TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>A Great part of the&s;e Papers were Printed eight years &s;ince, and &s;ome of them have &s;een the light no le&s;s than twelve: But &s;ince that the Copies have been di&s;po&s;ed of, and the Impre&s;&s;ions &s;old, the <HI>Book&s;eller</HI> hath thought fit to Reprint them together. In order to which, whil&s;t he gave me the Opportunity to read them over, I could not omit the making of divers Additions, and adjoyn|ing another Journey through the delightful Country of <HI>Lombardy:</HI> Calling to mind the Magnificence of &s;ome <HI>Roman</HI> Antiquities, and the Remarkable Actions of great Men in tho&s;e Quarters. Whereby I might give a &s;hort Ac|count of the &s;trange Fate and various Revolutions of divers of their ancient Cities. As to the natural Curio&s;ities and Ob&s;ervations in the fir&s;t parts, it would be unnece&s;&s;ary to make any Introduction, they having now run through &s;o ma|ny hands. I can only &s;ay, that what you had in &s;cattered parts before, are here compacted together in one intire Vo|lume, and hope for the &s;ame kind Acceptance. The num|ber of the Cuts are increa&s;ed, and the Figures of divers Habits, Medals and Antiquities, added: The Particular De&s;cription of which, in this <HI>Preface</HI> would prevent the &s;a|tisfaction of con&s;idering them in their proper places; to which I &s;hall refer you, wi&s;hing you the &s;ame plea&s;ure in viewing them there, that I have had formerly in beholding them in their due Situations, and in the Contemplation and De&s;cription of them afterwards.</P>

THE General De&s;cription OF HUNGARY.</HEAD>
<P>HOW far <HI>H&V;NGARIA</HI> exceeds other Countries of <HI>Europe</HI> in Mines, Baths and Mineral-waters; becau&s;e I have el&s;ewhere given a particular account of &s;uch Sub|jects, I &s;hall at pre&s;ent omit their repetitions, and at this time add &s;ome other Con&s;iderables; and in the fir&s;t place &s;ay, That it aboundeth not only in tho&s;e, but is al&s;o the be&s;t Rivered Country in <HI>Europe:</HI> nor doth any Region thereof afford &s;o many noble and u&s;eful Streams.</P>
<P>On the Ea&s;t &s;ide it is wa&s;hed with that Noble and Navigable River <HI>Tibi&s;cus,</HI> or the <HI>Tei&s;&s;e,</HI> ari&s;ing in the Country of <HI>Maromorus,</HI> at the foot of the high <HI>Carpathian</HI> Hills: which, having received the <HI>Mari&s;cus</HI> or <HI>Mari&s;a,</HI> and many Rivers into it, runneth into the <HI>Danube,</HI> between <HI>Varadine,</HI> St. <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Belgrade.</HI> By this River comes down the great quantity of natural Stone-&s;alt, brought from many Salt-mines in <HI>Hungary</HI> and <HI>Tran&s;ylvania;</HI> whereof a great part is brought up the <HI>Danube</HI> to all Places, as far as <HI>Presburg;</HI> (it being prohibited to be car|ried any higher) lea&s;t it &s;hould hinder the &s;ale of the <HI>Austrian</HI> Salt, upon which the Emperor hath an Impo&s;t, and no &s;mall quantity al&s;o down the <HI>Danube,</HI> and afterwards up the River <HI>Morava</HI> into <HI>Servia</HI> and neighbouring Countries.</P>
<P>On the We&s;t &s;ide runs the River <HI>Arabo</HI> or <HI>Rab,</HI> ri&s;ing in <HI>Styria,</HI> and running into the <HI>Danube</HI> by <HI>Javrinum</HI> or <HI>Rab.</HI> A con&s;iderable River receiving the <HI>Lauffnitz, Pinca, Guncz,</HI> and other Rivers into it. And now lately more famous for the defeat of the <HI>Turks,</HI> under <HI>Achmet</HI> the Grand <HI>Vi&s;ier,</HI> by the Imperial Forces, at St. <HI>Gothard,</HI> nigh this River. The di&s;cour&s;e hereof was fre&s;h, when I was at the City of <HI>Rab:</HI> and ma|ny I found, who &s;aw the Corps of Men and Hor&s;es floating in that Stream.</P>
<P>Upon the Southern Parts are con&s;iderable, the River <HI>Dravus</HI> or <HI>Drau,</HI> which ari&s;ing in the Territory of <HI>Saltzburgland,</HI> a part of old <HI>Noricum,</HI> runs a long cour&s;e through <HI>Carinthia</HI> and <HI>Hungary,</HI> and falls into the <HI>Danube</HI> near <HI>Erdoed,</HI> or old <HI>Teutoburgium;</HI> after it hath pa&s;&s;ed from its head about three hundred Miles. About its entrance into <HI>Hunga|ry,</HI> it receiveth into it the long River <HI>Mur;</HI> and, far above this, nearer its original I found it a con&s;iderable Stream: having pa&s;&s;ed the &s;ame by a good Bridg as high as <HI>Villach</HI> or <HI>Villaco,</HI> and between <HI>Clagenfort</HI> and Mount <HI>Leubell</HI> in <HI>Carinthia,</HI> I pa&s;&s;ed the &s;ame al&s;o by two long Wooden Bridges, and an I&s;land in the middle between them.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="4">
On the &s;ame &s;ide is al&s;o the noble River <HI>Savus,</HI> or the <HI>Sau;</HI> which a|ri&s;ing in <HI>Carinthia,</HI> entreth the <HI>Danube</HI> at <HI>Belgrade;</HI> continuing a long cour&s;e of about three hundred Miles, and &s;welling by the acce&s;&s;ion of many good Rivers. Being at <HI>Carnodunum</HI> or <HI>Crainburg,</HI> an hand&s;om Town, not far di&s;tant from the Head, it appeared a con&s;iderable Stream; which is afterwards &s;o enlarged, as to have remarkable I&s;lands in it, as that of <HI>Metubaris,</HI> to the We&s;t of old <HI>Sirmium,</HI> and that of <HI>Segestica</HI> or <HI>Si&s;&s;eck,</HI> by <HI>Zagrabia,</HI> containing of old a &s;trong and famous Town; unto which the old <HI>R mans</HI> brought their Commodities from <HI>Aquileia,</HI> and &s;o by Land to <HI>Labach</HI> or <HI>Nauportus;</HI> from thence unto <HI>Segestica,</HI> and forwards, for the &s;upply of tho&s;e Provinces and their Garri&s;ons and Forces in them. Between the&s;e two noble Currents of the <HI>Dravus</HI> and the <HI>Savus,</HI> lyeth a fair and long <HI>Inter-amnian</HI> Country, wherein <HI>Solyman</HI> the Magnificent cho&s;e a &s;afe retreat, until he came to <HI>Bel|grade:</HI> when, with about four hundred thou&s;and Men, which he brought to take <HI>Vienna,</HI> he dared not to meet the Forces of <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth, then encamped before that City.</P>
<P>Upon the North part of <HI>Hungary,</HI> are the Rivers ari&s;ing from the <HI>Carpathian</HI> Mountains, which divide <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Hungary;</HI> more parti|cularly the River <HI>Gran,</HI> which runs into the <HI>Danube,</HI> over again&s;t <HI>Strigonium</HI> or <HI>Gran;</HI> and al&s;o the River <HI>Waag</HI> or <HI>Vagus,</HI> which comes in above <HI>Comara:</HI> which <HI>Stuckius,</HI> an ocular Witne&s;s, conceiveth to e|qual the <HI>Po</HI> in <HI>Italy.</HI> I am &s;ure, at <HI>Frei&s;tat,</HI> above fifty Miles, before it di&s;chargeth into the <HI>Danube,</HI> it is a very large Stream, and hath a long Bridge over it; part whereof was broken down by the Ice, the &s;ame year when I was there. And far above it, nearer the head, there is al&s;o a con&s;iderable Bridge at <HI>Tren&s;chin,</HI> a fair Town, which gives the name unto that Country, and much re&s;orted unto for its hot Baths and Mineral Waters; having no le&s;s than thirty two plentiful Springs.</P>
<P>The great <HI>Danubius</HI> or <HI>Thonau</HI> continues its Stream quite through <HI>Hungary;</HI> and no one Province hath a larger &s;hare of it; for account|ing from the City of <HI>Vlme</HI> in <HI>Swabenland</HI> or <HI>Suevia,</HI> where it begin|neth to be Navigable, it continues a long cour&s;e, pa&s;&s;ing by <HI>Ingol&s;tad, Ratisbone, Straubing, Pa&s;&s;au, Lintz</HI> and <HI>Vienna</HI> unto <HI>Presburg;</HI> from whence through <HI>Hungary</HI> it makes a cour&s;e of above three hundred Miles, before it pa&s;&s;es by <HI>Belgrade:</HI> To omit the long Stream thereof in its farther progre&s;s, when having wa&s;hed the Shoars of <HI>Servia, Bul|garia, Wallachia</HI> and <HI>Moldavia,</HI> with many mouths it entreth the <HI>Eu|xine</HI> or <HI>Bla k-Sea:</HI> having in this long pa&s;&s;age drank in above &s;ixty con|&s;iderable Rivers; and in &s;ober account performed a cour&s;e of above fifteen hundred Miles. Whereby it may tolerably admit the double name of <HI>Danubius</HI> and <HI>Ister,</HI> properly applyed unto di&s;tinct Parts thereof.</P>
<P>So that, altho I have &s;een the <HI>Danubius,</HI> for about &s;even hundred Miles; yet cannot tell, whether I may certainly &s;ay, that I have &s;een a|ny part of <HI>Ister.</HI> For <HI>Strabo</HI> a&s;cribes that name unto it, below its <HI>Cataract,</HI> or great fall, which happenes about <HI>Axiopolis,</HI> in <HI>Moe&s;ia</HI> in|ferior, or <HI>Bulgaria.</HI> But <HI>Appianus,</HI> and later Account, define it to be|gin at its concurrence with the <HI>Savus</HI> at <HI>Belgrade:</HI> and if &s;o, yet we had but a &s;hort &s;ight of the <HI>I&s;ter;</HI> which travelling more up into <HI>Ser|via,</HI> we were fain to leave at <HI>Hi&s;&s;argich.</HI> And of this <HI>I&s;ter</HI> or lower part of the River, many things are &s;poken and related by the Ancients, which are not &s;o plainly verifiable of <HI>Danubius.</HI></P>

Be&s;ides the&s;e large Rivers above named, there are &s;ome others, taken notice of al&s;o by <HI>Pliny;</HI> and e&s;teemed <HI>Huvii non ignobiles.</HI> The <HI>Sar|vizza</HI> or <HI>Orpanus,</HI> ari&s;ing near <HI>Ve&s;prinium,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ing by <HI>Alba Regalis,</HI> runs into the <HI>Danube,</HI> which I pa&s;&s;ed over at <HI>Jeni,</HI> or <HI>nova Palan|ka.</HI> The River <HI>Walpo</HI> or <HI>Vulpanus,</HI> ari&s;ing above the Town of <HI>Walpo,</HI> which was taken by <HI>Solyman,</HI> in his march to <HI>Alba Regalis,</HI> or <HI>Stull-Wei&s;&s;enburg.</HI> We pa&s;&s;ed over it by <HI>Walcovar,</HI> and the River <HI>Bo&s;neth</HI> or <HI>Bacun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">hus,</HI> which runs into the <HI>Savus,</HI> not far from old <HI>Sirmi|um.</HI></P>
<P>As this Country excels in Rivers, &s;o has it al&s;o many con&s;idera|ble and long Bridges. There is a long Bridge of Boats over the <HI>Danube,</HI> between <HI>Strigonium</HI> and <HI>Barchan,</HI> which is the fir&s;t Bridge on this Ri|ver, which we meet with from the great Wooden Bridge at <HI>Vienna,</HI> which takes above two thou&s;and Trees to plancher it. Upon the &s;hoar of St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s <HI>I&s;land</HI> by <HI>Virouichitz,</HI> I took notice of a ruine of Stones, where the <HI>Turks</HI> told us, there had been formerly a Stone Bridge: but the <HI>Turks</HI> in the&s;e Parts, think it be&s;t to make Bridges of Boats; which they &s;o hand&s;omly contrive, as to open a pa&s;&s;age for Boats and Ve&s;&s;els of burthen to pa&s;s; &s;o that he that beholds tho&s;e in the&s;e Parts, will not wonder at the Bridges of Boats at <HI>Rouen,</HI> and <HI>Grenoble</HI> in <HI>France.</HI> Between <HI>Buda</HI> and <HI>Pest,</HI> there is a Bridge of Boats over the <HI>Danube,</HI> where it runs all in one Stream, of above half a Mile long, the be&s;t I have &s;een of this kind; and if <HI>Sigi&s;mund</HI> had lived to effect his De|&s;ign, of making a notable Stone Bridge in this Place, there had proba|bly been no Bridge in <HI>Europe</HI> to compare with it. There is al&s;o a Bridge at <HI>Calocza,</HI> formerly an <HI>Archbi&s;hop</HI>'s Sea, and a hand&s;ome and well-contrived Bridge, by <HI>Walcovar</HI> over the River <HI>Walpo.</HI> But that of <HI>E&s;&s;eck,</HI> or <HI>Mur&s;a</HI> of old, is &s;carce to be parallel'd with any other; built partly over the <HI>Dravus,</HI> and partly over the <HI>Fenns,</HI> which are often overflowed. The Bridge is five Miles at lea&s;t in length, having Towers built upon it at the di&s;tance of every quarter of a Mile: It is hand|&s;omly railed on each &s;ide, and &s;upported by great Trees, erected under it; nine or ten in a rank, unto each Arch. That part of the Bridge, which was built over the <HI>Dravus,</HI> was burnt down by Count <HI>Nicholas Serin,</HI> in the late <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Wars between <HI>Leopoldus</HI> the Fir&s;t, Emperor of <HI>Germany,</HI> and <HI>Sultan Mahomet</HI> the Fourth: and is now &s;upplyed by a Bridge of Boats, &s;omewhat below the former; which I pa&s;&s;ed o|ver in <HI>September,</HI> 1669. The <HI>Turks</HI> did not rebuild it in the &s;ame place, becau&s;e the Supporters below the Water, when the fire cea&s;ed, were &s;o &s;trongly fa&s;tned and hard, that it would have co&s;t them too great a labour to get them up. By this Bridge the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Forces pa&s;s into <HI>Hungary:</HI> and at this place the unfortunate King <HI>Ludovicus</HI> thought to have &s;topped the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Army which marched under <HI>So|lyman.</HI> And lately Count <HI>Serini</HI> undertook a long March to burn the &s;ame, to prevent Supplies from coming to the <HI>Vi&s;ier,</HI> who was with his Army in other parts of <HI>Hungary.</HI></P>
<P>And as there are &s;till many Bridges over the upper <HI>Danube,</HI> &s;o have there al&s;o been in Old time upon the lower, or <HI>I&s;trian</HI> part thereof. <HI>Darius</HI> King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> made a Bridge of Boats over that Mouth of the <HI>I&s;ter</HI> called <HI>O&s;tium Sacrum. Nicephorus</HI> relates, that <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> built a Stone Bridge over it. But the mo&s;t remarkable and admirable Bridge, was that, built by the Emperor <HI>Adrian,</HI> and de&s;cribed by <HI>Dion</HI> the Hi|&s;torian: whereof there are &s;till &s;ome Ruines, not far from <HI>Severin,</HI> a|bout
<PB N="4" REF="6">
twenty <HI>Hungarian</HI> Miles from <HI>Belgrade.</HI> This Bridge con&s;i&s;ted of twenty Piles of &s;quare Stone of an hundred foot high, be&s;ides the Foundation: of &s;ixty foot in breadth, and the di&s;tance between each of them one hundred and &s;eventy foot; and conjoyned by Arches, upon the which was this In&s;cription,</P>

<P>And, as a Memorial hereof, many <HI>Roman</HI> Coins were &s;tamped, and &s;ome in Silver, not yet rare among us, with this In&s;cription, DANU|VIUS.</P>
<P>No River affordes &s;o large and peopled I&s;lands. Between <HI>Vicegrad</HI> and <HI>Vacia,</HI> there is a fair and large I&s;land, called St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s I&s;land. Another a little below <HI>Buda,</HI> again&s;t the We&s;t &s;ide of which &s;tands <HI>Adom,</HI> extending forty Miles; and exceeds that of the <HI>I&s;le of Man,</HI> containing many Villages in it; upon part whereof the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> For|ces encamped, when they came to rai&s;e the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Siege at <HI>Buda,</HI> and was the great omi&s;&s;ion and error of the Chri&s;tians, that they for|tified not in that I&s;land. Another again&s;t <HI>Mohatch:</HI> another about the entrance of the <HI>Dravus:</HI> and a new one hard by <HI>Belgrade,</HI> made by the &s;ettling of the <HI>Silt</HI> or <HI>Ou&s;e</HI> brought down by the <HI>Savus</HI> and the <HI>Danube;</HI> where thirty five years ago there was no face of an I&s;land, but is now full of Trees; how this may advantage or di&s;advantage <HI>Belgrade,</HI> future times may &s;hew. But the <HI>Turks</HI> are &s;o &s;ecure and fearle&s;s of any Forces, that may ever hurt them in the&s;e Parts, that they have no con&s;ideration of &s;uch things. And allowing the River <HI>Leyta</HI> to be the boundary of <HI>Austria,</HI> the I&s;land of <HI>Schut,</HI> or <HI>In&s;ula Ci|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">uorum,</HI> will prove mo&s;t con&s;iderable of any; containing many good Towns, as <HI>Comora, Sumarien;</HI> be&s;ides very many Villages. And pa&s;|&s;ing through it, I found it well peopled and ordered again&s;t Incur&s;i|ons; wherein there have been divers, formerly made by <HI>Turks, Tar|tars,</HI> and rebellious Forces.</P>
<P>No River what&s;oever, &s;o far from its di&s;charge into the Sea, af|fordes more Naval Ve&s;&s;els of &s;trength and &s;ufficiency for Fight; nor hath any afforded the like &s;ignal Engagements and Encounters, at this di|&s;tance from the Sea. The Emperor hath &s;ome Ve&s;&s;els of War hand&s;om|ly built, like Gallies at <HI>Vienna, Presburg</HI> and <HI>Comora;</HI> and an <HI>Ar&s;enal</HI> for provi&s;ion of many upon occa&s;ion. The <HI>Turk</HI> at <HI>Strigonium, Buda, Belgrade,</HI> and other places below.</P>
<P>At the Siege of <HI>Belgrade, Mahomet</HI> the great brought two hundred Ships and Gallies, well appointed, up the Stream. And the <HI>Hungarians</HI> &s;ent<NOTE PLACE="marg">Turki&s;h History.</NOTE> &s;o many down the Stream, from <HI>Buda,</HI> that after a &s;harp encoun|ter, they took twenty of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;els, and forced the re&s;t on Shoar near the Camp; &s;o that, to prevent falling into the Enemies hand, <HI>Mahomet</HI> was fain to cau&s;e them to be &s;et on fire. The <HI>Chri&s;ti|ans</HI> had a great Fleet at the Siege of <HI>Buda,</HI> when all mi&s;carried under<NOTE PLACE="marg">Turki&s;h Hi&s;tory.</NOTE> Count <HI>Regen&s;dorff.</HI> For the Hi&s;tory delivers, that the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Fleet con&s;i&s;ted of four and twenty Galliots, about four&s;core &s;mall Pinnaces, and little le&s;s than an hundred Ships of Burthen, and other great Boats.
<PB N="5" REF="6">
By the help of &s;uch Naval Ve&s;&s;els <HI>Wolfgandus Hodder</HI> did a good piece of Service, when <HI>Solyman</HI> be&s;ieged <HI>Vienna;</HI> for he came out of <HI>Presburg</HI> with armed Ve&s;&s;els, and &s;unk the Ve&s;&s;els &s;ent from <HI>Buda</HI> with the great Ordnance, to batter the Walls of <HI>Vienna.</HI></P>
<P>And as this Country aboundeth in Rivers, &s;o is it not without &s;ome notable Lakes, as the Lake <HI>Balaton</HI> or <HI>Plat&s;ee,</HI> or <HI>Volcaea</HI> of old, extend|ing a great length between <HI>Ve&s;prinium</HI> and the <HI>Dravus,</HI> with &s;ome &s;trong Forts upon it. This Lake put a &s;top unto the cruelty of <HI>Soly|man</HI>'s Souldiers, who de&s;troyed all from <HI>Buda</HI> unto the Lake <HI>Balaton.</HI> And &s;ince it lyeth on the Ea&s;t of the River <HI>Leyta,</HI> we may al&s;o reckon in the <HI>New&s;idler</HI> Sea, a plea&s;ant Lake, &s;even <HI>German</HI> Miles long, and three broad: &s;o called from <HI>New&s;idel,</HI> a &s;mall Town, of one &s;treet and &s;ome backward Hou&s;es, with a &s;mall &s;quare Ca&s;tle upon an Hill by it, from whence I had a good pro&s;pect o|ver all the Lake. In the Commotions of <HI>Bot&s;cay,</HI> fourteen Villages a|bout this Lake were burnt by <HI>Turks, Tartars</HI> and rebellious <HI>Heyducks.</HI> The <HI>Hungarians</HI> call it <HI>Terteu</HI> and <HI>Pliny, Pei&s;o.</HI> It is in the middle way between <HI>Vienna</HI> and <HI>Sabaria,</HI> the birth-place of Saint <HI>Martin.</HI> The long extended plain of <HI>Pampus,</HI> in <HI>Paraguay</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> exceeds all others, as being two thou&s;and Miles in length. And I have heard that famous Navigator, Captain <HI>Narborough,</HI> &s;ay, who not long &s;ince, was Commander of the <HI>Sweep&s;takes,</HI> and made a Voyage in her into the <HI>South-Sea,</HI> that there is all low Land from the River of <HI>Plate,</HI> unto the middle of the Straights of <HI>Magellan. Mo&s;covia</HI> and <HI>Poland</HI> have long Plains, but many of them Woody, and ob&s;cured by Trees; but none more open and clear Plains than this Country. The greate&s;t Plains.

<P>As they exceed in many things, &s;o they are peculiar in &s;ome others; particularly in their <HI>Language,</HI> which is proper to them&s;elves, and dif|ferent from any other.

At the &s;ame time it fell out, that <HI>Mi&s;ca,</HI> King of <HI>Polonia,</HI> &s;ent about the &s;ame Errant: and a Crown was providing for him. But Pope <HI>Benedict</HI> the Eight, in the mean time was warned by an Angelical <HI>Apparition,</HI> to &s;end the Crown unto King <HI>Stephen;</HI> which accordingly he did, which probably begot that great Venerati|on and high Opinion, they have ever &s;ince had of it.</P>
<P>The Crown it &s;elf is al&s;o &s;ingular in its Fa&s;hion and Figure; for it is a low Crown, with a Cro&s;s upon it, with four Leaves or Turnings up about it; one whereof is as large as the other three, at lea&s;t as two thereof.

<P>Though the <HI>Hungarians</HI> want not Ingenuity, Indu&s;try, and &s;ufficient parts for Learning, and liberal Arts; yet have they been more addicted unto <HI>Martial affairs,</HI> than unto deep Learning: Even the <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> and <HI>Clergy-men</HI> proving &s;tout Soldiers; and no le&s;s than &s;ix <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> were &s;lain, with their King <HI>Ludovicus,</HI> in that fatal Battel of <HI>Mohatch.</HI></P>

The <HI>Roman</HI> Armies being much in this Country, no wonder it is, that &s;o many <HI>Coins</HI> of <HI>Copper, Gold,</HI> and <HI>Silver</HI> are to be found in it: Whereof I obtained no &s;mall number at <HI>Petronell,</HI> or Old <HI>Carnuntum,</HI> which was a Part of <HI>Pannonia.</HI> And at <HI>Sene,</HI> or <HI>Senia,</HI> &s;ituated near the <HI>Danube,</HI> I met with very many.

<P>Near the Town of <HI>Deva</HI> or <HI>Devas,</HI> was found great &s;tore of <HI>Trea&s;ure,</HI> by the Pea&s;ants of the Country, under an Ancient Ca&s;tle or Palace, all ruined and decayed.

The Storm and rage of water being pa&s;t, and the Sun &s;hining on the&s;e, made a marvellous glittering; which per|ceived by the Pea&s;ants, they remained ravi&s;hed with joy; and taking them up, they al&s;o found a <HI>Golden Serpent:</HI> which afterwards Gene|ral <HI>Ca&s;talde</HI> &s;ent unto <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> with a part of the&s;e Ancient <HI>Medals.</HI> This being an ancient Cu&s;tom with tho&s;e who buried their Trea&s;ure, to place <HI>Serpents</HI> there, in token of a Faithful keeper. After the Pea|&s;ants had taken, no man knew what, others took from thence more than Twenty thou&s;and <HI>Ducats.</HI> And the report was, that they might have taken an hundred Thou&s;and. For that had &s;ometimes been the abode of King <HI>Ly&s;imachus.</HI> Whereof <HI>Ferdinand</HI> had a Thou&s;and, and <HI>Ca&s;talde</HI> three Hundred. Which Coin remained in this place from <HI>Ly&s;imachus</HI>'s time.

Whereof I pre&s;ented &s;ome unto <HI>Petrus Lambecias,</HI> who &s;hewed them unto the Emperor. This place, being in the contribution Country to the <HI>Turks,</HI> hath been little enquired into; and therefore the Antiquities thereof were the more welcome. Among&s;t all the In&s;criptions of <HI>Gruter,</HI> I find but one or two of <HI>Senia.</HI> The People &s;ay, this place was formerly called <HI>Apollo|nia,</HI> but without any good ground.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing from <HI>Raab</HI> to <HI>Dotis,</HI> St. <HI>Martinsberg</HI> offers it &s;elf to view; an hand&s;ome Town, and &s;trong Hold, upon the top of a high Hill, over|looking all the Country.

<P><HI>Dotis, Tata,</HI> or <HI>Theodata,</HI> about twelve <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> miles from <HI>Gomora,</HI> where there is a Ca&s;tle with a Ditch about it, and al&s;o &s;ome Natural Baths near it. It hath been often taken and retaken: <HI>Graff Zacki,</HI> a Noble <HI>Hungarian,</HI> was then Governor, who&s;e &s;ingular Civilities I mu&s;t always acknowledge; and indeed in the&s;e parts, I was at be&s;t con|tent in the company of Souldiers, for they commanded all, and were generous and free hearted Per&s;ons, and could commonly &s;peak either <HI>Latine, High-Dutch&punc;</HI> or <HI>Italian;</HI> my company was the more accepta|ble to them, becau&s;e I had &s;een many parts of <HI>Europe</HI> before, which they would much enquire after.</P>
<P>But to return into the <HI>road</HI> again; we parted from <HI>Comora,</HI> being towed by a <HI>Saick</HI> of twenty four oars. The <HI>Hungarians</HI> rowing up|on one &s;ide, and the <HI>Germans</HI> on the other, they &s;aluted the Fortre&s;s with two &s;mall Guns, which they carried at the head of the <HI>Saick,</HI> and &s;o we pa&s;&s;ed by <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ne, Ne&s;mil, Rodwan,</HI> and came to <HI>Motch,</HI> the exact place of the Frontiers. Here we expected a <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Convoy; which coming betimes in the morning, we made ready for them; their Offi|cers went fir&s;t on &s;hoar, then our <HI>Veyda</HI> or <HI>Veyuod</HI> with the Interpre|ter, and chiefe&s;t of the company, both parties walking &s;lowly, and at meeting gave hands to one another, then we delivered our Boat unto the <HI>Turks,</HI> which they fa&s;tned to their <HI>Saick,</HI> and &s;ent one i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> to our Boat to &s;teer it: and turning about, &s;aluted the Chri&s;tians with one Gun, and then with eighteen Oars rowed down the <HI>Danube,</HI> we carrying the <HI>Eagle</HI> in our <HI>Flag,</HI> they the <HI>Double Sword, Star,</HI> and <HI>Half-Moon.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Turki&s;h Saick</HI> convoyed us to <HI>Strigonium</HI> or <HI>Gran,</HI> and &s;et our Boat on &s;hoar in the Town, and &s;o left us; the Governor al&s;o took no notice of us, either in hopes of a pre&s;ent, or &s;ome private intere&s;t; but an <HI>Aga,</HI> who came with four troops of Hor&s;e from <HI>Newhew&s;ell,</HI> being
<PB N="20" REF="14">
come into the Ca&s;tle, asked the Governor (as we were informed by a <HI>Turk,</HI> that came unto us) what he meaned to have &s;o little care of his head, to deal with us after this manner? who were not &s;ent to him, or to a <HI>Ba&s;&s;a,</HI> or a <HI>Vi&s;ier,</HI> but to the <HI>Sultan,</HI> and no doubt had a Pre|&s;ent for him: whereupon we were &s;oon di&s;patched.</P>
<P>This City of <HI>Gran, Strigonium</HI> or <HI>O&s;trogon,</HI> is &s;eated on the South|&s;ide of the <HI>Danube</HI> near the Confluence with the River <HI>Gran,</HI> divided into the upper and lower, and both walled; the lower <HI>Wall</HI> doth well command the <HI>Danube.</HI> St. <HI>Thomas Hill,</HI> hard by the Town, is al&s;o walled, becau&s;e it commandeth the Town: There are in this place Natural Baths of a moderate heat. This hath been the Metropolitan City of <HI>Hungary,</HI> where St. <HI>Stephen,</HI> the fir&s;t Chri&s;tian King of <HI>Hungary,</HI> was born; and King <HI>Stephen</HI> the third buried.</P>
<P>Scarce any place has &s;uffered more &s;trong and notable Sieges; be|&s;ieged in vain by <HI>John,</HI> King of <HI>Hungary,</HI> taken by <HI>Solyman,</HI> recover|ed by Count <HI>Mansfelt</HI> for <HI>Matthias,</HI> the Arch-Duke; be&s;ieged again in vain, but taken in the time of <HI>Sultan Achmet,</HI> by the mutinous ba&s;e|ne&s;s of the Chri&s;tian Defendants, who &s;hutting up Count <HI>Dampier,</HI> the Governor, delivered the place unto <HI>Aly-Beg</HI> the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> General; but after many years it was taken again by the Chri&s;tians under the Duke of <HI>Lorraine,</HI> in the year 1683. Over again&s;t <HI>Strigonium</HI> lieth <HI>Barchan;</HI> between the&s;e two places there is a Bridge of Boats.</P>
<P>From <HI>Strigonium</HI> we pa&s;&s;ed to <HI>Vicegrade</HI> or <HI>Vizzegrade:</HI> The upper Ca&s;tle of this place is &s;eated upon a very high Rock, where the Crown of <HI>Hungary</HI> hath been formerly kept: the lower Ca&s;tle hath been fair; there is al&s;o a hand&s;ome Fabrick of &s;quare Stones, and Arches, the ruines whereof do &s;till remain: this place was retaken from the <HI>Turks</HI> by the Forces of the Arch-Duke <HI>Matthias,</HI> in the time of <HI>Mahomet</HI> the Third, but betrayed, and delivered up by the Treachery of the <HI>Heyducks</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Sultan Achmet. Charles</HI> King of <HI>Naples,</HI> and &s;worn King of <HI>Hungary,</HI> was wounded on the head by <HI>Forchatz;</HI> and being carried into the Ca&s;tle, under pretence of laying a Pla&s;ter on his head, was &s;trangled. This place yielded to the Duke of <HI>Lorraine,</HI> 1684.</P>
<P>Over again&s;t <HI>Vizzegrade</HI> lieth <HI>Maroz,</HI> where there is a large Church; and the place having voluntarily &s;ubmitted unto the <HI>Turks,</HI> the Chri|&s;tians paying a &s;mall Tribute, lived under no great oppre&s;&s;ion. Be|low this Town, the <HI>Danube</HI> divides, and makes a fair large I&s;land, called St. <HI>Andrews</HI> I&s;land, &s;till rowing down, by which we pa&s;&s;ed by <HI>Virovichitz,</HI> a noted place for plea&s;ant Vineyards and good Grapes, and an old ruine of Stone, upon the &s;hoar of St. <HI>Andrews</HI> I&s;le, where the <HI>Turks</HI> told us, there was formerly a Stone Bridge, we came to <HI>Vacia,</HI> in for|mer times a Bi&s;hop See, which hath now two <HI>Mo&s;ches,</HI> and one Chri&s;tian Church without the Wall. This place was &s;eized upon, &s;acked and burnt by the <HI>Turks,</HI> 1541. but taken by the Emperors Forces, under the Command of the Duke of <HI>Lorraine,</HI> in the Year 1684. after he had overthrown the <HI>Turks</HI> in Battel near the Town, but was quitted again at the latter end of the <HI>Autumn,</HI> there being a ridge of Hills near it which over-look the Town, and render it not ea&s;ie to be defended.</P>
<P>Here we changed our Convoy again, and pa&s;&s;ed unto <HI>Buda,</HI> the Capital City, and Royal Seat of the Kings of <HI>Hungaria,</HI> and the re&s;i|dence of a <HI>Turki&s;h Vi&s;ier,</HI> who hath divers <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's</HI> under him. It is a large City, and of a plea&s;ant &s;ituation; devided into the upper and
<PB N="21" REF="14">
lower Town, wherein are &s;ome ruines, and reliques of Magnificent Structures, rais'd by the <HI>Hungarian</HI> Kings, e&s;pecially <HI>Matthias Corvi|nus,</HI> who&s;e Palace the <HI>Vi&s;ier</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. But much abating of its anci|ent glory. There are al&s;o &s;ome fair <HI>Mo&s;ches, Caravan&s;ara's,</HI> and very Magnificent <HI>Baths.</HI> There is al&s;o a high Hill called St. <HI>Gerard</HI>'s Mount, which hath a Fort on the top, and over-looks the Town and Coun|try.</P>
<P>The natural Baths of <HI>Buda</HI> are e&s;teemed the noble&s;t of <HI>Europe,</HI> not only in re&s;pect of the large and hot Springs, but the Magnificence of their Buildings. For the <HI>Turks</HI> bathe very much, and though little cu|rious in mo&s;t of their private hou&s;es, yet are they very &s;umptuous in their publick Buildings, as their <HI>Chars</HI> or <HI>Caravan&s;ara's, Mo&s;ches, Bridges,</HI> and <HI>Baths</HI> declare.</P>
<P>There are eight Baths, whereof I had opportunity to take notice during my &s;tay at <HI>Buda,</HI> three toward the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>South-Ea&s;t</HI> part of the City, in the way leading towards <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and five towards the <HI>We&s;t</HI> end of the Town, in the way towards old <HI>offen,</HI> and <HI>Stri|gonium.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t is a large open Bath at the foot of a high rocky Hill, cal|led Purgatory, whereof the People have &s;ome odd and &s;crupulous Ap|prehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>The &s;econd is covered with a <HI>Cupola,</HI> and &s;tands nigh the &s;ame Hill, but more into the Town, and near a place where they u&s;e Tanning.</P>
<P>The third is called the <HI>Bath</HI> of the green Pillars, though at pre&s;ent they be of a red colour, it &s;tands over again&s;t a <HI>Caravan&s;ara.</HI> The Water is hot but tolerable without the Addition of cold water, it is impregnated with a petrefiing Juyce, which di&s;covers it &s;elf on the &s;ides of the <HI>Bath,</HI> upon the Spouts, and other places, and makes a grey Stone: The Exhalation from the <HI>Bath</HI> reverberated by the <HI>Cupola,</HI> by the Irons extended from one Column to another, and by the Capitals of the Pillars forms long Stones like <HI>I&s;icles,</HI> which hang to all the&s;e places.</P>
<P>The Water is let out at night, when the Women have done bathing, who often &s;tay late. The <HI>Bath</HI> is round, &s;et about with large Pillars &s;upporting a <HI>Cupola,</HI> which hath openings to let out the Steam, and yet the whole Room continues to be a hot Stove.</P>
<P>The <HI>Baths</HI> of the <HI>We&s;t</HI> end of the Town are fir&s;t, <HI>Tactelli,</HI> or the <HI>Bath</HI> of the Table, a &s;mall <HI>Bath</HI> covered: the Water white, and of a Sulphureous &s;mell; they drink of this as well as bathe in it; what they drink they receive from a Spout, bringing the Water into this place. I delivered a five-Sols piece to a <HI>Turk,</HI> who was bathing in it, to gild for me, which he did in half a Minute, by rubbing it between his fingers, while the hot Water fell from the Spout upon it.</P>
<P>The &s;econd is <HI>Barat Degrimene,</HI> or the Bath of the Powder-Mill, it ri&s;es in an open Pond near the High-way, and mixes with the fre&s;h Springs, which makes the Pond of a whiti&s;h colour in one part, and clear in the other; as al&s;o cold and hot in &s;everal parts. This convey|ed cro&s;s the High-way into a Powder Mill, becomes u&s;eful in making of Gun-powder.</P>
<P>The third is <HI>cuzzoculege,</HI> the little Bath, or the Bath of the <HI>Saint,</HI> for which name the <HI>Turks</HI> give a &s;uper&s;titious rea&s;on: It is kept by <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Monks. The Bath where the Springs ari&s;e, is &s;o hot as &s;carce
<PB N="22" REF="15">
to be endured; but being let out into another bathing place at &s;ome di&s;tance, it becomes tolerable and fit for u&s;e. This Water hath neither colour, &s;mell, nor ta&s;te different from common Water, and depo&s;eth no &s;ediment, only the &s;ides of the Bath are green, and have a fungous &s;ub|&s;tance all over.</P>
<P>The fourth is <HI>Caplia,</HI> a very noble Bath, but part of the Buildings was con&s;umed this year, 1669. by a great Fire that happened in <HI>Buda,</HI> but is &s;ince repaired by the <HI>Turks.</HI> The Water is very hot, not without a petrefying Juyce in it. The Building about is eight &s;quare, with a noble Bath in the middle, with a Circle of a Trench of Water about it for the better Ornament, to bathe the feet in; on every &s;ide it hath a <HI>Niche,</HI> wherein is a Fountain; in the middle of the Anti-Chamber, where they leave their Cloths, there is al&s;o a fair Stone Ba&s;on and a Fountain.</P>
<P>The fifth is the Bath of <HI>&V;elibey,</HI> which hath a &s;trong &s;ulphureous &s;mell; and a petrefying Juyce in it, and is &s;o hot, that to make it tolerable it requires the addition of cold Water; this is the noble&s;t of all. The Anti-Chamber is ve y large, the Bath-Room capacious, and high-Arch|ed, adorned with five <HI>Cupola</HI>'s; one a very fair one over the great round Bath in the middle; and one le&s;&s;er over each of the four corners, where are either Baths, or Bath-&s;toves for private u&s;e: in the&s;e the <HI>Turks</HI> take off the hair of their Bodies by a <HI>P&s;ilothrum</HI> mixt with <HI>Soap:</HI> it being not their Cu&s;tom to have any hair, except their Beards. Twelve Pillars &s;upport the great <HI>Cupola,</HI> between eight whereof are Fountains of hot Water, and between the others are places to &s;it down, where the Barbers and Bath-men attend; and each of the&s;e places has two Ci&s;terns of <HI>Free-stone,</HI> into which are let in hot Bath-water, and al|&s;o cold Water, to be mixed and tempered as every one plea&s;eth.</P>
<P>Men bathe in the Morning, and Women in the Afternoon. When any man intends to bathe, having entred the fir&s;t Rooms, he finds there divers Servants attending, who furni&s;h him with a Cloth and Apron. Then he puts off his Cloths and having put on the Apron, he enters the &s;econd Room, wherein is the great Bath, and &s;its on the &s;ide of the Bath, or between the Pillars near a Fountain, where the Barber &s;trongly rubs him with his hand opened, &s;tretching out his Armes, and lifting them up; after which the Party bathes. Then if he be a Subject of the grand <HI>Seignior</HI>'s, or it be the Cu&s;tom of his Country, he hath his head &s;haved, and if a young man, his beard, ex|cept the upper Lip; next the Barber rubs his Brea&s;t, Back, Armes, and Legs, with an hair Cloth, while he either &s;itteth, or lieth with his face downward, then wa&s;hes his head with <HI>Soap,</HI> and after throws cold Wa|ter upon him, all over his Body, and then he walks in the &s;team of the Bath for a time.</P>
<P>The <HI>Germans</HI> call this City <HI>Offen,</HI> and &s;ome will have it founded by <HI>Buda,</HI> the Brother of <HI>Attila,</HI> the Famous King of the <HI>Hunnes.</HI> And to &s;peak the truth among all the numerous Countries, and Places Conquered by that Warlike Nation, they could not choo&s;e out indeed a nobler Seat to build a City in, where, be&s;ides the advantage of their natural Baths and Stoves, this being placed upon the Banks of the greate&s;t River in <HI>Europe,</HI> where it runs in one entire Stream, and the City ri&s;ing up by degrees to the top of Hills, affording from mo&s;t Streets of the Town, a Pro&s;pect of twenty Miles or more, on the other &s;ide of

the <HI>Danube,</HI> as far as ones eye can reach, with the view of <HI>Pest,</HI> and the long Bridge of Boats, and the beautiful fruitful Country about it, renders it mo&s;t exqui&s;itely plea&s;ant and delightful, and was the Royal Seat of the <HI>Hungarian</HI> Kings and Queens, till that <HI>Solyman</HI> the Mag|nificent, entered it with his Sons <HI>Selimus</HI> and <HI>Bajazet,</HI> on the Thir|teenth of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ugust,</HI> in the Year One Thou&s;and Five Hundred Forty One, and made a Decree that <HI>Buda</HI> &s;hould be from that day kept by a Gar|ri&s;on of <HI>Turks,</HI> and the Kingdom converted into a Province of the <HI>Tur|ki&s;h</HI> Empire and the Queen and her young Son, be &s;ent into the Coun|try of <HI>Lippa,</HI> beyond the River <HI>Tibi&s;cus,</HI> at a little di&s;tance from <HI>Buda</HI> or <HI>Offen:</HI> there is another Place called old <HI>Offen,</HI> conceived to be <HI>Si|cambria</HI> of old, where the <HI>Sicambrian</HI> Souldiers quartered, in the time of the <HI>Romans:</HI> and &s;ome Antiquities and In&s;criptions have been taken notice of in that place.</P>
<P>Over again&s;t <HI>Buda,</HI> upon the <HI>Eastern-&s;hoar</HI> of <HI>Danubius,</HI> &s;tands the City <HI>Pe&s;t,</HI> being Quadrangular and &s;eated upon a Plain: and by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ea&s;on of its Wall, and the Towers of the <HI>Mo&s;ches;</HI> makes a hand&s;om &s;how from <HI>Buda.</HI> It gives the name unto the County or <HI>Comi|tatus Pe&s;thien&s;is: Hungaria</HI> being divided into Counties, like <HI>England;</HI> between this place and <HI>Buda,</HI> the hand&s;om Bridge of Boats, is above half a Mile long.</P>
<P>The habit of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Women &s;eemed new and &s;trange to me: Breeches almo&s;t to their feet, a kind of Smock over them, and then a long Gown with their Head-dre&s;s, which &s;etches about, covering their face, except their eyes, and makes them look like Penitents: but it was not unplea&s;ant unto me, as taking away the occa&s;ion of Pride and Folly: though otherwi&s;e it can have no good grace in a &s;tran|ger's fancy.</P>
<P>During our Stay at <HI>Buda,</HI> we went into a <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Convent, where the Prior or Superior called <HI>Julpapa,</HI> or Father of the <HI>Ro&s;e,</HI> with &s;ome of his Brethren brought us into a large Room like a Chappel, and en|tertained us with Melons and Fruit: at parting, we gratified them with &s;ome pieces of Silver, which were kindly accepted. The <HI>Julpapa</HI> had his Girdle or Ceinture embo&s;&s;ed before with a whiti&s;h Stone, big|ger than the palm of my hand, which was <HI>Galactites</HI> or <HI>Milk-&s;tone;</HI> whereof they have a great opinion, becau&s;e in their belief, <HI>Mahomet</HI> turned a whole River in <HI>Arabia</HI> into this kind of <HI>Stone.</HI></P>
<P>We lodged at an old <HI>Ra&s;cians</HI> hou&s;e, where we were well accom|modated; having from it a fair Pro&s;pect over the <HI>Danube,</HI> the long <HI>Bridge</HI> and <HI>Pest,</HI> and a good part of the Country. Divers <HI>Turks</HI> and &s;ome <HI>Chiau&s;es</HI> re&s;orted unto us, where they were treated to their con|tent. The Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e was thought to hold &s;ecret corre|&s;pondence with a <HI>Franci&s;can</HI> Friar of <HI>Pe&s;t,</HI> and to give intelligence of Occurrences unto the Mini&s;ters of State at <HI>Gomora, Rab,</HI> and <HI>Vienna;</HI> he prevailed with me to pen a Letter in <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Italian;</HI> wherein I was not unwilling to grati&s;ie him, becau&s;e it contained nothing, be|&s;ides an account of &s;ome Pri&s;oners, and the encroachment of the <HI>Ar|menian</HI> Merchants upon the Trade.</P>
<P>As we were riding in the City, divers of the common <HI>Turks</HI> murmu|red, that we &s;hould ride, where they went on foot.

At our return to this place, after two days &s;tay, the Governor &s;ent us with four and twenty Hor&s;e Souldiers into Chri&s;tendom again, the&s;e guarded us with great care, a day and a night, till they &s;aw us &s;afe at <HI>Dotis.</HI></P>

We went to &s;ee the place, where &s;o noble a Prince lo&s;t his life, and an incon&s;iderate Battel lo&s;t the Crown of <HI>Hungary.</HI> This Battel was fought the 29th day of <HI>October,</HI> in the Year 1526. <HI>Cotri&s;cus,</HI> who was near the King's Per&s;on when he was drowned, related the manner of it to the <HI>Hungarians,</HI> and &s;hewed them the place where he fell in, from whence the King's Body was afterwards taken up entire, and carried to <HI>Alba Regalis,</HI> where with great Solemnity it was buried among the Sepulchres of the other Kings of <HI>Hungary,</HI> his Prede|ce&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>Hereabouts we met with a Caravan of two or three hundred Per|&s;ons, &s;ome going to a place of Devotion, and having <HI>Janizaries</HI> with them, to guard them: others intending, by permi&s;&s;ion, to &s;eat them|&s;elves in other parts of <HI>Hungary.</HI> And in divers places I met with numerous droves of Oxen, driven towards <HI>Vienna,</HI> upon the account of the Ea&s;tern Company of that City, who furni&s;h that place and Country about, and are permitted to pa&s;s free by the <HI>Grand Seignior.</HI> This day we le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t <HI>Quinque Eccle&s;iae,</HI> and <HI>Zigeth</HI> on the right hand, this la&s;t is a &s;trong place &s;eated by the &s;ide of a Fenn, in which there is an I&s;land, and beyond that a Ca&s;tle.

But that which is mo&s;t remarkable here, is the well contrived Bridge of Wood, made partly over the River <HI>Dravus,</HI> and partly over the Fenns adjoyning, being five Miles long: being rayled, and having Towers at every quarter of a Mile: that part over the River <HI>Dravus,</HI> was burnt down by Count <HI>Nicolas Serini,</HI> in the la&s;t Wars, and ano|ther built &s;ince. He that beholds this Bridge, the Towers of Wood upon it, the &s;trong rayles and floar, and the numerous &s;upporters of it, cannot but wonder, how they &s;hould be &s;upplied with Wood to build it, or maintain it.

I &s;aw al&s;o two large places built of &s;tone, like unto the Exchange with two rows of Pillars over one another; but they were &s;o full of Merchants Goods, that they lo&s;t much of their beauty. There are al&s;o two large <HI>Beze&s;tens,</HI> or places, where the riche&s;t Commodities are &s;old. They are built in the form of a Cathedral Church, and within are like to the old Exchange, above &s;tairs.

<P>We lodged at an <HI>Armenian</HI> Merchant's hou&s;e, where we were hand|&s;omly accommodated.

This Town was ca&s;ually &s;et on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ire, while we were in it, and a great part of it burnt down; the fire encrea|&s;ing much before we got out of it. Here we met with many per&s;ons, who brought the Tribute, and a Pre&s;ent of Hawks out of <HI>Wallachia</HI> unto the Grand <HI>Seignior,</HI> then re&s;iding at <HI>Lari&s;&s;a.</HI></P>
<P>From hence, by <HI>I&s;bar,</HI> we came to <HI>Pyrlipe,</HI> fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ing the high Mountains of <HI>Pyrlipe</HI> in <HI>Macedonia,</HI> which &s;hine like Silver, as tho&s;e of <HI>Cli&s;sura;</HI> and, be&s;ide <HI>Mo&s;covia</HI> Gla&s;s, may contain good Minerals in their bowels. The Rocks of this Mountain are the mo&s;t craggy that I have &s;een; and ma&s;&s;y Stones lye upon &s;tones, without any Earth about them, and upon a ridge of a Mountain, many Steeples high, &s;tands the &s;trong Ca&s;tle of <HI>Marco Crollowitz,</HI> a man formerly famous in the&s;e Parts.</P>
<P>Then through a Plain Country we came to <HI>Mona&s;ter</HI> or <HI>Toli,</HI> a great Place, well peopled, and plea&s;antly Seated. Here the <HI>Sultana,</HI> who was great with Child at <HI>Lari&s;&s;a,</HI> was de&s;igned to be delivered&punc; and lye in. All accommodations being ordered to that purpo&s;e, where I afterwards heard &s;he was delivered of a Daughter, who lived not long after. The <HI>Turks,</HI> who have a high opinion of <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great, would have been glad to have had a Son of the Empire born in <HI>Macedonia.</HI></P>
<P>From hence to <HI>Filurina,</HI> and <HI>Ecci&s;&s;o Verbeni,</HI> where there are <HI>Aci|dulae</HI> of good e&s;teem, the Springs large, and plentiful. Before we de|&s;cended the Hill, which leads to this Town, we had a &s;ight before us of the famous Mount <HI>Olympus,</HI> about Seventy miles off; and on the left hand we &s;aw the Lakes of <HI>Petriski,</HI> and <HI>O&s;trova;</HI> they have a Traditi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n, that one of the&s;e Lakes was made, by taking great &s;tones out of the &s;ide of the Hills, whereby the Subterraneous water, finding vent, over-flowed the Neighbour Plaines.</P>
<P>We came afterwards to <HI>Egribugia,</HI> where we again left the Plains, and travelled over high rocky Hills to <HI>Sariggio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e.</HI> Whence pa&s;&s;ing through the River <HI>Injecora,</HI> we came to <HI>Sarvitza,</HI> a noted Place, built partly upon an Hill, and partly in the Plain. The Chri&s;tians live mo&s;t in the upper part, the <HI>Turks</HI> in the lower: there is al&s;o a Ca&s;tle upon a very high Rock: not far from hence we went through a pa&s;&s;age, cut through the Rocks, like to a great Gate, and a &s;mall River pa&s;&s;ing al&s;o

through it, which makes a fa&s;t Pa&s;s, and commands the pa&s;&s;age of this Country, which put me in mind of <HI>la Chiu&s;a,</HI> in the <HI>Julian Alpes,</HI> between <HI>Ven&s;one</HI> and <HI>Ponteva;</HI> which pa&s;&s;age the <HI>Venetians</HI> &s;hut up every night, we took notice al&s;o in our Journey of the fir&s;t <HI>Turki&s;h Mo&s;chea,</HI> which was built in the&s;e parts, upon that place where the <HI>Turks</HI> fir&s;t re&s;ted, after they had taken the &s;trong Ca&s;tle and Pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Sarvitza.</HI> Here we al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed by a Hill of a fine red Earth, whereof they make Pots and Ve&s;&s;els, like tho&s;e of <HI>Portugal</HI> Earth, which are of e&s;teem all about the&s;e Parts. We proceeded over dangerous Rocks, in narrow hanging ways &s;till on Hor&s;e-back; although we had little plea&s;ure to look down the Precipices on one hand, and &s;ee the Carka&s;|&s;es of Hor&s;es in &s;ome places, which had fallen down and broke their necks. Afterwards we had the Mount <HI>Olympus</HI> on our left hand, till we came to <HI>Ale&s;&s;one</HI> or <HI>Ale&s;swn,</HI> a con&s;iderable place; where there is a <HI>Greek</HI> Mona&s;tery, and Monks of the Order of St. <HI>Ba&s;il.</HI> The Mo|na&s;tery was of a different kind of building from any I had then &s;een. From hence pa&s;&s;ing over a River, we entered into a round Plain, of about five Miles over; with divers Towns plea&s;antly &s;eated in it. Then over an Hill again, which is a Spur of Mount <HI>Olympus;</HI> upon the top whereof an old Man &s;tood beating of a Drum, to give notice unto Pa&s;&s;engers on both &s;ides, that tho&s;e parts were free from Thieves. From this Hill as we de&s;cended, we had a good Pro&s;pect of the Plains<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pharibus.</NOTE> of <HI>The&s;&s;aly;</HI> and at the foot of it we turned to the left, and pa&s;&s;ed over a River, which runs from under a rocky Mountain, not in &s;mall Springs, but the whole body of the River together; and then through Vineyards, and Cotten Fields, to <HI>Tornovo,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Lari&s;&s;a,</HI> where the <HI>Ottoman Court</HI> re&s;ided: of which places we &s;hall &s;peak more hereafter.</P>
<P>In our return, we left the road, about <HI>Kaplanlih,</HI> and turned unto <HI>Skopia,</HI> a City of great Trade, and the large&s;t in the&s;e parts. <HI>Scopia</HI> or <HI>Scupi</HI> of <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> named <HI>&V;&s;copia</HI> by the <HI>Turks,</HI> is &s;eated in the re|mote&s;t parts of <HI>Mae&s;ia</HI> Superior, or the Confines of <HI>Macedonia,</HI> at the foot of Mount <HI>Orbelus,</HI> upon the River <HI>Vardar,</HI> or <HI>Axius,</HI> in a plea|&s;ant and plentiful Country, &s;eated partly on Hills, and partly on Plains. It was fir&s;t a Bi&s;hops, afterwards an Arch Bi&s;hops See; &s;till a plea&s;ant and populous place. There are &s;even hundred Tanners in it, and they Tann in great long Troughs of Stone, and make excellent Leather, wherewith they furni&s;h other parts. There are &s;ome hand&s;om Sepulchral Monuments, and many fair Hou&s;es, as that of the <HI>Cadih,</HI> and that belong|ing to the <HI>Emir,</HI> or one of <HI>Mahomets</HI> Kindred, who&s;e Father was of great e&s;teem in the&s;e parts. In the Court-yard of the <HI>Emir</HI>'s Hou&s;e, &s;tands a remarkable and peculiarly contrived Fountain, in manner of a Ca&s;tle, &s;et round with many Towers, out of the tops whereof the Water &s;prings forth. Their be&s;t Hou&s;es are furni&s;hed with rich Car|pets to tread upon: and the Roofs divided into Triangles, Quadrangles, and other Figures fairly gilded, and painted with &s;everal Colours, but without any Imagery or Repre&s;entation, either of Animal or Vegeta|ble. Here is al&s;o a fair <HI>Beze&s;tan,</HI> covered with Lead; many Streets co|vered over with Wood; and divers places are fair both within and without the Town, being &s;et off by Trees and plea&s;ant Hills and Dales.</P>
<P>There are a great number of <HI>Mo&s;chea</HI>'s or <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Churches. The

There is al&s;o an Arch, which &s;eems to be Ancient, and a rivolet running under it. A large Stone al&s;o which &s;eems to be part of a Pillar, with this In&s;cription SHANC. A little way out of the City, there is a no|ble <HI>Aqueduct</HI> of Stone, with about two hundred Arches, made from one Hill to another, over the lower ground or Valley between, which is a hand&s;ome Antiquity, and adds to the honour of this place.

<P>From hence we travelled to <HI>Cat&s;hanich,</HI> a Fortre&s;s that commands the pa&s;&s;age b tween the Hills; and afterwards advanced &s;o far, as to enter the famous Plains of <HI>Co&s;&s;ova</HI> in <HI>Bulgaria;</HI> which &s;ome take to be <HI>Campus Merulae,</HI> a Plain not very much exceeding <HI>Lincoln Heath,</HI> yet the Stage of great Actions.

In which Battle <HI>Lazarus</HI> was &s;lain: and <HI>Amurah,</HI> viewing the dead bodies, was &s;tabbed by <HI>Michael Cobilovitz,</HI> a Chri&s;tian Souldier, left for dead in the Field. <HI>Amurah</HI> hath in the&s;e Plains a Memorial Monument unto this day; and that part is called the Field of the Sepulchre: in the &s;ame Plains was al&s;o fought that remarkable Battle between <HI>Hunniades</HI> and <HI>Mahomet,</HI> for three days together; where <HI>Hunniades,</HI> having very unequal Forces, was at la&s;t over-thrown.</P>
<P>We proceeded forward to <HI>Pre&s;tina,</HI> a good Town, and where we ex|pected good accommodation; but having entered into a fair Room, we found a man lying down in it &s;ick of the Plague. So we con&s;ulted our &s;afety, and &s;tayed not long; and having a <HI>Gyp&s;ie</HI> to our Guide, we travelled through a Country thinly inhabited, but fruitful and plea&s;ant and were much refre&s;hed with fair <HI>Cornelions,</HI> which grew plentifully in the ways: we pa&s;&s;ed al&s;o by an hot Bath, a little on the right hand. The Bath is an arched Room well built, and very refre&s;hing unto Tra|vellers. It hath a red Sediment, and is impregnated with a <HI>&s;uccus lapide|&s;cens,</HI> and makes a gray Stone. It is within two hours going of <HI>Bella|cherqua</HI> or <HI>Cur&s;umn&egrave;,</HI> where I ob&s;erved a Convent and an old Church with two hand&s;om Towers: From whence pa&s;&s;ing over the Hill <HI>Ja&s;ne|batz,</HI> we came to <HI>E&s;helleck</HI> between the two <HI>Morava</HI>'s, and &s;o by a Ca&s;tle upon a Hill, near unto which is a noted Convent, wherein is kept the body of <HI>Kenez Lazarus,</HI> and the body of St. <HI>Romanus,</HI> and &s;o proceed|ed.

<HEAD>THE DESCRIPTION OF LARISSA AND THESSALY.</HEAD>
<P><HI>LARISSA</HI> is the chief City of <HI>The&s;saly,</HI> &s;eated by the River <HI>Peneus,</HI> the chief River of that Country. Upon the North it hath the Famous Mountain <HI>Olympus,</HI> and on the South a Plain Country. It is now inhabited by <HI>Chri&s;tians, Turks</HI> and <HI>Jews;</HI> hath fair <HI>Beze&s;tens,</HI> divers <HI>Turki&s;h Mo&s;chea's,</HI> and Chri&s;tian Churches in it. It is plea&s;antly &s;eated, and upon a ri&s;ing ground: on the upper part whereof &s;tands the Palace of the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> which he hath made u&s;e of during his re&s;idence in this place: it is contrived with jetting large Windows, on four &s;ides, near which he took his re|pa&s;t, and pa&s;s-time, according as the Wind &s;erved, or afforded the be&s;t ventilation.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o an Arch-Bi&s;hop's See, having divers Suffragan Bi&s;hops under it. The Reverend Father <HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> was then Arch-bi&s;hop. The Church of St. <HI>Achilleus</HI> is the Cathedral, where I heard Divine Service, the Arch-bi&s;hop being pre&s;ent, and &s;tanding in his Throne in his Epi&s;copal habit, and his Cro&s;ier in his hand; when three or four of us Strangers came into the Church, he &s;ent one to fume us with Incen&s;e and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">weet Odours.</P>
<P>The <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> kept his Court in this place for &s;ome years, in or|der to his Affairs in <HI>Candia,</HI> and for the great convenience of Hunting and Hawking, wherein he exceedingly delights. When I came away, it was &s;aid, that he would go to <HI>Negroponte;</HI> but he remained at <HI>La|ri&s;sa</HI> &s;ome months after, until he removed to <HI>Saloni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">hi,</HI> and afterwards to <HI>Adrianople.</HI></P>
<P>In the hot and dry Summer 1669. the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> pa&s;&s;ed above two months of that Sea&s;on upon the Neighbouring Mount <HI>Olympus,</HI> partly that he might have a large Pro&s;pect over the Plains, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span"> of the <HI>Aegaean Sea,</HI> and partly to enjoy fre&s;h Air, and be removed from the choaking heat of the Valleys; but this humour proved de&s;tructive to &s;ome hundreds of tho&s;e, which attended him; for it became &s;o cold

The <HI>Sultan</HI> him&s;elf &s;ell al&s;o into a di&s;tem|per, but it la&s;ted but three or four days: of Hor&s;es and Camels not a few peri&s;hed.

<P>The <HI>Greeks</HI> (who are forward to magnifie the Concerns of their Country,) &s;peak highly of Mount <HI>Olympus:</HI> and <HI>Homer</HI> would have it to be the habitation of <HI>Jupiter</HI> and the Gods, and to be without Clouds; but unto me &s;ome part of the <HI>Alpes</HI> &s;eem much higher; and I have &s;een Clouds above it; and in <HI>September</HI> there appeared no Snow upon it, which the high Peaks in the <HI>Alpes, Pyrenaean</HI> and <HI>Carpathian</HI> Mountains, be&s;ides many others in <HI>Europe,</HI> are never without.

<P>And not &s;taying there, he went along the River; and taking Boar, went out to Sea, and was taken in by great Ship, then ready to weigh Anchor.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Peneus,</HI> which runs by <HI>Lari&s;sa,</HI> is the chiefe&s;t in <HI>The&s;|&s;aly,</HI> and into which mo&s;t of the other Rivers run; ari&s;ing from Mount <HI>Pindus;</HI> and running into the <HI>Sinus Thermaicus,</HI> or Gulf of <HI>Salonichi,</HI> pa&s;&s;ing by the famous Valley of <HI>Tempe,</HI> and running between Mount <HI>Olympus</HI> and <HI>O&s;&s;a,</HI> into the Sea.</P>
<P>In that famous Expedition against the <HI>Graecians, Xerxes</HI> would have made his entrance by this way: for <HI>Herodotus</HI> delivers, that he fail|ed from <HI>Thermae,</HI> now <HI>Salonichi,</HI> unto the mouth of the River <HI>Peneus;</HI> to ob&s;erve, if there were any pa&s;&s;age, or any could be made, to enter into <HI>The&s;&s;aly;</HI> and finding, upon enquiry, that the River had no other pa&s;&s;age, and that it could not be turned: he &s;aid, That the <HI>The&s;&s;a|lians</HI> had done wi&s;ely to yield, and make their peace with him; for, by &s;topping of the River <HI>Peneus, The&s;&s;aly</HI> might have been drowned.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign"></NOTE> I found the Epithete of <HI>Homer</HI> very agreeable unto this River, for it hath a clear &s;tream and bottom, and the Fable of <HI>Apollo,</HI> and <HI>Daphne,</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Peneus,</HI> who was turned into a Bay-Tree, had a pro|per Scene in this place: for on the Banks of the River, Bay-trees grow plentifully unto this day.</P>
<P>There is an hand&s;ome Stone Bridge over this River, con&s;i&s;ting of Nine Arches; and peculiarly contrived with holes and pa&s;&s;age in the &s;olid parts between the Arches, to afford &s;ome pa&s;&s;age unto the water, when it is high; and hinder the bearing down of the Bridge, in high wa|ters, and great floods.</P>
<P>The City being full, many <HI>Turks</HI> had their Tents in the Fields, by the River &s;ide, and lower Grounds, which being of various colours, and not far from a large <HI>Mo&s;chea,</HI> and the City, afforded a plea&s;ant Pro|&s;pect. The Sails of their Tents were &s;o ordered, that they came not within a yard of the ground: &s;o that the Air might freely enter into

<P>The neare&s;t con&s;iderable Port unto <HI>Lari&s;&s;a,</HI> is that of <HI>Vollo,</HI> or old <HI>Paga&s;a,</HI> in the <HI>Sinus Pagaficus,</HI> or <HI>Demetriacus,</HI> or Gulf of <HI>Armiro:</HI> not far from whence &s;tood old <HI>Argos Pela&s;gicum;</HI> from which place the <HI>Argonauts</HI> fir&s;t &s;et &s;ail, in that famous Voyage for <HI>Colchos,</HI> by which way the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> received intelligence from <HI>Candia,</HI> and his <HI>A&s;ian</HI> and <HI>African</HI> Dominions.

<P>It was no hard matter to have a &s;ight of the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> at this place; for he rode out often, for his recreation of hunting and hawk|ing, with great number of Attendants, and Hunt&s;men, and Falconers, in their proper habits: and al&s;o went frequently to the great <HI>Mo&s;ched.</HI> I had a full view of him, as he came out of his Palace, to go unto his devotion. Before he came out, divers brave Hor&s;es richly capari&s;oned, were mounted by divers of his Attendants, nobly attired, and rode about the Court-yard; &s;o that he looking out of the window, made choice of which he liked be&s;t, and would then make u&s;e of.</P>
<P>At his fir&s;t appearance abroad, great acclamations were made, low bowings from all, both near and at a di&s;tance; the Streets were made clean, and a <HI>Jan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ary</HI> was placed at every corner, to provide, that there might be no hinderance in the way.

<P>The <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> was then under Thirty years of age, well &s;et, &s;ome|what &s;hort necked, inclining to fatne&s;s, his complexion fallow naturally, and much heightned by frequent riding about in tho&s;e hot Countrys. He hath a very &s;trong body, and healthful, and is a hard rider; hath a &s;tern look, and yet would &s;peak kindly unto per&s;ons, and encourage the people abroad to approach him, taking no delight in the cryes, and frights, and flying away of the Inhabitains at the &s;ight of him, or any of his Officers. The <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier</HI> carried divers Chri&s;tian Chyrurgeons with him to <HI>Candia,</HI> but I heard of no Phy&s;ician of Note about the <HI>Grand Seignior.</HI> The <HI>Sultan</HI> took great liking to a private <HI>Turki&s;h Prie&s;t,</HI> whom he met withal by chance in <HI>The&s;&s;aly,</HI> and made him his Chaplain; but the report was, that a famours Prie&s;t was coming to him.</P>

The <HI>Sultana</HI> was al&s;o at <HI>Lari&s;&s;a</HI> much beloved by the <HI>Sultan,</HI> by birth a <HI>Candiot,</HI> little of &s;tature, &s;omewhat marked with the Small Pox; &s;he was then with child, and was to go to lye-in at <HI>Mona&s;ter,</HI> a great and plea&s;ant Town in <HI>Macedonia;</HI> which being a place we were to pa&s;s, proved a great convenience unto us; for, in order to her better Jour|ney, the High-ways were plained, Hills made pa&s;&s;able, with Broad|ways and Bridges over Rivers, to the great labour of the Inhabitants; who notwith&s;tanding were not unready, to make a Bridge for &s;uch great Ones to pa&s;s out of their Country; for at the fir&s;t approach of the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> a great number of the <HI>Greeks</HI> for&s;ook their habitations, for fear of him and his Attendants, and left them unto the <HI>Turks;</HI> but were re|called again by his command.</P>
<P>The <HI>Grand Seignior</HI>'s Son was al&s;o with him there, about Six years old.</P>
<P>I went with <HI>O&s;man Chiaus</HI> to &s;ee the <HI>Chaymacham</HI>'s hou&s;e, but e&s;pecially to hear his Mu&s;ick, which was accounted the be&s;t in <HI>Turky.</HI> Where I heard the loude&s;t, yet not unplea&s;ant Mu&s;ick, I ever met with; ten men at once playing in an open high Room upon large Wind-In&s;truments, which they mi&s;s not to do at certain hours of the day.</P>
<P>In the Town I al&s;o heard &s;ome <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Songs, but e&s;pecially concern|ing <HI>Sabata Sevi,</HI> the famous <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Impo&s;tor, who had made a great noi&s;e in the World, and how <HI>Cu&s;&s;um Ba&s;ha</HI> &s;o handled him, that he was glad to turn <HI>Turk.</HI> This <HI>Cu&s;sum Ba&s;ha,</HI> is a per&s;on much honoured by the <HI>Turks,</HI> and cryed up for his great Skill and Practice in Phy&s;ick; an Art not much known among&s;t them.

Which, the Interpreter to the Re&s;ident told me, the <HI>Turks</HI> very much laugh|ed at; and that he was a <HI>Graecian</HI> born, and not a <HI>Wallachian.</HI> Of <HI>Paddre Ottomanno,</HI> who was thought to be the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI>'s Bro|ther, now a <HI>Dominican</HI> Frier, and whom I had &s;een at <HI>Turino,</HI> I could hear nothing.</P>
<P>There were many Thou&s;and Souldiers, and Hor&s;es, in and about the City, and Five thou&s;and Camels for the Service of the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> which being of different magnitudes, ages, and the bunches on their backs of different &s;hapes, and in &s;ome variety of colours, and treading &s;oft, and with little noi&s;e, afforded me a plea&s;ant &s;ight, when they were led by my lodging to watering at the River.</P>
<P>When we read, that <HI>Mardonius,</HI> the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> General of the great Ar|my<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sir</HI> Walter Rawleigh.</NOTE> of <HI>Xerxes,</HI> wintered in <HI>The&s;&s;aly;</HI> It is no &s;mall Te&s;timony of the fruitfulne&s;s of that Country; and though the number of men was here very great at this time, yet was there no want of provi&s;ion, but all very cheap; in a Victualling hou&s;e, I could Dine with roa&s;t and boy|led, and Sherbet, for the value of Six pence, and at an ea&s;ie rate could oblige <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> with a meal, which they would take very kindly.</P>
<P>The Place was al&s;o extraordinary populous: there being at that time &s;uch a mixed multitude in it. Yet was the City in very good order,

and quietne&s;s. An Officer with a Club in his Hand, accompanied with about twenty Per&s;ons, walking about the Streets, and puni&s;hing all Per&s;ons drunk, quarelling, clamorous, or acting any thing again&s;t good Manners.</P>
<P>When I was there in <HI>September</HI> 1669. it was very hot Weather, and many were &s;ick of Fevers and Agues; as they were at that time in mo&s;t Parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> and at my return into <HI>England</HI> I found many langui&s;hing under Quartan Agues, who had been taken therewith a|bout that time. They were then al&s;o in their Vintage, and we had the opportunity of ta&s;ting their Mu&s;t and New Wine; and the &s;tricter <HI>Turks,</HI> who would not be tempted with Wine, would be much deligh|ted, to take a little in the Mu&s;t.</P>
<P>During the hot &s;weating Sea&s;on, we went often to the Barber, who would hand&s;omely perform his Work, and much to our refre&s;hment; trimming every Man according to the Fa&s;hion of his Country.</P>
<P>The <HI>Greeks</HI> have a place, of the bredth of a Dollar, le&s;t bare upon the top of their Crowns; and then let the Hair grow round it the bredth of two Fingers, more or le&s;s; after which they &s;have all the re&s;t of their Head, and wear it bare.</P>
<P>The <HI>Croatian,</HI> hath one &s;ide of his Head &s;horn, and the other &s;ide is neither &s;horn nor cut, but the Hair is let to grow as long as it will. The <HI>Hungarian</HI> &s;haves his whole Head, except his Fore-top. The <HI>Polander,</HI> wears his Hair &s;hort cut, &s;o as it comes down to the middle of his Fore-head, and the middle of his Ear. The <HI>Turk</HI> &s;haves his whole Head, except a Lock upon his Crown. The <HI>Francks</HI> &s;have not their Heads, but wear their Hair long, as with us, only for the more amicable conver&s;e, and that nothing about them might be of|fen&s;ive to tho&s;e, whom they live among&s;t, they often tuck it up under their Caps. The <HI>Greek</HI> Prie&s;ts, al&s;o neither &s;have nor cut their Hair, but wear it as long as it will grow; and many of them have thick heads of Hair; but tho&s;e, that have lea&s;t, receive mo&s;t refre&s;hment here. The Party to be &s;haved, &s;its low; and the Barber has the better advan|tage, to &s;have much at one &s;troke, he lays on very much Soap, and holds his Ra&s;or as a Knife, and in a few &s;trokes fini&s;hes his Work. There is a Ve&s;&s;el of Water with a Cock hanging over their Heads, which the Barber opens as he plea&s;es, and lets fall the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Water on them.</P>
<P>In one of the&s;e Barbers &s;hops in the City of <HI>Lari&s;&s;a</HI> I &s;aw an ancient large Tomb of &s;tone of a <HI>Ja&s;pis</HI> green colour, a noble Monument, but ta|ken little notice of there, and the Barber had cau&s;ed a hole to be digged through the top &s;tone, and put Water into it, and made it to &s;erve him for a Ci&s;tern.</P>
<P>I was in &s;ome doubt, how we &s;hould be accommodated for the ex|change of our Ducats, Dollars, and other money we brought with us; but we found ready accommodation therein from Money|changers, who &s;it in the Market-place for &s;uch purpo&s;es, to change them into Medines, A&s;pers, and five &s;ols Pieces, whereof there was plenty in tho&s;e Parts.</P>
<P>The great trading Streets were covered, as in other great <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Towns; the Shops are &s;mall, but well furni&s;hed; wherein hang all Commodities, which may be had in a larger manner, if de&s;ired. The Shop-keeper &s;its like a Taylor in his Shop, and &s;o &s;ells his Commodi|ties

<P>Though I have been much plea&s;ed at the &s;ight of the fine Stables of Hor&s;es of many Princes in <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> as at that of the <HI>Louvre</HI> in <HI>Paris.</HI> The Vice-Roy's of <HI>Naples.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI>'s noble Stable at <HI>Dre&s;den,</HI> and Count <HI>Walle&s;teyne</HI>'s at <HI>Prague</HI> in the la&s;t of which each Hor&s;e hath a Marble Pillar by him, eats his Provender out of a Manger of poli&s;hed Marble upon a Pede&s;tal of the &s;ame, placed in a <HI>Nicchio,</HI> in which hangs al&s;o his rack of hammered Steel, and over his head on one &s;ide his Picture as big as the life. Yet tho&s;e gal|lant Hor&s;es, I beheld at <HI>Lari&s;&s;a</HI> were &s;urprizing unto me, cho&s;en from all parts of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Empire; which were &s;o richly equipped with Bridles and Saddles &s;et with precious Stones, and withal &s;o tender mouth|ed and tractable, that it was a great delight to behold them. I &s;aw &s;ome <HI>Tartarian</HI> Hor&s;es, which are of &s;ingular e&s;teem, for hardine&s;s, la&s;ting, and &s;wiftne&s;s, but un&s;ightly, and promi&s;e little, and when <HI>Cha Gagi Aga,</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador from the <HI>Cham</HI> of <HI>Tartary,</HI> pre&s;ented &s;ome of them to the Emperor of <HI>Germany,</HI> at fir&s;t &s;ight I thought them but a pi|tiful pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The <HI>Greek</HI> Merchants &s;ome of them learn the <HI>Italian</HI> Tongue, in order to their Commerce: which makes that Language of good u&s;e unto a Traveller in the&s;e parts, where <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Latine</HI> are in a manner u&s;ele&s;s.

<P>I was in <HI>The&s;&s;aly</HI> at a very dry &s;ea&s;on, and &s;ome con&s;iderable Rivers were low, and &s;mall ones dry, yet one I ob&s;erved about &s;even Miles on this &s;ide <HI>Tornovo,</HI> to flow plentifully from under a rocky Mountain; not in &s;mall &s;prings or &s;treams; but the whole body of the River came from under the Hill. The Country however in general was ve|ry hot and dry, and I could not but think, what a different face it now had, from that, in the time of <HI>Deucalion,</HI> King of <HI>The&s;saly;</HI> when that memorable deluge happened in this Country, which &s;ome affirm, to have la&s;ted a whole Winter; occa&s;ioned by &s;ome &s;topping of the River <HI>Peneus,</HI> and its current into the Sea; into which River mo&s;t of the others run, and &s;o an inundation mu&s;t follow in &s;uch a Country as <HI>The&s;&s;aly,</HI> which is plain, and encompa&s;&s;ed with Hills. And &s;ome al&s;o conceive, that in the fir&s;t times all this Country was under water, till an Earthquake divided the Mountains of <HI>O&s;&s;a</HI> and <HI>Olympus,</HI> and made a free pa&s;&s;age for <HI>Peneus,</HI> to pa&s;s by <HI>Tempe</HI> into the Sea. In <HI>Macedo|nia,</HI> between <HI>Comonava</HI> and <HI>Filurina,</HI> at a place called <HI>Ecci&s;&s;o Verbeni,</HI> where I &s;aw plentiful Springs of Mineral waters, I had al&s;o a Pro&s;pect of two great Lakes; one whereof the People have a Tradition, that it fir&s;t happened by taking great &s;tones out of the &s;ide of a Mountain; whereupon there i&s;&s;ued out &s;uch a flood of water, as to drown the Country about, and to cau&s;e a Lake.</P>
<P>As I travelled in <HI>Macedonia,</HI> the <HI>Chiaus</HI> told me, that within two days he would &s;how me <HI>French</HI> men, whereby he meant the Country People of <HI>The&s;&s;aly,</HI> from &s;ome likene&s;s of their Caps with &s;mall brims, to the little Hats lately in fa&s;hion.</P>

The <HI>The&s;&s;alians</HI> have been a warlike Nation, and are &s;till a &s;tout Peo|ple.

<P>The Country of <HI>The&s;&s;aly</HI> &s;eemed the more con&s;iderable to me, in re|gard that it hath formerly been the Seat of great Actions, and produ|ced many worthy Per&s;ons; and particularly, becau&s;e the famous <HI>Hip|pocrates,</HI> the Father of Phy&s;icians lived and practi&s;ed here, as may be collected from the Oration of his Son <HI>The&s;&s;alus,</HI> and the Narration of his Life by <HI>Soranus,</HI> annexed to his Works; wherein it is delivered That he lived in <HI>The&s;&s;aly,</HI> and was warned by a Dream to abide in that Coun|try.

<P>The <HI>The&s;&s;alians</HI> are an hand&s;om race of People, having black Hair, black Eyes, and their Faces of a fre&s;h and florid &s;anguine, much like our fre&s;h Complexions in <HI>England:</HI> &s;o that Strangers much admired the Women, and &s;poke often of the <HI>bel &s;angue de' Greci,</HI> or fair blood of the <HI>Graecians.</HI> The <HI>Macedonians,</HI> who live in hilly Countries, are of a coar&s;er Complexion: and the <HI>Moreans</HI> or <HI>Peloponne&s;ians,</HI> who live more South-ward, incline unto a &s;warthine&s;s.</P>
<P>They have always had the name of good Hor&s;e-men, and the Coun|try &s;till abounds in good Hor&s;es.

<P>The Country produces very large, fair, and delicious Figs, Water|melons, the large&s;t and mo&s;t plea&s;ant I have ta&s;ted; which were very refre&s;hing unto us; as al&s;o fair and delicate Pomegranates, Orainges, Limons and Citrons, Vines, which are low, like tho&s;e about <HI>Mont|pellier,</HI> and not &s;upported; but the Branches and Clu&s;ters great, and the Grapes as big as good Dama&s;ens, and of a delicious ta&s;te.

<P>In the We&s;tern Parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> in many Churches the Fonts are &s;tately, rai&s;ed high from the Ground, and to be a&s;cended unto by di|vers Steps; &s;ometimes covered with large Canopies, or with high Pa|vilions hand&s;omly carved and adorned. But in the <HI>Greek</HI> Churches
<PB N="44" REF="29">
the Font or Ba&s;on is generally made of plain Stone, and placed low upon the Floor of the Church; and this is more convenient for them, in their baptizing of Infants. For they put the Child into the Water, and are not contented with a meer &s;prinkling upon the Fore-head of it. But the Prie&s;t, after he hath ble&s;&s;ed the Water, and dipped a Cruci|&s;ix into it three times, he takes the naked Child by one Arm, and &s;ets it into the Font up to the Wa&s;t, and with his other Hand laves the Water thrice over its Head; and this hath been their Way of bapti|zing for many hundred Years. Nor could that otherwi&s;e have happen|ed, which is reported of the Emperor, <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the &s;ixth, <HI>Con&s;tanti|nus &s;extus, dictus Copronymus, quod Infans dum baptizaretur aquam &s;a|cram ventris &s;olutione macula&s;&s;et.</HI> The dipping of the naked Body in Water being apt to move it.

<P>The Fields about this Place are planted with <HI>Vines, Cotton</HI> and <HI>Se|&s;amum.</HI> The Emperors Re&s;ident <HI>Illu&s;tri&s;&s;imo Signore di Ca&s;a nova,</HI> was well accommodated here with a fair Hou&s;e, and had thirty <HI>Turks</HI> and Chri&s;tians in his Family, and two <HI>Janizaries</HI> attending at the Gate, good humored and fair conditioned Men, as could be wi&s;hed. The Re|&s;ident was a <HI>Milane&s;e</HI> by birth, a grave and &s;ober Per&s;on, &s;omewhat melancholy, much addicted to his Book and reading, but very civil and courteous. He dined and &s;upped alone by him&s;elf; his Secreta|ry, Interpreters, and others of his Family, had another Place of repa&s;t, and were always well provided, and &s;erved after the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> man|ner.</P>
<P>The Amba&s;&s;ador al&s;o of <HI>Ragu&s;a</HI> made choice of the &s;ame Town; and their followers often met each other, and many courteous &s;alutes pa&s;|&s;ed between them; but they were only by civil Me&s;&s;ages, for they ne|ver met, upon a <HI>punctilio,</HI> which kept them a&s;under; the <HI>Ragu&s;a</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador pretending a right to take the fir&s;t place, he being in the quality of an Amba&s;&s;ador, the other but of a Re&s;ident; although he were much de&s;pi&s;ed for it by the <HI>Germans,</HI> and his Ma&s;ters looked up|on, but as Gentlemen of the <HI>Sette Bandiere,</HI> or Per&s;ons that were and had been Subjects and Tributaries under &s;even Ma&s;ters, or Sove|reign Princes.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not forget <HI>Demetrius,</HI> a <HI>Greek</HI> Merchant of <HI>Tornovo,</HI> in whom I thought I beheld the Humor of the old <HI>Greeks,</HI> we were divers times entertained at his Hou&s;e with much genero&s;ity, and hearty free|dom. He de&s;ired us to enjoy his Hou&s;e freely, and to be merry after the Mode of our own Countries: and, as an e&s;pecial favour, brought his two Daughters to bid us welcome: and we took the liberty, after the Cu&s;tom of <HI>France, Holland</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> to &s;alute them; they were hand&s;omly attired, after the manner of their Country; their Hair brayded and hanging down their back; their Shooes or Slip|pers painted, their Nails coloured of a reddi&s;h colour with <HI>Cn&agrave;</HI> or <HI>Alcanna;</HI> the Leaves of which Plant, powdred and &s;teeped in Water and Wine, and layed a Night upon their Nails, leaves this Tincture, and is much u&s;ed in <HI>Turkey;</HI> where &s;ome delight al&s;o to colour tho Mains and Tails of their Hor&s;es. The <HI>Graecians</HI> of <HI>Scio</HI> al&s;o, who wear Gloves (it being a rare thing to &s;ee any here) do colour their Gloves al&s;o upon tho&s;e Parts which cover their Nails. <HI>Cn&agrave;</HI> is a great Commodity in the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Dominions, brought out of <HI>Arabia</HI> and

<HEAD>SOME OCCURRENCIES AND OBSERVATIONS IN THIS JOURNEY.</HEAD>
<P>IT is no unplea&s;ant &s;ight to behold a new Scene of the World, and unknown face of things, in Habits, Diet, Manners, Cu&s;toms and Language. A Man &s;eems to take leave of our World, when he hath pa&s;&s;ed a Days journey from <HI>Rab</HI> or <HI>Comorra:</HI> and, before he comes to <HI>Buda,</HI> &s;eems to enter upon a new Stage of the World, quite different from that of the&s;e We&s;tern Countries: for he then bids adieu to Hair on the Head, Bands, Cuffs, Hats, Gloves, Beds, Beer: and en|ters upon Habits, Manners and cour&s;e of life; which with no great va|riety, but under &s;ome conformity, extend unto <HI>China,</HI> and the utmo&s;t Parts of <HI>A&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>Though we were pretty well &s;ecured by Authority for &s;afe Travel, yet we were not without fear of the <HI>Hu&s;sars,</HI> till we came to <HI>E&s;&s;eck</HI> Bridge, over the River <HI>Dravus:</HI> for they are active Per&s;ons; and un|der&s;tanding the Language, will boldly range about for Booty, as far as that noted Pa&s;s; and, knowing all By-ways, will rob and &s;poil whom they meet, e&s;pecially the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Subjects.</P>
<P>Nor were we without fear al&s;o of <HI>Gyp&s;ies,</HI> who are &s;tout and bold, and &s;ome of them have been noted Robbers. There are many of them in <HI>Hungaria, Servia, Bulgaria, Macedonia;</HI> and &s;ome I &s;aw at <HI>Lari&s;&s;a,</HI> and other Parts of <HI>TheBaly.</HI> They are in mo&s;t Towns, and live by la|bour, and handy-craft Trades; many of them colour their Hands and Feet of a reddi&s;h colour, with <HI>Cn&agrave;,</HI> and think tho&s;e Parts &s;uffer le&s;s from the Cold thereby. Some <HI>Gyp&s;y</HI> Women colour the ends of their Hair al&s;o. Though they be remotely di&s;per&s;ed, yet they are thought to have had their beginning about <HI>Wallachia,</HI> and the adjoining Parts, many of them are conceived to be Spies unto the <HI>Turk.</HI> A little be|fore I came to <HI>Leopold&s;tadt,</HI> by <HI>Frei&s;tadt,</HI> a great drove of them appear|ed in tho&s;e Parts; which the People &s;u&s;pected to be Spies of the <HI>Vi&s;ier</HI> of <HI>Buda,</HI> to take notice of the State of tho&s;e Parts, and how that Fort proceeded.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="30">
Travelling from <HI>Belgrade</HI> into <HI>Servia,</HI> we were in &s;ome danger of being robbed: for we perceived three Hor&s;e-men to ride very fa&s;t af|ter us; and, when they had over-taken us, they rode about us, wav|ing their Lances, and di&s;charged their Pi&s;tols; but the <HI>Chiaus</HI> perceiv|ing them to be <HI>Spahies,</HI> &s;howed his Feather, and &s;aid to me, di&s;charge one of your Pi&s;tols at random, and let them know, we are not unarm|ed; at which they went off, and we &s;aw them no more.</P>
<P><HI>Caravan&s;ara's, Chan's,</HI> or Places of publick Lodging, built by Bene|factors, we liked not &s;o well as private Hou&s;es; and therefore, being but few in Company, &s;eldom lodged in them, for they are wide Rooms, and we mu&s;t provide for our &s;elves therein; and &s;ometimes they are dangerou&s;ly &s;eated, &s;o that it was not fit to adventure our &s;elves therein, for fear of being robbed; for though Robberies be &s;everely puni&s;hed, yet are they frequently committed; and <HI>Gyp&s;ies</HI> are well ver|&s;ed in that Trade; and therefore, in order to the &s;afety of Travellers, Drummers are appointed in dangerous Pa&s;&s;ages; and in <HI>Macedonia,</HI> in a narrow Pa&s;s, I &s;aw an old Man beating a Drum upon the ridge of a Hill; whereby we had notice, that the Pa&s;&s;age was clear and free from Thieves.</P>
<P>We had the advantage of good Accommodation for Travel, for par|ting from <HI>Comora,</HI> our Boat was towed by a <HI>Saick</HI> of twenty four Oars; <HI>Hungarians</HI> rowing upon one &s;ide, and <HI>Germans</HI> on the other; till we came to <HI>Motch,</HI> the Frontier Town, where we had a <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Convoy; who fa&s;tning our Boat to their <HI>Saick</HI> with eighteen Oars, rowed down the <HI>Danube,</HI> we carrying the Eagle on our Flag, and the <HI>Turks</HI> the double Sword and Half-moon, and pa&s;&s;ed by divers remark|able Places to <HI>Buda,</HI> from whence we had good Accommodation for Travel to <HI>Belgrade,</HI> by open Chariots, with two, three or four Hor&s;es on brea&s;t; which with great &s;peed conveyed us through that plea&s;ant plain Country, and from thence through <HI>Servia,</HI> and other Provinces, we were furni&s;hed with very good Hor&s;es, which would travel at a good rate twenty Miles in a Stage, and were very &s;ure of foot; where|of I had good experience, when in &s;ome Parts we travelled over great Hills, unequal and craggy Places, and over the bare Rocks. They are very free, and therefore the Owners of the Hor&s;es took acceptions at our Spurs, which are &s;eldom u&s;ed by them, and the <HI>Turks</HI> had none, but what we brought, and gave them. They are very tractable and tender mouthed; and when we mounted or alighted, would hand|&s;omly apply them&s;elves to &s;uch Places; and when we walked, &s;ome of them would follow us without leading. They have a lighter and le&s;|&s;er Shooe than our Hor&s;es; and when they have &s;hod one foot, they take up the foot again&s;t it, and &s;etting the other upon a Block of three inches high, they pare it.</P>
<P>They have very good Hor&s;es in mo&s;t of the&s;e Countrys, and very fleet, but they never dock them, but their Tails grow out at length, and &s;ometimes they hand&s;omly make them up: and in their Journeys they often alight from them, and &s;trongly pull at their Fore-top or forehead-lock, and think that doth much refre&s;h them, which the Strangers who travel here call <HI>Croatian</HI> Provender.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ba&s;sa</HI> of <HI>Teme&s;war</HI> pre&s;ented <HI>Ragotzi</HI> with a Hor&s;e, which <HI>Ra|gotzi</HI> &s;lighting cut off the Hor&s;e's Ears, Main and Tail, and &s;ent him
<PB N="48" REF="31">
back again. This perhaps would have been thought an Ornament to an Hor&s;e in <HI>England:</HI> but the <HI>Ba&s;sa</HI> took it as &s;uch an affront to his, that he never cea&s;ed from &s;tirring up the <HI>Sultan,</HI> and other Princes a|gain&s;t him, and never forgave the Injury, but by the help of the <HI>Turk, Tartar, Emperor, Poles</HI> and <HI>Ragotzi</HI>'s own Country-men al&s;o, he wrought at la&s;t his Ruine.</P>
<P>For their feeding, they make no high Mangers or Racks, to pull down thir Food; but, ob&s;erving the Rule of Nature, lay their Hay low before them, and almo&s;t even with the Ground; which in long neck|ed Animals, may be the mo&s;t commodious way, they are lodged hard, and often with little covering. At <HI>Lari&s;&s;a,</HI> where the Town was pe|&s;tered with Hor&s;es and Camels: the Yards of the Hou&s;es were full of them, and Places made at the bottom of the Wall for their Food.</P>
<P>In <HI>Caravan&s;ara's</HI> the Hor&s;es are tyed to a ringle, fa&s;tned unto the &s;ide of a long Place, a little elevated, upon which the Travellers take their re&s;t; and the Hay was laid a little below our feet, whereon the Hor&s;es feed.</P>
<P>They plow more with Oxen than Hor&s;es, and e&s;pecially with <HI>Buf|felo's;</HI> and have great variety of Ploughs and Carts; &s;ome whereof I could not but take notice of in <HI>Macedonia,</HI> made with Wheels, not con&s;i&s;ting of Spoaks, but of &s;olid Wood, in the whole piece; whether &s;o contrived for &s;trength, in tho&s;e rocky Countries, where they mu&s;t &s;trike and force upon &s;uch inequalities, I cannot tell.</P>
<P>We were furni&s;hed with &s;mall things to oblige the People where we pa&s;&s;ed: and in Hou&s;es where we entred, many would welcome the Emperor's Courier, and ask him what he had brought for them. We plea&s;ed them with Sci&s;&s;ors, Knives; and they would be content, if we gave a Glove to one, and the fellow to another. To the Women we gave &s;mall pieces of <HI>European</HI> Coines; and I was much thanked by a <HI>Bulgarian</HI> Woman, for a bright <HI>cinq &s;ols</HI> piece, which &s;he added to the dre&s;s of her Head, over her Fore-head, with other Coins &s;he had there before; &s;ome of them wearing Duckets of Gold, and Pearl, and Stones of value upon that Part, which make no unhand&s;om &s;how.</P>
<P>Being only careful to keep our &s;elves from Thieves, we expected no &s;uch trouble, as we found from Wolves and Dogs, in our Journey about the Mountains in <HI>Servia;</HI> and e&s;pecially in large Woods, we were continually alarmed by Wolves, e&s;pecially in the Night; when they &s;eldom cea&s;ed to howl in great numbers, and not far from us; &s;o that we were forced to be &s;olicitous in our Guard, and to keep clo&s;e together. And as the Wolves were trouble&s;ome, &s;o al&s;o the great number of Dogs in tho&s;e Parts were very offen&s;ive to us. As &s;oon as we came near any Town, or left it, they came out, running at us, barking and biting the Hor&s;es legs, and in Hou&s;es would be barking and &s;narling, &s;o that without a Cudgel it was not &s;afe going into the Yard. And it &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible, that the&s;e Towns &s;hould be &s;urprized by the mo&s;t &s;ilent Enemy, without having good notice thereof by Dogs: and &s;ure, they are kept to this intent. For as &s;oon as the Sun &s;ets they begin to bark and cea&s;e not till the Morning. The Town of St. <HI>Malo's</HI> in <HI>France</HI> is al&s;o guarded &s;omewhat after this manner, where they turn the Dogs out of the Town at Night, and are as &s;ecure there|by,
<PB N="49" REF="31">
as if they had an army of Watchmen to guard them. Some &s;uch trouble from Dogs I remembred, that I had met with at the &s;trong Town of <HI>Komara,</HI> when I came into the Town about Midnight, which was &s;o full of Dogs fiercely barking and running upon us, that to &s;ave our &s;elves, we were fain to take &s;helter in the <HI>Corps de guard,</HI> till a lodg|ing was provided for us.</P>
<P>I could not but pity the poor Chri&s;tians, &s;eeing under what fear they lived in tho&s;e Parts; when I ob&s;erved them to make a way, as &s;oon as they perceived us coming towards them. In <HI>Macedonia</HI> the Men and Women would betake them&s;elves into the Woods to avoid us; and we took the pains &s;ometimes to ride after them, to undeceive them of their folly and needle&s;s Frights.</P>
<P>But that which moved me mo&s;t, was the pitiful Spectacle of Cap|tives and Slaves, which are often met with in tho&s;e Countries; toge|ther with the variety of their hard Fates and Accounts, how they fell into that Condition; &s;ome by Treachery, &s;ome by Chance of War; others by Plagiary and Man-&s;tealing <HI>Tartars,</HI> who plentifully furni&s;h the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Dominion; &s;ome fixed to one Ma&s;ter, others having been &s;old unto many, and at di&s;tant Places. But their Condition is mo&s;t de&s;perate who are Slaves to the Court, and belong to the <HI>Grand Sei|ignior:</HI> for they are never to be redeemed. Of which kind I met with one at <HI>Egribugia</HI> in <HI>Macedonia,</HI> attending at the po&s;t-hou&s;e; who though he had no hard Office, yet was extremely dejected upon this misfortune of Non-redemption.</P>
<P>In <HI>The&s;&s;aly</HI> al&s;o I met with one <HI>Sigi&s;mund,</HI> who had been a Slave to &s;everal Per&s;ons, and in &s;everal Countries. He was an <HI>Hungarian,</HI> born at <HI>Gran,</HI> and taken at the Battle of <HI>Barachan,</HI> under Count <HI>Forchatz,</HI> in the la&s;t Wars; fir&s;t &s;erved a <HI>Turk,</HI> then &s;old to a <HI>Jew,</HI> who proved a hard Ma&s;ter, then to an <HI>Armenian;</HI> under whom he &s;o well acquitted him&s;elf, that his Ma&s;ter gave him his freedom, and he made a &s;hift to come to <HI>Lari&s;&s;a,</HI> where the Emperor's Re&s;ident entertained him. I was very much plea&s;ed with his Conver&s;ation, being a worthy, hone&s;t and good natured Man; and had maintained his Chri&s;tianity in his &s;everal Fortunes. He &s;poke <HI>Hungarian, Sclavonian, Turki&s;h, Armenian</HI> and <HI>La|tin:</HI> &s;hew'd me the Draughts of many Mona&s;teries, Abbies, <HI>Mo&s;chea's,</HI> and con&s;iderable Buildings in <HI>Armenia, Per&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Turkey:</HI> and I hope by this time he is in his own Country.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks,</HI> who are well acquainted with the Captives of &s;everal Na|tions, make ob&s;ervations of them: &s;o they &s;ay, a <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> is be&s;t for the Oar, a <HI>Georgian</HI> makes a good Courtier, and an <HI>Albanian,</HI> a good Coun|&s;ellor. A <HI>Turk</HI> in our company, ob&s;erving a <HI>Georgian</HI> Captive much dejected at his Condition, encouraged him, and bid him be of good cheer; telling him he might come to be a great Man, and one of the be&s;t in <HI>Turky.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t time I went to have a &s;ight of the <HI>Grand Seignior, O&s;mund Chiaus</HI> made no great ha&s;te forward, and when I asked him the rea&s;on, he replied, I take no great plea&s;ure to be too near him: and afterwards when he talked of &s;ome <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's,</HI> who had been &s;trangled, and I added, that in this re&s;pect he lived more happily than any <HI>Ba&s;sa:</HI> he &s;aid, &s;uch things mu&s;t be patiently put up, all our Lives are in the <HI>Sultan's</HI> hands: in your petty Kingdoms and States, Men are Tryed and Convi|cted,
<PB N="50" REF="32">
but our great Empire cannot be &s;o maintained, and if the <HI>Sultan</HI> &s;hould now &s;end for my Head I mu&s;t be content to lay it down pati|ently, not asking wherefore: and I remember his Words were that in this Country we mu&s;t have, <HI>patienza fin a perder la te&s;ta, e poi pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ien|za,</HI> patience even to the lo&s;s of our Heads, and patience after that.</P>
<P>We had frequent Memento's of Mortality, by Graves and Sepul|chres, as we pa&s;&s;ed; e&s;pecially near <HI>Belgrade.</HI> For the <HI>Turks</HI> are com|monly buried by the High-ways: yet their Tombs are not ordinarily &s;plendid, con&s;i&s;ting only of a Stone erected at the Head and at the Feet: yet &s;ome &s;et up Stones of two, three or four yards high. Some have a Turbant carved upon the Stone, at the Head; and others &s;et up two Pillars of Stone; &s;ome proceed farther, and rai&s;e the Sepulchres, as with us, and afterwards place two Pillars upon them, one at the Head, and another at the Feet. At <HI>Scopia</HI> I &s;aw fair ones, after this manner, and two Sepulchres in one of them: but the be&s;t way I ob&s;erved in the&s;e Parts, is by building a Pavillion &s;up|ported by four Pillars. As we travelled to the South from <HI>Jagodna</HI> in <HI>Servia,</HI> I &s;aw upon the &s;ide of a Hill, a large <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Tomb, about four yards long, and a &s;quare place covered by it, which the <HI>Chiaus</HI> told me was the Tomb of one of their Saints, and accordingly perform|ed his Devotions at it, and at other Places: on Thur&s;day Nights and Friday's, I ob&s;erved the Women to vi&s;it the Sepulchres, and pay their Devotions at the Tombs of their dead Friends.</P>
<P>This Gigantick Saint that lay buried here, was certainly a fit Man in his time to wield the holy Club, with which the <HI>Turk</HI> does propo|gate his Religion and Dominion, and if he were as long as his Tomb, he was as formidable a Per&s;on as any of the <HI>Patagonian</HI> Gyants painted upon the Southern Part of divers Maps of <HI>America</HI> with long Arrows in their Throats. I mu&s;t confe&s;s it &s;eems &s;trange to me that the Sta|ture of Man &s;hould be extended to that height. Mr. <HI>Wood,</HI> an ingeni|ous Per&s;on, who hath made very fair and accurate Maps of the <HI>Streights</HI> of <HI>Magellan,</HI> the I&s;lands therein, and the Coa&s;t from the River of <HI>Plate</HI> to <HI>Baldivia,</HI> in the South-&s;ea, told me that he had &s;een divers Graves in the Southern Parts of <HI>America</HI> near four yards long, which &s;urpri|zed him the more, becau&s;e he had never &s;een any <HI>American</HI> that was two yards high, and therefore he opened one of the&s;e long Sepulchres from one end to the other, and found in it a Man and a Woman, &s;o placed, that the Womans head lay at the Mans feet, and &s;o might rea|&s;onably require a Tomb of near that length.</P>
<P>But to return into the rode for our diver&s;ion, we &s;ometimes met with <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Fairs, which are ordinarily kept in &s;ome large ground, enclo&s;ed and divided into Streets and Pa&s;&s;es, according to the variety of Commodities to be &s;old, where a Man may recreate him&s;elf with multiplicity of Fripperies, and things different from tho&s;e of our Parts, and cannot want variety of Mu&s;ick; which, though but mean, proved &s;ome diver&s;ion unto us. The fir&s;t Fair we met with, was at <HI>Le&s;coa</HI> or <HI>Le&s;covia,</HI> upon the River <HI>Liperizza</HI> in <HI>Servia.</HI></P>
<P>It was no &s;mall comfort to us, to find the Country &s;o free from the Plague, which we only met with at <HI>Pre&s;tina,</HI> a large Town, on part of the Plains of <HI>Co&s;&s;ova,</HI> when we came into that Place, we were enter|tained in a very good Hou&s;e, and brought into a large Room, well ac|commodated

The <HI>Chiaus,</HI> after the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Humor, made nothing of it; but &s;ome others were not &s;o contented; and there|fore we removed and travelled in the Night, till we came to a <HI>Gyp|&s;ie's</HI> Hou&s;e among&s;t the Hills, where we were well accommoda|ted.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> were much plea&s;ed to &s;ee me write; when I came into a|ny Hou&s;e, I pulled out my Paper-book to &s;et down what I ob&s;erved; which when they perceived, they would come about me, taking no|tice of the Paper, and binding of the Book, wondring to &s;ee me write &s;o fa&s;t, and with &s;uch a Pen, which was made of a Goo&s;e Quill, they u&s;ually writing with a hard Reed, cut like our Pens. Many carry about them an hand&s;ome bra&s;s Ink-horn, which they hang by their &s;ides; their Ink is good, Paper &s;mooth and poli&s;hed; whereon they will write very fairly, as I have to &s;how in the <HI>Sultan</HI>'s Pa&s;s, which I brought home with me.</P>
<P>When I found occa&s;ion, I u&s;ed to look upon &s;ome Maps, which I carried with me: whereat <HI>O&s;man Chiaus</HI> &s;miled, &s;aying, there is no de|pending upon Maps; they &s;et down only great Towns, and often fal&s;e|ly. <HI>Chiau&s;es</HI> are able to make the be&s;t Maps, who pa&s;s their Days in travelling Countries; and take notice of all Places&punc; and know their <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Names; and in many particulars I found &s;ome truth in his Words; for the Maps of <HI>Hungary</HI> are not exact; tho&s;e of <HI>Servia, Bul|garia, Macedonia</HI> and <HI>The&s;&s;aly</HI> very imperfect.

<P>I took great plea&s;ure to conver&s;e with <HI>Chiau&s;es,</HI> e&s;pecially if they were of any years; for they &s;peak divers Languages, and have &s;een much of the World; are commonly good Company, and able to give account of many things. <HI>O&s;man Chi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">us,</HI> who travelled with us, was a|bout fifty years of Age, &s;pake <HI>Turki&s;h, Sclavonian</HI> and <HI>Italian:</HI> a &s;tout and faithful hone&s;t Per&s;on, very cleanly and neat: he told me he had travelled the greate&s;t part of <HI>Turky,</HI> and growing old &s;eated him&s;elf in <HI>Buda,</HI> as a <HI>Chiaus</HI> to the <HI>Vi&s;ier;</HI> which place plea&s;ed him better than any in <HI>Turky:</HI> he took a civil farewel of me at <HI>Buda,</HI> bringing me out of the Gates, and with many a <HI>Dios</HI> wi&s;hed me a happy return into my Country; and indeed, in all my Journey I met with fair carriage, and civil u&s;age; when I came into any Room where the <HI>Turks</HI> were &s;itting&punc; they would &s;alute me, and touching my hand, require me to
<PB N="52" REF="33">
&s;it down with them, then offer me <HI>Coffee,</HI> and &s;ometimes <HI>Tabaco,</HI> and at Meals invite me to eat heartily; only in &s;ome places, the Boys, and meaner &s;ort of People would call me <HI>Sa&s;htlu gaur,</HI> or haired Infidel. And a <HI>Jew</HI> at <HI>Lari&s;&s;a,</HI> whom I had employed to buy &s;ome little things for me; and I &s;aying, they were too dear, gave me &s;ome ill Language, which &s;o di&s;plea&s;ed &s;ome that were by, that if the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> had not been in per&s;on in the Town, they would have taught him other manners.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> took much Tabaco in the Countries which I pa&s;&s;ed, and many carried little bags thereof by their &s;ides, which they take in pipes of an ell long, made of an hard reed, and an earthen head at the end, laying one end on the ground, and holding the other in their mouthes. I did &s;eldom take any; but to comply with their kindne&s;s, I would not refu&s;e it; and by rea&s;on of the length of the pipe, it was cool, and le&s;s di&s;turbing; they take it al&s;o often in &s;nuff. <HI>Seignior Gabriel,</HI> the Empe|ror's Courier would tell them many &s;tories; and while he was &s;peaking, they would come about him, and li&s;ten very attentively: and he would pull out his &s;nuff-box, and put &s;nuff-powder into their no&s;es, which they would take very kindly. They would be always gazing upon the Emperor's Armes cut in a Stone, which he wore upon his brea&s;t; whereupon he would take occa&s;ion to magnifie the Emperor, de&s;cribe the multitude of Provinces &s;ubject unto him; and any thing that might confer unto his honour, whereof they would take great notice.</P>
<P>I liked well the neatne&s;s and cleanline&s;s of the <HI>Turks,</HI> which we con|ver&s;ed with, and their wa&s;hing of their feet, hands, and faces, though they had &s;ome purifying conceit thereof; while we travelled, the <HI>Chiaus,</HI> at the fight of a Spring, or clear water, would often alight, and wa&s;h him&s;elf; and every morning was very curious in winding up his Turbant, and combing of his beard; and would ask me, whe|ther it were well done. When they go to the hou&s;e of office, they carry a pitcher of water with them; they affect privacy when they make water; which they perform, re&s;ting upon one knee, and &s;tretching out the other leg. Walking in <HI>Lari&s;&s;a</HI> with the <HI>Chiaus,</HI> the Streets being narrow, and full of people, and remembring the &s;ad fate of <HI>Vincent le Blanc,</HI> who lo&s;t his liberty, be&s;ides other misfortunes, for pi&s;&s;ing over a <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Saints head, who lay interred in a place, he little &s;u&s;pected; I asked him, where I might make water without of|fence, who an&s;wered me grumblingly at fir&s;t, but afterwards directed me to a place, and &s;tood at a little di&s;tance, to &s;ecure me from any affront. And at another time while I travelled in an open <HI>Cale&s;che</HI> or Chariot by Moon-light, I made water over one &s;ide thereof, to avoid being trouble&s;ome to the re&s;t in ingaging them to &s;tay for me till I alighted and went a&s;ide or retard their journey in the night; but one who layed down by my feet took notice of it to me with a great deal of regret, and and though out of the re&s;pect he profe&s;&s;ed to bear me, he was re&s;olved not to divulge it. Yet he wondered I would venture the lo&s;s of my credit in &s;uch a matter.</P>
<P>Some experience we had in our return of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Ju&s;tice, at <HI>E|gribugia,</HI> in <HI>Macedonia;</HI> for travelling from <HI>Sariggiole</HI> over high Rocks, we met with a <HI>Turki&s;h Aga</HI> before our arrival; who, having a nume|rous train, had taken up all the Hor&s;es at <HI>Egribugia;</HI> &s;o that we could not be readily &s;upplied; and therefore intended to ride our Hor&s;es

<P>The <HI>Cadih</HI> therefore con&s;idering of the bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;itting cro&s;s|legged upon his Carpet, and leaning his elbow upon four or five Folio Books, which he had by him; commanded his Servants to fill every one a di&s;h of <HI>Coffee.</HI> The <HI>Chiaus,</HI> in our defence, urged, that we had bu&s;ine&s;s of concern; that we had the <HI>Chaymacham</HI>'s Letters; and were employed from the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> to the Emperor of <HI>Germany;</HI> that he him&s;elf was a <HI>Chiaus</HI> to the <HI>Vi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">er</HI> of <HI>Buda,</HI> whither he was to conduct us, and that no man could or ought to &s;top him; whereupon the <HI>Ca|dih</HI> &s;aid, the <HI>Chiaus</HI> mu&s;t not be hindred in his journey, nor the Po&s;t-ma&s;ter be uncon&s;idered; and &s;o pre&s;ently called for the Po&s;t-ma&s;ters Book, and with his pen, made of a reed, &s;et down a <HI>Sultanine</HI> to be al|lowed him in his accounts to the <HI>Tefterdar,</HI> and bade us good morrow, and wi&s;hed us a good journey.</P>
<P>In the <HI>European Turki&s;h</HI> Dominions, which I pa&s;&s;ed, I could not but take notice of the great number of Chri&s;tians; for, excepting great Ci|ties, or where the <HI>Souldiery</HI> re&s;ide, they are generally all Chri&s;tians; whereof the great body is of the <HI>Greek</HI> Church, who live patiently un|der the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> toleration. If there &s;hould happen any con&s;iderable commotion among the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> powers; it is highly probable, they would &s;it &s;till, and be little active; and if any Forces of the <HI>Latine</HI> Church &s;hould attempt the Conque&s;ts of the&s;e parts, in all probability they would find very little a&s;&s;i&s;tance from them, and I fear they would rather adhere unto their <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>Though <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> thought it a point of wi&s;dom, to put &s;ome limit unto the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, yet I do not find the <HI>Turks</HI> are of his judg|ment, but &s;till endeavour to enlarge their Dominions, and when I con&s;i|der that people, their hardy education, &s;ober cour&s;e of life, and obe|dience to their Superiors; that no <HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI> can ea&s;ily intend a revolt, but &s;ome others will di&s;cover him, in hope to obtain his place, or &s;ome great preferment; and that they &s;o punctually ob&s;erve the duty of their Charges; I am apt to think, or fear, if he, who puts bounds to the Sea, and &s;aith hither thou &s;halt come and no further, doth not, out of his great mer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">y, put a &s;top to their further incur&s;ions, they may pro|bably obtain and con&s;erve a far larger Empire, and even all <HI>Europe,</HI> un|to the We&s;tern Ocean.</P>

There is a Tower in the middle, four Ba&s;tions and many good pieces of Cannon.

<HI>March</HI> the 21. <HI>Graff Souches</HI> &s;ent us <HI>German</HI> Mu&s;queteers to convoy us through the Contribution Country, and defend us in our travels; we pa&s;&s;ed by <HI>Ripnich,</HI> and a Ca&s;tle at <HI>Docatzi,</HI> belonging to Baron <HI>Berrini,</HI> and came at night to <HI>Topolchan</HI> upon the River <HI>Nitra,</HI> where the Town with the Church were burnt in the la&s;t war, and had not well recover|ed it &s;elf again.

We pa&s;&s;ed the River <HI>Gran</HI> early in the Morning, and came among the Hills to <HI>Hodrytz,</HI> by which Town runs a &s;wift &s;tream very &s;ervi|ceable to them, which helps to move their Engines employed in the pounding, wa&s;hing and melting of the Silver-ore. We travelled over a Mountain called <HI>Hell,</HI> and came to <HI>Schemnitz,</HI> the greate&s;t of the Mine-towns in <HI>Hungary:</HI> and where great quantity of Silver-ore is eve|ry day digged. The Town is well built, hath three fair Churches in it, the greate&s;t part of the Inhabitants are Lutherans. There are al&s;o three Ca&s;tles here; the old Ca&s;tle in the Town, where there is Wind-Mu&s;ick at &s;ix every morning, and at twelve, and at &s;ix at night. 2. The New-Ca&s;tle, built by a Lady, who removed the Gibbet from this Hill, and left a fair building in lieu of it. The third is on a high peak, where there is a continual watch kept to di&s;cover the approach of the <HI>Turks,</HI> who immediately give notice of it by the &s;hooting off a Culve|rin. The Streets lie up and down Hill, the Country hereabouts being all very uneven.</P>
<P>There are very many Mines here, and many adventurers are induced to try their fortunes by the good &s;ucce&s;s &s;o many have had: for if they find a Vein of Ore in any rea&s;onable time, before they have quite &s;pent their Stocks in digging, they may probably expect great profit.</P>
<P>The&s;e Mines among&s;t others are very remarkable; the <HI>Wind&s;chacht-Mine,</HI> the <HI>Trinity,</HI> that of St. <HI>Benedict,</HI> St. <HI>John, Matthias,</HI> and one called the three <HI>Kings;</HI> but the chiefe&s;t and mo&s;t wrought are tho&s;e of <HI>Wind&s;chacht</HI> and <HI>Trinity. Trinity-Mine</HI>
is &s;eventy fathoms deep, built and kept open with under-work at a great expence, much of this Mine being in an earthy &s;oil. The Ore of it is much e&s;teemed, and is commonly of a black colour covered with a white Earth or Clay; &s;o that the &s;treams where they work it, become milky and whiti&s;h, and is that &s;ub&s;tance I &s;uppo&s;e which is called <HI>Lac Lunae,</HI> or the Milk of the Moon or Silver. Divers Veins in this Mine lie North, and other rich Veins run to the North-Ea&s;t. When two Veins cro&s;s one another they e&s;teem it fortunate; &s;o that all Veins of Ore keep not the &s;ame point even in the &s;ame Mine, which would be an help to di&s;cover them; but they have no certain way to know either which way they run, or where they are, till by indu&s;trious per&s;evering in the labour of the Mines they are at la&s;t found out. They u&s;e not the <HI>Virgula divina,</HI> or forked Hazel-&s;tick to direct them, having no opinion of it (as I ob&s;erved they had at the Silver Mine at <HI>Friburg</HI> in <HI>Mi&s;nia,</HI> where I al&s;o learned the u&s;e thereof) but dig alwayes as the Adventurers de&s;ire. They &s;hew'd me one place, which they had digged &s;treight on &s;ix years, when the Ore was but two fathoms di&s;tant from the place where they fir&s;t began:
<PB N="58" REF="38">
and in another place they digged twelve years outright, and a t la&s;t found a Vein which in a &s;hort time paid their charges. I was in many parts of this Mine, and went &s;o far, that at length I pa&s;&s;ed quite under a Hill, and came out on the other &s;ide.</P>
<P>In <HI>Wind&s;chacht-Mine</HI> wherein I al&s;o de&s;cended as far as the water would then permit me, de&s;cending thrice almo&s;t perpendicularly about three hundred large &s;teps or &s;tairs of a Ladder. I ob&s;erved a large Wheel deep in the Earth, of twelve yards Diameter; turned about by the fall of &s;ubterraneous Waters. This Wheel moves Engines which pump out the water from the bottom of the Mine, up to the cavity wherein this Wheel is placed. The water which moves this Wheel falls no lower into the Mine, but pa&s;&s;es away through a <HI>Cumculus</HI> made on purpo&s;e, through which both this and the other water pump|ed from the deepe&s;t parts of the Mine, do run out together at the foot of an Hill. Be&s;ides this Wheel there is another above ground which lies Horizontally, drawn about continually by twelve Hor&s;es, which &s;erves al&s;o to pump out much of the water of this Mine; about all the Works whereof, I was informed that there were no le&s;s than two thou|&s;and men employed.</P>
<P>In &s;ome places of the Mine it is very cold, and in others &s;o hot, that to refre&s;h my &s;elf I was con&s;trained to go with my brea&s;t naked; al|though I had only linen Cloths on. Where they work it is always hot, &s;o that they labour naked for eight hours if they are able, and then re&s;t eight hours more.</P>
<P>In this Mine they &s;hewed me a place where five men and a Per&s;on of quality were de&s;troyed by a Damp, for which rea&s;on they have now placed a Tube there, the like they place over all doors, and over all ways where they dig right on for a great &s;pace, and have no pa&s;&s;age through; whereby the air is let in, let out, or carried round, and the Miners under-ground ventilated with it.</P>
<P>The blacki&s;h Ore is e&s;teemed the be&s;t; much of it hath a mixture of a &s;hining yellow &s;ub&s;tance or <HI>Marcha&s;ite,</HI> which if it be not in too great a quantity is not unwelcome, by rea&s;on that it di&s;po&s;es the Ore to fluidity, or renders it more ea&s;ie to be melted; but if it be in too great a proportion, they are of opinion, that it preys upon the Silver in the Mine; and in the Furnace carries it away while it melts, by over-volatilizing it; and therefore they term it a Robber, as a &s;ub&s;tance which &s;poyls and takes away the richne&s;s of the Ore.</P>
<P>There is often found a red &s;ub&s;tance which grows to the Ore called <HI>Cinnabar</HI> of Silver, which being grinded with Oyl makes a Vermilion equal to, if not &s;urpa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Cinnabar</HI> made by &s;ublimation.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o found in the&s;e Mines, <HI>Cry&s;tals, Amethy&s;ts,</HI> and <HI>Ame|thy&s;tine</HI> mixtures in the cle&s;ts of the Rocks, and &s;ometimes nigh or joyned to the Ore; as al&s;o Vitriol naturally cry&s;talliz'd in the Earth in divers of the&s;e Mines; and particularly in a Mine in <HI>Paradi&s;e Hill;</HI> which then belonged to Mr. <HI>Jacobus Schwiboda,</HI> an Apothecary, at who&s;e Hou&s;e I lodged, and who pre&s;ented me with many curious Mine|rals.</P>
<P>And as there is great variety in the Silver-Ore, as to its mixtures with <HI>Earth, Stones, Marcha&s;ite, Cinnabar, Vitriol,</HI> &amp;c. So al&s;o in its richne&s;s; &s;ome holding a great proportion of Silver in re&s;pect of others. An hun|dred pound weight of Ore &s;ometimes yields but half an ounce or an
<PB N="59" REF="38">
of Silver; &s;ometimes two ounces, three, four, five, and unto twenty ounces; what is richer is very rare, yet &s;ome hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">een found to hold half Silver, and I have &s;een of it &s;o rich, as to be cut with a knife.</P>
<P>A Specimen of each &s;ort of Ore which they dig out of the Mines is carried upon its fir&s;t being di&s;covered to an Officer called the <HI>Probie|rer,</HI> who is to prove and judge of its richne&s;s; which he doth in this manner. Of all &s;orts of Ores he takes the &s;ame quantity, the Ores being fir&s;t dryed, burned, and pounded, he gives an equal proportion of lead to all, melts and purifies them, and then by exact Scales takes notice of the proportion between the Ore and Metal contained in it, and reports it to tho&s;e employed in the great melting Furnaces; who accordingly add or dimini&s;h the quantities of tho&s;e &s;ub&s;tances which are to be mixed with the Ores to melt them in the melting Furnace; as for example, to an hundred centen or ten thou&s;and pound weight of Silver-Ore, which holds above two ounces and an half of Silver in an hundred pounds weight, they add forty centen of <HI>Leich,</HI> which is Ore pounded and wa&s;hed; two hundred centen of Iron-Stone, which is not Iron-Ore, but a Stone found in tho&s;e Hills, of which the liver colour|ed is the be&s;t. A q antity of <HI>Kis,</HI> or a &s;ort of <HI>Pyrites,</HI> according as the Ore is mixed with <HI>Marcha&s;ite,</HI> and of <HI>Slacken</HI> as much as they plea&s;e. This la&s;t is the &s;cum or cake taken off from the top of the Pan into which the Metals run, and is a &s;ub&s;tance made out of the former men|tioned, by fu&s;ion.</P>
<P>What&s;oever is melted in the melting Furnace, is let out through an hole at the bottom thereof into the pan, which is placed in the Earth before it; and thus expo&s;ed, it immediately acquires an hard &s;cum, dro&s;s, loaf or cake, which being continually taken away, the Metal remain|ing becomes purer; to which is added lead which carrieth all the Sil|ver down to the bottom with it, and after &s;ome time the melted Metal is taken out; then being again melted in the driving <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">urnace, the lead or what el&s;e remains mixt with the Silver is driven off by the blowing of two great bellows; and runs over from the melted Silver in form of <HI>Litharge.</HI> That which fir&s;t comes over, is the white and that which comes la&s;t, being longer in the fire, is the red, not that it is Litharge of Gold, both being driven off from the &s;ame Metal.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the <HI>Schemnitz</HI> Silver-Ore holds &s;ome Gold which they &s;epa|rate by melting the Silver, then granulating it, and afterwards by di&s;|&s;olving it in <HI>Aqua fortis</HI> made out of a peculiar Vitriol prepared at <HI>Chremnitz,</HI> whereby the Gold is left at the bottom and is afterwards melted; the <HI>Aqua fortis</HI> is di&s;tilled from the Silver, and &s;erves again for u&s;e. But it would be too tedious to de&s;cribe all the works of the&s;e Mines which do well de&s;erve as accurate De&s;criptions as tho&s;e of <HI>Mi&s;|nia,</HI> and other parts, of which <HI>Agricola</HI> hath written largely, and very well in his Books <HI>De re Metallica &amp; de fo&s;&s;ilibus. Lenys</HI> al&s;o of Mineral works is e&s;teemed, and <HI>Lazarus Erker</HI> hath hand&s;omely de&s;cribed the principal Ores and Mineral bodies. But certainly there are few places in the World to be compared with this, where Art and Nature &s;trive to &s;how their utmo&s;t force and riches.</P>
<P>They work in this Country much after the manner they did in the Emperour <HI>Rudolphus</HI> his time; who was a great undertaker and en|courager of Mine-works; but, many of their In&s;truments and Engines are much improved.</P>

Notwith&s;tanding the great quantity of Silver made every week at <HI>Schemnitz</HI> and carried away in Carts, I found &s;ome difficulty to pro|cure the lea&s;t piece there, and &s;carce any one in the Town could fur|ni&s;h me with any that was pure, for the Money of the Country is mix|ed with above half Copper; and being de&s;irous to &s;ee what alteration divers of tho&s;e Mineral-waters in that Country, would make upon Metals, for want of other Silver, I was forced to make u&s;e of &s;ilver Cro&s;&s;es, Crucifixes and Medals, which I borrowed.</P>
<P>Near unto <HI>Schemnitz,</HI> where old <HI>Schemnitz</HI> &s;tood, is an high Perpen|dicular Rock, part of which from the bottom to the top is naturally tinctured with &s;hining fair blue, &s;ome green, and &s;pots of yellow in it. At fir&s;t &s;ight I was much &s;urprized with the beauty of it, and could fan|&s;y nothing like it, but a whole Rock of poli&s;hed <HI>Lapis Lazuli:</HI> and I have heard from a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> who lived long in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> that there is al&s;o a Rock like this nigh to the Silver Mines in <HI>Peru.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Gla&s;s-Hitten,</HI> an <HI>Hungarian</HI> mile, or about &s;even <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> miles from <HI>Schemnitz,</HI> there was formerly a rich Gold Mine, but it is lo&s;t, no man knowing where the entrance was &s;ince the time that <HI>Beihlem Gabor</HI> Prnice of <HI>Tran&s;ylvania</HI> over-ran that Country, and the Inhabi|tants fled away. The Owner notwith&s;tanding left &s;ome marks and di|rections whereby they might di&s;cover it, with the Figures of his In|&s;truments upon the Barks of Trees; which In&s;truments they have already found by digging in the Earth, and thus much is intimated to them, that where they find a Stone, on which a Face is carved, they are at it, and are onely to remove part of a Rock with which the Owner &s;topped up the Mine.</P>
<P>This place is much frequented by rea&s;on of its natural hot Baths, of which there are five very convenient, with hand&s;ome de&s;cents into them, and covered over with large high Roots. The Springs are ve|ry clear, the Sediment is red and green, the wood and &s;eats of the Baths under water are incru&s;tated with a &s;tony &s;ub&s;tance, and Silver is gil|ded by being left in them: But the mo&s;t remarkable of the&s;e Baths, is that which is called the &s;weating Bath, who&s;e hot Springs drain through an Hill, and fall into a Bath built to receive them; at one end of which by a&s;cending I went into a Cave which is made a noble Stove by the heat of the&s;e <HI>Thermae,</HI> and &s;o ordered with Seats, that every one who &s;its in it, either by choo&s;ing an higher or a lower &s;eat, may regulate his &s;weating, or enjoy what degree of heat he de&s;ires. This Cave, as al&s;o the &s;ides of the Bath are covered by the continual dropping of tho&s;e hot Springs, with a red, white, and green &s;ub&s;tance, very fair and plea&s;ing to the eye.</P>
<P>Bathing my &s;elf in the large&s;t of the&s;e Baths when there were a great many Men and Women in it; an active man to divert the Company, had privately conveyed him&s;elf to the top of the Hou&s;e which covered the Bath, and on a &s;uddain ca&s;t him&s;elf down into the water, and by taking hold upon the bottom of the Seats kept him&s;elf under water for &s;ome time; afterwards a Serpent coming into the Bath through a channel which conveyed the water into it, many of the women were afrighted at it. He &s;till to continue his &s;ervice and good will to the Company, was the fir&s;t that would encounter it, and deliver the Dam&s;els; which he did in a &s;hort time, &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully, that he caught the Serpent in both his hands, and holding it out of the water,
<PB N="61" REF="39">
put it into his mouth, and bit the head off. Being taken with his good humour, I afterwards &s;ent for him into the Stove; and finding that he had been employed in the Mines, I asked him among other things, whether he had &s;een any natural Vitriol, and where, in the Mines, cry&s;tallized in lumps, pure and ready for u&s;e, which he &s;aid he had in many places, but in the greate&s;t quantity, in a Mine now given over; by rea&s;on that in &s;ome places the Earth was fallen in, which was near to <HI>Schemnitz:</HI> And accordingly two or three days after he came to &s;ee me at <HI>Schemnitz,</HI> brought me Lamps and Mine-mens habits for my &s;elf, and two Friends more; and we went with him under ground, till I came where he &s;hew'd me great quantities of it, much to my &s;atis|faction: the Vitriol there &s;hooting upon the Stones and Earth, upon the floor and &s;ides of the pa&s;&s;ages, as it doth by art in the Pans, and about the &s;ticks, not hanging from the top, as in many other places I have &s;een it, like to Ice-icles.</P>
<P><HI>Gla&s;s-Hitten</HI> belonges to the Count of <HI>Lippey,</HI> of who&s;e Family was the Learned <HI>Polycarpus Procopius Bocanus,</HI> who was &s;ent &s;ome time pa&s;t by the Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Presburg</HI> to give an account of the rarities of the&s;e Countries; but his death hindred the publi&s;hing of his ob&s;erva|tions.</P>
<P><HI>Ei&s;enbach</HI> about four <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> miles from <HI>Gla&s;s-Hitten,</HI> and five or &s;ix from <HI>Schemnitz,</HI> hath al&s;o hot Baths; the Sediment of which is red, and turnes into &s;tone; &s;o that I brought away with me pieces of it of five or &s;ix inches diameter: I took al&s;o a large piece of this water petre|fied as it fell from a &s;pout in which the waves of it are to be &s;een; but the &s;pout it &s;elf, although made of Wood, was not at all changed, as ly|ing under it. However, tho&s;e Trees with which they built the &s;ides of the Bath were &s;o petrefied, that tho&s;e which lay next above the water, were intirely turned into Stone. And it was not unplea&s;ant to ob|&s;erve how nature did here a&s;&s;i&s;t art, and out of the body of a Firr-Tree frame a Column of Stone. Nor is it much to be wondred at, that the wood under the water &s;hould remain unaltered whil&s;t that above &s;uffer|ed &s;o great a change. The&s;e waters are hot, and part of what&s;oever is contained in them is &s;ufficiently Volatilized to be carried up with the &s;team of the Bath, and I remember in the Bath of the Green Pillars at <HI>Buda,</HI> I took notice, that the exhalation from the Bath reverbera|ted by the high <HI>Cupola</HI> built over it, and by the Irons extended from one Column to another, and by the Capitals of the Pillars was for|med into long Stones like <HI>Ice-icles,</HI> which hang to all the &s;aid places, &s;uch as may be ob&s;erved in many &s;ubterraneous <HI>Grotto</HI>'s, and particu|larly in <HI>England</HI> in <HI>Okey-hole</HI> in <HI>Somer&s;et-&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Pooles-hole</HI> in <HI>Dar|by-&s;hire. Sulphur</HI> al&s;o which is in great quantity in many hot Springs flyeth away continually, and is not to be found in them, if you boyl or evaporate the Bath water: and therefore to di&s;cover it, I thought it more rational to look out of the water than into it; neither was I more deceived in my conjecture, than he who looked towards the We&s;t, rather than towards the Ea&s;t to &s;ee the ri&s;ing of the Sun. For upon many places which were over the Baths, and received the &s;teams of the hot water, I have &s;een <HI>Sulphur</HI> to &s;tick; and to &s;atisfie my curio&s;ity further herein, I cau&s;ed once a Pipe to be opened at <HI>Baden</HI> in <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> through which the hot water continually ran, and took with my hand from the upper part of the Pipe, divers Boxes full of a &s;ub&s;tance

&s;carce to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from Flower of Brim&s;tone. Walking about al&s;o one day in the <HI>Sower Bath</HI> at <HI>Baden,</HI> and leaning over the Balli|&s;tres to talk with &s;ome Friends, who were then bathing them&s;elves, I perceived that my Buttons and what el&s;e I wore of &s;ilver, were all turned yellow of a fair Gold colour, although I were at &s;ome di&s;tance from the water. Which made me try this experiment al&s;o, which was to hang money over the Bath at a foot di&s;tance, or at a greater, to &s;ee what alteration it would make, and how &s;oon; which it co|loured in a minutes time, and that which was nearer in half a mi|nute.</P>
<P>But to return to <HI>Ei&s;enbach,</HI> there are two convenient Baths much fre|quented, and a third which is made by the water let out of the former, called the <HI>Snakes-bath,</HI> from the number of Snakes coming into, and delighting in it when it is filled with the&s;e warm waters.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> the thirtieth, I travelled from <HI>Schemnitz</HI> by <HI>Gla&s;s-Hitten,</HI> and <HI>Apfelsdorff,</HI> where there is a Hou&s;e of the Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Pres|burg;</HI> and afterwards pa&s;&s;ed the River <HI>Gran</HI> and came in between the Hills; where in one place they have thrown up the Earth, and made a work from one ridge of the Hills to the other, to defend the Country; and hinder the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Excur&s;ions towards <HI>Chremnitz:</HI> Afterwards we proceeded by that Golden River and yellow Stream which wa&s;hes all the Ore above till we came to the Town.</P>
<P><HI>Chremnitz</HI> is a &s;mall Town, but hath large Suburbs, and lies high&punc; St. <HI>Johns</HI> Church at &s;ome di&s;tance from it, is thought to &s;tand upon the highe&s;t ground in <HI>Hungary.</HI> This is the olde&s;t Mine-Town, and the riche&s;t in Gold of all the &s;even in the&s;e parts, which are the&s;e, <HI>Schemnitz, Chremnitz, New&s;ol, Koningsberg, Bochantz, Libeten</HI> and <HI>Tiln.</HI></P>
<P>They have worked in the Gold-Mine at <HI>Chremnitz</HI> nine hundred and fifty years; the Mine is about nine or ten <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> miles in length, and there is one <HI>Cuniculus</HI> or Horizontal pa&s;&s;age which is eight hun|dred fathoms long, called the <HI>Erbstall.</HI> The depth of it is above one hundred and &s;eventy fathoms; they do not u&s;e Ladders to de&s;cend into this Mine, but are let down at the end of a Cable, unto which is fa&s;tned a &s;ling, or &s;eat of Leather; the Leather being broad, and divided ordinarily into two or three parts, &s;o that it is to be &s;hifted or changed as you find convenience, and affords no unea&s;ie &s;eat, even to &s;uch as are not u&s;ed to it. And in this manner, who&s;eever enters the Mine is let down. Through one of the <HI>Scha|chts</HI> or perpendicular Pits, of which there are &s;ix. 1. That of <HI>Rodol|phus.</HI> 2. Queen <HI>Anne.</HI> 3. <HI>Ferdinand.</HI> 4. <HI>Matthias.</HI> 5. <HI>Wind&s;chacht,</HI> and 6. <HI>Leopold.</HI> I went down by the Pit of the Emperour <HI>Rodolphus,</HI> gently de&s;cending by the turning about of a large wheel to which the Cable is fa&s;tned, one hundred and eight fathoms deep into the Earth; and after many hours being in the Mine, was drawn out again by <HI>Leopoldi Schacht,</HI> or <HI>Leopolds</HI> Pit, or Shaft, &s;treight up above one hundred and fifty fathoms; a heigh &s;urpa&s;&s;ing that of the Pyramids by a third part. At the bottom of which <HI>Schacht</HI> I was not di&s;couraged to find my &s;elf &s;o deep in the earth, for con&s;idering that I was yet above three thou&s;and miles from the Center, I thought my &s;elf but in a Well. It is built on all &s;ides with Firr-Trees, one laying upon another on four &s;ides from the bottom to the top, and after the &s;ame man|ner
<PB N="63" REF="40">
all the&s;e Mines are kept open where they have not a Rock on all &s;ides.</P>
<P>Many Veins of the Ore run to the North, and to the Ea&s;t; They work al&s;o towards one, two, or three of the clock, as they &s;peak; for the Miners direct them&s;elves under-ground by a Compa&s;s not of thirty two points (&s;uch as is u&s;ed at Sea) but by one of twenty four, which they divide as we do the hours of the day into twice twelve. Of the Gold-Ore &s;ome is white, &s;ome black, &s;ome of it red, and &s;ome yellow. That with black &s;pots in white is e&s;teemed the be&s;t, as al&s;o the Ore which lieth next to the black Veins. This Ore is not rich enough to &s;uffer any proof in &s;mall parcels, like that of other Mines, whereby to know what proportion of Metal is contain'd in it&punc; but they pound a ve|ry great quantity thereof, and wa&s;h it in a little River which runs near the Town: The whole River being divided and admitted into di|vers cuts, runs over the Ore continually, and &s;o wa&s;hes away the earthy parts from the <HI>Metallin,</HI> and from a clear River above the Town, by its running through &s;o many works, and over &s;o much pounded Ore, it becomes below the Town a dark yellow Stream, of the colour of the Earth of tho&s;e Hills. Unle&s;s it be upon &s;ix days of the year; two at <HI>Christmas,</HI> two at <HI>Ea&s;ter,</HI> and two at <HI>Whit&s;untide,</HI> when the River it &s;elf as well as the Mine-men cea&s;eth from working, and is permitted to flow clear within its own Banks.</P>
<P>There have been pieces of pure or virgin Gold found in this Mine, &s;ome of which I have &s;een in the Emperour's Trea&s;ury, and in the Elector of <HI>Saxony</HI>'s Repo&s;itory, one piece as broad as the palm of my hand, and others le&s;s; and upon a white Stone many pieces of pure Gold; but the&s;e are very rare.</P>
<P>The common yellow Earth of the Country near <HI>Chremnitz,</HI> e&s;peci|ally of the Hills towards the We&s;t, although it be not e&s;teemed Ore, affords &s;ome Gold. And in one place I &s;aw a great part of an Hill digg'd away, which hath been ca&s;t into the works, wa&s;hed and wrought in the &s;ame manner, as pounded Ore with con&s;iderable pro|fit.</P>
<P><HI>Matthias Dollinger</HI> the chief Officer at <HI>Chremnitz</HI> for the Mine-work, hath al&s;o lately invented a Mill to pound the Ore finer than it was before; and by this invention hath obtained a con&s;iderable quantity of Gold out of that Ore which otherwi&s;e would have yielded none; in his Hou&s;e I &s;aw many &s;orts of Minerals, and was very kindly en|tertained by him; and when I was at the bottom of the Gold-Mine he &s;ent me down a pre&s;ent of excellent Wine to drink the Emperour's health.</P>
<P>Some pa&s;&s;ages in this Mine cut through the Rock and long di&s;u&s;ed, have grown up again; and I ob&s;erved the &s;ides of &s;ome which had been formerly wide enough to carry their Ore through, to approach each other; &s;o as we pa&s;&s;ed with difficulty; this happens mo&s;t in moi&s;t places, the pa&s;&s;ages unite not from the top to the bottom, but from one &s;ide to another.</P>
<P>They carry their Ore under ground from one place to another; or to the bottom of the Pit whence it is drawn out, in a Box or Che&s;t which they call a Hundt or Dog; this runs upon four whels, it is high|er behind than before, and hath a tongue of Iron at the bottom, which being fitted into a channel of wood framed in the middle of
<PB N="64" REF="41">
the bottom of each pa&s;&s;age, it can no ways deviate, but keeps alwayes in the middle; and by this means a little Boy will run full &s;peed with three or four hundred pound weight of Ore or Earth before him, wherever you command him, without any light, through tho&s;e di&s;|mal dark pa&s;&s;ages of the Mine: and it was very new to me to hear the rattling they make in the Mine, and the alteration of the &s;ound as they are nearer or further from us; and to &s;ee them come with that &s;wiftne&s;s out of the Rocks, overturn their little Charriot, where they are to leave their Ore, then turn again and enter tho&s;e dark Caves with &s;uch a force and &s;wiftne&s;s.</P>
<P>Not much unlike this is another in&s;trument they have to bring the Ore from the mouth of the Mine, or from the Hills down to the <HI>Buchworke,</HI> where they pound it and wa&s;h it; but in&s;tead of a tongue it hath eight wheels or four rowlers and four wheels, and the way is made with Firr in &s;uch manner and at &s;uch a di&s;tance that the row|lers rowl upon the wood of the Firr-trees. And the&s;e rowlers and wheels are &s;o contrived, that the&s;e Che&s;ts can never overturn nor go out of the way, and a child draws them, and &s;ometimes a dog &s;erves the turn. To one <HI>Buchworke</HI> alone, they carry every week three or four hundred of the&s;e Che&s;ts full, and each Che&s;t holds four hundred pound weight.</P>
<P>There were two very bad &s;trong damps in this Mine when I was there, and divers others that had not the like force to &s;uffocate in &s;o &s;mall a time. One of the&s;e Damps was in a <HI>Schacht Puteus</HI> or Pit, and the other in a Stall, or right-on pa&s;&s;age; no Lamps would burn in either of them, yet the Miners would venture into them for &s;ome &s;hort &s;pace of time: and we let one man down into that Damp which was in the Pit five or &s;ix times; but pulled him up again as &s;oon as ever we &s;aw his Lamp go out; this place is mo&s;t poy&s;onous when the water is high, the vapour then ari&s;ing more &s;trongly, the other Damp in the <HI>Cuniculus</HI> they hope to remedy, by perflation, and making or digging another pa&s;&s;age into it.</P>
<P>I was informed that there had been twenty eight men killed at one time, by Damps in four <HI>Cuniculi,</HI> &s;even in each; and in the &s;inking of <HI>Leopold</HI>'s Pit, they were much troubled with Damps, which they remedied in this manner.</P>
<P>They fixed to the &s;ide of the <HI>Schacht</HI> or Pit a Tube from the top to the bottom; and that not proving &s;ufficient they forced down a broad flat board which covered or &s;topped the Pit, or couched very near the &s;ides of it on all &s;ides, but where the Tube was: and &s;o forced out all the Air in the Pit through the Tube; which work they were forced often to repeat. And now they having divers other pa&s;&s;ages into it, the Air is good and &s;ufficient, and I was drawn up through it without the lea&s;t trouble in breathing.</P>
<P><HI>Altermans</HI> Fore-&s;tall, a <HI>Cuniculus</HI> five hundred fathoms long, was burned in the year 1642. by the carele&s;ne&s;s of a boy wiping the &s;nuff of a Lamp upon the wood; and fifty men &s;mothered in it; they were all taken out except one, who was afterwards found to be di&s;&s;olved by the &s;harp waters of the Mine, nothing e&s;caping either of fle&s;h or bones, but only &s;ome of his cloths.</P>

Gold-Ore of &s;mall pointed parts like needles, of a purple colour, and &s;hining, the mother of which is yellow like brim&s;tone, it is called by them Antimony of Gold. There are Cry&s;tals found here, and &s;ome tinctured yellow.</P>
<P>There is a Vitriol-Mine in the&s;e Hills nigh the Gold-Mine, about eighty fathoms deep. The Earth or Ore whereof is reddi&s;h, and &s;ometimes greeni&s;h. This Earth is infu&s;ed in water, and after three days the water is poured off, and boyled &s;even days in a leaden Ve&s;&s;el, till it comes to a thick granulated whiti&s;h &s;ub&s;tance, which is after|wards reduced to a Calx-in an Oven, and &s;erves in the making of <HI>Aqua fortis,</HI> or the &s;eparating water u&s;ed at <HI>Schemnitz.</HI></P>
<P>Where they pound the Gold-Ore, they lay a foundation three yards deep of wood, upon which they place the Ore, over which there are four and twenty Beams armed at the bottom with Iron, which break and grind the Ore, it being covered all the while with water. The&s;e Beams are moved by four Wheels, one Wheel to &s;ix Beams, the water which comes out from the pounded Ore, is let into little Pits or Che&s;ts commonly &s;even or eight one after another; and afterwards into a large Pit of almo&s;t half an Aker of ground, and then after &s;et|ling let out.</P>
<P>The Gold-Ore in powder or pounded is called <HI>Slich,</HI> of which that is the riche&s;t which is neare&s;t to the Beams where it is fir&s;t pounded. They work thus day and night continually. The Candles which they make u&s;e of are of Firr or &s;ome Re&s;inous wood.</P>
<P>They take the <HI>Slich</HI> wa&s;hed &s;o long as perhaps in an hundred pound weight, there may be half an ounce or an ounce of Gold and Silver, the greate&s;t part ordinarily Gold, two thirds generally, (for the <HI>Chrem|nitz</HI> Gold-Ore is &s;eldom without &s;ome mixture of Silver, and the be&s;t of the <HI>Schemnitz</HI> Silver-Ore yields an eighth part of Gold in pro|portion to the Silver;) to this <HI>Slich</HI> they add Lime&s;tone and Slacken, and melt them together in the melting Furnace.</P>
<P>This fir&s;t melting produces a &s;ub&s;tance called <HI>Lech;</HI> this <HI>Lech</HI> they burn with Charcoal to make it lighter, to open its body and render it porous, and then it is called <HI>Ro&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>To the <HI>Ro&s;t</HI> they add Sand as they &s;ee occa&s;ion, and melt it again in the melting Furnace; then let it out into the Pan, and proceed as in the melting of Silver.</P>
<P>They have divers other ways to get the Gold out of the pounded Ore, and I cannot omit to &s;et down this one, in which they proceed without Lead.</P>
<P>They wa&s;h the pounded Ore often, and lay it in powder upon Cloths, and by the gentle oblique de&s;cending of the water over it, and their continual &s;tirring it, the earthy, clayi&s;h, and lighter parts are wa&s;ht away, while the heavier and metalline remain in the Cloth: not much unlike to this proceeding is that with Sheep-skins and Wooll, which they place either in the water which comes from the works, or in rivulets which have their Heads hid in Hills and Mountains rich in Gold; &s;o that while the water and fluid parts pa&s;s through or over them, the more &s;olid, heavy and metalline are in&s;nared; and by this way &s;ome have obtained the Golden Fleece. But to continue the man|ner of working with cloths, they wa&s;h the cloths in which the Ore doth &s;tick in &s;everal Tubs, and the water after &s;ome &s;etling is pour'd
<PB N="66" REF="42">
off from its Sediment; which Sediment is again wa&s;ht and &s;tirr'd up in &s;everal Ve&s;&s;els and Troughs, till at length they &s;prinkle Quick &s;il|ver upon it, and knead it well together for an hour or two; and then wa&s;hing it again in a wooden Ve&s;&s;el, after the &s;eparating of much of it, which the Quick-&s;ilver touches not, by &s;triking this Ve&s;&s;el again&s;t their leg, they bring the Gold and Quick-&s;ilver together in an <HI>Amal|gama,</HI> to one corner of it. From this <HI>Amalgama</HI> they &s;train as much of the Quick-&s;ilver as they can through cour&s;e cloths fir&s;t, and then through fine. They put the Ma&s;s remaining upon a perforated Plate, which they &s;et over a deep Pan placed in the Earth; in the bottom of which Pan they al&s;o put Quick-&s;ilver: This Pan they cover, and lute the cover well, and then make a Charcoal fire, upon it, and drive down the Quick-&s;ilver yet remaining in the Gold to the re&s;t in the bottom of the Pan; and then taking out the Gold, they ca&s;t it into the fire that it may &s;till become purer.</P>
<P>After &s;ome few days having &s;een the mo&s;t remarkable curio&s;ities of <HI>Chremnitz,</HI> I went to <HI>New&s;ol;</HI> pa&s;&s;ing tho&s;e Hills which lie on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of <HI>Chremnitz,</HI> upon the top of one of which lies a va&s;t Stone or Rock alone by it &s;elf, near the way-&s;ide; the&s;e Hills afford wood for the Service of the Gold-Mine. Pa&s;&s;ing on further we were not far from <HI>Lila,</HI> a Village, where they find Quick-&s;ilver; and after we had travelled over the Quick-&s;ilver Hills, we came again to the River <HI>Gran,</HI> upon which <HI>New&s;ol</HI> &s;tands; there is a Bridge of wood to pa&s;s the River at this Town, and an hand&s;om building of Piles &s;horing cro&s;s the River to &s;top the wood thrown into this River, ten miles higher, where the Country is very full of wood: and by this Artifice with|out labour or charge, it is conveyed to <HI>New&s;ol,</HI> to be u&s;ed in the work|ing of the Copper-Ore, and in the burning, melting, ca&s;ting, hammering of the Copper.</P>
<P><HI>New&s;ol</HI> is an hand&s;ome Town, and hath a large <HI>Piazza,</HI> at the upper end whereof &s;tands a fair Tower. The Ca&s;tle al&s;o is worth the &s;ee|ing, in which is the Church covered over with Copper; within the Church there are many Figures of carved Wood, and &s;ome Reliques: but being in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Lutherans</HI> they are not much re|garded, though carefully pre&s;erved. As I al&s;o ob&s;erved in &s;ome <HI>Lu|theran</HI> Churches in <HI>Germany,</HI> as at <HI>Nuremberg,</HI> and <HI>Magdeburg,</HI> where &s;ome Reliques had been left; which they have not parted with, but &s;till keep as rarities.</P>
<P>At this Town, and near unto it, are the greate&s;t Copper-works in <HI>Hungary,</HI> the body of the Copper being very &s;trongly united to its Stone, Bed, or Ore, the &s;eparation of it is effected with great la|bour and difficulty; for the Copper-Ore taken out of the Mine is burned and melted fourteen times before that it becomes fit for u&s;e; and fir&s;t it is melted with a Stone which they call <HI>Flu&s;s-&s;tein,</HI> and its own dro&s;s, and with <HI>Kis</HI> or a &s;ort of <HI>Pyrites.</HI> It is afterwards carri|ed to the <HI>Ro&s;t-hearth,</HI> where it is laid upon great &s;tacks or heaps of Billets, and tho&s;e &s;et on fire under it; by which means it is bur|ned into a &s;ub&s;tance called <HI>Ro&s;t,</HI> and this is repeated &s;even or eight times; afterwards it is melted again in the melting Furnace, and at two Furnaces more at <HI>Mi&s;mills,</HI> and twice at the Hammer.</P>
<P>Here they al&s;o melt <HI>Kis</HI> which is brought hither from <HI>Je&s;ina,</HI> which &s;ub&s;tance melted is &s;erviceable in the melting of Silver.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="42">
At <HI>Mi&s;mills</HI> not far from hence they get Silver out of Copper, which they &s;eperate thus: They add Lead to the Copper when it is melted, and take out the Metals melted together in Spoons or Iron Di&s;hes. When it is cold they give it a &s;trong fire again as it lies upon cro&s;s Bars, untill the Silver and Lead melts and falls through. When the Copper hath pa&s;&s;ed its la&s;t melting and is fit for u&s;e, they cut it in pieces, with great Hammers which are &s;harp, to move every one of which there is a Mill on purpo&s;e, which with great force lift|eth up the Hammer: and to &s;hape and form it into Ve&s;&s;els or Plates, they have other Hammers, which are flat or round according as they intend to frame the Copper.</P>
<P>The Governor of the&s;e Works at <HI>New&s;ol</HI> was highly obliging, and be&s;ides the giving us opportunity of &s;eeing every thing we de&s;ired, he &s;ent me a hand&s;om pre&s;ent of Wine and Fowls, and wrote a Letter to the Praefect of the Copper-Mine at <HI>Herrn-grundt</HI> to &s;hew me every thing that was curious and ob&s;ervable in that Mine.</P>
<P><HI>Herrn-Grundt</HI> is a little Town &s;eated very high between two Hills, upon a part of Land of the &s;ame name, an <HI>Hungarian</HI> mile di&s;tant from <HI>New&s;ol.</HI> The Country about was then all covered with Snow after we came to &s;uch a heighth, but in the Valleys, and in our journey from <HI>New&s;ol</HI> hither we met with none; &s;o that we found the Air very piercing as we pa&s;&s;ed towards the entrance of the Mine in Miners ha|bits; which habit con&s;i&s;ts of a Linen Coat and Drawers, a &s;tiff round Cap, like the crown of a Hat, a leather Apron turned behind, and two pieces of Leather tyed to the Knees, to defend tho&s;e parts again&s;t any &s;udden &s;triking again&s;t the Rocks, or the fall of Earth upon them. In the Mine we were warm enough.</P>
<P>I went into this Mine through a <HI>Cuniculus</HI> called <HI>Tach&s;toln,</HI> and con|tinued divers hours in the Mine, and vi&s;ited many of the mo&s;t remar|kable places in it. The &s;leep de&s;cents in this Mine are made by Lad|ders or Trees &s;et upright, with deep notches or &s;tayers cut in them to &s;tay the foot upon: They are not troubled with water, the Mine lying high in the Hill, &s;o that the water may drain away; but they are mo|le&s;ted with du&s;t, which is choaking and fretting, and al&s;o with pernici|ous damps.</P>
<P>In one place of the Mine they &s;hewed me the manner how they had lately cured a very bad Damp by a great pair of Bellows, which were blown continually for many days; and in divers other places the Damps were &s;o &s;trong as to hinder the Work-men very much in their labour, and the&s;e Damps are not only met with in places where the Earth is full of Clay or the like &s;ub&s;tances, but al&s;o where it is rocky, and one place they &s;hewed me where there had been a pernicious Damp, and yet the Rock &s;o hard, that it could not be broken by their In&s;truments; but the de&s;cent was all made by the means of Gun-pow|der ramm'd into long holes in the Rock, and &s;o blown up.</P>
<P>Much of this Mine lies in the Rocks where they have no need of Wood-work to keep it open, and &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages lie between the Rock and the Earth, &s;o that they are kept open upon one &s;ide by Firr-Trees, and on the other &s;ide with Stone, the pa&s;&s;ages al&s;o are not &s;o regular as at <HI>Chremnitz,</HI> for many here are neither horizontal, nor near to a per|pendicular, but moderately inclining up and down, and there are many large Cavities within. In one place where we de&s;cended obliquely to
<PB N="68" REF="43">
go to a remarkable part of the Mine, we found that the Earth had fal|len in and &s;topped up the pa&s;&s;age, but one of our Guides unwilling to go about, and the Earth being yet loo&s;e, he made a Burrough into it and digged his way through, although the Earth continually fell upon him and covered him; and got at length through and tumbled down among&s;t the Work-men below, with a great quantity of Earth after him; with which they &s;o &s;peedily laded their Barrows and Hundts, of which I &s;pake before, and the Boys ran away with them with &s;uch &s;wift|ne&s;s, that in a &s;hort time he made the pa&s;&s;age clear again up to the place where he had left us.</P>
<P>The Veins of this Mine are very large, many of them, &s;uch as are termed <HI>cumulatoe,</HI> and the Ore is very rich, in an hundred pounds of Ore they ordinarily find twenty pounds of Copper, &s;ometimes thirty, forty, half Copper, and even to &s;ixty in the hundred. Much of the Ore is joyned &s;o fa&s;t to the Rock, that 'tis &s;eparated with great diffi|culty, and in many places the Ore and the Rock are one continued Body or Stone, onely with this difference that one part of the Rock will yield Copper, the other none; which is known and di&s;tingui&s;hed by the colour, and ea&s;ily at fir&s;t &s;ight, the Copper-Ore being for the mo&s;t part, e&s;pecially the be&s;t of it, either yellow or black: The yellow is pure Copper-Ore, the black contains al&s;o a proportion of Silver.</P>
<P>There are divers &s;orts of Vitriol found in this Mine, white, green, blue, and a red clear tran&s;parent. There is al&s;o a green Earth or Sedi|ment of a green Water, called <HI>Berg-Grun,</HI> u&s;ed by the Painters; there are likewi&s;e Stones found of a beautiful green and blue colour, and one &s;ort upon which <HI>Turcoi&s;es</HI> have been found, and therefore called the Mother of the <HI>Turcois.</HI></P>
<P>There are al&s;o two Springs of a Vitriolat Water which turn Iron in|to Copper, called the old and the new <HI>Ziment;</HI> the&s;e Springs lie very deep in the Mine, and the Iron is ordinarily left in the water fourteen days. The&s;e Waters are very profitable, &s;eeing that the wor&s;t &s;ort of Iron, and u&s;ele&s;s old Iron is hereby turned into the pure&s;t &s;ort of Cop|per, which hath this commendation above other Copper to be more ductile, malleable, and ea&s;ily melted; and I have melted it without the addition of any other &s;ub&s;tance, without difficulty. Whil&s;t the Ore of Copper mu&s;t run through many Fires and Furnaces to be brought to any thing. Of this &s;ort of Copper I took a good quantity out of the old <HI>Ziment,</HI> and I took al&s;o a piece of Copper of the Figure of a Heart which had been layed in it eleven or twelve days before; having the &s;ame Figure, but as perfectly Iron then, as it is at this day Copper. Some will not have this to be a Tran&s;mutation of one Metal into ano|ther, but that this Water of the <HI>Ziment</HI> being &s;aturated with a <HI>Vitrio|lum Veneris,</HI> and meeting with &s;uch a body &s;o ready to receive it as <HI>Mars,</HI> it depo&s;es <HI>Venus,</HI> who immediately in&s;inuates her &s;elf &s;o far into <HI>Mars,</HI> that &s;he doth <HI>dividere &amp; imperare,</HI> and at la&s;t &s;he &s;ub&s;ti|tutes her own body, and precipitates that of <HI>Mars.</HI></P>
<P>In the changing of Iron into Copper in the&s;e Springs, many parts are indeed often &s;eparated, and lie at the bottom in powder, but the&s;e parts are not Iron but Copper; and I have taken of this powder out of the Spring, and melted it into excellent Copper; &s;o that if the Iron be not changed, I know not what becomes of it. This Operation
<PB N="69" REF="43">
which nature &s;o curiou&s;ly performs in the Mine, I have &s;ince &s;een at|tempted to be imitated by Art; and in my judgment &s;ucce&s;sfully.</P>
<P>After that I had &s;een many of the mo&s;t remarkable places in the Mine, I returned to the <HI>Verwalter</HI> of <HI>Herrn-Grundt</HI> his Hou&s;e, and put my clothes on again in the Stove: where we were afterwards very kindly entertained. He &s;hewed me a Map of that Mine wherein we had &s;pent mo&s;t part of that day; and the delineations of all tho&s;e places we had been at, with a Scale to mea&s;ure the lengths and di&s;tan|ces of all Pa&s;&s;ages and Places in the Mine; and it was very delightful to &s;ee &s;o large a Draught or Picture of &s;o fair a Subterraneous City: nor can I term it le&s;s, in which there is more building than in many. The extent &s;urpa&s;&s;es mo&s;t, and the number of the Inhabitants are con&s;ide|rable, their Order admirable, their Watches exact, their Re&s;t undi|&s;turbed, grateful after Labour and refre&s;hing, they repo&s;ing them&s;elves eight hours in the hollow of a Rock after the &s;ame time &s;pent in labour; be&s;ides this Map, he &s;hew'd me many curious Minerals taken out of that Mine, and by heating the Copper-Ore, and ca&s;ting it into water, made the water like &s;ome natural Baths which ari&s;e near the&s;e Hills. And upon my commending the <HI>Ziment</HI> water and its &s;trange Opera|tion upon Iron, he pre&s;ented me with divers fair pieces, and a chain of Copper tran&s;muted in tho&s;e Springs. They make al&s;o very hand|&s;ome Cups and Ve&s;&s;els out of this &s;ort of Copper, and we drank out of one of them which was gilded over, and had a rich piece of Silver-Ore fa&s;tned in the middle of it; and this In&s;cription graved on the out&s;ide:
<Q><L>Ei&s;en ware ich, Kup&s;er bin ich</L>
<L>Silber trag ich, Goldt bedeckt mich. <HI>i. c.</HI></L></Q>
<Q><L>Copper I am, but Iron was of old,</L>
<L>Silver I carry, cover'd am with Gold,</L></Q></P>
<P>The profit which the Emperor makes by his Mines, is reckoned to amount to an hundred and twenty Thou&s;and pounds <HI>&s;terling</HI> yearly. But when they come to deal with deeper and richer veins of Ore, and that there &s;hall be by degrees more of the&s;e Vitriolate Copper &s;prings di&s;covered, this revenue will then be encrea&s;ed. And it is more than probable that time will bring more of them to light; for at <HI>Zolnock,</HI> and other places near the <HI>Carpathian</HI> Hills there are divers of the &s;ame &s;prings already made u&s;e of. But if furthermore, con&s;idering the no|blene&s;s of the&s;e &s;prings, containing in them the true mature Salt of <HI>Ve|nus,</HI> &s;ome Per&s;ons hereafter &s;hall be &s;o fortunate, as moreover to di&s;|cover and experimentally improve the u&s;e of Springs and Fountains &s;aturated with a <HI>Vitriolum Lunoe,</HI> and learn perfectly how to adapt Metalline Bodies to the adaequate energy, and activity of &s;uch waters; The improvement by tran&s;mutation as it is at pre&s;ent more than ten to one, &s;o it will in tho&s;e dayes amount to above a hundred to one, and the u&s;e of the&s;e Mines and Metalline labours may hereby effectually prove in times to come one of the Riche&s;t Jewels in the Imperial Crown.</P>
<P>From <HI>Herrn-Grundt</HI> we came to <HI>Stubn,</HI> a Town three <HI>Hungarian</HI> miles di&s;tant from <HI>New&s;ol,</HI> and two from <HI>Chremnitz;</HI> where near unto
<PB N="70" REF="44">
a Rivolet there are divers hot Baths of great e&s;teem, and much fre|quented; the water whereof is very clear and &s;inells of <HI>Sulphur,</HI> the Se|diment green; it colours the wood over it green and black, but doth not change the colour of Metals &s;o &s;oon as mo&s;t others; I left money in it a whole night, which was yet but faintly coloured. The Springs ari&s;e underneath, and pa&s;s through the holes in the plancher of the Baths.</P>
<P>The heat of the&s;e is an&s;werable to that of the Kings-Bath in <HI>Eng|land;</HI> there are &s;even in number: The fir&s;t is the Noblemans Bath, the &s;econd the Gentlemans, the third the Country-mans, the fourth the Country-womans, the fifth the Beggars Bath, the &s;ixth for &s;uch as are infected with the <HI>Lues Venerea,</HI> the &s;eventh the Bath of the <HI>Gyp&s;ies.</HI> The&s;e Baths are in a Plain encompa&s;&s;ed on all &s;ides with Hills, the nighe&s;t unto them are towards the Ea&s;t; and it is the &s;ame ridge of Hills which on the other &s;ide are &s;o rich in Metals. I bath'd in one of the&s;e and met good company that I was detained too long, and received &s;ome inconvenience from the heat of the Bath, nor could I commend their cu&s;tom of eating, drinking, and &s;leeping much while they bathed.</P>
<P>From <HI>Stub'n Bad</HI> we went to <HI>Boinitz,</HI> cro&s;&s;ing the River <HI>Nitra</HI> and leaving <HI>Privitz</HI> a large Town on the left hand. At <HI>Boinitz</HI> there are al&s;o five natural Baths of a moderate gentle heat delightful to bath in, being much beautified by Count <HI>Palfi</HI> Palatine of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and all of them covered under one large roof. The fir&s;t is the Noblemans Bath built of Stone, de&s;cended into on all &s;ides by Stone &s;tairs; the other four are of wood, very hand&s;omely and well built, where it was a plea|&s;ure to us to &s;ee the Boys and Girls dive &s;o finely for any thing that we ca&s;t in. About this part of the Country there grows very much Saffron.</P>
<P>From <HI>Boinitz</HI> we went to <HI>We&s;tonitz,</HI> two <HI>Hungarian</HI> miles, and from <HI>We&s;tonitz</HI> the next day, we arrived at <HI>Tren&s;chin,</HI> which they count four <HI>Hungarian</HI> miles; but &s;uch long ones they are, that we were travelling from before Sun-ri&s;ing till eight of the Clock at night, before we could come to our journeys end.</P>
<P><HI>Tren&s;chin</HI> is a hand&s;ome Town &s;eated upon the River <HI>Waag,</HI> over which there is a Bridge of wood; the <HI>Piazza</HI> is fair, the Je&s;uites Church hand&s;ome, the Ca&s;tle &s;eated very high, ea&s;ily di&s;cernable at twenty <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> miles di&s;tance, and belonged to the <HI>Graff Jellha&s;ey.</HI> There are two warm Baths a mile from the Town, and a great num|ber of Springs of Mineral waters in the Country about. Here we met with Count <HI>Rothall</HI> going from the Emperor to treat with <HI>Abaffi</HI> Prince of <HI>Tran&s;ylvania</HI> his Commi&s;&s;ioners at <HI>Eperies,</HI> where I engaged &s;ome of his Attendants to make enquiry into the Salt-Mines of that place, or any other, according to the in&s;tructions I left with them, and after|wards I received an Account to this effect.</P>
<P>Half an hours going from the City of <HI>Eperies</HI> in upper <HI>Hungary,</HI> there is a Salt-Mine of great note from the fir&s;t place of de&s;cent unto the bottom, it is about one hundred and four&s;core fathoms deep. Into this the Miners de&s;cend fir&s;t by Ropes, and at la&s;t by Ladders unto the lower parts. The Mine is for the mo&s;t part in an Earthy, and not a Rocky ground.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="44">
The Veins of Salt are large, and there are pieces to be found of ten thou&s;and pound weight: they commonly hew out the Salt into long &s;quare pieces of two foot in length, and one in thickne&s;s, and for u&s;e it is broken and grinded between two Grind &s;tones.</P>
<P>The Mine is cold and moi&s;t, but the Salt being a Stone &s;alt, is not ea&s;ily di&s;&s;olved, or at lea&s;t in any great quantity by dampne&s;s or moi|&s;ture; yet much of the water of the Mine is impregnated with &s;alt, in &s;uch &s;ort that being drawn out in large buckets, and afterwards boyl'd up, it affords a blacki&s;h Salt, which they give to their Cattle in that Country.</P>
<P>The colour of the ordinary Stone-&s;alt of this Mine is not very white, but &s;omewhat grey: yet being broken and grinded to powder, it be|comes as white as if it were refined, and this Salt con&s;i&s;ts of pointed parts or fo&s;&s;ets. Another &s;ort of Salt there is al&s;o, which con&s;i&s;ts of Squares and Tables; and a third to be found of &s;omewhat &s;tirious or long &s;hoots.</P>
<P>Nor is all the Salt of this Mine of one colour, but of divers; that which is found gro&s;ly mixt with the Earth receives &s;ome colour from it; and even that which is mo&s;t pure and re&s;embles Cry&s;tal, doth often receive tinctures of &s;everal colours; in the middle of a Cry&s;tal|&s;alt with long &s;hoots, I have &s;een a delicate blue; and at Count <HI>Ro|thall</HI> his Hou&s;e at <HI>Vienna,</HI> I &s;aw a large piece of a fair tran&s;parent yellow. There are al&s;o &s;ome pieces &s;o clear and hard, that they carve them into divers Figures, as if they were Cry&s;tal it &s;elf. Of all the&s;e &s;orts men|tioned I al&s;o obtained &s;ome pieces, and brought them with me into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But it is time to conclude this long di&s;cour&s;e of Mines and Minerals, which may &s;eem of little concern unto many; yet for the &s;atisfaction of the more curious in &s;o con&s;iderable a piece of Naturals, in places lit|tle known unto us; and withal, unde&s;cribed by any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pen that I know; I would not omit this particular account thereof.</P>

<P>A great part of the&s;e Countries of upper <HI>Hungaria,</HI> through which I travelled, had a different face from that of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> and from what they had formerly been.

Even in parts of the Country better provided, and un|der the Emperor, a great part of the people being of the <HI>Lutheran,</HI> or the reformed Religion, are under &s;uch hard mea&s;ure and fears that they live in little content, and being of a &s;tout and per&s;evering temper, they may in time become &s;o de&s;perate, that if the <HI>Turk</HI> &s;hould break power|fully

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Unto the &s;trange Lake of <HI>Zirchnitz,</HI> to the Quick-&s;ilver Mines at <HI>Idria,</HI> and to other remarkable places in the <HI>Alpes.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHILE I remained at <HI>Vienna,</HI> I took the pains to &s;ee di|vers places not far di&s;tant from it, as <HI>N&eacute;ugeb&aacute;u, Kalen|berg, Clo&s;ter, Newberg, Itzing, Baden, Laxamburg, New|&s;idler-See,</HI> with others; and afterwards made a jour|ney unto <HI>Venice,</HI> not by the Stage-Coaches which keep one con&s;tant road, but cho&s;e rather to perform it by Hor&s;e whereby I might &s;tay in any place, or go out of the road at plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t con&s;iderable place we &s;aw was <HI>Baden,</HI> about four <HI>German</HI> miles from <HI>Vienna,</HI> a pretty walled Town &s;eated near a part of Mount <HI>Cetius,</HI> which divided <HI>Noricum</HI> from <HI>Pannonia;</HI> a Rivolet named <HI>Swe|chet</HI> pa&s;&s;es by it, which afterwards enlarges and runs into the <HI>Da|nube</HI> about a <HI>German</HI> mile from <HI>Vienna,</HI> there are three Churches, that of the <HI>Augu&s;tiners,</HI> of our Lady, and S. <HI>Stephen;</HI> but this place is mo&s;t remarkable for its Baths which are much frequented from <HI>Vienna</HI> and the&s;e parts. The Springs being numerous and affording nine conveni|ent Baths, two within the Town, five without the Wall, and two be|yond a Rivolet called <HI>Swechet.</HI></P>
<P>The Dukes-Bath is the large&s;t, about twenty foot &s;quare, in the mid|dle of a Hou&s;e of the &s;ame Figure, built over it. The vapour pa&s;&s;es through a tunnel of Wood, at the top: and the Water is conveyed into the bottom of the Bath, at one corner through wooden pipes and Trees, under the Town-wall, from the Spring head, which ri&s;es at a little di&s;tance We&s;tward. The Springs of the re&s;t of the Baths ri&s;e under them, and let in through holes of the Plancher, for all the Baths are Wain&s;coted, the Seats, Sides, and Bottom being made of Firr. The Wa|ter for the mo&s;t part is clear and tran&s;parent, yet &s;omewhat blewi&s;h, and makes the Skin appear pale in it, in the &s;ame manner as the Smoak of

Brim&s;tone, it coloureth Metals (except Gold, the colour of which it al&s;o heightens) turning them black in a few minutes. The Coyn of this Country, which is mixed of Copper and Silver, (having 7/15 of Sil|ver, and 8/15 of Copper) is in a minutes time turned from a white into a dark yellow, and &s;oon after becomes black. It gives a fine green colour to the Mo&s;s and Plants which it wa&s;hes, and leaves often a &s;cum upon them of a purple, mixed with white As it runs from the Spring-head, it &s;omewhat re&s;embles the Sulphur River in the way from <HI>Tivoli</HI> to <HI>Rome,</HI> but is not &s;o &s;trange or &s;tinking nor doth it incru&s;tate its banks.</P>
<P>The Spring head is al&s;o con&s;iderable, in regard that it ri&s;es under a rocky Hill, at &s;ome di&s;tance from the entrance, and I pa&s;&s;ed to it a|bout the length of forty yards, through an Arched pa&s;&s;age cut in the Rock, which is al&s;o a natural &s;tove, (as that of <HI>Tritola</HI> and <HI>Baiae&punc;)</HI> made by the hot Bath water running under it, mo&s;t part of the top of this Cave is incru&s;tated with a white &s;ub&s;tance which towards the mouth becomes harder and &s;tony. I cau&s;ed &s;ome of the Pipes through which the Bath water runs to be opened, and from the upper part of the Pipe. I took &s;ome quantity of the Sulphur in powder, it being very like flowers of Brim&s;tone, this being as it were &s;ublimed from the water and not depo&s;ed, it being found in the upper part of the Pipe, <HI>oleum Sulphu|ris per campanum</HI> dropped into this water, is received into it quietly, <HI>Oleum Tartari per deliquium</HI> cau&s;es an ebullition as in the making of <HI>Tartarum Vitriolatum.</HI></P>
<P>The Second Bath within the Wall is our Lady's Bath, about twelve foot broad and twenty four foot long. One end of this is under a Church of the &s;ame name. This is fuller of Sulphur than the re&s;t, and more blew, and leaves a yellow flower upon the boards, as the others do a white.</P>
<P>The Third is the New Bath, without the Town near the Gate, when I &s;aw it, it was full of People who were making merry and &s;inging.</P>
<P>The Fourth is the Jews Bath, this hath a partition in the middle, to &s;eparate the Men from the Women.</P>
<P>The Fifth is St. <HI>John's</HI> Bath of a triangular Figure.</P>
<P>The Sixth is the Beggars Bath, alwayes &s;hallow &s;o as they lie down in it.</P>
<P>The Seventh is the Bath of the holy Cro&s;s, about two &s;athoms &s;quare, chiefly for the Clergy.</P>
<P>The Eighth is St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Bath, this is greener than the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The Ninth is the Sower-Bath, this is &s;et about with &s;tone Bala&s;tres, and covered with a hand&s;ome Cupola and a Lanthorn, the Water is ve|ry clear, in the &s;tream of this Bath I have often coloured Money black without touching the Water; yet the Water it &s;elf being once cold changes not the colour of Metals, although they be boyled in it.</P>
<P>The hotte&s;t of the&s;e Baths have not the heat of the Queens Bath at <HI>Bathe</HI> in <HI>England.</HI> They u&s;e no Guides as with us, but direct them|&s;elves with a &s;hort turned Staff.</P>
<P>Here we met with very good Company, and all kind of accommo|dation at no dear rate. A Captain of the Emperour's whom I had ac|companied to the&s;e Baths as a token of his love gave me a <HI>Gempskugel</HI> which is &s;aid to be an excre&s;cence upon the Liver of a wild Goat of <HI>Tyrol,</HI> and highly cryed up in <HI>Germany</HI> for a &s;ignal remedy again&s;t the

<P>Having bathed in the Baths, and taken a draught of the Town, I left <HI>Baden,</HI> and the next con&s;iderable place was <HI>New&s;tad,</HI> one of the chiefe&s;t Cities in <HI>Au&s;tria;</HI> it is of a &s;quare Figure with a <HI>Piazza</HI> in the middle of it, two &s;ides whereof are arched and &s;upported with Pillars: there are four Gates, three whereof are to be &s;een from the <HI>Piazza;</HI> St. <HI>Jacobs</HI> is the chiefe&s;t Church, which hath two Steeples in the Front. The Emperor hath a Palace here of a &s;quare Building with four Towers, which are to be &s;een a great way off, as is al&s;o mo&s;t part of the Town, as lying in a Mari&s;h Ground, and in a plain Country; it is encompa&s;|&s;ed with a Ditch and two Walls, the one very low, the other &s;eems not &s;trong; yet as they told me, at one time the <HI>Turk</HI> could not take it, but left it upon condition that they might take &s;omething out of the Town; which being granted, they took the <HI>Pronger</HI> or <HI>Whipping-Post,</HI> and carried it unto <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> and at another time in the Year 1529. <HI>Solyman</HI> the Magnificent &s;tormed it &s;even times in one day, and was every time repul&s;ed. At this place Count <HI>Peter Serini</HI> and <HI>Frangipani</HI> were beheaded, as being chief Contrivers in the <HI>Hungarian</HI> Revolt.</P>
<P>From hence through the Plains we came to Mount <HI>Simeren</HI> pa&s;&s;ing by <HI>Newkirckel,</HI> where there is a Chappel with a little red Pinnacle which they &s;ay was built by an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> King; I &s;uppo&s;e by King <HI>Richard</HI> the fir&s;t, who was kept Pri&s;oner in <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> in his return from the Holy Land, who&s;e Ran&s;om built the old Walls of <HI>Vienna.</HI> Mount <HI>Simeren</HI> is a part of Mount <HI>Cetius</HI> upon the top whereof lies an heap of Stones which make the boundary between <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> and <HI>Styria;</HI> the a&s;cent of the Hill is &s;teep and &s;tony; &s;o that &s;ometimes it takes twenty four Hor|&s;es or Oxen to draw up a Cart or Coach.</P>
<P>We lodged at <HI>Schotwien</HI> or <HI>Schadtwien,</HI> a &s;trange Town &s;eated between Rocks upon the pa&s;&s;age of the Hills, the Hou&s;es upon the &s;ides of the Rocks are inacce&s;&s;ible but from the Top of the Hills, and looking over the Plains, &s;erve for Watch-Towers; this is a clo&s;e &s;trong place, and called by &s;ome <HI>Clau&s;tra Austriae;</HI> having the Mountains on each hand, and &s;hut up with a Gate at each end; a &s;mall current coming down from the Hills, is admitted into the Town under the Wall, which put me in mind of the Picture of the Wall to the Kingdom of <HI>China,</HI> wherein is expre&s;&s;ed the manner of the Rivers running into <HI>China,</HI> the Wall being &s;till continued over them. From hence I came to <HI>Mehrzu&s;chlag,</HI> the place where they beat out the Iron into Bars; &s;o to <HI>Keimburg</HI> pa&s;&s;ing by a &s;wi&s;t &s;mall River named <HI>Murtz,</HI> then travelled by a Ca&s;tle belong|ing to the Family of <HI>Stubnberg,</HI> which is e&s;teemed one of the Anciente&s;t in <HI>Germany,</HI> and came to <HI>Prug,</HI> &s;eated upon the River <HI>Mur</HI> or <HI>Muer,</HI> a &s;wift large River, but not navigable, although after it hath pa&s;&s;ed by <HI>Gratz</HI> and <HI>Rakenburg</HI> it enlarges. <HI>Prug</HI> or <HI>Muripons</HI> is not ill built con&s;idering the Country, and hath a fair <HI>Piazza.</HI> Another Town of this name I had &s;een before &s;eated upon the River <HI>Leyta,</HI> and for di|&s;tinction called <HI>Prug</HI> upon the <HI>Leyta,</HI> &s;o forward by <HI>Luheim</HI> where the Staple of Iron is.

<P>St. <HI>Veit,</HI> who&s;e name this place bears, was a zealous Chri&s;tian who laboured much in the Conver&s;ion of the&s;e parts, and was per&s;ecuted under <HI>Diocle&s;ian.</HI> Many Churches and Towns do carry his name in other parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> and the People have an opinion of St. <HI>Veit</HI> in the curing of that dacing di&s;ea&s;e called <HI>Chorea Sancti Viti.</HI></P>
<P>From hence we travelled to <HI>Saal,</HI> or <HI>Solua,</HI> anciently a <HI>Roman</HI> Colony, and &s;et down in the Map of <HI>Wolfgangus Lazius</HI> by the name of <HI>Colonia Soluen&s;is;</HI> a Field near unto it, is called <HI>Ager Soluen&s;is</HI> or <HI>Zolfeldt,</HI> a place very fruitful in Antiquities, many whereof have been carried into other parts: in this Field I &s;aw that much &s;poken of&punc; Antiquity of the Kings Chair; it is made of Stone &s;et together in the form of two Elbow-Chairs turned back to back.

This was al&s;o brought from the above mention|ed Field of <HI>Saal.</HI> There are three noble Ma&s;&s;y Fountains ob&s;ervable in the&s;e hilly parts, the&s;e two of St. <HI>Veit</HI> and <HI>Clagenfurt,</HI> and another of white Marble at <HI>Saltzburg.</HI></P>
<P>Among the odd Cu&s;toms of <HI>Carinthia</HI> there is an old one delivered<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>By</HI> Aenaeas Sylvius.</NOTE> of this place, that if a man were vehemently &s;u&s;pected of theft, they hanged him, and three days after judged of the Fact; if he were found guilty they let his body hang till it was corrupted, if otherwi&s;e, they took down the body, buried it upon the publick account, and &s;aid prayers for his &s;oul. <HI>Clagenfurt</HI> was then full of Souldiers, where I had the honour to &s;ee Count <HI>Le&s;ley</HI> the chief Commander, Baron <HI>la Hay,</HI> and my Lord <HI>Pea&s;ly</HI> who had a Company in the Town, who&s;e &s;ingular civilities and favours I cannot &s;ufficiently acknowledge, they obliged me to be at their Table while I &s;tayed, and one day my Lord <HI>Le&s;ley</HI> carried me in his Barge through a hand&s;om &s;treight cut into the Werd-Sea or Lake of <HI>Clagenfurt</HI> to a hou&s;e of plea&s;ure called <HI>Loretto,</HI> finely &s;eated, and which hath a Chappel in it, built after the &s;ame manner with that of <HI>Loretto</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> which having formerly &s;een, I was the bet|ter able to confirm the exact imitation of it.

<P>Leaving <HI>Clagenfurt,</HI> I continued my Journey Southward, and af|ter a <HI>German</HI> mile and half cro&s;&s;ed the River <HI>Dravus</HI> where I found it already a large &s;wift River, pa&s;&s;ing over two long Bridges of Wood, and an I&s;land in the middle; and after an hour or two I began to enter between the Hills at a place called the <HI>Hammer,</HI> where the Iron is bea|ten out, and proceeded in order to my pa&s;&s;age over Mount <HI>Luibel.</HI>

<P>In a&s;cending this Hill we had bad weather, rain and fierce hail, and and the &s;now laid &s;till by the way-&s;ide; and being &s;o high at the time of a &s;trom, I had an opportunity to &s;ee the Clouds de&s;cend, and after it was pa&s;t to a&s;cend again &s;o high, as to got over part of the Mountain, and a &s;tream of them pa&s;&s;ed through the hole out of <HI>Carniola</HI> into <HI>Carin|thia,</HI> oppo&s;itely unto us who pa&s;&s;ed out of <HI>Carinthia</HI> into <HI>Carniola,</HI> or out of <HI>Karnten</HI> into <HI>Craen.</HI></P>
<P>This noble pa&s;&s;age being already &s;o well contrived, and in the Country of a laborious and indu&s;trious people, is like to be continued, who remove the &s;now with great pains in the Winter, and keep the way pa&s;&s;able, and as we continually a&s;cended till we came to this <HI>Grotto,</HI> &s;o when we were once got through it we always de&s;cended, &amp; came fir&s;t to S. <HI>Anna,</HI> two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> miles downward, then to <HI>New&s;tuttel</HI> a <HI>German</HI> mile and half further &s;till de&s;cending, and proceeded forward till we came to <HI>Crainburg,</HI> which is thought to have been formerly <HI>Carnodunum,</HI> a good Town &s;eated upon the River <HI>Savus,</HI> from whence through a fair Plain four <HI>German</HI> miles long, we came to <HI>Labach</HI> or <HI>Lubiana</HI> the chief City of <HI>Carniola;</HI> the River <HI>Labach</HI> runs through it, which falls after|wards into the <HI>Savus.</HI> It is an hand&s;ome City with a Ca&s;tle &s;eated up|on an Hill which over-looks two large Valleys to the North and South, and hath a fair Pro&s;pect of many Hills and Ca&s;tles, but being commanded but another Hill not far from it, it is neglected, although we find that it hath endured a &s;trong Siege, for while the Emperor <HI>Fre|derick</HI> was receiving the Crown at <HI>Aken,</HI> his Brother <HI>Albertus</HI> and Count <HI>&V;lrick</HI> took the advantage to be&s;iege it, but it made &s;o good re|&s;i&s;tance that the Emperor had time to rai&s;e the Siege and de&s;troy the

Army. At <HI>Labach</HI> I happily met with Mr. <HI>To&s;h</HI> a <HI>Scotch</HI> Apothecary in that Town, who was very civil unto me, informing me of the places about, and &s;hewing me many Curio&s;ities, and the &s;everal Minerals of tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P>This place is conceived to be old <HI>Nauportus</HI> famous for the landing of the <HI>Argonautes,</HI> who &s;etting forth from <HI>Argos Pela&s;gicum</HI> in <HI>The&s;&s;a|ly</HI> &s;ailed unto <HI>Colchos</HI> on the Ea&s;t &s;ide of the <HI>Euxine Sea,</HI> but being pur&s;ued by the King of <HI>Colchos</HI> his Ve&s;&s;els di&s;patched after them, they declined returning by the <HI>Helle&s;pont,</HI> but bearing Northward entred the mouth of <HI>I&s;ter</HI> or <HI>Danubius,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ed up the River till they came to the concurrence of the <HI>Danubius</HI> and the <HI>Savus,</HI> and taking up the <HI>Savus</HI> they came to the River <HI>Labach,</HI> and went up that River landing about this place anciently called <HI>Nauportus,</HI> and then travelled to the <HI>Adriatick Sea</HI> and returned unto <HI>Greece.</HI> So that in my travels I had been near their &s;etting out in <HI>The&s;&s;aly,</HI> and at the place of their landing in <HI>Carniola.</HI></P>
<P>From hence we travelled towards the <HI>Zirchnitzer-See,</HI> or famous &s;trange Lake of <HI>Zirchnitz</HI> having the Mar&s;hes on our right, hand, and the Hills on our left till we came to <HI>Brounitza,</HI> and then pa&s;&s;ing over them we came to <HI>Zirchnitz,</HI> a Town of about three hundred Hou&s;es, which gives the name unto the Lake, here I applyed my &s;elf unto <HI>An|dreas Wifer</HI> the <HI>Richter</HI> or Judge of the Town who afforded me di|rections and accommodations for the viewing of the Lake; and went down to <HI>Seedorff,</HI> a Village half a mile nearer the Lake, and then to <HI>Ni|derdorff,</HI> where I took Boat and &s;pent &s;ome time upon the Lake.</P>
<P>This Lake is about two <HI>German</HI> miles long, and one broad, encom|pa&s;&s;ed with Hills at &s;ome di&s;tance, and upon the South-&s;ide lies a Fore&s;t part of <HI>Birnbaumer</HI> Fore&s;t, which extends a great way, where|in are many Dear, wild Boars, Foxes, Wolves and Bears.</P>
<P>Every year in &s;ome part of the Month of <HI>June,</HI> the water of this Lake de&s;cends under ground through many great holes at the bot|toms; and in the Month of <HI>September</HI> returns again by the &s;ame holes; and with a &s;peedy a&s;cent, &s;pringing and mounting up to the heighth of a Pike, and &s;oon covering that tract of ground again. When the water is under-ground, the Earth makes a &s;peedy production of of Gra&s;s yielding food for Cattel in the Winter, and at the &s;ame time, Hares, Deer and Boars re&s;ort to this place out of the Country, and the fore-mentioned Fore&s;t, and are often taken by the people.</P>
<P>The Lake affords plenty of Fi&s;h, but they fi&s;h but by permi&s;&s;ion, for the Prince of <HI>Eckenberg</HI> is Lord thereof, and a good part of the Country about, but upon the going away of the water, all have liber|ty to take Fi&s;h, which they do by &s;tanding in the water by the holes, and &s;o intercepting their pa&s;&s;age take great plenty of them, which o|therwi&s;e would follow the water under-ground, and not returns again until <HI>September.</HI> I could not hear that any unknown Fi&s;hes were brought up by the water, but tho&s;e which come up are of the &s;ame kind with tho&s;e which went down, which are a kind of Carp, Tench, Eels, and &s;uch as are common in other Lakes; and they are rather gainers than Loo&s;ers hereby, when they come up, for the Fi&s;h having &s;pawned before, the fry that goes down hath had about three months growth under ground when they are brought up again.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="50">
The Ground under the Lake is very unequal, and the water not near of the &s;ame depth, but in &s;ome places four foot, and then &s;uddenly again twenty yards deep: and becau&s;e the Fi&s;h frequent the Valleys or deep|er places, more than the Hills or eminent parts, the Fi&s;hermen who know the place wet and dry, have given unto &s;even of the&s;e Valleys peculiar names, which in the <HI>Sclavonian,</HI> the Language of that Coun|try, are the&s;e,</P>

<P>I pa&s;&s;ed over the five fir&s;t mentioned Valleys, and went to a noted Stone called the Fi&s;hers Stone, by the appearance whereof they can conjecture how &s;oon the water will de&s;cend, and by an Hill, which when the water is high becomes a plea&s;ant I&s;land, and then return|ed.</P>
<P>They can give no account that this Lake hath failed any year to de&s;cend and ari&s;e again, or have any tradition how long this property of the Lake hath been ob&s;erved. Some Lakes have been made by Earth-quakes, but it is more probable that this hath been from all Anti|quity, and according to the be&s;t conjectures, this is the <HI>Lugea Palus</HI> of <HI>Strabo,</HI> and therefore more &s;trange that the Ancients are &s;ilent in this remarkable account.</P>
<P>The neare&s;t Sea unto this Lake is the <HI>Sinus Terge&s;tinus,</HI> and <HI>Sinus Flanaticus,</HI> the Gulf of <HI>Trie&s;te,</HI> and the Gulf of <HI>Quevero.</HI> And not ma|ny miles from hence are the Heads of divers con&s;iderable Rivers, as that of <HI>Labach,</HI> the <HI>Corcoras</HI> or <HI>Gurk,</HI> the <HI>Colapis</HI> or <HI>Culp,</HI> which run into the <HI>Savus.</HI> The <HI>Vipao</HI> or <HI>amnis frigdus</HI> which runs into <HI>Ly|&s;on&s;o</HI> by <HI>Goritia,</HI> and divers more, but whither the&s;e Rivers ari&s;e where the Lake falls, I could not learn.</P>
<P>The Ground not far from this Lake is very hollow and full of Ca|verns, and I ob&s;erved many Caverns and deep holes in other parts of <HI>Carniola</HI> &s;omewhat like unto <HI>Elden</HI> hole in <HI>Darby&s;hire,</HI> and I was in|formed by the mo&s;t con&s;iderable per&s;ons at <HI>Zirchnitz</HI> that the Prince of <HI>Eckenberg</HI> had the curio&s;ity to go into one of them, and came out again upon the &s;ide of an Hill.</P>
<P>I was upon con&s;ideration whether I &s;hould go from hence unto <HI>Ter|ge&s;tum</HI> now <HI>Trie&s;te,</HI> a Port-Town of the Emperor's in the <HI>Adriatick-Sea,</HI> and then by Ship to <HI>Venice,</HI> but having been in many Mines be|fore I had a de&s;ire al&s;o to &s;ee the famous Quick &s;ilver Mine at <HI>Idria</HI> in the County of <HI>Goritia;</HI> and parting from <HI>Zirchnitz</HI> I pa&s;&s;ed by <HI>Lovecq,</HI> and travelled over Mountainous parts till I came to <HI>Idria,</HI> which is en|compa&s;&s;ed with Hills on all &s;ides, and a River of the &s;ame name runs by it, which although <HI>Leandro Alberti</HI> terms <HI>&s;uperbi&s;&s;imo fiume d'Idria,</HI> yet I found it &s;mall and &s;hallow at the time when I was there, upon plentiful rains how&s;oever it proves &s;ufficient to convey down the Firr|trees, and other wood required in the building of the Mines, and al&s;o
<PB N="82" REF="51">
for fuel nece&s;&s;ary in the &s;ervice of them; and to this end there is an hand&s;ome work of Piles made &s;lopeing a-thwart the River, (after the &s;ame manner as I ob&s;erved at <HI>New&s;ol</HI> in upper <HI>Hungary</HI> cro&s;s the River <HI>Gran)</HI> to &s;top the Trees which are cut down and ca&s;t into the River above this place.</P>
<P>What is chiefly con&s;iderable in this Town are the Quick-&s;ilver Mines, very well known to the neighbouring parts, and exceeding u&s;eful to many at greater di&s;tance.</P>
<P>The entrance into the&s;e Mines is not high or upon an Hill, but in the Town it &s;elf, whereby they are &s;omewhat the more troubled with water, again&s;t which they are provided with many excellent Engines and Devices, as at other deep Mines; the deepe&s;t part of the Mine from the entrance is between one hundred and twenty, and one hun|dred and thirty fathoms.</P>
<P>Of the Quick-&s;ilver of this Mine they have two &s;orts, the one call|ed <HI>Jungfraw,</HI> that is virgin Quick-&s;ilver, the other plain Quick-&s;ilver, virgin Mercury they call that which di&s;covers it &s;elf without the help of fire, and is either plainly to be &s;een in the Earth or Ore, or falls down in little drops in the Mine, and &s;ometimes &s;treams out in good quantity; as about &s;even years ago it ran out of the Earth at fir&s;t in a &s;tream as &s;mall as a thred, and afterwards as big as a Pack-thred, but ceas'd in three or four days.</P>
<P>That al&s;o is accounted virgin Quick-&s;ilver, which having no need to pa&s;s the fire, is &s;eparated by water fir&s;t in a Sieve, and afterwards in a long Trough, having very &s;mall holes at one end, &s;o that there is in a manner two &s;orts of Virgin Mercury; the one running out and di&s;|covering it &s;elf without labour, the other requiring &s;ome way of extra|ction and &s;eparation, though not &s;o high an one as by fire.</P>
<P>Plain Quick-&s;ilver they name that which is not at fir&s;t perceived by the eye, or falls from the Ore, but is forced out by fire, and this they obtain out of the Ore, or out of the natural Cinnabar of Mercury which they dig out of this Mine. The Ore is of a dark colour mixed with red, but the be&s;t is a hard Stone which they commit not pre&s;ently to the fire, but powder it gro&s;ly and work it by the &s;ieve, that &s;o if any Virgin Quick-&s;ilver be found in it, it may be &s;eparated in this manner, and what doth not pa&s;s the &s;ieve, may be &s;eparated by fire in Iron Fur|naces, fifty of them in a fire.</P>
<P>The Quick-&s;ilver-Ore of this Mine is the riche&s;t of all Ores I have yet &s;een, for ordinarily it contains in it half Quick-&s;ilver, and in two parts of Ore one part of Quick-&s;ilver, and &s;ometimes in three parts of Ore, two parts of Quick-&s;ilver.</P>
<P>I went into the Mine by the Pit of St. <HI>Agatha,</HI> and came up again by that of St. <HI>Barbara,</HI> de&s;cending and a&s;cending by Ladders; I a&s;cen|ded at one of &s;ix hundred and thirty nine &s;taves, or eighty nine fa|thoms. <HI>Si&s;erus</HI> in <HI>K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rcher</HI>'s <HI>Mundus &s;ubterraneus</HI> makes &s;uch a dread|ful de&s;cription of this Mine, that it might di&s;courage any from attempt|ing the de&s;cent, which makes me doubt, whether he had been in any other Mine, e&s;pecially where the de&s;cent is made by Ladders.</P>
<P>In a Laboratory, where the Quick-&s;ilver is &s;eparated by fire, I &s;aw an heap of &s;ixteen thou&s;and retorts of Iron, every one of which co&s;ts a Crown at the be&s;t hand from the Iron Furnaces in <HI>Carinthia:</HI> here|in are al&s;o at one time eight hundred retorts, and as many recipients

employed together in drawing over the Quick-&s;ilver in &s;ixteen Furna|ces, fifty in each Furnace, twenty five of a &s;ide, twelve above, and thirteen below of each &s;ide.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 12. 1669. When I was there they carried out forty &s;aumes of Quick-&s;ilver into Foreign parts, each &s;aume containing three hundred and fifteen pound weight to the value of four thou&s;and Ducats of Gold, though the conveyance be not ea&s;ie, for it is carried upon Hor&s;es backs, two &s;mall Barrels upon each Hor&s;e, yet &s;ome is &s;ent as far as <HI>Chremnitz</HI> in <HI>Hungary</HI> for the u&s;e of the Gold Mine, and &s;ome into <HI>Swe|den,</HI> and other remote parts.</P>
<P>In the Ca&s;tle I &s;aw three thou&s;and &s;aumes of Quick-&s;ilver together in Barrels&punc; the Quick-&s;ilver being fir&s;t made up in double Leather; and in another Hou&s;e as much rich Ore as can be de&s;tilled in two years, except they have great plenty of rain to bring down the wood, but the Hills being high about them, it &s;nows at the tops of them oftner than it rains.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Strangers who come into the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Idria,</HI> have their names &s;et down in a Regi&s;ter-Book, with the Country of which they are Na|tives, and the Catalogue is large, but of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> men there are few; of late years onely Mr. <HI>Evelyn</HI> and Dr. <HI>Pope,</HI> with their Company, of who&s;e ob&s;ervations there is an hand&s;ome account in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions &s;ome time &s;ince.

<P>Travelling in the night, we had &s;ometimes about us a great number of large Glow-worms, which put into papers gave a dim light; and in &s;ome places in the Plains the Air was full of flaming flies affording &s;ome delight to us.</P>
<P>The <HI>Carniolians</HI> &s;peak a Dialect of the <HI>Sclavonian,</HI> but in the&s;e parts they have a Language called <HI>Lingua Fullana,</HI> or <HI>Friulana;</HI> he that &s;peaketh <HI>Italian</HI> may under&s;tand much thereof.

If the Emperor, through who&s;e Countries the <HI>Turks</HI> mu&s;t pa&s;s to come to this place, and the Republick hold firm, it will be hard for the <HI>Turk</HI> to come unto it, and if the <HI>Turk</HI> &s;hould be at &s;uch a peace with the <HI>Vene|tians</HI> as may bind up their Fleet from a&s;&s;i&s;ting the other parts of <HI>Italy,</HI> he &s;hall not need to attempt it or make his way into <HI>Italy</HI> by that place, for whether the Naval Forces of <HI>Italy</HI> without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Venetians,</HI> be able to re&s;i&s;t a complete <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Fleet, &s;o as to hinder landing and falling upon that Country &s;ome other way, is much to be doubted.</P>
<P>From <HI>Palma nova</HI> I went to <HI>Maran</HI> St. <HI>Vito,</HI> a Port Town of the <HI>Ve|netians</HI> in <HI>Friuli,</HI> &s;o named from St. <HI>Vito,</HI> who is &s;aid to have been bu|ried in this place.</P>
<P>At this Town we took a <HI>Felluca,</HI> and &s;ayling by the &s;hoar of <HI>Friuli</HI> or <HI>Patria,</HI> we pa&s;&s;ed by <HI>Porto di Taiamento,</HI> and came to <HI>Cahorle.</HI> In this I&s;land there is a Church dedicated to the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin &s;eated up|on the Sea-&s;hoar nigh the Waves, yet &s;aid never to be overflowed by the Sea, being as it were the <HI>Halcyon</HI> Ne&s;t of its Patrone&s;s, and a place of remarkable devotion. On this &s;hoar we refre&s;hed our &s;elves and were diverti&s;ed at Sea in &s;eeing them take Shell-fi&s;h, and then pa&s;|&s;ing by <HI>Livenza,</HI> where the Sea came formerly up as high as <HI>Opitergium,</HI> and afterwards by <HI>Porto di Piave,</HI> I arrived at <HI>Venice</HI> entring by the <HI>Porto de Ca&s;telli</HI> pa&s;&s;ing by the <HI>Carthu&s;ians</HI> Convent, and landed at the <HI>Piazza</HI> of St. <HI>Mark.</HI></P>
<P>Here I found the whole City highly concerned for the <HI>Hazardous</HI> State of <HI>Candia,</HI> which was lo&s;t &s;oon after, <HI>Dominico Cantarini</HI> the pre|&s;ent Duke was &s;edulous in that affair.

<P>There was al&s;o a &s;upply of Auxiliaries in good readine&s;s; it was at that time a more than ordinary hot Sea&s;on, and &s;ome of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Sea Captains and Ma&s;ters told me, that they had &s;eldom met with &s;uch hot weather even between the <HI>Tropicks.</HI></P>

<P>The old Mens hou&s;e, or an Ho&s;pital for &s;ixty aged per&s;ons, is large and hand&s;ome; having a good Quadrangle and a Garden in it. The Ho&s;pital al&s;o for the &s;ick is very cleanly kept.</P>
<P>Here I fir&s;t &s;aw the manner of puni&s;hing Malefactors by whipping them with rods, which is more &s;evere than I imagined; they lead them to a Po&s;t upon a Scaffold, their hands tyed and by a Pully drawn up as high as can be extended, and then an Iron fa&s;tned about their wa&s;t to keep them &s;teady; in which &s;tretched-out po&s;ture they receive &s;ome|times fifty or &s;ixty &s;tripes or more, according to the merit of their of|fence.</P>
<P>Not far from this place there is a great Water, or noted Lake called <HI>Haerlem Meere</HI> about twenty Miles in length, which is frozen over in hard Winters, and men &s;wiftly travel over it by &s;liding or in &s;leds. When <HI>Haerlem</HI> was be&s;ieged there was a Naval fight upon it; The <HI>Dutch</HI> having about an hundred and fifty Ve&s;&s;els, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> not many fewer. The Town was afterwards taken by Compo&s;ition, but &s;uch Cruelty was u&s;ed by tho <HI>Spaniards</HI> that they have not yet forgot it <NOTE PLACE="marg">Am&s;terdam.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>From <HI>Haerlem</HI> I went to <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> a City at pre&s;ent for Riches, Trade, Shipping, fair Streets, and plea&s;ant habitations, &s;carce yielding to any other of the World. It is &s;eated upon the River <HI>Ye,</HI> and hath its name, as 'tis reported, from a Ca&s;tle appertaining long &s;ince to the Lords of <HI>Amstel,</HI> to whom this place al&s;o belonged: At the begin|ning, the &s;eat of a few Fi&s;hermen; but afterwards increa&s;ing, it re|ceived many Priviledges from the Counts of <HI>Holland,</HI> and was made a Town or City by the favour of their Grants and Charters. In the year 1470. it was walled about with a Brick-wall, to defend it again&s;t the Citizens of <HI>&V;trecht,</HI> they having been in great danger to have fallen in|to their hands, if tho&s;e of <HI>&V;trecht</HI> had pur&s;ued their Victories. In few Months after al&s;o, the whole Town was almo&s;t reduced to A&s;hes by fire, but by the increa&s;e of their Traffick they ea&s;ily overcame their lo&s;&s;es, waded through all difficulties, and rendred good Services to their Counts, and received the honour afterwards from <HI>Maximilian</HI> the Emperor to have the Imperial Crown over their Armes, which ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> three <HI>Cro&s;&s;es</HI> on a <HI>Pale.</HI></P>
<P>About the year 1525. <HI>Gelen,</HI> &s;ent from the new King of <HI>Munster,</HI> pa&s;&s;ed through <HI>Frie&s;land</HI> and came to this City; where having made a

Party, and communicated his de&s;ign, he re&s;olved to &s;urprize the Town by night, at the time of the &s;ounding of the Bell; to which intent they were already entred the Market place, had &s;et upon the Town|hou&s;e: and cut in pieces tho&s;e who re&s;i&s;ted them. When by great providence the rope to the great Bell was taken away; the Magi|&s;trates had notice of it, and cau&s;ed all the Streets and Avenues leading to the Market-place to be &s;topped up with Wool-&s;acks and Hop-&s;acks, whereby they were hindred in their de&s;ign of taking the Town by night, and the next morning their number being di&s;covered to be in|con&s;iderable, they were &s;et upon, driven into the <HI>Stadthuis,</HI> and de|feated.</P>
<P>Of late years this City is mightily encrea&s;ed and encompa&s;&s;ed with a new Wall, and fortified after the modern way. The new Streets are large and uniform: and the whole Town being in a low Mar&s;hy ground, the water is let in through all the con&s;iderable Streets. The River <HI>Am&s;tel</HI> pa&s;&s;es through the City, being let in under a hand&s;ome well contrived Bridge of Eleven Arches, which is &s;o built as to make part of the Wall and Rampart, and is 26 paces broad. The whole Town is built upon Piles, or high Firr-trees, driven down perpendicu|larly into the Earth &s;o thick together, that nothing more can be forced in between them: And by this means they build Hou&s;es in the Sea, and lay Foundations &s;trong enough to &s;upport the geate&s;t Buildings what&s;oever, in places where no &s;olid bottom is to be found. But they mu&s;t needs be at a great expence and labour before they can lay the fir&s;t Stone: And the number of Trees required to each Foundation is con&s;iderable; &s;ince for the Foundation of one Tower or Steeple alone, over again&s;t the Church of St. <HI>Katherine,</HI> Mr. <HI>J. de Parivall,</HI> who wrote <HI>Les Delices de la Hollande,</HI> reckons that there was rammed into the ground a <HI>Fore&s;t,</HI> as he calls it, of Six thou&s;and three hundred and thirty four great Trees. About this manner of work, for the fix|ing their Foundations, I &s;aw them employed in divers places, parti|cularly at the <HI>Ea&s;t-India-hou&s;e</HI> and at a place where a <HI>Lutheran</HI> Church was then de&s;igned to be built, So that it was not improbably &s;aid, <HI>That if a man could &s;ee all under this City, he could hardly behold a greater Fore&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Stadthuis</HI> or <HI>Town-hou&s;e,</HI> is the noble&s;t Building in all the&s;e Countries. A Pile of Free&s;tone of an hundred and ten paces in Front, being larger than the Magnified Front of the Church of St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s at <HI>Rome,</HI> and eighty one paces deep, or on the &s;ides. The Chambers in it, the Pictures and Statues, are worthy to be &s;een and admired. The fir&s;t Room on the right hand, or <HI>Judgment-hall,</HI> where the Malefactors receive their Sentence, is adorned with large Statues, hanging down their heads in mournful po&s;tures, as if concerned or grieving at what was then pronounced. The Floors are of Marble; the Roofs are rich|ly gilt and painted. Upon the top of all &s;tands <HI>Atlas</HI> or <HI>Columbus,</HI> holding a Globe upon his Shoulder made of Copper, of about ten foot Diameter, which is as large perhaps as any Ball or Globe what&s;oever employed to this ornamental u&s;e. That upon St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s at <HI>Rome,</HI> as having been in it, I judge to be le&s;s; as likewi&s;e that at <HI>Florence.</HI> The <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Ornament to the Tower of their <HI>Mo&s;ques,</HI> is three Balls one above another, and an half Moon over them, but they are le&s;s by far, at lea&s;t &s;uch as I have &s;een: and by relation from Eye-witne&s;&s;es, the
<PB N="97" REF="58">
large&s;t of the three noble gilded Balls at <HI>Morocco</HI> are inferiour to this. But I will &s;ay nothing more of this great building, the <HI>Stadthuis,</HI> &s;ince there is a peculiar de&s;cription of it in Folio, with Cuts and Figures of the mo&s;t remarkable Curio&s;ities in it. The <HI>Exchange</HI> is fair and large, and above it are Shops: it is very well frequented, and he that comes after twelve payeth &s;ix &s;tivers.</P>
<P>Divers of their Churches are fair: In the new Church, the partition with Balli&s;ters of Bra&s;s, and the carved Pulpit, are noble. In the old Church the Tomb of <HI>Van H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">l&s;e</HI> and <HI>Heemskerk</HI> are remarkable. <HI>Heemskerk</HI> did his Country great Services in their fir&s;t attempts upon <HI>India:</HI> for the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> having confi&s;cated &s;ome of the <HI>Hollan|ders</HI> Ships, who traded to his Dominions, which were then the Staple for the <HI>India</HI> Trade, It was re&s;olved by the permi&s;&s;ion of Prince <HI>Mau|rice</HI> and the States, to &s;et out a Fle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t of eight Ships for the <HI>Indies;</HI> four of which were to pa&s;s by the way of the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean, and the Cape of <HI>Good-hope:</HI> And the other four were to &s;earch a pa&s;&s;age towards the Kingdoms of <HI>Cathay</HI> and <HI>China</HI> by the North-ea&s;t, whereby the pa&s;&s;age al&s;o into tho&s;e parts might be expected much &s;horter than that which was known to the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>To this intent the&s;e four la&s;t ve&s;&s;els &s;ailed out of the <HI>Texel. June</HI> 5. 1594. and returned in <HI>September,</HI> not being able to proceed by rea&s;on of the Ice. But upon the relation of the Voyage by <HI>William Baren&s;on,</HI> there were two other Expeditions afterwards to <HI>Nova Zembla;</HI> in the la&s;t of which they wintered there, and <HI>Baren&s;on</HI> lo&s;t his life. <HI>Heems|kerk</HI> was the chief of the twelve which returned from that cold habita|tion, where none but Bears and Foxes could well endure the Winter, where he had been twice, and afterwards made two rich Voyages into <HI>India.</HI> Upon who&s;e happy returns the <HI>Holland Ea&s;t India</HI> Company was fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed, and a prohibition m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">de for any other of that Coun|try to trade thither for the &s;pace of One and twenty years.</P>
<P>But to proceed to other publick Buildings in this City. The <HI>Tuch|thuis</HI> or <HI>Ra&s;pelhuis,</HI> or Hou&s;e of Correction for debauched young men, &s;uch as are incorrigible and di&s;obedient to Parents or Laws, hath at the entrance of the Gate two Lions bridled, a proper Emblem, with this In&s;cription, <HI>Virtutis e&s;t domare quae cuncti pavent.</HI> This was formerly a Mona&s;tery belonging to the Nuns of the Order of St. <HI>Clare,</HI> and con|verted to this u&s;e 1595. They who are put in, are forced to work and gain their Bread with hard labour. I &s;aw tho&s;e who ra&s;ped <HI>Brazil,</HI> having a certain task &s;et them every day, work &s;o hard, that being naked and in a &s;weat, and the du&s;t of the <HI>Brazil</HI> wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d flying upon them, they were all over painted of a beautiful red colour. Which odd &s;ight made me call to mind the Fancy of my Lady Marchione&s;s of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> of a Nation wherein the People were of Orange-tawny co|lour, and the King of Purple.</P>
<P>They told us that &s;ome that were committed to their charge, and not to be brought to work by blows, they placed in a large Ci&s;tern, and let the water in upon them, placing only a Pump by them for their relief, whereby they are forced to labour for their lives, and to free them&s;elves from drowning. One we &s;aw put into a narrow Dungeon, and kept from meat. Some are put into this Hou&s;e for a longer time, &s;ome for a &s;horter. It hath been a puni&s;hment for &s;uch as have drawn their Daggers, or offered to &s;tab any one. And &s;ome Citizens, though
<PB N="98" REF="59">

<P>This way of Correction may &s;eem &s;evere to many, yet is not com|parable to that which is &s;aid to have been formerly u&s;ed in <HI>Germany.</HI> Particularly at <HI>Colen,</HI> in the <HI>White Tower,</HI> at the North end of the Town, near the <HI>Rhine;</HI> where it is reported, that &s;uch Youths, who were not otherwi&s;e to be reclaimed, were in a barbarous manner &s;hut up in the <HI>White Tower.</HI> The height and thickne&s;s of the Walls &s;ecured them from e&s;caping, or from their complaints being heard. Near the top was placed out of their reach a loaf of bread, the la&s;t remedy again&s;t &s;tar|ving, which while their bold nece&s;&s;ity forced them to reach at, they exe|cuted their la&s;t &s;entence upon them&s;elves, and mi&s;erably brake their own necks.</P>
<P>Somewhat like the <HI>Ra&s;pelhuis</HI> is the <HI>Spinbuis,</HI> or Hou&s;e of Correcti|on, for the young women, who live loo&s;ely, are taken in the night, or can give no account of their living. They are put in for a certain time, according as their fault merits, and are bound to make lace, &s;ew, or employ their time perpetually in &s;ome hone&s;t labour.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e of the better &s;ort are permitted to have Chambers apart. In one large Room I &s;aw about an hundred of them, and &s;ome very well dre&s;&s;ed and fine, which was an unexpected &s;ight to me, and would &s;ure be more &s;trange to behold in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Wee&s;huis,</HI> or Ho&s;pital for Children, where there are Six hun|dred Orphans carefully looked after, and well educated.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dolhuis,</HI> or a Hou&s;e for &s;uch as are Delirious, Maniacal, or Me|lancholical of both Sexes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ga&s;thuis,</HI> or Ho&s;pital for the Sick, being large, and hath a great Revenue.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mannenhuis,</HI> or Ho&s;pital for old Men, and &s;uch as are no longer able to labour towards their own &s;upport.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides all which, there are great Sums of money collected for the poor, &s;o that there is not a Beggar to be &s;een in the Streets, and upon all a&s;&s;ignations or appointments of meeting at the Tavern, or el&s;ewhere, and upon many other occa&s;ions, who&s;oever fails to come at the exact time, forfeits more or le&s;s to the u&s;e of the Poor.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ea&s;t-India-hou&s;es</HI> are remarkable, and the great Stores of their Commodities, <HI>Cinnamon, Green-ginger, Camphire, Pepper, Calecuts, Indi|co,</HI> &amp;c. The Ships are of a great burden: their Hou&s;e was then en|larging, although it was great before; and a perfect Town for all Trades within it &s;elf.</P>
<P>The <HI>Admiralteyt,</HI> or Admiralty where their Stores for War and Shipping are laid up, is encompa&s;&s;ed with water; near to it there lay then 72 Men of War. In the Hou&s;e we &s;aw their Cables, Grapling|irons, Pullies, Oars, Charges for Powder, Lanthorns for Ships, &amp;c. At the entrance of the Gate hangs up a <HI>Canoe</HI> which &s;eems to have a man in it, dryed up, &s;o as to be pre&s;erved from corruption, and a Paddle in his hand: enclo&s;ed up to the wa&s;t in the <HI>Canoe,</HI> in &s;uch &s;ort, as the Fi&s;h-skins, which were the cover to it, being &s;o &s;ewed together that no water could get in, he might keep the Sea in the greate&s;t Storms without danger. The top of this Hou&s;e, as of divers others al&s;o in this

<P>The faire&s;t Streets in the Town are <HI>Harlem-&s;treet,</HI> the <HI>Cingel, Prin|ces Graft, Kai&s;ers Graft,</HI> and the New Buildings in the I&s;land towards <HI>Gottenburg.</HI> And if they continue to build with Free&s;tone, they will &s;till &s;urpa&s;s the&s;e, which, I'll a&s;&s;ure you, are in no &s;mall mea&s;ure beau|tiful.</P>
<P>I &s;aw a Globe to be &s;old, made by <HI>Vingbomes,</HI> between &s;ix and &s;even foot Diameter, valued at Sixteen thou&s;and Guldens: The Meridian a|lone, being of bra&s;s, co&s;t a thou&s;and Guldens. The Globe is made of Copper-plates excellently well painted, with all the new Di&s;coveries in it, as that of <HI>Anthony Van Dimons</HI> Land, found out 1642. in 42 degrees of Southern Latitude, and 170 of Longitude, tho&s;e towards the North-we&s;t of <HI>Japan,</HI> and tho&s;e places both about <HI>Nova Zembla,</HI> and al&s;o in the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Sea beyond the Streights of <HI>Voygats, New-Holland, We&s;t-Frie&s;land, Cape d' Hyver,</HI> &amp;c. but I have &s;ince met with a Book, which doth &s;omewhat contradict this; entituled <HI>A Voyage into the Northern Countries by Mon&s;ieur</HI> Martiniere, who went in one of the three Ships belonging to the Northern Company of <HI>Copenhagen,</HI> in the year 1653. and by that means had occa&s;ion to conver&s;e with the <HI>Norwegians, I&s;lan|ders, Laplanders, Kilops, Borandians, Siberians, Zemblians,</HI> and <HI>Samo|jedes,</HI> who are Neighbours to the <HI>Tartars</HI> and <HI>Tingor&s;es,</HI> in his 46 Chap|ter he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf after this manner. There having fallen into my hands &s;everal Geographical Charts of &s;undry eminent and much celebrated Authors, I am much amazed to &s;ee how they are mi&s;taken in the po&s;ition of <HI>Zembla,</HI> which they place much nearer the North Pole than really it is; they divide it likewi&s;e by the Sea from <HI>Green|land,</HI> and place it far di&s;tant from it, when as indeed tho&s;e two Coun|tries are Contiguous, the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Greenland</HI> butting upon the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Zembla,</HI> &s;o as did not the great quantity of Snow, and the violence of the cold render tho&s;e Borders uninhabitable, the pa&s;&s;age would be very ea&s;ie by Land from <HI>Greenland</HI> to <HI>Zembla</HI> and from <HI>Zembla</HI> pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Pater-no&s;ter</HI> Mountains to enter into <HI>Samojedia,</HI> from thence into <HI>Tartary</HI> or <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> as one plea&s;ed: I was amazed likewi&s;e to &s;ee they had de&s;cribed the Streight called <HI>Voygat,</HI> not above ten French Leagues in length, whereas it contains above five and thirty Dutch Leagues, which is &s;ix times as much. Again, they would per&s;wade us that through that Streight our &s;hips might pa&s;s into the great <HI>Tartarian</HI> Ocean, which is a mi&s;take. And although they indeed do affirm that in the time of Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> of <HI>Na&s;&s;aw,</HI> a Dutch Ve&s;&s;el pa&s;&s;ed that way into that Ocean, yet it is a manife&s;t error, that Streight being bounded, as I &s;aid before, by the <HI>Pater-no&s;ter</HI> Mountains, which are half a League high, and the tops of them covered with perpetual Snow, which never di&s;&s;olves. And of this I can give a po&s;itive te&s;timony, ha|ving been my &s;elf in that Streight under tho&s;e Mountains in the Dog|days, which is the hotte&s;t time of the year.</P>
<P>From the Steeple of the old Church of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> I had a good Pro&s;pect of the Town, and the great number of Ships lying upon one &s;ide of it, like a Wood; and all the Towns about it. The Roofs of the Hou&s;es being &s;harp, it is a mo&s;t uneven Town to be looked upon down|ward, as it is a hand&s;ome one to be looked on upward; and is not &s;o diver|ti&s;ing or plea&s;ing to the &s;ight, as &s;ome Towns in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> which
<PB N="100" REF="60">
have flatter Roofs, or el&s;e are covered with a fine black Slat or Ardoi&s;e. Upon this, and all other Towers of the Town, a Trumpet is &s;ounded at Midnight, and in other parts of the City at &s;ix a Clock night and morning. At eleven a Clock, the time of going on to the <HI>Exchange,</HI> there is good Mu&s;ick at the <HI>Stadthuis,</HI> given by the Earl of <HI>Leice&s;ter.</HI> They make good Harmony al&s;o every hour in playing upon their Chimes and Bells in mo&s;t Steeples. And there is a Mu&s;ick-hou&s;e or Entertaining-hou&s;e, where any one is admitted for a Stiver, hears mo&s;t &s;orts of Mu&s;ick, &s;ees many good Water-works, and divers motions by Clock-work, Pictures, and other Diverti&s;ements.</P>
<P>During my &s;tay at <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> I had the opportunity of &s;eeing di|vers Learned Men, and Per&s;ons of Note. Dr. <HI>Rui&s;h</HI> &s;hewed us many Curio&s;ities in Anatomy, as the <HI>Skeletons</HI> of young Children, and <HI>Faetus's</HI> of all Ages, neatly &s;et together, and very white; the <HI>Lymphatick ve&s;|&s;els</HI> &s;o pre&s;erved, as to &s;ee the <HI>valves</HI> in them. A Liver excarnated, &s;howing the Minute ve&s;&s;els, all &s;hining and clear. The Mu&s;cles of Chil|dren di&s;&s;ected and kept from corruption: entire Bodies pre&s;erved; the face of one was very remarkable, without the lea&s;t &s;pot or change of colour or alteration of the lineaments, from what might be expected immediately after death: he had then kept it two years, and hoped it would &s;o continue. Dr. <HI>Swammerdam</HI> &s;hewed us divers of his Ex|periments which he hath &s;et down in his Treati&s;e <HI>De Re&s;piratione;</HI> and a very &s;air Collection of In&s;ects brought from &s;everal Countries; a <HI>Stagg-fly</HI> of a very great bigne&s;s; an <HI>Indian Scolopendria,</HI> or <HI>Forty-foot;</HI> a fly called <HI>Ephemeron,</HI> and many other Curio&s;ities. Old <HI>Glawber</HI> the Chymi&s;t &s;hewed us his Laboratory: And we received much civility from <HI>Bla&s;ius</HI> the Phy&s;ick Profe&s;&s;our who hath wrote a Comment upon <HI>Ve&s;lingius.</HI></P>
<P>The Jews live more hand&s;omly and &s;plendidly here, than in any other place: Their chief Synagogue is large, adorned with Lamps of Bra&s;s and Silver. We happened to be there at the Fea&s;t of their <HI>New|year;</HI> &s;o that there blowing of Horns, &s;houting and &s;inging was not omitted: Some of them under&s;tand divers Languages. I &s;aw one <HI>Mo&s;es di Pas,</HI> a Learned young Man, and <HI>Orobio,</HI> a Phy&s;ician of Note. And I was &s;orry to &s;ee divers here to profe&s;s them&s;elves publickly Jews, who had lived at lea&s;t reputed Chri&s;tians, for a long time in other places: One who had been a <HI>Franci&s;can</HI> Friar thirty years; and ano|ther who had been Profe&s;&s;our &s;ome years at <HI>Tholouze,</HI> and before that Phy&s;ician to the King of <HI>Spain. Juda Leo,</HI> a Jew, hath taken great pains in making a Model of the Temple of <HI>Solomon,</HI> of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Hou&s;e, the Fort of the Temple, the Tabernacle, the I&s;raelites encamping, and other Curio&s;ities. I was pre&s;ent at the Circumci&s;ion of a Child; which is performed by thru&s;ting a Probe in between the <HI>Glans</HI> and <HI>Praeputi|um,</HI> and &s;eparating it, or dilating the <HI>Praeputium,</HI> &s;o as the inward Skin may be drawn forward as well as the outward; then by applying an In&s;trument joynted like a Carpenters Rule, or a Sector, the Skin is held fa&s;t beyond the <HI>Glans,</HI> and with a broad Inci&s;ion-knife, or Cir|cumci&s;ion-knife, the Foreskin is cut off clo&s;e to the In&s;trument; and what remains of Skin is immediately put back, the blood &s;topped with Powders, and a Plai&s;ter applyed; the Relations and Acquain|tance &s;inging all the while, whereby the cries of the Infant are le&s;s heard.</P>

Leaving <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> I pa&s;&s;ed by a peculiar Burial-place of the Jews, who are not permitted to interr their dead within the Walls&punc; by <HI>Overs|kerk, Bamburg,</HI> and in &s;ix or &s;even hours arrived at <HI>&V;tretcht,</HI> in a Boat drawn with Hor&s;es through artificial Cuts of Water, which is the way of Travelling in <HI>Holland, &V;tretcht,</HI> and divers other Provinces of the <HI>Low-Countries.</HI></P>
<P><HI>&V;trecht</HI> is an ancient, large, hand&s;ome City, and chief of the Pro|vince<NOTE PLACE="marg">&V;trecht.</NOTE> of the &s;ame name, called formerly <HI>Antonina,</HI> and afterwards <HI>&V;l|trajectum.</HI> Long famous for its Epi&s;copal See founded by <HI>Dagobert,</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> who endowed it richly with Lands and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions: <HI>Willebald,</HI> or <HI>Willebrode,</HI> an Engli&s;hman, was their fir&s;t Bi&s;hop, who converted the&s;e Countries unto Chri&s;tianity; and the following Bi|&s;hops grew &s;o powerful, that they were able to bring many thou&s;and men into the field, and to wage great Wars again&s;t the Counts of <HI>Hol|land:</HI> Their Succe&s;&s;ion al&s;o continued for above Nine hundred years. It is now an Univer&s;ity, founded by the States in the Year 1639. I &s;hall not trouble you with the Names of the Profe&s;&s;ors; the Learned Mr. <HI>Ray,</HI> whom I had the honour to meet in divers places abroad, having already cau&s;ed to be printed the <HI>Series Lectionum</HI> of this and many o|ther Univer&s;ities in the <HI>Low-Countries, Germany,</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> in his <HI>Ob|&s;ervations Topographical, Moral, Phy&s;iological,</HI> &s;et forth 1673. The great Church hath a very high Tower, or three Steeples one above ano|ther: From the highe&s;t of which I had not only a good &s;ight of the Town it &s;elf, which lay under mine Eye like a Platform, but of many others al&s;o; <HI>&V;tretcht</HI> being in a plain &s;lat Country, and &s;o well &s;eated, and encompa&s;&s;ed with &s;o populous a Country, that in a days Journey a man may go from hence to any one of fifty walled Towns and Ci|ties. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Church here is an ancient Building; the Pillar in the middle of it, who&s;e Foundation could not be laid but upon Bulls|hides, is much taken notice of: It was built 1099. and hath the Picture of a Bull upon it with this In&s;cription;
<Q><L>Accipe Po&s;teritas quod per tua &s;aecula narres,</L>
<L>Taurinis cutibus fundo &s;olidata columna e&s;t.</L></Q></P>
<P>There is an old Library belonging to this Church, which contains divers old Books and Manu&s;cripts. A large Bille in &s;ix Volumes, painted and gilded after a very ancient manner: Two Idols, taken (in time of War) long &s;ince in <HI>Germany,</HI> and given to this place by the Emperor <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth, are worth the &s;eeing, not &s;o much for their neatne&s;s, as their Antiquity and odd &s;hape: As al&s;o a Horn made out of a Tooth, &s;aid to be given at the &s;ame time. There are al&s;o three <HI>&V;nicorns</HI> Horns, little differing in length; the longe&s;t being five foot and an half: I drank out of one of them, the end being tipp'd with Silver, and made hollow to &s;erve for a Cup. The&s;e were of the <HI>Sea-&V;nicorn,</HI> or the Horn or long wreathed Tooth of &s;ome Sea-Animal much like it, taken in the Northern Sea; of which I have &s;een many, both in Publick Repo&s;itories, and in Private Hands. Two &s;uch as the&s;e, the one Ten foot long, were pre&s;ented not many years &s;ince to the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> being taken near to <HI>Nova Zembla;</HI> and I have &s;een &s;ome full fifteen foot long; &s;ome wreathed very thick, &s;ome not &s;o much, and others almo&s;t plain: Some large&s;t and thicke&s;t at the
<PB N="102" REF="61">
End near the head; others are large&s;t at &s;ome di&s;tance from the Head: Some very &s;harp at the end or point, and others blunt. My honoured Father Sir <HI>Thomas Brown</HI> had a very fair piece of one which was for|merly among the Duke of <HI>Curland</HI>'s Rarities, but after that he was ta|ken Pri&s;oner by <HI>Douglas</HI> in the Wars between <HI>Sweden</HI> and <HI>Poland,</HI> it came into the hands of my Unckle Colonel <HI>Hatcher,</HI> of whom my Fa|ther had it, he had al&s;o a piece of this &s;ort of <HI>&V;nicorns</HI> Horn burnt black, out of the Emperor of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI>'s <HI>Repo&s;itorie,</HI> given him by Dr. <HI>Ar|thur Dee,</HI> who was Son to Dr. <HI>John Dee,</HI> and al&s;o Phy&s;ician to the Emperor of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> when his Chambers were burned, in which he pre|&s;erved his Curio&s;ities. I have &s;een a walking Staff, a Scepter, a Scab|bard for a Sword, Boxes, and other Curio&s;ities made out of this Horn, but was never &s;o fortunate as from experience to confirm its Medical Efficacy again&s;t I oi&s;ons, contagious Di&s;ea&s;es, or any other evident ef|fect of it, although I have known it given &s;everal times, and in great quantity, Mr. <HI>Charlton</HI> hath a good <HI>&V;nicorns</HI> Horn, Sir <HI>Jo&s;eph William|&s;on</HI> gave one of them to the Royal Society. The Duke of <HI>Florence</HI> hath a fair one. The Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> a &s;trange one, and be&s;ides many o|thers, I &s;aw eight of them together upon one Table in the Emperors trea&s;ure, and I have one at pre&s;ent that for the neat wreathing and Elegant &s;hape gives place to none. But of the&s;e <HI>&V;nicorns</HI> Horns no man &s;ure hath &s;o great a Collection as the King of <HI>Denmark;</HI> and his Father had &s;o many, that he was able to &s;pare a great number of them, to build a Magnificent Throne out of <HI>&V;nicorns</HI> Horns.</P>

<P>This Town is al&s;o beautified with a fair Piazza or Market-place, di|vers long Streets, and a <HI>Pall-mall</HI> with five rows of Trees on each &s;ide.

They have &s;ome Out-works, as Half-moons and Ravelins, but their be&s;t &s;ecurity is in the great number of men which they are able to rai&s;e within them|&s;elves.

<P>It received the Chri&s;tian Faith very early, and <HI>Maternus</HI> was their Bi&s;hop above 1350 years &s;ince, who &s;ub&s;cribed, among&s;t others, to the Council of <HI>Arles.</HI> They have a great number of Churches, and well endowed, which take up a great part of the Town; the Prebends and Canons Hou&s;es having in many places Vincyards, and large Gardens adjoyning.

<P>From <HI>Mentz</HI> I pa&s;&s;ed by water up the River <HI>Main,</HI> to <HI>Franckfort,</HI> a free City of the Empire, called <HI>Trajectum Franconum,</HI> a Pa&s;&s;age or Ford of the <HI>Franks,</HI> as &s;erving them for a Retreat, when they entred or re|turned from <HI>Gaul;</HI> at pre&s;ent <HI>Franckford</HI> upon the <HI>Main,</HI> to difference it from <HI>Franckford</HI> upon the River <HI>Oder,</HI> which is an Univer&s;ity: It is a large Town, divided into two parts by the River; the le&s;&s;er called <HI>Saxonhau&s;en,</HI> or <HI>Saxon-hou&s;es,</HI> united to the other by a Stone-bridge over the <HI>Main,</HI> of twelve or thirteen Arches. It is a place of good Trade, and well &s;eated for it, as having the advantage of the River <HI>Main,</HI> which pa&s;&s;es by <HI>Bamberg, Schweinfurt, Wurtzburg, Guemund,</HI> or <HI>Gaudia mundi;</HI> and al&s;o the <HI>Tauber,</HI> and other Rivers running into it, af|fords conveniency for Commerce with the remoter parts of <HI>Franconia;</HI> and the <HI>Main</HI> running into the <HI>Rhine,</HI> makes a large communication both up and down that Stream.</P>
<P>But this place is mo&s;t remarkable for the Election of the Emperor, which, by the Laws of the <HI>G lden Bull,</HI> &s;hould be in this City, as al&s;o for two great Marts or Fairs kept in <HI>March</HI> and <HI>September;</HI> at which times there is an extraordinary concour&s;e of people from remote parts, in order to buying and &s;elling of &s;everal Commodities, e&s;pecially for Books, as well printed here as in other parts, whereof they afford two Catalogues every year, and have no &s;mall dealings that way, by the Factors of the <HI>Germans, Hollanders, Italians, French,</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h:</HI> al|though at other times their trading in Books &s;eems not great; for when I was there out of the time of the Mart, the <HI>Stationers</HI> Shops being &s;hut up, made but a dull &s;how. Here are al&s;o a great number of good Hor&s;es bought and &s;old: and on the North-&s;ide of the City there is a &s;pacious place for a Hor&s;e-Fair. The City is &s;trong and well fortified; and mo&s;t part of the Town are <HI>Lutherans.</HI> In the <HI>German</HI> Wars, the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> having taken <HI>Hanaw,</HI> &s;ent a Me&s;&s;enger to <HI>Franckfort</HI> to know whether the City would peaceably and &s;peedily &s;et open their Gates unto him, and accept fairly of a Garri&s;on, or &s;tand to the hazard of a Siege: And although they were unwilling to yield, yet for fear of the wor&s;t, they con&s;ented, That the King &s;hould have free pa&s;&s;age for his Army through the City; and that for the better a&s;|&s;urance of it, &s;ix hundred of his men &s;hould be received for a Garri&s;on into <HI>Saxonhau&s;en;</HI> and al&s;o that the Magi&s;trates and People &s;hould take

an Oath unto his Maje&s;ty. So that upon the 17<HI>th</HI> of <HI>November,</HI> 1631. the King's Army pa&s;&s;ed through <HI>Saxonhau&s;en</HI> over the Bridge, quite through the Town. Colonel <HI>Vitzthumb</HI> was left Governour in <HI>Saxon|hau&s;en;</HI> and the King him&s;elf rode bare headed through the Streets: and by his obliging behaviour did generally win the affections of the beholders; and three days after returned thither again with the <HI>Landt|grave</HI> of <HI>He&s;&s;en-Ca&s;&s;ell,</HI> and the <HI>Landtgrave</HI> of <HI>He&s;&s;en-Darm&s;tadt,</HI> where they met the Seventeen Earls of the <HI>Wetteraw,</HI> or <HI>Veteravia,</HI> and were fea&s;ted in the &s;ame room where the Emperors at their Coronation u&s;e to be entertained.</P>
<P>In <HI>Saxonhau&s;en</HI> there is a Hou&s;e anciently belonging unto the Knights of the <HI>Teutonick</HI> Order, which hath the privilege of a Sanctuary for Man-&s;layers and Bankrupts; but it is a &s;ecurity but for fourteen days. Upon this &s;ide th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">re is the large&s;t portion of Land belonging to <HI>Franck|fort;</HI> on the other &s;ide very little.</P>
<P>This being a trading place, it is no wonder that there are &s;o many Jews in it; for a di&s;tinction they wear great Ruffs, their Sons Bonnets, and their Wives a peculiar dre&s;s of their Head.</P>
<P>The Collegiate Church of St. <HI>Bartholomew,</HI> where many of the Em|perors have been crowned, is large, hath a high Steeple, and is built of a red &s;tone. There are divers hand&s;ome Fountains in the Town, and good Hou&s;es; in one of the be&s;t of which live Mon&s;ieur <HI>Pierre Neuf|ville,</HI> a great Merchant, and a civil worthy per&s;on well known in mo&s;t places of Commerce; who obliged me with Letters to <HI>Venice,</HI> and other places. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Darm&s;tadt.</NOTE></P>

<P>In coming into this Town we pa&s;&s;ed over the River <HI>Neccar, Nicer,</HI> or <HI>Necarus,</HI> upon a Bridge covered over from one end to another, with a large Roof of Wood: in the &s;ame manner is the long Bridge covered at the entrance of the City of <HI>Ale&s;&s;andria della paglia</HI> in <HI>Italy.</HI></P>

that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had taken this Town 1620. was carried to <HI>Rome,</HI> and added to the <HI>Vatican,</HI> where I &s;aw it in the year 1664. being pla|ced upon one &s;ide of a very long Gallery belonging to the <HI>Vatican</HI> Li|brary; and the Duke of <HI>&V;rbin</HI>'s Library placed on the other&s;ide, over again&s;t it: both which made a notable addition to the Papal Library. In this Church and the Church al&s;o of <HI>St. Peter,</HI> are divers Monu|ments of Princes of the <HI>Palatine</HI> Family, and of Learned and Famous Men. The <HI>French</HI> have a Church here, and the pre&s;ent Elector is of the Order of the <HI>Holy-Gho&s;t;</HI> and his Son a Mare&s;chal of <HI>France:</HI> and good <HI>French</HI> and <HI>High-dutch</HI> are both generally &s;poken here.

<P>Upon the Town-hou&s;e is a Clock with divers Motions, and when the Clock &s;trikes, the figure of an Old man pulls off his hat, a Cock crows, and &s;hakes his wings, Souldiers fight with one another, and the like. The Prince's Stables for above a hundred Hor&s;es are &s;eated upon the River very conveniently, but were fairer formerly, above half thereof having been ruined by the Imperali&s;ts; as al&s;o divers of the Statues on the out-&s;ide of the Ca&s;tle, which is &s;eated high above the Town.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Elector is <HI>Carolus Ludovicus,</HI> Son to the King of <HI>Bohe|mia, Frederick</HI> the Fifth; he was born in the year 1617. and pa&s;&s;ed his Youth an Exile from his Fathers Kingdom and Electorate: and at the pacification, at <HI>Prague</HI> 1635. he was excluded from any re&s;titution to be made to him. But at length in the Treaty of <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> 1648. he was re&s;tored to the lower <HI>Palatinate,</HI> and 1657 returned to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Fortunes: a highly accompli&s;hed Prince, much honoured and beloved by his Subjects. In the year 1650. he married <HI>Charlotta,</HI> Daughter to <HI>William</HI> the Fifth <HI>Landgrave,</HI> and to the famous <HI>Amelia Elizabeth, Landgrave&s;s</HI> of <HI>Ha&s;&s;ia;</HI> by whom he had the <HI>Char</HI> Prince, or Electoral Prince <HI>Charles,</HI> and a Daughter, the Prince&s;s <HI>Charlotta Eli|zabetha;</HI> but upon &s;ome di&s;content the Prince&s;s Electre&s;s &s;ince returned to her own Friends and Country. This Elector is al&s;o Knight of the mo&s;t Noble Order of the Garter, Great Trea&s;urer of the Empire, and together with the Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> Vicar of the Empire.</P>
<P>In his Palace or Ca&s;tle at <HI>Heidelberg,</HI> are divers things remarkable; a very great Tower to be equalled by very few; within which is a Theatre for Comedies. This was formerly called <HI>Trutzkai&s;ar,</HI> or the Tower that bad Defiance, or threatned the Emperor; but &s;ince the Re&s;tauration of the Elector, there are &s;ome Works drawn about it in the figure of a Star, and the olddi&s;obliging Name is by Proclamation forbidden to be continued, and it is at pre&s;ent called <HI>Stern&s;chanz,</HI> or the <HI>Star|fort.</HI> By it is a hand&s;om Garden; in the Ditch whereof there was then kept a great Bear, and a very large Wolf. The Grotto's and Wa|ter works are very hand&s;om: they were al&s;o making divers others, having the advantage of the &s;ide of the Hill to bring down the Water, and to make Grots and Caves in the Rock. Among&s;t other Fountains, that of the Lions head with a Frog in his Ear, is taken no|tice of. The Cellars are very large and cool, filled with Ve&s;&s;els of no

ordinary &s;ize; yet incon&s;iderable, if compared to the great Tun kept in a great Building joyning to the Cellars; it was built by this pre&s;ent Elector's Orders, 1664. and goes far beyond any made before: It con|tains 204 Faiders and odd mea&s;ure, or about two hundred Tuns: in|&s;tead of Hoops it is built with large knee Timber, like the ribs of a Ship, which are painted and carved, and have divers In&s;criptions upon them, and &s;upported by carved Pede&s;tals. Upon one &s;ide of it is a hand&s;om Stair ca&s;e to a&s;cend to the top of the Ve&s;&s;el; upon the top of which is a Gallery &s;et round with Balli&s;ters, three and forty &s;teps high from the ground.</P>
<P>About an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mile from <HI>Heidelberg,</HI> between the Hills, is a &s;o|litary place, where three large Streams or Springs gu&s;h out of the Moun|tain, and pre&s;ently fill five Ponds, have three hand&s;om Ca&s;cates or Falls, and after run into the Plain, and are &s;trong enough in a &s;mall &s;pace to turn four Mills; this is called <HI>Wolfsbrun,</HI> or the <HI>Wolfs Foun|tain,</HI> from a Prince&s;s who formerly retired into a Cave in this de&s;ert place, and was here devoured by a <HI>Wolf.</HI></P>
<P>While I was at <HI>Heidelberg,</HI> two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> men came kindly to me, Mr. <HI>Villers,</HI> and <HI>Timothy Middleton,</HI> belonging to <HI>Lobensfeldt Cloi&s;ter,</HI> a Convent formerly of the <HI>Je&s;uites,</HI> but &s;ince let out to about an hun|dred <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who left their Country 1661. came up the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and by the permi&s;&s;ion of the Elector, &s;ettled them&s;elves a few Miles from hence, living all together, Men, Women, and Children, in one hou&s;e; and having a Community of many things: They are of a peculiar Re|ligion, calling them&s;elves Chri&s;tian Jews; and one Mr. <HI>Poole,</HI> former|ly living at <HI>Norwich,</HI> is their Head. They cut not their Beards, and ob|&s;erve many other Ceremonies and Duties, which they either think them&s;elves obliged to from &s;ome Expre&s;&s;ions in the old Te&s;tament, or from &s;ome New Expo&s;ition of their Leaders.</P>

It is an Epi&s;copal See under the Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Mentz:</HI> there are many fair Hou&s;es in it, divers Churches, and a fair Cathedral, with four large Towers. The <HI>Romani&s;ts,</HI> the <HI>Lutherans</HI> and <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> preach in it at &s;everal hours. It is the more populous, and filled with people of good quality, by rea&s;on of the concour&s;e of per&s;ons from other parts of <HI>Germany,</HI> for the deci&s;ion of Law Suits: For here the Imperial Chamber is held, and many differences which ari&s;e in the Empire are determined, and the Electors and other Princes, in &s;ome Tryals at Law, may be called hither. It is a &s;ettled Court, which <HI>Maximilian</HI> the Fir&s;t, for the better ea&s;e of all per&s;ons, placed fir&s;t at <HI>Worms,</HI> and not long after it was fixed at <HI>Spire,</HI> from whence it cannot be now remo|ved, but by the con&s;ent of all the E&s;tates. Things Cogno&s;cible in this Court are determined by an Imperial Judge, and &s;ealed with the Em|perours Arms, &s;o that there lies no appeal unto the Emperor.</P>

being large and uniform, and a Noble Cittadel built; within which, over again&s;t the Gate, the Elector de&s;igns a Palace, the Model of which I &s;aw: and at pre&s;ent, on the right hand, there are three Pavilions of Lodgings: in one of which lodges the Elector <HI>Palatine;</HI> in another the Prince his Son; and in the third the Prince&s;s his Daughter: behind the&s;e there is a hand&s;ome Garden and Lodgings for <HI>Degen Felderen,</HI> the <HI>Churfur&s;ts</HI> Mi&s;tre&s;s. Here are &s;ome good Pictures, as a Head of <HI>Hans Holben,</HI> and a Landskip with the Story of the Union of the <HI>Swi&s;&s;ers.</HI> The Bridge over the Moat of the Cittadel into the Town, is al&s;o remarkable, as having &s;ix Draw-bridges upon it, three great ones, and three &s;mall ones on the &s;ide.

<P>From <HI>Heidelberg</HI> I travelled to <HI>Nurnberg</HI> in the Company of Cap|tain <HI>Wagen&s;eyl,</HI> who had been in the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Hungarian</HI> Wars, and was employed a little before in blowing up the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Laun&s;teyn,</HI> be|longing to the Elector <HI>Palatine,</HI> to prevent its &s;urpri&s;al by the Duke of <HI>Lorrain.</HI> He was then employed to rai&s;e a Company at <HI>Nurnberg,</HI> for the Service of the Elector <HI>Palatine.</HI> I had a good advantage in my Jour|ney by his Company; for he travelled with Authority, and was a ge|nerous, knowing, and courteous per&s;on.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t day we travelled near to the <HI>Neccar,</HI> in &s;tony and rocky way; and it being dark before we came to <HI>Mo&s;pach,</HI> the Pea&s;ants con|ducted us from Village to Village with bundles of lighted Straw.</P>
<P>The next day we came to <HI>Poxberg,</HI> where there is an old Ca&s;tle, and in the afternoon reached <HI>Morkenthal,</HI> or <HI>Mergetheim,</HI> the Seat of the Grand Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Herrhn Deutchern,</HI> or the <HI>Teutonick Order.</HI> The Town is well built, hath a fair <HI>Piazza,</HI> with a large Fountain in it, and a Statue of one of the Grand Ma&s;ters, with a long <HI>Corridore</HI> from his Palace. This Order hath been of great Fame, and hath had large Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions, as may be &s;een in the exact Account of the <HI>Teutonick Knights</HI> of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> made out from the be&s;t Authors, by my worthy honoured Friend Mr. <HI>A&s;hmole,</HI> in his Noble De&s;cription of the Order of the Gar|ter; and as <HI>Lewis du May,</HI> Coun&s;ellor unto the Duke of <HI>Wirtenberg,</HI> hath &s;et it down. <HI>For the Knights Templers and of St.</HI> John, <HI>having fought pro&s;perou&s;ly again&s;t the Infidels, rai&s;ed an Emulation in &s;ome</HI> Ger|man <HI>Gentlemen, who waited upon the Emperor</HI> Frederick <HI>the Fir&s;t, in his Expedition to the</HI> Holy Land, <HI>to take the</HI> Croi&s;ado. <HI>And becau&s;e they were in&s;talled in the Church and Ho&s;pital of St.</HI> Mary <HI>at</HI> Jeru&s;alem, <HI>they were called,</HI> Marianites. <HI>Their Order differed nothing from tho&s;e above-mentioned, but in the form and colour of their Cro&s;s, and was ap|proved by Pope</HI> Cele&s;tin <HI>the Third. Afterwards when</HI> Jeru&s;alem <HI>was taken by</HI> Saladin, <HI>tho&s;e Knights betook them&s;elves to</HI> Ptolemais, <HI>from whence the Emperor</HI> Frederick <HI>the Second, &s;ent them back into</HI> Germany, <HI>and employed them again&s;t the</HI> Pru&s;&s;ians <HI>and</HI> Livonians, <HI>who at that time were &s;till Pagans. But by the Valour and Piety of tho&s;e Knights, their Souls were brought into &s;ubjection to Chri&s;t, and their Bodies to the Or|der which began that War in the year</HI> 1220. <HI>a little while after the&s;e Knights found them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of a Country of very large Extent, which obeyed the Order, till the year</HI> 1525. <HI>at which time</HI> Sigi&s;mond, <HI>King of</HI> Poland, <HI>gave the inve&s;titure of</HI> Pru&s;&s;ia <HI>unto</HI> Albert <HI>Marque&s;s of</HI> Brandenburg. <HI>In the year</HI> 1563. <HI>the Great Ma&s;ter became Secular a|gain,</HI>

<HI>and took a part of the Lands &s;ubject to the Order, with the name of Duke of</HI> Curland. <HI>And</HI> Livonia <HI>having been the Subject and Theatre of many Wars between the</HI> Polanders, Mu&s;covites, <HI>and</HI> Swedes; <HI>the&s;e la&s;t did at length become Ma&s;ters of it, and have it in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;till. So that there is no more remaining of the</HI> Teutonick Order, <HI>but &s;ome Comman|deries &s;cattered here and there in</HI> Germany. <HI>And the Great Ma&s;ter hath his Seat and Re&s;idence at</HI> Mergenthal.</P>
<P>They wear on a white Matle a plain black Cro&s;s. The Dignity of Grand Ma&s;ter is generally held by &s;ome Great and Honourable Per|&s;on; and in the Great A&s;&s;embly he takes place of al Bi&s;hops. The pre&s;ent is the Baron of <HI>Amring;</HI> and the Grand Ma&s;ter before him was <HI>Leopold William,</HI> only Brother to the Emperor <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Third.</P>
<P>From hence we travelled to <HI>Lauterbach,</HI> near which we pa&s;&s;ed through a Wood, and found a Noble Church upon the top of a high Hill, which being much frequented by Pilgrims, they have made hand|&s;ome &s;tone Stairs from the bottom to the top: then to <HI>Rotenburg,</HI> and lodged at <HI>Burgperner,</HI> and the next day by <HI>Schantzbach</HI> we came to <HI>Nu|renberg. Rotenburg</HI> is an Imperial City, which &s;ome have likened unto <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> for its Situation upon hilly places and many Turrets in it. It is Situated near the head of the River <HI>Tauber,</HI> which may be accounted the &s;econd River of <HI>Franconia,</HI> pa&s;&s;ing by <HI>Rottingen, Lan|der,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nurenberg.</NOTE> and <HI>Werthaim,</HI> where it runs into the <HI>Main.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nurenberg</HI> is the faire&s;t City that I &s;aw in <HI>Germany;</HI> the Hou&s;es mo&s;t of them of Free-&s;tone, very high; and divers of them painted on the out&s;ide, and adorned with gilded Balls on the top; many are of &s;ix or &s;even Stories high. <HI>Der Herr Peller</HI> hath one of the faire&s;t. The City is very populous and full of Trade, although it &s;tands in a barren Country, and wants a Navigable River. The three be&s;t Churches are the <HI>Ho&s;pital Church,</HI> lately built very fair; St. <HI>Laurence,</HI> which is very large, with two high Steeples in the Front; and St. <HI>Sebald</HI> the be&s;t of the three. The Body of St. <HI>Sebald</HI> being laid upon a Cart drawn with Oxen, in that place where the Oxen &s;tood &s;till, they buried the Body, and erected this Church in his Memory. In this Church is a Cruci&s;ix of Wood, very well carved, and e&s;teemed at a high rate. The Cruci&s;ix without the Church is very great, and of a black colour: and &s;ome fancy that the <HI>Raht Herrn,</HI> or Magi&s;trates of the Town, have repo&s;ited a Trea&s;ure within it. The Pulpit is well carved and gilded, and the whole Church &s;o &s;tately, that it may pa&s;s in the fir&s;t rank of <HI>Lutheran</HI> Churches; that Religion being here practi&s;ed in its &s;plendour. The Prie&s;t every morning reads the Scripture to the people for half an hour, or preaches a Sermon. The Town-hou&s;e is well worth the &s;eeing: In it the Hall is &s;pacious, as al&s;o the Chambers, and furni&s;hed with good Pictures, and Stoves well gilded and painted with white and gold, green and gold, dark coloured and gold, and the like. There is one Picture of mo&s;t of the Great Per&s;ons in <HI>Germany</HI> entertained in the Great Hall; another of the three Brothers of <HI>Saxony;</HI> one of an Elephant as big as the life; a piece of St. <HI>John</HI> and St. <HI>Mark,</HI> and another of St. <HI>Peter</HI> and St. <HI>Paul,</HI> both by <HI>Albert Durer:</HI> but the mo&s;t rare piece is that of <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> by the &s;ame Ma&s;ter, with this In&s;cription.</P>
<P><Q><L>Albertus Durer Almang faciebat po&s;t Virginis partum, <HI>1507.</HI></L></Q>
<PB N="125" REF="72">
Another excellent one is that of St. <HI>Luke</HI> drawing the Picture of our Saviour and the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin: Over the Gate at the entrance of the Shambles is a large Oxe carved in Wood, and painted over, with this In&s;cription:

The Ca&s;tle &s;tand upon a high Hill, from whence the Town makes a hand&s;ome &s;how: In it are ob&s;ervable a very deep well, the Empe|rors Chappel, his Picture, and the Pictures of the Electors; good Night pieces; and one of a man behind a white Curtain tran&s;parent, very well expre&s;&s;ed. The Armour of <HI>Hebbele van Gailinghen</HI> the great Sor|cerer is here &s;hown; and in the Wall of the Ca&s;tle the marks of his Hor&s;es feet, when he leaped from thence over the <HI>Town ditch.</HI></P>
<P>The new Fountain was not then fini&s;hed; but the Statua's in Bra&s;s made for it were excellent; the Sea Hor&s;es large, the Sea-Nymphs much bigger than the life; and <HI>N ptune,</HI> who was to &s;tand on the top, is above three yards and a halfhigh. When I came fir&s;t into this place, I was not a little &s;urprized to behold the fairne&s;s of the Hou&s;es, hand|&s;ome Streets, different Habits, indu&s;trious People, and neatne&s;s in all things, more than I had ob&s;erved in <HI>German</HI> Cities before; and no place hath greater number of curious Artificers in Steel, Bra&s;s, Ivory, Wood, wherein they work at an extraordinary cheap rate; and there are Officers to in&s;pect and enquire into the works of Artificers, that they be true, perfect and without fraud: they make &s;trong and hand|&s;ome Clock-work. The King of <HI>Poland</HI> pre&s;ented the Grand Seignior with a very noble Clock, who took &s;o much delight in it, that when it required &s;ome mending (the <HI>Turks</HI> being ignorant in Clock-work) he &s;ent it from <HI>Adrianople</HI> as far as <HI>Nurenburg</HI> to be &s;et in order a|gain.</P>
<P><HI>Gu&s;tavus Adolphus,</HI> King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> was more magnificently received and entertained in this City, than in any other of <HI>Germany;</HI> which &s;o incen&s;ed <HI>Wallen&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">yn,</HI> that he afterwards encamped before their Town, and did great &s;poil upon their Territories: But the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> marched thither towards their Relief, and from thence towards <HI>Lutzen,</HI> where in a bloody Battel he lo&s;t his life.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Pegnitz</HI> runnes through <HI>Nurnberg,</HI> and hath divers Stone Bridges over it; and below the Town, joyning with the River <HI>Red|nitz,</HI> runs into the River <HI>Main</HI> at <HI>Bamberg;</HI> and the <HI>Main</HI> runs at la&s;t into the <HI>Rhine.</HI> The <HI>Reduitz</HI> ari&s;es at <HI>Wei&s;senberg,</HI> and is not far from the River <HI>Altmul,</HI> which runs into the <HI>Danube,</HI> towards <HI>Regen&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">urg.</HI> Upon this convenience, <HI>Charles</HI> the great de&s;igned to make a Communication of pa&s;&s;age between the <HI>Danube</HI> and the <HI>Rhine;</HI> and made a <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> thirty paces abroad between the <HI>Rednitz</HI> and the <HI>Altmul,</HI> to joyn tho&s;e Streams for the commodity of Pa&s;&s;age by Boat; but after he had prooceeded two <HI>German</HI> miles in this work, Boggs, Rains, and his warlike Diver&s;ions made him give over that noble De|&s;ign, whereby there might have been a Commerce by water, from the <HI>Low C un ries</HI> to <HI>Vienna,</HI> and even unto the <HI>Euxine Sea.</HI></P>

<P>About four Leagues from <HI>Nurnberg</HI> lies <HI>Altdorff,</HI> belonging unto it, made an Univer&s;ity in the year 1623. containing when I was there, about 150 Scholars.

Dr <HI>Hoffman</HI> the <HI>Botanick</HI> and <HI>Anatomick Profe&s;&s;our,</HI> &s;hew'd me many of the mo&s;t rare of them; and pre&s;ented me divers.

<P>But that which chiefly promotes its lu&s;tre, is the General Diet or Parliament, which is often held in this City, and is not to be called in any part out of <HI>Germany;</HI> and the place is not unfit for the accommo|dation of &s;uch a noble Convention, as are the E&s;tates of <HI>Germany.</HI> The Vice-Mar&s;hal takes care to provide Lodgings re&s;pectively to their per&s;ons&punc; and &s;ees that all things be brought hither, and at a ju&s;t price; that the Hall or Place of A&s;&s;embly be furni&s;hed and adorned &s;uitably to the dignity of the Per&s;ons convened, and hath an e&s;pecial eye and re|gard towards the Publick &s;afety.

<P>I entred the notable River <HI>Danubius</HI> at this place, which hath al|ready run a good cour&s;e, and pa&s;&s;ed by many fair Towns or Cities; as the large City of <HI>&V;lme</HI> in <HI>Swabenland,</HI> where it begins to be Na|vigable; as al&s;o <HI>Donawert, Neuburg,</HI> and <HI>Ingol&s;tadt,</HI> and hath already received the con&s;iderable River of <HI>Licus</HI> or <HI>Leck</HI> whereby the Com|modities of that great trading City of <HI>Aug&s;berg,</HI> are brought into it.

<P>It was an ancient place of Habitation in the time of the <HI>Romans,</HI> and called <HI>Vindobona,</HI> as the Learned <HI>Petrus Lambecius</HI> hath at large declared, where the <HI>Cla&s;&s;is I&s;trica</HI> &s;ometimes lay, and the tenth <HI>Ger|man Legion</HI> had its &s;tation; all this &s;hoar or &s;ide of the <HI>Danube</HI> being fa|mous for the Actions of <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors again&s;t the <HI>Marcomanni</HI> and <HI>Quadi,</HI> who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Country on the other &s;ide of the River, and e&s;pecially for the Wars of <HI>Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Philo&s;ophus,</HI> who notably defeated tho&s;e Nations, and who, as <HI>Aurelius Vic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">or</HI> (who was Governor of <HI>Sirmium</HI> in <HI>Pannonia in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">erior,</HI> in the time of <HI>Con&s;tan|tius)</HI> affirms, fell &s;ick at <HI>Carnuntum,</HI> now <HI>Petronel,</HI> and died at <HI>Vindobona,</HI> now <HI>Vienna.</HI> And to confirm the Antiquity hereof, be&s;ides what <HI>Wolfgangus Lazius</HI> hath delivered, not many years &s;ince &s;ome Antiquities were found. For in the year 1662. when a Wall was dig|ged up near&punc; the old Palace, the Workmen digging &s;till on below the Foundation, found a Stone Trough or Coffin, containing hard Earth and Bones, with a &s;mall Gold Coyn, a Gla&s;s Urn enclo&s;ed in a Bra&s;s one, an Iron Knife like a <HI>Sice&s;pita,</HI> or Knife u&s;ed about Sacrifices, a lit|tle Roll or Scroll of pure Gold, &s;hut up with a Golden cover at both ends, wherein was an In&s;cription in &s;trange Characters: Not far from the Sepulchral Monument were found a Head in Bra&s;s, a Brazen <HI>Pate|ra,</HI> Lamps, Lachrymatories, and other Ve&s;&s;els, and a Copper Coyn of <HI>Antoninus Caracalla.</HI> The writing in the Golden Scroll, which no man could read, was conceived by the Learned <HI>Lambecius</HI> to be the old <HI>Pannonian</HI> Character, and that this might be the Monument of &s;ome <HI>Pannonian</HI> Prie&s;t in the days of <HI>Caracalla,</HI> who, as good Authors deliver, &s;pent &s;ome time about the&s;e parts.</P>

<P>It is not &s;eated upon the main &s;tream of the <HI>Danube,</HI> but by a branch thereof; for the River running through a low Country; it is divided into &s;everal Streams, and makes many I&s;lands. A &s;mall River named <HI>Wien</HI> runs by the Ea&s;t part of this City, and enters the <HI>Danube,</HI> below it, which upon floods doth often much hurt, yet &s;ometimes low and very &s;hallow, &s;o as I have &s;tepped over it; &s;ome will have it to give the Name unto this City: it divides part of the Suburbs from it, and hath divers Bridges over it. For that we may have a di&s;tinct appre|hen&s;ion of <HI>Vienna,</HI> we mu&s;t con&s;ider the City and Suburbs thereof; the Suburbs are very great, and not without fair Hou&s;es, Gardens, Walks, and all Accommodations at large.</P>
<P>The City it &s;elf is that walled and fortified part, de&s;igned not only for convenience of Habitation, but al&s;o to &s;u&s;tain a Siege, or any At|tack from the <HI>Turk,</HI> and is now &s;eparated from the Suburbs by a fair <HI>E&s;planade,</HI> or open Ground, above a Musket &s;hot over. The Hou&s;es near the wall were pulled down &s;ince the la&s;t Fortification in the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> war, when they were in &s;ome fear that the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Forces about <HI>Gran</HI> and <HI>New-hu&s;el,</HI> would move towards them. It is fortified <HI>a la moder|na,</HI> with ten Ba&s;tions towards the Land, and a very deep Ditch, into which they can let the <HI>Da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ube:</HI> and with two other Ba&s;tions towards the water, on that part of the River which lies on the North-&s;ide of the Town. The&s;e two latter are called the Works of Gonzaga. The Ba&s;tions are large; upon one of them I &s;aw Count <HI>Souches</HI> mu&s;ter a good part of the Militia of the City. The Ditch is large and very deep, into which although they can let in the River, yet it is commonly kept dry, le&s;t they might incommode their deep Cellars. There are two walls, the one old and inward, little con&s;iderable at pre&s;ent, built at fir&s;t with the ran&s;om of our King <HI>Richard</HI> the Fir&s;t, who in his return from the Holy War, was detained Pri&s;oner by the Duke of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> upon the 20<HI>th</HI> of <HI>December,</HI> 1192. The <HI>Au&s;trians</HI> pretending they had received &s;ome affront from the King at <HI>Joppa,</HI> and that he had taken down the En&s;ign and Banner of Duke <HI>Leopold</HI> in a contemptuous way. The other outward of a great breadth, made of Earth, and faced with Brick, edged with Free-&s;tone, &s;o well built, as to render this City one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable fortified places in <HI>Europe.</HI> The <HI>E&s;planade</HI> gently de&s;cends from the Town for three hundred Paces; there are very few Outworks.</P>
<P>It is very uncertain who was the fir&s;t Builder of <HI>Vienna,</HI> and after it had been long built it ran to decay again for Four hundred years toge|ther, till <HI>Henry</HI> the Fir&s;t, Duke of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> in the year 1158. did much repair it; and the ran&s;om afterwards of King <HI>Richard</HI> beautified it.</P>

The whole compa&s;s, taking in the Suburbs, makes a very large Cir|cuit, but the City it &s;elf, which is walled in, may be about three miles in Circumference, and is exceeding populous, as full of People, for the bigne&s;s of the place, as mo&s;t of the great Cities.

<P>The chief Gates are &s;ix: 1. <HI>Stubnthor,</HI> or the <HI>Stuben Gate</HI> towards the Ea&s;t. 2. <HI>Karnterthor,</HI> or the <HI>Gate of Carinthia</HI> towards the South. 3. <HI>Burg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">hor,</HI> the <HI>Town Gate,</HI> or <HI>Ca&s;tle Gate.</HI> 4. <HI>Schottenthor,</HI> or the <HI>Scotch Gate.</HI> 5. <HI>Newthor,</HI> or the <HI>Neagate;</HI> the&s;e two la&s;t towards the We&s;t: And 6. the <HI>Gate of the red Tower</HI> towards the North, which leads unto the Bridge over the <HI>Danube:</HI> and towards the water-&s;ide there is al&s;o a Port by the Emperor's palace, and a Cloy&s;ter or Nunne|ry in the Town hath the Name of a Port called <HI>Himmel port,</HI> or the <HI>Gate of Heaven.</HI> The five fir&s;t of the&s;e Gates are vaulted and arched with long pa&s;&s;ages through the Town-wall, and have good Bridges of Wood, with Draw-bridges to pa&s;s over the Town ditch: The &s;ixth is under a Tower, and leads to the Bridges of the <HI>Danube:</HI> For that River runs here in a flat low Country, divides its &s;treams, &s;o that to pa&s;s it quite over, there are at pre&s;ent &s;even long Bridges made up of many thou&s;and Trees laid one by another, after their way of making Bridges. There is al&s;o a Bridge within the City of <HI>Vienna,</HI> called the <HI>Hochbrug,</HI> or <HI>High-bridge,</HI> which is made by the cro&s;&s;ing of two Streets at equal Angles; the ground of one &s;treet being as high as the tops of the Hou&s;es of the other, &s;o th t to continue it, they were forced to build a Bridge or Arch in the <HI>Lower &s;treet,</HI> to let the upper to pa&s;s over it.</P>
<P>The City is fairly built of &s;tone, and well paved; many Hou&s;es are of &s;ix &s;tories high; they are &s;omewhat flat roofed after the <HI>Italian</HI> way; the Streets are not narrow, but the compa&s;s of ground will not admit them to be very broad; and their Buildings are remarkable both above and below ground; their Cellars are very deep. To &s;atisfie my curio&s;ity, I went into &s;ome of them, and found four Cellars one under another; they were arched, and had two pair of Stairs to de&s;cend into them. Some have an open &s;pace in the middle of each roof, to let the Air out of one Cellar into another, and from the lowe&s;t an <HI>adit</HI> or <HI>tu|be</HI> unto the top, to let the Air in and out from the &s;treet, &s;omewhat af|ter the manner of the Mines.</P>

<P>They have this Account how the&s;e came fir&s;t to be &s;et up in this place: That when <HI>Solyman</HI> the Magnificent be&s;ieged <HI>Vienna,</HI> percei|ving the Forces in the City to be ob&s;tinate, he had an intent to bat|ter down the Steeple about their ears: But &s;ome of the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI>'s and great Commanders, adverti&s;ing him how unprofitable a bu&s;ine&s;s it would prove, and withal when he took the City, what an honour it would be unto him to have &s;uch a Noble Pyramid in his Dominions: He &s;ent word into the Town, That he was willing to &s;pare the Steople,

upon condition that they would &s;et up the half Moon and Star (the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Arms) upon the top thereof. They returned An&s;wer that they would, if he would &s;end the &s;ame unto them; which he did, and they placed it where it &s;tands.</P>
<P>This Spire hath the large&s;t Crockets I have ob&s;erved in any, they being above a yard long, and adorned with foliage work. The Spire of <HI>Land&s;hute</HI> in <HI>Bavaria,</HI> is accounted the highe&s;t in <HI>Germany;</HI> that of <HI>Strasburg,</HI> the neate&s;t and faire&s;t; and this of <HI>Vienna</HI> the large&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t. And therefore it is no wonder, that when the Amba&s;&s;adors of <HI>Bo&s;na</HI> formerly came unto <HI>Vienna,</HI> they &s;o often viewed and admired this Fabrick, and plainly &s;aid, That all the mony in their Country was not &s;ufficient to have built it.</P>
<P>This Steeple is accounted about four hundred &s;ixty and five foot high, being about half way up three hundred and thirty eight &s;teps. Be&s;ides other Hills, I could &s;ee <HI>Haimburger</HI> Hill within two miles of <HI>Presburg,</HI> and a great part of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> which the long Cour&s;e of the <HI>Danube</HI> rendred very plea&s;ant and delightful into the eye. In the Chamber or Room from whence I had this pro&s;pect, there is a Clock, who&s;e Ca&s;e being of wood, was in part burnt down by Lightning, and therefore there is water always kept in this place to extingui&s;h the fire, and a man continually watches in the place where the Bells hang. There is al&s;o an In&s;trument of wood, or wooden Bells or Hammers, which they make u&s;e of from <HI>Good-Friday</HI> till <HI>Ea&s;ter-&s;unday,</HI> all the time that our Saviour was in the Grave, during which time they permit no Bells to ring.</P>

<P>In this Church of St. <HI>Stephen,</HI> be&s;ides many Monuments of great Princes and famous Per&s;ons, divers learned men have Sepulchral In|&s;criptions; as <HI>Johannes Faber, Bi&s;hop of Vienna; Johannes Cu&s;pinianus,</HI> and <HI>Seba&s;tianus Tengnagelius,</HI> formerly Library-keeper, Hi&s;toriogra|pher, and Councellor to the Emperour, an extraordinary learned man, and skilful in fifteen Languages, as the In&s;cription delivers; as <HI>Hebrew, Syriack, Chaldee, Per&s;ian, Arabick, Turki&s;h, Aethiopick, Greek, Latin, Italian, French, Spani&s;h, German, Belgick,</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>The Univer&s;ity of <HI>Vienna</HI> is al&s;o remarkable, if we con&s;ider the An|tiquity thereof, the number of Scholars their cour&s;e of Studies, their accommodations, privileges and advancements. This is &s;aid to have been begun by <HI>Albertus</HI> the Third, above three hundred years pa&s;t; and their Rules, Orders, and Statutes to have been borrowed from the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Paris,</HI> and the Students were di&s;tingui&s;hed into four Divi&s;ions or Nations; who, be&s;ides the General, have their particular Rules and Officers, and were comprehended under the <HI>Cla&s;&s;is</HI> of <HI>Au|&s;trians,</HI> Nations of the <HI>Rhine, Hungarians,</HI> and <HI>Saxons.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>Au&s;trian</HI> Divi&s;ion were contained the <HI>Friulians,</HI> all of the Dio|ce&s;e of <HI>Trent,</HI> all <HI>Italy,</HI> with the other Provinces beyond the Moun|tains.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Cla&s;&s;is</HI> of the <HI>Rhine</HI> were comprehended <HI>Suevians, Al&s;atians, Franconians, Ha&s;&s;ians;</HI> al&s;o all the Provinces to the South-we&s;t, as <HI>France, Spain, Navarre, Holland, Brabant.</HI></P>
<P>In the third <HI>Cla&s;&s;is,</HI> or <HI>Natio Hungarioe,</HI> were contained <HI>Hungarians, Bohemians, Polonians, Moravians, Sclavonians,</HI> all that &s;peak the <HI>Sclavo|nian</HI> Tongue, and al&s;o <HI>Germans.</HI></P>
<P>To the <HI>Cla&s;&s;is</HI> or <HI>Natio Saxonum,</HI> were reduced <HI>Saxons, We&s;tphalians, Fri&s;landers, Turingians, Mi&s;nians, Brandenburgers, Pru&s;&s;ians, Livonians, Lu&s;atians, Pomeranians,</HI> with the <HI>&V;ltramarine</HI> Kingdoms of <HI>England, Scotland, Ireland, Sweden, Norway,</HI> and <HI>Denmark.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Divi&s;ions take up all the Nations of <HI>Europe;</HI> and indeed there are Students here of many Nations: and upon Contentions and Differences the &s;everal <HI>Cla&s;&s;es</HI> will hold unto their own, and take parts, and bandy again&s;t each other, but will all unite and hold together in differences with Towns-men or Jews, which happen &s;ometimes unto an high degree.</P>
<P>They follow here the old beaten way of Knowledge: and I met with few who had any good in&s;ight in new <HI>Philo&s;ophy;</HI> but there are many good <HI>Philologers,</HI> and are well ver&s;ed in Languages, Hi&s;tory and Antiquity: and there are many Learned Men either educated here, or come from other parts. Some who had taken notice of the <HI>Royal Society</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> were very inqui&s;itive after it; and when I had &s;a|tisfied them in all particulars, were very much plea&s;ed therewith. If they &s;hould fall into the way of <HI>Experimental Philo&s;ophy,</HI> being very indu&s;trious, 'tis very probable they may do much therein, and they were &s;ure to have the countenance of the Emperor. I found them al&s;o much affected with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Society in other parts of <HI>Germany.</HI> At the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Altorff</HI> I was much enquired of concerning it: and a Magi&s;trate of <HI>Nurnburg,</HI> who had got a <HI>Tile&s;cope</HI> from <HI>London,</HI> invi|ted me to his Hou&s;e, to practice the way of u&s;ing it. <HI>Der Herr von</HI>

Empre&s;s Dowager <HI>Elconora,</HI> who was a &s;ober and prudent Prince&s;s, well skilled in all kind of curious Works, and delighted &s;ometimes to &s;hoot at Deer from a Stand, or at other Game, out of her Coach.

<P>He &s;peaks four Languages, <HI>German, Italian, Spani&s;h,</HI> and <HI>Latin.</HI> He is a great Countenancer of Learned Men, and delights to read, and when occa&s;ion permits, will pa&s;s &s;ome hours at it. The worthy <HI>Pe|trus Lambecius,</HI> his Library Keeper, and who is in great e&s;teem with him, will u&s;ually find out &s;ome Books for him which he conceives may be acceptable. While I was there he recommended a Tran&s;la|tion of <HI>Religio Medici</HI> unto him, wherewith the Emperor was exceed|ingly plea&s;ed, and &s;pake very much of it unto <HI>Lambecius,</HI> in&s;omuch that <HI>Lambecius</HI> asked me whether I knew the Author, he being of my own name, and whether <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">he were living: And when he under&s;tood my near Relation to him, he became more kind and courteous than ever, and de&s;ired me to &s;end him that Book in the Original <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> which he would put into the Emperors Library: and pre&s;ented me with a neat little <HI>Latin</HI> Book, called <HI>Princeps in Compendio,</HI> writ|ten by the Emperors Father, <HI>Ferdinandus</HI> the Third.</P>
<P>He is al&s;o skilful in Mu&s;ick, compo&s;es well, and delighted much in it, both at his Palace and the Church, which makes &s;o many Mu&s;ici|ans in <HI>Vienna;</HI> for no place abounds more with them; and in the E|vening we &s;eldom &s;ailed of Mu&s;ick in the Streets, and at our Windows: And the Emperors delight herein makes the Church-men take the greater care to &s;et off their Church-Mu&s;ick, for he goes of|ten to Church, and not to one, but divers, e&s;pecially the be&s;t Conven|tual Churches: and in his own Chappel &s;ome of his own Compo&s;iti|ons are often play'd. He hath al&s;o excellent Mu&s;ick in his Palace, both Vocal and In&s;trumental; and his private Chappel is well &s;erved, where be&s;ides the excellent Mu&s;ick, there are always eight or ten Counts, Pages to the Emperor, who &s;erve at the Altar with white wax Torches in their hands; and after the manner of the <HI>Italian</HI> Princes, divers <HI>Eunuchs</HI> to &s;ing.</P>
<P>For his Recreations abroad, he delights much in Hunting, e&s;pecially of the wild Boar in due &s;ea&s;ons; I have known him bring home &s;ix Boars in a morning. Some &s;tout per&s;ons, particularly count <HI>Nicholas Serini,</HI> would encounter a wild Boar alone, but at la&s;t he unfortu|nately peri&s;hed by one, which hath made others more wary &s;ince; and therefore when the Boar is at a Bay, the Hunt&s;men &s;o &s;tand about him, that the Emperor, or other great per&s;ons, may more &s;afely make u&s;e of their Boar-&s;pears upon him.</P>
<P>Surely there are great numbers of them about the Country, for they are no unu&s;ual or extraordinary Di&s;h in the City, though of a de|licious and plea&s;ing ta&s;te.

The Hunt&s;men are notably ver&s;ed and skilful in that Game; for though they &s;ee it not, they will di&s;tingui&s;h a wild from a common Swine, and gue&s;s whether that which they hunt

<P>Though the Emperor goes not to war in Per&s;on, yet hath he been &s;ucce&s;sful in his wars, e&s;pecially in the Battel with the <HI>Turks</HI> at St. <HI>Go|dart,</HI> where the bu&s;ine&s;s was hand&s;omly and actively managed, to &s;et upon the body of the <HI>Turks,</HI> which had pa&s;&s;ed the River <HI>Rab,</HI> before the whole Forces of the <HI>Vizier</HI> could come over, to the great &s;laughter of the <HI>Jani&s;aries</HI> and <HI>Turks,</HI> who fought &s;toutly, and
<PB N="144" REF="82">
were fir&s;t put to a Retreat by the <HI>French</HI> Cavalry. For at fir&s;t the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;eemed to prevail, and had &s;lain a great part of two Regiments of the <HI>Auxiliari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> which came out of <HI>Franconia,</HI> and after their cu&s;tom, had cut off their Heads.</P>
<P>But his later wars have been &s;till more fortunate, wherein he hath not only relieved <HI>Vienna,</HI> and taken divers cities from the <HI>Turks;</HI> but remains &s;till Ma&s;ter of the Field in <HI>Hungary.</HI> Among the many no|table things in <HI>Vienna,</HI> the <HI>Imperial</HI> Library is very remarkable. He who hath &s;een the <HI>Bodleian</HI> Library at <HI>Oxford,</HI> and the <HI>Vatican,</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> would be much &s;urprized to find &s;uch a notable one here, as may compare with them; e&s;pecially upon the extreme Borders of the Learn|ed part of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The number and noblene&s;s of the Books doth much exceed the re|ceptacle or place which contains them, as making no fair &s;hew at the en|trance, and &s;omewhat wanting light. But as for the number and value of the Books, they are of opinion here that it yields unto none, but rather excels any other Library in <HI>Europe.</HI> There was a place de&s;igned for the building of a fit receptacle for them; but, I know not how, a Thea|tre for Comedies is now built in that place.</P>
<P>It is divided into eight Chambers or Rooms, which are &s;o well filled, that many Books are fain to lie upon the Floor; and the Shelves &s;tand &s;o clo&s;e, that there is but ju&s;t room to pa&s;s between them. The Ma|nu&s;cripts, &s;tand di&s;tinct from the printed Books, according to their Lan|guages, being divided into &s;ix <HI>Cla&s;&s;es, Theological, Juridical, Medical, Philo&s;ophical, Hi&s;torical, Philological.</HI> There can &s;carce be a more ad|mirable Collection than the Manu&s;cripts in part of the fir&s;t Chamber, of <HI>Hebrew, Syriack, Arabick, Turki&s;h, Armenian, Aethiopick,</HI> and <HI>Chi|ne&s;e</HI> Books.</P>
<P>It was begun, at lea&s;t the Books began to be placed in this recepta|cle, by <HI>Maximilian</HI> the Fir&s;t, but hath been much encrea&s;ed by &s;uc|ceeding Emperors, mo&s;t of them, &s;ince <HI>Rodolphus</HI> the Fir&s;t, being much addicted unto Learning, there having been large acce&s;&s;ions from many noble Libraries, and mo&s;t upon the co&s;t of the Emperors. The choi|ce&s;t Books in the famous Library of <HI>Buda,</HI> of King <HI>Matthias Corvinus,</HI> Son unto <HI>Huniades,</HI> are now in it. The notable Library of <HI>Wolfgan|gus Lazius,</HI> who was Library-Keeper, was brought hither, and Three thou&s;and Books of <HI>Johannes Sambucus</HI> are now in this Repo&s;i|tory.</P>
<P><HI>Augerius Bushequius,</HI> &s;ometime Library-Keeper hereof, added much unto it; and in his two <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Emba&s;&s;ies procured a great number of noble <HI>Greek</HI> Manu&s;cripts at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> which are in&s;cribed with his own hand, <HI>Aug. de Bu&s;beck. emit Con&s;tantinopoli.</HI> A great many were added from the Library of the Learned <HI>Johannes Cu&s;pinianus,</HI> Library Keeper, and Councellor unto the Emperor. The notable Li|braries and Mathematical In&s;truments of <HI>Tycho Brahe, Kepler,</HI> and <HI>Ga&s;&s;endus,</HI> were purcha&s;ed for it. But the large&s;t acce&s;&s;ion was made by the noble Library of Count <HI>Fugger,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ixteen thou&s;and Volumes, was purcha&s;ed by <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Third. Many were brought, &s;ome few years pa&s;t, from the <HI>Ambra&s;ian</HI> Library by <HI>In&s;pruck,</HI> by the Learned <HI>Petrus Lambecius,</HI> Library-keeper, Hi&s;toriogra|pher, and Councellor unto the pre&s;ent Emperor; who hath al&s;o an ex|cellent Library which is like to be added unto the <HI>Imperial.</HI> He then
<PB N="145" REF="82">
reckoned the Volumes in this great Library to amount at lea&s;t to Four&s;core thou&s;and; and by this time that number may be increa&s;ed, for he adds &s;ome yearly. And the number might almo&s;t be end|le&s;s, if they would make u&s;e of their privilege, for the Emperor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> ath a right to have two Books of all that are printed in <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>They have al&s;o a great advantage at <HI>Vienna</HI> to acquire good <HI>Manu|&s;cripts</HI> from the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Dominions, for the Emperor is obliged to have a Re&s;ident with the Grand <HI>Sei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nior</HI> where&s;oever he moves or orders him to be; even at the la&s;t fight of St. <HI>Godart,</HI> the Emperor's Re|&s;ident was in the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Camp. And when I was at <HI>Lari&s;&s;a,</HI> in <HI>The&s;|&s;aly,</HI> the Re&s;ident <HI>Signor de Ca&s;a Nova,</HI> was inqui&s;itive after Books to be found among the <HI>Greeks</HI> in Mona&s;teries and other places. And this Emperor, like his Father, will &s;pare no co&s;t toward &s;uch Acquiries.</P>
<P>By the e&s;pecial favour of my noble Friend <HI>Lambecius,</HI> I went many times into this Library, and he was &s;o courteous as to let me have what Books I de&s;ired unto my private Lodging: He would &s;hew me divers Books upon what Subject I required, and offered me a &s;ight of what Books he thought rare and e&s;timable; and among&s;t others I could not but take notice of the&s;e following:</P>

<P>I went unto divers noted Places about <HI>Vienna:</HI> I walked unto the Hill of <HI>Vienna,</HI> two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> miles di&s;tant from the Town, going up all the way by an ea&s;ie A&s;cent; from whence I had a pro&s;pect of the Ci|ty, and the Compagnia about it, together with the high Mountains in

<HI>Steirmark</HI> covered with Snow: and in my return &s;aw the Palace of the Empre&s;s Dowager without the Town, called <HI>la Favorita,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ed by the Convent of the <HI>Paulini.</HI></P>
<P>About two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> miles Ea&s;tward from <HI>Vienna,</HI> there is a very no|ble Garden-place belonging to the Emperor, built by <HI>Rodolphu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> the Se|cond, which hath been formerly well furni&s;hed, and provided with Plants, but now &s;eems to be neglected, and &s;omewhat ruinous. It con&s;i&s;ts of an inward and an outward &s;quare Garden: The inward is two hundred ordinary paces &s;quare, about the &s;ame bigne&s;s with the Place Royal at <HI>Paris:</HI> It hath a <HI>Portico</HI> or <HI>Cloyster,</HI> &s;upported by Forty Pillars of white Stone on each &s;ide, and is covered with Copper; as are al&s;o the Pavilions which the common people think to be Gold. Be&s;ides this, there is an hand&s;om row of Buildings well &s;eated, called <HI>N&eacute;w-gaba&uacute;,</HI> in which at pre&s;ent are many wild Bea&s;ts kept. Lions and Tigres breed here, and have young ones. Some &s;ay this was the place of <HI>Solyman</HI> the Magnificent's Tent when he be&s;ieged <HI>Vienna.</HI> But it is rather the Figure of his Pavilion which was placed on the other &s;ide of the City.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o, about two or three miles from <HI>Vienna,</HI> a noted place of Devotion, called <HI>Arnols,</HI> much frequented, e&s;pecially in <HI>Lent,</HI> divers carrying Cro&s;&s;es very heavy all the way upon their &s;houlders. There is here a little Hou&s;e built exactly after that of the Scpulchre at <HI>Jeru|&s;alem;</HI> and al&s;o a hand&s;om Copy of the Picture of our Saviour and the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> with their exact heights. That of our Saviour is about two yards high; that of the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin three or four fingers breadth lower: The&s;e are taken from the Original in St. <HI>John de Lateran</HI> at <HI>Rome.</HI> Hither the Empre&s;s de&s;ired to go one morning from her own Palace on Foot, out of Devotion, which &s;he performed, though with a great deal of difficulty, &s;he being not u&s;ed to walk, and the way was du&s;ty. The Emperor accompanied her and all the Court followed on foot, which made a hand&s;ome &s;hew.</P>
<P>Nearer unto <HI>Vienna</HI> there is al&s;o a remarkable place for Devotion, called <HI>Itzing:</HI> and in the way from <HI>Vienna</HI> unto it, the twelve Stati|ons of the Cro&s;s are marked out in imitation of what is ob&s;erved near <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> in the <HI>Via Crucis,</HI> or <HI>Doloro&s;a,</HI> in our Saviour's proceeding from the City unto Mount <HI>Calvary;</HI> the the Figures thereof are print|ed, and the &s;everal paces between every Station &s;et down. The Empe|ror hath a hand&s;om Park near <HI>Vienna,</HI> called the <HI>Brater,</HI> wherein I beheld the effects of the great Lightning and Thunder which happen|ed three days before, upon many great Trees which were torn, &s;plit, or twi&s;ted. There is a Hou&s;e of Plea&s;ure in it, where among other things, I could not but take notice of a Mu&s;ical In&s;trument which I had not &s;een before, a <HI>Seat</HI> or <HI>Che&s;tdrum;</HI> it hath a Cord like that of a <HI>Sea-trum|pet,</HI> but &s;ounds like a <HI>Kettle-drum.</HI></P>
<P>I went al&s;o unto <HI>Laxamburg,</HI> whither the Emperor often retires; he hath a Hou&s;e in this place, but it is old, and not large. There is al&s;o a Hou&s;e of Plea&s;ure in the Mote, into which there is no other pa&s;|&s;age but through a high <HI>Corridore.</HI> T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e Ca&s;tle is commodiou&s;ly &s;eat|ed for the Emperors recreation; and there is an eight-&s;quare Hou&s;e in the <HI>Mar&s;h,</HI> from which the Nobility and the Empre&s;s Dowager &s;ome|times u&s;ed to &s;hoot, &s;he being very expert therein. Over the Gate of the Emperors Hou&s;e hangs a great Rib and Jaw-bone, whereof I could get no better account, than they were the Rib and Jaw-bone of

a heathen maid. They &s;eemed to me to be Bones of an <HI>Elephant.</HI> But many things that are old or ob&s;cure, they call, in this Country, Hea|then: as <HI>Roman</HI> Coyns, they call Heathen money. And the Pea&s;ants brought me, in a place which had been formerly an old <HI>Roman</HI> Station, part of the bit of a Bridle digged up, which they concluded to be a Heathen Key.</P>
<P>From hence I went unto <HI>Manner&s;dorff,</HI> &s;eated not far from the River <HI>Leyta,</HI> where there is a natural <HI>h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t Bath,</HI> called the <HI>Wildebath;</HI> it ari|&s;es under a Church, the Church being built over the Spring-head. The water of it is but Luke-warm, and therefore when they de&s;ire it hotter, they boyl it, and &s;o bathe in Tubs in a large room. From that Sub&s;tance which &s;ticks to the &s;ides of the Coppers in the boyl|ing of it, they judge it to be impregnated with <HI>Sulphur, Salt-peter,</HI> and <HI>Chalk.</HI> The water colours the &s;tones, and makes them look, when wet, like fine <HI>Turquoi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s.</HI> And the vapour of the Bath hanging upon the Mo&s;s on the &s;ides, gives it an Amber or Gold colour.

The Stones are large and they cut, and &s;quare them at the Quarry.</P>
<P>From hence I proceeded to the <HI>New&s;idler &s;ea</HI> or <HI>Lake,</HI> &s;o called from <HI>New&s;idle,</HI> which is a Town &s;eated upon the Northern part of it, con|&s;i&s;ting of one &s;treet and &s;ome back-hou&s;es, and a &s;mall, &s;quare, old Ca&s;tle upon a Hill, from whence I had a good pro&s;pect over the Lake. It is about three <HI>German</HI> miles broad, and &s;even miles long. The faire&s;t Lake in the&s;e parts affording plenty of Fi&s;h; encompa&s;&s;ed and thickly &s;et about with &s;mall Towns and Villages; and hath no River, at lea&s;t not con&s;iderable, running into or out of it. A little way from the Gate of <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;idle</HI> they dig out a black earth, out of which they make <HI>Salt|peter.</HI> In this Journey, not far from <HI>Himburg,</HI> we pa&s;&s;ed by a place called <HI>Rauckward,</HI> which, though it &s;eems not high, looks over a great part of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> and as far as <HI>Brin,</HI> the &s;econd City of <HI>Moravia,</HI> a part al&s;o of the Kingdom of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and a part of the Kingdom of <HI>Hun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">a.</HI> I went afterwards four <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> miles up the Stream of the <HI>Danube,</HI> to &s;ee a noted Quarry of Stone in a Hill called <HI>Altenburg.</HI> The beds, rows, or ca&s;es of the Stones lie not horizontally, but rather elevated North|ward, about the height of the Angle forty, yet are not always &s;o re|gularly placed, but rather follow the &s;hape of the Hill, and according to that are differently &s;ituated. Here I al&s;o ob&s;erved a Sub&s;tance be|tween a Clay and a &s;tone called <HI>Leber&s;tein,</HI> or <HI>Liver&s;tone;</HI> and upon many of the&s;e Stones I found the figures of Trees and Leaves, though not &s;o deep or neat as upon the Stones by <HI>Florence;</HI> yet very prettily marked, and often with broader Leaves, than I had el&s;ewhere ob&s;erved.

their Cells they had paved the ground with tho&s;e Stones I mentioned, which were naturally marked with the Shapes of Trees and Plants.</P>
<P>After an open Autumn there followed a &s;harp Winter at <HI>Vienna,</HI> in the months of <HI>December</HI> and <HI>January.</HI> The branches of the <HI>Danube</HI> were &s;oon frozen over. The main Stream, by rea&s;on of its &s;wift Cur|rent, held out longer, but was afterwards al&s;o frozen. Some have thought that this River is more apt to freez than others. And we read of Battels which have been fought upon this River frozen; but I could not make any regular Ob&s;ervation thereof. This hard weather, the ground being covered with Snow, afforded hand&s;om Re|creations unto men, and &s;ome unto the Ladies, in running Cour&s;es in hand&s;om Sleds and Devices upon the Snow. Their Sleds were well contrived in the &s;hape of <HI>Griffins, Tigers, Swans, Scallop Shells, Dol|phins, Peacocks,</HI> and the like Curio&s;ities, cared, painted, and gilded. The Lady &s;its in one of the&s;e, richly habited in Velvet, lined with rich Furrs, &s;et off with Lace and Jewels, in a Velvet Cap lined with Sables. The Sled is drawn by a Hor&s;e, dre&s;&s;ed up with Feathers of all colours, and Bells hanging about him, a pair of Stags horns behind his head, Ribbons and other Ornaments: one or more Pages ride by on Hor&s;e|back with Torches in their hands. And after this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">anner they per|form their Cour&s;e upon the frozen Snow about the &s;treets of <HI>Vienna,</HI> in the night, with good &s;peed one after another. A Gentleman &s;its behind the Lady and guides the Hor&s;e. But the Fro&s;t breaking up put an end to the&s;e Recreations. The Fro&s;t began and ended here the &s;ame day that it began and ended in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Fe&s;tivity of <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> was ob&s;erved much after the &s;ame Man|ner, Ceremonies, and Solemnities, as in <HI>Italy.</HI> On <HI>Christmas-day</HI> the Emperor dined publickly, attended with many Nobles and great Per|&s;ons, and three remarkable low Dwar&s;s. Upon St. <HI>Stephen</HI>'s day he went to the Cathedral of St. <HI>Stephen,</HI> and went up to the Altar, kneeled, and ki&s;&s;ed the Plate whereon the <HI>Hostia</HI> had lain. At the <HI>Epiphany</HI> or <HI>Twelfth-tide,</HI> the old cu&s;tom of choo&s;ing King and Queen was ob|&s;erved at Court. Count <HI>Le&s;ly</HI> happened to be King, the Emperor laid the Cloth, and the Empre&s;s filled out Wine, together with other old Cu&s;toms, Fetched perhaps in part from ancienter times, <HI>Saturnalium diebus, mos Romanis, praebere &s;ervis convivium &s;ic ut ip&s;i officia &s;erv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rum obirent.</HI></P>
<P>Before <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> there was extraordinary mirth and jollity at the Court upon occa&s;ion of a Marriage: For Count <HI>Serau,</HI> Governor of <HI>Gratz</HI> in <HI>Styria,</HI> married a natural Daughter of <HI>Philip</HI> the Fourth, King of <HI>Spain,</HI> which was ob&s;erved with many noble Solemnities and Bra|veries. And the Nobility and Ladies were &s;o &s;ub&s;tantially &s;plendid, that I was much &s;urprized thereat.</P>
<P>This was followed by a Funeral Solemnity for the Count of <HI>Draun,</HI> who was Colonel of the Forces in <HI>Vienna,</HI> and who had one of the no|ble&s;t Hou&s;es in the City; his Corps was brought out of <HI>Italy,</HI> and in|terred in the <HI>Dominican</HI> Church, where he formerly built a very fair Altar; there was rai&s;ed for him a <HI>Ca&s;trum Doloris,</HI> hand&s;omly contrived and &s;et round with white Wax Torches and Candles.</P>
<P>While I was in <HI>Vien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">a,</HI> the Empre&s;s <HI>Margarita</HI> was delivered of a Daughter, which was Chri&s;tned by the name of <HI>Maria, Antonina, Jo&s;e|pha,</HI>

<P>During my &s;tay here, the Election was in readine&s;s for a King of <HI>Po|land,</HI> after the voluntary re&s;ignation of that Crown by King <HI>Ca&s;imir;</HI> and Couriers often pa&s;&s;ed between that Country and this. There were Competitors the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI>'s Son, the Duke of <HI>Newburg,</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Lorrain.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> moved actively for the Duke of <HI>New|burg,</HI> the Emperor for the Prince of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> who was then at <HI>Vi nna,</HI> in great favour with the Emperor, who greatly promoted his intere&s;t; a Per&s;on of great e&s;teem, and who if General <HI>Lub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">mirski</HI> had been li|ving, who was his intimate Friend, in all probability might have ob|tained the Crown; and thereupon it was conceived that he &s;hould have married the Emperor's Si&s;ter.

&s;peaks largely of the fi&s;hing for them in <HI>Ister.</HI> I was at the fi&s;hing places for <HI>Hau&s;ons</HI> in <HI>Sch&uuml;t</HI> I&s;land, between <HI>Pre&s;burg</HI> and <HI>Komard,</HI> for they come not u&s;ually higher, e&s;pecially in &s;hoals; and it is much that they come &s;o high, for they are conceived to come out of the <HI>Euxine-&s;ea,</HI> and &s;o up the &s;tream. They eat them both fre&s;h and &s;alt|ed; they ta&s;te mo&s;t like <HI>Sturgeon.</HI> It is a Cartilagineous Fi&s;h, con&s;i&s;t|ing of gri&s;tles, and they have a hollow nervous chord all down the back, which being dried &s;erves for a whip. When they fi&s;h for them they blow a Horn or Trumpet and know where they go by the moving of the water. From <HI>Venice</HI> they are &s;upplied with Oy&s;ters, with &s;alt <HI>Sturgeon,</HI> and &s;ometimes with red <HI>Herrings,</HI> and great variety of other Fi&s;hes pickled up: as al&s;o with <HI>Oranges, Limons,</HI> and other Fruits. Ob&s;erving much freedom, mu&s;ick, and jollity in the City. I won|dered how they could content them&s;elves without Plays, for there were few while I was there, till the Players came hither out of <HI>Saxony,</HI> and a|cted here for a time. The Je&s;uites would &s;ometimes entertain the Emperor and Empre&s;s with a Comedy at their College; and I had once the favour to be at one when they were pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>But they have Dancing and Fencing often, and every <HI>Holy-day</HI> af|ter dinner, the people flock to &s;ome Inns where there is Dancing in the inward Rooms, and Fencing and Playing of Prizes upon a Stage in the Yard; and at the Windows, or from the Galleries, they behold the Fencers playing at &s;everal Weapons; and commonly pa&s;s the re&s;t of the day in delights and merry Company.</P>
<P>In Trea&s;on and high Crimes they cut off the right Hand of the Ma|lefactor, and his Head immediately after. I &s;aw a Woman beheaded &s;itting in a Chair, the Executioner &s;triking off her Head with a Fore|blow, &s;he behaved her &s;elf well, and was accompanied unto the Mar|ket place by the <HI>Confraternity</HI> of the <HI>Dead,</HI> who have a charitable care of &s;uch Per&s;ons, and are not of any Religious Order, but <HI>Lay-men;</HI> among whom al&s;o in this place there are many Fraternities and Orders, as of the <HI>Holy Virgin,</HI> of the <HI>Holy Cro&s;s,</HI> and others. Another per&s;on al&s;o executed after the &s;ame manner; as &s;oon as his head fell to the ground, while the Body was in the Chair, a man run &s;peedily with a Pot in his hand, and filling it with the Blood, yet &s;pouting out of his Neck, he pre&s;ently drank it off, and ran away; and this he did as a Remedy again&s;t the <HI>Falling-Sickne&s;s.</HI> I have read of &s;ome who have approved the &s;ame Medicine; and heard of others who have done the like in <HI>Germany.</HI> And <HI>Cel&s;us</HI> takes notice, that in his time &s;ome Epileptical per&s;ons did drink the Blood of the <HI>Gladiatours.</HI> But many Phy&s;icians have, in all times, abominated that Medicine. Nor did I &s;tay afterwards &s;o long as to know the effect thereof, as to the intended cure. But mo&s;t men looked upon it as of great uncertainty: and of all men the Jews, who &s;uffer no Blood to come into their Lips, mu&s;t mo&s;t di&s;like it.</P>
<P>At <HI>Pre&s;burg</HI> they have a &s;trange way of Execution, &s;till u&s;ed at <HI>Metz,</HI> and &s;ome other places, by a Maid, or Engine like a Maid finely dre&s;&s;ed up with her hands before her. The Malefactor &s;alutes her fir&s;t, and then retires. But at his &s;econd &s;alute &s;he opens her hands and cuts his Heart in &s;under.</P>
<P>Though the Winter was &s;harp, yet the advantage of Stoves and ly|ing between two Feather-beds made it tolerable: For they u&s;e Stoves
<PB N="156" REF="91">
here as in other parts of <HI>Germany,</HI> where they lodge and eat in Stoves; and great Per&s;ons have Stoves in the Church, or &s;uch as look into the Church. There are Stoves al&s;o in the publick Schools where Lectures are read. And this way of lying between two Feather-beds, with a neat laced &s;heet &s;pread over, is more convenient in a cold Country, than mo&s;t others they make u&s;e of. For in the common Inns in <HI>Ger|many</HI> they generally &s;leep upon Straw, and al&s;o in <HI>Hungary</HI> almo&s;t eve|ry where; and more Ea&s;terly upon the ground, &s;preading a Carpet or Saddle-cloth under them: and more Northerly they content them|&s;elves with the Skins of Bea&s;ts, <HI>Bears, Elks,</HI> or the like; upon which they &s;leep in the night. Tho&s;e that &s;leep lowe&s;t are coole&s;t in a Stove; tho&s;e that lie upon Tables, Benches, or higher, are more expo&s;ed to the heat. The Citizens of <HI>Vienna</HI> are well attired, and u&s;e Furs very much The Women wear a high Velvet Bonnet, lined or faced therewith. The Place &s;eemed to be healthful; but they &s;peak much of the <HI>Colica Austriaca,</HI> as an Endemical and Local Di&s;ea&s;e, very hardly yielding unto good <HI>Medicines.</HI> They &s;peak good <HI>German</HI> at the Court and in the Ci|ty; but the Common &amp; Country people &s;eemed to &s;peak grumblingly, and be&s;ides their accent, have divers words different from other parts.</P>
<P>They have a Cu&s;tom upon St. <HI>Nicholas-day</HI> to put &s;ome &s;mall Gift into the Childrens &s;hooes; among other things they put in Medals and Dol|lars made of paper and flour, gilded and &s;ilvered over, yet &s;carce worth a penny. They &s;ell <HI>Trochies</HI> or <HI>Tablets</HI> in the markets, made of the pulp of the Fruit of <HI>Hip-briar,</HI> made &s;harp with <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>Sulphur,</HI> very refre&s;hing. Some carry about them a <HI>Thunder-stone</HI> as a defence again&s;t Thunder: and they rub their Childrens Gums with a <HI>Wolf's</HI> tooth in&s;tead of <HI>Coral.</HI></P>
<P>When I was at <HI>Venice,</HI> in the time of the <HI>Carnival,</HI> I ob&s;erved many Recreations and Shews, as Rope-dancing, flying down the Rope, cut|ing off Bulls-necks with Swords, and many other. But at <HI>Vienna</HI> a nota|ble trick which I &s;aw there, plea&s;ed me much: A man of a middle Sta|ture laid down upon his back, and a heavy Anvil was placed upon his Brea&s;t, as much as two men could well li&s;t, then two other men with great Hammers laid on, until they had given almo&s;t an hun|dred blows, and cut in &s;under a great Hor&s;hooe of iron, about half an inch thick.</P>
<P>Here is no Chri&s;tian Religion publickly permitted but the <HI>Ro|man,</HI> and therefore tho&s;e of the <HI>Prote&s;tant,</HI> and <HI>Reformed Religion</HI> are fain to re&s;ort to <HI>Pre&s;burg,</HI> Forty miles off, for which they have &s;ome convenience by the <HI>Danube,</HI> and a <HI>Coach</HI> which goes every day. In the time of <HI>Maximilian</HI> the Second, they were permitted the Ex|erci&s;e of their Religion in the Church of the <HI>Holy Cro&s;s,</HI> in the Ci|ty of <HI>Vienna.</HI> But afterwards were prohibited by <HI>Rodolphus</HI> the Se|cond. The Emperor <HI>Matthias</HI> gave them permi&s;&s;ion to meet at <HI>Her|nals,</HI> a little more than an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> mile from <HI>Vienna;</HI> and gave leave to their <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> to come into the City, and there to <HI>chri&s;ten, mar|ry, baptize,</HI> and <HI>vi&s;it</HI> the &s;ick. From which time they encrea&s;ed very much, till <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Second, returning from the Battel of <HI>Prague,</HI> ba|ni&s;hed their <HI>Mini&s;ter</HI> from <HI>Vienna,</HI> and <HI>Arnolds,;</HI> &s;ent the <HI>Freyherr Jorger,</HI> to whom the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Arnolds</HI> belonged, Pri&s;oner unto <HI>Lintz;</HI> and never gave over till he had taken away their Privileges and Free|dom of meeting publickly in any part of <HI>lower Au&s;tria.</HI></P>

But here are no &s;mall number of <HI>Jews,</HI> who have a di&s;tinct Habita|tion a&s;&s;igned them over the Water. They have al&s;o a Street allowed them in the City for the day time, but they mu&s;t all depart at night be|yond the River into the Suburbs.</P>
<P>They are much di&s;ta&s;ted by the Citizens and Trade&s;men, and the Scholars agree but ill with them. While I was at <HI>Vienna</HI> there was a quarrel between them to an high degree. For the <HI>Scholars</HI> a&s;&s;aulted the <HI>Jews</HI> Town, beat, wounded, and threw divers of them into the Ri|ver. Divers <HI>Scholars</HI> were wounded, &s;ome killed, and al&s;o &s;ome Soul|diers, who were commanded out to compo&s;e the Fray: and the <HI>Jews</HI> Town was guarded many days by the Souldiers of the City. This begot &s;uch ill Blood, and Complaints, that a good number of the <HI>Jews</HI> were to be bani&s;hed at a certain day. The <HI>Jews,</HI> to ingratiate with the Empre&s;s, then with Child, pre&s;ented her with a noble <HI>Silver Cradle,</HI> but &s;he would not receive it; and there was great danger of the general bani&s;hment of them when I left that City, which was afterwards effected, they being &s;everely prohibited from living, not only at <HI>Vien|na,</HI> but in any part of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> where there were formerly whole Vil|lages of them, &s;o as they were forced to betake them&s;elves into the Do|minions of the <HI>Turk,</HI> unto <HI>Venice,</HI> into <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Bohemia.</HI> They being not permitted to dwell in the Neighbour Countries of <HI>Hungary,</HI> &s;ubject to the Emperor, <HI>Styria,</HI> or <HI>Carinthia.</HI> But many of them went to <HI>Buda</HI> and were be&s;ieged there in the year 1684 and becoming ob&s;tinate haters of the <HI>Germans,</HI> they a&s;&s;i&s;ted the <HI>Turks</HI> with their Pur&s;es and with what el&s;e they were able to maintain the Town again&s;t the Imperial Forces.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s they &s;eemed u&s;eful to <HI>Vienna</HI> for ready accommodati|on of any thing, either by &s;ale or exchange, but the people looked with an ill eye upon them, as taking away much of their Trade and Employment. They al&s;o looked upon them as u&s;ele&s;s to them in war for the defence of the place as Souldiers; and were not without &s;ome jealou&s;ie that they held Corre&s;pondence with the <HI>Turks,</HI> and gave them Intelligence of their Affairs. Yet the Souldiery dealt much with them, and Captains for the &s;uddain habiting, furni&s;hing, and ac|commodating of their Companies. And dining one day with a Commander at a <HI>Jew</HI>'s Hou&s;e, among&s;t other Di&s;cour&s;e, I asked the <HI>Jew</HI> concerning the <HI>ten Tribes,</HI> and where they were? He &s;aid <HI>they were far off in</HI> A&s;ia, <HI>b yond a great Lake which was continually &s;tormy, and &s;carce pa&s;&s;able, but upon their Sabbath-day, upon which days the Jews do not willingly travel.</HI></P>
<P>I have &s;een their <HI>Circumci&s;ion</HI> at <HI>Rome, Padua,</HI> and other parts. Their <HI>Phy&s;icians,</HI> ordinarily profe&s;s great skill in <HI>&V;rines;</HI> and the com|mon people re&s;ort unto them rather than unto <HI>Christians,</HI> and are &s;o credulous, and have &s;uch an opinion of them, that they might be made to believe they have &s;ome old <HI>Receipts</HI> of King <HI>Solomon.</HI></P>
<P>There are many <HI>Jews</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> yet they &s;eem to me to be in greater numbers in <HI>Germany.</HI> In <HI>Amsterdam</HI> they are al&s;o grown very nu|merous.

But the greate&s;t number &s;urely is in <HI>Prague.</HI></P>

<P>La&s;tly, when I con&s;ider the old &s;trength of <HI>Vienna,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting in an old <HI>wall</HI> and a deep <HI>Ditch,</HI> I cannot much wonder that <HI>Matthias Corvinus,</HI> King of <HI>Hungary,</HI> took this City. And I mu&s;t a&s;cribe it, under God, unto the &s;ingular valour and re&s;olution of the Defendants, that <HI>Solyman</HI> the Magnificent, with two hundred thou&s;and men, was not able to take it, and though he made large breaches, could never enter it, but lo&s;t &s;ome thou&s;ands at an A&s;&s;ault, and departed at la&s;t with the lo&s;s of a great part of his Army.

<P>It would be a &s;ad lo&s;s for <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> if this place were in the hands of the <HI>Turk;</HI> and no man knows where he would re&s;t. If he &s;hould begin with this place, and take it, the &s;trong holds of <HI>Rab, Ko|mara,</HI> and <HI>Leopold&s;tadt</HI> would want their &s;upport, and &s;oon fall into his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and if he were Lord of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> a great part of <HI>Germany</HI> would lie bare unto him: and probably it would not be long before he vi&s;i|ted <HI>Italy,</HI> into which Country he would then find many ways.

A large Town, and much frequented, not far from the River <HI>Albis</HI> or <HI>Elbe,</HI> of e&s;pecial note for the <HI>Silver Mines</HI> about it: The <HI>Hells</HI> near it are not high, and con&s;equently the Mines are not &s;o deep as tho&s;e of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and &s;ome others in <HI>Germany;</HI> yet &s;ome are above &s;eventy or eighty <HI>Fathoms.</HI> They have wrought at the&s;e <HI>Mines</HI> &s;even hundred years, and there are about thirty of them. I went down into that which was fir&s;t digged, but afterwards le&s;t for a long time, but they work there now again, it is called the <HI>Cotna,</HI> or <HI>Auf|der Cotten,</HI> upon the <HI>Cotten,</HI> or <HI>Coat-hill;</HI> and as the Story goes a <HI>Monk</HI> walking over this Hill found a kind of a <HI>Silver Tree</HI> &s;ticking to his Garment, which was the occa&s;ion that they afterwards digged and built the&s;e <HI>Mines,</HI> and the place retains the name of <HI>Cottenberg.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Mine</HI> into which I de&s;cended near the Town, is but nineteen <HI>Fathoms</HI> deep; the chief <HI>Vein</HI> of the <HI>Ore</HI> runs South, and is about a foot in breadth: the <HI>Ore</HI> holds or contains in it <HI>Silver</HI> and <HI>Cop|per,</HI> &s;o that out of an hundred pound weight of <HI>Ore,</HI> they ordinarily get an Ounce of <HI>Silver,</HI> and eight, nine, or ten ounces or more of <HI>Copper,</HI> even to pounds, but it is not well known, for the <HI>Copper-works</HI> are the Emperors. The <HI>&V;ndertakers</HI> get out what <HI>Silver</HI> they can, and afterwards &s;ell the <HI>Ore,</HI> unto the Emperors Officers; but &s;ome <HI>Ore</HI> is &s;o rich as to contain eight or nine ounces of <HI>Silver.</HI> A blew <HI>Earth</HI> which they meet with in digging, affords the be&s;t hopes of <HI>Ore.</HI> Two men lately peri&s;hed in this <HI>Mine,</HI> having made a fire in it, being either choaked with the &s;moak, or, as they thought, by the poy&s;onous ex|halations forced out of the Minerals by the fire.

<P>This great place con&s;i&s;ts of three Towns, named the <HI>Old,</HI> the <HI>New,</HI> and the <HI>Kleine Seitten,</HI> or <HI>le&s;&s;er Town.</HI> The <HI>old Town</HI> lies upon the Ea&s;t of the River <HI>Muldau,</HI> is very populous, full of Buildings, private and publick.

<P>The <HI>new Town</HI> is large, and together with the River, encompa&s;&s;es the <HI>old,</HI> and is divided from it by a large <HI>Trench</HI> or <HI>Ditch,</HI> into which they can let in the River.

They are now making <HI>Bastions</HI> about the <HI>Town</HI> at one end thereof; there is al|&s;o a <HI>Citadel,</HI> but not fini&s;hed, at <HI>Wi&s;&s;eraht,</HI> or <HI>Wi&s;&s;egrade,</HI> formerly<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince&s;s <HI>Libu&s;&s;a.</HI></NOTE> the Seat of the Princes of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and al&s;o of the famous Prince&s;s <HI>Libu&s;&s;a,</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Crocus,</HI> and Wife unto <HI>Primi&s;laus.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Kleine Seitten,</HI> or <HI>le&s;&s;er Prague,</HI> far exceeds the other for plea|&s;antne&s;s and beauty of Buildings and fair Palaces.

A great part of this Town lies high, and upon the Hill &s;tands <HI>Hrat|&s;chin</HI> or <HI>&V;pper Prague,</HI> and a Summer Hou&s;e of the Emperors, be&s;ides a Magnificent Palace of the Emperors, as King of <HI>Bohemia;</HI> and by it a fair <HI>Cathedral Church</HI> dedicated to St. <HI>Veit,</HI> fir&s;t built by St. <HI>Wen|ce&s;laus,</HI> Duke of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> 923. from whence the Town and River is be&s;t viewed.

The Stable is large, and worth the &s;eeing, wherein there is a <HI>Marble Pillar</HI> between each Hor&s;e, and for e|very Hor&s;e there is placed in a niche of the Wall a Rack of Steel, and Manger of Marble, and over his Head hangs a Picture of the Hor&s;e, as big as the Life, with his Name under it.

<P>Some have thought that the be&s;t <HI>high German</HI> is &s;poken in this part of <HI>Prague;</HI> and there living &s;o many of the Nobility and great Per|&s;ons, it is not to be wondred at, that their Language is better than ordina|ry.

The common &s;ort of People are boy&s;terous, rough, and quarrel&s;ome, e&s;pecially in drink, whereto they are too much addicted. The Nobility and Gen|try are civil and kind unto Strangers. There are many great Fami|lies of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e Nobility, among which that of <HI>Ro&s;enberg</HI> and <HI>Popel</HI> is an|cient, and of high e&s;teem. Since the unhappy accepting of the Crown by <HI>Frederick</HI> Count <HI>Palatine,</HI> and the ill &s;ucce&s;s upon it, there hath been a great alteration in this Country, both as to People and their Manners; for thereupon many thou&s;ands left the Kingdom, and many who remained, turned their Religion.

<P>Dr. <HI>Luther</HI>'s Holiday was kept when I was there. The chief Church is very fair: They preach every morning at &s;even a Clock. The <HI>Lu|theran</HI> women mourn in <HI>white,</HI> as others do in <HI>Black;</HI> and the woman of the Hou&s;e doth ordinarily &s;ay Grace in&s;tead of the man.

<P>Leaving this noble place, I took not the neare&s;t Road, but turned out of the way unto <HI>Freiberg,</HI> a place noted for <HI>Silver Mines;</HI> whereof I<NOTE PLACE="marg">Freiberg.</NOTE> had read &s;omething in <HI>Agricola,</HI> and heard very much in the&s;e parts. About an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> mile or two from <HI>Freiberg,</HI> there are many remarka|ble <HI>Mines.</HI> I took notice of three of them: One called <HI>Auff den hohen berg,</HI> or <HI>upon the high Hill,</HI> which is the deepe&s;t in the&s;e parts, as being &s;eventy &s;even of their <HI>Fathoms</HI> deep; each of their <HI>Fathoms</HI> contains twelve of their <HI>Ells,</HI> and three of their <HI>Ells</HI> makes one of our <HI>Fa|thoms.</HI> So that the depth of this <HI>Mine</HI> exceeds any of tho&s;e wherein I was in <HI>Hungary.</HI> There is another <HI>Mine</HI> called <HI>Himmelfur&s;t,</HI> or the <HI>Prince of Heaven,</HI> wherein not long &s;ince there was <HI>Ore</HI> found &s;o rich, as in an hundred pounds weight to contain an hundred and thirty Marks of <HI>Silver,</HI> or &s;ixty five pounds in the hundred, but there was not much of it: And where the <HI>Veins</HI> are riche&s;t, they are ob&s;erved to be thinne&s;t, about two fingers broad; but the ordinary <HI>Ore</HI> is but poor, holding an ounce, or an ounce and half, in an hundred pounds weight; and if it holds but half an ounce they work it. Nor is this much to be wondered at, for in the va&s;t rich <HI>Mines</HI> of <HI>Peru</HI> and <HI>Chili,</HI> they will work the <HI>Silver Ore</HI> which contains four or five ounces in a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Silver Mines&punc;</NOTE> hundred pound weight; and ten or twelve ounces is the ordinary rate of the common <HI>Ore</HI> of that rich Mountain of <HI>Poto&s;i,</HI> out of which Hill alone, if we believe <HI>Albero Alon&s;o Barba,</HI> Curate of the Pari&s;h of St. <HI>Bernard</HI> in that City, there hath been more <HI>Silver</HI> taken than would cover all <HI>Mi&s;nia</HI> over and over: For thus he &s;aith, Poto&s;i <HI>hath already yielded between four and five hundred Millions of pieces of Eight.</HI> A quantity &s;ufficient to make &s;uch another Hill of <HI>Silver:</HI> It is hard to form a conception equal unto &s;o exorbitant a heap of Riches; but the better to help our imagination herein, I know, that if the Ground were covered with &s;o many pieces of Eight, laid as clo&s;e to one another as is po&s;&s;ible, they would take up the &s;pace of &s;ixty Leagues &s;quare.</P>
<P>Here at <HI>Freiberg</HI> they have many ways to open the <HI>Ore</HI> whereby it may be melted; as by <HI>Lead</HI> and a &s;ort of <HI>Silver Ore</HI> which holds <HI>Lead</HI> in it. They have al&s;o <HI>Sulphur Ore</HI> found here, which after it is

<P>This is peculiar in their working, that they burn the pounded and wa&s;hed <HI>Ore</HI> in the <HI>Roa&s;thearth,</HI> before they melt it in the <HI>Smeltzoven,</HI> or <HI>melting Furnace.</HI></P>
<P>At tho&s;e <HI>Mines</HI> of <HI>Hungary</HI> where I was, they u&s;ed not the <HI>Virgula divina,</HI> or forked Hazel, to find out <HI>Silver Ore</HI> or hidden Trea&s;ure in the Earth; and I &s;hould little depend thereon: but here they have an e|&s;teem of it. And I ob&s;erved the u&s;e thereof, and the manner how they did it. But I &s;hall omit the De&s;cription of it, becau&s;e it is &s;et down in divers Books, and it cannot be &s;o well de&s;cribed as &s;hown to the Eye.</P>

The <HI>Mines</HI> are cold where the out|ward Air comes in; but where not, warm. The greate&s;t trouble they have is by du&s;t, which &s;poils their <HI>Lungs</HI> and <HI>Stomachs,</HI> and frets their <HI>Skins.</HI> But they are not &s;o much troubled with water; and have ve|ry<NOTE PLACE="marg">Brim&s;tone Mines.</NOTE> good <HI>Engines</HI> to draw the water out.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sulphur</HI> or <HI>Brim&s;tone Ore</HI> which is found here, is al&s;o rich; it is hard and &s;tony, as other <HI>Ores</HI> are; that which hath <HI>red &s;pots</HI> is ac|counted the be&s;t. They u&s;e a peculiar <HI>Furnace</HI> to melt the <HI>Brim&s;tone</HI> from the <HI>Ore;</HI> &s;ome whereof yields three pounds of <HI>Sulphur,</HI> out of an hundred weight of <HI>Ore,</HI> which as it melts, runs out of the <HI>Furnace</HI> into water, or the Exhalations from the <HI>Ore</HI> near or in the Fire, are con|den&s;ed into <HI>Brim&s;tone</HI> by the Surface of the Water placed to receive it; this is once again melted and purified.

<P>Now having made &s;o long a walk in <HI>Germany,</HI> I mu&s;t confe&s;s I re|turned with a better opinion of the Country, than I had before of it; and cannot but think it very con&s;iderable in many things. The Ri|vers thereof are noble, and &s;eem to exceed tho&s;e of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy.</HI> Of the Rivers of <HI>Italy,</HI> the <HI>Padus</HI> or <HI>Po,</HI> is the mo&s;t con&s;iderable, which notwith&s;tanding, hath no very long cour&s;e, before it runs into the

<HI>Adriatick Sea.</HI> And <HI>Italy</HI> being divided by the <HI>Appennine-bills,</HI> run|ing from We&s;t to Ea&s;t, the Rivers which ari&s;e from either &s;ide, cannot be long, neither on the South-&s;ide, before they run into the <HI>Mediter|ranean,</HI> as the <HI>Arno, Garigliano,</HI> and others: Nor on the North &s;ide, before they run into the <HI>Adriatick,</HI> or the <HI>Po.</HI></P>
<P>The chief Rivers of <HI>France,</HI> as the <HI>Loyre,</HI> the <HI>Seine,</HI> the <HI>Rho&s;ne,</HI> and the <HI>Garonne,</HI> I cannot but highly commend, having pa&s;&s;ed upon them for divers days. There are al&s;o four great Rivers in <HI>Germany;</HI> the <HI>Danube,</HI> the <HI>Rhine,</HI> the <HI>Elbe,</HI> and the <HI>Oder,</HI> but none of <HI>France</HI> &s;eem comparable unto the <HI>Rhine</HI> and <HI>Danube.

<P>The great number of populous, large, and hand&s;ome Cities, doth afford great content unto a <HI>Traveller</HI> in <HI>Germany;</HI> for be&s;ides about Sixty &s;ix free Imperial Cities, there are many more of good note be|longing to particular Princes, and divers highly priviledged. And &s;ure|ly a true E&s;timation of the Cities and Towns of the&s;e days, cannot be duly made from the Accounts and De&s;criptions thereof le&s;t an hundred years &s;ince or more, for &s;ince tho&s;e times, Buildings have been better modelled and ordered; Fortifications and Out-works more regularly contrived; Convents and Publick Hou&s;es more neatly and commodi|ou&s;ly built; and the fair Colleges and Churches of the <HI>Je&s;uites,</HI> which are now to be &s;een in mo&s;t, do much &s;et off the Beauty of great Places. Every where we meet with great and populous <HI>Towns Villages; Castles, Seats</HI> of the <HI>Nobility, Plains, Fore&s;ts,</HI> and plea&s;ant <HI>Woods.</HI> And be|&s;ides the &s;atisfaction we may have from Objects above ground, we may find no &s;mall content in the wonders thereof under it, in <HI>Mines, Mi|nerals</HI> almo&s;t of all &s;orts, of <HI>Gold, Silver, Copper, Iron, Tinn, Lead, Quick&s;ilver, Antimony, Coal, Salt, Sulphur, Cadmia,</HI> and others, where there are al&s;o &s;ingular <HI>Artificers</HI> and <HI>Workmen,</HI> in the &s;everal Artifices thereof. Con|ver&s;ation with the People is ea&s;ie, they behaving them&s;elves without much Formality, and are plain dealing and tru&s;ty, &s;o that a <HI>Traveller</HI> needs not to be &s;o &s;ollicitous and heedful of what he hath, as in &s;ome other Countries, which are e&s;teemed of greater Civility. The Women are generally well-complexioned, &s;ober, and grave, and they have not yet learned the cu&s;tom of their Neighbours of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> to admit of being &s;aluted by Men: faithful to their Husbands, and careful in the affairs of their Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>They make good provi&s;ion again&s;t the cold of their Country, by &s;leeping between two Feather-beds and Stoves.</P>
<P>The common <HI>Stoves</HI> in <HI>Inns,</HI> wherein there are for the mo&s;t part &s;everal Companies eating, drinking, and in the night &s;leeping, are con|venient, con&s;idering the great cold, or at lea&s;t tolerable; but they be|ing rooms clo&s;e &s;hut up, the &s;mell of the meat, and e&s;pecially of <HI>Cab|bage,</HI> an u&s;ual Di&s;h among&s;t them, makes them unplea&s;ant, &s;o that &s;ometimes I preferred the cour&s;e of hot Countries, while I called to mind, that in <HI>Province,</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> we drank frozen <HI>Julebs,</HI> which we di&s;&s;olved with the heat of our hands; &s;lept upon a &s;heet, on the out&s;ide of the Bed, with all the Windows of the Chamber open; and as we &s;ate at dinner, there was a Fann in the middle of the Room, hanging
<PB N="179" REF="109">
over our Heads, about two yards broad, which with a &s;tring was pull|ed backward and forward to cool us, and divers had Pans filled with Snow, to cool the &s;heets when they went into their Beds.</P>
<P><HI>Germany</HI> is a great <HI>Hive</HI> of men, and the mighty de&s;truction of men made by the la&s;t <HI>German</HI> wars, and by the Plague is &s;o repaired, that it is &s;carce di&s;cernible. They are fruitful, and full of Children: They are not exhau&s;ted by <HI>Sea,</HI> Colonies &s;ent forth, or by peopling <HI>American Countries&punc;</HI> but they have &s;ome con&s;umption by wars abroad, when they be at peace at home: few wars being made in other parts of <HI>Eu|rope,</HI> wherein there are not &s;ome Regiments of <HI>Germans;</HI> the People being naturally Martial, and per&s;ons well de&s;cended, very aver&s;e from a Trading cour&s;e of Life.</P>
<P>While I read in <HI>Tacitus</HI> of the old barbarous and rude State of <HI>Ger|many,</HI> how poorly they lived, that they had their Hou&s;es at a di&s;tance from one another; how ignorant they were in Arts; and it was doubted whether their Country afforded <HI>Mines;</HI> that they lived by ex|change of things, making little or no u&s;e of money, and the like, I may ju&s;tly wonder to behold the pre&s;ent advance and improvement in all commendable Arts, Learning, Civility, &s;plendid and hand&s;ome Cities and Habitations, and the general face of things incredibly altered &s;ince tho&s;e ancient times; and cannot but approve the expre&s;&s;ion of a Learned Man, though long &s;ince, <HI>That if</HI> Ariovi&s;tus, Civilis, <HI>and tho&s;e old famous men of</HI> Germany, <HI>&s;hould revive in their Country again, and look up to Heaven, beholding the Con&s;tellations of the Bears, and other Stars, they might probably acknowledge that the&s;e were the &s;ame Stars which they were wont to behold; but if they &s;hould look downward, and well view the face of all things, they would imagine them&s;elves to be in a new World, and never acknowledge this to have been their Country.</HI></P>

<P>_I Travelled &s;ome years &s;ince, between <HI>Venice</HI> and <HI>Genoa,</HI> through many Countries of early Civility, &s;eated in the middle of the temperate Zone, in a fruitful and happy Climate; affording plentifully all Nece&s;&s;aries for Life; and through Countries which have not only been con&s;iderable for their copious production of Corn, Fruit, Silk, Wine and Oyl, but al&s;o for having been very fortunate in all Ages, for bringing into the World Per&s;ons of great Fame and Renown, who have rendred this Tract of Earth more than ordinarily remarkable for great Actions in all times. The memory of which is &s;till pre&s;erved not only in their Writings, but al&s;o in their &s;plendid Buildings, and Antiquities; though no parts have ta&s;ted more deeply of the dangerous variety of fortune, the&s;e having &s;uffered the frequent Incur&s;ions of many fierce and warlike Nations.

<P>And indeed many of the Peaks of the <HI>Apennines</HI> are very high, and &s;ome of them covered with &s;now; and others are rocky, but in gene|ral they are earthy, muddy, or full of clay; whereby they &s;tain and tincture the <HI>Tiber</HI> and many other Rivers which flow through them, and give an umber, brown, or dirty yellow colour to tho&s;e &s;treams, which being al&s;o for the mo&s;t part very &s;wift, the <HI>Apennine</HI> Rivers hereby lo&s;e much of their grace and beauty, and become al&s;o le&s;s &s;erviceable; and to &s;peak the truth, not navigable with any plea&s;ure: And this tincture which is communicated to them is of &s;o deep a Dye in many places, that it is not ea&s;ily altered or diluted, and I have &s;een divers Rivers run down from the <HI>Apennine</HI> with that force into the <HI>Adriatick,</HI> that the &s;tream or colour of them is perfectly di&s;tin|gui&s;hed a mile or two into the Sea, as if the Gulf of <HI>Venice</HI> were painted in tho&s;e places with a &s;treight yellow &s;troke for two miles together.</P>
<P>We were told that the name of the hill which we here pa&s;&s;ed o|ver was called, <HI>The Mountain of the Holy Cro&s;s,</HI> but the Mountain of the Cro&s;s, <HI>La montagne de la croix,</HI> much &s;poken of in the South part of <HI>France</HI> is one of the great Hills in the maritime <HI>Alpes,</HI> in one of the pa&s;&s;ages from <HI>Provence</HI> into <HI>Italy.</HI> The highe&s;t Mountain in the <HI>Apennine</HI> that I pa&s;&s;ed over, between <HI>Rome,</HI> and <HI>Loretto,</HI> was Mount <HI>Soma</HI> in <HI>&V;mbra;</HI> and the pa&s;&s;age which plea&s;ed me mo&s;t, was in the road from <HI>Turin,</HI> between <HI>Otagio</HI> and <HI>Genoa;</HI> where after &s;ome diffi|culty having got up to the top of the Mountains, we &s;aw <HI>Genoa,</HI> and the beautiful &s;uburbs of St. <HI>Pietro di Arena</HI> under us at nine miles di|&s;tance, and a va&s;t tract of Sea before us, the Ea&s;tern Coa&s;t on the left hand, and the We&s;tern on the right, and de&s;cended by a broad way, and by large Windings and Turnings, upon the bare marble rock, meeting great numbers of Mules, and Mulets to&s;&s;ing up their Nets about their no&s;es, which all together afforded an extraordinary pro|&s;pect. But this Mountain of the Holy Cro&s;s is not rocky but all green, and it being the latter end of <HI>April</HI> we de&s;cended with ea&s;e and plea&s;ure, and a good part of the way upon the gra&s;s, till we came to the Sea-&s;ide in the Evening, to <HI>Se&s;tri</HI> or <HI>Sestro</HI> called by <HI>Daute</HI> in his Purgatory, <HI>Si&s;teri,</HI> formerly <HI>Sege&s;ta,</HI> at pre&s;ent <HI>Se&s;tri di Levante,</HI> to di&s;tingui&s;h it from <HI>Se&s;tri di ponente,</HI> between <HI>Genoa</HI> and <HI>Savona:</HI> for the whole Coa&s;t of <HI>Genoa</HI> being divided into the Ea&s;t and the We&s;t, that which lyes between <HI>Genoa</HI> and <HI>Legorn</HI> is called <HI>La Riviera di Levante,</HI> and that between <HI>Genoa,</HI> and <HI>Provence, La Riviera di Ponente.</HI></P>
