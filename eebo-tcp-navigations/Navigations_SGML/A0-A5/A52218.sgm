<P>THE Committee of the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company and their Abettors having made &s;o great a noi&s;e on the <HI>Exchange</HI> la&s;t Week, of the advantageous Peace they had obtain'd of the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> by which the <HI>Notional Stock</HI> was rai&s;ed from 112. to 150. <HI>per Cent.</HI> And it being declared at the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Hou&s;e, That the Articles by the new <HI>Phirmaund</HI> (or <HI>Patent</HI>) &s;hould be Printed for General Satisfaction; It was with great Earne&s;t|ne&s;s expected; in hopes it would appear for the Honour and Advantage of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation. But in lieu thereof, there only appears in the <HI>Mondays</HI> Gazette a &s;imple Intimation, <HI>That a Peace is made, and that we enjoy the &s;ame, <HI>yea</HI> and greater Privileges than formerly.</HI></P>
<P>Now, That the Nation may be fully informed of the true State of the Mat|ter, and that Widows and other hone&s;t and well-meaning Per&s;ons, Strangers to the Management of the Company's Affairs may not be mi&s;led, and for the general Good and Service of all; An Exact Copy of the <HI>Phirmaund</HI> for the Bay of <HI>Bengale,</HI> which is one of the principal Ports in the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Dominions, is here pre&s;ented; as the Tran&s;lation is &s;ent to the Company from <HI>Surrat</HI> in the following Words.</P>
<P>[<HI>'Tis directed to</HI> Ibrahim Chaune, <HI>who is one of the</HI> Mogul<HI>'s great</HI> Governours, <HI>Dated the</HI> 27th. <HI>of</HI> April, <HI>in the</HI> 33d. <HI>Year of his Reign.</HI>]</P>

<P><HI>KNow this, That the Good Fortune of the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>hath directed them the Right way to end their Faults, they are &s;orry and a&s;hamed for what they have done, therefore have &s;ent their Vakeels</HI> [Factors] <HI>to our noble Court, with a Petition for a gracious</HI> Phirmaund <HI>to pardon their Faults; which the King, out of his great Favour and Mercy, always ready to pardon, doth freely forgive them; therefore his clear and un|&s;potted Order is &s;uch, which you are to ob&s;erve as you do his that you pray to, That &s;o &s;oon as this gracious</HI> Phirmaund <HI>reaches your hands, you &s;uffer no body in your Juri&s;di|ction to mole&s;t, hurt, or hinder the</HI> Engli&s;h Nation <HI>in their Bu&s;ine&s;s, but &s;uffer them to carry it on in the &s;ame manner as formerly.

<P>THis is the In&s;trument that &s;tands upon Record in the Court of that Great Prince, to the Eternal Infamy of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation; as the Effect of our mo&s;t unju&s;t and unaccountable War, whereby not only the Honour of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> (before in the highe&s;t E&s;teem,) but the Intere&s;t of the Company in particular, hath &s;uffered an Immen&s;e, and irreparable Damage; tho &s;ome few Managers) by unwarrantable and indirect Means, have gain'd prodigious E&s;tates. For, as to the Nation and Company, after the lo&s;s of &s;ix years Trade, and the de&s;truction of many con&s;iderable Ships, and the death of many hun|dreds of our be&s;t Seamen: The Condition on which we are now re-admitted to Trade, is, That full Re&s;titution be made to the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Subjects for all the Ships and Goods the Company have taken, according to the Accounts which &s;hall be given in by the <HI>Crannies</HI> [or <HI>Pur&s;ers</HI>] of the Ships taken by the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> And tho we cannot yet tell the certain Sum which mu&s;t be made good, We may &s;hrewdly ghe&s;s at it from the Evidence given in the Cau&s;e now depend|ing
<PB N="2" REF="2" MS="y">between Their Maje&s;ties and the Company, on account of tho&s;e Prizes, wherein a great number of Witne&s;&s;es have depo&s;ed to the value of above One Million Sterling; Be&s;ides which, they are likewi&s;e indebted in <HI>India,</HI> at no &s;mall Intere&s;t, above Three hundred thou&s;and Pounds more, and no le&s;s a Sum here at Home, on Bond, and for Freight and Demurrage: Whil&s;t all their Stock in <HI>England</HI> will not extend to di&s;charge their late made Dividend; nor all their Effects abroad, to load home one Third of the Shipping, now in <HI>India,</HI> be&s;ides the great Sums they owe to tho&s;e Ships for their Service and Demurrage; which is not only manife&s;t by the Liberty and Encouragement they give to private Men to return their particular E&s;tates on tho&s;e Bottoms, but e&s;pecially by the general Letter which accompanied the <HI>Phirmaund,</HI> written to the Company by their Factors at <HI>Surrat,</HI> whereby they earne&s;tly pre&s;s for a large and &s;peedy Supply to &s;upport and carry on the Trade.</P>
<P>In con&s;ideration of the&s;e exorbitant Impo&s;itions on the Nation, and from a true Affection to their Country, there are &s;ome Gentlemen and Merchants who have long applied their Thoughts to the re&s;toring this &s;o con&s;iderable a Trade, and in order thereto are prepared to lay before our Honourable Repre&s;entatives in Parliament at their next Se&s;&s;ion, a clear and ample Account by what ways and means the Credit and Intere&s;t of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation in <HI>India,</HI> hath been reduc'd to &s;o mi&s;erable a Condition, and in the interim they hope it may not be an unac|ceptable Service to the Publick, That they offer this brief Adverti&s;ement for Caution again&s;t the pre&s;umptuous Impo&s;itions of daring and arbitrary Men, who have of late Years encrea&s;ed their E&s;tates by the Ruin of their Fellow-Sub|jects, and have been the In&s;truments of this great Di&s;honour and Detriment to their Country.</P>
