<P>THE I&s;land of <HI>Brittain</HI> is of all others the mo&s;t famous, and has been accounted the greate&s;t in the World; it compre|hendeth all tho&s;e I&s;lands both great and le&s;s, which lie in compa&s;s about it, the length thereof from South to North (that is from <HI>Ly&s;ard</HI> Point in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> to the North of <HI>Scotland</HI>) is 624 miles, and the breadth thereof from the Lands end in <HI>Cornwall</HI> to the I&s;le of <HI>Thanet</HI> in <HI>Kent</HI> about 300 <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> miles; It is a Country always very temperate, and was highly e&s;teemed by the <HI>Romans,</HI> as appears by what hath been &s;aid concerning it, by one of their Orators, who calls it, the happy and mo&s;t fortunate I&s;land, endued by nature with all the ble&s;&s;ings of Heaven and Earth, in that therein is neither extream cold in Winter, nor &s;corching heats in Summer, and that which is mo&s;t com|fortable, <HI>long daies, and very light&s;ome nights;</HI> wherein there is &s;uch an abundance of Grain, as may &s;uffice both for Bread and Wine; the Woods thereof are without wild Bea&s;ts, the Fields without noy&s;om Serpents, but therein are va&s;t numbers of Milch Bea&s;ts, and Sheep weighed down with their own Fleeces.

<P>As to the name <HI>Brittain</HI> there is no great certainty of its Original; that which hath pa&s;&s;ed for currant in for|mer times (when almo&s;t all Nations did pretend to be of <HI>Trojan</HI> Race) was, that it took this name from <HI>Brutus,</HI> affirmed to be the Son of <HI>Silvius,</HI> Grand-Child of <HI>Aeneas,</HI> and third King of the <HI>Latines</HI> of the <HI>Trojan</HI> Blood, which <HI>Brutus</HI> having unfortunately killed his Father, and there|upon flying from <HI>Italy</HI> with his Friends and followers, after a long Voyage, and many wandrings, is &s;aid to have fallen upon this I&s;land, and to have conquered here a race of Giants, and having given unto it the name of <HI>Brittain,</HI> to leave the Soveraignty thereof to his po&s;teri|ty, who quietly enjoyed the &s;ame, till &s;ubdued by the <HI>Romans;</HI> but this Tradition has been &s;ince laid a&s;ide, as altogether fabulous, &s;ince the <HI>Roman</HI> Hi&s;torians never mention either <HI>Brutus</HI> or the Giants, <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> telling us, that he found the <HI>Brittains</HI> under many Kings, and ne|ver under the command of one &s;ole Prince, but in times of Danger; it is therefore more probable that it was de|rived from <HI>Britt,</HI> which in the <HI>Britti&s;h</HI> Language &s;igni|fies <HI>Painted,</HI> and the word <HI>Tain</HI> a Nation, agreeable to the cu&s;tom of the Ancient <HI>Brittains,</HI> who u&s;ed to di&s;colour and paint their Bodies, that they might &s;eem more ter|rible in the Eyes of their Enemies, &s;uch as the <HI>Romans</HI> called afterwards <HI>Picts,</HI> or Painted Men; other particu|lars may be ob&s;erved in the de&s;cription of tho&s;e parts into which it is now divided, that is, 1. <HI>England.</HI> 2. <HI>Wales.</HI> 3. <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>

into which who&s;oever had the courage to enter, &amp; remain there the appointed time, did &s;ee and &s;uffer very &s;trange and terrible things, and to beget the greater re|putation to this fictitious Purgatory, the People were made to believe, that St. <HI>Patrick</HI> 400 years after Chri&s;t had obtained the &s;ame by his Prayers, to convince unbe|lievers of the immortality of the Soul, and the Tor|ments the wicked &s;uffer after this life; though it is cer|tain nothing of this was known till long after the death of this Holy Per&s;on, but about the latter end of K. <HI>James</HI> the truth of the matter was di&s;covered by the E. of <HI>Cork</HI> and the L. <HI>Chancellor,</HI> who de&s;irous to know the truth, &s;ent &s;ome Per&s;ons of Quality to inquire exactly into it; who found that this miraculous Cave de&s;cending down to the bottom of Hell, was no other but a little Cell digged out of the Rocky ground, without any Winnows or holes, &s;o as the door being &s;hut, it was utterly dark, being of &s;o little depth that a tall man could not &s;tand upright in it; and of no greater capacity than to hold 6 or 7 Per&s;ons. Now when any de&s;ired to go this Pilgri|mage, he was kept fa&s;ting &amp; watching by the Fryers, and told wonderful &s;tories, &s;o that being throughly affrigh|ted, and then put in, he came out in a few hours all a|mazed, and told &s;trange &s;tories of his going underground, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> To prevent this delu&s;ion for the future, the Lords, Ju&s;tices cau&s;ed the Fryars to depart, and laid the hole open, and expo&s;ed to the Air.</P>
