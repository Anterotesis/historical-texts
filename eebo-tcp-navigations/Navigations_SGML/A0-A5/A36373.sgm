<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>HAving lately had Oc|ca&s;ion to &s;ojourn almo&s;t Two Years in a</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Ant|werp.</NOTE> <HI>City of the</HI> Roman Com|munion: <HI>And that &s;uch an one as follows and ob&s;erves all the Methods and Practices of Super|&s;tition and Idolatry u&s;ed in that Church, perhaps in as good ear|ne&s;t, and with as much Exactne&s;s as any other whatever; I had there|by Opportunity to ob&s;erve &s;everal things of that Nature in common &V;&s;e there, which are not now com&cross;monly known to us in</HI> England.
<PB N="ii" REF="9"> <HI>This may well be, I think, becau&s;e 'tis &s;ome time &s;ince the Goodne&s;s of the Divine Providence to us, has happily deliver'd our Church from the Corruptions of</HI> Popery: <HI>Be|&s;ides this, the Church of</HI> Rome, <HI>which hates to be Reform'd, has &s;ince that time carried its Corrup|tions and Di&s;orders yet further, and to more enormous Degrees: to fulfil the Character of</HI> Evil Men, and Seducers, <HI>who</HI> grow wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">e and wor&s;e. <HI>I &s;aw too among them a Multitude of things that are a plain and perfect Contradiction to tho&s;e Plau&s;ible Expo&s;itions, and Re|pre&s;entations of the Doctrines and Practices of the Church of</HI> Rome, <HI>which have of late been made u&s;e of with but too much Succe&s;s in ma|ny Places. This Artifice indeed has been lately very learnedly and &s;trong|ly oppos'd among us, and the Cheat of it abundantly di&s;cover'd. But</HI>
<PB N="iii" REF="9"> <HI>after all, tho&s;e who go abroad in|to Places of the</HI> Roman Com|munion, <HI>and who &s;et them&s;elves to ob&s;erve what they may, and to examine what they ob&s;erve, cannot chu&s;e but think there may be Ma|terials collected, which may yet be u&s;ed to a further Effect again&s;t this De&s;ire; and I wi&s;h there were no need to do this. I had therefore a De&s;ign to have commu|nicated to the Publick what I had ob&s;erv'd, upon my coming home from that Place, but could hardly have per&s;waded my &s;elf to do it, becau&s;e the Ob&s;ervations I had made there, were confin'd to one City only. I was therefore glad when I found my &s;elf en|gag'd to go abroad again, hoping that an Opportunity might offer it &s;elf to go further, and to im|prove, or confirm them at lea&s;t,</HI>
<PB N="iv" REF="10"> <HI>by what I might &s;ee el&s;ewhere. Things &s;ucceeded in &s;ome Mea&s;ure according to my Wi&s;h; I found I could be &s;par'd from the Fami|ly I was in, and ea&s;ily obtain'd leave to be ab&s;ent for a little while; I re&s;olv'd to improve my time as well as I could, and di|rected my Cour&s;e to &s;uch Places within a little Compa&s;s, as I thought fitte&s;t to afford me the Matter of &s;uch Ob&s;ervations as I &s;ought for. Thus I came to be fur|ni&s;h'd with the Materials which are here put together.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I now re&s;olve to publi&s;h them for &s;everal Rea&s;ons, and hope they may be &s;erviceable to &s;everal important Purpo&s;es.</HI></P>
<P><HI>We have indeed (e&s;pecially the &V;nlearned Part of the Nation)</HI>
<PB N="v" REF="10"> <HI>forgotten what the</HI> Popi&s;h Reli|gion <HI>is in Truth: And there is an Ignorance of this among us, which gives us a great deal of Di&s;turbance, and which does a great deal of Harm. For hereby &s;ome things among us are cried out again&s;t with a mighty Ardour and Fiercene&s;s as</HI> Popi&s;h, <HI>which are truely Innocent, and &V;&s;eful, and which are deriv'd from the mo&s;t pious and pure&s;t Times of Primitive Chri&s;tianity. And on the other &s;ide, &s;ome things both in Doctrine and Practice, are fondly hugg'd and &s;tickled for, by the &s;ame People who make that unrea&s;onable Out cry, which were brought in with, and do truely belong to the Cor|ruptions of the</HI> Roman <HI>Church. The&s;e People want to have their Notions rectify'd, and their</HI> Idea <HI>of</HI> Popery <HI>corrected, and made</HI>
<PB N="vi" REF="11"> <HI>more accurate and ju&s;t, by a di|&s;tinct Repre&s;entation of the Par|ticulars, which will give the true Character of it. There are very unhappy Con&s;equences and Effects of this Mi&s;take. Some of the Reform'd Churches abroad, who do not know di&s;tinctly the State of ours, are prejudiced again&s;t us by the Writings and Reports of the&s;e fooli&s;h People, as having a World of the</HI> Popi&s;h Super&s;ti|tion <HI>and</HI> Corruption <HI>&s;till a|mong us, and as being very te|nacious and fond of it: And they cannot think us fit for their Cor|re&s;pondence in order to our mu|tual Defence, upon that &s;core. Be&s;ides, the Influence which our Church and Nation might have abroad towards the Defence, and perhaps the propagating and promoting of the Reformation, is</HI>
<PB N="vii" REF="11"> <HI>hereby much abated at lea&s;t, if I may not &s;ay 'tis wholly lo&s;t; while &s;o many among us apply all their Concern and Endeavour in Ca|balling again&s;t, and Seeking to undermine and throw down an</HI> Imaginary Popery <HI>in the Church of</HI> England. <HI>That Influence might be very con&s;iderable, if there were a Concurrence of all Par|ties towards it, by the Help of our Exten&s;ive Trade, and with the Advantage in re&s;pect of Learning, which our &V;niver&s;ities and Clergy have over the great|e&s;t Part of (if I may not &s;ay all) the Church of</HI> Rome: <HI>But e&s;pecially under the Conduct and Management of an Excellent Prince, who has &s;o wi&s;e, and ju&s;t, and &s;o great a Zeal for the Honour and Intere&s;t of the Reformation in General, as his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty</HI>
<PB N="viii" REF="12"> <HI>has, and who has the greate&s;t Renown and Glory, and the mo&s;t extended Intere&s;t of any Monarch in the World; whom God grant long to Reign over us, and to have yet more Influence, by his Great Wi&s;dom, and Glorious Ver|tues, among us. It is an Amaze|ment, that amid&s;t all our Jea|lou&s;ies, e&s;pecially &s;ince they have mo&s;t abounded, we &s;hould never to any Purpo&s;e fall upon this, to &s;u&s;pect that the</HI> Je&s;uits <HI>and</HI> Romi&s;h Emi&s;&s;aries <HI>do in Di&s;|gui&s;e promote our Divi&s;ions on purpo&s;e to hinder any &s;uch &V;nani|mous Concurrence among&s;t us a|gain&s;t them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>We have indeed a Zeal again&s;t</HI> Popery <HI>among&s;t us; but as much of it is lo&s;t by a Mi&s;take in the Object, &s;o, I doubt, a great deal</HI>
<PB N="ix" REF="12"> <HI>of the re&s;t in the Wi&s;e Men of the World, is of le&s;s Effect and Ex|tent than it might and ought to be, for want of a due and right Principle. I wi&s;h it be not their only Concern to &s;ecure them&s;elves from the Lo&s;&s;es they might &s;u&s;tain in their ju&s;t Liberties, and their Properties, if it were impo&s;ed upon them at home; and that they be not too regardle&s;s what becomes of the Reformation in o|ther Parts of the World. It &s;eems indeed ea&s;ie to &s;ee (but even Wi&s;e Men &s;ometimes look too intently upon one thing) that while the</HI> Prote&s;tant Religion <HI>is de&s;troy'd by degrees abroad, and one Part of the Reformation after another is trodden down, the common Intere&s;t of it mu&s;t be weaker and weaker, and it mu&s;t be le&s;s able to &s;ub&s;i&s;t with us at home.</HI>
<PB N="x" REF="13"> <HI>It is the great Concern of all &s;orts of Per&s;ons, on the other &s;ide, to promote and propagate their own Religion, and to extirpate ours. Among them, 'tis not only the vil|lanous Treacheries and Plots of</HI> Je&s;uits <HI>that are employ'd in the Work; 'tis not the Wheedles of the other Mi&s;&s;ionary</HI> Monks <HI>a|lone; or the Bu&s;ine&s;s of tho&s;e who &s;eem to make the greate&s;t Gain of propagating their Religi|on, but even Princes have ap|plyed their utmo&s;t Power, and have hazarded or lo&s;t, and almo&s;t ruin'd their Dominions in their Zeal to &s;erve their Cau&s;e: And the greate&s;t State&s;men have found time to con&s;ider, and &s;erve this, amid&s;t their mo&s;t Important Af|fairs. They concern them&s;elves to extirpate the</HI> Prote&s;tant Religion <HI>not only out of the Countries which</HI>
<PB N="xi" REF="13"> <HI>they govern, but even out of the World. And what formidable Succe&s;&s;es have they had again&s;t us with their continued Applica|tions and Endeavours! After o|ther mighty Havocks made upon the Reformation, we have &s;een them trample upon it in our Time in</HI> Hungary <HI>and</HI> France; <HI>and at this pre&s;ent they are making an End with the &s;mall Remainders of it in the</HI> Palatinate; <HI>and that by Virtue of Advantages gain'd again&s;t it by their extraordinary Vigilance and Application to the matter in a late Treaty. They are zealous and indu&s;trious while We are indifferent. It has been &s;een, that the Wi&s;e Men on our &s;ide have been too &s;harp for tho&s;e of the other, in Matters of Trade, while the others have been too hard for them in the Matter of the Intere&s;t</HI>
<PB N="xii" REF="14"> <HI>of the Reformation; which &s;peaks plainly the Difference of Applica|tion and Concern to the Matter. One would &s;u&s;pect from the&s;e things, that the Trick of Repre|&s;enting and Expounding the Do|ctrines and Practices of the Church of</HI> Rome, <HI>had cheated our Poli|ticians of the true Notions of</HI> Po|pery, <HI>and had made them believe the Differences between that Church and tho&s;e who are Reformed, to be but &s;mall and incon&s;iderable; and this had betrayed them into Indif|ferency, and Neglect to watch and oppo&s;e the De&s;igns of</HI> Rome <HI>again&s;t us: And that it were nece&s;&s;ary to &s;how even to them, or at lea&s;t to call to their Remembrance, how Ab&s;urd and &V;nrea&s;onable, how Im|pious and Wicked many of the Doctrines and Practices of that Church are; to be &s;ure if the Spi|rit
<PB N="xiii" REF="14"> of Chri&s;tian Religion did eve|ry where prevail among us: As it is a Di&s;po&s;ition po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, and govern'd by the Reverence and Love of God, and the Love of our Neighbour, none could be un|concern'd that Chri&s;tian Religion &s;hould be &s;o abus'd, and Almigh|ty God &s;o much injur'd in his due Reverence and Honour, and the Souls of Men &s;o endanger'd with damnable Errours, as the&s;e things are done by the Corruptions grown now inveterate in that Church. And it mu&s;t needs be wi&s;h'd, that a more Active and Powerful Princi|ple than Men are now commonly guided by, could be found or a|wakned, to &s;et them upon a due and ju&s;t Care and Endeavour for the common Defence and Support of the Reformation.</HI></P>
<PB N="xiv" REF="15">
<P><HI>I propo&s;e, further, to be &s;ervice|able in the Publi&s;hing of this Ac|count, to tho&s;e of our young Gen|try who go to travel in Countries of the</HI> Roman Communion, <HI>and who often need &s;uch Intimations as they have here, what they &s;hould ob&s;erve, and &s;uch A&s;&s;i&s;tance to un|der&s;tand what they may ob&s;erve.

The neare&s;t part of the City is about half a Mile from the Water, but there is a great Ca|nal which carries good big Ve&s;&s;els up into the Town.

We &s;aw a Church and &s;omewhat of a Village upon it as we pa&s;&s;ed by, and &s;topt a little way below it within &s;ight of it. We were in a new Ship that was upon her fir&s;t Voyage, having never been abroad before, and yet &s;he knew her way al|mo&s;t as well as the Skipper. For when we had here an Occa&s;ion to upbraid him for his Ignorance, he confe&s;&s;ed he had been this Voy|age &s;ome Years ago in his younger time, but had now almo&s;t forgot his way. And this ap|pear'd true, for he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to go over a Flat, whereas there was a Channel round it, and the Compa&s;s was not very large. We &s;aw a Ship bigger than ours, and deep loaden, &s;ail half round us in that Channel, while we were labouring, and likely to have been fa&s;t upon the Flat, tho' the Tide was then almo&s;t at the highe&s;t, and we had but few people on Board, and no heavy Lading at all. After the Labour of two hours of more to proceed about the length of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mile, and with the help of &s;everal &s;trong Hands of Pa&s;&s;engers ad|ded to tho&s;e of the Skipper and his Mate, we got into the right Channel.

<P>The Inhabitants apply them&s;elves to the Sea, and trade to all Parts; a multitude of them employ them&s;elves in Fi&s;hing, and furni&s;h their Neighbours with Fi&s;h: they &s;tock the plenti|ful Fi&s;h-Market at <HI>Antwerp.</HI> Some think, and the <HI>Daeni&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tories pretend to it, that the I&s;lands of this Province were fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s'd and inhabited by a People out of <HI>Denmark;</HI> where indeed there is an I&s;land call'd <HI>Zeeland,</HI> on which &s;tands <HI>Copenhagen,</HI> and 'tis &s;uppo&s;ed the People came from thence, and call'd this new Countrey by the Name of that from whence
<PB N="6" REF="20"> they came. But if this were not &s;o, this Name might fitly be given to this Province for the Situation of the&s;e I&s;lands. They have been wont to reckon, that there were Eight wall'd Cities upon the&s;e I&s;lands; one of the&s;e call'd <HI>Romers-wael,</HI> is now no more; the chief of all is <HI>Middleburg,</HI> which &s;tands upon the I&s;land <HI>Walcheren,</HI> a City rich, populous, and flouri&s;h|ing in Trade to all parts. There were al&s;o reckon'd formerly upon the&s;e I&s;lands 102 Villages, but many of the&s;e are gone to wrack by the Sea. They who go about to de&s;cribe the Province of <HI>Zealand,</HI> commonly &s;ay, they can hardly pretend to give the pre&s;ent State of it, becau&s;e, perhaps, while they write, the Sea may be making &s;ome con&s;iderable Alterations in it: This is a thing which frequently happens; &s;ometimes the Sea joyns two little I&s;lands to|gether by throwing up a Bank of Sand between them; &s;ometimes it cuts off one part of an I|&s;land from the re&s;t, by throwing a Channel of Water in between them. The People are for|ced to defend the Countrey with high Dykes or Banks of Earth rais'd up; and the&s;e Banks them&s;elves need a Defence to keep the Water from wa&s;hing them away; for they being but a loo&s;e Mold, this very ea&s;ily comes to pa&s;s, if the Water can come at them. To prevent which, they make u&s;e of a Device which will &s;eem &s;trange to mo&s;t People in <HI>England,</HI> but which is very frequent here, and on the Banks of many of the great running Waters in <HI>Hol|land:</HI> They take the time of Low-water and lay and fa&s;ten upon the Shoar a Mattre&s;s of Straw, which is two or three Inches thick, which reaches from the lowe&s;t Ebb of Low-Water,
<PB N="7" REF="20"> to the highe&s;t Ri&s;e of Spring-Tides, and allows &s;omething more for the &s;welling of the Water by a &s;trong <HI>We&s;t</HI> or <HI>North we&s;t</HI> Wind, which u&s;ually rai&s;es the Water con&s;iderably here.</P>
<P>Out of the <HI>Vo&s;&s;emaer</HI> where we lay the &s;e|cond Night, we &s;ail'd the next Morning, being the 15th of <HI>May,</HI> into the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> Channel of the <HI>Schelde,</HI> where we had the Land of <HI>Bra|bant</HI> &s;till on our left &s;ide, and the I&s;land of <HI>South-Bevelandt</HI> on our Right.

On the Right &s;ide of it is a large Tract. of <HI>South-Bevelandt,</HI> which has been long under Water. It is &s;o wide, and the Land beyond it lies &s;o low, that one can hardly &s;ee any Land on that &s;ide. This Tract contain'd 15 or 16 Villa|ges, of which nothing now is left; but the Names of them &s;till remain in the Maps in the Places where they &s;tood. On this drowned part of this I&s;land &s;tood the City of <HI>Romers|wael</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Romers|wael.</NOTE> mention'd before, oppo&s;ite to <HI>Bergen-op-Zoom</HI> in <HI>Brabant,</HI> and not above a League di|&s;tant from it.

In this City (to which it belong'd as a Privilege) the States of <HI>Zee|land</HI> met to recognize and &s;ubmit to a new Count of <HI>Zeeland</HI> in the Year 1549.

<P>In this Pa&s;&s;age we &s;ail'd by <HI>Bergen-op-Zoom,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Bergen-op-Zoom.</NOTE> but at a good Di&s;tance from it, yet we have &s;ome Pro&s;pect of the Town and Fortifications, becau&s;e it &s;tands upon a Ground which ri&s;es a little.

<P>This is a little Place very &s;trongly fortify'd <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lillo.</NOTE> on the left &s;ide of the <HI>Schelde,</HI> as one &s;ails up it, upon the Countrey of <HI>Brabant:</HI> it belongs to the States General of the United Provinces, tho' it be within three Leagues of <HI>Antwerp:</HI> it is always po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by a good Garri&s;on of Soul|diers: it was formerly the Seat of a Barony, and belong'd to a Family that were nam'd <HI>Van-dale.</HI> The People of <HI>Antwerp</HI> fortify'd this Place well &s;ometime before the Year 1534. and put in Garri&s;on here &s;ome of their cho&s;en and mo&s;t tru&s;ty Citizens to keep it for the Se|curity of their Trade and Navigation. In the
<PB N="9" REF="21"> time of the Rebellion of the&s;e Countries a|gain&s;t the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Government, this Fort was be&s;ieg'd by the Duke of <HI>Parma,</HI> who lay before it for &s;ome time, lo&s;t 2000 of his Men, &s;aw there was no hope of making him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of it, and therefore quitted the Siege. After this, &s;ome time, it became united to the Con|federate States, and they took, and have kept Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it ever &s;ince; in which time 'tis grown from a Fort to a little Town. Here we were forc'd to &s;top to be &s;earch'd, and to pay a Toll which the <HI>Dutch</HI> here take of all Ships that pa&s;s by. Our Skipper was al&s;o to have produced a Pa&s;sport, but he had neglected to take one at <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> and &s;o his Ship was &s;topt for that; he had no other way now to be fur|ni&s;h'd with one, but by &s;ending to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Commi&s;&s;ary re&s;iding at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> who had Power to grant him one, but he could not tell whether he would do it or not. When we found him under this Confinement and Un|certainty, we left him, and went on board a|nother <HI>Dutch</HI> Ve&s;&s;el belonging to <HI>Harlem,</HI> which was loaden with <HI>Rye,</HI> and was bound for <HI>Bru&s;|&s;els;</HI> who&s;e Skipper undertook to carry us to <HI>Antwerp</HI> for Four Stivers each Per&s;on. We &s;at in the Skipper's Cabbin, which was Bed-cham|ber, Kitchin and Parlour, and almo&s;t fill'd with Four Per&s;ons. Here &s;at the Skipper's Wife, who kept it very neat and clean; &s;he &s;hew'd her &s;elf a hearty Friend to our good King, and &s;poke with a great deal of Veneration and E|&s;teem of our late incomparable Queen, and &s;o render'd her Conver&s;ation very agreeable to us. The Skipper crowded him&s;elf among us for a little while to eat his Breakfa&s;t, for here
<PB N="10" REF="22"> was the Store of Provi&s;ions too, and he &s;ed heartily upon the Remainders of a Hough of Bacon, generou&s;ly offering us to partake with him. We &s;ail'd with a good Wind, but now had a &s;trong Tide again&s;t us. We came up to Fort St. <HI>Mary,</HI> which is, I think, about two Hours above <HI>Lillo,</HI> ju&s;t after Twelve a Clock. This is a Fort which belongs to' the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and &s;tands on the right &s;ide of the <HI>Schelde</HI> upon the Countrey of <HI>Flanders:</HI> Here al&s;o we mu&s;t &s;top to be &s;earch'd, and to pay a Toll. But the Gates of the Fort were &s;hut, according to cu|&s;tom, and would continue &s;o a whole Hour; &s;o it was one a Clock before the Officer could come out to us: We were &s;oon di&s;mi&s;s'd when he came, and &s;ail'd on to <HI>Antwerp,</HI> where we arriv'd in good time in the Afternoon.</P>

<P>THE fir&s;t Beginnings of this City, as well <NOTE PLACE="marg">Original.</NOTE> as of many others in the&s;e Parts, are ob|&s;cure, which is an Evidence that they are very ancient, and had their Beginning while the People were yet &s;o barbarous and unlearn|ed as not to mind, or not to be able to tran&s;|mit their Hi&s;tory to Po&s;terity. There is how|ever a Tradition &s;till kept up in this City by &s;everal things which relates to &s;ome of the fir&s;t times of it, which I &s;hall take notice of here. They &s;ay, that about the times of <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> there was here a &s;trong Ca&s;tle or Fort which was held by a mighty Giant, to whom &s;ome give the Name of <HI>Druon,</HI> &s;ome of <HI>Antigonus;</HI> he was Governour of the People hereabout, and a barbarous Tyrant. He was wont to re|quire
<PB N="11" REF="22"> of all Ships which pa&s;s'd upon the River by this Place, the one half of the Goods which they carry'd, or the Worth of it; and if he found that any endeavour'd to defraud him of any Part of this, which he reckon'd his Due, their Puni&s;hment was, That he would cut off one of their Hands, and throw it into the Ri|ver. From this Story they derive the Rea&s;on of the City's Name, making <HI>Antwerp</HI> out of the&s;e two Words, <HI>Handt</HI> and <HI>Werpen,</HI> which &s;ignifie <HI>to throw the Hand:</HI> And indeed the true <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;pelling of the Name is <HI>Handtwerpen;</HI> We call it <HI>Antwerp,</HI> and the French, <HI>Anvers;</HI> the Latine Name is <HI>Antwerpia.</HI> This Story is commemorated, as I &s;aid, in this City &s;e|veral ways. As we enter the City from the River, we &s;ee over the Gate in Stone-work, a large Image of a Man of a fierce Look, with a great drawn Sword in his Right-hand, and holding in his Left another Hand, as cut off from &s;ome Per&s;on. They put al&s;o in the Arms of this City two Hands, as cut off, toge|ther with a Ca&s;tle. They have al&s;o a Cu&s;tom of carrying, in one of their &s;olemn Proce&s;&s;ions once a Year, a certain great Statue of a Man, which is de&s;ign'd to repre&s;ent this Giant, which is follow'd by &s;ome People who are &s;o dre&s;t, as that they &s;eem to have each of them a Hand cut off. This Ceremony we were told, was to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e perform'd the next Week following that in which we were there, which would be <HI>Whit|&s;on-Week,</HI> according to the New-Stile. It was al&s;o &s;aid it would be more than ordinarily pom|pous and fine, becau&s;e it had been omitted for &s;ome Years during the late War; but our time would not permit us to &s;tay to &s;ee it.</P>

<P>This City is &s;eated in a large Plain on the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Situation.</NOTE> Right &s;ide of the <HI>Schelde,</HI> as it runs towards the Sea, which is here, and &s;omewhat upwards, as well as down to <HI>Zeeland,</HI> the Boundary be|tween <HI>Brabant</HI> and <HI>Flanders. Antwerp</HI> is di|&s;tant from the Sea, if one follows the River, about 17 Leagues; but if one goes the &s;hort|e&s;t way by Land, it is but 13. The River is capable of bringing great Ships loaden up to the Wharf of the City. The Tide ri&s;es here perpendicular 12 Feet; the common Depth of the River by the City is about 50 Feet. At a place between <HI>Antwerp</HI> and <HI>Lillo,</HI> where, I think, it &s;eems no broader than here, it is reckon'd to be 2400 Feet in breadth, and at Low-water it is there 60 Feet in depth. There it was that the Duke of <HI>Parma</HI> in the time of the Civil Wars, built his Bridge when he came to be&s;iege <HI>Antwerp.</HI> There is now no Bridge any where hereabout over the River, but Boats and a Ferry-pa&s;s from this City to a Village on the other &s;ide call'd the <HI>Head of Flanders. Ant|werp</HI> was formerly the Head of one of the Four Quarters of <HI>Brabant,</HI> and is &s;o &s;till for &s;o much as remains of that part under the King of <HI>Spain.</HI> It had under its Juri&s;diction the Cities of <HI>Bergen op-Zoom, Breda, Lier, Herentals,</HI> and <HI>Steenberg;</HI> the two former of which, and I believe the la&s;t are under the Dominion of the States of the United Provinces at pre&s;ent; it &s;till retains how|ever the Title of a Marqui&s;ate of the holy Em|pire. There are &s;till remaining &s;ome Appearan|ces of the fir&s;t Wall which was the compa&s;s of the Ca&s;tle or the Fort foremention'd; which takes in the Church of St. <HI>Walburg</HI> commonly call'd the <HI>Burg</HI>-Church; which was in former
<PB N="13" REF="23"> times, they &s;ay, a Heathen Temple. This compa&s;s is di&s;tinctly mark'd in the Map of this City. In the Year 1201. there was an En|largement of the City begun, and a Wall of a bigger Compa&s;s made. Again another Enlarge|ment it had, which was begun in the Year 1314. The la&s;t of all, and that which it has at pre&s;ent, was begun in the Year 1543. at which time the City flouri&s;h'd mightily in Trade, and was in hopes of growing yet greater. A Remem|brance of which one &s;ees carved in the Stone|work on the out-&s;ide of one of the Gates, I think it is the <HI>George's-Gate,</HI> where are the&s;e Words, <HI>Plus ultra,</HI> relating to that matter. And there is a large Compa&s;s mark'd out among the Gardens adjoyning to the City, which was intended for the next Addition to it.</P>
<P>The Encrea&s;es of this City were due to the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Pro&s;perity.</NOTE> great Privileges granted it by the Dukes of <HI>Brabant,</HI> which drew and encouraged a migh|ty Trade here, to and from all parts of the World. Several Fairs in a Year were furni&s;h'd with all manner of Goods that the neighbour|ing parts of the World could vend. But the greate&s;t Improvement of its Trade and Gran|dure, was the making it for a while the common Mart of the Commodities of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> for <HI>Germany</HI> and the <HI>Northern</HI> parts of <HI>Europe.</HI> This Trade began about the Year 1503, and 1504. at which time the <HI>Portugueze</HI> having found out the Navigation round <HI>Africa</HI> to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> brought the Riches of tho&s;e Countries by Sea into <HI>Portugal,</HI> and from thence they were convey'd to this City for the Service of the&s;e parts of the World. Several Princes had Stock in Trade here, manag'd by Factors appointed by them;
<PB N="14" REF="24"> as the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> and Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> who&s;e Factor was Sir <HI>Thomas Gre&s;ham:</HI> He, when he return'd home, built the <HI>Royal Exchange</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> after the Model of the Bur&s;e at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> the Queen her &s;elf laying the fir&s;t Stone, and honouring the Build|ing with that Name. In the Year 1564. it was ob&s;erv'd, that at <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> there came to the Sacrament at the &s;everal Churches 80600 Per|&s;ons. In the Year 1561. 'tis &s;aid, the Inhabi|tants were number'd, and made up between Strangers and Citizens above 200000. It was then u&s;ual to have 25000 Ships lying about this City at a time, and 500 in a day to come and go. Waggons loaden with Goods brought from <HI>Germany, Lorrain</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> 2000 in a Week came to this City. And of the Boors and Countrey People there were commonly rec|kon'd 10000 Carts that came laden every Week with what they could bring to the Markets. Twice a day at certain hours there was wont to be a Concour&s;e of about 5000 People to the Bur&s;e or Exchange</P>
<P>The&s;e things mu&s;t needs &s;eem very &s;trange to tho&s;e who are acquainted with the pre&s;ent So|litude and Silence of this noble City. In the time of the late War, when there were conti|nually many Strangers here that had bu&s;ine&s;s relating to the Armies, it &s;eem'd then but very thin of People, in Proportion to its Room and Grandeur, and to have but very little bu&s;ine&s;s; but when we came there now, it was an A|mazement to &s;ee how much more &s;olitary it ap|pear'd. It looks now, methinks, much like one great Cloi&s;ter, where one can neither hear nor &s;ee any body, almo&s;t, but at certain Hours at
<PB N="15" REF="24"> the Chappel: Here one &s;ees no Companies of People, but at the Church, at proper Sea&s;ons. It is really a matter of Wonder, that a place &s;o commodious for Habitation and Trade, &s;hould be &s;o de&s;erted as it is.</P>
<P>It is &s;ituated upon a firm, dry Soil, and &s;tands <NOTE PLACE="marg">Commodi|ou&s;ne&s;s.</NOTE> very airy, and well for the Health of the In|habitants. The Countrey about it is fit for Gardens and Hou&s;es of Plea&s;ure, where there have been many &s;uch belonging to rich Citi|zens, and there are &s;ome &s;till remaining. The Countrey affords all things in plenty, that the Earth can yield in our Climate for the Service of Human Life. The noble River brings them great Plenty and Variety of Fi&s;h. We walk'd on a <HI>Thur&s;day</HI>-Morning in the Fi&s;h market, which is worth a Strangers while to do; we &s;aw there a great number of large Cod-fi&s;h fre&s;h, &s;ome Turbouts &s;o big, as it would hardly be believ'd by every body, if we &s;hould repre&s;ent it. The Fi&s;hmongers were cutting out &s;ome of them to &s;ell in pieces; the Jowl of one, if we may &s;o &s;peak, which was cut off but a little be|low the Gills, was big enough to fill a good large di&s;h. There lay &s;everal large Salmons upon the Stalls; this Fi&s;h they have in plenty here, and rea&s;onably cheap, and very good. There was not a whole Sturgeon then in the Market, but &s;uch are often brought thither. I have been told by tho&s;e that have &s;een it, of a Sturgeon brought into this Market upon a large Plank, that has been Load enough for half a dozen Men to bring it conveniently. We &s;aw three large pieces of one lie there, which had been cut up the day before; they were cut through the Body of the Fi&s;h, and &s;eem'd
<PB N="16" REF="25"> bigger than the bigge&s;t Fillet of Veal that I e|ver &s;aw in <HI>London;</HI> They lay &s;omewhat in that &s;hape. There was a great Quantity of large Plaice, as big as any I ever &s;aw at <HI>Tunbridge</HI> or el&s;ewhere, and great plenty of the le&s;&s;er &s;orts of Fi&s;hes alive in Water. This River affords Anchovies, which they &s;ometime dre&s;s, and eat fre&s;h; they have a very rich high ta&s;te, but it is accounted feveri&s;h Food. The Fi&s;h which they chiefly admire, is a large Fi&s;h about the bigne&s;s of a Salmon, and of the &s;ame &s;hape, but the fle&s;h of it is white; this comes often to Mar|ket, and is &s;old at the deare&s;t Rates; they call it here an <HI>Ellebut:</HI> 'tis very firm, and of a rich, plea&s;ant ta&s;te. The City is furni&s;h'd with &s;mall Wines from <HI>France,</HI> which come down the <HI>Scheld,</HI> and by Sea it can have any of the richer, more generous &s;orts of other Countries. They have plenty of Wood for Fuel, and at a rea&s;onable Rate, which the Countrey affords them by the help of the River. No Place in <HI>Europe</HI> can be better &s;tor'd with all things which Gardens can yield for the Service of a Family than this. They have in the Sea&s;ons excellent good Fle&s;h-Meats of all &s;orts. The People are &s;ome of the mo&s;t generous and &s;incere in their Dealings that one can ea&s;ily meet with, yet is this place &s;o for&s;aken. There are on the Ramparts &s;e|veral large Ba&s;tions planted with rows of tall Lime-trees, which give a whol&s;ome and plea|&s;ant Shade. All the re&s;t of the Ramparts are &s;o planted round the City, and in &s;ome parts they are &s;o broad, that they have two broad Walks run parallel upon them, and both of them have on each &s;ide a Row of tall Trees, which, by mingling their Boughs at the top, make a very
<PB N="17" REF="25"> plea&s;ant Arbour which is &s;trait, and of a good length. The&s;e Ramparts are rais'd &s;o high, that we have from them a good large Pro&s;pect over the adjoyning Countrey; where one &s;ees a very plea&s;ant mixture of Corn-fields, Villages, Rows of Trees, Gardens, Meadows and Woods, which lie in the Countrey about. Indeed all the Countrey about looks like a Garden; the Roads and wa&s;te Places are adorn'd with Rows of Trees; and the near Husbandman dre&s;&s;es up his Corn-field ju&s;t as if it were a Garden. They make the Ridges very high and broad, and form the Furrows at la&s;t, when 'tis plow'd and &s;own, with a Spade: &s;o that the Ridges look like the Beds of a Garden.</P>
<P>The Compa&s;s of this City is reckon'd to be <NOTE PLACE="marg">Extent.</NOTE> about 4700 Paces, and if the Plain which leads to the Cittadel, be taken in with that al&s;o, the whole Compa&s;s amounts to about 6000 Paces. The <HI>Area</HI> of the whole City is about half of a Circle, the Diameter of which is the River, and the Wall the Circumference. The large&s;t Reach of it from &s;ide to &s;ide, is along the River, which is reckon'd to be, beginning at the <HI>Slyck-Port</HI> on the <HI>North-&s;ide,</HI> and ending at the Bridge which goes into the Cittadel on the <HI>South,</HI> 1800 Paces. It is reckon'd to have in it 220 Streets great and &s;mall, &s;ome of them are very long, and &s;traight and broad: the <HI>Mere</HI> is the broade&s;t, and is a very &s;tately Street. In the broade&s;t part of it &s;tands upon a large Pede&s;tal a great Crucifix, gilded all o|ver, to which one &s;hall often &s;ee Devotions paid by tho&s;e who pa&s;s by. On the left &s;ide <NOTE PLACE="marg">Bur&s;e.</NOTE> of this is one of the Pa&s;&s;ages on to the Bur&s;e or Exchange, which is near. There are Four
<PB N="18" REF="26"> &s;hort Pa&s;&s;ages into it from other Streets which enter about the middle of the four &s;ides of it; the <HI>Area</HI> is almo&s;t &s;quare, and &s;eems as big as ours at <HI>London,</HI> if not bigger. It has a Piazza round it, which is on the out-&s;ide &s;upported with Marble Pillars: the&s;e were curiou&s;ly wrought, but the Beauty of them is now much decay'd by Time and Weather. The chief Trade of this City now &s;eems to be in Lace, the making of which employs &s;ome thou&s;ands of People. In the time of its Pro&s;perity was built at the Charge of the City their Magnifi|cent <HI>Stadt-Hou&s;e,</HI> which has a large and &s;tately <NOTE PLACE="marg">Town-hou&s;e.</NOTE> Front, adorn'd with &s;everal Marble Pillars and Statues, among which, that of the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> is Eminent and Con&s;picuous. This Building &s;hews it &s;elf upon a very &s;pacious open place, which they call <HI>The great Market,</HI> near the Cathedral-Church. There are &s;everal Canals which enter the City out of the River, and ri&s;e and fall with the Tides; the large&s;t of the&s;e is towards the <HI>North</HI>-&s;ide of the City, which is big enough to entertain a Hundred good Merchants Ships. Near this &s;tands a great Building call'd, <HI>The Oo&s;terling</HI> or <HI>Ea&s;terling-Hou&s;e;</HI> it &s;tands about a large Court; round about it on the out-&s;ides are &s;everal great Doors for the Entrances of Warehou&s;es: within the Court below are &s;ome Rooms for Habitation; and above at the fir&s;t Story there is an open Gallery which goes round the Court, and lets in to the &s;everal large Lodging Rooms. This Hou&s;e was built by Merchants of <HI>Denmark,</HI> and the Han&s;e-Towns of <HI>Germany,</HI> who&s;e Fa|ctors dwelt here together, and kept here their Stores of Goods and Effects. This now begins
<PB N="19" REF="26"> to decay, tho' there is a Family in it to look after it, and the &s;ame Towns are &s;till at the Charge to &s;upport it, as if they were in hopes that a time might come to u&s;e it again as be|fore.</P>
<P>The occa&s;ion of the great Alteration in this <NOTE PLACE="marg">Decay.</NOTE> City is &s;aid to be this: In the beginning of the Reformation, when many People were di|&s;turb'd for falling in with it in <HI>Germany,</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> they fled many of them hither, thinking to live unob&s;erv'd in &s;uch a great heap and concour&s;e of People, or to be quiet and &s;afe by rea&s;on of the great Privileges which the City enjoy'd. But the&s;e People re|commended and &s;pread their Opinions here and in the neighbouring places. This was ob|&s;erv'd, and would not be endur'd by the Go|vernment, which was then under the Directi|on of a Prince very zealous for the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> Among other things done with a De|&s;ign to prevent the &s;preading of the Reforma|tion, <HI>Philip,</HI> King of <HI>Spain,</HI> their Sovereign, as Duke of <HI>Brabant,</HI> publi&s;h'd an Edict about the Year 1565. importing, That all Hereticks &s;hould be put to death without Remi&s;&s;ion; That the Emperor's Edicts, and the Council of <HI>Trent</HI> &s;hould be publi&s;h'd and ob&s;erv'd, and commanding that the utmo&s;t A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Civil Power &s;hould be given to the Inqui&s;tion. This, and other things which di&s;gu&s;ted the No|bility of the&s;e Provinces, were done by the Go|vernment, and all Orders of this &s;ort were ri|gorou&s;ly executed by the Duke <HI>D' Alva;</HI> which things put the whole Seventeen Provinces un|der the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Dominion, into a Commotion; it came to a bloody Civil War, and ended in
<PB N="20" REF="27"> the total Defection of the pre&s;ent United Pro|vinces from Subjection to <HI>Spain.</HI> In the times of the&s;e Troubles many Merchants went away with their Goods and Effects to places where they could be more &s;afe and quiet: many, to be undi&s;turb'd in their Religion, went to <HI>Am|&s;terdam,</HI> and to <HI>London,</HI> Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> being now come to the Throne, and &s;o the Fall of this City was a means of the Grandeur of tho&s;e two. It is &s;aid, That an Account was taken in tho&s;e times, and it was found, that at once, within the &s;pace of a few days, an hundred thou&s;and Men had for&s;aken this and other Tra|ding Cities of the&s;e Provinces, with all that they could carry away with them, to avoid the Rigours and Severities of the Government, and the greater Hazards and Dangers of Lo&s;&s;es and Mi&s;chief from the Confu&s;ion and Licen&s;e of the Civil Wars.</P>
<P>There is no publick Exerci&s;e or Profe&s;&s;ion of Religion permitted here, but what is conform'd and &s;ubject to the Practice and Authority of the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> The Church of this Dioce&s;e is govern'd by <HI>Johannes Ferdinandus de Berghem,</HI> who is the pre&s;ent Bi&s;hop of <HI>Antwerp,</HI> and has his dwelling there: He is a very grave and venerable Per&s;on, exemplary in his Con|ver&s;ation, and in great Reputation for his Cha|rity and Zeal. But in Conjunction with the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Mechlin,</HI> to whom he is Suffra|gan, and the Faction of the Je&s;uits, he is &s;evere again&s;t all tho&s;e who are call'd by the Name of <HI>Jan&s;eni&s;ts,</HI> and are &s;u&s;pected to favour the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">an&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ls.</NOTE> Opinions of <HI>Jan&s;enius,</HI> of whom we &s;hall give &s;ome Account when we come to <HI>Lou|vain.</HI></P>
<PB N="21" REF="27">
<P>The Inhabitants of this Town, however, under the Conduct of this their Bi&s;hop, are &s;uch as de&s;erve the Character of a very pious and good People. We can hardly &s;ee any where in the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> &s;o regular and &s;trict an Ob&s;ervance of all the Forms, Methods, and times of Devotion, common to that Church, as is very evident here: which makes a Man who is any thing &s;en&s;ible of the Cor|ruptions and Errors of that Church, heartily lament to &s;ee &s;o much Piety and Devotion &s;o ill directed and apply'd.</P>
<P>The Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> is reputed and honour'd <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Virgin</HI> Mary <HI>Pa|trone&s;s of</HI> Antwerp</NOTE> as the Patrone&s;s or Protectre&s;s of this City. In a fine Chapel dedicated to her in the great Church, and which &s;eems more frequented than any other in the Church, there &s;tands an Image of a Woman to repre&s;ent her; to the girdle of which is hung a &s;mall Gold Key, re|pre&s;enting the Key of the City Gates. But the bad Hu&s;wife has prov'd &s;o unfit to keep the City, that &s;he has often lo&s;t the Key of it. There was a Report &s;he had lo&s;t her Key in one Night in the Year 1696. but I &s;aw within a little while after that &s;he was honour'd with another for all that. Certainly this pre&s;enting her with a Key of their City has &s;ome further meaning than only to expect the Protection of Almighty God through her Interce&s;&s;ion; and looks very like, at lea&s;t, to the commit|ting them&s;elves to her immediate Protection. As one goes out at St <HI>George's-Gate,</HI> under the Pa&s;&s;age, there &s;tands an Image of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> with &s;ome <HI>Dutch</HI> Ver&s;es under it, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">h &s;ignifie as follows:
<Q><PB N="22" REF="28">All hone&s;t and &s;incere Catholicks, Honour ye <HI>Mary</HI> the Mother of our Lord: &s;how to her great Love; that ye may be pre|&s;erved both in going out, and coming in: From all Pain and &s;udden Death. He &s;hall never travel unfortunately, who calls upon her in the time of his nece&s;&s;ity.</Q></P>
<P>Here is no intimation in the lea&s;t of her In|terce&s;&s;ion, but the People are directed to call upon her for their Safety, and to honour her, that they may obtain it. In the great Church there hand up &s;everal printed Litanies of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> as they are call'd, which People are encourag'd to &s;ay over there upon their Knees before an Image of the Virgin, by the Grants of Indulgences to them that &s;hall do &s;o. In the&s;e Litanies 'tis u&s;ual to repeat fre|quently the&s;e Words, <HI>Have Mercy upon us,</HI> as addre&s;s'd to her. They &s;ay to her, <HI>From all Evil and Danger, and from all Sin, deliver us, O glorious Virgin.</HI> And, <HI>That it may plea&s;e thee to pro|tect, and pre&s;erve, and encrea&s;e the Congregations and A&s;&s;emblies, which by a particular Dvotion and Servitude are devoted to thee; we humbly be&s;eech thee to hear us. That it may plea&s;e thee to keep our Hearts and Minds in all Cha&s;tity, and Purity, and Piety, we humbly be&s;eech thee to hear us.</HI> The&s;e and many other like things, in the common and allow'd Practice of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> do plainly &s;ignifie, That they ask, and expect Help from the &s;aints them&s;elves. Tho' 'tis pretended by the Council of <HI>Trent,</HI> and Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Meaux,</HI> that they ask of God only, for their &s;akes, and hope to obtain of God by their Interce&s;&s;ion what they de&s;ire. And the <HI>Mechlin</HI> Catechi&s;m as well as their common Practice does palpa|bly
<PB N="23" REF="28"> contradict this Pretence. The 7th. Que|&s;tion of the 18th. Le&s;&s;on therein, is, <HI>What Help or A&s;&s;i&s;tance may we expect from the Holy Vir|gin?</HI> It is to be ob&s;erv'd here, the Que&s;tion does not &s;ay <HI>by</HI> the Holy Virgin, or <HI>by her Interce&s;&s;ion,</HI> but <HI>from</HI> the H. Virgin. And the An&s;wer &s;ays and teaches the People, That <HI>&s;he helps us in all that is profitable to us, and e&s;pecially in our la&s;t Hours: &s;he &s;trengthens the Weak, &s;he comforts the Sick, &s;he keeps off Tem|ptations, and &s;he helps us to everla&s;ting Salva|tion.</HI></P>
<P>Images of the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> are very frequent|ly <NOTE PLACE="marg">Images.</NOTE> to be &s;een about the Streets of this City: &s;ometimes we &s;ee them over the Doors of pri|vate Hou&s;es on the out-&s;ide; and there are very few, I believe, that have not one at lea&s;t, within. They are very common at the Cor|ners of the Streets, and over the Doors of tho&s;e call'd <HI>Religious Hou&s;es.</HI> The&s;e Images are often honour'd with a Crown on the Head, and a Sceptre in the Hand; and &s;ometimes on each &s;ide an Angel is &s;et upon his Knees with Hands lifted up together in the Po&s;ture of praying to her. Men and Women as they pa&s;s by the&s;e Images, commonly pay their Re|&s;pects to them in their &s;everal ways. I have &s;een a Child of four or five years old, as it has been running carele&s;ly by an Image of the Virgin, which was far above it, and not ob|&s;erv'd, has been &s;topp'd by the Parents and di|rected to look up, and make a reverend Courte&s;ie to the Stone, and &s;ay, <HI>Good Mother.</HI> All the publick Lanthorns of the City, and commonly tho&s;e in the Portals of private Hou&s;es, are hung up before an Image of the
<PB N="24" REF="29"> Virgin, and 'tis an Honour paid to her to pre|&s;ent a Candle to burn before the Image. I have &s;een an Image of her over a private Hou&s;e, in the Arms of which was con&s;tantly laid &s;ome|what of the be&s;t that the Earth affords in its Sea&s;on; and have &s;een &s;ome of the fir&s;t of &s;ome &s;orts of Flowers, the fir&s;t ripe Cherries, and the like, pre&s;ented to her; which is an Ho|mage eternally due to Almighty God, but to none el&s;e. The&s;e Practices &s;uit with what they call her in their Litanies, that is, <HI>Queen of An|gels,</HI> and <HI>Queen of Heaven and Earth.</HI> In mo&s;t Shops of the City is an Image of the Virgin, and when Evening comes, it is the Cu&s;tom to light a Candle and &s;et it up before that; which is ju&s;t as the Heathens were wont to honour the I|mages of their Hou&s;hold-Gods. And indeed the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, with a great deal of Guilt, has in many things reviv'd the old Corruptions of Religion, which the Heathens fell into, as will be further ob&s;erv'd in the Sequel of this Rela|tion. The Images of the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> are al&s;o commonly &s;et over the publick Pumps in this City: over that in the Fi&s;h-Market is one, which was con&s;ecrated a few Years ago in the Je&s;uits Chapel, and brought in a &s;olemn and pompous Proce&s;&s;ion by the Je&s;uits, to be &s;et up in this place. Under the Feet of the Woman are the&s;e Words of Scripture applied to her; <HI>A Well of Living Water:</HI> and another <HI>Dutch</HI> In|&s;cription calls her, <HI>Mary of good Succe&s;s.</HI> There is al&s;o, as I remember, at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> an Image of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> which is call'd <HI>Maria Pacis:</HI> We met al&s;o in this Journey with another I|mage, of which more will be &s;aid hereafter, which is call'd <HI>Notre Dame de Pierre,</HI> or our
<PB N="25" REF="29"> Lady of the Stone; where People go to pray to the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> when they are afflicted with Stone or Gravel. Tho&s;e who have travell'd further than we, know, that there are ma|ny things of the like nature u&s;ual in the <HI>Ro|man</HI> Church. But the&s;e things are put toge|ther here, as what do evidently betray the true Notion of the Papi&s;ts concerning the Images of the Saints through all the Di&s;gui&s;es and &s;pe|cious Repre&s;entations which they put upon their U&s;e of them. The Bi&s;hop of <HI>Meaux,</HI> after the Council of <HI>Trent,</HI> would have it thought they do not believe there is any Virtue in their Images, or that any Tru&s;t is to be put in them. The Heathens believ'd, that when an Image was made and con&s;ecrated to repre|&s;ent any of their Gods, this was, as it were, a Symbol of the pre&s;ence of that Deity where ever it was put: they believ'd the Vir|tue and Power of that Deity in and with that Image, and to be, as it were, bound to it &s;o as to be exerci&s;ed there, and to be removed with it. And the common Practice of the Papi&s;ts evidently declares they have the &s;ame Opinion of their Images: what other account can be given of their going to one Image of the &s;ame Saint for one Benefit, and to another for a|nother? They pretend to obtain good Succe&s;s at one of the&s;e Images, Peace at another, and Cure of the Stone at another. Their very Form of con&s;ecrating their Images, &s;hows they expect the Virtue of the Saint &s;hall attend the Image. In an old Pontifical which <HI>Chemnitius</HI> a <HI>Lutheran</HI> Divine of <HI>Germany</HI> had, and which he mentions in his <HI>Examen</HI> of the Council of <HI>Trent,</HI> he found this Form of con|&s;ecrating
<PB N="26" REF="30"> an Image of the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin:
<Q>Sanctifie, O God, this Form of the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, that it may bring &s;alutary A&s;&s;i|&s;tance to they Faithful People; That Thunders and hurtful Lightnings may be drove away; That Inundations of Waters, Commotions of Civil Wars, or Inva&s;ions, and Deva&s;tati|ons of Heathen Nations may be &s;topp'd and &s;uppre&s;s'd.</Q></P>
<P>'Tis true, there is &s;ince that time a new E|dition of the Pontifical over&s;een and appoint|ed by Pope <HI>Clement</HI> VIII. which he enjoyned to be every where u&s;ed, and at the &s;ame time he &s;uppre&s;s'd and forbid the U&s;e of any other; and this by an Act dated <HI>Feb.</HI> 10th. 1596. In this new one the Prayer for ble&s;&s;ing or con|&s;ecrating &s;uch an Image, is &s;omewhat alter'd in Words, but it evidently and fully expre&s;&s;es this Opinion of their Images. In one <HI>Antiphon</HI> in the Office for that purpo&s;e they &s;peak thus:
<Q>We betake our &s;elves to thy Protection, O Holy Mother of God, de&s;pi&s;e not our De|precations in our Nece&s;&s;ities, but free us from all Danger always, O Glorious and Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin.</Q></P>
<P>And, while the Company are &s;inging this, the Bi&s;hop who con&s;ecrates, Incen&s;es the Image three times. The concluding Prayer in the Of|fice &s;peaks home to the purpo&s;e in the&s;e Words:
<Q><PB N="27" REF="30"><HI>Almighty Eternal God, by who&s;e mo&s;t gracious Di&s;pen&s;ation all things were created out of nothing; vouch&s;afe, we be&s;eech thee, to ble&s;s</HI> &cross; [Here he makes a Cro&s;s over the Image] <HI>and &s;anctifie &cross; this Image, re|verently prepar'd and fitted in Honour of the Mother of thy ble&s;&s;ed Son our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; And grant, O mo&s;t merciful Father, by the Invocation of thy Holy Name, and of the &s;ame thy only begotten Son our Lord Je|&s;ue Chri&s;t (who for the Salvation of Man|kind, the Integrity of the Virgin</HI> Mary <HI>being pre&s;erved, thou wa&s;t willing &s;hould be Incar|nate) through the Prayers of the &s;ame mo&s;t H. Virgin, that who&s;oever &s;hall &s;et them|&s;elves humbly to honour the &s;ame Queen of Mercy, and our mo&s;t gracious Lady before this Effigies, may be delivered out of any imminent Dangers, and may obtain in thy &s;ight the Pardon of any Sins they have com|mitted, and may merit for the pre&s;ent to obtain that Grace or Favour which they de&s;ire, and may hereafter rejoyce with thine Elect in everla&s;ting Salvation, by the &s;ame our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t thy Son, who with thee in the Unity of the Holy Spirit liveth and reigneth one God world without end.</HI> Amen.</Q></P>
<P>Here we &s;ee plainly, that they do expect in general the removing of all Evil, and the ob|taining of all Good by praying before &s;uch a con&s;ecrated Image; which &s;ignifies that they expect to find here the pre&s;ence of the Deity repre&s;ented by the Image, and that this God|de&s;s will here exert her Power to their A&s;&s;i|&s;tance,
<PB N="28" REF="31"> according to the Notions and Expecta|tions of the Heathen. A further Specimen of their Practice agreeable to this Repre&s;entation of it, we had in the Year 1696. which they were not a&s;ham'd to publi&s;h to the World in the common Intelligences. A certain Image of the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> in greater E&s;teem than or|dinary for the Feats done, as the People may think, by it, was brought into the Chamber of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> he being at that time indi&s;|pos'd, this was in order to obtain of the Virgin the Cure of his Di&s;temper. Some time after he recover'd, as how could it be otherwi&s;e, and upon his fir&s;t going abroad, he return'd the Vi&s;it this Image had made him, and went to that to give his Thanks there for his Recovery. It is an u&s;ual thing among them for the Prie&s;ts to tell the People concerning &s;ome Images of the Virgin on the Sea-coa&s;ts, That after a &s;tor|my Night, the Petticoats on the Image &s;hall be &s;oundly dabbl'd; which, they &s;ay, is occa&s;ion'd by her having been abroad that Night bu&s;ie at the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mariners that call'd upon her in their Di&s;tre&s;s: Do they then teach the Peo|ple that there is a Pre&s;ence of the Deity or Saint with the Image to help them or not? A|gain, when they make long Pilgrimages to one Image of a Saint, and pay extraordinary De|votions there, and pa&s;s by, perhaps, an hun|dred Images of the &s;ame Saint in their Jour|ney, with a common Salutation, is not this be|cau&s;e they believe the Pre&s;ence of the Saint to be more with one Image than another, be|cau&s;e they expect rather to meet with the Virtue of the Saint there, and put &s;ome Tru&s;t in that Image more than in another?
<PB N="29" REF="31"> We met with many of the&s;e fooli&s;h and idle People called <HI>Pilgrims,</HI> in our Journey, between <NOTE PLACE="marg">Pilgrims.</NOTE> <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> and <HI>Louvaine,</HI> and between that and <HI>Mae&s;tricht;</HI> and again, between <HI>Cologne</HI> and <HI>Du&s;&s;eldorp.</HI> They were commonly in Troops, &s;ometimes near Twenty together, and many of them young Fellows and Wenches that &s;eem'd to be got together from their Friends and Relations for &s;ome other purpo&s;es than Devo|tion.</P>
<P>There are Five Pari&s;h Churches in this Ci|ty <NOTE PLACE="marg">Pari&s;h-Churches.</NOTE> of <HI>Antwerp,</HI> and a great number of the Chapels of tho&s;e call'd Religious Orders. The Clergy who po&s;&s;e&s;s the Pari&s;h Churches, and &s;erve the Wor&s;hip there, are call'd Secular Prie&s;ts, while the Monks and Friers are call'd Regular ones, and Religious; as if they who are &s;uch according to the In&s;titution of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, were Men of the common World, and only of humane In&s;titution; but the&s;e who are truly a &s;ort of meerly humane Invention, were the only ones that were &s;et up according to Rule. But it is to be ob&s;erved for the better Explanation of this matter, that the Monks do, when they &s;peak out, acknowledge them&s;elves Regulars, according to a Rule of humane In|vention; for &s;ome are &s;aid to follow the Rule of St. <HI>Francis,</HI> &s;ome the Rule of St. <HI>Dominick,</HI> &s;ome the Rule of the &s;pecial St. <HI>Ignatius Loyola.</HI> According to Truth therefore the Names ought to be chang'd to remove the Abu&s;e of them, and the Regulars &s;hould be call'd Secu|lar, and the Seculars, Regular. The Monks and Friars are known by the Habit of their Order; the Prie&s;ts of the Pari&s;h Churches have commonly one Garb all over the&s;e Countries,
<PB N="30" REF="32"> which is a black Cloak and a little Band.</P>
<P>The olde&s;t and the meane&s;t of the Pari&s;h-Churches is that dedicated to St. <HI>Walburg,</HI> men|tion'd before, which was the fir&s;t Church of the City; and in times of Heatheni&s;m, they &s;ay it was a Temple dedicated to <HI>Mars.</HI> The high Altar here has over it a good piece of Painting done by <HI>Rubens,</HI> which repre&s;ents our Saviour as taking down from the Cro&s;s. There are al|&s;o &s;ome other very good Pieces of Painting in that part of the Church, to which one a&s;cends by a great many Steps from the re&s;t of the Church.</P>
<P>Near that call'd the <HI>George's Gate</HI> &s;tands ano|ther of the&s;e, which is dedicated to St. <HI>George,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">St. George.</NOTE> who is e&s;teem'd by the Popi&s;h Church the Pa|tron and Protector of <HI>England.</HI> For as the Heathens had their Gods of Nations and Cities, &s;o the Papi&s;ts have their Saints for the &s;ame purpo&s;es. As for this St. <HI>George,</HI> 'tis certain that no ancient Hi&s;tory of the Church makes any mention of him: and 'tis very likely he came to be in Repute for Wor&s;hip ju&s;t as a great many other of the <HI>Roman</HI> Saints have done: That is, &s;ome Monk or other pretends to have a Vi&s;ion in which &s;uch a Per&s;on appear'd to him, and told him he was formerly &s;uch an one, and that they mu&s;t for their A&s;&s;i&s;tance in &s;ome real or pretended Di&s;tre&s;s, &s;et up a Method of De|votion to him. Such as this is all the Foun|dation which they have for the Wor&s;hip of many of their pretended Saints. Are they not then herein liable to our Saviour's Re|proach of the <HI>Samaritans,</HI> that they wor&s;hip they know not what? It is very probable there never was in the World any &s;uch Per&s;on
<PB N="31" REF="32"> as this St. <HI>George:</HI> They know not at what time to &s;et him; &s;ome a&s;&s;ign him the Third Century, and &s;me the Fourth. They agree indeed to have him a Martyr under <HI>Diocle&s;ian:</HI> They generally confe&s;s, that the Acts of his Martyrdom are lo&s;t, and they know no parti|cular Circum&s;tances concerning it. <HI>Baronius</HI> believes that the common manner of repre|&s;enting him, which is as &s;itting upon a Hor&s;e, and piercing a Dragon under his Hor&s;e's Feet with a Spear, and having a Woman &s;tanding behind him in the Po&s;ture of a Supplicant, does not de&s;ign a true Story; for he could not find any the lea&s;t Foot&s;tep of &s;uch a thing in ancient Hi&s;tory; therefore he would have this a &s;ymbolical Repre&s;entation, and de&s;ign'd to expre&s;s the Univer&s;al Devotion of the Church, which implores the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of this Saint a|gain&s;t the Attacks of its Enemies. This Church of St. <HI>George</HI> is not very fine, nor, I believe, much frequented. They are in want of a fine Thing in which they expo&s;e their <HI>Ho&s;tie</HI> to the View of the People, when 'tis only to be &s;een and a|dor'd, which from the <HI>Dutch</HI> Word I &s;hall call a <HI>Remon&s;tranter;</HI> therefore a &s;trong Box is &s;et <NOTE PLACE="marg">Remon|&s;tranter.</NOTE> upon a Po&s;t in the Church, with a Hole to put Money in at, and an In&s;cription by it, &s;ays, <HI>Here the Offerings are put that are de&s;ign'd for a new Remon&s;tranter.</HI> It is a thing with a Foot like a Chalice, upon which it can &s;tand; from a Stem which goes up a little, from that there a|&s;cends a fine flouri&s;h'd Work which is &s;ome|times a Foot or a Foot and half deep, and of a proportionable Breadth. In the middle of this between two Oval or Round Chry&s;tals, is put an <HI>Ho&s;tie,</HI> that is, the white Wafer which
<PB N="32" REF="33"> they u&s;e in the Sacrament of the Lord's Sup|per. It is &s;et upon its edge, and can be &s;een on both &s;ides of the thing: in &s;uch a thing as this they always carry the <HI>Ho&s;tie</HI> in Proce&s;&s;ions; and the matter of the&s;e things is u&s;ually Silver, and &s;ometimes gilded with Gold, and perhaps &s;et with precious Stones, and hung with little Silver Bells. When they carry the Sacrament to the Sick, they have it in a Chalice, and do not &s;how it. In the Year 1695. in the Yard belonging to this Church there was erected an Imitation of Mount <HI>Calvary,</HI> which &s;eems to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mount Cal|vary.</NOTE> grow much in e&s;teem and to be well frequent|ed; as one &s;ees the newe&s;t things commonly mo&s;t valued in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> new Saints, new Altars, new Indulgences, notwith&s;tand|ing their pretence to Antiquity in all they do, and to value them&s;elves and their Fopperies for that. There is a little Mount rai&s;ed with Turfs, which ri&s;es gradually from the Level to the height of above 7 or 8 Feet at the upper end. There is &s;et a Crucifix which was con&s;e|crated upon the &s;pot. The Cro&s;s, as yet, is painted only with a plain red Colour, and the Body with white, but in time both may come to be finer; for the Trick takes and gathers Mo|ney. It &s;tood naked for &s;ome time, but with a &s;trong Box upon a Po&s;t at the Foot of the A|&s;cent to receive Money; and after a time Benches were &s;et upon the Hill for People to kneel upon; then two Pictures upon boards cut to the Shape of them, were &s;et at the Foot of the Cro&s;s, the one repre&s;enting the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> the other St. <HI>John;</HI> and now it is en|compa&s;s'd with a Plantation of Trees, and the Mount is &s;urrounded with a good quick-&s;et
<PB N="33" REF="33"> Hedge. People are often &s;een praying there at all hours of the Day; &s;ome upon the Ground, &s;ome kneeling on the Benches; &s;ometimes as they kneel before the Crucifix, they &s;tretch out their Hands, and hang down their Heads, and &s;o remain &s;ome time in that Po&s;ture, imitating that of the Body on the Cro&s;s. Without doubt they are excellent Followers of our Saviour herein. Sometimes a Quea&s;il or devout Wo|man that has a great Opinion of her own San|ctity, thru&s;ts her &s;elf among the great Folks at the Foot of the Cro&s;s, and kneels there at her De|votions: &s;ometimes one &s;hall &s;ee People creeping round the Cro&s;s upon their Knees, and dropping their Beads as they go, to perform, 'tis likely, &s;ome voluntary or enjoin'd Task of Devotion.</P>
<P>Having mention'd Quea&s;ils, I mu&s;t &s;ay what <NOTE PLACE="marg">Quea&s;ils.</NOTE> they are. I think the Name is given in the&s;e Countries only to Women; it &s;ignifies a de|vout Per&s;on: there are Multitudes of them in this City; they are particularly devoted to &s;ome Saint, or to &s;ome Religious Order; they bind them&s;elves to &s;ome particular Tasks of Devo|tion to that Saint, and belong to a Religious Fraternity, of which more will be &s;aid here|after: &s;ome therefore belong to the Pari&s;h-Churches where are the Chappels which they frequent; and &s;ome belong to the Religious Orders, &s;o that &s;ome of them are call'd the Je&s;uits Quea&s;ils; and it was &s;aid, There is one Je&s;uit in the Hou&s;e at <HI>Antwerp</HI> that had made Three&s;core Quea&s;ils; &s;ome again are call'd <HI>Minorite Quea&s;ils,</HI> &amp;c. They &s;ay they wear &s;ome Garment under their outermo&s;t Cloaths, which is in the Shape of the Habit of the Or|der they belong to: 'tis &s;uppos'd the Monks
<PB N="34" REF="34"> to whom they belong, and who are their Di|rectors look to it that they do &s;o; for this a|mong other things, they oblige them&s;elves to do. They do not &s;olemnly vow a &s;ingle Life, as Nuns do, but they pretend to purpo&s;e it; &s;o that tho' &s;ome of them do marry, 'tis rec|kon'd &s;candalous to do &s;o, and is very &s;eldom done. They live about in the City in their own Hou&s;es, and are in Trades; &s;ome of them are Ser|vant-Maids. They pay all their Devotionsin the Chappels of the Order they belong to ordinarily. They make frequent Pre&s;ents to that Order, and &s;ometimes con&s;iderable ones at their Death; which makes the Je&s;uits indu&s;triou&s;ly wheedle to them&s;elves the riche&s;t. One of their Quea|&s;ils died a few Years ago, and left them a good E&s;tate near the City, with a noble Seat upon it, about which are all the Plea&s;ures of Gardens; this is their Countrey-hou&s;e, to and from which one &s;hall often &s;ee them pa&s;&s;ing. Their out|ward Habit is Black, with a broad Cambrick Band round their Shoulders, and a black Peak on their Forehead, &s;o that they are dre&s;s'd as in Mourning, and as Widows.</P>
<P>The Church of St. <HI>Andrew</HI> is another of the five Parochial ones. It is a hand&s;om Church, has the Altars rich and well adorn'd on high Days. In the Windows there is &s;ome Paint|ing, and it &s;eems to be &s;ome of the be&s;t of the kind I ever &s;aw, tho' I have &s;een tho&s;e at <HI>Goude</HI> in <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>Another of the Parochial Churches, and one of the fine&s;t in the City, is that of St. <HI>James,</HI> &s;tanding between the <HI>Kip-dorp-&s;treet,</HI> and the long new Street. It is a very lofty and magni|ficent Building. There is a Beginning of a
<PB N="35" REF="34"> Steeple already advanc'd to a good height, and de&s;ign'd to have been much higher, but the De&s;ign and Work has been laid a&s;ide for &s;ome time. It is a Collegiate Church, and is built in the Form of a Cathedral. Over the <HI>We&s;tern</HI> Door on the out&s;ide, one may read the&s;e Words; which are &s;et under an Image of St. <HI>James; Apo&s;tolus Divus Jacobus Major, gra|tus hujus Patronus.</HI> Over the Portal, which is &s;upported with va&s;t Marble Pillars, there are the&s;e Words in Golden Letters written, <HI>Divo Jacobo &s;acrum.</HI> Certainly the&s;e Words &s;igni|fie &s;omething more than that they only apply to St. <HI>James</HI> for the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Interce&s;|&s;ion, with the &s;ame Spirit of Charity with which we de&s;ire our Friends on Earth to pray for us; which is the Interpretation that the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Meaux</HI> puts upon their Invocations of the Saints. The Erecting and Dedicating a Church to the Honour of a Saint, wherein he is to be invocated and applied to with Offi|ces of Wor&s;hip, does not certainly look &s;o much like an Exerci&s;e of Charity, as of Devotion. The Heathens thought this a Divine Honour, and &s;uch, without doubt, the People of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> take it to be. Certainly none of us pay an Honour like this to any the be&s;t of our Friends on Earth, when we de&s;ire to be remembred in their Prayers. In this In|&s;cription the Saint is mention'd alone, as if the Church were intirely dedicated to him. Sometimes in an In&s;cription over the Door of a Church, or over an Altar, they have &s;o much the Remembrance of Almighty God as to men|tion him together with the Saint; as at a Cha|pel of the Je&s;uits in their Countrey-hou&s;e a|bovemention'd,
<PB N="36" REF="35"> near <HI>Antwerp,</HI> there are the&s;e Words over the Door; <HI>Deo O. M. &amp; Sancto Ignatio &s;acrum.</HI> But whether the Invocation of the Saints in the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> be done with the Spirit of Charity or Devotion, and whether the Honours paid them are divine or not, will be&s;t appear by a true Repre&s;entation of their Practice in &s;uch Particulars as I have ob&s;erv'd and &s;een, and by the Devotions which attend the Fe&s;tivals of the Saints. The Ac|count of the&s;e I &s;hall give from them&s;elves in &s;ome In&s;tances, as I have learnt them by the following means. They have &s;o many Holi|days in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> ob&s;erv'd by &s;ome or other among them, that they find it nece&s;|&s;ary to publi&s;h and give notice of them &s;ome Days before by printed Papers po&s;ted up a|bout the Cities, which are chiefly &s;et at the Doors of Churches or Religious Hou&s;es. And the&s;e, like our Play-hou&s;e-Bills, give an Ac|count what Devotions are to be perform'd on tho&s;e Days, and what Indulgences are granted to encourage them, and where the&s;e are to be obtain'd. Having had the Curio&s;ity to collect a number of the&s;e Papers, I &s;hall tran&s;|late and in&s;ert &s;ome of them in proper places in this Relation. Since we are now at St. <HI>James</HI>'s Church, I &s;hall in&s;ert here the Publi|cation of his Fe&s;tival, as it is celebrated in this Church; which is as follows:</P>
<FLOATEXT LANG="eng" TYPE="indulgence">
<HEAD>Plenary Indulgence</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>To be obtain'd in the Collegiate and Parochial Church of St.</HI> James, <HI>upon the Fea&s;t-day of the &s;ame Saint and glorious Apo&s;tle</HI> James, <HI>particular Patron and Protector of the King|dom of</HI> Spain.</HEAD>
<PB N="37" REF="35">
<P>Upon the 25th of this Month, being the Fea&s;t-day of the holy and glorious Apo&s;tle <HI>James,</HI> hath our Holy Father <HI>Innocent</HI> XI. Pope of <HI>Rome,</HI> granted a Plenary Indulgence (beginning from the fir&s;t <HI>Ve&s;pers,</HI> that is, at the <HI>Ve&s;pers</HI> of the day before) to all faithful Chri&s;tians, who, with &s;incere Repentance be|ing confe&s;s'd, and having receiv'd the holy Sacrament of the Altar, &s;hall upon the Fea&s;t|day of the H. Apo&s;tle <HI>James,</HI> vi&s;it his Church, and pray for the Union of Chri&s;tian Princes, the Extirpation of Here&s;ie, and the Advance|ment of our Mother the H. Church.</P>
<P>To this end, in the Morning before Mattins &s;hall the holy Sacrament of the Altar be ex|pos'd in the hig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> Quire, and &s;hall continue &s;o the whole day.</P>
<P>At Eight a Clock &s;hall be preached the or|dinary Sermon by the Reverend the Pleban and Canon of the &s;ame Church. At Nine a Clock a very &s;olemn Ma&s;s in Mu&s;ick &s;hall be perform'd: At half an hour after Ten &s;hall the Sermon be preach'd; after which at half an hour after Eleven there &s;hall be a &s;olemn Ma&s;s in Mu&s;ick provided by the Captain of the <HI>Mi|litia</HI> of this City. Afternoon at Two a Clock &s;hall be perform'd the &s;olemn <HI>Ve&s;pers;</HI> at Three a Clock a Sermon, at Four a &s;olemn Laud in the high Quire, and then this Plenary Indul|gence &s;hall be concluded with the Benedicti|on of the high and holy Sacrament of the Altar.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, it is de&s;ir'd of the good People and Pari&s;hioners of St. <HI>James</HI>'s, that they would earne&s;tly pray through the Interce&s;&s;ion of their Patron, that they may al&s;o be pre&s;erv'd from
<PB N="38" REF="36"> violent and ha&s;ty Sickne&s;&s;es and all Misfortunes.</P>
</FLOATEXT>
<P>All this is to be done in Honour of this Saint, and to obtain his Interce&s;&s;ion; and the People are encourag'd by the Pope him&s;elf to attend the&s;e Devotions by a Plenary Indulgence. Is this to be parallel'd then with our de&s;iring our Friends on Earth to pray for us? Has the Saint &s;o little Charity, and is he &s;o backward to intercede, that without all this ado he will not open his Mouth for them? This is much that is to be done on this Occa&s;ion, and yet is little to what is done to the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> who has a great many Fe&s;tivals in a Year, and they attended with whole <HI>Octaves,</HI> on which particular and extraordinary Devotions are paid to her. The true meaning of all, is plain|ly this: Mankind has been always taught, and have believ'd the nece&s;&s;ity of a Mediator, and that a Divine Per&s;on mu&s;t be our Mediator, and Divine Honours are due, and may be paid to whom&s;oever is &s;o; &s;ince this appears in the whole Theology of the Heathens, and is &s;o a|greeable to the Truths which are taught us in the Go&s;pel, we have rea&s;on to believe they deriv'd this Knowledge from the Fathers of the World by Tradition, to whom it had been re|veal'd by God him&s;elf. But the Heathens, having only Tradition to guide them, corrupt|ed this Doctrine by bringing in a Multitude of Mediators; whereas the Go&s;pel, according to the truth of the matter, teaches us, that there is but one Mediator between God and Man, and that is Chri&s;t Je&s;us. This Corruption is reviv'd in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> who has many Mediators, and adores them all, and pays them
<PB N="39" REF="36"> Divine Honours, as the Heathens did. More of this we &s;hall &s;ee in the following Relation.</P>
<P>Over the high Altar in this Church of St. <HI>James,</HI> in the Quire, is a very co&s;tly, large and beautiful piece of Architecture all of Marble. The Pillars on the &s;ides are &s;ome of them white Marble, &s;ome black, the white wreath'd, theblack &s;mooth and &s;trait, and they are intermix'd with curious Art; the whole is certainly a Work ve|ry admirable. In&s;tead of a Picture for an Al|tar-piece, there is an Image of St. <HI>James</HI> big|ger than the common Size of Men, which is of white Marble. He is repre&s;ented as looking upwards, and pointing downwards to the People below. Over his Head in the Arch of the Marble-work about him, and towards which he directs his Face, there is carv'd the impious and idolatrous Repre&s;entation of the holy Trinity, which is very common in the Churches of the <HI>Roman</HI> Communion. There is <NOTE PLACE="marg">Image of the Holy Trinity.</NOTE> the Figure of an Old Man &s;itting in the Clouds, with a Triple Crown on his Head, and of a Young Man by him, holding a Cro&s;s with one Hand; and between them both is a Pidgeon hovering with his Wings &s;pread, and Rays a|bout him. I do not doubt but it is lawful to repre&s;ent the humane Body of Je&s;us Chri&s;t our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, in any of the Circum&s;tances of his Life or Death on Earth, either by Pi|ctures or by Images. But certainly, as it is the Glory of the Divine Nature to be invi&s;ible in it &s;elf, &s;o it ought not to be repre&s;ented by any vi&s;ible thing. God him&s;elf adds an expre&s;s Pro|hibition of making any vi&s;ible Repre&s;entation of him&s;elf, as an Explication of the &s;econd Commandment. And the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> judges
<PB N="40" REF="37"> it an impious profanation to do &s;o, and calls it a Changing the Glory of the invi&s;ible God into the meanne&s;s of that thing which the Image made to repre&s;ent him, does more truly repre|&s;ent. He &s;ays therefore of the Heathens <HI>(Rom.</HI> 1.) that while they made the Images of of Men or Birds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to repre&s;ent the Deity by, they chang'd the Glory of God into an I|mage made like to corruptible Man, and to Birds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> What does the practice of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> in this ca&s;e differ from theirs? 'Tis true, the Go&s;pel tells us, when Je&s;us was ba|ptized and came out of the Water, the Spirit of God did with a vi&s;ible Repre&s;entation de|&s;cend upon him, whereby the Man Je&s;us be|came the Chri&s;t of God. A vi&s;ible Glory de|&s;cended like the hovering of a Dove, and light|ed upon him, to be a &s;en&s;ible Token and De|mon&s;tration to the Spectators, that he was a|nointed by the Holy Gho&s;t, and was to be reckon'd by them the true Me&s;&s;iah or Chri&s;t. But this does not at all allow or conclude for the repre&s;enting the holy infinite Spirit him|&s;elf by a Pidgeon. The <HI>Shechinah</HI> or Pillar of a Glory in the Wilderne&s;s, was a Token of God's &s;pecial pre&s;ence among the people of <HI>I&s;|rael</HI> there, but was not a fit Repre&s;entation of the infinitely glorious God him&s;elf; nor was it de&s;ign'd to be &s;o, but only for a &s;en&s;ible To|ken and A&s;&s;urance of a peculiar divine pre|&s;ence. The Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> when pre&s;s'd with things of this Nature, endeavours to e|vade the Argument by blaming the Liberty of Carvers and Painters; but there is no room at all to do it in this ca&s;e. For this is a thing done by publick Allowance, and encourag'd by the
<PB N="41" REF="37"> Authority of the Church, as we &s;hall be con|vinc'd in the Sequel of this Relation. At pre|&s;ent I &s;hall add to this purpo&s;e what is further to be ob&s;erv'd in this &s;ame Church. In the pa&s;&s;age round the Quire, on the out&s;ide, where are &s;everal very neat Chapels to particular Saints, enclos'd with partitions of Marble Pil|lars or Rails; there is &s;et up again&s;t the Wall in a Frame a printed Repre&s;entation of the ho|ly Trinity, contriv'd after the &s;ame manner with the former, and under it there is print|ed in <HI>Dutch</HI> this Grant; <HI>Who&s;oever &s;hall &s;ay here Five Pater No&s;ters, and Five Ave-Marys, &s;hall enjoy Forty Days Indulgence; this granted by the Bi&s;hop of</HI> Antwerp. The Quire is part of it compa&s;s'd with beautiful Marble-pillars: there is a great deal of good Painting, and abundance of Marble about the whole Church.</P>
<P>In this Church by the entrance of the <HI>North</HI> Door on the Left-hand, is a large Chappel which they call <HI>The Chappel of the Dead.</HI> The Altar|piece repre&s;ents our Saviour as dead, and ta|king down from the Cro&s;s, and lying in the Lap of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> who &s;its in a very &s;or|rowful po&s;ture contemplating upon the matter. On the out-&s;ide of the partition upon a pillar, there hangs in a Frame, written in <HI>Dutch,</HI> a new Grant in Favour of this Chapel.

<P>We come now to the greate&s;t of the Pa|rochial Churches, which is the Cathedral Church here: 'tis call'd the <HI>Vrouwen Kerk,</HI> or <HI>Our Lady's Church,</HI> becau&s;e 'tis dedicated to the Virgin <HI>Mary.</HI> 'Tis a magnificent, large and curious Structure, worth admiring both with|out and within, and worth the &s;taying a while about it to take notice of what is here ob&s;erva|ble. The Foundations of this Church, they &s;ay, were laid in the Year 1124 it was former|ly Collegiate only, and entertain'd 24 Chanon|ries, with a Dean. But <HI>Philip</HI> the Second King of <HI>Spain,</HI> out of a De&s;ign to pre&s;erve the <HI>Ro|man</HI> Religion in the&s;e Countries, erected &s;eve|ral new Bi&s;hopricks among them, as what he
<PB N="43" REF="38"> thought mo&s;t conducing to this purpo&s;e. One of the&s;e fell to the Share of this City, and the fir&s;t Bi&s;hop is named <HI>Franci&s;cus Sonnius,</HI> who was fixed about the Year 1567. This Church has a great deal of curious carv'd Stone-work on the Out&s;ide, which adorns the lofty Roof of it, and is &s;een above the Hou&s;es that encom|pa&s;s it. The Steeple is all Stone from the bot|tom to the top; it is in height 400 <HI>Antwerp</HI> Feet: from thence in a clear day may be di|&s;tinctly &s;een <HI>Mechlin, Louvain, Bru&s;&s;els, Ghent,</HI> the Sea, and the I&s;lands of <HI>Zeeland</HI> with the naked Eye. The whole Steeple has &s;o much carving about it, and is &s;uch curious Work, that they &s;ay the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> V. viewing it, and con&s;idering that Time and Weather mu&s;t needs deface the Beauty of it, as is in &s;ome mea&s;ure already done, &s;aid, <HI>It was worthy to be kept in a Ca&s;e, and to be &s;hown only upon Holi|days.</HI> In this Steeple there is a Set of perhaps the mo&s;t mu&s;ical Chimes in the World; to &s;erve which, there are of all Sorts in the Stee|ple 68 Bells. The Church is very fine and rich within, in excellent Pieces of Painting in Marble and Bra&s;s Pillars; and the Altars on high Days are adorn'd with a great deal of Riches in Silver Lamps, and Candle&s;ticks, and other Works of Silver. The&s;e being in|termix'd very artificially, with Bundles of Flowers, true in their Sea&s;on, and &s;uch are well counterfeited in Winter, with Bay-trees al&s;o, and tall lighted Wax-Tapers, all together, make the mo&s;t beautiful Scenes in the World. And when there is added to the&s;e a Con&s;ort of all &s;orts of excellent Mu&s;ick, as on &s;ome Holi|days the Ma&s;s and all the other Offices of the
<PB N="44" REF="39"> Day are perform'd in Mu&s;ick, then they make the Church out-do the Play-hou&s;e in that which is mo&s;t plea&s;ant there; tho perhaps the&s;e things are not very proper to be mingled with Chri&s;tian Wor&s;hip, which is de&s;ign'd rather to refine and purifie the mind of Man, and to ele|vate it to God and Divine Things, than to plea&s;e and charm the Sences with the Pomps and Plea&s;ures of this World. There are a great many Altars in this Church continually, and to &s;ome of them are granted the obtaining the &s;ame Indulgences which are to be gain'd in St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Church at <HI>Rome,</HI> by tho&s;e who &s;hall vi|&s;it the&s;e Altars on &s;uch and &s;uch Holidays of the Year, as are &s;pecified: This is &s;ignified by &s;ome Prints hanging in Frames in the Church in <HI>Latin,</HI> and in <HI>Low-Dutch:</HI> Be&s;ides the&s;e, upon &s;ome Occa&s;ions they erect new Altars for the time.</P>
<P>There are belonging to this Church &s;everal <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fraterni|ties.</NOTE> Confraternities, which take the Charge and Care upon them to furni&s;h and adorn par|ticular Chapels in it, and to maintain the Per|formance of Divine Offices in them Some of the&s;e it may not be ami&s;s to take notice of here. One is call'd <HI>the Fraternity of the Circumci&s;ion,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ts of 24 Principal Citizens, &s;ome Religious and &s;ome Secular. They maintain the Chapel of the Circumci&s;ion; where they pretend to keep and to &s;how upon particular occa&s;ions the Prepuce or Foreskin which was cut from our Saviour when he was circumcis'd. They &s;ay it was &s;ent hither by Duke <HI>Godfrey</HI> of <HI>Bulloine</HI> from <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> after that City had been recover'd from the Hands of the <HI>Mahome|tans,</HI> and he was voted K. of it in the Year 1101.
<PB N="45" REF="39"> Another Fraternity is call'd <HI>the Brotherhood of the Chappel of the Virgin Mary;</HI> which con&s;i&s;ts of almo&s;t an hundred Brothers, &s;ome Citizens &s;ome Foreigners.

<P>Another is the Fraternity of the Holy Sacra|ment, who have a Chapel enclos'd at the Ea&s;t end of the South I&s;le of the Church. The Par|tition here is, as I remember, all of Marble. This Altar I have ob&s;erv'd on great days &s;et off with a great deal of Riches and Finery; and
<PB N="46" REF="40"> the&s;e maintain here a Ma&s;s and Ve&s;pers with Mu&s;ick daily. To this Church al&s;o belong the 27 Colledges, as they are call'd, of Trade&s;men in this City, who have each of them a Chapel, or an Altar at lea&s;t; at which they maintain a Ma&s;s upon all Fe&s;tivals of the Year; but upon the Fea&s;ts of the Saints whom they reckon the Patrons of their Trade, they cau&s;e to be &s;ung a Solemn Ma&s;s with a Con&s;ort of Mu&s;ick.</P>
<P>There is in this Church at the top of the Lan|tern a piece of Painting which is very much ad|mir'd; it repre&s;ents a Heaven, as I remember: The Ma&s;ter that drew it is one <HI>Mees,</HI> who was lately living in the Town, and perhaps is &s;till there. Here are to be &s;een &s;everal of the no|ble Pieces of the famous <HI>Rubens</HI>'s drawing. As one comes in at the South Door of the Church there is a Piece of his at the fir&s;t Altar on the right hand: The Altar-piece repre&s;ents our Sa|viour a-taking down from the Cro&s;s. There are Folding-doors put up to open and &s;how, or to &s;hut and cover this piece. When they are open they &s;how on the in&s;ide of them more of his excellent Work; for he has drawn on one &s;ide the Vi&s;it which the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> made to her Cou&s;in <HI>Elizabeth:</HI> On the other &s;ide, I think, he has repre&s;ented the three Kings, as they call them, paying their Adorations to our Saviour at <HI>Bethlehem Rubens,</HI> they &s;ay, has &s;et a very good Picture of his Wife on the for|mer of the&s;e to repre&s;ent the Virgin <HI>Mary:</HI> Who was, as Tradition tells us, very hand&s;ome, but very wanton and &s;candalous. This puts me in mind of what is &s;aid to be a common practice among the <HI>Romani&s;ts</HI> in <HI>Italy</HI> and el&s;e|where; which is, That the Pictures made and
<PB N="47" REF="40"> &s;et up in the Churches to repre&s;ent the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> are commonly good and lively Draughts of tho&s;e lewd Women whom the wicked Pain|ters mo&s;t admir'd. One &s;ees them indeed u&s;u|ally the mo&s;t beautiful Repre&s;entations that the Painters Art can po&s;&s;ibly reach. But concern|ing this practice, I think it may be asked them, tho' not rea&s;onably que&s;tion'd, Whether the Pictures of &s;uch Women in tho&s;e places do a|dorn the Altar or profane the Church? It is ea&s;ie to determine how little a help to Devoti|on &s;uch Pictures mu&s;t be, e&s;pecially while they repre&s;ent more truely tho&s;e Women who are known to be vile and filthy, than the ble&s;&s;ed and pure Virgin who was the Mother of our Lord. The&s;e Folding-doors when &s;hut have another Picture on the out&s;ide newly drawn, and very well done; which, if one &s;hould look upon it after reading the Heathen Story of <HI>Hercules,</HI> one would conclude were a &s;winging <HI>Hercules</HI> with his Club. This is &s;et to repre&s;ent St. <HI>Chri&s;topher,</HI> and &s;o at its times this Altar &s;erves <NOTE PLACE="marg">St. Chri|&s;topher.</NOTE> for the Devotion to him. It is a Picture of a ve|ry large Gigantick Man walking, but who &s;eems &s;carce able to go under the load he bears, and therefore &s;upporting him&s;elf with his Club, which reaches up to his Arm-pit: And all this ado is only to carry a very little Boy that &s;its a&s;tride upon his Shoulder, and &s;eems very waggi&s;hly to laugh at the pains which he takes to carry him. The fooli&s;h Legend &s;ays, Our Saviour put a trick upon St. <HI>Chri&s;topher</HI> in the appea|rance of a little Child: He &s;tood crying by a Brook of Water which he made &s;how as if he mu&s;t go over but was afraid it would drown him; upon which the Saint took up the Child
<PB N="48" REF="41"> and to&s;s'd him upon his Shoulder thinking to carry him as in&s;en&s;ibly as a Fly, but by that time he was got to the middle of the Water the weight of this Child grew &s;o great, that he was hardly able to walk or &s;tand under him; and full glad was St. <HI>Chri&s;topher,</HI> who&s;e Back was almo&s;t broke, when he was gotten to the other &s;ide to be rid of his Burden. Becau&s;e he thus carried Chri&s;t, as they &s;ay, he had this Name of <HI>Chri&s;topher,</HI> which &s;ignifies a carryer of Chri&s;t. This indeed is a Story which the wi&s;e&s;t among them do not think fit to build up|on; and therefore they pretend that this Pi|cture is al&s;o &s;ymbolical, and repre&s;ents his car|rying our Saviour about in the Country where he preach'd the Go&s;pel; which was chiefly in <HI>Lycia,</HI> where they &s;ay he converted ju&s;t 46000 People to the Chri&s;tian Faith, and &s;uffer'd Martyrdom under the <HI>Decian</HI> Per&s;ecution. But even this matter al&s;o is owned to be un|certain; and a mode&s;t Author &s;ays, <HI>We know nothing that is well a&s;&s;ur'd of his Actions.</HI> How|ever he is commemorated as a Saint in Hea|ven by the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> on the 25th of <HI>Ju|ly;</HI> and that Church at a venture makes this Prayer with relation to Him at the Ma&s;s of that Day.
<Q><HI>Grant we be&s;eech thee, Almighty God, that by the Interce&s;&s;ion of the Ble&s;&s;ed St.</HI> Chri&s;topher, <HI>who&s;e Fe&s;tival we celebrate, we may be for|tified in the Love of thy Name, through our Lord,</HI> &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>It would be much too long a task to take par|ticular notice of all the &s;everal Altars in this
<PB N="49" REF="41"> Church. But certainly in the Church of the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin we mu&s;t not omit to pay our Re&s;pects to the High Altar which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">dedicated to her. And here, be&s;ides the excellent Ar|chitecture, worth taking notice of, we &s;ee an excellent piece of the famous <HI>Rubens</HI>'s drawing: <NOTE PLACE="marg">A&s;&s;umpti|on of the Virgin <HI>Mary.</HI></NOTE> This is the Altar-piece which repre&s;ents the pretended A&s;&s;umption or A&s;cention of the Vir|gin <HI>Mary</HI> into Heaven. There is painted a beautiful Woman cloath'd with rich Silks, mounting towards Heaven with Clouds under her Feet, a Glory all above her, and many Angels about her; &s;ome admiring, &s;ome ado|ring, and &s;ome &s;eeming to &s;houlder her up|wards. At the bottom of the piece is a Tomb open, and many Men and Women about it. &s;ome looking down into the Tomb, &s;ome &s;ta|ring upwards, and &s;heltring their Eyes with their Hands, as if they would defend them from being dazled by the Glory above them. They &s;ay &s;he did die indeed and was buried, but within three days afterwards &s;he ro&s;e again from the dead and was taken up into Heaven. And one would think by this repre&s;entation of the matter, that mo&s;t certainly &s;he a&s;cended into Heaven, as the Scripture &s;ays our Saviour did, that is, in the &s;ight of many people, and vi&s;ibly attended by Angels in his glorious Tri|umph. Thus is this matter con&s;tantly repre|&s;ented to the People in the Pictures of her A&s;|&s;umption, and thus are they taught, poor Peo|ple, by Pictures, which in the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> are the Lay-mens Books, to believe lies. For there is not one bit of all this that is true. The Apo&s;tles were Witne&s;&s;es of our Saviour's A&s;cen&s;ion, and have te&s;tify'd it &s;ufficiently to
<PB N="50" REF="42"> the World; but as for that of the Ble&s;&s;ed Vir|gin, tho' the <HI>Romani&s;ts</HI> pretend many of them were Witne&s;&s;es of that, yet there is not a word &s;aid of it in any of their Writings, nor do any of the Writings of the Ancients make any men|tion of it. 'Tis confe&s;t by a mode&s;t Author, That after the Scripture &s;peaks of her as &s;tand|ing by the Cro&s;s of our Saviour at the time of his Crucifixion, and her being then recommend|ed to St. <HI>John</HI> to be re&s;pected and taken care of by him as if &s;he were his own Mother, there is no more &s;aid of her in any Author that is certain, either concerning the re&s;t of her Life or concerning her Death. <HI>Authors &s;ay indeed,</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>that &s;he, having liv'd at</HI> Ephe&s;us <HI>with St.</HI> John, <HI>died there, at the Age of 72 Years, in the Year of our Saviour 56 or 57;</HI> but this is not at all certain he owns, as well as is not her A&s;|&s;umption; which it would without doubt have been if it had been true. For if ever the Spirit of God had de&s;ign'd &s;uch Honours for the Vir|gin <HI>Mary</HI> as are paid her by the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> this Circum&s;tance, which is one great foun|dation and encouragement of them, would have been order'd by the Divine Providence to have been a&s;certain'd beyond all rea&s;onable doubt or contradiction, as is the A&s;cen&s;ion of our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour. Another Author &s;ays <HI>(God|deau Hi&s;t. de l'Egli&s;e) The Church believes that &s;he was after her death receiv'd into Heaven both in Body and Soul,</HI> but he brings no Te&s;timony for it. He acknowledges that the little Trea|ti&s;e concerning the A&s;&s;umption of the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> among the Works of St. <HI>Jerom</HI> is none of that Father's Writings; and that the Homilies on this Fe&s;tival among the Works of St. <HI>Au|gu&s;tin</HI>
<PB N="51" REF="42"> are none of his. He de&s;troys, too, the pretended Te&s;timony of <HI>Denis</HI> the <HI>Areopagite,</HI> and &s;o leaves the Story rather confuted than confirm'd. <HI>Dupin (Nouvelle Bibliotheque)</HI> &s;peaks of that Treati&s;e among the Works of St. <HI>Jerome</HI> what is worth ob&s;erving here. <HI>The 10th Let|ter,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>on the A&s;&s;umption of the Virgin</HI> Ma|ry <HI>is written by &s;ome Latin Author who liv'd when the Ea&s;t was infected with the Errour of the</HI> Eutychians, <HI>(who would acknowledge but one Na|ture in Je&s;us Chri&s;t) as he ob&s;erves him&s;elf; and this was what came to pa&s;s long after the death of St.</HI> Jerom. <HI>He that wrote it,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>&s;et it out under the name of St.</HI> Jerome, <HI>that what he &s;ays of the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin might be the more valu|ed. And the better to colour the Cheat, he pre|tends to direct it to</HI> Paula <HI>and</HI> Eu&s;tochium <HI>(per|&s;ons to whom St.</HI> Jerome <HI>did truly write.) Al|tho' he enlarges upon the Commendations and Pre|rogatives of the Virgin, yet</HI> he &s;ays, it was not certain whether &s;he was ri&s;en from the Dead, and her Body carried up into Heaven or not. <HI>This Treati&s;e</HI> (&s;ays he further) <HI>tho' &s;uppo&s;ititious, was in&s;erted into the Office of the Church by</HI> Pau|lus Diaconus <HI>and</HI> Alcuinus <HI>in</HI> Charlemaign's <HI>time: And &s;ince that it has made up part of the Le&s;&s;ons for the Fea&s;t of the A&s;&s;umption in the Old Breviaries of</HI> France <HI>and</HI> Italy. Thus &s;peaks <HI>Dupin</HI> of this matter. But notwith&s;tanding the uncertainty of this Fact, the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> celebrates a Day to commemorate this to her Honour, which is the 15th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> and a Plenary Indulgence is granted to encourage the Devotions of this Solemnity in this Church; the form of the Publication of which in the Year 1696 was as follows.</P>

Are not here Di|vine Honours in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner paid to her, when all this is done for her Honour as well as for God's, and even that which done as is pretended for God's Honour? But let them know, that he who has &s;aid, <HI>Mine Ho|nour will I not give to another,</HI> will not reckon there is any paid to him when that which is due only to him is communicated to a Crea|ture: And we may ob&s;erve how undi&s;tinctly, at lea&s;t, they &s;peak to the People, and how ill they mu&s;t needs teach them when they &s;peak &s;o, in this; that they mention at la&s;t the mo&s;t Glorious Deity without any Epithet of Honour, but the Virgin is call'd mo&s;t Holy. Certainly if their Prayers for the extirpation of Here&s;ies, which are always excited on the&s;e occa&s;ions, had any effect, they would procure the removal of the&s;e gro&s;s Idolatries from the Chri&s;tian Church.</P>
<P>In the entrace of the Office for the Ma&s;s of this Day they &s;ay: <HI>Let us all rejoyce in the Lord and &s;olemnly celebrate this Day in Honour of the Ble&s;&s;ed</HI> Mary: <HI>For the A&s;&s;umption of whom the Angels rejoyce, and glorifie the Son of God.</HI> Mr. <HI>de Meaux</HI> produces a Collect for the Day which runs thus:
<Q><PB N="56" REF="45"><HI>O Lord, let us receive a Salutary A&s;&s;i&s;tance from the Solemnity of this Day, whereon the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin</HI> Mary, <HI>Mother of God, un|derwent a Temporal Death, but could not be held down by the Chains of that Death,</HI> &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>On the day of this Fe&s;tival, and &s;o through the whole <HI>Octave,</HI> one &s;hall &s;ee at this Church a number of Puppets dre&s;s'd up to repre&s;ent her, and hung by Wyres in a &s;trait Line one above another up to the top of the lo&s;ty Church, and the highe&s;t of them are the lea&s;t, to make the di&s;tance appear the greater; but they are all dre&s;s'd exactly alike. Thus are the People taught her A&s;&s;umption: but while they are thus taught by Images and Pictures, we cannot chu&s;e but think that it would be much better for them if they had more of the Scri|ptures, and le&s;s of the&s;e. This is one of the many In&s;tances of Devotion in the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, which, at lea&s;t, are groundle&s;s, and without any Foundation or Warrant in the Word of God. But if that which is done with|out Faith, as the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, be Sin; and that which has no Foundation or Warrant from the Word of God mu&s;t be done by con&s;e|quence without Faith; then 'tis nece&s;&s;ary that the&s;e Devotions, in&s;tead of being acceptable with God, mu&s;t be &s;inful, and an Abomination to him. But there is yet a further Guilt in this matter, and that is, That this with &s;everal Ho|nours and Devotions paid to the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> are de&s;ign'd, and tend to parallel her fir&s;t with our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, and then perhaps after|wards they will advance her above him (as in
<PB N="57" REF="45"> &s;ome things &s;ome of them &s;eem to do already) for the&s;e Evil Men and Seducers grow wor&s;e and wor&s;e. Therefore as the Chri&s;tian Church has ob&s;erv'd a Day, and &s;till does &s;o, to cele|brate our Saviour's miraculous Conception; the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> keeps a Day to celebrate hers, which the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Meaux</HI> expre&s;ly calls a miraculous Conception too. As the Chri&s;ti|an Church celebrates the Nativity of our Lord, &s;o the <HI>Roman</HI> Church celebrates on a particular Fe&s;tival that of the Virgin: As the Chri&s;tian Church celebrates the Pre&s;entation of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> in the Temple, as the Fir&s;t-born of his Mother, and a Male, &s;o the <HI>Roman</HI> Church ce|lebrates the Pre&s;entation of the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> at the Temple; having, as the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Meaux</HI> &s;ays, receiv'd it by a pious Tradition come from the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> That the ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Mary</HI> was con|&s;ecrated to God from her Infancy, and pre|&s;ented to him in the Temple. This Story was very ignorantly invented at fir&s;t: For the <HI>Jew|i&s;h</HI> Law ordain'd indeed, that the Males &s;hould be pre&s;ented to God, which were the Fir&s;t|born of their Mothers, but not the Females. This is very evident in the Scripture, and the Je&s;uit <HI>Menochius</HI> &s;tates the Law &s;o in his Learn|ed Book <HI>De Republica Hebraica.</HI> They comme|morate her Sufferings as well as tho&s;e of our Sa|viour, and frequently &s;how her to the People, as having a Sword &s;ticking in her Brea&s;t as &s;he &s;tands by the Cro&s;s of our Saviour; and &s;ome|times they expre&s;s their Reliance on her Suf|ferings for the Satisfaction of their Guilt, as they do of tho&s;e of our Saviour. To conclude, as the Church celebrates the Re&s;urrection and A&s;cen&s;ion of our Lord into Heaven, &s;o does
<PB N="58" REF="46"> the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> that of the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, whom by a parallel Title they u&s;ually call <HI>Our Lady.</HI> If all &s;hould be here produced which is practi&s;ed in the Veneration of the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> by the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and is allow'd and encourag'd by the publick Authority of the &s;ame, and taught by their Preachers and Wri|ters without Cen&s;ure, yea, with the expre&s;s Approbation of the Cen&s;urers; I doubt not but it would appear to any ju&s;t and impartial Per|&s;on to be no hard and unju&s;t Appellation, if one &s;hould call the People of that Communi|on rather <HI>Marians</HI> than <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI></P>

To the&s;e People are tied the Fraternity of the Cord of St. <HI>Francis,</HI> which enjoys great Spiri|tual Privileges of the Pope's granting.

<P>I &s;hall fir&s;t give an Account of the Fea&s;t of <HI>Portiuncula,</HI> as I have it from them&s;elves: In a &s;hort Relation of the Original, and mo&s;t Ple|nary Ingulgences of our Lady of the Angels, nam'd <HI>Portiuncula,</HI> granted the holy <HI>Francis</HI> by Chri&s;t him&s;elf; which is yearly to be obtain'd in the Churches of the Minor Brothers on the &s;econd of <HI>Augu&s;t:</HI> It is as follows.</P>
<P>At the di&s;tance of about a Mile from <HI>A&s;&s;i&s;e</HI> in <HI>Italy</HI> (where the holy <HI>Francis</HI> was born) there &s;tood an old, ruinous, little Chappel be|longing to a certain Abbey of St <HI>Benedict;</HI> to this place the holy <HI>Francis</HI> after his Conver&s;i|on bore a particular Devotion, and begun to repair the &s;ame after the be&s;t manner that he could, and to take it for his ordinary Habita|tion, chu&s;ing the &s;ame for the fir&s;t Settlement and beginning of his Seraphick Order, and call'd it <HI>Our Lady of the Angels;</HI> for that he had often in that place heard the wonderful &s;weet Hymns of the Angels of God, and had
<PB N="61" REF="47"> him&s;elf there oftentimes enjoy'd their Conver|&s;ation. He nam'd al&s;o this Chappel, <HI>Our Lady of</HI> Portiuncula; whether it were from a Vil|lage of that Name, near which this Chappel might be built, or for that he held this place for his little Portion, (in Latin <HI>Portiuncula)</HI> which God Almighty had allotted him for his Order. Altho' the Foundation at fir&s;t was ve|ry &s;mall, yet it is through the particular Di&s;|pen&s;ation of God greatly encreas'd, and be|come exceedingly renown'd through all Chri|&s;tendom. It was al&s;o held in &s;uch E&s;timation by St. <HI>Francis,</HI> that no man was permitted to come in there but his Brothers only; and of the &s;ame none might there dwell with him, but &s;uch as excell'd in good and exemplary li|ving.</P>
<P>This now was well enough thought on in a Story &s;o &s;illy as this will appear; becau&s;e un|der this pretence they can put upon the World what Lyes they plea&s;e concerning St. <HI>Francis</HI>'s Miracles and miraculous Entertainments here; as it is the common Character of their feign'd Miracles by which they pretend to confirm and recommend their Fopperies, and Super&s;titions, and Idolatries, that they are always done in a Corner, and hid from the World, there are none of them that ever appear'd in publick, or in any great Concour&s;e of People, or to any impar|tial Witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>But to go on with my Tale: It came to pa&s;s (they &s;ay) in the Year 1221. about the Month of <HI>October,</HI> as the holy <HI>Francis</HI> was in his Cell very zealou&s;ly and heartily praying to God for Sinners, an Angel appear'd to him, who &s;aid, That <HI>he mu&s;t go immediately into the Church, be|cau&s;e
<PB N="62" REF="48"> that our Saviour and his mo&s;t Holy Mother, with an innumerable Multitude of Angels were waiting for him.</HI> (It was really very conde|&s;cendingly done for this great Company to come fir&s;t and wait for him; or rather mo&s;t impudently was the Story thus devis'd; but this Honour which they give St. <HI>Francis,</HI> is little to what the <HI>Alcoran</HI> of the <HI>Minorites</HI> a&s;cribes to him; I mean the great Book I have &s;een of the Conformities of St. <HI>Francis</HI> with Je&s;us Chri&s;t.) Upon this St. <HI>Francis</HI> went into the Church, and &s;aw there the Lord Chri&s;t, on who&s;e Right-hand &s;tood his Ble&s;&s;ed Mother en|compa&s;s'd with an innumerable Company of Angels: Whereupon he fell flat on his Face to the Earth, and continued there his devout Prayers to the Lord and his Mother: (Was this an Exerci&s;e of Devotion in St. <HI>Francis</HI> to pray to the Virgin together with Chri&s;t, or done only with the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Meaux</HI>'s Spirit of Charity?) But the Lord Je&s;us &s;aid to him, <HI>Francis, you and your Brothers</HI> (precious Men) <HI>are extreamly &s;olicitous for the Salvation of Men; &s;eek therefore of me for the Salvation of the People, for the Comfort of Souls, and for ad|vancing the Honour of my Name, all that which you de&s;ire, and it &s;hall undoubtedly be granted you.</HI></P>
<P>St. <HI>Francis</HI> lay &s;tretch'd out before the Face of God altogether tran&s;ported in Spirit; but being come a little to him&s;elf, and being &s;trengthned in the inner Man, he took Cou|rage, and &s;aid; <HI>O mo&s;t Holy Father!

<P>The Brothers, who were Twelve in number, (which is doubtle&s;s one of the Conformities of St. <HI>Francis</HI> with Je&s;us Chri&s;t) and who dwelt with St. <HI>Francis</HI> in this place, and were all of them in their Cells, &s;aw a mighty Glory in the Church, and around it multitudes of Angels; they heard al&s;o very di&s;tinctly all that pa&s;&s;ed, but through Fear and A&s;toni&s;hment dur&s;t not venture into the Church, nor indeed &s;tir from their Cells.</P>
<P>The day following, St. <HI>Francis</HI> with one of his Brothers, travell'd to <HI>Peru&s;ia,</HI> where the Pope <HI>Honorius</HI> the Third held his Court, and being admitted to him, he humbly &s;aid, <HI>Mo&s;t holy Father, I have, not long &s;ince, repair'd a Church to the Honour of the holy Mother of God; whereupon I intreat that your Holine&s;s would be</HI>
<PB N="64" REF="49"> <HI>pleas'd to grant, that a plenary and free Indulgence &s;hould therein be obtain'd without Offerings.</HI> The Pope &s;aid, <HI>Such a thing as that could not be; fora&s;much as whoever will enjoy an Indulgence, they mu&s;t by all means merit or obtain this by gi|ving at lea&s;t &s;ome Alms.</HI> (This is well &s;aid, and and opens all the Trick and Cheat of Indul|gences.)</P>
<P>The Pope asked further, How many Years he de&s;ir'd this Indulgence &s;hould extend to? St. <HI>Francis</HI> an&s;wer'd, <HI>I intreat that your Holine&s;s will be pleas'd to grant, That all they who with Penitence come into this Church, and confe&s;s them|&s;elves, and have receiv'd Ab&s;olution, may be ab&s;olv'd both in Heaven and Earth from all Guilt and Puni&s;hment from the time of their Bapti&s;m to the time that they come into this Church.</HI> As the Pope made a Difficulty to grant this, St. <HI>Fran|cis</HI> &s;aid, <HI>My Lord, I &s;eek this Indulgence not of my &s;elf, but in the Name of Chri&s;t who hath &s;ent me.</HI> Then did the Pope give his Con&s;ent, but through the In&s;tigation of &s;ome Cardinals, he order'd that this Indulgence &s;hould indeed be continued for ever, but that it &s;hould not be obtain'd on more than one day in a Year. Up|on which, St. <HI>Francis,</HI> with great Reverence, taking his leave, the Pope call'd to him, and &s;aid, <HI>Well Brother Simplicity, and what Secu|rity have you now for your Indulgence?</HI> St. <HI>Fran|cis</HI> &s;aid, <HI>My Lord, your Word is enough for me, for God &s;hall further his own Work, and I de&s;ire no other Bull; for our good Lady &s;hall be the Paper, Chri&s;t the Notary, and the Angels the Witne&s;&s;es:</HI> (And doubtle&s;s it was very proper that all the&s;e &s;hould be thus concern'd about &s;o precious and important a matter.)</P>
<PB N="65" REF="49">
<P>And this matter was very wi&s;ely manag'd all this while, or at lea&s;t very &s;illily devis'd; for they go on and &s;ay, It was now two Years that St. <HI>Francis</HI> had obtain'd this divine Indulgence, but there was yet no day &s;ettled whereon the World &s;hould obtain it.

<P>As St. <HI>Francis</HI> at Midnight was praying in his Cell, the Enemy came to him with the pre|tence of Friend&s;hip, &s;aying, <HI>Francis, wherefore will you de&s;tory your &s;elf before your time?

<P>Many &s;illy and riculous Circum&s;tances more are mention'd in the Story; but to be &s;hort: He went to the Pope, &s;how'd his fine flouri&s;h|ing Ro&s;es in Winter, and by Virtue of them obtain'd this Indulgence, as the particular Or|der

<P>To the&s;e Monks belongs the Fraternity of the Cord of St. <HI>Francis,</HI> by Virtue of which many of the People are joyn'd to them, coming to publick Wor&s;hip con&s;tantly in their Meeting-Places, and receiving all Admini&s;trations of the Divine Ordinances from them. I &s;hall give &s;ome Account of this from what them|&s;elves &s;ay of it in a Book written to recom|mend
<PB N="69" REF="51"> it to the People, call'd <HI>The little Spiritual Wine-pre&s;s;</HI> or a &s;hort Account of the Original, Worthine&s;s, Miracles, Conditions, Priviledges, Fruits, Indulgences of the far renowned Arch|brotherhood of the holy Five Wounds and Suf|ferings of Chri&s;t, nam'd <HI>the Cord of St.</HI> Francis. It is pretended indeed, that this Fraternity is &s;et up to honour and commemorate the Suffer|ings of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; but we &s;hall find by un|der&s;tanding it, that 'tis rather de&s;ign'd to ho|nour St. <HI>Francis,</HI> and to maintain the&s;e his Brothers. To &s;how how acceptable to God the Remembrance of Chri&s;t's Sufferings is, they tell this Story of St. <HI>Francis:</HI> He had, they &s;ay, &s;uch Compa&s;&s;ion and Devotion to the bitter Sufferings of Chri&s;t, that he would often bur&s;t out with Tears, and cry and moan mo&s;t bit|terly, as if Men were putting him to the great|e&s;t Torment: Therefore Chri&s;t al&s;o honour'd him with the Marks of his holy Five Wounds, to renew in the World the Remembrance of his Benefits and Love &s;hown to us in his bitter Sufferings (So the World is to remember the Sufferings of Chri&s;t by the Wounds of St. <HI>Fran|cis;</HI> and I doubt not 'tis one Conformity of the pretended Saint to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that Men mu&s;t expect to be &s;av'd by the Merits of his Wounds too.) They &s;ay, that St. <HI>Francis</HI> hear|ing that Scripture read, <HI>Provide neither Gold, nor Silver, nor Bra&s;s in your Pur&s;es, nor Scrip for your Journey, neither Shoes;</HI> he immediately threw off his Shoes, di&s;po&s;ed of the little Mo|ney he had, and his Pur&s;e too; and laid a&s;ide his Girdle, and in&s;tead of it, girt him&s;elf with a Cord. But certainly, if this Scripture is to be taken in the &s;trict literal Sence for a common
<PB N="70" REF="52"> Rule, St. <HI>Francis</HI> &s;hould have let alone the Cord, and not have girt him&s;elf at all, for even the Cord might be reckon'd a Girdle. But for all that, they tell us, that through this Cord Almighty God has done many wonderful Works; &s;o that not only the Cord, but al&s;o the Water in which the Cord had been wa&s;h'd, would heal Di&s;ea|&s;es; which &s;ignifies in what great E&s;teem men ought to hold this Cord. But is it po&s;&s;ible for any man &s;eriou&s;ly to think it worth while for the Infinite Wi&s;dom and Power to alter the Cour&s;e of Nature, and work. Miracles for the Honour of this Cord? Certainly nothing can be more impious and bla&s;phemous, than the a&s;cribing to the great Sovereign, and Author of the World, the working Miracles on &s;o trifling Occa&s;ions, as they many times find for them, in the Hi&s;tories of their Saints; which is as if the Divine Power, like a paultry Jugler, would &s;how Tricks for the &s;ake of &s;howing them. To go on:</P>
<P>Pope <HI>Leo</HI> X. granted to the Order of the Mi|nor Brothers the Power to admini&s;ter the Cord to all Chri&s;tian People, with great Indulgences and Priviledges. Many Great and Noble Per|&s;ons have born this Cord openly, namely, 4 Popes, 48 Cardinals, 2 Emperors, 12 Kings, many other Noble, and a multitude of meaner People. <HI>Sixtus</HI> the Fifth Pope of <HI>Rome,</HI> through his pious and religious Charity, e&s;tabli&s;h'd in the Year 1586. this Archbrotherhood of the Cord of <HI>A&s;&s;i&s;e</HI> for the purpo&s;es following.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, to renew the remembrance of the Sufferings of Chri&s;t, as is pretended, but it might have been let alone for all this, becau&s;e Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf has left us a fit and &s;ufficient
<PB N="71" REF="52"> memorial of them in the Sacrament of his Supper.</P>
<P>2. He having ob&s;erv'd how great Devotion many People bore to the H. <HI>Francis,</HI> who yet had no opportunity to for&s;ake the World and live under the direction of any of his 3 Holy Rules; he therefore in&s;tituted this Brother|hood that they might at lea&s;t in the wearing of this Cord become the followers of St. <HI>Francis,</HI> be excited to all Virtue, and might live and die in the love of God.</P>
<P>3. And al&s;o, that all faithful People, through the whole World, who afford daily Su&s;tenance and Food to the minor Brothers, may from the &s;ame Religious receive Spiritual Gifts and A&s;&s;i|&s;tances. And this without doubt is the chief rea&s;on for this wi&s;e In&s;titution; to encourage and oblige an ea&s;ie and abus'd Devotion to contribute real Benefits for the empty return of Imaginary ones.</P>
<P>Further to recommend this Brotherhood, or wheedle, the People are told, that among o|ther Privileges granted by God him&s;elf to the H. Father <HI>Francis,</HI> this is one; That he &s;hould relea&s;e every Year upon the day of his Fe&s;tival all the Souls of tho&s;e of his three Orders, and the Souls of tho&s;e who have been Benefactors to them from the di&s;mal Fire of Purgatory.</P>
<P>The mighty Privileges and Benefits belong|ing to this Fraternity are too many to be here enumerated, but I &s;hall mention &s;ome of them.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that enter them&s;elves herein &s;hall en|joy all the Indulgences and Favours granted to the minor Brothers. They &s;hall be partakers of the merits of all the Fa&s;ts, Prayers, Watch|ings, and other good Works which are done

<P>They &s;hall receive Plenary Indulgence upon the day of their coming into the Brotherhood once, and at the day of their Death: Upon all the Fea&s;t-days of our Saviour, and upon all the Fe&s;tivals of our good Lady; upon St. <HI>Fran|cis</HI>'s day; All-Saints-day; and through the whole good Week before <HI>Ea&s;ter:</HI> This is grant|ed by <HI>Leo</HI> the 10th.</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> That the Brothers and Si&s;ters of the Archbrotherhood ought to &s;eek of their Father Con&s;e&s;&s;or, who mu&s;t al&s;o be a Minorite, the&s;e great Indulgences and Ab&s;olutions.</P>

<P>Plenary Indulgence for all tho&s;e who at their Death de&s;ire out of Devotion, to be buri|ed in the Habit of the minor Brothers being Men, or if Women in that of the Clari&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Plenary Indulgence for the Parents who have Children in the Order of the minor Bro|thers, being in the &s;tate of Grace, and that for &s;o many times as they have Sons in that Or|der; which Indulgence the Children may ap|ply to their Parents when dead, by &s;aying a Ma&s;s near their Graves: (To this purpo&s;e they will be induced to order them&s;elves to be buri|ed in their Churches, and without doubt good Pre&s;ents and Legacies are u&s;ually made to the&s;e good Brothers, both for the Habit, and for the Burying-place.)</P>
<P>A multitude of Lying Wonders are produc'd to recommend this ble&s;&s;ed Cord (which the In|ventors of them de&s;erve to have about their Necks for their pains) I &s;hall only tell one Story which is a little diverting though it has e|nough the Air of Fal&s;hood and Folly: For by this wondrous Cord a Saint of the Order chea|ted the grand Deceiver, and made a meer A&s;s of the Devil: O fine! the truth on't is, the
<PB N="74" REF="54"> old Fellow does &s;o often cheat us all that one would be plea&s;ed to under&s;tand that He &s;hould ever be put upon him&s;elf: The Story runs thus. The good Father <HI>Martinus Ruis</HI> not being able to pa&s;s the River <HI>Guadarrama,</HI> as he &s;tood care|ful upon the Brink about the matter, there comes down to the Water near him an A&s;s: The good Man knew by an In&s;piration that this was the Devil, and that he rogui&s;hly in|tended, if the good Man &s;hould offer to mount him, to carry him into the mid&s;t of the River, and there throw him off and drown him; ne|verthele&s;s he goes to the A&s;s, nimbly &s;lips the Cord of St. <HI>Francis</HI> about his Neck, and then he had him &s;ecure, and a mighty thing I a&s;|&s;ure you it was, that a Man could make any good of the Devil; yet he did, for he mount|ed, and the Devil carried him &s;afely through the River, he kept him in &s;ervitude &s;till, rid him to <HI>Toledo,</HI> forced him to drudge there in carrying Stones and heavy Burdens to &s;erve the Repair of the Cloi&s;ter. ('Tis well we have it once acknowldg'd, that the Devil was &s;erviceable to the erecting of any of tho&s;e pre|tended Religious Hou&s;es.) But the good Man gave a Charge that no one &s;hould ever take off this Cord, and &s;o the poor Devil wore it, and continued in the &s;hape and &s;lavery of an A&s;s many Years. At length as he &s;tood bound to a Crib, while two Fathers of the Order look'd on, who were &s;trangers to this Convent and to the Matter, he made &s;hew to them of en|tangling him&s;elf with his Cord, and to be in danger of being &s;trangled by it; upon which the good Fathers ran to relieve him, and &s;lipt the Cord off from him. That was it the De|vil
<PB N="75" REF="54"> wanted, and away he vani&s;h'd immediately with loud outcries and howlings, and left a mo&s;t fearful &s;tink behind him. And &s;o much for that.</P>
<P>Let us ob&s;erve in the la&s;t place &s;ome of the Rules and Con&s;titutions of the Brotherhood. Every one that will become a Brother mu&s;t en|ter his Name in the Book of the Archbrother|hood. They mu&s;t receive the Cord, being ble&s;&s;ed, from the Hands of a Superiour of the minor Brothers; mu&s;t gird them&s;elves daily with the &s;ame, wearing it either above or un|der their Cloaths: They may put it off at Night going to Bed, and put it on again in the Morning when they ri&s;e. If the Cord be lo&s;t or when 'tis worn out they may ask for ano|ther con&s;ecrated one, or provide it them&s;elves, and carry it to be ble&s;t. They mu&s;t read com|monly every Day 5 <HI>Pater No&s;ters</HI> and 5 <HI>Ave Maries</HI> with the 5 Salutations of the 5 Wounds to the Honour of the 5 Wounds of our Sa|viour.</P>
<P>All the Brothers mu&s;t come to a Monthly A&s;&s;embly at &s;ome time and place convenient: At which time one of the&s;e Fathers &s;hall make an Exhortation to them. (Without doubt to be true to the Cord, that they may go to Hea|ven in a String, and he will tell them many a fine &s;tory of the Virtues of the Cord.) The De|votions in the&s;e A&s;&s;emblies are to begin with (the Ancient and Venerable) Hymn <HI>Veni Crea|tor</HI> (which is worthy of a much better Office;) and mu&s;t end with the Litany of St. <HI>Francis</HI> or of our good Lady. A number of the Brothers call'd out by the Servant of the Brotherhood &s;hall honour with a Light the H. Sacrament of
<PB N="76" REF="55"> the Altar in the monthly Proce&s;&s;ion, as al&s;o in the Proce&s;&s;ion of <HI>Portiuncula,</HI> &amp;c. to which end a number of Flambeau's or Wax-Candles &s;hall be kept, to which the Brothers &s;hall be pleas'd to contribute. As any one of the Brothers comes to be &s;ick the Father &s;hall be told of it, who &s;hall take care that he be provided of the Holy Sacrament, and be vi&s;ited by other Bro|thers according to Quality and Opportunity: And the Servant of the Brotherhood &s;hall de|&s;ire all the Brothers in the Town, or that in|habit near it, to attend the Sacrament to the &s;ick per&s;on and honour it with the Flambeau's of the Brotherhood. When any Brother dies, Brothers are to be invited to attend the Fune|ral; the Ma&s;s of <HI>Requiem</HI> &s;hall according to order be &s;ung in the Convent to which all Brothers &s;hall be invited, as al&s;o the &s;ame Ma&s;s &s;hall be &s;aid in the <HI>Octave</HI> of St. <HI>Francis</HI> for all tho&s;e who are departed of this Frater|nity.</P>
<P>When they put on the Cord in the Morning they are to &s;ay this Prayer following;
<Q>Vouch&s;afe, O Lord, to gird me with the Girdle of Purity, that the Virtue of Cha&s;tity may al|ways abide in me, and I may wear this Pe|nitential Cord for the forgivene&s;s of my Sins, through the Merit of the Cords and Suffe|rings of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>And what need is there I wonder of wearing this Cord in order to obtain the forgivene&s;s of Sin by the Sufferings of Je&s;us Chri&s;t? Will it be &s;aid, the Merit of the&s;e are not &s;ufficient unle&s;s a Man do hereby apply or tie to him&s;elf the
<PB N="77" REF="55"> Merits of St. <HI>Francis</HI> and his Order? And is it not plain they reckon this addition at lea&s;t ve|ry u&s;eful, and &s;o rely upon the Merits of this pretended Saint as well as upon tho&s;e of Chri&s;t; and give him a part in this Honour of a Media|tor. But to crown all, let us ob&s;erve the Pray|er and Prote&s;tation which they mu&s;t u&s;e at the entring them&s;elves into this Brotherhood, which is as follows:
<Q>I N. N. <HI>take for my particular Mediation with Almighty God, the mo&s;t Holy Maid and Mother of God</HI> Mary; <HI>the H. Father</HI> Fran|ci&s;cus, <HI>with all the Saints of his Order; the which I &s;hall never for&s;ake, and again&s;t the Honour of whom I &s;hall never do any thing, nor will I &s;uffer that any under my Authori|ty &s;hall by my con&s;ent or connivance do any &s;uch thing. In all things I re&s;ign my &s;elf to the Obedience of the Holy</HI> Roman <HI>Church. I be&s;eech you then, O mo&s;t H. Maid and Mo|ther</HI> Mary, <HI>and you, O Holy Father</HI> Fran|cis, <HI>with your holy Company, that you will be plea&s;ed to receive me for your</HI> Servant, <HI>and</HI> &s;tand by me in all my Works and Ne|ce&s;&s;ities, <HI>that I may follow your good Exam|ples, and, through a &s;aving Death, may be partaker with you of everla&s;ting Glory.</HI></Q></P>
<P>And will not this &s;olemn Prote&s;tation and Prayer allow'd in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and encourag'd by Popes and Indulgencies go for an Addre&s;s to the Saints for their immediate help when the B. Virgin and <HI>Francis</HI> are de&s;ir'd to &s;tand by them? Is it only the Spirit of Cha|rity that makes them devote them&s;elves thus to
<PB N="78" REF="56"> the&s;e per&s;ons in po&s;tures and forms of Wor&s;hip, and to &s;ay to them, <HI>Receive me for your Ser|vant?</HI> And when in this Form there is no men|tion at all of the Mediation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, but a choice is made of others by Name for this purpo&s;e, and a Prote&s;tation &s;olemnly pronoun|ced of relying and tru&s;ting to their Mediation, may we not &s;u&s;pect that of our Saviour is for|gotten for the pre&s;ent? However do they not herein advance the&s;e Saints to the Honour of Mediators together with him at lea&s;t, when they &s;ometimes betake them&s;elves to their Me|diation without Him? If one would interpret this practice to the wor&s;t Sence it can bear, it might be &s;aid they herein preferr the&s;e Saints before our mo&s;t Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, and chu&s;e the&s;e for their peculiar and chief Mediators, or in&s;tead of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. But I would wrong no body, and would exerci&s;e Charity to all men, therefore I would not impute this to them.</P>
<P>The&s;e good Fathers, the Brethren and Fol|lower<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the pretended St. <HI>Francis,</HI> are as hath been &s;aid, great &s;ticklers for the immaculate Conception of the B.

It was, I think, the time of <HI>Compline,</HI> as they call it, which is the la&s;t Office of the Day. They commonly begin and end this Service on Fe&s;tival-times, as this was, with the Bene|diction of the Holy Sacrament, which is thus perform'd: The Prie&s;t brings it out in a rich <NOTE PLACE="marg">Benedicti|on.</NOTE> Remon&s;tranter at the beginning, and very gravely holding it before him, turns him&s;elf a little &s;ucce&s;&s;ively towards both &s;ides of the Chappel, and &s;o &s;hews it to the People who all pro&s;trate them&s;elves and adore it: This done, he &s;ets it up in a place fitted for it on the Altar; and when the Office is done, this formality is repeated again: This they call the <HI>Benediction,</HI> and tho&s;e who cannot be pre&s;ent at the whole Service will &s;ometimes make great ha&s;te to &s;ecure the Felicity of the Benediction
<PB N="83" REF="58"> at the end, which they are warn'd of by a Bell, as I now ob&s;erv'd. We &s;aw now the Church-Yard, which is not a &s;mall one, full of Coaches, and the large Church throng'd with People. And three of their Prie&s;ts were at the High Altar in very rich Copes which &s;eem'd at a di&s;tance to be Cloth of Silver, with a great deal of Embroidery upon them in Gold and Silver: But, as is u&s;ual with Copes, this Embroidery was &s;ome of it perhaps laid on in the form of a Cro&s;s which reaches from the top to the bottom, and from one &s;ide to the other of the Cope behind, for the&s;e good Men are proud of bearing the Cro&s;s after Chri&s;t. I fancy &s;uch a Cro&s;s as this would not be ei|ther to the <HI>Jews</HI> a &s;tumbling Block or to the <HI>Greeks</HI> Fooli&s;hne&s;s, tho' the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t was &s;o: This is their Cro&s;s indeed, and in hot weather &s;omewhat a heavy one, alas, but little a-kin after all to the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>The&s;e People have here on the North &s;ide of the Quire a pretty clo&s;e Chappel dedicated to the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> the Floor, the Walls, and the Arch'd Roof are all Marble, the Floor black and white, and the re&s;t white. On the Wall, upon the Right-hand as one goes in, there are two pieces of very curious carv'd Work in two Pannels, as I may &s;peak, of the Marble; the one is a Pro&s;pect of the City of <HI>Antwerp:</HI> The other is an Army rang'd in its feveral Battalions of Hor&s;e and Foot, where ones &s;ees the Men and the Hor&s;es of the &s;eve|ral Bodies di&s;tinctly cut. In this Chappel over the Altar there &s;tands an Image of the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> crown'd, as tall I believe as a Child of two Years old, with a Child in her Arms, and
<PB N="84" REF="59"> the&s;e &s;eem'd, and the Monk told us, they are Ma&s;&s;y Silver. They &s;hew too a &s;mall Effigies of a Man in a Coffin with the <HI>Scapular</HI> on, to be &s;ure, in which it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed he died and was buried that he might a&s;&s;uredly be &s;av'd. This is &s;aid to be the Man who erected this Chappel, he was as I rember a rich Merchant of <HI>Antwerp.</HI></P>
<P>But let us return to the Indulgences &s;o often <NOTE PLACE="marg">Indulgen|ces.</NOTE> mention'd, which the poor People &s;o eagerly run after, and con&s;ider them a little upon this Occa&s;ion once for all, that we may under&s;tand the Rea&s;on, and U&s;e, and the Cheat of them. Indulgences are the great Manufacture, as we may &s;ay, of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, that which &s;upports their Trade and brings in their Wealth. That which gathers, and binds together the Fraternities who at their charge erect, beauti|fie and maintain &s;ome Altars and Chappels, and the wor&s;hip of &s;ome particular Saints, is that &s;everal Indulgences are granted to that Fraternity to be obtain'd at tho&s;e Altars and Chappels. That which draws the multitude to Church, to be pre&s;ent at a Ma&s;s, and other Devotions on their numerous Holidays is the grant of Indulgences to be obtain'd there at tho&s;e times. When any Church or Chappel wants repairing, begins to be de&s;erted, or wants more Finery and Riches, new Indulgences are grant|ed to tho&s;e that &s;hall come to Ma&s;s at that Al|tar or Chappel. When the Pope has a mind to favour any knot of Secular Prie&s;ts, or any Religious Order, he grants them &s;ome new In|dulgences to be obtain'd by tho&s;e who &s;hall come to hear them &s;ay Ma&s;s at certain appoint|ed times at their Churches or Chappels. But
<PB N="85" REF="59"> whatever other Preparation they have or want, in order to partake of the&s;e Benefits, they mu&s;t not think to do it without an Of|fering. So the Indulgences bring People, the Peo|ple bring Money, and Money an&s;wers all things with them. This is the real U&s;e and De&s;ign of the&s;e things; they are very profit|able to the Prie&s;ts, but let us &s;ee what an Ad|vantage they are pretended to be to the Peo|ple, and how groundle&s;s and fal&s;e that Pre|tence is, and how the real Cheat of all may be di&s;cover'd.</P>
<P>We &s;hall &s;trictly follow the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Meaux</HI> in taking an Account of the Doctrine of Indul|gences, who&s;e Expo&s;itions are become Oracles in the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> He puts his Account of their Doctrine of Satisfaction for Sin, and of Purgatory, and of Indulgences together: And indeed they are all, as well as they can be, joyn'd together in the Doctrine of that Church. The Catholicks, (&s;aies he, meaning the Church of <HI>Rome)</HI> do with one Con&s;ent teach, That Je&s;us Chri&s;t alone, God and Man, was capable by the infinite Dignity of his Per|&s;on, to offer to God a Satisfaction &s;ufficient for our Sins. But he having &s;uperabundantly &s;ati&s;|fied, could apply that his infinite Satisfaction to us in the&s;e two different manners: Either he could give us an entire Di&s;charge, without the Re&s;erve of any Pain or Penalty to be &s;uffered by our &s;elves; Or el&s;e he could e&s;tabli&s;h a Commutation of a greater Pain for a le&s;&s;er: That is to &s;ay, He could excu&s;e us from the E|ternal Pain due to our Sins, and leave us bound to &s;ome Temporal Pains; and this is that which he has done, with relation to tho&s;e who fall
<PB N="86" REF="60"> into Sin after their Bapti&s;m. They mu&s;t &s;uf|fer &s;ome Temporal Pain, tho&punc; the Eternal be remitted to them. And it is not to be conclu|ded thence (&s;aies he) that Je&s;us Chri&s;t has not entirely &s;atisfied for us, but on the contrary, that he having acquir'd an ab&s;olute Right or Propreity over us, by the infinite Price he has given for our Salvation, he gran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s us our Par|don upon &s;uch a Condition, or &s;uch a Law, and with &s;uch a Re&s;erve as he plea&s;es. It is there|fore to &s;atisfie this Obligation that we are &s;ub|ject to &s;ome Penalty which we ought to ac|compli&s;h in the Spirit of Humility and Repen|tance. And it was the nece&s;&s;ity of the&s;e &s;ati&s;|factory Works which oblig'd the Ancient Church to impo&s;e upon Penitents the Penalties which are call'd Canonical. When therefore the Church impo&s;es upon Sinners the Works that are penal and laborious, and it is &s;o that they &s;ubmit to them with Humility, this is cal|led Satisfaction; and when, having regard to the Fervour of the Penitents, or to other good Works which &s;he has pre&s;crib'd to them, &s;he relaxes &s;ome part of the Pain that was due, this is call'd Indulgence. Tho&s;e that go out of this Life with Grace and Charity, but are ne|verthele&s;s &s;till indebted for &s;ome Pains which the divine Ju&s;tice has re&s;erv'd, mu&s;t &s;uffer them in another Life, that is in Purgatory. This Pur|gatory <NOTE PLACE="marg">Purgatory</NOTE> they make as frightful as they can de|vi&s;e to do: they &s;ay the Pains are the &s;ame with tho&s;e in Hell: they &s;et the place of it, as it were, on the Suburbs of Hell, and repre&s;ent it as incomparably more intollerable than all that can be endur'd in this World: in&s;omuch that if we might believe the Stories which they
<PB N="87" REF="60"> have of the Apparitions and Complaints of Souls tortur'd there, it were more eligible and better to be endur'd, to live quite through an ordinary Life on Earth under the mo&s;t wrack|ing and tormenting Di&s;ea&s;e, than to lie but for a day in Purgatory. But the&s;e mi&s;erable Wretches who are there, have this Relief, as the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Meaux</HI> &s;ays, That God has &s;o e|&s;tabli&s;h'd the Advantages of brotherly Charity, and the Communion of Saints, that oftentimes he receives the Satisfactions which we offer for one another. So the Souls in Purgatory they pretend, may be reliev'd, and either ea&s;ed there, or deliver'd from thence by the Satisfactions of their Friends, for them, who are living on Earth. The&s;e Satisfactions their living Friends mu&s;t give for them, either by doing &s;ome la|borious Works, or by &s;uffering many hard and voluntary Penances them&s;elves; or el&s;e they mu&s;t purcha&s;e a good parcel of Satisfactions for them out of the Trea&s;ury of the Church, which the Pope at <HI>Rome,</HI> and the Bi&s;hops in their re|&s;pective Dioce&s;&s;es, have, as they pretend, the Power to di&s;pence, and to communicate or ap|ply them to whom they plea&s;e. This Trea&s;ure of the Church, as they pretend, is made up of the infinite Satisfactions of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the Satisfactions of the Saints. The Bi&s;hop of <HI>Meaux</HI> &s;ays, He mentions tho&s;e of the Saints, becau&s;e the Goodne&s;s of God is &s;uch, that he is willing, out of Favour to the more pious of his Servants, to &s;uffer him&s;elf to be, for their &s;akes, the more gentle, and ea&s;ie to others. This, &s;aies he, is the Foundation of Indulgen|ces. They are e&s;tabli&s;h'd to relax the Rigour of the temporal Pains due to &s;in. They are not
<PB N="88" REF="61"> de&s;ign'd, he &s;ays, to di&s;charge us from the Ob|ligations we lie under to &s;atisfie God our &s;elves, but becau&s;e we have always Rea&s;on to fear that we are far from having &s;atisfied occording to our Obligations, we &s;hould be Enemies to our &s;elves, if we &s;hould not have recour&s;e to the Favours and Indulgences of the Church; which are de&s;ign'd to aid tho&s;e who have a good Will, and do endeavour to &s;atisfie for them|&s;elves, to quit their Score, and to &s;upply their Infirmities. Now the&s;e Satisfactions of the Saints, which make up the Fund of Indulgen|ces, and the Trea&s;ure of the Church are rec|kon'd to be increas'd to a mighty Sum and Heap, tho' an invi&s;ible one, by any Works, e&s;pecially of Supererogation. And &s;o the vows of the Religious Orders, of Poverty, Cha&s;tity, and Obedience to &s;uch and &s;uch au&s;tere Rules of living, are things accounted mightily merito|rious. And then, if the Trea&s;ure of the Church be mightily furni&s;h'd from the meritorious and &s;atisfactory Fopperies of the Religious Orders, it is but rea&s;onable that the Pope &s;hould grant Indulgences, that is, Communications of the&s;e Merits and Satisfactions to be obtain'd at their Altars and Chappels. But methinks, too, it &s;eems not a little hard, or perhaps unju&s;t, that every Order &s;hould not have the keeping and di&s;pen&s;ing of their own Merits and Satisfa|ctions, that they mu&s;t depend upon the Pope for the Di&s;po&s;al of what is their own, or work to enlarge his Trea&s;ure, and have none of their own to di&s;po&s;e of, without his leave: <HI>Sic vos non vobis fertis aratra boves.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;hall ob&s;erve in the following Relation, that the Extent or Duration of the Indulgen|ces
<PB N="89" REF="61"> granted to &s;everal Performances, is very dif|ferent; &s;ome being granted for a certain num|ber of Days, more or le&s;s; &s;ome again are cal|led <HI>Plenary Indulgences;</HI> the Explication of this matter I &s;hall give here once for all in their own Words: <Q>Through an Indulgence of forty days, &s;ay they, men obtain the Forgivene&s;s of the Penalty due for their Sins, all at once, as if they had truly done the Penance of forty days, according to the ancient U&s;age of the holy Church. An Indulgence for a Year is a Forgivene&s;s of Penalty &s;o great as a Man could merit by doing penance for a whole Year. A Plenary Indulgence is the Forgive|ne&s;s of all Penalty that a Man owes for his Sins: &s;o that he who hath obtain'd a Plenary Indulgence, if it were &s;o that he &s;hould im|mediately die before he fall again into Sin, he &s;hould go &s;traight to Heaven, without being oblig'd to &s;uffer in the Fire of <HI>Purgatory.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Let us now ob&s;erve how the Cheat of all this may be di&s;cern'd, and upon a little Exa|mination of the matter we &s;hall find that this whole Frame of Stuff is a politick Engine to keep the People in Awe and Subjection to the Pope, and to hold the &s;everal numerous Or|ders, or rather Regiments of &s;uperfluous Prie&s;ts in good pay, and to pay them too with other Peoples Money. In the fir&s;t place we may ob&s;erve, 'tis well known to tho&s;e who are ac|quainted with the Hi&s;tory and Di&s;cipline of the primitive Church; that they did indeed injoyn publick Penance for tho&s;e who were guilty of publick and notorious Crimes, which they ob|lig'd them to endure and fulfil before they would admit them, after &s;uch Faults, to par|take
<PB N="90" REF="62"> of the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper. But the&s;e Penances were not de&s;ign'd to &s;atisfy the divine Ju&s;tice for the Sins committed, but to give the Church and the Publick, Satisfa|faction and evident Proof of the Sincerity and Truth of their Repentance. And when the time of the&s;e Penances was &s;hortned, which was the u&s;ual Indulgence of the Primitive Church, it was becau&s;e the Circum&s;tances &s;a|tisfied the Church before the time appointed was all &s;pent, that the Penitent was truly &s;uch, and was come to a due Sen&s;e and Dete&s;tation of his Fault: Or el&s;e it was &s;hortned becau&s;e the Per&s;on was likely to die within the time prefixed. In which ca&s;e al&s;o he having con|tinued his Task of Pennance, was, at the point of Death, admitted to partake of that Sacra|ment for his Con&s;olation and Support in that &s;ad Hour. Thus was the matter managed in the primitive Church.</P>
<P>And 'tis well known al&s;o by tho&s;e who are acquainted with the State and Management of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church at pre&s;ent, that tho&s;e good Men who would revive the ancient Di&s;ci|pline, and do require the Evidences of a true Repentance before they admit People to that Sacrament, are hated and per&s;ecuted by the prevailing Faction in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> un|der the Dominion of the Je&s;uits; and revil'd and reproach'd with the Names of <HI>Jan&s;eni&s;ts, Arnaldi&s;ts, Novators, Rigouri&s;ts,</HI> and <HI>Hereticks.</HI> Among others who be&s;tow upon them the&s;e hated Names, the famous Traveller <HI>Hen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">epin,</HI> who&s;e Brains were bewildred in the Wilder|ne&s;&s;es of <HI>America;</HI> if he ever had any, has en|deavour'd to &s;ignalize him&s;elf in a Railing
<PB N="91" REF="62"> Book again&s;t them, which is full as wi&s;e as his Travels, and perhaps the Relations of it much about as true.</P>
<P>Again, we may ob&s;erve this Variation in the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> from the primitive Church. The primitive Church was to have the Sati&s;|faction, or give the Indulgence before the Peni|tents were admitted to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper: But in the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> 'tis always expre&s;s'd and and requir'd as a Con|dition of enjoying the Indulgence, that the per|&s;ons &s;hall have fir&s;t confe&s;s'd, and receiv'd the Communion. The plain Rea&s;on of this is, be|cau&s;e the Offering at receiving of the Commu|nion, is the chief thing which the Indulgence is granted for, and mu&s;t be attain'd by. And the primitive Church never pretended by her Indulgence to relax the Pains of <HI>Purgatory,</HI> or to deliver any from it; for they knew nothing of any &s;uch place or State, as the <HI>Romani&s;ts</HI> have invented.</P>
<P>Further, let us ob&s;erve, That the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Meaux</HI> confe&s;&s;es, as indeed he is forced to do, by the Evidence of holy Scripture, That the Sufferings of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and his Meritori|ous Death, are a full Satisfaction to the Di|vine Ju&s;tice for the Sins of Men. But from hence we may conclude, That at lea&s;t there can be no <HI>need</HI> of Humane Satisfactions, or that we mu&s;t &s;uffer &s;evere penalties to &s;atisfie for our Sins. The Ju&s;tice of God cannot be &s;aid to require more than is nece&s;&s;ary, unle&s;s he be ve|ry unju&s;tly accus'd. But if Chri&s;t has done all in this matter, more than all is more than need to be; a full Satisfaction mu&s;t be enough, and all. Therefore whatever other Rea&s;ons
<PB N="92" REF="63"> there may have been for God's laying tempo|ral Afflictions on Good Men, notwith&s;tanding that he has pardon'd their &s;ins, they are not laid upon them for any Satisfaction to the Di|vine Ju&s;tice. If the &s;uffering of the&s;e were the nece&s;&s;ary and requir'd Condition of our par|taking in the Satisfaction of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, yet it were not proper to call them Satisfactions to the Divine Ju&s;tice for our &s;ins. He therefore in this Explication of the matter, goes be&s;ide the true Doctrine of his Church, and gives a|nother Rea&s;on for the&s;e temporal puni&s;hments. Be&s;ides, the Holy Scripture no where teaches this Doctrine of his: it &s;ays, <HI>By Grace we are &s;aved,</HI> even through the Merits and Satisfacti|on of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, not by any penal Works of our own. And it is no where propos'd as a Condition of our partaking in the Satisfacti|on of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that we mu&s;t pay a part of the Satisfaction due, for our &s;elves. If the Goodne&s;s of God, in conde&s;cen&s;ion to our Weakne&s;s, is content that we &s;hould &s;atisfie for one another, as Mr. <HI>de Meaux</HI> &s;ays: Why may we not believe that the Goodne&s;s of God for that Rea&s;on will accept of, and content him&s;elf with the Sufferings and Satisfaction of Je&s;us Chri&s;t for us all? which indeed the Scripture plainly teaches, and we ju&s;tly believe he has done.</P>
<P>Further, the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Meaux</HI> has been forced in his Explaining their Doctrine, in the&s;e matters, to de&s;troy it; as indeed it does, like other Errors, de&s;troy it &s;elf: To make Men de|pend upon Indulgences, and keep up the Trade of them, he has evidently taken away what he calls the Foundation of Indulgences, and
<PB N="93" REF="63"> the Trea&s;ure of the Church, &s;o far as the Me|rits of the Saints are concern'd in it. He &s;ays, That Men ought, after all that they have done, in order to &s;atisfie for their &s;ins, to fear &s;till that they have fallen &s;hort of the full Satisfa|ction for them&s;elves, and therefore they mu&s;t run from place to place to obtain the Benefit of Indulgences. But then, if any ought to fear this for them&s;elves, all ought to fear it con|cerning them&s;elves. And if this be the Do|ctrine of the Church, all mu&s;t &s;ubmit to, and believe it; &s;o that after all their pretended Su|pererogations, tho&s;e of the Religious Orders ought to fear that they have not made Sati&s;|faction enough for them&s;elves. If <HI>they</HI> ought to fear this, <HI>others</HI> may fear it too, as well con|cerning <HI>tho&s;e Monks,</HI> as concerning <HI>them&s;elves:</HI> And then <HI>all</HI> may ju&s;tly fear that there is no &s;uch a Trea&s;ure of Merits and Satisfactions from their penal and laborious Satisfactions, as is pretended. For he that may be fear'd not to have done enough for <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> may be more ju&s;tly fear'd not to have done enough for <HI>him|&s;elf and others.</HI> He that has not enough for him&s;elf, has none to &s;pare. But the Scripture evidently determines this matter beyond all Contradiction, by de&s;troying the vain Opinion of Supererogations: it teaches us evidently, That no man in this life can perfectly fulfil what he is oblig'd to by the Law of God; and for that Rea&s;on we all need the Satisfaction and Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in order to find Acceptance with God. The great Apo&s;tle St. <HI>Paul</HI> renounces his own Righteou&s;ne&s;s <HI>(Philip.</HI> 3. 9.) and &s;ays plainly, That he could not in this Life pretend to be perfect, in the 12th.
<PB N="94" REF="64"> <HI>Ver&s;e.</HI> The Apo&s;tle St. <HI>James,</HI> of him&s;elf and all Chri&s;tians, in common, &s;ays, <HI>In many things we offend all</HI> (James 3. 2.) The Apo&s;tle St. <HI>John</HI> includes him&s;elf al&s;o with all Chri&s;tians, and &s;ays, <HI>If we &s;ay that we have no &s;in, we de|ceive our &s;elves, and the Truth is not in us,</HI> (1 Epi&s;t. Chap. 1. v. 8.) But if no man can perform all that he is oblig'd to do, certainly no man can do more than that. Further, No Man, nor Company of Men can make a full Satisfaction by all the penal Works which they can do in this Life, but after all, every Man mu&s;t, ac|cording to their Doctrine, go to Purgatory; be|cau&s;e the making Satisfaction for &s;in, &s;o as to e&s;cape the Puni&s;hment due, is the giving &s;ome|thing in&s;tead of that Puni&s;hment which is e|quivalent: But they repre&s;ent the Pains of Purgatory &s;o much more grievous and intole|rable than all that can be endur'd in this Life, that no Penalties endur'd here, can be equiva|lent to them; therefore none can excu&s;e a man's &s;elf from going to Purgatory, therefore they cannot be of Value &s;ufficienty to excu&s;e o|thers from it; and then the Pope's Indulgences and the Privilege of delivering Souls out of Pur|gatory, granted to &s;uch and &s;uch laborious Tasks of Devotion, or chargeable Charities, are an evident Cheat, and good for no|thing.</P>
<P>As for Purgatory, it may be &s;aid, the holy <NOTE PLACE="marg">Purgatory.</NOTE> Scripture &s;peaks indeed of God's vi&s;iting the Iniquities of his People with a Rod, and their Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions with Stripes, even at the &s;ame time when he &s;ays, <HI>His loving Kindne&s;s he will not utterly take from them.</HI> But the&s;e Afflictions are con&s;tantly there referr'd to this pre&s;ent

<P>The fears of this imaginary Fire are indu|&s;triou&s;ly kept up among the deluded People by the mo&s;t frightful Repre&s;entations of it that can be invented. I remember a Story I have read to this purpo&s;e in the Je&s;uite <HI>Eu&s;ebius Nie|rembergius</HI>'s Book concerning the difference be|tween the Temporal and Eternal: This I &s;hall relate here, becau&s;e 'tis not very long, for a Specimen of their Management in this matter. A certain per&s;on, &s;ays he, lay &s;ick of &s;ome painful wracking Di&s;ea&s;es which made his Life a tedious Burden to him, &s;o that he wi&s;h'd ra|ther to die than to endure &s;uch Torments.
<PB N="97" REF="65"> Upon this an Angel was &s;ent to tell him, he mu&s;t yet &s;uffer more for the &s;atisfaction for his Sins, but he might chu&s;e whether he would lie two Years more in this Torment and Mi&s;ery in this World, or lie three Days in the Fire of Purgatory. The wretched man, very &s;en&s;ible of pre&s;ent mi&s;ery, but not knowing what he was about to undergo, cho&s;e to lie three Days in Purgatory; &s;o he was immediately &s;ent thither. When he had been there the &s;pace of 24. Hours the Angel came to make him a Vi&s;it, and ask him, I &s;uppo&s;e, how he lik'd his warm Lodging. The mi&s;erable man was now almo&s;t be&s;ide him&s;elf with the exce&s;s of Torments which he endur'd, and fell upon the Angel with Reproaches, as having cheated and im|pos'd upon him with Lyes.

<P>The Fears thus rais'd inhance the Rate and Value of Indulgences which pretend to remit the Puni&s;hments and Satisfactions due for Sin, and &s;o to exempt from, or mightily alleviate the pains of Purgatory: And how much &s;oever the&s;e Indulgences are multiplyed, and whatever
<PB N="98" REF="66"> mu&s;t be done to obtain them, they will &s;till be follow'd by crouds of People, &s;o long as this Fable obtains belief, who will think they can never be too &s;afe from falling into this terrible Fire.

That Arch looks very great, is full of Carv'd|work and Guilding, and is Wain&s;cot painted with the Colour of the Marble Pillars. The Partition or Rail which runs cro&s;s the great I&s;le before the High Altar is al&s;o white Marble, the whole piece is carv'd &s;o that one can look through in many places, and is carv'd into the Figures of Cupids, and Vines, and Flowers.

<P>As one comes out of the Chappel, at the Door which leads into the Hou&s;e, there &s;tands in a little Room, a large &s;ort of a Box which fills almo&s;t half the Room.

Some were all over em|broider'd with Silver and Gold, and &s;ome with Silk, and the Stalks of the Embroidery, I think of more than one, were &s;et with a multitude of Pearls; one was of flower'd Silk with a great many &s;mall Flowers in it, and the Eye of every Flower was a &s;mall Ruby, there mu&s;t be a great many &s;cores of Rubies in the whole piece. One had a great deal of curi|ous Needle-work of divers Colours in Silk, and in a large Oval in the middle of it was a &s;mall Picture of an hand&s;ome Lady, at full length, whom the Je&s;uit that &s;how'd the&s;e things, call'd the Lady of <HI>Princen-Land</HI> her &s;elf, and I &s;uppo&s;e he told &s;ome of their Religion, whom he &s;poke &s;oftly to, that &s;he had pre&s;ented this.

<P>Be&s;ides this, their very fine Church the Je|&s;uits <NOTE PLACE="marg">Chappel of the Sodali|ty.</NOTE> have here, belonging to this Colledge, a|nother which they call the Chappel of the <HI>So|dality,</HI> where the Fraternities that are wheedled to joyn them&s;elves, and belong to them, do perform their fooli&s;h Devotions upon their &s;o|lemn
<PB N="112" REF="73"> Days. Of the&s;e we mu&s;t give &s;ome Ac|count.</P>
<P>They have joyn'd to them a Sodality or Brotherhood of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> which is ho|nour'd, as they &s;ay, with many Indulgences and Favours: Particularly the Popes have granted to this Fraternity all the Indulgences belonging to the Stations at <HI>Rome,</HI> the which all of the Sodality may enjoy for the Reading &s;even <HI>Pater No&s;ters,</HI> and &s;even <HI>Ave Mary's</HI> in the Church of the Society, or in the Chappel of the Sodality upon particular days of every Month, which are &s;pecified in the Book of the Ordinances of this Sodality, with the Indul|gences that are thus to be obtain'd on tho&s;e Days: Every Month of the Year has &s;everal of them; and one &s;ees on many Days a Plena|ry Indulgence promi&s;ed; on others a thou&s;and Years of Indulgence, on others forty thou&s;and years, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The&s;e are mighty Encouragements to be of this Sodality, and to come to the&s;e places to perform this Devotion, and to be &s;ure (which is the chief End of all) to drop here their Of|ferings, without which, it is a Maxim, no In|dulgence may be obtain'd. The Prayer which they teach the People to make when they en|ter them&s;elves into this Fraternity, after the u|&s;ual manner runs thus:
<Q><P><HI>Holy</HI> Mary, <HI>Mother of God and Virgin, I</HI> N. N. <HI>chu&s;e you for a Lady Patrone&s;s and Me|diatoure&s;s; And I &s;tedfa&s;tly purpo&s;e never to for&s;ake you, never to &s;ay or do any thing again&s;t you, nor yet to permit that any one &s;ubject to my Authority, &s;hall ever do any thing contrary to your Honour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> I be&s;eech</HI>

<P>The Company pre&s;ent, as receiving the Per|&s;on entring, &s;hall &s;ay, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee 'tis a very common and u&s;ual thing with the wretched People in the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> to dedicate and devote them&s;elves &s;o|lemnly to &s;erve and honour their Fellow-crea|tures; that is, to give God's Incommunicable Glory to others than him&s;elf. And the&s;e are not Exce&s;&s;es of Devotion which the ignorant People do of them&s;elves run into, but they are things which they are led and exhorted, and urg'd to do by their Guides, and which are encourag'd and recommended by Bi&s;hops and Popes, by the Indulgences which they &s;a|vour the&s;e Fraternities with. Let us hear what the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Mechlin</HI> thinks fit to &s;ay of the&s;e matters in his Circular Letter. <Q>The Sodalities or Fraternities (&s;ays he) which are erected to her Honour (meaning the Vir|gin <HI>Mary)</HI> I will, and recommend to be ap|plauded, together with the Privileges and Immunities granted them by the Favour of Popes and Bi&s;hops, and that the People be invited, who have not yet done it, to give their Names to them; that new Sodalities be ere|cted, and tho&s;e that are fallen be re&s;tor'd. He that touches the&s;e, let him know, that he touches the Apple of our Eye.</Q> This I ea&s;ily believe, for the&s;e are things which &s;erve to confirm the People in their Errors, to continue

In &s;ome places our &s;ight on that &s;ide was confin'd by a high Dyke or Bank, rais'd to defend the Country within from the Inundations of the River. But on the other &s;ide, which is the Province of <HI>Bra|bant,</HI> we had a very plea&s;ant Pro&s;pect: For the Ground ri&s;es gradually and pretty high in &s;ome places, and &s;o &s;hews it &s;elf to a great di&s;tance. And it &s;hows a rich enclos'd Country divided
<PB N="123" REF="78"> into Pa&s;tures, Corn-fields, Gardens and Or|chards. When we left the <HI>Schelde</HI> we turn'd <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rupell. R.</NOTE> on our left-&s;ide into another River call'd the <HI>Rupell,</HI> over again&s;t a place in <HI>Flanders</HI> which from its being oppo&s;ite to the Mouth of this River is call'd <HI>Rupelmonde.</HI> The <HI>Rupell</HI> is a conjunction of three little Rivers of <HI>Brabant,</HI> the <HI>Neethe,</HI> the <HI>Dyle,</HI> and the <HI>Demer.</HI> The <HI>Dyle</HI> coming down from <HI>Louvain</HI> joins the <HI>De|mer</HI> between <HI>Louvain</HI> and <HI>Mechlin:</HI> They run together under the Name of the <HI>Dyle</HI> to a lit|tile Village call'd <HI>Rump&s;t</HI> below <HI>Mechlin,</HI> where they joyn the <HI>Neethe,</HI> and from thence the whole Stream to the <HI>Schelde</HI> has the Name of the <HI>Rupell.</HI> In this we &s;ail'd upwards, almo&s;t as far as it bears that Name, to a Village cal|led <HI>Willibroeck</HI> where the Canal of <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> en|ters this River, and where we were to leave this our Sailing-Ve&s;&s;el and to go into the <HI>Trech-Schuyt</HI> or Drawn-boat which pa&s;&s;es upon that Canal. About Sun-&s;et we arriv'd at this place, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Canal of Br.</NOTE> went on Board the <HI>Trech-Schuyt,</HI> and in le&s;s than a quarter of an Hour went on. This is a very large and long Boat divided into &s;eve|ral Rooms. I believe we could not be le&s;s than an hundred Pa&s;&s;engers in the &s;everal parts of it. We thought it nece&s;&s;ary to be under cover in the Night, and did not care to be of the Company in the common part of the Boat, and therefore we went into the Roof, which is a clean convenient Room at the Stern end of the Boat, where we &s;ate among the cleane&s;t of the Pa&s;&s;engers. But for this we paid at &s;everal times in the &s;everal Boats, reckoning a|mong them, I think, what we paid in the Sai|ling-Ship to <HI>Willibroeck,</HI> for each per&s;on &s;even
<PB N="124" REF="79"> Stivers and a half. We chang'd our Boat on the Canal four times, for there are on it five Sluces. One is at the entrance of it into the <HI>Rupell,</HI> and the re&s;t were in our way. The Canal is plant|ed with rows of Trees on the &s;ides of it: It runs always &s;trait for a good way together. We had &s;ometimes a very con&s;iderable A&s;cent to mount at the Sluces we came to, when we walk'd from one <HI>Schuyt</HI> to another. The &s;e|veral parts of it run level, but the A&s;cents are at the Sluces: And there is &s;o much A|&s;cent in the whole, that 'tis reckon'd the Sur|face of the Water of the Canall at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> is forty Feet higher in a direct perpendicular than it is at <HI>Willibroeck.</HI> The Sluces are not open'd for the&s;e <HI>Trech-Schuytes</HI> becau&s;e they carry only Pa&s;&s;engers, who can convey them|&s;elves from one <HI>Schuyt</HI> to another: But they are open'd for Ships loaden with Goods, of which a great many come up through this Canal to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els:</HI> We pa&s;s'd by, and met &s;everal in our Pa&s;&s;age. The chief Author, or at lea&s;t the Promoter, of this Magnificent and mo&s;t u&s;eful Work is &s;aid to have been <HI>Johannes Locquenginius, Locquenginii, Berchemii &amp; quelbergiae Dominus:</HI> The Judge for that time of the Civil Cau&s;es at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els.</HI> The De&s;ign was form'd by his Ance&s;tors in the time of <HI>Margaret</HI> of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> the Aunt of <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth, whom that Emperour made Governe&s;s of the&s;e Countries. But it was not &s;et about till towards the time of <HI>Philip</HI> the Second King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and was fini&s;h'd in the Year 1560. The Charge of it is reckon'd to amount to a|bout Five hundred thou&s;and Crowns. We were five Hours on this Canal, and the length
<PB N="125" REF="79"> of it is reckon'd to be &s;o many Leagues. We went the length of three Mile <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in an Hour, which is the common pace of the <HI>Trech-Schuyts,</HI> and were drawn with two Hor&s;es. When we came to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> we deliver'd our Tickets, and were di&s;mi&s;s'd without farther payment. We lay down in a Hou&s;e without the City till Morning becau&s;e the Gates were &s;hut, and none could be admitted to go in.</P>

<HEAD>BRUSSELS.</HEAD>
<P>THis City by the Latins call'd <HI>Bruxella,</HI> by the French <HI>Bruxelles,</HI> and by the People of the Country <HI>Bru&s;&s;el,</HI> is al&s;o very Ancient, and the beginnings of it are ob&s;cure and un|known. It pretends to have been a City from about the Year of our Lord 974; and to have had its utmo&s;t encrea&s;e, and pre&s;ent extent from the Year 1369. It is &s;ituate, part of it, on the &s;ide of a little Hill which it runs up to the top of, and part in a Valley. The en|crea&s;e of it from what it was at fir&s;t is very e|vident by the Remainders of the old and fir&s;t Wall, which with &s;ome of its Ports is &s;till &s;tanding, and appears in &s;everal places of the City. The outermo&s;t Wall was begun to be built in the Year 1357, and was fini&s;h'd in the Year 1369. The Compa&s;s of this Wall is &s;aid to be le&s;s than of that of <HI>Louvain</HI> by 200 Paces; but this City within is more built than that, and therefore is reckon'd to contain more People. It &s;eems indeed to be very full of People. The newe&s;t Wall has &s;even Ports, and on that &s;ide which is at the top of the Hill
<PB N="126" REF="80"> is a high round Brick Building which is a Watch-Tower, from whence they can look over all the City and far about in the Country. The Bombarding of the <HI>French</HI> in the Year 1695 fell mo&s;t upon the Inner City, though indeed it de&s;troy'd the greate&s;t part of that. We ac|cording to our De&s;ign lodg'd not far from the Court near a large and good old Building which belongs to our King, and is call'd the Palace of <HI>Na&s;&s;au:</HI> This is included in the Inner City, but e&s;cap'd the Bombarding. This Ci|ty is &s;ituate in a rich and plentiful Country, and &s;tands very Airy and Healthy. There is on one &s;ide of it a large Tract of Meadows, but 'tis chiefly encompa&s;s'd with Hills that ri&s;e gent|ly up and have upon them wide open Fields of Plough'd Ground, the Soil' being very fit for Corn. The Country here is &s;o very plentiful that in time of Peace it affords Provi&s;ion for the greate&s;t Concour&s;e of People. In the time of the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth, 'tis &s;aid there came together at once to this City 7 Crown'd Heads, be&s;ides &s;everal other le&s;&s;er Sovereign Princes, and all of them were attended with a great Retinue. They were reckon'd to bring together 18000 Hor&s;es, yet there was no want of Provi&s;ion for this great Company. Between the two Walls of the City are the Court or Palace with the Park belonging to it; the Pa|laces al&s;o of &s;everal of the Nobility of the&s;e Countries, be&s;ides Gardens of the Citizens, and &s;ome Meadows which make the City the more Healthy and Plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Senne,</HI> which ri&s;es in the Pro|vince of <HI>Hainault,</HI> on that &s;ide next to <HI>Bra|bant,</HI> runs through the lower part of this City.
<PB N="127" REF="80"> It divides it &s;elf into two Channels a little be|fore it enters the City, and then comes in al|mo&s;t at an equal di&s;tance on each &s;ide the Port of <HI>Anderlecht.</HI> It makes &s;everal I&s;lands in the City, uniting and dividing its Streams &s;e|veral times. It runs on in <HI>Brabant</HI> to <HI>Vil|vorde,</HI> a little Town upon the Canal, and from thence falls into the <HI>Dyle</HI> below <HI>Mech|lin.</HI> This little River affords the Water which furni&s;hes the great Canal. This City is plenti|fully furni&s;h'd be&s;ide with Springs of Water, which feed &s;ome publick Fountains, and &s;erve al&s;o the private Hou&s;es, and it is as good Wa|ter as is to be met with perhaps in any of the Countries of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> has long been, and &s;till is the Seat of the Chancery of <HI>Brabant.</HI> The Office of Chan|cellor is a great Dignity, and of great Impor|tance; for he is reckon'd, in effect, the Go|vernour of <HI>Brabant,</HI> and a &s;ort of Deputy to the Duke him&s;elf. Other Courts al&s;o to which all this Province come upon &s;everal Occa&s;ions, are held here. There is in this City likewi&s;e an Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Court for the Dioce&s;s of <HI>Cam|bray,</HI> to which all Cau&s;es Eccle&s;ia&s;tical come, which do happen within that part of the Dio|ce&s;s that runs into <HI>Brabant.</HI> Be&s;ides the&s;e things which occa&s;ion many People to come hither, in the&s;e latter times, <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> has been the Seat and u&s;ual Re&s;idence of the Governour of the <HI>Belgick Provinces,</HI> who has here kept his Court, which has occa&s;ion'd a Concour&s;e of the Prin|cipal Nobility and Gentry of the&s;e Countries, and the building &s;o many Hou&s;es for them, as there are here. It has Fifty two Colledges, as they are call'd, of Trade&s;men, which we
<PB N="128" REF="81"> in <HI>London</HI> call Companies, and the&s;e are di|&s;tributed into Nine Parts, which are called here the <HI>Nations.</HI> At <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> the Art of making Tape&s;try now flouri&s;hes, and &s;ome of the be&s;t in the World is made here; &s;ome of the choice of which is &s;een in the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI>'s Apartments in the Palace: It is thought wor|thy to be the Furniture al&s;o of &s;ome of the fi|ne&s;t Rooms in the Palaces of other Princes of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Governour of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Do|minions in the <HI>Belgick Provinces,</HI> under <HI>Charles</HI> the Second King of <HI>Spain,</HI> is <HI>Maximilian Em|manuel, Duke of both the</HI> Bavaria's, <HI>and of the</HI> Palatinate, <HI>Archdapifer of the Sacred Empire, E|lector Count Palatine of the</HI> Rhine, <HI>Landtgrave of</HI> Leuchtenberg, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> A Prince of great Re|nown tho' but in the prime of his Years, glorious for Martial Conduct and Valour, of which he has given many eminent Proofs. He is a per|&s;on of unwearied Activity and Vigour, of a great Spirit, has large Dominions, and perhaps much larger Hopes. He was ab&s;ent when we were here, at his laborious Plea&s;ures of Hunt|ing, in which he takes great Delight, &s;o we could not &s;ee him.</P>
<P>The Palace &s;tands in &s;ome of the highe&s;t part of the City. It is built round a very large Court: Behind it is a De&s;cent of a great many Steps to the Gardens which lie in a little Val|ley between that and the Park. There is an open Gallery of a good length on this &s;ide, a|long which &s;tands &s;everal Stone-Statues which repre&s;ent &s;ome of the Ancient Dukes of <HI>Bra|bant.</HI> From the Garden-Wall the Ground ri|&s;es very &s;teep, and &s;hows the Park above it
<PB N="129" REF="81"> to the lowe&s;t Rooms of the Palace. The Park is planted with Lime-Trees in Rows, and &s;tock'd with Dear; there are in it &s;ome wild Grot|to's of Rock-work, and all together affords a very plea&s;ant &s;hort pro&s;pect to the Rooms on this &s;ide of the Palace. We went out of the Park into a Garden where the Water-works are &s;hown; tho&s;e we &s;aw are in a long Stone-Building which &s;tands in the Form of a Piazza: the in&s;ide of which, with the Pillars and Ar|ches on the Front of it, are cover'd with Mo|ther of Pearl, Sea-&s;hels, pieces of cragged Stones, Sea-plants, and the like. The Water in one Divi&s;ion within &s;ets on work &s;everal &s;orts of Handicrafts men, as a Smith, a Car|penter, a Brace of Sawyers, and others. In another there is a pretty Ca&s;cade of Water: in one there is an attempt of a perpetual Moti|on which cannot be de&s;crib'd &s;o as to give a ju&s;t Idea of it to one that has not &s;een it. In &s;hort, there are two men &s;et at the two ends of a Ballance: he at the left end, as they are before us, is heavier than he who is at the right end: Therefore he de&s;cends and lifts the other up. The other when lifted up holds a little Bucket to a &s;mall Spout of Water which falls into it, and when that is full this man be|comes heavier by vertue of his Water than the other, and thereupon weighs the other up, but in de&s;cending he &s;pills his Water and the other immediately brings him up again. While the Water is filling his Bucke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">, a &s;mall Wood|en Ball &s;lowly de&s;cends three rows of Wires, falling from one to the other, and at la&s;t drops into the Lap of the lower man; by that time it is there the man with the Bucket de&s;cends
<PB N="130" REF="82"> with the weight of his Water, and then this man ri&s;ing carries up the Ball, and throws it upon the uppermo&s;t row of Wires; there are two Balls, and the matter is &s;o order'd that one or other of them is always in motion. In ano|ther Divi&s;ion a Duck drinks but without lifting her Head, I &s;aw her empty &s;everal times a Shell of Mother of Pearl which the Servant held to her full of Water. There is one Ma|chine ca&s;ts out the Water in the common Fi|gure of a Start. Other Water-works there are which we could not &s;ee by rea&s;on of the Ab|&s;ence of the per&s;on that mu&s;t &s;how them.</P>
<P>The Stables belonging to the Palace are ve|ry Magnificent, and capable of holding above an hundred Hor&s;es. Over them is a large Chamber which they call the Armoury. Here are kept the Weapons and Armour u&s;ed in for|mer times, but all that is here belong'd to Princes: Some to the Dukes of <HI>Burgundy</HI> who were the Sovereigns of the&s;e Provinces before they fell to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria:</HI> There is the Armour of &s;everal Emperours; &s;ome very fine Armour of the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the Vth; the Armour of &s;ome of the Princes who go|vern'd the&s;e Countries under the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au|&s;tria.</HI> In &s;ome Pre&s;&s;es here are kept the Har|ne&s;s and Furniture belonging to the Electours be&s;t Coach. The Seats are of Scarlet Velvet very thick overlaid with an Embroidery of Gold, the Harne&s;s is cover'd with the &s;ame, I think, and al&s;o much embroider'd with Gold, the Buckles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are guilded, and there are many Ta&s;&s;els of Gold and Silver-thred mingl'd, with a very deep Fringe.</P>
<PB N="131" REF="82">
<P>This City will be much the finer for having been Bombarded; for whereas before the Hou&s;es were old and built for the mo&s;t part with Timber, they will be now new, and built with Stone or Brick; and a great many ofthem are built after the new fa&s;hion with Cantilivers at the top of the Front. The Fronts of the Hou&s;es on the Great Market are built very fine, and of Stone, &s;ome White, &s;ome Blew. The Stone|work is carv'd into tall Pillars which reach from the bottom to the top of the Hou&s;e, and the top is form'd into a hand&s;ome Arch; there are other Ornaments al&s;o in the Work, and of &s;ome Hou&s;es a great deal of the Work is at proper places guilded. But it &s;eems to le&s;&s;en &s;omewhat the Beauty of all this Finery, that every Hou&s;e has its own form of Architecture, and differs from its Neighbours: The Hou&s;es being commonly very high even to the height of four or five good Stories, and yet but very narrow, the Architecture looks not well pro|portion'd and too high for the Breadth. Up|on the top of the Front of one of the&s;e Hou&s;es is &s;et a large E&s;&s;igies of the pre&s;ent Governour the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> on Hor&s;eback: It &s;eems to be very good Work, and looks bold and brave; there is on the Pede&s;tal an <HI>Elogium</HI> of this brave Prince but &s;o &s;et that it cannot ea&s;ily be all read, it being very high. The City, or Se|nate-hou&s;e is repair'd, the Frontis-piece which is very fine and good Architecture &s;uffer'd ve|ry little from the Bombs: And I think the Tower which &s;tands up from the middle of the Hou&s;e with a large Image in Bra&s;s at the top of it repre&s;enting St. <HI>Michael</HI> &s;tanding upon the Dragon, e&s;cap'd them too: This Image is &s;aid
<PB N="132" REF="83"> to be fifteen Feet in height. Right again&s;t the Senate-hou&s;e, with Front to Front, &s;tands on the other &s;ide of the great Market the Shell of a very large Hou&s;e, which &s;eems by the Front yet remaining to have de&s;erv'd the Name of a Palace, as they have been wont to call it: This Hou&s;e was built by a Baker of this City, I could not learn the Name of the Vain-glorious Fool. It was call'd to us now, <HI>the King's Hou&s;e,</HI> as belonging to the King of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>The Angel <HI>Michael</HI> is the reputed Guardian <NOTE PLACE="marg">Wor&s;hip of Angels.</NOTE> or Patron of this City. What kind Offices the Angels do for Mankind are done by God's Command and at his Direction and Appoint|ment: But I know not any ground we have to take the liberty of chu&s;ing whom we plea&s;e of them for our Protectours: Nor can I find that it has ever been reveal'd to this People, that God has committed the care of their City to this particular Angel. I know not what particular Devotions they pay to this good Spi|rit for his Protection, neither: But I know that the Scripture expre&s;sly forbids and con|demns the Wor&s;hip of Angels. An evident Text to this purpo&s;e we have in <HI>Colo&s;&s;.</HI> 2. 18. It is worth taking notice upon this Occa&s;ion what Sence the Je&s;uit <HI>Menochius</HI> puts upon this Text of H. Scripture, becau&s;e he is forced by the Evidence of it to condemn his own Church. The Apo&s;tle, &s;ays he, does here condemn the Errour of <HI>Simon Magus.</HI> That Heretick a&s;|&s;erted that God was Inacce&s;&s;ible, that we have need of the holy Angels to go between him and us: We ought therefore to apply our &s;elves to the Angels, to entreat them to intercede for us. The Sence of the place therefore &s;ays he is this:
<PB N="133" REF="83"> Whoever would &s;educe you by a feign'd Hu|mility, as if it were an Arrogance to pray to God immediately or to apply our &s;elves to Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, and &s;o would induce a fal&s;e wor|&s;hip of Angels let him not be regarded. Tho' he reckon'd he had left the wor&s;hip which the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> pays them &s;afe, by putting in the word <HI>Fal&s;e,</HI> yet he has evidently enough condemn'd both their wor&s;hip of Angels and of Saints, &s;o far as they are built upon this ground, that God, or our Saviour in his Glo|ry, is &s;o much above us, that it becomes us not to addre&s;s immediately to him, but we &s;hould rather engage &s;ome Inferiour Interce&s;&s;ours to recommend us to God. This Plea in <HI>Simon Magus</HI> he condemns, and in &s;o doing he con|demns it in the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> too, which puts into the Peoples Mouths this very excu&s;e for their wor&s;hip of Saints and Angels. And if the wor&s;hip of Angels out of a pretended Hu|mility is here forbid, doubtle&s;s all wor&s;hip of them is forbidden; for no other rea&s;on, that will go any further than this, can be a&s;&s;ign'd for it. If Gratitude for good Offices receiv'd would ju&s;tifie this, St. <HI>John</HI> had not been for|bid to do it, by the Angel him&s;elf, who was the Me&s;&s;enger of the Revelations he had re|ceiv'd. The good man, like a &s;incere and in|&s;pir'd Writer confe&s;&s;es, that the weakne&s;s of Humane Nature had betray'd him into an Er|rour; and that he had been &s;o far tran&s;ported by a Sence of the Favours which this Angel had oblig'd him with, that (as he &s;ays, <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">v.</HI> 22. 8.) <HI>He fell down to wor&s;hip before the Feet of the Angel who had &s;how'd him tho&s;e things.</HI> But the Angel (as he &s;ays again in the 9th <HI>v.)</HI> for|bad
<PB N="134" REF="84"> him the doing thus, &s;aying, <HI>See thou do it not, for I am thy Fellow-Servant, and</HI> a Fellow-Servant <HI>of thy Brethren the Prophets, and of them that keep the Sayings of this Book. Wor&s;hip thou God.</HI> The Angel knew of no Wor&s;hip due or lawful to be paid to Creatures: The good Spirit therefore refus'd &s;uch an extravagant Ac|knowledgment of what he had, by God's Or|der and Command, done for the Apo&s;tle. He directs St. <HI>John</HI> aright, and bids him wor&s;hip God, and give him Thanks for the Benefits re|ceiv'd. A good Angel would not take this Honour to him&s;elf, which he knew did not be|long to him. This Admonition, <HI>Wor&s;hip God,</HI> as it is connected here, &s;ignifies plainly as much as to &s;ay, wor&s;hip God alone, according to the Import of the fir&s;t Commandment in the De|calogue. His Rea&s;on of forbidding the Apo|&s;tle to wor&s;hip him, which was, that he was his Fellow-Servant, reaches evidently to the forbidding all Wor&s;hip to be given either to Saints or Angels.</P>
<P>Having &s;aid thus much concerning the Wor|&s;hip of Angels, I &s;hall proceed to repre&s;ent the Honour and Wor&s;hip of them which the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> teaches and recommends to her People. I have met with Opportunity and Means to learn this from them&s;elves, and a|mong them: that we may yet further under|&s;tand how the Practices of that Church do a|gree, or rather di&s;agree with that mo&s;t &s;ure and perfect Rule and Guide to Happine&s;s, the Holy Sciptures. There is a Fraternity erect|ed and recommended among them in the&s;e Countries, under the Title of an A&s;&s;ociation in order to die well, under the Protection of
<PB N="135" REF="84"> the Guardian-Angels. This I &s;hall give &s;ome ac|count of, as what will afford us a Summary of their Doctrine and Practices in this matter.</P>
<P>To recommend this Society the People are <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fraternity of the Guardian-Angels.</NOTE> taught as follows. They &s;ay, the Angels pre|&s;ide over all things here below; they have &s;et one over the Element of Fire, tho' later Phi|lo&s;ophers have de&s;troy'd his Kitchin; one over the Element of Water, whom they will have to be the Author of the Flux and Reflux of the Sea. They &s;ay every Nation has an Angel its particular Guardian; and that 'tis probable every City and Town has one of the&s;e Spirits for its Protector. And they confidently affirm, that every particular per&s;on has his Guardian-Angel, who is appointed to attend him.</P>
<P>This Guardian-Angel, to whom they a&s;&s;ign a great deal of other Drudgery and Attendance, they &s;ay is our Advocate at the point of Death again&s;t the Accu&s;ations of the Devil; and that he pleads for us then, and reckons up on our behalf all the Alms, Fa&s;tings, Confe&s;&s;ions, Communions, Au&s;terities, Penances that we have ever done. And they tell pretty Stories relating to this matter; as, That St. <HI>John</HI> the Alms-giver, once throwing a Loaf at the Head of a rude and trouble&s;om Beggar, more out of Anger and Impatience, than out of Charity, the Angel pleaded for him, and obtain'd, that the Loaf made an Amends for the Impatience, and was put to the Account of his Charity for all that. And in the precious Annals of the Or|der of St. <HI>Francis</HI> 'tis &s;aid, That the Guardian-Angel of a certain Gentleman who was dead without Confe&s;&s;ion, tho' he had not confe&s;s'd him&s;elf in 20 years together, produced in fa|vour

But when this is made &s;o indi&s;pen|&s;ible Duty as it is in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and yet an Act of Charity, as they call it, to the lazy, u&s;ele&s;s Religious, could countervail the Neglect of it, we may &s;ee how the In&s;tructions of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> are contriv'd to promote a good Life.

The&s;e Guardian-Angels, they pretend, when any per&s;ons are dead, do take a great deal of Care to &s;ollicit the Prayers of their Friends, and of other good People for them; and e&s;pecially do they endeavour particularly to procure Ma&s;&s;es for the dead, or certain Communions; for there is nothing, they &s;ay, does &s;o &s;oon quench the great Flames of this Fire, as the Blood of the Lamb which we &s;acrifice on the Altar.

<P>It is &s;aid, There are no good things in the Order of Nature, which the Angels do not af|ford their Clients; and there are no good things in the Order of Grace, which they do not ask, and infallibly obtain, if we &s;econd their La|bours. Yea, we &s;hall certainly po&s;&s;e&s;s the great Goods of the heavenly Glory by the Interven|tion of the&s;e faithful Friends, if we commit our &s;elves to their Conduct. The Condition of ob|taining the&s;e things from their Guardian-An|gel, the People are taught, is, if they will &s;erve him faithfully. The Honour which we are ca|pable to render the Angels, is &s;aid to be in&s;epa|rable from the Care that we ought to have for our Salvation. And as much as we de&s;ire to be &s;av'd, with the &s;ame Degree of Ardour we ought to &s;eek and &s;ecure the Favour of the&s;e ble&s;&s;ed Spirits.</P>
<P>Let us &s;ee now what Cour&s;e the People are directed to take, in order to gain the Favour of the&s;e good Spirits, and their A&s;&s;i&s;tance in all times of need. An extravagant honouring of them is urg'd for this purpo&s;e; and they teach, That they mu&s;t be honour'd by our avoiding of all Wickedne&s;s, and by our Sufferance of af|flictive Evils, and by our Prayers to them. The Apo&s;tle &s;aies, <HI>Whether ye eat or drink, or what|ever ye do, do all to the Glory of God:</HI> But the <HI>Romani&s;ts</HI> teach, that the&s;e things &s;orementi|on'd may and mu&s;t be done to the Honour of the Angels, and for their Honour, in order to obtain their A&s;&s;i&s;tance e&s;pecially at
<PB N="138" REF="86"> the Hour of Death. It is worth while to ob|&s;erve what is propos'd as a Pattern to the World for the honouring of the Angels by Suf|ferance and Prayers.</P>
<P>A certain namele&s;s per&s;on, they tell us, who was devoted to the Angels, accu&s;tom'd him&s;elf to the&s;e following Sufferances in Honour of them. The fir&s;t Mortification he underwent, was, That he very readily aro&s;e in the Morn|ing from his Bed. And they &s;ay <HI>John Cartera</HI> a Religious of the Company of Je&s;us, was for two Years together depriv'd of the &s;ight of his good Angel, who had been wont to awake him every day at the due hour, for his having once loiter'd a little, and not ri&s;en pre&s;ently. Another Mortification which he bound him|&s;elf to, was, That being up, he immediately fell on his Knees before his Oratory, where he had an Image of the Angel-Guardian. He in the fir&s;t place, then, thanked God for his Mer|cies which he had be&s;tow'd upon him; and, after he had paid his Re&s;pects to Je&s;us, and to his Mother, he gave thanks to his good Angel for the Benefits which he had conferr'd upom him during the Night. He conjur'd him to hinder him from falling into any mortal Sin: He of|fer'd to him all his Actions, to the end that <HI>he</HI> &s;hould unite them to tho&s;e of Je&s;us Chri&s;t: He pray'd <HI>him</HI> (that is, the Angel) to apply the Satisfaction of all his good Works, as of the Ma&s;s, or the Chaplet to &s;ome Soul or other detain'd in the Fire of Purgatory. It is certain|ly a very odd &s;ort of Notion to put Prayer and Acts of Devotion among the Works of Morti|fication and Sufferings; he is but in a very ill &s;tate of Mind, and &s;adly indi&s;pos'd to pray he
<PB N="139" REF="86"> mu&s;t be, to whom it is grievous to do this: And I doubt tho&s;e Prayers he makes in that ca&s;e, will find but little Favour or Acceptance. But this is the con&s;tant way of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> to put their Tasks of Devotion among their Penances and Mortifications. We may ob&s;erve here al&s;o, that the People are taught to depend upon the Angel for their Intere&s;t in the Merits of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the Acceptance even of their good Works, and al&s;o to be kept from mortal Sin. Thus are the greate&s;t Ble&s;|&s;ings in this way of Wor&s;hip di&s;ir'd, and ex|pected to be obtain'd, not only by, but al&s;o from the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ed Spirits, which is not a Reliance certainly upon their Interce&s;&s;ion alone, but e|ven upon them&s;elves for the good things we de&s;ire, which is an Honour due to God a|lone.</P>
<P>To proceed; 'Tis &s;aid, That on every <HI>Tue&s;|day,</HI> which is the day particularly con&s;ecrated to the&s;e glorious Spirits, from the Morning he girt him&s;elf with a Girdle which was made very unea&s;ie to him with &s;harp Points of Iron turn'd towards his Body, and in the Evening he end|ed his day with a bloody Di&s;cipline. But be it known, that altho' the Super&s;titions and extra|vagant Rites of Religion, which the Devil has at any time taught the World, have always had a Tincture of Cruelty, and unrea&s;onable Severity, and have betray'd therein the Malice of that wicked Spirit; yet this is not the Cha|racter of true Religion, which is gentle, and kind, and u&s;eful in all its Injunctions. And accordingly the kind Angels who are endow'd abundantly with that di&s;po&s;ition, cannot be &s;up|po&s;ed to be delighted, or to take it as done at
<PB N="140" REF="87"> all to their Honour, that Men &s;hould hurt or torment them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Further, 'tis &s;aid and propos'd as a Pattern to others for their Imitation, That this Per&s;on fa&s;ted in Honour of the Angels at lea&s;t twice in a Yeat (we mu&s;t under&s;tand this does not mean that he fa&s;ted but twice in a Year; but it is intended to &s;ignifie, that he kept at lea&s;t two Fa&s;ts in a year in Honour of the Angels, and which he de&s;ign'd to honour them by) To wit, on the la&s;t day of <HI>February,</HI> and on the la&s;t day of <HI>September;</HI> becau&s;e the holy Church in ma|ny places celebrates the Fe&s;tival of the Guar|dian-Angels on the fir&s;t day of <HI>March,</HI> and on the fir&s;t of <HI>October.</HI> And this he did, we mu&s;t know, to di&s;po&s;e him&s;elf by the&s;e Ab&s;tinences, to receive tho&s;e Showers of Graces which they pour down particularly on this day. This &s;ure is to make the Angels Di&s;pen&s;ers of the&s;e good Things, and to teach the People to expect and de&s;ire them from them. About the time of the&s;e two Fea&s;ts he went to vi&s;it the Pri&s;ons and Ho&s;pitals, to comfort and a&s;&s;i&s;t the Sick and Impri&s;on'd there with his Alms. And this al|&s;o is done in Honour, and to the Glory of the Angels. And thus they u&s;ually put the Exer|ci&s;es of Charity, and the giving of Alms, which are &s;ome of the greate&s;t Plea&s;ures that can po&s;|&s;ibly be, to a good and well-di&s;pos'd Mind, a|mong the Works of Mortification and Sufferance. 'Tis a fine Story they tell of St. <HI>Gregory,</HI> who came to be Pope, to encourage this giving of Alms in Honour of the Angels. He, &s;ay they, having given a Dinner to 12 poor People, he &s;aw one of them who became very beautiful, and glorious as an Angel, and &s;aid to him, <HI>Gre|gory,
<PB N="141" REF="87"> you thought with your &s;elf that you gave your Alms to a poor Man, but you have given them to an Angel; and God has &s;ent me to be con&s;tantly from henceforth near you, and to guard you to the la&s;t Period of your Life. For a Recompence further of your Liberality, you &s;hall be Head and Univer|&s;al Pa&s;tour of the Church, and all that which you ask of God, you &s;hall obtain by my means.</HI></P>
<P>Thus is there a Pattern framed to teach People by, in what things they mu&s;t honour their Guardian-Angel by Sufferance. They go yet further, and in the &s;ame method teach and direct how they are to be honour'd by their Prayers to them. It is &s;aid therefore of this unknown Per&s;on, as follows:</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he was ri&s;en, and while he was upon his Knees, having done what hasbeen &s;aid before, he implor'd the Succour of his Angel in the&s;e following words, which all Believers (&s;ay they) ought to know, and to recite every Morn|ing.</P>
<LG>
<L><HI>Angele Dei, qui Cu&s;tos es mei,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Me tibi commi&s;&s;um pietate &s;uperna,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Hodie, illumina, cu&s;todi, rege, guberna.</HI></L>
</LG>
<P>Here they call the Angel their Keeper, tho' indeed 'tis acknowledg'd he is &s;o by the Divine Commi&s;&s;ion: But they al&s;o pray to him di|rectly to illuminate, keep, govern and guide them.</P>
<P>Again, before he began any Bu&s;ine&s;s, he made the &s;ame Prayer to his Guardian Angel. More|over, as often as he heard the Clock &s;trike, he recommended his Soul to him again&s;t the point of Death, &s;aying,</P>
<LG>
<L><HI>Angele Dei, qui Cu&s;tos es mei,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Adjura me nunc, &amp; in hora mortis.</HI></L>
</LG>
<PB N="142" REF="88">
<P><HI>O Angel! Who art commi&s;&s;ion'd to keep me, a&s;&s;i&s;t me now, and in the hour of my Death.</HI> At the end of his Mental (by which they mean <HI>ex tempore)</HI> Prayer which he made in the Morning, He be&s;ought the good Angel to beg for him of God, a firmne&s;s in his Re&s;olutions; and to thank him for all the Light and Knowledge which he had communicated to him; and to obtain what he &s;hould ask for his Friends and fellow A&s;&s;ociates. Before he began his Study, he begg'd the Illu|minations of his Coele&s;tial Pedagogue; and he offer'd to him his Labours for the Glory of his Ma&s;ter, and for the Salvation of his Soul.</P>
<P>He never fail'd to a&s;&s;i&s;t (or be pre&s;ent) eve|ry day at the Holy Sacrifice of the Ma&s;s: And it was at this time that he fir&s;t recited the Office of the Guardian Angels, and after that their Chaplet or Ro&s;ary, which he did in this man|ner. Upon the Cro&s;s which hung at his &s;tring of Beads, he &s;aid the <HI>Te Deum Laudamus.</HI> Up|on the great Beads he &s;aid the <HI>Gloria Patri,</HI> to thank God for the Favour he had done him, in giving him an Angel: And upon the little Beads he recited the Prayer afore&s;aid. <HI>Angele Dei,</HI> &amp;c. (This then was &s;aid in the Place of the <HI>Ave Mary's;</HI> and truly I believe it might be done with as much Profit, with leave of the good Fathers, the <HI>Dominicans.)</HI> At the time of the elevation of the Sacred <HI>Ho&s;tie,</HI> he recom|mended his Soul, and that of all his fellow A&s;|&s;ociates, into the Hands of Je&s;us for the Hour of his and their Death. He communicated every Month, and at lea&s;t once to the Honour of his Dear Guide; and after this Communion he renew'd the Prote&s;tations of Fidelity to his Guardian Angel, which St. <HI>Charles Borromaeus</HI>
<PB N="143" REF="88"> did from time to time make to his: He al&s;o every Month vi&s;ited the Chappel dedicated to the Angel. 'Tis added this may be done on the fir&s;t Tue&s;day of every Month; and the Peo|ple are bid to remember that Tue&s;day is the day particularly de&s;tin'd for the Honouring of the Ble&s;&s;ed Spirits by the Church; and that there is a Ma&s;s for that day in particular which the Prie&s;ts may celebrate, and which any one may cau&s;e to be &s;aid in a ca&s;e of Nece&s;&s;ity (for a good Pay.)</P>
<P>Every Year in the Month of <HI>October,</HI> he ce|lebrated the Fea&s;t of the Holy Guardian An|gels, with an extraordinary Devotion. He at|tended the Sacraments with the greate&s;t Pre|paration; he redoubled his Alms, his Au&s;teri|ties, his Fa&s;ts, his Prayers. He renew'd thro' the whole <HI>Octave,</HI> the Prote&s;tations of St. <HI>Char. Borromaeus,</HI> in the Chappel of the Angel, which he vi&s;ited every day.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Every day before he lay down to re&s;t, he implor'd the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Holy Pro|tector, by the Litanies of the Angels which he recited upon his Knees. This is that, 'tis &s;aid, which the A&s;&s;ociates ought to do every Even|ing, or during the time of Ma&s;s. And 'tis im|po&s;&s;ible for any Man to have an ill Death, when he has &s;o much wi&s;h'd, and &s;o much begg'd the Grace to die well, by the&s;e Devotions.</P>
<P>See here, ye Dear A&s;&s;ociates (&s;ay they) what Practices are to be perform'd in Honour of the Angels: And from what has been &s;aid, the&s;e &s;ix important Verities (as they are call'd) are recommended to be the &s;ubject of &s;erious Meditation. (1.) God is willing to &s;ave us by the Mini&s;try of our Angel-Guardian. (2.) In
<PB N="144" REF="89"> the ordinary Cour&s;e of his Providence, he will no otherwi&s;e &s;ave us. (3.) This Guide will infallibly procure our Salvation, if we earne&s;t|ly demand it. (4.) This great Affair of our Salvation depends upon our Death. (But with|out doubt it is rather true to &s;ay it depends up|on the manner of &s;pending our Life.) (5.) There is no one but our Angel who will as of Duty, be concern'd to a&s;&s;i&s;t us at our Death, and to protect us in this grievous Combat. (6.) The more Prayers there are for, and the more Per|&s;ons that demand the &s;ame Grace, the more ea&s;ily &s;hall they obtain it. This is an effect of the Communion of Saints. Therefore the more A&s;&s;ociates there are in this Brotherhood, the more certainly may they hope to obtain the Grace to die well. The&s;e now are wonderful Inducements to wheedle Men into this A&s;&s;ocia|tion of the Guardian Angels, in order to &s;ecure a happy Death; and this la&s;t is a pretty mo|tive to per&s;wade tho&s;e who are in it to be decoys to others to bring them into the &s;ame Net.</P>
<P>Now we &s;hall take a more particular account of this Society, What is intended in it, and what they are directed and bind them&s;elves to do, who enter them&s;elves into it.</P>
<P>This A&s;&s;ociation, they &s;ay, is nothing el&s;e but a Holy and Secret Union made between Believers, who being per&s;waded of the great Importance of dying well, and of the Succours which we ought to expect from the good An|gels in that Moment, do unite their Prayers and their Vows which they addre&s;s to the&s;e amiable Protectors for this end. So that this A&s;&s;ociation is plainly a Combination of People,
<PB N="145" REF="89"> who bind them&s;elves to the voluntary Humi|lity and Wor&s;hipping of Angels, which the Holy Scripture forbids. Yet this is &s;aid to be an A&s;&s;ociation which Heaven has in&s;pir'd Men with the de&s;ign of, and does Authorize with a multitude of Favours; which the Believers who are engag'd in it, regard as a mark of their Prede&s;tination to Eternal Glory, and which the Prelates of the Church, the Arch-Bi&s;hops, and the Bi&s;hops, who endeavour to conduct their Flocks to Heaven, do effectually recommend; opening to the A&s;&s;ociates, the Trea&s;ures of Indulgencies, of which they are the Di&s;pen&s;ers.</P>
<P>The Rules of A&s;&s;ociation are the&s;e;</P>
<P N="1">1. Tho&s;e who enter this Society, mu&s;t con|fe&s;s and receive the Communion at lea&s;t once a Year, either on the day of their Fe&s;tival that is the fir&s;t of <HI>March,</HI> or the fir&s;t of <HI>October,</HI> or upon &s;ome other day that may prove more convenient. The de&s;ign and end of this Com|munion ought to be the &s;ame with that of the A&s;&s;ociation, that is, to obtain for them&s;elves, and all the re&s;t of the A&s;&s;ociates, the Protecti|on of the Angels at the Point of Death, and particularly the Grace to die well. Commu|nicate then to the Honour of the Angels, &s;ay they: Here is one of the highe&s;t Acts of Divine Wor&s;hip order'd to be perform'd to the Ho|nour of Creatures: Receiving the Communion as they &s;ometimes &s;peak of it, is &s;aid to be an Offering to God the Victim of his Immaculate Son; and this they do to the Honour of the Angels. What can de&s;erve the Name of the mo&s;t impious and dete&s;table Idolatry, if this does not? Is this no more than to pray the An|gels to pray for us?</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="146" REF="90">2. They mu&s;t promi&s;e, to vi&s;it the Chappel which is dedicated to the Guardian Angel at lea&s;t once a year; and if this can conveniently be, it &s;hould be done on the day of the Fea&s;t of the Guardian A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">gels to gain the Indul|gence.</P>
<P N="3">3. They of the Society mu&s;t promi&s;e to their good Angel, to recite every day the Office or Litany of the Angels, or the Te&s;tament of St. <HI>Charles Borromeus:</HI> (which I &s;hall produce anon) Or if they cannot read, they mu&s;t pro|mi&s;e to recite three times the <HI>Pater No&s;ter,</HI> and three times the <HI>Ave Mary,</HI> to the Honour of the three Coele&s;tial Hierarchies, that they may obtain for all the A&s;&s;ociates, in whatever part of the World they be, the Grace to die well.</P>
<P>The Form of the A&s;&s;ociation, which is an Engagement to the Service of the Angels, as they &s;peak, is as follows:</P>
<P><HI>My mo&s;t dear and kind Angel, Guardian of my Body and my Soul, whom God has commi&s;&s;ion'd to watch over and keep me at all times, but par|ticularly at the hour of my Death; Di&s;plea&s;ed with my &s;elf for my pa&s;t Ingratitudes, I come now to make to you an inviolable Prote&s;tation of my Service.

<P>The Prote&s;tation or Te&s;tament of St. <HI>Charles Borromeus,</HI> mentioned before, I &s;hall now in|&s;ert, ju&s;t as it is, though &s;o long, becau&s;e I pur|po&s;e to repre&s;ent all the&s;e matters as I have them from the Romani&s;ts them&s;elves. It runs thus:</P>

In the Year 1369. as &s;ome of the Hi&s;torians of this Countrey put it, one <HI>Jo|nathan</HI> a <HI>Jew,</HI> with an ill De&s;ign, bought of a Certain Curate of St. <HI>Catharine</HI>'s Church a Box with three con&s;ecrated Wafers in it: He being afterwards kill'd by &s;ome Per&s;ons, his Enemies, his Wife gave the Box to their Son named <HI>Abraham,</HI> with the <HI>Ho&s;ties</HI> in it.

<HEAD>What the Ro&s;ary is.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>Ro&s;ary,</HI> or Garland of Ro&s;es, is a Set of Prayers to the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> intermixed with the Lord's Prayer. The&s;e, both one and other, are number'd by the Beads which one &s;hall &s;o often &s;ee in the Hands of the People in <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Countries, e&s;pecially when they go to Church. The String of Beads is tied together at the ends, and has commonly fifty &s;mall, and five greater Beads in the round; and there are be&s;ides a|bout ten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> I think, of the &s;mall Beads with one great one upon a little &s;trait String, with a Cro&s;s, which hangs to the other. On the &s;mal Beads
<PB N="155" REF="94"> they &s;ay &s;o many <HI>Ave Mary's,</HI> as the&s;e Pray|ers to the Virgin are commonly call'd, becau&s;e they begin with the Words of the Angel's Salutation of her, when he came to tell her &s;he &s;hould be honour'd with bearing the <HI>Me&s;&s;ias.</HI> To which Salutation they have added, more|over, that of <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and a Conclu&s;ion in the Form of a Supplication to the B. Virgin: The whole Prayer runs thus:</P>
<P><HI>Hail</HI> Mary, <HI>full of Grace, the Lord is with thee, ble&s;&s;ed art thou above all Women; and ble&s;&s;ed is the Fruit of thy Womb, Je&s;us: Holy</HI> Mary, <HI>Mother of God, pray for us poor Sinners now, and in the Hour of our Death.</HI></P>
<P>This Prayer is repeated ten times, and then comes the Lord's Prayer, which is repeated as often as the great Beads come. The whole <HI>Ro|&s;ary,</HI> or Garland of Prayers con&s;i&s;ts of this String of Beads three times repeated, which comes to fifteen times ten <HI>Ave Maries,</HI> and fifteen <HI>Pater No&s;ters.</HI></P>

<DIV4 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>When, and upon what occa&s;ion the <HI>Ro&s;ary</HI> was in&s;tituted.</HEAD>
<P>This method of Devotion &s;o erroneou&s;ly par|tial to the Virgin, whom they pray to ten times in it for one Prayer to Almighty God, has no other Foundation but a Story as impu|dent as &s;illy, and evidently devi&s;ed to derive it from the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin her &s;elf. Indeed this does but help to fill up the Parallel between <HI>Rome</HI> Heathen and Popi&s;h; and if <HI>Numa Pom|pilius</HI> might pretend to derive his Rules of Re|ligion from a Godde&s;s; why might not the ho|ly <HI>Dominick</HI> derive his from &s;uch an one too?
<PB N="156" REF="95"> Thus then, as they &s;ay, this great and divine In&s;titution as brought into the World. When the holy <HI>Dominick</HI> had been in continual con|tention in the Country of <HI>Tholou&s;e,</HI> with (tho&s;e wicked People) the <HI>Albigen&s;ian</HI> Hereticks (who always abhorr'd and refus'd to receive the Corruptions of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church) as well by preaching, di&s;puting, and writing of Books, as by wonderful Signs and Miracles; and now three years and more time was pa&s;t in great Trouble and Labour, but with little Profit: The H. Man not being able any longer to en|dure the great Ob&s;tinacy of the&s;e Hereticks, together with their impious and dete&s;table Bla&s;|phemy (as 'tis call'd) again&s;t the mo&s;t immacu|late Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> at length he left them, and retir'd to a Cave in a Wilderne&s;s not far from thence, and there with many Sighs and Tears he applied him&s;elf for Aid to the Queen of Heaven, mo&s;t earne&s;tly imploring her A&s;&s;i&s;tance, it being her peculiar Work to tread under foot the Head of the cur&s;ed Serpent, and to de|&s;troy and bring to nought all new Sects and Here&s;ies. (Pretty well! here we have a&s;crib'd to the Virgin in Words, what one &s;hall often &s;ee in Pictures, that is, the Victory over the Devil, foretold from the beginning of the World, and applied by all the primitive Church to Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, as being meant of him our great and only Redeemer.)</P>
<P>Continuing thus in Prayer, and cha&s;tening his Body for three days together with Fa&s;tings, at la&s;t the holy mother of God reveal'd her &s;elf to him now lying very weak and fainting under the Blows of Iron Chains, and to him &s;he &s;aid; <HI>My Son</HI> Dominick, <HI>becau&s;e you have very faith|fully
<PB N="157" REF="95"> &s;trove again&s;t the Enemies of me and of the Truth, I, whom you have call'd to, am ready to give you my A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</HI> She had not &s;ooner &s;aid this, but behold three Maids appear'd of mo&s;t wonderful Beauty, who, having rais'd up <HI>Do|minick</HI> from lying flat upon the Earth, they &s;et him before <HI>Mary;</HI> &s;he then mo&s;t lovingly em|brac'd, and ki&s;s'd him, and making bare her Virgin Brea&s;ts, &s;he gave him &s;uck (poor Fool) thus comforting his &s;inking, thir&s;ty Heart with this mo&s;t delicious Draught. Then &s;he &s;poke to him again, &s;aying, <HI>My faithful Friend</HI> Dominick, <HI>know you not what In&s;truments God hath been wont to make u&s;e of when he would reform and renew the World?</HI> Upon which he made an&s;wer; <HI>Oh, gracious Mother! you know that better than I do, for the World through you hath obtain'd its Salva|tion, through you is the beginning of all our Re|demption and Renovation. Mary</HI> then &s;miling upon him (a fooli&s;h <HI>Coquette</HI> indeed would be likely to do &s;o, when &s;he had been prodigiou&s;|ly flatter'd, and a fond Admirer had a&s;crib'd to her what were infinitely above her Merits) &s;he &s;aid, <HI>God, that he might take away all Wick|edne&s;s, hath cho&s;en no other In&s;trument but only the Angelick P&s;alter, the which is the Foundation of the whole New Te&s;tament. If therefore you de&s;ign ever to do any good with your Preaching, do you recommend and preach up my P&s;alter, and in a lit|tle time this evil &s;hall come to an end.</HI> After this <HI>Mary</HI> proceeded largely to explain and &s;how the manner how to read the P&s;alter or her <HI>Ro|&s;ary;</HI> relating al&s;o to him the Excellency of the &s;ame, and the Profitablene&s;s of it, with the Vir|tue and wonderous Power of it. In fine, &s;he gave <HI>Dominick</HI> a Charge that he &s;hould &s;trait-way
<PB N="158" REF="96"> repair to <HI>Tholou&s;e,</HI> and there pre&s;s and urge the &s;ame, admoni&s;hing him to be of good Cou|rage. But the Holy Man fore&s;eeing great dif|ficulty (for by rea&s;on of the Rage of Here&s;ie, he &s;aw no means to fulfill this Charge) he fell again at the feet of <HI>Mary,</HI> and an&s;wer'd thus. <HI>Oh mo&s;t Dear Mother! You know how ob&s;tinate and &s;tiff-necked this People are? How can it be that they &s;hould &s;uffer me to preach before them? You know how many and &s;ubtle de&s;igns they con|trive again&s;t me? How is it po&s;&s;ible that I &s;hould di&s;charge my &s;elf of this task, and preach to them your</HI> Ro&s;ary?

<P>The Holy Father <HI>Dominick</HI> went &s;trait way to <HI>Tholou&s;e;</HI> when he came thither, all the Bells of the City began to ring of them&s;elves; the People hereupon in Multitudes, ran to the Church, and found there <HI>Dominick</HI> (who was ready for them) mounted into the Pulpit. With wondrous Earne&s;tne&s;s and Zeal, he be|gins to hold forth to them the Prai&s;es and Ex|cellencies of the <HI>H. Ro&s;ary.</HI> The Hereticks im|mediately &s;et them&s;elves to oppo&s;e him, &s;ome began to go out of the Church, others to cry out and make a Tumult. When behold on a &s;udden, there aro&s;e &s;o terrible a Storm, with Wind and Thunder and Lightning, and the Sky grew &s;o di&s;mal dark, and to all this there was added &s;uch a mighty Earthquake, that one would have thought the whole World were

Man that he would intercede with the Holy Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> for them. And &s;trait-way throwing them&s;elves all together upon the Ground, and wringing their Hands, they be&s;ought the Fa|vour of God and <HI>Mary</HI> with Sighs and Tears that cannot be expre&s;s'd. <HI>Mary</HI> then gave ear to their Prayer, and did immediately for a Token of her Mercy, draw to her &s;elf again her threatning Arm, &s;o as that every one there pre&s;ent could &s;ee it done. And at the &s;elf &s;ame time did all the &s;tormy and tempe&s;tuous Wea|ther cea&s;e, and turn into a Calm. Upon this did the <HI>Holy Dominick</HI> proceed in his Di&s;cour&s;e with greater Zeal than before, and he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d forth

<HEAD>The manner of entring this Society, and &s;ome Rules of it.</HEAD>
<P>Tho&s;e that enter them&s;elves in this A&s;&s;ociati|on or Brotherhood, are &s;aid to put them&s;elves into the number of the Servants of the Holy Maid <HI>Mary;</HI> and are directed in doing it, to make a firm Re&s;olution in this following form.</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> N. N. <HI>Acknowledge and Confe&s;s, that I do with all my Heart put my &s;elf under the defence of the mo&s;t H. Maid</HI> Mary, <HI>the Mother of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and Queen of the Holy</HI> Ro|&s;ary; <HI>whom in the be&s;t manner that I can, out of a &s;incere Love and Affection of Heart, I chu&s;e for my principal Patrone&s;s; firmly re&s;ol|ving that I will, through her help, and that of Almighty God, diligently perform the&s;e things following.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. When my appointed hour is come, I will immediately, if it be po&s;&s;ible, either in the Church or el&s;ewhere, as I can be&s;t do it, ei|ther on my bended Knees, or as Opportunity and Convenience will allow, begin to read the <HI>Ro&s;ary</HI> of 15 Tens, and at the &s;ame time Medi|tate upon the 15 My&s;teries of the Life and Death of our good Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. I &s;hall offer the fir&s;t part of the <HI>Ro&s;ary</HI> (that is the fir&s;t 50 <HI>Aves)</HI> to God for the Uni|on of Chri&s;tian Princes, the Extirpation of He|re&s;ie, and the Conver&s;ion of Sinners. The 2d.
<PB N="167" REF="100"> part I &s;hall offer up to God for the pre&s;ent Ne|ce&s;&s;ities of my Country, and for the Nece&s;&s;ities of all tho&s;e who are in their la&s;t Extremities. The 3d. part I &s;hall offer up for the &s;preading and advancement of the Glory and Honour of the mo&s;t Holy Maid and Mother of God, <HI>Ma|ry,</HI> and for the relea&s;ing of the poor Souls in Purgatory. Then I will add to this, the Lita|ny of our good Lady, on the behalf of all tho&s;e who have given them&s;elves up to this Exer|ci&s;e.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome few further Re&s;olutions men|tion'd, concerning the care that the Per&s;on will take to have the&s;e matters perform'd for him, when he is lawfully hindred, which I need not in&s;ert.</P>
<P><HI>Dominick</HI> at fir&s;t order'd that all the Brothers and Si&s;ters &s;hould read a whole <HI>P&s;alter</HI> of <HI>Ma|ry,</HI> that is 15 times 10 <HI>Ave Mary's,</HI> with the due <HI>Pater No&s;ters</HI> every day. This was &s;ome|thing a trouble&s;om Task, and &s;o after times have mitigated it. And now this Task mu&s;t be per|formed once a Week, to the Glory of God, and of the Holy Maid, they &s;ay. And it needs not now be read all at once, or kneeling in the Church at any particular time, but 'tis enough that it be fini&s;h'd by the end of the Week.</P>
<P>If any Brother be de&s;irous to be a Partaker in the devout <HI>Laud</HI> and <HI>Salve Regina,</HI> which eve|ry day immediately after <HI>Compline</HI> is &s;ung in the Churches of the <HI>Dominicans</HI> with a &s;olemn Pro|ce&s;&s;ion, he mu&s;t be pre&s;ent at the <HI>Laud</HI> and <HI>Proce&s;&s;ion,</HI> or el&s;e read 7 <HI>Ave Mary's</HI> in what Place &s;oever he is, for him&s;elf, and for the other Brothers.</P>
<PB N="168" REF="101">
<P>Fora&s;much as the Holy Widow <HI>Anna</HI> has brought forth this honourable Fruit the holy Maid <HI>Mary,</HI> therefore that we may be in &s;ome mea&s;ure thankful, the Founder of this Brother|hood has wi&s;h'd and de&s;ir'd that the Brothers and Si&s;ters would, to the Honour of the&s;e three, namely, the holy Mother <HI>Anna,</HI> her Daughter <HI>Mary,</HI> and Chri&s;t the Son of God and of Man, read on every <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> three <HI>Pater No&s;ters</HI> and three <HI>Ave's.</HI></P>
<P>For the Souls of the Brothers departed, after the four principal Fea&s;ts of our good Lady, which are the Purification, the Annunciation, the A&s;&s;umption and Birth, four yearly Solem|nities &s;hall be held at the Altar of the <HI>Ro&s;ary,</HI> at which Solemnities all the Brothers and Si&s;ters ought to be pre&s;ent, and to which they are in|vited by great Indulgences (where they mu&s;t however drop their Offerings as well as their Beads, or el&s;e there is no Indulgence for them.)</P>
<P>Moreover, 'tis &s;aid there are e&s;pecially three Fea&s;t-days which all of this Society ought to &s;o|lemnize, which are the Fea&s;t of our good La|dy's Annunciation on the 25th of <HI>March,</HI> the Fea&s;t of the <HI>Ro&s;ary</HI> on the fir&s;t <HI>Sunday</HI> in <HI>Oct|ber,</HI> the Fea&s;t of the H. <HI>Dominick</HI> on the 4th. of <HI>Augu&s;t;</HI> and this mu&s;t be done in the Chap|pels belonging to this Order. The H. Mother of God <HI>Mary</HI> her &s;elf has will'd, that the Fea&s;t|day of the H. <HI>Dominick</HI> &s;hould be celebrated with particular Devotion, and &s;he has reveal'd this her &s;elf to the B. <HI>Alanus de Rupe,</HI> and has order'd that the Brothers &s;hould acknowledge St. <HI>Dominick</HI> for the &s;econd Patron of this Bro|therhood, becau&s;e he fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h'd, preach'd,

<HEAD><HI>An Admonition to All Men to enter them&s;elves in the Brotherhood of the H.</HI> Ro&s;ary.</HEAD>
<P>I think fit to produce this, becau&s;e the Rea|der will hereby under&s;tand from them&s;elves of what Extent and E&s;teem this Brotherhood is in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and what are the Baits that catch Fools into this &s;ort of Snares. The Admonition was thus.</P>
<P>It were very fitting, that among good Chri|&s;tians, not to &s;ay among the Lovers of <HI>Mary,</HI> there &s;hould not any one per&s;on be found, who is not enter'd into the renown'd Society of the holy Ro&s;ary, or who will not &s;uffer him&s;elf to be per&s;waded to do this as &s;oon as may be; as well for the Abundant Indulgences therein to be enjoy'd, as al&s;o for the following Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e the H. <HI>Ro&s;ary</HI> was at fir&s;t found out by <HI>Mary</HI> her &s;elf, and through her Com|mand in&s;tituted and order'd by St. <HI>Dominick,</HI> and was at the fir&s;t In&s;titution and Beginning of it attended with &s;uch miraculous and wonder|ful Signs at <HI>Tholou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Whoever is enter'd in this Brotherhood, will be a Partaker of innumerable Merits; that is to &s;ay, of all the good Works, Fa&s;ts, Vigils, Pray|ers, Alms-deeds, Martyrdoms, Di&s;ciplines, Ser|mons, Ma&s;&s;es and the like, which are perform'd by the whole Order of the <HI>Dominicans,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ts of &s;o many Religious, and of tho&s;e al&s;o which are done by &s;o many millions of Per&s;ons as are enter'd in this Brotherhood. Certainly
<PB N="170" REF="102"> you would be happily provided for, if it were &s;o that there were but only one H. per&s;on that would at all times pray for you. But now in this far renown'd Brotherhood there are a great many holy and perfect per&s;ons in who&s;e Me|rits and prayers you might be a Partaker.</P>
<P N="3">3. You can no way take a more effectual care that your Soul may be helped in Purgato|ry with many Prayers and Indulgences, than by entring your &s;elf into this Brotherhood; for I dare &s;ay, and can a&s;&s;ure you, that there is no King, nor Emperour, nor Pope, nor any Monarch whatever, that has &s;o many Prayers &s;aid for his Soul as one departed Brother or Si|&s;ter of the holy Ro&s;ary; which may be very ea&s;ily made appear from all the Ma&s;&s;es and an|nual Solemnities which are perform'd and ob|&s;erv'd for the Brothers of this Society.</P>
<P>For you mu&s;t know, and it is a matter well worth Ob&s;ervation, that through the whole World in all Places, Cities, Corporations and Villages where this Society is erected, there is always every year at four Sea&s;ons a Ma&s;s per|form'd for the decea&s;ed Brothers and Si&s;ters. (This has been mention'd before, with the times of it.) Now all the&s;e being added together, and reckon'd according to the multitude of places where this Brotherhood is maintain'd, as well in all the Kingdom of <HI>Spain,</HI> as in <HI>France, Po|land, Italy, Germany,</HI> the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> &amp;c. would make out every year more than twelve hundred thou&s;and Ma&s;&s;es: To which may be added all the Ro&s;aries and Vigils that are read and ob|&s;erv'd every Week, and al&s;o all the good Works that are daily done in the whole Order of the <HI>Dominicans,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of &s;o many thou&s;and Re|ligious;
<PB N="171" REF="102"> and in this Society al&s;o wherein are &s;o many millions of Brothers and Si&s;ters. All which good Works and Prayers come to the account of the Souls enter'd in the Society, and do ex|tend to the making Satisfaction for them. I think what Comfort and Con&s;olation this is for a poor Soul, the which otherwi&s;e perhaps might be left lying in the Fire of Purgatory, without having any per&s;on to &s;ay one <HI>Pater No&s;ter</HI> for it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"></P>
<P N="4">4. In the la&s;t place, it is greatly to be e|&s;teem'd that in this Society there is no Obliga|tion or Burden; and that &s;o great a Trea&s;ure may be obtain'd, as it were, without labour, by reading only once a Week a whole <HI>Ro&s;ary,</HI> that is, one hundred and fifty <HI>Ave Maries,</HI> and fif|teen <HI>Pater No&s;ters,</HI> which may be divided into three Garlands, each containing five of the a|fore&s;aid; and the&s;e may be &s;aid in any time of the Week as men will, either going, &s;tanding, &s;itting, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (Thus is this recommended here as a fine ea&s;ie way to Heaven, and yet the ea&s;i|ne&s;s of it is forgotten when the&s;e Tasks of De|votion are enjoyn'd, as Penance and Mortifica|tion. In truth the&s;e things are ea&s;ier to hu|mane Nature, than the nece&s;&s;ary Care and En|deavour to lead a truly good a virtuous Life; and this is the real Di&s;paragement of them that are devi&s;ed and u&s;ed to excu&s;e &s;uch Care and Endeavour, and pretend to bring Men to Hea|ven by another and an ea&s;ier way.)</P>
<P>Further, He that has forgotten or neglected to &s;ay his <HI>Ro&s;ary</HI> in one Week, may &s;ay it in the Week following, the which if he does, he &s;hall perfectly recover his Lo&s;s. And if any man will not do that, and &s;o will let &s;lip one
<PB N="172" REF="103"> reading of his <HI>Ro&s;ary,</HI> he does not &s;in in tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ing the Rule of the Society. So that no man can excu&s;e him&s;elf for not entring into this Society, and for neglecting &s;o great good, and depriving his Soul of &s;o great Indulgences and Privileges.</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> All &s;orts of Per&s;ons, young and old, may be enter'd herein, and al&s;o the dead, pro|vided any one will perform the due Task, and read weekly a whole <HI>Ro&s;ary</HI> for them: And no man is bound to continue this longer than he plea&s;es; but &s;o long as he does continue to do it, he makes the decea&s;ed per&s;on Partaker of all the good Works which the living Brothers perform, and &s;hall obtain for him all the In|dulgences of this Society, <HI>per modum Suffragii,</HI> (that is, no one knows how.)</P>
<P>A world of Indulgences are granted to this Society to draw them to the Chappels of the Ro&s;ary, and drop their Offerings often in a Year. I &s;hall not trouble my &s;elf or my Reader with the mention of any of them; for I think it now high time to direct to &s;omewhat el&s;e.</P>
<P>The Je&s;uits have here a Colledge and a School; they were in the year 1604. encreas'd from &s;mall Beginnings to the number of 70 per|&s;ons. Their Hou&s;e e&s;caped the Bombs, or per|haps the Bombs avoided that.

<P>Civil Broils were the ruine of this va&s;t Trade, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Civil Di&s;|&s;entions.</NOTE> and put an end to the Pro&s;perity of this City, which now looks old and decay'd and too big for its Inhabitants. The occa&s;ion of this Mi&s;chief was this. The City had always been govern'd by the Families of the Nobility, who govern'd it in the Form of a Senate; but when Trade had made the Commons rich, they di&s;dain'd to be govern'd, and grew &s;o proud, that they would needs have a Share in the Government. After many In&s;urrections and Seditions to this purpo&s;e, they alter'd the ancient Government, and obtain'd that an equal Number of Com|mons &s;hould &s;it in the Senate-Hou&s;e with the Nobility, and with equal Authority. Then they had broken the Power of the Government, and it became too weak to hinder them from doing Mi&s;chief to one another; they were divided into Parties and Factions, which often fell to|gether by the Ears.

The City had utterly &s;unk by this means, and made it &s;elf an heap of Rubbi&s;h, if the Prince had not &s;etled here an Univer&s;ity, which, together with &s;ome little Linen-Trade, is the pre&s;ent Suppott of it.

He therein lays to their charge, that they opine and &s;peak with too little re&s;pect of the Au|thority of the Pope of <HI>Rome;</HI> that they de&s;pi&s;e the Church of their own Time, and cry up the Ancient, and Primitive &s;tate of Chri&s;tianity: That they are for correcting and rectifying the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Di&s;cipline of the pre&s;ent Times: That they &s;et them&s;elves again&s;t the Religious Families (that is, the &s;everal Orders of Monks, tho&s;e u&s;ele&s;s drones that live in ea&s;e and plenty, upon &s;pecious cheats) that they reproach and calumniate the&s;e good People, and &s;eek to &s;up|pre&s;s them. They are blam'd by him for making it a &s;olemn and &s;erious matter to come to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper; and for urge|ing that People mu&s;t come with minds purified from worldly and carnal affections; and for in|&s;i&s;ting upon a true repentance and amendment of Li&s;e, as nece&s;&s;ary to the obtaining Ab&s;olution.
<PB N="188" REF="111"> And it is reckon'd a mighty fault that they ob|liquely &s;trike at the Wor&s;hip of the B.

And tho&s;e have been found he &s;ays (Oh horrid Crime) who have reflected upon the u&s;ual Sa|crifices or Ma&s;&s;es of Catholicks for the relief of the Dead; as if the Prie&s;ts that &s;ay them, have more comfort and benefit from them, than any Souls in Purgatory. The con&s;equence of the&s;e things he &s;ays is, that the Common People do many of them for&s;ake the cu&s;toms of their Fa|thers, grow fond of Novelties, and many others hang in doubt and &s;u&s;pence what they &s;hould do. (That is, whether they &s;hould reform in matters that need to be reform'd, or go on &s;till in all their old Super&s;titions and Idolatries.) Such divi&s;ions too there are among all &s;orts of People upon the&s;e matters, that he fears a Schi&s;m, he &s;ays, and that at length &s;ome will &s;hake off the bridle of Obedience, and rend the &s;eamle&s;s Coat of Chri&s;t in pieces.

<P>I have met with a further account of the&s;e <HI>Jan&s;eni&s;ts,</HI> as &s;pread within the Dominions of the States General of the <HI>United Provinces;</HI> &s;ome particulars of which I th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">k it worth while to produce, becau&s;e they do agree with what has been &s;aid of them already; tho I cannot pretend it to be &s;o Authentick as the former: for it eviden<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ly betrays it &s;elf to have been forg'd among the Je&s;uits, whom, hone&s;t People, one never knows when to believe. It &s;peaks out fully the old &s;pite of that Order again&s;t the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Louvain,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Anthony Arnauld,</HI> the famous Doctor of the <HI>Sorbonne,</HI> and their terrible Scourge. It imputes <HI>Jan&s;eni&s;m</HI> to the generality of the Secular Prie&s;ts, within the Dominion of the States General of the <HI>&V;nited Provinces;</HI> whom the Author repre&s;ents to be in great numbers &s;pread about and fixed in Pa|rochial Cures in tho&s;e Provinces. The&s;e he makes to have been infected with this feign'd Here&s;ie, by vertue of their being bred in that wicked place, the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Louvain;</HI> and partly by the influence which Mr. <HI>Arnauld</HI> afore|&s;aid had for a long time in the&s;e Countries, whom he will have to have liv'd at <HI>Delft,</HI> du|ring the time of his retirement, which was for &s;everal Years, to avoid the malice of the&s;e Fa|thers,

<P>This Author imputes to the&s;e <HI>Jan&s;eni&s;ts</HI> in <HI>Holland,</HI> that they hold and teach all the ex|tremity of the Prede&s;tinarian Doctrine, in all the enormity and ab&s;urdity of it; but this one cannot ju&s;tly believe of them, as well, becau&s;e they con&s;tantly di&s;own and reject all that, as becau&s;e the <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> of the&s;e Countries fall foul upon them on the other &s;ide, and have treated them very rudely, and ill, becau&s;e they will not explain the Points belonging to that Controver&s;ie ju&s;t as they do.</P>
<P>That which I de&s;ign e&s;pecially to take notice of is the Noveltie&s;m practice, which they are &s;aid to introduce among the Papi&s;ts in the&s;e Countries. There are, 'tis &s;aid, many of the&s;e Prie&s;ts who regard as null and invalid the Con|fe&s;&s;ions made to any of the Religious Orders, and upon that ground do require of the People when they come to them, that they begin and make to them the Confe&s;&s;ion of their whole Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e-pa&s;t, even notwith&s;tanding that they had made a general Confe&s;&s;ion at the la&s;t J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">bile. They put in practice the maxim of Mr. <HI>Arnauld,</HI> in his book of frequent Communion, which is, That tho&s;e who want a &s;incere and pure love of God ought to be &s;eparated from the Holy Com|munion. (It is indeed a heinous crime with the Je&s;uits to in&s;i&s;t upon the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of the love of God, either to fit men for this Communion, or for their Salvation.) The&s;e Prie&s;ts are &s;aid to impo&s;e hard and rigorous Pen|nances for very &s;mall Crimes. Many of them, par|ticularly
<PB N="191" REF="112"> at <HI>Rotterdam, Delft,</HI> and the adjacent places, pronounce the Sacramental words of <HI>Bapti&s;m, Ab&s;olution, Marriage</HI> and <HI>Extream Unction</HI> in the Vulgar language, when they admini&s;ter the&s;e Sacraments. Some pronounce tho&s;e words twice; That is, fir&s;t in <HI>Latine</HI> and then in <HI>Dutch,</HI> and that without fear of com|mitting Sacriledge by this Repetition of the &s;a|cred words, which do not operate the &s;econd time that which they &s;ignifie. They condemn and di&s;parage in their Sermons, and Books which they di&s;tribute among the Prote&s;tants, the rich and co&s;tly furniture of Altars, and the magnifi|cence of con&s;ecrated Ve&s;&s;els: They with <HI>Judas</HI> (to put them in good company) call this a wa&s;t of expence, and a true Luxury. And for the mo&s;t part they make &s;o little account of Indulgences, e&s;pecially of tho&s;e which are to be applied to the Souls in Purgatory by way of &s;uffrage; that there are many, and tho&s;e &s;ome of the Principal among them, who refu&s;ed to publi&s;h, others who very negligently pub|li&s;h'd, that of the Year 1690. granted by Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> VIII. which is the more &s;urprizing, &s;ays this per&s;on, becau&s;e the Catholicks of <HI>Holland</HI> have been wont to have a particular de|votion for the&s;e things; e&s;pecially for the In|dulgence which is granted to the general month|ly Communion, for the living and the dead. The&s;e Gentlemen, he &s;ays, do particularly de|claim again&s;t this, and endeavour to aboli&s;h the u&s;e of it. They &s;peak of Purgatory in a very unworthy manner, and yet wor&s;e of the Relicks of the Saints. They publi&s;h that we are not bound to believe that the Saints know the Pray|ers which men make to them. They do not content them&s;elves only to leave out the Title
<PB N="194" REF="113"> of <HI>Immaculate,</HI> which their Ance&s;tors were wont, time out of mind, to give to the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin in the <HI>Dutch</HI> Creed: nor to change the Phra&s;e in the Angelick Salutation, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">t thou above all Women,</HI> into this, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed art thou among Women;</HI> But they have al&s;o gone further than all this, and have taken away from this Salutation all that which transforms it into a Prayer, leaving out the&s;e words, <HI>Holy Mary Mother of God pray for us Poor &s;inners now and in the Hour of our Death.</HI> And the retrenching of this is the more &s;candalous, he &s;ays, becau&s;e the&s;e words are the only ones which the Pro|te&s;tants di&s;approve of in the <HI>Ave Mary.</HI> And he concludes 'tis an infinite thing to go about to recount all the like novelties which they run into, they are &s;o numerous.

<P>To <HI>Jan&s;enius</HI> in this Lecture &s;ucceeded his Friend <HI>Libertus Fromondus,</HI> a follower of his O|pinions, and the Editer of his Book. By ad|ditions of later times the Faculty of Theology here is augmented to Nine Profe&s;&s;ions: And the ordinary College or Society of this Faculty is made up of Eight Doctors, whom they call Legents and Regents: Becau&s;e to the&s;e alone
<PB N="195" REF="113"> belongs the Authority of governing the School of Theology, and the Students of the Faculty; and of examining the Students in order to their taking of Degrees, and the&s;e alone enjoy the Emoluments of the School.

At length tho&s;e of the Religious Orders are allow'd admi&s;&s;ion into this College; but with this re&s;triction, that there &s;hall never be two of the &s;ame Order in this Society at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>There are in this Univer&s;ity of founded Schools and Colleges 32, be&s;ides the Colleges <NOTE PLACE="marg">Colleges.</NOTE> of the Religious Orders. Some of the&s;e are appropriated to the Arts, &s;ome to Languages, to Hi&s;tory, to Politicks, &s;ome to other particu|lar Faculties: And &s;ome are not confin'd to any one &s;ort of Study, but &s;erve in general for all. There are &s;ome Colleges to which certain an|nual Sums are left by the Founders, for pro|vi&s;ion for &s;o many Students, which not being ordinarily enough to provide them their diet, they mu&s;t &s;upply the remainder out of their own Stock. In others there is a full and &s;uf|ficient provi&s;ion &s;o made for their Diet. In o|thers be&s;ides Diet, they are allow'd by the Foun|dation Fire, and Candle, and &s;ome further a&s;&s;i&s;tance for their Studies. The&s;e allowances they call here Pur&s;es. They are for the mo&s;t part annexed to &s;uch and &s;uch Colleges, and expre&s;ly de&s;ign'd for the encouragement of par|ticular Studies, which therefore, they who en|joy them are bound to follow. Some Pur&s;es are given, which leave the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors at liberty in what College they will to re&s;ide, and &s;o to
<PB N="196" REF="114"> what Study they plea&s;e to apply them&s;elves. Every College has its Pre&s;ident, who has the direction of the Manners and Studies of the Students, and the Care of the Family: And be&s;ides him, there are Vi&s;itors either appoint|ed by the Founder, or deputed by the Univer|&s;ity, or by the Heads of the particular Faculties. It is their bu&s;ine&s;s to admit to the Enjoyment of the Pur&s;es belonging to the College to vi&s;it, at &s;tated times in the Year, and enquire into the Studies and Manners of tho&s;e who enjoy the Pur&s;es; and to Audit the Accounts of the College once in a Year. I went into &s;ome of the Colleges, and found them built round a Court; in one corner of which from the bot|tom to the top was the Pre&s;idents Apartment; in another place the Chappel: And all the Rooms below were of &s;ome general u&s;e; as Dining Room, Kitchin and the like.

<P>The Je&s;uits that fir&s;t invaded this City were <NOTE PLACE="marg">Je&s;uits.</NOTE> but two; they could do no great feats, there|fore more were added to the Number, at length they were &s;trong enough to build a College or Ca&s;tle, being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a good Legacy left them by <HI>Torrentius,</HI> Bi&s;hop <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Antwerp;</HI> and then they &s;oon fell to making War upon this Univer&s;ity. They have had a mighty mind to hold publick Schools here for the Arts, and for Theology. They have u&s;ed all their Arts, which are many, both fair and foul, to accom|pli&s;h this. Again&s;t their fir&s;t Attempts the fa|mous foremention'd <HI>Cornelius Jan&s;enius,</HI> (who was born for their &s;hame, and ruine at la&s;t)
<PB N="197" REF="114"> was twice &s;ent into <HI>Spain</HI> as Deputy of the Uni|ver&s;ity; who manag'd the Cau&s;e of the Univer|&s;ity &s;o well in the Court of <HI>Spain,</HI> that the&s;e Fa|thers were then defeated, and forbidden to do what they had &s;o much mind to. This good &s;ervice done to Truth and Ju&s;tice, and the In|tere&s;t and Quiet of the Univer&s;ity, was the fir&s;t foundation of all the &s;pite and malice, with which tho&s;e good Fathers have &s;ince per&s;ecuted the Book and Memory of Bi&s;hop <HI>Jan&s;enius.</HI> To this day, I was told they have not been able to accompli&s;h the erecting of any School here, but they are only permitted to Catechi&s;e Chil|dren in their Chappel; which they do every Lords day in the Afternoon, at the time of Ve&s;pers.</P>
<P>They have here a Chappel which is very large, and looks great and Magnificent, but is not fine. The Fronti&s;piece is good, and well-pro|portion'd Architecture, and very large and high. At the top in the Stone-work, is the Cypher for the Name Je&s;us, which is call'd, I think very unfitly, the Arms of the Society: On each &s;ide of this is a Fame with a Trumpet: If we may interpret the Figures by the Actions of the Society, we may &s;ay they &s;ignifie, that the renown or I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;amy of the Society is &s;pread every where by Fame; rather than that the Honour of Je&s;us Chri&s;t is &s;pread by their So|ciety. They are very angry with a Per&s;on that Interpreted the <HI>J, H, S,</HI> in the Cypher, to &s;ignifie as <HI>Latin</HI> Letters, <HI>Je&s;uitae Habent Satis;</HI> and indeed we may be angry with him too, for we cannot think they have yet had their de|&s;erts. The Chappel &s;tands in a ri&s;ing Street, and one &s;ees it from below, which advantage
<PB N="198" REF="115"> together with the height of it, makes it look great. In that place too the Street is wide, and gives room enough to view the Fronti&s;|peice all at once, and with advantage to the proportions: to the bottom of that and the en|trance of the Chappel is an A&s;cent from the Street of a great many Steps. I did not ob&s;erve any Great Hou&s;e belonging to it, their Hou&s;e makes no &s;how, to their &s;orrow. Over the Entrance of the Chappel, on the in&s;ide which is at the <HI>We&s;t,</HI> there are &s;et up above the Or|gan Gallery four Pictures of <HI>Franci&s;cus Borgia;</HI> They are of a Wain&s;coat colour, upon Boards, and the Boards are cut to the &s;hape of the Pictures, they are all at the full length of a Man. At the bottom of each Picture is the Name of the Saint, for they have got him Canoni&s;ed, and to the Name is added an Elo|gium in a word; One is <HI>Franci&s;co Borgiae Ju&s;to;</HI> the other add to his Name the&s;e 3 Epithets a|mong them, <HI>Prudenti, Temperanti, Forti.</HI> I could not ob&s;erve that there was any thing added to the Picture which might be reckon'd a Sym|bol of the Epithet, or Elogium under-written. This Chappel is lighter than that at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> and I believe is much larger, but has not &s;o much finery to &s;how, and looks very naked and plain. The Pillars, which &s;upport the &s;ide Gallerys and the Roof, are very Great ones, and I believe there are 6 on a &s;ide, and tho' they are &s;o big, they &s;eem to be at a good di|&s;tance from one another. There are but few Pictures in the Chappel on the &s;ide I&s;les; Tho&s;e that are there chiefly repre&s;ent &s;ome Saints of their Order, with &s;ome Part of their Story. In one I took notice they have &s;et <HI>Xaverius</HI> &s;it|ting
<PB N="199" REF="115"> upon the ground, as in a Wilderne&s;s, with two or three Leopards about him, and he is handling their Claws, and they fawning upon him. At the bottom of the Picture is an In|&s;cription in <HI>Latin,</HI> &s;ignifying that He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">am'd the Savage Nations by the Faith of Chri&s;t. This <HI>Xaverius</HI> is a great Saint among them; but the &s;cene of his Story is laid a great way off, even in <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Japan:</HI> They call him the A|po&s;tle of the <HI>Indies</HI> and Martyr. He was put to death by the Magi&s;tracy in <HI>Japan;</HI> 'tis like|ly for &s;ome Villany or other, as we have rea|&s;on enough to &s;u&s;pect; becau&s;e we find (as I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to take notice hereafter) that whatever any of this good Order are put to Death for any where, their Brethren make Martyrs of them, and &s;ay they died for the Catholick Faith. The <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> ends of the &s;ide I&s;les have each of them an Altar very finely built up with Marble Pillars, and a good peice of Painting over them. That on the right &s;ide as we look up is dedicated to <HI>Xaverius;</HI> that on the left to <HI>Ignatius Loyola:</HI> Over the for|mer Picture is written in Letters of Gold, <HI>Sancto Xaverio Sacrum;</HI> Over the latter, <HI>Sancto Ignatio Sacrum;</HI> and both, as I remember, leave out the mention of Almighty God. I doubt not but the&s;e Altars are de&s;ign'd more for the Honour of the&s;e Men, than for the Glory of God. The peice of Painting over the high Altar repre&s;ents the Fable of the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgins A&s;|&s;umption. The Altar was at this time dre&s;t ex|travagantly fine, and rich, in appearance: Every thing &s;hin'd with Silver and Gold; In the middle above the Altar, between &s;ix tall Silver Candle&s;ticks &s;tood two Angels, as tall as
<PB N="200" REF="116"> a Child of two years old, which &s;eem'd to be Silver; with a Drapery thrown over the great|e&s;t part of their bodies, which was guilt with Gold. The&s;e put out each of them a hand, with which they &s;upported between them a large Crown: This, too, &s;eem'd to be Silver, and &s;hin'd as if it were &s;et with &s;ome precious Stones: The Angels turn'd their faces inward, and &s;omewhat downward, as looking upon what was under the Crown. There &s;tood un|der it a tall, large Remon&s;tranter with the Ho&s;tie in it, which appear'd through the Cry|&s;tal in the middle of it. Be&s;ides the&s;e things there were &s;et along over the Altar &s;everal o|ther things for Ornament, which were gilt with Silver or Gold, and the&s;e were intermix|ed neatly with great Bundles of Flowers. The Ornament of the Table before, which is com|monly &s;omething very fine, was of Scarlet Vel|vet, with a broad flouri&s;h along the top, and about the ends of it in manner of a Lace, which &s;eem'd to be &s;olid Silver, gilt with Gold. In the middle of the piece, it being now <HI>Whit|&s;unday,</HI> according to the &s;tile of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> there was the Figure of a Dove, which &s;eem'd al&s;o &s;olid Silver, with Raies about it, which were an Embroidery of Gold. The company here at <HI>Compline</HI> was very &s;mall.</P>
<P>The Chappels of other Religious Hou&s;es that we were in were neat, but none of them appear'd very rich or fine. The be&s;t we &s;aw was that of the <HI>Minder Broeders</HI> or <HI>Minorites,</HI> which had a great many Altars, and a good Company of People. Their Quire is very clo&s;e, as is their u&s;ual manner, We went through a dark Alley in the Church, to a door on the &s;ide of it, and
<PB N="201" REF="116"> lookt in: There were a great Company of the Monks a &s;inging their Service. The High Al|tar was very finely adorn'd with Silver Candle|&s;ticks, Flowers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Before an Altar which is <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lio&s;ius.</NOTE> on the left &s;ide as one goes in at the door of the Quire, at the <HI>We&s;t</HI> end of it, which Altar I think is Dedicated to the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> there lies a Tomb-&s;tone, in which in Letters of Bra&s;s is inlaid an In&s;cription in <HI>Latin,</HI> which &s;ignifies, That what remains of <HI>Ju&s;tus Lip&s;ius</HI> on Earth is re|po&s;ited there.</P>
<P><HI>Louvain</HI> has be&s;ides the Churches of Religi|ous Orders but 5 Pari&s;h Churches. A num|ber which would be much too &s;mall for the City, even as 'tis now peopled, if all the People, as they ought to do, did attend the wor&s;hip of God at their re&s;pective Pari&s;hes. But in the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> People run where 'they will to confe&s;s, and to wor&s;hip; and divide them&s;elves between the Secular, and the Regu|lar Clergy: and the Congregations in the Chappels of the Religious Orders are properly &s;o many &s;eparate meetings of People, that for|&s;ake the Bi&s;hop and his Presbyters, and put them&s;elves the name of Religious, as if they were eminently &s;o, and call the other Secular, as if they were men of the common World.</P>
<P>The chief of the&s;e 5 Churches is that of St. <HI>Peter:</HI> It is a Collegiate Church, and enter|tains 18 Chanoines, a Pre&s;ident, and a Dean. It was <HI>Whit &s;unday,</HI> as I have &s;aid with the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> when we were there. And according to Cu&s;tom all the Chanoines, and the Pre&s;idents of the &s;everal Colleges appear'd
<PB N="202" REF="117"> in their greate&s;t finery. Their Copes were very rich, being &s;ome of them Cloath of Silver, or Silver and Gold mixed, and cover'd with rich Em|broideries of Gold and Silver; &s;ome few were of Silk well Embroider'd with Gold and Silver: They were about 40 per&s;ons that were thus dre&s;s'd. They came out of the Quire two and two &s;inging, with two Wax-Tapers burning carried before them, they marched &s;inging out of the Church, but without the Ho&s;t, attended by the Book&s;ellers in their Gowns, who had a little Silver Mace carried before them; they had al&s;o in their train the Principal Magi&s;trates and Officers of the Militia of the Town, and a guard of Souldiers. They went in proce&s;&s;ion round the Church on the out&s;ide, when they came in again they &s;et them&s;elves in two rows along the middle I&s;le and &s;ung a good while. Then they enter'd the Quire and took their &s;eats, and the High Ma&s;s for the day, which was celebrated with Mu&s;ick, begun. This was not celebrated at the High Altar, but at an Alter almo&s;t behind it, at a Chappel in the Pa&s;&s;age round the out&s;ide of the Quire, and was perform'd by the <HI>Capucines,</HI> who are favour'd with a Plenary Indulgence at this time, and which is to be obtain'd here. On the High Altar therefore there &s;tood at this time under an Arch made for it, a Remon&s;tranter with the Wafer in it. This was a tall flouri&s;ht work of the large&s;t &s;ize of any that I had &s;een of the kind, and was very richly gilt with Gold.

<P>On the right &s;ide of the High Altar, under one of the tall Arches which &s;urrounded the Quire &s;tood a &s;ort of a little Steeple of Stone|work; It went up tapering with Pillars and Arches &s;et as in &s;everal Stories one above ano|ther, to the top of the Arch which it &s;tood under. It was in many places gilt upon the Carv'd work of it, and lookt very fine. On the out&s;ide it was encompa&s;s'd with high Bra&s;s bars, to keep People at a little di&s;tance; on the top of them were a great many white Wax ta|pers, which I believe were more than a yard long, and gilt about in rings, but not lighted. I &s;aw many People go to this place, drop down, and &s;ay a Prayer, and then away again; I askt a Town&s;man with us what was within there, for at that time we could not conveniently come near to &s;ee: He told me our Good Lord was there, by which he meant a Con&s;ecrated Wafer; I afterwards had opportunity to go by the place, and &s;aw a little Remon&s;tranter &s;tand|ing in the middle of an Area, at the bottom of that building with a Wafer in the middle of it.

This Son <HI>Charles</HI> was born the &s;econd of <HI>October,</HI> 1538; was made an Abbot at 16 Years of Age. In the Year 1560, when he was yet but 22 Years of Age, his Mothers Brother being by that time Pope under the name afore&s;aid, this Nephew <HI>Charles</HI> was made Cardinal: While he was Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Milain,</HI> in the Year 1576 a terrible plague fell upon the City of <HI>Milain;</HI> which brought with it many other di&s;mal Calamities: He made him&s;elf much belov'd by the People for his Charity to the Sick and Poor at this time, and for the care that he took of them: The Plague did not cea&s;e till the Year 1578: He &s;till continued among his People, vi&s;ited &s;everal that were &s;ick of the Di&s;ea&s;e, yet never was &s;ick of it him&s;elf.

<P>It is evident by this, and many other of their Prayers, that they even equal the Saints to our Saviour in the Office of Mediation.

Sometimes they mention the &s;ufferings of Martyrs, as what they hope &s;hall prevail for them, and even &s;atisfie for their Sins. Which things &s;how how much they differ from true Chri&s;tianity, which, as
<PB N="206" REF="119"> the Apo&s;tle has taught us, acknowledges but one Mediator between God and Man, the Man Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P>At an Altar of the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> in this Church, the&s;e Compliments are given her by In&s;criptions about it: <HI>Sedes Sapientiae,</HI> and again <HI>Virgo Maria Illuminatrix.</HI> Let it be judg'd whether the&s;e are not Attributes that &s;ignifie &s;omething may be expected from the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> her &s;elf, and that it is not true what the explaining People of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> pre|tend, That they only pray to the Saints to pray for them. When the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> is call'd the <HI>Seat of Wi&s;dom,</HI> and an <HI>Inlightner,</HI> would not any one who believes this of her think that he might expect Wi&s;dom and Illumination from her? And when a Saint is call'd a Patron in &s;uch and &s;uch particular Ca&s;es, the People are led to under&s;tand that 'tis the Saint that helps in &s;uch ca&s;es by vertue of a Power given him from Almighty God. For if praying and in|terceding be all their bu&s;ine&s;s, one Saint may pray for any thing as well as another.</P>
<P>In this Church there is an Altar dedicated to the Holy Trinity, as an In&s;cription tells us in the&s;e words, <HI>Deo Triuno Sacrum.</HI> The Altar|peice is a Picture, &s;uch as they u&s;ually make, for the di&s;honourable, and Impious Repre&s;enta|tion of the H.

<P>ON <HI>Whitmonday,</HI> according to the <HI>Roman</HI> &s;tile, we took our places in a <HI>Charrette</HI> that was bound for <HI>Mae&s;tricht.</HI> We were in all 6 or 8 Per&s;ons in the <HI>Charrette,</HI> and were drawn by 3 Hor&s;es: We paid each per&s;on, for this pa&s;&s;age, two Pattacoons at 48 Stivers each, which came to 9 Guilders 12 Stivers for two of us. We began our Journey about 11 a Clock before Noon, went through a great part of the City, and out at the <HI>Thienen Port:</HI> &s;o we left <HI>Park Abby</HI> a little on our left hand. This is a Hou&s;e belonging to the Order of the <HI>Premon&s;traten&s;es,</HI> who were taken notice of before at <HI>Antwerp.</HI> The place &s;till retains the Name it had before it was taken to this U&s;e. The Hou&s;e &s;tands in a Park, a place made very plea&s;ant by a little Wood near it, and fine Fi&s;h-ponds, a little Brook, and curious Meadows. This account is given of the place, and tho' we could not &s;ee it, I think fit to mention it becau&s;e this Hou&s;e has been Ho|nour'd with the Pre&s;ence of our King, who &s;everal times lodg'd here during the late War.</P>
<P>Through all this Journey to <HI>Mae&s;tricht</HI> we often &s;aw the mi&s;erable Effects of War: A Country of a rich and Arable Soil fit to bear Corn, but much of it untill'd: Many Hou&s;es ruin'd, and others made uninhabitable: And it &s;eem'd to me that the Country is. much ex|hau&s;ted of its People. It may be &s;uppo&s;ed
<PB N="210" REF="121"> that during the War many were forced into the Armies on one &s;ide and the other, and in them de&s;troy'd; and many of the People might be fled into other Countries for the &s;afety of their Lives, and be &s;till begging or working there for their lively-hood. This Country is generally open Champion Coun|try, and but too Commodious for the march|ing of Armies, as the poor Inhabitants have had rea&s;on to think.</P>
<P>About the middle of this Days Journey we came to <HI>Thienen</HI> or <HI>Tilmont;</HI> which is a little <NOTE PLACE="marg">Thienen.</NOTE> City &s;cituate upon the River <HI>Gheet.</HI> This C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ty, to go round it by the Wall, is, they &s;ay, about a Mile in compa&s;s: The Wall &s;eem'd at pre|&s;ent but in a ruinous condition, we al&s;o &s;aw many Ruines within, and many Hou&s;es almo&s;t &s;o. The River runs through this City, they &s;ay, under 12 Bridges. There are 7 di&s;tinct Markets, that is, Market-places, for &s;everal things, according to the manner of this Coun|try; and the City &s;tands in a rich fruitful Country which is able to afford it all things nece&s;&s;ary to Humane Life. It has been for|merly a City of Great Trade, and was the Head City of one of the Quarters of <HI>Brabant;</HI> but that dignity has been long transferr'd from hence to <HI>Hertogen-bo&s;ch,</HI> and now this City is within that Quarter, which acknowledges <HI>Louvain</HI> for Head of it. There are two Churches ob&s;ervable in it, which are Stately and Magnificent buildings, the only remain|ing &s;igns perhaps of its former Grandure. One is dedicated to the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> which &s;tands upon a very wide open place: It is
<PB N="211" REF="121"> not fine within, for without doubt the City is but poor. There had been a Proce&s;&s;ion on that day, or perhaps on <HI>Whit&s;unday,</HI> wherein had been carried the Image of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> and that of a Bi&s;hop, whom I &s;uppo&s;e to be St. <HI>Germain.</HI> The&s;e Images &s;tood in the Church, on the things by which they carry them on mens &s;houlders. They were but little Images, but dre&s;s'd very fine; their upper Garments were both the &s;ame, of Scar|let-Sattin, with many and large flowers of Gold wove in with it: By their &s;tanding &s;till in the Church, I concluded they were to be carried again on &s;ome other day of the Octave, which is that they &s;ometimes do. I went al&s;o into the Church of St. <HI>Germain,</HI> who is &s;aid to have been Bi&s;hop of <HI>Paris.</HI> Here is a Quire wherein they were &s;inging Ve&s;pers, it &s;eem'd very naked and mean with|in. At &s;ome of the Altars in the other part of the Church, the Ornament &s;et before them, was good fre&s;h Silk, with large and frequent Gold Flowers upon it. We &s;taid here but an Hour, went through the City; pa&s;&s;ing by the end of one Street we &s;aw it wide, and the Hou&s;es in a pretty good condition, but tho&s;e in our way were all very mi&s;erable</P>

This Chappel has an Image of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> call'd <HI>Notredame de Pierre,</HI> or <HI>Our Lady of the Stone,</HI> which is in great Vene|ration and E&s;teem with the People of this Country: our Hone&s;t foreman rode by it with his Hat in his lap for a good way together.
<PB N="212" REF="122"> As we were pa&s;&s;ing, our Company all con|curr'd in giving us this following account of this Image.

They told us, &s;he grows almo&s;t an Inch in height every Year, and then they did well not to &s;ay when &s;he was fir&s;t found; for at that rate of growing, if &s;he had been long there, the little Chappel would not have held her.</P>
<P>To this Image, People come for relief again&s;t the Stone or Gravel, and in time of Peace this Chappel is much frequented, e&s;pecially upon particular Days, at which times I &s;up|po&s;e &s;ome Indulgences are the Lure to draw People to it. They told us, that on <HI>Ea&s;ter Monday</HI> la&s;t, the Country now being quiet, there were reckon'd 7000 People, who came to pay their Devotions here. This &s;illy Story was told us, with a great deal of gravity and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, and we, to encourage them to give us &s;uch accounts of things as we pa&s;s'd, re|ceiv'd it with as much gravity, and &s;eeming admiration: Upon which a good Man in the Company, who came from <HI>Berg</HI> St. <HI>Winoc,</HI> and was going to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">aths of <HI>Aix,</HI> told us, They have at <HI>Bullen</HI> an Image of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> which came thither in a Ship alone.</P>

<PB N="213" REF="122"> &s;he is the Mother, &s;he cannot fail: intimating that which 'tis without doubt the People ge|nerally imagine, that &s;he as a Mother may &s;till pretend to have &s;ome Authority and Regard with our Saviour: Indeed they mu&s;t needs be betray'd into this Opinion, by the extravagant Prerogatives which are given to the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> in the Devotions to her, which the Prie&s;ts teach them, and by &s;eeing our Saviour for the mo&s;t part repre&s;ented as a Child in her Arms: As if he were &s;till in a condition of &s;ubjection to Her; who is now po&s;&s;e&s;t of all power in Heaven and Earth, and is Head over all things.</P>
<P>But by the e&s;teem of this Image, it is ea&s;ie to judge whether the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> reckons there is any Vertue in Images or not; and whether or no the Papi&s;ts put any tru&s;t in them. Can it be &s;aid they believe there is no vertue in this Image, when they pretend it Cures the Stone? And do they put no tru&s;t in it, who come an hundred Mile perhaps to this place, in hopes to be Cur'd here of this Di|&s;temper? And can we find any In&s;tances of Veneration paid by the <HI>Heathens</HI> to their Images, beyond what is practi&s;ed and taught in the Church of <HI>Rome</HI>? The Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Mechlin</HI> in his Pa&s;toral Letter directs; That the Images of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> e&s;pecially tho&s;e that are famous for Miracles &s;hould be frequented; that they be carried about, after the manner of our Ance&s;tours, &s;ays he, in publick Proce&s;&s;ions, that they be illu&s;trated with lighted Flambeaus, and honour'd with &s;tated Eauds, Litanies and Pray|ers.

<P>After about two hours Travel more, we came <NOTE PLACE="marg">Leeuwe.</NOTE> to another little City call'd <HI>Leeuwe.</HI> We went, to this for a good way upon an old broken pitch'd Cau&s;e-way. The ground about this City is flat and low: At a di&s;tance the Meadows &s;eem very wet and &s;oft, which is the rea&s;on of this made way; but as we came nearer the City the wet &s;eem'd to encrea&s;e, and about the City there &s;eems to be a perfect Mora&s;s or Bog. There were &s;ome out-works, &s;et here and there upon &s;ome dry &s;pots in it. We found the Gates ruin'd, the Walls in a very ruinous condition, and many heaps of Rubbi&s;h about in the Town within. It is now, whatever it may have been formerly, a very wretch'd place. This City is within the Quarter of <HI>Louvain,</HI> but ju&s;t upon the Borders of it; for &s;oon after we were gone from this place we entred upon the Dominions of the Prince of <HI>Leige.</HI> There was a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Gari&s;on now in the Town; who had deckt their Guard hou&s;e with Boughs, and hung their Colours out at the Windows: We found al&s;o the Streets &s;trow'd with fre&s;h Greens; which things were the &s;igns of a Proce&s;&s;ion that had been there this Day. A good big Bell was calling People to Church, and they were ha&s;tening to catch I &s;uppo&s;e the Benediction at <HI>Compline.</HI> We did not alight nor &s;top here. When we were out of the City we pa&s;t by a pretty large Lake, which was on our left hand, at a little di&s;tance from us, and lies very near the Walls of the City on that &s;ide.</P>
<P>Near this City, at the di&s;tance of about two Hours, was fought the famous Battle of <HI>Landen;</HI> in the Year 1693, in which <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> General, in his la&s;t Campaign, won the Field,

<P>About an Hour after we left <HI>Leeuwe,</HI> we came <NOTE PLACE="marg">St. <HI>Tryden.</HI></NOTE> to St. <HI>Truyden,</HI> which was to be our re&s;ting place for this night.

This perhaps may be the oc|ca&s;ion of the corrupted name, which &s;ome in late times have given to this City, calling it St. <HI>Tron.</HI> The name of St. <HI>Truyden</HI> it has from the Mona&s;tery of St. <HI>Trudo,</HI> which is here.

<P>THIS City call'd in Latin, <HI>Trajectum ad Mo&s;am,</HI> in the Language of the Country <HI>Mae&s;tricht,</HI> deriv'd its name undoubtedly from hence; that this was a common place of Pa&s;&s;age over the <HI>Mae&s;e.</HI> It &s;tands upon this great River, which is here, much wider than the breadth of the <HI>Thames</HI> at <HI>London;</HI> and of a depth &s;ufficient to bring up loaded Ve&s;&s;els of a good Burden.

<P>This City is &s;eated within the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Leige,</HI> but is with &s;ome compa&s;s about it reckon'd a part of <HI>Brabant,</HI> and as &s;uch did formerly be|long to the Dukes of <HI>Brabant,</HI> who divided it with the Bi&s;hop and Prince of <HI>Leige.</HI> The ground and occa&s;ion of this odd divi&s;ion is this. <HI>Porus</HI> Count of <HI>Louvain</HI> gave part of this City to St. <HI>Servatius,</HI> when he was Bi&s;hop of it, to be held with &s;ome acknowledgment of the Gift: for it was He, as hath been &s;aid, who transferr'd the Epi&s;copal Seat from <HI>Tongeren</HI> hither, after he had been In&s;trumental to Convert the People here to the Chri&s;tian Faith. When, after this, the See was transfer'd to <HI>Leige,</HI> the right which the Bi&s;hop had when he re&s;ided here was rec|kon'd to belong to him when he was re|mov'd to <HI>Leige,</HI> and does &s;o &s;till. But now the Dominion of the City is divided between the States General of the <HI>United Provinces</HI> and the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Leige:</HI> the former being in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the rights of the Duke of <HI>Brabant.</HI> This double Juri&s;diction is &s;till continued in the City, and as formerly, without any di&s;tinction by bounds or limits; &s;o that the Subjects of one and the other Government lie intermix'd about the City. In the &s;ame Street there are Subjects to the different Governments. A cu&s;tom has been formerly ob&s;erv'd, and I think is &s;till here:
<PB N="222" REF="127"> That if &agrave; Man who is a Subject of one Govern|ment takes a Wife that is a Subject of the other, His Children by her mu&s;t all be Subjects to that Government that &s;he was under.

There are two di&s;tinct Burgoma&s;ters in the City, and other Magi&s;trates to govern the di&s;tinct People: but in common concerns of the City, they meet and join together in determining matters. The Duke of <HI>Brabant</HI> was, notwith&s;tanding this Sate of the City, reckon'd the chief Soveraign of it, and at pre&s;ent the States General &s;eem to have the greate&s;t power here. There was now a great Garri&s;on in the Town, con&s;i&s;ting of Ten Thou&s;and Men, which we were told were all in the States pay: They then, by con&s;equence, have the Command of the Gates, the Fortifi|cations and the Amunition. This City is ex|treamly well fortified; be&s;ides a &s;trong Wall, and a broad deep Ditch, there are &s;everal Ba|&s;tions round it, which are well planted with Cannon; there are al&s;o many &s;trong out-works, with cover'd ways to them, and all the&s;e are provided of Mines ready made.

<P>The Hill before mention'd on the <HI>South-Ea&s;t</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Quarries.</NOTE> &s;ide of this City, yeilds a very plea&s;ant pro&s;pect to it in time of Peace, and when they expect no mi&s;chief from thence. It is all cover'd with a good Mold, and full of Enclo&s;ures, which are Plough'd and Sown, and veild very good Grain. The in&s;ide of this Hill is a Free-&s;tone, in which are a multitude of Caverns, out of which they have dug Stone, and pa&s;&s;ages wide enough for for Carts to come in and fetch it thence. The Stone is white with a little yellowi&s;hne&s;s: 'tis in the Quarry &s;o &s;oft, that I could make an Im|pre&s;&s;ion on it ea&s;ily with the end of my Cane; but when it is out it hardens and bears the Weather very well. We went to &s;ee this place which they call the <HI>Quarries;</HI> We took a Guide from one of the hou&s;es at the bottom of the Hill, who furni&s;ht him&s;elf with a Candle, and &s;everal Matches, and a good piece of Touch-wood fir'd. We mounted about a third part of the height of the Hill, and then at a Cart way went into it; when we were in, our Guide lighted his Candle. We ob&s;erv'd there were &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages which run from the way in which we went, and in many places we &s;aw great Caverns out of which the Stone had been dug; we had a good big Candle, yet the light of it did not reach the &s;ides of them, tho' they are whiti&s;h too. He led us to one place where a round hole is cut for the Air, down into the Quarry; we had a&s;cended con&s;iderably within the Quarry, and this hole did not come
<PB N="227" REF="129"> down from the highe&s;t part of the Hill, yet I believe it was of the depth of 3 or 4 good Stories. The roof is every where dug in an Arch. There are &s;o many pa&s;&s;ages and ways and wide Ca|verns here dug into the Rock, that I believe if our Candle had gone out, and we could not have lighted it again, it would have been hard for our Guide, tho' well acquainted with the place, to have led us out. He brought usto a place within the Hill where there is &s;ome Wa|ter; but how it comes there I could not be in|form'd; he call'd it the <HI>Put,</HI> which is <HI>Dutch</HI> for a Well. A Wall was built up before it almo&s;t to the top of the Cavity which is here, as high as a good lofty Ceiling, &s;o we could not &s;ee the manner of it: But he convinced us there was Water within, by throwing a piece of a Stone over the Wall; this he did &s;everal times, the Stones &s;truck dry fir&s;t and then quickly fell in|to Water. I imagine this to be a Cavity in the Rock, to which the Rain water that &s;oaks through the Mold is gather'd. He could not tell me whether it was a running Water or not, and I li&s;tned, but could hear no noi&s;e of any motion it had: be&s;ides I judge it has no motion by the name they gave it; for if it had been a &s;ubterraneous Stream, they would have call'd it the <HI>Stroom,</HI> or the <HI>Beeck,</HI> not a <HI>Put</HI> or Well. Sometimes we climb'd up by notches in the Rock, out of which they had hewn Stone a good way, and &s;ometimes we de&s;cended by &s;uch notches. When we had walked about half an hour under ground, and were told there was nothing to be &s;een more, but &s;uch as we had &s;een, we de&s;ir'd to be led out. He brought us after a little while to another Cart-way, out at the &s;ide of the Hill, which I believe was a|bout
<PB N="228" REF="130"> another third part higher than that we enter'd at. This Hill by Vertue of this Stone is a great advantage to <HI>Mae&s;tricht,</HI> for they u&s;e it much in Building them&s;elves, and by the help of the River they convey it to their Neighbours.</P>

We were told it would be a pa&s;&s;age of about 5 Hours: but we went off before ten in the Morning, and came not to <HI>Leige</HI> till 7 in the Evening.

We were drawn by 5 Hor&s;es fa&s;tned at the end of a very long Rope; I believe we had for the mo&s;t part about an hundred People on Board. But all the way at &s;everal places we had &s;ome delays by &s;ome People going off, and others coming on. We had a Sail &s;et up, but it help'd us little, becau&s;e there was very little wind.</P>
<P>The Mountain in which were the Quarries
<PB N="229" REF="130"> that we were in runs to the <HI>Mae&s;e,</HI> and butts upon it with a precipice for a great way toge|ther, and we were clo&s;e under it as we went up, our Hor&s;es going on the brink of the River at the foot of it. I could ob&s;erve here the man|ner how the Stone lies in it. I &s;aw it was di&s;|po&s;ed in layings one over another of very dif|ferent thickne&s;&s;es; one laying which was about the middle of the height, as I remember, was I believe 5 or 6 feet in thickne&s;s, &s;ome others not above two. The layings of the Free|&s;tone were &s;eperated from one another, by a laying of Flints which run all along between them, of the thickne&s;s I &s;uppo&s;e of 4 or 5 Inches, commonly. After we had gone for &s;ome hours by this Mountain, it left the River and turn'd up into he Country, but continu'd, and ap|pear'd there very high, with a gradual a&s;cent, and cloath'd with green Downs fit for Sheep. It left a rich plain between it and the River of different breadths. As far as the Mountain on that &s;ide of us run by the River, the other &s;ide was a Flatt, and we could &s;ee no ri&s;ing ground but at a great di&s;tance from the River, be|yond the reach of a di&s;tinct View. After|wards when we came to have a flat ground on the right &s;ide of us as we went up, we had a ri&s;ing ground on the other, the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> &s;ide of the River; this-began I think about <HI>Vi&s;et</HI> or <HI>We&s;et,</HI> and continued all the way up from thence. Sometimes the Hills ri&s;e gradually to a great height, and &s;how'd rich enclo&s;ed grounds, a great many, one above another, in a mixture of Corn fields, Orchards, and Pa&s;ture-Grounds. Sometimes the Hill &s;tood up very high, with a precipice almo&s;t hanging over the Water: here appear'd a Rock of a &s;ort of Marble; it is
<PB N="230" REF="131"> a very hard Stone, of a deep blew colour, and will poli&s;h very &s;mooth; there is much of it in this Country, and much is u&s;ed for Stairs or Pavements, where it never wears, as well as for other parts of buildings. Sometimes where the Hill was very high and &s;teep, it was yet cover'd with mold, and that all Planted with Vineyards from the top almo&s;t to the bottom; the&s;e were new dre&s;s'd and &s;tuck all over with the little Stakes which the Wires of the Vines were to lay hold on, and &s;o to hold up the Grapes a little from the Ground. There are a great many of the&s;e Vineyards in the way, and a|bout <HI>Leige</HI> it &s;elf. This had been an extream plea&s;ant pa&s;&s;age if we could have been &s;ure of good weather, and could have &s;tood in the open part of the Boat; for we had but little Windows in the Roof to look out at.</P>

<P>THIS City, call'd in <HI>Latin, Legia, Leodi|um,</HI> and <HI>Leodium;</HI> in <HI>Dutch, Luyck,</HI> and by the <HI>French Liege,</HI> is Head of a large Bi&s;hop|rick and Principality; which is reckon'd a part of the Empire, included within the Circle of <HI>We&s;tphalia.</HI> It lies along the <HI>Mae&s;e</HI> for the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bi&s;hoprick of</HI> Leige.</NOTE> mo&s;t part, and on both the &s;ides of it.

We ob&s;erved both here, and at <HI>Mae&s;tricht,</HI> and at <HI>Aix la Chapelle,</HI> a frugality in the u&s;e of this Coal, which &s;eems worth taking notice of. The mo&s;t of it is in great peices, it being as it were hewn out of a Rock: but in the working of the&s;e out, and in the removing them from place to place, there will be a great deal of Coal du&s;t made. This du&s;t they carefully pre&s;erve, and u&s;e it thus. They take a certain &s;ort of a fat Clay, which looks &s;omewhat of the colour of brick Earth, and make it into a Morter, working it with a convenient quantity of Wa|ter: being thus prepar'd, they mingle the Coal|du&s;t with it, as much as it will receive, and work the whole Ma&s;s well together. When they have done &s;o, they with their hands make up the mingled &s;tuff into Oval balls, &s;omewhat le&s;&s;er than Bricks. The&s;e they lay to dry and harden, and then they burn them. They &s;eem to take fire but &s;lowly, and to need, for this, the mixture of &s;ome of the pure Coal among them, but when they are well kindled they give a great heat, and they hold fire a long time: They look of the colour of Bricks when

At <HI>Aix la Chapelle,</HI> we ob&s;erv'd they &s;tuck this &s;tuff up again&s;t the Wall in Cakes to dry there, and there it would &s;tick very fa&s;t, till they beat it down for their u&s;e.

The River makes here a very &s;hort turn in two Channels: One of which, and the le&s;&s;er of the two, compa&s;&s;es a good large I&s;land, which is all built, and mu&s;t be accounted part of the City, to which it is join'd by &s;everal Bridges. The bigger Channel of the <HI>Mae&s;e</HI> turns &s;hort of the other, and runs between this I&s;land and the place call'd the <HI>Wyke,</HI> another part of the City which lies on the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> &s;ide of the <HI>Mae&s;e:</HI> It is a large place well built, containing &s;everal Streets, and &s;eem'd to have its proportion of Trade with the re&s;t of the City; to which it is join'd by a good Stone Bridge cro&s;s the <HI>Mae&s;e,</HI> which has 6 Arches under it.

The Streets of the City have no beauty, they are very narrow, and few of them &s;trait; the buildings are much like the Old City of <HI>London.</HI> They are commonly 3 or 4 Stories in height, but tho&s;e Stories are not very high ones.

<P>We went up a very long Street, and a &s;teep Hill to the Cittadel which &s;tands above the whole City: Where having ask'd leave of the Corporal, who was then in Duty there, we were permitted to walk upon the brow of the Hill, which overlooks the whole City, and views the Country for a good way about, upwards and down the River.

The &s;ides of the Hills cover'd with Vineyards, the tops with Corn Fields; the lower grounds were divided between Meadows, Hop-grounds, of which we &s;aw many, and Orchards and Gardens; we &s;ee all this intermixed with many Hou&s;es, and &s;ome little Villages; it is certain|ly one of the mo&s;t various and delightful pro&s;pects that which we had here: VVe lookt down from hence over the tops of the Steeples in the City. If our time, and the fear of Rain would have permitted, we could wil|lingly have &s;taid a great while here. We went down from hence into the City ano|ther way, on purpo&s;e to go through a Vine|yard, which we &s;aw below us, to ob&s;erve &s;omething of the manner of &s;uch a thing which was new to us, and went down a very &s;teep de&s;cent by it, which was made &s;ome|thing the more ea&s;ie by &s;teps of Stone laid

After they that &s;how'd it had taken away from above the Altar at each end a Silk Curtain, and behind that two boards, there appear'd two things in Silver which were wrought into the form of a Church; they were &s;et one over another, and &s;eem'd to be all the four about 3 Feet long, and a Foot and half in height. One of them had a blew Enamel (as I &s;uppo&s;e, for we kept with other Viewers a due di&s;tance) in &s;everal Partitions upon it: They did not &s;tir the&s;e from the Places,

There were three Men about the &s;howing of the&s;e, one with a Surplice on, and the other two in Scar|let Gowns, &s;uch as they wear when they at|tend at Divine Service. Some People be&s;ides us, that &s;aw them fell upon their Knees at the appearance of the two fir&s;t Pieces, and conti|nued &s;o till the la&s;t were &s;hown, and all were cover'd again.

<P>We went into the Church of St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> which is on the great Market-place at the time of Compline. There hung up about the Church many Coats of Arms painted upon little Woo|den Shields: Under one was written, with a Name, the&s;e words, <HI>Pa&s;tor hujus Paroechiae;</HI> un|der another, with a Name, <HI>Captain of this Pa|ri&s;h,</HI> under another, <HI>Lieutenant of this Pari&s;h.</HI> There is a great deal of Marble in this Church about the Altar Pieces, and well poli&s;ht, of curious &s;orts, and very hand&s;omely built up, and much of the flower'd Work of it was guilt with Gold. The High Altar of the Church was very fine|ly adorn'd, we could not conveniently go up near enough to &s;ee what the Painting over it contain'd. At the top of the Work about it, and near the top of the Church was &s;et up a very large Canopy of Scarlet Velvet, as I re|member, with a Gold-galoon up on the Seams, and a deep Gold-fringe round at the lower edge of it. In the middle of this was an Em|broidery of Silver to repre&s;ent a Dove, with Raies of Gold embroider'd all about as darting
<PB N="242" REF="137"> from it. This was put up for the &s;ake of <HI>Whit|&s;ontide;</HI> we &s;aw in &s;ome other Places the like thing upon this Occa&s;ion. The Ornaments be|fore the Altars here were very rich, being of Scarlet, and other colour'd Silks, with many broad Gold-flowers upon them, and &s;ome of them had a deep Gold-fringe laid acro&s;s from one end to the other, about a Foot di&s;tant from the top, according to the u&s;ual manner. At the Ea&s;t end of the North I&s;le, was an Altar which had over it a piece of Painting, that I &s;hall take notice of. In the upper part of it, there is &s;et their common, ab&s;urd, and impious Repre|&s;entation of the Holy Trinity; towards the middle of the Piece is the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> repre|&s;ented as looking up to the Per&s;ons above, and pointing downwards: Below her is an Angel, looking I think towards her as to receive her Directions, and reaching downwards; under him are a Company of People making grievous Faces, and in the mid&s;t of Flames, the Angel has hold of one, and is hawling him out, and the re&s;t are holding up their hands towards him, as de&s;iring to be lifted out likewi&s;e. A delicate Fiction, fit for Poets or Painters, who, as <HI>Horace</HI> &s;ays, have a <HI>Pote&s;tas quidlibet audendi:</HI> but which ought not to be put upon People by the Teachers of Chri&s;tianity as an Article of Faith. Here they are taught the In|vention of Purgatory, and to look upon the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin as the chief Mediatrix, and In|terceder for the Souls there. And the&s;e things they are likely to be taught, for the Gain and Advantage which the Pope and Roman Clergy derive from them, till the Spirit of Truth &s;hall prevail in them above the Love of the world.</P>

<P>The Engli&s;h Je&s;uites have their Hou&s;e in <NOTE PLACE="marg">Je&s;uites.</NOTE> &s;ome of the highe&s;t Ground in the City; it certainly &s;tands very ai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">y, and plea&s;ant, and healthy. As we went up to it, we mounted through one Street which is pav'd in the man|ner of Steps; the&s;e Steps were about Two or Three Feet broad, and Three or Four Inches high: Thus we climb'd a great way; at length we came to their Hou&s;e. When we left the Street we had &s;till an a&s;cent of I believe Sixty Stone Steps to mount to the Door of the Col|lege; the&s;e Steps were of the common hard blue Stone of this Country, and I believe each of them a Foot in height. We were ci|villy, and ea&s;ily admitted, upon &s;aying only that we were Engli&s;hmen, come out of Curi|o&s;ity to &s;ee the Country. After a little wait|ing, we were conducted into the Garden, which Mounts &s;till far above the Hou&s;e. It con&s;i&s;ts of Five Area's, or Plots, one con&s;iderably a|bove another, on the &s;ide of the Hill. The Area's them&s;elves lie in a little De&s;cent, and from one to another above it we had &s;everal Steps to a&s;cend. I doubt not but to the uppermo&s;t Area, from the Door of the Col|lege, the height mu&s;t be at lea&s;t an Hundred Feet. Over a Stone Portal, which enter'd the &s;econd Area, were the Arms of a Prince and Bi&s;hop of <HI>Liege,</HI> as I judged, with this In|&s;cription by it&punc; <HI>Maximiliano Electori Fundatori.</HI> Other Di&s;cour&s;e, as we were going up, made me forget to ask the Je&s;uite with us concer|ning this. In one Garden they had &s;everal very ingenious Sun-dails. One he call'd the blind Man's Dial; becau&s;e a blind Man having once learnt the order of the Numbers at the
<PB N="242" REF="138"> end of the Lines, might by feeling find what time of the Day it is, thus: The Hour Lines, at which the Figures were &s;et, were little flat Bars of Iron; and a Gla&s;s Globe full of Wa|ter was &s;o &s;et between it and the Sun, as to con|tract the burning Point &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, according to the Sun's Motion upon the&s;e Lines; this bur|ning Point would be &s;en&s;ible to his Finger, and he would thereby know the time of the Day. In a Concave-Dial, which had Vines laid over it to make the Shadow, and the Hour Lines meeting all in one Centre, they had &s;et a little Picture of our Saviour, with his Finger at that Centre, and a Motto, as proceeding from him, in the&s;e Words, <HI>Haec est Hora tua.</HI> At the top of the highe&s;t Area they have a &s;mall flat Bowling-Ally for Exerci&s;e, and if that be thought too little to exerci&s;e ones &s;elf much in it, we may judge that the getting up to it &s;up|plies all that Defect. By this is a Building of Two Stories in height, with Three Rooms in it. From the uppermo&s;t of the&s;e they have a very fine Pro&s;pect, being now lifted, I think, above any part of the City. We &s;aw from hence the Mona&s;tery of the Carthu&s;ians, on the top of a neighbouring Hill, where the Mar|&s;hal <HI>Boufflers</HI> planted his Mortars to Bombard this City. As we came down we enter'd the Hou&s;e again from the &s;econd Area of the Gar|den. We went through a large Room where they hold their Di&s;putes; and from thence in|to the Library, which is a long narrow Room, like a Gallery. It was well fill'd with Books, which look'd as if they were well u&s;ed, and &s;tudied: I may &s;ay of their Library, it is ra|ther u&s;eful than fine. Over &s;everal Partitions
<PB N="243" REF="138"> of Shelves there was written at the top of the Room, <HI>Libri Theologici, Libri Juridici, Libri Medici, Libri Mathematict,</HI> &amp;c. Two Divi&s;ions had a little Lattice over them, and they were lock'd up. Over the&s;e was this Title, <HI>Libri Prohibiti.</HI> Among the&s;e, I could ob&s;erve, was <HI>Cornelij Jan|&s;enij Augu&s;tinus,</HI> &s;ome of the Works of the German Reformers, the <HI>Novum Te&s;tamentum Gallicum,</HI> which I &s;uppo&s;e is that call'd the <HI>Mons</HI> Te&s;tament. I could not &s;ee the Name of any Engli&s;h Divine among the&s;e; but on the back of one of the Pri&s;oners there was pa&s;ted a Paper, on which was written the Word <HI>Sermons,</HI> this was a thin Folio. He &s;how'd us here a large and good Load&s;tone; and a String of Ten Beads, with a Cro&s;s, which &s;eem'd to be all Amethy&s;ts; this he &s;aid was the Dizaine of <HI>Mary</HI> Queen of Scots, when &s;he died in <HI>England,</HI> which &s;he had been wont to u&s;e in reciting her Ro&s;ary. He had al&s;o a little Book of Prayers, cover'd with Velvet; it was a Manu&s;cript, curiou&s;ly written upon Vellum, and had in it &s;ome very pretty Mini|ature; this, too, he &s;aid had been hers. They may well Venerate the Memory of that Un|fortunate Lady, who&s;e Zeal for them, by their Conduct of it, betray'd her to her Death. He &s;how'd us a Cylinder Looking-Gla&s;s, which was to reduce Figures which &s;eem &s;hapele&s;s and confus'd, into Shape and Order. According|ly, it being &s;et upon Two Board; which he produc'd, it reflected the Scrawls of one into a Picture of our Saviour, as tied to a Pillar to be &s;courg'd, and crown'd with Thorns. The other, when reflected from the Gla&s;s, appear'd to be a <HI>George</HI> on Hor&s;eback, with the Dragon
<PB N="244" REF="139"> under him: He &s;aid this was St. <HI>George</HI> for <HI>Eng|land.</HI> At one end of the Library is a piece of Jack-work made for that &s;ort of Machine with which <HI>Archimedes</HI> pretended to remove the whole Earth out of its Place, if he had but another Place where he could fix his In&s;tru|ment. It held I believe an Hundred Pound weight from the Ground, which was drawn about half way up. There were not many Wheels belonging to it, but I believe the Teeth of all, or mo&s;t of them, were &s;et &s;loping; they were pretty large Wheels, and each of them catch'd in a Worm which was laid round the Axis of the next Wheel. The Winder might be turn'd by a little Child, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">t went &s;o ea&s;ie, but the effect of the Machine is mighty &s;low. A Pin was &s;tuck upon the top of the Cylinder, on which the Weight hung,. and af|ter a great many turns of the Winder, it ap|pear'd, but very little mov'd. We &s;aw here al|&s;o a Book of a &s;mall Quarto &s;ize, with I believe about Forty Leaves in it, or more, of Chi|ne&s;s Writing: It was a large black Character, but made very di&s;tinct and clear. Some of the Characters had about them a great many Lines, and &s;ome Points. I &s;uppo&s;e each Cha|racter &s;tood for a Word, for they were &s;et equally di&s;tant from one another. They were extreamly various, yet &s;ome we could ob&s;erve were often repeated. The Lines went from the top to the bottom of the Leaf; and be|tween every Two Lines of Characters there was drawn a &s;mall Line of Ink. The Pa|per was very thin, &s;omewhat browni&s;h, &s;oft as Silk. The Characters, though very black, and written on both &s;ides the Leaf, did not
<PB N="245" REF="139"> confound one another. He &s;aid, that none of their Fellows in this Hou&s;e could under&s;tand it; I was &s;orry that I could not.

<P>WE had found the Pa&s;&s;age up the <HI>Mae&s;e</HI> &s;o tedious in coming up hither, and knew the River to be &s;till extreamly &s;well'd by more Rain, that we laid a&s;ide the Thoughts of going to <HI>Namur,</HI> and re&s;olv'd to cro&s;s the Country to <HI>Colen,</HI> and in our way to &s;ee <HI>Aix la Chapelle.</HI> There are no fixed Carriages here for <HI>Aix,</HI> tho' this was the time of Concour&s;e to tho&s;e Baths. We were directed to the Water-&s;ide, near the Bridge to the Wyke, where there &s;tand Fore|men ready to be hired, who are notorious by their blue Frocks. We found, if we would have a Charrette for us two, the lowe&s;t Price mu&s;t be three Pattacoons, which is four Guil|ders, four Stivers; but if we had any Com|pany, tho' it were but one Per&s;on more, we might go for a Pattacoon each Per&s;on; and this was the lowe&s;t Price for each that would be taken, if the Company were more. If the Company does not exceed four Per&s;ons, they will put but one Hor&s;e in the Charrette; if
<PB N="247" REF="140"> there be &s;ix, they will put in two; if eight Per&s;ons, three Hor&s;es, and &s;o many is the mo&s;t the&s;e Chariots will hold. Our Foreman or Charioteer had mu&s;ter'd together &s;ix Per&s;ons, and &s;o put into the Chariot two good &s;tout Hor&s;es.</P>
<P>We left <HI>Liege</HI> about &s;even a Clock in the Morning, and travel'd the fir&s;t two Hours in a Valley full of Villages and Hou&s;es along the way, on the &s;ame &s;ide of the River that <HI>Liege</HI> mo&s;tly &s;tands on, that is the We&s;t &s;ide. This Valley was not very broad between the River and the Hills. The Hills were planted with Vineyards, and the Valley had abundance of Hop-grounds and great Orchards in it, and Gardens, and fields, and Pa&s;ture-grounds; every thing look'd as if the Soil were very rich and good. About an Hour after we came from <HI>Liege,</HI> we were in with a large &s;cattering Village call'd <HI>Herstal.</HI> A Burgher of <HI>Liege,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Her&s;tal.</NOTE> in our Company, told us that the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> our King, is Owner of this Place, and that he has lately given the People leave, upon their Reque&s;t, to build them a Town-Hou&s;e. This Town lies upon the <HI>Mae&s;e,</HI> and may conveniently manage &s;ome Trade. This Place was famous in the Hi&s;tory of <HI>France,</HI> under the &s;econd Race of their Kings. It has been call'd by &s;ome <HI>Heri&s;tel,</HI> by others <HI>Heri|&s;tal.</HI> It is from hence that <HI>Pepin,</HI> Ma&s;ter of the Palace, and Father of <HI>Charles Martel,</HI> a Prince of the <HI>Franks,</HI> had the Sirname of <HI>He|ri&s;tal.</HI> Some think that <HI>Pepin,</HI> King <HI>of France,</HI> was born here. 'Tis certain that Prince plea&s;ed him&s;elf &s;o much in this Place, that he cau&s;ed a very magnificent Palace to be built
<PB N="248" REF="141"> here, wherein he made his Abode very often. Many of his Succe&s;&s;ors enjoy'd it a long time after; as appears by Charters and Grants da|ted from this Place. One in particular is mention'd of <HI>Charles the Simple,</HI> which takes notice that this King was in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. But it was afterward de&s;troy'd by the <HI>Normans,</HI> and &s;ince that, the Place is become but a mean Village, and has no Remainders of any for|mer Greatne&s;s. The Church we &s;aw look'd in a good Condition on the out-&s;ide; it is a lo&s;ty and great Building. We pa&s;s'd through the Place without &s;topping, and &s;o could &s;ee nothing but what was in our way.</P>
<P>We went on &s;till, on this &s;ide the River, till we came almo&s;t over-again&s;t the upper end of <HI>Vi&s;et,</HI> or <HI>We&s;et,</HI> where we were to cro&s;s the <HI>Mae&s;e:</HI> We came to a Village where there are &s;everal Stores of Timber, and many Peo|ple employ'd in building Merchant-Ve&s;&s;els for this River. We cro&s;&s;ed the <HI>Mae&s;e</HI> here with our Charrette after a manner that was ab&s;olute|ly new to us. They had a long narrow Boat call'd a <HI>Naken,</HI> the ends of it were ju&s;t alike, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A <HI>Naken.</HI></NOTE> and tapering &s;omewhat, but not to a point; the breadth in the middle part is ju&s;t enough for a good large Hor&s;e to &s;tand acro&s;s it. They took our Hor&s;es out of the Charretre, and thru&s;t it down to the Water; then the Boat was pu&s;h'd with one end a&s;hoar, where it went under the Axletree of the Charrette, which lodg'd upon it: It was then put off, and the other end turn'd a&s;hoar for another Chariot to ride upon it; this done, they turn'd a&s;ide a&s;hoar, and took in our two Hor&s;es, and two more. Thus was this Boat &s;ufficiently

As &s;oon almo&s;t as we were within the Wall, our way was right up the Hill, &s;o we could not &s;ee but one end of it, which look'd well enough. When we were through the other Gate, and gone out again, which was &s;oon done, we &s;till mounted a pretty &s;teep Hill which runs up far above the Town; we walk'd, to ea&s;e our Hor&s;es, above an Engli&s;h Mile a&s;cending. This Pa&s;&s;age from hence to <HI>Aix</HI> is all through a hilly Country; we were almo&s;t continually a&s;cending or de&s;cending &s;ome great Hill; the large&s;t Plains were u&s;ual|ly upon the tops of the Hills. All the&s;e Hills appear'd a very good Mould; that which was plain at the top, we found con&s;tantly till'd for Grains, and &s;aw upon them very good and promi&s;ing Crops of Wheat and Rye; the Bar|ly was but ju&s;t &s;own, and very little of it was come up. The &s;teep &s;ides of the&s;e Hills were either cover'd with Wood, or el&s;e were good green Downs for Sheep.</P>
<P>As we came near to <HI>Aix,</HI> the Hills were cover'd extreamly thick with a white Stone, like a Lime-&s;tone, which lay upon a Mould &s;omewhat darker than Fullers-Earth, but which &s;eem'd &s;uch a &s;ort of Sub&s;tance.

<P>It is agreed to have been a very ancient City, but the Beginnings of it are &s;omewhat <NOTE PLACE="marg">Original,</NOTE> di&s;puted. <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> will have it to be built by <HI>Granus,</HI> a Brother of <HI>Nero</HI> the Roman Empe|ror; but it is not found that <HI>Nero</HI> had ever a Brother of that Name. Some think that <HI>Seren|nius Granus</HI> built it in the time of the Emperor <HI>Adrian.</HI> 'Tis certain that the Romans, while they made War upon the Germans, had fre|quent Settlements and Fortifications in the&s;e Countries, between the <HI>Mae&s;e</HI> and the <HI>Rhine;</HI> and tho&s;e were in many Places, the fir&s;t begin|nings of what grew to be Cities in follow|ing Times. The Romans make mention of the&s;e Baths, and always call'd the Place <HI>Aqui&s;|granum,</HI> or <HI>Aquae Grani.</HI> The Low Dutch call the City <HI>Aken,</HI> the Germans <HI>Aach,</HI> and the French <HI>Aix,</HI> contracted from <HI>Eaux,</HI> which in their Language &s;ignifies Waters.

It was utterly ruin'd by the Goths and Huns, when they broke in upon the Empire, under the Leading of <HI>Attila,</HI> that prodigious Man of Mi&s;chief, &s;ome time after the Year of our
<PB N="252" REF="143"> Lord 400; and after this, the&s;e Baths were neglected and forgotten.

<P>This City is &s;ituate in a Valley, but at one &s;ide of it, &s;o that part of the City runs up a good way on the &s;ide of a neighbouring Hill. From the Wall on that &s;ide, one has a wide and plea&s;ant Pro&s;pect all over the City, and a large neighbouring Valley, to the Hills which bound that and our &s;ight. It looks very plea|&s;antly, by virtue of the Mixture of Trees with the Hou&s;es, and of Orchards and Gardens, e&s;pecially towards the out-&s;ide of the outer|mo&s;t City.

The great Market-Place is very large, bigger than what we had &s;een in &s;ome bigger Cities: Up|on this &s;tands the Town-Hou&s;e, a &s;tately hand&s;ome Building, and which looks great enough to become &s;o Famous a City. 'Tis built of Stone, and is ob&s;ervable at a di&s;tance by two high Towers which &s;tand up at the two ends of the Front. The Citizens built this Hou&s;e at their own Charge, about the Year 1353. In the middle of the Great Mar|ket-place, before it, &s;tands a Noble Fountain, which was erected in the Year 1620. From a height of 14 or 15 feet, or perhaps more, there are 4 good Spouts of Water which con|tinually run into a great bra&s;s Ba&s;on, of 10 feet in Diameter, and about 30 in Circumfe|rence; it is &s;aid to contain in it 12000 Pounds of Bra&s;s.

<P>In this City is one of the chief Manufa|ctures of Needles perhaps in the World, tho' <NOTE PLACE="marg">Needles.</NOTE> the Wyre which they make them of is not made here, but comes from &s;ome other Parts of <HI>Germany.</HI> We went to &s;ee &s;ome of the Work about the making of the&s;e.

<P>In this City, be&s;ides the Chapel of <HI>Charle|maigne,</HI> were Four Pari&s;h Churches, one of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Churches.</NOTE> which, the Church of St. <HI>John,</HI> lies at pre|&s;ent in Ruines. There are a great Number of the Churches of the Religious Orders, as they are call'd. In one of the Parochial Churches, which they call St. <HI>James's,</HI> there was held on this Day, being the 25th. of <HI>May,</HI> New Stile, a <HI>Kermis.</HI> As we went to it we moun|ted <NOTE PLACE="marg">K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">rmis.</NOTE> a long Street, which was all the way be&s;et with great green Boughs, which &s;tood-high, like little Trees, and all the Ground was &s;trow'd
<PB N="258" REF="146"> with Greens, and they were mingled &s;ome|times with &s;uch Flowers as could be gotten. When we came to the Church, we found it but &s;mall, but made very fine on this Occa&s;i|on. We were there at the time of Com|pline; the Church was very full, and we &s;tood in a Crowd, but &s;taid a good while very wil|lingly to hear the Mu&s;ick, which was made by a mixture of Organs and Voices, both very good, and perfectly harmonious and agreeing. We did not &s;ee any Image &s;tanding upon a Carriage in the Church, as is u&s;ual when they are carried in Proce&s;&s;ion, therefore I be|lieve, though there had been a Proce&s;&s;ion about the Pari&s;h, they had carried only the Ho&s;tie. When we went from the Church, our way was down a broad Street, which for a good way was be&s;et, as afore&s;aid, with tall Boughs, that look'd like little Trees, and was &s;trow'd with Greens. Be&s;ides this, they had, to adorn the Street, tied &s;everal Ropes cro&s;s the way, at the &s;econd Stories of the Hou&s;es, and the&s;e were all cover'd, and hid with green Leaves which they had fa&s;ten'd about them. Some|times we &s;hould &s;ee Two of the&s;e Ropes &s;o order'd, that they cro&s;s'd one another in the middle of the Street, and where they cro&s;s'd there hung a Crown, made of &s;ome &s;light matter, but glittering like Gold. Upon Ropes &s;o tied acro&s;s the Streets we &s;aw here, and &s;omewhere el&s;e in our Journey, &s;ome Pack|threads hanging down from them, of about Five or Six Feet long; the&s;e would have &s;ome|thing or other at the ends of them to make a &s;how, and they had fa&s;ten'd to them, I know <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ot how, a great many bits of Window Gla&s;s,
<PB N="259" REF="146"> mixed with green Leaves; the&s;e, as the Wind mov'd them, and the Sun &s;hone upon them, made a very pretty &s;urprizing gli&s;tering. This that I have mentioned is all that belong'd to the <HI>Kermis</HI> here, and no other part of the Ci|ty, be&s;ides this Pari&s;h, was concern'd with it. I remember, at <HI>Louvain</HI> there was a particular <HI>Kermis</HI> held, as I think, by the <HI>Augustine</HI> Monks, which con&s;i&s;ted in nothing more but what has been &s;aid: And, I think, at <HI>Leeuwe</HI> it was a <HI>Kermis</HI>-time with them, when we pa&s;s'd through there, where al&s;o there was nothing to be ob&s;erv'd, but a Concour&s;e of People to an annual particular Devotion. The&s;e things oblige me to take notice of the Original and true Nature of a <HI>Kermis.</HI> This Word is a Contraction of <HI>Kerk-mi&s;&s;e,</HI> which &s;ignifies a Church Ma&s;s, or a Ma&s;s celebrated to com|memorate and give Thanks for the furni&s;hing and Con&s;ecration of a Church. To the&s;e So|lemnities there was wont to be a Concour&s;e of People, to &s;ee perhaps the &s;how of a Proce&s;|&s;ion; and &s;ometimes they might be allur'd by &s;ome Indulgencies to be obtain'd in that Church at &s;uch a time. This Concour&s;e of People upon a religious account, invited others to come with Goods of &s;everal Sorts, to &s;ell them upon the&s;e Occa&s;ions; and thus a <HI>Kerk|mi&s;&s;e</HI> came to be accompany'd with what we call a Fair. And among the Calvini&s;ts of the&s;e Parts, with the Popery of the thing the Re|ligion is bani&s;h'd too, and the <HI>Kerk-mi&s;&s;e</HI> is throughly reform'd, according to their man|ner in &s;everal things, into a meer trading and debauching Fair; e&s;pecially in &s;ome Parts, where Trade is reckon'd a thing of more Im|portance
<PB N="260" REF="147"> than Religion; where they retain &s;till the Name of <HI>Kermis,</HI> but have lo&s;t the true thing, though they ob&s;erve their Fairs too at the &s;ame times.</P>
<P>It was <HI>Trinity Sunday</HI> now with the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and &s;o in the Morning there were Sermons in the Chapels of the religious Or|ders: In going about to &s;ee what was to be &s;een, we fell into &s;ome of the&s;e. We ob&s;erv'd them to be generally very neat, and &s;ome of them fine with the Architecture, and Pain|tings, and Ornaments about the Altars. In the <HI>Augu&s;tines</HI> was a great butcherly Fellow in the Pulpit, putting him&s;elf into a Sweat with talking to the People in High Dutch, which is the vulgar Language here. His Church was a pretty large one indeed, but bigger than his Congregation a great deal. In the Church of the <HI>Minor Brothers</HI> was one of that Order preaching, who look'd more like a Scholar; and his Church, though as big as the former, was hardly big enough for his Congregation.</P>
<P>In the Evening our Cour&s;e brought us to the Church of the <HI>Carmelites,</HI> of that Species of them who are call'd the <HI>Brothers of our Good</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Brothers of our Lady.</NOTE> <HI>Lady;</HI> a People very highly allied, we mu&s;t think, who are &s;o nearly akin to the Queen of Heaven and Earth. This was with them the Eve of a very &s;olemn Time. They pretend the Holy Scapulary (which we have mention'd before) was given by the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> to the ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Simon Stock,</HI> on the 16th. Day of <HI>May,</HI> in the Year 1251. which by the Alte|ration of the Calender is now become the 26th. This I &s;uppo&s;e was the Rea&s;on of their celebrating this Fe&s;tival now; which I thought
<PB N="261" REF="147"> they did from what I read in the Paper, prin|ted in High Dutch, which was po&s;ted up at the Church Door. This is an annual Fe&s;tival with the&s;e good People; on this Day they ce|lebrate the Memory of that great Favour; on this Day People enter them&s;elves into the Fra|ternity of the Scapulary; and great Indulgen|cies are to be obtained on this Day and through the <HI>Octave,</HI> by being pre&s;ent at the Devotions to the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> and this Fa|vourite Saint, in the Chapels of the&s;e Bro|thers, but no where el&s;e.</P>
<P>This Garment of the Holy Scapulary, as it is call'd, and the B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">otherhood belonging to it, are profitable things to this Order; and they are all &s;o con&s;iderable in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> that it is worth while to give an Account of &s;ome of the Particulars which are taught and practis'd in this Order, and the Brotherhood join'd to them, relating to this Garment.</P>
<P>The Scapulary is a Name deriv'd, they &s;ay, from the Latin Word <HI>Scapulare,</HI> which &s;igni|fies a Shoulder-cloathing. It con&s;i&s;ts of Two Pieces of Cloth, &s;own together upon the Shoulders, where it &s;preads enough to cover them, and from thence hangs down before and behind into Slips of Cloth, which are each about a quarter of a Yard broad; and t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">us they &s;ay it re&s;embles a Cro&s;s.

<P>The u&s;e of this thing, they &s;ay, is very old in the Order of <HI>our Good Lady of Mount Carmel,</HI> (as they call them&s;elves:) Even from the time of <HI>Elias</HI> it has been u&s;ed, who fir&s;t wore it him&s;elf, and after his Example his Di&s;ciples and Followers have done the &s;ame. The De|vil has always greatly fear'd this Garment; but the Power of it has been very much encreas'd &s;ince it has been con&s;ecrated by our Good La|dy, and made a Token of a Covenant between her, and tho&s;e who &s;hall devoutly wear it. How the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> came to Honour it thus, they give this Account.</P>
<P>When this Good Order were driven out of <HI>Pale&s;tine</HI> by the Turks, and forced to fly into &s;everal Parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> and were there in great Di&s;tre&s;s, not being very well entertain'd where they came, they betook them&s;elves for Refuge to God, and the Holy Maid <HI>Mary,</HI> their particular Patrone&s;s. And the Holy <HI>Simon Stock</HI> being then Prior-General of the Order, he took the matter to Heart more than any Body be&s;ides, praying this Gracious Mo|ther with great Humility and Zeal to come to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance; and that through her Me|rits &s;ome Privilege and Advantage to their Order might be obtain'd, the which was now &s;o low and oppre&s;s'd. And very often to plea&s;e her he read the Hymn <HI>Flos Carmeli, &amp;c.</HI> to her Honour. The Holy Maid, and Mother of Mercy, li&s;tening to the Prayers of her Chil|dren,
<PB N="263" REF="148"> appear'd to this Saint, attended with a multitude of Angels, in a mighty Glory; and gave him the Scapulary as a Token of her par|ticular Friend&s;hip, and her Protection and De|fence of his Order, and of all tho&s;e who &s;hall devoutly wear the &s;ame, &s;aying to him (the&s;e remarkable Words.)

<P>To advance this Habit, they extravagantly advance the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, and tell us that &s;he is exalted in Merit and Glory, and Excel|lency, above all Mankind, and above all the Quires of Angels: (I know not whence they learn this) So that &s;he is to be &s;erv'd with an Honour and Veneration beyond all Crea|tures, nam'd <HI>Hyperdulia:</HI> And &s;he is honour'd by the Holy Church, (they mean the Church of <HI>Rom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">)</HI> with the&s;e Titles; Door of Heaven; Cau&s;e of our Joy; Refuge of Sinners; Mother of Mercy; Our Life, and Our Hope.

In&s;omuch, that among the apparent Tokens that a Man is cho&s;en to Everla&s;ting Sal|vation, this is to be reckon'd a con&s;iderable one; namely a &s;incere Honour, active Devo|tion, and Love to <HI>Mary;</HI> and &s;o the matter is well mended.</P>
<P>There are many mighty Privileges attend the devout wearing of this Scapulary, if we may believe the&s;e People. As fir&s;t, a parti|cular A&s;&s;i&s;tance they &s;hall have from it towards a happy Death: An A&s;&s;i&s;tance towards Deli|verance out of Purgatory; e&s;pecially on eve|ry <HI>Saturday</HI> after their Death, the which Day they &s;ay is particularly devoted to her. This &s;he her &s;elf made known to Pope <HI>John</HI> II. who &s;ays &s;he appear'd to him dre&s;s'd like one of this Order, and among other things (as wi&s;e) &s;he &s;aid, that &s;he would &s;tand by every Per&s;on who &s;hould devoutly wear this Holy Garment, and enter them&s;elves in this Bro|therhood; that they &s;hould be ab&s;olv'd from the third Part of their Sins upon the Day of their Entrance; and that on every <HI>Saturday</HI> &s;he would de&s;cend into Purgatory, and &s;o ma|ny of this Brotherhood as &s;he &s;hould find there, &s;he would deliver, and bring them to the Mount of Everla&s;ting Life. But they mu&s;t, to merit this, read at appointed times &s;uch and &s;uch Prayers to the Virgin; and tho&s;e who cannot read, mu&s;t, in&s;tead of it,

Another Privilege is Protection in Danger, and particu|lar Help again&s;t the Devil and Witchcraft; And on this Occa&s;ion a multitude of &s;winging Stories of Miraculous Deliverances are told.</P>
<P>Among the Privileges attending the Sca|pulary, mu&s;t be reckon'd the Indulgences gran|ted to this Brotherhood, and al&s;o to all Be|lievers, who &s;hall upon &s;uch and &s;uch days Vi&s;it the Chapels of this Order, and the&s;e are many.

It is likewi&s;e to be reckon'd a mighty Privilege of this Brotherhood, that every Brother and Si|&s;ter &s;hall partake in all the Merits of this Ble&s;&s;ed Order. This is the common Wheedle to draw Men into the&s;e Brotherhoods.</P>
<P>In order to their obtaining the&s;e Privileges, the&s;e three things are requir'd: (1.)

This is the outward and bodily wear|ing of this Garment; but be&s;ides this, there is a &s;piritual wearing of it al&s;o requir'd: For as the Body has Life through the Soul, &s;o like|wi&s;e the outward wearing of the Scapulary mu&s;t become vital and profitable to the Soul, through the pious and devout wearing of the &s;ame; namely, with the &s;ame Regard and Ap|plication of Mind to this (or greater) with that which Men or Maid-Servants bear to the Livery of their Ma&s;ter or Lady. To which end, the Brothers and Si&s;ters &s;hall very profi|tably ob&s;erve the&s;e Five Exerci&s;es following: (1.) When they ri&s;e in the Morning, as al&s;o when at Night they go to &s;leep, they &s;hall ki&s;s the Scapulary, and making a Cro&s;s with it, &s;hall ble&s;s them&s;elves, &s;aying, <HI>May the Holy Maid</HI> Mary, <HI>and her &s;weet little Child,</HI> (&s;o they repre&s;ent our Saviour, for the mo&s;t part, &s;till) <HI>ble&s;s us.</HI> Or at lea&s;t they &s;hould, looking up|on the Scapulary, offer up to God the Works of the Day under the Guidance and Govern|ment of this Holy Patrone&s;s. (2.) In all Occa&s;ions of Danger, both of Soul and Body; and in all Temptations, they mu&s;t in Heart turn them&s;elves to the mo&s;t H. Mother of God, imploring her A&s;&s;i&s;tance. (3.) They mu&s;t endeavour to avoid all that is contrary to Mode&s;ty, as very di&s;plea&s;ing to the Queen of Virgins, and Mother of the King of Vir|gins. (4.) Often in the Day, as they begin any Work, they &s;hould Offer it up to God, and recommend it to the mo&s;t Holy Maid, as a good Governe&s;s; and mu&s;t perform, and bring it to Perfection to her Honour. (5.) They mu&s;t be careful to merit and obtain the Indul|gences
<PB N="267" REF="150"> granted to the Brotherhood of this Holy Garment, (that e&s;pecially was not to be omitted, becau&s;e for the&s;e they mu&s;t go to the Churches of the&s;e good Fathers, and there drop their Offerings.)</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude the Account of this matter with certain Elogiums of the Scapulary, de|liver'd by a Zealous <HI>Carm,</HI> in a Sermon preach'd within the Dioce&s;s of <HI>Arras,</HI> on the <HI>21st.</HI> of <HI>July,</HI> 1697. The 20th. day of this Month is with them the Fea&s;t-day of their Holy Father, as they call him, the Prophet <HI>Elias,</HI> who fir&s;t wore this Garment, and in&s;tituted this Order; and &s;o this was within the <HI>Octave</HI> of that Fe&s;tival. The Propo&s;itions are the&s;e following.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Simon Stock</HI> has receiv'd the Scapulary, as a certain mark of his Prede&s;ti|nation, and of that of the Religious of his Order, and of tho&s;e others too, who in pro|ce&s;s of time &s;hall receive and wear it.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Hi&s;tory of the Ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Simon Stock</HI> is in a degree of certainty which approaches that of the Faith; and it cannot be doubted of without being guilty of a &s;ort of Infidelity, into which all wi&s;e and pious People ought to be afraid of falling.</P>
<P N="3">3. Among all the Practices of Devotion found out to Honour the Holy Virgin, that of the Scapulary is the mo&s;t certain mark of Pre|de&s;tination, and the mo&s;t a&s;&s;ured &s;ign of Sal|vation.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Children and Brothers of the Sca|pulary ought to &s;ay to the Holy Virgin, <HI>Be it unto me according to thy Word,</HI> with the &s;ame Submi&s;&s;ion to her, which &s;he her &s;elf paid to to the Promi&s;es of God, which were made to her by the Angel.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="268" REF="151">5. If the Holy Virgin &s;hould permit that the Children and Brothers of the Scapulary &s;hould be Eternally Mi&s;erable, their Lo&s;s would afford Triumphs to the Enemies of the Ho|nour of her Name, and would furni&s;h Pre|tences for their Bla&s;phemies.</P>
<P N="6">6. The Church has been willing that the Believers &s;hould under&s;tand that they are to expect no le&s;s Favours from the Ble&s;&s;ed Vir|gin, than from the Merits of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="7">7. A Brother of the Scapulary, who &s;hall ob&s;tinately &s;et him&s;elf to go on in Wickedne&s;s to his Death, may die in Impenitence, but he cannot die in the Scapulary: And if the Holy Virgin cannot withdraw him from his Di&s;|orders and Sins, &s;he will find means to deprive him of his Scapulary, and will rather take it from him her &s;elf, than &s;uffer that he &s;hould die a Reprobate in it.</P>
<P>The&s;e are very pretty things! and but what is commonly &s;aid in Commendation of the Scapulary by the&s;e Fathers, who&s;e Intere&s;t it is to recommend it. But the&s;e things how|ever &s;eem'd at lea&s;t to di&s;plea&s;e the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Arras,</HI> and he has taken upon him the Bold|ne&s;s to Cen&s;ure and Condemn them: But his Condemnation looks a little forc'd, and hardly in earne&s;t, while he &s;peaks of the &s;ame Matters very near with the &s;ame Extrava|gance.</P>
<P>He &s;ays, We cannot too much exhort the People to Devotion to the Holy Virgin: That this is a great Source of Ble&s;&s;ings and Graces for tho&s;e who have a true and &s;incere one: He &s;ays too, that the Brotherhood of the Sca|pulary ought to be regarded as a Chri&s;tian
<PB N="269" REF="151"> Bond, and a Holy A&s;&s;ociation of &s;everal Per|&s;ons to Honour the Holy Virgin, by wearing a certain Habit, by which they te&s;tifie their willingne&s;s to Dedicate and Con&s;ecrate them|&s;elves to her Service. And if this be done in Truth and Fidelity, one may expect by the Succour and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Mother of Mercy, not only particular Favours during this Life, and at Death; but al&s;o that the Pains which our Sins have de&s;erv'd, &s;hall be dimini&s;h'd, and our Eternal Happine&s;s be advanced by the Merit of the Indulgences which the Church has granted to this Brotherhood, for all tho&s;e to partake of them who &s;hall be found in the Condition which &s;he requires for the gaining them.</P>
<P>It behov'd the Bi&s;hop to &s;peak thus tender|ly<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> for this Folly and Super&s;tition has been own'd and authoriz'd, and is encourag'd by the See of <HI>Rome.</HI> But all this, now, is admi|rable Divinity, and they mu&s;t needs de&s;erve to be call'd Hereticks, who do not believe and teach &s;uch Stuff as this; yea, and as Hereticks they ought to be per&s;ecuted to the Death, again&s;t all the Obligation of Oaths, Promi&s;es, Covenants, and even Humanity it &s;elf. But, Lord, how long!</P>
<P>This time, when we were at the Chapel of the&s;e <HI>Carms</HI> at <HI>Aix,</HI> being the Eve of that great Day wherein they pretend the Scapulary was given to <HI>Simon Stock,</HI> the Devotions upon the Occa&s;ion were according to Cu&s;tome then be|gun. A great Concour&s;e of People throng'd the little Church. We came there ju&s;t at the beginning of a Proce&s;&s;ion. It march'd down <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">he South I&s;le of the Church; and, cro&s;&s;ing
<PB N="270" REF="152"> the We&s;t end, went out at the bottom, at a North Door, and then turn'd round in a Pa&s;|&s;age that went round the Church, and came into the great Street at the We&s;t end again; fetch'd a little compa&s;s in that, and went to the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of it, and from thence cro&s;s'd again, and came in at the great We&s;tern Door. A Company of Quea&s;ils led the Van of this Proce&s;&s;ion, all of them with their Veils over their Heads, tho' the Weather was good, and it was not for fear of Rain, but out of Reve|rence to the Virgin. In the head of them, Four of their Company carry'd upon their Shoulders a little Image of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> very richly cloath'd with a Robe of Cloth of Silver, and a Crown on her Head. The Crown was Silver, and her Robe flouri&s;h'd over with an Embroidery of Gold. The Quea&s;ils &s;ung as they went along; they were follow'd by a great Company of other Wo|men, who went Two and Two in great Or|der. After the&s;e march'd about Forty of the <HI>Carmes</HI> in their Habits, and they were all &s;ing|ing too. Then about a Dozen of them fol|low'd, with Surplices and Copes upon them; the&s;e were immediately follow'd by the Ho&s;t, which was carried in a gilt Remon&s;tranter, un|der a Canopy of Silk, by a <HI>Carme,</HI> in a very rich Cope of Cloth of Silver, with Embroi|dery about it. After him came a great Com|pany of Men in Di&s;order. There were no Flambeaux's this time, nor any Men, but the Monks that march'd before the Ho&s;t. We had not &s;o much Devotion to the Scapulary, as to Honour it in following the Proce&s;&s;ion; and therefore, while they were going their Pro|ce&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="271" REF="152"> we viewed the Church, which was well dre&s;s'd, &s;melt very &s;trong of Incen&s;e, and had a great many Wax-Tapors lighted, and &s;et in Siver Candle&s;ticks, about the High Al|tar; the piece of Painting over that, was the Repre&s;entation of the feign'd A&s;&s;umption of the Virgin <HI>Mary.</HI> There was nothing particu|lar to be ob&s;erv'd here. We came to the <HI>Do|minicans</HI> Church after this, which is hand&s;ome and large; there were very few People at this Church now. The Monks were &s;igning their Devotions in a Place behind the High Altar, where they were not to be &s;een. A Rail at the Ea&s;t end of the North I&s;le, enclos'd a Cha|pel, which I &s;uppo&s;e is dedicated to St. <HI>Willi|broerd;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>St.</HI> Willi|broerd.</NOTE> becau&s;e on the Wall, at the &s;ide of the Chapel, was a Picture of a Bi&s;hop at full length, and under it this In&s;cription in Latin; <HI>Caput &s;ancti Willibrordi miraculis &amp; hominum vi|&s;itatione Celebre.</HI> It &s;eems, they pretend to have the Head of St. <HI>Willibroerd.</HI> It did not appear, and therefore is &s;hown but at certain times, perhaps only on a particular Holy-day, and with a &s;olemn Ma&s;s, and &s;o it makes a gaudy Day to the Monks of this Convent. He was, 'tis &s;aid, the fir&s;t Bi&s;hop of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> and the great In&s;trument of converting the Heathen Franks there, who po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the Country at that time, having driven out the Romans. Our Hi&s;torian, <HI>Bede,</HI> &s;ays of him, he was an <HI>Anglo-Saxon,</HI> and died in the Year of our Lord 636. He is a Saint of great Repute in all the&s;e Countries; and one &s;hall frequently meet with at lea&s;t an Altar and Chapel dedicated to him. At a Village near <HI>Antwerp,</HI> there is a Church which goes by his Name, as dedicated to him, which is there the Pari&s;h Church.</P>
<PB N="272" REF="153">
<P>The Je&s;uites have at <HI>Aix</HI> a very large and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Je&s;uites.</NOTE> commodious Hou&s;e, and they are making it larger. We went fir&s;t into their Chapel. Over the Door of this, on the out-&s;ide, in Letters of Gold, is written <HI>Sancte Michael, Sancte Jo&s;eph, Orate pro nobis.</HI> By an In&s;cription on the in&s;ide, over the Portal of another Door, is &s;ignified, that this Chapel was con&s;ecrated in the Year of our Lord, 1628. by <HI>Petrus Aloy&s;ius Caraffa Epi&s;copus Inicaren&s;is,</HI> under the Name of <HI>Saint Michael, and all Angels.</HI> The Form of this Chapel, the &s;ame with that of all the Je|&s;uites Chapels that I have &s;een, is Oblong, with Galleries over the two &s;ide I&s;les, which run the whole length of the I&s;les, and are &s;up|ported by the Pillars which &s;tand up on each &s;ide the middle I&s;le, to the top of the Church, and &s;upport the Roof of it. This Fa&s;hion is very convenient, and looks very magnificent and hand&s;ome. The Organ and Mu&s;ick have a Gallery which goes acro&s;s the We&s;t end of the Chapel. The Ea&s;t end, wherein the High Altar &s;tands, is a large Semi-circle, the Dia|meter the whole breadth of the middle I&s;le, and without a Rail, or any Partition before it. The Wall round this, at the bottom of the great Windows, is curiou&s;ly carv'd for about the depth of Six Feet, in the Repre&s;entation of Vines and Flowers. The matter is Stone, I cannot tell whether Marble or not, for it was all richly gilded with Gold. The Altar Piece repre&s;ents the laying our Saviour, as dead, in|to his Sepulchre, the Figures, and the Faces concern'd, are extreamly well drawn. This Piece is &s;urrounded by a very beautiful Ar|chitecture of Marble, a great deal of which,
<PB N="273" REF="153"> in convenient Places, is gilded. There are Two Chapels at the Two Sides of this Semi|circle, to which one enters by little Doors, and they are perfectly enclos'd. They are extreamly neat and fine, both of them; that on the North &s;ide is dedicated to &s;ome one of the pretended Saints of their Order, I think it to be <HI>Ignatius Loyola</HI> their Founder. In the other is an Altar-piece, which I think wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">th taking particular notice of. There is painted an old Man with a Triple Crown on his Head, in the Clouds, but as come down to the mid|dle, almo&s;t, of the Piece, and with Angels about him. He with his Arms &s;pread, addre&s;|&s;es him&s;elf to a Woman, in a manner of Court|&s;hip, who is &s;itting a little below with a Child in her Lap. Another Man &s;its at her Right Hand; they both look very plea&s;antly on the old Man; neither of them are in a Po&s;ture of Adoration. Over the Head of the Woman, and pretty near her, is a Pigeon, in the Po|&s;ture of flying towards her, with a green Garland in its Bill, which he directs, as de&s;ign|ing to drop it upon her Head. Now, with|out a very di&s;tinct, and impious Interpreta|tion too, one would think this Bu&s;ine&s;s de&s;ign'd to repre&s;ent an old Man, &s;ome Pope or other, de&s;igning to borrow of another Man, with his con&s;ent, the u&s;e of his Wife; and in his Pre|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ence, and with his Con&s;ent, courting her to his Will. I doubt not but this is the mo&s;t in|nocent and &s;afe Interpretation of this Picture; I mu&s;t confe&s;s, the &s;ight of it would make a Man fall to his Prayers; but my Prayer upon this Occa&s;ion would be this, <HI>Good Lord, bring into the Way of Truth all &s;uch as have erred and</HI>
<PB N="274" REF="154"> <HI>are deceived; and to that end be plea&s;ed to deliver, in thy due Time, all that bear the Name of Chri|&s;tians, from the Vile In&s;tructions of &s;uch impious, bla&s;phemous, and idolatrous Books.</HI></P>
<P>After this we went to &s;ee the Hou&s;e, which was &s;hown us very particularly, we having with us a Friend of theirs. We went up Two Stories, in each of which is a long Gallery, with lodging Rooms all on one &s;ide of it. At one end of the fir&s;t Gallery &s;tood a Concave Steel, poli&s;h'd, and of about Twelve or Four|teen Inches Diameter; before this a Lamp is &s;et, which when 'tis lighted, this Concave Steel, by Reflection, &s;o encrea&s;es the Light, that it reaches, to good purpo&s;e, to the fur|ther end of the Gallery, though it be a very long one. In this lower Gallery, between the Doors of the Chambers, are hung up &s;ome &s;orry little Pictures, in Frames, the mo&s;t of them repre&s;enting the pretended Saints and Martyrs of their Order. Among others, there is the Picture of a Man, to the Wa&s;te, with a remarkably broad Butcher's Knife drawn, as &s;tuck into the middle of his Brea&s;t; this made us take notice of, and read the In&s;cription at the bottom of the Picture. The In&s;cription &s;ignifies, that this is <HI>Thomas Harcourt,</HI> who was put to Death at <HI>Tyburn,</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> for the true Faith. Thus they make a Martyr of a Man, who was executed after a fair and legal Tryal, and Conviction of High-Trea&s;on a|gain&s;t his Sovereign. In the Gallery above this, in the &s;econd Story, there were In&s;crip|tions over &s;everal Doors, which fignified them Chambers de&s;ign'd for Strangers; that is, for the Reception of tho&s;e of their Order who
<PB N="275" REF="154"> come to the Baths here. Over other Doors there were the&s;e In&s;criptions, <HI>Magi&s;ter Logi|ces, Magister Syntaxeos, Magi&s;ter Mediae Gram|matices, Magi&s;ter Infimae Grammatices.</HI> For they have belonging to this Hou&s;e a great Build|ing, wherein are &s;everal Schools for Grammar and Philo&s;ophy, in which they teach, they &s;ay, I think, about Eight hundred Scholars of all &s;orts together. We went into one of the Chambers for Strangers, and found there a lit|tle Bed, a Table, a Chair, and a Candle&s;tick: I took notice that this an&s;wer'd the Furniture of the Prophet's Chamber, mention'd in Scrip|ture; and the Je&s;uite pointed to &s;omewhat more here, which I did not before &s;ee, that was a &s;looping Shelf, with a Breviary upon it, and below a little Plank to kneel upon; here the Je&s;uite was to pay his Devotions to the Virgin <HI>Mary.</HI> At the end of this Gallery is their Library, which is no great Room, and yet not near fill'd with Books; and they are al&s;o old, and in a bad Condition, &s;o that this is al|together neglected. They have built a large Addition to their College, which has Two Stories in it, with Two long Galleries, and Chambers in them like the other, but this was not quite fini&s;h'd. In the fir&s;t Story of this he &s;how'd us a good capacious Room, which they de&s;ign for a Library, &s;o that they will now apply them&s;elves to the Improvement of that. In one long Room of the Hou&s;e were a great many little Appartiments, like the common Boxes in the <HI>London</HI> Ale-Hou&s;es; and at the end of the Room is a great Stove. This Contri|vance is to keep them warm at their Studies in Winter, for all things are commonly order'd
<PB N="276" REF="155"> with great Conveniency for tho&s;e good Men, who renounce the World, and pretend to great Mortifications.</P>
<P>Let us now go to the great Church, built by <HI>Charlemaigne.</HI> He erected this at his own <NOTE PLACE="marg">Charle|maigne's <HI>Chapel.</HI></NOTE> Charge, and brought hither Pope <HI>Leo</HI> III. and Three hundred &s;ixty three Bi&s;hops to the Con|&s;ecration of it, in the Year 804. It was de|dicated to our Saviour, and the Ble&s;&s;ed Vir|gin; but our Saviour's Intere&s;t in that, as well as in the Wor&s;hip there perform'd, is well nigh ju&s;tled out, and the Name it is call'd by now, is <HI>De Urouwen Kerk,</HI> that is as much as <HI>Notredame,</HI> or <HI>Our Ladies Church.</HI> The Em|peror &s;ettl'd here, when he fir&s;t built it, a Mo|na&s;tery of <HI>Benedictines,</HI> who were to live in common, under the Direction of an Abbot: But the&s;e at length transform'd them&s;elves into Canons Seculars, and divided the Revenue among them, appropriating to each Man his Share, and in this State they are at pre&s;ent. That which was properly <HI>Charlemaigne</HI>'s Cha|pel, is a round Building, and very dark. As &s;oon as one is enter'd, a Man finds him&s;elf un|der a broad dark I&s;le, if I may &s;o call it, which goes round the Church; the arched Roof of this, is &s;upported by very va&s;t Stone Pillars. Over this I&s;le there is a Gallery, which goes round the Church al&s;o; I &s;aw no way open that led to it, and therefore we did not go up. This is &s;urrounded on the out&s;ide with Marble Pillars, which &s;upport the Roof of that, and the arched top of the Church which ri&s;es in the Form of a <HI>Cupolo.</HI> There is a Painting on the Arch of the <HI>Cupolo,</HI> which has been fine, but has now not only lo&s;t its
<PB N="277" REF="155"> Beauty, but is &s;o decay'd, one cannot well tell what to make of it. Time and hard U|&s;age have defaced the Beauty of this Church extreamly, and depriv'd it of Finery and Riches, which it was formerly po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of. On the Ea&s;t &s;ide of the ancient, and fir&s;t Cha|pel, is now a magnificent and large Quire, al|mo&s;t as big as the other; this is very light, with great Windows, made after the later Fa|&s;hion. This was built at the Charge of the City, long after the other, about the Year 1353. 'Tis &s;aid to be Fifty Feet in length within, and of a proportionable breadth. In the middle of this &s;tands a large Tomb of black poli&s;h'd Marble, very plain, in which lies bury'd the Emperour <HI>Otho</HI> III. The Em|perour <HI>Charlemaigne,</HI> as he died in this City, &s;o he was bury'd in the Chapel which he built here. His Monument at fir&s;t was no way fine, and had no other In&s;cription on it but this, which was &s;et on by his own Order,

<P><HI>Corpus, hoc conditum e&s;t Sepulchro.</HI></P></Q></P>
<P>There was nothing of this &s;hown us, and therefore I &s;uppo&s;e it does not remain. 'Tis &s;aid the Emperour <HI>Frederick</HI> I. took his Body out of his Tomb, and put part of it in a Silver Che&s;t, over the Altar of the Quire, and a part of it on the right &s;ide of the Church, again&s;t the Wall of the old Building, where he built a curious Monument of Marble about it. This does not appear; and the Silver Che&s;t is gone too, I doubt not, for they told us nothing of
<PB N="278" REF="156"> it, and the Havocks which have been made here by barbarous Nations, would leave no &s;uch things.</P>
<P>The chief Altar of this Church, is dedica|ted to the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> and &s;tands on the Ea&s;t &s;ide the Church, between that and the Quire. It was now dre&s;s'd up, I believe, in its be&s;t manner, this being a Fe&s;tival-time, but was not very fine. There &s;tood an Image of the Virgin over it, about as big as a Child of Two Years old, with a rich Robe of Cloth of Sil|ver upon her, and a Crown and Scepter, which al&s;o &s;eem'd to be Silver. The Entran|ces into the Quire are on each &s;ide of this Al|tar. I ob&s;erv'd over this Altar, but within the Quire, there &s;tood a large Iron Che&s;t, up|on Iron Pillars, which was as high as the Gal|lery almo&s;t. It has a top like the Roof of a Hou&s;e; Three great Iron Chains were laid over it, which were fa&s;ten'd at the bottom, on one &s;ide with Staples, at the other &s;ide with Three great Padlocks. When the Service was done, I asked one of the Chanoines what was contain'd therein: He &s;aid, the&s;e following Relicks; We have here the Shift which the Vir|gin <NOTE PLACE="marg">Relicks.</NOTE> <HI>Mary</HI> wore when &s;he was delivered of our Saviour, and it has upon it, &s;ays he, &s;ome Drops of her Milk, which were &s;hed in the &s;uckling of him; there are al&s;o &s;ome of the Swadling Cloaths in which our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour was fir&s;t wrapp'd; al&s;o the Cloth which was ticd about his naked Body when he was cruci|fied; and a Cloth which was about <HI>John the Baptist</HI> when he was beheaded, on which are &s;een &s;ome Spots of his Blood.

And they are &s;o impregnated with Salts, that they will yield for every Tun of Water a Pound of Salt. They come with &s;uch a heat out of the Spring, that they are forced to let them &s;tand in Bathing-places a cooling Fifteen or Eighteen hours, before they are tolerable, or fit to Bath in. Over the Places where the Springs ri&s;e they have built Hou&s;es, which are divided into &s;everal little Rooms, in one Room
<PB N="280" REF="157"> is the Pit or Cavity to Bath in, and in a little Room by it is a Bed to Sweat in, when they go out of the Bath. One Hou&s;e will have three, four, or five of the&s;e Baths in it; they are laid with flat Stones, &s;uch as are on Floors, at the &s;ides and bottom, are commonly about twelve or fifteen Feet long, and eight or ten Feet in breadth, and four or five Feet in depth, at the deepe&s;t. The&s;e Hou&s;es have al&s;o each of them a Room, where they that need it, &s;it to have the Water pump'd upon them.</P>
<P>The Drinking of the&s;e Hot Waters at <HI>Aix</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Drinking.</NOTE> is within a few Years become a great and common Practice. They drink only of the Water in the outer City. A Pump is &s;et for this purpo&s;e upon one of the Streams of that Spring which &s;upplies the <HI>Cornelian Baths,</HI> which from the Chymical Experiments made with it, the Phy&s;icians call, A Sulphureo-fal&s;o-Nitrous Water. The Pump &s;tands in the Street, but is lock'd up &s;o as that none can draw of it when the time of Drinking is over. It has by it two Piazza's, and an open Court for the Drinkers to walk in: From it there are three Spouts on three &s;ides of a Square, which one Man, who &s;tands at the other, ea&s;ily keeps running for the greate&s;t number of Drinkers. The Water comes from the Pump as warm as Milk from the Cow, and fit to drink. It &s;eems to have no ill Ta&s;te or Smell. I think our <HI>Chalybeate</HI> or Purging Waters in <HI>England</HI> ta&s;te wor&s;e. They drink of this Water, ri&s;ing gra|dually, to about an Hundred Ounces at the mo&s;t, which may be computed at about four Quarts in a Morning. It has in &s;everal Bodies &s;everal ways of Operation: With &s;ome it pa&s;&s;es
<PB N="281" REF="157"> chiefly by Sweat, with &s;ome by Urine, and with &s;ome by Stool, and they are directed to follow the Inclination of Nature in the thing. But if they &s;weat with it, they mu&s;t go to Bed, and cover them&s;elves warm, and put on dry and clean Cloaths when they ri&s;e. The Wa|ters u&s;ually pa&s;s away, in tho&s;e whom they agree with, in the &s;pace of three or four hours, and then they are fit for Dinner. They order the Drinking and Bathing of &s;everal People very differently, according to the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of &s;everal Di&s;tempers, and as is found mo&s;t agreeable to the Con&s;titutions. But that which &s;eem'd the mo&s;t general and fre|quent Method, was, to drink in the Morning betimes, and to Bath in the Afternoon about four or five hours after Dinner.</P>
<P>We were told, that the hotte&s;t of the&s;e Springs are at <HI>Porcet,</HI> we went therefore to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Porcet</NOTE> &s;ee them. We took the lower way in going thither, and had a very Plea&s;ant Walk through &s;ome Meadows for a while. We came to a good Stream which we &s;aw had upon it an under-&s;hot Mill, which it could very well drive. When we were above this Mill, we found our &s;elves upon a Foot Cau&s;way, which had on each &s;ide of it a brisk Stream of Water. We were told, and putting our Hands into both, found, that the one of the&s;e was warm, and the other cold; they both come down from the Hills about <HI>Porcet,</HI> and ri&s;e not far from one another. The&s;e two Rivulets, which hitherto run di&s;tinct, had upon each of them a Mill, which they drove, by falling upon the Wheels, which we call an over-&s;hot Mill. Ju&s;t above that Mill which the warm Water
<PB N="282" REF="158"> drove, there is a large Mill-Pond, &s;upported with a Dyke on one &s;ide, becau&s;e of the fall of the &s;ide of the Hill, and on the other &s;ide defended by a Dyke from the Brook of fre&s;h and cold Water, which runs clo&s;e by it. This Pond breeds excellent Carps, and in great plenty. They are not thought to eat &s;o well, taken immediately from hence and dre&s;s'd, as from other Waters, though they will grow very large and fat here. Therefore they u&s;ually take them from hence young, and put them to feed and grow in other Ponds. The Miller makes of the &s;elling the&s;e young Carps from hence, for that purpo&s;e, above an Hundred Rix Dollars <HI>per Annum.</HI> We ob&s;erv'd, that a &s;mall Spout of Water from the cold Brook was continually running into this Pond to give it a da&s;h of fre&s;h Water; yet for all this, we could feel a manife&s;t Warmth in the Water of the Pond, and that although we were &s;omewhat the warmer for our walking. When we came to <HI>Porcet,</HI> we found the hot Springs ri&s;e in a narrow Valley, between Two &s;teep Hills. There are, we were told, above Thirty di|&s;tinct Springs of hot Water here, many of which run wa&s;te, and we &s;aw a Stream of &s;moaking Water tumbling down by us in the Valley, with &s;ome Noi&s;e, which &s;moak'd as much as boiling Water thrown down. There are Fifteen bathing Hou&s;es built here, and they have among them, Thirty Baths. We were guided to Two Pits of hot Water, which are open to the Air, which are reckon'd to have in them the hotte&s;t Springs of any in this Place. The Pits were about Four or Five Yards over, with Brick Walls round the &s;ides
<PB N="283" REF="158"> of them, which went to the bottom of the Pits, and &s;tood above Ground almo&s;t Brea&s;t high; the Water in them &s;eem'd to be about Five or Six Feet in depth. It &s;eem'd to have &s;ome|whatof a pale bluei&s;h Colour, but was &s;o clear, that we could &s;ee the bottoms of the Pits very ea&s;ily. And from thence we &s;aw innumerable little Bubbles continually ri&s;e up; &s;uch as one &s;hall &s;ee in Water over the Fire, when it be|comes ready to boil, e&s;pecially if it be put in any thing that is bright and &s;hining; and the Surface of the Water ri&s;es in the&s;e Pits, ju&s;t as Water does when 'tis ready to boil over the Fire. I doubt not to &s;ay, that the Water here is actually boiling hot. There was at each of the&s;e Pits a Place where we could put a Finger to the Water, but could no more endure a Hand or Finger in it, than in Water that boils over the Fire. The&s;e Waters are certainly as hot as Water can be. They will boil Eggs in a little time; and the People take them up from the&s;e Springs, and u&s;e them, as Nature has fit|ted them, upon Occa&s;ion, to &s;cald the Hair off from a Swine, or Feathers from a Fowl.</P>
<P>All the Waters, both here, at <HI>Porcet,</HI> and in the City, have this Property, that in the Throughs and Pa&s;&s;ages of Stone or Wood, through which they run, they leave in a little Time, a great Quantity of heavy &s;andy Stone. The People are forced to how this very often out of tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages, otherwi&s;e they would be quite &s;topp'd up. The Porcetan Waters are reckon'd to have the mo&s;t of this Quality, and to have it from hence, that they carry along with them &s;omewhat more of that fine Sand, which is the matter of this Stone, though, as I
<PB N="284" REF="159"> &s;aid, the&s;e Waters are &s;o clear and clean, that no &s;uch thing can be di&s;cern'd in them. 'Tis judg'd, that this Stone comes from the mixture of the&s;e little Grains of Sand together with the Particles of Salts that are in the&s;e Waters, and which are coagulated by the cold Air. This Stone gathers no where, but where the cold Air, together with the Coldne&s;s of the Stone or wooden Troughs which the Water runs through, do chill it. And they &s;ay, the lea&s;t calcining, and almo&s;t the laying them by a hot Fire, reduces this Stone to a meer loo&s;e Sand again pre&s;ently; the Saline Particles be|ing taken out by the Fire.</P>
<P>The&s;e Baths at <HI>Porcet</HI> are chiefly frequented for Plea&s;ure, by People that are well, who may tumble in them as long as they plea&s;e, without any harm. The Circum&s;tances would not per|mit us to try this Plea&s;ure. We were here led into a Hou&s;e, to &s;ee what they call <HI>een Druogh Bade,</HI> that is, a dry Bath. We went into a lit|tle clo&s;e Room, which was laid over a hot Spring. All the Furniture in it was a wooden Chair, and a Tin Pipe of about Three or Four Inches in Diameter. It con&s;i&s;ted of &s;everal Joints, to be taken off, or put on, as it was re|quir'd to be, &s;horter or longer. That which was to be always uppermo&s;t of the&s;e, was crook'd to a right Angle. In the middle of the Floor of this Chamber was a round Hole, fit for the Pipe to &s;et in, this was &s;topp'd with a leaden Plugg. We felt the Chamber very hot at our fir&s;t Entrance, but when the Plugg was taken out, and the Steam a&s;cended, it quickly grew &s;o hot, that we could not endure it. We put our Hands to the Hole whence it came up,
<PB N="285" REF="159"> but could not endure to hold them there, the Steam came up &s;o very hot. This Steam is by that Pipe, and the crooked end of it directed to any particular Part of the Body that is di&s;af|fected, that the force of the Heat may fall chief|ly upon that Part. Next this Chamber was another little one, with a Bed in it, which they go into from hence to lie warm, and Sweat &s;ome time. There are &s;everal of this &s;ort of Steam-Baths here, and in <HI>Aix.</HI></P>

<P>BEing &s;traitned in time, we were forced hence before we could be aweary of &s;o plea&s;ant, and diverting a Place. On the 27th. of <HI>May</HI> we took a Charrette, which we had hi|red to our &s;elves, to carry us from hence to <HI>Colen,</HI> we had therefore in our Charrette but one Hor&s;e, but a &s;tout one, and we paid for this Pa&s;&s;age Three Guilders for each Per&s;on, though it was reckon'd it would take us up Two good Days travelling, by Rea&s;on that the Ways were become very bad, with much Rain which had fallen. We were to have gone from hence at Ten a Clock, but &s;taid for our Fore|man till One, who hid him&s;elf, and loiter'd, to &s;ee if the Rain would hold up, it being an ex|tream wet Morning. When we went again to our Lodging, and he thought he &s;hould lo&s;e the carrying us, he &s;oon after came to us with his Charrette. We &s;pent a good Hour in cro&s;&s;ing the Valley of <HI>Aix,</HI> as we may call it, becau&s;e that City &s;tands at one &s;ide of it. Our way through it, was upon a broad pitch'd
<PB N="286" REF="160"> Cau&s;way. It was much broken, and out of repair, and we went on very &s;lowly. On the other &s;ide of the Valley, from <HI>Aken,</HI> we met a little Brook, &s;well'd into a River with the Rains; it was ting'd of a reddi&s;h yellow Co|lour, by the Grounds that it came from. Here we pa&s;s'd through a large Village, and &s;oon af|ter mounted a Hill; the pitch'd way went a|long with us &s;till to the top of Hill, and there left us to lament the want of it, though it was none of the be&s;t, for we were no &s;ooner from it, but we expected, every length of the Char|rette, almo&s;t to be thrown into &s;ome Slough of Mud. A great part of our Way from hence towards <HI>Juliers,</HI> was through a very rich Country, full of good Enclo&s;ures, and furni&s;h'd with Orchards, Pa&s;ture-Grounds, Corn-Fields, and Hop-Grounds, but &s;ome of the dirtie&s;t Countries that ever I &s;aw in my Life. We went through a great many Villa|ges in this way to <HI>Juliers,</HI> and it &s;eems a Coun|try well peopled; but the Hou&s;es of the&s;e Villages were the wretchede&s;t that we had met with in all our Journey. They were large in|deed, but the Walls of them were of Clay unwhited. They are built with Timber, and are loftier than our common Cottages, which are of the &s;ame Colour in <HI>England.</HI> Some of them had a Gla&s;s Window, which might be cover'd with a quarter of a Yard of broad Ribbon, and a great many had none at all. They u&s;ually &s;tood with their end to the Road, and in that end, there is in the middle two great Gates, like our Barn Doors in <HI>England;</HI> a little way from that is a little Hou&s;e Door. They commonly look like the meane&s;t &s;ort of Barns
<PB N="287" REF="160"> in <HI>England.</HI> They were covered with a very thick covering of Thatch, and Clay together, which mu&s;t require good Timber to bear it.</P>
<P>We were now within the Province or Dutchy of <HI>Juliers,</HI> one of tho&s;e which makes <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dutchy of</HI> Juliers.</NOTE> up the Circle of <HI>We&s;tphalia,</HI> and were within the Dominions of the Duke of <HI>Neubourg,</HI> who is at pre&s;ent Elector Palatine.</P>
<P>The Dutchy of <HI>Juliers</HI> goes in &s;ome part of it to the <HI>Rhine,</HI> on the Ea&s;t, where it al&s;o meets, and bounds upon the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Colen;</HI> it goes to the <HI>Mae&s;e,</HI> with &s;ome part of it, on the We&s;t, where 'tis bounded with that, and the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Liege.</HI> On the South, its Limits are the Dutchies of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> and <HI>Limburg.</HI> On the North, it meets the Dutchy of <HI>Cleves.</HI> The Extent of this Dutchy is reckon'd to be about Twelve Leagues in length, and Four in breadth. The chief Cities of it are, <HI>Juliers, Dueren, Aldenhoven, Aken, Ber|chem,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>John William,</HI> Duke of <HI>Cleve, Juliers,</HI> and <HI>Mons,</HI> or <HI>Berghen,</HI> &amp;c. the la&s;t Prince of that Hou&s;e, died in the Year 1592. aged Forty Se|ven, without I&s;&s;ue. His Dutche&s;s died &s;ud|denly, in the Year 1596. <HI>Mendoza,</HI> Com|mander of the Spani&s;h Armies, invaded the Country, and notwith&s;tanding the Oppo&s;i|tion of <HI>Sibylla,</HI> Si&s;ter of the late Duke, with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance which &s;he could get from her Neighbours, he po&s;&s;e&s;s'd him&s;elf of &s;everal of the Cities of that Juri&s;diction. At length this Prince&s;s dying, the Family became ex|tinct in the Year 1609.

The&s;e Two went to fighting about the matter, the Branden|burger being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the States General of the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Neu|bourg</HI> by the Spaniards. When they were well aweary of this Sport, and could not determine the Controver&s;ie in this Way, they agreed to divide the Spoil; and the Elector of <HI>Branden|burg</HI> was allotted the Dutchy of <HI>Cleve,</HI> and the Counties of <HI>Marck,</HI> and <HI>Ravensberg;</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Neubourg,</HI> the Dutchies of <HI>Mons,</HI> or <HI>Bergen,</HI> and that of <HI>Juliers.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Altenhoven</HI> is a wall'd little City, and the Head of a Juri&s;diction round it, within the Province of <HI>Juliers,</HI> but the meane&s;t City that we had &s;een. We ob&s;erv'd the Wall to be in a ruinous Condition, and the Gate which we went in at was beaten down almo&s;t to the Ground. We went over Heaps of Rubbi&s;h in going through it. We &s;aw in our way through the City, but one Hou&s;e that look'd any thing well, and that was a Brick Building, which &s;eem'd an Inn, all the re&s;t was old and ruinous.

It is made up of a Confluence of &s;ome little Brooks which meet on the Frontiers of this Province. It runs down by <HI>Dueren,</HI> and from thence to this City, and at <HI>Roermonde</HI> (a City to which it gives that Name, becau&s;e it has there its Outlet) which belongs to the Spani&s;h <HI>Guelderland,</HI> it enters the <HI>Mae&s;e.</HI> We went over a very long Bridge upon this River, ju&s;t before we enter'd <HI>Juliers;</HI> it is built of Tim|ber, and on the upper &s;ide of it, again&s;t the Stream, there was &s;et very great Piles of Wood, which were lock'd fa&s;t to the Timber of the Bridge, and from thence went down &s;launting into the Water. The River was mightily &s;well'd with the Rain, and with great Noi&s;e hardly went under the Bridge. It was deeply ting'd with a reddi&s;h yellow, the Co|lour of the Soil of the Country.

<P>Between Seven and Eight a Clock at Night we came into this City; it is but little, but a very ancient City. Some Authors think it was built by <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar;</HI> others think it was the Work of <HI>Dru&s;us,</HI> the Son-in-Law of <HI>Au|gu&s;tus
<PB N="290" REF="162"> Cae&s;ar,</HI> who for his Conque&s;ts upon the German People was call'd <HI>Germanicus.</HI> It is the head City of this Dutchy.

It is now well fortified, having about it a good Wall, and a Ditch, and it is defended by a &s;trong Ci|tadel, all which things &s;eem to be in a good Condition, and we found a good Garri&s;on of Soldiers in it. The Streets are mo&s;t of them &s;trait and broad, &s;o that one &s;ees the Wall at one or both ends of them.

<PB N="291" REF="162"> there &s;tood upon their Carriages Three little Images, dre&s;s'd fine, which had been carried in a Proce&s;&s;ion on the <HI>Sunday</HI> before, being <HI>Trinity Sunday,</HI> and perhaps were to repre&s;ent to the People, the Trinity whom they were to wor&s;hip.

Then they had Mill&s;tones fa&s;tned to their Necks, and they were ca&s;t into the River. They ro&s;e from the bottom of the

A Caldron full of melted Lead was prepar'd for them, and they thrown, bound Hand and Foot, in|to it: As the Executioners were throwing them in, they call'd for the Divine Vengeance upon <HI>Rictiovarus,</HI> upon which a drop of the melted Lead flew up, and alighted upon his Eye, which forthwith bur&s;t.

This Deliverance &s;o vexed their Per&s;ecutor, that he for Madne&s;s threw him|&s;elf into the Fire. And here their Story ends, for it is not &s;aid how, or when they came to their Deaths at la&s;t.

For by the Stories of Acts and Miracles, apparently feign'd, which they have mingled with the Truth, they have di&s;credited what is true, and &s;ullied the Glory of their Sufferings. It is ob&s;ervable here, that they make the&s;e Men a very &s;orry &s;ort of Saints or Martyrs, when they &s;ay they flew upon their Tormentours, and kill'd as many as they could of them, and that they imprecated a Vengeance upon <HI>Rictiova|rus:</HI>

<P>When we came into the City we heard a <NOTE PLACE="marg">Bells.</NOTE> mighty Noi&s;e of Bells, which they were jang|ling, after their Fa&s;hion, in the great Church: We went in, as &s;oon as we could, and found a Per&s;on there to enquire of, what the Occa&s;ion or Rea&s;on of this &s;hould be; for we knew it was not to call People together to Church at this time.

And this calls to mind what I have el&s;ewhere ob&s;erv'd, that when there has been a Storm of Thunder and Lightning, which has continued a while, all the Bells in a great City have been jangled and clatter'd to drive it away. This &s;illy u&s;e of their Bells the People are taught by the Forms of ble&s;&s;ing them before they are hung up; &s;omething of which it may not be ami&s;s to in|&s;ert here. There is requir'd a Bi&s;hop and a Dea|con to the Performance of this &s;olemn and important Bu&s;ine&s;s. They both mu&s;t be in
<PB N="294" REF="164"> their Habits proper to Officiate in. The Bell mu&s;t be hung &s;o as it may be gone round, and may be touched within and without. The Bi|&s;hop mu&s;t be provided with an adorn'd Chair to &s;it on, and with Water to be con&s;ecrated, with a Whisk to &s;prinkle it upon occa&s;ion, with a Salt&s;eller, and Salt in it, with a clean Cloth to wipe the Bell when nece&s;&s;ary, with a Ve&s;|&s;el of Holy Oyl of the Sick; with the Holy Chri&s;m, which is the con&s;ecrated Oyl for Con|firmation, and with Myrrh and Frankincen&s;e, and an Incen&s;e-Pot, with Fire in it. Thus pro|vided he goes to Work, and after a great deal of cro&s;&s;ing and conjuring, he &s;ays this, among other fooli&s;h Prayers, to the &s;ame purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><Q>O God, who did&s;t direct thy Servant <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> to to make Silver Trumpets, with which, while the Priests &s;ounded at the Time of the Sacri|fice, the People by the &s;weet &s;ound might be admoni&s;h'd and prepared to wor&s;hip thee, and to come together to the Celebration of the Sa|crifice; and by the noi&s;e of which being en|courag'd to the Battel, they might overcome the Endeavours of their Enemies: Grant, we be&s;eech thee, that this Ve&s;&s;el prepar'd for thy Holy Church may be &cross; &s;anctified (at the &s;peak|ing that Word he makes the Sign of the Cro&s;s upon the Bell) by the Holy Gho&s;t, that by the striking of this thy Faithful People may be invited to their Reward: And when the Melody of it &s;ounds in the Ears of the Peo|ple they may be encreas'd in the Devotion of Faith; all machinations of the Enemy, the ratling of Hail, the &s;torm of Whirlwinds, the violence of Tempe&s;ts, may be drove away;
<PB N="295" REF="164"> that mi&s;cheivous Thunders may be quieted, the blasts of Winds render'd helpful and mo|derate; that the Right Hand of thy Power may conquer all the Powers of the Air, and they hearing the &s;ound of this Bell may trem|ble and fly before the Banner of the Holy Cro&s;s of thy Son drawn upon it, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Bells may without doubt be lawfully u&s;ed to admoni&s;h and call together the A&s;&s;embly to the wor&s;hip of God, as the Trumpets were by the Prie&s;ts in the Jewi&s;h Temple, and thus far we follow the Pattern which God him&s;elf has &s;et us: But this does not content Super&s;tition, it will in &s;ome things go beyond what it has any Ground for, as in other Ca&s;es it &s;cruples and declines what it might do. If there had been any Intimation in the Law of God by <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> that the Prie&s;ts Trumpets &s;hould have &s;uch Effects as the&s;e, we might rea&s;onably enough hope that our Bells would have the &s;ame, that the Go&s;pel Di&s;pen&s;ation might not, in any important Privilege, come behind the Jewi&s;h; but we find nothing of this, and therefore we leave this &s;uper&s;titious U&s;e of Bells to the Papi&s;ts; while we teach and en|deavour rather that our Conformity to the Laws of the Go&s;pel may render the Divine Providence favourable to us. 'Tis certainly a great Snare to the World, to be taught that they may by any &s;uch fooli&s;h and conjuring Tricks, procure the Divine Favours, rather than by the Exerci&s;es of Faith and good Li|ving, and it commonly betrays them to the neglect of the&s;e Means. Something to be &s;ure was in the way, for notwith&s;tanding all this

<P>COn&s;idering them, we got up very early the next Morning, having a long and tedi|ous Journey, as the Ways were, to reach to <HI>Colen.</HI> We pa&s;&s;ed through a Valley for about the &s;pace of half an Hour, upon a pav'd Cu&s;|way, from <HI>Juliers,</HI> between rich Pa&s;tures and Corn-Fields. Then we gradually mounted to a higher Country, but the Soil being a &s;ort of Clay, it was very wet &s;till. Soon after our a&s;cending, we enter'd a va&s;t Wood, which our Foreman or Charioteer call'd the Wood of <HI>Steintra&s;&s;e,</HI> from a Village of that Name, which <NOTE PLACE="marg">Steintra&s;|&s;e.</NOTE> we pa&s;s'd through at the edge of it. There was a very broad Track through the Wood, which is the Road, and it is pretty &s;trait, &s;o that we commonly could &s;ee &s;ome Miles before us; but as broad as the Road was, we could hardly pick out a tolerable Path, the Ground was every where &s;o &s;oft and full of Water. The tall Wood was chiefly Oak and Beach; there was a great deal of Underwood, for the mo&s;t part, and that was Alder chiefly, which grows on moi&s;t Grounds be&s;t; all the Wood &s;eem'd very flouri&s;hing, and large in its kind. There were cut in this Wood many Thou|&s;ands of Palli&s;ado's, I &s;uppo&s;e de&s;ign'd by the Government for the Improvement of &s;ome Fortifications. In all this Pa&s;&s;age, which was
<PB N="297" REF="165"> of &s;everal Hours through this Wood, we &s;aw to wild Bea&s;t, though without doubt there are of &s;everal &s;orts here, only one Deer walk'd cro&s;s the Road at a di&s;tance before us. We &s;pent I believe, at our &s;low Rate of travelling, Three Hours in and by this Wood.</P>
<P>This Village of <HI>Steintra&s;&s;e</HI> was all over Mud and Dirt. The People trod almo&s;t to the mid-Leg in Dirt when they &s;tept out of their Hou|&s;es. The Walls of their Hou&s;es were unwhi|ted Clay, and the Cover Thatch and Clay mingled. We &s;aw on one &s;ide &s;ome plough'd Grounds belonging to the Village.</P>
<P>About Eleven a Clock before Noon we came to the River <HI>Erpe,</HI> or <HI>Erffe,</HI> which we <NOTE PLACE="marg">Erpe <HI>Ri|ver.</HI></NOTE> were to pa&s;s to <HI>Berghem,</HI> on the other &s;ide of it. This River ri&s;es on the Frontires of this Dutchy, Southward, and runs into the <HI>Rhine</HI> by <HI>Nuys,</HI> in the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Colen.</HI> It was now exorbitantly &s;well'd by the Rains, and put us in &s;ome Care how we &s;hould get over it. There is a Foot Cau&s;way rais'd a little through the Meadows, which goes to a &s;mall bridge over the River, but now Bridge and Cau&s;way both were cover'd with Water. And though it was common for Charrettes with their Pa&s;&s;engers to ford it conveniently enough, we could not have done this now without be|ing wet, even in our Charrette, almo&s;t to the Wa&s;te; and be&s;ides, our Hor&s;e, who mu&s;t for &s;ometime &s;wim, would have been hard put to it to have had any thing more to draw be|&s;ides the Charrette and Driver. We therefore, with the Company of Two other Charrettes, went into a &s;orry <HI>Naken</HI> to be ferry'd over. The River run very fierce, but we went cro&s;s
<PB N="298" REF="166"> on the lower &s;ide of the Foot Cau&s;way, which &s;omewhat defended us from the force of the Stream. We got over &s;afe, Thanks be to God, and went to our Dinner at <HI>Berghen,</HI> while we left our Foreman and his Hor&s;e to take theirs on the other &s;ide. This is a &s;mall wall'd City, but &s;eems poor and incon&s;iderable, but is the head of a &s;mall Juri&s;diction about it. Here is a Synagogue of Jews publickly tolerated.</P>
<P>After Dinner we pur&s;ued our Journey, tho' very &s;lowly, becau&s;e our Hor&s;e fell &s;ick. And be&s;ides this, after we had gone a little way upon a Level we began to mount the Hills, which we &s;aw when we were on the other &s;ide of the River. We could &s;ee this Ridge of Hills for a great length together, both upwards, and down the River, and it &s;eem'd to go on both Ways beyond our &s;ight, Northward and Southward. It lies along very &s;teep on this &s;ide, towards this River, which occa&s;ions a &s;udden &s;hoot of the Water from it, and by con&s;equence the great &s;wel|ling of this River. The&s;e Hills are, however, in many Places &s;uch, as that they are plow'd and &s;own, and there are Orchards and Pa&s;ture-Grounds upon them to &s;erve the Villages, which are thick &s;et upon them. And the&s;e are &s;helter'd by frequent Woods which po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;teepe&s;t Parts of the Hills. When we had mounted upwards above an Hour, and ob|&s;erv'd that the Country ro&s;e &s;till above us, and that our Hor&s;e grew more faint, we took pity upon him, and contented our &s;elves, &s;ince we could not po&s;&s;ibly get to <HI>Colen</HI> with him this Night, to re&s;t here, that he might not be too far &s;pent, and might be the better able to car|ry
<PB N="299" REF="166"> us on the next Morning. We were the rather induced to this, becau&s;e the Weather was now clear'd up, and we were in hopes the re&s;t of the Afternoon would be fair, and we were got a good way up the We&s;tern &s;ide of the Hill, on which the Sun now &s;hone very plea&s;antly, we could have a large Pro&s;pect a|bout the Country, and were upon a good dry Place for walking: And to all this, after we had enquired at &s;everal Hou&s;es in this &s;cattering Village, and were denied, at length we came to one which promis'd us a Bed. It was a new Hou&s;e too, and &s;o, we &s;uppo&s;ed, might not be &s;o na&s;ty as the old ones &s;eem'd to be. Be&s;ides, we were promis'd here, that if our Hor&s;e &s;hould not be able to travel next Mor|ning, the Hou&s;e would furni&s;h us with a good <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ichen|dorp.</NOTE> one that &s;hould do our Bu&s;ine&s;s. The Name of this Village is <HI>Ichendorp.</HI> It lies &s;catter'd a|bout in &s;everal Patches of Hou&s;es, di&s;tant from one another, on this &s;ide of the Hill. They have a hand&s;ome large Church, built of Brick. I had a mind to &s;ee both the Country Par&s;on, and his Church. It co&s;t me a Mile's walk to find his Dwelling. I came to a &s;orry Hou&s;e, where they told me he lodg'd, but he was not within; &s;o I could &s;ee neither. I &s;pent &s;ome time of the Afternoon in walking among the Woods which were near our Lodg|ing, and from thence had a large View of the Country. Here Nightingales and other &s;ing|ing Birds abound, and at this time fill'd the Woods with their charming Mu&s;ick. We went by Day-light to our Bed, which we found a very &s;orry one, and therefore lay down in our Cloaths, as in like Ca&s;es we were often
<PB N="300" REF="167"> forc'd to do in this Journey. We had one Relief in the Badne&s;s of our Lodging, that if we could not &s;leep, we were entertain'd with the Nightingales in the neighbouring Woods, who &s;ung &s;weetly all the Night. We rou&s;ed betimes, and found our Hor&s;e &s;omewhat re|cruited, and thought able to carry us to <HI>Colen;</HI> and in the &s;pace of Six Hours he brought us thither with much ado. From our Lodging we a&s;cended a good while. Towards the top of the Hill, we found our &s;elves in a Wood, and had &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive A&s;cents in that. We were &s;ome Hours upon this Ridge of Hills, before we came to look down on the other &s;ide of it; and we pa&s;s'd through &s;ome Villages and manur'd Grounds, intermingled with the Woods. At length we came on the other &s;ide, where we could &s;ee <HI>Colen.</HI></P>
<P>The De&s;cent on this &s;ide was more gradual than our A&s;cent on the other, the fall of the Ground being not &s;o &s;teep and &s;udden. To|wards the bottom of the Hills we turn'd out of the Road to &s;ome neighbouring Villages, to find a better way cro&s;s the Valley, which we did, and had &s;ome Plea&s;ure in this part of our Journey. This Valley is, I believe, Four or Five Miles broad in the Place where we enter'd upon it, and was in all our way plow'd and &s;own, and open. We went between &s;ome of the riche&s;t, fine&s;t Crops of Wheat and Rye that I had, I believe, ever &s;een in my Life. The Soil is a good Mould, but perhaps a little of the drie&s;t, whence this wet Sea&s;on made the be&s;t of it. Within a Mile of <HI>Colen</HI> we came into our mi&s;erable Road again, and found it &s;uch, as we had Rea&s;on to wi&s;h we could have
<PB N="301" REF="167"> gone &s;till be&s;ides it. I &s;uppo&s;e the extream Badne&s;s of the&s;e Ways to be together with the ill Weather, from their being much fre|quented with heavy Carriages, which pa&s;s from <HI>Colen</HI> up into the Country, with &s;everal &s;orts of Goods; and, I believe, <HI>Aix la Chap|pelle</HI> is furni&s;h'd, be&s;ides other Places, with ma|ny things from hence, e&s;pecially in the time of Year when tho&s;e Baths are re&s;orted to. We &s;aw in this part of our Journey &s;ome part of Three &s;everal Proce&s;&s;ions in the Villages we pa&s;s'd through, for this was a great Day of Proce&s;&s;ions with the Romi&s;h Church, as will be ob&s;erv'd in the following Section.</P>

<HEAD>COLEN.</HEAD>
<P>We came to this City about Eleven a Clock. I write the Name as we commonly &s;peak it in <HI>England.</HI> The Low Dutch call it <HI>Ceulen;</HI> the People of the Country, <HI>Coln;</HI> the French, <HI>Cologne:</HI> The Latines have always call'd it <HI>Colonia Ubiorum,</HI> and <HI>Colonia Agrippina,</HI> which Names they give it, with relation to the Be|ginnings of it. The&s;e are briefly commemo|rated by In&s;criptions in Latin over a large Por|tico at the Front and Entrance of their Se|nate-Hou&s;e. I &s;hall &s;omewhat more largely re|late what is &s;aid of the Original of this City, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Original.</NOTE> as follows.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ubians,</HI> a People of <HI>Germany,</HI> on the other &s;ide of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> who dwelt along the oppo&s;ite Bank of it, from <HI>Mentz,</HI> down to this Place, were grievou&s;ly infe&s;ted with the Incur|&s;ions of &s;ome neighbouring People, who were too &s;trong for them. The In&s;cription here
<PB N="302" REF="168"> calls them the <HI>Suevi,</HI> who were thus trouble|&s;ome. Some call them the <HI>Chatti,</HI> or <HI>Catti,</HI> or <HI>Cha&s;&s;i.</HI> They were &s;eated beyond the Country of the <HI>Ubians,</HI> from the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and all along on their Borders. The <HI>Ubians</HI> vexed, and almo&s;t oppre&s;s'd by this People, &s;ought the Alliance of <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> and his A&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the&s;e their Enemies. But whether they were a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Romans or not they grew by this Di&s;turbance a weary of their Country; and in the time of <HI>Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar,</HI> were, upon their De&s;ire, brought over the <HI>Rhine</HI> to this &s;ide, under the Conduct of M. <HI>Vi&s;panius Agrippa,</HI> Con&s;ul. The <HI>Chatti</HI> im|mediately fell into, and took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Country which they left. Tis thought the <HI>U|bians</HI> pa&s;s'd the <HI>Rhine</HI> about this Place, and that this was about Twenty, or Twenty Five Years before our Saviour's Birth. When they were come over, &s;ome &s;ay, they built this City for the Head of their Nation. Others will have it, that there was a City here before the <HI>Ubians</HI> came over, and do carry up the Original of it into Ob&s;curity, as all that affect Antiquity do. This Nation extended them&s;elves on this &s;ide, over the greate&s;t part of the Dutchy of <HI>Juliers,</HI> reaching to to the Banks of the River <HI>Roer,</HI> forementioned, and al&s;o over the great|e&s;t part of the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Colen.</HI> After the&s;e things, <HI>Julia Agrippina,</HI> the Grand-Daughter of that <HI>Agrippa,</HI> and the Mother of <HI>Nero,</HI> having been born at <HI>Colen,</HI> and being de|&s;irous to &s;how the Power which &s;he had, by virtue of her &s;econd Marriage, which was with <HI>Claudius</HI> the Emperor, cau&s;ed the Compa&s;s of the City to be enlarged, and towards the

<P>In all this here appears no Engagement of Subjection on one &s;ide, or Pretence to Authority on the other; and the thing looks more like an Agreement between Allies, than an Acknowledgment, or accepting of Sove|reignty. It is evident the Archbi&s;hip is not to be accounted the Supream Governour, or Sovereign of this City; but the Sovereign Power is properly lodg'd in the Senate; and to them the People make no &s;uch con|ditional Promi&s;e of Subjection. Indeed, it were ab&s;urd and unrea&s;onable that any &s;uch &s;hould be implied or expre&s;t in the Peoples Acknowledgment of the Sovereign. For this Fancy in the Heads of the People, that they are no longer bound to be &s;ubject, than while the Power rules them well, and pre|&s;erves all their Rights and Properties, gives
<PB N="306" REF="170"> them the Pride of Cen&s;uring the Actions of their Rulers, and they will condemn and di&s;like for the mo&s;t part, and certainly and always whatever they do not under&s;tand; and there is no wi&s;e Government but will do and order many things which the Peo|ple mu&s;t not under&s;tand till they have their Effects, that the Good they de&s;ign by them may not be prevented. This Fancy makes them very apt to be jealous and &s;u&s;picious of the De&s;igns of their Governours. Be|&s;ides, there is no State which is de&s;titute of ill Men, &s;ome of whom will have De&s;igns of Revenge and Mi&s;chief upon others, &s;ome will have De&s;igns of Covetou&s;ne&s;s and Am|bition; and all &s;uch, for the &s;ake of accom|pli&s;hing tho&s;e De&s;igns, will be fond of ha|ving them&s;elves a &s;hare in the Government; and to that purpo&s;e they will be continual|ly allarming the People with Fears and Jea|lou&s;ies, mi&s;interpeting the Actions and De|&s;igns of the Governours, and repre&s;enting they do infringe their Rights, or tend to get Power to do it; and then they form a Faction, which by Degrees may grow &s;trong enough for Sedition and Rebellion. Thus the Supream Power becomes fir&s;t too weak to govern, and to give the People the Fe|licity of a good Government, and when they de&s;ign well, things &s;hall, through the Perver&s;ne&s;s of the People, &s;ucceed ill, and be imputed to ill De&s;igns; and the Good which they do not, becau&s;e they cannot, &s;hall be thought neglected, becau&s;e they would not do it. Then the People grow mad enough to venture the dangerous Ex|periment
<PB N="307" REF="170"> of changing Governours, or Forms of Government; and then the&s;e ill Men gain their own Ends.

<P>We came to <HI>Colen</HI> upon a very great Ho|ly-Day, with tho&s;e of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> that is, what they call <HI>Sacraments-Day,</HI> or
<PB N="312" REF="173"> the Fea&s;t of the Holy Sacrament. For they <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sacraments D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">y, and the Proce&s;|&s;ions.</NOTE> do yearly, on the <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> after <HI>Trinity Sun|day,</HI> as this was with them, commemorate the In&s;titution of the Lord's Supper. And we came hither in a good time to &s;ee the Pro|ce&s;&s;ions of this Day, which are &s;ome of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t &s;olemn Proce&s;&s;ions of the whole Year. As we were going to our Inn, we met one which &s;taid us almo&s;t an Hour to &s;ee it pa&s;s by. The Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> march'd foremo&s;t in this Proce&s;&s;ion, carried and attended by Quea&s;ils &s;inging, if it be proper to call an Image her; which yet we may do, when we are giving an Account of their Matters, becau&s;e they them&s;elves do &s;o; and an Image in any Place is call'd the Vir|gin <HI>Mary</HI> of that Place. The Image of her at <HI>Loretto,</HI> is as famous among them, under the Name of our <HI>Lady of Loretto,</HI> as that of <HI>Diana</HI> at <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> was under the Name of <HI>Diana of the Ephe&s;ians.</HI> But may it not be &s;aid, that this Phra&s;e implies plainly, that they believe the Image not only a Repre|&s;entation of the Saint, but a Symbol of her Pre&s;ence in &s;uch a Place. This Image was but &s;mall, about the height of a Child of Three or Four Years old, but dre&s;t very fine, with a Robe of Cloth of Silver, a Crown on her Head, and a Scepter in her Hand. After this, &s;everal other Images were carried, of He and She-Saints, intermix'd with Banners, which are commonly long taper'd Flags, with a Picture of &s;ome Saint in the broad part of them. At the end of the Pole they hang upon, is commonly fa&s;t|ned a good large Cro&s;s of Silver. There were
<PB N="313" REF="173"> &s;everal Images of the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> carried, one of which, as big as a Child of Two Years old, &s;eem'd, and was &s;aid to be, all ma&s;&s;y Silver, that was carry'd by Six Men. There attended this Proce&s;&s;ion Two Religious Or|ders of Men, the <HI>Franci&s;cans</HI> and the <HI>Au|guctines,</HI> the&s;e la&s;t &s;ung as they went along. Many Men and Women of good Fa&s;hion appear'd in this Train. After all the Images, came the Men who honour'd the Ho&s;tie, by carrying lighted Flambeaux's before it. They march'd Two and Two in great Or|der, and were a great while a going by. I doubt not there were &s;everal Hundreds of them. Several genteel little Boys went ring|ing their Silver Bells before the Ho&s;tie. The Canopy over that was of Silk, with a rich Gold and Silver Fringe hanging down from it. A Secular Prie&s;t carried the Ho|&s;tie, in his Surplice and Cope, his Cope richly embroider'd with Gold and Silver. The Remon&s;tranter was large, with a great. deal of Work in it, and of Silver gilt.</P>
<P>Let us make a few Reflections upon the&s;e Matters, before we pa&s;s on to other things. The Council of <HI>Trent</HI> has e&s;tabli&s;h'd and au|thoriz'd the&s;e Things. It &s;ays, The Wor&s;hip due to the True God, ought to be given to the mo&s;t Holy Sacrament. And it is a Cu|&s;tome very piou&s;ly and religiou&s;ly brought into the Church; That every Year, on a certain particular Fe&s;tival-Day, this Emi|nent and Venerable Sacrament be celebra|ted with &s;ingular Veneration, and Solemni|ty, and that it be reverently and honoura|bly carried about in Proce&s;&s;ions through
<PB N="314" REF="174"> the Streets and publick Ways; and it cur|&s;es tho&s;e who &s;hall contradict and condemn the&s;e Things. But we &s;hall venture to do this, however, being a&s;&s;ur'd that the Cur&s;e cau&s;ele&s;s will not come.</P>
<P>As for this Fe&s;tival, they do them&s;elves <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fe|&s;tival.</NOTE> confe&s;s, that it has no Te&s;timony or Foun|dation in Scripture, or Apo&s;tolical Traditi|on, or even in the Hi&s;tory of the Primi|tive Church for &s;everal Ages. It is cer|tain, and granted, that <HI>Urban</HI> the fourth Pope of <HI>Rome,</HI> introduc'd it about the Year of our Lord 1260<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> And his Pretence for &s;o doing was, that it had been reveal'd to &s;ome Per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ons, that &s;uch a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">val &s;hould be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> and generally ob&s;erv'd, which is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> Pretence for many of the ab&s;urd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="3 letters">vorious of the Roman Church. He does not &s;ay this was reveal'd to him; but certainly, if Je&s;us Chri&s;t had intended that &s;uch a thing &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;h'd, and conform'd to by his whole Church, he would have reveal'd his Will in this matter rather to the Pope him&s;elf immediately, than to any one el&s;e; if indeed Je&s;us Chri&s;t did him|&s;elf own the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Rome</HI> for his Vicar on Earth, and the vi&s;ible Head, and infal|lible Guide of his Church here. It is ano|ther ju&s;t Prejudice again&s;t this Fe&s;tival, that it confirms and countenances the maiming of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">is Ble&s;&s;ed Sacrament in the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> They pretend on this Occa&s;ion to produce and &s;how, and to Venerate and Honour the mo&s;t Holy Sacrament, when all they do regards only one Element of it, the Bread. It is another ju&s;t Prejudice again&s;t
<PB N="315" REF="174"> this Fe&s;tival, that it diverts the Sacrament from its true U&s;e, and the Purpo&s;e which it was by Je&s;us Chri&s;t in&s;tituted and ap|pointed for, and propo&s;es That to be &s;een only and wor&s;hipped, and honour'd with Lights in a Proce&s;&s;ion, which was ordain'd to be reverently and devoutly receiv'd.</P>
<P>As for the Adoration of this part of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Adoration of the H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tie.</NOTE> Holy Sacrament; as they of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> teach and practice this, it cann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters"> po&s;|&s;ibly be excus'd from the Guilt of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">orrid Idolatry. They &s;ay, the very Sacrament is to be wor&s;hipped; all that which our Sa|viour in&s;tituted to be receiv'd; and that it ought to have paid to it the very Adora|tion and Wor&s;hip which is due to God him&s;elf. They urge indeed for this the Adorations which were paid to our Saviour when he was on Earth; and &s;ay, that he is per&s;onally pre&s;ent in the Ho&s;tie, with his Body and Blood, and therefore ought to be ador'd there. But, without di&s;puting the manner of our Saviour's Pre&s;ence in that Sa|crament, which is certainly inexplicable, we may &s;ay, that tho&s;e who ador'd our Saviour on Earth, did not adore his Cloaths too, but only his excellent Per&s;on, as he was Son of God. But here they enjoin the Adora|tion of the Species, or Appearance of the Bread, which they mu&s;t allow at lea&s;t to remain, and which is, according their Ex|plication of the matter, to his Body in the Sacrament, what his Cloaths were to it on Earth, that is, the Covering of it. Yea, moreover we will venture to &s;ay, they adore the Elements them&s;elves of Bread and Wine,
<PB N="316" REF="175"> becau&s;e of his Pre&s;ence with them. 'Tis true, they pretend that the Sub&s;tances of the&s;e vani&s;h upon Con&s;ecration, and are there no more; but as matter of Fact has often confuted this, in the Corruption of the Wafers when they are kept too long; &s;o they &s;eem to confe&s;s the Fal&s;hood of it in the Rules of the Pa&s;toral. Where they &s;ay, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to keep the Euchari&s;t in the Sacri&s;ty, for the Communion of the Sick; but lea&s;t the Species &s;hould be cor|rupted, if kept long, the Prie&s;t is com|manded to take out the old Ho&s;ties of|ten, and to put in new ones. This he can well enough do, by eating him&s;elf, or giving to tho&s;e that receive, the old ones which were con&s;ecrated formerly, and by putting in their Places tho&s;e which at that Ma&s;s he con&s;ecrates anew. Now this Cor|ruption which they take this Care to pre|vent, is what indeed the Sub&s;tances of Bread and Wine may be liable to; but the im|mortal Body of our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour can|not be &s;o; therefore we certainly have not that here in the &s;tead and place of the Sub&s;tances of the Bread and Wine. Be|&s;ides, the Holy Scripture teaches us, that the&s;e remain after Con&s;ecration, and that 'tis &s;till Bread and Wine which are taken, ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">en, and drank in the Participation of this Sacrament. They wor&s;hip therefore mo&s;t certainly the&s;e very Creatures, of Bread and Wine, with Divine Wor&s;hip, in adoring the Holy Sacrament. We do ju&s;tly own, that our Saviour Chri&s;t, who is God as well as Man, is to be wor&s;hipped, as pre&s;ent, in
<PB N="317" REF="175"> the receiving of this Sacrament, and accor|dingly we do then wor&s;hip him. But we mu&s;t under&s;tand, that the Promi&s;e of his Pre&s;ence in, and with this Sacrament<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">, re|lates, and is con&s;in'd, to that U&s;e of it which he has appointed it for; and if any will pre&s;ume to put it to any other U&s;e than that, they cannot, from any Word of his, promi&s;e them&s;elves his Pre&s;ence with it: But they require and encourage the Adora|tion of the Bread, out of the Sacramental and Appointed U&s;e of it, in the Streets, and where they do not pretend to receive it.</P>
<P>Their Proce&s;&s;ions are, as they &s;ay, of &s;e|veral <NOTE PLACE="marg">Proce&s;&s;ions.</NOTE> Sorts; &s;ome of them are for Thank&s;|giving to God or the Saints, for Favours receiv'd; &s;ome are of Penitence, and to a|vert the Calamities which they are under, or do fear. They carry the Images of the Saints, and &s;ometimes their Relicks, in the&s;e to honour the Saints. I have &s;een, though not at this time, here, that on this Day there have been fine Altars &s;et up in the Streets where the Proce&s;&s;ion was to be, and there, when the Ho&s;tie came to the Place, it was &s;et up, and he that carried it perform'd &s;ome Devotions; all the People who attended the Proce&s;&s;ion being the while fallen on their Knees in the Street. When they go in Pe|nitence they &s;ay they do this to make &s;ome Satisfaction for their Crimes, and to pray to God for his Mercy and Forgivene&s;s, in the Company of the Saints, who&s;e Images they carry, that they may be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by their Prayers al&s;o, and &s;o be the more likely to &s;ucceed. 'Tis well confe&s;s'd. It &s;eems then,
<PB N="318" REF="176"> by this Explication of the matter, they reck|on they have the Company of the Saints, when they have the Pre&s;ence of their Ima|ges; they judge them in a manner link'd together. This was the very Opinion which the Heathens had of their Images, and the Foundation of the Veneration which they paid to, and of the U&s;e which they made of them. Indeed this Pomp of Proce&s;&s;ions, and carrying the Images of the Saints, is an old Heatheni&s;h dete&s;table Rite, reviv'd in the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> The Cu&s;tom and Name of the&s;e things are taken from the Heathen Romans. The Emperors, when they went to any publick Devotion, were &s;aid to go in Proce&s;&s;ion, and they were at|tended with a pompous Train. <HI>Dis Choul</HI> hone&s;tly gives the following Account of the Heathen Proce&s;&s;ions, and makes them paral|lel to the Popi&s;h ones. It was the Office of the Prie&s;t (&s;ays he) to make Supplica|tions, which we call Proce&s;&s;ions; that they might give Thanks to their <HI>Demons</HI> for a Victory gain'd, and &s;ometimes that they might avert the Anger of the Gods. And when the Prie&s;ts made their Supplications through the Streets, they carried the Image of <HI>Jupiter;</HI> and in &s;everal Places they &s;et up this Image, in a Place prepar'd for it. Which thing, &s;ays he, is &s;till done in <HI>France,</HI> on the Day of the Holy Sacrament, <HI>(Rel. Vet.

<P>After Ve&s;pers, in the Afternoon, a Je&s;uite <NOTE PLACE="marg">Je&s;uites.</NOTE> preach'd in the great Church, call'd the <HI>Dome.</HI> He had a va&s;t Congregation of all &s;orts of People, and laid about very vigo|rou&s;ly with his Hands and his Tongue, for about Three quarters of an Hour. He preach'd cover'd, as the Popi&s;h Clergy and the French Prote&s;tants do: The former, as Fathers dictating to their Children; the lat|ter, as Emba&s;&s;adors from God to the Peo|ple, which by this &s;ignificant Ceremony, and a very Popi&s;h one, they repre&s;ent; they think indeed of their coming from God, but not of coming with him, or that they deliver his Me&s;&s;age in his Sight and Pre&s;ence. 'Tis indeed that to which cor|rupted Nature is very liable and prone, to honour it &s;elf, even rather than the Great God; and 'tis no wonder if it affects, and chu&s;es to put on the Authority of repre|&s;enting him, rather than the Humility of reverencing him; or if the former makes them forget and neglect the latter, even in a Ca&s;e where they might be join'd toge|ther. The Je&s;uite, when ever he mention'd the Holy Sacrament, the Subject of his Di&s;cour&s;e, pull'd off his Cap. We could under&s;tand but &s;ome Words of his Di&s;cour&s;e, becau&s;e he preach'd in High Dutch. When he had done, great part of his Congrega|tion, and we, among the re&s;t, went down from this Church to the Je&s;uites Chappel, they to fini&s;h the Devotion of this great Day, and we to &s;ee it done. A multitude
<PB N="320" REF="177"> of People were gather'd thither, many Coaches &s;tood about the Door, and we were crowded in going in before they begun. We got into one of the Galleries where we could &s;ee all that was done, without complying. The whole Service was perform'd in Mu&s;ick, but it begun and ended with a general &s;inging of the whole Congregation, which I had not &s;een before among the Roma|ni&s;ts. And that which made this the more charming, was this, The Je&s;uites had planted all their Scholars, which were a great Num|ber, in the Allies of the Three I&s;les of the Church, there they kneel'd in Rows from one end to the other of the Church, which is a large one. They were taught to &s;ing, and perhaps had &s;ome to lead them. They &s;ung very exactly, in time with the Organ, and other Mu&s;ick, and made alto|gether a very plea&s;ant Harmony. The fine harmonious Singing of the whole Congre|gations of the Lutherans, who abound in <HI>Germany,</HI> and &s;pend much of the time of Publick Wor&s;hip, in &s;inging altogether, be|fore and after Sermon, their P&s;alms, and Hymns and Spiritual Songs, has made the Je&s;uites betake them&s;elves to this mo&s;t plea|&s;ant Cu&s;tom; whereas ordinarily, in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> the Quire, or the Organ Gallery alone, make the Mu&s;ick, and all the Congregation mu&s;t only &s;ilently hear it.</P>
<P>At the beginning of this Service, call'd <HI>Compline on H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">lidays,</HI> they commonly give the Benediction of the Holy Sacrament, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Benedi|ction of the Holy Sa|crament.</NOTE> do the &s;ame again at the Conclu&s;ion. This we conveniently &s;aw here, in the following
<PB N="321" REF="177"> manner: The Prie&s;t in a grave, &s;olemn Pace, brings the Ho&s;tie upon the Stage, with lighted Tapers, and little Bells ringing, carried before him; he &s;ets him&s;elf in the middle of the Stage, with his Face towards the People, holding his Remon&s;tranter with the Ho&s;tie in it before him towards the People, and moves it and him&s;elf &s;ucce&s;&s;ively &s;omewhat towards each &s;ide of the Church; while he &s;tands and does this, all the Congregation are upon their Knees, and all were here &s;inging: At length he gravely &s;ets it upon the Altar, makes his &s;crape to it, and then comes down to the Steps, and there kneels with his Face towards it during the Service; in which he has no|thing to do when 'tis perform'd in Mu&s;ick, but only to &s;ay a Prayer or two, during which the Mu&s;ick cea&s;es; but with a curious Flou|ri&s;h of all the &s;orts of Mu&s;ick together it &s;ounds the <HI>Amen.</HI> While the Service was performing, we could ob&s;erve the Church. The Prie&s;t, who officiated, was cover'd with a very rich Cope, on which one could &s;ee nothing but Gold and Silver: Had we been near enough, perhaps we might have &s;een &s;tore of Pearls &s;et in the embroidery, which &s;ometimes, poor Men, the Prie&s;ts of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> are wont to have. The Remon&s;tranter was a very large one, and the Work of it very Curious; it was, I &s;uppo&s;e, of Silver gilt with Gold. The Ornament be|fore the Altar was Cloth of Silver, but with a broad and embroidery of Gold laid up|on it in the form of three or four great Ar|ches or Portals, under every Arch was wrought an Image of &s;ome Saint, and behind him there
<PB N="322" REF="178"> was a Pro&s;pect of Land&s;chape. This Altar was &s;et off with a great deal of Riches, had many Silver Candle&s;ticks with tall Wax Ta|pers lighted in them, and many other things for Ornament of Silver, or gilded and coun|terfeiting Silver and Gold, and all the&s;e things were very artificially intermix'd as is u&s;ual with bundles of Flowers. The Architecture of Marble above the Altar is in three Stories as it were, every one &s;omewhat le&s;s from the lowermo&s;t; they include three Pictures one a|bove another, which have on each &s;ide of them Pillars, and Angels, and &s;ome Images of Saints; much of the carv'd Work was gilded with Gold. It look'd all together extremely beautiful, and reaches to the top of the Church, which is of a good Height. The lowe&s;t piece of Painting, and the large&s;t, is a repre&s;entation of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour's A&s;cen&s;ion, the Figures in it are very curiou&s;ly drawn: The Hi&s;tory of the &s;econd, I could not under&s;tand. The uppermo&s;t Picture was but too plainly and evi|dently, their common impious repre&s;entation of the adorable Trinity. At the top of all, to crown the bu&s;ine&s;s, is, in the Stone-work, a Marble Image of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> &s;itting with a Crown on her Head, and a Child in her Lap. We were entertain'd here with an excellent Con&s;ort of Mu&s;ick well compos'd, and excellently perform'd for almo&s;t an hour, then the Prie&s;t at the Altar got up from his Knees, which I believe by this time did &s;ome Penance, and gravely took down his Wafer, and while the Boys and Congregation were all &s;inging, he concluded the Show as he had begun it. In the Street, by the entrance of
<PB N="323" REF="178"> their Chappel, there hung up in very large Frames, many Copies of Ver&s;es which they had made their Scholars make in prai&s;e of the Holy Sacrament; one Frame contain'd tho&s;e in Latin, another tho&s;e in Greek; on the o|ther &s;ide of the Street were two more, which, I &s;uppo&s;e, might be &s;ome of the modern Lan|guages, or in the vulgar Tongue. Each Frame contain'd &s;ome &s;cores of Copies, but the Co|pies were &s;et in rows, and the joyning of one Paper to another was cover'd with a &s;lip of gilt Leather. The crowd and hurry was &s;o great, that we could not then read them, and the next day they were gone. The School which the Je&s;uits have here, is oppo&s;ite to their Chappel and College, in the &s;ame Street; it is a great Building, and &s;tands on three &s;ides of a large Square, which has a high Wall to inclo&s;e it from the Street. In the middle of this Square &s;tands an Obelisk with the Vir|gin <HI>Mary</HI> at the top of it; about the Pede&s;tal are many ful&s;om Motto's, among others, this, <HI>Maria flos florum;</HI> to an&s;wer which, there were Pots of Flowers &s;et at the four Cor|ners of the Pede&s;tals. The Attributes and Honours here given to the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> do not well an&s;wer the In&s;cription upon the Arch over the Gate of this Court, where they have &s;et in Latin that Text of Scripture, a little alter'd, <HI>Come ye Children, hearken unto me, and I will teach you the fear of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>The Chief Church of this City, and the Cathedral, they call the <HI>Dome:</HI> It is dedicated <NOTE PLACE="marg">D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">me.</NOTE> to St. <HI>Peter:</HI> It appears a very Noble and Mag|nificent De&s;ign, tho' it is not yet fini&s;h'd, nor have they been at Work upon it for &s;e|veral
<PB N="324" REF="179"> Years. The Quire end is quite fini&s;h'd; the Body of the Church has its Walls and Pil|lars, I think, rais'd to the height intended, but the Arches over the Pillars are not yet made; there is a Roof of Timber laid over this part for the pre&s;ent. The Steeple, I believe, is not above half fini&s;h'd, we went up to the top of it to take a view of the City, and &s;aw in it two or three very large Bells; from the top, going round, we could &s;ee the whole City and the Country about it; only, when we look'd towards the Quire, the height of that &s;ome|what confin'd our Pro&s;pect upon the City.</P>
<P>Over the High Altar, in the Quire, one &s;ees through a Lettice twelve Images &s;tanding &s;ix and &s;ix on each &s;ide of a Crucifix. They are, I believe, about two Feet long, and are &s;aid to be of Silver gilt with Gold; they are made to repre&s;ent the twelve Apo&s;tles. The Cro&s;s in the middle is gilt al&s;o, but the Body upon it is Silver ungilt: The Crucifix is &s;omewhat taller than the Images. The Altar is, I think; dedicated to St. <HI>Engelbert:</HI> There lies at full <NOTE PLACE="marg">St. Engel|bert.</NOTE> length over the Images of the Apo&s;tles, an I|mage of a Bi&s;hop carv'd in white Marble which is de&s;ign'd to repre&s;ent St. <HI>Engelbert.</HI> It is &s;aid of him, he was an Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Colen,</HI> who was murder'd by <HI>Frederick</HI> Count of <HI>I&s;&s;enburg,</HI> and his own Uncle, for defending the Liberties of his Church, about the Year 1225. He is recommended by the Legend as having fa&s;ted in honour of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> con&s;tantly on every <HI>Wedne&s;day:</HI> Certainly a great Commendation, and an In&s;tance of &s;in|gular Chri&s;tian, or rather Marian Piety.</P>
<PB N="325" REF="179">
<P>The Body of the Church has very few Al|tars in it, and they are I think only at the upper End; there are two at the Entrance of the Quire from thence; that on the left hand, as one &s;tands towards it, is an Altar to Mother <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mother</HI> Anna.</NOTE> <HI>Anna,</HI> as the Papi&s;ts call the Mother of the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin. Over it there is for an Altar-Piece a carv'd Work of white Marble not very big, where are &s;een two Women; one of them holds a Child in her lap; another, with a Cover over her head, &s;omewhat like that the Nuns throw over them as a &s;hort Veil, puts an Apple or an Orange into the Child's hand, which he &s;eems much pleas'd with. Under the&s;e things is blindly and with much abbre|viation written in the Marble, this following Stanza, one word of which I could not po&s;&s;ibly make out, but &s;uppo&s;e it might be <HI>Paris.</HI></P>

<PB N="326" REF="180"> could not remember; there is written at the top of the Work about it, <HI>Sacro &s;anctae &amp; in|dividuae Trinitati;</HI> at the bottom are the&s;e words, <HI>Domini no&s;tri Je&s;u Chri&s;ti humanitati.</HI> This expre&s;&s;es the Dedication of the Altar. They may indeed as well erect an Altar to the human Nature of our Saviour di&s;tinctly and &s;eperately con&s;ider'd from his divine Nature, as to any of the Saints; but certainly, this is a divine Honour which is not due, and ought not to be paid to any Creature; and tho' the Per&s;on of our Saviour might be, and was ju&s;t|ly ador'd while he was on Earth, becau&s;e he is God as well as Man, yet 'tis to be believ'd no one did di&s;tinctly wor&s;hip his human Na|ture, &s;o as that he might have expre&s;s'd what he did in &s;uch words as the&s;e, <HI>Je&s;u I adore thee as God for thy divine Nature, and I adore thee as Man too, or I give divine Honour to thy hu|man Nature;</HI> which is the true and evident meaning of this In&s;cription. Here were hang|ing up about this Crucifix many Hands, Arms, Hearts, and little Images in Wax-work, which were the Memorials of Favours obtain'd at this Altar as the poor People under&s;tood.</P>
<P>Not far from hence, and as on that &s;ide, one enters the Pa&s;&s;age which goes round the <NOTE PLACE="marg">An Image of the ble&s;|&s;ed Virgin.</NOTE> Quire, is &s;et up at the Corner again&s;t a Pillar an Image of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> I think, with|out any Altar at her feet.

<PB N="327" REF="180"> Silk lac'd with Silver, was very large downwards. How fitly this repre&s;ents the mean Condition, and the Mode&s;ty and Contempt of the World, and Humility of that ble&s;&s;ed Virgin whom the Son of God cho&s;e to take his human Nature of, is ea&s;ie enough to judge. This Image we &s;aw was mightily re&s;orted to, while we waited for the Opportunity to &s;ee the three Kings. Many People came directly hither when they were entred the Church, and here fell down and perform'd their Devotions, &s;ome longer, &s;ome &s;horter, and then went out at the next Door or &s;taid to be pre&s;ent at &s;ome Ma&s;s This I|mage was honour'd with at lea&s;t a dozen Wax Candles which were all this while burning be|fore it, and &s;eem'd &s;et to burn out at once. It was honour'd too with many Offerings, for many Hands, Arms, Legs, Heads, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in Wax|work hung about it. And one poor Creature had been &s;o far tran&s;ported in Super&s;tition and Folly, as to pre&s;ent a Heart here; there was hanging at the Girdle of the Image a piece of Silver as broad as the Palm of a Man's Hand rai&s;ed, and &s;haped in the form of a Heart. This is a folly frequently &s;een in the Roman Churches, and &s;ignifies without doubt the de|voting of a Heart to the Virgin, which is Ido|latry, if ever there was &s;uch a thing in the World. I find in Scripture it is the Dire|ction of the Son of God under the Name of Wi&s;dom, <HI>My Son, give me thy Heart;</HI> and it is &s;aid, <HI>Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart and with all thy Soul,</HI> &amp;c. But no where is it &s;aid, we ought to dedicate our Hearts to the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> or that we may do this. And if Covetou&s;ne&s;s be call'd Idola|try,

<P>We were waiting, as I &s;aid, to &s;ee the famous Relicks of the Three Kings; they are &s;hown, I <NOTE PLACE="marg">Three Kings.</NOTE> think, but once a day, and that not half an hour at a time. About nine a Clock in the Morning, we catch'd the Opportunity. They pretend to have here the Bodies of tho&s;e Per&s;ons who were led by a Star to our Saviour at <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> when he was newly born; whom our Tran&s;lation calls, Wi&s;e Men of the <HI>Ea&s;t;</HI> and the Papi&s;ts Kings; they make their Number to be three, and have invented Names for them, which are, <HI>Ga&s;par, Melchior,</HI> and <HI>Baltha&s;ar;</HI> &s;ome give them other Names, and it appears from the Di&s;putes about the matter, that they are all invented. It is &s;aid the&s;e Bodies were tran&s;ported from <HI>Con&s;tan|tinople</HI> to <HI>Milan,</HI> and from <HI>Milan</HI> to <HI>Colen.</HI> The &s;ame Bodies are pretended to be &s;ome|where el&s;e, but that is a &s;mall matter: If the whole Body of our Saviour from Head to Foot, as it hung upon the Cro&s;s, can be in a thou&s;and places all of it at once, 'tis no great bu&s;ine&s;s for the Body of each of the&s;e Kings to be in two places at a time, and that altho' they &s;hould be at the di&s;tance of many hun|dred Miles from one another: But if they had had this Faculty when they were alive, they might have gone abroad and &s;taid at home at the &s;ame time; they might have go|vern'd their Subjects in <HI>Arabia,</HI> and have a|dor'd our Saviour at <HI>Bethlehem</HI> all under one;
<PB N="329" REF="181"> they might have taken a long Journey, and notwith&s;tanding that, have taken their Ea&s;e at the &s;ame time in their own Palaces. They lie here in a little Chappel which is behind the great Altar, and are &s;een in the Pa&s;&s;age there. There is within the little Chappel, a Partition made with Iron-Bars, and clos'd at the top; this leaves but very little room for the Prie&s;ts to go to the Altar of the three Kings behind it. Within this Partition is a &s;ort of Tomb, which almo&s;t fills that, &s;o that two Per&s;ons can hardly go brea&s;t round it. One Prie&s;t is at the Altar mumbling &s;ome De|votions to the three Kings, while another is within that Partition, with his Surplice on, making the Show. He opens two Lattices on the out-&s;ide of the Partition next the I&s;le, and another Lattice at the Tomb it &s;elf; and there &s;tand two little Wax-Candles burning, &s;o as to ca&s;t a little light upon the Relicks: One &s;ees only what &s;eems the Crowns of the Heads of three Men, or the tops of three Skulls, for the things look of the colour of Skulls. No Per|&s;ons was &s;uffer'd to come within where the Prie&s;t was, or to touch and feel what the&s;e things were: But many People about us had the Super&s;tition to give the Prie&s;ts things to be touch'd by the&s;e &s;acred Noddles, which he took and held to them with a pair of Silver Pincers. We &s;aw hanging up here|about, by a Form to kneel and pray at, &s;e|veral of the Litanies of the three Kings, as they are call'd. And for the encouragement of &s;aying the&s;e, &s;ome days of Indulgence are granted to tho&s;e that &s;hall &s;ay them in any place; but to tho&s;e who will come and recite
<PB N="330" REF="182"> them here, more days of Indulgence are gran|ted; accordingly, there were &s;everal People a good while upon their Knees before the Show began, who &s;eem'd to be very bu&s;ie a me|riting the&s;e Indulgencies; &s;ome of the Cha|noines, before they went into the Quire, came and kneel'd down, and &s;aid &s;ome Pray|ers here.</P>
<P>We &s;aw &s;everal fine Churches with Altars, rich and neatly adorn'd, and tir'd our &s;elves well with going about; we perceiv'd they abound in Relicks, every Church affecting to have &s;omething or other which is counted valuable of this kind: I lamented that many of the In&s;criptions which expre&s;s this matter were in High-Dutch, and &s;o I could but &s;eldom make any thing of them; and to have found a Per&s;on at every Church that could and would give us an account of things in Latin, would have taken up more time than we had to &s;pend here. Be&s;ides, it is not at all ma|terial to know what Relicks they have, but only this would have been worth taking no|tice of; namely, to ob&s;erve what Veneration is to be paid to them, and what the encou|ragement is that allures the People to it. And we mu&s;t content our &s;elves with a Specimen only of this matter, in what has been &s;aid of the three Kings, and the Indulgence gran|ted to tho&s;e who &s;hall come to their Tomb, and in what I &s;hall further relate concerning the Minorites here.</P>
<P>The Minorites have here a very large and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Minorites.</NOTE> fine Church, as they are generally a good thri|ving Company of People. At the Ea&s;t-end of the North I&s;le there is a Chappel and Altar, de|dicated
<PB N="331" REF="182"> to the Infants of <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> who were kill'd when <HI>Herod</HI> &s;ought to murder our Sa|viour. The Piece of Painting over the high Altar, repre&s;ents that Tragical Hi&s;tory. Un|der that, between it and the Table, there lies along, carv'd in Stone, an Image of a Child, as laid a&s;leep. Before the enclo&s;ure of this Chap|pel, there is a Paper hung up in a Frame, which in words of Latin intimates, That in the Year 1300 and &s;omewhat more, the Body of one of the Infants at <HI>Bethlehem</HI> was &s;ent <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Infant of</HI> Bethle|hem.</NOTE> from the Minorites at <HI>Venice,</HI> to tho&s;e at <HI>Colen,</HI> and that it was confirm'd and approv'd for true, by the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Colen:</HI> And forty days Indulgence is granted to tho&s;e, who being &s;o and &s;o qualified, &s;hall vi&s;it this Chappel, and <HI>honour here with their Offerings</HI> the holy Infant. This is hone&s;tly &s;poke out, and &s;hows us for what it is that Relicks are pretended to, and &s;o much coveted and valued; it is for a pretence of Indulgences to tho&s;e who &s;hall vi|&s;it them, and they are granted for the &s;ake of Offerings; for 'tis always under&s;tood, even when 'tis not expre&s;s'd, that no Man obtains any Indulgence by being pre&s;ent at a Ma&s;s at any Altar or Chappel whatever, unle&s;s he drops there his Offering great or &s;mall, and which mu&s;t be given according to his ability. Again&s;t a Pillar, on the other &s;ide of this Church, is a Picture of a Man at full length, which is pretended to be a true Picture of St. <HI>Francis,</HI> and drawn as I remember from the Life; it has a pale meagre look, which per|haps he could not help, but it is melancholy and peevi&s;h too, which is a Fault in one that is pretended to be a mighty Saint; to their

<P>VVHEN we came to <HI>Colen,</HI> we proje|cted to have gone down the <HI>Rhine</HI> by Water; but upon enquiry, they told us, That at pre&s;ent no Boats went downwards; The rea&s;on of which was, that the <HI>Rhine</HI> was &s;o &s;well'd with the great Rains, and had &s;o overflow'd the Neighbouring Country, that they could not well find the Cour&s;e of the Channel, and if any high Wind &s;hould ri&s;e, it would be very dangerous. This put us, who could not &s;tay, upon a nece&s;&s;ity of Tra|velling by Land all the way down this River from hence. Our Pa&s;&s;age upon this account was more chargeable, and, I doubt not, more tedious too; for this very &s;wift River, would, I believe, have carried us much fa&s;ter than we went by Land, at our &s;low rate of Tra|velling. We were re&s;olv'd, however, to &s;ee the chief Cities downwards from hence which &s;tand upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and by our Land-travel had the better Opportunity of &s;eeing what the Country is all the way.</P>

The Grand-father of the pre&s;ent reign|ing Prince, who was <HI>Wolfgang William,</HI> Duke of <HI>Neubourg,</HI> was the fir&s;t of the Family that came hither.

The pre&s;ent reigning Prince, is <HI>John-William-Jo&s;eph-Ignatius,</HI> born in <HI>April</HI> 1658, of the &s;econd Wife of his Father: She was a Daughter of the Family of <HI>He&s;&s;e-Darm&s;tat,</HI> a Prote&s;tant before her Marriage, but &s;oon after turn'd Papi&s;t, in compliance with her Hu&s;|band.

We were no further in it then to &s;ee their Ele|ctoral Highne&s;&s;es at Dinner. For this we went up a Pair of Stairs at the end of a Piazza which runs along on one &s;ide of a Court. At the top of the&s;e we were in a Gallery which goes all along over it. About the middle, I think, of that we went into the Guard-Cham|ber. There &s;tood Yeomen of the Guard, cloath'd much like tho&s;e which one &s;ees atten|ding our King at the <HI>Hague,</HI> and as richly cloath'd as they at lea&s;t. Then we came into an Antichamber, where a Set of Mu&s;icians had been playing, during the Fir&s;t Cour&s;e, but had now done. Here &s;tood the Sideboard-Table, it was a pretty large one, but was ve|ry meanly furni&s;h'd for a Prince, and one that loves Pomp and Show; but I doubt no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> at &s;ometimes it is better.

There was an Italian &s;inging when we went in, but the Room was hung, and &s;poilt the Mu&s;ick of his Voice, which was, too, but weak and &s;mall. We &s;tood at the Door of the Room where they din'd. There were, I believe, Eighteen or Twenty Pages who waited at the Table, be|&s;ides a Gentleman at each of their Highne&s;&s;es Chairs. The Pages were very fine, but in an old fa&s;hion'd Dre&s;s, I &s;uppo&s;e, though it was new to us. They had a Garment clo&s;e to their Bodies, and clo&s;e to their Arms; it came down with deep and broad Skirts, Four in all, a little below the Wa&s;te. Their Breeches were turn'd in at the middle of their Thighs, and &s;ate upon them, as tho&s;e of our Rope-Dan|cers in <HI>England,</HI> but from thence downwards the Cloath came clo&s;e to them, below their Knees, like the Spani&s;h Breeches. At the bot|tom of that Pur&s;e, and of the lower part too, they were be&s;et thick with &s;hort Knots of good broad Scarlet Ribbon. Their Cloath is Scar|let, it is well laid with Silver Lace. I had al|mo&s;t forgot that they had narrow hanging Sleves behind, which reach'd from their Shoul|ders to their Hams, the Cloath of the&s;e was almo&s;t hid with the Silver Lace They were fine in this Dre&s;s, and it became them well enough. They are young Men, but &s;everal of them of an extraordinary Size. I think I never &s;ee any Man at his full Growth taller then &s;ome of them, who had but Boys Faces. The Second Cour&s;e was upon the Table when
<PB N="343" REF="188"> we came up. After &s;ome time the Gentle|men took it off, and the Pages brought it into the Room where we were, and other Waiters took it of them, and carried it down. I be|live there might be about Twelve or Sixteen Di&s;hes, great and &s;mall. Then a De&s;&s;ert was &s;et on, in which was a great quantity of Sweet|meats. There were Three very large Pyra|mids in Di&s;hes, and many Plates, and little Sal|vers; the Table was well cover'd with the&s;e. At the &s;ide of the Table, oppo&s;ite to their Highne&s;&s;es, &s;tood a Carver, with Spoons and Forks by him. He &s;erv'd them of all things, with what they de&s;ired. In the Room where they din'd, and in the Anti-chamber, there was a very great Candle&s;tick hanging, with &s;everal Branches and Sockets for Candles.

<P>In the Afternoon, the Electour and Ele|ctoure&s;s in one Coach, attended by People in about half a Dozen Coaches more, went out, I &s;uppo&s;e, to take the Air.

They had broad Shoulder-Belts, which were cover'd, I know not which is fitte&s;t to be &s;aid, with Scarlet Cloth, or Silver Lace, but if ei|ther of the Two appear'd mo&s;t, I think it was the Lace, which is of a good breadth, laid very thick, and with a Point in the middle of the Belt, it lay in the form of a <HI>Gheveron</HI> in a Coat of Arms. There were about a Dozen Trumpets, and Two Kettle Drums, the Cloth of their Coats was almo&s;t hid with the broad Silver Lace laid upon it. The Cloathing of the Kettle-Drums, as I remember, is Cloth of Silver, a deep Fringe of Gold and Silver went round the Drum at the top, and a le&s;&s;er one round about the edge of the Cloathing I never &s;aw any thing of the kind &s;o fine as the&s;e all were.

It &s;tood a|gain&s;t the Wall, upon a flat of Boards, rai&s;ed a little Step above the Stone Floor of the Church, and which goes out at a good di&s;tance from the Table. Over this Communion-Ta|ble, or Altar, is a good Picture, which repre|&s;ents our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour in his Agony in the Garden, with an Angel come to encourage him. There are Three of the Apo&s;tles a&s;leep, not far from him, and at a di&s;tance, the tops of the Torches of tho&s;e who are coming to apprehend him, appear from behind a Hill. The Hi&s;tory is well repre&s;ented. Behind the Picture of our Saviour are black Clouds, well drawn, and amid&s;t them appears a bright round thing, which looks almo&s;t as if they de|&s;ign'd to repre&s;ent the Sun, veil'd with the&s;e Clouds; but it being a Night Piece, it mu&s;t be under&s;tood, as it is intended, to repre&s;ent the Wafer which they give and receive in celebra|ting the Sacrament of the Lord's-Supper, for they admini&s;ter the Bread in that Form. O|ver this great Piece of Painting is another le&s;&s;er one, which repre&s;ents our Saviour, with a Glo|ry about him, as ri&s;ing from the dead, and treading upon a Dragon; to &s;ignifie, that he had now overcome Death, and him that had the Power of Death, as the Scripture &s;peaks, that is the Devil. This is a fit Repre&s;entation of our Saviour, but it is an impudent Bla&s;phe|my to attribute this to the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> as the Papi&s;ts do in Pictures and Images of her, with
<PB N="348" REF="191"> which I have often &s;een a Snake or Dragon put under her Feet as dead. The Pillars on each &s;ide of the&s;e Pictures were wreath'd, their Chappiters hand&s;omely carv'd, all the Work is very neat and decent, but the matter is not Marble, but Wood painted, in Imitation of Marble, &s;ome of black, and &s;ome of white Marble, &s;treak'd, and it is very well done. The Altar, or Communion-Table, was cover'd with a large Velvet Cloth, which reach'd to the Ground, of a deep blew Colour. Before the Wor&s;hip began I had time to &s;ee what Books lay at the Reading Desk; and at the Desks of the People. The Reader had before him a great <HI>Folio</HI> Bible in High Dutch, and another Book in <HI>Folio,</HI> which had for its General Title, <HI>Spiritual Songs.</HI> I look'd into it, and ob&s;erv'd there the Book of <HI>P&s;alms,</HI> and other of the Scripture Songs or P&s;alms; and al&s;o &s;ome de|vout Hymns, compo&s;ed by <HI>Luther,</HI> and other pious Prote&s;tants of their Communion. There were, I think, in one part of the Book, Forms of Prayer.</P>
<P>The Wor&s;hip here began about Eight a Clock in the Morning, and ended at Eleven. It was begun by a Reader, a grave ancient Man, who is the School-Ma&s;ter of the Prote|&s;tants Children. He fir&s;t read a &s;hort Prayer; then he read &s;everal Chapters of the Old and New Te&s;tament, while the Congregation came together. When a good Number were a&s;&s;em|bled, they began to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ing, with the Organ, their P&s;alms, and Hymns, and Spiritual Songs. I ob&s;erv'd many People, both Men and Wo|men, fell in with the &s;inging, without u&s;ing their Books which they had before them very
<PB N="349" REF="191"> often; and the Children, who &s;ate together, very readily found what was to be &s;ung, though I &s;aw it was taken out of &s;everal di&s;tant Places of their Books; which &s;hows that they were all very well acquainted with their Liturgy. I perceiv'd, that in one place they &s;ung the Apo|&s;tle's Creed; for a Per&s;on by whom I &s;ate, and who very civilly turn'd to, and &s;how'd me e|very thing that they &s;ung; at length pointed to what I under&s;tood to be that. This &s;inging took up the greate&s;t part of the time of their A&s;&s;embly. They all &s;ung with mo&s;t perfect Concord, and Agreement with their Organ, which was very plea&s;ant; and, which was more plea&s;ant, they did it with greate&s;t Seriou&s;ne&s;s and Devotion. I never &s;aw in any Quire of Monks or Prie&s;ts in the Roman Church, that they &s;ung their Devotions with &s;o much Solem|nity and Ab&s;traction, as they &s;peak, as the Peo|ple generally here did. As &s;oon as they were entred in their &s;inging, they appear'd as if the whole Soul was engag'd, and elevated above the vain World, as if they were all Thought and Devotion. I confe&s;s it tran&s;ported me with Plea&s;ure to &s;ee how fitly they &s;ung the Prai&s;es of the Great and Good Being. I thought my &s;elf in Circum&s;tances that were a a plea&s;ant Emblem and Re&s;emblance of Hea|ven; and ble&s;&s;ed my &s;elf, to find that I was now amid&s;t the pure Prai&s;es, and true Wor|&s;hippers of God. And I conceiv'd &s;uch a Di&s;dain and Dete&s;tation of the Wor&s;hip of the Papi&s;ts, where one &s;ees divine Honours paid to poor Creatures at the be&s;t, and &s;ome of them perhaps mi&s;erable Sinners in Hell, that I could hardly per&s;wade my &s;elf after this
<PB N="350" REF="192"> to look into any more of their Churches. This &s;inging was twice interrupted for a little &s;pace, at which times the Mini&s;ter went from his Pew by the Pulpit, and &s;tood before the Communion-Table, with his Face towards the People, and read fir&s;t the Go&s;pel, and the &s;e|cond time the Epi&s;tle for the Day. After they had &s;pent a good while in this plea&s;ant part of Wor&s;hip, they cea&s;ed, and the Mini&s;ter a&s;cen|ded the Pulpit, where he pray'd and preach'd. His Preaching was, as he told me afterwards, an Explication of the Go&s;pel for the Day. He perform'd his part with a great deal of Gravi|ty and Seriou&s;ne&s;s, and with a very natural unaffected Zeal, which &s;eem'd to demon&s;trate him &s;incerely &s;en&s;ible of what he &s;aid. When he concluded, the People &s;ung again for a while, and then they were di&s;mi&s;s'd with a Ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon I had &s;ome Conver&s;ation with this Mini&s;ter, in which he appear'd a very pious and good Man, and a judicious well|&s;tudied Divine, as I found afterwards. He has the Reputation of a good Scholar among the Prote&s;tant Divines. He was mightily pleasd to &s;ee a Prie&s;t of the Church of <HI>England</HI> in his Church, and in his Hou&s;e, and expre&s;s'd a great Veneration and E&s;teem for our Church He ask'd &s;everal important Que&s;tions concer|ning it, and rejoyc'd at every thing I could tell him which look'd well, and in favour of it. He po&s;itively condemn'd tho&s;e of our Nation, who &s;eparate &s;o needle&s;sly from a Church &s;o wi&s;ely and ju&s;tly reform'd, but he &s;poke this with a Spirit of Compa&s;&s;ion and Tenderne&s;s becoming a Chri&s;tian; and he di&s;cover'd, that
<PB N="351" REF="192"> he heartily lamented it, as a thing of migh|ty Prejudice to the Progre&s;s and Pro&s;perity of the Reformation. He told me they had many things wanting in their A&s;&s;embly here, for want of Means, which are u&s;ual among the Prote&s;tants, in other Places where they have more Encouragement. He had indeed a good Congregation, and many People appear'd there of good Fa&s;hion. I ob&s;erv'd &s;ome of the Electour's Guards there, in their Livery, both of the Hor&s;e and Foot, who are <HI>Lutherans.</HI> But it cannot be &s;o well with them as it &s;hould be, under a Prince that inherits &s;omething of a Bigottry for the ab&s;urd and mon&s;trous Religi|on he profe&s;&s;es. This Mini&s;ter told me, that there are Five and twenty Congregations of Prote&s;tants in this Dutchy, be&s;ides <HI>Calvini&s;ts.</HI> Some of which, I think, enjoy a &s;ettled Re|venue for the Maintenance of the Mini&s;ter, and publick Charges, but the mo&s;t of them &s;upply both the&s;e from their own immediate Contributions. He told me, the Churches of the <HI>Ausburg</HI> Confe&s;&s;ion have not all one Form of Liturgy every where exactly the &s;ame, nor all the &s;ame Modes or Methods of admini|&s;tring the Divine Offices, but in &s;everal Coun|tries they have their &s;everal Forms and Rites, yet they do not cen&s;ure, or quarrel, or &s;eparate from one another upon this &s;core, but he that is u&s;ed to Methods of one &s;ort in one Country, when he comes into another joins with the Congregations, and conforms to the Methods there with the Spirit of Meekne&s;s, and Chari|ty, and Wi&s;dom; which was in the Primitive Chri&s;tians, and directed them to demean them|&s;elves in like manner, in the like Ca&s;es.</P>

<P>ON the &s;econd of <HI>June</HI> we hired Places in a Charrette which was bound for <HI>Arn|hem,</HI> a Journey of Three Days from hence; they would carry us to <HI>Emmerick,</HI> and leave us there, for our De&s;ign was to go by <HI>Cleves</HI> Home. This was the only Pa&s;&s;age we could obtain for that Day. We paid, each Per&s;on, for it Three Guilders Ten Stivers. We were Six Per&s;ons in the Charrette, and had but Two Hor&s;es, and the &s;ame Hor&s;es were to go through the whole Three Days Journey.</P>
<P>Our Company happen'd to be all of the Reformed Religion, as they call the <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> in the&s;e Countries. They were glad when we told them we were Prote&s;tants, and we were very agreeable Company to each other. Some of them went with us quite to <HI>Emmerick,</HI> and were bound further. They were of this Coun|try, Natives and Inhabitants of the Dutchy of <HI>Mons.</HI> I asked them how they were u&s;ed under the Popi&s;h Government here They &s;hook their Heads, and &s;ighed, and &s;ignified that it is but very hardly; and intimated as much as amounted almo&s;t to Oppre&s;&s;ion. I &s;aid their Prince &s;eem'd in his Per&s;on to be good and gentle, and to have no appearance of Fiercene&s;s in his Nature; they acknow|ledg'd that, but &s;aid his Confe&s;&s;our is a Je|&s;uite, and by him and his Bretheren, who ma|nage this Prince too much, he is often in&s;tiga|ted to do things which lie very hard and unea&s;ie upon the Prote&s;tants. The Truth is, tho&s;e
<PB N="353" REF="193"> good Men, the Je&s;uites, are every where zeal|ous to extirpate the Reformation: And while the Bi&s;hops and &s;ecular Clergy of the Roman Church, unle&s;s it be a few who are link'd to them; apply them&s;elves to the more humane and gentle Methods of per&s;wading and endea|vouring to convert, as they call it, by &s;often|ing, repre&s;enting, and expounding the Do|ctrines and Practices of their Church; The&s;e, like true Politicks of the World endeavour and contrive nothing el&s;e but to oppre&s;s and de&s;troy us. Their Bu&s;ine&s;s indeed is not to gain our Souls, but our Goods and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|ons: And to kill, and take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, is their Means and their End. A glaring Proof of this they have to &s;hew particularly in the large Territories, as we may call them, which they have long po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, of ruin'd Prote&s;tants in <HI>Bohemia.</HI> Where ever they can manage a Power that is able to do Mi&s;chief, they have procur'd the Exerci&s;e of the mo&s;t Barbarous and Inhumane Cruelties again&s;t us that ever were. This <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Hungary,</HI> of late Times, have wofully felt; where Streams of Innocent Blood are crying aloud for the Ven|geance of Heaven upon them, and their Exe|cutioners. And <HI>England</HI> was lately de&s;ign'd to have been a horrid Scene of the &s;ame Tra|gick Barbarities; but, Heaven be prais'd, they were, for the pre&s;ent, di&s;appointed, by the timely Removal of the Tools which they had form'd and prepar'd for the Enterprize.</P>
<P>The &s;ame People told me they came from a Place call'd <HI>Medman,</HI> within this Dutchy, <NOTE PLACE="marg">M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">man.</NOTE> and within a few Leagues of <HI>Du&s;&s;eldorp.</HI>
<PB N="354" REF="194"> There, they &s;aid, they had lately celebrated the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, which they do four times in a Year: At which times People come from &s;everal Parts thither, for this purpo&s;e, and make up a Congregation of 1700 Communicants. They, poor People, are perhaps excu&s;able from their Circum&s;tan|&s;tances for the not u&s;ing that Ordinance more frequently. But certainly where the Magi&s;trate is of their Per&s;wa&s;ion, and they might cele|brate it as often as they will, it is a thing with|out excu&s;e to put it off only to four times in a Year. The&s;e People them&s;elves told me, that the mo&s;t of the Prote&s;tant Congregations, even in tho&s;e Parts, do celebrate this Sacra|ment every Lord's Day. I cannot chu&s;e but think therefore, that the Church of <HI>England</HI> is <HI>reform'd according to the Model of the be&s;t reform'd Churches beyond the Seas,</HI> which has provided, and perhaps order'd, that this Sacrament be celebrated every Lord's Day. But the Rule and Precept of Holy Scripture, together, and in conjunction, with the Practice and Exam|ple of tho&s;e very Per&s;ons, by whom the Spirit of God tran&s;mitted the Rule to the World, is certainly rather to be ob&s;erv'd, than the Or|ders of any later Church; and our Rule in the ca&s;e is certainly mo&s;t agreeable with Holy Scriptures. I mo&s;t heartily wi&s;h our People would, more generally than they do, fall in with &s;o Ju&s;t, and Pious, and Edifying an Or|der. We ought indeed to relinqui&s;h and purge out more entirely from among&s;t us this Relick of Popery; for it was the Papi&s;ts who fir&s;t in|troduc'd, and betray'd the People into the
<PB N="355" REF="194"> &s;eldom Receiving of this Sacrament, not|with&s;tanding that they now reproach us with it. They have taught the World, in&s;tead of receiving, to reverence it mightily fir&s;t, and then by degrees to adore it. Certainly 'tis an Error, and a great one, to have &s;uch an Awe and Reverence for the Sacrament it &s;elf, as to have none at all for the Ordinance or In&s;ti|tution of it, which requires it to be receiv'd. And it is doubtle&s;s a wrong and &s;uper&s;titious Fear, to be afraid of receiving it unworthily, and not be afraid of neglecting and omitting to receive it as often as we might have Op|portunity to do &s;o.</P>
<P>Our Road from <HI>Du&s;&s;eldorp</HI> was not on the Bank of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> but out of the Sight of it. We pa&s;s'd through a rich Corn Country, and our Ways were tolerably good. When we came within about two Hours of <HI>Duysberg,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Wood of</HI> Duysberg.</NOTE> which was to be about the middle of this Day's Journey, we entred a va&s;t Wood or Fore&s;t. It was very plea&s;ant to us, and look'd almo&s;t every where like a Grove, there being very little under-wood within our Sight, and it was generally dry and firm under us. It is full of &s;tately tall Trees, the mo&s;t of them Beech or Oak, and they very fair and flou|ri&s;hing. There was on it a good Coat of Green, which afforded Pa&s;ture for Sheep; and we &s;aw in our way three or four very large Flocks of Sheep of a good &s;ize, they look'd in a very good Condition, and were each Flock attended with two or three Shep|herds, and &s;o many &s;tout Dogs; and be&s;ides they kept near together. This Wood is &s;aid
<PB N="356" REF="195"> to have a great many wild Bea&s;ts in it, of &s;e|veral &s;orts, and to have be&s;ides many Hun|dreds of Hor&s;es that run wild in it, who chu&s;e a hungry Liberty, e&s;pecially in Winter, rather than a fat and well fed Servitude. There were Juniper Bu&s;hes &s;catter'd about every where through this Wood in great abundance. We were about an Hour and half in pa&s;&s;ing through it, at a good rate of travelling, and found it thick &s;et with Trees all the way; and when we came on the other &s;ide of it, where we look'd upon <HI>Duysburg,</HI> we ob&s;erv'd that it &s;urrounded the City at the di&s;tance of two or three Miles, and went both ways be|yond our Sight, though we could &s;ee it a great way.</P>

<PB N="359" REF="196"> There is a &s;mall Univer&s;ity in this City, of the Reform'd Religion, for the Studies of Phi|lo&s;ophy, and Divinity.

This is a &s;ort of men|ding, ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the Wetne&s;s and Rottenne&s;s of the Ground here. We jolted over the&s;e Trees for I believe near half a Mile together.

There was a large Brook running through the Town with &s;ome Force and Noi&s;e; over it lay a wretched wooden Bridge, which &s;eem'd broad enough for Carts to go upon, but too rotten to bear them. We went over it with &s;ome Care and Fear' The Water of this was of a lovely
<PB N="362" REF="197"> Che&s;nut Colour, which &s;hows from what &s;ort of Ground it is deriv'd. Yet from a Well in the Town I got tolerable good Water to drink. I reckon indeed that the Town it &s;elf &s;tands upon firm Ground, but at the edge of a Tract of mar&s;hy Ground, and it is on that &s;ide of the moori&s;h Ground which is towards the <HI>Rhine.</HI> It is not, I believe, far from that River, and, I &s;uppo&s;e, the Ground between them to be more firm and pa&s;&s;able. I believe the Occa&s;ion and Original of the Town to have been at fir&s;t a Roman Fort, which is a u&s;ual thing in all the Countries conquer'd by that brave People. For there remains here a very remarkable Building, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Raman Building.</NOTE> concerning which I could learn nothing, but that it was built by them about the time of our Saviour's Nativity. It is a large and high Tower, built perfectly round. It &s;tands, with the Building adjoined, in a Place a little eleva|ted from the re&s;t of the Town. It is at one Corner of a large &s;quare Court, about which is a great Brick Building, like the common Seats of the Barons of the&s;e Countries, which are commonly call'd Ca&s;tles. Several of which we met with in our Journey, and after the Mo|del of &s;ome of our old Mannours in <HI>England;</HI> and the whole is encompa&s;s'd by a broad deep Moat, which was almo&s;t big enough to have &s;erv'd for a Town Ditch. We may &s;ay it is deep, becau&s;e it was of a great dep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters"> From the top to the Water that was in it The Founda|tion of this Tower, down to the Water, and &s;omewhat above Ground, was made of great &s;quare Free-Stone; above this, all the Build|ing is Brick. I do not remember that I &s;aw
<PB N="262" REF="198"> any where in the Wall, on the out&s;ide of the Court, any Places to let in Light, or from whence any could look out. It is built very high, but in Three Parts. The lowe&s;t part goes up, of an equal bigne&s;s, to about the height of Three or Four good Stories; round the top of that there &s;eem'd to be a Battlement. The &s;econd part, above this, is &s;omewhat le&s;s than this lower one, and &s;tands as within it a lit|tle. That al&s;o, like the fir&s;t, goes up all of a bigne&s;s, and &s;eems as tall as the lower, and to have a Battlement at the top. The third, and highe&s;t part, is &s;et a little within the &s;econd, &s;eems not &s;o tall as the other, and has Battle|ments at the top. The whole Building &s;eem'd compleat and &s;ound, and had no appearance of any ruine or decay about it. The Building about the Court look'd decay'd. We purpo&s;ed, it being now almo&s;t dark, to come the next Morning and examine it a little further; but our Foreman hurried us away very early, and &s;o di&s;appointed us. From the Circum&s;tances of the Place, I judge this mu&s;t have been a Watch-Tower, or a &s;ort of Ca&s;tle to view and command here a con&s;iderable Pa&s;s between it and the <HI>Rhine.</HI></P>
<P>We left this wretched Place betimes in the Morning, on the 3d. <HI>June,</HI> and pa&s;s'd on for <HI>Emmerick.</HI> The fir&s;t part of our Journey, for about an Hour and a half, was over a va&s;t wet moori&s;h Common; there were &s;ome Cat|tle feeding in it, here and there, up to the mid-leg in Water, and it &s;eem'd, that the Pla|ces where the Water &s;tood &s;o, were the be&s;t for them, for the&s;e look'd the greene&s;t.

It remain'd, with &s;e|veral other Cities, in the Dutchy of <HI>Cleve,</HI> in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the States, as a Pawn for Money lent the Electour of <HI>Brandenburg</HI> in that War.

<P>This is certainly a very ancient City, and was perhaps fir&s;t built and inhabited by the Ro|mans, who gave it the Name it has from its Situation. 'Tis very probable it might begin with a Ca&s;tle, or Fort, as many Cities have done, and the Tradition of the Place is, that a Ca&s;tle was built here by <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar.</HI> The City is call'd <HI>Cleve</HI> by the French, and <HI>Cleef</HI> by the Inhabitants, and both the&s;e Names are evidently deriv'd from the Latin Words, <HI>Cli|vis,</HI> or <HI>Clivia,</HI> which &s;ignifie the &s;teep &s;ide of a Hill, and &s;uch there is great deal of here. The pre&s;ent Ca&s;tle, which they &s;ay is upon the Place where that of <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> was built, and where they pretend to &s;how &s;ome Remain|ders of his Building, &s;tands ju&s;t upon the Brink of a deep Precipice. From thence the Hill de&s;cends more gradually, another way, to a little River which runs by the City, and falls into the <HI>Rhine,</HI> not far below it, and car|ries good large Boats for Goods or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;&s;engers, to and from the <HI>Rhine.</HI> On this gradual de|&s;cent of the lowe&s;t Hill, and partly up the &s;ide
<PB N="370" REF="202"> of another above it, the City is built. It is but a &s;mall City, but is well peopled, being a very plea&s;ant and healthy Situation; and though it is not the bigge&s;t, it is neverthele&s;s the chief City of the Province It gives the Name to the whole Dutchy of <HI>Cleef,</HI> and has been the u&s;ual Seat and Re&s;idence of the Sovereign of this and &s;ome Neighbouring Provinces. It is encompa&s;s'd with a Wall, but it &s;eems that it cannot well be made defen&s;ible, by Rea&s;on of the Hill that lies over it. It &s;tands very airy, and has its Streets of a good breadth. Our Lodging was in a hand&s;ome Street, near the Reform'd or <HI>Calvin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">t</HI> Church. This is a lofty and large Brick Building. We did not go into it, having &s;een enough of the manner of tho&s;e Churches in <HI>Holland,</HI> and we were not told of any thing worth our Ob&s;ervation there. But from our Lodging our way in a&s;cending towards the Ca&s;tle, was through a large Stone Building, which &s;tands acro&s;s that Street, which they call the middle Port. This is pretended to have been built by <HI>Eumenius Rhetor,</HI> who was the Roman Governour over the Gauls here. This is &s;aid by an In&s;cription on the upper &s;ide of the Gate, but there is no Date added to expre&s;s the time of this. Over the In&s;crip|tion &s;tands, carv'd in the Stone the Effigies of this <HI>Eumenius.</HI> His Habit is clo&s;e to his Body, down to his Wa&s;te; from thence it hangs loo&s;e, in Folds, to his Feet. The Sleeves of it are al&s;o clo&s;e to his Arms, and reach to his Wri&s;ts. He has a Ferula in his Left Hand, which was a Symbol of Authority, and in his Right
<PB N="371" REF="202"> Hand he holds up a little Di&s;h, which &s;eems heap'd full with Pieces of Gold.</P>
<P>From hence we &s;till a&s;cended very con&s;ide|rably to the Ca&s;tle. This is a very large Build|ing, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ca&s;tle of</HI> Cleve.</NOTE> and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a great deal of Ground. We were told, it contains, of all &s;orts, at lea&s;t Three hundred and fifty Rooms. We &s;aw the be&s;t of them, which did not amount to twenty. The Audience-Chamber, the Dining-Room, the Bed-Chamber belonging to the Electour, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d &s;everal others. The fine&s;t Rooms which they &s;how'd us, they call'd our King's Cham|bers; the&s;e were his Bed-Chamber, and his Audience-Chamber. The outward Curtains of the Bed were blew Velvet, the inward were white Satin, curiou&s;ly embroider'd with Silk, with a Cover-lid, and the top of the Bed of the &s;ame. Here were the livelie&s;t and the be&s;t Tape&s;try Hangings that I ever &s;aw. One Piece repre&s;ented a Winter, where one &s;ees a Gentleman driving his Mi&s;tre&s;s in a Traino, and others skateing upon the Ice. In another there is a Fea&s;t; in another a Land&s;chape, with Shepherds and Shepherde&s;&s;es, making merry by their Flocks. All the Figures on the&s;e were &s;o lively, and &s;o well &s;haded and proportion'd, that it does not &s;eem ea&s;ie to ex|cel them in a Picture. The next Room to this is his Maje&s;ty's Audience-Chamber, which is hung with excellent Tape&s;try too. The State is Scarlet Velvet; the Seams where the &s;everal Breadths of the Velvet are join'd, are cover'd with a broad Gold Galoone. The Fringe round the Canopy, con&s;i&s;ted of a multitude of little Knots of Gold Thread, tied up in a great
<PB N="372" REF="203"> Number of Bows. The Curtains, over the Doors, were of the &s;ame Velvet, with a Gold Galoon, and &s;uch Knots round at the Edge of them. In the&s;e, and the other be&s;t Rooms of the Ca&s;tle, we were divided between the Fine|ry of the Furniture within, and the Beauty of the Pro&s;pects out at the Windows. Below are Gardens belonging to the Ca&s;tle, and beyond them one looks either towards the Hill above the City, which is planted with Trees, that &s;tand in Rows up to the top, from the View of the Ca&s;tle, or el&s;e one &s;ees a great length of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> with the Country about it. From the&s;e Chambers we de&s;cended a little; and went through a long Gallery, and at length, under a wide Arch, we went down &s;ome Steps into a great Hall. This Arch is of Marble, of &s;eve|ral Colours, and the &s;everal Ranges of it &s;e|verally wrought. It &s;eems to be old Work, but intelligent People &s;ay, it is not &s;o old as is pretended. For this was &s;hown us as a Relick of the old Building of <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar.</HI> On one &s;ide of it there &s;tands a little Image, in a Niche, much defaced, which &s;eems to be ju&s;t of the &s;ame Figure with that on the Gate fore|mention'd, and, I believe, was made for the &s;ame <HI>Eumenius;</HI> but the People told us, this is the Effigies of <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> him&s;elf, and over it, accordingly, there is this In&s;cription in the Wall:
:

It were too long a Task to mention every thing particular|larly that is entertaining here, but I mu&s;t not omit the fine&s;t Pro&s;pect perhaps in the World, which they have from the top of the Hill, a|bove the City, which they call <HI>Sterrenberg.</HI> We <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sterren|be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">g.</NOTE> mount about half a Mile above the City to the top of this.

Among the Trees planted here, there are left Thirteen Alleys, which run &s;trait down the Hill, and meet all in the Center at the top. From thence the&s;e Alleys point and direct the view to &s;ome con&s;iderable Place in the Country round about. And one &s;ees all the beautiful Country round, as far as the Eye can reach with a di&s;tinct View, from <HI>Nimmeguen</HI> down|wards, to <HI>We&s;el</HI> upwards, with all the Valley upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> the Cities and Villages in that,
<PB N="374" REF="204"> and upon the Hills which bound the Sight on the other &s;ide. A finer Country cannot be &s;een, and the Pro&s;pect is as much as the Eye can reach; &s;o that if any where in the World an Exception could be found to <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Maxim, it is here, that the Eye mu&s;t be &s;atisfied with &s;eeing.

It was all done with a Pen, and is no bigger then might be cover'd with a little Hand. That which &s;eem'd mo&s;t curious in it, is a &s;mall Writing in High Dutch Language, but in Latin Letters, &s;o curiou&s;ly laid about it, that &s;ome very artificially makes the Folds of

<P>The Urns are mo&s;t of them &s;omewhat bro|ken, <NOTE PLACE="marg">&V;rns.</NOTE> and appear to have been but thin Pots, they are all Earthen ones, and of &s;everal Shapes, &s;ome long and &s;lender, &s;ome &s;hort and broad, in Proportion.

When they fell into the Cu&s;tom of Burning their Dead Bodies, they perform'd it after the following Manner. When the Dead Body had been for &s;even whole days together wa&s;h'd, anointed, and call'd to, by the neare&s;t of Kin, at length, with &s;olemn Pomp, it was carried out to the Burning. The Pile of Wood was built in Form of an Altar, and &s;weet-&s;melling Woods were mingled a|mong others, that the Smell of the Body in Burning might not offend the Company. The Dead Body was laid upon the Pile with the Face upwards, a Piece of Money was put into the Mouth to pay <HI>Charon,</HI> the &s;uppo&s;ed Ferry-man of the <HI>Stygian Lake,</HI> who was to conduct his Soul over that to the <HI>Ely&s;ian Fields,</HI> or Place of Bli&s;s. And they thought the Soul
<PB N="381" REF="207"> &s;till remain'd with the Body, even after Death, till the Body was di&s;&s;olv'd. When they had done this, the neare&s;t of Kin took a lighted Torch, and, with the Face turn'd away, &s;et Fire to the Pile; &s;ometimes precious Liquors, as rich Wines, or perfum'd Oils, were thrown upon the Fire as it was burning, and &s;ometimes rich Cloaths, and Gold, or Silver, were thrown into the Flames when any Great Per&s;on was burn'd, and the Cu&s;tom grew to an Exce&s;s, which the Government thought fit to re&s;train by a Law. While the Fire la&s;ted, &s;ome of their Slaves were kill'd, or Captives taken in War, at the burning of a Commander; or el&s;e hir'd Gladiatours fought and blooded one the other, as a Sacrifice and Attonement to the Infernal Gods. When the Wood was all con|&s;um'd and the Body, the &s;ame Per&s;on that lighted the Pile gathered up the A&s;hes of the Body which remain'd, and any bits of Bones that were not burnt; and, having fir&s;t wa&s;h'd them with Milk and Wine, put them into the&s;e Urns. After which, this Per&s;on and the re&s;t of the Company were three times &s;prinkled by the Prie&s;t with clean Water: The Per&s;on that lighted the Fire, gave the Word, that the A&s;&s;em|bly might depart, and they, in departing, pro|nounced mournfully and aloud, the Word <HI>Farewel,</HI> to which they commonly added this, moreover, <HI>In the Order which Nature permits we &s;hall follow thee.</HI> The Urn, with the A&s;hes in it, was buried, and an Altar was erected by the Place of Burial.</P>

And therefore a lit|tle above <HI>Nimmeguen,</HI> it divides it &s;elf, and makes from thence Two great Rivers; One Chanel which runs by <HI>Arnhem,</HI> is &s;till call'd the <HI>Rhine,</HI> but this which comes by <HI>Nimme|guen,</HI> is call'd the <HI>Wael.</HI> It is very broad and deep, and carries large Ve&s;&s;els. This Divi|&s;ion is made at a Point of that Land which is call'd the <HI>Betuwe,</HI> which is a Word deriv'd from the Latin, <HI>Batavia,</HI> and &s;hows this to be the Country which the Romans call'd by that Name. At that Point of Land is a large and regular Fortification, call'd <HI>Schencken&s;cans:</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Schenc|ken&s;cans.</NOTE> This belongs to the States-General, and lies &s;o as it Commands both the&s;e Channels of the <HI>Rhine. Nimmeguen</HI> is &s;ituated on the left Bank of the <HI>Wael.</HI> It is a large City, the Area of it &s;omething more then half a Circle: It is en|compa&s;s'd with a good Wall and a Ditch, and fortified with a convenient number of Ba&s;ti|ons. It &s;tands upon a Ground which ri&s;es con&s;iderably from the River, but very gradu|ally: But at that &s;ide which is uppermo&s;t upon the River, the Ground &s;tands very high, and
<PB N="389" REF="211"> comes a &s;teep Cliff to the Water. Upon that Place is built a large and &s;trong Ca&s;tle, which commands the River upwards and down|wards, and &s;ome of the adjacent Country. This Ca&s;tle they pretend was built by <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> or rather re&s;tor'd and improv'd by him. The Streets of this City are generally broad and airy, they are &s;trait, and &s;ome of them very long. It &s;eems to be a very &s;weet and healthy Place to live in, and to have a good Trade. They brew here a &s;oft Small Beer, which is in great Repute all over the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> under the Name of <HI>Nimmegue&s;ce Mol.</HI> It becomes pretty clear even while it <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mol.</NOTE> remains &s;oft, whereas their other &s;orts of Peer are commonly very thick, while they are &s;oft, and by that time they are a little fin'd, they grow hard: But this Drink is too, a crude and very flatulent Drink, it is whole&s;ome&s;t to drink it mingled with a little da&s;h of French White Wine, or Rheni&s;h, and then it becomes very Diuretick.</P>
<P>We went to &s;ee <HI>Domini Smetius,</HI> one of the <HI>Calvini&s;t</HI> Mini&s;ter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">, of the City, for the &s;ake of his&punc; Collection of Rarities, which con&s;i&s;ts, I perceiv'd, chiefly in Medals and Coins, of which he &s;ays, he has of all &s;orts, about Ten Thou&s;and.

<P>The great Church of the Town is a &s;tately and magnificent Building. It is dedicated to St. <HI>Stephen</HI> the Protomartyr. It was formerly a Collegiate Church. 'Tis now po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, and u&s;ed by the <HI>Calvini&s;ts,</HI> which is the Religion of the Magi&s;trates here, as in all the Domini|ons of the States General.

<HEAD>Pa&s;&s;age from <HI>Nimmeguen</HI> to <HI>Rotterdam.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE next Day we took the Ship which went for <HI>Rotterdam</HI> at Eight a Clock in the Morning. It was very full of Pa&s;&s;engers. We paid for each Per&s;on one Guilder two Sti|vers for our Pa&s;&s;age; and at going off they &s;pung'd &s;omething of us for our Portmantle, and for the Ship Servants. We could not be in the Roof, the mo&s;t commodious Room in the Ship, becau&s;e there was one of the Magi&s;trates of <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> with &s;ome of his Family in it, and though they did not fill it, yet they would po&s;&s;e&s;s it all; and when we found every Body el&s;e gave way to his Wor&s;hip, with the Defe|rence due to a Petty Prince, we were forced to do &s;o too, and &s;tow'd our &s;elves but inconveniently in the Skipper's Kitchin. For it was a Day of exce&s;&s;ive Rain, and forced us to be under cover. We paid four times Pa&s;&s;age Money between this and <HI>Dort.</HI> At <HI>Nimmeguen</HI> a Stiver for each Per&s;on; at <HI>Tiel</HI> a Stiver and half; at <HI>Bommel</HI> two Stivers; at <HI>Gorcum</HI> two Stivers, and an O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">tie, that is a quarter of a Stiver. We were forced, at each of the three la&s;t mention'd Places, to &s;top till an Officer came on board us to gather this, and this &s;tay lo&s;t us u&s;ually almo&s;t an Hour. We had a Gale of Wind, but it was directly again&s;t us, at North We&s;t. This made our Way long, by Rea&s;on of the fre|quent Tacks it forced us to make. Towards Night it fail'd us, and we could advance no
<PB N="392" REF="213"> fa&s;ter, than as the Stream drove us, yet we got down before Ten a Clock at Night to <HI>Dort.</HI> The Tide gave us little or no Hindrance, becau&s;e at this time it did not come up &s;o far as u&s;ually, e&s;pecially with a We&s;terly Wind, by Rea&s;on of the great Force of the River, which was exceedingly &s;well'd with the great Rains, and Land-Floods. In a dry Sea&s;on, with &s;uch a Wind, we were told the Tide will mount to <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">rcum,</HI> or beyond, whereas now it came not &s;o high. On this Occa&s;ion I &s;hall take notice of what I have ob&s;erv'd and learnt concerning the lowne&s;s of this Province of <HI>Holland.</HI> The Rain and Snow which falls in the Winter-time, lies upon their Ground, and covers all their Meadows all over the Country with Water, &s;o that the whole Country looks like a Sea, and no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">y Ground appears, but here and there, where a Village or a City &s;tands a little above the Water, and where there are high rai&s;ed Banks, which they call Dykes, to go upon between them. This Water mu&s;t in Spring-time be all thrown out of the Mea|dows by Mills. The&s;e throw it into the great Canals, which are the u&s;ual Pa&s;&s;ages about the Country. The&s;e Canals communicate with the Rivers by Sluces, which are open'd at a low Tide, and then the Water which they are fill'd with from the Meadows, will &s;ome of it fall off. But if there be at the time of dreining a we&s;terly Wind, e&s;pecially a &s;trong one. It keeps the Waters of the Rivers &s;o high, that the Canals will not empty them&s;elves in|to the Rivers at all, or but very little, at the lowe&s;t of the Tide. For this Rea&s;on, when
<PB N="393" REF="213"> there is a we&s;terly Wind, the Mills are bound to ob&s;erve a Water Mark. And when the Canal which they throw the Water into is ri&s;en to that Mark, they mu&s;t &s;top, and and work no more till it is &s;unk below it again. But if there be a good ea&s;terly Wind, that drives the Waters of the Rivers &s;o much out, that the Mills are not bound to ob&s;erve their Mark, becau&s;e every fall of the Tide will let out Water enough to empty the Canals &s;uffici|ently; but at &s;uch a time I have &s;een the Ca|nals Brim full, by that time the Tide would give leave to open the Sluces, and let the Wa|ter out.</P>
<P>Somewhat above <HI>Gorcum,</HI> on our Left Hand, as we come downwards, we &s;ee the famous Ca&s;tle of <HI>Loven&s;tein.</HI> It is a very &s;olitary Place, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Loven|&s;tein.</NOTE> and has no other Building <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ear it. It &s;tands on a &s;mall point of Land, between two great Rivers. This Ca&s;tle is the Place where the States confine any con&s;iderable Per&s;ons who are condemn'd to be Pri&s;oners for Life. At this narrow point of Land the <HI>Mae&s;e</HI> comes into the Chanel, call'd the <HI>Wael;</HI> and from this Place the united Streams were anciently call'd the <HI>Merwe,</HI> down to <HI>Ulaarding,</HI> which is below <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> and almo&s;t at the Sea; but now the Name of the <HI>Mae&s;e</HI> prevails in com|mon U&s;e.</P>
<P>When we were near <HI>Gorcum,</HI> we took no|tice of that large Track of Ground which &s;uffer'd by an Inundation the la&s;t Winter, in <NOTE PLACE="marg">Innunda|tions.</NOTE> fro&s;ty Weather, in which &s;ome People and many Cattle were drown'd. The Water of the <HI>Mae&s;e</HI> being &s;well'd by a Bank of Ice which
<PB N="394" REF="214"> clogg'd the River, it run over the Dyke on the right &s;ide, a little above <HI>Gorcum,</HI> at two Places, and run over a great Compa&s;s of the Coun|try within, for with running over the Dyke it wore it away. It was &s;ome time before the Mi&s;chief could be cured by clearing the Cha|nel of the River, and a dangerous Work to go about it; but the City of <HI>Gorcum</HI> were ne|ce&s;&s;itated to adventure the Danger of it, to &s;ave them&s;elves from the Inundation which would &s;oon have been at lea&s;t in all their lower Rooms. The Occa&s;ion of the &s;topping of the broken Ice, at this Place, &s;eems to have been an I&s;land which lies here in the middle of the River, a good &s;pot of which appear'd above the Water cover'd with Gra&s;s, notwith|&s;tanding that, at this time, the River was ex|treamly &s;well'd. The Breaches of the Dyke &s;till remain'd when we came by, which was at the beginning of <HI>June,</HI> and the Water ap|pear'd to lie all over the Country; &s;o that of Nece&s;&s;ity the Ground mu&s;t be lo&s;t for this Year, and I cannot tell whether or no it will ever be recover'd.</P>
<P>A little below this, a great deal was lo&s;t, long &s;ince, by an Innundation near <HI>Dort,</HI> which is not recover'd to this Day. When we came near <HI>Dort,</HI> between &s;everal little Plats of Ground which have nothing on them but Gra&s;s, we &s;aw on the Left Hand of us that broad Water call'd <HI>Den Bies Bos,</HI> which is all of it an old Inundation, which happen'd in the Year 1421, at a time, I &s;uppo&s;e, of a great Land-Flood meeting with a Spring-tide, and that drove in from the Sea, perhaps, with
<PB N="395" REF="214"> a high we&s;terly Wind; which things concur|ring, are very dangerous to the&s;e Countries. The <HI>Wael</HI> and the <HI>Mae&s;e</HI> &s;well'd to that degree, that they broke in upon this Country, between <HI>Brabant</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> and drowned Seventy Populous Villages, and in them more than an Hundred thou&s;and Per&s;ons. The Tradition of the Country &s;ays, there was no Per&s;on &s;av'd, but a Child in a Cradle, with a Cat; and that the Cat help'd to &s;ave the Child, by flying from one &s;ide to the other of the Cradle, as the Waves threatned to overturn it. Up|on one of tho&s;e Plats of Ground, foremen|tion'd, there &s;tands a piece of a tall Brick Wall, the Remains of a great Hou&s;e which formerly &s;tood there. Some of the Lands ad|joining to <HI>Dort</HI> have been &s;ince recover'd, but far the greate&s;t part remain &s;till under Water.</P>
<P>We reach'd but to <HI>Dort</HI> this Day, but we came time enough to get in, and lodg'd in the City. At &s;ix a Clock next Morning we &s;et Sail again; it was almo&s;t a Calm. The breath of Wind that did move, was again&s;t us. We advanced &s;o &s;lowly, that we fear'd we &s;hould make a Day of this Pa&s;&s;age; therefore, as o|thers did, we went into a Boat, with Oars, which call'd on purpo&s;e at ours, and at other Ships, for &s;uch Pa&s;&s;engers as were in ha&s;t. We gave them &s;ix Stivers each Per&s;on for our Pa&s;&s;age, were about an Hour and half in their Boat, and got to <HI>Rotterdam</HI> by ten a Clock, &s;ome Hours before our Ship could arrive; &s;o I had by that time di&s;patc'd &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s I had to do, and was ready to return to the <HI>Hague</HI> the &s;ame Day. We were very thank|ful
<PB N="396" REF="215"> to Almighty God, as we had Rea&s;on, for the favourable A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Protection of his Good Providence, through this Journey; which was &s;uch, that we were never &s;o much as in fear of being robb'd, or abus'd by Thieves, in a Journey of &s;everal Hundred Miles. And though we &s;ometimes apprehen|ded &s;everal other Dangers, yet we e&s;cap'd them all, without &s;uffering any unlucky Acci|dent.</P>
