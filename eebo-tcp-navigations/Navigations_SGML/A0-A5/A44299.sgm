<P>SEeing (mo&s;t Ingenious Reader) that Hi&s;tories of this Nature have not only been approved as plea&s;ant, but profitable, in &s;tirring up the Minds of <HI>Men</HI> (e&s;pecially of the younger &s;ort) to the Study of Ingenuity, and a De&s;ire of performing, and being capable of un|dertaking &s;uch Enterprizes as upon &s;undry Emergencies may re|dound to their Advantage; I could think of no better way or method, than to mingle <HI>Seriou&s;ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Mirth, Ingenious Stratagems</HI> and <HI>Policy,</HI> with <HI>War-like Exploits,</HI> and <HI>&s;ucce&s;sful Undertakings,</HI> in <HI>Love</HI> or <HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s;</HI> or what can be rea&s;onably imagined, that may the better &s;uit with every Capacity.

<P>The Introduction; together with the Beginning of Renowned <HI>Hawkwood</HI>'s Love to fair <HI>Dorinda;</HI> And the Re&s;olution he took thereon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHen as <HI>England</HI> (after the Conque&s;t) began to flouri&s;h in Trade and Manufacture, (enriched by the Indu&s;try of its Inhabitants, by traffiquing, as well abroad as at home, among&s;t tho&s;e that contributed to its Promotion of this kind) the <HI>Merchant-Tay|lors,</HI> then called <HI>Linnen-Armourers,</HI> were <HI>Eminent</HI> not only in Peace, but War; as amply appears by their <HI>many Noble Exploits,</HI> in Honour and Defence of their Coun|try. And &s;ince they have been memorable on &s;undry occa&s;ions, I &s;hall, to obliterate that wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ch is objected again&s;t them, touching their Manhood, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> deliver (as I find them in their particulars and generals) a candid Relation as to matters of Love, Bu&s;ine&s;s, Witty Intreagues, and War-like Exploits, performed by &s;undry Wor|thies of this Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;&s;ion, which have rai&s;ed them a La&s;ting Memory. And &s;ince <HI>Love</HI> is one principal Thread, whereby Hi&s;tories of this kind are fa&s;tened to the affe|ctions and good liking of the Reader, I think it altogether convenient to proceed regularly, and in order, that nothing may be omitted which is capable of adding a due Lu&s;tre, or rendering the Vndertaking plea&s;ant and delightful; the Proof of which take as followeth:</P>
<P>Among&s;t other Youths who&s;e di&s;cretions prompted them to undertake this Pro|fe&s;&s;ion, was one <HI>John Hawkwood,</HI> of Parentage but mean, yet of a goodly Per&s;o|nage, a quick App<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ehen&s;ion, and &s;ound Iudgment, which afterward rai&s;ed him to a con&s;iderable Degree and Advancement in the Record of never-dying Fame.</P>
<P>This Youth having undertaken the Profe&s;&s;ion of a <HI>Taylor,</HI> and by his neatne&s;s, activity, and dextetious performance, &s;oon gained the Love and Applau&s;e of his Ma&s;ter, and his Cu&s;tomers, with many others, continuing to be re&s;pectful and obli|ging to all manner of People: &s;o that as he grew in Years, his Credit encrea&s;ed, and with it his Ingenuity. But now (as it often happens to Young Men in the bloom of their days) he ca&s;ting his eyes upon <HI>Dorinda</HI> his Ma&s;ter's fair Daughter, a Virgin compleat in Beauty, and worthy to be beloved; it &s;o happened, that by often feeding his fancy with the Fair Object, he became intangled in the &s;nar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s of Love, which for a while he &s;truggled with, or rather &s;eemed to &s;light, as being altogether ignorant of its Power and Force; not con&s;idering, that like Lightning, the more it is oppo&s;ed, the more Force it gathers, till breaking through the Cloudy Re&s;i&s;tance,
<PB N="2" REF="5"> it makes the greate&s;t noi&s;e; that is, The more a Lover &s;trives to &s;tifle his Flame, the hotter it burns, and torments him more than if he gave it vent. And this our Youth found in the end to be his ca&s;e, and therefore began thus to debate with him|&s;elf: <HI>Well,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>and Mu&s;t I give Love way? Mu&s;t I yield to the Flames that he has kindled, or rather kindled by the Eyes of my Beloved Mi&s;tris, who knows not (perhaps) what pain &s;he puts me to? or if &s;he did, the di&s;proportion being great, How can I with Rea&s;on expect a Cure? Tu&s;h, tu&s;h,</HI> continued the amorous Youth, <HI>Love is that which baffles Rea&s;on, and puts &s;erious Con&s;iderations to flight: A thing that takes the Diadem from Queens, and makes a Conque&s;t over Prince and Pea&s;ant: Why then &s;hou'd I di&s;pair? Although indeed I have but little ground to Hope, yet a tryal will be ea&s;ie; and it is far better to run a hazard, than to live in pain: Fortune may &s;o bring it about, that although the Fair One I admire be cour|ted by many, &s;he may (notwith&s;tanding the &s;eeming difficulty) be mine. <HI>Hellen</HI> at fir&s;t was coy, yet <HI>The&s;eus</HI> gained her love: And <HI>Paris,</HI> though a Shepherd, won her from a King. And why in this ca&s;e may not the Lot be mine, among&s;t &s;o many Blanks, as if the chance &s;eemed ea&s;ier? It is but venturing; and come the wor&s;t, I can but lo&s;e what otherwi&s;e I never mu&s;t expect.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Then ca&s;ting fear a&s;ide, I will be bold,</L>
<L>And either fix more firm, or loo&s;e my hold.</L></Q>
<P>Having &s;aid thus much, he re&s;olved to watch his opportunity, &s;o that he might find a convenient time to tell his fair Mi&s;tris how dear and tenderly he loved her, and how (without a &s;uitable Return) he mu&s;t remain unhappy. Nor was it long before he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o convenient a time; For looking out of his Chamber win|dow in the Evening, he e&s;pyed the Ioy of his Heart going abroad by her &s;elf; where|upon, unknown to any of the Servants, or indeed to any of the Family, he followed her in the be&s;t Equipage the &s;hortne&s;s of the time would permit him to furni&s;h him|&s;elf withall; and although he was a&s;&s;ured he had many Competitors, or Rivals, he re|&s;olved to know his Doom,

<P>OVr Youth re&s;olving upon what he had determined, and ob&s;erving which way the fair <HI>Dorinda</HI> went, out-&s;tripped her by a nearer path; and &s;o opportunely meet|ing, he made his low, but amorous &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, paying his re&s;pects as on that occa&s;ion was &s;uitable; when as &s;he not &s;u&s;pecting wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">t was intended, but thinking he had met her by chance, began to que&s;tion him where he had been, as al&s;o of his bu&s;ine&s;s; to which he replyed, that <HI>His only bu&s;ine&s;s was to wait upon her, and to tender his Ser|vice with all the humble and endearing Re&s;pect imaginable; and that only in her Smiles he could be happy.</HI></P>

<P>NO &s;ooner had our Ingenious Youth performed what he intended, and made his e&s;cape, but down came the Man in the Whiskers to poor <HI>Impolito,</HI> who, till he was deceived, imagined at the &s;ound of every &s;tep it was his Mi&s;tris the fair <HI>Dorinda,</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="8"> which had cau&s;ed him to draw nearer and nearer the Foot of the Stairs, thinking no le&s;s than that <HI>Hawkwood</HI> went up to inform her of his arrival; but upon the ap|proach of him I have mentioned, he imagined it might be her Father, whom he indeed had heard of, but never &s;een, and &s;o (not altogether forgetting his Duty) he fell on his Knees, and anticipated what he was about to &s;ay to him, by asking him Ble&s;&s;ing. This po&s;ture &s;o unexpectedly, and out of &s;ea&s;on, to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ether with the mention of <HI>Dorinda</HI> to marry, (of whom, it &s;eems, he asked Con&s;ent, with many prote&s;tations of his Love and Sincerity) confirmed the old Gentleman in all that <HI>Hawkwood</HI> had told him; and thereupon taking him from the ground, he began to fumble his Pul&s;es, and con&s;ider the working of his Temple-Veins, which through the vehement agitation of his pa&s;&s;ionate expre&s;&s;ions, were not in a little di&s;order: The Young&s;ter the mean while wondering what was meant by this unu&s;ual handling; yet continuing his di&s;cour&s;e of Love, with many Cringes, he began at la&s;t to enquire for his Mi&s;tris, declaring how he was &s;ent for, and to what intent he came. <HI>Well, well,</HI> &s;aid the old Gentle|man, <HI>be not too ha&s;ty Swe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">art, and I will go up and &s;end her down to you.</HI> But no &s;ooner had he left him in expectation of &s;uch an Happine&s;s, but at the ringing of a Bell, two or three lu&s;ty fellows entred at another door, and catching poor <HI>Impolito,</HI> carried him forcibly up Stairs, where clapping him into a warm Bed, provided for the purpo&s;e, they bound him down with Cords, and &s;o (whil&s;t he remained in much Con&s;ternation and Confu&s;ion, wondring what was intended) they po&s;ed him as bare as a Coot, by &s;having off his Hair; after which, the old Gentleman acco&s;ted him with his In&s;trument, and other Furniture, u&s;eful on that occa&s;ion, bleeding him on both Arms till &s;uch time as he became exceeding faint, and &s;econded that with &s;undry Applications and Medicaments; no Intreaty of his, nor Relation of what he was, or to whom he appertained, was any ways availing to prevent it; for the more he told the &s;tory of his Love, and the End of his coming thither, the more he increa&s;ed (in the opinion of tho&s;e that had to do with him) the Conception of his Di&s;temper; all his &s;erious Prote&s;tations, and earne&s;t A&s;&s;everations of what he was, and to whom he was allyed, being only taken for Ravings, and the Defects of a di&s;orderly mind; &s;o that in the end, through Phy&s;ick, unu&s;ual Dyet, and Impatiency, he was in a manner what (by mi&s;take) they had taken him for.</P>
<P>Young <HI>Impolito</HI> remaining in this plight, great was the Enquiry after him, and the rather, becau&s;e <HI>Dorinda</HI> had &s;ome hours after his departure &s;ent a Letter, much to the &s;ame effect as the former; &s;o that after three days ab&s;ence, and no intelligence of him, they began to imagine &s;trange things: The Vncle, that he was Spirited away; and <HI>Dorinda,</HI> that he &s;lighted her, either ab&s;conding or denying him&s;elf; and others had their peculiar and different Conceptions of the matter. But &s;o it hap|pened, That after a tedious &s;earch, and the exact De&s;cription of him to divers per|&s;ons in tho&s;e Parts, with promi&s;es of Rewards and Gratuities, Information was brought to <HI>Ga&s;pero</HI> in who&s;e hands he was, who coming thither, found him in a &s;trange condition, brought, by his V&s;age and Dyet, &s;o low, and &s;o much altered, that it was difficult to know him. <HI>Impolito,</HI> upon the &s;ight of his Vncle, cryed out, and made a grievous Complaint, declaring how he was trappan'd, and what mi&s;eries he had undergone, withal, producing the Letter he had received, which being compared with what <HI>Dorinda</HI> had afterward &s;ent, agreeing much in the Sub&s;tance, and more in the Hand, it was concluded to be an Artifice of hers; for that the Intreague of their loves being all along kept &s;ecret, it could not be thought that &s;uch a bu&s;ine&s;s could be contrived without her knowledge; and that on which this &s;u&s;picion was the rather grounded, was her &s;udden conde&s;cen&s;ion. And with this, and what el&s;e had
<PB N="10" REF="9"> happened, the old Woman who was Hou&s;e-keeper to <HI>Ga&s;pero,</HI> was &s;ent to acquaint her, who was indeed as yet ignorant of the particulars of what had happened; nor was &s;he a little amazed when &s;he heard them, prote&s;ting her ignorance and innocency. As for the Doctor, he begged Pardon for what he had done, pretending and alledging it was done through mi&s;take, though by him de&s;igned to a good intent; that he had been impo&s;ed upon, and was &s;orry and a&s;hamed he had been &s;o deceived and abu&s;ed: But &s;o lively de&s;cribed the Party that committed <HI>Impolito</HI> to his cu&s;tody, that he was (not long after) di&s;covered: As will appear in the following Chapter.</P>

<P>THe Lovers thus cro&s;&s;ed in their expectation, the cro&s;s accident (through many thwartings that ari&s;e) created &s;o great a mi&s;under&s;tanding between them, that by degrees they became cold to what before they &s;o hotly were intent upon; &amp; the rather, for that <HI>Impolito</HI> being much weakened, and out of order, was &s;ent into the Country to recover his Health, and &s;oon after, for the bettering his Vnder&s;tanding, into For|reign Parts, under the Protection of a Tutor: Where, for a while, we will leave him.</P>

<P>By this means, I &s;ay, <HI>Hawkwood</HI> being freed from what he before apprehended would &s;uddenly leave him no place for Hope, rejoyces like a reprieved Malefactor, that (at lea&s;t) he has gained Time, though not the utmo&s;t of his Wi&s;h, and by new Ser|vices &s;trives what he can to appear &s;omething in the Eyes of fair <HI>Dorinda,</HI> who had by this time ca&s;t off the di&s;turbance &s;he was in, and concern for what had &s;o lately happened, which required not much difficulty, &s;eeing in that Match &s;he rather &s;trove to gratifie her Ambition than Love; but &s;till he found her the &s;ame towards him: Sometimes indeed &s;he would &s;eem to give him a Smile, but then again would de&s;troy that favour with a Frown; during which time, the re&s;tle&s;s <HI>Ga&s;pero</HI> had u&s;ed his utmo&s;t diligence to find out the Author of the Intreague before mentioned, breathing nothing but Threats of Revenge; and was &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, by the De&s;cription, and other Circum&s;tances, that he pitched upon <HI>Hawkwood</HI> to be the man; and the rather, for that (at that very time) he was not only ab&s;ent from his Ma&s;ter's Hou&s;e, but was &s;een returning from that of the Doctor's: and therefore verily concluding, that it had been contrived by him and <HI>Dorinda,</HI> not &s;o much for his Nephew's di&s;grace, as his own, who had &s;o earne&s;tly laboured in the bu&s;ine&s;s: He concluded &s;ometimes on one thing, and &s;ometimes on another, to revenge the Affront: Sometimes he thought to make known what had happened to <HI>Dorinda's</HI> Father, and to demand a publick acknowledgment and &s;atisfaction: At other times he thought this low, and vow'd
<PB N="11" REF="9"> to Right the Injury by Law; but the&s;e were da&s;hed, upon the con&s;ideration of the Propo&s;als he had made to <HI>Dorinda, viz.</HI> That in ca&s;e the Marriage &s;ucceeded, all the Rents and Profits he had already received of his Nephew's E&s;tate, &s;hould re|dound to him&s;elf: and this covetous Rea&s;on was the only one, for which he was &s;o earne&s;t, in contriving and clapping up a private Match. So that waving the&s;e, he re&s;olves on a private Revenge, whereby (as he &s;uppo&s;ed) the Suffering of the one might redound either to the Grief or Shame of the other; for he verily believed, that upon <HI>Dorinda's</HI> little Concern for the breaking off the Match, that another had gain|ed her Heart; and &s;o proceeded to conjecture this might be him: Whereupon, blin|ded by Pa&s;&s;ion and Mi&s;take, he at fir&s;t re&s;olved upon a fatal way to make a Separation, which was by procuring him privately to be murthered: But again, upon &s;econd thought, weighing the dangerous con&s;equences, if it &s;hould be di&s;cover'd, he conten|ted him&s;elf to change it into an extraordinary Beating or Cutting, which might prove more la&s;ting and painful than the former: and this was his ab&s;olute determination.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>GA&s;pero</HI> having decreed as afore&s;aid, yet not daring to attempt it him&s;elf, it &s;o hapned: As he was looking out of his Window one Evening, he e&s;pyed two Ruffian-like fellows walking carele&s;ly in the &s;treet, appearing by their Garb and Motion to be de&s;titute both of Money and Imployment; in&s;omuch, that at that time it came into his Head, that the&s;e were wonderful &s;itting to execute his Revenge: Wherefore, when he had a little narrowlier ob&s;erved them, he &s;ent a little Youth he kepe to run on Errands after them, with order to invite them to his Hou&s;e. The&s;e Fellows, who would have run a Mile to a Three-penny Ordinary, upon this Invita|tion, began to wonder what it &s;hould mean, yet &s;tood not to di&s;pute the matter, but followed the Youth, as &s;uppo&s;ing to what end &s;oever it was, it could not be to their prejudice: And &s;o being brought into the Hall, the Boy went up to his Ma&s;ter, and informed him, that the Men he had &s;ent for were below, and waited his good plea|&s;ure; whereupon he ordered him to carry them into his Parlour, and &s;et before them &s;uch Meat and Drink as the Hou&s;e at that time afforded; which was done with all convenient &s;peed. This unexpected Entertainment did not a little &s;urprize them, for Now or Never they thought they had met with their good Angel, which made them &s;mile upon each other, and ask the Boy the cau&s;e, who told them, he knew no other than that it was his Ma&s;ter's good plea&s;ure. Then began they to conclude, that this was &s;ome Gentleman, of an Ancient Family, who generou&s;ly (though contrary to the fa&s;hion) kept up the Ho&s;pitality of his Ance&s;tors; and &s;o, without any further &s;cruple, fell on feeding and carrou&s;ing, not only for pre&s;ent &s;atisfaction, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ut to pay their hungry Bellies the Arrears of divers days before, wherein they had Dined at Duke <HI>Humphry</HI>'s.</P>

<P>The&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions delivered with &s;o much Bravado, made <HI>Ga&s;pero</HI> conceive he had happened on the mo&s;t worthy Champions of the World, and began to compute <HI>Guy, Bevis,</HI> and the Ancients, but Child<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">en to the&s;e; and thereupon perceiving they wan|ted convenient Weapons to mawl the Young&s;ter, who all this while was ignorant of what was intended again&s;t him, impatient of delay, he runs to his Armoury, and fetches a couple of ru&s;ty Back-&s;words, made in the days of his great Grandfather, and the&s;e he recommends as fit In&s;truments of his Indignation; but withal, com|mands them they &s;hould proceed no further than to cutting and &s;la&s;hing, or make him compound for his Life with the lo&s;s of a Limb, or the like.

<PB N="14" REF="11"> in the Evening) they loytered for him, &s;uffering him to overtake them, and then, af|ter giving him &s;ome opprobrious words, from which he gathered what they intended, and &s;hrewdly gue&s;&s;ed at the cau&s;e, and would have made &s;ome Reply, but they &s;o furi|ou&s;ly fell upon him, who had no weapon to defend him&s;elf, that they prevented it; for now he that in One Man had never met with his equal in &s;trength thought that Now or Never was the time of trying his utmo&s;t force; and therefore, without any words, having received &s;everal &s;evere Cuts, he grapled with <HI>Dareill,</HI> and violently wre&s;ting his Sword out of his hand, flung him from him again with &s;uch force, as mad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> his bones &s;hake within him; and &s;o furiou&s;ly charged upon <HI>Bragwell</HI> before the other could recover, that he not only obliged him to give back, but made the Blood run fearfully about his Ears. <HI>Dareill</HI> &s;eeing his Companion in this plight, and him&s;elf without any weapon, runs to the Stile, and pulls from thence a Bar, with which he came behind <HI>Hawkwood,</HI> and gave him &s;uch a blow e're he could turn about to receive him, as made him bend with one knee to the ground; but &s;uddenly recovering him|&s;elf, he was not long unrevenged; for being by this more and more in raged, he laid &s;o hard upon <HI>Dareill,</HI> (the other be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ng already faint for lo&s;s of blood) that he made him fall as dead at his feet; and then charging upon the other, who was &s;taggering to the relief of his Companion, inflicted on him &s;o many fre&s;h wounds, that he likewi&s;e dropped, and with a faint voice cryed out for Mercy: So that <HI>Hawkwood,</HI> by the fearful wounds he had given them, &s;uppo&s;ing they were no longer men of this World, and finding him&s;elf hurt, threw down the bloody Sword, lea&s;t by bearing it away, the matter might be di&s;covered; and bidding them beware how they ba&s;ely and ingloriou&s;ly attempted to turn <HI>A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins</HI> for the future, (tho' at the &s;ame time he verily believed they were never more capable of it) he pur&s;ued his way, pen&s;ive and thought|ful of many things, but e&s;pecially of what had befell him; and &s;oon concluded by what he had gathered (as I &s;aid) from &s;ome words they had let fall, that it hapned through <HI>Ga&s;pero</HI>'s procurement; but thinking him&s;elf &s;ufficiently revenged, he re&s;olved to conceal the matter; and &s;o coming home, and pretending wearine&s;s and indi&s;po&s;ition, he got him to Bed, having fir&s;t provided materials to dre&s;s the hurts he had received.</P>
<P>Long had not <HI>Hawkwood</HI> been in Bed, but the Servant-Maid (who came to bring him a Cawdle, and to enquire how he did) told him, That a Neighbours Boy, who had been at the Fair, had brought the &s;ad News of two mens being murthered in the Fields; and <HI>I'le warrant you,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>it has been done by &s;ome damn'd Rogues or other, for their money; and it was well</HI> Iohn, (&s;aid &s;he, looking earne&s;tly upon our Young&s;ter, for whom &s;he had no &s;mall affection) <HI>that you e&s;caped their hands, &s;ee|ing you came home &s;o late. It was &s;o,</HI> replyed he; and thereupon &s;hewing much di&s;|po&s;ition to &s;leep, (though indeed he had other matters to think on) &s;he left him.

<P>Thus the pen&s;ive <HI>Hawkwood</HI> having debated with him&s;elf, pa&s;&s;ed over the re&s;tle&s;s night till the morning dawned, when getting up, he packed up &s;uch Nece&s;&s;aries as he thought convenient; together with the money he had got by his obliging behavi|our, during his Service, that he might be gone with the fir&s;t opportunity; the which whil&s;t he was doing, he heard the People tune their di&s;cour&s;e to the bloody Dialect of Murther, and horridly exclaim again&s;t the Murtherers, de&s;iring nothing more, than that they might be taken, prote&s;ting Hanging was too good for them, and devi&s;ed a|mong&s;t them&s;elves a Thou&s;and ways to di&s;patch them, when found: <HI>Ah!</HI> &s;ays one, <HI>they were bloody-minded Villains I'le warrant ye.

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>How upon the Bruit of a Murther divers per&s;ons ha&s;ted to the Field, tho' before they came, the two Ruffians recovering, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">re got from thence; when killing by the way a Sheep, and taking out his Heart, they made <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;pero</HI> believe it was <HI>Hawk|wood</HI>'s, whom they &s;aid they had murthered: With other things, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT &s;eems, a little after <HI>Hawkwood</HI> had left <HI>Dareill</HI> and <HI>Bragwell</HI> de&s;titute (as he thought) of recovery, (for the one he imagined already dead, and the other expiring) a Youth came by, and &s;eeing them in that condition, together with the blood that co|loured the ground, affrighted at &s;o gha&s;tly a &s;ight, he fled to the Town, and reported what he had &s;een, but for &s;ome time could not gain belief, the Peo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">le telling him they might be &s;ome drunken men, who came from the Fair, fallen a&s;leep, and that having di&s;gorged their &s;tomachs, he by the imperfect light, took it for Blood; but he con&s;tant|ly affirming the contrary, and repeating their words and groans, at la&s;t &s;o far pre|vailed, that divers undertook to go with him to the place: And upon this Youth's report it was, that tho&s;e that I have mentioned grounded their di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Divers (as I &s;aid before) undertaking to go with the Youth, it &s;o happened, that when they came there, they found not the men he &s;poke of, but there was the Bar of the Stile be&s;meared with Blood, and much Blood lying on the ground; &s;o that by plain &s;ymptomes the &s;igns of Murther appearing, they concluded, that there had been &s;ome per&s;ons murther'd, and upon &s;econd thoughts, imagined they might be Thieves, and their Companions for fear of di&s;covery (after the departure of tho&s;e that killed them) had carried off the dead Bodies, and either buried them in the Fields, or hid them in &s;ome Ditch or Hedge; whereupon they made a long and fruitle&s;s &s;earch, till late in the morning: So that not returning home &s;o &s;oon as was expected, the old Women concluded upon the truth of the matter, which occa&s;ion'd the di&s;cour&s;e under <HI>Hawkwood</HI>'s W ndow, which much contributed to his departure; though in the end his Name was thereby rai&s;ed high as a Piramide; which in the &s;equel of the Hi&s;tory will appear.</P>
<P>Now &s;ome may demand what beca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e of the wounded men, and what News <HI>Ga&s;|pero</HI> received of this Adventure? To which I an&s;wer, That being come to them|&s;elves, and fearing not only a di&s;covery of the bu&s;ine&s;s, but being in equal fear for <HI>Hawkwood,</HI> or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ather more (by being on the unju&s;ter &s;ide) than he for them, they made as good a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">hift as they could to get away, were gone &s;o far before they were enquired for, that tho&s;e who came in &s;earch of them cou d not find them, and in the deplorable
<PB N="17" REF="12"> condition they were in, fell to con&s;ulting with each other, how they &s;hould &s;hew their Faces to <HI>Ga&s;pero,</HI> &s;eeing they had promi&s;ed &s;o much and performed &s;o little; and e&s;pe|cially, if he come to know of their Treatment, how they &s;hould come by their further Reward: Many ways they propo&s;ed; but at length e&s;pying Sheep grazing by the light of the Moon, in the next Field, they re&s;olved to kill one of them, and take out his Heart, which they would make <HI>Ga&s;pero</HI> believe was that of <HI>Hawkwood,</HI> whom they had killed and privately buried. But then another que&s;tion aro&s;e, how they &s;hould come off about their wounds, &s;eeing if they had been really &s;o valiant as they propo&s;ed, it could not be rea&s;onably expected, that one man could have u&s;ed them at that rate: But to &s;alve this, they likewi&s;e concluded to inform him, That having done the Ex|ploit, and coming late through many by-ways, to prevent pur&s;uit or di&s;covery, they were &s;et upon by Nine or Ten Robbers, who (from behind a Hedge) fell upon them be|fore they were aware; but as &s;oon as they faced about and charged them, they fled, &s;ome with the lo&s;s of an Arm, others mi&s;erably hacked and wounded.</P>
<P>Thus having contrived to delude the Old Man, the&s;e pretended Heroes turned their valour to the de&s;truction of a harmle&s;s Sheep, and taking out of his Body what they wanted, they ha&s;ted to <HI>Ga&s;pero</HI>'s Hou&s;e, the which (having well wa&s;hed their wounds, and put them&s;elves in the be&s;t order they could) they reached by that it was day-light; when upon their knocking at the Gate, the Boy peeping through the Wicket, and perceiving their Hair &s;tarch'd together, as it were, with blood, their Vi&s;ages pale and wan, with &s;ome Scars and Cuts upon them, their Garments rent, and many other &s;igns of di&s;order, he ran up to his Ma&s;ter, and (being an awkward Country Youth) told him, That the <HI>Red&s;hanks</HI> and <HI>Wild-Iri&s;h</HI> were at the Gate, and had brought <HI>Raw-head</HI> and <HI>Bloody-bones</HI> along with them: Such fooli&s;h Fables (by way of de&s;cription) it &s;eems his Mother had put into his Head, to bugbear him in his Infancy; and &s;o much he fancied the&s;e men to be like what he had heard, that he could not be induced to go down again to enquire their bu&s;ine&s;s, tho' they &s;till &s;tood knock|ing with much earne&s;tne&s;s, as a&s;hamed to be di&s;covered by any in the po&s;ture they were in: Nor did <HI>Ga&s;pero</HI>'s fears po&s;&s;e&s;s him (upon the relation the Boy had made) with any thing el&s;e, but that they had brought <HI>Hawkwood</HI> dead, or &s;orely wounded, along with them, to bury, or otherwi&s;e di&s;po&s;e of him in his Hou&s;e; whereupon he conclu|ded, if it was &s;o, he would neither admit them, or own that he knew them, or had &s;et them on work, for fear him&s;elf &s;hould be charged with the Murther; but going up, peeping out of the window of the Lodge, &amp; perceiving the contrary, he de&s;cended again, and opened the Gate; yet at the &s;ight of his <HI>Janizaries</HI> he was not a little amazed, and they on the other hand complained of their &s;tanding there too long, which (they &s;aid) had they been pur&s;ued, might have been a means to have di&s;covered the whole In|treague: But waving further di&s;cour&s;e, he carried them into a private Room, and fetched divers Cordials, and other refre&s;hments, to revive them, whom he found, by the faultering of their &s;peech, faint, and almo&s;t &s;pent; and after they had taken &s;eve|ral lu&s;ty &s;wigs, &s;o that their &s;pirits came (as it were) again, he began to enquire of the &s;ucce&s;s of the Enterprize: To whom <HI>Dareill</HI> replyed; As for that, or any thing el&s;e in that or the like nature, that he or his Companion undertook, he need not fear the &s;ucce&s;s; for they were not wont to make Childrens Shoes of their bu&s;ine&s;s, but to perform it through-&s;titch: <HI>As for him who lately put the Affront upon you, you may</HI> (continued he) <HI>be well a&s;&s;ured, he will never do the like again.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How <HI>Ga&s;pero</HI> packed away the Ruffians beyond the Seas; And how he was terrified with the Comical Adventure of a naked Wench, which he &s;uppo&s;ed to be <HI>Hawk|wood</HI>'s Gho&s;t; And many other plea&s;ant matters that befell on this occa&s;ion.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>BY this time the two pretended Mirmidons being pretty well recovered, and much recruited with good Dyet, <HI>Ga&s;pero</HI> was de&s;irous to be rid of their company, le&s;t by words they might let fall, the &s;uppo&s;ed Murther &s;hould come to light: But then he con&s;idered, if they were abroad, and hankered thereabout, it might be the &s;ame thing; and therefore, what to do in this ca&s;e, he found him&s;elf at a lo&s;s; but con&s;idering &s;omething mu&s;t be done, he at la&s;t came to a conclu&s;ion: That if they were &s;ent beyond the Seas, his fears would by their ab&s;ence be removed; and about this he re&s;olved to confer with them, not de&s;pairing to have it done with their own liking, for that he found their fortune was as good in one place as another; and to have it better'd by a good Sum of Money, in a di&s;tant Country, might be acceptable. Nor (as Luck would have it) did they le&s;s jump in quill; for ju&s;t as he was debating this matter with him&s;elf, they came down to him, and be&s;ought him that he would di&s;mi&s;s them, for that con&s;idering all the circum&s;tances that attended the Intreague, their long tarriance in his Hou&s;e might breed a &s;u&s;pition; and that, although they were very &s;eldome &s;een, yet one or other of the Servants might &s;catter words that mig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">t di&s;cover them; and &s;eeing they were men of Fortune, if he could &s;et them
<PB N="19" REF="13"> over Sea, &s;o that when they came there, they might have &s;omething to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on, till they had opportunity to recruit, it would do very well. This was on both hands agreed on, without any further controver&s;ie; and they making a vow never to return, unle&s;s forced to it by &s;ome extraordinary accident, he gave them (to be &s;ure that they &s;hould go) a Bill to receive Fifty <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Dollers, at <HI>Bruxelles,</HI> in one of the <HI>Flemi&s;h</HI> Provinces, and &s;omewhat to bear their Charges by the way; and &s;o packing them on board an outward-bound Ship, he bid his two Champions farewel.</P>
<P>Thus (as he &s;uppo&s;ed) being revenged, and freed from all fear of di&s;covery, he began to carre&s;s him&s;elf in his &s;ecurity; yet &s;ometimes, when he reflected on the imagined Tran&s;action, he found a damp upon his Spirits, but mo&s;tly in the night, for through multitude of bu&s;ine&s;s in the day he was diverted from it; but in the end a Comical accident fell out, that overwhelmed him with a thou&s;and fears; &amp; was in this manner:</P>
<P>It &s;o happened, that <HI>Ga&s;pero</HI> having a plea&s;ant Orchard, or Garden, belonging to his Hou&s;e, and it being in Autumn when the pregnant Earth produces the effects of her teeming labour in their full perfection; the <HI>Douvigha,</HI> or Governante, (for &s;o I may properly call the old Woman, who was his Hou&s;e-keeper) hearing her Daughter, a plump red-headed wench, was to be married to a jolly blade, a Coachman, her fel|low-Servant, &s;he &s;ent in the Evening for her, when <HI>Ga&s;pero</HI> was gone abroad; whe|ther to give her In&s;tructions, or to what other purpo&s;e, I leave to the con&s;truction of the Reader; but however, that &s;he might be more charming to her Bridegroom, &s;he admoni&s;hed her to go to the Spring in the Orchard, (or rather, for its plea&s;antne&s;s, might be termed a Fountain) and there to wa&s;h her &s;elf, directing her to un&s;trip her &s;elf, and leave her Clothes in an Arbor a little beyond it. The Wench took this for a kind of an odd Prank; but her Mother, for many weighty rea&s;ons, urging it, and &s;he being favoured by the light of the Moon, no longer di&s;puted her Commands, who promi&s;ed to watch the mean while, that no body &s;hould come in at the Garden-Gate to interrupt her, the Boy being gone out with his Ma&s;ter; and as for any other Inva&s;ions, &s;he doubted not, but the walls would &s;ecure her again&s;t them; and &s;o &s;he proceeded to do what &s;he was commanded.</P>
<P>Now it &s;o unluckily fell out, that a young fellow of the Town, having by the help of a Ladder gotten over the Wall, to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of &s;ome of the delicate Fruit that grew in the Orchard, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> was at that very Iuncture gotten upon a Tree that hung over the Spring, with its &s;preading branches laden with Fruits, rin'd with Vermi|lion and Gold; or, as the Poet has it, in Relation to the Garden of the <HI>He&s;perides:</HI>
<Q><L>With Golden Fruits the laden Boughs did bend;</L>
<L>On whom a wakeful Dragon did attend. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>Now whether the Fellow, who perceived the La&s;s approaching, had this whim in his Head, to fancy her the Dragon that kept the Orchard, I &s;ubmit it to the Iudg|ment of the Reader. But if this &s;tory be true, (as I would not have you doubt it, &s;eeing it is in Print) he lay &s;nug upon one of the branches, not only till &s;he unclad her &s;elf, but when &s;he entred timerou&s;ly by degrees, as either by rea&s;on of her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">ing a &s;tranger to the place, or fearing the depth, (being no great Arti&s;t, I &s;upp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">e, at &s;wimming on her Face) or that &s;he meant thereby not to cool all at once; but in the end growing bolder, &s;he fell (the better to make quick-work on't) to da&s;hing &s;pat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">er|ing, dabbling, and &s;crubbing her &s;elf at a &s;trange rate: When (O the danger of too much curio&s;ity!) our Young&s;ter in the Clouds reaching his Head too low, (upon what account is doubtful, tho' &s;ome may be apt to gue&s;s it was out of humility, by this time
<PB N="20" REF="14"> fancying her to be <HI>Diana</HI>) he lets go his hold, and down he drops, Apples and all; giving a da&s;h as great as <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s Logg, whom <HI>Ae&s;op</HI> tells us, was thrown to the Frogs, together with the further account he gives of it in his Fable, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This &s;udden noi&s;e not only troubled the Waters, but made the La&s;s (like a River-Nymph, with dropping Hair, di&s;orderly hanging, &s;ome on her Brea&s;ts, and &s;ome on her Shoulders) ha&s;te thence, &amp; unmindful (through &s;udden fear) of returning for her Clothes, in her native Livery of Nakedne&s;s, &s;pring out of the Fountain, and with &s;peed (not inferiour to <HI>Attalanta</HI>) ha&s;te to the Hou&s;e for &s;helter. Now, as if Mi&s;|chief had this Night &s;et all her Engines on work, the old Woman had ju&s;t let in <HI>Ga&s;pero,</HI> who (having &s;ent his Foot-Boy about further bu&s;ine&s;s) was returned alone; and had &s;carce entred the Hall-door, and about to &s;hut it, but in bur&s;t the Wench upon him, and with the violence overthrew him, where he lay crying out for help; whil&s;t our Governante (to colour the bu&s;ine&s;s the better) letting her Candle drop, (as you mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, through fear, though indeed to hide her Daughters naked|ne&s;s, till &s;he e&s;caped into &s;ome corner of the Hou&s;e, for further relief): Whil&s;t the Governante, I &s;ay, having dropped her Candle, came to his relief, and by woful ex|perience, upon enquiry, found that his Guts (by rea&s;on of the fright this Apparition put him into) were fallen very low in his Breeches; and further, that not only a deadly palene&s;s had covered his Face, but he was taken with &s;uch a fit of trembling, that his Ioints &s;eemed of no more u&s;e to &s;upport him, than if they had been made of a Quaking Pudding: Nor could &s;he in a long time (though &s;he &s;trove what in her lay) bring him to his right Wits; and when that Little Sen&s;e he had left was returned, he &s;till trembled, and with a gna&s;hing of his Teeth, and a wild kind of a Countenance, de&s;ired to be conveyed to a Cou&s;in's Hou&s;e of his, not far di&s;tant from his own; charging her withal, upon her Life, not to &s;ay any thing of what &s;he had &s;een.</P>
<P>Glad of this opportunity was our <HI>Douvignia,</HI> that &s;he might in time return to en|quire into, and calm her Daughters fears, who (poor Wench) &s;tood &s;hivering and &s;haking on the Stair-head, as not being capable of entering any of the Chambers, by rea&s;on of their being locked: Nor &s;tayed &s;he, after <HI>Ga&s;pero</HI> was &s;afely lodged in the hands of his Friends; but leaving him to make his Apology for perfuming the Hou&s;e, &s;he abruptly took her leave; and coming home, &s;truck a Light, where &s;he found the poor Girl, as afore&s;aid, who revealed to her all that happened, intreating her to fetch her Clothes, and &s;uffer her &s;peedily to depart; which &s;he accordingly did; the Fellow (before her coming) having &s;crambled out of the Water, and recovered (by the help of his Ladder) the other &s;ide of the Wall; but by leaving (for ha&s;te) his Bag of Apples behind him, that plainly demon&s;trated the purpo&s;e of his coming. This, upon her Mothers returning with the Clothes, the Daughter was informed, and &s;oon after became &s;atisfied; though at fir&s;t &s;he imagined it to be no le&s;s than the Prince of the Air turned Madg-howlet, who &s;uppo&s;ing her (at a di&s;tance) to be a Sea-pye, or young Duckling, had &s;tooped to make her his Prey. But being again clad, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, &s;he vowed, if her Husband was not contented with the white|ne&s;s of her skin, he &s;hould &s;crub it him&s;elf with his Hor&s;e-Cloth; for &s;he'd venture no more by Moon-light on that occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The old Woman having di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her Daughter with Motherly Advice, rela|ting to Marriage-af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">airs, and the Boy being by this time come to keep hou&s;e, &s;he returned to her former Charge, by the way framing an excu&s;e for her ab&s;ence; (as who doubts, but w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">m n have t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">em at their fingers ends on all occa&s;ions, e&s;pecially Gover|nants) As for he that doubts this, let me tell him by the way, it will be hardly worth

<P><HI>Ga&s;pero</HI> by this time being pretty well recovered, and having refre&s;hed him&s;elf, was per&s;waded to go home, but he would by no means hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ken to it, fancying (it &s;eems) that this naked La&s;s was no other than the Gho&s;t of <HI>Hawkwood,</HI> imagining in that con&s;ternation, that the red Hair that hung in Rats-tails, by rea&s;on of its being wet, to be the bloody Cuts and Sla&s;hes that had been given to di&s;patch him.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How <HI>Dorinda,</HI> and the whole Family, were much troubled at the &s;udden departure of <HI>Hawkwood:</HI> And how he coming to an Inn on the Road, hears the Relation and Adventure of a blind Race; undertakes to lye in a haunted Chamber, and takes the &s;uppo&s;ed Gho&s;t Pri&s;oner, and is well rewarded for his pains.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe Ma&s;ter of <HI>Hawkwood,</HI> and the whole Family, (the fair <HI>Dorinda</HI> not excep|ted) being much troubled at his &s;udden departure, &s;ent divers Me&s;&s;engers after him, but they either mi&s;&s;ing the Road he went, or being too &s;low, returned no wi&s;er than they went; and being un&s;ucce&s;sful in this, they began to gue&s;s at the rea&s;on of his going away; but though there were many Arguments, <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con,</HI> yet all came &s;hort of the true rea&s;on; but <HI>Dorinda,</HI> who indeed under&s;tood &s;ome part of it, tho &s;carcely the main bu&s;ine&s;s, yet w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">at &s;he knew, (for fear of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">lame in not &s;ooner re|vealing it) &s;he kept it to her &s;elf: But mo&s;t of all, the Maid (who hoped to gain his Love by her good Services) lamented his ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t this concern for <HI>Hawkwood</HI>'s ab&s;ence was at home, he was trudging the Road, or wandring through the unfrequented Woods, the better to avoid pur&s;uit, till at length (weary and faint) he &s;ate him down, and began to lament his misfor|tune; but mo&s;t of all, that he mu&s;t be bani&s;hed from the &s;ight of fair <HI>Dorinda; O!</HI> (&s;aid he) <HI>that this days Sun &s;ees me &s;o unhappy, to forgo all that is dear to me on Earth!</HI> But having vented his &s;orrow in &s;ighs and &s;uch-like expre&s;&s;ions, he began to be more moderate, and recollect his manly &s;pirits, to fortifie his Rea&s;on, that &s;o, whatever befell him, he might with Fortitude and Patience &s;upport him&s;elf. But having by this time travelled far, and night coming on, he bethought him&s;elf of a place to repo&s;e in; and having a plea&s;ant Town in Pro&s;pect, he ha&s;ted thither, and took up in the chief Inn, which was not large, being only a Country Village; yet not doubting of a Lodging, he &s;ate him down, and called for what the Hou&s;e afforded, and &s;o &s;tayed till much within night before he asked whether he might lye there or no; when calling his Landlady, he put the que&s;tion to her, who &s;haking her Head,
<PB N="22" REF="15"> told him, That indeed they had a &s;pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e Room, with a Bed in it, but to deal plainly with him, there had been for &s;ome nights pa&s;t a great di&s;turbance there, by the forci|bly throwing things up and down, and that &s;he could conclude no other from thence, than that it was haunted with &s;ome evil Spirit; and for that rea&s;on, &s;he being a Widow-Woman, and many times none but her &s;elf and her Maid in the Hou&s;e, was about to leave it.</P>
<P>At the &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s of this Di&s;cour&s;e, delivered withal with &s;uch earne&s;tne&s;s, <HI>Hawkwood</HI> could not choo&s;e but &s;mile; at which the Ho&s;te&s;s &s;eemed a little angry, imagining he laughed at her, as if &s;he had told him a Fable; but he bid her be paci|fied, telling her, that &s;eeing it Rained, (as indeed it did) and was a very &s;tormy night, rather than he would be de&s;titute of a Lodging, he would venture (with her leave) to take up in that Room. <HI>Nay,</HI> (&s;aid &s;he, taking him up ha&s;tily) <HI>ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e a care young-man, what you &s;ay: for I vow and prote&s;t, I would not have any Body come to any harm in my Hou&s;e for all the World; for</HI> (continued &s;he) <HI>the noi&s;e is &s;o ter|rible about Twelve of the Clock, or &s;omewhat after, that the &s;toute&s;t of our Car|riers (though you &s;ee they are great Lubbarly fellows) dare not venture into the Room; Nay, one of them did but ju&s;t put his Snout in, and had a &s;tone thrown at him, which beat him down Stairs, and &s;o mawled him, that he lay by it three days.</HI> By this <HI>Hawkwood</HI> (who was of a prompt wit) verily conceited it mu&s;t be &s;ome trick put upon the Hou&s;e; for he con&s;idered, that the Devil &s;eldome or never carries &s;tones in his Pocket, by rea&s;on he alwaies leaves his Breeches at home (if ever he wears any, as ten to one he does not); and thereupon re&s;ted the better &s;atisfied, promi&s;ing not to refu&s;e that Bed at any rate. But whil&s;t they were thus di&s;cour&s;ing, in comes a great Lubbarly fellow, laughing till his &s;ides cracked again; and being de|manded what was the occa&s;ion, could not &s;peak for proceeding in his Laughter; but in the end growing a little calmer, &s;aid, That he had been at the running of a blind Race: And when they de&s;ired him to expound his Meaning, he &s;aid, That blind <HI>Tom,</HI> a fellow well known in the Town, had laid a Wager with another that could &s;ee, to run with him a Mile; but with <HI>Provi&s;o,</HI> that him&s;elf &s;hould name the Time and Place, and the other to be ready at an houres warning, whenever the blind man &s;hould require it. <HI>Now,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>you may think this &s;omewhat &s;trange; but you &s;hall hear how it happened.

And now bed|time being come, tho' many per&s;wa&s;ions were u&s;ed by the Ho&s;te&s;s, and others, to avert him from lying in that Room, yet he u&s;ed &s;uch Arguments, that he made them re&s;t &s;atisfied, that (if he was not a Conjurer, as &s;ome of them vainly conjectured him) he was a man that had been conver&s;ant in &s;uch matters, and was not afraid of Spirits: And &s;o furni&s;hing him&s;elf with a good Battoon, and a dark Lanthorn, with a watch Candle in it, up Stairs he goes, and takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Chamber, laying him|&s;elf down on the bed in his Clothes, and &s;etting the things I have mentioned by him; whil&s;t the Ho&s;te&s;s and the re&s;t were Cro&s;&s;ing them&s;elves, and praying for his &s;ucce&s;s, the former prote&s;ting upon her hone&s;ty, that if he conjured down, or freed her Hou&s;e from the Spirit, &s;he would give him all the money in her Pur&s;e.</P>
<P>Now &s;o it happened, that about the u&s;ual hour, that is &s;omewhat after Twelve, as he was mu&s;ing on the matter, he heard &s;omething about the Window; for note, it was an upper Room, which had a Gla&s;s Ca&s;ement, which went out into a Gutter, between two ridges of Hou&s;es, and &s;o into a Neighbours Hou&s;e at a Window of the like nature. <HI>Hawkwood,</HI> as I &s;aid, &s;eeing this, re&s;olved (whatever it was) to let it enter without mole&s;tation, and thereupon lay as &s;till as a Mou&s;e in a Chee&s;e; when by and by open flew the Ca&s;ement, and in with the Heels formo&s;t comes &s;ome|thing all in whire, and began to tumble and throw the things about with a terrible noi&s;e; whereupon <HI>Hawkwood</HI> &s;oftly rearing him&s;elf up, goes with his Lanthorn in one hand, and his Cudgel in the other, and coming as near as was convenient, opens his Lanthorn, which &s;hining ju&s;t in the face of the thing, where the Shroud covered it not, he plainly perceived it to be no other than the laughing Fellow, dre&s;&s;ed up in <HI>Pimlico,</HI> as Painters fooli&s;hly Picture or fancy the &s;hadow of a Gho&s;t: At the &s;ight of the Light, the Fellow &s;tarted back; but &s;oon recovering him&s;elf, thought to out|dare <HI>Hawkwood,</HI> whom indeed (as he afterward confe&s;&s;ed) he little expected to find there, although he had heard him talk of it, but found him&s;elf mi&s;taken; for <HI>John</HI> &s;tepping up to the Beard of him, &s;aid, <HI>And have I caught ye?</HI> whereupon recoiling &s;till towards the window, with a feigned, yet lamentable voice, he &s;aid, <HI>Mortal, come not near me, whoe'er thou art, le&s;t I de&s;troy thee.

Thus, for three Months, I lived a kind of an impatient life, every day expecting my Mothers coming up, that I might have my Dyet mended, or be removed. But whil&s;t I was in this expectation, one Evening being &s;ent to a Cu&s;tomer with a pair of &s;hoes, I met a Coffin, with divers in Mourning following it, and among&s;t the re&s;t, in a doleful tone, with wringing of hands, and many other expre&s;&s;ions of &s;orrow, I heard a woman cry out, O my dear Husband! how am I &s;eparated from thee by cruel De&s;tiny! whom I &s;o much loved, who wert my Joy, my Hope, and all my Comfort in this World: Thou, alas! <HI>(conti|nued &s;he)</HI> art now going to a dark and gloomy Hou&s;e, where is no joy, no plea&s;ure, no delight; to an Hou&s;e where the &s;ound of Mu&s;ick is a &s;tranger, and where tho&s;e dwell, that neither eat nor drink. Now I being but a Novice, and hearing this de&s;cription of the place, could (at that time) fancy it to be no other than my Uncles hou&s;e; and therefore turning back again, I ha&s;ted home with all the &s;peed imaginable, and fell to knocking at the Door, as if I would have bur&s;t it in pieces; my Uncle called to know who was there, but through the fear I was in that they &s;hould arrive be|fore I could have the door open, I was incapable of reply; &s;o that continuing my

<P>At the&s;e words the old Man began to &s;mile, yet &s;carcely knew whether he ought to be angry or plea&s;ed; yet in the end attributing it to my Simplicity, he by his &s;ophi&s;try &s;oon convinced me of my mi&s;take, and by that means removed my fear.</P>

<P>Long <HI>(&s;aid he)</HI> I had not been with my Uncle of the Gentle Craft, after the &s;tory I have mentioned, but growing weary of my Trade, (and more of my u&s;age) and my Mother not coming to Town, as I expected, it &s;o happened: As one day <HI>I</HI> went abroad, and was walking the &s;treets, pen&s;ive and melancholly, I met with a dapper &s;pruce fellow, who marking my Countenance, and by that gue&s;&s;ing at the di&s;tur|bance of my mind, bearing up with me, began to enquire into my Country, Paren|tage, Bu&s;ine&s;s in Town, and finally my Name, with many more things and matters, too tedious to recite; of all which I &s;atisfied him as well as I could; but it &s;eems he knew them before as well as my &s;elf, happening in the &s;equel to be my Country-man and Neighbour. This Youth invited me to go along with him; but I, who had been terrified both by my Mother and Uncle, with the fear of being Spirited, the dread of <HI>Bugby's-hole,</HI> &s;o much wrought upon my conceit, that with &s;uch Com|plements as I had, I endeavour'd to excu&s;e his invitation, by pretending bu&s;ine&s;s, and want of lei&s;ure: When indeed it was the &s;ame with St. <HI>Cri&s;pin</HI>'s Day, the on|ly Holy-day my Uncle had allow'd me &s;ince my coming to me, and in genero&s;ity, for the &s;ake of that Saint, &s;o much admired by the Trade, had gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">en me Three-half-pence to &s;pend as I thought convenient, though withal admoni&s;hing me by the by, to lay it out in good Liquor, tipping me the wink, that that was the be&s;t way
<PB N="27" REF="17"> to employ it: Now with this mighty Sum, and &s;ome other pence I had given me by Cu&s;tomers, I was going (you mu&s;t know) to &s;ee a Country-man of mine; when in the end it happened to be the very Youth I had met as before, but &s;o altered in his Clothes and Carriage, that I knew him not, (though I had heard where he lived) till he fir&s;t di&s;covered him&s;elf to me, and then we lovingly embraced each other, and (after the asking and an&s;wering many que&s;tions) I con&s;ented to accompany him; and &s;tra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ghtway he led me to a place, where I found a great number of young Sparks in the height of merriment, who every one, upon my entrance ri&s;ing from their re&s;pective &s;eats, came and pay'd me a welcoming Complement. Now I, who knew not what all this &s;hould mean, &s;tood like an Owl among&s;t the Jackdaws, and knew not what to &s;ay for my &s;elf; but he that brought me thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">her, &s;upplyed my defect, and told them, I was an hone&s;t Country-man, though not of the &s;ame Pro|fe&s;&s;ion: Then they demanded my Calling, which I frankly told them; upon which turning their Heads on one &s;ide, not utterly to da&s;h me out of countenance, they fell to &s;n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ckering for a while, but afterward made me &s;it down, and bid me heartily wel|come; when on a &s;udden, all the Tables were &s;pread with &s;uch &s;tore of Varieties, that at the &s;ight thereof I &s;tood gaping and gazing, as if I had been in another world; but recollecting my &s;elf, and &s;eeing others fall to, I made no bones to do the like, and there fed not as the Country E&s;quire ordered his Man, for that day, or the morrow, but to &s;upply the defect of many hungry Meals pa&s;t, as never dreaming to meet with &s;uch another opportunity: Dinner ended, Wine of all &s;orts flowed about at a &s;trange rate, and then entred the Mu&s;ick.

Now it &s;o happened, when I was ju&s;t out of my time, among&s;t other young Gentlewomen (for among&s;t them lay the &s;tre&s;s of our Trade) that came under my handling, there was one of the lovelie&s;t Creatures that I fancied I had ever beheld: In her Body nothing was wanting, that might render it compleat; her Complexion was fair; her skin as white and &s;oft as the Down of Swans; the Round of her Face incli|ning near to a perfect Oval; and though her Eyes were not the greate&s;t, yet they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all that could be de&s;ired in loveline&s;s, being quick, with mildne&s;s, and full of Love, that with a &s;ingle glance they darted into my Brea&s;t all the Flames that &s;parkled in them&s;elves; her Mouth in its kind was not inferiour to her Eyes, for being very little, it &s;hut with Lips of unfading Vermilion, &s;o that in its natural frame, it pre&s;ented an Object not to be parallel'd for Beauty; and when again it opened either to laugh or &s;peak, it alwaies afforded a Thou&s;and new charms; and what has been &s;aid of her pretty Mouth, may likewi&s;e be &s;aid of her fair Hands, which by their nimblene&s;s and dexterity in the &s;malle&s;t actions, &s;eemed to embeli&s;h them&s;elves; but more might be &s;poken of the &s;overaign Beauty of her Neck and Snowy Brea&s;ts, which appeared to be the Ma&s;ter-pieces of Nature: Her &s;tature was not of the talle&s;t, but &s;uch as could not chu&s;e but plea&s;e: And as for her Gait, Ad|dre&s;s, and Pre&s;ence, they promi&s;ed &s;o much, that nothing cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d be more.

This, you may well think, was killing News to me, and for a time made me almo&s;t be&s;ide my &s;elf; for now my di&s;gui&s;e, I found, was no more available, but might rather confirm the matter; &s;ometimes I thought to revenge the Treachery; at other times, how <HI>I</HI> might relea&s;e my Mi&s;tris; and often bur&s;t out into Tears, to think that for my cau&s;e, and that for the &s;ake of Love, &s;o fair a Creature &s;hould be &s;o roughly handled, and wi&s;hed that any misfortune might have befallen me, &s;o &s;he was no partaker of it. And now my &s;tudy was to gain intelligence, in which Room &s;he was confined, re&s;olving at any hazard to &s;peak with, and comfort her in the be&s;t wi&s;e: Nor was it long e're I gained it from a little Youth, belonging to the Hou&s;e, whom I had found abroad, and tempted to the di&s;|covery with divers trifles of no great value; but &s;urveying the place at a di&s;tance, I found the acce&s;s wonderful difficult; yet, What will not Love do, where it does truly center? I getting me the Skin of a Bear, with a Head &s;o artificial, that much curio&s;ity mu&s;t be u&s;ed in di&s;tingui&s;hing it from that of a live one; and &s;o fit I framed this covering for my purpo&s;e, that when I was wrapped in it, I &s;eemed no other than the very Creature I repre&s;ented; and &s;o the &s;ucceeding night lay in Ambu&s;h, in

<P>Having thus done, we went down Stairs, and bolted the Door on the in&s;ide, and &s;o hid our &s;elves in a Nook, or behind the Geaum of the Wall, to expect the event, and weather the utmo&s;t that might befall. Now &s;o it fell out, that &s;oon after the good People coming home, and not being able with their Keys to get Entrance, mi&s;tru&s;ting &s;omewhat more than ordinary, fell to knocking and thundering at the Door like Wild fire, which made old <HI>Ci&s;ly,</HI> between &s;leep and wake, after a yaun or two, &s;tagger down Stairs in her Fur-Mantle, the which, by the rea&s;on of the con|dition &s;he was in, &s;he did not perceive; but getting to the Door as well as &s;he could, &s;he opened it, by drawing back the Bolts; but no &s;ooner did &s;he appear in that frightful form, but tho&s;e that were &s;o ha&s;ty to enter, were ha&s;tier in the Retreat: <HI>Impro&s;pero,</HI> to &s;eem valiant, &s;uppo&s;ing (at fir&s;t) &s;ome Thieves were gotten into the Hou&s;e, drew his Sword; but old <HI>Ci&s;ly,</HI> who began to wonder at their running away, &s;taggering after them, he no &s;ooner beheld her, but &s;eized with a panique fear, drop|ping his Weapon, he betook him&s;elf to his Heels: During which con&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">nation, I and my Dear <HI>Lamira</HI> had opportunity to depart undi&s;covered; to our (then) no &s;mall Joy and Satisfaction.</P>

<P><HI>DVring the long Love-Story and Adventure, the Ship was come within &s;ight of Land, and the Sea running &s;omewhat high, all hands were requi|red, to bring her &s;afe into the Port; which occa&s;ion'd the remainder of this Affair to be referred to a more convenient opportunity; and indeed, what remains may prove both plea&s;ant and delightful in the Relation; which in due place I &s;hall re|member.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Being come nearer the Shore, they found them&s;elves upon the Coa&s;t of</HI> Ireland, <HI>where they &s;oon got on &s;hore;</HI> Hawkwood <HI>and</HI> Lovewell, <HI>upon their Landing, kindly embracing each other; and &s;o refre&s;hing them&s;elves with what the place afforded, and paying their Pa&s;&s;age, they re&s;olved to travel; and with them would go a pretty Youth (as they imagined him) who came over in the &s;ame Ship, but indeed (though contrary to the knowledge of either of them) it was the beautiful</HI> Lamira, <HI>di&s;gui&s;ed in Mans Apparel; as in the &s;equel will appear, to the no &s;mall Ioy of her Lover.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The&s;e Valiant and Ingenuous Youths being in the famous Kingdom of</HI> Ireland, <HI>in pur&s;uit of Fortune's Favour, and taking the third per&s;on into their Society, they travelled through divers places, beholding many Rarities, which that Country affords, and among&s;t the re&s;t, admiring that &s;ingular Gift, &s;aid (according to Tra|dition) to be granted at the humble &s;upplication of St.</HI> Patrick, <HI>their Titular Saint,</HI> viz. <HI>That no venomous Creature breeds there; and that if any happen to be carried over for curio&s;ity's &s;ake, they dye.

<P><HI>Our generous Merchant-Taylors, I &s;ay, being in pur&s;uit of Fame, and tru&s;ting to the favour of Fortune, re&s;olving to gain Renown at what price &s;oever it co&s;t them, de&s;iring nothing more, than to hear of &s;ome dangerous Adventure, by which Honour might be gained, and true Valour &s;ignalized; it &s;o fell out, That being one Evening belated in their Travel, they came to a Gentleman's Hou&s;e in the Province of</HI> Conaught, <HI>publick Inns being but few in tho&s;e parts, and of the Porter demanded whether they might lodge there that night; who told them they might, fora&s;much as it was an Ho&s;pitable place, built for the Reception and Enter|tainment of Strangers: and &s;o he had them into the Hall, where they found not only good Company, but a Table &s;pread with all manner of Provi&s;ions that Rea&s;on could require, and Liquors an&s;werable, e&s;pecially</HI> U&s;quebah, <HI>that reviving Cordial, &s;o much u&s;ed among&s;t the Natives of that Kingdom: And &s;o having refre&s;hed
<PB N="35" REF="21"> them&s;elves, they began to di&s;cour&s;e about divers matters, and among&s;t other things, one of them began to relate the &s;ad misfortune of a beautiful young Gentlewoman, not far di&s;tant from that place, who, by rea&s;on (as he &s;aid) of a fal&s;e Accu&s;ation, was to be put to death, unle&s;s &s;he could meet with a Champion, that would undertake to maintain her Innocence again&s;t her Accu&s;er. This Story our valiant Youths were more than ordinary de&s;irous to hear; in&s;omuch, that &s;ilence being made, the Party thus proceeded:</HI></P>
<P>It &s;o happened, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> that an ancient Gentleman, called <HI>Ianthines,</HI> had by his Wife decea&s;ed, one only Daughter, named <HI>Clarinda,</HI> of Per&s;onage lovely and amiable, and in courteous and mode&s;t Behaviour excelling to a Wonder. This charming Maid no &s;ooner arrived to that perfection of Years, which fully di&s;|covered her excellent Features, but her Beauty captivated the hearts of many; but &s;he prizing Virtue and true Valour more than Wealth, did not return them the &s;atisfaction they &s;o much de&s;ired, but (as it afterward came to light) &s;ettled her Af|fections upon one, who&s;e Fortune &s;eemed ob&s;cure in the Eyes of the re&s;t: Yet many of them finding by &s;undry Tokens, that their Loves were united to that degree, that it would be difficult (if not altogether impo&s;&s;ible) for them to break the Chain, they all of them (except one, more wealthy and powerful than the re&s;t, who thought to overbear him either by Gifts or &s;tratagem) relinqui&s;hed their preten&s;ions: But in the end, this man finding the Beautiful and Virtuous <HI>Clarinda</HI> deaf to his Im|portunities, endeavouring as much as in her lay, to &s;hun and avoid him, being fraught with Malice, he turned the Love he prote&s;ted for this beautiful Creature into Hatred and Revenge; yet fearing the Valour of his Rival, if he &s;hould attempt it again&s;t her by force, he con&s;pires by Fraud, and in that he proceeded after this manner:</P>
<P>He finds an opportunity to contract a familiar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ty with the Waiting-Woman of the beauteous <HI>Clarinda,</HI> in&s;omuch, that through Gifts, and a promi&s;e of Marriage, &s;he was wholly at his Devotion, even (as the Report goes) more than con&s;i&s;ted with the Rules of Mode&s;ty; for pa&s;&s;ionately doating upon him, &s;he &s;uffered him, as often as opportunity did permit, to have his Freedom with her; though he in|tended no other, than to &s;erve his Revenge, by her Credulity, on the innocent <HI>Clarinda:</HI> So that taking his opportunity to meet with <HI>Bernardo,</HI> (for &s;o was <HI>Clarinda's</HI> Lover's Name) he told him, That although his Happine&s;s was great, in having a Virtuous Mi&s;tris, yet he was (as many others had been) very much deceived; for that, although &s;he gave him many &s;mooth Promi&s;es, yet in the mean while, &s;he pro&s;trated her Honour to another. Upon the&s;e words of <HI>Romaldus, Bernardo</HI> grew both angry and impatient, prote&s;ting with his Life to vindicate his Mi&s;tri&s;&s;es Honour, and withal, calling him Traytor to his face; but he not daring to maintain what he &s;aid by force, again&s;t &s;o Renowned a Warriour as <HI>Bernardo,</HI> pacified him with many &s;mooth words; and having by that means brought him to a calmer Temper, he told him, If he would not believe it, he &s;hould the next Evening be a Witne&s;s of it him&s;elf, though he de&s;ired it might be at a di&s;tance, by the light of the Moon; for that, &s;he had (as he &s;ecretly under&s;tood by &s;ome that were about her) appointed (as &s;he u&s;ually did) her Lover to come, at a certain hour, who, by the help of a Rope-Ladder, which &s;he promi&s;ed to fa&s;ten to the Balcony, was to a&s;cend to his Joy, and revel in her Arms all night.</P>
<P>This, though <HI>Bernardo</HI> could not well believe, yet hearing it &s;poke w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">th &s;uch earne&s;tne&s;s, and &s;o well vouched, he con&s;ented, even for Curio&s;ity &s;ake, to attend

<Q><L>I Wake, and &s;ee what I could wi&s;h t' have been</L>
<L>Born without Eyes, that I might not have &s;een;</L>
<L>Or rather not to have been born. Curs'd Fate!</L>
<L>Why ha&s;t thou thus prolong'd my Life's &s;ad Date,</L>
<L>To bring me to this killing Spectacle?</L>
<L><HI>Bernardo,</HI> more tormented than in Hell.</L>
<L>Dye then <HI>Bernardo</HI>&mdash; How, Dye! Dye, and give</L>

<L>Let Death and Ruin guide me where he lyes,</L>
<L>To kill him in the height of all his Joys:</L>
<L>But is't not ba&s;e to kill him by &s;urprize?</L>
<L>What if her Wrongs I openly &s;hould right?</L>
<L>That wou'd proclaim the Cau&s;e for which we fight:</L>

<L>I, but the Blood may, if I kill him there,</L>

<L>What need I care? Yes; but the Murther known,</L>
<L>Betrays the Cau&s;e for which the Murther's done.</L>
<L>But her &s;tain'd blood has not &s;o quench'd my Flame;</L>
<L>I'd kill her Guilt, but would not wound her Fame.</L></Q></P>
<P>And thus having with &s;ighs and tears debated his Misfortune, he undertook to Travel into Forreign Lands, little perhaps knowing the Mi&s;ery, and much le&s;s the Innocence of fair <HI>Clarinda;</HI> who being &s;ince accu&s;ed by <HI>Romaldus,</HI> of what &s;he is altogether innocent, in defect of a Champion that will undertake her Quarrel, is not only like to &s;uffer &s;hame and di&s;grace, but lo&s;e her Life: For though the Treachery has been di&s;covered, it has not gained Belief; as being over-born by the Power and A&s;&s;everation of <HI>Romaldus.</HI></P>

And now a Third Champion being wanting, the&s;e Two valiant Youths re&s;olved to encounter the Three Brothers; and &s;o early in the morning they entred the Li&s;t, well mounted, and armed at all points; but then found another Knight in black Armour, and the Portraicture of a Virgin on his Shield, to Rank with them: by which means their number being equal, they ru&s;hed together with great fury, in&s;omuch, that <HI>Romaldus</HI> and <HI>Cormondel,</HI> again&s;t whom <HI>Hawkwood</HI> and <HI>Lovewell</HI> run, were beaten to the ground: And as for the other Two, their Launces breaking, &s;hivered in the Air; but &s;oon recovering, they drew their Swords, whereupon a dreadful Fight began, which filled the Spectators with Hope and Fear, according as they &s;ided, or took part in their affections with either &s;ide; and for a while the Succe&s;s &s;tood doubtful: but <HI>Hawkwood,</HI> impatient of any long delay, laying upon the Shield of <HI>Romaldus</HI> with a forcible blow, &s;mote it in &s;under, and gave him a deep wound in the Left Shoulder; whil&s;t <HI>Lovewell</HI> did much the like by <HI>Cormondel:</HI> Nor was the Champion in black Armour idle, but fiercely charged upon <HI>Grim&s;allow,</HI> verily believing him to be <HI>Romaldus,</HI> who&s;e u&s;ual Armour he indeed had on. <HI>Clarinda</HI> and <HI>Lorenzo,</HI> who all this while beheld the Fight, were in a deep heavine&s;s and anxiety, the one for her Honour, that were at &s;take, and the other for her Love, that was as dear as both: But <HI>Hawkwood</HI> &s;oon gave them hope, by turning the Seale; for &s;till pur&s;uing <HI>Romaldus</HI> with a forcible blow, he bur&s;t his Helmet in &s;under, and the Sword entering deep into his Head, he fell from his Hor&s;e, and greatly brui&s;ed him&s;elf in the Fall; &s;o that whil&s;t the other Four were hotly engaged, he alighting, clapped his Sword to his Brea&s;t, bidding him either confe&s;s the abu&s;e he had done, or expect no longer Life; whereupon per|ceiving his two Brethren di&s;mounted, and much wounded, after having begged Mercy, he declared the Story from end to end, as it has been related, with greater aggravations, craving a Thou&s;and Pardons for the wrongs he had done the fair <HI>Clarinda;</HI> and &s;o the compa&s;&s;ionate Lady, upon his humble &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, interceding for him, who had little de&s;erved it at her hands, he had his Life given him; as al&s;o had his Brothers, upon the like &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and their confe&s;&s;ing a true &s;en&s;e of &s;or|row for undertaking &s;o unju&s;t a Quarrel; and &s;oon after (being recovered of their wounds) they for grief and &s;hame left the Country; <HI>Celinda,</HI> the waiting-Woman being (after her delivery out of the Ruffians hands) fled, for fear of Puni&s;hment: And &s;o the three Champions were with Triumph conducted to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Clarin|da</HI>'s Father, where they were highly welcomed and applauded: So that now, in&s;tead of Mourning, nothing but Mu&s;ick and Fea&s;ting was to be found.

<P>THe Adventure of the Lady being &s;omewhat &s;trange, though Love (as I have &s;aid) takes the Diadem from Queens, and where it is truly fervent, in &s;pight of the nice and trouble&s;ome Laws of Mode&s;ty, and ba&s;hful Nature, or Re&s;traint, will blow the Pa&s;&s;ion into a vi&s;ible Flame; and &s;o in this ca&s;e it happened: Where|fore <HI>Lorenzo,</HI> or the di&s;gui&s;ed <HI>Lamira,</HI> not being ignorant of the Promi&s;e that was made, after Supper was ended, began to ca&s;t about how &s;he might &s;atisfie <HI>Lucrina</HI>'s expectation, and come off with Honour; and not being willing to di&s;cover her &s;elf as to what &s;he was, till a further opportunity required it, &s;he thought not fit to acquaint any of tho&s;e &s;he termed her Companions, and who&s;e Hearts &s;he knew were taken up el&s;ewhere, of the matter: But ca&s;ting her Eyes (as &s;he imagined) upon a hand&s;ome young Gentleman, newly arrived, whom &s;he conceited &s;omewhat to re&s;emble her &s;elf, &s;he re&s;olved to let him know the Intreague; and withal, to tell him, if &s;he had not been already engaged beyond reca&s;t, &s;he would not have refu&s;ed &s;o worthy an Offer, but have e&s;teemed it as a Favour, ca&s;t upon her by the &s;miles of Fortune: And &s;o taking her opportunity, &s;he di&s;covered whatever had happened on that kind, together with the Promi&s;e &s;he had made: But the &s;uppo&s;ed Gentle|man being no more capable of plea&s;uring the Lady in her expectation, than her &s;elf, to her no &s;mall wonder, refu&s;ed the Offer, without giving any rea&s;on for &s;o doing; for indeed he was no other than the fair <HI>Dori da;</HI> who hearing of <HI>Hawkwood</HI>'s Renown, and by this time weaned from her covetous di&s;po&s;ition, repenting the hard u&s;age &s;he had given him, ca&s;t off her &s;econd Lover, and with &s;uch Trea&s;ure as &s;he could conveniently convey away, was come in &s;earch of him in di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Lorenzo</HI> thus refu&s;ed by the &s;uppo&s;ed Gentleman, re&s;olved rather to go her &s;elf, than to break her word; but whil&s;t &s;he was con&s;idering on this point, withal wondering, that &s;o Noble an Offer &s;hould be rejected, it came into her mind, that the Party who refu&s;ed it, mu&s;t undoubtedly be &s;ome &s;uch Adventurer as her &s;elf, or otherways be cold to love, if no pre-engagement had &s;eized that Heart, which promp|ted the Tongue to refu&s;e to charming an Enterprize; and withal, &s;he began to blu&s;h and condemn her &s;elf, for di&s;covering the weakne&s;s, or rather the effects of <HI>Lucrina</HI>'s unfeigned love: Yet notwith&s;tanding, at the Time and Place appointed they met, and there renewing the former Di&s;cour&s;e, at the wondrous importunity of the amorous Lady, who&s;e Di&s;cour&s;e Love &s;haping in a Thou&s;and extravagant Expre&s;|&s;ions, it was agreed, that for the better &s;ecre&s;ie, the Nuptials &s;hould be &s;olemnized the Evening of the next day; <HI>Lorenzo</HI> knowing, that if no other way was found to colour the De&s;ign, it would prove but a frolick in the end; and &s;o <HI>Lucrina</HI> pro|mi&s;ing to give nece&s;&s;ary Orders to a Nur&s;e of hers, who lived &s;ome di&s;tance from her Vncle's Hou&s;e, and in whom (by rea&s;on of the many Obligations &s;he had layd upon her) &s;he doubted not, but &s;he might confide; they parted.</P>

<PB N="51" REF="29"> and &s;o, in the&s;e and other plea&s;ant Conceits, they at la&s;t came to the place where the Sports were appointed, and there they found not only a Noble and Illu&s;trious A&s;&s;embly of &s;pectators, of either Sex, but the Knights (Challengers, in honour of their Mi&s;tri&s;&s;es) daring the Combat; which made <HI>Hawkwood</HI> and <HI>Lovewell</HI> rejoyce, as not de&s;iring a more favourable opportunity to expre&s;s how much they loved; &s;o that pau&s;ing a while, and perceiving none in a readine&s;s to undertake them, they boldly entred, again&s;t whom two of the Knights prepared, and meeting in a full Career with their Launces, they &s;hivered them in the Air; yet &s;o forcibly <HI>Hawk|wood</HI> bore on with the Truncheon of his Launce, that he tumbled him that run again&s;t him to the ground; but he &s;oon mounting, they drew their Swords, (as did <HI>Lovewell</HI> and the other, who had pa&s;&s;ed in a full Career) and skirmi&s;hed with &s;uch fury, that the two Knights Armour being broken, and them&s;elves having re|ceived &s;ome wounds, and more brui&s;es, threw down their Swords, in token of yiel|ding; when as two others advanced, but were no better welcomed; &s;o that in the end, they kept the Li&s;t alone, none daring adventure again&s;t them, &s;uppo&s;ing them more than Men, which cau&s;ed the Tour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ey to cea&s;e: After which, they were invi|ted by the Noble-Man to his Hou&s;e, and with high Applau&s;e magnificently enter|tain'd; the young Ladies that were come thither to the Solemnity, and beholding their Manly Beauty, when unarmed, not refraining to expre&s;s an extraordinary E&s;teem of their Magnanimity and true Heroickne&s;s, but by their Eyes and Ge&s;ture let them &s;ee their Pa&s;&s;ion went further: Which <HI>Lorenzo</HI> and <HI>Orlando</HI> well noting, and fearing that among &s;o many Beauties, &s;ome might fire their Affections, &s;eeing they (as yet) were in little hope of enjoying tho&s;e they de&s;ired, they thought it high time to call them off; and therefore, having made both their Sex and the My&s;tery of their Loves known to each other, they re&s;olved to write each of them a Letter, as from <HI>England,</HI> and to have them delivered (as &s;uch) to a tru&s;ty Me&s;&s;enger, whom they would over-and-above bribe to &s;ilence, that &s;o, by that means, they might im|mediately pa&s;s thither, and by making them&s;elves known in their proper Habit, make their Lovers happy: <HI>Lorenzo</HI> now not fearing (at the interce&s;&s;ion of her Brother) to gain her Parents con&s;ent; and <HI>Orlando</HI> knew well, that hers would rejoyce at nothing more, than &s;o happy a Conjunction.

<P>How upon their returning to <HI>England,</HI> they found <HI>Lorenzo</HI> and <HI>Orlando</HI> to be <HI>Lamira</HI> and <HI>Dorinda;</HI> and the means by which they were deceived: And how they were married by the Con&s;ent of their Parents, lived and dyed happy; with other things; as their being Knighted; with their further Atchievements.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe Letters being filled with &s;o many known Circum&s;tances, and in the known Hands, upon &s;ight thereof our Champions were &s;truck with much amazement, and to ask further in relation to them, they knew not where, or of whom, &s;eeing they were delivered by an unknown hand, and that the Me&s;&s;enger, as &s;oon as he had
<PB N="52" REF="30"> delivered them, had withdrawn him&s;elf, they knew not whither; &s;o that having con&s;ulted each other, and finding the circum&s;tances on either hand wonderfully coherent, Ioy and Doubt, or Fear, &s;truggled &s;o much in their Brea&s;ts, that they &s;carce knew what to conclude; but in t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e end re&s;olving to omit nothing that might render them &s;o much felicity, as &s;o fair an opportunity promi&s;ed, they concluded to run the hazard of cro&s;&s;ing the Seas, having directions where to come; and &s;o much they communicated to the di&s;gui&s;ed Ladies, entreating them that they would bear them company, who (after &s;ome Excu&s;es in relation to the danger they had been in at Sea before, and what might further happen) con&s;ented: And &s;o taking leave of <HI>Gonzalus,</HI> the Noble-Man, and his Family, who di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them with Rewards, and many &s;ignal Favours of Love and Applau&s;e, with a pro&s;perous Gale, they arrived in <HI>England,</HI> not only in gallant Apparel, but &s;tored with Iewels and Gold, and ha&s;ted to <HI>London,</HI> where their Mi&s;tri&s;&s;es pretended to lye concealed, in expectation of their arrival; where the bu&s;ine&s;s being layd by the two di&s;gui&s;ed Ladies, with the Wo|man of the Hou&s;e, who was a Kin&s;woman of <HI>Lorenzo,</HI> or <HI>Lamira,</HI> for &s;o I mu&s;t &s;hortly call her, &s;he procured them co&s;tly Female Attire, pretending the mean while to our impatient Lovers that they were a day too &s;oon, for that the Ladies had not promi&s;ed to be there till the day en&s;uing: And &s;o after much fea&s;ting and rejoycing, all things being now provided, the di&s;gui&s;ed Ladies the next morning a&s;&s;umed them|&s;elves, by putting on their proper Habits having in their other Habits pretended, that the &s;ame morning they would go abroad to &s;ee the Town.</P>
<P>Matters being brought to this pa&s;s, and Fate re&s;olving no longer to with&s;tand the Happine&s;s of our Lovers they were introduced into the Chamber where their Mi&s;tri&s;&s;es &s;ate in &s;umptuous Attire, at the fir&s;t &s;ight of whom they were &s;truck with &s;uch amazement, that they could &s;ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ce believe, but that it was rather a plea|&s;ing Vi&s;ion, than true; but when they were throughly convinced of the reality, and made &s;en&s;ible of all that had happened, What Tongue can expre&s;s the Ioy and Won|der that at once &s;urprized them?

<ARGUMENT>
<P>OR, A Recital of &s;everal Worthy, Magnificent, and Charitable Acts of the <HI>Merchant-Taylors,</HI> as they are found upon Record, and vi&s;ibly extant, to the no &s;mall Honour of that Wor&s;hipful Society, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HAving delivered a Hi&s;tory in it &s;elf, (as I take it) not a little plea&s;ant; I &s;hall now come to a more &s;erious Relation of many things worthy of note, which I have cho&s;en to fix as an Appendix, not think<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ng it &s;o convenient, to bring it into the foregoing Pages; which take as followeth:</P>
<P>The Wor&s;hipful Company of <HI>Merchant-Taylors</HI> have been a Guild or Fraternity time out of mind, by the Name of <HI>Taylors,</HI> and <HI>Linnen-Armourers:</HI> For I find, that <HI>Edward</HI> the Fir&s;t, in the 28th. Year of his Raign, confirmed this Guild under the Names afore&s;aid, and gave to the B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ethren thereof Leave and Licence every <HI>Mid|&s;ummer</HI> to hold a Fea&s;t, and then to chu&s;e them a Governour, or Ma&s;ter, with War|dens. Whereupon, on the &s;aid day, in the Year 1300. they cho&s;e <HI>Henry de Rayl</HI> to be their Pilgrim, for the Ma&s;ter of this My&s;tery (as one that travel'd for the whole Company) was &s;o called, until the Eleventh Year of <HI>Richard</HI> the Second; and the four Wardens, then called Purve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ors of Alms, now known by the Name of Quar|tridge, of the &s;aid Fraternity.</P>
<P>The &s;tately Hall belonging to the Company of <HI>Merchant-Taylors,</HI> is &s;cituate in <HI>Threadne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">dle-&s;treet;</HI> &s;ometimes the Hou&s;e of a Wor&s;hipful Gentleman, named <HI>Edmond Crepin,</HI> who in the Sixth of <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, <HI>Anno</HI> 1331. for a certain Sum of Money, made his Grant thereof, by the Name of his Principal Me&s;&s;uage, to <HI>John Yakely,</HI> the King's Pavilion-maker, and was thereupon called <HI>New-Hall,</HI> or
<PB N="54" REF="31"> <HI>Taylors-Inn:</HI> And in the 21. Year of <HI>Edward</HI> the Fourth, Sir <HI>Thomas Holm,</HI> one of the Kings of Arms, granted by his Patent this Company for their Arms, <HI>(Viz.)</HI> In a Field of Silver, a Pavilion between two Royal Mantles, Purple gar|ni&s;hed with Gold, in a chief Azure, a Holy Lamb incircled with Rayes, the Cre&s;t upon the Helm, a Pavilion purple, garni&s;hed with Gold, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>As a further mark of Honour, King <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh favoured this Company, with conde&s;cending to be free of it; as many of his Predece&s;&s;ors the Kings of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> had been; <HI>(Viz.) Richard</HI> the Second, <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth, <HI>Henry</HI> the Fifth, <HI>Henry</HI> the Sixth, <HI>Edward</HI> the Fourth, <HI>Richard</HI> the Third, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And for that divers of that Fraternity trading in Merchandi&s;e, abroad and at home, to the great enrich|ing and advantage of the Kingdom, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Therefore did the &s;aid <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh (by his e&s;pecial Grant) Incorporate them, by the Names of Ma&s;ters and Wardens, <HI>Merchant-Taylors,</HI> of the Fraternity of St. <HI>John</HI> Bapti&s;t, in the City of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Thus having &s;poken briefly of the Original Ri&s;e and Encrea&s;e of this worthy Company, I now proceed to tell of what more redounds to their Honour, <HI>(Viz.)</HI> They have in their Care and Protection a famous Grammar-School, known by the Name of <HI>Merchant-Taylors Free-School,</HI> founded by the Ma&s;ter and Wardens of that Company, <HI>Anno</HI> 1561. in <HI>Suffolk-lane,</HI> in the Pari&s;h of St. <HI>Lawrence Pount|ney;</HI> and near to it, divers Alms-hou&s;es, in which are generally placed Seven de|cayed Men of the Company, and their Wives, if they have any, and had at fir&s;t the Allowance of Fourteen pence a week each, but &s;ince encrea&s;ed to the Sum of Five pounds four &s;hillings the Year, to each, pay'd Quarterly, be&s;ides Firing; and yet more to each of them Twenty &s;hillings yearly; being the Gift of <HI>Walter Fi&s;h,</HI> &s;ometime Ma&s;ter of the &s;aid Company.</P>
<P>At the We&s;t-End of <HI>Hog-&s;treet,</HI> by <HI>Tower-Hill,</HI> they have divers fair Alms-hou&s;es, wherein live fourteen poor &s;ingle Women, who receive better than Sixteen pence a week each, being pay'd weekly, be&s;ide Eight pound Fifteen &s;hillings, pay'd yearly, out of the common Trea&s;ury, for the provi&s;ion of Fewel. Nor has the boun|teous Liberality of private Members of this Company, at any time been inferiour to the be&s;t; of which, that their Fame may live as a Pattern to others, to emulate or imitate, I &s;hall particularize a few, <HI>(Viz.)</HI></P>
<P><HI>Robert Thorn,</HI> Merchant-Taylor, dying <HI>Anno</HI> 1532. bequeathed by his Te&s;ta|ment, to &s;undry charitable u&s;es, in Goods and Moneys, upward of the value of Four Thou&s;and pounds; together with Five Thou&s;and One Hundred and Forty pounds to his Relations; and yet proceeding to a Charity no le&s;s than the former, he over-and-above forgave his Debtors all they owed him.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Thomas Whirt,</HI> who was Lord Mayor of the Honourable City of <HI>London, Anno</HI> 1534. and a Brother of this Society, founded St. <HI>John</HI> Bapti&s;t College in <HI>Oxford,</HI> erected Schools at <HI>Bri&s;tol, Reading,</HI> and another College at <HI>Higham Fer|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ies,</HI> and di&s;tributed &s;everal Thou&s;ands of pounds to other Charitable V&s;es.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Thomas Row,</HI> Knight, Lord Mayor of the honourable City of <HI>London, Anno</HI> 1568. a Member of this Society, erected the new Church-Yard in <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> and gave an Hundred pounds to be &s;ent to Eight poor men, without V&s;e; and Forty pounds a Year for ever, to maintain Ten poor Men, to be cho&s;en out of five &s;everal Companys, <HI>(Viz.)</HI> Cloth-workers, Armourers, Tylers, Carpenters, and Plai|&s;terers.</P>
