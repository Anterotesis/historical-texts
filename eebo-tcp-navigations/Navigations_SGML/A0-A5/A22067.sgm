<P><HI>_WHereas by an Acte of Parliament made in the two and twentieth</HI> yeere of the Reigne of Our mo&s;t noble Progenitour King <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth; It was (among&s;t other things) ordeined, that all Merchants which &s;hould carie or bring any merchandize out of Scotland, or the I&s;les of the &s;ame into this Realme of England or Wales, fir&s;t &s;hould bring the &s;ame merchandize to the Towne of <HI>Berwicke:</HI> And that none of the Kings liege people, nor none other per&s;on vnder the Kings obey|&s;ance &s;hould carie any merchandize, or cau&s;e it to bee carried into this Realme of England, or any other place vnder the Kings obey&s;ance: But that the &s;ame merchan|dize &s;hould be cu&s;tomed at the &s;ame Towne of <HI>Berwicke,</HI> except to the Citie of <HI>Carlile,</HI> and the Ports or Creekes pertaining to the We&s;t Marches: And that no merchandize &s;hould bee &s;hipped in any Creeke, or other place betwixt <HI>Tinmouth</HI> and the &s;aid Towne of <HI>Berwicke;</HI> but onely in the Port or Hauen of the &s;aid Towne of <HI>Berwicke:</HI> And that if any per&s;on or per&s;ons &s;hould offend, or do with any maner merchandize afore&s;aid, contrary to any of the &s;aid ordinances, the &s;ame per&s;on or per|&s;ons &s;hould forfeit all the &s;aid merchandize, and that it &s;hould be lawfull to any of the Kings liege Subiects to &s;eize all &s;uch merchandize &s;o forfeited, or el&s;e to pur&s;ue in his owne name an Action of debt again&s;t the &s;ame per&s;on or per&s;ons which &s;o &s;hould forfeit, conteining the &s;umme of the va|lue of the &s;aid goods, and the King to haue a&s;well the one halfe of all &s;uch merchandize forfeited and &s;eized, as the one halfe of all &s;uch &s;ummes of money, which &s;hould be recouered by the Action in the forme afore&s;aid, to bee pur&s;ued for the value of any &s;uch goods &s;o forfeit, and the per&s;on or per&s;ons which &s;hould &s;eize, and pur&s;ue in the forme afore&s;aid, to haue the other halfe of the &s;ame, as by the &s;ame Acte of Parliament (among&s;t other things) more at large appeareth.</P>
<P>And whereas We were giuen to vnder&s;tand in the fir&s;t yeere of our Reigne of our Realme of England, that &s;ince our entrie into this Kingdome, many of our &s;ubiects of our Realme of Scot|land, and &s;ome al&s;o of England did not ob&s;erue the &s;ame Acte of Parliament, but to the intent to defraud vs of our &s;aid Cu&s;tomes, did goe with their goods and merchandizes ouer the Felles, and other by-pa&s;&s;ages, whereby great damage was then done to vs:</P>
<P>And whereas Wee, for that cau&s;e at that time did by our Proclamation &s;traitly charge and command all Our Subiects, a&s;well of the one Realme as of the other, that none of them &s;hould pre&s;ume after that time to pa&s;&s;e any goods from each Realme to other, but either &s;hipped at &s;ome knowen Port, or el&s;e through Our &s;aid citie of <HI>Carlile,</HI> or Towne of <HI>Berwicke,</HI> as by the &s;ame Procla|mation may al&s;o appeare.</P>

<P>And whereas We haue beene plea&s;ed of long time to forbeare to take any Cu&s;tomes, or other Duties, of any of Our Subiects of Scotland, for any goods pa&s;&s;ing betwixt Our &s;aid King|domes, vntill now of late: During which time, Our Subiects did ob&s;erue a&s;well the &s;aid Acte of Parliament, as the &s;aid Proclamation: And fora&s;much, as We are now againe informed, that Our &s;aid Subiects, &s;ince We haue giuen order to Our Officers to receaue Our Cu&s;tomes, for goods &s;o caried betweene both Our &s;aid Kingdomes, doe now againe goe with their goods and merchandize ouer the &s;aid fels, and other by-pa&s;&s;ages, and &s;hip the &s;ame at &s;ecret, ob&s;cure, and vnknowen places, a&s;well to the great damage and lo&s;&s;e vnto Vs, in Our Cu&s;tomes and Sub&s;i|dies, as vnto Our Subiects, both of this Our Realme of England, and al&s;o of Our Realme of Scotland, both by carying of goods prohibited to be caried out of this Our Realme into Our &s;aid Realme of Scotland, and from thence into the forreine parts: and al&s;o by bringing of goods prohibited to be caried out of Our &s;aid Realme of Scotland, into this Our Realme of England, and from hence carying the &s;ame into other forreine parts.</P>
<P>We minding to take away all &s;uch excu&s;es as may be made in that behalfe, doe therefore by the&s;e pre&s;ents make it knowen to all Our louing Subiects, that We doe intend to haue the &s;ame Acte of Parliament, and all others of like effect put in &s;trait execution in all things aboue menti|oned, for and concerning land carriages, and &s;uch goods as &s;hall be &s;hipped at &s;uch &s;ecret, ob&s;cure, and vnknowen places, and to haue the &s;ame very carefully ob&s;erued, performed, fulfilled, and kept, to the onely end, that We, or Our Fermours may be truely an&s;wered of Our due cu&s;tomes, Sub&s;idies, and other duties due for &s;uch goods.</P>
<P>And for that purpo&s;e, We doe heereby authorize, and &s;traitly charge, will and require, a&s;well Our Cu&s;tomers, Comptrollers, Searchers, &amp; other Our Officers, in Our Ports and Cu&s;tome hou&s;es; As al&s;o all Our Lieuetennants, Deputie Lieuetenants, Maiors, Sheriffes, Bayliffes, Con&s;tables, and other Our Officers, Mini&s;ters, and Subiects what&s;oeuer, whom it &s;hall con|cerne, not onely to &s;ee to the due execution of the &s;ame Acte of Parliament them&s;elues, to their be&s;t knowledge and &s;kill: but al&s;o to be aiding and a&s;&s;i&s;ting to all others, that &s;hall endeauour to &s;ee the &s;ame put in execution, as is fit; as they will an&s;were the contrary at their vttermo&s;t perills.</P>
