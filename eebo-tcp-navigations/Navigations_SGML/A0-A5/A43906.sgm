<OPENER><SALUTE>Reader.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_ABout <HI>18</HI> Moneths agoe I did write and publi&s;h. The Fa|mous History of <HI>Don Belli|anis</HI> of <HI>Greece,</HI> or The Ho|nour of Chivalry in three Parts; In my Preface to the Reader I gaue an ac|count of mo&s;t of the Hi&s;to|ries that are Printed and publi&s;hed in our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongue, I did recommend them in general to thy reading, but <HI>I</HI> was more par|ticular in my recommendations of one entitled, The Seven Wi&s;e Ma&s;ters, for <HI>I</HI> placed it in the Front na|ming it the fir&s;t of all others. It being of &s;o great e|&s;teem in <HI>Ireland,</HI> that next to the Horn-book and knowledge of Letters, Children are in general put to read in it, and I know that only by that Book &s;everall have Learned to read well, &s;o great is the plea&s;ure that young and old take in reading thereof.</P>
<P>Since my writting that Book, I chanced to meet with an old Book entitled, The Hi&s;tory of Prince <HI>E|ra&s;tus</HI> in <HI>French,</HI> and upon reading &s;ome part of it, <HI>I</HI> found it to be not only The Hi&s;tory of <HI>Era&s;tus,</HI> but al&s;o of The Seven Wi&s;e Ma&s;ters of <HI>Rome;</HI> and to con|teine all tho&s;e Stories that are in the former Book of
<PB REF="3"> the &s;even Wi&s;e Ma&s;ters; I compared them one with an other and &s;aw that though the &s;everal Stories were a|like, yet my <HI>French</HI> book was much the better, being larger and conteining more variety of Stories then the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> one which was not only very &s;hort in the Sub|stance but al&s;o &s;o old in the language that it was hardly good &s;ence: <HI>I</HI> therefore thought it might be worth my while to Tran&s;late and print this <HI>French</HI> book; where|fore <HI>I</HI> fell to work and have now perfected it to my great co&s;t and trouble, my co&s;t hath been extraordinary in the Pictures, for I have be&s;towed more on this book then are in any book of this bigne&s;s in <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> &s;o that the Rea|der may read every particular of all the Hi&s;tories in Picture; and indeed Picture is not only convenient, but nece&s;&s;ary in all Hi&s;tories of this nature there is &s;o great affinity between them, that Picture is &s;aid to be Dumb or &s;ilent Hi&s;tory &amp; Hi&s;tory to be &s;peaking Picture there being a Poetical Art <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">o be u&s;ed in both, <HI>Pictoribus at|que Poetis.</HI> This book being thus chargable to me, <HI>I</HI> hope the Reader will con&s;ider me in the price, if the former were &s;o well accepted, <HI>I</HI> doubt not but this will be as well received <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> as it exceed, that in price &s;o <HI>I</HI> do a&s;&s;ure thee it exceeds that in w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 span"> ha&s;t now all that was ever written on this &s;ubject in any language what|&s;oever for <HI>I</HI> have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 span"> Tran&s;lated the <HI>French</HI> book, but al&s;o compared it with the Originall in <HI>Italian,</HI> and added to that all that hath been written in <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>

<P>The Soldier having worn out his patience with atten+dance, went to the old womans who had been his broak|er in this intended Merchandize; and tells her of his fruitle&s;s attendance &s;he wonders at it and pre&s;ently goes back with him to the hou&s;e, where having a Key &s;he en|ters the Gate, and leaving the Soldier in an outer Court went towards the hou&s;e where &s;he &s;aw the young Lady in the Pond in the manner her husband had left her. After &s;ome &s;mall Dialogue, whereby they both under|&s;tood how the State of their affairs &s;tood; the young La|dy having &s;till a mind to enjoy her Gallant, it was a|greed that the old one &s;hould un&s;trip and &s;tand in her stead, while&s;t &s;he went to her Lover. The young woman being dre&s;&s;ed in the Old womans cloathes went to the Soldier, who at fir&s;t took her to be the <HI>Matron,</HI> but by her &s;peech finding it to be otherwi&s;e, he &s;oon enjoyed tho&s;e plea&s;ures they had &s;o long de&s;ired.</P>
<P>The old Gentleman who was gone to bed could not &s;leep for thinking of that nights adventure, and believing that he was not &s;ufficiently revenged on his wife he re&s;olves on a further, and leaving his bed goes down to the place where he left his wife, and utters outragious &s;peeches again&s;t her, which the old woman who was there, thought was be&s;t not to an&s;wer but to remain &s;i|lent; at which he was &s;o, enraged that having a Knife in one hand he took her by the no&s;e and cut it off, throw|ing it at her face, and wi&s;hing her to pre&s;ent it to her Lover, he returns to bed. Soon after the Lady having taken leave of her young man, returnes to the old wo|man; who although almost dead with her wound gives her an account of her misfortune &s;he hears this Story with admiration, e&s;teeming her &s;elf doubly happy in ha|ving enjoyed her friends love, and e&s;caped her hus|bnads fury: and now &s;he comforts the old woman by
<PB REF="5"> promi&s;cing her a great reward. This pacified her, and the young woman believing that the wor&s;t was past &amp; that better was to come, unty'd the old one, and again took her place in the water, where having contriv'd how to mannage her matter &s;o as to come off with honour; &s;he thus plaid her trick. Believing that her husband was within hearing as indeed he was, She with a Low voice makes a heavy complaint again&s;t him that had &s;o w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ongd his innocent and chast wife, and then &s;he Im|plores the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Diana</HI> and all the other Godde&s;s|es of Cha&s;tity and Marriage to vindicate her and that they would &s;hew &s;ome example on her, to demon&s;trate her Cha&s;tity; and if they plea&s;ed to be &s;o gracious to her to re&s;tore that former Beauty which her husband had deprived her of, by ra&s;h &amp; unhumane cutting off her no&s;e. This was the &s;um of her complaint &amp; prayer, &amp; then continuing for &s;ome time &s;ilent &s;he at length brake forth into lowd exclaimations of joy &amp; thank&s;giving to the heavenly powers for her re&s;toration, calling to her husband to come and &s;ee the token of her innocence: <HI>He</HI> being amazed at this di&s;cour&s;e was re&s;olved to try the truth, &amp; ri&s;eing out of his bed lighted a candle, went down and comes to his wife, and beholding her face finds it whole and &s;ound: whereat &s;tanding amazed he began to dete&s;t his ra&s;hne&s;s and fear heavens vengeance and deprecating the wickedne&s;s of his impious fury; he loo&s;|eth his mo&s;t cha&s;t wife and brings her again to her bed, &s;he by this means recovering both her no&s;e &amp; the affection of her husband. And now Reader let this Story &s;uf|fice as the fir&s;t Di&s;h of meat you are to have at this ban|quet, which <HI>I</HI> hope will plea&s;e your pallet; wherefore I pray fall too and much good may it do you</P>

<P>ONE Thou&s;and and forty years after the foun|dation of the Citty of <HI>Rome,</HI> the Emperour <HI>Diocle&s;ian,</HI> a wi&s;e and powerful Prince, reigned in
<PB N="2" REF="7"> that Superb and Tryumphant City, he being mar|ried to a very fair and virtuous Prince&s;s: had by her a Son who was &s;o well proportioned, and of &s;o exqui&s;ite beauty, that every one concluded him to be more Divine than Humain; in &s;uch manner that the affection which all the world had for the &s;ingu|larities and graces of this young Prince, cau&s;ed that the name of <HI>Era&s;tus</HI> was given to him, which is as much as to &s;ay amiable, and although he was but yet in his very infancy, yet in that tender age, every one concluded that in time this young Prince would arrive to very great perfection, and would not be in any thing inferiour to the other Emperours his Predece&s;&s;ors; and moreover there was not any Mathematician, A&s;trologer, Diviner, Phy&s;iognomi&s;t nor Chyromancer, who did not e|very one re&s;pectively finde by his Art, that accord|ing to the influences of the Caele&s;tial Planets, this Child &s;hould be of an admirable Spirit; very &s;in|gular in all Sciences, and accompli&s;hed in all man|ner of virtue, wherein the Emperor took &s;o great content as the Maje&s;ty of his degree, and the gran|deur of &s;uch a Father did require; purpo&s;ing on his part not to fru&s;trate &s;o good a Nature, but to u&s;e his endeavour to render his Son, &s;uch as the opinion of the world had conceived of him. And for a&s;much as nei|ther Illu&s;trious blood, good Con&s;tellations, nor large E&s;tates, are not of them&s;elves &s;ufficient to render a man great, if Nature be not helped and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Sciences and Vertues; therefore &s;o &s;oon as this In|fant <HI>Era&s;tus</HI> was of an Age fit for to learn, the Em|perour provided him&s;elf of the mo&s;t knowing men that he could find, whereby he might be in|&s;tructed,
<PB N="3" REF="7"> under who&s;e tuition he &s;o well profited, that at the age of ten years he began to have a ta&s;te of the &s;ecrets of Phylo&s;ophy; and the good Em|perour very well knowing that the Wi&s;dome and Prudence of the Son, does ordinarily redound to the glory of the Father, and therefore re&s;olving to render his Son perfect in Phylo&s;ophy, he (from among&s;t all the Wi&s;e Men of his Empire) made choice of &s;even Phylo&s;ophers, of who&s;e skill and knowledge he had &s;ufficient experience, that he might confidently commit the charge of &s;uch a Per|&s;on, who in time might &s;ucceed to the Government of the great Roman Empire The Emperour having thus delivered his Son to their charge, commanded them to in&s;truct him with the greate&s;t dexterity, as well in Vertue and good Manners, as in Letters, and all &s;orts of Sciences, that all the world might know of what a Father this young Prince was Son: and by what admirable Ma&s;ters he had been in|&s;tructed, promi&s;ing to the&s;e Phylo&s;ophers very great recompences, be&s;ides the Honour they would acquire of all the World, by the good doctrine wherein they would in&s;truct the Prince,</P>
<P>The&s;e Philo&s;ophers having with merry hearts taken this charge, by rea&s;on of the Divine Spirit which they knew to be in the young <HI>Era&s;tus,</HI> which gave them hopes that they &s;hould attain to great honour in the execution thereof; and that they might the better execute it, they made choice of a place without the City of <HI>Rome,</HI> which was very well &s;c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">tuated, and enriched with all things nece&s;&s;a|ry for the entertainment of man; for in the fir&s;t place, the Air was there very temperate, there was
<PB N="4" REF="8"> very plea&s;ant walks, enriched with fair Fountains, the playn was very con&s;iderable, for the great num|ber of Springs and Rivers, which running through it, at la&s;t met in a little lake, which was furni&s;hed withall &s;orts of fi&s;hes: there might you &s;ee all &s;orts of trees, as well Fruit-trees as others, and all the Fields enameled with Flowers according to the &s;ea|&s;on; all accompanied with a World of Birds, who by their various Notes, rendred a continual Harmo|ny both night and day. In this plea&s;ant place was a Pallace built for the Prince <HI>Era&s;tus,</HI> that he might be at &s;ome di&s;tance from the noi&s;e of the City of <HI>Rome:</HI> where he &s;o plyed his &s;tudy, that you could hardly di&s;tingui&s;h who&s;e affection was greate&s;t, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ither his in Learning, or his Ma&s;ters in in&s;tructing him: and although he very well knew the greatne&s;s of his quality, yet however he e&s;teemed of no other greatne&s;s, but that which vertue &s;hould in&s;truct him in; in &s;uch manner, that he not only &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the hope which had been conceived of him: but he al&s;o a&s;toni&s;hed his Ma&s;ters, becau&s;e they could not reach him any thing but what he &s;oon learne with advantage. He was excellent in all the &s;even liberal Arts: for, fir&s;t he was a good Grammarian, by that means learning to &s;peak properly and correct|edly.

<PB N="5" REF="8"> as for Mu&s;ick he could by his voice, make an entire and perfect Harmony; In fine he learned by A&s;trology, not only the cour&s;e of the Stars, but al&s;o their influences, which foretel things to come: furthermore he had the knowledg of all things requi&s;ite to the perfection of man, in &s;uch manner that in ten years wherein he was under the tuition of the &s;even Phylo&s;ophers, he was not only a good Schollar, but &s;urpa&s;&s;ed in knowledg tho&s;e Ma&s;ters that had in&s;tructed him. Finally there did &s;hine in him all the good graces as well of Body, as of mind, for he abhorred all Vices, and on the contrary, exerci&s;ed all &s;orts of Vertue, pa&s;&s;ing his time in Di&s;putations with his Ma&s;ters: in which he took very much delight.

<P>Some time &s;ince, there lived a Gentleman in <HI>Rome</HI> having but one Son, who bring de&s;irous to have him well bred up as his only dear Child, cau&s;ed him to be nur&s;ed in the hou&s;e, and laid in his Chamber; the &s;ome Gentleman had a Dog which he had a very great e&s;teem for, as well for his hand&s;omene&s;s as good properties, and he took much plea&s;ure in him, as it was po&s;&s;ible for any Gentleman to take in &s;uch a creature. It happened that there was a Tourna|ment or running at Tilt, held in the publique Place in <HI>Rome;</HI> to which the Gentleman among&s;t others of his quality re&s;orted: And no &s;ooner was he gone but his wife al&s;o being as unadvi&s;ed as many other woman, had a mind to go &s;ee the plea&s;ures of this Tournement, and thereupon &s;he went with all her Chamber-maids and dam&s;ells; and to their great misfortune the Nur&s;e went to the Top of the hou&s;e, from whence although &s;he could not &s;ee, yet &s;he might hear what was done at the Tilting, having only &s;hut the Dog into the Chamber, where her Ma&s;ters Son lay: This Gentlemans hou&s;e being old and out of repair, there were many breeches in it even in the very room, where the Child and Dog were and that one of the&s;e holes, there at this time entered a great and horrible Serpent, which the dog
<PB N="43" REF="32"> &s;eeing, and that he made towards the Cradle, for the natural love which the&s;e Creatures bear to their Ma&s;ters, even to hazard their lives in their defence; he &s;lew upon the Serpent, to keep him from hurting the Child: But the one was not more furious in a&s;&s;aulting, then the other was in defending, and the Dog and Serpent &s;trugling together nere the Cradle where the Child lay they over turned it; &s;o that the Child fell to the ground, but without any harm, for the clothes that were upon were by the tumbling now underneath, and the Cradle &s;tanding on the four pomells, the Child lay as &s;afe and as well as it had done before it was overturned: the Dog being enraged as well at the wounds he had received of the Serpent, as at the wrong which he &s;aw was done to his young Ma&s;ter, threw him&s;elf with great fury upon the Serpent, who knew well enough how to defend him&s;elf; however in the end, the dog re|mained victorious and tore the Serpent in the cruel|e&s;t manner he could imagin, &s;o that he was all &s;meer|ed with his blood.</P>
<P>Hereupon the Nur&s;e coming into the Chamber to &s;ee how the Child did, &s;he had no &s;ooner put her foot within the door, but &s;eeing the Cra|dle top&s;ie turvy, and the Dog all bloody, with out looking any further, and being very cer|taine that he who had &s;aved the Childs life, had killed him; &s;he began to tear her Cloa|thes, and with outragious cryes went to entry this &s;ad news to the Childs Mother; who un|der&s;tanding of the death of her Child, fell into &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ion as any one would for do the lo&s;s of &s;uch a Child, and if the Nur&s;e expre&s;&s;ed her
<PB N="44" REF="33"> &s;orrow in tearing her cloaths, it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed that the poor Mother did not forbear doing the &s;ame to her fle&s;h; not only &s;he her &s;elf, but all the women of the hou&s;e who had accompanyed their Mi&s;tre&s;s, encrea&s;ed the lamentation, and made an in|credible noy&s;e with their great cryes and lamentati|ons, not any of them having the wit to go into the Chamber, and &s;ee how it had hapned: but there they continued their out-cryes until the Gentle-man returned from the Tourney, to whom they all with tears related, not that which they had &s;een, but that which they had imagined by the Nur&s;es di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The poor Father hearing the&s;e &s;ad tidings, more full of rage than tears, (for anger and &s;adne&s;s which are great pa&s;&s;ions had &s;topped his tears) went di|rectly into the Chamber, where meeting the Dog and &s;eeing him all bloody, gave ab&s;olute credit to what the woman had told him: and having his &s;word drawn in his hand, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;mote the Dog with &s;uch fury, that off went his head, and after he had &s;purned him with anger: he began to cur&s;e his fortune, and lament his Son, u&s;ing great threatnings towards his Wife and the other women of his hou&s;e, for the little care they had taken of his Child; and being in de&s;pair, he went towards the Cradle, which he took up to &s;ee if there were yet any parts of his Child whole, but he found him well, and without any hurt, whereupon all the Family were highly contented, as you may judge: and yet they were all a&s;toni&s;hed in that they had &s;een the Dog &s;o bloody, but as they &s;ought about the Chamber, they &s;aw the great Ser|pent which the Dog had tore to peices, whereupon they conjectured that the blood that was about the
<PB N="45" REF="33"> Dog, came by rea&s;on of the combate which he had with the Serpent, in defence of the Child; which the Gentleman &s;eeing, and being enraged that he had in anger kill'd his good Dog, he would have &s;lain his Wife, and all the other Women of the hou&s;e, who had been the cau&s;e of the Dogs death. Ah poor Dog &s;aid he, that thy friend-&s;hip and loyalty have been &s;o unfortunate to thee, to cau&s;e thy death in&s;tead of a recompence which thou did&s;t de&s;erve for &s;o well defending my little Child. In fine, this poor Gentle|man could not be appea&s;ed for the lo&s;s which he had cau&s;ed of &s;o faithful an annimal as his Dog was, &s;o that every one that hard it, had pitty and grief for the Childs lo&s;s, was now converted into grief for the lo&s;s of the Dog; all which &s;orrow hap|ned to this Gentle-man, for having given too much credit to his Wife, for if he had been wi&s;e, he would fir&s;t have examined the matter, and accordingly have judged it, without entring into &s;uch fury, as to act a thing which cau&s;ed perpetual &s;orrow to him with|out any remedy. I &s;hall conclude that this will be your ca&s;e, if you give credit to the words of a &s;im|ple woman, to put your Son to a Shameful death, who&s;e cau&s;e being heard de&s;erves rather prai&s;e than puni&s;hment and perpetual infamy; and therefore as your Maje&s;ties mo&s;t humble &s;ervant, I advi&s;e you that laying a&s;ide all anger before you proceed further, you cau&s;e this action of your &s;on to be con&s;ulted on, by wi&s;e &amp; experienc'd men, &s;uch as wil be faithful to you, &amp; that you will revoke this &s;entence, which your an|ger hath cau&s;ed you to pronounce. The Emperour took &s;uch notice of the Philo&s;ophers &s;aying, that he commanded &s;tay of the execution of the &s;entence,

<P>THE Emperour retireing when it was late, ac|cording to cu&s;tom found the Empre&s;s alone in her Chamber very di&s;con&s;olate; which much troub|led him, for he dearly loved her, and endeavour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d by all means to comfort her; but the more he e&s;&s;ay|ed, to plea&s;e her, &s;o much the more &s;he &s;obed, &s;o that the Emperour prayed her to be of good cheer, and that &s;he &s;hould be &s;atisfied: to which &s;he reply|ed, truly I have little cau&s;e to be contented, for the &s;hall care you take to revenge &s;o great an outrage, which hath not been committed again&s;t me only, but again&s;t your &s;elf; for upon this account you are as much injured as I am. It is true, I re&s;ent it more than you laying our honour more to heart than
<PB N="47" REF="34"> you, who however ought to &s;hew it more exempla|rily: as ye&s;terday you made me believe you did, but I know not who hath &s;o &s;uddenly cau&s;ed you to revoke your &s;entence, and I doubt to my great trouble, if you do not take more heed to your affairs, that it will happen to you, as it did to a very fair Pine-tree, which in&s;tead of being renew|ed, was cut up and de&s;troyed. What Pine was this &s;aid the Emperour, and what happned about it, to which the Empre&s;s an&s;wered. A while agoe there was a Gentleman of <HI>Italy,</HI> who had a very fair Garden, wherein he took &s;o much plea&s;ure, that he therein planted all &s;orts of Herbs, and Trees, and among others he had a very fair Pine, &s;o fair and &s;o &s;trait as any could be in the World, &s;o that this Gentle-man e&s;teemed this Pine more than all the Trees in the Garden, and thereupon he there made an arbour, taking great plea&s;ure to remain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nder the &s;haddow of it for the mo&s;t part of the day, whe|ther he had a mind to read, or otherwi&s;e to pa&s;s the time. It hapned as one often &s;ees among other Trees, that from the root of this Pine, &s;prung a &s;ucker, which the Gentle-man &s;eeing, being very much plea&s;ed at it, he commanded his Gardner to look carefully after it, hoping by this means to get an other Pine as fair as the former, and this young &s;ucker finding the fre&s;h Earth that was put about it, grew very well at the beginning, but being grown up &s;o high that the branches of the fir&s;t Pine kept the Sun from it: it did not grow &s;o well as at the fir&s;t, but became bent and crooked. The Gentle-man being troubled at it, asked the Gardner the cau&s;e, who an&s;wered, that the bowes of the great one,
<PB N="48" REF="35"> gave &s;o great a &s;haddow, that the young one not having the Sun and air to make it grow &s;trait up ac|cording to its Nature, it therefore was crooked and did not thrive, whereupon the Gentle-man com|manded to lop the old one, and take away the branches which hindered the Sun from the young one, &s;o the old one was lop'd all away on one &s;ide. It hapned that this Gentle-man had a voyage to make for &s;ome moneths; but before he went, he re|commended his young Pine to the Gardner above all things, in this the Gardner did not fail, &s;o that the Sun coming to the young one, it grew again as it had formerly done, but however it &s;till continued crooked; on the contrary, the great one began to wither on the &s;ide it had been lopped. The Gentle|man at his return, &s;eeing the great Pine half dead, and knowing that the&s;e two Pines hindred one ano|ther, and that there was little hopes of the great Pine, in regard it was &s;o decayed, cau&s;ed it to be cut up, and thus was this Tree (that had formerly been &s;o well beloved) de&s;troyed for the young Pines &s;ake; which although it grew to be a great one, yet it &s;till kept it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> ill and crooked &s;hape, which it had from the beginning: and thus will it happen to you, for having placed your Son, (if he may be called yours which <HI>I</HI> cannot believe) to the government of the&s;e &s;even Philo&s;ophers, you &s;ee in what ca&s;e he is, they have already lopt you on one &s;ide, by the &s;hame which they have cau&s;ed you, and which is wor&s;t, being re&s;olved to maintain and ju&s;tifie it; you will in &s;hort time &s;ee a rebellion in <HI>Rome,</HI> and if you &s;hould pardon him for this out-rage in hope<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> of his amendment, a&s;&s;ure your &s;elf that ere long he

<P>The people perceiving this, many of them ran with violence to the lodging of the Philo&s;ophers, and there they under&s;tood that they were gone, and had carried much of the Kings trea&s;ure with them; and then their &s;u&s;pition was cleered that all this ruin came by the only trea&s;on of the Philo&s;ophers; who being arrived at <HI>Cyprus</HI> were welcomed by King <HI>Nichoma|chus,</HI> who gave them much trea&s;ure in recompence of their good &s;ervice, whereby they had empoured him to be revenged on King <HI>Philarchus.</HI></P>

<P>Prince <HI>Entichus</HI> having fini&s;hed his &s;peech, which was dilligently ob&s;erved by the King who knew it was mode&s;t and rea&s;onable, he therefore con&s;ented thereto and gave him leave to depart accordingly fir&s;t furni&s;hing him with a &s;ufficient quantity of Money and Jewels; and now in &s;hort time he arriv|ed at the Court of the Emperour, who received him with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ll Immaginable kindne&s;s: And there he be|haved him&s;elf &s;o well, that the Emperour made him his Carver.

<P>In order to his cure the Emperor imployed all Phi|&s;itians that he could here of, &s;etting out Procla|mations, that if any could cure this di&s;temper, they &s;hould have a large reward; but when all was done they could do nothing, and &s;o they told him, that it was not within the cure of Phi&s;ick, and that if he were ever healed it mu&s;t be by miracle.

<P>Although the Emperor was joyful at his dear friends company, yet the Empre&s;s exceeded him in demon&s;tration of her joye; which the Emperor ob|&s;erving, he told her that he was well plea&s;ed there|with: wherefore &s;aid the Empre&s;s &s;hould I not ex|pre&s;s my joy to the heighth, for his company is more precious than all the Trea&s;ure in the World; for by his means you attained to this hono<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> and dignity, and he hath often hazarded his life to &s;ave yours.</P>

The Emperour hearing her con&s;tant &s;peech, was re&s;olved to make full tryal of her con|&s;tancy, and told her how all had hapned, and that her two Children were dead, &s;he bearing this, notwith|&s;tanding all her eouragious &s;peeches, yet Nature &s;o wrought with her that &s;he &s;unk down in a &s;woun, but remedies being u&s;ed &s;he recovered; at the newes of the Emperours Childrens death, the Nur&s;es went to &s;ee after them, when they came where they were, and expected to finde them dead, they &s;aw the contra|ry; for they were alive and &s;inging, and about their Necks where they were cut, were Circles of Gold; this joyful newes was brought to the Emperor and Empre&s;s, who were exceeding joyful thereat, give-thanks to Heaven for this Miracle.</P>

<P>And now the King being a &s;ingle man, that the&s;e two friends might be allyed by marriage as well as affection, the Emperour having one only Si&s;ter, gave her in Marriage to his Friend King <HI>Entichus</HI>

Thus affairs grow|ing every day better and better, it happened that in the Citty of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> which was his naturall Country, the great warrs, unfruitful &s;ea&s;ons, and o|ther bad influences had cau&s;ed &s;uch a Scarcity of Victuals, that the g eate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">t part of the inhabitants dyed with famine; &s;o that the inhabitants of <HI>Alexandria</HI> were nece&s;&s;itated to travel into &s;e|veral Countries to get Corn for the poor, and therefore they made choice of the mo&s;t expert and the mo&s;t knowing men that they could find among&s;t them (who willingly accepted of the Imployment, becau&s;e they were well provided with every thing) that from other parts they might relieve their Citizens, pa&s;&s;ing their time at the charge of others.

Whereupon having &s;ent for him, to come to his Pallace pretending to di&s;cour&s;e with him about other affairs, he cau|&s;ed him to &s;tay and Dine with him: which invi|tation he knowing not how to refu&s;e, accepeted of w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">th &s;uch honour and reverence, as hath been accu&s;to|med to be u&s;ed by tho&s;e who &s;peak with Kings, Prin|ces, and other great Lords.</P>
<P>Being at the Table, after that the King had &s;uf|ficiently informed him&s;elf of the e&s;tate of the City of <HI>Alexandria</HI> in generall, he que&s;tioned with his Father of his particular affairs, of his name, and how many Children he had?

<P>It may be &s;aid the King your Son is not dead, for there is one here pre&s;ent who hath e&s;caped from &s;uch a like misfortune as you &s;peak of and as he &s;aith he is the Son of a Merchant of the City of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and therefor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> advi&s;ed him to
