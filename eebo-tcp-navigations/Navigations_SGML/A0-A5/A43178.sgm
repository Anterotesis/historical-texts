<HEAD>O Brazeel: OR, <HI>The INCHANTED ISLAND.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_NEW Di&s;coveries of late, are as much admired as Miracles of old, and as difficultly believed, notwith&s;tanding the variety of apparent proofs which demon&s;trate their undoubted Verity; and without que&s;tion this Increduli|ty proceeds from no other cau&s;e, than the abu&s;e of Belief, occa&s;ioned by &s;uch mon&s;trous Fictions as the <HI>I&s;le of Pines, A New World in the Moon,</HI> with the like Lunatick Stories, by which the credulous World hath been mi&s;guided into a Faith wholly prepo&s;te|rou&s;ly erroneous and ridiculous.</P>
<P>That our pre&s;ent Di&s;cour&s;e of this New Di&s;co|very of <HI>O Brazeel,</HI> may not be &s;u&s;pected of the like lying Reports, it will be requi&s;ite to inquire whether there was, fir&s;t, ever any &s;uch place? and next, whether yet it hath a being?</P>
<PB N="2" REF="4">
<P>That there was an I&s;land called <HI>O Brazeel,</HI> I need not bring any other proofs or demon&s;trations to confirm that Opinion, than your own ob&s;ervations out of <HI>Strabo,</HI> and other ancient <HI>Geographers,</HI> in who&s;e Maps you may find both the I&s;land, its name, and &s;cituation; yet of late years it hath not been &s;een, for which cau&s;e, &s;ome imagine that being but a &s;mall tract of Land, it is either &s;wallow'd up by the Sea, or that the I&s;land is Inchanted. We have greater Rea&s;ons to believe the latter, if we con&s;ider the various Reports have been &s;pread abroad of late by &s;uch Sea-men, who by their &s;everal <HI>Affidavits</HI> have avouched they have &s;een this I&s;land, but could not reach it, by all the skill they had in <HI>Navigation.</HI> And I that which mo&s;t induced them to believe this mu&s;t be that I&s;le &s;o much talked of for its <HI>Inchant|ment,</HI> was, That it appeared in that part of the G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ean where they never &s;aw Land before, and over which they frequently have Sail'd.</P>
<P>I could in&s;tance &s;everal Reports of <HI>Fi&s;hermen,</HI> who at &s;everal times have &s;een it, but that I fear tho&s;e Relations will be look'd on as the <HI>Chimaera's</HI> of a <HI>junior Quixot,</HI> or fooli&s;h Fictions, unde&s;erving the Regi&s;try of a &s;erious and judicious memory, &s;ince they &s;eem to give <HI>Tom Coriat</HI> the Lye, and run away with the Whet&s;tone from our famous Knight|ly <HI>Mandevil.</HI></P>
<P>However I cannot let pa&s;s what I heard from &s;e|veral of the&s;e Di&s;coverers, who told me, they &s;aw this I&s;land (no blue Cloud, as I would have per&s;ua|ded
<PB N="3" REF="4">them to believe, but a long tract of firm Land) whereupon they bore up to it; yet notwith|&s;tanding they made all the Sail they could, in Ten hours Sail they &s;eem'd to be farther from it, than when fir&s;t it appeared to their view.</P>
<P>Another told me that he &s;aw it, and thereupon made up to it (hoping to be greater than ever that great U&s;urper <HI>Trinkelo,</HI> or at lea&s;t be Vice-Roy of this <HI>Inchanted I&s;land.</HI>) The Sky was &s;erene, the Sea &s;mooth, and hardly a breeze of wind &s;tirring, when he made this attempt, and therefore was extremely troubled he could make no better way. Whil'&s;t he was thus perplexing him&s;elf, the <HI>I&s;land</HI> &s;eem'd to float unto him with &s;uch celerity, that in a little time he could di&s;cover Rocks, Trees, and men of a prodigious &s;tature, who as they mov'd, look'd like walking Oaks, who&s;e &s;haggy bu&s;hy hair outvy'd the &s;preading of their leav'd branchy tops; and the waving of their hands, re&s;embled much the turning of our Wind-mills Sails. On the &s;hore, he &s;aw in|finite numbers of &s;eeming Bea&s;ts of &s;everal &s;hapes, and all &s;o dreadful and horrid to look on, that he could endure the &s;ight no longer; wherefore tack|ing, he &s;tood away in &s;uch di&s;traction, that he &s;carce|ly knew what he did: and that which contributed thereunto as much as his fear, he was immediately encompa&s;&s;ed with a Mi&s;t &s;o thick, he could not &s;ee his hand before him; yet could he &s;ee on the &s;ides of the Ve&s;&s;el, the Ma&s;ts and Yards, innumerable &s;mall lights, which &s;hifted their &s;tations, and interchanged
<PB N="4" REF="5">one with another, at length they all incorporated together, whence proceeded a great and unu&s;ual &s;la&s;h of Lightning, attended with dreadful claps of Thunder; after which, the Air grew clear, and &s;e|rene again, but could not di&s;cover the lea&s;t mark of what he had &s;een before.</P>
<P>A Third gave me this Account of the <HI>I&s;land:</HI> That being one day abroad a fi&s;hing, he di&s;covered Land where he never &s;aw any before; and re&s;olving to run the &s;ame hazard his Brethren had done be|fore, he made up to it: coming within Musket-&s;hot, as he imagin'd, he was &s;aluted with &s;uch a Broad|&s;ide of Thunder, &s;econded with Lightning, and &s;uch a tumbling Sea, that had he not made all the Sail he could homeward, he had undoubtedly &s;lept in <HI>Da|vid Jones</HI> his Locker. In his return, he found the Needle of his Compa&s;s u&s;ele&s;s, whereupon he try'd another, and found that the like; and therefore it was needle&s;s to apply him&s;elf to either.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Report I &s;hall give you, is thus: A Ve&s;|&s;el being bound for the We&s;tward, and coming un|der the &s;ame Latitude where this <HI>Inchanted I&s;land</HI> is &s;aid to be &s;cituate, &s;he was &s;uddenly &s;urprized, and involved in a Mi&s;t, yet &s;tood under a very &s;tiff gale; whereupon &s;he endeavour'd to lie by, but could not, for &s;he would not an&s;wer to her Helm. Whil&s;t the men were cha&s;ing and cur&s;ing, one in&s;tantly cry|ed out, <HI>Land! Land! Helm-a-lee, for the love of God.</HI> The Ma&s;ter being alarm'd at this dreadful noi&s;e, look'd out, and &s;aw huge high Rocks ju&s;t up|on
<PB N="5" REF="5">his very Bowe; whereupon crying out &s;udden|ly to Heaven for mercy, tho&s;e Rocks and Land ad|joyning immediately, &s;eem'd to drop a Curt&s;ie un|der water, and the Ma&s;ter thought the Ve&s;&s;el &s;ail'd clear over them. The&s;e &s;trange and &s;eeming in|credible Reports, made me very inqui&s;itive after the truth thereof; and in all my inquiries I found the Relations of others &s;o agreeable to the former, that they only differ'd in &s;ome few circum&s;tances: from them all I gather'd what was mo&s;t probable, and made a report thereof to &s;ome ingenious men of my acquaintance, who at fir&s;t &s;miled at my fond Credulity, and blamed my over-forward faith in believing a company of ignorant Fellows, who had neither rea&s;on, nor &s;en&s;e enough to di&s;tingui&s;h a blue Cloud from Land, which afar off looketh of the &s;ame complexion by rea&s;on of its di&s;tance; and endeavoured to jeer me out of my opinion, by tel|ling me it was as ridiculous as to think there are multiplicity of Worlds, or that one wherein we live, had its matter and form from a confu&s;ed con|flux of Atoms; however, I could not be di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;t of my per&s;ua&s;ion, but per&s;i&s;ted therein, till I was farther confirmed by a Dream, wherein I thought I had a view of the whole I&s;le, and its Inhabitants; and thus it was:</P>
<P><HI>My brain not any wayes di&s;turb'd by Fumes pro|ceeding from an over-running Cup, which are cau&s;es of phanta&s;tick Dreams, I fell a&s;leep in a Summers
<PB N="6" REF="6" MS="y">afternoon, and dream'd I &s;aw an Eagle unnaturally great, &s;oaring in the Air; whil&s;t I was wondring at his greatne&s;s, he immediately &s;toopt, and took, me up within his tallons, and flew away with me with in|credible celerity over Mountains and Vallies, and at length brought me to the Sea-&s;ide: where having re&s;ted a little while, he took me up again, and car|ried me to an I&s;land; and having &s;et me down, vani&s;ht.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I was &s;irangely amaz'd hereat, not knowing what to do, till at length a per&s;on of a lovely pre&s;ence. With an Angelical countenance, appear'd to me advi|&s;ing me to be of good courage, and follow him; which I did accordingly; but in our way we were ob&s;truct|ed by millions of Devils, and horrid Spectrums, who&s;e &s;hapes and forms were &s;o afrightful, that had it not been for my Guide, I &s;hould not have been able to have &s;tirred a foot forward; but by his encou|ragement I went on, and &s;aw other very &s;trange ap|paritions, &s;uch as would have &s;tartled the mo&s;t un|daunted he that wears a head. My Guide having di&s;&s;ipated the&s;e, as well as the former, brought me at la&s;t unto a place which for &s;oil and temperature of Air might vye with any place in Chri&s;tendom; here I gave my greedy eyes full liberty to fea&s;t on all the delicates Nature is capable to produce, which are too many here to numerate. The verdant Fields, and plea&s;ant Groves, were not to be parallel'd; but no &s;ign where any Corn was &s;own: whatever grew, came up &s;pontaneou&s;ly, without the labour of the hands. I
<PB N="7" REF="6" MS="y">wondred that I &s;aw no Hou&s;es, nor People to inhabit them in &s;uch a Paradi&s;e as this: whil&s;t my eyes were bu&s;ily inquiring into the excellency of &s;uch ob|jects as pre&s;ented them&s;elves to my view, I &s;aw Men, Women and Children a&s;cend out of the bowels of the earth (as I thought) who were all naked, very white, and well-featur'd, who all fell down, and &s;eem'd to wor&s;hip a deformed ill-&s;hapen thing, which I judged was the Devil; hereupon I ask't my Guide the mean|ing hereof, who with an au&s;tere countenance told me,</HI> That the I&s;le was under the power of the Prince of the Air, and had been &s;o for many years; but the time is near at hand it &s;hall be &s;o no longer. <HI>The words were no &s;ooner &s;poken, but there followed &s;uch loud peals of Thunder, as if the foundation of the earth had been torn a&s;under, accompanied with &s;uch Lightning &s;eemingly to me, as if the element of Fire had been placed in the lower Region: the&s;e hor|rours were accompanied with &s;uch di&s;mal &s;ounds, that nothing el&s;e could better repre&s;ent an infernal con&s;ort: this continued but a very little, and then the Horizon grew as &s;plendent as before, without the least di&s;turbance. Whil&s;t I was in my greate&s;t amaze|ment, not knowing what to think or do, my Guide vani&s;h't, and the former Eagle took me up in his tallons, and carried me the &s;ame way back again; and having brought me to my habitation, left me, and then I awak't.</HI></P>
<PB N="8" REF="7" MS="y">
<P>Then did I ponder with my &s;elf what this Dream &s;hould &s;ignifie: after various con&s;iderations, I con|cluded this mu&s;t be <HI>O Brazeel,</HI> and that I was the man mu&s;t be its happy Di&s;coverer. There wanted not Arguments to flatter my &s;elf into this opinion; and being over-joy'd, I in&s;tantly ran to a Friend to tell him my Dream, and how well it &s;uited with the former Reports concerning this <HI>Inchanted I&s;land:</HI> this man did pre&s;ently put great confidence in my Dream, and readily con&s;ented not only to be a&s;&s;i&s;t|ant in this new di&s;covery, but likewi&s;e to go him|&s;elf in per&s;on, having at that time a Ve&s;&s;el of his own of about Thirty Tuns ready fitted.</P>
<P>No man could be fitter for this purpo&s;e than he and I: for we were both &s;o <HI>indebted</HI> to the place wherein we were, that we only wanted a wind to Sell the Countrey. Having concluded on the de&s;ign, we made no delayes, but getting Seamen aboard be|fitting our purpo&s;e, on <HI>October</HI> the <HI>9th,</HI> 1672. we &s;et Sail, bearing our cour&s;e due We&s;t, &s;ometimes We&s;t and by South, and &s;ometimes We&s;t-North-We&s;t, each traver&s;e not exceeding Fifteen Leagues in Longitude. We thus continued doing about &s;even dayes: on the eighth day in the morning, we e&s;pyed a blue Cloud at We&s;t-South-We&s;t; the &s;ight hereof overjoy'd only the Ma&s;ter, and my &s;elf (for there was none of the Seamen privy to our de&s;ign;) and that we might the &s;ooner enjoy the fruits of our longing expectations, we made all the Sail we could up to it: the nearer our approach, the
<PB N="9" REF="7" MS="y">blacker it grew; and having Sail'd towards it about half a watch, it vani&s;ht in an extraordinary fla&s;h of Lightning.</P>
<P>Being troubled to be thus di&s;appointed, we alter'd our cour&s;e, and &s;tood away to the Northward till the next Morning, lying by all the Night. In the Morning we tackt, and &s;tood to the Southward, and towards the Evening we had &s;ight of it again, and in the Morning we &s;eem'd to be very near it, and, as we thought, &s;aw Ships riding at Anchor.</P>
<P>Now did we verily believe this mu&s;t be <HI>O Bra|zeel;</HI> and whil'&s;t the Ma&s;ter and I were contending who &s;hould be the <HI>Vice-Roy,</HI> or have mo&s;t power and authority therein, the Wind ro&s;e high, and the Sea began to skud again&s;t it, the Sky was overca&s;t, and the Elements &s;eemed to contend which &s;hould perform fir&s;t the part of a mercile&s;s Executioner.</P>
<P>Certainly <HI>Neptune</HI> at this time wanted &s;ome pa&s;time, and was re&s;olved to play at <HI>Tennis,</HI> bandy|ing us to and fro like Balls, making u&s;e of his Bil|lows for his Rackets. Thus were we to&s;t up and down two Dayes and Nights at lea&s;t; which &s;o di&s;|compo&s;ed my Body (being unaccu&s;tomed to &s;uch labour, and continual watching) that I was forced to go into my Cabin; and though I was &s;en&s;ible of imminent danger, yet my wearied body could no longer hold out. Ju&s;t as I was rockt into a &s;lumber, in came the Ma&s;ter with more &s;peed than ordinary, being quickned (as any might imagine by his coun|tenance) with the &s;en&s;e and apprehen&s;ion of &s;ome
<PB N="10" REF="8" MS="y">&s;udden en&s;uing danger; had he gone about to con|ceal his fears, he could not have done it, they were written &s;o legible in his face in the characters of hor|rour and amazement: which made me ask him, <HI>Whether all was well?</HI> he tremblingly, yet churli&s;h|ly told me, <HI>I might &s;leep on, for 'twas like to be my last.</HI> With that I leapt out, and coming on the Deck, I &s;aw a Fellow at his prayers, who never &s;aid them, but when he thought he &s;hould as certainly dye, as be drunk when he came a&s;hore: never did frightful Gho&s;t &s;tartle poor timerous Mortals more, than the devout po&s;ture of that Fellow did me, knowing it an infallible &s;ymptom or forerunner of immediate ruine and de&s;truction. In this di&s;mal and fatal Exigency, I could hardly forbear &s;miling, (though &s;ince I have condemn'd my Vanity in that condition) to &s;ee a Fellow wringing of his hands, who had a No&s;e &s;ome dayes before as red as any blood; which blood was now &s;o chill'd and con|geal'd by fear, that it lookt like the end of a half|boil'd Black-pudding.</P>
<P>But to be &s;erious, I made a diligent inquiry what &s;hould be the cau&s;e of their di&s;order'd and di&s;tract|ed looks? I was an&s;wer'd by a File of Deaths-heads, That our Ve&s;&s;el had &s;prung a Leak, and that there was no hope of &s;afety. You may imagine what a &s;trange <HI>Metamorpho&s;is</HI> the&s;e deadly words made in my face; however, I pre&s;ently be&s;tir'd my &s;elf, and thought it requi&s;ite to u&s;e a helping hand, as well as a tongue, to cry <HI>God help.</HI> By my example, the re&s;t
<PB N="11" REF="8">fell to work, who were bu&s;ie in doing nothing, and knew nothing what they did. I de&s;ired the Ma&s;ter to go down into the Hold, to find out the Leak our Ship had &s;prung; who in&s;tantly re|turn'd, and told me, That the Leak was both in|&s;crutable, and incurable; for the water flow'd in &s;o fa&s;t, that we mu&s;t now number our dayes by one &s;ingle minute. I never heard a Deaths-head &s;peak before; and the Truth of it is, he lookt much more like Death him&s;elf, than his Me&s;&s;enger: had he &s;aid not a word, we might have read our ruine in his countenance.</P>
<P>There was now nothing more to be done, than to hoi&s;t our Boat over-board; which was as &s;oon done, as commanded, and every one &s;trove who &s;hould leap into it fir&s;t; I was the &s;econd, and having taken in four more, we put off from the Ship-&s;ide, fearing le&s;t the &s;inking Ship &s;hould draw us in after it.</P>
<P>Now did we Rowe we knew not whither, in a Sea which &s;eldom wears a &s;mooth brow in Autumn, which at this time contending with the Wind, &s;well'd into prodigious Mountains, which threatned every moment to be our Monu|ments.</P>
<P>And that which aggravated our Mi&s;ery, we had no &s;ight of Land in an open Boat, no Compa&s;s to guide, no Provi&s;ion to &s;u&s;tain us; and the Night growing on upon us, no|thing could pre&s;erve us, but a Miracle: and
<PB N="12" REF="9" MS="y">though the waves carried us up to Heaven, yet there was no ground for our hope or belief, that God &s;hould put his hand out of a Cloud, and take us mi&s;erable Mortals to him&s;elf from the top of a &s;urging wave; neither could we expect to meet any &s;hip; for though many &s;hips come from the &s;ame place, and bound for the &s;ame Haven, yet they &s;el|dom meet in the va&s;t Ocean, and Sail in the &s;ame Line; there are no beaten paths in the floods, no High-wayes and common Roads in the Sea.</P>
<P>Yet &s;uch was our good fortune, that we e&s;pied a Sail making towards us, and we what we could to|wards it; but having but two Oars, we were not able to break the waves, and therefore made but lit|tle way.</P>
<P>And now De&s;pair &s;eized us again; for notwith|&s;tanding all our endeavours, we could not reach this Ve&s;&s;el, nor the Ve&s;&s;el us: and now indeed I could not forbear &s;hedding tears, although I had no need of more &s;alt water.</P>
<P>This our pregnant hopes brought forth nothing but wind and water; and we that before, at the &s;ight of this &s;hip, flatter'd our &s;elves with the a&s;&s;u|rance of &s;afety, were now as much confounded with a certainty of peri&s;hing. For my part, I judg'd it a le&s;s affliction to have had no hopes at all of a deliverance, than pre&s;ently to fall from it. Que&s;tion|le&s;s it did redouble the puni&s;hment of <HI>Tantalus,</HI> to ki&s;s tho&s;e Apples with his lips, which he mu&s;t not ta&s;te with his tongue.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="9" MS="y">
<P>But again we entertained fre&s;h hopes: for in this our black and di&s;mal Night, we e&s;pied a light, which pre&s;ently we Row'd to with all might and main; the &s;hip &s;tanding towards us with more wind than her Sails could well bear, came up quickly with us: we crying all out, She hung on the Lee, and we came aboard of her; we were entertained ci|villy by the Ma&s;ter of the Ve&s;&s;el, and his men, whom we under&s;tood by an <HI>Engli&s;h man</HI> on board, were <HI>Walli&s;ians,</HI> and were bound for <HI>Montecapernia.</HI></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding we e&s;caped &s;o miraculou&s;ly, and had &s;uch good entertainment from Strangers (when all hopes were lo&s;t) yet our dejected coun|tenances &s;ufficiently declared the di&s;content of our minds, and de&s;iring to be comforted as <HI>Job</HI> was af|ter our lo&s;&s;es, with twice as much as we had be|fore.</P>
<P>The next Morning the wind &s;omewhat &s;lackned, and the Sea was le&s;s turbulent; but towards Night, it blew fre&s;her than it did from the time of our Shipwrack.</P>
<P>The day being &s;hut in, and the Ma&s;ter knowing he was not far from Land, was at his wits ends, being none of the be&s;t Seaman; and whil'&s;t I was reading his fears in the confu&s;ion of his countenance, and thinking to advi&s;e him for the be&s;t, the Ship &s;truck again&s;t a clefted Rock &s;o violently, that there &s;he &s;tuck, till we had all the opportunity of leaping out; but by rea&s;on of the darkne&s;s of the Night, the Ma&s;ter knew not where he was.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="10" MS="y">
<P>With longing expectation to &s;ee the Morning|&s;tar draw the Curtain of the Night, we roved to and fro, and found &s;till firm footing on a &s;pacious Rock; but as yet we had not light enough to di&s;|cover us fir&s;t to our &s;elves (being as yet in the dark) as ignorant of our &s;elves, as deplorable condition.</P>
<P>Never did Night &s;eem longer to any Mortal, than this to me; for be&s;ides that I was thinly clad, having ca&s;t off my Coat, intending to &s;wim, and had not lei&s;ure to put it on again, thinking it better to leave that behind, than my &s;elf; I &s;ay, I had lo&s;t my &s;hooes: &s;o that though I was often up to the calf of the Legs (as I rambled up and down in the dark) yet I could not &s;ay I was over &s;hooes.</P>
<P>And now the long-expected morning drew near, and we fain would have &s;een before we could. In that twilight, every black Cloud we di&s;cern'd, we flattered our &s;elves was &s;ome Town, or Village; but when the Sun aro&s;e, we found our &s;elves on a Rock, which was an I&s;land when our Ship &s;plit upon it; but the Sea ebbing, left us a dry pa&s;&s;age to the &s;hore, which was about Musket-&s;hot di&s;tant.</P>

<P>This <HI>Walli&s;ian</HI> Skipper (who had &s;o much com|pa&s;&s;ion as to take us into his Ve&s;&s;el) had &s;o much good nature to conduct us to a Hou&s;e he knew, which was the Par&s;on's of a neighbouring Village, by whom we were welcomed. Having dryed, and refre&s;hed our&s;elves, we fell into &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e with Mr. Par&s;on, and his Wife; and though they &s;pake but little <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> yet they indifferently under&s;tood the &s;aid Iliads of our misfortunes, which they expre&s;t by their tears, weeping bitterly at our relation, &s;o that one would have thought they had &s;uffered Shipwrack, and not we. What meat they had, they did &s;et before us; and we fell to it &s;o heartily, as if we would have repaired all we lo&s;t before by our long fa&s;ting, at one meal.</P>
<P>Their Bread was broad Oat-cakes baked on a flat &s;tone, made of &s;tuff much like that which the <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> call <HI>Haver-meal;</HI> but their Beer is very &s;trong, which they brew on purpo&s;e, as I imagine, to verifie the Proverb, <HI>Good Drink, is Meat, Drink, and Cloth:</HI> for in the colde&s;t &s;ea&s;on they will go bare-foot, and be clad very thin; but they will be &s;ure to keep their under&s;tandings warm, and line their in&s;ides well with their potent Liquor.</P>
<P>The next day, the Par&s;on to expre&s;s his kind|ne&s;s in a more liberal manner, de&s;ired us all to Dine with him: we had but one Di&s;h for enter|tainment, and that &s;o cram'd with &s;uch variety of Gods Creatures, that this Di&s;h &s;eem'd to me to be the fir&s;t Chapter of <HI>Gene&s;is;</HI> there was

But when I under&s;tood that this hodge|podge proceeded more from Cu&s;tom, than Curio&s;i|ty; and that this was one point of their good hu&s;|bandry, to boyle all together to &s;ave charges, my former Cen&s;ure was &s;omewhat mitigated.</P>
<P>The Par&s;on took &s;o great a liking to me, that he would not be denied, but that I &s;hould &s;tay with him one Month; to which, with much intreaty, I con&s;ented: the re&s;t of the company took &s;uch cour|&s;es as were mo&s;t convenient for their pre&s;ent con|dition. In this time he brought me acquainted with many Gentlemen of this Countrey, one whereof &s;o prevailed with me, as to live with him two years; in which time, I took the&s;e true en&s;uing ob&s;ervations of the Countrey: if they are not &s;o large and full as expected, let my &s;mall &s;tay in that place make my Apology.</P>

<P><HI>Montecapernia</HI> to the Southward, is a Countrey inricht with Natures chiefe&s;t Trea&s;ures; the fruitful|ne&s;s of who&s;e Soil may vye with mo&s;t places of the Univer&s;e.</P>
<P>Their Hills for height are dreadful to the eye; and although they &s;eem almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible, yet are very profitable to the Inhabitants, not only as to the Mines of Coals, Lead, and Silver, contain'd within the bowels of the&s;e Mountains, but al&s;o to the good Common they afford to va&s;t numbers of Sheep, which are but &s;mall, yet very &s;weet Mutton, who&s;e fleece employs many hands in that Countrey; which plentifully &s;upplies many more near adja|cent, with good &s;erviccable Cloth, Frize, Flannel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Neither is the Northward of this Countrey &s;o barren, but that the Land produceth what is nece&s;|&s;ary for the &s;u&s;tenance, profit, and plea&s;ure of the Inhabitants. Their Bea&s;ts in general are but &s;mall, yet &s;uch (as are for food) much more indulge the palate, than any fle&s;h in other parts; what are for labour, are very &s;erviceable, being full of mettle, exceeding hardy, and will carry Burdens, the
<PB N="23" REF="15" MS="y">greatne&s;s whereof would &s;tartle any mans be|lief.</P>
<P>The Countrey is water'd by many excellent Ri|vers and Rivulets, which are furni&s;hed with great numbers of variety of Fi&s;h; one &s;ort whereof I took &s;pecial notice of, having never &s;een the like before; the Natives call it a <HI>Mort,</HI> they are of all &s;izes, &s;peckled with red &s;pots on the &s;ide, &s;ome whereof are as big as a <HI>Salmon,</HI> and eat exactly like it.</P>
<P>Their Seas round about &s;upply them with all manner of Shell-fi&s;h, and other &s;orts, the choice&s;t which ever came to <HI>Neptunes</HI> Table; which they convey to other Countries circumjacent, and there|by make a very great advantage.</P>
<P>Their Mar&s;hes and Rivers (of which they have plenty) are vi&s;ited by multitudes of Wild-fowl in the Winter-&s;ea&s;on; their Hills are &s;tor'd with Wood|cock, Grou&s;t, Heath-cock, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Nor are they a little &s;tored with Red-deer, Hares, and Rab|bits.</P>
<P>Fi&s;h and Fle&s;h of all &s;orts are &s;old cheaper than can be imagin'd; as a Quarter of Mutton for Eight pence, an Ell-long Salmon for Ten pence, a Pullet for a Groat, and in &s;ome places (accor|ding to the &s;ea&s;on) Twenty Eggs a penny. I know not whether this cheapne&s;s may ari&s;e from the plenty of the afore&s;aid provi&s;ion, or the &s;carci|ty of money.</P>
<PB N="24" REF="16" MS="y">
<P>The People in general are great admirers of their Pedigree, and have got their Genealogy &s;o exactly by heart, that though it be two hours work for them to repeat the names only from whence they are de|&s;cended lineally, yet will they not omit one word in half a dozen &s;everal Repetitions; from whence I gather, they &s;ay them in&s;tead of their <HI>Pater no&s;ter,</HI> or their Evening and their Morning Pray|ers.</P>
<P>The Gentry (for the mo&s;t part) are extracted from very ancient Families, who are adored by the Commonalty; and to give them their due, are good natur'd Gentlemen, exceeding free, and cour|teous to &s;trangers, and extraordinary generous in their entertainments; in&s;omuch that I have &s;een in a Gentlemans hou&s;e of indifferent e&s;tate, at a mode|rate Treat, Twenty Di&s;hes, many of them treb|ly jointed, to recompence the &s;mallne&s;s of the meat.</P>
<P>Their want of Wine is &s;upply'd by mo&s;t incom|parable Beer and Ale, which runs as free as Water on a vi&s;it; and if you do not drink as freely, they think they have not made you welcome; &s;o that a man knows not how to take leave, till he is unable to &s;tir a foot.</P>
<P>They are very courteous in their Speech, and no|ble in their Carriage, firm (where they take) and con&s;tant in their Re&s;olutions, &s;plendid in their pub|lick Ceremonies (of Shrievalry, and the like) cou|ragious, &s;tout, and great lovers of their Prince and
<PB N="25" REF="16" MS="y">Countrey; honourable in their Inclinations, and re&s;olute in their Enterprizes. In &s;hort, they are ge|nerally accompli&s;ht in mo&s;t re&s;pects, and greatly gi|ven to that they call Ho&s;pitality.</P>
<P>As I have thus Characteriz'd the good, &s;o take the bad with it, according to my ob&s;ervation, du|ring my abode in this Countrey: the pure&s;t Wheat will have its Chaff, and there is no Wine but hath &s;ome Lees.</P>
<P>Travelling into &s;ome places of no mean extent, I thought my &s;elf to be at the Fag-end, or A&mdash;of the World; the Land being &s;o exceeding barren, and de&s;titute of Wood, that for Ten or Twenty miles together (cro&s;s the Countrey) you could not &s;ee a Bu&s;h to tye your Hor&s;e to, till you have untru&s;t a point; and therefore you mu&s;t either bridle your mouth to &s;tay your Hor&s;e, or tru&s;t to the tame na|ture, and good conditions of the Bea&s;t; who if he be inclin'd to cool his mouth with a tuft of gra&s;s, he may &s;ooner find it in a Feather-bed; but if the quickne&s;s of the Air hath given him an appe|tite to eat, and a Stomack to dige&s;t Heath, Mo&s;s, and &s;cragged Stones, he cannot want Provi|&s;ion.</P>
<P>The People in the&s;e barren places have &s;o little conver&s;e with Travellers, and the paths are &s;o un|trodden, that a man mu&s;t aim at the way by gue&s;s, or carry a Compa&s;s with him: and yet he may ea&s;i|ly mi&s;take the mo&s;t noted Road; which if he do, he had need have recour&s;e to his devotion for his
<PB N="26" REF="17" MS="y">miraculous deliverance from riding Twenty-four hours, and never the nearer his Journies end; nay, it may be not &s;ix Miles di&s;tant from whence he &s;tray'd, and in all his Travels &s;ee nothing but a flock of Gee&s;e, &s;ome &s;cattered Sheep, half a dozen rag|ged Colts, and now and then a few Crows flying over his head, unle&s;s by chance under the &s;ide of &s;ome Hill (if near a common Road) he di&s;covers a Smoke, which if he make towards (and happily e&s;cape a Bogg (of which the Hills afford great plenty, and very dangerous too) yet will it be dif|ficult to di&s;cern the &s;tately Man&s;ion whence the Smoke aro&s;e, till his Hor&s;es feet be very near the roof; &s;uch is the Natives care in &s;heltring them&s;elves within the Walls of Nature: And upon this ac|count, I have heard &s;everal of them brag of the &s;trength and &s;trange &s;cituation of their Towns, one whereof I had de&s;cribed to me, which engaged my Curio&s;ity to &s;ee it; whence I took this ob&s;erva|tion.</P>
<P>It is &s;cituated in a little Vale, encompa&s;&s;ed round with Walls, which are a Mile thick, and more; the entrance into the Town is under water, and the Steeple belonging to the Town, grows every years.</P>
<P>This place lies to the Norward of <HI>Montecaper|nia;</HI> and though it be contemptible for its build|ings; yet is often made the place for the General A&s;|&s;ize of that County, where the Ju&s;tices of <HI>Oyer</HI> and <HI>Terminer</HI> &s;it: where note, that this Countrey is
<PB N="27" REF="17" MS="y">governed by as whole&s;om Laws as any other Coun|trey. Now to unriddle the afore&s;aid de&s;cription, the Town is built in a Hole, encompa&s;&s;ed with very great and high Hills, which meet in their tops al|mo&s;t at the entrance into Town, by which means there is a Trough made over the pa&s;&s;age from one Hill to the other, for a conveyance of a watry Brook, which otherwi&s;e would annoy the pa&s;&s;age into Town: under this Trough the People travel, which is their going under water into Town: as for the Steeple, they have none, but the Bell hangs in an Yew-Tree in the Church-yard; and there lies the quibble, that the Steeple grows every year.</P>
<P>They boa&s;t of other &s;trange things they have in their Countrey, namely, a great Green Bridge two or three Miles in length, on which (like that un|der which the River <HI>Anus</HI> runs in <HI>Spain</HI>) they can feed Two or three hundred Head of Cattle. It &s;eems there is a River in this Countrey that runs &s;ome Miles under-ground, and di&s;imbogues it &s;elf into the Sea; the Inhabitants report, if a Goo&s;e &s;hould be put into this River, and &s;he &s;wim through this earthen Bridge, &s;he will come out with never a feather on her back; the cau&s;e to me is occult and hidden.</P>
<P>There is another place far within the Land, through which, at high-water, the Sea will da&s;h up a con&s;iderable height, with a noi&s;e both horrible and hideous; this is occa&s;ioned by the concav'd Earth, giving an inlet to the Sea.</P>
<PB N="28" REF="18" MS="y">
<P>They talk of a Well al&s;o they have, in which there is Thirty &s;teps to de&s;cend into it; in the &s;tony &s;ide whereof, there is the exact impre&s;&s;ion of a man, which they &s;ay was Chri&s;t (by which you may ga|ther the <HI>Montecapernians</HI> have heard of our Savi|our:) this impre&s;&s;ion was occa&s;ioned, as they &s;ay, when our Saviour de&s;cending this Well to drink, he lean'd again&s;t the Wall, which was &s;o tender-na|tur'd as to yield to his &s;ides and limbs, le&s;t its hard|ne&s;s &s;hould hurt any of them.</P>
<P>Though the&s;e things may &s;eem incredible, yet I can a&s;&s;ure this, that they will talk to one another above Two miles di&s;tant; that is, one &s;hall &s;tand on the top of one high Hill, and the other upon the other: And though their tops are near, yet in the de&s;cending of one, and a&s;cending the other Hill, reckoning the interval between, and it will not amount to le&s;s than two Miles: this they will brag of too; and to &s;hew their wit, will tell you pretty &s;tories; as for example, that two Fathers, and two Sons, kill'd three Hares, and each carried home one, and no more; that is, there was Grandfather, Fa|ther and Son: And to amu&s;e you, will tell you, that one of their Countreymen caught a <HI>Fox,</HI> a <HI>Salmon,</HI> and a <HI>Phea&s;ant</HI> at one draught in a Net; that is, the Net was laid for the <HI>Phea&s;ant,</HI> in a &s;mall Wood near the Sea-&s;ide, where was a Wyer in which was a <HI>Sal|mon,</HI> which the <HI>Fox</HI> getting, ran with it into the Wood, and &s;o into the Net, ju&s;t as he was drawing for the <HI>Phea&s;ant,</HI> and &s;o caught them all three.</P>
<PB N="29" REF="18" MS="y">
<P>The <HI>Montecapernian</HI> Cots are generally built on the &s;ide of a Hill, not to be di&s;cerned till you ju&s;t come upon them.

If for nothing el&s;e, but for their taking the Sacrament, you may know they are no Heathens.</P>
<P>The Hearth is placed in the middle of the hou&s;e, and their Fuel is made of Earth and Cow-dung dry|ed in the Sun; the Smoke goes through no particu|lar place, but breaks through every part between the Rods or Wattles of which they make their Doors, &s;ides, and Roof of the hou&s;e, which commonly is no bigger than an overgrown Pig-&s;tye; to which they have two Doors, one alwayes &s;hut on that &s;ide where the wind blows; from whence I believe it is, that they brag they have the quicke&s;t Arenitects in all the world, becau&s;e they can build a hou&s;e in a day.</P>

<P>They delight not in variety of Rooms, hating Three Stories, as a Zealot does the Triple-Crown; and that they may have all their Family about them inclo&s;ed in one Room, the Good-man and his Wife have their Bed rai&s;ed up about half as high as the Roof, which is the Tea&s;ter to their Bed, made of Straw or Ru&s;hes, according to cold or warmer wea|ther. The Sheets are the Womans Smock, which (if &s;he be a good Hou&s;ewife) &s;hall contain her &s;maller Children on the one &s;ide, and her Husband on the other, when clo&s;ed up; and he peeping out at her bo&s;om, you would take it to be an Hermaphro|ditical Mon&s;ter, big with Child, and ready to be de|livered.</P>
<P>They get into this Bed by a &s;tone or two &s;et by the &s;ide: the Man and Wife lie at one end, and what Children they have (Boyes and Girles) lie at the other, their feet meeting all together <HI>higgle-de-pig|gle-dee.</HI> The re&s;t of the Family they di&s;po&s;e of thus: a Goat or an Ewe they tye to the Beds-feet; over their heads Roo&s;t their Cocks and Hens, and now and then &s;hew the nature of their name, foul the foul faces of their Ma&s;ter and Dame; this Dung likewi&s;e &s;erves in&s;tead of Soap when they have oc|ca&s;ion to wa&s;h, which is but &s;eldom, having nothing be&s;ides their Cloaths to wear, but a Neck-cloth, and a Flannel Smock.</P>
<PB N="31" REF="19" MS="y">
<P>Their general Food is a thin Oat-cake, which they bake upon a broad flat &s;tone made hot, a lit|tle Sheeps-milk Chee&s;e, or Goats-milk, boyl'd Leeks, and &s;ome Roots; but &s;eldom eat fle&s;h, or drink &s;trong Beer, but at Fairs, and Publick Solemnities: and then it is pity, for at any time Small-beer will &s;et their Heads afloat, and their Tongues into a per|petual motion, talk of nothing but Pedigrees, grow quarrel&s;om, fight with their own Heels, and may be lo&s;e their &s;tockings and &s;hooes before they get home, which el&s;e might la&s;t them an Age, in regard they never wear them, but carry them on their backs, going bare-foot, till they come near a Market-Town, where Men and Women alike, with an inch-Pipe fil|led with Pigs-tail, or Mundungus Tobacco, and a great Turf of fire to light it, &s;it down on the ground, and put on their Stockings and Shooes to go in, and at their return, at the &s;ame place, pull them off again; being more afraid to scratch their Shooes, than cut their Feet and Toes: who&s;e skin is &s;o hardned, that Men, Women and Children, in the mid&s;t of Winter, go Bare-foot on &s;harp Stones, pie|ces of Ice, edge or &s;ide, all alike to them; for which rea&s;on there are few Shoocmakers in the Coun|trey, becau&s;e commonly their Shooes la&s;t them an Age.</P>
<P>At other times, their Drink is either three parts Water, and a fourth Milk, which they call <HI>Gla&s;tor,</HI> or a handful of Crabs brui&s;ed and laid a&s;oak in a Bowl-full of running Water, for two or three hours.
<PB N="32" REF="20" MS="y">They have another &s;ort of Drink called <HI>Whigg,</HI> which is a kind of a &s;our Whey. Likewi&s;e they have a Drink call'd <HI>Sicken-pen-fon,</HI> cold water poured on the Grains.</P>
<P>The People are naturally inclin'd to Pride; and to &s;hew the Antiquity of their Family, &s;ome of them derive them&s;elves the immediate and next of kinde to <HI>Adam.</HI></P>
<P>It is a thou&s;and pities the People are &s;o &s;loathful, being given to no manner of Indu&s;try, Husbandry, or any other u&s;eful improvement; which partly oc|ca&s;ions the barrenne&s;s of the Countrey &s;o much to appear, that otherwi&s;e by active &s;pirits might ea&s;i|ly evince the contrary: for though they have ma|ny Hills, Mountains, and Boggs, yet have they match|le&s;s rich Vallies.</P>
<P>It may be conjectured their &s;loathfulne&s;s may in part be occa&s;ioned by their ignorance; &s;ome of the indifferent &s;ort being brought up to read, and by the pretence of Centility, &s;corning a Trade, never heed the farther improvement of their Fortunes, or under&s;tandings, till the Father dyes, and the Elder Brother po&s;&s;e&s;s the E&s;tate.</P>
<P>They are a People generally envious, e&s;pecially of the ri&s;e of their Neighbours; naturally prag|matical, and inqui&s;itive after others affairs, and al|wayes blabbing, and telling Tales; and &s;o litigious, that they are ready to go to Law, if they &s;ee their Neighbours Hor&s;e put his head over their Hedge, or his Goo&s;e at their Barns-door.</P>
<PB N="33" REF="20" MS="y">
<P>The Women are infected with the like quarrel|&s;om humour. I have &s;een two Women about &s;ome trivial matter, fall together by the ears; the Men took each others part, one Neighbour &s;econded one, and the next another; till they had engaged two thirds of the Town in the quarrel, and none of them knew for what they fought, or how the fray began; and to be revenged the more of one another, they &s;ent the next opportunity for proce&s;s in Battery, Tre&s;pa&s;s, Scaadal, and I know not what: and then to Law they went (for they love it above any thing) when they had &s;pent their money, they were forced to put it to a Reference, and then are at an|other charge in Treating the Arbitrators, and their Friends; who having fea&s;ted them&s;elves, leave the bu&s;ine&s;s as they found it: And yet this great charge and trouble will not di&s;&s;uade them from following the&s;e litigious cour&s;es, but are never at quiet, but when they have &s;ome &s;uit or other depending: their Lawyers taking notice of the temper of the Peo|ple, promote the differences, in humouring their fancies; by which means, they continually drain their pocket, and this is one great cau&s;e of their general poverty.</P>
<P>The Commonalty are extremely awed by their Superiours; in &s;uch &s;ort, a Tenant fears as much to &s;peak again&s;t a Lord of the Mannor, or their next powerful Neighbour, as wi&s;er men would dread to &s;peak Trea&s;on again&s;t a Prince, under who&s;e Alle|giance be lives, and hath &s;worn to. And I have
<PB N="34" REF="21" MS="y">heard &s;ay, that &s;ome of them will &s;wear and for|&s;wear any thing, that may tend to the benefit of that Landlord from whom he hath any dependance, and think it no great crime.</P>
<P>Many notorious Vices are among them, which they look upon to be things of another complexi|on; and this I believe proceeds from their igno|rance in Religion: and that ignorance is occa&s;i|oned by their Superiours, who in the&s;e latter years, have ingro&s;t to them&s;elves all Church-lands, and allowance for the Clergy. In &s;everal places it is &s;o &s;mall, that &s;ix &s;uch portions will &s;carcely keep a &s;ingle man alive.</P>
<P>I knew one that had to the value of but Eigh|teen &s;hillings Engli&s;h money <HI>per Annum,</HI> to offi|ciate in <HI>Divine Service</HI> on the Sabbath day; and therefore all the re&s;t of the Week he was forc'd to Thatch, Thre&s;h, or wrought otherwayes for Three pence a day.</P>
<P>The next thing we &s;hall Treat of, is the particular parts of Wor&s;hip in their Religion;</P>
<P>And fir&s;t for Bapti&s;m, they generally do carry the Child to the Church, as &s;oon as born, if the Church be near, where at the Font the Child is named by the Godfathers and Godmothers, with a &s;hort Cere|mony; all who&s;e Chri&s;tian names, with the Parents, are conjoyned, which if wrote at length, would blot more paper than the Titles of the <HI>Grand Seignior.</HI></P>
<PB N="35" REF="21" MS="y">
<P>The Women are of a very &s;trong con&s;titution, the midling &s;ort hardly keeping their Beds three dayes at a lying in; and the fourth day will give no quarter to the groaning Ale, fight the fifth, and it may be go to Church the &s;ixth, with the mark of the Lord of <HI>Northumberland's</HI> Arms under the Callicoe Hood, which they wear for a Ker|chief.</P>
<P>Their Marriages are made like bargains of old, like a Pig in a poke un&s;een; for the Parents meet over a Cup of nappy Ale, where making &s;ome bar|gain for Wheat, Oats, or any other nece&s;&s;ary thing they want, at la&s;t &s;trike up a match between their Son and Daughter: this &s;erves in&s;tead of wooing, by which means the fir&s;t meeting is &s;eldom till the Man comes to fetch the Woman to Church, attend|ed with a Rabble of all the Relations, who mu&s;t out of pure love not be &s;ober that whole Week, and then the next Sunday attend them to Church again; and there ends the Ceremony.</P>
<P>They have no &s;cruples in their Marriages (as I could hear of) for the neare&s;t of Kin often inter|marries with the other, one man frequently marrying two Si&s;ters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Their Burials retain &s;omething of the Relicts of Popi&s;h Ceremony: for next Night after the decea&s;e of the per&s;on, every Friend, Neighbour and Rela|tion comes to his Hou&s;e, and brings each a Candle, and a Gun of Ale, where this jovial Crew light up their Lights, making a good Fire, and then drink
<PB N="36" REF="22" MS="y">remembrances of the dead, till &s;ome of them lo&s;e their own, and for want of Feet &s;tand in need as much of Bearers home, as the Corps to the Grave.</P>
<P>When the time comes to carry it out, which is within three or four dayes after the decea&s;e of the per&s;on, the Prie&s;t in his Surplice walks before the Gue&s;ts, round the Corps, all confu&s;edly, and the Corps in the middle: being near the Church, the Men put off their Hats, and then Men and Women fet up together &s;uch a hideous cry, that I can re|&s;emble it to nothing more proper, than to that, drowning Men make when the Ship is &s;inking: This they continue till they come to the Church, where the Prie&s;t in his own Language reads a little Service.</P>
<P>And here ob&s;erve the policy of the Prie&s;t: for having no certain Fee allowed for Burials, but by cu&s;tom receives the free-will-offering of the next of Kin, and Friends to the decea&s;ed; he will be &s;ure, for fear he lo&s;e any of the Gue&s;ts, to &s;top in the mid&s;t of the Service, and leaying his Book open, &s;tands with his face directly again&s;t the Corps; by which dumb &s;igns, the People knowing his mind, they make their offering. The fir&s;t of Kin goes to the Communion-Table, and throws down his Benevolence, perhaps a Six-pence, if he be a Bro|ther, or &s;o near a Relation. The re&s;t by Pence, or Two-pence, do &s;o increa&s;e the Par&s;ons &s;tock, that it may amount to Three or four &s;hillings. After
<PB N="37" REF="22" MS="y">this he goes on merrily with the remaining part of the Divine Service; and having fini&s;ht it, away to the Ale-hou&s;e, where he is &s;ure to have his charge born for that day.</P>
<P>Another &s;trange pa&s;&s;age they have at their Buri|als, which I had almo&s;t omitted; that is, they fir&s;t give wheaten Loaves to the Poor, and as the Corps &s;tands at the door on a Bier, the next of Kin to the decea&s;ed, taketh a new wooden Bowl (never u&s;ed) filled with the be&s;t Liquor they have, and half a dozen wheaten Loaves, with a good piece of Chee&s;e, and gives it cro&s;s the Corps to any whom he fancies to be the poore&s;t Beggar; who receives the &s;ame, and immediately drinks the Liquor, with a ble&s;&s;ing to the Soul departed. De&s;iring to be &s;a|tisfied concerning the meaning of that &s;trange Ce|remony, they an&s;wered, That the Souls of the de|cea&s;ed in their Rambles in the <HI>Elizium,</HI> do meet with a &s;weet-ta&s;ting plea&s;ant Fountain, of which each Soul doth drink his Bowl; and if that Ceremo|ny were not performed at the Burial of the Decea&s;ed, they think that Soul would want tho&s;e Nece&s;&s;aries in its &s;uppo&s;ed Ramble thi|ther.</P>
<P>Their Sunday is the mo&s;t lei&s;ure-day they have, on which they u&s;e all manner of Sports; in eve|ry Field a Fiddle, and the La&s;&s;es footing it till they are all of a foam, and grow infinitely proud with the blear-eye of affection her Sweet-heart ca&s;ts on her Feet, as &s;he dances, to a Tune, and no Tune,
<PB N="38" REF="23" MS="y">play'd on an In&s;trument that makes a wor&s;er noi&s;e than a Key upon a Gridiron.</P>
<P>Their greate&s;t Zeal, is in keeping Sacred &s;ome old Sayings of their great Grand&s;ires, and pre&s;erv|ing Sacred &s;ome old Relict of their Grandmothers; in both of which they are &s;o &s;trict, that for the fir&s;t, if they hear one whi&s;tle in the Night, they are afraid, and will avoid you; becau&s;e, &s;ay they, our Ance&s;tors told us, that &s;uch as whi&s;tle in the Night, convers'd with the Devil, and call tho&s;e Spirits in the Air together, by &s;uch &s;ound, to confer with them.</P>
<P>The Relicts of their Grandmothers are as &s;evere; for if &s;he leave but an old Chair, a wooden Spoon, or any other trifle to them, they will pre&s;erve it Sa|cred, fearing to prejudice it in the lea&s;t; &s;hould any &s;uch thing accidentally happen, they would ab|&s;olutely conclude it did pre&s;age &s;ome harm en&s;u|ing.</P>
<P>They are great Lovers of Women, e&s;pecially &s;uch of their own Countrey; and &s;o un&s;en&s;ible of the guilt, that they glory in the crime, and brag of their &s;purious i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>A Gentleman of good Note, whom I knew, had &s;o many, that he knew them not when he &s;aw them: &s;everal &s;trange Women whom he knew not, taking notice of this advantage, did frequently &s;end their Children to him, who to be rid of them quickly, gave them his formal ble&s;&s;ing, with &s;ome &s;mall piece of money.</P>
<PB N="39" REF="23" MS="y">
<P>I have heard of two other Gentlemen as libidi|nous as the former, the Uncle and Nephew; the latter of which living in the Metropolis of <HI>Monte|capernia,</HI> had a very hand&s;om Maid to his &s;ervant; yet although he had an incomparable Beauty to his Wife, nothing would &s;erve his turn but the enjoyment of his Maid-&s;ervant: few per&s;ua&s;ions were required to induce her to that which her own inclinations led her to; &s;o that in a lit|tle time &s;he was wholly at her Ma&s;ters devo|tion.</P>
<P>Not long after, &s;he prov'd with Child; and that he might not incur the di&s;plea&s;ure of his virtuous Wife (not that he fear'd the blemi&s;hing of his Re|putation for having a Ba&s;tard) he &s;ent her whil'&s;t &s;he was young with Child to his Uncle, that there &s;he might privately Lie in, and no notice be taken.</P>
<P>The Uncle receiv'd her, and became his Nephews Confident in his &s;toll'n Amours, without reproving him for his wantonne&s;s. Now, as one kindne&s;s de|&s;erves another; &s;o the Uncle having gotten this &s;ame Woman with Child a, little time after her de|livery, and &s;ending her to his Nephew to Lie in, the Nephew could do no le&s;s than receive her; and did &s;o, concealing the ignominy of his Uncle as much as in him lay. Such was their &s;ucce&s;s in not being di&s;covered (the Wenches mouth being &s;topt with money) that the Nephew &s;ell to work again with her as &s;oon as &s;he had delivered her loading;
<PB N="40" REF="24" MS="y">and getting her with Child, &s;ent her back to his Uncle: And thus they &s;ent her as a Token one to the other, till they had got &s;ix Children between them; and had &s;he not dy'd a little after &s;he was quick of the &s;eventh, there might have been a ge|neration between them as long as the fir&s;t Chapter of <HI>Matthew.</HI></P>
<P>More might be &s;aid <HI>in landem &amp; vituperium,</HI> in the prai&s;e and di&s;prai&s;e of <HI>Montecapernia;</HI> but my &s;tay being there but a very little, I wanted both in|formation, and further ob&s;ervation.</P>
