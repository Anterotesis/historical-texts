<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>I</HI> Here pre&s;ent You <HI>(Rea|der)</HI> with a more Exact and Particular Account of <HI>Holland,</HI> and the other <HI>Pro|vinces</HI> about which We Tra|vell'd, than was ever yet in Print.</P>
<PB REF="3">
<P>Nothing of Moment e&s;cap'd our Remark, the mo&s;t Minute (if worthy our Sight and Ob|&s;ervation) was collected, and dige&s;ted.</P>
<P>We were Three <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentlemen, all of a Piece, when We &s;et out, We &s;par'd no Co&s;t of <HI>Time,</HI> or <HI>Money;</HI> We were not Sneaking, or Ex|travagant, but thriftily Li|beral, rather than Profu&s;e; We &s;tood in the be&s;t and clea|re&s;t Light; that is, We kept the be&s;t Company, din'd at the principal Ordinaries, (where the greate&s;t Men of tho&s;e Countries think it no Dimi|nution <PB REF="3">to be pre&s;ent,) avoided (as much as with Decency We cou'd) the Conver&s;ation of our own Country-Men, Tip|ling, and Gaming; being wholly Intent upon the Bu&s;i|ne&s;s We came about,
<HI>viz.</HI> the Viewing and nicely Prying in|to the <HI>Wealth, Strength, Beauty,</HI> and <HI>Policy</HI> of the&s;e <HI>Provinces;</HI> never throughly known, or narrowly examin'd into by any of their Neigh|bour-Nations; at lea&s;t by what has appear'd in Publick of them.</P>
<P>I have not ob&s;erv'd any great Order or Method, in the Mar|&s;halling <PB REF="4">our <HI>Remarks;</HI> nor do I pretend to
<HI>Stile,</HI> or <HI>Flo|ri&s;h,</HI> having contented my &s;elf with &s;etting down our <HI>Ob|&s;ervations</HI> as We made them; I have been Faithful and Ju&s;t in the Account and De&s;cripti|on of <HI>Places</HI> and
<HI>Things,</HI> and have omitted nothing Material; I rather cho&s;e a Plain, Intelligent, Familiar, and Manly way of Expre&s;|&s;ing my &s;elf than otherwi&s;e; and, di&s;cour&s;ing of a Coun|try that boa&s;ts much of her Liberty, I have e'en taken a pretty deal my &s;elf.</P>
<PB REF="4">
<P>I have made &s;ome few <HI>Re|flections,</HI> (and tho&s;e only to open the Eyes of my Country|men, to &s;ee and pur&s;ue their <HI>own</HI> true Intere&s;t,) matter of Fact being what chiefly I aim'd at, and what mo&s;t obliges the Sen&s;ible and Inge|nious.</P>
<P>The Con&s;ideration of Obli|ging my Native Country, has prevail'd upon me to let the&s;e <HI>Papers</HI> peep abroad; there needs no Apology for them, they will &s;peak for them&s;elves: They are New, Choice, and very Curious <HI>Ob&s;ervations;</HI> <PB REF="5">if they plea&s;e, &s;o; if not,
'tis all one to the Collector, for he values neither Frowns or Smiles, Cen&s;ures or Prai&s;es of this ill-natur'd and in|grateful Age.</P>

<HEAD>THE DELIGHTS OF <HI>Holland, &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE fourteenth of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> we took Po&s;t for
<HI>Har|wich,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Anno <HI>1695.</HI></NOTE> where we arriv'd in the Evening; it rain'd from &s;even till two next Morning, &s;o that we could not get on board the Pacquet-Boat that Night, but at four the next Morning we embark'd, and were immediate|ly under Sail, the Wind very fair, being <HI>We&s;t-Nor-We&s;t,</HI> it blew a fre&s;h Gale, and continu'd with
<PB N="2" REF="6">little variation till the next Day when we arriv'd at
<HI>Helovet &s;lyice</HI> about eight in the Morning, ha|ving had a very good Pa&s;&s;age, being but twenty eight hours on the Water. We &s;taid here that whole day, which we &s;pent in walking up and down and view|ing the Fortifications of that Place, which are pretty &s;trong, towards the River, tho' there's a very &s;mall Guard kept here; the Water is deep here, and hi|ther they bring their bigge&s;t Men of War, which are built at
<HI>Rotterdam,</HI> and lay them up, ha|ving a very good Harbor, a|mong&s;t others was a Ship of 112 Guns, call'd the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> which was never at Sea, being Crank-&s;ided, as the Tar|paulins call it; that is, would not bear Sail well. This is a low&s;ie, <PB N="3" REF="6">&s;orry Village, and a very cut|throat Place, for they make us pay what they plea&s;e; but, in|deed,
'tis no other than all the Sea-Ports ever did and will do, as well in
<HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> as <HI>Holland,</HI> tho' here all Places are alike; 'tis a pretty, neat, well|built Place, Hou&s;es of Brick, and uniform; here they have Maga|zines of Naval Stores. Our Pac|quet-Boats formerly went to the <HI>Briel,</HI> but now being bigger, of greater force, becau&s;e of the War, and drawing more Water, they come to this Place, as do the Men of War that convoy his Maje&s;ty to and from <HI>Holland.</HI> We had little to remarque here More than what is mention'd, only a plea&s;ant Adventure, of a parcel of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentlemen that had never been abroad be|fore,
<PB N="4" REF="7">when they fir&s;t came on &s;hore here, they went to the be&s;t Hou&s;e for Accomodation, and immediately fell to ki&s;&s;ing and feeling the Maids, which is not &s;o cu&s;tomary here, as at home, the Servants would not come near 'em, but &s;putter'd in <HI>Dutch,</HI> which they under&s;tood not, the Mi&s;tre&s;s did &s;o too, the mad <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> Sparks they &s;wore, and huft, they'd be gone out of the Hou&s;e, which they did, but they would not receive them at any other, &s;o they came back again, and gave us opportunity to laugh at 'em; we told them their Frolicks would not go down in this Country. Hence we went by Land to the <HI>Briel</HI> in a Waggon, which is very un|ea&s;ie, and noi&s;ie too, for our Heads were hardly &s;ettled after <PB N="5" REF="7">the to&s;&s;ing we had at Sea, where mo&s;t of us clean'd our Stomachs very well, but the&s;e Waggons rattle and make &s;uch a noi&s;e, that almo&s;t made our Heads ake; they drive with a pair of Hor&s;es a-bre&s;t, without Harne&s;s, but in ordinary Geers, and travel con|&s;tantly three mile an hour, not more, nor le&s;s, which makes them reckon the Di&s;tances of Places by the Hour, and not by the League, or Mile. This Town lies about half a League from the mouth of the <HI>Mae&s;e,</HI> (a famous River, like our <HI>Thames</HI>) 'tis well fortified, pret|ty well peopled, about three thou&s;and Families, Hou&s;es in|differently well built, Streets well pav'd, cleanly and broad; Canals run through part of it, with rows of Trees on each <PB N="6" REF="8">&s;ide, plea&s;ant Meadows lie about it, but the Air is not healthful, being thick and foggy, and too near the Sea. Here was the Foundation of this famous Com|monwealth laid, for this was the fir&s;t Place that revolted a|gain&s;t <HI>Spain,</HI> her ancient Lord, in the Year
1572. It is of great Con&s;equence, having the com|mand of all Ships and Ve&s;&s;els, in their Pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> &amp;c. It was one of the Cautionary Towns put in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and re&s;tor'd to the <HI>Hollanders</HI> by King <HI>James</HI> the Fir&s;t, her Succe&s;&s;or. We &s;taid two Days here, walking a|bout and viewing the Fortifica|tions, and the whole City, which is but &s;mall; the Walls are part Brick, part Earth, two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Miles in Circumference; there
<PB N="7" REF="8">are &s;everal Pieces of Bra&s;s Can|non mounted upon Carriages upon all the Points; four Gates, with two Draw-Bridges to each, and Bulwarks to plant Cannon upon; there has been four Ravelins, and &s;ome Out-works, but we could &s;ee but one &s;tand|ing, which by the Form we gue&s;s'd to be &s;o, for 'tis out of repair, and &s;o is the whole Wall, which, in a War with <HI>En|gland,</HI> is put into a better Con|dition, with a good Gari&s;on, but they apprehend no Danger from the <HI>French;</HI> the Land about it produces good Corn, but not much: The People here are le&s;s Courteous than tho&s;e that live in the great Trading-Towns, (tho' you are not to expect great Civility from the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who pretend not to much breed|ing,)
<PB N="8" REF="9">&s;ome &s;ay, the gro&s;ne&s;s of the Air influences them in their Manners, and that the Moon, who governs them, (<HI>Cancer</HI> be|ing their A&s;cendent) makes them Clowni&s;h; but of this there is no certainty; tho' the Sea-men of all Nations are ob|&s;erved to be as rough, &s;urly, and ill-natur'd as the Element they live upon: And if the Water has Influence, why not the Air? Here is a pretty little <HI>Stadt-Hou&s;e,</HI> or
<HI>Guild-Hall,</HI> as we call it in <HI>London,</HI> and a good Church founded <HI>Anno</HI> 1372, by the Counte&s;s <HI>Matilda</HI> for them, and another Church for the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> an Ho&s;pital for Orphans, a good Market-place, and an old and new Haven. <HI>Rotterdam</HI> has got a|way all the Trade from the <HI>Briel.</HI> About ten in the Forenoon we
<PB N="9" REF="9">took <HI>Scout</HI> (which is a little Boat with a Sail, and goes every hour, the Bell ringing to give Notice to Pa&s;&s;engers, as it does in other Places,) for <HI>Maezland&s;luyce,</HI> a little Fi&s;her-Town, a League from the <HI>Briel,</HI> half an Hours &s;ail with the Wind, an hour and half again&s;t it; 'tis a plea&s;ant Place; they have within the&s;e few Years built a very good Church there; before this Place lie a great many
<HI>Bu&s;&s;es,</HI> or Fi&s;h|ing-Ve&s;&s;els, which is their chief Trade, and by which they don't only live, but grow rich, as we in <HI>England</HI> might do, if we were not infatuated; mo&s;t of their <HI>Bu&s;&s;es</HI> were gone out to Sea, to catch Herrings on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Coa&s;t, becau&s;e the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are &s;o lazy they won't catch 'em them&s;elves. About half Seas <PB N="10" REF="10">over we were met by &s;ome Friends of ours,
<HI>Dutch</HI> Mer|chants, who came from <HI>Am&s;ter|dam</HI> on purpo&s;e to receive us, which they did with all the de|mon&s;trations of Love and Joy; we went a-&s;hore together, and got to the be&s;t Hou&s;e, and fell abord the pickled Herring, which was extraordinary good; we made 'em &s;wim in Rheni&s;h Wine, of which we let down a good quantity. Here we hir'd a Waggon to carry us to <HI>Rot|terdam,</HI> which in our way we pa&s;t through.</P>
<P><HI>&V;LAERDINGEN,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ulaer|dingen.</NOTE> a League off, a &s;mall Village, a Fi&s;her-Place, 'twas anciently a City, and well fortified, but ruin'd by ly|ing &s;o near the River <HI>Mae&s;e,</HI> which broke in upon it. A League further lies <HI>Schedam,</HI> a
<PB N="11" REF="10">&s;mall City, which has a Vote a|mong&s;t the
<HI>States,</HI> and is call'd the <HI>Olde&s;t, Bolde&s;t, Wi&s;e&s;t,</HI> and was the <HI>Riche&s;t</HI> in ancient Times, wonderfully Couragious were the Inhabitants again&s;t the <HI>Spa|niards;</HI> now famous for the Fi&s;hery, and making of Nets to catch Fi&s;h. Three or four
<HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> Miles further along the &s;ame River lies
<HI>Delphs-howen,</HI> a &s;mall Town, nothing but Fi&s;her|men and Marriners live here: This Place, with &s;mall Charge, might be made impregnable, (as may many others in this Country) by rea&s;on of its &s;itua|tion near &s;o much Water.</P>
<P>Half a League from hence is <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> a great, &s;trong, fine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rotter|dam.</NOTE> and very rich City, one of the mo&s;t celebrated Ports of <HI>Europe,</HI> the Second for Trade in this Pro|vince, <PB N="12" REF="11">lying very commodiou&s;ly upon the River
<HI>Mae&s;e,</HI> has great Commerce with <HI>England, Scot|land, France,</HI> (when in Peace) and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and is much con|cern'd in great and &s;mall Fi&s;he|ry, a very flouri&s;hing Place: Here are divers Canals cut, which are &s;o well contriv'd and kept, that the greate&s;t Ships can enter, and there lie &s;ecurely; and &s;ome Ships of two and three hundred Tuns are brought up into the middle of the Town, where the Goods are deliver'd at the Merchants Doors, which is a very great conveniency. <HI>Era&s;mus,</HI> the greate&s;t Re&s;torer of Learning, was born in this City <HI>Anno Dom.</HI>
1467, he died in <HI>Fri|burg</HI> in <HI>Al&s;atia:</HI> Remarkable was the Gratitude of this People, who to pre&s;erve his Name and <PB N="13" REF="11">Memory, have at their Charge &s;et up his Effigies in Bra&s;s, well done, with a great Book in his Hand (the Leaves of which he turns over as oft as he hears the Clock &s;trike, which for&s;ooth is a Piece of <HI>Dutch</HI> Wit.) This Statue was erected, as they told us, in 1564, and roughly handled by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in 1572. 'tis now rail'd in with Iron. This City is now wholly at the Devotion of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> (now our King) the People being pa&s;&s;io|nate and zealous Lovers of his Per&s;on and Intere&s;t, which they expre&s;s to the highe&s;t upon all Occa&s;ions. Here they brew good Beer, which is &s;ent to the Cities and Villages all round a|bout; they al&s;o &s;erve the <HI>States</HI> Armies and Navies with it. Turf and Wood is their firing, the <PB N="14" REF="12">fir&s;t is cheap, the &s;econd dear, and is burnt by the better &s;ort only. As we came near any of their Towns we di&s;tingui&s;h'd an odd &s;mell, which comes from the Turf, and is unplea&s;ant, and we believe unwhol&s;om; 'tis &s;tronger than that of
<HI>New-Ca&s;tle</HI> Coal in <HI>London.</HI> The&s;e People are ge|nerally more obliging to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> than in any other Place, which is to be wholly attributed to their frequent Conver&s;ation, and Dealing with them. Here they build very great Ships of War, of a hundred Guns, and downward. We went on bord &s;ome of the bigge&s;t, and view'd them well within, and without; they are not &s;o cleaverly and neatly built as the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> nor &s;o fit for Accomodation, but more clum&s;ie, but then very <PB N="15" REF="12">&s;trong, and &s;it for Service, plain Paint, and without any Guild|ing, and very little Carving, which is a &s;uperfluous and un|nece&s;&s;ary Expence; and which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI> were once very vain in, tho' 'tis now al|mo&s;t worn out of Practice, e&s;pe|cially the Guilding, which may be proper for Yachts and Plea|&s;ure-Boats, but not for Men of War. We &s;aw their
<HI>Stadt-Hou&s;e</HI> or <HI>Guild-Hall,</HI> which is a very good Building, and Saint <HI>Lawrence</HI>'s Church, which is a great one, in it a very large old Organ, the <HI>Dutch Presbyterians</HI> being not &s;o nice and &s;queemi&s;h as the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who inveigh a|gain&s;t the U&s;e of that Mu&s;ick in Churches: In this Church are the Monuments of &s;everal great Sea-Commanders. The <HI>Engli&s;h, <PB N="16" REF="13">Scotch,</HI> and
<HI>French,</HI> have al&s;o each a Church here. Here is an open Place for the Merchants to meet in, which they call the <HI>Exchange,</HI> but no noble Piazza's to &s;ecure 'em from the Weather, as at <HI>London.</HI> We &s;taid here &s;e|veral Days, and &s;ometimes din'd at the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> &s;ometimes at the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Hou&s;es. The Ordinaries are the be&s;t and cheape&s;t Places to eat at, for then you know your Expence, which otherwi&s;e is at the VVill and Plea&s;ure of your Landlord, who Arbitrarily impo&s;es upon you; and this without redre&s;s, for if you complain to the Ma|gi&s;trate, he will give it again&s;t you, and you mu&s;t pay it; they know you are led by Curio&s;ity to pa&s;s through, to view their Country, not to live in it, and <PB N="17" REF="13">you mu&s;t contribute to the Sup|port of it. The <HI>Dutch</HI> are ill Cooks, and verifie the Proverb,
<HI>That God &s;ends Meat, and the De|vil the Dre&s;&s;er.</HI> They have abun|dance of Soupes and Slops, very in&s;ipid, they roa&s;t and boil all to Rags, &s;o that you don't know what &s;ort of Fle&s;h 'tis when it comes to the Table. The <HI>French</HI> err a little on that &s;ide, but then they make &s;ome amends with their Sawces, which are tooth|&s;ome, tho' hardly whol&s;ome; that being the be&s;t Diet, which is the &s;imple&s;t and mo&s;t agree|able to Nature; &s;o that we all agreed in this, That the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> way of Boiling, Roa&s;ting, and Broiling, with pre&s;erving the Gravy, (which is the be&s;t Sawce) is the be&s;t in the World.</P>
<PB N="18" REF="14">
<P>To <HI>DELFT</HI> we went next,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Delft.</NOTE> betwixt which Place and <HI>Rotter|dam</HI> is a great Magazine of Gun-Powder for the <HI>States</HI> Service, 'tis a well-built Brick Hou&s;e with a Draw-Bridge, and a Moat all round it, which is wi&s;ely con|triv'd, that if it &s;hould by any Accident (which &s;ometimes hap|pens) blow up, it cannot do any other Damage; for 'tis dan|gerous to lodge great Maga|zines (as in the
<HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London</HI>) near great and populous Cities. This very City of <HI>Delft</HI> was grie|vou&s;ly &s;hatter'd by the blowing up of the great Magazine of Powder kept there <HI>Anno</HI> 1654, which occa&s;ion'd the building the afore&s;aid Hou&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Delft</HI> is a fair and populous City, very clean, well built, and very plea&s;ant; well &s;eated in a <PB N="19" REF="14">Plain of Meadows, which may be laid all round under Water, if they open their Sluces, when the Wind is Ea&s;t-North-Ea&s;t. At the Entrance of it &s;tands a general Magazine of Warlike Stores (but no Powder) for the Publick Service. This City was burnt to A&s;hes <HI>Anno</HI> 1536, but &s;oon re-built, and now in grea|ter Glory than ever. The <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company of this Place have here a very good Hou&s;e and large Ware-Hou&s;es; as al&s;o an eighth part of the Great or General Stock, this being the Third Town of <HI>Holland,</HI> having the Third Voice in the <HI>States,</HI> whither it &s;ends Deputies, as al&s;o to all the other Colleges. Here are very fine Buildings, and a|mong&s;t them the Town-Hou&s;e, with the&s;e two Ver&s;es on the Front.</P>
<PB N="20" REF="15">
<Q><L>Haec domus odit, amat, punit, con|&s;ervat, honorat,</L>
<L>Nequitiam, Pacem, Crimina, Jura, Probos.</L></Q>
<P>Here is a &s;pacious Market-Place between this Hou&s;e and the great Church, in which &s;tands <HI>William</HI> the Fir&s;t Prince of
<HI>Orange</HI> (Great Grand-Father to his Sacred Ma|je&s;ty King
<HI>William</HI>) at full length, in Armor, in Copper Effigie; at each corner of this Monument &s;tands <HI>Ju&s;tice, Prudence, Tempe|rance,</HI> and
<HI>Valour,</HI> all in Copper, and very large; and be&s;ides this, the Prince lies at length in Mar|ble, with a Dog (having had his Life once &s;av'd by a Dog) at his Feet, all under Marble Py|ramids: 'Tis the mo&s;t Magnifi|cent Tomb in all the <HI>Seventeen <PB N="21" REF="15">Provinces.</HI> Here that Prince kept his Court, and here was that brave Prince a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated in the
51&s;t Year of his Age, being &s;hot by a Pi&s;tol with three Bullets, as he ro&s;e from the Table, by one <HI>Balthazar Gerrard,</HI> a
<HI>Burgundian,</HI> &s;o that he died without having time to &s;ay any more than, <HI>Lord have Mercy on my Soul and this poor People.</HI> The Murderer pre|tended to be a <HI>Prote&s;tant,</HI> and Son of one who had &s;uffer'd for his Religion; by which he in&s;inua|ted him&s;elf into the Prince's Fa|vour, who employ'd and in|tru&s;ted him in Bu&s;ine&s;s of Im|portance: The Villain never of|fer'd to get off, but was taken and pinch'd to death with hot Irons, his Fle&s;h being fir&s;t &s;la&s;h'd with a Knife, and &s;o Piece by Piece torn off with hot Pincers; <PB N="22" REF="16">he died ob&s;tinate, and &s;aid,
<HI>If it were to do again, he would do it.</HI></P>
<P>In the t'other Church is a Monument of Admiral <HI>Trump</HI>'s, inrich'd with Miniature, and a fine In&s;cription: 'Tis a &s;tately one, with the Arms of his Fami|ly hanging in Frames over it: 'Twas erected at the
<HI>States</HI> Charge, in acknowledgment, for the good Service he did his Country.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame Church is <HI>Myn Heer Pithin</HI>'s Tomb, a very hand&s;ome one: He was a <HI>Dutch</HI> Admiral, and took the Plate-Fleet from the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> The Churches here, and in all the Seven
<HI>&V;nited-Provinces,</HI> are ge|nerally bigger than ours in
<HI>En|gland,</HI> but fewer in Number.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="16">
<P>Here is a large and neat Market, or Fle&s;h-Hall (as they call it) for all &s;orts of Butchers Meat, which they have very good, and in great plenty, and not dear truly; which I the ra|ther mention, becau&s;e they who have not travell'd, upbraid the <HI>Dutch</HI> with living upon Onions, Roots, Herb, Milk, and pickled Herrings, and &s;ay, they have no Fle&s;h, and rarely eat any; 'tis true, they aae &s;paring, and I be|lieve 'tis the better for their Health; for the devouring a|bundance of Fle&s;h mu&s;t needs fill our Bodies with many hot and gro&s;s Humours, and con|&s;equently impair our Health. They have al&s;o a good Fi&s;h-Market here, and another of Fruits, Roots, and Herbs.</P>

<P>The People in this City are rich, trade much to Sea, and make much Porcelain, or fine Earthen Wares, to a great Per|fection, tho' far &s;hort of
<HI>China,</HI> which they pretend to re&s;emble, and brew good Beer here; but the Remark we made in general of their Beer (of which they have many &s;orts, as <HI>Rotterdam</HI> Beer, <HI>Dort, Engli&s;h</HI> Beer, white Beer, &s;weet Beer, <HI>Breda</HI> Beer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) is, That tho' they have an Art of refining it, &s;o that it looks (&s;ome of it) very clear, yet it ta&s;tes in&s;ipid, and indeed is but weak, compar'd to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> having little or no reli&s;h of the Mault.</P>
<P>From hence we went to the <HI>Hague,</HI> which is three Miles, or an Hour farther, a Village, as 'tis generally call'd, but a very
<PB N="25" REF="17">beautiful one, the fine&s;t in the World, agreed by all Travellers: The very <HI>Italians</HI> them&s;elves confe&s;s it, who may ju&s;tly boa&s;t of the be&s;t Buildings in the World, tho' there are &s;ome of that Nation that chu&s;e to live here rather than at home, &s;ay|ing, <HI>this is the plea&s;ante&s;t Place in the World;</HI> tho' we mu&s;t own we are not altogether of their Opinion. It is certainly the fine&s;t Village in
<HI>Europe,</HI> and much exceeding many Cities in Bigne&s;s, and Beauty. In this Place it was that the <HI>States</HI> by their Edict <HI>Anno</HI> 1586, abroga|ted the Authority of <HI>Philip</HI> the Second King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and held a Conference upon the Five Ar|ticles of the Remon&s;trants,
<HI>An.</HI> 1610, which brought about the calling of the Synod of

<HI>Orange</HI> us'd to keep their Courts here, till the pre&s;ent Prince
<HI>William</HI> a&s;cended the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Throne. The Earls of
<HI>Holland</HI> had their Re&s;idence here, and founded the Prince's Hou&s;e, which is a good old Brick-Build|ing, with a Court before it, for the Foot-Guards to draw up in, and lodge or ground their Arms in. Here the States General, the States Provincial, the Court of <HI>Holland,</HI> the High-Council Court of <HI>Brabrant,</HI> and the Council of State a&s;&s;emble; but that Cham|ber which de&s;erves mo&s;t Notice, and a particular De&s;cription, is where the States of <HI>Holland</HI> meet, which is indeed a very fine, &s;pacious, lofty Room, with very fine Hangings round, which touch the very Cieling, <PB N="27" REF="18">with their Arms curiou&s;ly wove in them, made on purpo&s;e for them; &s;ome People of mo&s;t Na|tions are al&s;o wove in the&s;e Hangings, as if looking over Galleries; which, when the Room is a little darkned, which is done by the Servant that &s;hows it, the better to repre&s;ent it, appears as if they were all alive, nodding of their Heads and talking to one another. The Cieling it &s;elf is painted very finely, by an
<HI>Italian</HI> Ma&s;ter; as al&s;o the Two Chimney-Pieces, in which are repre&s;ented Peace and War, very curiou&s;ly; the fir&s;t is <HI>Ve|nus,</HI> a very beautiful Woman, with a pure white Dove on her Lap, with other Emblems of Peace about her; the &s;econd is <HI>Mars,</HI> or a Soldier compleatly armed, with a Plume of Fea|thers <PB N="28" REF="19">on his Head-piece, tram|pling on a great open Book, all bloody, on which is writ in large Letter,
<HI>PRIVELEGIA.</HI> The Seats are all rail'd in; that of the Princes, is an Elbow-chair at the upper-end of the Table; about which (on Chairs with Backs) &s;its the Knighthood of <HI>Holland,</HI> who have but one Vote, which each City that &s;ends De|puties has; and at the lower|end &s;its the Pen&s;ioner, who is Keeper of the Great Seal and Secretary, as they told us, before whom lies a &s;mall wooden Ham|mer, which when he knocks with, is that their Debates cea&s;e, and they be &s;ilent.

<P>The <HI>&V;nited-Provinces</HI> are &s;o call'd, from their Union at <HI>&V;|trecht, Anno</HI> 1579.

The&s;e Provinces, which before own'd Subjection to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and were wonderfully Loyal to their Prince, Lovers of his Per&s;on, and Zealous for his Intere&s;t, till he fell in upon their E&s;tabli&s;h|ments, their Religious and Civil Rights, have &s;ince been Indepen|dent of one another, or to &s;peak &s;trictly and more properly, are Seven Commonwealths, which altogether now make but one, under the Name of, <HI>The States General of the</HI> United-Provinces <HI>of the</HI> Low-Countries: The Dig|nity

There is no State in being, of &s;o &s;mall an extent, which has &s;o great a Number of Fortre&s;&s;es, and which &s;eems better defended by the Nature of the Places than this.

<HI>Orange</HI> (now King of <HI>England,</HI>) it being the time the
<HI>French</HI> King invaded them with mighty Armies, which like a Torrent over-run all, and made &s;uch &s;urpri&s;ing Conque&s;ts, that in a very &s;hort time they reduced three Provinces, and between fifty and &s;ixty con&s;i|derable Towns; but their Pro|gre&s;s was &s;topt, and they repell'd by the Bravery and Conduct of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> who new modell'd the States Armies, and <PB N="34" REF="22">from raw, inexpert, and undi|&s;ciplin'd Soldiers, and bad Offi|cers, (rais'd by the Favour and Intere&s;t of the Burgo-Ma&s;ters and Principal Magi&s;trates) made them very formidable to their Enemies, and &s;natch'd the Law|rels from the greate&s;t Generals of the Age, at the Head of the be&s;t Troops, and recover'd part of their Lo&s;&s;es, and had the re&s;t re&s;ign'd by the Peace <HI>Anno</HI> 1678.</P>
<P>The Admiralty has five Se&s;&s;i|ons, (and as many Magazines,) which are tho&s;e of <HI>Rotterdam, Am&s;terdam, Enkuy&s;en, Midleburg,</HI> and <HI>Harlingen:</HI> The three fir&s;t in <HI>Holland,</HI> the fourth in

<P>Here are &s;ome Remains of their ancient Nobility, &s;ome Branches of the <HI>Bredreodes,</HI> the <HI>Wa&s;&s;enaers,</HI> and the

<P>Mo&s;t of the Towns in this Province are beautiful and plea|&s;ant, having been built in the la&s;t Age.</P>

Here is kept (in a Chamber at the fur|ther end) the High Court of Ju&s;tice, from which no Appeals are granted, and to which all are made. The Civil or <HI>Roman</HI> Law is in practi&s;e all over the&s;e Countries. This Village has no Vote among the <HI>States,</HI> not be|cau&s;e

<P>The <HI>Hague</HI> paies more Exci&s;e for Wine and other Liquors, than <HI>Am&s;terdam, Rotterdam,</HI> and <HI>Dort,</HI> three great Cities, put to|gether, as they told us; and it has the face of Truth, for here is the great concour&s;e of Tra|vellers, Nobility, Gentry, Fo|reign Emba&s;&s;adors, Envoys, Re|&s;idents, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And now, (and for &s;ome Years pa&s;t) of the <HI>Congre&s;s,</HI> the&s;e are the Wine-Bibbers, for the common
<HI>Dutch</HI> are &s;atisfied with a &s;opie of Brandy-Wine, a Dram of that Liquor does their Bu&s;ine&s;s better, it keeps out the Cold and the Fogs, quick|ens them, and makes them fitter for Action; and, indeed, they &s;eem to have &s;ome occa&s;ion for it, for they are naturally &s;low and heavy, but then very dili|gent and con&s;tant, el&s;e 'twould <PB N="39" REF="24">have been impo&s;&s;ible to have fi|ni&s;h'd &s;uch great Works as they to their Honour, and the Safety of their Country have happily atchiev'd. And indeed &s;trong and &s;pirituous Liquors &s;eem to me to be more nece&s;&s;ary for, as well as natural to this Nation, conducing mightily to the con|&s;ervation of their Health, which mu&s;t needs be fluctuating, where the Air is &s;o foul: Their Coun|try is a Bog, a Mar&s;h, full of Va|pours and Fogs, which are Ear|thy, and Sulphureous, and &s;end forth unplea&s;ant and unwhol|&s;om Scents; and therefore their frequent Tippling ought not to be charg'd on them as a Crime, e&s;pecially by a Neighbour-Na|tion (the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>) who have a better Country, and a better Air, and are in their own Na|tures
<PB N="40" REF="25">more lively, brisk, and pert, having more Heat, more Fire within, are as Cholerick as the t'other Flegmatick, drudge not like them, therefore want not the like Supports, being lazy and idle People, chu&s;ing rather (&s;ome of 'em) to &s;tarve than work. Be&s;ides, they Bumper it but &s;eldom, and at &s;et, and up|on &s;olemn Occa&s;ions, and then forbear a good while, or at lea&s;t &s;ome time, but my <HI>Country-men,</HI> to their &s;hame, are always Sot|ting and Drunkening, toiling at it, and valuing them&s;elves up|on making one another Drunk; indeed, 'tis a noble Atchievement to Fuddle the whole <HI>Company:</HI> 'Tis a glorious <HI>Conque&s;t</HI> to leave 'em all &s;lain upon the Floor, (as they call it.) Now the bearing of much &s;trong Liquor is an <PB N="41" REF="25">argument of a thick Skull ra|ther than otherwi&s;e, which I find few very fond of, at lea&s;t none would have it if they could help it.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon we hired a Coach, a very genteel one, and the Coach-Man in a good Habit, of grey, re&s;embling a Livery, with a pair of hand&s;om, fat, well-kept Hor&s;es; we agreed with him to wait upon us the whole Afternoon, which he did, for about Eight Shillings Ster|ling; and fir&s;t carried us to the Prince's Hou&s;e in the <HI>Bo&s;ch</HI> or Wood, about two Miles from the <HI>Hague;</HI> 'tis a very pretty well-built (tho' old) Box, (as we call &s;mall Seats in <HI>England</HI>) with good Gardens, tho' not now very well kept; at the En|trance of this Hou&s;e &s;tand Four
<PB N="42" REF="26">whole Marble Effigies of <HI>William</HI> the Fir&s;t,
<HI>Maurice</HI> his Brother, <HI>Henry,</HI> and <HI>William</HI> the Second, (the pre&s;ent King of <HI>Great Bri|tain</HI>'s Father,) all Princes of
<HI>Orange,</HI> very curiou&s;ly done. Directly forwards is a lofty, well-painted, well-guilt, well-floor'd &s;mall Hall, with a Gal|lery for Mu&s;ick all round the top of it, and three or four &s;mall lodging Rooms below, and &s;everal very good ones a|bove, one Clo&s;et of all true
<HI>In|dian</HI> Japan, made of Cabinets or Che&s;ts taken in pieces; 'tis three Yards long, and one and a half broad. The Wall and Cielings all round beautified with curi|ous Paintings, repre&s;enting the Actions of <HI>Frederick Henry,</HI> Prince of <HI>Orange.</HI> The Wood in which this little Hou&s;e
<PB N="43" REF="26">(fit only for Banqueting, or a Supper in the cool of a Sum|mer's Evening, or, indeed, a re|treat with a Mi&s;tre&s;s) &s;tands is very plea&s;ant, and with co&s;t might be made much more de|lightful. There is a pretty deal of Ground about it, and well wooded, but has no Deer, or any other Game.</P>
<P>As we came back we rid by the <HI>Mall</HI> or <HI>Mell,</HI> much like that in St. <HI>James</HI>'s <HI>Park,</HI> but not &s;o neat, or well kept, being not &s;o much frequented. Then we were drove back through part of the <HI>Hague</HI> to <HI>Schevelin,</HI> (up|on a fine &s;mooth way, pav'd all with Bricks, and planted on each &s;ide with Trees, to make it plea|&s;ant, which was done at va&s;t Ex|pence, being before all &s;andy Hills,) a little Village about two <PB N="44" REF="27">Miles from thence, fam'd in Sto|ry for the Embarkation of <HI>Charles</HI> the Second King of <HI>En|gland,</HI> when he went to take Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Three Crowns, from which he had been long kept by the U&s;urper <HI>Oliver Crom|well.</HI> 'Tis a little Fi&s;her-Place; we rid along the &s;hoar two or three Hours, in view of the Oce|an or Main-Sea, where we ob|&s;erv'd &s;ome Wrecks on that Coa&s;t.</P>
<P>Between <HI>Schevelin</HI> and the <HI>Hague</HI> is a Hou&s;e of
<HI>Myn Heer Bentink</HI>'s, (now Earl of <HI>Portland</HI>) it is but an ordinary old Piece of Building, tho' his Lord&s;hip has lately added &s;ome new Lodg|ings to it, but the Gardens are new and very extraordinary; there is a very fine Orangerie, and a new well-built Room or <PB N="45" REF="27">Green-hou&s;e to pre&s;erve them in Winter, and in the middle and at each end a great Stove, in which great Fires are kept du|ring the extreme cold Weather. In the middle of the new Gar|den is a fine Oval Fountain. The Garden is made up like a Half-Moon, full of fine Flower-Pots: In the old Garden is a neat Aviary, and a &s;mall Moat with Fowl in it, fine Walks and Figures, and a Summer-Hou&s;e built upon an Artificial Rock.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the Principal Build|ings in the <HI>Hague,</HI> the Hou&s;e built by Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> claims the fir&s;t Rank, for 'tis a &s;tately One, of Modern Structure. Here <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, King of
<HI>Great Britain,</HI> was lodged and treated by the <HI>States</HI> when his
<PB N="46" REF="28">Maje&s;ty came from <HI>Breda</HI> to em|bark for
<HI>England, Anno</HI> 1660. The Dukes of <HI>Brandenburg, Saxo|ny,</HI> and others of the Illu&s;trious <HI>German</HI> Princes, when they come to the
<HI>Hague</HI> on Vi&s;it, or Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, are conducted hither, and remain here during their &s;tay. In this Hou&s;e are the Pictures of mo&s;t of the
<HI>European</HI> Kings, and a great many <HI>American</HI> Ra|rities. In the Years 1672 and 1673, the Inhabitants were in great Pain le&s;t the
<HI>French,</HI> who were then very near them, &s;hou'd have made 'em a Vi&s;it, becau&s;e there's no Fortifications, only a Ditch of Water: The Trees round about it were order'd to be cut down, to impede the <HI>French</HI> in their march, who, like very civil Gentlemen, came not to give them the lea&s;t Di&s;tur|bance; <PB N="47" REF="28">young Trees are &s;ince planted in the room of the old. The Confu&s;ion then was &s;uch, that they &s;ent &s;everal Waggons laden with Money, and the Pub|lick Accompts, to be &s;ecur'd in the
<HI>Stadt-Hou&s;e</HI> of <HI>Am&s;terdam.</HI></P>
<P>And much about this time was the fatal and &s;udden Trage|dy acted on the two unhappy Brothers, <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Cornelis de Wit;</HI> the one &s;aid to be the grea|te&s;t States-man in the World; the other an Admiral, who had al&s;o &s;erv'd in an eminent Po&s;t in the Civil Government. The Populace ro&s;e and cut them both in Pieces, without &s;uffering them to &s;peak one Word for them&s;elves; they always oppos'd the Intere&s;t of the Hou&s;e of <HI>O|range,</HI> which was the true In|tere&s;t of their State, to which <PB N="48" REF="29">they were believ'd to be Ene|mies: And thus fell
<HI>John de Wit,</HI> who was allow'd by all to have been a very extraordinary Man, after a long Admini&s;tration of the great and principal Affairs of this Republick.</P>
<P>Here are a great many <HI>En|gli&s;h, French, Scots, Germans,</HI> and &s;ome of mo&s;t Nations in <HI>Europe,</HI> but more <HI>Germans</HI> and
<HI>French</HI> than any.</P>
<P>Near the Town &s;tands an Iron Cage (&s;eldom us'd) in which are put notorious Criminals, to be expos'd to the Scorn and Contempt of the Rabble.</P>
<P>We went to the new Church, built not many Years &s;ince up|on the very Spot where the common Bawdy-Hou&s;es &s;tood, which were pull'd down to make way for this noble Stru|cture: <PB N="49" REF="29">A happy Conver&s;ion! Hou&s;es of Filth and Unclean|ne&s;s turn'd into a Hou&s;e of Prayer! 'Tis adorn'd with Of|ficers Arms, and E&s;cutcheons of the Nobility and Gentry. They call it an Oval Building, but I think it almo&s;t round; it has no Pillars within, &s;o that all the People may &s;ee as well as hear the Mini&s;ter: 'Tis a large Church, and as they told us, there is not &s;o fine a one in all the
<HI>Seventeen Pronvinces;</HI> be|hind it is the Rag-&s;treet, where there is kept a great Rag-Mar|ket; abundance of Money is got by buying and &s;elling that &s;ort of mean Merchandize.</P>
<P>We went hence to view the great Church, which is a good old Piece of Building, with a very high &s;quare Brick Steeple, <PB N="50" REF="30">&s;een afar off; here is Admiral <HI>Opdam</HI>'s Monument, 'tis very Magnificent; he commanded the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet in an Engage|ment with the
<HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> he was blown up, Ship and all; he had the Folly and Vanity to carry a Broom in his Main-top; as much as to &s;ay, he would &s;weep the Sea of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> but they made a &s;hift to &s;end him and his Broom to take the Air; he was a bold fighting Fellow, but a Man of no great Conduct.</P>
<P>Then we were &s;hew'd the Cloi&s;ter-Church, which is a large Pile, built <HI>Anno</HI> 1399. And &s;o to the <HI>French</HI> Church, which was formerly the Chappel of the Earls of <HI>Holland;</HI> they &s;ay, 'tis bigger than the <HI>French</HI> Church in <HI>Lon|don,</HI> but we thought not &s;o.</P>
<PB N="51" REF="30">
<P>Here is an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Church, or Chappel rather, for 'tis a &s;mall one, very plain and ordinary. The <HI>Germans</HI> preach there early in the Morning, then the <HI>En|gli&s;h,</HI> who have the <HI>Engli&s;h Li|turgy</HI> read to 'em; the Auditors are but few, we counted about Seventy. Here are a great ma|ny fine Buildings, fit for Petty Princes, they are fill'd with Emba&s;&s;adors, Envoys, Re&s;i|dents, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>We hir'd a Coach to carry us to <HI>Hon&s;layerdyke,</HI> one of King <HI>William</HI>'s Hou&s;es; in our way thither we pa&s;t through
<HI>Ry&s;wick,</HI> a little Village, with a good Church, a Mile from the
<HI>Hague;</HI> and a little farther another Vil|lage, call'd
<HI>Watringe;</HI> as al&s;o the Seats of many Country Gen|tlemen, plea&s;antly &s;ituated, with <PB N="52" REF="31">long Rows of Trees on each &s;ide the Walk which leads to the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Hon&s;laerdyke</HI> is about eight or nine Miles from the
<HI>Hague,</HI> almo&s;t the &s;ame Di&s;tance as <HI>Hampton-Court</HI> from
<HI>London;</HI> it is a very neat Piece of Building, Founded by <HI>Henry</HI> Prince of <HI>O|range,</HI> the King's Grand-Father, about &s;ixty or &s;eventy Years ago; 'tis a pretty Square, with a Ba&s;s-Court, and very hand|&s;om Moat all round it: King <HI>William</HI> has lately added &s;ome new Lodgings to it. Here was always a Guard of Hor&s;e and Foot Soldiers without, and
<HI>Swit|zers</HI> within Doors, who are lu&s;ty &s;winging Fellows, with black frizzing Hair and great Whiskers, they wear flat Caps and Cloaks, and look big and <PB N="53" REF="31">hand&s;omly for a Guard, when the King was here.</P>
<P>The Gardens that belong to this Hou&s;e are not extraordina|ry, they are well made up and neatly kept; in the middle &s;tands a Fountain, eight Leaden gilt Statues, and three or four Stone Images about it. Here are ma|ny and long Walks, adorn'd with Trees, which front the Hou&s;e, and make it very plea|&s;ant: Two &s;mall Parks with low Pails, and &s;hallow Ditches about them; a few Deer; we ob|&s;erv'd no difference between them and the
<HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> here are above ten or twelve Couple of Hounds, and a very large Avi|ary with great variety of Birds.</P>
<P>It was our fortune to con|ver&s;e but &s;eldom with the
<HI>Dutch,</HI> tho' many of them&s;peak prompt <PB N="54" REF="32"><HI>French,</HI> however we engag'd in Di&s;cour&s;e with three or four Gentlemen, led by Curio&s;ity to &s;ee this Hou&s;e, who among&s;t other things, told us, as their Ob&s;ervation, That we had in <HI>England</HI> (where they &s;aid they had been) three &s;orts of Ver|min; (we were glad to hear we had no more,) but demand|ing what they were, they an|&s;wer'd, <HI>Par&s;ons, Phy&s;icians, and Lawyers, who devour all the good Things of this World;</HI> they told us, they kept their Mini&s;ters in due Bounds, and upon the Le|vel, there were none rich, but none poor, they had no Arch|bi&s;hopricks, Bi&s;hopricks, Deana|ries, Prebendaries, and fat Li|vings; the <HI>States</HI> paid their Par&s;ons their Stipend, u&s;ually about One hundred and fifty,
<PB N="55" REF="32">or two hundred Pounds Sterling <HI>per Annum;</HI> they kept to their Texts, and never meddled with their Affairs of <HI>State,</HI> or any Se|cular Matters, but contented them&s;elves with Admoni&s;hing the People from their Pulpits to lead good Lives, which they them&s;elves were good Examples of; no &s;awcy Prie&s;ts there, to thru&s;t their No&s;es into, and in|termeddle with other Mens Bu|&s;ine&s;s; if any of their Preach|ers happen'd at any time to make any Sallies of Zeal, and touch the <HI>States</HI> never &s;o ten|derly, they had a Staff and a clean pair of Shooes &s;ent, and were told they mu&s;t troop off.</P>
<P>The&s;e Gentlemen al&s;o gave us their Sentiments of the
<HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Scotch</HI> Soldiers, they <PB N="56" REF="33">own'd they were both Brave; that the <HI>Scots</HI> wou'd, and the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> wou'd not work; that the fir&s;t cou'd fare hard, but not the t'other; the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man mu&s;t be well fed, good pow|der'd Beef and Pudding, and good Ale was his fare, and if he had that nothing cou'd wrong him.</P>
<P>We went to the Place where they ca&s;t Cannon and Mor|tars; 'tis a hand&s;ome well-built Hou&s;e; there were &s;everal Pieces in the Mold, and a great many newly ca&s;t; as al&s;o Mortars, all fit for the Field: thence to the Magazine, where they lay up their Cannon, Mortars, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with the Harne&s;s and other Tac|kle belonging to Carriages and Waggons.</P>
<PB N="57" REF="33">
<P>The Streets of the <HI>Hague</HI> are very broad and clean, Hou&s;es large, and &s;pruce without, and very neat within, even to a nice|ty, which is often trouble&s;ome; which chiefly ari&s;es from the Pride of being thought to be, and admir'd for a good Hou&s;e|wife: This Place is populous, abounding with Gentry and rich Citizens, many of which keep Coaches; in a word, the <HI>Hague</HI> is really a very plea&s;ant and de|lightful Place.</P>
<P>Here are a great many Mar|kets, &s;ome of all &s;orts of fine Flowers, Fruits, Herbs, and Roots, in great Quantity; all which are generally larger than ours, except Colliflowers, and Artichokes, in which we really excel them; and tho' our com|mon Cherries, red and white <PB N="58" REF="34">Curran's are not &s;o large and beautiful as theirs, yet they are much plea&s;anter in their ta&s;te, &s;weeter, to be eat without Su|gar, and theirs not; they have abundance of black Curran's (which we have not, here and there only in a noble Man's Garden that is curious) they have an unplea&s;ant, Phy&s;ical ta&s;te, and therefore they put them into Brandy, as we do black Cherries, and, they &s;ay, 'tis a great Cordial.</P>
<P>Their Fi&s;h-Markets is well pro|vided, and abounds with live and dead, but mo&s;t of the fir&s;t, for even the common People will hardly purcha&s;e the la&s;t; here is great &s;tore of Salmon, which they &s;lice alive, for then it &s;hrivels up, which they e|&s;teem the be&s;t; tho' we did not <PB N="59" REF="34">agree with them, for we cho&s;e a great intire Piece, and had it boil'd, and with <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Sawce brought up to the Table: Perch, Soals, and Flounders in great a|bundance, which they fell by the Pound, four Pence, five Pence, &s;ix Pence, &s;even Pence, and eight Pence, which is a high Price, and rarely happens, but after very hard and long Win|ters, and a &s;ucceeding cold Spring, and wet Summer, which de&s;troys the Spawn, and hinders the growth and increa&s;e of Fi&s;h in general. Here are al&s;o Mar|kets of Chee&s;e, Butter, Baskets, Stockings, Silk, Thred, Lace, and a great many Baubles.</P>
<P>Nor is the Fle&s;h-Market here to be pa&s;t by, for there is choice of all &s;orts of Butchers Meat, and very good in the Kinds;
<PB N="60" REF="35">their Veal is altogether as white, and rathe larger than ours; the Mutton &s;hort and tender, (&s;eeding much upon Turneps) is &s;weet, but not &s;o much in e&s;teem (nor indeed &s;o good) as our <HI>Ban&s;ted</HI> and <HI>Tunbridge</HI> Mutton; their Beef good, but &s;mall and thin, brought from <HI>Denmark,</HI> and not very fat, not &s;talled as ours; in that they fall &s;hort of us; for 'tis agreed by all Tra|vellers, that the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> is the be&s;t Beef in the World, far ex|ceeding all, even the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> who have good Land, and breed good Cattel; but the difference appears in the &s;alting more than the &s;ight, for no Beef endures that like ours, and that for the longe&s;t Voiages; however, to this Market at the <HI>Hague</HI> is the be&s;t in all the&s;e Provinces <PB N="61" REF="35">brought, becau&s;e 'twill yield the be&s;t Price here. The&s;e People are very neat and cleanly about their Fle&s;h, Butter, Chee&s;e, and other Things; nay, the meane&s;t among 'em have not only good but clean Linnen. Here are two Butter-Markets, one Whole&s;ale, t'other Retail, a great deal in each; the <HI>Dutch</HI> are not call'd <HI>Butter-Boxes</HI> in je&s;t, for they eat abundance, and carry it in Pew|ter-Boxes, and keep it in &s;uch on board their Ships, which might give occa&s;ion to the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> to call them &s;o; in return of which, they nick-name the Engli&s;h <HI>Starts;</HI> that is, <HI>Tails;</HI> tho', as we told them, they had little rea&s;on, for we us'd to &s;ee theirs oftner than they ours, ha|ving oftner beat them in Sea-Engagements than they us.</P>
<PB N="62" REF="36">
<P>To divert our &s;elves we went to &s;ee their Spin-Hou&s;es, or
<HI>Bridewell,</HI> where old Women are confin'd for Drunkenne&s;s, and young ones for Whoredom; here's not an idle Body in this Place, &s;ome Spinning, others ma|king Lace, others Plain-work; they come to the Barrs and hold out a Plate to beg our Charity, and there entertain us with &s;ome Liquori&s;h Di&s;cour&s;e. They are kept here for Weeks, Months, and Years; all according to the greatne&s;s, or &s;malne&s;s of their Crimes. 'Tis al&s;o a Pri&s;on for Debtors, which are not expos'd to view. Here we were told a plea&s;ant Story, the Fact thus; A young Gentleman of <HI>Am&s;ter|dam,</HI> coming by Water hither in one of their common Pa&s;|&s;age-Boats, drawn by Hor&s;es,
<PB N="63" REF="36">was extremely Amorous upon a young Lady that was among the Company, and was &s;o Im|portunate in his Addre&s;&s;es, that he was very trouble&s;ome, which oblig'd that Lady to give him &s;ome hopes of obtaining his de|&s;ire when they came a&s;hoar, which made him quiet and ea|&s;ie; as &s;oon as ever they landed, he attack'd her afre&s;h by him|&s;elf; &s;he told him, that &s;he had bu&s;ine&s;s to do for her Mother, which would employ two or three Hours of her time, but that &s;he would meet him exact|ly at Four at &s;uch a Hou&s;e, tel|ling him the Ma&s;ter's Name, (which he took care not to for|get) &s;o they parted, he about his, &s;he about her Affairs; &s;he goes directly to this Place, and tells the Ma&s;ter that her Brother
<PB N="64" REF="37">would be there by and by and ask for her, that he was a very Debauchee, and &s;o very lew'd, and extravagant, that her Father could not tell what to do with him, but &s;ent her to de&s;ire him to receive him into his Care, and give him the Di&s;cipline of the Hou&s;e, (this was a private
<HI>Bride|well,</HI> or Hou&s;e of Correction,) which he thought might reduce him. The amorous Youth ar|riv'd at the limited Minute, and asking for &s;uch a Lady, he was admitted, but pre&s;ently confin'd to a Chamber, and (according to the laudable Cu&s;tom) di&s;ci|plin'd, and told that was all the Sport he mu&s;t expect here; they kept him a Fortnight or three Weeks, and cool'd him, and &s;o let him out.</P>
<PB N="65" REF="37">
<P>In the <HI>Hague</HI> is a very good Alms-Hou&s;e, given by a private Gentleman; 'tis a hand&s;om well|built Square, pretty Appart|ments, and Gardens to each, with all manner of Conveniencies; here are Three&s;core Women, half <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> half <HI>Papi&s;ts:</HI> The rea&s;on of this mixture is, The Founder, who was of the <HI>Reform'd Religion,</HI> died before they were fini&s;h'd, and left the Perfecting of the Work, and Management of the Revenues, to a <HI>Roman Catholick,</HI> who put in half of his own
<HI>Religion.</HI></P>
<P>The old Buildings here are all of Brick; of which they have three &s;orts, whiti&s;h, pali&s;h red, and deep red, better workt up and burnt than ours. Their new Buildings are of Stone, and Stone and Brick; magnificent,
<PB N="66" REF="38">noble, and great, lofty Cielings, large Windows, very good
<HI>French</HI> Gla&s;s, but they have not Sa&s;hes yet, being not &s;o great Apes of Imitation as their Neigh|bours the <HI>French</HI> and
<HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> One would think Marble grew here; that is, that there were great and va&s;t Quarries of it in this Country, for rich and poor, old and new Hou&s;es, have all their fir&s;t Floors pav'd with black and white Marble; not cour&s;e and ordinary, but very good of the Kind, with great Variety in the manner of laying it: Nay, tho' <HI>Italy,</HI> whence it comes, be nearer
<HI>France,</HI> yet the pre&s;ent <HI>French</HI> King bought mo&s;t of his Marble, for the fam'd Building at <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> at
<HI>Am&s;ter|dam.</HI> Much Guilding, and Car|ving; the fir&s;t, upon Leather,
<PB N="67" REF="38">with which they hang many of their Rooms, both above and below Stairs, and cover Chairs; and al&s;o guild their Window-Shutters: Their Carving is in Stone at the Front of their Hou&s;es. And &s;o much for the
<HI>Hague,</HI> where we &s;taid a great while, and where we could hard|ly ever be tyr'd or cloy'd with abiding.</P>
<P>I have been the more Parti|cular in giving an Account of this Place, and of every Thing that is remarkable in it, becau&s;e 'tis &s;o very much talked of by all Travellers in general. I had like to have omitted a Hou&s;e (belonging to the Illu&s;trious Hou&s;e of <HI>Na&s;&s;aw,</HI> built by Prince <HI>Frederick, Henry,</HI> King <HI>William</HI>'s Grand-Father,) call'd <HI>Ry&s;wick,</HI> not far from the <HI>Hague,</HI> which
<PB N="68" REF="39">we were &s;o curious to take a view of; 'tis a very good Piece of Building, all Front, with a &s;patious Court before it, the Cie|ling richly Guilt, and the Chim|ney-Pieces, except two or three, which are Marble, with Pillars of the &s;ame; Floors of black and white Marble; good Gar|dens, but neglected.</P>
<P>And now having re&s;olv'd to take our leave of the <HI>Hague,</HI> we went on board the <HI>Trecht Schuyt,</HI> or Pa&s;&s;age-Boat, which is very large, and will con|tain between thirty and forty People, cover'd with a Tarpau|lin, (a Piece of Canvas dipt in Tar, or Oil,) which in wet Wea|ther keeps out the Rain, and in hot the Sun; which is to be thrown up, to let in the Air when they plea&s;e; a &s;ingle Hor&s;e <PB N="69" REF="39">draws this Ve&s;&s;el, rid by a Boy, who has a long &s;lender Rope fa&s;ten'd to his Geers, and runs, or rather trots along upon the Dykes or Banks, three Miles, or a League an Hour con&s;tantly, &s;tays for no Body, but puts off every Hour, ju&s;t as the Clock has done &s;triking; the Fare is very rea&s;onable; this way of Travelling from Town to Town is very convenient, and tends mightily to the advancement of Commerce, and di&s;patch of Bu|&s;ine&s;s, or Vi&s;its. When you are upon the&s;e Canals on which the&s;e Boats float, you ca&s;t your Eyes from the Water as from a Precipiece down to the Land, for &s;o much higher is the Wa|ter in the&s;e Countries than the Land, which chiefly con&s;i&s;ts of Mar&s;hes, full of Mills, of &s;eve|ral <PB N="70" REF="40">&s;orts, the mo&s;t that we ever &s;aw flying in our lives; the Pro|&s;pect is plea&s;ant: The
<HI>Dutch</HI> are great Improvers of Land, and Planters of Trees, of Ornament as well as Profit.</P>
<P>In our Way to <HI>Leyden</HI> we pa&s;t <HI>Voorbroock,</HI> and
<HI>Woor&s;conack,</HI> two &s;mall Villages; and &s;everal Country-Hou&s;es, belonging to Gentlemen, or rich Citizens, made plea&s;ant with Rows of Trees, and fine Walks before them.</P>

<PB N="71" REF="40">and four are of Stone,) and lo&s;es it &s;elf in the Sand, where endeavours have been, to no purpo&s;e, us'd to make a Sea-Port; 'tis but &s;even Miles from <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> and twenty one from <HI>Am&s;terdam; Leyden</HI> is &s;aid, by &s;ome, to be the Eye, by others, the Garden of

<P>From hence we went by Wa|ter to <HI>HAERLEM,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Haerlem.</NOTE> twelve Miles farther, a large and fine City in this Province; 'tis &s;eated near a <PB N="104" REF="57">Lake of that Name, a League off the Sea, and four from <HI>Leyden,</HI> with which it has Communica|tion by a Canal made <HI>Anno</HI> 1656.

Within it is beau|tified with fine Piazza's, a good (tho' old) Town-Hou&s;e, (the wor&s;t in all this Province) and many other Publick Edifices. Pope <HI>Paul</HI> the Fifth, at the Re|que&s;t of <HI>Philip</HI> the Second King of <HI>Spain,</HI> made it a Bi&s;hop's See, &s;uffragan to the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>&V;trecht. Anno</HI>
1347 it was al|mo&s;t reduced to A&s;hes, but &s;oon after re-built much more &s;tately than ever. In the Year 1572 the Inhabitants &s;hoke off the
<HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Yoke and Religion toge|ther, <PB N="105" REF="57">and embraced the Re|formed.

<P>Here they brew good Beer, which is &s;ent to <HI>Frie&s;land</HI> by Sea, which puts it into a new fer|ment, and by that means makes it much better, and more pala|table; as our <HI>Hull</HI> Ale is when brought to

<P>After having &s;een all that was Rare and Curious, and diverted our &s;elves as long as we thought fit, to which End we &s;par'd nei|ther Money nor Time, we re|&s;olv'd to leave this Place, and advance towards
<HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> which we did, and &s;o for &s;ix Stivers apiece we took the Pa&s;|&s;age Boat, and when we were come half way, we &s;tept out of that, to go into another, and then we &s;aw a &s;tately Hou&s;e, where the Lords, call'd <HI>Dyk|graves,</HI> meet, and &s;it, to take Care of, and Repair the Sea and Land Dykes, or Banks; each has his Appartment provided for him.

Here we met with a very plea&s;ant and remarkable Story, from an elderly <HI>Dutch</HI> Man, who enter|tain'd us with it, till we almo&s;t got to our Journey's end for that Night. 'Twas thus; An eminent Farrier that liv'd near this Place, having an Apprentice that was &s;o very dull and &s;tu|pid, that he could not, after &s;ome Years teaching, do any <PB N="102" REF="61">manner of Thing relating to his Profe&s;&s;ion; the Ma&s;ter being unea&s;ie, and unwilling to keep a Servant, that eat up his Bread, but did him no Service, one day brought him before the Burgo-Ma&s;ters, or chief Magi&s;trates of <HI>Haerlem,</HI> and de&s;ir'd that he might be di&s;charged from him, urging that he was &s;o great a Blockhead, that he could not make a Hor&s;e-Shooe Nail, much le&s;s a Hor&s;e-Shooe, or &s;et it on either: The Magi&s;trates ask'd the Fellow what he could &s;ay for him&s;elf again&s;t what his Ma|&s;ter alledged; he replied, That he was above that Trade; upon which, his Ma&s;ter being ask'd by the Magi&s;trates concerning the Youth's Birth and Parentage, declared, that he was a mere Scoundrel, and that he took him <PB N="113" REF="61">in pure Charity, his Father and Mother were Labouring Peo|ple, and but a little better than Beggars: Then the Magi|&s;trates ask'd the Fellow what he meant; he an&s;wer'd, That he could drain <HI>Haerlem-meer</HI> ea&s;ier than make a Hor&s;e-Shooe; at which the Burgo-Ma&s;ters (think|ing it next to Impo&s;&s;ible) laught; however, they di&s;charg'd his Ma&s;ter, and took the Young&s;ter in private, and examin'd him clo&s;ely, and finding he had a Mathematical Head, they told him, they would advance a good Summ of Money, and &s;et him at work; which they did, and when he had compleated his Engines, he fixt them, and in a &s;hort time recover'd a great deal of dry Land; the Fame of which brought great Numbers <PB N="114" REF="62">of People of all Qualities, and Profe&s;&s;ions, to &s;ee this mighty En|gineer; and being told the for|mer part of the Story, they were &s;urpris'd: The Money be|ing expended, the Operator attended the Magi&s;trates, and gave them an Account of it, and told them, he could not go on, except they would advance him more Money; which they (being mere
<HI>Mamoni&s;ts</HI>) refus'd to do; upon which he cunning|ly drew off the Work-men, and in the Night de&s;troy'd the be&s;t Engine, (in which the great Secret lay, and which was made in Private by his Hand alone) and pull'd out &s;ome Pins out of others, and in a very &s;hort &s;pace of Time laid the whole Land under Water as it was before; away he fled to <HI>Antwerp,</HI> getting
<PB N="115" REF="62">far enough out of the reach of his Employers, who now (tho' too late) began to be &s;en&s;ible of their Stingine&s;s, and would have given double the Summ to have had their Engineer again; however, to obtain their End, having heard where he was (by a Letter he &s;ent to a Friend at
<HI>Haerlem,</HI>) they made fre&s;h Ap|plication to him, and new Offers, which he &s;lighted; then they made u&s;e of Stratagems and Slights to get him away private|ly and by force; which failing, they addre&s;s'd the Governor (a
<HI>Spaniard,</HI> then in open War again&s;t the <HI>States</HI>) to &s;end him back; who, calling him before him, examin'd the Lad about the Affair, and finding how ba&s;ely the Magi&s;trates had dealt with him, and what an ingenious <PB N="116" REF="63">Fellow he was, refus'd to gratifie them; then they attempted by new, large, and more generous Offers, to gain him to come vo|luntarily to them; to which at la&s;t he con&s;ented, and being upon his Journey to <HI>Haerlem,</HI> fell &s;ick of a Fever, and &s;o died by the way, and with him died al&s;o that mighty and matchle&s;s Project; &s;ince which they have not been able to do any thing in that Matter, the Water of that

<P>This va&s;t City was at fir&s;t but a &s;mall Ca&s;tle, and call'd
<HI>Am&s;tel,</HI> taking its Name from the River upon which it was built, and gave Title to the <PB N="118" REF="64">Lords the Founders. Soon after the Inhabitants encreas'd, and apply'd them&s;elves to Fi&s;hing, and were contented to live in thatched Cottages; this Employ|ment begat a Trade among&s;t their Nighbours, and mighti|ly enrich'd them&s;elves; &s;o that the Happine&s;s and Commodiou&s;|ne&s;s of their Situation invited a greater Number of People to come thither, to re&s;ide there; which, from a &s;mall and con|temptible Village, &s;oon made it a very con&s;iderable Town. <HI>Anno</HI>
1235 they had certain Immunities granted them by <HI>Florentius</HI> the Fourth; after this they be|gan to build 'em Bridges and Towers; the Inhabitants al&s;o built new Hou&s;es in the Neigh|bourhood, and then the Borough began to take upon it the Name <PB N="119" REF="64">of the City of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> which was then united to the Country of <HI>Holland,</HI> and having receiv'd new and greater Privileges, which were confirm'd by &s;ucceeding Princes, they by their Trade and Indu&s;try became very Potent; tho' as yet this City had no Walls but only a Pali&s;ado until <HI>Anno</HI> 1482. It &s;urrender'd to
<HI>William</HI> of <HI>Na&s;&s;aw,</HI> after a tedi|ous and ob&s;tinate Siege. Thus in length of Time, is this incon|&s;iderable Place become the mo&s;t celebrated <HI>Emporium</HI> of the Uni|ver&s;e, vying with the greate&s;t Cities in the World, in the great number of its Ships, and the con|veniency it has of fitting them out; it now drives the greate&s;t part of the Commerce which was formerly carried on by tho&s;e ancient and renown'd Ci|ties, <PB N="120" REF="65"><HI>Antwerp, Sevil,</HI> and <HI>Lisbon:</HI>

<P>The fir&s;t thing we took no|tice of in this mighty and va&s;t
<PB N="122" REF="66">City, that was remarkable, was the manner of their laying their Foundations, on which they build all their Hou&s;es, both great and &s;mall, private and publick, which is thus; Above fifty or &s;ixty lu&s;ty Fellows, with a pon|derous Engine of Bra&s;s or Iron, force into the Ground a great many Ma&s;ts, (which occa&s;ions a Saying among them, <HI>That their City &s;tands upon Ma&s;ts, and lives by Ma&s;ts,</HI> meaning their Ship|ping,) upon which they build; the Earth is Boggy, Muddy at top, and a pretty way, but San|dy lower, and their Hou&s;es are firm, and &s;ecure, and &s;tand as long as any other, tho' reckon'd better founded.

'tis too dark, which is a great defect in Architecture; 'tis all of Free-Stone of the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Order, beautified with Bra&s;s-Statues, and Marble Carvings, done by the greate&s;t Ma&s;ters of the Age. it is 282 Feet wide, 232 Feet deep, and 116 Feet high, be&s;ides the Cupolo 50 Feet high, which is a very hand&s;om one, and a great Ornament; in it is a good &s;ett of Bells, which ring not out like ours, but are made to chime.</P>

They are very jealous of the new e&s;tabli&s;h'd Bank in <HI>England,</HI> and oppo&s;e its Intere&s;ts as much as they can, for it draws abun|dance of their Profits away from thence; they have vi&s;ibly de|clin'd, &s;ince that was &s;et up, the Great Intere&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> Eight <HI>per Cent.</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> give, encou|rag'd the Foreigners to &s;end Commi&s;&s;ions for Sub&s;criptions; and it being a Parliamentary Security, they e&s;teem it Sacred,

The&s;e Com|mi&s;&s;ioners compound for the Debtors, and oblige their Cre|ditors to be &s;atisfied with what can be done, and &s;uffer them not to hurry them away to Pri|&s;on, to lie and rot, (as &s;ome <HI>Barbarians</HI> let their Debtors in other places,) but receive part of their Debts, and remain con|tented till the Man be able to pay the re&s;t, who has a part of his E&s;tate left to begin the World again, that is, to go to Trade again, who often by his Indu&s;try, and good Fortune, gets a great E&s;tate, and paies every Body to a Farthing. This is Conduct, this is Management, this is Prudence to be prais'd: But when will the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Na|tion be &s;o happy to imitate them in this? Truly, I fear, never. <PB N="133" REF="71">There need be no <HI>Mint, White-Friers, Savoy,</HI> or other <HI>Sanctua|ries,</HI> if they were put in practice; there need not, I &s;ay, be &s;o ma|ny &s;tarving in all the Holes and Corners of the Town, who are capable of employing their Time well, and getting of Money, and have as good Heads, and as able Bodies, and are as fit for all &s;orts of Bu&s;ine&s;s, as any People in the World: The
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are more Mercurial than the <HI>Dutch,</HI> but their National Con&s;titutions are not &s;o adapted for the Good of each Individual.</P>
<P>Here the chief Officers for Go|vernment of the Ho&s;pitals meet, and manage all Affairs relating to them very prudently. Here are Chambers belonging to the Secretaries, and others, too ma|ny and too long to de&s;cribe;
<PB N="134" REF="72">with a proper Motto or Devize over each; as particularly that over the Chamber of the Com|mi&s;&s;ions of Bankrupts, is cut in Marble,
<HI>Fortune</HI> flying away with Wings, Money-Che&s;ts turn'd up-&s;ide down, Mice and Rats eating Bags, Pens, and Pa|per-Books.</P>
<P>Here is a great Magizine of Arms kept for the City's Safety and Service, all neatly kept, and pre&s;erv'd in Pre&s;&s;es; they told us they could arm, in four Hours time, twenty thou&s;and Men compleatly for Action At the top of this great Hou&s;e are eight great Ci&s;terns, always kept full of Water, to be ready on all Occa&s;ions, with Pipes of Leather to communicate them to all Parts of this Building, if any Fire &s;hould happen; and
<PB N="135" REF="72">the Chimneys we &s;aw were all &s;ecur'd by Copper within, to prevent even the Sut taking fire; and the&s;e great Precautions are us'd, not only becau&s;e of the va&s;t Trea&s;ure, and Accompts lodged here, but becau&s;e their old <HI>Stadthou&s;e,</HI> which was but an ordinary Piece to this, was by accident &s;uddenly reduced to A&s;hes.</P>
<P>This is one of the mo&s;t popu|lous and beautiful Cities in the World; their Buildings are no|ble, large, and magnificent; their Streets broad, (no croud|ing there for the Wall, as at <HI>Lon|don,</HI>) clean, (even to the wea|ring of Slippers in Winter,) and neatly paved with <HI>French</HI> Peble, in Sand, which drinks up, and laid high, which throws off the Water into their Canals, <PB N="136" REF="73">which are very large, and nu|merous here, cleans'd by the daily ebbing and flowing of the Tide, and deep enough to bear Lighters of Burden, which un|lade their Ships, and bring up the Merchandi&s;e to their very Doors; between their Hou&s;es are mo&s;t plea&s;ant Rows of Trees, and Lamps between them, and very thick, (one to two Dwel|lings,) which in Night give a delightful Pro&s;pect, and burn late, to an&s;wer the Ends of Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, or Conver&s;ation: The&s;e, as well as the Trees, are pre|&s;erv'd with great Care, and he's a hardy Fellow that dares break the Gla&s;s of one, or the Boughs of t'other, and is &s;ure of &s;evere Puni&s;hment, which they never fail to admi&s;ter; and, to terrifie the Youth, and the Mob, they <PB N="137" REF="73">have in &s;everal Places &s;et up on a Board painted neatly; <HI>The Ex|ecutioner whipping &s;ome, and cut|ting off the Hands of others for tho&s;e Crimes;</HI> which, by this means, are rarely heard of.</P>
<P>Here is neither Court, nor Univer&s;ity, yet wonderfully a|bounds with People, of mo&s;t Nations; a great many Travel|lers always, pa&s;&s;ing and re-pa&s;|&s;ing; 'tis a mighty Thorow|fair.</P>
<P>We walk'd round the Walls of this City, which are &s;trong with Ba&s;tions, of modern Forti|fication of Earth, faced with Brick, built
<HI>Anno</HI> 1660, forty or fifty Whole and Half-Can|non mounted on Carriages; the Points flank one another, with a very large deep Ditch or Ca|nal round three parts of it; the <PB N="138" REF="74">fourth being &s;ecur'd by an Arm of the Sea, &s;even &s;trong beauti|ful Gates, and &s;everal Guard-Hou&s;es, &s;ixteen hundred Soldi|ers in con&s;tant pay, cloathed and maintain'd by the City, who&s;e Livery they wear, which is Grey Cloth lined, and faced with Green; four hundred do Duty every Night. 'Tis rare to hear of any Di&s;orders com|mitted here in the Nitht-time, notwith&s;tanding the great num|ber and variety of Inhabitants and Strangers, and their conti|nual Fiddling, all Night long, and Gaming, which they do ve|ry much here; no Quarrels, no Heads broke, no Watch-Men &s;cour'd, or A&s;&s;ailants knock'd down; no Swords drawn, no &s;ending to the <HI>Counter,</HI> to lodge there all Night; no breaking
<PB N="139" REF="74">of Windows, pulling down of Signs, and Barber's Poles, (man|ly Acts indeed!) no, not the lea&s;t Mi&s;chief done (at lea&s;t &s;eldom;) if Drunk, they reel quietly home, and ha&s;ten to Bed to &s;leep it away; Robberies Nocturnal are rare, the Clapper-Men (as they call them) go a|bout every half Hour, and make a Noi&s;e with their Rattles, and tell the Time of the Night, and trouble no Body with a <HI>Whither go ye?</HI> or, a
<HI>Come before the Con|&s;table,</HI> and be ask'd twenty &s;illy impertinent Que&s;tions. Indeed the Hou&s;es here are made very &s;trong, abundance of Iron-work for Ornament and Safety, Shut|ters within and without, ve|ry thick, and with &s;trong Bolts, all neatly painted, to the very Garrets, with Green, Red and <PB N="140" REF="75">White, which look very pret|ty.</P>
<P>We went into the new great Church, built by the <HI>Reform'd;</HI> here is the <HI>bigge&s;t Organ</HI> we ever &s;aw, and plaies &s;o very fine, that you would almo&s;t &s;wear there were human Voices; nor did we ever &s;ee &s;uch a Pulpit in the World as there is in another great Church, built broad at the lower part, and &s;o up like a Pyramid, all very curiou&s;ly car|ved; then the Bra&s;s Skreen of mighty Bars, and <HI>de Rutter</HI>'s (their Renown'd Admirals) Mo|nument, erected at the States Charge, which co&s;t two thou|&s;and Pounds Sterling; never was the Life of &s;o great a Man &s;o tamely and weakly thrown away, for he was &s;ent to a&s;&s;i&s;t the

<PB N="142" REF="76">
<P>Here are but thirteen Churches in this va&s;t City, but then they are very large ones, much big|ger than ours in <HI>England,</HI> but no where &s;o numerous; the&s;e all belong to the <HI>Calvini&s;ts,</HI> or <HI>Reform'd Dutch Presbyterians;</HI> &s;ome of which we were in Com|pany with, and found them ve|ry hone&s;t, moderate, good Men, not &s;o hot and fiery as our own; they laugh'd at us for being &s;o very zealous for, and &s;peaking &s;o high of the Church of <HI>En|gland;</HI> but we told them they had no rea&s;on, for we under|&s;tood they were as zealous for the Church of <HI>Holland,</HI> and would &s;uffer none but the Mem|bers of that to come into the Civil Government, which was a good way to pre&s;erve it; which they own'd: And we added,
<PB N="143" REF="76">that if the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were as wi&s;e in that very Particular, they would be a happy Nation; but, as the Intere&s;ts and Factions &s;way'd at Court, &s;o were the Church-men either valu'd or &s;lighted, taken into, or thrown out of Place, and that this &s;hift|ing and changing of Per&s;ons, and fluctuating of Councils, was very pernicious to the true In|tere&s;t of the Nation, and that the only means to keep the Go|vernment &s;teddy, and un&s;haken, was to fill all the Civil Employ|ments of Tru&s;t, Profit, and Ho|nour, with &s;ound Members of the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Church of
<HI>En|gland,</HI> who were the only Men that could and would &s;upport Monarchy and Epi&s;copacy, the be&s;t Church and Government in the World.</P>
<PB N="144" REF="77">
<P>Here are two <HI>French</HI> Churches, one of 'em has been lately en|larged above a third part, 'tis well Wain&s;coted, and has a &s;mall plain Wain&s;cot Organ.</P>
<P>Here is one <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Church, to which we went the fir&s;t Sun|day after our arrival, it was for|merly a Popi&s;h Chapel; it has yet a Nunnery adjoyning to it, we &s;aw &s;ome of the neat Nuns: Here is &s;orry Preaching, a long, dull, tedious Sermon, an hour and three quarters, about two hundred Auditors, and &s;ome|times four or five hundred, all
<HI>Presbyterians.</HI></P>
<P>The King of <HI>England</HI> has a Con&s;ul here, who makes &s;ome &s;mall Figure, and &s;its in an emi|nent Pew in the Church, and has &s;ome Re&s;pect paid him.</P>
<PB N="145" REF="77">
<P>Here is al&s;o one <HI>High-Dutch</HI> Church, or <HI>German;</HI> the&s;e are all allow'd the U&s;e of Bells, and their Mini&s;ters are paid by the Magi&s;trates, as are their own, about 200 Pounds Sterling <HI>per Annum;</HI> &s;ome more, &s;ome le&s;s, be&s;ides Pre&s;ents of Spices, and other Things, they receive once a Year, <HI>viz.</HI> at
<HI>Chri&s;tmas.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> are ve|ry numerous here, as al&s;o in the Towns and Villages in this and other Provinces; they have in this City alone four&s;core and five Chapels or Ma&s;s-Rooms, have no Bells allow'd 'em, are oblig'd to have their Doors al|ways open, and are tolerated, as all others are here; they have a large Square of Hou&s;es for their Religious to live, but not to be cloi&s;ter'd up in, who have a <PB N="146" REF="78">Liberty to go, or &s;tay at Plea|&s;ure; and to live &s;ingly, or to be married, which they like be&s;t.</P>
<P>Great Numbers of <HI>Lutherans</HI> are here, and have a very fine Church; and <HI>Jews</HI> in abundance, who have many Streets here, and two Synagogues; one a ve|ry fine one, and the large&s;t in <HI>Europe</HI> (if not in the World) being much Superior to tho&s;e we our &s;elves &s;aw in many o|ther Parts, where the <HI>Jews</HI> are mo&s;t numerous; in the Yards they have large Schools to edu|cate their Children, and in&s;truct them in the Principles of their Religion, and to learn the <HI>Ho|ly Language,</HI> as the
<HI>Hebrew</HI> is call'd.</P>
<P>Here are <HI>Armenians, Browni&s;ts,</HI> or <HI>Engli&s;h Independents, Anabap|ti&s;ts,</HI> <PB N="147" REF="78">and <HI>Quakers,</HI> but not very many of the la&s;t: We were at all their Conventicles, and heard
'em mouth out their Noi&s;e and Non&s;en&s;e, much again&s;t our Humour, but when we were once in, we thought 'twould be indecent to go out till all was over; they are very Zealous and Furious, and thunder out &s;trange &s;ort of rattling incohe|rent Stuff; we pittied their Ig|norance, but found they retain the &s;ame Heat abroad as at home. All the&s;e Di&s;&s;enters from the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Church of <HI>Hol|land,</HI> mu&s;t be fir&s;t married by the Magi&s;trates, and afterwards, if they will, among them&s;elves after their own Mode: But, as I &s;aid before, they take care to exclude all the&s;e
<HI>Puritan</HI> Pre|tenders out of their Civil Go|vernment,
<PB N="148" REF="79">but they may go in|to their Military, by Sea, or by Land, and be knock'd on the Head, if they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Here are three great Sluces, and Bridges almo&s;t without number, which were formerly of Wood, but are now of good Stone, with very &s;trong, and neat Iron-work, not only of great Conveniency for Commu|nication betwixt Street and Street, but al&s;o of great Beau|ty and Ornament. They are apt in Lazine&s;s (which is not commmon) to throw their Filth into their Burghals, or Canals, which cau&s;es ill Scents and Fumes, and which is a na&s;ty thing, but
'tis prohibited, and puni&s;h'd when di&s;cover'd.</P>
<P><HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> is the World's Ware-Hou&s;e, for here are va&s;t <PB N="149" REF="79">Magazines of all &s;orts of Mer|chandi&s;e; hither are brought Goods from all Parts of the di&s;|cover'd Globe, and here they are laid up for a Market, and when ever they are in demand, hence they are &s;ent forth: Here is the great and general Store-Hou&s;e for Corn, of which, tho' they have but little grows in their own Country, yet they &s;erve their Neighbours with it, and are great Dealers, &s;ome of their Merchants trading only in this Commodity are &s;aid to be worth above a hundred thou&s;and Pounds Sterling; they &s;upply the Armies when in Campaign, and make great Advantage thereby, as al&s;o by the Exchange of Monies: Here are al&s;o al|ways va&s;t Stores of Provi&s;ions of War, for the Sea and Land <PB N="150" REF="80">Service, Arms, Powder, Ball, Buff-Coats, Belts, Match, Ship-Timber, Iron-Works, Ma&s;ts, Pitch, Tar, Hemp, Canvas, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Then for Spices, with which they &s;erve all <HI>Europe,</HI> and part of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> which formerly was done by the <HI>Venetians,</HI> but now by the Dutch <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Com|pany; &s;urely 'tis not the Fate of Commonwealths only to be Ma&s;ters of &s;uch mighty Com|merce!</P>
<P>We hir'd a Yacht, and &s;ail'd up and down the River before the City, to view that and their Shipping, which lie before it in the Form of a Half-Moon, and look like a Wood; they have abundance of &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els con|tinually &s;ailing to and fro; we went to <HI>Sardam,</HI> a great Village
<PB N="151" REF="80">about a League off, where we &s;aw on the Stocks almo&s;t a hun|dred Sail of Ships, all for the Merchants Service; they under|work and under-&s;ell all their Neighbour-Nations, who us'd to come hither to buy Ships, which they could con&s;iderably cheaper than at home; they are very &s;light, ill-built Ships, like other things for &s;ale.</P>
<P>Here are Mills of many &s;orts, almo&s;t without number, chiefly to &s;aw Timber for Ships; &s;ome to make Paper; the People are &s;ubtil and very rich, live &s;paring|ly on Butter-Milk, Whey, with Herbs and pickled Herrings, and Rye-Bread; &s;ome great Mer|chants live here; others In&s;urers, but mo&s;t Ship-Builders and Ship-Carpenters: Their Hou&s;es are very ordinary, and built of <PB N="152" REF="81">Wood; two or three Churches, one ordinary, one new built of Brick; t'other lately enlarg'd, for the Inhabitants encrea&s;e. Here they build Ships of War upon occa&s;ion, having abundance of Hands, and can run 'em up pre&s;ently: Here we &s;aw &s;ome few Beggars, and except &s;ome Foreigners (mo&s;t <HI>French</HI>) at <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> we met with no Beg|gars in all our Travels in the&s;e Provinces: The Natives chu&s;e to be Out-liers, rather than come to <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> where they &s;hall have Bread, but they mu&s;t work for it. In our return we took notice of the va&s;t number of their Shipping, their <HI>Greenland</HI> Fleet makes a great &s;how, being about &s;ix or &s;even hundred Sail, which breeds abundance of Sea|men, and employs abundance <PB N="153" REF="81">of Shipping, but is not very gainful to the Adventurer, for they often make bad Voiages, killing but a few Whales; the very Ships &s;tinks of their Oil, &s;o we ea&s;ily found them out. When we came a&s;hoar, we walk'd along their Keys or Wharfs, and view'd the Shipping that way, they were numerous indeed, that part of their Fleet which lies here con&s;i&s;ts of about fifty Sail, great and &s;mall, &s;everal new ones on the Stocks; they are now hard at work to get them ready, and to rig the re&s;t, to be early at Sea next Spring: The <HI>States</HI> have here a great Magazine for the Navy, and all things in great order, and well pre&s;erv'd.</P>
<P>We &s;aw the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Com|panies Magazine, con&s;i&s;ting of Ware-Hou&s;es, and Cellars, where <PB N="154" REF="82">are va&s;t Quantities of Spices of all &s;orts, (the wor&s;t and olde&s;t of which they &s;ell fir&s;t, and &s;end to their Neighbours, Callico's, Silks,

The Dutch <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company has a Sovereign Power and great Privileges granted them by the <HI>States-General,</HI> are very Politick in their Conduct, and Diligent in their Application, and aim not at the making them&s;elves and Families, but the Company Great; look to Futurity, and con&s;ider the Con&s;equences of Things; they have tran&s;lated the <HI>Bible</HI> and <HI>Te&s;tament</HI> in the <PB N="156" REF="83"><HI>Indian</HI> Language, and pretend to be good Chri&s;tians, by endea|vouring to plant and cultivate the Go&s;pel among the <HI>Indians,</HI> (their conquer'd Va&s;&s;als,) but prove them&s;elves very indif|ferent (indeed not good Mora|li&s;ts) in their Negotiations with the Engli&s;h

<P>They have a mighty Country in extent in <HI>India,</HI> and have built a great and beautiful City, and call'd it <HI>Batavia,</HI> have for|tified it like <HI>Am&s;terdam.</HI> At that Place re&s;ides the General of the <HI>Indies,</HI> their chief Officer, who has Guards of Hor&s;e and
<PB N="157" REF="83">Foot, Court and State-Officers, Privy-Councellors,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> Power to conclude Peace, or denounce War, and looks much like (tho' he be not) a Sovereign Prince. They are po&s;&s;e&s;t of <HI>Bantam,</HI> and other Parts of the I&s;land of <HI>Ja|va,</HI> are con&s;iderable in the

<HI>Dutch</HI> don't love to hear of; tho' 'tis an old Story, yet 'tis a very true one, and, I think, <PB N="159" REF="84">one of the Cruele&s;t that was ever heard of.</P>
<P>We took a view of both the Hou&s;es belonging to the Dutch
<HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company in <HI>Am&s;ter|dam;</HI> one is the old, t'other the new Part of the City: Here they keep their General Courts of Sales, and Committees meet to di&s;patch their Affairs; there are abundance of Chambers and Offices, in one are the Trophies which they have gain'd from the
<HI>Indian</HI> Princes whom they have vanqui&s;h'd. We were led into a Room, and gratified with the &s;ight of abundance of Am|ber greece, Musk, Tea, and other rich Drugs; and into another where were great quantities of Cinamon, Mace, Cloves, and Nutmegs, brought from their Magazines, and making here fit
<PB N="160" REF="85">for Sale, by &s;orting, as al&s;o min|cing of them: Abundance of other Rooms and Appartments we &s;aw, too many and too long to particularize. It &s;hall &s;uffice that we pre&s;ent you with a ve|ry fine and remarkable Story, told us ju&s;t as we were taking leave, and &s;tanding under the Gate. A Private Centinel that carried a Musket, and went hence in the Companies Service to <HI>Battavia,</HI> having &s;ignaliz'd him&s;elf by his Bravery in many Actions, was advanc'd to the Se|cond Command in tho&s;e Parts, had Guards, a large Retinue, and liv'd wondrous Great, flou|ri&s;h'd for a time, but in the &s;pace of a few Years was reduced to extream Poverty, and became a very Sot; being unea&s;ie in <HI>In|dia,</HI> he return'd to
<HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> <PB N="161" REF="85">and having &s;pun out &s;ome time, and could get no Employment, once more took a Musket on his Shoulder, and went away for <HI>Battavia</HI> to try his Fortune a &s;e|cond time, (which &s;eldom fa|vours the Aged, but u&s;ually is lavi&s;h of her Graces to the Youth|ful and the Gay;) but what be|came of this Gentleman in this Second Adventure, we were not inform'd; but by this Story we took notice of the great Incer|tainty and Mutability of all Sub|lunary Things.</P>
<P>We were &s;everal times on the <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> Exchange, which is much crowded, and which a|bounds with Bu&s;ine&s;s, and great Merchants, (many of which, by great Lo&s;&s;es, have gone off this War,) who corre&s;pond to and with all Parts of the di&s;cover'd <PB N="162" REF="86">World: This Building is oblong, of Brick and Stone, far &s;hort in Beauty and Magnificence of the <HI>Royal-Exchange</HI> at <HI>London,</HI> (tho' as capacious,) being an old Pile; has no Shops round about it a|bove, as ours, nor about it be|low, only &s;ome few incon&s;idera|ble Toy-&s;hops at one end above Stairs. The Merchants here take great freedom of talking of and cen&s;uring all the Actions of all the Sovereign Princes in the World, and ob&s;erve no <HI>decorum</HI> in their Expre&s;&s;ions, for which they are much to blame, as we told &s;ome of our Acquaintance, who thereupon furni&s;h'd us with an agreeable and remarkable Story of a <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant, who on this <HI>Exchange</HI> talk'd very freely of one of the le&s;&s;er (tho' Sovereign) Princes of <HI>Germany,</HI> <PB N="163" REF="86">and &s;peaking meanly and con|temptible of him, (his Envoy <HI>in|cognito</HI> being pre&s;ent, took no|tice of it, ask'd his Name pri|vately, and &s;et it down in his Pocket-Book,) it hapned not long after, this very Negotiator had Bu&s;ine&s;s in that very Prince's Country, and being curious to &s;ee the Court, was met there by the Envoy who heard his foul Language again&s;t his Ma&s;ter on the <HI>Am&s;terdam-Exchange,</HI> and who knew him again, who de|manding his Name, found 'twas the &s;ame Man, and ask'd him if he remember'd &s;uch Words; which he endeavour'd to evade, but the Time, Place and Com|pany being told, he was mute; the Envoy told him 'twas now in his Power to ruin him, but he would not do it, but di&s;mi&s;s'd <PB N="164" REF="87">him with this Advice; <HI>Hence|forth Commonwealths Man</HI> (&s;aid he) <HI>have a Care how you treat So|vereign Princes, for the unmanner|ly Freedom you take at home, might have co&s;t you your Life abroad.</HI> Nay, to our knowledge, upon that
<HI>Exchange,</HI> a &s;awcy Ra&s;cal (a Broker) had the Impudence to wi&s;h all the Princes in the World in their <HI>Ra&s;phou&s;e,</HI> or
<HI>Bridewell;</HI> &s;uch Liberty of Speech do the&s;e wanton Republicans take, and are fond of their Chains, <HI>viz.</HI> their heavy Taxes and Impo&s;itions, their Servitude being prodigious, having no|thing but the name of Freedom. The &s;ame irreverent and inde|cent Di&s;cour&s;e they have in their Coffee-Hou&s;es, which is for want of good Sen&s;e and good Man|ners; for in all the Conver&s;ati|on <PB N="165" REF="87">which we had (and which was a great deal, and with the principal Magi&s;trates and States, and Top Traders, who are mere Merchants) both in Private and Publick Hou&s;es, and in our Pa&s;|&s;ages from Place to Place, we met with very few refin'd Heads, (except among&s;t the <HI>States,</HI> who are for the mo&s;t part very prudent, &s;ober, and ci|vil Men, of &s;tanch Reputation and great Integrity, of good Fa|milies, and not rais'd from Pick|led Herrings and Butter-Boxes, as reported by &s;ome untravell'd Sparks,) but two at <HI>Am&s;terdam, viz.</HI> a Poet and a Civilian, who were indeed very witty Men and extraordinary Company, we were often with them, they &s;poke <HI>French</HI> fluently, which is very common here, and, we think, <PB N="166" REF="88">more univer&s;al than <HI>Latin.</HI> Milk-Coffee with Nutmeg, and Coffee with Liquori&s;h infus'd, are much drank by the <HI>Dutch</HI> in tho&s;e Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>The Government of this Re|nown'd City is excellent, the Magi&s;trates wholly attend their Office, and look carefully after the due execution of their Laws, which are the Life and Soul of the Commonwealth: The Ex|ci&s;e, which is here general, would be an in&s;upportable Grievance, and cau&s;e daily Complaints, but that it is fairly e&s;tabli&s;h'd, and faithfully collected. Here is a Senate of thirty &s;ix States men, who continue in that Employ|ment during life, by a Privilege the Citizens have quitted, who in former Times elected them annually; but when their City <PB N="167" REF="88">grew va&s;t, the number of Ele|ctors encreas'd and often fell in|to Tumult; which to prevent they have e&s;tabli&s;h'd that great Council, who fill up their own Vacancies them&s;elves, and chu&s;e the Burgo-Ma&s;ters, and E&s;che|vins, (Lord-Mayors and Alder|men) who are the Chief Magi|&s;trates; of the fir&s;t there are four, one pre&s;ides, and &s;erves two Years, the other three are annually elected: The&s;e great Officers repre&s;ent the Sovereign|ty of the City, and di&s;po&s;e of all the Offices in the Civil Govern|ment, keep the Bank, and the Keys of that and the City Gates, make all I&s;&s;ues and Payments, have the whole Power, and are the &s;ole Judges of what is for the Honour, Safety, and Intere&s;t of this Body Politick; they re|ceive
<PB N="168" REF="89">and entertain Foreign Princes and Amba&s;&s;adors, and perform all the Publick Cere|monies.</P>
<P>There are nine E&s;chevins; of which &s;even are annually elected, the Senate chu&s;es fourteen, and the Stadtholder (King <HI>William</HI>) approves of and confirms &s;even. They are Judges in all Cau&s;es Civil and Criminal, and are Men of great Integrity, of a clear and un&s;potted Reputation; their Pen&s;ions are &s;mall, and their Port, Equipage and Retinue ac|cordingly; they think it a &s;uf|ficient Honour (as well as their Duty) to &s;erve their Country: The Burgo-Ma&s;ters and E&s;che|vins have it in their Power to make their Families, by getting their Sons, Nephews and Friends into Honourable and Profitable <PB N="169" REF="89">Employments. The Schout is a great Officer, like our Sheriff, &s;eizes Criminals, and &s;ecures them, and pre&s;erves the Peace of the City. The Pen&s;ioner is like our Recorder, being Learn'd in the Civil Law, who informs the Senate, Burgo-Ma&s;ters, and E&s;|chevins what are the Laws and Cu&s;toms of the Country, and makes all the Publich Speeches. Trea&s;urers and Under-Officers there are in great number, too tedious to mention. The Go|vernment of the &s;everal Cities of the
<HI>Seven Provinces</HI> is (in a manner) the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Then we went to Vi&s;it their Alms-Hou&s;es, which are nume|rous, and well fill'd, giving Lodging and Diet to above twenty thou&s;and Poor: Thus much may be &s;aid, in pure ju|&s;tice, <PB N="170" REF="90">That the
<HI>Dutch</HI> Charity is very great and exten&s;ive, they are very liberal, they give of|ten, tho' it be but a little at a time; their Collections in their Churches are frequent, and hand|&s;omly manag'd to prevent Re|flections, &s;o gathering the Alms, that one knows not what the t'o|ther gives; the Velvet Pur&s;e or Bag which is handed about be|ing deep and not wide; and to put them in mind to prepare their Coin, a little Bell is fixt to the Stick, to which the Pur&s;e is fa&s;ten'd, and which they &s;end from one to another, through every Pew; Children and Ser|vants always give &s;omething. The&s;e Charity-Hou&s;es are &s;paci|ous, noble, large, and well con|triv'd; we prais'd their Build|ing and Conveniences, and told <PB N="171" REF="90">them, it was our Opinion, Hou&s;es of that kind &s;hould be rather Commodious (as theirs) than Magnificent, which was fitte&s;t for the Palaces of Princes, and not the Ho&s;pitals of the Poor. They have made Provi&s;ion for the old Men and Women toge|ther, and &s;eparately and for Wi|dows by them&s;elves, then for Children of both Sexes, who are numerous, and neatly dre&s;s'd, in party-colour'd Cloth, their up|per Garment half red, half &s;ad|colour; more e&s;pecial Care is taken of Citizens Children; tho' Foundlings, or the I&s;&s;ue of Strangers, are not excluded this Benefit of their Charity.</P>
<P>We &s;aw their <HI>Bedlam,</HI> a very neat old Building, tho' far &s;hort of that in <HI>Moorfields,</HI> but rich in Stock, and indeed not &s;o
<PB N="172" REF="91">full of mad Folks, as the <HI>En|gli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>Here they have a Fool-Hou&s;e, no where el&s;e to be found in the World, not but that there may be as many of that &s;ort of tame Creatures in other Countries; and this may be &s;aid, That how many &s;oever there are without, there are very few within the&s;e Doors: 'Tis a &s;mall old Build|ing, where there is good Lodg|ing and Diet provided for the&s;e unhappy People; among&s;t them there was a Woman that had the lea&s;t Head we ever &s;aw, be|ing much le&s;s than the natural Proportion.</P>
<P>Hence we went to the Ho|&s;pital for Boies and Girls, who&s;e Fathers were Members of the E&s;tabli&s;h'd or National Church: 'tis a good well-built &s;quare <PB N="173" REF="91">Piece, where the Children (while little) are kept clo&s;e to School, then put out Apprentices to Han|dicraft-Trades: Here is an Apo|thecaries, and Shoe-makers Shop, wholly for the Service of this Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Hence to the Spin-Hou&s;e, the Pri&s;on for Whores and Thieves, all were at work, &s;ome making Lace, others Plain-work, &s;ome Spinning, others mending Lin|nen; &s;ome in for Weeks, others Months, and Years, according to their Demerits.</P>
<P>Then to the Ra&s;p-Hou&s;e, which is a <HI>Bridewell,</HI> where are &s;ecur'd tho&s;e who have been near hang|ing, and have e&s;cap'd with burn|ing between the Shoulders with three Cro&s;&s;es, the Arms of
<HI>Am|&s;terdam;</HI> &s;ometimes with a red|hot Sword on their Back, to
<PB N="174" REF="92">&s;hew how narrowly they &s;ay'd their Heads, and to caution 'em to beware of the next Puni&s;h|ment; here, after a &s;evere Whip|ping, they are doom'd to a tem|porary Impri&s;onment, from three to five, &s;even, nine, eleven, and thirty Years, &s;ome to perpetual; all to bodily Labour, to Ra&s;p (which is to cut with a double-teeth'd Saw) fifty Pounds of Bra|zil (a hard Wood for the Dyers u&s;e) every Day, or be drubb'd lu&s;tily with a Bulls Pi&s;&s;el, and if that won't do, they are put into a Dungeon, and fed with Bread and Water; or el&s;e into a clo&s;e dark Vault, into which Water is let, which if they don't empty by pumping, will &s;oon drown 'em, which &s;oon brings 'em to work. The Profits of their La|bour are for their Maintenance, <PB N="175" REF="92">and the Overplus to the Stock of the Hou&s;e, or to be di&s;pos'd of by the <HI>States</HI> for the Publick Good.</P>
<P>Here are al&s;o Hou&s;es for Va|gabonds, or wandering Beggars, common Game&s;ters, Sharpers, Sots and idle Folks, who are kept in this Place at hard work.</P>
<P>Then to the Gaa&s;thou&s;e, where Entertainment is given (at the Publick Charge) to all needy Foreigners, of any Nation, four Days, and as many Nights; in which time they mu&s;t find out their Friends, or get Work to maintain them&s;elves, or el&s;e they &s;hall have Work provided for them by the Officers, which few like, but had rather chu&s;e their own.</P>
<P>Upon the Ju&s;tice-day (as they call the Execution here, which is
<PB N="176" REF="93">u&s;ually Saturday) we &s;aw a Man &s;trangled, which differs but lit|tle, and that in the Word only, from Hanging; it is upon a Scaffold fix'd again&s;t the Stadt|hou&s;e; the Criminal is brought through
<HI>Solomon</HI>'s Hall, where his Sentence is read, as al&s;o on the Stage, then the Par&s;on prays with him, and he by him&s;elf, then mounts a little Cricket, and claps his Back to a Po&s;t &s;et up on purpo&s;e, through which there's a Hole, into which the latter is put, and &s;o twi&s;ted hard about his Neck, the Stool kick'd down, and the Hangman all the while holding his No&s;e, and &s;top|ping his Breath, the &s;ooner to put him out of Pain.</P>
<P>Another was beheaded with a broad Sword, which the Execu|tioner keeps under his Cloak till <PB N="177" REF="93">the Criminal is ready on his Knees, and the Cap over his Eyes, then off goes the Cloak, the Head&s;man approaches, pre|tending to pull the Cap a little more over his Eyes, in half a Minute whips off his Head, and very cleaverly. <HI>Haerlem</HI> fur|ni&s;hes
<HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> with the Execu|tioner; which tho' the bigge&s;t and riche&s;t City in all the <HI>Seven</HI> (as well as this) <HI>Provinces,</HI> yet has not the Privilege to have a Hangman of her own. He is a &s;pruce Fellow, and goes well in Habit, and has Servants to at|tend him, and is u&s;ually by Pro|fe&s;&s;ion a Surgeon, and Bone-&s;et|ter, as well as Bone-Cutter, has a good Sallary from the Towns where he &s;erves, and lives com|fortably, tho' very few are found of his Company, it being thought
<PB N="178" REF="94">the wor&s;t in the World, e&s;pe|cially if he has a Par&s;on with him.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time was a lu&s;ty &s;turdy Fellow whipt for &s;ome le&s;&s;er Roguery, or Cheating, which was done while the t'o|ther Fellow was hanging; and after this manner, he was brought on the Scaffold with his Crime on his Brea&s;t in Capital Letters, and led about, then &s;tript to the Wai&s;t, his Hands tied, and drawn up tight with a Cord to a Po&s;t, then the Hangman took up a good handful of large Birch (like that of O&s;tlers Brooms) from a great Bundle which lay clo&s;e by, and &s;la&s;h'd him as fa&s;t as he could, backwards and for|wards, then took up a fre&s;h hand|ful, and &s;o on for &s;ix or &s;even Minutes; at which time the Ma|gi&s;trates
<PB N="179" REF="94">(who look on out of the <HI>Stadthou&s;e</HI> Windows) nodded to him to give over. Va&s;t was the number of Spectators, (as always is both there and every where el&s;e at &s;uch unplea&s;ant Sights) beyond what we ever &s;aw, and mo&s;t Mob; or <HI>Jean Hagel,</HI> as they call 'em; or
<HI>John Hail,</HI> or <HI>Canalia,</HI> or Canals, Sinks of Filth,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Here are al&s;o proper Hou&s;es to receive, detain, and cha&s;ti&s;e Extravagants, Debo&s;hees, and re|probate, wicked, and lewd Chil|dren; of which having &s;poken pretty largely in the Account of the
<HI>Hague,</HI> we &s;hall &s;ay no more here, but refer our Reader thi|ther for full Satisfaction.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Charity Hou&s;es, as al&s;o tho&s;e of Correction and Re|formation, are neat and &s;pruce, <PB N="180" REF="95">furni&s;h'd with Pictures (which are &s;o common in this Country, that Butchers, Coblers, and the meane&s;t People, have a great ma|ny, and of the &s;ort pretty good) and well &s;et out.</P>
<P>In &s;ome of the&s;e Alms-Hou&s;es there are fourteen or fifteen hundred, in others eight or nine hundred, and in the re&s;t four or five hundred Boys and Girls: Here al&s;o may any Body, Man or Woman, Native or Stranger, have a hand&s;ome Maintenance for their Lives, in a Hou&s;e pro|vided on purpo&s;e, call'd the <HI>Bro|ther's Hou&s;e,</HI> paying only a &s;mall Summ of Money at fir&s;t. The Charity of this renown'd City is very great, even beyond Ex|ample, and above Compari&s;on, they are continually giving to the Poor, hardly a Bargain made <PB N="181" REF="95">here, but they come in for a Snack, the Gods Penny is theirs.</P>
<P>We took a walk in the After|noon out of the City-Gates, to ob&s;erve the Situation and the Country round about. We &s;aw Mills innumerable, all in motion, &s;ome Water, &s;ome Wind, &s;ome Thatch, &s;ome Wood, (few Brick) to grind Colours for the Pot-Hou&s;es, Corn for this City, &s;aw|ing Timber, draining Mar&s;h-Grounds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Here the Land lies low, and the Water high, dam'd up for the Publick Ser|vice, and conveniency of Tra|vel. The Air is thick, foul, and unwhol&s;om; we fortified our &s;elves with a good Do&s;e of old Hock every Day we liv'd, as the better &s;ort of
<HI>Dutch</HI> do, and the common with a Cup of <HI>Nantz.</HI></P>
<PB N="182" REF="96">
<P>We arrived to the <HI>Dooly-Hou&s;e,</HI> a noted Tavern, where many of the Train'd-Band Officers are ve|ry well drawn in good Paint, in a great drinking Rome, the Wine is generally good at their Pub|lick Hou&s;es, but the be&s;t was at the <HI>Heer-Logiment,</HI> but then the Price is higher: This is a noble Hou&s;e, fit to receive and lodge a Prince, as it often does the le&s;&s;er Potentates of <HI>Germany,</HI> who fre|quently travel thither, e&s;pecially in their Minority, when they ne|ver fail to make the Tour of the&s;e Provinces; which well me|rit their Time and Expence, in|forming their Judgments, as well as gratifying their Curio&s;ities: The Accounts and De&s;criptions of Places and Things, well made, being indeed very delightful to read, but much more to view; <PB N="183" REF="96">the Eye being in matters of that kind, much to be prefer'd to the Ear: The mighty Figure this Republick has, and &s;till does make in the World, her Wealth, Power, and Reputation, both at home and abroad; her Nume|rous Armies, Formidable Navies, and Foreign Alliances, are all well worth &s;eeing and know|ing.</P>
<P>'Tis very ob&s;ervable here, more Women are found in the Shops and Bu&s;ine&s;s in general than Men; they have the Conduct of the Pur&s;e and Commerce, and manage it rarely well, they are Careful and Diligent, capable of Affairs, (be&s;ides Dome&s;tick) ha|ving an Education &s;uitable, and a Genius wholly adapted to it. The Men take all the Plea&s;ure, they go to Coffee-Hou&s;es, Ta|verns <PB N="184" REF="97">and Treats, walk or ride in Cha&s;es abroad, play much at Cards, &s;it up Gaming and Fud|ling greate&s;t part of Night; and all is well, the good Wife gets and the Husband &s;pends the Money; but this Compen&s;ation the Woman has for all her Toil and Care, That at her Death (if &s;he drops before her Husband) &s;he can give away half the E|&s;tate. The Women of the&s;e Parts are all for making their Daughters and Nieces, or Grand-Children great Fortunes; they let the Boys &s;hift for them&s;elves, they &s;ay they can be&s;t do it.</P>
<P>We met abundance of <HI>French</HI> in this Place, both Mini&s;ters and others, (mo&s;t of the <HI>Reform'd Religion</HI>) the
<HI>Dutch</HI> are very ge|nerous to them in their Alms for their Support; here are ma|ny <PB N="185" REF="97">Thou&s;ands, ten for one in <HI>England</HI> or
<HI>Ireland.</HI> This Re|mark we made (not once but often,) when we or any others, occa&s;ionally &s;poke again&s;t the <HI>French</HI> King, they &s;eem'd con|cern'd, tho' he has &s;o bitterly per&s;ecuted them; and, as we were inform'd by tho&s;e who knew it well, they us'd to rejoyce at his former Succe&s;&s;es in <HI>Flanders, Pied|mont,</HI> and <HI>Catalina,</HI> and &s;ay up|on all Occa&s;ions, <HI>N&ocirc;tre Grand Monarque e&s;t invincible,</HI> which Note now is chang'd; the <HI>Dutch</HI> were offended at their Vanity and Weakne&s;s, becau&s;e from them they receiv'd their Bread.</P>
<P>We went to the Butter, Chee&s;e, Poultry, and Dog-Market; the three fir&s;t were well-&s;tor'd, but the la&s;t (which is every
<HI>Monday</HI> Morning) had but about twen|ty <PB N="186" REF="98">Curs in it, and tho&s;e very ug|ly, but every Woman mu&s;t have one, the ordinary as well as ex|traordinary, and good round Prizes they, for the&s;e hairy Com|panions.</P>
<P>Thence to the Market for green and dried Herbs, Seeds of all &s;orts, and Roots for Apothe|caries; another of very fine Flowers in Pots, in great quan|tities. Here is a Rag-market, and another for Tobacco, Pipes, of which they have very fine ones, curiou&s;ly glaz'd and wrought, and great variety of Sorts and Prizes, for Sea and Land, &s;hort ones with large Bowls for the Skippers and Tarpaulins, who keep them on board their Ve&s;|&s;els, and &s;ell them to the Pa&s;|&s;engers. Markets of Baskets, Chairs, Tubs, and Pails, all very <PB N="187" REF="98">pretty; Grain, Bisket, Cakes, Eggs,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> Two large Fle&s;h-Markets or Halls, being in hand|&s;ome Hou&s;es, great &s;tore of Fle&s;h in both, and very good, in|differently cheap, and would be very rea&s;onable but for the great and la&s;ting Exci&s;e; the Butchers and their Wives are neatly dre&s;|&s;ed, and cleanlier than ours: Here is al&s;o a Sawcidge, Hogs|face and Tripe-Market; they &s;ell in their Chee&s;emongers Shops <HI>Bologna</HI> Sawcidges, and dried Salmon, both which they dre&s;s well, boiling in part, then fry|ing the fir&s;t, and eating it with Spinage, over which they &s;crape Nutmeg.</P>
<P>We hired a Yacht again, and &s;ailed for &s;everal Hours up and down the River to divert our &s;elves: Upon a &s;mall I&s;land o|veragain&s;t
<PB N="188" REF="99">the City is their &s;tand|ing Gallows, (the Scaffold I mention'd before being &s;et up only at particular times,) all of Free-Stone, Triangular Pillars, with Iron cro&s;s them, with carv'd Work (a Lion) at the top of each; they fir&s;t hang or &s;trangle the Criminals on the fore&s;aid Scaffold erected clo&s;e to the <HI>Stadthou&s;e,</HI> and tho&s;e &s;en|tenced to hang in Iron are brought hither. The Wheel, or Cro&s;s is &s;eldom us'd here, (tho' often in <HI>France.</HI>) The <HI>Scotch</HI> Man that many Years ago attempted to burn their Fleet of Men of War, is here laid upon a Wheel &s;et upon a high Po&s;t. Al&s;o a <HI>French</HI> Man that kill'd a Whore, who being bid by the Par&s;on to pray for the City and Magi|&s;trates, &s;aid,
<HI>The Devil take 'em <PB N="189" REF="99">all;</HI> and one or two more hang|ing in Chains, (as we in <HI>England</HI> call it.)</P>
<P>We had the Curio&s;ity to go to &s;ee the Navy or Admiralty Office, which is a well-built Hou&s;e, with good large Rooms, well painted, and fitly accommo|dated to the Bu&s;ine&s;s; they have a Court of Ju&s;tice within them|&s;elves, from which is no Appeal; they hang or &s;hoot their Sea-Of|ficers, or Men for Cowardize, or neglect of Duty, and reward them roundly if they burn, &s;ink, or take a Flag-Ship, or any Ship of War, great, or &s;mall, or do any con&s;iderable Service; they give them ready Money and Pen|&s;ions when di&s;abled; great Care is taken of their Sea-men, their Wages punctually and ju&s;tly paid, and their Widows and Chil|dren
<PB N="190" REF="100">con&s;ider'd, and them&s;elves largely provided for in Ho&s;pi|tals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In this Hou&s;e are &s;e|veral Trophies hung up, taken from the &s;everal Enemies of this State.</P>
<P>We hir'd each a Chai&s;e (which is a &s;mall Chariot on two Wheels drawn by one Hor&s;e, which runs very &s;wift, the Roads being &s;an|dy and generally good, can tra|vel &s;ixty Miles a day,) and each got a Companion, and went to <HI>NAERDEN,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Naerden.</NOTE> the Frontier of the Province of <HI>Holland,</HI> about ten Miles from <HI>Am&s;terdam;</HI> in our way we pa&s;t through <HI>Muy|den,</HI> a &s;mall City, which has no Vote among the <HI>States,</HI> becau&s;e neither they, nor <HI>We&s;ep,</HI> another &s;mall City, nor <HI>Naerden</HI> &s;ent any Deputies to the <HI>Hague,</HI> when the Foundation of the Union was <PB N="191" REF="100">laid.

1455 it was re-built by <HI>William</HI> the Third of <HI>Bavaia,</HI> then Earl of <HI>Holland.</HI> The Citizens of <HI>&V;trecht</HI> made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of it in the Year 1481, by a pretty Stra|tagem, putting their Soldiers in the Habit of Country Women; who entring the Place on the Market-Day, ea&s;ily took it; but the Inhabitants &s;oon recover'd it, and put them all to the Sword. <HI>Anno</HI> 1486 this Place was re|duced to A&s;hes, and &s;oon re-built; but it met with a &s;everer Fate (at lea&s;t in the Per&s;ons of the Burghers) from <HI>Frederick de To|ledo,</HI> Duke
<HI>D'Alva,</HI> who came be|fore it with a Body of an Army;
<PB N="192" REF="101">upon which &s;ome of the Citi|zens open'd their Gates to let him in; notwith&s;tanding which, he fell upon the Inhabitants and bar|barou&s;ly murder'd them.</P>
<P>It is now a modern Regular Fortification, and made prodigi|ou&s;ly &s;trong, capable of recei|ving a Gari&s;on of eight or ten thou&s;and Men; it was begun <HI>Anno</HI> 1677, and perfected &s;ince the beginning of this War; it co&s;t above three (or rather &s;ix) hundred thou&s;and Pounds Ster|ling. Here are &s;ix Bulwarks, four Ravelins, two Half-Moons, two Gates, and double Ditches, deep, with &s;trong Counter&s;carps.</P>
<P>The Town is but &s;mall and ordinary; but this is the Frontier and principal Security of the whole Province, which is not the riche&s;t only of the Seven, <PB N="193" REF="101">but of the Seventeen. In the Year 1672 the
<HI>French</HI> with Ea&s;e and by Treachery took it; but the Prince of
<HI>Orange</HI> (now King of <HI>England</HI>) re-took it in eight Days time, there being then no Fortification, but what the <HI>French</HI> had thrown up while they po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd it. The <HI>States</HI> depending upon their Armies in the Field, took the le&s;s Care of this Place, now they have made it very for|midable.</P>
<P>Here is a &s;mall Woollen Ma|nufacture; good Beer brew'd, fine, and but little inferior to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in plea&s;antne&s;s of ta&s;te.</P>
<P>We rid round about the Coun|try, which is Downy, almo&s;t like
<HI>Ep&s;om,</HI> the Air pretty whol&s;om, and plea&s;ant: We were at a Country-Hou&s;e of the late Ad|miral <PB N="194" REF="102"><HI>Trump</HI>'s, a pretty Box, fine Gardens, Walks, and Rows of Trees, with a good Moat about it. We pa&s;t by another of his Hou&s;es, which the <HI>French</HI> burnt in the former War, <HI>Anno</HI> 1673 or 1674, much bigger than t'o|ther.</P>
<P>In our return we pa&s;t through <HI>We&s;ep,</HI> a &s;mall and incon&s;iderable City, where they brew good Beer.</P>
<P>The Weather being plea&s;ant we made another Sally from
<HI>Am|&s;terdam,</HI> and vi&s;ited <HI>&V;trecht,</HI> twen|ty &s;even Miles off; we pa&s;t by <HI>Overkirk,</HI> a &s;mall Village, which gives Title to a Lord, a Favourite, and po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of the Revenues hereof. We went through
<HI>Op|cow,</HI> another &s;mall Village, four Miles further; near which Place are the Ruines of an old Ca&s;tle. <PB N="195" REF="102">Then we came to
<HI>Liona,</HI> a great Town, &s;even Miles off: Thence to <HI>New Sluice,</HI> where we din'd upon roa&s;ted Eels, which is very good Victuals, and well dre&s;s'd here, and is always ready at &s;et times for Travellers. A Mile and half further is <HI>Brutil,</HI> a &s;mall Vil|lage, where young <HI>De Rutter</HI> has a Hou&s;e. We pa&s;t <HI>Maer&s;em</HI> and <HI>Soulandt,</HI> two &s;mall Places; and about three in the Afternoon we arriv'd at
<HI>&V;trecht,</HI> a great, po|pulous, but weak City, Capital of the Province of that Name, one of the Seven United, former|ly and Archbi&s;hoprick, in the Circle of <HI>We&s;tphalia,</HI> and Imperi|al, but now &s;ubject to the
<HI>States:</HI> It is &s;eated on a Branch of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> in a very convenient and fruitful Place.</P>
<PB N="196" REF="103">
<P>We walk'd about the Walls, which are pretty high, and of Brick, but weak, and out of re|pair, &s;urrounded with a deep, and broad Ditch; we pa&s;t one of the Gates, and were ferried over to &s;ee the <HI>Pall-Mall,</HI> which is kept very neatly, &s;haded with &s;e|veral Rows of Trees on each &s;ide, pre&s;erv'd by the pre&s;ent <HI>French</HI> King's immediate Command, who was there with his Army <HI>An.</HI> 1673, when he took this City without any Re&s;i&s;tance. Here is an Univer&s;ity (erected by the <HI>States, Anno</HI> 1636,) but not &s;o full as that at <HI>Leyden;</HI> tho' this, in our Opinion, is a plea&s;anter Place, having better Air, and a finer Country about it, for we almo&s;t phan&s;ied our &s;elves in <HI>En|gland,</HI> this being like &s;ome of our old Cities: Here many of the <PB N="197" REF="103">Nobility and Gentry live, be|cau&s;e of the plea&s;antne&s;s of the Place, being as it were a Retire|ment from the noi&s;e and hurry of Bu&s;ine&s;s and Bu&s;tle, con&s;tant in great, trading, populous Places. The better &s;ort of People here affect the <HI>French</HI> Mode, and, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, their way of li|ving; whereas the <HI>Dutch,</HI> in mo&s;t other Parts, are fixt to their Fa|&s;hion, as the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> never changing it.</P>
<P>We had the Curio&s;ity to turn over the Manu&s;cripts lately found out, and now depo&s;ited in the Clerks Hou&s;e, (adjoyning to the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Church) where, be|&s;ides many very ancient Bibles, and other curious Books fairly written, flouri&s;h'd, and adorn'd with Golden Letters, we &s;aw five Unicorn's Horns, (as they <PB N="198" REF="104">call'd
'em,) three long and thick, two &s;mall and &s;lender, like tho&s;e we have el&s;ewhere &s;een (&s;aid to be &s;uch too.) Here are two &s;mall bra&s;en Images, &s;uppos'd to be Heathen Gods, and by them wor|&s;hipp'd.</P>
<P>On <HI>Sunday</HI> (in mo&s;t decent manner) we went to the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Church, which is a good old Piece of Building; the Chancel is let for a Joyners Shop, &s;o little do they value what was once con&s;ecrated (becau&s;e after the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> manner) to God; the Congregation was &s;mall, between one and two hundred, zealous Par&s;on and People, no <HI>Engli&s;h Liturgy</HI> read here, all <HI>Presbyteri|ans;</HI> we view'd the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ca|thedral Church, it was once &s;o, tho' not now;
'tis very capaci|ous, built Abby manner, and af|ter <PB N="199" REF="104">the old Fa&s;hion, half of it fell in &s;ome years &s;ince, is not repair'd, becau&s;e the People are poor; here is a very lofty old Steeple, which we a&s;cended, and whence we took a view of this good, great, old City, and of &s;everal Churches and old Buildings, for|merly Mona&s;teries and Nunne|ries. In the chief is <HI>Van Ghent</HI>'s Monument, not &s;o &s;plendid as el&s;ewhere; he was <HI>De Rutter</HI>'s Vice-Admiral, and &s;lain by the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in the Naval Engage|ment <HI>Anno</HI> 1672; he was of a noble Family of the Province of <HI>Guelderland</HI> (which is contigu|ous to this,) and Colonel of a Marine Regiment, train'd up to the Sea Service, and ready at all times for that, as al&s;o the Land Service, and in a &s;carcity of Sea-men, of great U&s;e to &s;up|ply <PB N="200" REF="105">that Defect, being Amphi|bious.</P>
<P>The Streets are broad and clean, and the <HI>Stadthou&s;e</HI> a &s;mall neat old Building, with a fair Piazza, or Market-Place. They take great Liberty here on <HI>Sun|days,</HI> playing at Tables, Dice, and other Games with <HI>Cowries</HI> (or Blackmoors Teeth, as the Chil|dren call 'em) at the Coffee-Hou&s;es and Taverns, and have Mu&s;ick in the Publick-Hou&s;es; the &s;ame is indeed practis'd at the <HI>Hague</HI> and <HI>Am&s;terdam;</HI> tho' in other Places they are a little more &s;trict, particularly in
<HI>Zea|land;</HI> but they live very loo&s;ly in the Provinces of
<HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>&V;trecht,</HI> buy and &s;ell frequent|ly on this Day, and e&s;pecially Provi&s;ions; which is the more rea&s;onable, becau&s;e of Travel|lers <PB N="201" REF="105">pa&s;&s;ing and re-pa&s;&s;ing, and they mu&s;t not &s;tarve on this, tho' the <HI>Lord's-Day.</HI></P>
<P>The next Day we hir'd a Wag|gon to carry us to
<HI>Soe&s;tdike,</HI> nine Miles from <HI>&V;trecht;</HI> 'tis oue of King
<HI>William</HI>'s Hunting-Hou&s;es, formerly much frequen|ted by him, there being abun|dance of Game about it, e&s;peci|ally Phea&s;ant and Partridge; it is a very pretty Box, and lately (that is &s;ome Years &s;ince) built, excellent Painting of Game, of all kinds, on the Walls and Cie|lings; the Lodgings are &s;mall, but neat; good Gardens, curi|ou&s;ly planted and made up; a Park of &s;ix <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Miles about, five hundred Head of Deer; a pretty Engine or Mill, about three hundred Yards from the Hou&s;e, which conveys Water <PB N="202" REF="106">through leaden Pipes under Ground to &s;erve all the Offices in the Hou&s;e; very fine Walks, and rows of Trees about it, which renders it indeed very plea&s;ant. Having &s;ufficiently diverted our &s;elves here with the Plea&s;ures &s;uitable to the Sea&s;on, we went back to <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> whence the next day we took a Boat with Sails and cro&s;t the Riyer <HI>Y</HI> to <HI>Buyck &s;loot,</HI> a village about a League off, and went thence by Water in another Boat drawn with a Hor&s;e, to <HI>Promerent,</HI> a &s;mall old City, two Leagues further, which has a Vote among&s;t the <HI>States,</HI> and is very rich in her Finances. Here we hir'd two Chai&s;es for two Days, and gave two Rix-dollers for each; we pa&s;t through the <HI>Beem&s;ter,</HI> Land &s;o call'd, which
<PB N="203" REF="106">the Sea formerly broke into, but was &s;oon mill'd out:
'Tis very fat Pa&s;ture, feeding yearly abun|dance of Cattel of &s;everal &s;orts, which are brought from <HI>Frie&s;|land, Norway, Denmark,</HI> and o|ther Places lean, and here fat|ten'd. Many Country Gentle|men have fine Country Hou&s;es, all round about, adorn'd with plea&s;ant rows of Trees, and beau|tified with Paintings. We din'd at <HI>Schermerhoorn</HI> (a &s;mall Vil|lage) on Fi&s;h, becau&s;e we could have nothing el&s;e, nor indeed can we in any of the &s;mall Towns through which we tra|vell'd; but this amends they make us, they are very new, be|cau&s;e always alive; nay, the common People (love their Bel|lies &s;o well) they'ell not buy any Fi&s;h if they but only langui&s;h, <PB N="204" REF="107">much le&s;s be dead: At this Place we had a mind to have a lit|tle Butter melted thick for Sawce, after the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> man|ner, which with much entreaty, and many good words, (the only way to work upon tho&s;e rough, clowni&s;h People) we were pro|mis'd, and in part had, for it was thick enough indeed, almo&s;t like ha&s;ty Pudding, for they had put abundance of Flower in, with|out which they can't (that is, they won't) melt but boil But|ter to Oil; they &s;ay, 'tis then be&s;t, being thinne&s;t, and goes farthe&s;t; they are, as I &s;aid be|fore, generally choice Cooks, but then 'tis only for their own Country Folks.</P>
<P>Five or &s;ix Miles from this Place lies <HI>ALKMAER,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Alkmaer.</NOTE> which is one of the neate&s;t, and plea|&s;ante&s;t, <PB N="205" REF="107">(tho') olde&s;t Cities in all the
<HI>Low-Countries,</HI> being built in the Year 1550; 'tis very clean, and hand&s;omly pav'd; we rid through part of it, without &s;top|ping longer than to take a Gla&s;s of old Hock, and away we went to <HI>Egmont</HI> a&s;ide
<HI>Hoef,</HI> three Miles off, a &s;weet little Village; there &s;tands an old ruin'd Ca&s;tle: Thence to <HI>Egmont</HI> by the Sea|&s;ide, about a Mile further, a &s;mall Village of Fi&s;hermen, who&s;e Wives and Children were ma|king Nets for their Husbands Service, who were then at the Salt Water getting Bread for them; &s;o nothing is idle here: Thence through another Village call'd by the &s;ame Name, a Mile di&s;tant, it lies along the Sand Downs; here's a pretty Church, two Steeples, and the Ruines of
<PB N="206" REF="108">an old Fort or Ca&s;tle; the Counts of <HI>Egmont</HI> (fam'd in Story) are Lords of the Lands and Reve|nues all round about; we diver|ted our &s;elves with driving to and fro, and viewing the main Sea, and then return'd, and &s;upp'd, and lay that Night at <HI>Alkmaer,</HI> and the next Day took an exact and particular view of this flouri&s;hing City. It was for|merly burnt and plunder'd by the <HI>Frie&s;landers,</HI> and
<HI>Guelder|landers,</HI> but &s;oon re built by the Inhabitants, and fortified after the manner of that Age, but better by <HI>William</HI> the Fir&s;t, Prince of Orange, who commanded &s;ome new and &s;trong Works to be added to it, which prov'd of manife&s;t Advantage to them in the Sige which the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> laid to it, <HI>Anno</HI> 1573, under the Duke
<PB N="207" REF="108"><HI>D'Alva,</HI> after he had taken <HI>Haer|lem,</HI> but they were forced to ri&s;e from before <HI>Alkmaer</HI> with Shame and Lo&s;s. It is the Capital Ci|ty of the North Parts of <HI>Hol|land,</HI> and &s;ends Deputies to the <HI>Hague,</HI> and has a Se&s;&s;ion in the Admiralty, and a Stock in the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company, and a great Manufactory in Linnen-Cloth; the Country round about is ve|ry Fruitful, and yields abundance of good Corn, Butter, and Chee&s;e; of which la&s;t they have here a very fine Market, and the greate&s;t variety of &s;orts we ever &s;aw, &s;ome made with Anni-Seeds, &s;ome of Commin-Seeds, other of Sheeps-Milk di&s;colour'd with green, all very indifferently ta|&s;ted; and (in our Opinion) the very be&s;t was far &s;hort of our Chedder, or <HI>Che&s;hire;</HI> we had al|&s;o
<PB N="208" REF="109">Parme&s;an-Chee&s;e about four|teen Pence
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Money <HI>per</HI> Pound, which indeed is firm and well ta&s;ted, but not &s;o mellow and delicious as ours, (at lea&s;t in our Thoughts, nor are we partial.)</P>
<P>We view'd their great Church, which is of curious Architecture, and one of the fine&s;t in the&s;e <HI>Provinces;</HI> 'tis neatly Wain&s;cot|ted, and well kept; has a very fine, large, well-painted Organ, which plaies every Day from ele|ven till twelve, and makes excel|lent Mu&s;ick. And we &s;aw their <HI>Stadthou&s;e,</HI> which is a neat old plain Building, and &s;tands in a fine, broad, cleanly, and well-pav'd Street. Their Fi&s;h-Market is well &s;tor'd with great plenty of Perch, Carp, Eeels, Popes, Bleaks very large, and Jacks, <PB N="209" REF="109">(but a few) all alive, and very cheap.</P>
<P>So having &s;een all that was Rare and Curious, we mounted, and return'd to <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> where we &s;pent two or three Days in fini&s;hing our Ob&s;ervations, and in buying &s;ome Toies, and fine Things (of which they have abundance) to pre&s;ent our Friends at our Return, we left this renown'd City, and pa&s;s'd through <HI>Haerlem</HI> and the <HI>Hague</HI> once more, and &s;o to <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> where we &s;taid two or three Days more; and thence went by Wa|ter to <HI>Dort,</HI> a beautiful, &s;trong and rich City in this Province, fam'd for the Synod held here about Religious Matters, <HI>Anno</HI> 1618. to determine the Contro|ver&s;ies between the

<HI>States</HI> of <HI>Holland;</HI> 'tis well built, and ve|ry neat; had once the &s;ole Right of Coinage, but now other Places in the&s;e Provinces have got the like Privilege; the Sea frequently breaks in upon it, but more formerly, and drown'd above ten thou&s;and Per&s;ons, and laid twelve Villages under Wa|ter, and once &s;eventy Villages and one hundred thou&s;and Peo|ple.</P>

<P>The Earls of <HI>Holland</HI> in anci|ent Times kept their Courts there; it was al&s;o formerly the Staple Town for Merchandi&s;es Exported, but has now only the Staple of Rheni&s;h Wines, with which they drive a great Trade, and brew abominably, mixing <HI>French</HI> White Wine, and other cheap, and ordinary, thin, lean, and hungry Wines with that noble Juice, that it has in a man|ner lo&s;t the very natural ta&s;te, and is indeed poor in&s;ipid &s;tuff; however, we met with good old Hock here, becau&s;e we were willing to pay the highe&s;t Price. Formerly the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> bought abundance of this &s;orry Wine, but they are grown wi&s;er, they now buy but little; the

<P>And here we embark'd for <HI>Zealand,</HI> being re&s;olv'd to make the Tour of that <HI>Province,</HI> more particularly for the &s;ake of tho&s;e two Renown'd Cities, <HI>Midle|burg</HI> and <HI>Flu&s;hing:</HI> But before we leave the <HI>Province</HI> of <HI>Holland</HI> (where we yet are) it will be fit to recollect &s;omething (and very material) which we omit|ted, and had like to have for|got. <PB N="213" REF="111">Before we left

<PB N="220" REF="115">their Words for the re&s;t; nor did we hear any Mu&s;ick there. This <HI>State</HI> makes an Advantage of the&s;e light Ladies, for each for her Admi&s;&s;ion mu&s;t pay three Pence; by laying out of which &s;he hopes to get more.</P>
<P>In Summer the principal Di|ver&s;ion here is, to keep (as &s;ome) or to hire (as mo&s;t do) a Chai&s;e, and take their Mi|&s;tre&s;&s;es (often) or Wives (&s;ome|times) abroad into the Coun|try, and give them the Air, and a hand&s;ome Treat, returning home for the mo&s;t part in the Evening. We have &s;een three or four&s;core of the&s;e Chai&s;es, or &s;mall Chariots abroad at one time, and together, tho' almo&s;t all of different Company.</P>
<PB N="221" REF="115">
<P>In Winter the Ladies or bet|ter &s;ort of Women are, when the Fro&s;t is hard, and the Streets &s;lippery with hardned Snow, (which is often) taken abroad by their Gallants (often) or Husbands, (&s;eldom except when fir&s;t married) in <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Sleads or Sledges, richly Guilt and Car|ved, cover'd with Embroidery of Gold, or Silver, or rich Silk, or Tape&s;try, drawn by a fine Hor&s;e, richly Harne&s;s'd, with which they are very &s;wiftly dri|ven from Street to Street, from one Burgal to another, for about two Hours, and then brought home; whence after a little Re&s;t, and a di&s;h of Tea, they are attended to the Play-Hou&s;e, and &s;o home, and to Tea (not cold) again, and then to Cards, <PB N="222" REF="116">which they u&s;e much, and hold long, both before and after Sup|per, which they rarely fail of loving their Bellies as well as any People in the World, tho' they would be thought to do the contrary.</P>
<P>The ordinary &s;ort of People divert them&s;elves but little in the Summer, except in Walking, (chiefly out of the City in <HI>Sun|day</HI>'s Afternoon,) and in Win|ter in Skating, which they do very much, and promi&s;cuou&s;ly, Boys and Girls, young Men and Maidens, and &s;ome few of the better Sort are &s;ometimes &s;een on the Ice at that Sport.</P>
<P>The Merchandi&s;e in this Ci|ty, even the heavie&s;t,
<HI>viz.</HI> huge Fats of Rheni&s;h Wine, is drawn on Sledges, very low, and con|&s;i&s;ting <PB N="223" REF="116">of two Pieces of Wood in length about ten ot twelve Feet, held together by two Pieces acro&s;s, and cover'd with Iron at top; and on this they lay the Goods, having no great hea|vy lumbring Carrs, like ours; the Brewers al&s;o carry their Drink abroad thus; all having a little Tub of Water upon the Sledge, which they often &s;pill on the Ground, to make it go the glibber: The Drivers of the&s;e, as al&s;o of their travelling Waggons, are (like our Car|men and Coach-men) often rude, and affront Folks; but then up|on Complaint to the Burgo-Ma&s;ters, they &s;hall be puni&s;h'd by Su&s;pen&s;ion, or otherwi&s;e, ve|ry &s;everely.</P>
<PB N="224" REF="117">
<P>They have no Coaches like our Hackneys, that ply in the Streets, but you may hire a Sledge, which is the Body of a Coach upon a Sledge without Wheels, and drawn by a Hor&s;e, the Coach is a hand&s;om one, and the Hor&s;e a good one, and the Fellow in very good Ha|bit; and thus the better Sort are carried to Church, and to the Play-Hou&s;e, and to Vi&s;its; the Price rea&s;onable: But then at the <HI>Hague, Am&s;terdam,</HI> and other Places, you may hire (as we did often) a hand&s;ome Coach on Wheels, and a Pair of good Hor&s;es, to carry you a|ny where out of Town.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> every where ob|&s;erve a great Decency in their Funerals, all the Men follow|ing <PB N="225" REF="117">the Corp&s;e (two by two, in hand&s;ome black Cloaks,) which are brought to the Church (up|on a forfeit of twenty-five <HI>Guil|ders</HI> the fir&s;t, and fifty the &s;e|cond half Hour, to be given to the Poor) at two, or thereabouts, the Doors being lock'd up at three. The dead Body mu&s;t lie three Days in open view, to &s;a|tisfie the Relations that it was a natural Death; and in &s;ome Places (in the&s;e <HI>Provinces</HI>) when any Body dies, there is a Tru&s;s, or Bundle of Straw laid at the Door, where it continues till the Day of the Burial, and is great or &s;mall according to the Age, and Sex, there being a very large Bundle for a Man, le&s;s for a Woman, and much le&s;s for a Child.</P>
<PB N="226" REF="118">
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> are the wor&s;t Nur&s;es in the World, they can't make a little good common Broth, Gruel, or Caudle, are hard|hearted too, and carele&s;s of the Sick; if you can recover by &s;trength of Nature, and a &s;mall help from your Doctor, &s;o; if not, you may die, they are very indifferent in the matter.</P>
<P>In the Publick Hou&s;es we pay for Pipes, Candles, and e|very thing; the Exci&s;e is very high, and heavy, &s;o that it can't be avoided; but then you are &s;erv'd with very fine Pipes (which you may break if you plea&s;e) and large, white, tall Candles, made of pure Tallow, but bad Wick, and &s;o don't burn extraordinarily.</P>
<PB N="227" REF="118">
<P><HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> is in no fear of Fo|reign or External Force, they can, when they plea&s;e, cut their Dykes, their Banks, and lay the Country under Water, and &s;o prevent the Enemies ap|proach.</P>
<P>And now for the Province of <HI>ZEALAD,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Zealand.</NOTE> to which we are under &s;ail, and very near; land|ing about eight in the Morn|ing at <HI>Middleburg,</HI> the Capital Town in the I&s;land of <HI>Walche|ren;</HI> it was formerly a very &s;orry Village, but now a noble, well-built, rich, and very &s;trong City; 'tis but twenty five Miles North-Ea&s;t of <HI>Bruges</HI> in <HI>Flan|ders;</HI> it has a very great Trade in Times of Peace, e&s;pecially with <HI>France</HI> for Wines, (chiefly White, of which here is the <PB N="228" REF="119">Staple) but now fits out almo&s;t a hundred Sail of Privaties, (by them call'd <HI>Capers</HI>) which extreamly annoy the <HI>French</HI> Coa&s;t-Trade, having done them more Harm than all their Ene|mies be&s;ides; they have &s;ome of forty and thirty Guns, which are &s;ent into the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and where they meet with rich Boo|ty, having abundance of <HI>French</HI> Ships (&s;ome of their Cargo's very valuable, e&s;pecially tho&s;e from <HI>Martinico</HI>) in their Har|bour, taken this War: While we were there, they brought in &s;everal good Prizes.</P>
<P>This Town has a good &s;hare in the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company's Stock, and have a Chamber here, and Sales of Goods that come from thence; the Merchants <PB N="229" REF="119">coming from other
<HI>Provinces</HI> to buy them. Here were former|ly &s;ome con&s;iderable
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants, but now none, there being but little Trade between them and us: There is an <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> Church, about an hundred Auditors, all <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> from
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Scotch</HI> Parents.</P>
<P>Here is an Exchange, and but an indifferent one, and thin of Merchants. The Churches here are large, and hand&s;omly built, the Hou&s;es al&s;o, but not &s;o new and modi&s;h as at <HI>Am&s;terdam;</HI> the Place is moderately populous, Markets well &s;tor'd with Fi&s;h, and Fle&s;h, both rea&s;onable: The People, both at Land and Sea, are not at all like the
<HI>Hollanders,</HI> who are fat, &s;winging, &s;wag|bellied
<PB N="230" REF="120">Fellows, but the&s;e &s;mall, neat, tight, &s;mart Lads, and the be&s;t Sea-men for Fighting and Privateering of all the <HI>Seven Pro|vinces;</HI> they are indeed true bred Sea-Rats; the <HI>Hollanders</HI> &s;ail more in the Merchant Ser|vice, the&s;e in the States, and in Capers.</P>
<P>Here is a good hand&s;ome <HI>Stadthou&s;e,</HI> an old Piece; the People here are more re&s;erv'd, or rather more melancholick than in other
<HI>Provinces;</HI> and the Magi&s;trates are very &s;evere in puni&s;hing lew'd Women, and Men, e&s;pecially the fir&s;t, which makes them very clo&s;e and pri|vate in their Amorous Affairs: They are more loo&s;e, and greater Libertines in the Places whence we came, and drink more to
<PB N="231" REF="120">exce&s;s, as well as dally with Wo|men.</P>
<P>We hir'd a Yacht and went on board &s;ome of their
<HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Ships, a League below the Town, where we were very ci|villy receiv'd and entertain'd, (tho' Strangers) for all the <HI>Dutch</HI> are not &s;uch very Boors as re|ported; but they are a &s;low, heavy People (in Under&s;tand|ing, but not in Indu&s;try) and mu&s;t not be hector'd and thun|der'd at, but mildly and gently handled; we won upon 'em wonderfully, giving them obli|ging Words, and u&s;ing civil Actions, we melted them into Complai&s;ance (which is not ve|ry natural to them) and by &s;ome happy and engaging Healths which we invented, and began, <PB N="232" REF="121">(<HI>viz.</HI> Pro&s;perity to the State, to the Province, to the Company Trading to <HI>India,</HI> Union to the Allies, Victory to the Confede|rates, Downfal of <HI>France,</HI> Con|tinuation of Friend&s;hip in our own Private Society, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) toge|ther with the Wine, (of which they were liberal, even to an exce&s;s) we were &s;oon all of a Piece, the be&s;t Friends in the World, nothing like us, happy mixture of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and
<HI>Dutch.</HI> We took leave in time, and had Light enough ju&s;t to ob&s;erve the <HI>Ramekins,</HI> &s;o fam'd in An|nals, and &s;o much and &s;o fre|quently talk'd of, being put into the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our Renown'd and Glorious Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> as a Mortgage for Money lent the
<HI>States, (when Poor and <PB N="233" REF="121">Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed:)</HI> 'Tis an old fa&s;hi|on'd Fort, and guards the Mouth or Entrance of the River which leads to <HI>Middleburgh,</HI> and is but a &s;orry feeble Thing.</P>
<P>But thence we went to <HI>FL&V;|SHING,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Flu&s;hing.</NOTE> where we lay all Night, and next Morning early walk'd round all their Fortifica|tions, which are modern, &s;trong, in good repair, and command the River, and a pretty way to Sea.</P>
<P>Here is a large old, and a ve|ry great new Dock to build in, and to lay up their bigge&s;t Ships of War, which this Province fur|ni&s;hes to their <HI>Quota;</HI> there were &s;everal new Frigats, and Ships of great Force on the Stocks, which will be ready early the next Spring: Here they build, <PB N="234" REF="122">and hence they &s;end out a great many Capers, that Plague the <HI>French,</HI> and return rich, (as they us'd to do from Us when in War with <HI>England,</HI>) they have al|ways forty or fifty abroad; they chiefly live by that Trade, and by re-taking their own Country|mens, and Allies Ships, having Salvage for the &s;ame, if within the Benefit of the Law Marine, or el&s;e all to them&s;elves.</P>
<P><HI>Flu&s;hing</HI> is a fine City and no|ble Port, one of the Cautionary Places deliver'd to the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> It &s;tands at the Mouth of the River <HI>Scheld,</HI> where is a very convenient Haven, but a League from <HI>Middleburg,</HI> which is big|ger than this, but not &s;o popu|lous: Here are a great many Fi&s;her-Boats and &s;mall Craft be|long
<PB N="235" REF="122">to both Places, but mo&s;t to this: Hence is the Pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Flanders,</HI> who&s;e Banks are in &s;ight, and
<HI>Bruges</HI> is but twenty-two Miles off.</P>
<P>This is the Key of the Sea of the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> and is a hand&s;ome, cleanly, well-built Place, but not very modern: It was (in vain) attempted by the Dukes of <HI>Alva</HI> and <HI>Palma,</HI> but now thought almo&s;t impregna|ble: This poor <HI>Province</HI> has been mightily expos'd to Inundati|ons, and been almo&s;t ruin'd by tho&s;e prodigious ones, <HI>An.</HI>
1304, and 1509.</P>
<P><HI>TERVEER</HI> is the next con|&s;iderable Town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Yerveer.</NOTE> to which we went, and where we made but a &s;hort &s;tay, it being far inferior <PB N="236" REF="123">to the t'other two, tho' this is the Third in the <HI>Province,</HI> the re&s;t being but incon&s;iderable, and rather Villages.</P>
<P>Here is a good <HI>Stadthou&s;e,</HI> and and a good Church or two; the Hou&s;es are older, and nothing near &s;o Magnificent as in the t'other two Towns; nor is their Commerce to be compar'd, tho' they have a Snack in the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company's Stock, and have &s;ome other &s;mall Trade, and &s;ome Fi&s;hermen.</P>
<P>King <HI>William,</HI> as Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es mo&s;t of the Lord|&s;hips and Baronies in this
<HI>Pro|vince,</HI> and my Lord <HI>Odyke</HI> &s;ome of the re&s;t, who keeps a kind of a Court, and makes &s;ome &s;mall Figure when at <HI>Middleburg;</HI> we vi&s;ited his Palace, which &s;tands <PB N="237" REF="123">plea&s;antly, but affords no extra|ordinary Remarks. The Wea|ther began to be cold, &s;ome Snow fell, and Ice was fear'd, which would have pent us in this famous I&s;land, (which has fifteen or &s;ixteen little ones with|in it) &s;o we re&s;olv'd to take our Leaves of it; and accordingly took Boat for <HI>Hevoet &s;luice,</HI> where we arriv'd in a lucky Minute, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Packet-Boat being within two Hours after to &s;ail, and had a very fair Gail pre|&s;ented; &s;o we went a&s;hoar, re|fre&s;h'd our &s;elves, bought Pro|vi&s;ions good &s;tore, (there being no Halfway-Hou&s;e at Sea,) and laid in &s;ome good old Hock and Brandy, and &s;o embark'd about nine that Morning, and next Morning early landed at <HI>Har|wich,</HI> <PB N="238" REF="124">(being glad we were once more got on <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ground, in our Opinion, the be&s;t in the World,) where we re&s;ted a few Hours, took Coach, and came to
<HI>Colche&s;ter,</HI> where we lay that Night, and furni&s;h'd our &s;elves with Eringo, or Sea Holy-Root canded, (and the be&s;t done in
<HI>England,</HI>) at four Shillings the Pound, and fill'd our Bellies with large, fat, white, firm Oy|&s;ters, and bought &s;ome to bring home; and next Day in the E|vening, being the <HI>19th</HI> of <HI>Novem|ber</HI> 1695, arriv'd &s;afe and &s;ound in <HI>London,</HI> whence we had been ab&s;ent three Months and five Days.</P>
