<HEAD>A IOVRNALL OF the Voyage of the young Prince <HI>Frede|ricke Henry,</HI> Prince of Bohemia, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_ON the 12. day of September <HI>Anno</HI> 1620. the Court remoued from <HI>Prague</HI> to <HI>Brandis</HI> or <HI>Prandis,</HI> (being three miles di&s;tant) on the riuer <HI>Elb,</HI> neere where the riuer <HI>Gitzera</HI> fals into the <HI>Elb:</HI> where the Prince the next day following, taking his leaue of the King and Queen his father and mother, and being royally attended, &s;et forwards towards <HI>Barlene,</HI> the chiefe re&s;idence of the Marque&s;&s;e Elector of <HI>Brandenburg</HI> his vncle. Although the pa&s;&s;ages were too full of &s;ouldiers for him to goe the neere&s;t way: for which cau&s;e, and for the better commodity of lodging, &s;haping his cour&s;e from <HI>Prage</HI> full North; on the thirteenth of September hee &s;et out from <HI>Brandis:</HI> which Towne being no great State, is in the &s;ame longi|tude and latitude with <HI>Prage,</HI> that is, 29. and 46. and &s;ome odde minutes, and vpon the great and faire riuer of <HI>Elbe</HI> or <HI>Albis,</HI> which the Bohemians call <HI>Labe;</HI> which we pa&s;&s;ing, came the &s;ame day to <HI>Wie&s;wa&s;&s;er,</HI> which &s;ignifies in Engli&s;h White wa|ter, the Bohemians call it <HI>Biela:</HI> an ancient City it is, and though it be &s;ituated in the Kingdome of
<PB N="2" REF="3"> <HI>Bohemia,</HI> yet is this with diuers others vnder a par|ticular gouernment of &s;ome of the ancient Nobili|ty of that Country: this City is fiue miles from <HI>Brandis,</HI> eight from <HI>Prage.</HI></P>
<P>Hereabouts are al&s;o (almo&s;t) continuall great waldts or woods, which marching from the banks almo&s;t of the riuer <HI>Elbe,</HI> Ea&s;t and We&s;t, tend euen to the borders of the vpper <HI>Lu&s;atia,</HI> which is one of the incorporated Prouinces belonging to the Kingdome of <HI>Bohemia:</HI> At this <HI>Wi&s;wa&s;&s;er</HI> the Prince was met by the Inhabitants, and brought into the Ca&s;tle, and there by the Burgraues appointment (him&s;elfe being through &s;ickne&s;&s;e vnable to come to waite vpon the Prince) hee was for that night entertained by the Citizens with very good ob|&s;eruance.</P>
<P>The next morning being the 14. of September, the Citizens brought him on his way with an able Conuoy of 150. hor&s;e and foot, till hee pa&s;t out of <HI>Bohemia</HI> into <HI>Leutznatz</HI> or <HI>Lu&s;atia;</HI> where at his fir&s;t entrance the town&s;men of <HI>Gabel</HI> met him, the chiefe of which company in the name of the town&s;|men made a complementall Oration, intimating their faithfull loues, and his mo&s;t hearty welcome vnto them. The Oration being ended, hee was conducted by them towards <HI>Gabel.</HI> Within halfe a miles riding he was met by a troope of hor&s;e, be|ing about 150. which were &s;ent from the Marque&s;&s;e of <HI>Iegeren&s;dorf.</HI> Here the Conuoy of <HI>Wi&s;wa&s;&s;er</HI> re|turned backe, and this troope brought him to the towne of <HI>Gabel,</HI> here the Prince dined. This <HI>Gabel</HI> is one of the fir&s;t good townes on the bor|ders
<PB N="3" REF="3"> of <HI>Lu&s;atia</HI> towards <HI>Bohemia;</HI> it &s;tands neere vnto the riuer of <HI>Nie&s;&s;e</HI> one of the chiefe Floods of <HI>Lu&s;atia,</HI> which ri&s;es not farre from hence.</P>
<P>From hence departing after dinner, about a mile off from the Towne, he was met by a &s;econd troupe of hor&s;e, &s;ent al&s;o from the &s;aid Marque&s;&s;e of <HI>Iegeren&s;dorf,</HI> by which troupes his Highne&s;&s;e was conuoyed to the City of <HI>Zittaw</HI> or <HI>Sittaw,</HI> &s;tanding vpon the riuer of <HI>Nie&s;&s;e.</HI> At the entrance whereof, he was receiued by two other troopes of hor&s;e, and three companies of foot, be&s;ides the Citizens them&s;elues &s;tanding all in their Armes on each &s;ide, with mu&s;icke of Trumpets on the Cathedrall Church, and Haultboyes on the tower of the Statehou&s;e, which &s;ounded vntill the Prince was entred into his lodging. Before which, by commandement of the towne, was placed a &s;trong Guard of both hor&s;e and foot, be&s;ides two compa|nies of foot placed within the gates in the Court, for defence of his per&s;on. And at each gate of the City for that night was &s;et an extraordinary &s;trong Court of Guard both of hor&s;e and foot, the times being then dangerous, becau&s;e the Duke of <HI>Saxo|ny</HI> was then in Armes, and held his Leaguer be|fore the City of <HI>Baultzen,</HI> within foure miles to the North-We&s;t of that place, vpon the riuer of <HI>Spre;</HI> and we were now vpon the borders of <HI>Mei&s;|&s;en,</HI> which is one of the Duke of <HI>Saxonies</HI> Coun|tries, and confines vpon <HI>Lu&s;atia,</HI> by a long tract of ground. And thus farre euen from <HI>Prage</HI> in <HI>Bo|hemia</HI> vnto <HI>Zittaw</HI> in <HI>Lu&s;atia,</HI> our Court was full North.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="4">
<P>But the next day being the 15. of September, departing from thence, we tooke vp vpon the right hand more towards the Ea&s;t, &s;etting forward to|wards <HI>Gorlitz,</HI> which al&s;o &s;tands vpon the riuer of <HI>Nie&s;&s;</HI> afore&s;aid, which riuer ri&s;ing in the Country of <HI>Mie&s;&s;en</HI> (I take it) ea&s;t-ward of <HI>Gabel,</HI> pa&s;&s;eth by <HI>Zittaw, Gorlitz,</HI> and &s;o north-ward through both the <HI>Lu&s;atiaes,</HI> till it fals into the <HI>Oder,</HI> which parts <HI>Lu&s;atia</HI> from <HI>Sile&s;ia.</HI> On the way towards this <HI>Gor|litz,</HI> (the Princes hor&s;es being almo&s;t wearied) he was met by certaine Coaches and diuers troopes of hor&s;e, &s;ent from the Marque&s;&s;e of <HI>Iegeren&s;dorf,</HI> who in that time of warre had his chiefe re&s;idence in that City. This guard tooke vp both &s;ides of the way for a mile and a halfe together: and within halfe a mile off the City, the Marque&s;&s;e him&s;elfe in per&s;on met the Prince, accompanied with 4000 hor&s;e and foote. And within a quarter of a mile off the City, he was receiued by the Citizens, ran|ging them&s;elues in armour on both &s;ides the way, their order extending euen to the very entrance of the Marque&s;&s;e his Palace. For the Princes better contentment, the &s;ouldiers were all commanded to march by in Battaglia and warlike order, with Drummes, Fifes, and En&s;ignes di&s;played. After all which the Prince was by the Marque&s;&s;e and all his Councell mo&s;t royally fea&s;ted. He was lodged in the Palace in a mo&s;t faire chamber, richly fur|ni&s;hed, and cut with antique works of great art and beauty. At this good entertainment we &s;tayed two nights and two dayes.</P>
<P>This <HI>Gorlitz</HI> is the chiefe towne of the vpper
<PB N="5" REF="4"> <HI>Lu&s;atia,</HI> and a fayre and a &s;trong one it is, as being naturally defended, partly by his mountainous &s;i|tuation, and by the nearne&s;&s;e of the Riuer of <HI>Nei&s;s,</HI> ouer which it hath a commodious &amp; well couered wooden Bridge. The Church of S. <HI>Peters</HI> is a very fayre peece, as is al&s;o the Tower of the State-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>On the third day after being the 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">. of <HI>Septem|ber,</HI> the Marque&s;&s;e with all his traine and troopes, brought his Highnes halfe a mile out of Towne, and there &s;olemnly taking his leaue, parted with him, commanding his Troopes to goe on with the Prince, and to convoy him to a gari&s;on-Town of his called <HI>Lauben,</HI> which is to the Ea&s;t-ward of <HI>Gorlitz,</HI> and &s;omething out of the way. At our ap|proach within two miles of the town, we might be|hold the Souldiers both Hor&s;e and Foot drawne forth in two diui&s;ions, the Hor&s;e in one, and the Foot in the other, and both ranged in battell-aray. The rea&s;on of this demeanour, was a iealou&s;ie of &s;ome treachery which they conceiued to be inten|ded again&s;t their Gari&s;on, for that the night before the Princes Quarter-ma&s;ter being &s;ent before, to giue them intelligence of his Highnes comming, they &s;uppo&s;ed him to haue bin a &s;py, and clapt him vp clo&s;e pri&s;oner, lading him with irons. The&s;e troops and companies of Gari&s;on Souldiers being afarre off di&s;couered, bred al&s;o the &s;ame iealou&s;ie of them in vs, as our approach did of vs in them, ei|ther part hauing a mi&s;pri&s;ion of the others inten|tions. Whereupon it was re&s;olued to &s;end a Trum|pet before, with certaine Gentlemen, to giue and
<PB N="6" REF="5"> take &s;atisfaction on eyther &s;ide. Whereupon they being better &s;atisfied, and all mi&s;tru&s;t being quite taken away, the chiefe Burgers of the Towne ad|uanced forwards, and comming to the Prince, they ki&s;t his Highnes hand: And after &s;ome &s;olemne Speech of entertainment, with their excu&s;e allea|ged, for their late behauiour, imputing the &s;ame to the danger of the time, and their vnexpected and &s;odaine notice of his arriuall, the Prince mounted on hor&s;e-backe, &amp; rode cleare through their troops towards the Towne: and hauing pa&s;t them, the hor&s;e and foot di&s;charged three vollies of &s;hot for his welcome: &amp; comming to the gates of the town he was receiued by a guard of towne-dwellers, and by them conueyed to his place of re&s;t, where for that day he dined, where al&s;o the Marque&s;&s;e of <HI>Ie|geren&s;dorfs</HI> Conuoy of hor&s;e left vs, and returned to <HI>Gorlitz.</HI></P>
<P>This towne of <HI>Lauben</HI> is &s;ituated vpon the banks of the Riuer <HI>Queis,</HI> which al&s;o runnes into the <HI>O|der,</HI> and is neare vnto the borders of <HI>Sile&s;ia,</HI> and vn|to a necke of land which thru&s;ts out from <HI>Bohemia</HI> al&s;o, which being very narrow at <HI>Gabel,</HI> we touch|ed vpon <HI>Mie&s;&s;en</HI> the Duke of <HI>Saxonies</HI> Country.</P>
<P>This <HI>Lauben</HI> is in the frontiers (as it were) both of <HI>Bohemia</HI> on the South-&s;ide, and <HI>Sile&s;ia</HI> on the Ea&s;t, it &s;elfe being the vtmo&s;t towne of the vpper <HI>Lu&s;atia,</HI> which makes the Gari&s;on to &s;tand more warily vpon their guard.</P>
<P>After dinner he was conducted out of the &s;ame Towne by a troope of hor&s;e of the towne gari&s;on, which waited vpon his Highnes, till hee came to
<PB N="7" REF="5"> the Citie of <HI>Limberge</HI> in <HI>Sile&s;ia,</HI> which town &s;tands vpon the Riuer of <HI>Bober,</HI> and not farre from the ri|uer <HI>Queis</HI> afore&s;aid. But before he came neare the Citie, the Prince was met by a troope of hor&s;e from thence, in the midde&s;t of whom he was con|ueiged to his lodging in the towne, which was one of the chiefe Burgers hou&s;es, where they placed a &s;trong guard at the doore, for the &s;afety of his per|&s;on. This was vpon a Saturday at night.</P>
<P>That day (his Highnes comming thither being knowne abroad in the country) all the young No|bility and Gentry thereabouts came in to &s;ee the Prince, and to wait vpon his Highnes at table at Supper-time, &s;o that all the Princes &s;eruants were for that time di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from their attendance vpon him.</P>
<P>The next day being Sunday, and <HI>Septemb.</HI> 19. the Prince mounted on hor&s;e-backe, the Nobilitie go|ing before him on foot, and their children on each &s;ide, with the troops of hor&s;e and Foot attending. In which &s;tately and &s;olemne manner his Highnes rode to Church, and heard a Sermon. Whence be|ing returned, he dined with the Nobility.</P>
<P>After dinner the &s;ame day, he was by them and their troops conducted to the Citie of <HI>Sompon&s;el,</HI> where he was mo&s;t nobly entertayned of the Ci|tizens. So &s;oon as the Prince was di&s;couered by the Watch vpon their Towers, they &s;ounded their Trumpets, and beat vp their great kettle-Drums, continuing &s;o vntill he came to the gates. Where as &s;oone as he was entred, the Town&s;-men making a guard of them&s;elues, gaue the Prince a lu&s;ty volley
<PB N="8" REF="6"> of &s;hot for his welcome. Then with the &s;ound of Corners and Haultboyes he was entertained to his lodging. At the entrance whereof the Town&s;-men gaue him another volley of &s;hot, and placing a &s;trong court of guard for that night before his lod|ging, departed.</P>
<P>The 20. of <HI>Sept.</HI> the Nobilitie tooke their leaue of the Prince, and the Town&s;-men waited vpon him with a conuoy to a place called <HI>Crozan,</HI> or <HI>Cro&s;&s;en,</HI> where his Highnes dined.</P>
<P>After dinner the &s;ame Conuoy brought him through till hee came to a citie called <HI>Frie&s;tadt,</HI> which is not farre from the borders of Poland, and lyes to the North the riuer <HI>Oder,</HI> running between this part of <HI>Sile&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Poland,</HI> through the Duchy of <HI>Cro&s;&s;en,</HI> which is finally parted from hence by a ledge of woody mountaines, tending north-we&s;t and by north by a long tract to the Ea&s;t-ward Here the troopes of <HI>Sompon&s;el</HI> left him, and returned homewards, the Souldiers both hor&s;e and foote of <HI>Frie&s;tadt</HI> receiuing him into their rankes in warlike order. All which by rea&s;on it was late and darke, was done by the Citizens by torch-light: by whom hee was gallantly conducted to his lodging, where he re&s;ted for that night.</P>
<P>This being the la&s;t towne we lay at in <HI>Sile&s;ia,</HI> the next day being the 21. of September, the Prince being conuoyed by &s;ome hor&s;e of the towne, wee entred into the <HI>Brandenburgher</HI> marck, that is, the marches or borders of the land of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> through which we pa&s;&s;ed on to the City of <HI>Franck|ford</HI> vpon <HI>Oder,</HI> &s;o called, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from
<PB N="9" REF="6"> the other <HI>Franckford</HI> which is neere to the Palati|nate, where the great Mart is twice a yeare kept; which is al&s;o called <HI>Franckford</HI> vpon <HI>Maine,</HI> be|cau&s;e that that &s;tands vpon the riuer of <HI>Maine,</HI> as this doth vpon the riuer of <HI>Oder.</HI> This la&s;t towne being vnder the gouernment of the Marque&s;&s;e E|lector of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> the chiefe Citizens at the Princes arriuall (according to their wonted man|ner to noble &s;trangers) pre&s;ented their loues in huge flaggons of wine (which growes here) and banquetting &s;tuffe, to the Prince; their flaggons being &s;o much the greater, in regard of their loues to the Duche&s;&s;e of <HI>Brandenburg</HI> their Prince&s;&s;e, who is Aunt to the Prince. This being moreouer the generall courte&s;ie of the great Cities of <HI>Ger|many,</HI> to pre&s;ent their loues to all Princes their friends, and Amba&s;&s;adors of Princes, with an Ora|tion, the Burgers bring each of them a great bottle of wine, which hangs by a ringle vpon his arme; and if hee hath any bu&s;ine&s;&s;e or Emba&s;&s;ie to their State, they &s;end him al&s;o Oates and Fi&s;h.</P>
<P>This <HI>Franckford</HI> is e&s;teemed the third towne of worth in the Country, and being vpon the very North we&s;t angle of <HI>Sile&s;ia,</HI> and about &s;ome 14. yeares before our being there (viz. <HI>Anno</HI> 1606.) was made an Vniuer&s;ity by <HI>Ioachim</HI> Marque&s;&s;e of <HI>Brandenburg:</HI> the <HI>Oder</HI> runnes vpon the Ea&s;t &s;ide, the other parts are fenced in by the mountaines.</P>
<P>From hence vpon the 22 of September wee &s;et forwards towards <HI>Rutter&s;dorp,</HI> but the way being wa&s;te ground, and without habitation, wee were faine to haue our proui&s;ion carried along with vs,
<PB N="10" REF="7"> and dined that day at a Boers hou&s;e. The &s;ame night his Highne&s;&s;e came to the village of <HI>Rutter&s;|dorp,</HI> where he lodged in the Ca&s;tle, both which belong vnto the Marque&s;&s;e of <HI>Brandenburg.</HI></P>
<P>At this place (the Marque&s;&s;e him&s;elfe being then in <HI>Pru&s;sia</HI> or <HI>Pruce</HI> land) the Prince was faine for that night to content him&s;elfe with &s;uch enter|tainment as the place could afford. But the Mar|chione&s;&s;e being certified of the Prince her Ne|phewes being there, &s;ent po&s;t all night, with plate and other proui&s;ion; which made &s;o good &s;peed, that by the morning there was &s;tore of furniture, and by break-fa&s;t time very good variety of proui|&s;ion of all &s;orts; which was a &s;trange change, and a &s;udden alteration, ouer night to be &s;erued in ve&s;|&s;els of Tin, and in the morning to haue a Cupbord of Plate. And thus by the Duche&s;&s;e noble care, the Princes &s;upper was well mended, by a full and &s;ufficient break-fa&s;t.</P>
<P>This Marchione&s;&s;e of <HI>Brandenburg</HI> is named <HI>Elizabetha Charlotta,</HI> daughter to <HI>Fredericke</HI> the fourth Prince Elector Palatine; and &s;i&s;ter to the pre|lent King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> the Princes father.</P>
<P>After which the 23: of September hee &s;et on towards <HI>Berlin,</HI> the Court of the Marque&s;&s;e, and ordinary place of his re&s;idence. The Duche&s;&s;e hearing of his aproach, by a Po&s;t which the Prince di&s;patcht to her aforehand, to giue her Highne&s;&s;e notice of his being &s;o nigh; the Duche&s;&s;e &s;ent forth her brother Prince <HI>Lodowicke,</HI> Duke of <HI>Simmern,</HI> and vncle to the Prince, together with a young Poli&s;h Duke (who&s;e father had beene bani&s;hed
<PB N="11" REF="7"> out of <HI>Poland</HI>) and Count <HI>Philip van Solmes,</HI> who all with a faire traine came to meet the Prince, of whom, after mo&s;t ioyfull and mutuall &s;alutations, he was brought into the Palace, where his High|ne&s;&s;e with the re&s;t of his followers were mo&s;t nobly welcomed, and royally fea&s;ted.</P>
<P>This gallant young Prince, vncle to our Prince <HI>Fredericke,</HI> is &s;tiled <HI>Lodowicke Philip,</HI> Count Pala|tine, &amp;c. was borne Nouem. 22. 1602. had the two Dukedomes of <HI>Simmern, Lautern,</HI> with the Coun|try of <HI>Sponheim</HI> a&s;&s;igned him for his portion, by his fathers Te&s;tament; which was confirmed vnto him by the Emperour <HI>Rodulphus</HI> the &s;econd: he going vp with his brother into <HI>Bohemia,</HI> had all his coun|try &amp; goods taken from him by <HI>Spinola</HI> in the Pala|tinate: hee went from <HI>Prage</HI> to <HI>Berlin</HI> before Prince <HI>Fredericke,</HI> where they now meeting, went into the <HI>Low-Countries</HI> together.</P>
<P>Here we abode ten dayes, hauing as great va|riety of entertainment, as that time of mourning would permit. For the old Marque&s;&s;e Elector be|ing lately decea&s;ed, and the hou&s;hold and whole Court all in mourning, and the day of the Funerall drawing neere, was not a time of mirth or mask|ing. In our &s;tay here, this one thing was excee|ding well worth the &s;eeing and remembring, which was this; The time of the Funerall growing, the vault in the great Church was opened, where Marque&s;&s;es Electors of <HI>Brandenburg</HI> &s;till v&s;e to be enterred. The Prince and all we of his traine were brought in to &s;ee the place; going downe into which, there was an obiect of State Antiquity and
<PB N="12" REF="8"> much reuerence, namely, the bodies of 16 Princes embaulmed in Coffins of Tin, and laid by three and three on the top of each other, with their &s;words and &s;purs hanging by them: which al&s;o be|&s;ides the worth of the pre&s;ent &s;ight, &s;howes al&s;o the antiquity of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion &s;ince the choice of that place of buriall. The Funerall was appointed to be fiue dayes after the Princes departure, which was now at hand.</P>
<P>After ten dayes &s;tay therefore, on the 3. of Octo|ber the Prince tooke his leaue of the Marchione&s;&s;e Electore&s;&s;e his Aunt, and of the re&s;t of the Court, and departed out of <HI>Berlin;</HI> and being accompa|nied with Prince <HI>Lodowick</HI> his Vncle, and Count <HI>Philip van Solmes,</HI> who from hence iournied with him all the way, and neuer left him till he came into <HI>Holland;</HI> they arriued the fir&s;t night at an old City and a &s;trong Ca&s;tle called <HI>Spandaw,</HI> for now from <HI>Berlin</HI> we turned about again on the left hand and full We&s;t: the riuer of <HI>Spre</HI> vpon which <HI>Berlin</HI> is &s;ituated, being betwixt that City and this <HI>Spandaw.</HI> Here the Prince lodged all night, his proui&s;ions and entertainments being all made at the charges of the Marchione&s;&s;e Electore&s;&s;e. This <HI>Spandaw</HI> &s;tands neere the con&s;cience of the two riuers <HI>Ha|vel</HI> and <HI>Spre.</HI></P>
<P>The next day being the 4. of October, the Prin|ces dined at a place called <HI>Sando,</HI> and the &s;ame night they lodged at a Dorpe called <HI>Berne&s;e;</HI> which becau&s;e they be places of no great account, I there|fore pa&s;&s;e them ouer without any more de&s;cripti|on of them.</P>

<P>The 5. of October the Princes dyned at the Citty of <HI>Ratenaw,</HI> which &s;tands by the Riuer of <HI>Hauell,</HI> be|yond this Citty, and to the North or Northwe&s;t lo&s;es him&s;elfe and his name in the greater <HI>Elue</HI> or <HI>Albis.</HI> Af|ter dinner they &s;et forwards againe, and came that night to the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Tungermund</HI> on the Riuer <HI>Elue.</HI> The place is &s;omething old, but what it is, is in the Marque&s;&s;e of <HI>Brandenburgs</HI> Dominions.</P>
<P>The next day being the 6. of October, the Princes pa&s;&s;ed through the Fore&s;t of <HI>Ne&s;lingham,</HI> where they al&s;o hunted; and that night they lay at the Marque&s;&s;es Lodge in the Forre&s;t: and thus farre the Marchione&s;&s;e &s;ent her plate, furniture, and &s;eruants to attend the Princes, and fea&s;ted them hitherto at her own charges. Which from hence being the boundary of the Marqui&s;ate on that &s;ide, returned home againe towards <HI>Berline.</HI> And all this while we held our cour&s;e full We&s;t from <HI>Berline.</HI> By the We&s;t|&s;ide of this Fore&s;t runs the Riuer <HI>Ohre,</HI> which we pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The next day being the 7. of October, they entred in|to <HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> Land, and dyning at a Towne called <HI>Caluer,</HI> they came the &s;ame night to a Colledge of Lutherans cal|led <HI>Miriando:</HI> where the Rector would not open his gates to receiue the Princes, vntil he heard his Princes the Duke of <HI>Brun&s;wicks</HI> plea&s;ure, who was at the &s;ame time 7. miles off from that place. Here we &s;tayed 2. houres and aboue, in a terrible &s;torme of rayne and winde, vntill a Po&s;t which the Prince&s;&s;e had di&s;patched the night before vnto the Duke, was returned. Vpon who&s;e arryuall with Let|ters from the Duke, the Prince&s;&s;e were receiued with all fitting re&s;pects, and the be&s;t entertainement that the place could afford. The Rector and the Society excu&s;ed them|&s;elues
<PB N="14" REF="9"> by rea&s;on of the times, which were dangerous, and full of &s;u&s;pition, and the per&s;ons of the Princes vnknown to any of them, and the Colledge it &s;elfe being a place of importance. A tedious night this was and a could, and &s;ome were wet with the rayne, and other&s;ome &s;capt bet|ter. But that which gaue vs &s;ome comfort, was; that a|bout midnight there came another Po&s;t from the Duke, who reque&s;ted the Princes to &s;tay there all the next day al&s;o, for that the Duke had not made his proui&s;ion for their entertainement at his Court in &s;uch a &s;hort warning. And in the meane his Highnes &s;ent in his own furniture for the Princes table, and commanded &s;uch proui&s;ion to be brought in, as the Country there abouts could afford, &s;o that we had there the next day by dinner time, all things fitting for entertainement.</P>
<P>The next day being the 9. of October, the Princes left the Colledge, and &s;et on towards <HI>Wolfenbuttell,</HI> the chiefe place of re&s;idence of the Duke of <HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> &amp; where the Court then was. But a little before we came to the Citty, the Duke of <HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> him&s;elfe, with the L. Chancellor of the Duchy, diuers of the priuy Councell, with many Nobles and Gentlemen, came forth of the Towne, with many faire Companies of hor&s;e, to entertain the 2. Prin|ces, &amp; &s;o went along together with them into the Town. Within which were diuers Companies of Souldiers with full Armies vnder their &s;euerall En&s;ignes with Colours flying, with Trumpets &s;ounding, Fifes playing, &amp; Drums beating in warlike manner, very gallant to behold, which &s;tood along vntill wee came to the Ca&s;tle. The Hault|boyes and Cornets playing in the meane time from of the top of a Tower, and a peale of Ordinance being &s;hot
<PB N="15" REF="9"> off at their entrance into the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>The Princes were led into very &s;tately, rich, and fayer Roomes in the Ca&s;tle, and euery where in the hou&s;e there Princely plenty and variety of all things nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The Princes hauing repo&s;ed them&s;elues a while, were by the Duke brought into the Dutche&s;&s;e Chamber, who being allied to them both, receiued them with all Ioy and contentment.</P>
<P>Supper time being come, the Princes were againe brought into a wondrous faier roome, where the Tables were couered and great &s;tate v&s;ed according to the Ger|man fa&s;hion of entertainement, which is full and &s;ump|tuous. In this &s;upping place, there was a roome wherein there was a very large and rich Cupboard of plate; at one end of which &s;tood the mu&s;ick of In&s;truments and voices, and at the other end &s;tood the Officers of the Cel|ler and Buttery, to fill wine and beer to the table. For here is beere in this Country which is rare in other places of <HI>Germany,</HI> though &s;carce good any where. Yet here at this <HI>Wolfenbuttell,</HI> is a huge va&s;t Tunne, larger then that of <HI>Hei|dleberg,</HI> but this is filled with <HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> beer, as that other with Rheni&s;h wine. There were al&s;o 6. other tables, where the 2. Princes &s;eruants did eate, the Dukes own Gentle|men bearing them company, which time and the whole three daies that we &s;taied here at this Royal entertainment was &s;pent with great mirth, iollity and extraordinary &s;how of magnificence, bounty, and courte&s;ie; al which ex|cellent well became a kin&s;man and a Prince.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Duke of <HI>Brun&s;wicks</HI> name is, <HI>Fredericus Vl|ricus,</HI> he was born the 5. of <HI>April</HI> 1591. he married <HI>Anna So|phia</HI> daughter of <HI>Iohn Sigi&s;mund, Marque&s;&s;e Elector of Bran|denburg</HI> then lately dead in <HI>Noue~ber</HI> 1619, &amp; &s;i&s;ter to <HI>Geor|gius
<PB N="16" REF="10"> Wilhelmus</HI> the pre&s;ent Prince: &s;he was borne March 17. 1598. the Dukes alliance with the Prince comes in by the mothers &s;ide: for <HI>Anne Queen of England</HI> was daughter to <HI>Frederick</HI> the 2. King of <HI>Denmark;</HI> as was al&s;o <HI>Eliza|beth</HI> her elder &s;i&s;ter, the mother of this pre&s;ent Duke. The Dutche&s;&s;es alliance with the Prince comes in by the hou&s;e of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> of which &s;he is de&s;cended. The Duke of <HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> hath as yet no children; his onely bro|ther and heire apparent is our valorous noble Champion <HI>Chri&s;tian D. of Brun&s;wick,</HI> and Bi&s;hop of <HI>Halber&s;tadt:</HI> he hath or had al&s;o 5. &s;i&s;ters.</P>
<P>Leauing therefore this Citty the 14. of October in the morning, the &s;ame day they came to a place called <HI>Stanberge,</HI> where the Princes dyned at the Dukes char|ges. The &s;ame night they lodged at a place called <HI>Collen|berge,</HI> which &s;tands vpon the We&s;t &s;ide of the Riuer of <HI>Glein.</HI></P>
<P>The 15. day the 2. Princes dyned at <HI>Hamelen</HI> which is by the <HI>Riuer</HI> of <HI>We&s;ter,</HI> and on the Ea&s;t &s;ide. After dinner they went to <HI>Dalmel,</HI> where they lodged. And thus farre the Princes was fea&s;ted and furni&s;hed whith Plate and other proui&s;ion Royall, at the &s;ole co&s;t and charges of his Highne&s;&s;e the Duke of <HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> who is elder brother to Duke <HI>Chri&s;tian of Brun&s;wick,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Halber&s;tadt</HI> the fa|mous young Warriour; and this Town is vpon the Con|fines of the Duchy of <HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> which is bounded on the We&s;t by the Country of <HI>We&s;tphalia,</HI> from which the <HI>We&s;er</HI> parts it. Here the Dukes Seruants and Officers re|turned from the Princes backe againe to <HI>Wolfenbuttell.</HI></P>
<P>This Duchy of <HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> was &s;ometimes accounted to <HI>Saxony,</HI> and got a particular and di&s;tinct name from <HI>Bru|no,</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="10"> who being &s;on to <HI>Ludolphus</HI> Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> laid the foundations of Citty in this Duchy, which of him is cal|led <HI>Brun&s;wick;</HI> the Dutchy of <HI>Luneburg</HI> hath al&s;o been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Dukes of <HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> continuing &s;o vntill the yeere of Chri&s;t 1430. in which the Country was di|uided between <HI>William the victorious,</HI> who had the title of <HI>Brun&s;wicke,</HI> and his vncle <HI>Bernard,</HI> who had the title of <HI>Luneburg:</HI> in who&s;e po&s;terity both the&s;e Dukedomes &s;till remaine, the Dukes of both being both of one family, <HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> being of the direct line, the elder hou&s;e, and the greater Dukedome. The chiefe City both of <HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> and of all <HI>Saxony,</HI> is the Towne of <HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> which giues name to the whole Duchy, although the Court be mo&s;t commonly kept at <HI>Wolfenbuttell,</HI> which with the whole Duchy we hauing left behind vs, entred next into <HI>Cleueland.</HI></P>
<P>The 16. of October &s;etting out &s;omewhat late, we ar|ryued the &s;ame night at a Citty called <HI>Belfield,</HI> where within a mile of the Towne, they were receiued by cer|taine troopes of hor&s;e, and &s;o conueyed to the Citty. En|tring the Gates, they were welcomed with a peale of Or|dinance; and &s;o by the Towne&s;men in Armour, they were brought into the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Spanberg,</HI> where the Gouer|nour and Captaine entertained them with their forces mar&s;halled in warlike order. Here the Princes were fea|&s;ted 4. dayes.</P>
<P>In the meane &s;pace it was con&s;ulted vpon for the Prin|ces &s;afety; that &s;eeing they were now to pa&s;&s;e by diuers Garri&s;ons of the Enemies: that it were be&s;t to di&s;patch a Po&s;t before hand to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> to certify his Excellency of the Prince&s;&s;es neerenes, which was al&s;o
<PB N="18" REF="11"> done. Both the Armies of the States and the Spaniards being then about <HI>We&s;el.</HI> Here it was al&s;o agreed vpon to &s;end Prince <HI>Lodowick</HI> with &s;ome others another way into <HI>Holland;</HI> that &s;o the Country-people might be &s;atisfied with his pre&s;ence in &s;tead of the Princes; which tooke effect accordingly; and did not onely giue the peo|ple good content through whom he pa&s;&s;ed, who came flocking into the high waies to &s;ee him; but al&s;o diuerted their expectations, from any thought of his pa&s;&s;age any other way: by meanes whereof, his Highnes the Prince of <HI>Bohemia</HI> pa&s;&s;ed in his way with the more &s;afety and &s;ecrecy.</P>
<P>From <HI>Spanburg</HI> Ca&s;tle we came next to the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Arden,</HI> which is vnder the Graue of <HI>Benthem;</HI> and &s;o by <HI>Glandorpe</HI> to <HI>Mareling,</HI> where we lodged all night. From whence forward the Towns being neer &amp; &s;o well known, I forbeare to make any further de&s;cription of them, but onely name them as we pa&s;&s;e through them.</P>
<P>From thence we went to <HI>Ru&s;&s;enbeck;</HI> from thence to <HI>Embsbourne;</HI> from thence to <HI>North-horne;</HI> from thence to <HI>Hardenberg,</HI> where we lodged. From thence we went to <HI>Realte;</HI> from thence to <HI>Deuenter</HI> in <HI>Holland,</HI> where we met with the Princes againe.</P>
<P>The next day we &s;et forwards towards <HI>Swoll,</HI> which is a &s;trong Town of Garri&s;on; where we &s;taied two nights and one day. And here the Count <HI>Erne&s;t</HI> van <HI>Ca&s;simere</HI> (who comming in Po&s;t from the Prince of <HI>Oranges</HI> Leaguer at <HI>We&s;el,</HI> had before met with the Princes) receiued the Prince into his charge, and &s;afe protection. And here Prince <HI>Lodo|wick</HI> departed from his Highnes, &amp; went directly towards the <HI>Hage:</HI> And Prince <HI>Frederick</HI> kept on towards <HI>Freez|land.</HI></P>
<PB N="19" REF="11">
<P>The next day at dinner being the 25. of October, wee came to a Citty of Garri&s;on called <HI>Steenwick,</HI> where his Highne&s;&s;e was met by the Burgers in Armes, &amp; receiued into the Town with a volley of &s;hot, and comming to the Ca&s;tle they di&s;charged a peale of Ordinance for his welcome: and all marched by in warlike manner in the Princes view.</P>
<P>From thence after dinner they came to <HI>Wolfingow,</HI> where they re&s;ted all that night.</P>
<P>The next day, they dined at <HI>Hernenfen,</HI> and came the &s;ame night to <HI>Luerden</HI> in <HI>Freezland,</HI> the place whether at his fir&s;t &s;etting out of <HI>Prage,</HI> it was his intention to goe. Here the chiefe&s;t of the Town met the Prince on Hor&s;e|back. At the entrance thereof, the Ordinance of the Cit|ty were di&s;charged to welcome him: and the Burgers within the Town in Armes, ranking them&s;elues on each &s;ide; conueied his Highnes to the Ca&s;tle being the Court of <HI>Count Erne&s;tus van Ca&s;simerus;</HI> at that in&s;tant time, be|ing receiued in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of <HI>Count William of Na&s;&s;aw</HI> his brother lately decea&s;ed, for Gouernour of <HI>Friezland.</HI></P>
<P>The Prince being come to the Court, and brought to an exceeding faire Chamber, beheld all the Town&s;men marching by in their Armes: &amp; then being brought to the Chamber of the Counte&s;&s;e, he was there mo&s;t Nobly en|tertained by them both, with all ioy and &s;olemnity.</P>
<P>And thus it plea&s;ed the Almighty God to leade this &s;weet young Princes fir&s;t one way, and then againe another way, now through friends Countries, and now through foes, as from <HI>Heidleberg</HI> in the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> to <HI>Prage</HI> in <HI>Bohemia</HI> at fir&s;t; &s;o now againe from <HI>Prage</HI> to <HI>Luerden:</HI> which is almo&s;t round about the middle part
