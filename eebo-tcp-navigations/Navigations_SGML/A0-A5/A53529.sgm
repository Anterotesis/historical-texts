<HEAD>PROLOGUE To a New PLAY, called Venice Pre&s;erv'd; OR <HI>THE PLOT DISCOVERED. At the Duke's Theatre, Spoken by Mr.</HI> SMITH.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>IN the&s;e un&s;ettl'd Times, when each man dreads</L>
<L>The Bloody Stratagems of bui&s;y Heads,</L>
<L>When we have fear'd three years I know not what,</L>
<L>Till Witne&s;&s;es begin to die oth' Root,</L>
<L>What made our Poet meddle with a <HI>Plot?</HI></L>
<L>Was't that he fanci'd, for the very &s;ake</L>
<L>And name of Plot, his trifling Play might take?</L>
<L>For there's not in't one Inch-board-evidence;</L>
<L>But is to each man's rea&s;on plain and &s;en&s;e:</L>
<L>And that he thinks a plau&s;ible defence.</L>
<L>Were Truth by Sen&s;e and Rea&s;on to be try'd;</L>
<L>Sure all our Swearers might be laid a&s;ide.</L>
<L>No, of &s;uch Tools our Author has no need,</L>
<L>To make his Plot, or make his Play &s;ucceed.</L>
<L>He of Black-Bills has no prodigious Tales,</L>
<L>Of <HI>Spani&s;h-pilgrims</HI> thrown a&s;hoar in <HI>Wales.</HI></L>
<L>Here's not one murdr'd Magi&s;trate, at lea&s;t</L>
<L>Kept rank, like Ven'&s;on, for a City-fea&s;t:</L>
<L>Grown four dayes &s;tiff, the better to prepare</L>
<L>And fit his plyant Limbs to ride in Chair,</L>
<L>Here are no Truths of &s;uch a Mon&s;trous &s;tature,</L>
<L>And &s;ome believe there are none &s;uch in Nature.</L>
<L>But here's an Army rais'd, though under ground,</L>
<L>Yet no Men &s;een, nor one Commi&s;&s;ion found.</L>
<L>Here is a Traitor too, that's very old,</L>
<L>Turbulent, &s;ubtile, mi&s;cheivous and bold,</L>
<L>Bloody, Revengeful; and to Crown his Part,</L>
<L>Loves fumbling with a Wench with all his heart,</L>
<L>And after having many Changes pa&s;t,</L>
<L>In &s;pight of Age, thanks Heav'n he's Hang'd at la&s;t.</L>
<L>Next, here's a Senator that keeps a Whore:</L>
<L>In <HI>Venice</HI> none a higher Office bore:</L>
<L>To Lewdne&s;s every night the Leacher ran:</L>
<L>Shew me in <HI>London</HI> &s;uch another man:</L>
<L>Match him at Mother <HI>Cre&s;wels</HI> if you can:</L>
<L>Ah <HI>Poland, Poland,</HI> had it been thy Lot</L>
<L>T' have heard in time of this <HI>Venetian-Plot,</HI></L>
<L>Thou &s;urely cho&s;en had&s;t one Plot from thence,</L>
<L>And honour'd Them, as thou ha&s;t <HI>England</HI> &s;ince.</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE <HI>to the &s;ame.</HI> Spoken by Mr. <HI>BETTERTON.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THe Text is done, and now for Application:</L>
<L>And when that's ended, give your Approbation.</L>
<L>Tho' the Con&s;piracy's prevented Here,</L>
<L>Methinks I &s;ee another Hatching There.</L>
<L>And there's a certain Faction fain would &s;way,</L>
<L>If they had &s;trength enough, and damn this Play;</L>
<L>But this the Author boldly bad me &s;ay.</L>
<L>If any take his plainne&s;s in ill part,</L>
<L>He's glad on't from the bottom of his Heart.</L>
<L>Poets in honour of the Truth &s;hould Write,</L>
<L>With the &s;ame Courage Brave Men for it Fight.</L>
<L>And tho' again&s;t him cau&s;ele&s;s hatred ri&s;e,</L>
<L>And dayly where he goes of late he &s;pies</L>
<L>The Frowns of &s;ullen and revengeful Eyes.</L>
<L>'Tis what he knows, with much contempt, to bear,</L>
<L>And &s;erves a Cau&s;e to good to let him fear.</L>
<L>He fears no Poy&s;on from an incens'd Drab,</L>
<L>No Ruffians five foot Sword, nor Ra&s;cals Stab:</L>
<L>Nor any other Snares of Mi&s;chief, laid,</L>
<L>Not a <HI>Ro&s;e-Ally,</HI> Cudgel, Ambu&s;cade.</L>
<L>From any privat Cau&s;e where Malice Reigns,</L>
<L>Or general Pique, that Blockheads have to Brains.</L>
<L>Nothing &s;hall daunt his Pen when Truth doth call,</L>
<L>No, not the Picture-Mangler at <HI>Guild-hall.</HI></L>
<L>The Rebel Tribe (of which that Vermin's one)</L>
<L>Have now &s;et forward, and the Cour&s;e begun.</L>
<L>And while that Prince's Figure they deface,</L>
<L>Dur&s;t their ba&s;e Fears but look him in the Face,</L>
<L>As they before had Ma&s;&s;acred His Name,</L>
<L>They'd u&s;e His Per&s;on as they've us'd his Fame.</L>
<L>A Face, in which &s;uch Lineaments they Read,</L>
<L>Of that Great Martyr, who&s;e Rich Blood they Shed,</L>
<L>That their Rebellious Hate they &s;till maintain,</L>
<L>And, in his Son, would Murder Him again.</L>
<L>With Indignation then let each brave Heart,</L>
<L>Rowze and Unite to take His Injur'd Part,</L>
<L>Till Royal Love and Goodne&s;s call Him Home,</L>
<L>And Songs of Triumph meet Him as He come.</L>
<L>Till Heaven His Honour and His Peace Re&s;tore,</L>
<L>And Villains never wrong His Vertue more.</L>
