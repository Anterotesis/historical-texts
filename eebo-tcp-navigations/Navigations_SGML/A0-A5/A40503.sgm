<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS I have always had a pa&s;&s;ionate
De&s;ire to &s;ee Foreign Countries, I
was no &s;ooner Ma&s;ter of my own Inclina|tions,
but I made it my Bu&s;ine&s;s, in the
pro&s;ecution of my De&s;ign, to attain to what|ever
might contribute to the Imploy|ment
of an hone&s;t Man, and to di&s;tingui&s;h
my &s;elf from tho&s;e Travellers, who run
over the World for the &s;ole delight they
have of &s;eeing different Objects, without
ever putting them&s;elves in a Condition
to be u&s;eful to their Country: Wherefore
being thus inclin'd, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the
Advice of my Friends, I took to the
Study of the <HI>Mathematicks,</HI> and at
length, by reading the Relations of others,
made my &s;elf familiarly acquainted with
the Hi&s;tory of the different Nations of
the World.</P>
<P><PB REF="6">
The Noi&s;e which Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Gennes</HI>
his Expedition made in 1695, deter|min'd
my Re&s;olutions of taking that Op|portunity
to go abroad, as believing I
could not do better than to lay hold of
the Conveniency of &s;o brave a Voyage;
and therefore without any more ado, I
abandon'd the little Experience that an
Age of Nineteen Years cou'd &s;upply me
with, to the Cour&s;e of my Fortune, came
quickly to make u&s;e of the Le&s;&s;ons I had
learnt (as well as the chief Officers of
the Mariners) under one of the great|e&s;t
Ma&s;ters of the Age; and began now
to come to the practick Part of what I
knew before but in the Theory. The ge|neral
Idea I had formed with my &s;elf
of the Voyage, and the frequent Con|ver&s;ations
I had with our Pilots, gave
me the Advantage of taking notice of
all the Circum&s;tances I thought nece&s;&s;ary
to Sailing; And I am not to omit,
that the long abode I have made in
divers Parts, giving me a real Ta&s;te
of the Plea&s;ure there is in &s;eeing Foreign
Countries; I have with all imaginable
Exactne&s;s enquir'd into the Commerce
of the Place, the particular Intere&s;ts
of each Colony, the Strength, Situation,
and Advantages of the Ports; the Man|ners,
<PB REF="6">
Cu&s;toms, and Religion of the Peo|ple;
and la&s;tly, the Nature of tho&s;e
Fruits, Plants, Birds, Fi&s;hes, and the
Animals that &s;eem'd to have any thing
extraordinary in or peculiar to them,
and the&s;e I have &s;et out in the be&s;t
manner I cou'd, by a great many Cop|per-Cuts,
all of them re&s;pectively fixed in
their proper Places.</P>
<P>But I have more particularly apply'd
my &s;elf to make Charts of the Entrances
of Harbours and Rivers, either of my
&s;elf, as I have had Lea&s;ure for it, as
may be &s;een in tho&s;e I have given of
<HI>Gambia, Rio-Janeiro,</HI> and <HI>All-Saints</HI>-Bay,
as by reforming the Charts or Me|moirs
that have been taken of the Streight
of <HI>Magellan,</HI> of the di&s;emboguings of the
I&s;les of <HI>Antilles,</HI> and of the Government
of <HI>Cayenne,</HI> that hath not yet appear'd
in the World, under the Name of <HI>Aequi|noctial
France,</HI> in that Extent, and
with tho&s;e Limits I have &s;et it forth by.</P>
<P>I hope this Relation will meet with
&s;o much the more favourable Reception,
&s;eeing I have retrencht it of tho&s;e te|dious
Particulars wherewith others of this
kind are u&s;ually &s;tuffed, and have made
u&s;e of all the Exactne&s;s and Simplicity
that a Work requires that has no other
<PB REF="7">
than Truth for its End, and wherein
the Reader will have the plea&s;ure either
of &s;eeing new De&s;criptions, or his Judg|ment
regulated in re&s;pect of tho&s;e he has
already &s;een el&s;ewhere; and la&s;tly, an
orderly View given of all the unfortunate

<P>On the 7th. In&s;tant at Eleven of the

three or four Leagues under the Wind,
two Ve&s;&s;els, which the <HI>Felicity</HI> went to

<P>On the 9th. we had &s;ight of another

gave cha&s;e to, during four Hours:
The latter, which came very near her,
inform'd us, that &s;he &s;eem'd to be a <HI>Sal|ly-Man,</HI>

<P><PB N="3" REF="8">
On the 10th. at Noon, we made 15

which follow'd us from <HI>Rochel.</HI></P>
<P>On the 15th. at four a-Clock in the

which came up to view us within three
Cannon-&s;hot, and afterward tack'd about
again; whereupon we gave her Chace,
till the darkne&s;s of the Night caus'd us
to lo&s;e the &s;ight of her.</P>
<P>On the 21th. at Sun-Ri&s;ing, we di&s;co|ver'd

<P>On the 22th.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The I&s;land of <HI>Madera.</HI></NOTE> at 11 a-clock at Night,
we lo&s;t the Shallop with Decks, which
<HI>M. de Gennes</HI> had caus'd to be built, on
purpo&s;e to throw out the Bombs: For as
&s;he was tacking about, whil&s;t the Sea
ran very high, her Cable broke, and &s;he
was driven out of her Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>On the 26th. at three a-clock in the

beyond that Ve&s;&s;el without di&s;cerning
her, by rea&s;on that &s;he was very low

<P>On the 3d. we di&s;cover'd <HI>Cape Verd,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cape Verd.</NOTE>

with a Pre&s;ent of an Ox, and two Do|zen
of Pullets. The Per&s;on who brought
this Pre&s;ent told us, That the Ve&s;&s;els of
the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company pa&s;s'd by a lit|tle
while ago, and that an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> De|&s;erter
had inform'd them, That almo&s;t
the whole Garri&s;on of <HI>Gambia</HI> was fall'n
&s;ick, and wanted Provi&s;ions; which
piece of News was &s;o well confirm'd to
<HI>M. de Gennes,</HI> even by the Relation of
the Governour him&s;elf; that if the <HI>Se|ditious</HI>
and the <HI>Fruitful</HI> had come up
with us, we &s;hould have &s;et &s;ail the
<PB N="5" REF="9">
very next day, in order to be&s;iege the
Fort, before the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> could have had
any notice of our Arrival.</P>
<P>In the mean while, waiting till tho&s;e
Ships appear'd, we diverted our &s;elves,
&s;ome in Hunting, and others in Fi&s;hing;
nay we met with &s;ufficient variety of
Diverti&s;ements, not very expen&s;ive,
without leaving the Villages. The Ne|groes
came continually on board with
their<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Pirogues.</NOTE> Ve&s;&s;els full of Fi&s;h, which they
gave us in exchange for Knives, Sheets
of Paper, little pieces of Iron, and o|ther
Toys of the like nature: We al&s;o
pierc'd &s;ome Barrels of Wine, and &s;et|ting
a&s;ide the Heat of the Weather,
which was exce&s;&s;ive, the Sports and Pa|&s;times
abated a great deal of the Impati|ence
that we had to go to <HI>Gambia.</HI></P>
<P>On the fifth In&s;tant, <HI>M. de Gennes,</HI>
M. <HI>du Parc,</HI> and the Governour of <HI>Go|rea,</HI>
went to give a Vi&s;it to the <HI>Alcaty</HI>
or Governour of a Village call'd <HI>The
Gap,</HI> &s;ituate on the Sea-&s;hore, near a
&s;mall Mar&s;h, being the only place where
fre&s;h Water can be taken in; upon
which account the <HI>Alcaty</HI> &s;uffers none
to do it, till an Agreement be made be|forehand,
to give him a Bottle of Bran|dy
for every Shallop. He receiv'd the&s;e
<PB N="6" REF="10">
Gentlemen very courteou&s;ly, and grant|ed
their Reque&s;ts upon good Terms.</P>
<P>The next Day M. <HI>de Gennes</HI> invited to
Dinner the Governour of <HI>Gorea,</HI> the a|fore&s;aid
<HI>Alcaty</HI> of <HI>Gap,</HI> and another <HI>Al|caty</HI>
of a neighbouring Village, who
was the Brother of a Favourite of the
King of <HI>Houmel,</HI> and otherwi&s;e in great
e&s;teem for his Magnanimity, and for
being one of the mo&s;t robu&s;t and well-&s;et
Men of the Country. The <HI>Alcaty</HI>
of <HI>Rufi&s;ca</HI> was al&s;o pre&s;ent, by chance,
with a Negro Lady, the Widow of a
certain <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> who had one of
the chief Places in the Kingdom:
This Lady had excellent Features,
was endow'd with a generous Di&s;po&s;i|tion,
and of a very obliging Deport|ment;
being of a middle-&s;iz'd Sta|ture,
and cloath'd after the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI>
Fa&s;hion. M. <HI>du Gennes</HI> treated them all
magnificently, and made them &s;ome &s;mall
Pre&s;ents: He was al&s;o de&s;irous to divert
them with a Volly of Cannon and Mu&s;|ket-&s;hot:
But Dinner was &s;carce ended,
when they earne&s;tly importun'd to be
di&s;mi&s;s'd. The cau&s;e of their &s;udden
Departure being unknown to us, we
were not a little &s;urpriz'd, in regard that
they had no rea&s;on to be tir'd with the
<PB N="7" REF="10">
Company; till the Governour of <HI>Gorea</HI>
told us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Super&s;tition of the Ne|gro's.</NOTE> That apparently they had oc|ca&s;ion
to ea&s;e them&s;elves, and that a Su|per&s;titious
Cu&s;tom prevail'd among 'em,
never to do it at Sea.</P>
<P>On the 9th. In&s;tant, our Shallop be|ing
fitted out to take in fre&s;h Water, a
Storm of Wind aro&s;e, which threw
her on the Coa&s;t: She &s;uffer'd little
Dammage, by rea&s;on that the Shock
happen'd on the Sand: Neverthele&s;s
this Accident was like to have occa&s;i|on'd
a great Conte&s;t with the Negroes,
who gave it out, That one Moiety of
the Ve&s;&s;els that run a-ground on their
Coa&s;ts, ought to be appropriated to
their U&s;e: And even the Governour of
<HI>Gorea</HI> him&s;elf acknowledg'd, that they
had a Right to &s;uch a Claim: But for|a&s;much
as this Law was made only in
reference to Merchant-Ships, we &s;peedi|ly
&s;et &s;ome of our Men on Shore, to
&s;tand upon their Guard; and for far|ther
Security, retain'd &s;even or eight
Negroes, who were come on board to
trade with Fi&s;h: In the mean while, our
Carpenters wrought during the whole
Night; and the next Day in the After|noon
our Shallop return'd laden with
Water, and as &s;ound as before.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="11">
On the 13th. at two a-clock, two Ve&s;|&s;els
appear'd, whil&s;t our <HI>Corvette</HI> was
&s;ailing to the Village of <HI>Ru&s;i&s;ca;</HI> where|upon
we di&s;charg'd a Cannon to cau&s;e
her to return, and to recal all the Mariners
on board: We likewi&s;e made Signals to
the other Ships, which were an&s;wer'd
by them. They were the <HI>Seditious</HI> and
the <HI>Fruitful</HI> Pinks, which came to join
with us again, after having waited for
our Arrival eleven Days at <HI>Madera:</HI>
They ca&s;t Anchor at two a-clock, and
the next Day our <HI>Corvette</HI> &s;et out a &s;e|cond
time for <HI>Rufi&s;ca,</HI> to get &s;ome Pro|vi&s;ions,
that were nece&s;&s;ary for our de|parture

<P>Before we leave <HI>Gorea,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The De&s;cri|ption of the I&s;land of <HI>Gorea.</HI></NOTE> it may not be

relate what I have &s;een and heard con|cerning
the Nature of the Coa&s;t, and the
Traffick and Manners of the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>The I&s;land of <HI>Gorea</HI> is di&s;tant only
one League from the Continent, four
from Cape <HI>Verd,</HI> and may be about
half a League in Compa&s;s. The <HI>Hol|landers</HI>
fir&s;t fix'd a Colony therein, and
built the Forts of St. <HI>Francis</HI> and St. <HI>Mi|chael,</HI>
which are &s;till to be &s;een: After|ward
the Count <HI>d' Etr&eacute;es</HI> made him&s;elf
Ma&s;ter of the Place <HI>A. D.</HI> 1678: The
<PB N="9" REF="11">
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> took it from the <HI>French</HI> in 1692.
and demoli&s;h'd the Forts which were e|rected
by the <HI>Hollanders:</HI> At la&s;t the
<HI>Senegal</HI> Company, having re-taken it in
1693, rebuilt St. <HI>Michael</HI>'s Fort: And
there are at pre&s;ent in this I&s;land about
100 <HI>Frenchmen,</HI> with &s;ome Families of
<HI>Lapto's</HI> or free Negro's, who are hir'd
by the Company to trade from one
Coa&s;t to another.</P>
<P>The Sea-Coa&s;t is flat, &s;andy, and in
many places very barren: The Soil
brings forth Millet, Rice, Tobacco, and
&s;ome Fruits, which are all generally ve|ry
in&s;ipid: The Country is every where
be&s;et with a &s;ort of wild Apple or Crab-Trees,
that grow as thick as Broom in
a Heath or Warren: There are al&s;o cer|tain
&s;mall Shrubs, which are very com|mon;
their Fruit, call'd <HI>Mandanaza</HI> by
the Negro's, being no bigger than a
&s;mall Nut, exactly re&s;embles an Apri|cock
in Shape and Colour: It is of a
very grateful Ta&s;te, but very unwhol|&s;om:
Its Leaf is like that of Ivy, but
of a &s;omewhat lighter Green. I have
&s;een there a &s;ort of Trees not unlike
our Plum-Trees, the Fruit of which has
the Colour, Bigne&s;s, and almo&s;t Ta&s;te
of our Cherries; 'Tis call'd <HI>Caho&uuml;ar;</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="12">
and I have caus'd the Figure of it to be
drawn, becau&s;e it appear'd to me to be
very remarkable. The Negro's made a
Pre&s;ent to us, as a choice Banquet, of
certain large Fruits that re&s;emble &s;mall
Gourds, but under the Skin, is only a
kind of Sub&s;tance like dre&s;s'd Flax:
They cau&s;e them to be roa&s;ted under
Embers, and afterward chew them to
&s;uck out the Juice, which is as yellow
as Saffron: This Fruit has a Stone as
large as an Egg, and as hard as Iron.
In the Country there is a great number
of Palm-Trees, out of which the Ne|gro's

was held about that An&s;wer; and for|a&s;much
as it was well known, that in
the beginning of the War, he had &s;eiz'd
on Merchandizes to the value of above
40000 Crowns, belonging to the <HI>French</HI>
who traded on that River; it was
determin'd to make a De&s;cent upon the
Country, to take the King Pri&s;oner, and
as many Negroes as cou'd be catched;
and to burn all their Hutts. This De|cree
was ready to be put in execution,
when an <HI>Alcaty</HI> came to pa&s;s a Com|pliment
upon M. <HI>de Gennes,</HI> and to a&s;|&s;ure
him, that the King was unwilling
to engage in a War again&s;t him; on the
contrary, that he was very de&s;irous
to keep an amicable Corre&s;pondence
<PB N="27" REF="23">
with him; and that he might freely take
whatever he &s;hould think fit.</P>
<P>The next Day, M. <HI>de Gennes</HI> went to
give a Vi&s;it to the King; the principal
Officers walk'd before him to his Ca|noo,
and conducted him to the Place
where the Interview was to be made.
The King appear'd a little while after,
without any regular Train, in the mid&s;t
of a great number of Negroes, and at|tended
with &s;ome Drummers: He was
of a very advantageous Stature, and was
cloath'd with a red Doublet be&s;et with
the Tails of Wild Bea&s;ts, and little Bells.
He had on his Head an O&s;ier-Cap, a|dorn'd
with divers Rows of Coral, and
two Ox-Horns. Here we may ob&s;erve
by the way, that Circumci&s;ed Per&s;ons in
tho&s;e Parts, have the liberty to wear
&s;uch a Cap, during eight Days imme|diately
after their Circumci&s;ion, by ver|tue
of which, they are authoriz'd to
commit all manner of Crimes imagina|ble,
with impunity, and none dur&s;t com|plain
of their outragious Villainies. The
King in this pompous Equipage, hold|ing
a Pipe in his Mouth, walk'd with
a Maje&s;tick Gate under a &s;tately Tree,
where he u&s;ually gives Audience to the
Amba&s;&s;adors of the neighbouring Princes.
<PB N="28" REF="24">
M. <HI>de Gennes</HI> went thither to &s;alute him,
and made him a Pre&s;ent of 20 Bars of
Iron, a Barrel of Brandy, a Pair of Pi|&s;tols,
and a Burning-Gla&s;s, with the Ef|fects
of which he was extremely &s;ur|priz'd.
The Interpreter being a <HI>French|man</HI>
who dwelt on the River above ten
Years, &s;poke the Language of the Coun|try
very fluently; by which means their
Conver&s;ation was continu'd for a con&s;i|derable
time; and among other things,
this poor King often enquir'd whether
he was much talk'd of in <HI>France?</HI> Af|ter
a great deal of Di&s;cour&s;e of the like
nature, they parted; but the King cau|&s;ed
M. <HI>de Gennes</HI> to be reconducted by for|ty
Men of his own Guards, and &s;everal
Drummers, and pre&s;ented him with &s;ome
of the fine&s;t Oxen that could be found
in the Village.</P>
<P>On the 30th. In&s;tant, a Council was
held to determine, whether the Fort
&s;hould be kept or &s;lighted: The latter
Advice was follow'd for divers Rea&s;ons,
and therefore we drew near, to take all
the Merchandizes that were to be ex|ported
in our Ve&s;&s;els: They con&s;i&s;ted

Acce&s;s difficult: There are above 500
Inhabitants capable of bearing Arms, and
a great number of Negro-Slaves. The
Fathers <HI>Cordeliers</HI> have a Church there.
The <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> of this I&s;land, as all the o|ther
of the I&s;lands of Cape <HI>Verd,</HI> are of a
&s;warthy Complexion, but they are ingeni|ous
People, and very &s;ociable: They feed
on a kind of Bread made of Millet and
<HI>Banana's.</HI> They have numerous Herds
of Oxen, A&s;&s;es, Goats, and Hogs, with
variety of Fowl; Their Wine is al&s;o
good, and their Fruits excellent; in&s;o|much
that this I&s;land, where the Air
is healthful, and always temperate, may

Crew had known that they &s;hou'd have
met with &s;o good Company, they wou'd

were not aware of us till it was too late
to retreat; and if they had prov'd <HI>En|gli&s;hmen,</HI>
they might have paid dear e|nough

is &s;o much the more curious, in regard
that it is made of fine Cotton, and hung

we receiv'd ten Cannon-&s;hot more,

<HI>Froward</HI>) drove us on the Coa&s;ts, in|&s;omuch
that four Shallops were not a|ble
to get us clear of the Shore. We
let fall a large Anchor, which very
much abated the force of the Cur|rent,

a-float, by rea&s;on that the bottom
not being firm, cou'd not hold it. We

<P>On the 17th. and 18th. we had foul

<P>On the 26th. the Weather was very

On the 16th. we di&s;cover'd Cape
<HI>Frie,</HI> but were not able to double it,
becau&s;e there was very little Wind
&s;tirring. About eight a-clock in the
Evening, the Sky being very &s;erene,
we di&s;cern'd the Moon to be in an
Eclip&s;e, that continu'd almo&s;t for the
&s;pace of two Hours, and which in|deed
was not fore&s;een by us, in re|gard
that we did not meet with any
Almanacks in the Straight of <HI>Magel|lan,</HI>
where the Inhabitants, although
great Star-gazers, do not reap the
Fruits of their Ob&s;ervations. About
two a-clock in the Morning, we de|&s;cry'd
a Ve&s;&s;el under the Wind, and
&s;ome gave it out that there were
two: Whereupon we prepar'd our Bat|teries,
and kept the Weather-gage du|ring
the whole Night. At break of
Day, we perceiv'd it to be a <HI>Portu|gue&s;e</HI>
Bark, which a Storm had dri|ven
from the Mouth of the River
<HI>Jan&euml;iro:</HI> The Mariners belonging to
this. Ve&s;&s;el inform'd us, that the Fleet
was arriv'd, and that the Governor was
chang'd, but that he heard no News
of our Ships. We freely be&s;tow'd on
them two Barrels of Water, of which
they were de&s;titute two Days, and were
<PB N="90" REF="68">
not able to make Land, to take in any.</P>
<P>On the 19th. we doubl'd Cape <HI>Frie,</HI>
and on the 20th. we ca&s;t Anchor with|in
&s;even Leagues of <HI>Rio-Janeiro;</HI> but
we had not &s;o much as one bla&s;t of
Wind, and the Currents were contrary.
There we &s;aw Two of tho&s;e Pillars of
Water that ari&s;e out of the Sea, and
which are commonly call'd <HI>Spouts:</HI>
When they draw near, 'tis cu&s;tomary
to di&s;charge &s;everal Cannon-&s;hot, to di|&s;per&s;e
them, and by that means the dan|ger
is often e&s;cap'd.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t. we put out to Sea,
and the next Day we ca&s;t Anchor,
within two Leagues of the Coa&s;t, be|fore
the Mouth of the River, but we
determin'd not to enter it, by rea&s;on
that our Place of Meeting was appoint|ed
to be at <HI>La I&s;la Grande.</HI></P>
<P>On the 24th. we prepar'd to &s;et Sail
again, when the Rocks cut our Cable,
and &s;av'd us the trouble of weighing
Anchor; and &s;o little Wind was &s;tir|ring
in the Night, that at break of Day
we found our &s;elves driven by the
Currents under Cape <HI>Frie,</HI> which made
us take a Re&s;olution to &s;tand in for
the I&s;lands of St. <HI>Ann,</HI> to wait for a
fair Wind, as al&s;o to take in fre&s;h Wa|ter
<PB N="91" REF="68">
and Provi&s;ions, of which we had a
very &s;hort Allowance. Thus we ca&s;t
Anchor on the 26th. In&s;tant at Noon,
and found the I&s;land as full of Fowl as
at our fir&s;t Arrival.</P>
<P>On the 27th. we &s;ent our Boat a|&s;hore
to take in Provi&s;ions, and to get
Information about our Ve&s;&s;els: We
purchas'd &s;ix Oxen, two Hoggs, and
&s;ome Pullets, but not without a great
deal of Difficulty, by rea&s;on that all the
Provi&s;ions were tran&s;ported to <HI>Rio Ja|neiro,</HI>
for the u&s;e of the Fleet: We
were al&s;o inform'd, that our Ships
had enter'd that River twenty Days
ago.</P>
<P>On the 29th. at five a-clock in the
Evening, we &s;et Sail with a favourable
Wind, and order'd the Pink to carry
the Lanthorn: We follow'd her for
&s;ome time, but fora&s;much as &s;he &s;ail'd
too near the Coa&s;t, and the Night was
dark, we left her to continue her Cour&s;e,
and &s;tood &s;omewhat farther out to Sea.</P>
<P>On the 30th. at break of Day, we
weather'd Cape <HI>Frie,</HI> and found the
Winds and Currents contrary as be|fore.
At the &s;ame time, we di&s;cern'd
the Pink four large Leagues to the
Windward of us; neverthele&s;s (as
<PB N="96" REF="69">
we were afterwards inform'd) &s;he conti|nu'd
at Sea eight Days longer, before
&s;he could find means to enter the
River.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of that Day, and the next,
we had but little Wind, and that too
was contrary; in&s;omuch that after di|vers
fruitle&s;s Attempts, Mon&s;ieur <HI>de
Gennes</HI> judg'd, that for the future we
ought not to be ob&s;tinately re&s;olv'd
to pur&s;ue our intended Cour&s;e, le&s;t we
&s;hould be reduc'd to the greate&s;t Ex|tremity;
but that 'twas more expedi|ent
to &s;tand in for the Bay of <HI>All-Saints;</HI>
&s;ince by &s;ailing thither, we
&s;hould get &s;o far onward in our Way,
and we &s;hould certainly meet with
plenty of Provi&s;ions in that Place.</P>
<P>Therefore we ca&s;t Anchor <HI>June</HI> the

&s;ufficient only to &s;erve for eight
Days at mo&s;t; and fora&s;much as it was
requi&s;ite to give notice to our Ve&s;&s;els
of the Cour&s;e that we had determin'd
to &s;teer, we &s;ent an Officer a-&s;hore to
de&s;ire a Pa&s;&s;-port of the Commander of
the Town, to go to <HI>Rio-Janeiro</HI> by Land,
to acquaint them with our De&s;ign:
<PB N="97" REF="69">
the Officer who had received Orders to
return the &s;ame Evening, not appearing
by next Day Noon; Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Gennes</HI>
believing &s;ome Misfortune had befallen
him, &s;ent out a Shallop armed with
two &s;mall Guns, to get Intelligence,
which return'd to us again about Five
in the Evening: And the Men reported,
That they had &s;een the Canoe in the
River, where there were Dwelling-places;
and that the Officer who ap|peared
on Shoar, came up to the point
of Land there, in Order to give them
Notice to return, becau&s;e it was &s;hal|low
Water, and that he had pa&s;&s;ed over
a Ridge of Rocks where the Surge of
the Sea was very frightful; and that
this was the Rea&s;on, together with his
tarrying for three Beefs they were
in que&s;t of for us, that detained our Ca|noe
from returning to us.</P>
<P>The Shallop went back next Day,
about ten of the Clock, and as &s;he was
ready to enter in, the Officer who had
&s;ent her back the Day before, gave
them a Signal to come to an Anchor,
and to wait till the Tide came in. They
continued in that Po&s;ture till two a
Clock in the Afternoon; when the Of|ficer
that commanded, grown quite
<PB N="98" REF="70">
weary with &s;taying, made u&s;e both of
his Sails and Oars, and put forwards;
and that in &s;pight of the Advice of the
Ma&s;ter, and of all the Signals that
could be made from the Shoar to the
contrary: But he was no &s;ooner incom|moded
with the terrible Rocks afore|mentioned,
than that he began to re|pent
(tho' it was now too late) of his
Ra&s;hne&s;s. After they had bore divers
rude Attacks of the Sea, a Wave brought
all their Oars on one &s;ide, and this Wave
was followed by another, that opened the
Shallop in the very middle, and drown|ed
the Commander,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Shallop lo&s;t.</NOTE> with &s;even Seamen
more; but the Ma&s;ter, together with
the Gunner and &s;even other Mariners,
&s;aved them&s;elves, and remained on
Shoar to &s;eek out their Comrades Bo|dies.</P>
<P>That &s;ame Evening our Canoe came
to inform us of this &s;orrowful News;
and withal, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for
us to pa&s;s over the Territories of the
<HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> to go to <HI>Rio-Janeiro,</HI> becau&s;e
the Governour had given Orders at <HI>Cape

<P>On the 4th we &s;ung Ma&s;s for the

<P>Next Day, which was the &s;ixth,

<PB N="100" REF="72">
ready to &s;ail for the Bay of <HI>All-Saints,</HI>

<P>On the 7th and 8th we &s;teer'd a

forty Leagues into the Sea, and on
which divers Ships have peri&s;hed. The

with them, make no great Difficulty
of &s;ailing through the mid&s;t of them;
and &s;o &s;ave a large Compa&s;s that others
are oblig'd to make, to avoid them.
We &s;aw a great Whale the Day fol|lowing,
that went round our Ship &s;e|veral
times, and twice under it.</P>
<P>We were on the 10th, 11th, and 12th.
troubled with exce&s;&s;ive Heats, and had
but very little Wind; at what time
we catch'd a great Number of <HI>Requins,</HI>
which was a con&s;iderable help to leng|then
out our Provi&s;ions: But tho' this
Fi&s;h appears to be firm Fle&s;h enough,
yet it is &s;o in&s;ipid that &s;everal of our

<PB N="101" REF="72">
It's thick, and five or &s;ix Foot long,
a great Lover of Man's Fle&s;h, has a

has two or three &s;mall Fi&s;hes near him
that are his Pilots, and never for&s;ake
him, but &s;erve to &s;ecure him from be|ing
&s;urprized by the Whale.</P>
<P>There is a &s;ort of Fi&s;h which they
call <HI>Sucet,</HI> that is commonly fa&s;tened
to the <HI>Requin,</HI> and this has given many
Men occa&s;ion to believe that he is his
Pilot; but herein they are mi&s;taken,
for this &s;mall Fi&s;h never clo&s;es with
the other, but when he finds him&s;elf
pur&s;ued; and then taking half a turn
round, he &s;trikes the <HI>Requin</HI> over the

pa&s;&s;ed over the Shallows of St. <HI>Antony.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="73">

made fa&s;t together, whereon two Men
go out a fi&s;hing to the extent of two

but we could never bring them to con|duct
us to the Road, they alledging,
they were forbid to do it; but I be|lieve
it was becau&s;e they would not
leave their fi&s;hing.</P>
<P>But it fortunately happen'd, that we
de&s;cry'd two &s;orts of &s;mall Tartanes,
that were for making the be&s;t of their
way into the Bay as well as we; them
we waited for, and required them to
grant us a Pilot for our Money; upon
which, one of the Ma&s;ters of the&s;e
Tartanes, offered him&s;elf to conduct us
to the Place where we were to An|chor,
and this he performed with all
imaginable Civility: We drew up in
Order, within Cannon Shot of Cape
St. <HI>Antony,</HI> and about five in the Even|ing
ca&s;t Anchor within a &s;mall League

the King had given him Orders

hereupon, &s;ent to &s;ee for his Shallop,

tenders of his Service to us, he
accompanied the Chevalier <HI>de Fontenay</HI>
to wait upon the Governour, with
whom he had no long Di&s;pute, for they
quickly agreed not to &s;alute one ano|ther
at all, which made mo&s;t of the <HI>Por|tugue&s;e</HI>
to murmur, and concernedly to
&s;ay, That it was not to be endured,
that a <HI>Frenchman</HI> &s;hould pa&s;s under

yet not be called to an Account for it:
But 'tis well known, they are no other|wi&s;e

<P>The Morrow being <HI>The Fea&s;t of God,</HI>

dozen or fifteen of his own Men, threw
him&s;elf into the Sea, where they floated
upon Ma&s;ts for five Days and five
Nights, and at la&s;t got a-&s;hoar half dead

<P>On the 4th of <HI>July,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">July, 1696</NOTE> the Admiral
with divers Merchant Ships, anchored

carried one of them &s;ixty Guns, and

<P>We drew nearer to the City on the

for the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Fleet had
made it exce&s;&s;ive dear, but now we
bought &s;ome <HI>European</HI> Meal, Magniot,

<P>As for the City of St. <HI>Salvador,</HI> that

This City, to the Seaward, is de|fended
with &s;ome Forts, and &s;everal
Batteries mounted with Cannon, and
to the Landward, with earthen Ba&s;tions
ill made. We &s;aw them lay the Foun|dation
of a Fortre&s;s, the Governour had
ordered to be erected about half a Can|non
&s;hot without the Town: The
<HI>Dutch</HI> attempted divers times to make
them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of this Place, but
without Succe&s;s, tho' they have taken

thence at one clap.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants, to &s;ay nothing of
the common People, who are in&s;olent
to the highe&s;t Degree, are neat, civil,
and hone&s;t, and withal rich, being lo|vers
of Trade, and for the mo&s;t part
are of a Jewi&s;h Extract; and this is
the Rea&s;on, that when any one of the
Inhabitants is about to make one of his
Sons a Divine, he is obliged to prove
his Ance&s;tors were Chri&s;tians, as the
Knights of <HI>Malta</HI> are under an Obliga|tion
of making out their Gentility, be|fore
they enter into the Order. They
love Women extreamly, and &s;pare no
Charges for the &s;etting out of their
Wives, who in re&s;pect to all other
things, have Cau&s;e enough to complain;
<PB N="110" REF="77">
for they are never allowed to &s;ee any
Body, and go not out of doors at any
other time but on <HI>Sunday</HI> early in the
Morning, to go to Church: They are
a very jealous People, and 'tis a kind
of a point of Honour for a Man to &s;tab
his Wife, when he can convict her
of being unfaithful to his Bed; tho' for
all that, this cannot hinder many of
them from finding out a way to impart
&s;ome of their Favours to us <HI>Frenchmen,</HI>
who&s;e winning and free Conver&s;ation
they are mightily in love with.</P>
<P>As the Town is nothing throughout
but up's and downs, and that con&s;e|quently
Carriages are very impractica|ble
there; their Slaves are forced to
perform what Hor&s;es &s;hould otherwi&s;e
do, and carry the heavie&s;t &s;ort of Goods
from one place unto another: And 'tis
al&s;o for the &s;ame Rea&s;on, that a thing
they call a Palanquin is much in u&s;e
there; it's nothing el&s;e but a kind of
a Sedan, covered over with a little
embroidered Canopy, and carried by
two Negro's by the help of a long Pole,
whereunto it's fa&s;tned at both ends:
Per&s;ons of Quality are carried therein
to Church, to make their Vi&s;its, and
al&s;o into the Fields. The Hou&s;es are
<PB N="111" REF="77">
high-built, and mo&s;t of them of Free-&s;tone
and Brick; their Churches are
very &s;umptuous, being finely gilt, full
of Silver-plate, Sculptures, and a va&s;t
Number of the be&s;t Ornaments that are
to be met with: And as for the Cathe|dral-Church
there, dedicated to the
Cro&s;s, the Lamps and Candle&s;ticks are
&s;o high, and ma&s;&s;y withal, that two
Men can &s;carce carry them.</P>
<P>They have &s;everal &s;orts of Religious
Orders among&s;t them; as <HI>Franci&s;cans,
Carmelites, Benedictines, Je&s;uits,</HI> and
divers others, and all of them, except
a little Convent of <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Italian
Capuchins,</HI> are very rich; and more
particularly, the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> are very potent
there, they being no le&s;s than 190 in
Number, their Hou&s;e of a va&s;t Extent,
and their Church large and well beau|tified:
Their Ve&s;try is one of the mo&s;t
Magnificent that ever was &s;een, it's
about an hundred and fifty Foot long,
and of proportionable Breadth: They
have three Altars in it, two whereof are
placed at the two ends, and the third
in the mid&s;t of that part that joins to
the Church; and upon which may be
&s;een, every Morning, above twenty
Calices, all of them made of Gold, Ver|million,
<PB N="112" REF="78">
and Silver; on each &s;ide of this
la&s;t Altar &s;tand two great Tables, that
are of that length, that there is room
only left for two doors to open, by which
they enter into the Church. The&s;e two
Tables are made of very fine Wood,
the whole Surface of them being ador|ned
with Ivory, a &s;ort of Net-work,
and a great many fine Water-colour
Paintings, that are brought thither
from <HI>Rome.</HI> The fourth &s;ide of this
Ve&s;try, that &s;tands to the Seaward, is
pierced with divers large Cro&s;&s;es from
top to bottom, and the Ceiling very
curiou&s;ly painted.</P>
<P>The Soyl here is flat or level, wa|tered
with fine Rivers, on which the <HI>Por|tugue&s;e</HI>
inhabit for above fifty Leagues
into the Country, who&s;e Dominion the
<HI>Indians</HI> &s;hun, and for that end retire into
the Woods; but they &s;teal their Cattle
continually, and eat them them&s;elves
when they can catch them: Our <HI>Capu|chins,</HI>
who (as we have already ob&s;er|ved)
have a Convent in this City, have
travelled four or five Years among the&s;e
poor People, and expos'd them&s;elves
with an Apo&s;tolical Zeal, to all &s;orts of
Fatigues, in order to reduce them from
their Blindne&s;s and Ignorance.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="78">
The Earth produces Sugar-Canes, To|bacco,
Cotton, Magniot-Roots, Rice,
Maes, and &s;uch good Pa&s;turage, that
they breed &s;o great a Number of Cattle,
that Meat is &s;old there under a Penny
a Pound; but the Country is &s;o pe&s;tered
with Ants, that they are con&s;trained,
for the pre&s;erving of their Fields of
Maes and Magniot, to carry them to
feed upon the Roads: And tho&s;e who
are curious in Gardening, mu&s;t, by the
help of &s;everal &s;mall Channels, form an
I&s;land of every Bed, to drown the Ants
in their Pa&s;&s;age over. They have Pul&s;e
and Fruits there in abundance, &s;uch as
they call the <HI>Banane, Ananas, Patatoes,
Ighname, Cocoe,</HI> and <HI>Goyave,</HI> of which
we have given a De&s;cription already.</P>
<P>Here they have al&s;o Cinamon, Pep|per,
Ginger, the Oyl of <HI>Capahu,</HI> Bal&s;om,
and &s;everal &s;orts of Roots that have a
wonderful Effect; and among&s;t the re&s;t,
tho&s;e called <HI>Para-ayra-braba,</HI> and <HI>Hypo|pecovana.</HI>
The Cinnamon-tree is about
the Height of a &s;mall Cherry-tree,
bearing long Leaves, and pointed at the
end, of a bright green Colour; the <HI>Je|&s;uits</HI>
were the fir&s;t that brought them
thither out of <HI>Ceylan,</HI> of which they
took great Care: But in &s;ome Years
<PB N="114" REF="79">
they grew very common, becau&s;e that
the Birds who eat the Fruit thereof,
&s;ow the Seed up and down every-where,
being not able to dige&s;t it. The Plant
which bears the Pepper, clings round
about to other Trees like Ivy, has pret|ty
large Leaves, pointed at the ends,
and of a deep green; and the Fruit it
produces are &s;mall Grapes, like tho&s;e
growing on the wild Vine.</P>
<P>The <HI>Capahu-Oyle</HI> and the Bal&s;om,
come from the Juri&s;diction of <HI>Spiritu
Sancto;</HI> tho&s;e they draw from certain
Trees, where the wild Bea&s;ts by rub|ing
again&s;t their Bark, cure them&s;elves
of their Wounds; for let them take off
never &s;o little of them, the&s;e Liquors
will gu&s;h out, and have &s;o much the
more admirable Effect, in that they are
not adulterated, as tho&s;e we have in
<HI>Europe</HI> are. The <HI>Para-ayra-braba,</HI> is a
thick hard Root, which is made u&s;e
of as an infallible Remedy again&s;t all
&s;orts of Poy&s;ons: And as for the <HI>Hypo|pecovana</HI>
it's a &s;mall Root, that in our
Armies has &s;ufficiently di&s;covered the
Vertues of it again&s;t the Bloody-flux,
being valued at ten Pi&s;toles a Pound;
but now it's cheaper, as being more
common.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="79">
Among tho&s;e that are curious, you
&s;hall find very large Oranges, that ori|ginally
were brought from the <HI>Mogul</HI>
Country; according to which they have
their Names, and &s;ome whereof are
eight Inches Diameter. They have a
&s;ort of Ro&s;es growing among&s;t them,
who&s;e Leaves are very like unto tho&s;e
of <HI>Guimauva,</HI> and the Fruit whereof is
very &s;ingular, being white from Mid|night
till Noon, and from Noon to
Mid-night again of a red Colour.</P>
<P>They have abundance of wild Fowl
in that Country, and a great Number
of extraordinary Birds, and more e&s;pe|cially
the fine&s;t Parrots in the World;
to which may be added Tygers, Deer,
wild Boars, and &s;everal other Animals
that are unknown to us in <HI>Europe:</HI>
Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Gennes</HI> was pre&s;ented with
a very large Tortoi&s;e, that lived with|out
eating and drinking the re&s;t of the
Summer, under one of the Carriages
of our Cannon; and the&s;e are a &s;ort
of Animals that will never die till all
their Fat is entirely con&s;umed.</P>
<P>We ob&s;erved two &s;orts of Monkeys
there, which they di&s;tingui&s;hed by the

&s;ome of them being of a greyi&s;h

and of a Golden Hue; they are always
very merry and light&s;ome, but &s;o ten|der
that the lea&s;t Cold kills them:
The <HI>Macaques</HI> are larger, and of a
brown Colour, weep continually, and
are no otherwi&s;e diverting, but that
they will imitate every thing they &s;ee
you do; and we had one of them that
would make &s;ome of our Ship-tackle as
well as the Seamen them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> have already found
&s;ome Silver Mines there, and lately
Amethi&s;ts al&s;o; they have Bra&s;s enough

on the 17th of <HI>July</HI> came in a <HI>Portu|gue&s;e</HI>
Ship, belonging to the <HI>Guinea-Company,</HI>
lately erected among&s;t them,
which carried a white Flag with a Si|nople
or green Cro&s;s in it, and next

not expect to &s;ee till we came to <HI>Ca|yenne,</HI>
joined us; the <HI>Sun</HI> of <HI>Africa</HI>
gave us &s;even Guns, and we returned

<P>On the 22d we heard the good <HI>Ca|puchin</HI>

De&s;ires of his Superiour, as a Com|mand
from him, he &s;aid he was ready
to re-enter upon his Mi&s;&s;ion, and had
no farther Thoughts of his Native
Country.</P>
<P>Having, by the &s;ixth of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 1696</NOTE> ta|ken
in our Stores of Water and Wood,

found the Governour very civil, who
made a Pre&s;ent to all the Captains of
&s;ome <HI>Amethi&s;ts,</HI> and of all &s;orts of Re|fre&s;hments;
and the &s;eventh Day be|ing
come, we &s;ailed away, and having
doubled the Cape of St. <HI>Antony,</HI> we
kept our Cour&s;e out at Sea for &s;ome
Days, that we might &s;hun the Coa&s;t,
which, by rea&s;on of the Banks of Rocks,

there, is very dangerous.</P>
<P>On the 8<HI>th</HI> we de&s;cry'd two Barks,

bring us &s;ome News, becau&s;e there was
a Ship put in there the Day before.
But they proved to be Negro's, who
came to de&s;ire us to take them away
with us, or el&s;e they would commit
them&s;elves to the mercy of the Waves,
&s;ooner than they would return again
under the Tyranny of their Ma&s;ters;
but we &s;ent them back, that we might
not give the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Occa&s;ion to com|plain
of us, that we had taken away
their Slaves:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The mi&s;era|ble Condi|tion of the Negro Slaves.</NOTE> And in truth, the&s;e &s;ort

State; they are born Slaves, and they

are &s;carce able to lift up their hands to
their heads, but they make them work
at tilling the Ground as Oxen do: Be|&s;ides
they are ill-fed, and ba&s;tinado'd
for the lea&s;t Fault: They behold their
Children &s;old before their Faces, and
&s;ometimes their Wives: And this does
affect the greate&s;t part of tho&s;e who
have been bred up in the Chri&s;tian Re|ligion,
to that Degree, that they run
away from their Ma&s;ters, and chu&s;e
rather to go and die in the Woods
among the <HI>Indians,</HI> where they meet
with greater Humanity than with the
other: But this they mu&s;t execute with
the greate&s;t Precaution, for if their
Ma&s;ters once catch them, they give
them no Quarter; for they hang a great
Iron Collar about their Necks on each
&s;ide whereof there are Hooks, whereunto
is fa&s;tened a Stake or Branch of a
Tree, with which they thra&s;h them at
Plea&s;ure; and this they repeat &s;o often,
that they put them almo&s;t out of Con|dition
to follow their Work: But if it
&s;o happen, that after this &s;ort of Cha|&s;ti&s;ement
they relap&s;e again into the
&s;ame Fault, they without any more
ado, cut off one of their Legs, nay,
and &s;ometimes hang them for an Ex|ample
<PB N="120" REF="82">
of Terrour unto others; and tho'
all this is bad enough, yet the <HI>Spani|ards</HI>
and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> treat them &s;till in a
more cruel manner.</P>
<P>I knew one living in <HI>Martinico,</HI> who
being of a compa&s;&s;ionate Nature, could
not find in his heart to cut off his
Slave's Leg, who had run away four
or five times, but to the end he might
not again run the ri&s;que of lo&s;ing him
altogether, he bethought him&s;elf of
fa&s;tening a Chain to his Neck, which
trailing down backwards, catches up
his Leg behind, as may be &s;een by the
Cut: And this, in the &s;pace of two or
three Years, does &s;o contract the Nerves,
that it will be impo&s;&s;ible for this Slave
to make u&s;e of his Leg. And thus,
without running the Hazard of this
unhappy Wretch's Death, and without
doing him any Mi&s;chief, he thereby
deprived him of the means to make
his E&s;cape.</P>

&s;ix in the Evening; and on the
28th and 29th, we followed the &s;aid
Coa&s;t, at three or four Leagues di&s;tance
from the Shoar, and never found above
five or &s;ix Fathom Water.</P>
<P>On the 30th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cape of <HI>Orange.</HI></NOTE> about &s;even in the Mor|ning,
we de&s;cry'd the Cape of <HI>Orange,</HI>
where we began to &s;ee the Foot of the

we doubled a great Rock called
the <HI>Con&s;table,</HI> three Leagues out in the

at about half a Cannon &s;hot's di&s;tance,
and about &s;ix in the Evening came to
an Anchor, three Leagues to the North
of <HI>Cayenne</HI> before five little I&s;lands ly|ing
near to that place. When next Day
was come, Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Gennes</HI> &s;ent an
Officer to complement the Governour,
and to de&s;ire him to &s;end us a Pilot to
conduct us to a &s;a&s;e Anchorage; but
our Arrival had already allarm'd the

whole I&s;land, and they fired off their
Cannon all Night long, to give the In|habitants
Notice to come together; and
they would not tru&s;t to our Colours,
becau&s;e the <HI>Dutch</HI> in their Pa&s;&s;age to
<HI>Surinam</HI> and <HI>Barbicha,</HI> have often ca&s;t
Anchor within a League of the Town,
under white Colours; and as they had
not been u&s;ed to &s;ee four <HI>French</HI> Ships
at one time, they were apprehen&s;ive of
&s;ome De&s;ign upon them.</P>
<P>Our Shallop could not return before
next Day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sep. 1696.</NOTE> which happened to be the
fir&s;t of <HI>September,</HI> the &s;ame being oblig'd
to take a Cour&s;e round the I&s;land, for
avoiding the Currents, which are very
violent on that Coa&s;t; but &s;he brought
a Pilot along, tho' the Sea was &s;o &s;hal|low
that we were forced to tarry where
we were till the Day following: And
then on the &s;econd and third, we made as
much u&s;e of the Tide as po&s;&s;ibly we could,
in order to get in, becau&s;e there was &s;o
very little Water, and that we could not
make ready before it had half flowed:
But about four in the Evening, we ca&s;t
Anchor under the Cannon of the Town,
within Pi&s;tol-&s;hot of Land; there were
two Merchants Ships already in <HI>Cayenne,</HI>
that had waited &s;even or eight Months
<PB N="124" REF="85">
for their Cargo, be&s;ides another Ve&s;&s;el
that came in the Day before us, laden
with Wine and Brandy. As our Men
had, ju&s;t about this time, received a
Month's Pay, and that it was now a
long time &s;ince they had met with &s;o
good an Opportunity, they not only
drank up the Ship's whole Cargo in
eight Days time, but al&s;o all the Wine
they had in the I&s;land.</P>
<P><HI>Cayenne</HI> is a <HI>French</HI> I&s;land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The De|&s;cription of <HI>Cayenne.</HI></NOTE> &s;cituated on
the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guiana,</HI> four Degrees and
forty five Minutes North Latitude, and

to be about eighteen Leagues in
Circumference; it &s;tands high, upon
the Brink of the Sea, and is &s;o mar&s;hy
in the middle, that you cannot travel

the Fens of it are covered with a &s;ort

ri&s;e up, and are &s;o well interlaced one
with another, that in &s;ome places a

<P>The Town &s;tands on the We&s;t-part
of the I&s;land, and is very advantage|ou&s;ly
&s;cituated, Nature and Art having
both equally contributed to the forti|fying
of it: It's of an irregular Hexa|gone-Figure, has near &s;ixty pieces of
Cannon planted upon Batteries, for the
Security of it; and on the Sea-&s;ide, up|on
an Eminence, there is a Fort built
that commands every way: The Gar|ri&s;on
of the place con&s;i&s;ts of two Hun|dred
Regular Troops, but there are
above four Hundred Inhabitants living
either upon, or round about the I&s;land,
that upon the lea&s;t Alarm are oblig'd
to &s;tand to their Arms. Mon&s;ieur <HI>de
Feroles,</HI> the Governour, is a Per&s;on that
has great In&s;ight into the Affairs of a
Colony; the Power of di&s;tributing Ju|&s;tice
is ve&s;ted in him, and he is much
beloved by the Inhabitants: The <HI>Je|&s;uits</HI>
have a Church in the Town, and
a Chappel at the other end of the
I&s;land, for the Conveniency of tho&s;e
that live remote.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="86">
This I&s;land was formerly very un|healthy,
as well for the continual Rains
that fell there, for nine Months in the
Year, as becau&s;e the Ground was co|vered
with Wood, and withal very
mar&s;hy; Di&s;ea&s;es were very rife a|mong&s;t
them, and Infants u&s;ually died
almo&s;t as &s;oon as they were born; but
&s;ince the I&s;land has been grubbed up,
they have begun to grow more healthy,
the Women have good Lyings-in, and
their Children are lu&s;ty.</P>
<P>The chief Commodity of the Coun|try,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Traffick.</NOTE>
is Sugar and <HI>Rocou,</HI> but they make
no great Quantity, becau&s;e the Inhabi|tants
want Slaves to work for them,
and that is the Rea&s;on that Ships wait
&s;ometimes for near a Year's time for
their lading: Tho&s;e Negro's which we
had &s;ent thither by the Ship called the
<HI>Fertill,</HI> were almo&s;t all dead before they
got to the Place; for being taken with
a Calm, they wanted both Water and
Victuals: But we having &s;till about
forty on board, we &s;old them for five
hundred Livres a Man. The Commo|dities
they have from <HI>France,</HI> are Wine,
Brandy, Meal, and powdered Meats;
for Beefs are very rare to be found
there, be&s;ides they are not allowed to
<PB N="127" REF="86">
kill any of them without Leave, as be|ing
de&s;irous to let them multiply.</P>
<P>They carry Iron Tools, and &s;mall
Wares al&s;o thither, for to traffick with
the <HI>Indians:</HI> Four or five Years &s;ince,
Money was very &s;carce among&s;t them;
but the Free-booters who returned from
the Southern-Seas, and the meane&s;t of
which had at lea&s;t two or three thou|&s;and
Crowns for his Share, bought
them Habitations here, increa&s;ed the
Colony, and thereby made Money cur|rent
among&s;t them. They drive a con|&s;iderable
Trade in Slaves, dry'd Fi&s;h,
and <HI>Amacks,</HI> with the <HI>Indians</HI> living upon
the River of the <HI>Amazons,</HI> and by this
Commerce the Colony is very much
enriched; but the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> who for
&s;ome Years pa&s;t have a mind to &s;ettle
there, have ma&s;&s;acred in a mo&s;t cruel
manner tho&s;e Per&s;ons who before went
thither unmole&s;ted, and in all manner
of Security. Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Feroles</HI> hath
begun a Road which is to go by Land
to this River,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Road from <HI>Ca|yenne</HI> to the River of <HI>Ama|zons.</HI></NOTE> and pretends he'll drive

The Earth, be&s;ides Sugar and <HI>Rocou;</HI>

<HI>Ca&s;&s;ia, Papaye, Acajou-Apples,</HI> the <HI>Vanilla,
Peet,</HI> and &s;everal others. As for the
<HI>Papaye,</HI> it's a thick Fruit, and ta&s;tes &s;ome|what
like a Cucumber; it grows round
the &s;tem of a tall but tender Tree
that has large Leaves, and cleft as your
Vine Leaves are; the Tree it &s;elf is hol|low,
and grows above fifteen Foot in
one Year's time.</P>
<P>The <HI>Acajou-Apple</HI> is thick, long, and
of a yellow-red; has a &s;harp Ta&s;te,
and is u&s;ually eaten baked. At the
end of this Apple you have a little green
Nut, that ta&s;tes like a Filbert, and in
form re&s;embles a Sheeps-kidney: This
Fruit grows upon a tall and round &s;ort
of a Tree, like unto a Che&s;nut-tree,
who&s;e Leaves are of the &s;ame Form
and Colour, as tho&s;e of the Laurel: The
Wood of it is very fine, and proper to
make Hou&s;hold Furniture of, and <HI>Piro|gues</HI>
of forty and fifty Foot long; if a
Line, or &s;uch a thing, be once &s;potted
with the Juice of this <HI>Acajou-Apple,</HI>
it's impo&s;&s;ible to take away the Stain,
<PB N="129" REF="87">
till the Sea&s;on of the Fruit be entirely
gone.</P>
<P>The <HI>Vanilla</HI> is a Plant that creeps up
along other Trees, in the &s;ame manner as
Ivy does; its Leaves being of a bright
green Colour, thick, long, &s;trait, and
pointed at the ends. About &s;even Years
after it is planted, it begins to hear a
&s;ort of Husks that are full of an oyly
Matter, and Seed that is &s;maller than
that of Poppy, which they make u&s;e
of in that Country, to give a good
Scent to Tobacco, and Liquors they
have among&s;t them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Peet</HI> is an Herb that can be
peeled in the &s;ame manner, as Hemp
with us, and who&s;e threads are &s;tronger
and finer than Silk, the U&s;e whereof it
would have long &s;ince put out of doors,
if &s;o be it would have been allowed to
be tran&s;ported to <HI>France. Ebony,</HI> of
a different &s;ort, <HI>Letter-wood</HI> (as they
call it) and that of <HI>Violet,</HI> with &s;everal
others, are very common in that Coun|try.
To &s;ay nothing of the Fi&s;h and
Fowl that we find there in great abun|dance,
as we do al&s;o Tygers, Deer,
Pigs, little Porcupines, Camelions,
tho&s;e Bea&s;ts they call <HI>Agontills</HI> and <HI>Sa|paions,</HI>
and divers &s;orts of Animals more.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="88">
As for the <HI>Agontill,</HI> it's a Creature of
the &s;ame Bigne&s;s with an Hare, of a
reddi&s;h Colour like unto a Deer, &s;harp
Muzzle, &s;mall Ears, and &s;hort as well
as very &s;mall Legs; but the <HI>Sapaion</HI> is
a kind of a little Monkey, of a yellow|i&s;h
Colour, having large Eyes, a white
Face and black Chin: It's of a low
Stature, but of a lively and care&s;&s;ing
Nature.</P>
<P>The Camelion doth &s;omewhat re&s;em|ble
tho&s;e &s;mall Lizards that creep up
our Walls, who&s;e Colour cannot be
agreed on, becau&s;e they receive it from
every thing they touch: They have
here al&s;o very large Serpents, but not
very venomous, and &s;ome of them have
been ob&s;erved to have &s;wallowed a
whole Deer at a time.</P>
<P>As for Birds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Birds.</NOTE> they have very curious
Parrots in that Country, that will quick|ly
learn to &s;peak; from which the <HI>In|dians</HI>
pluck Feathers of divers Colours,
by the help of the Blood of certain creep|ing
Animals, with which they rub them.
They have al&s;o other Birds, called <HI>Fla|mands,
Ocos, Toucans,</HI> and many &s;orts
be&s;ides. The fir&s;t whereof, <HI>viz.</HI> the
<HI>Flamands</HI> are Sea-birds, about the Big|ne&s;s
of an Hen, which flie in Bands as
<PB N="131" REF="88">
Ducks, or rather Cranes do; and who&s;e
Feathers being of a &s;carlet Colour, the
<HI>Indians</HI> make unto them&s;elves Crowns
of them: The <HI>Ocos</HI> are as big as the
<HI>Indian</HI> Poultry, black on the Back, but
white brea&s;ted, with a &s;hort yellow
Bill, a fierce Gate, and have &s;mall friz|led
Feathers &s;tanding up like a Cop up|on
their Heads. And for the <HI>Toucan,</HI>
that is a Bird that hath both black, red,
and yellow Feathers, being very near
as big as a Pidgeon, who&s;e Bill is
almo&s;t as thick as his Body, and of a
very &s;ingular make, as being all over
nothing but black and white welts or
&s;treaks, like <HI>Ebony</HI> and <HI>Ivory</HI> interlaid;
neither is his Tongue le&s;s admirable,
being nought but a plain Feather, and
that very &s;treight.</P>
<P>We &s;hall &s;ay nothing of &s;everal Birds,

be&s;ides their Feathers; and therefore,
we &s;hall now proceed to a &s;hort De|&s;cription

One may &s;ee by the Map made of this

to correct, according to the Memoirs
of Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Feroles,</HI> for to &s;end it to

in order to drive them from thence:
This Road begins at the River of <HI>Pei|ra,</HI>
which falls into that of <HI>Paron,</HI> and
by which they can afterwards go down
in Canoes: Here al&s;o Ob&s;ervations may
be made of the different Nations of the

and are almo&s;t always ingaged in
War, which is not u&s;ually put an end

u&s;ually woven after a &s;triped manner,
of divers Colours, and e&s;pecially white,

<P>The&s;e People are very skilful in Bows

work their <HI>Amacks</HI> very curiou&s;ly, and
make very pretty Pots and Baskets,
which they call <HI>Pagara,</HI> and are wrought
in &s;uch a manner, that they go one into

turn their Ornaments, and varni&s;h them
with divers Colours, &s;o as that the Wa|ters

&s;lack, we found our &s;elves &s;till to be at
the &s;ame di&s;tance from Shoar, but a|bout
Noon we gave cha&s;e under <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI>
Colours to a Carvet that came to
di&s;cover what we were, but upon her
putting up <HI>French</HI> Colours, and giving
us a Gun as a Signal that &s;he was
really &s;uch, we hung out ours al&s;o, and
gave her the &s;ame a&s;&s;urance. This was
a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el from <HI>Martinico</HI> called
the <HI>Malovin,</HI> carrying four Guns, and
was manned with five and forty Buc|caneers,
who&s;e Captain came on board
us, and gave us an Account of the
<PB N="139" REF="92">
Death of Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Blenac,</HI> General
of the <HI>American</HI> I&s;lands, adding farther
that he had met with our Fleet, and
that there were &s;ix and twenty Sail
of Ships got into <HI>Barbadoes</HI> about &s;ix
Weeks before.</P>
<P>About five in the Evening we di&s;|covered
three Ships near the Shoar,
which the <HI>Malovin</HI> told us was a Man
of War for a Guard-&s;hip, that carried
four and fifty Guns, and two &s;mall
Frigates of fourteen Guns each, and
that they were come out to hinder
her to take a Merchant Ship, that &s;he
had cha&s;ed to the very mouth of the
Port.</P>
<P>On the 19th by Break of Day we
di&s;covered the &s;aid Guard-&s;hip followed
by a Skiff about two Leagues off of us:
But as there was but very little Wind
&s;tirring, and that &s;he had a great mind
to know what we were, &s;he made u&s;e
of her Oars to get out, and about three
in the Afternoon &s;ent her Shallop to
&s;ee what the <HI>Seditious</HI> was, which was
not above two Cannon-&s;hot off, but a|bout
five &s;he recalled her, and an Hour
after &s;he &s;ailed off and made a &s;how of
getting to the Shoar and recovering
land: But we did not think fit to pur&s;ue
<PB N="140" REF="93">
her, becau&s;e we were apprehen&s;ive &s;he
might return, and had a de&s;ign to
&s;urprize us: But in &s;hort we &s;aw her
again at ten at Night within Cannon-&s;hot
of us, and &s;he followed us all that
Night long almo&s;t within Musket-&s;hot,
and from time to time fired Rockets as
a Signal for the Shallop to come up, that
had not yet rejoyned her. At break of
Day we came up to her with a good
Wind under <HI>French</HI> Colours, and all
our &s;ails loo&s;e, but as &s;he had no other
de&s;ign than to &s;ee what we were, and
not to fight, &s;he gave us no Occa&s;ion
to de&s;ire her to return to Port, which
&s;he did very &s;afely, as did al&s;o the Skiff
and her Shallop, which we di&s;charged
&s;ome &s;hot at.</P>
<P>On the 20th and 21th we bore off to
Sea, and next Day about Noon di&s;cover|ed
a Ship, about three Leagues to
the Windward of us, with which we
came very near up, when the Night
approached and prevented our taking of
her.</P>
<P>On the 24th we took a &s;mall Fly-boat
of forty Tunn,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The taking of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fly-boat.</NOTE> coming from <HI>Virginia,</HI>
laden with Tobacco, Bacon, and Meal

Day gave cha&s;e to another &s;mall Ship,
that made her e&s;cape by the favour of
the Night.</P>
<P>The 25th and 26th we had a great
deal of bad Weather, on the la&s;t of
which, about three in the Afternoon
we &s;aw a large Ship two Leagues to
the Windward of us, towards which
we bare, and all that Night kept a diffe|rent
Cour&s;e that we might not lo&s;e
her, but all in vain.</P>
<P>On the 28th we found our &s;elves in
&s;ight of <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> from which we com|puted
our &s;elves to be five and twenty
Leagues di&s;tance; we were &s;urprized
with our mi&s;take, and could attribute
the cau&s;e of it to nothing but the
Currents; but we took this opportunity
to &s;end our Fly-boat to <HI>Martinico,</HI> to|wards
which &s;he made good &s;ail by the
help of the Night, and a favourable
Wind.</P>
<P>We &s;pent the re&s;t of our time to the
fourth of <HI>November,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Novem. 1696.</NOTE> to get thirty or forty
Leagues out to Sea, becau&s;e the Winds
are always contrary, and that no way
can be made but upon a tack; and on
the &s;ixth, &s;eventh, and eighth we had
very bad weather, and next Day we
were ready to &s;ail back, when we di&s;|covered
<PB N="142" REF="94">
a Ship two Leagues off to the

came within Cannon-&s;hot of her; &s;he put
out <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colours, which we An&s;wered
with ours, and at the &s;ame time gave
her &s;ome cha&s;e Guns; &s;he kept Fight|ing,
Retreating, and wounded three of
the <HI>Sun of Africa</HI>'s Men, which was
ready to give her a whole Broad&s;ide

prevent it, &s;he pre&s;ently &s;truck.</P>
<P>She was a tight Ship, carrying two

and this was her fir&s;t Voyage:
Her lading con&s;i&s;ted chiefly in Materi|als
for Shipping, and &s;ome Cod; we
put twenty Men on board her, and
&s;teered for <HI>Martinico,</HI> but that Night
it blew very hard, and we were &s;epara|ted
from the <HI>Seditious</HI> in the &s;torm;
and on the 11th we had &s;ight of <HI>Barba|does,</HI>
which we left to the North of
us.</P>
<P>Next Day early in the Morning, we
found our &s;elves at two Leagues di&s;tance
from St. <HI>Lucia,</HI> which we had a de&s;ire
to leave behind us, but the Wind
<PB N="143" REF="94">
took us &s;hort: This I&s;land is high of
Scituation, covered all over with
Wood, and very remarkable for two
Peaks in it like a Sugar-loaf, that may
be &s;een at twenty Leagues di&s;tance in
clear Weather: We Coa&s;ted it all Day,
and on the 13th early in the Morning,
we found we were three Leagues from
the <HI>Diamond-Point</HI> of <HI>Martinico;</HI> we
plyed till Evening for to get into the
mouth of <HI>Sack-Royal,</HI> (as they call it)
where we Anchored at five, within
half a League of the Fort, which we
&s;aluted with &s;even Pieces of Cannon,
and were an&s;wered with as many from
thence.</P>
<P>Next Day the Captain of the Fort
entred us for Careening; we found
four or five Ships there from <HI>Rochel</HI>
and <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> and two <HI>Danes</HI> hired by
<HI>French</HI> Merchants for the Voyage, one
of which &s;aluted us with five Guns,

to fetch away their Pri&s;oners,
with a de&s;ign to di&s;cover what &s;tate
we were in, and the <HI>French</HI> Pri&s;oners
&s;he brought over, told us that the
Guard-&s;hip, that had given us Cha&s;e,
when &s;he under&s;tood what we were,
not thinking her &s;elf &s;afe in that Port,
had &s;ailed away for <HI>Antegoe</HI> to joyn
another Ship of &s;ixty Guns that crui&s;ed
about that I&s;land: The Packet-boat went
from <HI>Port Royal</HI> to Fort St. <HI>Peter,</HI> where
all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pri&s;oners that were in
the I&s;land, were delivered up to her,
and &s;ome of whom the very &s;ame
Night, they were to &s;ail for <HI>Barbadoes,</HI>
took away a &s;mall Privateer that was
ready to put to Sea, and had but one
Man to look after her; whereupon
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Officers were pre&s;ently
&s;eized, and the Packet-boat &s;ent back
to demand Satisfaction for this Sei&s;ure,
which was contrary to the Law of War.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t of <HI>December,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">December 1696.</NOTE> tho' we

&s;ince we have had any account of the

as was done by all the other I&s;lands,
as a place of refuge, and each of them
upon different accounts: They lived
there a long time at Peace with the
<HI>Indians,</HI> who gave them a &s;hare of the
<HI>Ca&s;&s;ave</HI> and Fruits that they Cul|tivated;

in the Year 1625, tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> be|ing
put in the head by their Wizards,
that the&s;e new Gue&s;ts came with an
Intention to de&s;troy them, and to take
away their Country, they re&s;olved to
Ma&s;&s;acre them; but the <HI>French</HI> di&s;co|vering
the de&s;ign, took all the Caution
imaginable to prevent it.</P>
<P>In 1626 there was a Company erect|ed
for the <HI>American</HI> I&s;lands, and then they
began to be Peopled, and Ships fre|quently
&s;ailed thither, to Trade for
Sugar, for which they paid ready
Money; but after divers petty Wars,
there was a general Peace made with
the <HI>Indians</HI> in 1660, and they had
St. <HI>Vincent</HI> and <HI>Domingo</HI> a&s;&s;igned them
to retire to. They continue there to
this Day, and come con&s;tantly to
Trade with our <HI>French-men,</HI> between
<PB N="147" REF="96">
whom and them there is &s;o great an
unity, that when they catch the <HI>Eng|li&s;h,</HI>

make &s;mall Voyages into their I&s;lands,
to In&s;truct them in the Principles of
Religion; which they hear with a

thereby, as being &s;till very tena|cious

<P>The <HI>American</HI> I&s;lands Company were
of no longer Duration than the Year
1651, when they &s;old them to the

bottom whereof &s;tands a pretty Town,
containing near three hundred Inha|bitants,
where the General re&s;ides, and
the Courts of Ju&s;tice are kept: The
Streets of it are &s;traight, the Hou&s;es
regular, and mo&s;tly built of Wood;
and here the <HI>Capuchins</HI> have a very
fine Convent. The Fort which is ve|ry
advantageou&s;ly &s;cituated, is built up|on
a large and long Point of land that
runs out into the Sea, and makes
the be&s;t Careening place in all the
I&s;lands: The Fort is no other way
acce&s;&s;ible to the Sea-ward, but by
Layes or Banks of Rocks which do
encompa&s;s it; and the Town cannot
be otherwi&s;e approached to, than by

is flanked with an half Moon, and
two Ba&s;tions, lined with good Stone|work;

it's no more than one Street, a
good quarter of a League in length, full
of a&s;cents and de&s;cents, and in &s;everal
Places interrupted with diver&s;e curious
Rows of <HI>Orange</HI> Trees; to &s;ay nothing
of a River that runs cro&s;s the middle
thereof, that has excellent Water; this
River comes down from a great Val|ley,
that &s;tands behind the Town, and
where may be &s;een a great many
Sugar Plantations, that are very agree|able
to the Eye: At one end of the
Town &s;tands the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> Hou&s;e, which
is curiou&s;ly Built; and at the other the
<HI>Jacobins</HI> Church; where al&s;o there is a
&s;mall Convent of <HI>&V;r&s;ulines</HI> in the mid|dle,
be&s;ides an Ho&s;pital, over which
the Brethren of <HI>Charity</HI> (as they are
called) have the &s;uper-intendency:
<PB N="150" REF="98">
Mo&s;t of the Hou&s;es there are built of
Wood, but very well, and the Inha|bitants
are very Civil and Affable.
<HI>France</HI> may be known there by the
neatne&s;s of the People, and <HI>Martinico</HI>
can boa&s;t that her Females are as hand|&s;ome
as the Women of <HI>Europe:</HI> There
had been a Fort at the mouth of the
River, which the Hurricans entirely
ruined and levelled to the Ground;
they have no more now there, than
two Companies of Foot, and two Bat|teries
at both ends of the Town, con&s;i&s;ting
of eight or ten Pieces of Cannon each;
but they are continually at Work there
to rai&s;e new Fortifications.</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> came thither in 1693,
with &s;ixty Sail of Ships, and made
a de&s;cent above the Town towards the
<HI>Preacher's Point,</HI> from whence they
were vigorou&s;ly repul&s;ed by the Inha|bitants,
who killed about fifteen Hun|dred
of them upon the &s;pot, with the
di&s;advantage of no more than twenty
Killed and Wounded on their own &s;ide;
and Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Blenac</HI> &s;ignalized him|&s;elf
very much upon this Occa&s;ion: He
Marched in one Night from <HI>Fort Royal</HI>
with two hundred Men thither, and
&s;o incouraged the Inhabitants, that it
<PB N="151" REF="98">
may be &s;aid, it was almo&s;t to him
alone that the Succe&s;s of this Expedi|tion
was owing.</P>
<P><HI>Cul-de &s;ac de la Trinity,</HI> that &s;tands
on the other &s;ide of the I&s;land, is much
&s;maller, and le&s;s frequented than the
other Ports; be&s;ides which, there are
divers &s;mall Places on the Sea-&s;ide,
where Barks and Canoes take in
their Lading; &s;o that &s;ince the taking

withdrew into other I&s;lands, they rec|kon
<HI>Martinico</HI> to have three thou&s;and
Men bearing Arms, and above fifteen
thou&s;and Negro-Slaves.</P>
<P>This I&s;land, as has been already no|ted,
is very high and &s;o full of Mountains,
that the middle part thereof cannot be in|habited;
but it's very fruitful in Sugars,
where they are now refined, in Cotton,
<HI>Rocou,</HI> Cinnamon, <HI>Cocoe,</HI> of which they
make Chocolate, in Magniot, and the
Fruits of the Country, which I have
de&s;crib'd already. They have very fine
&s;ort of Wood there, e&s;pecially that
which they call the <HI>Gayac,</HI> of which
they make Pullies, and &s;uch like things,
for the King's Men of War.</P>
<P>The&s;e, and &s;everal other Fruits, which
are tran&s;ported thence into <HI>France</HI> grow
<PB N="152" REF="99">
in this Country mighty well; and Sheep,
Oxen, and Hor&s;es, multiply among&s;t
them apace; and the Ships that &s;ail
thither, whether &s;ingly, or in company,
to lade Sugar, carry with them Wines,
Corn, Salt-meats, and all &s;orts of Mer|chandizes
they may have occa&s;ion for;
&s;o that a Man of an E&s;tate can live
there, as well as in <HI>France:</HI> But yet the
high Scituation of the Country makes
the Air unwhol&s;ome, and there are but
a few Ships that go thither, who&s;e
Crew does not feel the Effects of it;
and we our &s;elves, lo&s;t about a dozen
or fifteen Men, who died as it were
from one Day to another, without any
Symptom of being &s;ick. The Inhabi|tants,
be&s;ides the Inconveniency of a
bad Air, are much incommoded with
Ants, <HI>Mou&s;ticks,</HI> and a kind of an Hand|worm,
which they call <HI>Chiques,</HI> and
which fix them&s;elves in the &s;oles of the
Feet, and are &s;o much the more trou|ble&s;ome
and in&s;upportable, in that they
cannot be rooted out from thence, if
they have once time given them to
lay their Eggs there: Serpents are al&s;o
very common in this I&s;land, and creep

very Leaf of it makes an Ulcer upon
the place it toucheth, the Dew that
falls from them takes away the Skin,
and the very Shadow of this Tree
makes a Man &s;well to that degree,
that it will infallibly kill him without
&s;peedy help.</P>
<P>On the 15th, in the Afternoon, we
weigh'd Anchor, and kept pretty near
the Shoar, that we might be able to get
to the Coa&s;t of St. <HI>Vincent,</HI> within two
Leagues of which we found our &s;elves
next Morning by break of Day: But
it was three in the Afternoon before we
could draw near, tho' we had a &s;mall
Gale that was favourable enough; and
this made us &s;uppo&s;e that the Currents
were again&s;t us; but it blowing at
length, at three of the Clock, a fre&s;h
Gale, we made a little more &s;ail, and
coa&s;ted within half a League of the
I&s;land, where we &s;aw a very fine Coun|try,
and &s;eemingly well cultivated:
The &s;ame is inhabited, on the Coa&s;t by
which we pa&s;&s;ed, with twelve or fif|teen
<PB N="155" REF="100">
hundred Negro's, that fled thither
from the Neighbouring I&s;lands, and
e&s;pecially from <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> from whence
they made their E&s;capes, with a favou|rable
Wind, in their Ma&s;ters Canoes:
But the other &s;ide is Peopled with
two or three thou&s;and <HI>Indians,</HI> who have
a great Trade with tho&s;e that dwell
upon the River <HI>Orenoquo</HI> that is on the
Continent, whither they pa&s;s in their
<HI>Pirogues,</HI> as they do to all the I&s;lands
&s;cituate in the Gulph of <HI>Mexico;</HI> and
that which is very wonderful, is, That
they are never overtaken with bad
Weather, but that on the contrary, they
are always aware of the Day wherein
an Hurricane happens, a long time be|fore
the &s;ame doth come to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Vincent</HI> is al&s;o high of Scituation,
abounding in Fruits, Fowl, in Goats
and Hogs. There is a very fine Port
there to Lee-ward, which the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI>
&s;ome Years &s;ince, would have
made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of; but the
<HI>Indians</HI> prevented their making a De|&s;cent,
with Showers of poi&s;on'd Ar|rows,
and the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Ne|gro's,
who took Vengeance on them
for all the ill U&s;age they had met with
at the hands of that Nation.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="101">
On the 17th we doubled that Place
they call the <HI>Pomgranates,</HI> and next Day
&s;aw the I&s;land of <HI>Tabago,</HI> which the
Mare&s;chal <HI>d' E&s;tre</HI> took from the <HI>Dutch</HI>
in 1678. after two of the &s;harpe&s;t En|gagements
that have been heard of;
but this I&s;land is now de&s;olate, and
&s;erves only for a place of Retreat to
Birds. About Noon we &s;teered towards
<HI>Barbadoes,</HI> which we di&s;covered on the
one and twentieth; and having a fair
Wind on the 25th and 26th, we made
much of our way towards <HI>Barbadoes.</HI></P>
<P>On the 31th we di&s;covered, by break
of Day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prize.</NOTE> a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el to Leeward,
and made all the Sail we could to come
up with her; and as &s;he &s;aw we were got
near her, and that it was to no purpo&s;e
to flee, &s;he came to, and &s;taid for us:
She was a Ve&s;&s;el of forty Tuns, that
had been three Months &s;ailing from
<HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> for the <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and was laden
with Beer, Syder, Herrings, Chee&s;e,
Butter, Hats, and &s;everal &s;orts of other
Goods, being valued at 20000 Livres.
We put eight Men on board her, and
&s;ent her away for <HI>Martinico.</HI></P>
<P>Next Day, which was the fir&s;t of
<HI>January,</HI> 1697.<NOTE PLACE="marg">January, 1697.</NOTE> we di&s;covered al&s;o ano|ther
Ve&s;&s;el, four Leagues to Wind|ward

of us, and we bore up towards
her till three in the Afternoon, but could
not come up with her, which made us
give o'er the Cha&s;e.</P>
<P>On the 6th we had a &s;ight of <HI>Bar|badoes.</HI>
As Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Gennes,</HI> who had
been &s;ick for fifteen Days, found him&s;elf
now &s;icker than ordinary, he thought
fit to return to <HI>Martinico.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">They return to <HI>Marti|nico.</HI></NOTE> We left the
<HI>Sun of Africa</HI> behind us, to crui&s;e, which
&s;he did for five or &s;ix Days, without
purcha&s;e; and we making all the Sail
we could, next Day about four in the
Evening di&s;covered the Coa&s;t of
St. <HI>Lucia,</HI> which we left to Lee|ward
of us; and on the 8th, about ten
in the Morning, entred the Port they
call <HI>Cul-de-Sac Royal:</HI> We were come
very near the Fort, and ready to ca&s;t
Anchor, when we met with a great
Rock, that took out three of our Ship's
outer Planks, without doing us any fur|ther
Damage; we quickly brought her
back, and anchored a good Cannon|&s;hot
from the Shoar; and indeed it's
dangerous to get nearer, and we had
good luck to come off &s;o well.</P>
<P>We di&s;charged our Prizes, and &s;old
the Goods very well, becau&s;e the Inha|bitants,
who were in daily Expectation
<PB N="158" REF="102">
of the Arrival of Mon&s;ieur <HI>d' Ambli|mont</HI>'s
Fleet, wanted Provi&s;ions; and it's
certain they had not twenty Barrels of
Meal left in the whole I&s;land. The
Free-booters had contributed very much
to &s;ub&s;i&s;t them for the fir&s;t Years of the
War, by the many Prizes they had ta|ken
on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> St. <HI>Chri|&s;topher,</HI>
and the other I&s;lands belonging
to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> but now their Merchant-&s;hips
&s;ailed together in Fleets; and there
are al&s;o &s;ome of them, who to avoid
the Privateers, go to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Ta|bago</HI>
and <HI>la Trinity,</HI> and come back
again to recover <HI>Barbadoes.</HI></P>
<P>On the 24th we made ready to &s;ail
for the Fort of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> where we
anchored on the 25th, and continued
in that place till the fourth of the next
Month, to take in Sugar, <HI>Ca&s;&s;ia,</HI> and
<HI>Cocoe,</HI> with which <HI>Martinico</HI> almo&s;t
&s;upplies all <HI>France:</HI> The <HI>Ca&s;&s;ia</HI> grows
in Husks about half a Foot long, upon
a Tree much like unto our Walnut-tree.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cocoe</HI> grows no where but in
moi&s;t Places,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cocoe.</NOTE> and &s;uch as are but little
expo&s;ed to the Sun; the Tree that
produces it is but &s;mall, the Fruit is
long and uneven, like a Cucumber;
<PB N="159" REF="102">
when it is ripe they gather it, and
leave it for a time to dry in the Sun;
it's properly nothing el&s;e but a rind,
like that of the <HI>Pomgranate,</HI> that con|tains
about five and twenty, or thir|ty
Beans, of which thy make Choco|late.</P>
<P>On the 31&s;t. we fitted out a <HI>Bri|gantine,</HI>
to &s;ail to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> to ex|change
the Pri&s;oners they had made
of the Crew of a &s;mall Free-booter,
that had been taken in &s;ight of <HI>Guada|lupa.</HI></P>
<P>I have a mind, before we go from
hence, to relate the Adventure of our
Poor <HI>Mango,</HI> who gave us continually
&s;ome diver&s;ion or other; this was an
old Monkey we had, belonging once
to the Governour of <HI>Gambie;</HI> who was
&s;o prodigiou&s;ly &s;trong, that he broke his
Chain at lea&s;t once in eight Hours; and
as &s;oon as he got loo&s;e, he failed not to
make a Ravage: His main Care was
to get him a Dinner, and when he had
fooled any poor Seaman out of his Me&s;s,
it was very plea&s;ant to &s;ee him get
up to the top of the Ma&s;ts, and to
jump from one Sail unto another with
a di&s;h of Rice, or a great Piece of
Bacon in his Paws. If any one was
<PB N="160" REF="103">
&s;o bold as to go about to take away
his prey, he threw a Cannon-ball at
his Head, or what ever el&s;e came
in his way; all which was nothing in
compari&s;on of the Wounds of his
Teeth, which made &s;uch an Impre&s;&s;ion,
that the Marks of them &s;ome times
remained for the &s;pace of two Months
and upwards. At la&s;t he took upon
him to throw into the Sea the Wheels
of an Ivory-Clock which Mon&s;ieur
<HI>de Gennes</HI> had ordered to be made, and
took up two Years time in the do|ing:
But this was no &s;ooner known,
than that the poor Devil was condem|ned
to have his head chopped off, and
therefore he was carryed a Shoar to
have the Sentence Executed upon him;
but he managed his part &s;o well, that
after two or three Pi&s;tols &s;hot at him,
he broke his Cord and took to his
feet; and all that Day we &s;aw the
poor Animal, as wounded as he was,
run up and down along the Shoar, to
&s;eek out an opportunity to return on
Board; and if he was much concerned
for lo&s;ing of us, we were no le&s;s to
find our &s;elves deprived of his dear
Company.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="103">
From the fourth at Night to the
fifth of <HI>February,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">February, 1697.</NOTE> we made ready to
&s;ail for <HI>Guadalupa.</HI> As for our Great
Prize which remained at Fort <HI>Royal,</HI>
to di&s;po&s;e of her Wood, and relade
with Sugar, we left twenty Men on
board of her; but for the other two
Prizes, we &s;old them, tho' to no great
advantage, becau&s;e they were but
&s;mall, and the Lading incon&s;idera|ble.</P>
<P>At the <HI>Preacher</HI>'s <HI>Point</HI> we met an
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prize, taken by the Merchant-&s;hip,
that entred at the &s;ame time
with us into <HI>Cayenne,</HI> near St. <HI>Chri&s;to|phers;</HI>
then we Coa&s;ted St. <HI>Domingo,</HI> and
on the &s;ixth anchored very near the
Shoar before <HI>Guadalupa,</HI> even in the
mid&s;t of the Town, to the South-we&s;t
of the I&s;land, at the bottom of a very
high Sulphurous Cavity, that ca&s;ts out
&s;moke continually, and oftentimes fire.
We got our full Cargoe in le&s;s than
two Days, and the Inhabitants came
to intreat us with great earne&s;tne&s;s to
take off their Goods, &s;o that we could
have laden fifteen Ships in fifteen
Days time.</P>
<P>This I&s;land is very large, and heal|thier
than <HI>Martinico,</HI> being divided in|to
<PB N="162" REF="104">
two parts by an Arm of the Sea,
called the <HI>Salt-River,</HI> by which Barks
may pa&s;s up when the Tide is in; the
Land is high, but fruitful in Sugar,
Indico, and Cotton: Here al&s;o they
have <HI>Rocou, Ca&s;&s;ia, Cocoe,</HI> and very good
Comfits. Fruits and Fowl are very
common there; and they have a &s;ort
of Birds about the forementioned &s;ul|phurous
Cavity, which they call <HI>Dia|bolins,</HI>
which are very large, and as
good as Pullets; they live upon nothing
el&s;e but Fi&s;h, which they vomit up to
feed their Young withal, and the In|habitants
&s;end out their Negro's to
take them; but whether it be that they
are not u&s;ed to it, or that the Cold,
or the Air of the &s;aid &s;ulphurous Ca|vity
&s;eizes upon them, they are taken
with &s;uch a langui&s;hment upon it, that
they cannot &s;urmount without much
Difficulty; they al&s;o find &s;everal boyl|ing
Fountains in this I&s;land.</P>
<P>That part of the I&s;land which &s;tands
to the Northward, becau&s;e of its being
larger than the other, is called <HI>The
Great Land,</HI> and hath been inhabited a
long time, but at pre&s;ent has not above
an hundred Inhabitants. The other,
which is known by the Name of <HI>Gua|dalupa,</HI>
<PB N="163" REF="104">
has two Companies of Foot in it,
about a thou&s;and Inhabitants fit to bear
Arms, and a great Number of Negro-Slaves:
The <HI>Je&s;uits, Jacobins, Capu|chins</HI>
and <HI>Carmelites,</HI> have their Pari&s;hes
there in di&s;tinct Places, as well as in
<HI>Mary-Galand,</HI> and the I&s;land called
<HI>Saints.</HI></P>
<P>The Town where we ca&s;t Anchor,
is the mo&s;t con&s;iderable and almo&s;t the
only one of the I&s;land, being divided into
two parts by a &s;mall River, which runs
from behind the &s;ulphurous Cavity
we have already mentioned; it's large
enough, and the greate&s;t part of the
Hou&s;es in it are built of Stone: There
is a Battery of eight pieces of Cannon
erected in the middle, and the &s;ame
commands all the Road; and at the
end thereof, upon the Bank of a &s;wift
Torrent, &s;tands a little Fort defended
by eight pieces of Cannon, and lined
with good Stone-Work.</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> made a De&s;cent upon
this Place in 1691, burnt the Town,
took away the Battery that &s;tood in
the middle of it; and there was none
but this Fort made good by the Inha|bitants,
till Mon&s;ieur <HI>d' &V;ragny,</HI> then
General of the I&s;lands, came with three
<PB N="164" REF="105">
or four Men of War, and &s;ome Mer|chant
Ships, fitted up in ha&s;te to rai&s;e
the Siege; when the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> re-imbarked
with Precipitation; and left above two
hundred Men in the Woods, to the
Mercy of the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>Between the tenth at Night, and the
eleventh, we weighed Anchor, and at
break of Day &s;aw a <HI>Brigantine,</HI> that
bore up towards us, when we on our
part did the &s;ame in re&s;pect to her;
upon which about Noon we fired
three Pieces of Cannon, which made
her pre&s;ently alter her Cour&s;e; it is like|ly
&s;he might be &s;ome &s;mall <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Privateer, that look'd after &s;ome Prey
on the&s;e Coa&s;ts.</P>
<P>On the 12th and 13th we were ve|ry
much becalmed,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>St.</HI> Cro&s;s.</NOTE> and on the 15th
we di&s;covered the I&s;land of St. <HI>Cro&s;s,</HI>
which many of our Crew were con|fident,
to be the I&s;lands called the
<HI>Virgins;</HI> for indeed at a di&s;tance it
appeared to be no other than a Num|ber
of little I&s;lands &s;eparated from one
another: Here they have Sugar, Cot|ton,
and Indico, great plenty of Fowl
and Swine. And Cows and Hor&s;es
would have multiplied here apace:
But as they were from Day to Day appre|hen&s;ive
<PB N="165" REF="105">
of the lo&s;s of this I&s;land, they
cau&s;ed the Inhabitants to withdraw
to St. <HI>Domingo,</HI> with all their Effects,
and entirely to abandon the Place.</P>
<P>On the 16th by break of Day we
di&s;covered St. <HI>Thomas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>St.</HI> Tho|mas.</NOTE> that is to Lee|ward
of all the I&s;les of the <HI>Virgins:</HI>
It's very remarkable for many Banks,
and white Towers that do &s;urround the
Port of it: Upon our approach we di&s;|covered
the Town, and a great For|tre&s;s
of Stone-work that defends the
Entrance of it, without which rode
three large Ships. This I&s;land belong|ed
to the <HI>Danes;</HI> the <HI>Hamburghers</HI> have
an Agent there, and the Product of
the Place is Sugar and Indico, but no
very great Quantity of either; and
they would not think it worth their
while to mind it, but that this does
facilitate the Trade they drive in Ne|gro's
with the <HI>Spaniards</HI> of <HI>Portorico,</HI>
that is about fifteen Leagues off.</P>
<P>About Noon we doubled the I&s;land
of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> and left a great white
Rock on the left, that looked at a di|&s;tance,
like a Hoy under-&s;ail: This
<HI>Euripus,</HI> as I may call it, is very com|modious
for the Merchant-&s;hips that
&s;tand in fear of the <HI>Cor&s;airs,</HI> which they
<PB N="166" REF="106">
cannot many times e&s;cape, when they
&s;ail by St. <HI>Chri&s;tophers, Saba,</HI> and others
of the Enemies I&s;lands.</P>
<P>On the &s;eventeenth, eighteenth, nine|teenth
and twentieth, we had a great
deal of Rain and but little Wind; and
on the one and twentieth, we pa&s;t the
Tropick of <HI>Cancer.</HI> From the twenty
third to the twenty eighth we had va|riable
Winds, and very rainy Wea|ther.</P>
<P>The &s;econd and third of <HI>March</HI> we
had great Winds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March, 1697.</NOTE> Rains, and foggy
Weather, and the following Days we
were becalmed: We found our &s;elves
parallel to the <HI>Bermudoes,</HI> but an hun|dred
and fifty Leagues di&s;tance from it,
as being a Place which all the Ships
that come from the I&s;lands, take care
to &s;hun, &s;eeing they have found by
con&s;tant Experience, they mu&s;t meet
with bad Weather there; for the con|trary
Winds either forces them to
draw near it, or to pa&s;s to Lee-ward
of it.</P>
<P>On the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th, we
had a fair Wind and moderate Weather
but from the time of our leaving
St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> till we came parallel with
the <HI>Azores,</HI> we &s;aw Herbs every Day
<PB N="167" REF="106">
floating upon the Sea, which tho&s;e
who had &s;ailed upon the Coa&s;ts of <HI>New
Spain,</HI> told us came from the Channel
of <HI>Bahama,</HI> from whence they were
carried into the main Ocean by the
rapidity of the Currents, and then
di&s;per&s;ed over all this Sea, by the
We&s;terly Winds that continually blow
upon the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>On the 10th we had both Winds
and Rain, and the Weather was very
cold; we came parallel to the <HI>Azores,</HI>
and kept at an hundred and fifty Leagues
di&s;tance from the I&s;le of <HI>Corva.</HI></P>
<P>On the 11th we had very great
Winds, but they blowing of us on|ward
in our way, we were ea&s;ily
brought to acquie&s;ce with them.</P>
<P>Very early on the 12th in the Mor|ning,
the Winds blew very hard, the
Heavens were all over-ca&s;t, and the Sea
grew very boi&s;terous and terrible,
and it was with very great Difficulty
that we could carry low Sails: We
had a Foot of Water in the Hole,
but we could not u&s;e our Pumps;
the Waves were as high as our
Ma&s;ts, and came in upon us on all
&s;ides: And in this dangerous pickle
<PB N="168" REF="107">
we continued all the Day: But about
ten at Night the Winds began to al|lay,
and on the thirteenth we re|joned
the <HI>Sun of Africa,</HI> which the
bad Weather had &s;eparated from us
the Day before, and who&s;e Gallery
had been &s;wept away by a great
Wave.</P>
<P>On the &s;ixteenth, being come paral|lel
to Cape <HI>Fini&s;ter,</HI> we made all the
Sail we could to get a &s;ight of it;
and next Day, at five in the Even|ing,
we &s;aw a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el two Leagues
to Windward of us, and which
we believed was bound for the Bank
of <HI>New-found-Land:</HI> But on this, and
the two &s;ucceeding Days, we had
Hail, Rain, and very cold Winds.</P>
<P>On the nineteenth we di&s;covered a
pretty large Ship three Leagues to
Leeward, whom we cha&s;ed for four
Hours, but could not come up with
her.</P>
<P>And on the twentieth, by break of
Day, we found another within two
Cannon-&s;hot of us, which made us
put out all our Sails, and give her
cha&s;e, which continued for &s;even
hours: But as we had but little
Wind, we could not come up with
<PB N="169" REF="107">
her, and &s;o we re&s;umed our Cour&s;e
again.</P>
<P>From the two and twentieth to the
27th, the Weather was very hazy;
and for &s;ix Days together, we &s;aw
neither Sun, Moon, nor Stars, and had
but very little Wind.</P>
<P>On the 17th we &s;aw three Ships
to Windward of us, which we did
not think convenient to look after,
&s;eeing our Provi&s;ion was now almo&s;t
&s;pent, and that it was our Intere&s;t to
improve our time well; and this &s;ame
Night, we beheld a Rain-bow cro&s;s
the Heavens, which, without recei|ving
any Reflection from the Stars,
that were very much over-ca&s;t, had a
very lively red Colour.</P>
<P>The 28th, 29th, and 30th, we had
favourable Winds, and fine moderate
Weather.</P>
<P>But now the fir&s;t Day of the Month
of <HI>April</HI> being come,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April, 1697.</NOTE> the Wind chopp'd
about all of a &s;udden, and came con|trary;
at what time we accounted our
&s;elves not above fifty Leagues from
Cape <HI>Fini&s;ter:</HI> Next Day the Winds
bare hard upon us, and di&s;abled us to
make the Cape.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="108">
But on the fourth and fifth they
began to allay, and proved fair enough;
and next Day, at &s;even in the Mor|ning,
we di&s;covered about a League
from us to Leeward, a pretty large
Ship, which we cha&s;ed all Night long,
gained much upon her, and had it
not been for a Fog that fell for two
Hours, by favour of which &s;he &s;ail|ed
away, &s;he had certainly given us
either Bullets or Bread, which la&s;t we
now mo&s;t wanted, all our Provi&s;ions
being &s;pent, and the Winds &s;till con|trary.</P>
<P>On the eighth we &s;aw <HI>Pewets,</HI> and
other Sea-birds, who are never &s;een
very far from the Shoar; next
Day being the ninth, we met with a
&s;ort of little Sparrows, who pa&s;&s;ed over
our Sail-yards without re&s;ting them|&s;elves;
and this was an infallible &s;ign
unto us, that we were not far from Land.</P>
<P>On the 12th at break of Day, we
de&s;cry'd two Ships at a League's di|&s;tance
from us, but we could not come
up with them, our Ships being too
foul, too full of Herbs and Shell|work,
to think of gaining upon Ve&s;&s;els
newly careened, as we apprehended
the&s;e to be.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="108">
On the 13th we &s;aw &s;everal Birds
that waited as well as we, for a fa|vourable
Wind to put them a-&s;hoar;
next Day the Wind was boi&s;terous,
and we had much Rain, Hail and melt|ing
Snow: And we lo&s;t Company with
the <HI>Sun of Africa</HI> in a Fog, who not
ob&s;erving the Signal, &s;ailed away,
while we were &s;etting our Round-tops,
that were di&s;placed, in order again.</P>
<P>On the 15th the Wind being &s;ome|what
allay'd, and the Weather clear|ing
up, about break of Day we &s;aw
five Ships, three to the Star-board,
and two to the Lar-board; but we
were not in a Condition to go and
look after any them.</P>
<P>By the &s;ixteenth our Provi&s;ion was
all &s;pent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Men brought to live upon <HI>Chocolate.</HI></NOTE> and we nece&s;&s;itated to u&s;e
the Sugar and <HI>Cocoe</HI> of the Merchants,
to make Chocolate for the Ships Crew;
which is a Liquor that is of a very
nouri&s;hing nature, and might &s;erve
in&s;tead of Victuals; but our Seamen,
who were not accu&s;tomed to it, did
not like it at all, and &s;aid it made their
heads giddy.</P>
<P>On the 17th at Sun ri&s;ing, we thought
we had the &s;ight of the Tower of <HI>Cor|dovan,</HI>
but our joy was &s;hort-lived, and
<PB N="172" REF="109">
this Tower was all of a &s;udden Tran&s;|formed
into a Ship.</P>
<P>At la&s;t on the 18th, after a traver&s;e
of &s;ixty &s;even Days, we &s;ounded and
found a Bottom, and were come
parallel to <HI>Pertuis de Maumu&s;&s;on,</HI> about
twenty Leagues di&s;tance from the
Shoar: On the ninteenth we had but a
&s;mall Wind.</P>
<P>But on the 20th we di&s;covered <HI>Roche|bonne,</HI>
which is fifteen Leagues wide
of <HI>Pertuis d' Antioch;</HI> the Sea, tho' very
even, proved now to be broken and
violent: About Noon we &s;aw four
Ships, and they Steered the &s;ame Cour&s;e
with us. Soon after we di&s;covered the
Steeple of <HI>God</HI>'s-<HI>I&s;land,</HI> about five
in the the Evening, the <HI>Whale-Tower</HI>
in the I&s;le of <HI>Rhee,</HI> and at Night we
came to an Anchor, to wait for the
Tide.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t we weigh'd, and by
break of Day we found our &s;elves
within two Cannon-&s;hot of four Ships,
which we had &s;een the Day before, which
made us put out <HI>French</HI> Colours:
They did the like, and we &s;ent our
<HI>Canoe</HI> on board them, to know what
news from <HI>France:</HI> They happened to
be a Bark of the I&s;le of <HI>Oleron,</HI> and
<PB N="173" REF="109">
three St. <HI>Malo</HI> Men, half men of War,
and half Merchants, who were going
to take in Salt in the I&s;le of <HI>Rhee,</HI> and
from thence to fi&s;h on the bank of
<HI>New-found-Land:</HI> They gave us &s;ix
Baskets of Bread, one Barrel of Ba|con,
and &s;ome Beer, which a little
refre&s;hed our men. The St. <HI>Malo</HI>
men pa&s;&s;ed by <HI>Pertuis Breton,</HI> and we
by that of <HI>Antioch,</HI> and &s;o on till a|bout
Midnight, we ca&s;t Anchor be|fore
<HI>Rochelle,</HI> where we found the
<HI>Sun</HI> of <HI>Africa,</HI> who was got into that
Port two Days before us.</P>
