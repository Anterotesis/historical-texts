<P>NOw <HI>Hind</HI> being in <HI>Holland,</HI> and wanting money, being in a &s;trange Countrey, he had not that command as he had in <HI>England,</HI> and to rob in the high-way as in <HI>England,</HI> hearing of a rich <HI>Mountebank</HI> that went about quacking of it, how he went never without &s;tore of money, his name was <HI>Henrick van Veldes,</HI> he was &s;omething fortunate in Cures, therefore by every one de&s;ired: this Mountebank going to vi&s;it his &s;ick patients in divers parts of the City, having received divers &s;ums of money, for his particular Cures, was watched by this <HI>Hind,</HI> and as he pa&s;&s;ed through by a by-&s;treet, he runs to him as in great ha&s;te, and &s;alutes him in a kind man|ner, thus: Sir, I have heard much of your renown in Cures of dangerous con&s;equence, and &s;ince it is my happyne&s;s to meet with you, I live not far from this place, if you plea&s;e to go along with me to my hou&s;e, I have a wife much troubled with a Flux in her Belly for the&s;e 14. dayes, and you by your experience may do her much good, if you plea&s;e to give her a vi|&s;it; I humbly reque&s;t you to go along with me, and what content you de|&s;ire, I &s;hall willingly &s;atisfie. Well, he goes with <HI>Hind</HI> to his Lodging, and having lockt the door upon him, he takes in one hand a Pi&s;tol, in the other a great empty pur&s;e, and furiou&s;ly looking upon him, he &s;aid, Sir, <HI>here is my wife,</HI> meaning the empty pur&s;e, <HI>&s;he hath been a long time trou|bled with the Flux in her belly, and you are the onely man that can onely remedy and find out a means to cure this Di&s;ea&s;e; el&s;e I my &s;elf, by the help of this pi&s;toll, am re&s;olved to remedy it.</HI> This Mountebank &s;eeing him&s;elf thus cunningly &amp; &s;uddenly &s;urpri&s;ed, began &s;uddenly to cry out, but was pre&s;ently &s;ilenced by the &s;ight of the pi&s;tol, was fain to let go his own pur&s;e to cure that pur&s;e which had the Flux; but according to his wonted charity, &s;eeing the man in
<PB N="8" REF="5"> this trembling condition, he re&s;tored him &s;ome part of his money again, promi&s;ed to convey him to his Lodging, and did with his pi&s;tol cockt, for fear of an out cry, and in the midway left him and his lodging both toge|ther.</P>
