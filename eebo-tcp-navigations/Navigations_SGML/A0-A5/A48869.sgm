<HEAD>A &s;hort Relation Of the RIVER NILE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THe <HI>Aby&s;&s;ine</HI> Emperour (vul|garly, though fal&s;ly called <HI>Presbyter John</HI> of the <HI>Indies</HI>) is Lord of the mo&s;t ancient and large&s;t Dominions of tho&s;e many Kingdoms and Provinces into which <HI>Africa</HI> is divided: This Em|pire,
<PB N="2" REF="5">is the mo&s;t Ea&s;terly part of all <HI>Africa,</HI> called <HI>Ethiopia</HI> above <HI>E|gypt,</HI> not without rea&s;on, all <HI>Egypt</HI> lying below it, and the &s;ame Situ|ation have to it mo&s;t of the bor|dering Kingdoms.</P>
<P>The <HI>Red Sea</HI> bounds it on the Ea&s;t, <HI>Egypt</HI> on the North; On the We&s;t, the <HI>I&s;land</HI> of <HI>Africa,</HI> and on the South, the <HI>Indian-Sea;</HI> with this difference, that Ea&s;tward this Kingdom reacheth the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> though at pre&s;ent the <HI>Turks</HI> cour|taile its greatne&s;&s;e, by keeping the whole Shore of that Sea with two <HI>Forts</HI> in the <HI>I&s;lands</HI> of <HI>Suaguem</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;&s;uba</HI> and one upon the main Land called <HI>Arquico,</HI> which &s;erves for no other u&s;e, than the defence of the Water drunck in the <HI>I&s;land</HI> of <HI>Ma&s;&s;uba,</HI> drawn out of Wells called <HI>Cacimbas</HI> &s;unk near the head of a River, dry in the &s;ummer, full in the Winter, fetch'd daily in Boats called <HI>Geluas.</HI></P>
<PB N="3" REF="5">
<P>The <HI>I&s;land</HI> of <HI>Ma&s;&s;uba</HI> and fort of <HI>Arquico</HI> are too leagues di&s;tant. This, the onely <HI>Port</HI> where is im|ported what <HI>Ethiopia</HI> wants, and whence the natural Commodities are exported, that, in circuit about twelve hundred fathoms; &s;hap'd like a mans foot, hath a conveni|ent Haven, little or no defence, though Gari&s;on'd by near &s;ixty <HI>Turks,</HI> white and black: The Cu&s;tomhou&s;e is inhabited by the <HI>Ba&s;ha's</HI> Lieutenant, (called <HI>Caqua</HI>) and other Officers.</P>
<P>The <HI>I&s;land</HI> of <HI>Suaguem</HI> with the third Fort, is le&s;&s;e, but better de|fended by Art and Nature, incom|pa&s;&s;ed with many Shoals, inhabi|ted by an hundred <HI>Turks;</HI> being the re&s;idence of the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> out of the limits of the Empire, and of natural right belonging to a pow|erfull and warlike King, who&s;e Kingdom is called <HI>Ballow,</HI> (anci|ently <HI>Negran</HI>) the Inhabitants are

<P>Toward the North, between <HI>Egypt</HI> and this Empire lies the fa|mous De&s;art of <HI>Thebaide</HI> &s;o re|nowned for the ancient <HI>Ancorets,</HI> where begins the Kingdom of <HI>Bal|low</HI> above mentioned.</P>
<P>This Empire reacheth We&s;t|ward &s;o far into the main Land that the Kingdom of <HI>Congo</HI> was its tributary, as the great Hi&s;torian <HI>John de Barros,</HI> affirmed in his fir&s;t decade: At pre&s;ent it extends not further than the Kingdom of <HI>Naire</HI> who&s;e Inhabitants are neither <HI>Aby&s;&s;ines</HI> nor <HI>Ethiopians,</HI> yet not de|fective in policy, garbe or govern|ment: The &s;oyle is rich in Gold|mines of the &s;ame quality of tho&s;e of <HI>Sofalla,</HI> lying under the &s;ame parallel and not far di&s;tant, they pay a Tax yearly tribute of their
<PB N="5" REF="6">Gold to the <HI>Aby&s;&s;ine</HI> Emperour, the Coyne called <HI>Miloqueas,</HI> the value ten thou&s;and pieces of Eight.</P>
<P>The Greatne&s;&s;e of this Empire is toward the South more re|&s;train'd, there lying betwixt it and the Sea, divers Nations of Moors and Pagans, barbarous to extremi|ty, which never did, nor do ac|knowledg them&s;elves Va&s;&s;als to the Emperour, who live in tents like the mountanous <HI>Africans.</HI> The chief among&s;t them is elected every Eight year, with the Title of <HI>Caraye Primeyro</HI> afterwards cal|led <HI>Luba.</HI> The Moors bordering on the Sea-coa&s;t have Kings, the greate&s;t of them called <HI>Macheda.</HI></P>
<P>This Empire anciently com|manded many Kingdoms and Provinces, their own Annals and &s;ome Hi&s;torians count above twenty, with almo&s;t as many Pro|vinces: What at pre&s;ent pa&s;&s;eth
<PB N="6" REF="7">for current; is, that its Greatne&s;s was notorious, though now limi|ted to five Kingdoms, each about the bigne&s;s of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and to &s;ix Provinces, every one little diffe|rent from<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Two Provinces in <HI>Portu|gal.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Beyra</HI> or <HI>Alenteyo.</HI></P>
<P>One of the&s;e, and among the bigge&s;t is called <HI>Agaos;</HI> the Inha|bitants of the &s;ame name, whether the&s;e be&s;towed their Name, or took it, from the Province. This is divided into Diver&s;e Territo|ries, the mo&s;t famous called <HI>Tun|cua,</HI> de&s;ervedly glorious in two re|&s;pects, being the Country of the famous <HI>&V;nicorne</HI> (of which I &s;hall &s;peak in this di&s;cour&s;e, and onely now &s;ay tis not the <HI>Abbada</HI> (right|ly taken by Authors for the <HI>Rhino|ceros,</HI>) being in &s;hape, a quite dif|ferent Animal) and having in it the &s;o long &s;ought for Head of <HI>Nile,</HI> concealed &s;o many Age, di&s;|covered by the indu&s;trious Portu|guees.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="7">
<P>The higher part of this Pro|vince is mountanous and woody, yet not without Vallyes and Groves of Cedars, for goodne&s;s and &s;cent, not inferiour to tho&s;e of Mount <HI>Lebanus,</HI> their thickne&s;s is a great inconvenience to Travel|lers, but &s;uites with the inclination of the native <HI>Agoas,</HI> who being profe&s;&s;edly <HI>Pagans</HI> and &s;o of little faith or loyalty, live commonly in Rebellion, thereto invited, not more by their own natural di&s;po|&s;ition than the convenience of certain caves, into which in time of warr they retire, the&s;e Caverns have but one entrance, are capa|ble of one or two families, which are ordinarily great among the <HI>Pagans</HI> increa&s;ed by their wives, multiplied proportionable to the Cows they keep, allowing to ten Cows one woman.</P>
<P>What is mo&s;t admirable in tho&s;e &s;ubterraneous Caves or Ca|verns
<PB N="8" REF="8">is, that they receive not onely their Goods and Cattle (which are their whole E&s;tates, per&s;onal and real, they living little on their crop) but they ordinari|ly find in them water &s;ufficient to &s;erve them the &s;ummer months, when onely they are a&s;&s;aulted, and are without apprehen&s;ions of be|ing conquered, though with &s;moak, by fire made at the mouth of the Cave, having Vents by which they receive &s;ufficient light, and can conveigh the &s;moak, if attempted by fire.</P>
<P>In this Territory of <HI>Toncua</HI> is the known head and &s;our&s;e of the River <HI>Nile,</HI> by the natives called <HI>Abani (i.e.)</HI> the Father of Waters, from the great collection it makes in the Kingdoms and Provinces through which it pa&s;&s;eth; for the greate&s;t part of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> being mountanous, and the Torrents &s;wel'd in the winter, the moun|tains
<PB N="9" REF="8">&s;o tran&s;mit them as to increas the Rivers, which falling into the <HI>Nile,</HI> make no little addition to its greatne&s;s, cau&s;ing it to run with &s;uch a &s;tock of water as overflows the plain of <HI>Egypt:</HI> this is the Ri|ver, the Scripture in, <HI>Gene&s;is.</HI> 2. calleth <HI>Gihon,</HI> which encompa&s;&s;ed the land of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> &s;o doth <HI>Nile,</HI> with its turnings and Meanders.</P>
<P>The Head ri&s;es in the mo&s;t plea|&s;ant Rece&s;&s;e of the Territory, ha|ving two Springs, called <HI>Eyes,</HI> each about the bigne&s;s of a Coach-wheel, di&s;tant twenty paces: The <HI>Pagan</HI> Inhabitants adore as an I|dol, the bigge&s;t, offering to it many Sacrifices of Cows which they kill there, flinging the head into the &s;pring, eat the fle&s;h as holy, lay the bones together in a place de&s;ign|ed for that purpo&s;e, which at pre|&s;ent make a con&s;iderable Hill, and would make it much bigger if carnivorous Bea&s;ts and Birds of

<P>The&s;e two &s;prings ri&s;e in a little field covered over with green and thick wood, Travellers, e&s;pecially Hor&s;emen are ea&s;ily convinc'd that this ground &s;tands in the wa|ter, from the trembling and hol|low &s;ound, this field is lo&s;t in a Lake where 'tis un|der water.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Provincia ubi <HI>Nylus</HI> Oritur Vocatur <HI>Agaos,</HI> Vicina regno <HI>Gojam</HI> Terra vocatur <HI>Sagela,</HI> in apice montis in plano arboribus undiq, circundate. <HI>A|than.</HI> Kercheri <HI>Oed.

<PB N="11" REF="9">of the Neighbouring &s;hrubs, &s;o hinder'd further pa&s;&s;age; the o|ther &s;pring is to be fathom'd at &s;ix|teen Palmes.</P>
<P>From the bigge&s;t &s;pring runs in a &s;treight line a green and plea&s;ant Wood &s;eeming to follow the cour&s;e of the water, which though under ground, leaves the veine to be track'd by its re-appearing at the di&s;tance of little more than an hundred paces, at this appearance the quantity of water is &s;o incon|&s;iderable, as onely to make a very little Rivulet, which grows pre&s;ent|ly bigger, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of o|ther &s;prings bringing in their wa|ter. At little more than three dayes journey from the Head, the River is large, deep enough for Ve&s;&s;els to &s;ail in, and &s;o broad that I doubt whether a &s;trong arm can throw a &s;tone over it.</P>
<P>A little above a hundred paces from this place, this River &s;o con|veys
<PB N="12" REF="10">it &s;elf betwixt rocks, as in the year 1629. I pa&s;&s;ed it without wet|ting my foot; in my journey from the Kingdom of <HI>Gojama</HI> to the Province of <HI>Dambeha</HI> when, the Pa&s;&s;engers being many; and the Boats but few (which I will anon de&s;cribe) I with my companions going along the banks of the Ri|ver, and engaged among many little Rivulets, leaping from &s;tone to &s;tone, got dry to the other &s;ide; the &s;ame did immediately many others, naming it the Pa&s;&s;age of Father <HI>Jeronimo,</HI> I being the fir&s;t who di&s;covered or attempted it.</P>
<P>This is the ordinary pa&s;&s;age o|ver the <HI>Nile</HI> mo&s;t frequented by Travellers, who come from the Court and Province of <HI>Dambeha</HI> for the Kingdom of <HI>Gojama,</HI> the Territory called <HI>Bed,</HI> the pa&s;&s;age over in Boats with head and Sterne, made of gro&s;&s;e and

<P>From this place the <HI>Nile</HI> grows crooked, making almo&s;t a &s;emi|circle: Two dayes journey from this pa&s;&s;age it runs by a point of land into a Lake of fre&s;h water called by the Natives <HI>Dambeha,</HI> abounding with wild-foul, &s;ome

<P>THe <HI>&V;nicorn</HI> is the mo&s;t cele|brated among Bea&s;ts, as a|mong Birds are the <HI>Phaenix,</HI> the <HI>Pellican</HI> and the Bird of <HI>Pa|radice:</HI> with which the world is better acquainted by the fancies of Preachers and Poets, than with their native &s;oyle; little know|ledge is of any of them, for &s;ome of them, nothing but the received report, of their being in nature; it de&s;erves reflection, that the in|du&s;try and indefatigable labour of men in the di&s;covery of things concealed, can yet give no ac|count where the <HI>Phaenix</HI> and Bird
<PB N="29" REF="18">of Paradi&s;e are bred: &s;ome would have <HI>Arabia</HI> the Country of the <HI>Phaenix,</HI> yet are the <HI>Arabians</HI> with|out any knowledge of it, and leave the di&s;covery to the work of time. The Bird of Paradi&s;e is found dead with her Bill fixt in the ground, in an <HI>I&s;land</HI> joyning to the <HI>Mallucco's</HI> not far from <HI>Macaca,</HI> whence it comes thither, unknown, though great diligence hath been imployed in the &s;earch, but without &s;ucce&s;&s;e: One of them dead came to my hands. I have &s;een many, the Tayle is worn by Children for a Pena&s;he, the fea|thers fine and &s;ubtile as a very thin cloud; the body not fle&s;hy, re&s;em|bling that of a Thru&s;h; the many and long feathers (of a pale invivid colour, nearer White than A&s;h-co|lour) which cover it, make it of great beauty. Report &s;aies of the&s;e Birds, that they alwayes fly, from their birth to their death, not di&s;|covered
<PB N="30" REF="19">to have any feet; they live by flyes they catch in the Air, where, their diet being &s;lender, they take &s;ome little repo&s;e, they fly very high, and come falling down with their wings di&s;played; As to their Generation, Nature is &s;aid to have made a hole in the back of the Male, where the fe|male laies her Eges, hatcheth her young and feeds them till able to fly: great trouble and affection of the Parent. This is on the ac|count of the Authors credit which gives the relation; I &s;et down what I have heard. This is cer|tainly the Bird &s;o lively drawn in our Maps.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pellican</HI> hath better credit (called by <HI>Quevedo</HI> the &s;elf dici|plining Bird) and hath been di&s;|covered in the land of <HI>Angola,</HI> where &s;ome were taken; I have &s;een two. Some will have a Scar in the bre&s;t, from a wound of her

That &s;ecret re&s;erved for tho&s;e who travell'd and &s;urvey'd many Countries.</P>
<P>That the <HI>&V;nicorne</HI> is not to be confounded with the <HI>Abada</HI> (com|monly contended for) is certain, from the difference of the names of <HI>Rhinoceros</HI> and <HI>&V;nicorne</HI> not rea|&s;onably to be given to both with|out di&s;tinction, and from the va|riety of their Bodies and parts; as
<PB N="32" REF="20">appears in the <HI>Abada</HI> we know, and in the <HI>&V;nicorne</HI> we &s;ee pain|ted. This has one great &s;traight horne, of admirable virtue, the <HI>Abada</HI> or <HI>Rhinoceros</HI> hath two, a little crooked, not &s;o Soveraigne, though u&s;ed again&s;t poy&s;on. The Country of the <HI>&V;nicorne</HI> (an <HI>Afri|can</HI> creature, onely known there) is the Province of <HI>Agaos</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Damotes;</HI> that it may wander into places more remote is not improbable: This Animal is as large as a hand&s;ome hor&s;e, of a dark brown colour, with the mane and tayle black, both &s;hort and thin (though in other places of the &s;ame Province they have been ob&s;erved with them longer and thicker) with a fair beautifull horne, in the forehead, five palms long, as is painted, the colour in|clining to white: they live in clo&s;e woods and Thickers, &s;ometimes venture into the Champian, not
<PB N="33" REF="20">often &s;een, being timerous, are not many, and tho&s;e concealed in the Woods; The mo&s;t barbarous and &s;alvage people the world hath, enjoy them and probably feed upon them as upon other Bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>A Father, my Companion, who &s;pent &s;ome time in this Province, upon notice that this &s;o famous Animal was there, u&s;ed all po&s;&s;ible diligence to procure one; the Natives brought him a very young Colt, &s;o tender as in few dayes it died. A <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Cap|tain, a per&s;on of years and credit re&s;pected by all his acquaintance, and of great e&s;teem with &s;ome Princes of that Empire, under whom he had &s;erved, gave me this relation of the great ones: He told me, that returning once from the Army (whither he u&s;ually went every Summer with the Em|perour <HI>Malac-Segued</HI>) with twen|ty
<PB N="34" REF="21">other <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> &s;ouldiers in company, they one morning re&s;t|ed in a little valley encompa&s;&s;ed with thick woods, de&s;igning to breakfa&s;t, while their hor&s;es gra|zed on the good gra&s;&s;e which plentifully grew there, &s;carce were they &s;ate down, when from the thicke&s;t part of the wood, lightly &s;prang a perfect hor&s;e of the &s;ame colour, hair and &s;hape before de|&s;cribed; his carrier was &s;o brisk and wanton, that he took no no|tice of tho&s;e new inmates, till in|gaged among&s;t them; then as frighted at what he had &s;een, &s;ud|denly &s;tarted back again, yet left the &s;pectators &s;ufficient time to &s;ee and ob&s;erve at their plea&s;ure. The particular &s;urvey of his parts &s;ei|&s;ed them with delight and Admi|ration, one of his &s;ingularities was, a beautifull &s;treight horne on his forehead, like that above mentio|ned; he appear'd to run about
<PB N="35" REF="21">with Eyes full of fear; our hor&s;es &s;eem'd to allow him for one of the &s;ame brood, curveted and made towards him; the Souldiers ob|&s;erving him in le&s;&s;e than Musket &s;hot, not able to &s;hoot, their mus|kets being unfixt, endeavoured to encompa&s;&s;e him, out of an a&s;&s;u|rance, that that was the famous <HI>&V;nicorne</HI> &s;o often &s;poken of, but he prevented them, for perceiving them, with the &s;ame violent car|rier he recovered the wood, lea|ving the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> &s;atisfied in the truth of &s;uch an Animal, di&s;con|tented at the lo&s;&s;e of their Prize. My knowledge of this Captain, makes the truth with me undoubt|ed.</P>
<P>In another Place of the &s;ame Province, (the mo&s;t remote crag|gy and mountanous part call'd <HI>Nanina</HI>) the &s;ame Bea&s;t hath been often &s;een, grazing among&s;t o|thers of different kinds. This
<PB N="36" REF="22">place is in the furthe&s;t rece&s;&s;e of the Province, therefore the ordi|nary place of bani&s;hment for tho&s;e the Emperour intends to keep &s;ecurely; it ends in high mountains which overlook great and va&s;t Plains, and Forre&s;ts in|habited by &s;everal &s;orts of wild bea&s;ts: To this place of bani&s;h|ment a Tyrannical Emperour, na|med <HI>Adamas-Segued</HI> &s;ent without any cau&s;e divers Portugue&s;es, who from the top of the&s;e mountains, &s;aw the <HI>&V;nicornes</HI> graze in the Plains below, the di&s;tance not greater than allowed them &s;o di|&s;tinct an Ob&s;ervation, as they knew him like a beautifull Gen|net with a fair horne in his fore|head. The&s;e te&s;timonies, parti|cularly that of the good old man <HI>John Gabriel,</HI> with what the Father, my Companion, affirmed of his own knowledge, confirmes me, that this &s;o celebrated <HI>&V;nicorne,</HI> is

<P>THat there was anciently in the Ea&s;t-Indies a pui&s;&s;ant Chri&s;tian Prince, Lord of many Kingdoms and large Territories, is out of que&s;tion: being groun|ded on the authentick authority of good Hi&s;torians and Authors; as undoubted is it, that at pre&s;ent there is no &s;uch Prince; his me|mory peri&s;hed many ages &s;ince, leaving the extent of his Empire undecided. Both the&s;e A&s;&s;erti|ons are proved by the famous Hi|&s;torian <HI>John de Barros</HI> in his Decads. And the advance made by the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> into the <HI>Indies,</HI> a&s;&s;ures us, that at pre&s;ent no &s;uch Prince
<PB N="38" REF="23">is known in tho&s;e many Kingdoms and Provinces of the Ea&s;t, by them di&s;covered.</P>
<P>This being out of controver&s;y, yet the Emperour of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> in the opinion of many, pa&s;&s;eth for that famous <HI>Presbyter John</HI> of the <HI>Indies;</HI> by this name commonly, though fal&s;ly called, by tho&s;e who pretend much, but have little knowledg of him.</P>
<P>There have not been wanting &s;ome late Authors, who upon &s;mall grounds, and le&s;&s;e truth, would maintain this opinion and report, proving by divers Etymo|logies and interpretations of the word, that the <HI>Aby&s;&s;ine</HI> Emperour was properly <HI>Pre&s;ter John:</HI> But this affirmation being without any ap|pearance of truth; excu&s;eth me from &s;hewing how little it hath; I onely &s;ay, that tho&s;e who have &s;pent &s;ome time in <HI>Ethiopia</HI> know all reported on this &s;ubject to be a
<PB N="39" REF="23">meer fable; never any Prince of this Empire had that Title, neither is the word known in the whole extent of tho&s;e Dominions.</P>
<P>That &s;ome Probability &s;pread this report through the world. That this Emperour was the fa|mous <HI>Presbyter John</HI> of the <HI>Indies;</HI> is undeniable: Fir&s;t, his Kingdom being in the Ea&s;tern parts, thence, without Examination, if his Em|pire were properly in the <HI>Indies</HI> (onely lying betwixt the Ri|ver <HI>Indus</HI> and <HI>Ganges</HI>) the opinion fir&s;t &s;ettled on this Ba&s;&s;is. Second|ly, The ancient <HI>Presbyter John</HI> pro|fe&s;&s;ing him&s;elf a Chri&s;tian, having for the Embleme of his faith a Cro&s;&s;e in a hand, and when he went forth or a Journey, a Cro&s;&s;e carried before him, being be&s;ide a Prie&s;t, (all which or the greate&s;t part &s;uites with the <HI>Aby&s;&s;ine</HI> Em|perour, for that he was by ancient cu&s;tome a Prie&s;t, is reported of
<PB N="40" REF="24">him by tradition and their own Annals; for the Cro&s;&s;e in particu|lar, he often carrieth it in his hand, and all there have it in peculiar reverence and devotion) gave ap|parently this Errour a &s;econd ri&s;e. Thirdly, Ignorant, in what part of <HI>India</HI> his Empire was, having often heard of the Chri&s;tianity of this King and his Subjects, and without any records of the ancient <HI>Presby|ter John,</HI> uninqui&s;itive men con|cluded him the <HI>Aby&s;&s;ine</HI> Emper|our: Thus mi&s;takes are common|ly guilded over with the appear|ance of truth. We who lived in <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> reflecting on this, and often di&s;cour&s;ing by way of Inqui|ry, what might mo&s;t probably be|get this opinion, derived it from what I &s;hall here offer; If a thing &s;o ob&s;olete admits any conviction, or what is maintained by common opinion is to be refuted.</P>

<P>This general knowledg pre&s;up|po&s;ed, we come to &s;peak of the Original of the name, for which divers rea&s;ons are given. By my Ob&s;ervations, in &s;ix weeks I was at one time upon that Sea, and twenty dayes at another, when my
<PB N="53" REF="30">Inquiries were very &s;evere and &s;crupulous, I found not any opi|nion warrantably grounded. So general a Name is vainly contend|ed for, and not to be allowed, by certain red &s;pots which appear, and to &s;ome, &s;eem to proceed, from certain parts of a Whale; tho&s;e &s;pots not alwayes appear|ing, and the Whales being very few in tho&s;e &s;hallows; in the O|cean, out of the &s;traight there are many. Neither did I in all my voy|age upon that Sea ob&s;erve any &s;uch di&s;colouring.</P>
<P>A &s;econd Rea&s;on for this Name is fetch'd from &s;ome Hills of red earth, who&s;e du&s;t carried by the fury of the Winds and falling into the waters, changeth it to this co|lour: This opinion &s;eems fabu|lous, for by curious &s;earch, no &s;uch Hills are di&s;coverable, neither could the Du&s;t be &s;o con&s;idera|ble, to make the &s;pots &s;o great, as
<PB N="54" REF="31">would give the General name to the whole Sea. Others contend, that the red Coral which grows in the bottom of this Sea, by reflecti|on on the water begets the &s;ame apparent colour, and gives the name: This Opinion is equally fal&s;e: The Coral at the bottom of the Sea being not red enough to create any &s;uch apparent colour or name; the red is faint, nearer white, than any other colour, enli|vened by an Artificial compo&s;iti|on. Upon the &s;hore of this Sea I have gatheted &s;ome, not in bran|ches but in little pieces, called &s;hop-ware, (being ground and there expo&s;ed) The Sun gave it out of the water a very vivid co|lour; this confirm'd me, that the name proceeded from the Coral.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now declare my opinion, if any voyce be permitted me up|on this Subject. What I &s;hall af|firme, I &s;aw with my Eyes, and
<PB N="55" REF="31">di&s;cours'd the matter with my Companions capable of giving their Judgment. Being Pri&s;oner to the <HI>Turks,</HI> and &s;ayling in tho&s;e Seas, one of my companions and of the Company of Je&s;us hapen|ed to be Patriarch of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> ex|cellently skill'd in Divine and Prophane Learning; We con|cluded the water of that Sea, not different from that of the Ocean; in &s;ome places we ob&s;erved, a long tract of water blui&s;h, cau&s;|ed by the great depth: In others, found divers white &s;pots proceed|ing from the white &s;and, and the &s;hallowne&s;&s;e: Other places were di&s;coloured green, by the mudd which covered the bottom. In o|ther parts of the water, where it was as clear as in any other Sea, were &s;ome reddi&s;h &s;pots; We found the&s;e &s;pots (which were many) to be cau&s;ed by a weed re&s;embling that we cal <HI>Cargaco,</HI>
<PB N="56" REF="32">rooted in the bottom; &s;ome that was loo&s;e and &s;wum almo&s;t on the &s;urface of the water we took up, and ca&s;ting Anchor thereabouts, made an Indian dive to the bot|tom for more. Upon &s;trict ex|amination, it prov'd to be that the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> call <HI>Sufo,</HI> which in great quantity, grows in <HI>India</HI> and di|vers parts of <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> The &s;ame name of <HI>Sufo,</HI> is given to the &s;eed; to a meat made of it, like Almond|milk, well ta&s;ted, (and often eaten by me) and to the Flower, which re&s;embles <HI>Saffron</HI> and may be mi|&s;taken for it. Of this is made a Red-colour call'd <HI>Sufo,</HI> u&s;ed for dying cloath in <HI>Ethiopia</HI> and <HI>India</HI> (&s;ome of which Cloath furni&s;h'd my poor Church in <HI>Ethiopia</HI> with a &s;ure of Hangings) The weed, &s;eed, meat, flower, and colour a|gree in the &s;ame name of <HI>Sufo,</HI> which con&s;idered, put us in mind, that the Scripture, in St. <HI>Jerome's</HI>
<PB N="57" REF="32">Tran&s;lation calls the Red Sea, in &s;tead of <HI>Mare Rubrum, Bahar Suf,</HI> making <HI>Suf</HI> and Red the &s;ame in <HI>Hebrew:</HI> This Sea therefore, being &s;o near rather between <HI>Ethiopia</HI> and <HI>Pale&s;tine,</HI> and in both places <HI>Suf</HI> &s;ignifying Red, our ob&s;ervati|on named the Sea, not from any &s;uch colour appearing in the wa|ter but from the growth of that weed, which in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> and <HI>E|th&igrave;opian</HI> language &s;ignifies <HI>Rubrum.</HI> And by Experiment, the flower boyled, and mixt with juyce of limes, makes &s;o beautifull a Red, that it's nearer an incarnate than Red, and if durable would be de|&s;ervedly of great e&s;teem.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering the weakne&s;&s;e of the other rea&s;ons; from our Di&s;|cour&s;e had on that Sea, we con|cluded the name derived from no other cau&s;e, than from the growth of the weed <HI>Sufo;</HI> in&s;ufficient of it &s;elf to produce that colour, but

<HEAD>A Di&s;cour&s;e of <HI>Palme-trees,</HI> Of their Variety, their Fruit, (and the u&s;efullne&s;se of it,) Of their proper Soyle.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the Trees, created by God Almighty for the orna|ment of the Earth and &s;ervice of Man, the <HI>Palme-tree</HI> is the mo&s;t u&s;efull and profitable to humane &s;ociety: Though for this end the Author of Nature created all Plants, all which, with all their vir|tue are at man's devotion, yet none &s;erves &s;o munificently, and for &s;o many u&s;es as the <HI>Palm-tree.</HI> For from her deepe&s;t roots, which take fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Earth and vegetation, to the highe&s;t leaf of her adorned head, with the va|riety,
<PB N="59" REF="33">propriety, excellency of her fruit, in fine, with all her virtue, is man &s;ub&s;tantially &s;erved, and paid his due tribute; What I &s;hall &s;ay in this Tract will di&s;engage this truth.</P>
<P>The <HI>Palme-tree</HI> is advanced by one peculiar Excellency, by which, without any &s;econd, &s;he hath the advantage of all other Trees, well &s;atisfied in paying man once a year their Tribute, re&s;t from their labour. The <HI>Palme-tree</HI> takes no repo&s;e, but every month in the year pre&s;ents new fruit: A beautifull clu&s;ter of thirty, forty, &s;ometimes more Cocoes, or nuts monthly appearing; and though not above &s;even, twelve at the mo&s;t, come to be ripe and attain the la&s;t perfection, (there not be|ing &s;trength and nouri&s;hment for &s;o many) yet is it que&s;tionle&s;s, that the <HI>Palme-tree</HI> by her fruitfulne&s;&s;e was by God peculiarly created
<PB N="60" REF="34">for the advantage of mankind; If Vigour to perform her natural propen&s;ity be wanting, yet is her generous inclination apparent.</P>
<P>We may truly &s;ay of the <HI>Palme-tree,</HI> that not being, (which is not contended for) that &s;o &s;ingular and excellent tree, peculiar to the happine&s;&s;e of Heaven, which the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Revel. 22. ver&s;. 2.</NOTE> Scripture calls the Tree of life, which beareth twelve manner of fruits, and yieldeth her fruit every month, yet that it is a &s;imilitude or Embleme of that faecundity. That by the frequency and goodne&s;&s;e of her fruit, and by the great be|nefit man enjoys by it, it is a cer|tain Tree of life on Earth, as the other is truly in Heaven, and the mo&s;t beneficial the earth produ|ceth, &s;hall appear in this Di&s;|cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t favourable Climate or Soyle, and which with greate&s;t propriety and in mo&s;t abundance

How re|ligious fables have made <HI>Ganges,</HI> and how vain a &s;anctity, blind I|dolatry attributed to tho&s;e wa|ters, (in which to wa&s;h, is &s;uffici|ent to be clean&s;ed from fault and puni&s;hment, and be &s;ecured of Salvation) much might be &s;aid, by what I have ob&s;erved and heard of this &s;uper&s;tition; but that is not the task of this di&s;cour&s;e, intend|ed onely of <HI>Palme-trees.</HI></P>
<P>The land neare&s;t the Sea &s;ide produceth the faire&s;t; the Air from the Sea, being very favou|rable
<PB N="62" REF="35">and benigne to them. Though &s;trangers give the &s;ame name of <HI>Palm-tree</HI> to divers &s;orts of this tree, all cannot challenge it, neither enjoy the Excellencies, proper to the <HI>Palme-tree</HI> called <HI>Coco:</HI> The Natives di&s;tingui&s;h them by particular names, and reckon up eight &s;orts, all different in their Truncks, leaves, fruit, pro|fit and appearance, yet enjoy the general name of <HI>Palme-trees,</HI> having I know not what likene&s;&s;e, by which they lay claime to it, be|&s;ides the proper name of each &s;pecies.</P>
<P>The chiefe&s;t and mo&s;t famous, and which be&s;t retains the proper|ty of the <HI>Palme-tree,</HI> is that which bears <HI>Coco's;</HI> of the&s;e &s;ome are wilde, &s;ome cultivated, &s;ome, but few, called <HI>Barcas,</HI> which among&s;t them &s;ignifie excellent; and when they knavi&s;hly put off any thing for excellent, they &s;ay 'tis <HI>Barca.</HI>
<PB N="63" REF="35">The Nut <HI>Barca</HI> is &s;avoury, whole|&s;ome, not to be &s;urfeited on, though eaten in never &s;o great a quantity; But as all Trees are not <HI>Barca's,</HI> &s;o not all the Nuts, and the &s;ame Tree bears <HI>Barca's</HI> and others: The Natives di&s;tingui&s;h and very much vallue them.

If the Roots of this Tree touch the Sea or any bracki&s;h wa|ter, the bearing is very much im|proved.</P>
<P>Of the other &s;even &s;orts, &s;ome are e&s;teemed wild, from their fruit, &s;oyle, and the little manuring they require. The Tree called <HI>Cajuri,</HI> is the peculiar one which bears <HI>Dates,</HI> though in <HI>India</HI> this tree yields none, but affords a cer|tain liquor which they di&s;til, and of it make wine.

<PB N="64" REF="36">named <HI>Trefulim,</HI> from her fruit of the &s;ame name <HI>Arequeira</HI> of who&s;e leaves are made great umbrel|las, large enough to &s;helter one or two men from the rigour of the Sun or rain, without which none could travell: There are le&s;&s;e, for the &s;ame u&s;e, like our umbrellas, which al&s;o keep off the raine. This tree yields no fruit.</P>
<P>Another tree there is, (the name not much in u&s;e,) by the leafe, trunck, and make, of the race of <HI>Palme-trees;</HI> the fruit called <HI>de Rapo&s;a (i.e.)</HI> the <HI>Foxes</HI> fruit; eaten, of no good ta&s;te, &s;uch a Crab as ne|ver ripens, and if brought to matu|rity, would prove a wild <HI>Date,</HI> being &s;o in the form, colour, bunch or clu&s;ter.

<PB N="65" REF="36">almighty for his &s;ervice, not of le&s;s e&s;teem and value, becau&s;e &s;ervice|able to divine wor&s;hip, this dedi|cation &s;upplyes the defect of fruit for the &s;ervice of man, and may rea&s;onably rank the tree above the fruitfull.</P>
<P>The la&s;t the Earth produceth, called <HI>Macomeira,</HI> is without doubt a &s;pecies of the <HI>Palme-tree;</HI> her fruit in clu&s;ters of thirty or more, every one as big as an ordi|nary Apple; when ripe, of a Date-colour, and very gratefull, the rind as hard as Tow, oftner &s;uck'd than eaten; if &s;wallowed, of very hard di&s;ge&s;tion; In &s;ent, exceed|ing the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Esteem|ed the best Apple in <HI>Portugal.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Camoe&s;a:</HI> the &s;tone, cal|led <HI>Coquinho,</HI> very hard, though green, is &s;overaign again&s;t many di&s;ea&s;es.</P>

The tree called <HI>Macomeira,</HI> (from the fruit named <HI>Macoma</HI>) is the onely one, that grown to the height of a man, divides her &s;elf into two trunks, each of which at the &s;ame di&s;tance is divided into other two, &s;o grows on, each Trunck producing two, till &s;he arrives to

The &s;econd is, That in the opinion of the Women, (where fancy mo&s;t domineers) the water of <HI>Lanhas</HI> makes a wa&s;h for the face, which eminently betters the Complexion, either by creating it where Nature be&s;tow'd it not, or advancing it where Nature is deficient, or pre&s;erving it where it
<PB N="86" REF="47">was naturally allowed. From what hath been &s;aid, is evidently con|cluded; That if the Author of Na|ture created all Trees for the &s;er|vice of man, the Palmtree of all tho&s;e doth mo&s;t indu&s;truou&s;ly &s;erve and advantage him, by &s;o many wayes, and &s;o con&s;iderable productions; and becau&s;e that which bears <HI>Dates</HI> is of the true Race of Palmtrees, &s;omthing is to be &s;aid of that and her Fruit.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Trees which bear <HI>Dates,</HI> yield them not in <HI>India;</HI> there on|ly affording the <HI>Sura</HI> before men|tioned, of which Wine is made Northward, tho&s;e Trees grow in the greate&s;t quantity; &s;ome have <HI>Dates,</HI> which appear in fair clu&s;ters but come not to maturity: the rea&s;on mu&s;t be in the Climate which favours them not.

<PB N="93" REF="50">without Enemies of that life, which by divers wayes and &s;trata|gems attempt and a&s;&s;ault it: The vegetation of the <HI>Palme-tree</HI> wants not the&s;e, by the <HI>Indians</HI> called &s;ickne&s;&s;es and di&s;ea&s;es, which pre|judice this &s;o adventageous Tree and her fruit, by which Man is &s;o plentifully provided, as he is &s;aid to live and dye, the &s;ame is &s;aid of the Palmetree, which, like man, hath infirmities and di&s;ea&s;es, by which, and many accidents, they pine away, decay, dry up, and at la&s;t dye. There is a long li&s;t of di&s;ea&s;es incident to this Tree, which work her death if Reme|dies are not timely applyed.</P>
<P>A mortall Enemy to this Tree, is a certain &s;pecies of black wormes, which are naturally &s;o provided, as ea&s;ily to pierce any Timber green or dry, thereby conveying them&s;elves into the heart of it, neither doth this con|&s;ume
<PB N="94" REF="51">much time, they de&s;i&s;ting not till they arrive at the inner|mo&s;t &s;ap, living on what they corrode and deface, ca&s;ting out the remainder. This in the <HI>Palme-tree</HI> is effected with more facility and le&s;s time, the wood being tender, and the marrow (the part fed upon) &s;avory: With greater gu&s;to, and by natural in&s;tinct, they get to the top of the Tree; and what they did in the Trunck, do in the Eye of the <HI>Palme-tree,</HI> with more ea&s;e and &s;atisfaction; devouring the Eye, which is Ex|treamly white, tender, &s;weet, de|licious and gratefull, to a miracle. A <HI>Palme-tree</HI> is often cut down, to come at the Eye, as her choyce&s;t fruit and dainty; I have had great experience of its goodne&s;&s;e; the worme hath no ill palate in the choyce of this mor&s;ell; timely re|medy not applyed, the worm leaves not, till, (as they call it) &s;he
<PB N="95" REF="51">procures the death of the poor Tree. To prevent this, the pro|prietor, or tho&s;e called Bandarins, (the onely men charged with the&s;e Trees) are obliged to watch the&s;e thieves; and with Iron In|&s;truments, invented for that pur|po&s;e, (&s;ometimes made &s;treight, when the holes go &s;o, &s;ometimes crooked when they make their way by turnings and meanders) to pur&s;ue them, till they &s;eize them, and upon their forked point draw them out dead.</P>
<P>Another di&s;temper fa&s;tens on the&s;e Trees, through the carele&s;s|ne&s;&s;e or little dexterity of the Bandarins, when they clime the Tree, to empty the Sura, out of the Gorgo or Ve&s;&s;el, into their Gourds; if by chance, any drop lights on the Tree, by a natural malignity, it engenders another worme which attaques and de|vours the Eye. This di&s;a&s;ter is
<PB N="96" REF="52">de&s;perate beyond the help of re|medy, the Ma&s;ter loo&s;eth the Tree, but the Cu&s;tom of the Country, obligeth the Bandarin to make &s;atisfaction: the price of every &s;uch neglect is ten <HI>Pardaos,</HI> in our money, three<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">'twenty five &s;hil|lings.</NOTE> <HI>Mil-Rees:</HI> The great abundance of the&s;e trees in <HI>India,</HI> le&s;&s;ens the mulct; Every <HI>Palme-tree</HI> well manured, and growing in good ground, yields the owner one <HI>Pardao</HI> year|ly. According to this E&s;timate, every Proprietary, gives a near gue&s;&s;e at the Rent of his Or|chard.</P>
<P>A third di&s;ea&s;e &s;eizeth this Tree (her Emolument to man &s;eeming to beget her more Ene|mies to le&s;&s;en her value) which is no open and violent adver&s;ary, but created by the &s;ame Earth, which gives growth and nouri&s;h|ment to the root of the tree, and is no faint re&s;emblance of a
<PB N="97" REF="52">Nur&s;e, who for want of milk, or having it &s;poyled, &s;ees her Nur&s;l|ing pine away, and (without ume|ly prevention) langui&s;h till it dyes. The <HI>Palme-tree</HI> is not &s;e|cure from this danger, the Earth which produceth it, in a long tract of time, or by &s;ome maligne in|fluence, growing barren; this defect is communicated to the Tree, which renders it infirme, vitiated, barren till it fails utterly. This di&s;temper and indi&s;po&s;ition of the Earth, (which the <HI>Palme-tree,</HI> by an attractive virtue &s;ucks in, with the moy&s;ture that nouri&s;h|eth it, and conveyes throughout from root to head) is di&s;covered, by a reddi&s;h minute &s;and, appear|ing in the Earth; The di&s;ea&s;e di|lates not onely in the body, but outwardly on the trunck of the Tree; when the <HI>Bandarin</HI> per|ceives this, he is forced through the &s;ound part of the tree to make
<PB N="98" REF="53">a great hole, to hinder the conta|gious creeping further, as is pra|ctized in Gangrenes, where the &s;ound part is cut off: the parts af|fected without, are unbark'd, and where the &s;and appears they run in hot Irons. The&s;e cures not timely applyed, the profitable tree peri&s;heth.</P>
<P>The&s;e di&s;a&s;ters are accompani|ed with a &s;ecret of Nature, worth reflection. Two or three years before this untimely death, the&s;e Trees are &s;aid to be laden with <HI>Co|co's</HI> or Nuts, &s;o beyond Cu&s;tome, that this unu&s;ual exce&s;&s;e is &s;u&s;pici|ous to the Natives, and awakens them to watch the di&s;ea&s;es inci|dent to the Palmetree, &s;o to hinder them by a timely preven|tion; Nature by this overplus, &s;eems to &s;upply the ab&s;ence and lo&s;&s;e of this Tree; and the be|neficial Palme, fore&s;eeing the End of her munificence, &s;trives
<PB N="99" REF="53">to recompence her Owner.</P>
<P>There is yet in the Palmetree a thing more excellent, delicious, more gratefull to the palate, than hath been mentioned; a Mor&s;ell to be compared with what&s;oever is e&s;teemed mo&s;t delicate, is that they call Palmito, the innermo&s;t Eye of the tree; which being cut out and &s;tript of the boughes, may pa&s;&s;e for the Center of all the branches, which in the heart of the Tree, before they &s;hoot forth are &s;o joyned and united, as to appear the &s;ame thing. The &s;ub&s;tance of this <HI>Palmito</HI> is white like milk, delicious in extreamity, coagulat|ed, tender, of a ta&s;te above milk, more delightfull and of a better Confection; <HI>in fine a Bocone</HI> plea|&s;ing in the highe&s;t, and free from all ful&s;omene&s;&s;e. What I have &s;aid is without exaggeration, the Reader I am &s;ure, would, if he ta&s;ted it, be of my opinion, who
<PB N="100" REF="54">am able to give a &s;ufficient ac|count of this <HI>Palmito,</HI> for be&s;ides my experience of it in <HI>India,</HI> where other provi&s;ion wanted not, at the Cape of good Hope (where the Ve&s;&s;el, we came in for <HI>Portugal,</HI> &s;uffered &s;hipwrack, at the land called <HI>Terra de Natal,</HI> and where we &s;pent eight months on &s;hoar, in the place we were fir&s;t ca&s;t upon, to build two barks to &s;ave our Company) I had lei&s;ure enough to be convinced of its ex|qui&s;itene&s;&s;e, there &s;carcity of pro|vi&s;ion, obliged us to make u&s;e of what we found; 'twas our good fortune to light on great &s;tore of Palmetrees, not of tho&s;e which yield <HI>Coco's</HI> or Nuts, but of that &s;pecies which bear Dates; there, having known in <HI>India</HI> what the <HI>Palmito</HI> was, we in a &s;hort time fur|ni&s;hed our &s;elves with as many as grew in a leagues compa&s;&s;e; the <HI>Palmito</HI> &s;erved us for food and
<PB N="101" REF="54">dainty, neither was its gratefull|ne&s;&s;e hightned by our hunger.</P>
<P>The Fruitfullne&s;&s;e and profit of the Palmetree, la&s;ts many years; there are &s;igns for a near gue&s;&s;e, at her preci&s;e duration. This tree puts forth every year four Branches, which lei&s;urely di&s;|play them&s;elves in the forme of a Cro&s;&s;e, after three or four years decay; which the Palmetree of her &s;elf ca&s;ts off, or they are lopt off by the Bandarins, every one leaves a mark where it grew: By the&s;e is given a probable conje|cture at the age of the tree. That it may appear how the whole Palmetree is &s;erviceable to hu|mane life, nothing &s;uperfluous, but all &s;ub&s;tantially profitable, from the deepe&s;t root to the high|e&s;t leaves: The Root (as hath been &s;aid before, where we &s;poke of the virtue of the other parts) Chark'd, gives an excellent tem|per
<PB N="102" REF="55">to Iron; The boughes and leaves, made up with a wick, &s;erve for a torch, (called by them <HI>Chuli</HI>) with this Travellers are &s;ecure from all danger of Serpents, which abound in <HI>India,</HI> are of ex|qui&s;ite poy&s;on, and their multi|tude makes them frequent the Roads, and a&s;&s;ault Pa&s;&s;engers: They fly from the light of this <HI>Chuli;</HI> of another &s;ervice when they fi&s;h in the Rivers, in &s;tead of a Candle as is u&s;ual in <HI>Portugal:</HI> Of the leaves be&s;ides, are made great Para&s;ols, capable to &s;helter two per&s;ons from the Sun or Rain; the&s;e require a man to carry them (there are per&s;ons deputed for that office) and are called <HI>Boy de Sombrero;</HI> &s;mall portable ones there are for the &s;ame u&s;e, none walking in the &s;treets, winter or &s;ummer without great or little Pa|ra&s;ols. The leaves have another u&s;e; of them are made Cover|ings
<PB N="103" REF="55">for their Palanquins or Lit|ters, in which one per&s;on is com|modiou&s;ly carried and defended from the rain and &s;un. Some Palmetrees afford leaves called <HI>Olhas,</HI> which &s;erve for Books and Paper, with a &s;mall Iron Pencil in &s;tead of a pen, they open and grave the letters, upon the leaf or <HI>Olha,</HI> without the u&s;e of Inke, as fa&s;t and as ea&s;ily, as the &s;wifte&s;t writer. The leafs of the Tree <HI>Cajuri</HI> dried, remain of a lively white colour, which are made in|to hatts, of great account though cheap, being &s;o becoming, &s;o ac|curately wrought and light, that every body the <HI>vice-roy</HI> not ex|cepted, de&s;ires to wear them: the <HI>Indians</HI> call them <HI>Palhate.</HI> The Bark of the <HI>Poyo</HI> or twig on which grow the fair clu&s;ters of <HI>Coc'os,</HI> being of a thicker and &s;tronger &s;ub&s;tance furni&s;h the Common people, particularly the Banderins,
<PB N="104" REF="56">who dre&s;&s;e the Palmetrees with Caps made like the Engli&s;h ordi|nary Riding-caps.</P>
<P>To end the di&s;cour&s;e, I &s;hall ob|&s;erve, (what challenges a reflecti|on) the natural fabrick of the Palmetree; that the trunk being very &s;lender and di&s;proportiona|ble to the tallne&s;&s;e, the whole weight of the boughes, (called Palmes) and of the fruit, being at the top, in a manner at the verti|cal point of the &s;lim body, the boughes, as they grow, di&s;playing them&s;elves, and among&s;t them hanging the fair clu&s;ters of <HI>Coco's,</HI> the &s;hock of winds, &s;hould with|out doubt, ea&s;ily break and ruine this di&s;proportioned Machin. Provident nature, again&s;t this, hath for every new birth of tho&s;e boughes provided &s;wathes, of the &s;ame matter and texture of the Palmetree, not unlike cour&s;e cloath or Canvas: with the&s;e the
<PB N="105" REF="56">branches and what grows there, are &s;wathed &s;o &s;trongly and &s;e|curely as to defy any violence of winds to di&s;joynt them: they are liable to be &s;hak'd, yet not where they have this Girdle, which to break is a work of Iron. By the&s;e the Palmetree, as a tender mother, gathers her Children about her, as &s;ecure from being lo&s;t and &s;cat|tered, as they are well defended again&s;t any violence of wind, which would tear and force them from her bo&s;om.</P>
<P>This is what, for the &s;atisfaction of the Curious, could be known of the Palmetree, of what &s;pecies &s;oever; who de&s;ires a more parti|cular and &s;evere relation, may travell into <HI>India,</HI> and tho&s;e other parts where this Tree grows, may enquire more minutely, and per|haps loo&s;e his labour.</P>
