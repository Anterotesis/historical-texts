<HEAD>An Exact JOURNAL OF THE ENGAGEMENT Between the <HI>Engli&s;h Fleet and the French</HI> From <HI>May</HI> the 18^t^h. to the 25^t^h. 1692.</HEAD>
<P><HI>May</HI> 18. ABOUT nine a Clock this Morn|ing, the Admiral, with the whole Fleet weighed, being all at An|chor off <HI>Dunno&s;e</HI> with the Wind at W. S. W. and S. W. by W. &s;tood over to the French Coa&s;t all night, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 19. This Morning at day-light, the Wind W. S. W. and W. by S. we di&s;|covered the French Fleet a great way to Windward, &s;ignal was made for our draw|ing into the Line of Battel, and about nine a Clock the French began to bear down, <HI>Tourville</HI> him&s;elf, with a great deal of Bravery &s;ingled out our Admiral; and was received with more than equal Cou|rage: At Eleven, the French being got pretty near, <HI>Tourville</HI> him&s;elf being brought to within le&s;s that Mu&s;quet Shot of Ad|miral <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> which was admired in general both by the Engli&s;h and Dutch, that the French Admiral, being &s;o &s;mall a Fleet, &s;hould &s;o Re&s;olutely attack outs, being &s;o much Superior to his in number, for the French Line &s;preading but little farther a Head or a Stern than the Red Squadron, we could not well con&s;true the meaning of their vigorou&s;ly falling upon that Squa|dron, the Dutch and the Blue having little or no &s;hare in the Fight, but in le&s;s than a quarter of an Hours time there was no|thing to be &s;een but a Terrible Smoak and Fire that darkened all the Air, &s;o that none could perceive a Cables length from their Ships, which was accompanied with a continual Thunder of Guns for four Hours, the Firing being &s;mart on both &s;ides, from Eleven till Three; but the French Admiral finding the Engli&s;h too hot for him, and his Main Top Sail Yard being Shot, about Five a clock he got his Main Tack on Board, and it proving little Wind he towed off, and endeavoured to get out of the way and reach of our Mi&s;chievous Engli&s;h Guns: His Example was followed by the re&s;t of the French Fleet, but about Six or Seven of the Clock the Wind &s;hifted to the Ea&s;tward, they fell in among&s;t the Blue, &s;ome of which Squadron, together with Sir <HI>Cloud&s;ley Shovell,</HI> had a very hot di&s;pute with them till near Eleven a Clock, the French fighting their way through, and it being but little Wind, we &s;tood till night after them, and at Ten a Clock at night we &s;aw &s;ome Ships Blown up.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 20. All la&s;t night we continued the Cha&s;e, and the Wind this Morning having &s;hifted to the We&s;tward, the French were again got to the Windward, they Plying and we after them; at Five in the Afternoon they Anchored, and we did the &s;ame, <HI>Cape de Hogue</HI> bearing W. S. W. about &s;even Leagues di&s;tant, and a prodi|gious &s;trong Tide running at Eleven this Night, we weighed and plied to Wind|ward all night.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 21. This Morning part of the French Fleet run in at the Race of <HI>Alderney,</HI> the re&s;t plying to Windward, and Anchored to the We&s;tward of it. Sir <HI>John A&s;hby</HI> and &s;ome of the Engli&s;h Windward, mo&s;t Ships Anchored after the French; Admiral <HI>Ru&s;&s;ell</HI> and the Fleet with him Cut, and followed &s;ome Ships of the French, that drove out of the Race again, their Anchors not being able to bring them up again&s;t &s;o &s;trong a Tide; the Admiral left Sir <HI>Ralph Delavall</HI> with &s;ome Ships, to de&s;troy part of the French Fleet that were run into <HI>Cherburg,</HI> whil&s;t he him&s;elf followed others into <HI>La Hogue.</HI></P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 22. Sir <HI>John A&s;hby,</HI> and the Ships with him, not being able to get up with the Ships he cha&s;ed, only one Fire Ship which was taken ye&s;terday in the Evening, the French having this Morning borne away among the I&s;lands of <HI>Alderney, Jer&s;ey</HI>
<PB REF="2" MS="y">and <HI>Guern&s;ey,</HI> and the Rocks, Sir <HI>John</HI> and the re&s;t bore away to the Admiral and Sir <HI>Ralph,</HI> with the Fire-Ships and Boats with him (having fir&s;t &s;ent a&s;hore a Flag of Truce to give the French warning, to take their Men both Well and Wounded out of their Ships) burnt three of their Ca|pital Ships, one of them the <HI>Soleil Royal,</HI> the French refu&s;ing to take their Men a&s;hore, great part of them were Burnt and Blown up.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 23. This Morning Sir <HI>John A&s;hby,</HI> Sir <HI>Ralph Delaval</HI> and the <HI>Dutch,</HI> Joyned the General and the Ships with him, who Anchored off <HI>La Hogue;</HI> and there all the re&s;t of the <HI>French</HI> Men of War that were drove out of the Race, were clo&s;e into the Shoar, which the Admiral de&s;ign'd to Burn and De&s;troy, having ordered Vice Admiral <HI>Rooke</HI> with a Detachment of &s;ome of the Third and Fourth Rates to go in with &s;ix Fire &s;hips, and all the Pinnaces and Long boats of the Fleet. About Six a Clock they were got into the Shore, and our Ships Fired at their Ships and Forts that were there, but could not get in; &s;o the Boats attempted to tow in the Fire-&s;hips, but finding the bu&s;i|ne&s;s might be done without burning the fire &s;hips, the Boats only went in, and about Nine a Clock &s;et on Fire the fir&s;t Ship, which was by it &s;elf, and &s;et on Fire <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 word"> Five more that Night, which made the mo&s;t extraordinary Bonfire that ever was &s;een, five of them being three Deck'd Ships, and it being in the Night, was &s;een to all the Advantage imaginable, the Smoak and Fire, together with the Guns Firing and Ships Blowing up, being Pro|digious: The Earl of <HI>Danby</HI> &s;ignaliz'd him|&s;elf by going in the Headmo&s;t Boat, and going on Board three of their bigge&s;t Ships and Burning them.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 24. All this day the Boats continu|ed to Burn the <HI>French</HI> Ships in the Shore, and Burn'd Eight Men of War more, of which there were not above four &s;mall Ships of Forty or Fifty Guns, all the re&s;t of a Hundred or Eighty Guns, be&s;ides a great many Merchant Ships and &s;mall Craft, and their Magazine of Powder Blowing up a Shore. There never was &s;o many fine Ships de&s;troyed at one time, nor &s;o terrible a Light for People to be|hold on their own Coa&s;t: And about Twelve a Clock at Noon, the Vice-Ad|miral with all the Ships and Boats came off again into the Fleet, having left all the Enemies Ships on a Flame, and a great Army to be Spectators, there being drawn down about Thirty thou&s;and Men, Commanded by <HI>Belfont,</HI> King <HI>James</HI> be|ing there to &s;ee all the Tran&s;actions.</P>
<P>In all we lo&s;t not one Man of War; &s;ome Fire &s;hips were burn'd without do|ing Execution, &s;ome by Accident; and we cannot find that any Officers are Kill'd be&s;ides Rear-Admiral <HI>Carter</HI> and Colonel <HI>Ha&s;tings,</HI> Captain <HI>Graydon</HI> is &s;aid to be Dead, but of that no Certainty.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> have lo&s;t <HI>Gabaret</HI> their Ad|miral of the <HI>Blew,</HI> Ship and all in the Fight Burn'd, and one Captain <HI>Decombe,</HI> who was Captain of the <HI>Illu&s;trious,</HI> a Ship of Seventy Guns Burnt: <HI>Tourville</HI>'s Nephew is thought to be Killed al&s;o; what Damage they im|mediately received in the Fight, is not as yet known: But upon the whole matter, there never was &s;o great a Victory obtained at Sea in &s;o &s;hort a time, and I hope it is a pre&s;age for a future Succe&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 25. This Morning the Wind at Ea&s;t and by South, and <HI>E. S. E.</HI> the Ad|miral and the Fleet Sailed and Steered a|way <HI>N. E.</HI> by <HI>N.</HI> and <HI>N.</HI> by <HI>E.</HI> for <HI>Eng|land.</HI></P>
