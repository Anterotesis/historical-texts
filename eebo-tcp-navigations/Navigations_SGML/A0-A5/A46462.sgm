<HEAD>REMARQUES, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Pa&s;&s;ions and Affections of &s;ome People are &s;o unaccoun|table, that it puzles Imaginati|on to conceive how &s;trong a Zeal can ari&s;e from &s;o unde&s;erving a Sub|ject of their Veneration. For in&s;tance, not to Treat untenderly with on the Ru|ines of Maje&s;ty, nor take up Royal Mi&s;|carriages, to make Reflections on Great|ne&s;s in Di&s;tre&s;s: The Publication of this following <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion,</HI> of the Late King <HI>James,</HI> is not &s;o much intended, as an In|vective on that unhappy Prince, as to ex|pre&s;s our Admiration at the unfathomable Extravagancies of &s;ome over-bigotted Zealots in his Favour.</P>
<P>We are all &s;en&s;ible that 'tis the common Ambition of degraded Princes, how ju&s;t|ly &s;oever Dethroned, to indeavour their own Re&s;tauration. There is a Chance in a Crown, and 'tis an extraordinary Re&s;ig|nation, that can quit the Pretences to Ti|tles &s;o Great, though never &s;o de&s;erving|ly Forfeited. We do not therefore at all wonder at the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Army, pre|pared for his once intended De&s;cent and Inva&s;ion of <HI>England;</HI> nor the early Naval Preparations of the <HI>French</HI> on that Occa|&s;ion. Such an Expedition on &s;o important an Attempt, carried &s;ome little Face of Glory in it. His very Enemies could not deny but &s;uch an Enterprize had been an
<PB REF="2" MS="y"> Ambition we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 word">; and had he &s;uc|ceeded, he might fairly have written him&s;elf <HI>James</HI> the Conqueror. But Gen|tlemen, as bold and gallant Atchieve|ments, in the Univer&s;al Standard of Ho|nour, carry a great Name; and which true Greatne&s;s, po&s;&s;ibly, has no occa&s;ion to be a&s;hamed of. Neverthele&s;s, there may be tho&s;e poorer De&s;igns, that in&s;tead of being either Great or Glorious, perhaps may carry the vile&s;t and mo&s;t abject Face, that a much le&s;s Character then King <HI>James</HI> ought to blu&s;h at. As for Example, the foregoing <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>There you'l find in&s;tead of a more war|rantable Ambition of recovering Three Kingdoms, he poorly de&s;cends to grant his Commi&s;&s;ions to Privateers to R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">fle and Spoil all the Subjects of <HI>England, Scot|land</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> indifferently to Burn, Sink and Fire their Ve&s;&s;els, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and all this without re&s;pect of Per&s;ons, Intere&s;ts or Religion. The &s;evere&s;t Romani&s;t, or mo&s;t violent Jacobite (without excepti|on) is to he &s;wept in the common Doom. So that in&s;tead of pretending all his for|mer promis'd Impunity and Tenderne&s;s to the People of <HI>England,</HI> or in&s;tead of Bravely grappling at his Royal Rival in the Imperial Seat, he vilely &s;umes little le&s;s than a common Pyrate, Authorizes the Depredations of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants even by the very hands of <HI>Engli&s;hmen.</HI> This la&s;t poor Spirited Meanne&s;s mu&s;t either plainly tell us, that he has utterly renounced all hopes of recovery of his Kingdoms; and &s;o under that De&s;pair he re&s;olves to play at a &s;mall Game rather than &s;tand out, (which indeed is the be&s;t Title I can give it) and con&s;equent|ly (like the Famous <HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> &s;umed Pedagogue) when he can Scourge King|doms no longer, he prepares his le&s;&s;er Rods for a more humble Tyrannick La&s;h; or el&s;e that forgetting that he ever was a Monarch, and therefore blu&s;hing at no|thing though never &s;o Unprincely, he contents him&s;elf with being under Secre|tary to the <HI>French</HI> King, whil&s;t the little <HI>James</HI> is but a Sub&s;cription to the Grea|ter <HI>Lewis.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> King deputes him as his <HI>Emanuen&s;is</HI> to Copy Commi&s;&s;ions for hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">; and the Contented Receiver o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> that high Favour is paid to officiate in the Tru&s;t. It was remarkt of him, that at his fir&s;t departure from <HI>England</HI> upon his Tran&s;port from <HI>Fever&s;ham,</HI> he uttered this Expre&s;&s;ion. <HI>That he had rather be a Captain of a Troop of Light Hor&s;e under the</HI> French <HI>King, than Raign King of</HI> Eng|land <HI>under the La&s;h and Controul of Parlia|ments.</HI> A Captain of a Troop of Hor&s;e is no over-high Po&s;t. But truely of the two 'tis much the more Honourable than the granting of &s;uch Commi&s;&s;ions. But indeed all the&s;e tend to the aggrandizing o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">he <HI>Freech</HI> King; the poorer the Sub|jects of <HI>England,</HI> the &s;tronger the Grand <HI>Lewis;</HI> his inviolable Zeal and Fidelity, therefore to that mo&s;t Chri&s;tian (&s;o titled) <HI>Nero,</HI> &s;upercedes all other Con&s;iderations, and <HI>(fas aut nefas)</HI> right or wrong, ho|nourable or infamous, nothing comes a|mi&s;s that carries the lea&s;t &s;hadow of &s;ervice to that darling Idol.</P>
<P>One thing is very Remarkable in the <HI>Janus</HI> Faces of King <HI>James</HI>'s Prete<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ces. This very Commi&s;&s;ion found on Board one of the late Prizes, was dated at St. <HI>Germans,</HI> the 22d of <HI>February:</HI> which (pray ob&s;erve) bearing date before his intended Inva&s;ion; impours this Privateer to enter into any Port or River of <HI>Eng|land, Scotland,</HI> or <HI>Ireland;</HI> and commit all tho&s;e Ho&s;tilities of Firing, Sinking, Burning, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> All Traders Ve&s;&s;els what|ever; at the &s;ame time that his Declarati|on, prepared for his Reception in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> intimated all the Affection and Ten|derne&s;s imaginable to the Intere&s;ts Pro|perty, and what not, of his Subjects of <HI>England,</HI> viz. That he was coming only to recover his own Right, E&s;tabli&s;h and Re&s;tore their Laws and Liberties; and yet at the &s;ame time he gave out Com|mi&s;&s;ions to Wa&s;te, Ruine, and De&s;troy the mo&s;t innocent Traders of the King|dom, po&s;&s;ibly no ways intere&s;ted in the Titles, and Di&s;putes of Princes, in Par|ties or Cau&s;es; but on the contrary only endeavouring a peaceable Acqui&s;ition of their Dread, by their Hone&s;t Commerce and Indu&s;try.</P>
