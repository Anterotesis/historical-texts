<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>WHEN in the Preface to the Synod of</HI> Diamper, <HI>I promi&s;ed, from</HI> Portu|gue&s;e Relations, <HI>to give &s;ome Ac|count of the Churches which were never within the Bounds of the</HI> Roman Empire; <HI>I intended to have begun with the Church of</HI> Mo&s;ul, <HI>or</HI> Babylon; <HI>but not having hitherto been able to procure tho&s;e Infor|mations of it which I had then &s;ome rea&s;on to ex|pect; and having, during my nine Years Re&s;idence at</HI> Lisbon, <HI>furni&s;hed my &s;elf with all the</HI> Portu|gue&s;e <HI>Books which do any ways treat of</HI> Ethiopia, <HI>I was per&s;waded by &s;ome Friends to alter my mind, and to begin with</HI> That Church, <HI>which of all others, till within the&s;e Two hundred years, had had the lea&s;t Communication with the</HI> Roman; <HI>and which, notwith&s;tanding all the pains its Princes and the Je&s;uits have been at of late, to bring her under the Bondage of the Papacy, has, tho with a terrible &s;truggle, maintained her Primitive Liberty and In|dependency on</HI> that Ambitious <HI>and</HI> U&s;urping See; <HI>and does to this day, with greater Zeal than ever, a&s;&s;ert them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And that I may not &s;eem</HI> Actum agere <HI>in pub|li&s;hing an Hi&s;tory of</HI> Ethiopia <HI>after the Learned Mr.</HI> Ludolphus: <HI>I am to acquaint the Reader, That whereas the two great Splendid</HI> Roman Mi&s;|&s;ions <HI>into that Empire, are the mo&s;t remarkable things that have come to our knowledge in the Hi|&s;tory of that Church; &s;o if &s;ome of my Learned Friends are not mi&s;taken, Tho&s;e Two Mi&s;&s;ions, with
<PB REF="4">all their Steps and Circum&s;tances, are here placed in a truer Light than they were ever &s;een in before.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And tho I will not promi&s;e that my</HI> Conjectures <HI>upon the dark and hidden things of tho&s;e</HI> Mi&s;&s;ions <HI>are all true; as who indeed that makes many, and e&s;pecially in matters which have been indu&s;triou&s;ly di&s;gui&s;ed by men of Art, will venture to promi&s;e? yet this I can &s;afely &s;ay, that I have not made one but what I thought I had &s;ome ground for; And as to</HI> matters of fact, <HI>I do a&s;&s;ure the Reader, that in the matter of the</HI> Mi&s;&s;ions, <HI>I have &s;et down few or none, but what I had out of</HI> Roman-Catholick Writers, <HI>and licen&s;ed by the</HI> Inqui&s;ition, <HI>and who for the mo&s;t part were</HI> Je&s;uits.</P>
<P><HI>There are</HI> Four things, <HI>whereof, if I am not mi|&s;taken, this Hi&s;tory will abundantly &s;atisfy the Im|partial Reader.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The</HI> Fir&s;t <HI>is, That the</HI> Roman Mi&s;&s;ionaries, <HI>but e&s;pecially the</HI> Je&s;uits, <HI>having neither the gift of Mi|racles, nor of Patience, to wait for the &s;low i&s;&s;ues of the old method of converting Nations by preaching the Faith to them, are every where (where they can come at them) for di&s;patching it with</HI> Dragoons, <HI>or by &s;ome other violent and &s;anguinary way. The</HI> Je&s;uits <HI>being all to a man of the &s;ame opinion with their great Apo&s;tle of the</HI> Indies, Francis Xaveir, <HI>who&s;e Maxim, as</HI> Ravarette <HI>informs us, was:</HI> Mientras no e&s;tiuveron debaxo del Mo&s;quete, no avia de ver Chri&s;tiano de provecho; <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> Mi&s;&s;ionaries without Muskets do never make Converts to any purpo&s;e: <HI>The truth of which Maxim,</HI> John Bolunte, <HI>a Mi&s;&s;ionary Je|&s;uit, tells us, is confirmed by univer&s;al Experience.</HI> Ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">el Bra&s;il <HI>(&s;aith he)</HI> Peru, Mexico, Flo|rida, Philipinas, y Maluca, ha havido Chri|&s;tianidad,
<PB REF="4">ni Conver&s;ion, &s;inla &s;ombra de vel Poder Secular; <HI>that is,</HI> Neither in the Bra&s;ils, Peru, Mexico, Florida, the Philipins, or Ma|luca, have any Conver&s;ions been made, with|out the help of the Secular Power; <HI>affirming in another place of his Book,</HI> Que en nenguna parte &s;e ha hecho fruto &s;in Armas, <HI>that is,</HI> That Mi&s;&s;ionaries have done nothing any where, without Military Arms.</P>
<P><HI>The</HI> Second <HI>is, That there is no Tyranny in the World equal to that which the</HI> Roman Prelates <HI>(where they have the Secular Arm at their com|mand) do continually exerci&s;e, and that without the common relentings of humanity, upon all &s;orts of people, that will not turn to their Religion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The</HI> Third <HI>is, That</HI> Mi&s;&s;ionaries, <HI>when ever they have in&s;pired a Prince, the main Body of who&s;e Subjects are Anti-papi&s;ts, with a bigotry to introduce their Religion into his Country, do commonly before they have done with him, either run him out of breath, or make him run his head again&s;t a wall.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The</HI> Fourth <HI>is, That</HI> Ambition <HI>did very early take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the</HI> Je&s;uits Order, <HI>that</HI> Society <HI>not being above ten years &s;tanding in the World, when it had engro&s;&s;ed a Mi&s;&s;ion to it &s;elf, which did promi&s;e both greater and cheaper Honours to its Mi|ni&s;ters than ever any</HI> Mi&s;&s;ion <HI>had done before.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The clear di&s;covery of which Truths, together with that of the true Spirit and Temper of</HI> Mi&s;&s;io|naries, <HI>and the Precipices they put Princes upon, who are &s;o unhappy as to be their Converts, mu&s;t make</HI> This Hi&s;tory <HI>to be of &s;ome u&s;e to all</HI> Prote&s;tant <HI>Countreys, which may therein, as in a gla&s;s &s;ee, what treatment they are to expect from Popery, when ever the Supream Power is in its hands.</HI></P>
<PB REF="5">
<P><HI>I have as an Appendix, given the Reader an Epitome of the</HI> Dominican <HI>Hi&s;tory of</HI> Ethiopia, <HI>writ by a Friar of that Order, and printed at</HI> Va|lentia, <HI>in the Year</HI> 1610. <HI>and not only licen&s;ed by the</HI> Inqui&s;ition, <HI>and all the other Regular and Se|cular Licen&s;ers of the Dioce&s;s, but recommended like|wi&s;e by them to the World, as a true, u&s;eful, and edifying Hi&s;tory: As al&s;o a Full Account of the Pra|cti&s;es and Conviction of</HI> Maria <HI>of the</HI> Annuncia|tion, <HI>the Famous</HI> Lisbon <HI>Nun; which I take to be two &s;uch Originals in their &s;everal kinds, as are not ea&s;ily to be met with.</HI></P>

<P>When the Emperor, who had always been very kind to them, came to Die, he gave them both their Liberty; but as they were pre|paring to make u&s;e of it and return home, the Queen Regent was importunate with them to &s;tay, and to undertake the Tutelage of her Son till he was of Age, which they having con&s;ented to, did during that time, write to all the <HI>Roman</HI> Merchants re&s;iding in the ports of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> that were Chri&s;tians, to a&s;&s;emble together to Wor&s;hip God, as they them&s;elves, and the Converts they had made at Court, did Daily.</P>
<P>When their Pupil came to take the Admi|ni&s;tration of the Government upon him&s;elf, they both de&s;ired Leave to return home, which having obtained with great difficulty, they left <HI>Ethiopia; Aede&s;ius</HI> went to <HI>Tire</HI> to live with his Relations; but <HI>Frumentius</HI> ha|ving a greater love for his Religion, repaired directly to <HI>Alexandria,</HI> with an intention to acquaint the Bi&s;hop thereof, who at that time was the Great <HI>Athana&s;ius,</HI> with the footing Chri&s;tianity had taken in <HI>Ethiopia.</HI></P>

<P>But it is no matter whether it was a Fiction
<PB N="29" REF="27">or a Reality, &s;o long as it furni&s;hed a good pretence, for a pre&s;ent turn, and tended to the Di&s;paragement of the Council of <HI>Ba&s;il,</HI> which, together with the ground it &s;tood upon, was blown up purely by Tricks of this nature; <HI>the Yoke</HI> the Council of <HI>Con&s;tance</HI> had laid on the Neck of the <HI>Papacy,</HI> being broke by Pre|tences, of the <HI>Greek</HI> and all other Churches and Patriarchs having &s;ubmitted them&s;elves to it.</P>
<P>This is all that I have been able to meet with in <HI>Greek</HI> or <HI>Latin</HI> Hi&s;tory concerning the Church of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> before the Year 1490, when it was fir&s;t di&s;covered by the <HI>Portugue&s;es.</HI> And as for Hi&s;tories of their own, I do not find they have any, be&s;ides &s;ome Fabulous Legends of the Lives of their Monks; of which I &s;hall only give the Reader a Ta&s;te.</P>
<P>In the Life of <HI>Tecla Haymanot,</HI> the mo&s;t fa|mous of all their Monks both for Piety and Miracles, the following Account of the Suc|ce&s;&s;ion of their Grand Abbots is given.</P>
<P>The Angel St. <HI>Michael</HI> gave the Cowl to St. <HI>Anthony;</HI> St. <HI>Anthony</HI> gave it to St. <HI>Macari|us; Macarius</HI> gave it to <HI>Pachomius; Pachomius</HI> to Abbot <HI>Araguni,</HI> or <HI>Michael,</HI> who was one of the Nine Monks that came into <HI>Ethiopia; Araguni</HI> gave it to <HI>Bazana; Bazana</HI> to <HI>Maz|ralmoa; Mazralmoa</HI> to Abbot <HI>John; John</HI> to Abbot <HI>Je&s;us; Je&s;us</HI> to <HI>Tecla Haymanot,</HI> to whom Chri&s;t appeared, and promi&s;ed, that who&s;oever &s;hould kill a Serpent upon a <HI>Friday,</HI> &s;hould be pardoned all the Sins he had com|mitted in Forty Years.</P>
<PB N="30" REF="28">
<P>But notwith&s;tanding the Lives of the <HI>Ha|ba&s;&s;in</HI> Monks are all of a piece with the Lives of all the other Monks that are extant, that is, extreamly fabulous; yet this mu&s;t be &s;aid for them, that Monkery continues to this day much the &s;ame among them, as it was in the beginning, from which in the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> it is &s;o &s;trangely degenerated.</P>
<P>For in <HI>Haba&s;&s;ia,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monkery much the &s;ame in <HI>Haba&s;&s;ia,</HI> as it was in the begin|ning.</NOTE> any one that has a mind to be a Monk, retires thereupon to the De&s;art, where he puts on what Habit he plea&s;eth, or judgeth to be mo&s;t &s;utable to his preten&s;ions. Their Obligation &s;o long as they profe&s;s them&s;elves Monks, which they are always at their liberty to give over, is to fa&s;t every day in the Year till three a Clock in the After|noon, and to A&s;&s;emble together at Midnight, and at other certain Hours to perform their Devotions; they do generally exerci&s;e great Au&s;terities upon them&s;elves, being very &s;trict in their Fa&s;ts, many of them eating but once in two days, and &s;ome never but upon <HI>Sun|days;</HI> &s;ome of them are &s;aid to have made Holes in the Trunks of Trees, and to have lodged in them till the Trees have grown to &s;hut them in.</P>
<P>Their Mona&s;tries are more like Villages than <HI>Roman</HI> Convents,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Mona|&s;tries are little Vil|lages.</NOTE> every Monk having his di&s;tinct dwelling Hou&s;e with as much Land laid to it, as a Man is able to cultivate, and when they come to dye they di&s;po&s;e of their Goods as they plea&s;e, only the Land re|mains &s;till to the Mona&s;tries. Now this cour&s;e falls in exactly with that of the Primitive Monks, who always lived in De&s;erts, where
<PB N="31" REF="28">they work'd hard, and were under no Vows; whereas the <HI>Roman</HI> Monks have their Mona|&s;tries in or near Princes Courts, and in all Populous Cities; and tho generally hurried into that Profe&s;&s;ion, either by their Parents, or by &s;ome &s;udden fit of Melancholy, are fet|tered in it by Vows for their Lives, and are &s;o far from putting their Hand to any work, that they are every where become proverbial for Lazine&s;s; and as for their Buildings, they are much more like Palaces than the Dwel|lings of People that have renounced the World, and taken a Vow of Poverty upon them.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t famous of all their Mona&s;tries, is that of <HI>Alelujah,</HI> wherein formerly there are &s;aid to have been 40000 Monks together, all the Country about having been given to the Monks thereof to cultivate.</P>
<P>I do not find that any &s;ort of Learning did ever flouri&s;h among the <HI>Haba&s;&s;ins,</HI> &s;o that they have but few Books be&s;ides the Bible, the Canons of the fir&s;t Councils, the Homilies of the <HI>Greek</HI> Fathers, and the Lives of their Saints.</P>

<PB N="82" REF="54">is known to none but the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This Son in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was the Word with God, and God was the Word: The Spirit of the Father, the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of the Son the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit its own Spirit; without any diminution or augmentation: That Holy Spirit is the Comforter of the living God, <HI>who proceedeth from the Father and the Son,</HI> and <HI>who &s;pake by the mouth of the Prophets,</HI> and <HI>de&s;|cended in a flame of fire on the Apo&s;tles in the gate of Sion,</HI> and <HI>who preached the word of the Father,</HI> which Word the very Son was all over the World; wherefore as the Father is not fir&s;t, notwith&s;tanding he is the Father; nor the Son la&s;t, notwith&s;tanding he is the Son; &s;o likewi&s;e the Holy Spirit is neither fir&s;t nor la&s;t, but they are Three Per&s;ons in One God, who &s;eeth, and is &s;een by no-body; and who by his only Council created all things. The Son did of his own accord, the Father being willing, and the Holy Gho&s;t con&s;enting, de&s;|cend from his highe&s;t Habitation, and was incarnate by the Holy Spirit in the Womb of the Virgin <HI>Mary;</HI> who was adorned with a double Virginity, the one Spiritual, the other Carnal; he was born without any Corrup|tion, his Mother, <HI>Mary,</HI> remaining a Virgin after her delivery; and by a Miracle, and a &s;ecret Flame of the Divinity brought forth her Son Je&s;us, without blood, and without pain; who was perfectly Innocent, and without Sin; being perfect God, and perfect Man; and having only one A&s;pect, he grew by de|grees
<PB N="83" REF="54">as an Infant, &s;ucking the Milk of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> his Mother; and coming to Thirty Years of Age, he was baptiz'd in <HI>Jor|dan,</HI> and did walk, and was weary, and did hunger and thir&s;t, as other men do; all the&s;e things he &s;uffered voluntarily, and of his own accord, and wrought many Miracles; re&s;to|ring, by the power of his Divinity, &s;ight to the Blind, curing the Lame, clean&s;ing the <HI>Lepers,</HI> rai&s;ing the Dead; after all which, he him&s;elf was apprehended, and whipt, and &s;courged, and crucified: He langui&s;hed and died for our Sins, and by his Death over|came Death, and the Devil; and by his lively Agony di&s;&s;olved our Sins, and bore our Infir|mities: By the Bapti&s;m of his Blood, that is, his Death, he baptized the Patriarchs, and Prophets, and de&s;cended into Hell, where the Souls of <HI>Adam</HI> and his Sons were, as al&s;o his own Soul, which was from <HI>Adam,</HI> which Soul Chri&s;t received from the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> who by the power and &s;plendor of his Divi|nity, and the &s;trength of his Cro&s;s, broke the brazen fiery Gates of Hell, binding <HI>Satan</HI> with Iron Chains, and re&s;cuing <HI>Adam</HI> and his Sons. All the&s;e things Chri&s;t did, becau&s;e he was full of the Divinity; and the Divinity it &s;elf was with his Soul, as it was al&s;o with his mo&s;t holy Body, which Divinity gave vir|tue to the Cro&s;s, and was what he always had, and will have for ever, in Trinity and Unity in common with the Father: Neither did Chri&s;t, during the time he was in the Fle&s;h, ever want the Divinity and Dignity thereof for one moment.

<P>When they have cho&s;en a Patriarch, they &s;eal up their Votes, and tran&s;mit them by the Emperor's Me&s;&s;enger, to the Patriarch of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> re&s;iding at <HI>Grand Cairo,</HI> who im|mediately con&s;ecrates the Monk that is cho&s;en to that great Dignity, and &s;ends him with the Me&s;&s;enger into <HI>Ethiopia.</HI> The Per&s;on elected,
<PB N="112" REF="69">according to ancient cu&s;tom, mu&s;t be a Monk of the Order of St. <HI>Anthony</HI> the Hermit; and who when he arrives in <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> is there re|ceived with great Joy and Honour. This Af|fair is not &s;ometimes fini&s;hed under a Year or two; during which Vacancy, all the Rents of the Patriarch are paid to <HI>Precious John.</HI> The chief bu&s;ine&s;s of the Patriarch <HI>is to con|fer Holy Orders,</HI> which none be&s;ides him can either give or take away. He collates to no Bi|&s;hopricks, nor any other Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Bene|fices; which are all in the Gift of <HI>Precious John,</HI> who be&s;tows them as he thinks good. When the Patriarch, who&s;e Revenues are ve|ry great, dieth, the Emperor is his &s;ole Heir. It is furthermore the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Patriarch to excommunicate all &s;uch as are ob&s;tinate; to which Cen&s;ures there is &s;o great a Re&s;pect paid, that all who &s;light them are condemned for their whole life to a &s;trict and perpetual Fa&s;t. He <HI>grants no Indulgences,</HI> neither are the Sacraments of the Church denied to any Sinners, but Murtherers.</P>
<P>The Patriarch in our Tongue is called <HI>Abu|na;</HI> only he who at pre&s;ent is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that Dignity, is called by his Bapti&s;mal Name, which is <HI>Mark;</HI> he is an Hundred Years of Age and upward.</P>

<PB N="113" REF="69">
<P>The Go&s;pel and Faith of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t was fir&s;t preached among us by <HI>Philip</HI> the Apo&s;tle. If you would know the name of our Emperor, it is always Precious <HI>John,</HI> and not Presbyter <HI>John,</HI> as it is here fal&s;ly reported to be in our Language: It is <HI>John Belul,</HI> and in the <HI>Chalde, John Encoo,</HI> or Pre|cious or High <HI>John:</HI> Neither is he ever called, as <HI>Matthew</HI> fal&s;ly reported, Emperor of the <HI>Haba&s;&s;ins,</HI> but of the <HI>Ethiopians;</HI> for he being an <HI>Armenian</HI> did not thoroughly under&s;tand our Affairs, and lea&s;t of all tho&s;e relating to our Faith; which made him report &s;everal things to the wi&s;e King <HI>Emanuel</HI> of happy Memory, that were fal&s;e; which was not done by him with an intention to deceive; for he was an hone&s;t Man, but becau&s;e he was not well In&s;tructed in the Matters of our Reli|gion.</P>
<P>The Empire does not of right de&s;cend to the Elde&s;t Son, but to him on whom the Em|peror is plea&s;ed to be&s;tow it. So the pre&s;ent Emperor was the third Brother, and got the Crown by a Pious piece of Reverence: For the la&s;t Emperor having when he was upon his Death-Bed commanded all his Sons to &s;it down by him on Royal Thrones, they all did &s;o, except my Ma&s;ter, who &s;aid, <HI>Far be it from me to &s;it in the Chair of my Lord;</HI> for which act of Piety, his Father be&s;towed the Empire up|on him. His Name is <HI>David,</HI> and his Domi|nions of Chri&s;tians and Heathens are very large, in which there are divers Kings, Prin|ces, Earls, Barons and Nobles, who are all extreamly &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to his commands.

<P>But notwith&s;tanding the King and the whole Court honoured this Con&s;ecration with their pre&s;ence, yet I do not find that any of <HI>the great Prelates</HI> of the Kingdom were pre|&s;ent at it; which, together with its not ha|ving been performed in <HI>the See Church,</HI> but in the Chappel of a Convent, and that by

<P>There were two things, one would think, might have been &s;ome rubs in the way of this promotion, though we do not find they were in the lea&s;t.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t was, That there was a Patriarch, and one of the Pope's own Confirming, then living in <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> of whom we &s;hall hear more hereafter.</P>
<P>The &s;econd was, the Vow that is taken by the Je&s;uits, never directly nor indirectly to &s;eek after any Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Promotion, either

<P>But however the Clergy &s;tood affected, the King was extreamly plea&s;ed with this Promotion, and pre&s;ented the Patriarch with extraordinary rich Ve&s;tments, and with a noble &s;et of Plate for his own Altar; all which, upon this Mi&s;&s;ion mi&s;carrying, was afterwards given by King <HI>Seba&s;tian</HI> to the Je&s;uits College at <HI>Goa,</HI> where the Patriarch had lodged it.</P>

<PB N="163" REF="94">the Court, who were all permitted to be pre|&s;ent at the Ceremony. In which Letters our Lord the King having acquainted him with his intention of &s;ending one of his Courtiers, with a certain number of Friars of Good lives and found Doctrine next year to him; the King when he heard that, was all of a &s;udden in a great di&s;order, and had his thoughts &s;o taken up with it, that when we &s;poke to him, he never returned us any an|&s;wer that was to the purpo&s;e, but di&s;mi&s;&s;ed us to return to our Tents. Within two or three days after this Audience, the King took a Progre&s;s to vi&s;it his Grandmother, who lived at a place that was Eight or Ten days Journey from the Camp, in which he left us, without having given any order about our Entertainment, and without &s;ending us &s;o much as any thing of a Complement: So that I do not know what would have become of us, had not an honourable <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> car|ried us to his Hou&s;e, which was Two or Three Leagues from the Camp, and Enter|tained us there till the King returned, which he did not in a Month.</P>
<P>During that time I compo&s;ed a Treati&s;e of the Errors of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> and of the Truth of our Holy Faith, with an intention to have pre&s;ented it to the King; who, as I was told by a <HI>Potugue&s;e</HI> that was much in his Favour, had no kindne&s;s for the <HI>Roman Pontiff,</HI> and had &s;aid openly, <HI>That he &s;tood in no need of the Friars the King of</HI> Portugal <HI>was &s;o forward to &s;end him, being fully re&s;olved never to &s;ubmit him|&s;elf to the</HI> Roman Church.</P>

<P>Now the Treati&s;e I had compo&s;ed being in <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> it was nece&s;&s;ary if I would have the King to read it, to get it Tran&s;lated into <HI>Chaldee;</HI> whereupon I writ a Letter to the King him&s;elf, to de&s;ire him to let me have a couple of Learned Monks to Tran&s;late the Truths of our Faith into <HI>Chaldee,</HI> I having put them together on purpo&s;e to &s;hew how little rea&s;on his people had to call us of the <HI>Roman</HI> Communion, <HI>Hereticks;</HI> and to affirm that we were wor&s;e than <HI>Mahometans;</HI> and being informed that the <HI>Haba&s;&s;ins</HI> had a Book among them, written by the <HI>Schi&s;maticks</HI> and <HI>Hereticks</HI> of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> from whence they have their <HI>Abuna</HI>'s, having paid a Tribute to the <HI>Turk</HI> for that priviledge, Entituled, <HI>The Adultery of the</HI> Franks; wherein, among other things, the Council of <HI>Calcedon</HI> is condemned, pretending that it taught that there were Four Per&s;ons in the Holy Trinity; and we are
<PB N="165" REF="95">likewi&s;e charged with divers Errors, I begg'd of the King that I might have a &s;ight of that Book.</P>
<P>The King would not let me have the Book, and was very angry that I had been told of it; but as to the Monks I had de&s;ired, he order|ed a couple to come to me, but they had not well begun the Tran&s;lation, before either out of fear that the King would be di&s;plea&s;ed with them if they went on with it, or becau&s;e he had privately Commanded them not to do it, they gave it over; &s;o that I was obliged to repair to a <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Captain to &s;peak to them to fini&s;h it; who with much ado pre|vailed with them to go on: The Interpreter on my &s;ide was a worthy <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> who un|der&s;tood both the Languages well.</P>
<P>Having at la&s;t got my Treati&s;e Tran&s;lated, the next thing I had to do, was to get it writ|ten out fair, and having de&s;ired an Amanuen|&s;is of the King to do it for me, after having granted me one, he repented pre&s;ently, and &s;ent me word, That if I would let him &s;ee my Treati&s;e as it was, he would read it over, and that otherwi&s;e he would never trouble him&s;elf with it; &s;o I was obliged to carry it to him as it was, having fir&s;t dated it, and put my name to it; it bore date the 20th. of <HI>Au|gu&s;t.</HI> When I delivered it to him, I was ac|companied by a <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Captain, and Seven or Eight more of the &s;ame Nation: and af|ter having paid the cu&s;tomary Obei&s;ances, I began a &s;hort &s;peech concerning the occa&s;ion of my coming into <HI>Ethiopia;</HI> but the King in|terrupted me, and began to talk of other
<PB N="166" REF="96">things, as one prepared to ward off the blows that I had de&s;igned to have given him; when I had put my Treati&s;e into his hand, he be|gun to read in it, but had read but a little way, before he was put into &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ion by it, as made him vomit out the poi&s;on he had &s;o long concealed, telling me, I had de|&s;ired leave to &s;et down the Truths of my own Faith, and to have &s;ome Monks to Tran&s;late them into <HI>Chaldee,</HI> but in&s;tead of that, I had charged tho&s;e with Errors who had none; he told me further, That that was a work no ways proper for a &s;imple Prie&s;t, like me, but was the work of &s;ome Great Bi&s;hop, or Pre|late, like the Pope. I made an&s;wer, It was true I was but a mean man, but the things I had &s;et down were neverthele&s;s the Truths of the Go&s;pel, and of the Holy Councils, whom, and not me, I de&s;ired his Highne&s;s to hear. He told me, I had impo&s;ed &s;everal things up|on them which they never held. I replied, I knew very well that his Highne&s;s was in no Error of Faith, but that his Subjects were; and that I had &s;et down nothing but what was true, and what I was ready to demon|&s;trate to him. He &s;aid, He was no friend to Di&s;putations, but there was one thing he was certain of, which was that <HI>Ethiopia</HI> had always held the &s;ame Faith that it did now, or at lea&s;t that it had for above a Thou&s;and years; that Di&s;putations were never to be u&s;ed but with <HI>Heathens,</HI> and that his Faith being thus Ancient, there was no body before me had ever pre&s;umed to &s;ay it was Erroneous.</P>
<PB N="167" REF="96">
<P>To this I an&s;wered, That God did &s;ome|times for peoples Sins &s;uffer &s;uch things, and that his Highne&s;s had rea&s;on to thank God, for having in his time vi&s;ited <HI>Ethiopia</HI> with the truth of the Go&s;pel: He &s;aid the Catholick Church was divided into four Chairs, and that they had from the beginning been &s;ubject to one of them: I repli'd, it was true, but &s;o it was likewi&s;e, that all Churches were Anci|ently &s;ubject to the <HI>Roman</HI> Bi&s;hop, who was above all the re&s;t, as his Highne&s;s was above his Subjects; in&s;omuch that the three other Chairs for having denied obedience to the <HI>Ro|man,</HI> were all become Schi&s;matical, together with all tho&s;e who were &s;ubject to them; That his Highne&s;s if he would be plea&s;ed to peru&s;e my Treati&s;e, would therein meet with full An&s;wers to all his Objections, exhorting him to take care not to make him&s;elf of that number of People the Prophet &s;peaks of, who would not under&s;tand, that they might do well.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Em|peror's de|fence of him&s;elf and his Faith.</NOTE> Af|ter a great deal of arguing, I told him that my de&s;ign in writing that Paper, was to di&s;cover how his mind &s;tood di&s;po&s;ed towards the Pope, and the Learned Friars which his Brother the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> was about to &s;end to him; for that if he was not willing that they &s;hould come, it would be to no purpo&s;e for the King to &s;end them &s;o far; I did therefore be&s;eech his Highne&s;s to declare whether he intended to &s;ubmit him&s;elf to the Pope as he had promi|&s;ed; he &s;aid he had learned Friars enough in his Kingdom, and that it was needle&s;s for the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> to trouble him&s;elf to &s;end him any more; and as for the Pope, That he had
<PB N="168" REF="97">never yielded him any obedience; that Submi&s;|&s;ion, that was carried to him, by <HI>Ga&s;per de Magalhaens,</HI> being what he had never made, and was either a trick or mi&s;take of the Monk who Tran&s;lated his Letters to the King of <HI>Por|tugal;</HI> concluding, That he was re&s;olved never to yield Obedience to any Patriarch, but the Patriarch of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> whom he would al|ways obey, as all his Ance&s;tors had done be|fore him. When I found the King thus ab&s;o|lutely determined, I took my leave of him; who after I was gone, begun to extol me for a mighty Scholar, &s;aying, <HI>He wondered how it was po&s;&s;ible for &s;o young a man to have attained to &s;o great a &s;tock of Learning:</HI> I was told like|wi&s;e that he read my Treati&s;e over, and that after he had once read it, it was &s;eldom out of his Hand, and that he was &s;till &s;hewing it to his Mother, and Brothers, and the Grandees of the Court; and that upon the <HI>Abuna</HI>'s ha|ving denounced an Excommunication again&s;t all that &s;hould read it, the King had &s;ent to him for leave to read it again, and was put in|to &s;uch a Pa&s;&s;ion, by the <HI>Abuna</HI>'s having de|ny'd it to him, that he called him <HI>Mahometan,</HI> and <HI>Heretick,</HI> &s;aying, <HI>He would read the</HI> Alco|ran <HI>of</HI> Mahomet <HI>him&s;elf, and at the &s;ame time not give him leave to read a godly Book;</HI> com|manding him thereupon &s;ince he was their <HI>Abuna,</HI> to an&s;wer a Book that was written by a poor Clerk who had no Dignity: To which the <HI>Abuna</HI>'s an&s;wer was, <HI>That he did not come into</HI> Ethiopia <HI>to di&s;pute, but to confer holy Or|ders.</HI></P>

<P>Thus much of <HI>Rodriguez</HI>'s Relation the Je|&s;uits have thought fit to make publick; in which, notwith&s;tanding there is not one word of the Patriarch <HI>Bermudes;</HI> yet that does not hinder it from having been <HI>Rodriguez</HI>'s chief if not only bu&s;ine&s;s in <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> to fetch him from thence.

<P><HI>Tellez</HI> the Je&s;uit apprehending that this Blot of their fir&s;t Prelate's having been an U&s;ur|per, might at &s;ome time or other come to be hit, has endeavoured to cover it, by affirm|ing that <HI>Bermudes</HI> was never Patriarch of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> but of <HI>Alexandria;</HI> for which he quotes both a Treati&s;e of his own, and his Tomb&s;tone in the Church of St. <HI>Seba&s;tian Pe|dreiro</HI> in <HI>Lisbon,</HI> in both which, &s;aith <HI>Tellez,</HI> he is &s;tiled Patriarch of <HI>Alexandria:</HI> But if this be not to cut a knot that he is not able to un|tye, nothing is &s;o; for be&s;ides that all the Hi|&s;torians of his time &s;peak of him &s;till as Patri|arch of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> all of them, the Je&s;uits not excepted, agreeing that the Pope gave <HI>Bermu|des</HI> no new Orders or Title, but only con|firm'd tho&s;e that had been conferr'd on him by the <HI>Abuna</HI> and Emperor of <HI>Ethiopia;</HI> who it is certain did never pretend to make a Pa|triarch of <HI>Alexandria.</HI> It is a Je&s;t for any one to think that the Pope would be&s;tow the &s;econd Title in the Church upon an ob&s;cure Itinerant, and who was ordained <HI>per &s;altum</HI> by a &s;ingle <HI>Ethiopian</HI> Bi&s;hop.</P>

<P>As to <HI>Tellez</HI>'s two Authorities for <HI>Bermudes</HI> having been Patriarch of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> all that can be &s;aid to them is, That if there be any &s;uch things, they mu&s;t have been foi&s;ted into tho&s;e Monuments, by tho&s;e who were con|cerned to have him pa&s;s for Patriarch of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and not of <HI>Ethiopia:</HI> Tho by the way, it is &s;omewhat &s;trange, that <HI>Tellez,</HI> who lived mo&s;t of his time within a Mile of the Church of St. <HI>Seba&s;tian Pedreira,</HI> &s;hould not quote that Tomb&s;tone upon his own know|ledge, but upon the Authority of a Book. Farthermore, &s;uppo&s;ing <HI>Bermudes</HI> to have had the Title of <HI>Alexandria</HI> given him by the Pope, that does not hinder but that he might have been <HI>Abuna</HI> of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> too; it being the Pope's common practice to confer the <HI>Oriental</HI> Patriarchates upon Prelates that are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of other great Bi&s;hopricks: So Cardinal <HI>Bo|niface</HI> was Bi&s;hop of <HI>Tu&s;culum,</HI> and Patriarch of <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> and Cardinal <HI>Cajetanus</HI> was Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Capua,</HI> and Patriarch of <HI>Anti|och:</HI> And I do not believe there is one Pre&s;i|dent for the Popes having ever conferred any of tho&s;e high Titles upon any Prelate that had not another Bi&s;hoprick.</P>

<P>This was publi&s;hed in our Church of <HI>De|come</HI> on the 2d. of <HI>February</HI> 1559.

<P><HI>As to your having commanded me to go to the I&s;land of</HI> Japan <HI>by the fir&s;t convenience, I have had no opportunity &s;ince I received your Commands, and &s;o am excu&s;ed for not being gone; neither in truth can I embark here with any &s;afety, there be|ing a thou&s;and</HI> Turki&s;h <HI>Ships, and not one Chri|&s;tian in the Port of</HI> Matzua <HI>at this time.

</LETTER>
<P>This Letter of the Patriarch's gives the Reader a clear view of the true temper of the <HI>Roman</HI> Mi&s;&s;ionaries, and of the methods they are for making u&s;e of in the Conver&s;ion of <HI>Heretical</HI> Kingdoms to the <HI>Roman</HI> Church; it di&s;clo&s;eth likewi&s;e the true &s;ecret of <HI>Bahurnagays</HI>'s Rebellion,
<PB N="220" REF="123">which was of &s;uch fatal con&s;equence to <HI>Ethiopia;</HI> it being &s;aid in this Letter, That the Coadjutor before he left <HI>Goa,</HI> had a pro|mi&s;e that a good Body of <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> &s;hould be &s;ent after him; as it is al&s;o, that if the&s;e Troops had arrived when they were expected, which was when <HI>Bahurnagays</HI> was fir&s;t in Arms, the <HI>Haba&s;&s;in</HI> Church had been reduced to the Obedience of the <HI>Roman</HI> before the writing of that Letter.</P>
<P>Now what &s;hould it be that hindered the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Government, which &s;till pretended that the propagating of the <HI>Ro|man</HI> Faith, was its chief aim in all its remote Conque&s;ts, and who&s;e title to them all, was founded &s;olely on that pretence, from &s;ending &s;uch a handful of Men, to do the Church &s;o &s;ignal a &s;ervice as the Con|verting of another <HI>Europe</HI> to it?</P>
<P>It was not that they were fearful that the Number of Soldiers that was de&s;ired,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The rea|&s;on why the <HI>Portu|gue&s;es</HI> &s;ent no Troops into <HI>Ethio|pia,</HI> when &s;o &s;trong|ly &s;olici|ted to do it.</NOTE> would not have been able to have done that great work, for that con&s;idering what was done by <HI>Gama</HI> with a &s;maller number, and that it is not common with the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> to di&s;tru&s;t their own &s;trength in &s;uch ca&s;es; whatever was, this could not be the cau&s;e of it; and if this was not, one may venture to &s;ay, it was not that they reckoned it a &s;candalous thing to go about to Convert an <HI>Heretical</HI> King|dom by Dragoon Mi&s;&s;ionaries, that being a thing, as the Patriarch truly ob&s;erves in his Letter, <HI>That no true</HI> Roman <HI>Catholick could be offended at.</HI></P>
<PB N="221" REF="123">
<P>The true cau&s;e therefore of their de|nying &s;o incon&s;iderable an aid to do &s;o great a work, though &s;o vehemently &s;oli|cited to do it, was, that though at fir&s;t they had promi&s;ed them&s;elves great mat|ters from the reduction of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> to the Obedience of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, they found afterwards that the doing of it would be of little or no advantage to them, by rea&s;on of its lying quite out of the way of their great <HI>Indian</HI> Trade, and its having no native Commodities to countervail the great Charge, its remote|ne&s;s, and the neighbourhood of the <HI>Turks,</HI> would nece&s;&s;arily put them too, to main|tain an intere&s;t in it.</P>
<P>Neither were the Patriarch and Fathers &s;uch weak Men as not to know at what their bu&s;ine&s;s &s;tuck, who therefore took care in all their Letters to a&s;&s;ure the Go|vernment, that be&s;ides divers other Commodi|ties, there was <HI>abundance of Fine Gold</HI> in &s;ome parts of <HI>Ethiopia;</HI> and that <HI>Damut,</HI> which might ea&s;ily be Converted by 600 Soldiers, and <HI>which was likewi&s;e full of Gold,</HI> did reach to <HI>Mo&s;ambique</HI> and <HI>Sefala,</HI> the be&s;t <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Plantation in the <HI>Indies;</HI> but the Government, it &s;eems, either did <HI>not believe the&s;e reports,</HI> or thought they <HI>&s;hould Buy fine Gold there too dear to turn to any account.</HI></P>
<P>So that the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ter had this among other In&s;tances undoubtedly in his eye, who told <HI>Philip</HI> the IVth. <HI>That it was a vain conceit the World had entertained of
<PB N="222" REF="124">the Zeal of the</HI> Portugue&s;es <HI>upon the ac|count of the Conver&s;ions which had been made by them in the</HI> Indies; <HI>for it was Covetou&s;ne&s;s and not Zeal that had engaged them to make all tho&s;e Conque&s;ts; the Con|ver&s;ions that had been made in tho&s;e parts having been performed by the Divine Power, and the Charity of a few particular Friars, the Crown and Government having had no other aim therein, but the Robbing of King|doms and Cities; and there were &s;till the greate&s;t Conver&s;ions where there was mo&s;t to gratifie their Covetou&s;ne&s;s; but where there was nothing to be had, there the People were Obdurate and not to be wrought upon.

<P>The Cardinal-Regent having prevailed with the Pope to recal the Patriarch, did order <HI>Ruy Laurenco de Tavara,</HI> who went Viceroy to the <HI>Indies</HI> in the year 1567. &s;o &s;oon as he arrived at <HI>Goa,</HI> to &s;end &s;ome Ships to <HI>Ethiopia</HI> to fetch off the Patriarch and the Fathers; but <HI>Tavara</HI> happening to die in the Voyage, tho&s;e Orders, whatever was the rea&s;on, were never executed; though if they had, &s;o &s;oon as it was po&s;&s;ible, the Ships would have come too late for the Patriarch, who died at <HI>Fremona</HI> on the 9th.

And if the Prie&s;t &s;hould happen to have the courage to ask him, Why, if tho&s;e People are under his care, he had aban|doned them for &s;o long a time? And whether he thought that one who had &s;o de&s;erted his Flock, ought any longer to be e&s;teemed its Pa&s;tor? The Je&s;uit will an&s;wer him with, What Authority have you to ask me any &s;uch que&s;tion? Or to med|dle with things that do not belong to you? And ha|ving affirmed that he has a right to what he pre|tends to, he will produce the Council of</HI> Trent, <HI>and read the Con&s;titution to him,</HI> Which prohibits Prie&s;ts upon pain of Excommunication to

And in ca&s;e the &s;aid Father &s;hould reply, That the words of the Council have no relation to the Countries of</HI> Infidels, <HI>or to places which are newly Converted, or to</HI> Chri&s;tians <HI>who are Novices in the Faith, but are to be under&s;tood only of Countries which have been under</HI> Chri&s;tian <HI>Princes for divers Ages, and of ancient Pari&s;hes where People have been long Chri&s;tians; The Je&s;uit &s;hall, notwith&s;tand|ing that, treat him publickly as a Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or of the Council, and do all that is in his power to drive him away, forbidding the People to take any no|tice of him, or to have any communication with him; and if after that, any Chri&s;tian &s;hould, ei|ther out of Compa&s;&s;ion or Devotion, receive him in|to his Hou&s;e, or &s;hould enter him&s;elf into the Bro|therhood of the</HI> Ro&s;ary, <HI>or of the</HI> Cord of St. Francis, <HI>he &s;hall be reprimanded for it as boi&s;te|rou&s;ly, and be treated by the Je&s;uit with as much contempt, as if he had intirely renounced the Chri|&s;tian Faith.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And as to the places where the Je&s;uits are ordi|narily re&s;ident, the Faithful dare not &s;o much as offer to entertain a Friar that is not of their Order, nor have the lea&s;t communication with &s;uch a one, unle&s;s it be privately; and if the Je&s;uits come to hear of it, they will Cha&s;ti&s;e them &s;everely for it; which point they carry &s;o far, as not to &s;uffer any to be of their Congregations that are of a Fraternity of any other Order.</HI> A few lines after <HI>Sotelo</HI> adds: <HI>If Friars who are not of their Society do at any time addre&s;s them&s;elves to the Governor, or
<PB N="244" REF="135">Vicar-General, to demand judicial Informations con|cerning the Martyrdom of any of their Brethren, who have lo&s;t their lives for the Catholick Faith, he will not &s;o much as give them the hearing; whereas in the ca&s;e of any of their own Brethren, or of any that have been Baptized by them, extrava|gant relations are pre&s;ently exhibited, on purpo&s;e to &s;et all the world a talking of them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If any thing that is great and illu&s;trious is done by any other Friars, the Je&s;uits do all that they can either totally to &s;tifle it, or by artifices to eclip&s;e the glory and merit thereof; oppo&s;ing all the underta|kings of all other Friars, and repre&s;enting them as things of little or no benefit; either accu&s;ing what they write of fal&s;hood, or attributing it to envy, or &s;ome other evil pa&s;&s;ion. And when they them&s;elves have at any time been the cau&s;e of any di&s;a&s;ters, let it be never &s;o notorious, they will throw the blame thereof off their own Society, and attribute it to the indi&s;cretion, imprudence, or bad conduct of &s;ome other Friars.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Neither can they endure that any thing &s;hould be begun by People that are not of their Society; and let it be never &s;o vi&s;ible, that their Order is not able alone to &s;upport the burthen of Converting a Coun|trey, yet there is no bringing them to admit of others to help them to bear it.</HI> Finally he tells us, <HI>That at the &s;ame time when the Je&s;uits did all they could to hinder all other Prie&s;ts and Friars from look|ing into</HI> Japan, <HI>that there were but Thirty of their Order in it, which was a very &s;mall number for an I&s;land con&s;i&s;ting of Sixty &s;ix King|doms, and more than Two hundred Prin|ces.</HI></P>

May Chri&s;t our Lord, who is the beginning and end of all things, carry on that Amity and Friend&s;hip which he hath begun be|tween us.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The principal cau&s;e of my writing to your Maje&s;ty at this time, is to renew the Familiarity and Cor|re&s;pondence which was between our Ance&s;tors; which Friend&s;hip, together with the Adoption of the Holy Spirit, has much enobled us. Wherefore we de&s;ire
<PB N="279" REF="152">your Maje&s;ty, to &s;end us &s;ome &s;trong and &s;tout Sol|diers, to help us to beat the Enemy out of our Ports; your Troops when they arrive will find us provided with Arms, and all other nece&s;&s;ary Provi&s;ions of War, and in a readine&s;s to a&s;&s;i&s;t them to the utmo&s;t: It being much fitter that tho&s;e Ports &s;hould be in your Maje&s;ty's hands, than in the hands of the greate&s;t Enemies of our holy Faith; your Maje&s;ty's Ance&s;tors &s;ent an Army of Gallant men into</HI> Ethiopia <HI>at a time when the Enemy was ready to have de&s;troy'd our Faith, and Empire. We might de&s;troy all our Enemies with great ea&s;e, if we were a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the powerful Kings that profe&s;s the Go&s;pel; and who do comfort our hearts with the Memory of heavenly things, we being</HI> all Sons of Heaven, <HI>as St.</HI> John <HI>witne&s;&s;eth, &s;aying,</HI> What is born of the fle&s;h is fle&s;h, and what is born of the Spirit is Spirit. <HI>Furthermore we are at war with another Enemy, who are called</HI> Gauls, <HI>and who do give us much trouble: Wherefore we be&s;eech your Maje&s;ty to &s;end us &s;ome &s;tout Troops, and &s;uch as are Zealous for our holy Apo&s;tolical Faith, and that with all po&s;&s;ible Expedition: We on our part have for &s;ome time been ready to receive them; and if they were once come, it will quickly appear, that all that we de&s;ign is fea&s;ible.

<P>If the&s;e Letters were writ by the <HI>Haba&s;&s;in</HI> Emperor, which I do very much doubt, they plainly di&s;cover that the Fathers chief Argu|ment

<P>Had the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> been &s;o kind as to have publi&s;hed tho&s;e Letters of Father <HI>Peter,</HI> that the&s;e refer to, we might then probably have known the true cau&s;e of that Father's having left <HI>Za Danguil</HI>'s Court &s;o abruptly as he did; but however that were, it is plain from what <HI>Athenateus</HI> writes of the Father's being ac|quainted <HI>with all his Secrets,</HI> &s;o as to be able to <HI>di&s;clo&s;e his whole heart</HI> to the Viceroy, that they two had been plotting together; &s;o that had the Thou&s;and <HI>Portugue&s;es Athenateus</HI> wrote for &s;o earne&s;tly, come, it is more than probable that he would have made u&s;e of them for his own Service; the getting the Ports of <HI>Matzua</HI> and <HI>Arkiko</HI> into the hands of the <HI>Por|tugue&s;es,</HI> and the erecting of <HI>Tigre</HI> by their A&s;|&s;i&s;tance into a Kingdom Independent of that of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> being a thing the Fathers even when mo&s;t in favour with the Emperors, were continually labouring to bring about: For <HI>Athenateus</HI> was not only never in favour with the Emperor, who&s;e name he made u&s;e of in

<P>The new Viceroy of <HI>Gojam, Raz Cella</HI> ha|ving been quickly turned out of that Govern|ment, was &s;o enraged at this change in the Emperor's mind, that he was for depo&s;ing him pre&s;ently as an irreconcileable Enemy to their Religion, and for declaring the Prince, who was a hearty Friend to it, Emperor in his
<PB N="369" REF="197">room; and being encouraged &s;o to do, by the Monks and <HI>Alexandrians</HI> that were about him,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Viceroy of <HI>Gojam</HI> thereupon proclaims the Prince Emperor.</NOTE> he proclaimed the Prince <HI>Ba&s;ilides</HI> Em|peror of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> at the head of his Army; and having done it, di&s;patch'd a Courier to him to acquaint him therewith, and to de&s;ire him to join the Army he had the command of, with his, that they might be able to &s;ubdue all the Enemies of their Religion; but the Prince was &s;o far from being plea&s;ed with the Viceroy's having <HI>proclaimed him Emperor,</HI> that to &s;atisfy his Father of his having <HI>had no hand in it,</HI>

The Fathers, who&s;e Church of <HI>Collela</HI> was but at a &s;mall di|&s;tance from the Viceroy's Camp, were put in|to &s;uch a terrible fright by this Proclamation, that they immediately &s;hut their Gates; and their Convent being built very &s;trong, as in|deed all their Hou&s;es in <HI>Ethiopia</HI> were more like Ca&s;tles than Mona&s;teries; they re&s;olved to defend them&s;elves until an Army &s;hould come from the Emperor to relieve them.</P>
<P>The Viceroy hearing how much the Fathers were alarm'd, and of their having taken all the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> of the Neighbourhood into their Gari&s;on, he &s;ent them word, That they had no rea&s;on to be &s;o affrighted, for &s;eeing they did not come into <HI>Ethiopia</HI> before they were &s;ent for, no body could blame them for having come, or for what the Emperor had done &s;ince their Arrival; and being extreamly de&s;irous to have wheedled them out of their &s;trong-hold, he bid the Me&s;&s;enger whi&s;per
<PB N="370" REF="198">them in the Ear, That notwith&s;tanding all he had done, he was &s;till a true <HI>Roman</HI>-Catholick in his heart, having been forc'd to &s;et forth he late Proclamation, to quiet the Minds of the People if it were po&s;&s;ible; de&s;iring them likewi&s;e to &s;end him the Hor&s;es and Muskets that had been left in their Convent by <HI>Raz Cel|la:</HI> but the Fathers not believing a &s;yllable of what he &s;aid, refu&s;ed to open their Gates, or to deliver their Arms to the Me&s;&s;enger; which provoked the Viceroy to that degree, that he changed his note, and &s;ent them word, That <HI>if they did not deliver the Arms and Hor&s;es to him pre&s;ently, he would come for them him|&s;elf; and that if they did give him that trouble, he would be at a little more for to teach them bet|ter manners than to di&s;obey his Commands.</HI> And he had certainly been as good as his word, had he not been hindered by the news of a great Army advancing towards him a|pace.</P>
<P>The Monks, who were got in &s;hoals about the Viceroy, advi&s;ed him to do &s;omething to &s;atisfy the people, that he was in no Corre&s;|pondence with the Court, but was in earne&s;t to defend their Faith; adding, that there was no &s;uch way of doing that, as by making Exam|ples of &s;ome of tho&s;e, who to plea&s;e the Em|peror, had changed their Religion; the Vice|roy approving of their advice, commanded a Monk who was his own fir&s;t Cou&s;in, to be put to death publickly for having turned <HI>Ro|man</HI>-Catholick.</P>

The Emperor, who could not but take this extreamly well of the Prince, having examined the Viceroy and his Officers, commanded Seven of them to be pre&s;ently put to death, Six of which are &s;aid to have died <HI>Roman</HI>-Catholicks; which the Se|venth was &s;o far from doing, that when one of the Fathers told him at the place of Execu|tion, <HI>That he would be Damned for him if he were not Damned if he died out of the Communion of the</HI> Roman <HI>Church;</HI> he bid the Father <HI>look to him&s;elf, that he be not Damned upon his own account, for he was re&s;olved to venture his Soul with the</HI> Alexandrian <HI>Faith, by dying in it.</HI> Behold a Miracle, &s;ay the <HI>Je&s;uits;</HI> the Seven bodies being after they were Executed thrown to the Dogs, they all fell pre&s;ently upon the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> bo|dy, and eat it up bones and all, without &s;o much as offering to touch or &s;mell at any of the Six <HI>Roman</HI>-Catholicks bodies that lay be|fore them. One of the Viceroy's Chief Ser|vants continuing to rail again&s;t Popery, and the Emperor for forcing it upon his Subjects, was hanged by the thigh upon an Iron hook

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>SIR, <HI>I thought we had had the Victory in the la&s;t Fight, but I now begin to under&s;tand that we had the wor&s;t on't; for notwith&s;tanding in rea|lity the de&s;ign of the Rebels was to have taken your Crown from you, neverthele&s;s what they gave out was, that they fought only to have the Religion of their Fathers re&s;tored; &s;o that if they &s;hould gain that point, though they were beat, they may be reck|oned to have been Victorious; but as before the En|gagement was the proper time for the making of Vows and Promi&s;es, &s;o now is the time for fulfilling them. In order to Engage God to confer more &s;uch mer|cies upon you, who by this la&s;t Victory has as it were &s;et his &s;eal to all the former, and that for no other end but to oblige your Highne&s;s to advance his holy Faith, under the banner whereof you obtained it. Be&s;ides, it was the Catholicks that are in your Ar|my
<PB N="386" REF="206">that did the work, and who are not &s;o few as your Highne&s;s is told they are. The rea&s;on why they do not appear to be numerous, is becau&s;e they have no favour &s;hew'd them; whereas if your Highne&s;s would but be plea&s;ed to call them about your Per|&s;on, and be&s;tow all Offices of Honour and Tru&s;t up|on them, you would quickly &s;ee how they would mul|tiply, and how by that means both your Empire and the faith would flouri&s;h; whereas of late they have been kept from coming near you, none but Ser|pents having been admitted into your Councils;</HI> a whole Ne&s;t of which Serpents <HI>did on</HI> Friday <HI>la&s;t a&s;&s;emble together in the Hall of your Palace, where they treated no longer about the out-works of Religion, but laid the ax to the root, con&s;ulting to|gether how they might de&s;troy the Catholick Faith; which they agreed at la&s;t, to</HI> put to <HI>the Vote, by lea|ving the People and Soldiers to be of which Religion they like be&s;t; who whenever they are asked whe|ther they will have Chri&s;t or</HI> Barabbas, <HI>will certainly prefer</HI> Barabbas, <HI>for having been of their own Office and Profe&s;&s;ion. Sir, Matters of Faith are not to be treated in &s;uch a manner, but are to be &s;etled by Councils con&s;i&s;ting of great numbers of Bi&s;hops, where they may be had, or el&s;e of Grave and Learned Prie&s;ts and Friars: For though in Matters of State, the&s;e very men do not think fit to con&s;ult with every body, but only with per&s;ons of known Prudence and Experience;</HI> neverthele&s;s <HI>in Matters of Religion, the</HI> Otadores, Gauls, Mahometans <HI>and</HI> Heathens, <HI>are reckoned to be good Coun&s;ellors; and are all called in by them to determine which is the true, and which is the fal&s;e faith. I would have your Highne&s;s call to mind the many mercies God hath conferred on you &s;ince you
<PB N="387" REF="206">embraced the</HI> Roman <HI>Faith; and though it is true there have been many Rebellions, which is a Plague</HI> Ethiopia <HI>never was, nor never will be free from, until the Faith is deeply rooted therein; yet God has always been &s;o kind to you, as to lay the Rebels at your feet, and particularly in the la&s;t Fight, when your affairs were come to a cri&s;is;</HI> &s;o that <HI>your Arm is not &s;hortned, but extended. Remember likewi&s;e, that you did not for&s;ake the Faith of</HI> Ethiopia <HI>out of fear, the Fathers being in no condition to oblige you to do it by force of Arms, but you did it purely upon your being convinced of its fal&s;hood, and of the truth of that of</HI> Rome: <HI>Neither mu&s;t you forget, that I did not come to you of my own head, but was &s;ent by the</HI> Roman <HI>Pontiff, and your Brother the King of</HI> Portugal, <HI>upon your having writ to them &s;everal time to &s;end you a Patriarch and &s;ome Bi|&s;hops;</HI> in which affair if there <HI>was any delay, it was occa&s;ioned by the jealou&s;y they had of the fickle|ne&s;s of the</HI> Haba&s;&s;ins, <HI>which we now begin to ex|perience; and which the King of</HI> Portugal <HI>had for|merly had experience of when he &s;ent</HI> Don Chri|&s;topher De Gama <HI>hither with a &s;tout body of Troops, by whom this Empire was re&s;cued out of the hands of the</HI> Mahometans (who had Conquer'd it) <HI>and that not with an intention of keeping it to them&s;elves, but of re&s;toring it to your Ance&s;tors, as they did: Neither had the King of</HI> Portugal <HI>ever any other view, nor did he expect any other reward for what he did for you, but only your Friend&s;hip, and the union of this Empire with the</HI> Roman <HI>Church; to which end I and the Bi&s;hop that is here behind me were &s;ent by his Holine&s;s and his Maje&s;ty to you: Neither did we come among you as Beggars, but well &s;tored with Books, and Pontifical Ve&s;tments
<PB N="388" REF="207">and Ornaments, they not being willing to charge your Highne&s;s with &s;o much as the Maintenance of our per&s;ons.

Wherefore, that I may be able to give &s;ome account of my &s;elf to the world, I do in the name of God and Truth beg and re|quire it of your Highne&s;s, and of all your Nobles, That you would be plea&s;ed to let me have the rea&s;ons in writing why you have thought fit to bani&s;h me the Court; whether it be for my having preached any fal&s;e Doctrine, or for having been guilty of any &s;candalous Crime; or for not ha|ving punctually compli'd with the obligations of my Pa&s;toral function, or for having been In&s;olent in my words, or too rigorous in puni&s;hing, or for ha|ving been &s;lothful or carele&s;s, or for what other cau&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Your Highne&s;s may remember, that when your Father de&s;ired that his Subjects might be permitted
<PB N="403" REF="214">to return to &s;ome of their ancient cu&s;toms, that I gra|tify'd him fully in that matter; and that he happen|ing at the end of our Treaty, to mention &s;ome other customs that he had not &s;poke of before; I told him,</HI> That I was ready to yield to every thing that was not contrary to the Law of God, one thing only excepted, which was the giving the Cup to the Laicks; <HI>which, though not con|trary to the Law of God, the conce&s;&s;ion thereof be|ing re&s;erved to the chief</HI> Roman <HI>Pontiff, the Suc|ce&s;&s;or of St.</HI> Peter, <HI>and Chri&s;t's Vicar upon Earth, it was not in my power to grant it; I promi&s;ed ne|verthele&s;s, at the &s;ame time to write to his Holine&s;s about it, and to lay the whole matter before him with great &s;incerity, that &s;o he as a faithful and prudent Steward might Ordain what was most profitable. What I did then offer to your Father, I do now again offer to your Highne&s;s, and do declare, That if your Highne&s;s and your Empire will but continue in the Obedience of the</HI> Roman <HI>Church, the head of all Churches, and will but follow her faith, that I will grant you all that I can with a good Con&s;cience in the form afore&s;aid. Finally I do be&s;eech your High|ne&s;s before you &s;end me away, to a&s;&s;emble all your Learned men, to Treat and Di&s;pute with me about their doubts in Matters of Faith; for confiding in the Mercy of God and their good Judgments, I do not in the lea&s;t doubt but that I &s;hall be able to convince them of their being in &s;everal errors, and to oblige them to confe&s;s, that the Chair of St. Pe|tor is &s;uch, That</HI> the gates of hell can never prevail again&s;t it. <HI>This in my opinion would be the be&s;t cour&s;e you could take to quiet the minds of your people; for that if this &s;hould not be yielded to, what can the common people &s;ay, but that the

As to the bu&s;ine&s;s of your Religion, our Soul never entered into its Councils,
<PB N="407" REF="216">neither did we ever joyn with any Coun&s;ellors ei|ther to build it up, or de&s;troy it. We need not be told that the Emperor &s;ent for your Lord&s;hip, and that the Fathers likewi&s;e came with his Con&s;ent; as we need not, that ever &s;ince your coming he has been continually embroiled in Wars for endeavouring to e&s;tabli&s;h your Faith; Fighting &s;ometimes with his Sons, and at other times with his Slaves, whom he had rai&s;ed from the dunghil to great honours: In&s;omuch that from the fir&s;t hour we were able to bear Arms, we have never done any thing, but fight in obedience to our Father's Commands, which we al|ways obeyed. After the Battel I had in the begin|ning of this Winter with</HI> Ognadega, <HI>our Learned Monks and People having a&s;&s;embled them&s;elves together in the Camp, took the confidence to tell my Father their thoughts freely in the following words;</HI> Sir, How long are we to be plagued thus, and to tire our &s;elves about things that are good for nothing?

But whereas tho&s;e his Two Natures are not &s;eparated, his Divinity being United to the Fle&s;h, and not &s;eparated from it, and his Fle&s;h to the Divinity; we do not for that rea&s;on affirm them to be Two, but One; being made &s;o out of two Cau&s;es, and that not &s;o as to Confound and

<P>This Letter gives us a great deal of light into the Affairs of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> at this time. For Fir&s;t; We &s;ee plainly thereby, that Popery, as to its Per&s;ecuting &s;pirit, is the &s;ame in all Climates; it having no &s;ooner got the Power of the Government of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> on its &s;ide, than it made the penalty of not embracing it, the lo&s;s of E&s;tate, Liberty, and Life; and Herbs were reckoned too high a Diet, and Caves and De&s;arts too good a Dwelling for tho&s;e that left all, and fled to them, to pre&s;erve a good Con&s;cience. Secondly, That their denying the Cup in the Sacrament to the Laity, and the validity of the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Ordinations, and not their believing that there were Two Natures in Chri&s;t, were among the chief cau&s;es of the <HI>Haba&s;&s;ins</HI> having &s;uch an Aver&s;ion for Popery. La&s;tly, That Pope|ry owed all the footing that it ever had in <HI>Ethiopia</HI> to Violence; &s;o that it no &s;ooner lo&s;t the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Secular Arm, than it came to nothing.

<P><HI>In the Sixth place, I would have your Highne&s;s remember, that &s;everal of the Fathers of the Society who are Eminent for their Piety and Learning, have come into</HI> Ethiopia <HI>at divers times, not to &s;eek after Honours or Riches, but to &s;erve God and your people in much humility; and to teach them the true faith, &s;ome of them having given the greate&s;t Te&s;timonies of love that are po&s;&s;ible, in having laid down their Lives for their Friends; which Three of them did, one after having been &s;everal years a pri|&s;oner at</HI> Matzua, <HI>and the other two at</HI> Adel; <HI>and tho&s;e that are now alive have &s;erved your Father with all the fidelity of Doctors, Servants, and Slaves, as he him&s;elf has many times told me; all which notwith&s;tanding, after they had built &s;everal Churches and Hou&s;es, they are now turned out of them all; and that in the mid&s;t of Winter their Churches and Goods being all given to the Enemies of the</HI> Roman <HI>Faith; the Fathers that were at</HI> Gorgora <HI>having in little more than three Months time been &s;ent from three &s;everal places; they that were at</HI> Dembea <HI>and</HI> Gojam <HI>having been likewi&s;e turned out of all; notwith&s;tanding all which hard u&s;age, they continue to pray to God to E&s;tabli&s;h your Highne&s;s's Empire for ever; and that he would give you a Hou&s;e that has the true faith for its Foun|dation,

<PB N="440" REF="234">are Infidels,</HI> they reckon us Chri&s;tians; and <HI>though we are</HI> Fools, <HI>they reckon</HI> us Wi&s;e; <HI>on the contrary, if we give</HI> them but little, <HI>then let us be never</HI> &s;o Wi&s;e, <HI>we are reckoned</HI> Mad; <HI>and</HI> though Chri&s;tians, <HI>are reckoned</HI> Infidels; <HI>&s;o that it mu&s;t be</HI> our Pur&s;es, <HI>and not our</HI> Minds, <HI>that mu&s;t ju&s;tify us with</HI> this Nation, <HI>which boa&s;ts &s;o much of Politene&s;s and Ju&s;tice.

Neverthele&s;s we have the Law of our own great Prophet to &s;ave us, and which of all other Laws will do it the mo&s;t ef|fectually: Neither &s;hall I fail to take &s;evere Venge|ance on my &s;elf for having for&s;aken it for their Law, and that without &s;eeking to excu&s;e my &s;elf, by my having been converted by them at an age when I was not capable of under&s;tanding their Cheat, or of fore&s;eeing my own ruin thereby. But this I mu&s;t &s;ay in my own ju&s;tification, That I di&s;covered the error I had committed at the &s;ame time I came to the u&s;e of my rea&s;on; and retracted it in my heart, though till this day it was not po&s;&s;ible for me to do it publickly; but though I have been &s;low in doing it, I do hope the glorious atchievements of this day will abundantly compen&s;ate for that my &s;lowne&s;s, being confident that our mo&s;t ju&s;t Prophet will obtain a pardon for me from the &s;ublime</HI> Ala

<Q>Compo&s;ed by Father <HI>Lewis De Uuretta,</HI> a Dominican; and Print|ed at <HI>Valentia</HI> in the Year 1610.</Q>
<P>IN the Year 1316, Eight Dominican Friars, with a Holy Si&s;ter, <HI>Santer'd</HI> from <HI>Rome</HI> to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> where having Vi&s;ited the Holy Sepulcher, taking <HI>Bethlehem</HI> in their way, they went down into <HI>Egypt,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Ethiopia;</HI> and having there Learned the Language of the Countrey per|fectly in a few days, they begun to preach to the A&s;toni&s;hment of that whole Empire, con|firming the truth of all they taught by Miracles. Pre&s;ter <HI>John</HI> the Emperor hearing of tho&s;e wonderful Preachers, &s;ent to bid them welcome into his Empire, and to let them know they had free liberty to build Convents enough
<PB N="468" REF="250">therein to hold all <HI>Europe,</HI> and to exerci&s;e their power of <HI>Inqui&s;itors</HI> upon all his Subjects; and that he would allow them all the &s;ame Pri|vileges and Immunities that they enjoy in the <HI>Latin</HI> Church. The Fathers overjoy'd at this news, begun pre&s;ently to make u&s;e of the li|berty that was granted them; and having pe|netrated Six Hundred Leagues into <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> they came at la&s;t to the Lake of <HI>Cafates,</HI> on the other &s;ide of the <HI>Equinoctial,</HI> where the head of the River <HI>Nile</HI> ri&s;eth, where upon the Mountains of the Moon, and in the Kingdom of <HI>Gojam,</HI> and among the <HI>Caffres,</HI> and in the Provinces bordering on the Cape of <HI>Goodhope,</HI> they built &s;everal Convents, filling them all pre&s;ently with Friars of their own Order, mo&s;t of which came afterwards to be as famous for their Learning and Piety as they were for their Miracles; but the topping man of all tho&s;e Novices was one <HI>Tecla Haymonot,</HI> the only Child of King <HI>Saca&s;ab,</HI> and Queen <HI>Sarah;</HI> who having wrought divers Miracles in his Infan|cy, when he came to be a Man preferred the Dominican habit to a Crown, and came af|terwards to be the Chief Glory of his Order, having had the Honour done him, whenever he &s;aid <HI>Ma&s;s,</HI> to have the Wafer and the Wine brought down from Heaven to him by an Angel; and whenever he went to any City to Preach, he was con&s;tantly attended by all the Lyons, Tygers, Wolves, Snakes, and Ser|pents in the Neighbourhood, who never left him till he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them with the ble&s;&s;ing; for which they all expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves very thankful; and who having founded a Mo|na&s;tery
<PB N="469" REF="250">for <HI>Nine thou&s;and Dominican Friars,</HI> obliged <HI>the Devil</HI> to do all the &s;ervile work thereof for Seven Years; which he did alone &s;o exactly, that the Convent has never been &s;o well &s;erved &s;ince, which made an Emperor when he was told of it &s;ay, That <HI>Tecla Hamo|not was to blame, for not having made the Devil &s;erve the Convent as long as it &s;tood.</HI> While the Friars were thus employed, the <HI>Holy Si&s;ter</HI> was not idle, who as if &s;he had in|tended to have taken the Emperor at his word, built a Mona&s;tery, wherein &s;he placed Five Hundred Dominican <HI>Benta's</HI> of the third Rule. This great Nunnery was at fir&s;t called <HI>Bado Nagh,</HI> but at this time <HI>Santa Clara;</HI> the Hi&s;to|ry of all which Convents is to this day curi|ou&s;ly Painted in the Cloi&s;ters of the <HI>Plurima|nos,</HI> whither any, who are &s;o unrea&s;onable as to doubt of the truth of them, may go and be &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>The Mona&s;tery of <HI>Plurimanos,</HI> in which there are Nine thou&s;and Dominican Friars, was founded by <HI>Tecla Haymonot;</HI> It is four Leagues in Compa&s;s, and hath Eighty Dor|mitories, which have all the great Church at one end, and the Refectory at the other. Some of the&s;e Dormitories have One hundred and twenty, &s;ome One hundred and fifty, and &s;ome Two hundred Cells. Every Dormitory has a particular Chappel and Library belong|ing to it. The great Church is Six hundred paces long, and &s;o it had need, &s;ince all the Friars repair to it together on Sundays and Holidays. The Second great Dominican Con|vent in <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> is that of the <HI>Allelujah,</HI> which
<PB N="470" REF="251">was built by <HI>Bartholomew de Tiroli,</HI> a Domini|can Friar, who was Con&s;ecrated Bi&s;hop of the City of <HI>Dangola</HI> at <HI>Rome;</HI> it has but Se|ven thou&s;and Friars, who on high Days Dine all together in the Refectory.</P>
<P>From the&s;e two Convents, there are va&s;t numbers of Mi&s;&s;ionaries &s;ent once a year to <HI>Arabia, Bengala, Siam, Pegu</HI> and <HI>China;</HI> as al&s;o to <HI>Congo, Monopatata,</HI> and the Cape of <HI>Goodhope,</HI> by &s;ome of which Mi&s;&s;ionaries the King of <HI>Congo</HI> and <HI>Angola,</HI> was Baptized in the Year 1580. The&s;e Mi&s;&s;ionaries do all re|turn home at <HI>Whit&s;untide;</HI> and our Hi&s;torian being &s;en&s;ible that that was more than fle&s;h and blood could well do, very di&s;creetly prevents the objection, by telling us they came back nothing but Skin and Bone.</P>
<P>The&s;e two Mona&s;teries have been the greate&s;t Seminaries of Martyrs that have ever been in the world, above Three hundred thou&s;and of their Friars having &s;uffered Mar|tyrdom in &s;everal parts, which is more than any other Order be&s;ides the Dominicans can boa&s;t of. For in the Empre&s;s <HI>Helena</HI>'s time, who was her &s;elf a Dominican <HI>Beata,</HI> Eight hun|dred Friars of the <HI>Alelujah</HI> alone &s;uffered death in &s;everal Provinces for preaching the Go&s;pel; at which the good <HI>Beata</HI> was &s;o much trou|bled, that &s;he &s;ent to all the Mahometan and Heathen Merchants that were within her Empire, to let them know that they &s;hould Trade no longer in <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> if they did not take more care to pre&s;erve her Friars lives in their Mi&s;&s;ions.</P>
<PB N="471" REF="251">
<P>The Priors of the&s;e two Convents are by the Pope's Letter Con&s;tituted the <HI>chief Inqui|tors</HI> of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> where the <HI>Inqui&s;ition</HI> is more rigorous than in <HI>Spain;</HI> for it relaxeth all Hereticks and Apo&s;tates to the Secular Arm for their fir&s;t fault, though never &s;o penitent; who being relaxed, are always thrown, without mercy, to the Lyons.</P>
<P>But the wonder of the world is the Empe|ror's Library founded by Queen <HI>Saba,</HI> upon the Mountain of <HI>Amara,</HI> where the Convent of the <HI>holy Cro&s;s</HI> &s;tands; its Foundre&s;s hand-&s;elled it with <HI>Solomon</HI>'s own Works, and the other Books he Pre&s;ented her withal, among which are the Books of <HI>Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Job,</HI> &amp;c. And the Emperors have been ever &s;ince buying all the Books they could hear of to put into it; &s;o that at pre&s;ent it contains above a Million of Books all very fairly writ|ten, and richly Bound, an hundred and Thir|teen thou&s;and of which are <HI>Hebrew</HI> and <HI>Ara|bick:</HI> Neither is there any Book who&s;e lo&s;s is bewailed here in <HI>Europe,</HI> but what is to be met with there; of which <HI>Gregory</HI> the Thir|teenth being informed, he &s;ent <HI>Antonio Grico</HI> and <HI>Lorenco Cremones</HI> into <HI>Ethiopia</HI> to &s;ee whe|ther that Library was &s;o great and rich as it was reported to be; who having &s;een it, found it much greater than Fame had made it; and returning home, brought the <HI>Talmud</HI> and <HI>Cabala</HI> with them to compare them with tho&s;e the <HI>Jews</HI> of <HI>Italy</HI> had in their hands. It is not very well &s;tored with <HI>Latin</HI> Eccle&s;ia|&s;tical Authors, having none of the Ancients, be&s;ide St. <HI>Hierom</HI> and Saint <HI>Ambro&s;e,</HI> tran&s;lated
