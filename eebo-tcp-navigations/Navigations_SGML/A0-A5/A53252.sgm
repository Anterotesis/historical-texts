<HEAD>A
PREFACE
To the following
NARRATIVE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Courteous Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DO readily agree with thee, that there
is no &s;ort of Writings more lyable to
abu&s;e than this of the <HI>Narrative:</HI> Ly|ing
much at the Mercy of the <HI>Compo|&s;er</HI>
to be Corrupted; and as much in dan|ger
to be mi&s;-improved by the <HI>Reader:</HI> The
<HI>Reader</HI> therefore I am &s;ure will demand good
<HI>Security</HI> that he is not impo&s;ed upon in the
en&s;uing <HI>Relation,</HI> and the <HI>Writer</HI> craves leave
too, to maintain <HI>a mode&s;t Jealou&s;ie,</HI> le&s;t the
<HI>Reader</HI> &s;hould mi&s;s the benefit that is de&s;ign|ed
to him in it: The <HI>Author</HI> will engage,
and pawn his Credit <HI>not to wrong the Narra|tive,</HI>
and he would take &s;ome care al&s;o that
the <HI>Reader</HI> may <HI>not wrong him&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>It is very true, that <HI>every Narrator</HI> is un|der
a &s;trong Temptation to <HI>Sea&s;on</HI> his Di&s;|cour&s;e
to the <HI>Gu&s;to</HI> of the Time, not impo|&s;ing
<PB REF="6">
a &s;evere Law upon him&s;elf, to <HI>Report</HI>
what is true, but accomodating his Story to
the Liquori&s;h Appetite of others: I have ob|&s;erved
that <HI>&s;ome Men</HI> are a&s;hamed to <HI>Recount
mean and humble Matters;</HI> if they bring us
any thing below <HI>Prodigy and Miracle;</HI> if they
&s;tuff not their Farces with <HI>Gorgons, Harpies,
Centaures, and Enchanted I&s;lands,</HI> they nei|ther
plea&s;e them&s;elves, nor hope to take their
<HI>Readers</HI> by the <HI>Heart-&s;trings.</HI> Hence it is,
that we have &s;o many lean, barren <HI>Stories,</HI>
larded with the Additaments of Fruitful In|vention,
as if they had been Penn'd by the
Pattern of <HI>Xenophon's Cyrus. Non ad Hi&s;toriae
fidem, &s;ed ad ju&s;ti Imperii Exemplar:</HI> Not
for <HI>Counter-panes of Truth,</HI> but <HI>Counterfeits
of Fancy:</HI> They tell us not what was <HI>really
done,</HI> but what they <HI>would have had done,</HI> if
they might have had the Contrivance of <HI>the
Scene and Tragedy:</HI> They fir&s;t form <HI>Idaea's</HI>
of <HI>Ingenious Romances</HI> in their own Heads,
and then obtrude them upon the World for
<HI>Hi&s;torical Verieties.</HI></P>
<P>Ju&s;t as our <HI>Hydrographers</HI> in the Delineat|ing
of <HI>Countries,</HI> with one wanton <HI>Extrava|gant
Frolick</HI> of their <HI>Graver</HI> can rai&s;e <HI>Moun|tains,</HI>
where Nature left us <HI>Vallies;</HI> and &s;ink
<HI>deep Vallies,</HI> where God has &s;tretch'd out a
<HI>Champagn;</HI> can create <HI>Bays, and Creeks,</HI>
where the <HI>Creator</HI> made <HI>firm Land;</HI> and jut
out <HI>Promontories, and Capes,</HI> where there's
<PB REF="6">
nothing in <HI>Nature</HI> to an&s;wer them; and to
fill up <HI>Vacuities</HI> (out of pure good <HI>Husband|ry,</HI>
that not an inch of <HI>Ground</HI> may be lo&s;t)
pre&s;ent us with <HI>Flying Fi&s;hes, Tritons,</HI> and
<HI>Mermaids,</HI> which &s;pend their hours <HI>inter Pe|ctinem
&amp; Speculum;</HI> and le&s;t <HI>Mare del zur</HI>
&s;hould &s;till be a De&s;olate Wilderne&s;s, have
courteou&s;ly &s;tock'd it with <HI>the Painter's
Wifes I&s;land,</HI> and <HI>Terra Incognita;</HI> at this
rate are we dealt with, by this kind of Men,
who love to blow up <HI>lank &s;ttories</HI> into huge
<HI>Bladders,</HI> and then put &s;omething in them to
make them <HI>Rattle</HI> to plea&s;e <HI>Children,</HI> and
yet they are <HI>but Bladders &s;till,</HI> though &s;wel|led
with the <HI>Tympany,</HI> and <HI>Wind-Cholick.</HI></P>
<P>There are al&s;o a &s;ort of <HI>Stories,</HI> which, <HI>by
the way of Courte&s;ie,</HI> we mi&s;-call <HI>Hi&s;tories,</HI>
that &s;corn to give us an account of any thing
but <HI>dreadful, and terrible Battels,</HI> and how
one great Man above all the re&s;t, chopt off
<HI>Heads</HI> and <HI>Arms,</HI> and cut off &s;ome &s;heer by
the <HI>Wa&s;te,</HI> and with his <HI>Trenchant-blade</HI> mow|ed
down <HI>whole Files of Armed Enemies;</HI> the
Fields all this while running with &s;treams of
Blood, and purple Gore; and all this, with
as much confidence, and exactne&s;s in every
<HI>Minute Circum&s;tance,</HI> as if, like the Familiar
<HI>Daemon</HI> of <HI>Paracel&s;us,</HI> they had been inclo|&s;ed
in <HI>the pommel</HI> of the <HI>General's Sword;</HI> or
had hover'd, like <HI>Victory with her doubtful
Wings,</HI> over both the <HI>Armies,</HI> where they
<PB REF="7">
might &s;ecurely take notes of all that was <HI>&s;aid</HI>
or <HI>done,</HI> in <HI>Shelton</HI>'s <HI>Brachygraphy:</HI> but from
what <HI>Principles</HI> or <HI>Intere&s;ts</HI> the&s;e <HI>Warriers</HI>
were <HI>Acted;</HI> by what <HI>Rules</HI> they <HI>proceeded,</HI>
with what <HI>Councels</HI> and <HI>Intrigues,</HI> de&s;igns
were <HI>managed;</HI> and to what <HI>Point</HI> all the&s;e
<HI>Policies &s;teered;</HI> is as much <HI>below their Spirits</HI>
as <HI>above their Abilities,</HI> to inform us.</P>
<P>To &s;ecure the <HI>Reader</HI> again&s;t the fear of
&s;uch Entertainment in this <HI>Narrative,</HI> let
him know, that he &s;hall meet with nothing
<HI>in Fact</HI> but what is <HI>preci&s;ely true;</HI> what of
<HI>wonderment</HI> he may Encounter, was of <HI>God's
own working,</HI> not of <HI>Man's inventing;</HI> let others
make <HI>Tragedies</HI> to gratifie the <HI>Book-&s;eller,</HI> and
cheat the &s;imple <HI>Buyer;</HI> we need not <HI>Peter

<HI>Greater Mon&s;ters,</HI> to <HI>Aggrandize</HI> our
<HI>Title Page;</HI> God's Works need no <HI>foyl</HI> to &s;et
them off, the greate&s;t <HI>Beauty of Truth,</HI> is its
<HI>nakedne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Symmetry.</HI></P>
<P>There is a va&s;t difference <HI>between</HI> the <HI>mo&s;t
elaborate products</HI> of <HI>Art,</HI> and the mo&s;t <HI>homely
pieces of Nature;</HI> for though <HI>the former</HI> will
needs <HI>Ape</HI> the <HI>latter,</HI> yet how pitifully does
<HI>&s;he bungle in the imitation!</HI> Look upon <HI>the
&s;ubtle Point of the fine&s;t Needle</HI> through a
<HI>Micro&s;cope,</HI> and you will &s;oon be &s;atisfied
that <HI>Art is but a Dunce,</HI> for the <HI>Needle</HI> will
appear as <HI>blunt, and dull</HI> as a <HI>Drum-&s;tick;</HI> but
come and view one of Gods Handy-works in
<PB REF="7">
the &s;ame Gla&s;s, <HI>V. G. The &s;ting of a Bee,</HI> and
you &s;hall &s;ee it perpetually Acuminated till
it ends in <HI>&s;omething,</HI> which the Eye mu&s;t
either confe&s;s to be a <HI>Point,</HI> or <HI>Nothing;</HI> The
&s;ame difference we may ob&s;erve between
tho&s;e <HI>Romances,</HI> which are the <HI>I&s;&s;ues</HI> of <HI>fine
Wits,</HI> and the <HI>&s;erious, grave Contrivances</HI> of
<HI>Divine Providence;</HI> what <HI>clumz'd things</HI>
are the <HI>Ca&s;&s;andra's</HI> to one of tho&s;e <HI>pieces of
proportion,</HI> to be &s;een in <HI>God's Government of
this lower World!</HI> So that it were <HI>unpardonable</HI>
to &s;trive <HI>to Recommend</HI> the wonderful Provi|dences
of God to the <HI>Genius</HI> of this <HI>Age, by
a Lye,</HI> or to <HI>talk deceitfully for him;</HI> what|ever
therefore this <HI>Narrative</HI> is, yet it's a <HI>na|ked
Account of his own workings; and Gold
needs no Gilding.</HI></P>
<P>But now the <HI>Readers great danger</HI> lies in
running over &s;ome of <HI>God's Works,</HI> and yet
not &s;eeing <HI>God in his Works:</HI> Little Chil|dren,
we &s;ee, do hugely plea&s;e them&s;elves
with the <HI>Gilded Covers,</HI> and <HI>Marbled Leaves</HI>
of Books, but concern not them&s;elves, <HI>what
is within;</HI> and if they chance to look a little
overly upon <HI>the forms and &s;hapes of the Let|ters,</HI>
yet under&s;tand not the <HI>&s;ublime matter,</HI>
that may be coucht in them: Now, to divide
<HI>the words</HI> from <HI>the meaning,</HI> is morally to
<HI>Annihilate</HI> them, and &s;o whil&s;t they &s;ee <HI>Let|ters,</HI>
and <HI>Words</HI> only, they &s;ee ju&s;t <HI>Nothing:</HI>
There are a great many &s;uch <GAP DESC="foreign">,
<PB REF="8">
&s;uch <HI>Old Children</HI> in the World, that gaze
upon <HI>the &s;urface of Gods Works,</HI> but never
are led <HI>by them</HI> to admire <HI>the Wi&s;dom, Pow|er,
Goodne&s;s, and Holine&s;s</HI> of God: They
deal with <HI>the Works of Providence,</HI> ju&s;t as
they do with <HI>the Works of Creation:</HI> God
has Ingraven <HI>his own Name</HI> in Legible Cha|racters
upon <HI>the Heavenly Bodies.</HI> The Stars
in their <HI>&s;ingle Beauties,</HI> their <HI>Combined A&s;te|ri&s;ms,</HI>
their <HI>Mutual A&s;pects,</HI> their <HI>Intricate,</HI>
yet <HI>Regular Motions,</HI> &s;peak their <HI>Author;</HI>
nay, upon the lowe&s;t <HI>Recreations,</HI> the <HI>Lei|&s;ure-&s;ports</HI>
of <HI>Nature,</HI> there is written, <HI>Deus
fecit.</HI> But now the common ob&s;erver,

and his <HI>Eye</HI> with the <HI>vi&s;ible Heavens,</HI> as 'tis
be&s;pangled with glittering things, called

&s;hould confe&s;s it, could we but hear them
Sing this <HI>Antheme, Glory be to God on High.</HI>
Can we be &s;o Bruiti&s;h, as once to imagine,
that the wi&s;e God, who creates <HI>nothing little,</HI>
nor for a <HI>little end,</HI> &s;hould create &s;uch <HI>great,
and glorious Bodies</HI> only <HI>to</HI> be <HI>the Objects</HI> of
<HI>Ignorant,</HI> and <HI>Blind Amazement?</HI> Surely
no; <HI>but that</HI> by <HI>the contemplation of them,</HI>

<PB REF="8">
who&s;e Being, Wi&s;dom, Power mu&s;t needs

&s;o ra&s;h, and praecipitous?</HI> And &s;hall determine
it again&s;t us, that we <HI>tempted God</HI> by ca&s;ting
<HI>our &s;elves upon extraordinary Protection,</HI> expect|ing
deliverance without warrant, <HI>in a way little
on this &s;ide miracle:</HI> I &s;hall fir&s;t &s;ay, Let him &s;hun
<HI>that Rock</HI> in his own Conver&s;ation, upon <HI>which
he &s;uppo&s;es us to have da&s;ht:</HI> Let our <HI>Ship-wrack</HI>
be a <HI>Buoy</HI> to warn him of <HI>the</HI> like <HI>pre&s;umption,</HI>
and let him learn more <HI>wi&s;dom,</HI> at our <HI>co&s;t</HI> and
<HI>charges.</HI> I &s;hall further &s;ay, let him not di&s;co|ver
greater ra&s;hne&s;s in cen&s;uring our <HI>Adventure,</HI>
then he charges upon our <HI>Adventure,</HI> but
mode&s;tly con&s;ider <HI>him&s;elf, le&s;t he al&s;o be
tempted:</HI> and if we were <HI>guilty of folly,</HI> he may
<HI>thus gain wi&s;dom</HI> by our <HI>folly.</HI> But I &s;hall add,
<HI>Extremity of Mi&s;ery is none of the be&s;t Coun&s;ellers;</HI>
let him put him&s;elf under our Circum&s;tances,
and if Cowardi&s;e did not hinder him from ma|king
our Attempt, I am confident Con&s;cience
would not: Our Lives were bitter <HI>to us by Rea|&s;on
of cruel Bondage,</HI> and <HI>(though mine was at that
time much mitigated)</HI> yet there is a <HI>&s;ecret Mag|neti&s;me</HI>
in a <HI>Native Soil,</HI> with which our <HI>Hearts
being once &s;trongly toucht,</HI> could never admit of
<HI>the leact variation,</HI> but &s;till pointed directly

<HI>in&s;tructed never to promi&s;e them &s;elves great mat|ters

cour&s;e of our <HI>Captivity,</HI> and con&s;tant Tenour
of <HI>tho&s;e Gracious Providences which brought us
thence,</HI> and the <HI>Series of Mercy, Wi&s;dom,</HI> and
<HI>Power, that was our Convoy Home,</HI> that we ever
found mo&s;t of Favour from God, when we ex|pected
lea&s;t from Men: <HI>and the least of kind|ne&s;s</HI>
from tho&s;e where <HI>we might,</HI> or <HI>thought we
might</HI> in Rea&s;on have promi&s;ed our &s;elves
mo&s;t. When we <HI>met with unexpected Friend|&s;hip,
<PB REF="15">
God would teach us to own him&s;elf.</HI> When
we met with <HI>di&s;-appointment,</HI> God would teach
us <HI>the folly of Idolizing the Creature:</HI> I have &s;e|riou&s;ly
admired the <HI>Compa&s;&s;ion and Relief we
found at Mayork,</HI> and yet we knew them to be
<HI>Romani&s;ts,</HI> and they knew us to be <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI>
and <HI>haw little re&s;pect</HI> we found <HI>frome &s;ome of our
own Countrey,</HI> at <HI>Alicant, Cadiz,</HI> and St. <HI>Lucars,</HI>
and yet we were tyed together in the &s;tricte&s;t
<HI>Triple Bonds</HI> of <HI>&V;n Dieu, &V;n Roy, &V;n Ley, One
God, One King, One Law:</HI> But God was &s;een in
both. I could Relate a Pa&s;&s;age during our
<HI>Captivity</HI> in <HI>Algiers,</HI> that had more of bitter|ne&s;s
in it, than in all our Slavery; and yet
they were <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> not <HI>Algerines; Prote&s;tants,</HI>
not <HI>Papists; Engli&s;h-men,</HI> not <HI>Strangers,</HI> that
were the cau&s;e of it: But I have put a force
upon my &s;elf, and am re&s;olved not to publi&s;h
it. In our Return homewards, we met with
&s;ome <HI>who would talk to the grief of tho&s;e whom
God had wounded, and was now in a way to heal
again.</HI> Some would interpretatively &s;ay, with
the Churli&s;h <HI>Nabal,</HI> 1 Sam. 25. 10. Who are
the&s;e? And whence come they? <HI>There are ma|ny
Servants now adays that break away, every one
from his Ma&s;ter.</HI> But then was the &s;ea&s;on when
we had mo&s;t Experience of Gods faithfulne&s;s:
And I &s;hall never cea&s;e to own before the World
the great Re&s;pect we found from &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Merchants, to whom we were perfect Stran|gers;
and the Civilities of Captain <HI>Good&s;on,</HI>
<PB REF="16">
Captain <HI>Smith,</HI> his <HI>Mate,</HI> and his <HI>Son,</HI> are not
to be forgotten.</P>
<P><HI>Perhaps, after all this, the</HI> Reader <HI>will be</HI>
earnest to be &s;atisfied, <HI>why this</HI> Narrative <HI>has</HI>
lain &s;o long Dormant, and appeared no &s;ooner in
the World? <HI>And I &s;hall herein al&s;o endeavour</HI>
to give him all Rea&s;onable &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>1. <HI>When we return'd into</HI> England, <HI>we
found our Native Country</HI> embroyled in a Civil
War, <HI>and mo&s;t Men had enough to do,</HI> to bear
their own per&s;onal Calamities, <HI>and had little
need to be troubled with</HI> the mi&s;eries of others;
they were other kind of Declarations that flew a|broad
then, and that was enough to &s;uper-&s;ede a
Narrative of this Nature, for &s;ome Years.</P>
<P>2. The <HI>great Mercies of God</HI> have not al|waies
<HI>their due weight</HI> upon our Hearts <HI>at first;</HI>
and I have received <HI>&s;ignal Deliverances</HI> from
eminent dangers <HI>&s;ince that great one;</HI> and it's
well if all the mercies of our Lives, all our De|liverances
put together, will <HI>amount to an Ar|gument
&s;trong enough to overcome our backwardne&s;s
to make publick acknowledgments.</HI></P>
<P>3. I thought a long while that <HI>it was not worth
the while,</HI> to trouble the World <HI>with my parti|cular
Concerns,</HI> till the <HI>Importunity of &s;everal Mi|nisters,
and others,</HI> both in City and Country,
overcame my reluctancy, in who&s;e Rea&s;ons I
did acquie&s;ce.</P>
<P>4. I was con&s;cious to my &s;elf <HI>of great unfit|ne&s;s</HI>
to recommend <HI>it to publick view,</HI> in &s;uch a
<PB REF="16">
garb as might <HI>vindicate it from Contempt;</HI> for
though it has been drawn out many years <HI>with
my own hand,</HI> and many have had the <HI>peru&s;al
of it, have approved it, and de&s;ired it;</HI> yet till I
could prevail with a Friend to teach it <HI>to &s;peak a
little better Engli&s;h,</HI> I could not be per&s;waded
<HI>to let it walk abroad; The Stuff and Matter is
my own, the Trimming and Form is anothers,</HI> for
whom I mu&s;t vouch, that he has done the
<HI>Truth, my &s;elf, and the Reader Ju&s;tice.</HI></P>
<P>Having overcome all the&s;e difficulties, <HI>I do
here Erect my Ebenezer, as a &s;mall Monument of
great Mercy,</HI> and as an <HI>Obligation</HI> upon my <HI>Soul</HI>
to great Duty, and do pray that it may &s;tand as
an <HI>Abiding Witne&s;s</HI> for God in my <HI>Con&s;cience;</HI>
that when-ever I am tempted to Sin, I may
have an An&s;wer ready to &s;top the Mouth of the
<HI>Tempter</HI> with <HI>Indignation; How can I do this
great Evil, and Sin again&s;t my good God?</HI> When
I am tempted to di&s;tru&s;t, I may encourage my
<HI>Faith</HI> from my own <HI>Narrative,</HI> &s;aying, <HI>Remem|ber
that God who delivered thee at Sea;</HI> when I
am tempted to murmur, I may &s;uppre&s;s tho&s;e
mutinous thoughts from my own <HI>Narrative,</HI>
&s;aying, <HI>Remember what thou endure&s;t in Algiers.</HI>
When my Heart grows cold, and unthankful,
I may chide, and &s;hame it, from my own
<HI>Narrative,</HI> into gratitude to God; <HI>That God,
who remembred us in our low E&s;tate, for his Mer|cy
endureth for ever!</HI> who pre&s;erved us <HI>at the
Sea,</HI> the <HI>Great Sea; for his Mercy endureth for
<PB REF="17">
ever!</HI> and &s;ecured us in a <HI>Boat,</HI> a <HI>Contemptible
Boat, for his Mercy endureth for ever!</HI> who gave
us favour in the Eyes of <HI>Strangers, for his Mer|cy
endureth for ever!</HI> and opened to us the Hearts
of <HI>Enemies; for his Mercy endureth for ever!</HI>
and taught us to look up to his never failing
Mercy, when Friends failed, <HI>for his Mercy en|dureth
for ever!</HI> who turned us &s;afe to <HI>England,</HI>
for <HI>his mercy endureth for ever!</HI> we called up|on
him <HI>in the day of Trouble, he delivered us, and
we will glorifie him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reader,</HI> this <HI>Narrative</HI> is true, peru&s;e it &s;eri|ou&s;ly,
and let not Vanity tempt thee to &s;ay,
<HI>Things might have been better contrived, wi&s;elier

in <HI>All;</HI> call not his Wi&s;dom in Que&s;tion, be|cau&s;e
he did not create more wonders to grati|fie
thy itching Humour; perhaps thou would&s;t
have had us been brought over upon a <HI>Floating
I&s;land,</HI> or in a <HI>Whales Belly,</HI> but I do not under|&s;tand
that the great God is bound to work Mi|racles
to &s;ave Mens longings: God has done
his work well, and none can mend it; for,
<HI>what can the Man do that comes after the King?</HI>
Eccl. 2. 12. <HI>For the matter of Fact</HI> Recorded
herein, <HI>I might &s;afely call God to Record upon my
Soul that I lye not:</HI> The thing is known to ma|ny,
and has been &s;ifted, and &s;cann'd by &s;uch
Eyes and Ears as are not guilty of ea&s;ie Credu|lity;
I have Evidence that may &s;torm the mo&s;t
ob&s;tinate unbelief: Mr. <HI>Thomas Saunders,</HI> my
<PB REF="17">
Wife's Brother, being in <HI>Mayork</HI> not long af|ter
we came from thence, &s;aw our <HI>Boat</HI> hang
up <HI>for a Monument</HI> upon the &s;ide of <HI>the great
Churh there.</HI> Mr. <HI>Robert Hales,</HI> who was there
1671. a&s;&s;ures me he &s;aw the naked Ribs and
Skeleton of it then hanging in the &s;ame place.
Now, I a&s;&s;ure thee, <HI>Reader,</HI> I &s;hould be much
a&s;hamed of my &s;elf, if Strangers unconcerned
in my <HI>Per&s;onal Deliverances,</HI> &s;hould be <HI>&s;o far
concerned</HI> as to pre&s;erve a <HI>Memorial</HI> of them,
and yet unthankful I &s;hould Erect no <HI>Standard</HI>
or <HI>Piller</HI> as an Evidence of Gods wonderful
appearing for me.</P>
<P>It's true, I am informed by <HI>one, that &s;ome af|firm,</HI>
there are more <HI>Boats hanging up in Ma|york,
in Memory of &s;ome &s;uch like e&s;cape:</HI> Now,
if others have really e&s;caped the &s;ame danger,
by the &s;ame means, it greatly confirms our
<HI>Narrative;</HI> and I do heartily rejoyce, <HI>Provi|dence
has appeared in the &s;ame Method for others,
as for our &s;elves:</HI> we never intend to <HI>Monopo|lize</HI>
Gods Providences to <HI>our &s;ole u&s;e and be|hoof;</HI>
and we rejoyce if our attempt and &s;uc|ce&s;s
may have encouraged others to make <HI>the
like attempt,</HI> and have found the like &s;ucce&s;s;
but I do a&s;&s;ert it with great confidence, that
when we were in <HI>Mayork,</HI> there was no &s;uch
<HI>Boat hanging up,</HI> but the Inhabitants there en|tertained
our Deliverance as &s;uch whereof they
had no parallel: But if on the other &s;ide, the&s;e,
or &s;ome of the&s;e &s;ucceeding <HI>Boats</HI> were but <HI>Im|po&s;ture,</HI>
<PB REF="18">
then the goodne&s;s of God appears <HI>more
remarkable</HI> towards us, that we really were the
Subjects of &s;uch wonder <HI>which others</HI> dur&s;t <HI>on|ly
pretend to;</HI> and it &s;ets a lu&s;tre upon this <HI>great
Salvation,</HI> which others have thought <HI>&s;o con&s;i|derable,</HI>
that they judged it worth the while to
<HI>tell a Lye</HI> to entitle them&s;elves <HI>to the Credit of
it;</HI> for <HI>it's Gold and Silver, not Copper, or ba&s;er
Metals,</HI> that they who drive the Coyning
Trade, &s;trive to Counterfeit.</P>
<P><HI>Let then every one that reads, under&s;tand,</HI> and
&s;eriou&s;ly &s;it down, and con&s;ider with him&s;elf,
whether he has not had <HI>many eminent Per&s;onal
Deliverances</HI> in one kind or other, which this
Marvellous Providence of God towards us may
not refre&s;h his Memory withal; and if he &s;hall
hence be taught to blu&s;h at his forgetfulne&s;s of
lap&s;ed Mercies; if this <HI>Narrative</HI> &s;hall recover
any lo&s;t Providencies, and fix them on, and ri|vet
into his Soul; if he &s;hall find him&s;elf
awakened to do thankfulne&s;s to God for all his
benefits towards him; let him joyn with me in
a&s;cribing <HI>all the Power,</HI> and therefore <HI>all the
Glory,</HI> to the Almighty, and let him kindly ac|cept
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of him, who &s;hall reckon it
among&s;t his other Mercies, to have been Ser|viceable
to any one in reviving a better frame

<P>In the Month of <HI>June,</HI> in the Year of Our
Lord, One Thou&s;and, Six Hundred, Thirty,
and Nine, in pur&s;uance of a Commi&s;&s;ion from
the Right Honourable, the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI>
the Lord <HI>Say,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Brook,</HI> we took Ship
at <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> in the <HI>Mary</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> carrying
Six Guns, Mr. <HI>Boarder</HI> being Ma&s;ter, and <HI>James

in her, Seamen and Pa&s;&s;engers, above
Sixty, bound for the <HI>I&s;le of Providence</HI> in the
<HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI> Five Weeks we lay in the <HI>Downs,</HI>
wi&s;hing, and waiting for a Wind, and then we
&s;et Sail, and came to Anchor near the <HI>I&s;le of
Wight;</HI> but by this time all our Beer in the Ship
&s;tunk, and we were forced to throw it over|board,
and to take in Vinegar to mix with
Water for our Voyage. The next Lord's
Day we &s;et Sail again, and coming between
the I&s;land, and the Main Land, we &s;tuck fa&s;t
in the Sands, but the Tide coming in, hove us
off. The&s;e Circum&s;tances &s;eem very incon&s;i|derable

were in the Womb of <HI>the&s;e little things.</HI> Had
the Wind &s;tood longer again&s;t us, it had been
more for us, and the danger had been pa&s;t;
had it &s;tood le&s;s while again&s;t us, it had been
for us too, and we had been gone pa&s;t the dan|ger:
But God appoints it the Moment when it
&s;hould come about to blow us into the Mouths
of our Enemies: We &s;ee the Truth of that,
<HI>Ye know what to pray for:</HI> We prayed for a
<HI>Wind,</HI> and we had a <HI>Whirl-wind:</HI> If we alwaies
knew what mi&s;chief the An&s;wer of our Prayers
would do us, we &s;hould be glad to eat our
words, and Pray again&s;t our Prayers. Denyal
is often the be&s;t An&s;wer, and we had need leave
all Petitions to the wi&s;dom of God to be Inter|preted,
according to his good plea&s;ure, and re|turned
as they may be good for us, and make
mo&s;t for his own Glory: we were al&s;o taught,
that the Sea may &s;ometimes be our be&s;t
Friend, and the Earth our wor&s;t Enemy; and
that <HI>nothing can do us good or hurt, but by the
Direction and Commi&s;&s;ion of the Almighty.</HI></P>
<P>We were now three Ships in Company, and
one of the other I remember, carried Nine
Guns, Mr. <HI>Church,</HI> Ma&s;ter. The Sixth Day
after our &s;etting Sail from the <HI>I&s;le of Wight,</HI> by

three Ships about three or four Leagues to <HI>Lee|ward:</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="20">

not long <HI>before we di&s;covered tho&s;e other three

there was no way to e&s;cape, then we mu&s;ts <HI>needs</HI>

whil&s;t their other two attended the remaining
two of our Company till the Morning. At

&s;hort Di&s;pute Boarded us, <HI>and took us all three:</HI>
In the <HI>Mary,</HI> &s;ix were &s;lain, and many wound|ed;

<P>As &s;oon as we were a&s;hore, for the fir&s;t Night
we were lock'd down in a deep na&s;ty <HI>Cellar;</HI>
&s;ome inconveniences we felt, but they were no|thing
to what we feared: The next day we

the Cu&s;tom, and his own Right, is to have
the Tenth Man for his Dividend of the <HI>Slaves.</HI></P>
<P>When the next <HI>Market-day</HI> came; we were

and there is a great deal of God's goodne&s;s in
that <HI>one word,</HI> that it was not to the <HI>Slaughter-hou&s;e

be Sold.</HI> Their Cruelty is great, but their
<HI>Covetou&s;ne&s;s</HI> exceeds their <HI>Cruelty;</HI> could they
make as much of us Dead, as they make alive,
that &s;o both the Intere&s;ts of <HI>Cruelty,</HI> and of <HI>Co|vetou&s;ne&s;s,</HI>
might be &s;ecured, and reconciled,
we were well a&s;&s;ured which way it &s;hould have

<HI>Tallow</HI> and <HI>Fat,</HI> that will an&s;wer two or three

<P>Their manner of &s;elling <HI>Slaves,</HI> is this. They
lead them up and down the <HI>Fair,</HI> or <HI>Market;</HI>
and when a Chapman bids any Money, they
pre&s;ently cry, <HI>a-Rache! a-Rache!</HI> that is,
<HI>Here's &s;o much Money bidden, who bids more?</HI>
They that cheapen the expo&s;ed <HI>Slaves</HI> are ve|ry
<HI>circum&s;pect per&s;ons, they carry their Eyes in
their Heads, as well as their Money in their Pur&s;es,</HI>
and u&s;e the one in laying out the other; for
they <HI>are loath to buy a Pig in a Poke;</HI> their fir&s;t
Policy is to <HI>look in their Mouths;</HI> and a good,
&s;trong, entire &s;et of <HI>Grinders</HI> will advance the
Price con&s;iderably, and they have good Rea|&s;on
for this Practice: for fir&s;t, <HI>they are Rational
Creatures,</HI> and know, <HI>that they who have not
Teeth, cannot eat, cannot work;</HI> and they <HI>that
cannot work, are not for their turn; and they
that are not for their turn, are not for their
<PB N="10" REF="23">
Money.</HI> And Secondly, they intend to keep
them at hard meat all the Year, and it mu&s;t
not be <HI>Gums,</HI> but &s;olid <HI>Teeth</HI> (nay, if it were
<HI>po&s;&s;ible, ca&s;e-hardn'd Teeth)</HI> that <HI>mu&s;t chew it;</HI>
and when all is done, they had need of the

<HI>is to feel their Limbs;</HI> as whether there be
any <HI>Fracture,</HI> or <HI>Di&s;location</HI> in the <HI>Bones;</HI> any
thing <HI>Analogical</HI> to <HI>Spavin,</HI> or <HI>Ring-bone,</HI> for
the&s;e will bring down the <HI>Makret</HI> wonderfully;
And to be <HI>clean Limb'd, clo&s;e coupled, well
joynted, will advance it as much. The Age is ve|ry
con&s;iderable;</HI> but they that <HI>&s;ell them,</HI> did not
<HI>breed them,</HI> and therefore they know nothing,
more or le&s;s of that: Two waies they have to
find out the Age; the one is, to &s;tand to the
courte&s;ie of the <HI>Slaves,</HI> but they are not bound
to make any &s;uch Di&s;covery, and therefore
they go by general conjectures from the <HI>Beard,
Face,</HI> or <HI>Hair;</HI> but a good &s;et of <HI>Teeth</HI> will
make any one <HI>Ten Years Younger,</HI> and a broken
one <HI>Ten Years Older than the Truth;</HI> for if they
were <HI>Five Hundred Years Old all is a Ca&s;e,</HI> if they
could but eat and work; or if they could not
eat, yet if they could but work, or if they nei|ther
eat nor work, if their Skins would but fetch
in the Mony again. You &s;hall have the <HI>Seller</HI>
commend his Goods to the Sky, and the <HI>Buyer</HI>
on the other hand, as much undervalue them,
and the true <HI>Market-price</HI> commonly lies ju&s;t
<HI>between them; but &s;o it is all the World over.</HI> Or

Pi&s;h, &s;aies the <HI>Buyer,</HI> He looks like a <HI>Pillard,</HI>
like a very <HI>Meacock</HI> at his <HI>Provinder,</HI> and one
that &s;eems to be &s;urfeited. But they are very
curious in examining the Hands; for if they

<P>When any are &s;old, they mu&s;t be trotted

<HI>Combating with Bea&s;ts below.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t Adventure I met with after I was
brought to my <HI>Patron</HI>'s Hou&s;e (for &s;o I mu&s;t
now &s;tile him) had well nigh co&s;t me my Life.
My <HI>Patron</HI>'s Father being de&s;irous to &s;ee his
Sons <HI>Penny-worth,</HI> commanded me up into a
<HI>Gallery,</HI> which looked into the Court; he be|gan
to in&s;ult over me with in&s;upportable &s;corn,
reflecting upon me becau&s;e I was a <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI>
and ca&s;t out &s;ome Expre&s;&s;ions which did really
reflect upon the Per&s;on of my <HI>Rdeemer,</HI> though
I have heard wor&s;e &s;ince.) My Neck was not
yet bowed, nor my Heart broken to the Yoke
of Bondage; I could not well brook, becau&s;e
I had not ben u&s;ed then to &s;uch Language; and
<PB N="13" REF="24">
becau&s;e I could not expre&s;s my &s;elf in the <HI>Mo|re&s;co,</HI>
or <HI>Lingua Franc,</HI> I &s;upplyed it with Signs;
and <HI>imitating the Coblers Yarke,</HI> I &s;ignified both
waies as well as I could, <HI>That their Prophet was
but a Cobler.</HI> I confe&s;s, my meaning was no
more, but that <HI>Mahomet,</HI> by the help of <HI>Sergius,</HI>
a <HI>Ne&s;torian Monk,</HI> and <HI>Abdalla</HI> the <HI>Jew,</HI> had
patch'd up a Cento of <HI>Jewi&s;h,</HI> and <HI>Monki&s;h Fop|peries,</HI>
which was now their <HI>Religion.</HI> But he,
without the preamble of many Railing words,
fell upon me with &s;evere blows; whatever <HI>Rage</HI>
and <HI>Fury</HI> his <HI>Hands</HI> or <HI>Feet</HI> could <HI>Execute,</HI> that
I felt; and my intreaties did but enrage his
<HI>Choler,</HI> &s;o that I &s;aw I might &s;ooner blow out
the Fire with a pair of Bellows, than lenifie his
pa&s;&s;ion with Prayers; I had no other way but
this, to make an offer of leaping down out of
the <HI>Gallery</HI> into the <HI>Court,</HI> and therefore clap|ping
my hands upon the <HI>Rails,</HI> as if I would
throw my &s;elf head-long down over them, and
rather chu&s;e to receive my Death from the
<HI>Pavement,</HI> than his <HI>Hands,</HI> he pre&s;ently a&s;&s;wa|ges,
if not his <HI>Rage,</HI> yet the <HI>Execution</HI> of it.
The Old Gentleman knew very well, that if I
lo&s;t my Life, his Son mu&s;t lo&s;e his pre&s;ent Mo|ney,
and future profit; <HI>for there's little made
out of a Dead Man's Skin:</HI> and therefore he re|&s;pites
my further puni&s;hment till my <HI>Patron</HI>'s
Return, and then indeed this reputed Bla&s;phe|my
of mine with full cry was carried to his
Ears, <HI>and it lo&s;t nothing in the telling,</HI> but was
<PB N="14" REF="25">
aggravated to purpo&s;e: My <HI>Patron</HI> being Na|turally
a very pa&s;&s;ionate Man, &s;aid nothing,
but without Examination, drew out his long
Knife, (which they con&s;tantly wear by their
&s;ides) and made at me; and had there doubt|le&s;s
put an end to my Life and Captivity at
once, had not his Wife, who was there &s;ea&s;o|nably
pre&s;ent, taken him in her Arms, and
&s;weeten'd him into more moderate Coun&s;els.
Some will be ready enough to &s;ay, that I was
but a <HI>Martyr to my own Folly:</HI> This was not
a place for Di&s;pute, but Obedience. Well, I
learnt from hence two Le&s;&s;ons: One, <HI>That
when the Body is a Slave, the Rea&s;on mu&s;t not ex|pect
to be free; and where the whole outward Man
is in Bondage, the Tongue mu&s;t not plead Exem|ption.</HI>
A Second, That it's fair for Slaves to
enjoy <HI>the freedom of their own Con&s;ciences, with|out
Reviling anothers Religion,</HI> though errone|ous;
<HI>and this Wit I bought,</HI> as it fell out, <HI>a pret|ty
good Penny-worth.</HI></P>
<P>When the Storm was over, my employ|ment
was a&s;&s;igned me (for they had rather &s;ee
a Slave Dead than Idle) and for about half a
Year it lay in trudging on Errands, bearing
Burdens, and di&s;charging other Dome&s;tick
Services at Command, wherein the only con|&s;ideration
was, <HI>That it was Commanded,</HI> and not
<HI>What was Commanded.</HI></P>
<P>At this time my <HI>Patron</HI> had a part in a <HI>Man
of War,</HI> which carried Twelve Guns: She be|ing
<PB N="15" REF="25" MS="y">
at Sea, (with &s;ome others of the &s;ame place)
met with an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchant, <HI>Laden with
Plate,</HI> and other Rich Commodities from <HI>Spain,</HI>
and Bound for <HI>London,</HI> (one <HI>I&s;aac</HI> being <HI>Ma|&s;ter)</HI>
and after a very &s;harp, though &s;hort Di&s;|pute,
the <HI>Algerines</HI> carried her, and brought
her &s;afe home. The Adventurers divide their
Booty, and being high flown with this &s;ucce&s;s,
they Re&s;olve to fit her out again to carry more
Guns; and from hence grew my new employ|ment.
Upon the <HI>Capenters</HI> I attended, wait|ed
on the <HI>Smiths,</HI> to get the Iron-work fitted,
and fini&s;hed; and truly he allowed me more
for Portage than to the ordinary <HI>Hammels,</HI> or
common <HI>Porters.</HI></P>
<P>When this Ship was now fitted for another
Adventure, my <HI>Patron</HI> tells me, <HI>I mu&s;t go in
her;</HI> it was a nipping word: I pleaded, that I
was no <HI>Sea-man,</HI> under&s;tood nothing of the
<HI>Mariners</HI> Art, and therefore as he could ex|pect
little Service from me in that kind, &s;o I
mu&s;t expect mo&s;t rigorous treatment, becau&s;e
I could not acquit my &s;elf in the Service as well
as others; he removed my Pleas, and promi|&s;ed
I &s;hould not be wronged; but there was
more at the bottom than all this: For here
a Ca&s;e of Con&s;cience offered it &s;elf, <HI>Whether I
might without Sin in any Ca&s;e fight again&s;t Chri|&s;tians,
on the Port of the common Enemy of all
Chri&s;tianity?</HI> The be&s;t Re&s;olution I could give
my &s;elf, was this; That fir&s;t, my employ|my
<PB N="16" REF="26" MS="y">
employment would only lie in managing
the Tackle, which will kill no Body; but it
was replied, <HI>That without the due management
of the Tackle, all the Guns in the Ship would
kill no Body:</HI> Secondly, therefore I an&s;wered,
That it was not evident that they would en|gage
again&s;t <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> more than all the re&s;t
of Mankind, for all the World are their Ene|mies,
who are Rich enough to invite them,
and too weak to re&s;i&s;t them; but my <HI>Patron</HI>
had a Solution worth all the&s;e: He told me
peremptorily, <HI>I mu&s;t, and &s;hould go;</HI> I found
my &s;elf under force, I was a Pre&s;t Man: who
could not examine the Ju&s;tice of the Cau&s;e. In
a word, his Commands were back'd with Com|pul&s;ion,
and whatever his Authority was, he
had more Power, than I had Courage to de|ny,
or Strength to re&s;i&s;t; and go I did. Yet
this I will &s;ay for him, he &s;poke to the Captain
and Officers of the Ship, to treat me civilly,
that is, le&s;s cruelly than other Slaves were treat|ed:
He gave me &s;ome Money al&s;o in my
Pocket, bought me Clothes, and laid me in
Provi&s;ion above the Ships allowance.</P>
<P>Nine Weeks we were at Sea, within, and
without the <HI>Streights,</HI> Crui&s;ing, and Picka|rooning
up and down, at la&s;t we met with
one poor <HI>Hungarian French Man of War,</HI>
whom we took, and &s;o returned.</P>
<P>My <HI>Patron</HI> having been at great charges in
fitting, and manning out this Ship, and the
<PB N="17" REF="26" MS="y">
Repri&s;als &s;o &s;lenderly an&s;wering his great co&s;t,
and greater hopes, told me, I mu&s;t allow him
two <HI>Dollers per Month,</HI> and Live a&s;hore where
I would, and get it were I could. This was a
hard Chapter, That he that could not main|tain
him&s;elf, &s;hould be compelled to contribute
to the maintenance of another; it was difficult
to rai&s;e encrea&s;e out of no &s;tock, and to pay
Intere&s;t out of no Principal; but there was no
contending; It co&s;t me much debate with my
&s;elf, and I turn'd my thoughts into all forms
and &s;hapes, but all Projects that pre&s;ented them|&s;elves
were incumbred with &s;o many difficul|ties,
that they amounted very near to impo&s;&s;i|bilities.
The more I con&s;ulted, the further I
found my &s;elf from a conclu&s;ion, and I could
&s;ee no way but one, (but that was worth a
Thou&s;and, could I have made the be&s;t of it,)
and that was to commit my &s;elf to God, who
had brought me into this &s;trait, be&s;eeching
him that he would bring me out of it.</P>
<P>But that my tru&s;ting to God might not be
a Cloak for Lazine&s;s, or a Pillow for Sloath to
re&s;t upon, I addre&s;t my &s;elf to an <HI>Engli&s;h-man,</HI>
who&s;e condition was that of a Slave, who&s;e
Calling was that of a <HI>Taylor.</HI> He at fir&s;t word
coun&s;elled me to come and &s;tay with him, and
he would teach me to work of his Trade. I ac|counted
nothing ba&s;e that was hone&s;t, and ne|ce&s;&s;ity
would ennoble a far meaner Emploi|ment,
and very readily clo&s;ed in my thoughts
<PB N="18" REF="27">
with his motion, and was &s;uddenly elevated
into huge hopes that I &s;hould now be in a ca|pacity
to an&s;wer my <HI>Patron</HI>'s demands, and e&s;|cape
his la&s;h. But my &s;traits were not (it &s;eems)
great enough to glorifie God; nor my condi|tion
mean enough to magnifie his Power in
rai&s;ing me; I was not reduced to that Extre|mety
which would make an oportunity to ex|alt
his appearing Mercy; for when I came to
him the next <HI>Day,</HI> I perceived by his &s;ilence
that his mind was changed, and I was loth,
either out of Mode&s;ty or Pride, to give him
further trouble; and therefore interpreting his
&s;ilence to be a more civil way of denial, I left
him, and once more Launched out into the
wide World.</P>
<P>In this forlorn po&s;ture I wandred, but nei|ther
knew, nor much cared whither, though
the wi&s;e God both knew, and cared; and his
Providence directed me to another <HI>Engli&s;h-man,</HI>
who was &s;itting in a little Shop: He ask|ed
me what News? And (as that which is up|permo&s;t
alwaies comes out fir&s;t) I pre&s;ently be|gan
the Story of my de&s;perate Condition;
how the Rigid Law of my <HI>Patron</HI> had impo&s;ed
two <HI>Dollers per Month</HI> upon me, and I knew
not where to levy the lea&s;t Mite of it: He
heard, con&s;idered, pityed my Condition, and
invited me to come and &s;it in the Shop with
him; but &s;eeing nothing but the bare Walls,
I asked him, to what end? What Trade &s;hould
<PB N="19" REF="27">
we drive there? There's not much difference
between &s;tarving in the Streets, and in the Shop.
Country-man (&s;aid he) I drive here an unknown
Trade; here I &s;ell Lead, Iron, Shot, Strong-wa|ters,
Tobacco, and many other things. This
motion was a great deal to good to be refue&s;d,
and I think at that time no tolerable condition
would have &s;tck with me.</P>
<P>I acquainted my <HI>Patron</HI> with my De&s;ign,
pleaded I wanted &s;tock to &s;et up with; he lent
me a <HI>&s;mall modicum,</HI> and with another pittance
that I had privately re&s;erved of my own, I be|gan
to Trade. That very Night I went and
bought a parcel of Tobacco, the next Morning
we dre&s;s'd it, cut it, and fitted it for Sale; and
the World &s;eemed to &s;mile on us wonderfully.
In this way of Partner-&s;hip we continued for
&s;ome while, and what we got clear, we divided
every week according to the proportion of our
re&s;pective &s;tocks. In a while, finding the
World to come in upon us, we ventured up|on
no le&s;s then a whole Butt of Wine, &s;ome
Money we had, and &s;ome Credit: This Wine
we drew out, and got con&s;iderably by it. But
it's very difficult to maintain moderation in an
exalted State, for even our State was capable
of better and wor&s;e; for my Partner being ele|vated
with our good &s;ucce&s;s, grew a good Fel|low,
and a bad Husband; neglecting his bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
went tipling, and fndling up and down,
and the Concerns of the Shop and Trade lay
wholly upon my Shoulders.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="28">
It fell out, that one <HI>John Randal,</HI> who with
his Wife and Child were taken in the &s;ame
Ship with my &s;elf, being put to the &s;ame &s;hifts
with my &s;elf, and, as 'tis very common, ha|ving
a Monthly Tax impo&s;ed upon him by
his Patron, which he mu&s;t &s;crape out where
he could, and be&s;ides maintain him&s;elf, his
Wife, and Child, went up and down &s;eeking
for Relief, at la&s;t the poor Man &s;traggled to
our Shop: His Ca&s;e made great impre&s;&s;ion up|on
me, I could not but con&s;ider the goodne&s;s
of God to me, that &s;hould now be in a condi|tion
to advi&s;e, and help another, who &s;o lately
wanted both my &s;elf; and it had this operati|on
upon me, that I would not &s;uffer a poor di|&s;tre&s;&s;ed
Country-man, a Fellow-Captive, a Fel|low-Chri&s;tian
to &s;tand begging at that door,
where I had &s;o lately &s;tood my &s;elf: Shall I
&s;hut the Door, or my Heart upon him, when
God hath opened a Door of hope to me in the
day of my Trouble? Shall I &s;o ill requite the
Lord's kindne&s;s to me? Surely that God who
<HI>comforts us in our Tribulations,</HI> expects that we
&s;hould comfort others in theirs, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1. 4. I
bad him therefore come in, and knowing him
to be a <HI>Glover</HI> by Trade, advi&s;ed him to learn
to make Canvas Cloaths for Sea-men that are
Slaves; and for my own part, he &s;hould &s;it
<HI>Rent-free;</HI> but if my Partner would in&s;i&s;t up|on
his Moiety, he mu&s;t be willing to &s;atisfie
him, for I had no power to determine of ano|ther's

It were tedious to trouble the <HI>Reader</HI> how I
wore out three or four irk&s;ome Years in this
way of Trading. All this while there was no
dawning of deliverance from our Bondage:
As one Year left us, another found us, and de|livered
us over Captives to the next: Our
condition was bad, and in danger every day
of being wor&s;e, as the mutable Humours of
our Patrons determin'd upon us, for our Shop
and Trade was no free-hold: The Truth is,
in time we were &s;o habituated to Bondage, that
we almo&s;t forgot Liberty, and grew &s;tupid, and
&s;en&s;le&s;s of our Slavery; like <HI>I&s;&s;achar,</HI> we <HI>couch|ed
down between our burdens, we bowed our Shoul|ders
to bear, and became Servants to Tribute,</HI>
Gen. 49. 14, 15. And were in danger to be
like tho&s;e <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> in <HI>Babylon,</HI> who being once
&s;ettled, forgot <HI>Canaan, and dwelt with the King
for his work,</HI> 1 Chron. 4. 23. We &s;eem'd as if
our Ears had been bored, and we had vowed
to &s;erve our Patrons for ever. Long Bondage
breaks the Spirits, it &s;catters hope off, and di&s;|courages
all attempts for freedom: And there
were more evils attended our condition than
the bodily torture, which we were alwaies li|able
to, and &s;ometimes endured.</P>
<P>1. We were under a perpetual temptation
to deny the Lord that bought us, to make our
Souls Slaves, that our Bodies might recover
Liberty. As <HI>Satan</HI> once tempted <HI>Job</HI> to <HI>Cur&s;e
God, and Dye;</HI> &s;o he knew how to change his
<PB N="22" REF="29">
Note to us, and accommodate his Snare to our
condition, to <HI>Cur&s;e God, that we might Live.</HI>
How many have made Ship-wrack of Faith,
that they might not be Chained to the <HI>Gal|liees?</HI>
I can never enough admire the grace of
that Promi&s;e, <HI>P&s;al. 1253. The Rod of the wicked
&s;hal not always ro&s;t upon the lot of the Righteous, le&s;t
the Righteous put forth their hands to Iniquity;</HI> nor
ever enough adore the faithfulne&s;s of him,
<HI>who will not &s;uffer us to be tempted above that we
are able,</HI> 1 Cor. 10. 13.</P>
<P>And 2. Evil is the unmaning, and di&s;pirit|ing
of the Soul to worthy Actions; for we are
apt to put on the Temper and Spirit of Slaves
with the Habit, and the Chri&s;tians of the <HI>Greek</HI>
Communion, are a very &s;ad in&s;tance of this
Truth.</P>
<P>And 3. We were very much at a lo&s;s for
the Preaching of the World: And yet herein

<P>THE gracious God looking upon the affli|ction

Ship taken by &s;ome of our <HI>Algerine</HI> Pirates, and
in her one Mr. <HI>Devereux Sprat,</HI> a Mini&s;ter of

we addre&s;&s;ed our &s;elves to him, and

&s;o hard upon our Spirrits: <HI>Thrice a week</HI> this

hired at &s;ome di&s;tance from our Shop, where I
&s;towed &s;ome Goods that were peculiarly my
own when we fell into a greater &s;troke of trade.
To our Meetings re&s;orted many, &s;ometimes
three or four&s;core, and though we met <HI>next the

our Patrons <HI>their demands,</HI> we might, without
any di&s;turbance from them, <HI>Wor&s;hip our God,
according to our Con&s;ciences:</HI> It's true, that &s;uch
were the circum&s;tances of the Slavery of many

<PB N="25" REF="30">
&s;uch the wretched carele&s;sne&s;s of others, that

<P>IT is time to re-a&s;&s;ume my own concerns, and
look a little into my own Condition, which,
through the good providence of God, was much
better than that of many of my poor Brethren

ebbings and flowings in my Tranquility: whil&s;t
I was managing my Trade very &s;toutly and &s;uc|ce&s;sfully,
<HI>(John Randal</HI> working with me in my

left all to me: One day I changed a twenty &s;hil|ling-piece
of Gold for Silver with a Friend, and
having the mony chinking in my hand, <HI>John
Randal</HI> asked me, what I did with &s;o much mo|ny?
I de&s;ired him to keep it for me, till our re|turn,
and he &s;hould know: For he being not
very well, we agreed to walk out of the Town
to take the fre&s;h Air; a liberty, which for &s;ome|what

though we <HI>Actually de&s;igned no &s;uch thing.</HI> As
we were prying about the Sea-&s;ide, one of the
Spies appointed con&s;tantly to watch, le&s;t any of

charged us <HI>with an attempt to make an E&s;cape?</HI>
we flatly denied it, but he laid hold on us; there
was no re&s;i&s;ting; Obey we mu&s;t, and accor|dingly

there I wrought till I had &s;poiled all that I laid

was the Ne&s;t indeed, but all the Birds were &s;lown;</HI>
for in my ab&s;ence, (poor <HI>John Randal</HI> being
Lame, and not able to work, my Partner &s;ome|time

the <HI>Dutch</HI> man and my &s;elf returned to our Pa|tron,

the Civil Wars were now broke out, and to
that height of exa&s;peration, that tho&s;e of the
&s;ame Nation, and, perhaps Blood, would
hardly give Quarter of Life one to another: If
the Name of <HI>Native Countrey</HI> bewitcht me, if
That dazled my Eyes; &s;urely <HI>where-ever we are
well is our Countrey,</HI> and <HI>all the World is Home
to him that thrives all over the World:</HI> And why
&s;hould the <HI>Name of Bondage,</HI> why &s;hould <HI>a
word</HI> grate &s;o har&s;hly upon my <HI>delicate Spirit,</HI>
when the &s;ting of it was taken away? <HI>Liberty</HI>
is <HI>a good word;</HI> but a Man <HI>cannot buy a Meals
meat with a word:</HI> And Slavery is <HI>a hard word,</HI>
but <HI>it breaks no mans back.</HI> Thou&s;ands <HI>are more
Slaves</HI> then I, who are yet their <HI>own Masters,
and le&s;s at Liberty</HI> then my &s;elf, who have the
<HI>free rake and range</HI> of the whole World. But
yet my Patron's Favour was <HI>no free hold;</HI> I held
not my Happy time <HI>in fee &s;imple,</HI> all was <HI>advo|luntatem

who might be of <HI>another Character,</HI> and
then my Condition would be therefore wo&s;e
becau&s;e I had known a better.</P>
<P>2. I might be Que&s;tioned in point of <HI>Inge|nuity,</HI>
how I could be &s;o unworthy to leave him,
who had Loved me? <HI>Would</HI> not all that &s;hould
hear of it, <HI>Condemn me of ill Nature, to leave</HI>
without taking <HI>leave,</HI> one that had been <HI>a Fa|ther</HI>
to me, who might have u&s;ed the Right of
<HI>a Lord;</HI> and <HI>u&s;ed</HI> me <HI>as a Child,</HI> who might have

&s;train courte&s;ie;</HI> here was no <HI>Farewel Patron,</HI>
in the Ca&s;e, and therefore I &s;oon overcame <HI>that.</HI></P>
<P>But, 3. It might be Que&s;tioned in the Court
of Con&s;cience, whether it were not <HI>down-right
Theft</HI> to with-draw my &s;elf from <HI>his Service,</HI>
who had <HI>bought</HI> me, <HI>paid</HI> for <HI>me,</HI> enter'd upon
me, <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;s'd and enjoy'd me,</HI> as his own <HI>pro|per

<HI>felo de &s;e,</HI> in <HI>&s;tealing him&s;elf,</HI> as well as <HI>killing
him&s;elf?</HI> And whether he is not the greater <HI>&s;elf-robber,</HI>
that &s;teals <HI>away him&s;elf,</HI> then he that
&s;teals away <HI>from him&s;elf?</HI> But I much que&s;tion|ed
<HI>their propriety</HI> to me; my Patron's <HI>Title</HI> was
<HI>rotten</HI> at the <HI>Foundation:</HI> Man is too noble a
Creature to be made &s;ubject to <HI>a deed of bar|gain
and Sale;</HI> and my <HI>con&s;ent</HI> was never ask'd
to all their bargains, which is E&s;&s;ential, to create
a right of Dominion over <HI>a Rational Creature,
where he was not born a Subject.</HI> If I had <HI>for|feited</HI>
my Life or Liberty, <HI>the Law might take
it;</HI> but I was not Con&s;cious to my &s;elf of any
<HI>&s;uch forfeiture,</HI> but that I was <HI>at my own Di&s;po|&s;al.</HI></P>
<P>Thus all was clear and quiet, and we went on
with our De&s;ign, which I now fir&s;t opened to
them: That I had contrived the Model of a
Boat, which being formed in parcels, and after|wards
put together, might, by the &s;uper-inten|dency
of Divine Providence, prove <HI>an Ark</HI> to
deliver us out of the hands of our Enemies. This
was &s;oon &s;aid, and greedily entertained; to <HI>E|&s;cape</HI>
was a plea&s;ant <HI>word,</HI> the Name of <HI>Liberty</HI>
made Mu&s;ick in our Ears, and our wi&s;hing hearts
danced to <HI>the Tune of it;</HI> and <HI>a Boat</HI> was as <HI>pro|mi&s;ing
a means</HI> as any thing could be imagined:
But when once their thoughts <HI>cooled,</HI> and came
<HI>more &s;edately</HI> to look into the difficulties of it;
they appeared <HI>innumerable,</HI> and &s;ome of them
&s;eemed <HI>in&s;uperable;</HI> and &s;ome things that had
<PB N="49" REF="43">
pa&s;t currant in my own thoughts, and I went
clever away with them, without any rub; yet
when they came to be pierced into with <HI>more
Eyes,</HI> and &s;cann'd upon <HI>more Fingers,</HI> they were
attended with con&s;iderable impediments: where
this Boat &s;hould be built, was one &s;taggering
Que&s;tion: Where it &s;hould be Lanched, and
where put to Sea, was a Choaking Objection:
How we &s;hould e&s;cape tho&s;e <HI>Argus</HI>-eyes, which
are always ob&s;erving us by Day, was a gravel|ling
Qhaery; or how to get out of the City by
Night, who&s;e Walls are &s;o high, who&s;e Gates
are &s;o clo&s;e &s;hut, and &s;trongly Guarded was
another vexatious Quaery: How we &s;hould be
Rigged and Victualled for &s;uch a Voyage, was
a con&s;iderable enquiry: and whether we &s;hould
de&s;ign, was not to be &s;lighted. But how <HI>&s;uch a
little Skiff,</HI> rather than Boat, &s;hould be able <HI>to
Weather all the Accidents of the Sea,</HI> was <HI>a
Neck Que&s;tion,</HI> enough to <HI>&s;trangle Faith, and
&s;tifle with us with De&s;pair.</HI></P>
<P>To the&s;e Objections, I An&s;wered. That I
had de&s;igned <HI>my own Cellar,</HI> as the meete&s;t place
wherein to <HI>build the Boat;</HI> that when it was there
Built, it might be taken <HI>in pieces again,</HI> and car|ried
out of the City <HI>in parcels,</HI> and be&s;towed in
private places till things were <HI>ripe for Executi|on.</HI>
That for a place where to put to Sea, it
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ould be time enough to determine upon that
when we had fini&s;h'd our Ve&s;&s;el: That <HI>Mayork</HI>
was the mo&s;t commodious place to de&s;ign to
<PB N="50" REF="44">
Land in: But in general I told them to this pur|po&s;e;
That if we <HI>never attempted</HI> any thing till
we had <HI>An&s;wered</HI> all <HI>Objections,</HI> we mu&s;t &s;it with
our Fingers in our Mouths all our days, and pine,
and langui&s;h out our tedious Lives in Bondage,
<HI>Let us be up and doing, and God would be with
us. To begin is one half of our work;</HI> Let us
make an E&s;&s;ay, and An&s;wer particular Objecti|ons
as they Offer'd them&s;elves, and as we met
with them in our work. That the Project had
<HI>its difficulties,</HI> was confe&s;&s;ed; but what has
not, that is <HI>Commendable, and Glorious?</HI> Yet
whatever difficulties <HI>&amp;</HI> dangers we could meet
with, <HI>Liberty,</HI> kept in <HI>our Eye,</HI> would &s;weeten
the dangers we might encounter in Attempting&punc;
They were all well &s;ati<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">fied with what was &s;aid
and all engaged to venture the utmo&s;t <HI>they were,</HI>

<P>IN the Cellar where we had Wor&s;hip'd God,
we began our Work; and it was <HI>not the Ho|line&s;s,</HI>
but <HI>the Privacy of the place</HI> that invited
us, and advi&s;ed us to it. And fir&s;t, we provi|ded
<HI>a piece of Timber about twelve Foot long, to
make the Keel:</HI> But becau&s;e it was impo&s;&s;ible
to convey a piece of Timber of that length out
of the City, but it mu&s;t be &s;een; and of that
&s;hape, but it mu&s;t be <HI>&s;u&s;pected,</HI> and that Su&s;pi|tion
would bring us into <HI>Examination,</HI> and the
<HI>Rack, or Battoon</HI> might extort <HI>a Confe&s;&s;ion</HI> out
of the <HI>mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">t re&s;olved, and obstinate brea&s;t;</HI> we
therefore cut it <HI>in</HI> two pieces, and fitted it for
Joynting thus in the middle. Our next care
was the <HI>Timbers or Ribs</HI> of the Poat, which
we contrived thus; every one of the Timbers
was <HI>made</HI> of three <HI>pieces,</HI> and joynted in two
<HI>places,</HI> becau&s;e a whole Rib at its full length,
would <HI>be</HI> lyable <HI>to the</HI> &s;ame inconveniences with
the Keel. Now under&s;tand, that the joynts of
the Ribs were not made with <HI>Mortice and Te|non,</HI>
<PB N="52" REF="45">
but the flat &s;ide of one of the three Pieces
was laid over the other, and <HI>two holes</HI> were bo|red
at <HI>every joynt,</HI> into which <HI>two Nails</HI> were
to be put, when we &s;hould <HI>joyn the parcels</HI> of our
Boat together: You mu&s;t under&s;tand further,
that <HI>the&s;e two holes at every joynt</HI> were not made
in a <HI>&s;trait line, parallel with the &s;ides</HI> of the pieces,
for then the three pieces, which make one Rib,
being joyned together would have made <HI>one
&s;trait piece;</HI> a Form which would by no means
comport with the U&s;e and De&s;ign of the Tim|bers;
But &s;o, that when <HI>both the Nails were in
the holes,</HI> each Joynt would make <HI>an obtu&s;e an|gle,</HI>
and &s;o incline &s;o near towards <HI>a Semi-Circu+lar
Figure,</HI> as our Occa&s;ion required. All this
while here is no vi&s;ible Provi&s;ion made <HI>for
boards,</HI> to cloath the naked Ribs of our Boat,
without which, the Keel and Timbers looked
but like an u&s;ele&s;s Anatomy; but neither had
we, nor was it po&s;&s;ible we &s;hould have any
boards in our Ve&s;&s;el: <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> is the be&s;t Arti|ficer

<HI>Contingency;</HI> to which two the World has been
beholden for the mo&s;t u&s;eful inventions, which
at this day do ea&s;e the Labour and Toyl of wea|ried
Mankind. For the Joynting of the&s;e Boards;
and the Nailing of them, to make the Boat <HI>Wa|ter-tite,</HI>
would require &s;uch <HI>Hammering,</HI> and
that Hammering would make <HI>&s;uch a clamarou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">

us the Jealous Eyes of the <HI>Algerines,</HI> who
<PB N="53" REF="45">
<HI>about their Wives and Slaves are in&s;upportably
&s;u&s;picious:</HI> And therefore from the fir&s;t Con|ception
of the De&s;ign, I always re&s;olved upon
<HI>a Canvas:</HI> In pur&s;uance of which thought, be|ing
all &s;atisfied that it was <HI>practicable;</HI> we bought
as much &s;trong Canvas as would cover our Boat
<HI>twice over,</HI> upon the <HI>Convex of the Carine;</HI>
We provided al&s;o as much <HI>Pitch, Tar, and
Tallow</HI> as would &s;erve to make it a kind of <HI>a
Tawparlin Sear-cloth,</HI> to &s;waddle <HI>the naked
body of our Infant-Boat:</HI> With Earthen pots
to melt done our Materials in; and prefixt a
night wherein we might Execute that part of our
Labour. The <HI>two Carpenters, and my &s;elf</HI> were
appointed to this Service, and the Cellar was
the place where we met. Matters had hither|to
run very evenly, and &s;moothly, but here
we met with &s;ome <HI>di&s;couraging rubs.</HI> For when
we had &s;topt all the Chinks and Crannies of the
Cellar, that the &s;treame of the melted Materials
might not creep out and betray us, (there be|ing
no Chimney,) we had not been long at our
work before I felt my &s;elf exceeding &s;ick, with
the &s;trong, and unu&s;ual &s;cent of the melted Li|quor;
I was forced to go out into the &s;treets to
<HI>ga&s;p for breath,</HI> where meeting with the <HI>cool
Air,</HI> it over-came me, I &s;wooned, fell down
brake my face, and there lay: My Compa|nions
mi&s;&s;ing me, made out to &s;eek me, found
me in this &s;ad plight, and carried me in again,
though exceeding &s;ick, and un&s;erviceable. They
<PB N="54" REF="46">
had not proceeded much further before I heard
one of them complain he was &s;ick, and cou'd
proceed no further, and now our work &s;tood
&s;till: I plainly &s;aw that <HI>our hopeful Project,</HI> that
had hitherto &s;o &s;moothly proceeded, mu&s;t needs
mi&s;carry, and Prove Abortive; for it would be
impo&s;&s;ible to fini&s;h it <HI>this night:</HI> and if we once
<HI>parted,</HI> and &s;uffered our Spirits <HI>to cool over</HI> the
<HI>De&s;ign,</HI> they would never cea&s;e cooling till they
were <HI>&s;tone-cold, and hard frozen;</HI> and there|fore
I advi&s;ed to &s;et open the Door, and com|mit
our &s;elves, and our work to Gods Protecti|on:
For I told them they could not but know,
that <HI>if any Di&s;covery</HI> were <HI>made, the burden</HI>
would <HI>fall heavie&s;t upon my &s;houlders;</HI> and my
<HI>Back or Feet mu&s;t pay for all.</HI> At length, we
re&s;olved to &s;et the Cellar-door wide open, and
as &s;oon as that was done, and the &s;tream pretty
well gone out, we came to our &s;elves again, cou|ragiou&s;ly
went <HI>on</HI> with our bu&s;ine&s;s, and pitched
one half that Night. The next night we met
again, &s;et open the Door, and whil&s;t they <HI>plyed</HI>
the work, I &s;tood Sentinel at the Door to give
Notice of <HI>approaching</HI> danger; but we <HI>happily</HI>
fini&s;h'd the whole, and while it was yet dark,
carried it to my Shop, which was about a Fur|long
from the Cellar, and there at pre&s;ent &s;ecu|red
it.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not que&s;tion the Readers Ingenuity &s;o

but what &s;hould I trouble him with tho&s;e things
that <HI>are common to all other Boats,</HI> I mention
only what was <HI>Peculiar to our own;</HI> and I do
not intend to trouble him with <HI>the Boat-wright's
Lecture.</HI></P>
<P>In our Cellar we fitted all things, we made
the Timbers fit to the Keel, and the Canvas fit
for the Timbers, and the Seats fit to the whole,
and then took all in pieces again, and laying our
Heads together, plotting how to convey all out
of the Town, and lodg them in &s;ecure and tru|&s;ty
places.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t&punc; <HI>for our Keel,</HI> we all with unani|mous
con&s;ent judged <HI>Will. Adams</HI> the fitte&s;t
Per&s;on to execute that part of the De&s;ign, for
he had long Exerci&s;ed the Trade of a Brick-lay|er,
and his Employment lay much without the
Town; and be&s;ides, he u&s;ed &s;uch pieces in level|ling
his work. He therefore; accourted with
his <HI>Apron before him, his Trowel in his hand,</HI> and
one of the pieces <HI>upon his &s;houlder,</HI> undertook
it, and without the lea&s;t Ob&s;ervation went cle|verly
away with it, and as he &s;aw his Opportu|nity,
hid it in the bottom of a Hedg; and not
long after conveyed out its Fellow, and Lodged
it in the &s;ame place. This &s;ucceeding &s;o hap|pily,
we &s;aw no great difficulty <HI>in the Timbers,</HI>
for we put <HI>one nail into a hole of every joynt,</HI> and
then you will ea&s;ily conceive, that <HI>the two ex|tream
pieces of one Rib</HI> being <HI>folded inwards
upon the middlemo&s;t,</HI> will lye <HI>in the room of one
<PB N="56" REF="47">
of the pieces for length,</HI> excepting that litile that
<HI>the ends of each piece</HI> were beyond the holes:
Now, by general con&s;ent, the conveying the&s;e
out of the City was committed to one, who&s;e
Employment was to wa&s;h &s;mall Clothes by the
Sea-&s;ide: He puts them into his bag among&s;t his
Clothes, and &s;o very orderly carried them out,
and hid them where he could find <HI>mo&s;t commodi|ous
&s;towage,</HI> but yet <HI>with Re&s;pect to nearne&s;s to
that Place</HI> where the Keel was laid.</P>
<P>But how to convey <HI>our Tarpawlin</HI> &s;afe out of
Town &s;eemed mo&s;t difficult; by night it was
impo&s;&s;ible, and by day the difficulties very con|&s;iderable,
and the danger <HI>proportionable; for the
Gates</HI> are &s;trictly watch'd, the <HI>Streets</HI> crowded,
the <HI>Spies pickering</HI> in every corner, and <HI>the
bulk of the Canvas</HI> thus dre&s;&s;ed was very great.
To <HI>divide it</HI> had been to <HI>ruin our &s;elves,</HI> for no
&s;titching together again, could &s;o <HI>cheat the &s;ear|ching
water,</HI> but it would find out <HI>the needle-holes.</HI>
At la&s;t we ventured upon this way; we
put it into a large Sack, and committed it to him
that u&s;ed <HI>to wa&s;h Clothes,</HI> and le&s;t any &s;hould
clap a jealous hand upon it, we put a Pillow over
our Canvas within the bag, that &s;o its &s;oftne&s;s
might delude the Inqui&s;itor, and make it pa&s;s
for Clothes. Let none di&s;pi&s;e, or condemn the&s;e
as <HI>low, mean pieces of contrivance,</HI> for we had
not <HI>Polititians tools to work withal;</HI> but the le&s;s
was <HI>our Policy,</HI> the more glorious does <HI>the wi&s;|dom
of God</HI> &s;hine in &s;ucceeding it, and yet even
<PB N="57" REF="47">
<HI>that little</HI> Policy we were guilty of, was of <HI>his
be&s;towing</HI> al&s;o; <HI>what of &s;in</HI> was in all of it, was
entirely <HI>our own;</HI> what of <HI>Power, Wi&s;dom, and
Succe&s;s,</HI> was <HI>all his:</HI> But our Agent e&s;caped
happily with it, and Lodging it in a &s;ecret place,
returned.</P>
<P>We had yet many things to provide, and
Oars are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, they were of <HI>the
Quorum</HI> to an E&s;cape <HI>by &s;ea:</HI> As <HI>Finns</HI> are the
<HI>Fi&s;hes Oars,</HI> &s;o <HI>Oars</HI> are the <HI>Boats Finns,</HI> by
help whereof &s;he makes her way: Now, to
&s;upply this defect, we took <HI>two Pipe-&s;taves,</HI> and
&s;litting them a cro&s;s from corner to corner with
a Hand-&s;aw, we made of each Pipe-&s;taff two
Rude things, which Nece&s;&s;ity was plea&s;ed to
entitle <HI>The blades for a pair of Oars,</HI> and the&s;e
were ea&s;ily conveyed out, without &s;u&s;pition.</P>
<P>Next, we con&s;idered, that <HI>Provi&s;ion</HI> mu&s;t be
laid in for <HI>our Voyage;</HI> and therefore we provi|ded
<HI>a &s;mall,</HI> and but <HI>a &s;mall quantity of Bread,</HI>
pre&s;uming our &s;tay at Sea mu&s;t be but &s;hort;
for either we &s;hould &s;peedily <HI>recover Land,</HI> or
&s;peedily <HI>be drown'd,</HI> or &s;peedily be <HI>brought back
again:</HI> Two Goats &s;kins al&s;o, &s;tript off whole,
and &s;o Tann'd (a kind of Bottle much u&s;ed by
the <HI>Algerines</HI> to carry Milk and Water in) we

<P>We remembred al&s;o that <HI>a Sail</HI> might be of
right good u&s;e to us <HI>for expedition,</HI> and there|fore
<PB N="58" REF="48">
we bought as much <HI>Canvas</HI> as would <HI>An|&s;wer
that End;</HI> and when &s;ome Di&s;pute was
made abou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> carrying it out, I Offered to under|take
<HI>that la&s;t part of our work:</HI> I had not gone
a quarter of a Mile, but as I ca&s;t my wary eye
back, I e&s;pyed <HI>the &s;ame &s;pie,</HI> who once before
had &s;eized me, and given me trouble, follow|ing
me very roundly. My Heart began to ake;
I was loth <HI>a De&s;ign of &s;o near, and dear con|cernment
to all of us,</HI> &s;hould be <HI>brought to the
Birth, and there &s;hould be no &s;trength to bring

<HI>in the Haven,</HI> but me-thought it was <HI>more &s;ad</HI>
to <HI>&s;ink a Ve&s;&s;el before it could be Launched:</HI> And
here I fir&s;t found the difference between <HI>Inno|cence

&s;in <HI>there</HI> which are not &s;o in <HI>other places:)</HI> and
this had betray'd me, had I not &s;uddenly pluckt
up my &s;pirits, and &s;pying an <HI>Engli&s;h-man</HI> wa&s;h|ing

Heads to watch our motions: As &s;oon as we had
<HI>a little formally</HI> wa&s;h'd it, to ca&s;t a Mi&s;t before
his Ob&s;erving Eyes, I took the Canvas and &s;pred

it before his Face upon the top of the Rock to
dry; he &s;taid his own Time, and then march'd
off. But I was as Jealous of him, as he could
be of me for his Heart; and therefore fearing
he might lye in Ambu&s;h for me, took it when
'twas dry, and very fairly carried it back into
the City, and faithfully acquainted my Accom|plices
how the Matter &s;quared. This Di&s;cora|ged
them not a little, for that they &s;eemed timo|rous
to proceed in the Enterprize.</P>
<P>At la&s;t we comforted, and encouraged one

we &s;hould <HI>meet that Night?</HI> At <HI>what time?</HI>
Where we &s;hould <HI>put our Boat together,</HI> and
where <HI>put to Sea?</HI> The Time was an hour with|in
Night; the Rendevouz on <HI>a Hill,</HI> about
half a Mile from the Sea; and &s;o we di&s;per&s;ed,
&s;ome one way, &s;ome another; and privily lurk|ing

<P>There is one thing that the Reader will be

him for a &s;pecial Rea&s;on: <HI>viz.</HI> What I
did with my Shop and Goods? When I had once
Re&s;olved upon this Adventure, and &s;aw it go on
hopefully, I gave my Patron my wonted Vi&s;its;
kept fair Corre&s;pondence, paid him his demands
duly, but &s;ecretly I made off my Goods as fa&s;t
as I could, and turn'd all into ready Money: I
had a Trunk, for which <HI>John Anthony</HI> made me
<HI>a fal&s;e bottom;</HI> into which I put what Silver or
<PB N="60" REF="49">
Gold I had? and into the Body of the Trunk,
what ever it would <HI>hold,</HI> and was <HI>worthy holding:</HI>
This Trunk I committed privately to the Fide|lity
of our dear Mini&s;ter, Mr. <HI>Sprat;</HI> he took the
charge of it, and he was now ready to receive
his full Di&s;charge. This Trunk he <HI>Faithfully

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The putting off our Boat together, the Dif|ficulties
we met with therein; and our
putting out to Sea, June 30. 1644.</HEAD>
<P>AS &s;oon as we were met all together at the
appointed place; we began to think of Ex|ecuting
our long intended De&s;ign; but we were
divided in our Coun&s;els, where to begin our
work: It had been a Que&s;tion propounded be|fore,
and <HI>we thought</HI> we had fully re&s;olved upon
<HI>the place;</HI> but at our Meeting we were <HI>&s;trangely
di&s;compo&s;ed:</HI> There were <HI>two places</HI> which &s;tood
in Competition, each pretending good Conve|niences
for that end. The one was <HI>a Hill,</HI> about
half a Mile from the Sea; the other was <HI>a Val|ley,</HI>
encompa&s;&s;ed with two Hedges, about a
Furlong from the Hill, but of the &s;ame di&s;tance
with it from the Sea: It was urged for the Val|ley,
that it was a place of <HI>more Secrecy and Pri|vacy,</HI>
le&s;s obvious to view; but then it was ob|jected,
that we might there <HI>be &s;urprized, and
&s;eized</HI> by the Churches of our Enemies, e're we
could have notice to &s;hift for our &s;elves: For the
Hill, it had been argued, that we might there
<HI>make better Di&s;covery</HI> of Danger, and <HI>make
Provi&s;ion to avoyd it;</HI> and in &s;hort, we all agreed
<PB N="62" REF="50">
<HI>over night,</HI> to put our Boat together <HI>upon the
Hill;</HI> promi&s;ing our &s;elves much Advantage
from <HI>its Scituation:</HI> But when we were met,
we all altered our Re&s;olution <HI>without any vi&s;ible
Rea&s;on,</HI> and carried it for the Valley&punc; God is
much <HI>in the dark to us,</HI> but all our wayes <HI>are in
the open Light to him.</HI> It's very difficult to give
an Account <HI>what God is doing at pre&s;ent,</HI> but we
&s;hall know, if we can but patiently wait till <HI>fu|ture
Providences</HI> Comment upon <HI>the former:</HI>
And in a while we &s;aw the Rea&s;on why God
over-ruled our purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>We had hid &s;everal of our Materials near <HI>the
top of the Hill,</HI> where al&s;o grew a &s;mall Fig-tree,
which we had marked with our Eye, as Judging
it would be u&s;eful to &s;trengthen the Keel of our
Boat: Two of our Company were immediately
di&s;patcht to <HI>&s;aw down this Fig-Tree,</HI> and bring
it, and the parcels of our Boat there di&s;po&s;ited
away with them: They were hardly come to
the place, but we heard Dogs bark about the
top of the Hill, and indeed two Men with Dogs
came very near them; but our Men being aware
lay clo&s;e and &s;till, and &s;o they pa&s;&s;ed by with|out
making any Di&s;covery, and then our Men
be&s;tirr'd them&s;elves, and brought away the
Fig-Tree, and the other Materials, and retur|ned
to us.</P>
<P>And now we had once more brought the &s;cat|ter'd
Limbs of our Boat into one place, which,
like tho&s;e of <HI>Ab&s;yrtus,</HI> had been di&s;per&s;ed up
<PB N="63" REF="50">
and down the Fields: It was no time to trifle,
&amp; therefore we all buckled to our work in good
earne&s;t: But we were &s;o nigh &s;ome that were at
work in the Neighbouring Gardens, that we
could hear them &s;peak, and therefore mu&s;t needs
&s;uppo&s;e they might hear us too; and therefore
we Acted by Signs, and pointed, and pulled,
and nodded, but were <HI>all Mutes:</HI> It might have
been an Expedient for the Builders of <HI>Babel,</HI>
when their Languages were Divided, to have
carried on their great Project by Signs: but cer|tainly
there was Confu&s;ion poured out <HI>upon their
Hearts and Coun&s;els,</HI> as well as Divi&s;ion in <HI>their
Tongues and Languages.</HI></P>
<P>The two parts of our Keel we &s;oon joyned;
then opening the Timbers, which had already
<HI>one Nail in every Joynt,</HI> we groped out for <HI>the
other hole;</HI> and put <HI>its Nail</HI> into it: Then we
open'd them at their full length, and applyed
them to the top of the Keel, fa&s;tning them with
<HI>Rope-Yarn,</HI> and &s;mall Cords; and &s;o we &s;erved
all the Joynts to keep them <HI>firm and &s;table;</HI> then
we bound <HI>&s;mall Canes</HI> all along the Ribs <HI>length-ways,</HI>
both to keep the Ribs <HI>from vering,</HI> and
al&s;o <HI>to bear out the Canvas very &s;tiff again&s;t the
pre&s;&s;ing water:</HI> Then we made <HI>Notches</HI> upon
the ends of the <HI>Ribs, or Timbers,</HI> wherein <HI>the
Oars might plye;</HI> and having tyed down the Seats,
and &s;trengthned our Keel with the Fig-Tree, we
la&s;tly drew on our double Canvas Ca&s;e, <HI>already
fitted;</HI> and really <HI>the Canvas</HI> &s;eemed a <HI>Winding-&s;heet
<PB N="64" REF="51">
&s;heet for our Boat;</HI> and our <HI>Boat a Coffin for
us all.</HI></P>
<P>This done, four of our Company took it upon
their &s;houlders, and carried it down towards the
Sea, which was about half a Mile off: It was
a little Repre&s;entation of a <HI>Funeral,</HI> to &s;ee <HI>the
four Barers</HI> Marching in deep &s;ilence with &s;ome|thing
very like <HI>a Her&s;e, and Coffin,</HI> upon their
&s;houlders, and the re&s;t of us <HI>decently attending
the Ceremony;</HI> but we <HI>wanted Torches,</HI> and be|&s;ides,
it's not u&s;ual for <HI>any</HI> to wait upon <HI>their own
Coffins:</HI> But we dur&s;t not grudg our Boat that
<HI>&s;mall, and la&s;t Office,</HI> to carry it <HI>half a Mile,</HI>
for we expected, it &s;hould repay us that Ser|vice
and Civilty with Intere&s;t, in carrying us
<HI>many a League:</HI> We carried it at Land, where
it could <HI>not &s;wim;</HI> that it might carry us at Sea,
where we could <HI>not walk.</HI> As we went along,
they that were in the Gardens heard us pa&s;&s;ing
by, and called to us, <HI>who comes there?</HI> But it
was dark, and we had no mind to prate, and
therefore without any An&s;wer, we &s;ilently held
on our way.</P>
<P>When we came to the Sea-&s;ide, we immedi|ately
&s;tript our&s;elves naked, and putting our
Clothes into the Boat, carried it, and them, as
far into the Sea as we could wade; and this we
did, le&s;t <HI>our tender Boat</HI> &s;hould pe <HI>toren again&s;t
the Stones or Rocks;</HI> and then all &s;even of us
got into her: But here we &s;oon found how our
Skill in Calculating the Lading of our Ve&s;&s;el
failed
<PB N="65" REF="51">
us: For we were no &s;ooner Embarqued,
but &s;he was ready to &s;ink under us, the water
coming in over the &s;ides? &s;o that once again we
mu&s;t entertain new Coun&s;els&punc; at la&s;t, one <HI>who&s;e
Heart mo&s;t failed him,</HI> was willing to be &s;hut out;
and rather hazard the <HI>uncertain Torments of the
Land,</HI> than <HI>certainly be drown'd at Sea;</HI> then
we made a &s;econd Experiment, but &s;till &s;he was
&s;o deep Laden, that we all concluded there was
no venturing out to Sea: At length, <HI>another</HI>
went a &s;hore, and then &s;he <HI>held up her Head</HI> ve|ry
&s;toutly, and &s;eem'd <HI>hearty enough</HI> for our
Voyage.</P>
<P>It was time now to commit, and Commend
our &s;elves, and Ve&s;&s;el to the Protection, and
Conduct of that God <HI>who Rules the Winds and
the waves, and who&s;e Kingdom is in the deep
Waters, imploring Mercy for the Pardon of our

for Six Dayes, and Nights, with the Co|incident
Providences of God that ap|peared
for us in our Extremities, and
our Miraculous Landing at Mayork,
July 6. 1644.</HEAD>
<P>WE are now out at Sea without Helm, or
Pilot; without Anchor, Tackle, or
Compa&s;s; but God was <HI>the&s;e. all the&s;e, and
more then all the&s;e.</HI> Our Number was <HI>Small,</HI>
our Work was <HI>Great,</HI> we could not afford one
<HI>Idle Hand,</HI> not one idle <HI>Finger:</HI> Four of the
Company continually wrought at the Oars; and
indeed we <HI>wrought for our Lives,</HI> and then I
&s;hall not need to &s;ay <HI>how we wrought:</HI> But this
<HI>I &s;hall</HI> &s;ay, I <HI>can truly</HI> &s;ay it, I never &s;aw &s;trength
<HI>&s;o &s;trained,</HI> nor the utmo&s;t of what <HI>Nature
could do</HI> for <HI>Life and Liberty,</HI> exerted &s;o much
in all my Life. The Employment of the fifth
Man was <HI>more ea&s;ie,</HI> but no le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary, which
was to free the Boat of that water, which by
Degrees leak't through our Canvas.</P>
<P>We Labour'd the harder <HI>that Night,</HI> becau&s;e
we would gladly be out of the Ken of our Old
<PB N="68" REF="54">
Ma&s;ters <HI>by Day;</HI> but when Day appear'd, we
were yet within &s;ight of the Ships that lay in the
Haven, and Road, and off the Land: But our
Boat being &s;mall, and lying clo&s;e, and &s;nug up|on
the Sea, either was not at all di&s;covered, or
el&s;e &s;eemed &s;omething that was not worth the
taking up: A <HI>little hope</HI> in the mid&s;t of <HI>great
Fears,</HI> made us double, and re-double our Di|ligence;
we tugg'd at the Oars like tho&s;e who
are <HI>Chain'd to the Gallies,</HI> becau&s;e we had no
mind to be <HI>Slaves</HI> to our Old Patrones in <HI>their
Gallies.</HI></P>
<P>But upon all Occa&s;ions we found our want of
fore-ca&s;t, for now our Bread, which was to be
the &s;taff of our decayed &s;trength, had lie &s;oak|ing
in the Salt water, like a drunken Toa&s;t &s;opt
in Brine, and was quite &s;poiled: And our fre&s;h
water in the Bottles &s;tank of the Tann'd Skins,
and Owze, having lye &s;obbing in the Salt water
which made it nauceous: But yet that hope that
hover'd over us, and flatter'd us that we &s;hould
one day mend our Commons, &s;weeten'd all a|gain;
<HI>&s;o long as Bread was Bread,</HI> we com|plained
not: Three days with good Husbandry
it la&s;ted, but then pale Famine (which is the
wor&s;t &s;heap Death can be painted in) &s;tared us
in the Face; And there was no &s;ub&s;titute for
Bread at Sea: At Land, the Roots of Gra&s;s the
tops of Trees, and the vile&s;t Excrements have
&s;erved to &s;top the clamour of a Ravenous Sto|mach,
but that which Slaves de&s;pi&s;ed, we &s;hould
<PB N="69" REF="54">
have admired, and prized: Water indeed we
might have, <HI>either cold, or hot;</HI> we had choice,
but it was <HI>a hard choice:</HI> Either the <HI>cold &s;alt
weter</HI> out of the Sea, or <HI>that warmer</HI> which
had been &s;trained through our Bodies, and that
we cho&s;e <HI>of the two,</HI> but we mu&s;t not have that,
<HI>after a while,</HI> unle&s;s we would fir&s;t accept <HI>the
other:</HI> And the Mi&s;ery was, the&s;e did not <HI>a&s;|&s;wage</HI>
our thir&s;t, but <HI>increa&s;e it;</HI> nor <HI>increa&s;e
our &s;trength,</HI> but <HI>dimini&s;h it;</HI> yet the&s;e were
the <HI>means of Life:</HI> Strange means, that would
de&s;troy <HI>the End.</HI></P>
<P>Several things added to our Mi&s;ery; for trou|ble
&s;eldom comes &s;olitary: For fir&s;t, we had
the Wind <HI>for &s;ome time</HI> full again&s;t us: And this
was both an evil in <HI>its &s;elf,</HI> an evil in <HI>its effect,</HI>
and an evil <HI>in its cau&s;e.</HI> It was a great evil <HI>in it
&s;elf;</HI> it <HI>increa&s;ed</HI> our Labour, and then <HI>defeated
it:</HI> We Rowed <HI>harder</HI> to <HI>le&s;s purpo&s;e:</HI> we <HI>mo|ved,</HI>
but did not <HI>advance!</HI> we <HI>&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ent our &s;trength
for nought, and in vain.</HI> It was an <HI>evil in its
effect;</HI> for it engaged <HI>the Waters</HI> again&s;t us, and
drew them into <HI>its prey,</HI> The Sea is <HI>a perfect
Neuter</HI> of it &s;elf, and willing to maintain <HI>its
Neutrality;</HI> but the powerful Winds drew her
<HI>into the Faction:</HI> And that Sea which &s;erves <HI>the
North</HI> to day, &s;hall comply with the <HI>more pre|vailing
South</HI> to Morrow; for <HI>the Waves are
the greate&s;t time-&s;ervers</HI> in the World: But it
was far the greate&s;t <HI>evil in its Cau&s;e;</HI> for the
<HI>Winds being again&s;t us,</HI> argued that <HI>God was
<PB N="70" REF="55">
again&s;t us;</HI> for the Wind we know was <HI>his:
He brings the Winds out of his Magazines.</HI> We
were now &s;o di&s;pirited, that we debated, <HI>whe|ther
we &s;hould bare up with the Wind, or make
the be&s;t of our way, and Row again&s;t it?</HI> That
is, whether it were not better to go back to <HI>Al|gires
with ea&s;e,</HI> then <HI>painfully</HI> make towards
<HI>Freedom?</HI> At la&s;t like Per&s;ons that though we
knew not what to do, yet re&s;olved not to return;
we re&s;olved whil&s;t we had Life, and &s;trength,
and Breath, we would &s;truggle with it: And
now the great God interpo&s;ed; he rebuked <HI>his
Wind;</HI> it was <HI>not again&s;t us;</HI> nay he <HI>reconciled</HI>
his Wind, and it became <HI>our Friend.</HI> He that
can turn the <HI>Rivers in the South,</HI> could turn <HI>the
Winds out of the North:</HI> Here we might have
had a notable demon&s;tration of Gods Soverign|ty.
He determined the <HI>Quarter</HI> of the Wind,
the <HI>Quantity</HI> of the Wind, and the <HI>Continuance</HI>
of the Wind. The Quarter, <HI>whence</HI> it &s;hould
blow The; Quantity, <HI>how much</HI> it &s;hould blow,
and the Continuance, <HI>how long it &s;hould blow.</HI>
The Quarter was our Enemy, the Continuance
had quite brought us to De&s;pair; but had he
opened his Hand, and let out <HI>one bla&s;t more,</HI> the
proud <HI>Waters had gone over our Souls, we had
peri&s;hed in the deep:</HI> But we &s;ee that <HI>our times
are in Gods Hand;</HI> the Ocean in the <HI>hollow of
the &s;ame Hand,</HI> and the Winds <HI>in the &s;ame hand;</HI>
and Happy it was for us, that <HI>we, and they,
were all there.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="55">
A Second great Inconveniency was, that <HI>our
Labour was without Intermi&s;&s;ion,</HI> though we ad|vanced
<HI>not forwards</HI> at many &s;troaks, yet ce&s;&s;a|tion
had driven us <HI>backwards.</HI> The poor Sen|tinel
that &s;tands upon the Watch, yet comforts
him&s;elf that another will Relive him; but we
had none to take the toyl off our Hands, and
give us Re&s;pite: We might <HI>&s;hift our places, but
not our pains.</HI></P>
<P>A Third great Evil that lay &s;ore upon us, was
the extremity of the <HI>heat by day;</HI> the Sea&s;on
was Raging hot, being the beginning of <HI>July;</HI>
the Climent was hot, being under, or about the
Fourth Climate; we wanted fre&s;h Water to
cool the Heat, and were engagad in continual
Labour to <HI>enrage the heat,</HI> and all the&s;e made it
in&s;upportable to <HI>our Bodies,</HI> and our <HI>little, or
no hope,</HI> (which now like a Candle burnt down
to the Socket, did rather blink, than burn) made
it <HI>grievous to our Souls.</HI> One &s;mall help we had
(if it was a help) that the fifth Man, who emp|tyed
the Boat of the Salt Water, threw it upon
the Bodies of the re&s;t to cool them; But this was
<HI>a Mi&s;erable Remedy,</HI> for our Bodies were &s;o
bleached between the &s;corching Sun, and the
cooling Water, that they ro&s;e up in Bli&s;ters all
over. Great pain we felt, great danger we were
in, great Mi&s;eries were endured, great wants
we were under, and had <HI>nothing little,</HI> but <HI>hope,
food, and &s;trength.</HI> By Day we were all &s;tark
Naked, by Night we had our Shirts, or loo&s;e
<PB N="72" REF="56">
Coats, and that was all our Cloathing, the re&s;t
we left a &s;hore to ea&s;e our Boat.</P>
<P>If any &s;hall be &s;o Inqui&s;itive, as to ask, <HI>by
what Directions</HI> we &s;teared our Cour&s;e, that we
did not tack about in&s;en&s;ibly in the dark Night
or Day? He may know, that for <HI>the Day,</HI> one
of the Company had <HI>a Pocket-Dyal,</HI> which &s;up|plyed
the place of the Compa&s;s, ee'n well e|nough
for &s;uch a Ve&s;&s;el, and &s;uch Mariners. By
Night when <HI>the Stars appeared,</HI> we had our
advice from them, and when they di&s;-appeared,
we ghe&s;&s;ed at our way by <HI>the Motions of the
Clouds.</HI></P>
<P>In this &s;ad &amp; woeful plight we continued four
Dayes and Nights; on the fifth Day, we were
<HI>on the brink of the brink of de&s;pair,</HI> and all
hope that we &s;hould be &s;aved, utterly peri&s;hed.
And now, as per&s;ons de&s;pairing of <HI>the End,</HI> we
cea&s;ed to pur&s;ue <HI>the means;</HI> laid by our Oars,
left off our Labour; either we had no &s;trength
left, or were loth to throw away that little we
had to no purpo&s;e, only we kept &s;till emptying
the Boat; loth to drown, loth to dye, yet knew
no wayes to avoyd Death: When the <HI>End is re|moved,</HI>
all <HI>means peri&s;h</HI> with it.</P>
<P>They that act lea&s;t, commonly wi&s;h the mo&s;t:
thus when we had left <HI>fruitle&s;s Labour,</HI> we fell
upon <HI>fruitle&s;s wi&s;hes,</HI> that we might meet with
&s;ome Ve&s;&s;el, &s;ome Ship to take us up&punc; If it
was <HI>but a Ship,</HI> we con&s;idered <HI>no further; Eng|li&s;h,
or African, Tro&s;s, Tyriu&s;ve;</HI> all was a
<PB N="73" REF="56">
Ca&s;e: Or if not, yet <HI>the wor&s;t was better than
our bad ca&s;e;</HI> and therefore re&s;olved, could we

us, I know not; but to that pa&s;s were we
now brought, that we would have accepted Life
upon any terms, <HI>not ba&s;e and &s;inful;</HI> and whether
we &s;hould have &s;tuck <HI>at &s;uch or no,</HI> I have no &s;uch
&s;ecurity from my own Heart as to re&s;olve
him.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t we were at <HI>this dead Ebbe</HI> of Hope,
the Great God, who&s;e mo&s;t Glorious <HI>Opportu|nity</HI>
to help, is his Creatures <HI>greate&s;t Extremi|ty:</HI>
He that appeared for <HI>Abraham in the
Mount,</HI> and to the <HI>three Young Men in the Fie|ry

at the Red Sea;</HI> he who times all his Mercies
for their Advantage: even He &s;ent us &s;ome Re|lief,
and a <HI>little Relief</HI> is <HI>great,</HI> in <HI>great exigen|cies.</HI>
As we lay hulling up and down, we Di&s;|covered
a Tortoi&s;e not far from us a&s;leep in the
Sea. Had the great <HI>Drake</HI> Di&s;covered the <HI>Spa|ni&s;h
<PB N="74" REF="57">
Plate-Fleet,</HI> he could not have more Re|joyced;
once again we bethought our &s;elves of
our Oars; and now our little Boat &s;hewed it
&s;elf to be of <HI>the right breed of Algiers,</HI> made of
<HI>Piratick Timber,</HI> and to its poor Abbility would
become <HI>a Cor&s;air;</HI> we &s;ilently Rowed to our
Prey, took it into the Boat with great Triumph,
we cut off her Head, and let her bleed into a
Pot; we drank the Blood, eat the Liver,
and &s;uck'd the Fle&s;h; <HI>warm Fle&s;h, and hot Li|quor</HI>
(except our own) had been <HI>a great Ra|rity</HI>
with us a long time, it was a Novelty of
Providence; and really it wonderfully refre&s;h'd
our Spirits, repaired our decayed &s;trength and
recruited Nature; at lea&s;t, poor exhau&s;ted Na|ture
was willing to be cheated, and fancy her
&s;elf recruited: But there was no cheat in't we
were really refre&s;h'd, and with fre&s;h vigour and
courage fell to our Work; we left our fears be|hind
us, we pickt up &s;ome &s;catter'd crumbs of
hope, and about Noon, we Di&s;covered, or
thought we Di&s;covered Land. It's impo&s;&s;ible
to expre&s;s the Joy, and Triumph of our rai&s;ed
Souls at this apprehen&s;ion. The Poets tell us,
that as often as <HI>Hercules</HI> threw the great Giant
again&s;t <HI>the Earth,</HI> his <HI>Mother Earth</HI> gave him
<HI>new &s;trength</HI> again&s;t the next Encounter: It was
<HI>new &s;trength, new Life</HI> to us, though <HI>not to touch</HI>
yet <HI>to &s;ee;</HI> or if <HI>not to &s;ee,</HI> to <HI>think we &s;aw</HI> it.
It brought fre&s;h Blood into our Veins, fre&s;h co|our
into our pale Cheeks; we look'd <HI>not</HI> like
<PB N="75" REF="57">
Men awaked from &s;leep, <HI>not</HI> like Captives broke
from the Chains of <HI>Algiers,</HI> but like Per&s;ons
<HI>rai&s;ed from the Dead.</HI> But <HI>Hope and Fear
made a &s;trange Medly Pa&s;sion in our Souls;</HI> like
the Reparties of two contrary jo&s;tling Tides, or
the &s;truggling of the Eddy with the main Stream;
Hope would per&s;wade us that we &s;aw the Land;
but chill Fear bad us pau&s;e upon it, for as we
ea&s;ily believe, what we de&s;ire to be true, &s;o
we are as ready to fear le&s;t it &s;hould not prove
true; for fear had got long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our
Souls, and would hardly admit Hope to &s;tir, but
was ready to &s;uppre&s;s it as a di&s;turber of its
Empire: We had &s;een nothing but Air, and
Sea; Sea, and Air in five Dayes and Nights;
that though our Rea&s;on tould us there was &s;uch a
thing as Land, yet the Impre&s;&s;ions that fear had
made upon us, made it Que&s;tionable, whether
ever we &s;hould &s;ee it. And we dur&s;t not give
too much Credence to our Eyes, that had been
u&s;ed to bring &s;adder &s;tories to our Hearts.</P>
<P>Yet &s;till we wrought hard: Hope did us that
kindne&s;s it put us upon an earne&s;t de&s;ire to &s;ee,
whether we were deceived or no. After &s;ome
further Labour, we grew more confident, and
at la&s;t, fully &s;atisfied that it was Land: I hope
I &s;hall never foeget what a &s;en&s;e we had of Gods
goodne&s;s upon that A&s;&s;urance. Extreams do
equally annoy, and &s;ometimes infatuate the
mind: They tell us, that in <HI>Greenland,</HI> the ex|tremity
of Cold will make the Iron &s;tick to the
<PB N="76" REF="58">
Fingers, as our Experience a&s;&s;ures extremity of
Heat will do; for now like Di&s;tracted Per&s;ons,
we all leapt into the Sea, quitting our Boat, and
being all good Swimmers, we there Bathed, and
cooled our heated Bodies. An Adventure,
which, if well con&s;idered, had as much of the
De&s;perado in it as our putting to Sea: For now
we were at the Mercy of the Sharks; which
might have &s;heared off a Leg, or Arm; and now
our over-heated Bodies were open to receive the
Impre&s;&s;ions of that Cold Element: But as we
never con&s;idered our Danger, the great and
good God delivered us from the Ordinary ef|fects
of &s;uch Folly; we pre&s;ently returned to
our Boat, and being both wearied with Labour,
and cooled a little with the Sea, we lay us all
down to Sleep in as much &s;ecurity, as if we had
been in our own Beds: Nature being almo&s;t
&s;pent, mu&s;t have a Truce; &s;he will not under|take
to keep our Bodies upon their Legs, if we
will not &s;ubmit to her great &s;tanding Ordi|nance
of Re&s;t; and here we &s;aw &s;till more of
Divine Goodne&s;s, that our Leaky Ve&s;&s;el did not
bury us in the Sea, and we awaking find our
&s;elves in the other World: But he that <HI>gave us
Sleep, mea&s;ured it;</HI> and he mea&s;ured it <HI>exactly,</HI>
not &s;uffering us to <HI>out-&s;leep the Sea&s;on</HI> of plying
our Pump, or that which &s;upplyed the place of
it.</P>
<P>Being thus refre&s;h'd with &s;leep, we found <HI>new
&s;trength</HI> for our Work, and God found us <HI>new
<PB N="77" REF="58">
Work</HI> for our &s;trength: We tugged the harder
at the Oar, becau&s;e we hoped e'er Night to &s;leep
upon a more &s;table, and faithful Element. But
we made our way very &s;lowly, and when we
ca&s;t up the Account of our Progre&s;s, found that
we had gone but <HI>little way in a long time;</HI> to|wards
Evening we di&s;covered another I&s;land:
The fir&s;t we &s;aw was <HI>Mayork,</HI> the &s;econd,
<HI>Fromentere;</HI> and &s;ome of our Company that
had Sailed in the&s;e Seas, would undertake to a&s;|&s;ure
us of it: We debated not long to which
of the&s;e we &s;hould direct our Cour&s;e, for the
latter being much infe&s;ted with venemous Ser|pents,
and little, if at all Inhabited, we re&s;ol|ved
all for <HI>Mayork:</HI> All that Night we Rowed
very hard, and the next, being the &s;ixth of <HI>July,</HI>
and from our putting to Sea; we kept within
&s;ight of it all Day, and about Ten a Clock at
Night we came under the I&s;land, but the Rocks
were there &s;o craggy, and &s;teep, that we could
not climb up.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t we were under the&s;e Rocks there
came a Ve&s;&s;el, very near us. Let the Reader put
him&s;elf in our &s;tead, let him but Copy out our
Thoughts, let him imagine how loth we were
to lo&s;e all our toil and Travel, to forego our De|liverance,
to have this Rich Mercy, which God
had put into our Hands, wre&s;ted out of them
again by &s;ome <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Pickaroon, or <HI>Cor&s;air,</HI>
that are alwayes skimming tho&s;e Seas: It con|cerned
us therefore to lye clo&s;e, and when they
<PB N="78" REF="59">
were pa&s;&s;ed by, we gently crept along the Coa&s;t
as near the &s;hoar as we dur&s;t, till we found a
convenient place, where we might thru&s;t in our
Weather-beaten Boat.</P>
<P>If the&s;e Papers &s;hould fall into the hands of

But I can be content to be Accounted

Language of the Sea, yet have found her Bil|lows
deaf to their Cries and Prayers, and their
&s;tately Ships made the Scorn of Winds, and the
Reproach of Waves, when we, who had none

<P>WHen we were come to Land, we were
not un&s;en&s;ible of our Deliverance,
though like Men newly awakened out of a
Dream, we had not the true Dimen&s;ions of it;
We confe&s;&s;ed God had done <HI>great things</HI> for us,
but <HI>how great</HI> things he had done was beyond
our Comprehen&s;ion: We had <HI>e&s;caped the Sea,</HI>
but yet Death might be found <HI>at Land;</HI> and we
were ready to &s;ay, with <HI>Samp&s;on,</HI> Judg. 15. 18.
<HI>Lord, thou ha&s;t given this great Deliverance
into the hands of thy Servants, and now &s;hall we
dye for Thir&s;t?</HI> We had had no Food &s;ince we
eat the Liver, and drank the Blood of the Tor|toi&s;e,
and therefore leaving three of our Com|pany
with the Boat, the other too, <HI>viz. John

abroad for fre&s;h Water: And the rather were
we &s;ent, becau&s;e this <HI>John Anthony</HI> could &s;peak
both the <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI> Tongues very
perfectly; and I had as much of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> as
might &s;erve to expre&s;s our wants, and de&s;ires,
if perhaps we might meet with any per&s;ons there
<PB N="80" REF="60">
abouts. We were not far gone, before we fell
into a Wood, and we were in a Wilderne&s;s in
our thoughts, which way to take: He will needs
go his way, and I mine. Good Lord! what a
frail impotent thing is Man! That they whom
common dangers <HI>by Sea,</HI> common Deliverances
<HI>from Sea</HI> had United, &s;hould now about our
own wills fall out at Land. And yet thus we
did: He gave me reproachful words, and it's
well we came not to blows: But I went my own
way, and he &s;eeing me re&s;olute, <HI>followed me,</HI>
and the Providence of God, not dealing with us
according to our frowardne&s;s, <HI>followed us both:</HI>
This way led us to a Watch-Tower of the <HI>Spani|ards</HI>
many of which they keep upon the Sea-Coa&s;ts,
to give the Countrey timely notice of
any Pickaroons that come a&s;hoar to Rob, and
Spoyl.</P>
<P>When we came within call, fearing he might
Di&s;charge at us, we &s;poke to him upon the
Watch, told him our Condition, what we
were, whence we came, how we e&s;caped; and
earne&s;tly begged of him to direct us to &s;ome fre&s;h

and not <HI>a &s;tone,</HI> nor <HI>a Bullet,</HI> Hunger did not
con&s;ider it's <HI>Mouldine&s;s:</HI> Then he directed us
to fre&s;h Water, which was hard by? We &s;tood
not telling Stories; we remembred <HI>our &s;elves,</HI>
<PB N="81" REF="60">
we remembred <HI>our Brethren</HI> left with our Boat,
and ob&s;erving the Sentinels Directions, came
to a Well, where there was a Pot with &s;trings
to draw with: We drank a little Water, and
eat a bit of our Cake, but the pa&s;&s;age was &s;o
di&s;-u&s;ed, that we had much ado to force our
Throats to relieve our clamourous &s;tomachs:
But here we &s;taid not, but, with the four Le|pers
in the Tents of the <HI>Syrians,</HI> 2 Kings 7. 9.
Rebuked our &s;elves, <HI>We do not well, we have

We return to our Boat, are welcomed by our
Companions, acquaint them with the good &s;uc|ce&s;s
of our Emba&s;&s;y, and all prepare to make
to the Well.</P>
<P>And now <HI>we mu&s;t leave our Boat;</HI> that <HI>faith|ful
In&s;trument</HI> of God's Providence, which had
<HI>&s;o tru&s;tily &s;erved his purpo&s;e</HI> to deliver us: It was
not without &s;ome recoylings upon our Spirits,
that we &s;hould &s;o much as in appearance <HI>imitate
the ingratitude</HI> of tho&s;e, who having &s;erved their
private ends on their Friends, and have now no
further u&s;e of them, mo&s;t ungratefully &s;hake
them off: That we &s;hould be like <HI>the water-dog,</HI>
which u&s;es the water to pur&s;ue his Game; and
when he comes to Land, &s;hakes it off as <HI>trouble|&s;ome,
and burden&s;ome.</HI> But it was no time to
&s;tand upon Complements; Hunger, Thir&s;t,
Wearine&s;s, de&s;ire of Refre&s;hment and Re&s;t&punc;
tho&s;e <HI>importunate Duns,</HI> Commanded us away;
<PB N="82" REF="61">
and tying our Boat as fa&s;t as we could to the
Shoar, we left her <HI>to Mercy,</HI> which had been <HI>&s;o
good</HI> to us.</P>
<P>As we were going, or rather creeping, or
crawling towards the Well, another Quarrel
&s;tarted among&s;t us, the Memory whereof is
&s;o ungrateful, that I &s;hall give it a Burial in &s;i|lence,

<P>And now we are at <HI>the Well,</HI> and the Well is
<HI>provided of Water,</HI> and we have <HI>&s;omething to
draw;</HI> all <HI>the&s;e helps</HI> God has given us, but he
mu&s;t give us <HI>one more,</HI> even <HI>a throat to &s;wallow</HI>
it, without which, all the re&s;t <HI>&s;ignifie nothing.</HI>
This was the evil Di&s;ea&s;e <HI>Solomon</HI> had ob&s;erved
in his Daies, <HI>Eccle&s;. 6. 2. A Man to whom
God had given Riches, Wealth, and Honour,
&s;o that he wanteth nothing for his Soul, of all
that he de&s;ireth; yet God giveth him not Power
to eat thereof:</HI> He that gives us <HI>water to drink,
and meat to eat,</HI> mu&s;t give us <HI>Power to eat and
drink</HI> al&s;o. How totally do we depend upon
him for Life, and Breath, and all things! One
of our Company, <HI>William Adams,</HI> attempting
to drink, after many E&s;&s;ays was not able to &s;wal|low
it, but &s;till the water returned, &s;o that he
&s;unk down to the Ground, faintly &s;aying, <HI>I am
a dead Man?</HI> we <HI>forgot</HI> our &s;elves, to <HI>remember
him,</HI> and after much &s;triving, and forcing, he
took a little; and when he and we were refre&s;h'd
<PB N="83" REF="61">
with our Cake and water, we lay down by the
Well-&s;ide till the Morning. None of us could
<HI>watch for the re&s;t,</HI> but <HI>One God watched over us
all:</HI> There we lay lockt up, and buried in
Sleep: The Heavens covered us, when we wan|ted
a Canopy: Each might &s;ay in the Morning,
with <HI>David, P&s;al. 3. 5. I laid me down and &s;lept;
I awaked, for the Lord &s;u&s;tained me.</HI></P>
<P>When it was clear day, we addre&s;t our &s;elves
once more to the man upon the watch-Tower,
entreating him to direct us the ready way to
the next Hou&s;e, or Town, where we might find
relief. He civily points us towards a Hou&s;e a|bout
two Miles off, whither, with wearied &s;teps,
and joyful Hearts, we now began to Travel:
Our Feet had been &s;o <HI>parboyled, and quodled</HI> with
the <HI>Suns heat,</HI> in the <HI>Salt-water pickle,</HI> that
they were very raw, and more bli&s;ter'd; and
long it was before we could overcome the te|diou&s;ne&s;s
of tho&s;e two Miles. When we ap|proach'd
the Hou&s;e, the Owner e&s;pying us, and
concluding by our <HI>&s;habby garb,</HI> that we were
&s;ome <HI>Pilfering Ra&s;cals,</HI> pre&s;ented a Fowling
Piece at us, and chatged us to &s;tand. The fore|mo&s;t
of our Company, who could &s;peak that
Language well, meekly told him, he might
&s;pare that Language, we were <HI>not able</HI> if we
had &s;o <HI>wicked a will;</HI> nor <HI>willing</HI> if we had been
<HI>able,</HI> to offer him the lea&s;t injury; That we
were a Company of poor Creatures, whom the
wonderful Providence of God had re&s;cued from
<PB N="84" REF="62">
he Slavery of <HI>Algiers,</HI> and hoped he would
&s;hew Mercy to the Afflicted. The hone&s;t Far|mer,
moved with our Relation, &s;ent us out
Bread, Water, and Olives, with which when
we had refre&s;h'd our &s;elves, we lay down, and
re&s;ted three or four hours in the Field; and re|turning
thanks for his Charity, prepared to crawl
away at our lame rate. He &s;eeing us thankful
Beggers, enlarged his Civility to us, called us
into his Hou&s;e, and gave us good warm Bean
Pottage, which &s;eemed to me the mo&s;t Plea&s;ant
Food that ever I eat in my Life: Our Leave
once more taken, we advanced towards the Ci|ty
of <HI>Mayork,</HI> which from this place is about ten
Miles: No water could we meet with upon our
way, but towards Evening, we di&s;coverd one
drawing water at a Well, we ha&s;ted to him,
and he drew for us; that was our Supper, and
there was our Lodging that Night.</P>
<P>The next Morning we came iuto the Suburbs
of the City, the &s;trangene&s;s of our Attire, being
bare-foot, bare-legg'd, having nothing on but
loo&s;e Coats over our Shirts; drew a croud of en|quirers
about us, who we were? whence we
came? whither we went? We gave them a
particular account of our Deliverance, with its
Circum&s;tances; and they as willing <HI>to pity,</HI> as
<HI>to know</HI> our E&s;tate, and as ready <HI>to Relieve,</HI> as
<HI>pity,</HI> accommodated us for the pre&s;ent with food;
they gave us Wine, and Strong-waters, and
whatever el&s;e might recover our exhau&s;ted Spi|rits;
<PB N="85" REF="62">
but told us, we mu&s;t be obliged to tarry
in the Suburbs, till <HI>the Vice-Roy</HI> had notice that
&s;uch &s;trangers were Arrived: He had &s;oon <HI>In|formation</HI>
of us, and we as &s;oon <HI>a Command</HI> to
appear before him: He Examined us about ma|ny
Affairs; what Men of War the <HI>Algerines</HI>
had at Sea? what &s;trength they were of at
Land? But above all, he was mo&s;t curious, and
exact in &s;atisfying him&s;elf about our E&s;cape, our
Boat, our hazzards at Sea, wherein when we
had fully obeyed him, he ordered we &s;hould
be maintained at his own Co&s;t till we could have
pa&s;&s;age to our own Country.</P>
<P>In this while the People gathered us Money
to buy us Clothes and Shooes, and we wanted
nothing that Nature called for, but <HI>thankful
Hearts to God.</HI> And they endeavoured to help
to <HI>that Mercy</HI> too: As I was walking in the
Streets viewing the City, a young Man-&s;teps to
me, Friend (&s;aid he) are you one of tho&s;e that
came lately over in the Canvas Boat? I An|&s;wered
Yes, I was one of them: well (reply|ed
the young Man) <HI>It was not the little Boat,
but the great God that brought you Over.</HI> I mu&s;t
needs &s;ay, I often think on this young man's
words, and as often as I think on them they
chide me, that I have not hitherto more pub|lickly
owned God in his Gracious and wonder|ful
Deliverance. However others may be con|cern'd

<P>After a week plea&s;ant Sailing, on the 2d. of

towards us, and &s;oon di&s;covered them to be
<HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Men of Warr, which put us into a great

unprepared we were for re&s;i&s;tance, both for our

Deck and el&s;ewhere, for a dozen Hor&s;es we
carried with us; However we re&s;olv'd to Sell

<HI>Broad-&s;ide</HI> and a lu&s;tly Volley of <HI>&s;mall Shott,</HI>
which &s;hot off our <HI>Taller,</HI> and wounded us three

Hor&s;es in the <HI>Hold,</HI> and having received two
Shots more between <HI>Wind and Water,</HI> we quick|ly
had about 4 or 5 foot Water in the <HI>Hold:</HI> we
An&s;wered them with our Guns, but to little
purpo&s;e; for having &s;oon &s;pent all the <HI>Powder</HI> we
had up out of our <HI>Powder-Room,</HI> and it being
Impo&s;&s;ible for us at that in&s;tant to come at any
more; and at the &s;ame time perceiving the o|ther
Ship almo&s;t with us, and that it was im|po&s;&s;ible
we &s;hould make good our Defence a|gain&s;t
2 of the <HI>best</HI> Ships of <HI>Algeirs</HI> (For they
proved to be the <HI>Golden Hor&s;e,</HI> old <HI>Canaria</HI>

<HI>Canaria</HI> Captain,) we thought be&s;t to Com|pound
for our <HI>Lives</HI> at the price of our <HI>Liberties,</HI>
and &s;urrendred our Ship.</P>
<P>Hereupon their Boat came aboard and fetcht
us all away, except two whom they left aboard
with &s;ome of their Turks and Moors. When
we came on Board the Turks man of Warr, the
Captain by an Interpreter inquired our Lading,
and with many menaces exacted a full Account
to the be&s;t of our knowledge, &s;oon after they
took 2 Ships more, and ere they went off our
Coa&s;t, they &s;urpriz'd in all 9 Ships, wherein
were about 170 Souls. And having taken the
men out, and pillag'd their plea&s;ure; &s;ome of
the Ships they <HI>Burnt,</HI> and others <HI>Sunk,</HI> having
<PB N="90" REF="67">
not Men enough to &s;pare to Man &s;o many, but
three of the be&s;t they &s;ent away home; And
having now been out of the <HI>Straights</HI> near &s;ix
Weeks, they are afraid to venture in without
<HI>clearing</HI> their Ships, and therefore went on the
South Coa&s;t of Barbary to <HI>Magadore,</HI> touching
al&s;o at <HI>Saphe</HI> and other Towns to take in fre&s;h
Provi&s;ions;</P>
<P>All this time we poor Captive Chri&s;tians were
put every night in <HI>Irons.</HI> The manner whereof
was thus, between 2 &s;pare <HI>Top-Ma&s;ts</HI> between
the Decks placed about 6 a&s;under, we &s;at clo&s;e
to one another on each &s;ide, and in the middle
went a long <HI>Iron Bolt</HI> between our Shackles, &s;o
that we were con&s;trained to &s;leep &s;itting (when
the nece&s;&s;itie of Nature could Charm our per|plexed
Spirits into any kind of Repo&s;e;) not
being afforded Room to <HI>lye down;</HI> And the
weather being extream <HI>hot,</HI> and the place

The Provi&s;ions alotted to keep us alive, (who
now began rather to Court and wi&s;h for <HI>Death)</HI>
was only a &s;mall pittance of Bread, and &s;ome
Vinegar, with a few drops of Oyl, and this was
all our Allowance for 24 Hours; and that
which yet added more to our mi&s;ery was, that
they afforded us not much above <HI>a pint</HI> of Wa|ter
a Day, &s;o that thro' very extremit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> of <HI>Thir&s;t,</HI>
we were frequently forc'd to beg and intreat
of the Moors boys, to bring us &s;alt Water, and
could but <HI>&s;eldome</HI> obtain that favour of them
<PB N="91" REF="67">
neither; Nay when we were in <HI>Magadore,</HI> tho
we could (like Tantalus for our greater Tor|ture)

&s;hore, and were almo&s;t Dead with Drought,
in working and continual heaving in of <HI>Balla&s;t,</HI>
yet we could not be allow'd but about 3 pints
for four and twenty Hours, and half of that
too, <HI>Salt</HI> or bracki&s;h; whereby we became &s;o
faint that we could hardly &s;tand on our Legs;
but it was vain to Intreat or expect any other
u&s;age from tho&s;e who&s;e tendere&s;t <HI>Mercies</HI> were
the Extremities of <HI>Cruelly,</HI> unle&s;s we would have
abandon'd all fear of God, and re&s;pect to <HI>mo|de&s;ty</HI>
and the Dignity of Humane Nature, by
Conde&s;cending to the dete&s;table &s;ollicitations of
their mo&s;t unnatural Lu&s;ts, to which they were
not wanting in their cur&s;ed Importunities; &s;o
that our very <HI>Souls</HI> were not free from their
Tortures; They being &s;o filthy as to mix with
<HI>Brute Bea&s;t,</HI> having &s;een &s;uch Evidences of their
abominations in that kind, with &s;ome Crea|tures

with horror, and are not fit to be named a|mong&s;t

in two or three days Arrived at their <HI>De&s;ired</HI>
Port;</P>
<P>Nor was it <HI>unde&s;ired</HI> by us: For as we long'd
to know the wor&s;t of our Condition, &s;o we flat|tered
our &s;elves that it mu&s;t needs be better than
that on Board, at lea&s;t that there we &s;hould have
<HI>Water</HI> enough, the Want of which here was in|tollerable.</P>
<P>Being brought a&s;hore we were &s;ent to the <HI>Ar|midore</HI>'s
Hou&s;e, and the next day carried to
the Pallace of the <HI>Dey,</HI> Ba&s;haw, or King, who
by his Prerogative out of every Eight Slaves
brought in, Chu&s;es <HI>one,</HI> and commonly elects
the Captains, as &s;uppo&s;ing they are able to pro|cure

<HI>Acceptable Pre&s;ents</HI> to the <HI>Grand Seignior;</HI> for
whom there is never any Redemption. The
next day about eight of us were carried into the
Market, and one or two of the Kings <HI>Slaves</HI>
with us, where about one a Clock we were led
about the Market, <HI>one by one</HI> by a <HI>Negro,</HI> who
<PB N="93" REF="68">

to this effect&mdash;<HI>Here is a brave Captain, a Mate,

there, will give more but to the value of a &s;hil|ling

<P>It was my hard fortune to be &s;old to a <HI>Taga|reen</HI>

his Name was <HI>Haly Hammet Ben Jejilee,</HI> and
for his Temper it was well known, for as I came
out with him from the Kings Hou&s;e, &s;everal told
me I had got <HI>a Cur&s;ed Patroon.</HI></P>
<P>But I was now in, <HI>for better for wor&s;e,</HI> and fol|lowed
him very ob&s;equiou&s;ly to his Hou&s;e, where
after a day or two, I with others of his Slaves
(whereof &s;everal were Engli&s;h) were &s;et to ga|ther
dung out of a <HI>Fondack,</HI> as they call it,
being the place where Hor&s;es, A&s;&s;es, Mules, and
Cows and other Cattel, &s;ometimes to the num|ber

they had occa&s;ion, who&s;e <HI>Blood</HI> mixt with their

<HI>Dung</HI> in that hot Climate, made it very noi&s;ome

but rake it up into Baskets, and carry it out
on our <HI>Heads</HI> or Shoulders, to a <HI>Dunghil</HI> at a
great di&s;tance.</P>
<P>This Jobb being fini&s;ht, we were put to work
in the <HI>Mould,</HI> abord Prizes, for &s;ometime, and
after that &s;ent to the <HI>Garden</HI> or <HI>Vineyard</HI> (for
it was both) about four miles from the Town,
where in&s;tead of digging with a <HI>Spade,</HI> we had
only a <HI>Chopp</HI> of 8. or <HI>10l.</HI> weight which we
were forced to work vvith at <HI>Arms-end,</HI> and I
think vvas as hard Labour as any could be,
unle&s;s grinding at their <HI>Silk-Mills;</HI> and if vve
<HI>Loitered,</HI> or they vvere plea&s;ed to think vve did
&s;o, pre&s;ently vve had many blovvs on the back,
and &s;ides, and &s;ometimes on the <HI>Soles</HI> of the
feet, and our hair torn off our heads, with other
inexpre&s;&s;ible Cruelties, whil&s;t in the mean time,
we had many times but one <HI>poor Cake</HI> of <HI>Cour&s;e
Bread</HI> allowed us <HI>per</HI> day for our diet, and our
Lodging at night mo&s;t hard and mi&s;erable, for
frequently when we were in the City, we were
driven into a <HI>Na&s;ty Cellar,</HI> where was an Hou&s;e
of Office that &s;tank intollerably; and the room
&s;o &s;mall, that there being near twenty of us,
it would not afford breadth or length enough
for us to <HI>Ly<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> Down,</HI> but there were &s;ome Bords

<P><PB N="95" REF="69">
Thus for many long moneths we continued
as mi&s;erable, as to this World, as 'twas po&s;&s;ible
for the Envy and Cruelty of our Patroon to
make us. You need not doubt but we had often
thoughts of making our <HI>E&s;cape,</HI> but the manner

our Boat, and to help us therein we were be|holding
to Mr. <HI>Showel,</HI> who &s;ince his Slavery,
upon I know not what former in&s;ight into that
My&s;tery, had &s;et up for a <HI>Cobler,</HI> and lived
from his <HI>Patroon</HI> under Contribution; and by
that means had the Opportunity to buy them,
which were privately convey'd into tho&s;e things
in which we carried Dung on the <HI>Mules,</HI> and
&s;o got out of the Tovvn, and &s;o &s;ovved up,
vvhich vvas mo&s;t artificially performed by Mr.
<HI>Showel</HI> and Mr. <HI>Bull,</HI> and the Boats covering
mo&s;t conveniently prepared, and all things
hid in parcells near the Sea-&s;ide ready for the
Voyage.</P>
<P>Hitherto things going on thus fairly, and
every one of our <HI>Cabal</HI> expecting no le&s;s than
Liberty, the very day appointed for our going
away at Evening being come, and having pro|vided
Bread and Water and other Nece&s;&s;aries
for that purpo&s;e. It happen'd our <HI>Patroon</HI> him|&s;elf,
who had not been in the Garden for &s;ome|time,
did, by I know not what ill-Fortune,
or rather as to me <HI>good Providence,</HI> come into
the Garden, of who&s;e approach a Spaniard &s;et
for <HI>a Spye,</HI> gave them notice, &s;o that they had
time enough <HI>to hide</HI> their things which they
were preparing that night to &s;et together, but
<PB N="98" REF="71">
&s;ome of them being found rambling, were &s;trict|ly
Examined, and when come home &s;everely
Beaten upon <HI>Su&s;pition,</HI> but they &s;tood it out
&s;tiffly, and never Impeached any.</P>
<P>In the mean time I was gone to call &s;ome more
of our Company, and at my return received
tidings from the <HI>Spaniard</HI> how Ca&s;es &s;tood&punc;
whereupon we con&s;ulted, whether it were be&s;t
to go on pre&s;ently, or deferr it for &s;ome time,
and it was carried for waiting another Oppor|tunity;
which whil&s;t we were expecting, ano|ther
Accident put us to &s;tand, which was thus,
Some of our Timbers being bound together, and
put into the next Garden by Con&s;ent of a Spa|niard,
vvho of Nece&s;&s;ity mu&s;t be made privy to
the De&s;ign, his <HI>Patroon</HI> happen'd to light up|on
them &s;o out to pieces, and violently be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">t
his Slave, but by good luck this old Fellovv and
our <HI>Patroon</HI> vvere not Friends, and &s;o the bu|&s;ine&s;s
never came to his Ear.</P>
<P>Therefore this Di&s;appointment of the lo&s;s
of our Timber did not vvholly di&s;courage, but
got others and framed them, and had brought
all things again to perfection, vvhen once more
our project vvas Interrupted, and by other
hands and in an untimely manner put in Exe|cution.</P>
<P>For about the latter end of <HI>November 1681</HI>
there came from other Gardens 2 Dutchmen&punc;
a Spaniard and &s;ome others; Who, by I can|not
gue&s;s, what means, being acquainted with
<PB N="99" REF="71">
our De&s;igns, and the forwardne&s;s we were in,
they Ingratiated them&s;elves with the Spaniards
that lay in our Garden, and agree with them
forthwith to make u&s;e of this Expedient for
their E&s;cape, And thereupon they threaten
<HI>John Atwood,</HI> who al&s;o lay there, that if He
would not Con&s;ent and go with them, they
would forthwith Kill him to prevent his ma|king
a Di&s;covery.</P>
<P>Poor Mr. <HI>Atwood</HI> was loth to abandon his
Friends, and Rob them of that means which
they &s;o long and with &s;uch Danger and Charge
had been Contriving to leave them behind, and
Embarque him&s;elf with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> as were for the
mo&s;t part Strangers; yet dread of Death and
Hopes of <HI>Liberty</HI> prevailed with him to Comply;
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> under pretence of &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span"> 
another <HI>Garden</HI> where was an Engli&s;hman privy
to the Intrigue and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span">  was and
that the <HI>Carpenter</HI> was at Work <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span">
re&s;olved to be going by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span"> Clock&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span">
poor Mans Patroon being in the Garden, he
could not come till Fight, and finding then

&s;everal <HI>Doggs</HI> a Barking <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;up|po&s;ed
they fearing &s;ome might be in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span"> of
them, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span"> a
Jarr of <HI>Water,</HI> &s;ome <HI>Figs,</HI> &s;ome <HI>Bread,</HI> and a

Engli&s;hman lamenting the lo&s;s of this
Opportunity, returned to his Garden undi&s;|covered.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="72">
Next morning 'twas my lot vvith one of my
Fellovv Slaves to be &s;ent into the Garden, but
finding no body there, and quickly perceiving
other Symptomes, I concluded they vvere gone&punc;
But Oh! hovv much <HI>anger</HI> did I &s;vvell vvith
again&s;t them for leaving me behind, (for as yet
I under&s;tood not the Truth, tho aftervvards I
did, from the before-mentioned Engli&s;h-man
that came too late,) and vvhat an Exce&s;s of
Grief and &s;orrovv did po&s;&s;e&s;s me for not going
vvith them; vvhen yet this very thing which
I &s;o much fretted my &s;elf about, was to me the
the mo&s;t <HI>eminent Mercy</HI> of Providence; for tho&s;e
that went off, were <HI>never any of them heard of,</HI>
&s;o that 'tis Ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;ed they were <HI>all lost</HI>
and ca&s;t away: And as for me that vvas left
behind, vvithin &s;ix vveeks after, my <HI>Ran&s;ome-Money</HI>
came from <HI>England,</HI> being 400 pieces of
Eight, be&s;ides 218 for Charges, and &s;o I &s;afely
returned to my Native Countrey; For vvhich
Gratious Providence of God, as I hope I &s;hall
never forget to return him continual thanks
from the Centre of my Soul, &s;o I thought it no
le&s;s than my Duty to give this Publique Te&s;ti|mony
of my Gratitude to that Divine and A|dorable
Power to whom be all prai&s;e, Glory,
and Honour both now and for Ever-more.</P>
