<OPENER><SALUTE>May it plea&s;e Your mo&s;t Excellent Maje&s;ty:</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Cannot, without &s;ome de&s;pondency of Mind, and awful fear of the Greatne&s;s of Your Maje&s;ty, make an Offering at Your Sacred Feet of &s;o &s;mall an E&s;teem and incon&s;iderable Value, as the&s;e following Hi&s;to|ries. For having travelled long in remote Countries, and re&s;ided no le&s;s than eighteen Years in <HI>Turky,</HI> the World may rea&s;onably expect &s;ome rich Returns unto Your Maje&s;ty in Per&s;ian Silks, and Tyrian Purples, or in the fine&s;t Carpets, and other Gayeties, in which the &s;oftne&s;s and luxury of the Le&s;&s;er <HI>A&s;ia</HI> did anciently abound: and may now judg me a Bankrupt, or ill Husband of my Talent, when they &s;ee me at Home trembling in Your Royal Pre&s;ence, with a Gift no more worthy than a few Sheets of Paper; which being a Sacrifice inferior and beneath the acceptance of &s;o Great a Monarch, I might rea&s;onably fear, that they would take fire at the heat of Your ju&s;t di&s;|plea&s;ure, were they not with all humility and reverence con&s;ecrated to the Royal Clemency. For in this glorious Title and Attribute, Your Maje&s;ty (as is notorious to the World) exceeding all the mo&s;t Serene and mo&s;t Clement Emperors that ever were, expects not from me, either Gold or Jewels, but rather a true Account of my Time, how I have &s;pent it in the Service of God, and of your Maje&s;ty: and how I have admini&s;tred that Publick Tru&s;t and In|tere&s;t which was committed to my Management. Accept therefore, <HI>GREAT SIR,</HI> the&s;e following Di&s;cour&s;es, to di&s;charge part of the Account of my Time, with other Treati&s;es which have been the Employment to fill up my vacant Intervals: the remaining account of my Hours are not to be ju&s;tified by my own Report, but by the Te&s;timony of others, who&s;e Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s will be as ready to own my Indu&s;try and Faithfulne&s;s in their Concernments, as they will be to excu&s;e and pardon my Infirmities.</P>
<P>Ever &s;ince the time of Your Maje&s;ty's happy Re&s;tauration, my Lot hath fal|len to live and act within the Dominions of the Turk, and there to move in a Publick Capacity; which though it was in an Admini&s;tration of one of the lowe&s;t Note and Degree, yet the great Influence which the flouri&s;hing E&s;tate of that Trade hath on the common Good of <HI>England,</HI> nouri&s;hed in me a &s;ecret Pride and Satisfaction in that Employment, which called and rai&s;ed up all my Endeavours to acquit my &s;elf therein with Prudence, Faithfulne&s;s, and In|du&s;try; there being the &s;ame Regularity required in the Stars of the lower, as in tho&s;e of higher Magnitude.</P>
<P>This hath been the fir&s;t, and indeed the only Affair I ever managed for the Publick: for before Your Maje&s;ty's ble&s;&s;ed Return, the Character noted on my Family of being Loyal, as it made them at fir&s;t active and zealous in the Service of Your Glorious Father, &s;o afterwards it famed them for their Suffer|ings, and rendred them and me uncapable of Office. But Your Maje&s;ty re|turning like the Sun, to animate and cheri&s;h all living Creatures, with an equa|lity proportioned to their &s;everal Capacities, hath been plea&s;ed al&s;o to be&s;tow a Ray of Your benign Influence on my &s;elf; whereby having received Com|fort and Refre&s;hment, I do with all &s;en&s;e of my Duty, and with entire Devo|tion, pray unto the King of Kings for the Happine&s;s, long Life, and immor|tal Glory of Your Maje&s;ty, and with all reverence and humble &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, devote and con&s;ecrate my &s;elf, for ever to remain,</P>

<HEAD>THE REIGN OF Sultan MORAT, OR AMURAT IV. The Eleventh EMPEROR; AND Twenty fir&s;t MONARCH OF THE TURKS.</HEAD>
<P>THE weak Under&s;tanding of Sultan <HI>Mu&s;tapha,</HI> and his inability for Rule, cau&s;ed the Affairs of State, both at Home and Abroad, to move di&s;order|ly and irregular. <HI>Where Violence and Inju&s;tice pre|vail, there is &s;o little di&s;tance between the mo&s;t emi|nent Height of Grandure, and the lowe&s;t Aby&s;s of Mi&s;ery, that a Prince may in a moment &s;tep from one unto the other.</HI> The Jani&s;aries and Military Officers commanded more now than the Civil, all things being guided by the Air and Fancy of the Souldiery, who placed and di&s;placed with that wind of Favour and Di&s;plea&s;ure, which is agreeable to the Humour of a Multitude, and the Licentiou&s;ne&s;s of Arms. For at the &s;ame time there were three Emperors, &s;even Great Viziers, two Captain-Pa&s;ha's, five Aga's of the Jani&s;aries, three Trea&s;urers, &s;ix Pa&s;ha's of <HI>Cai|ro;</HI> and in proportion, the Changes and Altera|tions were as many in all the Provinces of the Empire. All this Confu&s;ion evidently proceed|ing from the weak and almo&s;t &s;en&s;le&s;s Under|&s;tanding of <HI>Mu&s;tapha;</HI> the Mini&s;ters and People concurred, as it were, in an univer&s;al Con&s;ent to dethrone him a &s;econd time, and exalt into his Place Sultan <HI>Morat</HI> Brother to <HI>O&s;man,</HI> who was murdered the Year before. The Principal Actors in this Contrivance, were <HI>Kio&s;em</HI> the Mother of <HI>Morat,</HI> and the Mufti. But in the execution hereof, three Difficulties occurred: The fir&s;t was <HI>Chu&s;aein</HI> Pa&s;ha the Great Vizier; who by rea&s;on of the Inabilities of <HI>Mu&s;tapha,</HI> being become ab&s;olute Lord and Soveraign of all, would be unwilling to a&s;&s;ent unto that Propo&s;i|tion, which might degrade him of his Dignity, and dive&s;t him of his Power. A &s;econd Ob&s;ta|&s;tacle was the Fancy and Humour of the Soul|diery, who having with much Zeal and Pa&s;&s;ion exalted <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> to the Throne, it might be doubted, that in maintenance of the &s;ame Hu|mour, they would with equal ob&s;tinacy per&s;e|vere in their Election. A third was the Poverty or low Ebb of the Exchequer, which at that time was in no capacity to &s;upply that Dona|tive to the Souldiery, which was u&s;ual and cu|&s;tomary at the Inauguration of every Sultan. To forward and ha&s;ten this Change, and ripen this Plot, the News of the Rebellion of <HI>Aba&s;&s;a</HI> did much contribute; who with a Body of fif|teen thou&s;and Hor&s;e, roved over all the Plains of <HI>Kara-hi&s;ar,</HI> calling him&s;elf Avenger of Sul|tan <HI>O&s;man</HI>'s Murder, and Enemy of the Jani|&s;aries; by who&s;e Mutiny and Con&s;piracy he was put to Death: in &s;atisfaction for which, he not only killed all Jani&s;aries which fell into his hands; but their Wives, Children, and tho&s;e allied to them, he de&s;troyed with implacable Malice and bloody Rage. Upon this Advice, the Jani&s;aries at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> being moved with equal Fury and de&s;ire of Revenge, applied them&s;elves to their Aga, propo&s;ing a &s;peedy Union with the Spahees, for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing this Rebellion before Time gave it greater growth, and made the Hu|mour more &s;tubborn and difficult to be purged. At the &s;ame time al&s;o came Letters from <HI>Cicala</HI> Pa&s;ha, (who was di&s;patched into <HI>A&s;ia</HI> with a &s;trong Party, to give a &s;top to the farther Pro|gre&s;s and Advance of <HI>Aba&s;&s;a</HI>) advi&s;ing that up|on his near approach to the Enemy, &s;o general a Fear po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his Souldiery, that mo&s;t of them
<PB N="2" REF="4">disbanded and for&s;ook their Colours; and that at pre&s;ent he had no more than five hundred Ja|ni&s;aries, and two hundred Spahees under his Command, which he found to be an unequal Match to contend with the increa&s;ing Power of <HI>Aba&s;&s;a.</HI> This Intelligence &s;erved happily the occa&s;ion of the Mufti, Vizier, and Aga, to give a turn to the de&s;ired Change, and &s;upplied them with an An&s;wer to the Jani&s;aries, that they were ready to yield compliance unto their Addre&s;s, but that the Incapacity of their Soveraign ob|&s;tructed their Proceedings, and that the Defect in the Principal Wheel di&s;ordered all the Mo|tions of good Government. At which Reply the Jani&s;aries becoming more unquiet, a&s;&s;embled them&s;elves in a tumultuous manner at the Mo&s;ch of Sultan <HI>Solyman;</HI> where making an<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ayack</HI> in Turki&s;h &s;ignifies a Foot.</NOTE> Ayack Divan, (&s;o called, becau&s;e they &s;it not down, but &s;tand on their Legs, to denote the pre&s;ent ha&s;te and urgency of their Affair) it was en|acted, by an unanimous con&s;ent of the Civil and Military Power, That young <HI>Morat,</HI> or <HI>Amurat,</HI> &s;hould be promoted to the Throne, and that <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> &s;hould be depo&s;ed: And becau&s;e the Exchequer was at its lowe&s;t Ebb, and wholly exhau&s;ted by mi&s;carriage of the Officers, the Souldiers were contented to di&s;pen&s;e with their Donative; which they relinqui&s;hed in con&s;ide|ration of the Publick Good, re&s;erving &s;till their Title and Claim thereunto at times of a more happy Inauguration. With this News the Vi|zier immediately mounted on Hor&s;e-back to &s;ig|nify this Univer&s;al Decree to <HI>Mu&s;tapha;</HI> but he found him &s;o &s;tupid, as if he had been in&s;en&s;ible of the Me&s;&s;age; and his Mother wanting Power to re&s;i&s;t this &s;trong Convul&s;ion, gave way to Ne|ce&s;&s;ity, and &s;eemed to embrace what &s;he could not oppo&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> falling from the Heaven of his Throne to the Aby&s;s of his Pri&s;on, &s;eemed to return unto his Centre; for being only by the Wild-fire of Fortune carried as far aloft, as the force of popular Powder could reach, he after|wards by the meer weight of his earthly Temper returned with the like quickne&s;s of Motion to the place from whence he a&s;cended.</P>
<P>Hereupon Sultan <HI>Amurat,</HI> a Youth of about fourteen years of Age, was brought forth to the People, and placed in the Throne with all the Acclamations and Rejoycings of the People. And being taught by his Mother in a feigned man|ner to refu&s;e acceptance of the Empire, he pre|tended that the Exchequer was exhau&s;ted, and that therefore he was not able to demon&s;trate the Affection and E&s;teem he had for them; and that &s;ince they had killed their former Sultans, he was fearful le&s;t the tenderne&s;s of his Age &s;hould be|tray him to the like Violence: but the Souldiery having not the patience to hearken to his Excu&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Amurat</HI> in&s;talled.</NOTE> immediately carried him to the Divan, where ha|ving cloathed him in White, they &s;eated him on a Safraw, erected with four Pillars, &s;tudded with precious Stones; the Covering of which was of Crim&s;on-Velvet, richly embroidered with Gold and Oriental-Pearl. And being &s;o &s;eated, the Mufti with all reverence approached, and ki&s;&s;ed his Hand; and then turning to the People, he de|manded of them, If they were contented with that Prince whom they now beheld in the Seat of the Ottoman Kings? To which they having gi|ven a&s;&s;ent by their loud Acclamations; <HI>Morat,</HI> with a becoming gravity, encharged the Mufti to take care that Ju&s;tice and the Law be executed, and &s;o retired to his Lodgings with general &s;ati&s;|faction. The next morning he was carried by Water to the Mo&s;ch of <HI>Jub</HI> in the Suburbs of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> where according to the Solemnity of the Ottoman Empire, having performed his<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Which is a di&s;pen&s;ing of Mutton to the Poor.</NOTE> <HI>Corban,</HI> or Sacrifice, and having his Cemiter grit to his Side by the Emir&s;heriff, he mounted on Hor&s;e-back, and with a magnificent Train en|tred by the Gate of <HI>Adrianople.</HI> In the mean time <HI>Mu&s;tapha,</HI> who was more worthy to bear a Fool's Cap than an Imperial Diadem, was con|ducted to Pri&s;on, and more narrowly guarded than formerly; how&s;oever no Man offered to take away his Life, the Per&s;ons of Fools and Idiots being &s;acred in e&s;teem of the Turks, and the lea&s;t Injury offered to them accounted Irreligious and Unlucky.</P>
<P><HI>Morat</HI> was of a lively Countenance, full-fac'd, dark Hair, of a black and lively Eye, ruddy and &s;anguine Complexion, and in every degree of a promi&s;ing and hopeful A&s;pect: but his exteriour appearance did not corre&s;pond with the internal Cruelty of his violent Spirit, having &s;ome &s;imili|tude with the Swan, which hath white Feathers and black Fle&s;h.</P>
<P>The Great Vizier who a&s;&s;i&s;ted at this Solemnity, was (as we have &s;aid) <HI>Chu&s;aein</HI> Pa&s;ha, a Per&s;on of Self-intere&s;t, who had wa&s;ted and con&s;umed the Trea&s;ury, and converted a great part there|of to his own Benefit; he was a Tyrant, hated of all Men, and &s;upported him&s;elf by no other Art than bribing of the Souldiery: And to his other Crimes he added, that of having unju&s;tly per&s;ecuted <HI>Halil</HI> Pa&s;ha, and deprived him of his Office, his Power not reaching to the taking a|way his Life; which being re&s;erved for better Times, he was again recalled from his Retire|ment, and by &s;pecial Command of the Sultan, was unwillingly re&s;tored to the Office of Vizier, being be&s;t plea&s;ed with a quiet and pacifick Life, to which his melancholy Temper had naturally di&s;po&s;ed him. In the mean time <HI>Chu&s;aein</HI> Pa&s;ha being terrified by the &s;en&s;ible touches of his own Con&s;cience, took his flight by way of the Black Sea; and being out of the reach of Ju&s;tice, a Fine was &s;et of Five thou&s;and Zechins, and of Lands to the Revenue of an hundred thou&s;and A&s;pers a Year, to be given unto him who &s;hould bring his Head. Many of tho&s;e who had &s;old him their Friend&s;hip and Favour, being affrigh|ted with this Sentence, voluntarily di&s;gorged the Rewards they had received; and among&s;t the re&s;t, the la&s;t Aga of the Jani&s;aries, who had been his Kahya or Steward for the &s;pace of three months, re&s;tored 8 hundred thou&s;and Dollars as an Atonement for his Sin, and a Ran&s;om for pur|cha&s;ing his own Life and Office. At length, by force of the foregoing Reward, <HI>Chu&s;aein</HI> Pa&s;ha was betrayed and taken alive; and being brought to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> was immediately &s;trangled be|fore the Gate of the Divan.</P>
<P>Many were the Difficulties which this young Sultan was to encounter; the greate&s;t of which was the In&s;olence of the Jani&s;aries, who feeling them&s;elves empty of Mony, began to repent of the prodigal and ea&s;y remi&s;&s;ion of their Dona|tive, and in a tumultuous manner to redemand it again. There was no Argument or Debate to be u&s;ed again&s;t Men of the Sword, who hearkned to no other Rea&s;on than their own Wants, and to &s;atisfy them, there was no other Remedy than Compliance; wherefore all Officers and Per&s;ons not employed in Military Affairs were forced to contribute towards a large Tax, and a &s;hame|ful Demand was made for the Loan of Thirty thou&s;and Zechins from the four Chri&s;tian Am|ba&s;&s;adors re&s;ident at the Port, that they al&s;o as Friends might yield an a&s;&s;i&s;ting hand towards the pre&s;ent Urgency of Affairs: &s;o little con&s;i|deration
<PB N="3" REF="4">and &s;hame have Turks to lay open the Nakedne&s;s and di&s;tre&s;s of their Country even to Strangers and Enemies of it. And indeed &s;uch was the In&s;olence and uncontroulable Power of the Souldiery, that their De&s;ires and Commands were Laws, and their Determinations Rules for their Sultan and his Subjects.</P>
<P>This Humour of U&s;urpation and unlimited Power, wearied all the Officers of the Empire, and inclined them &s;ecretly to approve the Cau&s;e of <HI>Aba&s;&s;a</HI> Pa&s;ha of <HI>Erzirum,</HI> who declared and &s;tiled him&s;elf Enemy to the Jani&s;aries; and of <HI>Bechir</HI> Pa&s;ha of <HI>Babylon,</HI> who was joined with him. The Vizier al&s;o finding his Power abrid|ged by the Arbitrary Will of the Souldiery, mo|ved &s;lowly and coldly into <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> where all the Force he could make, con&s;i&s;ted of no more than fifty thou&s;and new and unexperienced Men, &s;uch as were uncapable to contend with a more nume|rous Army of veterane Souldiers; to which al|&s;o the Beglerbei of <HI>Anatolia</HI> joined him&s;elf, as did all other the chief Timar-Spahees, who con|&s;pired together to confound and de&s;troy the Pride and Government of the Jani&s;aries. The Vizier al&s;o was of the &s;ame Party, and coldly at fir&s;t an&s;wered the Reque&s;t of the Jani&s;aries, when they earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed him to lead them a|gain&s;t <HI>Aba&s;&s;a</HI> their common and mortal Enemy: At length, being fortified with the Force of the Timar-Spahees, he told them plainly, That if they would go and fight, he would be a Specta|tor of the Succe&s;s, but would not engage him|&s;elf in a Quarrel wherein the Blood of <HI>Mu&s;&s;el|men</HI> might be &s;pilt on one &s;ide and the other: by which means the Rebels in <HI>A&s;ia</HI> took Head, in|crea&s;ed in Force, and every day rendred them in a more formidable and dangerous po&s;ture.</P>
<P>But this was not all the Trouble which en&s;u|ed; for the Tartars having refu&s;ed that King whom the Grand Signior had appointed them to receive, declared for <HI>Mehmet</HI> his Brother: who was &s;econded by the Votes of the Generality, and maintained by the &s;tronge&s;t Nerve of that Nation. The Vizier was unwilling to ingage in this Quarrel, alledging, That a Civil War was the wor&s;t of Evils, and that it was better to connive at a pre&s;ent Inconvenience, than in this di&s;tracted Time of Affairs, to pollute the Empire with the Blood of Tartars, who were their Brethren, and of the &s;ame Religion and Alliance with them. How&s;oever the Divan was of ano|ther Opinion, and re&s;olved to di&s;peed the Cap|tain-Pa&s;ha with a Force &s;ufficient to re-in&s;tate <HI>Gherey</HI> (for &s;o the Elder Brother was called) in the Government of that Kingdom. But yet the In&s;tructions given, rather directed him to act with Dexterity than with Force, &s;uppo&s;ing that the Authority of the Turks abetted with the pre&s;ence of a con&s;iderable Force, would create an inclination in the Tartars to Obedience, &s;o &s;oon as they di&s;covered them to appear on their Coa&s;t. The Captain-Pa&s;ha being arrived at<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The chief City of the <HI>Krim</HI> Tar|tar.</NOTE> <HI>Caff&aacute;,</HI> declared, That he was &s;ent by the Grand Signior, not to exclude either one or other of the Pretenders, but only to be Witne&s;s of a free and fair Election; that &s;o all Civil Di&s;cord cea&s;ing, that Party might be cho&s;en who was mo&s;t plea&s;ing to the generality of the Peo|ple. To which end two Standards were erect|ed, one for<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg"><HI>Gherey</HI> the Name of the Family.</NOTE> <HI>Gherey</HI> the Elder Brother de&s;ired by the Turks, and the other for <HI>Mehmet</HI> beloved of the Tartars. The People in multitudes ran to the Standard of <HI>Mehmet,</HI> and but few to that of <HI>Gherey;</HI> which demon&s;trated at how mean a rate the Tartars e&s;teemed the Protection and Fa|vour of the Port. The Captain-Pa&s;ha vexed hereat, denied to give his A&s;&s;ent to the Confirma|tion, on pretence, that he was fir&s;t to demand the Grand Signior's Plea&s;ure; but at length was per&s;waded by <HI>Gherey</HI> to land a Force of about eight thou&s;and Men to own and maintain his Cau&s;e, on hopes, that rather than ingage again&s;t the Turks, the People would conde&s;cend to Terms in his Admi&s;&s;ion and Favour. The Tar|tars not being in the lea&s;t di&s;mayed hereat, ar|rayed them&s;elves in a warlike Po&s;ture, and feign|ing Fear and Flight, allured the Turks to a pur|&s;uit of them, until they had brought them to a place where thirty thou&s;and Hor&s;e lay in ambu&s;h; which on a &s;udden ari&s;ing and encompa&s;&s;ing them round, had entirely de&s;troyed them, had not <HI>Salil</HI> the Brother of <HI>Mehmet</HI> given a &s;top to the &s;laughter, on hopes, that &s;uch a te&s;timony of Friend&s;hip would reconcile the Spirits of the Turks, at lea&s;t might render his Brother's pre|ferment more tolerable and grateful to the Turks. In this conflict, <HI>Ibrahim</HI> and <HI>Chu&s;aein</HI> who were Viziers of the Bench, the kahya and a Capigi|ba&s;he of the Seraglio were &s;lain, who&s;e Bodies were afterwards tran&s;ported to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> &s;ix hundred Jani&s;aries and as many Sea-men were kil|led, and fifteen hundred Pri&s;oners were taken, who&s;e Liberty was procured at a mean Ran&s;om, for the &s;ake of that Faith and Religion which they jointly profe&s;&s;ed; they al&s;o took thirty Pieces of Cannon, and might al&s;o have become Ma&s;ters of the whole Fleet con&s;i&s;ting of thirty &s;ix Gallies, had they been de&s;irous to have pro&s;e|cuted their Victory to the utmo&s;t advantage: and moreover in that conjuncture of Affairs, when a general con&s;ternation had over&s;pread the principal parts of the Ottoman Dominions, when the Councils were feeble and faint, and that a langui&s;hing Pul&s;e beat in all the Government, had the Tartar with an Army of fifty thou&s;and Hor&s;e then ready to march, made up to the Walls of <HI>Adrianople,</HI> it might have proved &s;uch an opportunity for dividing and de&s;troying this Empire, as hath not offered at any time &s;ince that Occa&s;ion. But the two Brothers, <HI>Mehmet</HI> and <HI>Salil,</HI> &s;tiling their War forced and defen&s;ive, u&s;ed that moderation in their Victory, which might not provoke a de&s;ire of Revenge in the Turks. The Captain-Pa&s;ha being thus permit|ted to depart from <HI>Caffa</HI> with his Fleet, &s;ailed to <HI>Varna,</HI> a Port in the Black Sea, about two hundred miles di&s;tant from <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> where the News of this Defeat being arrived, put all the City into confu&s;ion, and rai&s;ed the Viziers at midnight to con&s;ult of tho&s;e Remedies and Ex|pedients which were agreeable to the pre&s;ent e|mergency of Affairs. The Great Vizier <HI>Ali</HI> was of opinion, that the Grand Signor ought to conde&s;cend to Terms of Accommodation, tho to the di&s;advantage and di&s;reputation of his Power; and that accordingly a Letter &s;hould be wrote to <HI>Mehmet</HI> the Tartar, beginning with the u&s;ual Complements of Friend&s;hip and Saluta|tion; and afterwards declaring, That it was ne|ver the intention of the Port to ingage in a War again&s;t him, the late conflict having only pro|ceeded from a mi&s;take and mi&s;interpretation of Orders; and that there was no other de&s;ign, than to compo&s;e the Civil Differences among&s;t them&s;elves, by advancing that Prince to the Kingly Dignity who was mo&s;t plea&s;ing and grateful to the People. This Advice was appro|ved by the re&s;t of the Council, and a Me&s;&s;enger di&s;patched with the Letter, accompanied with a Cemiter and Ve&s;t of Sables, which are the Sig|nals of the Sultan's Favour. In the mean time the People murmured at the pu&s;illanimity of the
<PB N="4" REF="5">Government, &s;aying, That they had &s;ent an Amba&s;&s;ador to thank the Tartar for not &s;eizing their whole Fleet, and acknowledg their Obliga|tion to him for the Blows and Wounds he had gi|ven their Army. The Tartars al&s;o gloried in this &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and took the boldne&s;s to vaunt of their Linage and De&s;cent to be more Ancient and Noble than that of the Ottoman Family; and that in this time of decay and degenerate proce|dure of that Monarchy, it appertained to the Greatne&s;s of the Tartars to &s;tir up the Fire and &s;nuff the Lamp, that the Splendor of that Em|pire might become more bright and &s;hining than in former Ages. And &s;o little re&s;pect did they now maintain for the Port, that they &s;urpri&s;ed two Amba&s;&s;adors &s;ent from the Mo&s;covite in their way to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> robbed and killed them, as al&s;o the Turki&s;h Chiaus that was with them, le&s;t his Te&s;timony &s;hould be brought in for an evi|dence again&s;t them.</P>
<P>During the&s;e Troubles, the Co&s;&s;acks taking advantage of the Captain-Pa&s;ha's ab&s;ence in <HI>Tartary,</HI> entered the <HI>Bo&s;phorus</HI> with about an hun|and fitty Sail of Saicks and Boats;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The form of the Co&s;&s;acks Boats.</NOTE> the&s;e Boats and Ve&s;&s;els which the Co&s;&s;acks u&s;e, are built long and light, with ten Oars of a &s;ide, and two Men to an Oar; the Head and Stern are not unlike, &s;o that they hang the Rudder &s;ometimes at one end, and &s;ometimes at the other, being not ob|liged to turn their Ve&s;&s;el, but without lo&s;s of time to proceed with that end which happens to be foremo&s;t. Each Boat carries fifty &s;elect Men armed with Fire-arms and Cemiter, in the ma|nagement of which they are very expert; and are a People &s;ober, enduring Labour and hard Diet; and &s;o &s;peedy in their Incur&s;ions, that they fore&s;tal the Advices, and commonly &s;trike be|fore they threaten. With the&s;e Boats and Peo|ple (as we have &s;aid) they entred the <HI>Bo&s;phorus,</HI> where they burnt &s;everal Villages and Hou&s;es of Plea&s;ure; on the Grecian &s;ide they burnt <HI>Boyuc|deri</HI> and <HI>Yenichioi,</HI> on the A&s;ian &s;ide <HI>Stenia.</HI> The appearance of this Enemy &s;o near the Imperial City, cau&s;ed a general Con&s;ternation, not un|like that at <HI>London,</HI> when the Dutch entred the River of <HI>Chatham.</HI> To oppo&s;e this Force, there was not one Gally in readine&s;s, &s;o that Saicks, Chimbers, and &s;mall Boats were armed, to the number of four or five hundred, and man'd with &s;uch people as the pre&s;ent ha&s;te and expediti|on offered; the great Chain was then brought forth to cro&s;s the <HI>BO&s;phorus,</HI> which the Grecian Emperors u&s;ed at the Seige of <HI>Con&s;tantinople:</HI> and Ten thou&s;and Men were i&s;&s;ued from the City to defend the Shoar from depredation and far|ther mi&s;chief. The Turki&s;h Fleet faced the Co&s;|&s;acks to give them a &s;top, whil&s;t they hovered about the middle of the Chanel in form of a Half-Moon, and &s;o continued the whole day until Sun-&s;et; when with the night they returned into the Sea, carrying with them, be&s;ides their Booty, Glory &s;ufficient to have entred the Chanel, and without blows or oppo&s;ition, to have braved the Capital Seat of the Ottoman Monarchy, and the mo&s;t formidable City of the whole Word. Not many days after they returned again with a grea|ter Force than before, which put the City into the like con&s;ternation; and having hovered a|bout three or four days at the Mouth of the Black Sea, they burnt the Pharos or Lantern with certain Villages thereabouts, and being laden with Spoils and Glory, they again returned into their own Country. Thus we may ob&s;erve, how bold Enemies are made with the weakne&s;s of a State: a Hor&s;e is &s;oon &s;en&s;ible of his Rider, when backed by a faint Hand, and an unaccu&s;tomed Lightne&s;s, but a &s;tiff Rein and a clo&s;e Knee makes him obedient to his Ruler. All people having di&s;covered the imbecillity of the Government, made head again&s;t it: and the young Sultan had tho&s;e for his Enemies in the time of his Nonage, which in his &s;trong and fiercer years became the mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and Fawning Slaves in the World.</P>
<P>And though at this time the Turki&s;h Mini&s;ters were corrupt and rebellious, and the Souldiery mutinous; yet <HI>Bethlem Gabor</HI> Prince of <HI>Tran&s;ylva|nia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bethlem Gabor</HI> de|&s;ires a&s;&s;i|&s;tance again&s;t the Emperor.</NOTE> a Chri&s;tian, was ob&s;ervant to the Port, de|manding Licence to wage War again&s;t the Em|peror, which was ea&s;ily granted, and upon pai+ment of the u&s;ual Tribute of Ten thou&s;and Hungars, the Amba&s;&s;ador, with thirteen of his Followers, received Coftans or Ve&s;ts of Honour, and a promi&s;e of Succour and Protection, as the Condition of his Affairs &s;hould require. Thus we &s;ee, that whil&s;t the Turks them&s;elves endea|voured to rent in pieces their own Monarchy, to which one would have thought, that the Chri|&s;tians had mo&s;t rea&s;on to contribute; yet &s;uch was the unhappy Fate of Chri&s;tendom, that <HI>Ga|bor</HI> was the only Per&s;on at that time to court the Turks; and that for no other Rea&s;on, than that he might be &s;upported and abetted in a War a|gain&s;t the Emperor and other Chri&s;tian Princes of <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>The Army of <HI>Bethlem Gabor</HI> con&s;i&s;ted of above Thirty thou&s;and Men, with which he marched over all <HI>Hungary,</HI> having taken mo&s;t Towns of con&s;ideration, unle&s;s <HI>Presburg,</HI> alias <HI>Po&s;&s;onium, Rab,</HI> and <HI>Komorra.</HI> But if we penetrate into the depth and foundation of this War, we &s;hall find that it had a deeper Intere&s;t than that of <HI>Gabor,</HI> and had its Original from the Di&s;cord and Civil War of <HI>Germany.</HI> For the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> be|ing at that time in a condition to render it &s;elf formidable, and in a po&s;ture to create a jealou&s;y in all the Princes &s;ubjected to it, did under co|lour of &s;ubduing the Palatine of the <HI>Rhyne,</HI> op|pre&s;s al&s;o the Liberty of the Empire, and of the &s;everal States which compo&s;ed it. For after the Emperor, again&s;t the Con&s;titutions of the Gol|den Seal, and the Sen&s;e of the Electoral Colledg, had dive&s;ted the Palatine and his Children of their E&s;tates and Dignity, not &s;o much by Force of Arms, as by Deceit and Breach of Promi&s;e; in&s;tead of disbanding the Army, which was to have been performed according to Agreement, new Troops were added; and though the Pro|te&s;tant League was di&s;&s;olved, yet the Catholick Combination, with all its Adherents, remained armed and immoveable to compel the Prote&s;tants to a re&s;titution of the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Revenue, notwith&s;tanding the Articles of Peace to the con|trary: &s;o that the Princes and Towns of the Lower <HI>Saxony</HI> entring into a new League, rai&s;ed an Army under the Command of <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> of <HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Alber&s;tadt. Bethlem Gabor</HI> having his Intere&s;t adjoyned to this Party, enter|tained the &s;ame De&s;ires and Intentions, to &s;up|pre&s;s the Greatne&s;s of the Emperor; and ha|ving the ju&s;t complaint to alledge of wanting his annual Pen&s;ion of Fifty thou&s;and Crowns, as was agreed by the Treaty of <HI>Niclasbourg,</HI> he re|&s;olved to force it by Arms, and take part with the Princes of the Prote&s;tant Religion which he profe&s;&s;ed: but becau&s;e his Srength and Power was not &s;ufficient, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Turks, he not only obtained their permi&s;&s;ion and approbation of this War, as we have &s;aid be|fore, but by paiment of Fifty thou&s;and Dollars pre&s;ented to the fir&s;t Vizier, and of Forty thou|&s;and by way of annual Tribute, he procured an

<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That on both parts Arms be laid down for ten months, and all Acts of Ho&s;tility cea&s;e; that on neither &s;ide any attempt &s;hould be made ei|ther by force or fraud to take any Ca&s;tles, Forts, Cities, or places of Defence during this time; and that both Germans, Hungarians, and Turks &s;hould be alike comprehended.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That if the Emperor were de&s;irous to treat and conclude a final Peace with the Grand Signi|or, he &s;hould u&s;e <HI>Bethlem Gabor</HI> as Mediator, and do nothing therein without his privity.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That all Places and Forts taken by the Prince of <HI>Tran&s;ylvania</HI> in his late Expedition, and that all Cities and Ca&s;tles now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of either, &s;hould &s;o remain without any alteration.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. That all Pa&s;&s;ages &s;hould be open for free Trade of Merchants, and all other the Subjects and Friends of either &s;ide.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>A Truce being thus concluded, the Turks in their return made great havock, carrying with them great numbers of poor Chri&s;tians into Sla|very, which <HI>Gabor</HI> out of compa&s;&s;ion &s;eemed wil|ling to redeem with a low price at his own charge; which the Turks refu&s;ing, carried tho&s;e mi&s;erable Wretches into Captivity. The Count <HI>E&s;terha&s;i</HI> Governour of <HI>Newhau&s;el</HI> for the Empe|ror, being highly incen&s;ed at this treacherous Action, contrary to the Truce &s;o lately conclu|ded, having drawn out a &s;ufficient Force from the neighbouring Gari&s;ons, fell on the Rear of the Turks in their March towards <HI>Buda,</HI> and charged them &s;o home on the Banks of the River <HI>Niter,</HI> that he killed five hundred of them on the place, took all their Baggage, with divers Pri&s;oners, and gave liberty to many Chri&s;tian Slaves. The next day but one after he charged another Party of them, as they attempted to pa&s;s a Bridg, which the night before he had cau&s;ed to be bro|ken down; of which having killed a great num|ber, the re&s;t &s;aved them&s;elves by &s;wimming: how&s;oever many Chri&s;tians procured their liberty thereby, and a con&s;iderable Booty was made of Hor&s;es, Camels, Waggons, and all Provi&s;ions. The other Troops con&s;i&s;ting of greater numbers, were wor&s;e treated than the former; for <HI>E&s;ter|ha&s;i</HI> having received a Recruit of Hor&s;e from <HI>Reiffemberg</HI> Governor of <HI>Komorra,</HI> and <HI>Breuner</HI> of <HI>Jarvarin</HI> or <HI>Rab,</HI> he proceeded boldly to meet the Turks, and joyning Battel with them, he &s;lew twelve hundred on the place, gave liberty to fourteen hundred Chri&s;tians, took divers of their principal Commanders, with all their Bag and Baggage, be&s;ides a con&s;iderable quantity of Gold and Silver, in Plate and Mony. Nor were <HI>Reif|femberg</HI> and <HI>Breuner</HI> le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful over tho&s;e who pa&s;&s;ed through their Quarters to joyn with the Gari&s;ons of <HI>Alba Regalis</HI> and <HI>Cani&s;ia,</HI> having killed &s;even hundred of them, and taken all their Baggage. Moreover Count <HI>Serini</HI> in his Jouney towards <HI>Vienna,</HI> defeated &s;ix hundred of them, and pre&s;ented their Colours to the Empe|rour: and <HI>E&s;terha&s;i</HI> in like manner after his &s;e|veral Exploits, offered thirty Cornets at his Feet, with &s;ix Pri&s;oners of Quality, one o f which was Kin&s; man of <HI>Bethlem Gabor.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Rebuffs cooled the courage of the Turks a little, and altered the re&s;olution of the Council for carrying forward the War on the &s;ide of <HI>Ger|many,</HI> as was intended, had the Succe&s;s an&s;wered expectation: For the&s;e Misfortunes abroad, and inte&s;tine Troubles at home, with Pe&s;tilence and Famine, which at the &s;ame time greatly afflicted the parts of <HI>Con&s;tatinople</HI> (whereby an hundred thou&s;and People died) abated the Mettle of the Turks, and cau&s;ed them to take new Mea&s;ures in all their Determinations: and for that rea&s;on Amba&s;&s;adors were &s;ent both to <HI>Vienna</HI> and into <HI>Poland</HI> to renew the Articles of Peace, and &s;o to confirm the League, that whil&s;t the Sultan was imployed in his Wars with <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and the Ea&s;tern Countries, nothing &s;hould intervene from the We&s;tern Parts to trouble or ob&s;truct his Pro|gre&s;s, or recal him from his Enterpri&s;e. For now the Rebellion of <HI>Aba&s;&s;a,</HI> joined with <HI>Bechir</HI> Pa&s;ha of <HI>Bagdat,</HI> growing daily more con&s;idera|ble, and his &s;trength increa&s;ing to that conditi|on, that he was able to keep the Field in de|&s;pight of the Grand Signiors Forces, he adven|tured to quarter within five days March of <HI>Con|&s;tantinople:</HI> and at the &s;ame time Letters coming from <HI>Hafi&s;h</HI> Pa&s;ha General of the Army in the Province of <HI>Bagdat,</HI> that the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> was entred into the Dominions of the Turk with a powerful Army, a general Con&s;ternation &s;eized the whole Turki&s;h Court, the wi&s;e&s;t and &s;toute&s;t having occa&s;ion to call up for all their Wi&s;dom and Courage to a&s;&s;i&s;t at a Time when the Go|vernment was a&s;&s;ailed on all &s;ides, both at home and abroad. Various were the Coun&s;els and Propo&s;als in what manner to proceed in Times of &s;uch emergency. Fir&s;t it was re&s;olved to pro|claim a War both again&s;t the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and the Rebels in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and that who&s;oever took of the Grand Signior Pay, from one A&s;per a day to higher value, &s;hould be in readine&s;s to &s;erve in the War, upon penalty of lo&s;ing his E&s;tate, of being accounted a Rebel, and his Wife and Chil|dren &s;old for Slaves. But the more &s;ober and moderate &s;ort judged it policy to take off <HI>A|ba&s;&s;a,</HI> by &s;ending him a general Pardon, with a conce&s;&s;ion of all his Demands, upon condition, that he &s;hould turn his Arms upon the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> who was the common Enemy of their Country and Religion: but the Jani&s;aries would by no means a&s;&s;ent to this Agreement, with a Per&s;on to whom they bore a more inveterate ha|tred, than to the Per&s;ian him&s;elf, as he did al&s;o to the Jani&s;aries. For that he might better ju&s;ti|fie his pretence of Revenge, he declared, That being one day in a Mo&s;ch at his Prayers, the murdered <HI>O&s;man</HI> appeared to him, and taking him by the hand, &s;aid, My faithful <HI>Mu&s;&s;ulman,</HI> &s;ince thou art the mo&s;t generous of all my Slaves, I command thee to revenge my Death, with the Blood of &s;ixty thou&s;and Jani&s;aries and Spahees; good Forture &s;hall accompany thy Arms, and Victory &s;hall crown thy Labours. During the&s;e Intrigues and Difficulties of Reconciliation, <HI>A|ba&s;&s;a,</HI> &s;poiled the Le&s;&s;er <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and the Per&s;ian King conquered the City and Province of <HI>Bagdan,</HI> or <HI>Babylon,</HI> took <HI>Kur A&s;an</HI> Pa&s;ha, an old Souldier, Pri&s;oner, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of <HI>Mo&s;ul</HI> and <HI>Leska</HI> on the Per&s;ian Sea; and meeting no con&s;iderable op|po&s;ition, he divided his Army into four parts.

<P>Thus did the Turki&s;h Court &s;eek to ward off the blow of a War with <HI>Germany,</HI> and yet &s;e|cretly nouri&s;hed and encouraged it, by giving Orders to the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Buda</HI> to take up his Win|ter-quarters with the Prince of <HI>Tran&s;ylvania,</HI> and to follow his Directions; but yet &s;o to go|vern Matters with Caution, as not to engage too far on uncertain Grounds or doubtful Hazard, but to embrace Propo&s;itions of Peace, if offered with Honour and Security.

With the&s;e Encouragements, and with the fa|vour of a good Opportunity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Empe|ror's Army defeated.</NOTE> the Confederates fell upon the Army of <HI>Walle&s;tein</HI> near the River <HI>Gran;</HI> who not being able to with&s;tand their Force and Fury, was put to flight, and pur&s;ued in the Rear with great &s;laughter; and endea|vouring to pa&s;s the River on two Bridges of Boats, were clo&s;ely followed by the Prince's For|ces, who gaining the Pa&s;s, put the whole Army into great amazement, and re&s;olved to pur&s;ue them to the Gates of <HI>Presburg,</HI> or <HI>Vienna.</HI></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this Succe&s;s, the Prince of <HI>Tran&s;ylvania</HI> ob&s;erving the backwardne&s;s of his Allies to contribute the Succours of Men and Mo|ny which they had promi&s;ed; and fearing that the unfortunate E&s;tate of the Turki&s;h Affairs &s;hould cau&s;e the Sultan to di&s;own the War, di&s;peeded a Me&s;&s;enger to the Emperor in the Winter-&s;ea&s;on, to excu&s;e the Con&s;traint upon him of taking up Arms, and to offer Terms of Accommodation and Peace. But the Emperor refu&s;ed all Treaties, until &s;uch time as <HI>Gabor</HI> had &s;eparated him&s;elf from his Allies, and from a&s;&s;o|ciation with the Turk: Upon which An&s;wer, <HI>Gabor</HI> retired to <HI>Ca&s;&s;ovia,</HI> and <HI>Morteza</HI> to <HI>Pe&s;th.</HI> This Compliance gave beginning to a Treaty at <HI>Komara,</HI> where the Commi&s;&s;ioners on part of the Emperor, of the Grand Signior, and Prince of <HI>Tran&s;ylvania,</HI> a&s;&s;embled. All Parties &s;eemed inclinable to War, and yet with occult Intenti|ons to make Peace, being nece&s;&s;itated thereunto by the urgency of their di&s;tinct Intere&s;ts.

</LIST></Q>
<P>By the&s;e Articles we may ob&s;erve, that both Parties were de&s;irous of a pre&s;ent Peace, rather than one which was durable; for things are &s;o &s;lubber'd over to &s;erve the pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion, that they leave all Di&s;putes undecided, till Time &s;hould happen more proper to interpret them with the Sword, than with the Pen: like Sores ob|ducted by an unskilful Chirurgion, which fe&s;te|ring within, mu&s;t be again opened before they are cured: how&s;oever they &s;erved the turn of <HI>Gabor,</HI> who&s;e Intere&s;t it was to maintain an ill Corre&s;pondence between the two Emperors.</P>
<P>Peace being thus concluded between <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Second and Sultan <HI>Morat,</HI> gave &s;ome reputa|tion to the Affairs of the Turks: &s;o that not|with&s;tanding the late &s;ucce&s;s of the Per&s;ian in their War, by rai&s;ing the Siege of <HI>Bagdat,</HI> and overthrow of the Turki&s;h Army; yet that King finding him&s;elf now engaged alone, and &s;ingly to contend with the Ottoman Power, feared the Pui&s;&s;ance of that Empire, le&s;t being rou&s;ed and heated with the &s;en&s;ible Pinches of the late Di&s;|grace, they &s;hould call up and invigorate all their Forces to a Revenge, which might at length tend to a ruin and de&s;truction of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> unle&s;s For|tune, which attended the fir&s;t au&s;picious begin|nings with Succe&s;s, did al&s;o continue con&s;tant, and &s;till accompany their Arms, which could hardly be expected.</P>
<P>Wherefore on the&s;e Con&s;iderations becoming more faint in pro&s;ecution of the War, the Per|&s;ian di&s;patched an Amba&s;&s;ador to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> furni&s;hed with various Propo&s;als and Projects for a Peace; but &s;till Mattters driving &s;o as to re&s;erve the City and Province of <HI>Bagdat,</HI> or <HI>Babylon,</HI> in the hands of the Per&s;ian, the Treaty became in|effectual, in regard the Vizier (who was then called <HI>Halil</HI> Pa&s;ha) judged it a high and an irre|coverable di&s;reputation to the Empire, to be di&s;|membred of &s;o principal a part of it. Where|fore the Amba&s;&s;ador being di&s;patched away with &s;ome neglect, the Turks armed with that dili|gence and heat, that they entred <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> with an Army of an hundred and fifty thou&s;and Men; with which appearance the people being di&s;may|ed, &s;uffered <HI>Tauris</HI> to be taken without much op|po&s;ition. From hence marching to <HI>Bagdat,</HI> they
<PB N="9" REF="7">found the City well provided and defended with a numerous Gari&s;on, from whence many Sallies were made with variety of Fortune, till at length the Turki&s;h Souldiers being wearied and tired with ince&s;&s;ant labour and watchings, many of them fled from their Colours: and with &s;uch di|minutions, the Army being much abated in its Numbers, the Vizier withdrew them from the Per&s;ian Dominions.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Another Ex|pedition in|to <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>Some Months after the Turki&s;h Army being reinforced, the Vizier entring again into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> overthrew the Trucmen who oppo&s;ed him in his March, and de&s;troyed the Gregorians, who were Friends to the Per&s;ian, with a very great &s;laugh|ter; took <HI>Moroc</HI> their General, and cut off his Head: And adding to the&s;e Victories, the re|port of having taken &s;ome few incon&s;iderable Towns, his Expedition ended without other Ad|vantages, or Progre&s;s of their Arms. This ill Succe&s;s much troubled the Councils at <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople;</HI> for they con&s;idered that they had now waged an expen&s;ive, laborious War, for the &s;pace of three Years, without any Effect agree|able to the Blood and Charge which maintained it, but rather to the Lo&s;s and Damage of the Empire. The Souldiers abhorred the length and tediou&s;ne&s;s of the Way, and the mi&s;ery of the March, being to pa&s;s over va&s;t Countries and De&s;arts, where there was nothing be&s;ides Rocks, Sands, and Barrenne&s;s. Many Hor&s;es, Camels, and other Bea&s;ts of Burden, peri&s;hed for want of Nouri&s;hment; and where Provi&s;i|ons were to be had, the Price was &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, that the Timariots and other Souldiers had not a Pur&s;e to defray their Charges. The Enemy likewi&s;e was very &s;trong, for the Sofi was at the Head of forty thou&s;and brave Hor&s;e, which dai|ly infe&s;ted the Ottoman Camp, beat their Con|voys, and cut off their Provi&s;ions, and &s;o ob|&s;tructed them that they could not advance.</P>
<P>The Vizier <HI>Halil,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Propo&s;ition made by the Per&s;ian for a Peace.</NOTE> then General, being di&s;|couraged by the&s;e Di&s;a&s;ters, was inclinable to accept of the Propo&s;ition made by the Per&s;ian, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>Babylon</HI> &s;hould remain to his elde&s;t Son in Fee, and to his Heirs and Succe&s;&s;ors, acknow|ledging to the Grand Signior a Tribute as great as the yearly Revenue which proceeded from it, at the time when it was in the Hands of the Sul|tan. But this middle Way &s;eemed an Expedi|ent di&s;honourable to the Greatne&s;s of this Em|pire, and that which argued pu&s;illanimity and want of courage in the Government, and there|fore was rejected by the Council of State, as well as by the Military Men. How&s;oever the Per&s;ians taking their Mea&s;ures by the di&s;po&s;ition they di&s;covered in the Vizier thereunto, adventured to di&s;patch an Amba&s;&s;ador to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> with tender of the &s;ame Project; but as he was cold|ly and faintly received, &s;o he was in a few days di&s;patched with few words, and little re&s;pect, as if he had been &s;ent as a Spy to di&s;cover the State and Condition of the City,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rejected by the Turk.</NOTE> and the Incli|nation of the Prince, rather than to obtain any Benefit by the Treaty. For now <HI>Amurat</HI> grow|ing into Years, increa&s;ed in Spirit, and di&s;co|vered a Martial Courage; he began to leave his Delights, and Walks in Gardens, and the &s;ociety with his Mother and Women, and to a&s;&s;ume thoughts of War and Government: &s;uch as en|tertained him in &s;oftne&s;s and luxurious Pa&s;times, were reproved by the Mini&s;ters about him, and by them per&s;waded to buckle on his Armour, and to delight in Martial Exerci&s;es: So that now new Mea&s;ures were taken in all Affairs: And in the fir&s;t place, <HI>Halil</HI> the Great Vizier was recal|led from being General in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Darbiquier</HI> put into his Place; and though he was Brother-in-Law to the Grand Signior, yet being e&s;teemed at Court as a Per&s;on who had ama&s;&s;ed great Riches in his Employment, he was forced to di&s;gorge five hundred thou&s;and Crowns as an ea&s;e of his Burden, and an Atonement to pacify the Sultan for the Fault of his Misfortunes and ill Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>In the&s;e Times of Licentiou&s;ne&s;s and Revolt, the Pirats of <HI>Algier</HI> and <HI>Tunis,</HI> began al&s;o to ca&s;t off their Re&s;pect and Reverence to the Ottoman Empire;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pirats of <HI>Tunis</HI> and <HI>Algier</HI> trouble the Seas.</NOTE> for being become Rich by the Prizes they had taken on Chri&s;tian Ve&s;&s;els, they re&s;ol|ved to &s;et up for them&s;elves, and to e&s;teem the Peace which Chri&s;tian Princes had made with the Grand Signior, not to concern them; but as if their Governments had been independent, de|manded a particular Treaty, and di&s;tinct Arti|cles with them&s;elves: So that now daring to do any thing, &s;ix Ve&s;&s;els of <HI>Tunis</HI> cha&s;ed &s;ome Chri|&s;tian Ships into <HI>Rhodes,</HI> and there attaqued them, notwith&s;tanding that the Ca&s;tle &s;hot at them. They afterwards took a Dutch Ship, which had laden at <HI>Alexandria:</HI> and entring the Port of <HI>Salines</HI> in <HI>Cyprus,</HI> they engaged with two Vene|tians; the le&s;&s;er Ship made a good re&s;i&s;tance, but having no help, &s;he was thrice fired, and at la&s;t burnt: the other being a Ship of eight hundred Tuns, was cowardly &s;et on fire by the Mariners, and abandoned, e&s;caping a&s;hore with their Boats. Then they &s;ailed for <HI>Scanderone,</HI> where finding a Dutch Ship and a Polaca, they took both, and then landed. The Aga of the Scale, with all the Inhabitants, fled; &s;o that finding no oppo&s;ition, they ran&s;acked and robbed all the Ware-hou&s;es, and afterwards &s;et them on fire: The greate&s;t Lo&s;s fell upon the Engli&s;h and Dutch, the fir&s;t lo&s;t about ten thou&s;and Dollars, and the latter about thirty thou&s;and.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e Lo&s;&s;es, and breach of Peace, the Chri&s;tian Amba&s;&s;adors much lamented; and complained, that if &s;ome Remedy were not ap|plied thereto, all Trade mu&s;t be given over, no Security being to be expected in the Articles and Faith of the Grand Signior: To which, though the Vizier and Great Men did &s;eem to yield a fa|vourable Ear, and promi&s;e Redre&s;s: Yet being corrupted with &s;ome &s;hare of the Spoils, and &s;weetned with part of the Robbery, they began to reject the Memorials of the Amba&s;&s;adors, and to allow the Pleas of the Pirats, as grounded on &s;ome &s;olid Foundation of Rea&s;on and Religion: &s;uffering them to publi&s;h Di&s;cour&s;es, that the Turks were obliged to maintain a perpetual War with the Chri&s;tians, as Enemies to their Law and Alchoran; and though Policy may &s;ugge&s;t &s;ome Conveniencies by Peace with them, yet tho&s;e Con&s;iderations are Matters of Sin rather than of Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>To make all this good, the Divan of <HI>Tunis</HI> &s;ent two Deputies to remon&s;trate the great Benefit and Advantage the Port received by the Depre|dations and ho&s;tile Acts which they committed on the Chri&s;tians: And to inculcate this Argu|ment the better, they declared, That they had lately taken two Gallies of <HI>Malta,</HI> out of the Spoils of which, they pre&s;ented unto the Sultan two Stirrups of Gold, with divers Slaves; two of which were Cavaliers, one of the Roman, and the other of the French Nation: tho&s;e which were Youths, and comely in &s;hape and feature, were entred into the Service of the Seraglio; and the more &s;trong and robu&s;tous, were com|mitted to the Service of the Gallies; &s;o that the Turks were inwardly plea&s;ed with the&s;e Piracies, how&s;oever gave good words to the Chri&s;tian

<P>At that time Trade flouri&s;hed greatly in tho&s;e Parts, and had done much more, had it not been interrupted by the Piracies of <HI>Barbary;</HI> and the Trade was e&s;pecially &s;o great with <HI>Venice,</HI> that a Turki&s;h Merchant called <HI>Rodul</HI> Aga, who&s;e whole Negotiation and Dealing was for that place, died worth a Million of Soltanees; of which, for want of Children, the Grand Signior became the &s;ole Heir.</P>
<P>But one Accident happened about this Time on the Seas, worthy to be recounted: The Seas (as we have &s;aid) &s;warming then with Pirats, the General of <HI>Candia,</HI> with three Gallies, coa&s;t|ing on the Seas for defence and protection of Merchant-Ships, arrived in the Port of <HI>Andro;</HI> from whence e&s;pying a Gally plying clo&s;e under the Shore, and believing her to be a Cor&s;aire, or Pirat, made up to her; and becau&s;e it was a about the glimp&s;e of the Evening, &s;o that &s;he could not be well known or di&s;tingui&s;hed, the General ra&s;hly charged her; and meeting a &s;tout re&s;i&s;tance, many were killed before it was known that the Gally belonged to the <HI>Archipelago,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Fight at Sea by mi|&s;take.</NOTE> com|manded by <HI>Dervis Bei,</HI> one of the Grand Sig|nior's Captains: but &s;o &s;oon as the Mi&s;take was di&s;covered, the Candiot General demanded of the Turk a thou&s;and Excu&s;es, returned him his Gally and Slaves again, and what&s;oever was ta|ken from him, be&s;towing with them an infinity of Complements, &s;uppo&s;ing that thereby the Spirit of the Turk being &s;omewhat appea&s;ed and mollified, he would repre&s;ent this Encounter with the more favourable Terms and Advantage at the Port. Notwith&s;tanding which Offices of Kindne&s;s, <HI>Dervis Bei,</HI> without farther lo&s;s of time pa&s;&s;ed up to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> bringing his Gally in without Lantern, &s;hot thorough, ill treated, and &s;hattered, feigning him&s;elf al&s;o to be wounded; related, that he had lo&s;t forty four Levents, and &s;eventy &s;even Slaves which were killed; and that all the Haratch or Tribute-Mony, which was collected for the Grand Signi|or's Service from the &s;everal I&s;lands, was rob|bed and embezled by the&s;e Candiots. His Com|plaints were aggravated by many Circum&s;tan|ces, and being a&s;&s;i&s;ted with the Clamours of other Beys or Captains of Gallies; the Noi&s;e and Di&s;pute was exceeding high in the Divan, urg|ing, that the Venetians were obliged to make good a Lo&s;s, which they had cau&s;ed rather out of Malice than Mi&s;take.</P>
<P>At that time <HI>Georgio Giu&s;tiniano</HI> re&s;ided at <HI>Con|&s;tantinople</HI> for the mo&s;t Serene Republick; who to oppo&s;e the high Clamours of the&s;e Complai|nants, &s;hewed Courage, and accompanied his An&s;wers with Prudence and Re&s;olution, which are often very convincing in the Turki&s;h Court. They alledged, that the Peace was broken. He an&s;wered, That it would not be the fir&s;t time; and that they ought not to yield entire Credit to the Relation of Per&s;ons pa&s;&s;ionate and partial in their own Cau&s;e: that &s;uch Accidents as the&s;e, were as ordinary and common in the World as Cold and Heat, as fair and foul Weather; and that &s;o &s;oon as the Error was di&s;covered, and the Gally known not to belong to <HI>Barbary,</HI> but to the Grand Signior, it was punctually and en|tirely, re&s;tored, with all the Excu&s;es imagina|ble.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, this Bu&s;ine&s;s which had &s;o bad an A&s;pect at the fir&s;t, by the dexterity of this Mi|ni&s;ter, and giving &s;omething to <HI>Dervis Bei,</HI> where|by to &s;top his Mouth, the Complaint cea&s;ed, and all farther Proceedings were &s;uper&s;eded.</P>
<P>The Wars in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> being un&s;ucce&s;sful, it was propo&s;ed in Council, that a Peace &s;hould be made, if po&s;&s;ible, with <HI>Aba&s;&s;a</HI> Pa&s;ha; that his Demands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Propo&s;als of Accommo|dation with <HI>Aba&s;&s;a.</HI></NOTE> what&s;oever they were, &s;hould be granted, and promi&s;es given him of Honours and Preferment: But the inveterate Enmity and Hate which the Jani&s;aries bore him, and the difficulty there was to per&s;wade <HI>Aba&s;&s;a,</HI> that the Overtures made him were free and candid, and not mixed with Treachery and De&s;ign, were Ob&s;tructions not to be obviated or overcome. Wherefore <HI>Aba&s;&s;a</HI> keeping mutual Intelligence with the Per&s;ians, and receiving a&s;&s;i&s;tance and &s;uccours from them, was become very formidable and &s;trong, and the Town of <HI>Erzirum</HI> well fortified with Works and a numerous Garri&s;on. How&s;oever the Jani|&s;aries, his mortal Enemies, pre&s;&s;ing the Vizier to proceed again&s;t him, at length obliged him to be&s;iege the Place; which having done, and clo&s;ely begirt it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Erzirum <HI>be&s;ieged.</HI></NOTE> the mo&s;t forward and brave a|mong&s;t the Jani&s;aries, were the fir&s;t to &s;cale the Walls, but were repul&s;ed by the valour of &s;tout and re&s;olute Souldiers; for they knowing that there was no other &s;afety but in their Arms, and no other Mercy than an ignominious Death, be|ing the ju&s;t Reward of their Rebellion, refu&s;ed to give or receive Quarter: Wherefore they made frequent Sallies on the Enemy, and as ma|ny Jani&s;aries of them as they took Pri&s;oners, they immediately hanged about the Walls, as a &s;pectacle of Horror to their A&s;&s;ociates. This Re&s;olution and Cruelty, deterred the Turks from their frequent A&s;&s;aults and Storms made upon the Town; and the many Batteries and Fortifi|cations, rendred the Place almo&s;t impregnable; &s;o that there &s;eemed no other hopes to remain, but to overcome them by a long Siege and Fa|mine: But <HI>Aba&s;&s;a</HI> had &s;o well provided again&s;t this Danger, with &s;uch plenty of Provi&s;ions, that the Turki&s;h Army began to be more &s;trait|ned for want of Su&s;tenance than the Be&s;ieged: &s;o that becoming weary and di&s;couraged amid&s;t &s;o many Difficulties, they rai&s;ed the Siege with &s;uch di&s;order and ha&s;te,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Siege rai&s;ed.</NOTE> that they left &s;everal Pieces of Cannon behind them; and retiring with &s;ome confu&s;ion, were charged in the Rear, &s;o that many Jani&s;aries fell a Sacrifice to the hate and revenge of the Enemy.</P>
<P>The News of this Succe&s;s coming to <HI>Con&s;tan|tinople,</HI> was ill received; but the Di&s;a&s;ter there|of, according to the u&s;ual Cu&s;tom, was attribu|ted to the Vizier who was General; for which Cau&s;e he was deprived of his Office, and the Se|lictar Aga (who carries the Sword before the Grand Signior) was put into his place, a Per|&s;on of a fierce, bloody, and cruel Di&s;po&s;i|tion.</P>
<P>To the&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">New Trou|bles from <HI>Tattary.</HI></NOTE> new troubles were added out of <HI>Tartary.</HI> For <HI>Mahomet</HI> the King of that Coun|try, exalted to the Princely Dignity (as we have already declared) by the Favour and Election of that People, though contrary to the &s;en&s;e and plea&s;ure of the Port, was now fallen from the good e&s;teem which they conceived for him, be|cau&s;e he gave &s;ome hindrance to their u&s;ual In|cur&s;ions on the Polonians and Co&s;&s;acks, out of memory and gratitude to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance they had contributed towards his Election; for which rea|&s;on being, as it were, fami&s;hed for want of their u&s;ual Depredations, they refu&s;ed to obey his Commands; and then openly threw off their Obedience to him as their Prince. The Turks, who always envied this Dignity to <HI>Mahomet,</HI> rejoiced to &s;ee this Di&s;cord between him and his People, and therefore thought it time to make u&s;e of this occa&s;ion to re-in&s;tate <HI>Gherey</HI> the elder
<PB N="11" REF="8">Brother into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Kingdom; whom the Turks, for his better &s;ecurity, having placed at <HI>Rhodes,</HI> the u&s;ual Retirement of the Tartarian Princes, di&s;patched a Squadron of Gallies to fetch him from thence to <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> where being arrived, he was received with a magnificent and Princely Entertainment by the Sultan: that &s;o the Fame thereof forerunning his arrival in <HI>Tartary,</HI> the people might be better prepared to concur with the Port in their ac|ceptance of him for their King. He was after|wards conducted to <HI>Caffa,</HI> the Grand Signior's Town in <HI>Tartary,</HI> with a &s;trong Fleet of fifty Gallies, where at his fir&s;t landing he was received by <HI>Cant-Emir,</HI> a rich and powerful Tartar, and Chief of the Turki&s;h Faction, and by many o|thers with great honour and &s;olemnity, with whom al&s;o a con&s;iderable Party mo&s;t willingly en|gaged. But the Co&s;&s;acks of <HI>Poland</HI> and Circa&s;|&s;ians, Friends to <HI>Mahomet</HI> the Brother, joyning their Troops to his Forces, became too Strong for the Turks; for giving them Battel near the Inclo&s;ures of the <HI>Danube,</HI> at a place called <HI>Ban|det,</HI> they defeated them, and killed three or four thou&s;and of their Men, putting all to Fire and Sword round about; and entring on the Seas with their Fleet of Boats, took five of the Tur|ki&s;h Gallies: with which ill Succe&s;s, the Tar|tars, which took part with <HI>Cant-Emir,</HI> being di&s;couraged, abandoned their Colours and fled; &s;o that <HI>Cant-Emir</HI> was forced to take Sanctu|ary in <HI>Caffa,</HI> which being a Town belonging to the Grand Signior, it was hoped, that the re|verence they owed to that Name, would cau&s;e them to refrain all Violence thereunto. But the Tartars, provoked by this late effu&s;ion of Blood, lo&s;t all re&s;pect to that Government; &s;o that be|&s;ieging the Town, they a&s;&s;aulted and took it, and therein the Son of <HI>Cant-Emir</HI> whom they cut in pieces, the Father e&s;caping in a di&s;gui&s;e from the City.</P>
<P>The News hereof arriving at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> was greatly di&s;plea&s;ing, and cau&s;ed many &s;erious Debates and Con&s;ultations thereupon; the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t &s;ober of the Council was for di&s;&s;em|bling the Matter, and with their u&s;ual dexterity to &s;uffer what they could not remedy: for that it was by no means advi&s;able in the pre&s;ent con|juncture of Affairs, to proceed unto an open Rupture with the Tartars, fearing le&s;t the Chri|&s;tians, Per&s;ians, and other Enemies &s;hould make a benefit of this Occa&s;ion, and joyning with a Nation &s;o &s;trong in Hor&s;e, &s;hould dangerou&s;ly pre&s;s upon the Empire, and force them to the ultimate extremity of Affairs. Wherefore an Envoy Extraordinary was &s;ent to the Tartars, who covering the inward &s;entiments of Regret and Anger, which the Sultan conceived for the late Di&s;grace, &s;eemed to wonder at the Cau&s;e and Rea&s;on of the la&s;t Engagement, as if it had been acted without the knowledg or order of the Grand Signior; and thus with gentle Terms in|&s;inuating, that the Surrender of <HI>Caffa</HI> would be very acceptable to the Port, and that which would atone for all mi&s;carriages, and be &s;uch an offering of Pacification, as would reconcile all pa&s;t Differences, and re&s;tore a perfect Corre&s;pon|dence between the Sultan and them: the Tartars readily a&s;&s;ented to the Demand, upon condition, that the Turks &s;hould impo&s;e no other King upon them than him, whom by general con&s;ent they had elected for their Prince.</P>
<P>Though Differences were thus concluded with the Tartars, yet the Co&s;&s;acks continued &s;till their Enmities, entring the Black Sea with eighty Saicks, which they &s;o infe&s;ted, that the Turks could for that Year avail them&s;elves little of their Navigation in tho&s;e Seas: &s;o that the Turks, to curb the&s;e In&s;olencies, gave Orders to build two Forts at the Mouth of the Black Sea: the Poli&s;h Amba&s;&s;ador made Complaint hereof, and prote&s;ted again&s;t it, as an Act contrary to the Capitulations of Peace; but the Turks e&s;teem little of the Air of Bravadoes, whil&s;t they are not accompanied with &s;omething el&s;e more &s;olid than their own Levity.</P>
<P>But the grand Concernments which bu&s;ied the Thoughts of the Turks, was the Rebellion of <HI>Aba&s;&s;a,</HI> and the War in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> the management of which was the charge and care of the Selictar Aga lately made Vizier, called <HI>Serches</HI> Pa&s;ha. His Head-quarters were at the beginning of this Year taken up at <HI>Iconium,</HI> called by the Turks <HI>Conie;</HI> and <HI>Aba&s;&s;a</HI> was encamped at <HI>Kai&s;aria,</HI> a|gain&s;t whom the Vizier marched; and being nearly approached, the Jani&s;aries earne&s;tly ur|ged, that Battel might be given the Enemy; but the Vizier having received In&s;tructions not to en|gage, if po&s;&s;ible, but rather to enter into a Trea|ty, and to propo&s;e Terms of Accommodation, delayed the Time, and with various Excu&s;es, eluded the pre&s;ent premures of the Jani&s;aries; at which they became &s;o angry, that they flew into an open Mutiny,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Jani&s;a|ries mutiny.</NOTE> cutting the Cords of his Tents, &s;toning him, and wounding him in the Head: by which open Violence, the Vizier being compelled to make known his Orders, he a&s;&s;em|bled the chief Commanders of the Spahees and Jani&s;aries, giving them to under&s;tand, that the Grand Signior's Plea&s;ure was, to make up the Difference with <HI>Aba&s;&s;a,</HI> as the only means to con|clude an inte&s;tine and unnatural War, and to be able to with&s;tand the Per&s;ians, and regain the Country and Reputation which the Turks had lo&s;t. This Propo&s;ition &s;eemed plau&s;ible to the Commanders at the General A&s;&s;embly, and more e&s;pecially, becau&s;e it was the Plea&s;ure and In|junction of the Grand Signior; but more difficult it was to incline the rough and ob&s;tinate minds of the Jani&s;aries to a re&s;olutian &s;o different to their Natures, and &s;o contrary to that Revenge which they had deeply rooted in their Hearts, and &s;worn to execute: how&s;oever the per&s;wa&s;ions which the Officers u&s;ed to their inferiour Souldiers, put|ting them in memory of the Blood of their Com|panions, and how de&s;tructive the continuance of &s;uch a War mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily prove for the future by tho&s;e large effu&s;ions of Blood which they mu&s;t expect farther to make, were &s;o prevalent upon them, that at length they conde&s;cended to a Treaty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They con&s;ent to treat with <HI>Aba&s;|&s;a.</HI></NOTE> and to receive <HI>Aba&s;&s;a</HI> for a Friend and a Fellow-Souldier. <HI>Aba&s;&s;a</HI> at fir&s;t &s;u&s;pecting &s;ome Treachery, refu&s;ed to give a private meeting to the Vizier; but the Vizier giving his Brother the Beglerbegh of <HI>Caramania,</HI> and the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Anatolia</HI> for Ho&s;tages, the Day and Place for a Conference was appointed; where both Parties meeting, Articles were agreed, That <HI>Aba&s;&s;a</HI> &s;hould &s;till continue to be Pa&s;ha of <HI>Erzirum,</HI> his Son Pa&s;ha of <HI>Bo&s;ra,</HI> his Cahya, or Lieutenant, to be Pa&s;ha of <HI>Mara&s;ch,</HI> (all which were Places on the Confines of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI>) a general Act of Par|don and Amne&s;tie was to be given to <HI>Aba&s;&s;a</HI> and his whole Army, and the Articles &s;worn unto in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner by the Vizier, and confirmed in the publick Camp of the Jani&s;aries, who al&s;o promi&s;ed to maintain this Word and Promi&s;e of the Vizier; to all which the Grand Signior gave his Hand, and affixed his Royal Sig|nature.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Aba&s;&s;a</HI> re|conciled to the Grand Signior.</NOTE></P>
<P>A Reconciliation being in this manner, com|pleated, the City of <HI>Erzirum</HI> re&s;igned it &s;elf to
<PB N="12" REF="9">the Obedience of the Grand Signior, and the Army of <HI>Aba&s;&s;a</HI> was employed on the Confines of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and converted again&s;t the Enemy. The Vizier al&s;o was appointed to proceed on the &s;ame Enterpri&s;e; but his Army was &s;o ill provided of all Nece&s;&s;aries, that he made his Ex|cu&s;e, and refu&s;ed to march forward: But on the contrary, he returned to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> in company with <HI>Aba&s;&s;a;</HI> where, with many demon|&s;trations of Friend&s;hip and Re&s;pect, he was conducted to the pre&s;ence of the Grand Signior to receive Honour, and the Reward of his Peni|tence, and return to Obedience. The approach of the&s;e two great Per&s;onages near to <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople,</HI> made much noi&s;e and rumor in the City; &s;ome blamed the weakne&s;s of the Government for accepting an Enemy unto Favour, and that the crowning of his Rebellion with Rewards, was to encourage others in the like Practi|ces.</P>
<P>The Vizier was al&s;o murmured again&s;t for leaving the Army and the War,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Vizier and <HI>Aba&s;&s;a</HI> make their Entry into <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople.</HI></NOTE> contrary to the Royal Command, by &s;uch as were emulous of his Greatne&s;s: But as Envy is converted into Veneration, and cea&s;es as Smoke doth, when it is blown up by the Flame of Succe&s;s and Glory; &s;o tho&s;e who were emulous of the&s;e Per&s;ons, &s;ub|mitted to all ob&s;equious Offices towards them; and di&s;&s;embling their Malice, went to meet them as far as <HI>Scutari,</HI> that they might add to their Train and Equipage, and help at the Solemnity of their Entrance. All People now ca&s;t their Eyes on the Vizier and <HI>Aba&s;&s;a,</HI> as the two great Men of this Age; the fir&s;t was e&s;teemed for his dexterous and &s;ucce&s;sful management in bring|ing over <HI>Aba&s;&s;a</HI> to his Submi&s;&s;ion and Obedience; for though he was not famed much for his great Feats of Arms, yet this Reconciliation of <HI>Aba&s;&s;a</HI> was accounted a Ma&s;ter-piece of Policy, and better Service than a Victory. <HI>Aba&s;&s;a</HI> al&s;o drew the Eyes of the People, who crowded to &s;ee &s;o great a Captain, that could contend with the Port, and put all <HI>A&s;ia</HI> into Di&s;turbance, and in conclu&s;ion could make the &s;ame Arms &s;erve his Ma&s;ter, which had lately before given a check and &s;top to all the Ottoman Force. The Vizier was the fir&s;t introduced to the Royal Pre&s;ence, where being graciou&s;ly received, he was pre&s;en|ted with a Ve&s;t of Sables and a Cemiter &s;et with Jewels. <HI>Aba&s;&s;a</HI> was afterwards admitted, and having performed his Obei&s;ance by touching the Ground with his Forehead after their fa&s;hion; he declared, That he never was other than a faithful Va&s;&s;al to the Sultan, and that he had ta|ken up Arms for his &s;ake, that he might &s;ubju|gate the in&s;olence of the Jani&s;aries, and with their Blood revenge the Death, and &s;acrifice to the Gho&s;t of his murdered Brother <HI>O&s;man,</HI> that they might learn to reverence their Princes for the future, &amp; learn to know how &s;acred the Blood is of their Soveraign. The Grand Signior &s;eemed kindly to accept this Apology, and as a Token thereof, be&s;towed three Ve&s;ts upon him; which was a treble Honour of that kind, and made him Pa&s;ha of <HI>Bo&s;na;</HI> on which employ|ment he immediately entred: And though when &s;uch offices are be&s;towed, it is commonly the cu|&s;tom for that Per&s;on, who is inve&s;ted in the Em|ployment given, to ki&s;s the Sleeve of the Grand Signior publickly by way of Thanks: Yet, le&s;t &s;uch Demon&s;tration of Honour &s;hould ill affect the Eyes of the Jani&s;aries, and cau&s;e murmuring and repinings among&s;t the mo&s;t envious of the Souldiery, his la&s;t Audience was de&s;igned pri|vately, and his Di&s;patch procured in more &s;e|cret and familiar manner, and therefore more obliging than was u&s;ual.</P>
<P>To yield &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the pre&s;ent grow|ing Charges of the Empire, the Vizier impo&s;ed a heavy Tax on the Chri&s;tians and Jews; on the fir&s;t it was levied with all &s;everity;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Jews at <HI>Con&s;tan|tinople</HI> how treated</NOTE> but the Jews found more favour by their Arts, and &s;ecret ma|nagement of Affairs, for they are a People of &s;ome Authority and Power in <HI>Turkie:</HI> they are cur&s;ed by particular Per&s;ons, but care&s;&s;ed by the generality: they are Slaves in all Countries, and yet acquire &s;omewhat of Ma&s;ter&s;hip and Pro|priety: they are Vagabonds, and yet every Country is their own: they cannot buy lands, and yet daily increa&s;e their Fortunes: they mul|tiply in abundance, becau&s;e they all marry, and are not de&s;troyed by Wars: they are great Con|fidents of the Turks, and Enemies to the Chri|&s;tians. In &s;hort, Covetou&s;ne&s;s in <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> is like a publick Courti&s;an, to whom the Jews are the Panders and Ruffians.</P>
<P>The Grand Signior pa&s;&s;ing one day through the Streets, unhappily met with the Amba&s;&s;ador of the Prince of <HI>Tran&s;ylvania;</HI> who becau&s;e he did not immediately de&s;cend from his Hor&s;e in token of Reverence, he cau&s;ed him and his whole Family to be impri&s;oned; but being afterwards excu&s;ed by the Chimacam, to have only been a matter of inadvertency, his Omi&s;&s;ion was par|doned, and &s;o relea&s;ed from his Re&s;traint.</P>
<P>The Souldiery having for a long time been go|verned by a loo&s;e and gentle hand, continued their licentious way of living, committing ma|ny outrages on the Merchants and Inhabitants of <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> again&s;t which many Decrees having been publi&s;hed, and Proclamations made, without any effect or notice of the Souldiery, the Vizier was unwilling to dally longer; and therefore taking a Spahee and a Jani&s;ary, hanged them up, and cut off their Heads: and with &s;uch cour&s;e and method of Severity, he &s;o aba|ted the haughty Stomachs of the Souldiers al|ready mortified by the a&s;&s;umption of <HI>Aba&s;&s;a</HI> into favour, that they began to yield unto Command, and to behold their Rulers with an eye of Re&s;pect, as tho&s;e which were &s;eated in &s;ome degree above them&s;elves; for till now there was &s;carce a com|mon Jani&s;ary, but who thought him&s;elf to be the Creator or Elector of his General, and therefore to be little inferior to him in Power and Dignity.</P>
<P>And as this Vizier was &s;evere towards the Souldiery, &s;o he demeaned him&s;elf with equal rigour towards the Pa&s;ha's and Grandees of the Court; which though it was an Humor in the Vizier at that conjuncture, laudable and nece&s;&s;a|ry, yet it procured him &s;uch enmity, as removed him at a di&s;tance, and cau&s;ed him to be &s;ent into <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> to command the Army, and by that means to expo&s;e him to the hazard and difficulties of doubtful Succe&s;s in a dangerous War.</P>
<P>The Vizier being departed, the Grand Sig|nior appeared in publick on Hor&s;e-back, toge|ther with his Brother by his &s;ide, an unu&s;ual &s;ight among&s;t the Turks: But the Queen-Mother, who in ab&s;ence of the Vizier ruled much, commanded that it &s;hould be &s;o.

<P>This new King, to demon&s;trate his Prowe&s;s, and to act &s;omething acceptable to the Port, di&s;|patched forty thou&s;and Hor&s;e into <HI>Podolia</HI> and <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> to &s;ack and ravage the Country; which dividing them&s;elves into &s;everal Parties, made their Incur&s;ions as far as <HI>Socal.</HI> But in the mean time the Polonians and Co&s;&s;acks having formed a &s;trong Body of Hor&s;e under the Command of <HI>Stephen Chmieleskie,</HI> met them at their return near to <HI>Bur&s;tinow,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Tartars overthrown by the Po|landers.</NOTE> where they gave them a total overthrow. And in like manner <HI>Stani&s;laus Lu|bomiskie,</HI> encountred another Party, and over|threw them, leaving thirty thou&s;and &s;lain on the plaee, and taking two thou&s;and Pri&s;oners, among&s;t which was the younger Brother of the Tartar King.</P>
<P>This Defeat, as it was the greate&s;t that ever was given to the Tartars, &s;o it is probable, that had it been well pro&s;ecuted at that time by the Polonians, they might have entred the <HI>Cher&s;one|&s;us Tauricus,</HI> and without much oppo&s;ition have put an end to that Kingdom: But <HI>Sigi&s;mond</HI> King of <HI>Poland</HI> had other De&s;igns in hand; &s;uch mixed Monarchies as that, being better able to defend their own Dominions, than to acquire or conquer others.</P>
<P>To this News ill received at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> &s;u|pervened the unexpected Death of <HI>Bethlem Ga|bor;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Death of <HI>Bethlem Gabor.</HI></NOTE> unexpected, I &s;ay, becau&s;e that though he had been long labouring under the Di&s;ea&s;es of Drop&s;y and A&s;thma, yet the greatne&s;s of his Soul, and activene&s;s of his Spirit, ma&s;tered for a long time his Indi&s;po&s;ition, &s;o that he &s;eldom or never omitted his Coun&s;els and Bu&s;ine&s;s; and to the very time of his Death, was meditating and contriving De&s;igns, whereby to pre&s;erve his Dominions, and enlarge them. And in|deed the Government of <HI>Tran&s;ylvania</HI> required no le&s;s than &s;uch a &s;tirring Spirit: for being &s;eated between two &s;uch powerful Monarchs, as the Emperor and the Turk, there was need of dexterity and courage to &s;teer between the Rocks of &s;uch oppo&s;ite Intere&s;ts: Sometimes it was nece&s;&s;ary to join with one, and anon with the other. So <HI>Sigi&s;mond Battori</HI> Prince of <HI>Tran|&s;ylvania,</HI> uniting his Forces with the Emperor's, in &s;everal Conflicts overthrew the Turk, and kept the Scale in an equal Ballance. <HI>Gabor</HI> on the contrary inclined to the Turks, and &s;uppor|ted his Intere&s;t with the Ottoman Power, fol|lowing &s;uch Maxims as had been more ruinous to Chri&s;tendom, had he transferred them to a Son to imitate and pur&s;ue; but dying without I&s;&s;ue, the Government devolved to his Prince&s;s, by Vote of the States of the Country, and by Confirmation of the Turk, as we have already intimated.</P>
<P><HI>Gabor</HI> knew &s;o well how to deal and treat with the Turks, that he gained an abatement of ten thou&s;and Dollars of the annual Tribute; he managed his Affairs &s;o &s;ubtilly with the Empe|ror, that he was always invited to a Peace, and accordingly made his Advantage by the Treaty.</P>
<P>The other Princes of Chri&s;tendom in like man|ner courted him, and particularly the Cardinal <HI>Richelieu</HI> employed one <HI>Bornemis,</HI> a Gentleman of <HI>Tran&s;ylvania,</HI> a Lover of the French Intere&s;t, to be always about him; by who&s;e means, and with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of twenty thou&s;and Crowns of yearly Pen&s;ion, he obliged him to make War on the Emperor, at &s;uch Sea&s;ons as it &s;hould be in|timated unto him to be mo&s;t conducing to the advantage of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>At length, as we have &s;aid, giving way to mor|tality, he died on the <HI>15th</HI> of <HI>November,</HI> after he had reigned eighteen Years: he was a Prince of great Abilities, but exerci&s;ed them ill to the dam|mage of Chri&s;tendom; how&s;oever he was a Soul|dier of extraordinary Courage and Conduct, ha|ving begun to manage his Sword at &s;eventeen Years of Age; and as it is &s;aid, had been enga|ged in forty two &s;everal Fights. His Widow <HI>Ka|therine,</HI> Si&s;ter of the Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> rendred an account to the Port of this Accident, and the Grand Signior immediately returned An|&s;wer by <HI>Sulficar</HI> Aga, condoling the Misfortune, and encouraging her to a dependence on the Port: which &s;he accepting with due Re&s;entment, pro|mi&s;ed Obedience to the Grand Signior, and beg|ged his Protection. But the weather was too boi|&s;terous and rude for a Ve&s;&s;el to be navigated well under the Pilotage of a Woman; for the &s;ituati|on of the Country, between two mighty and po|tent Monarchs, required more than a Feminine Mind and Courage to free and defend it from the Plots, Snares, and Violence with which it was, as with a toile, encompa&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e two great <HI>Nimrods</HI> of the Ea&s;t and We&s;t. And though the Sultan undertook to defend his Female Ally, yet the diver&s;ion of the Ottoman Arms in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> the inte&s;tine Di&s;tractions, and the Minority of the Emperor were &s;uch burdens on the Foundation of Empire, and ob&s;tructions to great and Hero|ick Atchievements in behalf of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Prin|ce&s;s, that all the Promi&s;es made to her were un|available and ineffectual. For <HI>Stephen Bethlem,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Widow of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> Gabor</HI> per|&s;waded to quit her Go|vernment.</NOTE> a Kin&s;man of the decea&s;ed Prince, a Man con&s;pi|cuous in his own Per&s;on and E&s;tate, as well as for the &s;everal Governments divided among&s;t his Sons, and the intere&s;t he had gained in his Coun|try, procured means to convoke the States at <HI>Claudiopolis;</HI> and in&s;inuating the foregoing Incon|veniences of a Female Government, &s;o prevailed with the A&s;&s;embly, that they per&s;waded the Prin|ce&s;s to yield up her Soveraignty to <HI>Stephen Gabor,</HI> as one better capacitated for Rule and Soveraignty than her &s;elf. <HI>Stephen</HI> having thus obtained his intent, entred into a &s;erious Con&s;ultation with his Friends and Relations, whether he &s;hould la|bour to confirm the Government to him&s;elf, and entail it to the Family, or renounce it to &s;ome other. The fir&s;t &s;eemed a Matter very dubious and difficult; for that <HI>Bethlem Gabor</HI> his Prede|ce&s;&s;or, had di&s;obliged the principal Boyards or Barons of the Country, and thereby derived an envy and hatred to all his Family: His long and violent Government annexed to the Intere&s;t of the Turk, had not only rendred his Memory odious to his own People, but likewi&s;e to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> which would be ready to continue the like prejudice and aver&s;ion to any of the &s;ame Family, as it did to the la&s;t there|of.</P>
<P>For which Rea&s;ons, after due and mature con&s;ideration, it was re&s;olved to offer the Go|vernment to <HI>George Ragotskie,</HI> a Per&s;on rich in Mony, and of great Intere&s;t, by rea&s;on of the Juri&s;diction and Ca&s;tles which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in <HI>Hungary,</HI> belonging to his own paternal Inheri|tance; and in pur&s;uance thereof, they &s;ent <HI>Ste|phen</HI> the &s;econd Son, and <HI>Solomon</HI> a Kin&s;man of that Family, for Amba&s;&s;adors to <HI>Ragotski,</HI> re|pre&s;enting to him, that they had preferred his Merit before the Intere&s;t of their own Family;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Princi|pality offer|ed to <HI>Ra|gotski.</HI></NOTE> and therefore de&s;ired him, that he would be plea&s;ed to take upon him&s;elf the Regency of the Principality.</P>
<P>The offer of Government was a &s;avoury Bait to the Palate of <HI>Rogotski;</HI> which he embraced
<PB N="14" REF="10">with &s;ingular affectation and contentment, and was ea&s;ily per&s;waded on this occa&s;ion, to take a Journey to <HI>Waradin,</HI> one of the principal For|tre&s;&s;es and Places of con&s;ideration in that whole Province, and was there received by <HI>Stephen</HI> the Amba&s;&s;ador, Governor of the Citadel, with firing all the Cannon, and with the common Joy and Fe&s;tivity of the whole City. But in the mid&s;t of this Mirth, an unexpected Me&s;&s;enger arrived with News, that the States had with com|mon con&s;ent elected another Prince, which was <HI>Stephen Bethlem,</HI> Father of the Amba&s;&s;ador, and Author of this Coun&s;el.</P>
<P><HI>Ragotski</HI> was &s;trangely &s;urpri&s;ed with this In|telligence, and the Amba&s;&s;adors were put to the blu&s;h to &s;ee their Negotiations under &s;uch a &s;hameful defeat: How&s;oever re&s;olving to con|tinue con&s;tant to their fir&s;t Election, and to re|nounce the Intere&s;t of their own Family, they &s;till maintained the &s;ame ob&s;equious Offices of Honour and Reverence towards <HI>Ragotski</HI> as for|merly.</P>
<P>And notwith&s;tanding the Orders received from the States to ab&s;tain from any other demon&s;tra|tions of Honour to <HI>Ragotski,</HI> than what were or|dinary towards a private Per&s;on of his Quality and Riches; and that he &s;hould retire from the Confines of <HI>Tran&s;ylvania</HI> to the Precincts of his own Ca&s;tles: yet they &s;till per&s;i&s;ted to execute their fir&s;t Commi&s;&s;ion, and &s;o to attract People to his Party; that the number thereof daily in|crea&s;ing, it was at length agreed, that the fir&s;t Election not being fair, the Point in Controver&s;y &s;hould be determined at <HI>Sazburg,</HI> a City of <HI>Saxony.</HI></P>
<P>The States General being a&s;&s;embled, <HI>Ragotski</HI> accompanied his Preten&s;ions with a large effu&s;ion of Gold, the mo&s;t powerful and mo&s;t convincing Argument imaginable: to which he added, That he had no de&s;ign to affect the Principality, had not the &s;ame been fir&s;t offered to him from <HI>Ste|phen Gabor</HI> the Father by the Hand of his Son: That it was very improper for that Per&s;on to offer a Dignity to another, which he affected for him&s;elf: that it was in the power of the Tran|&s;ylvanians, not to have offered him the Princi|pality; but having once cho&s;en him to it, they could not, without his di&s;paragement and preju|dice, retract from their Election.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the&s;e Con&s;iderations, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Intere&s;t of the Prince&s;s Dowager, &s;o far pre|vailed, that <HI>Stephen Bethlem</HI> was put a&s;ide, and <HI>Ragotski,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ragotski</HI> cho&s;en Prince.</NOTE> who attended the &s;ucce&s;s of this Mat|ter at <HI>Waradin,</HI> was with common con&s;ent elected Prince; from whence being with great Accla|mations, and a general concour&s;e of the People, conducted to <HI>Alba Julia;</HI> he there took the u&s;ual Oath with much Solemnity and Magnificence: and with Princely Magnificence, entertained and treated the two Amba&s;&s;adors, <HI>Stephen</HI> and <HI>Solo|mon,</HI> and di&s;pen&s;ed freely his Mony unto divers, who before being Enemies, were now reconci|led, and become his Friends and Admirers. Li|berality in a Prince, is the mo&s;t re&s;plendent Gemm in all his Crown, and is a Light &s;o forcible, that it dazles Envy it &s;elf, and puts out all the Eyes of Su&s;picion and Jealou&s;y.</P>
<P>By this time the Great Vizier was far advan|ced with his Army into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> having been en|couraged to proceed by the feigned Flight, or rather Retreat of the Enemy, who burned, de|&s;troyed, and laid wa&s;te all round them, as they retired; which put the Turks to &s;uch inextrica|ble Difficulties, that in two months March, they had all the Inconveniencies and Mi&s;eries to con|tend with, which commonly attend Armies in &s;trange Countries; the Plains through which they travelled were abandoned by the Inhabi|tants, and void of Provi&s;ions; the Mountains were covered with Snow and comfortle&s;s: and what was wor&s;t, the Per&s;ians kept all the narrow Pa&s;&s;ages &s;o &s;trongly guarded, that the Vizier was now more in danger of Famine than of the Sword: but being a Per&s;on of great Sen&s;e and Experience in Military Affairs, he prudently di&s;|ingaged him&s;elf from the intricacy of the&s;e Dan|gers; and encamping his Army in the Plain of <HI>Amedan,</HI> he &s;o provoked the hot Spirits of the Per&s;ians, that they re&s;olve to a&s;&s;ault him on that &s;ide of his Camp, which they judged to be the mo&s;t weakly defended: of which having &s;ome adverti&s;ement, he &s;ecretly laid an Ambu&s;cado in the way; which &s;o happily &s;ucceeded, that he killed eight thou&s;and Per&s;ians on the place:<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Victory gained by the Turks over the Per&s;ians</NOTE> but how&s;oever the Victory co&s;t &s;o dear, and was &s;o bloody, by the lo&s;s of the &s;toute&s;t Jani&s;aries, and the brave&s;t of the Souldiery, that the News thereof made little noi&s;e or rejoycing at <HI>Con|&s;tantinople.</HI></P>
<P>With this Intelligence the Vizier demanded new Recruits; for that be&s;ides the abatement of his Numbers by the la&s;t Engagement, the Mul|titudes of the Enemy increa&s;ed, and his own Souldiers fled from their Colours; of which ma|ny being ob&s;erved to enter <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> not|with&s;tanding the &s;evere Decrees of Martial Law publi&s;hed again&s;t them, put the Grand Signior into a high Cholor and Indignation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The difficul|ty of &s;ending Men into <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></NOTE> And be|ing de&s;irous to reinforce the Vizier's Army with all the Recruits that he was able, Proclamations were made, that all the Militia at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> &s;hould immediately pa&s;s over unto <HI>Scutari</HI> under their re&s;pective Commanders; and that who&s;o|ver received one A&s;per of Pay from the Grand Signior in quality of a Souldier, &s;hould imme|diately pa&s;s the Chanel into <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and follow their Leaders to the War. But &s;o great was the abhorrency which the Souldiers had to this March into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> calling it the Sepulchre and Cemetery of the Turks, that few or none would obey, every one flying, hiding, and &s;hifting for him&s;elf as well as he could: During which Fears and Troubles, the Ways from <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> were &s;o ob|&s;tructed by the <HI>Curdes,</HI> that in the &s;pace of three or four Months, no News arrived at <HI>Con&s;tantino|ple</HI> from the Army; which cau&s;ed as great appre|hen&s;ions and affrightments there, as if the Em|pire had been reduced to the utmo&s;t extremity. Nor did the Sultan want Jealou&s;&s;es and Fears of receiving Affronts from the Emperor, and King of <HI>Poland;</HI> the fir&s;t of which had a fair oppor|tunity pre&s;ented of regaining all <HI>Tran&s;ylvania,</HI> e&s;pecially at a time when that Country was di|vided by two &s;everal Factions: but more pre&s;|&s;ing and trouble&s;om were the Co&s;&s;acks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Co&s;&s;acks trouble the Turks.</NOTE> who dai|ly infe&s;ted the Black &s;ea; and to the great re|proach of the Imperial City, perpetually di|&s;turbed it with Alarms, pa&s;&s;ing up almo&s;t in &s;ight of <HI>con&s;tantinople.</HI> Of which Complaints being made to the Polonian Amba&s;&s;ador, he an|&s;wered with &s;ome indignation, That the Co&s;|&s;acks had rea&s;on for what they acted; for that &s;ince the Tartars had, by Orders from the Grand Signior, made their late irruption into that Country, as they could well prove from the Commi&s;&s;ion taken among&s;t the Baggage of the Prince of <HI>Tartary</HI> in the la&s;t Defeat, the Co&s;&s;acks might with all ju&s;tice a&s;&s;ume to them&s;elves a me|thod of Revenge.</P>
<P>But the Grand Signior not being able to &s;up|port this Affront, or to &s;ee him&s;elf braved on the very Banks of his Imperial Seat, and his
<PB N="15" REF="10">Villages and Towns round about burnt and pil|laged by a crew of Free-booters and Pirats, ca&s;t all the blame on the Chimacham; to whom, in his rage, he gave &s;uch a blow with his Fi&s;t on the Face, that Blood i&s;&s;ued from his No&s;e; and had not the Queen-Mother interceded for him, he had been delivered into the Hand of the Executio|ner to take away his Life. Nor was the Cap|tain-Pa&s;ha in le&s;s danger at his return; becau&s;e, that upon his a&s;&s;urance, that the Co&s;&s;aks would not for that Year make any attempt in the Chanel of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> the Grand Signior had a&s;&s;ented, that the Fleet of Gallies &s;hould that Summer make a Voyage into the <HI>Archipelago:</HI> Which Mi&s;take having been the cau&s;e of all this Affront, the Captain-Pa&s;ha was to &s;hare in the blame, and had likewi&s;e in the puni&s;hment, had not good Friends interpo&s;ed between him and Danger.</P>
<P>Nor were the Co&s;&s;acks &s;atisfied with their late Plunder, but &s;peedily made another return with two hundred Boats; and though the whole Fleet of Gallies were then in Port, yet they had the boldne&s;s to proceed as far as <HI>Pompey</HI>'s Pillar, and thereby to hinder all Provi&s;ions from pa&s;&s;ing to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> by way of the Black-Sea. And what gave greater fear than all this, was the News which came at the &s;ame time, that the Poles were on the Frontiers with thirty thou&s;and Hor&s;e; to whom immediatly a Chaous, or Envoy was di&s;|patched with Propo&s;itions very advantagious to the Crown of <HI>Poland,</HI> conditionally, that the con|tinual Irruptions made by the Co&s;&s;acks &s;hould be &s;topped, and they re&s;trained within the due Terms of Peace and Moderation.</P>
<P>The Chaous found a civil Reception from the <HI>Poles,</HI> and promi&s;es of Compliance, in regard that the King had &s;ome Intentions of making War upon the Mu&s;covite.</P>
<P>But whil&s;t the&s;e things were in agitation, and that the Chaous was ready to return, behold, on a &s;udden News came, that ten thou&s;and Tar|tars were broken into <HI>Podolia;</HI> which put all things back again, and &s;o changed the &s;tile of Affairs, that in&s;tead of Articles of Peace, the Chaous was again returned with the Menaces of War, and with Reproaches for the la&s;t perfidi|ous Action.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e Troubles abroad, the pui&s;&s;ance of the Ottoman Empire might have been able to have &s;truggled with greater Difficul|ties, had not its own Inte&s;tine Di&s;tractions ren|dred all things dangerous, and of a malevolent A&s;pect.</P>
<P>The Government was at that time chiefly in the hands of the four Brothers-in-Law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Di&s;or|ders in the Ottoman State.</NOTE> who had married four Si&s;ters of the Grand Signior's; and for that rea&s;on were powerful, and employ|ed in the principal Offices of State, and com|monly drew contrary to the Opinions of the Mufti and Chimacham; which two la&s;t were not well accorded between them&s;elves, for that the latter encroached on the Office of the Mufti, to the great &s;candal and di&s;content of all the Reli|gious and Literate Men in the whole City; how|&s;oever they both joined in con&s;ultation by what means they might be&s;t &s;ecure them&s;elves and the Government from the Lu&s;ts and evil De&s;igns of this quadruple Fraternity; but their Wi&s;dom and Intere&s;ts were too weak to contrive Reme|dies again&s;t &s;uch high Oppre&s;&s;ions; for be&s;ides the Violences daily practi&s;ed by the Brothers, the extravagant Humors in the Sultan him&s;elf, ad|ded to the Di&s;orders of State, and increa&s;ed the Di&s;content and Di&s;&s;atisfactions of the People: For though <HI>Morat</HI> was naturally endowed with a good Wit and Parts, was &s;tout, and of a good Courage: yet as his perpetual Debauchery in Wine rendred him in appearance but of a weak Under&s;tanding, mixed with much Levity, &s;o it cau&s;ed his Acce&s;&s;ions of the Falling-&s;ickne&s;s (to which he was &s;ubject) to return often, whereby the &s;trength of his Brain was daily <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">akened and impaired. He was negligent al&s;o in the performance of tho&s;e Ceremonies which his An|ce&s;tors were accu&s;tomed to ob&s;erve; nor did he live with that gravity and regular Cour&s;e which is agreeable to the Grandeur of &s;o great a Prince: for &s;ometimes he would go out of his Seraglio with no other Attendance than of three or four Men, which were for the mo&s;t part Buf|foons, players upon the Gittern, and Eunuchs; and with no better an Equipage would he &s;ome|times be &s;een on Hor&s;e-back, or in his Boat rowed on the <HI>Bo&s;phorus</HI> with &s;ix Oars only: by which Actions, and other &s;allies of Youth, he created &s;uch a contempt towards his Per&s;on, that evil Men grew factious and weary, and en|tred into Con&s;piracies again&s;t his Life, whil&s;t the good Men feared and pre&s;aged the ruin and downfal of the Empire: for neither Ju&s;tice, nor Order, nor Obedience, prevailed; no Of|fices were conferred for Merit, but by Mony, or &s;ome other unlawful Means; there remained no Coun&s;ellors of true Faith and Integrity, nor Souldiers almo&s;t, either of experience for Sea or Land-adventures. The People, being bur|dened by double Taxes and Impo&s;ts, were muti|nous, and ready to take the lea&s;t Fire of Rebel|lion; the Souldiery were di&s;orderly for want of Di&s;cipline and their con&s;tant Pay: the Pa&s;ha's of remote Provinces grew in&s;olent, taking upon them&s;elves rather an ab&s;olute than a depending Soveraignty.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, all things looked with that black ap|pearance, that nothing &s;eemed to keep the Frame of Empire together, but only the expectation of good Succe&s;s to the Army in <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> the which, as it depended on uncertain Events, &s;o the Ot|toman Monarchy was then &s;haking, and &s;tood tottering on its deepe&s;t Foundation.</P>
<P>Wherefore all People being intent to hear of good News from <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> were much plea&s;ed to under&s;tand, that the Vizier having, by advan|tage in the la&s;t Engagement, laden his Army with Plunder and Spoils,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Vizier prepares to be&s;iege <HI>Bag|dat.</HI></NOTE> was now preparing to be&s;iege <HI>Bagdat;</HI> for who&s;e good Succe&s;s, Pray|ers were daily made in the Mo&s;chs; and the Schoolma&s;ters &s;urrounded the Streets with their young Scholars, &s;inging out Prayers with the <HI>Amen</HI> at every Period, according to the Cu&s;tom of that Country.</P>
<P>The Vizier marched towards <HI>Bagdat,</HI> and be|gan to be&s;iege it about the <HI>10th</HI> of <HI>September:</HI> In order whereunto, he ama&s;&s;ed great abundance of all &s;orts of Provi&s;ions, and made his Maga|zine of them at <HI>Mo&s;ul,</HI> two thou&s;and Camels, each laden with two Sacks of Cotton, every Sack being of about ten foot long, were carried to the Siege, for &s;helter of the Souldiery, and to fill the Ditches.</P>
<P>The Vizier having pa&s;&s;ed part of his Army over the River <HI>Tigris,</HI> the re&s;t with the Cannon remaining on the hither &s;ide, he di&s;patched <HI>Na|&s;uf</HI> Pa&s;ha of <HI>Aleppo,</HI> with &s;ix thou&s;and Spahees, to take a view of the Place, and to di&s;cover the Avenues unto it. In his way thither, he met with eight thou&s;and Per&s;ian Hor&s;e &s;ent to rein|force the Gari&s;on, which he valiantly engaged; but being dangerou&s;ly wounded, was forced to retreat, with the lo&s;s of almo&s;t half of his Men, part killed, and part taken: tho&s;e which

<P>Notwith&s;tanding this Di&s;a&s;ter at the begin|ning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Siege</NOTE> the Vizier nothing di&s;mayed, proceeded on his De&s;ign, &s;pending the whole Month of <HI>September</HI> in making his Approaches. In the Mouth of <HI>October,</HI> he mounted eighteen Pieces of great Cannon, which for the &s;pace of twenty five days bettered continually the Curtain be|tween the two Ba&s;tions, on which were four Pieces of Cannon not perceived by the Turks; there was al&s;o a deep and large Ditch not di&s;co|vered by them, for that it was planked over with Boards, and covered with a green Turf, &s;o that it appeared like plain and firm Ground: the Breach being made, and &s;eemingly undefended, the Turks re&s;olved to make an A&s;&s;ault; where|fore the Vizier, on the <HI>20th</HI> of <HI>November,</HI> com|manded, the Spahees, under the Conduct of the Beglerbei of <HI>Anatolia,</HI> accompanied with Pa|&s;ha's, Sangiacks, and other Per&s;ons of Note; as al&s;o with Jani&s;aries, to the number of thirty thou&s;and, to enter the Breach: which being performed, and great numbers crowding on the Turf, the weight of them pre&s;&s;ed down the Planks; and therewith the whole Engine giving way, five or &s;ix thou&s;and were in a moment ta|ken, as it were, in a Pit-fall, and &s;wallowed up without any po&s;&s;ibility of Succour to be yielded from their Companions. After which on an in|&s;tant there appeared fifteen thou&s;and Men on the Breach and on the Ba&s;tions; which with their Cannon, and continual Vollies of Musket &s;hot, &s;o galled the Spahees, that they broke their main Body, and killed the Beglerbei of <HI>Anatolia,</HI> with other Pea&s;ons of Note and Quality, and made the whole Army to retreat.</P>
<P>Two days after this Di&s;grace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Siege rai&s;ed.</NOTE> the Vizier rai|&s;ed the Siege, and marched towards <HI>Mo&s;ul;</HI> and the Per&s;ians encouraged with this Succe&s;s, pur&s;ued the Turks with eight thou&s;and Hor&s;e, a&s;&s;ailed the Rear-guard of the Enemy; and though the Conduct and Care thereof was com|mitted to the charge of the Pa&s;ha's of <HI>Aleppo</HI> and <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> yet the Per&s;ians killed three thou&s;and Turks, and had defeated the whole Rear of the Army, had not the Spahees turned their Hor&s;es, and with&s;tood the &s;hock with great Valour.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this di&s;honourable Retreat, the Vizier lo&s;t not his Courage, or hopes of taking the Town; in order unto which, he ap|pointed all things nece&s;&s;ary to renew the Siege again in the Months of <HI>September</HI> and <HI>October</HI> following, for that the foregoing Months are either too rainy, or too hot in tho&s;e Countries, to undertake a De&s;ign or Enterprize of that Na|ture: He fortified all the &s;mall Places in tho&s;e parts round, and quartered his Souldiers in them; &s;o that having all conveniencies of living, they might be induced to continue, and not abandon their Colours: e&s;pecially he took care to fortify <HI>Illay,</HI> a place of about two days journey from <HI>Bagdat,</HI> reinforcing the Gari&s;on with &s;ix thou|&s;and Men, under the command of three Begler|begs, in regard that it was a very con&s;iderable Pa&s;s, and the principal Magazine and Granary of Corn and other Provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time he &s;ent Letters to <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople,</HI> repre&s;enting the &s;tate of his Affairs to be in a hopeful condition; and de&s;iring Recruits both of Men and Mony, gave great a&s;&s;urances of conquering the City at the next Attempt.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Poles and Turks make Peace</NOTE></P>
<P>In this perrilous Condition of the Ottoman State, one would have imagined that Chri&s;tian Princes would have &s;een their own Intere&s;t, and made u&s;e of their advantage; but God not having as yet fixed a Period to the Bounds of this Empire, was plea&s;ed, by his &s;ecret Providence, to divert both the Emperor and King of <HI>Poland</HI> from making War with the Turk, inclining them to employ their Arms on their Chri&s;tian Neigh|bours. For though the Chaous (as we have &s;aid before) was returned from <HI>Poland</HI> with di&s;dain, and an angry Me&s;&s;age, yet the Chimacam, when he made <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> Vayvod of <HI>Moldavia,</HI> encharged him to perform all Offices of Mediation between the Grand Signior and the Poles, per&s;wading them to re&s;train the Incur&s;ions of the Co&s;&s;acks, and to &s;end an Amba&s;&s;ador to the Port. In which affair <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;o well performed his Nego|tiation, that applying Lenitives to the Anger of the Poles, he reduced them to Articles of Peace, and to promi&s;es of re&s;training the Co&s;&s;acks, on condition, that the Turks reciprocally forbid and withhold the Tartars from joining or af|fording a&s;&s;i&s;tance to his Enemies the Mu&s;co|vites.</P>
<P>The&s;e Conditions being agreed, the Amba&s;|&s;ador was &s;ent from <HI>Poland</HI> to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> where he was received with as much Joy, as he was expected with Impatience.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Co&s;&s;acks and Tartars compared.</NOTE> The Co&s;&s;acks and Tartars were two &s;orts of people which lived equally on Spoils and Booty; the fir&s;t as offenfive to the Turk, as the latter to the Pole; and therefore as it was an equal Benefit, &s;o it was an Agreement of even Terms, to counter|change the Caution given reciprocally for one and the other.</P>
<P>But the Engagement for &s;uch wild People, was more ea&s;ily given than performed; which becau&s;e it was a Point agreeable to both Par|ties, it was expre&s;&s;ed with the mo&s;t clear Words and &s;trict Terms po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The Poles were weary and grieved to &s;ee their Provinces depopulated by the Tartars, who yearly carried away &s;ome thou&s;ands of Souls. The Turks on the other &s;ide were not le&s;s infe|&s;ted with the Co&s;&s;acks, who captivated their People, burnt their Towns and Villages, and kept them in continual Alarms.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e the&s;e People are hardly re&s;trained from their Robberies and Pillaging, the Poles, as a Remedy, re&s;olved to carry the Co&s;&s;acks to the War again&s;t the Mu&s;covite; and better to &s;ecure the Tartar, the Poli&s;h Amba&s;&s;ador was obli|ged to pay them twenty thou&s;and Florins yearly, and &s;ix thou&s;and pair of Boots, according to the ancient Articles of Peace.

<P>In this manner were the Turks this Year freed from all apprehen&s;ions of Alarm from the Co&s;|&s;acks, and of War with <HI>Poland.</HI> And the Em|peror was &s;o bu&s;ied concerning the &s;urprize of <HI>Mantoua,</HI> and engaged in the Quarrel about that Dutchy, and with &s;ome ambitious thoughts relating to <HI>Italy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Troubles in <HI>Hungary.</HI></NOTE> that the Turks hoped to have pro&s;ecuted their Wars in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> without fear of Diver&s;ion from the We&s;tern Parts.

The jealou&s;y of tho&s;e ill Con&s;equences which this Commotion might produce, alarmed all the Country: and the Emperor and <HI>Ragotski</HI> being hereby rai&s;ed to a mutual Defiance, advanced their Troops one again&s;t the other upon the Frontiers: But all <HI>Hungary</HI> trembling with fear of tho&s;e Calamities which en&s;ue from War, &s;e|veral of tho&s;e concerned, interpo&s;ed &s;o far to|wards an Accommodation, that Deputies were ap|pointed to meet at <HI>Ca&s;&s;ovia</HI> to treat of Peace.

<P>In the month of <HI>September</HI> Sultan <HI>Morat</HI> being at his &s;mall Seraglio called <HI>Daout</HI> Pa&s;ha, and &s;leep|ing there one night in his Bed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The G.

<P>During all this time the Great Vizier wanting Succours and Supplies of Men and Mony, had great difficulty to contain his People in their due Obedience, or within the Bounds of their Quar|ters; for they were apt to leave their Colours, and would really have disbanded, had not their Spirits been daily held up with the hopes and a|mu&s;ements of Pay and Recruits.</P>
<P>The four Brethren-in-Law, which greatly ap|prehended le&s;t their Power and Authority &s;hould be abated by the return of the Vizier, exerci&s;ed all the diligence they were able to make new Levie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">, the reinforcement of which might in&s;til new Courage into the Souldiery, and be a means to continue the Vizier in tho&s;e parts; but the Mufti ob&s;tructed all Levies on the &s;ide of <HI>Greece,</HI> and the Frontiers of Chri&s;tendom, alledging, That the be&s;t Souldiers being &s;ent from tho&s;e parts, would hazard the Empire, by expo&s;ing and laying it open to the Incur&s;ions of the Chri|&s;tians: by which contrary Opinions and Delays, the Vizier wanting the A&s;&s;i&s;tance expected, the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> recovered all the little Fortre&s;&s;es which they had lo&s;t the Year before, with the con&s;ide|rable place of <HI>Illay;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Illay reta|ken from the Turks.</NOTE> which being taken by A&s;|&s;ault, and by an ab&s;olute force of Sword and Arms, the greate&s;t part of the Garri&s;ion con&s;i&s;t|ing of eight thou&s;and Men, commanded by the three Pa&s;ha's before-mentioned, where cut off; which was an important lo&s;s to the Turks; not only for the &s;laughter of &s;o many brave Soul|diers, but al&s;o for the quantities of Provi&s;ions, being the Granary and Magazine for the whole Army. Therein were likewi&s;e taken forty Field-pieces carrying eight pounds Bullet; with a great Chain of Iron, which u&s;ually encompa&s;&s;es the Trea&s;ury which is carried into the Field. With this ill &s;ucce&s;s the Vizier retreated from <HI>Mo&s;ul</HI> as far as <HI>Mirdin,</HI> from whence he re|doubled his In&s;tances for Supplies for Men and Mony.</P>
<P>At length it was agreed, that an Army of thirty thou&s;and Tartars &s;hould be &s;ent thither; but <HI>Ragotskie</HI> advi&s;ing, that he was upon the point of breaking with the Emperor, it was or|dered, that their number &s;hould be reduced to ten thou&s;and: the which taking their Journey into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> by the way of <HI>Circa&s;&s;ia,</HI> were there encountred by <HI>Han Gherey,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Tarta|ry,</HI> (whom we formerly mentioned to have been depo&s;ed by that People) and by him ob|&s;tructed in their pa&s;&s;age, the Van-guard of their Army being cut off by him; &s;o that they were forced again to retreat and to embark their Men and Hor&s;e at <HI>Caffa,</HI> to be tran&s;ported by Sea to <HI>Trapezond;</HI> which as it was a matter of great trouble, &s;o it was a cour&s;e unpracti&s;ed by the Tartars. The Grand Signior being unable to render a more con&s;iderable Succour than this un|to his Army, which was now reduced to the weak number of two thou&s;and Jani&s;aries, and three thou&s;and Spahees, he re&s;olved to conde|&s;cend to Terms and Articles, as the only means to &s;ave his Honour, and the remainder of his Forces.</P>
<P>In order unto which, he relea&s;ed a Per&s;ian Lord from his Impri&s;onment in the Seven Towers, and qualified him with the Title of Amba&s;&s;ador, be&s;towing upon him an Equipage of Men and Hor&s;e agreeable to his Character, with four tho&s;and Dollars to defray his Expence. And that the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> might be a&s;&s;ured of the Sultan's real Intentions and de&s;ires of Peace, he recalled his Army in the Spring, whereby all Acts of Ho&s;tility cea&s;ed: And thus the Vizier being returned to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> that Pride and Rigour which he exerci&s;ed towards all in the time of his pro&s;perity, laid him low by Misfor|tunes
<PB N="18" REF="12">tunes in the e&s;teem of his Enemies; who gladly embracing the opportunity to di&s;grace him, with all the terms of Obloquy and Detraction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Vizier deprived of his Office.</NOTE> deprived him at length of his Office. One of the four Brothers-in-law married to one of the Grand Signior's Si&s;ters, and Prime of the Cabal, being con&s;tituted Vizier in his &s;tead. Nor did the late Vizier ea&s;ily e&s;cape with his Life, until he had repreived it with an Atonement of an hundred thou&s;and Zechius of Gold, and &s;ome choice Hor&s;e, which he pre&s;ented to the Sultan; the like Example other Pa&s;ha's his Compainions followed in proportion to their E&s;tates and Em|ployments; by which Pre&s;ents the empty Trea|&s;ury was in a manner recruited, and the pre&s;ent Nece&s;&s;ities of the Sultan relieved.</P>
<P>But this new Vizier enjoyed not long either his Honours, or his Life; for the fir&s;t Act he per|formed, was to mitigate the <HI>Valed&eacute; Sultana,</HI> or Queen-Mother, to obtain a Hatte&s;heriff, or Writing, under the Grand Signior's Hand for cutting off the Head of <HI>Ca&s;ref</HI> Pa&s;ha, the <HI>Spa|heeler Aga&s;i;</HI> or General of the Spahees, which being executed by <HI>Morte&s;a</HI> the Commander in Chief in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> his Head was brought and thrown at the Gates of the Divan.</P>
<P>The Spahees a&s;toni&s;hed at this Spectacle, and enraged to &s;ee that Head on the Ground which they &s;o much e&s;teemed and loved, forgot all the Terms of Duty and Obedience to their Superiors; and without regard to the Place wherein they were, even within the Walls of the Grand Sig|nior's Court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mutiny of the Spahees joined with the Jani&s;a|ries.</NOTE> they threw Stones at the Vizier, and beat him from his Hor&s;e; which though the Grand Signior, and all the Viziers highly re&s;en|ted, as the mo&s;t &s;candalous Indignity that could be offered to the Maje&s;ty of a Supreme Ruler, and to all Government, yet their Coun&s;els ra|ther &s;ought Remedies to &s;uppre&s;s the Mutiny, than to make Propo&s;als of executing Ju&s;tice on the Offenders; for the Spahees &s;econded by the Jani&s;aries, (who were glad of any cau&s;e to make a Commotion) a&s;&s;embled in the <HI>Hippodromo,</HI> from whence they &s;ent an Arz to the Sultan, requiring the Heads of the Great Vizer, and of divers others, as well within as without the Seraglio. The Grand Signior denying po&s;itively to a&s;&s;ent hereunto, the Souldiery as plainly threatned to depo&s;e him, and place his Brother in the Throne; at which barbarous Re&s;olution the Grand Signior being affrighted, his youthful con&s;tancy was &s;o &s;haken, that he wrote to his Mother to de&s;ire her excu&s;e, in ca&s;e he a&s;&s;ented to the death of her Son-in-law the Great Vizier; for that the Storm of the Military Fury was &s;o great, that he could not endeavour to protect him without the lo&s;s of his Life and Crown: wherefore the Vizier being turned out of the Gates of the Seraglio, he was immediately butchered in the pre&s;ence of the Sultan.</P>
<P>Nor did the impetuous Rage of the Souldiery end here, but they proceeded farther to demand the Head of the Jani&s;ar-Aga, or General of the Jani&s;aries, who was reputed the chief In&s;trument of the Death of <HI>Ca&s;ref,</HI> becau&s;e he was a prin|cipal Favourite to the Grand Signior; but he wi&s;ely taking divers off with Mony and Pre&s;ents, &s;owed divi&s;ion between the Jani&s;aries and Spa|hees; &s;o that &s;ome Difficulty ari&s;ing hereupon, the determination of his Death was deferred for a while; how&s;oever they proceeded to demand, that the Mufti &s;hould be di&s;charged of his Office, and that the Tefterd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">, or Trea&s;urer, &s;hould be delivered into their hands.</P>
<P>To the fir&s;t the Grand Signior a&s;&s;ented; but being willing to &s;ave the other, he pretended, that he was e&s;caped and fled; but when he was found, he &s;hould run the &s;ame Fate with the Vi|zier. But the military Sedition not being ap|pea&s;ed with this An&s;wer, they roved through the whole City, and <HI>Galata,</HI> and other parts of the Suburbs: the Spahees per&s;i&s;ting to require the Head of the Jani&s;ar-Age, and not finding him in his Hou&s;e, they plundered it, and depar|ted; and meeting with a Youth, a Favourite of the Grand Signior's, they killed him; and &s;o re|turning with the like Fury to the Seraglio, they required admi&s;&s;ion to the New Vizier and Mufti. <HI>Regep</HI> Pa&s;ha, another of the Brothers-in-law, was then made Vizier, who with the new Mufit trembling at the&s;e Tumults, were careful to treat the Souldiery with all lenity and conde&s;cen|&s;ion imaginable, de&s;iring them to declare their Grievances, and what&s;oever might give them Satisfaction &s;hould be granted. The &s;editious Souldiers replied, That they were re&s;olved to &s;ee the Grand Signior's Brother, for that when the pre&s;ent Sultan did not govern well, they might know from whence to produce another of better Abilities, and more agreeable to the De|&s;igns of the Empire.</P>
<P>That nece&s;&s;ity which cau&s;ed the late ea&s;ine&s;s of conde&s;cen&s;ion to former demands, made way al&s;o for compliance with this; &s;o that the young Prince being brought forth, they obliged the Sul|tan not to attempt any thing again&s;t his Life, and cau&s;ed the Vizier and Mufti to become Cauti|on and Security for it.</P>
<P>Nor did the&s;e Conce&s;&s;ions contribute towards a Pacification; but rather their In&s;olence increa|&s;ed thereby, renewing their Exclamations at the Gates of the Seraglio for the Heads of the Jani|&s;ar-Aga and the Te&s;terdar; not would they be &s;atisfied with an&s;wer, that the&s;e Men were not found in the Seraglio, but &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in their rude Out-cryes and Menaces, lo&s;ing all re&s;pect and reverence to the Sultan and the Superiors; &s;o that the Grand Signior re&s;olved once to &s;ally out upon them with his own Guard; but trying their Temper and Re&s;olution, he di&s;covered mo&s;t of them to be poi&s;oned with the like Spirit of Sedition, and combining with the others as A&s;|&s;ociates in the Trea&s;on.</P>
<P>The Viziers, and other principal Officers, perceiving the Mutiny to increa&s;e daily, and not knowing to what degree it might ari&s;e, made it their bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;earch out for tho&s;e pro&s;cribed by the Souldiery: at length the Aga was happily di&s;covered by a certain Per&s;on, to whom a Re|ward was given of a thou&s;and Zechins, with the Office of Zorba&s;i or Captain; and the Aga con|fe&s;&s;ing that he had coun&s;elled the Death of <HI>Ca&s;|ref,</HI> he was immediately &s;trangled, and his Body hanged upon a Tree to publick view. The like Fate befel the Teftardar, who being al&s;o taken, was killed and hanged up together with the Body of the Aga.</P>
<P>All which Per&s;ons thus inhumanely murdered by the Souldiery, were the Enemies of the pre|&s;ent Great Vizier <HI>Regep;</HI> for which cau&s;e the Grand Signior &s;u&s;pecting that he &s;ecretly contri|ved and nouri&s;hed the&s;e Rebellions, never after looked on him with a gracious eye. Of which the Vizier being &s;en&s;ible, combined with the Souldiery; and judging it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to &s;et him&s;elf right in the Affection of his Ma&s;ter, he courted the Favour of the Militia, as the on|ly means to protect his Life, and maintain his Power. But as the revenge of Princes is not like a Thunder-bolt, which wounds on a &s;udden, but rather like a Mine which requires time to form, and is then &s;prang, when it may do the
<PB N="19" REF="12">be&s;t execution: &s;o in the &s;ame manner, the Grand Signior di&s;&s;embled his hate towards the Vizier,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Vizier &s;rangled by Order of the Grand Sig|nier.</NOTE> until one Night being pre&s;ent with him in the Seraglio to &s;ee certain Fire-works, he called him a&s;ide, and whi&s;pered to him, that he &s;hould go into his private Lodgings; where being entred, the Door was &s;hut upon him, and he &s;trangled by certain Eunuchs, who were appoin|ted to attend him for that purpo&s;e. But little benefit or riches did the Grand Signior. reap by his death; for the Vizier having for &s;ome time expected this Blow, had concealed his Trea&s;ure, and conveyed it away for the u&s;e of his Po&s;te|rity.</P>
<P>The like hatred did the Sultan conceive again&s;t the Souldiery, re&s;olving in his mind to execute his Revenge, e&s;pecially on the Jani&s;aries, as the mo&s;t turbulent Fomenters of Rebellion and Trea|&s;on, and to vent his Anger, either by the Cord or Sword, or &s;ome other more expedite way, as opportunity pre&s;ented: and to prevent or op|po&s;e the like Seditions for the future, he fortified the Seraglio, and brought Arms in thither by night, chu&s;ing into his Guard &s;elect Men of Cou|rage and Faithfulne&s;s: and being &s;en&s;ible, that the being of his Brother attempered his Sove|raignty, and drew away the Hearts and Eyes of his Souldiers and People from fixing entirely on his own Per&s;on; he therefore intended to cut him off; but the Caution and Security given by him|&s;elf, and chief Mini&s;ters, to pre&s;erve his Life, diverted him from this Re&s;olution.</P>
<P>In place of the decea&s;ed Vizier, <HI>Mehmet</HI> late Pa&s;ha of <HI>Cairo</HI> was con&s;tituted, and the Seal con&s;igned to him; with whom the Grand Signi|or con&s;ulting to him; which whom the Grand Signi|or con&s;ulting of the pre&s;ent Emergency of Af|fairs, often uttered his di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t the late Seditions, and &s;ignified his Intention to re|dre&s;s them for the future; in order unto which, he cau&s;ed the Heads of the mo&s;t mutinous Spa|hees to be cut off, and on various Pretences &s;epa|rated the Souldiery each from other into divers Parts; &s;ome numbers of Jani&s;aries he com|manded to march to the Confines of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and cau&s;ed many others of them to be killed by Night; and by various other Means greatly weakned the Chambers, both by dimini&s;hing the Numbers, and taking off &s;uch who were the Men of be&s;t Courage and Conduct: many Bodies were found &s;wimming in the <HI>Bo&s;phorus,</HI> and known to be Spahees; great part of the Lands the Pay of the Spahees was abated; and divers Offices of Profit and Honour were taken from the Militia, that &s;o Men might be made &s;en&s;ible of the Indignation of their Prince, and that there is no Sport or Je&s;ting with the Anger of a pro|voked King, who knows no other mean of his Pa&s;&s;ion, than the total evaporation of his Choler and Vengeance.</P>
<P>To maintain and make good the&s;e &s;everal Acts of Ju&s;t Puni&s;hment, young <HI>Morat</HI> growing in Courage with his Years, mounted on Hor&s;e-back, well Armed, and like a Souldier, attended with a &s;elect Party of Cavalry, pa&s;&s;ed through the mo&s;t publick Streets of the City in a huffing man|ner, and ca&s;ting a &s;tern Eye upon the Souldiery and People as he went, and making a hundred Pa&s;&s;es through the mid&s;t of them, &s;truck them with an awe of his Maje&s;ty, and admiration of his Warlike and Martial appearance; with which Severity and Gallantry the Souldiery being af|frighted, began to con&s;ider, that they were not longer to be governed by a Woman, or a Child, but by the mo&s;t brave Prince that ever &s;wayed the Ottoman Scepter; and thereupon for the fu|ture re&s;olved upon an impartial Submi&s;&s;ion and Obedience unto him. To encourage them in which, and to reconcile their Spirits and Affecti|ons to him, <HI>Morat</HI> oftentimes a&s;&s;embled his Soul|diery at <HI>Ackmeidan,</HI> where he exerci&s;ed with them, &s;hooting with the Bow at Marks and at Rovers, rewarding tho&s;e who &s;hot be&s;t, with ad|ding an A&s;per a day to their Pay; be&s;ides which, he di&s;tributed &s;ix thou&s;and Hungars among&s;t them, to demon&s;trate that wi&s;e Princes are u&s;ed to mix Lenitives with their Rigour.</P>
<P>The&s;e Mutinies and Seditions in the Captial City, encouraged Rebellious Spirits in divers o|ther places: &s;o that a certain Bold and Audacious Fellow, drawing a number of Mi&s;creants after him, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of the City of <HI>Pru&s;a:</HI> a|nother of the &s;ame Temper, called <HI>Elia</HI> Pa&s;ha, made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of <HI>Magne&s;ia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rebellion in <HI>Anatolla.</HI></NOTE> where he committed all the Outrages which Enemies inflict on a Conquered People; and being about twenty four miles di&s;tant from <HI>Smyrna,</HI> &s;o afrighted the People of that Place, who were Merchants, and &s;uch as lived by Trade, that they fled with their Wealth, and &s;uch Things as were portable, le&s;t they &s;hould be expo&s;ed to the Robbery and Spoil of Thieves and Rebels. But the Beglerbey of <HI>Anatolia</HI> &s;uffered not <HI>Elia</HI> to reign long in his lu&s;t, but giving him Battel in tho&s;e Plains, whol|ly defeated him, and &s;ent twenty of the Heads of the chief Commanders to the Sultan for a Pre&s;ent; and pur&s;uing <HI>Elia</HI> and the re&s;t of his Army to <HI>Magne&s;ia,</HI> be&s;ieged him in that City. The Grand Signior being advi&s;ed hereof, and fearing le&s;t the Siege &s;hould take up too much time, and move other ill Humors in that Coun|try, di&s;patched Orders to offer Terms and Con|ditions of Accommodation with <HI>Elia,</HI> which were &s;ecretly treated, and great Promi&s;es made him of Favour and Rewards from the Grand Signior. The ea&s;ie Fool accepted the Conditions, and embraced the Promi&s;es; and leaving his City of <HI>Magne&s;ia,</HI> proceeded confidently to <HI>Con|&s;tantinople</HI> to receive the gracious Rewards of the Sultan for his pa&s;t Services. At his Entry into the Seraglio in place of the <HI>Kapi&s;lar-Kahya&s;ee,</HI> or Ma&s;ter of the Ceremonies, he was received by Officers with a Cord in their Hands, who be|&s;towed on him the gracious Reward of his Ma|&s;ters ultimate Favour.</P>
<P>The&s;e Rebellions were no &s;ooner &s;uppre&s;&s;ed in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> but that other Mutinies of the Jani&s;aries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mutinies at <HI>Buda.</HI></NOTE> for want of Pay, began at <HI>Buda</HI> in <HI>Hungary,</HI> where they threw Stones at their Age, and pur|&s;ued him to the very Palace of the Pa&s;ha, elect|ing another into his place.

<P>To remedy the&s;e Di&s;orders, and extingui&s;h the Mutiny, the Grand Signior &s;ent Commi&s;&s;io|ners to examine the Matter, and to render him an account of the Grieveances and Demands of the Souldiers: but they fearing to be &s;urpri&s;ed with &s;ome &s;evere Acts of Ju&s;tice, prevented or fore&s;talled the Inquiries of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, by acknowledging their Fault, and demanding Par|don, with &s;urrender of four of the Ring-leaders to Puni&s;hment; declaring, That by their &s;e|ducement and evil per&s;wa&s;ions, they were de|bauched into that di&s;orderly cour&s;e of Proceed|ings: the Sultan accepted the Sumi&s;&s;ion, and all things were quieted in <HI>Hungary.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Amurat</HI> had now born to him a &s;eventh Daugh|ter, by his Slave called the <HI>Shining Star;</HI> and though he was much troubled that &s;he had not brought him forth a Son and Heir, yet &s;o much was &s;he beloved by him, that he re&s;olved to cre|ate her Queen, had not his Mother declared a|gain&s;t it, as a thing not u&s;ual for any Woman to be honoured with that Title before &s;he had &s;up|plied the Inheritance by the Birth of a Male Child.</P>
<P>And that he might now totally extingui&s;h the Fire of Sedition among&s;t the Souldiery, he cau|&s;ed <HI>Ferdum Efendi</HI> and <HI>Saluc</HI> Age, two prime Chiefs of the Spahees, with eight principal Jani|&s;aries, to be put to Death; after which &s;everity, fearing another In&s;urrection, he pa&s;&s;ed the Wa|ter, and retired to his Seraglio at <HI>Scutari,</HI> where he fortified him&s;elf.</P>
<P>It happened about that time, that a Turki&s;h Wo|man, a Slave, was found aboard a French Ship, ready to &s;ail from <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> which the Turks highly re&s;ented, and aggravated the Crime &s;o much again&s;t the French Amba&s;&s;adour, that they impri&s;oned his Son then embarqued, and would have confi&s;cated the Ve&s;&s;el and her Lading. In tho&s;e days the Chri&s;tian Amba&s;&s;adors re&s;ident at that Court, kept better Union and Corre&s;pon|dence among them&s;elves than they do at pre&s;ent; &s;o that all of them, as concerned, joined toge|ther to repre&s;ent before the chief Mini&s;ters, that &s;uch a Fault merited not &s;o grand a Forfei|ture, for that it was mo&s;t probable to have been committed without the privacy either of the Amba&s;&s;ador, or Commander of the Ship. The Am|ba&s;&s;adors then re&s;ident were Sir <HI>Peter Wych</HI> for <HI>England,</HI> the Sieur <HI>Marcheville</HI> for <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Pietro Fo&s;carini</HI> for <HI>Venice;</HI> at who&s;e warm and urgent In&s;tances the Turks conde&s;cended to re|lea&s;e the Ve&s;&s;el, and the Goods laden upon her, with free liberty to depart. How&s;oever it be|ing repre&s;ented to the Grand Signior by the Cap|tain-Pa&s;ha (who is Admiral of the Seas) that one <HI>Balda&s;ar,</HI> an Armenian by Nation, but Dra|goman or Interpreter to the French Amba&s;&s;a|dor, was a principal In&s;trument to move the Amba&s;&s;adors to unite in this Pretence; and be|ing ob&s;erved to manage the Intere&s;t of his Ma|&s;ter with warm and earne&s;t Sollicitations, the &s;urly Sultan grew &s;o angry, that one of his own Slaves &s;hould pre&s;ume to manage a Di&s;pute with him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The French Interpreter impaled.</NOTE> in Fury and Rage, commanded that he &s;hould be immediately empaled; and that he might be a&s;&s;ured that his Sentence took effect, he would &s;ee him with his own Eyes on the Stake before he would pa&s;s the Water to his Seraglio at <HI>Scutari.</HI> The re&s;olution was &s;o &s;udden, and the Execution &s;o &s;peedy, that there was neither Ear lent to hear, nor Time given to mediate in his behalf; and the Act being performed, com|plaints would not &s;erve to redre&s;s a tyrannous Action now pa&s;t Remedy, and not to be recalled: Wherefore as the Amba&s;&s;adors were forced to acquie&s;ce, and patiently endure the Affront; &s;o if they would have re&s;ented it, they could &s;carce have found one among&s;t their Interpreters of &s;o bold a Spirit, who dur&s;t have opened his Mouth after &s;o terrifying an Example. The truth is, the Dragomen, or Interpreters to Amba&s;&s;adors at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> are required to be Men of Learning, Courage, and Court&s;hip; their &s;tudies ought to endue them perfectly with the Turki&s;h, Greek, and Arabick Languages, with &s;ome know|ledg al&s;o of the Per&s;ian, and with good Elocu|tion, and readine&s;s of Tongue: their con&s;tancy and pre&s;ence of Mind is always nece&s;&s;ary at their appearance before tho&s;e Grandees or Great Men, who are ever proud, haughty, and arrogant in all their Expre&s;&s;ions and ways of Treaty, the which they commonly manage towards Chri&s;tian Mini&s;ters with the &s;ame re&s;pect which we u&s;e to|wards our Servants, or our Slaves. And there|fore by rea&s;on of this and other Pre&s;idents of like nature, Dragomen have been always timo|rous in repre&s;enting the true &s;ence of the Amba&s;|&s;adors and Con&s;uls; at lea&s;t have &s;o minced and tempered their words, that they have lo&s;t much of that Vigour and Accent which is nece&s;&s;ary to inculcate perfectly a Bu&s;ine&s;s into the Under&s;tan|ding of a Turk, e&s;pecially if you intend to in|cline him to Rea&s;on and Ju&s;tice. Wherefore it would be an excellent Qualification for an Am|ba&s;&s;adour him&s;elf to under&s;tand and &s;peak the Turki&s;h Language, or at lea&s;t to have a young Man by his &s;ide of the Engli&s;h Nation, educated in the Turki&s;h Court, who &s;hould be ready to ex|plicate tho&s;e Matters which are too thorny and prickly for Subjects of that Country to han|dle.</P>
<P>Had all the foregoing Troubles, Mutinies, and Misfortunes encountred the Spirit of an ea&s;ie and a gentle Sultan, certainly the Fate of this <HI>Amu|rat</HI> had been the &s;ame with that of <HI>O&s;man,</HI> who retiring within his Seraglio, could never have appea&s;ed the Seditious Humor with all the Con|ce&s;&s;ions he could give an unrea&s;onable multitude: but being a re&s;olved and bu&s;ling Prince, he at fir&s;t gave &s;ome few &s;teps backwards, as if he would yield &s;omewhat to the impetuo&s;ity of that Torrent which he could not re&s;i&s;t; yet it was only like a Ram, who retires, that he may butt with the greater force. How&s;oever the Politici|ans and &s;ober Men attributed the true cau&s;e of all the&s;e Commotions in the Souldiery, to have no other Foundation than the ill &s;ucce&s;s and mi&s;eries which attended the War in <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> for the way being long, and the Countries hot, barren, and for the mo&s;t part void of all comfort, the Soul|diers abhorred the Fatigues and March thither; and hated to con&s;ider, that they &s;hould be made a Sacrifice to the lu&s;t of voluptuous Mini&s;ters, who, to gain E&s;tates and Riches out of tho&s;e Monies which were de&s;igned to carry on the War, did not care, whil&s;t they lived at Ea&s;e and in Delights, what Labours, Wants, and Dangers attended the Militia.</P>
<P>The&s;e Con&s;iderations made likewi&s;e &s;ome im|pre&s;&s;ion in the Sultan, who therefore inclined to hearken unto tho&s;e Propo&s;itions of Peace which were brought him by an Amba&s;&s;ador from <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> and being accompanied with very great Pre&s;ents,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Peace made with <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and &s;peedily broken.</NOTE> the Peace was clapt up and concluded on a &s;ud|den. But as Things quick in their Birth and Production, are not long-liv'd, nor long durable; &s;o this Peace was broken the &s;ame Year with an incon&s;tancy equal to that incon&s;ideration with which it was agreed and &s;igned. For no &s;ooner was the News hereof flown into the Ea&s;tern World, than the Great <HI>Mogol</HI> di&s;patched his Amba&s;&s;ador with Letters to the Grand Signior, per&s;wading him to make War again with the Per&s;ian, promi&s;ing to a&s;&s;i&s;t him therein, by &s;top|ping up the Pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Nachivan,</HI> which is a City in the Le&s;&s;er <HI>Armenia,</HI> built upon the Ri|ver <HI>Aranes,</HI> and is the common Road into the

<P>An end being in this manner put to the Fight, the Turks gained the Victory, with the lo&s;s of twelve hundred Slaves killed and wounded, be|&s;ides Turks, and were forced into Port, where they remained a full Month to repair their Gal|lies; the which Fight affected all Turks with an a&s;toni&s;hment of the Engli&s;h Bravery, or Ob&s;ti|nacy, (as they call it) and is a Matter remem|bred and talked of to this Day, e&s;pecially by the Son of the Captain-Pa&s;ha who was &s;lain, called <HI>Omem,</HI> Pa&s;ha <HI>Ogli,</HI> who is Pa&s;ha of <HI>Rhodes</HI> at pre&s;ent, (as I remember) and commands three or four Gallies; for which rea&s;on he is &s;o inve|terate Enemy to the Engli&s;h, that to &s;atisfie his Revenge, he buys what Engli&s;h Slaves he can get into his Gallies, and &s;ells none out under a dou|ble Price or Ran&s;om.</P>
<P>The News of this Fight coming to <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople,</HI> provoked the Grand Signior to the height of Indignation; how&s;oever the Officers either being a&s;hamed of their Lo&s;s, or entertaining &s;ome &s;ecret admiration of the Engli&s;h Bravery, &s;uffered the Matter to be compounded for the Sum of forty thou&s;and Dollars, of which the Engli&s;h paid only their &s;hare with the French and Venetians, whom (for I know not what Rea|&s;on) the Turks equally concerned in the Occa|&s;ion.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the Turks were appointing a new Cap|tain-Pa&s;ha, and again refitting their Fleet, the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Dama&s;cus</HI> di&s;patched a Summons to <HI>Fa|cardin</HI> to &s;urrender <HI>Seida</HI> up to him, with other Ca&s;tles and Places of Strength. The Old Man re&s;ided then a <HI>Barut,</HI> where pretending to be retired from all Bu&s;ine&s;s, an&s;wered, that he had re&s;igned the whole Government into the Hands of his Son <HI>Ali,</HI> as he had already te&s;tified by Publick Acts: that he was but a Subject, and a Souldier under his Son, and therefore to him they ought to make their Applications. <HI>Facar|din</HI> had at that time an Army of twenty five thou&s;and Men, the which he divided into two Bodies, commanded by his two Sons. <HI>Ali</HI> his elde&s;t he ordered with twelve thou&s;and Men (a thou&s;and of which were Maronites, and two thou&s;and Druzes) to march to <HI>Saphet</HI> for hinde|ring the conjunction of the Emirs of <HI>Feruc</HI> and <HI>Therabith,</HI> and the Pa&s;ha's of <HI>Gaza</HI> and <HI>Dama&s;|cus,</HI> who&s;e Forces being joined together, did not compo&s;e a greater Number than that of <HI>Facar|din.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ali</HI> entercountring with them, and being a brisk and hot-metled Prince, engaged and charg|ed them &s;o whom, that he defeated them, and killed eight thou&s;and of their Men; but &s;uch a Victory as this not co&s;ting him le&s;s than &s;even thou&s;and of his Men, was in effect his own Overthrow; for being the next day charged a|gain by the Enemy, both &s;ides fought with that ob&s;tinacy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Son of <HI>Facardin</HI> overthrown</NOTE> that (as is reproted) there remained not above an hundred forty &s;ix of all the Soul|diers which followed <HI>Ali;</HI> and he him&s;elf ha|ving his Hor&s;e mortally wounded under him, and being out of Breath, Weary, and Faint, yield|ed him&s;elf to a common Souldier, who promi&s;ed him Quarter; but afterwards having him in his power, he &s;trangled him with his Match, and cut off his Head and his little Finger on which he wore his Seal-Ring,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And is &s;trangled.</NOTE> and &s;o pre&s;ented both to the Pa&s;ha. But this proud Conquerour refu&s;ed to accept this Pre&s;ent without Ceremony, until fir&s;t the head had been perfumed with Sweet Waters, the Beard combed out, and covered with a rich Turbant, and having kept this Tro|phy for &s;ome days by him, he &s;ent it afterwards to <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI></P>
<P>But before the News of this Defeat reached the Ears of old <HI>Facardin,</HI> the Captain-Pa&s;ha with his Fleet of Gallies arrived at the Port of <HI>Tripoli;</HI> to whom <HI>Facardin</HI> being de&s;irous to &s;hew all Friend&s;hip, and profe&s;s Loyalty to the Grand Signior, he cau&s;ed his Army to retire into the Parts of Mount <HI>Libanus,</HI> whil&s;t he him&s;elf, with about three thou&s;and Men, between Dome&s;tick Servants and his Guards, went to <HI>Seida,</HI> from whence he &s;ent two<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">A &s;ort of Ve&s;&s;el or Ship &s;o cal|led by the Turks.</NOTE> <HI>Caramo&s;auis</HI> laden with Provi&s;ions and Refre&s;hment to the Captain-Pa&s;ha for a Pre&s;ent, a&s;&s;uring him, that he was an hum|ble Va&s;&s;al to the Grand Signior, and was ready to obey all his Commands; and becau&s;e the Sultan may probably have received &s;ini&s;ter Reports rela|ting to the Arms he had taken up, he a&s;&s;ured him, that they were no otherwi&s;e de&s;igned, than to &s;uppre&s;s the Robberies of the Arabs, and the Incur&s;ions of their Kings; and that he was rea|dy to conduct his Army to any Place, where his Ma&s;ter the Grand Signior &s;hould think fit to em|ploy them. But the&s;e fair words could not di|vert the Captain-Pa&s;ha from his Re&s;olution to enter the Port of <HI>Seida,</HI> nor from his In&s;tructions of demanding, and upon refu&s;al of forcing po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Ca&s;tle; which as it was the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Fortre&s;s, and the mo&s;t plea&s;ant Seat of all his Dominions, &s;o he could not, without much regret and &s;orrow, hearken to &s;uch a Pro|po&s;ition: wherefore that the Pa&s;ha might not per&s;i&s;t in this Demand, he &s;ecretly proffered him an hundred thou&s;and Zechins as a Bribe to him|&s;elf, and his Son <HI>Man&s;our</HI> to be carried for a Ho|&s;tage and Earne&s;t of his Faithfulne&s;s to the Grand Signior. The Captain-Pa&s;ha liked well the hun|dred thou&s;and Zechins and the Ho&s;tages, but &s;till required the Surrender of the Ca&s;tle with them; on which whil&s;t <HI>Facardin</HI> deliberated, News came of the Death of his Son <HI>Ali,</HI> and the De|&s;truction of his Army, with which, lo&s;ing all Cou|rage, he yielded his Ca&s;tle of <HI>Seida</HI> to the Cap|tain-Pa&s;ha, retiring him&s;elf to his City of <HI>Ba|rut:</HI> nor could he re&s;t quietly at that Place; for being pur&s;ued, he was forced to quit it, and re|tire with his Maronites and Druzes into the Mountains, le&s;t being inclo&s;ed within the Walls of a City, he &s;hould fall alive into the Hands of his Enemies.</P>
<P>And now all good Fortune for&s;aking unhappy <HI>Facardin,</HI> the Maronites and Druzes his Subjects revolt to the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> his Palaces of Gardens of Plea&s;ure were all ruined, his Friends for&s;ook him, his two remaining Sons were lo&s;t, one carried to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> for a Ho&s;tage, and the other &s;lain in Fight; his Towns of <HI>Gazir, Saphet,</HI> St. <HI>John d' Acria,</HI> and others were &s;ur|rendred to the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Dama&s;cus:</HI> only &s;ome few &s;trong Places in the Mountains remained to him, where living in League with <HI>Reba</HI> a King of the Arabs, he committed all the Spoils he was able on the Lands belonging to the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Da|ma&s;cus.</HI> But being hunted from one Mountain to another, and from one Cave to another, he was at length forced to &s;urrender upon Conditi|ons, that he &s;hould have liberty to proceed unto
<PB N="23" REF="14">the Grand Signior with his own Equipage of three hundred Men, and Trumpets &s;ounding, and that he might carry with him all his Trea|&s;ure con&s;i&s;ting of a Million of Zechins all in Gold, together with other Riches, which were carried by fourteen Camels; and that he &s;hould not be conducted as a Pri&s;oner in Triumph, but that he &s;hould with freedom approach the Pre|&s;ence of the Sultan, like other Pa&s;ha's, who are in Grace and Favour.</P>
<P>The&s;e Propo&s;als being granted, <HI>Facardin</HI> with his two young Sons began his Journey to <HI>Con|&s;tantinople,</HI> and being about two days journey from thence, he di&s;patched eight Che&s;ts of Gold before him, to prepare and make his way to the Grand Signior; who being plea&s;ed with the Gold, and greatly rejoyced to receive the Submi&s;&s;ion and Homage of one who had &s;o long &s;tood out in Rebellion, he went out in a Di&s;gui&s;e and Habit of a Pa&s;ha to &s;ee and di&s;cour&s;e with that Per&s;on, of whom there had been &s;o general a Rumor: and having accordingly encountred with the E|mir, he &s;ate down in his Tent with him, de|&s;iring him to relate the Story of his Life, with the &s;everal Particulars of his late Misfortunes. Emir <HI>Facardin</HI> well knew the Per&s;on of the Grand Signior; but feigning as if he was unac|quainted with whom he di&s;cour&s;ed, and that he took him for &s;ome Pa&s;ha, began to recount the Cour&s;e of his Life, the Rea&s;ons why his Ene|mies fal&s;ely &s;ugge&s;ted evil Reports of him to the Grand Signior; how he was forced, for defence of his Life, to take up Arms, and what ill Suc|ce&s;s accompanied his Affairs; all which he repre|&s;ented with &s;uch Quickne&s;s and Eloquence, that the Grand Signior pitying his Misfortunes, pro|mi&s;ed to be his Advocate, and mediate with the Grand Signior in his behalf.</P>
<P>The day following <HI>Facardin</HI> made his Entry in a Triumphant manner, and received a mo&s;t favourable Audience from the Grand Signior; and all the Pa&s;ha's and great Men in conformity to their Ma&s;ter, and in hopes of &s;haring &s;ome part of his Gold, &s;hewed him a like kind favou|rable Countenance and A&s;pect.</P>
<P>But finding afterwards that <HI>Facardin</HI> increa&s;ed daily in the e&s;teem of the Grand Signior, and that the old Rebel was become a new Favourite, and that he was likely to over-top and out them, they generally con&s;pired together, taking the Mufti on their &s;ide, to accu&s;e him of many Crimes, and more particularly that he was a Chri&s;tian, and an Apo&s;tate from the Mahome|tan Faith. This Point of Religion &s;o &s;en&s;ibly touched the Grand Signior, that he re&s;olved to condemn him in a manner Solemn and Extraor|dinary; for mounting one Day on his Throne, he commanded <HI>Facardin</HI> to be brought in, and placed on a low Chair; where ordering his Crimes whereof he was accu&s;ed to be recited, he pa&s;&s;ed a formal Sentence of Death upon him: but <HI>Facardin</HI> ari&s;ing to ju&s;tifie him&s;elf, was not permitted to &s;peak, only he obtained a quarter of an hours reprieve to make his Prayers, and af|terwards was &s;trangled by the hands of two Mutes.</P>
<P><HI>Morat</HI> growing now into Years, took into his own Hands the Reins of Government, re|&s;olving to rule Singly and Ab&s;olutely, and to make him&s;elf rather Feared than Beloved: He degraded four Viziers at once, and bani&s;hed them into <HI>Cyprus,</HI> confi&s;cating their E&s;tates, for no other Rea&s;on, than becau&s;e they had denied him the u&s;e of their Mules and Camels on occa|&s;ion of his Service.</P>
<P>He became extremely &s;evere again&s;t the Soul|diery, cru&s;hing them with all imaginable Ri|gour on the lea&s;t appearance of Reluctancy to his Commands; declaring,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Morat</HI> ex|erci&s;es &s;eve|ral Acts of Tyranny.</NOTE> That he expected Blind and Silent Obedience from all, but e&s;peci|ally from his Souldiery.</P>
<P>He impo&s;ed a great Tax upon Copper; and becau&s;e he had &s;everal Warthou&s;es filled with that Mettal, which had for many Years lain by, he forced the People to buy it at his own Rates. At which Aggrievance the Commonalty grow|ing de&s;perate, began to Mutiny and Rebel; but <HI>Morat</HI> put a &s;peedy &s;top thereunto, by cutting off the Heads of fifty of the mo&s;t Seditious, and &s;o pa&s;&s;ed to <HI>Pru&s;a,</HI> with the Attendance of &s;ix Gallies.</P>
<P>He cau&s;ed a Kadi to be hanged, to the great Di&s;plea&s;ure and univer&s;al Re&s;entment of the Ulemah, who are Students in the Law; who to make known their Aggrievance, and Con&s;ult a a Remedy, a&s;&s;embled in great Numbers at the Hou&s;e of the Mufti.</P>
<P>The Queen-Mother being acquainted with this Meeting, and fearing the ill Con&s;equences thereof, gave immediate Advice to the Sultan; who with like Expedition di&s;patched a Boat to bring over the Mufti and his Son to <HI>Pru&s;a;</HI> who were no &s;ooner arrived, than they were &s;trang|led, not being permitted to &s;peak for them|&s;elves, or to alledge any Plea or Excu&s;e for their Lives. This Act of Cruelty, beyond the Example of former Ages, and never practi&s;ed by the mo&s;t tyrannical of his Predece&s;&s;ors, &s;truck a Terror on the whole Empire; for Men ob|&s;erving the unju&s;t Rigour which was executed on the Head and Chief of their Law, the Ora|cle and Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">th which re&s;olved their difficult Problems, and whom the World &s;o reverenced and honoured, that few Examples have been of Capital Puni&s;hment executed on his reverend Head, feared, that Innocence was not &s;ufficient to &s;ecure their own le&s;s con&s;iderable E&s;tates from his Fury and Violence.</P>
<P>There is a particular Death allotted for Muf|ties which is, by braying them in a Mortar, which is kept in the &s;even Towers at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and there &s;hewed to Strangers; which In&s;trument hath been &s;eldom made u&s;e of.</P>
<P><HI>Morat</HI> being greatly addicted to Wine,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Morat</HI> de|&s;troys the Taverns.</NOTE> was &s;en&s;ible of the ill Effects of it in him&s;elf, and that the heat of debauchery inclined him to Vio|lence and Cruelty, and from hence collecting how dangerous this Humour of Drunkenne&s;s was in his People, e&s;pecially in his Souldiery, for that much of the late Seditions might be attribu|ted thereunto, he publi&s;hed a mo&s;t &s;evere Edict again&s;t Wine, commanding all Taverns to be demoli&s;hed, the Butts to be broken, and the Wine &s;pilt. It was the common Cu&s;tom of the Grand Signior to walk the Streets in di&s;gui&s;e; when meeting with any drunken Per&s;on, he would impri&s;on him, and almo&s;t drub him to Death. It was his fortune to meet a Deaf Man one day in the Streets; who not hearing the Noi&s;e of the People, nor the Rumor of his Ap|proach, did not &s;o readily &s;hift out of the way, as was con&s;i&s;tent with the fear and dread of &s;o aw|ful an Emperor, for which default he was &s;trang|led immediately, and his Body thrown into the Streets.</P>
<P>All People feared and trembled at the&s;e Pra|ctices, and were as careful to look out abroad for the Grand Signior, le&s;t they &s;hould be &s;urpri&s;ed with the blu&s;ter of his pre&s;ence, as Mariners are of being taken unprovided by &s;ome &s;udden Gu&s;t or Hurricane; for there was &s;carce a Day, that one Innocent or other was not &s;acrificed to his Fury and tyrannical Fancy.</P>

<P>One <HI>Thomas Zanetti,</HI> a Venetian Merchant, who had built a lofty Jardac, or a high Room of Pro&s;pective on the top of his Hou&s;e, was accu&s;ed to the Grand Signior to have de&s;igned that Place for no other end, than that he might with a long Gla&s;s over&s;ee the Chambers of the Ladies, and the Gardens,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hangs a Venetian Merchant.</NOTE> and Walks of the Seraglio: For which Rea&s;on, without farther inquiry, he was hanged in his Shirt on the top of his Jar|dac, with a red Streamer in his Hand, that &s;o the Grand Signior might be &s;ure that the Sen|tence was executed. The E&s;tate of <HI>Zanetti,</HI> whe|ther belonging to him&s;elf or Principals, was con|fi&s;cated; but in regard the Goods, for &s;ecurity, were privately conveyed to the Ware-hou&s;es of &s;everal Frank Merchants, &s;trict &s;earch was made for them; but in regard the Marks and Num|bers were altered, they could not be di&s;tingui&s;h|ed: wherefore the Graud Signior concluding, that all the Frank Merchants had combined to|gether to deceive him, he Impri&s;oned every Man of them; nor would he relea&s;e them, until they had paid forty thou&s;and Dollars for their Ran|&s;om and Liberty.</P>
<P>After which, upon pretence of a Plot, or A|greement of the Franks to defend them&s;elves from the leviation of this Tax, the Turks &s;earched their Hou&s;es for Arms; in taking of which they were &s;o rigorous, that they &s;pared not &s;o much as a Birding-piece; nor yet the Sword of Sir <HI>Peter Wych,</HI> then Amba&s;&s;ador for <HI>England,</HI> though he alledged, that it was the ve|ry Sword with which his Maje&s;ty and conferred the Honour of Knighthood upon him.</P>
<P>But from the&s;e Tran&s;actions at Home, let us pa&s;s to the Wars in <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> That In|vincible Princes, <HI>&V;ladi&s;laus</HI> King of <HI>Poland,</HI> had gained &s;uch good Succe&s;s again&s;t the Czar of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> that the Czar was forced to demand A&s;&s;i&s;tance from the Turks. The Grand Signior, though he had lately made a Peace with <HI>Poland,</HI> and &s;worn to maintain the Articles of <HI>Chocin,</HI> concluded by his Predece&s;&s;or Sultan <HI>O&s;man;</HI> yet the continual Depredations which the Co&s;&s;acks made, did always admini&s;ter rea&s;onable Preten|ces for a War: To which <HI>Aba&s;&s;a,</HI> one of his chief Coun&s;ellors, a valiant and pre&s;umptuous Captain, did much incite him; for promi&s;ing to him&s;elf the Conduct of that Army de&s;igned a|gain&s;t <HI>Poland,</HI> did much flatter the Sultan and him&s;elf with the Fancy of mighty Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>The War being thus re&s;olved upon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Turks make War on the Poles.</NOTE> the Turk, who commonly &s;trikes before he Quarrels, gave Orders to <HI>Aba&s;&s;a</HI> to make Levies of Men in <HI>Mol|davia</HI> and <HI>Valachia;</HI> and to put the Tartars in Arms, and the Militia of <HI>Buda,</HI> and of the Parts along the <HI>Danube</HI> into a warlike Po&s;ture, and with all Expedition to enter <HI>Poland.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Aba&s;&s;a</HI> who had with wonderful diligence put his Troops in readine&s;s, ordered the Tartars, with a Body of fifteen thou&s;and Men to enter <HI>Po|land;</HI> which they performed with &s;uch celerity, that pa&s;&s;ing the River of <HI>Tyre</HI> above <HI>Chocin</HI> and <HI>Rinczug,</HI> they in a few hours laid wa&s;te for the &s;pace of ten Leagues round <HI>Kemenitz,</HI> and &s;o retired with their Booty into <HI>Moldavia:</HI> how|&s;oever their ha&s;te was not attended with &s;uch good &s;peed, but that they were overtaken on the <HI>4th</HI> of <HI>July</HI> by <HI>Stani&s;laus Koni&s;polzki,</HI> General of the Poli&s;h Army, with no greater Force than two thou&s;and five hundred Hor&s;e; how&s;oever &s;urpri&s;ing them whil&s;t they were feeding their Hor&s;es, he put them into &s;uch Confu&s;ion and Di&s;order, that he ea&s;ily recovered all their Boo|ty, and took five of their chief Men Pri&s;oners; of which the Son-in-Law of the <HI>Cantemir</HI> was one.

<P><HI>Koni&s;polzki</HI> the Poli&s;h General, having not &s;uf|ficient Force to oppo&s;e them in open Field, nor time to a&s;&s;emble a greater Army, gathered what Supplies he could from the Co&s;&s;acks and Lords of that Country, and therewith encamped him|&s;elf upon a Hill between the River <HI>Tyr</HI> and the Town of <HI>Chocin,</HI> that he might be the better able to &s;uccour <HI>Kemenitz,</HI> which the Enemy de|&s;igned to a&s;&s;ault.</P>

<P>To which he an&s;wered; <HI>That he was come to bring his Maje&s;ty Advice of the Coronation of his King; and to e&s;tabli&s;h a Peace, is his Maje&s;ty &s;hould judg fit to accept thereof.</HI></P>
<P>To which the Sultan replied; <HI>That all Chri|&s;tian Kings ought either to receive the Ottoman Laws, or pay him Tribute, or try the &s;harpne&s;s of his Sword.</HI> And taking a Cemiter in his hand which hung by him, he drew it half out, and &s;aid; <HI>With this I will &s;ubdue my Enemies; and though take another in</HI> Poland.</P>
<P>To which the Amba&s;&s;ador returning a mode&s;t An&s;wer, was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed of the Royal Pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>And now the Grand Signior, to put a good face on the Bu&s;ine&s;s, and to make the World be|lieve, that he de&s;igned what he &s;pake, he pro|claimed a War with <HI>Poland,</HI> and ordered his Tents to be carried abroad, &s;uppo&s;ing hereby to draw the Poles to his own Terms of Agreement. And in pur&s;uance hereof he mounted on Hor&s;e|back, and rode in &s;tate through the City, his upper Ve&s;t was made after the Hungarian Fa&s;hi|on lined with Sables; in his right hand he car|ried a Quiver of Arrows, in his left two drawn Swords, on his Turbant he wore a large Plume of Feathers, encompa&s;&s;ed with a Circle of Dia|monds; and in this manner entring his Tents, he proceeded to <HI>Adrianople.</HI> But before his de|parture, the Count <HI>Puchen,</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador from the Emperor, arrived with other &s;umptuous Pre|&s;ents, offering Incen&s;e and Gifts of Peace at the Throne of this Greatne&s;s.</P>
<P>But before we relate the Tran&s;actions at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> and the Succe&s;s of Affairs at that Place, let us recount &s;everal di&s;mal Accidents at <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI></P>
<P>The Grand Signior returning by Sea from a place called <HI>Stravo&s;ta</HI> in the Bay of <HI>I&s;mit,</HI> an|ciently the Bay of <HI>Nicomedia,</HI> where he had for &s;ome time held his Court and great Divan, he was followed by &s;everal Ve&s;&s;els appointed to tran&s;port the People;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;everal Mi&s;chiefs by Water and Fire.</NOTE> in one whereof were nine|ty five Per&s;ons embarked, all of them Pa&s;ha's, Aga's, and chief Officers of the Court; the Ve&s;&s;el was over-&s;et by a &s;udden gu&s;t of Wind, and all the People drowned excepting three Sea-men which &s;aved them&s;elves by &s;wimming. More con&s;iderable were the Mi&s;chiefs by Fire; For on occa&s;ion of &s;ome Fire-works made in one of the Grand Siguior's Chiosks, or Hou&s;es of Plea&s;ure, the Fire took &s;o fiercely on the Tavan,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A terrible Fire at <HI>Con&s;tan|tinople.</HI></NOTE> or wooden Works of the Sieling, that it endan|gered the whole Palace, and had con&s;umed all, but that many Hands and active Men gave a &s;top to the farther Progre&s;s.</P>
<P>This Fire was but a fore-ruuner of a greater, which began the <HI>16th</HI> of <HI>September</HI> in that part of the City of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> which is called <HI>Aia|cab,</HI> being between the Wall and the Port, where live Taverners, Butchers, Fi&s;hmongers, and others who &s;ell Provi&s;ions. The Fire took fir&s;t in one of tho&s;e Hou&s;es which had been a Ta|vern, and are Buildings only made of Deal|boards and Timber; which combu&s;tible Matter the Hou&s;es round, and was &s;o quick in its Mo|tion, as if it had taken by a Train, or that &s;ome wicked People with Fire-balls had em|ployed them&s;elves in the Mi&s;chief; the Fire took its Cour&s;e again&s;t the Wind, burning on one &s;ide and the other to the Hi&s;torical Pillar, and to the Mo&s;chs of Sultan <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and Sultan <HI>Selim;</HI> &s;o that in a &s;hort time one third of the City was reduced to A&s;hes.</P>
<P>It is difficult to expre&s;s the lamentable De|&s;truction was made hereby, what Riches, what Palaces, and Moveables were con&s;umed in it, there being twenty thou&s;and Hou&s;es reported to be burnt; which Mi&s;ery is be&s;t repre&s;ented by the remembrance of our calamitous Incendiation at <HI>London;</HI> the greate&s;t difference between one and the other was, that that at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> was more quick in its Motion; for it burnt a larger compa&s;s of Ground in one third of the Time, than ours did at <HI>London;</HI> for that City for the mo&s;t part con&s;i&s;ting of &s;light Buildings of Wood, met not the re&s;i&s;tance which ours &s;ome|times did again&s;t the Walls of Brick and Stones.</P>
<P>The Fire being extingui&s;hed, and Men having time to lament and think, bagan to impute the Cau&s;e and Fault to tho&s;e whom they mo&s;t &s;u|&s;pected; &s;ometimes they accu&s;ed the Per&s;ians for having fired the City, for which Crime one of them the next Year &s;uffered Death. Some at|tributed the Cau&s;e of all to the Jani&s;aries; and that they, out of hatred to the Inhabitants, or for the &s;ake of Plunder, if they did not begin, yet at lea&s;t increa&s;ed the Fire; which they the more &s;u&s;pected, becau&s;e the Jani&s;aries refu&s;ed not only to work them&s;elves, alledging, that they expected Orders from their Aga, but like|wi&s;e hindered and di&s;couraged others. How&s;o|ever the Grand Signior not wanting on his own part to contribute all A&s;&s;i&s;tance po&s;&s;ible, &s;ent four thou&s;and Men out of his Seraglio to work about the Fire, not excu&s;ing the very Officers of his Royal Chamber from contributing their Authori|ty and per&s;onal Aid; &s;ome of which ventured far into the Fire, to demon&s;trate their Courage, Activene&s;s, and Obedience to the Commands of their Emperor: but all this was too little again&s;t an ob&s;tinate and an invincible Enemy, for the Fire flamed, and proceeded, until it wanted Nouri&s;hment and Food to con&s;ume.</P>
<P>In fine, twenty thou&s;and Hou&s;es were burnt, two hundred Mo&s;chs, and the Library of the Mufti, which for the Number of the Arabick and Per&s;ian Books, was curious, and of high e&s;teem. The Albengs, or Habitation of the
<PB N="26" REF="16">Jani&s;aries containing three hundred Chambers, of which each Chamber was capable to receive four hundred Men, were all burnt and reduced to A&s;hes.</P>
<P>The which fatal and mi&s;erable Spectacle, did a little touch the Heart of Sultan <HI>Morat;</HI> &s;o that he gave out con&s;iderable Sums to comfort the Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, who had mo&s;t &s;uffered by this Cala|mity, and to rai&s;e from its A&s;hes his con&s;umed and langui&s;hing <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> which being re|vived and flouri&s;hing, was again mi&s;erably con|&s;umed by Flames, in the Month of <HI>April</HI> 1660. But &s;uch is the beneficial and commodious &s;itua|tion of that Place, and the Riches thereof by Trade, and the Pre&s;ence of the Ottoman Court, that the Inhabitants again rebuilt it in fewer Years than could be imagined.</P>
<P>But now to return to the Grand Signior at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> we find him re&s;olutely de&s;igned to make a War upon <HI>Poland,</HI> to whcih he was in|duced by the Per&s;wa&s;ions of <HI>Aba&s;&s;a,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rea&s;ons for a War with <HI>Poland.</HI></NOTE> and the pre&s;ent conjuncture of Advantage to join with the Mo&s;covite, it &s;eeming great Policy not to &s;uffer the Countries of <HI>Mo&s;covy</HI> to be over-run; or the Poles, who is a warlike and dangerous Nation, to grow Pui&s;&s;ant and Powerful by his Succe&s;s and Conque&s;t over his Neighbours: Wherefore Preparations were made on all &s;ides for the War; great Quantities of Provi&s;ions and Ammunition were &s;ent into <HI>Moldavia</HI> by way of the Black Sea and the <HI>Danube.</HI></P>
<P>The Tartar <HI>Han</HI> &s;ent word that all his Forces were in readine&s;s, and expected nothing but their Orders to march. The Beglerbey of <HI>Greece</HI> made his Rendezvous at <HI>Philippolis</HI> with an Army of thirty thou&s;and Men, where he attend|ed to join with the Forces of <HI>Bo&s;na, Sili&s;tria,</HI> and other parts of <HI>Europe. Moldavia</HI> and <HI>Walachia</HI> made an appearance of Levying Men, and join|ing with the Turk; but thier Hearts were to|wards the Poles, with whom they kept a &s;ceret corre&s;pondence, and would be ready to adhere on the lea&s;t on the lea&s;t Opportunity.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the Army of the Turks was &s;o great, and all his Affairs in that readine&s;s, that he &s;corned to incline an Ear to Propo&s;itions of Peace; in which Opinion <HI>Aba&s;&s;a</HI> humoured and per&s;waded him, that the Poles were &s;o fearful of his Forces, that they had already yielded to Terms of compounding for a yearly Tribute. All which proved fal&s;e; for in the mean time <HI>&V;ladi&s;laus</HI> King of <HI>Poland,</HI> remitting nothing of the Heat and Vigour of his War again&s;t the Mo&s;covites, he was &s;o &s;uccesful therein, that he foced an Army of eighty thou&s;and Men, which he had be&s;ieged in their Camp,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Victory which the Poles ob|tained over the Mo&s;co|vites.</NOTE> to lay down their Arms, and &s;urrender them&s;elves; which was an Action &s;carce to be credited, at lea&s;t to be parallel'd in any Hi&s;tory; and with this Con|que&s;t he might have proceeded to the Capital City of <HI>Mo&s;co,</HI> and concluded the War and that Empire: But God's Provdence, which governs all things, altered this Coun&s;el, and diverted tho&s;e victorious Arms to the Siege of <HI>Bial;</HI> which Town being well fortified and gari&s;oned, with|&s;tood many A&s;&s;aults of the Enemy, and blunted the Spirits and Swords of the Conqueror; for lo&s;ing much time in this Siege, other Towns made u&s;e of the Opportunity to provide and fortify them&s;elves; whil&s;t the Poles growing weary, and wanting Pay, rai&s;ed divers Mutinies and Seditions in the Camp. The&s;e Difficulties and Inconveniences inclined the King <HI>&V;ladi&s;laus</HI> to bend a favourable Ear to the many Supplications and In&s;tances which the Mo&s;covites made for Peace: So that the Plenipotentiaries being a&s;|&s;embled, it was agreed, that the Dutchy of <HI>Smole&s;co</HI> and <HI>Czernie&s;chou,</HI> which two hundred Years pa&s;t had been taken from <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Litua|nia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">They make a Peace.</NOTE> with many other Towns and Countries, to the extent of two hundred Leagues, &s;hould be re&s;tored to the Kingdom of <HI>Poland.</HI></P>
<P>The News of this &s;udden Peace coming unex|pectedly to Sultan <HI>Morat,</HI> cau&s;ed his Bravadoes again&s;t <HI>Poland</HI> to cea&s;e, and to turn the &s;tile of his Fury and Indignation again&s;t the Mo&s;covites, whom he vilified with all imaginable Terms of Per&s;idiou&s;ne&s;s and Cowardi&s;e, and abu&s;ed and impri&s;oned their Amba&s;&s;adors. He con&s;idered that he had provoked an Enemy who was Victo|rious, Valiant, and Powerful, and one who at any time was able to contend with his united Force, much more whil&s;t it was &s;eparated and di&s;joined by his War in <HI>Per&s;ia:</HI> wherefore in all ha&s;te he di&s;patched an Amba&s;&s;ador into <HI>Poland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Turk &s;ends an Amba&s;&s;ador into <HI>Poland</HI> to de&s;ire a Peace.</NOTE> called <HI>Shahin</HI> Aga, de&s;iring to renew the ancient League and Articles of Peace. This Amba&s;&s;a|dor found the King at the Diet in <HI>Wa&s;aw,</HI> where he publickly endeavoured to excu&s;e his Ma&s;ter for the late Acts of Ho&s;tility; a&s;&s;uring them, that they were not performed according to his Ma&s;ter's De&s;ires, and Original Intentions, but as they were moved and guided by the evil Sug|ge&s;tions and Artifices of <HI>Aba&s;&s;a,</HI> who being &s;ole|ly culpable of this Fault, by giving ill Coun&s;els to his Ma&s;ter, he a&s;&s;ured them, in the Name of the Sultan, that he &s;hould receive &s;uch Puni&s;h|ment as they &s;hould think fit to inflict upon him. Hereupon the King <HI>&V;ladi&s;laus</HI> gave this An&s;wer, That &s;ince the Grand Signior could &s;o ea&s;ily in|fringe the Articles of that Peace which had been &s;olemnly and &s;acredly e&s;tabli&s;hed, it was now his Part, and the Wi&s;dom of that grave A&s;&s;em|bly, to contrive &s;uch Conditions and Bonds wherewith to oblige his Ma&s;ter, as could not ea|&s;ily and at his Plea&s;ure be broken or avoided. And at the &s;ame time the Poli&s;h Amba&s;&s;ador be|ing returned from <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and di&s;cour&s;ing in the Diet of the Pride and Perfidiou&s;ne&s;s of the Turks, and the Scorn wherewith they recei|ved Chri&s;tian Amba&s;&s;adors, &s;o incen&s;ed the Spi|rit of the whole A&s;&s;embly, that with a genersl Con&s;ent they approved the words of the King, adding, That they would, no longer be &s;ubject to the In&s;ults and Fal&s;ities of that Tyrant, whom they would make to know, that they wore as well Offen&s;ive as Defen&s;ive Arms; and were not of that abject Spirit, or mean Condition, to permit the Sultan to violate the mo&s;t Sacred Articles of Peace, and then at his plea&s;ure to &s;alve them with a fawning Acknowledgment, or a flattering Speech. In this manner the Turki&s;h Amba&s;&s;ador was returned, whil&s;t the King <HI>&V;la|di&s;laus</HI> went into <HI>Podolia</HI> to take a view of his Armies; which he found to con&s;i&s;t of eighty thou&s;and fighting Men, all well accoutred, of good Courage, and ready to follow their King to the Walls of <HI>Con&s;taninople.</HI></P>
<P>The fear of the Motion of this great Army, in a Conjuncture when the Wars broken out a|gain in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> were not pro&s;perous, affected the Mind of <HI>Morat</HI> which much terror; &s;o that he became very &s;ollicitous to find out, and make &s;ome &s;ub&s;tantial Propo&s;ition in order to an Ac|commodation. One of the Viziers called <HI>Mor|teza,</HI> was very active in this Bu&s;ine&s;s, plying con|tinually the General <HI>Koni&s;polzki</HI> with Letters, Offers, and Expedients for a Peace: To facili|tate which, and &s;hew that the Grand Signior did heartily relent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aba&s;&s;a &s;trangled.</NOTE> <HI>Aba&s;&s;a</HI> was &s;trangled by two Kapugees, and given for a Sacrifice to appea&s;e the Anger of his Enemies; a Per&s;on who was a
<PB N="27" REF="16">&s;tout Souldier, and one who had performed great and &s;ignal Services in the War of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>But the Poles not being pacified with this &s;ingle Act of Penitence, but thir&s;ting farther after the Blood of the Turks, de&s;ired to Spoil and Pil|lage their Richer Provinces. How&s;oever at length the Council of <HI>Poland</HI> entring into more &s;erious Debates, con&s;idered, that the Troops lately come from <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> were but in a bad condition; that the part of their Army, which con&s;i&s;ted of Voluntiers, would not endure a long and tediuos War; and that the Expence and Charge of this great Army was immen&s;e and almo&s;t in&s;upportable: for which Rea&s;ons it was re&s;olved, that a Peace &s;hould be made, which was &s;oon afterwards concluded, and agreed on the&s;e following Articles.</P>
<P>That the Vaywods of <HI>Moldavia</HI> and <HI>Walachia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Articles of Peace a|greed be|tween the Poles and the Turks.</NOTE> &s;hould be confirmed by the Grand Signior, with the Con&s;ent and Recommendation of the King of <HI>Poland.</HI></P>
<P>That <HI>Cantemir</HI> and his Tartars &s;hould aban|don the Country of <HI>Buckzac;</HI> and in ca&s;e of re|fu&s;al, that then the Turk and Tartar <HI>Cham</HI> &s;hould join their Forces to expel them from thence.</P>
<P>That the Poles &s;hall &s;uppre&s;s all Acts of Ho|&s;tility of the Co&s;&s;acks in the Black Sea.</P>
<P>That the Turks renounce for ever all Demands, or future pretence of Tribute from <HI>Poland:</HI> and that they &s;hall build no new Forts on the Fron|tiers.</P>
<P>That the Navigation on the River <HI>Nieper</HI> &s;hall remain free and undi&s;turbed to the Poles. That all other Articles &s;hall remain as formerly in their ture Force and Virtue.</P>
<P>In this Year happened out great Differences between the French Amba&s;&s;ador and the Turki&s;h Officers.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Diffe|rence be|tween the French Am|ba&s;&s;ador &amp; the Captain Pa&s;ha.</NOTE> The fir&s;t Di&s;gu&s;t had its Original from the Year 1631, when the Marque&s;s of <HI>Marcheville</HI> going Amba&s;&s;ador to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> was in his Voyage met off of <HI>Scio</HI> by the Cap|tain-Pa&s;ha and his Fleet of Gallies, who imme|diately &s;ent off a Boat to advi&s;e him, that he &s;hould &s;trike his Flag, and make ready the Pre|&s;ents which were due to the Grand Signior's Admiral. <HI>Marcheville</HI> duly con&s;idering, that this Submi&s;&s;ion would blemi&s;h the Honour of his Ma&s;ter, and the Dignity of his Character, re|fu&s;ed Compliance either in one or the other; how&s;oever that he might te&s;tify the Friend&s;hip and good Corre&s;pondence which he came to confirm between the two Kings, he &s;tood off at &s;ome di&s;tance, and fired five Guns to &s;alute the Grand Signior's Standard: But the Captain-Pa&s;ha not contenting him&s;elf herewith, required the Amba&s;&s;ador to come aboard and &s;peak with him; which after divers Me&s;&s;ages from one Ve&s;|&s;el to another, the Amba&s;&s;ador was coun&s;elled to perform, not knowing how far otherwi&s;e he might engage the Honour of his Ma&s;ter. <HI>Mar|cheville</HI> being arrived at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> did great|ly complain of the Affront and Violence he re|ceived from the Captain-Pa&s;ha; which though the Grand Signior and other Mini&s;ters &s;eemed not to approve, yet the Amba&s;&s;adour received little other &s;atisfaction than fair Words and pro|mi&s;es, that his Honour &s;hould be again repai|red.</P>
<P>At the Arrival of the Sieur <HI>Marcheville,</HI> the Count <HI>Ce&s;i,</HI> who was the former Amba&s;&s;ador, was to return into <HI>France;</HI> but the Debts which he had contracted by a certain way of living, were &s;o great, that the Creditors would not &s;uffer him to depart without paiment; for De|fault of which, he endured many Affronts of|fered to his own Per&s;on, and was detained at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> until this Year 1634; during which time the Marque&s;, <HI>Marcheville</HI> managed all the Affairs of the Emba&s;&s;y; who keeping &s;till in mind the Affront offered him before <HI>Scio,</HI> watched all Opportunities to di&s;parage the Actions and Per&s;on of the Captain-Pa&s;ha; who at length re|turning from the Black Sea, where he had &s;ome Succe&s;s again&s;t the Co&s;&s;acks, was graciou&s;ly re|ceived by the Grand Signior; and being adver|ti&s;ed, how, during his ab&s;ence, the French Am|ba&s;&s;ador had endeavoured to bla&s;t his Reputati|on by many In&s;tances of Diminution, which he often inculcated by his Druggerman, took Ad|vantage of the Grand Signior's good Humor, to vent before him the re&s;entment which he con|ceived thereof: The Grand Signior, to gratify the Pa&s;ha, promi&s;ed to hang the Druggerman; which the Pa&s;ha acknowledged as a &s;ingular Fa|vour, and returned from the Pre&s;ence of the Sultan full of Joy and Contentment. But better to cover his Malice, and to en&s;nare the Poor Wretch, he &s;ent a Me&s;&s;enger to the Amba&s;&s;ador, a&s;&s;uring him that he de&s;ired his Friend&s;hip; and that there might be a right under&s;tanding be|tween them, he per&s;waded him to &s;end his Druggerman to him, that by his Mouth he might &s;ignify the e&s;teem he had for the Amba&s;&s;ador, from who&s;e Spirits he was willing to take off all Jealou&s;ies and Umbrages of Di&s;content.</P>
<P>The Amba&s;&s;ador not &s;u&s;pecting the perfidi|ou&s;ne&s;s of the Pa&s;ha,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The French Drugger|man hanged</NOTE> &s;ent his Druggerman to him; hwo being come within his Power, was im|mediately hanged by the Grand Signior's expre&s;s Command, and ordered that he &s;hould remain on the Gallows with his Velvet Cap on his Head, which in this Sultan's Reign all Druggermen wore to di&s;tingui&s;h them from others.</P>
<P>The Amba&s;&s;ador complained greatly of this Affront, nad Violation of Articles, to the Chi|macam and other Officers, but could receive no other An&s;wer or Satisfaction, than that the Grand Signior might execute Ju&s;tice as he plea|&s;ed on his Subjects, without asking leave, or concerning the King of <HI>France</HI> or his Amba&s;&s;ador in the Matter.</P>
<P>But <HI>Marcheville</HI> not re&s;ting &s;atisfied with this Reply, &s;till pro&s;ecuted his Pique and Animo&s;ity to &s;uch a height, that the Captain-Pa&s;ha farther incen&s;ed thereat, obtained Authority form the Grand Signior to di&s;patch him away: &s;o that &s;ending one day for <HI>Marcheville,</HI> and fir&s;t re|proaching his Contrivances and De&s;igns again&s;t him, told him plainly, that it was the Grand Signior's Plea&s;ure that he &s;hould depart at that in&s;tant; to which he con&s;trained the Amba&s;&s;ador &s;o precipitately, that he would not give him time to adverti&s;e his Servants,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sieur <HI>Marche|ville forci|bly &s;ent a|way.</HI></NOTE> or make up his Baggage, but forced him aboard a French Ship then in Port, which he immediatly compelled to &s;ail; and the Wind being contrary, cau&s;ed the Ve&s;&s;el to be toaed abroad by two Gallies into the open Sea of the <HI>Propontis.</HI></P>
<P>After the injurious departure of this Amba&s;|&s;ador, the Count <HI>Ce&s;i,</HI> who had been detained at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> for the Rea&s;ons before denoted, took again upon him the Function of Amba&s;&s;ador. To execute which, in better advantage of Trade and Commerce, he was advi&s;ed to a compliance with the Captain-Pa&s;ha, and to u&s;e &s;uch Means as might mitigate that Acrimony of Spirit which this Pa&s;ha nouri&s;hed again&s;t the French Nation.</P>
<P>The&s;e Di&s;putes between the French and the Turki&s;h Officers, revived certain Di&s;gu&s;ts and Aver&s;ion again&s;t all the Frank Nations, which favoured the Latine Rites; &s;o that in de&s;pight
<PB N="28" REF="17">to them, the Grand Signior re&s;tored again <HI>Cy|rillus</HI> the Patriarch to the Patriarchal Juri&s;dicti|on, who had long been per&s;ecuted by the Je&s;u|its, and by their Means been depo&s;ed, promi|&s;ing that for the future he &s;hould continue undi|&s;turbed, in oppo&s;ition to all tho&s;e of the Roman Religion.</P>
<P>The Peace (as we have &s;aid) being conclu|ded with <HI>Poland,</HI> the Grand Signior was more at Iei&s;ure to attend the Wars in <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> with the Labours and Toils of which the Jani&s;aries being wearied, began new Troubles and Seditions in the Camp; the which Di&s;order <HI>Morat</HI> attribu|ting to the negligence or cowardi&s;e of the Offi|cers, as wanting Courage to &s;uppre&s;s them, &s;um|moned the Jani&s;ar-Aga to appear before him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts of Cruelty.</NOTE> and without long Proce&s;s or Excu&s;e cut off his Head, and confi&s;cated his E&s;tate to the Exche|quer, which amounted to a Million and &s;eventy thou&s;and Dollars: another Jani&s;ary al&s;o, more rich than &s;editious, was in like manner &s;acri|ficed, and an hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and Dollars of his E&s;tate added to the Trea&s;ury of the Sul|tan. The Pa&s;ha al&s;o of <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> with &s;everal other Officers of the Army enriched with Spoils of the People, fell a Sacrifice to <HI>Morat</HI>'s Avarice and Cruelty; to whom Riches and Blood were &s;o plea&s;ing, that none acquired a higher degree of Grace in his Favour, than tho&s;e who could give him notice of opulent Men, who having found Riches, he undertook to find them Guilty, and to prove their Wealth &s;o corrupted by ex|tortion and violence, that nothing could hallow or purifie it but his Coffers.</P>
<P>The next News from <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> brought advice, that that King at the Head of a powerful Army was encamped in the Country about <HI>Van,</HI> with which the Turks not having &s;ufficient Force to fight, the Vizier wrote to the Grand Signior, that his Pre&s;ence was nece&s;&s;ary to increa&s;e the Army, and encourage the Souldiery; whereupon he re&s;olved to leave <HI>Adrianople,</HI> and transfer his Court to his Seraglio at <HI>Scutari,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The G.

<P>But what &s;hewed much of the fierce Spirit of the Sultan, was a certain Fury which he concei|ved on this occa&s;ion. On a certain day, riding on his Hor&s;e, thirty Indian Pilgrims met him in the way to demand his Charity, and being in a dif|ferent habit to what the Turks wear, and not accu&s;tomary in that Country, the Grand Signi|or's Hor&s;e &s;tarted at the &s;ight of them; and be|ing &s;purred for bogling in that manner, the Hor&s;e capred and reared an end, &s;o that he threw his Rider; at which the Grand Signior being high|ly enraged, drew out his Cemiter, and with his own hand killed his Hor&s;e, and in&s;tead of Alms, prepared a place of Entertainment in the Gallies for tho&s;e unhappy Indians.</P>
<P>The Grand Signior being returned to his Pa|lace at <HI>Scutari,</HI> which is &s;eated on the A&s;ian &s;ide oppo&s;ite to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The G.

The Officers of the Army contended to out-vy each the other in their Pre&s;ents to the Grand Signior, &s;ome furni&s;hed him with Royal Tents, others with curious and light Arms; and others with Hor&s;es and Furnitures of value. Great Sums of Mony were extracted out of the Exchequer for Military Preparations and Paiments of the Soul|diery. The Charge of Affairs, in ab&s;ence of the Grand Signior, was committed to the Bo|&s;tangi-ba&s;hee, who was made Chimacam of <HI>Con|&s;tantinople;</HI> and &s;o with a fierce Spirit, and a&s;pect full of Indignation and Anger, he mounted his Hor&s;e at the Head of an Army of an hundred thou&s;and; he departed from <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> about the end of <HI>April.</HI></P>
<P>But before we recount the particulars of what &s;ucceeded in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> it is requi&s;ite to ca&s;t our Thoughts back to the Troubles of <HI>Tran&s;ylvania,</HI> occa&s;ioned by the competition of <HI>Stephen Bethlem</HI> and <HI>George Ragotski,</HI> for that Principality.</P>
<P><HI>Bethlem</HI> (as we have &s;aid before) being grie|ved and di&s;contented at his hard Fortune in being put by the Government,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bethlem</HI> renews his Complaints to the Grand Signior.</NOTE> and re&s;enting the Pu|ni&s;hment which <HI>Ragotski</HI> inflicted on his Son for the Crime of Man&s;laughter, he went to <HI>Buda,</HI> and there renewing his old Complaints to the Pa&s;ha, he was, with Recommendations from him, accompanied to the Port; where being introdu|ced to the Pre&s;ence of the chief Mini&s;ters, he at large declared the Merits and good Services of his Family towards the Sultan:<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Rea&s;ons to be re-in|&s;tated.</NOTE> <Q>That for this Rea&s;on only, in di&s;honour and de&s;pight to the Ottoman Empire, he was excluded from the Government, and therefore challenged its A&s;&s;i|&s;tance to re-e&s;tabli&s;h him therein; in con&s;idera|tion of which, he promi&s;ed the &s;ame Faithful|ne&s;s and Devotion to the Sultan, which was profe&s;&s;ed and maintained by his Ance&s;tors, and was natural to the Family of <HI>Gabor.</HI> That as to <HI>Ragotski</HI> it was apparent, that he entertained different Principles; that he was a Per&s;on of elated Thoughts, and a Turbulent Spirit, and was ever united in Combination with the Em|peror, Germans, and other Enemies to the Ot|toman State.</Q></P>
<P>The Turks moved with the&s;e Rea&s;ons, re&s;ol|ved to favour <HI>Stephen,</HI> and to di&s;countenance <HI>Ra|gotski;</HI> and though the Conjuncture of Affairs was &s;uch, as that any other Engagement in War, be&s;ides that of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> did not &s;quare with the pre&s;ent De&s;igns; yet at all times it was judged convenient to &s;ow the Tares of Di&s;cord, and promote Differences among&s;t Chri&s;tians, which have ever produced Advantages to the Mahome|tan Cau&s;e. And likewi&s;e the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Buda</HI> was commanded to enter <HI>Tran&s;ylvania</HI> with a Force &s;ufficient to contend with <HI>Ragotski;</HI> and le&s;t the Emperor &s;hould be allarm'd with this Commoti|on, a Chiaus was di&s;patched to give him a per|fect under&s;tanding of the Rea&s;ons, why an Army marched into <HI>Tran&s;ylvania;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Turks &s;end an Ar|my into <HI>Tran&s;yl|vania.</HI></NOTE> the De&s;ign of which was not intended in the lea&s;t manner to impeach the Articles of Peace between him and the Grand Signior, but only to di&s;place a Man of a furious and turbulent Spirit, and to ordain another in his &s;tead of a more lober and quiet Temper, by who&s;e Moderation and Prudence, the Peace be|tween

<P><HI>Ragotski</HI> &s;tartled at this De&s;ign intended again&s;t him,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ragotski</HI> implores Aid from the Empe|ror.</NOTE> a&s;&s;embled the States of his Country, to de|termine and con&s;ult concerning a Remedy, and immediately di&s;patched a Me&s;&s;enger to the Em|peror, to de&s;ire and implore his Imperial Suc|cour and Protection: and though <HI>Ragotski</HI> was &s;en&s;ible of the di&s;parity of his Strength, in com|pari&s;on of that of the Turks; yet neither did his Coun&s;els nor Behaviour betray Fear or want of Con&s;tancy.</P>
<P>The Hungarians &s;econded tho&s;e In&s;tances which <HI>Ragotski</HI> had made at the Imperial Court, and the Party which he had made at <HI>Vienna</HI> brought the matter to a debate in Council, which was argued on both &s;ides with &s;olid and convin|cing Rea&s;ons. Tho&s;e who &s;pake in disfavour of <HI>Ragotski,</HI> alledged, That all A&s;&s;i&s;tance contribu|ted to him would be a ju&s;t Cau&s;e and Pretence to the Grand Signior to make War with the Em|peror. That <HI>Ragotski</HI> him&s;elf was of an unquiet Temper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">It is deba|ted in Council.</NOTE> not unlike to <HI>Gabor</HI> his Predece&s;&s;or, who had often bid Defiance to the Emperor, and over-running all <HI>Hungary</HI> and <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> had often erected his Standard in the &s;ight of <HI>Vienna.</HI> To protect and cheri&s;h a Per&s;on of this Di&s;po&s;ition, was no other than to nouri&s;h a Serpent or Viper in their Bo&s;om; who being elevated at the ex|pence of the Empire in &s;ucce&s;&s;es again&s;t the Turk, would convert that Power which he had gained to the damage of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> combi|ning with the Faction of other Princes to procure its de&s;truction. Let us therefore, &s;aid they, &s;tand at a gaze, and as Men on the Shore, or in a good Port, behold the agitation of Ships in the Ocean; perhaps the change of a Prince in <HI>Tran|&s;ylvania</HI> may turn to our Benefit, and one may &s;ucceed into the place, of &s;uch a mild Temper and &s;erene Di&s;po&s;ition, as may better agree with the Maxims of this Court, and may cultivate that Peace which can only render the&s;e Countries hap|py.</P>
<P>How&s;oever there were other Opinions to the contrary, among&s;t which it is &s;aid, that D. <HI>An|nibal Gonzaga,</HI> a Per&s;on acquainted with the State of <HI>Tran&s;ylvania,</HI> and of the Turks, and Director of the Imperial Army, delivered him&s;elf in this manner.</P>
<FLOATEXT LANG="eng" TYPE="text">
<HEAD>May it plea&s;e Your Sacred Imperial Maje&s;ty.</HEAD>
<P>IF Ragotski <HI>had been the Lawful Son and Hereditary Succe&s;&s;or of</HI> Gabor, <HI>who was an Enemy to your Maje&s;ty, we might then appre|hend the evil Con&s;equences of a Son, that tra|ces the &s;ame Path and Foot&s;teps of his Father. But here is another Per&s;on, another Prince, in Emulation different, and by Enmity hating the Hou&s;e of</HI> Gabor; <HI>wherefore I cannot imagine how this Prince can po&s;&s;ibly entertain Maxims of like Nature with the other. For my part I believe, that it behoves your Maje&s;ty to main|tain a good Corre&s;pondence with the Princes of</HI> Tran&s;ylvania, <HI>by a clo&s;e &V;nion again&s;t the Turk; your adjoining Countries being like con|tiguous Buildings, which are &s;trengthned by a mutual Support: Let us therefore &s;upport it; for if it depends not on us, it will be over|run, and remain oppre&s;&s;ed without us. To ag|gravate the Faults of</HI> Gabor <HI>to the di&s;parage|ment of</HI> Ragotski, <HI>is no Logical Con&s;equence, unle&s;s you will argue, That the Faults of the Guilty are to be puni&s;hed on the Innocent. Let us therefore con&s;ider, which agrees be&s;t with the Security of the Empire; that</HI> Tran|&s;ylvania <HI>&s;hould remain in the Hands of</HI> Ra|gotski, <HI>or of the Turk; or that we had bet|ter &s;trike again&s;t the Rock of Jealou&s;ie, which we conceive again&s;t this Tran&s;ylvanian, or on that ruinous Rock of the Turki&s;h Power. The Ottoman Councils commonly look a&s;quint, they ca&s;t their Eye on the Prince, when their &s;ight aims at the Principality; and threaten the Per|&s;on, when they de&s;ign to vent their Fury to the &s;ubjection of his Country. The true Intent of the Turk is to reduce</HI> Tran&s;ylvania <HI>to the &s;ame Condition with</HI> Moldavia <HI>and</HI> Walachia, <HI>and to incorporate this, with infinite other Provin|ces, into the gro&s;s Body of his Empire. It is notorious to all the World, that the Empe|rors, your Predece&s;&s;ors, have lo&s;t a large Tract of Land by the Turks; and your Lo&s;&s;es will every day be greater, as their Conque&s;ts in|crea&s;e: And when their Dominions in</HI> Europe <HI>are &s;o enlarged, that they are able to quarter their A&s;iatick Cavalry in the&s;e Countries, your Dangers mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be inevitable and full of Terror. For I compute, that when the Turk de&s;igns to make War upon us, he mar|ches with an hundred thou&s;and Men, and per|haps ten thou&s;and Camels, be&s;ides other Bea&s;ts of Burden: &s;o numerous a Body as this can|not be maintained until the Gra&s;s be fully grown, which is not until the middle or end of</HI> June; <HI>and from that time they have more than a month or &s;ix weeks March before they arrive upon our Confines; the which con&s;ump|tion of Time, prolongs their Enterpri&s;es, and protracts the time of our Damages. But if once they become Ma&s;ters of</HI> Tran&s;ylvania, <HI>and that that Country be laid to</HI> Moldavia, Walachia, <HI>and other parts of</HI> Hungary, <HI>they may then commodiou&s;ly winter amongst us, and begin their Wars and Attempts upon us early in the Year, and pur&s;ue them until the la&s;t &s;ea&s;on of the Autumn: and in this man|ner, whil&s;t we are debating and taking our Mea&s;ures in our Diet, they will fatten them|&s;elves, and &s;atiate their Appetites with our Spoils. It is good therefore for us to defend</HI> Au&s;tria <HI>in</HI> Tran&s;ylvania, <HI>keeping the Fever as far from the Heart as we are able. Let us &s;uppo&s;e, that</HI> Ragotski <HI>is the mo&s;t ungrateful Man in the World; and that after we have &s;upported and &s;uccoured him, that he will re|ver&s;e his Arms upon us: How&s;oever he is not &s;o &s;trong and con&s;iderable as to do us much hurt, and therefore it were better to have him our Neighbour and our Enemy, than the Turk, though our Friend; the fir&s;t can only admini|&s;ter &s;ome little cau&s;e of Jealou&s;ie, but the other may de&s;troy and &s;upplant us; the fir&s;t is but like a putrid Fever, which is cured with every &s;mall Evacuation; but the latter is a Pe&s;ti|lence, which dilates and diffu&s;es it &s;elf, and is deadly and irrecoverable. Let not the Scruple neither of breaking with the Turk trouble us;
<PB N="30" REF="18">for we may admini&s;ter A&s;&s;i&s;tance under-hand, and without noi&s;e effect our Bu&s;ine&s;s, without arriving at the extremity of a Rupture. It is folly and weakne&s;s in us to be charmed by the Flatteries of the Turks, and the fair words of this Chaous; or to imagine, that when they have over-run all</HI> Tran&s;ylvania, <HI>they will &s;top in the mid&s;t of their Career, before they ar|rive at the Gates of</HI> Vienna; <HI>no, their In|tentions are to lull us a&s;leep, and to de&s;troy our Neighbour fir&s;t, and then us; they cannot devour us both at once, but husband their Diet, and re&s;erve us for another Meal. The Turk is like a Serpent, who lies quiet and coiled up all the Winter; not becau&s;e he wants either a Sting or Poi&s;on, but being benummed with cold, wants warmth and heat to give it Motion and Operation.

<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e convining Arguments,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Empe|ror refu&s;es Succour to <HI>Ragotski.</HI></NOTE> the Re&s;ult of the Council determined otherwi&s;e, and <HI>Ragotski</HI> was left to &s;hift for him&s;elf, and to &s;tand upon his own Legs; which was a perni|cious Re&s;olution, and that which was afterwards the cau&s;e of the &s;ubjection of <HI>Tran&s;ylvania</HI> to the Turk, and the Original of many Mi&s;chiefs to the Empire; but thus was the Fortune of the Turks, more favourable to them than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">o the Chri&s;tian State.</P>
<P><HI>Ragotski</HI> being thus abandoned by the Impe|riali&s;ts, and expo&s;ed to the Mercy of an in&s;atia|ble Enemy, though his Courage was good and re&s;olute, yet he began to de&s;pond of his Force, unable to deal with &s;uch an unequal Match as that of the Turks; And his Subjects being fear|ful of the Event, per&s;waded him to give way, and re&s;ign his Rule to the hands of <HI>Gabor</HI> his Competitor; <HI>Ragotski,</HI> that he might not &s;eem to neglect the Coun&s;el of his Subjects and Friends, and to gain Time, pretended to hear|ken to their Advice;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ragotski</HI> obtains Suc|cours under|hand.</NOTE> and accordingly entred in|to a Treaty with <HI>Gabor.</HI> During which Debate he &s;ecretly obtained &s;ome Forces from <HI>Poland,</HI> by connivance of that Government: and the Hungarians being his Friends, privately favoured him, knowing that the Conque&s;t of <HI>Tran&s;ylvania</HI> would be a &s;tep to their De&s;truction; and being at length well fortified and recruited, he began to declare openly, that he found no &s;ecurity to him&s;elf in this Surrender, for that a Place was denied him, wherein he put his chief hopes of Defence; and therefore that he was re&s;olved to &s;upport and maintain his State and Cau&s;e in the be&s;t manner that he was able.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Turks enter <HI>Tran|&s;ylvania.</HI></NOTE></P>

<P>The Turks perceiving their advantage in num|ber, re&s;olved to engage the Enemy before they were reinforced with new Succours; to perform which they made a Detachment of twelve thou|&s;and Hor&s;e, and two thou&s;and Jani&s;aries, and &s;ome Field Pieces, commanded by the Pa&s;ha him|&s;elf and <HI>Stephen Gabor.

<P>So &s;oon as this News arrived the Ears of the proud Sultan, he was &s;o incen&s;ed, that in a fury he would have de&s;i&s;ted from his pre&s;ent War in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> to vent his Revenge upon <HI>Tran&s;ylvania;</HI> but the cooler and more moderate Coun&s;els of wi&s;er Friends, advi&s;ed him to defer the execu|tion of his Anger, until he could di&s;charge it more to the purpo&s;e, and in a Conjuncture when it would fall more ea&s;y on him&s;elf, and more heavy on his Enemy: How&s;oever in the mean time <HI>Ragotski</HI> made &s;uch u&s;e of this remote Di|ver&s;ion of the Ottoman Arms, by advantaging him&s;elf of an Alliance with the Co&s;&s;acks, and by the ill Corre&s;pondence and Diffidence which at that time intervened between the Tartars and the Port, that he not only avoided the Revenge threatned by <HI>Morat,</HI> but obtained an e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the Inheritance to his Son.</P>
<P>By this time Sultan <HI>Morat</HI> was arrived at <HI>Erzrum,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Morat <HI>at</HI> Erzrum.</NOTE> which is a City belonging to the Turks on the Confines of <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> where the fir&s;t Act which he performed of Ju&s;tice, was to cut off the Head of the Pa&s;ha for his Oppre&s;&s;ion and Extortions inflicted on his People.</P>
<P>Entring into <HI>Armenia,</HI> he was grieved to &s;ee the upper and lower Provinces &s;o mi&s;erably de|&s;troyed and wa&s;ted by the War; to recover which, he commanded the People, under pain of Death, to return again to their Ancient Ha|bitations within the &s;pace of twenty days; but

<P>About the beginning of <HI>July,</HI> in the parts of <HI>Erzrum, Morat</HI> made a general Review and Mu|&s;ter of his whole Army; with which tho&s;e he brought from <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> joined to Recruits by the way, and tho&s;e Forces which had wa|ged War in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> amounted to near the num|ber of three hundred thou&s;and fighting Men, but &s;uch as were admirably well di&s;ciplined, not only by the Severity of their Soveraign, but by the example he &s;hewed them of Frugality and Patience: for he often marched afoot in the mid&s;t of the Heats;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Grand Signior's Patience &amp; Labours.</NOTE> he was very temperate in his Diet, though he was naturally of a glutto|nous and luxurious Palate: for &s;everal Months he made u&s;e of no other Pillow for his Head than his Saddle, no other Blanket or Quilt than the Covering or Foot-cloth of his Hor&s;e.</P>

<P>The News of this pro&s;perous Succe&s;s was po&s;ted to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> as the fir&s;t E&s;&s;ay of the good Effects of the Sultan's Pre&s;ence, and was there celebrated with Fea&s;ts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rejoycing and a Fe|&s;tival kept for it at <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople.</HI></NOTE> Joy, and Lights, according to the Turki&s;h Fa&s;hion, called <HI>Da|nalma;</HI> to perform which, the Turks obliged likewi&s;e the Chri&s;tian Amba&s;&s;adors, &s;aying, That if they were Friends, they ought to evidence their Satisfaction, by demon&s;trations of Joy in the pro&s;perity of their Ally.</P>

Bajazet</HI> and <HI>Orchan</HI> were &s;trangled; the latter of which, as is &s;aid, was &s;o brave, and of that Courage, that he killed four of his Executioners before he &s;ubmitted his Neck to the fatal Cord.</P>
<P>The Turks entring farther into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> incon|&s;iderately fell into an Ambu&s;h, where twelve thou&s;and of their Men were defeated; how&s;o|ever the remainder of the Army not being di&s;|couraged with this Encounter, proceeded on their March, making mo&s;t mi&s;erable Havock and De&s;truction of all before them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Turks enter far|ther into <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></NOTE> carrying that Dread and Terrour to the Countries round, that all People fled, leaving their Hou&s;es and Things not portable, to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Enemy. How&s;oever the Turks found greater Difficulties than they expected; for meeting frequently Par|ties of the Per&s;ian Cavalry, which were practi|&s;ed to manage their Hor&s;e and Sword, were often defeated, at lea&s;t endured and &s;u&s;tained the &s;hock of Bloody Skirmi&s;hes; and then the Per&s;ians re|tiring into the Mountains known to them, but unknown to the Turks, which &s;erved them bet|ter than fortified Places, returned again when any Advantage or Booty appeared, which perpe|tually vexed and wearied the Enemy; and burn|ing all Things which might afford them relief, rendred that fruitful Country more De&s;olate and barren than the De&s;arts of <HI>Lybia,</HI> or the Sands of <HI>Arabia.</HI></P>
<P>In this manner the Turki&s;h Army being de&s;ti|tute of all &s;orts of Provi&s;ions and Refre&s;hments, were forced to retire to the Country of <HI>Tauris;</HI> which being hara&s;&s;ed and impoveri&s;hed like o|ther Provinces, cau&s;ed a mi&s;erable Famine in the Camp, whereby Multitudes of Hor&s;es and Ca|mels peri&s;hed for want of Nutriment; at which the Grand Signior being highly incen&s;ed again&s;t the Inhabitants of <HI>Tauris,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tauris</HI> de|&s;troyed.</NOTE> committed their City to the Will and Mercy of the Souldiery, who having pillaged and &s;acked it, le&s;t it a mi&s;erable &s;pectacle of Fire and Sword.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> &s;eeing in what manner the Troops of his Enemy were wearied and con&s;u|med, took hold of this Opportunity as &s;ea&s;onable to propo&s;e certain Articles of Peace by an Am|ba&s;&s;ador, to which <HI>Morat</HI> &s;eemed to incline a flexible Ear; but lodging his Souldiers in their Winter-quarters in the parts of <HI>Dama&s;cus</HI> and <HI>Aleppo,</HI> he took his way towards <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> with intention to ea&s;e the Hard&s;hips and Labours of the Summers War, by a voluptuous Ea&s;e and Winters pa&s;time in the delights and &s;oftne&s;s of the Seraglio.</P>
<P>The <HI>16th</HI> day of <HI>December</HI> he arrived at <HI>Con|&s;tantinople,</HI> having pa&s;&s;ed from <HI>I&s;mit</HI> through the Gulph of <HI>Nicomedia</HI> with the attendance of four|teen Gallies: he made his Entry by the Jews Gate, and not by that of <HI>Adrianople,</HI> as was ac|cu&s;tomary; he was mounted on one of the be&s;t of his Hor&s;es, and cloathed with a Coat of Mail, a Casket on his Head, with three Feathers ador|ned with Pearls and precious Stones; his Sword was girt to his &s;ide with his Bow and Quiver, his Beard was in a rough and neglected manner, which made him appear more Fierce and Marti|al; the Chimacam came after him, accompanied with the Traitor who &s;urrendred <HI>Revan.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fe&s;tival for return of the G.

The&s;e Murmurings of the People were not without &s;ome Ground and Cau&s;e; for after the departure of the Grand Signior, the Per&s;ians put them&s;elves again into the Field, and recovered the Country which they had lo&s;t; and having
<PB N="32" REF="19">offered a Sum of Mony to <HI>Morte&s;a</HI> Pa&s;ha to &s;ur|render <HI>Revan;</HI> which he refu&s;ing to accept on Principles of Fidelity and Honour, they prepa|red to lay clo&s;e Siege to the Place: the Jani&s;aries were al&s;o di&s;plea&s;ed to &s;ee them&s;elves neglected, and ca&s;t out of the Guard, and their Places &s;up|plied by the Bo&s;tangees; nor le&s;s di&s;gu&s;ted were the Lawyers to &s;ee &s;everal of their Judges and Kadies handged, and their Heads cut off, upon pretence of Sedition and Faction. His ill Hu|mor more incea&s;ed to the height of Tyranny, by rea&s;on of certain twinges which he &s;uffered of the Gout, which is not u&s;ual in Per&s;ons of his Age, not &s;urpa&s;&s;ing twenty &s;ix years; and becau&s;e his Phy&s;ician, a Jew, forbid him wholly to drink Wine, as poi&s;on to his Di&s;ea&s;e and Com|plexion, he was &s;o enraged, that he drove him from his Pre&s;ence with Indignation; and im|mediately conceived &s;uch Anger and Prejudice a|gain&s;t the whole Nation, that he cau&s;ed their Hou&s;es to be &s;earched, and their Jewels taken from them. But what was mo&s;t &s;trange, was his horrid aver&s;ion to Tobacco,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His aver&s;i|on to To|bacco.</NOTE> the taking of which, by any Per&s;on what&s;oever, he forbid upon pain of Death; which Sentence he &s;o ri|gorou&s;ly executed, that he cau&s;ed the Legs and Arms of two Men, one that &s;old Tobacco, and the other that took it, to be &s;awed off, and in that manner expo&s;ed to the view of the People: he al&s;o cau&s;ed two others, a Man and a Woman, to be impaled alive, for the &s;ame Offence, with a Roll of Tabaco about their Necks.</P>
<P>As the Gout cau&s;ed him to be froward and ill-natur'd, &s;o more e&s;pecially when ill news came from <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> he was ob&s;erved to be more raving and tyrannical than ever. His Army in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> wanting Provi&s;ions, disbanded; <HI>Morte&s;a</HI> Pa&s;ha Godvernour of <HI>Revan</HI> being killed, the Souldiers rebel,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Revan</HI> re|gained by the Per&s;ian.</NOTE> open the Gates, and yeild them&s;elves to the per&s;ian, for which Offence the Jani&s;aries fearing the Ju&s;tice of their Ma&s;ter the Grand Signior, two thou&s;and of them took up Arms in Service of the Enemy: the &s;en&s;e hereof vexing <HI>Morat</HI> to the Soul, he cau&s;ed the Regi&s;ter of the Jani&s;aries to be hanged, and another of their principal Officers to be beheaded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Grand Signior's Severity &amp; Cruelty.</NOTE> and &s;trowed the Streets of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> with dead Bodies, &s;ome for one cau&s;e, and &s;ome for another, which &s;truch the whole City with a general Dread and Con&s;ternation.</P>
<P>He often walked in the night, puni&s;hing Quar|rels and Di&s;orders of the Streets, and meeting two Women wandring in the dark, he cau&s;ed them to be cut in pieces.</P>
<P>He put hi Cook to Death for not dre&s;&s;ing his Meat well, or not &s;ea&s;oning his Sauces according to his Palate.</P>
<P>In his Seraglio &s;porting with his Arms, he wounded him&s;elf with a Dart in the thigh; and by accident wounded the Son of <HI>Mehmet</HI> the late Vizier with a Carbine-&s;hot, of which in a &s;hort time after he died.</P>
<P>The Per&s;ians having taken <HI>Revan</HI> (as we have &s;aid) in&s;tituted Chambers of Jani&s;aries in that place after the Turki&s;h fa&s;hion, paying them in the &s;ame form as at <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> and to allure the Spahees to enter into his Service, he offered to all that came in twelve A&s;pers a day of con|&s;tant Pay; and declared, That their Faith and Law had no difference from the Mahometan.</P>
<P>The Grand Signior receiving the&s;e Advices with extreme indignation, proclaimed his Inten|tions to return again into <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> and though the De&s;ign plea&s;ed not the Militia, who wre weary of the War, yet his Power was too great to be re&s;i&s;ted, and his Humors too violent to be diverted by &s;ober Coun&s;els; for having &s;ubjected and ab&s;olutely &s;ubdued the In&s;olence of the Soul|diers, and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the Arrogance of the Law|yers and Church-men, he ordered every thing according to his Arbitrary and Uncontroulable Plea&s;ure; which being rendred Extravagant and Un&s;upportable, by rea&s;on that in his Cups, and at the time of his Debauchery, he would often take his Coun&s;els and determine his Re&s;o|lutions, were notwith&s;tanding with more patience endured, upon hopes that they would not be la&s;ting, and that Exce&s;&s;es would accelerate his Death, and the end of their Oppre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>The Pa&s;ha's of greate&s;t Note and Riches he put to Death, and confi&s;cated their E&s;tates to his Exchequer; and whereas Avarice and Cru|elty were equally predominant in his Nature, there was &s;carce a day wherein he made not &s;ome demon&s;tration of tho&s;e Di&s;po&s;itions.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h Amba&s;&s;ador making &s;ome in&s;tan|ces for the relea&s;ement of Engli&s;h Slaves from Captivity, was forced to purcha&s;e their Liberty by giving two Ru&s;&s;ians, or other Slaves in the place of one Engli&s;h-man.</P>
<P>He took a &s;ingular delight to &s;it in a Chiosk by the Sea-&s;ide, and from thence to &s;hoot at the People with his Bow and Arrows, as they row|ed near the Banks of the Seraglio; which cau|&s;ed the Boat-men afterwards to keep them&s;elves at a di&s;tance from the Walls of the Seraglio. And as he likewi&s;e took plea&s;ure to go from one Garden to another on the <HI>Bo&s;phorus,</HI> &s;o if he ob|&s;erved any &s;o bold, as to put forth his Head to &s;ee him pa&s;s, he commonly made him pay the price of his Curio&s;ity by a &s;hot from his Car|bine.</P>
<P>In all his Gardens and places of Plea&s;ure, his chief Recreation was Drinking, in which his prin|cipal or almo&s;t &s;ole Companions were Emir <HI>Gu|mir</HI> the Per&s;ian who betrayed <HI>Revan,</HI> and a Ve|netian of the Family of <HI>Bianchi,</HI> who having been taken by the Turks, when he was young, was placed in the Seraglio, and educated in all the Learning and Cu&s;toms of it, and becoming as well a Proficient in Drinking, as in other Vi|ces, he was made a Favourite and Companion to <HI>Morat.</HI> And thus did they follow this trade of Drunkenne&s;s &s;o con&s;tantly, that the Health of the Grand Signior began to impair; and at length he became &s;o &s;en&s;ible of his Extravagan|cies, that he incharged the Chimacam not to obey him after Dinner: and when in the heat of his Wine he took a humor to ride through the Streets, the Jani&s;aires and Officers would &s;ometimes run before to advi&s;e the People to withdraw, and &s;ometimes drive them away with Stones, that &s;o they might e&s;cape the hazard of this capricious Tyrant.</P>
<P>As it cannot be expre&s;&s;ed in what Dread and Fear the People &s;tood of him, &s;o neither in what Veneration he was with his Servants, who ob&s;er|ved the looks and every ca&s;t of his Eyes; had learned his Nods, and the meaning of every Motion and Ge&s;ture of his Body. It happened once, that a Paper falling ca&s;ually from his Hand out of a Window, the Pages ran in all ha&s;te down the Stairs, &s;triving who &s;hould be the fir&s;t to take it up; but one more de&s;irous than the others to evidence the Zeal of his Ser|vice, took the neare&s;t way and leaped out of the Window; and though with the fall he broke the Bone of his Thigh, yet being the fir&s;t that took up the Paper, he came halting to pre&s;ent it with his own Hand: this bold readine&s;s in his Service &s;o plea&s;ed the Grand Signior, that being cured, he was afterwards preferred to one of
<PB N="33" REF="19">the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Offices of the Empire. Thus was <HI>Morat</HI> revered in his Seraglio, as he was feared aboard, his Servants having the &s;ame awe of him, as <HI>Bagotes</HI> the Eunuch had of <HI>Alex|ander</HI> the Great, who holding the Pot of Incen&s;e and Perfumes whil&s;t his Ma&s;ter &s;lept, &s;uffered his Hands to burn to the Bone, rather than to awaken him by moving out of his place. <HI>Q. Cur|tius.</HI></P>
<P>But it is time now to leave off farther Di&s;|cour&s;e of the Extravagancies of <HI>Morat,</HI> and to return to the Wars in <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> how&s;oever before the departure of the Grand Signior, it will be requi&s;ite to recount &s;omewhat of the State of Affairs in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>On the Frontiers of <HI>Hungary</HI> and <HI>Poland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;turban|ces in <HI>Po|land</HI> and <HI>Hungary.</HI></NOTE> there wanted not Exerci&s;es and Skirmi&s;hes to employ and practi&s;e the Souldiery, and keep them in Breath.</P>
<P>The Poles heightned with their good Succe&s;&s;es, would not longer endure the Incur&s;ions of the Tartars, complaining again&s;t the Turk, that he had given Orders, and &s;ecretly abetted them in their Robberies and Inva&s;ions, again&s;t the Arti|cles of the la&s;t Peace; and therefore to avenge them&s;elves, the Poles appeared on the Fron|tiers with forty or fifty thou&s;and Hor&s;e: but the Grand Signior not willing in this Conjuncture to break with the Poles, ab&s;olutely di&s;owned a|ny &s;uch Order or Permi&s;&s;ion given to the Tar|tars; and being willing to continue the League, that he might oblige the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> gave liberty to all the People of that Nation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Turks confirm the Peace with <HI>Poland.</HI></NOTE> and to the Ru&s;&s;ians, who had been taken &s;ince the La&s;t Treaty, po&s;itively prohibiting all People from buying, or keeping any of the Subjects of that Country for Slaves, during the continuance of this Peace.</P>
<P>In <HI>Hungary,</HI> though the Amba&s;&s;ador had but lately brought a Confirmation of the Peace from <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> yet the Turks pretending that the Articles were not complied with, continued to trouble and di&s;turb tho&s;e Frontiers; for four thou&s;and of them being gotten into a Body, burnt certain Villages, made divers Slaves, and battered the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Raab;</HI> but being repul&s;ed by that Gari&s;on, and by that of <HI>Komorra,</HI> they again made Head, and encamped within three Leagues of <HI>Presbourg:</HI> The which gave great trouble to the Emperor, both becau&s;e he had lately declared a War again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> and be|cau&s;e he apprehended, that tho&s;e Commotions of the Turks were de&s;igned to no other end,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Send For|ces again&s;t <HI>Ragotski.</HI></NOTE> than to engage him to renounce all a&s;&s;i&s;tance and &s;uccour to be given unto <HI>Ragotski.</HI></P>
<P>We have already recounted in what manner the Turks had e&s;pou&s;ed the Quarrel of <HI>Stephen Gabor,</HI> and re&s;olved to e&s;tabli&s;h him in the Prin|cipality of <HI>Tran&s;ylvania,</HI> with the Ruin of <HI>Ra|gotski;</HI> which now being de&s;igned to be done by open Force, &s;everal Troops were &s;ent to the Frontiers of <HI>Tran&s;ylvania;</HI> which &s;o alarmed the Hungarians, that they put them&s;elves on their Guard, and obliged the E&s;tates of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> and <HI>Hungary</HI> to contribute toward the Succour of the Tran&s;ylvanian Prince.</P>
<P>The Emperor remained long in &s;u&s;pen&s;e what cour&s;e to &s;teer, until at length the Per&s;wa&s;ions of the Confederate Princes, the &s;hame of aban|doning a Friend and an Ally for a Prey to the Turks, and the fear of di&s;plea&s;ing his Heredita|ry Dominions in <HI>Hungary,</HI> who con&s;idered <HI>Tran|&s;ylvania</HI> as the Bulwark of their Country, indu|ced him to promi&s;e &s;ecretly, and underhand, A&s;|&s;i&s;tance to <HI>Ragotski.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Turks them&s;elves, the Effects did not corre&s;pond with their Menaces: for though they had gathered an Army of twenty thou&s;and Men at <HI>Buda,</HI> they not only were di&s;appointed of their De&s;ign upon <HI>Newhau&s;el,</HI> but were open|ly repul&s;ed, and &s;hamefully expelled the Fron|tiers by the palatine of <HI>Hungary:</HI> And <HI>Ragotski</HI> being recruited by Succours from the Emperor, and by an Alliance with <HI>Poland,</HI> defied the For|ces of the Turk, and contemned the Reports of &s;ixty thou&s;and Men preparing to march a|gain&s;t him.</P>
<P>For indeed the Grand Signior had too great an Incumbrance on his Shoulders by the War in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> to attend unto a perfect and &s;tudied Re|venge again&s;t <HI>Ragotski;</HI> for <HI>Revan</HI> being reco|vered by the Per&s;ian, (as we have already de|clared) was a Matter of high Moment; and what di&s;tracted all his Coun&s;els, and weakened his Hopes.</P>
<P>When News came fir&s;t of the Siege of <HI>Revan,</HI> Orders were given to the Vizier to Be&s;iege <HI>Bag|dat,</HI> as a means to cau&s;e a diver&s;ion of Arms;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mutiny in the Turki&s;h Army.</NOTE> but the Souldiery entertaining an aver&s;ion to this Enterpri&s;e, unanimou&s;ly refu&s;ed to March, or to proceed farther than <HI>Erzrum. Jambolat Ogli,</HI> who commanded the Army before the the Arrival of the Vizier, had &s;trangled a Pa&s;ha, and taken his E&s;tate to &s;upply the Wants of the Army; and had likewi&s;e put to Death &s;everal Spahees and Jani&s;aries for Mutiny, and becau&s;e they had de|clared an unwillingne&s;s to this War. The Soul|diery prepared to addre&s;s them&s;elves to the Vi|zier for Ju&s;tice again&s;t the&s;e violent Proceed|ings: but he not willing to hear them, endea|voured to divert their Complaints, which cau&s;ed a greater Commotion and Storm than before. And though <HI>Jambolat</HI> pleaded hid Orders and po&s;itive Commi&s;&s;ion from the Grand Signior for what he had acted; yet that Allegation not being accepted by the Multitude as a ju&s;tifiable Plea, the Vizier was forced to con|de&s;cend to their De&s;ire, and &s;trangle <HI>Jambo|lat,</HI> as he had done the others, being the only Means to quiet and compo&s;e this Trouble of his Army.</P>
<P>But as after &s;ome great Storm, there is al|ways remaining for a while a &s;welling and fluctua|tion in the Waters, &s;o there &s;till remained on the Spirits of the Souldiery, Di&s;contents and unquietne&s;s of Mind: Wherefore the Vizier fearing le&s;t the Enemy taking advantage of the pre&s;ent Seditions, &s;hould charge them at a time of Di&s;order, he retired at a di&s;tance from them into the Plains of <HI>Erzrum:</HI> But he was not a|ble to continue long in tho&s;e Parts for want of Fuel, and of Wood and Planks to &s;ecure them again&s;t the Rains and Snow; for it being Win|ter, which is rigorous and cold in that Country, their Tents were not &s;ufficient proof to defend them again&s;t the Extremity of the Weather.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the Turki&s;h Army remained at this Place, advice came,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Van</HI> be&s;ie|ged by the Per&s;ians.</NOTE> that the Per&s;ians had Be|&s;ieged <HI>Van,</HI> which is a &s;trong Fortre&s;s &s;ituate on an inacce&s;&s;ible Rock, on the Frontiers of the Province of <HI>Diarbequir.</HI> And though the Per&s;i|ans were not able to take this Place, neither by Storm nor Famine, yet during this Siege, they made u&s;e of their time to ruin all the Country of <HI>Diarbequir,</HI> which they left &s;o de&s;olate, that the Turki&s;h Army could not quarter there, nor ex|tract the lea&s;t Provi&s;ion or Sub&s;i&s;tence from thence.</P>
<P>To all the&s;e Misfortunes a greater was added by the Treachery of a certain <HI>Curd,</HI> one who pretending to be ill-&s;atisfied with the Per&s;ian Par|ty, voluntarily offered him&s;elf to the Service of
<PB N="34" REF="20">the Turks; and having done them &s;ome little Services, by being their Guide through certain difficult Pa&s;&s;ages, he gained a confidence &s;o far with them, as that de&s;igning to &s;urpri&s;e a quar|ter of the Enemy, they committed them&s;elves to his Guidance and Conduct; who having brought them into a narrow Pa&s;&s;age,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fifteen thou&s;and Turks kil|led in an Ambu&s;h.</NOTE> where an Ambu&s;h of the Enemy lay, he then turned his Coat, and fought again&s;t the Turks, of whom 15000 were killed and taken in this Snare.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, all Matters of this War proceeded cro&s;s and unfortunate for the Turks; for be|&s;ides their unlucky Fights with the Enemy, their own Seditions in the Camp were greater Mi&s;|chiefs;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mutiny of the Soul|diers.</NOTE> for now enduring no longer the&s;e pun|gent Mi&s;eries, under the pretence of wanting Pay, they cut in pieces the Trea&s;urer of the Ar|my, two Aga's of the Spahees, and the Chaou&s;|ba&s;hee of the Jani&s;aries.</P>
<P>This News arriving at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> when <HI>Morat</HI> was afflicted with a grievous acce&s;&s;ion of the Gout, &s;erved to redouble his Pains; in which raving again&s;t the Conduct of his Officers, he immediately deprived the Vizier of his Charge, and ordained <HI>Biram</HI> Pa&s;ha, late Chimacam, to &s;ucceed him in his Employment.</P>
<P>The new Vizier immediately &s;et forth the Hor&s;es Tail,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A new Vi|zier &s;ent to the Army.</NOTE> which is a &s;ignal of departure, with &s;ound of Drums and Trumpets, making Corban, which is a di&s;tribution of Mutton to the Poor, in divers Places: His Retinue was &s;pee|dily equipped with &s;uch &s;umptuous Magnificence, that it looked rather like the Train of an Am|ba&s;&s;ador, which intended to make Peace, than to the Troops of a General, who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s was nothing but Blood and De&s;truction. And indeed Matters &s;eemed to be inclining that way, the Per|&s;ians having far advanced in this Negotiation; for they wi&s;ely pondering the immen&s;e Force of the Ottoman Empire, with which they were now contending, judged it the mo&s;t politick cour&s;e to make Peace, under the au&s;picious Planet of their good Fortune; for not knowing how long that might remain con&s;tant, they might, &s;o &s;oon as the Wheel turns on the other &s;ide, be forced to accept Terms of le&s;s Advantage than at pre|&s;ent they might promi&s;e to them&s;elves under their happy Stars.</P>
<P>Wherefore a Propo&s;ition being made of &s;end|ing an Amba&s;&s;ador to the Grand Signior,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Per&s;ian Amba&s;&s;ador &s;ent to the G.

The Grand Signior entertaining &s;ome real Incli|nations to Peace, laid a&s;ide &s;omething of his u|&s;ual Grandeur and State, giving the Amba&s;&s;ador Audience in a few days after his arrival; and as nothing molli&s;ies the hard Mettle of a Turk's Spirit, like a gentle Shower of Gold, and the emulgent &s;oftne&s;s of Rich Pre&s;ents; &s;o <HI>Morat</HI> under&s;tanding of Gifts with which he came ac|companied, afforded to the Amba&s;&s;ador an ea&s;y Ear and a plea&s;ing Countenance.</P>

<P>The&s;e Pre&s;ents &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed and prepared the Mind of the Grand Signior towards an Ac|commodation, that he be&s;towed a kind A&s;pect and gentle Words on the Amba&s;&s;ador, &s;o that all the World expected that a Peace would have en&s;ued.</P>
<P>And indeed one might well have believed his Reality in this Intention, &s;ince the ardent Pa&s;&s;ion he had to be revenged of <HI>Ragotski,</HI> availed more with him than all other Con&s;iderations in the World. His Honour al&s;o called him to give a &s;top to the Progre&s;s of the Mo&s;covites, who had taken <HI>A&s;ac;</HI> and the Tartars and Co&s;&s;acks gave &s;ome ground of Jealou&s;y, that before long they de&s;igned &s;ome Action on the Turki&s;h Territo|ries: the Rea&s;ons whereof we &s;hall di&s;cour&s;e in this following Year.</P>
<P>We have already related, &s;ome Years pa&s;t, on what Terms the Tartars &s;tood with the Turk, how they refu&s;ed to accept that King which the Port recommended to them, though the el|de&s;t and fir&s;t of the true Line: how they fought and overthrew the Forces which the Grand Sig|nior &s;ent to compel them to the Election he de|&s;ired; and this la&s;t Year, upon pretence of a War with <HI>Cantemir,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Troubles in the le&s;&s;er <HI>Tartary.</HI></NOTE> they refu&s;ed to &s;end their Army again&s;t the Per&s;ian, as had always been ac|cu&s;tomary to do again&s;t the Enemies of the Sultan, when&s;oever required.</P>
<P>The Pa&s;ha, Muftee, and Kadi of <HI>Caffa</HI> (which is the Grand Signior's Town in <HI>Tartary</HI>) urged the Tartar <HI>Han</HI> to prepare and forward his For|ces, according to the Duty and Obligation which was incumbent on him; and enlivening their Arguments with Reproaches of Cowardi&s;e and Ingratitude; &s;o far provoked the <HI>Han,</HI> that he cau&s;ed them all three to be &s;trangled.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this high Provocation, the Grand Signior di&s;&s;embled the Injury, le&s;t a due Re&s;entment &s;hould rai&s;e them into an open Re|bellion: and di&s;&s;embling an approbation of the Fact, as done with Rea&s;on and Ju&s;tice, &s;ent to the Tartar <HI>Han</HI> a Sword and a Ve&s;t, as Signals of his Favour: And farther &s;u&s;pecting, le&s;t in pro&s;ecution of &s;o &s;en&s;ible a Blow, the Tartar joining in League with the Co&s;&s;acks and Mo&s;co|vites, &s;hould make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of <HI>Caffa,</HI> he prudently touched the Wound with a gentle Hand, offering to ordain &s;uch a Pa&s;ha, as &s;hould be warranted with his A&s;&s;ent and Approbati|on.</P>
<P>The Tartar being overcome by &s;uch Lenitives as the&s;e, prote&s;ted that he never entertained other Thoughts, than to maintain his Faith and Alle|giance inviolable towards the Grand Signior; and that the Alliance he had made with the <HI>No|gay</HI> Tartars, and the Forces now rai&s;ed, were maintained with no other De&s;ign, than to &s;up|pre&s;s the Rebellion and In&s;olence of <HI>Cantemir.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Cantemir</HI> being a Per&s;on of a bold Spirit, and daring in all his Actions, did oftentimes, by virtue of his own Authority, lead a &s;trong Par|ty to the Field, being followed by the brave&s;t and &s;toute&s;t Souldiers of <HI>Tartary;</HI> for which Rea&s;on being hated by the Tartar <HI>Han,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cantemir</HI> makes a new Colony.</NOTE> and his Life often attempted, and his own Spirit not &s;upporting a Subjection to any other, he pa&s;&s;ed
<PB N="35" REF="20">the <HI>Nie&s;ter,</HI> and retired with his own Troops, and &s;uch others as would follow him, into the Country of <HI>Budziak,</HI> near to <HI>Beliegrod</HI> and <HI>Ki|lia,</HI> confining on the Frontiers of <HI>Moldavia;</HI> where he intended to plant and form a new Co|lony and Government.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time, divers chief Captains being de&s;irous to follow the En&s;igns of &s;o famous a Ge|neral, came in to him; and multitudes of Peo|ple for&s;aking the Sands and barren Rocks of <HI>Tartary,</HI> came crowding into this Country; that the Plains of <HI>Budziak</HI> not being capable to con|tain them, they pa&s;&s;ed into <HI>Moldavia;</HI> where in|croaching on the Lands of the proper Inhabi|tants, gave a Jealou&s;ie as if they intended to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole Province.</P>
<P>The Poles being jealous of the&s;e ill Neigh|bours, which lay at the Gate of their Country, ready to enter on all occa&s;ions, had made Provi|&s;ion in their la&s;t Articles of Peace with the Grand Signior, that he &s;hould force them to return, and urged that point by the Amba&s;&s;ador with all earne&s;tne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Tartar <HI>Han</HI> al&s;o finding his Countries depopulated and weakened by &s;o large an Eva|cuation, made al&s;o his Complaints and Addre&s;&s;es to the Port. But the Grand Signior looking on this Colony, as an increa&s;e of his Dominions, and to be compo&s;ed of &s;uch People whom Ne|ce&s;&s;ity mu&s;t render obedient; and that they could ea&s;ily, at his Command, make Irruptions into <HI>Poland, Hungary,</HI> and <HI>Tran&s;ylvania,</HI> &s;eemed deaf to all Applications in this Bu&s;ine&s;s; and as if they were a People in whom he had no part, &s;hewed no concernment for them, though &s;ecret|ly he promi&s;ed them his Protection.</P>
<P>Hereupon <HI>&V;ladi&s;laus</HI> King of <HI>Poland,</HI> being wearied with Delays, re&s;olved by force of Arms, to drive out this dete&s;tible Neighbour|hood: But the Tartar <HI>Han,</HI> whom this Bu&s;ine&s;s more nearly concerned, being more &s;peedy in execution than the Poles, having rai&s;ed an Army of thirty thou&s;and Men, encountred <HI>Cantemir</HI> with twenty thou&s;and,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is over|thrown by the Tartar <HI>Han.</HI></NOTE> and charged him &s;o fu|riou&s;ly, that he killed &s;even thou&s;and of them on the Place, and put the re&s;t to flight, pur&s;uing them through the Plains of <HI>Dobruc</HI> on the other &s;ide of the <HI>Danube.</HI></P>
<P>The Grand Signior, who had all this Time re|mained a Spectator of this Succe&s;s, began now to take the part of <HI>Cantemir,</HI> and &s;everely to reprove the Proceedings of the Tartar <HI>Han,</HI> for having di&s;turbed <HI>Cantemir,</HI> whil&s;t he was pre|paring to &s;erve him in the Wars of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> But the Tartar, having &s;haken off much of his Re|&s;pect and Reverence towards the Grand Signior, de&s;pi&s;ed the Menaces which he vented again&s;t him, and proceeded in his own Bu&s;ine&s;s, com|pelling his People to return again to their Coun|try, and to their Ancient Habitations. <HI>Morat</HI> being forced to &s;uffer what he could not remedy, &s;ummoned <HI>Cantemir,</HI> with all diligence, to ren|der him&s;elf at <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> where being arri|ved, he was at fir&s;t regarded with a favourable Eye; but his Son &s;oon after having in a private Quarrel killed a Tartar near the Walls of the Seraglio, was for that Fact ju&s;tly &s;trangled by Order of the Grand Signior; the day fol|lowing, <HI>Cantemir</HI> was al&s;o impri&s;oned,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cantemir</HI> put to death.</NOTE> and in a &s;hort time underwent the like Fate with that of his Son.</P>
<P>During the&s;e Troubles, a Nephew of <HI>Can|temir</HI> feigning him&s;elf to be di&s;gu&s;ted with his Uncle, revolted to the Party of the Tartar <HI>Han,</HI> with no other than a treacherous De&s;ign to take away the Lives of the two Brothers; the which he compa&s;&s;ed at a time of their hunting, when being far remote from their Attendance, following their Game in untroden Paths, he &s;et upon them with an hundred Villains,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of <HI>Tartary</HI> killed.</NOTE> and perfi|dioufly took away their Lives. The News here|of was highly applauded at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and the Traitor extolled as a Per&s;on of mighty Cou|rage and wonderful Ingenuity; &s;o that now dif|ferent Coun&s;els, and new Mea&s;ures, were taken concerning the Affairs in <HI>Tartary.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bechir Gherry,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bechir Gherey</HI> or|dained K. of <HI>Tartary.</HI></NOTE> Brother to tho&s;e Princes of <HI>Tartary</HI> which were killed, was then at <HI>Jamboli,</HI> a City in <HI>Thrace,</HI> retired thither under the Pro|tection of the Grand Signior, for fear and jea|lou&s;ie of Treachery from his elder. Brother. <HI>Mo|rat</HI> cau&s;ed him to be brought to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> where he was &s;umptuou&s;ly received, and con|ducted to Audience by the Chimacam, who gave him the upper-hand, which is the Left among&s;t Men of the Sword, as the Right is a|mong&s;t Men of Learning or of the Pen; for as the right Hand governs the latter, &s;o the fir&s;t is appendent to the left Side.</P>
<P>The Bodies of the two dead Brothers were brought to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> where fetulent or &s;tink|ing, they were expo&s;ed to the &s;ight of <HI>Morat;</HI> who to gratify his own Humour of Revenge, cau&s;ed them to be thrown into the Sea.</P>
<P>This good News from <HI>Tartary,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A&s;ac</HI> be|&s;ieged.</NOTE> was attem|pered with a wor&s;e from <HI>A&s;ac,</HI> which the Mo&s;|covites and Co&s;&s;acks had be&s;ieged. This Town is &s;ituated at the Mouth of the River <HI>Tanais,</HI> up|on the declining of a Hill; it is in form four|&s;quare, and may be about twelve hundred Paces in Compa&s;s. Before it fell into the Hands of the Turks, it was a famous Scale for all &s;orts of Merchandi&s;e, e&s;pecially for Butter, Chee&s;e, &s;alt Fi&s;h, Leather, Slaves, and other Commodities brought hither by Turks, Tartars, and Mo&s;co|vites. The Venetians when they addicted them|&s;elves more to Traffick and Commerce than they do at pre&s;ent, took this Scale for their Way into <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> The Town was fortified with ancient Walls, flanked with capacious Towers, and with a Ca&s;tle which being in the middle, and on the &s;ide of the Water, divides the Town, as it were, into two equal parts. The Gari&s;on con|&s;i&s;ted not of above three or four hundred Men; for being a place remote from powerful Enemies, it fell not under any great jealou&s;ie, now was it deemed worthy of the Charge of numerous De|fendats.</P>
<P>The City being in this weak Condition, the Co&s;&s;acks &s;oon made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of it;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is taken by the Co&s;&s;aks.</NOTE> which after they had &s;acked and pillaged to the utmo&s;t, they con&s;idered it as a place worthy of better Fortifications; and therefore applying them&s;elves to rai&s;e new Works, and repair the Old, they &s;oon made it a Fortre&s;s of Strength and Con&s;ideration. This happening at a time when the Turks were diverted by the Per&s;ian War, the Co&s;&s;acks injoyed this new Conque&s;t for the &s;pace of four Years without mole&s;tation, until that in the Year 1641, it was recovered with much Blood and Slaughter by the Arms of Sultan <HI>Ibrahim,</HI> as we &s;hall hereafter recount in the &s;equel of this Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>And now becau&s;e the taking of this Place was the Original from whence the Divi&s;ions and Civil Wars between the Poles and Co&s;&s;acks de|rived their beginning, and was the Occa&s;ion that the Co&s;&s;acks revolted from their ju&s;t Obe|dience, to the Protection of the Turks; the Relation will not only be curious, but a di|gre&s;&s;ion nece&s;&s;ary to the clearer Light of the pre&s;ent Hi&s;tory.</P>

<P>At pre&s;ent the name of Co&s;&s;acks, and their Coun|try al&s;o, is of a far greater extent than it was formerly; for they call now all &s;uch in <HI>Poland</HI> Co&s;&s;acks, that are light Hor&s;e armed with Bow and Arrow and Fire-arms: and their Country &s;ince the late Commotions is mea&s;ured from the farthe&s;t parts of the Palatinate of <HI>Chiovia,</HI> for the &s;pace of and hundred and twenty Leagues on one &s;ide, and the other of the <HI>Bori&s;thenes,</HI> which comprehends likewi&s;e all the Country of <HI>&V;kra|nia.</HI> This Country was always inhabited by the mo&s;t Warlike People of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia;</HI> for that being &s;ubject to the frequent Incur&s;ions of the Tartars, nece&s;&s;ary Defence, and con&s;tant practice in Arms, endued them with a Bold and Martial Spirit.</P>
<P><HI>&V;krania</HI> is a Country &s;o fertile, that it may compare with the mo&s;t fruitful Soil in the World, producing &s;uch quantities of Corn, with little labour, that the Husband-men being made neg|ligent by their abundance, produced with little Toil, have lei&s;ure to apply them&s;elves to Vio|lence and Rapine. They have no Wine, but u&s;e them&s;elves much to Strong-waters. Their Hou&s;es are not built of Wood or Stone, but of O&s;iers, interwoven and daubed over with Earth and Lime; &s;o that they u&s;e no Nails or Iron: they have no Merchants unle&s;s in <HI>Kiow;</HI> nor do they &s;erve them&s;elves of Phy&s;icians or Apotheca|ries. Their learned Language, or the Tongue wherein they write, is the Sclavonian, anciently called the Illyrian: &s;o that in all things this Peo|ple is rude and barbarous; and though their manner of Government and Policy is not refined or methodically di&s;po&s;ed, yet neverthele&s;s it is &s;olid and of deep Foundation, appropriated to the nature and di&s;po&s;ition of that People.</P>
<P>This hone&s;t De&s;ign of King <HI>&V;ladi&s;laus,</HI> to re|duce this People to a ju&s;t and an indu&s;trious cour&s;e of living, not agreeing with their Temper and Cu&s;toms, they rather re&s;olved to leave their Country, and betake them&s;elves to various For|tunes; &s;ome of them pa&s;&s;ed into <HI>Mo&s;covia</HI> to plant a Colony in tho&s;e uninhabited Parts: a Bo|dy of them, to the number of &s;ix thou&s;and, join|ing together, re&s;olved to pa&s;s into <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> to offer their &s;ervice unto that King; and being on their Journey, as far as the <HI>Tanais,</HI> they encountred with a Party of Mo&s;covite Co&s;&s;acks, who inha|bited certain I&s;lands of that River; with whom entertaining Di&s;cour&s;e, they under&s;tood that <HI>A&s;ac</HI> might ea&s;ily be &s;urpri&s;ed by them, if they could agree to unite Forces, which together might compo&s;e a Body of ten thou&s;and Men: The Importance of the Place being well con&s;ide|red, it was re&s;olved, that the March into <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> &s;hould be &s;hortned, and this City be ordained for the ultimate End of their Travels and Place of Repo&s;e. According to this coun&s;el <HI>A&s;ac</HI> be|ing a&s;&s;aulted and taken, (as we have already in|timated) the Co&s;&s;acks fortified it in the be&s;t manner that they were able, making an Ar|&s;enal for their Boats and Saicks, whereby af|terwards they did much more infe&s;t the Turks than before.</P>
<P>The other Co&s;&s;acks who continued in their Country, being much per&s;ecuted by the Poli&s;h Nobility, cho&s;e <HI>Kilminie&s;chi</HI> for their General, (the Son of a Noble Family in <HI>Lituania,</HI> but ba|ni&s;hed and degraded of his Honour for his Cri|minal Offences) and rebelled again&s;t the Go|vernment. At fir&s;t not being able to re&s;i&s;t the Force of <HI>Poland,</HI> they retired within the Woods; but joining afterwards with other Co&s;&s;acks, they i&s;&s;ued forth at the beginning of the Spring, beat the Poles, and carried away a con&s;iderable Boo|ty. Afterwards joining with the Tartars, they made their Incur&s;ions as far as <HI>Zamo&s;ca,</HI> within twenty Leagues of <HI>War&s;aw;</HI> and &s;o Matters con|tinued with various Succe&s;&s;es not appertaining to this Hi&s;tory. Only thus far it is pertinent to the Matter di&s;cu&s;&s;ed for us to have &s;hewn, That the Coun&s;els of <HI>Poland</HI> were in a great Error, when they re&s;olved to change the Life, and alter the Humour of this Warlike People, which being protected in their Priviledges, and encouraged in their Wars, would at all Times, as occa&s;ion &s;erved, have been ready to have ejected great numbers of good Souldiers into the Ottoman Territories, and might &s;till have been con&s;er|ved to ballance the Power of the Tartars, which now daily infe&s;t and ruin the Borders of <HI>Po|land.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e People were like Ill Humors, which being vomited out into the Dominions of the Turk, ea&s;ed and made healthy the Body Politick of <HI>Poland;</HI> but being con&s;erved within the Sto|mach, cau&s;ed Syncopes, Convul&s;ions, and &s;uch Commotions, as have of late Years &s;haken the whole Body of the Poli&s;h Kingdom: and at length withdrawing them&s;elves entirely from all Obedience, together with that large Pro|vince of <HI>&V;krania,</HI> as they have weakned that

<P>When the News arrived fir&s;t at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> that <HI>A&s;ac</HI> was be&s;ieged, the Captain-Pa&s;ha going then to in&s;tate <HI>Bechir</HI> into his Kingdom of <HI>Tar|tary,</HI> received Orders to relieve <HI>A&s;ac,</HI> and if po&s;&s;ible, to rai&s;e the Siege; but the Succours coming too late, and the Town being taken, the lo&s;s thereof was not e&s;teemed important enough to divert either Thoughts or Forces from the Per|&s;ian War.</P>
<P>For now <HI>Morat</HI> re&s;olving to pre&s;ecute the War in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Preparati|ons for the War in <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></NOTE> which could not be &s;ucce&s;sful without the united Power of his whole Empire, con|ducted by his own Per&s;on, he re&s;olved to make a &s;econd Journey into tho&s;e Parts, and with his own Hand to knock at the Gates of <HI>Babylon.</HI> To prepare and di&s;po&s;e all matters in order here|unto, he in the fir&s;t place countermanded his De|cree, which prohibited a farther increa&s;e of the number of Jani&s;aries; for now being de&s;irous to augment his Army beyond the account of an|cient Regi&s;ters, he opened the Jani&s;aries Door, (as they call it) and enrolled &s;ix thou&s;and more into that Order.</P>
<P>To con&s;erve &s;till the Order of this Militia, he appointed Officers &s;trictly and &s;everely to take the Decimation of the Chri&s;tian Children in <HI>Europe,</HI> and le&s;t (as was u&s;ual) they &s;hould be corrupted by the Parents, who often give Pre|&s;ents, whereby to blind the Eyes of the Mini|&s;ters, that &s;o they may over&s;ee their Children, or in lieu of the comlie&s;t and mo&s;t fit for Service, accept of the Sickly and Impotent, or &s;uch as are unworthy of the Bread and Education given them by the Sultan, he mo&s;t &s;everely injoined this Service, and under a thou&s;and Menaces en|charged the care hereof to be executed without Favour or Partiality to any. He carefully re|viewed the Books of the Timjar-Spahees, count|ting the number exactly that every Country yields, and comparing them with tho&s;e mu&s;tered in the Field, he confi&s;cated the Lands of tho&s;e that wanted, being forfeited for non-appear|ance: he would admit of no Excu&s;e or Delay to the Matter in hand. The Superintendant of the Ordnance but making a Scruple about the Proportion of &s;ome Guns, as too weighty and unwieldy for &s;o long a March, lo&s;t his Life, for doubting or making a difficulty in what the Grand Signior propo&s;ed or de&s;igned.</P>
<P>And that no Commotions at home might di|vert or call him back before his Bu&s;ine&s;s was per|fected, he encharged his Pa&s;ha's of the Fronti|ers to live quietly with their Neighbours, and to be &s;ure to give no occa&s;ions of Complaint, or Cau&s;e for War during his ab&s;ence; recommend|ing to the prudence of the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Sili&s;tria</HI> the care of compo&s;ing certain Differences between the Princes of <HI>Moldavia</HI> and <HI>Walachia.</HI></P>
<P>Having &s;ecured Matters as well as he could at home, he ordered the Hor&s;e-tail to be &s;et forth at the gate of the Divan, and all Pa&s;ha's and Officers of the Army did the like at their own Doors. His Troops began now to grow nume|rous; the Spahees and Timariots appointed for the Guard of the Grand Signior's Tents, toge|ther with other Cavalry, which hold their Lands under Service, amounted unto two hundred thou&s;and. From the hundred &s;eventy two Chambers of Jani&s;aries he drew forth thirty thou&s;and. From the Topgees or Gunners, whereof there are no more than twelve hundred in their Chambers at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> yet make up twelve thou&s;and in other parts, he drew out three thou&s;and for the pre&s;ent Service. The Shepherds and Plough-men of <HI>Bulgaria</HI> made up twenty thou&s;and; which with Water-bearers, Smiths, Bakers, Butchers, and all other Trade&s;|men which followed the Camp, were in va&s;t Numbers: &s;o that the whole Army, with the At|tendants belonging thereunto, were at a mode|rate calculation computed to amount unto near five hundred thou&s;and Men; whereof three hundred thou&s;and were fighting Men.</P>
<P>The Pe&s;tilence, which is the Epidemical Di&s;|ea&s;e of <HI>Turkie,</HI> and which abates the Numbers and Pride of that People, raged this Year great|ly in <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and in the parts of <HI>Romag|nia;</HI> it entred into the Seraglio, and among&s;t others, took away the only Son of the Grand Signior of two or three Years old. This cau&s;ed <HI>Morat</HI> to pa&s;s mo&s;t part of the Summer at a Pa|lace on the <HI>Bo&s;phorus,</HI> where he recreated him|&s;elf with his drunken Companion the Per&s;ian Traitor; and hereby he contradicted the Pro|verb, <HI>That Princes love the Trea&s;on, but not the Traitor;</HI> for <HI>Morat</HI> it &s;eems loved them both, entertaining this Fellow in his Bo&s;om: His Cloaths, his Garb, his Hor&s;es, and Equipage, might rival with that of the Sultan's; He took place of the Chimacam in all Publick Appear|ances; and what was mo&s;t &s;trange, he preceded the Mufti; which was a new Form never before practi&s;ed, and would have afforded matter of Wonder and Di&s;cour&s;e, but that the World con&s;idered this Novelty, as a Method agreeable to the extravagant Humor of the Sultan.</P>
<P>Among&s;t his Pa&s;times, nothing was more plea|&s;ing than &s;ome Diverti&s;ement acted with Blood; he &s;hot the Son of a Pa&s;ha with his Gun, for daring to approach near the Walls of his Serag|lio, &s;uppo&s;ing that he came with curio&s;ity to di&s;cover his Plea&s;ures,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The extra|vagant Plea&s;ures and Cruel|ties of <HI>Mo|rat.</HI></NOTE> and manner of voluptu|ous Recreations: For the &s;ame Rea&s;on he would have &s;unk a Boat laden with Women, as it glided &s;lowly by the Banks of the Garden. He would him&s;elf behold two Thieves impailed, which were condemned to die for robbing &s;ome|thing out of his Seraglio. He commanded the Head of the Trea&s;urer of <HI>Cyprus</HI> to be cut off in his pre&s;ence; as al&s;o the Ma&s;ter of his Mu&s;ick, for daring to &s;ing a certain Air which &s;eemed Per&s;ian, and to prai&s;e the Valour of that Na|tion. The Pa&s;ha of <HI>Temi&s;war</HI> he put to Death at a full Divan, for fighting unfortunately again&s;t <HI>Ragotski.</HI></P>
<P>To the&s;e &s;evere Acts of Cruelty, which he called Ju&s;tice, he added one not unplea&s;ant; A certain Greek called <HI>Stridia Bei,</HI> or Lord <HI>Oy|&s;ters,</HI> who had been Prince of <HI>Walachia,</HI> and one whom we have before mentioned, having, by his oppre&s;&s;ion and hara&s;&s;ing that People, ama&s;&s;ed a con&s;iderable Sum of Mony, e&s;&s;ayed a &s;econd time, by force thereof, to obtain the Principa|lity; and making his Offer and Reque&s;t before the Grand Signior, he was heard with &s;ome railery: At length the Grand Signior told him, That he was too proud and a&s;piring, and there|fore ordered the tips of his No&s;e and Ears to be cut off, telling him, that that was to clip the Wings of his Ambition.</P>
<P>But that before his departure for <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> he might con&s;ummate his Acts of Tyranny, he pra|cti&s;ed one upon his Brother, a Youth of Twenty two Years of Age, of great Hopes, and good Endowments. He was conducted to the pre|&s;ence of his Brother, at the Biram, to pay his Re&s;pects, as is u&s;ual at that Fe&s;tival; and having performed the Ceremony, he enlarged him&s;elf in high Prai&s;es and Admiration of the Grand
<PB N="38" REF="22">Signior's Genero&s;ity and Bravery; who for re|covery of <HI>Bagdat,</HI> was contented to expo&s;e his Per&s;on to the Inconveniences of a long Journey, and the Dangers of a hazardous War, and that therein he equalled, if not &s;urpa&s;&s;ed, the Glory of his Ance&s;tors: Which courtly and rational manner of Di&s;cour&s;e did not plea&s;e <HI>Morat,</HI> but rather admini&s;tred Subject of Jealou&s;y, fearing that he knew too much; and that as he could Speak well, &s;o he might Act accordingly; wherefore the &s;ame Day he cau&s;ed him to be &s;trangled, to the great Sorrow of the People, and dete&s;tation of his Abominable Tyranny: But to amu&s;e the Minds of the Multitude, and cea&s;e their Murmurings, he cau&s;ed it to be di|vulged abroad; that fourteen of his Women in the Seraglio were with Child: which was all fal&s;e, there remaining none of the Ottoman Race be&s;ides his Brother Sultan <HI>Ibrahim,</HI> who was Weak, as well in Body as Under&s;tanding, and who&s;e Imperfections &s;ecured and compound|ed for his Life: And to &s;uppre&s;s the Di&s;cour&s;e about his Brother's Murder, he changed it into a talk about his Preparations for War, and his departure for <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> Wherefore the Fore|runners and Harbingers of the Army being &s;ent away with Labourers to repair Bridges, and to level the Ways for the more ea&s;ie pa&s;&s;age of the Cannon. <HI>Morat</HI> pa&s;&s;ed over to his Tents at <HI>Scutari,</HI> cloathed in a Coat of Mail, and with a Head-piece &s;et with Precious Stones, and his Sar|gouch or Feathers cla&s;ped to it with Buckles of Diamonds.</P>
<P>As he landed at <HI>Scutari,</HI> he was received by three Squadrons of Souldiers, each Squadron con&s;i&s;ting of four thou&s;and Men well Armed, and richly Attired; the Garments of one Squa|dron of which were provided at the Expence of the Grand Signior, and of the other two at the Charge of his Favourite, and of the Captain-Pa&s;ha: the latter of which pre&s;ented to the Grand Signior thirty Pur&s;es of Mony, for be|&s;towing on him the Honour to command that Gally which tran&s;ported him to the A&s;ian Coa&s;t. The Amba&s;&s;ador &s;ent from <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> was detained at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> until this time, and after the Turki&s;h Fa&s;hion not permitted to depart at his own liberty; but being now ordered to follow the Camp, his Port and Quarters were a&s;&s;igned, that &s;o he might be a Spectator of that Tragedy which was now to be acted. All things were now di&s;po&s;ed in good Po&s;ture, with much So|lemnity, in order to a March; the Conacks, or days Journies, with their Places of Quarters, were laid out in an hundred and twenty days of March from <HI>Scutary</HI> to <HI>Babylon,</HI> and &s;eventy days of Otorack or Repo&s;e. The Journies with the gro&s;s Body of &s;uch an Army could not be long; and the joyning with other Forces in the way, required lei&s;ure and time.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the Hor&s;e, after the Turki&s;h man|ner, having eaten their Gra&s;s and been &s;oiled, this powerful Army decamped from <HI>Scutari</HI> a|bout the end of <HI>May.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The March of the Tur|ki&s;h Army.</NOTE> The fir&s;t day of Oto|rack or Repo&s;e was appointed at <HI>I&s;mit,</HI> where the Grand Signior made a review of his Army; &s;uch as were Aged, and unable to endure the Fatigues of a long March, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, giving them half Pay for their Lives, with the Name of Otoracks, which is the &s;ame with <HI>Milites E|meriti</HI> among the Romans: with exact Order therefore and &s;evere Di&s;cipline, to which their fierce Monarch had reduced them, marched this numerous Army; no Villages were abu&s;ed, nor Country-people plundred, and all things were purcha&s;ed with ready Mony: And the Grand Signior him&s;elf being rendred more gentle and tractable in the Field than in his Seraglio, heard all Complaints, and di&s;tributed Ju&s;tice with an equal and impartial Hand.</P>
<P>In the mean time, at <HI>Cou&s;tantinople,</HI> due care was taken to keep things Quiet and in Order; the Bo&s;tangiba&s;hee, like Lord High Chamberlain, had the Charge committed to him of the Seraglio, and the Moveables of it; he frequently made his Rounds both by Sea and Land, puni&s;hed tho&s;e whom he found in Taverns; nor would he &s;uf|fer any Candles to be lighted after two hours in the Night. The Chimacam, and the Captain-Pa&s;ha, likewi&s;e executed their Offices with all care and &s;everity in their re&s;pective Stations.</P>
<P>At this time, to the great di&s;&s;atisfaction of the Greek Nation, <HI>Cyril</HI> the Patriarch,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cyrillus</HI> the Patriarch &s;trangled.</NOTE> who had been in <HI>England,</HI> and greatly affected with the Di&s;cipline of our Church, was depo&s;ed, impri|&s;oned in the Seven Towers, and &s;trangled: in his place one <HI>Carfila</HI> was ordained Patriarch, and his Commi&s;&s;ion or Baratz obtained from the Grand Signior at the expence of fifty thou&s;and Crowns, one Moity whereof was paid from <HI>Rome,</HI> the whole De&s;ign again&s;t <HI>Cyrillus</HI> being managed by the Je&s;uits and other Religious living at <HI>Galata,</HI> who accu&s;ed him before the Turks, of keeping a &s;ecret Corre&s;pondence with the Mo&s;covites and Co&s;&s;acks; for which lo&s;ing his Life <HI>Carfila,</HI> a pretended Friend to the Roman Faction, was in&s;tituted Patriarch.</P>
<P>The Grand Signior marching with his potent and numerous Army, all the World remained at a gaze what the I&s;&s;ue &s;hould be of this mighty Enterpri&s;e; yet mo&s;t were of Opinion, that the Honour and Riches of the Ottoman Empire be|ing now at Stake, the War could not otherwi&s;e conclude than with the Conque&s;t of <HI>Babylon.</HI> All that could be feared, was &s;ome diver&s;ion by the Chri&s;tian Princes; who taking hold of the pre|&s;ent Conjuncture, &s;hould enter the Frontiers with a powerful Army, and thereby force the Sultan to return. But as to <HI>Poland,</HI> the Jea|lou&s;y &s;oon vani&s;hed. When the News came of a Civil War between the Poles and the Co&s;&s;acks, and that ten thou&s;and of the latter were &s;lain in a Battel, this Intelligence came mo&s;t &s;ea&s;onable and grateful to the Port, expecting now a Me&s;|&s;age from the Co&s;&s;acks, de&s;iring Succour in their Extremity; for &s;uch Accidente as the&s;e have nou|ri&s;hed the Turki&s;h Intere&s;t, which hath grown out of the Civil Di&s;cords of Chri&s;tian Prin|ces.</P>
<P>By this means, as the Apprehen&s;ions of War by Land cea&s;ed, &s;o there appeared &s;ome Clouds of Storm at Sea; which doubtle&s;s might have produced a War with <HI>Venice,</HI> and the Turks been at lei&s;ure to attend it; for &s;ixteen Gallies belonging to <HI>Algier, Tunis,</HI> and <HI>Bi&s;erta,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pirats of <HI>Algier</HI> and <HI>Tunis</HI> infe&s;t the Gulf of <HI>Venice.</HI></NOTE> well armed with Slaves and Souldiers, and provided &s;ufficiently with Cannon, Powder, and Bullet, Commanded by <HI>Ali Picenin,</HI> united together and formed a &s;mall Fleet, with de&s;ign to rove over the Adriatick Sea, and infe&s;t the Coa&s;t of <HI>Italy.</HI> Their Intentions were to plunder the Riches of <HI>Loretto;</HI> but being hindred by contrary Winds, from entring &s;o high into the Gulf, they made a de&s;cent in <HI>Puglia,</HI> and &s;acked all the Country of <HI>Nicotra,</HI> carrying away a great Booty, with Slaves, and among&s;t them &s;everal Nuns which they pro&s;tituted to their Lu&s;t; thence they pa&s;|&s;ed over to the &s;ide of <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> and in &s;ight of <HI>Cataro</HI> took a Ve&s;&s;el, and made Prize of all Ships which they met in tho&s;e Seas; the Rumor of which made great noi&s;e over all <HI>Italy,</HI> the People exclaiming again&s;t their Princes for &s;uf|fering
<PB N="39" REF="22">their Lives and E&s;tates to remain &s;ubject to the petty Force of a few Pirats. For the Ve&s;|&s;els of <HI>Malta</HI> and <HI>Florence</HI> were disjoined, and roving after purcha&s;e in the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> took little notice of what was acted in the Gulf. The Spaniards, after their fa&s;hion, were &s;low in Arming, and &s;pent the Summer in Preparations, till the Pirats, laden with Booty, were depar|ted towards the Winter; &s;o that none remain|ed to take care of <HI>Italy,</HI> and the Venetian Gulf, but <HI>Venice</HI> only, to whom the Dominion of tho&s;e Seas are rightly appropriated.</P>
<P>To &s;uppre&s;s therefore the In&s;olence of the&s;e Pirats, the Republick &s;et forth a Fleet con&s;i&s;ting of twenty eight Gallies and two Gallea&s;&s;es, un|der the Command of <HI>Marin Capello,</HI> with In|&s;tructions to &s;ink, burn, and de&s;troy tho&s;e Pi|rats, either in the open Seas, or in Harbour of the Turks; for that by the Articles of Peace, between the Grand Signior and the Venetians, it was agreed, That no Port or Harbour of his &s;hould be priviledged to afford entertainment or protection to any Free-booter or Pirat of that nature.</P>
<P>It happened about that time, that the Malte&s;es and Florentines cru&s;ing in the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> had done great Mi&s;chief to the Turks in tho&s;e Seas; to revenge which, and to prevent farther da|mage, the Captain-Pa&s;ha &s;ent Orders to the&s;e Ve&s;&s;els of <HI>Barbary</HI> immediately to come to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance; to which they were now more ea|&s;ily per&s;waded; for being already laden with Booty and Spoils, they contented them&s;elves with a change of their Station. But to give a fare|wel to tho&s;e Parts, they fir&s;t re&s;olved to &s;poil, and plunder <HI>Li&s;&s;a,</HI> ali&agrave;s <HI>Le&s;ina,</HI> an I&s;land belong|ing to the Republick; but being overtaken by the Venetian Fleet in their Voyage thither, near to <HI>Valona,</HI> a Port and Harbour belonging to the Turks, they put them&s;elves under the Defence of the Town and Ca&s;tle, which received them willingly to their Protection, notwith&s;tanding all Articles and Agreements to the contrary. The Venetian Fleet &s;aluted the Ca&s;tle without a Shot,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Capello</HI> blocks up the Pirats in <HI>Valona.</HI></NOTE> de&s;iring, that according to the Capitula|tions of Peace, the Pirats might be rejected, and commanded to abandon their Port: in an&s;wer hereunto the Turks replied with a Shot, making known their Intentions to defend their Friends: wherefore the Venetians retiring at &s;ome di|&s;tance came to an Anchor, de&s;igning to block up the Port. Many days had not pa&s;&s;ed before the Pirats endeavoured, by help of their Oars, and a gentle Gale, to make their e&s;cape; and being, with the gray of the Morning, advanced with|out the Port, they were e&s;pyed by the watch|ful Venetians, who dividing their Fleet into two Squadrons, charged them with high Courage; the Fight continued for the &s;pace of two hours, during all which time the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Valona</HI> fired at the Venetians, and &s;hot down a Ma&s;t of one of the Gallea&s;es, a Splinter of which wounded <HI>Lorenzo Marcello</HI> the Commander; at length five of the Gallies of the Pirats being di&s;abled, any many of their People killed, they began to fly, and retire again under the Protection of the Town; as al&s;o did the Venetians to their Place of Anchorage.</P>
<P>A di&s;tinct Advice of all Particulars being di&s;|patched to <HI>Venice,</HI> the Senate wrote to <HI>Capello,</HI> That &s;ince the re&s;pect which the Republick owes to the Ottoman Court was not unknown to him, he &s;hould by no means make any attempt again&s;t tho&s;e Pirats upon the Land, but meeting them fairly at Sea, he ought then to make u&s;e of all the valour and force he was able.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Duke of <HI>Medina las Tor|res,</HI> Vice-King of <HI>Naples,</HI> di&s;patched an Ex|pre&s;s to <HI>Capello,</HI> with Letters applauding the ge|nero&s;ity of the De&s;ign, wherein he was now en|gaged for the Glory of his Republick, and the Common Good of all Chri&s;tendom, proffering to &s;upply him with Refre&s;hments and Ammunition, and what el&s;e might &s;upply his Occa&s;ions; ex|pecting, that by &s;uch Encouragement as this, he might be induced to A&s;&s;ault the Enemies in <HI>Valona,</HI> without re&s;pect to the Grand Signior, or any Inconveniences which might ari&s;e thereby. On the contrary the Governour of the Ca&s;tle, and Kadi of the Town wrote a Letter to <HI>Ca|pello,</HI> putting him in mind, that he was within the Grand Signior's Dominions, and that he &s;hould be careful how he offered any Violence to tho&s;e Places, which would certainly prove a Violation of the Peace, and be the Original of an inevitable War.</P>
<P><HI>Capello</HI> had now lain a whole Month before the Port, having all the time injoied fair Weather, and a &s;mooth Sea, again&s;t the hope and de&s;ire of the Turks, who expected that by means of &s;ome Storm, the Enemy would be forced to re|move their Quarters to &s;ome &s;ecure Harbour, and thereby afford them an opportunity to e&s;cape.<NOTE PLACE="marg">He a&s;&s;aults them in the Port.</NOTE> But <HI>Capello</HI> growing weary of &s;uch te|dious Attendance, re&s;olved to expect no longer, nor yet to lo&s;e the pre&s;ent Advantage of ren|dring him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of the Ve&s;&s;els of the Ene|my: wherefore dividing his Fleet into &s;everal Squadrons, he advanced near the Port, firing &s;e|veral Shot at the Tents of the Pirats, of which one from a Galea&s;s &s;truck a Mo&s;ch; and arming with &s;tore of Men the Galeots and Bri|gantines, they entred the Port, and to the a&s;to|ni&s;hment and vexation of the Turks, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the &s;ixteen Ve&s;&s;els, and brought them to their Admiral: which though they had disfurni&s;hed of all their chief Booty, yet their Cannon and Arms remained, of which there were twelve Pieces of great Bra&s;s Guns, be&s;ides others of Iron, with divers Falcons and le&s;&s;er Arms.</P>
<P>The Intelligence hereof being carried to <HI>Ve|nice,</HI> Orders were given, that all the Ve&s;&s;els &s;hould be &s;unk in the Port of <HI>Corfu,</HI> excepting only the Admiral of <HI>Algier,</HI> which was to be brought to the Ar&s;enal of <HI>Venice,</HI> there to remain as a Trophy of Victory, and for a perpetual Memory of this Glorious Atchievement. How|&s;oever this Exploit was variou&s;ly interpreted at <HI>Venice,</HI> and approved, or di&s;proved, according to the diver&s;ity of Humors. The younger Men applauded it as an Action of great Gallantry, excu&s;ing his Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the Senats Orders by a tran&s;port of Pa&s;&s;ion and Zeal towards his Country, and de&s;ire of Glory. But the Sena|tors, and Men of mature Judgments, highly re|&s;ented this Breach of their Orders, which as they are &s;trictly Enjoined, &s;o they expected that they &s;hould be punctually Obeyed. That this action was a &s;ufficient and Ju&s;t Cau&s;e alone to kindle a War, and that it was a matter intolera|ble, that a &s;ingle Citizen &s;hould of his own Head and Humor, pre&s;ume to act &s;uch things, as mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily involve the Publick in a War, contrary to their Plea&s;ure, and in oppo&s;ition to their expre&s;s Commands. For which Crime and other &s;ub&s;equent Defaults, <HI>Capello</HI> was after|wards forced to ju&s;tify him&s;elf, as will be &s;igni|fied in the &s;equel of this Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The Particulars of this Advice, were by an expre&s;s Me&s;&s;enger di&s;patched to <HI>Luigi Contari|ni</HI> the Bailo or Amba&s;&s;ador for the Venetians at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> a Per&s;on of great Reputation and
<PB N="40" REF="23">E&s;teem, having been conver&s;ant in the principal Courts of Chri&s;tendom, and employed for the &s;pace of &s;even years at <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> where he was A&s;&s;i&s;tant with the Nuntio <HI>Chigi,</HI> afterwards <HI>Alexander</HI> the <HI>7th,</HI> in the general Peace of <HI>Eu|rope.</HI></P>
<P>The Turks al&s;o receiving this News aggrava|ted to them with all the foul Circum&s;tances ima|ginable, the Chimacam immediately &s;ummoned the Bailo to Audience, and with an Angry Countenance began to exclaim: <Q>That taking advantage of the Grand Signior's ab&s;ence in remote Parts, the Venetians had, in a perfidi|dious and ho&s;tile manner, a&s;&s;aulted and de|&s;troyed the Fleet of <HI>Barbary,</HI> which were his Subjects, and &s;uch as he had called to his a&s;&s;i|&s;tance again&s;t the Cor&s;ares of <HI>Malta</HI> and <HI>Li|gorn.</HI> That being accidentally compelled by &s;torm to enter into the Port of <HI>Valonia,</HI> they were forcibly taken thence, and violence offer|ed to the Grand Signior's Port and Ca&s;tle, by way of a manife&s;t and open Breach. If this pre&s;umption were grounded on the long di|&s;tance of the Grand Signior from the&s;e parts, the Venetians would do well to con&s;ider, how that they provoke an angry Prince, and one who e&s;teems neither Expence, Hazards, nor Labours to compleat his Revenge. If this were a de&s;ign to divert the Grand Signior's Arms from <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> they would do well to con|&s;ider, that the Sultan was not &s;o far advanced, but that he could turn a Current, if he plea|&s;ed, &s;ufficient to drown, and in an in&s;tant to overwhelm the Dominions of <HI>Venice;</HI> or could at lea&s;t collect Forces from nearer parts able to revenge his Quarrel, and vindicate his Ho|nour from the Di&s;dain and Scorn of &s;uch pet|ty Neighbours.</Q></P>
<P>Hereunto the Bailo or Amba&s;&s;ador made this Reply: <Q>That this Piratical People was the &s;ame which the Year before had landed in <HI>Can|dia,</HI> and made &s;poil of the E&s;tates of the In|habitants, and carried many of them into &s;la|very; and not contented with this Booty, they entred the Gulph, and penetrated into the ve|ry Bowels of <HI>Italy,</HI> with de&s;ign to Sack and Plunder the I&s;land of <HI>Li&s;&s;a,</HI> which was under the Dominion of the Republick. That the Ve|netian General friendly &s;aluted the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Valona,</HI> which was returned with &s;everal Shots from thence; that had it been his intention to have attempted the Port in the beginning, he would not have lain thirty &s;even days in ex|pectation of the forth-coming of tho&s;e Pirats, it being only re&s;pect to the Grand Signior, which obliged him to that attendance. At length being wearied, and provoked by the in&s;olenee of that People, he forcibly entred the Port, knowing, that by Capitulations with the Grand Signior, it was agreed, That all Ports &s;hould be forbidden, and that to the&s;e Pirats, unle&s;s they fir&s;t gave Security and Cau|tion not to injure and make Prize of the Sub|jects of the Republick.</Q></P>
<P>The Chimacam replied hereunto, <Q>That there were ten thou&s;and Souldiers and Slaves belonging to tho&s;e Gallies, which had taken their Refuge in <HI>Valona;</HI> and therefore he re|quired the Venetians to permit them free pa&s;|&s;age into their own Country, and to re&s;tore their Gallies, unle&s;s they intended to come to an open Rupture with the Grand Signior.</Q></P>
<P>The Chimacam al&s;o pre&s;&s;ed more urgently for re&s;titution of the Gallies, in regard, that having advi&s;ed the Grand Signior of this Di&s;a&s;ter, he had at the &s;ame time given him hopes, and al|mo&s;t a&s;&s;urance to believe, that by his Negotia|tions he &s;hould recover them out of their Hands: But the Senate was of a different Opinion; and therefore gave expre&s;s Orders to their Officers of the Marine Affairs, immediatly to &s;ink all tho&s;e Ve&s;&s;els; that &s;o the expectation of the Turks being di&s;appointed by an impo&s;&s;ibility of recovery, might not, by the rude In&s;tances and Threats of <HI>Morat,</HI> oblige them to a di&s;honoura|ble and an undecent Re&s;titution.</P>
<P>The News of this Misfortune made greater noi&s;e and di&s;turbance in the Divan of <HI>Algier</HI> than at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Alge|rines angry at this News.</NOTE> that rude Rabble raved, and railed, and threatned, laying the blame &s;ometimes on one, then on another, being ready to come to blows among&s;t them&s;elves; but that being obliged, by order of their Divan, to keep their Thumbs within their Girdles, they dur&s;t only expre&s;s their Anger by Punches and Thru&s;ts of their Elbows. At length coming to cooler Terms, they charged all the Fault on their Ad|miral <HI>Ali,</HI> and re&s;olved to make Applications to the Grand Signior for Redre&s;s, and Repara|tions on the E&s;tates af the Venetians in his Do|minions.</P>
<P>The News al&s;o hereof overtaking <HI>Morat</HI> in his March into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The G.

<P>The Command for the Bailo's Impri&s;onment being arrived at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> he was &s;ummon|ed to Audience by the Chimacam; and though at that time he was exceedingly afflicted with the Gout, yet the Turki&s;h Obedience to Impe|rial Commands admitting of no Excu&s;e, he was forced to an attendance; and being brought in his Sedan, he was carried to the Chamber of Audience, where he expected &s;ome time until the Chimacam came to him: in the interim being entertained by &s;ome Aga's, whom the Chimacam had employed to &s;ound him touching the re&s;ti|tution of the Ve&s;&s;els; who finding by his Di&s;|cour&s;e that they were &s;unk, without po&s;&s;ibility of recovery, and that there could be no com|pen&s;ation made for them, they returned with this An&s;wer to the Chimacam: of which being now informed, he came in, and having no far|ther to expo&s;tulate on this Matter, produced the Grand Signior's Command for his Impri&s;onment, and ki&s;&s;ing it fir&s;t, cau&s;ed it to be road. The Bailo replied, That he was ready to &s;ubmit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Vene|tians Bailo impri&s;onec.</NOTE> being not only willing to &s;uffer Impri&s;onment, but al&s;o Martyrdom, accompanied with the &s;e|vere&s;t Pains, for the &s;ake of his Prince and his Country.</P>
<P>To &s;often and mitigate Matters, the other Chri&s;tian Amba&s;&s;adors then re&s;ident at the Port, had made Arz to the Grand Signior, wherein, with all reverence and re&s;pect, they offered them&s;elves for Mediators in this Difference, en|gaging them&s;elves, but not the Parole of their
<PB N="41" REF="23">Princes, for the Per&s;on of the Bailo, that he &s;hould not fly from the Port, nor yet refu&s;e any rea&s;onable Terms by way of Accommodation. This Mediation of the Amba&s;&s;adors, &s;econded with &s;ome Pre&s;ents from the Bailo to the Turki&s;h Mini&s;ters, &s;o facilitated Matters, that the Bailo at fir&s;t was conducted to the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The Chi|micam's Steward.</NOTE> Kahya's Chamber, and afterwards was confined to his own Hou&s;e in <HI>Galata,</HI> guarded by four Chiaou&s;es, with free Liberty to all Vi&s;itants what&s;oever.</P>
<P>There was now no other Rumour or Di&s;cour&s;e in <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> but of a War with <HI>Venice,</HI> &s;o &s;oon as that with <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> was concluded: And in the mean time the Grand Signior gave Orders, that ten Gallies &s;hould be built in his own Ar&s;e|nal at his Charge, and pre&s;ented to the Barba|rou&s;es, with condition that they &s;hould &s;tay un|til the Spring, and accompany his Fleet to Sea. But <HI>Ali Picenin</HI> the Admiral &s;u&s;pecting that this was only a Snare to engage him and his Men for ever in the Grand Signior's Service, refu&s;ed the Obligation, and &s;et two Gallies on the Stocks for his own Account.</P>
<P>Advice of the Bailo's Confinement being come to <HI>Venice,</HI> with a Report of the Pa&s;&s;ion and Rage of the Sultan, they expected nothing more than a War with the Turk, which they communica|ted to all Chri&s;tian Princes, reque&s;ting their Succours and A&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the common Ene|my. The&s;e Addre&s;&s;es produced rather Compa&s;|&s;ion of their Ca&s;e, than &s;ub&s;tantial Contributi|ons: Pope <HI>&V;rban</HI> him&s;elf giving them great A&s;&s;u|rances of &s;ome help from the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Reve|nues, be&s;ides Proce&s;&s;ions, Ma&s;&s;es, and Benedicti|ons for their good Succe&s;s, in as great a Number as they could de&s;ire: Notwith&s;tanding which due Care wast taken to make ready and provide again&s;t all Encounters. Letters were wrote to the Captain-General in the Levant, to make due Preparations again&s;t the Enemy: Sixteen Gallies were armed out of <HI>Candia,</HI> to which were joyn|ed other Gallea&s;&s;es under the Command of <HI>Anto|nio Pi&s;ani</HI> and <HI>Seba&s;tiano Veniero:</HI> Souldiers were levied in every Place, and all Garri&s;ons provided with Ammunition and Victuals, and reinforced with Numbers of an Auxiliary Militia. How&s;o|ever it was not the Bu&s;ine&s;s nor Advantage of the Venetians, to make a War with the Turks, but rather, whil&s;t they feared the wor&s;t, and made Provi&s;ions again&s;t the utmo&s;t Extremities, they endeavoured to enter into Treaties of Peace, and to qualifie the hot Spirit of the Grand Signior with the gentle Lenitives of fair Words, and proffers of making Atonement with the Sacrifice of Gold and other Pre&s;ents: In order unto which they wrote a Letter to the Grand Signior to this Effect.</P>
<P><Q>That being provoked by the In&s;olence and frequent Robberies of the Pirates of <HI>Barbary,</HI> who did not e&s;teem Faith or Obedience to his Maje&s;ty, nor the Commands which he had of|ten fent to re&s;train them, they were induced, out of natural Defence of them&s;elves, to cha|&s;ti&s;e and correct them; but as this was acted without intention to di&s;oblige his Maje&s;ty, &s;o they were ready to maintain and cultivate that ancient Friend&s;hip and Corre&s;pondence which was ingrafted on the firm Root of his Glorious Progenitors.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Morat,</HI> though he received this Letter in an huff, and gave an An&s;wer to it with Di&s;dain, which breathed nothing but Threats of Revenge, and total De&s;truction; yet he &s;ent it by an Ex|pre&s;s of his own to <HI>Venice,</HI> couching &s;omething within the Terrour of his Words, as if there was place left for an Accommodation, if the Venetians knew what Salve was to be applied to obduct the Skin of this bleeding Wound. The Venetians quickly apprehended, that Gold was the only Remedy, of which they were ready to contribute freely; &s;ince they could make no better a Pur|cha&s;e with their Money than Peace, not could make a better Bargain than with &s;uch a Sum as would &s;erve only to make the fir&s;t Preparations of War, to evade all Hazards, Troubles, and Ca|lamities by a happy and &s;afe Conclu&s;ion of Peace. The which notwith&s;tanding took no Effect, until the Return of <HI>Morat</HI> from <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> and therefore we &s;hall defer Di&s;cour&s;e thereof to its proper place.</P>
<P><HI>Amurat</HI> marched now at the Head of a formida|ble Army,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Morat</HI> marches to <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></NOTE> cloathed in the Habit of a Jani&s;ary, to render him&s;elf acceptable to the Militia, whom having &s;ubdued by Rigour and &s;evere Di&s;cipline, he would now oblige by Courte&s;ie and fairer Treatment: With Courage and great Patience he marched through &s;andy De&s;arts and unfre|quented Places; and being the fir&s;t who offered to expo&s;e him&s;elf to Dangers and Sufferings, the Souldiery followed willingly his Example, e&s;tee|ming no Attempts either hazardous or tedious, in which they &s;aw them&s;elves preceded by their Valiant General. In this March he was overta|ken by one who rode hard to demand <HI>Mo&s;taluck,</HI> which is the Reward of good News for the Birth of a Son, of which one of his Sultana's was deli|vered at <HI>I&s;mit:</HI> the Me&s;&s;enger was &s;ecured until the News was confirmed; which being after|wards turned to the Birth of a Daughter, the poor Man &s;uffered Death, being cruelly impaled for his unadvi&s;ed ha&s;te and exce&s;s of officious Re|&s;pect towards his Ptince.</P>
<P>The Great Vizier met his Ma&s;ter at <HI>Iconium</HI> with a moderate Equipage, to give more Room for the Quarters of the Army, and rendring him|&s;elf more gracious in his Eyes by a Pre&s;ent of fif|ty thou&s;and Dollars, he was again remunerated with a Cemiter and a Ve&s;t of Sables, which are the u&s;ual Signals of the Sultan's Favour.</P>
<P>All <HI>A&s;ia</HI> was now in Arms, and the Princes and great Men came in to perform their Duty, ac|companied with their Forces and Attendance: Only Complaints were made of a certain Shegh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Shegh rebels.</NOTE> Santone or Preacher belonging to the Mountains of <HI>Anatolia,</HI> who had refu&s;ed to do Homage; or &s;erve in the War: He was one, who by a feig|ned Sanctity had acquired a great Reputation a|mong&s;t his People; and having declared him&s;elf to be the <HI>Mehedy,</HI> or the Mediator, which, accor|ding to the Mahometan Doctrine, is to fore-run Antichri&s;t, for reducing all the World to one Unity of Faith: He had per&s;waded his People, that he, and they under him, were by Priviledge of his Office, exempted from all Taxes, Contri|butions, or Impo&s;itions by any Secular Power what&s;oever. The Grand Signior who could not under&s;tand or believe this Doctrine, pre&s;ently detached a &s;trong Body with &s;ome Cannon under Command of the Captain-Pa&s;ha (who, as we have &s;aid, was to accompany the Grand Signior in the War) to confute the Principies of this Rebel, and to reduce him to Obedience. The&s;e Forces being entred on his Dominions, Procla|mation was made to the People, that they &s;hould deliver up their Impo&s;tor into the hands of Ju|&s;tice; which if they refu&s;ed to do, then Fire and Sword was to be their Portion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is over|come and puni&s;hed.</NOTE> and De&s;truction to extend even unto their Children of &s;even years of Age. This terrible Denunciation of the Sultan's Sentence &s;truck all the People with cold Fear and Amazement; how&s;oever the Shegh a|vailing him&s;elf on certain Prophecies, which he
<PB N="42" REF="24">interpreted in his own Favour, adventured to &s;tand a &s;hock with the Grand Signior's Forces; but being overcome by them the Shegh was ta|ken alive and carried to the Grand signior; who having given a &s;top to his March at <HI>Iconium,</HI> un|til the end of this Bu&s;ine&s;s, he condemned him to be flead alive; and in this Gui&s;e being a horrid Spectacle to all Beholders, he was carried upon an A&s;s to the Wheel, on which he &s;eemed to en|dure the Remainder of his Puni&s;hment without any &s;en&s;ible Touches or Pangs in the Torments.</P>
<P>This Succe&s;s being attained, <HI>Morat</HI> proceeded in his March, and pa&s;&s;ing through <HI>Alexandretta</HI> or <HI>Scanderone,</HI> he was there &s;aluted by the Guns of all the Engli&s;h and Dutch Ships then in Port, and pre&s;ented by the Merchants and Con&s;uls, e&s;|pecially by the Venetian called <HI>Marco Fo&s;colo,</HI> who&s;e Pre&s;ents were computed to amount unto the Value of ten thou&s;and Dollars. Thence he proceeded to <HI>Antioch,</HI> where he refre&s;hed his Ar|my for a few days, ob&s;erving the Antiquities of that Place. At <HI>Aleppo</HI> he was met by the Pa&s;ha of Grand <HI>Cairo,</HI> who brought with him a rich Tri|bute, accompanied with an Army of twenty four thou&s;and Souldiers, all choice Men well armed and well cloathed; at the &s;ame Place al&s;o the For|ces of <HI>Pale&s;tine</HI> joyned with him, &s;o that his Ar|my was now increa&s;ed to a va&s;t Number. Pro|ceeding forward new Sangiacks came in daily belonging to the Countries through which they marched, and a &s;trong Party of Tartars de&s;pai|ring of being able to act any con&s;iderable Matter again&s;t <HI>A&s;ac,</HI> offered them&s;elves to the Service of the Grand Signior.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> entred the Field at the Head of an hundred and twenty thou&s;and Hor&s;e;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Per&s;ian Army dares not give Battel to the Turk.</NOTE> but being inferiour in Force, made only u&s;e of them to reinforce his Garri&s;on of <HI>Bagdat</HI> with an Addition of thirty thou&s;and Men; which now being well provided, he judged that the Force within, and the Strength of the Place would be able to endure a long Siege, and with time wea|ken, if not de&s;troy the va&s;t numbers of the Turks, of which there were former Examples: With the re&s;t of his Forces he returned to encounter the Great <HI>Mogul,</HI> who (as we have &s;aid) promi&s;ed <HI>Morat</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in this War, and attack the Per&s;ian on the other &s;ide of his Dominions, which &s;erved for an advantageous Diver&s;ion to the Turk. This was the Rea&s;on that no memorable Battels &s;ucceeded in the Field, there being none of greater Note than a Fight which <HI>Quinan</HI> Pa&s;ha had with two thou&s;and Per&s;ians belonging to <HI>Re|van,</HI> with whom accidentally encountring, he killed fifteen hundred of them on the Place, and took the re&s;t Pri&s;oners, which being five hundred in number were brought before <HI>Morat,</HI> and all barbarou&s;ly put to death by him.</P>
<P>During the time of this March, <HI>Morat</HI> often exerci&s;ed him&s;elf in Feats of Arms, to &s;hew his &s;trength of Body and dexterity of Hand; a|mong&s;t other things wonderful to the Souldiers, he pierced a Suit of Arms of Musket-Proof, with a Dart, called by them a <HI>Gerit,</HI> thrown from his Hand; for evidence of which, the Armour is placed on one of the Gates of <HI>Aleppo,</HI> with an In&s;cription under it.</P>
<P>About the Beginning of the Month of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> the Turki&s;h Army pa&s;&s;ed the River <HI>Euphrates,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Turks pa&s;s the Ri|ver <HI>Eu|phrates.</HI></NOTE> by means of a Bridge, which was not &s;o well built, but that it &s;unk under the weight of Hor&s;es, Ca|mels, and Baggage, by which Di&s;a&s;ter many pe|ri&s;hed in the Water, which great Rains had &s;wel|led above the Bounds of its Banks. As this nu|merous Army proceeded, &s;o all Petty Princes ap|plied them&s;elves to perform their Homage; a|mong&s;t which one Tarpos a King of the Arabs came with his Wife, Mother, and Son to pro&s;trate him&s;elf before the Sultan: He was entertained in the Tent of the Favourite, who being always in company with <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="3 letters">at</HI> was never &s;uffered to &s;e|parate from him, and his Tent, more for O&s;tenta|tion, than to &s;erve his occa&s;ion. <HI>Tarpos</HI> being ad|mitted to Audience, was received with Re&s;pect and a favourable Countenance, and pre&s;ented with a Ve&s;t of Cloth of Gold lined with Sables, and a &s;mall Pur&s;e of Gold: In recompence where|of the Arab Prince returned certain choice Hor&s;es and two Leopards. In like manner the Georgi|ans and Mengrelians, who are Tributaries to Turk and Per&s;ian, and commonly incline to the &s;tronge&s;t &s;ide, who&s;e Nations we have de&s;cribed <HI>in the pre&s;ent State of the Ottoman Empire,</HI> would not be wanting at this time to bring their Tri|bute of eighty thou&s;and yards of Linen-cloth, which they pay every three year, with &s;ome Chil|dren of both Sexes cho&s;en out of the comelie&s;t and mo&s;t healthful among&s;t them.</P>
<P>At <HI>Mo&s;ul</HI> the Army lay encamped for &s;ome time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Turki&s;h Army at <HI>Mo&s;ul.</HI></NOTE> where was a general Rendezvous and Con|fluence of People from all Parts, and every thing ordered and modelized for a War. Severe Di&s;|cipline was kept among&s;t all, Offenders were Impaled, Flead alive, their Bowels ript out, and thrown into the publick Ways: Nor did Takers of Tobacco e&s;cape with le&s;s Puni&s;hment than the re&s;t. In the mean time Wine was for|bid to his whole Camp, unle&s;s to him&s;elf and his Favourite, being a Royal drink; and when the chief Phy&s;ician commended the admirable vertue of Opium, advi&s;ing <HI>Morat</HI> to u&s;e it in the place of Wine, he enjoyned him to make his Words good by his own Example, and thereby for|ced him to take &s;o much, that he was over|come, and died by &s;wallowing too great a quantity.</P>
<P>From <HI>Mo&s;ul</HI> the Army marched in due order to <HI>Babylon,</HI> where the Great Vizier arrived with thirty thou&s;and Men about the <HI>19th</HI> of <HI>October:</HI> But by rea&s;on of the great weight of Artillery, and the many Impediments which at|tend &s;uch va&s;t numbers, the Grand Signior came not thither till the <HI>5th</HI> of <HI>November,</HI> and on the <HI>9th</HI> the whole Turki&s;h Army pre&s;ented it &s;elf be|fore the Walls of <HI>Babylon.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Babylon</HI> the anciente&s;t City of the World,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The De|&s;cription of <HI>Babylon,</HI> or <HI>Bagdat.</HI></NOTE> reported to be built by <HI>Nimrod</HI> on the Banks of the River <HI>Euphrates,</HI> and afterwards beautified and enlarged by <HI>Semiramis</HI> the Wife of <HI>Ninus,</HI> is recorded in Hi&s;tory for the va&s;tne&s;s thereof to be one of the &s;even Miracles of the World. Afterwards the furious Inundations of the Ri|ver, and the Iron Teeth of devouring Time, and the &s;ubjection thereof to the Macedonian Empire, did much eclip&s;e the Glory of that City, and cau&s;ed <HI>Seleucus Nicanor,</HI> one of <HI>Alex|ander</HI>'s Captains, to build a new one where the <HI>Tigris</HI> and <HI>Euphrates</HI> meet, forty Miles more Northwards than the old <HI>Babylon,</HI> which he there|fore called <HI>Seleucia</HI> after his own Name. In the Year of our Lord 753, <HI>Abugiafer Alman&s;or,</HI> an Arab King, enlarged this City to the Ea&s;tern &s;ide of the <HI>Tigris,</HI> as being le&s;s &s;ubject to the In|undations of the River, giving it the Name of <HI>Badgat,</HI> or the place of Gardens; but his Son <HI>Almolied</HI> being more plea&s;ed with the We&s;tern &s;ide, encouraged People to build the &s;tatelie&s;t Palaces and be&s;t Fabricks near the place where he delighted to keep his Court, &s;o that the River <HI>Ti|gris</HI> divided the City. The which with the Coun|try thereabouts was &s;ubdued by <HI>Solyman</HI> the Mag|nificent; and afterwards in the Year 1625; it was
<PB N="43" REF="24">recovered by <HI>Abas</HI> King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> until at length in this of 1638. it was vanqui&s;hed by the mighty Force and Prowe&s;s of this Magnanimous Sultan, as we &s;hall now under&s;tand.</P>
<P>The numerous Troops of the Ottoman Army covering all the Plains,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bagdat be|&s;ieged.</NOTE> a General Council of War was called of the Chief Commanders of the Jani|&s;aries and Spahees, e&s;pecially of &s;uch who had been practi&s;ed in the Sieges of the &s;trong Fortre&s;|&s;es in <HI>Hungary.</HI> After &s;ome Debate and long Con&s;ideration, it was agreed, That the City &s;hould be battered in three Places. One Battery of twelve Pieces of Cannon commanded by the Great Vizier was to be erected again&s;t the Bright Gate; the &s;econd again&s;t the Dark Gate of ten Pieces of Cannon, under the Command of the Captain-Pa&s;ha: and a third of eight Pieces direct|ed again&s;t the Gate of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> under the Govern|ment of <HI>Chu&s;aein</HI> Pa&s;ha Beglerbei of <HI>Anatolia.</HI> The Grand Signior in the mean time habited like an ordinary Souldier, that he might be the le&s;s expo&s;ed to Danger, vi&s;ited all Po&s;ts and Places, encouraging them with his Words and Pre&s;ence, prote&s;ting that he would not change his Cloaths for ever in any place but within the Walls of <HI>Bag|dat.</HI> In the &s;pace of three days the Trenches were opened, the Batteries rai&s;ed, and the Cannon planted; and <HI>Morat</HI> having made Korban, gave fire to the fir&s;t Cannot with his own Hand, as he had brought the fir&s;t Basket of Earth to rai&s;e the Works. The Defendants within con&s;i&s;ted of eighty thou&s;and fighting Men, with which they made frequent Sallies of four and five thou&s;and Men at a time, who being retired, were again &s;e|conded by another of the like Number, which put the Turki&s;h Camp into much Confu&s;ion, and into danger of having their Trenches levelled, and their Cannon &s;piked; but the Turks valiantly fighting, the Slaughter proved bloody on both &s;ides; and being guided rather by the Bravery of their Courage, than by Art or Experience in in War, they carried their Works forward to the very Brink of the Ditch, having an Italian and a Candiot for their chief Engineers; who though they were not Per&s;ons of that Ability, as our modern Times have produced, yet they were &s;uch, as for want of better, &s;erved the pre&s;ent occa&s;ions, where force and Numbers, with &s;mall Additions of Art, were the mo&s;t available. For in this Siege the Sword was more exerci&s;ed than the Spade or Mattock, and there was more need of Arms than Works; for the con&s;tant Sallies kept the Turks always watchful and imployed, and perpetually di&s;turbed them, until at length they were forced with great Labour to rai&s;e a high Circumvallation, with a very deep Ditch, defended by &s;everal Redoubts; whereby the Be&s;ieged be|ing kept in, thier Numbers decrea&s;ed by former Sallies, and their Courages abated by de&s;pair of Relief, they began to grow cold in the Acts of Bravery, and to re&s;erve their Men for the ulti|mate and la&s;t Efforts of Defence. In the mean time the Turks plied their Batteries &s;o hotly, that in a few days the Walls were laid open almo&s;t fif|ty paces wide. In this Condition the Defendants having no other Refuge than &s;ome &s;mall Re|trenchments, which they had made during the Siege, were expo&s;ed to the open Force of the E|nemy. For now the Turks having filled up the fir&s;t and &s;econd Ditches with Sacks of Wool, Fag|gots, and other Rubbi&s;h, crowded in va&s;t Num|bers to enter the Breach, which the Per&s;ians de|fended as &s;toutly with Stones, Bullets, Artificial Fires, and all In&s;truments of Death, which fell like Showers of Hail on the Heads of the Ene|my. The Great Vizier &s;ignalizing him&s;elf above all by his undaunted Courage, commanding with his Hand and Voice, was unhappily &s;hot by a Musket-bullet, and fell on the heaps of the dead, among&s;t whom there is no di&s;tinction between the common Souldier and the brave&s;t Captain. This Fight within the Breach continued for five days, where both &s;ides fighting like Men in de|&s;pair, the dead Bodies lay in heaps, and Blood was &s;tagnated like a Pool to wade thorough. At length the Numbers of the Turks prevailing, commanded now by <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> the Captain-Pa&s;ha, entred the Town by force of Arms on the twenty &s;econd of <HI>December</HI> about the time of Sun-&s;et, when the Royal Standard of the Turks was plan|ted in this City. How&s;oever twenty four thou|&s;and of the Per&s;ians remaining &s;till alive, and u|nited in a Body, capitulated for Quarter, other|wi&s;e threatning not to die unrevenged: Pardon, and Quarter for their Lives was readily granted, on Confidence of which the Per&s;ians threw down their Arms, and &s;ubmitted to the Publick Faith, or the Sultan's Clemency.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bagdat</HI> taken.</NOTE> But the Grand Signior afterwards con&s;idering, that the granting Quar|ter at <HI>Revan</HI> had been the cau&s;e of the Lo&s;s of the City, he repented him of his Promi&s;e, and gave Order to the Jani&s;aries mo&s;t inhumanely to open a Torrent a Blood, and make a barbarous Ma&s;&s;a|cre of tho&s;e who had newly thrown down their Arms at his Feet, not &s;paring either Woman or Child, either Sex or Age; the which Slaughter, like a Work of Darkne&s;s, was acted in the Night by the light of Torches and Lanthorns, and ap|peared a horrid Spectacle to all, e&s;pecially to the Per&s;ian Amba&s;&s;adour, who being conducted like a Pri&s;oner in the Camp, was a &s;ad Spectator of his Countries De&s;truction on the horrid Theatre of its Capital City.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as <HI>Bagdat</HI> was taken, <HI>Morat</HI> di&s;patch|ed away Po&s;ts immediately with the News in|to all Parts, and wrote a Letter with his own Hand to the Chimacam, ordering a <HI>Dunalma</HI> or Fea&s;t of Thank&s;giving, and rejoicing for the &s;pace of twenty Days; during which time no Bu&s;ine&s;s was to be acted, the Hou&s;es were to be adorned both without and within with the be&s;t Furniture, and every Hou&s;e was to &s;et forth Lights, Torches, and Fire-works agreeable to the Condition and Ability of the Per&s;on. The People exclaimed hereat as too great an Expence, and the Vacation from Bu&s;ine&s;s &s;eemed too long for tho&s;e who lived by their daily Labour. The chief Mini&s;ters and Grandees evidenced external actions of Joy, but inwardly feared and tremb|led, &s;u&s;pecting that the fierce and cruel Humour of their Sultan would be elated, and rendred more tyrannical and untractable by Succe&s;s and a favourable Fortune. The Chri&s;tian Princes re|ceived this Intelligence like bad News, and as an Alarm to awaken then from the ea&s;ine&s;s of Peace, to expectations of War: For War with <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> was like an Ulcer in the Bowels of the Turki&s;h Empire, which gangreen'd and con&s;u|med the Strength and Marrow of their Power; which now being cured, and the Body Poli|tick rendred healthy by &s;uch a &s;ea&s;onable Succe&s;s, would convert it &s;elf to Enterpri&s;es pernicious and dangerous to the neighbouring States.</P>
<P>After the Conque&s;t of this City, <HI>Morat</HI> gave out, That he re&s;olved to procced with his Army into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and to enter the Walls of <HI>Spahan;</HI> but having &s;ome indi&s;po&s;itions of Health upon him, and recalled by the charming Letters of a Favourite Mi&s;tre&s;s, whom he had left at <HI>Diarbechir,</HI> he inclined to return again to <HI>Con|&s;tantinople.</HI> Wherefore mu&s;tering fir&s;t his Army,
<PB N="44" REF="25">he found that it was abated near an hundred thou&s;and Men, two thirds whereof being killed in the War, the re&s;t peri&s;hed by the Pe&s;tilence, and other Di&s;ea&s;es and Maladies incident to Camps; a great part of the Slaughter fell on the mo&s;t veterane Souldiers of the Jani&s;aries and Spahees, of which many of the Chief being &s;lain, their Lands and Revenues returned to the Grand Signior, and gave him both Opportunity and Ability to reward many with &s;uch Offices and Gifts as came by the Death and Fall of other Commanders. Thus the Captain-Pa&s;ha, who&s;e Valour had rendred him Famous, was made Great Vizier in the place of him that was &s;lain, and the Per&s;ian Favourite was con&s;tituted Cap|tain-Pa&s;ha; and though many repined at this Advancement, as conferred on a Stranger, and a Per&s;on without Merit, yet the Grand Sig|nior con&s;idered him as one who&s;e Experience in that Country, and the Information he had given him of the Scituation and Strength of <HI>Babylon,</HI> had made abundant Compen&s;ation for the Favour and Honour he had be&s;towed upon him.</P>
<P>The Grand Signior having left a Gari&s;on of thirty thou&s;and Men in <HI>Bagdat,</HI> di&s;patched the Great Vizier with a con&s;iderable Army to penetrate far into the Country of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> And having now relea&s;ed the Per&s;ian Amba&s;&s;adour, giving him liberty to return to his Ma&s;ter, wrote by him this braving Letter.</P>

<P>This Letter being di&s;patched, the Grand Sig|nior recalled the forty thou&s;and Men which he had lent, from the Service of the Great <HI>Mogul,</HI> which he quartered about <HI>Bagdat</HI> to hinder the Attempts of the Per&s;ians, in ca&s;e they &s;hould de|&s;ign to pur&s;ue him in the Rear, and di&s;turb his return into <HI>Europe.</HI> By rea&s;on of the Rigour and Extremity of the Winter, and a certain Defluxion which falling on his Nerves, made him &s;omething Paralytical,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Grand Signior re|turns to <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople.</HI></NOTE> the Grand Signior depar|ted not from <HI>Bagdat</HI> until the <HI>15th</HI> of <HI>April,</HI> and then for recovery of his Health, and to &s;oil the Hor&s;es by the way with convenience of Gra&s;s, &s;hort Days Journeys were appointed.</P>
<P>The Grand Signior's Indi&s;po&s;ition encrea&s;ing, with &s;ome cold and &s;hivering Fits, gave the fir&s;t Symptoms of a Feaver; but afterwards it plainly appearing to be a paralytical Di&s;temper, &s;u&s;pe|cted by the Phy&s;icians to end in an Apoplexy, it was rumoured abroad, that <HI>Morat</HI> was dead; but it was whi&s;pered with &s;uch Caution, as if they had feared le&s;t the Grand Signior would have over-heard them, and ri&s;en from his Grave to puni&s;h their &s;ecret and inward Joy. Being &s;ome|what recovered from the la&s;t Acce&s;&s;ion of his Pal&s;ie, the Humour fell into his Legs, and &s;welled &s;o much, that he could &s;carce &s;it upon his Hor&s;e; how&s;oever he ha&s;tened as fa&s;t as he could to <HI>Con|&s;tantinople</HI> to di&s;prove and confute the fal&s;ity of that Report concerning his Death.</P>
<P>In the mean time it is not to be expre&s;&s;ed with what Fear and Terrour the Chimacam and other great Mini&s;ters of State expected the return of their formidable Prince, not knowing where the Thunderbolt of his cruel Di&s;po&s;ition would &s;trike, until at length it fell on the Head of the poor Sultan <HI>Mu&s;tapha,</HI> who&s;e weakne&s;s, as it ren|dred him unable for Government and Command, &s;o it made him &s;tupid and in&s;en&s;ible of Death.</P>
<P>At length on the <HI>10th</HI> of <HI>June</HI> the Grand Sig|nior arrived at <HI>Con&s;tantinople:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Grand Signior's Entry into <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople.</HI></NOTE> The Favourite <HI>Soltana,</HI> which had accompanied him to the War, pa&s;&s;ed by Water from <HI>I&s;mit</HI> attended with &s;ix Gallies, and took her Lodging the fir&s;t Night of her arrival at a &s;mall Chiosk or Hou&s;e of Plea&s;ure under the Wall, &s;o as to make a magni|ficent Entry the Day following. Her Coach was covered with Cloth of Gold, and the Spokes of the Wheels were gilded, and the Wheels &s;hod with Silver; &s;he was followed by twelve Coaches, and the Mufti, Pa&s;ha's, Kadees, and other Offi|cers went before to conduct her to the Seraglio. The Grand Signior, who arrived the &s;ame Day, attended with fifty &s;ix Gallies, made not his &s;o|lemn Entry until two Days after, being perform|ed with all the Ceremony, State, and Magnifi|cence which could be contrived. The Grand Signior in his own Per&s;on appeared in the Per&s;ian Habit, with a Leopard's Skin thrown over his Shoulders, after the manner of a Kau&s;ee (as they call them) or a brave huffing Champion, having his Stirrup attended with twenty two of the chie|fe&s;t Nobles, whom he had re&s;erved at <HI>Bagdat,</HI> purpo&s;ely to lead in Triumph when he made this Entry. The Trea&s;ure brought to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> was landed at the Seraglio out of ten Gallies, and calculated to amount to a greater Sum than that which was carried from thence; for be&s;ides the
<PB N="45" REF="25">Riches taken in the Plunder of <HI>Babylon,</HI> &s;ei&s;ure was mad in divers places of the E&s;tates of Pa&s;ha's and other Great Men, which by Death, or for Crimes, e&s;cheated to the Grand Signior.</P>
<P>After the Grand Signior's Departure out of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> little of Action &s;ucceeded, as if by mutu|al Agreement, a Truce or Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms had been contrived. The Per&s;ians de&s;ired a Peace, becau&s;e they were enfeebled and tired with the War: The Turks had regained their Honour by the Conque&s;t of <HI>Badgat;</HI> and being unwilling to lo&s;e it by change of uncon&s;tant Fortune, and lon|ger con&s;ume their Riches and Men in a tedious and remote March, were attending to receive Propo&s;itions of Peace fir&s;t offered by the Per&s;i|an. To effect which the Great Vizier, who was left at <HI>Badgat</HI> to command the Army, intimated to the Governours of the Frontiers, that a prof|fer of Peace &s;hould be accepted;<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Amba&s;|&s;ador &s;ent from <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> to the Grand Signior.</NOTE> which being made known to the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> he immediate|ly di&s;patched an Amba&s;&s;adour to the Grand Sig|nior to propo&s;e Terms of Accommodation. The Amba&s;&s;adour being arrived at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> was grateful and acceptable to all, and his Day of Au|dience appointed after the u&s;ual manner on the Pay-day of the Jani&s;aries, when the Floor of the Divan is covered with Sacks of Mony; before the Door of the Chamber of Audience &s;tood the Per&s;ian Captives all cloathed in rich Ve&s;ts. The Amba&s;&s;adour being conducted to the Royal Pre|&s;ence with the u&s;ual Ceremonies (of which we have given an Account in another place) was re|ceived by the Sultan &s;itting upon a Saffaw cove|red with Crim&s;on Velvet, embroidered with Pearl; his Turbant was encompa&s;&s;ed with a Chain of Diamonds, cloathed with a rich Ve&s;t lined with Sables; he ca&s;t no Plea&s;antne&s;s of A&s;|pect on the Amba&s;&s;adour, but beholding him with a fierce and &s;cornful Look, received the Letter in a kind of carele&s;s Di&s;dain, behaving him&s;elf in every Motion, as if he neither e&s;teemed the King, nor his Amba&s;&s;adour; or as if the Per&s;ian had been wholly conquered by him, had &s;ent to beg Peace, and Pardon for his Life: The Amba&s;&s;a|dour was &s;oon di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his Pre&s;ence; and matters being referred to the Negotiation of the Chimacam, no other difficulty aro&s;e be&s;ides the Di&s;pute concerning <HI>Revan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Peace concluded.</NOTE> which at length was agreed by another Amba&s;&s;adour &s;ent to the Vizi|er on the Frontiers to remain unto the Per&s;ian, as <HI>Bagdat</HI> was confirmed to the Turk: And &s;o Peace was without long Debate clapt up; the Grand Signior, by rea&s;on of his Indi&s;po&s;ition which in|crea&s;ed upon him, being not inclinable to trou|ble his Head with the Burden of Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Peace being thus concluded with <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> there appeared a perfect Sun-&s;hine and fair Weather in the Ottoman Court, neither Di&s;&s;en&s;ions at home, nor Wars abroad troubling the Quiet and Repo&s;e of the Sultan: Until &s;ome Differences happe|ning between the Princes of <HI>Moldavia</HI> and <HI>Wala|chia</HI> exhaled the fir&s;t Cloud of Di&s;turbance. At that time <HI>Lupulo</HI> was Prince of <HI>Moldavia,</HI> a Per|&s;on of evil Principles, covetous, and unju&s;t. <HI>Mat|thew</HI> was Prince of <HI>Walachia,</HI> a good Man, zea|lous for the Chri&s;tian Religion, and one who ad|mini&s;tred equal Ju&s;tice to his People. <HI>Lupulo</HI> not, contenting him&s;elf with his own, but de&s;irous al|&s;o of his Neighbours Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Troubles in <HI>Moldavia</HI> and <HI>Wala|chia.</HI></NOTE> made in&s;tances to the Port to have the Principality of <HI>Moldavia</HI> con|ferred upon his Son, alledging that thereby he &s;hould be better enabled to balance the Power of <HI>Ragotski</HI> in <HI>Tran&s;ylvania,</HI> and on all occa&s;ions be rendred more &s;erviceable to the Grand Signior's De&s;igns and Intere&s;t: And &s;econding this Propo|&s;ition with a Pre&s;ent of fifty thou&s;and Dollars to the Chimacam, and promi&s;e to increa&s;e the annual Tribute, he obtained the Chimacam's Friend&s;hip, at who&s;e In&s;tance the Grand Sig|nior was per&s;waded to write unto <HI>Matthew</HI> to &s;urrender up his Province into the hands of the Son of <HI>Lupulo;</HI> declaring, That it having been accu&s;tomary to change the Princes of tho&s;e Countries every three years, he ought after an Injoyment of above &s;even years to content him&s;elf with a quiet and voluntary Re|&s;ignation, unle&s;s he would de&s;ire to draw up|on him&s;elf a Ruin by the Anger and Di&s;plea|&s;ure of the Sultan. <HI>Matthew</HI> having no Po|&s;terity, re&s;olved not to &s;urrender his Govern|ment but with his Life; and having a parti|cular Animo&s;ity again&s;t <HI>Lupulo,</HI> could by no means incline his Mind to make his Enemy happy with the Spoils of his E&s;tate. Where|fore having obtained A&s;&s;i&s;tance from <HI>Ragotski,</HI> he re&s;olved to with&s;tand the Forces of young <HI>Lupulo,</HI> and engage with him: And being rea|dy to mount on Hor&s;e-back, and begin the Battel, he fir&s;t di&s;patched an humble Me&s;&s;age to the Grand Signior, acquainting him, <Q>That he was ready at his Command to re&s;ign his Principality into the Hands of the meane&s;t Greek his Maje&s;ty would appoint; who be|ing the Source of all Equity and Ju&s;tice, he hoped that he would not oblige him to &s;uch Terms as would rai&s;e his Mortal Ene|my upon his Ruin; a Man &s;o intent to his own Intere&s;ts, and &s;o uncon&s;cionable to compa&s;s them, that all late Revolutions, Wars, and Commotions have been rai&s;ed either by him, or by his In&s;truments.</Q></P>
<P>This Letter being received and read by the Grand Signior, was &s;econded in a few hours after, with News of the total Defeat of young <HI>Lupulo;</HI> which put the Grand Signior &s;o much into choler, that he immediately committed the Chimacam to the &s;even Towers, for being the Projector and Author of this Coun&s;el. It was &s;uppo&s;ed however, that <HI>Morat</HI>'s Anger would not proceed to that degree, as to extend to his Life; but being informed, that he was rich, and that he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of two Milli|ons of Dollars, which lay by him in ready Mony, it was concluded, that &s;o va&s;t a Wealth could not in a &s;hort time be hone&s;tly gained; which appearing as an undeniable Evidence and Te&s;timony of his Violence and Oppre&s;&s;ion, the Grand Signior made no Difficulty to pa&s;s the Sentence of Death again&s;t him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chima|cam put to Death.</NOTE> nor to con|demn the Mony to his own Exchequer: His Office was given to <HI>Sinan</HI> Pa&s;ha, and the Prin|cipality confirmed unto <HI>Matthew.</HI></P>
<P>During all this Time, the Quarrel which the Turks conceived again&s;t the Venetians, for vio|lating their Port of <HI>Valona,</HI> was not yet com|po&s;ed; but now having time to peru&s;e and con|&s;ider old Accounts, the Venetian Bailo was called by the Chimacam to Audience, and to a Con|ference with him concerning this Matter. In the fir&s;t place therefore the Bailo alledged, <Q>That the Pirates of <HI>Barbary</HI> had for the &s;pace of twenty Years roved in the Venetian Gulf, and made Prize in that time of &s;o many Ships and Goods belonging to Merchants, that the Republick had been prejudiced by them in &s;everal Millions; which al&s;o did in &s;ome manner prejudice the Cu&s;toms of the Grand Signior, to whom the Venetian Mer|chants pay for the mo&s;t part yearly the Sum of an hundred thou&s;and Dollars in Cu&s;tom for their Goods, be&s;ides the benefit which the Ottoman Dominions receive by &s;o profitable a Commerce.</Q></P>
<PB N="46" REF="26">
<P><HI>Hereunto the Chimacam replied:</HI> <Q>That the damages which the Turks received by the Cor&s;airs or Free-booters at Sea under the Colours of <HI>Malta, Leghorn, Majorca,</HI> and other places, were greater and more di&s;ho|nourable to the Maje&s;ty of the Ottoman Grandeur, than the depredations of the other &s;ide were to <HI>Venice:</HI> And therefore it would be nece&s;&s;ary for the good of the World, that &s;uch Violences were prevented in all places: and that Men of &s;uch wicked Profe&s;&s;ion &s;hould be e&s;teemed for univer&s;al Enemies, and to have no other Quarter, nor Articles grant|ed them, than what we give to wild and hurtful Bea&s;ts, whom we de&s;troy by Snares and Gins, and all Advantages. The which al&s;o was never denied to the Venetians, whil&s;t they encountred and took them in the open Seas; but to enter into priviledged Places, and violate a Sanctuary of the Grand Signi|or's, without re&s;pect to the mighty Power of &s;o dreadful a Monarch, was an act &s;o in&s;o|lent, as could never obtain Pardon without due Compen&s;ation for the Offence; which could not be done, but either by a Re&s;titu|tion of the Ve&s;&s;els, or el&s;e of a like Num|ber in the places of them.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Hereunto the Bailo replied:</HI> <Q>That if an Accommodation could not be made on other Terms, nor Peace maintained, but by a &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to Pyrats, and &s;upportation of all their Injuries and Robberies, a War mu&s;t inevitably en&s;ue; for the good &s;ucce&s;s of which they depended on the Ble&s;&s;ing of God Almighty, and the general A&s;&s;i&s;tance of all Chri&s;tendom, which will e&s;teem it &s;elf uni|ver&s;ally concerned in this Cau&s;e, and obli|ged as well to make good this Quarrel a|gain&s;t Pirates, as to pre&s;erve <HI>Venice</HI> for their main Bulwark and Defence again&s;t the Otto|man Force.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You make me Smile (an&s;wered the Chi|macam) when you tell me of the Power of Chri&s;tendom, which contains nothing more of Terrour than the Name. Do not I know, who have been Pa&s;ha of <HI>Buda,</HI> that the Em|perour hath no Mony; and that when the Sweeds, a &s;mall and incon&s;iderable People, have made War upon him, they have almo&s;t over-run his Country? As for <HI>France,</HI> if they under&s;tand their own Politicks, they will &s;carce be per&s;waded to lend a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the Empire, when we make War again&s;t it. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> have &s;o much to do at Home, and to con&s;erve them&s;elves from the Incroachments of their powerful Neighbour the French, that they are wholly unable to lend Forces to wage a War at &s;uch a di|&s;tance from their Dominions. Wherefore con&s;idering the Advantage we have upon you, which we well know and under&s;tand; you mu&s;t either have War on the&s;e hazard|ous Terms, or el&s;e purcha&s;e your Peace with a con&s;iderable Sum of Mony. In ma|king of which Bargain you mu&s;t con&s;ider, that you have to deal with a mighty Prince, and not with a Merchant; and therefore your Offer ought to be large at fir&s;t, &s;o as it may gain Credit, and be received with a favourable Ear; for a &s;mall Sum to him is like a little Mor&s;el given to an hungry Sto|mach, which &s;erves only to increa&s;e the Ap|petite. And you know, that we our &s;elves are often forced to &s;acrifice to the Avarice of our Prince, by effu&s;ions of va&s;t Sums of Money, which are always be&s;t compounded for, when they are done readily, and at fir&s;t, before we give our Ma&s;ter time to con&s;ult with his Pillow, and to make up our Accounts according to the Calculation of his own Reckoning. Let me therefore exhort you to follow the like Example, and imme|diately make an Offer of three hundred thou|&s;and Zechins of Gold, which if you will do, and employ my Intere&s;t to make this Com|po&s;ition for you, I hope, though with &s;ome difficulty, to gain its acceptance. To talk and rea&s;on of Things pa&s;t is but to beat the Air, becau&s;e the time is vani&s;hed and gone; but you may con&s;ider of the pre&s;ent, that you may &s;ecure the future. We &s;ell you Peace at this Price; if it be worth your Mony, take it; if not, refu&s;e it, as you judge the Purcha&s;e mo&s;t agreeable to your Intere&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>At this time Chri&s;tendom was embroiled in its u&s;ual Combu&s;tions, &s;o that A&s;&s;i&s;tance from other Princes was not only uncertain, but without all Foundation; &s;o that the Venetians could have no &s;ure Tru&s;t to any other than their own Force. In regard that many were de&s;irous at that time to &s;ee the Venetians en|gaged with the Turk, that &s;o they might not be able to concern them&s;elves in the War of <HI>Italy,</HI> which then grew hot by rhe Wars of <HI>Savoy, Modena,</HI> and <HI>Matoua,</HI> favoured by the Protection of the Spaniards, by who&s;e means all the Differences aro&s;e about the Valtoline. Con&s;idering which, the wi&s;e Senate being wil|ling to purcha&s;e &s;o great a Ble&s;&s;ing to their Country by a moderate Price, gave Liberty to their Bailo to compound for it at what rate and terms he was able; which by the Bailo's Dexterity in the Management, was con|cluded for the Sum of two hundred and fif|ty thou&s;and Zechins, which was e&s;teemed for a great Service, and redounded much to the Reputation of the Bailo: after which Conclu|&s;ion, the former Articles were ratified, and the&s;e which follow added thereunto.</P>
<P><Q>That the Amba&s;&s;adour or Bailo &s;hould be &s;et at Liberty, and permitted to return to his own Habitation: That Commerce be renewed as formerly between the Subjects of both Countries: That all Controver&s;ie about the Maters happened at <HI>Valona,</HI> for ever be &s;ilenced and forgotten. When at any time the Pirats of <HI>Barbary</HI> &s;hall hap|pen to enter within the Ports of the Grand Signior, they &s;hall give Security, that they will commit no Damage or Spoil on the Subjects of <HI>Venice.</HI> And in ca&s;e they &s;hall have taken any Prizes belonging to the a|fore&s;aid State, they &s;hall not be admitted nor protected in the Ports belonging to the Grand Signior.

And farther, if the Venetians &s;hall at any time encounter the afore&s;aid People of <HI>Barbary</HI> in the open Sea, it &s;hall be lawful for them to a&s;&s;ault, take, and de&s;troy them without notice, or exceptions of the Ottoman Port.

<P>The Baron <HI>Chinski</HI> arrived at that time from the Emperour in Quality of Envoy Ex|traordinary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Envoy &s;ent from the Emperor to the Grand Signior.</NOTE> to congratulate the Grand Signi|or's Succe&s;s in taking <HI>Bagdat,</HI> and making a Peace with <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> but not bringing with him Pre|&s;ents to that value, which on this occa&s;ion were expected, he was not looked on, not con|&s;idered with that Favour and Re&s;pect, as was agreeable to his Character and Quality. And there happening a Di&s;pute between this Envoy and the Engli&s;h Amba&s;&s;adour concerning Pre|cedency of place; the Turks yielded it to the Engli&s;h, being made to under&s;tand the Diffe|rence which Chri&s;tian Princes make between the Title of an Amba&s;&s;adour and that of an Envoy, though the Turks u&s;e but that one word of <HI>Elchi</HI> to expre&s;s both.

And though &s;ome Italian Writers &s;ay, that the Engli&s;h Amba&s;&s;adour gave fifteen Pur|&s;es of Mony, or &s;even thou&s;and five hundred Dollars to the Chimacam for this Favour; yet tho&s;e who under&s;tand how unwillingly the <HI>Turky</HI>-Merchants part with their Mony on defence of &s;uch Punctillio's and Niceties, e&s;pecially where the Amba&s;&s;adour might have avoided the bringing them into Di&s;pute, will more readily believe, that the Turks from free motives of their own Ju&s;tice and Rea&s;on judged this Honour due to the Amba&s;&s;ador, than that he &s;hould purcha&s;e this indi&s;putable Point by the di&s;graceful means of Mony.</P>
<P>All matters being now determined between the Turks and <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and the black Clouds blown over from the Venetians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Turki&s;h Coun&s;els un|certain a|bout a War.</NOTE> the Grand Signior &s;tudied how and where he might turn his Arms with mo&s;t Advantage: he had con|ceived an irreconcileable pique again&s;t <HI>Ragotski</HI> and <HI>Matthew</HI> for the Cau&s;es before related; but having an intention to make u&s;e of their Force again&s;t <HI>Poland</HI> or <HI>Germany,</HI> or again&s;t them both together, he di&s;&s;embled the Pa&s;&s;ion he conceived again&s;t them, and rather defer|red his Revenge, than pardoned the Liberty which they had exerci&s;ed without his Licence or A&s;&s;ent. Sometimes he re&s;olved to recover <HI>A&s;ac</HI> out of the hands of the Co&s;&s;acks; &s;ome|times he thought of making War upon <HI>Po|land,</HI> judging him&s;elf much affronted by that King, for not &s;ending an Amba&s;&s;adour to con|gratulate his late Succe&s;&s;es: Then he &s;uppo|&s;ed, that a War in <HI>Germany</HI> would be more ea&s;ie, and the Conque&s;t more profitable by rea|&s;on of the Riches of the People, and the Fer|tility of the Soil, to which pretences could never be wanting on the &s;core of tho&s;e Dif|ferences which always ari&s;e among&s;t the Peo|ple of the Frontiers. During the&s;e Debates and Coun&s;els, Preparations were made for War both by Sea and Land, as yet uncertain where they &s;hould be imployed:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Vizier returns from <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></NOTE> To command them the Great Vizier was ordered to ha&s;ten his Journey from <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> who&s;e Arrival was celebrated at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> with a &s;olemn En|try; and for a particular and di&s;tingui&s;hing Honour, the Grand Signior &s;ent him a Ve&s;t from his own Back to wear on the day of his Triumph. This Vizier was a Per&s;on very au|&s;tere in his Behaviour, bold and valiant, as he evidenced by his Actions in taking <HI>Bag|dat,</HI> zealous for his Ma&s;ter's Intere&s;t; and, what is rare in a Turk, not much addicted to his own: He had acquired a great &s;hare in the E&s;teem of his Ma&s;ter, and his Authori|ty increa&s;ed, as the daily Decay of the Grand Signior's Health rendred him le&s;s able for Go|vernment. For now the &s;trong Complexion of <HI>Morat</HI> began to grow feeble by exce&s;&s;es of fre|quent Debauchery, his Stomach was become cold and weak, not able to dige&s;t the lighte&s;t Meats, his hand &s;hook, and a paralytical Di|&s;temper &s;eized him in every part; &s;o that his Mother and the Phy&s;icians per&s;waded him to for&s;ake the u&s;e of Wine, as Poy&s;on and De|&s;truction to his Health; and he, whil&s;t he was &s;en&s;ible of his langui&s;hing Condition, like a true Penitent, made many Prote&s;tations and Vows again&s;t it, forbidding the accur&s;ed Poy|&s;on to be received within the Walls of the Seraglio: How&s;oever his kind Heart could not po&s;&s;ibly with&s;tand the Temptation of a Ban|quet, to which his Pot-companions did &s;ome|times invite him; among&s;t which the Great Vizier would not be wanting al&s;o to plea&s;e and cajole the Humour of his Ma&s;ter with the Liquor that he loved. But his chief and con|&s;tant Camerades in drinking were his Per&s;ian Favourite, and <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> Pa&s;ha of <HI>Bo&s;na,</HI> one educated in the Seraglio, promoted to the place of Selictar Aga, to whom he gave the &s;tately Palace of <HI>Ibrahim</HI> Pa&s;ha on the <HI>Hippo|drome,</HI> together with his elde&s;t Daughter in Marriage. The&s;e two &s;tout Sons of <HI>Bacchus</HI> per&s;waded the Grand Signior to appoint one &s;olemn Drinking-day in time of the Biram, which is the great Fe&s;tival of the Year, and introduced by their Prophet in imitation of our <HI>Ea&s;ter. Morat</HI> being at this time po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed with the Spirit of Debauchery, accepted the Motion, and invited the two Drunkards to dinner with him. The Per&s;ian provoked his Plea&s;ure of drinking by &s;alt Meats, and by peppered and &s;piced Di&s;hes; the &s;ort of Wine they mo&s;t u&s;ed, was a &s;weet Malvoi&s;ia, &s;ometimes twi&s;ted, and encouraged with the &s;trong Waters, called <HI>Ro&s;a Solis,</HI> of which they &s;ucked &s;o long, and with &s;uch Exce&s;s, that falling under the force of it, they were in&s;en&s;ibly carried away to their &s;everal Beds. This di&s;&s;olute Repa&s;t became fatal to the Grand Signior; for a Fire being kindled in his Veins and Bowels, he fell into a violent and continued Feaver. The Phy&s;icians being called, were fearful to admini&s;ter Remedies, le&s;t proving un&s;ucce&s;sful, their Lives &s;hould pay for the ineffectual Operation: At length they agreed to let him blood,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The death of Sultan <HI>Morat.</HI></NOTE> but this ha&s;te|ned his Death. For he died the fourth Day of his Feaver, being the <HI>8th</HI> of <HI>February,</HI> in the &s;eventeenth Year of his Reign, and the one and thirtieth of his Age, having ruled in the height of all Di&s;orders and irregular Ex|ce&s;&s;es,

He was very inqui&s;itive into all Actions of the City, for which he maintained his Spies, and oftentimes took his Rules and Mea&s;ures from Di&s;cour&s;es of People concerning his Government. He was a great Di&s;&s;embler, ready, active, and revengeful, covetous to Ex|tremity, having left fiteen Millions of Gold in his Trea&s;ury, which was empty when he en|tred upon the Soveraignty. In &s;hort, he was &s;o bad, that he had &s;carce any Allay of Ver|tue; being &s;o great a Tyrant, that at length he became his own A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate, and fell unla|mented by all but the two Companions of his be&s;tial Exce&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>THE REIGN OF Sultan IBRAHIM, TWELFTH EMPEROR OF THE TURKS.</HEAD>
<P><HI>S&V;ltan Amurath,</HI> or <HI>Morat,</HI> after a Fever of eight Days continuance, cau&s;ed by an exce&s;s of Debauchery in Wine, having on the eighth of <HI>February,</HI> 1640, ac|cording to the New-Stile, expired his la&s;t Breath.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid.</HI> the Ott. State.</NOTE> His Mother, called <HI>Kio&s;em,</HI> comforted her &s;elf with the thoughts thather Son <HI>Sultan Ibrahim</HI> &s;till lived, and was the &s;ole Surviver, and undoubted Heir of the Ottoman Family. To who&s;e Succe&s;&s;ion, that &s;he might make the more facile and undi&s;turbed Entrance, &s;he con|&s;ulted with all the Viziers, reque&s;ting their Con&s;ent and A&s;&s;i&s;tance, in the lawful promotion of her remaining Son to the Throne of his An|ce&s;tors: For &s;he had under&s;tood, that <HI>Morat,</HI> who always abhorred the ill-&s;hap'd Body, and weaker Mind of his Brother, envied him the Dignity of the Ottoman Scepter, and there|fore had bequeathed the Succe&s;&s;ion to the Tartar, having, in the Heat of a Debauch, and Fumes of Wine, compelled his Pa&s;ha's to &s;wear to the performance of his Te&s;tament.</P>
<P>Wherefore the Queen, a&s;&s;embling them toge|ther, with gentle Words, de&s;ired them to re|member, That <HI>Ibrahim</HI> was the Lawful Heir, and their true Emperor; that the Tartar <HI>Han</HI> was a Stranger, odious to the Souldiery, and not beloved by the People: that an Alteration of this Nature could never be contrived and exe|cuted, without danger to the Actors; and that they, to whom &s;he a&s;&s;ured the continuance of the &s;ame Honours and Offices, in Reward of their con|&s;tant Allegiance, would be in hazard of lo&s;ing all, by the coming of a Foreign Prince, who having Confidents of his own to prefer, and grand Nece&s;&s;ities to &s;atisfy, would make bold even with E&s;tates and Provinces to prefer his Fa|vorites, his Kindred, and Country-Men, and e&s;tabli&s;h the firmne&s;s of his Government on their Ruin. Yet, &s;etting a&s;ide tho&s;e Con&s;iderations, touching their own Safety and Intere&s;t, &s;he pro|mi&s;ed, That if they would reach out their Hands unto her Son, for to lift him unto the Throne, he &s;hould acknowledg his Empire from them, and accordingly love, tender, and e&s;teem &s;uch faithful Subjects.</P>
<P>The Viziers, after &s;ome Reflections on the Tye and Obligation which Sultan <HI>Morat</HI> had cau&s;ed them to make to him, declared, and pub|li&s;hed it to be unlawful, and void; prote&s;ting, That they were re&s;olved to maintain inviolable the Allegiance they owed unto Sultan <HI>Ibrahim,</HI> de&s;cended from the Ottoman Blood, which they reverenced and adored, with an Awe equal to the Religious E&s;teem which their Fore-fathers had of it; and therefore, with one Voice they cried out, <HI>Let Sultan</HI> Ibrahim <HI>live.</HI></P>
<P>Herewith the Council breaking up, the Vi|ziers, accompanied with all the Officers and At|tendants of the Seraglio, went with Shouts and loud Acclamations, to the Pri&s;on of <HI>Ibrahim,</HI> to &s;alute him Emperor; for he, poor Prince, had now for four Years remained a &s;ad Reclu&s;e in a dark Room, where he had received neither Light nor Air, but what came from a little Window, which &s;ometimes in favour was opened to him from Above; and what was wor&s;e, the conti|nual expectations, and fear of Death, without Friends, Conver&s;ation, or Hope, rendred tho&s;e Apprehen&s;ions wor&s;e than Death it &s;elf; which daily were repre&s;ented to him in that Solemnity, as might terrify a Mind more con&s;tant and firm than his.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as he heard the Shouts and Voices of a Multitude near his Door, he immediately con|ceived, that the Fate was now come which he had &s;o long expected, and therefore he barred his Door, and denied to give Entrance: And when the Viziers proclaimed him Emperor, (fearing it might be &s;ome Artifice of his Brother,
<PB N="50" REF="28">to &s;ee with what Joy he would entertain the News) he an&s;wered, That he did not &s;o much as think of the Empire, nor de&s;ire it, but only prayed that Sultan <HI>Morat</HI> might live, to whom he pretended not to be a Brother, but a Slave: And when he perceived that they began to force the Door, though with terms of Re&s;pect and Ob&s;ervance, he &s;till endeavoured to keep it clo&s;e; for Nature had taught him to con&s;erve a Life, for Nature had taught him to con&s;erve a Life, how&s;oever Mi&s;erable, and void of Con&s;o|lation.</P>
<P>He continuing thus re&s;olute not to open, Re|verence to his Per&s;on commanded them to for|bear any ruder Violence; until the Queen-Mother over-hearing all this Stir, de&s;cended her &s;elf in Per&s;on; and fir&s;t cau&s;ing the dead Corps of Sul|tan <HI>Morat</HI> to be extended before his Door, with gentle Compellations, and confident A&s;&s;urances, averred the Death of his Brother. The Voice of his Mother began to di&s;&s;ipate the Fears, and being in part already convinced by his Ears, he adventured to peep at the Door, and giving then entire Credence to his Eyes, his Heart and Spirits con&s;ented to revive; and &s; retiring back into his Chamber, he willingly received the Congratulations of the Mini&s;ters and Souldiers; which being pa&s;t, he readily applied his Shoul|ders to the Coffin of his dead Brother; and having bore his &s;hare of that dear Burden to the Gate of the Seraglio, he there re&s;igned it to his Dome&s;tick Officers, who buried him in the Sepulchre of Sultan <HI>Achmet.</HI></P>
<P>From thence he took Boat, and pa&s;&s;ed to the Mo&s;ch of <HI>Jub</HI>'s Seraglio, where in the &s;pace of eight days, he compleated all the Ceremonies of his Coronation; and afterwards, according to the Cu&s;tom of his Ance&s;tors, he rode through the City to his great Palace; but whether it were for want of practice, or by rea&s;on of a Po&s;ture natural unto Fools, he fat &s;o ridiculou&s;ly on his Saddle, as moved rather the Laughter than the Acclamation of the People.</P>
<P>In fine, being entred the Seraglio, he began to breath, and enjoy the Air of Liberty, with &s;o much contentment and &s;atisfaction, that he un|willingly would empair the lea&s;t Particle of his late acquired Freedom, by thinking, or attend|ing to Bu&s;ine&s;s, and as if he enjoyed &s;ufficient, committed all to the management of his Mother; how&s;oever, being de&s;irous to handle &s;omething of the Government, he did it with &s;o little Grace and Dexterity, that it plainly appeared, that that Soul animated a Body not fit to &s;way or wield a Scepter.</P>
<P>The Queen-Mother, to maintain the Word &s;he had given to the Viziers, continued them all in their re&s;pective Offices; &s;o that, though there was great di&s;proportion in the Mind of the two Princes, yet the Mini&s;ters being the &s;ame, there &s;eemed to be little or no Alteration in the Government.</P>
<P>The Great Vizier remembring well the thoughts of War which Sultan <HI>Morat</HI> meditated again&s;t the Co&s;&s;acks, and being de&s;irous of Glo|ry, and continuance of his Power, re&s;olved to pro&s;ecute the &s;ame De&s;ign, hoping to meet a Spirit in <HI>Ibrahim</HI> equal to the Genero&s;ity of his Brother.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rea&s;ons for a War with the Co&s;&s;aks.</NOTE> To this War many and various were the Motives; as fir&s;t, A natural de&s;ire of Revenge on the Co&s;&s;acks, for having infe&s;ted the Black Seas, that they might thereby provoke <HI>Poland</HI> to a War, which when they had reduced to &s;ome Extremity, the Emperor would con&s;equent|ly fall in to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and thereby create Quarrels, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily open a large Field of Troubles; which being &s;own with the Seed of Di&s;cord, could not fail to produce Cau|&s;es and Pretentions for a War.</P>
<P>It being thus re&s;olved, to which the Vizier nei|ther wanted Eloquence nor Rea&s;ons to per&s;wade, great Preparations were made for a War, which was intended to be maintained for many Years: During which time, God, who di&s;po&s;es all Things at his Plea&s;ure, permitted a fal&s;e Report to fly, that the Per&s;ians were providing a great Army to be&s;iege <HI>Bagdat;</HI> to which the Turks giving entire Credence, it was re&s;olved in the Divan, that tho&s;e Preparations again&s;t Chri&s;ten|dom, &s;hould be diverted towards the Parts of the Ea&s;tern Countries. By this vain Rumour only were all the&s;e Grand De&s;igns di&s;appointed, and all farther Thoughts vani&s;hed for the pre|&s;ent of mole&s;ting the Chri&s;tians. From whence it is ob&s;ervable, how nece&s;&s;ary are the Foreign Re&s;idences of Mini&s;ters, and how ab&s;urdly the Turks err; who, by rea&s;on of their Pride, vouch&s;afe not to entertain Amba&s;&s;adors in the Courts of Strangers, being beholden to the Jews, or Armenian-Merchants for all their Intel|ligence they receive touching the Affairs of Neighbouring Kingdoms.</P>
<P>The Wars being thus &s;u&s;pended, the Great Vizier had time to ca&s;t his Eyes about him, and contrive the Ruin of &s;uch whom he &s;u&s;pected mo&s;t dangerous to his Condition. Among&s;t the re&s;t, none appeared more formidable than <HI>Mu|&s;tapha</HI> Pa&s;ha, Captain-Pa&s;ha, a young brisk Per|&s;on, and Favourite of the Queen-Mother, whom to remove was difficult and dangerous, being a Vizier as well as he, and in one of the mo&s;t emi|nent Degrees of Dignity in the whole Empire: And therefore that he might touch him with &s;mooth and gentle Terms, he practi&s;ed upon him the ordinary Decoy of Preferment, prof|fering him the Government of <HI>Buda;</HI> which whil&s;t the one &s;eemed out of mode&s;ty to refu&s;e, the other with the greater force of Complement, and obliging expre&s;&s;ions of Friend&s;hip, pre&s;&s;ed him to accept. At length, overcome with im|portunity and kindne&s;s, <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> received the Proffer; whereby being dive&s;ted of the Queen's Protection, he was &s;oon after overtaken in his Journey towards his Principality, and by ano|ther Mandate required to take his way to the Province of <HI>Sili&s;tria,</HI> the &s;malle&s;t, and mo&s;t in|con&s;iderable of the Empire: in which he was no &s;ooner inve&s;ted, than a &s;econd Edict took off his Head.</P>
<P>But another <HI>Mu&s;tapha,</HI> more fortunate, was &s;ent Pa&s;ha to <HI>Grand Cairo</HI> in <HI>Aegypt;</HI> he was a mortal Enemy to the <HI>Crim Tartar,</HI> of whom he &s;hewed his hatred at <HI>Rhodes,</HI> by putting his Son to Death, for having &s;aid, That Sultan <HI>Morat,</HI> and Sultan <HI>Ibrahim</HI> dying without I&s;&s;ue, the Em|pire was to de&s;cend to his Family. This Son of Tartar was then at <HI>Rhodes,</HI> it being a Cu&s;tom al|ways to have one of them as a Ho&s;tage for the Father's obedient Comportment towards the Turks, their place of Re&s;idence being either at <HI>Rhodes,</HI> or &s;ome Town on the Black Sea, as we have el&s;ewhere declared.</P>
<P>The Sultan in this Interim had little regard un|to the Government, both for want of Capacity, and by rea&s;on of his luxurious and wanton Ap|petite, the which he indulged in the highe&s;t ex|ce&s;s of Sen&s;uality; for having been accu&s;tomed to a Pri&s;on, and Re&s;traint, he knew not how to enjoy that freedom he had recovered, but by &s;ubjecting it to the imperious &s;ervitude of his Lu&s;ts. This Humor the Vizier and great Mi|ni&s;ters cheri&s;hed in him, by continual Banquets, Fea&s;s, and Entertainments, in which he always
<PB N="51" REF="28">took high contentment and &s;atisfaction. His other Recreations were, Hor&s;e-races, and Shoot|ing with the Bow, rewarding the mo&s;t dexte|rous Archers. Bu&s;ine&s;s was a Stranger to him, he knew not what it meant, nor thought there was other Employment for the Emperor than to &s;tudy tho&s;e Pa&s;times, which mo&s;t corre&s;ponded with his Youth and Nature: only the Vizier would &s;ometimes, in Matters of high Impor|tance, demand his A&s;&s;ent, which was either out of formality, or el&s;e to &s;ecure him&s;elf with the Name and Authority of his Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>The News of Sultan <HI>Ibrahim</HI>'s promotion to the Throne being arrived at <HI>Venice,</HI> the mo&s;t &s;erene Republick di&s;patched <HI>Pietro Fo&s;carini</HI> as their Amba&s;&s;ador Extraordinary to complement the Sultan.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Amba&s;&s;a|dors &s;ent to complement Sultan <HI>Ib|rahim</HI></NOTE> The Prince of <HI>Tran&s;ylvania</HI> in like manner &s;ent his Tribute, which was &s;ome Hawks, and twelve Ve&s;&s;els of Gilded Plate, as feudatary Acknowledgments for the Lands held, and for his Confirmation in the Principality.</P>
<P>The Mini&s;ters of other Princes having pa&s;&s;ed the like Addre&s;&s;es, which were cu&s;tomary, the Amba&s;&s;adors of <HI>Poland</HI> made Complaints of the Tartars, who&s;e Incur&s;ions again&s;t them, the Turks, by Conditions of Peace, were obliged to re&s;train; but in this, as in other Occa&s;ions &s;ince that time, the Poles could obtain no Re|dre&s;s from the Turks, who willing to have the Chri&s;tians oppre&s;&s;ed or ruined, either &s;eem|ed not to give Credit to the Subject of Com|plaints, or el&s;e to find out Excu&s;es to acquit the Tartar; which being &s;o known and common a Practice with the Turk, it is to be wondred why the Poles have &s;ent &s;o many late Me&s;&s;ages of this Nature, which in former, as well as in this pre&s;ent Age, have proved fruitle&s;s; a pregnant Example of which we &s;hall find in the Reign of Sultan <HI>Mahomet,</HI> Son of this <HI>Ibrahim.</HI></P>
<P>Among&s;t other Corruptions the&s;e Times, A&s;pers were &s;o cut and clipt, that the Dollar ro&s;e from eighty to an hundred and twenty A|&s;pers; which Irregularity being complained of in the Divan, all Monies were reduced to their intrin&s;ick Value; and the A&s;pers called in to be coined in the Mint, to the great Damage of the People.</P>
<P>But this Matter will not appear &s;trange, if it be compared to the Vellion of <HI>Spain,</HI> and to the Permi&s;&s;ion in <HI>Turkey,</HI> of the ba&s;e Alloy of Te|mins, by which never any Nation before was ever &s;o cheated and abu&s;ed.</P>
<P>And now the Storms of War, which threat|ned from <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> being blown over, it was judged &s;ea&s;onable to rea&s;&s;ume the thoughts of War &s;o long meditated again&s;t the Co&s;&s;acks: In order unto which, Gallies were commanded to be built, which &s;hould draw little Water, and purpo&s;ely made to pa&s;s the Shoals on the Black Sea near <HI>A&s;ac,</HI> for the recovery of that Place out of the Hands of the Enemy. Another Squa|dron al&s;o of Gallies was de&s;igned for the <HI>Archi|pelago,</HI> to oppo&s;e the Gallies of <HI>Malta</HI> and <HI>Na|ples,</HI> which much infe&s;ted tho&s;e Seas.</P>
<P>To the fir&s;t Enterpri&s;e, the Tartar much ex|cited the Turk, by rea&s;on that <HI>A&s;ac</HI> did not on|ly hinder his Incur&s;ions by Land, but rendred his Navigation in the Black Seas very un&s;ecure. To the &s;econd, The Gallies of <HI>Malta</HI> much pro|voked them, under the Command of <HI>Frederick</HI> the Landgrave of <HI>He&s;&s;e;</HI> who by the Per&s;wa|&s;ions of the Cardinals of <HI>Savoy,</HI> and <HI>Barberini,</HI> from a Prote&s;tant was become a Roman Catho|lick, and had obtained the great Cro&s;s of <HI>Malta;</HI> and with &s;everal Gallies and Ships, performed &s;ome Exploits at <HI>Bi&s;erta,</HI> and at the <HI>Golletta</HI> near <HI>Tunis.</HI></P>
<P>The Year 1641 being now entered, the Sul|tan pa&s;&s;ed a mo&s;t Luxurious Life in his Seraglio, con&s;uming an immen&s;e Trea&s;ure on his Women; and whil&s;t whe&s;e two Fleets were preparing to proceed on their re&s;pective Expedition, that in|tended for <HI>A&s;ac</HI> had almo&s;t been diverted by the Rumors and Di&s;turbances on the Frontiers of <HI>Hungary;</HI> but they were &s;oon afterwards ap|pea&s;ed, by an appearance of an Envoy from the Emperor, and return of a Chiaus to <HI>Vienna,</HI> with Ratification of all the former Articles and Conditions of Peace. How&s;oever the German Internuncio was braved at the Port, for not ap|pearing &s;ooner with his Pre&s;ents and Comple|ments of Congratulation, for the happy En|trance of Sultan <HI>Ibrahim</HI> to the Ottoman Throne; &s;o apt are the Turks to believe Acts of Civility, or Ceremony, to be Parts of Obedi|ence and Submi&s;&s;ion; and what Chri&s;tians have once given them voluntarily, is afterwards ex|acted as a Matter of Debt or Duty.</P>
<P>And being thus freed from a Su&s;picion of Troubles in <HI>Hungary,</HI> and exempted from the Fears of waging two Wars at once, (which the Turks always &s;tudiou&s;ly avoid) they di&s;patched a Letter into <HI>Poland,</HI> to demand pa&s;&s;age for their Army, through that Country, to the Siege of <HI>A&s;ac;</HI> but that not being con&s;ented unto; the Turks prepared to open their way by Force, and the Poles to defend the Pa&s;&s;age. In which interim, many Di&s;a&s;ters concurred, &s;ufficient to di&s;courage the Turks in their De&s;ign; who are a People, that &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly calculate the Suc|ce&s;s of their Enterpri&s;es, by the difficulty or &s;mooth &s;ucce&s;s of their fir&s;t beginnings: For when the Vizier was ready to depart, a dreadful Fire happened in <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> to the quench|ing of which, applying not only his Orders, but his own Per&s;on; he adventured &s;o far, that he burned both his Hands, and &s;inged his Beard in that manner, that he was forced to take his Bed for &s;everal Days, where he was honoured with a Vi&s;it of the Sultan.</P>
<P>News al&s;o came at the &s;ame time, that <HI>Tauris,</HI> or <HI>Ecbatan,</HI> on the Borders of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> was mi|&s;erably ruin'd by an Earthquake; and what was wor&s;e, the Sultan him&s;elf was &s;eized with an Apoplexy, which turned to a Paralytical Di&s;tem|per, the Cau&s;e whereof was attributed to his exce&s;&s;ive u&s;e of Women; to whom he was &s;o immoderately addicted, that he con&s;umed his Days and Nights in their Apartments. This Di&s;ea&s;e, which is rarely or never cured, being joined to a Report given out by his Ladies, that notwith&s;tanding his Venereal Heat, he was yet Impotent as to Women; created a Belief, or at lea&s;t a &s;trong probability, that he might die without I&s;&s;ue, which cau&s;ed high Confu&s;ion in the Coun&s;els of the Grandees, that no De&s;ign could make any chearful Progre&s;s, until Provi|&s;ion was fir&s;t made for Supply of the Ottoman Hou&s;e; for the Succe&s;&s;ion of the Tartar was in no manner convenient or &s;ecure; but rather that the Throne &s;hould be furni&s;hed with the Son of a Si&s;ter, or of a Niece, than to &s;ubject them|&s;elves to the Rule and Pa&s;&s;ions of a Foreign Prince. And though the Sultan did afterwards recover his Health, yet all &s;u&s;pected and feared, that by the immoderate Heat of his Veneri I In|clination, he would die without Children; eve|ry one di&s;cour&s;ing, as moved by his Pa&s;&s;ion, or his Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>About this time arrived an Amba&s;&s;ador at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> from the Soft&aacute; of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> bringing a Rati&s;ication of the Peace; who was &s;o much the more welcome, by how much more the pre&s;ent
<PB N="52" REF="29">Conjuncture rendred it advantagious; and being u&s;hered in with exceeding rich Pre&s;ents, ravi&s;hed the Hearts of the Turks, who&s;e good Nature melts and di&s;&s;olves with the &s;ight or hopes of Gifts.</P>
<P>In <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> near the Con&s;ines of <HI>Zara,</HI> the Turks made Incur&s;ions on the Venetian Terri|tories, and cau&s;ed &s;ome Di&s;turbances: but being cha&s;ti&s;ed by an Ambu&s;h laid for them, whereby about two hundred of them peri&s;hed; all Mat|ters were again reconciled, and the Peace re|newed.</P>
<P>And now one would imagine, that the De|&s;ign again&s;t <HI>A&s;ac,</HI> by &s;uch diver&s;ity of Ob&s;tructi|ons, were ab&s;olutely laid a&s;ide; which though they were of that Importance, and e&s;pecially the fear of <HI>Ibrahim</HI>'s Death, to detain the Vi|zier at Home; yet he thought fit to pro&s;ecute the De&s;ign under the command of the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Sili&s;tria,</HI> to whom he had committed the Con|duct of this War.</P>
<P>The Pa&s;ha proud of his Charge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Siege of <HI>A&s;ac.</HI></NOTE> rejoiced to be imployed in a War, wherein he apprehended &s;o little difficulty, and progno&s;ticated to him&s;elf nothing but Glory and Victory; e&s;teemed the Defendants for no other than Fi&s;hermen, and better experienccd to &s;ail their Boats, and go|vern their Saiks in the Black Seas, than to draw up an Army in the Field, or defend their Walls. This Confidence was farther increa&s;ed, by an Emba&s;&s;y at the &s;ame time from the Mo&s;covite, who not only renounced all A&s;&s;i&s;tance or Con|cernment for that Town, but renewed with them his Friend&s;hip, and Articles of ancient Agree|ment.</P>
<P>The Ottoman Army, be&s;ides Jani&s;aries, and other Turks, con&s;i&s;ted of Moldavians, and Wa|lachians, and a great number of Tartars, which at fir&s;t entred into their Trenches, and be&s;ieged the Town; but here they re&s;ted not &s;ecurely, by rea&s;on of the frequent Sallies the Be&s;ieged made upon them; and more e&s;pecially by the Mines which they &s;prang, to the terror and damage of their Enemies. The Turks moved hereat, made furious A&s;&s;aults, but were as valiantly repul&s;ed by the Defendants, who threw &s;calding Water, and Pitch, and burning Sulphur upon the A&s;&s;ai|lants; &s;o that not being able to take the Town by Force, they retired to their Trenches, and deliberated in what manner, by fair Promi&s;es, and Mony; they might invite them to Surren|der. Hereupon the Captain-Pa&s;ha, the Tartar <HI>Han,</HI> and others, tried the Efficacy of large Proffers of Priviledges to the Town, their Country, and Inhabitants; with a Gratuity of twelve thou&s;and Hungers of Gold: But the&s;e Promi&s;es could make no more entrance into their Hearts, than the Turks could do into their Walls, which they &s;eemed re&s;olute to defend, wanting neither Provi&s;ion, nor Ammunition, nor courage for the War: but on the contrary &s;ide, all the&s;e were wanting in the Turki&s;h Camp; &s;o that fifteen days pa&s;&s;ed without any Action, until they were &s;upplied by the arrival of cer|tain Brigantines, and light Ve&s;&s;els, di&s;patched with all expedition with the nece&s;&s;aries of War: At the coming of which, the Turkds prepared for another A&s;&s;ault, which they continued un|ce&s;&s;antly for the &s;pace of &s;even days, but were received with that vigour by the Be&s;ieged, that they could not gain one palm or inch of ground; So that at length with di&s;grace, and di&s;courage|ment, they were forced to give over their At|tempt, de&s;pairing to gain the Town in the time, and with the Force which was allotted for this Enterprize.</P>
<P>With this ill Succe&s;s, Extremity and Famine pinched the Turks in their Trenches &s;o much, that an Ox was &s;old for fifteen Zechins, a Lamb for three, and a Mea&s;ure of Barley, which fer|ved a Hor&s;e for one time, for a Dollar; &s;o that at length they were forced to rai&s;e the Siege; and the Captain Pa&s;ha, by tempe&s;tuous Weather, was con&s;trained to &s;helter his Fleet in the Port of <HI>Caffa.</HI> In their return Home, the General was fearful of having forfeited his Head; the Commanders were &s;ilent, and a&s;hamed of their Succe&s;s, and the Souldlers di&s;couraged, fami&s;hed, and poor; for they had lo&s;t three thou&s;and Spa|hees, &s;even thou&s;and Jani&s;aries, and eight hun|dred other Souldiers, be&s;ides Moldavians, Wa|lachians, and Tartars; tho&s;e that &s;urvived of the Foot were naked, and many &s;ick; the Spa|hees were without Hor&s;es, with which they were &s;upplied by the Tartars; and in fine, &s;o un&s;uc|ce&s;sful were all Matters, that the Veteran Soul|diery avouched, that they never endured a more cruel, nor a more mi&s;erable War.</P>
<P>And now we &s;hall end this Year 1641,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ju&s;t pu|ni&s;hment of a Per&s;ian Traytor.</NOTE> with the ruin of <HI>Emir Guimir,</HI> a Per&s;ian by Birth, a Favourite, and yet Traitor to his Natural Prince.

Sultan <HI>Morat</HI> afterwards be&s;towed a magnificent Seraglio upon him, &s;ituated on the <HI>Bo&s;phorus,</HI> enriched him with a va&s;t Trea&s;ury, and what is more, with his Favour, making him his Companion in his Pa&s;times, and his Confident in his &s;erious Coun|&s;els: It was he that fir&s;t per&s;waded the Sultan to drink Wine, in which both of them were bea&s;t|ly intemperate, and mighty and valiant to bear, until the heat thereof having extingui&s;hed the natural heat of their Stomachs, it became too cold and crude, unle&s;s corrected, or fortified with Rach, or di&s;tilled Spirits.

<P>And now,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Birth of Sultan <HI>Mahomet.</HI></NOTE> to give farther Courage to the Pro|&s;ecution of higher Attempts, the whole Tur|ki&s;h Empire was repleni&s;hed with Joy, for the Birth of a young Prince Sultan <HI>Mahomet,</HI> that now reigns; &s;o that the &s;uppo&s;ed Impotency of the Father (whereby the Ottoman Family might have been extingui&s;hed) was proved otherwi&s;e by plain Effect; and the fear of tho&s;e that ru|led the Empite vai&s;hing by the Ri&s;ing of this new Star, all places were filled with Joy and Triumphs; only the Tartar <HI>Han</HI> finding him&s;elf thus di&s;appointed, was <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> not willing to concur heartily in this common Joy.

<P>The new Pa&s;ha of <HI>Sili&s;tria</HI> thus taking upon him&s;elf the Command of the Army, and Con|duct of this War, a&s;&s;embled a Force of <HI>Turks, Tartars, Moldavians,</HI> and <HI>Walachians,</HI> far exceed|ing the number of the la&s;t Year. At the News of which, and of the Fleet of Gallies de&s;igned to be&s;iege them by Sea, they apprehended their Danger &s;o great, that without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Mo&s;covite, they concluded it impo&s;&s;ible to defend their City; to him therefore they made Applications for Succour, repre&s;enting unto him the extremity their Affairs were in, by rea&s;on of that powerful Enemy which threatned them; and that having always acknowledged him for their Protector, there was no Refuge left them but under the defence of his Arms. But hereun|to the Mo&s;covite gave a brief reply, That he had lately concluded Peace with the Turk; &s;ince which, having received from him no occa&s;ion of breach, he could not with any Ju&s;tice engage &s;o &s;oon again&s;t him in a War.</P>

This gentle Treatment recalled many back to their Homes, &s;o hardly are Men weaned from their Native Country; and in a &s;hort time the City beginning to fill, all Matters &s;eemed to re|turn to their pri&s;tine State and Condition.</P>
<P>About this time the Per&s;ian,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Per&s;ian renews his League.</NOTE> by his Amba&s;&s;a|dor, renewed his League with the Turk, and confirmed it in the Name of the new king; which was performed on condition that the <HI>Soft</HI> &s;hould demoli&s;h the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Fortrina,</HI> which he had, contrary to Articles, built on the Fron|tiers, not far from the Ca&s;pian Sea; which that it might a&s;&s;uredly be performed, a Capugibathee was di&s;patched to &s;ee it effected.</P>

<P>This Year 1643 being entered, the Prince of <HI>Tran&s;ylvania</HI> conveyed his Annual Tribute, be|ing ten thou&s;and Zechins, to the Port; which when the Agents of that Prince pre&s;ented before the Vizier, he &s;eemingly refu&s;ed it; pretending that the compleat Tribute was to be fifteen thou&s;and, according to Agreement: but the A|gents replied, that five thou&s;and had been re|mitted unto <HI>Bethlem Gabor,</HI> not by way of Gra|tuity or Recompence for his Service, but in Ex|change, or as the price of two Cities, which the Prince had yielded to the Sultan, out of his own proper E&s;tate in <HI>Hungary:</HI> With which An&s;wer the Vizier remained &s;atisfied, being jealous of the Turbulent and active Spirit of that Prince.</P>
<P>During all the&s;e Wars and Revolutions in Kingdoms and States, Sultan <HI>Ibrahim</HI> contained and contented him&s;elf within the Precincts of his Seraglio; where becoming a faithful and va|liant Soldier of <HI>Venus,</HI> he con&s;umed more Trea|sure in that War, than his Brother <HI>Morat</HI> did in Foreign Conque&s;ts; and being, as it were, en|tered into the Mahometan Paradi&s;e, where the Company of fair Women is the chiefe&s;t Felicity promi&s;ed, he laboured to increa&s;e the Ottoman Family, and to acquit his People of the appre|hen&s;ion they had of wanting an Heir to &s;ucceed in the Throne; &s;o that on the <HI>15th</HI> of <HI>February</HI> he had a &s;econd Son born, and a third on the <HI>12th</HI> of <HI>March</HI> following; which ab&s;olutely took away the Reproach of his Frigidity or Impo|tence, proving afterwards the mo&s;t la&s;civious and devout Sultan that ever a&s;pired to the Ma|hometan Heaven.</P>
<P>This Year the Turks armed out twenty Gal|lies more than u&s;ual, be&s;ides thirty Sail of Ships, and Gally-Gro&s;&s;es; in the beginning of <HI>June,</HI> riding at the Seraglio Point (where the Com|manders in Chief came to take their leave of Sultan <HI>Ibrahim</HI>) they divided into two Squa|drons; one of which con&s;i&s;ting of twenty Gal|lies, under the Command of <HI>Beker</HI> Pa&s;ha, took their Voyage into the Black Sea; the remainder under the Captain Pa&s;ha, &s;ailed for <HI>Cyprus,</HI> with intention to do Ju&s;tice on the Pa&s;ha of that I&s;land, who&s;e Riches gained by Oppre&s;&s;ion, had de|bauched him from due Obedience towards his Prince; and being arrived there, without Rumor or Noi&s;e, giving &s;igns of good Will and Re|&s;pects towards the Pa&s;ha, one day he &s;ent to in|vite him Aboard to banquet with him; where the Pa&s;ha fooli&s;hly coming, and having well eaten and drank with him, his Entertainment had not time time to dige&s;t, before he breathed his La&s;t; for being on his departure, the Slaves a&s;&s;aulted him, and &s;trangled him by Order of the Captain|Pa&s;ha.</P>
<P>No other Matters remarkable did the Turki&s;h Fleet perform this Year at Sea, before they re|turned again to their Winter-Quarters.

<P>And now the Year 1644 being begun, <HI>Ra|gotski,</HI> who was never contented but in Combu|&s;tions, and never at. ea&s;e but when he was proving new Projects, made Demands of certain Places on the Confines of <HI>Moravia,</HI> &s;cituated within the Mountains, which he challenged as the Inheritance of his Son; be&s;ides other Pre|tences which he made in right of <HI>Bethlem Gabor.</HI> To forward which De&s;igns, moved with an in|veterate Enmity to the Au&s;trian Family, he en|deavoured to win the Hearts of the Commonal|ty with a plau&s;ible Declaration for Liberty, and to throw off the Yoke which had &s;o long gauled the Neck of <HI>Hungary;</HI> whereby having rai&s;ed an Army of twenty thou&s;and Hor&s;e, and thirty thou&s;and Foot, he entred, and &s;poiled the Coun|try of his old Enemy and Neighbour the Count of <HI>Humanay</HI> an Hungarian, took <HI>Solnock</HI> by force, and be&s;ieged <HI>Fileck,</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;&s;ovia:</HI> For &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of which In&s;urrection and Rebelli|on of <HI>Ragotski,</HI> the Emperor was forced to a War; and having Rendezvou&s;ed his Army at <HI>Presbourg,</HI> the Conduct thereof was committed to the Charge of Cout <HI>Puceain.</HI></P>
<P>The Turks having intelligence of the&s;e Pre|parations for War, commanded twenty thou|&s;and Men to march into tho&s;e Parts to oppo&s;e the&s;e Combu&s;tions on the Frontiers; with &s;ix|thou&s;and of which the Count <HI>Puecaim</HI> encoun|tering furiou&s;ly, a&s;&s;aulted and routed them. And in the mean time <HI>Ragotski</HI> laying a&s;ide all care for the War in <HI>Hungary,</HI> applied him&s;elf to relieve <HI>Olimz</HI> in <HI>Moravia;</HI> but in his March thither he was recalled by the Inhabitants of <HI>Sendar,</HI> which is a Ca&s;tle erected on a Hill near <HI>Ca&s;&s;ovia,</HI> offer|ing to &s;urrender unto him; but the Governor <HI>Forgatz,</HI> of the People, a Civil War began a|mong&s;t them&s;elves, but at length the advantage falling unto <HI>Ragotski,</HI> the Gates were opened un|to the Tran&s;ylvanians; with which Succe&s;s their Spirits being rai&s;ed to higher Matters, they pro|ceeded forward, until General <HI>Getz</HI> with a &s;trong Body, gave a &s;top unto their Progre&s;s. And thus was the Fire of &s;ar rekindled again in <HI>Hungary,</HI> by means of <HI>Ragotski;</HI> to whom notwith&s;tanding the Turks would never adhere, being well acquainted with his turbulent and un&s;teady Humour. In the mean time the Empe|ror di&s;patched his Amba&s;&s;ador with rich Presents to the Sultan, de&s;iring him to forbear giving far|ther A&s;&s;i&s;tance unto <HI>Ragotski;</HI> but what between
<PB N="55" REF="30">Skirmi&s;hes, Propo&s;itions, and Treaties, Matters were not compl&s;ed until the <HI>14th</HI> of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1645, at which time all Articles were concluded and &s;igned between the Emperor and <HI>Ragotski.</HI></P>
<P>But to return now to the Affairs of <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople;</HI> Sultan <HI>Ibrahim</HI> having the Fortune of Active and Prudent Mini&s;ters, attended en|tirely to his Pa&s;times and Plea&s;ures, without Prejudice to his Intere&s;t, and the State of his Empire; for the fir&s;t Vizier being Faithful and Vigilant, immediately cut off tho&s;e Members with the Sword, which he &s;u&s;pected in the lea&s;t manner inclinable to Sedition; among&s;t which were the Pa&s;haws of <HI>Aleppo</HI> and <HI>Caffa.</HI> For by this kind of &s;ea&s;onable and &s;peedy Remedies, the Plethory of the Ottoman Empire is common|ly evacuated, and the Body Politick thereof re&s;tored to its pri&s;tine &s;tate of Health and Safety.</P>
<P>In like manner the <HI>Valede Sultana,</HI> being a Woman of great Courage and Abilities, attend|ed carefully to the Welfare of her Son, whom &s;he &s;ometimes decked up, and &s;et forth as a Property of Maje&s;tick Gravity to the People, whil&s;t &s;he her &s;elf a&s;&s;umed the Authority, and carried allthings with a high and imperious Spi|rit; and being ambitious to be feared as well as honoured, &s;he laid Viloent Hands on the fir&s;t Vi|zier, called <HI>Mu&s;tapha,</HI> and &s;trangled him; for though he was an Active and Faithful Mini&s;ter, yet becau&s;e he pa&s;&s;ed &s;omething on her which &s;he imagined did favour of neglect, and becau&s;e &s;he ap|prehended his Power, which was greatly confirmed by the Intere&s;t and Favour he had with the Jani&s;a|ries, and their Favourers, &s;he re&s;olved to make him an Example, as well of her Revenge, as her Power; after who&s;e Death the Charge of fir&s;t Vizier was conferred on <HI>Mahomet</HI> the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Dama&s;cus.</HI></P>
<P>The fame Fate befel the Captain-Pa&s;ha, who was likewi&s;e &s;trangled for having over-boldly, or peremptorily, made an&s;wer to &s;ome Imper|tinencies of the Grand Signior; and his Office was afterwards conferred on <HI>Beker</HI> Pa&s;ha of <HI>Rhodes.</HI> With &s;uch Rigour as this do the Sul|tans govern, who re&s;olve to be obeyed, and to have their Commands executed without delay or contradiction.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e Matters were in agitation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Tar|tars make Incur&s;ions into <HI>Po|land,</HI> not|with&s;tand|ing the Peace.</NOTE> the Tartars forgetful of their Peace, made another Incur&s;ion with thirty thou&s;and Men into <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> again&s;t whom <HI>Koni&s;polski</HI> having made Head with twenty thou&s;and Men only, overthrew them, and killed twelve thou&s;and, and took three thou&s;and Pri&s;oners, pur&s;uing the re&s;t to the Borders of <HI>Walachia.</HI> In like manner <HI>Wi&s;no|wick,</HI> a noble Polander, happily encountred ano|ther Party of Tartars, as they were on their re|turn from &s;poiling the Countries of <HI>Mo&s;covia;</HI> of whom having killed 10000 Men, he recovered their Booty, and &s;ent the re&s;t Home naked and empty. This was the true and mo&s;t effectual Means for the Polanders to avenge and right their Injuries, and more prevalent then Amba&s;&s;ies and Me&s;&s;ages of Complaint unto the Port; which we have experienced &s;ince, and in the pre&s;ent Reign of the Son of <HI>Ibrahim,</HI> to have been &s;o far from producing Matter worthy &s;o much as the Charge of the Amba&s;&s;ador, that they have been retorted with lgnominy and affronts.</P>
<P>But here <HI>Ibrahim</HI> perceiving how the Poles had avenged them&s;elves with their own Sword, would &s;eem to approve of the Action, which he could not hinder; and to appear a &s;incere Ob&s;erver of the Peace, he depo&s;ed the Tartar <HI>Han</HI> for his unlawful Incur&s;ions; which was &s;uch a &s;atisfacti|on to the Crown of <HI>Poland,</HI> as they never could obtain by force of Ju&s;tice, Complaints, and Vertue of pa&s;&s;ive Valour, until their active Fortitude cook their Cau&s;e in Hand, and pleaded for them.</P>
<P>On the <HI>19th</HI> of <HI>March</HI> of this Year, a fourth Son was born to Sultan <HI>Ibrahim;</HI> and on the <HI>19th</HI> of <HI>February</HI> following, being in the Year 1645, notwith&s;tanding all the Reports of his Impotency, was born a fifth Son, named <HI>So|lyman,</HI> to the great contentment of his Peo|ple.</P>
<P>The Turks Gallies this Year, under the Com|mand of <HI>Beker</HI> their new Captain-Pa&s;ha, made an Attempt on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Calabria,</HI> bringing from thence two hundred Slaves; and attempting the like near <HI>Corton,</HI> paid for their former Booty, with the lo&s;s of five hundred Men.</P>
<P>How &s;oever, the Gallies of <HI>Malta,</HI> being &s;ix in number, had better Succe&s;s as to them&s;elves, though the Con&s;equences thereof proved fatal to the Venetians, having given the fir&s;t occa&s;ion of that long War, which afterwards en&s;ued be|tween the Turk and them.</P>
<P>The truth of which Story is this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Story of Kuzlir Aga, his Slave and Son taken by the Mal|te&s;es.</NOTE> free of all Romance or Fable, which the Knights of St. <HI>John</HI> or <HI>Malta</HI> would mix therewith: It happened that the Kuzlir Aga, or chief Eunuch, which governs the Women in the Signior's Seraglio, having ca&s;t his Eye on a fair Slave, then &s;et to &s;ale by a Per&s;ian Merchant, became &s;o enamoured of her, that he purcha&s;ed her for him&s;elf, under the No|tion of a virgin, at the price of four hundred and fifty Dollars: But the Eunuch had not long entertained this Lady in his Service, before &s;he proved with Child; not by him (you may con|ceive) if you under&s;tand how the Eunuchs of this Country are di&s;arm'd of their Virility: At which he was &s;o greatly offended, that he ba|ni&s;hed her from his Society, and confined her to the Hou&s;e of his Steward. The time being come for her to be delivered of her great Belly, it proved a Son; and &s;ome Months after, the Aga being de&s;irous to &s;ee the Babe, was &s;o plea&s;ed with the a&s;pect of it, that he re&s;olved to adopt it for his own, ordering it Cloaths, and other Nece&s;&s;aries agreeable to its Condition. It hap|pened that about that time Sultan <HI>Mahomet</HI> (which now reigns) was then born; and there wanting a Nur&s;e for the Child, this beautiful Slave was preferred to the Honour; &s;o that &s;he was entertained near two Years in the Seraglio: During which time Sultan <HI>Ibrahim</HI> took &s;uch an affection to the Nur&s;e's Boy, that he loved him better than his own elde&s;t Son, who was of a bad Complexion, and of no better Air in his Face than his Father, and took great delight to play and &s;port with him; at which the Mother of Sultan <HI>Mahomet</HI> was &s;o di&s;plea&s;ed, that &s;he could not longer endure either Nur&s;e or her Boy; and for her &s;ake, took &s;o much di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t the Kuzlir Aga, who preferred her, that neither his pre&s;ence nor Service were acceptable; and &s;o violent &s;he was in her Pa&s;&s;ion, that one day, when Sultan <HI>Ibrahim</HI> was playing with his Wo|men and Children in the Garden, according to his u&s;ual Cu&s;tom, throwing them one on the other into the Water, the Queen grew &s;o furi|ous, that &s;he could not contain longer from venting her Anger in unhan&s;ome Terms, and jealou&s;y again&s;t the Nur&s;e and her Son. At which the Sultan being much di&s;plea&s;ed, and be|ing ill-natured, (if we may &s;peak boldly of an Emperor) took her Son (which is now Sultan <HI>Mahomet</HI>) out of her Arms, and with &s;ome few Cur&s;es &s;wung him into a Ci&s;tern; where he had been certainly drowned, had not every one in that in&s;tance applied them&s;elves to &s;ave him; at
<PB N="56" REF="31">which time he received the Mark or Scar he wears at this day in his Forehead.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Matters &s;erved for farther Fuel to nouri&s;h the implacable Spirit of the Queen; which the Kuzlir Aga well ob&s;erving, judged it prudence to give way to her Fury, and &s;o beg|ged his Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from the Court, together with his Slave and Son; and that having wi&s;ited <HI>Mecha,</HI> according to his Law, he might enjoy a Retirement in <HI>Egypt,</HI> which is the Portion of ba|ni&s;hed Eunuchs.</P>
<P>The Queen ea&s;ily con&s;ented hereunto; nor was it difficult to procure the Licence of the Sul|tan, who was as ea&s;ily per&s;waded to any by tho&s;e who were about him; wherefore the Eunuch ha|ving provided, to be gone, &s;hipped him&s;elf with his great Trea&s;ure, on the Fleet which was now de&s;igned, and ready to depart for <HI>Alexandria,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ted of three Ships; one a great Gallion, and two others of le&s;&s;er Burthen, and &s;even Saiks; the&s;e having at the beginning of their Voyage found contrary Winds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The En|gagement of the Tur|ki&s;h with the <HI>Malta</HI> Gallies.</NOTE> put into <HI>Rhodes;</HI> from whence loo&s;ing with more favou|rable Weather, they unfortunately met with &s;ix <HI>Malta</HI> Gallies, excellently well manned, and provided. The Admiral Gally immediately Boarded one of the Saiks, and took her, man|ned only by Greeks; by whom they were in|formed of the Condition, Quality, and Cargo of the greater Ship, which gave Heat and Re|&s;olution to the Souldiery. In like manner, with little Opp&s;ition, the Gallies called the St. <HI>John,</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of one of the le&s;&s;er Ships, which being laden only with Tim|ber, brought from the Black Sea, to build Ships at <HI>Alexandria,</HI> was of little value, having forty Turks aboard, eight Women, and a Child which &s;ucked at the Mother's Brea&s;t. In the mean time, the three other Gallies, called the St. <HI>Mary,</HI> St. <HI>Lorenzo,</HI> and <HI>Victory,</HI> attacked the great Gallion, and having ca&s;t their Iron Graples into the Ship, with the Motion of the Ship, the Irons gave way and broke, only that of the St. <HI>Lorenzo</HI> held fa&s;t, &s;o that the whole force of the Ship, both of &s;mall and great Shot, was poured in upon the Gally, to their damage and lo&s;s of Men. In the mean time the Admiral Gally came in to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and A&s;&s;aulting the Ship on the other Quarter, made a Diver&s;ion of their Men; and having thrown in their Graples, they &s;caled the &s;ides of the Gallion, as if it had been a Fortre&s;s; where being entred, they remained for &s;ome time at handy-blows with the Turks; but at length, all the Gallies coming to their help, having made an end of &s;ubduing the other Ships, the Turks were forced to retire under Covert of their Decks, which they defended &s;till with &s;ingular Valour, wounding the Chri&s;ti|ans with their half Pikes through the Gra|tings.</P>
<P>But, in fine, the Captains of the Gallies, per|ceiving that this was not the way to compel them to a &s;peedy Surrender, ordered &s;everal Mu&s;que|tiers out of every Gally, to &s;ire in at the Win|dows and loop-holes of the Ship; by which ha|ving killed their Commander in Chief, their Va|lour and Con&s;tancy began to fail, and de&s;irous to &s;ave their lives with lo&s;s of Liberty and E|&s;tates, they ca&s;t down their Arms, and begged Mercy.</P>
<P>In this Engagement were killed the Captain of the St. <HI>Mary,</HI> and &s;even Cavaliers, of which five were French, one Italian, and one German; the Admiral him&s;elf, and the Captain of his Gally were both wounded; &s;eventy nine Soul|diers and Mariners killed, and an hundred thirty two wounded: Of the Turks it is not certain how many fell, in regard as they were killed, according to Cu&s;tom, they ca&s;t them over-board; the Eunuch him&s;elf, though always educated in the &s;oftne&s;s of the Seraglio, and in the Conver|&s;ation of the Female Court, yet in the end con|cluded his days like one of the Ma&s;culine Sex, fighting valiantly with his Sword, until over|whelmed by his Enemies: by which it is ob&s;er|vable, that tho&s;e Per&s;ons lo&s;e not their Courage with their virile Parts; for it hath been known in former days, how that Eunuchs have been Generals in the Turki&s;h and other Armies, and conducted their Affairs with admirable Courage and Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>The Prize which the Chri&s;tians had gained in this manner, was very con&s;iderable; for be&s;ides the Gold, Silver, and Jawels, which were the Trea&s;ure this Eunuch had ama&s;&s;ed in the Reign of three &s;everal Sultans, they gained three hun|dred and fifty Slaves, be&s;ides thirty Women, &s;ome of which were young and Virgins; &s;o that there was not a Souldier or Seaman who had not a con&s;iderable &s;hare of benefit proportioned un|to him. With this Fortune, towing their Pri|zes, they in a &s;hort time came to an Anchor in the Port of <HI>Cali&s;mene,</HI> in the I&s;land of <HI>Candia,</HI> called anciently <HI>Phenice,</HI> on the South-&s;ide of the I&s;land, remote from all Venetian Gari&s;ons; and where (as it is reported) they were &s;upplied with no Provi&s;ions, excepting a &s;mall quantity of Bisket, which was furni&s;hed by a Coutry Fellow, who for that very Cau&s;e was &s;hot to Death. From hence the Gallies departing, ar|rived in <HI>Malta</HI> with their Prizes, where they were received in great Triumph. The young Son of the Eunuch (for &s;o we call him) was reported to be a Son of the Grand Signior, fent into <HI>Egypt</HI> to be Educated, and was accordingly &s;aluted, treated, and reverenced by the Grand Ma&s;ter; the &s;ame Opinion was di&s;per&s;ed and confirmed in all parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> and the Er|rour for many Years maintained at the Ex|pence of the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Of the Knights of <HI>Malta.</HI></NOTE> Religion, until the Boy grow|ing up to a good Age, and not judged worthy of a Ran&s;om, or enquiry after by the Turks, it was thought convenient for him to put off his State, and Greatne&s;s, and become a Fryer, and I think a Dominican, and this is he who now goes under the name of the <HI>Padre Ottomano.</HI></P>
<P>The News hereof arriving at the Ottoman Court, Sultan <HI>Ibrahim</HI> was tran&s;ported with An|ger, threatning De&s;truction and Ruin unto <HI>Mal|ta;</HI> be&s;ides he &s;hewed a mo&s;t inveterate Pa&s;&s;ion again&s;t the Venetians, for not guarding the Seas from his Enemies, and for relieving them in their Ports. In which Rage and Fury, he put his own Captain Pa&s;ha to death, and Summoned the Chri&s;tian Amba&s;&s;adors, braving them all for the little re&s;pect was &s;hown to his proper Ship|ing; and in &s;hort, was angry with all, but re|&s;erved the Effect of his Wrath to be poured on the Venetians, to which this Accident admini|&s;tred the fir&s;t Original, and will afford us am|ple matter of Di&s;cour&s;e in this en&s;uing Hi&s;to|ry.</P>
<P>For the Grand Signior fir&s;t made his Com|plaints again&s;t <HI>Venice,</HI> to their Mini&s;ter, or Bai|lo, then re&s;ident at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> called <HI>Soran&ccedil;o;</HI> alledging, that contrary to the Articles of Peace, they had afforded Prvi&s;ions and Entertainment to his Enemies in <HI>Candia,</HI> and at a time when having made Prize of his own Ship, and Dome|&s;tiques of his Seraglio, they &s;eemed, with more extraordinary demon&s;trations of Ho&s;pitality than u&s;ual, to receive them into their Harbours.
<PB N="57" REF="31">To which the Bailo made An&s;wer, That his Maje|&s;ty was ill informed of the true &s;tate of tho&s;e Mat|ters; for that the Port to which the Malte&s;es came, had neither Ca&s;tle nor Fortre&s;s belonging to it, but was an open, wide, and unfortified place; for if the Grand Signior is not able to defend tho&s;e Ships from careening, as they have often done before <HI>Rhodes</HI> it &s;elf, how was it po&s;&s;ible for the Venetians to drive them from the Seas, and deny them the u&s;e of that Salt Water, which hath neither Fort nor Ca&s;tle to reach and command them? With which An&s;wer <HI>Ibrahim</HI> &s;eemed to remain &s;atisfied; and Matters ap|peared &s;o appea&s;ed on the &s;ide of the Veneti|ans, that <HI>Soran&ccedil;o,</HI> though a Per&s;on of a mo&s;t acute and penetrating Judgment, imagined no|thing le&s;s than a War: and though he was a&s;|&s;ured otherwi&s;e, by &s;omething that the Engli&s;h Amba&s;&s;ador had di&s;covered in that Matter; yet becau&s;e it came not fir&s;t from the Report of one of his own Interpreters, he would not &s;eem to believe or give credit thereunto, notwith|&s;tanding the &s;trong Probabilities that might per|&s;wade it.</P>
<P>Indeed, Chri&s;tian Mini&s;ters mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily, with much Difficulties, and le&s;s In&s;pection, go|vern and penetrate Affairs in the Turki&s;h Court than in any other; becau&s;e acce&s;s to the great Mini&s;ters is &s;eldom privately or familiarly ad|mitted, from whence wi&s;e Men mo&s;t commonly take their Mea&s;ures and Ob&s;ervations; but on the contrary, are forced to act all by the Nego|tiation, of their Druggermen or Interpreters; and as they hear with their Ears, &s;o are they often-times beholden to their Reflections; which how &s;ubject they may be to Error, is be&s;t known to tho&s;e Mini&s;ters who have practi&s;ed much and long in that Court.</P>
<P>And in this manner <HI>Ibrahim</HI> covered his De|&s;ign again&s;t <HI>Candia,</HI> by pretence of making War upon <HI>Malta,</HI> to which he had lately recei|ved &s;o ju&s;t a provocation.</P>
<P>To this Enterprize, none in&s;tigated him more than a certain Hagia, or Tutor, which had ac|companied him in the time of his Solitude, and had in&s;tructed him in the fir&s;t Principles of the Mahometan Doctrine; he was a &s;ubtil and un|der&s;tanding Man, and one who kept a &s;ecret Cor|re&s;pondence in the Chri&s;tian Courts; for being Ma&s;ter of what Gold he plea&s;ed, he paid for his Intelligence with Liberality and Secre&s;y; and though he was no Prophet, yet he pretended to be a Magician, or Conjurer, or one that had a Command or Soveraignty over Familiar Spirits; an Excellency greatly admired and reverenced by the Turks. This Man had for a long Sea&s;on at|tended an opportunity to promote a War a|gain&s;t <HI>Venice;</HI> e&s;teeming their Territories very convenient to be laid to the Turki&s;h Dominions, and their Force an under-Match for the Pui&s;|&s;ance of the Ottoman Empire. And now this Accident provoking the De&s;ire of the Turks to this War, and the Opportunity appearing com|modious to cover the De&s;ign, under pretence of A&s;&s;ailing <HI>Malta,</HI> it was &s;ecretly re&s;olved to at|tempt the I&s;land of <HI>Candia;</HI> for as its Strength and Situation made it the Key to all the other I&s;les of the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> &s;o it would be the Bull|wark of the Maritime Countries, from whence the Pa&s;&s;age would be &s;hort and ea&s;y into <HI>Africa;</HI> from whence the Gallies might advantagiou&s;ly relieve <HI>Cyprus,</HI> and guard the Fleet from <HI>Egypt,</HI> and from thence might be opened a Door to in|vade <HI>Sicily,</HI> and the other parts of <HI>Italy.</HI> On the&s;e Con&s;iderations, War being re&s;olved again&s;t <HI>Candia,</HI> Reports divulged the De&s;ign only again&s;t <HI>Malta,</HI> and for that end, Orders were i&s;&s;ued for building and fitting an hundred Gallies, and as many Ships of War; and Commands &s;ent into <HI>Barbary</HI> for a&s;&s;i&s;tance of all their Naval Force, and the Day appointed for Rendezvous and De|parture; all which time the Enterprize was kept &s;ecret, and by no more Symptoms &s;u&s;pected, un|le&s;s by the unu&s;ual Care&s;&s;es the Turks at that time over-acted in their officious kindne&s;s to|wards the Venetian Bailo.</P>
<P>The Report of the&s;e great Preparations fly|ing over all Parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> was entertained at <HI>Malta,</HI> with &s;ome Apprehen&s;ions, as being the Place on which all the Storm was to refund its Fury.</P>
<P>Whereupon the Cavaliers or Knights of that Place, &s;ummoning a Council, re&s;olved to cite all the Fraternity to repair to the Defence of their Capital Seat, and of their Order and Pa|trimony. Likewi&s;e Letters were directed to the &s;everal Officers, to prepare and &s;end Pow|der, Match, and Lead, Iron Buckets, and Tim|ber to make Carriages for Cannon, and for other U&s;es; as al&s;o Corn, Bisket, Salt, Fle&s;h and Fi&s;h, Vinegar, Wine, and all other &s;orts of Ammunition. They likewi&s;e in&s;tituted &s;ome Officers over the Waters, to &s;ee that the Foun|tains and Conduits &s;hould be made clear which were to &s;erve the City; and that tho&s;e with|out, that were to remain in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Enemy, &s;hould be carefully and artificially poi|&s;oned; all the Mills remaining in the Fields were tran&s;ported into the Town; the Doors and Windows of Wood belonging to the Pea|&s;ants Hou&s;es, were taken down and carried into the City, with all their Uten&s;ils, and what el&s;e was portable, &s;o that nothing remained but the wide Fields, and an open Air to breath in.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Venetians being a wi&s;e and jealous State, &s;u&s;pected the wer&s;t of all E|vents, and feared what their Mini&s;ter at <HI>Con|&s;tantinople</HI> could not di&s;cover; which cau&s;ed them to make &s;ome Preparations, but yet with that dexterity and &s;ecre&s;y, as not to render them diffident of the Turks Proceedings. For to be jealous of a Friend, is &s;ometimes to make him an Enemy; and Di&s;tru&s;t always argues Di&s;af|fection, which Prudence teaches to conceal from tho&s;e who are more powerful than our &s;elves. Some were notwith&s;tanding of Opinion, that the Complaints of <HI>Ibrahim</HI> were only Artifices to extract the Blood of Gold, which they judged fit to admini&s;ter, if it were po&s;&s;ible to, &s;atisfy the Appetite of tho&s;e Leeches. Others were of a contrary &s;en&s;e, and would by no means admit it for good Cou&s;el, or Policy, to buy their Peace of the Turk; for, be&s;ides that it was di&s;agreeable to the Grandeur of <HI>Venice,</HI> it was but a Shadow that they purcha&s;ed, &s;ince their Enemies could on every &s;light Occa&s;ion rea&s;&s;ume what they had &s;old, and make the Menaces of War, and the Sale of Peace, &s;erve them for a perpetual Fountain, an Mine of Gold and Trea&s;ure; and that &s;ince it was nece&s;&s;ary, at one time or other, to ca&s;t off this Yoke of Tyran|ny; the &s;ooner it was done, the Advantage would be the greater, and the Honour more ap|parent to the World, &s;eeming to make War ra|ther their Choice, than their la&s;t Remedy. How|&s;oever Orders were given to the Bailo, with all Prudence and Art, to touch gently the Pul&s;e of the Turks, to di&s;cover if Mony would redeem the pre&s;ent Quiet of their State.</P>
<P>But the Re&s;entment that the Turks had con|ceived, was grown apparent in the comportment towards the Bailo; for having one day demanded
<PB N="58" REF="32">Audience, he attended &s;everal hours without ad|mi&s;&s;ion; yet when the Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>Ragotski</HI> come to the Vizier, he no &s;ooner entred the Hou&s;e than he was received: and at the &s;ame time it was told the Bailo, that he might retire, for that there was no Place nor Sea&s;on at pre&s;ent to afford him Audience. In the mean time <HI>Ibra|him</HI> him&s;elf walked often to the Ar&s;enal, to for|ward and ha&s;ten his Preparations, laying an Em|bargo on all Strangers Ve&s;&s;els in all Ports of the Ottoman Dominions. Orders were likewi&s;e di&s;patched to <HI>Thebes, Negropont,</HI> and other Parts of <HI>Greece,</HI> for making Bisket; and to the <HI>Morea</HI> for cutting and &s;quaring of Timbers, and &s;acking Wools to fill up Trenches; in all which Rumor and Stir, there are was no other di&s;cour&s;e but of <HI>Malta,</HI> and of throwing that I&s;land into the Sea with the Shovel and Mattock, and rendring it the mo&s;t dreadful Example in the World of the Ottoman Rage and Greatne&s;s.</P>
<P>With &s;uch Preludes as the&s;e, began a War of long continuance, maintained with various Suc|ce&s;&s;es for divers Years; the fatal I&s;&s;ue whereof, we our &s;elves have &s;een and heard. But it is &s;trange to con&s;ider, that an Exploit &s;o Martial as this, &s;hould commence in the Reign of a Sul|tan wholly given up to his Plea&s;ures, and &s;o &s;wallowed in Sen&s;uality, that all tho&s;e luxu|rious and wanton Actions which are recounted of <HI>Sardanapalus</HI> and <HI>Heliogabalus,</HI> are flat and faint Similitudes of that prodigious Effeminacy, in which this Sultan outdid all other Examples of former Ages.</P>
<P>Amber was the common Perfumes which bur|ned perpetually in the Womens Apartments, and the common Sauce to mo&s;t of his Viands; not perhaps becau&s;e it &s;o much plea&s;ed his Pa|late, as that it was a provocative, and incite|ment to his Lu&s;ts.</P>
<P>And this puts me in mind of a Story I have heard of an Engli&s;h Merchant, living then at <HI>Galata,</HI> who was Ma&s;ter of a rare piece of Am|bergrie&s;e, which was in form like a Pyramid; the News whereof was told to the Grand Signior late at Night, when the Smoke of the Per&s;umes began to abate: Which &s;o &s;oon as he heard, though it was near Midnight, he di&s;patched a Me&s;&s;enger to call the Merchant with his Amber|grie&s;e; who being knocked out of his Bed in ha&s;te, by the importunity of the Officer, came to the Seraglio Gate two hours before Day; where he attended until it was broad Light, and then, without more words, found a Market for his Amber, and before his departure received 13 thou&s;and Dollars. The Female Court was then extreamly rich and &s;plendid, all <HI>Italy</HI> was &s;carce able to &s;upply it with Silks, and Cloth of Gold; &s;o that the Trade was in tho&s;e days flouri&s;hing above other Times, and gave great employment to Engli&s;h Shipping: and &s;o impatient were the Women for their Gay Cloaths, that &s;o &s;oon as the News of a Ship from <HI>Italy</HI> came, and that &s;he was arrived within the Ca&s;tles of the <HI>Helle|&s;pont,</HI> but there detained by contrary Winds, Gallies were immediately di&s;patched to bring up their Silks, which they oftentimes forced away without any Account or Price made with the Merchant; of which that worthy Gentleman, Sir <HI>Thomas Bendy&s;h</HI> then Amba&s;&s;ador, complain|ing to the Vizier, and finding no other Relief than good Words, re&s;olved on an Expedient of making known his Cau&s;e to the Grand Signior, which was this.</P>
<P>In <HI>Turkie</HI> they have a Cu&s;tom, that when any one receives a notable Injury, or Inju&s;tice, from the Chief and Great Mini&s;ters of State, they put Fire on their Heads, and running to the Grand Signior, no Man can hinder or deny them acce&s;s to his pre&s;ence. In like manner the Eng|li&s;h Amba&s;&s;ador not being able to obtain Sati&s;|faction from the Vizier, in return to his many Complaints, drew out all the Engli&s;h Ships in <HI>Ga|lata,</HI> which were then thirteen in number, and drawing in their Guns, and &s;hutting the Ports, put fire on every Yard-Arm of their Ships, and came to an Anchor ju&s;t before the <HI>Seraglio.</HI> The Cu&s;tomer being the fir&s;t that e&s;pyed this unu&s;ual &s;ight, immediately apprehended the Rea&s;on, and &s;ent to acquaint the Vizier thereof in all ha&s;te; the Vizier likewi&s;e fearful le&s;t the Complaints &s;hould by this means come to the Grand Signior's Ear, &s;ent the Cu&s;tomer aboard with a con&s;iderable part of the Mony, and de|&s;ired that the Fires might be extingui&s;hed, pro|mi&s;ing faithfully to comply in paiment of the re&s;t; hereupon Con&s;ultation being had between the Amba&s;&s;ador and the Merchants, the Ships returned to their Stations, not &s;eeming to have been taken notice of by tho&s;e in the Seraglio.</P>
<P>And notwith&s;tanding the great number of Women within the Seraglio, all which were at the Devotion of the Sultan; yet <HI>Ibrahim</HI> not be|ing contented herewith, pa&s;&s;ing one day to <HI>Scu|tari,</HI> had by chance ca&s;t his eye on an object which much plea&s;ed him: what it was, becomes not the mode&s;ty of my Pen to relate; but being re|turned to his Seraglio, he &s;ent Orders to the Vi|zier, to &s;eek out for him the bigge&s;t, and be&s;t proportioned Woman which was to be found in all <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and the parts thereabouts. Hereupon Emi&s;&s;aries were di&s;patched into all Quarters of the City; at length they happily procured a huge tall Armenian Woman, well proportioned according to her height, and a Giante&s;s for her Stature; which being found, &s;he was pre&s;ently wa&s;hed and perfumed in the Bath, and as richly Cloathed and Adorned as the &s;hortne&s;s of time would permit: There was no great difficulty to per&s;wade her to become Turk, having &s;o high preferment in her pro|&s;pect. So that being introduced to the Grand Signior's pre&s;ence, he became immediately Ena|moured, and was &s;o plea&s;ed with her Society, that he preferred her before all the Women of his Court; an Evidence whereof he gave, in that he could not deny her in any reque&s;t &s;he could make, and particularly about that time the Pa&s;haluck of <HI>Dama&s;cus</HI> being void, this Wo|man begged it for her &s;elf, &s;ub&s;tituting another in the Office, who was accountable to her for all the Profits and Emoluments thereof: By the&s;e particulars of favour the Queen-Mother becom|ing jealous, one day inviting her to Dinner, cau&s;ed her to be &s;trangled, and per&s;waded <HI>Ibra|him</HI> that &s;he died &s;uddenly of a violent Sickne&s;s, at which he poor Man was greatly afflicted.</P>
<P>But not to in&s;i&s;t long on the&s;e luxurious Pa&s;|times, we &s;hall return again to Matters of high|er Concernment: <HI>Ibrahim</HI> had now under&s;tood, that the Venetians growing jealous of his Pre|parations, began likewi&s;e to Arm, and provide for the wor&s;t; which being in no wi&s;e plea&s;ing to the Turks, who were apprehen&s;ive that their Marine Forces con&s;i&s;ted mo&s;t in &s;urprize, cau&s;ed <HI>Ibrahim</HI> to complain of the Defen&s;ive Po&s;ture in which they Arrayed them&s;elves, alledging, that Su&s;picions of this Nature argued no hearty Di&s;po&s;ition towards their Friends; nor was any thing more contrary to a good Corre&s;pondence, or more di&s;obliging than &s;uch like Jealou&s;ies, which oft-times beget that Enmity which was never de&s;igned; and farther it was judged nece&s;|&s;ary,
<PB N="59" REF="32">if po&s;&s;ible, to di&s;&s;wade the Bailo from a belief of any Ho&s;tility de&s;igned again&s;t his Re|publick; to inculcate which, none was e&s;teemed &s;o proper an In&s;trument as the old cheating <HI>Ho|gia,</HI> who was the fir&s;t Motive to the War; a Preacher who imagined that the excellency of his Religion afforded him a priviledg to fal&s;ify, lye, and commit any Act for advantage thereof, though never &s;o contrary to Truth and Morality. This <HI>Santone,</HI> with the Te&s;timony of one or two more grand Profe&s;&s;ors, with many A&s;&s;eve|rations and Vows, endeavoured to per&s;wade the Bailo, of the Grand Signior's good Intentions towards <HI>Venice,</HI> and his fixed Re&s;olutions to de|&s;troy <HI>Malta.</HI> And though the Concernment which tho&s;e godly Elders &s;hewed, and the ear|ne&s;tne&s;s they u&s;ed, whereby to inculcate a Cre|dence to what they affirmed, were enough to di&s;cover their contrary Intentions; and though it is &s;aid, that the Venetians could not heartily believe what they &s;o &s;trongly &s;u&s;pected; yet hereby, and by the common vogue of the Peo|ple, they abated much of their Caution and Heat, which they otherwi&s;e had u&s;ed in due Pre|parations and Provi&s;ions again&s;t an Evil &s;o fatal and de&s;tructive in the &s;equel.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Act of Ho&s;tility was committed by <HI>Giacomo da Riva,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The begin|ning of the War.</NOTE> who being &s;ent for Sopravedi|tor to <HI>Tino,</HI> was in his way to touch at <HI>Candia,</HI> there to deliver Ammunition and Provi&s;ions for War; but being encountered by &s;ome barbarous Ve&s;&s;els, who a&s;&s;ailed him for a Merchants Ship of &s;mall Force, were received &s;o warmly that he &s;unk one of them, with which the re&s;t left him and fled, relating at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> that they had been ill treated by the Venetians, and that they gave the fir&s;t A&s;&s;ault upon them, becau&s;e they were called to the A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Service of the Grand Signior.</P>
<P>The Fleet and Land Forces being already put to Sea, the Report and Opinion &s;till continued, that the War was de&s;igned again&s;t <HI>Mal|ta;</HI> wherefore &s;uch as apprehended the Hazard, and were acquainted with the Difficulty of &s;uch an Enterprize, began to inform the Grand Sig|nior how impo&s;&s;ible it was that this Action &s;hould be accompanied with good &s;ucce&s;s. To which Arguments he made no other reply, than by a &s;eeing ob&s;tinacy, re&s;olved with the Ot|toman Sword, to cut all tho&s;e Knots and Dif|ficulties which oppo&s;ed him in the Work. At length one <HI>Salee Efendi,</HI> a Preacher, who had obtained &s;ome more than ordinary E&s;teem with the Grand Signior, advi&s;ed him, That before he commenced a Work of that importance, he &s;hould inform him&s;elf of the true &s;tate of that Place, from a certain Aga, who was lately re|turned from <HI>Malta.</HI> The Grand Signior being very willing to hear any thing of this nature, called the Aga, who related to him how im|pregnable both the City and Ca&s;tle were; how the Knights were provided again&s;t all A&s;&s;aults; that the I&s;land it &s;elf is only a Rock, not con|taining Earth enough for an Army to intrench; that the Approaches mu&s;t be made by the Pick-Axe and Mattock, it being all Stone. In &s;hort, it was not a place to be taken in one Summer, and the Winter coming on, it affording no &s;hel|ter, nor provi&s;ions of it &s;elf, was not capable of relief in Seas &s;o &s;tormy, and from Countries &s;o remote, without hazards, lo&s;&s;es, and frequent Shipwracks. <HI>Ibrahim,</HI> who had de&s;igned all along to make War upon <HI>Candia,</HI> &s;eemed little concerned or moved at this Di&s;cour&s;e. The Gallies and Ships which were now all in a rea|dine&s;s, being come forth to the Seraglio point, the Grand Signior entered his Grand Ciosk, &s;ituated on the Bank of the Sea; where the Se|lictar Aga, General, and all the Chief Com|manders, came to perform the u&s;ual Ceremonies of Obedience and Duty before their Departure. At this &s;olemn A&s;&s;embly the Grand Signior de|clared, That his Intentions were to make War upon the Infidels, according as every one &s;hould under&s;tand by his re&s;pective Commi&s;&s;ions, which &s;hould now be delivered unto them: That he expected the highe&s;t Demon&s;trations of Courage in them imaginable, and what was agreeable to the Conductors of the Ottoman Armies: That Reward and Puni&s;hment were in his Hands, and that he re&s;olved to di&s;pen&s;e them according to their Merits: That they &s;hould not doubt of all due A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Succours; for he had &s;o well contrived, and &s;o ju&s;tly fitted all his Mea&s;ures, that he was already provided of Men, Timber, Ammunition, and Mony &s;ufficient to maintain and carry on this War for &s;even Years. At which they all gave a &s;hout, and declared, that they were ready to &s;pend their Blood and Lives in Execution of his Commands. Whereupon every one received a rich Coftan, or Ve&s;t, and the General a Scimitar &s;et with Diamonds; who being a young Man of about 26, or 27 Years of Age, had a Council of &s;ix graver Pa&s;ha's al|lowed him; and then the Commi&s;&s;ion for the War was brought forth &s;ealed, with Orders not to open it, until they were pa&s;t the <HI>Dardanelli.</HI> Hereat the noi&s;e of great and &s;mall Shot from the Gallies and Ships, re&s;ounded through all <HI>Con|&s;tantinople,</HI> and the Commanders repairing to their Ve&s;&s;els, the A&s;&s;embly broke up, and every thing was put in a po&s;ture to make Sail.</P>
<P>It was now the la&s;t day of <HI>April,</HI> 1645, old Style, when the Fleet fir&s;t broke ground, which con&s;i&s;ted of 73 Gallies, be&s;ides the 8 Gallies of <HI>Barbary;</HI> 2 Mahons, or Gallea&s;&s;es, one great Gallion called the <HI>Sultana,</HI> 10 Ships of <HI>Alexan|dria,</HI> 2 of <HI>Tunis,</HI> and 10 of Engli&s;h and Dutch Ships, which coming to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> for Trade, were there pre&s;&s;ed into the Service, with about 300 Saiks and Caramu&s;&s;als, which carried Soul|diers, Provi&s;ions, Ammunition, and Uten&s;ils for War. Their Militia con&s;i&s;ted of 7000 Ja|ni&s;aries, 14000 Spahees, and about 50000 Ti|mariots, and other Souldiers, with about 3000 Pioniers; the&s;e all were to Rendezvous at <HI>Scio;</HI> where they arrived the <HI>7th</HI> of <HI>May.</HI> But before their departure from <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> the Bailo <HI>Soran&ccedil;o,</HI> or the Venetian Amba&s;&s;ador, thought fit, in Complement, and for di&s;covery, to make a vi&s;it to the Captain-Pa&s;ha, by whom he was received with frank Courte&s;y, and a&s;&s;urance of Friend&s;hip; &s;o that though he &s;u&s;pected the wor&s;t, yet could he collect no certain a&s;&s;urances of Peace, or War; however he advi&s;ed Signior <HI>Cornaro,</HI> then Governour of <HI>Candia,</HI> that though he could not certainly penerate into the bottom of the Turks De&s;ign, yet he apprehen|ded that the Storm might fall on that Kindom, under&s;tanding that the Captain-Pa&s;ha was not well inclined towards the mo&s;t Serene Repub|lick: wherefore, he ought to be watchful and circum&s;pect, yet with as little demon&s;tration of jealou&s;y as was po&s;&s;ible, &s;o that if the Turks &s;hould there arrive, he &s;hould afford them all conveniencies of Watering, Provi&s;ions, and other Refre&s;hments.</P>
<P>The Fleet being departed from <HI>Scio,</HI> for <HI>Na|poli di Romagnia,</HI> the Northern Wind &s;o fre&s;hned, and blew &s;o hard, that the Gallies were &s;epara|ted, and forced to put into divers Ports, and the Saiks and Caramu&s;&s;als to Anchor at <HI>Micono</HI>
<PB N="60" REF="33">and <HI>Tino.</HI> At the latter of which, belonging to the Venetians, they had licence to Water, and and were refre&s;hed with &s;uch provi&s;ions as the I&s;land afforded; and now after this flurry of Wind, the Fleet being again united, they were &s;een off at Sea from <HI>Cerigo,</HI> an I&s;land of the Ve|netians at the Mouth of the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> and failing towards the Channel of <HI>Braccio de Maina;</HI> and the next day 9 Gallies, a Gallion, and a Brigantine, made towards the I&s;le of <HI>Cerigo,</HI> and &s;ent a Letter a &s;hore by a Boat to the Pro|veditor, from the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Rhodes,</HI> demanding their u&s;ual pre&s;ent of Coffee and Sugar, which was given them, they a&s;&s;uring all Friend&s;hip, and real good Intentions towards the People, and Dominions of <HI>Venice.</HI></P>
<P>But in the mean time a Satia laden with Arms and Ammunition from <HI>Venice,</HI> bound for <HI>Retimo,</HI> unhappily falling into the Turki&s;h Fleet, was intercepted by them, and taken, which un|masked all the De&s;ign, and made the Turks ap|pear in their true Colours, notwith&s;tanding all their religious Prote&s;tations, and outwardly fair Comportment, the u&s;ual di&s;gui&s;e of the Maho|metan Sincerity.</P>
<P>Towards the end of <HI>May</HI> the Turki&s;h Fleet was di&s;covered from <HI>Carabu&s;o,</HI> a &s;mall Fortre&s;s of the Venetians, &s;ome di&s;tance off at Sea, &s;tanding to the We&s;tward, which gave &s;ome jealou&s;ie to them at <HI>Candia;</HI> and being compa|red with &s;ome precedent Acts, as that of &s;ound|ing the depth of Water about St. <HI>Theodoro</HI> with a Brigantine, (which is a &s;mall Rock lying off of <HI>Canea</HI>) which pretended to come from <HI>Sancta Maura</HI> with Turky Merchants, afforded unde|niable grounds of a&s;&s;urance to tho&s;e in <HI>Candia,</HI> that the War was de&s;igned again&s;t them; how|&s;oever, the Ottoman Fleet rendezvou&s;ing again at <HI>Navarino,</HI> a place far di&s;tant from <HI>Candia,</HI> altered their Apprehen&s;ions at <HI>Venice,</HI> and el&s;e|where of this War, deeming it now certain, that this De&s;ign had no other aim or mark but that of <HI>Malta.</HI></P>
<P>But this opinion was no &s;ooner entertain'd, than it was confuted by open Acts of ho&s;tility; for the Captain-Pa&s;ha being arrived at Cape <HI>Co|lonna,</HI> by &s;ome called <HI>Sunio,</HI> immediately di&s;|patched a Brigantine to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> with ad|vice of his Proceedings and Intentions to pa&s;s directly for <HI>Candia;</HI> whereupon it was thought &s;ea&s;onable to publi&s;h the War again&s;t <HI>Venice,</HI> which was performed with committing the Am|ba&s;&s;ador <HI>Soran&ccedil;o</HI> to Pri&s;ion, and giving Orders through all the <HI>Archipelago</HI> to de&s;troy or en&s;lave all the Subjects of that Republick. And here the Turk practi&s;ed his u&s;ual beginnings of War with more than ordinary Caution; for though with other Princes, who&s;e Territories border on him by Land, he u&s;ually endeavours to &s;trike at the &s;ame time when he gives the Salutations of Peace; Yet here being to contend at Sea, where he is con&s;cious his Forces are inferiour to tho&s;e of <HI>Venice,</HI> he practi&s;ed all tho&s;e feigned Artifices, confirmed with as many holy Vows and Pro|te&s;tations, as their Religion hallows, and makes lawful, when they can bring advantage and en|crea&s;e to the Mahometan Faith.</P>
<P>But though the Venetian Republick was &s;o politick as outwardly to demon&s;trate a Religious Confidence of their potent Neighbour, whom they were con&s;cious not to have provoked by any breach of Capitulations; yet were not &s;o &s;ecure of his Faith, and &s;o ea&s;ie to believe his fair Di&s;&s;imulations, as not prudently to provide again&s;t the utmo&s;t Effects of his Power and Treachery. Wherefore, whil&s;t the Turk pre|pared, they armed likewi&s;e &s;ecretly, made con|&s;iderable Levies without noi&s;e, commi&s;ionated thirty extraordinary Commanders of Gallies, took up &s;eventeen Engli&s;h and Dutch &s;hips into their Service, armed out two Gallia&s;&s;es extra|ordinary; and when the Turk had unmasked his De&s;ign, they then imparted their Condition to all the Chri&s;tian Princes, craving their Suc|cour and A&s;&s;i&s;tance to maintain the Common Bulwark of <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> againt&s;t the comme Ene|my. The Gallea&s;&s;es were commanded by <HI>Giro|lamo Moro&s;ini;</HI> the Gallies, of which fifteen were made ready, and afterwards put to Sea, all commanded by Noblemen, were under the Con|duct of <HI>Antonio Capello. France&s;co Molino</HI> was made Proveditor General, a Per&s;on of untainted Ju&s;tice and Honour, and extraordinary zealous and vigilant in the Publick Intere&s;t, who&s;e in|defatigable Labours and Care of his Country, promoted him afterwards to be Doge of <HI>Ve|nice.</HI> By his Order and Coun&s;el, extraordinary Proveditors were &s;ent to <HI>Candia, Cerigo,</HI> and <HI>Tino,</HI> as Places mo&s;t feared, and in danger; and Orders were di&s;patched to <HI>Andrea Cornaro,</HI> then General and Inqui&s;itor in <HI>Candia,</HI> to arm out twenty Gallies from the Ar&s;enal of <HI>Canea;</HI> and to promote this De&s;ign the better, he hired two Engli&s;h, and one Dutch Ship, then in Port of <HI>Malomocco,</HI> to carry unto <HI>Candia</HI> Timbers fitted, and already &s;quared at <HI>Venice,</HI> for building Gal|lies; be&s;ides which he &s;ent Cannon, Corn, and all Ammunition of War, with fifty thou&s;and Zechins in Gold for encouragement of the Mi|litia, with a recruit of two and twenty Compa|nies of Foot, formed and collected out of di|vers Nations.</P>
<P>Intelligence being come of the impri&s;onment of the Bailo at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> the Senate by a common and unanimous Suffrage elected <HI>Fran|ce&s;co Erizzo,</HI> then Doge, General of the Sea; judging, that their Arms would pro&s;per under his Command, which had formerly been &s;ucce&s;s|ful under the au&s;picious Conduct of his Ance|&s;tors; and he, though a Per&s;on of &s;eventy four Years, worn out with Age and Cares of the Publick, did yet chearfully con&s;ecrate the re|mainder of his days to the Service of his Coun|try. But whil&s;t he prepared to crown the end of his Life with the Glory of this important and generous Enterprize, Death terminated all his In|tentions, leaving him with the honourable me|mory of his pa&s;t Actions, and with a Lawrel hanging over his Head, which had his Life con|tinued, had been planted on his Brows. But that this Accident might not give interruption to the weighty Affairs now in had, <HI>Molino</HI> took his place, and proceeded in his Voyage and De|&s;igns, and arrived with the Venetian Fleet at the I&s;land of <HI>Corfu.</HI> In the mean time the Tur|ki&s;h Fleet careened and fitted them&s;elves at <HI>Na|varine</HI> with all Nece&s;&s;aries to a&s;&s;ault <HI>Candia;</HI> in which interim advice came to <HI>Canea,</HI> that the the Bailo was impri&s;oned at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> by a Letter from <HI>Soran&ccedil;o</HI> him&s;elf; which he had dropped from the Window of his clo&s;e re&s;traint, and di&s;patched by one of his Confidents with a Ve&s;&s;el expre&s;s; which was not &s;ooner arrived, than it was that Night confirmed by all the Bea|cons or Watch-Towers of the Country; who having di&s;coverd the Turki&s;h Fleet far di&s;tant as Sea, gave a general Alarm by the Fires they made.</P>
<P>The next Morning being the 23/13 of <HI>June,</HI> they di&s;covered the whole Fleet, near Cape <HI>Spada,</HI> which being drawn up in the form of an half Moon, took up a va&s;t tract of
<PB N="61" REF="33">Sea; and &s;ailing &s;lowly with fair Weather, and a &s;mooth Sea, di&s;played them&s;elves with the greate&s;t terrour imaginable to the I&s;landers. At length the lighter Ve&s;&s;els began to edge in with the Bank of <HI>Gogna,</HI> (which is a place di&s;tant about eighteen miles from <HI>Canea</HI>) and were fol|lowed by the gro&s;&s;er and heavier part of the Ar|mata.</P>
<P>And now, before I proceed farther, I &s;hould make a pau&s;e, and de&s;cribe the Antiquity, the Geography, and the pre&s;ent State of this famous and renowned I&s;land, but that is already perfor|med &s;o di&s;tinctly and elegantly by other Pens, that it &s;hall be &s;ufficient for me to declare here in brief terms, how this Kingdom became the Patrimony or Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Venice.</HI> In the Year 1204, a Sale thereof was made to this Repub|lick, by the Marque&s;s <HI>Bonifaccio</HI> of <HI>Montferratto,</HI> by an In&s;trument &s;ealed the <HI>12th</HI> of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> and &s;igned, and delivered, in the pre&s;ence of <HI>Marco Sanudo,</HI> and <HI>Ravano du Vero|na,</HI> Amba&s;&s;adours in the time of <HI>Enrigo Dandola</HI> Doge; but the People of this I&s;land not con&s;ent|ing unto the &s;ale, oppo&s;ed them&s;elves again&s;t it, until the Venetians by force of Arms procured their Obedience, and confirmed their purcha&s;e by a double Title. Hereupon &s;uch noble Citi|zens as adventured their Lives in his acqui&s;ition, obtained the E&s;tates of the Rebellious Greeks, being obliged in proportion to the Lands they held, to maintain Men and Hor&s;e at their own Charge, and are therefore called the Feudatary Cavalry. So that the whole Country is divided into three parts; <HI>viz.</HI> the noble Venetians or Ca|valry; &s;econdly, the noble Candiots, or Colo|ny, which were Infantry that came to inhabit from <HI>Venice;</HI> and thirdly, the Greeks or Na|tives of the Country which never rebelled, but took part with the Venetian State: the fir&s;t two &s;peak Italian, and are of the Roman Church; the others &s;peak Greek, and con&s;erve the Right of that Religion.</P>
<P>The Ottoman Fleet now touching the Shoar at <HI>Gogna,</HI> took Livery and Seizin quietly of that flouri&s;hing I&s;le of <HI>Candia,</HI> where they Encamped a while to refre&s;h their Forces, and prepare all things in order to their Conque&s;t. In the mean time, the news hereof alarmed all <HI>Venice,</HI> and not only ha&s;tened them in the expedition of their Fleet, but warmed their applications to all Chri&s;tian Princes, from whom they craved help in the general defence of Chri&s;tendom: which &s;ome at fir&s;t imagined would have been granted, as it was once in the time of the Holy War; or that tho&s;e whom the Declaration of a com|mon Cru&s;ada, or Devotion, or &s;en&s;e of Religion could not move, yet at lea&s;t the con&s;ideration of their Countries Defence, or the maintenance of a Bulwark of Chri&s;tendom, might per&s;wade to wage Arms again&s;t the Turk, as a Common Enemy: but what cold Apprehen&s;ions the Chri&s;tian Princes entertained hereof, both the faint Supplies and A&s;&s;i&s;tances they admini&s;tred, and their bloody and vigorous Wars one again&s;t another, have abundantly te&s;tified, to the fatal lo&s;s and ruin of that Country. And though in the beginning there were better hopes, by means of the Pope's earne&s;t interce&s;&s;ion with all the Prin|ces of <HI>Italy,</HI> to whom he &s;hewed a fair Example, by uniting his own Gallies with the Venetian Fleet, and among&s;t the re&s;t prevailed al&s;o with the Republick of <HI>Genoua,</HI> to employ their Gallies in this Noble Enterprize, which tended to the Glory of God, and the common Safety and Pre&s;ervation of <HI>Italy:</HI> yet that Leaven of vain Punctilio's, which hath &s;o often betrayed the Chri&s;tian Cau&s;e to the advantage of the Turk, gave a &s;top for &s;ome time to the&s;e Proceedings. For before they would enter into Arms, they de&s;ired the Genoe&s;es, that the right of bearing the Flag &s;hould fir&s;t be determined in favour of their Admiral, before that of <HI>To&s;cany,</HI> or <HI>Mal|ta:</HI> And though the Pope, to take away this occa&s;ion of di&s;pute, propo&s;ed to have no other Flag worn be&s;ides his own, under which all Ita|lian Princes, without impeachment of their Honour, as Auxiliaries, and Military Adven|turers might promi&s;cuou&s;ly wage War; yet this could not appear &s;atisfactory to the Genoe&s;es, who not only took this occa&s;ion to demand the precedency before <HI>To&s;cany</HI> and <HI>Malta;</HI> to which the G. Duke (who was not inferiour in State, and &s;uperiour in Title) and the Malte&s;es (who time out of mind, and by Decree of <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth, claimed Precedency on the Seas before them) would never a&s;&s;ent; but al&s;o thought fit to avail them&s;elves in this Conjuncture, to obtain from the Pope the Grant of a Royal Court, and that Treatment which is given to Kings, or Crowned Heads. But becau&s;e the&s;e Demands &s;eemed to contain tho&s;e Difficulties in them, which could not be granted without the manife&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure of other Princes, the Pope re&s;olved to afford what a&s;&s;i&s;tance he could from him&s;elf, and therefore granted a Levy of a thou&s;and Foot out of his own Dominions, with free liberty to buy what Ammunition and Pro|vi&s;ions were to be found in the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical State, with impo&s;ition of a double Tithe or Tenth on the Goods and Dominions of the Cler|gy; &s;o that the&s;e Succours of the Pope, and the Auxiliary Forces of <HI>Naples, To&s;cany,</HI> and <HI>Malta,</HI> under the Command of Prince <HI>Ludovi&s;io,</HI> General of the Church, being united to the Ve|netian Fleet, did &s;peedily compo&s;e a mo&s;t pui&s;|&s;ant and formidable Force; however, by rea|&s;on of Di&s;&s;entions among&s;t the Commanders, and other Misfortunes derived from thence, to the Chri&s;tian Arms, nothing &s;ucceeded fortu|nately this Year. For the Turks having gained their landing at fir&s;t without oppo&s;ition, over|threw the Chri&s;tians in &s;everal &s;mall Skirmi&s;hes, and afterwards forced <HI>Canea,</HI> the &s;econd City of that I&s;land, which they took with much blood and &s;laughter of the Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>The Turks having made &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful a pro|gre&s;s this fir&s;t Year, as to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Cities, took Cou|rage to proceed in their Conque&s;ts; in which they had the fortune to make them&s;elves Ma&s;ters in the next place of <HI>Retimo;</HI> in defence of which, the General <HI>Andrea Cornaro,</HI> lo&s;t his Life by a Musket &s;hot. Nor more &s;ucce&s;sful were the Venetians this Year at Sea; for what with Quarrels among the Commanders, and with their coldne&s;s and negligence in their Bu&s;ine&s;s, they &s;uffered the Turki&s;h Ve&s;&s;els to pa&s;s freely, with|out giving them that interruption which was very facil to Men re&s;olute and concerned: Nor was the opportunity which pre&s;ented to ruine the Turki&s;h Fleet made u&s;e of, then lying half di&s;armed, and ill provided, at the I&s;le of St. <HI>Theodoro,</HI> (which is a Rock oppo&s;ite to <HI>Canea</HI>) where at that time, it is believed, they might all have been burned, had the occa&s;ion been im|proved, agreeable to that Advantage which then offered: &s;o that towards the latter end of the Year, the General <HI>Molino</HI> returning Home, either by rea&s;on of &s;ome di&s;temper, or by re|vocation from the Senate, which &s;eemed to be ill &s;atisfied with his ill Fortune, or his ill Manage|ment of the Publick Affairs; he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed
<PB N="62" REF="34">from his high Charge. And <HI>Gio. Capello,</HI> Pro|curator of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> was con&s;tituted in his place.</P>
<P>This Year was remarkable for the ruinous Dif|ferences between Sir <HI>Sackvile Crow</HI> Baronet, our King's Amba&s;&s;ador then re&s;iding at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and the Turky Company. The Original of which &s;eemed to ari&s;e from the Civil Di&s;&s;entions at Home; for &s;o unhappy were tho&s;e Times, and &s;o ill affected were Engli&s;h Minds with Rancour and Malice again&s;t each other, that this Leaven of Di&s;cord could not be confined within the Banks of <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> but &s;eemed to diffu&s;e it &s;elf over the Seas, and as a Conta|gion, infected the Minds, Goods, and Intere&s;ts of the Engli&s;h, to what Quarter or Climate &s;oever they were tran&s;ported.</P>
<P>In the Year 1638, Sir <HI>Sackvile Crow</HI> was, with the Con&s;ent and Approbation of the Turky Company, dignified by his Maje&s;ty with the Ti|tle and Authority of his Amba&s;&s;ador to the Grand Signior. For Maintenance and Support of which, the &s;aid Company were to pay him the yearly Sum of five thou&s;and Zechins, in four e|qual Proportions, which is above the value of two thou&s;and Pounds <HI>Sterling.</HI> And farther, be|fore his departure from <HI>England,</HI> paid him &s;ix hundred Pounds <HI>Sterling</HI> towards the Furniture of his Hou&s;e, Plate, and other Nece&s;&s;aries; de|fraying all the Charges expended for Tran&s;por|tation of his Lady, Followers, and Provi&s;ions to <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>Sackvile Crow,</HI> from the time of his arrival at the Ottoman Court, until the end of the Year 1645, managed the Affairs of the Com|pany to their general Satisfaction, and with the E&s;teem and Honour of the Turki&s;h Mini&s;ters, who con&s;idered him as a Per&s;on of Courage and Re&s;olution, and in every way qualified for that Employment.</P>
<P>At length Differences aro&s;e between this Am|ba&s;&s;ador and the Company, touching the Right and Title to that Benefit which is called<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="marg"><HI>Strangers Con&s;ulage</HI> is <HI>2</HI> in the hundred, in the value of all the goods belonging to Stranger-Merchants, laden on Engli&s;h Ships, and all other Ships which not being in amity with the G. Sig|nior, &s;et up the Engli&s;h Colours, &amp; come under the Engli&s;h Protection, as is law|ful by our Capitula|tions.</NOTE> <HI>Stran|gers Con&s;ulage;</HI> the fir&s;t pretending to the &s;ame on a Grant made to him thereof by his Maje&s;ty, and the Cu&s;tom of Sir <HI>Peter Wych,</HI> and other preceding Amba&s;&s;adors. The others challenging the &s;ame, as the chief and principal Means they had to ea&s;e the va&s;t Expences they were at, for maintenance of their Trade and Government; for which they had always contended and &s;trug|led with the Power of preceding Amba&s;&s;adors, and which Sir <HI>Sackvile Crow</HI> him&s;elf &s;eems, by an Article which he had made with the Company to have relinqui&s;hed to them in the&s;e words.</P>
<P>That during the time of his Employment as Amba&s;&s;ador, he would content him&s;elf with &s;uch Allowance from the &s;aid Company for his Pains and Care to be taken in their Bu&s;ine&s;s, as is &s;pe|cified in the &s;aid Articles, being 5000 Zechins <HI>per Annum.</HI></P>
<P>This Right of <HI>Strangers Con&s;ulage,</HI> is now con|firmed to the <HI>Turky Company,</HI> by virtue of their Charter which his Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed, in the Year of his Happy Re&s;tauration, graciou&s;ly to Re|new, Confirm, and Amplify to them; the which was more ea&s;ily granted, by the concurrent A&s;&s;i|&s;tance of the Right Honourable the Earl of <HI>Win|chel&s;ea,</HI> then de&s;igned for Amba&s;&s;ador to <HI>Con&s;tan|tinople,</HI> who on &s;ome Con&s;iderations offered from the &s;aid Company, a&s;&s;ented thereunto.</P>
<P>But Matters of a higher Nature than this, in|flamed the Accounts and Differences between the Amba&s;&s;ador and Company. For fir&s;t, one <HI>John Wolfe,</HI> at that time Trea&s;urer at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> becoming In&s;olvent for great Sums of Mony, Sir <HI>Sackvile Crow</HI> alledged, that tho&s;e Debts were National, ari&s;ing from the late Changes of State Officers, their extravagant Exactions, and Ava|nious Practices: and therefore to extingui&s;h this Publick Debt, he made a Leviation of one hun|dred and ten thou&s;and, nine hundred and fifty Dollars on the Engli&s;h E&s;tates at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> and <HI>Smyrna,</HI> detaining the Companies Ships in tho&s;e Ports, until the afore&s;aid Debt was &s;atis|fied and cleared. The Ground and Cau&s;e of which, will more plainly appear by this follow|ing Warrant.</P>

<P>WHereas by the unhappy failings of &s;ome of our Nations here, and at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> and through the many late Changes of this State's Officers, and their extravagant Ex|actions on us in tho&s;e Difficulties; and by &s;undry other avanious ways, our Nation is brought into a great Debt: For which We, or tho&s;e, and that E&s;tate which &s;hall remain on the Place, who, and whatever, in ca&s;e of Exigent, and force of Paiment, when-ever that &s;hall happen, mu&s;t (if not otherwi&s;e pro|vided for) in all probability, and according to the rude Cu&s;toms of this State in like ca&s;e, look to be made liable unto.

<P>The <HI>Turkie</HI> Company was altogether unfati&s;|fied with this Leviation, alledging that a great part of this Debt aro&s;e from Monies lent by Sir <HI>Sackvile Crow</HI> him&s;elf to <HI>Wolfe,</HI> at a high In|tere&s;t; for &s;ecuring of which, and of his Prin|cipal, he had in this manner taxed and charged their E&s;tates. But Troubles and Differences ended not with this Paiment; for &s;till the Con|trover&s;y about Strangers Con&s;ulage was de|pending, which with other Matters, cau&s;ed great Heats and Animo&s;ities on both &s;ides: So that &s;ome of the <HI>Turkie</HI> Company, Men of the better Principles, thought it mo&s;t advi&s;able to Petition his Maje&s;ty to con&s;titute another Amba&s;&s;ador, with Letters of Revocation, to recal this; but others, who were the zealous Men of tho&s;e Times, who had ta&s;ted the &s;weetne&s;s of Seque|&s;trations, and proved it to be the Grand Catho|licon of all Remedies, per&s;waded that his E&s;tate &s;hould be Seque&s;tred. This, I &s;ay, may per|haps have been the attempt of &s;ome few; though the generality of the Company have &s;o far di&s;a|vowed the Seizure of his Lands and E&s;tate in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> that they declared them&s;elves ignorant of any E&s;tate he had there. How&s;oever this Appre|hen&s;ion being fixed in the Mind of Sir <HI>Sackvile Crow,</HI> he proceeded to &s;trange Extremities again&s;t the Company: For he not only cau&s;ed all the Goods and Monies belonging to them, within the Grand Signior's Dominions, to be &s;eque&s;tred and &s;eized by his Agents, but al&s;o impri&s;oned the Per&s;ons of all the Engli&s;h Merchants and Fa|ctors which were con&s;iderable, either at <HI>Con&s;tan|tinople</HI> or <HI>Smyrna.</HI> The Particulars of all which will appear with more clearne&s;s by this follow|ing Warrant.</P>

<P>WHereas the <HI>Levant</HI> Company, &s;ome|time before our coming to this Place, by a Court of their A&s;&s;istants, thereunto e&s;pe|cially authorized, treated with &V;s touching a yearly Allowance for our Care and Pains during our re&s;idence here as his Maje&s;ty's Am|ba&s;&s;ador; to be had and taken in &s;uch Parti|culars as might have relation to their Trade and Occa&s;ions: And for a conclu&s;ion of &s;uch Treaty as afore&s;aid, did offer unto us the election of any one of their Agreements, for|merly made with any of our Predece&s;&s;ors in like occa&s;ion. And for a further manife&s;ta|tion of their &s;incerity in their &s;aid Offer, upon our accord thereunto, did, at the Court afore|&s;aid, in publick give into our Hands and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion the Copies of five of their Agree|ments, made with our &s;aid Predece&s;&s;ors, with Power to chu&s;e which of them we &s;hould be&s;t like of, to be a Rule and Pattern for an ab&s;olute Conclu&s;ion and Condition to be drawn up between us and them; thereon al&s;o pro|mi&s;ing that they would make, grant, and con|firm the like unto us. And whereas we there|on, and to the Purpo&s;es and Ends aforemen|tioned, cho&s;e and fixed upon that Agreement, which the &s;aid Company had made with Sir <HI>Thomas Glover,</HI> formerly Amba&s;&s;ador, Re&s;i|dent for the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> with this State: And his Maje&s;ty by his Favour, did a&s;&s;ure the &s;ame unto us, graciou&s;ly promi&s;ing to make his Employment of us here, as good and beneficial in all the Allowances and Per|qui&s;ites thereof, as it had been to any of our Predece&s;&s;ors whoever, and we expected no le&s;s.

<P>To perform and put in execution the fore|going Warrant, it was nece&s;&s;ary to make u&s;e of the Turki&s;h Officers Power, and Authority: Wherefore Sir <HI>Sackvile Crow</HI> demanding Audi|ence of the Grand Vizier, and repre&s;enting Mat|ters unto him in that manner, as he judged mo&s;t agreeable to his Cau&s;e, was heard by him with a gentle and gracious Ear; and a&s;&s;urances made to him of all Re&s;pect, Favour, and A&s;&s;i&s;tance imaginable. For the Turks had now &s;melt out a Cau&s;e in Tran&s;action, which with good im|provement might be worth them many Pur&s;es of Mony; and was of &s;uch a Nature, as that their Religion, and Doctrine, obliged them to nou|ri&s;h, having the pro&s;pect of gaining Mony, and enflaming Chri&s;tian Di&s;cord. On the&s;e Grounds Sir <HI>Sackvile Crow</HI> ea&s;ily obtained Commands from the Vizier, directed to the Kadi of <HI>Smyrna,</HI> to act all things according to direction of him the Amba&s;&s;ador; and to enforce Matters with better execution, a Chaous, or Pur&s;uivant, accompa|nied with <HI>John Hetherington,</HI> and <HI>Lorenzo Zuma</HI> Interpreter, was di&s;patched to <HI>Smyrna,</HI> with Commands to carry up the Con&s;ul and Factors to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and to break open the Ware|hou&s;es, and make &s;eizure on &s;uch E&s;tates belong|ing to the <HI>Turkie</HI> Company, as would an&s;wer the Demands and Pretentions of the Amba&s;&s;a|dor. Accordingly the Con&s;ul and Factory were carried up, and with that other of <HI>Galata,</HI> im|pri&s;oned in the Amba&s;&s;ador's Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Agents at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> with a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Kadi, &s;ealed up all the Merchants Ware-hou&s;es; but when it came to execution and Seizure, more Difficulties aro&s;e; for the Turks, Armenians, and Jew-Merchants, made high Clamours to the Ju&s;tice, that many of the Goods belonged unto them, &s;ome were not yet paid for, others were only Pawns in the Engli&s;h Hands; and all the Town being de&s;irous to fa|vour the Cau&s;e of the Merchants, a great Up|roar and Hubbub aro&s;e among&s;t the People: The Kadi affrighted hereat, grew more &s;lack and faint in his Proceedings; but the Cordial of 1500 Dollars, and Gratuities to his Servants, overcame the Difficulties, and gave him new Re|&s;olution; &s;o that at length, being attended with the Principal Officers of the Town, he began fir&s;t with the Con&s;ul's Hou&s;e, making Sei&s;ure, and delivering out of the Ware-hou&s;es all the Goods found there; with &s;ome Caution how&s;oever, and re&s;pect to tho&s;e Preten&s;ions which Stranger-Merchants made thereunto; as appears by the following Letters.</P>

<P>YE&s;terday we received your Lord&s;hips of the <HI>4th</HI> pre&s;ent, being the Copy of the <HI>3d:</HI> And to day we received your Lord&s;hips's of the <HI>8th,</HI> and rejoice to hear your Lord&s;hip is in &s;uch a readine&s;s for your ju&s;t Demands, and wi&s;h your Lord|&s;hip le&s;s Trouble, and better Succe&s;s than we this day have had, and we doubt for many days &s;hall incounter here. This morning the Cadie's Son, with his Neipe and principal Officers came; and we be|gan fir&s;t with the Con&s;ul's Hou&s;e. But be|fore we began, 'twas &s;poken in the Kad|die's own Hou&s;e, and all over the Town, our De&s;ign to &s;eize what we could find; about &s;even a Clock his Son came and en|tred the Con&s;ul's Hou&s;e, and opened all the Warehou&s;es, and took from thence, with <HI>Elford</HI>'s and <HI>Keeble</HI>'s, &s;ome four hun|dred Clothes, and nine Bales Mohairs; we left behind us 38 Bales of Silk, 13 Bales his Servant pretended were &s;old by his Ma|&s;ter to Mr. <HI>Brent,</HI> to be paid by Bill of Ex|change at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and when advice came the Bills were paid, the Goods &s;hould be delivered; in the mean time they lie in Mr. <HI>Lancelot</HI>'s Warehou&s;e, with &s;ome 40 Clothes, 60 Barrels of Tin, which Tin be|longs to Mr. <HI>Sainthill,</HI> and &s;ealed up by the Neipe and us. Before we had ended at this Hou&s;e, the whole Town was in an Uprore, being fomented by Jews, and &s;ome of the young Fry left behind, and pro|claimed in the Streets, that the Town would be undone, the Trade lo&s;t and go to wrack, if this was &s;uffered; &s;o that be|fore the Con&s;ul's Door were &s;o many of the &s;cum of the Town, the Streets were packed thick of them. On the other &s;ide, a more unruly Enemy threatned wor&s;e things, the Ma&s;ter of the Golden Lion, who had before given <HI>Barnardi&s;ton</HI> 9000
<PB N="66" REF="36">Dollars at <HI>Cambio,</HI> and had no Goods in his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, hearing how it would fare with them, Lands forty Men at <HI>Barnardi&s;tons</HI>'s Hou&s;e, and vowed he would have his Mo|ny or Goods, or &s;wore he would beat down the Town; &s;o likewi&s;e the <HI>Jonas</HI> got her Sails to Yards, that the Kaddie's Son and the Chiouz, de&s;ired to let it alone until a|nother day, for fear of wor&s;e Events: So when they had made an end at <HI>Lancelot</HI>'s Hou&s;e, would &s;tay no longer, but pro|mi&s;ed to come another day.. The E&s;tate before mentioned we carried away in &s;pight of Envy, and have put it up in a &s;afe Cane. As &s;oon as this was done, becau&s;e the Captain would not come a&s;hore, I got <HI>Jordan</HI> to go aboard the Golden Lion, and know the Ma&s;ter his Intent, and to ac|quaint him with the Danger might en&s;ue thereon; all we could urge was nothing, except he had &s;atisfaction for his 9000 Dol|lars; at la&s;t told him, if we knew where his E&s;tate lay, we would endeavour to help him to it; &s;o he found it out, and we delivered it to him, and the Man was ve|ry well &s;atisfied. And now we hope to find little Impediment, and to morrow Morning the Caddie's Son promi&s;eth to come again, and we doubt not the &s;ame day but to make an end. If your Lord&s;hip &s;aw the little regard the&s;e People bear to the Grand Signior's Commands, the Caddie, or ought el&s;e but their private Ends, your Lord&s;hip would (as we hope your Lord|&s;hip will) not blame us if we procured but the half of what your Lord&s;hip's Letter mentions. To morrow (if God ble&s;s us) we &s;hall &s;end your Lor&s;hip more punctual Advice, and for the pre&s;ent crave leave to &s;ub&s;cribe our &s;elves,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Right Honourable,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>OUrs of the <HI>16th</HI> advi&s;ed your Lord|&s;hip, how with the Caddie's Son, his Niepe, and Chia, we had entred the Hou&s;e of Mr. <HI>Lancelott,</HI> and taken into our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion the Goods we found therein, not pretended unto by Strangers; and how by the in&s;olency of <HI>Nicholas Terrick,</HI> Ma|&s;ter of the <HI>Hopewell,</HI> (formerly the <HI>Golden Lion</HI>) we were interrupted that day from proceeding any farther; and how by the means of Captain <HI>Jordan,</HI> we had pacified that young, ra&s;h, and undi&s;creet Man; and that we hoped the next Morning to proceed without interruption, but it fell not our &s;o: for the next Morning we went to <HI>Barnardi&s;ton</HI>'s Hou&s;e, thinking to make all &s;ure there; and when we had begun, in comes the Ma&s;ter with a Crew of his own, and &s;aid, tho&s;e Goods he had recieved were not &s;ufficient to give him &s;atisfaction, and demanded of us the re&s;t. We an&s;wered, We could not give him the&s;e Goods we had &s;ealed up before he came into Port, for wat he demanded; but a&s;&s;ured him if he knew of any thing &s;tanding out, we would endeavour, the be&s;t we could, for his Sa|tisfaction: Upon this, as we under&s;tood &s;ince, a young Man of the Hou&s;e whi&s;|pered the Ma&s;ter in his Ear, and told him, if he were not &s;atisfied before the Goods went out of the Hou&s;e, all was lo&s;t, he would never have a Penny of it: Upon this, away goes the Ma&s;ter aboard, with this young Man in his company, and loo|&s;ed his Sails, but threatned nothing. Upon this come in the Jews, and told the Niepe and the Chia, that the Ma&s;ter would &s;hoot down the Town; but for all our per&s;wa|&s;ions that he dur&s;t not, away runs the Niepe &amp; his Company, and leaves us there alone: &s;o we re&s;olved to have done it our &s;elves; but the Merchants had &s;o worked with the Hamalls, that there was not one to be &s;een; &s;o being alone, and &s;eeing his Boat coming a&s;hore, well mann'd, and fear|ing a &s;urprize, we pre&s;ently repaired to the Chiouzes, and de&s;ired him to go with us to the Caddies, to &s;ee if we could have any better a&s;&s;i&s;tance from him. By this time the Town was in a great Uproar, and the People &s;omething too in&s;olent; the Caddie, to prevent the wor&s;t, pre&s;ent|ly cau&s;ed the Shops to be &s;hut up, and im|mediately &s;ent for all the chief Men of the Town, (who by Pre&s;ents before we had made our Friends) and there before them all, and a great company of the Town&s;men, cau&s;e the Commands to be read, and told them how much they were bound to &s;ee the Grand Signior's Commands put in execution, and what di&s;honour it would be for one Ship to command the Town.. So after they had di&s;puted the Bu|&s;ine&s;s, the Caddie &s;ends an Officer aboard (accompanied with the Druggermen to the Nation) to know whether he would hinder the pro&s;ecution of the Grand Sig|nior's Command, or no, and to know his An&s;wer? He pre&s;ently denied he ever in|tended to &s;hoot at the Town, only de&s;ired his own: So pre&s;ently after the People were a little appea&s;ed, we went to work a|gain, and &s;o this day have fini&s;hed all: it being done in &s;uch confu&s;ion, we cannot give your Lord&s;hip that exact Accompt
<PB N="67" REF="36">you may expect within a day or two; for then we will &s;end your Lord&s;hip the Par|ticulars, with the Values; in mean time we &s;tand upon our Guard, having &s;ome 20 or 30 of the Souldiers of the Ca&s;tle to keep watch every night; for (my Lord!) here is no &s;mall Hobbub in the Town, and threatning both of us and the E&s;tate, but we will &s;ecure both as well as we can. We have &s;ent your Lord&s;hip a rough Draught of what we have, and what we have left &s;ealed up, and find it fall &s;hort far of what your Lord&s;hip expected: the &s;ooner your Lord&s;hip di&s;po&s;es of it, the better; for a&s;&s;ure your &s;elf, there is daily &s;ome De&s;ign or other hatching: We &s;hould be very &s;orry, after all this, to have it mi&s;carry, therefore pray (my Lord!) di&s;po&s;e of it (to prevent the wor&s;t) as &s;oon as you may. Your Lord&s;hip was plea&s;ed to inorder us to change our Lodg|ing, being too near the Water-&s;ide, and in a Merchant's Hou&s;e; which, as &s;oon as we can get a &s;ecure Hou&s;e, we will; but the farther from the Water-&s;ide, the more dangerous, if the People of the Country &s;hould intend us any ill.</P>
<P>The French, and many others, pretend Debts of many of tho&s;e People that are gone up, and would know who &s;hall pay them, and pretend to be paid out of their E&s;tates; but we have put them off, telling them, we believe your Lord&s;hip will hard|ly let your E&s;tate go to pay their Debts; neverthele&s;s, &s;hall advi&s;e your Lord&s;hip of it: &s;o have &s;ecured none, only to one <HI>Hu|zoone Amet</HI> Aga, one of the chief Men in the Town here, Mr. <HI>Lancelott</HI> having gi|ven him a Bill of Exchange for 475 Dol|lars, and the Bill returned unpaid, we were forced to deliver into the Hangee's Hands, for his Security, 10 Cloathes.</P>
<P>We have given the Ships liberty to lade, by rea&s;on of their continual grumbling, but fear our De&s;ign on the <HI>Jonas</HI> will not take; for the Caddie &s;eeing the &s;tubborn|ne&s;s of <HI>Terrick,</HI> will not a&s;&s;i&s;t us as he pro|mi&s;ed.

<P>Matters running thus high, and the Breach made &s;o wide, there remained little hopes of an Accommodation: For now the Merchants at <HI>Galata,</HI> having obtained their Liberty from the Amba&s;&s;ador's Hou&s;e, by the Vizier's Com|mand, entred into a Con&s;ultation in what man|ner to govern their Affairs, electing &s;ome parti|cular Men to that Employment, which they cal|led by the Name of the <HI>Sealed Knot,</HI> which much provoked the Anger of Sir <HI>Sackvile Crow,</HI> and more, becau&s;e that de&s;erting his Protection, they made Applications to the Heer <HI>Coppes,</HI> A|gent for the States of <HI>Holland;</HI> who readily em|braced the defence of their Cau&s;e, and willingly repre&s;ented to the Grand Vizier the Aggrievan|ces, and ill Treatment of which they complain|ed.

<PB N="68" REF="37">Exchange, which was tendred; but the &s;econd day after their arrival, <HI>Hetherington</HI> and his Retinue goes to the Caddie's, and thither cau&s;es the Con&s;ul and all the Nati|on to come; where it was pretended they had laden the <HI>William</HI> and <HI>Thomas</HI> with Corn, and &s;ent her away; and therefore, by virtue of an Imperial Command, (ve|ry privately here procured) the Con&s;ul, and &s;ix more of the Nation, were deli|vered into the Hands of the Chiouz, and &s;o brought up hither, not being &s;uffered to return to their own Hou&s;es, but put a day and a night into an offen&s;ive dark place, the Doors and Windows not only &s;hut, but nailed upon them, not &s;uffering either their Friends or Servants to come at them, or a Window open till the evening, for which al&s;o they paid Dollars 100. In this di&s;graceful manner they were brought hither, where they have been &s;ince the <HI>22d</HI> of the la&s;t Month, Pri&s;oners in his Lord&s;hip's Hou&s;e to the <HI>21&s;t</HI> pre&s;ent, not|with&s;tanding they had complied in paying the Leviation Monies in le&s;s than a Week after their arrivals; and by fair Promi&s;es, put off from day to day, for their di&s;patch to their Bu&s;ine&s;s at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> which could not but much &s;uffer by their ab&s;ence: Their magazines and Counting-hou&s;es continued &s;ealed from the time of their Attachments; the Spips not permitted to lade, or depart, though empty; and no Debts due to them would be paid in this their Ab&s;ence and time of Di&s;traction.</P>
<P>The Leviation Monies being &s;atisfied, (of which Dollars 31000, his Lord&s;hip forced into <HI>Cancellaria</HI>); and we of <HI>Smyr|na</HI> expecting no more rubs in the way, his Lord&s;hip, the <HI>16th</HI> In&s;tant, calls a Court, and there declared, That of what Monies had been collected, there would not remain much on the old Accompt; therefore pro|vi&s;ion mu&s;t be made for the future growing Charge, for &s;o much as upon this pretended Imbargo, no Ships would come in ha&s;te, and he and his mu&s;t be maintained, which he would provied for: Hereupon, when we could not do otherwi&s;e, Dollars 25000 was promi&s;ed, half by this Factory, for which his Lord&s;hip cau&s;ed us to enter into Bond, as he did tho&s;e of <HI>Smyrna</HI> for the other half; this being effected, which we &s;hould not neither altogether have been &s;o ready to have complied in, but thereby to put a period to all other Demands, and en|able our &s;elves to proceed in our Bu&s;ine&s;s for your Wor&s;hips better Service.</P>
<P>The <HI>18th</HI> pre&s;ent his Lord&s;hip calls a|nother Court; and after arguing of &s;ome General Matters, with a &s;eeming &s;adne&s;s, tells us how that he had been wronged by fal&s;e Information from hence and <HI>Smyrna,</HI> (but he was &s;o far from proving it, as that he would not di&s;cover &s;o much as whom he &s;u&s;pected) and thereupon the <HI>Levant</HI> Company at Home had, by means of the Parliament, procured Seque&s;tration of his E&s;tate and Lands in <HI>England,</HI> and endea|voured to &s;urprize his Per&s;on; and there|fore, according to Religion, Rea&s;on, and common Policy, he ought to &s;ecure him|&s;elf and his Ho&s;tages; and thereupon he departed from us, requiring the Nation &s;peedily to re&s;olve of &s;ome pre&s;ent Sati&s;|faction that might &s;ecure his E&s;tate at Home, and per&s;on here, otherwi&s;e he vowed to God, he would &s;uddenly do it him&s;elf, with no little di&s;advantage to our &s;elves and Principals. The&s;e &s;trange, unrea&s;onable, and unexpected Demands, filled us with amazement, not knowing what An&s;wer to give to &s;uch a groundle&s;s demand; we de&s;ired the Secretary Signior <HI>Dominico</HI> to know his Lord&s;hips more par|ticular De&s;ires therein, that &s;o we might better under&s;tand him, and to put his De|mands into &s;uch a moderate way, as he might receive &s;ome Satisfaction. He re|turned us An&s;wer, that we mu&s;t re&s;olve to &s;atisfy his afore&s;aid Demands before we went thence: Whereupon the Gates were &s;hut, and al&s;o Guards &s;et upon us, that we &s;hould not conver&s;e with any, or convey &s;o much as a Paper out of Doors. Thus we are all &s;urprized, made clo&s;e Pri&s;o|ners, and our Counting-hou&s;e, Ware-hou&s;e, and Chambers &s;ealed up, to make &s;ure of our Goods and E&s;tates there al&s;o. Conti|nuing in this &s;ad Condition all Night, and finding no Motion to proceed from his Lord&s;hip to declare him&s;elf farther, four or five of us was appointed by the genera|lity, per&s;onally to crave his Lord&s;hip's particular De&s;ires and Demands of us: Who&s;e An&s;wer was, That the lowe&s;t va|lue he could put upon his Lands the Com|pany had &s;eque&s;tred, was 25000 pounds <HI>Sterling;</HI> and for the lo&s;s he &s;hould &s;u|&s;tain by being put out of the Amba&s;&s;ador|&s;hip, which he &s;aith his Maje&s;ty hath granted him for his Life; therefore the Strangers Con&s;ulage he rates at Dollars 5000 <HI>per Annum;</HI> which for the clear Gain of &s;even Years to come, is Dollars 35000; for which he declared that he would not accept of any Per&s;onal Security or Obligation what&s;oever, but a pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition of Dollars 160000 in Mony or Goods, into his own hands mu&s;t be made. And if to this we would not conde&s;cend, he told us, That he at the la&s;t Sacra|ment had vowed to God (as he doth now) to &s;acrifice his E&s;tate, Him&s;elf, Wi&s;e and Children, for the execution of this his ab&s;olute Intent; and till then, neither our Per&s;ons, E&s;tates, Ships here, or at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> &s;hould be free. We told his Lord&s;hip, that finding not any of us had heard of any &s;uch Things was (or intended to be) done again&s;t him by the Company, it would give us great Satisfaction, to &s;hew
<PB N="69" REF="37">us tho&s;e Advices he grounded this Pretence upon. To this no An&s;wer was then gi|ven by him&s;elf, but di&s;mi&s;&s;ed us, leaving it to our la&s;t and &s;peedy Re&s;olution, be|cau&s;e he was re&s;olved to &s;trike home. Im|mediately after he &s;ent us word by a &s;e|cond, That he could not let his Honour de&s;cend &s;o low, as to &s;hew his Advices to any. This empty Reply, gave us too much rea&s;on, not only to conclude this to be a feigned Pretence, but made us &s;ufpect his Intention and Aim was at all the Na|tion's E&s;tate in the Country; and there|fore we returned him this rea&s;onable and defen&s;ive An&s;wer, as your Wor&s;hips will particularly perceive by the inclo&s;ed Pa|per: whereunto is adjoined his Reply to that our An&s;wer, as he pretended; tho it appears it was intended before, it being dated a day before our An&s;wer. Whil&s;t thus we continued, it happened that tho&s;e four of us were fortunately ab&s;ent from Court that day, who hearing of our Con|ditions, wherefore, and why we were thus detained, and what an ill Period the&s;e Proceedings tended unto, if not timely and prudently prevented; they u&s;ed their be&s;t endeavours to free us and your Livelihoods from the Claws of Ty|ranny and Covetou&s;ne&s;s; they applied them&s;elves to Signor <HI>Illu&s;tri&s;&s;imo Coppes,</HI> the States of <HI>Hollands</HI> Agent: who as he was ever a Friend and Favourer of the Nation, &s;o now he gave us good and great te&s;timo|ny thereof in this our greate&s;t Need and Extremity: and chiefly by his means with a Sum of Mony; together with the Cla|mors of the Jews, and many other of the Grand Signior's Subjects again&s;t this our pre&s;ent Abu&s;e, and de&s;truction of future Trade: The Vizier (whom they had well and &s;ully po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the Truth of all Things) after three days Impri&s;on|ment, &s;ent a Chiouz for us to his Lord|&s;hip's Hou&s;e, from whence we were car|ried before the Vizier, who much up|braided his Lord&s;hip, &s;aying, He never gave him Commands for &s;uch Proceedings, notwith&s;tanding his Lord&s;hip's avaneous Allegations again&s;t his own Nation, by &s;aying, an Engli&s;h Ship at <HI>Smyrna</HI> was la|den with Powder, Ammunition, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and there re&s;ided for a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Turks Enemies; and other the like Abu&s;es, and de&s;tructive Cour&s;es again&s;t tho&s;e here; tending not only to the confi&s;cation of Ships and E&s;tates, but the ri&s;go of en|&s;laving our Bodies, if not the lo&s;s of all or &s;ome of our Lives, had his Helli&s;h Plots taken effect. The next day after our ge|neral Commitment, arrives five more of our fellow Factors from <HI>Smyrna,</HI> there &s;eized upon and made Pri&s;oners; and &s;o by his Lord&s;hip's Command, in that nature brought to his Hou&s;e, and put among&s;t us, notwith&s;tanding the advice from, their Corre&s;pondents hence was at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> (be|fore their departure thence) that their part of Leviation Mony was all paid in here; yet their Leviation, with one third more in Monies and Goods, was takne a|gain from them by his impudently impi|ous Mini&s;ters there, and all the re&s;t of their Goods continued &s;ealed up: So the Intent (as your Wor&s;hips may plainly perceive) was no other than fir&s;t to get the Monies here paid, then to &s;eize upon their Per|&s;ons, and next to take away and &s;ecure their E&s;tates; thereby to prevent a ju&s;t, rea&s;onable, and natural Defence; and now it too plainly appears, (becau&s;e his Lord|&s;hip's Imployers had taken cour&s;e no Me&s;|&s;engers &s;hould come unto us); Hor&s;emen are daily di&s;patched unto us by our Friends at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> advi&s;ing us to the <HI>20th</HI> In&s;tant, of the unnatural and devouring Progre&s;|&s;ions they had there made; which was done by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Caddie, whom they had well bribed, beginning to act there at the &s;ame time as we were here all impri&s;oned; &s;o there was no intent of &s;taying for our An&s;wer to his extravagant Demands. They fir&s;t fell upon Mr. <HI>Lan|celot</HI>'s Hou&s;e, thence proceed all through|out the Nation; &s;o that they have not on|ly taken away all the Goods, Monies, and Effects what&s;oever they could find in their Hou&s;es, at Home or Abroad, but broke open and ran&s;ack'd all our Chambers, Trunks, and Counting-hou&s;es, which mounteth to a far greater value than his demands of Dollars 160000; and by large Promi&s;es to Informers, endeavour to di&s;|cover and take what is owing them abroad by People of the Country; and have &s;o threatned our Friends and Servants to de|liver our Books, and declare where's more of our E&s;tates, that they are con&s;trained to leave our naked Hou&s;es to the open World, and betake them&s;elves to the Ships in Port for Refuge. All this it &s;eems contents them not, but are contriving Provi&s;ions, by policy and force of &s;ome Rogues of the Country, to unlade what Goods the Na|tion had put on board the <HI>Jonas.</HI> For all which, we have not only the advice of our di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Friends there, but &s;uch in|fallible Information, as your Wor&s;hips may perceive by the inclo&s;ed authentick Co|pies of Letters from his In&s;truments at <HI>Smyrna</HI> to his Lord&s;hip here; by which you will too plainly perceive his Lord&s;hip did, and &s;till doth aim at all the E&s;tate the Nation had in the Country; and for that cau&s;e he was &s;o much enraged for the de|parture of the <HI>Hercules,</HI> and <HI>William</HI> and <HI>Thomas,</HI> who&s;e Goods he e&s;teemed as &s;o much lo&s;s to him.</P>
<P>We have been now &s;even days out of his Lord&s;hip's hands, and are endea|vouring to free that E&s;tate they have al|ready taken at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> as al&s;o to defend
<PB N="70" REF="38">our Selves and your E&s;tates in future from him, and free the Ships out of Port, (which no que&s;tion at la&s;t will be proved have been detained by his Lord&s;hip to this ill pur|po&s;e) and if po&s;&s;ible, to procure the re|turn of Dollars, 20 in 30000, his Lord|&s;hip hath unavoidably forced from us in the Leviation Accompt, upon &s;trange Preten|ces. All which (by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of our obliged and worthy Friend <HI>Signior Illu&s;tri&s;|&s;imo Coppes;</HI> together with the expence of Dollars 30 in 40000, to the Vizier and o|ther Turki&s;h Mini&s;ters) we doubt not but &s;peedily to effect; for without this ho|ne&s;t defen&s;ive Remedy, we can expect no|thing but ruin to all your E&s;tate in the Country, which &s;till he threatneth, and endeavours by all his devili&s;h Policy and Means to effect: But the Vizier, and the two Caddeleskiers, who are our Judges, are &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;t with the Truth and Rea&s;on of our Cau&s;e, as well by the People of the Country, as our Selves, that they have given us full a&s;&s;urance, by Promi&s;es, Pro|te&s;tations, and &s;ound Probabilities, that our ju&s;t Demands &s;hall be accompli&s;hed; for which we all faithfully and earne&s;tly endeavour Night and Day, and &s;o do hourly expect a good determination of it: and till there be an I&s;&s;ue or Settlement given to this our confu&s;ed Condition, (which we hope will not continue for many days) no particular Principal mu&s;t expect Advice from any Factor here, becau&s;e no private Man can fitly advi&s;e any thing, till the ge|neral Bu&s;ine&s;s be better ordered: And as we proceed therein, we &s;hall by all Ways and Conveyances give your Wor&s;hips a true and exact Account. We do humbly be&s;eech your Wor&s;hips to acknowledg the good Offices of the State's Agent to their Amba&s;&s;ador with you, and &s;o fully certify him, that Illu&s;tr. Sign. <HI>Coppes</HI> appeared no ways again&s;t his Lord&s;hip as Amba&s;&s;ador, or trenching on the King's Honour, but re&s;pectfully and mode&s;tly for the &s;afety of your E&s;tates.</P>
<P>To particularize all Pa&s;&s;ages and Cir|cum&s;tances in this Bu&s;ine&s;s, would prove more trouble&s;om than needful to your Wor&s;hips, &s;o plea&s;e to accept of this Re|lation; for this is the pre&s;ent &s;tat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> of yours and our Condition; which though not &s;o well as we could wi&s;h, yet better than we could imagine; for the Hand was up, the Match lighted, and a little more time would have blown up all, We need not put your Wor&s;hips in mind &s;peedily to &s;end us another Protector, &s;eeing the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of your Occa&s;ions craves it too plain|ly; and in confidence of your &s;peedy Re|&s;olution thereof, we &s;hall continue, hoping our De&s;ires will be &s;atisfied, and the E&s;tates in better &s;ecurity, by his &s;peedy arrival here, which God in Mercy grant.</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip's Cau&s;e is &s;o bad, that Signor <HI>Dominico</HI> your Secretary, Signior <HI>George,</HI> and all other Druggermen, have not only declined his Lord&s;hip, but apply them&s;elves to us, (and e&s;pecially the for|mer). In fine, we conceive his Lord&s;hip finds his former bad Proceedings have made him uncapable to return into <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and al&s;o uncertain of his Re&s;idence here; which, together with the improvi|dent u&s;e he hath made of his Golden Time, that he intended to &s;eize upon all He and his unworthy In&s;truments could catch hold of; for to this purpo&s;e he diverted the <HI>Gol|den Fleece</HI>'s advantagious De&s;ign for <HI>Venice;</HI> which at fir&s;t was approved and cau&s;ed by his own con&s;ent; and occa&s;ioned her Fa|ctor here, to whom &s;he was con&s;igned, to let her him to fraight, that &s;o Him&s;elf, Fa|mily, and undue gotten E&s;tate, may be conveyed (as in &s;uppo&s;ed) into <HI>France,</HI> with who&s;e Amba&s;&s;ador, there hath been often a more than ordinary corre&s;pondency of late.</P>

<P>Before the &s;ealing up of our Letter, we have procured an Imperial Command for the recovering of the E&s;tate into our Hands, taken away at <HI>Smyrna;</HI> as al&s;o for the attaching the Per&s;ons, and bringing tho&s;e good Agents of his Lord&s;hips hither, to an&s;wer their Proceedings and Behavi|our: the obtaining of which Command, we are not a little glad of, being our Obli|gatory Te&s;timony of the Vizier's being our Friend, and ties him thereby to conti|nue &s;o, which we hope effectually to find, two days hence, when his Lord&s;hip is to appear with us before him; but in ca&s;e he refu&s;eth (as already he hath done) the Vizier will give Sentence again&s;t him.</P>

Where|upon, we generally de&s;ired that his Lord|&s;hip would be plea&s;ed to &s;u&s;pend the exe|cution of the &s;aid Order of Leviation, un|til &s;uch time we &s;hould receive your Wor|&s;hips farther Order about it, without which we our &s;elves were like to pay it out of our own Pur&s;es, as in the la&s;t Leviation; receiving &s;ince particular Orders from &s;ome of our Principals, not to pay any Levia|tions, otherwi&s;e it &s;hould be for our own Accompts, and not theirs.</P>
<P>The <HI>24th</HI> of <HI>April,</HI> the Con&s;ul called another Court, &s;ignifying unto us, that his Lor&s;hip did require an account for the departure of the Ship <HI>William</HI> and <HI>Thomas,</HI> and <HI>Succe&s;s,</HI> contrary to his Lord&s;hip's Commands, there being an Officer of the Vizier's come down to apprehend Captain <HI>Tho. Porter,</HI> and to carry him up to <HI>Con|&s;tantinople,</HI> (which Ships departed at their own plea&s;ures, being not in our powers to &s;tay them.) And that concerning the Le|viation it was inevitable, and his Lord&s;hip was re&s;olved upon it, and therefore would force us unto it, and expect repair of Ho|nour from the Delinquents. Whereupon fear|ing his Lord&s;hip's farther di&s;plea&s;ure, which might beget &s;ome greater Inconveniences among&s;t us, we pre&s;umed to yield unto his
<PB N="72" REF="39">Lord&s;hip's Commands, by way of a &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive orderly complyance, and conform our &s;elves unto the paiment of our parts of the &s;aid Leviation, in proportion to the E&s;tates were received on the la&s;t general Ships, <HI>Hercules, Samp&s;on,</HI> and <HI>Smyrna-Merchant,</HI> according to our particular A&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ments; as appeareth by our general Letter pre&s;ented to his Lord&s;hip, and entred in Cancellaria, grounded upon the re|&s;ult of this days Court; de&s;iring his Lord|&s;hip would be plea&s;ed to allow us four Months time for paiment, for &s;uch Rea|&s;ons as we have alledged in the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The <HI>6th</HI> of <HI>May,</HI> the Con&s;ul told us he had received other Letters from his Lord|&s;hip, prohibiting not only the Lading of Goods, and the Departure of any Ships, until the Leviation be &s;etled; but al&s;o therein more fully &s;ignifies and declares, That until the Grand Signior's Fleet be gone forth, he cannot permit any Ship, either at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> or here, to lade or be di&s;patched; and that accordingly his Lord&s;hip is &s;o required of this State. And in like manner hath ordered and com|manded tho&s;e whom it concerns, both a|bove, and in this Port, to ob&s;erve the &s;ame. And moreover farther witne&s;&s;ing, which accordingly (as he &s;aid) he was bound to acquaint us, how that the Em|bargo at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and here, was &s;e|conded; and his Lord&s;hip, to avoid far|ther Dangers and Inconveniences to the Publick, could not refu&s;e his Con&s;ent there|unto.</P>
<P>The <HI>10th</HI> of <HI>May</HI> arrived here Mr. <HI>John Hetherington,</HI> a Servant to his Lor&s;hip, and Signow <HI>Lorenzo Zuma</HI> a Greek, one of his Lord&s;hip's Druggermen, from <HI>Con&s;tan|tinople;</HI> who the next Morning moved our Con&s;ul to call a Court for the Nation; where being a&s;&s;embled, the Con&s;ul told the &s;aid <HI>Hetherington</HI> and <HI>Lorenzo,</HI> That their De&s;ires were performed, and there|fore required them to deliver what they had in Commi&s;&s;ion from his Lord&s;hip: who produced an Order of the <HI>27th</HI> of <HI>April,</HI> directed to the Con&s;ul and Us, for paiment of the &s;aid Leviation forthwith, or el&s;e to proceed according to his farther Order, Warrant, and In&s;tructions in &s;uch behalf; and we to be an&s;werable to &s;uch Lo&s;s, Damage, and Inconveniencies as may en&s;ue thereby. To which we an&s;wered, That the Leviation was &s;ub&s;cribed unto, and therefore de&s;ired the &s;aid <HI>Hehterington</HI> and <HI>Lorenzo</HI> to &s;tay four or five days, until his Lord&s;hio &s;hould return An&s;wer to our Letter of the <HI>24th</HI> of <HI>April.</HI> The &s;aid <HI>Lorenzo</HI> told us, He would retire and per|u&s;e hsi Lord&s;hip's Commi&s;&s;ion, and in two hours return, to have a more full and &s;atisfactory An&s;wer from us: which being expired, he declared, That his Lord&s;hip's Commi&s;&s;ion required forthwith ready Mony or Goods, (being hsi In&s;truction, from which he could not vary). Where|upon Mr. <HI>John Lancelot</HI> fir&s;t an&s;wered, (as he was a Merchant) He could not depo|&s;it his Cloth, for his Credit's &s;ake, but would give his Bills for his and Mr. <HI>Dix|well Breat</HI>'s proportionable part of the Le|viation, payable at <HI>Con&s;tantinople per</HI> Mr. <HI>Thomas Pigot,</HI> at five days &s;ight, into his Lord&s;hip's <HI>Cancellaria;</HI> which was refu&s;ed, unle&s;s they would depo&s;it the value in Cloth, and one third part more towards Charges, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of him the &s;aid <HI>Lorenzo;</HI> which they &s;aid again, for their Credits &s;ake (as they were Merchants) could not con&s;ent unto; &s;o referred them|&s;elves unto the &s;aid <HI>Lorenzo</HI>'s farther pro|ceedings, if the&s;e Proffers would not be accepted of, being not po&s;&s;ible for them at pre&s;ent to procure Monies at Intere&s;t, or otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>The like Conditions we all in general proffered for our proportionable parts, but were refu&s;ed by the &s;aid <HI>Hetherington</HI> and <HI>Lorenzo.</HI> Whereupon the Con&s;ul told them, they had all our A&s;&s;ents for pai|ment of the Leviation; and if that, with &s;uch Rea&s;ons and Proffers as propound|ed, might not be &s;atisfactory, the Con&s;us, and we in general, referred our &s;elves to the &s;aid <HI>Lorenzo</HI>'s farther Proceedings.</P>
<P>After this, the &s;aid <HI>Hetherington</HI> and <HI>Lorenzo</HI> pre&s;ently repaired to the Cad|dies, accompanied with a prime Chiouz of the Vizier's, and declared their farther Commi&s;&s;ions: After publication whereof, the Caddie &s;ent for the Con&s;ul, and all our Nation, where the Capitulations were fir&s;t taken away by Warrant, and the Con|&s;ul in a mo&s;t barbarous manner was laid hold on, with <HI>Dixwell Breat, Daniel Ed|wards, John Pixley, Samuel Barnardi&s;tion, George Hanger,</HI> and <HI>James Moyer,</HI> and com|mitted Pri&s;oners into Cu&s;tody of the &s;aid Chiouz and Officers, and tran&s;ported to a Hou&s;e (taken by them on purpo&s;e) where they were violently, and in a for|midable manner, thru&s;t into a dark Cham|ber, and at length were forced to pre&s;ent Dollars 300, to have a Window &s;et open to give them Light and Air; the Con&s;ul telling the &s;aid <HI>Hetherington</HI> and <HI>Lorenzo,</HI> before he was &s;urpri&s;ed, in the pre&s;ence of the Caddies, That neither he, or the Na|tion, had any ways tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the Grand Signior's, or his Lord&s;hip's Commands, and that he did not fear what they could do unto him, no not &s;o much as to die, in performance of his Faith and Tru&s;t to the <HI>Levant</HI> Company, whom he had truly &s;erved; as likewi&s;e for his Love and Affe|ction he bore to the Nation here under his Charge, whom he would never betray, hoping &s;hortly to &s;ee his own Country a|gain, And in two hours after, the &s;aid <HI>Hetherington, Lorenzo,</HI> and Chiouz, Caddie,
<PB N="73" REF="39">and Neipe, &s;ealed up all the Counting|hou&s;es, Magazines, and &s;ome Chambers; and in two days after, tran&s;ported the Pri|&s;oners over-land up to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> where they were delivered to his Lord|&s;hip's Power and &s;afe Cu&s;tody; we in the mean time being left like &s;o many Sheep without a Shepherd, and ignorant where to &s;eek protection.</P>
<P>The next day after departure of the&s;e Pri&s;oners, the &s;aid <HI>Hetherington</HI> and <HI>Lo|renzo</HI> &s;ealed up our Cloth in our own Warehou&s;es, for what concerned our pro|portionable part of the Leviation, at the rate of Dollars 45 <HI>per</HI> Cloth, and one third part more towards Charges.</P>
<P>The <HI>18th</HI> day of <HI>May,</HI> at the in&s;tance of the &s;aid <HI>Hetherington</HI> and <HI>Lorenzo,</HI> the remainder of us left here behind met to|gether, where the &s;aid <HI>Hetherington</HI> told us we had not brought in our Bills of Ex|change for <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> for the parts of our Leviation, and one third part more; unto which we an&s;wered, We had com|plyed with his Lord&s;hip's Commands, in all willing and obedient manner, accord|ing to our pre&s;ent Po&s;&s;ibilities, until we &s;hould be able to &s;atisfy the &s;ame with our ready Monies here, or by our Bills payable in <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> at five days &s;ight, where|in we promi&s;ed to u&s;e our utmo&s;t Endea|vours, hoping to redeem our Cloth again, which we had depo&s;ited, and they &s;ealed up for our proportionable Parts of the Leviation.</P>
<P>In few days after arrived here one of the principalle&s;t Chiouzes of the Grand Signior, with new Commands &s;ent down by his Lord&s;hip; by virtue whereof the &s;aid <HI>Hetherington</HI> and <HI>Lorenzo</HI> &s;eized upon the Per&s;ons of <HI>John Ball, Henry Davey, Phillip Farwell, Nathaniel Barnardi&s;ton,</HI> and <HI>John Ingoldsby,</HI> who were committed Pri&s;oners to the &s;aid Chiouz, who u&s;ed them with &s;ome humanity, and &s;ent up the next day to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> to be deli|vered unto his Lord&s;hip's Power; after who&s;e departure (all Law being &s;et a&s;ide) the &s;aid <HI>Hetherington</HI> and <HI>Lorenzo</HI> by this Command came down, opened all our Warehou&s;es, and by Violence carried all our Goods away into &s;everal Canes of the Truks; as well what they had &s;ealed up, for the Leviation, as all other Goods of what nature &s;oever they could find, unle&s;s it were &s;uch as was &s;ealed up, and be|longed to Turks, and other of the Grand Signior's Subjects; and left many of us &s;o bare, that we had not wherewithal to af|ford us a piece of Bread to keep Life and Soul together, only bare Promi&s;es. The &s;aid Chiouz remaining behind, put us daily into great Fears that we &s;hould all be &s;ent up, or clapt up here in Pri&s;on, which cau&s;ed many of us to repair on board the Ship for Succour, here being in Harbour the Ships <HI>Rainbow, Jonas, Hope|well,</HI> and <HI>Triangle.</HI></P>
<P>In all which time of this Di&s;traction and Sufferings, our Mi&s;eries have been much condoled by the chief Turks and Inhabitants of this Place, who &s;eem to &s;ympathize with us in our &s;ad Conditions; and had not the Commands been &s;o powerful, the whole Town would have ri&s;en up in our Defence and Protection, who have privately advi&s;ed of the&s;e A|bu&s;es; which as they them&s;elves confe&s;s, are like to ruin, not only this Scale, but that of <HI>Aleppo</HI> and <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> al&s;o, to the Di&s;honour of the Grand Signior, and ruin of many of his Subjects; and of a profitable and acceptable Friend (our Na|tion) to become a potent Enemy again&s;t them.</P>
<P>The <HI>28th</HI> of <HI>June</HI> came Letters from <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> advi&s;ing the Vizier's Or|der for re&s;cuing both Factories from his Lord&s;hip's Impri&s;onment, and particular Advice to &s;ome of us here left, for appre|heading the Per&s;ons of the &s;aid <HI>Hehtering|ton</HI> and <HI>Lorenzo,</HI> and to keep them in &s;afe Cu&s;todies on board our Ships, fearing (we having no Order as yet to receive our E|&s;tates out of their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions) they might convey our &s;aid E&s;tates away, or &s;ell them for half their Worth, and &s;o make their private e&s;capes out of Town, ex|pecting daily a Chiouz to carry up their Per&s;ons to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and to free our Goods, hoping all will go well again for us. Hereupon the very &s;ame day, the &s;aid <HI>Hetherington</HI> and <HI>Lorenzo,</HI> (without any noi&s;e or rumour) were by the Mari|ners conveyed on board &s;everal Ships from the &s;aid <HI>Hetherington</HI>'s Lodging, <HI>viz.

<P>But not to in&s;i&s;t long on a Subject &s;o ungrate|ful, as the Difference was between the Amba&s;&s;a|dor and his Merchants; the Conclu&s;ion, and I&s;|&s;ue of all was this. After Sir <HI>Sackvile Crow</HI> had &s;pent at the lea&s;t &s;eventy thou&s;and pieces of Eight of good ready Mony, and the Turky Company two hundred thou&s;and; the Turks finding the Amba&s;&s;ador's Exchequer to be almo&s;t exhau&s;ted, for that Pre&s;ents and Pur&s;es of Mony came not in &s;o plentifully as at fir&s;t; and on the contrary, feeling the Spring of the Levant Com|panies Trea&s;ury &s;till to run fre&s;h and quick, their Inclinations towards the Amba&s;&s;ador grew more cold and faint, his Agents were not admit|ted &s;o readily to Audience as formerly, nor his Petitions and Addre&s;&s;es received with that can|dor, as when Mony and Intere&s;t made their en|trance ea&s;y; in the mean time, the Merchants were heard with great patience, their Cau&s;e and Complaints e&s;teemed rea&s;onable; and in &s;hort, Sir <HI>Sackvile Crow</HI> was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from <HI>Con&s;tantino|ple,</HI> in a manner not u&s;ual for Amba&s;&s;adors, nor agreeable to that Quality and Character: and was &s;ucceeded by Sir <HI>Thomas Bendy&s;h,</HI> who was Authorized and con&s;tituted in that Emba&s;&s;y, by Commi&s;&s;ion from his Maje&s;ty King <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t of ever ble&s;&s;ed and glorious Memory.</P>
<P><HI>Gio Capello</HI> being con&s;tituted General in the place of <HI>Molino,</HI> as we mentioned at end of the preceding Year, departed from <HI>Venice</HI> ear|ly in the Spring, having under his Command fifty Gallies, &s;ix Gallea&s;&s;es, and forty Ships of War, and four Fire-&s;hips, be&s;ides other Ve&s;|&s;els, which are nece&s;&s;ary Attendants on &s;o great an Armata; which grand Preparations rai&s;ed the Minds of the Chri&s;tian World to ex|pect the abatement of the Ottoman Pride, and other Effects equal to the magnificent O&s;tenta|tion, and triumphing Glory of this mighty Power: But God, who gives not always Succe&s;s to the Powerful, nor the Battel to the Strong, was not, it &s;eems, &s;o well &s;atisfied for the Sins of Chri&s;tendom, as to judge it worthy to be delivered from the Scourages of its Grand Op|pre&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t <HI>Capello</HI> remained with the be&s;t part of the Fleet at <HI>Candia, Toma&s;o Moro&s;ini,</HI> Admiral of the Ships, &s;hewed him&s;elf in a Bravado with twenty two Sail before the Ca&s;tles of the <HI>Helle|&s;pont,</HI> called the <HI>Dardanelli,</HI> defying the whole Turki&s;h Power, with Colours flying, and Drums beating: nor did they dare to an&s;wer the bold Challenge, until in a dead Calm, &s;ome few light Gallies pre&s;ented them&s;elves in a &s;eeming Bat|tel, with whom, for want of Wind, the Ships were on the di&s;advantage, and rather received Prejudice than gave it; &s;o that both &s;ides were contented with the Action.</P>
<P><HI>Moro&s;ini</HI> withdrew from that Station, and re|turned to his General at <HI>Candia;</HI> to whom having joined his Forces, he earne&s;tly per&s;wad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d him, together with the Proveditor <HI>Grimani,</HI> to engage the Turki&s;h Fleet, which they a&s;&s;ured him was much inferior to them, both in num|ber of Ve&s;&s;els, and in Skill and Courage of the Combatants; and that the Succe&s;s of this Year con&s;i&s;ted in the cutting off the Enemies Suc|cours, which was their &s;ole Relife and Depen|dance, without which they could not longer maintain the Ground they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, but mu&s;t deliver up that and them&s;elves to their plea&s;ure. But the cautious General would not a&s;&s;ent to this Re&s;olution, judging it over-ra&s;h and preci|pitate; for that the Fortune of <HI>Candia,</HI> and o|ther I&s;les of the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> was not to be ha|zarded on the Succe&s;s of one Battel.</P>
<P>During which Di&s;pute, and irre&s;olution of Affairs, the Turke&s;h Fleet, con&s;i&s;ting of three hundred Sail, arrived at <HI>Canea,</HI> where they landed forty thou&s;and fighting Men, which tur|ned the Scale of the War, and rendred the Turks &s;o powerful, as not ever more to be ex|pelled, or their Off-&s;pring extirpated from the Confines of that I&s;land. By this time the Pope's and <HI>Malta</HI> Gallies were come to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and united with the Venetians; &s;o that <HI>Capello</HI> &s;etting &s;ail from the Port of <HI>Suda,</HI> re&s;olved to en|gage the Enemy at St. <HI>Theodoro;</HI> which was ef|fected accordingly, though with little Succe&s;s, for the Turks had fortified them&s;elves, and &s;e|cured their Gallies with that advantage, that they could not be a&s;&s;aulted without great hazard of the Chri&s;tians; and when they endeavoured to burn them, their four Fire-&s;hips took fire too &s;oon, and proved of more fear and a&s;toni&s;hment to the Truks (to whom this Invention was as yet unknown) than of real dammage. After this the Venetians returned again to <HI>Suda,</HI> where having intelligence that thirty Turki&s;h Gallies, with Men and Provi&s;ion (which they had col|lected in &s;everal parts of the <HI>Archipelago</HI>) were on their Voyage to <HI>Canea, Capello</HI> preparing to intercept them with a Force of Gallea&s;&s;es and Gallies, and leaving <HI>Grimani</HI> and <HI>Moro&s;ini</HI> to com|mand the main Body of the Fleet, he in per&s;on bent his Cour&s;e towards <HI>Cerigo.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> Pa&s;ha departed from <HI>Canea,</HI> in order to his return to <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople,</HI> with fifty &s;even light Gallies, two Ships, two Gallea&s;&s;es, and many Saiks; but meeting in his Pa&s;&s;age with a hard &s;torm of Northerly Winds, he lo&s;t &s;even of his Gallies, and &s;everal other Ve&s;&s;els, &s;o that he re&s;olved to divide his Fleet, and &s;end part of them to <HI>Scio,</HI> and him|&s;elf with the other part to make for <HI>Negropont.</HI> This Fleet was followed by &s;ome other Ve&s;&s;els under the Command of <HI>Mahomet Celebee,</HI> Bro|ther of the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Algier,</HI> who being as far in his way as the narrow Streights of <HI>Andra,</HI> he was there &s;topped by the Fury of the Northern Winds, (which are the Ma&s;ter-Winds of tho&s;e Seas) and by the impetuous rage thereof, was carried to the I&s;land of <HI>Zia;</HI> where having gi|ven Licence to the greate&s;t part of his Souldiery to Land, they carele&s;ly &s;trayed abroad, and without &s;u&s;picion of Surprize, merrily pa&s;&s;ed their time in eating and drinking. In the inte|rim, advice hereof being carried to <HI>Toma&s;o Moro|&s;ini,</HI>
<PB N="75" REF="40">then with &s;ome Ships in the Port of <HI>Mi|lo,</HI> he immediately, without lo&s;s of time, ap|plied him&s;elf to a&s;&s;ault the Turks; and being followed by the Proveditor <HI>Grimani,</HI> he took two of their Ships, whil&s;t <HI>Mehmet Celebee,</HI> with about two hundred of his Men, betook them|&s;elves to the weak &s;helter of an old demoli&s;hed Fort, and afterwards &s;urrendred them&s;elves to the di&s;cretion of the Conqueror.</P>
<P><HI>Moro&s;ini</HI> and <HI>Grimani,</HI> encouraged with this Succe&s;s, re&s;olved to pur&s;ue the Enemies Fleet; in order unto which, <HI>Moro&s;ini</HI> fir&s;t putting out to Sea, was in&s;tantly carried away by a fierce gale of Wind towards <HI>Ambro,</HI> and &s;eparated from the re&s;t of his Fleet, and thence again was to&s;&s;ed by the impetuo&s;ity of the Storms unto <HI>Rafti;</HI> of which <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> Pa&s;ha having Intelli|gence, made ha&s;te to attack this &s;ingle Ve&s;&s;el, with forty Gallies; giving order to the Bey of <HI>Rhodes,</HI> to lay him aboard with fifteen Gallies, the &s;tronge&s;t and be&s;t armed of all their Squadron: <HI>Moro&s;ini</HI> nothing di&s;mayed, bearing the &s;ame con&s;tancy of Mind in the mid&s;t of his Enemies, as at a di&s;tance, boldly &s;hewed him&s;elf on the Quarter Deck, encouraging his Men with his words, and by his Example, to Actions wor|thy their Religion, Faith, and Country for which they contended. The Turks continued for &s;ome time to batter the Ship at a di&s;tance with their Cannon, but with little dammage to the Chri|&s;tians; who returned their Shot to better ad|vantage. Hereby the Turks perceiving that Blows given &s;o far off did little Execution, re|&s;olved to Board the Ve&s;&s;el, and &s;ubdue Her by force of Arms, and being come to the &s;ide of the Ship, the Souldiers were fearful to enter, &s;u&s;pecting &s;ome trains of Powder to blow them up, until <HI>Emurat,</HI> one of the Captains, &s;truck off the Head of one or two of his own Men, whom he perceived backward in the A&s;&s;ault, which affrighted the re&s;t into the greater danger, and forced them to enter the Ship, who were &s;oon followed by the Gallies of the Bey of <HI>Rhodes,</HI> of <HI>Milo,</HI> of <HI>Mehmet</HI> Bey, and others; &s;o that now two hundred of the Enemy were Com|bating with Swords and Half Pikes upon the Deck;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Moro&s;ini</HI> flair.</NOTE> in which &s;torm, <HI>Moro&s;ini</HI> fighting among&s;t the thicke&s;t, was &s;hot through the Head with a Musket Bullet, and &s;o gloriou&s;ly fini&s;hed his Days in the Service and Defence of his Coun|try; gaining to him&s;elf a Laurel, and an Im|mortal Name of Glory and Renown.</P>
<P>The Chri&s;tian Souldiers little regarding all this time the fall of their General, &s;toutly maintained their Fight, in which they received encouragement from the pro&s;pect they had of two Gallea&s;&s;es making ha&s;te to their Succour; at who&s;e nearer approach, the Turks de&s;i&s;ted from their farther Attempt; being unwilling to purcha&s;e a Victory at the dear rate it would co&s;t them.</P>
<P>The Body of <HI>Moro&s;ini</HI> was tran&s;ported to <HI>Venice,</HI> and his Ob&s;epuies Celebrated in a man|ner more Triumphant than Funebrous; the Pro|veditor <HI>Grimani</HI> was likewi&s;e declared Captain General in the place of <HI>Capello;</HI> who having, as it were, Be&s;ieged the Ca&s;tles at the Mouth of the <HI>Dardanelli,</HI> taken &s;everal places in the <HI>Ar|chipelago,</HI> and put the Enemies Fleet often unto flight, he thereby, and by other Acts of Va|lour, rendred him ju&s;tly renowned through all Chr&s;tendom.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the chief and mo&s;t memorable actions by Sea, performed this Year; Tho&s;e by Land were acted chiefly in <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> where the Turks poured in their Forces on the Venetian Dominions, but were bravely repul&s;ed by <HI>Leo|nardo Fo&s;colo,</HI> who took <HI>Ali</HI> Bey Pri&s;oner, the Commander in Chief of the Sangiac of <HI>Licca,</HI> and &s;lew his Son; be&s;ides which, he took <HI>Sac|covar, Poli&s;&s;ano, I&s;lan,</HI> and other Fortre&s;&s;es and Ca&s;tles, full of Arms and Ammunition, which were the Magazines of the Country; he al&s;o recovered <HI>Novegrade</HI> out of the hands of the Turks, which was afterwards demoli&s;hed by Order from the Senate; which Victories were followed with other Succe&s;&s;es; nothing being able to oppo&s;e the Valiant and Pro&s;perous Arms of <HI>Fo&s;colo;</HI> for be&s;ides the taking and &s;acking of &s;everal other Forts and Ca&s;tles in <HI>Dalmatia, Obraozzo, Carino, Otti&s;&s;ian, Velino, Nadino, &V;|rana, Tino,</HI> and <HI>Salona,</HI> in the Confines of <HI>Croa|tia,</HI> and <HI>Bo&s;na,</HI> became a Prey to the Venetian Arms.</P>
<P>But to this &s;ucce&s;sful Progre&s;s of the War, a &s;top was given for &s;ome time by the &s;ickne&s;s of <HI>Fo&s;colo;</HI> in which interim, the new Pa&s;ha of <HI>Bo&s;na,</HI> called <HI>Mahomet Techli,</HI> a Circa&s;&s;ian born, a Per&s;on both Generous and Valiant, with an Army of forty thou&s;and Men, be&s;ieged the &s;trong Fortre&s;s of <HI>Sebenico;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sebenico</HI> be&s;ieged.</NOTE> but was bravely repul&s;ed by the Valour of the Inhabitants, the very Women exceeding the imbecillity of their Sex; and Children and old Men, with the weak|ne&s;s of their Age, &s;trengthened them&s;elves with Re&s;olution again&s;t their Enemies, and &s;o valiantly behaved them&s;elves in defence of their City, that the Turk was forced to rai&s;e his Siege, having gained nothing but the lo&s;s and &s;laughter of many of his People, and the be&s;t of his Souldiery; whereby he gained an a&s;&s;u|rance of the Invincible Strength of that place, and the Valour of the Inhabitants.</P>
<P><HI>Fo&s;colo</HI> in like manner recovering his Health, continued the un-interrupted cour&s;e of his Victo|ries, and thereunto added the taking of <HI>Scar|dona;</HI> &s;o that in <HI>Dalmatia</HI> the Venetian Affairs ran &s;o pro&s;perou&s;ly, that nothing could be de|&s;ired to render them more happy and glorious. For the Turks not only were expelled from the Confines of <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> but likewi&s;e that Pro|vince became more quiet and &s;ecure than ever it had been in the Times of Peace.</P>
<P>But the joy of the&s;e Succe&s;&s;es was very much allayed by the unhappy Fate of a great part of the Venetian Fleet, at the I&s;land of <HI>P&s;ara;</HI> which being lanched from <HI>Candia</HI> with inten|tion to a&s;&s;ault the Turks within the <HI>Dardanelli,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The ruin of the Venetian Armata at <HI>P&s;ara.</HI></NOTE> unfortunately were driven by contrary Winds to that un&s;ecure &s;hore; where contending with a mo&s;t furious Storm, a great part of the Fleet was ca&s;t away, and the General <HI>Grimani</HI> him|&s;elf drowned. About which time, the Turks, for the greater Terror of the Chri&s;tians, laid clo&s;e Siege to the City of <HI>Candia,</HI> and made many and various Attempts thereupon, carry|ing on their A&s;&s;aults with the height of bra|very and Re&s;olution, the Particulars of which require a di&s;tinct Hi&s;tory; but by the invincible Fortitude and Courage of the Chri&s;tians, they were repul&s;ed with that &s;laughter, and with the lo&s;s of &s;o many Men, by Sallies and other Stra|tagems of War, that the Turks were at length con&s;trained to rai&s;e their Siege with di&s;honour and confu&s;ion; during which time many of the Nobility and Per&s;ons of Quality lo&s;t their Lives; among&s;t which, the principal were, <HI>Vicenzo della Marra,</HI> Governour General of the Arms of <HI>Candia,</HI> and Count <HI>Remorantino,</HI> natural Son of the Duke of <HI>Loraine,</HI> Comman|der in Chief of the Forces that came from be|yond the <HI>Alpes.</HI></P>
<PB N="76" REF="41">
<P>General <HI>Fo&s;colo</HI> encouraged by the many glo|rioes Enterpri&s;es that he had obtained, re&s;ol|ved to con&s;ummate all by taking the &s;trong and famous Fortre&s;s of <HI>Cli&s;&s;a,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cli&s;&s;a</HI> ta|ken.</NOTE> &s;cituate in the Con|&s;ines of <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> and Borders of <HI>Bo&s;na,</HI> on the top of a &s;harp and craggy Mountain, invironed with Rocks and unacce&s;&s;ible Pa&s;&s;ages; the diffi|culty of the attempt rather inflamed than abated the Courage of <HI>Fo&s;colo,</HI> &s;o that he Valiantly Be|&s;ieged and A&s;&s;aulted that Place; during which time, the Prie&s;t <HI>D. Stephano Sorich.</HI> Captain of the Morlachs, intercepted the Succours which were &s;ent thither, and <HI>Georgio</HI> the Proveditor, overthrew <HI>Teccbeli</HI> Pa&s;ha in a Field Battel; &s;o that the Inhabitants de&s;paring of Relief, &s;urren|dered up them&s;elves to the mercy of the Ve|netians; and thus <HI>Cli&s;&s;a</HI> being taken, the Se|nate Commanded that it &s;hould be more regular|ly Fortified.</P>
<P>And here the Chri&s;tian Arms met &s;ome inter|ruption. For the Morlachs de&s;irous to ca&s;t off the Turki&s;h Yoke, and return to the protection of the Venetians, de&s;igned to &s;urprize <HI>Scutari;</HI> and at the &s;ame time the Arch-bi&s;hop of <HI>Duraz|zo,</HI> with &s;even thou&s;and Albanians, was to &s;eize upon <HI>Croia,</HI> and <HI>Ale&s;&s;io;</HI> but the De&s;ign being di&s;covered by the traiterous practices of &s;ome fal&s;e Brethren, before Matters were ma|turely grown, or the time of Execution, it had certainly co&s;t the Life of all the Morlachs, and &s;even hundred Venetian Souldiers joined with them, had not the increa&s;e of the Waters hin|dered the &s;peedy March of the Turks, who re|&s;olved to cut them all off without mercy, who re|gard to any; &s;o that having time to di&s;per&s;e them&s;elves, and take refuge in the Mountains, the mo&s;t of them pre&s;erved their Lives from the Cruelty of their Enemies; only &s;ome certain Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Per&s;ons falling into their Hands, they imputed unto them the cau&s;e of the Rebel|lion, and in a barbarous manner impaled them on Stakes.</P>
<P>The Turks enraged for the lo&s;s of <HI>Cli&s;&s;a,</HI> di&s;patched <HI>Dervis</HI> Pa&s;ha into the parts of <HI>Bo&s;na,</HI> with a potent Army, threatning to A&s;&s;ault <HI>Spa|latro;</HI> whom to divert, <HI>Fo&s;colo,</HI> together with Prie&s;t <HI>Sorich,</HI> Captain of the Morlachs, entered into the Enemies Country; &s;poiling, burning, and de&s;troying where&s;oever they came. The Morlachs more greedy of Prey than ambitious of Glory, divided them&s;elves into &s;mall Parties to rob and pillage; in which interim they were a&s;&s;aulted by the Turks, but being &s;cattered, were &s;o far from making a &s;tout re&s;i&s;tance, that they committed them&s;elves to a &s;hameful flight, in which great numbers of them were mi&s;erably Butchered; nor could the valour of <HI>Sorich,</HI> nor of the Governour <HI>Po&s;&s;idaria,</HI> reduce them by their Examples into any Order: whil&s;t to|gether with &s;ome few valiant Dalmatians, and Morlach Captains, they endured the &s;hock of all the Enemies Fury; in which Skirmi&s;h the Turks lo&s;t &s;even Agas, and about &s;eventy Soul|diers: On the Chri&s;tians &s;ide were killed four hundred, &s;ome few Slaves, and about &s;eventy En&s;igns taken; among&s;t the re&s;t the good Prie&s;t <HI>Sorich</HI> &s;corning to turn his back, had the mi&s;|fortune to fall into the Enemies hands, whom they flead alive, and afterwards impaled; and though they &s;ubdued his Body, yet he was &s;till ma&s;ter of his mind; bearing the &s;ame con&s;tan|cy in his Torments, as he had &s;hewed Magnani|mity and Courage in the Face of his Enemy.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e Martial Affairs were tran&s;acting, with the Blood and Life of many thou&s;ands on both &s;ides, Sultan <HI>Ibrahim,</HI> like a &s;tout Souldier of <HI>Venus,</HI> waged another War in the Ely&s;iums of <HI>Cupid;</HI> and ca&s;ting a&s;ide all thoughts of <HI>Candia,</HI> remitted the &s;ole care and management thereof to the Vizier and Pa&s;has of the Divan; following a Life &s;o la&s;civious and &s;en&s;ual, as can neither be imagined with a cha&s;t Fancy, or de&s;cribed by a mode&s;t Pen.</P>
<P>A principal In&s;trument of his Delights, and Engine to compa&s;s his Amorous De&s;igns, was a certain ca&s;t Wench of his, which he named <HI>She|chir Para,</HI> which &s;ignifies a little piece of Sugar; for it &s;eems &s;he was &s;o complai&s;ant and dulcid in her Humour and di&s;cour&s;e, as merited that apt Name to expre&s;s the &s;weetne&s;s of her Con|ver&s;ation; this Woman having the conve|nience to vi&s;it all the Baths in Town, took notice of every Woman which &s;he &s;aw of more than ordinary Features and Proportion, and having enquired her Condition and Dwelling, pre&s;ently reported the &s;ame with all advantage to her Sul|tan, who having heard the Beauty de&s;cribed, be came pa&s;&s;ionately Enamoured, and could find no repo&s;e in his Fancy, until his In&s;truments, either by fair words or violence, had &s;educed her, or forced her to his Bed. But growing now ex|travagant and over-wanton in his Amours, he fell in love with the Sultana, or Widow of his Brother Sultan <HI>Morat:</HI> To win her Affections he had recour&s;e to his Dear <HI>Shechir Para;</HI> who u&s;ed all her Arts in this Service: but her pretty wheedling Terms could prevail nothing on this Lady, who an&s;wered her in &s;hort, That at the Death of her Lord Sultan <HI>Morat,</HI> &s;he had re&s;ol|ved upon a perpetual Widowhood, for that the memory of him was &s;till &s;o lively in her, that &s;he could not entertain the thoughts of admit|ting any new Embraces. This repugnancy and oppo&s;ition inflamed the heat of <HI>Ibrahim</HI> like a Feaver, &s;o that he re&s;olved to a&s;&s;ault her him&s;elf one day by force, and took his time ju&s;t as &s;he came out of the Bath; but &s;he being a bold Wo|man, and di&s;daining the wandring loves of <HI>Ib|rahim,</HI> laid her hand upon her Dagger, (which Sultana's and great Ladies u&s;ually wear) threat|ning to wound him in her own defence; the noi&s;e and brawling hereof being over-heard by the Queen-Mother, called her from her Retire|ments, and concerned her in the Quarrel; who whil&s;t &s;he reproved her Son, for the rape he in|tended on his Brother's Wife, gave opportunity to the Sultana to e&s;cape; and &s;o delivered her out of the hands of this Satyr. But <HI>Ibrahim</HI> mad with love, and fuming with di&s;dain to be checked and oppo&s;ed by his Mother, Command|ed her immediately to the old Seraglio, where he confined her to &s;everal days Impri&s;onment, during which time he under&s;tood in what man|ner &s;he had treated his large-&s;iz'd Armenian, of whom we have already &s;poken; whereof the Queen-Mother being con&s;cious, &s;ubmitted her &s;elf with all humility to her Son, begging his Favour and Pardon; and &s;o well acted her part by tho&s;e who carried her Addre&s;&s;es, that &s;he over came quickly his ea&s;y Nature, and was again re&s;tored to his Grace, and her Lodgings in the new Seraglio.</P>
<P>In the mean time <HI>Shecher Para</HI> travelling over all the Baths in Town, to di&s;cover new delights for her Ma&s;ter, at length had the fortune to ca&s;t her Eyes on a Daughter of the Mufti, a Maid of Incomparable Beauty and Features of Counte|nance, and proportion of Body, which &s;he re|ported to <HI>Ibrahim</HI> &s;o &s;en&s;ibly, as if &s;he her &s;elf had been in love; and after &s;he had prai&s;ed every Part and Member of her, &s;he concluded in &s;um, that &s;he was the mo&s;t Excellent and admirable
<PB N="77" REF="41">Piece that ever Nature framed. The Sultan had no &s;ooner heard the Story, but according to his u&s;ual Cu&s;tom, fell mo&s;t de&s;peratly in love, and had immediately, without farther con&s;ideration or coun&s;el, di&s;patched his Emi&s;&s;aries; or with|out other Preamble, Ceremony, or Court&s;hip, to have fetched her to him; had not the &s;en&s;e of the late Rebuff he had received from his Bro|ther's Wi&s;e, made &s;ome inpre&s;&s;ion of fear in him; and the apprehen&s;ion he had of the Power of the Mufti, created in him a certain Caution and Re&s;pect in the treatment of his Daughter: wherefore he rather re&s;olved to &s;end for the Mufti, with whom he treated of honourable Terms concerning Marriage; promi&s;ing to take her into his Bo&s;om, and prefer her in Honour equal to any other of his Sultana's.</P>
<P>The old Man who was tender of, and doated on his Daughter, knowing well the wandring humour of the Sultan in his Amours, intended rather to marry her to &s;ome great Per&s;onage, with whom &s;he might be more happy, than in being a Soltana: for he con&s;idered, that <HI>Ibra|him</HI> having already other Sons, her I&s;&s;ue would either be Sacrificed for &s;ecurity of their Bro|thers, or el&s;e &s;pend their days in a Pri&s;on, and become Grey-headed, whil&s;t they breath in a <HI>medium</HI> between Life and Death, and are &s;ad Reclu&s;es in the Grave of their unhappine&s;s. The&s;e con&s;iderations were well imprinted in the mind of the Mufti: but becau&s;e he dur&s;t not deny his propo&s;al, he dealt with him as Inferi|ours u&s;ually do with their Lords and Superious; that is, he returned him thanks, expre&s;&s;ing infi|nite Obligations, that he would vouch&s;afe to ca&s;t his Princely Eyes on the unworthine&s;s of his Family: however he advi&s;ed him, that accor|ding to the Canons of their Law, of which he was the Expo&s;itor, and obliged to be a &s;evere and preci&s;e Ob&s;erver; it was great Impiety in a Father to impo&s;e on the Affections of his Child; &s;o that though he could heartily wi&s;h that his Daughter would embrace this Honour, to which he would exhort her with all the ear|ne&s;t Per&s;wa&s;ions of a Father; yet if &s;he proved refractory thereunto, it would not be becoming his Power to force her; and therefore hoped his Maje&s;ty would believe, that in proceeding thus far, he had performed that Duty which be|came him, both as a Father, and a Loyal Sub|ject.</P>
<P><HI>Ibahim</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing that by this Conce&s;&s;ion he had gained his De&s;ign, thanked and imbraced the old Man, whom di&s;mi&s;&s;ing with plenary &s;ati&s;|faction, he remained now with an impatient ex|pectation, and hopes of enjoyment. Next Morn|ing the Mufti returned early to the Grand Sig|nior, and having fir&s;t &s;ufficiently in&s;tructed his Daughter to refu&s;e the Sultan's Proffers, told him plainly, that he had u&s;ed all his paternal Au|thority and intere&s;t with his Daughter, that he might induce her to accept this mighty Fortune, which ca&s;t it &s;elf upon her; but that it found not that ready acceptance with her as he expect|ed; what could be the rea&s;on he knew not how to conjecture, &s;ince Women are commonly ir|regular, and unrea&s;onble in their Affections.</P>
<P><HI>Ibrahim</HI> being in this manner di&s;appointed, and more angry to encounter any boundary or re|&s;traint to the imperious violence of his Lu&s;ts, than oppo&s;ition again&s;t the pui&s;&s;ance of his Arms; di&s;mi&s;t the Mufti with &s;ome neglect and di&s;dain, whom he re&s;olved to treat with Rigour, and his Daughter with Court&s;hip. In order to the fir&s;t, he bani&s;hed him the Count, and forbad him his pre&s;ence in any other place; grew &s;ullen and un&s;atisfied at all his admini&s;tra|tions of Ju&s;tice, intending thereby to induce him to a re&s;ignation of his Office, there being nothing more irk&s;ome to an ingenuous Spirit, than to &s;erve and not to plea&s;e. On the other &s;ide he dealt with the young Lady in a different manner, by the crafty and flattering in&s;inuations of his tru&s;ty <HI>Shechir Para,</HI> who &s;o forcibly man|naged her Tongue full of curious Words, mix|ed with Threats, repre&s;enting the Storms and Fury of the Sultan's Rage; and again, the Glo|ry, Splendour, and Happine&s;s of the Seraglio; where &s;he &s;hould Reign as Empre&s;s and Sove|raign of the World: all which &s;he expre&s;&s;ed with that pa&s;&s;ion, and la&s;civious enticement, as would have &s;haken a firmer Con&s;tancy, than the Vertue of a Turki&s;h Maid: but &s;he being well admoni&s;hed by her Father, remained ob&s;tinate in her Denial: but to quiet the importunity of this Seducer, &s;he begged her not to &s;ollicite her Father in this Reque&s;t, but rather that &s;he would intercede in her behalf with the Sultan &s;pplica|ting him with all humility to pardon her Childi&s;h refu&s;al, and to leave her unto her unto her own Liberty and Choice, and a &s;ingle Life: to ob|tain which favour from her, &s;he produced a Dia|mond of con&s;iderable value, de&s;iring her to ac|cept of that from her, and to become her Friend, her A&s;&s;i&s;tant, and Protectre&s;s. <HI>Shechir Para</HI> be|ing overcome by her Maiden Mode&s;ty, could no longer re&s;i&s;t &s;uch forcible Entreaties; and having her Eyes ob&s;cured with the lu&s;tre of the Jewel, promi&s;ed to change her Note, and ex|cu&s;e her refual with the advantagious and compa&s;&s;ionate Terms po&s;&s;ible; and &s;o taking her leave with a courteous farewel, repaired to the Sultan, to give an account of her Negotia|tions.</P>
<P><HI>Ibrahim,</HI> having with more doubtful Fear at|tended the I&s;&s;ue of this la&s;t Conference, than he did the Succe&s;s of his War with <HI>Venice;</HI> re|ceived his <HI>Shecher Para</HI> with exceeding joy, who being come in, began to recount all the Particu|lars that had pa&s;&s;ed: but the &s;um of all was, that this &s;illy Maid was &s;ufficiently &s;en&s;ible of the honour of being a Soltana, of being Cour|ted by his Maje&s;ty, of the Joys, Delights, and Glory of the Seraglio; but that when &s;he re|flected, how that &s;he was to bring forth Chil|dren to die by untimely Deaths, and to end their Days by Poi&s;on, or the Bow-&s;tring, or at lea&s;t to live mi&s;erable Lives &s;eparated from Man|kind, and immured within Walls, and Intombed whil&s;t they breathed; &s;he could not but trem|ble with &s;ome horrour, and judg, that all the blandi&s;hments of Worldly Fortune were but a tran&s;ient Paradi&s;e; which could not po&s;&s;i|bly recompence, or out-weigh the &s;en&s;e and tenderne&s;s &s;he conceived for the mi&s;ery of her unfortunate Off-&s;pring. How&s;oever &s;he &s;o cou|ched her Di&s;cour&s;e, that &s;he gave <HI>Ibrahim</HI> &s;ome hopes to overcome at length; by which &s;he ap|pea&s;ed a little his Fury and De&s;pair, and ex|tracted &s;ome Jewels and Gifts in reward of her pa&s;t Labour, and encouragement for her future Service. In this manner <HI>Ibrahim</HI> had patience a|while, expecting &s;omething farther from the in|du&s;try of <HI>Shecher Para;</HI> but finding no effect of all his expectations and gentlene&s;s, at length re|&s;olved to break through all Con&s;iderations of Re&s;pect, either to the Father as the Mouth and Oracle of the Law, or to the &s;imple and fooli&s;h innocence of the Maid; and therefore ordered the Great Vizier to cau&s;e a Watch to be &s;et on the Girl, either going in, or coming out of the Bath, and without farther Ceremony to bring
<PB N="78" REF="42">her unto him. This Order being executed ac|cordingly, and the Maid hurried to the Serag|lio; <HI>Ibrahim</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and enjoyed her for &s;ome days, but with tho&s;e Tears, Reluctancy, and Sullenne&s;s, as tood off from the edg and appe|tite of Enjoyment; &s;o that he returned her back again with &s;corn and contempt unto her Father; who at fir&s;t di&s;&s;embled the injury with the &s;ame Countenance as he did before, when he was interdicted the Sultan's Pre&s;ence; &s;up|pre&s;&s;ing his revenge like a concealed Fire, which bur&s;ts out afterwards with more violent Flames. But though the &s;en&s;e of Obedience and Duty to|wards his Prince allayed much of the choler he conceived again&s;t him for the Rape of his Daugh|ter, yet he knew not how to pardon the Great Vi|zier, whom he termed no other than a Ruffian or Pandor; the Mini&s;ter of his Ma&s;ter's Lu&s;ts, and not of his Laws, and of Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Thus full of indignation he applyed him&s;elf, and made his complaint unto one <HI>Mahomet</HI> Pa&s;ha, a principal Member of the Divan; one of great Wi&s;dom and Practice in the Conduct of Affairs, and one with whom he had a particular Friend|&s;hip and Intimacy. Nor le&s;s intere&s;t had he with Jani&s;ar-Aga, or General of the Janizaries; to both whom, with tears in his Eyes, and with &s;uch words as the &s;en&s;e of his injuries &s;ugge&s;ted, he railed at the Vizier, and aggravated the Ra|vi&s;hment of his Daughter with all the circum|&s;tances of Villany and Violence.</P>
<P>The&s;e two Friends heard the Story with a &s;en&s;ible remor&s;e, and immediately concluded, That for the Honour and Security of the Em|pire, it was nece&s;&s;ary to depo&s;e Sultan <HI>Ibrahim,</HI> and for the &s;ame Rea&s;on to cut off the fir&s;t Vi|zier; agreeing among&s;t them&s;elves that <HI>Maho|met</HI> Pa&s;ha &s;hould receive the Seal and the Office. To effect which, they deemed it nece&s;&s;ary to draw the Qneen-Mother into the Con&s;piracy, being a Woman of great Authority, and having, as it were, the Reins of Government in her Hands, by rea&s;on of the weak Judgment of her Son. But becau&s;e it was difficult to per&s;wade the tenderne&s;s of a Mother to the ruin of her Son, the wi&s;e Mufti re&s;olved fir&s;t to &s;ound her Inclinations and di&s;po&s;ition towards this De&s;ign: and being well informed of her fierce Circa&s;&s;ian Nature, and the Jealou&s;y and Anger &s;he con|ceived again&s;t <HI>Shechir Para,</HI> obtained Licence to be heard by her, as if he would beg her Inter|ce&s;&s;ion with her Son in his behalf; and being admitted to di&s;cour&s;e with her, he thereby plain|ly di&s;covered her mo&s;t inveterate hatred and di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t her Son; not only for this, but for many other Actions of like nature.</P>
<P>This di&s;covery which the Queen had made, gave him the boldne&s;d to propo&s;e the confine|ment again of <HI>Ibrahim</HI> to his old Pri&s;on; not that he &s;hould be ab&s;olutely laid a&s;ide and depo|&s;ed, but only corrected awhile, and being put in remembrance of his pa&s;t Condition, might be tanght Wi&s;dom, and in&s;tructed for the future, what moderation and ju&s;tice Sultans are obliged to exerci&s;e in the Admini&s;tration of Govern|ment; and &s;o &s;ubtilly did he in&s;inuate his Di&s;|cour&s;e, that the Queen-Mother a&s;&s;ented to the Propo&s;al, and that the Seal &s;hould beconferred on <HI>Mahomet</HI> Pa&s;ha; for &s;he had conceived an irreconcileable hatred again&s;t <HI>Achmet</HI> the Grand Vizier, by who&s;e Coun&s;el &s;he was &s;ent to the old Seraglio, and was united in Confederacy with the dete&s;ted <HI>Shechir Para.</HI></P>
<P>The Mufti greatly &s;atisfied to have gained &s;o con&s;iderable a Con&s;pirator to the Party, com|municated the whole Bu&s;ine&s;s, with the Pro|gre&s;s of it, to the two Kadile&s;chers, or Lord Chief Ju&s;tices of <HI>Romelia</HI> and <HI>Anatolia;</HI> who ap|proving thereof, and promi&s;ing their utmo&s;t a&s;&s;i|&s;tance, the <HI>7th.</HI> of <HI>Angu&s;t</HI> was the Day appointed for the In&s;urrection of the Janizaries, who being all in a readine&s;s on that day, went in a tumul|tuary way to call the Mufti, the Kadile&s;chers, and other Officers and Mini&s;ters of the Law, whom they &s;eemingly forced to accompany them to the pre&s;ence of the Grand Signior, of whom they demanded, that the pre&s;ent Vizier <HI>Achmet</HI> &s;hould be deprived of his Office, and that <HI>Ma|homet</HI> Pa&s;ha &s;hould be con&s;tituted in his place. The Grand Signior at fir&s;t refu&s;ed their De|mand, but being per&s;waded by his Mother that it was nece&s;&s;ary to content the Militia in that tumult; he con&s;ented thereunto, and having called <HI>Achment,</HI> he took from him the Seal, and conferred it on <HI>Mahomet</HI> Pa&s;ha, and therewith the Office of Grand Vizier. <HI>Achmet</HI> trembling at the con&s;equences hereof, re&s;olved to commit him&s;elf to the Mercy of the Mufti, and there|fore ha&s;tned to his Hou&s;e to attend his return, hoping to find him his Protector, under who&s;e Shadow and Roof he fled for Sanctuary.</P>
<P>The Souldiery having thus obtained the fir&s;t-fruits of their In&s;urrection, accompanied the Mufti unto his Home, where finding the depo|&s;ed Vizier <HI>Achmet,</HI> the Jani&s;ar-Aga immediately Commanded him out of Doors, from whence he had no &s;ooner drawn his Foot, than that he was &s;eized upon and &s;trangled, and his Body thrown before the Gate of the new Mo&s;ch.</P>
<P>The next day being the <HI>8th</HI> of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1648, the Janizaries again ari&s;ing in the like Tumult as before, came to demand of the Mufti, Whe|ther that according to their Law, Sultan <HI>ibrahim</HI> as a fool, and a Tyrant, and unfit for Govern|ment, ought not to be depo&s;ed? To which the Mufti giving An&s;wer in the Affirmative, &s;ent to cite Sultan <HI>Ibrahim</HI> the day following to appear in the Divan, to admini&s;ter Ju&s;tice to his Soul|diers and Subjects, who expected it from him. But <HI>Ibrahim</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing that he had &s;ufficiently &s;atisfied the Souldiery, by putting the Vizer out of Office, laughed at the Summons which the Mufti made him; which being &s;econded by a Fetfa, which is a point of Law re&s;olved by the Mufti, who is the Mouth or Oracle thereof, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Grand Signior being called to ac|count, is obliged to appear before the Ju&s;tice; the Sultan in high di&s;dain tore the Paper, threat|ning the Head of the Mufti: but it was now too late he having already &s;ufficiently fortified him&s;elf with the Power and Strength of his Rebellious Companions. This Fetfa was immediately &s;e|conded by another of a higher nature, which declared, That who&s;oever obeyed not the Law of God, was not a true Mu&s;&s;ulman or Believer; and though that Per&s;on were the Emperor him|&s;elf, yet being become by his fithy Actions a Kafir or Infidel, was <HI>ip&s;o facto,</HI> fallen from his Throne, and no farther capable of Authority and Government. This Fetfa being &s;een by <HI>Ibrahim,</HI> he tore it in pieces, commanding the Grand Vizier in&s;tantly to put the Mufti to Death, as guilty of Trea&s;on again&s;t his Prince: but having now lo&s;t his Authority, his Commands were not longer regarded, nor any reverence had of his per&s;on: For the Janizaries being again a&s;&s;embled about five a Clock in the Afternoon, came with their u&s;ual tumult to the Gates of the Seraglio.</P>
<P>And now Sultan <HI>Ibrahim</HI> lo&s;ing all Courage at this third attempt, fled into the Arms of his Mother, begging her A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Protection.
<PB N="79" REF="42">She being a bold and &s;ubtle Woman, employed all her Rhetorick and Eloquence to per&s;wade the Souldlery not to offer Violence to the Per&s;on of their Lord and Ma&s;ter; promi&s;ing that he &s;hould relinqui&s;h the Government, and retire him&s;elf with a Guard into his old Lodgings. <HI>Ibrahim</HI> comforted a little, that he &s;hould &s;ave his Life, &s;hrunk him&s;elf willingly into his old Shell, wherein he had &s;o long con&s;erved his Life.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Con&s;pirators taking forth his elde&s;t Son Sultan <HI>Mahomet,</HI> &s;et him on the Throne of his Father, and planting the Sar|gouch, or Imperial Feathers on his Head, &s;alu|ted him for Emperor with loud Acclamations. <HI>Ibrahim</HI> continued his Impri&s;onment for &s;ome days with great patience, but at length growing de&s;perate and furious, often beat his Head a|gain&s;t the Wall, until at length, he was on the <HI>17th</HI> &s;trangled by four Mutes.</P>
<P>In this manner Sultan <HI>Ibrahim</HI> ended his Days, which puts me in mind of the &s;aying of a wi&s;er and a better King than he, <HI>That there is little di|&s;tance between the Pri&s;ons and the Graves of Prin|ces.</HI> And this Example made a great Officer under&s;tand how King <HI>Charles</HI> the Glorious Mar|tyr was put to Death. For he, I think it was the Great Vizier, falling into Di&s;cour&s;e with the Chief Engli&s;h Interpreter at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> not then calling to mind the Fate of Sultan <HI>Ibrahim,</HI> demanded, How, and when King <HI>Charles</HI> was put to Death? Sure, &s;aid he, Your King mu&s;t have no Power, or your People mu&s;t be more Rebel|lious and Mutinous than other Nations of the World, who dur&s;t commit an Act &s;o horrid and vile as this. See, &s;aid he, How our Emperor is revered and ob&s;erved; and how &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and obedient half the World is to the Nod of our Great Monarch. To which the Interpreter re|plyed, that to recount unto him the Hi&s;tory and Occa&s;ion of this prodigious fact, would be too long and tedious for him to hear: but that the time it happened, was &s;ome Months after the Death or Murder of Sultan <HI>Ibrahim;</HI> which was an <HI>Item</HI> &s;ufficient to give him a perfect under|&s;tanding of what he required.</P>
<P>Sultan <HI>Ibrahim</HI> having in this manner ended his Days, the Government was committed into the hands of the Grand Vizier, and the old Queen-Mother (which is &s;he whom we call <HI>Kio|&s;em</HI> in the Ottoman State) and of twelve Pa|&s;haws; who were to manage all Affairs with &s;u|pream Power, during the Minority of Sultan <HI>Mahomet,</HI> who now Reigns.</P>
<P><HI>Ibrahim</HI> was the fifth Son of Sultan <HI>Achmet,</HI> born of the &s;ame Mother with Sultan <HI>Morat,</HI> Educated like the other younger Sons of the Otto|man Family; within the Walls of an ob&s;cure and unhappy Pri&s;on; &s;o that 'tis no wonder, if wanting the advantages of &s;eeing and practi|&s;ing in the World, he &s;hould neither have &s;tu|died Men, nor been experienced in the Art of Government. Nor le&s;s &s;trange is it, being na|tural to humane Infirmity; for Men who have lived under Re&s;traint, Affliction, and fear of Death, to become licentious and immoderate in all kind of Plea&s;ures, when&s;oever they pa&s;s on a &s;udden from the depth of Mi&s;ery to &s;ome tran&s;cendent degree of Happine&s;s and Pro&s;peri|ty; which as, I &s;ay, all Men are naturally &s;ub|ject unto, &s;o more e&s;pecially tho&s;e who&s;e Religion indulges them all kind of &s;en&s;ual Carnality in this Life.</P>
<P><HI>Ibrahim</HI> was in his own Nature of a gentle and ea&s;y Temper, of a large Forehead, of a quick and lively Eye and ruddy Complexion, and of a good Proportion in the Features of his Face, but yet had &s;omething in the Air of his Coun|tenance, that promi&s;ed no great Abilities of Mind. And giving him&s;elf up to all kind of Effeminacy and Softne&s;s, attended not unto the Government of his Affairs; and therefore it was his greate&s;t misfortune to be &s;erved by wicked and faithle&s;s Officers to whom he tru&s;ted, and to whom he gave Credence, wanting in him|&s;elf the Talents of Wi&s;dom and Di&s;cretion to di&s;cern their Malice.</P>
<P>The continual apprehen&s;ions that he enter|tained of Death during his Impri&s;onment, had &s;o frozen his Con&s;titution with a &s;trange frigi|dity towards Women, that all the dalliance and warm Embraces of the mo&s;t inflaming Ladies in the Seraglio, could not in a whole Years time thaw his Coldne&s;s; which was the occa|&s;ion at fir&s;t of that Report, which &s;poke him to be impotent towards Women: during which time he attended to his Mini&s;ters of Ju&s;tice, and to a management of the Affairs of his Empire, which in the beginning of his Reign gained him a Credit and Reputation, and rai&s;ed a great ex|pectation of his goodne&s;s and Care of his Sub|jects Welfare; and evidence of which, he gave in his Charge to the Great Vizier, that he &s;hould put no Man to Death unle&s;s for Capital and Enormous Crimes. But at length lo&s;ing him|&s;elf in Lu&s;ts and Sen&s;ualities, he for&s;ook the Helm of his Regency, committing the guidance of his Empire to other Hands: and as he was ignorant of War, &s;o he fooli&s;hly &s;ported in the Calms of peace; and &s;uffering him&s;elf to be guided only by Fortune, felt the Stroke thereof in his la&s;t Unhappy Fate.</P>

<HEAD>THE REIGN OF Sultan MEHMET, OR MAHOMET IV. THIRTEENTH EMPEROR OF THE TURKS.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1649" TYPE="year">
<HEAD>ANNO <HI>1649.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SUltan <HI>Ibrahim</HI> peri&s;hing in this manner, by the mutinous Violence of the Soul|diery, his Son <HI>Mehmet,</HI> or <HI>Mahomet,</HI> be|ing a Child of &s;even Years of Age, &s;uc|ceeded in the Throne: During who&s;e Minori|ty, (which was to continue for the &s;pace of ten Years longer) his Mother, who was the fir&s;t <HI>Sultana,</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted with the Coun&s;el of twelve Pa&s;haws, took upon her &s;elf the Regency, and in the fir&s;t place re&s;olved to continue the War again&s;t the Venetians, which <HI>Ibrahim</HI> intended to conclude, having engaged him&s;elf far in a Treaty of Peace with the Bailo or Amba&s;&s;ador, which re&s;ided at the Port for that Republick.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e Matters were tran&s;acting, and Preparations making to pro&s;ecute the War; the Malignant Humours of the Empire began to fer|ment unto that degree, as affected the Body Politick at fir&s;t with unnatural Heats, which &s;oon afterwards proceeded to a Feaver, and then to a dangerous Convul&s;ion. The ill-af|fected Part was the Militia, which is the Heart and Principal of the Life of that Government. For the Spahees and the Jani&s;aries, being the Hor&s;e and Foot, entred into a de&s;perater Con|trover&s;ie.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t judged it their Duty to revenge the Death of their Soveraign, Sultan <HI>Ibrahim;</HI> and in order thereunto demanded the Head of the Great Vizier, as the Chief Author and Con|triver of the Death of his Lord and Ma&s;ter. The others being con&s;cious to them&s;elves of ha|ving, by their Arms, carried on the Con&s;pira|cy, not only declared their Re&s;olutions to de|fend the Vizier, but owned that what he had acted was by their Order, and at their Reque&s;t and In&s;tigation.</P>
<P>The Spahees being highly provoked with this Declaration, &s;welled with Anger and Malice again&s;t the Jani&s;aries; and both &s;ides being equally proud and rich, could not bear each others Reproaches. The Spahees being Men of E&s;tates in Land, looked on them&s;elves as the Gentry, and to have the greate&s;t Share in the concernment of the Empire. The Jani&s;aries living regularly in their Chambers, or Martial Colledges, looked on them&s;elves as the better Souldiers, and the more formidable Party; and the truth is, both of them were proceeded to that height of Command and Authority in Go|vernment, that had they not been &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by the cruel Hand, and bloody Di&s;po&s;ition of <HI>Ku|perlee,</HI> as &s;hall be more largely related hereafter, this Empire was then in danger of falling into as many Divi&s;ions, as there were at that time Pa&s;haws, or great Captains. The cau&s;e here|of
<PB N="82" REF="44">proceeded from the warlike di&s;po&s;ition of Sultan <HI>Morat,</HI> who being the mo&s;t Martial Man of his Age, preferred none but Men of great Courage, and &s;uch as had &s;ignalized their Va|lour by undoubted proofs; And &s;uch Men as the&s;e he loaded with Honour, and rai&s;ed them to the highe&s;t and mo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">minent Charges in the Government.</P>
<P>But <HI>Morat</HI> dying &s;oon afterwards, the&s;e Great Men had time to enrich them&s;elves during the gentle and ea&s;ie Reign of Sultan <HI>Ibrahim;</HI> which being &s;econded by the Minority of this Young Sultan, their Pride knew no bounds, either of Mode&s;ty towards their Commanders, or Reve|rence towards their Sultan. Hence it was that the Souldiery dividing, &s;o great a Sedition aro&s;e among&s;t them, that at la&s;t they came to Blows, re&s;olving to decide the Controver&s;y by the Sword. But the Quarrels of Turks among&s;t them&s;elves not being Commonly of long du|rance, the Care and Vigilance of the Magi&s;trates prevented all open defiance in the Field; but yet could not &s;o paci&s;ie their Animo&s;ities, but that &s;everal Skirmi&s;hes, or Rencounters, pa&s;&s;ed be|tween them in the Streets, wherein the Spa|hees were always wor&s;ted, and at length were forced to abandon the City, &s;carce daring for &s;ome time to own the Name of Spahee within the Walls of <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Di&s;turbances gave the Venetians &s;ome hopes to accommodate their Peace with better Advantage; but the Reply to this Propo&s;ition was more fierce and po&s;itive than ever, and &s;o ill re&s;ented that the Bailo going from his Au|dience, was on the <HI>27th</HI> of <HI>April</HI> &s;eized on, and with all his Retinue. clapped into Pri&s;on and Chains; being &s;ent to tho&s;e Ca&s;tles which are &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ituate on the <HI>Bo&s;phorus,</HI> in the middle way between <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> and the Black Sea. But this furious &s;everity, by the interce&s;&s;ion of other Chri&s;tian Mini&s;ters, continued not long, before the Bailo received more gentle Treat|ment, by the Sacrifice which the Turks made unto them&s;elves of <HI>Grillo,</HI> his Interpeter, who being called down from the pre&s;ence of the Bailo, was immediately, by two Officers, &s;trangled, and his Body thrown out at the Window of the Ca&s;tle; the which act, though it may &s;eem unju&s;t and barbarous to us, hath yet been frequently practi&s;ed among&s;t the Turks, being to this day their common u&s;e to threaten the Druggermen, or Interpreters; which is the cau&s;e that they often mince, or wholly alter the &s;en&s;e or meaning of their Ma&s;ters, on tho&s;e Occa&s;ions, when words are &s;poken by them un|grateful to the Turks.</P>
<P>The Turks bearing this Di&s;dain to the Ve|netians, laboured to re-enforce their Armies in <HI>Candia,</HI> and &s;upply them with Ammunition and Provi&s;ions; and thought the Venetians lay be|fore the Mouth of the <HI>Dardanelles</HI> to intercept all Succours which might be carried thither; yet the Turks, notwith&s;tanding their Divi&s;ions, having recruited their Fleet with forty Gallies, and ten Great Ship, broke through the Vene|tians, and in de&s;pight of them, convoyed five Gallies laden with Souldiers and Ammunition, and landed them &s;afe at <HI>Canea;</HI> and about the &s;ame time &s;ix Gallies, and ten Ships of <HI>Barbary,</HI> entered into the Port of <HI>Suda.</HI></P>
<P>The General which commanded in Chief was named <HI>Chu&s;aein</HI> Pa&s;ha, a Per&s;on of great Cou|rage and Experience; he had for &s;ome time be&s;ieged the City of <HI>Candia,</HI> but for want of Men and Ammunition was forced to ri&s;e from that Place, and retire to <HI>Canea</HI> and <HI>Retimo,</HI> whil&s;t in the mean time the <HI>Candiots</HI> received re|cruits of Men, and &s;upply of Provi&s;ions, impro|ving their lei&s;ure-time to fortifie their Town with &s;uch Works as rendred it almo&s;t impregna|ble, and made it become the Wonder and Di&s;|cour&s;e of the World after &s;ome Years &s;ucceed|ing.</P>
<P>Nor was the War only carried on in <HI>Candia,</HI> but al&s;o in <HI>Dalmatia, Morea, Bo&s;na,</HI> and <HI>Al|bania.</HI> For <HI>Fo&s;colo,</HI> the General of <HI>Venice,</HI> de|&s;igning to force &s;ome Corn from the Parts of <HI>Ca&s;tel-nuovo,</HI> he landed &s;ome Men there, but was &s;o ill received by the Turks, that he was forced to retreat unto his Ve&s;&s;els with great di&s;order, and no le&s;s di&s;honour. But he had better fortune in the Parts of <HI>Bo&s;na,</HI> where he repul&s;ed the Enemy to the very Gates of <HI>Sar&s;ay,</HI> the Capital City of that Province, and took upon compo&s;ition the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Ri&s;ano,</HI> which is &s;cituate between <HI>Cataro</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;tel-nuovo;</HI> but at length the Turks receiving an additional Aid of &s;ifteen or &s;ixteen thou&s;and Men, the Veneti|ans were forced to quit their new Conque&s;ts, and retire into their own Country.</P>
<P>During the time that the&s;e Affairs were in agi|tation, the young Emperor was proclaimed, and his Inauguration celebrated with the u&s;ual Ceremonies, but with Rejoicings, and hopes ex|traordinary; who being yet &s;carcely arrived to eight years of Age, many Mutinies and Trou|bles aro&s;e in divers Parts of the Empire, as in <HI>Dama&s;cus, Syria, Anatolia,</HI> and other Countries, where the Pa&s;haws refu&s;ed to pay in the cu&s;to|mary Taxes and Tribute, declaring, That they would keep the Mony in their Hands during the Minority of the Grand Signior; and that when he came to Age of Government, they would be accountable to him both for the Prin|cipal and for the Improvement.</P>
<P>The Turks in <HI>Hungary</HI> making incur&s;ions in|to the Territories of the Emperor, were over|thrown by the Count <HI>Forgatz,</HI> near <HI>Buda,</HI> where the Pa&s;ha was taken Pri&s;oner, and his Son &s;lain.</P>
<P>Nor better fortune had they in the A&s;&s;ault they made on the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Cli&s;&s;a,</HI> where ha|ving lo&s;t five thou&s;and Men, they were forced to retire with great di&s;honour.</P>
<P>The <HI>Co&s;&s;acks</HI> al&s;o in this Conjuncture grew more bold, &s;o that they covered the Black Sea with their Boats, doing great damage to the Saicks, and other Ve&s;&s;els, which traded in that Sea; and at length came up the <HI>Bo&s;phorus</HI> above <HI>Therapea,</HI> giving a great Alarm, with much Fear and Confu&s;ion to all <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI></P>
<P>Amid&s;t the&s;e Misfortunes, and inte&s;tine Trou|bles, new Di&s;orders, aro&s;e in the Ottoman-Empire; For, as commonly, all the blame of mi&s;carriages and ill &s;ucce&s;&s;es in <HI>Turkie</HI> are ca&s;t upon the Head of the Commander in chief; &s;o the Enemies of the Great Vizier took the ad|vantage in this conjuncture to reproach his ill Government, and carried the accu&s;ation &s;o far, as to depo&s;e him from his Charge and Office; in who&s;e place the Aga, or General of the Ja|ni&s;aries, &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P>The Spahees in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> being di&s;plea&s;ed with this Election, a&s;&s;embled in a Body of &s;even or eight thou&s;and, and marched towards <HI>Con|&s;tantinople,</HI> pretending to revenge the Death of Sultan <HI>Ibrahim;</HI> their Numbers daily encrea|&s;ing, the Divan very much feared le&s;t the Party which favoured the Spahees in <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> &s;hould join them&s;elves to the A&s;ian Mutineers; to prevent which it was judged good Rea&s;on and Policy, to anticipate the Ju&s;tice they de|manded,
<PB N="83" REF="44">by taking away the Life of the depo|&s;ed Vizier; which being ea&s;ily a&s;&s;ented unto, and without much he&s;itation performed, gave &s;ome little &s;top to the Fury and Heats of the Spahees.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all which, as the Divi&s;ions which the Turks entertain among&s;t them&s;elves, were never &s;o great as to afford the Chri&s;tians any Advantage thereby, &s;o the Venetians did not reap any Benefit from the&s;e Quarrels; but on the contrary, the Turks &s;tudiou&s;ly attended to their Affairs in <HI>Candia,</HI> pa&s;&s;ing thither with &s;ixty Gallies, thirty great Ships, and twenty five other &s;maller Ve&s;&s;els, laden with Men, and all &s;orts of Provi&s;ions and Ammunition for War; &s;o that in this Year 1649, the Affairs of the Turks remained in that I&s;land in this happy and hopeful po&s;ture. Among&s;t the&s;e Ships were thirteen Engli&s;h, which the Turks took up at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> and forced into their Service. For though the Amba&s;&s;ador, Sir <HI>Thomds Bendysh,</HI> then Re&s;ident at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> oppo&s;ed the En|gagement of the&s;e Ships what was po&s;&s;ible, and al&s;o the Commanders and Seamen were very un|willing and di&s;&s;atisfied to undertake the De&s;ign, yet the Turks with Menaces, and Promi&s;es of Reward, forced them to carry Men and Ammu|nition to <HI>Candia;</HI> &s;o that, making a Virtue of Nece&s;&s;ity, they complied with that which they could not re&s;i&s;t.</P>

<P>Count <HI>Coloredo,</HI> Governour of that Place, was then &s;ick, the Gari&s;on very weak, and things reduced to the la&s;t terms of extremity; when General <HI>Balbiani,</HI> Admiral of <HI>Malta,</HI> ar|rived with &s;ix Gallies, and there landed &s;ix hun|dred Men, and &s;ixty Kingts; which with great Courage mounted the Guard of the Fort <HI>Mar|tinengo,</HI> which was the place of mo&s;t Danger and Honour. The Turks excited with a de&s;ire to welcome the new Gue&s;ts, made three de&s;pe|rate and furious A&s;&s;aults on this Fort, but were with equal Valour repul&s;ed by the Defendants; at which Di&s;grace and Foil being highly enra|ged, they re&s;olved on a fourth Attempt, which they pur&s;ued with that Courage and Succe&s;s, that the Venetians were forced to give way to their Violence, with the &s;laughter almo&s;t of all tho&s;e which defended this Fort; until the Ca|valiers of <HI>Malta,</HI> who having no greater Glory, nor readier Will, that to &s;pill their Blood for the Chri&s;tian Cau&s;e, rallied all the Force they were able, and made &s;o pro&s;perous an At|taque upon the Fort, that they recovered it a|gain, with the Blood and De&s;truction of all tho&s;e who defended it; but they enjoyed it not long, before the Turks regained it with the like &s;ucce&s;s and &s;laughter: which variety of Fortune the Venetians being &s;en&s;ible of, and that they could not bear &s;uch co&s;tly Interchanges with the Turks, had recour&s;e to their ultimate Remedy of Mines, which &s;ucceeded &s;o happily, that the whole Fort was carried into the Air, and therewith two thou&s;and good Souldiers of the Turks; with which De&s;truction, and other Repul&s;es in divers places, they were &s;o weak|ned and di&s;couraged, that they rai&s;ed the Siege on the fifth of <HI>October</HI> new Stile.</P>
<P>In this Interim, the Tartar <HI>Han,</HI> called the <HI>Krim,</HI> demanded the Guardian&s;hip of the young Sultan, as of right belonging unto him; but the Council an&s;wered hereunto, That their Ma&s;ter was already in better Hands than tho&s;e into which they de&s;ired to transfer him; and that his Grandmother, and the Divan, wanted nei|ther Wi&s;dom nor Fidelity to direct his Affairs: with which an&s;wer the Tartar being forced to remain &s;atisfied, was able to revenge him&s;elf no farther, than by exciting the Co&s;&s;acks to in|fe&s;t the Seas; which gave &s;ome diver&s;ion to tho&s;e Arms, which otherwi&s;e had all been em|ployed again&s;t the Venetians.</P>
<P>But the&s;e De&s;igns from <HI>Tartary</HI> did little trou|ble the Council, in compari&s;on of that Spirit of Di&s;cord which was ari&s;en between the Spahees and the Jani&s;aries; for both Parties being emu|lous of each others Greatne&s;s, endeavured on all Occa&s;ions to elevate their Chief Comman|ders to the highe&s;t and mo&s;t profitable Places of the Epire: which Di&s;&s;ention touching the principal Mini&s;ters of State, who were all en|gaged on the one &s;ide or the other, admini&s;tred great Troubles, and retarded the execution and &s;ucce&s;s of all the grand De&s;igns of the Empire. Nor was it of le&s;s importance and di&s;honour to the Divan, that their Fleet was hindred pa&s;&s;age by the Venetians, who blocked up the Mouth of the <HI>Dardanelles;</HI> whereby all intercour&s;e with <HI>Candia</HI> was interrupted: but being re&s;olved to remove this Ob&s;tacle, they commanded the Cap|tain-Pa&s;ha to force his Pa&s;&s;age; which he accord|ingly performing, was &s;o warmly received, that he quickly lo&s;t two Gallies, and after much Blood, and lo&s;s on both &s;ides, was forced at length to retire again within the Streights. But what was of wor&s;e con&s;equence to the Turks, was the inveterate Di&s;cord between the Spahees, and Jani&s;aries; who having been unadvi&s;edly embarked promi&s;cuou&s;ly together, came often|times to Words, and then to Blows; which ended not without the Bolld and Death of di|vers of each party. The&s;e mi&s;chiefs increa&s;ed the rage which the Turks at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> con|ceived again&s;t the Venetians; who were all thereupon (not excepting the Bailo <HI>Soranzo,</HI> nor his Secretary <HI>Ballarino</HI>) interdicted the Territories of the Grand Signior; and &s;ent back into their own Country.</P>
<P>The Captain-Pa&s;ha, that he might be in a capacity to make a &s;econd Attempt to force his pa&s;&s;age, &s;ent to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> for new Recruits: when News came that the Siege of <HI>Candia</HI> was rai&s;ed, and that the Turks had lo&s;t the Fort of St. <HI>Theodoro;</HI> which &s;o angred the Spi|rit of the Queen-mother again&s;t the Vizier, that &s;he immediately depo&s;ed him from his Charge, and therewith had taken away his Life, had not hte Faction of the Jani&s;aries protected him in this Extremity.</P>
<P>The Pa&s;ha of <HI>Buda</HI> was introduced into his place, a Per&s;on of a turbulent and ambitious
<PB N="84" REF="45">Spirit, who to increa&s;e his Favour with his Mi&s;|tre&s;s the Sultana, evidenced his Heat and Zeal again&s;t the Venetians, and to that end &s;ent im|mediately expre&s;s Orders to the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Bo&s;na,</HI> to inve&s;t <HI>Cli&s;&s;a</HI> with all the Power he was able; and therewith he pre&s;ented him with a Cimeter, and a Halter; the former to be his Reward in ca&s;e of good Succe&s;s, and the latter to be his Puni&s;hment in ca&s;e of Misfortune. But this furious Vizier continued not &s;o long, as to ex|perience the I&s;&s;ue of this Command; for he was in a few days laid a&s;ide, and <HI>Chu&s;aein</HI> Pa&s;ha, the General of <HI>Candia,</HI> was placed in his &s;tead; how&s;oever his Orders were to remain with the Army, by which means, much Emulation and Conte&s;t was prevented, which might otherwi&s;e have happened between the Spahees, and Jani|&s;aries, at the Election of a new Vizier; and thereby all excu&s;es taken from the Souldiery of ab&s;ence from the War, who could now pretend nothing of Rea&s;on to withdraw them&s;elves, on &s;core of attendance on the Vizier's Per&s;on; and to &s;upply his Authority at the Regal Court, a Chimacam was &s;ub&s;tituted to admini&s;ter Ju&s;tice in place of the Vizier, which is u&s;ual on &s;uch Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all which, Affairs &s;ucceeded not extraordinary well for the Turks in <HI>Candia;</HI> for being &s;traitned for Provi&s;ions in <HI>Canea,</HI> by the near approach of the Chri&s;tians, the Turks were forced to make a Diver&s;ion, by appear|ing in great Troops before <HI>Candia;</HI> which they were enabled to do, by the Supplies they had lately received, with the arrival of their Fleet of Gallies; for the Winter Sea&s;on approach|ing, the Venetians were con&s;trained to abandon their &s;tation before the <HI>Dardanelles,</HI> and to leave the Pa&s;&s;age open for the Enemy. And &s;o this Year ended, rather with Advantage than Di&s;|grace to the Chri&s;tians.</P>

<P>WIth the&s;e great Succours and Supplies &s;ent to <HI>Candia</HI> by the Turks, Affairs mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have &s;ucceeded pro&s;perou&s;ly to their De&s;igns, had not inte&s;tine Di&s;cords at Home interrupted their proceedings; which aro&s;e from a Jealou&s;y and Emulation between the Grand|mother and Mother of the young Sultan. For each of them pretending to the tuition or guar|dian&s;hip of the Emperor, during his Minority, divers Parties and Factions formed at <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople,</HI> from whence all that Trouble and Com|bu&s;tion aro&s;e, which we have at large related in the third Chapter of the Pre&s;ent State of the Ottoman Empire.</P>
<P>So that now it was no time to talk to the Souldiers or People of a War in <HI>Candia;</HI> For the fir&s;t thought them&s;elves engaged to contrive a Settlement and Determination of Di&s;putes at Home: and the latter being irritated with a new Tax laid on them, for want of Mony in the Trea&s;ury, exclaimed, and talked loud, and at length, in&s;tead of paying, broke out into open Rebellion; which by a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Soul|diery, was appea&s;ed, under no le&s;s Terms than the Death of &s;everal principal Mini&s;ters of State.</P>
<P>During the&s;e Divi&s;ions, the Venetians had time to arm out a very con&s;iderable Fleet for defence of <HI>Candia; Fo&s;colo,</HI> who had been Ge|neral in <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> being &s;ent thither with title of <HI>Generali&s;&s;imo</HI> in the place of <HI>Mocenigo:</HI> But the&s;e Di&s;&s;entions among&s;t the Turks, according to their u&s;ual Cu&s;tom, la&s;ting not long before they came to a Conclu&s;ion, by the entire de|&s;truction of one of the Parties; the Chief Mi|ni&s;ters began to rea&s;&s;ume again the thoughts of pro&s;ecuting the War in <HI>Candia,</HI> and to &s;end Recruits to reinforce the Army under the Com|mand of <HI>Chu&s;aein</HI> Pa&s;ha, who was returned with new Forces and Courage to a&s;&s;ault the City of <HI>Candia.</HI></P>
<P>At this time a certain Greek, pretending to be a Per&s;on of Quality, and di&s;contented with the Turks, fled from them to the Chri&s;tians, where being received with all kind and obliging entertainment, he had thereby liberty of &s;eeing and vi&s;iting all the Fortifications of the Place. After he had ob&s;erved and di&s;covered as much as he de&s;ired, this traiterous Fugitive fled again to the Turki&s;h Camp, where he revealed what places were mo&s;t &s;trong or be&s;t fortified, and where the Town was weake&s;t, and mo&s;t ea&s;ily to be a&s;&s;aulted. The Venetian General being awakened at this Di&s;covery, and con&s;idering the numbers of his People to be few, in re&s;pect of the Enemy, and that the Outworks could not be maintained without a more numerous Gari|&s;on, he re&s;olved to de&s;troy &s;ome of tho&s;e Forts; and accordingly blew up with Mines four Ba&s;ti|ons, which being at a di&s;tance could not be re|lieved without much danger. The Turks here|by making conjectures of the weakne&s;s of the be&s;ieged, cheerfully a&s;&s;aulted the Fort of St. <HI>De|metrio,</HI> thinking to carry it without much trou|ble; but contrary to their expectation, they en|countred &s;o bold a re&s;i&s;tance, that they lo&s;t three thou&s;and Men on the Place.</P>
<P>At <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> they were &s;till &s;o intent to carry on this War, that having prepared, and laden on the Fleet great quantities of Grana|does, Bomboes, and Mortar-pieces, with other Fire-works, the Captain-Pa&s;ha, with hopes a|greeable to his Force, &s;et forth to Sea, with eleven hundred Sail, con&s;i&s;ting of Gallies, Ships, Gallea&s;&s;es, Saiques, Brigantines, and &s;maller Ve&s;&s;els, with re&s;olution to engage the Venetian Fleet, who&s;e Commanders al&s;o were equally de|&s;irous and ready to con&s;ent with them to a Bat|tel.</P>
<P>On the <HI>7th</HI> of <HI>July,</HI> the Venetians being at an Anchor in the Port of St. <HI>Ermina,</HI> di&s;covered the Turki&s;h Fleet, to which, as they were much inferiour in number, &s;o they were &s;uperiour to them in the agreement and experience of their Commanders. The Turks having pa&s;&s;ed for|ward on their way, the Venetians pur&s;ued them, and the better to draw them to a Battel, <HI>Moce|nigo</HI> ordered two Ships, commanded by <HI>Barbaro</HI> and <HI>Dolphino</HI> to cro&s;s the Turks at the point of the I&s;land; and his Vice-Admiral, <HI>Bataggio,</HI> with four Ships to engage the main Body of the the Turki&s;h Fleet; to who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance many other Ve&s;&s;els coming in, he &s;o rudely treated &s;everal Gallies, that they were forced to &s;eek harbour in the Port of <HI>Chios,</HI> now <HI>Scio,</HI> with the lo&s;s of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> Pa&s;ha of <HI>Anatolia,</HI> who was &s;ent to &s;ucceed in the Office of <HI>Chu&s;aein</HI> Pa&s;ha, the General of <HI>Candia;</HI> but Night coming on, the re&s;t of the Fleet retreated to the I&s;les of <HI>Naxia</HI> and <HI>Paros.</HI></P>
<P>On the tenth day the Turks having watered their Fleet, gave a &s;ignal of defiance to the Ve|netians, by di&s;charge of two pieces of Cannon; and the Venetians accepting the Challenge, both Fleets gave a furious charge one to the other; but the Turks were not able to with&s;tand the Courage and Skilfulne&s;s of the Venetians; for the Captain-Pa&s;ha having lo&s;t many of his Men, and the Poop of his Gally being carried
<PB N="85" REF="45">away with a Cannon-&s;hot, the whole Fleet was put into Di&s;order, and then unto flight, &s;o that the Gallies began to employ them&s;elves in toaing the Ships. But one of their Mahones being &s;e|parated from the re&s;t, was a&s;&s;aulted by two Gal|lea&s;&s;es, and &s;ome Ships, and finding none to come in for Succour, the Captain was killed, with four hundred Souldiers, and two hundred were taken Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>In the mean time <HI>Mocenigo,</HI> the General, gave cha&s;e to the Gallies, which two to a Ship were toaing the heavier Ve&s;&s;els as fa&s;t as they could; but being hardly pur&s;ued, were forced to ca&s;t off the Hau&s;er, and &s;hift for them&s;elves as well as they were able.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A great Vi|ctory ob|tained by the Veneti|ans over the Turks.</NOTE> The Turki&s;h Ships &s;eeing them&s;elves thus abandoned, fired whole Broad|&s;ides upon the Enemy; but the Venetian Gallies leaving their own Ships a&s;tern, that they might pur&s;ue their advantage, <HI>Querini</HI> boarded a Great Gallea&s;s, called the <HI>Soltana,</HI> upon which were three hundred Souldiers, who offered to &s;urren|der upon promi&s;e of Quarter for their Lives. But the Chri&s;tian Souldiers heated with fight, and not then under&s;tanding any thing of Con|ditions, de&s;perately boarded the Ve&s;&s;el, where|by the Turks being reduced to an extremity of de&s;pair, gave fire to the Powder, and therewith carried, as well the Vanqui&s;hers, as the Van|qui&s;hed, into the other World.</P>
<P>According to this example four other Ve&s;&s;els burnt them&s;elves, one of 60 bra&s;s Guns, and three others of 40 to 44. Fifteen Ve&s;&s;els of the Starboard Wing &s;aved them&s;elves by good &s;ail|ing. Of the Larboard Wing, Captain <HI>Nicolo,</HI> a Renegado, with his Ship, was taken by the Admiral of the Gallea&s;&s;es, likewi&s;e another Great Ve&s;&s;el by <HI>Lazaro Mocenigo,</HI> and another by Proveditor <HI>Melino.</HI> In &s;hort, there was not one Ve&s;&s;el which remained in &s;ight of the Vene|tians, which was not either taken, &s;unk, or burnt. Notwith&s;tanding all which, con&s;idering the Ve&s;&s;els which were e&s;caped, and the 3 thou|&s;and Men which the Turks had landed at <HI>Naxia,</HI> in order to their being tran&s;ported unto <HI>Candia,</HI> the Victory &s;eemed to be very imperfect; wherefore the Venetians attending another en|counter with the Turki&s;h Fleet, did happily meet them in a few days after; and being en|couraged with the late Succe&s;s, as the Enemy was low in their Spirits and Re&s;olution, they bravely attaqued the Turks, and took 39 Gal|lies, 23 Ships, three Gallea&s;&s;es, together with the three thou&s;and Souldiers which were then embarked from <HI>Naxia:</HI> Tho&s;e which e&s;caped took Refuge in the Port of <HI>Rhodes.</HI></P>
<P>After this great lo&s;s, the Turks entertained no great De&s;igns of the Conque&s;t of <HI>Candia;</HI> but only to con&s;erve <HI>Canea,</HI> and the footing that they had won in that I&s;land: nor did ever the Turks after this, dare to &s;tand a formal Battel with the Venetians at Sea, but rather contriving to e&s;cape than to fight, did ever af|ter build light Gallies, for tran&s;porting of Men and Ammunition, with intention to wage their War only at Land, and not at Sea; it being a &s;aying ever after common in their Mouths; <HI>That God had given the Sea to Chri&s;tians, and the Earth to the Turks.</HI></P>
<P>To the&s;e ill Succe&s;&s;es abroad, were added great Di&s;&s;entions at Home; for the mutinous Spahees in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> having united into a &s;trong Body, marched towards <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> to join with their other Brethren in tho&s;e Parts. The Jani&s;aries on the other &s;ide, not le&s;s diligent to oppo&s;e their Enemy, to revenge the Outrages committed on their Brethren, whom the Spa|hees had ill-treated, having cut off the No&s;es and Ears of &s;everal of them; be&s;ides all which, they proceeded to that height of In&s;olence, as to demand the Heads of the Great Vizier, and of the Aga of the Jani&s;aries; and being now by their numbers rendered formidable to the Court, it was judged agreeable to the pre&s;ent Con|juncture, to &s;atisfy in &s;ome mea&s;ure the&s;e Muti|niers, by di&s;charging the&s;e two Officers of their employment, which did in &s;ome degree for the pre&s;ent quallfy and appea&s;e the&s;e Tumults.</P>

<P>BUT the&s;e Troubles being with time com|po&s;ed, the Grand Vizier de&s;ired greatly the Conque&s;t of <HI>Candia,</HI> which being by experience proved to be with difficulty guined by the Sword, he endeavoured to win it by fairer Terms; and to that end wrote a Letter to the Republick of <HI>Venice,</HI> in Letters of Gold; wherein he decla|red, that it &s;eemed &s;trange to him, that the Se|nate had not di&s;patched their Amba&s;&s;ador to him with the &s;urrender of <HI>Candia,</HI> in regard that thereby they might a&s;&s;ure them&s;elves to purcha&s;e a certain Peace, which they vainly re|tarded by &s;uch delays.

<P>The Venetian Fleet being Victorious at Sea, made it their work to keep the Mouth of the <HI>Dardanelles</HI> always blocked up, whereby they hindered all Succours from <HI>Candia:</HI> notwith|&s;tanding which diligence, the Venetians being &s;ometimes forced, for the &s;ake of Water and Provi&s;ion, to abandon that Station; the Turks took hold of the opportunity to e&s;cape forth; but being eagerly pur&s;ued by the Venetians, they were forced to take Sanctuary in <HI>Rhodes,</HI> where being again blocked up, the affairs in <HI>Candia</HI> &s;uffered much, and the Complaints from thence were loud at the Court.

<P>THE Venetians judged that the&s;e Troubles would naturally produce &s;ome Advantage to them, and much facilitate the Peace which they had long de&s;ired: but as Seditions among&s;t the Turks are always too violent to continue; &s;o the&s;e Di&s;contents evaporated in a &s;hort time, and new Re&s;olutions were taken to pro&s;ecute the War in <HI>Candia;</HI> for notwith&s;tanding that <HI>Mon|&s;ieur de Ventelay,</HI> Son to the French Amba&s;&s;ador, mediated with agreeable prudence to compo&s;e Matters in order to a Peace, yet his Endea|vours were all in&s;ignificant; for neither had Sig|nior <HI>Capello</HI> Audience granted him, nor that li|berty which was promi&s;ed before his Arrival; the Turks &s;till in&s;i&s;ting on the Surrender of <HI>Candia,</HI> would not under&s;tand any Terms which did not entirely inve&s;t them in that Conque&s;t.</P>
<P>To effect which by Force, which could not be performed by Compo&s;ition; the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Buda</HI> was Elected for Captain-Pa&s;ha, or Commander in Chief of the Seas; and Orders given to equippe a new Fleet of Ships, and Gallies, for tran&s;porting the Succours of Men and Provi|&s;ions to <HI>Candia:</HI> where <HI>Chu&s;aein</HI> Pa&s;ha the Ge|neral, being wearied with his long Siege of the Town, withdrew his Men at &s;ome farther di|&s;tance for their better refre&s;hment; for they wanting all Conveniencies in their Trenches, began to Mutiny, and to refu&s;e the perfor|mance of their Duty, until the General &s;atisfy|ing their Pay, and di&s;pen&s;ing liberally Large&s;|&s;es to the Officers, gave them new Encourage|ment and Satisfaction; with which, being a little enlivened, <HI>Chu&s;aein</HI> &s;ent a Herald, with a defiance to tho&s;e in the City, challenging them to fight a pitcht Battel with him: but the Chri|&s;tians refu&s;ed the Offer, thinking it more pru|dence not to accept, than lo&s;s of Honour to de|ny an An&s;wer to the Challenge. Then the Turks &s;ought &s;ome means to effect their De&s;ign by Treachery; to which end, they treated with a certain Captain for delivery of one of the Gates of the City; which he promi&s;ed to do unto the Turks, but gave Adverti&s;ement unto the Governour. The Pa&s;ha the night following advanced with &s;ome Troops, hoping to find one of the Gates opened to him; but in&s;tead there|of, the Defendants having prepared a Mine to receive them, &s;prang the &s;ame &s;o opportunely, that it carried away the mo&s;t of tho&s;e who were engaged in the De&s;ign, and therewith their hopes of becoming Ma&s;ters &s;peedily of that im|pregnable Fortre&s;s. Wherefore they re&s;olved for a while to repo&s;e, and attend tho&s;e Suc|cours which were now preparing at <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople.</HI></P>
<P>The Fleet being put into a readine&s;s, the Souldiery departed with their u&s;ual hopes of Succe&s;s; but meeting with their Enemy again at the Mouth of the <HI>Dardanelli,</HI> the Fight was fu|rious and hot for a long time between them, but concluded to the di&s;advantage of the Turks, who there lo&s;t 6000 Men, two Gallies, three Ships, and a Mahone: how&s;oever they broke through the Venetians, and landed 12000 Men in the I&s;le of <HI>Candia.</HI> The News of this defeat, and the Confirmation thereof, by the wounded Men which were landed at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> made a great noi&s;e among&s;t the people. How&s;oever the Turks per&s;i&s;ting con&s;tant to their Intentions of pro&s;ecuting the War, &s;ent Orders to the Captain-Pa&s;ha again to fight the Venetians &s;o &s;oon as the Fleet was refitted, and re&s;tored to a condition to engage in another Battel; but the Venetians &s;carce gave them the lei&s;ure to repair, before they attacked them again, whereby they put them to &s;uch di&s;order, that they were forced to take refuge in the fir&s;t convenient Port; where having attended a favourable Wind, they ha&s;tned to <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> and from thence were di&s;patched into the Black Sea again&s;t the Co&s;|&s;acks, who very much infe&s;ted tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P>The Captain-Pa&s;ha being arrived, extolled his own great Services and Adventures, and on the contrary vilified the Great Vizier, di&s;para|ging all his Actions, as mixed with weak Coun|&s;els, and pro&s;ecuted with Cowardi&s;e, or want of true Re&s;olution: the which took &s;uch deep impre&s;&s;ion in his ab&s;ence, having none to an|&s;wer for him; that all being given for granted which was alledged again&s;t him, Orders were di&s;patched to <HI>Candia</HI> by an Officer to take off his Head, in who&s;e place this Captain-Pa&s;ha &s;uc|ceeded.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t of all the&s;e Combu&s;tions of War, the mediation of Peace was carried on by the French Amba&s;&s;ador: For though Signior <HI>Capello</HI> was actually Re&s;ident on the Place, qualified with the Character of Bailo for the Republick of <HI>Venice;</HI> yet the Turks would &s;carce vouch|&s;afe to Treat per&s;onally with him; and indeed his &s;ufferings by Impri&s;onment, and other bar|barous U&s;ages, had affected him with &s;uch a me|lancholy, as rendred him uncapable for &s;ome time of admini&s;tring publick Affairs; for ha|ving lo&s;t his Rea&s;on, by giving way to &s;ad and black Thoughts, he laid violent Hands on
<PB N="87" REF="46">him&s;elf, by wounding him&s;elf in two or three places of his Belly; but the Wounds proving not Mortal, he was in a &s;hort time re&s;tored again to a &s;ound E&s;tate both in Mind and Body; as I &s;hall &s;ome few years after have occa&s;ion to re|late from the words of his own Mouth, which he was plea&s;ed to utter to me on his Death-bed, the day before he departed this Life.</P>

<P>THE Great Vizier after all his evil In&s;inuati|ons again&s;t <HI>Chu&s;aein</HI> Pa&s;ha, fell very &s;ick and infirm; &s;o that the Court con&s;idering him as a Per&s;on uncapable of farther Service, ca&s;t their eyes on the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Aleppo,</HI> who being a daring Martial Man, was e&s;teemed to be the better Chief in &s;uch a hazardous War, which for be|ing on the Sea, was unu&s;ual and di&s;plea&s;ing to the Turks. Again&s;t him nothing could be objected be&s;ides his Rebellions and Contrariety to the Government; but hereunto it was pre|&s;ently an&s;wered, that the extravagance of his humour proceeded only from his Ambition of being Great Vizier; which when he had attain|ed, that thir&s;ty de&s;ire of Glory, which he exer|cis'd for acquiring this Office, would be bu&s;ied in thoughts to advance and improve his Honour in Actions beyond his Predece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>Letters being arrived at this Pa&s;ha's hands, which called him to Court to accept this Charge, did &s;ecretly plea&s;e the humour of his haughty Spirit; how&s;oever, he remained for a while in &s;ome &s;u&s;pence and irre&s;olution, not being a&s;&s;ured whether &s;ome Deceit might not be concealed under this &s;pecious appearance of Preferment: But con&s;idering, that the way unto Gains and Advantage was by daring Adventures, he re&s;o|lutely accepted the Proffer, and put him&s;elf in his March towards <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> with a glori|ous Equipage of forty thou&s;and Men, thinking therewith to make good his Retreat, and &s;ecure his Per&s;on in ca&s;e that Deceit were di&s;covered which he rationally &s;u&s;pected. Being arrived near unto <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> he received from the Great Signior &s;everal Me&s;&s;ages of Kindne&s;s, and a good welcome; and was accordingly received into the City, and inve&s;ted in the Office, with all the Circum&s;tances of Favour and Honour imaginable.</P>
<P>Having thus taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Charge, he promi&s;ed the Grand Signior that he would employ all his Endeavours to re&s;tore the decayed E&s;tate of Affairs, and reform the Government. And as an earne&s;t thereof, he began to remove &s;uch Mini&s;ters from the Court which were &s;u&s;|pected by him; and to render him&s;elf the more Ab&s;olute, he cut off &s;everal others, whom he imagined might in any wi&s;e di&s;turb or controul him in the management of his Affairs.</P>
<P>After which he di&s;patched his Orders to all Maritime Towns of the Empire, to fit and make ready what Gallies and Ships were po&s;&s;ible to be provided, intending thereby to &s;et out the greate&s;t Fleet that ever was &s;een in the <HI>Levant:</HI> but to compleat this Work, two great Diffi|culties aro&s;e; The fir&s;t was, to find a wi&s;e and well experienced Commander: and the next, was in what manner to per&s;wade the Spahees and Ja|ni&s;aries to embark; for they having heard and &s;een in what manner their Companions had pe|ri&s;hed in this mi&s;erable War, ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to go; and though the Animo&s;ities of the&s;e two orders of Souldiers were irreconcileable one to the other, yet in this common Cau&s;e being uni|ted, they rai&s;ed &s;o horrible a Sedition, that they a&s;&s;aulted the Mufti in his very Hou&s;e, and pur|&s;ued him within the Gates of the Seraglio with a thou&s;and reproaches and injuries, as an Au|thor of evil Coun&s;els, and a Di&s;turber of the common Peace and Quiet of the Empire. Nor was it po&s;&s;ible to appea&s;e this Tumult, but by anticipating to them four months Pay; with which their Minds being made more pliable, they gently yielded to Obedience, and &s;uffered them|&s;elves to be embarked for <HI>Candia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Zarnozau Mu&s;tapha</HI> was made Captain-Pa&s;ha; or General of the Fleet, which was very nu|merous, and well equipped, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ixty Gallies, eight Mahones, thirty great Ship of War, and &s;ixty one Gallies belonging to the Beys. After having remained three days at the mouth of the <HI>Dardanelles</HI> near the Ca&s;tles, they went out in this Order; The Bey's Gallies were the fir&s;t, then followed the Ships, next the Ma|hones, and the Rear con&s;i&s;ted wholly of the Grand Signior's Gallies. The Van of the Fleet being the Bey's Gallies, which are always the be&s;t manned, and provided, were ordered to attack the main Body of the Chri&s;tian Fleet, for that, being &s;econded with the Ships, they would be able to &s;u&s;tain the Shock until the Ma|hones could come up, which were directed again&s;t the Starboard Wing of the Enemy, com|po&s;ed of Gallea&s;&s;es. The Venetians, though much inferior in Number, yet as great in Cou|rage, gave evident Signs of their de&s;ire to fight, with hopes, by God's Ble&s;&s;ing, to obtain a Victo|ry. The Venetians whil&s;t the Turks pa&s;&s;ed, remained &s;till with their Anchors apique, which the Turks interpreting as a token of their Cou|rage and Boldne&s;s, were &s;o daunted, that they began to ply toward the Coa&s;t of <HI>Greece;</HI> but being forced to pa&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> the Guns of the Ve|netian Admiral, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;o ill treated by his Broad&s;ides, that they were di&s;couraged from making a &s;econd Charge. The Ships, and o|ther Ve&s;&s;els fared little better being forced to pa&s;s under the Guns of the Enemies Fleet. The Captain-Pa&s;ha attempted to pa&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> Coa&s;t of <HI>Anatolia,</HI> with his lighter Gallies, but being hindred by a &s;trong party of the Enemy, he was forced to follow the re&s;t of the Fleet, taking his Cour&s;e with them by the Coa&s;t of <HI>Greece.</HI> In this Charge one of the Turks Mahones was &s;unk, and two di&s;abled: But the greate&s;t Fight happened between a Squadron of the Turks Ships, and four of the Venetians, which had been hard put to it, had not the Captain <HI>Moce|nigo</HI> come in to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance; how&s;oever, the Venetian Captain of the Ship, called the <HI>Crown,</HI> was &s;lain by a Musket &s;hot.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the Chri&s;tians boarded the Turks with &s;o much Vigour and Re&s;olution, that they took &s;everal of their Ships, and mixing with the thicke&s;t of their other Ve&s;&s;els, they put ma|ny A&s;hore, and others e&s;caping in their Boats, left their Slaves and Gallies to the di&s;po&s;al of the Enemy; &s;o that the Venetians obtained that day a hundred bra&s;s Guns, with a &s;ignal Victory, having had no other important Lo&s;s, unle&s;s the Ship called the <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Goliah,</HI> which being overpowered, was burnt by the Turks.</P>
<P>The People of the Turks, who were in daily expectation to receive intelligence of a Succe&s;s, agreeable to &s;o great Preparations, were much troubled to hear the News of the Defeat gi|ven to their Naval Forces; of which Mi&s;car|riage, the World dividing it &s;elf into different Conjectures, the mo&s;t part, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> attributed the Misfortune of all
<PB N="88" REF="47">to the ill Government, and want of Experience in the General. Wherefore to appea&s;e the Peo|ple, e&s;pecially the Merchants, who were weary of this Marine War; from whence they reap|ed nothing but Lo&s;&s;es of their Ships and Goods; It was thought fit to enter into a Treaty with Signior <HI>Capello,</HI> the Venetian Bailo, concerning a Peace; but he having his Commi&s;&s;ion taken from him, for the Rea&s;on before related, his Secretary <HI>Ballarino</HI> &s;upplyed his Office; and in Order to an Accommodation, had two Audi|ences with the Great Vizier, to whom, and to others of the Divan, he made Pre&s;ents of rich Pieces of Cloth of Gold, in the Name of the Republick. How&s;oever the Turks thinking it di&s;honourable to accord unto other Terms, than the intire Re&s;ignation of <HI>Candia,</HI> proceeded in their Preparations as formerly; at which the Merchants and Trade&s;men at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> re|ceived &s;uch matter of Di&s;contentment, that in Tumults they cryed out for Peace at the Gates of the very. Seraglio; and behaved them&s;elves with that In&s;olence, that the Jani&s;aries were called to drive them from thence by force of Arms; how&s;oever this Tumult and Riot of the People ended not without the Life of the Great Vizier, to who&s;e fury he was made a Sacrifice. And though his Son appeared at the Gates of the City with forty thou&s;and Men, to demand Ju&s;tice on the Murderers of his Father, yet the People were &s;o far from being di&s;mayed thereat, that their Fury and Rage encrea&s;ed to a great|er height, and required the Authority of the Divan to keep things from running into the In|conveniences of a Civil War.</P>

<P>THe&s;e Di&s;orders induced the chief Mini&s;ters to enter into another Treaty with <HI>Ballari|no,</HI> propo&s;ing to withdraw their Forces from <HI>Candia,</HI> and make a Peace, upon the paiment of ten Millions for the Charge of the War: And to incline the Venetians hereunto, the Turks gave &s;evere Orders to their People living about <HI>Corfou,</HI> to mole&s;t the Inhabitants of that I&s;land with all Acts of Ho&s;tility imaginable: and far|ther publi&s;hed, That their Intentions were to &s;et out a more numerous and &s;tronger Fleet, than any which from the beginning of this War had &s;ailed on the Seas; and in order therein|to, great Numbers of Slaves, con&s;i&s;ting of Co&s;&s;acks and Mo&s;covites, were bought of the Tartars, and tran&s;ported to <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI></P>
<P>The Venetians were not in the lea&s;t affrigh|ted at the&s;e Boa&s;tings of the Turk, but on the contrary, knowing that their Affairs in <HI>Candia</HI> were well &s;ecured and provided, gave Orders to <HI>Ballarino</HI> to de&s;i&s;t from farther Treaties, and to procure his Licence to depart. And the Turks, to evidence their intentions to pro&s;ecute the War, entered into <HI>Canea</HI> with twenty eight Sail, laden with Arms and Provi&s;ions, on which al&s;o were fifteen hundred Men. By this convey|ance was &s;ent a Jani&s;ar-Aga with Orders from the Grand Signior, to con&s;titute <HI>Chu&s;aein</HI> Pa&s;ha in the place of Captain-Pa&s;ha, or Admiral of the Seas; but he judging this to be a De&s;ign, or Lure, to draw him from his Po&s;t, or Office, where|in he was more &s;trong and &s;ecure, acknowledged the Honour of the Employment, but framed Excu&s;es to continue his Seat and Place of Re&s;i|dence, which the Chief Mini&s;ters were forced to accept; it being a Conjuncture more &s;ea&s;ona|ble to di&s;&s;emble, than to re&s;ent his refu&s;al.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t new Preparations were making again&s;t <HI>Candia,</HI> &s;o horrible a &s;torm of Mutiny and Se|dition aro&s;e at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> as con&s;trained the Grandees of the Council to quit for the pre|&s;ent all thoughts of providing for the War again&s;t the Enemy, that they might defend and &s;ave them&s;elves from the Fury of their own People; For the Spahees and Jani&s;aries join|ing together, pretended to reform the Abu&s;es of the State; to perform which, in a furious Tumult, putting them&s;elves in Arms, they ran to the Divan, where they depo&s;ed the Great Vizier,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Rebellion at <HI>Con|&s;tantino|ple.</HI></NOTE> and di&s;charged divers other Officers of their Employment; The Mufti was con&s;train|ed to fly to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and the Queen-Mother &s;carce remained &s;ecure in her old Seraglio. And to &s;o great a height their Rebellion proceeded, that they propo&s;ed even to dethrone the Grand Signior him&s;elf. And having thus ca&s;t off all Re&s;pect and Duty to their Prince, they entred the Imperial Palace, and forcing the Guards, broke up the Trea&s;ury, and carried two millions from thence.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t of this horrid and affrighting Confu|&s;ion, Merchants and well-meaning Citizens re|mained in the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing apprehen&s;ions imaginable; for all Laws being broken, and Ju&s;tice unregarded; the whole City laid open to be pillaged and &s;acked by the licentiou&s;nefs of an unbridled Souldiery. For &s;everal days the Offi|ces both of the Mufti, and Great Vizier re|mained vacant, by rea&s;on that the two Facti|ons of Jani&s;aries and Spahees could not agree upon the Election. At length the mo&s;t &s;editious among&s;t them wearying out the others with Quarrels and Conte&s;ts, advanced a Fellow of no Under&s;tanding or Reputation to the eminent degree of Great Vizier; in which condition he remained not long. For the Fire of the mul|titude being with time quenched, and the po|pular Heat abated, this new Vizier was di&s;pla|ced, all things returning to their u&s;ual Channel, and Authority to its Fountain.</P>
<P>And that Matters might more ea&s;ily be re|&s;tored to their ancient order, the Grand Signior called for the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Dama&s;cus</HI> to receive the Dignity of Great Vizier; for he being a Per|&s;on of eighty Years of Age, and of long Ex|perience in Affairs, having managed the mo&s;t weighty Charges of the Empire, was looked on by all as the mo&s;t proper Per&s;on to com|po&s;e and heal the&s;e great Di&s;tempers in the State; and this was that famous <HI>Kuperlee,</HI> who was Father to him who &s;ucceeded him in this Office. The Pa&s;ha of <HI>Sili&s;tria</HI> was al&s;o con&s;ti|tuted Captain Pa&s;ha, and <HI>Chu&s;aein</HI> was confir|med in his Government of <HI>Candia.</HI></P>
<P>And now the bright Beams of Ju&s;tice and Government having di&s;&s;ipated the Storms and Fury of popular Sollevations; the Grand Sig|nior in Per&s;on mounting his Hor&s;e, accompa|nied with his principal Mini&s;ters of State, vi|&s;ited all the Parts of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> where ma|king Inqui&s;ition for the principal Leaders and Fo|menters of this Rebellion, he &s;eized on &s;ome, and without further proce&s;s, boldly executed them in the Face of the People.</P>
<P>But before things were reduced to this con|dition, four Months were &s;pent in this horrid Confu&s;ion; and what is mo&s;t &s;trange, this Great Empire for &s;o long time remained without a Pilot, to&s;&s;ed on the Waves of popular Commo|tions; all which &s;erved to give ea&s;e and re&s;pite to the Venetians in their War, but not to ope|rate towards a Peace; &s;o re&s;olute were the Turks in their De&s;ign of making an entire Con|que&s;t of <HI>Candia.</HI></P>
<PB N="89" REF="47">
<P>Far having again Equipped a mo&s;t formida|ble Fleet, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ixty light Gallies, twen|ty eight Ships, and nine Gallea&s;&s;es; they attemp|ted to make their way for <HI>Candia,</HI> and there|with to fight the Venetians in ca&s;e they &s;hould oppo&s;e them in their Voyage, to which they were the more encouraged upon &s;ight of the Venetians, who appeared at the Streights of the <HI>Dardanelli,</HI> with no more than twenty nine Gallies, and &s;ome Boat, or Brigantines; how|&s;oever the Turks were not &s;o confident in their numbers, but that they judged it requi&s;ite to fortify them&s;elves with two Batteries; one on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Anatolia,</HI> and the other on the European &s;hore; whereby they imagined, that they might cau&s;e the Venetians to give way, and open a Pa&s;&s;age to their Fleet.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding the continual &s;hot which the Turks made upon them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Engage|ment be|tween the Turks and Venetians.</NOTE> they &s;till kept their Station from the <HI>23d</HI> to the <HI>26th</HI> of <HI>June;</HI> when the Wind coming about to the North, which was favourable for the Turks to Sail out, and to bring them nearer to their Enemies, they began gently to approach; and the like the Chri|&s;tians endeavoured, being de&s;irous to join Bat|tel; at which firmne&s;s of Re&s;olution, the Turks being a little &s;tartled, became willing to avoid the Fight, and to creep under the &s;helter of the point of <HI>Babiers,</HI> which locks in one of the Bayes between the Ca&s;tles and the Mouth of the <HI>Dardanelli.</HI> But the Wind on a &s;udden turn|ing favourable for the Venetians, the Prior of <HI>Rochelle</HI> with his Squadron, and <HI>Mocenigo</HI> with three Ships under his Command, made up to|wards the Ca&s;tles, with de&s;ign to cut the Turks off from their Retreat; the others valiantly a&s;&s;ailed the Turks, who defending them&s;elves like tho&s;e, who&s;e chief &s;ecurity con&s;i&s;ts in their Arms, there en&s;ued a mo&s;t mi&s;erable &s;langhter on one &s;ide,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Veneti|ans obtain the Victory.</NOTE> and the other; at length the Suc|ce&s;s of Victory happened to the Venetians, who were animated by the couragious Example of their General <HI>Marcello,</HI> though he having Boarded, and become Ma&s;ter of a great Ship called a <HI>Soltana,</HI> with the Gally which attended her, was &s;hot in the thigh with a Cannon Bul|let, and thereby gained the glory to die Con|quering, and Triumphant.</P>
<P>After who&s;e Death, the Proveditor taking upon him the Command of the Fleet, pro&s;e|cuted the Victory &s;o clo&s;e, that excepting four|teen Gallies which e&s;caped with the Captain-Pa&s;ha, and four Gallies of the Bey's; all the whole Flect was either taken, &s;unk, or burnt. The Venetians not being able to man all the Ve&s;&s;els that they had taken, &s;et many of them on fire in the Night, excepting only twelve Gal|lies, four Ships, and two Gallea&s;&s;es, which they re&s;erved for a Demon&s;tration or Evidence of their Victory. With this glorious &s;ucce&s;s five thou&s;and poor Chri&s;tians obtained their Free|dom, and had their Chains and Shackles knock|ed off. What number the Turks might have lo&s;t is uncertain; but as to the Venetians, it is re|ported, that be&s;ides their General, there were not above three hundred Men in all killed and wounded.</P>
<P>The Venetians being encouraged by this Suc|ce&s;s, attacked the I&s;land of <HI>Tenedos,</HI> and in the &s;pace of four days became Ma&s;ters of it; as al&s;o in a &s;hort time afterwards of <HI>Stalimene,</HI> an|tiently called <HI>Lemnos;</HI> the which &s;hameful Lo&s;|&s;es and Overthrow, &s;o irritated the Mind of the Grand Signior, that he gave Orders to car|ry the War into <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> intending the next Summer to go thither in Per&s;on; and in the mean time Commanded by the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Bo&s;na,</HI> that the City of <HI>Ragu&s;a</HI> &s;hould be put into a readine&s;s to receive his Troops, being judged a convenient Place for the Seat and Magazine of Arms for tho&s;e Countries.</P>
<P>But the poor Republick greatly apprehend|ing this Misfortune, than which there could be no greater Mi&s;chief, nor Ruin to their Country; di&s;patched certain Deputies with their yearly Tribute to the Port, with In&s;tructions, that in the way thither, they &s;hould &s;upplicate the Pa|&s;ha to intercede with the Grand Signior in their behalf, repre&s;enting to his Maje&s;ty, that they paying their annual Tribute for Protection, ought not in ju&s;tice to be expo&s;ed to the licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s of an Army, which their little Ter|ritories were not capable to receive, nor pro|vide with convenient Quarters: at which Me&s;|&s;age the Pa&s;ha being highly incen&s;ed, an&s;wered rudely, and impri&s;oned them; threatning to &s;trangle them, in ca&s;e their Government did not obey the Commands of the Sultan.</P>

<P>BUT the chief Mini&s;ters at the Port, taking into their con&s;ideration the pre&s;ent State of Affairs; that the City of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> was full of Di&s;contents; the Per&s;ian on one &s;ide, and the Mo&s;covite on the other, ready to invade di|vers parts of the Empire; that there were De|&s;igns to depo&s;e the Grand Signior, and &s;et one of his Brothers on the Throne; be&s;ides a mul|titude of other Dangers; the re&s;olution of the Court's removal, and of the Grand Signior's March into <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> was &s;u&s;pended; his Pre|&s;ence and Authority being e&s;teemed mo&s;t requi|&s;ite in &s;uch a conjuncture of Troubles at the Heart and Center of his Empire. After which, the appearance of the Grand Signior in Publick was le&s;s frequent; for that he might ha&s;ten the departure of the Spahees and Jani&s;aries for <HI>Can|dia,</HI> he deferred his Journey to <HI>Adrianople</HI> for &s;ome time; but they being aver&s;e to this War, refu&s;ed to march, until fir&s;t they had received all Arrears which were due to them; the which audacious Propo&s;al &s;o incen&s;ed the Grand Sig|nior, that he cau&s;ed the Heads of two of the mo&s;t forward Mutineers to be cut off in his pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>This un&s;ea&s;onable rigour rather provoked the Spirits of di&s;contented Men, than abated them; and the continual Prizes which the Venetians made on the Turks, and &s;toppage of Provi&s;ions, which did u&s;ually &s;upply <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> from the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> rai&s;ed the price of Bread, and of all Victuals in that populous City; &s;o that the People murmured and exclaimed, as if they had been reduced to their la&s;t Extremity.</P>
<P>The Grand Vizier con&s;idering that the lo&s;s of <HI>Tenedos</HI> was the cau&s;e of all the&s;e Inconviences; promi&s;ed the Inhabitants of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> that he would regain it in a &s;hort time; in order to which, he &s;et forth a very numerous Fleet to be|&s;iege that Fortre&s;s; but contrary Winds, and bad Weather, forced them into a Neighbouring Port, where they attended the conjunction of the Bey's Gallies with them.</P>
<P>The General of the Venetians having received advice herof, put to Sea, that he might hinder the&s;e two Fleets from joining; and was no &s;ooner in the Channel of <HI>Scio,</HI> than that he met with ten Sail of Barbery Men of War, convoy|ing a great number of Saiques, and other Ve&s;|&s;els, of which fourteen were laden with Provi|&s;ions, carrying al&s;o with them two hundred
<PB N="90" REF="48">thou&s;and Crowns, which was the Tribute of <HI>Rhodes:</HI> The&s;e the Venetians a&s;&s;ailed with &s;uch Courage and Succe&s;s, that they burnt the ten Ships, and many of the Saiques; killed a thou|&s;and Turks, took four hundred Pri&s;oners, deli|vered three hundred Chri&s;tians; with the lo&s;s only of an hundred killed, and three hundred wounded.</P>
<P>This and other Lo&s;&s;es augmented the Di&s;con|tents at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> &s;o that the Grand Vizier, to hold up the Spirit of the People, re&s;olved to go in Per&s;on to <HI>Tenedos;</HI> and accordingly equipped a Fleet of eighteen Ships, thirty Gal|lies, ten Gallea&s;&s;es, with an innumerable Com|pany of Saiques, and other Ve&s;&s;els, whereon he embarked twenty thou&s;and Hor&s;e, and eighty thou&s;and Foot; with which Army the Vizier &s;ai|led out of the <HI>Dardanelli,</HI> on the <HI>17th</HI> of <HI>July,</HI> having fir&s;t received Intelligence, that <HI>Mocenigo</HI> was not returned from the <HI>Morea,</HI> where he had been for &s;ome time in cha&s;e of certain Ships. How&s;oever the Turks found not the Pa&s;&s;age &s;o clear, but that they encountred with a Squa|dron of eighteen Sail of Men of War, under the Command of Signior <HI>Bembo;</HI> the which &s;eem|ing an incon&s;iderable number to the Turks, they a&s;&s;ailed them with undoubted hopes of Victory. The Admiral and Vice-Admiral of the Turks, with five other great Ships, charged the Vene|tian Admiral, who defended him&s;elf &s;o bravely, that for three hours they lay Board and Board; the re&s;t of the Turki&s;h Fleet a&s;&s;ailed the other part of their Enemies Fleet &s;o clo&s;e, that the Fight became terrible and bloody, both for one and the other, until at length the Turks being wor&s;ted, were put to flight, and in the pur&s;uit, a great Turki&s;h Sultana was put a&s;hore near <HI>Troy;</HI> one of their Gallea&s;&s;es was di&s;abled, two of their Ships &s;unk, and the re&s;t were cha&s;ed as far as <HI>Metylene,</HI> being put by the I&s;land of <HI>Tenedos.</HI></P>
<P>In this Interim, the General <HI>Mocenigo</HI> was on his Voyage towards the <HI>Dardanelli;</HI> and being come within the noi&s;e of the Cannon, he ha|&s;tened with more diligence; and arrived &s;o &s;ea|&s;onably to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Bembo,</HI> that at his appearance mo&s;t of the Turki&s;h Gallies began to turn their Sterns, and make towards the Shore of <HI>Anatolia,</HI> with &s;uch di&s;order, that of twenty eight Gallies, and two Gallea&s;&s;es, there were but five only which kept company with the Ba&s;tard Gally of the Captain-Pa&s;ha, and en|tred with him under the defence of the Ca&s;tles. The re&s;t of the Fleet was cha&s;ed by <HI>Mocenigo;</HI> but the Turks being to windward, the Chri&s;ti|ans were not able that day to come up with there. The next day the Wind being more fa|vourable, a Council of War was held aboard the Venetian General; during which Con&s;ulta|tion, they e&s;pied five Gallies making towards the Point <HI>Baba,</HI> there to &s;ecure them&s;elves under the Shore: and thereupon re&s;olved, that whil&s;t the Captain General, with a Squadron of <HI>Mal|ta,</HI> attempted tho&s;e five Gallies, and others which had taken the &s;ame place of Refuge, the re&s;t of the Fleet &s;hould keep firing at tho&s;e without.</P>
<P>Accordingly the Captain-General made to|wards the Point <HI>Baba,</HI> where pa&s;&s;ing within Musket-&s;hot, and under the reach of five Batte|ries, an unfortunate Shot in the Powder-room blew up the Ship, and therewith ended the Days of this valiant <HI>Mocenigo,</HI> who died full of Ho|nour and Glory; his brave Actions continuing his Memory in all the Hi&s;tories of <HI>Venice.</HI> The Proyeditor &s;ucceeding in his Command, pro&s;e|cuted the &s;ame De&s;ign; and as if he would imi|tate the ancient Funeral Piles, he celebrated the Ob&s;equies of his General, by burning the Ad|miral Gally of the Turks, and thence retired towards <HI>Tenedos.</HI></P>
<P>After the Turks had refitted their Ve&s;&s;els, and put their Fleet in a rea&s;onable po&s;ture, they de|parted from <HI>Metylene</HI> the <HI>28th</HI> of <HI>July</HI> at Night, and on the <HI>30th</HI> were on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Tenedos;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tenedos</HI> taken by the Turks.</NOTE> where immediatly landing five thou&s;and Men, and great numbers approaching ready to &s;et their foot on Shore, the Defendants of the For|tre&s;s &s;ummoned a Council of War; at which all agreeing that the I&s;land was not tenable again&s;t &s;o great a Force, embarked their Men, Ammu|nition, and Artillery, and re&s;igned their place to the di&s;po&s;al and command of the Enemy. After which Succe&s;s the Turks in like manner landed ten thou&s;and Men on the I&s;land of <HI>Lem|nos;</HI> where, having laid a formal Siege to the Ca&s;tle, they made a general A&s;&s;ault, but were repul&s;ed with the lo&s;s of five hundred Men, leaving their Scaling-Ladders to the Be&s;ieged. They made afterwards divers Attempts, but in all were beaten off with con&s;iderable lo&s;s; &s;o that they had abandoned the Enterprize, had not the greater fear and apprehen&s;ion of the Divan at Home, confirmed their Courage a|gain&s;t the Enemy; until at length the Chri&s;tians being wearied with two Months Siege,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lemons</HI> retaken.</NOTE> without hopes of Relief, were forced to a Surrender; which was performed on Articles, That they &s;hould depart with Arms, Baggage, and have free liberty to embark them&s;elves for <HI>Candia.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e two important Places being regained by the Turks, were the Subject of great Joy to the Court, and of Courage and Satisfaction to the Inhabitants of <HI>Con&s;tantinople:</HI> So that the Grand Signior apprehending that by the&s;e Suc|ce&s;&s;es, the Seditions and Mutinies of the City were appea&s;ed, he took his Journey to <HI>Adriano|ple;</HI> where to evidence his Grandeur to the Bai|lo <HI>Capello,</HI> and the Secretary <HI>Ballarino,</HI> he made his entry with an Army of twenty thou&s;and Men, be&s;ides the ordinary Attendance of the Court, and u&s;ual Concomitants of the Ottoman Train.</P>
<P>After which O&s;tentation, the Grand Signior encharged <HI>Ballarino</HI> to write to the Senate, That though he was able to over-run all their Country, and take from them their Capital City, yet &s;uch was his Clemency, that he was contented to grant them Peace, on Conditions that they &s;ur|rendred to him all the I&s;land of <HI>Candia,</HI> with the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Cli&s;&s;ia</HI> in <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> and paiment of three Millions of Gold for the Dammages of the War.</P>
<P>But the&s;e &s;eemed to the Senate to be &s;uch un|rea&s;onable Propo&s;itions, and &s;o prejudicial to their Honour, that they re&s;olved to maintain the War, and to defend them&s;elves more vigo|rou&s;ly than ever.</P>

<HEAD>ANNO <HI>1658.</HI></HEAD>
<P>NOtwith&s;tanding the De&s;igns of the Turks again&s;t <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> they were not le&s;s intent to their Affairs in <HI>Candia,</HI> de&s;igning to try their Fortune once again in the Siege of the principal City of that Name, for that falling into their Hands, the whole I&s;land would quickly be re|duced, and with that Conque&s;t an end would be put unto the War.</P>
<P>The Venetians, on the other &s;ide, attended to their Bu&s;ine&s;s with all diligence, not neglecting any Provi&s;ions which might &s;ecure their Intere&s;t
<PB N="91" REF="48">in that Country; and that they might regain what they had lo&s;t, they held Intelligence with &s;ome Per&s;ons in <HI>Canea,</HI> hoping by their means to &s;urpri&s;e the Town; but the Turki&s;h Gover|nour, being very vigilant, reinforced his Gari|&s;on with five hundred Men: and <HI>Chu&s;aein</HI> Pa&s;ha coming to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance with thirty Gallies, di&s;|appointed the Venetians of landing at that place.</P>
<P>The Rendezvous of the Army which was to march into <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> was ordered to be at <HI>A|drianople,</HI> where the Brother-in-Law of the Pa|&s;ha of <HI>Aleppo,</HI> who was Commander of the Forces of that Place, arriving later than the day prefixed, was for that rea&s;on put to death by the Great Vizier.</P>
<P>This Severity &s;o enraged the Pa&s;ha, that im|mediately he rai&s;ed an Army of forty thou&s;and Men, and marched towards <HI>Scutari,</HI> threatning <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> it &s;elf, unle&s;s the Head of the Great Vizier were given him by way of repri|zal for that of his Brothers. The Divan being &s;tartled hereat, returned him a gentle Me&s;&s;age, neither denying nor granting his Demand, as if they intended to amu&s;e him with Hopes: But he interpreting this Delay for a Refu&s;al, did not only perfi&s;t in requiring the Head of the Vizier, but of four other principal Coun&s;ellors, whom he judged to have concurred in the Sentence for his Brother's Death; and in farther pro&s;ecu|tion hereof, he burnt and &s;poiled all the Coun|try about <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> and the Plague raging at the &s;ame time in the City, affected the Inhabi|tants with &s;uch Sadne&s;s and Di&s;content, that the chief Mini&s;ters apprehended more Evil from thence, than from the Enemy without.</P>
<P>The Army of the Pa&s;ha daily increa&s;ing, and being grown from forty to &s;ixty thou&s;and Men, cau&s;ed the Vizier to abandon all other Thoughts and De&s;igns but tho&s;e which tended to the de|&s;truction of the Pa&s;ha, and his Complices; &s;o that there nece&s;&s;arily followed a Revul&s;ion of the Forces from <HI>Dalmatia;</HI> the Vizier him&s;elf diverting them from thence and <HI>Tran&s;ylvania,</HI> marched with the whole Army towards <HI>Con&s;tan|tinople.</HI></P>
<P>Yet before the Great Vizier departed from <HI>Adrianople,</HI> he per&s;waded the Grand Signior to &s;et the Bailo <HI>Capello,</HI> and the Secretary <HI>Ballarino</HI> at Liberty, that thereby he might give &s;ome jea|lou&s;y to the Rebels, as if he de&s;igned to make a Peace with <HI>Venice,</HI> to have more Power, and better leizure to make his War again&s;t them. This Coun&s;el, though prudently given, had yet little Influence on the Humor of the Pa&s;ha, who continued his March, fortifying him&s;elf in the mo&s;t advantageous Pa&s;&s;es of the Country: But what was mo&s;t bold of all his Actions, and rendred his Pardon beyond the Clemency of his Soveraign, was the proclaiming a Youth of twenty Years of Age, then with him in his Ar|my, to be the Son of Sultan <HI>Morat,</HI> and con&s;e|quently the lawful Heir of the Crown; and that in right of him, he had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a great part of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and was marching towards <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> with re&s;olution to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s Sul|tan <HI>Mehmet,</HI> and exalt this lawful and undoubted Heir on the Throne of his Ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>This and other Rumors from <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> that that King taking the advantage of the&s;e Di&s;orders, was making Preparations to regain <HI>Bagdat,</HI> or <HI>Babylon,</HI> and revenge him&s;elf of all tho&s;e Cruelties which the Turks had inflicted on his Subjects and Country, increa&s;ed the Fears and Cares of the chief Mini&s;ters of State.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding which, <HI>Chu&s;aein</HI> Pa&s;ha pro|&s;ecuted his Bu&s;ine&s;s no le&s;s in <HI>Candia</HI> than for|merly, in hopes to put an end to the War there before the end of the Summer; and in order thereunto, he received a Recruit of five and twenty thou&s;and Men from the <HI>Morea.</HI> But the daily increa&s;e of the Pa&s;ha's Forces, and his ap|proach towards <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> as it was a Mat|ter of the highe&s;t Con&s;equence, &s;o it required the mo&s;t prudence and caution in the manage|ment.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place therefore by <HI>Fetfa,</HI> or Re|&s;olve from the Mufti, the Pa&s;ha was declared a Rebel, and guilty of High Trea&s;on again&s;t the Sultan; notwith&s;tanding which, a Chaous was di&s;patched with Letters of Pardon, if now re|penting of his Fault, he would disband his Ar|my, and return to his former Obedience, he &s;hould be received into Grace and Favour. The Pa&s;ha received the Chaous with the &s;ame Cere|mony and Honour, as if he had been an Amba&s;|&s;ador, being willing to con&s;ider him under that Character, rather than under the Notion of a Pur&s;uivant, or Officer &s;ent to affright him into his Duty; and in An&s;wer to the Me&s;&s;age, re|plied, That it was not in his power to conde&s;|cend to any Conditions, for that &s;ince he had a&s;&s;umed the Cau&s;e of this Youth, who was the Son of Sultan <HI>Morat,</HI> concealed to that Age by his Mother, for fear of the Power of his Uncle, he could not a&s;&s;ent to any Terms or Conditions le&s;s than the Exaltation of him to the Ottoman Throne. And &s;o carrying this Young Man with him, as a Property, whereby to cover his Rebel|lion with the Gui&s;e of Ju&s;tice and Duty, he maintained a Court for him after the Ottoman Fa&s;hion; and cau&s;ing the Tagho, or Standards, to be carried before him, he permitted him to give Audiences, &s;end Di&s;patches, and to take on him all the Royal Marks of Empire.</P>
<P>The Army of the Pa&s;ha was by this time en|crea&s;ed to &s;eventy thou&s;and Men, one part of which he &s;ent towards <HI>Scutari,</HI> and another to|wards <HI>Smyrna,</HI> which alarm'd all the Countries round about, and gave the Grand Signior &s;uch cau&s;e of Apprehen&s;ion, that he tried divers Means, and made many Propo&s;itions of Ho|nours and Benefits to the Pa&s;ha, whereby to al|lure him to Obedience: One while he offered to him the Government of <HI>Grand Cairo:</HI> but that being rejected, he endeavoured to rai&s;e Men in <HI>A&s;ia</HI> to oppo&s;e the progre&s;s of his Arms; of which &s;ome numbers being got into a Body, and perceiving the formidable Force of the Pa|&s;ha, revolted, and joined them&s;elves to his Party.</P>
<P>This Extremity of Affairs, cau&s;ed the Grand Signior not only again to proclaim the Pa&s;ha a Rebel, but to give liberty to his People to de|&s;troy him and his Souldiers in any parts where they &s;hould encounter them. In pur&s;uance of which Licen&s;e, a Village in <HI>A&s;ia</HI> having killed twenty five or thirty of the Pa&s;ha's Men, which came thither to refre&s;h them&s;elves; the Pa&s;ha was &s;o enraged thereat, that he cau&s;ed his Souldiers to put Man, Woman, and Child to the Sword throughout the Village. And in this manner the Affairs of the Turks remained in the greate&s;t Confu&s;ion imaginable through the whole cour&s;e of this Year 1658.</P>

<HEAD>ANNO <HI>1659.</HI></HEAD>
<P>NOR did this Year begin with better Omens of Succe&s;s, for to the other Dangers, was added a Report, that the Per&s;ian had taken the Field with two hundred thou&s;and Men, for re|covery
<PB N="92" REF="49">of <HI>Bagdat,</HI> or <HI>Babylon,</HI> which was the ancient Patrimony of his Forefathers; &s;o that the Grand Signior being rendred thereby more willing to agree and accommodate Affairs with the Pa&s;ha, proffered to him the Government of the Province of <HI>Soria</HI> for ever, paying only a yearly Homage of an hundred thou&s;and Sulta|nees, in lieu of three hundred thou&s;and, which that Country always yielded. But the Pride of the Pa&s;ha &s;corned a Proffer of &s;o mean a Con&s;i|deration, having nothing le&s;s in his Thoughts than the entire enjoyment of the Empire, or at lea&s;t to partake an equal &s;hare thereof with the Sultan.</P>
<P>For the Hopes of the Pa&s;ha encrea&s;ing with his Army, which was now grown to eighty thou|&s;and Men, he took up for &s;ome days his Head|quarters near the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Tocacaia,</HI> within the days march of <HI>Smyrna;</HI> and thence ap|proaching towards <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> the chief Mi|ni&s;ters concluded, that there was no other Safety but in their Arms; and that the Pa&s;ha was not to be reduced to any terms of Gentlene&s;s or Moderation. Accordingly the Great Vizier pa&s;|&s;ed into <HI>A&s;ia</HI> with a numerous Army, and &s;pee|dily joined Battel with the Pa&s;ha, which conti|nued for &s;ome Hours with great &s;laughter on one &s;ide and the other; but at length the fortune of the Day turned in favour of the Pa&s;ha; and the Vizier's Army being routed, he lo&s;t all his Can|non and Baggage, and he him&s;elf was forced to &s;ave him&s;elf in the Neighbouring Countries; where not being pur&s;ued by the Pa&s;ha, he had time again to collect his torn and &s;cattered Troops. The News hereof multiplied the Di&s;|orders and Confu&s;ions at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> to which being added the Motion of the Per&s;ians, and that they were to join with the Pa&s;ha; as al&s;o &s;ome Troubles in <HI>Tran&s;ylvania,</HI> cau&s;ed by the unquiet Spirit of <HI>Ragotski,</HI> together with the ill Humour of the Male-contents in the City, made all things appear with equal or greater Danger at Home than Abroad.</P>
<P>Wherefore, as the ultimate Remedy of the&s;e imminent Dangers it was re&s;olved, that the Grand Signior &s;hould go in Per&s;on to the War, on &s;uppo&s;ition that Reverence to his Royal Per|&s;on would produce that awe on the Spirits of his Subjects, which was not to be effected by Violence, or force of Arms. According to this Re&s;olution the Grand Signior pa&s;&s;ed into <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and joining his Forces with tho&s;e of the Vizi|er, compo&s;ed an Army of &s;eventy thou&s;and Foot, and thirty thou&s;and Hor&s;e; with which marching boldly towards the Enemy, the Heart of the Pa&s;ha began to fail him; &s;o that calling a Council of his Officers, he propo&s;ed his In|clinations towards Terms of Agreement, rather than to hazard all on the Uncertainties of a Battel; the Spirits of the Souldiery being now become tractable by the appearance of &s;o great a Force, a&s;&s;ented to the Propo&s;ition; and there|upon Articles being &s;peedily drawn up, were &s;ent to the Grand Signior for his Approbation; who, though he would not &s;eem to refu&s;e any thing therein contained, yet declined a per&s;o|nal Treaty, as being a Matter too mean for his Imperial Per&s;on to capitulate with his Va&s;&s;als; and therefore ordered, that <HI>Mortaza</HI> Pa&s;ha &s;hould Treat in his behalf, promi&s;ing to confirm what&s;oever Act <HI>Mortaza</HI> Pa&s;ha &s;hould conclude in this Matter.</P>
<P><HI>Mortaza</HI> being thus made Plenipotentiary, re|fu&s;ed to treat with the Pa&s;ha, until &s;uch time as he had retreated with his Army at a di&s;tance of &s;ome days March from the Grand Signior's Camp; which being performed near a Town called <HI>Alexandria,</HI> he fooli&s;hly &s;uffered him&s;elf to be &s;eparated in a private Place from his Ar|my, on pretence that Peace was more aptly concluded in a free Retirement, than under the con&s;traint and force of the Souldiery. Here <HI>Mortaza</HI> meeting the Pa&s;ha, forcibly &s;trangled him, with &s;eventeen of his Complices, whom he had brought with him for Witne&s;&s;es to his Capitulations with the Grand Signior. With the news hereof the Army of the Pa&s;ha &s;oon disbanded, every one with &s;hame and &s;ilence &s;hifting for him&s;elf, retired to his own Coun|try and Home. And herewith ea&s;ily ended this Civil War almo&s;t in a moment, which but now threatned the Extirpation of the Ottoman Race.</P>
<P>The cruel Vizier retained his thoughts of Re|venge, which we &s;hall &s;hortly hear in what manner he vented on the great Spahees and rich Men in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> who had joined them&s;elves with the Pa&s;ha in this Rebellion. This good Service promoted <HI>Mortaza,</HI> and rendred him more con|&s;iderable to the Grand Signior; &s;o that he was employed in the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Tartars, again&s;t <HI>Ragotski</HI> in <HI>Tran&s;ylvania,</HI> and afterwards preferred to the important Charge of <HI>Bagdat,</HI> or <HI>Babylon,</HI> of who&s;e Succe&s;s, and Fate, we we &s;hall hear in the Sequal of a few Years.</P>
<P>But as yet the Commotions of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> were not &s;o wholly extingui&s;hed, but that the Nephew of the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Aleppo,</HI> in revenge of the trea|cherous Death of his Uncle, took up Arms, and was followed by the People of the Territories depending on <HI>Aleppo.</HI> To his A&s;&s;i&s;tance came in al&s;o the Son of <HI>Chu&s;aein</HI> Pa&s;ha, late General in <HI>Candia,</HI> whom the cruel Vizier had put to death, notwith&s;tanding the merit of his late Services, which might &s;eem to atone for his former Misfortunes, and make &s;atisfaction for non-compliance with In&s;tructions; but this Vi|zier, who never pardoned any Per&s;on, would not begin with an Act of Clemency towards one who was none of his Creatures or Confi|dents depending on him.</P>
<P>To the&s;e joined the Bey of <HI>Torgue,</HI> who ca&s;t|ing off his Obedience to the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Cairo,</HI> entred into the Cabal with ten thou&s;and Hor&s;e; &s;o that a formidable Army being compo&s;ed by this Union, gave a new &s;ubject of Fear and Ap|prehen&s;ion at <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> But the Great Vi|zier &s;o dextrou&s;ly managed his Affair, by &s;ow|ing Di&s;&s;ention between the Chiefs, and be&s;tow|ing Large&s;&s;es on the Souldiery, that the Army un&s;en&s;ibly mouldred away, leaving their Gene|rals, and Commanders to &s;hift for them&s;elves, and expo&s;ing them to the Ju&s;tice of a Vizier, who was unacquainted with Mercy, and never pardoned any who was either guilty of a Fault, or &s;upected for it.</P>
<P>Towards the end of this Year, the Vizier built the lower Forts, which are &s;cituated at the entrance into the <HI>Dardanelles,</HI> commonly called by the name of the Queen-Mother's Ca&s;tles. And di&s;patched a Chaous to the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Ca|nea,</HI> to put all things in a Readine&s;s for the Siege of <HI>Candia;</HI> Orders were al&s;o given to the Pa&s;haws of the Inland Countries to prepare them|&s;elves for the Wars again&s;t <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> and <HI>Tran|&s;ilvania.</HI></P>

This Vizier <HI>Kuper|lee,</HI> though aged, was yet very active and vigo|rous, by which he created &s;o much confidence of him&s;elf in his Ma&s;ter, that he acted nothing in all the Government but by his Coun&s;el and Direction: which being always jealous and bloo|dy towards tho&s;e who had any Power in the Empire, he for that Rea&s;on cut off the Ca&s;ir of <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> who though he was a good Go|vernour, and a faithful Servant, yet becau&s;e he was a Favourite of the Queen-Mother, and con|&s;erved the State of his Affairs in a laudable po|&s;ture, he grew jealous of his Power, and there|fore &s;acrificed his Blood to his own Security and Bloody Di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>The which act of unju&s;t Cruelty &s;o enraged the Queen-Mother, that &s;he for ever after bore a mortal hatred to this Vizier, and continued the &s;ame to his Son, which was the famous <HI>Kuperlee;</HI> but his Moderation and Di&s;cretion was &s;o well tempered with re&s;pect towards her, that She at length not only pardoned the Sin of his Father in him, but became his Friend, and reli&s;hed the Services which he performed for his Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>The Venetians having about this time received con&s;iderable Succours, namely four thou&s;and French Foot, which his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, after the Conclu&s;ion of Peace at the <HI>Pyrenean</HI> Treaty, had mo&s;t generou&s;ly Spared to that Re|publick, were enabled to attempt &s;ome notable Enterpaize; and thereby &s;o hardly pre&s;&s;ed the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Canea,</HI> that he earne&s;tly wrote to the Grand Signior for Succours; a&s;&s;uring him, that without pre&s;ent Relief, he &s;hould be forced to &s;urrender his Town to the Mercy of the Ene|my. The Grand Signior promi&s;ed him &s;peedy Relief, and for his better encouragement &s;ent him the Pre&s;ent of a Sword and a Ve&s;t of Sa|bles; in the mean time the Venetians took three Forts, <HI>viz. Calamo, Calegro,</HI> and <HI>Epicarno,</HI> and proceeded to lay Siege to <HI>Canea;</HI> but the Ene|my having received a Supply of three thou&s;and Men into the Town, the Chri&s;tians quitted this enterprize in hopes of beating the Turks out of new <HI>Candia;</HI> which was lately built near to the old <HI>Candia,</HI> with de&s;ign to keep that Town &s;traitned by perpetual Alarms, and by the vi|cinity of &s;o bad a Neighbourhood.</P>
<P>The Grand Vizer being very Aged, was &s;ubject to many Infirmities, and falling &s;ick at <HI>Belgrade,</HI> he was advi&s;ed by the Phy&s;icians to change the Air, as the be&s;t Remedy for his Di&s;ea&s;e; and indeed they were all careful to give him the be&s;t and &s;afe&s;t Coun&s;els, for that he often threatned them, if he died of that Sickne&s;s, he would &s;end them all to the next World before him. The Vizier following the Advice of his Phy&s;icians, returned to <HI>Adrianople,</HI> where ha|ving in a good mea&s;ure recovered his Health, he &s;ent Orders to <HI>Hali</HI> Pa&s;ha, then General of the Forces in <HI>Hungary,</HI> to ha&s;ten the Siege of <HI>Wara|din,</HI> being e&s;teemed by the Turks an advantagious Fortre&s;s for carrying on their Conque&s;ts in that Country; of the taking of which Town, and of all the Trouble in <HI>Tran&s;ylvania,</HI> cau&s;ed by the ambitious humour of <HI>Ragotzki,</HI> we &s;hall treat at large in the following Hi&s;tory. For being come to that time, in which Providence allotted me a charge at <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> I was thereby &s;omewhat elevated on a ri&s;ing Ground, whereby I could with my own Eyes &s;urvey the Tran&s;actions of that great Empire; and for that Rea&s;on I call them my Memoirs; which for being Matters tran&s;acted in my own Time, I have thought fit to introduce them with a &s;hort Adverti&s;ement to the Reader.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Courteous Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS following Hi&s;tory is &s;ome part of tho&s;e fruits ari&s;ing from my vacant hours of eighteen Years re&s;idence in <HI>Turky,</HI> &s;even whereof I compleated at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> in quality of Secretary to the Lord Amba&s;&s;ador; and for eleven Years I exerci&s;ed the Office of Con&s;ul at <HI>Smyrna.</HI> In the fir&s;t times of which, I had great advantages to ob&s;erve, and make my Annotations; having for the mo&s;t part been acquainted with the per&s;ons as well as with the affairs of tho&s;e concern|ing whom I write; and indeed the incumbence which was then upon me, obliged me to a know|ledg both of per&s;ons and bu&s;ine&s;s. My latter time, which was that of being Con&s;ul, con|&s;trained me to an attendance on matters relating to the government of our Trade; and there|fore it is not to be expected, that at that di&s;tance from the Court, I &s;hould lay down Tran&s;acti|ons &s;o po&s;itive, and particular, as in the preceding Years; yet the acquaintance, and corre|&s;pondence I afterwards continued at Court, and the care I took to inform my &s;elf of what oc|curred, qualified me in &s;ome mea&s;ure for an Hi&s;torian; at lea&s;t put me into a condition to make a Breviate, or Collection of certain Ob&s;ervations occurring in the Turki&s;h Court.</P>
<P>When I fir&s;t entred on this work, I was carried with a certain emulation of <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI> Writers, of who&s;e Mini&s;ters few there were employed in the parts of <HI>Turky,</HI> but who carried with them from thence, Memoirs, Giornals, or Hi&s;torical Ob&s;ervations of their times. In which our Nation hath been &s;o defective, that be&s;ides &s;ome &s;cattered and abrupt Papers, without coherence, or method, adjoined to the end of <HI>Knoll</HI>'s Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Turks</HI> (which is an excellent collection from divers Authors.) one &s;hall &s;carce find five &s;heets of Pa|per wrote by our Countrymen in way of Hi&s;tory. At which omi&s;&s;ion having often wondred, I re&s;olved from my fir&s;t entrance in tho&s;e Countries, to note down in a blank Book what occurred in that Empire, either as to Civil, or Military affairs; with what Ca&s;ualties and Changes befel our Trade, that &s;o both one and the other might &s;erve for Examples and Precedents to future Ages; the which after &s;ome years afforded me materials to compo&s;e and frame this following Di&s;cour&s;e. In which, having by Gods a&s;&s;i&s;tance thus far proceeded; As it may be an Example to my Succe&s;&s;ors, to &s;pin and draw out the thread of this Hi&s;tory through Ages to come; &s;o it will be a good part, and office, of tho&s;e who re&s;ide there at pre&s;ent, by a more diligent enquiry to correct, and amend what I have mi&s;taken, or mi&s;under&s;tood.</P>
<P>For next to the immediate attendance to the Charge and Tru&s;t impo&s;ed upon me, I judged it a chief duty towards my Country, to denote and Record certain Tran&s;actions relating to Trade, which is the grand Intere&s;t that hath engaged <HI>England</HI> to a Communication and Cor|re&s;pondence with the&s;e remote Parts: nor doth the World perhaps expect much le&s;s from me, than that I &s;hould add &s;omething to the Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Turks</HI> in our time; which how&s;oever imperfectly I may perform it, yet the Offices which I have exerci&s;ed, and the impartiality with which it is wrote, may gain it &s;ome credit and reputation in the World. For in the wri|ting hereof, I cannot be taxed with animo&s;ity to any per&s;on; nor am I to be e&s;teemed as po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed with affection, or partiality to any &s;ide; which is a point of &s;obriety, and good temper, nece&s;&s;ary for all Hi&s;torians: For we who lived in tho&s;e parts, were little concerned for the Hou&s;e of <HI>Kuperlee,</HI> or for the Favourites of the Court; nor was it of any moment to us, whether the Faction of the <HI>Spahees,</HI> or <HI>Janizaries</HI> prevailed; or whether the Courtiers, or the Soldiers, ruled the Empire: only we e&s;teemed it our duty, to &s;peak be&s;t of that Govern|ment under which our Trade thrived mo&s;t. And tho the times of <HI>Sultan Ibrahim</HI> were the golden days for Merchants, which employed our Navigation beyond the memory of any times, either before, or &s;ince; and con&s;umed of our Manufactories (tho not in greater quantities yet) perhaps with better advantage and profit to our Nation: Yet I ought not to be &s;o injuri|ous, or ungrateful to <HI>Sultan Mahomet</HI> the Fourth, as to accu&s;e his Government of Oppre&s;&s;ion, or Violence towards us, or of any breach of Articles, and Priviledges, which he had granted to his Majesties Subjects; but &s;hall rather applaud, and be ready to own that Justice which our Complaints have found, and met at the Ottoman Court, under the protection of tho&s;e worthy Amba&s;&s;adors &s;ent by his Majesty to stand Centinel on the Guard of their Country.</P>
<P>For whereas in the time of <HI>Sultan Morat,</HI> when the Military men bore the &s;way; Injustice and Violence, which mingled in all the actions of Rule, had an influence al&s;o on the Engli&s;h
<PB REF="52">affairs: And when in the time of <HI>Sultan Ibrahim,</HI> that the Female Court had gained the predominancy, and that va&s;t Trea&s;ures were expended in Riot and Luxury; the prodigality of great per&s;ons made it nece&s;&s;ary to be rapacious and unju&s;t: But in the&s;e more moderate times of this pre&s;ent Sultan, when neither exce&s;&s;ive Wars abroad, nor Luxury nor immode|rate expence at home, exhau&s;ted the Coffers; We may ea&s;ily imagine, that the di&s;orders of State did not drive the Rulers to a nece&s;&s;ity of exerci&s;ing unju&s;t Arts, which are always mo&s;t certain Symptoms, either of a bad Government, or a vicious incliuation in the Prince.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h Trade, according to the Chronicles of Sir <HI>Richard Baker,</HI> was fir&s;t introduced into the Country of the <HI>Turks,</HI> in the Year 1579. but <HI>Sagredo</HI> an <HI>Italian</HI> Writer, accounts only from the Year <HI>1583.</HI> perhaps before that time Overtures were only made for a Trade, which might be &s;o incon&s;iderable, as that until then it was not e&s;teemed worthy to be adorned with an Amba&s;&s;ador, or to be oppo&s;ed by the Mini&s;ters of Foreign Princes. For &s;o &s;oon as an Amba&s;&s;ador from <HI>England</HI> appeared at the Ottoman Court, with Credential Letters from Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Venetian</HI> Mini&s;ters took the Alarm, and oppo&s;ed his re|ception, e&s;pecially the <HI>French,</HI> who (as <HI>Sagredo</HI> reports in his Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Turks</HI>) re|pre&s;ented unto the G. Vizier, how much this new Friend&s;hip with the Engli&s;h would ob&s;truct that ancient Alliance which was made with his King, and would impeach and le&s;&s;en the Pri|viledges and Trade which they enjoyed in tho&s;e parts: To which the Vizier an&s;wered, ac|cording to their u&s;ual phra&s;e and &s;tile; That the happy Imperial Seat where his Ma&s;ter re|&s;ided, was called the <HI>Port,</HI> becau&s;e it was free and open to all &s;uch who de&s;ired to take re|fuge and &s;anctuary therein, and therefore the Engli&s;h without ju&s;t rea&s;on ought not to be ex|cluded. That the Sultan ought not to be denied that freedom of love and hatred, which was common to all Mankind; and that he was as well re&s;olved to chu&s;e and cheri&s;h his Friends, as to pro&s;ecute and de&s;troy his Enemies. Whereunto the French Amba&s;&s;ador urged, That &s;ince it was the plea&s;ure of the Grand Signior to admit the Engli&s;h; that at lea&s;t they &s;hould be obliged to enter <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> under the French Colours. But the Engli&s;h Amba&s;&s;ador replied, that his Mi&s;tre&s;s who was &s;o potent, &s;corned all Dependencies on other Nations, and would rather abandon the Friend&s;hip of the Sultan, than admit the lea&s;t diminution of her own honour: And embelli&s;hing his Di&s;cour&s;es (as <HI>Sagredo</HI> proceeds) with the repre&s;enta|tion of that advantage and profit, which the Engli&s;h Trade would bring to the Ottoman Em|pire; he &s;o en&s;nared the hearts of the Turks, that they preferred the admittance of new Gue&s;ts, before the Alliance of ancient Friends. Since which time our Commerce and Trade with the Turk hath been in its increa&s;e, and being governed by a Wi&s;e and Grave Company of Experienced Merchants, hath by Gods ble&s;&s;ing brought an ine&s;timable Trea&s;ure and advan|tage to the Engli&s;h Nation, which that it may &s;till continue, increa&s;e, and flouri&s;h in all Ages and times to come, is the hearty de&s;ire, and Prayer of him, who is a true, and faithful Ser|vant to that worthy Society, and a &s;incere Wellwi&s;her to his Country.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF Sultan Mahomet IV. THE XIII. EMPEROUR OF THE TURKS, Beginning in the NINTH YEAR OF HIS REIGN.</HEAD>

<P>IT was now the beginning of this Year, when the Earl of <HI>Winchel&s;ea</HI> arrived at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> the fir&s;t Emba&s;&s;adour &s;ent abroad from His Maje&s;ty of <HI>Great Britain, Charles</HI> the Second, after his happy Re|turn to the Glorious throne of his Ance|&s;tors, to <HI>Sultan Mahomet,</HI> the Thirteenth Em|perour of the Turks; it being judged fit, that among&s;t other Alliances which were to be con|tracted with Foreign Princes, and States, this of <HI>Turkey</HI> &s;hould not be omitted, but rather in the fir&s;t place con&s;idered: In regard, that as the flouri&s;hing E&s;tate and Pro&s;perity of <HI>England</HI>'s riche&s;s depends ab&s;olutely on her Foreign Trade, &s;o on none more particularly than on that of <HI>Turkey,</HI> which con&s;umes great quantities of her mo&s;t &s;taple and &s;ub&s;tantial Manufactures, and makes returns in what&s;oever Employs, and gives Bread to the poor and indu&s;trious of the Nation.</P>
<P>But before we come to treat of the Succe&s;&s;es of this Amba&s;&s;ador, and the various Tran&s;actions in the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Affairs; we &s;hall relate &s;ome ac|cidents which befel us in our Voyage by Sea to <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> The Earl of <HI>Winchel&s;ea</HI> and his Lady, with a numerous Retinue being embark|ed on the <HI>Plymouth</HI> Frigat, commanded by Sir <HI>Thomas Allen,</HI> and accompanied with a Catch and two Merchants Ships, the <HI>Pro&s;perous</HI> and <HI>Smyrna</HI> Factor for <HI>Turkey,</HI> &s;et &s;ail from the <HI>Downs</HI> on the Twentieth of <HI>Octob.</HI> 1660. And proceeding with a favourable Gale, and fair Weather, until we were come to the heighth of the Norward Cape, or Cape <HI>Fini&s;terre;</HI> we then contended with &s;o &s;evere a &s;torm, that we were forced to bring our Ship under a main cour&s;e, to fa&s;ten our Helm, and lye, and drive. In the Twenty nineth about Five in the Morning, our main Tack flew, which &s;hook and &s;trained our Ma&s;s &s;o violently, that it was &s;hivered in two places between Decks: The danger hereof might have proved of ill con&s;equence, had the Ma&s;t gone by the Board; for in all probability it would have carried up our Decks, unfixed both our Pumps, and laid us open to the Sea; but the Providence of God, and the diligence of our
<PB N="98" REF="53">Seamen was &s;uch, that we &s;oon &s;truck our Top Ma&s;t, boared our main Yard, and &s;o fi&s;hed the Ma&s;t it &s;elf where it was defective, that with the help of our &s;ore-Sail, and the benefit of bet|ter Weather we &s;afely arrived on the Thirty fir&s;t in the Port of <HI>Lisbon.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lisbon.</NOTE> The Match being then in Treaty between <HI>Charles</HI> the Second our Dread Soveraign, and <HI>Catherine</HI> the <HI>Infanta</HI> of <HI>Portugal,</HI> now our gracious Queen; all the concernments of <HI>England</HI> were extreamly acceptable to the Court of <HI>Portugal;</HI> and particularly the Per&s;on of the Earl of <HI>Winchel&s;ea,</HI> a Peer of <HI>England,</HI> qualified with the Character of Amba&s;&s;adour Extraordi|nary to the <HI>Ottomon</HI> Port. For at our fir&s;t arri|val there, I being then Secretary to the &s;aid Earl, was employed to carry a Letter to the King, which was received by the Councel of State then &s;itting: After the Letter had been read and con|&s;idered, I was called in, and an an&s;wer given me by the <HI>Marquis de Ni&s;&s;a,</HI> and <HI>D. Ga&s;per Faria de Sevarin</HI> then Secretary of State, to this purpo&s;e. That they were glad, &s;o grateful an opportu|nity pre&s;ented, whereby they might Demon|&s;trate their warm and real affections towards the King of <HI>England,</HI> by &s;erving his Amba&s;&s;adour in &s;o nece&s;&s;ary a piece of Service as that which was required: That Orders were given to fur|ni&s;h the Ship with a Ma&s;t, and what &s;he wanted, out of the Kings Stores; and that both his Ex|cellency and Lady, with all their Retinue &s;hould be welcomed a &s;hore, with due regard to their Quality and Condition. The Day following his Excellency was complemented from the King, by a <HI>Mae&s;tro de Campo</HI> &s;ent to him on Ship|board; and being come a&s;hoar, and lodged at the Hou&s;e of Mr. <HI>Maynard</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;ul, he was vi&s;ited by <HI>D. Franci&s;co de Melo,</HI> (who had be&s;ore, and was afterwards employed Amba&s;&s;a|dour into <HI>England</HI>) and by <HI>D. Antonio de Saou&s;a</HI> and others. After Eight days his Excellency had Audience of the King, and the Queen Mo|ther, and was received by both, with many de|mon&s;trations of a hearty de&s;ire to contract a firm Alliance with <HI>England.</HI> He was after|wards invited by the <HI>Conde de Odemira</HI> Governour of the young King, and Chief Mini&s;ter of <HI>Portu|gal,</HI> to a <HI>Quinta,</HI> or Garden-hou&s;e at <HI>Bellain:</HI> where were pre&s;ent the Duke of <HI>Calaval,</HI> the <HI>Vi&s;conde de Ca&s;tel Blanco,</HI> and <HI>D. Franci&s;co de Me|lo;</HI> the entertainment was very &s;plendid, with variety of Di&s;hes, and Wine, corre&s;ponding ra|ther with the inordinate Tables of <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> than with the frugality, and temperate Diet of <HI>Spa|niards.</HI> Our Ship being in this interim refitted, we returned aboard on the Twel&s;th of <HI>Novem|ber;</HI> the Earl of <HI>Winchel&s;ea</HI> being pre&s;ented by the King, with &s;everal Hampers of &s;weet-Meats, Ve&s;&s;els of Wine, and other Provi&s;ions for his Voyage; and his lady by the Queen Mother, with a Jewel of con&s;iderable value, and with diver&s;e boxes filled with Pur&s;es of per&s;umed Leather, and Amber Comfits.</P>
<P>On the Thirteenth we &s;et Sail, being de&s;ign'd by Order of his Maje&s;ty for <HI>Algier,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Algier.</NOTE> to &s;ettle a Peace with that un&s;etled People; where arriving on the Tewenty &s;econd day about Three a Clock in the Afternoon, we came to an Anchor about Two Miles di&s;tant from the Town, which we &s;aluted with Twenty one Guns, but re|ceived none again in an&s;wer thereunto; it being the cu&s;tome of that People, not to acknowledge Civilities, but to repay injuries, and not requite benefits. We found that they had already be|gun to break the Peace: Having brought in thi|ther an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship, which lay between hope and fear of freedom, or &s;eizure: So &s;oon as we had dropt our Anchors, a Boat came from that Ship, acquainting us of the State of <HI>Algter,</HI> and how near Matters were to a Rupture with them; by this Boat my Lord Amba&s;&s;adour &s;ent a Letter to the Con&s;ul, appointing him to come aboard; who the next Day, being the Twenty third, ap|peared accordingly; to whom his Excellency imparted the In&s;tructions and Orders from his Maje&s;ty to renew the Peace on the former Ar|ticles; and particularly to in&s;ert a Caution, That the <HI>Algerines</HI> &s;hould on no terms &s;earch our Ships, but that the Pa&s;&s;engers, and goods there|on, whether of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or Strangers, &s;hould be free and exempted from all &s;eizure, and Pyracy what&s;oever. I being appointed to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Con|&s;ul in this Treaty, accompanied him a&s;hoar, and in the fir&s;t place we applyed our &s;elves to <HI>Rama|dam Bullock-ba&s;hee,</HI> then the Chief of their Di|van, and Head of their Government; whom we acquainted, that on the Ship in the road, was an Earl of <HI>England,</HI> &s;ent Amba&s;&s;adour by his Ma|je&s;ty our King to the Grand Signor; and in his way thither was appointed to touch at <HI>Algier,</HI> and to inform the Government of that place of the happy Re&s;toration of his Maje&s;ty to the Throne of his Father, and to confirm the &s;ame Peace which was before concluded with u&s;urped Powers, and &s;o delivered him the Letters from his Maje&s;ty, which were &s;uper&s;cribed in this manner:</P>
<P><HI>To their Excellencies the Aga, Jiaba&s;hees, and re&s;t of the Honourable Council of State and War, in the City and Kingdom of</HI> Algier.</P>
<P><HI>Ramadam</HI> an&s;wered us, that he was well &s;atis|fied with the Propo&s;al; that there was a Peace already with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and that they were Brothers; that the next Day was appointed for a general Divan of great and &s;mall, at which we might freely open our brea&s;ts, and declare what&s;oever was committed to us by our King and his Amba&s;&s;adour.</P>

<P>The&s;e Articles being read, were all approved except the fir&s;t; for they declared, that they would have a Liberty to &s;earch our Ships, and take out the Goods and Per&s;ons of Strangers; for that otherwi&s;e, we having this priviledge, might carry away the Trade of the whole World in our Shipping; and that <HI>French, Spaniards, Italians, Dutch,</HI> and all other Nations, had no need of other protection and &s;afeguard for their Per&s;ons and Goods, than to put them under the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> colours: And that then their men of War might rove the Seas to no purpo&s;e, their City become poor, and their Souldiers &s;tarve, when they re|turned home. We on the other &s;ide, being &s;en|&s;ible how prejudicial and di&s;honourable &s;uch an Article as this would be, and how ruinous to our Navigation, and having his Maje&s;ties Command to the contrary, ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to a&s;&s;ent, or agree thereunto.

But neither this, nor any other argument was Rea&s;on, or Sence to them; nor did they care to an&s;wer it by other arguments, than that of their own di&s;advantage thereby; and that if they a&s;|&s;ented thereunto, their Ships might better rot in the Mould, than to venture them out at Sea with expectation of booty. They told us al&s;o &s;tories of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships which had delivered &s;ome <HI>Algerines</HI> to their Enemies; and one particularly, who had &s;old a Hundred <HI>Turks</HI> to the <HI>Venetians.</HI> In an&s;wer hereunto, we a&s;&s;ured them, that upon complaints and proofs made hereof to our King; his Ju&s;tice was &s;uch, as that he would not &s;uffer a piece of &s;uch Treachery to e&s;cape unpuni&s;hed.

But the&s;e People being Deaf and Blind to any Rea&s;on, but that which agrees with their intere&s;t, we concluded nothing; for after a long and loud di&s;cour&s;e, and repeti|tion of the &s;ame things over and over again, we at length told them, that it was not in our Commi&s;&s;i|on to conclude on the&s;e terms; but that we &s;hould inform the Lord Amba&s;&s;adour of their de&s;ires, and re&s;olution, and that we would return the next Day with his peremptory An&s;wer; not but we knew, that the In&s;tructions from his Maje&s;ty extended not &s;o far; but that we might have oc|ca&s;ion to leave matters, as it were in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and part fairly from them, at the pre&s;ent.

<P>Upon delivery of this Letter, it was conclu|ded, that the former Articles &s;hould &s;tand in force; only that difference about &s;earching our Ships &s;hould remain in &s;u&s;pence, and be &s;pecified, as not fully agreed on: How&s;oever they would &s;earch our Ships, and it &s;hould not be accounted a breach of our Capitulations, until the King &s;hould intimate his di&s;like thereof. And that when Notice &s;hould come from his Maje&s;ty to <HI>Algier,</HI> that he approved not thereof, then it &s;hould be lawful for both &s;ides to break into Acts of Ho&s;tility. This moderate cour&s;e we thought to be le&s;s prejudicial to us for the pre&s;ent, than an open, and &s;udden War: For by this means we gained the relea&s;ement of two &s;mall <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships which their Men carried in thither, and had time to give notice to our Merchants in all Ports and places, of the true &s;tate of our bu&s;i|ne&s;s with <HI>Algier.</HI></P>
<P>On the Twenty-&s;eventh of <HI>November,</HI> we de|parted from the bay of <HI>Algier</HI> with a pro&s;perous, and &s;teddy Gale, &s;teering N.E. and N.N.E. for <HI>Me&s;&s;ina,</HI> from whence we intended to di&s;patch Let|ters unto all places, rendring advices to his Ma|je&s;ty, and the Merchants, of the State and Condi|tion of our Affairs, and Negotiation at <HI>Algier:</HI> And whil&s;t we plea&s;antly &s;ail'd with a pro&s;perous wind, on a &s;udden a cry was made of Fire, in the Ship, which a&s;toni&s;hed us all with a great amazement. For the Cooper it &s;eems, going into the Steward's Room to &s;tave a Cask which formerly had &s;ome Brandy in it, by chance a Snuff of the Candle fell in at the bung, which put the whole Ve&s;&s;el into a Flame: But the &s;ame Man immedi|ately &s;topping the Bung, &s;oon &s;mothered the Fire, and therewith extingui&s;h'd thatand our fears.

<P>Some Days pa&s;&s;ed before we could get pra|tick; for having touched at <HI>Algier,</HI> a place al|ways &s;u&s;pected for the Plague, great &s;cruple was made of admitting us to free conver&s;e in the Town: Until the Lord Amba&s;&s;adour gave un|der his Hand and Seal an a&s;&s;urance of the Health of our Ship; on confidence of which we received Pratick, and the Palace called Paradi&s;e, where commonly the Vice-Kings are lodged, was ap|pointed to receive his Excellency and his Reti|nue, and the Furniture thereof ordered by <HI>D. Franci&s;co de la Villa Padierna,</HI> a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> who was <HI>Stratago,</HI> which is as much Commander in chief of all the Ca&s;tles and Forts in and about <HI>Me&s;&s;ina.</HI> So &s;oon as his Excellency landed, this <HI>Stratago</HI> made him a Vi&s;it, and at his departure left his Guard with him in a Complement, but in the mean time the <HI>Jurati,</HI> who were &s;ix in num|ber, cho&s;e (as I think) every year, or every third year by the Citizens for Government of the City, were wanting in the like civility towards our Am|ba&s;&s;ador; four of which are cho&s;en out of the Burgers, and two out of the Gentry, for they took no notice of him, nor &s;ent him any me&s;&s;age until the hour that he was about to depart, when his Excellency refu&s;ed to receive their vi&s;its, ex|cu&s;ing his neglect of attendance to matters of Ceremony, at a time when bu&s;ine&s;s urged his departure: whence this omi&s;&s;ion on the Jurats &s;ide proceeded, may in probability be deriv'd from the antipathy they have to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and their Government, always running contrary to that, un|to which they find the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ters mo&s;t in|clined. During our abode at this place his Excel|lency having returned his Vi&s;it to the <HI>Stratago,</HI> accompanied with <HI>D.

This extremity of weather made us think of &s;ome Port, or Harbour, wherein to &s;ecure our Ship. The I&s;land of <HI>Ip&s;era</HI> lying <HI>S. B. W.</HI> about eight Leagues from <HI>Mytilene,</HI> was judged by our Ma|&s;ter to be the mo&s;t convenient and &s;afe place, wherein we might &s;pend the fury of this &s;torm; wherefore putting before it with our Fore&s;ail, and our Main&s;ail in the Brailes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A miracu|lous e&s;|cape from &s;hipwrack</NOTE> the wind was &s;o forcible, that it carried away our Fore&s;ail like Paper from the Yard; and bringing another in the place thereof, it had the misfortune to be &s;oul of the &s;look of our Anchor, and &s;o became as un&s;erviceable as the former: being thus de|prived of the benefit of our commanding Sails, we &s;et our Sprit&s;ail, and Main-cour&s;e, and &s;o &s;teered in between the two I&s;les of <HI>Ip&s;era</HI> the greater; and the le&s;s. Being &s;hot with|in, and keeping as near aluff as we could to the &s;hore, we on a &s;udden &s;truck upon a Rock, which a&s;toni&s;hed us all with a &s;trange amaze|ment; the Ship fetched five Sallies, or Seeles upon it with &s;uch violence, that we expected to &s;ink immediately into the deep; and indeed if we con&s;ider the forciblene&s;s of the wind, the tur|gency of the Sea, and the weight of our burden, having four hundred per&s;ons aboard, and &s;ixty Guns mounted, it will appear little le&s;s than a Miracle, that the Ship brake not into more pie|ces than our numbers were aboard. I &s;tood then by the Mate, when he fathomed our depth of water by the Lead and Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">; and we had then &s;eventeen foot and a half by the &s;ide, but the Ship drawing eighteen foot, we began to fear a total ruin, and &s;hipwrack, and with ca&s;t-up eyes, and &s;tretched out arms, thought now of no other than of our la&s;t and ultimate Port. But in the mid&s;t of this horrid con&s;ternation and di&s;tre&s;s, it plea&s;ed God, who was our be&s;t Pilot, and gui|ded us to the edg of the Rock, to bring us clear of it; when we &s;oon e&s;pied &s;ome of our &s;heathing to &s;wim upon the Sea; and running down to the Well of our Pumps, we perceived a great in|crea&s;e of water, but not &s;o much but that Pum|ping once every half hour, we kept our Ship in a condition of &s;afety. Being thus by Gods Provi|dence come to a convenient place of Anchorage, being well furni&s;hed with ground-Tackle we rode for two days in a &s;tre&s;s of wind, with two Anchors a head, of which our &s;heet-Anchor was one, and with our Top-ma&s;ts and Yards &s;truck. Afterwards the wind abating &s;omething of its late fiercene&s;s, though continuing in the &s;ame quarter, we had opportunities to go a&s;hore and to make &s;ome Provi&s;ions of Wine, of which that I&s;land yields an admirable &s;ort, and as rich as any in the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> though the people are as poor, or rather more mi&s;erable than their Neighbours. In three or four days, by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ullage and weeds which the Leak had &s;ucked in, the wa|ter began to &s;top, and our Ship became &s;o per|fectly tight, that our Captain judged it not ne|ce&s;&s;ary to enquire, when we arrived at <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople,</HI> into the damage which we had received from the Rock; and the Ship afterwards by Gods Providence arriving &s;afe in the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> was brought into the Dock at <HI>Woolidg,</HI> where upon &s;earch was di&s;covered a great piece of the Rock, as big as a mans head, &s;truck into the bilge of the Ship, and &s;o firmly fixed, as if it had been riveted within; which &s;eemed &s;o &s;trange a thing, that hte Shipwrights before they would take it from thence, fir&s;t thought fit to acquaint the King thereof; who was plea&s;ed in per&s;on to go and &s;ee it; which appearing a &s;trange, and almo&s;t a miraculous accident, His Maje&s;ty com|manded it to be taken out, and (as I am infor|med) it is kept in his Clo&s;et.

<P>We rode here until the 14th day when be|tween one and two in the morning, the wind &s;prang out of the W.S.W. with an ea&s;ie gale, with which we weighed our Anchors, and put to Sea; the next morning early being the 15th day, we were up with the I&s;land of <HI>Tenedos,</HI> and towards Noon we entered the <HI>Helle&s;pont</HI> with a fre&s;h gale, which was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tem the &s;trength of the current; and about three a Clock we pa&s;&s;ed the Ca&s;tles of <HI>Se&s;tos</HI> and <HI>Abydos;</HI> from whence came off a boat with a Druggerman, and Janizaries, bringing Letters from Sir <HI>Thomas Bendi&s;h,</HI> then Amba&s;&s;ador at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> congratulating the Arrival of his Excellency, and &s;oon returned
<PB N="102" REF="55">again a&s;hoar to carry the news of our entrance within the Ca&s;tles.</P>
<P>On the Seventeenth Day about Noon, being ju&s;t Three months &s;ince the Lord Amba&s;&s;ador with his Family embarked, we came to an An|chor near the Seven Towers, from whence we gave notice to St. <HI>Thomas Bendy&s;h</HI> of our near ap|proach; and having given Two hours &s;pace for to carry the intelligence, we weighed our An|chors, and &s;tood in for the Port of <HI>Con&s;tantinople:</HI> At this time, a <HI>Bo&s;tangee,</HI> one belonging to the Grand Signior's Garden, came aboard, &s;ent by the <HI>Bo|&s;tangee</HI>-ba&s;hee or Head of the Gardeners, to di&s;|cover, and know what Ship it was of &s;uch Equi|page, and greatne&s;s; advi&s;ing us al&s;o, that the Grand Signior was &s;eated in a Chiosk or Summer|hou&s;e on the corner Wall of the <HI>Seraglio.</HI> Having thus our Anchor aboard with a fre&s;h and favou|rablegale, our Flags and En&s;igns di&s;played, and a Streamer at every Yard-arm, our Guns and Wa&s;t-clothes out; and being near the Wall of the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> the &s;ame <HI>Bo&s;tangee</HI> came again aboard, acquainting us, that it was the Grand Signior's plea&s;ure, that we &s;hould rejoyce with Guns, (which was his expre&s;&s;ion;) the Ship having her Sails &s;welled out with a gentle Gale, and the &s;wiftne&s;s of her motion retarded by the current, gave the Turks an opportunity to take a full pro&s;pect of her, the decks being full of men; we fired Sixty one Guns, as we pa&s;&s;ed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Salutation of the <HI>Se|raglio.</HI></NOTE> and with that order, that the Ve&s;&s;el could never appear with better advantage, had &s;he been de&s;cribed by the Hand of the mo&s;t skilful Painter: And thus we came to an Anchor on <HI>Toppennau</HI> &s;ide, where Sir <HI>Thomas Bendy&s;h</HI> came immediately aboard to congratulate the &s;afe arrival of this new Amba&s;|&s;ador: And now here it may be enquired, whe|ther the <HI>Seraglio</HI> returned any an&s;wer to this &s;a|lute by tho&s;e Guns which lye under the Garden|wall, of which mo&s;t, or all are di&s;mounted: I an&s;wer, not; for this having been the fir&s;t Man of War, or fir&s;t Royal &s;hip, that ever carried up an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador to <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> it having been the cu&s;tom formerly to have them tran|&s;ported thither on &s;ome goodly Merchant-&s;hip laden with the rich Commodities of our Coun|try, a return of Guns was never demanded, or expected; and perhaps it was a matter not then thought of; which if it had, and been required, it is probable, in that conjuncture (if ever) it would have been granted; both becau&s;e old <HI>Ku|perlee</HI> the Father, then governed, who was a great friend to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and Enemy to the <HI>French,</HI> who&s;e Amba&s;&s;ador was then under re&s;traint, would have in meer oppo&s;ition and hatred to them, be&s;towed tho&s;e honours on our Nation, which at another time could not have been ex|torted for a great Sum of Money; and &s;o much I collect from the very words of <HI>Kuperlee,</HI> who af|ter our Lord Amba&s;&s;ador had made his En|trance in a more &s;plendid manner than u&s;ual, as we &s;hall under&s;tand by the &s;equel, he demanded of our Chief Druggerman, how the <HI>French</HI> re&s;ent|ed this treatment? He an&s;wered, not well, but with an envious Eye, as he &s;uppo&s;ed; let them bur&s;t with malice, replied the Vizier. Of late years &s;ince the glory and greatne&s;s of <HI>France,</HI> their Amba&s;&s;adors have been always tran&s;ported up to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> in the Kings Ships. Mon&s;ieur <HI>la Haye</HI> the younger came on Man of War of the Kings, and a Fire&s;hip; Mon&s;eur <HI>de Nointel,</HI> with Two men of War and a Fire&s;hip; and now lately Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Guilleragues</HI> with no le&s;s an Equipage than the former. All which before they entered <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> made a &s;top about the Seven Towers, capitulating fir&s;t to have a re-&s;alute from the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> before they would pa&s;s their Complement to that place; which being de|nied, as a thing never practi&s;ed; the <HI>French</HI> Men of War have of late pa&s;&s;ed with &s;ilence, without giving, or receiving a &s;alute: How&s;oever, as things &s;tand now, I &s;hould &s;carce advi&s;e, that <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men of War &s;hould in&s;i&s;t upon the like, for we having once done it, a cu&s;tom may be pre|tended; and that may give a beginning to &s;uch a di&s;pute which a new Amba&s;&s;ador ought &s;tu|diou&s;ly to avoid, the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances of <HI>France</HI> not &s;uiting exactly with the &s;ole Intere&s;t of Trade which is exerci&s;ed by <HI>England.</HI></P>

<P>His Excellency being thus lodged at his Hou&s;e at <HI>Pera,</HI> he was immediately &s;aluted from the Em|perors Re&s;ident by his Secretary; and &s;oon after by Signor <HI>Padavino</HI> Secretary to their Excellen|cies <HI>Balarino</HI> and <HI>Capello,</HI> of whom we &s;hall here|after have occa&s;ion to name, being tho&s;e who negotiated the Affairs of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Republick.

This we mention particularly, becau&s;e it was a Gift anciently be|&s;towed in the times of the fir&s;t Amba&s;&s;adors; and though it had not been of late years pra|cti&s;ed, yet being found in the Old Regi&s;ters, the cu&s;tom was again revived, becau&s;e the <HI>Turks</HI>
<PB N="103" REF="55">were in an humour to gratifie, and &s;hew all the Honour they could to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;a|dor.</P>
<P>On the Twenty eighth of this Month of <HI>Janu|ary,</HI> his Excellency had his fir&s;t Audience of the Great Vizier;<NOTE PLACE="marg">His fir&s;t Audience with the Vizier.</NOTE> and being attended thither, ad met by the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Officers on <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> &s;ide, (in the &s;ame manner, as when he fir&s;t landed) he was conducted to the Viziers Palace; and be|ing held up under the Arm by Two of his Gen|tlemen (that being the fa&s;hion of great men among&s;t the <HI>Turks</HI>) he was introduced to the Pre&s;ence of the Vizier; who being aged and de|crepit, was &s;itting on Cu&s;hions in a little Room with a Fire, and his Feet covered, &s;everal Pa|&s;haws, Pages, and other Officers &s;tanding by him. His Excellency and Sir <HI>Thomas Bendy&s;h</HI> were &s;eated on Two Velvet &s;tools; where fir&s;t the Earl of <HI>Winchel&s;ea</HI> having pre&s;ented the King's Letters to the Vizier wrote in Parchment, and put into a Bag of Cloth of Gold; Sir <HI>Thomas Bendy&s;h</HI> began to inform the Vizier, that this was that honourable Per&s;on, of whom he had for|merly acquainted him, was coming to re&s;ide for Amba&s;&s;ador in his place: That he was of that Nobility, and relation to our King, that had not his Maje&s;ty intended highly, and in an extraor|dinary manner to Honour, and oblige the Grand Signior, he would not have expo&s;ed his Kin&s;man, and a Per&s;on extraordinary, to the hazard of a Voyage &s;o long and dangerous as this. Then the Earl of <HI>Winchel&s;ea</HI>-began to &s;peak, and relate the happy re&s;tauration of the King his Ma&s;ter to the Throne of his Ance&s;tors; extolling his Power, Greatne&s;s and Clemency in pardoning all, but &s;uch, who were engaged in the Blood of his Father. That in his pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople,</HI> he had by Command of the King touched at <HI>Algier,</HI> endeavouring to renew the former Articles of Peace, and relea&s;e an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Lord (meaning the Lord <HI>Obryan</HI>) taken Captive by them contrary to the Articles of Peace, but without &s;ucce&s;s, not being able to reduce them to any Terms of Rea&s;on, or Ju&s;tice: And enlarging in his Complements with a&s;&s;urances of the friend|&s;hip which the King his Ma&s;ter de&s;ired to con|&s;erve, and maintain with the Grand Signior, as a token thereof, he acquainted him, that he was the fir&s;t Amba&s;&s;ador &s;ent abroad by his Ma&s;ter, &s;ince his happy return, before he had de&s;igned, or appointed any to Chri&s;tian Princes. The Vizier readily an&s;wered: <HI>That it was but Rea&s;on it &s;hould be &s;o; &s;ince the Grand Signior was an Emperor, and they but Kings; and he the greate&s;t, and mo&s;t Sove|raign Potentate of the World: And that as to the Bu&s;ine&s;s of</HI> Algier, <HI>he would take care of it, and do him Ju&s;tice.</HI> This having pa&s;&s;ed, Two <HI>China</HI> di&s;hes with Sherbet were brought forth, and given to the Two Amba&s;&s;adors, and Two larger bowles of the &s;ame to their Attendants: Then the Pre|&s;ent was brought forth, and laid before the Vizier, con&s;i&s;ting of Twenty Ve&s;ts; Four of them were of fine <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloth of &s;everal colours; Four of &s;everal coloured Velvets; Fourof &s;everal flowred Stuffs with Gold and Silver; Four of watred Tabbies, and Four of Sattins: In recompence hereof both the Amba&s;&s;adors were ve&s;ted, with Six others, which Ve&s;ts are of no great matter of u&s;e, or value, more than that they are evidences and badges of the Vizier's favour. After this his Excellency with Sir <HI>Thomas Bendy&s;h</HI> aro&s;e, and de|parted, wearing the&s;e Ve&s;ts, until they were pa&s;&s;ed without the Gates of the Viziers Palace, and then they delivered them to be carried by their Servants, as the others did; and &s;o his Ex|cellency returned to his Hou&s;e at <HI>Pera,</HI> with an appearance of a fair Corre&s;pondency, and with a&s;&s;urances that the Capitulations and friend|&s;hip &s;hould be maintained, and con&s;erved with a &s;trict and inviolate Faith.</P>
<P>The day of giving pay to the Jani&s;aries draw|ing near, the Amba&s;&s;ador's Audience with the Grand Signior was deferred until that time, for with that occa&s;ion the Court would appear in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, and the attendance of the Soldiery would render all things more great and powerful: In the mean time the Grand Sig|nior often took a view from his <HI>Seraglio,</HI> of the <HI>Plymouth</HI> Frigat, and frequently rowed round her in a Boat; and &s;ome &s;ay, he once came <HI>In|cognito</HI> aboard to &s;ee her; at length he was &s;o plea&s;ed with her, that he fancied her to be a very proper Ve&s;&s;el to carry Soldiers and Ammuni|tion for <HI>Candia;</HI> but propo&s;ing his Thoughts and intentions to the Vizier, he was di&s;&s;waded from the demand, or con&s;traint of the Ship, being ad|moni&s;hed, that this was a matter unpracticable, and uncivil towards a Prince, who on confidence of Amity and Alliance with him, had adventu|red his Ship within his Port.</P>
<P>The Twenty &s;ixth day of <HI>February,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Audience with the Grand Signior.</NOTE> being Pay-day of the Jani&s;aries, the Lord Amba&s;&s;ador had Audience of the Grand Signior, which was per|formed in this manner. His Excellency, with Sir <HI>Thomas Bendy&s;h,</HI> departing from his Hou&s;e, with his retinue on Hor&s;e-back, by break of day in the Morning, was met on <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> &s;ide by the Chaous-Ba&s;hee, and his Chaou&s;es, and by them conducted to the <HI>Seraglio.</HI> We rode through the fir&s;t Court which was very &s;pacious, and then we alighted from our Hor&s;es, and walked through another Court leading to the Divan, or place of Judicature; at the upper end of which the Great Vizier was &s;eated; on his right Hand &s;ate Five Viziers of the Bench, of which the Captain-Pa|&s;ha, or Admiral of the Seas, was one; on the left were the Two Kadile&s;chers or Chief Ju&s;tices, one of <HI>Anatolia,</HI> and the other of <HI>Romelia,</HI> and by them the Tefterdar Pa&s;ha or Lord Trea&s;urer, with Three other Pa&s;ha's: The floar of the Divan was covered with Carpets, and on them a richer covering of Bags of Money, for payment of the Janisaries. The Two Amba&s;&s;adors with about Six or Seven of their retinue (among&s;t which I was one) being admitted in, and placed at the lower end, their Excellencies approached toward the Vizier, and were &s;eated near unto him on Two &s;tools co|vered with Crim&s;on Velvet, and &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e and Complement having pa&s;&s;ed between them, they retired to another part of the Room, that they might give way to Bu&s;ine&s;s. In the mean time the payment of the Soldiers went forward, every Churbagee, or Captain, taking from the heaps, the Pay of his Soldiers, and laying the Bags on their Shoulders, made up to the Vi|zier, and having ki&s;&s;ed the Hem of his Ve&s;t on his Knees, he retired with great Humility and ha&s;t from him, pa&s;&s;ing away with his &s;ide towards him, it being very un&s;eemly among&s;t them to turn their backs to Per&s;onages of that Dignity.</P>
<P>The Payment being over, Three &s;mall Tables were brought in; the fir&s;t of which was covered with a silver Voyder, at which the Two Amba&s;|&s;adors &s;ate with the chief Mini&s;ters; but the Great Vizier by rea&s;on of his Age and Weakne&s;s retired into another Room. The other Two Tables were covered with a mixed Mettal, which &s;erved in the place of a Table-Cloth, at which the others &s;ate: We had no Knives, Forks, nor Plate; but only Wooden Spoons were laid for us, which was &s;ufficient in that manner of eating, for their Meats are mo&s;t boyled, and conveniently received by the Spoon; or are &s;o well roa&s;ted, that they are ea&s;ily parted with the Fingers. The
<PB N="104" REF="56">di&s;hes were &s;erved in by one at a time, but &s;o fa&s;t, that we had &s;carce ta&s;ted of one, before it was &s;natched away to make place for another; and I think there might be about Twenty &s;everal changes, in this manner; at the end of all, to con|clude our Fea&s;t, a great Bowl of Sherbet was brought in, and we drank of it, as large draughts as we plea&s;ed. Being ri&s;en from the Table, Eighteen Coftans, or Ve&s;ts, being the u&s;ual num|ber given to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;adour, with one extraordinary in favour to the New Amba&s;&s;ador, were brought forth, and be&s;towed; and in the mean time, the Pre&s;ent from our King to the Grand Signior, provided at the expence of the <HI>Turky</HI> Company, con&s;i&s;ting of Fifty Ve&s;ts, <HI>viz.</HI> Ten of Velvet, Ten of Sattin, Ten of Cloth of Gold, Ten of Tabbies, and Ten of fine <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloth, were brought forth and di&s;played in the open Court by Fifty men which carried them, and Four <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ma&s;tiffs, which were more ac|ceptable to this Grand Signoir than all the re&s;t. The whole body of Jani&s;aries then payed, con|&s;i&s;ting of about Five thou&s;and, were drawn up in a body, and ranged on one &s;ide of the Court|yard; among&s;t them there was that &s;ilence, that the lea&s;t whi&s;per, noi&s;e, or motion was not heard; and as their Jani&s;ar Aga, and other Commanders pa&s;&s;ed, the bowings they made in &s;alute were &s;o regular, and at the &s;ame time, as may well te&s;tify the exactne&s;s of their Di&s;cipline, and ad|mirable obedience, which hath in a great mea&s;ure contributed towards their Conque&s;ts and Enlarge|ment of their Empire.</P>
<P>Being thus Ve&s;ted, and ranked in Order, the Great Vizier entered into the Pre&s;ence of the Grand Signior; and then Two Capugi-ba&s;hes or Chief of the Porters of the Gate, with long Silver Staves, took the New Amba&s;&s;ador under each Arm to conduct him to the Chamber of Au|dience; tho&s;e permitted to accompany him were Sir <HI>Thomas Bendy&s;h,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Winchel&s;ea</HI>'s Bro|ther, Sir <HI>Thomas Allen</HI> Captain of the <HI>Plymouth</HI> Frigat, the Interpreter, and my &s;elf, who then being Secretary, carried the Credential Letters made up in a Pur&s;e of Cloth of Gold. We gent|ly knocked at the fir&s;t Gate, which was imme|diately &s;et wide open to us, in the Porch where|of Forty white Eunuchs attended, clothed in Ve&s;ts of Sattin, and Cloth of Gold of divers co|lours, and &s;tood with their Hands before them with marvellous &s;ilence, and mode&s;ty. Coming near to the Pre&s;ence-door, where the Kapi-Aga or Chief of the white Eunuchs attended, we made a pau&s;e in the Porch, and trod very &s;oftly, &s;o as not to di&s;turb with the lea&s;t motion, the greatne&s;s of that Maje&s;ty; and &s;o profound was the &s;ilence, that nothing was heard be&s;ides the murmurings of a Fountain adjoining hereunto. Ju&s;t at the entrance of the Chamber, hung a gilded Ball &s;tudded with divers precious Stones, the Floar was covered with Crim&s;on Velvet; em|broidered with Golden-wyre. The Grand Sig|nior him&s;elf &s;ate in a Throne rai&s;ed a &s;mall heigth from the ground, &s;upported with Four Pillars plated with Gold; from the top hung &s;everal gilded Balls twined with Ma&s;&s;es of Pearl; the Cu&s;hions he &s;ate upon, and tho&s;e al&s;o that lay by, were richly embroidered, and be&s;et with Jewels, and on his right hand &s;tood the Great Vizier. And having made a con&s;iderable &s;top at the Door, the Two Capugiba&s;hees, who held his Excel|lence under each Arm, brought him to the mid|dle of the Room, and laying their Hands upon his Head, made him bow, until he touched the Carpets with his forehead; and then rai&s;ing him again, they retired backward with him, un|to the farthe&s;t part of the Room; and in like man|ner they took all the others &s;ingly and in order, placing them behind the Amba&s;&s;adors. The Creden|tial Letters from our King were then pre&s;ented, and appointed that they &s;hould be delivered to the hands of the <HI>Reis-Efendi,</HI> or Secretary of State.</P>
<P>Then the Druggerman or Interpreter, by Or|der of the Lord Amba&s;&s;ador, read a Paper in the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Language to this Effect.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Declaring how the King of Great <HI>Bri|tain</HI> our Soveraign Lord and Ma&s;ter, was re&s;tored to the Throne of his Ance&s;tors without War, or any Conditions: And the great Clemency of His Maje&s;ty in pardoning all, but tho&s;e who had a hand in the Murder of his Father.</P>
<P>Secondly, Recommending the Merchants and their Intere&s;t to the continuance of his u&s;ual Fa|vour and Protection.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Begging the freedom of all <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Slaves, as a particular Te&s;timony of Favour, and Grace to this New Amba&s;&s;ador.</P>
<P>The&s;e Ceremonies being performed, and the Paper read, we immediately departed, pa&s;&s;ing to our Hor&s;es by the &s;ame way which we came: And being mounted, we drew up a little out of the pa&s;&s;age to &s;ee the Soldiers march by us, which indeed appeared to be a very flouri&s;hing Militia of young Men, robu&s;t, and well clothed; many of them running with Bags of Money on their Shoulders, and all of them chearful, and glad of the charge they carried with them; after them followed their Commanders exceedingly well mounted: And la&s;t of all came the Great Vizier attended with many Pa&s;haes, and a goodly Equipage: And then his Excellency, with Sir <HI>Tho|mas Bendy&s;h,</HI> and attendance, proceeded forwards, and returned to their home. After this Two vi&s;its were made: Namely, to the Captain-Pa&s;ha or Admiral of the Seas, and the other to the Mu&s;tee; at the fir&s;t, Six Ve&s;ts were pre&s;ented; and at the latter, Five; and both were perform|ed, and accepted with &s;uch mutual kindne&s;s, that never did the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ters ca&s;t more &s;erene countenances on the Trade and Concernments of <HI>England,</HI> than on this conjuncture.</P>
<P>And thus the Earl of <HI>Winchel&s;ea</HI> being very &s;uc|ce&s;sfully, and with fignal Demon&s;trations of Ho|nour, and a good corre&s;pondence, &s;eated in the u&s;ual re&s;idence of Amba&s;&s;adors, the Grand Signior, as a particular Note and mark of his favour pre|&s;ented him with Three <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Slaves, and re|turned a kind and friendly an&s;wer to his Maje|&s;ties Letters, by Sir <HI>Thomas Bendy&s;h,</HI> who embark|ed on the <HI>Plimouth</HI> Frigat, and departed the Ele|venth of <HI>March.</HI> And thus having given the Rea|der a Relation of the State of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> concern|ments in <HI>Turky:</HI> Let us view and con&s;ider the Condition of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Affairs among&s;t them&s;elves.</P>
<P>At the arrival of this Amba&s;&s;ador, the im|portant affairs of this va&s;t and &s;till growing Em|pire, were governed by the Great Vizier <HI>Ku|perlee;</HI> a Per&s;on decrepit and infirm in body, by rea&s;on of his great Age, but of a &s;olid and &s;ubtle judgment; by Nature cruel, and by Years fro|ward; which di&s;po&s;ition was &s;ingularly well fit|ted to do &s;ervice to his Ma&s;ter, again&s;t the im|petuous &s;torms of the Faction of tho&s;e times, in which the Pa&s;haws, and Chiefs of the Soldiery (as often it happens in Empires, who&s;e Body is grown too va&s;t to be ruled by a weak Head) became rich and powerful, and by the long Va|cations of Peace, in&s;olent and wanton; for as then the Wars with <HI>Venice</HI> were carried on faintly, only by &s;ending forth an Armata of Gallies in the Spring; and the preparations became rather ac|cu&s;tomary, returning with the Year, and made

So that to encounter &s;o many difficul|ties, and predominancy of Ambition and Avarice, the Prince him&s;elf being young, the Fortune of his Empire had more than urgent nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a rough and cruel di&s;po&s;ition as was found in <HI>Kuperlee;</HI> who &s;o &s;ea&s;onably made u&s;e of it, to the de&s;truction of all &s;uch, who might either endanger his Prince, or him&s;elf; that in two or three Years time he became Ma&s;ter of the Lives and E&s;tates of the Grand Mutiniers; confi&s;ca|ting their riche&s;s and fortunes to the u&s;e and &s;e|curity of his Ma&s;ter; having in his time put to Death thirty &s;ix thou&s;and per&s;ons, whom he pro&s;cribed in &s;everal Countries, and privately &s;trangled in the City, by vertue of his ab&s;olute and uncontroulable Authority, without giving the Offenders liberty of Proce&s;&s;es, or Pleas for their Lives, or the &s;olemnity of Scaffolds, or ap|plau&s;e of a Funeral Oration at the Gallows, whereby to win the affections and compa&s;&s;ions of the vulgar, but went through with his bloody and tragical bu&s;ine&s;s, without noi&s;e, or rumour, or knowledge almo&s;t of the Souldiery, or the people; whil&s;t the great Per&s;onages, who&s;e ra|pine and pride had contracted them envy and hatred from their inferiours, &s;tood confu&s;ed and ama&s;ed, not having power to rebel, nor San|ctuary to fly unto.</P>
<P>Such is the effect of an ab&s;olute, and arbitrary power, which is Ma&s;ter of times and affairs, and rather fits and &s;quares Enterprizes to Coun&s;els, than Coun&s;els to Enterprizes. <HI>Reges Hercule non liberi &s;olum impedimentis omnibus, &s;ed Domini re|rum, temporun&abque; trahunt Con&s;iliis cuncta, non &s;e|quuntur.

The Grand Signior in the mean time applauded the diligence and circum|&s;pection of his Mini&s;ter; and though yet trem|bling with the memory of late &s;ollevations a|mong&s;t the Janizaries; yet being young, and active, addicted him&s;elf wholly to the delight of Hunting, and to follow the Chace of fearful, and flying Bea&s;ts; whil&s;t his Vizier &s;o clo&s;ely fol|low'd his game of Bloud, that he left no Per&s;on con|&s;iderable in the Empire, who was not a Creature made by, or depending on him; unle&s;s the Ka|hyabei, or Lieutenant General of the Janizaries; <HI>Mortaza</HI> Pa&s;ha of <HI>Babylon,</HI> now called by the <HI>Turks Bagdat,</HI> and the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Magna&s;ia;</HI> Men, who&s;e bravery, and generous Ju&s;tice, or el&s;e their Guards, or Fortune, had only &s;eated beyond the reach and Sword of this Tyrant.

This <HI>Ragotski</HI> enjoyed a State mo&s;t happy, large, fertile, and populous, in Power inferior to few, &s;uperior to many; &s;o that he might have pa&s;&s;ed peaceably and honourably with all, could his great &s;pirit have bowed to, and complied with his Potent Neighbours.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The diffi|culty of <HI>Ragotski</HI>'s Affairs.</NOTE> For on the one &s;ide the Pui&s;|&s;ant power of the <HI>Turk</HI> threatned him, to whom the lea&s;t Ombrages of di&s;plea&s;ure admini&s;ter oc|ca&s;ion of War; On the &s;ide of <HI>Hungary</HI> the Em|perour over-awed him: On the &s;ide of <HI>Valachia,</HI> and <HI>Moldavia</HI> he lay open to the incur&s;ion of the <HI>Tartars.</HI> So that a man might rationally expect, That this Prince &s;hould have e&s;teemed it honour enough to have con&s;erved his own without ren|dring him&s;elf obnoxious to the jealou&s;ie and &s;u|&s;picion of his Neighbours.

<P>But how vain and deceitful are humane hopes, who&s;e foundations are Ambition and Violence!

<P><HI>Ragotski</HI> being well informed what was de&s;ign|ing again&s;t him at the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Port; and know|ing that his power was not able to oppo&s;e &s;o much pui&s;&s;ance, re&s;olved to give way to nece&s;|&s;ity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He depo|&s;es him|&s;elf.</NOTE> and voluntarily depo&s;e him&s;elf, before he &s;hould be engaged thereunto by the Imperial Decree; &s;o that he calmly receded from his Prin|cipality, hoping that his humility and &s;ubmi&s;&s;i|on might procure his pardon at the Court.

It is uncertain whether <HI>Berclay</HI> de&s;igned the Principality to him&s;elf by any in&s;tance he made to the <HI>Turks,</HI> or whether his Election proceeded meerly from the Vizier him&s;elf; yet this is cer|tain, that returning home, <HI>Berclay</HI> applied him|&s;elf to e&s;tabli&s;h his own Dominion, and to di&s;|appoint the de&s;igns of his Predece&s;&s;or, and his party.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> being &s;atisfied with this Submi&s;&s;ion, with the Subjection of &s;everal places of Impor|tance, with depo&s;ing of <HI>Ragotzki,</HI> and e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of a new Prince, began to disband a great part of their Forces; and the Great Vizier, with the remainder, returned towards <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing the Fire of this War to be totally extin|gui&s;hed.</P>
<P>In this condition of Repo&s;e, matters continued for about the &s;pace of two Years, when <HI>Ragotz|ki</HI> impatient of his lo&s;&s;es, and of the exchange of his publick State to a private Condition, invete|rate in his hate towards his Rival and Competi|tor, re&s;olved to tempt Fortune once more, and make his ultimate A&s;&s;ay, either to e&s;tabli&s;h him|&s;elf in his Principality, or at lea&s;t to render him|&s;elf equal with other mortal Princes in the Grave; and &s;o relying with much Confidence on the zea|lous Affection of his Subjects, and the promi&s;e of powerful Adherents,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ragotki</HI> makes new Troubles.</NOTE> he once again ju&s;tled him|&s;elf into the Government, by the Expul&s;ion of his Rival; whom he could not behold with other than with an emulous and unplea&s;ing Eye. <HI>Berclay</HI> perceiving him&s;elf thus en&s;nared, neglected, and per&s;ecuted by all Parties, repre&s;ented the&s;e Inno|vations to the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Port, with the mo&s;t ag|gravating Circum&s;tances imaginable; be&s;eeching them to afford him aid, and vindicate their own Honour in maintenance of him, whom they had con&s;tituted a Prince, and was a Creature formed by their own favour. The <HI>Turks</HI> immediately touched with the Sen&s;e hereof, I&s;&s;ued out Orders to <HI>Ciddi Ahmet,</HI> the new Pa&s;ha of <HI>Buda;</HI> Com|manded him without delay, to gather what Forces he could to interrupt the de&s;igns of <HI>Tran|&s;ilvania;</HI> and to put matters unto a &s;tand, until a greater Army could &s;econd him, under the Com|mand of <HI>Ali</HI> Pa&s;ha, appointed General for this Expedition. The Pa&s;ha of <HI>Buda</HI> readily obeyed, and a&s;&s;embling what Forces he could in <HI>Hungary,</HI> and joining with the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Temi&s;war,</HI> pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Danube,</HI> and with a very con&s;iderable Army entered <HI>Tran&s;ivania. Ragotzki</HI> undaunted at the near approach of his Enemy, boldly entered the Field with his Forces, and joined Battel with them in the Month of <HI>May,</HI> 1660. between the Cities of <HI>Clau&s;enburg,</HI> and <HI>Giulia Alba.</HI> At fir&s;t the Chri&s;tians endeavoured to have intercepted the Enemies pa&s;&s;age, by &s;ome Ambu&s;cado or Strata|gem of War; but the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;till advancing, were at length met by the Van-guard of the Chri|&s;tians; to a&s;&s;i&s;tance of which &s;everal Bodies fol|lowing one after the other, it became a general Engagement of both Armies; in which Battel,
<PB N="108" REF="58"><HI>Ragotzki</HI> gave his u&s;ual proofs of Valour; de|claring by his Actions, that he was re&s;olved to dye, or to Triumph.

<P>After the Death of <HI>Ragotzki,</HI> it might well be expected that the&s;e Storms of War &s;hould be di|&s;per&s;ed, and that <HI>Tran&s;ilvania</HI> &s;hould at length enjoy the Sun-&s;hine, and calmer Weather of Peace and Repo&s;e.

<P>The Inhabitants of <HI>Varadin</HI> terrified at the ap|proach of this formidable Enemy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Peo|ple of <HI>Va|radin</HI> crave aid of the Emperor.</NOTE> di&s;patched a Me&s;&s;enger to the Emperor, imploring with mo&s;t effectual Arguments his Sacred Protection and powerful A&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the common Ene|my to <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> repre&s;enting to his Ce&s;are|an Maje&s;ty, how that the <HI>Turks</HI> in their Capitu|lations with him, had agreed to Build or Erect no new Fort on tho&s;e Frontiers: and whereas it was the &s;ame thing to force and u&s;urp a Fortre&s;s already made, as to form a new one; the taking of <HI>Varadin</HI> was to be e&s;teemed a real Violation of the Articles of Peace.

<PB N="109" REF="58">
<P><HI>Varadin</HI> therefore is &s;eated in a Plain, on the Banks of the River <HI>Chry&s;e;</HI> to the Ea&s;t it is envi|roned with &s;uch craggy and rough Mountains, as render it almo&s;t on that &s;ide unacce&s;&s;ible; to the South the Town extended it &s;elf mo&s;t; to the North it is wa&s;hed with the River, over which &s;ome &s;mall, yet fruitful, Hills rai&s;e them&s;elves; it is encompa&s;&s;ed with a Wall filled with Earth, after the fa&s;hion of Modern Fortifications, and &s;trengthened with five main Bulwarks, and a very deep Ditch filled with the River Water: It was well provided both of Victuals and Ammunition, and armed with Ordnance both great and &s;mall, as was &s;ufficient to have repul&s;ed a pui&s;&s;ant Enemy, &amp; have &s;u&s;tain'd a long &amp; &s;trait Siege. But the Gari|&s;on within con&s;i&s;ted only of 850 Soldiers, an incon&s;i|derable number, both in re&s;pect of the Circuit of the Fortre&s;s, &amp; of that gro&s;s Army which encompa&s;s'd it.</P>
<P>The Enemy being now, as it is &s;aid before, un|der the Counter&s;carp of the Wall, they perceived that the Ditch was &s;o deep, and filled with Wa|ter, that though their great Guns had made open Breaches in the Walls, yet there was no po&s;&s;ibi|lity to &s;torm them, or bring the Soldiery to &s;caling Ladders, or handy blows. The be&s;ieged al&s;o made &s;uch continued Sallies, with &s;ucce&s;s and &s;laughter of the Enemy, that after Three and Twenty days of vain labour to few the Ditch, <HI>Ali</HI> Pa&s;ha was at length almo&s;t re&s;olved to have rai&s;ed his Siege, and given over the Enterprize; upon which whil&s;t he con&s;idered and ruminated (as ill Fortune would have it) a certain Maid, which formerly had been a &s;ervant to the Governour of the Gari&s;on, then a Captive in the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Camp, having ob&s;erved how on occa&s;ion the Citizens u&s;ed to empty and drain the Ditch, revealed the &s;ecret to the <HI>Turks,</HI> hoping thereby not only to purcha&s;e her Liberty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two ill accidents to the Gari&s;on.</NOTE> but with that al&s;o a Sum of Money for price of her Treachery; &s;o that di&s;|covering where another Ditch was to be opened, the cour&s;e of the Water was &s;oon diverted, and the Walls of the Town laid dry and open to the A&s;&s;ailants. As this happened without, &s;o another accident within, equally dangerous, befel the Be|&s;ieged; for one day an Officer of the Ammunition going into the Stores with a lighted Candle, by chance dropped a &s;park of fire from his Lanthorn into the Powder, which taking fire, blew up the Powder, Granadoes, Fire-works, and all other military Stores, with the neighbouring hou&s;es, and above a hundred men; which lo&s;s alone was &s;ufficient to have dejected the minds of frail men; yet they &s;o valiantly bore up their courages, that they &s;eemed not in the lea&s;t abated, but rather animated with the height of anger and de&s;pair. The <HI>Turks</HI> having now free acce&s;s to the Walls, undermined &s;ome &s;mall Forts, which they blew up, and thereby made &s;o great a Breach, that with facility hoping to gain the Town, if they made u&s;e of the occa&s;ion, they poured in &s;uch multi|tudes of People as the Be&s;ieged were &s;carce able to with&s;tand; and the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Soldiery being al|&s;o weary of their &s;ufferings, and irk&s;omne&s;s of their tedious leagure, re&s;olved now or never to put an end to their labours; &s;o that advancing with their open Brea&s;ts to the top of the Battle|ments, without fear either of Cannon, or Musket|&s;hot, they entered within the Walls, and planted the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Banners on the Works; but being af|terwards received by a re&s;olute Company of the Defendants, they were again thrown from the Walls, and tumbled back into the Ditch with an incredible Slaughter. It is impo&s;&s;ible here to de|&s;cribe the anger, the courage, the de&s;pair which was apparent in the faces of the Be&s;ieged, enfla|med by the love of their own country, and ha|tred of the <HI>Turks;</HI> &s;o that three or four &s;u&s;tained &s;ometimes the A&s;&s;ault of a Troop; and a &s;mall number united, oppo&s;ed a whole Sangiack of the Enemy. The Women al&s;o forgetting the imbe|cillity of their Sex, renewing in them&s;elves the Courage and Vigour of the Ancient Amazons, expo&s;ed them&s;elves without fear upon the Walls, throwing &s;calding Water, Stones, burning Pitch, and what&s;oever came next to hand, upon the A&s;&s;ai|lants; whom they &s;o valiantly repul&s;ed from the ri&s;ing of the Sun till twelve at Noon, that after much &s;laughter on both &s;ides, the <HI>Turks</HI> growing faint, retreated, and took breath a while within their Trenches. And now the Soldiery con&s;i|dering the Ob&s;tinacy of the Chri&s;tians, began to mutiny, and re&s;olving not to ca&s;t away their lives in vain, motioned to rai&s;e the Siege, and be gone; which when the General oppo&s;ed, they threat|ned to &s;acrifice his Life to the Gho&s;ts of their de|parted Brethren. But &s;ee, how many times the Devil ruines the fortune of the Chri&s;tians! for whil&s;t they were in this deliberation to depart, behold, a certain, <HI>Thracian</HI> one of the Gari&s;on Soldiers, advis'd the <HI>Turks</HI> that there were not above Three hundred found Men remaining in the whole Gari&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A <HI>Thra|cian</HI> be|trays the weakne&s;s of the Town.</NOTE> that they were now reduced to their ulti|mate <HI>Cri&s;is;</HI> &s;o that if they appear'd only before them, and would but terrifie them with another a&s;&s;ault, the Town was their own, without the lea&s;t doubt of Surrender. This advice retarded the ha&s;ty depar|ture of the Camp; in&s;tead of which they again mu|&s;ter'd them&s;elves before the Walls, and prepar'd to a&s;&s;ault the Breach, re&s;olving to put all to a &s;e|cond extremity. The Chri&s;tians within percei|ving the re&s;olution of their Enemy, and being &s;en|&s;ible how much they were infeebled by the la&s;t Convul&s;ion, and lo&s;s of blood, and as yet &s;ore of their wounds, immediately &s;pread a white Flag of Treaty, which was as readily accepted by the <HI>Turks,</HI> and all Articles agreed on the <HI>17th.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Varadin</HI> &s;urren|dred.</NOTE> of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> and on the <HI>20th.</HI> the Gari&s;on marched freely out with Colours flying, and Drums beat|ing, with liberty to go where&s;oever they plea&s;ed, without hurt or injury; which Conditions were fully and faithfully performed and maintained.</P>

<P><HI>Ali</HI> the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> General perceiving the &s;trength and re&s;olution of the Chri&s;tians, thought it pru|dence for a while to detract from Engagement, and temper the u&s;ual mettle of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> fury with cooler Coun&s;els of advantage, which delays and opportunities of time would admini&s;ter: for ob&s;erving that the <HI>Tran&s;ilvanians</HI> were divided into Factions, he humoured the di&s;&s;enting party,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> Po|licy.</NOTE> by con&s;tituting <HI>Michael Apafi</HI> their Prince; a per&s;on in the flower and &s;trength of his Age, of great parts and abilities; and one who violently

<P>How&s;oever <HI>Kemenius</HI> could not here re&s;t &s;atisfi|ed, but revolving in his mind certain ways to re|cover his Principality, obtained from <HI>Montecu|culi</HI> &s;ome <HI>German</HI> Troops; with which, and with his own &s;cattered Forces, which at length he had collected into a Body, he re&s;olved to try his For|tune once more with the <HI>Turks;</HI> and joining Bat|tel with them, not far from <HI>Presburg,</HI> he fought with a re&s;olution becoming the de&s;peratene&s;s of his de&s;ign; either that day to Die, or to Triumph. The Fortune of that days conflict remained a long time doubtful; &s;o equal they &s;eemed on both &s;ides to be in their Courage, in their Force, and in their Conduct, until at length the advan|tage of the <HI>Turks</HI> number prevailing, <HI>Kemenius</HI> was forced to a di&s;orderly retreat,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Kemenius</HI> a &s;econd put time to flight</NOTE> and afterwards to a confu&s;ed flight; in which, being by one of his own Soldiers knocked from his Hor&s;e was trampled un|der foot, &amp; the greate&s;t part of his People remain'd a Sacrifice to the enraged Weapons of the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Apafi</HI>'s party being greatly encouraged with this &s;ucce&s;s, joining with a body of the <HI>Turks,</HI> laid Siege to <HI>Claudiopolis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Claudiopo|lis</HI> be&s;ieg|ed.</NOTE> the Court of the <HI>Tran|&s;ilvanian</HI> Princes, now Gari&s;oned by <HI>German</HI> Sol|diers, and Governed by <HI>David Retani,</HI> a right valiant and tru&s;ty Soldier, who omitting nothing which might conduce to the defence and mainte|nance of the Town, either by his care or valour, made many &s;ucce&s;sful Sallies upon the Enemy, and tired and wearied them out in their Siege; until at length General <HI>Schenidau</HI> then in <HI>Hungary,</HI> gathering what force he could, which were not above 6000 Men, marched with all ha&s;te po&s;&s;ible to the relief of <HI>Claudiopolis;</HI> the report of who&s;e approach arriving the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Camp before his Per&s;on, or Army, and the common rumour and fear augmenting much their number; the <HI>Turks</HI> were &s;o terrifyed hereat, that in ha&s;te and di&s;order they for&s;ook their Siege after three Months continu|ance; leaving great quantities of Victuals behind for want of Carriages, and Bea&s;ts of burden. <HI>Sche|nidau</HI> having gained this &s;ucce&s;s and honour with &s;o much facility, he reinforced the Gari&s;on, and returned with Triumph home;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Siege rai&s;ed.</NOTE> carrying with him great Booties of Cattle and other &s;poils of the Enemy.

<P><HI>Claudiopolis</HI> being thus relieved, the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;to|mached inwardly the di&s;grace, and yet thought it prudence for the pre&s;ent to di&s;&s;emble; and therefore upon &s;ome addre&s;&s;es made for Peace from <HI>Tran&s;ilvania,</HI> and certain Propo&s;itions tender|ed by the <HI>German</HI> Re&s;ident; the Vizier coumer|feited his inclinations thereunto &s;o far, that he prohibited all farther Acts of Ho&s;tility upon the Frontiers.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding which, the rumour at this time running, of a Combination of all Chri&s;ten|dom again&s;t the <HI>Turk,</HI> with Men or Money,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> jealou&s;y.</NOTE> for|warded by the endeavours of the Pope, and the contrivances of <HI>Venice,</HI> encrea&s;ed the former jea|lou&s;y, and cau&s;ed the Skirmi&s;hes on the Fron|tiers to be more hot and frequent: And the Vi|zier being froward and cholerick, and by nature jealous; matters had immediately proceeded to an open rupture, had not the <HI>German</HI> Pe&s;ident, by his Moderation and Prudence, repre&s;ented af|fairs in the &s;moothe&s;t gui&s;e of Peace, and de|layed the War rather than compo&s;ed it; &s;o that this whole Summer was &s;pent in di&s;putes, me&s;|&s;ages, and debates on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>The Vizier de&s;igning this War in his Eye, and de&s;irous to comply with the vagrant humour of his Ma&s;ter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Tur|ki&s;h</HI> Court removes to <HI>Adria|nople.</HI></NOTE> who was weary of his <HI>Seraglio</HI> at <HI>Con|&s;tantinople,</HI> re&s;olved to transfer the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Court to <HI>Adrianople,</HI> &s;o that toward the end of <HI>June</HI> they entered their Tents without the City.

<P>The time of this great Mortality was no &s;ea|&s;on for us to move in bu&s;ine&s;s or action, we and all other Chri&s;tians avoiding common conver&s;ati|on, every one con&s;ulting his particular &s;afety. How&s;oever two bu&s;ine&s;&s;es brought our Lord Am|ba&s;&s;ador to Town from his Country Retirement. One was to obtain ju&s;tice from the Vizier, on two mi&s;creant <HI>Turks</HI> who had committed a Robbery on his Page and Steward, as they were drinking at a Fountain near a place called <HI>Baucha&s;arai,</HI> a Village inhabited by <HI>Greeks;</HI> the Steward by the &s;wiftne&s;s of his Hor&s;e e&s;caped, but the Page being &s;ickly and weak fell into their hands, and was grievou&s;ly wounded by them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The G.

It is incredible with what diligence, &s;e|verity, and violence this command was executed, the people in the Villages where they had lodged or been, or but pa&s;&s;ed through, were all &s;eized; and the men examined under the Cudgel, with Drubs on their feet; the men, women, and chil|dren of <HI>Baucha-&s;arai</HI> were carried, and &s;ome of them in Chains, to our Amba&s;&s;adors Hou&s;e at <HI>Pera;</HI> and all the Countries round were &s;o ill treated, that their common &s;afety was concerned in the taking of the&s;e Thieves, and the allarum was by this time &s;o far &s;pread, that it was more pre&s;&s;ing and urgent than our <HI>Hue-and-Cry;</HI> in &s;hort, one of the Thieves was taken, and he di&s;covered the abode of his Companion, and both were brought to our Amba&s;&s;adors Hou&s;e, and there put into the Stocks, laden with Chains, and guarded by the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Officers. The next day they were carried before the <HI>Stambol-Efendi,</HI> or Recorder of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> they confe&s;&s;ed the fact, and Hoget or Sentence pa&s;&s;ed upon them, which by Law could reach no farther than to the Gallies; but being brought before the Vizier, he had a mind to &s;tretch the Law, and their necks to a farther ex|tent, and &s;o without other demur calling the Hang man, ordered him to put Ropes about their necks, and to carry them to the Lord Amba&s;&s;ador, following his directions for their execution; and &s;o accordingly one was hanged by the Fountain, and the other on a Tree at the entrance into the Vil|lage of <HI>Bauche-&s;arai.</HI> This Exemplary ju&s;tice rai&s;ed the reverence, and fear of the Country|people towards our Amba&s;&s;ador unto that degree, that during the time of the Earl of <HI>Winchil&s;ea,</HI> no|thing of this nature ever pa&s;&s;ed again, but on the contrary, the Pai&s;ants, and the people in the Countries round, honoured and feared him like one of their Pa&s;ha's, or great men.</P>
<P>The other bu&s;ine&s;s was of a different nature re|lating to the Emin, or Cu&s;tomer of <HI>Aleppo,</HI> who being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed of his Employment was now come to <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> before his departure from <HI>Aleppo,</HI> he had demanded of our Merchants there 16000 Dollars for Arrears of Cu&s;tom due to him, on Silk and other Goods; his pretence was fal&s;e and unju&s;t, how&s;oever it being u&s;ual for <HI>Turks</HI> upon every demand to gain an advantage, the matter was compounded with the Sum of 2500 Dol|lars, and &s;o the Cu&s;tomer departed with an ap|pearance of perfect &s;atisfactation; notwith&s;tand|ing which coming to <HI>Constantinople</HI> he renewed his preten&s;ions again, and by the favour of the <HI>Reis-Efendi</HI> or Secretary of State, &s;o proceeded in his bu&s;ine&s;s, that the Lord Amba&s;&s;ador was for|ced to make a &s;econd compo&s;ition with 2000 Dollars.</P>
<P>The Grand Signior and Vizier, as we &s;aid be|fore, being now at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> the Viziers Deputy, called by the name of the <HI>Caimacam,</HI> governed <HI>Constantinople,</HI> to whom our Amba&s;&s;ador, accor|ding to cu&s;tom made a vi&s;it, pre&s;enting him with eight Ve&s;ts.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e in ab&s;ence of the Vizier, it being u&s;ual for the Amba&s;&s;ador to make a Vi&s;it to the <HI>Bo&s;tan|gee-Ba&s;hee,</HI> or Head of the Gardiners; his Excel|lency pa&s;&s;ed that Complement on him, and pre|&s;ented him with four Ve&s;ts. This per&s;on though entitled Head-Gardiner, is yet of great power, making a con&s;iderable figure at Court; for he not only commands all the Gardiners belonging to the many <HI>Seraglio</HI>'s of the Grand Signior, which are very con&s;iderable in number, but his Juri&s;di|ction reaches all along the <HI>Bo&s;phorus,</HI> and com|mands the Villages, Woods and Countries at a far di&s;tance, &s;o that he may in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> be com|par'd to the chief Ranger.</P>
<P>It was now towards the Winter,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Kuperlee</HI> &s;ends for his Son.</NOTE> when this Vi|zier <HI>Kuperlee,</HI> finding him&s;elf mature with Age, and ready to fall like Autumn Fruit, &s;ent for his Son from <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> to bear a &s;hare with him in the Burden of the Empire. This he did with the con&s;ent of the Grand Signior, for he alledged, that being now feeble and decayed, he could not make his per&s;onal Addre&s;&s;es as formerly, nor at|tend at the Court to render his Maje&s;ty an ac|count of his Affairs; and therefore had need of &s;o tru&s;ty a Me&s;&s;enger as his Son, to carry his ad|vices and directions, and faithfully to communi|cate what he &s;hould encharge to his Relation; all others being on &s;ome con&s;ideration or other &s;u&s;pected, and at lea&s;t Enemies to him, or to the Grand Signior. the Sultan accepting the pro|po&s;ition and the Per&s;on, had often occa&s;ions of di&s;cour&s;e and familiarity with the Son, called <HI>Ahmet,</HI> who deported him&s;elf with that faith and prudence in the management of all his Affairs, that the old Vizier had no great difficulty to pro|cure a Grant of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion for him in that Office: For though there were many ob&s;tacles therein, as the abhorrency of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Policy from all he|reditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in places of tru&s;t; and the Youth of his Per&s;on, not exceeding thirty two years of Age, and &s;ome emulous, powerful, and ancient Competitors, who hated the Father;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Procures Succe&s;&s;i|on for his Son.</NOTE> Yet the old Fox had &s;o ingratiated him&s;elf with his Ma&s;ter, for (to &s;peak truly) he had been the only in&s;trument that had pre&s;erved him and his

The old Man acknowledged the favour with all humi|lity and thankfulne&s;s, declaring, that he had now &s;erved his Maje&s;ty faithfully for the &s;pace of five years, a longer proportion than commonly Vi|ziers had managed that Office, in &s;uch tem|pe&s;tuous and di&s;tracted times, who either for their own offences, or want of Providence, or good Conduct, have made &s;hipwrack of their own lives, and the Charge they pi|loted: But he had lived in the wor&s;t of times, when the &s;pirits of men with di&s;content were en|flamed round about him, and threatned the ruine of their Prince and Empire; and yet had reduced things to compo&s;ure, and to the obedience of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Yoke, that now he that was the Sultan might incline his Head to re&s;t with &s;ecurity, and enjoy his pa&s;times and plea&s;ures, without being interrupted by tho&s;e Con&s;piracies, which de&s;troy|ed his Father, and endangered him in his years of Infancy. And becau&s;e the continuance of his Se|curity and Glory depended on the execution of certain Maximes, which he had framed to him&s;elf, he was chalking out to his Son &s;uch undoubted Rules and Doctrines of Government, as would certainly tend to the glory and pro&s;perity of the Empire, being abundantly &s;atisfied that his Son was faithful, prudent, and active. But three things he particularly recommended to his Ma|je&s;ty.</P>

<P>On the <HI>19th</HI> of <HI>October,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Kuperlee <HI>dies.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Kuperlee</HI> having ended his days, who&s;e Di&s;ea&s;e was Old Age, and a Gan|grene in his Legs, his Son by Hatte&s;heriff, or the Grand Signior's Patent under his hand, taking the Seal, was con&s;tituted Vizier in the place of his Fa|ther, to the admiration and di&s;appointment of the graver Seniors, who were di&s;contented, not only to perceive them&s;elves neglected, but that per&s;on al&s;o to &s;upplant them, who was judged uncapa|ble of the Office, according to the Canon, and ancient Precedents of this Government.</P>
<P>The Body of <HI>Kuperlee</HI> was tran&s;ported to <HI>Con|&s;tantinople,</HI> where in his life time he had erected a very &s;tately and magnificent Structure, and his Monument over the Grave, or Vault, where he de&s;igned to be interred. In his life time he had filled it with Corn, which daily was di&s;tributed to the poor, and being emptied after his death, re|ceived his Corps, over which a &s;mall Mo&s;ch was endowed with Oyl for Lamps, and maintenance of certain Tali&s;mans and Softaes, to make Prayers and Offerings for his Soul.</P>
<P>The Father being thus interred,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pa&s;ha of <HI>Magna&s;ia</HI> cut off.</NOTE> <HI>Ahmet</HI> his Son began to contrive his own e&s;tabli&s;hment, and to &s;ettle his Greatne&s;s on the foundation of his Fa|thers Rules of Policy, from whom not to degene|rate in cruelty of Nature, or leave his Legacies unpaid to tho&s;e he had pro&s;cribed, he in the fir&s;t place &s;acrificed the Blood of the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Mag|na&s;ia</HI> to his Fathers Gho&s;t, with &s;ome other petty attendences; &s;o that the World perceived that they had changed the Vizier, but not his tyranny, or at lea&s;t the &s;ame &s;pirit of the Father &s;eemed to be renewed, tran&s;mitted again into the Per&s;on of the Son. But more difficult it was to obtain the like &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t <HI>Mortaza,</HI> the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Babylon,</HI> and the <HI>Kayab-begh,</HI> or Lieutenant General of the Jani&s;aries, who were long before (as we have &s;aid) marked out for de&s;truction by his Father. For the fir&s;t was the mo&s;t powerful Pa&s;ha of all <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> vigilant, and active, and had done and merited great rewards from his Ma&s;ter, and par|ticularly in decoying, and cutting off the Head of the Grand Rebel <HI>A&s;an</HI> Pa&s;ha, who dared the Sul|tan at the Gates of his Seraglio; but under&s;tand|ing the ill will of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Kuperlee</HI> again&s;t him, &s;tood always on his Guard, lodging with|out the Wall of the City, and under the prote|ction of his Arms and Souldiers, who were great|ly affected to the genero&s;ity of his Per&s;on; &s;o that, though many attempts were made upon him, and that Officers, or Executioners came from the Court, openly tendring from the Sultan the Pre&s;ent of a Sword, and Ve&s;t of Sables, the u&s;ual Signals of the <HI>Ottomon</HI> Grace, but privately bringing a Bow&s;tring, or a Halter; yet they were all entertained at a di&s;tance, and returned again with the &s;ame di&s;&s;imulation they had u&s;ed in their feigned Addre&s;&s;es. In like manner the <HI>Kayah|begh,</HI> an ancient, prudent, and experienced Com|mander, beloved by the Soldiery, and &s;ecured by the Priviledge of his Office, (for a <HI>Kayah-begh</HI> cannot be cut off during his Command, without infringement of the honour and order of the Ja|ni&s;aries) pre&s;erved &s;till his Station, and Com|mand in de&s;pight of the Viziers hate and endea|vours. But what could not be done by meer vir|tue of the ab&s;olute Power, was effected under the appearance of honour and favour of the Sul|tan, who by his Royal Commi&s;&s;ion, having made him Pa&s;ha of <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> he was at the &s;ame in&s;tant deprived of his Military Power and Priviledge, and lay now naked and expo&s;ed to the Arbitrary Plea&s;ure and will of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s Adver&s;ary. Nor could his prayers or tears incline the Grand Signiors mind to rever&s;e his Order, who, together with the Vizier, rather inforced it with the &s;pecious pretext of Favour and Grace for his former me|rits, and with commendation of his Abilitles agree|able to the importance of &s;o con&s;iderable a Go|vernment, encrea&s;ed the ju&s;t &s;u&s;picion of <HI>Solyman,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Solyman</HI> Pa&s;ha in di&s;grace.</NOTE> (for &s;o the <HI>Kayah-begh</HI> was called.) not being ig|norant of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Proverb, A <HI>Kayah-begh</HI> is like a Fi&s;h in the Water, which out of its Element immediately dies.

The Vizier now ha&s;ted <HI>Solyman</HI> Pa&s;ha to depart with all expedi|tion, not allowing him above Four or Five days time to make preparation for &s;o long a Journey, which otherwi&s;e he would have prolonged, as one, like the re&s;t of Mankind, de&s;irous to protract the thread of Life, imagining that in his journey, at &s;ome di&s;tance, where his Death might be mo&s;t ob&s;cure, and lea&s;t noted, the Edict of the Grand Signior might overtake him, and find a Grave for him in &s;ome &s;olitary De&s;ert, or unfre|quented Mountain. Wherefore he made one Day an Addre&s;s to the Vizier, under pretence of taking his la&s;t farewel, and freely ac|quainted him with his apprehen&s;ion and his

The Vizier reverencing the Years, and pitying the Conditi|on of &s;o worthy a Commander, aba&s;ed &s;olely by his Power, bid him be of good cheer, a&s;&s;uring him of his Life, &s;o long as he acted nothing con|trary unto his, which he confirmed by Vows, and all imaginable Prote&s;tations, encouraging him to proceed forward to his Government with tho&s;e cheerful Words and A&s;&s;urances, that <HI>Soly|man</HI> Pa&s;ha taking his farewel with more ea&s;e of mind, and confidence of Life, departed <HI>Adria|nople</HI> in three days after his de&s;ignment to the new Office:<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is &s;ent away.</NOTE> But not many days Journey had he advanced into <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> before the Grand Signiors and Viziers Commands overtook him, altering his de&s;ign for <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> and in&s;tead thereof or|dered him a Pilgrimage unto <HI>Mecha,</HI> and exile into the remote and de&s;ert parts of <HI>Arabia,</HI> until he &s;hould be thought worthy to be recalled by that power which bani&s;hed him. In like manner &s;ome few days after, the Mufti being on a <HI>Fri|day</HI> &s;eated in his place, in the Mo&s;ch of Sultan <HI>Se|lim</HI> (a very noble and famous Fabrick) and atten|ding there the Grand Signiors entrance, that he might begin his Prayers, was unexpectedly whi&s;|pered in the Ear, that he &s;hould retire and give place to another Mufti; which immediately he obeyed, and in four hours departed <HI>Adriano|ple,</HI> being bani&s;hed to <HI>Gallipoli,</HI> for his Friend&s;hip (as was &s;uppo&s;ed) to <HI>Solyman</HI> Pa&s;ha, and for not pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Fetfa</HI> for his Death, according to the will and de&s;ire of the Grand Signior.</P>
<P>During the Tran&s;action of the&s;e affairs in divers parts, the Wars again&s;t the <HI>Venetians</HI> were carri|ed on faintly; the Gallies had no other de&s;ign, or employment, than to tran&s;port recruits of Men and Ammunition to <HI>Canea,</HI> that &s;o the <HI>Turks</HI> might rather keep the ground that they had gained in that I&s;land, than add thereunto by new Conque&s;ts, until &s;uch time as that being freed from other Wars, they might have lei&s;ure and opportunity to attend unto that alone. Accor|dingly the Captain Pa&s;ha &s;et forth at the u&s;ual Sea&s;on from <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> and arrived at <HI>Scio</HI> with twenty three Gallies, be&s;ides his own called the <HI>Ba&s;tard-Gally,</HI> or Admiral; the advice of which, coming to the Captain-General of the <HI>Ve|netians,</HI> he ha&s;tned thither with all his Fleet to be|&s;iege him in the Port: but this &s;eeming after &s;ome days a tedious work, and what might lo&s;e too much time; he re&s;olved to depart from thence, and &s;o leaving a &s;ufficient Guard before the Port, he &s;et Sail with two Gallea&s;&s;es, thirteen light Gal|lies, and &s;even Auxiliaries for the Coa&s;t of <HI>Rhodes;</HI> where his Brigantines advi&s;ed, that the remainder of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Fleet were Anchored, and were taking aboard two thou&s;and Soldiers for reinforcing <HI>Canea;</HI> but before the <HI>Venetians</HI> could arrive, intelligence was given them by the way, that the <HI>Turks</HI> were loo&s;ed from <HI>Rhodes,</HI> and were Anchored under the I&s;land of <HI>Patmos;</HI> wherefore altering their cour&s;e, they &s;teered for <HI>Nio,</HI> and there watering their Ve&s;&s;els, &s;ailed near to <HI>Nixia,</HI> where the Van-guard di&s;covered five and thirty Gallies of the Enemy, which had made prize of a Tartana laden with Provi&s;ions de&s;ign|ed for the <HI>Venetian</HI> Fleet, and having taken out her lading, had &s;et her on fire. The <HI>Venetians</HI> ha|ving their Enemy in their Eye, gave them cha&s;e until the Evening, when the Night coming on, put an end to the pur&s;uit: but keeping their cour&s;e towards <HI>Candia,</HI> they had &s;ight again of them the next Morning, and coming nearer, the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Admiral put forth his Flag of Defiance, as if he intended to come to a Battel; but the Wind blowing hard, and the Sea increa&s;ing, both Fleets were &s;eparated until the Morning; when the <HI>Venetians</HI> di&s;covered certain of the Enemies Gallies to Leeward of <HI>Milo,</HI> where bearing down before the Wind upon them, five of them ran a|&s;hore; one was &s;unk, and four were taken by the <HI>Venetian</HI> and <HI>Malte&s;e</HI> Gallies, three of which fighting with great Courage and Valour, killed divers brave Cavaliers of one and the other Coun|try.

<P>AT the beginning of this Year the People of <HI>Algier</HI> &s;ent Me&s;&s;engers and Pre&s;ents to the Grand signiors Court, then at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> com|plaining again&s;t the Actions His Maje&s;ties Fleet, under the Com|mand of the Earl of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> had done again&s;t their Town and Ca&s;tles, pretending tho&s;e Forts to be the Grand Signiors, and the Affront offered to him, as willing to intere&s;t him in thier Quarrels and Piracies. And that thier Addre&s;&s;es might be more graciou&s;ly received, they brought with them certain Pre&s;ents, which tho in former time swere Yearly, were now only as their Affairs required, and on this occa&s;ion were doubled: for be&s;ides their Pre&s;ents to the Mini&s;ters and Officers of State; they brought to the Grand Signior a Ship made in Silver, be&s;et with Emrods, Rubies, and other Stones; fourteen young and han&s;om Boys, and a neger Eunuch for the <HI>Seraglio.</HI> But the Earl of <HI>Winchel&s;ea,</HI> His Maje&s;ties Emba&s;&s;ador there Re&s;ident, being then at Court, had &s;o well prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Vizier with the Ground and Rea|&s;ons for the War, that the complaints of <HI>Algier</HI> were judged in no wi&s;e touching the <HI>Ottoman</HI> In|tere&s;t, or the breach of Peace, any Impeach|ment of the good Corre&s;pondence and Friend|&s;hip which then intervened between the King of <HI>England</HI> and the Grand Signior. But their Pre|&s;umption to &s;earch <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships, and take out Strangers Goods, was objected as an Argument of their Di&s;obedience and Rebellion, contrary to the Grand Signiors Capitulations, which al&s;o was aggravated by their ill Treatment of the Grand Signiors Pa&s;ha, whom they had beaten, impri&s;oned, and ca&s;t out of all Power and Authority; which &s;evere Reprehen&s;ions &s;o terrified and di&s;couraged them, that they not only de&s;i&s;ted from their Pre|ten&s;ions again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> but began to fear, le&s;t the Power and Intere&s;t of the Amba&s;&s;ador at Court, &s;hould contrive &s;ome mi&s;chief to their own Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>Soon after this the Vizier e&s;teeming it nece&s;&s;ary towards his better e&s;tabli&s;hment to gratifie the City of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gr.

How&s;oever the Vizier had &s;o far entered into his Affection and E&s;teem, that his Per&s;wa&s;ions were &s;tronger than his own ab&s;olute Dominion; and prevailed &s;o with him again&s;t the force of his own Fancy, that about the Equinoctial he began his Journey
<PB N="116" REF="62">towards <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> to the great Joy and Sa|tisfaction of his People: But by the way lingring out his time in Hunting and other Pa&s;times of the Woods and Fields; it was the <HI>30th</HI> of <HI>March</HI> be|fore he made his Entry, for never was Prince &s;o great a <HI>Nimrod,</HI> &s;o unwearied a Hunt&s;man as this; never was he at quiet, but continually in the Fields on Hor&s;eback, ri&s;ing &s;ometimes at Mid|night, to ride up the Mountains, that he might more early di&s;cover the Sun in the Morning; by which extravagant cour&s;e of Life, he wearied out his Court and Attendants, who began to be|lieve the amorous humour of the Father more &s;upportable, than the wandring Vagaries, and re&s;tle&s;s Spirit of the Son.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gr. Signiors extrava|gant Hunt|ing.</NOTE> But not only were his Huntings tedious to his Court, but trouble&s;ome and expen&s;ive to the whole Country, which were all &s;ummoned in where&s;oever he came, and &s;ome|times thirty or forty thou&s;and men appointed to beat the Woods for three or four days, carrying before them the compa&s;s of a days Journey about, inclo&s;ing all the Game and wild Bea&s;ts within that Circuit, which on the day of the Hunt, the Grand Signior kills and de&s;troys with Dogs, Guns, or any other way, with abundance of noi&s;e and confu&s;ion; which Pa&s;time, tho lawful in it &s;elf, and commendable enough in &s;o great a Prince, yet the frequent u&s;e of it, was a burden and an oppre&s;&s;ion to his People, whil&s;t in the Winter they pa&s;&s;ed many cold Nights in the Woods, and being unu&s;ed to that hard&s;hip, many of them paid for their Emperors Pa&s;time with their own lives.</P>
<P>The Grand Signior being now at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Vizier endea|vours to e&s;tabli&s;h him&s;elf.</NOTE> the Vizier judged not him&s;elf &s;o well fixed in his Government, but that through the Malice of his powerful Enemies, who were familiar to the Grand Signiors Ear, he was then in danger to be &s;haken; the principal of which was <HI>Kuzlir Aga,</HI> or chief Eunuch of the Women of the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> who by means of the Valede, or Queen Mother, was ill-affected to him, being both inclined to prefer &s;ome Favourites of their own, for the Diminuti|tion and Eclip&s;e of the Viziers Power, one where|of was the <HI>Tefterdar</HI> Pa&s;ha, or Lord Trea&s;urer, placed in Office again&s;t the Viziers Approbation, which the Vizier under&s;tanding, made &s;hort Work with him, depriving him of his Office, commanded him in a few hours to quit <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople.</HI></P>
<P>But the Queen Mother, and <HI>Kuzlir Aga</HI> re&s;ent|ting this Affront to their Favourie, re&s;olved to even &s;cores in a piece of the like Nature: Where|fore they obtained for the <HI>Viziers Kahya,</HI> or Steward, the Pa&s;halick of <HI>Darbiquier,</HI> a rich and honourable Government, not for any di&s;affe|ction or hatred they had unto him, but only to deprive the Vizier of the Coun&s;el and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;o knowing and faithful a Servant; for he was a Per&s;on, who by his own E&s;tate and Friends had rai&s;ed the Hou&s;e of <HI>Kuperlee,</HI> having in the time of his Poverty and Meanne&s;s lent him that Sum of Money, which gave him the fir&s;t Ri&s;e to his Riche&s;s and Authority; for Re|compence and Intere&s;t of which, old <HI>Kuperlee</HI> made him his Steward, and &s;hared to him his Honours and Pro&s;perity; in which deporting him&s;elf towards all People with the &s;ame mode&s;ty and evenne&s;s of Temper which he u&s;ed in his for|mer Condition, he procured no Enemies to his own Per&s;on, and &s;uch as hated the Intere&s;t he &s;erved, only wi&s;hing him di&s;obliged from it, &s;o as to be able to di&s;pen&s;e their Malice on the Vi|zier, without concerning him in his Ma&s;ters ruin. This con&s;ideration moved the angry Lady, and the envious Eunuch to vex their Adver&s;ary by the removal of his mo&s;t faithful Creature and Ser|vant.</P>
<P><HI>Mahomet Kahya</HI> now Pa&s;ha of <HI>Darbiquier,</HI> after a rea&s;onable and convenient time allowed him for his Preparations, being very rich, &s;et for|ward towards his Government, with a very noble and numerous Retinue, having among&s;t the re&s;t five hundred Per&s;ons young, well mounted, and well armed; which notwith&s;tanding were not &s;o &s;trong, but before they were advanced many days Journey into <HI>A&s;ia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A notable Robber<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> were encoun|tred by a greater force of bold and de&s;perate Robbers, who engaging with him, killed two hundred of his People on the place, rifled his Baggage, and con&s;trained the Pa&s;ha him&s;elf to fly to the next City. This &s;trange and audacious Robbery produced many Commands and Orders for Seizure and Suppre&s;&s;ion of Theives in the le&s;&s;er <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> And becau&s;e the cu&s;tom is, that &s;omething mu&s;t be done in Compliance with the Imperial Commands, many poor innocent Men were taken in the Fields and Mountains, and per|haps without any other Crime again&s;t them, than that they were not ma&s;ters of a thou&s;and A&s;pers to bribe the Officers, were for want thereof &s;ent as Thieves to the Port, where with|out further Conviction or Tryal they were exe|cuted.</P>
<P>The Vizier being thus weakned by the remo|val of his faithfulle&s;t Friend, his Condition was given over as de&s;perate by the generality of the World, and &s;everal appearances of Troubles ari&s;ing from the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> and <HI>We&s;tern</HI> parts, gave occa&s;ion to the Queen Mother, and her Party, to di&s;parage his Abilities in the e&s;teem of the Sul|tan: Wherefore they exhorted him to imitate the Example of his Renowned Predece&s;&s;ors, who made u&s;e of their Viziers only to ea&s;e them from the trouble&s;om part of their Government, but did not entirely throw off the Knowledg and Pri|vity of the important Tran&s;actions and State Af|fairs in the whole Empire. This Le&s;&s;on awaken|ed the Grand Signior a little, &s;o that he declined &s;ome days his Sports abroad, and Exerci&s;e on Hor&s;e-back, and in&s;tead thereof pa&s;&s;ed much of his time in a <HI>Chiosk,</HI> or Garden-hou&s;e on the Wall of the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to the Viziers Gate, where his chief Bu&s;ine&s;s and Concernment was to ob&s;erve &s;uch as went in, or came out; and when at any time he e&s;pied tho&s;e enter, re|markable for their Attendance, or difference of Habit, he would &s;end to know of the Vizier, what occa&s;ion drew tho&s;e People thither, what their Bu&s;ine&s;s was, and the like, by which he gave him&s;elf that Satisfaction as to believe that he had now found the true way of in&s;pecting his Affairs, and taking care of his Empire.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen Mothers Enmity to the Vizier.</NOTE> The Vizier was not in&s;en&s;ible from whence this humour of the Gr.

But to execute this &s;tout Coun&s;el with Prudence and Wi&s;dom, he con|ceived it nece&s;&s;ary, if po&s;&s;ible, to reconcile the &s;incere Friend&s;hip of <HI>Samozade,</HI> the <HI>Reis Effendi,</HI> or Chief Secretary of State, a Per&s;on the be&s;t practi&s;ed of any, in the Affairs and Nogotiations of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, and one much in the E&s;teem and Favour of the Queen Mother, and in order thereunto treats him with more Famili|arity and Conde&s;cen&s;ion than was ordinary, or by many judged agreeable to the Greatne&s;s of a Grand Vizier; for always when he came into his Pre&s;ence, he aro&s;e up, calling him &s;ecretly Fa|ther, Tutor and Companion, in &s;upporting the Burden of the weighty Government, and &s;uch other Compellations, as the Grand Signior vouch&s;afed only to the Vizier: for tho this <HI>Reis Effendi</HI> was of the greate&s;t Abilities, and this pre&s;ent Vizier the mo&s;t youthful and unexperi|enced of later Times, yet it may be accounted one &s;pecial mark and token of his Prudence, in knowing how to elect &s;o u&s;eful a Friend, and of his Policy in procuring his &s;incere faithful|ne&s;s towards him, and making him really his own. To which end he conver&s;ed much with him, com|municated all his thoughts, freely demanded his advice, received his private Entertainments, and in fine, was wanting in no points of affable Cour|te&s;y and Compliance, whereby he might create him his own, contenting for &s;ome time him&s;elf with the name of Vizier, tho the other as one, who be&s;t knew how to manage it, enjoyed the Power.</P>
<P>The Chief Officers of the <HI>Seraglio,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">That is, of the <HI>Hazo|da,</HI> or Royal Chamber.</NOTE> in&s;tigated by the Queen Mother to dimini&s;h &s;omething the Power of the Vizier, put often the Grand Signior in mind, as a matter agreeable to his Dignity, to have a regard to his Government, which cau&s;ed him more frequently than his humour &s;erved, to betake him&s;elf to his <HI>Choisk</HI> over a|gain&s;t the Viziers Gate, to make his u&s;ual Ob|&s;ervations; and perceiving &s;ome Chri&s;tians to enter the Court with red Calpacks or Caps, and yellow Shooes (prohibited to Chri&s;tians by or|ders of inferior Magi&s;trates, but never until now thought worthy the Imperal Ob&s;ervance) imme|diately called for the Suba&s;hee or Con&s;table of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and from the Window command|ed him with great Fury to enter the Viziers Court, and &s;uch Chri&s;tians as he &s;hould find there with yellow Shooes and red Caps he &s;hould fir&s;t beat, and then &s;end uncovered and barefooted home. The Suba&s;hee armed with a Power in this matter as high as the Viziers, entered the Hou&s;e without Complement or Licence, and encountring fir&s;t the <HI>Kapikahya</HI>'s or Agents of <HI>Moldavia</HI> and <HI>Valachia</HI> negotiating the Affairs of their Prince and Coun|try, he rudely layed them down, and without Re&s;pect to their Per&s;ons or Office, beat them on the Feet, tore off their red Stockins and Caps, and &s;ent them home with their Heads and Feet bare, derided by the People,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gr. Signiors &s;evere Prohibiti|on of yel|low &s;hoes, and red Calpacks to Chri&s;ti|ans.</NOTE> and lamenting the Affliction of that Tyranny to which they were &s;ubjected. This inhumane Treatment of Per&s;ons in a manner &s;acred, was &s;econded by publick Proclamations, &s;trictly prohibiting all Chri&s;tians from wearing red Caps, yellow Shooes, &s;carlet Ve&s;ts, and the like; and <HI>Janizaries</HI> from the u&s;e of Hanjars or Daggers, and &s;ilk Turbants, upon pain of Death; which Order was &s;o &s;trictly en|joyned, that the Corners of every Street were furni&s;hed with Officers to ob&s;erve, and puni&s;h &s;uch as were found to offend. The Grand Signi|or Rim&s;elf judged al&s;o the Execution of this Or|der of that importance, as to de&s;erve his own proper Care and In&s;pection; wherefore walking abroad, as his manner was, in di&s;gui&s;e, with his Executione at hand, encountred in the Streets an unfortunate Bridegroom, an Armenian, who that day, on priviledge of his E&s;pou&s;als, had ad|ventured to dre&s;s him&s;elf with yellow leathern Soks: nothing was, or could have time to be pleaded in his behalf, before the fatal Blow was &s;truck, which &s;ent him to his Grave in&s;tead of his Nupital Bed. This fury continued &s;ome few days with much rigour, and &s;trict ob&s;ervation, but afterwards growing cold again, all care was neglected, happening herein, as commonly it doth in all things, which have no other foundation than humour and fancy.</P>
<P>But this in&s;pection into petty matters did not &s;o much di&s;turb the thoughts of the Vizier, as did the power and greatne&s;s of <HI>Mortaza</HI> the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Babylon,</HI> by the Turks called <HI>Bagdat,</HI> a per&s;on of an undaunted Courage, and greate Conduct, whom he had hitherto &s;uffered to live, contra|ry to the true knowledge of his intere&s;t, and the Rules his Father had left him: wherefore he re&s;olved to renew his de&s;ign and attempts again&s;t his Life, one I remember was in <HI>December</HI> of the pa&s;t Year, when in our Journey to <HI>Adrianople,</HI> we met a Me&s;&s;enger on the way, who among&s;t other Di&s;cour&s;es informed us, that he was then going to <HI>Bablyon</HI> for confirmation of <HI>Mortaza,</HI> and as a te&s;timony of the G. Signiors favour and good will towards him, he carried him a Sword, and a Ve&s;t of Sables: we immediatly, and that truly, gue&s;&s;ed for what Pre&s;ent the Sword was &s;ent; for in &s;ome Months after the Chaous-ba&s;hee, or chief of the Pur&s;uivants, returned without delivery of his Pre&s;ent.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Vi|zier &s;eeks to cut of <HI>Mortaza</HI> the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Baby|lon.</HI></NOTE> For the wi&s;e <HI>Mortaza</HI> was &s;o ju&s;tly Jealous, that he would not &s;o much as admit him to his Pre&s;ence, but returned him again with his Sword and Sables for tho&s;e who were more ea&s;y and credulous, and who believe to dye by Com|mand of the Sultan to be Martyrdom, and the only Crown of all their Merits and De&s;erts: and knowing that he could not long &s;ub&s;i&s;t in Oppo|&s;ition to &s;o great an Enemy; he contracted an Al|liance by Marriage with a Daughter of one of the <HI>Gordean,</HI> or <HI>Curdean</HI> Princes, and in Dowry had one of the &s;tronge&s;t Forts of tho&s;e Mountains delivered into his hands.</P>
<P>The Vizier finding him&s;elf thus foiled in his oc|cult Artifices, began publickly to profe&s;s his En|mity; and therefore in the fir&s;t place per&s;waded the Grand Signior, that the long continuance of <HI>Mortaza</HI> in that Government, beyond the u&s;ual term, &s;o Opulent and Powerful, and of a Spirit &s;o Ambitions and Rebellious, could not but prove dangerous to him&s;elf, and in time give him Con|fidence of Competition for the whole Empire; which hazard to prevent with mo&s;t prudence and advantage, (there being a pre&s;ent occa&s;ion of good Soldiers for relief of <HI>Candia</HI>) <HI>Mortaza</HI> and
<PB N="118" REF="63">his Complices could not be better be&s;towed than upon that Employment. The Grand Signior readily con&s;ented to his Coun&s;el, being naturally very apprehen&s;ive of Danger, and in his place con&s;tituted the <HI>Aga,</HI> or General of the <HI>Janizaries,</HI> po&s;ting him away with all &s;peed-po&s;&s;ible to his Government; who did not run &s;o fa&s;t in his Journey, but that the advices of the coming of a new Pa&s;ha, arrived timely the Ears of <HI>Mortaza,</HI> who judging it an unequal match to contend with the whole Empire, gave way to his Succe&s;&s;or, but withal, kept him&s;elf &s;o on his Guard, that his Adver&s;ary could not reach his Head, and &s;end it as the fir&s;t-fruits and Tribute of his new Of|fice. For yielding up his command as in an ho|nourable manner of Retreat, he gave out, that with his Army (reported to con&s;i&s;t of Forty thou&s;and Men) he was on his March to <HI>Can|dia,</HI> but &s;oon after his de&s;ign was di&s;co|vered to be otherwi&s;e; for believing his own Force unable to contend with his Ma&s;ters, he re|tired with his riche&s;s, and &s;ome of tho&s;e mo&s;t faith|ful to him, unto his Fort on the Mountains, and to the Protection and Country of the King of the <HI>Curdi,</HI> who&s;e Daughter he had Married, and re|mained in Epectation of time and opportunity, to take his revenge on the Vizier, hoping that with time this &s;torm would blow over, and that the Beams of his Princes Favour would again &s;hine upon him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Curdi.</NOTE> The&s;e <HI>Curdi</HI> are called by &s;ome Wri|ters <HI>Cordiaei,</HI> from whence the Province had the name of <HI>Gordiene,</HI> bordering on <HI>A&s;&s;yria,</HI> the King|dom once of <HI>Zabienus,</HI> who &s;iding with <HI>Lucullus</HI> again&s;t <HI>Tigranes</HI> King of <HI>Armenia,</HI> was by <HI>Tigra|nes</HI> murdered with his Wife and Children. The&s;e People inhabit the Mountain <HI>Amanus,</HI> dividing <HI>Syria</HI> from <HI>Cilicia,</HI> which by rea&s;on of the diffi|cult acce&s;s thereunto, was never yet &s;ubjected to the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Yoke; they are &s;aid in former times to have wor&s;hipped a black Dog, and dare not &s;peak ill of the Devil, not for love, but fear. But &s;ome report, that have lately been among&s;t them, that they have left off that helli&s;h Super&s;ti|tion, and embrace a certain &s;ort of Religion mix|ed with Chri&s;tianity and Turci&s;m; but yet without Bapti&s;m or Circumci&s;ion. In brief, they are a bad &s;ort of gro&s;s People at the be&s;t, contenting them|&s;elves with little Religion, addicted to Blood and Robberies. The&s;e <HI>Curdi</HI> or <HI>Gordeenes,</HI> being a peo|ple retired, keep within their Mountains, are &s;hy in their Conver&s;ation and Di&s;cour&s;e, and afford us little &s;ubject, or opportunity of knowing with any Satisfaction, their Religion or Manners; but from &s;uch of our Country-men, as have lately entertained Society with them, we have this ac|count. They are &s;eated on tho&s;e Mountains, as we have &s;aid before, which of old are called <HI>Cor|diaei</HI> or <HI>Gordiai,</HI> beginning near <HI>Aleppo,</HI> but run|ning out as far as <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> they make &s;hew of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Religion for fear, but have in reality ano|ther of their own, which permits them to eat Swines Fle&s;h, and drink Wine, as the <HI>Dru&s;es</HI> and <HI>Kalbeenes;</HI> Bacon being e&s;teemed by them a particular Cordial, or Re&s;torative for the Sick. The chief Country and City of tho&s;e near <HI>Aleppo,</HI> is called <HI>Jeumee,</HI> where they have a Convent of twelve Prie&s;ts with a Superior over them, and ano|ther of the like &s;ort near <HI>Mo&s;ul</HI> or <HI>Nineveth.</HI> The two Chiefs of the&s;e Mona&s;teries meet at fixed times to con&s;ult for the good of the Com|mon-weal. Their Devotions are private in a Cave; they tell us of but one Book, which contains both their Law and their Rituals; being asked what they thought of our Saviour, they an&s;wer|ed, he was their Breath, and their Soul; at the name of <HI>Mahomet</HI> they Spit, and with <HI>Nicode|mus</HI> his Circum&s;pection and A&s;&s;urance of Secrecy, they declared, them&s;elves and Chri&s;tians the &s;ame, which they would make appear &s;o &s;oon as they were delivered from their fear of Bondage to the <HI>Turk.</HI> They &s;ay that they wor&s;hip God, and will not cur&s;e the Devil, to which no Force or Power can compel them partly, perhaps becau&s;e they have heard of our Saviours Precept, <HI>Ble&s;s, and Cur&s;e not,</HI> but rather, becau&s;e they hold, that the Devil and his Followers &s;hall one day be re&s;to|red to their former &s;eats of Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s and Digni|ty. When their Prie&s;ts are together, and Wine brought in among&s;t them, the Superior makes a &s;ign for Silence, and afterwards a &s;hort Admoni|tion, that Wine is the Blood of God. I have heard that a <HI>Capuchin</HI> Fryer was once invited a|mong&s;t them, with Promi&s;e to give him a &s;ight of their Book of Rituals, and being come to <HI>Jeumee,</HI> was detained a day or two in a Cave, on pretence that the other Superior of <HI>Mo&s;ul</HI> was then among&s;t them, who being a &s;evere Per&s;on, if he knew of his being there, would certainly put him to Death, as one who came to alter their Religi|on; upon which Su&s;picion the <HI>Capuchin</HI> forgetting his Curio&s;ity, fled for &s;afety, with all &s;peed po&s;|&s;ible. Their Prie&s;ts are &s;aid to be Grave, wearing black throughout; their Garments plaited or quilted; the Ve&s;tures of the Commonalty are a|greeable to Mountainiers, who&s;e Natures are Rough and Boi&s;terous, addicted to Blood and Rob|bery, the common Vice of tho&s;e People. I have heard, that the Son of a <HI>Gourdeene</HI> Widow being killed by &s;ome of that Country, She a&s;&s;embled her neare&s;t Kindred, and required them to bring her the Windpipe of the Murderer, which when they had done, She together with her Friends, eat in it Revenge. In fine, their Religion may have &s;ome &s;mall Reliques of Chri&s;tianity, but mixt with the dregs of other Religions. 'Tis po&s;&s;ible they may be of the <HI>Manichee</HI> Race. Their Opi|nion of the Devils Re&s;toration, was once held in part by <HI>Origen:</HI> that of Wine (that it is the Blood of God) was the <HI>Heatheni&s;h</HI> conceit of the <HI>Egyp|tian</HI> Prie&s;ts. Their whole Nation, if well united, may compo&s;e an Army of thirty or forty thou&s;and Men.</P>
<P>But to return to our purpo&s;e. The news of the Flight of <HI>Mortaza</HI> to this Ignoble Prince, troubled the Grand Signior, who &s;till retained &s;ome Impre&s;&s;ions of kindne&s;s to his Per&s;on, re|membring his Genero&s;ity, Valour, and former De&s;erts, the memory of which was encrea&s;ed al&s;o by the Friends of <HI>Mortaza,</HI> who wanted not in the Court to repre&s;ent them with &s;ome Compa&s;|&s;ion, arguing that his flight was not of Contuma|cy or Contempt to his Ma&s;ters Protection, but an effect of natural Pre&s;ervation; which worked &s;o far on the Grand Signior, that he immediately &s;ent for the Vizier to enquire of him the State and Condition of <HI>Mortaza.</HI> The Vizier to defend him&s;elf, and make good what before he had coun&s;elled his Ma&s;ter, aggravated his Adver&s;a|ry's Crimes, and his Di&s;obedience and Flight to an incon&s;iderable King; with which, and &s;ome other light Excu&s;es and Per&s;wa&s;ions, that the re|moval of &s;uch a Per&s;on was agreeable to the pre|&s;ent State of Affairs, and conducing to his own Se|curity, ea&s;ily pacified the Mind and Affections of the Grand Signior; but no &s;ooner was he return|ed to his Hou&s;e, but advice was given him, that the <HI>Emaum</HI> of <HI>Mortaza,</HI> or his Prie&s;t or Chaplain, was then at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> whom the Vizier im|mediatly &s;ent for, and without any Plea or Indict|ment, &s;truck off his Head, and threw his Body in|to to the Sea, on pretence that he was &s;ent thither, as a Spy for his Ma&s;ter, and to give Intelligence, and a
<PB N="119" REF="63">beginning to Rebellion: The&s;e were his colours and allegations for his de&s;erved Death; for Go|vernours though never &s;o wicked and &s;o ab&s;olute, and that have no need to render any other cau&s;e to the World of their actions, than their own will, yet e&s;teem it nece&s;&s;ary to act under the &s;pecious gui&s;e of ju&s;tice, and in the good opinion of the multitude. The Aga of <HI>Babylon</HI> encountred the &s;ame Fortune; for <HI>Mortaza</HI> giving place, he thought it fit for him&s;elf to do the like; re&s;olving for <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> but being intercepted in his Journey by the new Pa&s;ha, his Head was &s;truck off, and his Journey &s;hortned.</P>
<P>But that which again renewed the trouble and fears of the Vizier, was a report that the late <HI>Kahya-begh</HI> degraded at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> was &s;ecretly returned to the City, and lived concealed, giving &s;uch Orders to the Janizaries as tended to Mutiny and In&s;urrection, and that the pretences and re|ports of his being gone to <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> and thence in his holy Pilgrimage to <HI>Mecha,</HI> were but all fal&s;e &s;tories to conceal his Re&s;idence at <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople.</HI> This &s;et the Vizier all on fire, and made him tremble with the thoughts of it; wherefore &s;earch was made for him day and night, but not found; for in reality he as gone on his de&s;igned Journey, only it was the misfortune of his Kahya, or Steward, as before it was of <HI>Mortaza</HI>'s Emaum, to fall into the Viziers hands, who being beaten to confe&s;s where his Ma&s;ter was, died afterwards of the blows.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding that <HI>Mortaza</HI> was fled, yet the Vizier laid not a&s;ide his fears and thoughts concerning him, not knowing how &s;oon he might be recalled home, and &s;eated in his place; of which various Examples are extant in <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory; and therefore he &s;ent orders to <HI>Mahomet</HI> Pa&s;ha, his late Kahya, now Pa&s;ha of <HI>Darbiquier,</HI> as Ge|neral (with the knowledge and con&s;ent of the Grand Signior) and to the Pa&s;haws of <HI>Aleppo, Erzirum</HI> and others near adjacent, to prepare and a&s;&s;emble what Force was nece&s;&s;ary to con|&s;train the King of the <HI>Curdi,</HI> to &s;urrender <HI>Morta|za</HI> into their hands: But whil&s;t the&s;e matters were in agitation, &s;ome unexpected troubles in <HI>Georgia</HI> diverted their Arms, and held them for &s;ome time in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, not knowing what the i&s;&s;ue might be. The Original and Ground thereof was this:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pro|vinces of <HI>Georgia</HI> in di&s;tur|bance.</NOTE> After <HI>Sultan Solyman</HI> had taken <HI>Erzirum,</HI> it was agreed in the Capitulations between the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Per|&s;ians,</HI> that of the &s;even Provinces of <HI>Georgia</HI> (an|ciently called <HI>Iberia,</HI> but now as &s;uppo&s;ed to have received the Denomination from St. <HI>George,</HI> the Cappadocian Martyr, there had in great e&s;teem and reverence) three &s;hould be tributaries to the <HI>Turk,</HI> and three to the <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> all govern'd by <HI>Achic-ba&s;h</HI> as head and &s;upream Prince, to whom the Seventh &s;hould al&s;o be &s;ubje&s;ted, without ac|knowledgment to either; in payment of which Tribute, they continued mo&s;t willingly, le&s;t for default thereof, the importation of Salt, of which their Provinces afford none, &s;hould I be hindred either from the <HI>Turki&s;h,</HI> or <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Dominion. And now it happened that <HI>Achic-ba&s;h</HI> dying, his Wife married again, who to gratifie her new Lover, was contented to have the eyes of her Son put out, who was the lawful Heir to the Govern|ment. This Fact was &s;o hainou&s;ly received by the Princes of the three Provinces under the <HI>Per|&s;ian,</HI> that with common con&s;ent, they elected one to &s;ucceed <HI>Achic-ba&s;h,</HI> and extorted the power out of the hands of the Amorous Traitor. The Princes of the three Provinces under the <HI>Turk</HI> alarm'd hereat, made in&s;urrection, re&s;olving rather than any Foreigner, to &s;et up one of the Kindred of <HI>Achic-ba&s;h,</HI> which the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Provinces better under&s;tanding, approved likewi&s;e, and for confirmation, and maintenance of their choice, a&s;&s;embled an Army of Three&s;core thou&s;and men. The Pa&s;haws tending towards <HI>Curdi,</HI> were &s;urprized in their March with the news of the&s;e di&s;turbances in <HI>Georgia,</HI> and not rightly apprehending the cau&s;es of the&s;e &s;ud|den commotions, gave an arre&s;t to the pro|gre&s;s of their Arms, inclining towards the parts of <HI>Georgia,</HI> to be in a readine&s;s to &s;uppre&s;s all de&s;igns again&s;t the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Dominions, &s;o that the thoughts of War again&s;t the <HI>Curdi</HI> was for &s;ome time laid a&s;ide. The news of the&s;e troubles did al&s;o alarm the Port, with which al&s;o came a report, That &s;ix hundred Tents of the <HI>Kuzilba|&s;hees</HI> (which are the be&s;t &s;ort of <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Hor&s;emen) were pitched nigh the Confines of the Grand Sig|niors Territories; &s;o that Orders were di&s;patched to the afore&s;aid Pa&s;haws to watch the motion and i&s;&s;ue of tho&s;e Affairs, but tho&s;e &s;torms blowing over by the e&s;tabli&s;hment of <HI>Achic-ba&s;h,</HI> the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Forces proceeded on their fir&s;t de&s;ign again&s;t <HI>Mor|taza,</HI> marching to the pa&s;s of the Country of the <HI>Curdi,</HI> which is very &s;teep, a&s;perous and rough.

<P>The Vizier upon this &s;ucce&s;s began to &s;hew a more cheerful Countenance than formerly, &s;u&s;pecting le&s;s of danger upon removal of &s;o &s;u&s;picious an Enemy. And truly it was now hard to &s;ay where in the whole Empire was a generous, bold, or ambitious &s;pirit remaining, who had Reputation and Authority enough to attempt a priority, &s;uch havock was made by this Viziers Father of all hopeful and daring di&s;po&s;itions, and &s;uch an Addition made to the &s;laughter by this man in pre&s;ent Office, that whether mens &s;pirits were vanqui&s;hed, and cow|ed with former Examples, or that the Age really afforded not &s;uch Heroes, it is hard to &s;ay: None now appearing other than ob&s;e|quious to this Vizier, and to fear, and court him.</P>
<P>The Vizier having thus &s;ucce&s;sfully contrived his E&s;tabli&s;hment, and &s;ecurity at home, had time to confirm it by his Wars abroad, well judging that foreign Wars allay Civil Di&s;&s;enti|ons, and the Pro&s;perity thereof doth both pro|duce reputation and terrour of his Per&s;on among&s;t his Enemies, as well as reconcile affections, and increa&s;e Authority among&s;t his &s;ubjects at home. Wherefore he meditated on a War again&s;t the Em|peror, and was glad to embrace the occa&s;ion from the late Di&s;turbances made in <HI>Tran&s;ilvania</HI> by <HI>Kemenius,</HI> as we have related in the former Year. But yet like a crafty Politician, who looketh one way, and &s;teers another; &s;o the Vizier, that he might the better lull the <HI>Germans</HI> into a &s;leep, and apprehen&s;ions of &s;e|curity, he di&s;&s;embled his inclinations to Peace, and to hearken to &s;uch propo&s;itions as were ten|dered him by the <HI>German</HI> Re&s;ident, namely, that the Fort of <HI>Serini</HI> &s;hould be demoli&s;hed; being built again&s;t the intention, and without the knowledge or con&s;ent of his Imperial Ma&s;ter; that the Gari&s;ons of <HI>Zechelhid, Colo&s;war,</HI> and other places &s;hould be removed, with other over|tures, and the faire&s;t Propo&s;itions imaginable, which might give the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;atisfaction, and by &s;ome means or other reconcile the differences, if po&s;&s;ible.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The re&s;o|lution of War un|certain.</NOTE> To which coun&s;el the Emperor was the rather inclinable, in regard that a Treaty at that time was on foot between the <HI>French</HI> King, and the Duke of <HI>Lorain</HI> for <HI>Al&s;atia,</HI> and that the re|&s;ult might prove prejudicial to the Empire, &s;hould he at the &s;ame time be engaged in a War again&s;t the <HI>Turk,</HI> whil&s;t as dangerous a friend as the other was an Enemy, crept ea&s;ily into a &s;u&s;pected Neighbourhood. But the other Chri&s;tian Princes, e&s;pecially <HI>Rome,</HI> and the Allies, engaged in the <HI>Venetian</HI> Quarrel, perceiving the Emperor to de|tract from his re&s;olutions of War, upon this &s;u|&s;picion, endeavoured to clear him from all jea|lou&s;ie in reference to the <HI>French</HI> de&s;igns, and for better evidence thereof, had their own engage|ments &s;econded by Prote&s;tations from that King, not only not to mole&s;t the Empire during this War, but to afford him con&s;iderable aid and a&s;&s;i|&s;tance both in Men, and Money. The&s;e Nego|tiations and incitements to a War, encouraged the Emperor, and the <HI>German</HI> Princes in that manner, that whil&s;t the <HI>Turks</HI> expected the re|turn of the Currier from <HI>Vienna,</HI> as it were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> an Oliver Branch of Peace, and Confirma|tion of all Articles, which before were e&s;teemed to be concluded, and agreed; the Scene was wholly changed, and the Letters contained new demands and propo&s;itions, and in fine, made all doubtful and un&s;atisfactory. The <HI>Turks</HI> penetrating rightly into this Affair, pre&s;&s;ed hard to have a &s;peedy Peace, or War; wherefore the <HI>Reis Effen|di,</HI> or Secretary of State, did at a private Conference with the <HI>German</HI> Mini&s;ter in name of the G. Sig|nior, and in few words declare, That three months were allotted to demoli&s;h the Fort built by the Count <HI>Serini,</HI> and for coming of an extraordinary Amba&s;&s;ador to confirm the Articles: Notwith|&s;tanding which, the Grand Signior unmindful of the time, and of the Conditions he had given, and prefixed for Peace, ordered the Vizier im|mediately to prepare for the War, declaring that he would in Per&s;on accompany him in part of his March, and remove his Court to <HI>Adrianople;</HI> for this being a Country, champian, and plain, full of Game of all &s;orts, &s;o drew the heart and de|light of the Grand Signior, that his Seraglio at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> &s;eemed as a Cage, or Pri&s;on, in re|&s;pect of tho&s;e de&s;ired Plains of <HI>Thrace:</HI> His Wo|men were no pa&s;time or recreation to him, in who&s; Apartments he &s;pent little time: For this exce&s;&s;ive humour in Hunting made him daily to pre&s;s the Vizier to depart for <HI>Adrianople,</HI> not that he had &s;o real a de&s;ire to the War, as he had to his Game; which gave occa&s;ion to that ordinary Saying among&s;t the Turks, <HI>That the Grand Sig|nior had left &s;ome Hares behind him at</HI> Adrianople, <HI>and would return to &s;eek them.</HI> At length the Vizier not longer able to re&s;i&s;t his importunity without his di&s;plea&s;ure, &s;ummon'd a Council of all the Viziers of the Bench, where al&s;o the Jani&s;ar Aga was pre&s;ent, to con&s;ult concerning the time of their departure, at which they unanimou&s;ly con|cluded, that for divers Rea&s;ons, it was mo&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;ary to defer this expedition until the next Spring. Fir&s;t, Becau&s;e that three months time were already given to the Emperor for &s;ending his Extraordinary Amba&s;&s;ador. Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Rea|&s;on why the <HI>Turks</HI> deferred the War with the <HI>German.</HI></NOTE> Be|cau&s;e in &s;o &s;hort a time, Provi&s;ions could not be &s;ent into tho&s;e Parts for relief of the Camp. Thirdly, Becau&s;e the Souldiers which were abroad could not have timely notice to repair to their Colours. Fourthly, Be|cau&s;e many Souldiers had begun to rebuild their hou&s;es de&s;troyed by the late Fires, which by the Spring they might &s;ee fini&s;hed. And la&s;tly, That the Summer being now almo&s;t &s;pent, was not &s;o fit for action, as the Spring, which gives new life and blood to men, as well as &s;ap and moi&s;ture unto Vegetables. The&s;e Rea&s;ons being repre|&s;ented with all humility to the Grand Signior, he &s;eemed to re&s;t &s;atisfied, and his heat of vi|&s;iting <HI>Adrianople</HI> for the pre&s;ent allayed. And in the mean time, that the de&s;ign again&s;t <HI>Ger|many</HI> might be the more covertly carried, it was given out that the preparations were intended again&s;t the <HI>Venetian</HI> Territories in <HI>Dalmatia, (viz.) Zara, Sebenico,</HI> and <HI>Cataro,</HI> and Pro|clamation was made that all Souldiers &s;hould prepare them&s;elves for the Wars again&s;t the next Spring. In which Interim no accident interve|ning which might bring matters to an accom|modation and better under&s;tanding, the daily Skirmi&s;hes on the Frontiers made the Contro|ver&s;ie every day more difficult to be reconciled, and the breach the wider.

<P>This Letter was received by His Maje&s;ties Amba&s;&s;ador with that humanity as was agreeable to his Noble Nature; and with that &s;en&s;e of the Chri&s;tian Cau&s;e as became a Religious Mini&s;ter of the Faith's Defender, and an An&s;wer returned thereunto full of affectionate Piety and Compa&s;|&s;ion. But it was feared that the time was elap|&s;ed, and the Di&s;ea&s;e proceeded too far to admit a gentle Cure; for it could not probably be ex|pected, that the Vizier &s;hould, upon fair words or per&s;wa&s;ions, or by the force of pa&s;&s;ionate and Rhetorical expre&s;&s;ions, be induced to let &s;lip the
<PB N="122" REF="65">fair opportunity of an intire and total &s;ubjection of <HI>Tran&s;ilvania.</HI> And the truth is, herein lay the ground of the great Quarral between the&s;e two Emperors; for ever &s;ince the Defeat of <HI>Chimianus</HI> (or as the <HI>Tran&s;ilvanians</HI> call him <HI>Kemenius</HI>) the <HI>Turk</HI> &s;wallowing in his thoughts the intire &s;ubje|ction of that Country, de&s;igned to reduce it to the Government of a Pa&s;ha, rather than of a Chri|&s;tian Prince, though elected at the <HI>Ottomon</HI> Port; and in order thereunto, advanced beyond the Li|mits of the ancient bounds, and pitched his Camp in the very Bowels of the Country. The&s;e pro|ceedings giving matter of jealou&s;ie to all the Cap|tains of the bordering Chri&s;tians; the Count <HI>Serini</HI> fir&s;t ha&s;tned the fini&s;hing of his fort, as much as was po&s;&s;ible; and next, according to his exam|ple, the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> in all parts of the Borders for|tified their Towns and Ca&s;tles, and reinforced their Gari&s;ons; which was an&s;wered by the <HI>Turks</HI> in the like preparations. And thus mutual fears and jealou&s;ies effected that ill Corre&s;pon|dence, in which the State of Affairs then remain|ed.</P>
<P>And &s;ince <HI>Tran&s;ilvania</HI> is the pre&s;ent Scene of Action, it will not be much from our purpo&s;e to digre&s;s a little in declaring the &s;tate of that mi&s;e|rable Principality, and by what ways and means the <HI>Turks</HI> encrea&s;ed their Tribute, and encroach|ed on their Liberties; the which Relation I re|ceived from one of the <HI>Tran&s;ilvanian</HI> Agents, to this effect.</P>
<P>In the time of <HI>Sultan Solyman,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Hi&s;tory of <HI>Tran&s;il|vanian</HI> Mi&s;ery.</NOTE> <HI>Tran&s;ilvania</HI> was governed by her own Laws, and her natural Prince, paying then only Thirty Thou&s;and Dol|lars of yearly Tribute. After which <HI>Ali</HI> Pa&s;ha taking <HI>Varadin</HI> on the Frontiers, had &s;ome part of the Country alloted him for maintenance of his Gari&s;on, and at that time &s;olemnly &s;wore, That beyond tho&s;e Limits allotted to <HI>Varadin,</HI> the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;hould not farther enter into <HI>Tran&s;ilvania,</HI> but that Oath being little regarded, they have &s;ince that time po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of &s;ix Provinces, <HI>(viz.) Bichar, Doboka, Halnock, Colos,</HI> in which is <HI>Clau|diopolis,</HI> and of the be&s;t part of <HI>Zarand.</HI> Nor were the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;atisfied herewith, but in the year 1658. the Vizier <HI>Kuperlee</HI> entered <HI>Tran&s;ilvania,</HI> and by force of Arms took the &s;trong Town of <HI>Janova,</HI> and demanded the Surrender of <HI>Lugas</HI> and <HI>Karan&s;ebes</HI> into his hands. Nor could the allegations of the Oath of <HI>Sultan Solyman,</HI> or of <HI>Ali</HI> Pa&s;ha, or any other per&s;wa&s;ions or &s;ubmi&s;&s;i|on induce him to moderate any part of his &s;evere demands, until fir&s;t having mi&s;erably de&s;troyed the whole Country, and &s;atiated him&s;elf with blood, he was contented, upon the &s;ad and humble &s;upplication of the amba&s;&s;ador from that Prince, to withdraw his Army out of <HI>Tran&s;ilva|nia,</HI> on condition that Fifty thou&s;and Dollars of yearly Tribute &s;hould be added to the former Thirty thou&s;and, and that <HI>Lugas</HI> and <HI>Karan&s;ebes</HI> &s;hould be wholly abandoned by the native Inha|bitants, and deliverd into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Turk:</HI> And as a mark of his ab&s;olute Dominion over that Country, he forced one <HI>Achacius Barcley,</HI> em|ployed before as Amba&s;&s;ador to him, to take on him the Government, threatning that if he ac|cepted not of the Charge, he would inve&s;t a Car|ter in the Principality: Notwith&s;tanding all this Treatment; and though the <HI>Tran&s;ilvanians</HI> com|ply'd with all the propo&s;itions offered them by the <HI>Turk,</HI> yet not long after the <HI>Tartar Han</HI> pa&s;&s;ed twice through the Country, mi&s;erably harra&s;&s;ing, &s;poiling, and killing, or making Cap|tives all he met, who&s;e departure al&s;o from this Country was purcha&s;ed with a con&s;iderable Sum of Money. And this was the &s;tate of the mi&s;ery of <HI>Tran&s;ilvania,</HI> when the troubles rai&s;ed by <HI>Ra|gotzki</HI> and <HI>Kemenius</HI> added to the other di&s;con|tents, and admini&s;tred farther occa&s;ion to the en|&s;uing War.</P>
<P>But whil&s;t the thoughts of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Court were intent on their preparation for the next years War in <HI>Hungary,</HI> advice came that the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Fleet, con&s;i&s;ting of Seventeen Ships, and Thirty &s;even Saiques, lately departed from <HI>Con|&s;tantinople</HI> bound for <HI>Alexandria</HI> in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and convoyed by &s;ix Gallies, which met them at <HI>Scio,</HI> very rich with Money, and other goods, (who&s;e returns are yearly for the mo&s;t part made in Su|gar, Coffee, Rice, and other Commodities) were encountred near <HI>Rhodes</HI> by the <HI>Venetian</HI> Ar|mata, and &s;uch ruine and prize made of them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Alex|andrian</HI> Fleet en|countred by the <HI>Ve|netians.</HI></NOTE> that of the Three&s;core Sail, Twenty eight Saiques, &amp; 4 Ships were &s;unk and taken: <HI>(viz.)</HI> 18 Saiques taken, &amp; 10 burnt, 3 Ships taken, and one burnt, and thereon Two hundred and &s;eventy Slaves, among which there were of note, <HI>Arnout A&s;an Aga,</HI> Eunuch of the Seraglio, <HI>Mahomet Aga, Ba&s;|cut Aga&s;ey</HI> of <HI>Grand Cairo,</HI> and <HI>Emin Reis,</HI> Cap|tain of a Ship. When this news arrived, I hap|pened to be at the Viziers Court, and perceived a &s;trange di&s;turbance and alteration in the faces of all then pre&s;ent; but more particularly the Grand Signior &s;eemed to be heated with fury, and pre|&s;ent re&s;olution of revenge; &s;o that he had almo&s;t forgotten his de&s;igns again&s;t the Emperor; and quitting his pa&s;time in Hunting, he began to talk of tran&s;porting his Arms into <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> and there|upon &s;ent Orders to one <HI>Beco</HI> a Begh of the <HI>Mo|rea</HI> to cau&s;e a &s;urvey of the High-ways, Pa&s;&s;ages, and Bridges towards <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> as if he had in|tended immediately to march, and either to de|fer his <HI>Hungarian</HI> War, or wage both at the &s;ame time. But his graver, and more &s;ober Council mo|derated his heat with Rea&s;on, knowing that the de|&s;igns of Princes, though never &s;o ab&s;olute, mu&s;t be &s;ubject to times and &s;ea&s;ons, until their Pow|ers can extend to Omnipotency, which never yet could exceed the abilities of a mortal man, though &s;ome have affected Divine Honours, and by Flatterers have been ranked after death in the number of the Gods. The <HI>Venetians</HI> lo&s;t Seventy men only, or thereabouts, and among&s;t them <HI>Giacomo Semitecolo,</HI> a noble <HI>Venetian,</HI> with other Braves and Souldiers of Fortune. The <HI>Turks</HI> hor|ribly touched with this lo&s;s and di&s;grace, e&s;pe|cially the Grand Signior, who had an Intere&s;t in the <HI>Caravana,</HI> had a mind to vent &s;ome of their fury on Signior <HI>Ballarino,</HI> the <HI>Venetian</HI> Mini&s;ter to the Port, like tho&s;e (as we &s;ay) who can|not beat the Hor&s;e, will beat the Saddle; &s;o that they intended to impri&s;on him again in &s;ome dark Cell, or ob&s;cure retirement, of which, or of &s;ome other rigor Signior <HI>Ballarino</HI> was &s;o &s;en&s;ible, that he wrote this en&s;uing Letter to the Senator <HI>Nico|lo Contarini,</HI> which may &s;erve to explain the angui&s;h and &s;orrowful apprehen&s;ions of his Soul.</P>

I hold the Helm of the Ship as direct as I can, but the adver&s;e Waves of my Fortune drive me into the mid&s;t of tho&s;e Storms where I ap|prehend the greate&s;t Dangers: I am here in the mid&s;t of the Sea, which is the Ne&s;t of Extravagancies, the grand belief of unthought of Accidents, the &s;pacious Theatre of Trage|dies, a fierce Giant, a horrible Mon&s;ter, who with gentle <HI>Opiates</HI> endeavonrs to lull a&s;leep, and lead tho&s;e to De&s;truction who have too great a confidence in their own Strength. I reproach my &s;elf for not having been able to make it &s;ufficiently under&s;tood, how one &s;troke of adver&s;e Fortune is capable to put all into Danger, who are imbarked in the &s;ame Ve&s;|&s;el; And as little able am I to inculcate into the minds of Men, that whil&s;t the Waves of the va&s;t Sea are &s;mooth and calm, the nearer is the raging of the Waters, and the fury of a Tempe&s;t. It was therefore nece&s;&s;ary that there &s;hould have been &s;ome more skilful Pilot than my &s;elf to conduct this Ve&s;&s;el. I was long &s;ince acquainted with my Imperfections, and therefore called aloud for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of an abler Pilot, to direct me in this tempe&s;tu|ous Region; but &s;ince I was not heard, I glo|ried at lea&s;t to be alone in this Gulf, that be|ing &s;wallowed up by a final Ruin, my Martyr|dom may be a means to &s;ave the re&s;t. Rains and Lightnings do not affright me, but rather &s;erve to quench that fire of Di&s;dain which I conceive again&s;t my &s;elf, for not knowing how to perform better, and &s;erve to enlighten me daily to find out that Compa&s;s or Cart which may direct me to a cour&s;e or path of Security. I fear Thunders and Tempe&s;ts, becau&s;e the violence of one, and the hardne&s;s of the other is able to render a cold Sweat mixed with Blood altogether unprofitable. This mi&s;erable School, tho of eleven Tears continuance, con|&s;trains me to &s;tudy the Di&s;po&s;ition of the Stars, the Signs in the Air, the Ebbings and Flowings of the Waters, concealed Rocks, the Dangers of a long Voyage, and the nece&s;&s;ity of recover|ing a Port. I have &s;tudied indeed, but I fear I have not well learned this profound Di&s;cipline; for where there is the greate&s;t ur|gency, there I have gathered the lea&s;t Fruit; for &s;ince the A&s;pect of the Spheres are become more inau&s;picious, I am doubtful that I &s;hall &s;ee the Ship beaten with &s;welling Surges, and being full of Water, it will be &s;o far from being ea&s;ed by tho&s;e opportune Remedies which I bring, that it will rather be encrea&s;ed by my Tears. God grant by his miraculous Pro|vidence, the Tranquillity which we de&s;ire, and which by humune means will be difficult to ob|tain. I had not the under&s;tanding to take Opportunity by the Foretop when She pre&s;ent|ed her &s;elf unto me with gentle and benign Appearance, &s;howing me the means to &s;ave this floating Ve&s;&s;el, and &s;pare our in&s;idious rewards. For this Rea&s;on my dejected, but not conquered mind, makes my very Bowels feel an unu&s;ual angui&s;h of an over-troubled E&s;tate. May it plea&s;e the Divine pity, that the&s;e my Afflictions may prove the Off-&s;pring of my own vilene&s;s, but not the means of my Ruin. I tru&s;t therein, I confe&s;s, and yet frail hope, amid&s;t this Gulf of Sin, induces me to expect doubtful Succe&s;&s;es; Yet certainly I will endeavour to avoid a &s;hipwrack on tho&s;e Rocks of De&s;pair; And &s;o imploring the Patronage of your Excellency here on Earth, I confirm my &s;elf.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>This Letter &s;eems to be wrote in the &s;tile of a de&s;pairing Per&s;on; yet if it be well con&s;idered, the meaning is no other than what the I&s;&s;ue of Affairs &s;ome years afterwards did evidence; and his In|tentions were no other than to de&s;cribe the ill na|ture of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ters, and their ob&s;tinacy of continuing a War, until they had wearied out the <HI>Venetians</HI> into an Humour of &s;urrendring the whole I&s;land of <HI>Candia</HI> unto them. I had the Honour to be well acquainted with the Per&s;on of Signior <HI>Ballarino,</HI> and I always e&s;teemed him in his external Behaviour accompli&s;hed with the Exce&s;&s;es of <HI>Italian</HI> Civility; he was endued with great fluency of Language, both in Di&s;cour&s;e and Writing; he was Jealous, Acute and Wary; and in &s;hort, was a proper Mini&s;ter for that Re|publick, well practiced and ver&s;ed in the manner of Treaty with the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Court. He at fir&s;t was &s;ent from <HI>Venice</HI> to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> in quality of Secretary to the Excellenti&s;&s;imo <HI>Capello,</HI> Pro|curator of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> a Per&s;on eminent for his Office, and the &s;everal great employments which he had exerci&s;ed in that State; he was &s;incere, and of a generous Soul; his comely Looks, and grave Habit &s;poke him to be a Gentleman, and a Senator. In &s;hort, he was &s;o well e&s;temeed of at <HI>Venice,</HI> that he was thought worthy to be imployed in this Emba&s;&s;y to the Grand Signior, which is commonly granted to Per&s;ons after they have run through all Services of the Commonwealth, as a Con&s;ummation of their Honours and Riche&s;s. This Gentleman then had the misfortune to be inve&s;ted in this Honour in the wor&s;t of Times, when the War was broke forth, and being there|by expo&s;ed to their cruelty, he was put into Pri|&s;on, where pa&s;&s;ing for &s;ome time a Life of Sor|row and Sadne&s;s, he fell into a Melancholly, which repre&s;ented all things to him in the black|e&s;t manner; &s;o that, I know not why his fancy &s;ugge&s;ted to him, that he was not only mi&s;erable in his Impri&s;onment and Re&s;traint among&s;t the <HI>Turks,</HI> but that he was fallen al&s;o into di&s;grace, and di&s;plea&s;ure of his Prince at home. I will not &s;ay that Signior <HI>Ballarino</HI> did nouri&s;h the Opera|tion of this black humour in him; but I have heard that he did not admini&s;ter that comfort to him, as might &s;erve to di&s;pel the thickne&s;s of that Vapour which ob&s;cured the generous temper of his Soul. In &s;hort, he gave &s;uch way to this melancholly, that he laid violent hands upon him&s;elf (as we have &s;aid before); but afterwards by the Care of his Friends and Servants, being cured of his wounds, he lived &s;ome years after, by his Sorrows and Repentance for it, to give Sati&s;|faction to God and the World. How&s;oever, the Senate being informed thereof, and judging this Act to be the effect of a violent Phren&s;y, appoint|ed
<PB N="124" REF="66"><HI>Ballarino</HI> to take on him&s;elf the intire manage|ment of Affairs, re&s;erving only the Title and Ho|nour to Signior <HI>Capello. Ballarino</HI> now manage|ing all Affairs, <HI>Capello</HI> looked on him&s;elf as neg|lected and laid a&s;ide, how&s;oever comported his Condition with Submi&s;&s;ion and Gentlene&s;s, never openly re&s;enting the Honours of <HI>Ballarino,</HI> or to &s;ee him preferred before him&s;elf; How&s;oever, &s;e|cretly nouri&s;hing an inward Di&s;content, his ro|bu&s;tious Nature, upwards of eighty years of Age, was forced to give way to its final Di&s;&s;olution; and falling Sick, he &s;ent to the Earl of <HI>Winchel&s;ea,</HI> then Amba&s;&s;ador for his Maje&s;ty at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> to acquaint him of his Di&s;temper, de&s;iring him to &s;end me, who was then his Secretary, unto him. At the&s;e Summons I was ea&s;ily per&s;waded to go, having always had his Per&s;on in great Reverence; and being come to his Bed-&s;ide, he rai&s;ed him&s;elf upon his Pillows, and embracing me in his Arms, I fancied my &s;elf to receive the Benediction of one of the Ancient Patriarchs. He began with a weak Voice to &s;ay to me, Sir, I am near my end, ex|pecting every Minute to render up my la&s;t Breath, and therefore as a dying man, I de&s;ire of your Ma&s;ter, the Amba&s;&s;ador, that &s;o &s;oon as I am dead, he would be plea&s;ed to deliver this poor Carca&s;s of mine from under the covering of this accur&s;ed Roof. For An&s;wer whereunto I did not &s;tand to expo&s;tulate the Rea&s;ons with him, well knowing the cau&s;e of his di&s;content; but that I would communicate his de&s;ires to my Lord Am|ba&s;&s;ador, and &s;peedily return with my An&s;wer to him. Accordingly I departed from him, and quickly brought from my Lord a Promi&s;e to en|deavour his utmo&s;t to comply with his reque&s;t; at which he &s;eemed to be much &s;atisfied, and commanded his Servants then pre&s;ent, e&s;pecially one called Sig. <HI>Toma&s;o Gobbato,</HI> his great confident, to be Witne&s;&s;es thereof. The next day he expired his la&s;t Breath, and the day following his Body being embalmed, his bowels were buried, and the Funeral Rites performed with &s;uch order and decency as was &s;eemly in a Country where he lived rather like a Pri&s;oner than an Amba&s;&s;ador. All things being thus prepared, the Earl of <HI>Win|chel&s;ea,</HI> according to the Will of the Decea&s;ed, &s;ent for his Body, already embalmed, which was immediately without oppo&s;ition or &s;cruple &s;ent to his hou&s;e; where it remained for &s;ome months, in expectation of a conveyance for <HI>Ve|nice.</HI> At length a Dutch &s;hip, being bound from <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> thither, it was de&s;igned that the Body &s;hould be thereon imbarked; but I know not for what rea&s;on, the Cu&s;tomer refu&s;ed to &s;uffer it to pa&s;s; though it may well and rational|ly be conjectured, That <HI>Ballarino,</HI> who was &s;en|&s;ibly touched to have the care of the Body of his Ma&s;ter, his Countryman and Colleague taken from him, did with Pre&s;ents prevail with the Cu&s;tomer to put difficulties in the way which he &s;uppo&s;ed might vex tho&s;e who were thought worthy of this employment. This oppo&s;ition being made, and not to be overcome without much Money, it was contrived that the Ship departing &s;hould attend the Corps at <HI>Tenedos,</HI> which was without the command of the Ca&s;tles; and the body being divided from the Legs, was packed up in a But of Cavear, and &s;o &s;ent down by a boat with Licence of the Cu&s;tomer, as a parcel of Goods and Mer|chandice; and &s;o &s;afely arriving aboard, the Corps were &s;eparated from their adjuncts; and being laid decently in a Coffin, covered with a Pall of black Velvet, with Scutcheons, and other orna|ments appertaining to the Funerals of &s;uch great Per&s;onages, it arrived &s;afely at <HI>Venice,</HI> where it was interred with the u&s;ual ceremonies, in the Tomb of the Ance&s;tors of that Ancient Fa|mily.</P>
<P>But the heads and thoughts of the&s;e Governours were not &s;o employed in their preparations of War, but that the Vizier could lend an ear to the &s;ugge&s;tions of &s;ome malicious Phari&s;ees, who, un|der pretence of Religion, informed him, That the Chri&s;tian Churches, burnt down in <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople</HI> and <HI>Galata</HI> by tho&s;e dreadful Fires in the year 1660, were again re-edified again&s;t his com|mand, and the Law of the <HI>Turks,</HI> which allows the reparation of Churches, and continuance of &s;uch which were found &s;tanding when <HI>Mohometani&s;m</HI> was introduced; but not to erect new, or re|build what are either by time, fire, or other ac|cidents fallen to ruine. And being farther informed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Vi|zier de|&s;troys the Chri&s;tian Churches rebuilt af|ter the Fire.</NOTE> that though tho&s;e Churches were re&s;tored under the notion of Dwellings, or Ware-hou&s;es, yet &s;e|cretly &s;erved for Celebration of Divine Service, and thereby his Decrees and Edicts were fru&s;trated and di&s;appointed: Wherefore, furiou&s;ly tran&s;port|ed with a <HI>Mahometan</HI> Zeal, commanded immediate|ly that the Authors of tho&s;e Buildings &s;hould be impri&s;oned, the Churches them&s;elves levelled to the Foundation, and the ground whereon they &s;tood confi&s;cated to the Grand Signior. This action, though naturally agreeable to the di&s;po&s;ition of the Vizier, who was a perfect <HI>Turk,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Zeal of a <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Preacher.</NOTE> zealous in execu|tion of all points of the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Law, being e|ducated after the &s;evere&s;t &s;ort of Profe&s;&s;ors, and one of tho&s;e whom they called Softaes; yet he was chiefly prompted unto this, and to a greater abhor|rency of Chri&s;tianity, by one <HI>Vanni Effendi,</HI> a Shegh, or Preacher, one who was as inveterate and mali|cious to the Chri&s;tian Religion, as any <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;t</HI> or Fanatick is to the Rites of our Church and Religi|on. And thus we may &s;ee how trouble&s;om Hy|pocri&s;ie and <HI>Puritani&s;m</HI> are in all places where they gain a Superiority; for this Preacher not con|tented only to ruine the Chri&s;tian Churches, but per&s;waded the Vizier that the terrible Fires in <HI>Con|&s;tantinople</HI> and <HI>Galata</HI> in the year 1660, and the la&s;t years unparallel'd Pe&s;tilence, and the incon|&s;iderable advance of the <HI>Turks</HI> on the Chri&s;tians for &s;ome years, were &s;o many parts of Divine Judgments thrown on the Mu&s;&s;ulmen or Believers, in vengeance of their too much Licence given to the Chri&s;tian Religion, permitting Wine to be &s;old within the Walls of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> which polluted the Imperial City, &amp; en&s;nared the faithful by tem|ptation to what was unlawful: Wherefore a com|mand was i&s;&s;ued, That no Wine &s;hould be hence|forth &s;old within the Walls of the City. And it was farther intended, that <HI>Greeks</HI> &amp; <HI>Armenians,</HI> &amp; all other Chri&s;tians, who had Dwellings or Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions with|in the Walls of the City, &s;hould within Forty days &s;ell tho&s;e habitations, and depart; which other|wi&s;e &s;hould be confi&s;cated to the Grand Signior; but God who &s;upports the Faithful in Tryals of Per&s;ecution, moderated this Decree, and re&s;erved &s;till this Church in the mid&s;t of Infidels; not &s;uf|fering this City to lo&s;e the Name nor Religion of that holy Emperor, who both erected, and chri&s;t|ned it; as al&s;o to pre&s;erve mo&s;t of the Churches, which though again uncovered, yet were redeem|ed for Money from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Turks.</HI> Nor was the <HI>Mohometan</HI> Zeal &s;atisfied in Demoli&s;h|ment of the Churches them&s;elves, unle&s;s it vented part of its fury again&s;t the poor Workmen, which for their hire and days Wages erected them; &s;uch as <HI>Greek</HI> Labourers, Ma&s;ons, and Carpen|ters, who were all beaten and impri&s;oned. But it happening at that time that the Queen Mother building a &s;umptuous Mo&s;ch, and having occa&s;ion of many Labourers and Arti&s;ts to forward &s;o va&s;t a Work, &s;ent to the Maimarba&s;hee (who is
<PB N="125" REF="66">the Ma&s;ter work-man, or Cape, over all &s;uch who are employed in Building) to &s;up|ply &s;uch a number of Carpenters, Ma&s;ons, and others, as were convenient to carry on that Fabrick with expedition; who readily replyed, That he would provide all that was po&s;&s;ible, but could not promi&s;e a &s;ufficient number, unle&s;s tho&s;e <HI>Greeks</HI> were &s;et at liberty, who were im|pri&s;oned by the Grand Vizier for building the Chri&s;tian Churches; which an&s;wer being reported again to the Queen Mother, &s;he interceded with the Vizier in their behalf, who being glad of any occa&s;ion to gratifie to great a Lady, immediately relea&s;ed them, without any fine or reward, which he de&s;igned to obtain for their li|berty. How&s;oever the Vizier not well brook|ing &s;uch an indignity (as he &s;uppo&s;ed) put upon him by &s;o mean a Slave, as the Maimarba|&s;hee, dealt with &s;ome of the impri&s;oned Labou|rers to accu&s;e him, as the Author and Licen&s;er of building the Chri&s;tian Churches. The <HI>Greeks</HI> ea&s;ily enough per&s;waded to plea&s;e &s;o great a Per|&s;onage, accu&s;ed him accordingly, who&s;e Evi|dence, though nor pa&s;&s;able again&s;t a <HI>Turk</HI> by the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Law, yet &s;erved the Viziers revenge for the pre&s;ent, who immediately commanded his head to be &s;truck off,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Vi|ziers re|venge on the Cape of the Builders.</NOTE> and his E&s;tate confi&s;|cated; which was reported to con&s;i&s;t of Two thou&s;and Pur&s;es of Money, every Pur&s;e import|ing Five hundred Dollars, then found actually in his Hou&s;e, which, if true, is a &s;trange Wealth for &s;o ordinary a Per&s;on. But by this, and by many other in&s;tances, we may perceive that there is no People in the World more covetous and de&s;irous to ama&s;s Wealth than the <HI>Turks,</HI> nor none more uncertain to enjoy it.</P>
<P>About this time the <HI>French</HI> Merchants in the <HI>Le|vant,</HI> having advi&s;ed his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty that the <HI>Turks</HI> were &s;en&s;ible that the affront to the Per&s;on of <HI>Mon&s;ieur la Haye,</HI> his Amba&s;&s;ador, was contrary to the Law of Nations, and &s;uch an injury as could not but provoke the Choler of &s;o pui&s;|&s;ant a Prince to a ju&s;t revenge; and knowing that his Maje&s;ty being powerful at Sea, was able to extend his Arms to the utmo&s;t Confines of his Empire, whil&s;t the interpo&s;ition of other Coun|tries limited the <HI>Turks</HI> march by Land, and their ignorance and inability in Marine Affairs rendred them uncapable to arrive tho&s;e Banks of <HI>France,</HI> which the Sea wa&s;hes: The&s;e Con&s;iderations the <HI>French</HI> Merchants having per&s;waded the King to be the thoughts of the Grand Signior, and that he de&s;ired the continuance of the Peace and Traf|fick with <HI>France,</HI> and as an evidence of his re|mor&s;e and di&s;plea&s;ure for the injury to Mon&s;ieur <HI>la Haye,</HI> the Father, his Maje&s;ty was contented in &s;atisfaction thereof to redre&s;s this injurious tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the Law of Nations, by &s;ome ex|traordinary marks of favour and honour to the Per&s;on of Mon&s;ieur <HI>la Haye</HI> the Son; that &s;o ex|ceeding the u&s;ual method and rule of Ceremony towards this Amba&s;&s;ador at his arrival, the World might be convinced of the real affection, and hearty de&s;ire the Grand Signior had to renew his Peace, and pre&s;erve his Commerce with <HI>France.</HI> This is &s;uppo&s;ed to be what the Mer|chants of <HI>Mar&s;eille</HI> and <HI>Lyons,</HI> governed by the Intere&s;t of their Trade, &s;ugge&s;ted to their King, to induce him to &s;end an Amba&s;&s;ador to <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> for at this time Mon&s;ieur <HI>Roboli,</HI> a Merchant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Me&s;&s;en|gers from <HI>France</HI> to introduce a new Am|ba&s;&s;ador.</NOTE> remained only as Con&s;ul or Agent for the Affairs of Commerce.

But this Negotiation about a <HI>French</HI> Am|ba&s;&s;ador took not effect, until &s;ome time after, in which other Letters and Me&s;&s;ages intervened, as will appear by the following Sequel of this Hi|&s;tory.</P>
<P>It was now towards the beginning of Winter, when the Sea&s;on of the Year compelled the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Fleet of Gallies to return according to cu&s;tom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The re|turn of the <HI>Turk|i&s;h</HI> Arma|ta to win|ter at <HI>Con|&s;tanti|nople.</HI></NOTE> to the Port of <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> The whole Sum|mer before, they had for the mo&s;t part pa&s;&s;ed in &s;ome Harbour or Creek among&s;t the <HI>Greek</HI> I&s;lands, having afforded nothing of Convoy or &s;uccour to|wards the &s;afe Conduct of the Fleet of <HI>Grand Cairo,</HI> but &s;uffered them to fall into the hands of the Enemy, as before mentioned, and indeed for &s;everal years the Marine Affairs of the <HI>Turks</HI> have always gone decaying in Fame and Force; and the preparations of the Armata every Spring, have been of Form and Cour&s;e, rather than with hopes of &s;ucce&s;s corre&s;pondent to the expence. In their return home, near <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople</HI> they encountred a fierce &s;torm, &s;o that three Gallies were ca&s;t away at <HI>Ponte Piccolo,</HI> (by the <HI>Turks</HI> called <HI>Cucuccheckmage,</HI> about four Leagues di&s;tant from <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI>) How&s;oever the Wea|ther clearing, the remainder of the Fleet got into Port, entring with Joy, with Vollies of great and &s;mall Shot, with Streamers flying, Pipes &s;ounding, and all other &s;orts of their Country Mu&s;ick, bringing with great O&s;tenta|tion a &s;mall Flyboat, which had been a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">or|ne&s;e Man of War, taken by them as &s;he was crui&s;ing &s;ingly in the Arches of <HI>Pelago;</HI> which was brought in with &s;o much Ceremony u&s;ed in toaing her into Port, decking her with Streamers and Pendants, with &s;uch &s;igns of Vi|ctory and Triumph, as if they had led Cap|tive the whole <HI>Venetian</HI> Armata.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Slaves make an In&s;ur|rection in one of the Beghs Gallies.</NOTE> But I mu&s;t not omit the relation of what be&s;el one of the Beghs Gallies, de&s;igned, with the re&s;t, to ren|dezvous at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> whil&s;t &s;he loitered among&s;t &s;mall I&s;les in the Gulf of <HI>Nicomedia.</HI> It was a Gally, the Commander of which had newly received as the Portion of his Wite, being a Young man lately married. who entertained great thoughts of rai&s;ing his Fortunes by the &s;poils and prize he was to make.

Tho&s;e on the &s;hore admiring at the unexpected depar|ture of the Gally, accompanied her with their Eyes and wonder as far as they could perceive her in &s;ight, but ob&s;erving her to &s;teer a dif|ferent cour&s;e from the Port, to which they were de&s;igned, &s;u&s;pected much of the truth of what had &s;ucceeded; wherefore taking their Boat im|mediately, they ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">tned to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> to give advice of what had pa&s;&s;ed, that (if po&s;&s;ible) Orders might timely arrive the Ca&s;tles on the Helle&s;pont, which might ob&s;truct their farther pa&s;&s;age. But alas! the poor Slaves were &s;o di&s;|mayed with their own action, and &s;o tran|&s;ported with a &s;lavi&s;h fear and apprehen&s;ion of what might &s;ucced, &s;hould their e&s;cape not be effected; that they knew not what cour&s;e to &s;teer: All things &s;eemed to contradict their li|berty, the Wind proved contrary, their Spirits dejected, their under&s;tandings void of coun&s;el and contrivance; &s;o that wand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ing three or four days in the <HI>Propentis,</HI> at la&s;t ran their Gally a&s;hoar on the <HI>A&s;ian</HI> &s;ide, near <HI>Palermo,</HI> from whence they were brought back to <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople,</HI> and there, by &s;entence of the Captain Pa|&s;ha, fourteen of them had their Legs and Arms broken, and &s;o &s;uffered to die in that torture, and afterwards their Bodies were thrown into
<PB N="128" REF="68">the Sea, to the terrour of all other Slaves, who prefer a mi&s;erable Life at the Oar, before the torments of &s;ome hours in dying.</P>
<P>Though the <HI>Turks</HI> have their Affairs but ill ma|naged at Sea, and their &s;ucce&s;s accordingly for|tunate; yet their preparation for Land &s;ervices are more expedite, and executed with that &s;e|cre&s;y and &s;peed, that oftentimes Armies are brought into the Field, before it is &s;o much as rumoured by common Mouths that any de&s;igns are in agitation: For though it was now Win|ter, yet the de&s;ign again&s;t <HI>Germany</HI> went for|ward, Forces were daily &s;ent to the Frontiers, Cannot, and Ammunition for War, tran&s;ported by way of the black Sea, and the <HI>Danube.</HI> Or|ders i&s;&s;ued out to the Princes of <HI>Moldavia</HI> and <HI>Valachia</HI> to repair their Wharfs and Keys along the River,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pre|parations for the <HI>German</HI> War.</NOTE> for the more convenient landing of Men and Ammunition, and to rebuild their Bridges for the more commodious pa&s;&s;age of the <HI>Tartars;</HI> that Hor&s;es &s;hould be provided again&s;t the next Spring, for drawing all Carriages of Ammunition, and Provi&s;ions; their Magazines &s;tored with quantities of Bread, and Rice, their Fields well &s;tocked with Sheep, and other Cat|tel, and that no nece&s;&s;aries be wanting which concern the victualling, or &s;u&s;tenance of a Camp. The <HI>Tartars</HI> were appointed to have in a readi|ne&s;s a Hundred thou&s;and Hor&s;emen, to make In|cur&s;ions on the Frontiers; likewi&s;e the Pa&s;haws of <HI>Darbiquier, Aleppo, Caramania,</HI> and <HI>Anatolia</HI> received their orders; and &s;even and twenty Let|ters, accompanied with as many Ve&s;ts, after the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> manner, were &s;ent to as many Pa&s;haws of the Empire, to di&s;po&s;e the &s;trength of their Coun|tries in a Warlike po&s;ture, &s;o as to march when the Grand Signiors Commands &s;hould re|quire them to attend his de&s;igns: And that the occa&s;ion of the War might appear the more ju&s;tifiable, it was re&s;olved, That no Acts of Ho&s;tility, or other Breaches of Peace &s;hould be pretended, than the Fort built by the Count <HI>Se|rini,</HI> being a matter really again&s;t the Articles of the la&s;t Peace; the Demoli&s;hment whereof, the <HI>Ottomon</HI> Force intended to make the princi|pal end of their fir&s;t Enterprize, in which if they encountred any oppo&s;ition from the Emperor, the Cau&s;e of their War would be then the more plau&s;ible; for as yet the Emperour had not fully declared his approbation of that Work, rai&s;ed by <HI>Serini,</HI> as agreeable to his A&s;&s;ent, or Plea|&s;ure. On the other &s;ide with no le&s;s caution and labour did the Chri&s;tians endeavour to &s;e|cure their Frontiers, by rai&s;ing their Militia, and reinforcing their Gari&s;ons, and e&s;pecially to per|fect the new Fort near <HI>Cani&s;ia,</HI> which, as it was thought &s;o con&s;iderable, as to countervail the inconveniencies and mi&s;eries of a War, &s;o the Turk thought it neither honourable, nor &s;ecure, until he had &s;een it razed, and levelled with the ground.</P>
<P>All things thus growing black and &s;tormy round about,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Acci|dent di|&s;po&s;ing the Chri|&s;tian Af|fairs to a peace with the <HI>Turk.</HI></NOTE> that nothing &s;eemed le&s;s probable, and it may be &s;aid, le&s;s po&s;&s;ible, than an accommo|dation; behold, on a &s;udden, an Accident fell out at <HI>Rome,</HI> from whence this War with the Turks received its life and heat, which becalmed much of the fury and &s;torm on the Chri&s;tian Con|fines, and inclined matters in <HI>Germany</HI> towards propo&s;itions of Peace, fearing that <HI>Italy,</HI> who had begotten this War, was not able (as things &s;tood) to contribute towards its maintenance and &s;upport. The occa&s;ion was this. It happen|ed that in the &s;treets of <HI>Rome</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;|&s;adours Coach was a&s;&s;aulted by the <HI>Cor&s;i</HI> Natves of the I&s;lle of <HI>Cor&s;ica,</HI> which are of the Popes Guard, the Page killed at the Boot of the Coach, and the Amba&s;&s;adors Lady wounded; whether this barbarous act was de&s;igned again&s;t the Per|&s;on of the Amba&s;&s;ador by any Per&s;ons of Emi|nency, or malice of the People, is little to the purpo&s;e I have now in hand; only the King took this Affront &s;o heinou&s;ly, that for the pre|&s;ent no acknowledgments or &s;atisfaction the Pope could make, could allay his ju&s;t re&s;ent|ment, or any thing be imagined po&s;&s;ible to ex|piate this indignity, be&s;ides a VVar. This News of this Divi&s;ion between the Son, and the &s;piritu|al Father, filled all the Mini&s;ters of <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople</HI> with much Joy, and with &s;ubject of Laugh|ter, and expectation of the Event, judging now that their daily Prayers for the Di&s;cord of the Chri&s;tian Princes among&s;t them&s;elves, were heard and granted, &s;ince they had &s;o far a|vailed, as to di&s;unite the very Oeconomy of Chri&s;tendom. And now they imagined that this difference would have a forcible influence on their Affairs in <HI>Hungary,</HI> and either incline the Emperor &s;peedily to a Peace, or otherwi&s;e to undertake a War on di&s;advantageous terms. Things had an i&s;&s;ue accordingly, for in a few Weeks after, advice came by Po&s;t from <HI>Ali</HI> Pa|&s;ha, then at <HI>Temi&s;war,</HI> that is <HI>Salam-Chaous,</HI> cal|led <HI>Chu&s;aein,</HI> who had long &s;ince been &s;ent to <HI>Vienna,</HI> with more di&s;tinct Demands of what the Turks propo&s;ed, and being &s;uppo&s;ed, through his long &s;tay, to be detained a Pri&s;oner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ba|ron of <HI>Gowez</HI> &s;ent to <HI>Ali</HI> Pa&s;ha.</NOTE> was again returned, and with him had brought the Baron of <HI>Goez,</HI> as Internuncio, &s;ent to <HI>Ali</HI> Pa&s;ha, to receive a more particular Imformation of the Turks propo&s;itions, for that the Emperor pretended, he was not as yet throughly &s;atisfied therein. And thus matters, beyond all expecta|tion, began to incline to an agreement, in re|gard that <HI>Rome</HI> being now in danger her &s;elf, not by the Turks, but by the Chri&s;tians, held her &s;elf uncapable to admini&s;ter that Fuel to the Fire of War which &s;he had promi&s;ed; &s;o that the League treated there beginning to fail, the Em|peror grew faint, and the Princes cold, in their Preparations, wi&s;hing &s;ome Cour&s;e could be ef|fected, which might bring matters to an accom|modation. Such were the Di&s;cour&s;es and imagi|nations of the Turks; in which condition we leave the &s;tate of Affairs until the beginning of the next year; and in the mean time it may not be from our purpo&s;e, nor tedious to the Reader, to record what befel this year mo&s;t remarkable to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, and their Trade in <HI>Turky,</HI> which al&s;o may be beneficial, by in&s;truction of pa&s;t examples, to &s;uch who &s;hall for the future be concerned in the Traffick and Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Levant.</P>

<P>THE Me&s;&s;engers from <HI>Algier,</HI> as before related, having promi&s;ed better Obedience for the future to the Commands of the Grand Signior, obtained a new Pa&s;ha for their City, and Country thereunto belonging; who before his departure, was enjoyned by the Grand Signior to di&s;po&s;e Affairs with the Earl of <HI>Win|chel&s;ea,</HI> his Maje&s;ties Amba&s;&s;ador at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> as might demon&s;trate his di&s;po&s;itions towards a Peace, and his de&s;ire that the <HI>Algerines</HI> &s;hould do the like, and accept of that Clau&s;e in the Articles,

<P>In <HI>May,</HI> Advice was brought to the Lord Am|ba&s;&s;ador, how that the <HI>Ann,</HI> a Frigat of his Ma|je&s;ties Royal Navy, commanded by Captain <HI>Jonas Pool,</HI> which had convoyed the general Ships to <HI>Symrna,</HI> in her pa&s;&s;age homewards &s;topped at the <HI>Morea,</HI> and came to an Anchor near a place in that Country, called the Black Mountain, com|modious to Wood and Water in; to which end were landed three&s;core men, armed with Swords and Firelocks; the&s;e made havock of the Woods on all &s;ides, loading their Boats away as fa&s;t as they could, and not only &s;o, but &s;et great Frees on Fire which in that dry Sea&s;on of the Year di&s;per&s;ed it &s;elf far and wide; which being &s;een at a di&s;tance in the Night, alarmed the People of the Country, &s;o that the Begh; or Governor came down with &s;ome Force to di&s;cover the matter, &s;uppo&s;ing that &s;ome <HI>Malte&s;es,</HI> or <HI>Vene|tians</HI> might be landed. At the approach of this Body of <HI>Turks,</HI> our Men quitted the Woods, and &s;hifted away as fa&s;t as they could to their Boats, of which Thirty eight e&s;caped, the re&s;t falling &s;hort were intercepted by the <HI>Turks,</HI> and Eleven of them were killed, and Eleven taken Captives; and of the <HI>Turks,</HI> two Aga's, and Two or Three others had the fortune to fall by &s;ome Musket|&s;hot from our men, whil&s;t in this confu&s;ion they endeavoured to defend them&s;elves. On the news hereof, our Lord Amba&s;&s;ador repre&s;ented the whole matter to the Vizier, declaring, That it was lawful according to our Capitulations, to take refre&s;hments, and &s;upply our wants in any part of the Grand Signiors Dominions; and that therefore he demanded Ju&s;tice on the Begh of the <HI>Morea,</HI> and re&s;titution of the Captives. But the Vizier under&s;tanding that &s;ome <HI>Turks</HI> were killed in the skirmi&s;h, lent not &s;o ready an ear to the&s;e Complaints; how&s;oever, to be acquitted of the Amba&s;&s;adors &s;olicitations, referred the bu&s;ine&s;s to the Examination and Ju&s;tice of the Captain Pa|&s;ha: But it falling out that at that time the Con&s;ul and Merchants at <HI>Smyrna</HI> had an un|happy difference with the Captain Pa&s;ha, (which &s;hall in the next place be related) was the Cau&s;e that all Applications to his Fa|vour and Ju&s;tice were &s;u&s;pended, and a &s;low progre&s;s made towards obtaining the liberty of tho&s;e poor unfortunate men. How&s;oever, &s;ome months after it happened that the Begh of the <HI>Morea</HI> being removed from that Government, and coming to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> with his whole E&s;tate, brought with him the Eleven <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> which he had taken, and offered them to &s;ale unto the Amba&s;&s;ador, who con&s;idering that they were <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> and &s;uch as had been en&s;laved in actual Service of their King, he e&s;teemed him|&s;elf obliged both in Charity and Honour to re|deem them. But the Ca&s;e appeared too foul to demand their Liberty by &s;trength of the Capitu|lations; for be&s;ides that, the cutting Wood in places inhabited without permi&s;&s;ion, is a Rob|bery and a Crime in its &s;elf, not to be maintained by the Law of Nations, the killing of a principal Aga, and wounding others, might &s;ufficiently warrant the <HI>Turks,</HI> without any Breach of Peace, to detain the&s;e men as lawful Captives: Where|fore the Lord Amba&s;&s;ador deeming it un&s;eemly, that tho&s;e who had &s;erved in his Maje&s;ties Navy &s;hould be condemned to the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Gallies, di&s;|bur&s;ed Fourteen hundred Lion Dollars, which was demanded for them, which was afterwards repay'd him by his Maje&s;ty; and having cloathed, and provided them with nece&s;&s;aries for their Voyage, conveyed them with the fir&s;t occa&s;ions into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The difference between the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, and the Captain Pa&s;ha which impeded the Liberty, for &s;ome time, of the&s;e Captives, had its Origi|nal at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> where &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants making Collation one Evening in a Garden were a&s;&s;aulted and beaten by certain drunken<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Soldiers belonging to the Sea.

The Con&s;ul knowing it &s;ome advantage in <HI>Turky</HI> to complain fir&s;t, &s;ent to the <HI>Kadi,</HI> giving him to under&s;tand the ill u&s;age of Four of his Merchants (who&s;e names he gave in writing) by the unruly Levents, whil&s;t they innocently, and without injury to any, diverti&s;ed them&s;elves in a Garden; to which, for the pre&s;ent, little more was given in an&s;wer, than that on a farther examination of the Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, the Conful &s;hould receive Ju&s;tice In the mean time the Turk, who had been beaten in the Con&s;uls Hou&s;e, re&s;olved not to leave the Gate till he had received &s;atisfaction for his blows; and the others that were his Comrades demand|ed their Slave from the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> which was lo&s;t, by who&s;e means and a&s;&s;i&s;tance (as they pretend) he had made his E&s;cape. The matter came now to high Demands on both &s;ides, which the <HI>Kadi,</HI> either not being de&s;irous, or not of &s;ufficient Au|thority to compound, the Gally departed with|out any agreement, and the complaint was car|ried by the Turks to the Captain Pa&s;ha, who then being with his Fleet at <HI>Mytiline,</HI> with little other thoughts or bu&s;ine&s;s, was glad of this oc|ca&s;ion to get Money, and therefore &s;uddenly re|turned the Gally again, with Orders to bring before him the Four Merchants, who&s;e names he particularized, to make an&s;wer to their ac|cu&s;ation of having beaten his Levents, and con|trived the e&s;cape of the &s;lave. The Con&s;ul and Merchants being affrighted by this Me&s;&s;age, and Command of &s;o great a Per&s;onage, endeavoured with Money to accommodate the Bu&s;ine&s;s, by force of which it was at length taken up, co&s;ting in all the &s;umm of Two thou&s;and &s;even hundred Dollars, or thereabouts. The which pa&s;&s;age
<PB N="130" REF="69">may &s;erve for an example to &s;uch as live in <HI>Turky,</HI> that all troubles of this nature are be&s;t compound|ed for at fir&s;t; for at the beginning nothing more was demanded than the price of the Slave, &amp; of the broken pate of the Levent: But being &s;uffered to come under the Cognizance of powerful and co|verous Tyrants; as there is no fahtoming their un&s;atiable de&s;ires, &s;o there is no pro&s;pect into what inconvenient dangers &s;uch Affairs will involve, and entagle them&s;elves.</P>
<P>As <HI>Turky</HI> hath been &s;eldom or never without having fal&s;e Money currant, &s;o the be&s;t &s;ort of Silver hath been &s;o clipped by the Jews, <HI>Arme|nians,</HI> Merchants, and others; that the Dollar was brought at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> to &s;ix Drams, and at <HI>Smyrna</HI> to &s;even, which made great confu&s;ion in the Trade of the&s;e Countries. Wherefore the Vizier as he had already given proof and te&s;ti|mony to the World of his &s;trict ob&s;ervance, and adherence to the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Law, &s;o he was de|&s;irous to appear highly careful and &s;en&s;ible of the Publick Intere&s;t: And therefore as the mo&s;t nece&s;|&s;ary work, he began with the Dollars of &s;ix Drams, proclaiming that they &s;hould no longer pa&s;s in payments,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Vi|zier's Edict, again&s;t Dollars of &s;ix Drams.</NOTE> and that tho&s;e in who&s;e hands they were found, delivering them into the Mint, &s;hould receive a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> 80 in return of every &s;uch Dol|lar, by which means the Mint would ad|vance a Fourth on every Dollar, e&s;teem|ing every Dram worth Fourteen A&s;pers, and that for the pre&s;ent no Dollar being currant under &s;even Drams, it might afterwards be brought to Lyons, and Dollars of nine Drams; which regu|lation, though at fir&s;t grievous to &s;ome particular per&s;ons, would afterwards redound to the com|mon advanrage and benefit of Trade. To for|ward which De&s;ign the Grand Signior, and Queen Mother &s;ent all their Dollars of &s;ix Drams to be new coined into A&s;pers at the Mint, &s;o likewi&s;e did the Vizier, intending to be very &s;trict in pro|hibition of that Money. But a while after it hap|pened that the Trea&s;urer of the Viziers Steward having occa&s;ion to pay Monies, either for his own or his Ma&s;ters account, forced &s;ome Bags of Six Drams on tho&s;e to whom payment was to be made; the Receivers denied to accept them; but he being a powerful man, and very urgent, forced the Mony upon them, with which laden, as they had received them, they went directly to the Vizier, acquainting him that they were de&s;irous to obey his Commands, as to the &s;ix Dram Dol|lars, but his Stewards Trea&s;urer had forced on them that &s;ort of Money, which if it was his plea|&s;ure that they &s;hould &s;till pa&s;s, they were con|tented to receive; if not, they de&s;ired him to give Command for their payment in other Mo|ney. The Vizier being highly enraged, that the fir&s;t Violation of his Commands &s;hould begin in his own Family, immediately ordered, without farther proof or proce&s;s, that the Offenders Head &s;hould be &s;truck off, and his body thrown into the Sea; which Sentence was executed in the &s;ame hour for example and terror of others, and to expiate the crime, and take away the &s;candal from the Fountain of Ju&s;tice, who&s;e &s;treams can never be e&s;teemed to run clear when the &s;ource is corrupted. In like manner the Over&s;eer of the Mint was &s;trangled, and <HI>Emir</HI> Pa&s;ha, formerly Pa&s;ha of Grand <HI>Cairo,</HI> was bani&s;hed to the I&s;le of <HI>Lemnos,</HI> for making the Coin of A&s;pers 5 <HI>per Cent.</HI> wor&s;e than their true value.</P>
<P>The Merchants at <HI>Aleppo,</HI> being far from the Court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mer|chants <HI>Aleppo.</HI></NOTE> are more &s;ubject to trouble&s;om Avanias than others, who are nearer to the Head or Fountain, from whence Ju&s;tice &s;hould pro|&s;eed as may appear by many examples, and particularly by an accident which fell out there this year. For it happened, that a Jani|&s;ary which &s;erved the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, riding abroad with &s;ome of the Merchants, for want of heed, or the unruline&s;s of his Hor&s;e, chanced to hurt a Youth playing in the &s;treets. Whereup|on the Merchants, and the Jani&s;ary, not to &s;uf|fer this bu&s;ine&s;s to come within the knowledge of the Cities Officers, immediately for &s;ome Money quieted the complaints, and &s;topped the farther demands of the Father; and to make the bu&s;i|ne&s;s more &s;ecure, cau&s;ed the Father to make Ho|get before the <HI>Kadi,</HI> that he was well &s;atisfied, and remained without farther pretence, either on the Merchant, or the Jani&s;ary, for the hurt which his Child had received. But the Pa&s;ha, who had for a long time attentively watched an opportunity to extort Money from the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> was re&s;olved not to let pa&s;s this fair occa&s;ion; and therefore &s;ent to demand from the Con&s;ul tho&s;e Merchants, which he called Acce&s;&s;ories to this mi&s;chief, and the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inates of a <HI>Mu&s;&s;ulman.</HI> The Con&s;ul appearing in Per&s;on before the Pa&s;ha, denied to deliver up the Merchants, being guilt|le&s;s of any crime; and that for hurt to the Child, the Father had received full &s;atisfaction from the Jani&s;ary, and given a di&s;charge before the <HI>Kadi.</HI> How&s;oever this rea&s;on would not pacifie the Pa|&s;ha, who could acknowledge no other argu|ment available than a Sum of Money; and therefore in pro&s;ecution of his de&s;ign produced Ten fal&s;e Witne&s;&s;es, that the Child was dead of its hurt, and that <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> men had done the mi&s;|chief. The Con&s;ul had now no other an&s;wer than a flat denial; for the Pa&s;ha had forced by threats the Hoget from the Jani&s;ary, and per&s;i&s;t|ing with con&s;tancy in defence of his Merchants, the Pa&s;ha confined him for an hours time in a Chamber of his Hou&s;e, and beat, and impri&s;oned his Druggerman. The Con&s;ul afterwards re|turned home; and perceiving a difference be|tween the Pa&s;ha and the Mufti, purcha&s;ed the favour of the Mufti on his &s;ide, and procured from him an Hoget of the &s;everal proceedings in this bu&s;ine&s;s, which was di&s;patched away with all expedition to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> that a redre&s;s of this injury might be obtained from the Superiour Power. Whil&s;t the Lord Amba&s;&s;ador in due manner re&s;ented this breach of Capitulations, and prepared to make his complaints to the Vizier, it happened that certain Chri&s;tians of <HI>Aleppo,</HI> from whom the Pa&s;ha had forced 18000 Dollars by unju&s;t extortion, were then at Court &s;olliciting the re&s;tauration of their right. The Amba&s;&s;ador judging this a convenient and opportune prepa|ration to prepo&s;&s;e&s;s the mind of the Vizier with a true apprehen&s;ion of the inju&s;tice of this Pa&s;ha, encouraged and pricked forward the&s;e abu&s;ed and oppre&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians in their complaints; and the next day pre&s;ented his Memorial to the Vi|zier, containing all the particulars of the late pa&s;|&s;ages at <HI>Aleppo;</HI> Which with the other Crimes alledged the Day before, &s;o moved the mind of the Vizier, that he promi&s;ed the Amba&s;&s;ador to &s;end a Kapugiba&s;hee of the Grand Signior to en|quire into the Truth of the&s;e Allegations; and that he might be &s;atisfied of his real intentions to do him ju&s;tice, he advi&s;ed him to &s;end a Me&s;|&s;enger in company with this Officer, who might witne&s;s the reality of his proceedings. The Ka|pugiba&s;hee being in this manner di&s;patched, and arriving at <HI>Aleppo,</HI> made the Pa&s;ha refund the Money he had unju&s;tly taken from the poor op|pre&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians of that Country; in which good action my Lord Amba&s;ador had been an u&s;eful in&s;trument, having encouraged the Agents
<PB N="131" REF="69">of tho&s;e Chri&s;tians at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI>coun&s;elled them what Cour&s;e to take, and introduced them by his Chief Interpreter to the Pre&s;ence of the Vizier, for which he received the thanks of the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Armenian</HI> Patriarchs, who gratefully acknowledged to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;ul at <HI>Aleppo,</HI> how much they were engaged to the charity and favour of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> amba&s;&s;ador: But whil&s;t all mens eyes were in expectation what farther pro|ceedings were de&s;igned again&s;t the Pa&s;ha in fa|vour of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> the Officer denied to have received any in&s;tructions therein, and &s;o return|ed to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> without taking notice of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Concernment. The Amba&s;&s;ador judging him&s;elf herein &s;lighted, &s;ent to the Viziers Kahya to know the my&s;tery of this neglect; for the Vi|zier and him&s;elf having pawned his word and promi&s;es to do him ju&s;tice again&s;t the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Aleppo,</HI> it &s;eemed &s;trange that his a&s;&s;urances &s;hould vani&s;h into nothing; and that he &s;o mean|ly e&s;teemed his Quality and Office, as to di&s;pa|rage it with &s;o much di&s;repute and contempt as mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily befal him, &s;hould this Pa&s;ha e&s;cape without exemplary puni&s;hment; for then the World might with rea&s;on believe his Appli|cations of no prevalency, and his Merchants fear the in&s;ufficiency of his protection. To which the Kahya an&s;wered, That it was true, that the Ka|pugiba&s;hee was not in&s;tructed in the Concern|ments of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> in regard a more &s;olemn and eminent piece of Ju&s;tice was de&s;igned for the Amba&s;&s;ador, than any that could be performed by the Kapugiba&s;hee, and that in twenty or thirty days at farthe&s;t, the Pa&s;ha &s;hould be de|prived of his Office. The next day following the Kahya advi&s;ed that the Hatte&s;heriff, or Im|perial Command for depo&s;ing of the Pa&s;ha, was &s;igned, and that old <HI>Mahomet</HI> Pa&s;ha of <HI>Darbiquier</HI> was con&s;tituted in his place; which News was highly plea&s;ing to the Lord Amba&s;&s;ador, in re|gard he had been an ancient Friend to the <HI>Eng|li&s;h,</HI> under whom he pre&s;aged to our Nation at <HI>Aleppo</HI> all &s;ecurity and contentment.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflecti|ons on the Premi&s;es.</NOTE> By which Story it is ob&s;ervable, That though the Supream Officers among&s;t the <HI>Turks</HI> are willing to &s;atisfie Chri&s;tian Amba&s;&s;adors re&s;ident with them, in the Care they have of their Welfare, and main|tenance of their Capitulations; yet are not de&s;i|rous to publi&s;h to their own People the puni&s;h|ment of their Grand Officers, at the in&s;tigation or for the concernment of a Chri&s;tian: And that tho the <HI>Turks</HI> are apprehended among&s;t us for a People of great Morality, and &s;inglene&s;s in their Dealings; yet it is ob&s;ervable in this, as well as in o|ther their actions, that they have double Tongues and Faces, and know how to act with as fine a Thread, and plau&s;ible pretences, as are accu&s;toma|ry in the mo&s;t politick and refined Courts of <HI>Italy.</HI></P>

<P>THE Baron of <HI>Goez,</HI> which at the end of the la&s;t Year arrived at <HI>Buda</HI> with &s;everal o|vertures of Peace, had &s;o far proceeded in his Treaty with <HI>Ali</HI> Pa&s;ha of <HI>Buda,</HI> that all Articles &s;eemed almo&s;t concluded, and &s;carce any diffi|culty to remain, unle&s;s the Surrender of <HI>Zekel|hyd</HI> on the Confines of <HI>Hungary;</HI> which al&s;o was afterwards accommodated by Agreement, That the City &s;hould be re&s;igned into the hands of the Prince of <HI>Tran&s;ilvania,</HI> as the mo&s;t equal Con|dition between the Emperor and the Turk. So that, matters thus &s;eeming to be compo&s;ed, all People talked of Peace with <HI>Germany,</HI> and that the force and mi&s;eries of Wars were to be turned upon <HI>Dalmatia:</HI> And though the <HI>Turks</HI> had no de&s;ign le&s;s in their thoughts than this, or any in|tentions towards a Peace, as will be proved by the Sequel; how&s;oever, the <HI>German</HI> Mini&s;ters, as men credulous of what they de&s;ire, gave the Peace for certainly concluded, in which conceit the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;o humoured and indulged their fancy, that they per&s;waded Prince <HI>Portia,</HI> the Chief Mi|ni&s;ter of State to the Emperor, in that manner of the reality of their intentions, that he neg|lected the nece&s;&s;ary Provi&s;ions and Preparations of War, And though he was often advi&s;ed by the Re&s;ident at the <HI>Ottomon</HI> Port, that all the&s;e Demon&s;trations of Peace were only Artifices of the <HI>Turk,</HI> to delude the Emperors Council;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> with words de|ceive the <HI>German</HI> Mini&s;ters.</NOTE> yet &s;o tenacious was he of this Opinion, that though it be but common rea&s;on, and the vulgar Rule of Policy for a Prince to arm, and &s;u&s;pect his Neigh|bour, who puts him&s;elf into a Warklike po&s;ture; yet this Great Per&s;onage, though in other things profoundly wi&s;e, and circum&s;pect, was &s;o de|luded, that he replyed to the Re&s;idents Advices to this effect, That it was the Office of a prudent and experienced Mini&s;ter to di&s;cover with dili|gence the re&s;olution of the Cabinet Councils of Princes, and not to give ear or credit to what is the common Voice or vogue of the Vulgar.</P>
<P>The Spring drawing near, the Vizier prepared all things for action, nominating and appointing &s;uch, who in his ab&s;ence were to &s;upply the Of|fices of State: <HI>I&s;hmael</HI> Pa&s;ha, then Pa&s;ha of <HI>Bu|da,</HI> was de&s;igned for <HI>Chimacam,</HI> or Governour of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> Pa&s;ha, Captain Pa&s;ha, Brother in Law to the Grand Vizier by Marriage of his Si&s;ter (and now the pre&s;ent Vi|zier) was made <HI>Chimacam</HI> at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> near the Per&s;on of the Grand Signior. All other pre|parations for War went forwards, Thirty pieces of Cannon from <HI>Scutari,</HI> and fifty from the Sera|glio, mo&s;t of a va&s;t bigne&s;s and weight, which had &s;erved in the taking of <HI>Babylon,</HI> with great &s;tore of Ammunition and Provi&s;ions of War, were tran&s;ported up the <HI>Danube</HI> to <HI>Belgrade,</HI> and the Princes of <HI>Moldavia,</HI> and <HI>Valachia,</HI> had now Commands &s;ent them to quicken their diligence in making their preparations of War, and in providing Sheep, Beef, Rice, and all &s;orts of Victuals for &s;upply of the Camp; and general Proclamation was made in all places, That all Soldiers, who received on A&s;per of pay from the Gr.

<P>About the middle of <HI>February</HI> the Hor&s;e Tail was &s;et forth at the Viziers Gate; (which is the u&s;ual &s;ignal of the Camps motion within the &s;pace of a Month) &s;o that none may excu&s;e him|&s;elf from the War for want of due and timely intimation. And though the time for departure nearly approached, yet the Grand Signior was &s;o impatient, that he would &s;carce expect until the Equinoctial,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gr.

But this ha&s;ty re&s;olution, and eager de&s;ire of his Journey, the Vizier, Multi, and others of his Coun&s;ellours, did mode|rate, per&s;wading him to a little longer patience: to which, though with &s;ome difficulty, he a&s;&s;en|ted; yet he could not forbear from his Hor&s;es back, and con&s;tant exerci&s;es abroad, nor could he be induced to take one Nights repo&s;e longer in his great Seraglio at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> but lodged at <HI>Daout</HI> Pa&s;ha, a &s;mall Palace about four miles di&s;tant from <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> Which ex|travagant manner of living mo&s;t People at|tributed
<PB N="132" REF="70">to his wandring humour, and delights in hunting, riding, and &s;uch like exerci&s;es, ha|ving his &s;ole plea&s;ure in the Woods and Fields: But others, who judged with better Foundation, did conceive, That the Grand Signiors choice of other places of Re&s;idence rather than his Im|perial Seraglio, proceeded not &s;o much from his own un&s;etled humour, and cour&s;e of living, as from an apprehen&s;ion of &s;ome De&s;igns, and mu|tinous Trea&s;ons of the Jani&s;aries again&s;t him: For to &s;peak the truth, &s;ince the death of <HI>Ku|perlee,</HI> the Militia began again to be corrupted; and if we may believe the opinion of the mo&s;t principal <HI>Turks,</HI> the Vizier undertook this War to employ the bu&s;ie &s;pirits of the Soldiery, which began to grow re&s;ty and in&s;olent through idlene&s;s, and by that means &s;ecure his own life, and e&s;tabli&s;h his Condition and Fortune.</P>
<P>The Equinoctial being come, the Grand Sig|nior would not have one days longer patience; for though the Sea&s;on was wet and rainny, yet the Tents were pitched; and though the Wind was &s;o violent and forcible as overturned almo&s;t the whole Camp, yet no difficulties and incon|veniencies of Weather could give one hour of intermi&s;&s;ion to the Sultans de&s;ires: Wherefore on the Ninth of this Month,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March.</NOTE> the Grand Signior departed from <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> attended with his Court, his principal Officers of State, and with what part of his Army was then a in readine&s;s to march.

Immediately before the Per&s;on of the Grand Sig|nior was led a Camel carrying the Alcoran in a Che&s;t covered with cloth of gold: The Gr.

And for greater expedition in the march of the Army, Proclamation was made of a general Rendezvous at <HI>Sophia</HI> at the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> Fea&s;t.</NOTE> <HI>Biram,</HI> then within Three weeks time, where they de&s;igned to &s;oil their Hor&s;e, and refre&s;h them&s;elves before they fell in earne&s;t to their bu&s;ine&s;s. But before the Grand Vizier departed from <HI>Adrianople</HI> to pro|&s;ecute a War in <HI>Hungary</HI> again&s;t the Emperor, he called Signior <HI>Ballarino</HI> to his pre&s;ence, as if he would treat with him of matters tending to an adju&s;tment with <HI>Venice;</HI> when at the &s;ame time he had 20000 men in a readine&s;s at <HI>Scutari</HI> to march into <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> and to joyn with other Forces in <HI>Bo&s;na</HI> and <HI>Croatia;</HI> but this di&s;&s;imula|tion and appearance of Treaty &s;erved only to di&s;cover on what Terms a Peace might be ob|tained, in ca&s;e Affairs in <HI>Hungary</HI> &s;hould be &s;o pre&s;&s;ing as to require an application &s;olely of Arms to that Country.</P>
<P>Not only had Signior <HI>Ballarino</HI> Affairs of pub|lick trouble, but likewi&s;e &s;omething touched him of private concernment in his own Family; where the <HI>Turks,</HI> I know not upon what infor|mation coming to fearch, found in his Hou&s;e two figures, one of a man, and the other of a woman made of Linen cloth, &s;tuffed with Wool and Cot|ton; the which were interpreted by the <HI>Turks</HI> to be Images of Sorcery and Inchantment; one re|pre&s;enting the Grand Signior, and the other his Mother, were de&s;igned in a &s;ecret manner, by thru&s;ting Needles and Pins into tho&s;e parts, where the Heart and Liver is, to cau&s;e tho&s;e whom they repre&s;ent to dye with macerations and con&s;um|ptions, according to the Inchantment of <HI>Me|dea.

<PB N="133" REF="70">was augmented by the reports of the Neighbour|hood, who hearing the Prie&s;t often recite his Litany, and &s;ing Evening-&s;ong, avouched that they con&s;tantly over-heard the Charms muttered in &s;uch forms as are u&s;ed by Magicians and Sor|cerers: Wherefore de&s;igning to take the Prie&s;t, who was the Father Provincial of St. <HI>Francis,</HI> and puni&s;h him for his Witchcraft, the good man fair|ly fled, and kept him&s;elf out of harms way, un|til Signior <HI>Ballarino</HI> could quiet the minds of the <HI>Turks</HI> by &s;ome Art, which he more forcibly pra|cti&s;ed upon them by a &s;tronger charm of Money and Pre&s;ents than that which was the &s;ubject of their complaint.</P>
<P>In the mean time all fears and dangers of <HI>Can|dia</HI> vani&s;hed, becau&s;e the <HI>Turks</HI> bent their For|ces and chief of their &s;trength again&s;t their Ene|mies at Land: To provide again&s;t which, the Senate of <HI>Venice</HI> &s;ent into <HI>Dalmatia</HI> the Baron <HI>Spaar</HI> for General, with many other Officers un|der him, namely the Marque&s;s <HI>Maculani,</HI> Count <HI>Ettore Albano, Carlo Martinengo,</HI> and <HI>Roverelli,</HI> Count of <HI>Caudes,</HI> the Cavallier <HI>Grimaldi, Echen|felt,</HI> and others. Into <HI>Friuli, Franci&s;co Moro&s;ini</HI> was di&s;patched in quality of Proveditor General with &s;upream Power and Authority, and in this manner all matters were as well pro|vided and &s;ecured by Land, as they were by Sea.</P>
<P>The <HI>Biram</HI> chanced to happen out this Year towards the end of <HI>April,</HI> by which time the Vi|zier, and mo&s;t of his Army, a&s;&s;embled according to Proclamation at <HI>Sophia;</HI> where having conti|nued &s;ome time, and con&s;ulted well in what manner to put their de&s;igns in execution, they proceeded in their March towards <HI>Buda,</HI> and the Confines of <HI>Hungary;</HI> but in the way the Vizier was encountred by a Me&s;&s;enger from the Em|peror, offering all rea&s;onable Propo&s;itions of Peace, if po&s;&s;ibly a &s;top might be given to the farther progre&s;s of that va&s;t and formidable Ar|my. All matter, were propo&s;ed which probably might give &s;atisfaction; the Fort of Count <HI>Serini</HI> (the grand Eye-&s;ore of the <HI>Turks</HI>) was proffered to be demoli&s;hed, with other Conditions which before the March of the Army were never pro|po&s;ed or demanded. But the Vizier gave little ear to the&s;e fair Overtures, but proceeded for|wards in his Demands, as he did in his March: Requiring now, not the demoli&s;hment of the Fort, but the Surrender of it entirely with all the Strength, Artillery, and Ammunition into the hands of the Grand Signior. Had this condition been granted, it is probable the de&s;ires and pre|ten&s;ions of the <HI>Turks</HI> would not have &s;topped here, but have ri&s;en, as the &s;pirits of their Ene|mies had conde&s;cended, and exceeded all the hopes and advantage which they imagined pro|bable and fea&s;ible to be obtained by the War. Wherefore this Me&s;&s;age proving fruitle&s;s, the Bringer of it was permitted Licence to return in|to <HI>Germany:</HI> But the Re&s;ident was refu&s;ed di&s;|mi&s;&s;ion, being detained in the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Camp, as an In&s;trument to mediate a Peace, when both &s;ides &s;hould grow weary of the War.</P>
<P>About this time the <HI>Tartars</HI> were greatly in|fe&s;ted by the Co&s;&s;acks, who were then very for|midable and &s;trong,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Co&s;|&s;acks infe&s;t the <HI>Tartars.</HI></NOTE> approaching near the City of <HI>O&s;ac,</HI> the Key and chief Fortre&s;s of <HI>Tartary,</HI> under the Commann of a Fi&s;herman of the <HI>Bori&s;thenes,</HI> who having had great &s;ucce&s;&s;es, and collected a con&s;iderable &s;um of Money, became a dangerous Enemy: By Sea al&s;o they commanded ab&s;olutely, roving uncontrouled, having a Fleet of Saykes and Gallies near an hundred and fifty Sail, again&s;t whom the Tartar <HI>Han</HI> or King of <HI>Tartary</HI> craved of the Grand Signior forty &s;ail of Gallies that year to oppo&s;e them. But this Force of the Co&s;&s;acks was &s;oon abated; for it plea&s;ed God, that pa&s;&s;ing out of the <HI>Palus Moeotis</HI> through the narrow pa&s;|&s;age of <HI>Colchos</HI> into the Black Sea, the be&s;t part of this Fleet &s;uffered &s;hipwrack; with which they were &s;o di&s;mayed, that the twelve &s;ail of Gallies (which was the whole Force the <HI>Turks</HI> could &s;pare this year for that Sea) gave a check to the remainder, and forced them again to the Banks of the <HI>Bori&s;thenes.</HI> The re&s;t of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Fleet, con&s;i&s;ting, together with the Beys Gallies, in all but of thirty Sail, departed from <HI>Constantinople,</HI> with de&s;ign rather to make &s;ome appearance of a Fleet, and a noi&s;e among&s;t their own people, and collect the Contribu|tions of the I&s;les in the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> than out of hopes of effecting any thing again&s;t the <HI>Venetians;</HI> and &s;o it &s;ucceeded; for this Fleet remained the whole Summer at <HI>Mytilene,</HI> not daring to appear abroad for fear of the Enemy.</P>
<P>Though the <HI>Tartars</HI> were &s;o hardly be&s;et by the Co&s;&s;acks, yet their danger at home was not a &s;uf|ficient excu&s;e to di&s;ingage them from their a&s;&s;i|&s;tance in the War of <HI>Hungary.</HI> For the Vizier marching towards the Frontiers, &s;ent one Me&s;|&s;enger after the other to ha&s;ten the Tartar <HI>Han</HI> with all &s;peed po&s;&s;ible to the Wars. But the <HI>Tar|tars</HI> &s;eeming not &s;o willing, or &s;o ready as the <HI>Turks</HI> expected, more po&s;itive commands, and &s;e|vere threats, were di&s;patched than before, that laying a&s;ide all excu&s;es or delays, they &s;hould with all the Force of their Country attend in this pre&s;ent War again&s;t the Emperor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Tar|tar</HI> unwil|ling to go to the War.</NOTE> or otherwi&s;e the Tartar <HI>Han</HI> was to be deprived of his Govern|ment, and his Son con&s;tituted in his place. The&s;e &s;evere menaces reduced the <HI>Tartar</HI> to great &s;traits; fearful he was to di&s;plea&s;e the Sultan, not knowing what ill con&s;equences might proceed from thence; but more apprehen|&s;ive he was of the approaches of the Co&s;|&s;acks, and of the di&s;plea&s;ure of his own People, who were re&s;olved to &s;ee this fire of War extin|gui&s;hed in their own homes, before they would attend the de&s;igns, or &s;atisfie the Lu&s;ts of a &s;tranger Prince. In this Dilemma the Tartar <HI>Han</HI> finding him&s;elf, made u&s;e of fair words and pro|mi&s;es, ingaging his word. That after the harve&s;t was pa&s;t, no ob&s;tacle &s;hould prevent his com|pliance with the Sultans expectations; for at pre|&s;ent it was impo&s;&s;ible, in regard that &s;hould their People at this &s;ea&s;on be diverted from gathering the harve&s;t, the Corn and Fruit would remain on the ground, and &s;o occa&s;ion a Famine and de&s;truction of their Country. And herein the <HI>Tartar</HI> had &s;ome rea&s;on; for the&s;e People go not to the Wars, as other Nations, who leave a &s;uffi|cient number behind to cultivate their Country, and perform all other Offices and Imployments in a Common-wealth: But the&s;e making their chief livelihood and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence on the prey and robberies they make on their Neighbours;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cour&s;e of life a|mong&s;t the <HI>Tartars.</HI></NOTE> as many as re&s;olve to eat Bread and live, who are men not old or impotent, able to bear Arms, betake them|&s;elves to their Hor&s;e and Bow; &s;o that when their Army is abroad, their Towns and Villages are only inhabited, and defended by their Women.

<P>THE Great Vizier being by this time ar|rived on the Frontiers with a very con&s;i|derable Army; the G. Signior at <HI>Adriano|ple</HI> continued his u&s;ual plea&s;ures in Hunting, Ri|ding, throwing of the Gerit or Dart, and in other pa&s;times and &s;ports of this nature; at which time ca&s;ting his Eves upon one <HI>A&s;an</HI> Aga, a &s;prightly youth of his Seraglio, a <HI>Polonian</HI> by Nation, to be more forward and active than any of his Court, took an affection to him, &s;o &s;udden and violent, as might be judged neither well founded, nor long durable; for the Grand Signior having heard, that there were examples among&s;t the Emperors his Predece&s;&s;ors, not only in the ab|&s;ence, but in the pre&s;ence al&s;o of the Vizier, of maintaining and con&s;tituting a Favourite, in Turki&s;h called <HI>Mo&s;ayp,</HI> did own publickly the Election of this per&s;on for his Friend and Com|panion; &s;o that this Minion was on a &s;udden &s;o highly ingratiated in the favour of his Prince, that he always rode equal with him; Cloathed as rich, and mounted as well. as the Sultan him&s;elf, as if he had been his Coadjutor, or Companion in the Empire. The Queen Mother, the <HI>Kuzlier</HI> Aga, and other rich Eunuchs of the Seraglio, the Chi|macams of <HI>Adrianople,</HI> and <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> with all the Great Officers and principal Mini&s;ters, were commanded to make Pre&s;enr of Money, Jewels, and other Sacrifices, to this ri&s;ing Sun; whom now every one &s;o courted and adored, that he became the only talk and admiration of the whole Town; no other di&s;cour&s;e there was but of <HI>A&s;an Chelabei, A&s;an</HI> the fine accompli&s;ht Gentleman, <HI>A&s;an</HI> the only Creature of Fortune, and Idol of the whole World. This high and &s;udden promotion of this Youth, greatly di&s;plea&s;ed the Queen Mother, <HI>Kuzlier</HI> Aga, who had Creatures of their own to perfer, and by their means became the Envy and Emulation of the whole Court, &s;o that there wanted not &s;uch who po&s;ted the news to the Vi|zier, as him, on whom the growing greatne&s;s of <HI>A&s;an</HI> might have the mo&s;t dangerous reflection: But the Vizier duly con&s;idering, that the deep impre&s;&s;ions this Youth had made in the affections of his Ma&s;ter, were not to be removed by plain dealing, but by &s;ome more occult Artifice and di&s;&s;imulation, took occa&s;ion to write to the Grand Signior, in favour of <HI>A&s;an</HI> Aga, extolling the pru|dence of his choice of &s;o compleat and hopeful a Youth for his Favourite; but that it was pity, &s;o pregnant parts as tho&s;e with which <HI>A&s;an</HI> was en|dued, fit to promote his Ma&s;ters Service and In|tere&s;t, &s;hould be Encloi&s;tred, and Buried in the &s;oftne&s;s and delights of his Seraglio; and therefore his Coun&s;el was, to have him preferred to &s;ome government, and degree of a Pa&s;ha, to which his Abilities and Education, in the Nur&s;ery and Di&s;|cipline of the Court, had abundantly accompli&s;h|ed him. <HI>Pe&s;&s;imum genus inimicorum, laudantes.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tacitus.</NOTE> Nor were the Queen Mother, and <HI>Kuzlier</HI> Aga, all this time wanting in their contrivance to un|dermine him, but not with a de&s;ign &s;pun with &s;o fine a Thread, pro&s;e&s;&s;ing them&s;elves openly his Adver&s;aries: For which Courtly Policy, the Vi|zier only received a check, and &s;ome few verbal reproofs, for intermedling with what &s;o nearly concerned his Ma&s;ters Fancy and Affection: But the <HI>Kuzlier</HI> Aga, was by one word from <HI>A&s;an</HI> (whom he had di&s;covered to be his Enemy) deprived of his Office,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Kuz|lier</HI> Aga bani&s;hed to <HI>Cairo.</HI></NOTE> and had therewith lo&s;t his Life, had not the Queen Mother pow|erfully interceded for him, and gained an ex|change of his puni&s;hment from death to ba|ni&s;hment in Grand <HI>Cairo</HI> in <HI>Aegypt.</HI> The Baltagiba&s;hee al&s;o (who is the Captain of that part of the Grand Signiors Guard,<NOTE PLACE="marg">As al&s;o the Baltagiba|&s;hee.</NOTE> who car|ry Hatchers, and are empyloyed in cutting Wood for the u&s;e of the Seraglio) being di&s;covered to be a Confederate in the &s;ame Plot again&s;t the Favourite, was condemned to the &s;ame puni&s;hment, and immediately both of them di&s;peeded away to the place, where they were to &s;pend the remainder of their days. Grand <HI>Cairo</HI> hath always been the place of Bani&s;hment for unfortunate Courtiers, or rather of &s;uch who have with much greatne&s;s, plenty, and contentment &s;ometimes enjoyed the Fruit of their great Riche&s;s, gained in the Sun|&s;hine and &s;ummer of their Princes favour. To this City al&s;o was this <HI>Kuzlier</HI> Aga exiled, who in the enjoyment of his Office for &s;everal years, had ama&s;&s;ed a mo&s;t va&s;t Wealth, incredible to be &s;poken, and much to be wondred, that a Negro, who&s;e hue and per&s;on is contemptible among&s;t all, whom God hath created of a Colour diffe|rent from tho&s;e who partake more of Light, and are of nearer &s;imilitude with the Sun, and Nature of an Angel; one who&s;e Original was a Slave, and his price never above a Hundred Pieces of Eight, &s;hould be loaded with &s;uch Goods of Fortune, and enriched with the Trea&s;ury of a Prince: His Retinue con&s;i&s;ted of about 900 Hor&s;e, (be&s;ides Ca|mels, and Mules for his Baggage) among&s;t which a Hundred were led Hor&s;es, worth Seven or eight hundred Dollars a Hor&s;e, and that he might &s;till &s;eem to live by his Princes Bounty, a thou&s;and A&s;pers a day was to be his con&s;tant pay, to be i&s;&s;ued out of the G.

This poor Negro thus deve&s;ted of all, returned to his primary condition of a Slave, in which he was born, and for many years had lived, and was now bani&s;hed, for&s;aken, and di&s;con&s;olate in the upper <HI>Egypt;</HI> whither going &s;carce with &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve him from Famine and Beggery, the Beyes of <HI>Egypt,</HI> out of compa&s;&s;ion, be&s;towed on him an Alms of twelve Pur&s;es, being Eight Thou&s;and four hundred Dollars, according to the Account of <HI>Cairo,</HI> now the only &s;upport and &s;u&s;tenance of his Life.</P>
<P>This Victory gained over the&s;e great Per&s;o|nages, and foyl given to the Queen Mother her &s;elf, was not carried by this young Favourite with that prudent equality of mind as was de|cent; but being puffed up with pride and glory, adventured to a judgment and cen&s;ure of the deepe&s;t matters of State, which touched not a little the jealou&s;ie and &s;corn of the Great Vizier, who therefore wrote to all tho&s;e grave Sages, to who&s;e Coun&s;el he conceived the Sultan gave any ear or credit; repre&s;enting with extraordinary pa&s;&s;ion and fervency the dangers he apprehended might befal his Ma&s;ter, and his Empire, whil&s;t both were &s;ubject to the unexperienced Coun&s;els of <HI>A&s;an,</HI> a Youth both in years and knowledge.

<P>AND &s;ince we have related a Story which partly repre&s;ents the uncon&s;tancy and ty|ranny of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Greatne&s;s, it may yet plea&s;e the Reader, &s;hould we add another, tho' a little out of its due order, not le&s;s remarkable, and worthy of Record, than the former.</P>
<P>When <HI>Newhau&s;el</HI> was be&s;ieged, called by the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Hungarians, Oyar,</HI> and divers attempts made on it in vain; <HI>Samozade</HI> the Reis Effendi, with le&s;s caution and wi&s;dom than he did u&s;ually practi&s;e in other matters, wrote a Letter to the Chief Eunuch of the Women, then in the Serag|lio at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> to this effect. That if the Grand Signior de&s;ired to have that Fortre&s;s taken that was then be&s;ieged, he &s;hould chu&s;e a more able Captain for his Army than the pre&s;ent Vi|zier, a Per&s;on who had only been educated in a Tekeh, or Colledge, and &s;tudied in the &s;pecu|lations of Law, and not in the Oda's of the Ja|ni&s;aries, or Cu&s;tomes and Exerci&s;es of the Camp: And therefore if his Maje&s;ty thought fit to chu&s;e another General, he could not ca&s;t his eyes on any more able and de&s;erving than <HI>Ibrahim</HI> Pa&s;ha his Son in Law, a Per&s;on qualified for the Office of Vizier, being skilful in all points both of War and Peace. This Eunuch being the per&s;on that had &s;ucceeded to the former lately exiled, ha|ving received this Letter, immediately without farther Art or Prologue, read it to the Grand Signior, at which though at fir&s;t he was &s;tartled, yet not as yet weary of the Vizier, but ftill con|&s;erving a kindne&s;s and e&s;teem for him, took the Letter from the Eunuch, and &s;ent it to the Vizier, permitting him to inflict what puni&s;hment he judged mo&s;t agreeable to his own pre&s;ervation and vindication of honour. The Vizier, having received this Letter, &s;eemed not in the lea&s;t to be &s;urprized with the perfidiou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>Samozade,</HI> but in a cool temper recollecting all the Applica|tions and Addre&s;&s;es (which we have mentioned before) at his fir&s;t entrance into this Supream Office, and judging from thence, that he was not a Per&s;on capable of friend&s;hip, or a &s;teadine&s;s to his Intere&s;t, &s;ent for him, and for <HI>Ibrahim</HI> Pa|&s;ha his Son in Law to his pre&s;ence, and fir&s;t ha|ving upbraided his Treachery, and want of Inte|grity, in return to all the Care&s;&s;es and Endea|vours he had u&s;ed to win his Faith, cau&s;ed both their heads to be &s;truck off by the Executio|ner.</P>
<P>This <HI>Samozade</HI> was one of the mo&s;t wi&s;e and be&s;t practi&s;ed Secretaries of State that ever &s;erved the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, and one whom our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> much lamented, being perfectly acquainted with the particulars of our Capitulations, and Con&s;tituti|on of our Trade; and had not his extraordinary Covetou&s;ne&s;s blemi&s;hed his other moral Vertues, he might have been e&s;teemed a man rare, and a Mini&s;ter not unworthy the greate&s;t Monarch of the World. The Riche&s;s he had collected du|ring the time of his State-Negotiations were in|credible and immen&s;e, for he &s;pared and lo&s;t no opportunity of gains, which rendred him the more liable and obnoxious to the &s;troke of Ju&s;tice. His Goods were now &s;ei&s;ed on for &s;ervice of the Sultan, his Ma&s;ter, as ju&s;tly confi&s;cated for Trea|&s;on; his E&s;tate was found to amount unto three Millions of Pieces of Eight in ready Money; he had &s;ixteen hundred Camels, four Hundred

<HEAD>Of an Avania brought upon the <HI>Dutch</HI> Nation.</HEAD>
<P>BEfore we proceed on with the Relation of the War in <HI>Hungary,</HI> where we for a time &s;hall leave the Great Vizier, it will not be from our purpo&s;e to digre&s;s a little in recounting certain in|termediate Accidents, which had reference to our own and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Nations Intere&s;t at the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Court. And fir&s;t I &s;hall begin with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> to whom a con&s;iderable trouble and misfortune be|&s;el, by means of a Ship of their called the Em|peror <HI>Octaviano,</HI> which de&s;igning to lade <HI>Turks</HI> Goods at <HI>Alexandria</HI> for <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> had her Licence and Di&s;patches obtained by means of the <HI>Holland</HI> Re&s;ident, the Sieur <HI>Warnero.</HI> This Ship being accordingly laden at <HI>Alexandria,</HI> whereon al&s;o the Grand Signior him&s;elf had Thirty thou|&s;and Dollars Intere&s;t, and being ready to depart, was near the Port &s;urprized by the <HI>Venetian,</HI> and <HI>Malte&s;e</HI> Cor&s;airs, and &s;o taken. This News was po&s;ted over land from Grand <HI>Cairo,</HI> and the Car|go &s;ent of the Goods, importing Four&s;core and four thou&s;and Dollars, which in the Month of <HI>June</HI> arrived at <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> The per&s;ons in|tere&s;ted in this lo&s;s being many, in the nature of a Tumult applied them&s;elves to the Grand Sig|nior, and demanded &s;entence again&s;t the <HI>Dutch</HI> Re&s;ident for reparation, alledging that he had recommended the Ship, and Com|mander, who had combined with the Cor|&s;airs to &s;urprize him, and that the Re&s;ident had engaged for the faithfulne&s;s of the Captain, who had betrayed their Goods, not endeavouring to defend him&s;elf &s;o much as by the &s;hot of one Musket. The Grand Signior being likewi&s;e con|cerned herein him&s;elf, was ea&s;ily per&s;waded to grant his Order and Sentence, That the lo&s;s of all &s;hould concern the <HI>Dutch</HI> Re&s;ident, and his Nation, requiring the Chimacam of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> to &s;ummon the Re&s;ident, and intimate his plea|&s;ure therein, exacting a time limited for the pay|ment. The Re&s;ident being called to &s;everal Au|diences thereupon, denied to have had any hand in the employment of this Ship on the this Voy|age, and that their Capitulations, to which the Grand Signior had &s;worn, acquitted him from being re&s;pon&s;ible for the mi&s;demeanors of any of his Nation, for who&s;e fidelity and good behavi|vour he had never per&s;onally engaged, and thereupon po&s;itively refu&s;ed to make him|&s;elf liable for payment of this Money, to which he was neither obliged by the Law of Nations, nor his own private Act. Notwith|&s;tanding which, the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;entenced the Re&s;ident to be liable to make &s;atisfaction, in regard that when the Ship was fir&s;t freighted, he appeared before the Chimacam at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and being asked whether the Commander of this Ship was an hone&s;t man, and one who might be intru&s;ted with &s;uch a concernment of the <HI>Turks;</HI> his An&s;wer was, That he believed he might, and that he was always e&s;teemed faithful and hone&s;t to his Tru&s;t: which in the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Law amount|ing to as much as if he had &s;aid, he would be|come his &s;ecurity, the Grand Signior confirmed the former &s;entence again&s;t the Re&s;ident, and with ha&s;te and fury di&s;patched a Kapugiba&s;hee to bring his Per&s;on to <HI>Adrianople;</HI> where being arrived, and continuing as yet con&s;tant to his fir&s;t An&s;wer, was committed to cu&s;tody of the Chaousba&s;hee, or Chief of the Pur&s;uivants, where they gave him time until after the Fea&s;t of the little <HI>Biram,</HI> to con&s;ult his own good and &s;ecurity of his Nation within the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Dominions. The Fea&s;t was no &s;ooner ended, but the Grand Sig|nior &s;ent immediately to know his untimate re|&s;olution, declaring, That if he continued &s;till ob&s;tinate again&s;t his Power, he had commanded that he &s;hould be committed to that Dungeon which had &s;ome few years before been the Lodging of other Chri&s;tian Mini&s;ters. The Re|&s;ident terrified at the thoughts of &s;uch an Impri|&s;onment, declined from his former con&s;tancy, ingaging to pay the Money in an Hundred and five days time, for no longer would be granted; &s;o violent and unrea&s;onable the <HI>Turks</HI> were in their demands, again&s;t the Law of Nations, the particular Capitulations, and the common rea&s;on and ju&s;tice of the World. This Money was for the mo&s;t part taken up by the <HI>Dutch</HI> Na|tion in <HI>Turky</HI> at Intere&s;t, and afterwards the debt extingui&s;hed by Money lent them by the States, &s;or payment of which a particular Impo&s;ition was granted on all Goods brought from <HI>Turky,</HI> until the Debt to them was cleared, with an Intere&s;t of one <HI>per cent.</HI> for the year. By which it may be ob&s;erved, how little are e&s;teemed the Per&s;ons of Chri&s;tian Repre&s;entatives in the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Court; who having proved with what tamene&s;s &s;ome Princes have taken the affronts offered to the Per|&s;on of their Amba&s;&s;ador in former times, and now ob&s;erving with what patience the States of <HI>Hol|land</HI> have &s;u&s;tained the like in&s;olence and injury in their Re&s;ident, they may po&s;&s;ibly profe&s;s their Function &s;acred, but yet in matters of their own intere&s;t will never be induced to vouch&s;afe them that re&s;pect or ju&s;t treatment which is due to them.</P>

<P>IN the preceding year we declared how a Peace was concluded between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Algier:</HI> For better confirmation whereof, and &s;e|curity of our Merchants E&s;tates in the <HI>Levant,</HI> upon occa&s;ion of a future breach, it was judged nece&s;&s;ary by His Maje&s;ties Council, That the re|&s;pective Articles la&s;t made and concluded with <HI>Algier, Tunis,</HI> and <HI>Tripoli,</HI> &s;hould be di&s;tinctly
<PB N="137" REF="72">de&s;cribed and ratified by the Grand Signior, with this Clau&s;e at the Conclu&s;ion of each, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>That in ca&s;e the foregoing Articles were not kept by the&s;e his Subjects re&s;pectively, but &s;hould con|trary to the meaning thereof through Piracy be broken, that then it &s;hould be lawful for the King of <HI>England</HI> to cha&s;ti&s;e tho&s;e People by his own Arms and Force, without Impeachment or Breach of that good Peace and Amity which Intervenes between His Maje&s;ty of Great <HI>Britain</HI> and the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Emperor:</Q> And this was &s;up|po&s;ed might always be a Plea in defence of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation in <HI>Turky,</HI> when at any time His Maje&s;ty provoked by the Injuries of tho&s;e faithle&s;s and piratical Nations, &s;hould take due Revenge upon them, not only on the Seas, but al&s;o on the Land, &s;ubverting tho&s;e very Cities and Fortre&s;&s;es, which are the Ne&s;ts of Piracies, and the common Cha&s;ti&s;ement and Gaols of Chri&s;tendom. When the&s;e Articles came to the hands of His Maje&s;ties Amba&s;&s;ador the Earl of <HI>Winchel&s;ea,</HI> with Orders to have them ratified and &s;ub&s;cribed in the manner foregoing, the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Court was then at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> to which place on this occa&s;ion the Lord Amba&s;&s;ador made a Journey from his u&s;ual Re&s;idence at <HI>Con&s;tan|tinople;</HI> and having acquainted the <HI>Chimacam</HI> with the whole matter, and the Propo&s;itions rightly apprehended by him, they were offered, and the next day communicated in behalf of the Amba&s;&s;ador to the Grand Signior, who readily promi&s;ed compliance with His Maje&s;ties de&s;ires, ordering the Articles and Conclu&s;ion of them, to be ingro&s;&s;ed and prepared for the Imperial A&s;&s;ent. How&s;oever &s;ome con&s;iderable time ran on before they were delivered out, in regard that being matters of State relating to War and Peace, they could not be fully granted without Privity and Knowledg of the Grand Vizier, who was the &s;upreme Coun&s;ellor, and therefore we were forced to attend thirty five days before an Expre&s;s could go and return from the Frontiers with the An&s;wer expected, which was as ea&s;ily granted by the Vizier, as before it was entertain|ed by the Grand Signior. On <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 5. the Con|firmation of the &s;everal afore&s;aid Articles were con&s;igned unto my &s;elf in pre&s;ence of our Lord Amba&s;&s;ador by the hands of the <HI>Chimacam,</HI> being my &s;elf de&s;igned in Per&s;on to deliver them; for which Service a Frigat of His Maje&s;ties Navy at|tended at <HI>Smyrna:</HI> &s;o that very Evening I depart|ed, and arrived at <HI>Smyrna:</HI> the <HI>15th</HI> of <HI>Augu&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>In my Journy from <HI>Adrianople</HI> to <HI>Smyrna,</HI> omit|ting the Geography of the Countries, and the plea&s;ent view I had from the top of a Mountain between <HI>Malagra</HI> and <HI>Gallipoli,</HI> from whence I could &s;urvey all the <HI>Helle&s;pont,</HI> and at the &s;ame time take a pro&s;pect of the <HI>Propontick</HI> and <HI>Ionian</HI> Seas, I &s;hall only relate two pa&s;&s;ages which be|fel me in this Journey, not unplea&s;ant to be re|membred.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t was at a &s;mall Village called <HI>I&s;hecle,</HI> at the foot of the Mountain <HI>Ida,</HI> not far from the Ancient <HI>Iroy,</HI> now named by the <HI>Turks Kauzdog,</HI> which &s;ignifies the Mountain of Gee&s;e; the Peo|ple that inhabit here, are of a rude Di&s;po&s;ition, great Thieves, and of a wild and &s;avage Nature; at my entry thereupon I was advi&s;ed by tho&s;e that were with me, that it was nece&s;&s;ary to take Mules to carry my Baggage through the Moun|tains, and to pre&s;s the People to convoy me to the next Government by Virtue of a Command the Grand Signior had granted me for the &s;ecu|rity of my Travels; &s;o that arriving at this place by break of day, I went directly with all my Attendance, being about eighteen or nineteen Hor&s;e, to the <HI>Kadi</HI>'s Hou&s;e, where knocking hard at the Door, a Servant looked out at the Win|dow, and &s;pying &s;o great a company, wholly affrighted, ran to his Ma&s;ter, and awakening him with &s;uch dreadful news, he had &s;carce any Soul or Life remaining to render an An&s;wer; for he was one of tho&s;e, who three times a day was u&s;ed to take his Do&s;e of <HI>Opium,</HI> which gave him a &s;trange kind of Intoxication or Drunkenne&s;s; during the Operation of which, men have their Spirits violently moved and agitated, that after|wards it leaves them &s;o wearied and languid, that in the morning when they fir&s;t awake, they remain like dead Stocks, their Members are be|numbed, and can &s;carce turn from one &s;ide to the other. In this conidtion the News of new Gue&s;ts &s;urprized this <HI>Kadi,</HI> when wholly feeble he called to his Servant to reach him his Box of <HI>Opium,</HI> of which when he had taken his u&s;ual Propotion, and that it began to work, his Life returned a|gain to him and he began immediately to reco|ver, &s;o that he had Courage to open his Gates and receive us in: when he had read the Com|mand, and found no hurt in it, the Man was tran|&s;ported with Joy and <HI>Opium,</HI> and was &s;o kind, chearful, and of a good humour, that I could not but admire at the change; he told me, that he lived in a barbarous Country, and was &s;orced to u&s;e that for Diverti&s;ement and as a Remedy of his melancholly hours. I ea&s;ily perceived the effect it had upon him, for he &s;eemed to me like a Bed|lam; in which humour he called all his Neigh|bours about him, and after a wi&s;e Con&s;ultation, they provided me with two Mules, and five Men on foot with ru&s;ty Muskets without Powder or Shot, to guide and guard me through the Moun|tains. I had not travelled two Miles before all my Guard were &s;tollen a&s;ide, and taking advan|tage of the Woods and Mountains, were fled from me, &s;o that I found my &s;elf with no other than my own People, in an unbeaten Path, and a way unfrequented; the man excepted who drove the Mules, who for &s;ake of his Bea&s;ts was obliged to a farther attendance. We travelled in this manner through the Mountains about four hours, when near a Village called <HI>Suratnee,</HI> we met one of the Principal men on Hor&s;e-back, carrying a flead Mutton behind him, which upon Exami|nation we di&s;covered to be carried for a Bribe to the <HI>Kadi</HI> of <HI>I&s;heclee,</HI> that &s;o he would be his Friend, and favour him in his Cau&s;e: And further upon inquiry, finding that our Entertainment was likely to be mean at <HI>Suratnee,</HI> we forced the Gentleman to return with us, and to &s;ell us his Mutton at the market-price, and &s;o for that time we di&s;appointed our <HI>Kadi</HI> of his Fee or Reward: and being upon the ri&s;e of a Hill de&s;cending to <HI>Suratnee,</HI> &s;o that the People could &s;ee us at a di&s;tance, they like true Sons of <HI>Kauz-dog</HI> for|&s;ook their Habitations, and fled, which we per|ceiving po&s;ted after them, and catched two of their men, whom we brought under Shart, (or the Country-mans Oath, which they account very &s;acred, and will by no means break) to be true and faithful to us, to &s;erve, and not leave us for &s;o long time as we &s;hould remain in their Village, and accordingly the&s;e men were not only &s;erviceable, but diligent: &s;o &s;oon as they di&s;covered me to be one who would pay ju&s;tly for what I took, and was not a <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Aga, or Servant of Great men who harra&s;s the People, and take their Service and Meat on account of free Quarter, the whole Village returned again from their places of Refuge amid&s;t the Woods, &s;o that I neither wanted Provi&s;ions nor Atten|dance.</P>
<PB N="138" REF="73">
<P>Another pa&s;&s;age happened unto me of better Civility and Entertainment in the Plains of <HI>Per|gamus,</HI> where not many Miles from that Ancient City. I arrived about &s;ix a Clock in the Evening at certain Tents or Cots of Shepherds, being on|ly Hurdles covered with Hair-cloth, lined within with a &s;ort of loo&s;e Felt, a &s;ufficient defence again&s;t the Sun and Rain; the <HI>Turks</HI> call the&s;e People <HI>Euruchs,</HI> and are Shepherds who with their Wives, Children and Cattel, Live and Inha|bit, where they mo&s;t delight, or like the Shepherds of Ancient days, remove their dwellings to tho&s;e Places where they find mo&s;t plenty of Water and Pa&s;ture. Among&s;t the&s;e Cors &s;o &s;oon as I alight|ed from my Hor&s;e, I was received and &s;aluted by the Aga or Chief, with great Humanity and Kindne&s;s; for &s;o &s;oon as he under&s;tood who I was, and that I was imploied in publick Affairs, he pre&s;ently places me under &s;ome neighbouring Trces, and called for Carpets and Cu&s;hions to &s;it on, which were more Fine and Rich, than agreed with the outward appearance of Men wholly unaccu&s;tomed to a City-life. After &s;ome Di&s;|cour&s;e had with me, which I remember to have been very Courteous and Inqui&s;itive of my Condi|tion and Bu&s;ine&s;s, he provided Provender for our Hor&s;es, and in a &s;hort time ordered Bread and Eggs to be brought for to &s;tay my Stomach, &s;uppo&s;ing that hard Travels had &s;harpened my Appetite. About an hour after that, he invited all my Company, and then we fed very plenti|fully of &s;everal Di&s;hes, which the good Hou&s;|wives had dre&s;&s;ed within the Precincts of their poor Tents; whil&s;t the Shepherds had in the Field killed a lat Kid, and were then roa&s;ting it whole at the &s;uel of a Tree which they had fell'd; this Roa&s;t-meat they cut into quarters, and with Bread and Salt put it into a Linen-cloth, deliver|ing it to one of my Servants for our Breakfa&s;t the next morning. Having thus well refre&s;hed my &s;elf with the Charity of the&s;e good Shepherds, I aro&s;e with the Moon about eleven a Clock at Night; but before my Departure, I demanded what I had to pay; to which the generous Shep|herd replied, That my Acceptance was a &s;uffici|ent Payment, for that all Men were obliged to be Civil and Ho&s;pitable to Men who travelled the World like me for publick Service; and withal de&s;ired me to &s;peak well, where&s;oever I came, of &s;uch poor Men who led their Lives in the Fields, who were in&s;tructed in the&s;e Principles, <HI>viz.</HI> to hurt none, and to be humane and helpful to all Mankind.</P>
<P>In a few days after my Arrival at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> I imbarked on the <HI>Bonaventure</HI> Frigat, Command|ed by Capt. <HI>Berkeley,</HI> afterwards Sir <HI>William Berke|ley,</HI> and &s;haping our cour&s;e fir&s;t for <HI>Tripoli</HI> in <HI>Barbary,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tripoli.</NOTE> we came to Anchor before the Town the <HI>29;</HI> and immediately going a&s;hore, we were conducted to the Pre&s;ence of the Pa&s;ha of that Country, whom I acquainted with the occa&s;ion of this Addre&s;s, delivering into his hands two Copies of the late Treaty of Peace, one confirmed by the Hand and Seal of His Maje&s;ty our Gracious So|veraign, and the other of the Sultan; both which he received with &s;ingular Re&s;pect and Re|verence, promi&s;ing to maintain the Peace &s;acred and inviolable; and &s;o being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed fairly from him, we &s;peedily repaired on Board, and &s;etting Sail again that Night with a pro&s;perous Gale, we anchored in the <HI>Bay</HI> of <HI>Tunis</HI> on the &s;econd of <HI>September;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tunis.</NOTE> and the next day being landed, we in the fir&s;t place made our Addre&s;&s;es to the <HI>Dey,</HI> who bears the Office of Prince or Governor in chief, tho in the <HI>Arabian</HI> Language the word &s;ignifies as much as Uncle, to whom I tendred the Confirmations of Peace in the &s;ame form and manner as before at <HI>Tripoli:</HI> the <HI>Dey</HI> received them with Re&s;pect and Honour, promi&s;ing to continue the Peace; that part which was from our King, he received him&s;elf; but that which was from the Grand Signior he advi&s;ed me to deliver to the Pa&s;ha; for coming from his Ma&s;ter, it might more nearly concern him than any other; the Pa&s;ha having &s;een and read, the Hatte&s;heriff returned it again to the <HI>Dey</HI> to be placed among&s;t the Records and Regi&s;ters of the Divan, and &s;o making a Vi&s;it to all the great Men in Power, giving them notice of our Bu&s;ine&s;s, that &s;o none might take Exceptions, or judg them&s;elves neg|lected for want of Addre&s;&s;es; we the &s;ame Night departed from <HI>Tunis,</HI> and proceeded forward in our Voyage to <HI>Algier.</HI> But before we arrive there, I have time to acquaint the Reader of the Pe&s;tilential Fever which then affected our whole Ship. When we departed from <HI>Smyrna,</HI> we had fourteen Sick of the Autumnal Di&s;temper, but be|fore ten Days, we had ninety five out of a hun|dred and &s;ixty Men, which lay Sick on their Beds and Hamocks; and we &s;eared &s;o general a Weak|ne&s;s, that we &s;hould not have had Strength &s;uffi|cient to have Sailed our Ship; for I think there was &s;carce any among&s;t us in perfect Health. But God &s;hewed his Strength in our Weakne&s;s, &s;o that in ten Days, having buried nine of our Men, he was plea&s;ed with the change of our Climate, to renew our Health, and in An&s;wer to our Prayers, as it were by a Miracle, to re&s;tore us to all the Health, and Strength, and Comfort, that we could de&s;ire.</P>
<P>At <HI>Algier,</HI> that Den of Thieves, and Harbour of Faithle&s;s Men, and all Impiety, we arrived the <HI>10th</HI> of <HI>September,</HI> where immediately with a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Con&s;ul, we de&s;igned to tender the Confirmations of the Peace unto the Divan, then the &s;upreme and Ab&s;olute Power. But whil&s;t we imagined the Peace firm, and improbable that tho&s;e Articles which were concluded and agreed but the la&s;t Year, &s;hould &s;o ea&s;ily and &s;oone be forgotten; we found the Scene of Affairs greatly altered, and fears of an unexpected Rup|ture; for the Ships of <HI>Algier</HI> roving in the Seas, had lately &s;ent in nine &s;mall <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;els with|out a Pa&s;s from the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> for want of which, they pretended by a new Agreement they ought to be prize; of which, &s;ix by means of the Con&s;ul being relea&s;ed, three only remained under Detention at our Arrival; when immediately we applied our &s;elves to <HI>Shaban</HI> Aga, a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Renegado, then Cape or Chief of their confu&s;ed Divan; to him we fir&s;t di&s;clo&s;ed the import of our Me&s;&s;age, and &s;hewed the Confirmations of our Peace &s;ub&s;cribed by the King of <HI>England,</HI> and the Grand Signior. After he had read them, a Divan was called, and the Confirmations openly publi&s;hed; at which time it was a&s;&s;ented and agreed, that the Articles ought to be maintained, and the Peace continued; but to have this e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by firm Authority, it was farther referred to the Great Divan, which is a Grand A&s;&s;embly of the People, who u&s;ually meet together every <HI>Saturday</HI> of the Week. In the mean time, ha|ving had an Acquaintance formerly with the Pa|&s;ha of this Place, &s;ent hither by the Grand Signi|or, we were de&s;irous to make him a Vi&s;it, the better to di&s;cover in what nature they Honour and own the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Port; but before we could be admitted to his Pre&s;ence, we were obliged to demand Licen&s;e of the Divan, which they granted with &s;ome unwillingne&s;s, and with the caution of two or three Witne&s;&s;es of our Di&s;cour&s;e. We were &s;carce welcomed into the Room, and the u&s;u|al
<PB N="139" REF="73">Salutations pa&s;&s;ed, before we were interrupted by the Officers, and not &s;uffered to proceed; &s;o little e&s;teem they made of the Pa&s;ha, to whom not|wit&s;tanding they allowed twelve thou&s;and Dol|lars a Year for his Maintenance, &s;o as to carry the fair and &s;pecious out&s;ide at the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Court, of receiving a Pa&s;ha from thence; but were &s;o far from permitting him to intermeddle in the Government that they confined him like a Pri&s;o|ner not &s;uffering him to &s;tir Abroad without Per|mi&s;&s;ion and Con&s;ent of the Divan, and that ve|ry &s;eldom, tho he often pleaded his Health was much impaired by his Re&s;traint, and craved Enlargement, rather for nece&s;&s;ity than his Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The Day of the great Divans A&s;&s;embly being come, the Confirmations of the Peace was again read, and well approved, and &s;o laid up in the Repo&s;itory of their Writings; and promi&s;e made us for Relea&s;ement of our Ships. But let us now ob&s;erve the levity and un&s;teadine&s;s of this popu|lar Government; for being the day following appointed to receive our di&s;patches,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The un|con&s;tancy of the po|pular Go|vernment at <HI>Algier.</HI></NOTE> and di&s;charge of the three Ships; there aro&s;e unexpectedly at the Divan, certain Scruples and Jealou&s;ies among&s;t them, which immediately qua&s;hed all our Nego|tiations, and in&s;tead of confirming the Peace, produced a War. For the Divan being met, they were afraid to relea&s;e the Ships, le&s;t the Sol|diers who had &s;ent them in, being then abroad, &s;hould call them to que&s;tion for it at their re|turn; and not to relea&s;e them, might be an oc|ca&s;ion of a War; which not &s;ucceeding accord|ing to their de&s;ire, the cau&s;ers thereof might be called into que&s;tion, and puni&s;hed for it; of which &s;till remained the fre&s;h memory of late Examples. In this <HI>Dilemma</HI> of their Affairs, they re&s;olved to make the Act herein, to be of general and publick A&s;&s;ent; and to that end they A&s;&s;embled a Grand Divan, calling the Captains of Ships and Gallies, then in Fort, unto their Council; who without He&s;itation, or que&s;tioning other Matters, decla|red, that the three <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships were lawful Prize; and that it was no longer requi&s;ite to maintain the &s;econd Article of freeing Strangers Goods on <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;els; it neither being the de&s;ign nor intere&s;t of <HI>Algier,</HI> to benefit all Chri|&s;tendom by their Peace with <HI>England:</HI> this Sen|tence was followed by the whole Rabble of the Divan, with cry and noi&s;e; to which the wi&s;er &s;ort, notwith&s;tanding our Plea, and Rea&s;ons to the contrary, which la&s;ted for full two hours, were forced to conde&s;cend, and concur in the &s;ame Vote. How&s;oever by Importunity, and &s;ome|thing of the force of Rea&s;on, which in the mo&s;t blind and ob&s;cure minds of Men, hath &s;omething of forcible Violence; we obtained the relea&s;e of the three Ships, upon di&s;charge of the Strangers Goods, and payment of their Freight. But the &s;econd Article of Peace, forbidding the &s;earch of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships for Strangers E&s;tates, or their Per&s;ons, was declared null, and no longer to be maintained; nor the Peace likewi&s;e, unle&s;s His Maje&s;ty would accept it upon that Con|dition, to which end, they wrote this following Letter.</P>

<HEAD>The Letter of the Government of <HI>Algier</HI> to His Maje&s;ty.</HEAD>
<P><HI>GReat and Chri&s;tian Prince, King of</HI> Eng|land. <HI>After Health and Peace,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Since we have made Peace with You, unto this day there have no Injuries nor Damages been offered by &V;s. Your Ships that have been as Prizes, for Your &s;ake we have let free, not offering them the lea&s;t Injury, nor dimini&s;hing any thing from them in the lea&s;t, until &s;uch time as Your Con&s;ul gave &V;s Counter-pa&s;&s;es, that what Ships were found with them, to be let free, and tho&s;e that are without them, to be brought in: And we have found divers without them, which for Friend&s;hip &s;ake which is between &V;s, We have let go free. Now from henceforth, if that we find any of our Enemies Goods or Men in Your Ships, we &s;hall take the Goods and Men, paying the Freight to their Port. And we &s;hall de&s;ire you, as &s;oon as you &s;hall receive this our Letter, that you will &s;end your an&s;wer hereunto, for we &s;hall think it long until we receive it from You; and for the future, what Ships &s;hall be brought in without a Pa&s;s-port, we &s;hall take them, and detain them here, until &s;uch time as we have an an&s;wer from You; which pray &s;end without delay. The end of the Month</HI> Sefar, 1074. <HI>which was then in the Month of</HI> Septem|ber, 1633.</P>
<P>In this manner a &s;econd War broke forth in the &s;pace of two Years, by which a Per&s;on may judg of the incon&s;tancy and un&s;teady humour of this People; who but three days before, gave us all the evidence of fair Corre&s;pondence and Friend|&s;hip; and it is probable, that when they entered the Divan, they came not with Re&s;olutions or Thoughts of War; however accidents and occa|&s;ional Di&s;cour&s;es each with other, following the cry and humour of &s;ome rude Savage Per&s;on, which leads the re&s;t, carried all things with Vio|lence towards a Breach: So that by what preced|ed, and from the&s;e following Rea&s;ons, it may be concluded impo&s;&s;ible to maintain a firm and la&s;t|ing Peace with this People.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Becau&s;e the&s;e People are compo&s;ed of the wor&s;t Sort or Scum of the <HI>Turks,</HI> and wor&s;t of Chri&s;tians, which are Renegadoes, who have renounced God and their Country, and a Ge|neration of People who have no Religion, nor Honour; Peace cannot be longer expected or maintained, than fear or intere&s;t enjoins them to compliance.</P>
<P>Secondly, The Government of <HI>Algier</HI> being popular, and in the hands of a vile Commonal|ty, who are ignorant Per&s;ons, guided by no Rules or Principales; un&s;teady in all their Coun|cils, not re&s;olving or con&s;ulting any thing be|fore they enter the Divan, do commonly fol|low that Re&s;olution, which they perceive to be carried on with the greate&s;t noi&s;e; and therefore are a People not capable of Peace or Friend|&s;hip.</P>
<P>Thirdly, This irrational Commonalty is over|awed by a heady Soldiery, who are only then affrighted into a Peace, whil&s;t a &s;tronger force compels them into good Manners. But when that Power and Puni&s;hment is withdrawn, they again harden their hearts like <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> and then when the Temptation of rich Merchant-men pre&s;ents it &s;elf, their natural Inclination to Piracy returns, and their Covetou&s;ne&s;s again prevails, an then they cur&s;e the Peace, and the makers of it, and without remor&s;e break their Articles, and their Faith, having neither Honour nor Con|&s;cience to re&s;train them. Wherefore unle&s;s the
<PB N="140" REF="74">Heads of the chief Cau&s;ers of the War he given in &s;atisfaction, or Money paid for the expence, and Ho&s;tages given for &s;ecurity of it, it can never be expected that a la&s;ting Peace &s;hould be maintain|ed with this People; the Proof of which, hath been made appear by the &s;equel of affairs, and by tho&s;e Wars which have en&s;ued &s;ince this time.

<HEAD>The Proceedings of the War in <HI>HUNGARY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE le&s;t the Grand Vizier on his March to|wards the parts of <HI>Hungary,</HI> with an Ar|my, as computed, to con&s;i&s;t of Eighty Thou&s;and fighting men, and of about Seventy Thou&s;and de&s;igned for Pioniers and other nece&s;&s;ary &s;ervices of the Army. In this march the Vizier out of de&s;ign to &s;lacken the warlike Preparations of the Chri&s;tians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Vi|zier de|&s;ires a Treaty to amu&s;e the Chri&s;tians.</NOTE> and to di&s;cover the inclinations of the Emperor to Peace, de&s;ired a Treaty, that if po&s;&s;ible, matters might be reduced to terms of ac|commodation. The Re&s;ident of <HI>Germany,</HI> was then in the Army, but he, not being impowered &s;ingly for any &s;uch Treaty, the Baron of <HI>Goez,</HI> then with <HI>Ali</HI> Pa&s;ha at <HI>Teme&s;war,</HI> was &s;ent for, and being arrived, were both called into the Viziers Tent at <HI>Belgrade,</HI> to whom it was propo&s;ed, That in Ca&s;e the Emperor de&s;ired a Peace, he &s;hould re&s;ign into the hands and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Sultan <HI>Zekelhyd, Zatmar, Clau&s;enburg,</HI> alias <HI>Colo&s;var,</HI> with the late built Fort of Count <HI>Serini,</HI> without which, no Sacrifice could appea&s;e the anger, and give a &s;top to the progre&s;s of the <HI>Ottomon</HI> Arms. Whil&s;t the&s;e Propo&s;itions by Po&s;t were di&s;patched to <HI>Vienna,</HI> the Vizier proceeded in his Journey to <HI>Strigonium,</HI> now called <HI>Gran,</HI> to which placer, af|ter &s;ixteen Days time, the Me&s;&s;enger returned with an An&s;wer from the Emperor, which &s;howed an inclination towards an acceptance of Peace on the terms propo&s;ed, but with in&s;tructions to his Mini&s;ters to moderate by their di&s;creet manage|ment (what was po&s;&s;ible) the rigour of the de|mands. For by rea&s;on of the di&s;affection of the <HI>Hungarians,</HI> whom the Emperor had lately di&s;|gu&s;ted by demoli&s;hing &s;everal of their Churches, and di&s;countenancing the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Religion which they profe&s;&s;ed; and by rea&s;on of the Phlegm of the Princes of <HI>Germany,</HI> whom diffe|rent intere&s;ts made &s;low and unactive in their preparations again&s;t the common Enemy; the Emperor was wholly unprovided to oppo&s;e the viloence of this over-flowing Torrent, and be|came an unequal match for the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Force. The <HI>Turks</HI> perceiving that the <HI>Germans</HI> began to conde&s;cend, and yield to any conditions, which might purcha&s;e their quiet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This Tri|bute was paid by the Em|peror to Sultan <HI>So lyman.</HI></NOTE> &s;tarted a farther de|mand of Fifty thou&s;and Florins of Yearly Tribute, and two Millions of Crowns for expence of the War, to be paid by the Emperor to the Sultan. The&s;e proud and unexped Propo&s;als &s;tartled not a little the Baron of <HI>Goez,</HI> who readily made an|&s;wer, that he clearly perceived now, that there were no intentions to a Peace, &s;ince the Vizier was plea&s;ed to make the matter &s;o difficult and impo&s;&s;ible, for that it were as ea&s;y to bring Hea|ven and Earth to meet, as his Ma&s;ter to meet the G Signior in the Conce&s;sion of this particular. The&s;e extravagant demands a wakened the Impe|rial Court, who now ob&s;erving the <HI>Turks</HI> without their Vizard, to march ha&s;tily to &s;urprize them, vigorou&s;ly rou&s;ed them&s;elves to make that con|venient provi&s;ion and defence by War, which the &s;traitne&s;s of time permitted them: So that in the fir&s;t place they A&s;&s;embled a Diet at <HI>Ratisbonne,</HI> where it was re&s;olved to rai&s;e four Armies, the fir&s;t for the Guard and defence of <HI>Moravia</HI> and <HI>Sile&s;ia,</HI> under the Command of Count <HI>Su&s;a,</HI> a Native of <HI>Rochel.</HI> The &s;econd under the Com|mand of Count <HI>Raimond Monteculi,</HI> for &s;afety of <HI>Raab, Newhau&s;el,</HI> and <HI>Komorra,</HI> and the Frontiers of <HI>Hungary.</HI> The third under Command of Count <HI>Nicholas Serini</HI> for defence of <HI>Croatia.</HI> The fourth compo&s;ed &s;olely of <HI>Hungarians,</HI> command|ed by the Palatine of that Country, which they reported to con&s;i&s;t of Thirty thou&s;and fighting men. Fifthly, It was ordered that all Gari&s;ons &s;hould be well provided of Victuals and Ammu|nition; and that the Inhabitants of <HI>Vienna</HI> &s;hould take into every Hou&s;e a provi&s;ion for a years maintenance, and &s;uch as were not able at their own Co&s;t, were to abandon their Dwellings. And in the mean time the Villages round about were demoli&s;hed, to the great amazement and confu|&s;ion of the People.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> now bearing in their thoughts no|thing but War, began to de&s;ign and chalk out the be&s;t order and method for its pro&s;ecution. The principal places then in eye of the Vizier, were <HI>Raab,</HI> and <HI>Komorra,</HI> Fortre&s;&s;es of con&s;iderable &s;trength, maintained and defended by Souldiers of known prowe&s;s and conduct, and provided equally with all &s;orts of Ammunition and Provi|&s;ions, agreeable to &s;uch con&s;iderable Bulwarks and Walls, not only of the <HI>German</HI> Empire but (I may &s;ay) of all Chri&s;tendom <HI>Raab.</HI> called by the <HI>Ita|lians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Raab.</NOTE> <HI>Javarin,</HI> and by the <HI>Turk, Yanick,</HI> is &s;cituated in a plain, level, and Champion Country; the Town it &s;elf very regular and compact, the Fortifications mo&s;t exact according to the new model. and much improved in its &s;trength &s;ince the recovery of it from the hands of the <HI>Turk,</HI> by whom it was once taken, in the year 1594. it hath its name from the River <HI>Rab,</HI> on which it is &s;eated ju&s;t on the meeting of the <HI>Danube.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Komorra.</NOTE> <HI>Komorra</HI> is a &s;tronger Fortre&s;s, erected in an I&s;land of the River <HI>Da|nube,</HI> called after the &s;ame name, which hath often been attempted by the <HI>Turks,</HI> but with ill &s;ucce&s;s; at both which places I have per&s;onally been, and viewed them with much delight. Wherefore the Vizier con&s;idering the &s;trength. and difficulty of the&s;e places, re&s;olved to take due and mature con&s;ideration before he engaged him&s;elf in any enterprize, and to that end a&s;&s;em|bled together in Con&s;ultation with him the mo&s;t ancient and grave men, that were Natives of the Country; &s;ome of the&s;e being &s;uch who had lived in <HI>Rab,</HI> been Slaves there,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> deliberate of the me|thod to be u&s;ed in War.</NOTE> and had well marked and ob&s;erved the &s;trength of that Fortre&s;s both as to Nature and Art, a&s;&s;ured the Vizier, That the Work was immen&s;e, difficult, and dangerous, and not to be accompli&s;hed in the &s;pace of one Summer; and that the Winters in that Countrey were very cold and rigid, and ill agreeing with the temperament of the A&s;iatick Souldiery. The Vizier, though the farther con&s;idered that his Souldiers were as yet young and unexperienced, and that a foyl encountred at the fir&s;t Enterprize, might be a di&s;couragement from following the con|tinued Tract and Cour&s;e of this War, which mu&s;t be &s;u&s;tained with labour and patience, and that to withdraw his Forces in the Winter would be a di&s;honour to the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Arms, a blemi&s;h in the beginning to his own Reputation, and an encou|ragement of the Enemy: How&s;oever, having a
<PB N="141" REF="74">violent Ambition and De&s;ire to become Ma&s;ter of <HI>Rab,</HI> he could not re&s;t &s;atisfied in this Coun&s;el before he had con&s;ulted with <HI>Ali</HI> Pa&s;ha, and other Pa&s;haws of the Frontier Countries, who duly con&s;idering the matter as it &s;tood, concur|red in the &s;ame judgment that was formerly made of the difficulty of this de&s;ign; and herein they were the more &s;trongly confirmed, by the re|port of certain <HI>Hungarians,</HI> whom &s;ome parties of Hor&s;e, under the Command of <HI>Ali</HI> Pa&s;ha, ro|ving and &s;allying out near the Walls of <HI>Rab,</HI> had &s;urprized and taken, who being brought bound before the Vizier, related, That the Town was well provided with all &s;orts of Ammunition and Provi&s;ions, and the Gari&s;on reinforced by Count <HI>Montecuculi</HI> with &s;upply of four Thou&s;and men, and in this manner reported the Work as difficult as the <HI>Turks</HI> of the Countrey had formerly &s;igni|fied. This relation confirmed by &s;o many hands, diverted the Viz er from this De&s;ign: for before that time imagining it a place which might ea&s;ily be &s;ubdued, he propo&s;ed to him&s;elf, without any interruption, a clear and undi&s;turbed March to the Gates of <HI>Vienna,</HI> which he &s;wallowing al&s;o in his thoughts, hoped by his own &s;ucce&s;s to repair the &s;hame of <HI>Solyman</HI>'s flight from the Walls of that City, and be&s;ides the glory of forcing the Emperor from his Imperial Seat, he &s;hould atone for the &s;in of the <HI>Ottomon</HI> Cow|ardice, and be the fir&s;t who undertook to mend the actions, and outvie the prowe&s;s of the mo&s;t magnificent, and mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful of their Sultans. But the Ambition of this grand de&s;ign giving way to nece&s;&s;ity, and to tho&s;e other im|pediments which ob&s;tructed it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">New|hau&s;el</NOTE> after due and mature Con&s;ultation, <HI>Newhau&s;el,</HI> called by the <HI>Hungariaus Oywar,</HI> was fixed upon as the place to be fir&s;t attempted, and held up to the eye of the Souldiery, as the reward and prize of their va|lour and hazard. Wherefore Boats were pro|vided, and Planks, and Timbers for a Bridge to pa&s;s the <HI>Danube,</HI> which the <HI>Turks</HI> in a few days, according to their u&s;ual expeditions, had rai&s;ed; &s;o that the Army both Hor&s;e and Foot began to tran&s;port them&s;elves as fa&s;t as was po&s;sible to the other &s;ide, but the multitudes crouded over in that di&s;order and ha&s;te, that Three or four Thou|&s;and men had &s;carce pa&s;&s;ed the River before the Bridge was &s;o broken and &s;hattered that &s;ome time was nece&s;&s;arily required to repair it, before the re&s;t of the Army dur&s;t adventure to follow their Companions. The Approach of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Army alarmed all that &s;ide of <HI>Hungary,</HI> but e&s;pe|cially the Inhabitants of <HI>Newhau&s;el;</HI> who ob|&s;erving the <HI>Turks</HI> to bend their Cour&s;e that way, plainly fore-&s;aw the Storm of VVar to be break|ing on them: The News al&s;o of the fall of the Bridge, and thereby the Separation of a|bout Four thou&s;and <HI>Turks</HI> from the Body of the Army,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Forcatz</HI> the Gover|nour of <HI>Newhau|&s;el,</HI> ill ad|vi&s;es a Sally.</NOTE> was brought in by the Countrey people, who for&s;aking their Villages, fled for &s;uccour to the &s;tronger Fortre&s;s of <HI>Newhau&s;el.</HI> Hereupon <HI>Forcatz,</HI> the Governour of <HI>Newhau&s;el,</HI> a valiant and experienced Souldier, though e&s;teemed by the <HI>Turks</HI> unfortunate, taking this Alarm, judged that this occa&s;ion of cutting off that part of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Army which had pa&s;t the River, was in no wi&s;e to be omitted, and therefore a&s;&s;embled a Council of VVar, which con&s;i&s;ted of all the prin|cipal Officers and Commanders of the Gari&s;on; (a|mong&s;t which was Colonel <HI>Volter,</HI> that command|ed the Four thou&s;and men, lately &s;ent to rein|force the Town) he declared that his Opinion was, immediately to make a Sally on that part of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Army, which had already pa&s;&s;ed the River, before the Bridge was repaired for Tran&s;portation of the others; which endea|vours, by God's A&s;si&s;tance, &s;ucceeding well, might not only di&s;courage the Enemy, but be a means to divert them from their pre&s;ent de&s;ign upon their City. This Advice, thought he pre&s;|&s;ed with heat of Argument, and violence of Speech, yet could it not prevail with the re&s;t of the Council, which &s;eemed wholly aver&s;e there|unto, e&s;pecially <HI>Volter,</HI> who declared, That his Commi&s;&s;ion was not to fight in the Field, but to con&s;erve him&s;elf within the Walls, for mainte|nance of his Gari&s;on: Some days pa&s;&s;ed in this Di&s;pute, whil&s;t <HI>Forcatz</HI> growing more eager and hot on this de&s;ign, u&s;ed opprobrious Terms, and expre&s;sions of infamy towards the other Officers, accu&s;ing all &s;uch of Cowardice and Trea&s;on, who refu&s;ed to concur with him in this Enterprize and advantage on the Enemy, which Heaven &s;eemed to reach out to them for their Delive|rance, if their wi&s;dom and courage afforded them only will and grace to lay hold on the op|portunity. The&s;e &s;harp words and re&s;olution of the Governour provoked the minds of the Offi|cers to a conde&s;cention, and thereupon about Eight thou&s;and men of Choice, and approved Souldiers, well armed with &s;trout hearts, and hard Jron; not &s;uffering them&s;elves to be up|braided with &s;uch reproach, in the &s;ilence of the Night, under the Conduct of <HI>Forcatz,</HI> (their own Commander, <HI>Volter</HI> remaining in the Town) took their way towards the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Camp, and being armed with Firelocks, marched with all privacy, without lighted Matches, or &s;ound of Drum or Trumpet. But whil&s;t the forgoing Di&s;pute la&s;ted, the <HI>Turks</HI> had tran&s;ported the gro&s;s of their Army over the River, and then lay on her Banks,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fortcatz</HI> &s;urpri&s;es the <HI>Turk|i&s;h</HI> Camp.</NOTE> re&s;ting &s;ecurely undre their Pavillions. The Chri&s;tians approaching near the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Camp, with the fir&s;t twilight, and dawnign of the Morning, (perceiving the Enemy unprovid|ed, but not di&s;covering their Force) dealt at fir&s;t on-&s;et, their &s;hot mo&s;t plentifully among&s;t them, and proceeding amid&s;t the thicke&s;t, cutting, &s;hooting, killing, and making havock of all be|fore them. The amazed <HI>Turks</HI> having many of their Companions brought to their la&s;t &s;leep, before them&s;elves were throughly awake, and &s;ome flying before they di&s;covered the rea&s;on or the danger, an Alarm was given by the confu|&s;ed murmur of <HI>Allah, Allah,</HI> and that the Chri|&s;tians were upon them, reached the farthe&s;t Quarters of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Army, which immediate|ly put them&s;elves into Battalia, and order of fighting, whil&s;t this handful of <HI>Germans</HI> proceeded forwards, dealing their blows among&s;t their Ene|mies, cutting the Cords of the Tents, and de&s;troying all before them. But by this time the <HI>Turks</HI> ha|ving put them&s;elves into a po&s;ture of Defence, the Hor&s;e and Foot came marching in a Body, extending their Wings in the from of a half Moon, &s;o as to enclo&s;e this &s;mall number,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Ger|mans</HI> are routed, and fly.</NOTE> and on all &s;ides to a&s;&s;ail them.

In the mean while the mo&s;t &s;u|per&s;titious among&s;t them triumphed, that God was now de&s;troying the Infidels, manife&s;ting the truth of their Prophet, and doing his own work; not unlike the a&s;&s;ertions and doctrines of tho&s;e pretenders to Religion, who have always hal|lowed and excu&s;ed their cruelties with the Name of God, and &s;anctified the blood they have &s;hed by making their Enemies <HI>Amalekites,</HI> and by pre|tence of fal&s;e Lights and Prophecies countenan|ced their mo&s;t impious Sacriledge in God's Churches, and Inva&s;ions of their Neighbours Rights. The mercile&s;s Executioners had pro|ceeded to bereave of life about Thirteen or Four|teen hundred per&s;ons, the Vizier &s;tanding a Spectator with zeal to his Sect and Prophet, un|til the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Souldiery who inhabit the Borders, glutted with &s;o much cruelty towards their Neighbours, began to murmur, and at length to &s;peak aloud, That to de&s;troy Captives in cold Blood was an action again&s;t the Law of Arms, and might be revenged by their Enemies with like examples of cruelty, &s;ince none there pre|&s;ent, being all Souldiers, were &s;ecure from the misfortunes and mutabilities of War. The Vi|zier over-hearing the&s;e whi&s;pers of the Soldiery, gave a &s;top to the cruelty of the Executioners, and &s;ent &s;uch as &s;urvived to different Pri&s;ons in <HI>Buda, Ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ianople,</HI> and <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> I have &s;een not far from <HI>Strigonium</HI> the heads of the&s;e Wretches thus mi&s;erably butchered, thrown up into a heap, the Beards and Hair of tho&s;e that lay undermo&s;t &s;till growing; the Earth which &s;ucked in their blood, became thence &s;tenched up and barren, and the white bones and carka&s;&s;es of their bodies lay di&s;per&s;ed and &s;cattered in a large Field; &s;o that I could not but call to mind the ma&s;&s;acred Legions under the Conduct of <HI>Quintilius Varus</HI> in <HI>Germany;</HI> and tho&s;e <HI>albentiao&s;&s;a,</HI> and the bar|barous Altars flowing with the <HI>Roman</HI> blood; and I could as pa&s;&s;ionately fancy to have &s;een the an|gry <HI>Germans</HI> return to appea&s;e the Gho&s;t; of their Country-men with decent Burial, as I was &s;en|&s;ible of <HI>Germanicus</HI> in zeal, when he adventu|red to contaminate his Augurs Office by his too forward Humanity and Religion towards his Country and Parentage.

<PB N="145" REF="76">
<P>In this manner all places &s;eemed to fall down and yield at the very rumour of the <HI>Turks</HI> ap|proach; for not only <HI>Leventz</HI> &s;urrendred it &s;elf, but likewi&s;e <HI>Nitra,</HI> though over-topped by a &s;trong and an impregnable Ca&s;tle, was by the Cowardice of the Commander betrayed at the fir&s;t Summons of the <HI>Turks;</HI> for which action, the Captain afterwards, by expre&s;s Command of the Emperor, &s;uffered Death.</P>
<P>After all the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es, though no oppo&s;ition appeared in the Field, to ob&s;truct the luxuriant and wanton march of the victorious Squadrons of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Army; and not only <HI>Hungary,</HI> but <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> and the lower <HI>Germany</HI> was Alarmed and terrified with the rumour of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> num|bers; and though the Vizier (as it is &s;aid) began this War with the ambitious thoughts of po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ing <HI>Vienna</HI> it &s;elf, and out-vying the Acts of <HI>Soly|man</HI> the Magnificent: Yet it &s;eemed &s;trange, that being come thus far, and almo&s;t in pro&s;pect of his hopes, that he &s;hould give a check to his Fortunes, and not advance towards <HI>Vienna,</HI> to which now the pa&s;&s;age &s;eemed wide and open; but it was almo&s;t a miracle, that he &s;hould not make a Vi&s;it to <HI>Po&s;&s;onium,</HI> before which, had he only di&s;plaid his dreadful Arms, it had &s;urren|dred at his fir&s;t Summons and Apearance.

Wherefore rai&s;ing his Camp, he employed a con&s;iderable Party to take <HI>Novigrade,</HI> a Ca&s;tle &s;cituated on a high Rock, encompa&s;&s;ed with a Ditch of 34 Foot deep,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Novigrade</HI> taken by the <HI>Turks.</HI></NOTE> Gari|&s;oned with Six hundred Soldiers, and provided &s;ufficiently with Victuals and Ammunition; how|&s;oever by ill fortune, and wor&s;e Conduct, this place al&s;o was re&s;igned into the hands of the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>By this time the Winter approaching,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Vi|zier re|treats to his Winter Quarters.</NOTE> and the &s;ea&s;on of the Year beginning to be unfit for action, the Great Vizier retreated as far as <HI>Belgrade,</HI> to take up his Winter Quarters with the gro&s;s of his Army: Where remaining with full &s;atisfaction and glory, contemplating the &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the pa&s;t Year, and promi&s;ing to him&s;elf greater renown, and exaltation of his mighty acts, for that in&s;u|ing; he &s;o contemned the Force of his Enemies, that he Licen&s;ed great numbers of the <HI>A&s;ian</HI> Spa|hees, who came as far as from <HI>Baylon</HI> and Grand <HI>Cairo,</HI> to return home to their own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.

<P>THE Month of <HI>January</HI> was now well entred with its rigid Fro&s;ts, when <HI>Apafi</HI> Prince of <HI>Tran&s;ilva|nia,</HI> beholding his Souldiers in their Winter Quarters, and all things quiet and &s;till about him, judged it &s;ea&s;onable for his e&s;tabli&s;hment to di&s;|cover him&s;elf with &s;ome lu&s;tre to the World, &s;eated in the u&s;ual Throne of the <HI>Tran&s;ilvanian</HI> Princes; which &s;ight appeared &s;o univer&s;ally grate|ful to the People, that they began to be ena|moured of their Prince, and to applaud his Per|&s;on, his Prowe&s;s and Vertues, and to ca&s;t an ill and envious Eye on tho&s;e Cities which were Gar|ri&s;on'd with <HI>German</HI> Souldiers. About which time the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Zechelhyd</HI> revolted from Obe|dience of the Emperor unto <HI>Apafi</HI> the Prince:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Zechlhyd <HI>revolts to</HI> Apafi.</NOTE> For the Souldiery of that Garri&s;on having long Ar|rears of pay due to them, made a Mutiny, and expelled their Collonel <HI>Dempenbal</HI> from his Office, and pillaged his Hou&s;e, placing the Quarter-Ma|&s;ter of <HI>Strozzi</HI>'s Regiment in his &s;tead. The news of this Sedition flew quickly to <HI>Vienna,</HI> from whence immediately a Me&s;&s;enger was di&s;patched with an Act of Pardon from the Emperor, upon &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and proffers of full &s;atisfaction of all Arrears: but the Souldiery finding them&s;elves on|ly paid with words, hearkened to the more ef|fectual Propo&s;itions of <HI>Apafi,</HI> who taking hold of this opportunity, &s;ent every Souldier ten Dol|lars with a Suit of Cloaths, promi&s;ing larger and more con&s;tant Pay than they received from the Emperor, with which the Garri&s;on being &s;atisfied, &s;urrendred up their City on the <HI>20th</HI> of <HI>January.</HI> But whil&s;t other Armies remained in their Quar|ters, and other Commanders gave them&s;elves up to ea&s;e, and drowned them&s;elves in Wine and Banquets; and whil&s;t Jealou&s;ies, Envies, and Ce|remonies, di&s;turbed and confu&s;ed the re&s;olves of Diets and private Councils; the generous and vigilant <HI>Serini,</HI> having received advices from <HI>A|drianople,</HI> that the <HI>Turks</HI> de&s;ign in the next Cam|pagna, was to convert the whole heat and fury of the War upon <HI>Croatia,</HI> and through that Country to open a pa&s;&s;age unto <HI>Friuli;</HI> his active &s;pirit conceived that heat and flame, that the Winters cold could not chill his hot and eager de&s;ires from entring into the open Field, and com|mencing &s;ome attempt and enterprize on his E|nemy. Wherefore on the <HI>16th</HI> of <HI>January,</HI> he began his march from <HI>Serin&s;war,</HI> with an Army of about 25000 men; and in the fir&s;t place, marching along the Banks of the <HI>Dravus,</HI> &s;hewed him&s;elf before <HI>Berzenche;</HI> which upon conditions of marching away with Arms, Bag, and Bag|gage, was &s;urrendered to him. <HI>Bakockza</HI> was likewi&s;e yielded, and a Palancha on the Ri|ver quitted upon report of the Counts ap|proach, leaving behind them Eight bra&s;s Guns in the Fort. From hence he marched towards <HI>E&s;&s;eck,</HI> otherwi&s;e called <HI>O&s;eck,</HI> which is the only pa&s;s from the upper to the lower <HI>Hun|gary,</HI> having a Bridge of Wood over a Moor or Fen, about &s;ix or &s;even miles in length, which once I remember, with my Hor&s;e, I was an Hour and three quarters in pa&s;&s;ing (as I

Dol|lars, and &s;ix years time to build; imagining that to rebuild it again, was a Work of that time, as could not be repaired in one Summer, and that by this means the <HI>Turks</HI> would be di&s;appointed of all Action the following Year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bridge burned.</NOTE> and the Empire have time to breathe, and a&s;&s;emble the utmo&s;t of their Strength and Force together; wherefore ta|king opportunity of the hard Winter, when the Mar&s;h was frozen, and a &s;trong Wind to carry the Flame; he &s;ent before him 2000. Dragoons, and 3000. Croats, which encountring 6000. <HI>Turks</HI> at the foot of the Bridg, &s;et for Guard of that place, were &s;o ill treated by them, that they had been wholly cut off, had not a con&s;iderable Force of Hor&s;e and Dragoons come in to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, by who&s;e Re&s;olution they not only routed the <HI>Turk,</HI> but took the <HI>Palancha,</HI> which was the Defence of the Bridg, and having gained it in hot Blood, put all to Fire and Sword; after which, Fire being &s;et to the Bridg in divers places, in a &s;hort time it was con&s;umed, and re|mained in A&s;hes. The news of this Exploit was received at <HI>Vienna</HI> with great Joy; believing that for the following Year, they had di&s;appointed the <HI>Turks</HI> of a Pa&s;&s;age; but by the &s;equel it will appear, how much they erred in the account made of the Diligence of the <HI>Turks,</HI> who in forty days repaired that which they e&s;teemed a work of &s;ome Years; and as I ob&s;erved, it was all built of new Timber, and on another Foundation dif|ferent from the old. From this place <HI>Serini</HI> marched to <HI>Quin&abque; Eccle&s;iae,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Quinq&punc; Ec|cle&s;iae <HI>ta|ken by</HI> Serini.</NOTE> or <HI>Five Kirk,</HI> at who&s;e near approach, the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;et out a white Flag on one of the Towers, &s;ignifying a de&s;ire of Parly, as if they had had intentions to &s;urrender on Terms and Articles of Agreement; the Chri|&s;tians with this Confidence marched near the Walls, where the <HI>Turks</HI> e&s;pying their Advantage on their Enemies now under command of their Guns, fired upon them, and did &s;evere Execution, killing among&s;t others, &s;everal principal Officers, of which were General <HI>Hammerling,</HI> and Count <HI>Harber&s;tein;</HI> which perfidious Action &s;o tran&s;port|ed <HI>Serini,</HI> that he re&s;olved on a furious A&s;&s;ault, and performed it with that Gallantry, that on the <HI>5th</HI> of <HI>February</HI> he took the Town by Storm and Force of Arms, and in Recompence of their treacherous Stratagem, put all the Inhabitants to the Sword, and gave up the Town to the Pillage and Plunder of the Souldiery, and aftewards &s;et|ting it on Fire, rendred it the mo&s;t horrid Specta|cle of Fire and Sword that had as yet been &s;een or known in this pre&s;ent War.</P>
<P>The&s;e Succe&s;&s;es of <HI>Serini</HI> gained him the Repu|tation of a valiant and fortunate Prince, and his liberal hand in frankly be&s;towing the Booty and Pillages among&s;t the Soldiery, invited great num|bers to follow his Banner. His active Spirit and Vigilance gained him likewi&s;e a Reputation among&s;t the <HI>Turks,</HI> that their principal Fear and Dread was of <HI>Serin-Ogli,</HI> as of a watchful and politick Enemy; for in every place he made great Havock and Spoil, being reported to have laden two thou&s;and five hundred Carts with Slaves, Goods and Ammunition, and to carry with him an hundred fifty five Pieces of Cannon taken out of &s;mall Forts and <HI>Palancha</HI>'s, and to have laid wa&s;te all the Country between the <HI>Dravus</HI> and the <HI>Danube.</HI> In the&s;e Incur&s;ions, and victorious and dreadful Travels through the Enemies Country, the valiant <HI>Serini</HI> at length arrived at <HI>Sigeth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sigeth <HI>Be|&s;ieged.</HI></NOTE> a Fortre&s;s con&s;i&s;ting of a new and old Town conjoyned by a Bridg which cro&s;&s;es a famous Mar&s;h or Fen, ennobled by the Attempt made thereon by <HI>Solyman</HI> the Magnificent in the year 1565. with an Army of &s;ix hundred thou&s;and Men; in defence of which <HI>Nicholas Serini,</HI> the great Grandfather of the pre&s;ent Count, im|mortalized his Fame and Memory with the lo&s;s of his Life, and renowned the Place it &s;elf by his Feats at Arms. At this place <HI>Serini</HI> was re|&s;olved to revenge the Blood of his Ance&s;tors, and &s;acrifice great numbers to the Gho&s;t of his Grandfather; to which end he &s;ent the Count <HI>Olack</HI> before him with part of his Army, to Sum|mon the Enemy, and prepare the way to his own more effectual Force; <HI>Olack</HI> had ordered all things accordingly, when <HI>Serini</HI> full of Glory and Spoils arrived him in his Leagure, and joyn|ing together, appointed a day for a general Storm; but whil&s;t the&s;e things were meditating, and that <HI>Sigeth</HI> was reduced almo&s;t to the la&s;t Extremity, advice came of the near approach of a Body of twelve thou&s;and <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tar|tars;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Siege rai&s;ed.</NOTE> to encounter which, the Attempt was ac|counted difficult, con&s;idering the lo&s;s and diminu|tion of the Chri&s;tian Forces, which by continual Actions, and the bitter Sufferings of the Winter Sea&s;on, were reduced to a number inferior to that of their Enemies; and wanting all &s;orts of Provi|&s;ion and Ammunition, it was re&s;olved, as mo&s;t expedient, to rai&s;e the Siege, which was the next day performed, and the Sold<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ery taken into Gari&s;ons to Repo&s;e and Recruit them&s;elves.

For <HI>Claudiopolis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Claudiopo|lis</HI> yields it &s;elf to <HI>Apafi.</HI></NOTE> which not many years pa&s;t had defended it &s;elf &s;o valiantly again&s;t the <HI>Turks</HI> under the Command of the Governor <HI>Retani,</HI> did now, wanting pay, (the Sinew and Life of the Soldiery) follow the late Example of <HI>Zechel|hyd,</HI> and &s;urrendred it &s;elf into the hands of <HI>Apafi;</HI> and tho the Complaints and Murmurings of the Soldiers gave a &s;ufficient time of warn|ing to make due Provi&s;ions again&s;t a Misfortune &s;o imminent and plainly appearing; yet the want of Expedition at <HI>Vienna,</HI> and the unprofitable Application only of empty Words and Air to feed the penury, and &s;atisfie the Appetite of &s;tarving Men, was a Remedy &s;o little avail|able, that the Gari&s;on &s;ubmitted to <HI>Apafi,</HI> and yielded to Conditions whereby they might Eat and Live: the Story of which Place, compa|red with that of <HI>Zechelhyd,</HI> was &s;o &s;hameful and pungent to Men capable of any impre&s;|&s;ions of Honour or Duty, that at length it awakened the <HI>Germans,</HI> and admoni&s;hed them to provide better for <HI>Zacmar</HI> and <HI>Tockey,</HI> and o|ther Frontier Gari&s;ons, le&s;t they al&s;o &s;hould incur the like Fate and Misfortune with the two for|mer.</P>
<P>By this time the Actions of <HI>Serini</HI> were rumour|ed in the Grand Signiors Seraglio, and the re|port of them became common in the mouths of the Vulgar; wherefore full of Anger and Di&s;|dain, the Sultan wrote &s;everely to his Vizier, re|proving him of negligence for &s;uffering <HI>Serini</HI> &s;o freely to Range his Countries without controul, to the great Di&s;honour of his Empire, and Damage of his People: whereupon the Vizier not as yet having received his Recruits, nor pre|pared &s;o early for the March of the gro&s;s of his Army, di&s;patched notwith&s;tanding a con&s;ide|rable Force to precede him, with Orders either by &s;tealth to &s;urprize <HI>Serin&s;war,</HI> or el&s;e to lay Siege unto it.

The matter was this: Count <HI>Strozzi</HI> being admitted to his Audience,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Count <HI>Strozzi</HI>'s Speech to the <HI>French</HI> King.</NOTE> &s;o &s;oon as he entered into the Cham+ber, I know not whether it was feigned or real, he &s;eemed to be &s;truck with &s;uch an Amazement and Fear, that for a while he was not able to pronounce a word Articulate or Intelligible; but at length recollecting him&s;elf, he began with a trembling Voice to excu&s;e this He&s;itation of his Speech, having his Sen&s;es di&s;&s;ipated, and his Eyes dazled with the Rays and Splendor of &s;o much Maje&s;ty; and with that, as in a Rapture or Ec|&s;ta&s;ie broke out into an Admiration of the <HI>French</HI> Monarchy, the report of who&s;e Greatne&s;s and Glory, tho arrived to the utmo&s;t Confines of the Univer&s;e, came yet far &s;hort of that real Maje&s;ty which he &s;aw and admired, who&s;e dreadful and my&s;terious Throne was &s;ufficient to revive the dead A&s;hes of the <HI>Sabean</HI> Queen to pro&s;trare her &s;elf before this new <HI>Solomon,</HI> much excelling the Wi&s;dom, the Riche&s;s, the Virtue, and Happine&s;s of the former. And thence de|&s;cending with the like &s;agacious Ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s, to confute the malicious Reports of malignant Tongues, who, envious of the harmony of Chri|&s;tian Spirits, repre&s;ented His Maje&s;ty as ill-affe|cted to the <HI>Au&s;trian</HI> Family; whereas to the contrary, he could te&s;tifie to have found that exce&s;s of Affection, and admirable Di&s;po&s;ition in His Maje&s;ty towards the Emperor his Ally, as rendred his Emba&s;&s;y abundantly happy and &s;ucce&s;sful, which joined to the Zeal His Maje|&s;ty had towards the Chri&s;tian Cau&s;e, was like Friend&s;hip united to Charity, and moral Virtues made perfect by &s;piritual Qualifications. In fine, he compared his Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty to that Glo|rious Sun, which communicating his light to the Chri&s;tian World, affords the mo&s;t benign Influence to the Catholick Climate; with much better rea&s;on therefore ought <HI>Germany</HI> to par|ticipate &s;o great a Circle of tho&s;e Rays, as may &s;erve wholly to ob&s;cure and darken the dim and barbarous Light of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Moon.

Nor was <HI>Serini</HI> more &s;uce&s;sful in his per&s;wa&s;ions to a&s;&s;ault the Enemy, whil&s;t they were wearied with their March, and bu&s;ied in ex|tending their Tents, the other Generals being of opinion, that it was too great a hazard for them alone to venture their Forces in &s;o unequal a Combat, by they ought rather to expect <HI>Mon|tecuculi,</HI> by the addition of who&s;e Forces the lot of War would be le&s;s hazardous, if not wholly certain. In this manner great Enterpri&s;es have been di&s;appointed, which have wanted only re|&s;olution to make them &s;ucce&s;sful, Fortune being commonly favourable, if not a Servant, to bold and daring Spirits; the di&s;union al&s;o of Generals hath been the overthrow of the wi&s;e&s;t Coun&s;els, and Wars have been ov&s;erved never to have thrived where the Heads of Armies have been of di&s;&s;enting humors or different intere&s;ts.</P>

<P>In this interim General <HI>Montecuculi</HI> arrived with his Army, and was received by Count <HI>Se|rini</HI> with all evidences and demon&s;trations of re|&s;pect and hearty welcome, and between both pa&s;&s;ed an appearance at lea&s;t of friendly corre|&s;pondence. But as to the pre&s;ent Engagement, <HI>Montecuculi</HI> was of opinion. That the opportuni|ty was over &s;lipt, which &s;hould at fir&s;t have been performed, rather by way of &s;urprize than open Battel, before the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Army had arrived to its full numbers, con&s;i&s;ting now of an hundred thou&s;and fighting men. To which rea&s;ons <HI>Seri|ni</HI> replied, That the Chri&s;tian Cau&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Serini</HI>'s Rea&s;ons to fight with the <HI>Turks.</HI></NOTE> and the States and Confines of the Empire were not to be maintained by men that carry their thumbs at their girdles, or by Armies made re&s;ty with ea&s;e, and wanton with luxury. That tho&s;e Ar|mies were rai&s;e not to con&s;ume and exhau&s;t the Revenues of their Princes, and Exchequers of their States, without making &s;atisfactory amends by a valiant defence of that Intere&s;t which they owned. That the Enemy had not been before that time attempted, was no fault or neglect of his, who under the very Walls of <HI>Kani&s;ia</HI> re|&s;olved to give them Battel; but that the other Generals &s;uppo&s;ed it more prudence and caution to protract the Engagement till his Arrival, who being now happily conjoyned with them, nothing ought to deter them from a glorious Attempt on the <HI>Turks,</HI> who not con&s;i&s;ting of above Thirty thou&s;and men, ill di&s;ciplined, and wor&s;e armed, were not able to with&s;tand the prowe&s;s of their Veterane Army, which far exceeded them in num|ber, di&s;cipline, and courage.

At which lo&s;s of men, and time, and the ill &s;ucce&s;s near <HI>Lewa,</HI> the Vizier being greatly moved, made another attempt on the <HI>27th</HI> of <HI>July;</HI> advancing with the Gro&s;s of his Army as far as <HI>Kemend,</HI> where the River runs narrow and &s;hallow, but by the valour of the <HI>Hungarians, Germans,</HI> and <HI>French</HI> conducted by General <HI>Montecuculi,</HI> an <HI>Italian</HI> Born, were re|pul&s;ed with &s;ome Slaughter.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t of <HI>August,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turk,</HI> with part of their Army pa&s;s the <HI>Rab.</HI></NOTE> the <HI>Turks</HI> made ano|ther con&s;iderable attempt, having planted Guns on the Banks of the River, which &s;hot into the Chri&s;tian Camp, and pa&s;&s;ed over in one place Six thou&s;and Jani&s;aries and <HI>Albanians,</HI> and near a Village called <HI>Chiesfalo,</HI> where the Water was narrow and &s;hallow, very con&s;iderable numbers of Hor&s;e crouded over. At which formidable &s;ight, the Chri&s;tians collecting their Forces to|gether, retreated to a more &s;pacious place, where might be open Field &s;ufficient for both Armies to draw up and join Battel. About half the Army having now pa&s;&s;ed the Water, the other part, in which was the Vizier, remained &s;till on the other &s;ide, intending the next Morn|ing to follow and advance to the Body, which was gone before; but it happened, by God's Pro|vidence, that that very Night there &s;ell &s;uch a Deluge of Rain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Rab</HI> &s;wells with im|moderate Rains.</NOTE> as immediately made the River to &s;well above its Banks, and become altogether unpa&s;&s;able without a Bridge or Floats; &s;o that the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Army being now divided by the Wa|ters, were uncapable of yielding any &s;udden a&s;&s;i&s;tance each to the other. How&s;oever, the Vi|zier judging that that part of his Army which had already pa&s;&s;ed, was an equal Match for the Chri&s;tians, entertained not the lea&s;t diffidence of good &s;ucce&s;s, at lea&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed they might be able to decline a Battel, until by abatement of the Waters (which could not be long at that Sea&s;on of the Year) he were enabled to pa&s;s, and join his main Body with them; and therefore full of hope and confidence, having at fir&s;t di&s;|comfited
<PB N="157" REF="82">the forlorn hope of the Chri&s;tians, which con&s;i&s;ted of a thou&s;and men, di&s;patched immediately Me&s;&s;engers to acquaint the Grand Signior of his &s;ucce&s;s and pa&s;&s;age, which News he knew would be the more grateful, becau&s;e the Grand Signior by daily Letters and Com|mands urged him to proceed in his March, and not to &s;uffer the impediment of a narrow Ditch to be an interruption to the whole <HI>Ottoman</HI> Force, which in former times was not re&s;trained by the depth or breadth of the Ocean. The Grand Signior having received this Intelligence, as if the intire Victory and Triumph over the World con&s;i&s;ted in the pa&s;&s;age over the <HI>Rab,</HI> was tran&s;ported with &s;uch an extraordina|ry joy and a&s;&s;urance of Victory, that to antici|pate the good News a &s;olemn Fe&s;tival was or|dained for the &s;pace of &s;even days, and &s;even nights, called by the <HI>Turks, Dunalma;</HI> in which time the whole nights were made light with Lamps and Candles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> vain joy.</NOTE> and made chearful with great Guns, Vollies of Muskets, Sound of Drums and Trumpets, revellings and what other So|lemnities might te&s;tifie joy and triumph. But &s;carce three Nights of this vain Dream had pa&s;|&s;ed, before the Grand Signior awaked by intel|ligence, contrary to his a&s;&s;ured expectation, of the Defeat and De&s;truction of a con&s;iderable part of the Viziers Army, &s;hamefully commanded the Lights to be extingui&s;hed, and the remain|ing four Nights de&s;igned for Joy, to be convert|ed to Melancholly and Darkne&s;s: And though the ra&s;hne&s;s and vain &s;ancy of the Governours was the &s;ole cau&s;e of this precipitate mirth, yet as great men love always to charge their errours and follies on the &s;houlders of others, &s;o the Sul|tan accu&s;ed the Chimacham, through fal&s;e In|formation, to have been the Author of this &s;hameful Decree; and in that fury, calling the Executioner, had certainly taken off his head, had not his young Minion or Favourite, now called <HI>Kul Ogli</HI> (promoted to the Perferment of <HI>A&s;an,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Signi&s;ies the Son of a <HI>Kul,</HI> or Slave.</NOTE> before mentioned) with much ear|ne&s;tne&s;s and Prayers interceded for his Life.</P>
<P>And indeed this Joy and Triumph was &s;o|much more ridiculous and &s;hameful, by how much more fatal and de&s;tructive was the en&s;uing Event. For the <HI>Turks</HI> being now got over the River, had not, at fir&s;t, time enough given them to ca&s;t up Earth, but were &s;orced by the Chri|&s;tians to an Engagement; for the Chri&s;tian Army was drawn into Batalia to receive them.

Wing of the Chri&s;tians, and in other places they made attempts, only to divert the Army, whil&s;t the Ja|ni&s;aries threw up Earth to &s;ecure a pa&s;&s;age for the re&s;t; which when the Chri&s;tians e&s;pied, they at fir&s;t re&s;olved to &s;ound a Retreat, but after|wards perceiving that the Trench was but new|ly begun, <HI>Montecuculi</HI> drawing up the Body of the Army into a half Moon, attacked the Jani&s;a|ries on all &s;ides with that fury, ordering the Bo|dies of Hor&s;e to contend with the Spahees; that the <HI>Turks</HI> now faintly fighting began to give ground to their Enemies, at which in&s;tant turn of Fortune, an outcry was heard, That <HI>Serini</HI> on the other &s;ide had &s;et on the Viziers Camp; which &s;o animated the Chri&s;tians, and terrified the <HI>Turks,</HI> that the latter began to give back, and put them&s;elves to &s;hameful flight, leaving dead upon the Place Eight thou&s;and of their Companions, and the Glory of the Day to the Chri&s;tians.

<P>The News of this Victory being po&s;ted to <HI>Vi|enna,</HI> it is wonderful to con&s;ider with what Ap|plau&s;es, with what Honours, with what <HI>En|comiums</HI> the Fame of <HI>Montecuculi</HI> was celebra|ted; for be&s;ides the Triumphs, with Fires, &s;ound|ing of Bells, Banquets, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">d other demon&s;trations of &s;olemn Joy; the Glory of <HI>Montecuculi</HI> was the Theme of every Ballad &s;ung in the corners of &s;treets; which Honours of the Commonalty were &s;econded by greater and more &s;ub&s;tantial of the Imperial Court, who conferred upon him the Title of Lieutenant General of the whole Army, a Dignity &s;o eminent as is inferiour to none, except the Emperor, in order of the Militia; and was not without &s;ome &s;cruple granted to the Arch|duke <HI>Leopold</HI> by his Brother <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Third; and withheld from <HI>Piccolomini</HI> Duke of <HI>Amalfi,</HI> until he had highly merited it, and made his way to it through bloody fields, where Provi|dence fir&s;t crowned him with Laurels of Succe&s;s and Victory.</P>
<P>And here is ju&s;t occa&s;ion for us to doubt, why <HI>Montecuculi</HI> &s;hould be thus admired and loaded with Honours, whil&s;t the &s;ervices of <HI>Serini</HI> and <HI>Soi&s;e</HI> were &s;o far from being taken notice of, that they &s;eemed to effect the di&s;grace and ruine of the&s;e Worthies, rather than to produce the fa|vour of their Prince, and the applau&s;e of their Country, the natural Rewards of Valour and Virtue. And indeed I cannot but confe&s;s, I my &s;elf have wondred, when in the Court of <HI>Vienna,</HI> I have heard the Actions and Zeal of <HI>Serini</HI> &s;o &s;lightly &s;poken of, or contemned, when a Stran|ger took the liberty but to de&s;cant on his acti|ons, and to vent any thing which but &s;avoured of his commendations.

The fir&s;t is, that Antipathy or natural aver&s;ion the <HI>Germans</HI> have to the <HI>Hungarians</HI> and <HI>Croatians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rea&s;ons why the Services of <HI>Montecu|cul&igrave;</HI> were accepted better than tho&s;e of <HI>Serini.</HI></NOTE> the&s;e endeavouring to maintain the Priviledges of a People, who have a free liberty of the Election of their Prince; whil&s;t the others de&s;irous to take occa&s;ion to weaken and impoveri&s;h them, would nece&s;&s;i|tate them to yield their Kingdom to the Empe|ror by an hereditary Right. The &s;econd is, the fury of <HI>Serini</HI> and <HI>Soi&s;e,</HI> who&s;e zeal without con&s;ideration of irritating the <HI>Turk,</HI> or fear of moving the pa&s;&s;ion of the Lyon beyond the terms of an ea&s;ie pacification, tran&s;ported them to com|mit all damage and ruine, which are the ju&s;t concomitants of War; which rage &s;eemed o|ver violent to the Court at <HI>Vienna,</HI> and not to &s;uit with the pre&s;ent Policy of the War, which was de&s;igned to be carried on rather in a defen|&s;ive than in an offen&s;ive po&s;ture; imagining per|haps, that the good nature of the <HI>Turk</HI> might be complemented into Peace, and that gen|tlene&s;s and genero&s;iry might have the &s;ame ef|fect upon them, as it had upon <HI>Saul,</HI> when <HI>Da|vid</HI> had his life at his mercy, and yet &s;pared him: according to which coun&s;els of the Court, <HI>Montecuculi,</HI> &s;quaring every particular of his mo|tion, and thereunto adding &s;ucce&s;s, mounted on the wings of Fame, and had his Glory celebrated without diminutions; but the hot and zealous temper of <HI>Serini,</HI> which Souldier-like under&s;tood nothing but down-right blows, knew not how to u&s;e that moderation and caution, which the Im|perial Court judged an ingredient &s;o requi&s;ite to the prudent management of the pre&s;ent War, that he was e&s;teemed uncapable of command, who had not di&s;cretion enough to practice it: And this was the true rea&s;on that <HI>Serini</HI> was di&s;coun|tenanced, and that his Command was taken from him, and that his Appeal to the Court was without redre&s;s: How&s;oever in regard that the Fame he had won carried him high in the e&s;teem of all Chri&s;tendom, he was entertained with hopes and fair promi&s;es; and even after the very Sattel of <HI>Rab,</HI> nothing was more commonly di&s;|cour&s;ed than the giving <HI>Nicholas Ser<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="3 letters"></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> com|mand independent of any other General.

<P>This opinion was rooted with much &s;uper&s;tition and &s;trength of fancy in the minds of the Vulgar: And the rumors in the Camp that the Vizier upon a fal&s;e Alarm of the approach of the Enemy to|wards his Quarters, had commanded the Army to

On what con&s;ideration &s;oever it might be, the Grand Signior having &s;pent &s;ome time abroad, return|ed again to <HI>Adrianople</HI> with all his Retinue, with|out doing any thing more important than kil|ling great numbers of wild Bea&s;ts, and enno|bling tho&s;e Wilderne&s;&s;es and Woods about <HI>Yam|boli</HI> with the fame of his renowned Hunting. <HI>Ke|blelee</HI> Pa&s;ha being &s;lain (as we have &s;aid) before <HI>Serin&s;war,</HI> who was Husband to the Viziers Si&s;ter, the Vizier be&s;towed the Widow on <HI>Hu&s;aein</HI> Pa&s;ha of <HI>Sili&s;tria.</HI> And much about the &s;ame time the Grand Signior con&s;idering that his own Si|&s;ter, by the death of her old Husband <HI>I&s;hmael</HI> Pa&s;ha, &s;lain in the la&s;t Battel, led a &s;ingle life, conferred her in Marriage upon the old <HI>Maho|met</HI> Pa&s;ha, whom before we have related to have been <HI>Kahya</HI> to the Vizier, late Pa&s;ha of <HI>Dar|biquier,</HI> and now of <HI>Aleppo,</HI> who as an Honour charged with a weight of troubles and other in|conveniences, &s;eemed thankfully to receive her; and though he was a man of Ninety years of age, and had long &s;ince forgot the &s;olaces of the bridal Bed, yet according to the cu&s;tom of Marriage with a Sultana, he was ingaged to divorce his for|mer Wife, with whom he had pa&s;t the Summer and Winter of his age, and as a con&s;tant Husband, was &s;till uxorious in his love.

<P>At <HI>Strigonium</HI> great were the Con&s;ultations, what cour&s;e was to be taken: The Chri&s;tians were now Ma&s;ters of the Field, and the <HI>Turks</HI> di&s;|couraged, and now the Summer was &s;o far &s;pent, that it was too late to think of recovering their reputation that year with the hazard of a Battel.

<P>On the&s;e Terms (of which none &s;eems di&s;|advantageous to the Chri&s;tian Intere&s;t, unle&s;s the fourth Article, the di&s;honour of which &s;eems to be covered with the name of <HI>Apafi,</HI> though the &s;core was paid by the Emperor) the Peace was e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the Vizier, as a beginning there|of, gave liberty to many Chri&s;tian Captives; &s;ome whereof were of Quality, and Proclama|tion was made through all the Confines for a Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms. How&s;oever, &s;ome petty mat|ters remained undecided, which were deferred until the Arrival of an extraordinary Amba&s;&s;a|dour, who was to exchange with the <HI>Turks</HI> ano|ther Amba&s;&s;adour in the Month of <HI>May</HI> follow|ing; and in the mean time &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of Arms, and all other Ho&s;tilities was confirmed. At which News all &s;orts of People among&s;t the <HI>Turks</HI> were greatly rejoyced, and the Publica|tion thereof the more welcome, by how much the more unexpected. Whereby we may ob|&s;erve the alteration of that ancient Martial di&s;po|&s;ition, which was natural to this Empire, which whil&s;t it was exerci&s;ed in War, grew hardy, active and inured to warlike exerci&s;e, but now through idlene&s;s and want of War (except the <HI>Venetian,</HI> which affords the Soldiery no con&s;ide|rable employment) their minds became re&s;ty, wearied with one year and a halfs labour, and dejected with the unpro&s;perous &s;ucce&s;s of one Summer.</P>

<PB N="161" REF="84">and yet all <HI>Germany</HI> enjoyed the benefit. That that Town was an appendage to the Kingdom of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and to which the Emperour having on|ly the claim (as they pretended) of an Elective Prince, could not di&s;member any part without con&s;ent of the States thereof; and this po&s;ition they maintained with that heat and fury, that they declared them&s;elves di&s;obliged from ob&s;er|vation of the Articles, re&s;olving to vindicate their own right in de&s;pight of all oppo&s;ition what&s;oe|ver; and that &s;ince the Emperour had undertaken their Protection, he was bound to a&s;&s;ert their freedom, and defend their Cities, even with the expence of his own Trea&s;ury, and at the hazard of his own hereditary Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. But to the&s;e ex|orbitant Demands, the Emperours Council reply|ed with the&s;e following rea&s;ons and moderation; That they them&s;elves were the fir&s;t Beginners and Promoters of this War; That His Maje&s;ty at their in&s;tance and reque&s;t conde&s;cended to pro|tect them as Subjects, not only with draining of his own Exchequer, and Blood of his Patrimoni|al Dominions, but with the charge of hired and mercenary Strangers. In the mean time what a&s;&s;i&s;tance had the Hungarians brought to this War, or to their own defence? What Contributions did they ever make? What Forces did they e|ver unite in the Field by a general a&s;&s;ent of their whole Kingdom? Notwith&s;tanding his Maje&s;ty was ready to continue the War, could they them|&s;elves propo&s;e either a &s;afe way for the mainte|nance of it, or that the pre&s;ent Conjuncture did not offer honourable Conditions of a happy Com|po&s;ure. Moreover,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Em|perors Rea&s;ons for a Peace.</NOTE> That the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> his Uncle, and Father in Law, being aged and de|crepit, leaving no other Heir than an infirm and &s;ickly Child, to &s;upport the charge and weight of all his Kingdoms, it was requi&s;ite that at &s;uch a time as this, he &s;hould be free from all incum|brances, either to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Infant in Admini&s;tra|tion of the Government, or to a&s;&s;ert his own Rights (if &s;o it &s;hould plea&s;e God) in the Suc|ce&s;&s;ion. And that now, &s;ince a Treaty was on foot for Election of a Succe&s;&s;or to the Kingdom of <HI>Poland,</HI> it was nece&s;&s;ary for his Imperial Ma|je&s;ty to bear his part in that Tran&s;action; but above all, it was con&s;iderable, That the common Enemy being Rich and Powerful, God had &s;eem|ed to put his Victory into their Hands to no other end than to improve it unto a Peace, which being at this time neglected, the be&s;t that could en&s;ue would be the mi&s;eries of War, which turning on the incon&s;tant Wheel of Fortune with variety of &s;ucce&s;&s;es, is always attended with Slaughter, Captivity, Fire, Sword, and a thou&s;and other Calamities.

<P>The &s;udden News of this unexpected Peace did in like manner affect the French King, and the States of the Empire, judging it unrea&s;onable for them to be intere&s;&s;ed in the War, and yet un|concerned in the Conclu&s;ion of the Peace. How|&s;oever, things being well repre&s;ented, and as well received and under&s;tood; his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje|&s;ty accepted of the Rea&s;ons as ju&s;t and &s;atisfactory.

<P>In the Month of <HI>December,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bla|zing Star.</NOTE> that Blazing-&s;tar which appeared formidably to mo&s;t parts of the known World, was al&s;o &s;een within the Turki&s;h Empire, not without a general terrour of all, as progno&s;ticating di&s;a&s;ters of Sword, Pe&s;tilence, and Famine; and &s;et the Turki&s;h A&s;trologers at work to find out the my&s;tery it portended: from who&s;e Art mo&s;t commonly was divined the death of &s;ome great Per&s;on in the Empire, which &s;ome would have to be the Grand Signior, othes the Vi&s;ier; others both, as they de&s;ired alteration and change of Government.</P>
<P>The Grand Signior continued all this time at <HI>Adrianople,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sul|tans ha|tred to <HI>Con&s;tan|tinople</HI> in|crea&s;es.</NOTE> taken up with an extraordinary de|light and plea&s;ure in his Court there, with which his aver&s;ion to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> &s;o much increa&s;ed, that he could not endure &s;o much as the name of the place: and if accidentally in his Hunting (as it reported) he chanced to fall into the road which led thither, and remembring him&s;elf there|of, would immediately turn thence, as one that corrects him&s;elf of &s;ome de&s;perate errour, or a|voids a path which tends to an evitable de&s;tructi|on. The Kadele&s;cher and the other grave Judges of the Law ob&s;erving this unrea&s;onable hatred of their Prince to his Imperial Seat, con&s;idered how prejudicial it was to him and his People to have a City of that renown, antiquity, and commo|diou&s;ne&s;s of living, de&s;pi&s;ed and abandoned: and that perhaps the Souldiery now upon their March from the War, might be impatient of returning home, as all the Dependants on the <HI>Divan,</HI> and Per&s;onages of great Quality, de&s;ired to in|joy their Habitations and Gardens at <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople;</HI> from which di&s;contents on all &s;ides it was concluded, That there might re&s;ult dangerous Seditions and Mutinies, and therefore re&s;olved (and as &s;ome &s;ay al&s;o at the in&s;tigation of the Vi|zier) to pro&s;trate them&s;elves before the Grand Signior, and tender him their opinions and &s;ence in that particular, which they accordingly per|forming and a&s;&s;igning the Kadele&s;cher, or the Chief Ju&s;tice with all humility to be their Mouth in this Petition, their coun&s;el was received with that indignation, that they were cha&s;ed from the Grand Signiors pre&s;ence with fury and high di&s;|plea&s;ure, and the Kadele&s;cher at that moment deprived of his Office.</P>
<P>To the&s;e other extravagances the Grand Sig|nior would have added another of a higher na|ture and cruelty, by cau&s;ele&s;ly putting to death his Brother <HI>Solyman,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sul|tan &s;eeks to de&s;troy his Bro|ther.</NOTE> whom all the time of his Reign, together with another Brother, he had kept Pri&s;oner in the Seraglio: for now having a Son of his own, he conceived it more &s;ecure to remove all competition that might be for the Go|vernment, according to the example and cu&s;tom of the Ottoman Princes; but &s;uffering &s;ome re|mor&s;e of con&s;cience in the thoughts of imbruing his hands in the blood of his guiltle&s;s Brother, con|ceived it more ju&s;tifiable to perform the Fact by proce&s;s of Law, and to that end &s;ent to the Muf|ti for his Fetfa or Sentence, <HI>viz.</HI> That in &s;uch a ca&s;e, where there is a &s;ufficient provi&s;ion for con|tinuance of the true Lineage of the Ottoman Fa|mily, whether it may be lawful, according to their Law and ancient Pre&s;idents, to take off &s;ome as &s;uperfluous Suckers, that draw not only nouri&s;hment from the root, but endanger al&s;o the life of the Tree. But the Mufti was not &s;o cruel or unju&s;t as to pa&s;s this Sentence, but rather &s;up|plicated the Grand Signior to de&s;er this re&s;olu|tion; for having but one Son, and that a Child, which was &s;ubject to the common chances of mor|tality, the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Family was not &s;o &s;ufficient|ly provided of Heirs, that he could pa&s;s his Sen|tence for taking away one, who was &s;o nece&s;|&s;ary a re&s;erve and member of it; with which re|ply the Grand Signior &s;uffered him&s;elf to be overcome, having &s;ome touches of Con&s;cience, and perhaps, not being naturally cruel, &s;ome &s;ence of compa&s;&s;ion towards his innocent Bro|ther.</P>
<P>But returning now to the Great Vizier, we find him in his Winter quarters at <HI>Belgrade,</HI> where having taken an affection to the elder Son of the Tartar <HI>Chan,</HI> or el&s;e having conceived &s;ome ha|tred or di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t the Father,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Vizi|er offers to depo&s;e the Tartar <HI>Chan.</HI></NOTE> frankly proffered to depo&s;e the Father, and confer the Government upon him who was the Son. But it &s;eems this young <HI>Tartar,</HI> though barbarous, had yet &s;o much of filial obedience and reverence in&s;tamped on him by nature, that he mode&s;tly refu&s;ed the proffer, and immediatly di&s;patched a Me&s;&s;enger with &s;ecret Advices to his Father. The Tartar <HI>Chan</HI> received this Intelligence with great indignation, and purpo&s;ing to play that game in reallity with the Vizier, which he had pa&s;&s;ed on him only by way of overture, wrote a Letter to the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Buda,</HI> a man of great abilities and cou|rage, adverti&s;ing him, that hearing a true and worthy character of his prowe&s;s and wi&s;dom, he could not but de&s;ire to be his friend; and that he might make demon&s;trations of his being &s;uch, he proffered all the intere&s;t he had at the Ottoman Court to promote him to the &s;upreme Office of fir&s;t Vizier. What Fate &s;oever accompanied this mat|ter, either from the Confidents of the Tartars, or of the Pa&s;ha, the &s;ub&s;tance of the Me&s;&s;age came to the knowledge of the Vizier, who ob|taining a private Commi&s;&s;ion immediately from the Grand Signior therein, &s;ent for the Pa&s;ha, and without farther proce&s;s, or evidence of proof, or accu&s;ation, &s;truck off his Head.</P>

<P>The Spring being now well forward, the time of action, and the Summer at hand, the <HI>Turks</HI> remained with great expectation of the <HI>German</HI> Amba&s;&s;adour; and with greater impatience, in regard that their Amba&s;&s;adour had for &s;ome time continued upon the Frontiers. It was now <HI>May,</HI> and yet no news from <HI>Germany;</HI> &s;o that many be|gan to doubt the reality of the Peace, others re|flected on the di&s;honour of the Grand Signior, in having his Amba&s;&s;adour &s;o long on the Frontiers, as if the Peace had been precarious, and de&s;ired by the <HI>Turks:</HI> Some con&s;idered the pre&s;ent ill con&s;equences, in ca&s;e the War &s;hould break out again; for that licen&s;e was given to the greate&s;t part of the Army to return home, and all &s;uch as came as far as from <HI>Babylon, Dama&s;cus,</HI> and <HI>Egypt,</HI> to the Frontiers in <HI>Hungary</HI> were departed;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rumours of the People on occa&s;ion of &s;tay of the <HI>Ger|man</HI> Am|ba&s;&s;adour.</NOTE> and to recal the&s;e again, and other Zaims and Ti|mariots from remote parts, required a con&s;idera|ble time, of which their di&s;tre&s;s would not ad|mit, &s;hould the Chri&s;tians prove deceitful in their Treaty. Be&s;ides which, reports were &s;pread abroad, that the <HI>French</HI> had intercepted the Am|ba&s;&s;adour in his pa&s;&s;age about <HI>Komorra,</HI> and had given an interruption to the Peace. Others re|ported, that the Amba&s;&s;adour was dead in his Jour|ney, and that the <HI>Hungarians</HI> were again in Arms, as wholly di&s;&s;atisfied with the Peace. The&s;e ru|mours flying about, all People blamed the facili|ty of the Great Vizier in being too credulous and confident of the Faith and Morality of the Chri|&s;tians; and the Enemies of the Vizier more boldly adventured to accu&s;e his ill management of Affairs, which did not a little tickle the ambition of <HI>Mu|&s;tapha</HI> Pa&s;ha, then Captain Pa&s;ha, and Chimacam of <HI>Adrianople,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing that all the di&s;graces and ill &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the Vizier prepared a way for his a&s;cent unto that Office. And to become more popu|lar, being a man naturally of an affable and plau|&s;ible carriage, in&s;inuated him&s;elf into the favour and good opinion of the Great men and principal Favourites of the Seraglio, over-acting his part in &s;ome mea&s;ure by conde&s;cen&s;ions unbe&s;eeming the degree and dignity of a Chimacam,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> Pa&s;ha's affectati|on and populari|ty.</NOTE> being ob|&s;erved one day to ki&s;s the Ve&s;t of the Kuzlir-Aga, too apparent a piece of adulation and meanne&s;s in &s;o great a Subject, who in tho&s;e parts repre|&s;ents the Per&s;on of his Ma&s;ter. The&s;e pa&s;&s;ages were not altogether unknown to the Vizier; and though at a di&s;tance he could not perfectly view, and di&s;cover particularly the comportment of this Chimacam, yet being by conver&s;ation well ac|quainted with his &s;ubtle di&s;po&s;ition, gue&s;&s;ed at his thoughts, and the re&s;t of his actions, and to deal with him in the &s;ame terms, wrote a Letter to the Grand Signior, bewailing the ill &s;ucce&s;s of the War again&s;t <HI>Venice,</HI> and the ill e&s;tate and condition of the Fleet; to repair which, and to give courage to their men, and re&s;tore the Di&s;cipline in Marine Affairs, the pre&s;ence of the Captain-pa&s;ha was nece&s;&s;ary in the Fleet, who had now for Two years enjoyed the benefit and the title without per&s;onal attendance on that im|portant Charge. The Grand Signior having re|ceived this Letter, concurred in the &s;ame opi|nion with his Vizier, and gave Orders to the Chi|macam to prepare him&s;elf to &s;erve that Summer at Sea; for that now it was nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould be in Per&s;on there, and le&s;s requi&s;ite his pre&s;ence in the City, where his Office would &s;peedily be made void by return of the Vizier. The Chima|cam immediately in obedience to his great Ma|&s;ters command, put him&s;elf in a po&s;ture for his Voyage, and in the fir&s;t place &s;ent away his Wo|men to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and appointed the Fleet not to depart until his farther order: Yet in the mean time &s;o &s;ecretly and under-hand made u&s;e of the friend&s;hip of the Court-Favourites, repre&s;enting as from them&s;elves, how u&s;eful the &s;ervice and at|tendance of the Chimacam was as yet in the City, by rea&s;on that the delays of the <HI>German</HI> Amba&s;|&s;adour made the Viziers return uncertain, and that this Office would ill be &s;upplied by any another; they obtained licen&s;e for his continuance in Office, and di&s;appointed the intentions and de&s;igns of the Vizier.</P>
<P>About the end of <HI>May,</HI> after long expectation arrived the <HI>German</HI> Amba&s;&s;adour at <HI>Buda,</HI> to the great joy of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Camp. I then was there my &s;elf, and ob&s;erved the general &s;atisfaction at this news: &s;o that now the Amba&s;&s;adour being entred the Frontiers, and his arrival &s;ecured, on the Twenty ninth of <HI>May,</HI> the Vizier began his March from <HI>Belgrade</HI> with the whole Army, and I kept company with them for thirteen days. On the la&s;t of <HI>June</HI> the Vizier arrived within &s;ix hours Journey of <HI>Adrianople,</HI> intending in Two or Three days to prepare for his &s;olemn Entrance. But it is reported, That the Viziers Mother had by her Art &s;o affected the heart of the Grand Signior towards her Son, that he could not longer want his pre&s;ence, and therefore in the way di&s;patch|ed frequent Me&s;&s;ages to him to ha&s;ten him as fa&s;t as his convenience would permit. And bet|ter to a&s;&s;ure him of his grace and favour, &s;ent his young Favourite, a hand&s;om Youth of about Twenty years of age, to meet him with a Pre|&s;ent of five Hor&s;es richly adorned and furni&s;hed, and to fea&s;t him plentifully on the way: And be|ing come within a few hours Journey, the Grand Signior could not contain his de&s;ire of &s;ee|ing him, until the day of his Entry; but ordered him immediately to come to him, being im|patient of a private Conference. The Vizier ac|cordingly obeying, and being come to the Royal Pre&s;ence, the Grand Signior ki&s;&s;ed him on the &s;houlder, and honoured him with a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">It is in the fa&s;hi|on of a Mace, which the <HI>Turks</HI> wear at their Sad|dles.</NOTE> Topoo&s;e of Gold &s;tudded with precious Stones, with a Sword, a Dagger, and a Hor&s;e richly furni&s;hed, with which Regal Munificence he returned tri|umphing to his Tents, being now fully a&s;&s;ured of the real grace and con&s;tant favour of his Ma&s;ter. The &s;econd of <HI>July</HI> the Vizier made his Entrance with &s;olemn Pomp and Glory through part of the City, pa&s;&s;ing again into the Field to remain under Tents with the whole Camp, being &s;o or|dered by the Grand Signior, in regard the City was neither capable to contain &s;o great a num|ber without di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the greate&s;t part of the Inhabitants of their Hou&s;es, nor in this hot &s;ea&s;on of the Year was it &s;o whole&s;om and cool as the

Be&s;ides, matters would be in a far greater readine&s;s for a depar|ture towards <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> to which place the Vizier had per&s;waded the Grand Signior to make a Vi&s;it after Audience given to the <HI>German</HI> Am|ba&s;&s;adour, whom the People now expected with wonderful impatience.</P>
<P>Not many days after arrived Count <HI>Le&s;ly</HI> the Amba&s;&s;adour Extraordinary from his <HI>Cae&s;arean</HI> Maje&s;ty to the Grand Signior, who made a &s;olemn Entrance into the City, pa&s;&s;ing fir&s;t through the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Camp, where the Grand Signior remained, and thence to the Hou&s;e fur|ni&s;hed and appointed for him at the expence of the Sultan. The Cavalcade was as followeth: In the Front of all were the Ten Chaou&s;es which had attended the Amba&s;&s;adour through the whole Journey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Ger|man</HI> Am|ba&s;&s;adors Entrance.</NOTE> the&s;e were followed by an Hundred fifty five other Chaou&s;es with Muzevege, with &s;ome Captains over the Jani&s;aries&punc; The Am|ba&s;&s;adour had of his own Retinue about a Hun|dred and fifty Per&s;ons on Hor&s;e-back, well mounted, and cloathed after the <HI>Hungarian</HI> fa&s;hi|on; his proper Guard con&s;i&s;ted of Four and twenty Per&s;ons armed with Parti&s;ans; before him went his Trumpets, and Kettle Drums, but not &s;ound|ing, with Two Banners of &s;pread Eagles fly|ing, one of them richly embroidered, carried by a Count of the Empire. The Amba&s;&s;adour him|&s;elf was cloathed with a Cloth of Silver Ve&s;t, lined with Sables, on his Cap he wore a Feather after the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> fa&s;hion, adorned with Jewels, which they call <HI>(Sargouch)</HI> and is only u&s;ed by the Grand Signior, and his principal Vizier; before him went Eight led Hor&s;es richly furni&s;h|ed; immediately after him followed the Pages and Servants of the Spaheelar Aga&s;ee, and of the Aga which conducted him from the Frontiers. Next came his Litter covered with Violet colour|ed Velvet, and carried by Mules; then his three Coaches with &s;ix Hor&s;es a piece, one of which being richly gilded, and made chearful with Gla&s;s Windows after the new mode, the Grand Signior became much plea&s;ed with it, and at his reque&s;t it was pre&s;ented to him: after the&s;e fol|lowed four or five other Coaches of Four Hor&s;es, in which were Churchmen and unfirm per&s;ons; and la&s;t of all came the <HI>German</HI> Wagons, and other Carts with tho&s;e of the Countrey with Baggage.</P>

But becau&s;e in former days Amba&s;&s;adours from <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Genoua</HI> having like promi&s;es of admi&s;&s;ion, were notwith&s;tanding through the union of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Venetians,</HI> ob&s;tructed in their pa&s;&s;age, and forced to return home, though one of them as far as <HI>Scio</HI> in his way, and the other as <HI>Ragu&s;a;</HI> therefore this Marque&s;s in re|membrance hereof pre&s;&s;ed the Vizier farther in his promi&s;e, de&s;iring him to give him the a&s;&s;u|rance, that what oppo&s;ition might be made to the contrary by other Mini&s;ters, he would yet keep firm to that word he had given to his Re|publick: The Vizier con&s;tantly promi&s;ed that he would; and if any other Amba&s;&s;adours were not plea&s;ed with the friend&s;hip and Treaty of that day, they might &s;eek their remedy as they plea&s;ed, and if they plea&s;ed might have liberty to depart. The Marque&s;s being &s;atisfied with this a&s;&s;urance, took Letters to his Repub|lick in a&s;&s;urance thereof, and Articles were given, and Priviledges for Trade &s;igned according to the Tenour of other Capitulations: And be|ing herewith di&s;patched,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Ge|noe&s;e</HI> re|ceived.</NOTE> he returned home by Land, and the next year appeared again him&s;elf in the Per&s;on of Amba&s;&s;adour Extraordinary to the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Court; where after high and con|&s;iderable Pre&s;ents and great Expences made, chiefly &s;upported by the Hou&s;e of <HI>Durazzo,</HI> a Re&s;ident was &s;eated at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and a Con|&s;ul at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> where we will leave them for a while, and &s;ome years after (God willing) take an account of the profit and lo&s;s this progging Na|tion had made by this Emba&s;&s;y and Trade. But before we leave this point, it will be worth our noting, how hainou&s;ly the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;adour Mon&s;ieur <HI>La Haye</HI> took this entertainment of the <HI>Genoe&s;e,</HI> in regard he was &s;o concerned again&s;t his admi&s;&s;ion, that he declared to the chief Mi|ni&s;ters of State, how he had received Orders to oppo&s;e the entrance of the <HI>Genoe&s;e</HI> Nation, as highly prejudicial and ob&s;tructive to their Trade; and in &s;ine, to acquaint the Grand Signior, that in ca&s;e he re&s;olved to entertain them, his Ma&s;ter would withdraw his Amba&s;&s;adour and Nation; and therefore they ought to con&s;ider, whether a new Friend and an incon&s;iderable Republick ought to be perferred before the Known and ap|proved acquaintance of the powerful Empire of <HI>France.</HI> But what&s;oever the <HI>French</HI> Mini&s;ters were able to act to the contrary, the <HI>Genoe|&s;es</HI> kept their &s;tations, in which they were the better &s;ecured by tho&s;e frequent occa&s;ions of di&s;|gu&s;t his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty in defence of the Chri&s;tian Cau&s;e, had given to the&s;e Enemies of the Chri&s;tian Faith</P>
<P>The Great Vizier and the <HI>German</HI> Amba&s;&s;adour being now both at the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Port, the Wars were concluded, and every one began to di&s;po&s;e his affairs to a quiet and a repo&s;ed life. But this Empire being &s;till by God's Providence in a condition of growth and augmentation, could not remain long in Peace, nor long in health without exerci&s;e and action. Wherefore no &s;ooner was <HI>Germany</HI> at ea&s;e, than the Vi&s;ier be|gan to move the pro&s;ecution of the War in <HI>Can|dia,</HI> de&s;iring to obtain the glory of &s;ubjecting totally that I&s;land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> re&s;olve to pro&s;ecute the War in <HI>Candia.</HI></NOTE> which for the &s;pace of Twenty five years had been the principal &s;ubject of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> de&s;ign and exerci&s;e, and acquire to him|&s;elf the Fame in Hi&s;tory of being Conquerour of <HI>Candia,</HI> and Concluder of the <HI>Venetian</HI> War. Wherefore the Vizier with &s;everal other princi|pal Per&s;ons, a&s;&s;embled in a Garden near the City of <HI>Adrianople,</HI> &s;ent for the Signior <HI>Ballarino</HI> Repre&s;entative for the Republik of <HI>Venice;</HI> where being come, at the fir&s;t word demanded of him the Surrender of the whole I&s;land of <HI>Can|dia.</HI> To which he mode&s;tly replied, That &s;o great a gift was not in his power to give, and that his office was only to be a&s;&s;i&s;tant to that happy hour, wherein all matters might concur towards Peace, and that his Mediation might contribute towards a conclu&s;ion of this long and tedious War. In the mean time he &s;hould acquaint his Prince with the demand the Vizier was plea&s;ed to make. To which the <HI>Turks</HI> added menaces, with high and in&s;olent words, de&s;igning to bend their whole force and power again&s;t <HI>Candia,</HI> the effect of which will hereaf|ter be a material &s;ubject of our Hi&s;tory. And thus much, to my be&s;t remembrance, I received from the mouth of that <HI>Venetian</HI> Mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Grand Signior, though he continued his Sports and Hunting, without re|gard to the violent heats of the Summer; yet he began to entertain &s;omething more of warm af|fection towards his Women, and to be recon|ciled to that Sex, in contemplation of his little Son, who beginning now to play and prattle, afforded him matter of entertainment in the Apartments of his Women; &s;o that he affectionately doting on his Queen, gave order for increa&s;e of her Re|venue and Attendance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The G. Signior pa&s;&s;io|nately loves his Queen.</NOTE> and appointed the be&s;t Arti&s;ans of <HI>Adrianople</HI> to make her a Crown &s;tudded with very precious Stones to adorn her Head, of which he was &s;o impatient, that he or|dered the Gold&s;miths to work in the Seraglio, permitting them &s;carce time to eat or &s;leep until it was fini&s;hed. In recompence of which affecti|on of her Sultan, this Lady &s;o corre&s;ponded, that &s;he appeared pa&s;&s;ionately in love, practi&s;ing certain pretty tricks of &s;wooning and of an un|ea&s;ie condition in his ab&s;ence, which &s;o endear|ed him in all re&s;pects to her, that it was &s;aid the Sultan kept him&s;elf con&s;tant to this Queen only, and contrary to the cu&s;tom of other Emperors, and permi&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Laws, made u&s;e of the multitude of his other Women only for Slaves, or Attendants to the greater &s;tate and adoration of his beloved Queen.</P>
<P>And now the Grand Signior, at the per&s;wa&s;ion of the Vizier and others of his Council, re&s;olving to winter at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> certain Women of the lower rank were di&s;patched before, as fore|runners of the removal of the Court: And being in the Seraglio at large without ob&s;ervance and awe of their u&s;ual Spies, two of the bolde&s;t Wenches finding a Cradle, wherein the Royal Infants were u&s;ually laid, adventured to pick out the be&s;t Jewels, of which &s;ome were very good Stones, and afterwards laid it up again in a pri|vate place, where it was not ea&s;ily found. Not many days after the Queen-Mother wanting the Cradle of &s;o much value and antiquity, where many of the young Sultans had lain, &s;ent to the Seraglio at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> to fetch it thence. But it not being found, inqui&s;ition was made into all &s;ecret corners, the Wardrobes were &s;earched, but nothing appear'd, to the great fear of tho&s;e to who&s;e care it was committed, one accu&s;ing the other to
<PB N="166" REF="87">acquit him&s;elf. In fine, the matter was &s;o tra|ced, that &s;ome whi&s;pers there were concerning tho&s;e in who&s;e hands the Cradle not long be|fore was &s;een to remain. The Women having guilty con&s;ciences were amazed in being &s;o clo&s;e|ly followed, and fearing the matter &s;hould be per e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">tly di&s;covered, entred into con&s;ultation what cour&s;e they &s;hould take to &s;ave their lives and their honour. In fine, they both concluded, that in &s;uch an extremity de&s;perate remedies ought to be u&s;ed, than which none was better than to &s;et fire to the Seraglio,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Se|raglio at <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople</HI> &s;et on fire.</NOTE> by which means, either the thing &s;ought for, would be e&s;teemed for burnt and con&s;umed by the fire, or in &s;o great a lo&s;s it might be hoped that matters of &s;maller moment would not be remembred. Wherefore the bold Wenches without other con&s;ideration gave fire with their Candle to the roof of Cedar, of which wood mo&s;t of the Womens rooms in the Se|raglio are made, which in a moment made &s;uch a flame, as with the help of a little wind, was carried through all the quarters of the Womens Apartments, and thence took its way to the <HI>Di|van</HI> Chamber, and other con&s;iderable parts of the Court, where many Records and Regi&s;ters of Law were con&s;umed to a&s;hes, together with one of the le&s;&s;er Trea&s;uries, where much riche&s;s, which endured not the te&s;t of fire, peri&s;hed: And the whole Seraglio had run an evident hazard, had not the Bo&s;tangees and other Servants of the Court ventured far into the flames, in which many of them mi&s;erably peri&s;hed. The fire be|ing quenched, and the Women afterwards (I know not how) detected to have been the Au|thors thereof, were &s;ent to <HI>Adrianople,</HI> and being there accu&s;ed, were &s;trangled by the immediate order of the Grand Signior.</P>
<P>But the de&s;truction of that con&s;iderable part of the Seraglio was no impediment to the Grand Signiors return to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> being rebuilt with that &s;peed and indu&s;try, equal or excelling the magnificence of the former, that the day pre|fixed for the Journey thither was not prolonged by rea&s;on thereof. How&s;oever the Grand Sig|niors aver&s;ion to the place made the wheels of his Chariots move &s;low, and the quickne&s;s of his Attendants grew &s;lack and cold, ob&s;erving &s;o much di&s;plea&s;ure in their Emperor to the place de|&s;igned. For though he was pre&s;&s;ed by the Vizier to begin his Journey, and could not hand&s;omly refu&s;e to comply with the time appointed; yet to defer this re&s;olution as long as was po&s;&s;ible; he contriv'd a long way of Meander towards <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> for|ming his Journey in Company with the Great Vi|zier by way of the <HI>Dardanelli</HI> upon the <HI>Helle&s;pont,</HI> on pretence of viewing the Fortifications of the new Forts rai&s;ed at the entrance of that Streight, and &s;ending &s;ome Provi&s;ions from thence for Relief of <HI>Candia;</HI> wherefore the Captain-Pa&s;ha was commanded to Sea with three gallies, and at <HI>Gallipoli</HI> to attend the Grand Signiors arrival, be|ing to tran&s;port him thence to the Ca&s;tles, and back again. And the de&s;ign being now re&s;olved, and hot to pro&s;ecute the VVar in <HI>Candia;</HI> for tran|&s;porting thither a numerous Army, it was conclu|ded, That the Captain-Pa&s;ha &s;hould propo&s;e to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;adour the Grand Signiors de&s;ire of Fifteen Sail of Ships, with con&s;ent of our King, for this Service, the <HI>Turks</HI> paying what rea&s;onable Rates &s;hould be demanded. But the Earl of <HI>Win|chel&s;ea</HI> then Lord Amba&s;&s;adour, mode&s;tly replied, That though His Maje&s;ty of <HI>England</HI> did always entertain a good affection and a zealous di&s;po&s;ition towards the Affairs of the Grand Signior; yet at pre&s;ent the VVar with <HI>Holland,</HI> and ill un|der&s;tanding with <HI>France,</HI> made his occa&s;ions for his own Shipping more urgent than u&s;ual, and the time mo&s;t un&s;ea&s;onable to pre&s;s his Maje&s;ty in this particular: by which reply and &s;everal o|ther excu&s;es of the Amba&s;&s;adour, the Captain-Pa&s;ha perceiving an aver&s;ne&s;s to the Propo&s;ition, and that Chri&s;tians unwillingly arm <HI>Turks</HI> again&s;t the Cro&s;s, gave an account of this di&s;cour&s;e to the Grand Signior and Vizier, who immediate|ly gave order for the building of &s;ixty Gallies again&s;t the next Spring, which with what they had before would make up above an Hun|dred Sail. The Rendezvous of this Fleet, to|gether with Saykes and other <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;els,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> prepare for a War on <HI>Candia.</HI></NOTE> from thence to tran&s;port the Vizier and his Army for <HI>Candia,</HI> was appointed to be made at <HI>Malvoi|&s;ia</HI> of the &s;ucce&s;s of which we &s;hall have occa&s;ion (God willing) to di&s;cour&s;e in the following Year, which gave a beginning (as we may &s;ay) to the total lo&s;s of that Country, and to that fa|mous Siege, which in Hi&s;tory will bear the Fame of one of the mo&s;t memorable in the World. And as a preparation thereunto, and as a &s;upply of the pre&s;ent urgent nece&s;&s;ities, three Ships, <HI>viz.</HI> one <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> another <HI>French,</HI> and a third <HI>Dutch</HI> were laden with Corn, and thirty Sail of Beys Gallies, with all &s;orts of Arms and Ammunition, with a Recruit of a thou&s;and Jani&s;aries, were di|&s;peeded from <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> for Reinforcement and Succour of that I&s;land.</P>
<P>And now at length the Grand Signior after his long circuit arrived at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> where he made his &s;olemn Entry the Third of <HI>October,</HI> but not with that Joy and Pomp, which u&s;ually at|tended other Sultans in their return from the Wars and labours to their Imperial City; but all things &s;eemed like the Sultans humour, &s;ullen and di&s;plea&s;ed; for he &s;eldom lodged in his Seraglio, or &s;lept there, but at a &s;mall Palace called <HI>Daout-Pa&s;ha,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The G. Signior arrives at <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI></NOTE> where he for the mo&s;t part made his abode; only &s;ometimes in the day he pa&s;&s;ed a few hours at his Seraglio, but re&s;ted not there in the Night: The rea&s;ons hereof &s;ome attributed to the remembrance of tho&s;e dangers and troubles which he had &s;een in that Court, and which made &s;o deep an impre&s;&s;ion on his fancy, that he could never enter within tho&s;e Gates with|out &s;ome &s;en&s;e of terrour for the late di&s;or|ders.</P>
<P>The <HI>German</HI> War being thus concluded, the Sultan returned to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and Affairs di&s;|po&s;ing them&s;elves to &s;pend their fury again&s;t <HI>Candia,</HI> all things growing black and tempe&s;tu|ous towards that Coa&s;t, the <HI>Venetians</HI> prudently provided to oppo&s;e the &s;torm. And as an able General,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marque&s;s <HI>Villa</HI> re|ceived in|to &s;ervice of the <HI>Venetians.</HI></NOTE> and wi&s;e and experienced Captains are the &s;upports of an Army; and that the &s;ucce&s;s of War depends much on Martial Di&s;cipline, and on the vigilance and wi&s;dom of the Comman|ders, the Senate gave order to their Amba&s;&s;adour at <HI>Turen,</HI> called <HI>Catarin Belegno,</HI> to offer unto Mar|que&s;s <HI>Ghiron France&s;co Villa,</HI> a Native of that Country, the honourable charge of General of the Foot, with a &s;tipend of 12000 Crowns of yearly Pay; the &s;aid Marque&s;s obliging him&s;elf to bring with him Four Captains, and two Lieu|tenant-Generals, for entertainment of whom the Republick allowed Five thou&s;and Ducats, be|&s;ides Seventy Ducats a Month pay to an Engi|neer. To this Marque&s;s <HI>Villa</HI> a power was given to command in chief over all, without &s;ubjection to any other than to the Captain-General, and to the Proveditor General in <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> when he waged War in that Province: And in &s;hort, his actions were not to be que&s;tioned or examin|ed by any other than the Senate it &s;elf, to whom he was immediately &s;ubjected, and a Gally was
<PB N="167" REF="87">to be allotted purpo&s;ely to tran&s;port him and his Family to <HI>Candia.</HI> Upon the&s;e conditions agreed at <HI>Turen,</HI> Marque&s;s <HI>Villa</HI> took his Journey to <HI>Venice</HI> about the beginning of <HI>April,</HI> being ac|companied with his Kin&s;man <HI>France&s;co Villa,</HI> his Nephew <HI>Benedetto</HI> Count of <HI>Lagna&s;co,</HI> Count <HI>Lodovico Saluzza,</HI> and Count <HI>Bernardino Barret|ta,</HI> which Four &s;erved in quality of Captains, together with <HI>Gio.

With the&s;e Companions and &s;everal other Vo|luntiers, Gentlemen of Quality, the Mar|que&s;s <HI>Villa</HI> was received with much honour by the Nobility and People of <HI>Venice;</HI> and being introduced into the Colledge, with a &s;ingular grace and fluency of Language he began to &s;peak in this manner.</P>
<FLOATEXT LANG="eng" TYPE="speech">
<P>IF thanks, mo&s;t Serene Prince, and mo&s;t Excellent Sirs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Speech of Marquis <HI>Villa</HI> to the Senate.</NOTE> ought to be equivalent to the benefits we receive, I mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity (not to appear ungrateful) refu&s;e tho&s;e fa|vours, which this mo&s;t Serene Republick is plea&s;ed to confer upon me; or re&s;olve to ap|pear ungrateful, becau&s;e I am unable to make a compen&s;ation. But I &s;atisfie my &s;elf in this, That as the mind which re|ceives favours, and returns thanks is the &s;ame; &s;o that mind which makes acknow|ledgments with a due &s;en&s;e of them, doth in &s;ome mea&s;ure equal the benefit, though it prove defective in expre&s;&s;ions to declare it. I do therefore confe&s;s and acknowledge, that the Election you have been plea&s;ed to make of me among&s;t &s;o many con&s;picuous Per&s;ons, unto a Charge graced by mo&s;t re|nowned Predece&s;&s;ours, and in it &s;elf mo&s;t honourable, is a mo&s;t &s;ingular favour, and an effect of your immen&s;e Bounty to me; which though it be limited with &s;ome &s;ubordination, yet it may &s;erve for the ul|timate Goal to a glorious Cour&s;e of Mili|tary labours. I mu&s;t al&s;o farther acknow|ledge, That as it is the property of this mo&s;t Serene Republick to receive momentary Services, and to render them Eternal by Records in Hi&s;tory; &s;o they have been plea&s;ed to adjoyn unto my mean de&s;erts a remembrance of the humble devotion which my Ance&s;tors profe&s;&s;ed towards them: I mean <HI>Alfon&s;o Villa</HI> my great Grand-father, who in that mo&s;t glorious Fleet at <HI>Lepanto,</HI> who&s;e Sails were the wings of Victory, evi|denced his Chri&s;tian Zeal again&s;t that Peo|ple, which i&s;&s;uing from the bowels of Sea-mon&s;ters, continue to vent their ancient rage again&s;t your mo&s;t Serene Highne&s;s. Nor with le&s;s promptne&s;s of mind, had my Grandfather <HI>France&s;co Villa,</HI> and my Fa|ther <HI>Guido Villa,</HI> con&s;ecrated their Powers to your Command: but that the unparal|lel'd Equity of this most Serene Republick gave permi&s;&s;ion, that one of them &s;hould take the charge of General of the Artillery of the Holy Church under the Pope his Su|pream Lord, preferring a natural duty be|fore a voluntary &s;ervice; and that the other being entertained in &s;ervice of the mo&s;t In|vincible <HI>Charles Emanuel</HI> in <HI>Piedmont,</HI> you were plea&s;ed to judge, That the &s;ervice done to a Prince your Confederate, and Son of this Republick, was a &s;ervice and duty rendred to your &s;elves: &s;o that this Election made of me by this mo&s;t Serene Republick, and approved by the &s;ingular goodne&s;s of that <HI>Charles Emanuel,</HI> who now reigns, eviden|ces the De&s;tiny of my Family, and obliges me to &s;atis&s;ie that hereditary debt by per|formances, which my Ance&s;tors entertained only in their wi&s;hes. Hence it is, that to this my Election &s;ome cele&s;tial influence hath concurred, by which I am clearly a&s;|&s;ured, that your more than humane Power is de&s;irous to imitate the Divine, which oftentimes makes u&s;e of weak means to ope|rate miraculous effects, that to you only the &s;ucce&s;s may be acknowledged, and to you only the thanks be returned: That if the Providence of your Serenity, and of this mo&s;t Serene Republick will be plea&s;ed (as I am a&s;&s;ured you will) to imitate the Divine Pro|vidence, which co-operates with means, the number and quality of your Troops and plen|ty of your Provi&s;ions, which are the Nerves of War, are tho&s;e means which corre&s;pond with the ends you de&s;ign: And therefore I dare pre&s;age, that I &s;hall not only &s;ee the threat|ning horns of the changeable <HI>Ottoman</HI> Planet precipitated into the Sea by the <HI>Venetian</HI> horn of &s;trength; but tho&s;e glorious Conque&s;ts re|newed, which rendered your Name more bright and re&s;plendent than the Sun it &s;elf in his Oriental parts. With the&s;e au&s;picious Pre&s;ages, I &s;eel already in my brea&s;t an impatient heat to &s;acrifice my life in &s;o worthy a Cau&s;e, fancying that I &s;erve the &V;niver&s;e, whil&s;t I am engaged in the &s;ervice of the greate&s;t of Republicks, which communicates delicious Fruit to all People, gathered from tho&s;e triumphant Palms, which were planted and watered with her own &s;weat and labours; and re&s;embles her own generous Lion, which continually &s;tands on the Guard in oppo&s;ition to the common Ene|my, that all other People may rest quiet, and repo&s;e &s;ecure. And thus much, Mo&s;t Serene Prince, and Mo&s;t Excellent Sirs, &s;hall &s;uffice to have been &s;poken by a Soldier, not acquainted with Eloquence, to whom Courage is more requi&s;ite than Words, and to fight well with the hand, is more laudable than to utter florid Speeches with the Tongue.</P>

<P>According to the preceding coun&s;el and de|&s;ire of Marqui&s;s <HI>Villa,</HI> the Senate &s;ent by divers Convoys great plenty of Provi&s;ion and Ammuni|tion to <HI>Candia,</HI> and fitted their Fleet with all things nece&s;&s;ary; and &s;trengthened their Forts both with Hor&s;e and Foot drawn out of their Gari&s;ons on the <HI>Terra Firma,</HI> being a&s;&s;i&s;ted with Men and Money from other Princes and States.

<P>In this manner the prudent Care of the Veneti|ans provided for their own &s;afety: But at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> things were more quiet, for it being Winter, the Turks made Entertainments for the German Amba&s;&s;adour, who was fir&s;t &s;ea&s;ted by the Chimacham, and twice afterwards, with much Magnificence, by the Great Vizier at his own Garden, &s;eated on the <HI>Bo&s;phorus,</HI> all difficulties being before overcome, and agreed, unle&s;s the deliverance of the poor Captives from the Pri&s;on and the Oar, who continued in the torment of expectation between hope and fear, either of liberty or perpetual &s;lavery. Which Treaty though it properly belonged to the Vizier, to whom the ab&s;olute power is derived, yet in formality it was re&s;erved for matter of the la&s;t Au|dience with the Grand Signior, who being de&s;irous to attend his Hunting and Pa&s;time abroad, was in pain, until he had complyed with his Of|fice towards this Amba&s;&s;adour, who&s;e departure though not &s;ome time after de&s;igned, yet be|ing often called upon to receive his Di&s;patch from the Grand Signior, was admitted on the 31th of <HI>October</HI> to his Audience with the &s;ame formali|ty and fea&s;ting as is common to all other Amba&s;&s;adours in the Divan, or place of Judi|cature, and received three and forty Coftans be|&s;towed on him&s;elf and his retinue, and thence be|ing conducted to the Chamber of Audience, with &s;ome of the principal Noblemen of his Company, they pre&s;ented them&s;elves on their Knees, with their Faces on the Ground, accor|ding to the Cu&s;tom of the Ea&s;tern Courts; with which occa&s;ion the Heer <HI>Reningen,</HI> who had for &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen years been Re&s;ident for the Emperor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ger|man Am|ba&s;&s;adors la&s;t Audi|ence with the Grand Signior</NOTE> a per&s;on grown infirm with Age and the Gout, and his Knees not &s;o active and pliable as the younger &s;ort, coming al&s;o to take his turn in this pro&s;trate manner of Wor&s;hip, was &s;o rudely handled by the kapugiba&s;hees, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted on each Arm at the Ceremony, that he not being able to bow his head &s;o ea&s;ily as others, was thru&s;t down by them with &s;o little con&s;ideration or re&s;pect, that his Brows and Forehead were broken on the Flour; which mi&s;chance &s;o di&s;ordered him, as put him be&s;ides that Speech which he had premediated in Turk|i&s;h to addre&s;s to the Grand Signior; and though he curbed what was po&s;&s;ible his pa&s;&s;ion, whil&s;t he remained in the Royal Pre&s;ence, yet in vain after|wards he vented his Choler with words again&s;t tho&s;e unmannerly Officers without other re|medy or &s;atisfaction. The Demands of the Amba&s;&s;adour were in writing read before the Grand Signior, according to the cu&s;tom of the Court, and principally concerned the freedom of the Slaves, &s;ome of which were then in the Gallies, and Banniard, and others of the mo&s;t principal in the &s;even Towers. Other Demands there were in relation to the State of <HI>Tran&s;ylvania,</HI> that for the future it might be free from Incur&s;ions, in which particular the Turks had already vi|olated the Peace; and that a more orderly Government of Affairs might be ob&s;erved on the Frontiers, than u&s;ually had pa&s;&s;ed, as agreed by the la&s;t Capitulations. To which the Grand Signior gave no An&s;wer, referring all to the Vizi|er, only told the Amba&s;&s;adour in &s;hort, That he &s;hould coun&s;el his Ma&s;ter to beware of inva|ding the Ottoman Dominions, or acting any thing in prejudice of the Peace.</P>
<P>The Articles of Peace made between the Two Emperors were for the mo&s;t part a confirmation of the ancient Agreement, only it was provided as a new Addition. That the Armies &s;hould de|part from the Confines of <HI>Tran&s;ilvania.</HI> Second|ly, That the Ca&s;tles and Forts gari&s;oned with <HI>German</HI> Soldiers in that Countrey &s;hould be re&s;igned into the hands of the Prince. And Thirdly, There were other particulars added in reference to <HI>Newhau&s;el,</HI> and the Countries ad|jacent lately conquered, and the Limits of both Emperors, as before declared.</P>
<P>But whil&s;t the&s;e things were in agitation, and Amba&s;&s;adours interchangeably at either Court, the <HI>Turks</HI> of <HI>Varadin</HI> and <HI>Janoua</HI> made fre|quent incur&s;ions into <HI>Tran&s;ilvania,</HI> de&s;troying the Villages, and carrying away great numbers of Captives; and &s;o lately, as about the begin|ning of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> la&s;t, tho&s;e of <HI>Varadin</HI> conveyed them&s;elves privately under the Ca&s;tle <HI>C&s;eh,</HI> and robbed the Hor&s;es belonging to that Gari&s;on, killed &s;ome, and carried others into &s;lavery; at which time al&s;o Two thou&s;and <HI>Turks</HI> be&s;ieged the Ca&s;tle <HI>Valko,</HI> which they took, and razed to the ground; which Complaints of their Coun|tries Aggrievances the <HI>Tran&s;ilvanians</HI> intimated to the <HI>German</HI> Amba&s;&s;adour, as matters al|ready acted contrary to the late Articles of Peace, reque&s;ting farther to interpo&s;e for a modera|tion and abatement of their Tribute, which <HI>Kuperlee</HI> had, contrary to Oath and rea&s;on, un|ju&s;tly augmented. But the Amba&s;&s;adour &s;eemed &s;o coldly to interpo&s;e in this behalf, as taught the <HI>Turks</HI> to deny his Reque&s;ts, acquie&s;cing with this An&s;wer, That it was no breach of Peace then to make incur&s;ions on the Frontiers, as al&s;o without Cannon to rob, and &s;poil, and skir|mi&s;h, not exceeding Five thou&s;and men in num|ber. For it appeared that the Amb&s;&s;adour was mo&s;t de&s;irous to &s;ecure the main points of the Peace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Rea|&s;ons why the <HI>German</HI> Amba&s;&s;a|dour in|terpo&s;ed not in be|half of <HI>Tran&s;yl|vania.</HI></NOTE> which concerned mo&s;t the Intere&s;t of the Empire, and not hazard it for &s;uch like Concernments of <HI>Tran&s;ilvania;</HI> for though it &s;eemed &s;trange to the World to &s;ee a Peace ha&s;tily clapt up with di&s;advantageous Terms on the Emperors &s;ide, whil&s;t he was victorious and fortunate in &s;everal Enterprizes; yet they that penetrated farther into the State and Condi|tion of the Empire, report, That there was a nece&s;&s;ity of making a moderate u&s;e of the&s;e &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es by a fair accommodation, rather than to tempt Providence by a too eager and continued pro&s;ecution of the War. For it was ob&s;erved that the De&s;igns of making the Duke of <HI>Anguien,</HI> Son to the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> King of <HI>Poland,</HI> pro|ceeded forward; and that there was a Combi|nation of a dangerous League among&s;t the Princes of the <HI>Rhine.</HI> The Divi&s;ions between the <HI>Ger|mans</HI> and the <HI>Hungarians</HI> encrea&s;ed; the latter of which are known to be an ob&s;tinate &s;ort of People. The Army al&s;o of the <HI>French</HI> was fear|ed in the Bowels of the Empire, under the Com|mand of Mon&s;ieur <HI>la Feuvillade,</HI> who under pretence of applying them&s;elves to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Chri&s;tendom, were &s;u&s;pected to come with in|tentions to advance the intere&s;t of their King, and force the next Diet to elect him King of the <HI>Romans;</HI> in order whereunto, and in con&s;idera|tion of farther a&s;&s;i&s;tance, they demanded &s;e|veral Towns in <HI>Hungary</HI> to be delivered into their hands, and made extravagant Propo&s;iti|ons for Winter Quarters; all which con&s;idered, made the <HI>German</HI> Amba&s;&s;adour more ten|der how he entred into Di&s;putes with the <HI>Turk,</HI> which might prejudice the e&s;&s;ential points of the Peace, or occa&s;ion a new War more de&s;tructive to <HI>Germany</HI> through the

<P>On the <HI>21th</HI> of the Month of <HI>November</HI> arrived ar <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> Mon&s;ieur <HI>De Ventelay,</HI> Amba&s;&s;a|dour from the <HI>French</HI> King to the Grand Signior,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Am|ba&s;&s;adour arrives from <HI>France.</HI></NOTE> who was Son to the Sieur <HI>De la Haye,</HI> the for|mer Amba&s;&s;adour, a Per&s;on much talked of be|fore he arrived; a generous and an accompli&s;h|ed Gentleman, and one well practi&s;ed in the Af|fairs of that Countrey. To under&s;tand which &s;tory the better we mu&s;t look back to the former Year, at the beginning of which during the <HI>Ger|man</HI> War, and that the Vizier remained in his Winter-quarters at <HI>Belgrade,</HI> a Courier with Let|ters from his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty to the Fir&s;t Vizier arrived, who concealed not the occa&s;ion of his coming, nor the contents of his Letters with that &s;ecrecy, but that tho&s;e who were im|ployed in the Tran&s;lation of the Papers into <HI>Turki&s;h,</HI> made it publickly known to be no other than a recital of the many provocations his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty had received from the Pirates of <HI>Barbary,</HI> containing a Li&s;t of the Ships, Men, and Goods they had from time to time &s;eized and made Prize: in vindication of which indignities to his Honour, and in protection of his People, he could not do le&s;s than make a War upon tho&s;e Pirates (for as yet the advice was not come, that the <HI>French</HI> had de&s;erted <HI>Gi|geri</HI>) in which for the foregoing rea&s;ons the Grand Signior ought not to judge him&s;elf con|cerned. And for the Succour given the Empe|ror, it was not afforded as King of <HI>France,</HI> but as one of the Princes of the Empire, in which capacity, by virtue of his Tenure, he was obli|ged to contribute &s;uch Forces on the like emer|gencies and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the Empire. And if the foregoing rea&s;ons were available with the Sultan to induce him (as in rea&s;on he ought) to believe he continued in perfect friend&s;hip with him, with|out breach of Articles, he was then ready to &s;end his Amba&s;&s;adour to re&s;ide at the Port, pro|vided it might be Mon&s;ieur <HI>De Ventelay,</HI> Son to Mon&s;ieur <HI>De la Haye</HI> late Amba&s;&s;adour there, who was the Per&s;on that had &s;ome time &s;ince re|ceived indignities from the Vizier <HI>Kuperlee,</HI> that &s;o his Maje&s;ty might receive &s;atisfaction, by ha|ving the very Per&s;on of Mon&s;ieur <HI>De Ventelay,</HI> ho|noured by extraordinary demon&s;trations of re|&s;pect, in reparation of the former affronts. This Me&s;&s;enger having tran&s;lated his Papers, ob|tained licen&s;e to ride Po&s;t to the Vizier, and in the fro&s;ts and extremities of the weather in <HI>January</HI> &s;et forward on his Journey; but in his pa&s;&s;age through <HI>Adrianople,</HI> vi&s;iting the Chimacam, and de&s;iring his licen&s;e in like manner to ride Po&s;t to the Vizier on publick affairs, received &s;uch a le&s;&s;on of &s;corn and di&s;dain, vented with the ex|tremity of choler again&s;t the <HI>French</HI> Nation in publick Divan, with terms undecent to be re|peated: And that in farther re&s;entment, if he were Fir&s;t Vizier, he would refu&s;e to accept any friend&s;hip or alliance with them; but &s;ince he was inferiour to the Great Vizier, he would di&s;peed him to the Camp, and grant him a Command for his Po&s;t. But it &s;eems this Courier being ar|rived at <HI>Belgrade,</HI> was received with better terms, and more courte&s;ie by the Vizier, who had learned by experience of the late Chri&s;tian Wars, and proof of the Valour of the <HI>French</HI> Nation, that the Propo&s;itions of that King were not lightly to be contemned. And therefore con|&s;ented that Mon&s;ieur <HI>De Ventelay</HI> might freely come (u&s;ing their common expre&s;&s;ion) that the Arms of the Port are always open to re|ceive the addre&s;&s;es of Friends, Allies, and Con|federates. With this Me&s;&s;age and Letters the Courier was di&s;patched by way of <HI>Rag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;i</HI> with &s;afe conduct, and what el&s;e was requi&s;ite for his &s;ecurer pa&s;&s;age. No doubt but his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty was the more urgent, that the Per&s;on of Mon&s;ieur <HI>De Ventelay</HI> (who was the &s;ubject on whom formerly the <HI>Turks</HI> had exerci&s;ed &s;uch injurious violence) &s;hould be accepted for Am|ba&s;&s;adour, and re&s;olved,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflexions of the Turks on the Em|ba&s;&s;y of Mon&s;ieur <HI>De Vente|lay</HI></NOTE> unle&s;s they received him, he would &s;end no other, that &s;o his Honour which &s;uffered before in this Per&s;on, might be repaired again by the re&s;pect and reverence they were to &s;hew to him as Amba&s;&s;adour, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> in repentance of their former unkindne&s;s, they &s;hould now &s;trive to make amends by extraordinary de|mon&s;trations of honour to this Repre&s;entative.

<PB N="170" REF="89">his better Equipage was attended by four or five Marque&s;&s;es and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">er&s;ons of Quality. Being ar|rived at the farther part of the City called the Se|ven Towers, the Ships came to an Anchor, from whence the Amba&s;&s;adour &s;ent to advi&s;e the Vi|zier of his arrival, de&s;iring as one mark of the extraordinary honour promi&s;ed him, that a re|turn might be made to the Salute of his Ship from the Seraglio, by the Cannon which lay under the Wall, a Ceremony before never demanded, or practi&s;ed with re&s;pect to any Chri&s;tian or Turk|i&s;h Ve&s;&s;el; and that his landing might be ho|noured with a more than u&s;ual reception by the attendance of Officers, or at lea&s;t equalled to the Formalities of the late Engli&s;h Amba&s;&s;adour. But the Vizier it &s;eems judged, that the recepti|on of the Engli&s;h, &s;trained on a particular occa|&s;ion, was not to be brought into example, and that a Salute from the Seraglio was &s;o be&s;ides the ordinary cu&s;tom, that he e&s;teemed the demand to be extravagant, and that &s;uch a Pre&s;i|dent would be di&s;honourable to his Ma&s;ter. And therefore re&s;olving not to exceed the perticulars of former cu&s;toms, offered at his landing to have him accompanied to his Hou&s;e with ten Chaou&s;es, only the Amba&s;&s;adour not accepting hereof, in a di&s;contented manner entred with his Ship the day following, and giving the u&s;ual Salutes to the Seraglio, landed at <HI>Topenau,</HI> a place near to his own Dwelling, from whence with no other attendance than his own Company, privately walked up, and with no farther ceremony took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the place of Re&s;idence of former Am|ba&s;&s;adours from <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this &s;light treatment, the Am|ba&s;&s;adour was not &s;o much mortified, but he con|ceived hopes, that the Turks would at length in contemplation of his Ma&s;ters greatne&s;s, gratifie him with &s;ome &s;ignal demon&s;trations of extraor|dinary honour, by conce&s;&s;ions of unu&s;ual Pri|viledges, and greater facility in his Negotiations: and therefore was induced, though as yet he had not had a per&s;onal Audience of the Vizier, to de&s;ire a revocation of the Agreement made with the Genoe&s;e, (the Marque&s;s <HI>Durazzo,</HI> of whom we have &s;poken before, being ju&s;t upon his departure) prote&s;ting again&s;t it with all ear|ne&s;tne&s;s, as a matter &s;o prejudicial to the French Traffick and Commerce in tho&s;e Dominions, that if admi&s;&s;ion were given to the Genoe&s;e, they mu&s;t expect to lo&s;e friend&s;hip and commerce with <HI>France.</HI> But notwith&s;tanding this heat and other prote&s;tations again&s;t it, the Vizier who in|herited his Fathers &s;pirit, little regarded the di&s;content of the French, but calmly an&s;wered, That the Grand Signior was Ma&s;ter of him&s;elf and Country, and might make Peace or War at his own plea&s;ure without licence or permi&s;&s;ion of the French king; and that &s;uch as were envious, or di&s;contented at the Peace, had free liberty to depart and take their remedy as they e&s;teemed mo&s;t beneficial.</P>
<P>In this manner matters pa&s;&s;ed between the time of this Amba&s;&s;adours Arrival and his Au|dience.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A &s;trange accident befallen the French Captain of the Man of War.</NOTE> In which interim the curio&s;ity of Mon|&s;ieur <HI>Abermont,</HI> Captain of the French Man of War, had like to have proved fatal to him; for whil&s;t he viewed from the Gallery of his Ship the plea&s;ant &s;ituation of the Seraglio, and the Pro&s;pect of the <HI>Bo&s;phorus,</HI> behold at a di&s;tance appeared certain Gallies gently gliding down the &s;tream, dre&s;&s;ed up with Flags and Streamers, which all Ships and Saykes &s;aluted with their Guns as they pa&s;&s;ed. This Captain being informed that the Grand Signior was there in per&s;on, and returned from his Hunting, which he had made in certain Woods not far from the City, &s;aluted him al&s;o as he pa&s;&s;ed with twenty five Guns; but being not able to di&s;cover his per&s;on, pre&s;ently fitted his Boat and followed him, hoping to receive that &s;atisfaction at his landing; fot conceiving, that acce&s;s to the Ottoman and Ea&s;tern Princes is as facile and grateful, as it is to tho&s;e of Chri&s;tendom, with all confidence endeavoured to acco&s;t the Per&s;on of the Grand Signior as near as was po&s;&s;ible. The Grand Signi|or turning his eyes, and &s;eeing a man habited (as he conceived) in a barbarous and extravagant dre&s;s, apprehended the Maje&s;ty of his Per&s;on vio|lated by &s;o near and bold an approach of the cu|rious Stranger; and thereupon, without farther inquiry, being moved with &s;corn and indignati|on, called for the Executioner, who is ever rea|dy at his hand; but &s;ome per&s;ons then pre&s;ent, e&s;pecially the Bo&s;tangiba&s;hee, being of more mo|deration, be&s;eeched the Grand Signior to have a little patience, and to enquire of the Ghaur or Infidel (as they call'd him) the cau&s;e of this his boldne&s;s: with which the Grand Signior &s;uppre&s;|&s;ing a little his pa&s;&s;ion, and having patience until one was &s;ent to expo&s;tulate with the Captain, who all this while, though he perceived &s;ome di&s;turbance, was yet ignorant that the matter &s;o dangerou&s;ly concerned him&s;elf; and not being able to under&s;tand the Me&s;&s;enger, nor to be un|der&s;tood by him, rendred the bu&s;ine&s;s more confu|&s;ed, and le&s;s under&s;tood: which the Me&s;&s;enger ob&s;erving, and knowing the danger of this wor|thy and innocent Gentleman, being perhaps of a compa&s;&s;ionate nature, and prudent, framed this excu&s;e to the Grand Signior, That he did not well under&s;tand the Infidels language, but what he conjectured was, That he being Captain of that Ve&s;&s;el, which had newly &s;aluted his Maje&s;ty as he pa&s;&s;ed with twenty five Guns, was now come in confidence of his Royal bounty and cle|mency to receive a Coftan, as a &s;ign of his Ma|je&s;ties favour, and reward of his own re&s;pect. The Grand Signior having by this time his choler &s;omewhat abated, was better pacified with the&s;e gentle words; the Bo&s;tangiba&s;hee al&s;o interce|ding at the &s;ame time in his behalf, that he was a &s;tranger, and ignorant of the cu&s;toms of their Court, and that if he de&s;erved puni&s;hment, he might be remitted to the examination of the Vizi|er, who might cha&s;ti&s;e him, as he found it rea&s;o|nable. The Grand Signior contented herewith, the rude Bo&s;tangees &s;eized the Captain and hur|ried him to the Vi&s;ier, who all this time was igno|rant of his errour or his danger, more than that he perceived by accent of their words, and by their ge&s;tures, that &s;omething was ami&s;s, and debated in reference unto him. The Drugger-men, or Interpreters of the French Nation being &s;ent for, and the Vi&s;ier and the Cap|tain both under&s;tanding the matter, the crime appeared only to be an ab&s;urdity committed through ignorance: yet to plea&s;e the Grand Sig|nior, and to make an appearance, as if &s;omething were done in cha&s;ti&s;ement of this bold curio&s;ity, the Vi&s;ier ordered, that the Captain &s;hould be conducted by two Chaou&s;es to the Amba&s;&s;adour, there to be put in Chains and in Pri&s;on, until &s;a|tisfaction was made for his fault. The Captain being thus brought before the Amba&s;&s;adour, this hone&s;t Gentleman was puni&s;hed in the &s;ame man|ner as we do tho&s;e in Chri&s;tendom, who crowd to &s;ee their Prince.</P>
<P>The Amba&s;&s;adour had his fir&s;t Audience with the Vizier on the 7th of <HI>December,</HI> which being in&s;ignificant to any other bu&s;ine&s;s more than to the delivery of his Ma&s;ters Letters, and other mat|ters

The&s;e Propo&s;als and Di&s;|cour&s;es, though the Vizer &s;eemed not to entertain with that benign and flexible ear as was expect|ed or thought &s;atisfactory, and thereupon &s;everal di&s;gu&s;ts did afterwards &s;ucceed; how&s;oever in the end all matters cleared up again, and his Excellency was permitted to return to his own Hou&s;e with all imaginatble &s;atisfaction, as he was plea&s;ed to intimate to the Amba&s;&s;adour for his Maje&s;ty of great <HI>Britain.</HI> Soon after followed his Audience with the Grand Signior according to the u&s;ual Ceremonies, &s;o that all things run &s;moothly with the French for &s;everal years after. And here by the way it is ob&s;ervable, That an En|gli&s;h Amba&s;&s;adour once arguing hotly with the Vizier on &s;ome points of the Capitulations, in which judging him&s;elf wronged, threw the Ca|pitulations to the Vizier, telling him, that he might keep the Writing and Paper, &s;ince he re&s;olved not to obey the Letter. The Vizier hereupon calmly took the Capitulations, and laid them behind his Cu&s;hion, which the Amba&s;&s;a|dour in a more con&s;iderate temper could not a|gain recover under an expence of fifteen hundred Pieces of Eight.</P>
<P>During the time of the&s;e Negotiations the Grand Signior wholly imployed his time and thoughts in Hunting, ranging all the Woods for &s;e|veral days journies round <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> in which Exerci&s;e twenty or thirty thou&s;and men were imployed, collected from the Cities and Villa|ges round about, all which were paid at the pub|lick expence and charge of Hou&s;e-keepers both Turks and Chr&s;tians;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Grand Signiors Huntings.</NOTE> which in one hunt might amount to thirty or forty thou&s;and Dollars. With this burden the people being often opppre&s;|&s;ed, and many peri&s;hing in the Woods with cold and hunger, began to murmur at the exce&s;s of Tyranny, cur&s;ing their Princes madne&s;s and folly, maintained with the life and ruine of his Sub|jects. But notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e whi&s;pered cur&s;es and &s;ecret menaces the Grand Signior fol|lowed his delights with &s;uch frequency, and with that heat and eagerne&s;s, that the people percei|ving no end of their mi&s;ery, began to &s;peak loud|ly and plainly, and by &s;ome principal Per&s;ons gave the Vi&s;ier to under&s;tand, That the people would not longer endure the extravagant Vagaries of their Prince at &s;o dear a rate, of which he thar was his chief Councellour ought to inform and advi&s;e him. The Vizier, who was be|fore &s;en&s;ible of the exce&s;s of his Ma&s;ters humour in this particular, and that immoderation, even in lawful and innocent exerci&s;es, may become a Vice, and when acted with oppre&s;&s;ion of the Sub|ject as dangerous as other terms which &s;ound more of Tyranny and Violence, re&s;olved with courage and humility to repre&s;ent to his Ma&s;ter the dan|ger of &s;uch expen&s;ive Huntings, e&s;pecially when over frequent; and therefore a&s;&s;ured tho&s;e who made their Complaints, That for the future all matters &s;hould be redre&s;&s;ed, and the Grand Signi|or &s;hould not be &s;o prodigal in his Huntings on the Pur&s;e of his Subjects. And &s;o &s;en&s;ible was the Vizi|er of the di&s;orders which might ari&s;e from hence, if &s;ome remedy were not &s;peedily applied, that he immediately departed <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> to find out the Grand Signior, who was lodged in &s;ome retired cool place, environed with Woods and Mountains; leaving <HI>Solyman</HI> Pa&s;ha for Chimacham, or Deputy, in his place, in who&s;e former Government many terrible Fires had happened in <HI>Con&s;tantinaple.</HI></P>
<P>About this time Advice came to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> of certain Addre&s;&s;es the <HI>Nogay</HI> Tartar had made to the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Sili&s;tria</HI> to obtain a Country to live in between the Rivers of <HI>Bori&s;thene&s;e</HI> and the <HI>Da|nube;</HI> for that their own Country being full,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>No|gay</HI> Tar|tar de|&s;ires Lands of the Grand Signior.</NOTE> they were forced to abandon and empty it of for|ty of fifty thou&s;and Families, who lived in Wag|gons, and had about a hundred thou&s;and head of Cattel, all which with their &s;ub&s;tance, they prof|fered for Subjects to the Grand Signior, if he plea|&s;ed to afford them protection, and Land for Pa|&s;ture and habitation. The Pa&s;ha approving here|of, gave them a&s;&s;urance of &s;ecurity under the &s;ha|dow of his Ma&s;ters favours, &s;ending information thereof to the Port, who willingly embraced the&s;e new-come Gue&s;ts, and entered into con&s;ultation what Country and limits &s;hould be a&s;&s;igned them. In the mean time the <HI>Krim</HI> Tartar jealous of this people, and not knowing what inconvenience &s;uch Neighbourhood might produce, fell upon them, and cut off a great number of them, forcing the re&s;t to reurn into their own Country, which though ill taken at fir&s;t by the Turks, was yet af|terwards excu&s;ed by the Tartar, and di&s;&s;embled by the Port.</P>
<P>Though all things appeared quiet at <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople</HI> after the Peace concluded with the Empe|rour, and that the German Amba&s;&s;adour was returned back to his Ma&s;ter; yet the Turks pro&s;ecuted their de&s;igns again&s;t <HI>Venice,</HI> aad made great preparations in the Provinces of <HI>Albania, Bo&s;&s;ena,</HI> and <HI>Licca,</HI> which confine on the Veneti|an Territories; and though in reality tho&s;e For|ces were not intended again&s;t tho&s;e parts, but in order to a more warm pro&s;ecution of the War in <HI>Candia,</HI> whether the Vizier intended to tran&s;|port him&s;elf in Per&s;on; yet the Venetian State not fully penetrating the De&s;ign, took the Alarm chiefly in <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> and reinforced their Garri&s;ons of <HI>Cataro</HI> and other Fortre&s;&s;es. And that matters there might be well provided, and all things acted with due circum&s;pection; Marqui&s;s <HI>Villa</HI> was or|dered to vi&s;it tho&s;e Garri&s;ons in his Voyage to <HI>Candia;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Marque&s;s <HI>Villa</HI> &s;ur|veys the Forts in <HI>Dalmatia.</HI></NOTE> &s;o that departing from <HI>Venice</HI> attended with two Gallies, he arrived in a few days at <HI>Zara,</HI> and thence proceeding to <HI>Spalato,</HI> where the Pro|veditor General, <HI>Catarin Cornaro,</HI> made at that time his re&s;idence; they both joined together to &s;urvey the mo&s;t important places of that Province. They began with the City of <HI>Spalato,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Spalato.</NOTE> which rather &s;eems a place intended by Nature for a Palace of delights, than a Garri&s;on of Arms; being the Seat which <HI>Diocle&s;ian</HI> (who was born at <HI>Salona,</HI> &s;ix miles di&s;tance from thence) cho&s;e for his Garden of retirement, after he had renounced the Empire, and is now turned into a ruder &s;hape of War, &s;ince the inva&s;ion of the Turk made it nece&s;|&s;ary to be fortified for &s;ecurity of it &s;elf, and the parts circumjacent. <HI>Spalato</HI> is now very &s;trong, be|ing &s;ecured by divers Redoubts; the chief of which is &s;cituated on a little ri&s;ing, called <HI>Grippe,</HI> di&s;tant about a Musket-&s;hot from the Town, is &s;trengthe|ned with four Royal Ba&s;tions, and with good Artil|lery, there is al&s;o a new Line of Fortification drawn round the Town, which renders it the &s;trong|e&s;t, and mo&s;t con&s;iderable of all <HI>Dalmatia:</HI>
<PB N="172" REF="90">But to make this place the more impregnable, the&s;e Generals laid the foundation for another Bulwark; and as an evidence of their Union, they ca&s;t a Medal with a &s;tamp on one &s;ide of <HI>Cornaro,</HI> and on the other of Marquis <HI>Villa,</HI> and &s;o rendring thanks to God, the Service ended with firing all the Guns of the Town.</P>
<P>Afterwards both the Generals Embarking, pa&s;&s;ed that Night to <HI>Curzola,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Curzola.</NOTE> anciently called <HI>Cor&s;ina Negra,</HI> which is one of the greate&s;t and be&s;t of the I&s;les of this Gulf; Thence pa&s;&s;ing by <HI>Ragu&s;i,</HI> where the Deputies of that Government, in recognition of that Soveraignty which the <HI>Ve|netians</HI> have over the <HI>Adriatick</HI> Seas, pre&s;ented the u&s;ual refre&s;hments to the General of the Pro|vince; and in a particular manner treated Mar|quis <HI>Villa</HI> with a Pre&s;ent in name of their Repub|lick. That Night they arrived at the Entrance of the Channel of <HI>Cataro,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cataro &amp; Pera&s;to.</NOTE> and taking <HI>Pera&s;to</HI> in their way (which is a &s;trong Fortification about &s;ix miles di&s;tant from <HI>Cataro</HI>) they were received there with firing all the Guns of the Town, which were doubly multiplied by an Eccho returned from the &s;ound of the neighbouring Mountains. Thence they proceeded to vi&s;it <HI>Budua,</HI> a place well fortified, as al&s;o Fort St. <HI>George</HI> in the I&s;land <HI>Lie&s;ina,</HI> which is the u&s;ual Rendezvous of <HI>Bri|gantines,</HI> and armed Barques; at length they went to <HI>Almi&s;&s;a,</HI> where they made a general Mu&s;ter of all the Forces of the Province; in all which places having viewed and amended the de|fects in Fortification, and given order for &s;upply|ing them with Ammunition and Provi&s;ions nece&s;|&s;ary; they returned back to &s;ee the famous For|tre&s;s of <HI>Cli&s;&s;a,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cli&s;&s;a.</NOTE> the Situation of which &s;eems to have been planted when Nature de&s;ired to &s;port, and be wanton; for it i&s;&s;ues, as it were, out of the Bo&s;om of two Mountains, which are at an equal di&s;tance from the Town, and then draw|ing them&s;elves at each end into the fa&s;hion of a Bow, &s;eem to form a Triumphal Arch. The pa&s;|&s;age through the&s;e Mountains is &s;o narrow and crooked, that it appears like a Labyrinth; and being &s;upplied with plenty of Fountains and Ci|&s;terns both within and without the Fortre&s;s, the Suburbs demol &s;hed, and no incumbrances to cloy and weaken its &s;trength, is certainly more obliged to Nature for its defence than to Art. From hence they proceeded to view <HI>Sebenico,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sebenico.</NOTE> which is another &s;trong Fortre&s;s, &s;ituated on a ri&s;ing Hill, and overviews a &s;pacious Port, the entrance to which is &s;ecured by the Fort St. <HI>Nicho|las;</HI> and the City it &s;elf, be&s;ides its own Walls, is guarded by a Cittadel, and by the new works of St. <HI>John,</HI> &s;ituated on two Hills: From hence the Generals returning to <HI>Zara,</HI> the Capital City of the Province which being encompa&s;&s;ed by the Sea, annexed to the Land only by a Bridg, which is al&s;o defended by a Fort, is rendered the &s;trong|e&s;t and mo&s;t impregnable of all the Fortre&s;&s;es. And here having made a general Mu&s;ter of all the Forces, and vi&s;ited the Country of <HI>Novigrade,</HI> and <HI>Po&s;&s;idaria,</HI> the habitations of the <HI>Morlach</HI> Mi|litia, the Marquis returned again to <HI>Venice,</HI> being called thither by the Senate; for the Year being now well &s;pent, and the Winter approaching too near to admit of any con&s;iderable action; the time grew &s;ea&s;onable for Coun&s;els, in which man|ner the Affairs of Wars might be&s;t and mo&s;t ad|vantageou&s;ly be directed for the &s;ucceeding year. Yet in regard Advices were come from <HI>Candia,</HI> That the <HI>Turks</HI> were much afflicted with the Pe|&s;tilence, and &s;carcity of all Provi&s;ions; it was judged requi&s;ite to pro&s;ecute the War the more eagerly again&s;t them, before the Great Vizier arrived there with &s;uch an Army as commonly at|tends his Per&s;on; it being advi&s;ed from Count <HI>Le&s;lie,</HI> the Emperors Amba&s;&s;ador at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> that the whole force of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Armes was to refund it &s;elf &s;peedily on that I&s;land. This In|telligence ha&s;tned the departure of Marquis <HI>Villa</HI> from <HI>Venice,</HI> with &s;uch Force as was then in a rea|dine&s;s, being directed with nece&s;&s;ary In&s;tructi|ons of what he ought to act in <HI>Candia.</HI> In his Voyage thither he touched at <HI>Corfu, Cefalonia,</HI> and <HI>Zant,</HI> and afterwards happily arrived on the &s;ixth of <HI>December</HI> at the I&s;le of <HI>Paros</HI> or <HI>Pare&s;i</HI> in the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> where he met with the Captain-General, and other Chief Commanders of the Fleet, together with <HI>Vuertmiller</HI> the Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance; and here the Marquis reforming &s;everal Companies, which were much dimini&s;hed in their numbers, a general Mu&s;ter was made of all the Forces, which being ranged in form of Battel, they were accounted to amount unto eighteen hundred Hor&s;e, and eight thou|&s;and two hundred ninety five Foot. This Army had &s;ome want of Fire-Arms, and other Nece&s;|&s;aries, of which the Senate being advi&s;ed, they promi&s;ed to &s;upply all by a Convoy, then pre|paring; and congratulating in their Letters to Marquis <HI>Villa</HI> the good News of his happy Arri|val at <HI>Paros,</HI> rai&s;ed and prompted him to At|chievements worthy his Courage and Grandeur; for being a Per&s;on now elevated on the Bulwarks of <HI>Candia,</HI> he &s;eemed to &s;tand on that Theater, where he had all <HI>Europe</HI> for his Spectators.</P>

<HEAD>The Troubles which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade found this Year in <HI>Turky.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Currant of our Negotiations ran &s;moothly this year without any con&s;idera|ble interruption in all parts of <HI>Turky,</HI> unle&s;s at <HI>Aleppo,</HI> where the Emim, or Cu&s;tomer, accor|ding to his u&s;ual practice, began a new pretence, not only again&s;t former Pre&s;idents, but al&s;o a|gain&s;t the very Letter of Capitulations, deman|ding 2 &frac12; <HI>per Cent.</HI> Cu&s;tom at <HI>Scanderoon,</HI> and 3 at <HI>Aleppo;</HI> a matter again&s;t which our Articles of Peace and Commerce have made many and &s;undry Provi&s;ions: Notwith&s;tanding the Cu&s;to|mer (like others of his Predece&s;&s;ors, who have ever at <HI>Aleppo</HI> made Di&s;putes about their Cu|&s;toms, without being re&s;trained by the mo&s;t &s;trict Imperial Commands, and plaine&s;t Deci&s;ions of the Law) re&s;olved to make good his pretence by a &s;eque&s;tration on the whole Cargo of two gene|ral Ships then under his Cu&s;tody in the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e. The Con&s;ul hereupon had recour&s;e to the Ju&s;tice of the Kadi, and there produced the Ca|pitulations, the Hatte&s;heriff, or Royal Signature, under the hand of Sultan <HI>Ibrahim,</HI> wherein the particulars of Cu&s;tom were regulated, a Com|mand from the pre&s;ent Vizier, and his Father, and other Commands from <HI>Adrianople</HI> and <HI>Con|&s;tantinople,</HI> all of the &s;ame tenour. The Emim on the other &s;ide, had no other Argument than his Baratz or Patent from the Tefterdar or Lord Trea&s;urer, which was &s;o prevalent, and of that force with the Kadi, joined with the fear and fa|vour he bore towards the Emim; that it was judged by him to &s;tand in ballance with all the other Imperial Signatures; and therefore left the bu&s;ine&s;s (which was as much as the Cu&s;tomer de&s;ired) undecided, making a Declaration, that the rea&s;ons on both &s;ides were &s;o forcible, and the arguments &s;o equal, that he concluded it more proper, that a matter of &s;o great importance &s;hould be re&s;erved for the determination of more
<PB N="173" REF="90">powerful and eminent Officers. The matter &s;tan|ding thus doubtfully, the Emim conceiving it too great a pawn to detain &s;o great a quantity of Cloth for a difference only in the Cu&s;tom, deliver|ed to every man his con&s;ignation, re&s;erving only fifty Bales to make him&s;elf good on the judgment and commands he expected &s;hortly in his favour. The difference being now referred up to the Court, the Lord Amba&s;&s;ador received the ju&s;t complaints of the Con&s;ul and Merchants; for redre&s;s of which abu&s;es, his Excellency di&s;patch|ed my &s;elf, then his Secretary and Druggerman, to the Vizier at <HI>Belgrade,</HI> attending the advice of the <HI>German</HI> Amba&s;&s;adors entrance into the Frontiers. The Vizier having heard the difference, was ready to have pa&s;&s;ed &s;entence in our favour, had not the Tefterdar, the only Advocate for the Cu&s;tomer, from whom the Original of our Evils was derived, put an unhappy ob&s;tacle in the cour&s;e of our Negotiations, pretending that there were ancient Tefters or accompts among&s;t his Books, which mentioned two and a half <HI>per Cent.</HI> at <HI>Scanderoon,</HI> and three at <HI>Aleppo;</HI> and though it was urged to the contrary, that we never had to do with the Regi&s;ters of the Trea&s;urers, nor had managed any Apalto, or Farm of the Grand Signior; but our Capitulations are our Law and Rule, and our Commands Regi&s;tred in the Reis Efendi's, or Secretaries Office, than which we never had, nor could ever acknowledg any other Canon: yet the Vizier over-ruled our rea&s;ons, and we were forced to &s;ubmit, until the Tefter|dar took his lei&s;ure to examine and con&s;ult his Books.</P>
<P>The Vizier and his Army being then upon their return, we found no opportunity to renew our &s;ollicitations, until we came to <HI>Ni&s;&s;a,</HI> where the Army had two days of repo&s;e, and there again as in other places before, we urged the Tefterdar &s;o importunately, that at length we compelled him to acknowledg to the Vizier, that our affairs were not Regi&s;tred in his Office. So that now we took liberty to declare our Rea&s;ons to the Vizier; which we drew from our Capitulations, the ancient Hatte&s;heriff of <HI>Aleppo,</HI> the Vizier and his Father's own Commands, and Copies of o|thers of the like tenour, not omitting other Ar|guments and Evidences, which rendered the bu&s;i|ne&s;s not a little clear and apparent to the capaci|ty of the Vizier: who thereupon reprehended the Tefterdar, for &s;eeking by his Command to intro|duce an innovation contrary to our Capitulati|ons, and promi&s;ed us Commands in our favour; but we replied, that we had already Commands, and the Grand Signiors own Royal Signature on our &s;ide, and that our Amba&s;&s;ador had not &s;ent us &s;o many days Journey to &s;eek another, which perhaps would as ill be ob&s;erved as the former; But it was the puni&s;hment of the Cu&s;tomer which the Amba&s;&s;ador expected, who again&s;t &s;o many clear Evidences, dur&s;t proceed to the violation of them all Many other words were added perti|nent and forcible to the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e. To which the Vizier an&s;wered, that he was now up|on his Journey, where bu&s;ine&s;s of this nature was ill di&s;patched. And therefore ordered us to pro|ceed to <HI>Adrianople,</HI> where he &s;hould have more lei&s;ure to con&s;ider what was fit to be done in or|der to ju&s;tice and &s;atisfaction of the Amba&s;&s;ador. Hereupon I left the Army, wherein I was much incommoded, and proceeded with all ha&s;te to <HI>Adrianople,</HI> where the Great Vizier in &s;ome days after me arrived, and there we renewed our wonted endeavours, and &s;ollicitations, that we might come to an end of this bu&s;ine&s;s, and that ju&s;tice might be done us: But the Vizier willing to gratifie the Tefterdar, was not forward to pa&s;s his Sentence, but put us again off to <HI>Con|&s;tantinople,</HI> where the Books &s;hould be peru|&s;ed, that were laid up among&s;t the Regi&s;ters of the <HI>Divan:</HI> For that this matter was a concernment of the Grand Signiors, in deter|mination of which, he ought to be tender and con&s;iderate. That for &s;ending for <HI>Ibrahim</HI> Aga, the Cu&s;tomer (which was one of the princi|pal of our demands) to an&s;wer for the inju|ries he had done our Nation, he was already ordered to appear at Court, where he &s;hould be ready to &s;tand to judgment for what the Amba&s;&s;ador &s;hould object again&s;t him: and this had been the an&s;wer which was contrived to be given to the Amba&s;&s;ador him&s;elf, in ca&s;e he had (as once he de&s;igned) appeared at <HI>Adrianople</HI> in per&s;on on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Vizier arriving at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> &s;ome few Months after; the Lord Amba&s;&s;ador ob|tained Audience of him on the <HI>15th.</HI> of <HI>Octo|ber,</HI> pre&s;&s;ing &s;till for ju&s;tice again&s;t the Cu&s;to|mer of <HI>Aleppo:</HI> but nothing thereof could be procured, be&s;ides a Command for re&s;titution of the fifty Bales of Cloth, detained in the hands of the Emim, upon the pretence before related, and that the payment of Cu&s;toms &s;hould be regulated after the rate of three <HI>per Cent.</HI> according to the ancient u&s;ance. For putting this Command in execution, an Aga was ordered to be di&s;patched, for who&s;e &s;er|vice herein the Vizier allotted a thou&s;and Dol|lars &s;hould be paid him, which though an ex|travagant reward, yet to put an honour and authority on the bu&s;ine&s;s, and not to di&s;plea&s;e the Vizier, it was granted to him, and &s;o he was di&s;patched the <HI>25th.</HI> for <HI>Aleppo.</HI> But the troubles of our Merchants at <HI>Aleppo</HI> ended not here: For the Tefterdar greatly enraged to &s;ee his de&s;igns again&s;t us to have no better i&s;&s;ue, thought to trouble us by a new inven|tion of prohibiting the Scale of <HI>Scanderoon</HI> to all <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and other Chri&s;tian Ve&s;&s;els, and that the Factories &s;hould be transferred again over to <HI>Tripoli</HI> in <HI>Soria;</HI> a place formerly fre|quented by our Merchants, but by rea&s;on of the danger and inconvenience of that Port, the Trade was tran&s;ported to the Scale of <HI>Scanderoon.</HI> This alteration the Tefterdar pre|tended to have been granted to the Merchants at their earne&s;t Petition, and promi&s;e to the Grand Signior, of payment of 13000 Dollars Yearly, for di&s;charge and maintenance of tho&s;e Guards which were requi&s;ite in that place for &s;afety of the Coa&s;t, and defence of the Caravans which pa&s;s with Merchants goods to <HI>Aleppo;</HI> but time and corruption of the Mini&s;ters had depri|ved the Grand Signior of the benefit of that duty. And this he urged with the greater in&s;tance and eagerne&s;s, knowing that the Scale of <HI>Scanderoon</HI> being prohibited, the Hatte&s;heriff whereon con|&s;i&s;ted the priviledg of the Merchants, and their &s;ole &s;ecurity mu&s;t con&s;equently fall, and they forced to a new agreement. On this occa&s;i|on our Lord Amba&s;&s;ador had Audience with the Vizier, and in&s;i&s;ted on that point of our Capitulations, which gives us liberty to Trade in any part of the Grand Signiors Dominions; and therefore to con&s;ent to be re&s;trained, or confined to any particular place, was to a&s;&s;ent to a breach of the Capitulations, which was out of his power, and only to be di&s;pen&s;ed with by his Ma&s;ter the King of <HI>England,</HI> and the Grand Signior, by whom they were e&s;tabli&s;hed; and to connive or a&s;&s;ent to the breach of one particular clau&s;e, was to hazard the lo&s;s and
<PB N="174" REF="91">breach of the whole: for that our Capitulations (to u&s;e the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;aying) are like a &s;tring of Berds, of which, when one link is broken, the others drop off. To which the Vizier replied, that the Scale of <HI>Scandroon</HI> was open, and clear as before for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade; but be|cau&s;e the Te&s;terdar, and Cu&s;tomer, pretended that the Grand Signior was put to great ex|pences for maintenance of a Watch and Guard at that Port, which was only in re&s;pect to the &s;ecurity of the Merchants Goods; Orders &s;hould be given for taking away tho&s;e Officers, as unnece&s;&s;ary and in&s;ignificant to the publick Service; no Guards having ever been in that place, the Emba&s;&s;ador judged his bu&s;ine&s;s to be granted, and &s;o thanked the Vizier and depar|ted. But not many days after the Te&s;terdar procured a Command for &s;hutting the Scale of <HI>Scanderoon,</HI> and tran&s;porting the Factory to <HI>Tri|p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">li:</HI> which Command was rather intended to affright our Nation into &s;ome compo&s;ition, than really to be put in execution, as appeared by the &s;equel; for the Te&s;terdar better con&s;ider|ed than to bring &s;o great an <HI>Odium</HI> upon him|&s;elf from the whole Country and City of <HI>Aleppo,</HI> and to enforce the Emba&s;&s;ador to have recour&s;e to the Grand Signiors own per&s;on, for redre&s;s of an abu&s;e of &s;o high a nature, in derogation of his Imperial Capitulations. How&s;oever it is ob&s;erva|ble in the tran&s;action of all this bu&s;ine&s;s, that it is diccicult to bring a corrupt <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ter to Ju&s;tice or puni&s;hment, meerly for breach of our Capitulations, or in re&s;pect to any difference or abu&s;e offered to Chri&s;tians, unle&s;s the complaint be accompanied with Pre&s;ents or Money, which are mo&s;t prevalent Arguments in the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Court; and in this ca&s;e I really believe, that had three or four thou&s;and Dollars been offered as a reward for bringing the Cu&s;tomer to capital pu|ni&s;hment, the complaint had found acceptance, and honourable &s;ucce&s;s: for default of which, the Cau&s;e was &s;tarved, and naked, and carried no fire or heat in tho&s;e aggravations with which it was repre&s;ented.

<HEAD>Anno <HI>1666.</HI> Hegeira <HI>1077.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE &s;hall begin this Year with the &s;trange rumour and di&s;turbance of the <HI>Jews,</HI> con|cerning <HI>Sabatai Sevi,</HI> their pretended Me&s;&s;iah, which for being mo&s;t principally acted in <HI>Turkey,</HI> may properly belong to the Hi&s;tory of this time and place; which therefore for delight of the Readers, I &s;hall here in&s;ert: for though it may have been el&s;ewhere publi&s;hed, yet being an i&s;&s;ue of my Pen, I may lawfully now own it, and an|nex it to this Hi&s;tory, in re&s;pect of that near co|herence it may have therewith; and that many other particulars have been added thereunto, which &s;ucceeded until the Death of this <HI>Sabatai.</HI></P>
<P>According to the Predictions of &s;everal Chri&s;ti|an Writers, e&s;pecially of &s;uch who comment upon the <HI>Apocalypie</HI> or <HI>Revelations,</HI> this year of 1666. was to prove a year of Wonders, of &s;trange Revolutions in the World, and particularly, of ble&s;&s;ing to the <HI>Jews,</HI> either in re&s;pect of their Conver&s;ion to the Chri&s;tian Faith. or of their Re|&s;toration to their Temporal Kingdom. This opinion was &s;o dilated and fixt in the Countries of the Reformed Religion, and in the heads of Fanatical Enthu&s;ia&s;ts, who dreamed of Fifth Mo|narchies, the down fall of the hope and Anti|chri&s;t, and the greatne&s;s of the <HI>Jews,</HI> in&s;omuch, that this &s;ubtil people judged this Year the time to &s;tir, and to fit their Motion according to the &s;ea&s;on of the Modern Prophecies. Whereupon &s;trange reports flew from place to place, of the March of multitudes of People from unknown parts into the remote de&s;erts of <HI>Arabia,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Ten Tribes and a half, lo&s;t for &s;o many Ages. That a Ship was arrived in the Northern parts of <HI>Scotland,</HI> with her Sails and Cordage of Silk, navigated by Marriners who &s;poke nothing but <HI>Hebrew,</HI> and with this Motto on their Sails, <HI>The Twelve Tribes of I&s;rael.</HI> The&s;e reports agree|ing thus near to former Predictions, put the wild &s;ort of the World into an expectation of &s;trange accidents this Year &s;hould produce in reference to the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Monarchy.</P>
<P>In this manner Millions of people were po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed when <HI>Sabatai Sevi</HI> fir&s;t appeared at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> and publi&s;hed him&s;elf to the <HI>Jews</HI> for their Me&s;|&s;iah, relating the greatne&s;s of their approaching Kingdom, the &s;trong hand whereby God was about to deliver them from Bondage, and ga|ther them from all the parts of the World. It was &s;trange to &s;ee how this fancy took, and how fa&s;t the report of <HI>Sabatai,</HI> and his Doctrine flew through all parts where <HI>Jews</HI> inhabited, and &s;o deeply po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them with a belief of their new Kingdom and Riches; and many of them with promotion to Offices of Government, renown and greatne&s;s; that in all places from <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> to <HI>Buda</HI> (which it was my fortune that Year to travel) I perceived a &s;trange tran&s;port in the <HI>Jews,</HI> none of them attending to any bu&s;ine&s;s, unle&s;s to wind up former Negotiations, and to prepare them&s;elves and Families for a Journey to <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> all their Di&s;cour&s;es, their Dreams, and di&s;po&s;al of their affairs, tended to no other de&s;ign but a re-e&s;tabli&s;hment in the Land of Promi&s;e, to Greatne&s;s and Glory, Wi&s;dom and Doctrine of the Me&s;&s;iah, who&s;e Original, Birth and Education is fir&s;t to be recounted.</P>
<P><HI>Sabatai Sevi</HI> was Son of <HI>Mordecai Sevi,</HI> an In|habitant and Natural of <HI>Smyrna,</HI> who gained his Livelihood by being Broker to an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mer|chant in that place; a per&s;on who before his Death was very decrepit in his Body, and full of the Gout and other infirmities: But his Son <HI>Sabatai Sevi</HI> addicting him&s;elf to &s;tudy and learning, be|came a notable Proficient in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> and <HI>A|rabick</HI> Languages; and e&s;pecially in Divinity and Metaphy&s;icks, he was &s;o cunning a Sophi&s;ter, that he vented a new Doctrine in their Law, and drew to the profe&s;&s;ion of it &s;o many Di&s;ciples, as rai&s;ed one day a tumult in the Synagogue; for which afterwards he was by cen&s;ure of the Kock|hams (who are the Expounders of the Law) ba|ni&s;hed out of the City.</P>
<P>During the time of his Exile he travelled to <HI>The&s;&s;alonica,</HI> now called <HI>Salonica,</HI> where he mar|ried a very hand&s;om Woman; but either not having that part of Oeconomy as to govern a Wife, or being impotent as to Women, as was pretended, or that &s;he &s;ound not favour in his eyes, &s;he was divorced from him. Again, he took a &s;econd Wife more beautiful than the former; but the &s;ame cau&s;es of di&s;content rai&s;ing a differ|ence between them, he obtained another Divorce from this Wife al&s;o. And being now free from the incumbrances of a Family, his wandring head
<PB N="175" REF="91">moved him to travel through the <HI>Morea,</HI> thence to <HI>Tripoli</HI> in <HI>Syria, Gaza</HI> and <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and by the way picked up a <HI>Ligorne&s;e</HI> Lady, whom he made his third Wife, the Daughter of &s;ome <HI>Polo|nian</HI> or <HI>German,</HI> her Original and Country not being very well known. And being now at <HI>Jeru|&s;alem,</HI> he began to reform their Law, and to a|boli&s;h the Fa&s;t of <HI>Tamuz,</HI> (which they keep in the month of <HI>June</HI>) and meeting there with a certain <HI>Jew</HI> called <HI>Nathan,</HI> a proper In&s;trument to promote his de&s;ign, he communicated to him his condition, his cour&s;e of life, and intentions to declare him&s;elf the Me&s;&s;iah of the World, &s;o long expected and de&s;ired by the <HI>Jews.</HI> This de|&s;ign took wonderfully with <HI>Nathan;</HI> and becau&s;e it was thought nece&s;&s;ary, according to Scripture and ancient Prophecies, that <HI>Elias</HI> was to pre|cede the Me&s;&s;iah, as St. <HI>John Bapti&s;t</HI> was the Fore-runner of Chri&s;t, <HI>Nathan</HI> thought no man &s;o proper to act the part of the Prophet as him|&s;elf; and &s;o no &s;ooner had <HI>Sabatai</HI> declared him|&s;elf the Me&s;&s;iah, but <HI>Nathan</HI> di&s;covers him&s;elf to be his Prophet, forbidding all the Fa&s;ts of the <HI>Jews</HI> in <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and declaring that the Bride|groom being come, nothing but joy and triumph ought to dwell in their habitations; writing to all the A&s;&s;emblies of the <HI>Jews</HI> to per&s;wade them to the &s;ame belief. And now the Schi&s;m being be|gun, and many <HI>Jews</HI> really believing what they &s;o much de&s;ired, <HI>Nathan</HI> took the courage and boldne&s;s to prophe&s;ie, That one year from the <HI>27th</HI> of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">June.</NOTE> <HI>Ki&s;lau,</HI> which is the Month of <HI>July,</HI> the Me&s;&s;iah was to appear before the Grand Signior, and to take from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> his Crown, and lead him in chains like a Captive: <HI>Sabatai</HI> al&s;o at <HI>Gaza</HI> preached Repentance to the <HI>Jews,</HI> and Obedi|ence to him&s;elf and Doctrine, for that the Co|ming of the Me&s;&s;iah was at hand. Which novel|ties &s;o affected the <HI>Jews,</HI> Inhabitants of tho&s;e parts, that they gave up them&s;elves wholly to their Prayers, Alms, and Devotions; and to confirm this belief the more, it happened that at the &s;ame time that news hereof with all particulars were di&s;patched from <HI>Gaza,</HI> to acquaint the Brethren in foreign parts; the rumour of the Me&s;&s;iah had flown &s;o &s;wift, and gained &s;uch reception, that Intelligence came from all Countries, where the <HI>Jews</HI> &s;ojourn, by Letters to <HI>Gaza</HI> and <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> congratulating the happine&s;s of their deliverance, and expiration of their time of &s;ervitude by the appearance of the Me&s;&s;iah. To which they ad|joyned other Prophecies relating to that Domini|on the Me&s;&s;iah was to have over all the World, that for nine Months after he was to di&s;appear; during which time the <HI>Jews</HI> were to &s;uffer, and &s;everal of them to undergo Martyrdom; but then returning again mounted on a Coele&s;tial Li|on, with his Bridle made of Serpents with &s;even heads, accompanied with his Brethren the <HI>Jews,</HI> who inhabited on the other &s;ide of the River <HI>Sa|bation,</HI> he &s;hould be acknowledged for the &s;ole Monarch of the Univer&s;e, and then the Holy Tem|ple &s;hould de&s;cend from Heaven already built, framed, and beautified, wherein they &s;hould of|fer Sacrifices for ever. And here I leave the Rea|der to con&s;ider, how &s;trangely this deceived Peo|ple was amu&s;ed, when the&s;e confident and vain reports and dreams of Power and Kingdoms had wholly tran&s;ported them from the ordinary cour&s;e of their trade and intere&s;t.</P>
<P>This noi&s;e and rumour of the Me&s;&s;iah having begun to fill all places, <HI>Sabatai Sevi</HI> re&s;olved to travel towards <HI>Smyrna,</HI> the Country of his Nati|vity, and thence to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> the capital City, where the principal work of preaching was to be performed: <HI>Nathan</HI> thought it not fit to be long after him, and therefore travels by way of <HI>Da|ma&s;cus,</HI> where re&s;olving to continue &s;ome time for better propagation of this new Doctrine, in the mean while writes this Letter to <HI>Sabatai Sevi,</HI> as followeth.</P>

<P>And now all the Cities of <HI>Turkie,</HI> where the Jews inhabited, were full of the expectation of the Me&s;&s;iah, no Trade or cour&s;e of gain was followed; every one imagined, that daily Pro|vi&s;ions, Riches, Honours, and Government were to de&s;cend upon him by &s;ome unknown and mi|raculous manner. An Example of which is mo&s;t ob&s;ervable in the Jews at <HI>The&s;&s;alonica,</HI> who now full of a&s;&s;urance, that the re&s;tauration of their Kingdom, and the accompli&s;hment of the times for the Coming of the Me&s;&s;iah was at hand, judged them&s;elves obliged to double their Devo|tions, and purifie their Con&s;ciences from all &s;ins and enormities; which might be ob&s;erved by the &s;crutiny of him who was now come to pene|trate into the very thoughts and imaginations of Mankind. For which work, certain Kochams were appointed to direct the people in the regu|lation of their Prayers, Devotions, and Fa&s;tings: but &s;o forward was every one now in his acts of Penance, that they &s;tayed not for the &s;en|tence of the Kocham, or Pre&s;criptions or Rules, but applied them&s;elves immediately to Fa&s;tings, and &s;ome in that manner beyond the abilities of Nature, that having for the &s;pace of &s;even days taken no &s;u&s;tenance, were fami&s;hed: others buried them&s;elves in their Gardens, covering their naked bodies with earth, their heads only excepted, remained in tho&s;e beds of dirt, until their bodies were &s;tiffned with the cold and moi&s;ture: others would endure to have melted wax dropt upon their &s;houlders: others to roul them&s;elvs in &s;now, and throw their bodies in the colde&s;t &s;ea&s;on of the winter into the Sea, or frozen waters. But the mo&s;t common man|ner of Mortification was fir&s;t to prick their backs and &s;ides with thorns, and then to give them&s;elves thirty nine la&s;hes. All bu&s;ine&s;s was laid a&s;ide, none worked or opened &s;hop, unle&s;s to clear his Ware-ho&s;e of Merchandi&s;e at any price: who had &s;uperfluity in Hou&s;hold-&s;tuff &s;old it for what he could, but yet not to Jews, who were interdicted from all bargains or &s;ales un|der pain of Excommunication, pecuniary mulcts, or corporal puni&s;hment; for their comportment as to bu&s;ine&s;s and imployment was e&s;teemed the te&s;t or touch-&s;tore of their &s;aith. It being the general Tenent, That in the days that the Me&s;|&s;iah appeared, the Jews &s;hould become Ma&s;ters of the E&s;tates and Inheritance of Infidels; until when, they ought to content them&s;elves with matters only nece&s;&s;ary to maintain and &s;up|port life. But becau&s;e that every one was not Ma&s;ter of that Provi&s;ion and Fortune as to live without daily labour; therefore to quiet the cla|mours of the poor, and prevent the enormous lives of &s;ome, who upon the&s;e occa&s;ions would be|come vagabonds, and de&s;ert their Cities, due order was taken to make collections, which were &s;o liberally be&s;towed, that in <HI>The&s;&s;alonica</HI> only four hundred poor were &s;upported by the meer charity of the richer. And as they endeavoured to purge their con&s;ciences of &s;in, and to apply them&s;elves to good works, that the Me&s;&s;iah might find the City prepared for his reception; &s;o le&s;t he &s;hould accu&s;e them of any om&s;&s;ion in their Law, and particularly in their neglect of that ancient Prcept of Increase and multiply, they married children together of ten years of age, and &s;ome under, without re&s;pect to riche&s;s or poverty, condition or quality; but being pro|mi&s;cuou&s;ly joyned to the number of &s;ix or &s;even hundred couple, upon better and cooler thoughts, after the deceit of the fal&s;e Me&s;&s;iah was di&s;|covered, or the expectation of his Coming grew cold, were divorced, or by con&s;ent &s;eparated from each other.</P>
<P>In the heat of all this talk and rumour came <HI>Sabatai Sevi</HI> to <HI>Smyrna,</HI> the City of his Nativiry, infinitely de&s;ired there by the common Jews, but by the Kochams or Doctors of their Law, who gave little or no credence to what he pre|tended, was ill received, not knowing what mi&s;|chief or ruine this Doctrine and Prophecy of a new Kingdom might produce. Yet <HI>Sabatai</HI> bringing with him Te&s;timonials of his Sanctity, ho|ly Life, Wi&s;dom, and gift of Prophecy &s;o deep|ly fixed him&s;elf in the heart of the generality, both as being holy and wi&s;e, that thereupon he took courage and boldne&s;s to enter into di&s;pute with the Grand Kocham (who is the head or chief Expo&s;itor of their Law, and Superintendent of their civil Government) between whom the ar|guments grew &s;o high, and language &s;o hot, that the Jews who favoured the Doctrine of <HI>Saba|tai,</HI> and feared the Authority of the Kocham, doubtful what might be the i&s;&s;ue of the conte&s;t, appeared in great numbers before the Kaddee of <HI>Smyrna,</HI> in ju&s;tification of their new Prophet, be|fore &s;o much as any accu&s;ation came again&s;t him; the Kaddee according to the cu&s;tom of the Turks &s;wallowed money on both &s;ides, and afterwards remitted them to the determination of their own Ju&s;tice: In this manner <HI>Sabatai</HI> gain|ed ground daily; and the Grand Kocham with his Party, lo&s;ing both the affection and obe|dience of his People, was di&s;placed from his Office, and another con&s;tituted more affectionate and a|greeable to the new Prophet, who&s;e Power daily increa&s;ed by tho&s;e confident reports of his Ene|mies being &s;truck with phren&s;ie and madne&s;s, until being re&s;tored to their former temper and wits by him, became his Friends, Admirers, and Di&s;ciples. No invitation was now made in <HI>Smyr|na</HI> by the Jews, nor Marriage, or Circumci&s;ion held, where <HI>Sabatai</HI> was not pre&s;ent, accompanied to the &s;olemnities with multitudes of his Follow|ers, and the &s;treets covered with Carpets or fine Cloth for him to tread on; but the humility of this Phari&s;ee appeared &s;uch, that he would &s;toop and turn them a&s;ide, and &s;o pa&s;s. And ha|ving thus fixed him&s;elf in the opinion and admira|tion
<PB N="177" REF="92">of the people, he began to take on him&s;elf the Title of Me&s;&s;iah, and the Son of God, and to make this following Declaration to all the Nati|ons of the <HI>Jews,</HI> which being wrote Originally in <HI>Hebrew,</HI> was tran&s;lated for me faithfully into <HI>Italian</HI> in this manner.</P>

<P>Notwith&s;tanding the Di&s;ciples of <HI>Sabatai Sevi,</HI> were not &s;o numerous, but many oppo&s;ed his Doctrine, publickly avouching, that he was an Impo&s;tor, and deceiver of the People, among&s;t which was one <HI>Samuel Pennia,</HI> a man of good E&s;tate and reputation in <HI>Smyrna;</HI> who arguing in the Synagogue, that the pre&s;ent &s;igns of the Coming of the Me&s;&s;iah were not apparent, e|ther according to Scripture, or the Doctrine of Rabbins, rai&s;ed &s;uch a Sedition and Tamult a|mong&s;t the <HI>Jews,</HI> as not only prevailed again&s;t his arguments, but had al&s;o again&s;t his life, had he not timely conveyed him&s;elf out of the Syna|gogue, and &s;o e&s;caped the hands of the Multi|tude, who now could more ea&s;ily endure Bla&s;|phemy again&s;t the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and Prophana|tion of the Sanctuary, than contradiction or mi&s;|belief of the Doctrine of <HI>Sabatai.</HI> But how&s;oever it fell out, <HI>Pennia</HI> in a &s;hort time became a Con|vert, and Preacher up of <HI>Sabatai</HI> for the Son of God, and Deliverer of the <HI>Jews;</HI> and not only he, but his whole Family, his Daughters Pro|phe&s;ie, and fall into &s;trange ec&s;ta&s;ies: and not only this hou&s;e, but above four hundred men and women Prophe&s;ie of the growing Kingdom of <HI>Sabatai,</HI> and young Infants who could &s;carce yet &s;tammer out a &s;yllable to their Mothers, re|peat and pronounce clearly the Name of <HI>Saba|tai</HI> the Me&s;&s;iah and Son of God. For thus far had God permitted the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">evil to delud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> this people, that their very children were for a time po&s;e&s;&s;ed, and voices heard to found from their &s;tomacks and entrails: tho&s;e of riper years fell fir&s;t into a Trance, foamed at the mouth, and recounted the future pro&s;perity and deliverance of the <HI>I&s;|raelites,</HI> their Vi&s;ions of the Lion of <HI>Judah,</HI> and the Triumphs of <HI>Sabatai</HI> All which were cer|tainly true, being effects of Drabolical delu&s;ions, as the <HI>Jews</HI> them&s;elves &s;ince have confe&s;&s;ed to me.</P>
<P>With the&s;e concomitant accidents and &s;ucce&s;&s;es <HI>Sabatai Sevi</HI> growing more pre&s;umptuous, that he might corre&s;pond with the Prophecies of Greatne&s;s and Dominion of the Me&s;&s;iah, procee|ded to Election of tho&s;e Princes which were to govern the I&s;raelites in their March towards the Holy Land, and to di&s;pen&s;e Judgment and Ju|&s;tice after their Re&s;tauration.</P>
<P>In this manner things ran to a &s;trange height of madne&s;s among&s;t the <HI>Jews</HI> at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> when ap|peared &s;uch Pageantry of Greatne&s;s, that no Co|medy could equal the mock-&s;hows they repre&s;en|ted. And though none dur&s;t openly confe&s;s any &s;cruple or doubt of this common received Belief, yet for confirmation of the <HI>Jews</HI> in their Faith, and a&s;toni&s;hment of the Gentiles, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> was judged no le&s;s than nece&s;&s;ary, that <HI>Sabatai</HI> &s;hould &s;hew &s;ome Miracles, whereby to evince all the World that he was the Me&s;&s;iah. And as the pre&s;ent oc|ca&s;ion &s;eemed to require an evidence and convi|ction infallible of this truth, &s;o it was daily exe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e|cted by the Vulgar with an impatience <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">table to humors di&s;po&s;ed to Novelty, who out of eve|ry action and motion of their Prophet, began to fancy &s;omething extraordinary and &s;upernatural. <HI>Sabatai</HI> was now horribly puzzled for a Miracle, though the imagination of the people was &s;o vi|tiated, that any legerdemain or flight of hand would have pa&s;&s;ed more ea&s;ily with them for a Wonder, than <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;triking the Rock for water, or dividing the Red-Sea. And an occa&s;ion happen|ing, that <HI>Sabatai</HI> was in behalf of his Subjects to ap|pear before the Kaddee or Judg of the City, to de|mand ea&s;e and relief of &s;ome oppre&s;&s;ions which aggrieved them; it was thought nece&s;&s;ary a Mi|racle &s;hould be worked now or never, when <HI>Sa|batai</HI> appearing with a formal and Phari&s;aical gravity which he had &s;tarched on, &s;ome on a &s;udden avouched to &s;ee a Pillar of Fire be|tween him and the Kaddee, which report pre|&s;ently was heard through the whole room, filled with <HI>Jews</HI> that accompanied <HI>Sabatai.</HI> Some of w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">om, who &s;trongly fancied it, vowed
<PB N="178" REF="93">and &s;wore they &s;aw it; others in the outwrad Yard, or that could not come near to hear or &s;ee for the crowd, as &s;peedily took the Alarm, and the rumor ran, and belief received by the Women and Children at home in a moment. So that <HI>Sabatai Sevi</HI> returned to his hou&s;e trium|phant, fixed in the hearts of his People, who now needed no farther Miracles to confirm them in their Faith. And thus was <HI>Sabatai</HI> exalted, when no man was thought worthy of communi|cation, who did not believe him for the Me&s;|&s;iah: others were called Kophrim, Infidels, or Hereticks, &s;ubjected to the Cen&s;ure of Excom|munication, with whom it was not lawful &s;o much as to eat. Every man produced his Trea|&s;ure, his Gold, and Jewels, offering them at the feet of <HI>Sabatai;</HI> &s;o that he could have commanded all the Wealth of <HI>Smyrna;</HI> but he was too &s;ubtle to accept their money, le&s;t he &s;hould render his de&s;ign &s;u&s;pected by any acts of covetou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Sabatai Sevi</HI> having thus fully fixed him&s;elf in <HI>Smyrna,</HI> and filled other places with the rumours of him, declared that he was called by God to vi&s;it <HI>Can&s;tantinople,</HI> where the greate&s;t part of his work was to be accompli&s;hed; in order where|unto he privately &s;hipped him&s;elf with &s;ome few Attendants on a Turki&s;h Saike in the month of <HI>January</HI> 1665, le&s;t the crowd of his Di&s;ciples, and &s;uch who would pre&s;s to follow him, &s;hould endanger him in the eyes of the Turks, who al|ready began to be &s;cardalized at the Reports and Prophecies concerning his Per&s;on But though <HI>Sabatai</HI> took few into the Ve&s;&s;el with him, yet multitudes of Jews travelled over land to meet him again at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> on whom all their Eyes and expectations were intent. The Wind proving Northerly, as commonly it is in the <HI>Helle&s;pont</HI> and <HI>Propontis, Sabatai</HI> was thirty nine days in his Voyage, and yet the Ve&s;&s;el not arrived: So little power had this Me&s;&s;iah over the Sea and Winds. In which time the News fore-running to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> that the Jews Me&s;&s;iah was near, all that people prepared to receive him with the &s;ame joy and impatience as was ex|pre&s;&s;ed in other parts where he arrived. The Great Vizier then al&s;o at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> (being not yet departed on his expedition for <HI>Gandia</HI>) ha|ving heard &s;ome rumours of this Man, and the di&s;order and madne&s;s he had rai&s;ed among&s;t the Jews, &s;ent two Boats, whil&s;t the Saik was detain|ed by contrary Winds, with Commands to bring him up Pri&s;oner to the Port, where accordingly <HI>Sabatai</HI> being come, was committed to the mo&s;t loath&s;ome and darke&s;t Dungeon in the Town, there to remain in farther expectation of the Vi|ziers Sentence. The Jews were not at all di&s;cou|raged at this ill Treatment of their Prophet, but rather confirmed in their belief of him, as being an accompli&s;hment of the Prophecy of tho&s;e things which ought to precede his Glory and Dominion; which Con&s;ideration induced the Chiefe&s;t Per&s;ons among&s;t the Jews to make their Vi&s;its and Addre&s;&s;es to him with the &s;ame Cere|mony and Re&s;pect in the Dungeon, as they would have done, had he then &s;ate exalted on the &s;ublime Throne of <HI>Judah.</HI> Several of them, with one <HI>Anacago</HI> by name, a Man of great e&s;teem among&s;t the Jews, attended a whole day before him, with their Eyes ca&s;t down, their Bodies bending forward, and hands cro&s;s'd before them; (which are po&s;tures of humllity and &s;ervice in the Ea&s;tern Parts) the undecency of the place, and pre&s;ent &s;ubjection, not having in the lea&s;t abated their high thoughts and reverence towards his per&s;on.</P>
<P>For the <HI>Jews</HI> in <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> were become as mad and di&s;tracted, as they were in other places, all Trade and Traffick forbidden, and tho&s;e who owed Money, in no manner careful how to &s;atisfie it; among&s;t which wild Crew, &s;ome were indebted to our Merchants at <HI>Galata,</HI> who not knowing the way to receive their Money, partly for their intere&s;t, and partly for curio&s;ity, thought fit to vi&s;it this <HI>Sabatai,</HI> complaining, That &s;uch particular <HI>Jews,</HI> upon his Coming, took upon them the boldne&s;s to defraud them of their right, and de&s;ired he would be plea&s;ed to &s;ig|nifie to tho&s;e his Subjects, his plea&s;ure to have &s;atisfaction given.</P>
<P>Whereupon <HI>Sabatai,</HI> with much affectation, took Pen and Paper, and wrote to this effect.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>To you of the Nation of the <HI>Jews,</HI> who ex|pect the appearance of the Me&s;&s;iah, and the Salvation of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> Peace without end.

</LETTER>
<P>In this manner <HI>Sabatai Sevi</HI> remained a Pri&s;o|ner at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> for the &s;pace of two Months; at the end of which the Vizier having de&s;ign|ed his expedition for <HI>Candia,</HI> and con&s;idering the rumour and di&s;turbance the Pre&s;ence of <HI>Saba|tai</HI> had made already at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> thought it not &s;ecure to &s;uffer him to remain in the impe|rial City, whil&s;t both the Grand Signior and him|&s;elf were ab&s;ent; and therefore changed his Pri&s;on to the <HI>Dardanelli,</HI> otherwi&s;e called the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Abydos,</HI> being on the <HI>Europe</HI> &s;ide of the <HI>Helle&s;pont,</HI> oppo&s;ite to <HI>Se&s;tos,</HI> places famous in <HI>Greek</HI> Poetry. This removal of <HI>Sabatai</HI> from a wor&s;e Pri&s;on, to one of a better Air, confirmed the <HI>Jews</HI> with greater confidence of his be|ing the Me&s;&s;iah, &s;uppo&s;ing that had it been in the power of the Vizier, or other Officers of the <HI>Turks,</HI> to have de&s;troyed his Per&s;on, they would never have permitted him to live unto that time, in regard their Maximes enforce them to quit all jealou&s;ies and &s;u&s;picions of ruine to their State by the death of the Party feared; which much rather they ought to execute on <HI>Sabatai,</HI> who had not only declared him&s;elf the King of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> but al&s;o by Prophecies publi&s;hed fa|tal things to the Grand Signior and his King|doms.</P>
<P>With this Con&s;ideration, and others prece|ding, the <HI>Jews</HI> flocked in great numbers to the Ca&s;tle, where he was impri&s;oned, not only from the Neighbouring parts, but al&s;o from <HI>Poland, Germany, Ligorn, Venice, Am&s;terdam,</HI> and other places, where the <HI>Jews</HI> re&s;ide; on all whom, as a reward of the expence and labours of their Pil|grimage, <HI>Sabatai</HI> be&s;towed plenty of his Be|nedictions, promi&s;ing encrea&s;e of their Store, and enlargement of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the Holy Land. So great was the confluence of the <HI>Jews</HI> to this place, that the <HI>Turks</HI> thought it requi&s;ite to make their advantage thereof, and &s;o not only rai&s;ed the price of their Provi&s;ions, Lodgings, and other nece&s;&s;aries, but al&s;o denied to ad|mit any to the pre&s;ence of <HI>Sabatai,</HI> unle&s;s for Mo|ney, &s;etting the price &s;ometimes at Five, &s;ome|times at ten Dollars, or more or le&s;s, according as they gue&s;&s;ed at the abilities and zeal of the Per&s;on; by which gain and advantage to the <HI>Turks,</HI> no Complaints or Advices were carried to <HI>Adrianople,</HI> either of the Concour&s;e or Arguments
<PB N="179" REF="93">among&s;t the <HI>Jews</HI> in that place, but rather all Ci|vilities and Liberties indulged unto them, which &s;erved as a farther Argument to en&s;nare this poor People in the belief of their Me&s;&s;iah.</P>
<P>During this time of Confinement <HI>Sabatai</HI> had lei&s;ure to compo&s;e and in&s;titure a New Method of Wor&s;hip for the <HI>Jews,</HI> and principally the manner of the Celebration of the Day of his Na|tivity, which he pre&s;cribed in this manner.</P>

And as to matters of labour, and other things of like nature, do as becomes you upon a day of Fe&s;ti|val, adorned with your fine&s;t Garments. As to your Prayers, let the &s;ame Order be u&s;ed as upon Fe&s;tivals. To conver&s;e with Chri&s;tians on that day is unlawful, though your Di&s;cour&s;e be of matters indifferent; all labour is for|bidden, but to &s;ound In&s;trument is law|ful.</P>

And for the Le&s;&s;on out of the Pro|phets, u&s;ually read in the Synagogue every Sabbath you &s;hall repeat the Thirty fir&s;t Chap|ter of <HI>Jeremiah</HI> to your Prayer called the Mu&s;&s;af (u&s;ed in the Synagogue every Sabbath and &s;Olemn Fe&s;tival.) In&s;tead of the Sacrifice of Addition at the returning of the Bible to its place, you &s;hall read with an audible Voice, and clear Sound, and with holy Harmony, the Ninty fifth P&s;alm.

<P>Be&s;ides which Order and Method of Liturgy for Solemnization of his Birth, he pre&s;cribed other Rules for Divine Service, and particularly publi&s;hed the &s;ame Indulgence and priviledge to every one who &s;hould pray at the Tomb of his Mother, as if he had taken on him a Pilgrimage to pray and &s;acrifice at <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> The Devo|tion of the <HI>Jews</HI> towards this pretended Me&s;&s;iah, encrea&s;ed &s;till more and more; &s;o that not only the chief of the City went to attend and proffer their &s;ervice towards him in the time of his Im|pri&s;onment, but likewi&s;e decked their Syna|gogue with <HI>S.

<P>How&s;oever &s;ome of the <HI>Jews</HI> remained in their Wits all this time, among&s;t which was a certain Cocham at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> one zealous of his Law, and of the good and &s;afety of his Nation; and ob&s;erving in what a wild manner the whole Peo|ple of the <HI>Jews</HI> was tran&s;ported with the gronnd|le&s;s belief of a Me&s;&s;iah, leaving not only their Trades, and cour&s;e of Living, but publi&s;hing Prophecies of a &s;peedy Kingdom, of re&s;cue from the tyranny of the <HI>Turk,</HI> and leading the Grand Signior him&s;elf captive in Chains; matters &s;o dangerous, and obnoxious to the State wherein they lived, as might ju&s;tly convict them of Trea|&s;on and Rebellion, and leave them to the mer|cy of that Ju&s;tice, which on the lea&s;t jealou&s;ie and &s;u&s;picion of matters of this nature, u&s;es to extirpate Families, and &s;ubvert the Man&s;ion hou&s;es of their own People, much rather of the <HI>Jews,</HI> on whom the <HI>Turks</HI> would gladly take this occa&s;ion to de&s;poil them of their E&s;tates, and
<PB N="180" REF="94">condemn the whole Nation to perpetual Slavery. And indeed it would have been a greater wonder than ever <HI>Sabatai</HI> &s;hewed, that the <HI>Turks</HI> took not advantage from all the&s;e extravagancies to drain the <HI>Jews</HI> of a con&s;iderable Sum of Mo|ney, and &s;et their whole Race in <HI>Turky</HI> at a Ran|&s;ome, had not the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages yielded them matter of pa&s;time, and been the &s;ubject of the <HI>Turks</HI> laughter and &s;corn, &s;uppo&s;ing it a di&s;paragement to the greatne&s;s of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, to be concerned for the rumours and combu&s;tions of this de&s;pi&s;ed People. With the&s;e Con&s;iderations this Cocham, that he might clear him&s;elf of the blood and guilt of his Countrymen, and un|concerned in the common de&s;truction, went be|fore the Kaddee, and there prote&s;ted again&s;t the pre&s;ent Doctrine, declaring, That he had no hand in &s;etting up of <HI>Sabatai,</HI> but was an ene|my both to him and his whole Sect. This free|dom of the Cocham &s;o enraged and &s;candalized the <HI>Jews,</HI> that they judged no Condemnation or Puni&s;hment too &s;evere again&s;t &s;uch an Of|fender, and Bla&s;phemer of their Law, and Ho|line&s;s of the Me&s;&s;iah, and therefore with Money and pre&s;ents to the Kaddee, accu&s;ing him as di&s;obedient in a Capital nature to their Go|vernment, obtained &s;entence again&s;t him to &s;have his Beard, and commit him to the Gallies.</P>
<P>There wanted nothing now to the appearance of the Me&s;&s;iah, and the Solemnity of his Com|ing, but the pre&s;ence of <HI>Elias,</HI> which the <HI>Jews</HI> began to expect hourly, and with that attention and earne&s;tne&s;s, that a Dream or Phanta&s;m to every weak Head was judged to be <HI>Elias,</HI> it be|ing taught and averred, that he was &s;een in di|vers Forms and Shapes, not to be certainly di&s;|covered or known before the Coming of the Me&s;|&s;iah. For this Superi&s;tition is &s;o far fixed among&s;t them, that generally in their Families they &s;pread a Table for <HI>Elias</HI> the Prophet to which they make an invitation of poor People, leaving the chief place for the Lord <HI>Elias,</HI> whom they believe to be invi&s;ibly pre&s;ent at the Entertainment, and there to eat and drink without diminution either of the Di&s;hes or the Cup. One Per&s;on among&s;t the <HI>Jews</HI> commanded his Wife, after a Sup|per of this kind, to leave the Cup filled with Wine, and the Meat &s;tanding all Night for <HI>Elias</HI> to fea&s;t and rejoyce alone, and in the Morn|ing ari&s;ing early, affirmed, That <HI>Elias</HI> took this Banquet &s;o kindly, that in token of gratitude and acceptance, he had repleni&s;hed the Cup with Oyl in&s;tead of Wine. It is a cu&s;tom among&s;t the <HI>Jews</HI> on the Evening of the Sabbath to re|peat certain prai&s;es of God. <HI>(Haudola)</HI> which &s;ig|nifies a di&s;tinction or &s;eparation of the Sabbath from the prophane days (as they call them;) which prai&s;es or ble&s;&s;ing they ob&s;erve to perform in this manner. One takes a Cup filled with Wine, and drops it through the whole Hou&s;e in the name of <HI>Elias,</HI> &s;aying, Elias <HI>the Prophet,</HI> Elias <HI>the Pro|phet, come quickly to us with the Me&s;&s;iah the Son of</HI> David. And this, they affirm, is &s;o acceptable to <HI>Elias,</HI> that he never fails to pre&s;erve that Fa|mily &s;o devoted to him, and augment it with the Ble&s;&s;ings of encrea&s;e. Many other things the <HI>Jews</HI> avouch of <HI>Elias,</HI> &s;o ridiculous, as are not nece&s;&s;ary to be declared, among&s;t which this one is not from our purpo&s;e, That at the Circumci|&s;ion there is always a Chair &s;et for <HI>Elias.</HI> And <HI>Sa|batai Sevi</HI> being once invited at <HI>Smyrna</HI> to the Cir|cumci&s;ion of the fir&s;t born Son of one <HI>Abraham Gutiere,</HI> a Kin&s;man of <HI>Sabatai,</HI> and all things ready for the Ceremony; <HI>Sabatai Sevi</HI> exhorted the Parents of the Child to expect a while until his farther order. After a good half hour <HI>Saba|tai</HI> ordered them to proceed, and cut the Pre|pucee of the Child, which was in&s;tantly perform|ed with all joy and &s;atisfaction to the Parents: and being afterwards demanded, wherefore he retarded the performance of that Function; his an&s;wer was, That <HI>Elias</HI> had not as yet taken his Seat, whom as &s;oon as he &s;aw pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">d, he order|ed them to proceed: and that now &s;hortly <HI>Elias</HI> would di&s;cover him&s;elf openly, and proclaim the news of their general Redemption. This being the common opinion of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and that <HI>Saba|tai Sevi</HI> was the Me&s;&s;iah, being become an Article of Faith, it was not hard to per&s;wade them that <HI>Elias</HI> was come already, that they met him in their di&s;hes, in the dark, in their Bed-chambers, or any where el&s;e invi&s;ible, in the &s;ame manner as our common People believe of Hobgoblins and Faries. For &s;o it was, when one <HI>Solomon Cremona,</HI> an Inhabitant of <HI>Smyrna,</HI> making a great Fea&s;t, to which the principal <HI>Jews</HI> of that City were in|vited, after they had eaten and drank freely, one &s;tarted from his &s;eat, and avouched that he &s;aw <HI>Elias</HI> upon the VVall, and with that bows to him, and complements him with all reve|rence and humility: &s;ome others having in like manner their fancies already prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and their eyes with the fume of VVine ill prepared to di&s;tingui&s;h &s;hadows, immediately agreed up|on the object, and then there was not one in the Company who would &s;ay, he did not &s;ee him; at which &s;urpri&s;e every one was &s;truck with re|verence and awe, and the mo&s;t eloquent among&s;t them having their tongues loo&s;ed with Joy and VVine, directed Orations, Encomiums, and acts of thankfulne&s;s to him, courting and complement|ing <HI>Elias,</HI> as di&s;tracted Lovers do the &s;uppo&s;ed pre&s;ence of their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Another <HI>Jew</HI> at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> reported, That he met <HI>Elias</HI> in the &s;treets, habited like a <HI>Turk,</HI> with whom he had a long communication, and that he injoin'd the ob&s;ervation of many neglected Ceremonies, and particularly the Zezit, <HI>Lev</HI> 15.38. <HI>Speak unto the Children of</HI> I&s;rael <HI>and bid them, that they make fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of the border a Ribband of Blue.</HI> Al&s;o the Peotz, <HI>Levit.</HI> 19.27. <HI>Ye &s;hall not round the corners of your Head, nor mar the corner of your Beard.</HI> This apparition of <HI>Elias</HI> being publi&s;hed, and as &s;oon believed, every one began to obey the Vi|&s;ion, by fringing their garments; and for their heads, though always &s;haved according to the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> and Ea&s;tern fa&s;hion, and that the &s;uffering hair to grow, to men not accu&s;tomed, was heavy and incommodions for their health and heads; yet to begin again to renew, as far as was po&s;&s;i|ble, the ancient Ceremonies, every one nouri&s;h|ed a Lock of hair on each &s;ide, which was vi&s;ible beneath their Caps, which &s;oon after began to become a &s;ign of di&s;tinction between the Believers and the Koparims, a name of di&s;honour, &s;ignify|ing as much as Unbelievers or Heretick, given to tho&s;e who confe&s;&s;ed not <HI>Sabatai</HI> to be the Me&s;|&s;iah. VVhich particulars, if not ob&s;erved, it was declared as a menace of <HI>Elias,</HI> That the Peo|ple of the <HI>Jews</HI> who came from the River <HI>Saba|tion,</HI> as is &s;pecified in the 2. <HI>E&s;dras Cap.</HI> 13. &s;hall take vengeance of tho&s;e who are guilty of the&s;e omi&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>But to return again to <HI>Sabatai Sevi</HI> him&s;elf, we find him &s;till remaining a Pri&s;oner in the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Abydos</HI> upon the <HI>Helle&s;pont,</HI> admired and adored by his Brethren with more honour than before, and vi&s;ited by Pilgrims from all parts, where the Fame of the Coming of the Me&s;&s;iah had arri|ved: Among&s;t which one from <HI>Poland</HI> named <HI>Ne|hemiah
<PB N="181" REF="94">Cohen</HI> was of &s;pecial note and renown, learned in the <HI>Hebrew, Syriack,</HI> and <HI>Chaldee,</HI> and ver&s;ed in the Doctrine and Kabala of the Rab|bins, as well as <HI>Sabatai</HI> him&s;elf One (of whom it was &s;aid) had not this <HI>Sevi</HI> anticipated the de|&s;ign, e&s;teemed him&s;elf as able a Fellow for to act a Me&s;&s;iah as the other. How&s;oever it being now too late to publi&s;h any &s;uch pretence, <HI>Sabatai</HI> having already prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the office, and with that the hearts and belief of the <HI>Jews, Nehemi|ah</HI> was contented with &s;ome &s;mall appendage or relation to a Me&s;&s;iah; and therefore to lay his de&s;ign the better, de&s;ired a private Conference with <HI>Sabatai.</HI> The&s;e two great Rabbins be|ing together, a hot Di&s;pute aro&s;e between them. For <HI>Cohen</HI> alledged, That according to Scrip|ture and Expo&s;ition of the Learned thereupon, there were to be two Me&s;&s;iahs, one called <HI>Bon Ephraim,</HI> and the other <HI>Ben David:</HI> The fir&s;t was to be a Preacher of the Law, poor and de&s;pi|&s;ed, and a Servant to the &s;econd, and his Fore|runner; the other was to be great and rich, to re&s;tore the <HI>Jews</HI> to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> to &s;it upon the Throne of <HI>David,</HI> and to perform and act all tho&s;e Triumphs and Conque&s;ts, which were expected from <HI>Sabatai. Nehemiah</HI> was contented to be <HI>Ben Ephraim,</HI> the afflicted and poor Me&s;&s;iah, and <HI>Sabatai</HI> was well enough contented he &s;hould be &s;o; but that <HI>Nehemiah</HI> accu&s;ed him for being too forward in publi&s;hing him&s;elf the latter Me&s;|&s;iah, before <HI>Ben Ephraim</HI> had fir&s;t been known to the World. <HI>Sabatai</HI> took this reprehen&s;ion &s;o ill, either out of pride and thoughts of his own Infallibility, or that he &s;u&s;pected <HI>Nehemiah</HI> being once admitted for <HI>Ben Ephraim,</HI> would quickly, being a &s;ubtle and learned Per&s;on, per&s;wade the World that he was <HI>Ben David,</HI> would by no means under&s;tand or admit of this Doctrine, or of <HI>Ben Ephraim</HI> for a nece&s;&s;ary Officer: And thereupon the Di&s;pute grew &s;o hot, and the Con|trover&s;ie &s;o irreconcileable, as was taken notice of by the <HI>Jews,</HI> and controverted among&s;t them as every one fancied; but <HI>Sabatai</HI> being of greater Authority, his Sentence prevailed, and <HI>Nehe|miah</HI> was rejected as Schi&s;matical, and an Enemy to the Me&s;&s;iah, which afterwards proved the ruine and downfal of this Impo&s;ture. For <HI>Nehe|miah</HI> being thus baffled, and being a Per&s;on of Authority, and a haughty Spirit, meditated no|thing but revenge; to execute which to the full, he took a Journey to <HI>Adrianople,</HI> and there inform|ed the chief Mini&s;ters of State and Officers of the Court, who (by rea&s;on of the gain the <HI>Turks</HI> made of their Pri&s;oner at the Ca&s;tle on the <HI>Helle|&s;pont</HI>) heard nothing of all this concour&s;e of Peo|ple, and Prophecies of the Revolt of the <HI>Jews</HI> from their obedience to the Grand Signior. And taking likewi&s;e to his Coun&s;el &s;ome certain di&s;|contented and unbelieving Cochams, who being zealous for their Nation, and jealous of the ill con&s;equences of this long continued and increa|&s;ing madne&s;s, took liberty to inform the Chima|cam (who was Deputy of the Great Vizier then at <HI>Candia</HI>) that the <HI>Jew,</HI> Pri&s;oner at the Ca&s;tle, cal|led <HI>Sabatai Sevi</HI> was a lewd per&s;on, and one who endeavoured to debauch the minds of the <HI>Jews,</HI> &amp; divert them from their hone&s;t cour&s;e of livelihood, &amp; obedience to the Grand Signior and that there|fore it was nece&s;&s;ary to clear the World of &s;o fa|ctious and dangerous a Spirit. The Chimacam be|ing thus inform'd could do no le&s;s than acquaint the Gr. Signior with all the particulars of this mans condition, cour&s;e of life, and Doctrine; which were no &s;ooner under&s;tood, but a Chaou&s;e or Me&s;&s;enger was immediately di&s;patched to bring up <HI>Sabatai Sevi</HI> to <HI>Adrianople.</HI> The Chaou&s;e executed his Commi&s;&s;ion after the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> fa|&s;hion in ha&s;te, bringing <HI>Sabatai</HI> in a few days to <HI>Adrianople,</HI> without farther excu&s;e or ceremony, not affording him an hours Space to take a &s;olemn farewel of his Followers and Adorers, who now were come to the vertical point of all their hopes and expectations.</P>
<P>The Grand Signior having by this time re|ceived divers informations of the made&s;s of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and the pretences of <HI>Sabatai,</HI> grew big with de&s;ire and expectation to &s;ee him; &s;o that he no &s;ooner arrived at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> but the &s;ame hour he was brought before the Grand Signior. <HI>Sa|batai</HI> appeared much dejected, and failing of that courage which he &s;hewed in the Syna|gogue. And being demanded &s;everal que&s;tions in Turki&s;h by the Grand Signior, he would not tru&s;t &s;o far to the vertue of his Me&s;&s;iah&s;hip, as to deliver him&s;elf in the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Language, but de&s;ired a Doctor of Phy&s;ick (who had from a <HI>Jew</HI> turned <HI>Turk</HI>) to be his Interpreter, which was granted to him, but not without reffection of the &s;tanders-by, that had he been the Me&s;&s;iah and Son of God, as he formerly pretended, his Tongue would have been loo&s;ed into Eloquence and perfection of Languages. But the Grand Sig|nior would not be put off without a Miracle, and it mu&s;t be one or his own chu&s;ing; which was, that <HI>Sabatai</HI> &s;hould be &s;tripped naked, and &s;et as a mark to his dextrous Archets; if the ar|rows pa&s;&s;ed not his body, but that his fle&s;h and skin was proof, like Armour, then he would be|lieve him to be the Me&s;&s;iah, and the Per&s;on whom God had de&s;igned to tho&s;e Dominions and Greatne&s;s he pretended. But now <HI>Sabatai</HI> not having Faith enough to &s;tand to &s;o &s;harp a tryal, renounced all his Title to Kingdoms and Go|vernments, alledging that he was an ordinary Cocham and Jew, as others were, and had no|thing of priviledge and virtue above the re&s;t. The Grand Signior notwith&s;tanding, not wholly &s;atis|fied with this plain confe&s;&s;ion, declared, That ha|ving given publick &s;candal to the Profe&s;&s;ors of the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Religion and done di&s;honour to his Soveraign Authority, by pretending to with|draw from him &s;o con&s;iderable a portion as the Land of <HI>Pale&s;tine,</HI> his Trea&s;on and Crime could not be expiated without becoming a <HI>Maho|metan</HI> Convert: Which if he refu&s;ed to do, the Stake was ready at the Gate of the Seraglio to impale him. <HI>Sabatai</HI> being now reduced to his la&s;t game and extremity, not being in the lea&s;t doubtful what to do, for to dye for what he was a&s;&s;ured was fal&s;e was again&s;t Nature, and the death of a mad man: Replied with much chear|fulne&s;s, that he was contented to turn <HI>Turk,</HI> and that it was not of force, but of choice, ha|ving been a long time de&s;irous of &s;o glorious a profe&s;&s;ion, he e&s;teemed him&s;elf much honoured, that he had an opportunity to own it fir&s;t in the pre&s;ence of the Grand Signior. And here was the <HI>Non plus ultra</HI> of all the blu&s;ter and noi&s;e of this vain Impo&s;tour. And now the Reader may pau&s;e a while, and contemplate the &s;trange point of con&s;ternation, &s;hame, and &s;ilence, to which the <HI>Jews</HI> were reduced, when they under|&s;tood how &s;peedily their hopes were vani&s;hed, and how poorly and ignominiou&s;ly all their fancies and promi&s;es of a new Kingdom, their Pageantry and Offices for Devotion were pa&s;t like a tale, or a midnights dream. And all this was con|cluded, and the <HI>Jews</HI> sunk on a &s;udden and fallen flat in their hopes, without &s;o much as a line of comfort or excu&s;e from <HI>Sabatai,</HI> more than in general to all the Brethren, that now they &s;hould apply them&s;elves to their callings and &s;ervices
<PB N="182" REF="95">of God, as formerly; for that matters relating to him were fini&s;hed, and the &s;entence pa&s;t.</P>
<P>The News of <HI>Sabatai</HI> turning Turk, and of the Me&s;&s;iah to a Mahometan, quickly filled all parts of <HI>Turky;</HI> the <HI>Jews</HI> were &s;trangely &s;urpri&s;ed at it, and a&s;hamed of their ea&s;ine&s;s of belief, of the ar|guments with which they had per&s;waded o|thers, and of the Pro&s;elytes they had made in their own Families. Abroad they became the common deri&s;ion of the Towns where they in|habited, the Boys houted after them, coining a new word at <HI>Smyrna (Pouftai)</HI> which every one &s;eeing a Jew, with a &s;inger pointed out, would pronounce with &s;corn and contempt; &s;o that this deceived People for a long time after re|mained with confu&s;ion, &s;ilence, and dejection of &s;pirit. And yet mo&s;t of them affirm, That <HI>Sa|batai</HI> is not turned Turk, but his &s;hadow only remains on Earth, and walks with a white head, and in the habit of a <HI>Mahometan;</HI> but that his Body and Soul are taken into Heaven, there to re&s;ide until the time appointed for accompli&s;h|ment of the&s;e Wonders: And this opinion began &s;o commonly to take place, as if this People re|&s;olved never to be undeceived, u&s;ing the Forms and Rules for Devotion pre&s;cribed them by their <HI>Mahometan</HI> Me&s;&s;iah. In&s;omuch that the Cochams of <HI>Con&s;tantenople</HI> fearing the danger of this Er|rour might creep up and equal the former, con|demned the belief of <HI>Sabatai</HI> being Me&s;&s;iah as damnable, and injoyned them to return to the an|cient Method and Service of God, upon pain of Excommunication. The Stile and Tenour of their Letter was as followeth.</P>

<P>We command you, That with your Au|thority, under pain of Excommunicati|on and other Penalties, all tho&s;e Ordi|nances and Prayers, as well tho&s;e delivered by the mouth of that man, as tho&s;e which he injoyned by the mouth of others, be all abo|li&s;hed and made void, and to be found no more, and that they never enter more into your hearts; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> according to the ancient Commandment of your Forefathers, repeating the &s;ame Le&s;&s;ons and Prayers every Sab|bath as hath been accu&s;tomary; as al&s;o the Collects for Kings, Potentates, and Anoint|ed, &amp;c. and ble&s;s the King <HI>Sultan Maho|met;</HI> for in his dayes hath great Salvati|on been wrought for <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and become not Rebels to his Kingdom, which God forbid.

<P>During the time of all the&s;e tran&s;actions and pa&s;&s;ages at <HI>Con&s;tantinople, Smyrna, Abydos</HI> upon the <HI>Helle&s;pont,</HI> and <HI>Adrianople;</HI> the <HI>Jews</HI> leaving their mercantile cour&s;e and advices what prices Commodities bore, and matters of Traffick, &s;tuffed their Letters for <HI>Italy</HI> and other parts with nothing but wonders and miracles wrought by their Me&s;&s;iah. As that, when the Grand Signior &s;ent to take him, he cau&s;ed all the me&s;&s;engers immediately to die; upon which, other Janiza|ries being again &s;ent, they all fell dead with a word only from his mouth; and being de&s;ired to revive them again, he immediately recalled them to life, but of them only &s;uch, who were true Turks, and not tho&s;e who had denied that Faith in which they were born, and had profe&s;&s;ed. Af|ter this they added, that he went voluntarily to Pri&s;on, and though the Gates were barred, and &s;hut with &s;trong Locks of Iron, yet that <HI>Sabatai</HI> was &s;een to walk through the &s;treets with a nu|merous attendance; and when they laid &s;hac|kles on his Neck and Feet, they not only fell from him, but were converted into Gold, with which he gratified his true and faithful Believers and di&s;ciples. Some Miracles al&s;o were report|ed of <HI>Nathan,</HI> that only at the reading of the name of any particular Man or Woman, he could immediately recount the &s;tory of his or her Life, their &s;ins or defaults, and accordingly impo&s;e ju&s;t correction and penance for them. The&s;e &s;trong reports coming thus confidently into <HI>Italy,</HI> and all parts, the <HI>Jews</HI> of <HI>Ca&s;al di Monferrato</HI> re&s;olv'd to

But that they might return to their Brethren at home with the cer|tain particulars of the &s;ucce&s;s of the&s;e affairs, they made a vi&s;it to the Brother of <HI>Sabatai,</HI> who &s;till continued to per&s;wade them, that <HI>Sa|batai</HI> was notwith&s;tanding the true Me&s;&s;iah; that it was not he who had taken upon him the hahit and form of a Turk, but his Angel or Spirit, his Body being a&s;cended into Heaven, until God &s;hall again &s;ee the &s;ea&s;on and time to re&s;tore it; adding farther, that an effect hereof they &s;hould &s;ee by the Prophet <HI>Nathan</HI> verifyed, now every day expected, who having wrought Miracles in many places, would al&s;o for their con&s;olation, reveal hidden &s;ecrets unto them, with which they &s;hould not only remain &s;atisfied but a&s;toni&s;hed: with this only hope of <HI>Nathan,</HI> the&s;e Legates were a little comforted, re&s;olving to attend his arrival, in regard they had a Letter to con&s;ign into his hands, and according to their in&s;tructi|ons, were to demand of him the grounds he had for his Prophecies, and what a&s;&s;urance he had that he was divinely in&s;pired, and how tho&s;e things were revealed unto him, which he had committed to Paper, and di&s;per&s;ed to all parts of the World.</P>
<P>At length <HI>Nathan</HI> arrived near <HI>Smyrna,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1666/7.</NOTE> on <HI>Friday</HI> the 3d of <HI>March,</HI> towards the Evening, and on <HI>Sunday</HI> the&s;e Legats made their vi&s;it to him, but <HI>Nathan</HI> upon the news of what &s;ucce&s;s his Me&s;&s;iah met with, began to grow &s;ullen and re&s;erved, &s;o that the Legats could &s;carce pro|cure admittance to him; all that they could do, was to inform him, that they had a Letter to him from the Brotherhood of <HI>Italy,</HI> and Commi&s;|&s;ion to confer with him concerning the ground and foundation of his Prophecies: But <HI>Nathan</HI> refu&s;ed to take the Letter, ordering <HI>Kaim Abo|lafio,</HI> a Cocham of the City of <HI>Smyrna,</HI> to re|ceive it; &s;o that the Legats returned little con|tented, but yet with hopes at <HI>Nathans</HI> arrival at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> to receive better &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>But whil&s;t <HI>Nathan</HI> intended to enter into <HI>Smyr|na,</HI> the Cochams of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> being before advi&s;ed of his re&s;olution to take a Journey into their parts, not knowing by which way he might come, &s;ent their Letters and orders to <HI>Smyrna, Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> and every way round, to hinder his pa&s;&s;age, and interrupt his Journey, fearing that things beginning now to compo&s;e, the Turks ap|pea&s;ed for the former di&s;orders, and the minds of the <HI>Jews</HI> in &s;ome manner &s;etled, might be mo|ved, and combu&s;tions bur&s;t out afre&s;h by the appearance of this new Impo&s;tor, and therefore di&s;patched this Letter as followeth.</P>

Prov.</NOTE> for the feet of man always guide him to the wor&s;t. <HI>Wherefore, we underwritten, do adverti&s;e you, that this Man coming within the Compa&s;s of your Ju|ri&s;diction, you give a &s;top to his Journey, and not &s;uffer him to proceed farther, but pre&s;ent|ly to return back. For we would have you know, That at his Coming he will begin again to move tho&s;e tumults, which have been cau&s;ed through Dreams of a new Kingdom,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arab. Prov.</NOTE> And that miracles are not wrought every day. God forbid, that by his Coming, the People of God &s;hould be de&s;troyed in all places where they are, of which he will be the fir&s;t, who&s;e blood be upon his own head; for in this Con|juncture every little errour or fault is made Capital; you may remember the danger of the fir&s;t Combu&s;tion, and it is very probable, that he will be an occa&s;ion of greater, which the Tongue is not able to expre&s;s with words. And therefore, by virtue of ours, and your own Au|thority, you are to hinder him from proceed|ing farther in his journey, upon pain of all tho&s;e Excommunications, which our Law can impo&s;e, and to force him to return back again, both he and his Company. But if he &s;hall in any manner oppo&s;e you, and rebel again&s;t your word, your Endeavours and Law are &s;ufficient to hinder him, for it will be well for him, and for all <HI>I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P>For the love of God, let the&s;e words enter into your ears, &s;ince they are not vain things, for the lives of all the <HI>Jews,</HI> and his al&s;o con|&s;i&s;t therein. And the Lord God behold from Heaven, and have pity upon his People <HI>I&s;rael. Amen.</HI> So be his holy will written by tho&s;e who &s;eek your Peace.</P>

<P>By the&s;e means <HI>Nathan</HI> being di&s;appointed of his wandring progre&s;s, and partly a&s;hamed of the E|vents contrary to his Prophecies, was re&s;olved, without entring <HI>Smyrna,</HI> to depart thence; how&s;o|ever he obtained leave to vi&s;it the Sepulchre of his Mother, and there to receive pardon of his &s;ins (ac|cording to the in&s;titution of <HI>Sabatai</HI> before menti|oned;) but fir&s;t wa&s;hed him&s;elf in the Sea, in man|ner of purification, and &s;aid his <HI>Tevila,</HI> or Prayers, at the Fountain, called by us the Fountain of <HI>Santa Ve|neranda,</HI> which is near the Coemetery of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and then departed for <HI>Xio</HI> with two Companions, a Servant and three <HI>Turks</HI> to conduct him, without admitting the Legates to audience, or an&s;wering the Letter which was &s;ent him from all the Com|munities of the <HI>Jews</HI> in <HI>Italy.</HI> And thus the Emba&s;|&s;ie of the&s;e Legates was concluded, and they return|ed from the place to whence they came, and the <HI>Jews</HI> again to their Wits, following their Trade and Profe&s;&s;ion of Brokage, as formerly, with more quiet and advantage than the means of regaining their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the Land of Promi&s;e And thus ended this mad phren&s;ie among&s;t the <HI>Jews,</HI> which might have co&s;t them dear, had not <HI>Sabatai</HI> renounced his Me&s;&s;iah&s;hip at the Feet of <HI>Mahomet.</HI> The&s;e mat|ters were tran&s;acted in the Years 1665 and 1666; &s;ince which <HI>Sabatai</HI> hath pa&s;&s;ed his time devoutly in the <HI>Ottomon</HI> Court, educated at the Feet of the learned <HI>Gamaliel</HI> of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Law, <HI>(viz) Vanni</HI> Effendi, Preacher to the Seraglio, or as we may &s;o term him, Chaplain to the Sultan, one &s;o literate as to be e&s;teemed the Grand Oracle of their Reli|gion; &s;o preci&s;e, and conceited of his own Sancti|ty as a Phari&s;ee, and &s;o &s;uper&s;titious, that nothing &s;eemed more to unhallow his Wor&s;hip than the touch or approach of a Chri&s;tian.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cour&s;e of life which <HI>Sabatai</HI> led after he turned Mahome|tan.</NOTE> To this Ma&s;ter, <HI>Sabatai</HI> was a mo&s;t docil Scholar, and pro|fited, as we may imagine, beyond mea&s;ure in the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Doctrine; &s;o that in exchange of &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions <HI>Vanni</HI> thought it no di&s;parage|ment, from &s;o great a Rabbin as his new Di&s;ci|ple, to learn &s;omething of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Rites, and rectifie tho&s;e crude Notions he had conceived of the <HI>Mo&s;aical</HI> Law. In this manner <HI>Sabati</HI> pa&s;&s;ed his days in the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Court, as &s;ome time <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> did in that of the <HI>Egyptians;</HI> and perhaps in imi|tation of him, ca&s;t his eyes often on the Afflicti|ons of his Brethren, of whom, during his life, he continued to profe&s;s him&s;elf a Deliverer, but with that care and caution of giving &s;candal to the <HI>Turks,</HI> that he declared, Unle&s;s their Nation be|came like him, that is, renounce the Shadows, and imperfect Elements of the <HI>Mo&s;aical</HI> Law, which will be compleated by adherence to the <HI>Mahometan,</HI> and &s;uch other Additions as his in&s;pi|red Wi&s;dom &s;hould &s;ugge&s;t, he &s;hould never be able to prevail with God for them, or conduct them to the Holy Land of their Forefathers. Here|upon many <HI>Jews</HI> flocked in, &s;ome as far as from <HI>Babylon, Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and other remote places, and ca&s;ting their Caps on the ground, in pre&s;ence of the Grand Signior, voluntarily profe&s;&s;ed them|&s;elves <HI>Mahometans. Sabatai</HI> him&s;elf by the&s;e Pro&s;e|lytes gaining ground in the e&s;teem of the <HI>Turks,</HI> had priviledg granted him to vi&s;it familiarly his Brethren, which he employed in Circumci&s;ing their Children the Eighth day, according to the Precept of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> preaching his new Doctrines, by which he hath confirmed many in their Faith of his being the Me&s;&s;iah, and &s;tartled all with ex|pectation of what the&s;e &s;trange ways of Enthu|&s;ia&s;m may produce; but none dur&s;t publickly own him, le&s;t they &s;hould di&s;plea&s;e the <HI>Turks,</HI> and the <HI>Jews,</HI> and incur the danger of Excommuni|cation from one, and the Gallows from the other.</P>
<P>How&s;oever in <HI>January</HI> 1671/2 appeared another bold Impo&s;tor among&s;t the <HI>Jews</HI> in <HI>Smyrna</HI> from the <HI>Morea,</HI> as it was &s;aid, or not known from whence, who in de&s;pight of <HI>Sabatai,</HI> and his own Gover|nours, pretended to be Me&s;&s;iah; but with &s;o incon|&s;iderable and petty a Deluder as this, the <HI>Jews</HI> thought to make quick work; but being a&s;hamed at fir&s;t to bring another Me&s;&s;iah on the Stage, by help of money they accu&s;ed him of Adultery, and procured a Sentence from the Kadi, condemn|ing him to the Gallies; in order unto which, and in proof of his good behaviour he remain'd &s;ome time in Pri&s;on, in which Interim he found means to clear him&s;elf of that Crime by open evidence to the contrary, and had for the pre&s;ent e&s;caped out of the power of the Synagogue, had not their Authority &amp; money prevailed more than the Friends or Di&s;ciples of this Impo&s;tor; whom we will leave in pri&s;on, and <HI>Sabatai</HI> in the hou&s;e of <HI>Pharaoh;</HI> where he continued until the Year 1676, and then died. And &s;o we return to more important matters of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Affairs.</P>
<P>Since that we have &s;o long in&s;i&s;ted on the phren&s;ie of the <HI>Jews,</HI> let us return to matters of greater con&s;e|quence, and more general concernment; &amp; look back to Count <HI>Le&s;lie</HI> the Emperors Amba&s;&s;ador, who ha|ving departed from <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> the 11^t^h of <HI>Decemb.</HI> of the la&s;t Year, we find on the 10th of <HI>March</HI> of this year on the Frontiers ready to make exchange with the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador. The night before, Count <HI>Le&s;lie</HI> was lodged at a Village called <HI>Elmas,</HI> where the Inhabitants, as in the mo&s;t parts of upper <HI>Hun|gary,</HI> are Calvini&s;ts in Religion; and though the live between two Swords,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The manner of ex|change of the Em|perors and <HI>Turks</HI> Am|ba&s;&s;adour.</NOTE> do yet in time of War, by paying a Tribute to both Parties, and providing Forage for both, remain more &s;ecure than in the Villages &s;ubjected to either; which are of|ten burnt, or in &s;ome other manner mi&s;erably de|&s;troyed. The next day the Emperors Amba&s;&s;ador, conducted by the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Quinque Eccle&s;iae,</HI> with a|bout three hundred Hor&s;e, arrived at the place for many years ob&s;erved for exchange of Amba&s;&s;adors, which is about an hour and halfs Journey, or five miles (as we may &s;o &s;ay) di&s;tant from this Village, where in open Fields upon the Brink of the <HI>Danube,</HI> are &s;et three Po&s;ts; the two Amba&s;&s;adors meeting at that in the middle, after &s;ome Complements, take their leaves each of other, and &s;o exchange. The <HI>Ger|man</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador that day arrived near his Po&s;t a|bout &s;even a Clock in the morning, but the <HI>Turki&s;h,</HI> not being as yet come from <HI>Komara,</HI> he could not proceed farther. After &s;ome expectation here, advice came, That the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador was re&s;olved not to depart from <HI>Komara</HI> until he was &s;atisfied for the allowance of eighteen days, at a hundred Dol|lars for every day, which he had &s;pent at his entrance into <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> between the frontiers and the City of <HI>Vienna.</HI> But to this was replied, That it had never been the cu&s;tom to allow the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Am|ba&s;&s;ador mony for his daily provi&s;ions, until he en|tred the Emperors Court; and in the mean time the expences and charge of his journey were to be de|frayed by the Imperial Officers, who had performed the &s;ame in a mo&s;t ample and plentiful manner: But the <HI>Turk</HI> was re&s;olved not to be &s;o &s;atisfied, and therefore declared he would not depart without full payment; hoping the more ea&s;ily to prevail, in regard the <HI>German</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador was already in the Field, expo&s;ed to the cold and &s;harp weather, with|out provi&s;ions either for him&s;elf, Attendance, or Hor&s;es, whil&s;t the <HI>Turk</HI> remained warm in his Boat, accommodated with his Stove, and wrapt in his Furs, &s;o that he hoped there might be a nece&s;&s;ity of granting what he re&s;erved for the rear-guard of his preten&s;ions. The matter &s;eemed unrea&s;onable to the <HI>German</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, as al&s;o to the <HI>Turks</HI> that attended him, who being in the open and cold Air, judg'd it in an un&s;eemly time to capitulate. But in fine, the <HI>German</HI>
<PB N="185" REF="96">gave him this An&s;wer. That an Amba&s;&s;ador ought to be contented with that ho&s;pitality and entertain|ment which was accu&s;tomary, as he him&s;elf had done; for that &s;ince his departure from <HI>Buda,</HI> which was then &s;even days, he had not receiv'd one A&s;per of allowance, re&s;ting &s;atisfied with the Pa&s;ha's word, that from <HI>Buda</HI> homewards it was not accu&s;tomary to receive a farther treatment; &s;o that if he in&s;i&s;ted on the fir&s;t, he was to be allowed the latter, &s;ince both Amba&s;&s;adours are to be u&s;ed with terms of equality; and therefore to find an expedient to give him &s;atisfaction, he was contented re&s;ign his &s;even days allow|ance from the Grand Signior; and if any thing farther was really owing he would engage his parole of honour for the payment. And farther he added. That none but a corrupt Mini&s;ter would make his private Intere&s;t to &s;tand in Competition with a publick De&s;ign, and make the pretence of a few Dollars an interruption and impediment to the progree&s;s of the great Af|fairs of the Two Empires, profe&s;&s;ing that he would have quitted all his right, rather than the lea&s;t concernment of his Ma&s;ter &s;hould have received a prejudice, on confidence of who&s;e gracious favour he depended for reparation of what&s;oever he &s;uffered for his &s;ervice. He thanked God that he had happily managed his Emba&s;&s;y to the &s;atisfaction of the Grand Signior, and the appro|bation of his Ma&s;ter, and was now ready to per|form the la&s;t office and ceremony, in which if he did fail, or was impeded, the fault was not his, be|ing ready to return to <HI>Buda,</HI> &s;o the other in like manner did to <HI>Vienna,</HI> there to remain until this difference was decided by their Ma&s;ters. The Turki&s;h Amba&s;&s;adour's Kahya or Steward who was pre&s;ent, and heard all this di&s;cour&s;e, &s;ee|ming not plea&s;ed to hear of a return to <HI>Vienna,</HI> immediately replied, That he conceived his Ma|&s;ter would not remove from <HI>Komara;</HI> to which it was an&s;wered, That a man who &s;o little under&s;tood the office of an Amba&s;&s;adour, as it appeared his Ma&s;ter did, was to be treated with &s;ome other kind of &s;tile than was agreeable to the re&s;pect due to a publick Mini&s;ter, and &s;hould therefore be forced to it in ca&s;e he &s;hould refu&s;e. The Tur|ki&s;h Amba&s;&s;adour having his &s;tomach &s;omething taken down with the threats of returning to <HI>Vienna,</HI> that afternoon loo&s;ed from <HI>Komara,</HI> and between three and four a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> arrived at the place of Exchange; but the wind blowing hard, had put &s;ome of his Boats a&s;hore, which were mo&s;t laden; and fewe&s;t men to govern them, which afforded him occa&s;ion of farther delay, pre|tending that his Goods might be arre&s;ted at <HI>Ko|mara,</HI> and until he was &s;atisfied to the contrary, he was re&s;olved not to make the Exchange. The German Amba&s;&s;adour was more moved with choler at this humor than at the former; and the Turks that attended, growing more hungry and more cold, be&s;towed on him a million of cur|&s;es. The Sun now declining towards its &s;etting, Count <HI>Le&s;lie</HI> &s;ent word to the Turk, That he was re&s;olved not longer to abu&s;e his own patience, but immediately to proceed forward, giving or|der to his Coach to drive on, prote&s;ting, That if any mi&s;chief was derived from this irregular pro|ceeding, the fault was not his, nor would he an|&s;wer for any of tho&s;e fatal con&s;equences which might en&s;ue; to which al&s;o being added &s;ome per|&s;wa&s;ions of the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Quin&abque; Eccle&s;iae,</HI> the Turk at length came out from his Boat and went to his Po&s;t. The Turks were drawn up on their own Quarter to the number of about three hun|dred, and the Hungarian Hu&s;&s;ars or Hor&s;e-men on the other to about two hundred; the two Amba&s;&s;adours making a &s;tand at their re&s;pective Poles, proceeded with equal paces to meet in the middle, where &s;ome few Complements having pa&s;&s;ed between them, and Salutes interchangeably &s;ent to the chief Mini&s;ters of each Empire, the German Amba&s;&s;adour entred his Coach, and the Turk his Boat, and &s;o both returned to their re&s;pective Courts. Such as was the &s;ordid and intere&s;&s;ed humour of the Turki&s;h Amba&s;&s;adour in this tran&s;action, &s;o no le&s;s di&s;honourable was his way of living at <HI>Vienna,</HI> where he &s;o journed with that mi&s;erable famine and penury in his hou&s;e, as di&s;contented all his family, cau&s;ing &s;ome to leave him and return home; others with bet|ter motives (as it is hoped) to the number of thirty became Chri&s;tians, and imbraced the Faith; at the &s;ame rate he was generous in his Pre&s;ents: for to the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e where he lodged he gave two five-Senars or eighteen Pence Engli&s;h, and to the Commi&s;&s;ary who conducted him to the Frontiers, he pre&s;ented a Bag of Rice, which was not accepted but returned with the like comple|ment, as that with which it was tendered.</P>
<P>But no &s;ooner was this Peace concluded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Turks meditate a new War.</NOTE> and the Ceremonies thereof thus happily fini&s;hed, but the Turks, attentive to another War, which is the life of their Empire, and their only &s;ecurity again&s;t inte&s;tine Di&s;cords, made all the Prepa|rations and Provi&s;ions this Year, that were po&s;|&s;ible, for the total &s;ubjection of <HI>Candia,</HI> of which this Vizier was highly ambitious, de&s;igning there|by to gain unto him&s;elf that renown of which his Predece&s;&s;ours had been in pur&s;uit for the &s;pace of twenty five years; &s;o that all Ammunition, Vi|ctual, and what&s;oever was nece&s;&s;ary, was in great quantities &s;upplied from all the circumjacent parts of the Empire.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Candia</HI> was &s;ome time before go|verned by the Proveditor <HI>Priuli;</HI> but afterwards the Venetians, apprehen&s;ive of the &s;ucceeding War, conferred the Charge on Marque&s;s <HI>Villa,</HI> a worthy and experienced Souldier, with Title of General of the Venetian Infantry, as we have before intimated; and having left him and his Forces in the month of <HI>December</HI> la&s;t, on the I&s;land of <HI>Paros;</HI> where having, as is &s;aid, mu|&s;tered his Forces, he imbarked them on &s;ixteen Gallies, five Gallea&s;&s;es, and thirty five Men of War; with which &s;ailing in company from <HI>Anti-Paros,</HI> the whole Fleet on the <HI>12th</HI> of <HI>February</HI> made their Rendezvous at <HI>Argentiera;</HI> during which time the Turks landed eighteen hundred Jani&s;aries at <HI>Canea,</HI> being tran&s;ported thither on thirty five Gallies, which having incountred with the Cavalier <HI>Hoquincourt</HI> in the channel of <HI>Scio,</HI> received &s;ome damage and lo&s;s of men in their way, though this Cavalier him&s;elf was wounded in the Engagement, and forty of his men &s;lain. The Venetian Fleet departing from <HI>Argentiera</HI> on the <HI>23th</HI> of <HI>February,</HI> came in &s;ight of <HI>Candia,</HI> when a very great &s;torm ari&s;ing with Thunder and Lightning, put the whole fleet in danger of &s;hipwrack; but by Gods Providence, though to&s;&s;ed with contrary winds, they arrived on the <HI>26th</HI> in &s;afety in the Port of <HI>Suda,</HI> being directed thither in a dark night, by tho&s;e Lights which the Fortre&s;s had put abroad, though the Turks on the other &s;ide had put out fal&s;e Fires to de|ceive them. The Army being landed at this place, and a Mu&s;ter made of the Forces, Pay was given to the Souldiery; with which being be|come the more couragious, they marched towards <HI>Canea,</HI> with hopes to perform &s;ome memora|ble Enterpri&s;e at that place. The Lieutenant-General <HI>Vuer&s;miller</HI> led the Van,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An En|gagement near <HI>Co|nea.</HI></NOTE> con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ix|hundred Foot, and an hundred and eighty Hor&s;e,
<PB N="186" REF="97">and advancing beyond tho&s;e bounds which Marque&s;s <HI>Villa</HI> had pre&s;cribed him, was incountred by a more numerous Force from the Garri&s;on, by which being at fir&s;t put into &s;ome di&s;order, had been intirely defeated, had not the Mar|que&s;s opportunely arrived to his Succour: how&s;oe|ver the Venetians lo&s;t in this Skirmi&s;h three hun|dred Souldiers, forty Hor&s;e, and twelve Offi|cers, among&s;t which the Murque&s;s <HI>Ceva</HI> was &s;lain upon the place, and Captain <HI>Scot</HI> a Scoth man taken Pri&s;oner, whom the Engli&s;h Factory re|deemed at <HI>Smyrna;</HI> of the Turks &s;even hundred were computed to have been killed, with the A|ga of the Jani&s;aries, a &s;tout and a well experien|ced Souldier. And as this beginning was not very au&s;picious to the Chri&s;tians, &s;o neither did the Heavens &s;eem much to favour them; for an unu&s;ual rain with few fair days continued almo&s;t for the &s;pace of three months, which filled all Rivers, Mar&s;hes, and Ditches with &s;o &s;trange an inunda|tion, that the Army beginning to want Forage for the Hor&s;es, and all other Provi&s;ions for their Men; and the Garri&s;on of <HI>Canea</HI> being reinforced from <HI>Retimo, Chiramo, Armiro,</HI> and other places, di&s;couraged the Commanders in that manner, that they thought it more convenient to retire and incamp in the plea&s;ant and fruitful Vallies of <HI>Spina Longa,</HI> until better weather, and other Recruits of their Army &s;hould open a way either to make another Attempt on <HI>Canea,</HI> or new <HI>Candia.</HI> But Fortune did not favour the&s;e de|&s;igns; for the Captain-general <HI>Andrea Cornaro</HI> arriving with his Fleet, part at <HI>Candia,</HI> and part at <HI>Standia,</HI> (which is an I&s;land or Rock about two Leagues di&s;tant from this City) a new re&s;olution was taken to remain on the defen&s;ive part, and to attend wholly to the guard of the City: for as in the natural body, upon it is a&s;&s;aulted by a|cute and hot humors, the &s;pirits retire to the heart to comfort and &s;ecure that from the violence of the di&s;temper; &s;o the Venetians perceiving that their Enemies daily grew more numerous, re|&s;olved to contract their Force into one Body for defence of that City, which was the heart or the mo&s;t principal in&s;trument of life in that I&s;land: Wherefore Recruits both of Men, Am|munition, and Provi&s;ions were daily &s;ent thi|ther; and the Captain of the Gulf arriving at <HI>Suda</HI> with eleven Gallies and one Gallea&s;s, carrying fifteen hundred Soldiers, with three hundred Pioniere, joyned his Forces to the Body of the Fleet; and all imbarking in divers Squadrons, made ha&s;te to land their men in the City of <HI>Can|dia</HI> with all po&s;&s;ible expedition.</P>

The Captain-General by this time arriving with the remainder of the Militia, a general Mu&s;ter was made in the Trenches of the Fort <HI>Panigra;</HI> of which the Turks having advice, fell unex|pectedly upon them with a &s;trong Body; the Chri|&s;tians being &s;urpri&s;ed hereat; and <HI>Ver&s;ama</HI> a va|liant Collonel being &s;lain, they began &s;hamefully to run, nor could either the Bravery of the Mar|que&s;s or his Authority &s;top their flight; how&s;oe|ver the Musket-&s;hot and great great Guns from the Walls were &s;o plentifully be&s;towed on the Turks, that few of tho&s;e who were over-&s;orward in the purfuit, returned to their Companions.</P>
<P>On the <HI>12th</HI> of <HI>April</HI> a Fleet of Gallies arrived with new Recruits, with which the Chri&s;ti|ans being reinforced, Marque&s;s <HI>Villa</HI> re&s;olved to take the Field; &s;o that marching out of the City by night with &s;even thou&s;and Foot and &s;ix hundred and fifty Hor&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ventians in|camp.</NOTE> he incamped between that and the Valley of the River <HI>Gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ffiro,</HI> draw|ing his Trenches ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to the the Enemies Camp; in the mean Time two Squadrons of Ships were &s;ent abroad, one towards the <HI>Cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ciere,</HI> and the other towards the Coa&s;t of <HI>Canea,</HI> to intercept and hinder &s;uch Succours as might be &s;ent to the Enemies Camp.

<P>About this time advice being come to the Captain-General, That the <HI>Turks</HI> were di&s;pee|ding fifty Gallies laden with Men and Am|munition, he re&s;olved to incounter them at Sea with four Gallea&s;&s;es, and twenty Gallies, reinforcing his Fleet with twelve hundred men, which he took from the Camp; which being thereby con&s;iderably dimini&s;hed, as al&s;o by the late Engagements: yet Marque&s;s <HI>Villa</HI> kept his ground, but contracted the compa&s;s of his Trenches, and rai&s;ed a Fort in &s;ight of the Enemy, who had not the courage to give him the lea&s;t interruption; but rather after this example fortified their own Tren|ches, &s;hutting all Avenues or pa&s;&s;ages to Re|negadoes, whom they &s;u&s;pected might fly, and give advice to the Chri&s;tians: how&s;oever &s;ome of them e&s;caped to the <HI>Venetian</HI> Camp, de|claring that the Cannon from the Town did much incommode the <HI>Turks</HI> in their Trenches; upon which Intelligence Marque&s;s <HI>Villa</HI> order|ed forty eight &s;hot to be made at that place, where they were mo&s;t offended, which put the <HI>Turks</HI> into great con&s;ternation: after which no con&s;iderable Engagements happened, be|&s;ides &s;ome few Skirmi&s;hes and Rencounters of no memorable note, in which one <HI>Antiquario</HI> a Quarter-ma&s;ter, Count <HI>Pio Ferretti,</HI> and o|thers &s;ignalized them&s;elves by particular Acts of Valour, as al&s;o Captain <HI>Vimes</HI> who killed <HI>Mehmet Bey,</HI> a <HI>Turk</HI> of great e&s;teem, with his own hand.</P>
<P>But now the <HI>Turks</HI> receiving daily Recruits, as of eight hundred Janizaries, and &s;ix hun|dred Spahees, landed at <HI>Gira-petra,</HI> and &s;even|teen hundred more disbarked at <HI>Chi&s;&s;amo;</HI> and advices daily coming of great numbers of Ga|leots and Brigantines providing in the Gulf of <HI>Lepanto,</HI> and of eighteen Ships of <HI>Barbary,</HI> all ready to tran&s;port Soldiers to <HI>Candia,</HI> moved the Captain-General to per&s;wade the removal of the Camp for better &s;ecurity of the mo&s;t important places:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Vene|tian</HI> Camp rai&s;ed.</NOTE> the which Marque&s;s <HI>Villa</HI> performed accordingly in the night preceding the fir&s;t of <HI>June,</HI> with much order and care; for fir&s;t he cau&s;ed the Artillery to be with|drawn, with the Mortar-pieces, Ammunition, and Provi&s;ions of War, and placed in the Fort of <HI>Mocenigo;</HI> then he cau&s;ed half the Army to work in filling the Trenches, whil&s;t the other half remained in form of Battel, and two hours before day blew up the Fort; which having done, they marched in three Bo|dies to the City, to the great joy and &s;atisfacti|on of the <HI>Turks,</HI> who on that occa&s;ion made a day of Fe&s;tival.</P>
<P>The&s;e particulars of Action having pa&s;&s;ed un|der the Conduct of Marque&s;s <HI>Villa</HI> without any &s;ignal Victory or advantage over the <HI>Turk,</HI> ad|mini&s;tred &s;ubject to &s;uch who in the parts of Chri&s;tendom were emulous of his glory, and envious of his eminent charge, to give liberty to their tongues to di&s;parage the management of his Affairs, as not agreeable to that high expectation of &s;ucce&s;s which the World con|ceived thereof, when he fir&s;t entred on this im|ployment: But here it is ob&s;ervable at what rate men who lye &s;oft and warm in their beds at home, unconcerned in the dangers, labours, and hazards of tho&s;e who live and act abroad, can make their reflexions, and pa&s;s their cen&s;ures on active and ingaged men, not con&s;idering the &s;tate of affairs, the uncertain|ty of Succours in &s;o long and di&s;tant a tract of Sea, as pa&s;&s;es between <HI>Venice</HI> and <HI>Candia,</HI> &s;ubjected to Winds, and a thou&s;and Ca&s;ualties; nor yet the numerous Troops of the Enemy, nor the Pui&s;&s;ance of that Empire, which for its Power, Riche&s;s, and the Valour of its Sol|diery, may be e&s;teemed the mo&s;t Potent and con&s;iderable of all the Monarchies and known Kingdoms of the Univer&s;e. But what conje|ctures &s;oever envious men might make of the Conduct of Marque&s;s <HI>Villa,</HI> yet the Senate of <HI>Venice</HI> applauded his labours, and owned his &s;ervices, as being &s;uch, which having merited the admiration and e&s;teem of all the World, did in a particular manner challenge their thankfulne&s;s and acknowledgments. About this time the Gallies of <HI>Malta</HI> arrived at <HI>Candia,</HI> where &s;ome di&s;pute ari&s;ing touching the place of precedence in the Fleet, which the <HI>Venetians</HI> denied to them: they departed thence with &s;ome di&s;&s;atisfaction, and returned to the We&s;tward to tran&s;port the young Empre&s;s out of <HI>Spain</HI> into <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>And now intelligence coming to <HI>Candia</HI> by divers Letters, that the Great Vizier was de|parted from <HI>Adrinaople</HI> with a numerous Ar|my, and was already arrived at <HI>Thebes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Great Vizier ar|rives at <HI>Thebes.</HI></NOTE> where a general Rendezvous was appointed of the whole Army, with re&s;olution to be tran&s;ported from <HI>Malvoi&s;in</HI> to that I&s;land; the <HI>Venetian</HI> Generals and Commanders in chief concluded in nece&s;&s;ary, if po&s;&s;ible, to hinder their pa&s;&s;age, and rather to fight them at Sea, which was their more propitious Element, than to attend their Landing, where they would be forced to di&s;pute with unequal numbers, and on di&s;ad|vantageous terms. Accordingly the Captain-General reinforced his Fleet with two thou|&s;and Foot, and a thou&s;and Hor&s;e under the Command of Count <HI>Licinio Martinoni,</HI> appoin|ting the Rendezvous to be at <HI>Argentiera,</HI> to which place al&s;o Marque&s;s <HI>Villa</HI> repaired, touch|ing by the way at <HI>Milo</HI> for refre&s;hment of his Hor&s;e, it being an I&s;land abounding with Her|bage; the Captain General being for &s;ome days detained at <HI>Standia</HI> by contrary Winds, a Con&s;ultation was held for the more advantage|ous management of the War; after which the whole Fleet making Sail, was on <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> the ninth &s;cattered by a furious &s;torm, and not being able to recover <HI>Santoxini,</HI> they by good fortune &s;etched <HI>Stampalia,</HI> an I&s;land abound|ing with generous Wines, excellent Fruit, Par|tridges, and other Provi&s;ions; at length after various fortunes arriving at <HI>Andra,</HI> which is a great and populous I&s;land, another Council of War was held, where it was again concluded, That all care was to be taken to intercept the Succours which the Enemy daily &s;ent to <HI>Can|dia;</HI> to which end the Cavalier <HI>Grimani,</HI> Cap|tain of the Galleons, was ordered to crui&s;e about the Coa&s;t; and hearing that twelve <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Ships were lading Provi&s;ions in the Gulf
<PB N="188" REF="98">of <HI>Volo,</HI> he repaired thither, and had the good fortune to take them with all their lading;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Twelve <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;els ta|ken.</NOTE> but the other Squadrons mi&s;&s;ed of the like &s;ucce&s;s; for notwith&s;tanding the care and vigilance which was u&s;ed, all matters &s;eemed to &s;ucceed pro&s;|perous for the <HI>Turks,</HI> and adver&s;e to the Chri&s;ti|ans; the de&s;igns of the fir&s;t having an i&s;&s;ue a|greeable to their intentions, whil&s;t tho&s;e of the latter were always di&s;appointed either by Na|ture or by Fortune, or rather by that &s;ecret hand of Providence, which had allotted that I&s;land for a Prize to the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Arms.</P>
<P>By this time the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Army being at their Rendezvous at <HI>Thebes,</HI> the Great Vizier prepa|red to imbark; and con&s;idering the difficulty of the pa&s;&s;age, thought it prudent fir&s;t to make new Propo&s;itions to Signior <HI>Ballarino</HI> before he entred on this hazardous attempt, &s;uppo&s;ing perhaps, that the rumour of this March might have affrighted the <HI>Venetians</HI> to a Surrender of that Kingdom, that they might &s;pare the blood and charge of that War which afterwards en|&s;ued: Wherefore <HI>Ballarino</HI> being called from his Hou&s;e at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> began his Journey towards <HI>Thebes</HI> on the twentyfifth of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> accompanied by a Capugiba&s;hee, and three Janizaries: and in twenty three days arriving at <HI>The&s;&s;alonica,</HI> now called <HI>Salonica,</HI> he fell &s;ick of a violent Feaver, cau&s;ed by that agitation of body in his Travels to which he was un|accu&s;tomed, and for want of that &s;leep which he u&s;ed to take after his &s;lender dinner, pa&s;&s;ing the re&s;t of the day and night in continual watchings: at fir&s;t he felt only &s;ome little al|terations, which he hoping might pa&s;s over, re&s;olved to proceed on his Journey notwith|&s;tanding the per&s;wa&s;ions to the contrary of Signior <HI>Patavino</HI> his Secretary, with whom I was well acquainted, and ever e&s;teemed for an hone&s;t and a worthy Per&s;on: but he con|tinued re&s;olute to proceed, fearing le&s;t his de|lays by the way &s;hould lo&s;e him the oppor|tunity of that moment of Treaty, which was impo&s;&s;ible afterward to be retrieved; for in his Journey he would often rea&s;on in this manner: If I &s;hould &s;top here, what cen&s;ure would the World pa&s;s on me? I may po&s;&s;ibly excu&s;e my &s;elf; but in the mean time the Vizier may in|gage too far in his de&s;ign, and fru&s;trate all tho&s;e methods and foundations which I have laid towards a Peace: and then if I live, I &s;hall be over-burdened with the reproaches of the World, for having abandoned the grand in|cumbance in its ultimate nece&s;&s;ity, which is charged upon me, which will be a more &s;en&s;ible affliction than the agony of death. My &s;ickne&s;s will be e&s;teemed by many to be rather di&s;&s;em|bled than real. The dead man lives in the memory of his faithfulne&s;s and con&s;tancy, and the living man dies in the indelible characters of his cowardi&s;e and misfortune. The&s;e were his own words.</P>
<P>And thus travelling forward his Feaver dai|ly increa&s;ed to that exce&s;s, that on the &s;ixth day he was forced to &s;top at a City called <HI>I&s;dino,</HI> where having in&s;tructed Signior <HI>Pata|vino</HI> in what manner he ought to manage af|fairs, and recommending his &s;ervices and chil|dren to the favour and protection of the Senate, he pa&s;&s;ed to the other World, being honoured by a &s;olemn Funeral at the publick Expence, and Interred in the Church of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> his Son <HI>Domenico Ballarino</HI> &s;ucceeding into the Of|fice and Inheritance of his Father. The Senate under&s;tanding by advices from Signior <HI>Pada|vino.</HI> That the Vizier de&s;ired another Envoy, qualified with the Character of a publick Mini|&s;ter to re&s;ide with him in <HI>Candia,</HI> di&s;patched the Secretary <HI>Girolamo Giavarina,</HI> a Per&s;on of good abilities, to that place. And at the &s;ame time the Captain-General <HI>Andrea Cornaro</HI> pre&s;&s;ing the Senate for licen&s;e to return to his own Coun|try; his reque&s;t was granted, and <HI>France&s;co Mo|ro&s;ini</HI> was appointed to &s;ucceed him in that im|portant Charge, and was accompanied at a time of &s;o great emergency with powerful Convoys, and with Recruits of Men, Provi&s;ions, and Am|munition fitting to carry on &s;o pre&s;&s;ing a War.</P>
<P>On the Month of <HI>October</HI> the Great Vizier in per&s;on imbarking him&s;elf and Army at <HI>Malvoi&s;ia</HI> with many Pa&s;ha's,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Vi|zier pa&s;&s;es over into <HI>Candia.</HI></NOTE> and men expert and active in the War, pa&s;&s;ed over to the I&s;le of <HI>Candia,</HI> re|&s;olving by &s;trength and dint of Sword to force that &s;trong City to obedience the main Bul|wark of Chri&s;tendom, &s;ituated at the Entrance of the <HI>Archipelago;</HI> of the &s;ucce&s;s of which fa|mous Siege we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to di&s;cour&s;e more at large and more particularly hereafter; in order unto which the Great Vizier on the la&s;t day of this Year, went in Per&s;on to take a view of this City, and having &s;urveyed all &s;ides of it, apprehended that the Siege would be long and tedious; and therefore returned again to <HI>Canea</HI> to take tho&s;e mea&s;ures which were requi&s;ite for an Enterpri&s;e of that weight and con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Princes of Chri&s;tendom being for the mo&s;t part either in that di&s;cord a|mong&s;t them&s;elves, of which the <HI>Turks</HI> have al|ways made their advantage; or el&s;e living in parts remote, did not con&s;ider <HI>Candia</HI> as a Pulwaik to their Dominions, and therefore rendred little other a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the <HI>Venetians</HI> than good words, and vain wi&s;hes for their &s;ucce&s;s and Victory. The Popes Forces only under Command of <HI>Muzeo Mattei</HI> which were in <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> were tran&s;ported to <HI>Candia,</HI> and five hundred Foot belonging to the Grand Duke of <HI>To&s;cany,</HI> came into their places for de&s;ence of that Country. The mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King in return to the Emba&s;&s;y of <HI>Venice</HI> performed by the Cavalier <HI>Alvi&s;e Sagre|do,</HI> remitted to that Republick an hundred thou|&s;and Crowns, and Cardinal <HI>Barberini</HI> at his ex|pence &s;upplied four thou&s;and Mea&s;ures of Corn. But the pre&s;ent Conjuncture did not &s;eem to &s;mile on the <HI>Venetians,</HI> for all the Gallies belonging to <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> as well as tho&s;e of <HI>Malta,</HI> were employed in the Tran&s;portation of the new Em|pre&s;s <HI>Margerita</HI> of <HI>Au&s;tria.</HI> The Pope was in|firm, and di&s;tracted with his own Dome&s;tick Af|fairs. The Emperor was a young Bridegroom, and be&s;ides the Diver&s;ion which a Wife gave him from Cares, he apprehended that he might &s;peedi|ly receive &s;ome di&s;turbance from the Princes of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and from <HI>Sweden</HI> in the Dukedom of <HI>Bremen.</HI> The King of <HI>Spain</HI> was a Child of five years old, labouring at the &s;ame time under a War with <HI>Portugal,</HI> and threatned by the more powerful Arms of <HI>France,</HI> on the pretence of <HI>Flan|ders:</HI> Be&s;ides all which, the <HI>Turks</HI> were as well in quietne&s;s among&s;t them&s;elves, as they were at peace with all other Princes; &s;o that we may ex|pect that the force and power of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Em|pire &s;hould now be turned, like a Torrent, to overwhelm this &s;pot of Land, which &s;eemed to be &s;o &s;ituated, as well to re&s;i&s;t the Waves of the Seas, as the Inundation of this mighty and Mar|tial People.</P>

<P>AT the Beginning of this year the Winter and Cold which chilled and benumbed the Earth, encrea&s;ed the heat, and gave vigour and action to the Tartars, who made &s;uch an unex|pected incur&s;ion into <HI>Poland,</HI> that they carried with them near a hundred thou&s;and captived Souls, as they were numbred before <HI>Ja&s;h,</HI> in their return home. The Polanders, awakened hereat, but ill advi&s;ed, re&s;olved on a Treaty where there was more ju&s;t cau&s;e for an open War, and in order thereunto di&s;peeded an Amba&s;&s;adour to the Sul|tan, to expo&s;tulate the rea&s;on of this breach of Peace, and require ju&s;tice and &s;atisfaction on tho&s;e his Subjects, who had, contrary to the Ar|ticles of Peace., committed &s;uch actions, and outrages of open ho&s;tility; or at lea&s;t, that the Turk would not take upon him to abet the cau&s;e of the Tartars, whil&s;t the olanders took ju&s;t revenge for their late injuries. The Am|ba&s;&s;adour with this Mo&s;&s;age put him&s;elf in a rea|dine&s;s, and with a retinue of about two hun|dred and fifty Per&s;ons, begun his Journey to|wards the end of <HI>April,</HI> and on the &s;econd of <HI>May</HI> cro&s;&s;ed the River <HI>Nie&s;tro,</HI> which divides <HI>Poland</HI> from <HI>Moldavia,</HI> where he was received by two of the Boiars, or Moldavian Noblemen, and thence conducted to <HI>Ja&s;h,</HI> where the Prince of that Country re&s;ided. The Amba&s;&s;adour expected the Vi&s;it of the Prince, according to Cu&s;tom and Articles of Peace; but the Prince being either forbidden by the Port, or rather out of an igno|rant &s;tiffne&s;s and pride, omitted to pa&s;s the Civi|lities of that Office, but yet &s;upplied the Amba&s;|&s;adour with Plenty of Wine and Provi&s;ions; which the Polanders enjoying freely, di&s;pen&s;ed perhaps more ea&s;ily with other neglects and omi&s;|&s;ions which concerned Formalities and Ceremo|nies.</P>

<P>The&s;e Pre&s;ents preceding,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Po|li&s;h Am|ba&s;&s;adours Audience.</NOTE> made way for the Amba&s;&s;adours Audience, at which he declared, That the Commi&s;&s;ion from his Ma&s;ter the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> was to make Complaints unto his Ma|je&s;ty of the grand Incur&s;ions the Tartars had made into <HI>Poland</HI> without any rea&s;on or cau&s;e of War; and that therefore his Ma&s;ter did expect from him, as from a ju&s;t and vertuous Prince, a permi&s;&s;ion for revenge, and &s;atisfaction of his injuries, to enter <HI>Tartary,</HI> without a&s;&s;uming it as any ground of Breach or Infringement of that Peace which he held with him; or el&s;e that he would by his authority enjoyn the Tartars to re|&s;tore their Captives, and their &s;poils, and render them a rea&s;onable &s;atisfaction. The Grand Sig|nior returned no reply hereunto, but referred that to be done by his Chimacam, &s;ilence being e&s;teemed &s;ome part of his Maje&s;ty and State, which he &s;eldom breaks but with few and haugh|ty words.</P>
<P>This Amba&s;&s;adour was a man of a bold and daring Spirit, a fit Orator for &s;uch an Emba&s;&s;y, had not his immoderate Covetou&s;ne&s;s, the Vice and Folly commonly incident to Old Age, much eclip&s;ed many of tho&s;e Vertues of which he was Ma&s;ter. He was al&s;o a Man of a violent temper, feavered to a madne&s;s in the height of his Cho|ler, which &s;trangely betrayed him to many un|decencies in his Language and Comportment. For at his Audience with the Chimacam, when he came to receive the Grand Signior's An&s;wer, his words were vented with that heat, and &s;o like to menaces, that the Turks taking exception thereat, returned his cour&s;e Speeches with the like Dialect, at which the Amba&s;&s;adour &s;welled with that indignation and anger, as became not the Moderation and Gravity of his Office; ad|ding in Conclu&s;ion, That he was an Aged Man, full of Years and Corporal Infirmities; that no|thing could arrive more happy to him than a Death in which he &s;hould triumph to &s;uffer for the benefit and glory of his Country. This ex|ce&s;s and intemperance of Language moved the Turks to &s;et a Guard upon him, and confine him to his own Hou&s;e in the nature of a Pri&s;oner; which violation of his Sacred Office, &s;o worked upon his Spirits, that he often vented &s;ome part of his fury in words and blows on the Officers of his Guard; for which rude behaviour having received &s;ome reproofs from the Chimacam,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Death of the Po|li&s;h Am|ba&s;&s;adour.</NOTE> his pa&s;&s;ion not knowing which way to ea&s;e it &s;elf, feavered him into a de&s;perate &s;ickne&s;s, of which in a few days, phren&s;ical and di&s;tracted, he de|parted his life.</P>
<P>The Secretary of the Emba&s;&s;y, being the next in Office, took upon him the Function and Charge of the Amba&s;&s;adour, and having now nothing to act, but to receive the An&s;wer to the Me&s;&s;age of his Ma&s;ter, for which a Day be|ing appointed, he was pre&s;ented with a Hor&s;e and Furniture by the Chimacam, of whom ha|ving Audience, he received no other &s;atisfaction to the Complaints again&s;t the Tartars than the&s;e following, which were related to me by the Se|cretary of the Emba&s;&s;y, who did me the honour to make me a Vi&s;it, when I was on my recove|ry from a dangerous Sicknes, at <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That no compen&s;ation or pretence be ever hereafter demanded for the late incur&s;ions made by the Tartars into <HI>Poland.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, That the Polanders make not War upon the Co&s;&s;acks, who had lately renounced their &s;ubjection, and were fled for protection to the Ottoman Power.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That the Poles immediately make War upon the Mu&s;covite.</P>
<P>Fourthly, That the Turk Merchants have free Trade into <HI>Poland,</HI> and that the Turki&s;h Mer|chants receive &s;atisfaction for what injuries and lo&s;&s;es they lately &s;uffered.</P>
<PB N="190" REF="99">
<P>With the&s;e Propo&s;itions and Conditions of Peace, the Secretary was di&s;patched, which did not &s;o well plea&s;e the Poles as to return thanks for them, or a Me&s;&s;enger with Advice of their Acceptance or Ratification; and though they could not but be &s;en&s;ible of the &s;corn and yoke the Turks would impo&s;e upon them, yet having &s;till remaining among&s;t them certain Reliques of their former di&s;&s;entions and diver&s;ity about ele|ction of a Succe&s;&s;our to their King, and there be|ing a certain Spirit of Luxury, Pride, and Sedi|tion which was crept in among&s;t the Nobility, they con&s;idered not the advantage of the pre&s;ent time, but willingly preferred a pre&s;ent ea&s;e, and enjoyment of their Fea&s;ts and Banquets, be|fore the hazards and uncertainties of benefit, which they might receive by the doubtful lot and fortune of War; and though never any Sea|&s;on appeared more opportune and advantageous to the Pole than this, when the flower of the Turki&s;h Youth and Force was employed in <HI>Can|dia,</HI> and all places, in part, di&s;mantled of their u&s;ual &s;trength and complement of Souldiers to defend their Frontiers; yet they &s;eemed re&s;olved to pa&s;s by the former Incur&s;ions, and Spoils, and Robberies made on their People, &s;o the Turk would but &s;top here, and permit them, without farther provocation, to enjoy their quiet, and de|bauched way of living: Only &s;ome of the Bor|derers on the Turks, who had deeply &s;uffered by the late Incur&s;ions, moved with the lo&s;s of their E&s;tates, and the Captivity of their neare&s;t Relations, joyned with a con&s;iderable number of the Mu&s;co|vites, entered <HI>Tartary</HI> in the months of <HI>October</HI> and <HI>November,</HI> and burned about three hundred Villa|ges, carrying away Captives, and other prey, from under the very Walls of <HI>Coffa.</HI></P>
<P>At this time al&s;o the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Bal&s;ora</HI> began new rumours and an un&s;ea&s;onable Rebellions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Re|volt of the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Bal&s;ora.</HI></NOTE> who being reported to have an Army of Hor&s;e and Foot con&s;i&s;ting of forty thou&s;and men, gave no &s;mall di&s;turbance and apprehen&s;ion to the Turks; who with their difficulties of War in <HI>Candia,</HI> and the jealou&s;ies of a &s;torm from <HI>Poland,</HI> remain|ed with &s;ome doubts and he&s;itancy about the way of their proceedings. At length Orders were di&s;patched to the Pa&s;haws of <HI>Erzirum, A|leppo, Dama&s;cus,</HI> and <HI>Darbequier,</HI> to unite again&s;t the Rebel, to dive&s;t him of his Government, and to &s;end his forfeited head to his Ma&s;ter. The&s;e Pa&s;haws accordingly joining their Forces, defeated the Rebel; and as all Con&s;piracies of open Rebellion di&s;tant from the Court, have had but ill &s;ucce&s;s in the&s;e Countries again&s;t the true Prince, &s;o this Pa&s;ha was routed, and be|ing for&s;aken by his Servants, fled with a few Hor&s;e to the Protection of the King of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> The principal Cau&s;e which moved the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Bal&s;ora</HI> (as I was informed from the mouth of the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Dama&s;cus</HI>) to this Rebellion, was the Confidence he had in his own &s;trength, and the fidelity of his people, to whom of ancient right, that Government was of hereditary Suc|ce&s;&s;ion, de&s;cended to him by his Ance&s;tors for many Generations: by which means he challeng|ed &s;uch ab&s;olute intere&s;t in his Principality, that for many Years he refu&s;ed to acknowledge the Grand Signior by any other tokens of homage, than in the bare name of his Protector, and in making Publick Prayers for his Pro&s;perity and Victories. But at length the Grand Signior com|ing to impo&s;e farther on him, &s;tirred his hot de|&s;ires into Rebellion, and to an open defiance.</P>
<P>About the beginning of this Year the Captain-General <HI>Cornaro,</HI> with the Proveditor of the Armata <HI>France&s;co Barbaro,</HI> returned to <HI>Venice,</HI> bringing with them one <HI>Ramadam</HI> a Sangiack of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and other Slaves taken by the Captains <HI>Grimani</HI> and <HI>Molini.</HI> The manner was this: <HI>Ra|madam,</HI> with three and twenty Ships, laden with Men and Ammunion, endeavoured to enter into <HI>Canea,</HI> but being charged by the Venetians, and overcome, &s;et &s;ire to their Ship, and leaping in|to the Schiff to &s;ave their Lives, were taken by the Boat of <HI>Molino;</HI> and though fourteen Gallies came out of <HI>Canea</HI> to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, yet they could not hinder the taking of five of their Ships, be&s;ides &s;everal others which were put a&s;hore and &s;trand by four Malte&s;e Cor&s;airs, who entered in|to the Fight, being called at a di&s;tance by the &s;ound of the Cannon. About that time al&s;o a Turki&s;h Gally was &s;urrendred by the Indu&s;try and Ingenuity of the Slaves, who having &s;ecretly boared &s;ome holes in the bottom of the Gally, and plugged them up afterwards, &s;o as that they might let in the Water, or &s;top it when they plea&s;ed; it happened that the Gally being near the Rock, which is called <HI>Polycandro,</HI> they &s;e|cretly drew out the plug, whereby &s;o great a Flood of Water on a &s;udden came in, that the Gally being ready to &s;ink, the Turks affrighted for&s;ook the Gally to &s;ave them&s;elves on the Rock, leaving the Slaves in the Gally to &s;hift as well as they could. The Slaves being thus freed of their Ma&s;ters the Turks, plugged up the hol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s again, and clearing the Gally of Water, rowed away, and delivered them&s;elves into the hands of the Vene|tians; upon which advice, the Captain General di&s;patched the Captain of the Gulf <HI>Lorenzo Cor|naro</HI> with two Gallies to that Rock, where they became ma&s;ters of all the Turks except two, who threw them&s;elves into the Sea, preferring Death before Slavery.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> recalled Marque&s;s <HI>Villa,</HI> who was his Subject, from <HI>Can|dia;</HI> the rea&s;ons for which was attributed to an appearance of Breach with <HI>Geneva,</HI> the Switzers and the Valtelines, who were his Subjects, or rather to the ill Offices of tho&s;e who envied his preferment, being de&s;irous to have him recalled from a place of &s;o much honour and reputation. In obedience to this revocation Marque&s;s <HI>Villa</HI> taking his leave of General <HI>Cornaro,</HI> returned from <HI>Candia</HI> as far as <HI>Zant;</HI> where meeting the new Captain General <HI>France&s;co Mora&s;idi,</HI> and be|ing by him a&s;&s;ured, That the Pope, and Se|nate of <HI>Venice</HI> repre&s;enting the difficulty of Af|fairs in <HI>Candia,</HI> and the pre&s;ent urgency and ne|ce&s;&s;ity for his pre&s;ence there, had obtained Li|cen&s;e from the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> for his continu|ance in that employment; upon which a&s;&s;urance, Marque&s;s <HI>Villa</HI> took a re&s;olution to return again to <HI>Candia,</HI> being accompanied with a &s;trong Squadran of Ve&s;&s;els carrying con&s;iderable quan|tities both of Amunition and Provi&s;ions.</P>

<HEAD>The Hi&s;tory of the famous Siege of <HI>Candia.</HI></HEAD>
<P>On the <HI>27th</HI> of <HI>April</HI> the Forces from <HI>Egypt</HI> under the Command of <HI>Me&s;&s;ir Bey</HI> appeared in the field, and on the <HI>5th</HI> of <HI>May N S.</HI> the General of the Jani&s;aries incamped on the right &s;ide of New <HI>Candia,</HI> that he might better view and &s;urvey the ground near the <HI>Laza|retto.</HI></P>
<P>At the beginning of the New Moon of this Year's <HI>May,</HI> being the 12/22th day of the month, publick Prayers being fir&s;t made through the mo&s;t principal places of the Empire for the &s;ucce&s;s of the Ottoman Arms, and &s;o &s;olemnly continued every <HI>Monday</HI> and <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> for the &s;pace of a year; the Great Vizier fir&s;t appear|ed before the renowned Fortre&s;s of <HI>Candia,</HI> and began the memorable Siege of that City, which for the &s;pace of twenty five years pre|ceding had been the &s;ubject to which the &s;pecial care and expence of <HI>Venice,</HI> and the Art of the mo&s;t &s;ubtle Engineers of the World, as far as humanely was po&s;&s;ible, did concur to render it the mo&s;t impregnable Fortre&s;s of the Univer&s;e.</P>
<P>The Town was fortified with &s;even great Ba&s;tions, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Sabionera, Vetturi, Je&s;us, Martinengo, Betlem, Panigra,</HI> and St. <HI>Andrea;</HI> the&s;e were all incompa&s;&s;ed with a large and deep Ditch, of which were the Revelin of St. <HI>Spirito,</HI> the Revelin of <HI>Panigra</HI> flanked to the right with the Half-moon of <HI>Mocenigo:</HI> next hereunto was the Revelin of <HI>Betlem</HI> bordering on the Work of St. <HI>Maries,</HI> which to the left had the Revelin of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> and this ad|joyned to the Fortification of <HI>de Palma,</HI> next whereunto was the Revelin of <HI>Priuli,</HI> with the Redoubt of <HI>Crepa-cuore;</HI> and over all was the Royal Fort of St. <HI>Demetrio,</HI> which command|ed the Work of <HI>Molino</HI> and <HI>Sabionera</HI> unto the very Sea.</P>
<P>Marque&s;s <HI>Villa</HI> at his la&s;t return was chiefly intent to &s;trengthen the Fortifications, and re|pair the Out-works, e&s;pecially that of St. <HI>An|drea</HI> which was almo&s;t ruined, and the old &s;ubterranean Traver&s;es were &s;o full of water, and the old Galleries &s;o high, that the Enemy could ea&s;ily pa&s;s under them, all which he re|paired and amended in a &s;hort time. In con|fidence of gaining this &s;trong Fortre&s;s, the Turks demoli&s;hed New <HI>Candia,</HI> &s;ituate about two miles from the Old, which the Vizier now pointed out to them as a better Seat, and in|couraged them to win and inhabit it; &s;o that 14/24th of <HI>May</HI> the Turks incamped over again&s;t St. <HI>Maries</HI> along the Valley of <HI>Gioffiro</HI> with the &s;ound of their Drums and Trumpets, and firing great Guns and Vollies of Muskets. Their Forces at fir&s;t con&s;i&s;ted of about forty thou&s;and fighting Men, and eight thou&s;and Pioniers, but &s;oon afterwards increa&s;ed to &s;eventy thou&s;and, and &s;o for the mo&s;t part were maintained during the Siege.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Traver&s;es began from the &s;ide of St. <HI>Maries,</HI> and were carried to the Sea, the Great Vizier took his Quarters over again&s;t <HI>Panigra,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The di&s;po&s;i|tion of the Turks Camp.</NOTE> the Jani&s;ar-Aga again&s;t <HI>Martinengo,</HI> and other Pa&s;ha's between that and <HI>Betlem.</HI> On the other &s;ide the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Romelia</HI> in|camped again&s;t the <HI>Lazaretto,</HI> and <HI>Catirgi-Ogle</HI> Pa&s;ha of <HI>Canea</HI> again&s;t <HI>Sabionera, Achmet</HI> Pa|&s;ha Vizier of the Camp, and <HI>Zagargiba&s;hee</HI> Major General of the Jani&s;aries, who had the reputation of old &s;ouldiers and good Engineers, were ordered to inlarge and lengthen the Traver&s;es on the &s;ide of the Half-Moon of <HI>Mocenigo.</HI> Quarters being thus a&s;&s;igned, they rai&s;ed three<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The Bat|teries rai&s;|ed by the Turks.</NOTE> Batteries, the fir&s;t again&s;t the Ba&s;tion of <HI>Martinengo,</HI> and the right &s;ide of the Work St. <HI>Maries;</HI> a &s;econd again&s;t <HI>Pani|gra;</HI> and &s;oon after a third again&s;t the Half|moon and Bulwark of <HI>Betlem,</HI> from whence they continualy thundered with their great Cannons, &s;hooting Bullets of &s;ixty, ninety to an hundred and twenty pound weight.</P>
<P>Nor were the Be&s;ieged within le&s;s indu&s;trious or wi&s;e in the di&s;po&s;ition of their Affairs; for Marque&s;s <HI>Villa</HI> took his Quarters at the en|trance of the Bulwark <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> Proveditor <HI>Bar|baro</HI> at <HI>Panigra,</HI> the Proveditor General of the Kingdom at <HI>Martinengo,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Candia, France&s;co Battaglia,</HI> in the Fort of <HI>Sabionera,</HI> and other Officers between the Curtains of St. <HI>Andrea, Betlem,</HI> and <HI>Sabionera.</HI></P>
<P>Things thus di&s;po&s;ed on both &s;ides, many and various were the valiant A&s;&s;aults and Sallies, the Traver&s;es extraordinary, the Ren|counters bloody, the re&s;i&s;tance vigorous, not known or recorded in any Siege before; which though they can never be fully expre&s;&s;ed, or particularly denoted, yet I &s;hould do injury to the a&s;hes of tho&s;e Heroick Chri&s;tians who &s;o freely entred the Li&s;t, and on this Theatre of the World &s;acrificed their lives in defence of Chri&s;tendom, &s;hould I not &s;ignalize &s;ome of them of divers Nations for their Prowe&s;s and Valour. And here pardon me, good Reader, if I come &s;hort or fail in this relation, where many of unparalleled Valour and Vertue dyed ob&s;curely and unknown, and the numbers of others &s;o great, that to &s;pecifie them all, were to &s;well this Work to a larger Volume than the Book of Martyrs. Here was that Martial field into which remote Nations and uncon|cerned de&s;cended, carried thither by zeal to the Chri&s;tian cau&s;e, or by certain Principles of Valour and Magnanimity; &s;o that though the War bore no other denomination than of the Venetian and the Turk, yet &s;o great was the confluence of both parts of the World to this little I&s;le, as if it had been cho&s;en by unani|mous con&s;ent for a Stage to try the Title to the Univer&s;al Empire. The Town being thus be|leagured on all &s;ides, but where<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The fir&s;t Mine blown up.</NOTE> <HI>Neptune</HI> the Spou&s;e of <HI>Venice</HI> kept it open, the Chri&s;tians endeavoured fir&s;t to di&s;turb the Traver&s;es of the Turks by a Mine of Powder which they blew up; but through the neglect or little ex|perience of the Engineer, it being the fir&s;t which they had fired, reverted, and did more hurt to them&s;elves than to the Enemy; the errour of which being ob&s;erved, another For|nello was fired, which taking its due place and mea&s;ures, &s;o affrighted the Turks, as yet not acquainted with this manner and invention of War, that they began at the fir&s;t on&s;et to be di&s;couraged, con&s;idering that if the ground was un&s;ecure and un&s;table at that di&s;tance what aby&s;&s;es and cha&s;mes mu&s;t there be prepared to make them graves under the Walls or entrance to the City. To &s;econd and ju&s;tifie this Gun|powder Plot the Chri&s;tians made two Sallies, one by the Savoyards under Command of Co|lonel <HI>Profito Tor&s;e,</HI> who i&s;&s;ued forth from the Revelin of <HI>Betlem,</HI> and made great &s;laughter of

<P>About this time arrived at <HI>Standi</HI> the Captain-General <HI>France&s;co Moro&s;ini,</HI> who after &s;ome Con&s;ultation di&s;arming his Fleet of about a thou&s;and men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cap|tain-Gene|ral di&s;arms is Gallies.</NOTE> entred with that Succour into the Town, and yet fitted out a convenient Squadron of Gallies and Gallea&s;&s;es to rove in the <HI>Archipelago</HI> to hinder the Enemies Succours and Recruits, which were de&s;igned for <HI>Candia.</HI> In this interim the Turks repaired the old Battery again&s;t the <HI>Lazaretto,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Five Mines the Chri|&s;tians &s;prang.</NOTE> and laboured continually in their Galleries and &s;ubterranean Works; &s;o that by that time that the Chri|&s;tians had &s;prang five Fornelli upon them to|wards the point of the Half-moon of <HI>Mocenigo,</HI> the Turks had advanced &s;o well towards the Borders of <HI>Panigra,</HI> that they &s;prang two Mines; but the&s;e being but the fir&s;t proofs or e&s;&s;ays of this kind of invention, reverted on them&s;elves with the lo&s;s of two hundred of their men, and again fired a third with little &s;ucce&s;s: which the Chri&s;tians an&s;wered to better purpo&s;e, blowing up &s;ixty or &s;eventy Turks. Wherefore the Turks made a farther tryal of two Mines by the Half-moon, rather to their own lo&s;s, than to the damage of their Enemy.</P>
<P>In all the month of <HI>July</HI> pa&s;&s;ed not a day without &s;ome con&s;iderable action, &s;ometimes to good, &s;ometimes with bad &s;ucce&s;s to both Parties; every day Mines were &s;prank on both &s;ides, de&s;troying the Lines, and overthrowing the Galleries;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Attempts of the Turks on the &s;ide of <HI>Panigra.</HI></NOTE> but the main force and heat of the War as it were concentring it &s;elf towards the Quarters of <HI>Panigra,</HI> in defence thereof the Engineer <HI>Castellan</HI> as freely as couragiou&s;ly proffered the u&s;e of his Art, and the hazard of his Per&s;on.

But neither did the Prior <HI>Bichi</HI> Commander of the Popes Gallies, nor <HI>Doria</HI> Admiral of tho&s;e of <HI>Naples,</HI> act agreeable to the bravery of tho&s;e French Gentlemen; for they not only denied, as we have &s;aid, to land a &s;mall num|ber of their men, but as if they came only to make them a vi&s;it, &s;ent this &s;hort Letter of Advice dated the <HI>24th</HI> of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> in the&s;e words. <HI>The Auxiliary Gallies are obliged to de|part this night and to return to</HI> Suda, <HI>where they are to remain until the expiration of that time which is appointed for them in the&s;e Seas.</HI> Prior <HI>Bichi</HI> likewi&s;e &s;ent word to Marque&s;s <HI>Villa,</HI> That he judged it fit to depart, by rea&s;on that no action pre&s;ented for them to undertake: to which the Marque&s;s replied, That he who &s;eeks may find, and that &s;uch opportunities never offer to tho&s;e who endeavour to avoid them. <HI>Doria</HI> al&s;o, to colour his excu&s;es, &s;aid, That his Orders were not to land men, unle&s;s the Town were in the extremity of danger of being taken; to which <HI>Villa</HI> replyed, That he could not well be a&s;&s;ured in what condition the Town was, &s;ince he never vouch&s;afed to &s;et his foot a&s;hore, or conceived a curio&s;ity of &s;eeing the greate&s;t and the mo&s;t famous Siege that ever was in the World. In &s;hort, the&s;e Holy and Catholick Squadrons departed without contri|buting any a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the Chri&s;tians, incur|ring thereby the &s;evere cen&s;ure of the Com|manders in chief, with the anger and di&s;dain of of the Souldiery.</P>
<P>The Venetians have always thought it Policy to maintain an Agent in the Ottoman Quarters, perhaps with de&s;ign to afford them Intelligence, or to be ready to apply Terms of Peace in times of mo&s;t urgent nece&s;&s;ities.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Agent arrives at <HI>Candia</HI> to treat with the Vizier.</NOTE> According to which Rule Signior <HI>Giavarina</HI> was &s;ent to <HI>Candia</HI> upon the Venetian Armata, now go|verned at Sea by one <HI>Pa&s;qualino,</HI> with In&s;tructi|ons to treat with the Vizier, and perhaps to grant him any thing be&s;ides <HI>Candia,</HI> though without this nothing could come either wel|come or &s;atisfactory to the Turks. How&s;oever to introduce him into the Camp, a white Flag was di&s;played on the &s;ide of the <HI>Lazaretto;</HI> which when the Turks perceived, they flocked in great numbers to know the my&s;tery of this Signal of Pacification. And though nothing appeared, be&s;ides a Letter directed to the Great Vizier, yet they hoped it might portend &s;omething of Treaty, which in the end would produce a Peace, and a conclu&s;ion of their la|bours, before the Winter &s;urpri&s;ed them in
<PB N="197" REF="100">their colder Lodgings. The Vizier having read the Letter, had his thoughts rai&s;ed as high as was po&s;&s;ible in hopes of a Surrender; and therefore mo&s;t freely ordered, That Sig|nior <HI>Giavarina</HI> &s;hould the Sunday following come to the Valley of <HI>Gioffiro</HI> with what Atten|dance and Followers he judged fit, proffering at the &s;ame time a ce&s;&s;ation of Arms and all acts of Ho&s;tility: but the Chri&s;tians who were not reduced to that extremity as to crave Peace, or a re&s;pite from action, kindly refu&s;ed his gentle proffer, which &s;o inraged the Vizier, that in a fury he gave fire to a Mine on the left &s;ide of <HI>Panigra,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Turks a&s;&s;ault <HI>Pa|nigra.</HI></NOTE> which was &s;econded with that furious a&s;&s;ault, that <HI>Panigra</HI> had been put into great danger, had not the courage of the Defendants been &s;upereminent, and repul&s;ed the Enemy with &s;o great a &s;laughter, that the earth round about was covered with dead bodies: which action was &s;econded by a brisk Sally performed by &s;ome Knights of <HI>Malta,</HI> as <HI>la Mai&s;on Neufve, de Langeron, de Clement, de Monro&s;ier, de Charboniere,</HI> and <HI>de Blanbui&s;&s;on,</HI> though again&s;t the advice and coun&s;el of Marque&s;s <HI>Villa,</HI> of which the two fir&s;t were &s;lain, and the re&s;t returned with honour and &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>At the end of this month of <HI>July</HI> the Gar|ri&s;on received a Supply of &s;ix hundred Foot under Command of <HI>Ottavio Abia,</HI> a noble Venetian, who likewi&s;e made his entry more acceptable by twenty thou&s;and Ducats which he brought with him. At the time of his arrival the Chri&s;tians fired a Mine with good &s;ucce&s;s, but the Enemy had prepared another in re|venge, which took &s;uch effect on the right Angle of <HI>Panigra,</HI> as broke the Counter&s;carp ten paces, and filled the Ditch with Earth, on advantage of which the Turks came to an A&s;&s;ault, but through the courage of <HI>Luca Grandis</HI> Serjeant Major, and other gallant Officers, a &s;top was given to the Enemies fury, and they beaten off with con&s;iderable lo&s;s.</P>
<P>And now for the pre&s;ent all Sallies cea&s;ed, whil&s;t both &s;ides carried on their de&s;igns under ground, thwarthing and cro&s;&s;ing the Mines, each of other; in which &s;ubterranean Travels and Pa&s;&s;ages, the Miners often met, and had frequent and bloody Encounters, tho&s;e that were &s;tronge&s;t robbed the Powder and Uten&s;ils of the weaker, &s;o that the Scene of War &s;eemed to be transferred <HI>ad inferos,</HI> and to be carried on with more fury and violence in the Grave, or the other world, than it was in the open Air of the Cydonian Fields.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Turks fire a dreadful. Mine.</NOTE> The Turks becoming now as expert as the Chri&s;tia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> in their &s;ecret and hidden Traver&s;es, had pene|trated &s;o far, that on the <HI>8th</HI> of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> they fired a mo&s;t dreadful Mine on the &s;ide of the half Moon, which made &s;o great a Breach in that work, that eight men could march a brea&s;t; which &s;o animated the Enemy with the advantage, that immediately in great num|bers they mounted the breach to give an A&s;&s;ault; but &s;upplies being timely afforded in a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Guard, the Enemy was pre|cipitated headlong, and overwhelmed with &s;uch &s;howers of Musket &s;hot, that the Retreat into their works was not only di&s;orderly, but the number of tho&s;e who &s;urvived &s;o few and dimini&s;hed, as gave proof how hazardous it was to attempt other more difficult and better fortified Ba&s;tions.</P>
<P>Nor was the &s;ucce&s;s of the Turks le&s;s on the &s;ide of <HI>Panigra,</HI> where having made a Breach, they endeavoured to make good their ground under &s;helter of Sacks of earth, which the Chri&s;tians drew away from them with long iron hooks, which was &s;uch a piece of &s;port to the be&s;ieged to &s;ee their Enemies di&s;mantled of their &s;helter, and lye open to their &s;hot, that a young Page of Marque&s;s <HI>Villa,</HI> called <HI>du Clos,</HI> venturing in this action beyond his years, was &s;hot with a Musket Bullet in the head, and &s;o ha&s;tned to the other World covered with glory and renown.</P>
<P>There was &s;carce now a day which pa&s;&s;ed, that was not &s;ignalized with the &s;pringing of &s;everal Mines both on one &s;ide and the other; mo&s;t of tho&s;e made by the Chri&s;tians were &s;econded with Sallies, and tho&s;e of the Turks with A&s;&s;aults and Stormings of one Fort or other. On the <HI>10th</HI> of <HI>September</HI> Signior <HI>da Riva,</HI> a noble Venetian, arrived with a Re|cruit of five hundred Souldiers, and a great number of Pioneers, and the &s;ame day was ce|lebrated, after the u&s;ual manner, by &s;pringing of Mines; one of which threw a Turk on the Fort of <HI>Panigra,</HI> and ruined the Galleries of the Enemy; the next day likewi&s;e &s;everal Fornelli were fired by the Enginier <HI>Lubatiers</HI> from the parts of the half Moon, and of <HI>Pani|gra,</HI> which filled up the Line, and &s;poiled the Redoubts of the Turks.</P>
<P>On the <HI>15th</HI> the Chri&s;tians vigorou&s;ly &s;al|lied out with &s;eventy Foot, under the Com|mand of Colonel <HI>Vechia,</HI> and two other Cap|tains from the Revelin of <HI>Panigra,</HI> who after a valiant skirmi&s;h, orderly retreated under the rampart of the Revelin; to which place the Turks eagerly pur&s;uing them, were enter|tained with a Mine, and to&s;&s;ed into the Air; which being done, the Venetians returned again, and were in the &s;ame manner encoun|tred by the Turks, whereby a very hot fight began; during which time the Captain General, who &s;tood on the Ba&s;tion of <HI>Betlem</HI> to ob&s;erve the motions of the Enemy, &s;aluted them with a plentiful &s;hower of Musket &s;hot. In &s;hort, after the Venetians had for the &s;pace of an hour re&s;i&s;ted the Force of the Enemy with much &s;laughter, they retired with good order into the Ditch of the City.</P>
<P>On the <HI>18th</HI> Captain <HI>Fedeli,</HI> with a hun|dred Souldiers, made another Sally, but be|ing wounded, he retreated with &s;ome lo&s;s; which was retured again on the Enemy by a Mine which the Enginier <HI>Quadruplani</HI> &s;prang with happy &s;ucce&s;s on the Quarter of <HI>Panigra;</HI> and on the &s;ame day the Captain of the Gal|lea&s;&s;es, called <HI>Gio&s;eppe Moro&s;ini,</HI> arriving with five hundred men, and two hundred thou&s;and Ducats together with good quantities of Am|munition and Victuals, gave encouragement and relief to all the City; with whom al&s;o came the Cavalier <HI>Gonges</HI> and his Brother, in quality of Adventurers for Honour and Re|ligion. There was not one day in all this Month, but divers Fornelli and Mines were fired on one &s;ide and the other; and though, the Chri&s;tians exerci&s;ed as much military Art, Indu&s;try, and Valour, as men were capable to perform, yet the Turks &s;till gained ground, and daily advanced their works upon the Chri&s;tians; wherefore the Captain General ordered that a Mine and three Fornelli &s;hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d be fired; by which a &s;mall Fort of the Turks,
<PB N="198" REF="101">near the Counter&s;carp, was overthrown, with divers other works lately rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Turks had &s;uch good &s;ucce&s;s with their la&s;t Mines, that a Week after they fired another, which was calculated &s;o well that it ruined the Gallery of Communication between <HI>Panigra</HI> and its Out-works, and threw the Counter|&s;carp into the Ditch of the Town;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Turks &s;pring ans|ther Mine.</NOTE> For the nece&s;|&s;ary repair of which Breach, and clearing of the Ditch, the Governors gave immediate Order, and appointed a &s;trong Guard for de|fence and protection of tho&s;e that laboured; and to make better di&s;patch, a mo&s;t ingenious Engine was contrived to remove and rid the Ditch of Earth, which whil&s;t it worked with admirable &s;ucce&s;s, the Turks, by help of a Mine, blew it into the Air, and &s;hattered it into a thou&s;and pieces. How&s;oever, the Chri|&s;tians de&s;i&s;ted not from their intended work, but &s;till laboured with Baskets, Sacks, and Wheelbarrows to carry away the Earth; which that they might do quietly and undi|&s;turbed, the Savoyards and Sclavonians made a furious and de&s;perate Sally, which continued for the &s;pace of two hours; and though in that time the Enemy had opportunity to col|lect their greater Force into a Body, yet the Chri&s;tians were not put to flight, but retreated orderly, and in a fighting po&s;ture, though with the lo&s;s of &s;everal Officers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two Mines of the Chri&s;tians.</NOTE> of which were Cap|tain <HI>R&egrave;,</HI> and others. To revenge the&s;e mines of the Turks, the Chri&s;tians fired two others as dreadful as the others; the fir&s;t near St. <HI>Spi|rito,</HI> which being under the Enemies Traver&s;es, performed its de&s;ired Effect; the &s;econd was on the &s;ide of the half Moon, which &s;wallowed up two of their Redoubts; And on the third of <HI>October</HI> they fired four other mines on the &s;ides of <HI>Panigra</HI> and <HI>Betlem,</HI> one of which con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ix and thirty Barrels of Powder, and another of fourteen, ordering at the &s;ame time a furious Sally from divers places; as namely,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Four Mines and a Sally of the Chri&s;tians.</NOTE> Captain <HI>Gamba</HI> &s;allied from the Re|velin of St. <HI>Spirito,</HI> Serjeant Major <HI>Ara&s;i</HI> from under the Bulwark of <HI>Panigra.</HI> Colonel <HI>George Maria</HI> was ordered to a&s;&s;ault the Redoubts which were oppo&s;ed to the Breach; Colonel <HI>Vechia</HI> to attaque the Redoubts between <HI>Pani|gra</HI> and the half Moon, Colonel <HI>Crema&s;co</HI> and <HI>Marini</HI> to a&s;&s;ault the redoubts between the half Moon and <HI>Betlem.</HI> Count <HI>Bru&s;a&s;co</HI> de|fended the work of St. <HI>Maria,</HI> Colonel <HI>Inberti</HI> defended the Revelin of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> and Scrjeant <HI>Motta</HI> with thirty able Souldiers ad|vanced to the farthe&s;t Lines of the Enemy, killing and putting to flight all before them. Colonel <HI>Frigeri</HI> Captain of the Fort St. <HI>Di|metry,</HI> and Lieutenant Colonel <HI>Vimes</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;everal Redoubts; and in the conclu&s;ion all retreated in excellent order with &s;ucce&s;s and triumph, to vield the Turks evident arguments of their fortitude and courage; and that the Town was &s;till &s;o well provided, as not only to be in a Condition of defending it &s;elf, but offending the Enemy.</P>
<P>Yet the Turks were &s;till labouring to coun|termine the <HI>Fornelli</HI> of the Enemy, and to revenge the former Plots; to which end they had penetrated to the mo&s;t inward works of <HI>Panigra;</HI> but the Pioniers, employed by the Engineer <HI>Quadruplani,</HI> di&s;covering their Gal|lery, entred boldly in, and drove away the Turks from whom they took thirty two Bar|rels of Powder, and by that means for the pre|&s;ent pre&s;erved that work, and the Lives of many Souldiers.</P>
<P>The <HI>17th</HI> of <HI>October</HI> the Chri&s;tians &s;prang two Mines, one of thirty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two Mines of the Chri&s;tians.</NOTE> and another of five and thirty Barrels of Powder, which did the de&s;ired execution upon the Turks; which &s;ome brave &s;pirits &s;econded by a bold Sally, among&s;t which none was more eminent than a Greek Prie&s;t, who moved with zeal to his Country, entered far into the Enemies Tren|ches, where having killed a Per&s;on of Quality hand to hand, he was returning with the Tro|phy of his head; but being in the way inter|cepted by three at once, he was unequally matched, and &s;lain, and died with the high|e&s;t honour imaginable under the Walls of his Native City.</P>
<P>Soon after the Cavalier <HI>Verneda,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">One Mine of the Chri&s;tians.</NOTE> another Engineer, fired a Mine of forty Barrels of powder, which made the very City and Works tremble, like an Earthquake; for whereas this Mine &s;hould have taken its effect on the Ene|mies Redoubts, Providence ordered that it &s;hould take its pa&s;&s;age through an old Gallery with &s;o much violence and Smoak that it &s;uffoca|ted the Miners, Carpenters, and Ma&s;ons, to the number of &s;ixty men.</P>
<P>Towards the end of this Summer the Turks at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> and <HI>Adrianople</HI> grew big with the expectation of the happy News and Arrival of that me&s;&s;enger that &s;hould declare the taking of <HI>Candia,</HI> and the end of the Vene|tian War; to entertain which joy with the more readine&s;s, they had prepared Lights, and Lamps, and artificial Fire-works to &s;olem|nize their<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Which is their Triumph for Vi|ctory.</NOTE> <HI>Dunalma,</HI> and made publick prayers and proce&s;&s;ion of the youth of the City twice a week; but finding their hopes fru&s;trated, and their joys from Month to Month deferred, their expectations became tyred and wearied, and growing almo&s;t a&s;hamed of their di&s;appoint|ment, began to throw the blame of the mi&s;|carriage of their Affairs on the ill Conduct of the Vizier, and the &s;luggi&s;hne&s;s of their Soul|diery.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The G. Sig|nior &s;ends a Me&s;&s;enger to bring him cer|tain infor|mation of the state of his Camp in <HI>Candia.</HI></NOTE> The Grand Signior al&s;o more impa|tient than the re&s;t, di&s;patched away a Me&s;&s;enger with Letters to the Vizier, reproaching his cowardi&s;e and &s;loth; that being provided with a mo&s;t pui&s;&s;ant Army, and with all other ap|pointments of War, &s;hould &s;uffer the Ottoman Forces to be baffled and entertained in taking a &s;ingle Fort for longer time, than formerly it had been in &s;ubduing whole Provinces and Kingdoms; and moreover charged the Me&s;|&s;enger to bring him a faithful and true Relation of the &s;tate of all Affairs, and what was the rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">u&s;e and difficulty that &s;o long ob&s;tructed the progre&s;s of his Arms; but yet &s;ent the Vizier for his encouragement a Sword, and a Ve&s;t of Sables, as tokens of his favour. The Great Vizier moved with this me&s;&s;age, re&s;olved to give &s;ome certain proofs of his indu&s;try and valour, and either to take the place, or el&s;e at lea&s;t to convince his Ma|&s;ter, by the knowledge and te&s;timony of his Inqui&s;itor, that the Work was of more hazard and longer time than was apprehended in the Seraglio. Whereupon preparations were made, and the time of a&s;&s;ault was appointed chiefly on the &s;ide of <HI>Panigra,</HI> &s;o that pre&s;&s;ing valiantly forward, they planted &s;ix of their Colours on the ruines of that work; &s;o that now, full of hope and courage, they adventured to de&s;cend into the Ditch, but being prevented by three
<PB N="199" REF="101">Mines, which contained &s;eventy Barrels of powder, they were mounted in the air with &s;o much noi&s;e and violence, that many Bodies were to&s;&s;ed on the Rampire of the Town, many of their greate&s;t Redoubts overthrown, and Graves made for multitudes of the A&s;&s;ai|lants. This A&s;&s;ault as it began with great fury, &s;o it continued for many hours; in which action Signior <HI>Pi&s;ani,</HI> Proveditor General of the Kingdom, was killed by a Granado. How&s;o|ever, the Enemy was repul&s;ed by the valour of the Chri&s;tians, in&s;omuch that the Turks growing faint were pre&s;&s;ed forward by the Vizier, who, to encourage his Souldiers, pro|mi&s;ed an extraordinary reward of honour and mony to him who &s;hould but fir&s;t touch the Walls with his hands. The hopes of riches and honour &s;o pricked forward all conditions of the Souldiery, that the Commonalty de&s;perately threw them&s;elves at all, and endangered &s;o fat the taking of <HI>Panigra,</HI> that they had certainly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of it, had not the Vene|tians had recour&s;e to their la&s;t refuge of Mines, and blown the whole Work into the Air, by which peri&s;hed three Pa&s;haws, and great num|bers of common Souldiers. And this for the pre&s;ent a&s;toni&s;hed the Turks, and gave a &s;top to the farther proceedings of this A&s;&s;ault. This proof gave an evident Conviction to the Grand Signior's Inqui&s;itor of the &s;trength of the place, and difficulty of the Work; and having been an Eye-witne&s;s of all, returned with di&s;|mal Stories of a cruel War, reporting perhaps, and it was related in the parts of Chri&s;tendom, That this was a place where blood was &s;pilt day and night, where Gallant Men had forgot to &s;leep, living in perpetual labours, enured to intolerable &s;ufferings and hourly dangers, there being none &s;ecure either in the Church, in the hou&s;e, or in the &s;treet; for Granadoes rained, Cannons thundred, Arrows flew, with &s;tones like a Tempe&s;t; &s;o that there was none in that place, but who quartered on the Brink of the Grave.</P>
<P>It now grew towards Winter, and yet the Vizier thought of no other Quarters than his Trenches, judging that if he &s;hould quit his &s;tation, the labours and progre&s;s of the former Summer would be lo&s;t, and the Work to be again begun in the Spring. Wherefore re|&s;olving to keep his Works, provided all con|veyances to carry away the Water, and &s;heds to ca&s;t off the Rain, and warmer Tents for the Soldiery, which yet could not &s;o artifi|cially be contrived, but that the Camp was full of mire and dirt, tedious and trouble&s;ome to Man and Bea&s;t, and the Quarters of the Souldiery, &s;o damp between their Banks of Earth, as cau&s;ed Catarrhs, Fluxes, Feavers, and other Camp Di&s;ea&s;es with much mortality.</P>
<P>It was now the dead of Winter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Winter cau&s;es all Action to cea&s;e.</NOTE> and yet Martial Exploits were as frequent as they had been in Summer; and though the great rains and flouds of water extingui&s;hed the fires, and made, as it were a ce&s;&s;ation of Arms, and of all acts of ho&s;tility; yet this interval of calm|ne&s;s and tranquillity the Chri&s;tians made u&s;e of to repair the Pali&s;ade of St. <HI>Andrea,</HI> and the Lines of Communication within the Ditch. And becau&s;e the main Bulwark was al&s;o &s;haken, and in &s;ome danger, all the Chiorma or Slaves of the Gallies were commanded a &s;hore to labour in the reparation, and to make an inward retrenchment, which in &s;hort time, with admirable diligence, was per&s;ected, and on all &s;ides compleated.</P>
<P>The Turks in the mean time carried their Traver&s;es forward as much as they could, for they were now entered into the very Ditch of the Town; and becau&s;e there was no po&s;&s;ibility to work in the Mines, by rea&s;on that the Gal|leries were filled with water, they attended wholly to employ their great Guns, and fire Granadoes, &s;o that they rai&s;ed a new Eattery near the Work of <HI>Mocenigo,</HI> which began to batter the lower parts of St. <HI>Andrea,</HI> and rai&s;ed another Battery on the ruines of the Revelin of <HI>Panigra,</HI> which being lower ground could not much prejudice the main Bulwark.</P>
<P>The Sultan &s;atisfied with the Relation given by his Me&s;&s;enger concerning the progre&s;s his Vizier had made upon the Town, and of the hopes there was in time to gain it, encouraged him with a Letter of Prai&s;e, accompanied with a Sword, and Ve&s;t of Sables, the magnificent Signal of the Sultans favour. And now be|&s;ides the Force of Fire-Arms, the Turks made u&s;e of Arrows, &s;lot into the Town, carrying papers written in Italian and French, per|&s;wading the Souldiers to fly to their Camp, where they &s;hould receive civil treatment, and a &s;ecure refuge; which gave that encourage|ment to tho&s;e wearied with the labours of the Siege and hard u&s;age, that many of them made Tryal of the Turks entertainment, and e&s;caping out of the Works, fled to the Enemies Camp, where they were cloathed, received Conduct Mony, and were permitted Licence to embark them&s;elves for what place they plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>About this time the Proveditor General <HI>Bar|baro</HI> and the Lieutenant General of the Artillery <HI>&V;vertmiller</HI> having obtained licence from the Senate, returned to <HI>Venice;</HI> the fir&s;t was di&s;|plea&s;ed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">General <HI>Barbaro</HI> and <HI>Uvert|miller</HI> de|parted from the Army.</NOTE> that Marque&s;s <HI>Villa</HI> &s;hould take the precedence of him; and the other, becau&s;e his opinion of making a general Sally of all the Garri&s;on on the Enemy was not followed, but rejected by the Council of War, as a de&s;ign pernicious and over-hazardous; for that the fighting with an Enemy more numerous than them&s;elves, fortified in their Redoubts and Works, and hidden under ground in inextri|cable Labyrinths, was an Enterpri&s;e &s;o ra&s;h, that no man wi&s;hing well to the Garri&s;on, and of &s;ound judgment ought to advi&s;e.</P>
<P>The Turks having in this Campagne fixed them&s;elves well in a formal Siege, and gained ground, and many advantages on the Chri|&s;tians, of which the de&s;truction of the Work of <HI>Panigra</HI> was none of the lea&s;t: the Vizier &s;uppo&s;ed it a &s;ea&s;onable time to enter into a Treaty by the hand of the Secretary <HI>Giavarina</HI> who was there entertained for that purpo&s;e but he falling &s;ick of the Camp-di&s;temper dyed in a &s;hort time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The deaths of Secre|tary <HI>Gia|varina</HI> and <HI>Padavino.</HI></NOTE> who&s;e death was &s;oon after followed by that of Signior <HI>Padavino,</HI> who fini&s;hed his days at <HI>Canea;</HI> the Plate, Money, and Hou&s;hold-&s;tuff of both were care|fully inventored, and by the ju&s;tice of the Vizier duly accounted for, and admini&s;tred to the Venetians. The In&s;truments of Treaty be|ing thus taken away, the Captain-Pa&s;ha was di&s;patched to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> carrying with him four thou&s;and wounded and &s;ick men, and a Letter to the Grand Signior and Divan, &s;igni|fying his re&s;olutions to win the place, or dye
<PB N="200" REF="102">under the Walls of it; and to that end de&s;ired them to &s;end him &s;uch Recruits of men and &s;upply of Provi&s;ions as were requi&s;ite. He complained of the cowardi&s;e of tho&s;e to whom they had incharged the Convoys; that he wanted both Powder and Bullet, for default of which they could neither ply their great Guns, nor go forward in their Mines; that bread was &s;o dear, that no price could be &s;et to it; that his Souldiers by &s;laughter and &s;ick|ne&s;s did daily dimini&s;h, &s;o that his Army was reduced to twenty three thou&s;and Foot, &s;even hundred Hor&s;e, and two thou&s;and Pioniers; and in fine concluded with urgent in&s;tances to have Recruits of all di&s;peeded to him, without which it was impo&s;&s;ible to gain the Town, or &s;ave him&s;elf. Hereupon Recruits came from all parts, both of Men, Ammunition, and Provi&s;ions, e&s;pecially from the Frontiers or adjacent places, which by &s;uch va&s;t evacuations were almo&s;t di&s;peopled, more particularly in <HI>Albania</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;telnuovo</HI> extraordinary Pre|parations were making both of Men, Hor&s;e, and Camels; and a report was &s;pread, that the Grand Signior intended to pa&s;s over in Per&s;on to <HI>Candia;</HI> but this was &s;oon di&s;proved by his re&s;idence at <HI>Lari&s;&s;a,</HI> where he remained to render a&s;&s;i&s;tance more ea&s;ily, and receive advices more &s;peedily than could be performed at <HI>Adrianople.</HI></P>
<P>Great quantities of Corn were al&s;o &s;ent from divers places, particularly from <HI>Smyrna,</HI> where Engli&s;h, French, and Dutch Ships were taken up for that &s;ervice, to the prejudice of the Trade, and damage of the concerned: &s;ome of which Ve&s;&s;els were taken in their pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Candia,</HI> whil&s;t others arrived in &s;afety through the negligence, as was &s;uppo&s;ed, of the Com|manders at Sea. And indeed the Turks plyed their bu&s;ine&s;s with that indu&s;try and diligence, that notwith&s;tanding the Force which the Venetians <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ad at Sea, their Recruits for the mo&s;t part arrived &s;afe, and Corn began to be &s;o plentiful, that the Vizier gave a prohibition again&s;t having more imported; and in &s;hort, nothing wanted for pro&s;ecution of the War, which was carried on in the Winter, as far as the &s;ea&s;on or the weather would permit; &s;o that &s;carce a day pa&s;&s;ed without &s;omething of action, either of &s;torming or blowing up of Forts, overthrowing Galleries, filling Trenches, the particulars of all which are &s;o numerous, that to recount them would fill a Volume, and are more proper to be related in a Journal than a Hi&s;tory, in which minute matters ought to be pa&s;&s;ed by, and nothing but acts of greate&s;t moment be recorded.</P>
<P>How&s;oever great Actions at this &s;ea&s;on cea&s;ed for a while on one &s;ide and the other, only continual di&s;charges of great &s;hot and Bomboes were practi&s;ed. And the Turks endeavouring with artifice to cover their de|&s;igns, di&s;patched a Letter to the Senate of <HI>Ve|nice</HI> by way of <HI>Suda,</HI> and thence in a Galley to <HI>Candia,</HI> touching certain Motives of Peace, &s;uppo&s;ing that Propo&s;itions and Offers of Ac|commodation would loo&s;en the minds of the Officers, and render them le&s;s intent and dili|gen in their Affairs; on receipt of which Letter, though Marque&s;s <HI>Villa</HI> replied, That he had as much power from the Senate to con|clude a Peace, as the Vizier him&s;elf had from his Ma&s;ter, yet the Vizier would not treat with him, but &s;ent a Letter which was con&s;igned by an Aga at the Bulwark of <HI>Palma</HI> under the caution of a white Flag, de&s;iring that it &s;hould be forwarded to <HI>Venice.</HI> About this time arri|ved to the great comfort of the Be&s;ieged the new Proveditor <HI>Barnardo Nani</HI> with five hundred Souldiers, and <HI>Matteo Matheus</HI> Sergeant General with &s;ome Recruits from the Pope, bringing with him three hundred Medals of Silver to be&s;tow on &s;uch as de&s;erved them, with Jubilees and Indulgences without num|ber, and thus ended the Action of this Year.</P>

<P>THE Spring approaching, toward the end of <HI>January</HI> the Turks full of hopes to compleat their Conque&s;t, vigorou&s;ly in all maritime Ports of the Empire made pro|vi&s;ions of Corn and other Victuals to be &s;ent to the Camp, when occa&s;ion &s;hould require, and opened a door for Jani&s;aries according to the Turki&s;h phra&s;e, the Formality of which is in this manner: The Cheif Officer appointed for that purpo&s;e asks &s;everally &s;uch as come to be li&s;ted, Of what Chamber they de&s;ire to be;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Formality in making Jani&s;aries in the&s;e days:</NOTE> to which they making reply, That they will be of the fifth, &s;ixth, or &s;eventh, or the like, the Officer gives them a blow under the ear with the palm of his hand, and bids them repair to their Chamber, with which they nimbly pa&s;s away. But herein the due form and order of Jani&s;aries was corrupted; for in former days Jani&s;aries were educated in that condition from children, and from thence named <HI>Yeni&s;heri</HI> or <HI>Tyrones,</HI> or the young Souldiery; but now on this nece&s;&s;ity of rai&s;ing Forces, ancient men, Fathers of Families with long beards were ad|mitted, to the di&s;paragement of that Order, and corruption of the exactne&s;s of that Di&s;ci|pline. Con&s;iderable Supplies al&s;o were &s;ent of Beldargees or Pioniers; &s;o that this year from &s;everal parts, according to the be&s;t com|putation, the Forces of <HI>Candia</HI> were recruited with a Supply of &s;eventy thou&s;and men, for tran&s;portation of which and of their Provi&s;ions, all Chri&s;tian Ships were imbarged at <HI>Smyrna</HI> and <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> &s;everal of which in their voyage to <HI>Candia,</HI> were intercepted by the Malte&s;e Cor&s;aires, and particularly a French Ship called the Arms of <HI>France,</HI> on which were be|tween four and five hundred Turks, was taken, and in bording of her about an hundred Turks were killed upon the Deck: &s;ome other &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els (one of which was a Ligorne&s;e under Engli&s;h Colours) were taken the French Barks which had in this manner lo&s;t their Corn, un|advi&s;edly returned to <HI>Smyrna,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing the ex|cu&s;e of having done their endeavours, and of being over-powered by a &s;tronger Force was &s;ufficient: But the Turks who judge of no|thing well, but by the &s;ucce&s;s, having gotten them into their hands, made them not only return their Freight, but &s;atisfie the lo&s;s of the Carga&s;on.</P>
<P>In the Month of <HI>March</HI> the Vizier having intelligence of &s;ix or &s;even Venetian Gallies to be at <HI>Fodile,</HI> not far from <HI>Standia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Fight at Sea.</NOTE> under the Command of the Proveditor of the Armata <HI>Lorenco Cornaro,</HI> gave order to <HI>Regep</HI> Pa&s;ha of <HI>Romelia,</HI> who was Captain of the Souldiery, and <HI>Durach</HI> Begh, who commanded a Squa|dron of twelve Gallies, to weigh Anchor in
<PB N="201" REF="102">the night, and there &s;urpri&s;e them: <HI>Durach</HI> Begh, though &s;ore again&s;t his will, doubting the truth of the report, yet readily obeyed and fitted his Gallies for the Enterpri&s;e. The Captain-General having intelligence of the de&s;ign, prepared four Gallies in Port, and im|barked that night with a French Regiment and &s;ome Italians to the number of &s;ix hun|dred, be&s;ides two Companies of the Guards, and one of the Proveditor <HI>Nam,</HI> under the Command of Colonel <HI>Audr&eacute; Facile</HI> and <HI>Mont|alto,</HI> accompanied al&s;o with the Proveditor Extraordinary <HI>Daniel Ju&s;tiniani,</HI> Commi&s;&s;ary of the Trea&s;ury of the Militia, with &s;everal other Captains and Officers; and arriving at <HI>Sandia,</HI> found the Proveditor General <HI>Cornaro</HI> newly entred there from cru&s;ing the Seas with &s;ixteen Gallies, to whom having communi|cated the de&s;ign, they immediately loo&s;ed from the Port, and arrived at <HI>Fodil&eacute;</HI> before midnight. The Turks having from the place of their Anchorage di&s;covered two Sail, hoped there might be no more, and therefore came forth to fight them; but ingaging farther, met &s;uch a number as evidenced the danger, and the little hope there was in other than in their Courage and Arms. The night being dark, the Venetians not to mi&s;take each other, carried &s;uch great Lights on their Ma&s;t-heads, as not only di&s;tingui&s;hed them from the Ene|my, but al&s;o directed them to give battle to the Turks, which they pro&s;ecuted &s;o home, that they took and &s;unk five of the Turki&s;h Gallies, of which the Admiral commanded by <HI>Durach</HI> Bey was one; the re&s;t, though much &s;hattered, and for the pre&s;ent un&s;erviceable, did yet by the help of their Oars, and the dark|ne&s;s of the night, find a way to e&s;cape: nor was this Victory gained by the Venetians in a Fight of &s;even hours without the lo&s;s of two hundred Souldiers killed, and about five hun|dred wounded, be&s;ides &s;ome Per&s;ons of Quality and Command, <HI>viz</HI> the Cavalier <HI>Ara&s;i Ju&s;tiniani,</HI> the Commi&s;&s;ary <HI>France&s;co Cornaro, Fo&s;ca|rini,</HI> &amp;c. the wounded were <HI>Georgio Greco, Lorenco Bembo,</HI> and <HI>Marco Balbi.</HI> The Turks lo&s;t many of their be&s;t Sea-men and Souldiers, be&s;ides Slaves and others, counting on every Galley one with another three hundred per&s;ons; among&s;t the Pri&s;oners which amounted to four hundred and ten, the Beys of <HI>Cyprus</HI> and <HI>Navarine</HI> with <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> of <HI>Anatolia,</HI> and the Chiaus of the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Aleppo</HI> were taken, to|gether with eleven hundred Chri&s;tian Slaves who were all freed, on condition that they &s;hould &s;erve the Summer following in the Ve|netian Armata. Of the Turks were &s;lain <HI>Durach</HI> Bey, the Bey of <HI>Coron,</HI> and <HI>Ha&s;tam</HI> formerly Bey of <HI>Coron.</HI> The Great Vizier from the Camp could all the time behold the fla&s;hes of the &s;mall and great &s;hot, and by help of the Ve|netian Lights perceive the &s;ucce&s;s of his own Fleet, not an&s;werable to his expectation. What lo&s;s the Turks &s;u&s;tained with Slaves and Souldiers is incertain, only an hundred Chri|&s;tian Slaves were relea&s;ed, and four hundred Turks captivated, and among&s;t the &s;lain was <HI>Durach</HI> Bey him&s;elf, a &s;tout Sea-man, and a known Pirate, who from a &s;mall Brigantine had rai&s;ed him&s;elf to be Begh of the <HI>Morea,</HI> and to command four or five Gallies of his own. In like manner, and not long after, a Squadron of Venetian Ships were forced by &s;torm in the night to anchor under Cape <HI>Spada,</HI> where accidentally &s;ix Turki&s;h Gallies were riding. The Sky being very dark and clo&s;e, the fir&s;t Ship ran foul of a Galley, and &s;o &s;hat|tered and cru&s;hed her &s;ides, that being ready to &s;ink, the Turks for&s;ook her, and run aboard the Ship to &s;ave a life which was to be afterwards mi&s;erable and &s;lavi&s;h. The others affrighted at the arrival of the&s;e unexpected gue&s;ts, flipt their Cables to &s;eek harbour in a tempe&s;tuous Sea; but the weather being too boi&s;terous for Gallies, one of them was ca&s;t away, and about an hundred and &s;eventy men lo&s;t: the news hereof being brought to <HI>Venice</HI> by Colonel <HI>Vecthia</HI> with the En&s;igns and Spoils taken from the Enemy, the Senate be&s;towed the honour of Knighthood on the Captain-General, comforting the families of the &s;lain and wounded with &s;ignal marks of Honour and Glory.</P>
<P>The Captain Pa&s;ha put this year to Sea more early than was u&s;ual, de&s;igning to make as many Voyages to <HI>Candia</HI> as was po&s;&s;ible, with Succours both of Men and Am|munition; his de&s;ign and work was wholly to avoid the Venetians, and to &s;teal a&s;hore his Recruits; to which end he made &s;uch expedi|tion in every Voyage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;ucce&s;s of the Turks at Sea.</NOTE> that &s;carce could the Chri&s;tians have advice of his arrival in any part of the I&s;le of <HI>Candia,</HI> before he was well forwarded in his return: yet his ha&s;te was not &s;o great, but one time having fifty three Gal|lies in his Company, he adventured to look into the Port of <HI>Nio,</HI> where he met four Cor|&s;aires or Free-booters under Ma&s;te&s;e Colours, commanded by two Brothers <HI>Themericort,</HI> and by the Knights <HI>Verva</HI> and <HI>Bremant:</HI> two of the Ships were on the Careen wa&s;hing and tallow|ing their Ve&s;&s;els, whil&s;t the other two, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Themericort</HI> Brothers were on the Guard, being at anchor in the narrowe&s;t entrance to the Harbour. The Turks &s;uppo&s;ed at fir&s;t, that &s;o formidable an appearance of their Fleet would affright the Chri&s;tians to a Surrender, rather than to contend on tho&s;e unequal terms. But it &s;eems the Cor&s;aires were more re&s;olute than was imagined; for no &s;ooner did the Turks approach, than the Chri&s;tians di&s;charged their Cannon and Vollies of &s;mall &s;hot &s;o plentifully, as cau&s;ed the Gallies to di&s;pute at a farther di&s;tance, where &s;hooting as it were at rovers with their long Ca&s;hee Pieces (not ad|venturing to come to a nearer Fight) for the &s;pace of eight hours made (as reported) about eight thou&s;and &s;hot, with little or no execution; &s;o that the Captain-Pa&s;ha made his &s;ign of Retreat, and for&s;ook the Engagement, as be|ing too dangereous and difficult an Enterpri&s;e. But better &s;ucce&s;s had the Turks the next month at Sea again&s;t Captain <HI>Georgio,</HI> an old and &s;ubtle Pirate, who for many years had vex|ed and pillaged, not only the Turks, but Chri|&s;tians on all I&s;les of the <HI>Archipelago:</HI> great for|tune he had in taking Turki&s;h Saiks and Ve&s;&s;els; and &s;ome of them con&s;iderably rich, and when that prey failed him, or was &s;carce, he pur&s;ued his game on the &s;hore, from whence he often carried men, women, and children into &s;la|very, and oft-times had the fortune of con&s;i|derable Booty. The I&s;lands which lay open and ungarded were his common Rendezvous, where the men attended his &s;ervice, and the women his lu&s;t. In this manner the Pirate pa&s;&s;ed for &s;everal years, have obtained unto him&s;elf a fame and terror with the Turks,
<PB N="202" REF="103">and riches at home: the place which he com|monly cho&s;e to wa&s;h and tallow his Ve&s;&s;els, was among&s;t certain &s;mall I&s;les in the Bay of <HI>Edremit,</HI> anciently <HI>Adrimetum,</HI> oppo&s;ite unto <HI>Mytilene,</HI> from whence he had as from a Thicket or Wood a view of &s;uch Ve&s;&s;els as pa&s;&s;ed the great Road towards <HI>Con&s;tantinople:</HI> the&s;e frequent &s;ucce&s;&s;es rendred him &s;o confi|dent and &s;ecure, that he &s;till continued his &s;tation, notwith&s;tanding the Turki&s;h Naval Forces, which in the Summer &s;ea&s;on made their Rendezvous at <HI>Scio.</HI> But at length the Captain-Pa&s;ha with the whole Turki&s;h Ar|mata being at <HI>Scio,</HI> and with him three Ships of <HI>Tripoli,</HI> advice came that Captain <HI>Georgio</HI> had not for&s;aken his little I&s;les, but was there careening his &s;mall Fleet which con&s;i&s;ted of two Ships and a Brigantine: hereupon the Tripo|le&s;es were commanded out to encounter the Enemy, whom the next day they found &s;o &s;ecure and negligent, that he di&s;covered not his Foes before they were ready to attaque him. The Captain Pa&s;ha al&s;o fearing that the Tripo|le&s;es were not of &s;ufficient Force to encounter &s;o valiant and experienced a Commander, both to make the Enterprize the more ea&s;ie and certain, and to gain the reputation of that bu&s;i|ne&s;s to him&s;elf, went out in per&s;on with all his Gallies. The Tripole&s;es had began to fire on Captain <HI>Georgio</HI> before the Pa&s;ha came in to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but it falling calm, and the Ships not able to joyn in a nearer fight, gave way for the Gallies, which being above fifty in number, overpowered the Chri&s;tians on all &s;ides; how&s;oever, the two Ships defended them|&s;elves again&s;t all this Force, until the Captain him&s;elf being killed, his own Ship &s;urrendred, but &s;o &s;hattered, that &s;he was &s;carce able to &s;wim above water.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Captain <HI>Georgio</HI> taken by the <HI>Turks.</HI></NOTE> This Ship being over|&s;ome, the Turks boarded the other, com|manded by Captain <HI>de Le&s;ca&s;es,</HI> who &s;eeing no remedy to avoid being taken, he leaped into his Boat, and blew up his Ship; how&s;oever could not e&s;cape his de&s;tiny, for having his Arm broke, he became a prey and a &s;lave to his Enemy.</P>
<P>The News of this Victory was celebrated with &s;o much the more joy, by how much this per&s;on was feared and hated, and was not only a &s;ubject of rejoycing to the Turks, but al&s;o to the Chri&s;tians, who&s;e Parents and Rela|tions this Cor&s;aire had pillaged and en&s;laved; &s;o that the Inhabitants of the <HI>Archipelago</HI> for the mo&s;t part were plea&s;ed with the revenge, and promi&s;ed more &s;ecurity and quietne&s;s to their open Coa&s;ts. With no le&s;s triumph was this News po&s;ted to the Grand Signior, who rewarded the Me&s;&s;enger with two thou&s;and Dollars gratuity, and cau&s;ed demon&s;trations of joy to be made through the whole Court; &s;o dreadful was grown the Name of &s;o incon&s;ide|rable a per&s;on, in re&s;pect of the greatne&s;s of the Ottoman Empire.</P>
<P>But the &s;ucce&s;s of this advantage did not heighten the courage of the Captain Pa&s;ha to that pitch, as to make him more bold with the Venetian Armata; for in the month of <HI>July</HI> having great Recruits of Men and Provi|&s;ions to land, and hearing that the Venetians lay before <HI>Canea,</HI> having fortified a Rock, called St. <HI>Todoro,</HI> at the mouth of that Port, he re|&s;olved for <HI>Retimo;</HI> but pur&s;uits, or intelli|gence of the Enemies being in the way, or his own fears &s;till prevented him, until at length he was forced to <HI>Gira-Petra,</HI> a &s;mall and ob|&s;cure place, far di&s;tant from the City of <HI>Candia,</HI> and the way thither by land rocky, and al|mo&s;t unpa&s;&s;able for Bea&s;ts of Burden; how&s;o|ever, the Men and Ammunition were there landed with that ha&s;te and expedition, that in le&s;s than thirty hours time the Captain Pa&s;ha was again upon his return for <HI>Scio,</HI> leaving the Souldiery, and the Ammunition he had di&s;|barked to find a pa&s;&s;age through the Rocks and Mountains: At which the Vizier was &s;o di&s;plea&s;ed, that he &s;ent the Captain Pa&s;ha this Me&s;&s;age, That the next time he &s;hould for|bear to bring farther &s;upplies, until he could find a more commodious Port wherein to land them.</P>
<P>In this manner the Marine Affairs pa&s;&s;ed this year at Sea, the Turki&s;h Fleet having, be&s;ides other &s;uccours, tran&s;ported <HI>Ibrahim</HI> Pa&s;ha of <HI>Dama&s;cus</HI> with eight hundred Spahees unto <HI>Candia,</HI> whom we mentioned formerly to have been Pa&s;ha of Grand <HI>Cairo,</HI> and married to the Grand Signior's Si&s;ter; and being one with whom I had a former acquaintance, and who was a great friend to the Engli&s;h Nation, I made him a vi&s;it as he pa&s;&s;ed through <HI>Smyrna.</HI></P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e matters were tran&s;acting at Sea, on the <HI>7th</HI> of <HI>January</HI> arrived the new Provedi|tor General <HI>Bernardo Nani,</HI> and Sergeant Ge|neral <HI>Muteo Matei</HI> with five hundred Foot, &s;ent by the Pope, who gave Licence for de&s;truction of &s;ome Mona&s;teries, who&s;e Orders were judged le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary in the Venetian State, that their Revenue might be applied to the &s;ervice of this War; after Arrival of which &s;uccours, a ge|neral Mu&s;ter was made of the whole Garri&s;on, and the number thereof reckoned to amount unto eight thou&s;and fighting Men; though &s;oon afterwards continual action and exploits of War decimated the number, and many of the brave Commanders being taken off, every tenth man peri&s;hed, and rendred the place in a condition which required continual &s;upplies.</P>
<P>For many and various were the attempts and actions performed on both &s;ides under the Walls of <HI>Candia;</HI> and fir&s;t the Turks began to make appear a Battery which they had rai&s;ed on the &s;ide of the <HI>Lazaretto,</HI> which &s;o offended tho Port, that there was no harbour or acce&s;s for Ve&s;&s;els. On the contrary to which, by the Fort of St. <HI>Andrea</HI> another Battery was rai&s;ed, which offended <HI>Tramata</HI> very much, which was another &s;mall harbour, capable only to receive Boats or Barks; the pa&s;&s;age to which was &s;o annoyed now by the Enemies Cannon, that no Ve&s;&s;el could go in or out, unle&s;s in the Night, and that too with &s;ome difficulty and danger.</P>
<P>The Turks gaining advantage on the &s;ide of St. <HI>Andrea,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Turks re&s;olve to make their pa&s;&s;age by St <HI>Andrea.</HI></NOTE> applied their whole &s;trength and diligence to that part; and one dark Night pa&s;&s;ing undi&s;covered along the Seas, they &s;ilent|ly fixed a Cord to the Pali&s;ade of St. <HI>Andrea,</HI> and with an Engine &s;trained it &s;o violently, that they tore away &s;everal of the main Stakes of the Work without being perceived by the Centinels, who paid for that neglect with the price of their lives; upon which &s;ucce&s;s they continued to advance their lines on that &s;ide, which Marque&s;s <HI>Villa</HI> perceiving, re&s;olved to hinder by &s;ome valiant &s;allies.

This &s;ucce&s;s gave the be&s;ieged opportunity to fini&s;h their Platforms which they had rai&s;ed on the &s;ide of the Ditch adjoining to the Bulwark of St. <HI>Andrea,</HI> on which they planted two pieces of Cannon which carried fifty pound Bullet a piece; which much di&s;turbed the Enemies Traver&s;es: How&s;oever, the Turks with indefatigable pains, and invincible patience battered the little Tower of <HI>Priuli,</HI> the Curtain, and Revelin of St. <HI>Andrea,</HI> and employed all their power and at|tention to fill the Ditch with Faggots, Earth and other Rubbi&s;h.</P>

<P>I cannot adventure to a&s;&s;ign the rea&s;ons that might induce the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> to recal the worthy Governour from this glorious action. Some &s;ay, that tho&s;e who were emulous of his glory procured his revocation; Others, that the Marque&s;s him&s;elf de&s;ired it;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cau&s;es of Marque&s;s <HI>Villa</HI>'s de|parture.</NOTE> and that finding the Forces of the Town to decline, and the Turks to encroach and penetrate daily into the innermo&s;t parts of &s;trength, he was de&s;irous, after &s;o long a Siege, to return with untainted glory; or perhaps weary of a Siege &s;o tedious and perilous, he might de&s;ire to retire, having performed &s;ufficient already in his own per&s;on, and enough to make all Chri&s;tendom his Debtors and Admirers. So that I cannot but reproach tho&s;e tongues and pens, which in report and writings attribute the cau&s;e of Mar|que&s;s <HI>Villa</HI>'s retirement to certain ju&s;t occa&s;ions of di&s;content given him by the Captain Gene|ral <HI>France&s;co Moro&s;ini,</HI> who, envious of his Fame and actions, and unwilling to have a con&s;hater with him in his honours, did u&s;ually thwart his Coun&s;els and Propo&s;als; and more particularly contemned a Redoubt which Mar|que&s;s <HI>Villa</HI> had built, and of which he had a &s;ingular e&s;teem. Yet that <HI>Moro&s;ini</HI> might evi|dence the un&s;ufficiency thereof, 'tis reported that he wrote a Letter to the Vizier, to a&s;&s;ault that Redoubt; for if he did, he promi&s;ed to afford him opportunity to take it, by with|drawing all Forces from thence; which Letter it is &s;aid, was betrayed to Marque&s;s <HI>Villa,</HI> and brought to his hands, which he with great pru|dence and moderation di&s;&s;embled until the hour of his departure, and then produced it to the a&s;toni&s;hment and &s;hame of <HI>Moro&s;ini.</HI> To this particular I give the le&s;s belief, be|cau&s;e I find it wrote in a Journal of this Seige by a per&s;on who was a great Favourer of the French, and willing to &s;hare the intire glory to that Nation, and the mi&s;carriages to the Italian. What&s;oever might be the motive to Marque&s;s <HI>Villa</HI> to per&s;wade his return, is un|certain; how&s;oever, it is reported, that being arrived at <HI>Zant</HI> in his way to <HI>Venice;</HI> and there meeting a &s;trong Convoy bound for <HI>Candia,</HI> with recruits of Men, and plenty of provi&s;ions, he conceived new thoughts of the greatne&s;s of the Republick; and beholding al&s;o with what vigour and vigilance they attended to the con|&s;ervation of that place, he began to te&s;tifie &s;ome remor&s;e and di&s;&s;atisfaction for having abandoned a Charge which rendred his Fame great through the World; and the continua|tion of which labours being crowned with that &s;ucce&s;s which his courage and conduct merited, might have brought a Ble&s;&s;ing to all Chri&s;ten|dom, and perpetuated his honour and glory to all po&s;terity.

<P>The Senate, that they might te&s;tifie the e&s;teem they entertained of the per&s;on of Marque&s;s <HI>Villa,</HI> pre&s;ented him with a Ba&s;on of Gold valued at &s;ix thou&s;and Ducats, together with a Patent recounting at large the many famous Exploits which he had performed in their Ser|vice, which they expre&s;&s;ed with a &s;tile &s;o ge|nerous and obliging, as may &s;erve for a Record to tran&s;mit the Fame of his Merits to all Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>Marque&s;s <HI>Villa</HI> being departed from <HI>Candia,</HI> the Captain-General recalled all his Forces from divers parts of the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> which he had &s;ent thither with the Soldiers wounded in the la&s;t Battle; and being returned, they brought with them great numbers of Pioniers and Work|men to labour in the Fortifications and Mines: at the &s;ame time al&s;o the Captain-Pa&s;ha arrived at <HI>Canea,</HI> bringing two thou&s;and Jani&s;aries with him.</P>
<P>The Marque&s;s St. <HI>Andrea Monthrun,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Marque&s;s St. <HI>An|drea</HI> vi&s;its the Works.</NOTE> a Gen|tleman of the French Nation, was tran&s;ported to <HI>Candia</HI> by the General Proveditor <HI>Cornaro,</HI> where being entred into the Charge and Office of Marque&s;s <HI>Villa,</HI> wanted nothing of the vi|gilance and circum&s;pection of his Predece&s;&s;our. And therefore in the fir&s;t place having vi&s;ited all the Forts, Out-works, and Retrenchments of the Town, ordered what was nece&s;&s;ary for repair of the breaches, and amended what was deficient in the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Fortifications. And though the Turks fired a Mine the <HI>22th</HI> of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> at the point of the Fort St. <HI>Andrea,</HI> which made a mo&s;t dangerous breach; yet it was &s;o valiantly defended, and &s;o &s;peedily repair|ed, that the Enemy gained little or no advan|tage, and all by the extraordinary diligence of this Marque&s;s St. <HI>Andrea,</HI> who pa&s;&s;ed whole months without uncloathing him&s;elf; and as his nights were without &s;leep, &s;o his days con|&s;umed without repo&s;e, applying him&s;elf per&s;o|nally to all places where was mo&s;t of danger, e&s;|pecially at the Fort of St. <HI>Andrea,</HI> where he took up his con&s;tant Quarters.</P>
<P>The Turksnow daily pre&s;&s;ing the Town more nearly than before, Skirmi&s;hes and Sallies were more frequent and more bloody; &s;o that a|bout this time the Proveditor General <HI>Bernardo Nani</HI> applying him&s;elf with all earne&s;tne&s;s in the performance of his Charge, was &s;lain by a Musket-&s;hot in his head; his death was much lamented by all, being a Gentleman who was born (as may be &s;aid) in the Fleet, having had his Education there, and pa&s;&s;ed his youth in Wars and dangers for the &s;afety and honour of his Country. <HI>Girolamo Bataglia</HI> was elected by the Republick to &s;ucceed him in the Office, who&s;e death was al&s;o &s;econded by that of <HI>Fran|ce&s;co Bataglia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> Brother of the Duke of <HI>Can|dia,</HI> being &s;hot in the brea&s;t with a Musket-bul|let; and though he was &s;ent thither to admini|&s;ter Ju&s;tice to the People, yet his zeal and cou|rage carrying him to Martial Acts beyond his duty, made a grave for him among&s;t the other Heroes and Worthies of that place.</P>
<P>The Turk, approaching daily nearer with their Works, infe&s;ted very much the pa&s;&s;age of Ve&s;&s;els to the Town, and &s;hot &s;o directly into the Port, that no Ship, Galley, or Bark could remain in any &s;ecurity from their Cannon; to remedy which, a &s;mall Redoubt was rai&s;ed at <HI>Tramata,</HI> which being well and &s;trongly fortified

<P>When the&s;e Per&s;ons of Honour and Courage arrived at <HI>Candia,</HI> they found the City hardly be&s;et, and reduced to a &s;trait and difficult con|dition; for the Turks were advanced &s;o near to the Fort of St. <HI>Andrea,</HI> that the Souldiers with|in and without could cro&s;s their Muskets, and reach Tobaco one to the other: how&s;oever this breach was &s;o well repaired with a good Pali&s;|&s;ado fortified with &s;everal Bonnets, and a double Retrenchment on the Ba&s;tion, it &s;elf, and a third Retrenchment of &s;quared &s;tone with|al, that the courage of the Be&s;ieged being no|thing abated by the many and furious a&s;&s;aults of the Enemy, the Town &s;till remained in a de|fen&s;ible po&s;ture, and &s;till capable with good Suc|cours and Supplies to yield matter of imploy|ment for &s;everal years to the Ottoman Forces. The&s;e worthy Champions, as I &s;aid, being arri|ved, moved with the &s;en&s;e of Religion, and de&s;ire of glory to them&s;elves, challenged the priviledge of mounting the Guard of St. <HI>Andrea;</HI> but that being already prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Knights of <HI>Malta</HI> and other Officers of the place, was refu&s;ed to them. How&s;oever the Captain-General <HI>Moro&s;ini</HI> was plea&s;ed to gratifie them with the Guard of a &s;mall Chapel over that Ba&s;tion on the right hand of the breach, a place of no le&s;s danger, and there|fore of no le&s;s honour than the other; with which the Cavaliers being &s;atisfied, Mon|&s;ieur St. <HI>Paul</HI> mounted the Guard one day at &s;ix a clock in the morning, and continued there until the &s;ame hour of the day following; during which time he lo&s;t his Major <HI>Dupre</HI> and Mon&s;ieur <HI>De Marenval,</HI> the latter of which had his brains knocked out with &s;o violent a blow of a great &s;hot, that &s;ome pieces of his skull dangerou&s;ly wounded the Sieurs <HI>De Chamilly</HI> and <HI>De Lare,</HI> who were near to him: and more maliciou&s;ly did the Turks ply the &s;tations of the&s;e new-come Gue&s;ts than any others, throw|ing Bomboes, Granadoes, Stink-pots, and other &s;orts of artificial Fire without ce&s;&s;ation into their Quarters, notwith&s;tanding which, this young Prince and Mon&s;ieur <HI>La Fueillade</HI> expo&s;ed them|&s;elves like common Souldiers, animating their men more with their example than their words.</P>
<P>And now by this time by &s;o many Works and removals of Earth, by &s;o many Traver&s;es and Mines under ground, and throwing up the caverns and bowels of the Earth into the Air, the &s;oil became &s;o brittle, crumbling, and as it were &s;andy, and like a&s;hes, that it &s;eemed not capable longer enduring of the Pick-ax or the Shovel, and was &s;o porous, that the light of &s;ome Mines glimmering into the others Traver|&s;es, ea&s;ily di&s;covered each others Mines, where|by it became equally a trade and cu&s;tom to &s;teal Powder.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chri|&s;tians over|throw a battery of the Turks.</NOTE> How&s;oever the Venetians &s;o clo&s;ely worked with tho&s;e Props and Arts, that they formed a con&s;iderable Mine, which on the fir&s;t of <HI>December</HI> they &s;prang with &s;o much &s;ucce&s;s, that they wholly overthrew a Battery of the Turks directed again&s;t St. <HI>Andrea,</HI> and buried all their Cannon.</P>

<PB N="206" REF="105">the Souldiery, that like men conducted by miracle, they broke through the gro&s;s Bo|dy of the Enemies Force: and &s;o violent they were in their combate, and &s;o intent to their bu&s;ine&s;s, that they neither ob&s;erved the multi|tudes of the Enemy which came upon them, nor the &s;ignal of their Commander for a Re|treat; until at length di&s;covering their danger, they made &s;peed with &s;ome di&s;order to return, having lo&s;t an hundred and twenty Gentlemen in this rencounter, who&s;e heads being cut off (as the cu&s;tom of the Turks is) were pitched up|on the Pikes end, and ranked before the door of the Viziers Tent, among&s;t which the head of the Marque&s;s <HI>Doradour</HI> did beyond all the others draw the eyes of the Turks, who admired the clearne&s;s of his complexion, and fairne&s;s of the hair; which being breaded in tre&s;&s;es for the more convenience in fighting, made death it &s;elf beautiful, and was at the &s;ame time both his Enemies glory and their compa&s;&s;ion. The French having thus evaporated their fury with this Phlebotomy, there not remaining above two hundred and thirty after this Sally of all tho&s;e &s;ix hundred brought into <HI>Candia,</HI> Mon|&s;ieur <HI>La Fueillade</HI> with his reliques departed: at which time the whole &s;trength of the Town con|&s;i&s;ted of about &s;even thou&s;and &s;tranger Souldi|ers, four thou&s;and Inhabitants, and two thou|&s;and Savoyards, which was too weak a Garri&s;on to re&s;i&s;t &s;o potent an Enemy, &s;o formally and &s;trongly incamped, unle&s;s &s;upplied with new Re|cruits.

Their General Count <HI>Waldeck</HI> whil&s;t he undauntedly incouraged his men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Count <HI>Waldeck</HI> dyes of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ounds.</NOTE> and openly expo&s;ed him|&s;elf on the Works, received a mortal wound, of which &s;oon afterwards he dyed; but be|fore he expired, he a&s;&s;embled together his Fellow Souldiers, and incouraged them in the Holy cau&s;e they were come to maintain, giving them as a Farwel-Sermon, in&s;tructions, and per&s;wa&s;ive arguments to a godly life, and having confe&s;&s;ed his owns &s;ins in the pre&s;ence of them all, he re&s;igned his &s;pirit into the hands of his Creator, leaving not only his own Forces, but the whole Town di&s;con&s;olate for the lo&s;s of &s;o able a Commander.</P>
<P>And now the time of year approaching, where|in the Town expected its ultimate Relief, and the Union of all the Princes of Chri&s;tendom for rai&s;ing the Siege, which had continued for the &s;pace now of about two years; the valiant Chri|&s;tians full of hopes, daily animated each other, ca&s;ting their eyes to Sea-ward, promi&s;ed a re|ward to the fir&s;t De&s;cryer of the long de&s;ired Fleet. The Turks al&s;o being advi&s;ed of the expected Succours, re&s;olved if po&s;&s;ible to per|form the bu&s;ine&s;s de&s;igned before their arrival; and thereupon made one of the greate&s;t a&s;&s;aults that ever was yet given to the Town, in which though the Chri&s;tians behaved them&s;elves with all valour imaginable, yet the Turks &s;till gain|ed farther footing and advantage. And now it fared with the Town after every &s;torm, as it doth with a phy&s;ical body after every acce&s;&s;ion of a Feaver, which though it intermits for &s;ome time, yet it leaves the Patient always more weak and debilitated than before. Wherefore the Chri&s;tians increa&s;ing in care and diligence, the Captain-General di&s;armed &s;everal of his Gallies to &s;upply the Town with what Force he could po&s;&s;ibly contribute, and the Engineers imployed their brains for de&s;truction of the Enemy, &s;o that they fell again to their Mines, and &s;prang one which took good effect; &s;oon after they &s;prang &s;even others, after which four more near the Revelin of St. <HI>Spirito,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Mine of an hundred and &s;ixty Sacks of Powder fired by the Chri|ans.</NOTE> which blew up many Turks, ruined their Lodgings, and buried one of their Batteries: the&s;e al&s;o were followed by another Mine of an hundred and &s;ixty Sacks of Powder, which took its way between St. <HI>Andrea</HI> and the Revelin of St. <HI>Spi|rito</HI> with extraordinary execution and violence, throwing up that va&s;t quantity of Earth and Timber, that it not only overwhelmed the Enemy in the neighbouring Trenches, but over|threw a Battery of three Pieces of Cannon, which the Turks had rai&s;ed on the Revelin of St. <HI>Andrea:</HI> yet all this &s;erved to increa&s;e the heat and fury of the Enemy rather than abate it; for they imagining this to be the ultimate force and the la&s;t bla&s;t of the expiring Fortre&s;s, plyed their a&s;&s;aults with the more fury and madne&s;s, pre&s;&s;ing forward the crowds of the Souldiery collected lately in Villages, and the Jani&s;aries newly created taken from the Plough to be matter and fuel for the Chri&s;tians Powder.</P>
<P>Winter now approaching, and the Vizier re&s;olving to quarter a &s;econd year under the Walls of <HI>Candia,</HI> began to provide again&s;t the weather, and re&s;olved to lye &s;till until the Spring &s;hould renew the time for action, but never intermitted his imployment of plying con|&s;tantly his Batteries, and &s;hooting Bomboes into the Town. In the mean time the Be&s;ieg|ed being animated by their new additional Forces, who&s;e &s;pirits al&s;o were high, and de|&s;irous of action; the Commanders thought it not policy to &s;uppre&s;s the heat and mettle of their courage at the beginning, but gave way to the Souldiers propo&s;ition of a Sally, which was effected in the month of <HI>December</HI> with no bad &s;ucce&s;s.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chri|stians &s;ally on the &s;ide of <HI>Sabio|nera.</HI></NOTE> For the Chri&s;tians &s;urpri&s;ing the Turks unawares, little dreaming of any &s;uch de&s;ign, fell in among&s;t them on the &s;ide of <HI>Sa|bionera,</HI> where they took a Battery, di&s;mount|ed and &s;piked the Cannon, with the lo&s;s of the Duke of <HI>Candia,</HI> being &s;hot in the brea&s;t with a Musket-bullet; of the Turks near three thou&s;and were killed, among&s;t whom was <HI>Benglee</HI> the <HI>Samp&s;ongiba&s;hee</HI> or Major General of the Jani&s;aries, and <HI>Katirgi Ogl&eacute;</HI> Pa&s;ha of <HI>Canea,</HI> whom we have already mentioned, and &s;o returned with Triumph into the Town.

<HEAD>The State of Affairs in the Turki&s;h Court, and other Parts of the Empire during the War in <HI>CANDIA.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BUT whil&s;t we are in relation of the Wars abroad, we mu&s;t not forget the proceedings of Affairs at home. The Grand Signior now weary of his repo&s;e and aboad in his Seraglio at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> and impatient of the delays in his Affairs at <HI>Candia,</HI> judged it as well agreeable to the pre|&s;ent convenience of his Empire, as to his own humour, to &s;eat him&s;elf in &s;ome place of nearer di&s;tance from <HI>Candia,</HI> than his pre&s;ent ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">ad; from whence by his pre&s;ence and au|thority, his Army might with better expedi|tion be &s;upplied with all nece&s;&s;aries of War and provi&s;ion. After various Arguments about the choice of the place, <HI>Lari&s;&s;a</HI> was fixed upon, a City anciently renowned for Antiquity and Plenty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Female Court &s;ent to <HI>Con&s;tan|tinople.</HI></NOTE> And that the Court might not abound with unnece&s;&s;ary Attendants; the Queen Mo|ther, and <HI>Ha&s;aki</HI> Sultana, with all the Ladies of their Retinue, were &s;ent to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> a policy perhaps to amu&s;e the minds of the people, and afford them an occa&s;ion of di&s;|cour&s;e, and hopes that the Grand Signior him|&s;elf might &s;hortly follow: But before the de|parture of this Female Court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Jani|&s;aries jea|lous of the &s;afety of the Sultans Brothers.</NOTE> the di&s;po&s;al of the Grand Signior's Brothers was moved and que&s;tioned by the Jani&s;aries, who having long &s;ince been jealous and doubtful of their &s;afety, did demand, that the protection and cu&s;tody of them &s;hould be committed to the Queen Mother; who willingly received the Charge, and gave &s;ecurity by Hoget to defend and pre|&s;erve them from all private Treachery, or publick Attempts with the &s;ame tenderne&s;s and care as &s;he &s;hould her own life, or the life of her Son. In this manner the&s;e Princes and Prince&s;&s;es departing, made a &s;olemn and mag|nificent entrance into <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> The chief of the Cavalcade was <HI>Kul-ogli,</HI> the Grand Signiors Mo&s;ayp, or Favourite, attended with a hundred and fifty Pages in Coats of Male, and Satten Ve&s;ts; in one Coach was the <HI>Valed&egrave;</HI> Sultana, or the Queen Mother, in the next was the <HI>Ha&s;aki</HI> Sultana, or the Grand Signior's Queen, in the third were the Bro|thers, in the fourth was the young Prince, or the Grand Signior's Son, after came the Coaches of more ordinary Ladies attended with about a hundred and fifty black Eunuchs, in Ve&s;ts of white Satten.</P>
<P>The Grand Signior al&s;o preparing for his journey to <HI>Lari&s;&s;a,</HI> pitched his Tents without the City; from whence one day viewing round the Camp from a Jardac, or Tent, elevated above the re&s;t, he e&s;pied with a Pro&s;pective Gla&s;s a certain per&s;on taking Tobacco in his Tent, whil&s;t a Slave rubbed his Legs: His At|tendants not able or willing upon his Demands to inform him who he was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Grand Signior di&s;plea&s;ed with To|bacco.</NOTE> he &s;ent an Officer to make Enquiry, who returned with An&s;wer, that it was <HI>Ibrihim</HI> Aga, the Kahya or Steward to the Chimacam, and in effect Chimacam

<P>The Sultan being arrived at <HI>Lari&s;&s;a,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">An Amba&s;|&s;ador &s;ent from <HI>Ve|nice.</HI></NOTE> News came of the near approach of the Excellenti&s;&s;i|mo <HI>Alvi&s;e de Molino,</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador from the Venetian Republick, with propo&s;itions of peace. But the Turks before they would admit the Emba&s;&s;y, or the per&s;on which brought it, to a nearer approach than a Days Journey from the Court, would be re&s;olved fir&s;t whether he brought with him the Keys of <HI>Candia;</HI> To which it was replied by the Interpreter, That he was not able to give them &s;atisfaction in that particular, being but a mean and ordinary &s;ervant, to whom the Secrets of State, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nd re&s;olutions of great men were not committed; his Office being only to render faithfully the words and &s;ence of his Ma&s;ters, and not to enter into the private thoughts and Cabinet of their Coun&s;els. To which the Chimacam proudly and barbarou&s;ly made an&s;wer, Go tell thy Ma&s;ter, that unle&s;s he brings the Keys of <HI>Candia,</HI> thy head &s;hall pay for it. And that he pre&s;ume not in per&s;on to approach nearer unto this Court. So the Amba&s;&s;adour re|mained at a di&s;tance for &s;ome weeks, and at length was transferred over to the Vizier at <HI>Candia;</HI> who being more ready to hearken to propo&s;itions, in hopes by &s;ome overture or other to hook in <HI>Candia,</HI> gave an ea&s;ie Audi|ence to the Amba&s;&s;ador, and controverted &s;everal Articles and Propo&s;itions with all free|dom and patience. So that on the Venetians part, the Surrender of <HI>Suda</HI> was offered, and a Sum of mony, in compen&s;ation of the War. The Vizier on the other &s;ide would be conten|ted with nothing le&s;s than the Surrender of <HI>Candia;</HI> and in lieu thereof to grant a Licence to rebuild <HI>Paleo-Ca&s;tro,</HI> an ancient Fortre&s;s. But the Fortre&s;s it &s;elf of <HI>Candia</HI> being the prize and aim of both, nothing could be con|cluded without that; &s;o that, the Amba&s;&s;ador in fine, declared plainly, That the City of <HI>Candia</HI> was maintained and defended by the Arms of Foreign Princes, without who&s;e con|&s;ent it could not be re&s;igned; all the re&s;t of the I&s;land &s;hould be the reward of their bloud and labour, only <HI>Candia</HI> was capable of no Conditions, but what were impo&s;ed on it by force of Arms.</P>
<P>The Vizier, who&s;e honour could be &s;alved, and the glory of the Ottoman Empire main|tained, at no other rate than the &s;ubjection of <HI>Candia,</HI> would hearken to no other terms or propo&s;als; &s;o that the Treaty broke off, and the Amba&s;&s;adour returned to <HI>Canea,</HI> there to remain until farther Overtures of an Accomo|dation &s;hould pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>It was now towards the depth of Winter when three men of War and a Fire-Ship,<NOTE PLACE="marg">French Ships of W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">r &s;ail to <HI>Con|&s;tanti|nople.</HI></NOTE> &s;ent by the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, &s;teered up the Helle&s;pont with words and boa&s;tings as full of Wind as their Sails; and being arrived at <HI>Con|&s;tantinople,</HI> vaunting of their Force, as if &s;uffi|cient to &s;ubdue the Turki&s;h Dominions, they uttered certain rumors, that they were come to revenge the late affront offered to their Mer|chants, to cau&s;e that mony to be repaid, which in late and frequent Avanias had been extorted from their Nation; and to renew their Capi|tulations with more advantageous terms. As namely, That their Cu&s;toms from 5 b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> re|duced to 3 <HI>per Cent.</HI> as the Engli&s;h, Dutch, and Genoe&s;es pay. That their King be treated by the Sultan with the equal Pre&s;ents and Gifts, according to the Cu&s;tom u&s;ed with the Empe|ror; and that at all times interchangeably Am|ba&s;&s;adors be &s;ent to re&s;ide in each others Do|minions; with other propo&s;itions which &s;eem|ed as extravagant to the Turks, as they ap|peared to others vain, and to have no founda|tion but in the report of the Vulgar.</P>
<P>But that which was reported by the mo&s;t ju|dicious concerning the&s;e Ships, was, That his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty being made to under&s;tand perfectly the affronts put on his Nation by the Turks; and not fully &s;atisfied (as is &s;uppo&s;ed) with the re&s;pect they had &s;hown to his Amba&s;&s;a|dor at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> made it the chief De&s;ign of his Ships to withdraw him from thence, &s;up|po&s;ing it a le&s;s diminution to his honour, to have the per&s;on of his Agent &s;ubjected to af|fronts, than of his Amba&s;&s;ador, to which (it was imagined) he might be obnoxious, in con|&s;ideration of tho&s;e great &s;upplies, which were in the following year de&s;igned for <HI>Candia.</HI> In what manner &s;oever the Turks deemed of this appearance of Men of War to hector and brave them at their Imperial City, they did yet for the pre&s;ent cunningly di&s;&s;emble the matter, giving the <HI>French</HI> fair Words, and what plenty of Provi&s;ions their oc|ca&s;ions did require. In what manner this Affair was tran&s;acted, I &s;hall not adventure to relate, nor is it well or certainly known; Yet not long after came Orders for the Amba&s;&s;a|dor to repair to the Court at <HI>Lari&s;&s;a;</HI> and that until the Grand Signior's plea&s;ure was far|ther known, the Ships of War were to be detained. The Commander in chief, called Mon&s;ieur <HI>d' Almeras,</HI> was not a little troubled to have his Ships thus embargued, and labour|ing in his thoughts between the time limited in his In&s;tructions by his Ma&s;ter and the re&s;traint by the Turks, he once bravely re&s;olved to hazard his pa&s;&s;age through the Ca&s;tles, but protracting the execution thereof from day to day, even until the end of <HI>April;</HI> at length Licence came for their departure, and Orders to repair unto <HI>Vola,</HI> near <HI>Lari&s;&s;a,</HI> there to take an Amba&s;&s;ador, or Agent, or Envoy&eacute; from the Sultan to their King. For it &s;eems, the Vizier had intimated to the Grand Signior, That it was not time to di&s;gu&s;t the French King, and to bring him under the notion of a declared and publick Enemy, or at lea&s;t to irri|tate him &s;o far as might provoke him to &s;end greater Forces, than perhaps he de&s;igned the next year, for <HI>Candia:</HI> and that he ought to comply with the pre&s;ent conjuncture, and &s;alve that up for a time, which he might afterwards open at his plea&s;ure.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Grand Signior &s;ends a Me&s;|&s;enger to the French King.</NOTE> This coun&s;el &s;eeming rea&s;onable to the Grand Signior, and agreeable to the pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ity, he ordered (as I was credibly informed) a thou&s;and Dollars only to adorn his Amba&s;&s;ador; &s;o pitifully do the Turks e&s;teem of Chri&s;tian Princes, and &s;o highly do they value them&s;elves, as if a Me&s;|&s;age from them would be reverenced in Chri&s;tendom as a favour, though brought by a Porter or a Slave.

<PB N="209" REF="106">con&s;idering this allowance too mean a pro|vi&s;ion for a per&s;on qualified to appear before his Ma&s;ter, did (as it is &s;aid) out of his own Pur&s;e and generous Soul contribute a far greater Sum, with two Ve&s;ts of Sables towards his better Equipage. In this manner the Sultan di&s;&s;embling an appearance of good corre&s;pondence with his Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, di&s;patched away his Envoy&eacute; on the Ships of War, being a Per&s;on in quality of a <HI>Mutafaraca,</HI> one of the &s;ame degree with a Chaous, to expo&s;tulate with the King concerning &s;everal Particulars, and e&s;pe|cially his Rea&s;ons for &s;ending for his Amba&s;&s;a|dor, without &s;ending another according to ancient cu&s;tom to &s;upply his Office, wondering much at this &s;udden alteration of friend&s;hip, without any cau&s;e given on the Ottoman &s;ide: and with the&s;e &s;mooth and fair words the Turks imagined they might charm the Spirit of the King for a while, and &s;u&s;pend his Succours from <HI>Candia,</HI> until at la&s;t it were beyond his power and wi&s;dom to relieve. In the mean time the Amba&s;&s;ador from the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King was detained as an Ho&s;tage for the other, of who&s;e return we &s;hall &s;peak in its due place.</P>
<P>Towards the end of this year Sir <HI>Daniel Harvey</HI> Lord Amba&s;&s;ador from His Maje&s;ty of Great <HI>Britain</HI> arrived at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir <HI>Daniel Harvey</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador from his Maje&s;ty.</NOTE> &s;uc|ceeding in the place of the Earl of <HI>Winchel&s;ea,</HI> who could not obtain Audience with the G.

The Enemy having by their great number of Pioniers elevated the confu&s;ed Earth, they formed &s;ome Batteries, fortifying them and &s;heltering their people with Sacks of Wool, and a Labyrinth (as we may &s;ay) of Redoubts, they advanced foot by foot upon the Revelin of St. <HI>Andrea,</HI> being de&s;titute of all Mines to &s;top their proceedings; and having at length blown up the Revelin, and with fire, and earth having taken the Out-work, they penetrated into the Ditch (which was not deep) with four Traver&s;es, and came now to the very foot of the wall of the Bul|wark, fortified with eighteen pieces of Cannon, &s;ix of which carrying fifty pound Bullet &s;hot into the Ditch, eight flanked that &s;ide which was oppo&s;ite to <HI>Panigra,</HI> and four on that part towards the Revelin of St. <HI>Spirito,</HI> notwith|&s;tanding which they &s;tormed the Walls in nine places.

For now three or four years had ran on, that the French, Dutch, Italians, and other Nations had introduced into all parts of the Turki&s;h Dominions (unle&s;s in tho&s;e Ea&s;t|ward, as <HI>Aleppo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;tory of the fal&s;e Reaux or Temins.</NOTE> and farther) a &s;ort of &s;mall Mony called by &s;ome <HI>Luigini,</HI> by others <HI>Ot|tavi,</HI> and by the Turks <HI>Temins,</HI> worth about five pence Engli&s;h; which appearing plea&s;ant and bright to the eye, and commodious for change, and common expences, &s;o bewitched the Commonalty, that Pieces of Eight, Zai|chins, and other merchantable Money were laid a&s;ide, as neither currant or valuable. At fir&s;t about nine years pa&s;t they were of good and warrantable Silver, but afterwards with time by little and little grew wor&s;e and of ba&s;er alloy: at length the people doting more and more upon them, they came coar&s;er every day than other; and being &s;till currantly pa&s;&s;able, every per&s;on that was failed, and of bad reputation entred into the Trade, who knowing no bounds of hone&s;ty or of gain, compo&s;ed their Mony wholly of Copper or coar&s;er Metals, with a fair glo&s;s and re&s;emblance of Silver, buying therewith the Commodities of the Country; and at length ama&s;&s;ed up all the Gold, Silver, and what&s;oever came to hand was the price of their fal&s;e and ba&s;tard Coin, with which they filled and abu&s;ed all <HI>A&s;ia:</HI> nor was this Money only of one Mint, but of di|vers Stamps and Mottoes reproachful to the Turks, and it is pity they had not wit e|nough to under&s;tand them, as namely, <HI>Voluit hanc A&s;ia mercem. De procul pretiam ejus,</HI> and &s;uch like; which were &s;o various, that many who had the curio&s;ity to make a col|lection of them, found no le&s;s than an hundred and twenty &s;everal Stamps. The Commonalty &s;till enamoured with the brightne&s;s of their colour, and commodiou&s;ne&s;s of their change, little reflected on the ill con&s;equence to the generality, having &s;eldom more than to &s;upply
<PB N="210" REF="107">their daily wants. And the Officers of the the Cu&s;toms finding a benefit extraordinary to them&s;elves upon the va&s;t Sums of Money im|ported, little cared how it fared with the pub|lick. In the mean time the whole currant of Merchandi&s;e in the Levant was di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of its ordinary and true chanel; for va&s;t quantities or a glut of Turki&s;h Goods filled all Chri&s;ten|dom, the prices low and cheap, and no profit to any Merchant dealing upon the &s;quare, or upon the old and legal way of Traffick. At <HI>Ligorne</HI> and other parts of <HI>Italy</HI> complaints were made, That the Silver and Bullion of the Country were melted down to make a compo&s;ition with ba&s;er Metals for <HI>Turkie,</HI> and exchanged for decaying and peri&s;hable Commo|dities. In &s;hort, no man &s;eemed &s;atisfied with the Trade, and yet the World, like their &s;ins, which they di&s;approve, pur&s;ued it with all heat and violence imaginable. This Trade being thus over-laid, and va&s;t heaps of adulterate Mony imported daily wor&s;e and wor&s;e, cau&s;ed the Jews and other Merchants at fir&s;t to except again&s;t &s;ome forts, and admit of others. This &s;cruple, together with the prohibition of them two years before by the Engli&s;h Factory at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> obliging them&s;elves unto the Levant Company under a con&s;iderable penalty not to receive this mony for Cloth or other Commo|dities of the growth of <HI>England,</HI> together with the circum&s;pection and contrivance of the Engli&s;h Con&s;ul, awakened fir&s;t the blind minds of the Turks, who having long been infatuated with this beloved mony, began now to reject and abhor it like the fal&s;e and farded countenance of a Courti&s;an: &s;o that from eleven they fell to twelve, and &s;o to thirteen and fourteen to the Lion-Dollars. In which conjuncture a Dutch Convoy arrived at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> importing va&s;t Sums thereof; which for a Bribe to the Officers of the City, or what the Cu&s;tomer would ask, were permitted Licence to be landed; which overflowing in great abundance, and ra|ther of a wor&s;e than better alloy, went decli|ning to eighteen, and &s;o to twenty, at which Rate for a &s;hort time they pa&s;&s;ed currant. And now at this price the Officers did what was po&s;&s;ible to keep them up, conceiving it im|po&s;&s;ible, in a time of &s;o much &s;carcity of all &s;orts of other Coins, that the Countries could &s;ub&s;i&s;t, or that Trade in buying or &s;elling could proceed, if this mony &s;hould wholly lo&s;e its e&s;teem and value: nor were the people &s;o much the care of the Governours, though for many years they had known no other price or reward of their labours, as were the va&s;t damages of the Sultan, in who&s;e Coffers were con&s;iderable Sums, which were never known to have been pla|ced unto the lo&s;s of the Exchequer; for it is a Proverb among&s;t the Turks, <HI>That the Grand Signiors Lead cannot &s;ink.</HI> But that which rai&s;ed mo&s;t of tumult was the rigour of the Tax-gatherers, who refu&s;ed to take that mony from the people for their Duties to the Grand Signior, but demanded of them Lion-Dollars, <HI>Sevil</HI> and <HI>Mexico</HI> Pieces of Eight, or the like; which they not being able to find, beat and im|pri&s;oned them in all places, where this que&s;tion came into di&s;pute: the people hereupon, though patient, and accu&s;tomed to violence and burden, could not yet &s;upport longer an oppre&s;&s;ion &s;o unrea&s;onable, but that In&s;urrection was made in all places where this came into di&s;pute: and as injured patience turns to fury, at <HI>Pru&s;a</HI> and <HI>Angora</HI> the torrent of the peoples rage was not appea&s;ed without the blood and lives of &s;ome of their Officers, alledging with good rea&s;on, That their Mini&s;ters and Governors having in|troduced or permitted this mony among&s;t them, and allowed it as currant in that man|ner, as that they had for &s;ome years known no other, nor received other for all the fruits of their labour or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, they ought not now to refu&s;e to receive that which they them|&s;elves had made pa&s;&s;able: which argument and rea&s;on was pre&s;&s;ed in &s;undry places with that violence, that the Officers were forced to &s;ubmit to the nece&s;&s;ity of the times, and the fury of the multitude. And now this mony had wholly lo&s;t its reputation, and began to be refu&s;ed generally at any rate what&s;oever; &s;o that though the Government thought fit to licen&s;e them at thirty to the Dollar; yet the people pro&s;ecuting the aba&s;ement of it with a hate and di&s;affection equal to their former de&s;ires, refu&s;ed generally and ab&s;olutely to accept them in payment. Wherefore the Sultan perceiving that the power of his Officers was not &s;ufficient to render this mony longer pa&s;&s;able at any rate, at length he commanded, that every one &s;hould bring in his mony of the&s;e &s;orts into the Mint where it &s;hould be melted down, and the Silver it produced &s;hould be delivered to the Proprietor. At which Summons &s;everal Great men voluntari|ly brought in their mony, others had it &s;eized and condemned to the Furnace, among&s;t which was a French Merchant ingaged to the import of &s;ixty thou&s;and Dollars. As yet the News of this alteration not having reached Chri&s;ten|dom, divers-Ships arrived at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> with va&s;t Sums of this mony, which were all &s;eized and forced to the Mint. In like manner other Ships arrived at <HI>Smyrna</HI> with the &s;ame Commodity, which my &s;elf would not &s;uffer to be landed, and &s;ome of them having no other foundation of Stock or Freight, returned empty, to the great lo&s;s of the Employers. It was &s;trange to &s;ee, how on a &s;udden all Trade cea&s;ed, no mony being left in the Country, few Bargains were made but by Bar|ters; and though all this ruine might wholly be attributed to the ill Government, yet the people were contented, and &s;ate down with the lo&s;s. And thus concluded this extravagant Trade of fal&s;e Mony, being &s;uppo&s;ed to have wrought more of de&s;truction and lo&s;s at the end, than it brought of benefit at the begin|ning; memorable for nothing more than for expiring &s;o quietly, though it had the chief part of the Turki&s;h Empire to &s;upport and defend it.</P>
<P>During the&s;e Troubles the Grand Signior pa&s;&s;ed his time in hunting near <HI>Lari&s;&s;a,</HI> where he ruined the Country round about, and tired the people with beating and driving the Woods for Game and wild Bea&s;ts to diverti&s;e him, in which, as formerly, he continued &s;o exce&s;&s;ively immoderate, that without con&s;ide|ration of the heats, or colds, or moi&s;ture of the &s;ea&s;on, he compelled the people, but e&s;pe|cially the Jews (of which great numbers in|habit that Country) to continual labours in the Woods and Fields; by which many died through the rigid Fro&s;ts of the Winter and Calentures of the Summer. But yet notwith|&s;tanding the&s;e Diverti&s;ements, the Grand Signior could not ea&s;ily ca&s;t off the melan|choly
<PB N="211" REF="107">apprehen&s;ions and fears he had for the &s;tate of his Affairs, imagining that the long delays and ill &s;ucce&s;s at <HI>Candia,</HI> and defaults in Govern|ment had begotten in his Subjects a hate to|wards his Per&s;on, and a de&s;ire of alteration. Wherefore the Spring approaching, he retired into a &s;olitary but plea&s;ant &s;hade among&s;t the Mountains, where &s;prang cool and cry&s;talline waters, about &s;ixteen hours Journey from <HI>La|ri&s;&s;a.</HI> In this &s;olitude his melancholy thoughts again di&s;quieted him with a jealou&s;ie and &s;u&s;pici|on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Grand Signior de|&s;igns to cut off his Bro|thers.</NOTE> le&s;t his Brothers now at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> &s;hould take their advantage, and one of them be by the Peoples con&s;ent and a&s;&s;i&s;tance placed in his Imperial Seat: which imagination made that impre&s;&s;ion in him, that he immediately di&s;patched away a tru&s;ty and valiant Officer with all &s;ecrecy, without making any noi&s;e, to bring him their Heads, directing his Commands to his Mother, in who&s;e cu&s;tody they were; not doubting of her help and a&s;&s;ent, as being mo&s;t nearly concerned in his intere&s;t, expected every hour the return of his Me&s;&s;enger with that grateful Pre&s;ent, which could only cure the torture of his jealou&s;ie, and alleviate his cares. But no &s;ooner was this fatal Command arrived at the hands of the Queen, but &s;he trembled &s;o much, that &s;he could &s;carce hold the Paper. At length con&s;idering, that (as hath been &s;aid before) &s;he had given in caution to the Jani&s;aries for the lives of the&s;e Princes, and that to her care they were committed &s;he immediately di&s;|clo&s;ed and publi&s;hed the de&s;ign of the Grand Signior to the Jani&s;ar-Aga, craving his help and protection, prote&s;ting that &s;he was re&s;olved to maintain the faith &s;he had given to tho&s;e Princes, who&s;e life &s;he tendered equal with her own. This advice and re&s;olution of the Queen-Mother being brought to the Jani&s;aries, was heartily approved, and prote&s;tations, given that they would never abandon her, nor the lives &s;he pre&s;erved. The rumour hereof in an in&s;tant flew through the &s;treets; but with &s;uch variety of reports, that nothing of cer|tainty was known, only in general &s;ome great ruine was apprehended to threaten the City; whereupon a &s;trange outcry was made to &s;hut up the &s;hops, and every one to con&s;ult the &s;afety of the Publick. But &s;ome few hours after, it being more di&s;tinctly known, that the Grand Signior had &s;ent for the Heads of his Brothers; the People of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> who&s;e &s;ole hopes of &s;eeing the Royal City re&s;tored to its ancient Honour, was by the con&s;ervation of the&s;e Princes, were in a greater combu&s;ti|on than before; for every one then betook him&s;elf to his Arms: &s;o that in a &s;hort time were a&s;&s;embled forty thou&s;and men at <HI>Okmedon</HI> well appointed, where confiding in the &s;trength of a general Cau&s;e, in which they were ingaged, they vented many opprobrious &s;peeches again&s;t the Government, calling the Chief Mini&s;ters <HI>Or&s;y&s;ler,</HI> which is unfortunate Fellows, a term among&s;t the Turks, of the greate&s;t ignominy, e&s;pecially to a Governor, and loudly exclaimed and wi&s;hed for a reformation. In the mean time the Queen-Mother de&s;ired aid from the Jani&s;aries, and Guards about the Apartments of the Princes, le&s;t the Bo&s;tangees, who are the Creatures of the Grand Signior, &s;hould a&s;&s;ault their Quarters. The Con&s;ultations al&s;o among&s;t the Jani&s;aries were long and &s;ecret, and the Queen-Mother di&s;patched &s;everal Me&s;&s;ages to the Grand Signior, advi&s;ing him to for&s;ake the Mountains, and repair to one of his Imperial Cities, as became the Maje&s;ty of &s;o great a Sultan, being the only means to &s;ecure to him the e&s;tabli&s;hment of his Crown. And now the Reader will with impatience at|tend the conclu&s;ion and i&s;&s;ue of &s;o great ru|mours and di&s;turbances; but it is now, as it hath been experienced in other Common|wealths,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tac. Lib. 6.</NOTE> <HI>acribus, ut ferm&egrave; talia, initiis, incurio&s;o fine,</HI> matters violent in their original, &s;pend them&s;elves at fir&s;t, and produce nothing re|markable in their end. And &s;o was the effect of the&s;e rece&s;&s;es, and mutiny of the people at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> who&s;e humour of novelty and change venting it &s;elf, and in four or five days tired with expectation; at length every one be|gan to return to his dwelling and employment. The face likewi&s;e of things at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> &s;eemed quiet and appea&s;ed, carrying with it, as it were, a &s;till mode&s;ty and &s;hame for the late di&s;orders; and nothing was heard or mur|mured for the &s;pace of twenty or thirty days after, until the Grand Signior trembling with the fears of this confu&s;ed Rebellion, kept more &s;trict Guards than ordinary within his moun|tains, and after being better recollected, entered into Con&s;ultation, and being advi&s;ed of the Heads and Leaders of the late In&s;urrection, pro&s;cribed &s;uch as were the prime Actors, and having di&s;patched away two or three Me&s;&s;en|gers on this Errant, they entered &s;ecretly in the Night to their Lodgings, where they quiet|ly, and without noi&s;e, took off the heads of four or five of them, and bani&s;hed as many without the lea&s;t noi&s;e, or notice taken thereof by the Vulgar. And becau&s;e this di&s;order happened at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> for which the chief Commander ought to an&s;wer, the Chimacam pa&s;&s;ed not without a jealou&s;ie either of negli|gence or con&s;ent; wherefore the Vizier &s;ent for him and the Jani&s;ar-Aga to <HI>Candia,</HI> as if he had occa&s;ion of their &s;ervice, though not without their own fears and &s;u&s;picion of others, to an&s;wer and make &s;atisfaction for the late mutiny. And thus for a while this Flame is extingui&s;hed, and the fire raked up in the Embers. We mu&s;t expect a while and ob&s;erve when and where it will again bur&s;t forth.</P>
<P>The Spring now approaching, which &s;up|plies new Spirits, and warm and fre&s;h bloud into the Veins of Man, as well as &s;ap in Trees, and life in other Vegetables; let us return again to the Wars, and &s;urvey the Camp, and po|&s;ture of Affairs before the walls in <HI>Candia.</HI> The Turki&s;h Army, which, like worms be|nummed with the Cold of Winter, had lain immured between their Banks of Earth, did not ply their A&s;&s;aults &s;o frequently as they had done in Summer, only for a Winters exerci&s;e, battered the inward Works of St. <HI>Andrea</HI>'s Fort, which as we &s;aid before, they had hardly be&s;et. And now the time for action being again come about,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Turks &s;torm again the Fort of St. <HI>An|drea.</HI></NOTE> they renewed their &s;torm on that &s;ide &s;o violently, pre&s;&s;ing forward the lea&s;t e&s;teem|ed of their Souldiery, that with the help of Spade and Mattock, and blowing up of &s;ome Mines, they penetrated forty paces within the Walls of the City: But the Chri&s;tians having long &s;ince for&s;een <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">e weakne&s;s of that &s;ide, made it part of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">inters labours to draw another Wall from the Fort <HI>Panigra</HI> (who&s;e Revelin or Out-work was before blown up) cro&s;&s;ing over almo&s;t to the <HI>Tram<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ta,</HI> which they for|tified as well as could be expected, and
<PB N="212" REF="108">made con&s;tant and bold re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the Enemy. Notwith&s;tanding which the Turks pre&s;&s;ed &s;o con&s;tantly and boldly forward, that though the Chri&s;tians were &s;trong within, and provided with all &s;orts of provi&s;ions both of war and &s;u&s;tenance, yet nothing &s;upported their Courages and Spirits more than the expectati|on of promi&s;ed Succours from <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy;</HI> it being reported, and generally believed, that they would be &s;o numerous as might be able to give Battel in the Field unto the Turk, and force them out of their Trenches; for by no other means was it po&s;&s;ible for this City to be relieved: for it might fare with this place, as it did formerly with <HI>Rhodes</HI> and <HI>O&s;tend,</HI> which, though wanting neither men nor provi&s;ions, were yet taken by palms and inches of ground, till not &s;o much was left, as would hold men to defend them. A pregnant example (as Sr. <HI>Wil|liam Temple</HI> well ob&s;erves) how impo&s;&s;ible it is to defend any Town that cannot be relieved by an Army &s;trong enough to rai&s;e the Siege. Whil&s;t the Chri&s;tians were entertained with the&s;e hopes, the Turks fortified them&s;elves without as &s;trongly as the be&s;ieged had within, heaving like Moles with their numerous Army of Pio|neers, who&s;e lives being not valued, they were wholly intent unto Mines, blowing up all be|fore them, in that manner that every day they gained a pace of ground within the City. So that in effect (as will be &s;een by the Sequel) this mo&s;t impregnable Fort of the World was forced and taken by the Spade and Shovel, and by a Crew of unarmed Labourers, who under&s;tood nothing more than the Plough and Harrow. So that now this Town &s;eemed to be reduced to its utmo&s;t Cri&s;is, either of being taken, or for ever freed of this malignant Enemy. And indeed the Turks had &s;o far advanced upon the Bulwark of St. <HI>Andrea,</HI> that now nothing remained of it, more than ruines, and undige&s;ted heaps of Earth and &s;tone, in defence of which the chief Commanders applying them&s;elves in per&s;on with all diligence, the Marque&s;s St. <HI>An|drea Montbrun</HI> was wounded by a &s;tone in the face, the Cavalier <HI>de Bret</HI> was buried in the ruines to the very Neck, and with difficulty drawn out of the Earth by A&s;&s;i&s;tants about him; two other Cavaliers were wounded with Granadoes, and the Cavalier <HI>Fuillere,</HI> who car|ried the Standard of <HI>Malta,</HI> was &s;hot into the Eye with a Musket. The Proveditor General <HI>Carnaro</HI> &s;erving at the repair of the Breach, was &s;o wounded in the Belly by a Granado, that his Bowels bur&s;t, of which he died in three hours; and with a piece of the &s;ame Gra|nado the Count <HI>Vignole,</HI> a French Gentle|man of great Valour, was likewi&s;e &s;lain: And &s;o hotly the Turks plyed this Breach, that from the <HI>28th.</HI> of <HI>May</HI> to the <HI>2d</HI> of <HI>June</HI> they &s;prang five Mines, which brake all the Pali&s;ades of the Chri&s;tians; the which the Turks &s;econded with that fury and mettle, as if they intended to win the place and make an end of their work, before the arrival of the Forces expected from Chri&s;tendom. And this Po&s;t was now grown &s;o dangerous and weak, that the Captain-General, the Marque&s;s of <HI>Mont|brun,</HI> and all the chief Officers took up their Quarters at this place, where his Excellency kept an open Table, and the Marque&s;s took up his Lodgings at Night, that &s;o the other Officers might have no excu&s;e on account of attendances or orders to abandon the&s;e Quar|ters.</P>
<P>The Princes of Chri&s;tendom all this time for|got not their be&s;ieged Brethren in <HI>Candia.</HI> Pope <HI>Clement</HI> the IX. pre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King to make ready his &s;uccours in due time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Succours &s;ent out of Chri&s;ten|dom.</NOTE> who had already him&s;elf prepared all things, and elected the Duke of <HI>Beaufort</HI> his General of all the Forces by Sea, whether of French or other Nations. This Duke, like a couragious and brave Prince, thinking it little glory to command at Sea, where the Enemy was of an inferiour and unable Force to encounter him, did therefore de&s;ire Licence from his King to make tryal of his Fortune in the Field, where he might evidence his Valour in the face of the Infidels, and &s;ignalize his Fame either by Death or Victory. The King, unwilling to hazard &s;o worthy a per&s;on of his bloud out of his due Command in the rank of an ordinary Souldier, at fir&s;t denied his reque&s;ts; but the Pope interceding for him, who&s;e General he was, with holy Arguments, and devout Contem|plations of Martyrdom, and glory of dying for the Chri&s;tian Cau&s;e, at length obtained a conce&s;&s;ion from the King, who of him&s;elf was flexible to &s;o pious a reque&s;t, e&s;teeming it unholy to deprive his Kin&s;man either of the Palm of a Martyr, or the Lawrel of a Conqueror.</P>
<P>The Summer being come, and all things pro|vided,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The French Fleet loo&s;e from <HI>To|lon.</HI></NOTE> the Duke a&s;cended his Ship at <HI>Tolon</HI> a City in <HI>Provence,</HI> the <HI>6th.</HI> of <HI>June, New-&s;tyle,</HI> with about &s;even thou&s;and Land Souldiers, com|manded by the Duke of <HI>Navailles,</HI> with the Mar&s;hals <HI>Lebret</HI> and <HI>Colbert,</HI> and &s;everal other Worthies and Heroes of undaunted Courage, and arrived before the Town of <HI>Candia</HI> the <HI>19th.</HI> of the &s;ame Month, having ca&s;ually encountred together in the Seas on the <HI>17th.</HI> with fourteen Sail of Venetian Ships, laden with Hor&s;e and Ammunition to mount the Troops, and relieve the Town: which happy encounter and &s;peedy pa&s;&s;age, &s;eemed a happy Omen of the future &s;ucce&s;s. The appearance of this &s;uccour &s;eem|ed to the Be&s;ieged as &s;ent from Heaven, and admini&s;tred unto them new hopes and cou|rage; and the &s;alutes pa&s;&s;ed between the Town and the Fleet with the u&s;ual Ceremonies, and all the imaginable te&s;timonies of joy and triumph.</P>

The Captain-General in the mean time taking his cour&s;e along the Marine, on which part al&s;o the Turks were far advanced, cau&s;ed a Mine to be &s;prang under the thicke&s;t crowd of the Turks: which con&s;i&s;ting of an hundred Barrels of Powder, made &s;uch a de&s;truction, as abated much of the &s;torm, and induced the Enemy to retire within their Re|doubts.

</LIST>
<P>All which having taken their places, the Captain General began to declare, That the extremity of the place was &s;o well known and evident to them all, that there was no need for him to inform them of the particulars; only that he had called them together to know their opinions and coun&s;els in what manner the de|fence of the Town might be be&s;t prolonged, and what advice they would give him touching the pre&s;ent premures and emergency of Affairs. He added further, That he had by good ex|perience proved them to be as well judicious and wi&s;e in their Coun&s;els, as they were valiant in the Execution; and that now was the time to lay a&s;ide all o&s;tentation of &s;peech, and to attend unto that which was &s;olid rea&s;on and advice, which he de&s;ired every one to deliver freely with a clear and real &s;en&s;e and affection towards the grand Concernment. Then he ordered the Cancellier to read a &s;hort preamble of the matter on which they were to deliver their opinions, de&s;iring every one to expre&s;s his judgment in Writing; But after &s;ome few had &s;ub&s;cribed their Declaration, &s;o much time was &s;pent therein, that it was conceived more expedite for every per&s;on to declare his opinion by word of mouth.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t point all generally concurred, that con&s;idering the &s;mall number of the De|fendants, the Town could not hold out much longer; for that the Enemy on the &s;ide of St. <HI>Andrea</HI> was arrived to the la&s;t Retrenchment, which being low, weak, and compo&s;ed of bad matter, could not long re&s;i&s;t their power; that on the &s;ide al&s;o of <HI>Sabionera</HI> they were &s;o far advanced by the lower grounds towards the Ar&s;enal, that in a &s;hort time they would block up the Port, and cut off all provi&s;ions and &s;uccours from the Town; and that if the Enemy were re&s;olved to adventure the lo&s;s of two or three thou&s;and men by a general &s;torm; there would remain no po&s;&s;ibility of with|&s;tanding their Force. This being generally a&s;&s;ented unto, and concluded on all hands, another Que&s;tion was propounded; namely, That con&s;idering the premi&s;es, what was to be done which might render the mo&s;t effectual &s;ervice to the Republick; it was well known how important that place was to the Publick, and what va&s;t Trea&s;ures of Gold and Silver, and what plentiful Effu&s;ions of bloud had been expended and poured forth in defence thereof; and that therefore it ought to be maintained to the utmo&s;t and la&s;t ga&s;p of &s;trength; but
<PB N="217" REF="110">that it ought al&s;o to be con&s;idered, That the Town being either taken by a&s;&s;ault, or the Port blocked up, there would certainly en&s;ue &s;uch deplorable Con&s;equences as every per&s;on may imagine; and the Republick be damaged by lo&s;ing all that which is now in a po&s;&s;ibility of being &s;aved. It was therefore put to the Vote, beginning on the &s;ide of the Inferiors, as the cu&s;tom is, and &s;o a&s;cending to the chief; and it was re&s;olved that they &s;hould capitulate, and enter into a Treaty with the Turks. When it came to <HI>Grimaldi</HI>'s turn to &s;peak, he con|fe&s;&s;ed clearly, That the Town could not hold out for many days, and though it was more glorious to the Defenders to dye on the Walls of it, yet it would be of wor&s;e &s;ervice to the Publick; how&s;oever he was of opinion, that rather than &s;urrender, it would be better to burn it, or blow it up with Mines; in execu|tion of which, the wounded and un&s;erviceable people &s;hould in the fir&s;t place be &s;hipped away, then taking the opportunity of a dark and quiet Night, the Infantry might be all em|barked; it was true, as he confe&s;&s;ed, that the action was difficult and full of hazard; how&s;o|ever, two things moved him to this Coun&s;el; One was, The little a&s;&s;urance he conceived of the faith of the Turks; and the other was, The gloriou&s;ne&s;s of the action: for as this City had been in an extraordinary manner de|fended, and of which the World cannot give the like example; &s;o the end thereof would not be le&s;s renowned and famous, it not being a greater triumph to drive the Enemy from the Walls, than being vanqui&s;ht to leave a bloudy Victory, and in&s;tead of a Palace a heap of &s;tones and a&s;hes. Many of the Council, and among&s;t them Marque&s;s St. <HI>Andrea Mont|brun</HI> was of the &s;ame opinion, and the Com|mi&s;&s;ary <HI>Minio</HI> endeavoured to &s;econd it with efficacious Arguments; But in fine, after a long Di&s;cour&s;e, they all concluded that the re&s;olu|tion was more generous than practicable; by rea&s;on that &s;o many people could not be em|barked without knowledge of the Enemy, who was not only quartered near, but within the very Walls of the City.</P>
<P>The Captain General was of a different opinion; for that be&s;ides the difficulty of em|barking the Souldiery, there were al&s;o &s;ome other con&s;iderations which might di&s;&s;wade this re&s;olution, and render it more prejudicial to the Publick than a Surrender by Compo&s;ition. After &s;ome &s;hort debate, all at length concur|red in the &s;ame &s;entiment, from which al&s;o <HI>Grimaldi</HI> did not much di&s;&s;ent, confe&s;&s;ing that the propo&s;ition he had made would prove difficult in the Execution; how&s;oever, con&s;i|dering the little faith which the Turks ob&s;erve, he thought it more &s;ecure to confide their &s;afety to Fortune and their own Swords, than to the engagements and moderation of a perfi|dious and enraged Enemy. In &s;hort, he &s;ub|mitted wholly to the better judgments of the Council, and more particularly to the Cap|tain-General, and the Marque&s;s of St. <HI>Andrea,</HI> who were be&s;t acquainted with what more nearly concerned the &s;ervice and intere&s;t of the Prince.</P>
<P>In fine, the conclu&s;ion was, That they &s;hould enter into a Treaty with the Vizier, and endeavour to obtain the mo&s;t advan|tageous Conditions po&s;&s;ible. How&s;oever, it was thought fit to adverti&s;e fir&s;t this their de|termination to the Auxiliary Forces at <HI>Standia;</HI> and to renew the in&s;tances they had formerly made to them for three thou&s;and men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Re&s;ult of the Coun|cil.</NOTE> with which, and with two thou&s;and Gally Slaves they would endeavour the making of another Retrenchment, whereby the Town might be con&s;erved for &s;ome time longer. How&s;oever, in this Interim the Captain General being willing to touch the Viziers pul&s;e, that he might better di&s;cover in what manner he &s;tood affected towards a Treaty, di&s;patched one Colonel <HI>Thomas Anand,</HI> an Engli&s;hman, of courage, and of able Parts, and of intire hone&s;ty, together with one <HI>Stefano Cordili,</HI> an intelligent young man to the Vizier's Camp; and that his de&s;ign might not be di&s;covered by tho&s;e of the Town, they were ordered to pa&s;s from <HI>Standia</HI> with a white Flag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> up the River <HI>Gioffiro;</HI> and that being come to a Treaty, they &s;hould only di&s;cover the mind and inclinations of the Turks, without making known their intentions, or entering into par|ticulars.</P>
<P>Being come in this manner prepared to the Vizier's Camp, they told the Turks, That they were come to renew the Treaty begun by Signior <HI>Molino,</HI> which had been broken off by the Arrival of the French and Pope's Forces; to which a Turk, then come from the Vizier's Tent, re&s;olutely an&s;wered, That they &s;hould think of no Articles, nor Treaty without a Surrender, To which <HI>Anand</HI> replyed, That they would do well to acquaint the Vizier &s;o much, for that perhaps he might be of ano|ther opinion; and &s;o not urging farther they departed; but returning after Dinner the &s;ame Turk came down again, called <HI>Achmet</HI> Aga, a Confident of the Vizier's together with <HI>Pa|naiotti</HI> the Vizier's Interpreter; and then with more earne&s;tne&s;s declaring, That nothing would be heard, unle&s;s in the fir&s;t place they were re&s;olved to deliver the Town, and threatned them in ca&s;e they returned without this Pro|po&s;ition: The Captain General being advi&s;ed hereof, the next morning <HI>Anand</HI> and <HI>Scordili</HI> went again on the &s;ame me&s;&s;age; and meeting the Turks under <HI>Paleoca&s;tro,</HI> they acquainted them that they had orders to treat about a Surrender; but fir&s;t de&s;ired to know what Ar|ticles they would give them, and what Town in exchange for this. In this manner a Treaty being begun, it was re&s;olved for better expedi|tion to erect Tents nearer to the Town for the place of Conference, where the Plenipotentia|ries on both &s;ides were to meet. <HI>Ibrahim</HI> Pa&s;ha, late Pa&s;ha of <HI>Aleppo, Achmet</HI> Aga, the Kahya|begh of the Jani&s;aries, the Spahyler <HI>Aga&s;i,</HI> and the Interpreter <HI>Panaiotri,</HI> were the per&s;ons cho&s;en by the Turks on the part of the Chri|&s;tians, after &s;ome Debate, no other per&s;ons were cho&s;en be&s;ides <HI>Anand</HI> and <HI>Scordili,</HI> who meeting the Turks at the time and place ap|pointed, demanded of them &s;ome other place in exchange for that of <HI>Candia.</HI> To which the Turks with &s;ome heat replyed, That it was again&s;t their Law to deliver Towns where Mo&s;chs were built, into the hands of Chri&s;tians. To which the others an&s;wered, That this could not be their Law, &s;ince that in a Treaty &s;ome months pa&s;t begun by the Cavelier <HI>Molino,</HI> they had offered to deliver up into the hands of the Chri&s;tians <HI>Candia Nuova, Sitia,</HI> and <HI>Girapitra,</HI> all places where Mahometan
<PB N="218" REF="111">Mo&s;chs were erected; and though the Turks might now imagine it ea&s;ie to win the Town by force, they a&s;&s;ured them that greater diffi|culties remained; and that if they remembred what bloud, what labours, and what Trea&s;ures their &s;mall acque&s;ts and advance had co&s;t them, they might thence calculate what Force &s;till remained to conquer, and that the la&s;t ga&s;p of this dying Fortre&s;s would &s;pend it &s;elf with more ruine and de&s;truction than they had felt in all the other approaches and a&s;&s;aults there|unto. In fine, the Turks &s;eeming re&s;olved to be &s;ole Ma&s;ters of the whole Kingdom of <HI>Candia,</HI> the Venetians began to conde&s;cend to receive &s;ome compen&s;ation in another man|ner.</P>
<P>How&s;oever, the difficulties were not yet ended but greater appeared, for the Turks de|manded &s;atisfaction for the charge of the War; and the Haratch or head-mony, which for all tho&s;e years of the Wars they had not received from the people of the I&s;les of the <HI>Ar|chipelago;</HI> they demanded al&s;o a Tribute for the Forts and I&s;lands of <HI>Cerigo, Tino,</HI> and <HI>Cli&s;&s;a,</HI> and the other Conque&s;ts in <HI>Dalmatia;</HI> all which points cau&s;ed new Di&s;putes, which were maintained with tho&s;e heats, and with that ob&s;tinacy, as if it had been impo&s;&s;ible for both parties ever to meet in a conclu&s;ion. Notwith&s;tanding, after long Debates, on the fourth of <HI>September</HI> they came to agree of giving ho&s;tages, and to certain propo&s;als con|cerning the manner of &s;urrendring the place. The Turks demanded to have the Outworks put into their hands, with one of the Gates of the City, and the Pali&s;ade of the new Re|trenchment: To which <HI>Anand</HI> and <HI>Scordili</HI> an&s;wered, That this was not a propo&s;ition to be made to the Captain General, for that they were a&s;&s;ured, the Garri&s;on would &s;ooner &s;uffer them&s;elves to be cut in pieces, than to commit them&s;elves to the mercy of the Turki&s;h Soul|diery; who&s;e faith is recorded in the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Famagu&s;ta,</HI> and may &s;erve for a true ex|ample and mirror of their treachery and faithle&s;ne&s;s to all Ages. In this manner the Treaty had like to have been broken off; but at length they concluded, That it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to render an accout to the Vizier of the particulars of this Conference, ad|journing the Treaty until the next Morn|ing.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all which, the Turks did not abate in the lea&s;t point their progre&s;s in the War, labouring in their Works, and fighting with more heat than ever. The Venetians on the other &s;ide were not le&s;s active, firing con|tinually their Cannon and Granadoes, and making &s;ome little Sallies, endeavoured as much as they were able to cover the weakne&s;s of their Forces. The Turks had rai&s;ed a new Battery which broke a great part of the Pali|&s;ade of the new Retrenchment, upon which it was expected that they &s;hould make a &s;trong attempt, for who&s;e better entertainment two Mines were prepared to receive them; but they deferring the a&s;&s;ault, the Captain General gave orders to fire both the Mines at once, which con&s;i&s;ting of a hundred and fifty Barrels of Powder, made the ground to tremble both in the City and in the Camp, overthrowing &s;everal works with mi&s;erable &s;laughter of the Enemy.</P>
<P>The Turks ob&s;erving this re&s;olution in the defendants, became more tractable, and le&s;s &s;evere in their demands; &s;o that <HI>Ibrahim</HI> Pa&s;ha with the re&s;t contented them&s;elves with no other &s;ecurity for performances of Conditions than Ho&s;tages; of which three were con&s;igned mu|tually on both &s;ides. After which, other Ar|ticles were, with le&s;s Difficulty, concluded; &s;o that in the morning of the <HI>6th</HI> of <HI>September</HI> the Turks demanded that the Chri&s;tians &s;hould give all their Articles in Writing; whereupon the Council ordered <HI>Grimaldi</HI> to draw them up; which were in &s;ub&s;tance as followeth.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Con|ditions of Peace.</NOTE> That for obtaining a good and la&s;ting Peace, it is agree'd, That the City of <HI>Candia,</HI> with all its Cannon which were planted there before the time of the War, be con&s;igned into the hands of the Vizier.</P>
<P>Secondly, That quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion be given to the Republick of <HI>Suda, Carabu&s;a,</HI> and <HI>Spina Longa,</HI> with the Territories thereunto belonging, with the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Cli&s;&s;a</HI> in <HI>Dal|matia.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, That the Venetians may carry away all the Cannon which have been brought into the Town &s;ince the beginning of the War.</P>
<P>Fourthly, That for embarking the Soul|diery, Pionieers, and Inhabitants of all Quali|ties and Conditions, with their Arms, Provi&s;i|ons, and Baggage twelve days time &s;hall be granted and a&s;&s;igned.</P>
<P>Fifthly, That what &s;hall remain un&s;hipped at the end of the twelve days afore&s;aid, the Vizier &s;hall, with his own Boats, a&s;&s;i&s;t to the lading thereof.</P>
<P>Sixthly, That during this time of truce, no per&s;on what&s;oever &s;hall tran&s;gre&s;s his Limits, or pa&s;s the bounds of his Station or Quarters; and that he who doth &s;hall be treated as an Enemy.</P>
<P>Seventhly, That &s;o &s;oon as the&s;e Articles &s;hall be &s;ub&s;cribed under the white Flag, all Acts of Ho&s;tility &s;hall cea&s;e both on one &s;ide and the other.</P>
<P>Eighthly, That for &s;ecurity of performance of the&s;e Articles, three Ho&s;tages be mutually given on one &s;ide and the other.</P>
<P>Ninthly, That for better a&s;&s;urance, that the Venetians will u&s;e all their endeavours to embark their Men and Goods, the Turks may employ two Officers for Eye-witne&s;&s;es of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Tenthly, That for better effecting hereof, all Ships, Gallies, and other Ve&s;&s;els may freely approach near unto the &s;hore, and enter into the Port both by Day and Night.</P>
<P>Eleventhly, That the Venetian Fleet may remain at <HI>Standia,</HI> or at any other I&s;land in the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> until &s;uch time as they are di&s;patched, or that things are duly prepared for their departure.</P>
<P>Twelfthly, That all Commi&s;&s;ions given by one &s;ide and the other be revoked, and that who&s;oever &s;hall after the &s;pace of forty days commit any Act of Ho&s;tility again&s;t the tenor of the&s;e Articles of Peace, &s;hall be puni&s;hed with capital puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>Thirteenly, That &s;o &s;oon as an Amba&s;&s;a|dor from <HI>Venice</HI> &s;hall arrive at the Port, all Slaves or Pri&s;oners of War taken under the Venetian Colours &s;hall be freed and re|lea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Fourteenthly, That what depredations &s;hall be made at Sea or Land after the&s;e Articles
<PB N="219" REF="111">are &s;ub&s;cribed, and before the publication thereof, &s;hall be faithfully made good and re|&s;tored.</P>
<P>Fifteenthly, That a general pardon be given to the Subjects of both &s;ides, who have acted contrary to their Faith and Allegiance, during this War.</P>
<P>Sixteenthly, That in Vertue of the&s;e Capi|tulations the former Articles be likewi&s;e con|firmed which were made in the Year 1571, and that no Tribute or Pre&s;ent be demanded from the Port, unle&s;s as hath formerly been paid for &s;uch I&s;lands as the Venetians hold in the <HI>Archipelago.</HI></P>
<P>Seventeenthly, That of the&s;e Articles two Copies be made, one in Turki&s;h with its Tran&s;lation into Italian, &s;ub&s;cribed by the Vizier, and &s;ealed with the Grand Signior's Signet; and the other in Italian underwrote by the Captain-General, and &s;ealed with the Seal of the Republick.</P>
<P>The&s;e Articles being &s;igned, the Ho&s;tages were given both on one &s;ide and the other. Tho&s;e given by the Venetians were <HI>Fau&s;tino da Riva</HI> Lieutenant-General, <HI>Giovanni Batti&s;ta Calbo</HI> Commi&s;&s;ary, and <HI>Zaccaria Mocenigo</HI> who had been Duke of <HI>Candia.</HI> Tho&s;e given by the Turks were <HI>Belin A&s;&s;an</HI> Pa&s;ha, <HI>Mahomet</HI> Aga of the Jani&s;aries, and <HI>Gurgi Bei</HI> Tefterdar or Trea&s;urer.</P>
<P>During this Siege, of the Venetians &s;ide there were killed and wounded thirty thou&s;and nine hundred eighty five, of the Turks one hundred eighteen thou&s;and &s;even hundred fifty four.</P>
<P>The Batteries which the Turks rai&s;ed a|gain&s;t <HI>Sabionera</HI> and St. <HI>Andrea,</HI> con&s;i&s;ted of fifty nine Pieces of Cannon, carrying from fifty to an hundred and twenty pound weight of Bullet.</P>
<P>The Storms which the Turks made upon the Town were fifty &s;ix.</P>
<P>The Combats under ground forty five.</P>
<P>The Sallies made by the Venetians ninety &s;ix.</P>
<P>The Mines and Fornelli &s;prang by the Vene|tians eleven hundred &s;eventy three, by the Turks four hundred &s;eventy two.</P>
<P>The Venetians &s;pent Barrels of Powder fifty thou&s;and three hundred and &s;eventeen.</P>
<P>Bomboes of all &s;orts by the Venetians of fifty to five hundred weight, were forty eight thou&s;and an hundred and nineteen.</P>
<P>Granadoes of Bra&s;s and Iron an hundred thou&s;and nine hundred and &s;ixty: Granadoes of Gla&s;s eighty four thou&s;and eight hundred &s;eventy four.</P>
<P>Cannon &s;hot of all &s;orts two hundred &s;eventy &s;ix thou&s;and &s;even hundred forty three.</P>
<P>Pounds of Lead eighteen millions forty four thou&s;and nine hundred fifty &s;even. Of Match pounds thirteen millions twelve thou&s;and five hundred.</P>
<P>What quantities the Turks might con&s;ume of Ammunition is not certain; only it is ob|&s;ervable, That the Bra&s;s taken up in the &s;treets which came from the Enemies Bomboes was &s;o much, that whole Ware-hou&s;es were filled with the Metal, and &s;o much &s;old as yielded many thou&s;ands of Crowns.</P>
<P>The Articles being &s;ub&s;cribed, and Ho&s;tages given, the Captain-General attended with all application of mind and indu&s;try imaginable to imbark the Men and Ammunition, com|mitting in the mean time the care of the City to <HI>Cornaro</HI> the Proveditor of the Fleet.</P>
<P>During the&s;e days that all things were pro|viding in order to a Surrender, there was great &s;ilence in the Turki&s;h Camp, and no di&s;order in the City; the Souldiers on the Ramparts, and the Turks in their Trenches &s;aluted each other with civility, and entertained communi|cation and di&s;cour&s;es together with friend&s;hip and freedom of &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages relating to their War, nothing of quarrel, or &s;cuffle, or rude words happening out between them in all the term of the twelve days. The Vizier &s;ent divers times civil Me&s;&s;ages and Pre&s;ents of re|fre&s;hment to the Captain-General and Marque&s;s St. <HI>Andrea,</HI> which they returned with equal re&s;pect and genero&s;ity; and &s;o exce&s;&s;ive were the Turks in the&s;e offices, that the Venetians began to be jealous, le&s;t under this mark and gui&s;e of courte&s;ie &s;ome fraud or de&s;ign &s;hould be covered according to their own Proverb: <HI>Chi ti fa piu carezze che &s;uole, &oacute; ti ha engannato &oacute; enganar ti vuole.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;hort, all things were di&s;patched with that diligence and care, that on the <HI>27th</HI> of <HI>September</HI> the City was con&s;igned; all the In|habitants departed thence, not one remaining in the City, except only two Greek Prie&s;ts, a Woman, and three Jews.</P>
<P>In this manner the Whole I&s;le of <HI>Candia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The War began in <HI>April 1645.</HI></NOTE> the cau&s;e and occa&s;ion of all that Blood and Trea&s;ure that was &s;pilt, and exhau&s;ted in twen|ty five years War, fell at length to the for|tune and increa&s;e of the Turki&s;h Empire, with its mo&s;t impregnable Fortre&s;s of the World, &s;trengthened with as much Art and Indu&s;try, as the human Wit of this Age was capable to invent, after a &s;trait Siege of two years, three months, and twenty &s;even days. For the &s;pace of twelve days allotted for the Surrender being expired,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Candia <HI>delivered.</HI></NOTE> on the <HI>27/17th.</HI> of <HI>September</HI> being Friday, the great Cro&s;s erected on the Wall was after midnight taken down, and advice given to the Venetians, &s;o &s;oon as the morn|ing dawned, that the Turks did that day at|tend the Surrender, which was accordingly performed by the Principal Citizen about nine of the clock of the &s;ame morning who offer|ing the Keys of the City to the Great Vizier in a Ba&s;on of Silver on the breach of St. <HI>Andrea,</HI> was by him pre&s;ented with a Ve&s;t of Sables, and five hundred Zechins in Gold, and to his Servants were given two hundred. To <HI>Moro&s;ini</HI> al&s;o a Pre&s;ent was offered worthy his Quality; but he refu&s;ed it, &s;aying, That he would never give a &s;eeming occa&s;ion to the malicious World to &s;lander him with the lea&s;t appearance of having &s;old his important Charge. Whil&s;t the&s;e things were tran&s;acting on the breach, &s;ome of the mo&s;t cowardly and di&s;|orderly among&s;t the Jani&s;aries pre&s;&s;ed forward to have entred by force, in violation of the Articles &s;o lately agreed and confirmed; but &s;ome of the Garri&s;on not yet imbarked, keeping them&s;elves &s;till on the Guard, repul&s;ed the mo&s;t forward in the Riot by killing three or four of their Companions: which di&s;tur|bance and in&s;olence of the Souldiery, when made known to the Vizier, he a&s;&s;embled the di&s;orderly together; and fir&s;t upbraiding their cowardi&s;e, who dur&s;t not enter in the time of War, would now counterfeit Valour in the time of Peace, &s;entenced fifteen of them to be impaled on the breach, which piece of Ju&s;tice

This rumour being appea&s;ed, the <HI>Topegiba&s;hee</HI> and <HI>Cebegiba&s;hee,</HI> or the Generals of the Ordnance and Arms took quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Forts and Cannon of the City, and whil&s;t the Turks entred over the breach, the Chri&s;tian Army withdrew and imbarked them&s;elves as fa&s;t as convenience and decency would permit, who after the departure of the French, and of &s;uch who accompanied them, were not com|puted to be above two thou&s;and five hundred men, and tho&s;e &s;ickly, ill accoutred, and half naked; and thus this City and whole I&s;land became &s;ubject and a prey to the Ottoman Arms. Among&s;t the Officers which took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Town were the Tefterdar and the Aga of the Jani&s;aries. The Tefterdar as he pa&s;&s;ed over the breach of St. <HI>Andrea,</HI> and ob&s;erving how low and weak the Works were on that &s;ide, turned to the Aga of the Jani|&s;aries, and with &s;ome di&s;dain &s;aid to him, We have here &s;pent ten days in the Surrender of this Town which we might have taken in two hours.</P>
<P>The Turki&s;h Army taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion on Fri|day the <HI>27/17th.</HI> of <HI>September,</HI> the Vizier made his Entry on Friday the <HI>4th.</HI> of <HI>October;</HI> in which time they had erected a triumphant Bridge over the breach of St. <HI>Andrea,</HI> on which the Vizier entred into the Town, and pa&s;&s;ed directly to the Church of St. <HI>Francis,</HI> which was converted to a Mahometan Mo&s;ch, where having &s;aid his Namaz or Prayer, he went to the hou&s;e where the Marque&s;s St. <HI>Andrea</HI> was lodged, which was prepared for him, with a &s;umptuous Entertainment of five hundred Di&s;hes at the ex|pence of the Grand Signior.</P>
<P>This City in four parts of five was ruined and demoli&s;hed in the time of the Siege, all the Bells and Ornaments of the Churches and Hou&s;es to the very Locks of the doors were carried away; the Arms remaining were old and ru&s;ty, and not above three hundred and fifty Pieces of Cannon left on the Walls, and tho&s;e for the mo&s;t part very &s;mall: the Inhahitants remain|ing were only five, as we have &s;aid before, un|le&s;s &s;ome few decrepit Jews and Greeks, which might make up the number of about thirty; &s;o that never could be a more &s;ad &s;pectacle of de&s;o|lation, nor a more clear Mirror of the mi&s;eries of War.</P>
<P>The Great Vizier being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Town, di&s;patched away an Expre&s;s with the good News thereof to the Sultan, who po&s;ted as fa&s;t as wind and weather would permit. And here the Reader may ea&s;ily apprehend what joy po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed the minds of the Turks in all places where the rumour flew of this Cities Surrender, which had for &s;o many years baffled and put a &s;tand to the Ottoman Sword, And though the joyful tidings added wings to the Me&s;&s;en|gers ha&s;t, yet the uncertainty of the Grand Signiors abode retarded &s;ome dayes the arrival of the News: which will &s;eem very &s;trange to him that con&s;iders, that the motion of &s;o great an Emperour in the Glory of his Fortunes &s;hould be le&s;s ob&s;cure than the light of the Sun, perceptible by all conditions, who inhabit that &s;ide of the Globe, where his rays are vi&s;ible. At length the Me&s;&s;enger found the Sultan with|in the Woods and Mountains of <HI>Nogyopont</HI> where he had pa&s;&s;ed the heats of the Summer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The News brought to the Grand Signior at <HI>Negro|pont.</HI></NOTE> and &s;ome part of his di&s;content in tho&s;e &s;olitary retirements: it being now towards the end of <HI>September,</HI> and the Winter approaching, the I&s;le was incapable to entertain &s;o great a Court, and to return back &s;eemed as di&s;honourable as it was dangerous, the Souldiery and People being equally di&s;contented, the one by the ill &s;ucce&s;s and government of Affairs, and the o|ther by oppre&s;&s;ion of Taxes: but this joyful News cleared all tho&s;e clouds and ombrages of doubtful and di&s;con&s;olate thoughts, which the Grand Signior received like a dream, being at fir&s;t &s;o &s;urpri&s;ed with &s;uch an unexpected hap|pine&s;s, that he could &s;carce believe it; but at length recollecting his &s;cattered &s;pirits, without delay returned the Me&s;&s;enger again with his Embrahore or Ma&s;ter of his Hor&s;e to the Vi|zier with the Pre&s;ent of a Sable Ve&s;t, a Dag|ger, and a Sword, being the u&s;ual &s;ignals of the Sultans favour, and with a Letter freighted with Encomiums and Prai&s;es of his Valour and Fortune. And whereas the Vizier had per|&s;waded him to return to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> he an&s;wered, That he was re&s;olved to winter at <HI>Salonica,</HI> where with the Spring he expected his pre&s;ence, and from thence in company with him, &s;hould be ready to chu&s;e any Seat, which in his judgment the Vizier apprehended mo&s;t conducing to the benefit of the Empire.</P>
<P>The Captain-General <HI>Moro&s;ini</HI> having in the mean time imbarked his Forces, &s;ailed to <HI>Suda</HI> to provide and fortifie that place, <HI>Spina Longa</HI> and <HI>Carabu&s;a,</HI> poor Rocks and Appendages to the greater I&s;le of <HI>Candia,</HI> with all nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies of Victuals and Ammunition: which only &s;erve for a Pro&s;pect into <HI>Candia,</HI> and to keep alive the Title of the Venetian Republick to that Kingdom. <HI>Suda</HI> is the mo&s;t con&s;ide|rable of the three, but yet not &s;trong, the Sea being fordable between that and <HI>Candia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Vene|tians at <HI>Suda.</HI></NOTE> and not of long re&s;i&s;tance, when&s;oever the Turk &s;hall think it worth his time to &s;ubdue. Here <HI>Moro&s;ini</HI> attended the Ratification of the Peace from <HI>Venice,</HI> and the disbanding of the Turki&s;h Army, in which time four French Ships with Succours of Men and Ammunition arrived at <HI>Candia,</HI> but coming late were di&s;appointed of their de&s;ign, and &s;o returned back into their own Country.</P>
<P>The Turks having now fini&s;hed their work, di&s;peeded a way their Jani&s;aries and Pioniers by all occa&s;ions of &s;hipping: tho&s;e that remain|ed were imployed all the Winter in filling the Trenches without the City, and many Slaves taken out of the Gallies to repair the breach of St. <HI>Andrea:</HI> in which work, whil&s;t they threw up the difordered rubbi&s;h, &s;o poy&s;onous a &s;tench evaporated from the bodies of the &s;lain, which lay buried in tho&s;e ruines, as begat a Pe&s;tilence and other di&s;ea&s;es in the City and in the Gal|lies; but labouring continually on that work, they &s;oon acquitted them&s;elves of the contagi|on, by help of the Winters cold which then approached.</P>
<P>In this manner expired the Action of this Year, fortunate in its &s;ucce&s;s to the Turks; for though they gained but thirty Acres of Land with expence ine&s;timable of Blood and Trea&s;ure, yet the Glory and Fame which attended it, be|ing the con&s;ummation of twenty five years Wars, and the Theatre where the whole World were Spectators, was of greater value to the Turks than any other con&s;ideration, and may with time prove a place of advantage to the farther increa&s;e of their We&s;tern Empire,

<P>The Grand Signior in the mean time return|ed to <HI>Salonica</HI> to pa&s;s the remainder of the Winter, which place being famous for multi|tude of all &s;orts of Game,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>G.</HI> Signior returns to <HI>Salonica,</HI> and hunts.</NOTE> drew is heart, and made him impatient till he arrived tho&s;e Plains, more de&s;ired by him than the Ely&s;ian fields; for having made his Entry into that City, the next day he de&s;igned to hunt: but being put in mind that the Engli&s;h Amba&s;&s;adour Sir <HI>Daniel Harvey,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir <HI>Daniel Harvey,</HI> his Maje|&s;ties Am|ba&s;&s;adour, hath his Audience of the Grand Sig|nior.</NOTE> who (as we &s;aid) arrived at <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople</HI> the year before, attended his Audience, he was contented to grant it to him the next morning.

How&s;oever he was not in &s;o much ha&s;te, but he te&s;tified due re&s;pect to His Maje&s;ty of Great <HI>Britain,</HI> and the e&s;teem he had of the Engli&s;h Nation, or|dering the Capitulations to be renewed; and commanding the Chimacam, that if any one &s;hould break or infringe them, that he &s;hould cut him off without farther argument. But as to renewing the Capitulations, the Chimacam falling at the Grand Signiors feet, be&s;eeched him, That that particular might be deferred until the arrival of the Great Vizier, who&s;e proper power and act it was to make War and Peace; and therefore for him to intermeddle about Capitulations was to invade the Viziers, Authority, which he dur&s;t not do without put|ting his life in danger, or at lea&s;t rendring his Per&s;on obnoxious to his irreconcileable di&s;plea|&s;ure; with which the Grand Signior being &s;a|tisfied, ordered that the renewing of the Ca|pitulations &s;hould be deferred until the return of the Vi&s;iier, and &s;o di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the Lord Amba&s;|&s;adour from his Pre&s;ence; but this work of re|newing the Capitulations was re&s;erved for the care and conduct of Sir <HI>John Finch,</HI> who &s;uc|ceeded in the Emba&s;&s;y after the death of Sir <HI>Danil Harvey.</HI></P>
<P>The Grand Signior ari&s;ing from his Throne mounted into his Saddle to follow his exce&s;&s;ive delight in Hunting, which now he pur&s;ued e|very day without re&s;pect of cold or wet, or Hor&s;es or Attendants; but like an impetuous <HI>Nimrod</HI> raged among&s;t the timorous Hares and flying Harts, over-&s;preading the Woods with va&s;t numbers of poor Jews and Pea&s;ants, which he had commanded forth to drive for Game, not re&s;pecting the extreme rigour and Fro&s;ts of Winter, by which many of tho&s;e poor Wretches lying abroad in the nights, were benumbed, and dyed. And &s;o far did his humour tran&s;port him in this Recreation, that he was di&s;couraged at no inconvenience or labours which attended it; for one day appointing his Hunting at a certain place, which to pa&s;s on Hor&s;e-back was a great circuit, but a near|er cut over a Gulf or Arm of the Sea, he ordered his Hor&s;es round, whil&s;t he in Per&s;on attended with the Chimacam and &s;everal of his Grandees, pa&s;&s;ed over to the other &s;ide in a Gally. But being impatient of his Sport, and not able to give time to his Hor&s;es to make their way, a&s;cended his Gally, commanding them to row away with all &s;peed; and arriving at the other &s;ide &s;ome hours before His Hor&s;es could come, would yet land: and being weary of expectation, re&s;olved to meet them on foot through all the dirt and mire of a low and rich &s;oil: where whil&s;t he travelled heavily, and almo&s;t tried, by good fortune they e&s;pied a Miller driving his Hor&s;e laden with two Sacks of Meal; whom when they had called, and made him to lighten his burden, and take off the Pack-&s;addle, the Chimacam him&s;elf &s;tripped off his own Sables Ve&s;t, and covered the Hor&s;e with it, on which the Grand Signior mounting in great &s;tate, rode like a Prince till he met his own Retinue, which pa&s;&s;age &s;erved to fill the di&s;cour&s;e at night of that days Hunting, and de&s;erves to be chronicled with our Engli&s;h Dialogue between the Miller and the King: how&s;oever we make u&s;e of it here to demon|&s;trate the &s;trange and pa&s;&s;ionate humour which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed this Sultan in his Hunt|ing.</P>

But the Vizier admitted no Audience for Complaints, whether it were to maintain an apprehen&s;ion of his clemency and gentlene&s;s, by acting nothing that was cruel or &s;evere, or to enjoy him&s;elf after his cares and turmoils in the War; he almo&s;t for four|teen days continuance entertained him&s;elf in private by the cool and cry&s;talline Fountains of <HI>Scio.</HI> Some report, that he gave him&s;elf at that time &s;o exce&s;&s;ively to Wine, being over|joyed at his &s;ucce&s;s, and conclu&s;ion of the War, that he was never capable, during his abode there, of &s;erious thoughts or coun&s;els; &s;o that his Kahya, or Secretary, could hever be ad+mitted acce&s;s, unle&s;s he were called, though on the mo&s;t urgent occa&s;ion of bu&s;ine&s;s. Others interpreted his retirements to be in order to &s;erious con&s;iderations about the management of Affairs at his return; as how to &s;atisfie the expectations of the Grandees, who patiently at|tended an amendment of abu&s;es in the Govern|ment; how he might pacifie the minds of the Souldiery, who were jealous of Cou&s;piracies again&s;t the lives of the Royal Brothers, and how to &s;teer in an even cour&s;e at Court between the &s;ecurity of his Ma&s;ter, and &s;atisfaction of the Vulgar; for all the World lived in hope that alteration of times would amend abu&s;es, and that the la&s;t remedy of all was the return of the Viziers Authority. How&s;oever, it is certainly reported, That the Vizier was become exceedingly intemperate in wine, and drowned much of his cares in the fumes and vapours of it, &s;uppo&s;ing him&s;elf, as <HI>Tiberius</HI> did in <HI>Caprea,</HI> exempt from the eyes of the World, whil&s;t he remained in <HI>Scio,</HI> which the Sea had &s;eparated from the greater Continent.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Great Vizier per|&s;waded to drink wine.</NOTE> And yet the Vizier, is believed, never to have ta&s;ted Wine, or known whether it was bitter or &s;weet, till the pride of his &s;ucce&s;s in <HI>Candia</HI> tran&s;ported him to make his joy extravagant, to which the Officers about his Per&s;on invited him, as that which cheared the &s;pirits, &s;trengthened the Nerves, and induced a &s;trange kind of delight and plea&s;ure in the fancy, beyond any thing of Poppies, or Opiate Compo&s;itions, or <HI>Biram</HI>-Pa&s;ha's Pills, or Ber&s;e, or a thou&s;and other inventions, fit only to confu&s;e mens rea&s;on, and &s;tupifie the brain, and benumb all the &s;en&s;es, in which &s;ome, as I have heard, had &s;o practi&s;ed them&s;elves by degrees, that they could &s;wallow five drams in twenty four hours, though I never knew any, unle&s;s one Turk, whom I &s;aw eat above three; but then they could eat nothing el&s;e, nor were they fit after|wards to receive or dige&s;t any other nouri&s;h|ment, Nature being u&s;ed to that poy&s;on, re|jected all other founder nutriment. But Wine (they &s;aid) cheared the heart in that manner, and comforted the &s;tomach, that the Turks began now generally to drink it, unle&s;s he were &s;ome Phari&s;aical Hypocrite of the Ula|mah, or &s;ome &s;uper&s;titious aged and ignorant Profe&s;&s;or.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Soul|diers and other Turks drink Wine to exce&s;s.</NOTE> So that the vice of drunkenne&s;s be|came more common among&s;t the Turks, than a|mong&s;t the Germans, or our &s;elves: I am &s;ure more intolerable, and admini&s;tred to more mi&s;|chiefs, by how much the Turks being unac|cu&s;tomed to Wine, knew le&s;s how to com|port the heats of Intemperance.</P>
<P>And here I &s;hall make a little digre&s;&s;ion from my purpo&s;e in hand to acquaint my Reader of the effects which I have ob&s;erved to be produced in tho&s;e who accu&s;tom them&s;elves to the u&s;e of Opium.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A digre&s;&s;i|on about Opium.</NOTE> In all the Country Vil|lages among&s;t the Turks, the more aged &s;ort of men who have mo&s;t lei&s;ure, and lea&s;t nece&s;&s;ity to work, addict them&s;elves to Opium for alleviation (as they &s;ay) of their cares, and to forget their &s;orrow, for plea&s;ure in the ta&s;te there can be none, being very bitter to the palate; which being taken in a morning in a &s;mall quantity, about the bigne&s;s of a Tare, &s;uperinduces at fir&s;t a &s;trange chear|fulne&s;s about the heart, and thence rai&s;es a more plea&s;ing vapor to the head, than any
<PB N="224" REF="114">can proceed from the &s;pirits of the be&s;t and the highe&s;t Wines: but afterwards as it begins to dige&s;t, the vapour becomes more gro&s;s, and con&s;equently a kind of &s;tupefaction is induced over the brain and nerves, which with drow&s;ine&s;s and &s;leep pa&s;&s;es away like a drunken fit. The Youth among&s;t them which drink Wine abhor Opium, until growing into years, and to the care of a family (as a &s;ign of which they &s;uffer their beards to increa&s;e) they are taught by their Imaum, and more by example of others, that Wine being again&s;t their Law, is only di&s;|pen&s;able in wild and unbridled Youth, but in tho&s;e of riper age is a vice to be reproached by all &s;ober and well-governed men. In the place of which they take up the lawful and innocent Pill of Opium, which makes men &s;erious and &s;etled (as they &s;ay) becau&s;e that it operates not like Wine, which makes men mad, and ra&s;h, and violent, but di&s;po&s;es them to be Sots, and to &s;it grave and quiet without doing hurt to any man, which is a qualification accounted very laudable among&s;t them, and is one of the greate&s;t Vertues which they endeavour to ac|quire in their Teke&eacute;s or Mona&s;teries. This being the rea&s;on for which it is taken and allow|ed, it is grown a common cu&s;tom almo&s;t a|mong&s;t all the Country-people, who in the morning before they go to work take fir&s;t their Opium, and upon it three or four di&s;hes of Coffee; for it is ob&s;ervable, that none eats Opium but who accompanies it with great quantities of Coffee, which is doubtle&s;s a kind of Opiate in it &s;elf, and partakes very much of a Narcotick Quality; by this means and con&s;tant u&s;e &s;ome arrive to take &s;trange quan|tities; the mo&s;t that ever I knew any man take was three drams in twenty four hours, <HI>viz.</HI> a dram and a half or thereabouts in the morning, and as much an hour afternoon: the which for more exactne&s;s I had the curio&s;ity to &s;ee weighed. The &s;ame per&s;on offered for a &s;mall reward to take five drams in twenty four hours; but then he &s;aid, it required a long time to dige&s;t, and did not doubt but to over|come it: but I was too &s;crupulous to put a man into a &s;leep, from whence I feared he might never awake. This per&s;on was of a thin and livid complexion, his skin &s;hriveled, no more beard than a few hairs, his mouth commonly open, becau&s;e his chap was fallen; his counte|nance putting me often in mind of the Picture I have &s;een of the <HI>Gorgons</HI> head; for had it been incompa&s;&s;ed with Snakes in&s;tead of his Turbant, it might have &s;erved for a perfect Original. He had arrived to the years of forty eight, and from the years thirty he had entred into Opium from great exce&s;s of Wine: in which condition he found that his &s;tomach required littled other nouri&s;hment, being content with a &s;mall quantity of bread and water for his other Diet, Opium &s;upplying him with all the other Delicacies he could de|&s;ire: he was the father notwith&s;tanding of two or three children, which he confe&s;&s;ed to have begot in the &s;trength of his Opium, having no de&s;ire to accompany with his wife, until he was fir&s;t invigorated with his u&s;ual Do&s;e, being till then like a Trunk or Log, wanting &s;pirits almo&s;t to turn his body. For his Opium was that only which could revive all, which about a quarter of an hour after it was taken began to operate, and then we di&s;covered in his eyes, which before were dull and heavy, &s;carce opening, a certain quickne&s;s and &s;parkling, and then &s;oon after he was fitted for the work of the day, and could labour as others, and take a journey on foot of &s;even or eight miles to Market, and return home at night: his body was always bound, or his belly con&s;tipated with the hardne&s;s of his excrement, and yet he was &s;ubject to no other &s;ickne&s;s, unle&s;s his vitiated de&s;ire to this Poy&s;on which can nouri&s;h no whole&s;ome or healthful body. The Turks, as I have learned, make little other u&s;e of Opium than this; yet &s;ometimes they will put it into their Camels ears, and the no&s;trils of their Hor&s;es, when faint and weary, wherewith they revive again, and &s;oon recover their &s;trength and force to travel.</P>
<P>The Vizier having thus pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome days of Entertainment at <HI>Scio,</HI> entred again his Gally, and pa&s;&s;ing through the Streights of the <HI>Helle&s;pont</HI> arrived at <HI>Rode&s;to,</HI> where having landed many of his Jani&s;aries and &s;uch of the Army as remained with him, after a few days continuance he marched to <HI>Adrianople,</HI> where he was received by the Grand Signior with all evidences of &s;atisfaction, and entred the City triumphant after the manner of the Turki&s;h <HI>Allai.</HI></P>
<P>The Ceremonies and Complements being pa&s;t, which u&s;ually intervene between Great Per&s;onages after a long ab&s;ence, the grand Con|&s;ultation was, In what manner to prevent the &s;editious irruptions of the Souldiery, and how to reconcile the Jealou&s;ies between the Grand Signior and his Brothers. For the former, two things were concluded nece&s;&s;ary. Fir&s;t, to divide the Militia of the Jani&s;aries, which was immediately executed, and eight thou&s;and of them, under pretence of Incur&s;ions, were &s;ent through <HI>Moldavia</HI> to remain on the Fron|tiers of <HI>Poland.</HI> Secondly, it being ob&s;erved, that mo&s;t of the Souldiery drank Wine, from whence in ancient times aro&s;e many Mutinies and Seditions of the Souldiery, dangerous to the Ottoman State, as namely in the time of <HI>Mahomet</HI> III. when the Jani&s;aries in the heat of drunkenne&s;s entred the Seraglio by force, and demanded the Heads of the chief Favourites: And as then it was judged the be&s;t Expedient to cool the hot brains of the Jani&s;aries, to pro|claim a Prohibition of Wine at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and to command upon pain of death, That tho&s;e who had any Wine in their Hou&s;es &s;hould bring it forth, and &s;tave it; &s;o now the u&s;e of it was univer&s;ally forbidden in all the parts of the Grand Signiors Dominions, and a &s;pecial Command was &s;ent to all places re|&s;pectively under the penalty of death, and a thou&s;and maledictions, cur&s;ing Wine as come from Hell, and as a Liquor produced by the Devil to en&s;nare mens &s;ouls, and inebriate their heads, and confound States. And &s;o generally was this Prohibition enjoyned, that his Ma|je&s;ties Amba&s;&s;ador at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> with long &s;olicitation and charge obtained licence for his Family, and the Merchants there to make Wine; but for the Merchants at <HI>Smyrna</HI> there was more difficulty, and this year Wine was not made in their Hou&s;es according to cu&s;tom, and not without &s;cruple permitted to be imported from the Greeks I&s;lands, and other parts where the Command extended not its force; for the Prohibition was to all places where Mo&s;chs or Turks Inhabitants, the Villages or I&s;les where Chri&s;tians only lived were not included.

At Receipt of this my Royal Command know, That Wine and Games at Dice, and figured Cards, and of Arrows without feathers; which are Lotteries, are the filthine&s;s of Diabolical work (according to the te&s;timony of the miraculous Revelation) are Fomenters of malice and wickedne&s;s, and are the fer|ment of that Faction and Sedition which corrupt and &s;educe the Servants of God, which being prohibited by Authority, and yet u&s;ed, provokes the anger and di&s;dain of Almighty God again&s;t us: And whereas by this Mother of all wickedne&s;s (that is, Wine) the Mu&s;ulmin Kingdoms are defiled, there appears an evident alteration of the Mu&s;ulmin Law and Faith, and an inlet to actions of foul impre&s;&s;ion. Prai&s;ed be the high and mo&s;t great God, that in the days of my years abounding in Felicity, the ob|&s;ervation of lawful Precepts hath been con|firmed, and unlawful things have been pro|hibited; and now I know that this is the &s;um of the mo&s;t important Affair conducing to my Kingdoms and my own Felicities, and in general the principal and greatest care, and the be&s;t and mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Canon of my Empire: &s;o that being de&s;irous to &s;atisfie the Creator of the World, my Royal and immutable Will re&s;olves to clean&s;e and purifie the Mu&s;ulmin Kingdoms of this pro|hibited and filthy abomination; wherefore when this Royal Command comes to your hands, where&s;oever there are Taverns of Wine, let them be ra&s;ed and thrown down in all Cities and Towns ennobled with Mu&s;ulmin Mo&s;chs, let the buying and &s;elling thereof be prohibited, with all drinking and u&s;e of Wine; and likewi&s;e I command, That in <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople, Bru&s;a,</HI> and <HI>Adrianople</HI> the Impo&s;i|tion thereupon be wholly taken off. And that in all other Cities and Towns adorned with Mu&s;ulmin Mo&s;chs, there be not a drop of Wine &s;uffered or admitted in; and that Mu&s;ulmins neither privately nor &s;ecretly drink Wine; and who&s;oever is or &s;hall be Author of this &s;in, and to alter my Com|mand in this particular, either now or here|after, may he be puni&s;hed by the &V;niver&s;al Lord of all the World. Likewi&s;e when this my Command of high Reputation ap|pears, which is a Royal Writing, let it be annexed to the Decretal Rolls, and be put in execution according as it is obligatory. And when this Command comes to your hands, you are to have all due care of this injoyned particular, That it operate according to the Tenor of this Royal Injunction, partici|pating of Pro&s;perity and Majestick Power, by virtue of which you are to reprove, repre|hend, hinder, and prohibit, according to the Law of God, the drinking of Wine; and that it may be wholly taken away, let the Tax and Revenue which proceeds from thence be taken off, and in all guarded and governed Cities and places of my Kingdoms, let the Taverns be ruined and overthrown. And therefore you are to make known and publi&s;h to all Citizens and Inhabitants the force of this my Royal Command, as well in the City of <HI>Smyrna,</HI> as in other Cities and Towns ennobled with Mu&s;ulmin Mo&s;chs, and you are to ruine the Taverns which are found there.

<P>On the <HI>27th.</HI> of <HI>July</HI> the Commi&s;&s;ioners had their fir&s;t Conference in the Pa&s;ha's Tent, the Debate continued many hours with much heat; which did not only relate to the late Conque&s;ts, but new difficulties aro&s;e in regard that <HI>Ferat</HI> Aga, appointed Commi&s;&s;ioner for the Port, had in the year 1573 a&s;&s;igned Bounds and Limits to the Confines, according to his plea&s;ure and arbitrary will, which not being a&s;&s;ented unto by the Ve|netians, a new regulation was made by the &s;aid <HI>Ferat,</HI> together with Cavalier <HI>Soranzo</HI> in the year 1576. Time afterwards, and the turbu|lent &s;pirits of the Inhabitants had altered the&s;e Limits, and by rea&s;on of the long War the Land-Marks and Bounds of the Confines were re|moved or wholly de&s;troyed. The original Copies of the Writings of Agreement were rot|ted, and much defaced, the names of the places and the &s;cituations being wrote in divers Lan|guages, were confu&s;ed, and the reports of the peo|ple were &s;o different, proceeding from the diver|&s;ity of their Intere&s;ts, that little of judgment could be founded on their relations. At length, as to the Confines of <HI>Zara,</HI> it was agreed, That they &s;hould be regulated according as they were limited by <HI>Soranzo</HI> and <HI>Ferat;</HI> for better &s;et|tlement of which, and to avoid all doubtfulne&s;s or mi&s;take, the Commi&s;&s;ioners took the pains to travel &s;everal days journey in per&s;on to erect the bounds and Limits of each people; in which though many conte&s;ts and differences aro&s;e be|tween particular per&s;ons, yet at length per&s;onal intere&s;ts were forced to give way to publick de|terminations.</P>
<P>In like manner the Confines of <HI>Sebenico</HI> were determined, being bounded by the River <HI>Checa,</HI> and being arrived at <HI>Scardona,</HI> the Pa&s;ha <HI>Ma|mut</HI> de&s;ired that he might have the conveni|ence of pa&s;&s;ing in the Gally, and accordingly he was received aboard, and treated with that ge|nerous entertainment which is agreeable to the magnificence of the Republick; and landing at the River of <HI>Belulla</HI> on the Banks of the Vally <HI>Daniel,</HI> where the Pa&s;ha had placed his Tents, the Turks who with a greedy eye &s;wallowed in their thoughts the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and enjoyment of all the&s;e Plains, would have enlarged their Con|fines to tho&s;e marks which <HI>Ferat</HI> Aga had &s;ingly placed according to his own arbitrary plea&s;ure, including al&s;o <HI>Verpogly</HI> within their Li|mits.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The diffe|rence about <HI>Verpogly.</HI></NOTE> This <HI>Verpogly</HI> was a &s;mall Redoubt on the top of a Hill once belonging to the Veneti|ans, which at the begining of the War they abandoned, as co&s;ting more to maintain and defend, than the value or con&s;ideration of it; the Turks afterwards po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it, when they had a de&s;ign to be&s;iege <HI>Sebenico,</HI> but afterwards for|&s;ook it, and retired; upon this place <HI>Mamut</HI> much in&s;i&s;ted, producing a Command from the Grand Signior, ordering that it be taken in, fortified, and garri&s;oned. But <HI>Nani</HI> with more force of Argument in&s;i&s;ted on the contrary, pro|ducing ancient Writings, and undeniable Te&s;ti|monies to prove that this place did really, and of right belong to the Republick; by which though the Pa&s;ha was fully convinced in his own mind; yet being over-awed by the in&s;olent im|portunities of the Inhabitants, he was cautious and fearful of declaring his true &s;en&s;e in the ca&s;e; but rather endeavoured to overcome the Ve|netians &s;ometimes with flatteries, and anon with menances, having to that purpo&s;e, be&s;ides his own Forces, ordered the Beglerbey of <HI>Greece</HI> to approach tho&s;e Confines with an Army of about ten thou&s;and men. But all this did not move the &s;teddy Con&s;tancy of the Venetian Commi&s;&s;ioner from his rea&s;on and right; for maintenance of which he appeared firm and re|&s;olute, and being nece&s;&s;itated for convenience of Water to remove his Quarters to the Lake <HI>Rebenich,</HI> gave &s;ome jealou&s;ie to the Pa&s;ha by this retirement of an intention to break the Peace; how&s;oever, <HI>Nani</HI> declared his meaning to the contrary, and that there might be no in|terruption to their proceedings, propo&s;ed that the&s;e differences might be remitted to the Su|preme Powers; and that in the mean time, un|til an&s;wers came, they might proceed in the adju&s;tment of other parts of the Confines. But the Pa&s;ha a&s;&s;ented not hereunto, but de&s;ired rather the di&s;pute &s;hould be referred to the Port, and that in the mean time he him&s;elf &s;hould retire to <HI>Cettina,</HI> and the other to <HI>Spal|lato.</HI> Scarce were the Me&s;&s;ages &s;ent, and the Di&s;patches made (by <HI>I&s;aac</HI> Aga,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mamut</HI> Pa&s;ha dye.</NOTE> a Per&s;on whom I well knew) before <HI>Mamut</HI> Pa&s;ha, after a &s;hort indi&s;po&s;ition ended his days: he was a man of about ninety two years of age, at which years I have admired to &s;ee him ride abroad, and tran&s;act his affairs with great dexterity, with a &s;trong memory, and a &s;ound judgment. And here it is admirable to ob&s;erve with what con|&s;tancy and patience the Turki&s;h Officers do u&s;ually &s;upport their laborious employments; they contemn all difficulties and incommodiou&s;|ne&s;s of living, as if they did not feel them, in|uring them&s;elves to colds and hearts, to watch|ings and labours, being ab&s;temious in their diet, and as occa&s;ions require, not indulging to &s;leep; and no que&s;tion but this aged man travelling in the &s;calding heat of the Sun, and &s;uffering much for want of plenty, as well as of good water, dried up that little radical moi&s;ture which remained, and cau&s;ed this Autumn-fruit to fall, which perhaps might have continued a &s;hort time longer on the tree, had it not been de&s;ic|cated by drought, and &s;haken too hard by the motion of travels and labour.</P>
<P>The News of <HI>Mamut</HI> Pa&s;ha's death being arrived at the Port, a Commi&s;&s;ion was imme|diately granted to <HI>Chu&s;aein</HI> Pa&s;ha Imbrahor, or Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e to the Grand Signior, to &s;ucceed in his government and bu&s;ine&s;s of Treaty concerning the Limits of the Confines; with which Authority and In&s;tructions <HI>Chu&s;aein</HI> po&s;ted away, and being well informed by <HI>I&s;aac</HI> Aga of the ill nature and rapacious di&s;po&s;ition of tho&s;e Borderers, arrived with intentions to agree, and with courteous and benign thoughts towards-Cavalier <HI>Nani,</HI> who had gained a great e&s;teem and repute among&s;t the Turks of a generous and noble di&s;po|&s;ition.</P>

Thence proceeding to the Teritory of <HI>Trau,</HI> where was le&s;s of difficulty or trouble; for the Wars not having made much alteration in that place, the Lines were evidently de&s;cribed by <HI>Soranco,</HI> according to who&s;e de&s;cription the Fields, Plains, Rocks, and Mountains were mea|&s;ured out and, allowed.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, They came near to <HI>Spalato,</HI> where before the War there was little of any Terri|tory a&s;&s;igned; but now by the Conque&s;t of <HI>Cli&s;&s;a</HI> there was a&s;&s;igned unto it a &s;patious and fruitful Country, extending it &s;elf to the foot of the Mountains. As to <HI>Cli&s;&s;a</HI> there was no difference at all: how&s;oever the Turks would on no means admit, that the Venetians &s;hould keep <HI>Salona</HI> and <HI>&V;ragnizzo,</HI> becau&s;e by that they would cut off all communication between <HI>Cli&s;&s;a</HI> and <HI>Spalato,</HI> and thereby render it a place u&s;ele&s;s, and of more charge than benefit; and becau&s;e tho&s;e two places of <HI>Salona</HI> and <HI>&V;ragnizza</HI> had been the Dowry of a Sultana Wife of <HI>Ru&s;&s;en</HI> Pa&s;ha, and by her given to endow a Mo&s;ch, which therefore according to their Religion could not be given away, nor alienated. But <HI>Nani</HI> in|&s;i&s;ting as vigorou&s;ly on this, as on other points, &s;hewed him&s;elf re&s;olute to maintain this parti|cular, as being that, which if not granted, would certainly in a &s;hort time be occa&s;ion of tho&s;e quarrels and di&s;&s;entions, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily break forth into an open War: for that there could be no &s;ecurity of Peace to the Inhabitants of <HI>Salona,</HI> whil&s;t they lived amid&s;t their Ene|mies, and ju&s;t on the Skirts of <HI>Cli&s;&s;a, Spalato,</HI> and <HI>Sa&s;&s;o. Chu&s;aein</HI> having well comprehended this con&s;ideration, and being de&s;irous to di&s;po&s;e matters towards a durable Peace, &s;lighted the opinion and &s;en&s;e of the Borderers, and &s;o con|cluded all matters, and in pre&s;ence of <HI>Nani</HI> &s;ub&s;cribed the Agreement on the <HI>24th.</HI> of <HI>October</HI> in open Divan held in the Campagne of <HI>Salona;</HI> the which was al&s;o mutually &s;ub&s;cribed, and Copies interchangeably given. And in this man|ner the difference about the Confines was con|cluded, and the long War between <HI>Venice</HI> and the Turks had an end.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t all things were reducing them&s;elves into a po&s;ture of Peace, the Timariots disband|ed, and the Jani&s;aries retired to their Cham|bers, in the month of <HI>October</HI> returned the Turks Envoy&eacute; from <HI>France,</HI> bringing with him an Amba&s;&s;adour from that King called Mon|&s;ieur <HI>De Nointel,</HI> a Per&s;on of an excellent tem|per, grave and &s;erious in his Treaties and com|portment; and to give this Emba&s;&s;y the greater reputation, he was attended with three Men of War and a Fire-&s;hip, which &s;ailing along the <HI>Helle&s;pont</HI> and <HI>Propontick</HI> without oppo&s;ition, came to an Anchor near &s;even Towers, from whence &s;ending advice of their arrival to the Chimacam demanded to be re&s;aluted by the Seraglio, they promi&s;ing as they pa&s;&s;ed to &s;hew the fir&s;t demon&s;trations of courte&s;ie; but that being denied, as no u&s;ual or cu&s;tomary, the French Ships pa&s;&s;ed the Seraglio &s;ilently without firing a Gun, or any &s;ignifications on either &s;ide, whether of Friend&s;hip of Ho&s;tility: the Ships came to an Anchor at <HI>Fonducl&eacute;,</HI> where the Amba&s;&s;adour remained aboard un&s;aluted and unacknowledged by the publick Mini&s;ters of the City; until the Great Vizier, who &s;uppo&s;|ed that a breach with <HI>France</HI> ought to have bet|ter foundation than a meer Punctilio of Ho|nour, &s;eemed more to de&s;pi&s;e than take notice of the affront. For he who knew &s;o well to di&s;&s;emble, after he had &s;een the French Troops ranged both in <HI>Hungary</HI> and <HI>Candia,</HI> again&s;t the Ottoman Forces, and yet politickly connived thereat, and acepted an excu&s;e, did not e&s;teem it prudence to ground a War for want of the &s;moke of a few Guns; but on the contrary or|dered, That the Amba&s;&s;adour &s;hould be received with the u&s;ual Form and Solemnity of Recep|tion. The French having the advantage by this &s;ucce&s;s, the Souldiers and Sea-men belonging to the Ships committed many in&s;olencies in <HI>Pera</HI> and <HI>Calata,</HI> which never were revenged or ac|counted for; and when the Ships departed, above an hundred Slaves e&s;caped from the Gallies and parts of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and gained Sanctuary aboard: among&s;t the re&s;t one Mon|&s;ieur <HI>De Beau-jeu</HI> a Knight of <HI>Malta,</HI> who had for a long time been Pri&s;oner in the &s;even Tow|ers; but at length knocking off his Irons, and by help of a Cord letting him&s;elf down from one of the highe&s;t Towers in the night, recovered the Ships, and regained his liberty. Nor yet did this nor other affronts, whereby the French did really brave the Turks, admini&s;ter &s;ufficient &s;ubject of choler to the Vizier; for pa&s;&s;ing all by, as if nothing had been done, or nothing worthy his notice, frankly gave his Orders to let the Ships pa&s;s the Ca&s;tles, which upon the foregoing cau&s;es and pretences had been before detained: adding, That it was natural, as well for men as for birds, to endeavour to procure their liberty, and therefore were not blameable but that tho&s;e to who&s;e care they were commit|ted, wanting due circum&s;pection and vigilance in their Office, &s;hould pay for the e&s;cape of their charge by the price of their own lives or liberties.</P>
<P>The French Amba&s;&s;adour in the mean time proceeded in his Journey to <HI>Adrianople,</HI> where the Court re&s;ided; and having pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;everal degrees and Punctilio's of Vi&s;its and other Ceremonies, at length de&s;cending to mat|ters of bu&s;ine&s;s, propo&s;ed the renovation of the Articles of Peace, with an addition of thirty two Particulars to be altered or adjoyn|ed. The Vizier who all this time kept more in his heart than he evidenced in his counte|nance, refu&s;ed to conde&s;cend to a conce&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t ea&s;ie and rea&s;onable of their demands, offering only to renew the Capitulations <HI>ver|batim</HI> according to the Tenour of the ancient Cannon, without other alteration than the Name of the pre&s;ent Sultan, and the Date of the Month and Year, and herein he was &s;o con|&s;tant and fixed, that no arguments or colours of rea&s;on could &s;eem to move him in the mo&s;t minute and le&s;s important points of circum|&s;tances; and this perhaps le&s;t the World
<PB N="229" REF="116" MS="y">&s;hould imagine, that the Turks were affrighted into Terms and better Treatments of Friend|&s;hip, or that Immunities and Privileges in the Ottoman Court were acquired rather by rude u&s;age adjoyned with menaces and neglects, than by more candid and fawning Addre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>In this manner the French Affairs rather went back than forwards in the Ottoman Court, and it &s;eemed that the Turks late Em|ba&s;&s;y into <HI>France</HI> and of the French to the Port &s;erved to augment the differences more than allay them. For the new Amba&s;&s;ador falling &s;hort in his expectation, having obtained nothing of tho&s;e many Particulars which he demanded, retired male-content from <HI>Adria|nople</HI> to his u&s;ual Re&s;idence at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> where he re&s;olved to attend what farther In|&s;tructions &s;hould be given him from <HI>France;</HI> and &s;uppo&s;ing his Ma&s;ter would ill re&s;ent his u&s;age &s;o contrary to what was promi&s;ed in general terms, did &s;uppo&s;e, that his next Orders would be of revocation, and that tho&s;e frequent di&s;gu&s;ts and di&s;re&s;pects &s;o often re|ceived, and given on one &s;ide and the other, would at length bur&s;t out into an open defiance. The Turks apprehended &s;o much them&s;elves, and as their affairs and de&s;igns proved after|wards with <HI>Poland,</HI> they were di&s;plea&s;ed that they had given the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King &s;o ju&s;t an occa&s;ion of quarrel: for under&s;tanding to|wards the latter end of the Year 1671. that great Preparations for War were making in <HI>France</HI> both by Sea and Land, they were con|&s;cious that their demerits had ju&s;tly de&s;erved the cha&s;ti&s;ement of the French Arms, in re|venge of the many injuries they had offered that Nation, and therefore pau&s;ed a while, and ob&s;erved the motion of the&s;e Enemies, before they would engage them&s;elves in a War with <HI>Poland.</HI> But at length the beginning of the Year 1672. having di&s;covered the de&s;igns of <HI>France</HI> to be only intended again&s;t <HI>Holland,</HI> the Turks rea&s;&s;umed their purpo&s;es &s;o long premeditated again&s;t <HI>Poland,</HI> with an arrogance natural to Turks, and with a &s;corn not only of <HI>France,</HI> but of all Chri&s;tendom. For his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty judging perhaps, that the rude treatment of an Infidel Prince &s;o far remote, intrenched not &s;o much on his Honour and Intere&s;t, as the quarrel he had with the neighbouring States, &s;eemed to contemn for the pre&s;ent, or rather to defer the revenge of former injuries until a more fit and commo|dious &s;ea&s;on; wherefore in the mean time his Amba&s;&s;ador upon new In&s;tructions from <HI>France</HI> brought purpo&s;ely by a Man of War, repaired a &s;econd time to <HI>Adrianople,</HI> where he inti|mated unto the chief Mini&s;ters the great de&s;ire his Ma&s;ter had to maintain that League and Friend&s;hip, which for above an hundred years had continued inviolate and uninterrutped: and therefore waving all other former Particulars of demand, declared him&s;elf &s;atisfied, only to renew the Capitulations, with that &s;ingle altera|tion of their Cu&s;toms from five to three in the hundred, according to that Priviledge which the Engli&s;h and all other Chri&s;tian Merchants enjoyed, who&s;e League and Friend&s;hip was &s;ub&s;equent to that of others. The Great Vizier being now freed of that &s;u&s;picion and fear he apprehended of the French Fleet, and being a&s;&s;ured that their Arms were not now probable to di&s;turb him in his de&s;igns intended, he &s;eriou&s;ly &s;miled in his &s;leeve at the&s;e Addre&s;&s;es, and with a kind of &s;corning neglect bid the Amba&s;&s;ador welcome to the Court, &s;aying, That he &s;hould have what he de&s;ired. Where|fore the Capitulations were tran&s;cribed, and the alteration made in the value of their Cu&s;toms; but the Vizier who meant nothing le&s;s than to yield them this Priviledge, defer|red the &s;igning thereof from day to day, paci|fying the daily importunity of the Amba&s;&s;a|dor with dilatory excu&s;es, until at length having protracted the time to the very day that the Grand Signior and he began their March towards <HI>Poland,</HI> without &s;o much as granting the Amba&s;&s;ador a per&s;onal Audience, did then with &s;oft and gentle words &s;ignifie to the Interpreters the grand pre&s;&s;ures of his Affairs at pre&s;ent, that would not permit him time to perfect all matters with the Amba&s;&s;adour, whom they &s;hould a&s;&s;ure, that at his return with Glory and Victory from the Enterprizes in hand, tho&s;e reque&s;ts &s;hould be granted, and his promi&s;es performed; and in the mean time his Nation &s;hould remain &s;ecure in the&s;e Do|minions, as in former times, and the League and Friend&s;hip continued and maintained. The Amba&s;&s;ador was &s;trangely &s;urpri&s;ed at this la&s;t Farewel; but being a Gentleman of great Morality and Vertue, knew, no doubt, how to bear &s;uch a di&s;appointment with an equality of mind agreeable to the greatne&s;s of his Soul; and therefore with a due re&s;entment of the in|jury received, he returned to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> whil&s;t the Sultan and his Vizier proceeded in their March towards the Confines of <HI>Poland.</HI></P>
<P>But before I enter into a relation of the mo|tives of that War, and the &s;ucce&s;s thereof, which is the Subject of the following Year, let us return to the place from whence we have digre&s;&s;ed, and ob&s;erve in this Year of Peace and repo&s;e of this Empire, what the Sultan con|trived for &s;ecurity of him&s;elf by the death of his Brothers.</P>

But now the Vizier being re|turned from the Wars, and the mo&s;t &s;editious among&s;t the Jani&s;aries withdrawn from <HI>Con|&s;tantinople,</HI> it was thought fit to make a new attempt on the Princes &s;till re&s;iding in the old Seraglio, which was performed with tho&s;e duc preparations and &s;ecrecy, that it took effect on Sultan <HI>Orchan,</HI> the elde&s;t of the two, who in the Month of <HI>September,</HI> 1671.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sultan <HI>Or|chan</HI> put to death by his Bro|ther.</NOTE> dyed by a draught of poy&s;on, which was ad|mini&s;tred to him as a Pre&s;ent from his cour|teous Brother; &s;ome &s;ay he was &s;trangled, and that before he &s;ubmitted his neck to the Bow|&s;tring, he killed one of the Executioners with his Hanjarre. This Prince was reported by the people to be a comely Per&s;on, of a &s;trong and robu&s;tious body, of large and black eyes like Sultan <HI>Morat:</HI> his death was lamented by all, and pre&s;aged as fatal to the Empire, in re|gard that that very night that he was murthered the Moon &s;uffered a greater Eclip&s;e than it had done for many years before, which happening out in this conjuncture was interpreted as omi|nous, and &s;erved to increa&s;e the maledictions and evil &s;peeches, which the Turks in all places

For the Trade of <HI>Genoua</HI> being cheifly founded on hopes of tho&s;e advantages which they expected from a coar&s;e or ba&s;e alloy of mony, did in|&s;tantly decay &s;o &s;oon as the Turks di&s;covered them&s;elves to be abu&s;ed by the va&s;t quantities of Temins imported, as we have before related: after which their profit failing, the Con&s;ulage con&s;equently decayed, which is the only &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence and encouragement of &s;uch Officers as are nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;ide for the continuance of that Peace, which but a few years before they unadvi&s;edly made with the Turk. The new Re&s;ident had no &s;ooner arrived at <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople,</HI> and con&s;idered the poor and mean e&s;tate and ill foundation of their Trade, the grow|ing charge of the Re&s;idency, and the great debts thereof that were to devolve upon him from his Predece&s;&s;or; but he perceived into what a Labyrinth of troubles he had ingulfed him&s;elf, in&s;tead of being preferred according to his hopes into a place of Honour and happy retirement. In which confu&s;ion of thoughts ari&s;ing one morning before day from his bed, and &s;itting on his Clo&s;e-&s;tool (as the &s;ervants of the hou&s;e report) reached at a Towel, which being intangled within the Lock of a Carbine that hanged always charged near his bed, un|fortunately drew the Trigger too hard, which with that gave fire, and &s;hot the poor Gentle|man into the belly with a brace of Bullets, of which being mortally wounded, after Con|fe&s;&s;ion and &s;ome Prayers in a few hours he pa&s;&s;ed to another life: unhappy mi&s;chance, if it may be called a chance; for I have under|&s;tood from a &s;ober per&s;on of that Nation, that the angui&s;h of mind which he conceived at the evil condition of his Affairs, wrought in him a deepne&s;s of melancholy and de&s;pair, under which langui&s;hing &s;ome days, did at la&s;t mo&s;t mi&s;erably lay violent hands upon him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>And now it is time to recal to mind the Con|&s;piracy of Count <HI>Serini,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Con|&s;piracy of <HI>Serini, Frangi|pani,</HI> and <HI>Nada&s;ti.</HI></NOTE> Marque&s;s <HI>Frangipani,</HI> and Count <HI>Nada&s;ti,</HI> Per&s;ons of Quality and of great Power in <HI>Croatia</HI> and <HI>Hungary,</HI> who (as we &s;aid before) had &s;ent their Me&s;&s;engers to the Great Vizier then remaining in the Leagure of <HI>Candia,</HI> with overtures of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Ottoman Power. It was &s;trange News to the World to hear that the Hou&s;e of <HI>Serini</HI> &s;hould abandon the Chri&s;tian Party, and tho&s;e re|nowned Defenders of their Country &s;hould apo&s;tatize, though not from Chri&s;tianity, yet from that Cau&s;e and Liberty which their An|ce&s;tors and them&s;elves had defended with Blood, Trea&s;ure, Valour, and Con&s;tancy. But di&s;&s;entions and animo&s;ities &s;own by Satan, the Enemy of the Chri&s;tian Church, did &s;trangely corrupt the minds of tho&s;e famous Per&s;ons, and rai&s;e in them a Spirit re&s;olved to avenge the neglect and injuries put upon them by the Mini&s;ters of the Imperial Court, though at the expence and hazard of their fortunes and lives, and ruine and &s;hiprack of their Honour and Con&s;ciences: For the neglects and affronts unde&s;ervedly ca&s;t on <HI>Nicholas Serini</HI> during the late War (as before related) and the con|tempt and &s;corn put on the Croatian and Hun|garian Nobility, was &s;uppo&s;ed to have fired the hot and ambitious Spirit of the&s;e Per&s;ons, who could more ea&s;ily endure the &s;lavery of the Turki&s;h yoke, than conde&s;cend to the Go|vernment and prevalency of a contrary Party. Wherefore in pro&s;ecution of their de&s;ign, the complices of <HI>Serini</HI> being re&s;olved to &s;ubmit to the Turk, di&s;patched two other Gentlemen to the Ottoman Court (be&s;ides tho&s;e which were &s;ent the year before to <HI>Salonica</HI>) who arrived at <HI>Adrianople</HI> the <HI>11th</HI> of <HI>February</HI> 1670/1 de|manding the protection of the Sultan, for which they promi&s;ed a Tribute of thirty Pur&s;es, or fifteen thou&s;and Dollars every year for tho&s;e Lands they held in <HI>Croatia.</HI> To make An&s;wer hereunto a Divan or Council was called, in which were weighed all the Arguments and Rea&s;ons on one &s;ide and the other. The Muftee oppo&s;ed their receiving into protection, as being again&s;t the Capitulations and Agree|ment &s;o lately concluded with the Emperor, wherein the receiving or abetting of Rebels is expre&s;ly forbidden, and provided again&s;t by one &s;ide and the other; but <HI>Vanni Efendi</HI> the Preacher who u&s;ed to be always of a different opinion to the Muftee, urged to have them re|ceived, becau&s;e that the advancement of the Mahometan Cau&s;e, and enlargement of their Empire was more &s;acred than the con&s;ervation of their League with an Infidel Prince. And that the Ottoman Court was no longer to be termed the Refuge of the World, if it could not yield that protection which oppre&s;&s;ed King|doms and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Princes petitioned to obtain. In this manner the matter being controverted without Agreement, it was in fine re&s;olved to refer the matter to the determination of the Grand Vizier, who was now a few months pa&s;t return'd triumphant from <HI>Candia.</HI> But by this time Intelligence being come by way of <HI>Bo&s;na,</HI> that the Emperor had already entered <HI>Croatia</HI> with thirty thou&s;and men, that he had taken <HI>Chiacheturno</HI> in <HI>Cotoriba,</HI> and that <HI>Serini</HI> and his A&s;&s;ociates were taken already or fled, either to <HI>Vienna</HI> to beg pardon of the Em|peror, or <HI>Tran&s;ylvania,</HI> or to &s;ome other place, that the Marque&s;s of <HI>Bada</HI> had fortified <HI>Sequas</HI> and other Ca&s;tles of <HI>Serini</HI> with German Gar|ri&s;ons; the Turks e&s;teemed it too late to ad|mini&s;ter help to this de&s;perate cau&s;e, and there|fore refu&s;ed to own the Partronage of a People, to whom they could neither pretend by Rea|&s;on, nor defend by Arms. The Vizier al&s;o like the Fox, contemned tho&s;e Grapes which he could not reach, and with an abhorrency as it were of the Revolt or the Rebellion, as a zealous Hater of all perfidiou&s;ne&s;s, refu&s;ed to afford protection to any of the Complices in the late Confederacy, which he politickly de|&s;igned in reference to the Emperor, who&s;e friend&s;hip he would &s;eem to con&s;erve mo&s;t faithfully, le&s;t he &s;hould interrupt him in the carrying on of that War, which he then medi|tated again&s;t <HI>Poland.</HI> But what became after|wards of the&s;e Con&s;pirators is the &s;ubject mat|ter of the German Hi&s;tory, it is &s;ufficient to acquaint the Reader here that their de&s;ign be|ing

We &s;hall therefore leave the&s;e men to render the next account to the Judge of all things, and pro&s;ecute our Relation of the Wars of <HI>Poland,</HI> which now was the next prize held up to the Turki&s;h Militia, and was that adventure which was to con&s;ummate the glories of the Great Vizier.

<P>WE have formerly acquainted you how coar&s;ely the Chimacam of <HI>Adrianople</HI> had in the year 1667 treated the Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>Poland,</HI> who came to complain of the in|cur&s;ions made into their Country by the Tar|tars; de&s;iring that not only &s;atisfaction might be made for the late &s;poils, but that that un|ruly and &s;avage people might be re&s;trained from the like Attempt for the future. But the Vizier being now returned in per&s;on it was thought nece&s;&s;ary, That to pre&s;erve this gro&s;s Body of Empire from corruption, it &s;hould be exerci&s;ed with motion, and the vigorous agita|tions of a new War.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Turks deliberate of a War.</NOTE> To what place they &s;hould now convert or employ their Arms, was the important &s;ubject of a grand Con&s;ul|tation; they had lately made up a peace with the Venetians, &s;o that on that &s;ide it was too early to make an irruption, the parts of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> were too remote and di&s;tant to carry on a War with &s;ucce&s;s and plea&s;ure; the fields of <HI>Hungary</HI> had been lately traced, and they were &s;atiated with the blood of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> and <HI>Germany;</HI> &s;ome|thing now of novelty mu&s;t be propo&s;ed, and the forgotten ways of <HI>Poland</HI> mu&s;t be again opened, there being &s;omething, it &s;eems, of wantonne&s;s in pro&s;perous Arms, which delight in variety, and abhor as much to fight often in the &s;ame Country, as Travellers do to &s;ee the &s;ame place twice. The Polanders had unto this day &s;o pre&s;erved the Limits of their Country with honour and gallantry, that the Turks could never &s;ecure to them&s;elves one palm of Land within their Territories, until the civil and mo&s;t dete&s;table Di&s;cords of that Country laid them open to the fury of their Enemies, who embraced this mo&s;t grateful op|portunity, which facilitated their De&s;ign, and made that ea&s;ie which they had &s;o long de&s;ired, and with care &s;tudied and contrived. But for the better under&s;tanding of the&s;e Affairs it is convenient for us to take the Thread of Hi&s;tory at &s;ome di&s;tance off, that &s;o we may with better light comprehend the Cau&s;es, O|riginal, and Occa&s;ions of this War.</P>
<P>The hatred and jealou&s;ies which the Otto|man Port hath always nouri&s;hed and con&s;erved again&s;t the Kingdom and Dominions of <HI>Po|land,</HI> are ancient and inveterate, having their ri&s;e from the valiant oppo&s;ition and &s;ucce&s;sful repul&s;es it always made again&s;t the various attempts of the Turks; whereby the Poles were animated to treat always at equals with them, and with terms agreeable to that vain glory and &s;welling pride, which are natural to their Nation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cau&s;es of the War with <HI>Po|land.</HI></NOTE> But that which renewed the memory of pa&s;t actions, and rai&s;ed an expectation in the Turks to avenge the injuries by &s;ubjugating the Co&s;acks, was one <HI>Bogdan Chimilniczki</HI> Ge|neral of the Co&s;acks, who growing powerful in that Country, with the &s;trength of a nume|rous Army, abhorring the Pride of the Poli&s;h Nobility, denied obedience to their Kingdom, re&s;olving to make him&s;elf the ab&s;olute Prince of that Province, from whence various fortunes of War &s;ucceeding, he was at length forced to join him&s;elf to the Tartars, and crave the pro|tection of the Turki&s;h Arms. In the mean time, <HI>Poland,</HI> invaded by the Swedes, Mo&s;co|vites, and Tran&s;ilvanians, was di&s;membred of <HI>Livonia,</HI> and a great part of <HI>Lituania</HI> and <HI>Verania,</HI> the fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Swedes, and the latter by the Czar of <HI>Mo&s;covy,</HI> and the Rebel Co&s;acks; which confu&s;ions rejoyced the Turks, and gave them the fir&s;t hopes, not only to free them&s;elves from the frequent Piracies the Co&s;acks committed on them in the Black Sea, but to impo&s;e upon them the Ottoman Yoke; to which end they maintained a &s;ecret corre&s;pondence with the Generals of that peo|ple, promi&s;ing them the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Men, Mony, and Arms, but yet with that caution, that they would not &s;eem unprovoked to quarrel with the Poles, or without ju&s;t cau&s;e to violate the peace of <HI>Choccin,</HI> to which they pretended a mo&s;t religious and reverend regard.</P>
<P>Wherefore, that they might not appear cau&s;ele&s;s Actors again&s;t that &s;olemn League, they &s;ecretly encouraged tho&s;e Incur&s;ions, which in the Years 1666 and 1667 we have already mentioned to have been made by the Tartars into <HI>Poland,</HI> as far as the Walls of <HI>Leopolis;</HI> which action, that the Tartars might not have occa&s;ion to abett and maintain, the Poles re&s;olved to &s;end a mo&s;t &s;plendid Emba&s;&s;y to the Turks, de&s;iring that the Tartar <HI>Han</HI> might be depo&s;ed, for having unju&s;tly violated the &s;acred peace of <HI>Choccin.</HI> For that as the Poles were obliged to re&s;train the Piracies and De|predations of the Co&s;acks in the Black Sea, &s;o the Turks were become &s;ecurity again&s;t the incur&s;ions of the Tartars. Scarce had the Am|ba&s;&s;ador <HI>Radiowski</HI> delivered this me&s;&s;age, be|fore he unhappily died at <HI>Adrianople</HI> (as we have before &s;ignified;) to who&s;e Complaint and Demand, after many delays, no other an&s;wer was given, than that the Poles &s;hould fir&s;t break their League which they had con|tracted with <HI>Mo&s;covy</HI> for thirteen years, without the con&s;ent, and again&s;t the plea&s;ure of the Port, and then after that they might expect and promi&s;e them&s;elves all due &s;atis|faction.</P>
<P>In this manner Affairs &s;tood when King <HI>Ca&s;imir,</HI> weary of the Factions and Di&s;cords of the Nobility, re&s;igned up his Crown to retire unto a private life. And now it being nece&s;&s;ary to proceed to a new Election we may con&s;equently expect various Commotions and Di&s;turbances in this State, &s;ufficient to artract the eyes of the Turks, and encourage the Co&s;acks in their intended Revolt. At length Prince <HI>Michael Korebut Wi&s;nowieski</HI> being elected King, it &s;eemed agreeable to rea&s;on, that all <HI>Verania</HI> &s;hould have returned to obedience of
<PB N="232" REF="118">him, to whom the be&s;t part of that Country did by right of patrimony, and natural inheri|tance belong; but the &s;ucce&s;s thereof fell out contrary to all expectation, for <HI>Doro&s;ensko,</HI> then General, de&s;igning to u&s;urp that Govern|ment, propo&s;ed the project of uniting <HI>Verania</HI> to the Body of <HI>Poland,</HI> as a member of the Crown, by which means that Province would not only become free from its Va&s;&s;alage to the Nobility, but obtain equal &s;uffrages in the Diet, with all the other more free and priviledged Countries; and in this manner he might not only compel <HI>Poland</HI> to conde&s;cend to his de&s;igns, but confirm him&s;elf in the ab|&s;olute and &s;upreme Authority of the Co&s;acks: This propo&s;ition therefore &s;eemed &s;o in&s;olent, and favouring of Rebellion to the Poli&s;h Court, that a &s;evere and menacing Me&s;&s;age was di&s;patched to <HI>Doro&s;ensko,</HI> threatning to take from him his Bulaua, or Truncheon of General, if ever he entertained any &s;uch ima|gination &s;o highly derogatory to the Maje&s;ty of the Poli&s;h State; he therefore thought it his time to ca&s;t him&s;elf wholly into the Pro|tection of the Sultan, and accordingly di&s;patch'd Amba&s;&s;adors to the Port to &s;ignifie their &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion, begging to be received into the Arms of the Ottoman Power; and as an a&s;&s;urance thereof, that he might receive the (Tough) which is the En&s;ign of Authority, carried by Pa&s;haws. The Vizier at the fir&s;t motion hereof, reflecting on the evil con&s;equences, in ca&s;e the Grand Signior's honour &s;hould be foiled in this action, &s;u&s;pended a while a com|pleat an&s;wer thereunto; but at length being in&s;tantly &s;ollicited, and perceiving the Di&s;|orders and Factions of <HI>Poland</HI> to encrea&s;e, the Co&s;acks were received for Subjects of the Empire, and obliged to wage War again&s;t all Enemies to the Ottoman Power.</P>
<P>Duke <HI>Michael</HI> being elected King, the fir&s;t Act he performed was to &s;end an Amba&s;&s;ador extraordinary to the Grand Signior, with no other De&s;ign than to acquaint him of his Electi|on to the Crown, only in ca&s;e an opportunity pre&s;ented, then to move for a ratification of the Articles concluded at <HI>Choccin.</HI> This Am|ba&s;&s;ador, called <HI>Wi&s;ozki,</HI> being of a haughty and proud &s;pirit, became the Author of all the mi&s;chief which en&s;ued; for being of a temper which could not equally bear the honour of his important Office, lanched out into matters beyond his Commi&s;&s;ion, and in|&s;tead of imparting his Me&s;&s;age, would become &s;ole Arbitrator of all the differences between tho&s;e two powerful Princes; for he being unac|quainted with the Power or Affairs of the Turks, &s;uppo&s;ed nothing in this World com|parable to the number, riches, and valour of his own Nation, and therefore gave him&s;elf that liberty of arrogant Language, that by way of Command and Menaces he rather &s;eemed to act the part of a Governor or Um|pire in the differences of State, than of an Orator or Suppliant for peace. In his conceit the Turks wanted both courage and power to invade <HI>Poland,</HI> and therefore &s;uppo&s;ed he might &s;afely brave them into a ratification of former Articles, e&s;pecially when he mentioned a hundred thou&s;and Hor&s;e, which he under|took before the Vizier to be able on his own account to conduct as far as the Walls of <HI>Adrianople.</HI> It was a &s;trange humor of <HI>Rodo|montado</HI> that in&s;pired the&s;e two la&s;t Amba&s;&s;a|dors, and if from them we may take a pattern of the di&s;po&s;ition of the re&s;t of the Poli&s;h No|bility, it will be no wonder to hear and read the De&s;tractions that are among&s;t them, that they carry them&s;elves with di&s;re&s;pect to their Prince, are emulous and factious among&s;t them&s;elves, and that their pride and ignorance, which have flattered their humour, and triumphed amid&s;t their Tenants and Va&s;&s;als, &s;hould betray them to all tho&s;e evils which we may fear may be the con&s;equences there|of.</P>
<P>The Great Vizier, con&s;idering the confi|dence which this per&s;on u&s;ed in his Di&s;cour&s;e, imagined that the differences in his Country might be compo&s;ed, and therefore in com|pliance with his de&s;ire, offered in general terms to confirm the peace made at <HI>Choccin,</HI> without Addition of any new Article in reference to the Co&s;acks, being a bu&s;ine&s;s of that nature which admitted of no pre&s;ent determination; this, he &s;aid, was his ultimate re&s;olution, which if the Amba&s;&s;adour approved not, he might then advi&s;e it home, and expect a farther re&s;ult of their Coun&s;els. <HI>Wi&s;ozki</HI> being really po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in his fancy of the Turks weakne&s;s, gave way to his pa&s;&s;ion, and with little judgment replied, That he approved not of the Propo&s;ition, nor needed he to tran&s;mit any &s;uch advice into <HI>Po|land,</HI> he him&s;elf being a Plenipotentiary of as full a Power as the King and Council; for be|ing a Nobleman, he was by con&s;equence that nece&s;&s;ary Member of the Republick, that nothing could pa&s;s without his Suffrage.</P>
<P>The Vizier amazed at this extravagant way of di&s;cour&s;e, the which he &s;upported with moderation and contempt, di&s;patched away a Chiaus into <HI>Poland</HI> with Letters, de&s;iring that this Amba&s;&s;adour &s;hould be recalled, as being a Per&s;on unable to manage matters of the lea&s;t concernment; and if they &s;upplied his place with an other, he &s;hould be received with due re&s;pect, and a plain way laid open to con|clude his Negotiations to the &s;atisfaction of both Parties.</P>
<P><HI>Wi&s;ozki</HI> abounding in his own &s;en&s;e and humor, repre&s;ented matters in a far different manner into <HI>Poland,</HI> alledging, That the Law of Nations was impeached by the violence offer|ed to his Per&s;on, being impri&s;oned, and the u&s;ual Tain or Allowance of Amba&s;&s;adours withheld from him; both which were not ab&s;o|lutely true: for the maintenance he refu&s;ed as too mean for his Quality and Office; and for his Impri&s;onment, it was no other than Con|finement to the City of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> with a prohibition only from pa&s;&s;ing over unto <HI>Pera,</HI> where formerly in a hou&s;e he had taken, he committed a thou&s;and irregularities and di&s;or|ders, which cau&s;ed the Vizier to recal him a|gain over to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> denying him the liberty of pa&s;&s;ing more to the other &s;ide. The&s;e were the injuries which he complained of into <HI>Poland,</HI> &s;till fancying, That if the Nobility were a&s;&s;embled to con&s;ider of the&s;e matters, the Turk would be &s;o affrighted at it as to conde|&s;cend unto any terms he &s;hould propound. The&s;e reports of <HI>Wi&s;ozki</HI> took that impre&s;&s;ion with the Court, that e&s;teeming all authentick which he &s;aid or wrote, without farther exami|nation i&s;&s;ued out Orders for a general In&s;urrecti|on, and that all people &s;hould prepare for the War, rendring the Vizier no other an&s;wer, than that when their Amba&s;&s;adour was &s;et at liberty,
<PB N="233" REF="118">and had licence to depart, the like &s;hould be permitted unto theirs, and in the mean time the Chiaus was committed to &s;afe cu&s;tody, The Grand Signior highly angred at this ob&s;tinate mi&s;under&s;tanding, immediately ordered that <HI>Wi&s;ozki</HI> &s;hould depart, and at the &s;ame time commanded his whole Militia to ri&s;e and fol|low him to the War; and &s;o much the rather was he animated by the reports &s;ent him from <HI>Doro&s;enzko,</HI> &s;econded by the Vayvods of <HI>Mol|davia</HI> and <HI>Valachia,</HI> who&s;e Letters declared the mi&s;erable confu&s;ions in <HI>Poland</HI> divided into divers Factions and Parties, their want of money, and the mutiny of the Souldiery inclined rather to betray than defend <HI>Verania.</HI> And now a Sword and other Pre&s;ents u&s;ual in the&s;e ca&s;es, being &s;ent to the Tartar <HI>Han,</HI> he was ordered to unite with the Co&s;&s;acks, and to invade <HI>Poland,</HI> where being encountred near <HI>Batona,</HI> by a Bo|dy of Hor&s;e under the Command of <HI>Luzecki</HI> Governour of <HI>Podolia,</HI> the Poles were defeated, and was the fir&s;t bad Omen of the ill &s;ucce&s;s of this unhappy War.</P>
<P>To &s;econd the&s;e beginnings, the Grand Sig|nior having rai&s;ed an Army of an hundred and fifty thou&s;and men, marched towards <HI>Po|land</HI> already &s;ick and langui&s;hing with its own inte&s;tine di&s;tempers, and unable to contend with a Body united within it &s;elf, wanting nei|ther internal vigour, nor nouri&s;hment to main|tain its &s;trength; the fir&s;t Enterpri&s;e was the impregnable Fortre&s;s of <HI>Caminiecz,</HI> which had often in former times baffled the Ottoman Arms; but now being ill provided, de&s;titute of Arms, Ammunition, Provi&s;ions, and but weakly manned, and what was wor&s;t, de&s;pair|ing of any Relief, after eleven days Siege &s;ur|rendred it &s;elf to the plea&s;ure of the Conque|rour. Hence the Turks had an open pa&s;&s;age through all <HI>Podolia</HI> and <HI>Volhinia</HI> to the very Walls of <HI>Leopolis,</HI> which they pa&s;&s;ed over like Travellers rather than Enemies, there not ap|pearing one per&s;on in Arms to oppo&s;e them, delighting and &s;porting them&s;elves in the&s;e mo&s;t fruitful and delicious Countries of <HI>Europe:</HI> thus had private animo&s;ities and civil rancour po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed the minds of the Poles one agaisn&s;t the o|ther, that they had rather yield them&s;elves to the &s;ervitude of an Enemy, than conde&s;cend to the humor or coun&s;el of a Citizen. Thus had the Turks pa&s;&s;ed all this Summer in the Plains and Cities of <HI>Poland,</HI> where it &s;eemed rather Peace than War, all places &s;ubmitting with|out difficulty unto the Grand Signior as to their true and natural Lord and Soveragin, by which means the Inhabitants redeemed their Lives and E&s;tates; for the Sultan willing to demon&s;trate his clemency, and to &s;pare tho&s;e who volun|tarily yielded, and encourage others to &s;ubmit to &s;o gentle a yoke, forbad all the common out|rages of Souldiers, not permitting Plunder or Booty to be brought into the Camp; nor grea|ter Spoils to be committed, than if his Army had pa&s;&s;ed through his own Dominions; whether this obliging or winning manner of proceedings overcame the &s;tout hearts of the Polanders more than blows, will be experienced in the &s;equel of this &s;tory; it is certain the Mili|tia returned home poor and weary, and more broken by this years Expedition than by the long and tedious March to <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and hazar|dous Battles during the Siege of <HI>Babylon;</HI> but the Sultan was de&s;irous to return home, and give this fir&s;t proof and te&s;timony to the World of his war-like and invincible Spirit, of his clemency and of his &s;ucce&s;s in Arms, that at his fir&s;t appearing in the Field, all Armies and Fortre&s;&s;es &s;ubmitted to his Power. The Poles on the other &s;ide being of an opinion and temper far different to that of their Amba&s;adour <HI>Wi&s;ozki,</HI> re&s;olved to purcha&s;e the departure of their new Gue&s;ts on any terms; &s;o that the&s;e following Articles were agreed and conclud|ed.</P>
<P>That the King of <HI>Poland</HI> &s;hould quit all Claim to <HI>&V;krain, Podolia,</HI> and <HI>Ru&s;land.</HI></P>
<P>That for <HI>Leopolis</HI> and the Country thereabouts &s;hould be paid a Tribute of &s;eventy thou&s;and Dollars a year; all other Capitulations for|merly made were to &s;tand in force and vir|tue.</P>
<P>The&s;e Articles being &s;igned, the Grand Sig|nior committed the Government of <HI>Verama</HI> and <HI>Podolia</HI> to <HI>Doro&s;enzko,</HI> and the defence of <HI>Caminiecz</HI> to <HI>Chu&s;aein</HI> Pa&s;ha with a Garri&s;on of twelve thou&s;and Jani&s;aries; &s;o that now being returned home, the Militia was permitted to repair to their &s;everal Countries and Dwellings, the following year being dedicated to the repo&s;e and ea&s;e of the Souldiery.</P>
<P>Towards the end of this Year, when the Ships of <HI>Barbary</HI> returned home, tho&s;e of <HI>Tripoli</HI> con|ceived a certain di&s;content again&s;t their Pa&s;ha named <HI>O&s;man</HI> for his covetous behaviour to|wards his Souldiers; for having that Summer taken very rich Prizes from the Venetians and other Nations, the Souldiers expected at their return home to receive a divi&s;ion of their Spoils according to their ju&s;t and equal &s;hares. But the Pa&s;ha grown old and covetous, getting the whole into his hand, appropriated the greate&s;t part to his own Coffers, di&s;tributing to the Soul|diers an incon&s;iderable proportion of what they had gained the year before. Hereupon the chiefe&s;t Commanders among&s;t them becoming greatly enraged began to incen&s;e the Souldiery, which for intere&s;t or want of Pay, being always ready to mutiny, took fire immediately, and ea&s;ily were blown into a Rebellion; &s;o that fir&s;t making Parties, and retiring into &s;ecret Junto's and Councils, they re&s;olved to de&s;troy the Pa&s;ha, and alter the Government, and thereby make them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of all the Trea&s;ure and Riches which <HI>O&s;man</HI> Pa&s;ha had in the &s;pace of thirty years ama&s;&s;ed together. The Pa&s;ha having notice of all that pa&s;&s;ed, and apprehending the Con&s;piracies of this unbridled People to be dangerous, began to provide for his &s;afety, and getting together &s;o many as he &s;uppo&s;ed of his Party, and that were, or might be faithful to him, which joyned with his Slaves and Servants, made up a &s;mall Gar|ri&s;on, wherewith to defend and pre&s;erve him|&s;elf within his Ca&s;tle, which being well provid|ed of Ammunition and Victuals, he &s;hut his Gates, denying acce&s;s or admittance unto all per&s;ons upon pretence and account what&s;oever. Hereupon the Mutiny appearing, the Souldiery drew into a Body in the open field, again&s;t whom &s;everal &s;hot were made from the Ca&s;tle; &s;o that now the Civil War was begun, and the whole Force of <HI>Tripoli</HI> rai&s;ed again&s;t the Pa&s;ha and his Ca&s;tle, which being &s;traitly be|&s;ieged the Defendants who were for the mo&s;t part Servants and Slaves, failing in their cou|rage, re&s;olved to make Conditions for them|&s;elves to the be&s;t advantage; wherefore con&s;pi|ring again&s;t their Ma&s;ter, entred his Chamber
<PB N="234" REF="119">and &s;trangled him in the night; and the next morning opening the Ca&s;tle-gates, received the Enemy within the Walls, making manife&s;t the death of their Ma&s;ter and their own Treachery. <HI>O&s;man</HI> Pa&s;ha being dead, every one acted for a time what the wildne&s;s of an unruly multitude could &s;ugge&s;t, till &s;uch time as the Heads of the Rebellion could frame them&s;elves into &s;ome form of Government, which for the pre&s;ent was re&s;olved to be by a <HI>Dei,</HI> as mo&s;t conve|nient for commanding of the Souldiery, in|tending for the future to take the <HI>Algier</HI> Govern|ment by a Divan for their Pattern and Model of Rule, under which the people of that place had found and experienced the &s;weetne&s;s of li|berty, riches, and &s;ucce&s;s. The&s;e matters be|ing agreed upon, &s;ome of their Men of War were &s;ent to give advice unto the Grand Signior of the revolutions of their City, &s;upplicating him to pardon the violence u&s;ed again&s;t their Pa&s;ha <HI>O&s;man,</HI> who&s;e Covetou&s;ne&s;s and Tyranny forced them for &s;elf-pre&s;ervation to precipitate that Authority, which they knew on their com|plaints, his Maje&s;ty would have granted them; and that he would be plea&s;ed to receive them into his protection and favour, as his faithful and humble Subjects and Slaves, and as an evi|dence thereof would grant them a Pa&s;ha confirm|ed by his Royal Signature. The Sultan, though at fir&s;t &s;hewed him&s;elf much di&s;plea&s;ed with this manner of proceeding again&s;t <HI>O&s;man</HI> Pa&s;ha; yet &s;eeing that there was no remedy, &s;uffered him&s;elf to be mollified by their Pre&s;ents and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, granting them a Pa&s;ha for their Governour, who&s;e power proved as un&s;ignifi|cant as his doth, who bears that Title at <HI>Algier.</HI> Matters being thus reduced to &s;ome tolerable condition among&s;t them, they concluded, That the mo&s;t beneficial cour&s;e of life to render them con&s;iderable, as well as to amu&s;e and divert the minds of their rude people from innovati|ons again&s;t their Governours, was to grant free liberty to whom&s;oever plea&s;ed to arm out Ships of War; which Priviledge <HI>O&s;man</HI> Pa&s;ha re&s;er|ved to him&s;elf and his Confidents; and finding at pre&s;ent that they were able to &s;et out &s;ix Sail from forty to fifty Guns, and four more from twelve to thirty, intending to accompli&s;h in all the full number of fifteen Sail; tho&s;e who trad|ed in the Levant Seas began to apprehend, that this faithle&s;s and heady people would at a time, when they found their advantage and the temp|tation of a rich Prize, break their Peace with his Maje&s;ty our King, the which <HI>O&s;man</HI> Pa&s;ha had notwith&s;tanding con&s;erved for &s;everal years without violation, moved perhaps thereunto out of an apprehen&s;ion, that in &s;uch troubles which a War with <HI>England</HI> might bring upon them, he might lo&s;e or impair his riches, and bring the like confu&s;ion on his people, as he had late|ly heard of in <HI>Algier</HI> on the like occa&s;ion: but how and in what manner the&s;e matters &s;ucceed|ed, and how at length this people broke their Peace and Faith, we re&s;erve to be recounted at the end of the Year 1674.</P>
<P>Towards the end of the month of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> it plea&s;ed God to take out of this life unto a better Sir <HI>Daniel Harvey</HI> his Maje&s;ties Amba&s;&s;adour at <HI>Con&s;tantinople:</HI> a man who&s;e per&s;on being comely, was extremely grateful to the Turks; and for the experience he had at the Ottoman Court, was equal in the happy management of Affairs to any of his Predece&s;&s;ours.</P>

<P>BUT it &s;eems the Turks had made too much ha&s;te in their return to dige&s;t a Conque&s;t of &s;o large Extent; &s;o that they were &s;carce well warmed by their Winter-fires, before they were alarmed again with Jea|lou&s;ies of <HI>Poland,</HI> and the Seditions among&s;t the Co&s;&s;acks, whom <HI>Doro&s;enzko</HI> wrote he could not keep in &s;ubjection, unle&s;s he had &s;ome Suc|cours &s;ent him from the Port. The rumors likewi&s;e that the Mu&s;covite armed, and was re&s;olved to A&s;&s;i&s;t the Poles in recovery of their lo&s;t Country, increa&s;ed the apprehen&s;ions of the Turks, who too late perceived the errour they had committed in &s;o &s;oon disbanding their Ar|my, which before &s;ome were &s;carce got home, they were forced to recal. But now the year was well begun, and no grand preparations made; &s;o that it was impo&s;&s;ible to collect an Army in &s;o &s;hort a time con&s;iderable enough to be honoured with the Conduct of the Sul|tan; wherefore it was re&s;olved, that all things this year &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed in a readine&s;s again&s;t the next. But the Grand Signior had a project of his own to depart &s;peedily with his Court, and to pa&s;s the heats of the Summer in the Moun|tains of <HI>Zegna</HI> about five or &s;ix days Journey on his way towards <HI>Poland,</HI> which being reported to be a place well planted with Trees, watered with cool and fre&s;h Springs, and abounding with all &s;orts of Game, made him impatient to take up his Summer-quarters in a Country &s;o agree|able to his humor; and that he might cover the de&s;ign of plea&s;ure with that of profit and policy, he pretended that the report of his pro|ceeding &s;o far would both ha&s;ten the Army, and give a terrour to the Enemy. But the Great Vi|zier and his Council who weighed all things bet|ter, were of another opinion, judging it neither honourable for the Court to be retired into Woods and Mountains, nor the advantage of &s;uch a &s;urmi&s;e able to countervail the expence and inconveniences of that Journy; and there|fore it was concluded to &s;tand unto the fir&s;t re|&s;olution, That the Grand Signior with the main Body of his Army &s;hould not move until the following year, but that in this interim all pre|parations &s;hould be made for Provi&s;ions and Ammunition, in order unto which three thou|&s;and Jani&s;aries were already &s;ent away to <HI>Kemi|niecz</HI> under the Command of the <HI>Samp&s;ongi|ba&s;hee</HI> and &s;ix thou&s;and more under the <HI>Zagar|giba&s;hee</HI> were to be landed on that <HI>I&s;thumus,</HI> which joyns the <HI>Crim</HI> Tartar unto the Main, from whence they had a &s;hort March to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Dorh&s;enzko. Cha&s;aein</HI> Pa&s;ha lately come from <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> was nominated for General to be &s;ent into <HI>Sili&s;tria,</HI> and there to command in Chief over the Militia of <HI>Dobriza, Bo&s;na,</HI> and <HI>Rumelia</HI> in ca&s;e of any alteration and di&s;turbance in <HI>Poland:</HI> this Per&s;on was al|ways accounted a &s;tout and valiant Souldier, though &s;eldom fortunate, and was the &s;ame that lo&s;t the Battel before <HI>Lewa</HI> in the la&s;t German Wars, as we have before intimated: he was about this time grown infirm by a hepatical Dy&s;entery, which reduced him to a weak condition of body, with little hopes of reco|very.</P>
<P>In the mean time arrived at <HI>Adrianople</HI> an Amba&s;&s;adour from the great Czar of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI>
<PB N="235" REF="119">bringing Letters dated in <HI>April</HI> of the preceding year, which was before the time that the Turks had entred <HI>Poland,</HI> the contents of which were, That the Grand Signior would do well to de&s;i&s;t from his de&s;ign again&s;t that Country;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The un&s;ea|&s;onable Ad|dre&s;s of the Mo&s;co|vite Am|ba&s;&s;adour.</NOTE> for that if he did proceed and invade tho&s;e Dominions, he &s;hould find him&s;elf obliged to make War upon him, and with his mighty and pui&s;&s;ant Power to drive him back to his own Juri&s;diction. This Me&s;&s;age appeared very un&s;ea&s;onable, and cau&s;ed much laughter at fir&s;t; for that the Turk had &s;ince the Date of that Letter invaded <HI>Po|land,</HI> and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of va&s;t Countries, and yet neither encountred any oppo&s;ition from the Mu&s;covite, nor &s;o much as heard any ru|mor of his Motion. Wherefore the Turks with &s;corn forbad the Amba&s;&s;adour any far|ther Addre&s;&s;es, and commanded him to be gone &s;peedily, &s;aying, That his Ma&s;ter had neither courage nor force to maintain his word of War, nor wi&s;dom to manage a Treaty of Peace.</P>
<P>The Reports now from the parts of <HI>Poland</HI> &s;pake matters to be in a quiet po&s;ture, and not likely to concern the Turks much for this year; wherefore the Grand Signior began again to renew his purpo&s;es of pa&s;time and plea&s;ure in the Mountains of <HI>Zegna;</HI> but becau&s;e no true or perfect account could be given of the de|lights, refre&s;hments, and &s;ituation of that place, the <HI>Olack Celebi</HI> or chief Po&s;tma&s;ter was &s;ent to furvey the Country, and to return with a rela|tion of all matters: but in the interim the de&s;ign was altered; for the Grand Signior having be|gun a Fabrick in which he had expended about eighty thou&s;and Dollars, at a &s;mall Village about nine or ten miles from <HI>Adrianople;</HI> the place and novelty of the Building &s;o well plea&s;ed him, that he found in him&s;elf an inclination to pa&s;s the whole Summer there; and becoming likewi&s;e enamoured of a young Lady in his Seraglio, notwith&s;tanding his former tenderne&s;s to his Queen, and late aver&s;ion to all other Women, he judged it was po&s;&s;ible to diverti&s;e his time well in tho&s;e parts, and more to his contentment, than in wild woods and uninha|bited mountains. Whereupon the intentions of <HI>Zegna</HI> were laid a&s;ide, and nothing thought of but the re&s;t and quietne&s;s of the Court for this year.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e it was reported, That the Czar of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> made great Preparations for War, it was judged nece&s;&s;ary to command the <HI>Crim</HI> Tartar to be watchful of his motion by Land, though the natural &s;lothfulne&s;s of that people gave them no apprehen&s;ion of their Arms for this year; how&s;oever it being probable, that they might prove more active and forward in the Black Sea, than they were capable to do by Land, by &s;ending forth their &s;mall Boats down the <HI>Volga</HI> to take and pillage the Saiks and Ve&s;|&s;els belonging to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> and other parts; the Captain-Pa&s;ha was ordered to pa&s;s into that Sea with thirty five or forty Sail of Gallies for de|fence of the Coa&s;t, and for fortifying and repair|ing <HI>A&s;ac,</HI> and the Fortre&s;&s;es thereabouts but whil&s;t the&s;e Preparations were making for the Euxine or Black Sea, the other Seas were neg|lected and undefended; for the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Fleet con&s;i&s;ting in all of eight Sail,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Alex|andrian</HI> Fleet taken by the Malte&s;es.</NOTE> were encoun|tred not far from <HI>Rhodes</HI> by &s;ome Malte&s;e and Ligorne&s;e Cor&s;aires: the Ships of the Turks were mo&s;t of them very great and potent Ships, one of them was at lea&s;t fifteen hundred Tuns, and was capable to carry an hundred Guns, the others of eight hundred or a thou|&s;and Tuns, able to have re&s;i&s;ted and overcome, had they been well armed, double the force that a&s;&s;aulted them; but being now engaged with an Enemy, though not &s;o &s;trong, yet better ex|perienced in marine Affairs than them&s;elves, they fought with them &s;toutly the fir&s;t day; but the next day &s;ix Gallies coming to the Chri&s;tians a&s;&s;i&s;tance, (which had been harbour|ed in &s;ome Port not far di&s;tant, and led thither by the noi&s;e of the Cannon, to which al&s;o a calm giving the greater advantage) the Turks began to faint in their courage, &s;o that four Gallions and two Saiks yielded to mercy, which was a Prize of &s;o great value, that it was &s;up|po&s;ed never to have been equalled &s;ince the time of Sultan <HI>Ibrahim,</HI> when the lo&s;s of the grand Sultana and other Ships gave the fir&s;t occa&s;ion of War with <HI>Venice.</HI> This great Ship which was reported by tho&s;e who &s;aw her to be both longer and broader than the Soveraign, carried only &s;ixty Guns, and was manned ac|cordingly only with about an hundred Seamen, and about two hundred more which were Land|men, wholly unacquainted with the Sea or with Naval Fights: the bigge&s;t Ship among&s;t the re&s;t was belonging to the Queen-Mother, and the others to the Grand Signior, being freighted principally with Sugar, Coffee, Rice, and o|ther Provi&s;ions for the proper maintenance of their Courts, which we may &s;uppo&s;e will high|ly inflame the&s;e grand Per&s;onages, with anger and di&s;dain, when they reflect on their own proper lo&s;&s;es which touch them &s;o nearly as their peculiar Goods and the Furniture of their Kitchins.</P>
<P>The Turki&s;h Court now angered with this lo&s;s, was more moved in the mid&s;t of <HI>May,</HI> when a Me&s;&s;enger from <HI>Poland</HI> arrived with Letters from the Grand Chancellour, declaring with mode&s;t-terms,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Poles refu&s;e to pay their promi&s;ed Tribute.</NOTE> That their Kingdom was unable or unwilling for many re&s;pects to pay the promi&s;ed Tribute; &s;o that if they did not judge fit to wave or lay a&s;ide tho&s;e preten&s;ions, they &s;hould be forced to take up Arms in defence of their Honour, Safety, and Priviledge of their Dominions. The Turks &s;urpri&s;ed with this un|expected Me&s;&s;age, too late perceived the errour of the la&s;t years proceedings, which were car|ried on with a clemency and confidence not agreeable to the di&s;po&s;ition and humor of &s;uch an Enemy, as is unacquainred with &s;ervitude, and &s;o far from being able to &s;upport a Foreign Yoke, that they cannot endure &s;ubjection to their own Civil Government, every Nobleman (of which there are many in <HI>Poland</HI>) being am|bitious to be a Prince, judges him&s;elf better than his elected King. Hence proceeded all tho&s;e di&s;|&s;entions which laid them open to the late inva|&s;ion of their powerful Enemy, the apprehen&s;ion of whom having obducted for a while tho&s;e &s;ores of Faction which fe&s;tered among&s;t them, and that principle of &s;elf-con&s;ervation, which by a forcible nature inclined them to Union, at length armed them with a re&s;olution to avenge the Liberties of their Country, and a&s;&s;ured them of the Truth of that Saying, That <HI>a Kingdom divided again&s;t it &s;elf cannot &s;tand.</HI></P>
<P>The Turks now wi&s;hed that they had either made a true u&s;e of their Victory, and the op|portune
<PB N="236" REF="120">Conjuncture of the la&s;t years Affairs to have &s;etled and &s;ecured their Conque&s;ts, or that they had never begun the War; for now find|ing them&s;elves engaged in it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Rebels in <HI>Hun|gary</HI> re|new their Petition to the Turks for a&s;&s;i|&s;tance.</NOTE> they were in ho|nour obliged to proceed, and lo&s;e the fair oppor|tunity which pre&s;ented to make their advantage in <HI>Hungary;</HI> to which place they had been, and were &s;till invited by the Rebles of that Country, who to revenge the Cau&s;e of <HI>Serini, Nada&s;ti,</HI> and &s;ome other Di&s;contents and Aggrievances of which they complained, and to defend the Prote&s;tant Religion, in which by the zeal of &s;ome Churchmen, they were di&s;turbed, re&s;olved to abandon their Allegiance to their natural Prince, and rather &s;eek a protection for their E&s;tates, and allowance for their Religion un|der the Turks, than remain beholding for either to a prevailing party at the Imperial Court. The chief Authours of this Rebellion were <HI>Petrozy, Sepe&s;i, Tende, Gabor, Sutrey,</HI> and other principal per&s;ons among&s;t the Hungarians, who having on their own &s;trength oppo&s;ed them|&s;elves again&s;t the Emperour the la&s;t year were defeated in divers engagements, and at length reduced to a very low and mi&s;erable condition.

<P>The Turks though well &s;atisfied of the rea|&s;onablene&s;s of the de&s;ign, yet being engaged in honour again&s;t <HI>Poland,</HI> knew not how to retract, and therefore di&s;patched away the Me&s;&s;engers for the pre&s;ent with fair hopes and &s;ecret pro|mi&s;es, well treated in private, though they received rather a Denial than Encouragement in publick. For the expedition again&s;t <HI>Poland</HI> was that which employed &s;olely the wi&s;e&s;t heads of the Empire, who as it were in fury i&s;&s;ued out immediate Orders,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The rage of the Turks a|gain&s;t <HI>Poland.</HI></NOTE> That all tho&s;e who eat the Grand Signior's Bread, &s;hould without farther delay prepare them&s;elves for the Wars again&s;t <HI>Poland;</HI> and that Provi&s;ions and Ammuniti|on &s;hould be &s;upplyed in all places according to the u&s;ual proportions; The Tugh, or Hor&s;e-Tail, (the Signal for departure) was &s;et forth, the Tents ordered to be carried into the Field, and &s;uch ha&s;te made in all parts, as if the rai&s;ing of an Army were the bu&s;ine&s;s, but of one day; re&s;olving immediately to proceed again&s;t their Enemies, to whom the Sultan returned a mo&s;t dreadful and menacing Letter, full of expre&s;|&s;ions agreeable to the Turki&s;h Style, which threatned Confu&s;ion, Sword, Famine, Fire, De&s;truction, and a thou&s;and other more direful Judgments: but the Collection of this great Army, and the appendages belonging there|unto, were not &s;o &s;uddenly provided as to ad|mit of &s;uch a di&s;patch as the Sultan's fury pre|tended; wherefore in cooler blood it was con|cluded, That for this Summer they &s;hould not pa&s;s much beyond the other &s;ide of the <HI>Danube,</HI> that the Winter Quarters &s;hould be de&s;igned in <HI>Sili&s;tria,</HI> from whence they might more effectu|ally threaten and affright their Enemies with their near approach.</P>
<P>About this time the French found an oppor|tune &s;ea&s;on to accommodate all their Affairs with the Port, and to put a period to the &s;everal Articles and particulars they had for many years demanded.

<P>But to return again to the de&s;igns again&s;t <HI>Poland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Turks re&s;olve on a war a|gain&s;t <HI>Po|land.</HI></NOTE> the Sultan about the end of <HI>July</HI> marched with &s;uch Forces as were then in a readine&s;s towards the Confines of that Country; and though he had not with him above fifteen thou&s;and men, yet it was concluded that the Fame and terror of the Grand Signior's mo|tion would either abate and bring low the &s;pirits of the Poles, and induce them to di&s;|patch an Amba&s;&s;ador with terms of Peace, or at lea&s;t this readine&s;s of the Turki&s;h Camp would be an early preparation for the de&s;igns of the next year, and put the whole Empire into a timely motion, and that uniting with the Forces of the Frontiers, they might make a Body &s;ufficient to re&s;i&s;t any &s;udden Incur&s;ion. This re&s;olution being taken, the Great Vizier led the Van, and encamped on the Banks of the <HI>Danube</HI> near a place called <HI>I&s;acgee,</HI> where he with all diligence built a Bridge of Boats to pa&s;s his Forces with the greate&s;t facility to the other &s;ide, on which lies the Country of <HI>Mol|davia.</HI> The Sultan about a days journey &s;hort of the Vizier, fixed his Court and Camp at a place called <HI>Babadog;</HI> with intention after &s;ome days to cro&s;s the River, and proceed as far as <HI>Kemenitz,</HI> that by the influence of his powerful Pre&s;ence he might encourage his Army there, and provide all things nece&s;&s;ary for &s;ecurity of that Garri&s;on. But in the mean time ad|vices coming that the Poli&s;h Army, con&s;i&s;ting of about twenty thou&s;and men, was roving about the Confines of <HI>Leopolis,</HI> under the Command of General <HI>Sobieski,</HI> and that a re|conciliation was pa&s;&s;ed between the King and him; and that <HI>Zircha,</HI> Commander of the Co&s;acks, joyned to con&s;iderable forces of the Mo&s;covite and Calmuck Tartars, had made incur&s;ions into the parts about <HI>O&s;ac,</HI> cau&s;ed the Sultan to de&s;i&s;t from his de&s;igned progre&s;s to <HI>Kemenitz,</HI> and to pa&s;s no farther than over the River into <HI>Moldavia</HI> for hunting or other pa&s;times. By the&s;e matters the Turks being fully convinced, that the Poles re&s;olved not to pay their promi&s;ed tribute, nor to &s;end an Am|ba&s;&s;ador with propo&s;itions, which were con|de&s;cending or &s;upplicating for Peace; the Sultan him&s;elf di&s;patched away an Aga with Letters into <HI>Poland</HI> full of threats, menaces, and pro|te&s;tations of bringing all that ruine, mi&s;ery, and de&s;truction on their Country, which always attends the mo&s;t cruel and bloudy War, if they did not retrieve their error by a &s;peedy

<P>But the Poles were &s;o much in earne&s;t, and &s;o little e&s;teemed the menaces of the Sultan, that they anticipated his threats by &s;ome acts of ho&s;tility, and &s;howed that they &s;o much &s;corned his anger that they were re&s;olved to be the fir&s;t Aggre&s;&s;ors.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Poles pa&s;s the <HI>Nei&s;ter.</HI></NOTE> For the great Mare&s;chal <HI>Sobieski</HI> with his Lieutenant General <HI>Wi&s;no|witzki</HI> marched forward, and boldly pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Nie&s;ter</HI> with fifty thou&s;and &s;elect Souldiers. The General of the Turki&s;h Army, <HI>Chu&s;aein</HI> Pa&s;ha, alarmed hereat, immediately i&s;&s;ued forth &s;uch Orders for preparing and fitting his Camp as were agreeable to a &s;peedy Battel; and that he might under&s;tand the &s;tate of his Camp, he called the Prince or Vayvord of <HI>Moldavia</HI> to examine him concerning the &s;tate and con|dition of his Forces; the an&s;wer he gave proving not &s;atisfactory to the expectation of the Turk, who was enraged at the approach of the Enemy, with high and proud words in|&s;ulted over the Prince, giving him no better terms than Dog and Infidel, and at length &s;truck him over the head with his Pole-Axe; notwith&s;tanding which, and the di&s;grace he put upon him, imprudently that night com|mitted unto him, and to the Prince of <HI>Valachia,</HI> the care of the Guards, which con&s;i&s;ted of three thou&s;and Men.

The Prince, that he might make a Vertue of Ne|ce&s;&s;ity, complained of no force or violence offered unto him by his Souldiers, but as if he had voluntarily revolted, &s;howed outwardly a fair and &s;erene countenance towards the Poles, until &s;uch time as with forty of his Men, he found an opportunity to e&s;cape; but being by next morning at break of day overtaken by five Troops of Polonian Hor&s;e, his whole Retinue was &s;lain by them, excepting five of his men, who with him&s;elf, &s;aved them&s;elves by the &s;wiftne&s;s of their Hor&s;es; How&s;oever, the Prince received a wound on his left hand with a Sword, with which pre&s;enting him&s;elf before the Great Vizier, and by that te&s;timony boa&s;ting of his Faith and Loyalty to the Otto|man Hou&s;e, was conducted by him to the pre|&s;ence of the Sultan, who, in reward of his fidelity and valour, ve&s;ted him with a rich Coftan, and re&s;tored him again to his Princi|pality with addition of three hundred A&s;pers a day pay. His Wife and Children which re|mained as Ho&s;tages at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> being upon the News of the Princes Revolt clapt into the &s;even Towers, were again relea&s;ed, and conducted to their hou&s;e with all imaginable honour and magnificence.</P>
<P>But the Moldavian Prince was more in earne&s;t, and heartily di&s;dained the affront of|fered him by <HI>Chu&s;aein</HI> Pa&s;ha, towards whom, and the other Turks, though he carried a &s;erene and calm coutenance, yet he nouri&s;hed a &s;ecret flame and &s;torm within him&s;elf; to vent which, and revenge the affront, he maintained a corre&s;pondence with <HI>Sobieski,</HI> giving him in|telligence of all matters in the Turki&s;h Camp,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince of <HI>Molda|via</HI> re|volts.</NOTE> how he might mo&s;t ea&s;ily &s;urprize the Forces of the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Sivas,</HI> and the four Generals of the Spahees of <HI>Alchabolick.</HI></P>
<P>The Chri&s;tians made u&s;e of this intelligence accordingly, by making their a&s;&s;ault on the Enemy on the weake&s;t &s;ide, when the Prince having re&s;erved his anger until an opportune Sea&s;on, turned his face again&s;t the Turks, and with a courage agreeable to his &s;pirit and com|mand, he entered the Tabor, or Intrenchment of <HI>Chu&s;aein</HI> Pa&s;ha, and wounded him with his own hand. The heat of the Fight continued fourteen hours, in which none behaved him&s;elf more valianlty than did <HI>Solyman</HI> Pa&s;ha the Beg|lerbeg of <HI>Bo&s;na,</HI> who though he was as brave and fought as &s;toutly as any man could having &s;ix Hor&s;es that day killed under him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Turks overthrow.</NOTE> he was at length forced to fly and abandon the field, following <HI>Chu&s;aein</HI> Pa&s;ha, of <HI>Sivas</HI> and <HI>Ciddi|ogla,</HI> who made better u&s;e, in &s;aving them|&s;elves, of their hor&s;es heels, than their own Arms; But in this Flight his Hor&s;e pitching his foot into the hole of a wooden Bridge, which he was to pa&s;s, was there &s;topped until he was overtaken by a Souldier with a Hat, who &s;hot him through the Body; &s;o that con|tinuing his flight more faintly than before, he was overtaken by a Palonian Hu&s;&s;ar, who with a Lance bore him to the Ground, where he was trod under foot, and cut in pieces by the Enemy: The other three Pa&s;haws were wounded; the Generals of the Green and Yellow Sangiacks of the Spahees were taken Pri&s;oners, and two other principal Comman|ders of the Spahees were killed. The Zagar|geeba&s;hee, who commanded eighteen Cham|bers of Jani&s;aries, was taken pri&s;oner, the Stan|dard of the Jani&s;aries taken, and they wholly cut in pieces and de&s;troyed, con&s;i&s;ting of eight thou&s;and five hundred men; all the Troops and Attendants of tho&s;e Pa&s;haws, with four Sangiacks of Spahees, were &s;lain upon the place, which in all were computed to be about twenty five thou&s;and men. The booty taken was very con&s;iderable, for be&s;ides the ordinary Baggage they took two thou&s;and pur&s;es of money, then newly brought for payment of the Souldiery, and twenty five thou|&s;and Waggons of Provi&s;ions and Ammuni|tion.</P>
<P>After this &s;ucce&s;s and important Victory the Poles became Ma&s;ters of the &s;trong Fortre&s;s of <HI>Chotin,</HI> and other &s;maller Palanchas, on the Banks of the <HI>Nie&s;ter,</HI> making their Incur&s;i|ons into <HI>Moldavia,</HI> as far as <HI>Ja&s;h,</HI> which is the principal City of that Country.

But <HI>Chu&s;aein</HI> Pa&s;ha, though he &s;aved his life, yet could not con|&s;erve
<PB N="239" REF="121">the Air of the Sultan's favour; for &s;o &s;oon as he arrived at the Court, he received an ill welcome; for according to the manner of Turks,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chu&s;aein</HI> Pa&s;ha im|pri&s;oned.</NOTE> who puni&s;h the ill &s;ucce&s;s of a Ge|neral equal to Crimes committed, he was im|mediately put into Chains, deprived of his e&s;tate and honours, and &s;ent pri&s;oner with the attendance only of two &s;ervants unto the Ca&s;tles of the <HI>Dardanelli,</HI> where the di&s;turbance and unquietne&s;s of his mind reduced him to an infirmity of Body; &s;o that being &s;ick, and without Friends or Phy&s;icians, he &s;ent to Sir <HI>John Finch,</HI> his Maje&s;ties Amba&s;&s;ador, as he pa&s;&s;ed up the <HI>Helle&s;pont,</HI> to afford him the u&s;e and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Phy&s;ician; but the Am|ba&s;&s;ador excu&s;ed him&s;elf, letting him know, that his Retinue being pa&s;&s;ed before on ano|ther Ve&s;&s;el, he was &s;orry it was not in his power to accommodate him in the manner he de&s;ired.</P>
<P>The Winter being now well entered, which is very wet and cold in tho&s;e Coutries, cau&s;ed the Armies on both &s;ides to draw into their warmet Quatters, there to meditate and con|trive their de&s;igns for the more active &s;ea&s;on.

The Turk on the other &s;ide though full of revenge and anger for their la&s;t misfortune, yet patiently took this lo&s;s as the paring only of his Nails, that his Claws might grow the longer, and was &s;o row&s;ed with this blow, that he &s;ummoned all the Nations of his large Empire to come in to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, towards which forty thou&s;and Carts laden with Provi&s;ions were appointed to rendezvous on the Banks of the <HI>Danube</HI> to|wards the end of the month of <HI>March.</HI> Yet in the mean time the Turks not having patience to &s;ee their perfidious Prince avail him&s;elf of his Revolt, and in De&s;pight of the Ottoman Power to to &s;eat him&s;elf in his Principality of <HI>Ja&s;h,</HI> were re&s;olved to drive him thence; and in order thereunto not ex|pecting a milder &s;ea&s;on, immediately di&s;peeded &s;ome Troops of Tartars, and two thou&s;and Spahees under the Command of a new Prince, to drive him out of the Country. In the mean time the Poles, &s;ince their late Victory, kept the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Kemenitz</HI> &s;traitly blocked up on all &s;ides, and thereby reduced them to &s;uch a want of food and other provi&s;ions, as might probably cau&s;e them to &s;urrender before the Summer could open a way to their relief.</P>
<P>But before I conclude this Year, I mu&s;t not omit to acquaint the Reader, that in the month of <HI>September</HI> an Engli&s;h Factor at <HI>Smyrna</HI> de&s;cended of good Parents, and educated under a &s;evere and religious Ma&s;ter, one who had a rea&s;onable E&s;tate of his own, and in good bu&s;i|ne&s;s and employment, did notwith&s;tanding in the ab&s;ence of his Partner, with whom he was joyned in Commi&s;&s;ion, carry out of the hou&s;e 215 &frac12; fine Cloths belonging to &s;everal Principals of <HI>England,</HI> with a con&s;iderable Sum of ready Mony, Jewels, and things of value: of which having po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, he went before the Kadi, and there in pre&s;ence of divers Officers of the City turned Turk, hoping by the Privi|ledge of the Mahometan Law, whereby no Chri&s;tian te&s;timony can pa&s;s again&s;t a Turk, to appropriate unto him&s;elf that whole E&s;tate, which he had thus treacherou&s;ly got into his &s;ole cu&s;tody. And it being impo&s;&s;ible for Turks to atte&s;t the Marks, Numbers, or know the E&s;tates of Per&s;ons being in <HI>England,</HI> he judged him&s;elf out of the reach of any Power or Art to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s him of his unju&s;t and wicked ac|que&s;ts. How&s;oever the Con&s;ul did &s;o clo&s;ely pur&s;ue him both at <HI>Smyrna</HI> and at the Turki&s;h Court, that in the &s;pace of &s;even months he regained all the Cloth, and the be&s;t part of the Mony and Jewels out of his hands: and in fine reduced this Renegado to &s;o low a condition, that he humbly &s;upplicated the Con&s;ul to con|trive a way for his pa&s;&s;age into <HI>England:</HI> at which time His Maje&s;ties Frigate the <HI>Cen|turion</HI> being then in Port, he was imbarked thereupon, and &s;o returned into his own Country.</P>
<P>The Particulars of all which having been amply related in Writing and Letters to pri|vate Friends, I purpo&s;ely omit the &s;ame in this place, that &s;o I might ca&s;t a veil over the nakedne&s;s and &s;hame of our Nation in that City.

The Polan|ders being thus pro&s;perous, made u&s;e of their &s;ucce&s;s, and the &s;harp cold of the Winter-&s;ea&s;on to make their Incur&s;ions, and Winter-quarters through all the Principalities of <HI>Moldavia;</HI> for they being born in cold Countries, and ac|cu&s;tomed to the Snows and Fro&s;ts, were more patient and enduring of extremity of weather than were the Turks, who were brought forth from more mild and moderate Climates: &s;o that neither could the Poles be driven out from tho&s;e Countries, nor <HI>Keminitz</HI> be relieved by them, until &s;uch time, that the Sun getting high, and thawing the Snows, and warming the Earth, prepared a &s;ea&s;on fit for return of the Turks who marching according to their cu&s;tom with an Army compo&s;ed of great multitudes, quickly compelled the Poles to retire. For the Grand Signior and Vizier having both &s;eated their Winter-quarters on the Banks of the <HI>Danube,</HI> were ready at the fir&s;t opening of the Summer to enter their Arms in|to the Enemies Countries; and having called the Tartars to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, did according to the u&s;ual cu&s;tom make Incur&s;ions for depredati|on of Slaves, Cattel, and what&s;oever el&s;e was portable in a running March.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chan</HI> or King of this People was at that time greatly indi&s;po&s;ed in his health, of which he advi&s;ed the Great Vizier, as if he intended thereby to obtain a relea&s;e from his per&s;onal at|tendance that year in the War: But the Vi|zier, who either &s;uppo&s;ed this excu&s;e to be only a pretence, or that he had a kindne&s;s for his Per&s;on, immediately di&s;patched away his own Phy&s;ician called Signior <HI>Ma&s;&s;elini,</HI> an Italian born, a worthy Learned man, a good Chri|&s;tian, and my intimate Friend: with whom maintaining a con&s;tant corre&s;pondence by Let|ters, he wrote me,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Journy into <HI>Tar|tary.</HI></NOTE> That from the Grand Sig|niors Quarters which were at <HI>Batadog</HI> near the Banks of the <HI>Danube,</HI> he arrived after &s;eventeen days Journey in <HI>Chrim,</HI> where (he &s;aid) he was received with &s;ingular honour and kindne&s;s by the Great <HI>Chan,</HI> whom he found to be a Prince of admirable prudence, gentlene&s;s, and genero&s;ity, but greatly afflicted with a Hypo|chondriacal Melancholy; which being an in|firmity of &s;ome years &s;tanding, was with the more difficulty removed; how&s;oever he was &s;o far from being uncapable to follow his Army, that he advi&s;ed him to divert his mind with the thoughts of War: which coun&s;el having taken, after thirty days abode in the Camp, he found him&s;elf much more chearful than be|fore, and greatly relieved of that pre&s;&s;ure of Melancholy and caliginous Vapours which of|fended his Brain. <Q>We are now (&s;aid he) at <HI>&V;&s;&s;ia</HI> at the Mouth of the <HI>Bori&s;thenes,</HI> which we have pa&s;&s;ed from the other &s;ide unto this, where the River is nine miles broad, from hence we are marching towards <HI>Bender</HI> upon the <HI>Nie&s;ter</HI> to pa&s;s into <HI>Moldavia,</HI> and there to joyn with the Ottoman Army. The Poles have &s;ent to demand Peace, but with con|dition, that <HI>Kemenitz</HI> be re&s;tored to them; which Propo&s;ition was with great di&s;dain re|jected, and will never be granted whil&s;t this Emperour reigns. The&s;e people greatly de|&s;ired a Peace with <HI>Poland,</HI> which the Electi|on of <HI>Sobieski</HI> for King may probably facili|tate; for not only they, but the Turks al&s;o dread a March into <HI>Poland,</HI> and are &s;o in|veterately bent to take revenge on the Mu&s;|covites and Co&s;acks, who lately became their Subjects, that they could accept of any rea&s;onable Terms of Accommodation with <HI>Poland.</HI> I for my part found <HI>Tartary</HI> a very plea&s;ant Country, plentiful of all Provi&s;i|ons, and the people much more courteous and obliging to the Strangers and Chri&s;tians, than tho&s;e Turks with whom you and I have conver&s;ed.</Q> Thus far <HI>Ma&s;&s;elini</HI> writes in commendation of the Tartars, and in farther confirmation hereof, I have read in &s;ome Books, That as to their Morals, there are very few Nations to be found le&s;s vicious, they are ex|tremely &s;evere and faithful, they have no Thieves or fal&s;e Witne&s;&s;es among&s;t them, little Inju&s;tice or Violence, and live in union and great tranquillity: the marvellous fidelity of the Captive Tartars in <HI>Poland</HI> is every day to be ob&s;erved, who never fail to return at the time appointed, when they are licen&s;ed upon their word to go and procure their Liberties by the exchange of Poli&s;h Pri&s;oners, which they execute punctually, or return them&s;elves, not failing a minute.

<P>The time for Armies to draw out of the Winter-quarters, and take the Field being now come, the Grand Signior and Vizier, with great numbers both of Hor&s;e and Foot pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Danube,</HI> and pro&s;ecuting their March to the Confines of <HI>Poland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Kemenitz relieved.</NOTE> they relieved <HI>Kemenitz</HI> in the fir&s;t place, the Poles at the News of their approach ra&s;ing the Siege.

In that interim, the Kadi coming to be changed, and another of more courage and &s;pirit &s;ucceeding in his place, believed that the be&s;t &s;ervice at his beginning and entrance into Office which he could perform towards the people, was to relieve them from the oppre&s;&s;ion of the Pa&s;ha, and per&s;wade them po&s;itively to refu&s;e the payment; who taking courage from their Chief, drove the Aga out of Town, with a thou&s;and menaces and re|proaches, Upon this News <HI>Mehmet</HI> Pa&s;ha re|turned again full of anger and indignation, but found not that ea&s;ie reception nor kind enter|tainment, as before; but on the contrary, the Gates were &s;hut again&s;t him, and the people abandoning their Habitations, with common con&s;ent re&s;olved to make a Journey, to the Grand Signior: and to &s;hew they were in ear|ne&s;t, proceeded &s;o far in their way as to <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> which is about ten miles di&s;tant from thence: the prejudice and danger of which complaint <HI>Mahomet</HI> Pa&s;ha greatly fearing, &s;ent Me&s;&s;en|gers to pacifie them with good words and pro|mi&s;es to relinqui&s;h his preten&s;ions, in ca&s;e they would return; but the uproar was &s;o great, that they found as much difficulty to quiet it, as the Town-Clerk in ancient times had to appea&s;e the Tumult rai&s;ed by the Silver&s;miths about <HI>Diana</HI> of the <HI>Ephe&s;ians.</HI> Being thus baffled at <HI>Kou&s;h-ada&s;ee,</HI> he vented his fury on &s;ome poor I&s;lands which he could more ea&s;ily ma&s;ter, and thence proceeded to <HI>Napoli di Romania,</HI> where the people being already alarmed with his behaviour, and violence of his actions in o|ther places, and encouraged by the example of <HI>Kou&s;h-ada&s;ee,</HI> upon his arrival there, without farther ceremony &s;hut their Gates, and appear|ed armed again&s;t him upon the Walls; at which entertainment and unexpected oppo&s;ition, the Pa&s;ha fearing &s;ome evil con&s;equences, &s;et &s;ail from thence, and cro&s;&s;ing again the Seas into <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> made <HI>Rhodes</HI> his next Port.

<P>But to return to the Actions at Land, which were matters of the greate&s;t importance.

<P>To the&s;e Wars among&s;t &s;ecular Per&s;ons and men of Arms were added Differences, and never to be decided Controver&s;ies between the Reli|gious of the Roman and Greek Churches at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The diffe|rence be|tween the Latines and Greeks at <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI></NOTE> who contending for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Holy Sepulchre of the King of Peace, rent that &s;eamle&s;s Coat of Chri&s;t, and managed their Controver&s;ie with more malice and ran|cour each again&s;t other, than Princes do, who invade one the other with Fire and Sword. For the Franks or We&s;tern Chri&s;tians &s;ubjected to the Popes Dominion, had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed for &s;everal Ages a right to the Holy Sepulchre, and enjoy|ed the honour of the cu&s;tody thereof, notwith|&s;tanding the pretences of the Greeks thereunto, who for many years in vain attempted at the Ottoman Court to obtain that Priviledge; for the Franks being ever more powerful by chari|table contributions brought from Chri&s;tendom, be&s;ides large Sums of Money from the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and always outbid the Market of the Greeks, and con&s;equently made u&s;e of &s;tronger arguments, than the adver&s;e Party could produce in defence of their cau&s;e. Until &s;uch time, that one <HI>Panaioti,</HI> a Greek born in the I&s;land of <HI>Scio,</HI> having by his parts and excellent addre&s;s arrived to the honour of being Interpreter for the We&s;tern Tongues to the Great Vizier, at length obtained that favour with his Ma&s;ter, that he &s;eldom refu&s;ed what&s;oever he with rea|&s;on and mode&s;ty reque&s;ted; and being a great Zelot in his Religion, and e&s;teemed the chief Patron and Support of the Greek Church, he &s;ecretly begged in behalf of his Country, the recovery of the Holy Sepulchre at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> out of the hands of the Franks; which the Vi|zier would not deny him, both to reward him for &s;ome &s;ervices already performed, and like|wi&s;e becau&s;e he knew that a conce&s;&s;ion of this nature would again rai&s;e the &s;pirits and animo|&s;ities of Chri&s;tians; the allaying and appea&s;ing of which being an office &s;olely in the power of him&s;elf, and the &s;upreme Authority, would certainly prove beneficial to the Ottoman Court. <HI>Panaioti</HI> having obtained this Command, and con&s;idering that the defence thereof would be a trouble to him, for that thereby he &s;hould cre|ate Enemies which were no le&s;s than Kings and Princes to contend with, and perhaps &s;hould live to &s;ee it rever&s;ed, wi&s;ely laid it by him, there to remain dormant until the time of his death; which happening the year pa&s;t, the Command was produced and brought to light, and was before the <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> of this year &s;et on foot at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and by virtue thereof the cu&s;tody of the Sepulchre &s;entenced by the Pa&s;ha and Kadi of that place to belong unto the Greeks, the which was occa&s;ion of &s;o great trouble and confu&s;ion, as di&s;turbed the Holy Fea&s;t, and pol|luted the Sacrifices with the blood of one or two per&s;ons, who mo&s;t earne&s;tly contended for the Priviledge of their Nation and Religion. Nor could this difference be decided here, but both &s;ides appealed to the Court above; which being heard and debated in publick Divan, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Sepulchre was adjudged in fa|vour of the Greeks; the Franks being only to in|joy a precarious the thereof, as Pilgrims and Strangers to the Country. How&s;oever the Fry|ers of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> would not tamely yield up their Right, but again re&s;olved to try their For|tune at the Court, having by means of <HI>F. Cani|&s;aries</HI> their Commi&s;&s;ario with expence of a great Sum of Money obtained a review of the ca&s;e, but without &s;ucce&s;s; for all the&s;e endeavours and charge proved fruitle&s;s, the former &s;en|tence being confirmed in favour of the Greeks; and the Franks having no other Expedient, ap|plied them&s;elves to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the French Amba&s;&s;adour, to who&s;e protection the Holy places are a&s;&s;igned by Capitulations. But nei|ther the power of the French Amba&s;&s;adour, nor of any other Chri&s;tian Repre&s;entative was avail|able; for the Vizier either mindful of his pro|mi&s;e to <HI>Panaioti,</HI> or being re&s;olute to maintain the Command he had given, would on no terms be per&s;waded to revoke it; the which intention of the Vizier being made known to the Greeks their Patriarch earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed a hearing of the ca&s;e; but the Fryars not willing to abide the &s;hock, retired to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> le&s;t the Greeks forcing them to Ju&s;tice, they &s;hould be con|demned <HI>in Judicio contradictorio,</HI> and a Hoget or Sentence pa&s;&s;ing, they &s;hould be condemned in Law as well as by Authority of the Hatte|&s;heriff. Which to put in execution, the Pa|triarch took out a Command whereunto was added, That the Fryers in token of their &s;ub|jection, &s;hould pay a Drachm of Silver a head to the Patriarch, and hold all their places of them. This was the i&s;&s;ue of the pre&s;ent contro|ver&s;ies, which is certainly determined for the time of the Vizier without revocation, yet per|haps in the time of another, it may admit of a review for money, e&s;pecially being received when as yet the new Mini&s;ter hath not &s;atiated his covetous de&s;ires; how&s;oever, the expence will always bechargeable, and the &s;ucce&s;s un|certain. Thus have I &s;een and ob&s;erved in this particular the effect and experience of two things; <HI>viz.</HI> The covetou&s;ne&s;s and pride of Fryars, and the conclu&s;ion of their Law-&s;uits before Infidels. The Franks, or the We&s;tern Chri&s;tians, had until this time the cu&s;tody of the Holy Sepulchre, and the Greeks that of the Chappel of <HI>Bethlem,</HI> but the u&s;e was free to both; but the Franks not being able to enjoy the Sepulchre with contentment, whil&s;t with envious eyes they beheld the Greeks in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on of <HI>Bethlem,</HI> were always contriving de&s;igns by force of money, and power of Chri&s;tian Mi|ni&s;ters to eject them from that Right; until that now in the&s;e contentions they have lo&s;t both; be|ing neither able to recover the one, nor con|&s;erve the other.</P>

<P>Sir <HI>John Narbrough</HI> having fitted him&s;elf at <HI>Ligorne,</HI> and recruited with an additional Squadron of &s;ix or &s;even Men of War he de|parted for <HI>Tripoly,</HI> taking under his Convoy, the <HI>Vyner, Bri&s;tol</HI> Merchant, and Mediterranean for <HI>Smyrna;</HI> and now appearing before the Port of <HI>Tripoly</HI> in a formidable manner, the <HI>Pyrates</HI> began to repent of their late violation, know|ing that they mu&s;t now either di&s;gorge their ill got goods, or prove the evil effects of War; their hearts began now to fail them, &s;o that they unrigged all their Ships, laying them up clo&s;e in the harbour, and with them for the pre&s;ent all thoughts of roving on the Seas; for &s;uppo&s;ing, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships could not lye alwaies in that Station, but that bad weather or want of provi&s;ions would enforce them &s;ome time to retire, they hoped in that interval to find an opportunity to lanch into the Seas, where being clear, and good Saylors, they might have room enough to e&s;cape. How|&s;oever Sir <HI>John Narbrough</HI> with his Squadron, continued with &s;uch diligence on the coa&s;t, plying them with continual allarms, &s;tanding off to &s;ea at night, and towards the land in the day; that they found not the heart, nor op|portunity to adventure abroad; until one of their Ships, which had formerly been their Rere-Admiral, bound with Negroes for the <HI>Morea;</HI> re&s;olved to hazard an e&s;cape; but not being able to make her pa&s;&s;age good, &s;he was forced a&s;hoar, and burnt by our Ship, mo&s;t of the Negroes falling into the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> hands; &s;ome few days after Sir <HI>John Narbrough</HI> fired three of their Galeots, burnt a Satee, took a fi&s;her-boat and a Sambechin; with which &s;ucce&s;s being encouraged, and the Enemy affrighted, their Ships were blocked up in Port for &s;ome months, whi&s;t ours found free pa&s;|&s;age on the Seas; until that at length growing weary of &s;o long a demorage, nece&s;&s;ity drove them to adventure abroad, which two of their be&s;t Men of War &s;ucce&s;sfully effected on the <HI>8th</HI> of <HI>September</HI> in de&s;pight of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Squadron, being a&s;&s;i&s;ted with calm weather, and help of their Oares: four others ob&s;erving the &s;ucce&s;s of the former in a few days after at|temted the like, and e&s;caped in the &s;ame manner. And now the Commanders of <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Ships in diver&s;e Ports, taking fal&s;e mea|&s;ures, on confidence that the <HI>Tripolines</HI> were blocked up in their Ports, tru&s;ted them|&s;elves with unadvi&s;ed &s;ecurity into the Seas; among&s;t which none was &s;o unfortunate, as a Ship called the <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> Merchant one <HI>Plummer</HI> Commander, laden with eighty two Bales of Silk, be&s;ides other rich commodities bound from <HI>Smyrna</HI> to <HI>Ligorne,</HI> whereon were &s;everal Merchants, &s;ome of which having lived many years in <HI>Smyrna</HI> had acquired plentiful E&s;tates:

The <HI>Tri|polines</HI> were greatly elevated with this rich prize which they immediately carried to a place called <HI>Derno;</HI> and there landing their goods, and men; for better &s;ecurity tran&s;ported them over land to <HI>Tripoli.</HI> The Per&s;ons we men|tioned before, were forced for the mo&s;t part to walk all the way a foot, being thirty four days journey, unle&s;s &s;ome times, they were favoured to mount a Camel, which is &s;uch an unplea&s;ant way of riding, that walking is much more ea&s;ie; and travailing in a &s;andy, dry Country, water was very &s;carce, the days journies being commonly proportioned according to the di&s;tance of the Wells of Water; which they drank with tetter Appetites, and Plea&s;ure, then they formerly relli&s;hed the mo&s;t plea&s;ant Wines. Being arrived at <HI>Tripoli</HI> they were ill wellcomed by the &s;evere looks, and hard diet which they received from their He&s;ts; and the Plague raging greatly in the City, added to the mi&s;eries, and dread of the place.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tripolines</HI> encouraged with this prize, and with the expectation of the farther &s;ucce&s;s of their Ships abroad, hoped to weary out the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Squadron, which &s;till continued to infe&s;t and trouble their coa&s;ts taking their Corn, Boats, and interrupting all Commerce which that Town had with the Sea. At length the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> re&s;olved to make an attempt on the Ships in Harbour which they re&s;olutely performed in the night, and with great &s;ucce&s;s according to this relation which Sir <HI>John Narbrough</HI> gave under his own hand.</P>

<P>The <HI>Tripolines</HI> being di&s;couraged, and af|frighted with this boldne&s;s and diligence of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and apprehending that they would always infe&s;t their coa&s;t, which would be an utter ruine, and de&s;truction to them; and be|ing touched in the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible parts of their intere&s;t, and wilfare; they generally concluded, that there was now no &s;afety, but by making a peace with the <HI>Engli&s;h:</HI> To farther which, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the Office of Mediation; it happened, that there was at the &s;ame time at <HI>Tripoly,</HI> one <HI>Haffse</HI> bey, a great man of <HI>Tunis,</HI> who had been Dei of that Country; but be|ing droven from thence by his Nephews, was come to <HI>Tripoly</HI> with an immen&s;e trea&s;ure, intending afterwards to Tran&s;port him&s;elf to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> to make his aggreivances known at the Grand Signiors Court. Of this per&s;on we &s;hall di&s;cour&s;e more at large hereafter; but in this place it is pertinent to relate, how in|&s;trumental he was to effect this peace in which he laboured with the greater zeal, that &s;o by a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> he might find a &s;peedy and &s;afe conveyance on their Ships of his Per&s;on, Goods, and Servants into the <HI>Morea,</HI> from whence he de&s;igned by land to <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> The Treaty being thus began; a peace was con|cluded between his Maje&s;ties of Great Britain, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and <HI>Halil Pa&s;ha, Ibrahim Dey, Aga, Divan</HI> and Governors of the Noble City, and Kingdom of <HI>Tripoly,</HI> Dated the fifth of <HI>March</HI> 1675/6.

<P><HI>Fir&s;t, that all Per&s;ons taken under Eng|li&s;h Colours &s;hould be delivered to Sir</HI> John Narbrough <HI>and &s;et at liberty without pay|ment of any ran&s;om for them; under which notion, Mr.</HI> Foley, <HI>Mr.</HI> Laxton, <HI>Mr.</HI> Turner, <HI>Mr.</HI> Gell, and <HI>Mr.</HI> Ti&s;on, <HI>with the Captain and Sea-men taken on the</HI> Bri&s;tol <HI>Merchant were freed; who&s;e ran|&s;om otherwi&s;e might have co&s;t dear, and perhaps almo&s;t the value of their private E&s;tates.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly, That eighty thou&s;and Dollars</HI> (<HI>which was the account made of the value of goods, and Mony taken on the</HI> Martin <HI>and</HI> Hunter) <HI>&s;hould be made good to Sir</HI> John Narbrough, <HI>in Mony, or Goods, and Slaves.

<P>And now the peace being concluded; Sir <HI>John Narbrough</HI> returned to <HI>Malta;</HI> and &s;oon after came back to <HI>Tripoly</HI> to receive the re|mainder of the monies, and goods agreed for, the Slaves being delivered already.

<P>On the &s;ixth of <HI>September</HI> 1675.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Civil War at <HI>Tunis</HI> in <HI>Bar|bary.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Morat Bei</HI> General of all the Land Forces in the Kingdom of <HI>Tunis</HI> dyed, the mo&s;t Politick, and Popular Per&s;on, that ever mannaged that Office, his Sons <HI>Ciddi Mehmet</HI> and <HI>Ciddi Ali</HI> by the gene|ral approbation, and con&s;ent of the Souldiery joyntly &s;ucceeding him in that charge. But the ambition of the&s;e two young Gallants would admit no union in the Government; the Elder would know no equal, and the younger no &s;uperior, &s;o that it was nece&s;&s;ary for one to govern, or both to be laid a&s;ide: the deci&s;ion of which was referred to a full A&s;&s;embly of the <HI>Turks.</HI> In the mean time <HI>Hoff&s;ey-bey</HI> Brother to <HI>Morat</HI> decea&s;ed, and Uncle to the two Com|petitors, taking advantage of the&s;e divi&s;ions, offered him&s;elf a Candidate for the place; and &s;o operated with the force of mony, and with a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the younger Nephew who would rather yield to an Uncle, then to a brother, that he clearly carried the election by the common &s;uffrages of the people. The Elder Son <HI>Ciddi Mehmet</HI> not enduring the indignity to be thus degraded took the field and &s;et up his &s;tandard; After him followed all his Fathers Old <HI>Spahees</HI> and the <HI>Moors</HI> abroad came into him, &s;o that in a few days he became &s;o formidable as to give Laws to the <HI>Dei</HI> and People of <HI>Tunis;</HI> obliging them immediately to bani&s;h his Uncle, and to re|ceive him as &s;ole, and ab&s;olute General of all the Land Souldiery in tho&s;e Dominions <HI>Hoff&s;e-bey</HI> not being able to re&s;i&s;t this force,
<PB N="250" REF="127">po&s;ted away with &s;uch expedition that he ad|ventured to embark him&s;elf, retinue and trea|&s;ure (which as was reported being mode&s;tly calculated, amounted to three millions of Dollars) on no better a Ve&s;&s;el, then a <HI>French Satte</HI> for <HI>Tripoli;</HI> where he was honourably received by that Government, and Letters &s;ent from them to the young <HI>Bei</HI> at <HI>Tunis,</HI> mediating for the return of his Uncle, with promi&s;e, that he &s;hould live quietly, and give no inter|ruption to the cour&s;e of his Government; but <HI>Ciddi Mehmet</HI> re&s;olving not to tru&s;t him, po&s;i|tively declared again&s;t his readmi&s;&s;ion, as not con&s;i&s;tent with his Government, and Safety.</P>
<P>It happened at this time that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had War with <HI>Tripoly,</HI> and blocked up the Port; and that afterwards a Peace en&s;uing; <HI>(Hoff&s;e-bey)</HI> (as we &s;aid before,) &s;howed him&s;elf very forward, and zealous in the Mediation; which taking effect; he was afterwards to|gether with his retinue tran&s;ported on the <HI>Bri&s;tol Fregat</HI> Commanded by Sir <HI>John Berry</HI> to <HI>Modon</HI> in the <HI>Morea,</HI> from whence he went by Land to carry his Complaints to <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople;</HI> whil&s;t the <HI>Bri&s;tol Fregat</HI> proceeded to <HI>Smyrna,</HI> to receive the <HI>Turky</HI> Companies Ships under Convoy for <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hoff&s;-bey</HI> being arrived at the Grand Signiors Court prepared an ea&s;ie and ready acce&s;s to the Grandees, by the great Pre&s;ents, he &s;ent them; which being the only means to mollify and make tender the hearts of <HI>Turks;</HI> he found upon all his addre&s;&s;es &s;uch re&s;entments, and compa&s;&s;ionate feelings of his aggreivances that if a&s;&s;urances in words, and promi&s;es would do his work, he might be a&s;certained of engaging the entire power, and pui&s;&s;ance of the Empire for his re-e&s;tabli&s;hment. The news of <HI>Hoff&s;e-bey;</HI> being gone to addre&s;s him&s;elf to the Turki&s;h Court for relief much perplexed the Government at <HI>Tunis;</HI> and at the &s;ame time the plague de&s;perately raging there, made them &s;ick, and infirm both in body, and mind: wherefore after &s;erious con&s;iderations and de|bates hereupon; it was concluded nece&s;&s;ary, to Fight <HI>Hoff&s;e</HI> with his own Weapons; and im|mediately to di&s;patch away four Ships for <HI>Con|&s;tantinople</HI> with Me&s;&s;engers, and Pre&s;ents to the Grand Signior and his Officers being the only means to open the rea&s;ons and under&s;tandings of the <HI>Turks,</HI> and make them as well capable to comprehend the ju&s;tice of their cau&s;e, as to reconcile their affections. The four Ships arriving at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> were &s;eized on, at the in&s;tance of <HI>Hoff&s;e-bey;</HI> and he declaring, that tho&s;e Ships were belonging to him, and his own proper E&s;tate, ea&s;ily procured a judg|ment in his favour; and the Captains of them being called to the <HI>Divan,</HI> were Commanded to own <HI>Hoff&s;e-bey</HI> for their Ma&s;ter, and to obey him as their Pa&s;ha, and ab&s;olute Lord under the Grand Signior. It was too late, when at <HI>Tunis</HI> they apprehended the Error, they had Committed, in &s;ending the&s;e four Ships to <HI>Con|&s;tantinople;</HI> which now upon more &s;erious con&s;ideration then the former they expected to return freighted with armed Men, and Im|perial Commands to re-e&s;tabli&s;h <HI>Hoff&s;e-bey</HI> in the Government of which, and of what was farther preparting at the Ottoman Court, that they might have good advice; they di&s;patched two Me&s;&s;engers for <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> on a French <HI>Satee,</HI> which they had freighted for that pur|po&s;e, to Land them at <HI>Smyrna;</HI> where being arrived they addre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to me, then Con&s;ul there, bringing me Letters of recom|mendation from friends at <HI>Tunis</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t and help them in all their occurences. I was well informed in all particulars concerning the &s;uc|ce&s;s, and motions of <HI>Hoff&s;e-bey</HI> at <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople,</HI> and I did not omit to relate all matters di&s;tinctly to them; for not long before, I had occa&s;ion to be acquainted with <HI>Hoff&s;e-bey</HI> him|&s;elf having at his earne&s;t reque&s;t found means to furni&s;h him with the Sum of three thou&s;and Dollars, upon a good Pawn of Gold, and Jewels; among&s;t which there was a Fetlock of Gold enameled, and &s;et with Diamonds, ju&s;t in the form and fa&s;hion of tho&s;e, which we put on our hor&s;es, when they go to gra&s;s; and this, I under&s;tood, was one of the Ornaments, which they put on the Ancle of the Bride on the marriage day; I know not whether it were to grace her legs, as bracelets do our wri&s;ts, or to put her in mind of her &s;ervitude, &s;o &s;oon as &s;he &s;ubmits to Wedlock. I acquainted them, as I &s;aid, with all matters: That the Grand Signior, and his Officers, had greatly re&s;ent|ed the &s;ufferings of <HI>Hoff&s;e-bey</HI> and that they own|ed his cau&s;e, having &s;topt the four Ships of <HI>Tunis</HI> at <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> and had promi&s;ed to furni&s;h him with a whole Chamber of Jani&s;aries, with a Licence to rai&s;e &s;uch Voluntiers on the Sea|coa&s;t of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> as would willingly, and of their own accord follow his Colours. I had not many days given them this intelligence, which others confirmed in like manner; before <HI>Hoff&s;e-bey</HI> him&s;elf with his four men of War and two other hired Ships arrived in the Port of <HI>Smyrna:</HI> where having &s;tayed &s;ome days to taken in provi&s;ions, and embark tho&s;e who had li&s;ted them&s;elves for his &s;ervice in tho&s;e Parts; they departed for <HI>Tunis,</HI> touching at <HI>Scio, Navarine,</HI> and <HI>Tripoly,</HI> in their Way, reinfor|cing them&s;elves with &s;uch, as voluntarily fol|lowed their Standard. The Me&s;&s;engers po&s;ted back with all &s;peed, on a Ve&s;&s;el hired at <HI>Smyrna;</HI> and arriving &s;ome time before <HI>Hoff&s;e-bey;</HI> ren|dered an account of the treatment which he had found at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> with the particulars of the forces he brought with him. The <HI>Tune&s;ines</HI> being prepared with this intelligence, took courage to oppo&s;e a handful of men, to whom they refu&s;ed Licen&s;e &s;o much as to one man of them to land; only out of re&s;pect to the Grand Signior's Commands, they were willing to admit <HI>Hoff&s;e-bey</HI> to a treaty; and to receive him a&s;hoar with three or four Servants and COmpanions; They &s;leightly peru&s;ed his Papers, rather to di&s;cover his &s;trength, and the porgre&s;s of his negotiations, then with inten|tions to conde&s;cend in the lea&s;t to his de&s;ires; which having done, and given permi&s;&s;ion to &s;ee his hou&s;e, and vi&s;it his wife, and children; they ha&s;tned him again aboard; and all the Country being in Arms, they threatned to treat him and his People, as Enemies, if they ad|ventured to make a de&s;cent. <HI>Hoff&s;e-bey</HI> being di&s;couraged with this rude Treatment, and with the Union, and general Confederacy of the people again&s;t him contrary to his expecta|tions; returned to <HI>Navarine;</HI> where he landed, di&s;charged his Ships, and Souldiers, which lay too heavy upon a Private Pur&s;e, and retired him&s;elf for &s;ome time with much melancholy and di&s;content; at length he travelled again to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> where the Turki&s;h Officers at|tended
<PB N="251" REF="127">his coming with open mouths, expecting to &s;hare once more in the recruits he had brought with him from <HI>Tunis.</HI> But his &s;tock being low, he was not able to di&s;pen&s;e his mony, and pre&s;ents &s;o generou&s;ly, and plentifully as before; which the <HI>Turks</HI> perceiving fell much in their re&s;pects for him, and &s;trangly on a &s;uddain lo&s;t wholly the zeal and compa&s;&s;ion for his cau&s;e; &s;uffering him to live at <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople</HI> in the Condition of a private Aga. In the mean time the di&s;turbances, and civil di&s;|&s;entions ran high at <HI>Tunis:</HI> the two Brothers waging War with various and interchangeable &s;ucce&s;s, cau&s;ed &s;uch agitions in the State, that in three months time four <HI>Deys</HI> were cut off. At length the younger Brother <HI>Ciddi Ali</HI> gain|ing the Victory, and always inclining towards his Uncle, con&s;ented that he &s;hould be recalled from <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> whereupon four Ships were fitted at <HI>Porto Farina,</HI> to carry pre&s;ents of atonement to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and to bring <HI>Hoff&s;e-bey</HI> from thence with Title of Pa&s;ha; whom the people now, expected with great impatience, as the only Per&s;on, who&s;e Pre&s;ence and Authority was able to &s;ettle, and re&s;tore them to their former quietne&s;s and union. This happened in the year 1677; when the Country was &s;o harra&s;&s;ed with Civil Wars, that a mi&s;erable Famine en&s;ued; &s;o that a Caffic&eacute; of Wheat which was ten Bu&s;hels, was &s;old for twenty eight Dollars, and of Barly for fourteen: and the &s;carcity of this Country which is commonly the Granary of <HI>Italy,</HI> had &s;uch influence on tho&s;e parts and <HI>Spain,</HI> in the years 1677 and 1678 that the Sate of the Grand Duke of <HI>Tu&s;cany</HI> &s;uffered much thereby; and had more, had not the State of <HI>Luca</HI> out of Friend&s;hip, and on the &s;core of Neighbour|hood relieved their nece&s;&s;ities.</P>

<P>PRopo&s;itions of peace not being &s;o earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed, nor &s;o advantageou&s;ly proffered by the Poles, as the pride of the Turks did expect, the War &s;till continued, but not pro&s;ecuted either on the one &s;ide or on the other with the &s;ame violence with which it began.

<P>For at the Cttoman Court the &s;ace of all things was become &s;erene and calm, no Sediti|nos of great men, nor di&s;contents of the people, nor balck and cruel de&s;igns of State di&s;turbed, or clouded the &s;plendour of the Solemnities,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The happy &s;tate of the Ottoman. Court.</NOTE> or the brows of the great Stati&s;ts, but all matters ran in an uninterrupted cour&s;e of Joy and Fe|&s;tivity. The Sultan, who in his action &s;hewed him&s;elf a mo&s;t benign Prince, &s;paring and com|pa&s;&s;ionate of the blood and mi&s;ery of his Sub|jects, hath, &s;ince his arrival to a mature Age, exerci&s;ed a wi&s;e manner of Government, &s;e|vere and ju&s;t, and yet void of the cruelty and tyranny of his Ance&s;tors; under whom the tra|ding Chri&s;tian enjoyed the privilege of their Capitulations with more ju&s;tice, and le&s;s fre|quent Avanias. The Vizier al&s;o, and other great Officers, being &s;en&s;ible of the benefit which Trade begat, treated Merchants with more gentlene&s;s and re&s;pect than in former times, their Ships not being forced on every occa&s;ion into the Grand Signior's &s;ervice, but rather per|&s;waded to it by rewards and fair promi&s;es, otherwi&s;e than in the times of former Viziers, and it is to be wi&s;hed al&s;o that the like might be &s;aid under the Government of tho&s;e which are to &s;ucceed; though if we look forward to the years 1678 and 1679 we &s;hall find the Scene of things altered, and not only Merchants, but even Amba&s;&s;adors, and the Repre&s;entatives them&s;elves, remain under &s;ad di&s;couragements, Among&s;t the&s;e joys and gentle ways of Govern|ment; the manner of this Court was much al|tered; the Divan had not for two months &s;pace been opened for bu&s;ine&s;s, to the great prejudice and interruption of Ju&s;tice; Wine, that great abomination to the Turki&s;h Law, which four years pa&s;t was by the Imperial Decree forbid|den under pain of Death and a thou&s;and Ex|ecrations and Cur&s;es, was now the common Drink, and diverti&s;ement in fa&s;hion, u&s;ed im|moderately by all, excepting the Grand Sig|nior, the Mufti, and Reis Effendi; the Vizier him&s;elf having been exce&s;&s;ively intemperate therein, had extingui&s;hed the natural heat of his &s;tomach, which could be warmed by no le&s;s heat than what proceeds from <HI>Aqua Vitae;</HI> by which debauchery and indi&s;po&s;ition all Bu&s;i|ne&s;&s;es were &s;lowly and negligently di&s;patched, and according to his example the Officer and Mini&s;ters acted in their Affairs, which in former times being always, di&s;patched by nine a Clock in the Morning, that became now the time and hour of ri&s;ing.</P>
<P>The Grand Signior him&s;elf, though not taught by his Attendants to drink Wine, le&s;t it &s;hould perhaps betray him to &s;ome actions dangerous to them, gave him&s;elf to Amours; for falling in love with a Poli&s;h Woman, lately captivated at <HI>Kemenitz,</HI> he made her his Second Ha&s;akee or Sultane&s;s; for having had the good fortune to bring him a Son, that honour was the re|ward of her fruitfulne&s;s; and that he might give other te&s;timonies of his favour, he ca&s;t his eyes on a poor Chinganee, or Gip&s;y Boy, who with &s;inging and dancing &s;o plea&s;ed him, that he gave him &s;ix pur&s;es of money containing three thou&s;and Dollars, with Hor&s;es and Ser|vants, and took him into the Seraglio. Amid&s;t the&s;e Delights the Grand Signior gave order to the Vizier not to &s;peak to him of three things: Neither of returning to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> nor again&s;t his Favourite, nor again&s;t his Hunt|ing; in other matters he might u&s;e free|dom.</P>

<P>Another alteration of a better nature, with reference to Learning and Knowledge, &s;eems al&s;o remarkable in this Court; for the Grand Signior having been &s;ome years pa&s;t pre&s;ented by the Dutch Re&s;ident, with twelves large Volumes of the new <HI>Atlas,</HI> upon an accidental &s;ight thereof was &s;o plea&s;ed, that he commanded it &s;hould &s;peedily be tran&s;lated into Turki&s;h; to which Work Dr. <HI>Alexandro Mauro Cordato,</HI> the Viziers Interpreter, who &s;ucceeded in the place of <HI>Panaioti</HI> decea&s;ed, was nominated; but he finding it too unweildy for him, de&s;ired the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a French Je&s;uit, then at <HI>Scio,</HI> skil|ful in the Turki&s;h and Arabick Languages, who was immediately &s;ent for, and therein employ|ed; and though it is thought, that this bu&s;ine&s;s is above their Element, and that it will &s;oon cool and be neglected, yet it &s;eems to be the fir&s;t &s;tep which the Turks have made unto Learning, and therefore is the more ob&s;ervable.</P>
<P>And now the Fe&s;tivals beginning on the <HI>16th.</HI> of <HI>May,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The great Fe&s;tivals in what manner celebrated at the Tur|ki&s;h Court.</NOTE> we mu&s;t for &s;ome days lay a&s;ide all bu&s;ine&s;s, and ob&s;erve with what order and form the&s;e Solemnities were performed. In the fir&s;t place. On this day the Grand Signior, with the young Prince his Son, went to their Tents, which were pitched very &s;umptuou&s;ly in the Plain near the City, and indeed were truly &s;tately and magnificent; all the great men, as the Vizier, Mufti, and others, having their Pa|vilions erected; among&s;t which was rai&s;ed a very &s;tately Throne, with a Canopy of Cloth of Gold, extended under the &s;hady leavine&s;s of two tall Elms, which, &s;et off with many Lamps, in the Night repre&s;ented a very plea&s;ant and glorious Scene. On this Seat of State the Sultan placed him&s;elf in the morning, being ac|companied thither by all the Pa&s;haws then pre|&s;ent, and by the Rrepre&s;entatives of tho&s;e who were ab&s;ent; who according to their Degree, in order ki&s;&s;ing his Ve&s;t, delivered in a Silk Pur&s;e, a Note or Schedule of their Pre&s;ents, which were afterwards put into the Tefterdar's or Lord Trea&s;urers hands to &s;ee and compare them with the particulars received; which were &s;o great and con&s;iderable, that they far &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the Charges and Disbur&s;ments of the Solemnity. Oppo&s;ite to the Tents were &s;everal poles fixed, between which at Night were hung Lamps of &s;everal &s;hapes, which be|ing varied every Night made a very plea&s;ing and magnificent Object; by light of which in the Evening were exerci&s;ed &s;everal tricks of Acti|vity, as Wre&s;tlings, Dancing, and Singing, and &s;ometimes were acted Turki&s;h Comedies, which con&s;i&s;t only of Farces, and &s;ome ridi|culous Dialogues, and at la&s;t the diverti&s;ements of the night concluded with Fire-works, which were &s;o many, that (as reported) 240 men were employed for four months time in the ma|in Chri&s;tendom; only one &s;eemed to excel the re&s;t, being a &s;ort of Rocket, which went up very high, without any tail of fire, like the common ones, carrying only a &s;mall com|pacted Globe of red fire like a Star, and mak|ing to noi&s;e in mounting, but rai&s;ed to its height, breaks. The&s;e were the pa&s;times of the Night; in the day time all the &s;everal Arts and Trades, &s;ome one day, and &s;ome another, pa&s;&s;ed before the Tents, every one offering their Pre&s;ents, as they pa&s;&s;ed, repre&s;enting by &s;ome kind of Pa|geant and Proce&s;&s;ion their diver&s;ities of Trade: this continued for fifteen days. On the <HI>25th.</HI> of this in&s;tant <HI>May,</HI> was a &s;olemn Cavalcade, in which marched the Jani&s;aries with all their chief Officers, Chiau&s;es, and Mutafaracas, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And of the Great Men, the Vizier, Mufti, and <HI>Kul-ogli</HI> the Favourite, the fir&s;t on the right hand, and the &s;econd in the middle; after them followed the young Prince who was to be cir|cumci&s;ed, extraodinary rich in the Furniture of his Hor&s;e, and the number and largene&s;s of the Diamonds, which were on his Tulbant and Brea&s;t. In this Cavalcade were carried twenty four &s;mall Nachils, and two large ones, as high as the Ma&s;t of a Ship, which were carried by a hundred Slaves, and &s;et before the Seraglio, which are in form of triumphant Pyramids, adorned with Tin&s;ils in thirteen Divi&s;ions, according to this following Form or De&s;|cription.</P>

<P>On the <HI>27th.</HI> being the day of <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Birth, the Grand Signior rode publickly to the Mo&s;ch of Sultan <HI>Selim,</HI> having no other atten|dance than the Retinue of his own Court; his Pages were very rich in Cloth of Gold, each carrying a Feather &s;tudded with a rich Jewel on his Head; after the Grand Signior rode the young Prince, who that Night was circumci&s;ed. During this Fe&s;tival, a va&s;t number of people was fed at the charge of the Grand Signior, and about two thou&s;and circumci&s;ed, every one of which had a Quilt given him, with a &s;mall pay of three A&s;per a day for his Life.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The man|ner of the Marriage of the Grand Signior's Daughter.</NOTE></P>
<P>This Solemnity for the Circumci&s;ion being ended, on the <HI>10th.</HI> of <HI>June</HI> began the Fea&s;t for the Marriage. The Kuzlir Aga, who is the black Eunuch of the Women, was Bridegroom or Compar&eacute; to the young Prince&s;s, and the Tef|terdar or Lord Trea&s;urer to <HI>Kul-ogli,</HI> both which in the name of the Bride and Bridegroom went before the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice called the Kadele&s;|cher, and by him had the Articles of Marri|age wrote, and pa&s;&s;ed into publick Act; which being done, the Pre&s;ents were &s;ent, and fir&s;t tho&s;e from the Bridegoom to the Bride, which were the&s;e, a great number of Bea&s;ts and Birds ill-favouredly made in Sugar, thirty Mules la|den with two Che&s;ts of Sweet-meats a piece, and about their necks each carried a Ve&s;t of Sattin for the Muletiers, then were carried a great many Pots of Sherbet, then an hundred and twelve men carrying Ve&s;ts of Silk, Cloth, Vel|vet, and Cloth of Gold, &s;ome had three, &s;ome five or &s;ix at lea&s;t wrapt up in Linen; then went five Hor&s;es, one with rich Furniture; then fol|lowed a noble Ve&s;t of Cloth of Gold lined with Sables and nine Buttons and Loops on a &s;ide embroidered with large Pearl, on the top of which on the one &s;ide was a very large Dia|mond, and on the other a Saphire, with Shoes, Boots, and Pattents for the Bagno, all covered with Pearl; likewi&s;e two Dre&s;&s;ing-boxes, with Looking-gla&s;&s;es, and a Cap in form of a Crown, a little Cabinet embroidered all over with Pearl, eight Girdles &s;et with Emeralds, Rubies, and Diamonds, a large Diamond-ring, a pair of Pendants of two great Emeralds, with many other particulars, which in pa&s;&s;age were im|po&s;&s;ible to be remembred.</P>
<P>The&s;e Pre&s;ents being thus performed on the part of the Bridegroom to his Bride, the next Pre&s;ents concerned the Grand Signior to his Daughter, which were in place of her Dowry according to the cu&s;tom of the Ea&s;tern Countries: wherefore the <HI>19th.</HI> of this month the Pre&s;ents were u&s;hered with a mo&s;t &s;olemn Cavalcade of all the Grandees of the Court to the Hou&s;e of the Bridegroom, which were two Gardens made of Sugar, forty little Na|chils, eighty &s;ix Mules laden with Hou&s;hold|&s;tu&s;f, ten men with her Dre&s;&s;ings, as Boots, Shoes, &amp;c. embroidered with Pearl as the for|mer; then were carried her Jewels &s;et in Gir|dles, Bracelets, &amp;c. promi&s;cuou&s;ly together, not in that rule as tho&s;e were which were &s;ent her by the Bridegroom. The Hou&s;hold-&s;tuff was made up with coverts, yet how&s;oever &s;ome parts were left open on the &s;ides, to &s;hew that the Cu&s;hions were embroidered with Pearl, and others were of Velvet embroiderded with Gold. At la&s;t came twelve Coaches with Slaves and thirty &s;ix black Eunuchs. The <HI>23d.</HI> the Bride was conducted to her Bridegrooms Palace with a &s;olemn Cavalcade, with two great Nachils of the &s;ame form and bigne&s;s as tho&s;e carried at the Cavalcade of the Prince, with two &s;maller ones of Silver. The Bride was &s;eated in a hand|&s;om Coach drawn with &s;ix Hor&s;es, and cover|ed with Plates of Silver, and the &s;ides adorned with long Streamers of Tin&s;el: before which went the Kuzlit Aga or chief black Eunuch of of the Women: after followed four Coaches, with Six Hor&s;es apiece, and twenty one more with four Hor&s;es, each carry|ing two Eunuchs: than at &s;ome di&s;tance off came the Ha&s;akee or Queen-Mother to the Bride in a Coach all covered with Plates of Silver, and attended with ten other Coaches more: the night following the Bride was con|ducted to the Nuptial Chamber in ceremony only, &s;he not being yet ripe for con&s;ummation of Marriage: all which Solemnity was attended at the Bridegrooms Court, with the &s;ame Sports and Fire-works which were made at the Tents, with an addition of dancing on the Ropes, and &s;liding down a Rope fa&s;tned to the top of the Steeple of the Mo&s;ch of Sultan <HI>Selim,</HI> which had like to have proved fatal to one who came down with a Boy at his back; for when he was about twenty yards from the ground, the Rope broke, but falling on a tree fir&s;t, and then on a man, he was taken up with little hurt. The mo&s;t re|markable of all the&s;e Shows was a man that walked up a Rope as high asthe &s;econd Balcony of the Menareh or Steeple of Sultan <HI>Selion,</HI> which is as high as commonly our Spire-Steeples are in <HI>England:</HI> And another hanging on a Rope with his hands, with his body extended, turned him&s;elf twelve times round with his hands: at all which Sight the Grand Signior was a con&s;tant Spectator. In this manner the&s;e So|lemities ended, the Mo&s;ayp or Favourite rich in the e&s;teem of his Prince, and in high honour with all, had yet &s;ome allay to attemper and moderate his joy; for the Prince&s;s not yet fit for con&s;ummation, in ca&s;e &s;he dyed before that time, all her Jewels and Goods mu&s;t return to the Grand Signior, notwith&s;tanding which he would be obliged to pay her Dowry, which was &s;aid to be the Sum. of two years Revenue of Grand <HI>Cairo,</HI> but let it be what it will, he will be in|&s;olvent, being, as reported, three hundred Pur|&s;es already in debt. And now to demon&s;trate the uncertainty of the Courts of Princes, as well as of all other places and conditions of the World, the Great Tefterdar or Trea&s;urer, who had for the &s;pace of thirteen years managed this Office with &s;ingular indu&s;try and advan|tage, was now removed from thence, and un|der a &s;pecious &s;hew of Preferment, was ad|vanced to the Dignity of Pa&s;ha of Grand <HI>Cairo:</HI> this change was the more wondered at, becau&s;e he was a Per&s;on &s;o acute and &s;o proper for the Office,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Tefter|dar put out of his Office.</NOTE> that no man that held the place did ever manage it with greater reputation, nor with greater benefit to the Intere&s;t of his Prince; for be&s;ides his good husbandry in other mat|ters, he was &s;o skilful in knowing the price of Commodities, and &s;o near in making his Bar|gains, that the Merchant could &s;carce live by him, which in that con&s;umption of Goods made in the Seraglio, will produce a con&s;iderable abatement when all things are bought at the be&s;t hand; con&s;idering which, many rea&s;ons were alledged, and conjectures made of his re|moval: &s;ome &s;aid, That the Grand Signior having a liking to a young Man of his, to prevent his being taken into the Seraglio, the Tefter|dar
<PB N="254" REF="130">gave him a Wife, and thereby greatly di&s;|plea&s;ed the Grand Signior, as if he had purpo&s;e|ly contrived it, to defeat his de&s;ires: others &s;aid, That the Grand Signior would have bor|rowed money of him to pay the Arrears of the Spahees, which he refu&s;ed to lend: but others talked, and that with be&s;t rea&s;on, That <HI>Kara Mu&s;tapha</HI> the old Chimacam, who is always with the Grand Signior, had found an oppor|tunity to repre&s;ent him ami&s;s, &s;ugge&s;ting, that the Tefterdar &s;hould &s;ay, That want of money in the Trea&s;ury was cau&s;ed by the va&s;t Sums con&s;umed in the fooleries of the late Fea&s;ts:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ways for rai&s;ing Money.</NOTE> and the Vizier, though he entertained no per|&s;onal animo&s;ity again&s;t him, yet was willing to &s;acrifice him to the friend&s;hip of <HI>Kara Mu&s;tapha.</HI> And &s;o being di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of his Office, there|unto &s;ucceeded the Jani&s;ary <HI>Efendi</HI> or Judge-Advocate of the Jani&s;aries, a great Drinker of Wine, and one not to hold any compari&s;on with the parts and abilities of his Predece&s;&s;our. Money now wanting greatly in the Trea&s;ury, &s;everal ways were &s;ought to bring it in, and to &s;ave expences. The fir&s;t of which was, that a review be made of all Otoraks, &s;uch as <HI>Milites emeriti,</HI> who are excu&s;ed from the War, and yet receive their pay; from which number tho&s;e were excluded who had bought it, or were not come legally by it, which would &s;ave the Grand Signior a va&s;t Sum of Money yearly: and to help at this time of need, the late Trea&s;urer mu&s;t refund and ea&s;e him&s;elf of mo|ney, before he enters on that rich and impor|tant Office of Grand <HI>Cairo.</HI> And <HI>Chu&s;aein</HI> Aga the chief Cu&s;tomer, who was a man that had inriched him&s;elf by many bad ways and arts, was di&s;placed from his Office, and cau&s;ed to di&s;gorge great Sums of Money to add unto the Supplies of the Trea&s;ury. He was a Per&s;on of a &s;ubtle di&s;po&s;ition, rai&s;ed from the mean degree of a Shoemaker, and being well acquaint|ed both with good and bad ways of gaining money, was a proper In&s;trument for the Tur|ki&s;h Government, it being his fortune to fi&s;h riches rather for others than him&s;elf. And now being deprived of his Office and the be&s;t part of his Wealth, he re&s;olved, like all other di&s;con|tented Mini&s;ters, to take a Pilgrimage to <HI>Mecha,</HI> and to that end made a &s;olemn Vi&s;it to the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Cairo,</HI> then in his Tents near <HI>Scutari,</HI> acquainting him of his intentions to wait on him, and perform his Re&s;pects in his pa&s;&s;age to the Holy <HI>Keblech</HI> or <HI>Mecha.</HI></P>
<P>The Turks have not of late years been very prodigal of the blood of their Subjects, nor have tho&s;e Executions been done of late on any Offi|cer, unle&s;s his Tyranny and Oppre&s;&s;ion of the people did ju&s;tly draw due puni&s;hment upon him&s;elf. And &s;uch was the ca&s;e of the Kahya or Secretary of the Chimacam or Governour in the Viziers ab&s;ence of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> who taking on him&s;elf the management of all the Affairs of his Ma&s;ter, acted every thing according to his own plea&s;ure; for finding that what&s;oever he did or propounded, was always confirmed and a&s;&s;ented unto by his ea&s;ie Lord, he a&s;&s;um|ed a boldne&s;s to undertake any thing upon the proffers of mony, &s;o the Sum was in any manner agreeable to the greatne&s;s of the matter required,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chi|macam of <HI>Con&s;tan|tinople</HI> his Steward cut off.</NOTE> or to the danger he incurred; by which means he involved his carele&s;s and unwary Ma&s;ter in &s;uch intrigues, as could have no excu&s;e be&s;ides his own &s;upinene&s;s, and the corruptne&s;s of his Servant. At this manner of admini&s;tring Ju&s;tice, the people being di&s;contented, ha&s;tened the removal of the Chi|macam: and now another entring on the Office, the Kahya remained expo&s;ed to the malice and complaints of all his Enemies, among&s;t which none was of greater force than an accu&s;ation laid again&s;t him, for having granted leave to the Armenian Chri&s;tians at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> for a Sum of Money to erect a Church; for which, though a Command was granted by the Great Vizier, obtained at a good price, to build one there of Timber, but of a low and mean Fabrick; yet the Kahya for a greater Sum of twenty Pur|&s;es of Money, or ten thou&s;and Dollars, im|proved this Command, and changed their Materials from Timber to Stone and Mor|tar: the which Building beginning to ri&s;e with &s;ome magnificence, offended the neighbouring Turks with &s;o much &s;candal, that great num|bers of them carried the Complaints thereof to the Grand Signior; who calling the Vizier, and examining the Ca&s;e, the Vizier would own no other Command, than for repairing of an old Church, but not building one new.

<P>We have thus far di&s;cour&s;ed of the Affairs at home, which con&s;i&s;ted for the mo&s;t part in jollities and diverti&s;ements; let us now look on the enterprizes and attempts abroad, and we &s;hall find no great matter of action this year per|formed again&s;t <HI>Poland,</HI> more than &s;ome incur|&s;ions made into <HI>&V;krania</HI> by the Turks and Tar|tars under the Conduct of <HI>Ibrahim</HI> Pa&s;ha, in which we have no Battels, nor great Skirmi&s;hes to recount, only a &s;eizure or &s;urprize of tho&s;e Co&s;acks, which were not under the juri&s;diction of <HI>Doro&s;ensko,</HI> who like &s;heep were driven from their pa&s;tures, and Men, Women, and Chil|dren carried away into Captivity, and tran&s;|planted into Countries, where they might bet|ter &s;erve the purpo&s;es and de&s;igns of the Tur|ki&s;h Empire; to which ends al&s;o va&s;t numbers of Tartars with their Families, were called to in|habit the circumjacent parts of <HI>Kemenitz,</HI> for better &s;ecurity of the Conque&s;t, to which the Tartars mo&s;t willingly concurred, e&s;teeming it a happy Bargain to exchange the Soil of <HI>Tar|tary</HI> for the fruitful Plains, and more gentle Air of <HI>Poland.</HI> And thus we may con&s;ider what the inte&s;tine Di&s;cord of the Poles hath brought upon them&s;elves; that they, who in former days maintained their honour and reputation with the Turks, beyond any of the bordering Nations; not having every &s;uffered them to con|tinue in their Country, much le&s;s to &s;ojourn or po&s;&s;e&s;s one palm of Ground therein; can now more ea&s;ily &s;ee them before the Walls of <HI>Leo|polis</HI> or <HI>Cracovia,</HI> and planted in the very Bow|els of their Countrey, rather than a King of their own Countrey &s;et over them not agree|able to their own humour and fancy; or perhaps rather than behold the envied exaltation of &s;ome per&s;ons to dignity, or &s;ome little di&s;orders in their Government; of which the Turk knows well to make u&s;e, it being no new Le&s;&s;on for him, to profit him&s;elf of the Di&s;cord and Ani|mo&s;ities of the Chri&s;tians.</P>

<P>In like manner the Marine Affairs of the Turks this year afforded little worthy of ob&s;er|vation, unle&s;s it were, That the Captain Pa&s;ha was employed with about thirty Sail of Gallies into the Black Sea, for tran&s;porting of Ammu|nition and Provi&s;ions to tho&s;e Forces in <HI>&V;kra|nia;</HI> but he returned not with an equal num|ber of Gallies, with which he departed, hav|ing lo&s;t five of them by &s;torm, and then ar|rived at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> on the <HI>26th.</HI> of <HI>October,</HI> called by the Greeks the Fea&s;t of St. <HI>Demetrius,</HI> and by the Turks <HI>Ca&s;&s;in-gheun,</HI> a day which is commonly remarkable for Storms at Sea; of which the Turks and Greeks are &s;o aprehen&s;ive or &s;uper&s;titious, that on that day or near that time, either before or after, until the &s;torm hath vented its fury, and taken its cour&s;e, they will not adventure them&s;elves unto the Sea, up|on the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing occa&s;ion, or hopeful in|ducement what&s;oever.</P>
<P>And here I judge it requi&s;ite to conclude this Year with two matters very ob&s;ervable relating unto Trade: The fir&s;t is with reference unto the Genoue&s;es, who in the Year 1666. fir&s;t &s;ent their Amba&s;&s;ador Signior <HI>Durazzo,</HI> with many Pre&s;ents and great Magnificence to conclude a Peace with the Ottoman Empire, with the &s;ole de|&s;ign and intention of Trade; which having been e&s;tabli&s;hed on no other foundation at the begin|ning, than that of their Temins,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Trade of <HI>Genoua.</HI></NOTE> and the Fabrick of their own Cloth, when the fir&s;t failed, as it did in two years after, and that their Cloth turned not to account, but was out-&s;old by the Engli&s;h and Dutch, then their Trade began to decay, or rather never came to perfection, like the fruit of a young tree, which buds fairly, and produ|ces fruit, but hath not &s;trength to dige&s;t or bring it to maturity: Even &s;o it was with the Genou|e&s;es, who having been at the charge of an Am|ba&s;&s;adour Extraordinary, and &s;etled a Re&s;ident at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and a Con&s;ul at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> and all the other Formalities of Trade, wanted that nouri&s;hment thereof from their own &s;oil, which produces the true and natural fruit of Commerce, which is gain and profit; and be|ing out-done by other Nations in &s;hipping, there could little or no benefit be expected from their own Navigation in the Levant. For the&s;e rea|&s;ons, their Trade failing, the Duties of Con|&s;ulage on Goods appointed to maintain the Officers, and defray the publick Expences, were con&s;equently wanting; &s;o that the Count <HI>Fie&s;chi</HI> Re&s;ident for that Republick at <HI>Con&s;tan|tinople,</HI> finding him&s;elf in great di&s;tre&s;&s;es and nece&s;&s;ities, and unable to maintain him&s;elf and his Attendants agreeable to his Character and Quality, often advi&s;ed his Prince and the Senate of the unhappy &s;tate of their Affairs, de&s;iring from them either to provide a Supply agreeable to the occa&s;ions, or to recal him from that Office, where he could no longer live in that Honour required. This importunity produced the exchange of Officers, and the Mi&s;&s;ion of Signior <HI>Giu&s;tiniano</HI> to re&s;ide at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and Signior <HI>Gentile</HI> at <HI>Smyrna;</HI> the fir&s;t of which, &s;ome few days after his arrival, being unfor|tunately killed with a Carabine in his Chamber at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> as before related, the Office of Re&s;ident came to be &s;till continued in the per&s;on of <HI>Fie&s;chi,</HI> who remaining without pro|vi&s;ions nece&s;&s;ary to maintain his degree, and the annual Pre&s;ents expected by the Turks, which they e&s;teem as due as their Income, and as part of their Revenues, was forced to take up money on Pawns, and his own Credit at the Intere&s;t of 20, 25, or 30 <HI>per cent.</HI> according as his ne|ce&s;&s;ities increa&s;ed; and the apprehen&s;ions men conceived of an in&s;ufficiency and hazard in their &s;ecurity, was the cau&s;e that the debt, which in the beginning was incon&s;iderable, in|crea&s;ing with Intere&s;t upon Intere&s;t, came at length to the Sum of &s;ixty or &s;eventy thou&s;and Dollars, which the Republick of <HI>Genoua,</HI> at|tributing in a great mea&s;ure to the ill Conduct of <HI>Fie&s;chi,</HI> and judging the greate&s;t part of this debt to be feigned, &s;ent another Re&s;ident called Signior <HI>Spinola</HI> to &s;ucceed him in his Office, who arriving at <HI>Smyrna</HI> in the month of <HI>May</HI> of this pre&s;ent year, on a &s;tout Ship hired of the Venetians, and under the notion of a Man of War accompanied with a Merchant Ship, and a new Con&s;ul (the old one dying the year before) &s;etled there &s;uch Orders, as were judged nece&s;&s;ary for the government of their Affairs. But before the&s;e Genoue&s;es arrived, a report had fore-ran them from <HI>Ligorne</HI> and other parts, that their Ships brought great quantities of fal&s;e Gold and fal&s;e Pieces of Eight: the which com|ing to the ears of the Turks, Commands were provided again&s;t their arrival to &s;earch their Ships, and try their Monies; to which the Genoue&s;es not conde&s;cending, Arz or te&s;timony was made thereof by the Kadi unto the Grand Signiors Court. In the interim whil&s;t this Arz went up, and the an&s;wer expected, the Ge|noue&s;e Re&s;ident de&s;igning to proceed forward on his Voyage to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> demanded the Kadi's Mora&s;elau or Ticket of Licence for the Man of War on which he came, to pa&s;s the Ca&s;tle, (for that Ship had entred within the Port.) The Kadi judging it nece&s;&s;ary, that both the Re&s;ident and Ship &s;hould attend the arrival of the an&s;wer from above, refu&s;ed to grant this Licence; whereupon the Re&s;ident all in a rage imbarked him&s;elf, and immediately &s;et &s;ail, and having a fair Breez out of the Port, gently &s;lided along by the &s;ide of the Ca&s;tle without any &s;top or interruption.</P>
<P>This affront being put upon the Kadi, greatly di&s;plea&s;ed him; &s;o that calling the Lieutenant and Gunner of the Ca&s;tle into que&s;tion, and not admitting of their Plea, that the Ship was a Man of War, and the per&s;on thereon a Re&s;i|dent, both which were privileged, and both going up to the Grand Signiors Court, were to an&s;wer there for what was laid again&s;t them; but this I &s;ay, not being admitted for rea&s;on, the Kadi committed them both to Pri&s;on, from whence with &s;ome charge afterwards they relea|&s;ed them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The new Re&s;ident being arrived at <HI>Con&s;tan|tinople,</HI> the Creditors of Count <HI>Fie&s;chi</HI> demand|ed payment of the debts owing to them, which was given in, to amout to &s;ixty thou&s;and Dol|lars, and &s;o much was to be paid before <HI>Fie&s;|chi</HI> &s;hould be permitted to depart, or at lea&s;t that part thereof being &s;atified in hand, the new Re&s;ident <HI>Spinola</HI> &s;hould give &s;ecurity for payment of the remainder: the which he re|fu&s;ing to do, as not owning the accounts which <HI>Fie&s;chi</HI> had given in, in regard he judged them to be compo&s;ed of extravagant Intere&s;ts, and to ari&s;e on charges not allowable by that Re|publick, who after the death of <HI>Giu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">tiniano</HI> di&s;owned <HI>Fie&s;chi</HI> for their Mini&s;ter; hereupon great di&s;turbances and commotions aro&s;e a|mong&s;t the Creditors, &s;ome of which being in great Power, as the Jani&s;ary-Aga and others,
<PB N="256" REF="131">Seque&s;tration was laid on their Man of War; &s;o that &s;he was toaed away to the Ar&s;enal, and there laid up, and attached for payment of the debt: which ari&s;ing on the account of the Pub|lick, the Goods of the Common-wealth was ju&s;tly e&s;teemed liable to the Seque&s;tration: dur|ing which time the Pe&s;tilence, the Epidemical di&s;ea&s;e of that &s;ea&s;on at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> affecting with its contagion the Ships company, about eighteen or twenty of them dyed thereof, and all their affairs reduced to a &s;trange con|&s;ternation.</P>
<P>In this interim many and various were the di&s;putes and conte&s;ts between the two Re&s;i|dents; &s;ometimes they propo&s;ed to refer their differences to the deci&s;ion of the Engli&s;h, French, and Venetian Mini&s;ters; &s;ometimes again, find|ing the di&s;tance &s;o wide and &s;patious between them, they re&s;olved to have their matters deter|mined by Turki&s;h Sentence. At length the new Re&s;ident perceiving no end of this bu&s;ine&s;s, and that the Ship lay ingaged at a great charge, and as it were captivated to the great di&s;honour of the Republick, came to an agreement to pay thirty three thou&s;and Dollars, one third where|of was to be paid in hand, and the other two thirds by equal portions in the &s;pace of one year; the fir&s;t payment to be made after &s;ix months, and the other &s;ix months after; to which not only the Re&s;ident, but their Mer|chants al&s;o entred per&s;onally into obligation. In this manner the Ship being cleared, and taking &s;uch Lading as offered for <HI>Genoua</HI> at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> &s;ailed for <HI>Smyrna;</HI> where taking another Ship of the &s;ame Country into her company, departed with the Dutch Convoy for Chri&s;tendom. But hav|ing remained &s;ix months in Port, &s;ubjected to much charge and trouble, and not finding a Freight equal to the time and expence, was no great incouragement to the Genoue&s;es to con|tinue this Trade, which by good experience appears in no manner agreeable to their Coun|try, nor yielding &s;ucce&s;s an&s;werable to the long expectation of ten years pa&s;t.</P>
<P>In this Year it was, that the Grand Signior and Great Vizier at the in&s;tigation of <HI>Chu&s;aein</HI> Aga the chief Cu&s;tomer (whom we have be|fore mentioned) ca&s;ting their eyes on <HI>Smyrna,</HI> and finding it a place of a great Trade, and a convenient Port, for which in ancient times it was always famous, and for the &s;ame cau&s;e was frequented by Merchants both from the Ea&s;tern and We&s;tern parts of the World; &s;o that it was become the only great and con&s;iderable Mart or Scale within the Precincts of the Tur|ki&s;h Empire: con&s;idering it (I &s;ay) in this manner with a benign eye, as bring|ing great profit and advantage, they began to think it worthy the Ornament of &s;ome pub|lick Edifices, founded with that Magnificence as might endure long, and renew the ancient Ho|nour and Reputation of <HI>Smyrna:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Be&s;a|&s;teen and new Cu|&s;tom-hou&s;e, and a Roy|al Chan built at <HI>Smyrna.</HI></NOTE> Hereupon they erected in the fir&s;t place a Be&s;a&s;teen, which is in the nature of our Exchange, where &s;everal Shops are made, and variety of Goods &s;old; and to make the better Front towards the Sea, it was founded therein on va&s;t Stones and Piles, fit to &s;upport a weighty Building.</P>
<P>The next Edifice erected was a Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e built into the Sea only on Piles of Timber, with a hand&s;om Front towards the Sea; and this the Great Vizier judged to be a work not only nece&s;&s;ary, but al&s;o agreeable to the Maje&s;ty of his Ma&s;ter; for until this time the Cu&s;tomer lived in a hired Hou&s;e not unlike the others which Merchants inhabit. And now this Hou&s;e being com|pleated, a Hatte&s;heriff or Royal decree came down from the Court, commanding that all Ships that came into that Port either to lade or unlade, &s;hould lay their &s;ides to that Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e Scale, and thereon di&s;charge their Goods, and receive others.</P>
<P>And now whereas the Merchants injoyed at all times in former days the convenience of ha|ving their Goods landed on, and laden from their own Keys or Scales, they greatly re&s;ented this innovation; and as they unwillingly quit any Priviledge, &s;o they judged this not un|worthy to be contended for with &s;ingular con|&s;tancy and re&s;olution: the commodiou&s;ne&s;s of which was thought &s;o con&s;iderable, that it not only cau&s;ed this place in former days to flou|rish, and to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from all the Marts in the World; but al&s;o the injoyment thereof invited the Inhabitants from the more elevated parts of <HI>Smyrna</HI> (where was health and plea&s;ure) to the lower Bogs and Mari&s;hes, exchang|ing health and chearful air for profit and convenience of Commerce. Hereupon ap|plications were made by all the Con&s;uls of the Frank Nations to their Amba&s;&s;adours and Mini&s;ters at the Grand Signiors Court. In the mean time Trade by common agreement was in|terdicted, at lea&s;t as to the lading or unlading of Ships, which continued for &s;everal days, and touched &s;omewhat grievou&s;ly the Engli&s;h and Dutch Nations: the fir&s;t having two Ships, and the latter &s;ix Merchants-&s;hips in Port. The Engli&s;h Amba&s;&s;adour being then per&s;onally at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> was the fir&s;t who without the a&s;&s;i|&s;tance of any other Mini&s;ter, moved in this affair, but found great oppo&s;ition in it from the Turki&s;h Officers; who with &s;ome re&s;ent|ment of the pre&s;ent reluctancy of the Mer|chants, declared not without pa&s;&s;ion, the re|&s;olution the Grand Signior had to conform the honour of the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e in &s;ome &s;em|blance with tho&s;e of Chri&s;tian Princes; and therefore did wonder that the Chri&s;tian Mer|chants could &s;o ea&s;ily conde&s;cend to the rules of tho&s;e Cu&s;tom hou&s;es in their own Countries, where they were Natives, and yet could not &s;upport the &s;ame in the&s;e parts where they were Aliens and Strangers. And as a farther evidence of the Turks re&s;olution to maintain this point, it was &s;aid by the Vizier's Kahya, that the Grand Signior was re&s;olved to blow up both Port and Town, rather than not be obey|ed in his own Dominions; with this An&s;wer, Merchants de&s;pairing of the &s;ucce&s;s, began to unlade their &s;hips at the Cu&s;tom hou&s;e, or to give an account there of the Goods in their Boats; for the Cu&s;tomer was become &s;en&s;ible, there was not &s;ufficient Water for &s;hips to ride at the Key of the Cu&s;tom hou&s;e, and did al&s;o indulge unto the Merchants &s;everal other particulars herein, that &s;o the innovation might &s;it the more lightly on them, which he per|ceived was &s;o ill re&s;ented and taken to heart. And this was the fir&s;t beginning in the Months of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> and <HI>September,</HI> when this priviledge was taken from the Merchants. And in this Year al&s;o the Great Chan next to the Be&s;a&s;teen was in Building, and the fir&s;t Foundation thereof laid, and the great Aqua|duct brought from the Plains of <HI>Bogiaw,</HI> and lit|tle <HI>Harchi-bonar.</HI></P>

But now the News of the de&s;igned return of the Grand Sig|nior to his ancient Seat, filled all places with joy and triumph, e&s;pecialy at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> which was not more &s;atisfied with the con&s;ideration of the benefit and advantage it was likely to re|ceive by the Royal Pre&s;ence, than that tho&s;e &s;u&s;picions and jealou&s;ies which formerly po&s;&s;e&s;|ed the mind of the Sultan with a prejudice a|gain&s;t this place, did &s;eem now to vani&s;h, and that he rea&s;&s;umed a confidence of his Roy|al City equal to that love and e&s;teem which his Ance&s;tors had of it; &s;o that the humour which then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> ap|peared like that of <HI>London</HI> at our Kings Re|&s;tauration, all joy, even to tran&s;port, for this unexpected Return; the people in the &s;treets congratulating their mutual happine&s;s, thanked God, that they had lived to &s;ee that happy day and ble&s;&s;ed hour.</P>
<P>The occa&s;ion of this unexpected and &s;udden re&s;olution cau&s;ed many roving gue&s;&s;es and opi|nations of the rea&s;ons of it. Some &s;aid a Dream which the Grand Signior had, and which gave great di&s;turbance to his thoughts, until he re&s;ol|ved for <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> Others &s;aid, the revolt and troubles at <HI>Cairo,</HI> of which we &s;hall pre|&s;ently have occa&s;ion to di&s;cour&s;e, and &s;ome added certain Commotions at <HI>Bagdat,</HI> or <HI>Baby|lon;</HI> &s;ome reported, that <HI>Xeriff</HI> of <HI>Mecha</HI> wrote him a Letter, that he could not acknowledge him the Head and Protector of the Mu&s;&s;ulmin Faith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conjectures concerning the rea&s;ons of the Grand Sig|niors re|turn to <HI>Con&s;tan|tinople.</HI></NOTE> &s;o long as he had abandoned his Imperi|al City, and lived in the mountains and un|known places. Others &s;aid, that the Jani&s;aries and Militia murmured, and that his Coming to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> was forced and not to be avoid|ed; and that the Sultan being now out of love with <HI>Adrianople,</HI> had cur&s;ed it, and &s;worn never more to &s;et foot in it, having ordered the ma|terials &s;ent for the building of the Great Sera|glio at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> to be &s;topped on the way, and returned back again. At this rate all the World talked and di&s;cour&s;ed, joy and hopes made the people fancy every thing according to their wi&s;hes. The Grand Signior being approach|ed near to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> fixed him&s;elf in his Camp in the Fields, near a &s;mall Seraglio of his own, called <HI>Daout Ba&s;ha,</HI> from whence the people for many days expected, that he &s;hould, according to the Cu&s;tom of his Ance&s;tors, make a &s;olemn Entry; in&s;tead whereof he made &s;ome Salies with a &s;mall Company through the Streets, as it were <HI>incognito,</HI> taking his pa&s;time on the Water, and on the &s;ides of the <HI>Bo&s;phorus</HI> in his Gallies and Boats, but mo&s;t commonly frequented his Place of <HI>Scutari</HI> on the A&s;ian &s;ide, where with much delight and confidence he lodged and repo&s;ed his Court, but made no &s;olemn Entry through the City, not frequented his great Seraglio; where though he might perhaps dine, and pa&s;s certain hours, yet he &s;lept not one Night there; of which the people took e&s;pecial notice, and thereby received con|firmation of the jealou&s;ie their Soveraign had of them, to their extraordinary grief and di&s;|&s;atisfaction; however it was &s;ome contentment to the people, and renown unto the City to have their Emperour &s;o near, though it was rumoured as if the Court towards the approach of Winter intended again to return unto <HI>Adri|anople.</HI> In the mean time the Grand Signior took his chief delight and diverti&s;ement on the Water, pa&s;&s;ing in his Gallies and Plea&s;ure-Boats up the <HI>Bo&s;phorus</HI> to the mouth of the Black Sea; and thence returning, much frequented the Gar|dens, and Hou&s;es of Delight upon the Banks of the River; and vi&s;iting all places, a Country Hou&s;e called <HI>Therapea,</HI> belonging to the Dutch Re&s;ident, received the honour of his Pre&s;ence, which he liked &s;o well, that he took it from the Proprietor, and conferred it without any con&s;ideration of money onone of his Courtiers, giving out a Proclamation, That no Chri&s;tian Mini&s;ter &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s any Seat or Habitation on the &s;ide of the <HI>Bo&s;phorus,</HI> A &s;trange thing, and what is not to be paralleled in any part of the World.</P>
<P>About the beginning of this Year the Captain Pa&s;ha died, and <HI>Zaid Ahmet</HI> Pa&s;h-ogli, then at the Camp, &s;ucceeded him; his Father was a famous Man, and in the &s;ame Charge, but cut off by old <HI>Kuperlee.</HI> Soon after <HI>Ibrahim</HI> Pa&s;ha, General of the Army at <HI>Keminitz,</HI> likewi&s;e died, and his Office was conferred on <HI>Ibrahim Pa&s;ha,</HI> that was Pa&s;ha of <HI>Candia,</HI> of whom we have had often occa&s;ion to &s;peak, being a great friend to the Engli&s;h Nation. The Great Vizier al&s;o was not far remote from the Confines of Death, being now fallen, by rea&s;on of immoderate drinking of Wine, and chiefly of hot Cina|mon Waters, into a formed Drop&s;ie and Jaundice.</P>
<PB N="259" REF="132">
<P>In the preceding year we touched on the re|moval of the Tefterdar or Trea&s;urer from his Office to the Government of Grand <HI>Cairo,</HI> and the rea&s;ons for it, which though it might be a preferment (being the riche&s;t and mo&s;t im|portant Charge of the Empire) to which the e&s;teem the Sultan had of his parts and abilites, might probably advance him; yet the imploy|ing of him at a di&s;tance &s;o remote, was certain|ly an effect of &s;ome di&s;plea&s;ure, whereby he or his Favourites judged him a Per&s;on not fit to remain longer near the Royal Pre&s;ence. Where|fore having commenced his Journey (as before mentioned) he arrived at Grand <HI>Cairo,</HI> where he had not long continued before he began, ac|cording to the natural acutene&s;s of his mind and hug&s;tering manner, to pierce with a narrow in&s;pection into all Affairs of that Government, and particularly into the Revenue and Trea&s;ure of the Country, contriving with him&s;elf by what means the di&s;orders might be corrected, and the Revenue and Tribute improved; for he had an excellent Genius or Spirit in the matters of Money, nothing in advantage of In|tere&s;t could ever e&s;cape him; &s;o that he began to lay a new foundation in all proceedings; he would not be contented with the old Taxes and Impo&s;itions, and where he found Lands im|proved, or the Cu&s;toms augmented, he would put in for a &s;hare of the Benefits, and would reform every thing wherein he judged his Ma|&s;ter to have been abu&s;ed. But though he was acute and &s;harp-&s;ighted in &s;uch matters as the&s;e, yet he wanted experience in the Government of <HI>Egypt;</HI> for the&s;e great Beghs of this Country being alarmed with the innovations, began to &s;tand upon their Guard, and to enter into pri|vate Con&s;ultations, in what manner to oppo&s;e them&s;elves to this new way of Government, which looked like &s;lavery, and de&s;igns of bringing them into &s;ervitude, and a &s;ubjection unknown to them and their Fore-fathers. For indeed the Government of <HI>Egypt,</HI> if well con|&s;idered, is rather Ari&s;tocratical than Monar|chical; for though they acknowledge the Sul|tan to be their Head, and accept his Pa&s;ha for Ruler, and pay a yearly Tribute, yet the Beghs which are great Lords in their re&s;pective Coun|tries, carry the &s;way and Dominion in all other matters, and will endure nothing with favours of oppre&s;&s;ion or innovation; &s;o that the&s;e per|&s;ons grown jealous by the proceedings of the new Pa&s;ha, flew into open Sedition, and im|mediately to Arms, with force of which they a&s;&s;aulted the Pa&s;ha's Palace, took him and threw him into Pri&s;on. The News whereof flying with all ha&s;te to the Ottoman Court, ap|peared at the fir&s;t apprehen&s;ion or &s;urpri&s;e as if all <HI>Egypt</HI> had revolted, and gave the World occa&s;ion to di&s;cour&s;e, That the Wars were to be carried Ea&s;tward, and that the &s;udden re&s;o|lution of removing the Court to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> was in order to a farther March into tho&s;e parts. But frequent Me&s;&s;ages with time making the bu&s;ine&s;s to be better under&s;tood, cau&s;ed the Grand Signior to di&s;peed with all ha&s;te another Pa&s;ha, with Commi&s;&s;ion to remove the former, and to continue all the ancient Cu&s;toms and Priviledges from the beginning indulged to the Beghs of <HI>Egypt:</HI> with which Me&s;&s;age and gentle words of grace and favour from the Sultan, all di&s;contents being pacified, the former Pa&s;ha was relea&s;ed from his Impri&s;onment, and &s;uf|fered to depart, and thence proce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ed to the I&s;land of <HI>Candia,</HI> where he entred on that Pa|&s;haluck, &s;ucceeding <HI>Ibrahim</HI> Pa&s;ha in Charge, who (as before related) was &s;ent to <HI>Kemenitz</HI> to be General of the Army, in place of the Pa&s;ha lately decea&s;ed.</P>
<P>But here I mu&s;t not forget a &s;tory which hap|pened during the time of this Summer, whil&s;t the Grand Signior had his abode and injoyed his Recreations in the circumjacent parts of <HI>Con|&s;tantinople;</HI> there was a certain Sultana which had been a ca&s;t Wench of Sultan <HI>Ibrahim,</HI> who after his death, having been married to &s;ome Pa&s;ha, obtained her relea&s;e from the old Serag|lio, and being al&s;o a Widow by the death of this Husband, had liberty to take her habitation on the Banks of the <HI>Bo&s;phorus,</HI> or where &s;he thought fit. This Lady was called <HI>Soltana Sporcha,</HI> in Turki&s;h <HI>Modar:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Hi|&s;tory of <HI>Soltana Sporcha.</HI></NOTE> how &s;he came to be &s;o nominated I cannot tell, perhaps &s;ome Italian Pages of the Court might in re&s;pect to her way of living impo&s;e this Name upon her, for &s;he was no other than a Bawd, or &s;omething wor&s;e, making it her Profe&s;&s;ion to buy young Girls, and to educate them in &s;inging, dancing and in all the ways which be&s;t accompli&s;h Courti&s;ans. Among&s;t this Train of Scholars, &s;he had one more brisk and aery than the o|thers, which could &s;ing, and dance, and prate in|comparably, and was &s;o quick in her Repar|ties, that &s;he greatly delighted the Pa&s;ha's and Lords, who&s;e plea&s;ures &s;he atended, bringing from them con&s;iderable Gifts and Pre&s;ents to the enriching of her &s;elf and Mi&s;tre&s;s; and be|came &s;o much the talk of the Court, that at length the report of her arrived the cars of the Grand Signior, who being al&s;o de&s;irous to injoy &s;ome diverti&s;ements by the pranks of this witty Girl, &s;ent to the Sultana one of the black Eu|nuchs for her: which Imperial Command &s;he not daring to di&s;obey, con&s;igned her with great &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion into the hands of the Me&s;&s;enger; but with this caution, that &s;he humbly de&s;ired the Sultan not to make any attempt on her Cha&s;tity, in regard &s;he was both a Virgin and Free-wo|man. The grand Signior having plea&s;ed him|&s;elf with the wantonne&s;s of this Wench, began to take a fancy to her, and re&s;olved to take her into the Seraglio; but &s;he &s;hewing a kind of nicety and coine&s;s, the Grand Signior, who per|haps was better accommodated, &s;ent her back a|gain to her Mi&s;tre&s;s, reflecting (as was &s;uppo&s;ed) with &s;ome di&s;gu&s;t on the caution which accom|panied her. It happened not long after, that this Girl exerci&s;ing her Art in the pre&s;ence of &s;ome great Per&s;ons, one <HI>Che&s;m&eacute;</HI> Aga, a Bo&s;nian by Nation, Captain of the Great Vi&s;iers Guard, a &s;tout and valiant man, happening to be a Spectator one night, became unfortunately en|amoured of her, and from that time not being able to remove the impre&s;&s;ion &s;he had made in his heart, re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to make her his Wife, and to that end made his affections known and his intentions of Marriage, both to her and to her Mi&s;tre&s;s. The Girl was well enough plea&s;ed to become the Wife of &s;o honourable a Per&s;on; but the Sultana unwilling to lo&s;e the profit and benefit &s;he daily brought her in, re|fu&s;ed the Match, declaring, That &s;he was a Slave, and not at her own di&s;po&s;al, and there|fore in no capacity of be&s;towing her &s;elf any way without her con&s;ent. This impediment giving a &s;top to the Marriage, put the two Lovers on plots and contrivances in what manner to injoy each other, and Love being ingenious, quickly
<PB N="262" REF="133">found out a means to bring them together; for the Girl e&s;caping from her Mi&s;tre&s;s, lodged her &s;elf in tho&s;e Chambers which her Lover had found for her. And being now mi&s;&s;ed, none but <HI>Che&s;m&eacute;</HI> Aga was charged with her, of whom &s;he complained to the Grand Signior, and cited him before his Ma&s;ter the Great Vizier to an|&s;wer for her; but he denying to know any thing of her, and no witne&s;s appearing again&s;t him, all farther proceedings were &s;uper&s;eded for the pre&s;ent: But <HI>Soltana Sporcha</HI> keeping watchful &s;pies upon all the motions of <HI>Che&s;m&eacute;</HI> Aga, at length found him and his Mi&s;tre&s;s to|gether, and by the Authority of Officers brought them both before the Vizier: to whom the Sultana &s;ent a rude me&s;&s;age, That <HI>Che&s;me</HI> Aga &s;hould be puni&s;hed, and that her Slave &s;hould be returned. The Vi&s;ier hereof acquainted the Grand Signior, and gave him to under&s;tand the me&s;&s;age which the Sultana had &s;ent him, de&s;i|ring to know what puni&s;hment he was plea&s;ed &s;hould be inflicted on them. In which interrim <HI>Che&s;m&eacute;</HI> Aga told the Vi&s;ier, That he ex|pected no other than a &s;entence of death from the Grand Signior, only he de&s;ired that his be|loved Mi&s;tre&s;s might be &s;pared, for he was &s;ure he &s;hould live in her. It was not long before the fatal Decree came for putting <HI>Che&s;m&eacute;</HI> Aga to death, and &s;ending the Woman to the Seraglio, which was immediately executed; which act might &s;eem to denote a natural cruelty in the Sultan, being in reality very &s;evere, though the whole cour&s;e of his Reign hath been more gentle and mild than of any of the Ottoman Emperours; only this fact proceeded rather from di&s;dain than thir&s;t of blood, being angry that this Girl &s;hould prefer the Love of one of his Va&s;&s;als before the Ho|nours of the Seraglio, and that her Mi&s;tre&s;s the Sultana &s;hould charm him with a lye of her being free, when &s;he was no other than a &s;lave, and not long before bought for an incon&s;iderable price.</P>
<P>Not long after this, and towards the <HI>11th,</HI> or <HI>12th,</HI> of <HI>September,</HI> when the Sun was come to the Equinoctial, the Grand Signior prepared to depart.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Grand Signior re|turns again to <HI>Adri|anople.</HI></NOTE> The rumour of which di&s;plea&s;ing and making &s;ad the people hearts, as much as his pre&s;ence before comforted them, it was given out, That the Grand Signior intended to return with the Spring, and divide the con&s;olation, which his re&s;idence produced, between the two Regal Cities, and for an evidence thereof, he ordered a Platform to be laid for erecting a new Seraglio at <HI>Scutari,</HI> and the Vi&s;ier de&s;igned a|nother at <HI>Bezick-ra&s;h,</HI> and the Palaces of the Pa&s;ha's and great Men were all putting into a way of Reparation, which for &s;ome time amu|&s;ed and contented the minds of the Common|alty.</P>
<P>About the beginning of <HI>October</HI> the Grand Signior &s;et forward towards <HI>Adrianople,</HI> being accompanied with the Mo&s;ayp, which is his Favourite, and <HI>Kara Mu&s;tapha</HI> who was his Chimacam, taking his recreation by the way in Hunting; but the Great Vizier <HI>Achmet</HI> Pa&s;ha continuing &s;till &s;ick of his Drop&s;ie and Jaundice, took his Journey by Water as far as <HI>Selebra</HI> for his better ea&s;e, and thence proceed|ing in a Hor&s;e litter to <HI>Churlu,</HI> which is the half-way to <HI>Adrianople,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Death of the Vizier <HI>Achmet.</HI></NOTE> on the twenty third of <HI>October</HI> expired his la&s;t; his Di&s;ca&s;e, though heightned by Wine and hot Spirits, yet was in &s;ome part hereditary, his father dying of the Drop&s;ie. His Body was on the twenty fifth brought back again in a Coach to <HI>Con|&s;tantinople</HI> with a &s;mall Attendance, and buried in the &s;ame Sepulchre with his Father. He was a Per&s;on (for I have &s;een him often,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Cha|racter.</NOTE> and knew him well) of a midle &s;tature, of a black beard, and brown complexion, &s;omething &s;hort-&s;ighted, which cau&s;ed him to knit his brows and pore very intently when any &s;trange per&s;on entred to his pre&s;ence: he was inclining to be fat, and grew corpulent towards his latter days. If we con&s;ider his age when he fir&s;t took upon him this important Charge, the Enemies his Father had created him, the contentions he had with the <HI>Valede Sultana</HI> or the Queen-Mother, and the Arts he had u&s;ed to reconcile the affections of the&s;e great Per&s;o|nages, and con&s;erve him&s;elf in the unalterable e&s;teem of his Soveraign to the la&s;t hour of his death, there is none but mu&s;t judge him to have de&s;erved the Character of a prudent and politick Per&s;on. If we con&s;ider how few were put to death, and what incon&s;iderable Muti|nies or Rebellions happened in any part of the Empire during his Government, it will afford us a clear evidence and proof of his gentlene&s;s and moderation beyond the example of former times; for certainly he was not a Per&s;on who delighted in bloud, and in that re&s;pect of an humor far different from the temper of his Father; He was generous, and free from A|varice, a rare Vertue in a Turk! He was educated in the Law, and therefore greatly ad|dicted to all the Formalities of it, and in the Admini&s;tration of that &s;ort of Ju&s;tice very pun|ctual and &s;evere; He was very ob&s;ervant of the Capitulations between our King and the Grand Signior, being ready to do Ju&s;tice upon any corrupt Mini&s;ter, who pertinaciou&s;ly viola|ted and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed them, of which I could give &s;everal in&s;tances, but the&s;e being improper for this place, are only in general to be men|tioned with due gratitude in honour to his Me|mory. As to his behaviour towards the neighbouring Princes, there may, I believe, be fewer examples of his breach of Faith, than what his Predece&s;&s;ors have given in a &s;horter time of Rule. In his Wars abroad he was &s;ucce&s;sful, having upon every expedition enlarged the Bounds of the Empire; He over|came <HI>Newhaw&s;el</HI> or <HI>Oywar,</HI> and laid thereunto a con&s;iderable part of <HI>Hungary,</HI> which to this day continues &s;ubject, and pays contribution to the Turk.</P>
<P>He concluded the War with <HI>Venice</HI> after twenty &s;even years continuance, by an intire and total &s;ubjection of the I&s;land of <HI>Candia,</HI> having &s;ubdued that impregnable Fortre&s;s, which by the re&s;t of the World was e&s;teemed invincible.</P>
<P>He won <HI>Kemenitz,</HI> the Key of <HI>Poland,</HI> where the Turks had been frequently baffled, and laid <HI>&V;krania</HI> to the Empire; reducing the Co&s;acks, tho&s;e mortal Enemies, to &s;ubjection, and to a de&s;ire of taking on them the Otto|man Yoke: and finally, he impo&s;ed a new Tribute on all <HI>Poland.</HI> After all which Glories he dyed in the <HI>47th</HI> year of his Age, and <HI>15th</HI> year and <HI>8th</HI> day of his Government; a &s;hort time, if we con&s;ider it, for &s;uch great actions; how&s;oever, if we mea&s;ure his triumphs, rather than count his years though he might &s;eem to have lived but little to his Prince and People, yet certainly to him&s;elf he could not dye more &s;ea&s;onable, nor in a greater height and emi|nency

<P>The Great Vizier having in this manner ex|pired his la&s;t breath, the Seal was immediately carried by his Brother to the Grand Signior, who upon Receipt thereof, according to com|mon expectation, conferred the &s;ame on <HI>Kara Mu&s;tapha</HI> Pa&s;ha, who had for &s;o many years formerly exerci&s;ed the Office of Chimacam,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kara Mu|&s;tapha <HI>made Vizi|er.</HI></NOTE> which is as much as Deputy to the Great Vizier, of whom in other places we gave a Character of being a wi&s;e and experienced Per&s;on, of a &s;mooth behaviour, and a great Courtier; agreeable to which temper of mind, &s;o &s;oon as he attained this promotion, he &s;ent an obliging and courteous Me&s;&s;age to the Ser|vants of the decea&s;ed Vizier, condoling with them the death of their Ma&s;ter, promi&s;ing to take them and their Concernments into his Care and Protection; according whereunto he advanced <HI>Solyman</HI> Kahya (who was the late Vizier's Sub&s;titute,) and for &s;ome years had managed all Affairs to the Office of Embra|hore, which is chief Ma&s;ter of the Grand Sig|niors hor&s;e, and is a place not only of honour, but of great &s;ecurity. He that was his own Kahya he made a Vizier of the Bench, and Chimacam in the &s;ame manner as he was to <HI>Achmet</HI> Vizier; by which point of policy he &s;eemed to have &s;trengthened him&s;elf again&s;t all Enemies, for having two Creatures of his own &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed; one near the Per&s;on of his Prince, who would be able to do him all good Offices; and the other (when&s;oever the Wars or other occa&s;ions &s;hould cau&s;e him to be ab&s;ent from the Royal Pre&s;ence) might &s;upply his place without attempting to &s;upplant him. The Kapi&s;ler-Kahya&s;ee, or Ma&s;ter of the Ceremonies to the late Vizier, he made his own Kahya, and all the other Agas which de|pended on that Court, he received into his own &s;ervice; &s;o that in effect there &s;eemed, by this great chance of Mortality, to be little other al|teration in the Court, than of the &s;ingle per&s;on of the decea&s;ed Vizier; of who&s;e Memory, that the Grand Signior might evidence the love and e&s;teem that he retained, he did not inter|meddle or appropriate unto him&s;elf any part of his E&s;tate, or di&s;anulled his Te&s;tament; but re&s;igned all into the hands of his Relations, challenging no &s;hare or proportion thereof: And whereas the Vizier le&s;t no Children, the E&s;tate fell to his Brother and Si&s;ters, who to evidence their Devotion to Religion, and good will to the Publick, and to plea&s;e the eyes of the envious World, conferred on <HI>Mecha</HI> the Rent of the new Cu&s;tom hou&s;e, the Be&s;a&s;teen, and new Chan built at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> and fini&s;hed in the year 1677.</P>
<P>At this fir&s;t change there were rumors that the new Vizier had begun his Government in blood, having cut off &s;everal heads lately in Au|thority; but all was fal&s;e, and only grounded on a di&s;plea&s;ure which he was known to have con|ceived again&s;t certain per&s;ons. Only one act he performed rather of ju&s;tice than &s;everity, having cut off one of the Pay-ma&s;ters of the Exchequer for fal&s;e Money. The occa&s;ion was this: Certain Muletiers having received mony from the Exchequer in Venetian Ze|chins, and finding &s;everal of them fal&s;e, re|turned them again, but could not previal to have them changed; whereupon having made their Memorial thereof, they carried them to the Vizier, and upon examination, the Pay|ma&s;ter declared, That he received them from the Great <HI>Ibrahim</HI> Han-ogli, who being for that Cau&s;e &s;ent for and accu&s;ed, was put into a fear, which proved as dangerous to him as a Di&s;ea&s;e, the apprehen&s;ions of Death being wor&s;e than the reality; but the Great Tefterdar &s;oon cleared him of this Accu&s;ation, having atte&s;ted, That to his knowledge the mony re|ceived from him was good, and di&s;po&s;ed on other occa&s;ions; &s;o that the whole blame ly|ing now on the Pay-ma&s;ter, and upon farther &s;earch more of the &s;ame &s;tamp being found in his hands, he de&s;ervedly &s;uffered the puni&s;h|ment of Death, the which had likewi&s;e been inflicted on another Officer of the &s;ame rank, but not being found &s;o culpable as the other, he was permitted to redeem his life with forty Pur&s;es of Mony, or twenty thou&s;and Dollars.</P>
<P>Thus far we have &s;een the gentle and &s;mooth behaviour of the pre&s;ent Vizier towards the Friends, Relations, and Servants of the De|cea&s;ed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aherati|ens with the new Vizier.</NOTE> and with what Acts of Ju&s;tice he began his Government. But, behold, on a &s;udden the face of the whole Court was changed, every Officer thereof putting on a Countenance of fiercene&s;s, pride, and arrogance, beyond the manner and cu&s;tom lately practi&s;ed. For the Great Vi&s;ier took on him&s;elf the State and Grandeur of the Sultan, (the acce&s;s being as difficult to him as to his Ma&s;ter) his Kahya that of the Vi&s;ier, and &s;o every inferior Officer advanced him&s;elf into a fancy of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the next and immediate Degree above him. This haughty behaviour had a more particular in|fluence on the Mini&s;ters and Repre&s;entatives of Foreign Princes, who&s;e Interpreters were not admitted, as formerly, to private Audiences or Conferences about their Affairs, but only at the Publick Divan, where their Arzes or Memorials were to be preferred in the &s;ame manner as was practi&s;ed by the Subjects of the Country, and tho&s;e of conquered Nations, who petition for Ju&s;tice. The which aba&s;e|ment was not only ca&s;t on the Interpreters, but on the Per&s;ons of the Repre&s;entatives them|&s;elves: an example of which we have in the French Amba&s;&s;ador; who coming at the time appointed to receive his Audience of the Vi&s;ier, was forced to expect a long time before he could have admittance, and then entering into the Chamber of Audience, was rudely crouded, and ru&s;hed upon by a Crew of unmannerly Chaou&s;es, who no otherwi&s;e regarded the Per|&s;on of the Amba&s;&s;ador, than if he had been one of the Grooms or Lacquies. Being come to the Seat of Audience, the Amba&s;lador ob|&s;erved, That the Stool for the Great Vi&s;ier was &s;et upon the Soffr&aacute;, and that for Him be|low, or at the foot of it; the which being an unu&s;ual and unpracti&s;ed diminution of the ancient honour given formerly to Amba&s;&s;adors, he ordered one of his Servants, To &s;et it again on the Soffr&aacute; equal with that of the Vi&s;ier's; the which being done, was again brought down by one of the Vi&s;iers Pa|ges, and placed as before; whereupon, the Amba&s;&s;ador &s;eizing the Stool with his own hand, carried it on the Sofft&aacute;, and &s;ate upon it; which being reported to the Vi&s;ier, then in his retiring Chamber, he &s;ent twice to him to re|move, letting him know, That unle&s;s the Stool were returned into the Place appointed by him,
<PB N="262" REF="134">he would not appear in the Chamber of Au|dience. Whereunto his Excellency returned this prudent An&s;wer, That the Vi&s;ier might di&s;po&s;e of his Chair as he plea&s;ed, but not of his Per&s;on. In which Interim the Chaou&s;-Ba&s;hee came in, roaring out, <HI>Calder, Calder,</HI> which is, Take it away, Take it away, (mean|ing the Stool) at which noi&s;e the Amba&s;&s;ador ari&s;ing to &s;ee what the matter was, had the Stool taken from under him; whereat being greatly enraged, he threw out of the Room in a high pa&s;&s;ion, and cau&s;ing the Pre&s;ents which he brought to be again returned with him, he mounted his Hor&s;e, and de|parted.</P>
<P>Afterwards it was intimated unto the Eng|li&s;h Amba&s;&s;ador, That he might, if he plea&s;ed, receive Audience of the Great Vifier; But his Excellency, uuder&s;tanding in what manner the French Amba&s;&s;ador had been treated, ex|cu&s;ed his going, on pretence of an Indi&s;po&s;ition of health. How&s;oever, the <HI>Venetian</HI> Bailo, and the Re&s;idents of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Genoua</HI> were con|tented to be admitted unto Audience on tho&s;e terms which the Vi&s;ier was plea&s;ed to allow. And though during the time that he was Chi|macam, and bore other inferior Offices, and Charges of Tru&s;t, his behaviour was gentle, affable, and civil; yet I fear, that now having changed his Office, he will have altered his humour, and that his Greatne&s;s will have en-crea&s;ed his Pride, Avarice, and Fiercene&s;s: thus, no man knows what another will be, when he &s;hall enter into power.</P>
<Q>Dic mihi &s;i fueris tu Leo, qualis eris.</Q>
<P>And as <HI>Magi&s;tratus indicat Virum,</HI> &s;o in the actions of his management the temper and con|&s;titution of this great Per&s;on will be di&s;covered. And thus having given a &s;hort Account and Character of this pre&s;ent Vi&s;ier, his future Acts and Monuments mu&s;t be the Subject of other Pens.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE TURKISH EMPIRE CONTINUED, From the Year of Our Lord, 1676, to the Year 1686.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By Sir <HI>Roger Manley,</HI> Knight.</BYLINE>
<P>THE Hi&s;tory of the Turki&s;h Em|pire, having been transferr'd to us by Mr. <HI>Knolles</HI> very methodi|cally and well, and continued by the deferving Pen of Sir <HI>Paul Ry|caut,</HI> to the Year 1676, being the Twenty eighth of <HI>Sultan Mahomet</HI> the Fourth, now reigning: We have, as well by inclinati|on, as to &s;atisfie the de&s;ires of &s;ome Friends, thought fit to pro&s;ecute &s;o laudable a De&s;ign, by extending the Hi&s;tory of that great Monarchy to our pre&s;ent Times. And though we may be defective in skill for &s;o Eminent an Underta|king, we &s;hall notwith&s;tanding add Indu&s;try to our Endeavours, and compen&s;ate our Failings by the candour and ingenuity of our Narra|tive.</P>
<P><HI>Achmet,</HI> the great <HI>Vi&s;ier,</HI> being dead in his way to <HI>Adrianople,</HI> was &s;ucceeded by <HI>Kara Mu&s;tapha,</HI> his Brother-in-Law, aged about fifty, and who had exerci&s;ed the office of <HI>Caimacan</HI> for many years. The Grand Seignior, to indear him the more to him, married him to one of his Daugh|ters, though very young, not exceeding five years of age, according to the cu&s;tom practi&s;ed by the <HI>Sultans,</HI> to be rid of their Daughters be|times, which are always numerous, by rea&s;on of the multiplicity of their Concubines, and by this means to ea&s;e them&s;elves of the Expence which they are obliged to be at in maintaining them according to their Quality.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame Month of <HI>January,</HI> the &s;trong Ga|ri&s;on of <HI>Cani&s;ia,</HI> having drawn out a Party to attack the I&s;le of <HI>Sexin,</HI> allarmed all <HI>Croatia,</HI> by their Military Executions exacting Contributi|ons, and pillaging and burning &s;uch places as did not &s;ubmit to their tyranny. The Turks of <HI>Newhau&s;el</HI> did al&s;o ravage the Countrey on their &s;ide as far as <HI>Fry&s;tat.</HI> But before we enter upon their &s;tage of War, it may be requi&s;ite to &s;ay &s;omewhat of the Troubles of <HI>Hungary</HI> which preceded, and their cau&s;es, and how the Infidels came to be Principals in a War of Religion be|tween Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>The Kingdom of <HI>Hungary,</HI> being &s;ubdivided into Counties, as in <HI>England,</HI> or Communities, have right to &s;end their Deputies to the Dyets or Conventions of the E&s;tates, which ought to be &s;ummoned every three years, according to the Laws of the Kingdom. This A&s;&s;embly is compo&s;ed of the Clergy, the principal Lords, the Gentry, and the &s;aid Deputies of the Coun|ties. It hath the right of choo&s;ing a Palatine, who ought to be an <HI>Hungarian</HI> according to the priviledges of the Nation, and to have the in|tire direction of War and Ju&s;tice. The great Lords have &s;o great Authority over their Va&s;|&s;als, that they are look'd upon as &s;o many le&s;&s;er Sovereigns in their &s;everal Territories. They have al&s;o great Revenues, which inables them upon occa&s;ion to rai&s;e con&s;iderable Bodies of Men, the People in general being &s;trong, active, and valiant, but covetous, vindicative, and in|con&s;tant.</P>
<P>The great Employments of the Kingdom were al&s;o inve&s;ted in the Natives, and no Stran|gers were to be impo&s;ed upon them, or Foreign|ers enquartered among&s;t them; all which the Emperour, upon his Election to the Crown, was obliged to ob&s;erve by the &s;olemnity of an Oath. But on the other &s;ide, there being very many <HI>Arrians, Calvini&s;ts,</HI> and <HI>Lutherans</HI> in the Countrey, they added to the aver&s;ion the Natives have to the <HI>Germans,</HI> having been, as they thought, too &s;everely u&s;ed by them; complaining, that they were hindred in the free Exerci&s;e of their Reli|gion, their Churches violently taken away from them, and their Mini&s;ters forced from their Duty. It was farther complained, that the Grandees of the Kingdom were not permitted to injoy their Priviledges, of which one was, <HI>That none of them &s;hould for any Crime what&s;oever be con|vened before any Judges but tho&s;e of their own Nation.</HI></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all this, as the Emperour had &s;worn to maintain their Priviledges, he had likewi&s;e promi&s;ed to derend their Country, which could not be done again&s;t the In&s;ults of &s;o powerful an Enemy as the Turk, without an Army; and tho&s;e &s;trangers living ill with the Inhabitants, and they again &s;hutting their Towns again&s;t them, occa&s;ioned infinite Violences and Di&s;orders on both &s;ides, which Repugnancy was the &s;ource of all the Troubles in <HI>Hungary.</HI></P>
<P>The Emperour, beginning to &s;u&s;pect the fide|lity of the <HI>Hungarians,</HI> by rea&s;on of the ob&s;tinacy wherewith they refu&s;ed to lodge his Troops, began &s;eriou&s;ly to think of &s;ecuring the King|dom to him&s;elf, which being perceived, he aug|mented
<PB N="278" REF="136">by that Precaution the hatred which the Nation had conceived again&s;t him; which was re-doubled by the refu&s;al of his Generals to withdraw their Troops out of their Fortre&s;&s;es. The&s;e Grievances did &s;o far agitate the&s;e Spi|rits, already jealous and diffident, that they at length re&s;olved to &s;hake off a Yoke that &s;eem|ed &s;o in&s;upportable. Many great Lords by their particular Intere&s;t were glad to entertain this aver&s;ion, which might &s;erve for the Execu|tion of the De&s;igns they had already formed. And thus the Spirit of revolting did in&s;en&s;ibly diffu&s;e it &s;elf through the whole Kingdom, and the general aver&s;ion grew to that height, that they of the Religion &s;aid openly, that they would rather live under the Domination of the <HI>Turks</HI> than the Tyranny of the <HI>Germans,</HI> whil&s;t one of their Preachers did dare maliciou&s;ly to in&s;inuate, <HI>That the&s;e Infidels would at lea&s;t grant them the liberty of their Religion; whil&s;t the</HI> Dutch <HI>would rack their Con&s;ciences, under pretence of reform|ing them.</HI></P>
<P>The Emperour being informed of the&s;e mur|murings, thought it expedient to &s;ecure the <HI>Lower Hungary,</HI> and &s;o &s;trangle the Rebellion in its birth. Their reiterated pre&s;&s;ing to have the German Troops removed out of the Kingdom, gave him ju&s;t cau&s;e of jealou&s;ie: and be&s;ides, he would not lo&s;e the expence of all his toyls, and tho&s;e va&s;t charges he had been at in forti|fying the Frontier places, and entertaining Ar|mies capable to oppo&s;e the Inva&s;ions of the Turks. Finally, he judged it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;a|ry, to reduce a Nation to their duty, that glo|ried in their di&s;obedience to his Orders: being a King is no farther a Sovereign, than whil&s;t he obliges his Subjects to pay obedience to the Laws, and his Commands.</P>
<P>And thus in &s;hort we have &s;hewed the cau&s;e of this Revolt (which yet la&s;t) on both &s;ides, and though perhaps this digre&s;&s;ion may &s;eem foreign to &s;ome, yet, being the Turks have been &s;o mainly concerned as to become Parties in it, we thought it rea&s;onable to &s;ubjoyn it to their Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>And now to come nearer to the matter in hand, we will &s;ay &s;omewhat of the Maxims of the&s;e Infidels, which will give us &s;ome light in|to their Policies; And fir&s;t, it is a fundamental one to keep their Men perpetually imployed; for Idlene&s;s ingenders indige&s;ted Humours in the Politick, as well as the Natural Body, which renders it infirm. Another Maxim is, that they do never imploy their Forces more than in one War at one time, unle&s;s again&s;t weak Princes; Nor do they de&s;ire to continue long in Arms again&s;t the &s;ame Enemy, unle&s;s con&s;trained by their con&s;tancy, to the end they may not grow too warlike and expert; but leaving them by Treaties and Pacifications to their ea&s;e, keep them&s;elves &s;till employed, and con&s;equently di&s;ciplined, and their Sables from ru&s;ting, by continual managing of them. They moreover never break out into a di&s;tant War, before they have compos'd Affairs with their Neighbours. Thus when they tran&s;port their Armies toward the Frontiers of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> they make Peace with the Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI> and &s;o on the contrary. But the unhappy <HI>Europeans,</HI> giving them more opportunities by their diffention to inlarge their Empire than any other, they, as well out of Ambition, as an irreconcileable Enmity to the Name of Chri&s;t, pur&s;ue the &s;ame with equal violence and hate. Hence it was, that though they had a Peace with the Emperour, they did not cea&s;e to countenance and a&s;&s;i&s;t his Rebels in <HI>Hungary</HI> underhand with their Forces and Pro|tections, receiving them, when clo&s;ely pur&s;u'd, into their own Quarters, where, being follow|ed by the Imperial Troops, &s;everal Ho&s;tilities were committed by them, which produced in &s;ome time an open rupture between the two Nations. The Emperour, to hinder this Com|merce betwixt them, di&s;patch'd <HI>Meninsky,</HI> his Interpreter for the Oriental Languages, to the <HI>Port;</HI> with in&s;tructions to di&s;cover whether the Ho&s;tilities which were committed upon his Subjects, were done by command of the Mini|&s;ters at that Court? But he could effect nothing. He had indeed had Audience of the Vi&s;ier at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> who only told him, That the Grand Seignior would &s;end a Chiaux of his own to his Imperial Maje&s;ty, who &s;hould inform him of his Intentions.</P>
<P>The Emperour hereupon di&s;patched an Ex|pre&s;s to Count <HI>Schaffgots,</HI> his Envoy in <HI>Poland,</HI> with orders to endeavour to break the Nego|tiation of Peace betwixt that Crown and the Sultan, though this Precaution proved of no effect, the Treaty betwixt tho&s;e Potentates be|ing &s;igned pre&s;ently after, and very &s;ea&s;onably on the <HI>Poles</HI> &s;ide, who, having an Army &s;carce of 15000 Men, were &s;urrounded near <HI>Zorawno,</HI> by well night 200000 Turks, who yet gave them Peace when they lea&s;t expected it, tho' upon Conditions then not ungrateful, tho' af|terwards quarrell'd at. The <HI>Tran&s;ilvanians</HI> did al&s;o joyn with the Malecontents, for Prince <HI>Abaffi,</HI> having di&s;covered a Con&s;piracy again&s;t his Life, in <HI>April,</HI> and &s;u&s;pecting the <HI>Germans</HI> to have de&s;igned it, it contributed much to engage him again&s;t them. About the end of this Month the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Buda</HI> was &s;trangled by order of the Grand Seignior, perhaps by rea|&s;on of his immen&s;e Riches; for they found two Millions of Money, which was brought into the Sultan's Trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>In the beginning of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> there happened an Encounter betwixt the <HI>Malecontents</HI> and the <HI>Croats,</HI> where the fir&s;t were wor&s;ted; but the Turks at the &s;ame time pillaged a Town near <HI>Raab,</HI> putting all the Inhabitants to the Sword; and 4000 of the&s;e Infidels, having gained the Pa&s;&s;age of the River <HI>Hydrousk,</HI> upon the Fron|tiers of <HI>Croatia</HI> and <HI>Styria,</HI> ravaged the Country even to the Gates of <HI>Papa,</HI> of <HI>Ve&s;prin</HI> and of <HI>Le|grat,</HI> driving away a great number of Cattel, and burning a great many Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>Prince <HI>Abaffi,</HI> finding that the Grand Seigni|or did approve of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance he gave the <HI>Hun|garians</HI> &s;ent them fre&s;h Troops, with twenty pieces of Cannon. Their Army being com|manded by Count <HI>We&s;&s;elini,</HI> their Palatine, a|mounting to 16000 Men, de&s;igned to be&s;iege <HI>Zatmar</HI> and <HI>Kalo,</HI> which Major General <HI>Smith,</HI> who commanded the <HI>Germans,</HI> perceiving, he &s;ent a Convoy with Artillery and Ammunition to the fir&s;t of the&s;e places, which was defeated and taken by the <HI>Malecontents.</HI> But my de&s;ign not being to de&s;cribe this War, I &s;hall only men|tion it, as far forth as I find the Turks, who&s;e Hi&s;tory we write, concerned in it. Upon con|clu&s;ion of the Peace in <HI>Poland,</HI> the <HI>Hungarians</HI> had &s;ent thither to engage part of the Troops which that King had disbanded, to their Ser|vice, and obtained 6000 of them, commanded by the Count of <HI>Boham,</HI> who joyning with the <HI>Hungarian</HI> Hor&s;e, defeated <HI>Smith,</HI> with part of the Imperial Army, who de&s;igned to ob&s;truct their Conjunction with <HI>We&s;&s;elini;</HI> which how|ever being effected, they could &s;carce &s;uffice to with&s;tand General <HI>Kops,</HI> in &s;o much that being a&s;&s;ured that the Peace was not only concluded betwixt the <HI>Poles</HI> and the <HI>Turks,</HI> but that the
<PB N="279" REF="136"><HI>Palatine of Culm</HI> was &s;ent to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> to &s;ee it ratified, they al&s;o deputed one of their princi|pal Officers to endeavour to oblige the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> to turn his Arms again&s;t the <HI>German Em|pire.</HI> But being the Turks were in actual War with the Great Duke of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> they would not (being already engaged again&s;t &s;o power|ful an Enemy) intangle them&s;elves in a new War: And yet this <HI>Envoy</HI> obtained &s;o much, that Orders were &s;ent to the Ba&s;&s;aes of <HI>Buda,</HI> of <HI>Belgrade, Waradin,</HI> and other Places in <HI>Hun|gary,</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t them with all their Power. And they were a&s;&s;i&s;ted by them, for the&s;e Infidels, not content to &s;end Troops to joyn with them, they them&s;elves made &s;everal Incur&s;ions in their favour. Four hundred Men of the Garri&s;on of <HI>Nieuhau&s;el</HI> took &s;everal Pri&s;oners by <HI>Neutra,</HI> and beat the <HI>Hu&s;&s;ars</HI> of <HI>Comorra</HI> who would have oppo&s;ed them; two thou&s;and Turks entred in|to <HI>Croatia,</HI> and having &s;poiled the Country a|bout <HI>Zaklholm,</HI> they defeated a party of Impe|riali&s;ts near <HI>Carl&s;tat.</HI> And thus the&s;e Infidels made War without declaring it, pretending they did not violate the Peace by the&s;e parti|cular Encounters. But the Emperour being of another opinion, di&s;patch'd <HI>Hoffman,</HI> his Secre|tary of State and War, to complain to the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> how his Ba&s;&s;aes did daily a&s;&s;i&s;t his Rebels, again&s;t the purport of the Peace be|twixt the two Empires. Being admitted to au|dience by the Grand Vi&s;ier, that Mini&s;ter made him &s;ome propo&s;itions for the renewing of the Peace, but &s;o di&s;advantageous to his Ma&s;ter, that it &s;eemed apparent, that the Turks &s;ought for nothing more than a pretence to break. And yet the Secretary effected &s;o much for the pre|&s;ent, that the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Waradin</HI> was arre&s;ted, and afterwards &s;trangled by order of the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> who yet would give that &s;atisfaction to the Emperour upon the pre&s;&s;ing In&s;tances of his Secretary, who al&s;o had made rich Pre&s;ents to all the Mini&s;ters of the Port.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t <HI>Hoffman</HI> negotiated with &s;o little &s;uc|ce&s;s at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> the States of <HI>Hungary</HI> a&s;|&s;embled at <HI>Altemburg,</HI> where it was re&s;olved, that the Churches which had been taken from the Prote&s;tants, &s;hould be re&s;tored to them, and many other points remitted in their Favour, in hopes the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions might oblige them to re|turn to their Duty, and break tho&s;e Engage|ments they had entred into with the Infidels. But this pa&s;&s;ed no farther, for the Mini&s;ters endeavoured to elude the &s;aid Article, though the mo&s;t important of all, and therefore the more in&s;i&s;ted upon by the <HI>Malecontents.</HI> This gave the Deputies of the Diet &s;ubject to believe that though the Mini&s;ters of the Emperour &s;eemed to de&s;ire an Accommodation, yet they did not &s;earch the means to affect it. And now the <HI>Malecontents,</HI> in&s;tead of conforming to the Emperour's Intentions, re&s;olved to elect another King, and &s;ome of them propo&s;ed one of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Frangipani;</HI> though it did not take, being they could not agree upon the choice of their Sovereign.</P>
<P>The Truth is, the Palatines and great Men of the Kingdom, being weary to &s;ee the Crown as it were Hereditary in the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> made u&s;e of the pretence of Religion to &s;tir up the People, and oblige them to take Arms for defence of their Liberty, both Spiritual and Civil. And this aver&s;ion was the true Cau&s;e of the War.</P>
<P>The Emperour was no le&s;s di&s;&s;atisfied with the Turks; for General <HI>Kops,</HI> having &s;ent com|plaints to the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Waradin,</HI> for that he had given Quarters to the <HI>Hungarians</HI> in Places which depended on his government; the Ba&s;|&s;a told him, That he look'd upon them as Pa&s;|&s;engers, who paid for what they took for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, and that con&s;equently he could not look upon their Reception into his Territories as any violation of the Peace.</P>
<P>The Ho&s;tilities betwixt the Imperiali&s;ts and the Turks did &s;till continue notwith&s;tanding their Negotiations. Five hundred Chri&s;tian Hor&s;e, commanded by <HI>Azos Benas,</HI> advancing towards <HI>Erlaw,</HI> were cut in pieces by the Infi|dels. Another Party, commanded by Collonel <HI>Wolping,</HI> was likewi&s;e defeated by a Detach|ment from the Garri&s;on of <HI>Newhau&s;el,</HI> with the lo&s;s of above 200, the Commander being al&s;o much hurt. A few days after this Encounter the Ba&s;&s;a of that City dyed, which occa&s;ioned an Accident which did well-nigh make a rup|ture betwixt the Emperour and the Port. The Imperiali&s;ts had unadvi&s;edly attack'd the new Ba&s;&s;a which the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> did &s;end to <HI>New|hau&s;el,</HI> and defeated his Convoy con&s;i&s;ting of 200 Hor&s;e, by way of Repri&s;al, as they gave out, for the Damages which had been done them by the Garri&s;on of the Place, without con&s;idering that this new Governour had had no &s;hare in the&s;e Violences. The Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Bu|da</HI> &s;ent his complaints of this Affront to the Im|perial General, with threats that he would ac|quaint his Ma&s;ter with it, and exact &s;atisfaction by all the ways imaginable. And they did &s;o, for, drawing out &s;trong Parties from the Gar|ri&s;on of <HI>Erlam</HI> and <HI>Waradin,</HI> they re&s;olved to revenge the In&s;ult done to the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Newhau|&s;el,</HI> and marching towards <HI>Sando</HI> near <HI>Butrac,</HI> which they pillaged, they returned with above 200 Pri&s;oners. Count <HI>Wourmb,</HI> the Emperour's General, demanded Ju&s;tice for this Violence from the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Buda,</HI> but received no other an&s;wer, but that what was done was by way of Repri&s;al.</P>
<P>During the&s;e Traver&s;es Count <HI>Paul We&s;&s;e|lini</HI> dyed, who had Commanded the Army of the <HI>Malecontents</HI> with great &s;ucce&s;s, but is &s;uc|ceeded by Count <HI>Tekeley,</HI> young, yet wary and brave; who, to this day heads the however broken di&s;contented Party. The Emperour, who knew that the greate&s;t force of <HI>Tekeley</HI>'s Army came from <HI>Tran&s;ilvania,</HI> would divert <HI>Abaffi</HI> by re-e&s;tabli&s;hing the Party of <HI>Pedipold,</HI> who had formerly conte&s;ted for the Sovereign|ty of that Principality. To this end he obliged that Prince to &s;end four Deputies to <HI>Con&s;tantino|ple,</HI> to implore the protection of the Grand Seig|nior, but the Vi&s;ier cau&s;ed them to be put into the Ca&s;tle of the &s;even Towers, which extreme|ly &s;urpri&s;ed the Emperour's Re&s;ident, who had orders to Negotiate that Affair joyntly with them. The Emperour being informed hereof, &s;ent <HI>Mon&s;ieur Jullies</HI> with &s;ecret In&s;tructions to the Port, but he dyed by the way, which did not a little trouble his Imperial Maje&s;ty, being all this Envoy's Papers fell into Count <HI>Teke|ley</HI>'s Hands, who drew no &s;mall advantage from the lights he received by them. <HI>Hoffman,</HI> Se|cretary of State, returning from <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> was &s;topped at <HI>Belgrade,</HI> being the Ba&s;&s;a of that Place refu&s;ed to furni&s;h him with nece&s;&s;aries for the continuation of his Journey. But the Emperour, having di&s;patch'd an Expre&s;s to the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Buda</HI> to complain of this incivility, he obtained what he de&s;ired. Being upon his de|parture from <HI>Belgrade,</HI> he was informed that the Great Vi&s;ier was arrived upon the Banks of the <HI>Danube</HI> with a great Army, and de&s;ign to enter into the Province of <HI>&V;kraine</HI> to fight the <HI>Mu&s;covites;</HI> he &s;ent to demand Audience of him, but this Mini&s;ter returned him for an&s;wer, That
<PB N="280" REF="137">he &s;hould have it at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> when the Campaign was ended. Many and great were the Encounters betwixt the Imperiali&s;ts and Malecontents, the latter being for the mo&s;t part &s;ucce&s;sful, who al&s;o ravaged <HI>Moravia,</HI> being a&s;|&s;i&s;ted by 2000 <HI>Tartars,</HI> and <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> it &s;elf, under the Command of Collonel <HI>Jo&s;ua,</HI> &s;ometimes a Prie&s;t, known by the Name of Father <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> who turning Prote&s;tant, rai&s;ed 6000 Men at his own Charges, and joyning with the Male|contents, grew formidable even to the Gates of <HI>Vienna.</HI> But the Imperiali&s;ts had al&s;o their turn, and Count <HI>E&s;terha&s;i,</HI> Governour of <HI>Papa,</HI> at|tacked 2000 Janizaries and 500 Spahies, near <HI>Ve&s;pren:</HI> He took &s;everal Pri&s;oners, and a|mong&s;t them &s;ome Agas. As this Action might cau&s;e a Rupture, if mi&s;-repre&s;ented be|twixt the two Empires; his Imperial Maje&s;ty di&s;patch'd a Courier to the Port, to inform the Grand Seignior with the particulars of this Combat.</P>
<P>The con&s;tancy of the Malecontents, and their Intelligence with the Turks did not a little di&s;|quiet the Emperour, but he was more troubled when he heard that the&s;e Infidels were upon the point of agreeing with the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> which would put them into a Condition to turn all their power again&s;t him. He thought he could not do better than to divert them by obliging the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> to break with them, and therefore &s;ent the Baron of <HI>Meierburg</HI> to <HI>Hi&s;pahan</HI> to negotiate that Affair.</P>
<P>The Diet of <HI>Tran&s;ilvania</HI> being held at <HI>Clau|&s;enburg,</HI> the Grand Seignior, as well to &s;ecure his own Intere&s;t, as being di&s;&s;atisfied with Prince <HI>Abaffi</HI>'s Conduct, &s;ent the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Waradin</HI> with a &s;trong Army to pre&s;ide at that A&s;&s;embly. But things being accommodated betwixt them, to the &s;atisfaction of the &s;tronge&s;t; the <HI>Tran&s;il|vanian</HI> and the Ba&s;&s;a's bordering upon his Prin|cipality, who had been at the Diet, had no other thoughts but of deliberating with the Depu|ties of the <HI>Hungarians,</HI> of the means how to a&s;&s;i&s;t them. The Emperour being adverti&s;ed hereof, &s;ent Doctor <HI>Ferling</HI> to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> to endeavour to penetrate into the Intentions of that Monarch, and hinder that the Ba&s;&s;aes &s;hould not &s;uccour the Rebels. There was al&s;o &s;ome under-hand dealing with the great ones or the Party, to make their particular Peace with the Court. Among&s;t others, the Propo&s;ition being made to <HI>Palaffi Imbre,</HI> he found &s;o little &s;ecurity in it, that to &s;hew his Companions he would never accommode him&s;elf with the Em|perour, he treated with the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Buda,</HI> to deliver all the Places that were in his power, in|to his hand and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the which al&s;o he put in Execution, tho' his Ca&s;tle of <HI>Devin</HI> was in the mean time inve&s;ted by Count <HI>Stra&s;oldo,</HI> before the Turks could enter it, and together with the City forced by him, 500 of the Gar|ri&s;on being made Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>The Grand Seignior, to &s;hew the e&s;teem and &s;atisfaction he had of the Per&s;on of <HI>Abaffi,</HI> &s;ent him a Sable as a token of his Favour; and gave Orders at the &s;ame time to all the Ba&s;&s;aes of <HI>Hungary,</HI> to &s;end Troops and Forces as oft as he &s;hould require them, being ab&s;olutely re&s;olved to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Malecontents, which he al&s;o effe|ctively did.</P>
<P>There had happened a great Battel between the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> near <HI>Czecherin,</HI> which the fir&s;t had be&s;ieged. The Turks had been wor&s;ted at fir&s;t, but rallying their Forces, they came before <HI>Czecherin</HI> again, where, after play|ing eight or nine Mines, they &s;o furiou&s;ly a&s;|&s;aulted the Place, that they carried it, with the &s;laughter of the Garri&s;on, which was great; for all that, after many Skirmi&s;hes, they were forced to retire for want of Provi&s;ions. Here|upon the Great Duke of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> knowing that the Emperour, not without rea&s;on, apprehen|ded that the Turks would declare War again&s;t him, &s;ent him a &s;olemn Emba&s;&s;ie, with offer of making a League Offen&s;ive and Defen&s;ive with him again&s;t the Infidels; but the Empe|rour, contrary to the advice of <HI>Montecuculi,</HI> who offered to Command the Army in Per|&s;on, tho' his great Age might ju&s;tly di&s;pence with the Fatigues of War; did not think it advi&s;able to break with the Port. The Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Buda,</HI> being informed of the arrival of the Amba&s;&s;adour, &s;ent a Chaoux to <HI>Vienna,</HI> under colour of complaining of &s;ome Inroads which the Imperiali&s;ts had made into the Grand Seignior's Territories, but indeed to ob&s;erve the motions of the <HI>Mu&s;covites.</HI> Nor were they the onely motives that exhorted the Empe|rour to Arm again&s;t the Turks. The King of <HI>Poland</HI> &s;ent Prince <HI>Radzivil</HI> to a&s;&s;ure his Impe|rial Maje&s;ty, that he would willingly enter in|to a League again&s;t the Infidels, if he could re|&s;olve to declare War again&s;t them: And how|ever, two Nuntios of the Pope's, who were then at Court, did pre&s;s this Prince to deter|mine to prevent the Enemy, who would not fail to attack him, when a favourable Occa&s;ion pre&s;ented it &s;elf; they could not per&s;wade him to embrace a Propo&s;ition &s;o favourable for the repo&s;e of <HI>Hungary.</HI></P>
<P>The Emperour, not finding him&s;elf in a Condition to reduce the Malecontents by force, re&s;olved to grant what they demanded, pro|vided they would permit him to levy in <HI>Hungary</HI> the &s;ame Contributions and Taxes which were exacted in the Hereditary Coun|trey. Count <HI>Le&s;ley</HI> had &s;everal Conterences with Collonel <HI>Jo&s;ua</HI> thereupon; and having di&s;cu&s;&s;ed this Affair, the principal points were agreed upon, which being communicated to <HI>Keski</HI> and <HI>Tekeley,</HI> they promi&s;ed to procure the con&s;ents of the other Chiefs to agree to them. Upon this favourable di&s;po&s;ition, <HI>Le&s;ley</HI> had orders to &s;end his Troops into Winter Quarters; but the precipitate departure of the Emperour to <HI>Mazianzel,</HI> and thence to <HI>Prague,</HI> by rea&s;on of the Plague at <HI>Vienna,</HI> this Affair was interrup|ted, and all the mea&s;ures taken in it changed.</P>
<P>The Plague &s;pread al&s;o into the Turki&s;h Countries, and con&s;trained 500 Families to quit <HI>Newhau&s;el.</HI> The&s;e were &s;carce got a League from the Town, but they were &s;urpri&s;ed by five hundred <HI>Hu&s;ars</HI> or <HI>Haiducs,</HI> who took from them all they had, of which the Turks made great complaints, which &s;eemed the more rea|&s;onable, being they were &s;o civil to Count <HI>Le&s;|ley</HI>'s Troops; for he being obliged by the Conta|gion to change Quarters, encamped betwixt <HI>Chem|nitz</HI> and <HI>Strigonium,</HI> for the better &s;ub&s;i&s;tance of his Army. The Ba&s;&s;a of this la&s;t place, to &s;hew the Count that the Grand Seignior did not ap|prove of his Subjects joyning with the Malecon|tents; permitted him to buy &s;uch Provi&s;ions as he wanted in the Territories of his Juri&s;dicti|on, and al&s;o pre&s;ented him with &s;everal refre&s;h|ments him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> pre&s;&s;ed the King of <HI>Poland</HI> to conclude a League Offen&s;ive and Defen&s;ive with them again&s;t the Grand Seignior; this Prince being not aver&s;e to the propo&s;ition, com|manded his Re&s;ident to repre&s;ent to the Empe|rour, that being he would not engage in this Union, he ought at lea&s;t to keep a &s;tanding Ar|my in <HI>Hungary</HI> of 30000 Men, to oppo&s;e the
<PB N="281" REF="137">Malecontents, and keep the Turks in &s;u&s;pence on that &s;ide, and his Maje&s;ty promi&s;ed to do it; but the want of Monies hindered him to exe|cute a De&s;ign &s;o honourable for him&s;elf, and &s;o adventageous for Chri&s;tendom.</P>
<P>However, he endeavoured by the Baron of <HI>Kaunitz,</HI> his Re&s;ident at the Port, to negotiate a Continuation of the <HI>Trevis;</HI> but the Grand Seignior would not con&s;ent to it but upon con|dition, that he &s;hould be at liberty to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Malecontents at plea&s;ure; which indeed had been to augment the Evil, not heal it. This Prince was at the &s;ame time adverti&s;ed, that the Port had concluded a Peace with the <HI>Poles</HI> and the <HI>Mu&s;covites;</HI> which gave him occa&s;ion to judge that he had a De&s;ign to turn his Arms a|gain&s;t him.</P>
<P>Many were the Treaties betwixt he Empe|rour and the Malecontents, and his Maje&s;ty's conce&s;&s;ions &s;uch, that the Grand Seignior began to apprehend, that <HI>Tekeley</HI> had &s;ome inclinations to return to his Obedience to his Sovereign; to prevent which, he &s;ent a Ba&s;&s;a to divert him, by offering him the Principality of <HI>Tran&s;ilvania,</HI> after the decea&s;e of <HI>Abaffi.</HI> This Ba&s;&s;a had &s;e|veral Conferences with him and with the other Chiefs of the Faction, and did &s;o well manage them, with the pretended advantages that they would find by putting them&s;elves under the Pro|tection of the Port, that eighty of them did promi&s;e, in the name of all the Kingdom, to pay to his <HI>Ottoman</HI> Highne&s;s a Tribute of eighty thou&s;and Crowns, provided he would power|fully a&s;&s;i&s;t them. This Intrigue being made known to the Emperour, he received it with much Indignation, commanding, that none of the contrivers of it &s;hould appear at the Diet. In the mean time he ordered the Marque&s;s of <HI>Baden,</HI> and the Count of <HI>Staremburg,</HI> to cau&s;e <HI>Raab</HI> and <HI>Vienna,</HI> whereof they were Governours, to be fortified, to prevent any De&s;igns of the Turks upon tho&s;e Places. And now his Imperial Ma|je&s;ty did no more que&s;tion but that the Infidels would tran&s;port the War into <HI>Hungary,</HI> e&s;peci|ally, being informed by his Re&s;ident <HI>Kaunitz</HI> at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> that the Port, after many and long Di&s;putes, had at length concluded a Ce&s;|&s;ation with the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> for twenty years, up|on Condition, that be&s;ides <HI>Kiovia,</HI> they &s;hould enjoy <HI>Tripol, Staiki</HI> and <HI>Va&s;ikow,</HI> which had al|ways been dependants upon <HI>Kiovia.</HI> The Grand Vi&s;ier received the&s;e Propo&s;itions with joy, and writ to the <HI>Czar</HI> thereupon, with very extraordi|nary Prai&s;es and Titles, a&s;&s;uring him in the name of the Grand Seignior, that he would ratifie the Conditions agreed upon, and that he might &s;end his Amba&s;&s;adour to fini&s;h the Treaty. In the mean time, the Vi&s;ier, to prevent the <HI>Czar</HI>'s refu&s;al of &s;ending another Mini&s;ter before his, which re&s;ided at the Port, (who had been kept under re&s;traint for &s;ome time) was returned into <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> he forthwith di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him, with magnificent Pre&s;ents for his Ma&s;ter. The Grand Seignior, who &s;eemed re&s;olved to invade <HI>Hun|gary,</HI> &s;taying his removal to <HI>Adrianople</HI> but till the return of this Amba&s;&s;adour, did emit a Ma|nife&s;t or Mandate directed to Prince <HI>Abaffi,</HI> in the&s;e following terms.</P>
<P><HI>Fora&s;much as tho&s;e of</HI> Hungary, <HI>who have received the Emperour of the</HI> Nazarien <HI>Nation to be their Lord, have been &s;poiled of their Country and Ca&s;tles by the</HI> Germans, <HI>and have therefore had recour&s;e to our Clemency for Protection; it is Our plea&s;ure, in re|gard of their long and piteous mi&s;eries, and being there|unto moved by their reiterated Prayers and Supplica|tions, graciou&s;ly to affranchi&s;e them from the Yoke of that Nation. 'Tis therefore that We communicate this De&s;ign to you, as Our faithful Mini&s;ter, by the Ba&s;&s;a</HI> Caput, <HI>and the Aga</HI> Starra, <HI>with expre&s;s Com|mand, that you make your &s;elf forthwith ready to deli|ver the</HI> Hungarians <HI>from the Oppre&s;&s;ion of their Ene|mies, with all the Forces of</HI> Tran&s;ilvania, <HI>which &s;hall be immediately reinforced with tho&s;e of</HI> Valachia, <HI>and of the Ba&s;&s;a of</HI> Sili&s;tria, 13003 <HI>Janizaries, and</HI> 2000 <HI>Hor&s;e; for We have promi&s;ed them Our Impe|rial Protection in con&s;ideration of the Fidelity which they have manife&s;ted to &V;s, which We have &s;ince had experience of. And therefore We Command you yet again to neglect nothing that may tend to the Execu|tion of Our Plea&s;ure and good Will, to the end, that by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the mo&s;t High and mo&s;t Mighty God, this People, &s;o cruelly oppre&s;&s;ed, may be forthwith delivered from the Bondage of the unmerciful</HI> Ger|mans. <HI>In the mean time, you &s;hall from time to time inform Our great</HI> Ottoman <HI>Mightine&s;s with what &s;hall happen, and what you &s;hall have done pur&s;uant here|unto. And you are farther enjoyned to take heed that you do nothing that may be di&s;advantageous to Our In|comparable Greatne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Abaffi,</HI> animated with this Mandate, and ha|ving received the Orders that were nece&s;&s;ary, drew his Troops together, and joyned with <HI>Te|keley,</HI> with the <HI>Turks,</HI> the <HI>Valachians</HI> and the <HI>Mol|davians,</HI> emitting withal a Declaration, That he did not Arm again&s;t the Intere&s;t of Chri&s;ten|dom, but only to deliver the Prote&s;tants of <HI>Hungary</HI> from the Oppre&s;&s;ion they laboured un|der, by re&s;toring them in their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and their Churches, and re-e&s;tabli&s;hing them in their ancient Priviledges. He added, that the Grand Seignior had expre&s;ly commi&s;&s;ioned him for this Expedition, which he al&s;o undertook with the con&s;ent of all the States of <HI>Tran&s;ilvania.</HI> He had be&s;ieged <HI>Zatmar,</HI> and pre&s;&s;ed the place vi|gorou&s;ly, to &s;hew the Defendants that he was in a Condition to force them if they would not voluntarily Surrender. A few days after, he received a recruit of 8000 Men, which the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Buda</HI> &s;ent him, who had already a&s;&s;embled an Army of 40000 Men, which he incamped near the place of his Government.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t <HI>Abaffi</HI> was engaged in the afore&s;aid Siege, 3000 Turks made an Inroad into <HI>Styria</HI> near <HI>Gratz,</HI> where they took a 1000 Pri&s;oners, which they made Slaves, and very much Pil|lage. And now the Grand Seignior re&s;olves not only to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Malecontents, but joyntly with them to force the Places of <HI>Hungary,</HI> until they were in a condition to pay him the Tri|bute they were engaged to do. In the mean time, <HI>Abaffi,</HI> having made his Circumvallation about <HI>Zatmar,</HI> divided his Army into four Bo|dies: The fir&s;t was compo&s;ed of the <HI>Tran&s;ilvani|ans,</HI> the &s;econd of the <HI>Moldavians,</HI> the third of <HI>Turks,</HI> and the fourth of the <HI>Malecontents,</HI> and he forced the City, but could not take the Citadel, which obliged him to rai&s;e his Siege. Many were the Di&s;cour&s;es of this Action, and &s;ome gave out, that <HI>Abaffi</HI> had no mind to take the Place, upon a Surmi&s;e, that the Grand Seignior pretended it &s;hould be delivered into his Hands upon Surrender. However it was, it is certain that the Ba&s;&s;a which commanded the <HI>Ottomans</HI> at this Siege, &s;ent great Complaints to <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople</HI> again&s;t this Prince, which obliged him to return into his own Countrey, le&s;t his Enemies &s;hould take advantage by his ab&s;ence. Thus this great Army vani&s;hed, as well by the mi&s;in|telligence of the Chiefs, and the rigour of the Sea&s;on, the Winter approaching; as by the Vi|gilancy of Count <HI>Caprara,</HI> the Imperial General; who, tho' he was not able to fight the Enemy,
<PB N="282" REF="138">did notwith&s;tanding perpetually incommode them with Parties and Detachments. <HI>Tekely</HI> hereupon having pillaged and burnt <HI>Kalo,</HI> ex|cept the Citadel, which he garri&s;oned, put his Troops into their Winter quarters. But the Turks, to fini&s;h their Campania would &s;urpri&s;e the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Pettinia,</HI> upon the Borders of <HI>Croa|tia,</HI> but their de&s;ign being di&s;covered, the <HI>Militia</HI> of the Country drawing into a body, forced them to retire.</P>
<P>On the &s;ide of the Chri&s;tians, the Winter was &s;pent in fruitle&s;s Treaties and Conte&s;tations be|twixt the Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks and Seculars; &s;ave that the Empre&s;s was crowned Queen of <HI>Hungary,</HI> which was effected with great Magnificence and Pomp. On the other &s;ide, the Turks having agreed with the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> the Grand Seignior re&s;olved by the Council of his great Vi&s;ier, to carry his Arms into <HI>Hungary;</HI> in order to which, va&s;t Magazins were made at <HI>Belgrade</HI> and other places of his Obedience. He &s;ent &s;uch Bodies of Men thither, that the Souldiers were forced to lye in Tents and Baracks. <HI>Hali Ba&s;&s;a,</HI> being &s;ent thither in the Spring with Monies to pay the&s;e Forces, behaved him&s;elf with &s;o little Pru|dence, that he had well nigh occa&s;ioned a great Mutiny among&s;t them. In his review of them he cau&s;ed the <HI>Spahies</HI> to pa&s;s before the <HI>Janizaries,</HI> who being extream jealous of their rank, mu|tinied, and threatned to kill him. To repair this fault, he would re&s;tore them to their Prece|dence, but the Spahies took al&s;o their turn to mutiny; nor did he appea&s;e them but by a con|&s;iderable gratuity above their pay. Be&s;ides the&s;e, the preparations for War through all the extent of the <HI>Otthoman</HI> Empire wer &s;o va&s;t, that they did not &s;uffice only to protect the <HI>Malecontents,</HI> but to attack that of <HI>Germany,</HI> and now they lay a Bridge over the <HI>Danube,</HI> and another at <HI>Zol|nock,</HI> over the <HI>Teys</HI> or <HI>Tibi&s;cus,</HI> capable of bearing their great Cannon.</P>
<P><HI>Tekely,</HI> however well informed of the De&s;igns of the Port, did notwith&s;tanding agree to a pro|longation of the <HI>Trevis</HI> with Count <HI>Caprara,</HI> which was ended the la&s;t of <HI>March,</HI> to the fir&s;t of <HI>July;</HI> but the <HI>Malecontents</HI> &s;lighting the Treaty, did in the beginning of <HI>May</HI> &s;eize upon all the Corn which the Emperour had bought upon the Fron|tiers of <HI>Poland</HI> to furni&s;h his <HI>Magazins</HI> withal. The Turks al&s;o attacked and forced a Commi&s;|&s;ary who conducted many Wagons loaden with Cloths for the Imperial Army.</P>
<P><HI>Tekely,</HI> being to act as &s;oon as the Treaty was ended joyntly with the Turks, judged it pro|per for him to take his mea&s;ures from the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Buda,</HI> in order to which he went to wait up|on him with a Convoy of 3000 Hor&s;e; the Ba&s;|&s;a being adverti&s;ed of his arrival, gave his Son orders to go and receive him at the Gate of the City, at the Head of the <HI>Spahies,</HI> or Hor&s;e, to com|plement him in his Name, and to regale him with refre&s;hments according to the Cu&s;tom of that Nation. Being enter'd the City, he was received by the Ba&s;&s;a at the head of all his Ja|nizaries, and after reciprocal Civilities, he a&s;&s;u|red him of the Protection of the Grand Seignior when ever he had need of it. His Troops in the mean time were lodged near <HI>Pe&s;th</HI> along the Ri|ver &s;ide in Tents. The Ba&s;&s;a, cau&s;ing <HI>Tekely</HI>'s Bonnet to be taken off, put another after the Turki&s;h fa&s;hion upon his Head, enrich'd 'with pretious Stones and a Heron's Feather. He fur|ther made him a Pre&s;ent from his <HI>Otthoman</HI> High|ne&s;s, of a Sable, a Pole-ax, and a Colours. He gave him al&s;o upon his own account, &s;ome Hor|&s;es richly harne&s;&s;ed; &s;ome affirmed that his Ci|vilities pa&s;&s;ed further, and that <HI>Tekely</HI> was de|clared King of <HI>Hungary</HI> by the Ba&s;&s;a, who put the Crown upon his Head, and cloathed him in Royal Habiliments, in pre&s;ence of all the Officers of the Garri&s;on, and &s;everal Ba&s;&s;aes, who had been expre&s;ly commanded thither to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the Ceremony.</P>
<P><HI>Tekely</HI> having &s;atisfied his Ambition, would now content his Love.

She, who as &s;he had not de&s;ired to &s;ee him a King, but to prevent her de&s;cent into a lower rank then that wherein Prince <HI>Rogotsky</HI> had placed her, &s;ent him word that he might come to <HI>Montcatz,</HI> where, after his return from <HI>Buda,</HI> their Marriage was celebrated with great Pomp. This Lady was Si&s;ter to Count <HI>Serin,</HI> a Roman Catholick, but in &s;ome few Weeks after her e&s;pou&s;als with Count <HI>Tekely,</HI> &s;he turn'd Prote|&s;tant, and thereupon di&s;charged all her Catho|lick Servants. This gave &s;o much &s;u&s;pition to the Imperial Court, that no more good was ex|pected from that Alliance; nor were they decei|ved, his Attachments to the Port being too &s;trict, and his jealou&s;ie of the <HI>Germans</HI> too great. He for all that treated &s;till with Count <HI>Saponara</HI> the Emperours Envoy, but it was to amuze him, in expectation of the Turks taking the field to &s;econd his De&s;igns. The Emperour did al&s;o employ Count <HI>Serin</HI> to his new Brother-in-Law, but he, in&s;tead of &s;erving his Sovereign, enter'd into new Engagements, as &s;hall be declared hereafter.</P>
<P>In the beginning of <HI>July,</HI> the <HI>Tartars</HI> made inrodes as far as <HI>Trinchein,</HI> from whence they brought more than 18000 Slaves, killing all the old men, from whom they could expect no Ser|vice. The Palatine would have rai&s;ed the <HI>Mi|litia</HI> of the Country to oppo&s;e them, but the Prote&s;tants refu&s;ed to obey his Orders, until the Emperour would give them Satisfaction upon all the points that had been propo&s;ed in their Name the la&s;t Diet. About the end of the &s;ame Month his Imperial Maje&s;ty received Letters from Count <HI>Albret Caprara,</HI> which &s;ignified to him that he had received Audience from the Great Vi&s;ier, and that he could not obtain a prolongation of the <HI>Trevis,</HI> but upon the follow|ing Terms, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P>The&s;e Conditions &s;eemed &s;o har&s;h to the Em|perour, that he rejected them, preferring a War before &s;uch a &s;ordid accommodation.</P>
<P>The Ce&s;&s;ation betwixt <HI>Tekely</HI> and the <HI>Germans</HI> being ended, he joyned Forces with the Turks near <HI>Pe&s;t,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of 40000 Men. He pa&s;&s;ed near <HI>Ca&s;chaw</HI> or <HI>Ca&s;&s;ovia,</HI> and turning &s;uddenly, &s;urpri&s;ed the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Zatmar,</HI> and in a few days after took the City. <HI>Ca&s;&s;ovia</HI> and other con|&s;iderable Places ran the &s;ame fate. And now the Turks act by them&s;elves, <HI>Tokai</HI> rendring it &s;elf to them as &s;oon as they appeared before it. The Emperour &s;ent to complain to the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Buda</HI> of the&s;e Acts of Ho&s;tility; but he an&s;wer|ed, that he did not pretend to break the Ce&s;&s;ati|on in attacking the&s;e little places, which were but receptacles of Robbers, the Inhabitants there|of daily pillaging his Highne&s;&s;es quarters. Thus the &s;tronge&s;t &s;eldom fail of pretences to oppre&s;s the weake&s;t.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide, the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Waradin</HI> having be&s;ieged <HI>Fileck,</HI> pre&s;&s;ed it hard. He had alrea|dy a&s;&s;aulted the place thrice, and though <HI>Stra|zoldo, Caprara, Staremberg,</HI> and the <HI>Palatine</HI> ad|vanced with de&s;ign to relieve it; yet all the&s;e Generals, however brave, dur&s;t not attempt the Enemies Lines; and it might be &s;aid, that they were come &s;o far but to be witne&s;&s;es of the Vi|ctory, by the lo&s;s of the place which &s;urrendred it &s;elf. The &s;ixteenth of <HI>September,</HI> the <HI>Hungarians</HI> entred into the Turki&s;h Service, but the <HI>Ger|mans</HI> and all the Officers were made Pri&s;oners, becau&s;e they refu&s;ed to &s;ign the Capitulation, and the Women were made &s;laves, the Turks lo&s;t 2000 Janizaries in this &s;iege, which obliged them to treat the Officers with &s;o much Rigour, and perhaps the place which they demoli&s;hed was therefore razed, or rather to prevent the Malecontents (who demanded the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it) from enjoying it.</P>
<P>The &s;aid Ba&s;&s;a, after the forcing of <HI>Filek,</HI> went with 40000 Men and inve&s;ted <HI>Lewentz</HI> and <HI>Neutra,</HI> which &s;urrendred to him upon de|mand: And <HI>Tekeley,</HI> taking advantage of the ab&s;ence of <HI>Stra&s;oldo,</HI> rendred him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of the High-land Cities.

<P><HI>Tekeley,</HI> &s;eeing him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of the upper <HI>Hungary,</HI> e&s;pecially of the Cities thereof, which by their Mines of Gold made up a great part of the Revenues of the Crown, and now having refre&s;hed him&s;elf in the&s;e rich Quarters, he cau|&s;ed Moneys to be coined, repre&s;enting on one &s;ide his Effiges with this In&s;cription: <HI>Emericus Comes</HI> Tekeley <HI>Princeps</HI> Hongariae; and on the rever&s;e the&s;e words: <HI>Pro Deo, pro Patria &amp; pro Libertate.</HI> The Winter being now advanced, he &s;ent his Secretary to <HI>Vienna</HI> to offer a Ce&s;&s;ati|on of Arms. This propo&s;al was not di&s;agree|able to the Imperial Court, but they could not re&s;olve to leave the &s;aid upper Cities in his po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion; his Deputies repre&s;ented thereupon, That their Ma&s;ter could not part with them without the con&s;ent of the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Buda,</HI> but that he would favour the Imperial Work-men, and &s;uffer them to labour for his Maje&s;ties pro|fit, provided he might be allowed a Compen&s;a|tion for his Protection, if not, he threatned to de&s;troy the &s;aid Cities, worth 200000 Crowns yearly to his Imperial Maje&s;ty; after &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">|tercation the Ce&s;&s;ation was again agreed upon, and the Directors of the Mines were obliged to pay <HI>Tekeley</HI> &s;ix hundred Crowns every Week; this <HI>Trevis</HI> did not hinder &s;everal Encounters betwixt the Chri&s;tians and Turks. A Party of <HI>Hu&s;&s;ars</HI> in <HI>November</HI> defeated a Detatchment of the Infidels, commanded by an Aga, who was kill'd there. There were found in his Pockets nineteen Letters of the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Buda</HI>'s, writ to Officers of that Nation, ordering them to cau&s;e the Grand Seignior's Subjects to pay the Extra|ordinary Tribute, which his Highne&s;s was not accu&s;tomed to exact, but when he undertook &s;ome great War. Thus the Emperour was a&s;|certained that the Turks de&s;ign was to draw to|gether all their Forces to attack him the next Summer. He was confirmed in this Opinion by Letters from his Amba&s;&s;adour at the Port, who writ to him, that the Grand Seignior was gone from <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> on the twenty eighth of <HI>October</HI> to <HI>Adrianople;</HI> that the great Vi&s;ier fol|lowed him the next day; that Count <HI>Tekeley</HI> had complained at the Port of the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Bu|da,</HI> accu&s;ing him for having &s;eparated his Troops too far from his, and &s;o hindered him from making &s;uch con&s;iderable progre&s;&s;es in <HI>Hungary</HI> as he might otherwi&s;e have done; and finally, that the &s;aid Ba&s;&s;a was &s;ummoned up by the Grand Seignior to an&s;wer this Accu&s;ation.</P>
<P>The great Vi&s;ier, being expected at <HI>Belgrade,</HI> the Emperour &s;ent <HI>Satonara</HI> to meet him, to ob|tain more favourable Conditions than tho&s;e propo&s;ed to Count <HI>Albret Caprara.</HI> He &s;ent al&s;o Count <HI>Martinitz</HI> to the <HI>Pope,</HI> and to the other Princes of <HI>Italy</HI> to &s;ollicite for Succours in this extremity. Count <HI>Kaunitz</HI> was likewi&s;e &s;ent to <HI>Bavaria,</HI> and many other principal Men to the other Electors and Princes of the Empire, to in|vite their a&s;&s;i&s;tance in &s;o pre&s;&s;ing an Exigence. To the&s;e Count <HI>Walle&s;tein,</HI> a Knight of the Or|der of the Golden Fleece, was deputed into <HI>Po|land,</HI> to be pre&s;ent at the Diet of <HI>War&s;aw,</HI> to ne|gotiate a League with that Crown; and the Emperour commanded all his Regiments to be compleated and augmented, his Garri&s;ons to be fortified, and his Magazins to be filled for the better oppo&s;ing &s;o powerful an Enemy.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t both parties are preparing for a War with great Vigour, it will be conducible enough to the de&s;ign of our Hi&s;tory, to &s;ubjoyn an Ac|cident which had like to have made an ab&s;o|lute breach betwixt the <HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Port. <HI>Mon&s;ieur du Que&s;ne,</HI> having given chace to &s;even <HI>Cor&s;airs</HI> of <HI>Tripoly,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>French</HI> force the <HI>Tripolins</HI> into the Haven of <HI>Chio.</HI></NOTE> forced them into the Ha|ven of <HI>Chio,</HI> placing them&s;elves under the Can|non of the Fortre&s;s, to cover them&s;elves from the Enemy, but to no purpo&s;e, although the Governour of the Place &s;ent the <HI>French</HI> Admi|ral word, that they were under the Protection of the Grand Seignior; for <HI>Mon&s;ieur du Que&s;ne,</HI> in pro&s;ecution of his De&s;ign, when he was come up with them, fired upon them, the Governour did the &s;ame upon the <HI>French,</HI> but to no great purpo&s;e, being they were &s;o ill treated, that three of their Ve&s;&s;els were di&s;abled, and all of them forced under the very Walls of the For|tre&s;s, one of the Ba&s;tions of the &s;ame being like|wi&s;e almo&s;t ruined. <HI>Du Que&s;ne</HI> not yet &s;atisfied, blocked them up there, until the News thereof was come to <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> The Alarm was great there, and they were upon the point of falling upon them of the <HI>French</HI> Nation, untill their Amba&s;&s;adour there declared, that what was done, was in no wi&s;e acted again&s;t the <HI>Otto|man</HI> Port, but only again&s;t the afore&s;aid <HI>Cor&s;airs,</HI> who took the Ve&s;&s;els belonging to his Ma&s;ters Subjects, and therefore ought not to be received into the Grand Seigniors Ports.

<P>For all this the <HI>Ottomans</HI> were highly offend|ed with the dammage <HI>Du Que&s;ne</HI> had done at <HI>Scio,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Grand Seignior highly of|fended thereat.</NOTE> and demanded reparation from the Am|ba&s;&s;ador of <HI>France</HI> at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> who at fir&s;t would give no hearing to &s;uch frivolous Com|plaints, but fearing the <HI>French</HI> Merchants in <HI>Turkey</HI> might be incommoded by it, he &s;ince offered to make them a Pre&s;ent of his own ac|cord, not by any order from the King his Ma|&s;ter. The Turks judging the &s;aid Pre&s;ent too &s;mall, were in no wi&s;e &s;atisfied with it; &s;o that the Amba&s;&s;ador thought fit to make &s;ome addi|tion to it, which did as little &s;atisfie them. In the mean time <HI>Du Que&s;ne</HI> being &s;ailed out of the <HI>Archipelague,</HI> there came an Officer to the Am|ba&s;&s;ador, telling him, that the Grand Seignior was in no wi&s;e &s;atisfied with his Offer, as being in no wi&s;e proportionable to the dammage com|mitted at <HI>Scio,</HI> adding, that the whole Empire was offended at it: But yet in con&s;ideration of the ancient Amity betwixt the two Nations, they would pa&s;s it by, provided the dammage were repaired, alledging by way of &s;imilitude, that if our party &s;ued a Thief into a Friends Hou&s;e, and that &s;orhething were broke in it, the Pur|&s;uer would be obliged to pay it. The Amba&s;&s;a|dor replyed, that the harm which was done at <HI>Scio</HI> might be repaired with le&s;s than what he had already offered of his own, which was more than he could well bear, and that the Grand Seignior and Great Vi&s;ier ought to be &s;atisfied, that he ruined him&s;elf to con&s;erve the Peace be|twixt the two Empires, becau&s;e he much fear|ed, le&s;t the Pre&s;ent he had offered might not plea&s;e the King his Ma&s;ter, to whom he never, had made any mention of it. The Turki&s;h Of|ficer hereupon being angry, told him in the Name of the Grand Seignior and Great Vi&s;ier, that they were re&s;olved to put him into the <HI>&s;e|ven Towers,</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> Merchants in Pri&s;on; the <HI>Port</HI> knew very well that the <HI>French</HI> King did never di&s;approve of what his Amba&s;&s;adors did. The Grand Seignior and his Vi&s;ier were not to be mocked by a pre&s;ent of a few Clocks, Watches, Stuffs, and Diamonds of &s;mall value, in compen&s;ation of dammages of &s;even hundred <HI>Pur&s;es,</HI> ari&s;ing for the murther of 400 Turks, the ruine of a whole City, the de&s;truction of many <HI>Mo&s;ques,</HI> and the Ca&s;tle. The Amba&s;&s;a|dor replyed, that he was not at all &s;urpri&s;ed at his Choler, but that he &s;hould have been afraid if he had &s;poke in the&s;e Terms to the Chiaux, who&s;e &s;ub&s;titute he was; that the lives of Turks had never been valued &s;o high; that the num|ber of the &s;lain at <HI>Scio</HI> was not &s;o great, and that there had not been one man killed, if they had not received the Pyrats there with the French Pri&s;es; and finally, if they would put him into the &s;even Towers, he would not come out of it but by expre&s;s order from the King his Ma&s;ter, and that he was ready to follow him thither. The Officer being moved with the Re&s;olution of the Amba&s;&s;ador, a&s;&s;ured him, he &s;hould not fail to be conducted thither the next Morning, whereupon he replyed, he could not believe it, becau&s;e he knew the Sultan was ju&s;t, the Vi&s;ier prudent, and his King a powerful Prince. The Turk interrupting him here, told him, that he talk'd as if he had 100000 men with him, to whom the other added, that his Ma&s;ter had 400000 men, and always victorious, and as for him, he &s;poke like one that would be as good as his Word. The Vi&s;ier, highly offended with the Amba&s;&s;adors Di&s;cour&s;e, cau&s;ed him to be told by a <HI>Kiaia,</HI> that he mu&s;t add to his Pre&s;ent, or that he &s;hould be obliged for his Reputation to &s;end him to the &s;even Towers: but the Am|ba&s;&s;ador continued po&s;itive.

Some time after, the Vi&s;ier let him know that he would &s;peak with him him&s;elf, which the Amba&s;&s;ador denied, becau&s;e he had already re|fu&s;ed him the <HI>Sofa.</HI> However he did &s;o far com|ply as to go to him about the end of <HI>May,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">But is ap|pea&s;ed.</NOTE> where after many Conte&s;tations about increa&s;ing the Pre&s;ent, the Turks de&s;cended to 350000, and af|terwards to 100000 Crowns, to 10000, and fi|nally agreed upon 15000 Livers.

<P>The Emperour being &s;ufficiently &s;atisfied of the De&s;igns of the Mahometans upon <HI>Hungary</HI> and <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> order'd all his Collonels to compleat their Regiments by the fir&s;t of <HI>May,</HI> and gave out new Commi&s;&s;ions for &s;ix Regiments of Hor&s;e, and &s;everal of Foot to be rai&s;ed with all imaginable &s;peed.

The Inhabitants of the Suburbs had likewi&s;e order to empty their Cellars, that they might be filled with Earth, but deferred the pulling down of the Hou&s;es un|til they were a&s;&s;ured that the City &s;hould be be&s;ieged.

In the mean time, as al&s;o the whole Winter, the Citizens of <HI>Vienna</HI> had been trained and exerci&s;ed with great diligence, the better to enable them to re&s;i&s;t, in ca&s;e of a Siege, which their fears and the Enemies braggings gave them ju&s;t occa&s;ion to apprehend.

<P>The 18 of <HI>January,</HI> 6000 Turks entred into <HI>Cani&s;ia,</HI> mo&s;t Janizaries, and the Gari&s;ons of <HI>Bel|grade</HI> and <HI>Newhau&s;el</HI> were al&s;o augmented with great numbers of this Militia.

<P>The beginning of <HI>February,</HI> the Turks entred into the I&s;le of <HI>Serin</HI> in <HI>Croatia,</HI> where they com|mitted great di&s;orders.

Redoubts were built at both ends of the wooden Bridge, which is on the &s;ide neare&s;t the City, and the Bridge which traver&s;ed the great Arm of the <HI>Danube</HI> was taken down to build another on the other &s;ide of the Favorites, with &s;everal other &s;mall Forts for its &s;ecurity: Two hundred thou&s;and pallizadoes were &s;ent from <HI>Newburg</HI> to &s;erve for the Fortifi|cations of <HI>Vienna,</HI> whereof every Citizen under|took to maintain a Souldier well armed in ca&s;e the City &s;hould be be&s;ieged.

<P>However <HI>Tekely</HI> continued to block up the Pla|ces which remained in the Emperours Obedi|ence in upper <HI>Hungary,</HI> and to &s;hut up the Pa&s;&s;ages that no relief might be &s;ent to them; he did not cea&s;e how&s;oever to te&s;tifie to the Deputies of the Loyal Countries, that he did de&s;ire with Pa&s;&s;ion that his Imperial Maje&s;ty would grant him rea|&s;onable Conditions, that might re&s;tore him to the obedience which he owed him; and to make it appear to all the World, that he had not ta|ken Armns again&s;t him out of any animo&s;ity, he relea&s;ed an hundred <HI>German</HI> Pri&s;oners without Ran&s;om, and &s;ent to a&s;&s;ure the Emperour, that he had di&s;patched <HI>Fagou</HI> and <HI>Sirmay,</HI> his two chief Mini&s;ters, to the Port to endeavour to ob|tain
<PB N="286" REF="140">a prolongation of the Trevis. He &s;pake to the &s;ame purpo&s;e at the Diet he had convened, and relea&s;ed yet again eighty Pri&s;oners which he had taken at <HI>Tokay,</HI> and gave Count <HI>Herber|&s;tein</HI> his Liberty upon his parole.</P>
<P>The Turks, about the later end of <HI>February,</HI> made a new attempt upon the I&s;le of <HI>Schults</HI> with 1000 men of the Garri&s;on of <HI>Newhau&s;el,</HI> conduct|ed by an <HI>Hungarian</HI> Renegade; but the Ice, which was not &s;trong enough, breaking, a great number of them were drowned: the Imperiali&s;ts took many Pri&s;oners, and among&s;t others the Sub-governour of <HI>Newhaw&s;el's</HI> Son. A Turki&s;h Officer that offered ten thou&s;and Dollars for his Life had his Head chopt off. At the &s;ame time &s;everal new Troops of the Infidels arrived, who lodged at <HI>E&s;&s;ek,</HI> and along the Rivers <HI>Savus</HI> and <HI>Dravus.</HI> They armed &s;everal <HI>Brigantines,</HI> which vogued upon the <HI>Danube,</HI> to hinder the Imperi|ali&s;ts to &s;end any Succours or Ammunition to their Garri&s;ons.

<P>In <HI>March, Tekely,</HI> with a con&s;iderable body of the Turki&s;h and his own Troops, endeavoured to Surpri&s;e <HI>Tirnaw,</HI> to cut off the Communica|tion of the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Leopol&s;tat,</HI> with the River <HI>Waagh.</HI> But this Enterpri&s;e failing, this Count &s;ummoned a &s;econd Diet in upper <HI>Hungary,</HI> though tho&s;e of the Loyal Counties were admo|ni&s;hed not to appear there. At the &s;ame time Collonel <HI>Albert Caprara</HI> adverti&s;ed the Emperour, that the Grand Seignior offered to prolong the Ce&s;&s;ation if he would &s;urrender to him the I&s;les of <HI>Schults,</HI> of <HI>Serin,</HI> and of <HI>Raab,</HI> with the For|tre&s;&s;es of <HI>Raab</HI> and <HI>Comorra;</HI> but his Imperial Ma|je&s;ty did not think it expedient to accept of &s;uch di&s;advantageous Terms, which rendered the Turks entire Ma&s;ters of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and gave them an open pa&s;&s;age to the very Walls of <HI>Vienna.</HI> After that, it was impo&s;&s;ible for this Mini&s;ter to write any more to his Ma&s;ter, for the Turks kept &s;o &s;trict a Guard about him, that he was &s;uffered to have no Communication with any, for fear of informing the Emperour with the va&s;t preparations of War which were made in all the extent of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire.</P>
<P>The Turks at the &s;ame time &s;urpri&s;ed a Quar|ter of the Dragoons, kill'd forty, and took ma|ny Pri&s;oners; they lodged 15000 men in the Neighbourhood of <HI>E&s;&s;ek,</HI> to hinder the Imperi|ali&s;ts from burning the Bridge, and by that means hinder their Pa&s;&s;age into the lower <HI>Hun|gary.</HI> The Emperour on the other &s;ide cau&s;ed all his Forces on the &s;ide of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> except four Regiments which he left for the Frontiers, to march towards <HI>Vienna</HI> and <HI>Hungary.</HI> His Troops al&s;o that were in <HI>Bohemia</HI> under the com|mand of Count <HI>Taff,</HI> were commanded that way.</P>

<P>The Grand Seignior &s;hewed &s;o much pa&s;&s;ion for the War of <HI>Hungary,</HI> that to complement him, all the Mini&s;ters of the Court would par|ticularly contribute to it.

The Conditions of this mutual al|liance briefly were, that the Alliance &s;hould be not only defen&s;ive, but al&s;o offen&s;ive again&s;t the Turks, and la&s;t till both found their a&s;&s;ured re|po&s;e; neither &s;hould make Peace without con|&s;ent of the other; his Imperial Maje&s;ty &s;hould entertain 6000 Men, whereof 40000 &s;hould keep the Field, and the re&s;t be put in Gari&s;ons; the King of <HI>Poland</HI> will lead 40000 under his own Conduct: he &s;hall be al&s;o obliged to recover his Places in <HI>Podolia, Wallachia,</HI> and <HI>&V;krania,</HI> whil&s;t the Imperiali&s;ts &s;hall do the &s;ame by tho&s;e Places they left in <HI>Hungary;</HI> The <HI>Poles</HI> &s;hall fur|ni&s;h 6000 men to act again&s;t <HI>Tekely.</HI> Other Ar|ticles not immediately regarding the pre&s;ent War, are purpo&s;ely omitted.</P>

<P>The Emperour arrived in the Camp about Ten of the Clock, preceded by his Guards, and riding between the Dukes of <HI>Bavaria</HI> and <HI>Lorrain,</HI> being followed by many other Princes and Lords, and &s;aluted with three Vollies of all the Cannon and Mu&s;queteers of the Army. After Ma&s;s, the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Strigonium</HI> read with a loud Voice the Bull of Indulgence, accorded to &s;uch who &s;hould fight again&s;t Infidels, and ha|ving given his Benediction to their Imperial Maje&s;ties, who received it on their Knees, and con&s;equently to all the Army, this Prince cau|&s;ed 500000 Livers to be di&s;tributed among&s;t the Souldiery, which was no le&s;s acceptable to them. The Command of the Forces being given to the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> as Generali&s;&s;imo, the Right wing was conducted by the Duke of <HI>Sax-Lawenburg,</HI> the Left by General <HI>Caprara,</HI> and the Infantry and Cannon by the Count of <HI>Starenberg.</HI> With this Army thus compo&s;ed mo&s;t of the Empe|rour's old and be&s;t Souldiery, and under &s;o ex|pert a General as the Duke of <HI>Lorrain;</HI> the Court hoped for &s;omewhat extraordinary, though as it will appear they were di&s;appointed in their Ex|pectation. In the mean time a Council of War was held to &s;ee what might be done before the arrival of the Turks, and after what manner they &s;hould act upon the Defen&s;ive when the Enemy did appear. All agreed that for the Offen&s;ive there was nothing to be attempted but <HI>Gran</HI> or <HI>Newhau&s;el,</HI> and that, as they ought to avoid tho&s;e Enterpri&s;es which would co&s;t much Blood, and weaken the Army, &s;o they &s;eemed to point at <HI>Gran</HI> as mo&s;t ea&s;ie, though others were for <HI>Newhau&s;el</HI> for &s;everal Rea&s;ons.

<P>The Army being advanced near <HI>Comorra,</HI> the Duke having no certain Intelligence of the con|dition of <HI>Gran,</HI> re&s;olved in per&s;on to take a view of the Place, which he did, but being upon the point to re&s;olve its Siege, he was adverti&s;ed that the Turks were forming a Camp at <HI>Buda,</HI> and judging that they might from thence relieve <HI>Gran</HI> by Water, (as the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Newhau&s;el</HI> had already done upon the news of the Chri&s;tians De&s;ign to attempt the place) and perhaps cut off the Communication betwixt him and <HI>Comor|ra,</HI> by po&s;ting them&s;elves betwixt this Place and <HI>Gran,</HI> he quitted the thoughts of that Enterpri&s;e, re&s;olving upon the Siege of <HI>Newhau&s;el</HI> as the on|ly choice left him.</P>

<P>Whil&s;t the two Armies did nothing material, but ob&s;erve each other, a great Body of <HI>Tartars</HI> under the Conduct of their Cham, who was there in Per&s;on, animated with the hopes of Pil|lage, having examined the Avenues and Fords of the River <HI>Raab,</HI> by following it towards its &s;ource, pa&s;&s;ed over by &s;wimming their Hor|&s;es, and guided by &s;ome <HI>Hungarians,</HI> they came to <HI>Kerment</HI> and St. <HI>Godthard,</HI> a place famous for the memorable Victory which the Chri&s;tians gained from the Turks nineteen years pa&s;t, far from finding any Ob&s;tacles to hinder them, eve|ry thing &s;eem'd to favour their Pa&s;&s;age. Count <HI>Badiani</HI> abandoned his po&s;t upon the River, joyn|ing with <HI>Tekely</HI> tho&s;e <HI>Hungarians</HI> he command|ed; &s;o that the Enemy entered the Country like a torrent, putting all to Fire and Sword; and pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Rabwitz,</HI> continued their Deva&s;tati|ons. The Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> finding the Enemy on both &s;ides, and fearing le&s;t they might cut off his way to <HI>Vienna</HI> and the Hereditary Coun|tries, having reinforced the Gari&s;ons of <HI>Raab</HI> and <HI>Comorra,</HI> re&s;olved to retire with the re&s;t not exceeding 24000. And to the end the march of the Hor&s;e might not be retarded by the Foot and Artillery, they were &s;eparated, the Infan|try and Canon marching along the I&s;le of <HI>Schut,</HI> the way on the left &s;ide of the <HI>Danube,</HI> being ex|po&s;ed to little Danger; from thence they came &s;afe to <HI>Presburg</HI> and <HI>Thebes,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ing the Ri|ver <HI>Mark,</HI> arrived happily at <HI>Vienna.</HI> The Duke, having pa&s;&s;ed the Bridge of <HI>Raab</HI> with the Ca|valry, marched to <HI>Altembourg,</HI> where he re&s;ted &s;ome time, expo&s;ing this little Town to the Pillage of his Souldiers, as being loth to let their Cattel and Provi&s;ions fall into the Enemies Hands, which would infallibly happen. The Inhabitants however &s;eemed very di&s;&s;atisfied to be &s;o u&s;ed by their Friends, though the Cru|elty of the Enemy, who ravaged all with Fire and Sword, effaced the other ill, as wholly di&s;|proportionable: from thence having pa&s;&s;ed the Streight there, they marched towards the Plains of <HI>Kitz</HI> or <HI>Kitzer,</HI> where two Months before the general review of the Army was made.</P>
<P><HI>Cara Mu&s;tapha,</HI> the Great Vi&s;ier, attributing this retreat of the Chri&s;tians to their fear, cal|led a Council, where it was deliberated whether he &s;hould pur&s;ue them, or undertake the Siege of <HI>Raab?</HI> But judging, according to the appear|ances, that their retreat was no better than a run|ing away, it was re&s;olved to pur&s;ue them; whereupon he pre&s;ently rai&s;ed his Camp, and followed the way the Chri&s;tians were gone, leaving a body of 12000 near the &s;aid <HI>Raab,</HI> to &s;ecure his Convoys and Provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>The Duke perceiving their de&s;ign, and not judging him&s;elf in affurance in the Plains of <HI>Kitz</HI> again&s;t &s;o formidable a power, re&s;olved to march towards <HI>Vienna.</HI> He &s;ent Count <HI>Aeneas Caprara,</HI> General of his Hor&s;e, to acquaint the Emperour with it, and inform him of all things. The Duke following, had &s;ent his Baggage be|fore, but it happened, that a Troop of <HI>Tartars,</HI> mingled with <HI>Turks,</HI> and conducted by <HI>Hunga|rians,</HI> to the number of 3000 in all, having &s;wum over the River <HI>Leithe,</HI> and hid them&s;elves in a Wood betwixt the Villages of <HI>Petronel</HI> and <HI>Elend,</HI> fell &s;uddenly upon them, and attacking &s;ome Regiments on the left Wing, which fol|lowed the Baggage, with dreadful cryes and howlings, did &s;o &s;urprize them with the terrour of &s;o unexpected an irruption, that it brought them all into confu&s;ion, and by rea&s;on of the Du&s;t, which was &s;o thick that they could not di&s;tingui&s;h Friend from Foe, not knowing which way to turn, they broke their Ranks, and communicated their Di&s;order to the very Regiments that followed. In the mean time the&s;e <HI>Barbarians,</HI> taking the ordinary Advanta|ges of their impetuou&s;ne&s;s, flew &s;ome of them upon the <HI>Pedees,</HI> Carters, and Servants, which they &s;acrifice to their Cruelty and Fury, whil&s;t the re&s;t plunder the Chariots and Baggage. Ma|ny Officers lo&s;t there their Equipages, and a|mong&s;t others the Duke of <HI>Saxon-Lawenburg,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Croy,</HI> and <HI>Aeneas Caprara,</HI> all General Officers, had all their Plate taken away.</P>
<P>This Accident put the Army into a prodigi|ous Con&s;ternation, it could not be comprehend|ed, that the Duke having left the Enemy be|hind him, this &s;ame Enemy &s;hould po&s;&s;ibly have got before them, and by ways nearer and &s;hort|er intercept, and &s;o boldly attack their Baggage, which was thought &s;ecure under the Convoy that guarded it. As &s;oon as they had recollect|ed them&s;elves, and that the Duke had con&s;ider|ed the di&s;order part of his Army was in, he &s;ent fre&s;h Troops to &s;econd the fir&s;t, and to a&s;|&s;i&s;t them to repell the <HI>Barbarians;</HI> yet &s;o as to avoid a general Engagement, which he great|ly apprehended. The <HI>Tartars</HI> &s;eeing the <HI>Chri&s;ti|ans</HI> rally, began likewi&s;e to draw to a head; but the fear to &s;ee them&s;elves deprived of their Prey, obliged them to retire, and to run away with no le&s;s precipitation and &s;peed than they u&s;ed in their On&s;et. The Duke cau&s;ed them to be pur&s;ued by his Light-Hor&s;e, who took &s;ome Standards, being unwilling to engage with the gro&s;s of their Troops, as well being this Detach|ment was &s;upported by the Avant-guard of the Army, as not to retard his march to <HI>Vienna,</HI> the which he continned afterwards without any In|terruption. The <HI>Chevalier</HI> of <HI>Savoy,</HI> Brother to the Count of <HI>Soi&s;&s;ons,</HI> was lo&s;t in this Confu&s;ion, for being too far advanced with his Dragoons that followed him, a <HI>Tartar</HI> knock'd him from his Hor&s;e with his Sable, and thinking him dead, did alight, and heaving him cro&s;s his Saddle, with his Brea&s;t upon the Pomel, pre&s;t him &s;o there, that he brui&s;ed his Stomach. A little after, this Prince being relieved and con|ducted to <HI>Vienna,</HI> and however his Wound in his Head was not mortal, his di&s;located Stomach could not bere-&s;et, &s;o that he died in a few days.
<PB N="289" REF="141">Prince <HI>Thomas</HI> of <HI>Aremberg,</HI> and Count <HI>Mellini</HI> were &s;lain in this &s;cuffle, though the common lo&s;s of either &s;ide was not great.</P>
<P>The Emperour, being informed of the pre&s;ent State of Affairs by Count <HI>Caprara,</HI> was greatly ir|re&s;olved, not knowing what to do upon &s;o im|portant and pre&s;&s;ing an Occa&s;ion. He immedi|ately cau&s;ed his chief Mini&s;ters to be &s;ummoned to know their Sentiments, and all unanimou&s;ly coun&s;elled his Maje&s;ty to retire from <HI>Vienna.</HI> They now only deliberate what road or way he ought to take, &s;ome advi&s;ed he &s;hould go over the Mountains without pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Danube,</HI> and &s;o &s;trait to <HI>Campililium,</HI> being the &s;horte&s;t and ea&s;ie&s;t way to <HI>Lintz;</HI> but the Enemy being on the &s;ame &s;ide of the River, the other was pre|ferable, as le&s;s &s;ubject to Danger, and the vio|lent pur&s;uits of the Enemies Cavalry, who would make more way in a day, winged with the hopes of &s;uch a purcha&s;e, than the Court could make in four. This la&s;t advice being ap|proved, was ordered to be put in Execution, and all things, as far as was po&s;&s;ible in &s;uch Con|fu&s;ion, prepared for the Journey.</P>
<P>The Noi&s;e of this retreat was quickly made publick. The Waggons which arrived in Con|fu&s;ion to carry the Baggage &s;ufficiently publi&s;h|ed it, and at the &s;ame time filled the City and Neighbourhood with &s;o much Terror, that it might be thought no body would &s;tay when the Emperour was gone. All the Hor&s;es and Carts that could po&s;&s;ibly be found, were hired to fly away with, many Ladies of Quality being for|ced to put them&s;elves into de&s;picable Carriages, little conformable to their Condition. Hou&s;es &s;tored with rich moveables, and furni&s;hed with Wine, Corn, and all &s;ort of Provi&s;ions, were abandoned, nothing but what was precious and mo&s;t portative being &s;aved. The Air was al&s;o filled with the Sighs, the Tears, the Lamenta|tions and the Cryes of the Multitude, as if the Enemy had already rendered them&s;elves Ma|&s;ters of the City.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July <HI>7.</HI></NOTE> being the &s;eventh of <HI>July,</HI> about eight at Night, their Imperial Maje&s;ties with the whole Court pa&s;&s;ing through the Pal|lace Gate, went over the <HI>Danube,</HI> and lay that Night at <HI>Cronenbourg,</HI> a plea&s;ant Town two or three miles di&s;tant from <HI>Vienna,</HI> being guarded by 200 men, who returned to <HI>Vienna</HI> the next Morning. The next day there followed &s;uch a prodigious number of Coaches, Carts, Cha|riots, Hor&s;emen, Foot, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as if they had de|&s;igned to render the City a De&s;ert. They were thought to amount to 60000, &s;o pre&s;&s;ing they were to avoid the danger that &s;o eminently threatned them. And yet it was computed, that no fewer &s;tay'd behind fit to bear Arms, be&s;ides the Garri&s;on, the Women and the Children. This flight continued &s;everal days, but tho&s;e that went la&s;t, fell for the mo&s;t part into the danger they would avoid, the hands of the <HI>Tar|tars.</HI> Many others did &s;o overload their Cha|riots, that they had &s;carce pa&s;&s;ed the Bridge over the <HI>Danube,</HI> but their Wheels or Axeltrees breaking, they were left in the way in the Night, not knowing whither to turn them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>Count <HI>Aversberg,</HI> having been di&s;patched by the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> to the Emperour, to inform him of the &s;ucce&s;s of the Battel of <HI>Petronel,</HI> found him at <HI>Cronenbourg,</HI> and greatly rejoyced the whole Court. Upon the fir&s;t News of the Re|giments that had been baffled, they had publi&s;h|ed at <HI>Vienna</HI> that the General had been &s;lain, the Hor&s;e defeated, and the <HI>Tartars</HI> at the Gates of the City. Thus all were greatly revived, that the Evil was le&s;s than they had believed it to be.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t their Imperial Maje&s;ties continued their Journey to <HI>Lintz, Lorrain</HI> entred <HI>Vienna,</HI> where his fir&s;t care was to pacifie the Di&s;orders and Confu&s;ion there.<NOTE PLACE="marg">July <HI>8.</HI></NOTE> Count <HI>Sterenberg</HI> arrived there the &s;ame day, and immediately fell to work with the Counter&s;charp, fortifying the whole Works, and to plant Palizadoes. As they had not apprehended a Siege, the Generals found the more to do. <HI>Lorrain</HI> endeavoured however to provide for all things before the ar|rival of the Enemy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July <HI>11.</HI></NOTE> who began &s;ince the <HI>11th</HI> to &s;hew their mo&s;t advanced Troops near the City. The &s;ame day <HI>Starenberg</HI>'s Regiment arrived, as al&s;o a thou&s;and commanded Men, who advancing &s;wiftly before the re&s;t of the Ar|my, entred the City.</P>
<P>And now they burn the Suburbs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July <HI>12.</HI></NOTE> which was continued the day following, the Citizens them|&s;elves carrying Fire into their own Hou&s;es; and in the Evening there was a great Skirmi&s;h near the Palace called the Favorite, where the Turks advanced to di&s;cover. All the Infantry arrived the <HI>13th,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">July <HI>13.</HI></NOTE> and <HI>Lorrain</HI> made them all march in|to the Counter&s;charp, except eight Batallions which he retained in the <HI>Tabor,</HI> the better to defend that Po&s;t where he re&s;olved to &s;tay until the Powder and Bullets expected from <HI>Lintz</HI> were arrived; which being effected, and the Ammunition conducted into the Ar&s;enal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July <HI>14.</HI></NOTE> he cau&s;ed the re&s;t of the Foot to be removed into the Town, together with <HI>Dupigni</HI>'s Regiment of Hor&s;e, the whole compo&s;ing a Body of twelve thou&s;and Men.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tartars</HI> had committed infinite Ravages and Cruelties in that va&s;t extent of Countries round <HI>Vienna</HI> for &s;everal Leagues. It is their cu|&s;tom to run before the Army, armed only with a Javelin, and to burn and &s;ack, and &s;pread Terror over all where they find no re&s;i&s;tance. They kill &s;uch as fall into their Hands, or traf|fick them away as Slaves with the Turks. No place e&s;capes their Inhumanity, not the mo&s;t retired Places of Forre&s;ts, the impenetrable Dens of wild Bea&s;ts, or the mo&s;t ob&s;cure retreats of Valleys. There is nothing the&s;e <HI>Barbarians</HI> do not di&s;cover by means of their Blood-hounds, the u&s;e whereof is common amon&s;t them.</P>
<P>But now the gro&s;s of the Enemies Army ap|proaching, a great number of Waggons, &s;ome with four Hor&s;es, and others drawn with Ox|en, and very many Camels laden with Baggage, began to range them&s;elves in form of a Croy&s;ent or half Moon about the City, extending from the <HI>Danube</HI> behind St. <HI>Mark,</HI> along the Suburbs of <HI>Leopol&s;tat,</HI> and the neighbouring Villages, even to <HI>Neudorf.</HI> At the &s;ame time the Turks opened their Trenches on the &s;ide of the Imperial Gate, and lodged there in &s;pight of the Cannon of the Town that endeavoured to hinder them.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> having ordered Affairs at <HI>Vienna,</HI> retired with his Hor&s;e and Dragoons over the Bridges, and camp'd there; he would gladly have kept &s;ome Foot with him, but ha|ving con&s;idered the greatne&s;s of the Enemies Strength, the Works that were to be made, the di&s;tance of Supplies, and the diminution which the continuance of a Siege would make in the Garri&s;on, he re&s;olved to leave all his Infantry with the Governour, who mo&s;t earne&s;tly de&s;ired it.</P>
<P>The Duke, before he left <HI>Vienna,</HI> had de&s;igned to continue in the <HI>Tabor,</HI> (or I&s;le of St. <HI>Leopold</HI>) and &s;o con&s;erve the Communication with the City. <HI>Tabor</HI> is an I&s;land of a League and a half long, environed with the <HI>Danube.</HI> This I&s;le is
<PB N="290" REF="142">full of Hou&s;es of Plea&s;ure, Gardens, and Groves. But upon a true Survey of the Place, his High|ne&s;s could not think it defen&s;ible, the Waters being &s;o low, that the Arm of the River which formed this I&s;le was almo&s;t every where forda|ble, &s;o that whole &s;quadrons might pa&s;s at once without breaking their Ranks: for this and o|ther Rea&s;ons, the I&s;le being likewi&s;e expo&s;ed to the Enemies Artillery, they were obliged to re|pa&s;s the <HI>Danube.</HI></P>
<P>The Turks by this time had pitch'd an infinite number of Tents about the City, and making a lodgement in <HI>Rottenhoffs</HI> Garden, where they had fir&s;t opened their Trenches, and rai&s;ed a great Battery, they thundered without cea&s;ing to favour their Works, which they continued winding and turning. The be&s;ieged on their &s;ide covered them&s;elves with Gabions and &s;acks of Earth to hinder the effect of the Enemies Cannon; they al&s;o rai&s;ed a good Battery on that &s;ide, and all the Engineers and mo&s;t know|ing Officers being di&s;tributed into the &s;everal Po&s;ts, were continually employed to render their Cannon &s;erviceable, and fortifie the Places the mo&s;t expo&s;ed to the Enemies Fire, which co&s;t many of them their Lives,</P>
<P>The Turks, moved to &s;ee that the Chri&s;tians were Ma&s;ters of the Bridges, made an attempt to force <HI>Conte Schultz</HI> who had the guard of them. This General &s;eeing his forlorn and advanced Guards pre&s;&s;ed, he &s;ent other Troops to &s;u&s;tain them; but the Infidels having already a great body in the I&s;le of <HI>Tabor,</HI> the Chri&s;tians were forced to fly over the Bridge. The Enemy planted their Standards there, but the Cannon loaden with Cartrages flanking that place, and the &s;wift firing of the Dragoons, ranged along that Arm of the <HI>Danube,</HI> con&s;trained them to re|tire, though them&s;elves were expo&s;ed to the Enemies great and &s;mall &s;hot. The Dragoons pre&s;&s;ed them with &s;o much violence in their re|treat, that they took their Colours. The Turks upon this occa&s;ion lo&s;t a Ba&s;&s;a, and many of their Janizaries. General <HI>Schultz</HI> him&s;elf was wound|ed here, as al&s;o the <HI>Conte</HI> of <HI>Salsburg,</HI> and a <HI>Po|li&s;h</HI> Major &s;lain. In the mean time the Turks, having po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of St. <HI>Leopold</HI>'s I&s;le, &s;hut up the City on all &s;ides. They made Bridg|es upon that Arm of the <HI>Danube</HI> which runs next the City, not only to communicate with their Camp, but to hinder the de&s;cent of Boats They burnt the <HI>Favorite,</HI> and reduced all the Palaces of the Grandees to A&s;hes. As &s;oon as the heat of firing began to cea&s;e in the Suburbs, the Turks filled them with Janizaries, &s;o that none could enter or go out of the City; which much troubled the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> who could no more give or receive Intelligence from the be&s;ieged, though &s;o near and in &s;ight of them.</P>
<P>The Camp of twelve thou&s;and Men which the Grand Vi&s;ier had left near <HI>Raab</HI> to favour the Convoys, continued there &s;till under the command of the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Buda;</HI> but he was re|lieved by Prince <HI>Abaffi,</HI> being him&s;elf obliged to go to the Siege of <HI>Vienna.</HI> There was al&s;o a Camp almo&s;t always betwixt <HI>Fickem</HI> and <HI>Altem|bourg,</HI> upon the &s;ame account, that is, to keep open and a&s;&s;i&s;t the Pa&s;&s;age of Convoys which came from <HI>Buda,</HI> and the Neighbouring Parts.</P>
<P>The Turks being po&s;ted in St. <HI>&V;lrick</HI>'s Sub|urbs, run their Trenches within fifty paces of the Counter&s;charp and Batteries. They al&s;o ad|vanced their Cannon there, but before they di&s;|charged them, they cau&s;ed a little Bag of Lin|nen, carried upon the Spur by two <HI>Spahies,</HI> to be thrown into the Counter&s;charp. This con|tained a Letter from the Grand Vizier, written in the Latin and Turki&s;h Languages, the Ex|plication whereof follows.</P>

<P>The Turks continued to deepen their Tren|ches to four foot, and &s;hot many Bombs, but without any con&s;iderable effect, mo&s;t of them bur&s;ting in the Air, except &s;ome few, which falling near the Walls, burnt an old Play-hou&s;e, which being of Wood, it was feared le&s;t the Flames &s;hould reach the Convent and Church of the <HI>Augu&s;tines,</HI> which occa&s;ion'd its &s;udden demoli&s;hing.</P>
<P>There happened al&s;o another Accident, but more dangerous. The Fire having &s;eized upon the <HI>Scots</HI> Church, con&s;umed that &s;tately Build|ing, as al&s;o the Hou&s;e of <HI>Frendorf,</HI> lately perfe|ctioned by the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Heliopolis,</HI> Suffragan to the Arch-bi&s;hop of <HI>Vienna.</HI> The flame proceed|ed to the Ar&s;enal, full of Powder and Muniti|ons of War, which would have proved fatally ruinous, if <HI>Conte Serin</HI> had not cau&s;ed the Gate, which they had in vain attempted to unlock, to be broken open, and immediately removed the Powder, which a few moments delay would have rendred impo&s;&s;ible. But on the other &s;ide, they could not hinder the Fire to con&s;ume the Palaces of <HI>Aversberg, Traun,</HI> and <HI>Pal&s;i,</HI> which were reduced to A&s;hes. A Boy of &s;ixteen years old, habited like a Girl, was accu&s;ed as guilty of this burning, being found thereabouts, who was by the enraged People immediately pull'd in pieces, &s;o that the truth by this precipitated death could not be made known. This Fire continued three days, which if it had fei&s;ed the Powder in the Ar&s;enal, as in the year 1629, the
<PB N="291" REF="142">Turks might ea&s;ily have entred that way into the City.</P>
<P>Since this Accident, the Infidels &s;hot that way that they &s;aw the flame appear, and endeavour|ed to ruine the Court and the Lyon Ba&s;tions, with the Ravelin betwixt both; but the Be|&s;ieged bravely oppo&s;ed them with their Sallies and Countermines. They wanted good En|gineers in the City, in&s;omuch that <HI>Ha&s;ner,</HI> a Captain of the Garri&s;on, who from a private Souldier was by his Virtue come to that de|gree, being ob&s;erved to note all the faults the Miners committed in their Works, the conduct of them was committed to him, wherein he ac|quitted him&s;elf with good Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>Count <HI>Starenberg,</HI> who was Governour Gene|ral, was all this while bu&s;ie in repairing the Walls, deepning and palizadoing the Ditches, and in rai&s;ing the Earth which was drawn out of the Ramparts and Retreats, to cover them|&s;elves when the fir&s;t Po&s;ts and Parapets were thrown down, which afterwards contributed much to the defence of the Place.</P>
<P>The Turks advanced their Works on the Court and Lebel Ba&s;tions &s;ide, carrying them on within thirty paces of the Counter&s;charp, notwith&s;tanding the continued fire of the Be|&s;ieged. They al&s;o di&s;charged their Cannon and Mortars without cea&s;ing, and intirely ru|ined the Emperour's Palace, the Hou&s;es and neighbouring Churches.</P>
<P>Count <HI>Starenberg,</HI> who neglecting the danger, vi&s;ited every moment the Po&s;ts, to &s;ee if his or|ders were faithfully executed; upon his going out of the Court-Bulwark was hurt in the Head with a Brick-bat, which a Cannon bullet had forced. He was immediately carried to his Lodging, and &s;o happily cured, that in three days he found him&s;elf able to quit his Bed and his Chamber; during his hurt, the Count of <HI>Daun</HI> was al&s;o incapable of acting, being dange|rou&s;ly &s;ick of a violent Fever, which reduced him to extremity; &s;o that he was not out of danger before the fourteenth Day of his Mala|dy. But the Counts <HI>Serin, Souches,</HI> and <HI>Schaffen|berg,</HI> Brigadiers of the Garri&s;on, applied them|&s;elves with &s;o much care for the defence of the Place, that the Enemy drew no advantage from this misfortune.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> find|ing him&s;elf obliged to remove farther from the City, his fir&s;t care was to mole&s;t the Enemy. Count <HI>Dunewald,</HI> Lieut. Mar&s;hal of the Field, was &s;ent to <HI>Krembs</HI> with his Regiment, the two Re|ments of <HI>Lodron,</HI> and <HI>Keri, Cravats, Kemg&s;egs</HI> Re|giment of <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Dragoons, were likewi&s;e di|&s;patched thither, not only to keep the Bridge, which was of great Importance, but to hinder the Enemies Forragers, and oppo&s;e the Parties of <HI>Tartars</HI> which ravaged about. And here we may wonder at the Politicks of the&s;e Mi&s;|creants, who burn and ruine all the Forrages, and all the Victuals, which &s;hould make them &s;ub&s;i&s;t, and which would have very much ac|commoded their Army in the di&s;tre&s;&s;es they af|terwards found them&s;elves.</P>
<P><HI>Lorrain</HI> likewi&s;e &s;ent Orders to Count <HI>Her|me&s;tein,</HI> who was in <HI>Styria,</HI> to advance to the Frontiers on the &s;ide of the Mountains, to at|tempt the Enemies. He gave al&s;o the &s;ame Orders to the Garri&s;ons of <HI>Raab</HI> and <HI>Comorra,</HI> and to <HI>Ca&s;tel</HI>'s Dragoons who were at <HI>New&s;tat.</HI> He &s;ent likewi&s;e to &s;urvey <HI>Clo&s;terneubourg,</HI> which is an Abbey upon the <HI>Danube.</HI> The Turki&s;h Camp was but two Leagues off, and according to the report made to him of the Place, he judged it nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;erve this Po&s;t, which he did, by putting Foot into it, the which might de&s;cend the <HI>Danube</HI> upon occa&s;ion, if the Enemy came to attack them with Cannon.</P>
<P>He di&s;patch'd an Officer to <HI>Raab,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">July <HI>17.</HI></NOTE> for the Re|giments of <HI>Grana</HI> and <HI>Baden,</HI> which the Duke of <HI>Croy</HI> brought him with &s;o much diligence, that parting from <HI>Raab</HI> at Mid-night, they came in 24 hours to <HI>Presburg,</HI> and the next day to the Camp.</P>
<P>Count <HI>Le&s;ley</HI> was &s;ent to <HI>Krembs</HI> to conduct the Artillery thither, and to expect the <HI>Bavarians</HI> Au|xiliaries, tho&s;e of <HI>Saxony</HI> and <HI>Franconia,</HI> and &s;ome other loo&s;e Regiments in the Empire.</P>
<P>After the&s;e fir&s;t Di&s;po&s;itions, which depen|ded on the Duke's care, his thoughts more near|ly regarded the Court, and the relief of <HI>Vienna.</HI> He judged the &s;afety of this Place of &s;uch Im|portance, that he thought it not fit it &s;hould be pre&s;&s;ed, and reduced to Extremity, to &s;earch the means of &s;aving it. He knew that the te|diou&s;ne&s;s of Negotiations, and the di&s;tance from whence he was to expect things nece&s;&s;ary for this grand Enterpri&s;e, would make him lo&s;e much time, whence he concluded that he could not begin too &s;oon. He was not of the Senti|ment of others, who imagined that the Garri|&s;on of <HI>Vienna</HI> was capable of defending it &s;elf again&s;t &s;uch extraordinary Troops, and cau&s;e the Grand Vi&s;ier's Army to peri&s;h, without any Succour. But he knew that the want of Nece&s;|&s;aries do &s;ometimes produce great Changes in the be&s;t Re&s;olutions, that no body could an&s;wer for the Governour's Life; nor for the principal Officers, nor for the con&s;tancy of the People, accu&s;tomed to an ea&s;ie Life, and who had ne|ver &s;een the Wars but in paint. He knew that the Maladies inevitable in Sieges might occa&s;i|on untoward Accidents. He &s;aw the De&s;olation of the Emperour's Hereditary Countries, which did daily augment. He heard no other Di&s;|cour&s;e but of Places &s;acked, and People carried into &s;lavery. In this Continuation of Cruelties and Violences, he judged it rea&s;onable to u&s;e all means to &s;top the Rapidity of this Torrent. He per&s;waded him&s;elf, that being at the head of the Army, he ought not to deferr repre&s;enting all the&s;e Particulars to the Emperour by &s;ome Per&s;on of Merit and Tru&s;t. He gave this Com|mi&s;&s;ion to Count <HI>Taff,</HI> whom he di&s;patch'd to <HI>Ha&s;&s;au,</HI> and he continued the &s;ame Offices during the Siege, for all the Ob&s;tacles and Oppo&s;itions which he Encountred, whether by the Difficul|ties of Pa&s;&s;ages, or the &s;lender &s;ucce&s;s of his Ne|gotiations.</P>
<P>The Be&s;iegers, who had drawn two parallel Lines, the one on the Court Ba&s;tion, and the other on the Lebel &s;ide, joyned them with another of Communication, and placed above thirty pieces of Battery again&s;t them. And though <HI>Vienna</HI> was environed with eleven Ba&s;ti|ons, the Enemy attack'd and battered but three during the whole Siege, which obliged the Go|vernour to u&s;e all his care for their defence.</P>
<P>The Grand Vi&s;ier took his Po&s;t on that &s;ide that regarded the Ravelin above-mentioned, with the Aga of the Janizaries, called as he was, <HI>Cara Mu&s;tapha,</HI> his <HI>Kiaia,</HI> and the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Rome|lia;</HI> this la&s;t was &s;lain with a Cannon bullet. The Attack on the right &s;ide towards the Court Bulwark was committed to <HI>Hu&s;&s;an,</HI> the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Damas,</HI> who, though brave, had been bea|ten by Prince <HI>Ragotzki</HI> in <HI>Tran&s;ilvania,</HI> by Count <HI>Souches</HI> at <HI>Lewentz,</HI> and by the King of <HI>Poland</HI> at <HI>Cocczin.</HI> This Ba&s;&s;a was &s;econded by the Sera&s;|quier, Jani&s;ary Aga, or Collonel of all the Foot.</P>
<P><HI>Achmet,</HI> Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Temi&s;war,</HI> commanded the left Attack towards the Lebel Bulwark. He had been <HI>Tefterdar,</HI> and died the Third of <HI>September</HI> of a Dy&s;&s;entery. <HI>Hu&s;&s;an</HI> Ba&s;&s;a, who had al&s;o been his Highne&s;&s;es Trea&s;urer, was put in his Place.</P>

<P>Great was the firing on both &s;ides, and a Gra|nado falling on the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;adors Palace, rever&s;ed all his Stables.

<P>Being, as we mentioned, clo&s;e &s;hut up, <HI>Count, Sta|renberg</HI> was the more de&s;irous to communicate Councils with the Duke of <HI>Lorrain;</HI> for which end he offered 100 Duckets to any that would but carry him a Letter, without the hazard of a return, but no man pre&s;ented him&s;elf upon this occa&s;ion; and yet a Spy &s;ent by the Duke arrived happily in the City, having traver&s;ed the four Branches of the <HI>Danube</HI> with his Letters hanged in a Bladder about his Neck; by the&s;e the Governour was informed, that he &s;hould certainly be relieved, and that the Troops of the Circles of the Empire, and the Hereditary Countries with which the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> who was at <HI>Olmitz,</HI> was to joyn, did daily arrive. In the mean time &s;ome De&s;erters brought News, and it was &s;een from the top of St. <HI>Stevens</HI> Stee|ple, that the Infidels were making a Bridge of Boats over the <HI>Danube,</HI> a League off, to the end they might pa&s;s when they plea&s;ed into the I&s;le of <HI>Prater.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Leopol&s;tat.</NOTE> They knew al&s;o that this Commi&s;&s;i|on was given to the Vayvods of <HI>Wallachia</HI> and <HI>Moldavia,</HI> who employed 6000 of their Nation in the Work; but being the Turks &s;u&s;pected them, as being Chri&s;tians, and that they were forced, the Vi&s;ier ordered <HI>Achmet,</HI> Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Mag|ne&s;ia,</HI> a City in Natolia, who was camped in this I&s;le, and <HI>Chider,</HI> Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Bo&s;na,</HI> who had been <HI>Kiaia</HI> to the Sultana <HI>A&s;&s;eki,</HI> to attend their Acti|ons, and &s;econd them with &s;ix thou&s;and <HI>Egyp|tians.</HI></P>
<P>The Baron of <HI>Kunitz,</HI> who was the Empe|rours Re&s;ident with the Port, being then in the Camp, &s;ent one of his Dome&s;ticks with a Letter to Count Starenberg, which was not very hard to do, though the Turks kept a very &s;trict Guard, by rea&s;on that the Officers and Servants of all the Mini&s;ters which re&s;ided with the Grand Seignior, are habited as Turks, and &s;peak the Language of the Country. The bu&s;i|ne&s;s was kept &s;o little &s;ecret, that the News be|came the next day the &s;ubject of every Conver|&s;ation. This Indi&s;cretion was the cau&s;e that they could no more profit by this Advantage, the Turks being adverti&s;ed of this Commerce by their Spies. <HI>Kunitz</HI>'s Servant being &s;ei&s;ed up|on in his return, was brought to the Vi&s;ier, and &s;een no more, but without his Letters, which be|ing wrap'd in wax, he prudently let &s;lip into a Ditch, when he &s;aw the Turks come towards him.</P>
<P>An Order was publi&s;hed by &s;ound of Trum|pet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July <HI>25.</HI></NOTE> commanding all Proprietors of Hou&s;es, to keep every one a Man in his Cellar, to hear|ken if they could not di&s;cern any thumping or removing of Earth, becau&s;e it had been noi&s;|ed abroad, that &s;ome Traitors had promi&s;ed to bring the Enemy through Subterranean Pa&s;&s;a|ges into the City. The &s;ame day the Turks pa&s;&s;ing &s;ome great Pieces into <HI>Leopol&s;tat</HI> upon Boats and Flotes, were di&s;covered by the be|&s;ieged, who play'd upon them with their Can|non from the Ramparts &s;o lukily, that they &s;unk two of their large&s;t, with a Mortarpiece, which yet did not hinder the re&s;t to arrive at <HI>Neudorf</HI> and <HI>Erdorf.</HI></P>
<P>The Cannon on both &s;ides, together with the Mortars, play'd without cea&s;ing, and though they ruined the prime Buildings in the Town, they hurt or killed but very few. The <HI>24th, Ni|tiski,</HI> one of the Engineers, came in great ha&s;te to the Governour, to tell him, that he had &s;een in one of the Shores of the City, &s;omewhat that had the Figure of a Man, and that it was to be feared, that the Turks had found a Pa&s;&s;age, and were entered through this Vault, which di&s;gor|ges it &s;elf in the <HI>Danube,</HI> and that they de&s;igned to &s;urpri&s;e the City that way. The Governour, not being yet well recovered of his hurt, &s;ent <HI>Nit|ski</HI> back, with the Baron of <HI>Wels,</HI> his Son-in-Law, and Collonel <HI>Rumblingen,</HI> who was pre&s;ent, to examine the matter with care; but being they &s;tayed &s;omewhat long, the Governour, weak as he was, mounted on Hor&s;eback. Being come to the place, he alighted, and entered him&s;elf, notwith&s;tanding the infectious &s;mells, into the hole, having &s;earched all about with Torches, he found that they were Carka&s;&s;es that the Ex|ecutioners men had flead. He very &s;harply re|proved the Authors of this Inhumanity, having accidentally met &s;ome of them, and returned to his Palace, plea&s;antly rallying this Pannick fear with tho&s;e that accompanied him.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> had continued in his Camp by the Bridges of <HI>Vienna</HI> to refre&s;h his hara&s;&s;ed Cavalry, from the <HI>16th</HI> to the <HI>25th</HI> of <HI>July.</HI> He had there News of the defeat of 800 <HI>Tartars</HI> by a party of a Detachment which Count <HI>Dunewald</HI> Commanded, which render'd the&s;e <HI>Barbarians</HI> more re&s;erved.</P>
<P>The Count <HI>de la Tour,</HI> the Emperours Envoy in <HI>Poland,</HI> came to the &s;ame Po&s;t to him, to a&s;|&s;ure him, that that Prince promi&s;ed to come to the relief of <HI>Vienna,</HI> but that he could not be there before the beginning of <HI>September.</HI></P>
<P>At the &s;ame time the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> was ad|verti&s;ed that <HI>Tekely</HI> having a&s;&s;embled his Troops near <HI>Tirnau,</HI> de&s;igned to march to <HI>Presburg,</HI> that the Governour of that Ca&s;tle wavered, and that the City was much &s;ollicited to receive a Garri&s;on of the di&s;contented <HI>Hungarians;</HI> which obliged him to march along the <HI>Marck</HI> to oppo&s;e this de&s;ign, and in the interim he &s;ent 200 men with Major <HI>Okelby,</HI> to endeavour to put them in|to the &s;aid Ca&s;tle with a Convoy of 300 Hor&s;e for his Security.</P>
<P>The Duke di&s;camp'd from the Bridges of <HI>Vienna,</HI> having burnt them, leaving notwith|&s;tanding the Regiments of <HI>Savoy</HI> and <HI>Ricardi</HI> to pre&s;erve the Forts. Being arrived at the <HI>Mark,</HI> he was informed that <HI>Okelby</HI> with his Convoy were beaten by a party of the <HI>Malecontents;</HI> that the City had received a Garri&s;on; that they were by order of the Grand Vi&s;ier preparing a Bridge for the Communication of both Armies; that <HI>Tekely</HI> had 20000 <HI>Hungarians,</HI> and 8000 <HI>Turks,</HI> commanded by the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Waradin</HI> and <HI>Pe&s;t;</HI> and that he prepared to come and be&s;iege the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Presburg.</HI> This de&s;ign appeared to the Duke of that con&s;equence, that he believed him&s;elf obliged to march thither notwith&s;tand|ing all the Ob&s;tacles that &s;eemed to oppo&s;e him. This re&s;olve was however a great while conte|&s;ted. He con&s;idered the difficulty of the ways, the Enemies Forces much &s;uperior to his; the danger of receiving a check, in a time when the
<PB N="293" REF="143">Emperours Forces were to be pre&s;erved for re|lief of <HI>Vienna.</HI> On the other &s;ide, he fore&s;aw that the Communication of the two Armies at <HI>Pres|burg</HI> did put the Enemies in a Condition to joyn their Forces to pa&s;s where they plea&s;ed, and to hinder the Conjunction of the Arms of <HI>Poland,</HI> or oblige them to tedious Circuits. The&s;e Con|&s;iderations made him determine to oppo&s;e the De&s;igns of <HI>Tekely.</HI> He traver&s;ed the <HI>Marck</HI> the <HI>28th</HI> of <HI>July</HI> with his Hor&s;e and Dragoons, be|ing in all eight thou&s;and Hor&s;e, and two thou|&s;and <HI>Poles,</HI> commanded by <HI>Lubomirsky.</HI> A party that appeared a League from the River, was forced back, the Imperiali&s;ts continuing their march to the Lanes that de&s;cended to <HI>Presburg.</HI> Night being come on, Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Baden,</HI> and the Baron <HI>Mercy</HI> were detached with all the Dragoons to force the narrow Pa&s;&s;ages, and gain the tops of the Vineyards, which they did with|out any Oppo&s;ition, having a &s;ight of the Enemy in the plain below. The General upon no|tice came &s;peedily there, from whence he ob&s;er|ved two Camps po&s;ted at &s;ome di&s;tance from each other. He cau&s;ed his Hor&s;e to advance, which he had left behind the narrow Pa&s;&s;ages, to be ready upon Occa&s;ion, and in the mean time cau&s;ed <HI>Okelby</HI> to enter the Ca&s;tle with two hundred Men, commanded a-new for this Enter|pri&s;e.</P>
<P>At break of day, the General commanded Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Baden</HI> to in&s;pect the Suburbs, where &s;ome Malecontents did appear. Upon his advance, the Enemy retreated into the City, and abandoned the &s;aid Suburbs without re&s;i&s;t|ance.</P>
<P>This happy Succe&s;s, and that in &s;ight of the Enemy, &s;eemed an Argument of their Weak|ne&s;s, and occa&s;ioned the &s;ummoning of the Town, which, in the Surpri&s;e it was, &s;eeing the Imperial Army at their Gates, and the Garri|&s;on of the Ca&s;tle reinforced, immediately &s;ur|rendred, deliberating no longer than was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to give means to the Garri&s;on of the Malecontents to retire to their Camp; which did not happen, for one part of them was cut in pieces when they were out, and the other made Pri&s;oners in the Town.</P>
<P>After this advantage, the Duke was re&s;olved to attack the Enemy, who were advanced in Batalia within three quarters of an hour of the City. He gave Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Baden</HI> Orders to &s;ei&s;e with his Dragoons the Vineyards and Gar|dens at the head of the Suburbs, and to extend on both hands from the <HI>Danube</HI> to the foot of the Mountain; whil&s;t the Hor&s;e, commanded by Count <HI>Caprara,</HI> de&s;cended by the &s;ame Vineyards to embattel them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The Enemy on their &s;ide made &s;ome moti|ons of coming up to the Imperiali&s;ts, and de|tached &s;ome Parties to begin the Skirmi&s;h; but the Duke would not Engage them before all his Troops were in Battel-array. As &s;oon as the &s;e|cond Line was formed, they began to advance; which occa&s;ioned the Malecontents to change their Countenance, for whereas they had ap|peared, as if de&s;igning to bring the bu&s;ine&s;s to a Battel, much Du&s;t appeared in the Rear of their right Wing, as al&s;o the left, and removed far|ther off, which &s;eemed to be occa&s;ioned by re|tiring Troops, which al&s;o proved &s;o; all the Line which &s;tood oppo&s;ite to the Imperiali&s;ts, wheeling and &s;eparating into a perfect Re|treat.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who were on the <HI>Lorrainers</HI> right, and had a Party of <HI>Polanders</HI> in oppo&s;ition to them, finding them&s;elves pre&s;&s;ed by their A|yantguard were intirely routed, being cha&s;ed with con&s;iderable lo&s;s, until they had gained a Wood, and pa&s;&s;ed a Brook two miles off, they there rallied on the other &s;ide, and obliged the Troops that had pre&s;&s;ed them to a &s;tand. On the left, another detachment of <HI>Poles,</HI> &s;econd|ed by &s;ome <HI>German</HI> Squadrons, and the Regi|ment of <HI>Palfi,</HI> charged the Enemy with &s;o much Vigour, that having broken them, they kill'd and took betwixt five and &s;ix hundred of them. They &s;ei&s;ed on above a thou&s;and Waggons with Baggage, and pur&s;ued them towards <HI>Tirnau</HI> with &s;o much heat, that they forced &s;ome of them with great Confu&s;ion into the Woods, and others in|to the <HI>Danube.</HI> The fear was &s;uch, that they fled on all &s;ides until they had pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Waagh.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tekely,</HI> upon the Advice he had of the march of the Imperiali&s;ts, by the Party he had beaten the Night before, he retired in the Night with the greate&s;t part of his Hor&s;e and all his Foot, leaving but few of his Men with the Turks, who would retire as he did, re&s;olving to expect the <HI>Germans.</HI> This Action produced &s;ome mi&s;|under&s;tanding betwixt the <HI>Tekeli&s;ts</HI> and the <HI>In|fidels,</HI> who &s;eparated with little &s;atisfaction from each other; but they re-united since by order of the Grand Vi&s;ier, as was found by their in|tercepted Letters. The Duke in the mean time cau&s;ed the Timber, the Planks, and the Boats prepared for the Con&s;truction of the de&s;igned Bridge to be de&s;troyed; and afterwards returned to the <HI>Marck.</HI></P>
<P>The Siege, <MILESTONE N="26"> in the mean time, as al&s;o the de|fence was bravely carried on; one Day the Turks diverti&s;ed them&s;elves with a con&s;ort of Flutes, Cymbals, and other In&s;truments of their Fa&s;hion, and the terrible howlings of the A&s;&s;i|&s;tants, which they account Melodious, deno|ting, as was &s;uppo&s;ed by their joy, &s;ome extra|ordinary Fea&s;t. The Be&s;ieged that were in the Counter&s;charp, but ten Paces off, could not forbear rallying the&s;e <HI>Barbarians,</HI> and ask them in &s;corn to give them part in the Diverti&s;e|ment of their Ball, being they had given them that of their Mu&s;ick. And the Ball did truly follow, but the Leapers were on the Chri&s;tians &s;ide: For the&s;e Infidels having &s;prung a Mine, which they had newly dug, under the Po&s;ts and Pallizadoes of the Counter&s;charp, the Earth, with a good part of the Pallizado, and about ten of the Defendants were blown up, The Turks taking advantage of the Opportu|nity, u&s;ed all their might to render them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the Counter&s;charp, by the breach they had made in it. The Fight was hot, and the Slaughter great. The Confu&s;ion and Di&s;|order grew high, but mo&s;t among&s;t the Chri|&s;tians, which being perceived by Count <HI>Serini,</HI> and St. <HI>Croix,</HI> Lieutenant Collonel to <HI>Dupigni,</HI> they ran with a hundred Men to their Aid, and employing them to throw hand Granadoes, and other artificial Fires upon the Enemy, &s;o encouraged their Friends, that they fell with revived Courage upon the Enemy, beat them back and kill'd a great number of them, plan|ting the Heads of the &s;lain in rows upon their Pallizadoes, letting the&s;e <HI>Barbarians</HI> know that Chri&s;tian Walls would not tumble with noi&s;e of In&s;truments and &s;howting, as the Walls of <HI>Je|rico</HI> once did.</P>
<P>A Me&s;&s;enger being &s;ent to the Duke of <HI>Lor|rain</HI> a &s;econd time with Letters in Cyfer, was unhappily taken by the Turk, and his Letters being tyed to an Arrow, were &s;hot again into the Town, with Latin lines affixed to them, intimating, that they &s;ent this Letter to the Be|&s;ieged, being it was to no purpo&s;e to &s;end it to <HI>Lorrain;</HI> being a&s;&s;ured, that in the ill Conditi|on

<P>The Governour publi&s;hed an Ordinance, <MILESTONE N="27"> whereby all Per&s;ons, of what Quality or Condi|tion &s;oever they were, being able to bear Arms, and had not yet li&s;ted them&s;elves in the Compa|nies of the Univer&s;ity, or tho&s;e of the Magi|&s;trates, &s;hould appear at the New-Market upon the noi&s;e of the Bells, to be inrolled, and form a fourth Body, which was done; In the mean time, many Chri&s;tians taken by the <HI>Tartars,</HI> being &s;haved, and in Turki&s;h habits, found means to &s;ave them&s;elves, and e&s;cape into the City.</P>
<P>The Turks continued their Labours, and the Advancement of their Works; and to hin|der the Effect of the Bombs which were continu|ally thrown out of the City, they covered their Trenches with great Beams and Trees, upon which they threw Sacks of Earth in abundance, which not only clo&s;ed the chinks, but rendred it proof again&s;t Granadoes, as al&s;o Musket &s;hot. When this Work was fini&s;hed, not only the principal Ba&s;&s;aes, but the Vi&s;ier him&s;elf came to view the Trenches, and lodged in them, ha|ving their &s;eparate Apartments, pav'd with Brick, and divided into Chambers, with all the conveniencies of great Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>There arrived an Expre&s;s in the Camp,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. <HI>1.</HI></NOTE> which informed the Duke, that the King of <HI>Po|land</HI> would not part from <HI>Cracovia</HI> till the <HI>16th</HI> In&s;tant; that the Troops of <HI>Saxony</HI> would have their Rendezvous at <HI>Dre&s;den</HI> the <HI>4th,</HI> and that tho&s;e of <HI>Frankonia,</HI> would not begin to march before the <HI>11th:</HI> The&s;e Succours appearing re|mote, and the duration of the Defence of <HI>Vienna</HI> incertain, his Highne&s;s re&s;olved to approach the Enemies Quarters. He thought that he &s;hould be able by the Twentieth of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> with his Forces, as well <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> as <HI>Bavarians,</HI> and the Troops of <HI>Polanders</HI> which &s;hould en|ter into <HI>Sile&s;ia;</HI> to pa&s;s the <HI>Daunbe</HI> at <HI>Krembs,</HI> and advance with that Body towards the Heights near the Camp of the Enemies, with de&s;ign to maintain him&s;elf there till the arri|val of the Allies. During this, he might wea|ry out the Infidels, animate the Be&s;ieged in their Defence, and hold him&s;elf in a Condition to force a Po&s;t for the relief of the Place, ac|cording to the nece&s;&s;ity of Affairs. He &s;ent Count <HI>Palfi</HI> to Court, to acquaint his Imperial Maje&s;ty with the De&s;ign, and pre&s;s the march of the Troops, which might be got together by that time; and &s;ome other di&s;po&s;al of Boats and Provi&s;ions nece&s;&s;ary for that Expedition.</P>
<P>After he had di&s;patch'd the Count, he was informed, that Count <HI>Tekely</HI> had &s;ent Boats to the Turks, that he had pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Danube,</HI> and that they were &s;een from <HI>Ent&s;erdorff,</HI> a little Town &s;eated upon that River where the Im|periali&s;ts had &s;ome Magazins. The Duke marched thither with four Regiments, and thence to the Bridge of <HI>Vienna,</HI> where, having learned that the Enemy had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them|&s;elves of a &s;mall I&s;land, and that they had taken Boats from the Pea&s;ants, who had retired into the &s;aid I&s;le, he ordered the Baron of <HI>Mercy</HI> to di&s;lodge them thence, and returned to <HI>Ent&s;er|dorff. Mercy</HI> cau&s;ed his Cannon to advance up|on the oppo&s;ite &s;hoar to the I&s;le, with the Dra|goons of <HI>Savoy</HI> which guarded the Bridge, and having broken the&s;e Boats with his great Shot, he reduced the Turks to an Inability of being able to get out of the <HI>Tabor</HI> or <HI>Leopold</HI>'s I&s;le.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as <HI>Tekely</HI> under&s;tood that the Impe|riali&s;ts were returned towards <HI>Vienna,</HI> he &s;um|moned <HI>Moravia</HI> to pay him Contribution. The Duke being adverti&s;ed of it, returned to <HI>Ancren</HI> upon the <HI>Mark,</HI> to defend that Province again&s;t the <HI>Malecontents.</HI> He was informed upon his arrival there, that a party of them had repa&s;|&s;ed that River that day, and burnt &s;ome Vil|lages. He detached pre&s;ently 500 <HI>Polanders</HI> to pur&s;ue them, &s;econding them with &s;ome Hor&s;e and Dragoons, who encountering them two Leagues from <HI>Ancren,</HI> loaden with Spoyl, they attack'd them &s;o briskly, though far inferior in number, that they killed 500, relea&s;ed the Pri|&s;oners, recovered all the Booty, and took ten or twelve of their Standards.</P>
<P>The Siege was carried on with no le&s;s brave|ry than it was &s;u&s;tained; and being &s;everal who were out of Employment were nece&s;&s;itous, an Ordinance was publi&s;hed, intimating that Monies and Provi&s;ions &s;hould be given to all &s;uch who would inroll them&s;elves, with a&s;&s;urance they &s;hould not be obliged to &s;erve after the Siege. Many accepted of the Condition, received three Patacoons each advance Moneys, and were re|galled with Bread and Wine, by the care of the Prince of <HI>Swartzenberg,</HI> and by the Liberality of the Religious and the Citizens. Wine never failed, nor indeed fre&s;h Meat for the &s;ick, &s;tore of Cattel having been twice brought in by &s;ally during the Siege. The Magi&s;trates had by the Governours Order taxed the Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks, the Cloy&s;ters, the Citizens, and the Pea&s;ants, who were refuged in the City, to furni&s;h for the u&s;e of the Souldiers the hundredth Pint, which was punctually executed, there being none that re|fu&s;ed to pay this Impo&s;ition: the greate&s;t Lords and the Emperours Officers not exempting them&s;elves upon this Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Stephens</HI> Steeple, being very obnoxious to the Turks by rea&s;on of its height, and the great extent of its Di&s;coveries, was much &s;hot at by them, though <HI>Solyman,</HI> when he be&s;ieged <HI>Vienna,</HI> had declined ruining &s;o noble a Fabrick, upon no other Terms, but that they &s;hould put a a Half Moon, the Arms of that Empire, upon the Spire of it, which was &s;till up. The Cen|tinel that was there the <HI>7th,</HI> perceived betwixt the River <HI>Mark</HI> and <HI>Moravia,</HI> on the other &s;ide the <HI>Danube,</HI> Fire and Smoke, which la&s;ted till eight a Clock; <HI>C. Starenberg</HI> judg'd they were <HI>C. Tekely</HI>'s Troops, who in pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Waagh,</HI> had skirmi&s;hed with the Imperiali&s;ts, and it proved &s;o, as he found by the return of one of his Spyes, which he had &s;ent to the Duke. The account he gave was, that the Turks having detatched 3000 Hor&s;e to di&s;cover the Succors which were arrived in the Princes Army, out of <HI>Saxony, Bavaria,</HI> and the Circles, the&s;e Infi|dels fell into an Ambu&s;cade which was laid for them, and where mo&s;t of them were cut in pie|ces; that an Aga, Count <HI>Tekely</HI>'s Secretary, and an <HI>Hungarian</HI> Count, &s;ince dead of his Wounds, were taken Pri&s;oners; that the Imperiali&s;ts had taken a great number of the Enemies Waggons with Baggage, and that &s;ince this Advantage, many of the chief of the Malecontents were come in to the Duke.</P>
<P>Collonel <HI>Hei&s;ter</HI> having pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Danube</HI> at <HI>Clo&s;ternemburg,</HI> took four hundred of the Enemies Hor&s;e. On the other &s;ide, the Malecontents con|tinued to &s;end &s;mall parties into <HI>Moravia,</HI> who &s;et fire by Night on the Hou&s;es and Villages; and as it was a hard matter to remedy the&s;e Di&s;orders by force of Arms, the Duke judged that the be&s;t way to repre&s;s them was by that of Reprizals. He cau&s;ed <HI>Tekely</HI> to be adverti&s;ed, that he would &s;end Orders to <HI>Zatmar,</HI> and to all the Emperours Garri&s;ons, to burn the Palaces and Hou&s;es of all them of his party. This
<PB N="295" REF="144">threatning put a &s;top to the&s;e Incendiaries; for he thereupon &s;ent a Per&s;on to <HI>Chevalier Labor|miski,</HI> under pretext of an Envoy to the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> to the end he might inform the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> that he had not commanded tho&s;e burn|ings, and that they &s;hould hear no more of them.</P>
<P>About this time, Count <HI>Albret Caprara,</HI> the Em|perours Envoy at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> had Permi&s;&s;ion given him by the Grand Vi&s;ier, to return to his Ma&s;ter, and having pa&s;&s;ed by <HI>Tuln,</HI> he had in charge to propo&s;e to his Imperial Maje&s;ty, that upon the Ce&s;&s;ion of <HI>Raab</HI> he would aban|don the Siege of <HI>Vienna.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Kotlinski,</HI> a Lieutenant, upon promi&s;e of the fir&s;t vacant Company, had been di&s;patched from <HI>Vienna</HI> to the Duke, one from the Depu|ties of the Council of State, and the re&s;t from the County <HI>Caplier</HI> and <HI>Starenberg.</HI> The fir&s;t, for they were of &s;everal dates, marked the danger the Counter&s;charp was in, others gave an ac|count of the &s;tate of the Siege, minding him of the Nece&s;&s;ities of the place, and the Accidents that might happen, and praying him to ha&s;ten the Succours, and the&s;e were writ by the Gover|nour. <HI>Caplier</HI>'s Letters particulariz'd the &s;lain and wounded, fini&s;hing with earne&s;tne&s;s for Relief, praying him to con&s;ider the Officers, their want of Granados, their &s;tock being near &s;pent, and the Di&s;po&s;ition of the Citizens not to be relied upon. The la&s;t Letter marked, that <HI>C. Staren|berg</HI> was &s;ick of a bloody Flux, and could an|&s;wer for nothing, unle&s;s Succours were great and quick.</P>
<P>The Duke, who was careful in informing the Emperour, the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and the Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> of all he could learn of the &s;tate of the be&s;ieged, failed not to quicken the Auxilia|ries, to communicate his Intelligence and Let|ters to them. He di&s;patch'd Count <HI>Caraffa</HI> to the King of <HI>Poland</HI> with them, and ha&s;ten'd the march of General <HI>Sinariski,</HI> who was come into <HI>Sile&s;ia</HI> &s;ix days &s;ince. This Count had al&s;o in charge, to pray his Maje&s;ty of <HI>Poland</HI> to come with the fir&s;t Troops, as well for the e&s;teem he had of his Merits, as becau&s;e he believed that upon the Kings advance the gro&s;s of his Army would follow with more diligence. After he had di&s;|patched <HI>C. Caraffa,</HI> he &s;ent the Count <HI>Schaffen|berg</HI> to the Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> to provide Wag|gons and Carriages for the Auxiliary Troops by the way as they &s;hould pa&s;s. As he did not doubt but that the&s;e pre&s;&s;ing Letters would quicken th advance of the Troops, he thought he was obliged to provide al&s;o for the pa&s;&s;age of the <HI>Danube,</HI> and in order to it re&s;olved to go to <HI>Krembs,</HI> whereof he adverti&s;ed the Emperour by an Expre&s;s. About the &s;ame time <HI>C. Starenberg</HI> had News from his Highne&s;s of the defeat of <HI>C. Tekely</HI> near <HI>Presburg,</HI> as al&s;o of the taking of a great Convoy that was going to the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Army, and that the King of <HI>Poland</HI> was upon his march to &s;uccour the Place. This good News infu&s;ed Joy into the whole City, and was wel|comed with all the Artillery, and the ringing of all their Bells. As every little Succe&s;s encourages Souldiers at lea&s;t to hope, &s;o it far'd here. A Scholar having killed a Janizary, and ripped open his Stomach, found ten Duckats in Gold in it; and a Souldier having after a &s;tiff Com|bat di&s;armed a Janizary, cut off his Head with his own Sable; Searching him afterwards, he found a Girdle about him full of Moneys, which he hid &s;o well that his Comrades did not di&s;cover it: Being returned into the City, ha|ving un&s;titch'd his purcha&s;e, he found an 100 Sequins of Gold. He was &s;o tran&s;ported at the &s;ight with Joy, that he ran like a Mad-man through the Strees, clapping his Hands, and &s;hewing his Gold to every body, making it ap|pear by his Extravagancies, that he thought him&s;elf happier than the Emperour. His good Fortune gave Courage to his Companions, upon hopes of the like Adventure, making them good Anatomi&s;ts and diligent Waiters.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> left <HI>Anneren</HI> encampt at <HI>Volgerdorp.</HI> He there received Letters from the Count <HI>Caplier</HI> and <HI>Starenberg.</HI> The fir&s;t pre&s;&s;ed &s;trongly for Relief, by rea&s;on of the Diminution of the Garri&s;on, and the Ammunitions of War. The Style of the &s;econd Letter was upon the brave, and &s;eemed of a Per&s;on not greatly con|cerned; but in the three la&s;t Lines, being in Cypher, he be&s;ought the Duke for &s;peedy Suc|cours, becau&s;e the Retrenchments and cuttings off in the Lebel Ba&s;tion were very &s;light; that his Ammunitions and Officers failed him, and that he every day lo&s;t many of his Men. His Highne&s;s return'd him an&s;wers full of comfort, adverti&s;ing him of the &s;tate of the advance of the Auxiliaries, and the certitude of his Relief. In order to it, be quits <HI>Volgerdorp,</HI> and march|ed to <HI>Stokerau,</HI> the better from thence to di&s;co|ver the I&s;les of the <HI>Danube,</HI> and chu&s;e a place for making a Bridge for his Pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>Some of the great ones were of Opinion, that <HI>Vienna</HI> ought to be relieved by the Plain, pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Danube</HI> at <HI>Presburg,</HI> this Opinion found ma|ny parti&s;ans, their rea&s;on was that the Army po&s;ting it &s;elf above the City, would cut off the Communication of the Be&s;iegers with tho&s;e Countries from whence they drew their Pro|vi&s;ions; which being done, they judged the Turks would retire, without the Chri&s;tians hazarding of a Battel. This rea&s;oning did not want appearance, if it could be done before the Be&s;ieged were too much pre&s;&s;ed; but the Enemies main force con&s;i&s;ting in Hor&s;e, that of the Imperiali&s;ts in Foot, the Duke thought Inclo&s;ures preferrable to the Plains; be&s;ides, the Allies not being able to meet at <HI>Krembs</HI> be|fore the Month of <HI>September,</HI> many days would be &s;pent in marching thence to <HI>Presburg,</HI> and laying a Bridge over the River there, in a time when the condition of the Siege deman|ded all their ha&s;te. Moreover the Con&s;tructi|on of a Bridge in that place was difficult, e&s;pe|cially if the Enemy detached any &s;trong Parties to oppo&s;e them, as they might ea&s;ily do; in|&s;omuch that the Duke, who had in the begin|ning of the Siege looked upon the Mountains of <HI>Kalemberg</HI> as the &s;ure&s;t way for the Relief of <HI>Vienna,</HI> without any farther amu&s;ing him&s;elf, re|&s;olved to pa&s;s the Army at <HI>Tuln</HI> and <HI>Krembs,</HI> di&s;|po&s;ing all things accordingly for the Execution of this De&s;ign. He did not believe the Enemy would come thither to oppo&s;e him, not only be|cau&s;e part of his Army, and of that of the <HI>Ba|varians</HI> was already on the other &s;ide of the <HI>Da|nube,</HI> and maintained them&s;elves there, with|out attempts of the <HI>Turks</HI> to di&s;lodge them; but al&s;o becau&s;e it would be dangerous for the&s;e Infi|dels to engage them&s;elves with a great Body of Hor&s;e beyond the Streights or narrow Pa&s;&s;ages of the Fore&s;t of <HI>Vienna.</HI></P>
<P>Many were the Me&s;&s;engers and Spies which pa&s;t betwixt the Duke and Be&s;ieged, his High|ne&s;s being careful to encourage and inform them. He now again a&s;&s;ures them, that the Army compo&s;ed of <HI>Bavarians, Saxons, Poles,</HI> and the Imperial Troops approach'd <HI>Krembs;</HI> That the King of <HI>Poland</HI> Commanded it in Per&s;on, and that he was accompanied by the Electors of <HI>Bavaria</HI> and <HI>Saxony;</HI> That the Emperour
<PB N="296" REF="145">was removed from <HI>Pa&s;&s;aw</HI> to <HI>Lintz,</HI> to be near|er <HI>Vienna,</HI> &s;o that now there was nothing more required for the &s;aving of Chri&s;tendom, but a little more re&s;i&s;tance, being all the Troops were ready to march. He added, that he him&s;elf was going to <HI>Krembs,</HI> to prepare the Bridges and eve|ry other nece&s;&s;ary thing, to the end that nothing &s;hould retard the Succour of the Place, a&s;&s;uring moreover the Governour, that he would expo&s;e him&s;elf to all dangers to force the Enemy from the Siege. Fortune did begin now to favour them, being <HI>Tekely</HI> had been defeated at <HI>Pres|burg,</HI> and by the River of <HI>Marcka</HI> with great lo&s;s. This News cau&s;ed a &s;en&s;ible Joy in all the Inha|bitants, and particularly the Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks, where|of many were troubled with bloody Fluxes, and very many con&s;iderable Per&s;ons had been dead of it. The cau&s;e of this Di&s;ea&s;e may well be at|tributed to the ill Diet, the riche&s;t &s;ort being forced to eat &s;alt meats, differing from the De|licacies of their former feeding, be&s;ides the Meal they made their Bread of was neither clean nor well ground.</P>
<P>The Duke in the mean time cau&s;ed &s;ome Troops of the Regiments of <HI>Grana</HI> and <HI>Baden</HI> to &s;ecure <HI>Tuln,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. <HI>22.</HI></NOTE> where there was a &s;tone Wall and a Ditch, for he de&s;igned to pre&s;erve that Town, and make it one of the heads of his Bridge: the next day he went to di&s;cover the Ilets of the <HI>Da|nube,</HI> and having found them u&s;eful for his De|&s;ign, he commanded ways to be made in them, and Boats to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">rought thither. Upon his re|turn he found Count <HI>Pal&s;i</HI> arrived from <HI>Lintz,</HI> with orders from the Emperour, that it was nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould expect the arrival of all the Allies before he approached near the Enemies.</P>
<P>About this time a noi&s;e was &s;pread in the Ci|ty, that the Turks, who ince&s;&s;antly mined and moved the Earth, had made a Subterranean pa&s;&s;age which &s;hould open into the Emperours Cellars, by which they pretended to &s;urpri&s;e the Town. The Governour, howbeit he belie|ved nothing of it, ordered the Emperours Guards which were left for the Guard of the Palace, to keep watch and Centinels in the Cellars, which they did with no great regret. The &s;ame day there happened an accident, which for the rare|ne&s;s of it may well be recorded. <HI>Kimpler,</HI> an able Engineer, working in a Countermine under the Ca&s;tle-Gate, encountered, deep in the Earth within a walled Vault,<NOTE PLACE="marg">E&s;tani.</NOTE> a Coffin of Tin, where|in he thought to have found a dead Corps, but opening it, he was dazzled with the lu&s;tre of a great many pieces of Gold and Silver, where|with this Coffin was filled; he &s;aw moreover rich Jewels enriched with precious Stones. Ha|ving &s;ecured this Trea&s;ure, he found in the bot|tom a Box of Tin, wherein was a Parchment where the following words were traced in an|cient Characters.</P>
<P>GAUDEBIS SI INVENERIS, VIDEBIS, TACEBIS, SED ORABIS, PUGNABIS, AEDIFICABIS, NON HODIE, NEC CRAS, SED QUIA UNIVERSUS EQUUS, TURRIS ERECTA ET ARMATA, DIVERSA ORDINATA ARMA SUBSCRIPTIO ROLLANDT HUNN. MOG. POSUIT.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who would divine the Sentiments of <HI>Rowland Hun</HI> of <HI>Mets,</HI> who had depo&s;ited this Trea&s;ure in the Earth, pretended he had &s;ome Knowledge of the future, and that by this In|&s;cription he would manife&s;t that he knew this Trea&s;ure would be found during the Siege of <HI>Vienna,</HI> and that the Infidels &s;hould be obliged to abandon it.

<P>Count <HI>Starenberg</HI> received new a&s;&s;urance by his Spies from the Duke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. <HI>24.</HI></NOTE> of being relieved in eight days, which cau&s;ed an univer&s;al Joy, re|doubled the Care, and augmented the Courage of all men. On the other &s;ide, the Infidels pre|pared for a general a&s;&s;ault, whil&s;t the Gover|nour on the contrary did every day invent new Engines, as <HI>Freize</HI> Hor&s;es bearded with Iron, turn'd Pikes, and the like, to oppo&s;e in the Breaches. Five hundred Hor&s;e of the Be&s;iegers pa&s;&s;ing the River, burnt &s;ome Villages, but they were encountered and defeated by a party of the Imperiali&s;ts, commanded by Collonel <HI>Hei&s;ter,</HI> who cut in pieces the greate&s;t part of them, the re&s;t endeavouring to &s;ave them&s;elves by &s;wim|ming being drowned in the River.</P>
<P>We le&s;t the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> marching to|wards <HI>Tuln,</HI> but upon advice that the <HI>Malecon|tents</HI> were de&s;igning to make Incur&s;ions into <HI>Moravia,</HI> he detach'd <HI>Lubomirski,</HI> and two Re|giments of the Emperours Hor&s;e to march to|wards the Frontiers of that Province. This Report was grounded upon the Grand Vi&s;iers Order, who upon the Knowledge he had that the Imperiali&s;ts and Auxiliaries took the way of <HI>Tuln</HI> and <HI>Krembs,</HI> had commanded Count <HI>Tekely</HI> to enter into the Hereditary Countries with Fire and Sword, thereby to oblige the Imperiali&s;ts to return back to their defence. But the <HI>Malecontents</HI> having no mind to engage with the Duke, <HI>Tekely</HI> was contented to encamp upon the <HI>Mark;</HI> however, in obedience to the Grand Vi&s;iers Order, he cau&s;ed the <HI>Tartars</HI> and <HI>Turks</HI> that were with him to enter into <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> having promi&s;ed to follow and &s;econd them with his Army.</P>
<P>The Duke being adverti&s;ed that the Infidels were burning the Villages towards <HI>Eversdorf,</HI> changed his march, having &s;ent orders to <HI>Lubo|miski,</HI> who was in the Avant-guard to hault, and in&s;tead of marching towards <HI>Tuln,</HI> he went to meet the Turks, leaving his Baggage at <HI>Stoka|reau</HI> with the Regiment of <HI>Rokondi,</HI> leaving to Count <HI>Le&s;ley</HI> the Care of the Execution of tho&s;e things which he had re&s;olved in order to the Pa&s;&s;age of the <HI>Danube,</HI> and the Conjunction of the Auxiliary Forces.

<P>The Duke hereupon immediately command|ed Baron <HI>Mercy,</HI> with &s;ome Troops, to the top of the height to di&s;cover the Enemy. Upon his report he put the Army in Battalia, extend|ing his right Wing towards the Wood, under the command of the Counts <HI>Caprara</HI> and <HI>Rabotta,</HI> po&s;ting the Dragoons there, and &s;ome &s;mall Field-pieces; and the left Wing was extended along the Plain under the Conduct of Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Baden.</HI> He drew the whole into two Lines, and a re&s;erve, on the right whereof <HI>Lu|bomirski</HI>'s <HI>Poles</HI> were placed. The Imperial Ar|my was compo&s;ed of thirteen Regiments of Hor&s;e, and five of Dragoons, be&s;ides <HI>Lubomirs|ki</HI>'s two thou&s;and <HI>Poles.</HI> Whil&s;t the Imperiali&s;ts formed their Squadrons, the Turks likewi&s;e ranged theirs, leaving the gro&s;s of their Troops in the bottom of the Plain. They began a line upon the heights extending to the left, as if de|&s;igning to gain the flank of the Imperiali&s;ts. As &s;oon as they were approached each other, they began to skirmi&s;h, and as the Armies grew near, the Infidels detach'd two great Troops, the one of <HI>Turks,</HI> which moved ea&s;ily, and the other of <HI>Tartars,</HI> who advanced towards the left. Some Volleys of Cannon which the Emperours Dra|goons had on their right, did &s;omewhat di&s;or|der the Turks whil&s;t they advanced, but did not hinder them to charge the <HI>Poles</HI> with much firmne&s;s. They immediately routed two &s;qua|drons, and with a &s;urpri&s;ing Vigour, or rather Temerity, pa&s;&s;ed even to the &s;econd Line, as well by the way they had made, as by the in|terval which the Imperial Hor&s;e had left, re|ceiving in their Pa&s;&s;age the fire of all the Neigh|bour &s;quadrons which flank'd them in this charge. Notwith&s;tanding that, &s;ome of them penetrated even to the Re&s;erves, and endeavour|ed to return by the &s;ame way they came, and after the &s;ame manner, but few of them came off.</P>
<P>On the left Wing, the <HI>Tartars</HI> having endea|voured by &s;mall Troops to gain the flank of the Chri&s;tians, were not more luckey, for tho&s;e that pa&s;t were cut in pieces by others that were &s;ent again&s;t them, or obliged to return to their main body; after which, the Imperiali&s;ts ad|vancing always in good order to attack the whole front of the Turks, the Enemy &s;epara|ted before they could come up to them. One part took the way towards the <HI>Marck,</HI> and the other towards the Bridges of <HI>Vienna.</HI> They were followed &s;ome time without being overtaken. Tho&s;e that took on the <HI>Danube</HI> &s;ide, finding them&s;elves pur&s;ued, that the <HI>Poles</HI> were not far off, and that the whole Army marched that way, betook them&s;elves to the only expedient for their e&s;cape, which was to ca&s;t them&s;elves into the River, and endeavour a Pa&s;&s;age by the remaining Po&s;ts and Pillars of the burnt Bridge, leaving their Arms, their Hor&s;es, and their Equipage on the brink of the River; but mo&s;t of the&s;e were drowned, and the re&s;t all kill'd or taken. The Night being come on, the Duke camped where he was. On the morrow he was pre&s;ented with &s;everal Standards, Timbals, and Drums, and &s;ome Pri&s;oners of note were like|wi&s;e brought to him. The Turks lo&s;t, as was di&s;covered by their own intercepted Letters, from a thou&s;and to twelve thou&s;and Men, ma|ny were killed upon the place, but many were drowned. The Chams Son was hurt, but &s;aved him&s;elf by &s;wimming upon his Hor&s;e. The Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Erlaw</HI> was &s;lain, with many Officers. The next Morning &s;ome Pri&s;oners were taken, found hid in the Hedges and Bu&s;hes. Their Army con&s;i&s;ted of near fourteen thou&s;and <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars,</HI> all Hor&s;e, but that of the Malecon|tents &s;tayed at the <HI>Marck.</HI></P>
<P>The Duke came the &s;ame day to <HI>Cronenberg,</HI> to refre&s;h his Hor&s;e which had been upon Service twenty four hours, with de&s;ign to go and fight the Malecontents if they continued in their Po&s;t. He &s;ent, for this purpo&s;e, to General <HI>Siemariski,</HI> who was come to <HI>Nekelburg</HI> with a body of Hor&s;e, being the King of <HI>Polands</HI> Avaunt-Guard, to meet him the next day upon the way to <HI>Volgers|dorff;</HI> but being upon his March, he had News that the <HI>Tekeli&s;ts</HI> were retired to <HI>Tirnau;</HI> that the King had &s;ent order to his General to attend him at <HI>Nekelburg,</HI> and that his Maje&s;ty would be at <HI>Krembs</HI> the fir&s;t of <HI>September.</HI> The Duke hereupon returned to his Camp at <HI>Cronenburg,</HI> to expect the arrival of the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Army.</P>
<P>They &s;eemed in the Town in much di&s;tre&s;s, for the Governour had cau&s;ed forty Rockets to be fir'd from the top of St. <HI>Stephens</HI> Steeple, to adverti&s;e the Duke of the &s;traits they were in, and the nece&s;&s;ity of being &s;uddenly relieved. The Grand Vi&s;ier &s;eemed to &s;corn the&s;e &s;igns, an&s;wering them with two hundred Cannon &s;hot. And yet it was ob&s;erved, that the Infidels &s;ent many Camels laden with Baggage and &s;e|veral Servants towards <HI>Presburg,</HI> probably to &s;ecure them in ca&s;e they &s;hould be forced to rai&s;e the Siege.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day, the Duke &s;ent the Chevalier <HI>Lubormiski</HI> to compliment the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> who had al&s;o orders to inform his Maje&s;ty of the mea&s;ures they had taken for the relief of <HI>Vi|enna:</HI> and that it &s;eemed to require all their ha&s;te, as the Counts <HI>Capliers</HI> and <HI>Starenberg</HI> &s;ignified by their Letters, the Place being reduced to Extre|mity, but writ in &s;uch Terms which made it evident they would defend it with their Lives, but could an&s;wer for nothing el&s;e.</P>
<P>The Grand Vi&s;ier did in the mean time or|der the <HI>Walachians</HI> to endeavour to rebuild the Bridges of <HI>Vienna,</HI> to the end that they might, by a diver&s;ion that way, retard the march of the Imperiali&s;ts, or employ a con&s;iderable body by that means. As the Waters were grown ex|tream low &s;ince the Bridges were ruined, in&s;o|much that the Pillars which had been then burnt level with the Water, appeared now three or four foot above Water which gave room for this Enterpri&s;e. They were furni&s;hed with Timber out of the Neighbouring Villages, and the Work was carried on by the <HI>Walachians</HI> and <HI>Moldavians</HI> with &s;o much diligence, that near a third of the great Bridge was laid in two Nights.</P>
<P>The Duke having notice hereof, cau&s;ed Boats to be prepared for the retaking of tho&s;e Po&s;ts which he had quitted in the I&s;les. The Count <HI>Archinto</HI> and Collonel <HI>Hey&s;ter</HI> were employed herein, who on the Night of the <HI>31th</HI> of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> re-entered their old Retrenchments, planting there &s;ome Pieces of Cannon. Upon break of day they began to play upon the Turks, who were &s;o greatly incommoded by the continual firing of great and &s;mall &s;hot, that they were ob|liged to quit their Enterpri&s;e. They afterwards applyed Pitch and Tar Barrels to the Pillars that remained, and &s;o burnt them. The &s;ame day the Turks &s;ent away many Camels, Wag|gons loaden with Baggage, and part of their Artillery, which they conducted towards the
<PB N="298" REF="146">Fore&s;t of <HI>Vienna.</HI> After Noon, tho&s;e who were upon the Ramparts heard &s;everal Musket &s;hots the way that the&s;e Infidels marched, which made them gue&s;s that they were skirmi&s;hing with the <HI>Pickeerers</HI> of the Chri&s;tian Army, and that con&s;equently the Succors were near hand.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> being adverti&s;ed that the King of <HI>Poland</HI> lay at <HI>Heil|bron,</HI> left the command of the Army to Count <HI>Caprara,</HI> and went to give this Prince a vi&s;it. He met him at the Head of his <HI>Hu&s;&s;ars,</HI> and alight|ing from his Hor&s;e, when he was come within twenty five paces of him, moved towards him, which his Maje&s;ty perceiving, he likewi&s;e de|&s;cended, met him and embraced him, and after &s;ome obliging di&s;cour&s;e, he pre&s;ented the Prince his Son to him, &s;aying, he would have him to be his Servant, as he was, and that he had brought him with him to teach him betimes to &s;erve the Emperour. The Senators, the Pala|tines, and the principal Officers of the Crown, did likewi&s;e complement the Duke. The King and Duke mounted on Hor&s;eback, and having pa&s;&s;ed the Troops, continued their march, di&s;|cour&s;ing the whole time together. When they arrived in the Camp, they entered the Kings Tent, together with the Prince and the Grandees of <HI>Poland,</HI> where the Duke entertained his Ma|je&s;ty with the main Di&s;cour&s;es that tended to the Affairs in hand.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Waldeck,</HI> who had no Oppor|tunity to &s;peak with the Duke in the Kings Tent, went to attend him at <HI>Stokarcau,</HI> where he communicated all his Thoughts, and agreed with him of the Manner and Method they were to u&s;e in relieving the Place.</P>
<P>The Duke dined that day with the King, &s;it|ting at the upper end on the Right-Hand of the King, the Prince being &s;eated on his left, all three in Chairs with backs. Some Palatines and Officers of the Imperial Army were al&s;o placed at the Table by the Kings Order. After this repa&s;t the Duke returned to his Camp very well &s;atisfied with the Civilities done him by his Maje&s;ty, who likewi&s;e approved of all what this Prince had propo&s;ed to him, and upon his reite|rated In&s;tances he made to him for ha&s;tening the Conjunction of his Forces, he &s;ent Orders to his Great General, who was &s;tayed behind, to ha&s;ten his march. The King him&s;elf re&s;olved to be at <HI>Krembs</HI> the &s;econd of <HI>September,</HI> where the Em|perour was to come to agree about the Conjun|ction and Pa&s;&s;age of the Armies.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Emperour, who &s;hould have come to <HI>Krembs,</HI> not only to animate and authori&s;e the Expedition by his Pre&s;ence, but al&s;o to allay the infinite Difficulties which the Competition of &s;o many Princes would occa&s;i|on, was retained at <HI>Lintz</HI> by an Indi&s;po&s;ition of Health. Thus the Care of all was left to the Duke of <HI>Lorrain;</HI> as al&s;o to regulate the Preten|&s;ions of the Auxiliary Armies. Having at length found Expedients for all the&s;e Difficulties, he went and acquainted the King of <HI>Poland</HI> with what he had de&s;igned, which being highly ap|proved of, he went thence to <HI>Otel&s;dorff,</HI> where at his intreaty the Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> and all the Ge|nerals met him. After &s;ome Conte&s;tations, the Pa&s;&s;age of the <HI>Danube,</HI> and the Conjunction of all the Auxiliaries was re&s;olved upon, which was to be <HI>September</HI> 5. in the Plains of <HI>Tuln.</HI> It was determined that the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Army, with that of the Emperours, &s;hould pa&s;s where they were. That the <HI>Saxons</HI> &s;hould traver&s;e the River upon the Bridge at <HI>Krembs,</HI> and whereas the <HI>Bavari|ans</HI> with &s;ome <HI>German</HI> Troops camped there un|der the Command of Count <HI>Le&s;ley,</HI> they &s;hould all march in body to <HI>Tuln,</HI> to joyn the Imperial Army, and that of <HI>Poland.</HI></P>
<P>The Princes upon Con&s;ultation deferred the Execution of this De&s;ign till the &s;eventh. The King began to pa&s;s the &s;ixth, in the Evening. The Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> after having detached the Contes of <HI>Lodrox, Riccardi</HI> and <HI>Herberwiller,</HI> with their Regiments, and two Batalions of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> to joyn 3000 <HI>Poles,</HI> which the King ought to add to them to form a Body to cover <HI>Moravia;</HI> he &s;ent Collonel <HI>Hey&s;ter</HI> with 600 Hor&s;e to <HI>Clo|&s;terneuburg,</HI> with orders to make Fires upon the heights of <HI>Khalenberg,</HI> to adverti&s;e the be&s;ieged by this &s;ign, which was concerted betwixt them, of the approach of their relief.</P>
<P>The be&s;ieged had been extreamly pre&s;&s;ed, for the Turks had fini&s;hed their Galleries, and at|tacked the two Ba&s;tions of <HI>Lebel</HI> and the <HI>Court,</HI> &s;o that the be&s;ieged did daily by Me&s;&s;ages and Rockets adverti&s;e their Friends of the extremi|ty they were reduced to, the Enemy being now attacked to the very body of the place, having made a great breach in the Court Ba&s;tion. The &s;ixth at Night they were greatly encouraged by the firing of five Fu&s;ees or Rockets upon the Mountain of <HI>Kalenberg,</HI> which made them judge their help near hand, and which they an&s;wered by the like Signal.</P>
<P>The Grand Vi&s;ier, not ignorant of the Chri|&s;tians motion, on the &s;eventh commanded a re|view of his Troops to be made, which upon enquiry were repre&s;ented to him by his Officers to amount to 168000 Men; a Li&s;t whereof was found in his Tent, as al&s;o in that of <HI>Reiz Effendi,</HI> or chief Secretary, the which we have omitted here, not to puzzle the cour&s;e of Hi&s;tory with hard Names: but &s;hall however, to &s;atisfie the more curious, &s;ubjoyn not only that, but an ex|act account of the Chri&s;tian Army that rai&s;ed this celebrious Siege, and al&s;o of tho&s;e Worthies who de&s;erve to have their Memories transferred to Po&s;terity, for defending their City with &s;o &s;ignal Bravery and Con&s;tancy.</P>
<P>It did not &s;eem that the Chri&s;tian Princes in the Turki&s;h Army did &s;erve them with any great good will. <HI>Tekely,</HI> who had been but once in the Camp to &s;alute the Grand Vi&s;ier, left but a thou&s;and <HI>Hungarians</HI> with him upon his de|parture; and <HI>Aba&s;&s;i,</HI> though often invited to the Port, excu&s;ed his attendance by manifold Pre|tences. However the Vi&s;ier being entred <HI>Hun|gary,</HI> he could not di&s;pen&s;e with his waiting up|on him at <HI>Javarin,</HI> though but with few Troops. He was notwith&s;tanding well received by this Mini&s;ter, and &s;ent back to guard the Pa&s;&s;ages betwixt <HI>Raab</HI> and <HI>Ramnitz,</HI> and the Bridges which the Turks had built upon tho&s;e two Ri|vers, to &s;ecure a retreat in ca&s;e Fortune proved their Enemy.

</LETTER>
<P>The Infidels, upon the approach of the Chri|&s;tians, were in no little di&s;order, their whole Camp being in a tumultuous Motion, their Hor&s;e mov'd confu&s;edly, and the Servants were &s;een to load their Camels with Baggage, which made the Be&s;ieged judge, that they de&s;ign'd to march to meet the Succours; notwith&s;tanding this Di&s;order, they did not di&s;continue their Approaches, and the following day redoubled the firing of their Cannon and Mortars. That Morning, a Pri&s;oner being taken, reported, That the Turks were in a great Con&s;ternation, be|cau&s;e the Chri&s;tians were already upon the Mountain of <HI>Kalemberg.</HI> Tho&s;e who were up|on the Rampart &s;aw their Enemies pull down their Tents, and go and joyn their Compani|ons, who were advanced to oppo&s;e the Pa&s;&s;age of the Chri&s;tians, and about Noon they &s;aw a great Body ranging them&s;elves in Battalia at the foot of the Mountain, whil&s;t others joyned them, carrying with them all their Baggage and Provi&s;ions upon Waggons and Camels, as if they de&s;igned to change their Camp, where they al&s;o planted their Pavilions in the &s;ame manner, as if they intended a long &s;tay there, probably to refre&s;h them&s;elves, to be more brisk, and in a condition to fight the Succours when they &s;hould de&s;cend from the Hills. During all the&s;e motions, the attack was carried on with redoubled vigour, and though the defence was yet braver, yet at Night they fired many Rock|ets to adverti&s;e their friends that the place was reduced to the la&s;t extremity, and that they could hold out no longer.</P>
<P>But now the Chri&s;tians were &s;een to cover the Mountain of <HI>Kalemberg,</HI> and to &s;alute their Ene|mies with &s;everal volleys of Cannon. To com|prehend well the joy of the be&s;ieged at &s;o char|ming a &s;pectacle, we need but repre&s;ent to our &s;elves, how they had been clo&s;e &s;hut up the &s;pace of nine Weeks, being every hour, indeed mo|ment, in cruel apprehen&s;ions for their goods, their lives, their Wives and their Children; and to &s;ee them&s;elves now upon the point to be delivered from the&s;e terrible alarms.</P>
<P>The Chri&s;tian Army being a&s;&s;embled, as is already &s;aid, at <HI>Tuln,</HI> and that the Duke of <HI>Lor|rain</HI> had put an end to &s;everal difficulties which were again &s;tarted about the Rank, and the com|mand of &s;o many Princes and Generals, he brought it to a conclu&s;ion, that they &s;hould march the next day, being the <HI>9th,</HI> towards <HI>Vi|enna.</HI> As &s;oon as this re&s;olution was taken, he &s;ent Baron <HI>Mercy</HI> to <HI>Morbach</HI> with 2000 Hor&s;e, to ob&s;erve the countenance and motions of the Turks. The <HI>9th,</HI> at the point of day, he march|ed with all the <HI>German</HI> Army, and came and encamped betwixt St. <HI>Andrew</HI> and <HI>Koning&s;eck.</HI> In this Po&s;t he received advice of the Cities be|ing reduced to its la&s;t extremity, and that they fired with nothing but Muskets. He &s;ent to ad|verti&s;e the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> who was yet at <HI>Tuln,</HI> with the news, and cau&s;ed the Pri&s;oners to be conducted to him, who confirmed the advice. He writ al&s;o to him, be&s;eeching him to advance and joyn with him.</P>
<P>The <HI>10th,</HI> the Duke cau&s;ed the <HI>Germans</HI> to en|ter the Mountains by three &s;everal avenues, and left a fourth for the March of the <HI>Poles.</HI> He camped at <HI>Wilbleng,</HI> and the <HI>Poles</HI> re&s;ted an hour behind to the right. The King him&s;elf came to di&s;cover the heights where the Imperiali&s;ts were camped. The Duke &s;hewed him <HI>Kalem|berg</HI> from thence, whither he would march next morning; and his Maje&s;ty returned to his Camp. By favour of the night the Duke went in Per&s;on to di&s;cover the pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Kalemberg,</HI> and to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e Po&s;ts he judged nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;|&s;ure their march. He al&s;o &s;ei&s;ed the Chappel of St. <HI>Leopold,</HI> and having put 300 men into it to &s;ecure it, returned to his Camp, having &s;ent to inform the King of what was done; after this the Ar|my was put in Battel-array to po&s;&s;e&s;s <HI>Kalemberg</HI> by five differing ways, according to the directi|ons given by the Duke, and con&s;ented to by the King. The way on the right was left to his Maje&s;ty, as the day before.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Sax-Lawenburg,</HI> General of the Hor&s;e, took the next pa&s;&s;age to the <HI>Poles,</HI> con|ducting by that way the Right Wing, con&s;i&s;ting of eight Regiments of the Emperour's Hor&s;e, two of Dragoons, and one of Crauats, of all the Hor&s;e and all the Dragoons of <HI>Bavaria</HI> and <HI>Francony.</HI></P>
<P>The Infantry of <HI>Franconia</HI> and <HI>Bavaria</HI> took the third way, which was the middle-mo&s;t, be|ing commanded by the Prince of <HI>Waldeck.</HI> The Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> placed him&s;elf with the &s;aid Prince that day, and continued there all the day following, advancing with much firm|ne&s;s in places of mo&s;t danger, but without any Fonction or command, he having declared at fir&s;t, that he would only &s;erve as a Voluntier.</P>
<P>All the Emperour's Infantry, and that of <HI>Sax|ony,</HI> took the other two pa&s;&s;ages to the left, whereof one was that of St. <HI>Leopold</HI>'s Chappel, being the high-way, and the other went along the <HI>Danube.</HI> Prince <HI>Herman</HI> of <HI>Baden</HI> and Count <HI>Le&s;ley</HI> General of the Artillery were at the head of the Foot. Count 4<HI>Caprara</HI> General of the Hor&s;e followed immediately by the &s;ame ways with the left Wing, which contained &s;even Regi|ments of the Emperour's, <HI>Lubomirski's Poles,</HI> to which the King had joyned &s;ome Squadrons of his, and all the Cavalry and Dragoons of <HI>Saxony.</HI> The Elector of <HI>Saxony</HI> commanded the Auxilia|ry Troops, which, however of differing tempers and Bodies, marched in Battalia, in as much as the ground would permit it, and were compu|ted to amount to 65000 men. About eleven of the clock, the fir&s;t Squadrons had gained the tops of <HI>Kalemberg,</HI> without any oppo&s;ition at all. They there extended the Front of the Ar|my above a league and a half, camping on the declivity of the Mountain towards <HI>Clo&s;ternew|burg,</HI> in three lines, and &s;ome places more, as the ground would permit them, &s;eizing there|by &s;even or eight Avenues, by which they might de&s;cend and range them&s;elves for the combat.</P>
<P>They brought at the &s;ame time &s;ome &s;mall Field-Pieces to St. <HI>Leopold,</HI> and to the Mona&s;tery of <HI>Camaldoli.</HI> The remainder al&s;o of the day and all the night was &s;pent in advancing the Train, which was not effected without great trouble, the Mountain being &s;o &s;teep, that none but &s;mall Field-Pieces could be brought up, nor they but in &s;ome time doubling and tripling the draught Hor&s;es.</P>
<P>The Turks &s;eeing the Chri&s;tians appear about the Chappel of St. <HI>Leopold,</HI> and the afore&s;aid Mona&s;tery, drew out on their right, advanced to the foot of the Mountains and extending thence to the brink of the <HI>Danube,</HI> they &s;eized the Hedges, hollow-ways and heights, from whence they might incommode the Enemy at the de&s;|cent of the hills and fir&s;t filings out of their &s;treights.</P>
<PB N="300" REF="147">
<P>The Cannon being arrived at St. <HI>Leopold</HI> and <HI>Camaldoli,</HI> they-quickly obliged the Turks to quit the Po&s;ts which they had taken, and re|move out of their &s;hot. The Troops which they had advanced, con&s;i&s;ted in Hor&s;e, and ano|ther &s;ort of Militia, which fights like our Dra|goons on Hor&s;e-back and on foot. Of the&s;e the number was great, and they had brought but few Foot out of the Camp, and without Cannon in all this detachment which they oppo&s;ed a|gain&s;t the Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>The &s;pace betwixt <HI>Vienna</HI> and the entry of the Wood is reckoned a League and a half, the Country being very difficult, trenched with Vineyards, Ravines and hollow ways. The Vineyard was enclo&s;ed by a great Dike which covered the Turks Camp on the &s;ide of <HI>Helg&s;tat.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> had cho&s;en this march, to make u&s;e of the advantage of the heights, and judging that in a &s;ituation of this nature, he might &s;ecure his Flanks. His de&s;ign was the next day to coa&s;t the <HI>Danube,</HI> and to attack the Turk|i&s;h Camp on their right. It was for this rea&s;on, and becau&s;e of the cuts in the ground, that he placed a great Body of Foot to the left, this Wing being de&s;igned fir&s;t to charge the Ene|mies.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Poland,</HI> who &s;tay'd an hour be|hind, having encamped, came to St. <HI>Leopolds</HI> Chappel, from whence the Duke &s;hewed him the de&s;cent of the Mountain, the Camp of the Turks, and the Troops which were advanced to oppo&s;e the de&s;cent of the Chri&s;tians. Their Countenance made his Maje&s;ty of opinion, that they would di&s;pute all the pa&s;&s;ages, and that the Duke &s;hould do well if they could the next day &s;eize the fir&s;t heights at the entry of the Wood. He moreover de&s;ired &s;ome <HI>German</HI> Foot to joyn with his in the de&s;cent of the Mountain. Ha|ving obtained four Battalions, he cau&s;ed them to advance on that &s;ide, whereby the <HI>Poles</HI> were to de&s;cend. Towards the evening of that day, the Duke having &s;urveyed the ground at the foot of <HI>Camaldoli,</HI> ordered Count <HI>Le&s;ley</HI> to com|mand &s;ome Troops to take po&s;t at night at the going out of the Wood, and to rai&s;e a Battery there, the better to &s;ecure the pa&s;&s;age of the Army the next day. At fir&s;t there were but two Battalions &s;ent Count <HI>Le&s;ley,</HI> deferring to &s;end any greater number till it was with the Artillery. They laboured all Night at this work; but the Turks being aware of it, before it was fini&s;hed, they &s;ent &s;ome Troops very early to hinder the Labourers, and po&s;ted them&s;elves neat them behind a Curtain, and behind Planks which well-nigh &s;hut the de&s;cent from the Mountain before the Chri&s;tians Battery. Count <HI>Fontaine,</HI> who commanded the Po&s;t, was quick in oppo&s;ing their effort, and having called the men from their work, and got his two Battali|ons together, he po&s;ted them betwixt his Batte|ry and their Barricado, yet &s;o as not to be en|compa&s;&s;ed by them, who at the &s;ame time be|gan to &s;tretch to the right and left, to gain the Chri&s;tians Flanks.</P>
<P>The Duke, who ob&s;erved from St. <HI>Leopolds</HI> Chappel the Turks motion, &s;ent &s;ome Battalions of the Regiments next hand to the relief of his men. The&s;e being commanded by the Duke of <HI>Croy,</HI> arriving in time, the Imperiali&s;ts exten|ded their line, and took a re&s;olution to attack the Infidels in their Po&s;t behind their blind. This was executed with &s;o much vigour, that the Enemy were forced to give way. They a|bandoned their Po&s;t, and retired to another, where the gro&s;s of their Body remained. The Duke of <HI>Croy</HI> having his &s;houlder pierced with a Musket-&s;hot in this action, was obliged to re|tire, leaving the command to <HI>C. Fontaine,</HI> who di&s;po&s;ed all things for the defence of the Po&s;t, which the Enemy &s;eemed forward to attack a|gain, but they contented them&s;elves with &s;hoot|ing out of their own &s;tation, the fire continuing brisk on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>The Duke perceiving that the Turks made all that Body move which had camped beyond <HI>Neudorff</HI> to &s;upport their advanced Troops, he fir&s;t commanded all the left Wing to march, and pre&s;ently after he gave order to Prince <HI>Wal|deck,</HI> and to the Duke of <HI>Sax-Lawenburg,</HI> to ru&s;h out of the Woods upon the Enemies, who were at the head of their Camp. He &s;ent to adverti&s;e the King of <HI>Poland</HI> of all this, and under&s;tand|ing that his Maje&s;ty came to St. <HI>Leopolds</HI> Chappel, he went to meet him there, and &s;hewing the motions the Armies were in, he acquainted him with all the orders that he had given upon this occa&s;ion. After they had agreed upon all things, the King having performed his devotion at the Chappel, mounting on Hor&s;e-back, he went from Rank to Rank, exhorting his Officers and Soul|diers to do well, and &s;pake to them after this manner.</P>
<P>Generous Poli&s;h Cavaliers, <HI>It is not only to de|fend the glory which your Ance&s;tors, and your courage have acquired to you, of being e&s;teemed the invincible Bulwark of Chri&s;tendom again&s;t the</HI> Ottoman <HI>Power, It is not the defence only of your own Country, which the lo&s;s of</HI> Vienna <HI>by an infallible con&s;equence will ex|po&s;e to the cruel Inva&s;ion of tho&s;e again&s;t whom you are going to fight; but it is the cau&s;e of God, and to &s;ave the Empire of the West which does us the honour to have recour&s;e to our Arms; an honour which our An|ce&s;tors did never pre&s;ume to hope for, and which is re|&s;erved for your valour. Think then of nothing but conquering, or to dye nobly in this occa&s;ion, to which the glory of Martyrdom is concomitant. Think that your King fights in the head of you, to partake with you of your perils and your victories, and rest a&s;&s;ured that the God of Battels, who&s;e cau&s;e we are going to defend, will not fail to fight for us.</HI></P>
<P>Whil&s;t this Prince endeavoured by his di&s;|cou&s;es to in&s;pire his Troops with that generous ardour he was him&s;elf agitated; the Citi|zens of <HI>Vienna,</HI> who had been adverti&s;ed of the approach of their relief, &s;aw with inexpre&s;&s;ible content, the Army of the Chri&s;tians de&s;cend from the Mountains of <HI>Kalemberg,</HI> being a&s;cer|tained by the noi&s;e of the Cannon which was &s;hot again&s;t the Turks, who had parapetted the Pa&s;&s;ages with earth and &s;tone, though to no pur|po&s;e, that their deliverance was near. And they would al&s;o contribute all they could to it, by the di&s;charge of all their Artillery from the Ba&s;ti|ons and Curtains of the wall. There was al&s;o an infinity of &s;mall &s;hot di&s;charged on both &s;ides, with many Granadoes. The Turks had not as yet &s;hot &s;o many Bombs &s;ince the beginning of the Siege, as they did this day, to retard the Chri&s;tians that de&s;cended into the Plain, and to annoy tho&s;e who crowded upon the heights of the City, to ob&s;erve the de&s;cent of their friends and the combat.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the King of <HI>Poland</HI> continued his march at the head of his Army, the Duke of <HI>Lorraine</HI> cau&s;ed <HI>Heisters</HI> Regiment of Dragoons, and a|nother of <HI>Saxony,</HI> which Count <HI>Caprara</HI> po&s;ts to the left at the foot of St. <HI>Leopolds</HI> Chappel, to de&s;cend. That of <HI>Heister</HI> received orders at eight of the clock to go and attack the Enemies, who had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a place to the left, from whence they troubled the Imperiali&s;ts, and the Infantry had likewi&s;e order to advance upon the Turks, who were retired behind their courtains
<PB N="301" REF="147">and hollow ways. This motion was made on both &s;ides at once. The Turks made &s;ome re|&s;i&s;tance at fir&s;t, but not with Vigour enough to hinder the Chri&s;tians advance, who obliged them to retire behind another blind.</P>
<P>Count <HI>Le&s;ley,</HI> who had brought down &s;ome Cannon, planted it at the head of the Infantry. The Duke of <HI>Croy</HI> was al&s;o returned, for having u&s;ed the fir&s;t Applications to his hurt, he had force enough not to quit the fight the whole day. This advantage gave both time and room to ex|tend the front of the left Wing, as it de&s;cended and i&s;&s;ued out of the Streights. In the mean time, the fir&s;t Line of Infantry, which in their march again&s;t the Infidels gave continual fire with their Mu&s;quets, mingled with that of Field|pieces, beat them out of another Po&s;t, and a Line of Curtain which reach'd from the <HI>Danube</HI> Hill over again&s;t the <HI>Carthu&s;ians.</HI> The Duke about ten a Clock made a halt, and whil&s;t the re&s;t of the left Wing filled the ground which the fir&s;t Troops had taken, and that Count <HI>Caprara</HI> ex|tended it to the Banks of the <HI>Danube;</HI> he &s;ent or|ders to the Prince of <HI>Waldeck,</HI> who began to ap|pear upon th fir&s;t heights to the right, and to the Duke of <HI>Saxon-Lawenburg,</HI> who was al&s;o got out of the Wood, to continue their march until they were equal with the front of the Troops com|manded by the Duke of <HI>Croy,</HI> and to advance extending to the right, until they came within &s;hot of the <HI>Poles,</HI> upon their i&s;&s;uing out of their Avenues which were on the right hand of all.</P>
<P>The&s;e orders being given, the Duke returned to the head of the left Wing, to make the great Body of the <HI>Germans</HI> move at once. The Great Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> came and joyned him, and continued always near him in the places the mo&s;t expo&s;ed. At Noon they &s;aw the King at the Head of his Troops, who came and joyned the right Wing of the Imperiali&s;ts. The Duke in the mean time took care that in marching to the Enemy, the Subaltern Generals &s;hould rally and re-e&s;tabli&s;h any Di&s;orders which might have happened by the Difficulty of the Pa&s;&s;ages, and that all &s;hould advance with equality, firing continually with their great and &s;mall &s;hot.</P>
<P>The march was in this order, though &s;lowly, by rea&s;on of the roughne&s;s of the way, and the oppo&s;ition of the Enemy, the left moving along the <HI>Danube</HI> as far as the Village of <HI>Neudorff,</HI> car|ryed it, after a con&s;iderable re&s;i&s;tance. To the right, upon the &s;ame Line, there was another Hill guarded by the Turks, at the attack where|of a Dutch Batallion being di&s;ordered, was &s;uc|coured by <HI>Stirums</HI> Dragoons, ordered by Count <HI>Dunewald.</HI> This Batallion recovered, took the Po&s;t, and continued to advance.</P>
<P>The ju&s;tne&s;s of this march, the Chri&s;tian Ar|mies order of Battel, and the &s;cituation of the Place, which made the Imperiali&s;ts appear as in a kind of Amphitheater, pre&s;ented a great and formidable object to the &s;ight, which a&s;toni&s;hed the Turks, and did not a little contribute to the Victory.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Poland</HI> being yet behind, the Ar|my halted near <HI>Newdorff,</HI> until he was advanced upon the &s;ame Line, after which they continued their march. The Imperiali&s;ts carried, without very great re&s;i&s;tance, the Po&s;t the Turks had at <HI>Helg&s;tat,</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Waldeck</HI> obliged tho&s;e that oppo&s;ed him to retire.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Infidels, who were in Battalia in their Camp, moved as if they had de&s;igned upon the left Wing, but perceiving the Army of <HI>Poland</HI> upon the heights, they mo|ved that way, &s;o that the <HI>Poles</HI> and <HI>Turks</HI> faced each other almo&s;t in the &s;ame order, making more depth then front. The <HI>Poles</HI> &s;eemed back'd by the Wood, and the <HI>Turks</HI> by their Camp.</P>
<P>The King, who was in the head of his Troops, detach'd &s;ome &s;quadrons of his <HI>Hu&s;&s;ars,</HI> who charged the Turks, being all Lanciers, with great Vigour they bore before them tho&s;e that oppo&s;ed them; but engaging them&s;elves too far, they drew &s;o many Enemies upon them, that they were forced to run. The Turks followed them to a Place where Prince <HI>Waldeck</HI> had op|portunely po&s;ted two Batalions of <HI>Bavarians.</HI> The fire of the&s;e Foot cooled the pur&s;uit of the Enemy, and gave the King of <HI>Poland</HI> time to cau&s;e his fir&s;t Line to advance to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the Di&s;order of his <HI>Hu&s;&s;ars.</HI> Count <HI>Rabata,</HI> at the Kings de&s;ire, joyned the Emperours Dragoons with them. But this body of Turks detach'd from their Troops, did not dare to &s;tand the &s;hock of the Chri&s;tians, but retired to a height where they had Foot and Cannon, with more diligence then they were come.</P>
<P>After this advantage, the King continued to march with all his Army, and the Turks en|deavoured to ob&s;truct their Pa&s;&s;age from the &s;e|veral Po&s;ts they had. The fire of their Artillery and Mu&s;quets did &s;ome harm to the <HI>Poles,</HI> but did not break them, and &s;o they advanced &s;till gaining Ground in&s;en&s;ibly upon the Enemy.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Duke being far advan|ced towards the left of the Enemies Camp, to divert their Endeavours upon the right, the Turks put them&s;elves in battalia upon the Ra|vine or &mdash; before their Camp, and planting &s;ome great Guns again&s;t the Chri&s;tians, they made many &s;hot, and &s;eemed by their meen to re&s;olve to defend that Po&s;t which was the &s;tronge&s;t of all, and &s;erved for a Retrenchment for their Camp, but their firmne&s;s did not la&s;t long. The Imperiali&s;ts being advanced within Mu&s;quet &s;hot, they abandoned their Station about five in th Evening, and left them the convenience of pa&s;&s;ing it without di&s;order, and entring into their Camp.</P>
<P>It was then that the Duke, making u&s;e of this Advantage, wheeled all his left Wing, and in|&s;tead of continuing his way by the <HI>Danube,</HI> he cau&s;ed it to march to the right, to enter into the Enemies Camp, no Souldier quitting his rank to pillage their Baggage which they had aban|doned, and their Tents &s;tanding. This motion being perceived by the Turks who were enga|ged again&s;t the <HI>Poles</HI> on the right Wing, quite di&s;mayed them, and they began to retire for fear of being charged in the Flank. The King there|upon pa&s;&s;ed the Ravine with his Troops, not|with&s;tanding the firing of &s;ome Janizaries that defended it, and pur&s;ued the Enemies. About &s;e|ven a Clock he entred their Camp &s;ome little time after Prince <HI>Waldeck,</HI> who pa&s;&s;ed into it with his <HI>Bavarians</HI> and <HI>Franconians.</HI> Half an hour after, the Duke having gained the Suburbs and Counter&s;charp, commanded Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Ba|den</HI> to advance towards the Trenches of the Turks with &s;ome Troops that the Baron of <HI>Mercy</HI> conducted, but this Prince could not come there &s;o &s;oon, but that the Janizaries that were in guard there had lei&s;ure to make their retreat by favour of the Night that came on. They had begun it as &s;oon as they &s;aw the Chri|&s;tians approach their Camp. They retired with no great lo&s;s, having had the bravery before they abandoned their Trenches to attempt ano|ther attack again&s;t the City, and to turn and fire the Cannon of their Batteries again&s;t the Army. The Night &s;u&s;pended the Victory, and obliged the Troops to make halt in that part of
<PB N="302" REF="148">the Camp which was betwixt the <HI>Danube</HI> and the City, the Turks being retreated on the other &s;ide of the River.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Lorraine</HI> &s;ent to complement the King, upon the happy &s;ucce&s;s of that day, which was owing to his pre&s;ence. This Prince returned his complement, confe&s;&s;ing that every body had a &s;hare in it, but that all the honour was due to his Conduct, and to the valour of the <HI>German</HI> Troops, who fir&s;t entred the Camp, and the Enemies works.</P>
<P>During the Night the Turks pa&s;&s;ed the Ri|ver at <HI>Schunket,</HI> making their retreat by the Rear of their Front, and quitted their Camp with &s;o much precipitation, that they left be|hind them in the great Vi&s;ier's Quarters the Standard of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, and the Hor&s;e Tayle, the ordinary En&s;igns of their dignity. They left al&s;o all their Tents, and the greate&s;t part of their Equipage, all their Ammunition and Provi&s;ions, which they had in great abun|dance, all their Artillery, amounting to 180 pieces of Cannon and Mortars, and they ha&s;ten|ed their retreat with &s;o much diligence, that their formo&s;t Troops had the next day pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">b.</HI></P>
<P>The Chri&s;tians lo&s;t no body of con&s;ideration except Prince <HI>Thomas</HI> of <HI>Croy,</HI> the Count of <HI>Tran&s;mandorff,</HI> young <HI>Poloski</HI> Captain of a Com|pany of <HI>Hu&s;&s;ars;</HI> and the wounded, be&s;ides the Duke of <HI>Croy,</HI> the Counts <HI>Fontaine, Tilly,</HI> and <HI>Schalemburg,</HI> were incon&s;iderable.</P>
<P>The <HI>13th</HI> early, the Duke having appointed his Army to be ready, went to wait on the King of <HI>Poland</HI> to regulate their march, and the im|mediate pur&s;uit of the Victory. But finding him little di&s;po&s;ed to it, he omitted no in&s;tan|ces to per&s;wade him to it, propo&s;ing to him to march with all the Army, or with all the Hor&s;e only, or el&s;e with a great detachment; but the King oppo&s;ed the wearine&s;s of his Troops, and the nece&s;&s;ity of refre&s;hing them &s;ome hours. The King thereunto being unwilling, the Duke en|tred into the City.</P>
<P>The Grand Vi&s;ier, before his flight, cau&s;ed the Heads of five of the Women of his Serag|lio to be cut off, for fear they &s;hould fall into the hands of the Conquerors. The Baron of <HI>Kaunitz,</HI> the Emperors Re&s;ident at the Port, who was at pre&s;ent in the Vi&s;ier's Quarters, was in danger of being killed by the Chri&s;tians in the heat of the Battel, as being habited after the Turki&s;h fa&s;hion. By day there was not a Turk left, though they were traced during the ob&s;cu|rity of the Night by the Villages on fire, the Infidels having marked their retreat with this la&s;t cruelty, after they had fir&s;t burnt their Camp, as far as the precipitation of their flight, and the fear which obliged them to be gone would permit them. They retired al&s;o out of the I&s;le by favour of their lower Bridge, the upper Bridge which they had layed being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Chri&s;tians upon their arrival. The &s;ame evening many Cavaliers and Souldiers entered the City with great Droves of Cattel, which they found in the Camp and near it, which con|tinuing the following days, Beef became &s;o cheap that they were &s;old for five and &s;ix Florins each.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> being now a&s;&s;ured that he had no more Enemies to combat, di&s;patcht the Count of <HI>Aversberg,</HI> Son to the Prince of that name, to the Emperor, to inform him with the happy &s;ucce&s;s of that day.</P>
<P>On the morrow of the fight, being the <HI>13th,</HI> the fire took in the Powder which the Turks had left a League from the City, and confumed an infinite number of Bombs, Granadoes, and other artificial fire-works. This accident was attributed to the negligence of &s;ome Chri&s;tian Souldiers, and yet there were prodigious quan|tities of Powder, Bullets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> left behind. It was ob&s;ervable that many of the Cannon which the Turks had abandoned were marked with the Arms of the Emperours <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the fir&s;t, and <HI>Rodolf</HI> the &s;econd.</P>
<P>After the Souldiery had pillaged the immen&s;e Riches of the Camp, which amounted to many Millions, the King of <HI>Poland</HI> entered into the City, accompanied with Count <HI>Starenberg</HI> the Governour, many Commanders, and a great number of the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Nobility, where <HI>Te Deum</HI> being &s;ung, he, the Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> and &s;everal Grandees, were &s;umptuou&s;ly treated by the Go|vernour, the People by their joyful acclamati|ons eechoing the prai&s;es of their Deliverers.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Duke of <HI>Lorraine</HI> was employed in giving the nece&s;&s;ary Orders for the Army, part of it beginning to di&s;camp, and all together with the <HI>Poles,</HI> de&s;igning to go in pur|&s;uit of the Enemy, which favourable conjun|cture was omitted in expectation of the Empe|rour, who al&s;o arrived that evening at <HI>Vienna,</HI> where he was received coming out of his Boat, by the two Electors, and the principal Officers of War and Ju&s;tice. Having taken a view of the Enemies works, He cau&s;ed <HI>Te Deum</HI> to be &s;ung with all the &s;olemnity po&s;&s;ible in the Church of St. <HI>Stephen.</HI> That done, he cau&s;ed the Cre&s;cent and Star, the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Arms, to be taken down from the Spire of that Steeple, pla|ced there &s;ince the time of <HI>Solyman,</HI> being the&s;e la&s;t Turks did not cea&s;e &s;hooting at it, and rai|&s;ed the Cro&s;s in their place.</P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> being the <HI>15th,</HI> the King of <HI>Poland</HI> &s;ent his Grand Chancellor to the Emperor with a numerous Train to complement him, and of|fer him a part of the booty which he had found in the Grand Vi&s;ier's Tent, and among&s;t other things, the Standard which was always carried before him when he marched. It was made of Hor&s;e-hair work'd with the Needle, and em|broidered with flowers, the &s;taff of it was guilt, as al&s;o the Apple which was of bra&s;s. They call it <HI>Tugh</HI> in their Language, which is to &s;ay <HI>Hor&s;e Tayle.</HI> The Chancellor made a very ele|gant Latin Speech, and the Emperour an&s;wer|ed it with Sentiments of e&s;teem and acknow|ledgment for his Maje&s;ty of <HI>Poland.</HI> After a quarter of an hours conver&s;ation with this En|voy, and hearing Ma&s;s in our Lady of <HI>Loretto</HI>'s Chappel, he took Hor&s;e to ride to the Camp, where he was to vi&s;it the King of <HI>Poland.</HI> There was &s;ome difficulty about the upper hand. This Prince pretended it, and there were examples contrary to this preten&s;ion. In the mean time what he had done de&s;erved particular con&s;ide|ration. To conclude, it was re&s;olved, for the removing of the&s;e ob&s;tacles, that the Emperor &s;hould go &s;ee the Troops, that they &s;hould be ranged in Battalia, and that the&s;e two Sove|reigns &s;hould advance within twenty &s;teps of each other, which was performed in the man|ner following. The Emperour, having &s;een the <HI>Bavarians</HI> in Battalia, continued his way to <HI>E|bersdorff,</HI> where the fir&s;t Squadrons of the left Wing were drawn up, and thence he went to <HI>Swech</HI> where the right Wing was po&s;ted, and where the King of <HI>Poland</HI> expected him. Being within Pi&s;tol-&s;hot of each other, the King, with the Prince his Son, upon a little gallop moved forwards, and then both Princes uncovered at once, &s;aluted and covered again in a moment. The Emperor &s;poke fir&s;t, and told the King,
<PB N="303" REF="148"><HI>That he was extremely obliged to him, for leaving his Country, and undertaking a long and painful voyage, to come and combat his Enemies and deliver</HI> Vienna; <HI>that all Chri&s;tendom &s;har'd in the obligation, and that he had covered him&s;elf with glory by &s;o generous an action.</HI> The King of <HI>Poland</HI> an&s;wered him, <HI>that it was to God alone that we ought to render our thanks for this Victory; that he had done nothing but what every Christian Prince was obliged to do upon the like occa&s;ion; and that he would endeavour for the future to do yet more for the Interest of Religion, that all his di&s;plea&s;ure was, that he was not in a condition to pur&s;ue the Enemy upon their defeat, but that his Troops after a march of three days required &s;ome re&s;t, e&s;pecially his Cavalry, the Hor&s;e being extremely tired.</HI> Prince <HI>Alexander,</HI> who by order of his Father was clo|thed that day after the <HI>German</HI> fa&s;hion, ki&s;&s;ed the Emperour's hand, who thereupon returned into the City, and the King further into his Camp. His Imperial Maje&s;ty in his return ob&s;er|ved that all the Villages and Palaces were burnt around, except the place where <HI>Solyman</HI> had formerly camped, when he be&s;ieg'd <HI>Vienna;</HI> in memory whereof the Emperour <HI>Rodolf</HI> had cau&s;ed a hou&s;e of plea&s;ure to be built in that place, with Towers, which were covered with guilt Copper in the &s;ame &s;ymmetry or figure that the Sultans Tents were; &s;o that the Turks being informed that this building had been made after the Model of <HI>Solymans</HI> Camp, would not ruine it during the Siege, but had made a Ma|gazin of it, where was al&s;o found a great quan|tity of Bread and Bi&s;quet.</P>
<P>The Emperour employed the re&s;t of the time that he &s;tayed at <HI>Vienna,</HI> in vi&s;iting the Retrench|ments and Fortifications with Count <HI>Starenberg</HI> had made behind the Ba&s;tions and the Walls, to defend the Ground foot by foot. The Prince Elector of <HI>Saxony</HI> parted the fifteenth with all his Troops. His retreat &s;eemed precipitated, and &s;uppo&s;ed to be upon account of the Pro|te&s;tants of <HI>Hungary,</HI> thinking perhaps he had done enough in &s;aving of <HI>Vienna,</HI> whereto he no|bly contributed. The Emperour, willing to re|compence Count <HI>Starenberg</HI>'s Services, made him Mar&s;hal General of the Field, and of his Privy Council; he gave him 100000 Florins, and writ to the King of <HI>Spain</HI> to &s;end him the Order of the <HI>Golden Fleece.</HI> He al&s;o conferred the &s;ame Employments, and Honours upon Count <HI>Capliers,</HI> and having pre&s;ented Prince <HI>Alexander,</HI> the King of <HI>Polands</HI> Son, with a Sword richly adorned with Jewels of great value, He returned back to <HI>Lintz.</HI> The greate&s;t part of tho&s;e who fled upon the approach of the Turks, returned to the City when they knew the Siege was rai&s;ed. They began to rebuild the Hou&s;es that were ruined, and among&s;t others the Emperours Pa|lace and <HI>Scots</HI> Church,</P>
<P>During the&s;e Triumphs at <HI>Vienna,</HI> the Grand Vi&s;ier, &s;en&s;ible of his misfortune, and the malice of his Enemies, and knowing that the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Buda</HI> would render him no good Offices at Court, upon the rai&s;ing of the Siege of <HI>Vienna,</HI> re&s;olved to prevent him, and informed the Grand Seignior, by an expre&s;s he di&s;patch'd to him to <HI>Belgrade,</HI> that he had di&s;po&s;ed all things to check the fir&s;t on&s;et of the Chri&s;tians, and en|gage them in Battel, which would undoubted|ly have been accompanied with Succe&s;s; but that he was forced to change de&s;ign, becau&s;e the Ba&s;&s;a retired with his Army, the <HI>Walachians,</HI> the <HI>Moldavians,</HI> and the <HI>Hungarians,</HI> which did &s;o mainly abate the Courage of his Troops, that it was afterward impo&s;&s;ible for him to bring them to fight; that &s;o he had been obliged to re|tire to con&s;erve the re&s;t of the Army, and not to hazard the Per&s;on of his Highne&s;s. Neverthe|le&s;s the Grand Vi&s;ier, having well examined the Con&s;equences which the ill Succe&s;s of his Enter|pri&s;e might have, did &s;carce believe him&s;elf &s;e|cure by this precaution, and he per&s;waded him|&s;elf that he mu&s;t immolate the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Buda</HI>'s Life to pre&s;erve his own. He cau&s;ed him im|mediately to be arre&s;ted, together with the Ba&s;|&s;aes of <HI>Er&s;eck</HI> and <HI>Po&s;lega,</HI> who he knew were of Intelligence with the former, and cau&s;ed them all three to be &s;trangled. The&s;e proceedings furni&s;hed his Enemies with Pretexts to de&s;troy him, chiefly the <HI>Ki&s;ler-Aga&s;i,</HI> a Creature of the Sultana <HI>Valide,</HI> to whom &s;he had recommended upon her Death-bed, to revenge her upon this chief Mini&s;ter, which he al&s;o did.</P>
<P>After the Death of the&s;e three Ba&s;&s;aes, the Grand Vi&s;ier continued his march, but in his Pa&s;&s;age by <HI>Raab,</HI> that Garri&s;on fell upon his Rear-Guard, and kill'd near 600 of them. At <HI>Gran</HI> he was joyned by a body of 15000 Turks, who were going to <HI>Belgrade.</HI> The remains of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Army were di&s;per&s;ed &s;ome at <HI>Gran,</HI> &s;ome at <HI>Newhau&s;el,</HI> at <HI>Buda</HI> &s;ome, and the re&s;t en|trenched near <HI>Altemburg.</HI></P>
<P>On the other &s;ide, the Chri&s;tians di&s;cour&s;ed of the re&s;t of the Campania; but as part of the Al|lies did think they had done enough in contri|buting to the relief of <HI>Vienna,</HI> thought of return|ing home, many Councils were held to examine by what means they might be &s;tayed. The Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> continued inflexible in his Re&s;o|lution, adn was marched for his Country. The Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> con&s;ented to leave his Troops with the Emperours, but the Prince of <HI>Waldeck</HI> gave them to under&s;tand, that he &s;hould want new orders for the undertaking of new Enter|pri&s;es with the Troops of <HI>Franconia,</HI> which he commanded. But the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> per&s;wa|ded him&s;elf that the&s;e Difficulties had not hap|ned if by a quick engagement they had hurried the Allies to pur&s;ue the Victory, and this was one of the chief rea&s;ons that moved the Duke to pre&s;s the King in it.</P>
<P>Several Projects were made to divide the Ar|my for different Occa&s;ions, many Conferences were had with the Allyes, and all the time was con&s;umed in Councils. In the mean time, the Duke, who thought of nothing but improving the re&s;t of the Summer, propo&s;ed every thing that he thought favourable, either for the Re|duction of <HI>Hungary,</HI> for the Siege of <HI>Newhau&s;el,</HI> or that of <HI>Gran,</HI> or to take the Po&s;ts of <HI>Barcam,</HI> and that of <HI>Pe&s;t</HI> for the &s;etling of their Winter Quarters, and made it appear that nothing of all this could be done without great Forces, the Army of the Turks not being wholly de&s;eated, however routed, and that the Rebels Army was &s;till entire.</P>
<P>He determined nothing, becau&s;e he knew not what mea&s;ures the Turk would take. He only affirmed, that they ought to march forthwith in|to <HI>Hungary</HI> with all the Di&s;po&s;itions nece&s;&s;ary to act as the Enemies &s;hould direct.</P>
<P>The Emperour having approved his Propo|&s;itions, and the King of <HI>Poland</HI> conforming to them, they marched the <HI>18th</HI> towards <HI>Presburg,</HI> and they encamped the &s;ame day with all the Imperial Troops near <HI>Fichen;</HI> from thence they went to <HI>Heinburg,</HI> and the <HI>20th</HI> they approached <HI>Presburg,</HI> where the Duke expected the Boats from the Bridge of <HI>Tuln</HI> according to orders. However the Bridge could not be fini&s;hed till the <HI>25th,</HI> by rea&s;on of the great Winds, and the Difficulty of getting Boats in a de&s;olate Country. The <HI>Franconians</HI> continued camped near <HI>Vienna,</HI> and the <HI>Bavarians</HI> came the <HI>19th</HI> to <HI>Fichen.</HI></P>
<PB N="304" REF="149">
<P>The <HI>22th,</HI> news came that Count <HI>Budiani,</HI> who upon the arrival of the Turks had abandoned the pa&s;&s;ages which he kept upon the <HI>Raab,</HI> and embraced the party of the Malecontents, after having warred again&s;t the Emperour's Troops with a Body of <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Hungarians</HI> of his Ge|nerality, burnt and pillaged a great number of Villages upon the frontier of <HI>Styria,</HI> had &s;ur|pri&s;ed and cut in pieces tho&s;e &s;ame Turks to which he was united, and had afterwards joyn|ed with the Count of <HI>A&s;premont,</HI> to endeavour to incommode them of the great Army in their retreat towards <HI>Buda.</HI></P>
<P>The Bridge upon the <HI>Danube,</HI> to pa&s;s into the I&s;le of <HI>Schuts,</HI> being fini&s;hed the <HI>25th,</HI> the <HI>Poles</HI> began to file over the &s;ame day, and being fol|lowed by the Emperour's Army, they encam|ped the <HI>27th</HI> at <HI>Gersdorff.</HI> The Marquis of <HI>Barch,</HI> who in the Prince of <HI>Waldeck</HI>'s ab&s;ence, now &s;ick at <HI>Vienna,</HI> commanded the Troops of <HI>Franconia,</HI> adverti&s;ed the Duke that he could not follow him with the Troops of his <HI>Circle,</HI> and &s;ent him the copy of an Order from Prince <HI>Waldeck,</HI> da|ted the <HI>26th.</HI> He received at the &s;ame time a|nother Letter from the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> dated the day following, from his Camp at <HI>Ort,</HI> two Leagues from <HI>Vienna,</HI> which gave him notice that the <HI>Franconians</HI> would not leave their Camp before they had received Orders from the Prin|ces of their <HI>Circle,</HI> which he judged would be rather to recall, than cau&s;e them to advance. He added, that his Infantry being extremely weaken'd and dimini&s;hed by bloudy Fluxes, and his Cavalry ruined, his Troops could not &s;o &s;oon follow the Army of the Emperour; And yet if they would undertake any great action, where they &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary, he would cau&s;e &s;uch as were in condition to &s;erve immediately to march.</P>
<P>The Duke apprehending that this &s;eparation might put him out of condition of undertaking any thing con&s;iderable, &s;ent Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Baden</HI> to the Elector, who was gone to <HI>Bin,</HI> to change Ayr, by rea&s;on of &s;ome indi&s;po&s;ition of health; he was charged to per&s;wade him to let his Troops follow, remon&s;trating to him that it would be a great matter, now that the Forces of the Chri&s;tians were dimini&s;hed, to hinder the Turks to take heart to oblige part of <HI>Hun|gary</HI> to &s;ubmit them&s;elves, to take Po&s;t for Win|ter Quarters in the Enemies Country, and there|by encourage the <HI>Franconians</HI> to follow their example.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Sea&s;on advanced; the&s;e Negotiations con&s;uming much time, and the Duke could make no &s;tay upon command of the Troops he was not &s;ure of, and willing not to lo&s;e the &s;ea&s;on, he per&s;waded the King of <HI>Poland</HI> to continue the march of the Army to|wards <HI>Komorra,</HI> without the Allies. The King advancing always an hour before the Imperia|li&s;ts, they arrived near that City the &s;econd of <HI>October;</HI> they camped at <HI>Wi&s;mar,</HI> and a Council of the Generals of the Army was held there, to know what the Imperiali&s;ts might undertake, independent without the Allies, in ca&s;e of delay or being abandoned.</P>
<P>Intelligence was brought, that <HI>Tekely</HI> with his Army encamped at <HI>Lewentz;</HI> that the gro&s;s of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Army lay about <HI>Buda;</HI> that the Grand Vi&s;ier had &s;ent a Detachment towards <HI>Gran,</HI> that he had put 4000 men into <HI>Newhau&s;el</HI> to fortifie that Garri&s;on, but that there were in the Enemies Army a great many di&s;contented Per&s;ons at the conduct of the Grand Vi&s;ier, by &s;o much the more di&s;&s;atisfied, becau&s;e that up|on his return near <HI>Raab,</HI> he had cau&s;ed the Vi|&s;ier of <HI>Buda</HI> to be &s;trangled, as al&s;o &s;ome other Ba&s;&s;a's, and more than fifty Subaltern Officers, whom he accu&s;ed of not having done their duty in the late Battel; be&s;ides that, he had al&s;o &s;a|crificed a great number of tho&s;e Run-aways, who had preceded his retreat.</P>
<P>After the Council held at <HI>Wi&s;war,</HI> they were not of opinion to attempt the Siege of <HI>Newhau&s;el</HI> in a &s;ea&s;on &s;o advanced, and in a Country full of Mar&s;hes, the Garri&s;on being &s;trong, and a great Army in the Neighbourhood; neither was it thought rea&s;onable to propound the King's going again&s;t the Enemy, becau&s;e the Troops of the Empire had not followed, and that they &s;hould be oblig'd to pa&s;s through a Country where Forrage would be wanting.</P>
<P>The attack of <HI>Gran</HI> &s;eemed but little fea&s;ible before they were Ma&s;ters of <HI>Barcam,</HI> that the communication might be cut off. This inclined the Duke to attempt the Fort of <HI>Barcam,</HI> which is the head of the Bridge of <HI>Gran,</HI> after which they would further deliberate to pa&s;s to <HI>Pe&s;t,</HI> or be&s;iege <HI>Gran,</HI> according to the countenance of the Enemy. The Duke acquainted the King of <HI>Poland</HI> with what had been re&s;olved, where|uto his Maje&s;ty a&s;&s;ented.</P>
<P>On the <HI>3d</HI> of <HI>October,</HI> the King began to pa&s;s that branch of the <HI>Danube</HI> at <HI>Komorra,</HI> called the <HI>Waagh.</HI> The Emperours Hor&s;e followed, and all the Cavalry marched to <HI>Mo&s;e,</HI> where the Count of <HI>Starenberg</HI> was to be on the <HI>7th</HI> with the Infantry, the King having promi&s;ed to &s;tay for him there. The <HI>7th</HI> day, which &s;hould have been a day of repo&s;e, to give the Infantry time to joyn the re&s;t of the Army, the King &s;ent to tell the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> that he would march towards <HI>Barcham,</HI> de&s;iring him that he would do the &s;ame. The Duke, &s;urpri&s;ed with the change, having thereupon &s;ounded to Hor&s;e, &s;ent Count <HI>Dunewald</HI> to his Maje&s;ty, to repre&s;ent to him the nece&s;&s;ity of expecting the Foot, and the danger there was in &s;eparating in the neigh|bourhood of the Armies of the Turks and Re|bels, and in the middle of their Garri&s;ons. The Count found the King already on Hor&s;eback, who an&s;wered him, that having advice that the detachment of the Turks towards <HI>Barcam</HI> was not great, he &s;aw no inconvenience to continue his march. They &s;eeing the King's re&s;olution followed him, leaving but one Company of <HI>Crawats</HI> to accompany the Infantry, which that day were to be at <HI>Mo&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>The King being come within a League of <HI>Barcam,</HI> was adverti&s;ed by his advanced Parties, that &s;ome Squadrons of the Enemy did appear. He ordered a detachment to charge them. They did not &s;tand, but being relieved by a greater Body, the <HI>Poles</HI> who attacqued them were re|pelled.</P>
<P>The King commanded other Squadrons to &s;econd them, which being engaged, he advan|ced him&s;elf with all his Hor&s;e. The gro&s;s of the <HI>Turks</HI> Cavalry, which had continued hither|to covered by a great hill, unexpectedly appea|red &s;ix or 7000 &s;trong, and briskly charging the <HI>Poles</HI> in Flank and Front, put them to flight. The <HI>Turks</HI> charged them hotly in the di&s;order they were, and killed above 2000 of them, and among&s;t the re&s;t, the Palatine of <HI>Pomerania.</HI> They took Tymbals and Standards, and &s;ome Baggage, which by being intermingled with the march of the Troops, did &s;omewhat con|tribute to their defeat.</P>
<P>The Count of <HI>Dunewald,</HI> who had marched all day with the King, &s;eeing the encounters of the fir&s;t Squadrons, &s;ent to tell the Duke, that the <HI>Poles</HI> and the Enemy were engaged, where|upon
<PB N="305" REF="149">he marched &s;wiftly, and filing through a narrow pa&s;&s;age betwixt him and the Plain, he &s;aw upon his arrival that the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Hor&s;e was quite broke, and that the <HI>Turks</HI> were clo&s;e in their pur&s;uit. At this &s;ight, his fir&s;t care was to put the Emperours mo&s;t advanced Troops into Battalia, leaving room for the flying <HI>Poles,</HI> to avoid their running upon him. As &s;oon as he had &s;ome Squadrons of his fir&s;t Line formed, &s;eeing the <HI>Poles</HI> &s;till in di&s;order, he advanced upon the Enemy with his fir&s;t Squadrons, leav|ing Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Baden</HI> to embattel the re&s;t. This motion &s;topt the Enemies carreer, after which they retired with &s;ome &s;peed under <HI>Bar|cam,</HI> to avoid the Imperiali&s;ts charge; whil&s;t the Duke advanced, the Queen of <HI>Polands</HI> Brother came to him, and told him, that he believed the King was lo&s;t, becau&s;e his Maje&s;ty was in the head of all in the places the mo&s;t expo&s;ed, to animate his Men by words, and in&s;pire courage into them by his example. The Duke &s;eeing the Enemy retired, advanced towards the <HI>Poles.</HI> He found the King, who having advanced with the fir&s;t, would be the la&s;t in retiring. He told the Duke how affairs had gone, and it being near Night, they thought of nothing but en|camping.</P>
<P>Fear and Terror had &s;ei&s;ed upon the <HI>Poles,</HI> as is u&s;ual in &s;uch Encounters, they could &s;carce be per&s;waded to keep the Right, becau&s;e of the Neighbourhood of <HI>Barcam,</HI> whither the Enemy was retired; in&s;omuch that the King, for the greater &s;ecurity of his Troops, made them take the Left, de&s;iring the Duke to march into the right with the Emperours Troops, which the&s;e la&s;t had always pretended to; before they di&s;|camped, the Duke &s;ent Orders to Count <HI>Staren|berg</HI> to make ha&s;te and come and joyn him with the foot. The next Morning he was ad|verti&s;ed that the <HI>Poles</HI> continued di&s;quieted; that the lo&s;s they had &s;uffered was extreamly &s;en&s;ible to them, that they would per&s;wade the King not to advance any further, but to retire to the Places de&s;igned for their Quarters; that the principal Officers were much divided, and fi|nally that many Difficulties were alledged to the King to hinder the Execution of the Re&s;olutions which had been taken.</P>
<P>The Duke, who knew the Con&s;equence of re|taining the <HI>Poli&s;h Army,</HI> and in ca&s;e it &s;eparated, they &s;hould lo&s;e the Fruit and Honour of the Campania, the which he de&s;ired to &s;ee fini&s;hed with &s;ome hand&s;ome Action, and not upon a lo&s;s, went to the Kings Quarters, and having found things as they had been repre&s;ented, he endeavoured to per&s;wade his Maje&s;ty to conti|nue in the Terms they had agreed upon. He demon&s;trated to him and his Generals, the un|lucky con&s;equences that were to be feared if they changed de&s;ign, how ea&s;ie it was to force this detachment if they did not delay to attack them, the importance of doing it &s;uddenly, for fear all the Forces of the Enemy might rejoyn them, and he in&s;i&s;ted that they &s;hould advance and charge them as &s;oon as the Foot were come up. The King explained this Di&s;cour&s;e to the Senators and Officers of the Army that did not under&s;tand the Language, and in order to it agreed to march the next Morning, irre&s;olute only upon the ordering of the Battel.</P>
<P>The Duke, who had been vi&s;iting the Ground, made a De&s;cription to the King of it, and the Condition of <HI>Barcam,</HI> and afterwards di&s;cour&s;ed of &s;everal forms of embattelling He propo&s;ed that which they had held at <HI>Vienna,</HI> offering the right to his Maje&s;ty, or to march as they were camped, and divided the <HI>Poles</HI> into the two Wings, which la&s;t propo&s;al was accepted of, and the Re&s;olution to march was taken.</P>
<P>The Army being put into Battalia with the Day, Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Baden</HI> commanded the right Wing, and under him Count <HI>Gondola</HI> and Baron <HI>Mercy,</HI> Count <HI>Dunewald</HI> was in the left, and with him the Counts <HI>Pal&s;i</HI> and <HI>Taff.</HI> Count <HI>Starenberg,</HI> Mar&s;hal of the Field, conducted the Infantry, with the Prince of <HI>Croy</HI> and Count <HI>Se|rin.</HI> This done, the Duke went to the King for the dividing of his Army. His Maje&s;ty having been informed that the Enemies detachment had been augmented by &s;everal Troops con|ducted by <HI>Haly</HI> Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Aleppo,</HI> and by the Ba&s;&s;aes of <HI>Syli&s;tria</HI> and <HI>Caire;</HI> and apprehending that the&s;e Troops were followed by the re&s;t, delibe|rated a-new upon the Enterpri&s;e; but the Duke repre&s;ented to him many motives which made him believe the Army could not yet be come thither. He added, that if it were, he believed the Ground whereon they &s;tood was &s;o advanta|geous, that they ought not to change their De|&s;ign, being the Imperial Army po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the Plain, the <HI>Danube</HI> on the right, and the Moun|tains on the left, and that the Ground growing narrower towards the Enemies, they could not make u&s;e of a great body, though they had it; the&s;e rea&s;ons being approved, the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Army was divided. The King with a party of his <HI>Hu&s;&s;ars,</HI> of his Foot, and of his be&s;t Hor&s;e, placed him&s;elf in the right, betwixt the Emperours Hor&s;e and his Dragoons. The Great General <HI>Jabloriski</HI> did the &s;ame in the left, and the re&s;t of the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Army made a third Line; they march|ed for half an hour in this Order. About nine a Clock they &s;aw the Turks drawn up in the Plain before them. They moved ju&s;tly, and by their firmne&s;s their Forces were judged equal with tho&s;e of the Chri&s;tians. Being come near the Troops that appeared, made a motion, put|ting them&s;elves into three Lines, leaving only two great &s;quadrons on their right. They then came and charged the left of the Chri&s;tian Ar|my with much fiercene&s;s, and &s;earching the <HI>Poles,</HI> they attack'd the <HI>Hu&s;&s;ars,</HI> which the Great General Commanded.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time the gro&s;s of the Turks, who were in the middle of the height, advanced to|wards the adver&s;e Foot, as if they would have charged them, and being come within half Mu&s;quet-&s;hot, they declined to the left of the Chri&s;tians, expo&s;ing their Flank to relieve their own men. The Duke, who was gon towards his Infantry, &s;eeing this motion, ran along the Line of the Hor&s;e of the left Wing, and with all the party of the fir&s;t Line, which had not yet charged, he him&s;elf advanced at the head of the Squadrons, and charged the Enemy in flank, which put them to a general rout, incapacita|ting them to make head again. He ordered <HI>Dunewald</HI> to pur&s;ue with the whole fir&s;t Line, and with all the <HI>Poles</HI> of the &s;ame Wing, who fol|lowed them Pell-Mell to the very Gates of <HI>Bar|kam,</HI> and the Mar&s;hes of <HI>Gran,</HI> where many of them were &s;lain.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t Count <HI>Dunewald</HI> cha&s;ed the Enemy, the Duke cau&s;ed the Army to advance in Bat|talia towards <HI>Barcam.</HI> The King having &s;een the flight of the Turks, was come from the right Wing to the left, to complement the Duke; the Generals and Senators who accompanied him, did the &s;ame. Among&s;t the re&s;t <HI>Jablorisky,</HI> the Grand General of <HI>Poland,</HI> in pre&s;ence of all, avowed, that his People refu&s;ing to advance to &s;u&s;tain the <HI>Hu&s;&s;ars,</HI> the readine&s;s of Count <HI>Dune|wald</HI> to &s;uccour him, and the Vigour of the Em|perours Hor&s;e had repaired that fault, and could
<PB N="306" REF="150">not be &s;ufficiently commended. And now in the di&s;order the Enemy was in, they re&s;olve to at|tack <HI>Barcam.</HI></P>
<P>The King cau&s;ed &s;ome of his <HI>Co&s;&s;acks</HI> to ad|vance, and the Duke added five Battalions of <HI>Starenberg,</HI> of <HI>Grana,</HI> and <HI>Baden,</HI> all under the conduct of Count <HI>Starenberg.</HI> This detachment was &s;carce ordered, when the Duke, who was approached to the Fort to in&s;pect it, was adver|ti&s;ed, that the Bridge upon the <HI>Danube</HI> was bro|ken by the precipitate flight of the fir&s;t Run|aways, and that the crowding in <HI>Barkam,</HI> and upon the &s;ide to the River, were &s;o great, that they &s;eemed to be packed upon each other. He ha&s;ted thither, and would lo&s;e no time upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion. He gave Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Ba|den</HI> orders to di&s;mount the Regiments of Dra|goons, of <HI>Schults, Comfettein,</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;tell,</HI> and to march to the Fort on that &s;ide to make a &s;econd Attack. The command was in&s;tantly executed, and having &s;ent &s;ome parties of Foot by Water, and five pieces of Cannon charged with Car|trages; he ordered that the Fort &s;hould be a&s;|&s;aulted, whil&s;t the great and &s;mall &s;hot plyed their Vollies upon the Banks of the River. The Turks &s;eeing them&s;elves thus pre&s;&s;ed on all &s;ides, could not with&s;tand the Attack, the place being forced, the Foot and Dragoons entering at the &s;ame time by the ways they attempted it.</P>
<P>The &s;laughter was terrible, though mo&s;t of the defendants, to &s;ave them&s;elves from the fury of the a&s;&s;ailants, precipitated them&s;elves into the <HI>Danube,</HI> &s;ome leap'd in with their Hor&s;es, others tried to pa&s;s by &s;wimming, holding by the Mane and tailes of their Hor&s;es, or &s;ome plank or piece of the broken Bridge, and there were &s;ome who crept over the dead bodies which were held by the cordage and pieces of wood remaining where the breach was. This &s;laughter continuing long, the number of the dead was very great, all that part of the <HI>Danube</HI> near the &s;hore, not being very rapid, being filled with them; all the &s;urface of the River, where large&s;t, being covered with cloaths, and the equipage of Men and Hor&s;es, and there did not e&s;cape above &s;even or 800 of all this multitude, who found their pre&s;ervation in the king of a Redoubt which was at <HI>Barcam,</HI> where they had put them&s;elves, and from whence they deman|ded quarter, and had it.</P>
<P>The Town being garri&s;oned with <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Poles,</HI> Count <HI>Staremberg,</HI> &s;eeing the&s;e two Nati|ons were ready to murther each other for the booty, removed the Imperiali&s;ts, having only the <HI>Poles</HI> there, who awhile after burnt <HI>Barcam,</HI> and all the Palli&s;ado's that enclo&s;ed it, becau&s;e the Turks had placed the Heads of the <HI>Poles</HI> &s;lain in the late Engagement upon the tops of them.</P>
<P>Count <HI>Tekely,</HI> who had orders from the Grand Vi&s;ier to joyn with the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Buda</HI> at <HI>Barkam,</HI> was advanced upon the Mountains within two miles of it, but being informed by tho&s;e he &s;ent to di&s;cover what the Chri&s;tians did, of what was pa&s;&s;ed, he retired with much diligence.</P>
<P>By Letters from <HI>Gran,</HI> as al&s;o by the relation of Pri&s;oners, there were not 3000 men of all this detachment of 14000 Hor&s;e, and 1200 Ja|ni&s;aries &s;aved. They were the Hower of their Army, commanded by the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI> of <HI>Buda, Haly</HI> Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Aleppo,</HI> the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Sili&s;tria,</HI> and &s;ome Aga's The booty was great, above &s;ix thou|&s;and Hor&s;es being taken, and the Tymbals and the Baggage which the <HI>Poles</HI> had left, were re|covered.</P>
<P>This Victoty did not only re-a&s;&s;ure the <HI>Poles,</HI> but put the Male-contents into a de&s;pondency, and did &s;o &s;trongly increa&s;e the di&s;orders in the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Army, that the Grand Vi&s;ier, unable to ma&s;ter them, was obliged to retire.</P>
<P>The next thing the Chri&s;tians undertook, was the Siege of <HI>Gran,</HI> though the Duke had need of all his Rea&s;ons and elocution to per&s;wade the King of <HI>Poland</HI> to it, but having at length con|&s;ented, and the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Forces being come up, three Batteries were forthwith rai&s;ed; and ten great Guns were by force of men, as al&s;o eight Mortars drawn up the Mountains of <HI>Martin</HI> and <HI>Thomas,</HI> de&s;erted by the Enemy. The Ca&s;tle was &s;trongly battered on the Gate, on the <HI>Buda</HI> &s;ide great quantity of Bombs were thrown in, and the &s;hooting la&s;ted all day. The Imperia|li&s;ts advanced to the Ditch, and lodged there on the &s;ide of the <HI>Bavarian</HI> approaches. They advanced to the foot of the Wall, which lookt towards <HI>Barcam,</HI> and about five in the evening, &s;ome commanded Battalions of the Imperiali&s;ts attack'd the City on the other extremity, and carried it without re&s;i&s;tance; for as much as the Enemy having retired, contented them&s;elves to defend it by their great firing from the Ca&s;tle, from whence the very &s;ills of the Hou&s;es are di&s;covered.</P>
<P>The Imperiali&s;ts being ma&s;ters of the City, the <HI>Bavarians</HI> in the Night gained the foot of the Ca&s;tle, where they fell to Mining, whil&s;t the Imperiali&s;ts leaped into the Mote, and lodged there. Several men were lo&s;t there by the de|fendants Bombs, Granadoes, Stones, &amp;c. which they continually threw among&s;t them, whil&s;t they were covering them&s;elves. The Cannon beginning to make a breach about Ten Clock, and the Miner at work, a Summons was &s;ent in by a <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Pri&s;oner, with offer of goods and life, if they would &s;urrender the place before the day was ended. The be&s;ieged demanded till the morrow, which being refu&s;ed, the firing of the Artillery, Musquets, and Bombs were re-doubled. They pa&s;&s;ed the Moat, made two Lodgments, by favour whereof they attacked the Miner in a &s;econd place on the <HI>Martinberg</HI> &s;ide. This advantage obliged the <HI>Turks</HI> to &s;end an Officer about Eleven at Night to declare, that they accepted the offer which had been made them, demanding Ho&s;tages whil&s;t the Ca|pitulations were a making, and offering theirs.</P>
<P>The 27th, the Ho&s;tages being delivered, it was agreed, that the Garri&s;on &s;hould march out with Arms and Baggage, and that it &s;hould be conducted in &s;afety to <HI>Buda</HI> and <HI>Vicegrade;</HI> that the Artillery and Munitions of War and Victu|als &s;hould remain in the place, and that the Turks &s;hould deliver up their Chri&s;tian Pri|&s;oners.</P>
<P>The impre&s;&s;ion that the battel of <HI>Barcam</HI> had made; the vigor and readine&s;s wherewith they had gained the foot of the Walls, the Grand Vi&s;ier's retreat, the Bombs which were thrown without cea&s;ing, into a place &s;o full of People as this, had cau&s;ed &s;o much terror and &s;o much confu&s;ion, that though there were above 4000 effective men in the Garri&s;on, commanded by two Ba&s;&s;a's, a Bey, and many Officers, we have &s;een a place reduced in five days, which in the two former Sieges had held out &s;everal Months, with weaker Garri&s;ons, again&s;t more numerous Armies.</P>
<P>The &s;ea&s;on being too far advanced for further action, the Allies returned home, and the <HI>Poles,</HI> together with the Imperiali&s;ts marched into their Winter-Quarters.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Grand Vi&s;ier being come to Court, told the Grand Seignior the &s;ame things he had writ to him again&s;t the Ba&s;&s;a
<PB N="307" REF="150">of Buda, and per&s;waded him to approve of the rigor wherewith he had treated him. He al&s;o accu&s;ed Count <HI>Tekely</HI> of having ill &s;econded him; and finally, he knew &s;o well to ju&s;tifie his conduct with his Ma&s;ter, that he hindered the Widdow of that Ba&s;&s;a, who was his Highne&s;s's Si&s;ter, to complain again&s;t him for &s;o barbarous an action, and procured an Order to be &s;ent her from the <HI>Sultan</HI> to go immediately to <HI>Adrianople</HI> without &s;eeing him. When this Prince&s;s arri|ved there, &s;he found the <HI>Sultana Valide</HI> dead, which cau&s;ed her a &s;en&s;ible di&s;plea&s;ure; becau&s;e &s;he had relied much upon the credit of this Prin|ce&s;s, who having a great aver&s;ion for <HI>Cara Mu|&s;tafa,</HI> would not have been wanting in counte|nancing the vengeance &s;he would take of this Mini&s;ter; but &s;he learn'd from <HI>Ki&s;ler Aga&s;i,</HI> or the chief of the black Eunukes, that <HI>Sultana Valide</HI> had charged him upon her Death-bed, to tell the Grand Seignior upon his return to <HI>Adrianople,</HI> that <HI>Cara Mu&s;tapha</HI> had a de&s;ign to make him&s;elf Emperour of the We&s;t, grounded upon a Prediction told him, that he &s;hould one day be Ma&s;ter of one of the greate&s;t Empires of the World. But whether this Prediction were true, or that the <HI>Sultana Valide</HI> had invented it to de&s;troy the Vi&s;ier, the news of it did extremely comfort the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Buda's</HI> Widdow, who wait|ed the return of the <HI>Sultan</HI> with impatience, to execute the de&s;ign which &s;he had again&s;t this Mini&s;ter, and revenge the lo&s;s of her Husband by his death.</P>
<P>The &s;ea&s;on being far advanced, the Grand Seignior, leaving <HI>Kara Mu&s;tapha</HI> at <HI>Belgrade</HI> to take care of his Army, and the places in <HI>Hun|gary,</HI> during the Winter quarter, returned to <HI>Adrianople.</HI></P>
<P>As the Chri&s;tians got every day &s;ome new ad|vantages over the <HI>Turks,</HI> and that the Grand Vi&s;ier did nothing to repell them, his &s;ecret Enemies, and principally the <HI>Ki&s;ler Aga&s;i,</HI> and the <HI>Kaimacan,</HI> who was jealous of his greatne&s;s, took oca&s;ion hence to decry the conduct of the Grand Vi&s;ier unto their Ma&s;ter. At this time Count <HI>Tekely,</HI> who was accu&s;tomed to receive great Sub&s;idies from the Port, and who had his Spies near his Highne&s;s, by whom he was faith|fully adverti&s;ed of all that happened, knowing that he had been rendered &s;u&s;pect to his High|ne&s;s, and that there was no more mention of &s;ending him Supplies as u&s;ual, did by his Let|ters omit nothing for his ju&s;tification, but to no purpo&s;e. His Letters did not di&s;abu&s;e the Grand Seignior, who entirely believing what he had received from <HI>Kara Mu&s;tapha</HI> at <HI>Belgrade,</HI> was per&s;waded that this Count was of Intelligence with the Imperiali&s;ts. <HI>Tekely</HI> &s;eeing no middle betwixt his ruine and his ju&s;tification, took the mo&s;t dangerous Party. He went <HI>Incognito</HI> to <HI>Adrianople,</HI> and having by the credit of <HI>Ki&s;ler Aga&s;i,</HI> who was his particular friend, found means of admi&s;&s;ion to the <HI>Sultans</HI> pre&s;ence, be|fore whom, pro&s;trated with his face upon the Earth, he declared to him that he brought him his Head, and that he would rather lo&s;e it, than be expo&s;ed to the calumny of his Enemies, and to the di&s;grace of his Protector. <HI>Tekely's</HI> boldne&s;s look'd well. The Grand Seignior gave ear to his rea&s;ons, and judged by the relation that he made him, that all the misfortunes that hap|pened at the Siege of <HI>Vienna,</HI> and &s;ince, ought to be imputed to the ill conduct of his Vi&s;ier. He permitted <HI>Tekely</HI> to return, a&s;&s;uring him of the protection he demanded, and engaged him&s;elf to &s;end him &s;uch powerful Succours, that he &s;hould in a little time be in a condition to repair with advantage all the lo&s;&s;es he had &s;uffered.</P>
<P>And now they begin to make complaints a|gain&s;t the Vi&s;ier, and the lo&s;s of <HI>Gran</HI> did not a little contribute to his ruine. The Janizaries, that the Vi&s;ier's &s;ecret enemies had cau&s;ed to a&s;|&s;emble tumultuarily, and demand his Head, under pretence that he had abandoned their Companions in the Trenches at <HI>Vienna;</HI> and this was a killing blow, &s;o that the death of <HI>Kara Mu&s;tapha</HI> was re&s;olved in a Divan, which the Grand Seignior had cau&s;ed to be a&s;&s;embled to that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>This fatal Commi&s;&s;ion was given <HI>Chiaoux</HI> Ba&s;&s;a, and to <HI>Kapiglier Kiaia,</HI> who immediately took Po&s;t for <HI>Belgrade.</HI> They arrived there the 25th of <HI>December,</HI> and addre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves to the Aga of the Janizaries, they communicated the Emperours Orders to him, which implied that he &s;hould give them all nece&s;&s;ary a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The Aga di&s;po&s;ed &s;uch as depended on him to obey, and went with the&s;e two Officers into the Grand Vi&s;ier's hou&s;e. <HI>Cara Mu&s;tapha,</HI> who per|ceived them from his Chamber, did quickly &s;uppo&s;e that his Enemies had taken advantage of his ab&s;ence to ruine him, and tho&s;e that he &s;aw coming were to execute the Arre&s;t of his death. Some Officers, who owed him their for|tune, being then with him, and having heard him &s;ay what he thought, propo&s;ed to him to refu&s;e the Door to the Aga, and them that ac|companied him: they repre&s;ented to him that he was beloved by the Souldiers, and if he ap|peared but in his defence, he would in&s;tantly &s;ee a number of brave men for his defence.</P>
<P>But this great Mini&s;ter, who&s;e life &s;eemed odious to him after the affront which he recei|ved before <HI>Vienna,</HI> and who knew well, he could but defer his death for few days, being incir|cled with the Enemies of his Religion, who would not fail to profit by the divi&s;ion of his Troops, believed that by his la&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his Highne&s;s orders, he ought to di&s;abu&s;e tho&s;e who believed him little attach'd to the Law, or rather he found him&s;elf &s;o irre&s;olute in &s;o pre&s;&s;ing a danger, that the <HI>Sultans</HI> three Officers entered his Chamber before he had taken his la&s;t re&s;olution. He endeavoured to hide the di&s;|orders of his Soul, and after he had returned them their civilities, he asked the cau&s;e of their coming. The Aga taking the word, told him, that his Highne&s;s had &s;ent for the Seal of the Empire, which he had entru&s;ted him with, and &s;hewed him the order in Writing. At the &s;ame time the Vi&s;ier opening his bo&s;om drew it out, which he pre&s;ented to him with re&s;pect, asking whether they had any thing el&s;e to require from him? he was obliged to render the Standard, which he did in the &s;ame fashion; and having yet again demanded, whether they would have any thing el&s;e, the three Officers an&s;wered him only with tears, letting him at the &s;ame time &s;ee in writing the <HI>Buyurds</HI> or Command, where|by the Grand Seignior would have his Head. <HI>Kara Mu&s;tapha</HI> was not affrighted, being already prepared for it. He only asked, if the might not be permitted to &s;ay his Prayers. The Offi|cers an&s;wered him, that they had no orders to refu&s;e him that con&s;oiation. He ordered his People to retire, that he might pray with le&s;s di&s;traction, and when he had fini&s;hed, they re|entered again. He then drew a Paper out of his bo&s;om, which he gave to the Aga, to render it to his Highne&s;s. It is believed that it was a Billet, by which the <HI>Sultan</HI> promi&s;ed him never to put him to death, which he would make no u&s;e of, judging it u&s;ele&s;s, being he was too far from the Grand Seignior to undr&s;tand his in|ten&s;ions. He then &s;at upon the brink of the So|fa,
<PB N="308" REF="151">whereof he lift up the Carpet, to the end to be only upon the Plank, demanding he might be &s;trangled by his own Executioner, which was granted. After a few Moments to di&s;po&s;e of him&s;elf, he called the Executioner, and told him he &s;hould be quick, and not let him lan|gui&s;h; he &s;aid al&s;o, that the Grand Seignior would think on him after his Death. The Ex|ecutioner having put the &s;tring about his Neck, he him&s;elf di&s;entangled it, &s;aying, it was not nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould hold his hands. As &s;oon as he was dead, the Executioner cut off his Head, and flead it, filling the Skin with hacked Straw, which was put into a Box, and carried to <HI>Adri|anople,</HI> and given to the Sultan, who received it without any great Emotion, as he was coming from hunting.</P>
<P>The Vi&s;iers Corps was carried out of his Chamber, and expo&s;ed under a Pavilion to be &s;een of all Men. At the &s;ame time they &s;ei&s;ed on his principal Officers, who were brought to <HI>Adrianople.</HI> Of the&s;e the <HI>Reiz Effendi</HI> was hang'd, <HI>Mauro Cordato</HI> his Interpreter put in the Ca&s;tle of the &s;even Towers at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> having fir&s;t been &s;poiled of his Money and Jewels.</P>
<P>There were found in the Trea&s;ury of this Mini&s;ter, ten or twelve Milions in Money, Moveables and Jewels, which is very con&s;idera|ble, if the prodigious Expences of Pre&s;ents be con|&s;idered; the&s;e Spoils, and tho&s;e of &s;ome of the Vi&s;iers Officers, and of the Tefterder, who was likewi&s;e &s;trangled, amounted to fourteen Milli|ons, which came all into the Grand Seigniors Pur&s;e. He refu&s;ed to con&s;ent that this Moneys &s;hould be employed to pay the Troops, and re|e&s;tabli&s;h the Affairs of <HI>Hungary,</HI> although all the Divan was of that Opinion. The Sultan would neither &s;uffer them to open his Trea&s;ury, which is the great re&s;ource of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Emperours, and replyed to them that repre&s;ented to him the nece&s;&s;ity of doing it, that they mu&s;t make u&s;e of the accu&s;tomed Revenues, and if that did not &s;uffice, it was for his Council to &s;earch out other ways to &s;upply it. And yet he was plea&s;ed to give all the Vi&s;iers immoveables to his Chil|dren. This Humour of his Highne&s;s, and the Difficulties which were fore&s;een to &s;ettle the Af|fairs of the Empire, dimini&s;hed the heat of &s;uch who might pretend to the Employment of Grand Vi&s;ier. The <HI>Ki&s;ler Aga&s;i,</HI> who was always in great Credit, and who fancied, though without any ground, that the Grand Seignior had thoughts of placing him in this Po&s;t, declared before hand, that he would not accept of this Office, know|ing that he had not Capacity enough to bear the weight of it.</P>
<P><HI>Solyman Aga Selietar,</HI> who was his Highne&s;&s;es true Favorite, and who judg'd he &s;hould be al|ways powerful enough whil&s;t he had his Ma|&s;ters Favour, &s;ignified to the Sultan, who offer|ed to make him Grand Vi&s;ier, that all his Am|bition was to plea&s;e him, and that he e&s;teemed more the waiting upon his Per&s;on, than to di|vide his Cares betwixt his Prince and the State, as he &s;hould be obliged to do, if he accepted the charge wherewith he would honour him. So obliging a denyal augmenting the e&s;teem and affection which the Grand Seignior had for him, di&s;po&s;ed him to name <HI>Ibrahim Aga,</HI> who was <HI>Kaymacan,</HI> and formerly called <HI>Kara Kiaia,</HI> for this high Employment.</P>
<P>The Chri&s;tians continuing their Progre&s;s in <HI>Hungary,</HI> obliged this new Grand Vi&s;ier to a&s;|&s;emble the Divan very often, to find a way to re-e&s;tabli&s;h their Affairs. He propo&s;ed the ma|king of a Peace with the Emperour, and to con|tinue the Trevis which <HI>Kara Mu&s;tapha</HI> had vio|lated without any lawful pretence, and to carry the War into <HI>Poland,</HI> to revenge them&s;elves on King <HI>John,</HI> for the ill &s;ucce&s;s of the Siege of <HI>Vi|enna.</HI> But the Sultan, who had promi&s;ed Count <HI>Tekely</HI> that he would not abandon him, was of a contrary &s;entiment. <HI>Kara Kiaia</HI> urging his Opinion with too much heat, the Sultan grew &s;o angry with him, that he was judged lo&s;t, which gave room to that fal&s;e report that ran of him that he was &s;trangled, and that <HI>Kana Houglou Camaikan</HI> of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> was put in his place.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the Officers of the Garri&s;ons being changed, the new Vi&s;ier employed all his dili|gence to rai&s;e &s;uch Forces again&s;t Spring, as might &s;alve the di&s;graces of the la&s;t Campaign, which yet they could not compa&s;s, the People being dejected even to Con&s;ternation at &s;o ma|ny lo&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide, the Chri&s;tians having hap|pily fini&s;hed their Campaign, and taken their Quarters in <HI>Hungary,</HI> u&s;ed great diligence to pro|cure Moneys, to &s;eparate the <HI>Hungarians</HI> from the Port, and to make new Alliances.</P>
<P>There was but the <HI>Pope</HI> that could travel ef|fectually in the fir&s;t of the&s;e things, &s;eeing the other Princes of the Empire had enough to do for them&s;elves, as long as the differences with <HI>France</HI> were not accommodated, be&s;ides the Pro|te&s;tants could obtain no advantage for their Re|ligion.</P>
<P>To effect the &s;econd point, a general Act of Oblivion was publi&s;hed by the Emperours com|mand, with pardon to all that would return to their Obedience, and Commi&s;&s;ioners being &s;ent to <HI>Presburg</HI> to receive their Submi&s;&s;ions, very many of the Nobility, Counties, and Towns were re&s;tored to their Duty as at the beginning, though <HI>Tekely</HI> would not, and the chief Towns in upper <HI>Hungary</HI> for fear of him, did not as yet dare to declare them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But the third de&s;ign had better Succe&s;s, for however the <HI>Czars</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;covia</HI> would not give ear to the Emperours Invitation and Propo&s;iti|ons of Alliance made him by his Amba&s;&s;ador <HI>Blomberg,</HI> yet the <HI>Venetians,</HI> &s;hewing a great In|clination to be revenged of the lo&s;&s;es they had &s;uffered by the Wars of <HI>Candy,</HI> ea&s;ily con&s;ented to the accompli&s;hment of the League between the Emperour, the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and the <HI>Ve|netians.</HI></P>
<P>This Alliance was to be offen&s;ive; none of the concerned &s;hould treat &s;eparately upon any Conditions what&s;oever; that this League &s;hall tend to no other thing but to make War again&s;t the Turks; the Emperour and the King of <HI>Po|land</HI> &s;hall act by Land with all their Forces, and the Republick of <HI>Venice</HI> with a Naval Army at Sea, and a Land Army in <HI>Dalmatia;</HI> that the War be made by diver&s;ion, the Emperour &s;hall endeavour to recover <HI>Hungary,</HI> the <HI>Poles Kaminiec,</HI> and all the <HI>&V;kraine,</HI> and <HI>Venice</HI> all &s;he has lo&s;t, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Whil&s;t this was in concluding, there came News to the Imperial Court, of a very great defeat the <HI>Co&s;&s;acks</HI> had given the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tar|tars,</HI> the Chieftains of the <HI>Tartars</HI> being both &s;lain, and <HI>Haly Beg,</HI> who commanded the <HI>Turks,</HI> taken Pri&s;oner, who, though he offered a hundred thou&s;and Crowns for his Ran&s;om, was &s;lain by the quarrelling <HI>Co&s;&s;ack</HI> in the heat of their con|te&s;t about him.</P>
<P>But now the Sea&s;on did invite both &s;ides into the Field, where the Chri&s;tians were chiefly Aggre&s;&s;ors. The Chri&s;tian Army in the begin|ning of <HI>June</HI> a&s;&s;embled at their general Rende|vous betwixt <HI>Schinta</HI> and <HI>Shella,</HI> to the num|ber
<PB N="309" REF="151">of thirty thou&s;and Men, from whence, after &s;ome &s;tay, they pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Danube</HI> near <HI>Gran;</HI> it was believed that the de&s;ign was formed again&s;t <HI>Newhau&s;el,</HI> and the rather, becau&s;e it had been &s;o greatly &s;treightned by General <HI>Mercy,</HI> who had block'd it up all the Winter, and reduced it to the Condition, as was &s;uppo&s;ed, of a voluntary &s;urrender. But it was at length di&s;covered that <HI>Buda</HI> was at the bottom of the De&s;ign, as a thing of greater Con&s;equence, being therefore to leave no Place behind them, the Army was tran&s;por|ted to <HI>Vicegrade,</HI> a place &s;cituate upon the <HI>Danube,</HI> having left their Baggage under the Cannon of <HI>Gran;</HI> and having without much labour ren|dred them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the City, the Turks that were in the Ca&s;tle &s;urrendered the next day, marching out to the number of &s;even hun|dred and forty men. In the mean time, the Turks of <HI>Alba Regalis,</HI> and the Neighbour Garri&s;ons, to the number of &s;ix thou&s;and, unexpectedly at|tack'd the Baggage at <HI>Gran,</HI> but were &s;o rudely received, that having lo&s;t two hundred of their Men, and four Colours, they were forced to give back. Major General <HI>Halloweil</HI> of the Im|periali&s;ts was &s;lain in this Fight.</P>
<P>But the Turks, &s;ollicitous for <HI>Newhau&s;el,</HI> and finding they could not &s;ufficiently relieve it with &s;mall Parties, re&s;olved to attempt it with an Army, and being advanced as far as <HI>Vacia,</HI> the Duke re&s;olved to oppo&s;e them. To this purpo&s;e he &s;et forwards, and found them drawn up in Battalia upon the heights near the Town. The place was of difficult acce&s;s, having on the left the <HI>Danube,</HI> and a large Mora&s;s, and the right &s;ecured by a Wood. The Duke having embat|telled his men, moved directly towards the Ene|my, and about Eleven of the Clock pa&s;&s;ed the Mora&s;s, without any great oppo&s;ition, till being come upon the heights, they were then charged with great fury, but the Turks not being able to break them the fir&s;t time, they bravely at|tacked them the &s;econd, and third time; but with like &s;ucce&s;s, &s;till repelled, e&s;pecially the third time with great lo&s;s, and forced to &s;ave them&s;elves by flight. The Foot &s;aved them|&s;elves in the Ca&s;tle, but were forced to &s;urren|der at di&s;cretion, after three hours re&s;i&s;tance. <HI>Novigrade</HI> was hereupon quitted by the Turks, and as &s;oon po&s;&s;e&s;t by the Imperiali&s;ts.</P>
<P>This Victory animated the Chri&s;tians to pro|&s;ecute their march to <HI>Pe&s;t,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Jun. <HI>27.</HI></NOTE> whither being come, they ca&s;t a great number of Bombs into the Town, with that &s;ucce&s;s, that the fire taking in &s;everal places of it, frightned the Garri&s;on &s;o, that taking their be&s;t moveables with them, they fled into <HI>Buda,</HI> after they had al&s;o reduced &s;ome Hou&s;es in the Town to a&s;hes, and fired the Bridge behind them. But the Chri&s;tians taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Pe&s;t,</HI> quenched the fire, repaired the fortifications, and battered <HI>Buda</HI> with the Artillery they found in the place.</P>
<P>Hitherto fortune had been &s;o favourable to the Imperiali&s;ts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Siege of <HI>Buda.</HI></NOTE> that they began to think no|thing in&s;uperable to their courage. This opi|nion made them pa&s;s the <HI>Danube</HI> again, and un|dertake the Siege of <HI>Offen,</HI> or <HI>Buda,</HI> the Capital of the Kingdom, &s;ometimes the Re&s;idence of the Kings of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and now of the Ba&s;&s;a's, that govern that wealthy Kingdom with no le&s;s authority. After &s;ome ruffling and skirmi&s;hes, the City was inve&s;ted, and the Suburbs taken without any great oppo&s;ition. The Turks like|wi&s;e quitted St. <HI>Gerards</HI> Hill, and the be&s;iegers began to batter the Walls with their Artillery.</P>
<P>The Turks abroad were not idle, for having got twenty thou&s;and Men together, they were re&s;olved to attempt the relief of <HI>Buda.</HI> But the Chri&s;tians having left all their Foot, with what Hor&s;e was nece&s;&s;ary to continue the Siege, they marched with the re&s;t of the Cavalry, one thou&s;and Foot under the command of Count <HI>Aversberg,</HI> and two thou&s;and five hundred <HI>Hu&s;|&s;ars</HI> of Count <HI>E&s;terha&s;is.</HI> The Duke marched all Night to find out the Enemy, who, though well trenched, at &s;ight of the Chri&s;tians came out of their Camp, and embattell'd them&s;elves for their defence. The di&s;pute la&s;ted near four hours, the Turks making &s;everal motions to gain the Flanks of the Enemy, which being per|ceived, the Chri&s;tians u&s;ed all po&s;&s;ible diligence to prevent them, and engaging at length, after a &s;harp fight, the Infidels being di&s;ordered, were put to flight, and &s;o clo&s;ely pur&s;ued, that not only their Camp and Cannon were taken, but at lea&s;t four thou&s;and of them &s;lain, and the great Standard, the badge of the Grand Vi&s;ier's dignity al&s;o &s;urpri&s;ed.</P>
<P>After this Victory, the Duke returning to the Siege, &s;ummoned the place, but received for an|&s;wer, that the Governour had in the pre&s;ence of his Me&s;&s;engers cau&s;ed forty Chri&s;tian Slaves to be hewed in pieces, &s;aying, he wi&s;hed he could do as much to all the Chri&s;tian Army. In re|venge of this, the Chri&s;tians a&s;&s;aulted the place, but in vain, though upon a &s;econd attempt they carried the lower Town, with their Swords in their hands, notwith&s;tanding the oppo&s;ition they found was great. They rai&s;ed a Battery there of twenty four Cannon, and &s;eventeen Mortars, from whence, as al&s;o St. <HI>Gerards</HI> hill, they battered the City. Nor were the be&s;ieged idle, who made a brave &s;ally upon the Be&s;iegers, wherein they &s;lew &s;ome hundreds of them, with &s;everal con&s;iderable Officers, be&s;ides the wounded.</P>
<P>The Chri&s;tian Army beginning to want For|rage, they made a Bridge to pa&s;s to the I&s;le of St. <HI>Margaret,</HI> from whence they might be the better provided with all things. Many were the attempts, the batteries, the &s;allies, and endea|vours on both &s;ides. The Chri&s;tians endeavou|red to hinder the Turks, though in vain, from watering at the <HI>Danube.</HI> The Chri&s;tians &s;prung a Mine by the great Tower, which did indeed take effect, but it was found that the Turks were too well provided to hazard an a&s;&s;ault. About mid-<HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> the Governour, or Vi&s;ier of <HI>Buda, Kara Mehemet,</HI> was kill'd with a &s;hot he received in his face, a Per&s;on very brave, and very know|ing. <HI>Ephraim</HI> Ba&s;&s;a &s;ucceeded him in the Go|vernment, but did not enjoy it long, being like|wi&s;e &s;lain with a Cannon Bullet, &s;o that the Chief command was devolved upon the Aga of the Janizaries.</P>
<P>As the attack was vigorous, &s;o the defence was brave, the Turks continually vexing the Chri&s;tians with their Alarms and Sallies, who on the other &s;ide continued their approaches with great re&s;olution, but their Foot being much &s;pent, it was judged advi&s;able not to hazard a General a&s;&s;ault, before the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Forces, which were daily expected, were come up.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Serasquier Ba&s;&s;a formed a de&s;ign to make a diver&s;ion &s;ome other way, in order to which he marches towards the fron|tiers of <HI>Croatia,</HI> where General <HI>Le&s;ley</HI> was cam|ped, who had be&s;ieged <HI>Virovitza</HI> in <HI>July,</HI> beaten the relief de&s;igned for their &s;uccour, and there|upon had the place &s;urrendered to him upon compo&s;ition. Having now notice of the Sera|&s;quier's de&s;ign, he went and po&s;ted him&s;elf within half a League off his Camp, near a Bridge that was lay'd over the <HI>Danube</HI> at <HI>Turanowitz.</HI> A while after the Turks approached, who charged
<PB N="310" REF="152">with great fury eight hundred Croats, newly come to the Imperial Camp, but with their ac|cu&s;tomed misfortune. They however returned immediately to the fight, and forced the Croats to retire, leaving them three Standards for pri&s;e, &s;o that being animated with this advantage, they would attempt more, and attacked the Imperi|ali&s;ts in their <HI>Post;</HI> but they were &s;o ill received, that they were obliged to retire with the lo&s;s of five hundred men, which were killed upon the place. The Chri&s;tians lo&s;t two hundred.</P>
<P>Though this Siege, for the Greatne&s;s and Fame of it, de&s;erves to be de&s;cribed in all its par|ticulars, the Approaches, the Attacks, the Mines, the Battels, the Batteries, the Breaches of the Chri&s;tians being carried on with &s;o much Va|lour and Con&s;tancy, that it amazed the wonder|ing World; yet the Greatne&s;s of the Garri&s;on, the Scituation and Strength of the Place, the re|iterated Succours that were brought in, a potent Army commanded by a <HI>Seraskier,</HI> within the noi&s;e of their Guns, yea, oft-times their view; a vigorous and intrepid Courage in the Defen|dants, frequent and furious Sallies, Counter|mines, and the advance of a wet Sea&s;on &s;o fa|vourable to them, rendred all the Endeavours of the Be&s;iegers fruitle&s;s, and forced them to a Retreat.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> had indeed brought with his Per&s;on, a con&s;iderable recruit to the Impe|riali&s;ts, and they performed all that Courage could &s;ugge&s;t; but being the fatal moment of the reducing of this Capital City of the King|dom was not yet come, we will tran&s;mit the Hi&s;tory of it till then, when the &s;ame great Atchievements were in a manner acted over again, and indeed by the &s;ame Generals on the &s;ide of the Chri&s;tians, but with better fortune.</P>
<P>The Siege had la&s;ted from the fourteenth of <HI>July,</HI> till the fir&s;t of <HI>November,</HI> at which time the Chri&s;tians having tran&s;ported their Baggage, their &s;ick, and &s;ome pieces of Artillery to the I&s;le of St. <HI>Andrew;</HI> the Army &s;ending their great Cannon, their Ammunition, and the re&s;t of their Baggage by Water, for want of draught-Hor&s;es, though well convoyed, followed them|&s;elves in a Body uninterrupted, and marched to their Winter Quarters, the <HI>Bavarians</HI> into up|per <HI>Hungary,</HI> and the Imperiali&s;ts into both the upper and lower <HI>Hungary, Bohemia, Sile&s;ia, &amp;c.</HI> ac|cording to their Repartitions.</P>
<P>The Turks attempted nothing upon the Ar|my in their retreat, but brought near a thou&s;and Pri&s;oners, which were left in the I&s;le of St. <HI>Mar|garet,</HI> into the City, not &s;ingly triumphing for &s;o &s;ignal a deliverance.</P>
<P>Such was the end of this bloody Siege, where, following the common Opinion, the Emperour lo&s;t twenty thou&s;and Men, and among&s;t them a great number of Officers.

<P>The Turks recovered their Garri&s;ons of <HI>Pe&s;t</HI> and <HI>Vacia,</HI> without any great difficulty, but in exchange the Count of <HI>Zober</HI> took the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Suran</HI> near <HI>Newheu&s;el.</HI></P>

The fir&s;t of <HI>August,</HI> a great Breach was made in the Wall, one of their Bulwarks being much ruined, and four of their Pieces of <HI>Cannon</HI> rendred u&s;ele&s;s to the Be&s;ieged; be&s;ides, the Town flamed in &s;everal parts, being fired by the Bombs; by favour of which advantages the <HI>Venetians</HI> advanced their approaches &s;o well, that they began already to fill the Ditch, and making every thing ready for a general a&s;&s;ault.

<P>And thus this Ne&s;t of Pirates, (the <HI>Leucade</HI> of the Ancients) about &s;eventy miles round, and well peopled, and in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Turks ever &s;ince <HI>Mahomet</HI> the &s;econd's time, was re-taken in le&s;s than three Weeks, with &s;o incon&s;iderable a lo&s;s.

<P>The next day the Captain <HI>Monetta,</HI> who was come with twenty four Barks and Brigantines, landed his Troops, being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the ap|proach of the Gallies, which hindred the Turks from daring to appear upon the &s;hore, before the <HI>Venetians</HI> were drawn up into Battalia by General <HI>Strozoldo,</HI> and had forced five hundred Spahis, who came to charge them, to retire. They took the Ca&s;tle without difficulty, and po&s;ted them&s;elves upon a height which com|manded the City. The General thereupon &s;um|moned the place, but the Officer who command|ed in chief in the ab&s;ence of <HI>Saba</HI> Ba&s;&s;a, refu&s;ed the Letter and Me&s;&s;enger, &s;hooting at the later, upon confidence of being relieved by his Go|vernour.

They demanded the &s;ame Con|ditions with them at St. <HI>Maur,</HI> though but thir|ty of the principal were &s;uffered to go out with Arms and Baggage, the re&s;t being only allowed what they could carry about them. There were found in this place forty &s;ix pieces of Can|non, and much Provi&s;ion.

On the Imperiali&s;ts &s;ide, the Duke cau&s;ed two Batteries to be rai&s;ed, both on the right of his Approaches, whereon they worked the whole Night; and though the Enemy continued to &s;hoot their Cannon without cea&s;ing, there were but very few killed or wounded. In &s;hort, the Approaches on both &s;ides were carried on with &s;uch care, and indu&s;try, and courage, the Duke &s;eldom leaving the Trenches till very far in the Night, but a&s;&s;i&s;ting and encouraging the Soul|diery by his pre&s;ence and authority, that maugre all the brave oppo&s;ition of the Garri|&s;on, and their perpetual firing and &s;allies, the works were continued to the very Mote on both &s;ides, &s;trengthned not only with Lines of Com|munication, with Redoubts, and with multiplied Batteries, but the Water al&s;o began to be drained out of the Ditch, by a Canal made for the purpo&s;e. The Be&s;ieged &s;eeing them&s;elves &s;o &s;orely pre&s;&s;ed, among&s;t others made a Sally a|bout three a Clock, with two hundred Men, and &s;urpri&s;ed a Redoubt, wherein there were three hundred of the <HI>Suabian</HI> Troops, who to|gether with their Officers were all cut to pieces. The Turks were &s;o joyed with this &s;ucce&s;s, that they te&s;tified it by a con&s;ort of Mu&s;ick, after their mode, that Night. The Be&s;iegers had endea|voured to pa&s;s the Ditch in Boats, and &s;o carry over their Minery, but the &s;aid Boats were &s;unk by the Defendants, and many &s;lain; and now they begin to fill the &s;aid Moat with Faggots, and Sacks of Wool, and &s;everal Galleries were in making for the &s;ecurer pa&s;&s;age, but they were often burnt and broke by the Be&s;ieged, who o|mitted nothing in their defence. They &s;et fire on the <HI>Bavarians</HI> Gallery with their Arrows, at the &s;harp ends whereof they had fa&s;tned a mix|ture of Sulphur and Pitch, which did not only burn it, but communicating its flames to the neighbouring Battery, burnt it quite down, with the Carriages of four of their battering Pieces, notwith&s;tanding all the diligence and care to the contrary.</P>
<P>It was now the beginning of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> when the Be&s;ieged made a brisk Sally upon them that worked in the advanced Po&s;ts over again&s;t the Gate of <HI>Gran,</HI> killed fifty and hurt many, among which was <HI>Gallenfels</HI> Lieutenant Collonel, <HI>Puge|relli</HI> a Captain, and &s;everal other Officers. The di&s;order was &s;o great, that the Dukes of <HI>Bavaria</HI> and <HI>Lorrain</HI> ran thither, the latter wounding &s;orne of the Run-aways to &s;tay them, and ill treating their Officers for their negligence. Collonel <HI>Burg&s;torf</HI> was killed the Night following in the Approaches, and Count <HI>Souches</HI> dangerou&s;ly wounded in his Neck. The Be&s;ieged had filled up the Canal which the Chri&s;tians had made to drain their Moat, but it was opened again. And now the Approaches, the Galleries, and fil|ling the Ditch had been carried on with &s;uch violence, that the Cannon of the Town were well-nigh all di&s;mounted, and the infinite num|bers of Bombs and Carka&s;&s;es which had been thrown into it, had well-nigh con&s;umed it. The Be&s;ieged had indeed made new Retrenchments in the attack'd Ba&s;tions, where they had re-moun|ted
<PB N="313" REF="153">their Cannon, and u&s;ed them with &s;ucce&s;s: but,</P>
<P>The Breach which the Chri&s;tians had made was great, and the Gallery was carried over. The Moat was filled equal with the largene&s;s of the Breach, and the Mines were a compleating, the Traver&s;es of the Ditch were much enlar|ged, &s;o that the Souldiers might go in a large front to the a&s;&s;ault. And yet they fini&s;h another Battery upon the brink of the Moat, where they planted twenty-four Pieces of Cannon of twenty four pound Ball, to make the Breach yet larger and ea&s;ier. And now all things being prepared for the a&s;&s;ault, they were hindred for two or three days by the great Rains.</P>
<P>In the beginning of this Month, the Ba&s;&s;a had de&s;ired a Parley, but demanded, in ca&s;e of &s;ur|render, that he might march away, not only with their Arms, but all &s;orts of Ammunition and Cannon, and take with him all the Chri|&s;tian Slaves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which conditions the Duke would not hearken to. The Ba&s;&s;a was indeed animated by hopes of relief from the <HI>Seraskier,</HI> who, he knew, was preparing for it, and had already in order to a diver&s;ion be&s;ieged <HI>Gran,</HI> which obliged the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> with the Ele|ctor of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> and forty thou&s;and men, to ri&s;e and go and meet him, leaving eleven thou&s;and Foot and five thou&s;and Hor&s;e, with fifty-eight Pieces of Cannon, and eighteen Mortars, to con|tinue the Siege under the command of Count <HI>Caprara,</HI> Mar&s;hal General of the Field, and the Prince of <HI>Croy,</HI> General of the Artillery.</P>
<P>But to return to <HI>Newheu&s;el,</HI> the fatal <HI>19th.</HI> of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> being come, a re&s;olution was taken to a&s;&s;ault the Town at Eleven of the Clock, to which end two Mines were &s;prung that morn|ing, one at the North Ba&s;tion, and the other up|on the neighbouring Curtain, which, though they had not their wi&s;hed effect, which was to ruine &s;ome retrenchments of the be&s;ieged, yet they did much facilitate the pa&s;&s;age, rendering the a&s;cent more ea&s;ie, &s;o that it was re&s;olved to a&s;&s;ault the place at eight a clock, to this pur|po&s;e three thou&s;and were ordered for the attack in two places, to each fifteen hundred, which were &s;upported by a Re&s;erve of two thou&s;and. The Imperiali&s;ts, had the Van on both &s;ides. Count <HI>Sherffenberg</HI> commanded the right, being followed by them of <HI>Lunenberg</HI> and <HI>Suabia,</HI> and Lieutenant Collonel <HI>Samoraski</HI> the left, with the Troops of <HI>Colen, Bavaria</HI> and <HI>Franconia.</HI> Being thus prepared, they fired from all their Batte|ries, and &s;howred in their Granado's and Bombs from nineteen Mortars, with that impetuou&s;ne&s;s, that they put them within into &s;uch a con&s;ter|nation, that for &s;ome time they dur&s;t &s;carce ap|pear. During this Tempe&s;t, Count <HI>Sherffenberg</HI> fir&s;t enter'd, and po&s;ting him&s;elf upon the Ba|&s;tion, the Sieur <HI>Rummel</HI> about the &s;ame, pu&s;hing at the new breach; the be&s;ieged were forced to give way on all &s;ides, and retreating upon a Cavalier of their Retrenchments, did now the &s;econd time lift up a white Flagg, demanding quarter, but in vain; for the Chri&s;tians ru&s;hing on, put all they met to the Sword; this rendred the re&s;t &s;o de&s;perate, that four hundred of them precipitated them&s;elves into the Town-Ditch, who were all de&s;troyed by the Hor&s;e, &s;o that of all the Garri&s;on which was yet twelve hundred at the beginning of the a&s;&s;ault, &s;carce two hun|dred were &s;aved. <HI>Ha&s;&s;an</HI> Ba&s;&s;a the Governour, de&s;perately wounded in the head and brea&s;t, was brought to the General, and &s;ome ten more of the chief Officers were &s;aved; but the Governor dyed two days after of his wounds.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is taken by A&s;&s;ault.</NOTE> This <HI>Ha&s;&s;an</HI> was a Renegade, Native of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> though a man of extraordinary great parts and re&s;olution.</P>
<P>There were found in the place eighty Pieces of Ordnance, and a great quantity of Ammuni|tion and Provi&s;ion, &s;o that the perpetual noi&s;e of their wants was a fable, the Governour having always a great Magazin of Victuals, as well as Ammunition, which he did not think fit to ex|po&s;e before the Siege. Of the Chri&s;tian Slaves there were but forty remaining, the Turks ha|ving con&s;umed the re&s;t in their works, expo&s;ing them &s;till where the greate&s;t danger was. And although the Be&s;iegers did &s;carce lo&s;e one hun|dred in the &s;torm, yet it is &s;uppo&s;ed, that during the whole Siege, the number of their &s;lain did at lea&s;t equal, if not &s;urmount that of their Ene|mies, yet with this difference, that the Turks lo&s;t all, and they but an incon&s;iderable part of a po|tent Army: excepting the Prince of <HI>Wirtemberg,</HI> greatly lamented by the good and brave, and &s;ome other con&s;iderable Officers.</P>
<P>The <HI>Seraskier,</HI> not imagining the fate of <HI>New|heu&s;el</HI> &s;o near, having with great indu&s;try ga|thered a con&s;iderable Army, e&s;timated betwixt fifty and &s;ixty thou&s;and &s;trong, re&s;oved to at|tempt the relief of it, in order to which he would try the way of diver&s;ion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jul. 30.</NOTE> as le&s;s hazar|dous, and upon that account marches to <HI>Gran,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gran</HI> be|&s;ieged.</NOTE> and though that very day of his arrival an ad|ditional reinforcement of five hundred men, &s;ent thither by the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> got into the Gar|ri&s;on, yet he cau&s;ed the Trenches to be opened, and began to attack the place with his Cannon and Mortars, from Batteries rai&s;ed on St.<HI>George</HI> and St.<HI>Thomas</HI> hills. They al&s;o attackt the low|er Town, but were repul&s;ed with the lo&s;s of two or three hundred men. Several other attempts were made upon the Out-works, but with lo&s;s to the Undertakers, who under&s;tanding that the Enemy advanced, grew more remi&s;s, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them&s;elves of all the Hills by which the Chri|&s;tians might attack them, and thereupon quitted the Siege.</P>
<P>On the <HI>7th</HI> of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> with forty thou&s;and men, pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Danube,</HI> up|on a Bridge near <HI>Comorra,</HI> and arrived the <HI>12th</HI> at a Village that was burnt, where he found the Turks, who had abandoned the Siege of <HI>Gran,</HI> very advantageou&s;ly po&s;ted, having Mountains on each &s;ide, covered with thick Woods, and a Mora&s;s before them, which reached to the <HI>Danube.</HI> Upon the arrival of the Chri&s;tian Army, they skirmi&s;hed near the Mora&s;s, where &s;everal were killed and hurt on both &s;ides. The following Night the Chri&s;tian Army camped in Battalia, and continued &s;o the <HI>13th,</HI> but the Turks alarm'd them about noon, and skirmi&s;hed all the day with the Chri&s;tians right Wing, where the <HI>Hungarians</HI> were, many being &s;lain and wounded on both &s;ides. About noon the Duke comman|ded &s;ome Pieces of Cannon to be planted on a Hill behind his Men, from whence they &s;hot, and the Turks did the &s;ame with two great Pieces, from a height where the Janizaries were. The <HI>14th,</HI> the Turks advanced their Camp to the very Mora&s;s, upon Mountains oppo&s;ite to our advanced Guards, where they made three Batteries with great Cannon, &s;hooting into our very Camp.</P>
<P>The <HI>15th,</HI> a <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Slave e&s;caped out of the Turki&s;h Camp, and gave advice, that the <HI>Seras|kier, Ibrahim</HI> Ba&s;&s;a, was per&s;waded, that the Chri&s;tian Army did not exceed twenty thou&s;and, and thought or a retreat, &s;o that he might ea&s;ily rout them, if he &s;uddenly fell upon them with his that was &s;ixty thou&s;and &s;trong. Upon this advice, the Duke and the other Generals re&s;ol|ved to feign a Retreat, and then, by drawing
<PB N="314" REF="154">the Enemy beyond the Mora&s;s, find a place to fight with them in a pitch'd Battel.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day the Turks advanced towards a place in the Mora&s;s where they might pa&s;s with the Hor&s;e, and took Po&s;t al&s;o in another, where they might make a Bridge for the Foot. As the Chri&s;tians had already re&s;olved to march the day following very early, towards the Bridge of Boats at <HI>Vyfali,</HI> they let flie &s;ome Guns only to amu&s;e the Enemy. In the mean time the Orders for the march of the Army were given in the following manner. Fir&s;t, that the Bag|gage &s;hould part that evening. The left Wing having the Avaunt-Guard, followed by that of the right. Secondly, that the Army &s;hould be ranged in Battalia before day, and march as the place would permit; the two Wings each in two Lines, but if the way would oblige them to file, that then they &s;hould begin by the left Wing, and enlarge them&s;elves as the ground did permit, into their fir&s;t order of Battel.</P>
<P>That the &s;econd line &s;hould have the Avaunt-Guard commanded by Count <HI>Dunewalt,</HI> which was to be followed by the fir&s;t line in the &s;ame manner. At the right of the fir&s;t line Count <HI>Styrum</HI> was to march upon the Mountains (which he had viewed the day before) with his Regi|ment, the Dragoons of <HI>Luneburg,</HI> and all the <HI>Hu&s;&s;ars,</HI> except tho&s;e of <HI>Zoborra,</HI> with &s;ome Field|pieces. That the <HI>Fauconets</HI> &s;hould march before the fir&s;t line, and every Regiment with its Field|pieces, as u&s;ual. And finally, that the Squadrons and the Battalions po&s;ted on the little Mountain on this &s;ide the Mora&s;s, as al&s;o tho&s;e on the Moun|tain to the right, commanded by Major Gene|ral <HI>Tungen,</HI> &s;hould march at the &s;ound of the Tymbals.</P>
<P>About ten at Night they had News that the Turks were pa&s;&s;ing the Mora&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Battel of <HI>Gran. Aug.</HI> 15.</NOTE> whereupon all the Generals took Hor&s;e, <HI>Lorrain</HI> in the right, and the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> in the left, and all being in order, they began to march at the &s;ound of their Trumpets, Tymbals, and Drums, which was continued till the Turks by Favour of the Night charged their left Wing, where|upon the whole Army facing about, they mar|ched to &s;uccour their engaged Troops, which done, they continued advancing, notwith&s;tand|ing the cries and howlings of the Turks, and their continual Skirmi&s;hing till it was break of day, when a great Mi&s;t covered the whole Field, that nothing could be di&s;cerned. Both &s;ides made u&s;e of this accident, ranging their Armies to their uttermo&s;t Advantage.</P>
<P>After &s;even in the Morning, the Sun having di&s;pell'd the Mi&s;t, the Turks advanced upon the Chri&s;tians, with the noi&s;e of their Drums and horrible Cries, di&s;charging &s;ome Cannon upon their right Wing, charged it with great fury, but they were repul&s;ed; the &s;ame happended on the Mountain where <HI>Tungen</HI> commanded, who was hurt there. At the &s;ame time the Turks attacked with their greate&s;t force, and principal|ly their Foot, the heights on the Chri&s;tians right where Count <HI>Styrum</HI> was, but he was &s;o &s;ea&s;on|ably &s;uccoured by &s;ome Imperial Battalions and other Troops of the &s;econd line, that the Turks were forced to retire, being indeed cha&s;ed and repelled in all the parts of the Army. Being fled by the Mora&s;s, the way they came, they &s;eemed to make head again in their Camp, but upon the advance of the Chri&s;tians, who pa&s;&s;ed the Mora&s;s with their Foot and Hor&s;e, the terror and con&s;ternation was &s;o great among&s;t the Tur|ki&s;h Souldiers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gained by the Chri|&s;tians.</NOTE> that it was impo&s;&s;ible for the Se|ra&s;quier, notwith&s;tanding all his endeavour to per&s;wade his Men to oppo&s;e the pa&s;&s;age of the Mora&s;s. They al&s;o abandoned their Camp, Arms, Cannon, and other In&s;truments of War to the Pur&s;uers, be&s;ides forty En&s;igns and &s;ome two hundred Pri&s;oners which were taken. The Sera&s;quier was hurt in his Leg, and having left five thou&s;and upon the place, &s;ecured the re&s;t by a timely retreat. The two Armies &s;epara|ting after the fight, the Chri&s;tians went back to <HI>Comorra,</HI> in order to their pro&s;ecution of the Siege of <HI>Newheu&s;el:</HI> and the Sera&s;quier having rallied his Forces, and puni&s;hed with &s;trangling &s;ome of his chief Officers, who had not well behaved them&s;elves in the Battel of <HI>Gran,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Danube,</HI> declaring he would relieve <HI>Newheu&s;el</HI> whatever it co&s;t, but &s;oon after he received the news, as the Chri&s;tians had at <HI>Comorra,</HI> that the place was taken by a&s;&s;ault.</P>
<P>The Sera&s;quier however having formed a new train of Artillery of twenty Pieces, which he took out of <HI>Buda,</HI> and being re-inforced with &s;everal fre&s;h Troops, he marched towards <HI>Vac|cia,</HI> incamping betwixt that place and <HI>Pest,</HI> but hearing of the approach of the Chri&s;tian Army, he abandoned <HI>Novigrade</HI> and <HI>Vaccia,</HI> taking the Cannon and Ammunition with him that was there, demoli&s;hing the &s;aid places, and &s;etting fire to them when he left them. He al&s;o ruined the Country about <HI>Pe&s;t,</HI> and having &s;ent a De|tachment to re-inforce the Garri&s;on of <HI>Agria,</HI> he repa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Dunube</HI> with the re&s;t of his Army at <HI>Buda.</HI></P>
<P>And now the Turks do not &s;eem aver&s;e from Peace, the Sera&s;quier having &s;ent an Aga to the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> with a Letter, wherein he ac|quainted his Highne&s;s, that he had full power from the Grand Seignior to treat and conclude a Peace, which he conjures him to promote by offers of great advantage, as abandoning Count <HI>Tekely,</HI> and delivering of the three Ho&s;tages, which were in the Grand Seignior's hands. But the Duke an&s;wered him, that he had no Orders to treat of Peace, and that a Victorious Army was not to be amu&s;ed with &s;uch Propo&s;als, but that he would acquaint his Imperial Maje&s;ty with the Sera&s;quier's de&s;ire.</P>
<P>The Sera&s;quier having pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Danube,</HI> the few Tartars he had, not exceeding &s;ix thou|&s;and, left him and returned home. The Ba&s;&s;a's of <HI>Agria, Temi&s;war</HI> and <HI>Waradin</HI> were &s;ent back, with the Troops under their command, and went home to their re&s;pective Governments, the Sera&s;quier with the re&s;t of his Army po&s;ting him&s;elf betwixt <HI>Buda</HI> and <HI>Alba-Regalis</HI> to ob&s;erve the Chri&s;tians motion.</P>
<P>The Imperial Army had advanced in que&s;t of the Turks as far as <HI>Vaccia,</HI> but hearing that the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Army was &s;eparated in &s;everal Bodies, and marched as above, as al&s;o towards the Frontiers of <HI>Styria</HI> and <HI>Croatia;</HI> the Duke re&s;olved likewi&s;e to &s;end four thou&s;and men to re-inforce Count <HI>Le&s;ley,</HI> and being the Forrage was de&s;troyed, to return, having ordered a De|tachment of five Regiments of Foot, one of Cuira&s;iers, and two of Dragoons and Croats, to march unto uppper <HI>Hungary,</HI> where Count <HI>Caprara</HI> was to command in Chief.</P>
<P>The Sera&s;quier had made &s;everal other At|tempts for Peace, but the Emperour refu&s;ing pa&s;ports to his Aga, tho&s;e overtures vani&s;hed. There had al&s;o been an <HI>Armenian</HI> &s;ent in the be|ginning of this year with overtures of Peace, but he was &s;ent back with this An&s;wer; That the Emperour will not enter into any Negotiation of Peace, but joyntly with the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and Republick of <HI>Venice;</HI> in&s;omuch that finding all his Endeavours for a Treaty fruitle&s;s, he re|pa&s;&s;ed the Bridge of <HI>E&s;&s;eck,</HI> &s;ending part of his
<PB N="315" REF="154">Forces towards <HI>Zigeth,</HI> and the re&s;t towards <HI>Sla|vonia</HI> and <HI>Bo&s;oria,</HI> whereby he al&s;o defeated Count <HI>Le&s;leys</HI> De&s;ign upon <HI>Po&s;&s;ega.</HI></P>
<P>To all the Mi&s;eries of War was added that of the Plague, which raged much at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> which, together with the accompt they had of the lo&s;s of <HI>Newheu&s;el,</HI> and the other ill Succe&s;&s;es of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Army in <HI>Hungary, Morea,</HI> and in|deed every where, had filled not only that Ci|ty, but the Empire with Con&s;ternation and Tu|mult; for the Janizaries, as is u&s;ual in all great Misfortunes, mutined, threathed not only the Grand Vi&s;ier, but the Grand Seignior him&s;elf, and were not to be appea&s;ed without con&s;idera|ble Di&s;tributions among&s;t them; it being al&s;o given out, that his Highne&s;s would him&s;elf com|mand the Army in Per&s;on next Summer.</P>
<P>The Principal Armies of the&s;e potent Adver|&s;aries being in Winter Quarters, we will leave them &s;trugling there to enlarge their Accom|modations, and transfer our Pen to &s;uch Actions as have been remarkable in other Parts.</P>
<P>The Conte&s;ts in upper <HI>Hungary</HI> were various betwixt the Imperiali&s;ts and <HI>Tekelites,</HI> General <HI>Schultz</HI> commanded the former, who had or|der to attack <HI>&V;ngwar,</HI> and afterwards to be&s;iege <HI>E&s;peries</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;&s;aw.</HI> Count <HI>Tekely</HI> thereupon pa&s;&s;es the <HI>Tybi&s;cus,</HI> a&s;&s;embling what Troops he could together, &s;ending to the Neighbour Coun|tries to cau&s;e their Militia to march and to joyn him, which <HI>Schultz</HI> endeavoured to hinder, e&s;|pecially his joyning again&s;t the Turks. And now he lays clo&s;e Siege to <HI>&V;ngwar,</HI> which was defended with no le&s;s Valour than Ob&s;tinacy, in&s;omuch that after the lo&s;s of &s;everal Officers, and a con&s;iderable number of Men, he was ob|liged to rai&s;e the Siege. Some time after he laid &s;iege to the City of <HI>E&s;peries</HI> with eight thou|&s;and men, where he found no le&s;s Oppo&s;ition than at <HI>&V;ngwar,</HI> the be&s;ieged &s;eeming re&s;olved to defend the Place to the la&s;t extremity, not|with&s;tanding the offer made to the Rebels of a general Pardon, which was intimated to the Magi&s;trates and Citizens of <HI>E&s;peries</HI> by an Offi|cer &s;ent from the General, but they, in&s;tead of taking advantage of the Emperour's Clemency, barbarou&s;ly killed the &s;aid Officer, which the General re&s;ented &s;o highly, that he cau&s;ed a general a&s;&s;ault to be given the place, but in vain, being beaten off with the lo&s;s of &s;everal hun|dreds of their Souldiers.

<P>General <HI>Schultz</HI> marched from <HI>E&s;peries</HI> to <HI>Ca&s;|chaw,</HI> and beleagured it, and General <HI>Caprara</HI> to|wards <HI>Tokay,</HI> with a Re&s;olution to take that place what ever it co&s;t, being it opened a pa&s;&s;age betwixt <HI>Tran&s;ilvania</HI> and <HI>Zatmar,</HI> nor did it make any remarkable Oppo&s;ition, but with other le&s;|&s;er Places &s;urrendered without re&s;i&s;tance upon Conditions.</P>

<P>The Grand Seignior had appointed <HI>Solyman</HI> Ba&s;&s;a, now Seraskier, to command his Army again&s;t the <HI>Poles,</HI> which he endeavoured to rai&s;e and form with all imaginable Indu&s;try, being &s;ollicitous for <HI>Caminiec,</HI> which he took care by reiterated Convoys, though &s;ome &s;ometimes mi&s;carried, to provide for.

The Army marched accordingly, and were three days pa&s;&s;ing the Woods and Streights of <HI>Bouco|vi&s;ia</HI> without any Intelligence of the Enemy. Being come into a Plain, their Van-Guard was pre&s;ently charged by a Body of <HI>Tartars.</HI> Ten Troops of Hor&s;e were &s;ent to &s;upport the Chri|&s;tians, but being over-power'd, were forced to give way. The Prince of <HI>Courland</HI> advancing with three Battalions, and &s;ome Field-pieces, gave the Chri&s;tians Opportunity to rally, and returning to the charge, obliged the <HI>Tartars</HI> to retire to the Hill from whence they came.

The <HI>Poles</HI> left Wing was charged by the <HI>Tartars</HI> with &s;ome advantage at fir&s;t, but in the Conclu&s;ion were forced to retire. That day the Turks had been incommoded by the oppo&s;ite Artillery, compo&s;ed of thirty pieces of Ordnance, and the following day, having received Cannon from <HI>Camineck,</HI> they repayed them in kind. The Chri&s;tians continued encamped the two follow|ing days, &s;ecuring them&s;elves with Trenches and Redoubts. On the ninth day, the Chri&s;tian General being informed that a great Detach|ment was &s;ent to fall in the rear of the Army, and &s;hut up the Pa&s;&s;ages of the Forre&s;t, he re|&s;olved to retire; and that he might do it with le&s;s trouble, he cau&s;ed all their Waggons that were not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, to be burnt. It was next Morning before the Turks were aware of their march, when, de&s;cending into the Plain, they charged three Battalions of foot which had not yet entered the Wood, but they being well covered with turn Pikes, and each two Field-pieces, they received the Enemy with &s;o great a Fire, that they forced them to retire. And yet they e&s;caped by their Courage and Re|&s;olution the danger that threatned them, for|cing their Pa&s;&s;age back to the <HI>Nie&s;ter</HI> by a very orderly retreat, which they likewi&s;e pa&s;&s;ed, tho' the Turks were much &s;tronger than they, and &s;o were di&s;per&s;ed into their Winter Quarters.</P>
<P>Nor were the Turks very un&s;uccesful in <HI>Dal|matia.</HI> The Chri&s;tians had be&s;ieged <HI>Singn,</HI> but were forced to retire by the joynt Forces of the Turks in tho&s;e quarters with lo&s;s of &s;ome hun|dreds of their men, two pieces of Cannon, and mo&s;t of their Baggage.

<P>The Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Petra&s;&s;o</HI> marched with eight thou&s;and Men to his relief, but upon con&s;ide|ration of the &s;trength of the Chri&s;tians, he dur&s;t not attempt it; but contenting him&s;elf to re-inforce the Garri&s;on of <HI>Modon,</HI> and with fal|ling upon the <HI>Greeks</HI> (that avoured the <HI>Veneti|ans</HI>) he made a great &s;laughter of them.

Hereupon the Chevalier <HI>de la Tour,</HI> a Knight of <HI>Malta,</HI> ha&s;ten|ing thither with twelve hundred Men, recovered it from the Turks, with the lo&s;s of his own life, and many of his Men. A while after, the <HI>Vi&s;ier</HI> made an attempt upon the main Camp, but was beaten off with mutual lo&s;s. In the mean time, the Chri&s;tian General finding the neighbour|hood of the Turks trouble&s;ome, and fore&s;eeing that his Troops would not be able to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, un|le&s;s they had the Country open, re&s;olved to at|tempt their removal; in order to which, draw|ing ten Men out of a Company, to which were joyned fifteen hundred Voluntiers, with one of the Regiments of <HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> and that of <HI>Malta,</HI> they, marching before day, &s;urpri&s;ed, and fell upon the Enemy on all &s;ides; the action was &s;o &s;udden, that the Turks before they could recol|lect them&s;elves were driven out of their &s;everal Po&s;ts, pur&s;ued, and quite di&s;per&s;ed. Of the E|nemy there were near a thou&s;and killed in the action and pur&s;uit, of which number was the Vi&s;ier <HI>Kalil</HI> and <HI>Mehemet</HI> Ba&s;&s;a. All their Can|non and Baggage were taken, with nine pieces of bra&s;s Cannon, &s;eventeen Colours, and the great Standard, with three Hor&s;e-tayles hanging at it. This Victory was &s;ome days after com|pleted by the taking of <HI>Coron,</HI> where the Chri|&s;tians, forcing the way into the Town, through their very large Breaches,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. <HI>11.</HI></NOTE> put all they met to the Sword. There were above three thou&s;and of the Turks &s;lain in this &s;torm, and four or five hundred of the Chri&s;tians, among which were two Knights of <HI>Malta,</HI> Prince <HI>Phillip</HI> of <HI>Savoy,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Courbon</HI> and St. <HI>Paul,</HI> be&s;ides thirty Knights of <HI>Malta,</HI> with &s;everal other Per&s;ons of Quality wound|ed.

They returned to the charge again, but with the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s, and being pre&s;&s;ed, fell into di&s;order and were defeated; though the lo&s;s was not very great on either &s;ide.

The Grand Seig|nior wondering at what he heard, and that he &s;hould &s;cruple at &s;o eminent a command, de|manded his rea&s;ons: He replied, that the mi&s;|fortunes of the la&s;t Campaign were occa&s;ioned by the ill payment of the Troops, many other things of great importance to his &s;ervice having been likewi&s;e omitted, not ob&s;curely hinting at the Grand Vi&s;ier, he would notwith&s;tanding take the command upon him, if his Maje&s;ty, ac|cording to the example of his Predece&s;&s;ours, would him&s;elf appear at the head of his Forces. The frankne&s;s of this di&s;cour&s;e wrought &s;o much upon the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> that he immedi|ately &s;ent to the <HI>Vi&s;ier,</HI> who was, or pretended to be indi&s;po&s;ed, and con&s;equently kept his bed, to know, whether he was in a condition of health to attend him into <HI>Hungary,</HI> where he purpo&s;ed to go him&s;elf? But the Vi&s;ier excu&s;ing it, by rea&s;on of his indi&s;po&s;ition, his Maje&s;ty &s;ent to him for his Seal, which being delivered, he immediately gave it to <HI>Solyman</HI> Ba&s;&s;a, making him by that eminent mark of dignity Grand <HI>Vi&s;ier</HI> in the others room, who yet had his life granted him, and part of his E&s;tate to &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon, being now in his Hou&s;e on the <HI>Canal</HI> of the black Sea, near <HI>Scutary.</HI></P>
<P>The Trea&s;ure of the <HI>Seraglio</HI> was opened, Officers were &s;ent into all the extent of the Em|pire, and the utmo&s;t diligence was u&s;ed to rai&s;e men, not only to recruit their &s;hattered Armies, but to make new Levies, but with the u&s;ual fate that attends un&s;ucce&s;sful Arms.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chri|&s;tian Army Rendez|vouz's at <HI>Barkam.</HI></NOTE> So that not|with&s;tanding all their endeavours, the Chri&s;ti|ans were in the Field before them, not only with the Imperial Troops, but the united Forces of all the <HI>German</HI> Princes. The general Rendez|vouz was appointed on the <HI>30th</HI> of <HI>May</HI> in the Plains of <HI>Barkam,</HI> though the <HI>Saxons,</HI> the <HI>Bavari|ans,</HI> the <HI>Brandenburgers,</HI> and them of the <HI>Carcles</HI> could not get thither &s;o &s;oon by rea&s;on of their di&s;tant Marches.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>May</HI> 30. 1686.</NOTE> The whole Empire &s;eemed to move, and the <HI>Danube</HI> was &s;o covered with Barks and Barges full of men, provi&s;ions, and all &s;orts of Warlike In&s;truments, that it yielded a pro&s;pect of terror and plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The Forces being come together, the Senti|ments of the General Per&s;ons that compo&s;ed it were very differing. Some propo&s;ed the Siege of <HI>Alba Regalis,</HI> as being a place that had much annoyed them, by protecting the <HI>Seraskier</HI> under the Cannon of the place, when they be&s;ieged <HI>Buda</HI> two years ago. Others would have <HI>Agria</HI> and <HI>Montgatz,</HI> the remains of <HI>Tekely</HI>'s rebellion in Upper <HI>Hungary,</HI> attempted, and the re&s;t were for marching directly to the Bridge of <HI>E&s;&s;eck,</HI> for &s;ecuring that important pa&s;&s;age, and then to be&s;iege <HI>Buda.</HI> Others were of opinion, that the&s;e three de&s;igns &s;hould be enterpri&s;ed at once, by dividing their Army into two parts, for the two fir&s;t Enterpri&s;es, and that General <HI>Schults</HI> &s;hould with the Army of <HI>Croatia</HI> attempt the Bridge of <HI>E&s;&s;eck.</HI> But they were very few that concluded po&s;itively for the Siege of <HI>Buda,</HI> which had already been ab&s;olutely re&s;olved upon by the Emperour and the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> upon a certainty that the taking of that place would va&s;tly inlarge their Quarters, and a &s;uppo&s;ition (though not &s;o well grounded) that all <HI>Hun|gary</HI> would follow the fate of their Capital City.</P>
<P>But this de&s;ign was kept very &s;ecret,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jun. <HI>10.</HI></NOTE> nor was it di&s;covered until the arrival of Count <HI>Straat|man,</HI> Great Chancellor to the Emperour, who having in a Council of War prudently compo|&s;ed the punctilio's and differences between &s;o many General Officers about their commands, to all their &s;atisfactions; he &s;hewed them the Emperour's Commi&s;&s;ion and Orders to begin the Campaign with the Siege of <HI>Buda,</HI> exhort|ing them to do their duty in an enterpri&s;e of &s;uch great importance, whereon depended not only the con&s;ervation of his Highne&s;s's Con|que&s;ts, the &s;ecurity of his Crown, and the good of Chri&s;tendom, but al&s;o the ruine of the <HI>Otto|man</HI> Empire, being the lo&s;s of this con&s;iderable place would be attended on with the &s;urrender
<PB N="319" REF="156">of the other Cities and Fortre&s;&s;es of <HI>Hungary,</HI> which would return to the Obedience of their natural Sovereign.</P>
<P>The Generals, who expected to begin with the Siege of <HI>Agria</HI> or <HI>Alb-Royal,</HI> were overjoy'd to under&s;tand that the de&s;ign was upon <HI>Buda;</HI> and this News being &s;pread among&s;t the Officers and Souldiers of the Armies, they all te&s;tified their Satisfaction by their forwardne&s;s, and their de&s;ire to &s;ee them&s;elves before a Place where they might &s;ignalize their Valour, and revenge the Death of their Comrades, who had been interred in the Trenches of the former Siege.</P>
<P>The Voluntiers, to the number of &s;ix thou|&s;and, of all Quality and Conditions, which were come thither out of <HI>Germany, France, England, Spain,</HI> the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> and other parts of <HI>Eu|rope,</HI> to &s;eek Honour in &s;o pious a War, &s;hewed much Ardour and Zeal to &s;ignalize them&s;elves in &s;o glorious an undertaking. The Troops of the Circles were not yet come, and they of <HI>Bran|denburg,</HI> who marched through <HI>Sile&s;ia,</HI> and the Straits of <HI>Jabluncka,</HI> advanced but &s;lowly by rea|&s;on of the difficulty of their way, and could not come &s;o &s;oon as de&s;ired. But the Armies, to lo&s;e no time, di&s;camped on the twelfth of <HI>June</HI> by break of day, the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> taking his way by the Bridge of <HI>Gran,</HI> had pa&s;&s;ed it the thir|teenth, the Troops of <HI>Saxony</HI> having the Vaunt|guard. The Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> marched on this &s;ide the <HI>Danube</HI> to po&s;&s;e&s;s the City of <HI>Pe&s;t.</HI> Whil&s;t the two Armies were thus marching on both &s;ides the River, Count <HI>Rabatta,</HI> who was Com|mi&s;&s;ary General, had cau&s;ed a prodigious quan|tity of Gabions and Fagots, which the Souldiers had made as they came to the general Randez|vouz, to keep them from Idlene&s;s, to be im|bark'd and &s;ent by Water towards <HI>Buda,</HI> toge|ther with the Artillery, Ammunitions, Provi&s;i|ons, Forrage, and other nece&s;&s;ary things for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of Armies. The next day the Ar|mies advanced, the great one near <HI>Vicegrade,</HI> and the other by <HI>Vaccia.</HI></P>
<P>The fifteenth, the Imperial Hor&s;e, followed by the Foot, and their Cannon and Baggage, pa&s;&s;ed <HI>Vicegrade;</HI> &s;ome Pri&s;oners having been made by a party that the Duke had &s;ent to make Di&s;co|veries. The&s;e unanimou&s;ly declared, that they of <HI>Agria</HI> and <HI>Alba Regalis</HI> fearing a Siege had re|fuged all their be&s;t Moveables in <HI>Buda,</HI> and that this Capital City was, as well as the other Places, furni&s;hed with Troops and nece&s;&s;ary Provi&s;i|ons to &s;u&s;tain a long Siege, in expectation of Re|lief.</P>
<P>Being come within an hour of the Town without any encounter, the Hor&s;e made halt, as well to repo&s;e them&s;elves, as to expect the com|ing up of their Infantry and Artillery, and now they begin to lay a Bridge of Boats at the I&s;le of St. <HI>Andrew</HI> for the Communication of the two &s;ides of the <HI>Danube.</HI></P>
<P>On the eighteenth, the Baron of <HI>Diependal,</HI> General <HI>de Battalia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Siege of <HI>Buda.</HI></NOTE> inve&s;ted the City of <HI>Buda,</HI> whil&s;t the Infantry were marching up, and ta|king up their Po&s;ts half a League from the place, they began to break Ground, and work at their Line of Circumvallation. A great party of Hor&s;e and Foot appeared out of the Garri&s;on at the <HI>Vienna</HI> Port, but they returned again upon the advance of a Detachment of Imperial Hor&s;e, who had Orders to charge them, contented to welcome the A&s;&s;ailants with eight Volleys from their Cannon, though they kill'd but one Pio|neer, by rea&s;on of the too great di&s;tance.</P>
<P>The nineteenth, the Duke advanced with the Army as far as the hot Baths, the Turks having abandoned that Po&s;t the day before. The ge|neral Quarters were taken up within a quarter of a League of the Town. The &s;ame day the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> &s;eized upon the City of <HI>Pe&s;t,</HI> which the Turks had quitted, retiring with their Cannon, Ammunitions and Provi&s;ions into <HI>Bu|da,</HI> after they had broken part of the Bridge be|hind them. The <HI>Croats,</HI> who &s;couted about the Country, took a Turki&s;h <HI>Chiaux,</HI> with a Con|voy of forty <HI>Spahis,</HI> who was &s;ent with Letters from the Port to the Vi&s;ier of <HI>Buda.</HI> Being brought to the Camp, his Letters were examined, which contained rigorous Orders to the Vi&s;ier, to be very careful of the Places which depended on his Government, and to a&s;&s;ure him of a quick and powerful relief in ca&s;e he were at|tack'd.</P>
<P>On the twentieth, the Bridge over the <HI>Danube</HI> was fini&s;hed. The &s;ame day a party of Hor&s;e &s;allied out of the Town with de&s;ign to &s;urpri&s;e the Chri&s;tians advanced Guard, but the Duke being adverti&s;ed of it in time, &s;ent four &s;qua|drons, to which many Volunteers joyned them|&s;elves, with orders to charge them; but they up|on their approach retired without any engaging. The Artillery being arrived, two Batteries were rai&s;ed again&s;t the lower Town, where the Duke of <HI>Lorrains</HI> Attack was, and at Night the Tren|ches were opened. A Janizary who de&s;erted, reported much after the &s;ame manner that the Pri&s;oners already mentioned had done; that there were but eight thou&s;and men of formed Troops in the Town. The Vi&s;ier having &s;ome time before &s;ent two thou&s;and Souldiers to <HI>Agria,</HI> and as many to <HI>Alba-Regalis,</HI> upon a &s;uppo&s;ition that the Chri&s;tians would not think of be&s;ieging <HI>Buda,</HI> which had been &s;o fatal to them but two years ago. This Run-away affirmed further, that the Place was abundantly furni&s;hed with all manner of Provi&s;ions and Ammunitions to &s;u|&s;tain a very long Siege, that the Vi&s;ier <HI>Abdi</HI> Ba&s;&s;a was no great Warrior, and therefore the le&s;s con&s;idered by the Souldiery; that he had a&s;&s;embled all the Officers and Souldiers of the Garri&s;on together, had exhorted them to do their Duty, and to &s;upport with Honour the Glory of the Turbant, adding, that he had Or|ders from the Grand Seignior to defend the Ci|ty with his Life, which he was re&s;olved to do, and expect the Succours which the Grand Vi&s;ier would infallibly bring them. To this the <HI>Ja|nizaries</HI> and <HI>Spahis</HI> replyed, that they were ready to &s;acrifice their. Lives in his Highne&s;s's Service, and for defence of their Laws, upon Condition however, that the Vi&s;ier would immediately give them ten Crowns a Man, that the Souldi|ers and Officers that were detained in Pri&s;on for what Crime &s;oever &s;hould be &s;et at Liberty, and that he would not &s;uffer things to come to the la&s;t extremity, le&s;t the &s;ame misfortune might happen to them, as did to tho&s;e of <HI>Newheu&s;el,</HI> all which the Vi&s;ier promi&s;ed them to ob&s;erve ex|actly.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t acknowledge I am entring into a te|dious Narrative, and &s;omewhat again&s;t my Hu|mour, which affects lucid brevity; but the Hi|&s;tory of this Siege, perhaps circum&s;tantially the greate&s;t upon Record, full of &s;uch &s;trange Events; of Emulation in the pur&s;uit of Glory; of &s;ucce&s;|ful Temerity, and an invincible Re&s;olution on the one &s;ide; as al&s;o the Fidelity, the Con&s;tan|cy, and the unfortunate Valour of the other, hurries me on to a de&s;cription of it in all its par|ticulars, which I will do with that Candor, that the very indifferent Reader &s;hall find nothing that may ju&s;tly &s;hock him, and the curious wherewith to content him.</P>
<PB N="320" REF="157">
<P>The Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> having left a Garri|&s;on at <HI>Pe&s;t,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ed the Bridge of Boats at the I&s;le of St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> came with his Army be|fore the place, and took his Po&s;t in the &s;ame place where he had commanded in the prece|ding Siege, that is, on the Ca&s;tle &s;ide, and the upper Town, to form the &s;econd attack, the third being re&s;erved for the <HI>Brandenburgers,</HI> who were expected in a few days, and were to be re|inforced with the Troops of <HI>Suabia</HI> and <HI>Franco|nia.</HI> That Night the Turks fired mightily up|on them that worked in the Approaches and Batteries, whereof &s;everal were killed and hurt in the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack.</P>
<P>The Duke &s;ent all the Imperial and <HI>Bavarian</HI> Hor&s;e, under the command of the Generals <HI>Palfi, Gondola,</HI> and others, to camp in the Neigh|bourhood of <HI>Alba Regalis,</HI> on purpo&s;e to con|&s;ume the Forrage, and keep that Garri&s;on in continual alarms, there remaining in the Camp but three thou&s;and Imperial and fifteen hundred <HI>Bavarian</HI> Hor&s;e to &s;ecure the Trenches and Pio|neers. The Night pa&s;&s;ed, the Battery again&s;t the lower Town was brought to perfection, and twelve Pieces of Cannon mounted upon it, which played all the following day with the lo&s;s of five men &s;lain, and &s;everal wounded, from break of day the Cannon continued firing with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that they made a breach in the Wall of the lower Town, which was found to be twenty paces large. In the mean time the <HI>Bavarians</HI> on their &s;ide carried their Approaches on with great diligence, and had al&s;o &s;ome killed and wounded.</P>
<P>The day following, the breach being enlarged, was a&s;&s;aulted towards evening, the Walls being ea&s;ily gained, for the Defendants retired into the upper Town after the fir&s;t di&s;charge. The Chri|&s;tians lo&s;t a Captain of Foot, a Lieutenant of Granadiers, &s;ome Souldiers, and &s;ix Voluntiers in this attempt, be&s;ides &s;even or eight hurt; and from that time they began to attack the Town in form, it being re&s;olved that the Trenches &s;hould be relieved every day by a Lieutenant General, and a Major General, as well in the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI>'s attack, as in the Elector's. The <HI>25th</HI> Count <HI>Souches</HI> and <HI>Diependal</HI> relieved the Trenches, but nothing was done be&s;ides a&s;|&s;uring the Lodgment upon the Wall of the lower Town, and opening the Gate which the Turks had &s;hut up on the right, far enough from the breach where they took Po&s;t, and that the Labourers might be le&s;s incommoded, Ge|neral <HI>Souches</HI> cau&s;ed fire to be put in the neigh|bouring Hou&s;es, where &s;ome Fu&s;eliers did lurk, who were burnt with them. The <HI>Bavarians</HI> fi|ni&s;hed the &s;ame day a little Battery upon St. <HI>Ge|rards</HI> Hill, which the Turks had abandoned, from whence they threw &s;ome &s;mall Bombs in|to the City to try experiments. They al&s;o fi|ni&s;hed another great Battery to beat the great Rondel which joyns the Ca&s;tle to the upper Town. The &s;ame day Count <HI>Budiani</HI> pre&s;ented &s;ome Standards to the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> taken from a party of Turki&s;h Hor&s;e, which convoy|ed fourteen or fifteen Barks loaden with the Wives and Children of the Officers of <HI>Buda,</HI> who retired with all their riches to <HI>Belgrade,</HI> and which his <HI>Heyduques</HI> and <HI>Hu&s;&s;ars,</HI> reinforced with &s;ome Imperial Dragoons, had &s;urpri&s;ed and bea|ten at the I&s;land of St. <HI>Margaret.</HI> The booty was great, and ninety-two Women and Chil|dren taken, among&s;t which was the <HI>Vi&s;ier</HI> of <HI>Buda</HI>'s Wife.</P>
<P>The <HI>26th,</HI> they made &s;everal traver&s;e Lines, and laboured to compleat the Approaches to &s;e|cure their Quarters in the lower Town, which was furni&s;hed with two thou&s;and Souldiers, and a good number of Pioneers. The Earth being rude and &s;tony, did much ob&s;truct the Labour|ers. The great Ma&s;ter of the Teutonick Order, which commanded the Trenches, ob&s;erving that the Pioneers in the lower Town might be ea|&s;ily in&s;ulted and beaten by the Be&s;ieged, had up|on his demand &s;ix Battalions &s;ent him, which were po&s;ted along the Wall to countenance them. Two fugitives, who &s;aid they were <HI>Hun|garians,</HI> rendered them&s;elves, and confirmed that the Garri&s;on was but eight thou&s;and Comba|tants, who by order of the Vi&s;ier had begun to untile the Hou&s;es, and unpave the Streets, to hinder the effect of the Bombs. In the evening betwixt &s;ix and &s;even a Clock, the Turks fallied out with great Cries, to intimidate them who were po&s;ted in the Rondel by the Water &s;ide, but they were &s;o well received, that they re|treated confu&s;edly. Mar&s;hal <HI>Starenberg</HI> ha&s;tned thither &s;ea&s;onably with two Battalions of them that had been po&s;ted the day before behind the Wall, without which Succour the Turks would have made a great Slaughter among&s;t the La|bourers. The Enemy was pur&s;ued, and the Souldiers cut off &s;ome Heads, which they pre|&s;ented to the Duke, who gave them a golden Ducket for each Head. A Captain was hurt in this &s;cuffle, and ten or twelve Souldiers killed, and as many wounded.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bavarians</HI> rai&s;ed two Batteries for Bombs on the two &s;ides of their great Battery. They carried on their Trench above one hundred pa|ces, and ran three traver&s;e Lines, with a place of Arms for the defence of their Battery. The Turks fired much with their Artillery, but kil|led only two Souldiers.</P>
<P>The <HI>27th,</HI> the Chri&s;tians compleated the works they had made in the Night, new tra|ver&s;es were made, &s;ome Musketiers were placed in the Mo&s;que of the old Town, a Po&s;t was ta|ken on the right near the Gate which makes the Angle of the Upper Town, the Lines were en|larged, and deepned, and the great Battery was well-nigh fini&s;hed, with the lo&s;s only of one Man, and &s;ome few wounded. This Morning the Enemy appear'd where they had been ye&s;terday, &s;eemingly di&s;po&s;ed to skirmi&s;h, but &s;eeing that the Chri&s;tians were ready to receive them, they retired without attempting any thing. About Eleven a Clock they &s;allied out, Hor&s;e and Foot, with de&s;ign to di&s;lodge the Be|&s;iegers po&s;ted on the right, but having &s;tood a Volley, and &s;eeing Count <HI>Hoffkirchen,</HI> Lieutenant Collonel to <HI>Dunewald,</HI> advancing with the Guards of Hor&s;e, they returned into the City, leaving twenty of their men dead behind them. Of the Chri&s;tians there were but two killed, and five or &s;ix hurt. Another De&s;erter came out of Town, who reported, that the Governour was greatly perplexed, in that he &s;aw the inevitable fall of the City, which the Grand Seignior had committed to his charge, and that he lo&s;t in the Sallies his be&s;t Souldiers, without being able to ruine the Enemies works; but that he re&s;ented nothing equally with the captivity of his Wife, and tho&s;e of the Principal Officers of the Place, taken when they thought them pa&s;t danger. In the <HI>Bavarian</HI> attack they fini&s;hed a battery to play upon the Ca&s;tle, and the Rondel that joyns it to the City.</P>
<P>The <HI>28th,</HI> in the <HI>Lorrain</HI> attack, a Line of Communication four hundred paces long was drawn from the Po&s;t at the Angle on the right to the middle Gate, and another Line was made to go to the new battery, upon which they plan|ted twelve pieces of Cannon. A little one was
<PB N="321" REF="157">likewi&s;e in hand for four Mortars which were carried thither that Night, with &s;ome Cart loads of Bombs. The be&s;ieged began to &s;hoot Bombs and Stones out of Town. A Captain and &s;ix|teen Souldiers were wounded that Night, and &s;ome killed. The Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> fore&s;eeing that Forrage would grow &s;carce in the Camp, &s;ent mo&s;t of the baggage Hor&s;es to the Meadows a&s;&s;igned them betwixt <HI>Gran</HI> and <HI>Newheu&s;el.</HI> Ge|neral <HI>Dunewald,</HI> who commanded the Hor&s;e, camped near <HI>Alb-Royal,</HI> adverti&s;ed the Duke, that the Turks having abandoned the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Bathyan</HI> upon the River of <HI>Zarvis,</HI> he had put men into it, and that he was going to make a tentative upon <HI>Palotta,</HI> a place of good &s;trength near <HI>Alb-Royal.</HI></P>
<P>The twenty ninth, they continued to compleat their Works, and the Duke augmented the number of the Labourers with an addition of &s;ix hundred more. The be&s;ieged made no Sal|lies the&s;e two days, but they plyed their Artil|lery more furiou&s;ly than ordinary to ruine the Chri&s;tians great Battery. About five a Clock they &s;allied upon the <HI>Bavarian</HI> attack, with two thou&s;and Hor&s;e and Foot, with &s;o much Succe&s;s, that they put the Be&s;iegers into much di&s;order, and the Janizaries leaping into the Approaches, were bu&s;ie in throwing of them down, when Count <HI>Hoffkirch</HI> flying thither with the Guard of Hor&s;e from the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI>'s Quarter, and the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Generals with their re&s;erves, the fight was rude on both &s;ides, till the Turks were forced to retreat, being pur&s;ued even to the Gates of their City, notwith&s;tanding the conti|nued fire from their Cannon and Mu&s;quets from the Walls. Prince <HI>Eugenius</HI> of <HI>Savoy</HI> had his Hor&s;e killed under him. Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Baden,</HI> and the Generals <HI>Fontaine</HI> and <HI>la Vargne</HI> &s;ignalized them&s;elves in this Action, as al&s;o the Voluntiers, and particularly the Prince of <HI>Commercy. Switter|dael,</HI> a <HI>Bavarian</HI> Lieutenant-Collonel was &s;lain, as al&s;o &s;ix Voluntiers, with thirty &s;even Soul|diers, be&s;ides &s;ixty two wounded, one Cap|tain, two Lieutenants, and an En&s;ign. The lo&s;s on the Turks &s;ide was greater, being the Chri&s;tians brought away &s;ixty of their Heads, be&s;ides what a fugitive <HI>Ra&s;cian</HI> reported, that the Turks had had near two hundred kill'd and wounded. That Evening the four Mortars pla|ced by the great Battery began to play into the be&s;ieged Works. Six Culverins were al&s;o plant|ed upon the old Battery, wherewith they de&s;ign'd to &s;hoot into the Town Gate, to incommode the Sallies of the be&s;ieged.</P>
<P>The thirtieth, the Troops of <HI>Suabia</HI> and <HI>Fran|conia</HI> arrived in the Camp, and took the Po&s;ts de&s;igned for them; all the Night and Day were employed to advance the Works, which are &s;o numerous, that they are &s;carce di&s;tingui&s;hable. Count <HI>Souches,</HI> who commanded the Trenches that day, having &s;ent three Granadeers to di&s;|cover the di&s;tance betwixt the Approaches and the Rondel, they brought word that it was no more than three hundred paces, and that the Turks were making a Ditch at the foot of the &s;aid Rondel. Every Night great &s;tore of Gabi|ons, Fagots, Munitions, and Provi&s;ions, arrived in the Camp, by the care of the Commi&s;&s;ary General, Count <HI>Rabatta.</HI> Count <HI>Caprara</HI> parted from the Camp with the <HI>Suabian</HI> Hor&s;e, to joyn tho&s;e encamped near <HI>Alb-Royal,</HI> and to com|mand the whole in chief. Five <HI>Ra&s;cian</HI> Shep|heards, feeding their Sheep without under the Walls, &s;lipt in&s;en&s;ibly into the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Quar|ters with at lea&s;t four hundred, where they were well received and gratified. All they could &s;ay was, that the Con&s;ternation was great among&s;t the be&s;ieged, who were yet re&s;olved to defend them&s;elves, in expectation of the Succours they were in hope for. They added, that the Bombs and Carca&s;&s;es had fired the Town in &s;everal Places, though it had been luckily enough ex|tingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of <HI>July,</HI> Count <HI>Starenberg</HI> &s;hewed General <HI>Schoning,</HI> who commanded the <HI>Braden|burg</HI> Auxiliaries, and arrived in the Camp the Night before, the Approaches and the Attacks which were re&s;erved for his Troops, which was on the Water &s;ide on the left of the Imperiali&s;ts, after which he was magnificently treated by the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> from whence he went to joyn his Troops which were expected the next, or the following day. This Morning the Imperiali&s;ts began to &s;hoot out of their new Battery, out of four Pieces which &s;hot twenty four pound Bul|lets. The five Mortars by the great Battery continued to play upon the Rondel on the right, with &s;uch Succe&s;s that the Defendants dur&s;t not &s;hew them&s;elves there. The Works were com|pleating, and there were two Redoubts made to &s;ecure the Communication with the great Bat|tery. This Night there were but five hurt, and one killed, and this Morning an Adjoutant Ge|neral was hurt in the Head with a Mu&s;quet-&s;hot, as he was carrying Orders into the Approaches. There hapned nothing in the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Quarters, where they only continued their Labour and their Batteries, made a Breach in the outward Rampart. The re&s;t of the Troops of <HI>Franconia,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting in fourteen hundred Foot, arrived there, who were placed near the re&s;t of the &s;ame Circle.</P>
<P>The &s;econd, the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack advanced within two hundred Paces of the Walls of the City. The battery of twelve Guns of twenty four pound Balls was fini&s;hed, and four other Mortars that played without cea&s;ing all the la&s;t Night, fired the Town near the great Church, which la&s;ted till Morning; the Cannon was plyed all this day again&s;t the two fir&s;t Rondels, which are in a manner defencele&s;s. Two Bat|talions more were &s;ent to reinforce tho&s;e who were camped under the Wall of the old Town. The be&s;ieged threw again many Bombs and Stones, but with little prejudice to the Be&s;iegers, killing them not above three or four Souldiers. The Troops of <HI>Suaben</HI> began to work at their line of Circumvallation, and purpos'd the follow|ing Night to rai&s;e a Battery upon a height which they po&s;&s;e&s;s'd. The <HI>Bavarians</HI> thundred furiou&s;ly again&s;t the Ca&s;tle and upper Town, and had thrown many Bombs which had kindled a fire that was not yet extingui&s;hed. The Duke ap|prehending that the Turks might when it was dark, put, by the help of &s;mall barks, Men, and Ammunition into the Town, went in Per&s;on to di&s;cover the &s;u&s;pected Places about <HI>Pe&s;t,</HI> com|manding the Prince of <HI>Savoys</HI> Regiment of Dra|goons to po&s;t them&s;elves there, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the <HI>Hun|garians</HI> who were already there, and had Orders to rai&s;e &s;ome Sconces along the River &s;ide for their Security.</P>
<P>On the third of <HI>July,</HI> the <HI>Brandenburg</HI> Troops were &s;een to march on the other &s;ide of the <HI>Da|nube.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> went to vi&s;it them, where he was received by General <HI>Schoning</HI> with a triple <HI>Salvo</HI> of all the Foot, ranged in battalia, with their Cannon at the head of the Infantry. His Highne&s;s was treated there with much Gal|lantry, and afterwards returned to his Quarters extremely &s;atisfied to &s;ee &s;uch a fine body of Men, &s;o brisk, &s;o well di&s;ciplin'd, and provided with &s;uch a good Train of Artillery. The Im|periali&s;ts fini&s;hed another line for to defend their
<PB N="322" REF="158">Approaches. They made &s;uch great fire with their Cannon and Mortars, that they did not only make a notable breach in the Wall, but ruined al&s;o the batteries upon the two fir&s;t Ron|dels, &s;o that there was no more &s;hooting thence. The <HI>Bavarians</HI> carried their lines to the very Ca&s;tle, and made a new battery on the right towards the <HI>Danube,</HI> upon which they placed nine Mortars with &s;ucce&s;s. They &s;hot al&s;o three days together from another battery of &s;even Demy-Cannon upon the Rondel; whil&s;t they play'd from another with four Guns upon the Flanks. They moreover worked at another of eight Cannon to batter the left of the Ron|del. In the <HI>Lorrain</HI> attack there were &s;even &s;lain, and &s;everal hurt. Among&s;t the re&s;t of the De|&s;erters, there was an En&s;ign of the Janizaries, who quitted the Town for having (as he &s;aid) killed a Turki&s;h Officer. He affirmed that there was but fifteen hundred real Janizaries in the place, but that counting the <HI>Spahi</HI>'s, Albamans, and other Troops, they amounted to &s;even thou&s;and Combatants; He added, that the Bombs and Carka&s;&s;es had already ruined many buildings, and occa&s;ioned a great lo&s;s of Men and Cattel. He further &s;aid, that the be&s;ieged were bu&s;ie in making Mines behind the breach on the <HI>Lorrain</HI> &s;ide, and that no body had hi|therto entered into the place. General <HI>Dunewald</HI> had de&s;i&s;ted from his de&s;ign upon <HI>Pallotta,</HI> be|cau&s;e the place was provided with a good Ga|ri&s;on. The Turks there killed &s;ome of tho&s;e who were &s;ent to di&s;cover. Tho&s;e of <HI>Alb-Royal</HI> attacked and di&s;ordered al&s;o &s;ome Foragers of Hor&s;e quartered in their Neighbourhood, and among&s;t others killed Count <HI>Papenheim,</HI> a Cap|tain of Hor&s;e in the Troops of <HI>Bavaria.</HI></P>
<P><HI>July 4th,</HI> The Approaches of the <HI>Lorrain</HI> attack were run within one hundred paces of the breach in the Rondel to the right. The be&s;ieged be|gan to run a Line out of the &s;aid breach, which they lengthned till within fifty paces of the Chri|&s;tians, to render their approach more difficult; and however, they fired continually with their &s;mall &s;hot, and threw a multitude of &s;tones, yet they killed and wounded but thirteen men. The be&s;iegers had now fourteen Mortars mounted, out of which they perpetually to&s;&s;ed Bombs and Carka&s;&s;es. There was nothing done at the <HI>Bavarian</HI> attack, but &s;ecuring the works, and heightning the batteries. A <HI>Pole,</HI> who had &s;er|ved among&s;t the <HI>Turks,</HI> came over this morn|ing, and reported that the be&s;ieged were re&s;ol|ved to &s;urrender, if they were not relieved in a Months time. Another Run-away came this Afternoon, and declared, that five Turki&s;h Ca|valiers were by the means of a little Bark land|ed on <HI>Pe&s;t</HI> &s;ide, who were by &s;everal ways to endeavour to arrive where the <HI>Seraskier</HI> was, and pre&s;s the Succours which had been promi|&s;ed them. The Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> di&s;patched &s;ome Hor&s;e towards <HI>Voitfar</HI> to con&s;ume the Forage there, and watch the Enemies motion. A party of <HI>Tartars</HI> fell upon the Foragers on the other &s;ide the <HI>Danube,</HI> and took &s;ome Hor&s;es, and two Grooms belonging to the Prince of <HI>Baden,</HI> out of the I&s;land of St. <HI>Margaret:</HI> the following Night, &s;ixty Granadiers with &s;ome Workmen were &s;ent to ruine the Line which the be&s;ieged had begun before the breach of the Rondel, which luck'd &s;o well, that they filled the Ditch with the lo&s;s of two Soldiers only. The breach|es were every day enlarged, as well on the <HI>Lor|rain</HI> as the <HI>Bavier</HI> attack, and what the <HI>Turks</HI> re|paired in the night, was thrown down by day. All the Troops of <HI>Brandenburg</HI> are at pre&s;ent ar|rived in their Quarters. The <HI>Turks</HI> made a &s;ally upon them in the Night, who, though they were well received, and pur&s;ued even to the Town Gate, yet they killed many brave men of the be&s;ieged, and among&s;t the re&s;t Field-Mar&s;hal General <HI>Dorfeling</HI>'s Son, two Lieutenants, and twenty-&s;even Souldiers, with the like number wounded.</P>
<P><HI>Jul.</HI> 6. A line of communication was made from the <HI>Lorrain</HI> attack to that of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> which is but fifty paces from the Rondel of the middle Gate, and about &s;ixty from the breach on the right. This morning they &s;hot the Can|non with that fury, that they quite threw down the two Rondels, and the Curtain, and at night throwing Bombs and Carka&s;&s;es without cea&s;ing, they cau&s;ed a fire to burn on the right of the Rondel, that could not be quenched in le&s;s than three hours time. The <HI>Brandenburgers</HI> advanced their works briskly, their Generals of Battalia's keeping alternatively in the Trenches. They had eight &s;lain and &s;ix wounded, be&s;ides a Cap|tain of Granadeers, Lieutenant Collonel <HI>Fonk</HI> was al&s;o hurt in the Legg, and &s;ix more of the <HI>Lor|rain</HI> attack, be&s;ides two killed.</P>
<P><HI>Jul.</HI> 7. The Night preceding, very many Bombs were thrown with &s;ucce&s;s, being they fi|red the Town in two places, but upon the arri|val of the Engeneer <HI>Gonzales,</HI> it was pre&s;umed the Town would be thundred with greater violence, he is expected in two or three days in the Camp, where the Cannon, Mortars, Bombs, Carka&s;&s;es, and other artificial fire-works of his invention are already arrived: The be&s;ieged made this morning a &s;alley upon the <HI>Brandenburgers</HI> with Hor&s;e and Foot, but to their prejudice, being beaten back with di&s;order. Ye&s;terday the Mi|ners began to work in the <HI>Lorrain</HI> attack to wi|den the breaches, and this Night the &s;ame will be done in that of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> where they have fi|ni&s;hed two new Batteries, one of ten, and the other of &s;even Cannons, be&s;ides a third on the Water &s;ide, to better the attack'd Rondel, and a Po&s;t by which the be&s;ieged u&s;ed to creep out into a covered way which they had made be|fore the Rondel. Ye&s;terday the <HI>Bavarians</HI> had carried their approaches to the very foot of the Ca&s;tle, &s;o that they could come no nearer be|fore the breach was enlarged. The works in the <HI>Lorrain</HI> attack were &s;o near the Wall, that they could advance no further, but by lodging in the breach. There were about fifty killed and hurt in the three attacks. The be&s;ieged &s;hot a Bomb, which falling upon one of the out-Batteries into a Barrel of Powder, killed nine Cannoneers that attended there.</P>
<P>The <HI>8th,</HI> Two new Batteries, each of three Demy-Cannon, were rai&s;ed in the <HI>Lorrain</HI> attack nearer the Walls, and on the left, where they were equally advanced with the right, the ap|proaches were advanced to the Wall of the Rondel; and as the&s;e Works were &s;o near, there were twenty-five hurt and wounded, mo&s;t with Stones and Granadoes, among&s;t whom Major General <HI>Thungen</HI> was one, Major <HI>Bi&s;|chos&s;hau&s;en</HI> had his Arm broke with a Mu&s;quet, and &s;ome other Officers wounded. The Miners which were attack'd to the right of the Rondel, had not yet encountered the Enemies Mines. At night they will plant others to the left of the middle Rondel. Some Pea&s;ants having found means to e&s;cape out of Town, came to the Camp, affirming, that there were &s;till above three hundred men which worked continually at the Mines and Retrenchments which the be|&s;ieged made behind their Walls, for their re|treat in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<PB N="323" REF="158">
<P><HI>July</HI> the ninth, the whole Night was &s;pent in &s;hooting of Bombs and Carca&s;&s;es into the City, to keep the be&s;ieged in Action, and take away their de&s;ire of repo&s;e, but the&s;e perceiving at break of day that the Enemy had made a Gallery of Planks to pa&s;s the Miners to the middle Ron|del, they rolled down many Bombs, threw many Granados, and other artificial Fire, with combu&s;tible &s;tuff in &s;uch abundance, that the Planks were burnt, and the Gallery reduced to A&s;hes. At five in the Morning the be&s;ieged &s;prung a Mine &s;ome Paces from the Wall, be|twixt the middle Rondel, and that at the Gate with Succe&s;s, being it overturned one of the Chri&s;tians Mines, with the lo&s;s of &s;even or eight of the Miners. They &s;econded this with a &s;harp Sally, di&s;ordered the Workmen, ruined their Labours, and po&s;ted them&s;elves betwixt the <HI>Im|periali&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Brandenburgers,</HI> but the re&s;erve coming to their Aid from their place of Arms, they forced them back into the Town. There were above eighty of the two Attacks killed and wounded in this Adventure, one of their chief Cannoneers &s;lain, and &s;everal &s;ubaltern Officers. The be&s;ieged lo&s;t as many; Notwith|&s;tanding this check, the Works were continued with the &s;ame Vigour in the Approaches, Lines, and Galleries. On the <HI>Bavarian</HI> &s;ide they ruin|ed the little Port from their Battery with ten demy Cannons, and the breach there was very &s;pacious.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> the tenth, At the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack they work'd all Night to repair the Batteries and the Approaches which the be&s;ieged had ruined in the former Sally, and to redre&s;s the Gallery which they had burnt, and the Miners were again fired that Night. At the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Attack the Miners worked under the Palizade of the Rondel, and under the Wall, with hopes of compleating their Mines in three days; &s;everal were &s;lain, among&s;t whom was Lieutenent-Col|lonel <HI>Wachtenheim.</HI> The Chri&s;tians had Intelli|gence by their Spies, that the Turks, to the num|ber of &s;even thou&s;and, reinforced with &s;ome <HI>Tartars</HI> who ravaged the Country, had a de&s;ign to introduce a new Commander, with a recruit of Troops into <HI>Buda,</HI> which obliged the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> to command &s;ome Foot to po&s;t them|&s;elves on the other &s;ide of the <HI>Danube,</HI> and upon occa&s;ion to joyn with the Hor&s;e that were there already, and meet and fight the Enemies.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> the eleventh, This evening five demy Cannons were mounted on the two new Batteries in the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack, and two Mortars planted in a little Fort, with the lo&s;s only of two killed, and five hurt. The <HI>Brandenburgers</HI> placed three pieces in battery, and would plant more the Night following to &s;hoot glowing Bullets into the City. The <HI>Bavarians</HI> fortified their Attack by two Re|doubts. Ye&s;terday in the Evening four hun|dred Foot were ordered to rai&s;e &s;ome Defences on <HI>Pe&s;t</HI> &s;ide near the <HI>Danube,</HI> to hinder le&s;t any thing &s;hould pa&s;s that way into <HI>Buda.</HI></P>
<P><HI>July</HI> the twelfth, All the Batteries of <HI>Lorrain</HI> and <HI>Brandenburg</HI> were compleated, and the fir&s;t lines of the&s;e two Attacks were &s;o joyned, that men could pa&s;s from the one to the other un|di&s;covered, by the Enemies Fire. And now they were &s;o near the Walls, the be&s;ieged did perpe|tually throw hand Granadoes and Stones to in|commode the Workmen, but without any great harm. The Miner on the left found him|&s;elf much advanced under the Wall, but they met with more difficulty on the right, and &s;o they would inlarge the breach by force of their Cannon. The Count <HI>de Souches</HI> in&s;pected the breach by order of the Field Mar&s;hal <HI>Starenberg,</HI> and it was found &s;pacious enough to be a&s;&s;aulted: The <HI>Brandenburgers</HI> began to &s;hoot their infla|med Bullets and Bombs out of twenty two Can|nons, and two Mortars, but with no great Suc|ce&s;s, being the Be&s;ieged had uncovered all their Hou&s;es. The Bombs and Carca&s;&s;es invented by the <HI>Franci&s;can</HI> Frier were highly e&s;teemed. They now only plained and inlarged the Breaches, and prepared them&s;elves for the a&s;&s;ault. There were nine hurt and three &s;lain with Granadoes and Stones. The Breach in the great Rondel on the <HI>Bavarian</HI> &s;ide was large enough, and the Miner was at work under the Pallizade of the Ditch. The Duke having Intelligence that the Seraskier was advanced with &s;ome thou&s;ands of Turks near <HI>Hatwan,</HI> commanded 3000 Hor&s;e, and &s;ix Battalions of Foot, <HI>Imperiali&s;ts, Branden|burgers,</HI> and <HI>Bavarians,</HI> under the Conduct of Ge|neral <HI>Mercy,</HI> to pa&s;s the <HI>Danube,</HI> and po&s;t them|&s;elves on the other &s;ide of the Bridge, to hinder the Turks to put a recruit of Troops into the Ci|ty, with the new de&s;igned Commander, <HI>Achmet</HI> Ba&s;&s;a, who had the Reputation of being one of the be&s;t Officers that the Grand Seignior had in his Service.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> the thirteenth, This morning the be&s;ie|ged &s;prung a Mine under the middle Rondel near the Chri&s;tians Mine, which was already fini&s;hed, which Mine did what the be&s;iegers de|&s;igned, by throwing down part of the Rondel, where they had no breach as yet. There were two hundred Turks ready to fly into the adver&s;e Works as &s;oon as the Mine took, but &s;eeing it had a contrary effect to what they de&s;igned, they retired. All things being di&s;po&s;ed for an a&s;&s;ault, thereby to make a lodgment upon the Wall, Count <HI>Starenburg</HI> directed the attack in the manner following. Count <HI>Guydo Starenburg</HI> commanded on the right of the Rondel, Count <HI>Herber&s;tein</HI> the middle of the Curtain, and Count <HI>Aversberg,</HI> all three field Officers, on the left. They had each of them two hundred and eighty Soul|diers; the Engineers, Granadeers, Fu&s;eliers, Car|penters, and Pioneers, were po&s;ted betwixt two, and the re&s;t, to the number of two thou&s;and, were divided into three bodies of Re&s;erves to &s;upport the A&s;&s;ailants: the Voluntiers who had demanded the point, mingled them&s;elves with the fir&s;t. Betwixt &s;even and eight a Clock the &s;ignal for the A&s;&s;ault was given, by a di&s;charge from all the Batteries, and a &s;hower of Bombs and Carca&s;&s;es which were di&s;charged upon the City, and the Retrenchments which the be&s;ieged had made behind the breach; and notwith&s;tanding all the re&s;i&s;tance of the be&s;ieged, the Chri&s;tians mounted the breach, where the Combat was very rude and ob&s;tinate on both &s;ides for three quarters of an hour, with all po&s;&s;ible bravery. The be&s;ieged &s;prung a Mine under the A&s;&s;ai|lants fir&s;t line, which buried Captain <HI>Kalkreiter,</HI> and &s;ome Souldiers. But &s;eeing they could not take po&s;t for want of Earth, that they could not force the Pallizado'd Retrenchment behind the breach, and that the chief Officers were already all hurt or &s;lain, by the continual fire of the be|&s;ieged; it was thought expedient to make a re|treat; five or &s;ix leap'd over the Turks Retrench|ment, but being ill followed, got off with the re&s;t. The Regiments of <HI>Souches</HI> and <HI>Mansfeld</HI> &s;uffered mo&s;t in this Action, and that of <HI>Staren|burg</HI> was al&s;o ill treated. There were more than four hundred kill'd and wounded, but the lo&s;s of &s;o many brave Officers and Voluntiers who lo&s;t their Lives there, were particularly deplo|red: but few that were hurt e&s;caped, which be|got a belief that the Turks &s;hot with envenom|ed Bullets. Among&s;t the dead were Count <HI>Her|ber&s;tein,</HI>
<PB N="324" REF="159">Count <HI>Kuff&s;tein,</HI> and another Captain of the &s;ame Regiment, the Baron <HI>Rolle,</HI> three Captains more, and eight Lieutenants and En|&s;igns. Of Voluntiers that were &s;lain there, or died of their Wounds, the Duke of <HI>Vexar,</HI> a Grandee of <HI>Spain,</HI> who was one of the fir&s;t upon the breach, was one, a Son of Prince <HI>Roberts,</HI> with another Engli&s;h Lord, the Baron of <HI>Scheyf|fer,</HI> the young Count of <HI>Courmaillon,</HI> a Conte of <HI>Dona,</HI> and &s;even or eight more of Quality. Among&s;t the wounded, as well Officers as Vo|luntiers, were reckoned Count <HI>Guydo Starenburg,</HI> Count <HI>Aver&s;perg,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Veldens</HI> of the Hou&s;e of the Palatinat, Prince <HI>Picolomini,</HI> two Engli&s;h Lords, the Duke of <HI>E&s;calona,</HI> a Grandee of <HI>Spain,</HI> the Marque&s;s of <HI>Valero,</HI> Brother to the Duke of <HI>Vexar,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Commercy,</HI> and more than thirty other Per&s;ons of mark. The <HI>Spani|ards</HI> and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by a noble Emulation, oppo&s;ing the greate&s;t Fury of the Turks. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were &s;o ill treated, that of twenty of them, all Per&s;ons of Quality, there were but &s;ix of them that were not &s;lain or wounded. The lo&s;s of the be&s;ieged was al&s;o great, for they had two hundred of their bra|ve&s;t men wounded and killed. The Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and Mar&s;hal Count <HI>Starenburg</HI> were pre|&s;ent in this Action, giving Orders every where as occa&s;ion required. It was believed that the <HI>Brandenburgers</HI> would have attempted &s;omewhat on their &s;ide, but they excu&s;ed it becau&s;e their breach was not large enough. On the <HI>Bavarian</HI> &s;ide there was a notable breach made in the Rondel and in the Wall that covers the Ca&s;tle, which the be&s;ieged repaired by Night with Ga|bions, Pallizadoes, and Fagots.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> the fourteenth, The whole Night and Day were imployed in inhuming the Dead, and repairing the Approaches, in planting more Cannon upon the Batteries, and in advancing the Mines. Two Galleries were likewi&s;e fra|med betwixt the &s;econd and third Rondel. The Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> having al&s;o &s;ent for three Re|giments of Hor&s;e from <HI>Alba-Regalis</HI> to reinforce General <HI>Mercy,</HI> they pa&s;&s;ed the Bridge this Morning to go on <HI>Pe&s;t</HI> &s;ide.

His Electoral Highne&s;s having cau&s;ed eight Pa|rapets of thick Oaken Planks to be made, &s;hod with Iron, of a new Invention, each capable of &s;ecuring a hundred armed Men, they were thought proper to be u&s;ed in Attacks and A&s;|&s;aults. The &s;ame day the <HI>Bavarians</HI> di&s;covered and di&s;appointed two Mines of the Enemies.</P>
<P><HI>July 15th,</HI> They continued to work in their Lines, and being lodged clo&s;e to the Wall, the Be&s;ieged were heard to work under the Breach. <HI>Gonzales</HI> the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Engineer being now come, Bombs and Carca&s;&s;es were thrown into the Town, which did great Execution. Upon the Advice that the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> had, that the Turks that had pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Tibi&s;cus</HI> near <HI>Segedin,</HI> were &s;till encamped under the Cannon of <HI>Hat|wan,</HI> he cau&s;ed two Regiments of Hor&s;e more to joyn <HI>Mercy</HI> to oblige the Enemy to repa&s;s the <HI>Tibi&s;cus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>July 16th,</HI> A new Battery was rai&s;ed in the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack without the Wall of the lower Town to the right again&s;t the great Rondel, the which was al&s;o batter'd on the other &s;ide to render the Breach larger, and them&s;elves Ma|&s;ters of it. A <HI>Ra&s;cian,</HI> with Letters which the Governour of the Place had entru&s;ted him to carry to him of <HI>Alb-Royal,</HI> came and deliver|ed them to the Duke; but they being writ in the <HI>Armenian</HI> Language, and no Interpreter in the Camp, they were &s;ent to <HI>Vienna</HI> to be decy|phered. Some Pea&s;ants got out of the Town reported, that the Janizaries had begun to mur|mur again&s;t the Ba&s;&s;a, as de&s;igning to hold out to the la&s;t extremity, but that he had by the Puni&s;hment of the mo&s;t mutinous, by his Libe|rality, and the a&s;&s;urance he had given them of &s;peedy relief, rea&s;&s;ured them to that degree, that they promi&s;ed to hold out with their Lives. This Evening the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> commanded 150 men, &s;econded by a greater number to go and attack the Palizado which was in the Ditch at the foot of the Rondel of the Ca&s;tle. Lieutenant-General Count <HI>Fountain</HI> was on the right of the Attack, and General Count <HI>A&s;premont</HI> at the left. They u&s;ed three of the above mentioned wooden Parapets for the fir&s;t time with Succe&s;s, and they attack'd this Po&s;t &s;o vigorou&s;ly, that they carried it with their Swords in their Hands, cutting in pieces all them that defended it, but they &s;old their Lives dearly, being the A&s;&s;ailants lo&s;t Count <HI>Fountaine</HI> and 35 Souldiers, and Vo|luntiers. Count <HI>A&s;permont</HI> received a Contu&s;ion in his Head by the &s;troke of a Mu&s;quet which knock'd off his Steel Cap. The Captains <HI>Gotta|linsky</HI> and <HI>Vaubon</HI> were dangerou&s;ly hurt, with di|vers others. This Po&s;t gave acce&s;s to the Ron|del.</P>
<P><HI>July 17th,</HI> Ye&s;terday the Be&s;ieged began to fire from a new Battery of four great Guns, which they had rai&s;ed upon the inward Wall; but General <HI>Starenberg</HI> having commanded all the Cannon that could bear to &s;hoot that way, they were quickly &s;ilenced and di&s;abled. About Noon twenty or thirty Janizaries appeared upon the Breach of the Rondel to the right, as if they had de&s;igned a Sally, but tho&s;e in the Trenches having given them a Volly, they quickly reti|red. The <HI>Brandenburgers</HI> and <HI>Bavarians</HI> did no|thing but compleat their Works, be&s;ides their continual firing from their Batteries.</P>
<P><HI>July 18th,</HI> A new line was advanced to the right, the better to cover the Miners, and be of u&s;e in the &s;ub&s;equent A&s;&s;ault. The <HI>Brandenbur|gers</HI> augmented their great Battery with three pieces of Cannon. Nor were the <HI>Bavarians</HI> idle, their Miners working under the Wall behind the Pallizado Moat, of which they were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The Be&s;ieged did not much appear by day, but in the Night time kept continual firing, killing a great many of the Be&s;iegers with their Stones and Granadoes, which they threw into their Works.</P>
<P><HI>Jul.</HI> 19. The Cannon was mounted upon the new Battery, and the Line was &s;trengthned with two &s;mall Forts. La&s;t night the Be&s;ieged &s;prung a Mine behind our Miners, who worked under the Wall, which endammaged our Mine, into which a new entry was to be made to make it &s;erviceable. Some of the Chri&s;tian Miners were covered with earth, mo&s;t of which were pulled out again, except <HI>Libert</HI> their Captain, who could not be found. Mr. <HI>Kerry,</HI> a <HI>Scotch</HI> Gentleman, with &s;even or eight Souldiers were killed in the ap|proaches, be&s;ides others wounded. The Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the General per&s;ons of his Ar|my, held a Council of War this morning, but the re&s;ult was kept &s;ecret. Some De&s;erters a&s;&s;u|red the Duke, that the Be&s;ieged re&s;olved to make no compo&s;ition, but to expect the Relief which the Grand <HI>Vi&s;ier</HI> would bring them.</P>
<P><HI>Jul.</HI> 20. The new Line in the <HI>Lorrain</HI> attack was compleated. There were three fal&s;e alarms given to hara&s;s the Be&s;ieged, by cau&s;ing &s;ome Granadeers to run up the Breach, and throw their Granado's into the place, upon which the Turks ha&s;tening to the defence, they were &s;alu|ted
<PB N="325" REF="159">with Volleys of Cannon, Bombs, and Car|ka&s;&s;es, not without execution. The&s;e kind of attacks were frequently u&s;ed to keep the Enemy in continual alarms, and in ignorance of the time of the real A&s;&s;ault. In the mean time the Mines were vigorou&s;ly carried on, and a certain <HI>German</HI> undertook a new one, which he under|took to fini&s;h in two or three days. In the attacks of <HI>Brandenburg</HI> and <HI>Bavaria,</HI> the Miners hoped to be the following Night under the Rondels, con|tinuing to batter the Walls with great fury, and to &s;hoot glowing Bullets, Bombs and Carka&s;&s;es into the City, which produced much di&s;order. Upon advice that the Turks di&s;po&s;ed them&s;elves to attempt to put relief into the Town, the Ditch of the Circumvallation was deepened, and forti|fied with certain Redoubts, the better to &s;ecure the Be&s;iegers, to which purpo&s;e 200 <HI>Heyducks</HI> were added to the number of Pioneers.</P>
<P><HI>Jul.</HI> 21. The principal working was now at the Mines, which were made in three &s;everal places, and would &s;uddenly be ready. Captain <HI>Libert,</HI> not|with&s;tanding all the diligence that had been u&s;ed to dig and remove the earth to &s;eek him, had not been found. He was a <HI>Walloon</HI> by Nation, and was regretted by all the Generals, and &s;uch who had skill of his knowledge in conducting of Mines. The Miners were now within hearing of each other. A Battery was al&s;o rai&s;ed for four Mortars, near the three <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Pieces which beat upon the Rondel on the right, and they re|&s;olved to approach all the Cannon and Mortars nearer the Breaches, to batter them with more force, that they might inlarge them with more ea&s;e, and ruine the Enemies Defences, which were behind the &s;aid Breaches. There were twenty-&s;even &s;lain and wounded only at the <HI>Lorrain</HI> at|tack; among&s;t the dead were Major <HI>Bacneburg</HI> a <HI>Dane,</HI> and Captain <HI>Lerneux</HI> the <HI>5th</HI> of <HI>Starenberg</HI>'s Regiment. <HI>Gonzales</HI>'s Bombs and Carca&s;&s;es had the Succe&s;s expected, and by report of a Fugi|tive, one of tho&s;e Bombs &s;unck into a Hou&s;e where a hundred Per&s;ons of both Sexes were re|tired, who all mi&s;erably peri&s;hed in the Ruines of it. The <HI>Bavarians</HI> fini&s;hed their Battery near the Rondel, and began another on the Water &s;ide, to canonade the Flancks of the City on that &s;ide. At pre&s;ent, being the three Attacks were ad|vanced as far as the Breaches, which were large enough, all things were di&s;po&s;ed for a general A&s;&s;ault, two thou&s;and Ladders being got ready for fal&s;e and &s;eeming Attacks by &s;caling the Walls, whil&s;t others mounted the Breaches.</P>
<P><HI>July 22th,</HI> There hapned nothing at the <HI>Lorrain</HI> or <HI>Brandenburg</HI> Attack, the Turks &s;prung two Mines this Morning, which did nothing but ru|ine a part of the Curtain, where there was no Breach. The new Battery of four Guns upon the brink of the Ditch of the Rondel in the <HI>Ba|varian</HI> Attack being fini&s;hed, the Turks came there at break of day, and gave them a bloody Serenade, for a &s;trong party of them having &s;lipped out by the Bridge on the right, they crept into the Ditch along the Pali&s;ade, and be|ing come to the Battery, before they were di&s;co|vered, by favour of the Darkne&s;s, they began to howl and make terrible cries, nailing up three Cannon, and a Mortar, and ruining part of the Battery: The <HI>Saxons</HI> of the neighbouring Po&s;ts ran to the noi&s;e, but were di&s;ordered. The Re|giment of Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Baden,</HI> which was up|on the Re&s;erve, arrived &s;ea&s;onably, and repul|&s;ed the Turks with the lo&s;s of thirty men, which was but a &s;orry compen&s;ation con&s;idering the lo&s;s on the other &s;ide, where above one hundred were killed and wounded, the mo&s;t <HI>Saxons</HI> and <HI>Bavarians.</HI> Among&s;t the &s;lain, Collonel <HI>Lebel,</HI> a <HI>Saxon</HI> was one, be&s;ides &s;everal Subalternes, and <HI>Ge&s;chwint,</HI> Collonel of the Artillery, was dange|rou&s;ly wounded with a Cymitar. The Turks got no great advantage by this Sally, for the Nailes being ea&s;ily drawn, they began in a very little time to play again, as if they never had been nailed. And the revenge which was re|turned was &s;udden and fatal, for a Bomb of the <HI>Bavarians</HI> falling into the Magazine of Powder in the Ca&s;tle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ca&s;tle is blown up.</NOTE> blew it up with &s;uch a terrible de|&s;truction and noi&s;e, that the whole City did not only tremble with the blow, but al&s;o the whole Camp, and, as was afterward reported by &s;ome fugitives, more than one thou&s;and per&s;ons of all ages were buried in the ruines, the &s;tones being thrown up with the violence of the Powder in &s;uch abundance, that they fell like Hail into the approaches, that many of the Be&s;iegers were hurt by them.</P>
<P><HI>Jul.</HI> 23. The Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> his Mines be|ing now all ready, and all things ready for an a&s;&s;ault, &s;ent the Count of <HI>Koning&s;ec</HI> with an In|terpreter to the Be&s;ieged to &s;ummon them to &s;urrender. In this interval there was a ce&s;&s;ation of Arms on both &s;ides, which was employed in burying the &s;lain. The &s;aid Count, after two hours &s;tay, returned into the Camp with a Letter from <HI>Abdi Ba&s;&s;a,</HI> in a Pur&s;e of Crim&s;on Damask, which he delivered the Duke. The an&s;wer was fierce and arrogant, implying, that not being nece&s;&s;itated to &s;urrender, he could not be capable of &s;o abject a thought, that he fought for the glory of his <HI>Prophet,</HI> and the honour of the <HI>Mu&s;&s;elmen;</HI> that he and his Garri&s;on were re&s;ol|ved to try the utmo&s;t extremity, and to defend the place with their late&s;t breath. That the Go|vernment had been intru&s;ted to his care by the Grand Seignior, which he would pre&s;erve for him, or lo&s;e his life; that when the Duke &s;hould come to wre&s;t it from him, he &s;hould find him upon the Breach to di&s;pute his entrance, and that he might order the a&s;&s;ault when he plea&s;ed, he would expect him there without &s;tirring a foot. The Duke having read this brave an&s;wer, cau|&s;ed all the Batteries to fire with more fury than formerly, and all the preparatives for a general A&s;&s;ault to be made ready, for which purpo&s;e he &s;ent for &s;ome thou&s;ands of <HI>Hungarian</HI> Foot, who had voluntarily offered to be the fir&s;t that &s;hould mount the Breaches.</P>
<P>So fierce an an&s;wer and &s;o brave a defence, makes it apparent, that the impre&s;&s;ions which the Run-aways had at the beginning of the Siege given of <HI>Abdi Ba&s;&s;a</HI>'s conduct, were very fal&s;e, affirming he was de&s;pi&s;ed by the Souldiery, as being more a Merchant than a Man of War; and the <HI>Sera&s;quier</HI> was in the wrong in de&s;igning to remove him, for it is to be pre&s;umed that &s;carce any other would have eluded the efforts of &s;o great an Army &s;o long time. A <HI>Pole</HI> was ob&s;erved by the Guards in &s;ecret conference with two Turks, but upon his return to the Camp was &s;ei&s;ed upon, vi&s;ited and examined, and be|ing found to be a Spy, he was immediately hanged. This evening a <HI>Bavarian</HI> Gunner was apprahended, as he was going over to the Ene|my.</P>
<P><HI>Jul. 24th,</HI> This morning about eight a Clock a great Mine was &s;prung in the <HI>Lorrain</HI> attack, and 300 men were commanded to lodge upon the Breach, together with &s;ome hundreds of <HI>Hungarians,</HI> but the Mine had a contrary effect to what was de&s;igned, for it ruined and over|threw part of their own Approaches, and filled their Lines with Earth, be&s;ides the &s;laughters of 100 men killed and wounded. The Duke upon this ill &s;ucce&s;s, cau&s;ed the firings of the Batteries
<PB N="326" REF="160">to be redoubled to enlarge the Breaches, to ren|der them in a Condition to be mounted without any new Mines. The new Battery which the <HI>Bavarians</HI> rais'd by the Water &s;ide would be rea|dy at Night, and that which they had already rai&s;ed upon the brink of the Ditch, had made a great gap in the Wall on the right. By inter|cepted Letters he was al&s;o informed, that the Great Vi&s;ier highly encouraged the Be&s;ieged to defend them&s;elves, a&s;&s;uring them that by the eighth or tenth of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> he would come to their relief with a formidable Army. General <HI>Caraffa</HI> who commanded the Imperial Troops upon the River <HI>Tibi&s;cus,</HI> &s;ent an Officer to the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> with an acccount of a great Advantage which he had had over the Garri&s;on of <HI>Agria</HI> by the means of two Ambu&s;hes which he had laid for the Turks, which luck'd &s;o well, that having drawn &s;ix hundred of the Garri&s;on into them, he quite defeated them, killed three hundred upon the Place, with <HI>O&s;man</HI> Ba&s;&s;a the Commander of <HI>Agria,</HI> and took forty Pri&s;oners, together with the <HI>Vice</HI> Ba&s;&s;a, who was dangerou&s;ly wounded.</P>
<P><HI>July 25th,</HI> The whole Night was &s;pent in re|pairing the Works ruined by the Mine, which had been &s;prung with &s;o much di&s;advantage. The Duke pre&s;&s;ed forward the Preparatives for the General A&s;&s;ault with all po&s;&s;ible Vigour, having ordered the making of Places of Arms, or Parades, as were nece&s;&s;ary, within the Lines and Approaches. Betwixt four and five the Be|&s;ieged put fire to a Mine on the right of the Rondel, in pur&s;uance whereof they &s;allied with two hundred Men, but were repul&s;ed by the Guard that were in readine&s;s with the lo&s;s of fourteen men. A little after, they &s;allied again in greater numbers to the left, where the <HI>Bran|denburgers</HI> were, who likewi&s;e repul&s;ed them. They returned yet the third time with more Troops, and put the <HI>Brandenburgers</HI> Guards into di&s;order, which obliged the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> to order the Re&s;erve which was po&s;ted at the Wall of the lower Town to advance, which General <HI>Souches,</HI> who commanded the Trenches, had di|vided into three parts, whereof one was placed to the left on the Water &s;ide, another in the Approaches, and the third was commanded to keep by the Mo&s;que. The Duke moreover cau|&s;ed the Battalions of <HI>Mansfelt, Salm, Souches,</HI> and <HI>Lorrain,</HI> to advance to the right. The Skirmi&s;h|ing la&s;ted a good time, the Turks retiring of|ten, and as &s;oon returning with great fury and out-cryes. The <HI>Hayducks</HI> after the fir&s;t di&s;charge did al&s;o charge the Turks, but gave way, occa|&s;ioning much confu&s;ion among&s;t them upon the left of the Mo&s;que, from whence the Be&s;ieged gave brisk fire with their Cannon, though with|out any great harm, &s;o that &s;eeing they could profit nothing by a longer &s;tay, they retired into the Town. Count <HI>Starenberg,</HI> who had &s;ignali|zed him&s;elf, luck'd better than his Adjoutant, who had both his Legs &s;hot off. The Battalions of <HI>Souches</HI> and <HI>Mansfelt</HI> were ill treated, and had mo&s;t dead. The Baron of <HI>A&s;thi</HI> was hurt in the Foot, and the Baron of <HI>Hoghenworth</HI> &s;lain, and &s;everal &s;ubaltern Officers killed and hurt, be&s;ides above a hundred private Souldiers. But the lo&s;s on the Enemies &s;ide was much greater, as was reported by a Dutch Boy who run out of Town, where he had been &s;ince the Siege of <HI>Vienna,</HI> ha|ving been &s;old by a <HI>Tartar</HI> to a Citizen of <HI>Buda.</HI> This Boy &s;aid further, that the Turks made great Retrenchments within the Place, and that the Garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ted &s;till of at lea&s;t five thou|&s;and fighting men.</P>
<P><HI>July 26th,</HI> Never was more Diligence u&s;ed &s;ince the Siege began in carrying on the Lines and Approaches, than la&s;t Night, and all this Day to make the Places of Arms, which are fi|ni&s;hed, and at pre&s;ent every thing is di&s;po&s;ed of for the general A&s;&s;ault, and po&s;ting them&s;elves upon the Breaches, the Rondels, and the Walls, and con&s;equently to render them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of this important Place, which had co&s;t the Chri&s;tians &s;o much Blood. The Be&s;ieged made a little &s;ally on the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Attack, but having &s;tood the fir&s;t di&s;charge, were forced to retreat as fa&s;t as they came.</P>
<P><HI>July 27th,</HI> Every thing being di&s;po&s;ed for the general A&s;&s;ault, and the Troops that were to be employed in it at their Rendezvouzes in all the three Attacks, it was re&s;olved that the On&s;et &s;hould be given at five a Clock in the Evening, to which end the Duke had di&s;tribu|ted his Orders to all the Officers high and low, how they were to act. The Faggots, Gabions, Spades, Mattocks, Hatchets, and Sacks with Earth, were there in great abundance, as well to break the Enemies Retrenchments, as to co|ver the A&s;&s;ailants when they &s;hould be Ma&s;ters of the Breaches. The &s;ignal was given from <HI>Pe&s;t</HI> by &s;ome Cannon &s;hot, and the A&s;&s;ault was carried on in manner following. Forty Grana|deers under the command of a Captain, one Lieutenant, and one Serjeant, were at the head of the Rondel to the right hand, they were fol|lowed by fifty Fu&s;eliers and Souldiers, with Hatchets, commanded al&s;o by a Captain-Lieu|tenant, and a Serjeant, with a hundred men carrying Spades and Mattocks, &s;upported by two Captains, two Lieutenants, two Serjeants, and two hundred Mu&s;queteers, all under the Con|duct of the Prince of <HI>Newburg,</HI> Great Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Teutonick</HI> Order, who had the Direction of this Attack. That of the middle toward the Curtain was directed by Lieutenant General <HI>Sou|ches;</HI> there were fifty Granadeers under a Cap|tain, Lieutenant and Serjeant, a hundred Fu&s;e|liers, two hundred men with Hatchets, and to &s;econd them two hundred Mu&s;queteers, divided into two &s;quadrons, which were followed with a hundred and fifty more, with Shovels and Mattocks: The Attack on the left of the little Rondel was ordered by the <HI>Brandenburgers</HI> after the &s;ame manner. Behind the Sacks filled with Earth, Wooll, and the like, in the &s;econd line were po&s;ted a party of choice Harquebu&s;iers, who were not to &s;tir thence, but fire continually upon the Turks, who &s;tood there them&s;elves in the Breaches. The <HI>Heyducks,</HI> commanded by the Lieutenant Governour of <HI>Raab,</HI> were po&s;ted on the Water &s;ide, where a great part of the Wall had been thrown down by the fire of the Maga|zin already mentioned; they were only to make a fal&s;e Attack, being &s;econded by a Major with &s;ome &s;elect Companies. The chief Officers were di&s;per&s;ed into &s;everal Po&s;ts to execute the fun|ctions of their Employments; and thus <HI>Nigrelli,</HI> General of Battalia, Collonel <HI>Keth,</HI> Lieutenant Collonel <HI>Rederer,</HI> and the Major of <HI>Staremberg</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted the grand Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Teutonick</HI> Order. General <HI>Souches</HI> had for A&s;&s;i&s;tants <HI>Diependal,</HI> Count <HI>Octtingen,</HI> Lieutenant Collonel <HI>Jorger,</HI> and the Major of <HI>Crop</HI>'s Regiment. There were above 1200 men of re&s;erves in the covered way, com|manded by General <HI>Thungen,</HI> under twelve Cap|tains, twelve Lieutenants, and other &s;ubaltern Officers, with all the other Lieutenant Collo|nels and Majors, to &s;ucceed in the place of tho&s;e that &s;hould be &s;lain or wounded. The 1200 Mu&s;queteers were to advance in &s;mall parties in the Lines as the other gained ground; the re&s;t of the Foot were at their Arms ready to engage,
<PB N="327" REF="160">and all the Generals in the Trenches. In this order the Souldiers full of Hopes and Courage went to the A&s;&s;ault, and mounted the Breaches. They found great Oppo&s;ition, particularly at the great Rondel where the Breach was high, and the Defendants very numerous and re&s;olute. The Chri&s;tians were beat back two or three times, but returning &s;till to the A&s;&s;ault, they at length took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Breach, and po&s;ted them&s;elves in it. The <HI>Brandenburgers</HI> took the Wall of the little Rondel. The Combat la&s;ted from five till nine a Clock with great effu&s;ion of Blood, not &s;o much by the Turks Arms as their Mines, and Powder which they had &s;trewed in great quantities in &s;everal places, which they &s;ucce&s;&s;ively fired as they were forced from their Po&s;ts. There could be nothing more lamentable than to &s;ee two or three hundred men at once to&s;&s;ed up by force of the Mines, which were mo&s;t killed, or grievou&s;ly wounded. And yet the Be|&s;ieged could not terrifie the Chri&s;tians, nor hin|der them by their ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance to lodge upon the Rondels and the Curtain. The <HI>Hay|ducks</HI> apprehending the fire, failed in their fal&s;e alarming on the Water &s;ide. The Duke and General <HI>Staremberg</HI> were near the Great Ma&s;ter with their Swords in their Hands, encouraging the Officers and Souldiers to do well, and the Prince of <HI>Croy</HI> was in the middle near the Cur|tain, where he was hurt. The Night being come put an end to the fight, and it was &s;pent in &s;e|curing their Lodgments with two Lines of Com|munication from the Approaches to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Rondels, and the Miners were fa&s;tned to the in|ner Wall or Retrenchment, where the Turks fortified them&s;elves. This A&s;&s;ault was one of the bloodie&s;t, the mo&s;t hardy, and be&s;t di&s;puted that ever was &s;een, whether we con&s;ider the bravery and intrepidne&s;s of the A&s;&s;ailants, or the ob&s;tinate Valour of the Defendants. The number of the &s;lain, among&s;t whom was Adjou|tant General <HI>Attein,</HI> was not very great, but that of the wounded very &s;urpri&s;ing, of which Ca|talogue were the Prince of <HI>Croy,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Commercy,</HI> General <HI>Diependael,</HI> General <HI>Thungen,</HI> the Baron of <HI>A&s;ti,</HI> the Major of <HI>Starenberg,</HI> Lieu|tenant Collonel <HI>Redere,</HI> Major <HI>Pini,</HI> Conte, <HI>Schlick,</HI> Baron <HI>Gera,</HI> and many other <HI>Captains</HI> and &s;ub|alterne Officers. On the <HI>Brandenburg</HI> &s;ide, Count <HI>Dona,</HI> Collonel of Foot was &s;lain, Major <HI>Marwitz,</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Curland</HI> grievou&s;ly wounded, with very many others.</P>
<P>At the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Attack the Elector had order|ed the A&s;&s;ault in this manner. The Palizades upon the Breach having been burnt the day be|fore by forty choice Souldiers, the Elector com|manded a Lieutenant with 20 Fu&s;eliers, a <HI>Serje|ant,</HI> &s;ix Voluntiers, and ten Granadeers, and a Corporal, with &s;ix Carpenters to cut the Paliza|does, an 100 Mu&s;queteers with their Officers were ordered to po&s;t them&s;elves at the Enemies Pali|zade, and to &s;hoot without cea&s;ing to favori&s;e the Pioneers to make the Lodgment upon the Rondel, among&s;t which there were twenty five with Spades and Pickaxes and 75 with Hatchets commanded by a Captain, and &s;econded by a Lieutenant-Collonel, a Major and a Captain, with fifty men armed with half Pikes, Halberds, and Partizans, by a Lieutenant with thirty Grana|deers, and by 200 Mu&s;quetters under two Captains and two Lieutenants. Things being thus di&s;po|&s;ed as well on the right as the left, the two Neigh|bouring Redoubts were furni&s;hed each with thirty Harquebu&s;iers, and three Battalions of <HI>Imperiali&s;ts, Bavarians</HI> and <HI>Saxons,</HI> were to &s;econd the A&s;&s;ailants. The Gunners had order to fire from all the Bat|teries, and to throw Bombs and Carca&s;&s;es with|out cea&s;ing into the Ca&s;tle, and betwixt the two Walls on the Water &s;ide, as al&s;o to point their Cannon again&s;t the high Walls and Windows of the Ca&s;tle. All things being thus ordered, and the &s;ignal given from <HI>Pe&s;t,</HI> they advanced towards the Breach, however difficult to mount on the right and left of the Rondel, as al&s;o the Curtain, and that with &s;o much Vigour, that they became Ma&s;ters of the Po&s;t, driving out the Be&s;ieged for all their ince&s;&s;ant firing, and a &s;hower of Stones which they threw from their Ca&s;tle Windows. They al&s;o took the <HI>Swingher,</HI> which is a great Place in form of a retreat betwixt the Walls and the Hou&s;es, but this Place being commanded by the &s;aid Walls, whence the Turks annoyed the Aggre&s;&s;ors with Granadoes, Stones, and Bombs which they rolled down; the Elector cau&s;ed tho&s;e that were there to retire, being content to &s;ecure the Lodgments upon the Rondel, and the Wall of the Ca&s;tle by a Line of Communication from the Gate of the Bridge to that of the <HI>Swingher,</HI> &s;o that the Bridge remained in their Power, which was further &s;ecured by traver&s;e Lines, and two Redoubts. The Elector eminently appeared in all this Action, and the Generals &s;ignalized their Courage, as did al&s;o the Voluntiers, Officers and Souldiers, who fought with all the bravery that was to be expected from men of Courage. Nor were the Turks le&s;s commendable for their Con|&s;tancy and Fidelity, doing every thing that op|pre&s;&s;ed Valour could be capable of. They who defended the Rondel and the Swinger were for the mo&s;t part killed and hurt. There were eight pieces of Cannon found there, and two Mortars turned now again&s;t the Be&s;iegeds &s;econd Wall and Retrenchments. In this A&s;&s;ault, of the <HI>Ba|varians</HI> there were &s;lain two Majors, two Captains, four Lieutenants, one En&s;ign, but the wounded were many; one Collonel, two Lieutenant-Col|lonels, two Majors, 25 Captains, 16 Lieutenants, thirteen En&s;igns. The Generals <HI>Lavergne, Rummel,</HI> and <HI>A&s;premont</HI> were of the number of the woun|ded, as al&s;o the Duke of <HI>E&s;calona,</HI> a Grandee of <HI>Spain,</HI> and &s;ome other Voluntiers of Quality, making up with the Officers and Souldiers the number of 117 &s;lain, and 972 wounded. Of the Troops of <HI>Saxony,</HI> a Lieutenant-Collonel, and &s;ome under Officer were killed; one Lieutenant-Collonel, two Majors, two Captains, one Cap|tain-Lieutenant, and three En&s;igns were hurt; of the Souldiers there were &s;eventy &s;lain, and a hundred ninety nine wounded; &s;o that the number of the &s;lain and wounded in this A&s;&s;ault amounted to above three thou&s;and men.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 28, In the three Attacks they were only employed in burying their dead, and &s;ecuring their Lodgments upon the Breaches. The Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> did al&s;o apply the Miner to the &s;econd Wall, which was done in three &s;everal Places, as did al&s;o they of <HI>Bavaria</HI> and <HI>Brandenburg.</HI></P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 29. The three Mines in the &s;econd Wall were &s;prung with that Succe&s;s that they made a new Breach there, and filled part of the Ditch with the Ruins. The <HI>Bavarians</HI> advanced to the right of the Rondel, and &s;eized two Mortars there, which they turned again&s;t the Be&s;ieged. The great Cannon was advanced, and they pretended to batter the City with an 100 pieces of Ordnance, and forty Mortars, if the Turks continued in their Ob&s;tinacy. The Be&s;ieged how&s;oever made &s;eve|ral Cuts and Retrenchments behind the &s;econd Wall. The Duke &s;eeing that well nigh all the Generals of the Infantry were hurt and in no Condition to act, order'd for the future that the Generals of the Hor&s;e &s;hould &s;erve in the Ap|proaches, to wit, the Count of <HI>Stirum,</HI> and the Conte of <HI>Lodron,</HI> and &s;o the fir&s;t mounted the

Some <HI>Ra&s;cians</HI> come out of the place, reported, that the be&s;ieged were re&s;ol|ved to defend them&s;elves to the la&s;t extremity, but that &s;ome began to waver, &s;aying, the further effu&s;ion of bloud ought to be prevented. A Coun|cil of War was held thereupon, and the re&s;ult was, that the Duke &s;hould &s;end a &s;econd Summons to the Commander of the place, <HI>to &s;urrender whil&s;t it was time, and that he might do it upon honourable con|ditions, which if neglected he would not be an&s;werable for the bloud that &s;hould be &s;pilt, if they came to the la&s;t extremity, being in that ca&s;e they &s;hould spare neither Sex nor Age. Abdi Ba&s;&s;a</HI> civilly received his High|ne&s;s's Letters, and demanded a Day to con&s;ult with the other Officers of his Garri&s;on, which was granted him, with a ce&s;&s;ation of Arms. The De&s;erters, who e&s;caped in great numbers, affirm'd that the Be&s;ieged lo&s;t in the la&s;t A&s;&s;ault, in the <HI>Bavarian</HI> attack, only 300 &s;lain, and 700 hurt. They had that Night notice that 4000 Turki&s;h Hor&s;e were &s;een within four Leagues of the Camp, to enquire into the &s;tate of the place, but fearing a &s;urpri&s;e, they pre&s;ently retired.</P>
<P><HI>Jul.</HI> 31. At nine in the Morning the Count of <HI>Launberg,</HI> Adjoutant General, was commanded by the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> to go with an Interpreter, and received the Be&s;ieged's an&s;wer, which was to this purpo&s;e, <HI>That he neither could nor would &s;o ea&s;ily &s;urrender the City, it being the Key of the Ottoman Em|pire; but if they would make a general peace, they would give another equivalent.</HI> After noon the Be&s;ieged demanded a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of Arms at the <HI>Bavarian</HI> attack, and &s;ent two <HI>Aga</HI>'s in Ho&s;tage to the Elector, who &s;ent the Baron of <HI>Creuz</HI> Lieutenant Collonel of <HI>Baden</HI>'s Regiment with an Interpreter. The Turks received them with great ceremony, and all imaginable civilities. He was not immediate|ly conducted before the Ba&s;&s;a, but to another Hou&s;e, the &s;treets as he pa&s;&s;ed along were lined with Souldiers in very good order, though no great number. Being entered into the Hou&s;e, he was pre&s;ented with Rice, a ro&s;ted Pullet, little Py<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s, Coffee and Wine. The Ba&s;&s;a excu&s;ed him&s;elf, <HI>That he could not yet &s;peak with him, being he con&s;ulted the other chief Officers upon the propo&s;iti|ons he was to make to him.</HI> In this interval of time many Turki&s;h Officers came to &s;alute the Baron: half an hour after the Ba&s;&s;a &s;ent him word, <HI>That he would take it for a favour if he would come over to him.</HI> Which he immediately did, accompanied with a great number of Turks, being taken by the arms by the two chiefe&s;t of them, accord|ing to the cu&s;tom of the <HI>Ottomans,</HI> who led him thus before the Ba&s;&s;a, who was in a Lodge of Wood over-again&s;t his Hou&s;e, very well furni|&s;hed and hung with rich Tapi&s;tries. Having cau&s;ed the Baron to &s;it down, he u&s;ed this di&s;|cour&s;e to him, <HI>That he was &s;orry to find him&s;elf in a place of that importance, that had been &s;o often be&s;ieged without &s;ucce&s;s, and was now &s;o long abandoned with|out relief. On the contrary, that he found him&s;elf pre&s;|&s;ed by the Emperour's Son-in-law, and the grand Vi&s;ier, that he wi&s;hed he were able to give his re&s;olution con|cerning the &s;urrender, but that being an affair of the la&s;t importance, and as much as his life was worth, it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to re&s;olve upon a &s;urrender.</HI> Ad|ding however, <HI>That if they would demand any other place in Hungary, he would cau&s;e it immediately to be evacuated for them:</HI> The Baron replied, <HI>That he had no Commi&s;&s;ion to di&s;cour&s;e of conditions, but only to know from the Ba&s;&s;a him&s;elf whether he would &s;urrender or no. That he might plea&s;e to con&s;ider that the Chri|&s;tians were already Ma&s;ters of the Walls of the City, that it would be too late to capitulate, if he &s;tayed till another a&s;&s;ault, that it would not be in the power of the Generals to re&s;train the fury of the Souldiers, or prevent this Siege from being as Tragical as that of Newheu&s;el.</HI> At this di&s;cour&s;e the Ba&s;&s;a only lift up his &s;houl|ders, but the Baron being upon the point to take his leave, he de&s;ired him to enter with him in|to his Cabinet, where, calling the <HI>Mufti</HI> and three other Turks of the fir&s;t rank, he remon&s;trated to him again, <HI>That he could not upon any con&s;ideration do &s;o great a prejudice to the</HI> Grand Seignior, <HI>as to &s;urrender a place upon which depended</HI> two hundred Leagues of Country, <HI>and which is the</HI> Key of Turky, <HI>but offered again any Town in Hungary with its Appendances and Dependencies.</HI> Yet declaring fi|nally, <HI>That if they would give him a&s;&s;urances of a ge|neral peace with the Port, he would yet re&s;olve to &s;ur|render Buda.</HI> The Baron having no Orders to treat, took leave of the Ba&s;&s;a, telling him he would make report to the Elector and Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> of the Declaration he had communica|ted to him, but that he could not a&s;&s;ure him that things would be &s;o concluded. The Ba&s;&s;a de&s;ired this Declaration might be publi&s;hed in Writing through the Camp; and invited him to &s;tay all Night in the City: But the Baron ex|cu&s;ed the later, de&s;iring to be reconducted to the place from whence he came, which was done with great ceremony, he being accompanied with many <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Officers to the Gate. Nor the Baron, nor his Interpreter could &s;ufficiently de|mon&s;trate the ruines occa&s;ioned in the City by the Bombs and Carka&s;&s;es which had beaten down the greate&s;t part of the Buildings. The Ce&s;&s;ation which had been ob&s;erved during this Parley was broke towards Evening, the Cannon beginning to fire with more fury than formerly. The Be&s;ieged &s;prang a Counter-mine in the <HI>Lor|rain</HI> attack, to ruine the Chri&s;tians Mine made under their Battery, oppo&s;ite to the great Ron|del, but without &s;ucce&s;s. A while after, two of the Be&s;iegers Mines, which were de&s;igned to fill the Ditch, were fired with execution. Count <HI>Starenberg</HI> looking betwixt two Gabions was hurt with a Musket-&s;hot, but without danger, 20 or 30 more were hurt and killed in this and the <HI>Brandenburg</HI> attack.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 1. A Battery was fini&s;hed in the <HI>Lorrain</HI> attack upon the Rondel, upon which two pieces of Cannon were planted. A Mine was &s;prung in the Morning near this Rondel, and though it &s;ucceeded well, there was no other attempt made, becau&s;e the Moat was not &s;ufficiently filled, and &s;o it was re&s;olved to fill it with Faggots, with Sacks of Earth, and the like Materials, which were carried in abundance upon the place. The Workmen perceived &s;o great a &s;tink in this Mine, that they could &s;carce endure it, two of them, who were &s;uffocated with it, being carried out of it. About Noon, intelligence came that 7000 <HI>Turks</HI> were po&s;ted at <HI>Sexaritwan</HI> thirteen Leagues from <HI>Buda,</HI> and that the <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier</HI> had begun to pa&s;s the Bridge of <HI>E&s;&s;eck</HI> with the Army that he had formed out of the Garri&s;ons of <HI>Hun|gary,</HI> and the Neighbouring places, and with other Troops which he had got together, a|mong&s;t which there were 7000 men drawn out of <HI>Bo&s;&s;ina.</HI> It was further a&s;&s;ured that the defecti|on among&s;t the Turks was very great, and that of 8000 Janizaries, which the <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier</HI> had brought from the middle of Turky, 3000 had de&s;erted upon the march: and yet he pretended his Army con&s;i&s;ted of 50000 Combatants, re&s;ol|ving to attempt the relief of <HI>Bud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> General <HI>Dune|wald</HI> returned this afternoon to the Camp, with the Regiments of Hor&s;e with which he had been on the &s;ide of the Bridge of <HI>E&s;&s;eck,</HI> to inform
<PB N="329" REF="161">him&s;elf of the march of the Enemy. The Ge|nerals <HI>Caraffa</HI> and <HI>Heu&s;ler</HI> arrived al&s;o from <HI>Zol|nock</HI> in two days, with 5000 Hor&s;e and &s;ome <HI>Hungarians.</HI></P>
<P>All things were di&s;po&s;ed for to a&s;&s;ault the &s;e|cond Wall. The <HI>Bavarians</HI> had thrown down a great part of the Wall with their Cannon, and a Mine, rendering them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the &s;e|cond <HI>Zwinger,</HI> where they at the &s;ame time &s;ei|&s;ed upon the Enemies Cannon and Mortars, which they turned again&s;t the City.</P>
<P><HI>Aug. 2d.</HI> They continued to fill the Ditch: every thing was ready for the a&s;&s;ault, which was deferred, becau&s;e of the continual rains. Upon the reiterated news brought in by Scouts of the <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier</HI> having pa&s;&s;ed the Bridge at <HI>E&s;&s;eck,</HI> all nece&s;&s;ary preparations were made to receive him well, in ca&s;e he attempted to relieve the Town.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 3. A Run-away, who pretended to be a Dome&s;tick of one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Offi|cers in the Town, declared, that the Be&s;ieged had prepared a Mine, and begun a &s;econd in the <HI>Brandenburg</HI> attack: That they expected with great impatience their Succours, and that of all tho&s;e which the Ba&s;&s;a had &s;ent out, not one had returned, which rendered him very unea&s;ie and chagrin, and that the number of &s;erviceable <HI>Soldiers</HI> exceeded not 2000 be&s;ides the Inhabitants. The Be&s;iegers could not fini&s;h their great Mine becau&s;e of a Rock they met. Some &s;mall Banks and Parapets were made upon the Breach to &s;e|cure the Souldiers firing during the a&s;&s;ault, which was ordered in the manner following. At noon the Trenches were relieved, and tho&s;e that went off were appointed for re&s;erves. The fir&s;t attack was to the right of the Rondel. Fifty Granadeers with a Captain, and Lieutenant, and a Serjeant followed by 20 men preceded, the&s;e were follow|ed by 50 Fu&s;eliers Officer'd as the fir&s;t, and 50 men which followed them with Hatchets. The &s;ame method was held by the <HI>Brandenburgers</HI> on the left, and the <HI>Hungarians</HI> fell upon the Curtain in the middle, preceded by 30 <HI>Germans,</HI> and fol|lowed by 60 with their nece&s;&s;ary Officers. The a&s;&s;ault began betwixt 5 and 6 a clock in pre&s;ence of all the Generals, the Great Ma&s;ter of the Teu|tonick Order commanding the Trenches. The de&s;ign, by rea&s;on the Mine had not the de&s;ired effect, was but feigned, but the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> being adverti&s;ed by an Adjoutant, that the Ele|ctor of <HI>Bavaria</HI> had already effectively began the a&s;&s;ault, did al&s;o command the fal&s;e attack to be converted into a real one. The Fight la&s;ted two hours. There were 1000 Troopers on foot, 300 whereof were employed in the a&s;&s;ault, who be|haved them&s;elves well, as the <HI>Hungarians</HI> al&s;o did; but the Breach being of difficult a&s;cent, the Be|&s;ieged very well covered with Pali&s;ado's, and de|fending them&s;elves like de&s;perate men, the Duke would not ri&s;que more of his people, contenting him&s;elf to make a Lodgment at the right of the angular Rondel, where 40 men immediately in|trenched them&s;elves. There were not many kil|led by the Be&s;ieged's fire, but about 200 wounded by Stones and Arrows, which were &s;hot in &s;uch abundance that it re&s;embled a &s;hower of Hail. Count <HI>Leopold</HI> of <HI>Herber&s;teyn,</HI> a Lieutenant Collo|nel, Major <HI>Bi&s;chophaw&s;en, &amp;c.</HI> were of the num|ber of the hurt. The <HI>Bavarians</HI> were not exempt from the &s;ame Artillery of Arrows and Stones, be&s;ides Bombs which were rolled upon planks out of the windows of the Ca&s;tle. The Prince of <HI>Savoy</HI> was hurt in the hand with an arrow, toge|ther with 3 Captains, &s;ome &s;ubaltern Officers, 7 or 8 Volunteers, and 90 Souldiers as well kil|led as wounded. Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Baden</HI> going in the morning to view the approaches, was &s;hot with a Musket-bullet which burnt his Coat, and made a great contu&s;ion upon his Bre&s;t, but his Arms being of proof &s;aved his life.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 4. The firing from the Batteries was re|doubled from the three Attacks to enlarge the breaches, and ruine the Defences of the Be&s;ieged. The Line of Circumvallation was &s;trengthened, being furni&s;hed with many Redoubts and Forts to flank the whole work. All the heights and eminences about the place were intrenched and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Be&s;iegers. The <HI>Heyducks</HI> took their Po&s;t along the inner Wall of the lower Town, and &s;o the attacks were continued with the &s;ame vigour as before. The <HI>Bavarians</HI> rai&s;ed a Battery of nine Guns of 24 ball upon the Ron|del of the Ca&s;tle, wherewith they beat the Flanks and widened the Breach, but the Earth being very narrow and &s;treight, &s;o that but few could pa&s;s a bre&s;t, the Be&s;ieged might the better di&s;pute the acce&s;s of the A&s;&s;ailants.</P>
<P>The Scouts brought advice that the <HI>Grand Vi|&s;ier</HI> had effectively pa&s;&s;ed the Bridge of <HI>E&s;&s;eck,</HI> and that he had 20000 men with him, which with the Troops by <HI>Alba Regalis</HI> amounted to 40 or 50000, mo&s;t old Soldiers, taken out of their Garri&s;ons and Fortre&s;&s;es, into who&s;e places they had put their new Levies. There came al&s;o ad|vice, that the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Agria,</HI> having a&s;&s;embled &s;ome thou&s;ands of Turks out of the Garri&s;ons of upper <HI>Hungary,</HI> was advanced near <HI>Hatwan,</HI> where he had commanded a great many Charets out of the Neighbourhood, to carry Pontoons to the <HI>Danube</HI> &s;ide, by means wherof he pretended to put relief into the Town, at the &s;ame time that the <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier</HI> &s;hould attack the Lines on the other &s;ide. This adverti&s;ement obliged the Chri&s;tian Generals to u&s;e &s;uch nece&s;&s;ary precautions which might &s;ecure them on <HI>Pe&s;t</HI> &s;ide.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 5. In the <HI>Lorrain</HI> attack the approaches were advanced from the great Rondel towards the &s;econd Wall, where they had po&s;ted them|&s;elves in the a&s;&s;ault of the <HI>3d.</HI> in&s;tant. The Mi|ners were bu&s;ie at the right of the Breach, the better to attack the Enemy in flank, as al&s;o un|der the Curtain, to blow up the Be&s;ieged's Re|trenchments behind the Breach. A Gallery was begun on the right of the Battery, to go into the inward Ditch, and the better to a&s;&s;ure the attack the Flanks were palli&s;ado'd. The be&s;ieged &s;pent the whole Night in throwing of Bombs, Grana|do's, and Stones, to incommode the contrary Workmen, but without much harm, &s;ave the killing of 3 <HI>Heyducks,</HI> and wounding 5 or 6 other Soldiers. This afternoon one of their Bombs fal|ling into a Barrel of Powder upon the Be&s;iegers Battery, killed five, and hurt three.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 6. A new Battery of two Demy-Cannon was rai&s;ed in the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack behind the great Rondel, by means whereof the Defence of the little Rondel was ruined, which the be&s;ieged had hitherto u&s;ed with great advantage. The Chri|&s;tians continued to fill the inward Moat with Fa|gots, Tuns, Sacks with earth, and the like, and made a Redoubt behind the great battery to &s;e|cure the Workmen. The <HI>Brandenburgers</HI> and <HI>Ba|varians</HI> continued their attacks with vigour, no|thing el&s;e con&s;iderable intervening.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 7. La&s;t Night &s;everal fal&s;e alarms were given, as if the Turks were come to attempt &s;uc|couring the place. The Chri&s;tians continued to deepen the Ditch about their Lines, and to for|tifie their Po&s;ts to make the Enemy de&s;pair of forcing their Camp. The Mines were al&s;o carri|ed on with great indu&s;try, and would in 3 or 4 days be ready for execution. The <HI>Heyducks</HI> under|took to fill the Ditch of the &s;econd Wall in 48
<PB N="330" REF="162">hours time, upon the a&s;&s;urance of a recompence of 4000 livers, which was promi&s;ed them by the Generals. The breach which was made in the &s;e|cond Wall was very &s;pacious, and as &s;oon as the Mines were fini&s;ht, they will again a&s;&s;ault the &s;e|cond wall. They found much difficulty in the <HI>Ba|varian</HI> attack to render them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the Ca&s;tles, by rea&s;on of the various Walls and De|fences which were to be forced, and of the ob&s;ti|nacy of the Defendants. This obliged the Elector to redouble the fire of his Cannon to throw down the&s;e Walls, and in effect they did little el&s;e, be|&s;ides beating the Ca&s;tle from their &s;everal batte|ries, which plai'd upon the Flanks and Curtains with &s;o much fury, that they hop'd in a few days to &s;ee them quite down. Thirty <HI>Hu&s;&s;ars</HI> meeting with as many of the <HI>Turks,</HI> killed one of them, and took 4 Pri&s;oners, which they brought with them to the Camp. Among&s;t the&s;e was an <HI>Aga,</HI> who four years &s;ince was ran&s;omed out of <HI>Raab,</HI> where he had been Pri&s;oner, for 8000 Crowns. The&s;e reported that the <HI>6th</HI> in&s;tant the <HI>Sera&s;quier</HI> &s;hould arrive at <HI>Alb-Royal</HI> with 26000 Hor&s;e, and was to be followed by the <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier,</HI> who a&s;|&s;embled his Army about <HI>E&s;&s;eck,</HI> which was not to be inferiour in number to that which was la&s;t year imployed at the Siege of <HI>Gran.</HI> They added, that the Seraskier had expre&s;s Orders not to ha|zard a battel with the Chri&s;tians, for fear of lo|&s;ing the City and Army at once, but to endea|vour to put Supplies of Troops in the be&s;ieged Town one way or other, or to peri&s;h in the attempt.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 8. Four thou&s;and <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> and <HI>Tartarian</HI> Hor&s;e appeared upon a Hill near the <HI>Bavari|an</HI> quarter, and retired after &s;ome light Skirmi|&s;hes with Count <HI>Budiani</HI>'s <HI>Hu&s;&s;ars,</HI> reinforced by &s;ome commanded Men and Voluntiers. The Pri&s;oners taken there depo&s;ed, that the <HI>Seraskier</HI> was camped under the Cannon of <HI>Alba-Regalis</HI> with 20000 Combatants, and that the Grand Vi&s;ier with the Grand Army was expected there; but the Duke, by the report of his Spies and Scouts knew that the <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier</HI> was uncer|tain whether he ought to proceed with all the Army, or continue about the bridge of <HI>E&s;&s;eck,</HI> with a great part of his Forces, capable to oppo&s;e the <HI>Croats,</HI> which might ruine the &s;aid bridge, if he abandoned it, and &s;o cut off his retreat. The mines in the <HI>Lorrain</HI> attack would be ready in two days. The fortification of the Camp was conti|nued, as al&s;o the perpetual di&s;charge of the Cannon and Mortars again&s;t the be&s;ieged.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 9. Some thou&s;ands of <HI>Turks</HI> po&s;ted them|&s;elves not far from the Camp, in an advantage|ous place, as if they de&s;igned to prepare them|&s;elves there for &s;ome attempt; but the Generals had taken &s;uch good mea&s;ures, they apprehended nothing, and the Souldiers &s;eemed full of cou|rage. All the retrenchments about the Camp were near fini&s;hed, but being the <HI>Turks</HI> did frequently alarm them, the Duke ordered, that all the Foot that were not in the Approaches, &s;hould be placed in the Lines, and particularly in the Spurs. This morning, a Bomb from the Town falling unhap|pily into a re&s;erve of Granado's, fired them, kil|ling 3, and wounding 13. This evening &s;ome <HI>Turks</HI> did again appear upon an eminence to the right behind the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Camp, towards which two Squadrons of them did move in good order, to brave the Be&s;iegers, but &s;ome Voluntiers riding out to pickeer with them, they retired with the lo&s;s only of one man &s;lain.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 10. The Imperiali&s;ts continued the fini&s;h|ing of their Mine, the two others of the two other Attacks being ready. The Duke cau&s;ed the <HI>Hun|garian</HI> Foot to be po&s;ted along the Wall of the lower Town, from the Water Rondel to the very quarters of the <HI>Germans,</HI> where they intrenched them&s;elves with a Ditch and a good Parapet to &s;ecure them again&s;t &s;urpri&s;es; and as the <HI>Danube</HI> is deep there, they &s;unk two Barks full of &s;tones, and made &s;everal Spurs of Pali&s;ado's along the brink of the River, to take away all hopes of the <HI>Turks</HI> relieving of the Town that way. This morning the Infidels gave another alarm on the <HI>Bavarian</HI> quarters, whereupon all the Cavalry was commanded to Hor&s;e, but the Enemy retired at the &s;ame time. It &s;eems that their de&s;ign was to make a pa&s;&s;age that way, but the <HI>Bavarians</HI> were &s;ufficient|ly intrenched to hinder them. The Prince of <HI>Croy</HI> being recovered of his wounds, did rea&s;&s;ume the exerci&s;e of his charge in the approaches. Four <HI>Hu&s;&s;ars</HI> very well mounted, advancing again&s;t &s;ome <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Hor&s;e of the place, made as if they would charge them, but being come up with them they di&s;cour&s;ed them and &s;hook hands together, which being ob&s;erved by the Musketiers of a neighbouring Redoubt, they &s;allied out and gave fire upon the <HI>Hu&s;&s;&s;ars,</HI> who ran away, hurt one, which they took, as al&s;o another of them, the third got away, and the fourth entered into the City. The Pri&s;oners were examined, who &s;aid they did nothing but enquire of the <HI>Turks,</HI> if they would not yet &s;urrender the place, but they were to be interrogated more &s;trictly.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 11. Some <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Troops did again &s;hew them&s;elves upon the Mountains on the <HI>Bavarian</HI> &s;ide towards the way of <HI>Alb-Royal.</HI> The preci&s;e number of the <HI>Turks</HI> is not yet known, &s;ome Spies certifie that there are 40000 <HI>Ottomans,</HI> and 20000 <HI>Tartars.</HI> In the mean time every nece&s;&s;ary pre|vention is put in practice to receive them, if they will attempt to force the Camp. Preparations are made for a vigorous a&s;&s;ault upon the &s;econd wall, if the Mines will an&s;wer expectation.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 12. All things being ready for the a&s;&s;ault, the three Mines on the <HI>Lorrain</HI> attack were fired, which had no other &s;ucce&s;s than the turning up of a few Pali&s;ades, the Miners not having pierced deep enough under the Wall of the &s;econd Ram|part, which made it evident that they did not well under&s;tand their trade, although they had been &s;ent for from all quarters, to have good ones, for they were the Mines that contributed the mo&s;t to the reducing of this important place. The a&s;&s;ault that was de&s;igned if the Mines had taken, was deferred, and new ones were gone in hand with, in hopes of more favourable &s;ucce&s;s. In the skirmi&s;hes of this day, there was an Officer of the <HI>Turks</HI> killed, who doubtle&s;s had engaged him&s;elf to enter into the place, being they found Letters about him to the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Buda,</HI> marking the or|der the Turks were to ob&s;erve to relieve the be|&s;ieged; by which it appeared, that the Grand Vi|&s;ier's de&s;ign was to force a quarter, and &s;o put in a Supply into the place without hazarding a bat|tel; and that 8000 <HI>Tartars</HI> &s;hould hara&s;s the Coun|try as far as <HI>Gran,</HI> to cut off provi&s;ions from the Be&s;iegers, and infe&s;t them with continual cour&s;es. Upon this advice the Duke called a Council of War, where it was re&s;olved, to leave part of the Army in guard again&s;t the Town, and to march with the re&s;t of the Imperial and Auxiliary For|ces again&s;t the Enemy, who according to the &s;aid Letters were above 60000 &s;trong, although they had it from good hands, that they did not exceed 40000 Combatants.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 13. The whole Army marched out of the Lines the night pa&s;t, except 20000 left there for the Guard of the Works, and to hinder the Ene|my from putting Supplies into the Place. Oats and Forage were di&s;tributed for three days for the Hor&s;e, and the <HI>Volunteers</HI> were formed into a
<PB N="331" REF="162">fine Body under good Officers. The Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> po&s;ted him&s;elf out of the Camp in &s;ight of the Ene|mies, 4000 <HI>Hu&s;&s;ars</HI> and <HI>Heyducks</HI> having the Avant|guard. This night the <HI>Spies</HI> and &s;ome De&s;erters a&s;&s;ured them, that the following night they would be attacked in Battel-array upon break of day, which obliged the Chri&s;tians to di&s;po&s;e of all things for the Battel.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 14. The <HI>Turks</HI> before Sun-ri&s;ing formed a Bo|dy of more than 8000 <HI>Janizaries</HI> and <HI>Spahi's,</HI> the mo&s;t brave and mo&s;t re&s;olute of the Army, who being di|vided into divers Troops, marched from 6 in the Morning till 8 a clock, curvetting behind the Moun|tains on the &s;ide of <HI>Alba Regalis,</HI> and entered into a Plain the better to approach the Camp by the favour of a Valley. The Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> having ob&s;erved the Enemies countenance, commanded Count <HI>Dune|wald,</HI> General of the Hor&s;e, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ground to the left with nine Imperial Regiments, Cuira&s;iers, Dragoons, and Croats, to which he added &s;ome Companies of <HI>Hu&s;&s;ars;</HI> and General <HI>Heu&s;ler</HI> had order to po&s;t him&s;elf with his Detachment upon the height on the right. The <HI>Hu&s;&s;ars</HI> who were with Ge|neral <HI>Dunewald</HI> charg'd fir&s;t, and tho' they fought with all imaginable bravery, they were notwith&s;tanding forced to give way, but &s;eeing them&s;elves &s;upported by the <HI>Germans,</HI> they took heart and returned to the Charge again. The <HI>Turks</HI> &s;eeing they had routed the <HI>Hu&s;&s;ars,</HI> thought to have had the others as good cheap; upon the&s;e hopes, they advanced with great fury and horrible cries again&s;t the Chri&s;tians, who received them without moving. <HI>Heu&s;ler,</HI> who had placed him|&s;elf upon the height mentioned, charged them &s;mart|ly, &s;o that the fight was rude and bloudy, and how|ever the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;aw them&s;elves charged in their Flanks and Front, they did not de&s;i&s;t to make u&s;e of &s;everal efforts to break through the Enemy, and have room to execute their de&s;ign, but all was in vain, being eve|ry time repul&s;ed, until they were at length broke and forced to fly. The execution was bloudy. The Jani|zaries being abandoned by the <HI>Spahi's,</HI> and environ|ed by their Enemies, throwing away their Arms, &s;ought to &s;ave them&s;elves by flight, but were mo&s;t of them &s;lain. The <HI>Turks</HI> had above 3000 dead, mo&s;t of them Janizaries, all cho&s;en men, who had underta|ken to force a quarter, and enter into the City, or pe|ri&s;h. The <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier</HI> had promi&s;ed 20 Ducats to eve|ry one that &s;hould enter into the City, whereof he gave each undertaker 5 in hand: every one carried be&s;ides his ordinary arms 3 Hand-Granado's, a Mat|tock and Spade, to break the Retrenchments and fill the Ditches. The Pri&s;oners were 500, there being al&s;o taken 30 En&s;igns and Standards, 11 Pieces of Can|non, and 10 Waggons loaden with Ammunition. This great action co&s;t the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> but little, the &s;lain not exceeding 60, and the wounded but 33. After this fight the <HI>Turks</HI> made &s;everal movements, and drew up in a Plain which lookt towards the <HI>Bavari|an</HI> quarter, and keeping their Wings upon heights, they made meen as if they would come to a deci&s;ive battel, or relieve the Place with all their Forces. Hereupon a Council of War was called, where it was re&s;olved to follow the Enemy, which was done by the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> in the head of his Army, but the <HI>Turks</HI> apprehending an Engagement, retired. The Generals <HI>Dunewald</HI> and <HI>Heu&s;ler</HI> pur&s;ued them be|yond the Mountains, and the <HI>Hu&s;&s;ars</HI> had another skirmi&s;h with a great Party of <HI>Turks</HI> which &s;tayed behind to amu&s;e the Chri&s;tians, and favour the re|treat of their Army. The booty the Chri&s;tians got was con&s;iderable, for they had all the &s;poil of the Enemy, whereof there was not one that had not the 5 Duckets which the <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier</HI> had given him be|&s;ides his own moneys. The Be&s;ieged thinking they were already relieved, made great fire upon them that kept the Approaches, and &s;uppo&s;ed they might ruine &s;ome of the Enemies works, but in vain, for they were &s;o briskly received, that they lo&s;t the de|&s;ire of risking further. They however made a very furious &s;ally on the <HI>Bavarian</HI> attack, which was fatal to them, for they were not only repelled by the Re|giments of <HI>Baden</HI> and <HI>A&s;premont,</HI> but the retreat be|ing cut off, there was great &s;laughter made of them. The Turks being retired without coming to a deci|&s;ive battel, the Army returned into their Lines, and immediately di&s;patched young Count <HI>Pal&s;i</HI> to the <HI>Emperour</HI> with the news of this great advantage, and to lay 28 Colours and Standards at his feet, that were taken in the late engagement. The re&s;t, for &s;ome were taken in the pur&s;uit, were planted upon the great Rondel, to make the Be&s;ieged comprehend the defeat of tho&s;e Succours that they had expected with &s;o much impatience.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 15. The <HI>Germans</HI> and <HI>Hu&s;&s;ars</HI> &s;couting abroad brought &s;ome Pri&s;oners in, who all agreed in this, that the Grand Vi&s;ier notwith&s;tanding this check, would not de&s;i&s;t making other attempts to put relief into the Town, tho' with the hazard of his whole Army. And in effect, however he was retired, he did not cea&s;e to alarm the Camp every night. This Afternoon a &s;ignal was made to the Be&s;ieged for a Parley, to inform them by the Janizaries Pri&s;oners of the rout of their Succours; but whether they per|ceived this within or not, they an&s;wered by the fire of their great and &s;mall &s;hot.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 16. The works of the three Attacks were pur|&s;ued with vigour, and in the Morning the Be&s;ieged's Palizadoes and Defences of Wood upon the Breach were fired in the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack, and partly con&s;u|med by the Flames, notwith&s;tanding all the dili|gence of the Turks to extingui&s;h them. In this Acti|on they threw a prodigious quantity of Stones, Gra|nadoes, Sacks with Powder, and other combu&s;tible matters upon the A&s;&s;ailants, in&s;omuch that four of them who fired them were burnt, twelve Crowns a man being given to each of tho&s;e who engaged them&s;elves in this Service as a recompence, and yet they could not clear the way for an A&s;&s;ault, the Be|&s;ieged having taken their time in the Night to plant other Palizadoes and repair their Defences. In the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Attack, the Ca&s;tle and the great Tower were ince&s;&s;antly beaten, which were as it were overturn'd by the force of the Cannon.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 17. All things were ready for the A&s;&s;ault in the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack, but the Be&s;ieged having repaired their Defences, and planted double rows of Paliza|does behind tho&s;e that were burnt ye&s;terday, they were obliged to defer it. The Pri&s;oners that the <HI>Hu&s;|&s;ars</HI> brought to the Camp reported, that the Grand Vi&s;ier was extreamly in choler again&s;t the Com|mander of the <HI>Spahi's,</HI> for not having done his duty in the fight on the <HI>14th</HI> in&s;tant, by abandoning the <HI>Janizaries,</HI> and added, that of the ten thou&s;and men which were appointed for that enterpri&s;e, but very few returned to the Camp.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 18. The two great Mines in the <HI>Lorrain</HI> At|tack were fired, but neither with that Succe&s;s that the Miners had promi&s;ed, which extremely retarded the Reduction of this important Place. The Duke &s;eeing they advanced but little by Mining, re&s;olved on Sapping, for which end, preparation of Faggots and Sacks of Earth were made to fill the Ditch, and certain Engines were devi&s;ed to approach the Ene|mies with le&s;s peril, and drive them from their Po&s;t. A new Battery was rai&s;ed on the right to beat down the Be&s;iegeds flanks of Palizadoes on the Breach; and to do it more effectually they were to &s;hoot from the Battery on the Curtain with chained Bullets. A Fu|gitive from the Turki&s;h Army reported among&s;t other things, that the Grand Vi&s;ier was encamped at pre&s;ent at <HI>Ert&s;chin,</HI> 4 Leagues from the City, but that he would not de&s;i&s;t from attempting the relief of the Place, being only removed to that di&s;tance for want of Forrage. The <HI>Bavarians</HI> &s;eized a Country Fellow who had &s;wum the <HI>Danube,</HI> having Letters from the Governour to the Grand Vi&s;ier and the Aga of the <HI>Janizaries,</HI> in which he <HI>conjures them by the
<PB N="332" REF="163">Law of</HI> Mahomet <HI>to &s;uccour him, adding he would expect the la&s;t extremity.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 19. The Be&s;ieged defending them&s;elves with ob&s;tinate Valour, &s;pent this whole day in thundring with their Artillery upon the new <HI>Lorrain</HI> Battery, which had been rai&s;ed to beat upon the flanks of the Palizadoes, and whereon they had mounted 4 great Guns, which they &s;o ruined that it was rendred u&s;e|le&s;s for the pre&s;ent. The Detachments from the Grand Vi&s;iers Army continued to alarm the Chri|&s;tians Camp every Night, who to prevent Surpri|zes, were continually upon their Guard. General <HI>Scherfenberg</HI> was expected in few days with tho&s;e Troops he commanded in <HI>Tran&s;ilvania.</HI> As &s;oon as this body was arriv'd, they pretended to go and at|tack the Grand Vi&s;ier in his Camp, who by report of Pri&s;oners and Run-aways, did not exceed 46000 men, whereof half were new raw Fellows without Di&s;cipline or Order. Strong parties were every day &s;ent out to ob&s;erve the Enemies Countenance, who often &s;hock with theirs, but always with Advantage.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 20. The Grand Vi&s;ier re&s;olved to make ano|ther attempt to introduce Supplies into <HI>Buda,</HI> would do it with fewer Troops than before, the better to pa&s;s undi&s;cover'd, and be able to approach the Chri|&s;tian Camp. He cho&s;e for this purpo&s;e the brave&s;t Officers in his Army, who promi&s;ed to execute his order or peri&s;h. They began their march in the Night with 2000 <HI>Spahis,</HI> and the like number of <HI>Janizaries,</HI> who were mounted for the greater Ex|pedition, and this Morning at break of day they ap|pear'd in the Valley of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> where having been put in order without being perceived, ru&s;hed, as their manner is, with great Cryes upon the fir&s;t Guard, which they defeated ea&s;ie enough, and forced upon two &s;quadrons of Hor&s;e of <HI>Caprara</HI> and <HI>Heu&s;lers,</HI> who received them courageou&s;ly, giving others time to ha&s;ten to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and cha&s;e the Turks, who fled. The <HI>Janizaries,</HI> whereof part had quitted their Hor&s;es with de&s;ign to traver&s;e the Trenches, and get into the City, were ill treated, they were pur&s;ued by General <HI>Heu&s;ler</HI> to the very Gate, and met by the Guard of <HI>Bavarian</HI> Hor&s;e, who ha&s;tned to the allarm, &s;o that their &s;laughter was there very great, and few had the fortune to enter into the Ci|ty; and though &s;ome make them amount to 150, they were &s;carce 100 that got in, which may be ea&s;ily judged by the abandoned Hor&s;es, which did not &s;urpa&s;s the &s;aid number, &s;o that this feeble &s;up|ply was of no great u&s;e to the Be&s;ieged, and if tho&s;e of the advanced Guard had done their duty, not one of them had pa&s;&s;ed the Trenches. The Turks had 400 &s;lain, and the Chri&s;tians not above 15; and 26 hurt. General <HI>Heu&s;ler,</HI> who behaved him|&s;elf with his accu&s;tomed Gallantry, was hurt in the foot, but not dangerou&s;ly. General <HI>Maigret</HI> was handled wor&s;e, being &s;everely &s;abled, and Marquis <HI>Santini,</HI> a Knight of <HI>Malta,</HI> was taken Pri&s;oner in the fir&s;t heat of the fight. The Be&s;ieged, to te&s;tifie their Joy for the arrival of the&s;e Succours, flouri&s;hed three red Colours in token of Victory, and fired three <HI>Sal|vos</HI> with all their Artillery and &s;mall &s;hot, which gave the Be&s;iegers a gue&s;s at the &s;mallne&s;s of their number, which the Renegadoes yet affirm &s;urpa&s;s the number of 2000 &s;erviceable men. During the late &s;hock, &s;ome &s;quadrons of tho&s;e of the Grand Vi&s;ier, who had followed the other to &s;econd them, ap|pear'd in Battalia towards the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Attack, as if de&s;igning to try their fortune that way, but they re|tired without engaging: and yet they returned about ten at night to the &s;ame place they had attempted the pa&s;&s;age that morning, but they were repelled, and retreated in di&s;order. In the <HI>Bavarian</HI> attack there was a new Battery rai&s;ed of four Pieces: and the be&s;ieged mounted a great Gun upon the high wall of the <HI>Ca&s;tle,</HI> with which they beat all the covered way, as al&s;o the Battery of the <HI>Bavarians</HI> upon the great Rondel.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 21. Notwith&s;tanding the <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier</HI> cau&s;ed 5000 <HI>Tartars</HI> to pa&s;s the <HI>Danube,</HI> who ravag'd the other &s;ide of the River, and incommoded the adver&s;e For|ragers by their cour&s;es; All things are in abundance in the Camp, and the Convoys arrive there &s;ecurely by Water. General <HI>Scherfenberg</HI> is expected in 7 or 8 days with 10000 men, having orders to mount his Foot in Charets, for fear of tiring them with &s;o long a march. Twelve hundred <HI>Suedi&s;h</HI> Foot are likewi&s;e expected, being the remainder of the Troops which the <HI>King of Sweden</HI> is obliged to &s;end, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the <HI>Em|perour</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Infidels,</HI> upon account of his <HI>quota</HI> for tho&s;e Fiefs which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in <HI>Germany.</HI> This morning a Redoubt was built in that place which the <HI>Turks</HI> forced ye&s;terday; it was further fortified with two pieces of Cannon, and Troops capable to defend the pa&s;&s;age. There was al&s;o another Redoubt built on the Mountain on the left, where the Regi|ment of <HI>Lodron</HI> was camped. This day the Be&s;ieged did yet give &s;ome Volleys of rejoycing, whereof the rea&s;on is not known, unle&s;s it be &s;ome particular fea&s;t. The <HI>Sieur Rummel,</HI> General of the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Troops, being in the approaches, was &s;lain there with a Mu&s;|quet bullet. He is much regretted, having di&s;tingui|&s;hed him&s;elf in all the occa&s;ions where he might ac|quire glory.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 22. The Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> cau&s;ed the great Tower to be a&s;&s;aulted, which is in the middle of the Ca&s;tle, and for the mo&s;t part ruined by his Cannon. He took it with the lo&s;s of 73 Soldiers, and the like number wounded, among&s;t which, the Duke of <HI>Saxe-Mersburg</HI> was hurt in two places. Whil&s;t this a&s;|&s;ault la&s;ted, there was a fal&s;e alarm given on the <HI>Lor|rain</HI> &s;ide to divert the enemy, and much firing there was with Cannon to ruine the Defences which they had made upon the breaches of the inner Wall. This evening about 10 a clock, a Turk, who had &s;wum the River, was taken near the I&s;le of <HI>St. Margaret,</HI> he had thrown his Letters into the water, and yet confe&s;&s;ed that he had been &s;ent by the Ba&s;&s;a, to give advice to the Grand Seignior of the &s;tate of the place, and pre&s;s for relief: adding, that another was al&s;o gone with the &s;ame condition.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 23. The be&s;ieged made an attempt upon the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Attack, to recover the great Tower of the Ca&s;tle, which they had ye&s;terday lo&s;t by a&s;&s;ault, but they were repelled and beat back to their Retrench|ments. At the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack four pieces were plant|ed upon the great old Battery, wherewith they be|gan to batter the new Pali&s;ades upon the Breach of the inner Wall. The Night pa&s;t the Be&s;ieged &s;allied upon the <HI>Saxon</HI>'s quarter, but they were &s;o well recei|ved and repul&s;ed by Lieutenant Collonel <HI>Pletze,</HI> who was upon the Guard with 100 hor&s;e, that they had much to do to recover their &s;econd Wall, where this Officer was &s;lain with two Musket-&s;hot, and the <HI>Turks</HI> had yet the lei&s;ure to drag his Corps into the City.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 24. The <HI>Turks</HI> appeared in two &s;eparate Bo|dies, the one at the <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and the other at the <HI>Bava|rian</HI> attack, but without attempting any thing, and retired about noon into their Camp, which they had advanced a League nearer the Chri&s;tians than they were before. A Renegado out of Town reported, that the Be&s;ieged began to &s;peak with more licentiou&s;ne&s;s again&s;t the Ba&s;&s;a, who endeavoured to keep them to their duty, telling them, that the <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier</HI> expected one of the fir&s;t Mini&s;ters of State from the Port, with full power from the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> to treat and con|clude a Peace with the Generals of the Chri&s;tians, and that upon his arrival there would be a &s;u&s;pen&s;i|on of Arms; exhorting them not to degenerate from the bravery and vertue of true <HI>Mu&s;&s;elmen,</HI> who&s;e glo|ry they had hitherto &s;o generou&s;ly &s;upported, but to expect yet &s;ome few days before they talked of &s;ur|rendring.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 25. The Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> being adverti&s;ed, that the <HI>Turks</HI> might contrive a pa&s;&s;age on the <HI>Danube</HI> &s;ide, behind the hot Baths, to put Succours into the Town, ordered &s;ome Squadrons of Hor&s;e to &s;econd
<PB N="333" REF="163">the Guards, which were at the &s;ame time reinforced, and to the end the acce&s;s might be rendred the more difficult for the <HI>Turks,</HI> he cau&s;ed Pali&s;ado's to be plan|ted in the mo&s;t weak places, and cau&s;ed &s;ome Squa|drons and Battalions of <HI>Germans</HI> and <HI>Hungarians</HI> to be po&s;ted in &s;uch manner, that if the <HI>Turks</HI> would make &s;ome other attempt, they might ea&s;ily be tran&s;por|ted and ha&s;ten to the Alarm. Some change was al&s;o made in two Batteries, the better to incommode the Be&s;ieged, and de&s;troy their Parapets, Pali&s;ado's, and other defences which they had rais'd upon the breach of the inner Wall. In the <HI>Bavarian</HI> attack they got ground foot by foot, &s;o that they will in a little time be Ma&s;ters of all the Ca&s;tle, notwith&s;tanding the op|po&s;ition of the brave&s;t Enemy imaginable, who never lo&s;e an inch of ground without di&s;puting it, and endeavour to recover it by often repri&s;als, ma|king u&s;e for this purpo&s;e of Bombs, Granado's, Stones, Sacks with Powder, Stink-Pots, and other arts which courage and de&s;pair are capable of inventing to break the mea&s;ures of the Agre&s;&s;ors, and ob&s;truct their vio|lence; and as they have made divers holes and caverns under the places, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Chri&s;tians, by which they play the&s;e &s;orts of inventions, the other were con&s;trained to fill them with earth, &s;tones, and the very ruines of the Ca&s;tle, to damp and hinder their operation, without which they could not main|tain them&s;elves, but with great difficulty.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 26. The Pri&s;oners brought in the Camp by Parties, and the De&s;erters which ran away reported, that one of tho&s;e which was &s;ent to the <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier</HI> by the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Buda</HI> with Di&s;patches, in which he gave him an account of the &s;tate of the place, which he can no more defend at pre&s;ent, that the Ca&s;tle is well-nigh all in the hands of the Chri&s;tians, who on the fir&s;t a&s;&s;ault cannot fail to carry the place. That in the la&s;t a&s;&s;ault of the Ca&s;tle he had lo&s;t more than 100 of his be&s;t Soldiers, that the Recruits that were &s;ent him were but little con&s;iderable, not mounting to 200 men, among&s;t which, more than half were wounded, and con&s;equently un&s;erviceable. That for his part he had acquitted him&s;elf of his duty, by let|ting the Chri&s;tians &s;ee, that after a defence &s;o ob&s;ti|nate, during &s;o long a Siege, pu&s;hed on with &s;o much fury and bravery both on the one &s;ide and the other, that the <HI>Mu&s;&s;elmen</HI> knew well how to &s;upport the cau&s;e of their <HI>Sultan,</HI> in doing whereof he pretended to his &s;hare of glory, profe&s;&s;ing finally that the <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier</HI> ought to give an account of the ill &s;ucce&s;s of the Siege, and be re&s;pon&s;ible for a lo&s;s &s;o con&s;iderable, which he could not avoid, if the Imperiali&s;ts attem|pted another a&s;&s;ault, no more than the bloud of his valorous Soldiers, and his own, if he delayed their re|lief any longer. The Ba&s;&s;a did further mark the pla|ces in his Letter, which appear'd to him the mo&s;t pro|per to attempt the relief by, and if he took his mea|&s;ures well, that he would &s;ucceed in his enterpri&s;e. Upon this advice the Duke vi&s;ited in per&s;on the place marked to the <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier,</HI> and gave orders for every thing to hinder the introducing of &s;upplies. The Spies which were &s;ent to the Enemies Camp, reported, that the <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier</HI> had again promi&s;ed 40 Crowns a man to all them who would undertake to put them&s;elves into the place, promi&s;ing moreover that they &s;hould be exempt from the War during their lives, and en|joy their ordinary pay without the obligation of any &s;ervice. At noon advice was given that the <HI>Turks</HI> ad|vanced with 12 great pieces of Cannon, and a while after they were perceived in &s;ight of the Camp ran|ged in order of Battel, but as the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> di&s;|po&s;ed his Army to fight, they retired.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 27. The <HI>Lorrainers</HI> having fini&s;hed their work in form of a Bridg, it was extended to the adver&s;e Pa|li&s;ades to be made u&s;e of in the a&s;&s;ault. It was covered with earth to &s;ecure it from the fire, as had been done the day before in the <HI>Bavarian</HI> attack, which had obli|ged the &s;aid <HI>Bavarians</HI> to retire, but this morning they recovered their Po&s;t again, and to &s;ecure them from the fire, they made u&s;e of Planks covered with Tin, and yet when they thought them&s;elves &s;afe from this devouring Element, the Be&s;ieged, who want no indu|&s;try to their valour, threw towards evening an im|men&s;e quantity of artificial and combu&s;tible matters with that &s;ucce&s;s, that they pierced even to the &s;aid Planks, and reduced them to a&s;hes; they al&s;o flung &s;uch a va&s;t quantity of Granado's, Stones and Arrows upon the <HI>Bavarians,</HI> that they forced them to aban|don this Po&s;t with the lo&s;s of twenty Souldiers.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 28. In the <HI>Lorrain</HI> attack, they thundred with extreme violence from their Cannon upon the Flanks of the great Breach, as did al&s;o the <HI>Brandenburgers</HI> to overthrow the Be&s;ieged's defences. The <HI>Bavarians</HI> re|gained their Po&s;t, and covered them&s;elves &s;o well in it, that the Enemy would be much troubled to di&s;lodg them. Major <HI>Staben,</HI> who commanded the A&s;&s;ailants, was killed there, the &s;lain and wounded not otherwi&s;e exceeding 20. Upon the Report of &s;ome Renegado's that the <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier</HI> was re&s;olved to come this Night with all his Forces, the Duke ordered all things for his reception, and all the Army &s;tood in Battalia, but to no purpo&s;e, for no Enemy did appear.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 29. Being the Decollation of St. <HI>John Bapti&s;t,</HI> and a day which the <HI>Turks</HI> have always &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly ob&s;erv'd as fortunate to their Empire, 1000 <HI>Spahi's</HI> and 2000 <HI>Janizaries</HI> commanded by two Ba&s;&s;a's, and &s;econ|ded by 1500 <HI>Tartars,</HI> came at break of day to make an|other trial on the Water &s;ide, but &s;eeing the Po&s;t too well provided on that quarter, having received a di&s;|charge from the Musketeers that kept the Walls, they retreated, and judged it ea&s;ier to try the pa&s;&s;age by the &s;ame way that the la&s;t Supplies entred; they went by the Valley of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> and charged fiercely with their accu&s;tomed &s;houts upon the Regiments of <HI>Mer|cy, Heu&s;ler,</HI> and <HI>Newburg,</HI> who received them with &s;o much bravery, that they killed a great number of them, whereof &s;ome of the mo&s;t determined were ra&s;h enough to pu&s;h through to the very Lines, where they were all &s;lain except 4, who were lucky enough to get into the City. The number of the dead in this action amounted to 600, be&s;ides the Pri&s;oners, which were not many; and there were taken 25 Standards and Colours which were red, intimating thereby, that they would enter the City or peri&s;h. On the o|ther &s;ide &s;ome 30 were killed and wounded, <HI>Mercy</HI> was of the number of the la&s;t, but without danger, and his Adjoutant of the fir&s;t. During this Tentative the Be&s;ieged made a &s;ally upon the <HI>Bavarians,</HI> but the <HI>Heyducks</HI> attacking them in Flank, they had much a-do to retire, leaving 17 dead upon the place. The <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier</HI> &s;hewed him&s;elf with his Army all day on the <HI>Bavarian</HI> &s;ide, ready to engage, but &s;eeing 3 Regi|ments of Cuira&s;iers, and two of Dragoons, being the Avant-Guard of General <HI>Scherfenberg</HI>'s Army, he quickly retreated back to his Camp.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 30. <HI>Scherfenberg</HI> arrived this day with the re&s;t of his Body, proper men, who &s;eem'd eager to &s;igna|lize them&s;elvs. The De&s;erters reported, that the want was great in the <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier</HI>'s Army, and that the fami&s;hed Soldiers had plundered &s;ome Barks which had brought Provi&s;ions, the Officers not being able to hinder them.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 31. The <HI>Lorrainers</HI> took a new Po&s;t in the Ditch before the Breach in the inner Wall, but 3 fa|dom di&s;tant from the Palli&s;ade, and the place being very deep, the Turks could not much hurt them, where they had but 2 Soldiers wounded. This Mor|ning the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> went, accompanied with mo&s;t of the Generals, to the Elector's quarters, where they held a Council of War, and having dined there, the Duke returned to his Quarters, after which, the Works were ordered to be enlarged and deepned for the ea&s;ier a&s;cent to the A&s;&s;ault, which was re&s;olved upon in a day or two.</P>
<P><HI>Sept.</HI> 1. Three thou&s;and <HI>Turks</HI> appeared before day by Moon-light on the <HI>Bavarian</HI> &s;ide, but &s;eeing the Chri&s;tians in good order and ready to receive them,
<PB N="334" REF="164">they retired without any Engagement. The Great Chancellor, Count <HI>Straatman,</HI> being arrived ye&s;ter|day at the Camp with a &s;ecret Commi&s;&s;ion, called a Council of War, in which the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> and all the Imperial and Auxiliary Generals did meet. The Chancellor expo&s;ed his Com|mi&s;&s;ion, which contained his <HI>Imperial Maje&s;tie</HI>'s de&s;ires to put an end to this bloody Siege, and that they &s;hould con&s;ult on the means the mo&s;t proper and expedient for the terminating of it. Two points were chiefly de|liberated upon, whether they &s;hould go with the grea|te&s;t part of the Army, leaving a &s;ufficient number to guard the Lines, to force the <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier,</HI> or &s;hould make a General a&s;&s;ault upon the place, and that with more Forces than had hitherto been employed. The later was approved by mo&s;t of the Generals, and it was re&s;olved to a&s;&s;ault the place the next day, for which purpo&s;e every thing that was nece&s;&s;ary was prepared, that the enterpri&s;e might not fail: and le&s;t the Enemy might know it, it was given out, that they would the next day go and fight the <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier,</HI> which cau&s;ed great joy among&s;t the Officers and Souldiers, de&s;irous of &s;ignalizing them&s;elves. The Cannon of all the at|tacks were in the mean time imployed to inlarge the Breaches, and ca&s;t down the Enemies fences.</P>
<P><HI>Sept.</HI> 2. All the Generals mounted on Hor&s;eback, and the Troops put them&s;elves in order to quit the Lines, and go to their place of Arms, and march to|wards the <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier,</HI> making as if they would go and attack them in their Camp. The Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> vi&s;ited their Quarters, en|couragaing the Officers and Souldiers to maintain the cau&s;e of God, and the Glory of the Emperour. The Infantry was ranged into Battalions whil&s;t the firing in the three attacks was redoubled, and a va&s;t quantity of Bombs and chained Bullets were &s;hot again&s;t the be&s;iegeds defences, which were for the mo&s;t part thrown down; and as the Troops were put in order to march towards the <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier,</HI> the motion of the Vanguard was in&s;tantly changed, and at three in the Afternoon the Infantry that compo&s;ed the Rear-guard was commanded to mount to the a&s;|&s;ault, which was done in the three differing attacks of <HI>Lorrain, Brandenburg,</HI> and <HI>Bavaria,</HI> be&s;ides which there were two fal&s;e attacks to divert the Enemy. And however that all imaginary precautions were put in u&s;e to render the a&s;&s;ault ea&s;ie, they encountred &s;o brave a defence in the be&s;ieged, that they had much ado to &s;urmount them; they defended them&s;elves for three quarters of an hour with Halbirds, Half-Pikes, Partizans, and threw &s;uch a va&s;t number of Stones, Arrows, and Granades, that they repul&s;ed the A&s;&s;ailants more than once, until the Chri&s;tians, en|couraged by the pre&s;ence of their Generals, returning with greater force, rendred them&s;elves at length Ma|&s;ters of the Breach in all the three attacks. The <HI>Turks</HI> defended them&s;elves by retiring from Retrenchment to Retrenchment, &s;o that the &s;laughter was very bloo|dy; and to conclude, the be&s;ieged being beaten from all their fences, the A&s;&s;ailants entred by force into the City, ran thro' the &s;treets, killed all they met with, &s;paring neither Sex nor Age, &s;o that all was filled with the dead bodies of the&s;e Infidels. The <HI>Bavarians,</HI> in pur&s;uit of their point, attack'd 1000 <HI>Turks,</HI> who re|tired into a Redoubt at the foot of the Ca&s;tle, where they defended them&s;elves with extream Ob&s;tinacy, until de&s;pairing of their &s;afety, they hungout a white Flag, and demanded quarter; but as they had &s;lain many of the Aggre&s;&s;ors, and had re&s;i&s;ted two whole hours without &s;ubmitting, the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> were of Opinion they &s;hould have no quarter given them; but con&s;idering their number, that they might yet do much harm, that the Night was coming on, and that the Souldiers were wearied, and ought to re&s;t, that the <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier</HI> was not far off with a formidable Army, and that the fire was in &s;everal parts of the City, reducing all to A&s;hes; it was re&s;olved they &s;hould have their Lives given them; which being notified to them, they, mi&s;erable Bravos, threw down their Arms. There were about 1000 more, who being retired into Cellars and Ca|verns obtained the &s;ame grace. The number of the &s;lain amounted to 3000 be&s;ides the wounded, who were but few, &s;o that the Garri&s;on was &s;tronger than it had been reported by the fugitives to have been.</P>
<P><HI>Abdi</HI> Ba&s;&s;a died bravely in the Breach, where he fought valiantly with his Sable in his hand, without giving back or demanding quarter, not to degenerate from the glory and heroick Vertue of the antient <HI>Ot|tomans,</HI> nor fal&s;ifie the Oath which he made to the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> to pre&s;erve him the place, or to end his days gloriou&s;ly in it. The <HI>Vice</HI> Ba&s;&s;a is al&s;o an Officer of great reputation, he had defended the Ca&s;tle, and &s;eeing that all was lo&s;t, retired fighting into the al|ready mentioned Redoubt at the foot of the Ca&s;tle, where he thought to hold it out, and give the <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier</HI> lie&s;ure to come and relieve him; but &s;eeing that all was de&s;perate, he cho&s;e rather to implore the Cle|mency of the Conquerours, than &s;uffer him&s;elf and tho&s;e that were with him to be ma&s;&s;acred without any advantage to his party, and &s;o he was made a Pri&s;oner with tho&s;e with him, by the <HI>Bavarians.</HI> The <HI>Aga</HI> of the <HI>Janizaries,</HI> and &s;ome chief Officers fell to the Duke of <HI>Lorrains</HI> &s;hare, &s;o that the number of Pri|&s;oners did not exceed 2000, of 13000 brave expert Souldiers, and the very Nerves of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, which were in the place at the beginning of the Siege. The Chri&s;tians lo&s;s in this a&s;&s;ault was incon&s;iderable, not above 400 &s;lain, and half as many wounded, in which number were many Voluntiers, but few Offi|cers. Collonel <HI>Spinola,</HI> an Officer of good merit, was kil|led at the head of the A&s;&s;ailants, and Baron <HI>A&s;ti,</HI> who had been twice already hurt during the Siege, recei|ved now a third, which was feared would prove fatal.</P>
<P>The plunder which the Souldiers got was extra|ordinary, the riches of this City were va&s;tly great, which tho&s;e of the other Cities of <HI>Hungary</HI> under the domination of the <HI>Turks</HI> brought thither, as to a place of refuge and impregnable. There were found Am|munition and Provi&s;ions &s;ufficient for two Months longer. The Ar&s;enal was full of all &s;orts of offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive Arms to arm 30000 men, Harne&s;&s;es, Saddles, Boots, and other equipage for Hor&s;es, be&s;ides 400 pieces of Cannon and Mortars, whereof 170 were mounted, and no way prejudiced. It is impo&s;&s;ible to particularize every thing, it may &s;uffice to &s;ay, that a City could not be better furni&s;hed to &s;upport a Siege vigorou&s;ly than this was, nor defended by a more brave Garri&s;on. But if the oppo&s;ition hath been &s;ur|pri&s;ing, &s;o much greater is the glory of tho&s;e brave Officers, Voluntiers, and Souldiers that &s;ignalized them&s;elves there in the forcing of it.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> having put a &s;top to the &s;laughter, and ordered the Soldiers to return to their Colours, commanded the fire to be extingui&s;hed, gave the command of the place to Baron <HI>Beck,</HI> till the Em|peror's plea&s;ure was known, with a Garri&s;on of 5000 Foot and 1000 Hor&s;e. He farther commanded 10000 Hor&s;e and Dragoons with <HI>Badiani's Hu&s;&s;ars</HI> to pur&s;ue the <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier,</HI> who having &s;een the taking of <HI>Buda,</HI> di&s;camped in&s;tantly with all his Army, to go cover the re&s;t of the Turki&s;h Fortre&s;&s;es, put good Garri&s;ons into them, and &s;o &s;ecure the Bridge of <HI>E&s;&s;eck,</HI> where it was re&s;olved to go and attack him, if they could not overtake him, for which end the Infantry was imbar|ked upon the <HI>Danube</HI> for their ea&s;ier tran&s;port, whil&s;t the Cavalry marched by Land.</P>
<P>And thus this great and &s;trong City, after 145 years of Bondage under the Turki&s;h Yoak, was now at length, after having been &s;ix times be&s;ieged in vain, taken, and re&s;tored to the dominion of the Emperor. It had been of great &s;ervice to the <HI>Ottomans,</HI> as being their principal place of Arms, from whence they &s;ent their Forces and Munitions of War into the other Cities and Fortre&s;&s;es of their obedience, for they &s;till kept there a numerous Garri&s;on of 8 or 10000 Jani|zaries

<P>A Detachment, as we &s;aid, of 10000 Hor&s;e being &s;ent in pur&s;uit of the <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier</HI> by Land, and 12000 Foot, with 30 Cannon, Mortars, Ammunition, and all &s;ort of Provi&s;ions, were &s;ent down the <HI>Danube</HI> in large Boats, with order to fortifie them&s;elves in &s;ome convenient Po&s;t near the Bridge of <HI>E&s;&s;eck,</HI> whil&s;t or|ders were &s;ent to the Forces in <HI>Croatia</HI> to joyn them, in order to cut off the Enemies retreat. The main Army did al&s;o follow, but the want of Forrage in a wa&s;ted Country forced them to &s;eparate, and to pa&s;s the Ri|ver &s;ome 12 Miles below <HI>Buda,</HI> with de&s;ign to be&s;iege <HI>Segedin,</HI> whil&s;t the re&s;t continued their march to|wards <HI>E&s;&s;eck,</HI> and joyn with the <HI>Croatian</HI> Forces, a Party of which had in&s;ulted and burnt the Town of <HI>Quinque Eccle&s;iae,</HI> or five Churches, forcing the <HI>Turks</HI> into the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> having cau&s;ed a Bridge of Boats to be laid over the <HI>Danube</HI> at <HI>Paxi,</HI> &s;everal Par|ties of Hor&s;e were &s;ent out, who met with no Enemy, the Turks having abandoned the &s;mall places they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of on both &s;ides the River, after ha|ving removed their Cannon and &s;tore, and laid the&s;e places in a&s;hes. Count <HI>Caprara</HI> is de&s;igned to be&s;iege <HI>Se|gedin,</HI> but the de&s;ign upon the Bridge of <HI>E&s;&s;eck</HI> could not be executed at this time, the Countrey being &s;o extremely ruined, that the Troops were not able to &s;ub&s;i&s;t in their march thither. The <HI>Turks</HI> had like|wi&s;e abandoned <HI>Tuln</HI> and <HI>Hatwan,</HI> the Garri&s;on of the la&s;t being removed to <HI>Erlaw</HI> or <HI>Agria,</HI> after it had been mo&s;t mi&s;erably de&s;troyed. The Duke, upon fre&s;h ad|vice that the <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier</HI> had not pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Bridge of E&s;&s;eck</HI> as was reported, but had po&s;ted him&s;elf very &s;trongly and advantageou&s;ly on this &s;ide, with 20000 men, &s;eemed to alter his mind, and to go and beat up his Quarters, before he were further recruited from <HI>Belgrade.</HI> He had put 8000 of his be&s;t men into <HI>Alba Regalis,</HI> having given a Hor&s;e to every Janizary, the better to make excur&s;ions upon the Chri&s;tians in the Winter. Prince <HI>Lewis of Baden</HI> was detached from the main Army, with 12 Regiments of Hor&s;e and Foot, to go and be&s;iege <HI>Five-Churches,</HI> but the mea|&s;ures were &s;o taken, that he might joyn his Forces to the Duke's in ca&s;e it were requi&s;ite, or that the <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier</HI> might be brought to a battel. He was encamped near the Bridge of <HI>E&s;&s;eck,</HI> having the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Darda</HI> behind him the <HI>Danube</HI> on his right, and the Hills on his left, and his Front covered with the River <HI>Sarwitz,</HI> over which the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> had cau&s;ed Bridges to be laid, to oblige the <HI>Turks</HI> to repa&s;s the Bridge of <HI>E&s;&s;eck,</HI> or to &s;tand a Battel. But the &s;ea&s;on being too far advanced, he encamped at <HI>Tuln,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ing no farther, leaving part of the Army under <HI>Caprara,</HI> to pa&s;s the <HI>Danube</HI> in order to the Siege of <HI>Segedin,</HI> he returned towards <HI>Buda,</HI> and being encamped with 10 Regiments not far from <HI>Pe&s;t,</HI> &s;ent a Party to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of <HI>Hatwan,</HI> intirely ruined, tho' the <HI>Turks</HI> had left 17 Pieces of Cannon, which they wanted time and conveniencies to carry away. The re&s;idue of the Foot were put into <HI>Buda</HI> to reinfore that place, weakened by the departure of the <HI>Brandenburg</HI> and <HI>Saxon</HI> Troops, whil&s;t the Duke him&s;elf after &s;o glo|rious a Campain returned into <HI>Germany.</HI> The remain|ing Hor&s;e and Dragoons were &s;ent under General <HI>Veterani</HI> to reinforce the <HI>Imperial</HI> Forces before <HI>Segedin,</HI> upon advice that <HI>Achmet Ba&s;&s;a</HI> was marching with a Body of <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars</HI> to relieve it. General <HI>Wallis,</HI> who commanded the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts,</HI> hearing the Infidels advanced towards him, ordered Major General <HI>Ve|terani</HI> to march towards night with 7 Regiments of Hor&s;e, the <HI>Croats</HI> of <HI>Lodron,</HI> and the Dragoons of <HI>Ca|&s;telli</HI> and <HI>Magne,</HI> which they did, and at break of day &s;urpri&s;ing the <HI>Tartars,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 20. 1686.</NOTE> ea&s;ily routed them; nor did the <HI>Turks</HI> make any con&s;iderable re&s;i&s;tance, the &s;pirit of that People formerly &s;o martial, being actuated by &s;uch a current of misfortunes into de&s;pondency. The Chri&s;tians, being upon their return to their Camp with their &s;poil, were attacked by the <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier</HI> him&s;elf at the head of above 12000 <HI>Turks,</HI> but with equal &s;ucce&s;s, the&s;e being likewi&s;e utterly defeated, without any extraordinary combating. Twelve pie|ces of Cannon, and all their Baggage, with 3000 Hor|&s;es were taken. The &s;lain were e&s;timated above 2000. <HI>Segedin,</HI> &s;eeing their relief defeated, capitulated, be|ing admitted to march with what they could carry, except their Arms, to <HI>Teme&s;war.</HI></P>
<P>But the &s;trong Ca&s;tle of <HI>Five Churches</HI> had not &s;o good quarters.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. <HI>22.</HI></NOTE> They had quitted the Town upon the arrival of the Chri&s;tians, and retired into the Ca&s;tle, but after 4 days battery, &s;urrendred it at di&s;cretion, the Women only and Children being conducted to <HI>Valpo,</HI> whil&s;t the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a,</HI> 600 Janizaries, and 2000 others fit to bear arms, were made Pri&s;oners of War. The Prince of <HI>Baden,</HI> having put a good Garri&s;on into the place, divided his Army into two Bodies, one march|ed with General <HI>Scherffenberg</HI> towards <HI>Syclos,</HI> de&s;ign|ing, after having made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of that place, to march towards the Bridge of <HI>E&s;&s;eck.</HI> Nor did they of <HI>Syclos</HI> detend them&s;elves much better than the re&s;t, they only burnt the Town, not to keep the Ca&s;tle &s;carce to terms of di&s;cretion. The Prince marched thence to <HI>Darda,</HI> which he, although it were &s;trong, being &s;eated upon the <HI>Danube,</HI> and covering the Bridg on one &s;ide, found abandoned, the <HI>Turks</HI> being retired into <HI>E&s;&s;eck,</HI> leaving only a few Hor&s;e to ob&s;erve the Enemy, who, upon their advance, fled immediately. The Prince, having taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Darda,</HI> &s;ent Parties out to burn the Bridg of <HI>E&s;&s;eck</HI> with artificial fires, which they &s;o happily executed, notwith&s;tand|ing the Turks played upon them all the time with their Cannon from <HI>E&s;&s;eck,</HI> that they quite de&s;troyed the Bridge from <HI>Darda</HI> to the <HI>Drave,</HI> as likewi&s;e the Bridg of Boats which the <HI>Turks</HI> had over that River.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Baden,</HI> after this exploit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No. <HI>3.</HI></NOTE> marched back towards <HI>Cape&s;war,</HI> with 1200 Pri&s;oners of both Sexes and Ages, which place he purpo&s;ed to po&s;&s;e&s;s, and had delivered upon demand, after which he re|&s;olved for his Winter Quarters. The <HI>Croats</HI> al&s;o that had hitherto joyned him, did likewi&s;e return home with Booty, and &s;tore of Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>And this was the end of this famous Campain in <HI>Hungary,</HI> &s;o glorious to the <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> and &s;o unfor|tunate to the <HI>Ottomans,</HI> &s;o that the&s;e who u&s;ed to give and &s;ell Peace at plea&s;ure formerly, became now earne&s;t Sollicitors them&s;elves for it, thinking them|&s;elves in &s;uch a condition, that nothing but a &s;peedy Peace could re&s;tore them. The <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier,</HI> being &s;en|&s;ible of this, made &s;everal efforts to effectuate it. He had lately made Overtures to General <HI>Caraffa,</HI> who commanded the Imperial Forces in upper <HI>Hungary,</HI> but now Letters are &s;ent to Prince <HI>Herman of Baden,</HI> Pre&s;ident of the Council of War, telling him how de&s;irous the <HI>Port</HI> was of Peace, and with what ad|vantage to the Emperour it might be concluded in this Conjuncture; propo&s;ing further, that a Place might be appointed for Plenipotentiaries on both &s;ides to meet, and that Pa&s;&s;ports might be di&s;patch|ed for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>And 'tis no wonder the Turks were &s;o earne&s;t for Peace, having been &s;o un&s;ucce&s;sful in War, and the di&s;orders it produced.

There was al&s;o a great Reform made in the Seraglio, with a Retrenchment of the falaries and perqui&s;ites of the principal Officers of it. There was al&s;o an extraordinary Council held in the pre|&s;ence of the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> to con&s;ider of the way to put the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Forces, which are now extreamly broken, into a condition to oppo&s;e the further progre&s;s of the Chri&s;tian Arms.

The <HI>Sul|tana</HI> Queen gave 4000 Pur&s;es of 500 Crowns each, and the chief Officers of the <HI>Seraglio</HI> pre&s;ented great &s;ums. And yet all this cannot cure their fears, nor re|move the Plague, &s;weeping away 1000 a day in <HI>Con|&s;tantinople</HI> and <HI>Galata,</HI> to which Calamities the &s;carci|ty of Provi&s;ions may be added, occa&s;ioned by the <HI>Co&s;|&s;acks</HI> di&s;turbing the Commerce of the black Sea, and the Chri&s;tians that of the <HI>Alexandria</HI> and the Arches.</P>
<P>Nor was it with the&s;e hard&s;hips only that the <HI>Turks</HI> were to contend, they had yet no le&s;s powerful Ene|mies, the <HI>Poles</HI> and the <HI>Venetians,</HI> who&s;e Hi&s;tories we have for method &s;ake referred to their proper Cla&s;|&s;es.

<P>The King being come to the frontier of <HI>Moldavia,</HI> expected that the <HI>Ho&s;podars</HI> of that Country and <HI>Wa|lachia</HI> &s;hould,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>July</HI> 24.</NOTE> as they had promi&s;ed, joyn their Forces to the Army of the Crown, which they were inclin'd enough to do, but that they dreaded the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Pow|er.

The King being come as far as <HI>Pererit</HI> in <HI>Moldavia,</HI> cau&s;ed a Royal Fort to be built on the &s;ide of the River <HI>Prutti,</HI> to &s;ecure a Retreat, and the pa&s;&s;age of Convoy, for it was very difficult to &s;ub|&s;i&s;t in tho&s;e harra&s;&s;ed Countries, which the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars</HI> had near ruin'd. Whil&s;t the Army was upon its march, the <HI>Ho&s;podar</HI> &s;ent Deputies to the King to excu&s;e his retiring from <HI>Ja&s;&s;i,</HI> and his not joyning Forces with tho&s;e of his Maje&s;ty, &s;eeing he could not now openly declare without expo&s;ing his Children to certain de&s;truction, having been forc'd to deliver them as Ho&s;tages to the <HI>Turks.</HI> The King replyed, that he could never meet with a more favourable conjun|cture to &s;hake off the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Yoak than now,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Aug.</HI> 8.</NOTE> being he was come in Per&s;on to deliver him from it; he ex|pected now the performance of his reiterated Promi|&s;es, which if he did not make good, he &s;hould be ne|ce&s;&s;itated to treat him as a declared Enemy. The King continuing his march, came to <HI>Ja&s;&s;i,</HI> which he found not only abandoned by the Prince, but al&s;o the Garri|&s;on and principal Inhabitants.

<P>Some <HI>Tartars</HI> taken by a party, reported, that the <HI>Seraskier</HI> had pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Danube</HI> near <HI>Axiopolis,</HI> with 15 or 16000 men, that he expected 6000 more, which when come up, he intended to march towards <HI>Be&s;&s;a|rabia</HI> to joyn the <HI>Tartars</HI> commanded by Sultan <HI>Nura|den,</HI> reported to be 30000 &s;trong. The Armies ap|proaching each other occa&s;ioned many encounters. The King continued his march on this &s;ide the Ri|ver <HI>Prutti</HI> as far as <HI>Falfyn.</HI> The Court Mar&s;hal, who commanded the Vauntguard of the Army, encoun|tring with a party of <HI>Tartars</HI> of 8000, engaged them, both fighting with great Courage, but the <HI>Tartars</HI> be|ing &s;tronger, pre&s;&s;ed hard upon the <HI>Poles,</HI> and had wor&s;ted them if they had not been &s;uccour'd by &s;ome fre&s;h Troops, who adding new Vigour to their Com|panions, turned the Scales, forcing the <HI>Tartars</HI> to a di&s;|orderly retreat, &s;ome hundreds of them were killed, and among&s;t others a near Relation of Sultan <HI>Nura|dons,</HI> for who&s;e body he offered the liberty of 3 <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Genlemen; &s;ome Pri&s;oners were likewi&s;e taken, and one of the <HI>Chams</HI> Standards, nor was this &s;ucce&s;s blood|le&s;s, divers of the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Officers and Souldiers being killed and wounded.</P>
<P>The King having cau&s;ed a Bridge near that Place to be laid over the River, pa&s;&s;ed it with his Army, ad|vancing into a great Plain with a Re&s;olution to enter into the Country of <HI>Budriac.</HI> But the Troops &s;uffer'd much by exce&s;&s;ive heat, which had cau&s;ed a great drought, and burnt up all the Gra&s;s, &s;o that the Hor|&s;es were in great want of forrage. <HI>Chevalier Lubormi&s;|ki</HI> had likewi&s;e an advantageous on &s;et again&s;t the <HI>Tar|tars,</HI> but the News of the <HI>Moldavians</HI> having contrary to their promi&s;e joyned the <HI>Tartars,</HI> did not plea&s;e.

<P><HI>Octob.</HI> 4. The <HI>Poles</HI> obtained a Victory again&s;t the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars,</HI> of whom &s;ome thou&s;ands were &s;aid to be killed upon the place, and 300 taken, with &s;everal of their principal Officers, for which &s;ucce&s;s <HI>Te Deum</HI> was &s;ung at <HI>Lemberg.</HI> The <HI>Poles</HI> al&s;o had 1500 &s;lain, and among&s;t them divers Per&s;ons of Qua|lity. After this, the King, weary of <HI>Moldavia,</HI> mo&s;t commonly fatal to the <HI>Poles,</HI> repa&s;&s;ed the Forre&s;t of <HI>Buckovina,</HI> in order to put his Troops into Winter-Quarters. He had not only quitted <HI>Ja&s;&s;i,</HI> which had been in part de&s;troyed by an accidental fire, but had al&s;o cau&s;ed the &s;everal Forts which he had built to &s;e|cure the Pa&s;&s;ages of the Forre&s;t to be demoli&s;hed; from whence People concluded, that the King had no de&s;ign to return in ha&s;te that way again, but ra|ther attempt <HI>Caminiec,</HI> &s;o ruinous to that &s;ide of his Kingdom, and into which the <HI>Turks</HI> had newly put 500 Waggons laden with Provi&s;ions, the Detach|ment of Hor&s;e that was &s;ent to ob&s;truct their Pa&s;&s;age coming too late.

<P>The <HI>Poles</HI> had been highly animated with the League Offen&s;ive and Defen&s;ive which they had made the beginning of this la&s;t Campaign with the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> which, though it had been publi&s;hed with great &s;olemnity on both &s;ides, the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> have not yet performed any one thing that was &s;tipulated on their &s;ide. The Great Dukes were obliged by this Treaty to employ their Forces this la&s;t Summer again&s;t the <HI>Tartars,</HI> to divert them from joyning with the <HI>Turks;</HI> nor did they advance a &s;tep in it, though they now (the Campaign being pa&s;t) &s;end Amba&s;&s;a|dors to a&s;&s;ure the King of their firm Re&s;olution to ob&s;erve the Treaty of Confederacy &s;o lately conclu+ded at <HI>Mo&s;cho,</HI> and yet they &s;tart new points which do &s;o far perplex the Court, that they begin to have a great Jealou&s;ie that the <HI>Czars</HI> do not &s;eriou&s;ly mean to enter into the War.</P>
<P>Great were the Preparations the <HI>Venetians</HI> had made to carry on the War this Summer again&s;t the <HI>Ottomans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Wars of <HI>Ve|nice.

They now batter it with &s;ix great Guns, and had lain 10 days before it when the Army of the <HI>Venetians</HI> ha&s;tning to its relief landed at <HI>Porto Vitulo,</HI> not far from it, and &s;ending a Detachment of 3000 Men, with 2000 Maynotes, the Garri&s;on which con&s;i&s;ted of 1200 having orders at the &s;ame time to &s;ally in their favour; the Enemy, intimidated with the report of their advance, rai&s;ed the Siege and marched &s;ilently away in the Night, yet not &s;o, but that being pur&s;ued by the Chri&s;tians, they left their Cannon behind them, the 500 men that conducted them being al&s;o mo&s;t &s;lain and taken Pri&s;oners. After this Defeat General <HI>Moro&s;ini</HI> rein|barked his Forces at <HI>Porto Vitulo,</HI> and &s;ailed towards the Gulf of <HI>Calamata,</HI> and thence to <HI>Porto Clinno,</HI> where he was to joyn with General <HI>Koning&s;mark,</HI> Comman|der of the Land Forces, lately arrived there with a great Convoy that went from <HI>Venice.</HI> They had ex|pected the arrival of the Auxiliary Gallies to open the Campaign, which being at length come, and a review of the Forces taken by General <HI>Moro&s;ini,</HI> which were e&s;timated at 25000 men, they &s;ailed the 25 of <HI>May</HI> from <HI>Porto Trepana</HI> with a fleet of above 100 &s;ail, con&s;i&s;ting in 80 Ships, 14 Galea&s;&s;es, and &s;everal Gallies and Galliots, taking their cour&s;e towards <HI>Le|panto,</HI> feigning a de&s;ign to attack that Fortre&s;s, near which the General cau&s;ed 1000 men to be landed to allarm the Country, and leaving &s;ome Ships there to countenance the feint, &s;ailed the Night following towards <HI>Modon,</HI> then ill manned, the Turks having drawn mo&s;t of their Forces towards <HI>Lepanto.</HI> But the Captain General thought fit to attack old <HI>Navarin,</HI> the <HI>Pylus</HI> of <HI>Ptolomy</HI> fir&s;t, which he did, 12000 foot, and 1500 Hor&s;e being landed for that purpo&s;e. This Town is built upon a height, at the foot whereof the Haven is capable of any number of Ships. The Gar|ri&s;on of this place was weak, not exceeding 200, &s;o that affrighted with the Fleet, the numbers, and the &s;ummons of the Chri&s;tians, they immediately &s;urren|dred, capitulating to march out with their Arms and Baggage, which they did, leaving behind them 20 pieces of Bra&s;s Cannon, 23 of Iron, and 7 Mortars, be|&s;ides 200 Chri&s;tian &s;laves, who obtained their liberty.</P>
<P>Count <HI>Coning&s;mark</HI> marched from thence to New <HI>Navarino,</HI> &s;eated on a Rock, and of very difficult ac|ce&s;s. He circled it by Land as well as the place would permit, whil&s;t it was beaten from Sea with 20 pieces of Cannon and 18 Mortas. The <HI>Seraskier</HI> of <HI>Morea,</HI> being &s;ollicitous for this place, advanced with 10000 men for its relief, de&s;troying all the Countries as he pa&s;&s;ed. The Chri&s;tians, to prevent his advance, lea|ving a body of men behind them to maintain the Works, marched to meet him, and endeavoured &s;e|veral times to engage him to a Battel, which he avoided by pa&s;&s;ing a River, and retiring to a very advantageous Ground. Count <HI>Koning&s;mark</HI> being re|inforced thereupon to 14000, it was re&s;olved they &s;hould pa&s;s the River in two Places, and charge the Turks in Front and Flank, which was performed accordingly. The Victory was ob&s;tinately conte&s;t|ed for at lea&s;t two hours, but then the Turks being di&s;ordered fled, leaving 1000 of their men &s;lain, wounded, and Pri&s;oners, with all their Tents, Can|non, and Baggage. The Chri&s;tians had &s;carce 100 killed and wounded. Triumphing with this Victo|ry they returned to the Siege, where, upon a &s;econd &s;ummons, the Be&s;ieged &s;eeing their hopes of Suc|cour defeated, and their Ba&s;&s;a &s;lain, being blown up,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June <HI>17.</HI> Nava|rino <HI>&s;urren|dred.</HI></NOTE> with 150 of the Garri&s;on by a Bomb falling among&s;t Powder, they likewi&s;e being 1200 Foot, and 200 Hor&s;e, &s;urrendred upon Conditions to march away with their Arms, Bag, and Baggage, which they did, leaving behind them 64 pieces of Cannon, and thirteen Mortars, with great &s;tore of Provi&s;ions.</P>

After the taking of <HI>Napoli,</HI> above &s;ixty &s;mall Towns and Burghs put them&s;elves under the pro|tection of the <HI>Venetians;</HI> and the General having &s;et|led affairs there, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the Auxiliary Gallies with their &s;hares of the Booty to return home, failed him&s;elf with the Gallies of <HI>Venice</HI> towards the <HI>Archi|pelag</HI> to put tho&s;e I&s;lands, which he al&s;o in a great mea&s;ure did, under contribution. The Garri&s;on and Inhabitants of <HI>Napoli</HI> being numerous, exceeding 10000, be&s;ides the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Greeks</HI> who were made Tributaries, were by Articles to be tran&s;ported to the I&s;le of <HI>Tenedos,</HI> which was al&s;o done in 12 Ships, commanded by Seignior <HI>Venier.</HI> This Fleet did not only alarm tho&s;e parts, but <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> it &s;elf, af|frighted with the report of a <HI>Venetian</HI> Armada &s;o near the <HI>Dardanels:</HI> But upon their return they were met, and fought by the Captain Ba&s;&s;a, who had 20 Gallies and 10 Ships, but &s;eeing he could do no good upon them, was obliged to quit the fight. The Se|raskier, in the mean time, was retired to <HI>Corinth,</HI> from whence he &s;ent &s;ome Troops to reinforce the Garri&s;on of <HI>Petra&s;&s;a,</HI> and very &s;trong Parties, who by their incur&s;ions, keep the <HI>Greeks</HI> in continual alarms, and hinder them from openly declaring for the <HI>Re|publick.</HI> To this end, he hath &s;eized upon divers of the Principal of them, keeping them as Ho&s;tages, but exerci&s;es all kinds of cruelty again&s;t &s;uch as he &s;u&s;pects to have any corre&s;pondence with the Chri|&s;tians.</P>
<P><HI>Cara Ibrahim,</HI> the late Vi&s;ier, being &s;tript of his E|&s;tate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. <HI>18.</HI></NOTE> was &s;ent to <HI>Rhodes,</HI> where, within the compa&s;s of the year, he was &s;trangled, by command of the <HI>Sultan,</HI> the <HI>Caimacan</HI> of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> being at the &s;ame time put into the &s;even Towers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Apr. <HI>28.</HI></NOTE> to &s;atisfie the People.</P>
<P>Nor was the <HI>Venetian</HI> War confined only to <HI>Mo|rea,</HI> and the <HI>Sea,</HI> though nothing extraordinary hap|pened in the later, that wi&s;e <HI>Republick</HI> having &s;ent <HI>Cornaro</HI> to command in <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> with &s;uch Forces as might endeavour to divert the <HI>Turks</HI> from &s;ending Succours either to <HI>Hungary</HI> or <HI>Morea,</HI> which they al&s;o in &s;ome mea&s;ure did. And yet &s;carce any thing worthy a place in Hi&s;tory, which is only plea&s;ed with great events, did intervene, the Forces indeed of neither &s;ide being &s;ufficient for great underta|kings. Some incon&s;iderable Places were intercepted on both &s;ides, and the incur&s;ions of Parties into each others Quarters were frequent; wherein the <HI>Mor|laques,</HI> like the <HI>Tartars</HI> on the Frontiers of <HI>Poland,</HI> did &s;ignalize them&s;elves. The Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Scutari</HI> had drawn together 7 or 8000 Men, with a Re&s;olution to at|tack the City of <HI>Budna,</HI> but they were ordered to march towards <HI>Hungary,</HI> &s;o that that de&s;ign vani&s;hed. But General <HI>Cornaro,</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Parma,</HI> who was Lieutenant General of the Foot, having drawn together 1000 Hor&s;e, and 3000 Foot, and 5000 <HI>Mor|laques,</HI> commanded by the Chevalier <HI>Janco,</HI> with the Artillery and Ammunition nece&s;&s;ary for a Siege, re|&s;olved to attack <HI>Sign,</HI> &s;cituated upon a Rock,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. <HI>23.</HI></NOTE> and for|tified with a good Wall and &s;trong Ca&s;tle, but the Cannon opening a Breach, it was a&s;&s;aulted and car|ried by force, the Garri&s;on which con&s;i&s;ted but of 250 <HI>Turks,</HI> being cut in pieces. By taking of this place, the <HI>Venetians</HI> are become Ma&s;ters of the fer|tile Province of <HI>Zettina.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier,</HI> upon his repa&s;&s;ing the Bridge of <HI>E&s;&s;eck,</HI> had &s;ent home the Troops of <HI>Bo&s;&s;ina,</HI> &s;o that the Ba&s;&s;a of the &s;aid Province, thinking him&s;elf with this reinforcement, in a condition to make &s;ome attempt upon the Enemy, was accordingly prepa|ring for it, tho' watched narrowly by <HI>Cornaro.</HI> The Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Erzegovina</HI> had likewi&s;e got a competent Army together, and having burnt &s;ome Villages, retired towards <HI>Clin,</HI> to put a Convoy of Provi&s;ions into that place, <HI>Cornaro</HI> at the &s;ame time having ta|ken his march towards <HI>Zsbenico</HI> and <HI>Sardona,</HI> to cover tho&s;e places. And thus this year, and the Campain, were fini&s;hed, except the u&s;ual excur&s;ions, both here, in <HI>Morea,</HI> in <HI>Poland,</HI> and in <HI>Hungary,</HI> where the Par|ties are always bu&s;ie, and infe&s;t each other accord|ing to their power.</P>
<P>The de&s;ires of the <HI>Port</HI> for Peace were great. It was again&s;t their Maxims to wage War with &s;o ma|ny powerful Adver&s;aries at once, nor could they tell how to extricate them&s;elves out of it. They had of|ten attempted &s;eparate Treaties, but the Allies were not to be disjoyned, they therefore offer'd them Conce&s;&s;ions they dur&s;t not have hoped for at the beginning of the War. They would yield to the Emperor all <HI>Hungary,</HI> as far as the <HI>Drave,</HI> to the King of <HI>Poland, Caminiec</HI> and all <HI>Podolia,</HI> and re&s;tore to the <HI>Venetians</HI> the Kingdom of <HI>Candia,</HI> on condition they would part with what they had gained in <HI>Morea.</HI></P>
