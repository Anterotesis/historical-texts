<HEAD>REASONS For Settling the Admiralty-Juri&s;diction, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THere is nothing can conduce more to the Peopling and enriching a Kingdom, or Common-wealth, than a free and open Trade; and as that by Sea is the princi|pal &s;ource of &s;uch Happine&s;s, it may very well de&s;erve the Governments mo&s;t particular Care and Application to ad|vance it.</P>
<P>And &s;ince this is no other way to be done, but by enabling the King to &s;et forth Fleets for the Merchants Security abroad, and e&s;tabli&s;hing good Laws for defending them in their Rights and Properties at Home, it is mo&s;t humbly propo&s;ed, Whe|ther this may not be effected with the greate&s;t Ea&s;e and Ad|vantage, by re-&s;etling the Admiralty Juri&s;diction, and re&s;tor|ing the ancient Power of enrolling Mariners.</P>
<P>U&s;age and Experience were always accounted very good Directors; and therefore, the better to accompli&s;h this De|&s;ign, it may not be improper, in the fir&s;t place, to give a &s;hort Account of the Methods ob&s;erved by our Ance&s;tors, in who&s;e times, our Sea-dominion was at the greate&s;t height, and Trade in as flouri&s;hing condition as tho&s;e Ages would admit: and in the next place, to con&s;ider of the be&s;t means to improve the&s;e Methods, and adapt them to the pre&s;ent Times.</P>
<P>The Sea-coa&s;ts of <HI>England</HI> were anciently divided into &s;e|veral Vice-Admiralties, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. <HI>Northumberland, Durham</HI> and <HI>York.</HI> 2. <HI>Lincoln.</HI> 3. <HI>Norfolk.</HI> 4. <HI>Suffolk.</HI> 5. <HI>E&s;&s;ex.</HI> 6. <HI>Kent.</HI> 7. <HI>Su&s;&s;ex.</HI> 8. <HI>Southampton.</HI> 9. <HI>Dor&s;et.</HI> 10. <HI>Devon.</HI> 11. <HI>South-Cornwall.</HI> 12. <HI>North-Cornwal.</HI> 13. <HI>Somer&s;et.</HI> 14. <HI>Gloce&s;ter.</HI> 15. <HI>South-Wales.</HI> 16. <HI>North-Wales.</HI> 17. <HI>Che&s;ter.</HI> 18. <HI>Lanca&s;ter.</HI> 19. <HI>Westmorland</HI> and <HI>Cumberland.</HI></P>
<P>Each of the&s;e places (the Port of <HI>London</HI> being immediately under the Admiralty Court, as to this matter) had a particu|lar Vice-Admiral, who had Power to hold a Se&s;&s;ions once in the Year, or oftner, if occa&s;ion required, and to call before
<PB N="2" REF="3">him, or his Officer, all Sea-faring Men and Mariners, living within his Di&s;trict or Divi&s;ion, and then, and there to enrol all their Names and Places of abode, taking Account likewi&s;e, of all Ships within their Juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>This was the Method u&s;ed &s;everal hundreds of years &s;ince, as appears by certain Maritime Laws and Ordinances, Regi|&s;tred in the ancient Authentick <HI>Black Book</HI> of the Admiralty; four Articles of which, are as followeth:</P>
<P N="1">1.

<P>If the Sea-faring Men were not obedient to the Vice-Admiral's &s;ummons and orders made according to the Ma|ritime Laws, they had a coercive power &s;ufficient to oblige them to be enrolled, and to go into the King's &s;ervice whenever occa&s;ion required.</P>
<P>This method of rai&s;ing Sea Men was continued in good order down to the end of the pro&s;perous Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> from which time it began to be neglected, and &s;o dwindled by degrees, till at la&s;t the u&s;e and practice of it quite vani&s;hed, in&s;omuch, that at this day the very re|membrance of it is almo&s;t lo&s;t; and 'tis not at all &s;trange that it &s;hould be &s;o, if we con&s;ider the temper of King <HI>James</HI> the fir&s;t, the circum&s;tances of King <HI>Charles</HI> the fir&s;t, the late troubles, the remi&s;ne&s;s of the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the &s;econd, and the de&s;igns of the late King.</P>
<P>During the two la&s;t Reigns, who would not think but the de&s;ign was to transfer the Soveraignty of the Seas, and trade of the World to <HI>France,</HI> &s;ince &s;uch Indu&s;try was u&s;ed by the Kings them&s;elves, not only to in&s;truct the French King in the building Ships of War, and &s;etting out Fleets, but al&s;o in the giving him a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the compiling of his Sea-laws, &s;et forth in the Ordinances of that King in the year 1681 The French had from hence al&s;o the fir&s;t foot|&s;teps of their exqui&s;ite method of enrolling Mariners. And if it &s;hall be thought fit for the Kingdoms &s;ervice, or in any mea&s;ure conducing to our Happine&s;s, why &s;hall we not follow likewi&s;e the more glorious Example of our pre&s;ent King, in endeavouring to retrieve it? We have certainly the greate&s;t motives that ever Engli&s;h Men had, to excite every one in his re&s;pective &s;tation, to give his Maje&s;ty tho&s;e hearty a&s;&s;i&s;tances as may under the ble&s;&s;ing of God regain the betray'd honour of the Nation, and &s;ettle the Peace, Plenty, and Glory thereof, for which, next to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of our Religion, our Royal Leader hath hazard|ed
<PB N="4" REF="4">more than ever any of our Kings did before him.</P>
<P>And therefore &s;ince a ready way of rai&s;ing a &s;ufficient number of Seamen to Man the Fleet, is of the greate&s;t concern in this affair, and the encouraging of them volun|tarily to enter into their Maje&s;ties &s;ervice, is of no le&s;s im|portance, it is humbly propo&s;ed whether this may not be done mo&s;t effectually by emproving the ancient Methods of pre&s;&s;ing Seamen with a Bill in Parliament, to this pur|po&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. That &s;uch Sea-men as &s;hall voluntarily enrol them&s;elves in the Admiralties or Vice-Admiralties, may be exempt from petty Offices in the Pari&s;hes where they live, and al|&s;o from the payment of Pari&s;h-duties, Taxes and the like, during their lives, or &s;o long as they &s;hall continue en|rolled.</P>
<P N="2">2. That all Prizes be divided into three parts, one third to the Captor, and his Ships-Crew, another to go to the Che&s;t at <HI>Chatham,</HI> towards a Provi&s;ion for &s;ick and wound|ed Mariners, and the Widows and Children of &s;uch as are &s;lain; the remaining third to pay the charge of Prize-Officers.</P>
<P N="3">3. That the Act of Parliament 43. <HI>Eliz.</HI> 3. concerning the relief of Soldiers and Mariners be amended, and the Mony collected by vertue thereof, tran&s;mitted to the <HI>Chath|am Chest</HI> for the u&s;es afore&s;aid: That Mony amounts to a|bout 14000 <HI>per ann.</HI> and may with care be made as much more if it &s;hall be found requi&s;ite, and as it is now ordered is of little or no u&s;e to the Government.</P>
<P N="4">4. If it may con&s;i&s;t with their Maje&s;ties affairs that the wages of Captains, Officers and Seamen be a little advanced, they being not &s;o good (con&s;idering the pre&s;ent value of Mo|ny) as they were formerly.</P>
<P N="5">5. That &s;uch Mariners as &s;hall not voluntaily enrol them|&s;elves or appear upon the Vice-Admirals Summons, or &s;tand out till they are pre&s;&s;ed, &s;hall not have the benefit of the a|fore&s;aid Priviledges and Exemptions.</P>
<P N="6">6. That no Captains, Commanders, or Seamen remain in Foreign Service in time of War, without Licen&s;e, and that they return upon their Maje&s;ties Proclamation, under &s;uch a penalty as &s;hall be thought fit.</P>
<P>If &s;uch a ree&s;tabli&s;hment of the Admiralities, Vice-Admi|ralties
<PB N="5" REF="4">were made, be&s;ides, the benefit of ea&s;ily &s;upplying the Fleet wih Mariners, the&s;e further advantages would ac|crue to ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> Maje&s;ties and &s;uch of their Subjects and Allyes as &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">e concerned in Sea-affairs, which will tend very much to the advancement of Trade and Navigation.</P>
<P N="1">1. In t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">me of War the Officers of the &s;everal Vice-Admi|ralties, night take the care and charge of all Prizes brought into thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> re&s;pective Di&s;tricts, which would make the bu&s;i|ne&s;s mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters"> more ea&s;ie, and al&s;o &s;ave a great part of the charge to their Maje&s;ties; for it may be ea&s;ily demon&s;tra|ted whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ever it &s;hall be required, that this bu&s;ine&s;s may be manage<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> for own third part of the proceed of Prizes, and the ot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">er two thirds may be applied to the Che&s;t at <HI>Chath|am,</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">d given to the Captor and his Crew, as is before hinted.</P>
<P N="2">2. Their Maje&s;ties and the Lord Admiral's Rights and Per|qui&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">es in time of Peace as well as War would be pre&s;er|ved. whereas at pre&s;ent no manner of care is taken thereof, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">with&s;tanding that they are many times of a con&s;iderable value.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Cu&s;toms of Goods Ship-wrecked as well as the Lord Admiral's due will be better pre&s;erved, and their Maje&s;ties will not be &s;o ea&s;ily defrauded thereof by People that &s;teal &s;uch Goods, or by inferiour Officers conniving at, or combi|ning with them: not only becau&s;e the Vice-Admirals, who have the care thereof are u&s;ually Noblemen, or Gentlemen of the be&s;t Qualities and E&s;tates, and &s;o have great Autho|rity and Power in their &s;everal Countries, but al&s;o be|cau&s;e the Vice-Admiral or his Officer, and the Cu&s;tomer, will each of them be obliged to &s;et a Lock on the &s;alved Goods, and one will be a check upon the other.</P>
<P N="4">4. Where Merchants are in di&s;tre&s;s at Sea near the Shoar, or run a ground, the Officers of the Vice-Admirals would be ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t, knowing that they &s;hall be recom|penced according to their pains, and puni&s;hed if they re|fu&s;e: Whereas at pre&s;ent the Country People make a prey of tho&s;e mi&s;erable Merchants, and will afford no manner of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but rather contrive all they can that the Ship may be ca&s;t away, nay many times are &s;o barbarous to kill or drown People making e&s;cape to land, that thereby they might have a pretence to a Wreck.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="5">
<P N="5">5. When Ships or Goods are ca&s;t away, and any part thereof driven on Shoar, the Vice-Admirals would take care to keep off the Rabble, and &s;ecure all f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">r their true Proprietors, upon moderate Salvage, whereas at pre&s;ent every one taketh away what he can get, and no emedy.</P>
<P N="6">6. If the Vice-Admirals or their Officers happened not to be pre&s;ent at the time when any Ship was ca&s;t away, or Goods driven on Shoar, they would as they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">id u&s;ually in that ca&s;e heretofore, i&s;&s;ue out Commi&s;&s;ions of Enquiry, or procure &s;uch Commi&s;&s;ions from the High Cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">t of Ad|miralty, and &s;ummon what Per&s;ons they plea&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> before them, and &s;o examin by Maritime evidence, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ake im|mediate re&s;titution of all that was &s;aved to the Ow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ers up|on &s;uch Salvage as was meet, and puni&s;h all the Ofenders that &s;tole away, or embezeled the &s;aid Goods; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">hereas that Juri&s;diction being now interrupted, there is no relief for the Sufferers but by way of <HI>Trover, Tre&s;pa&s;s,</HI> or other Actions at Common-Law, which mu&s;t be brought &s;eparately again&s;t the &s;everal Parties offending; the multiplicity of &s;uch &s;uits will in the end but add to their Affliction in &s;pen|ding their time and mony; for many times at the la&s;t, when they have &s;tayed half a year or more for the A&s;&s;izes, and tho&s;e things are brought on to a tryal, it &s;o happens that the Witne&s;&s;es (who&s;e whole livelihood con&s;i&s;t's in trade and being on board Ships) are gone to Sea, and &s;o Evidence cannot be brough<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Viva Voce</HI> to prove the intere&s;t in the Goods, as tho&s;e ways of Action require.</P>
<P N="7">7. Mariners will have a quick and ea&s;ie di&s;patch in the Admiralty Courts, they being always open and ready to de|termine at one hearing in a Week's time, or le&s;s, when|ever they come on Shoar; and they may al&s;o joyn a whole Crew in one Action, whereas at Common Law they mu&s;t be &s;everal, and mu&s;t al&s;o attend the Terms or A&s;&s;izes, which they cannot do without Io&s;ing their employments.</P>
<P N="8">8. Builders of Ships and Material-Men, who furni&s;h them with all &s;orts of Provi&s;ion for &s;etting them forth to Sea, would in the Admiralty Courts have likewi&s;e a quick di&s;patch and remedy again&s;t the Ship by them built, re|paired and furni&s;hed; whereas at pre&s;ent if the Party that they contracted with for the &s;ame, proves in&s;olvent, and procures a Prohibition, which is u&s;ually done, they have no
<PB N="7" REF="5">remedy at all, which is a great Di&s;couragement to &s;etting out of Ships, and has occa&s;ioned frequent and very grievous Complaints.</P>
<P N="9">9. Upon the E&s;tabli&s;hment of tho&s;e Courts, the Fi&s;heries on all the Coa&s;ts and Navigable Rivers would be pre&s;erved; about which, no effectual care is taken at the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P N="10">10. All Annoyances in Ports and Navigable Rivers would be pre&s;ented in the Admiralty-Courts, and Offenders puni&s;h|ed, and made re&s;pon&s;ible for Damages done thereby; which of late has been neglected, and no Relief to be had for &s;uch as have &s;uffered thereby, e&s;pecially, where a Ship or Anchor doth Damage, and the Ma&s;ter thereof proves in&s;olvent.</P>
<P N="11">11. The Re-&s;etling of the&s;e Courts would be an In|couragement to Men of Parts, to apply them&s;elves to the Study of the Laws of Nations, and of the Sea; whereas at this time, that Profe&s;&s;ion, heretofore thought to be of &s;ome u&s;e to the Government, &s;eems to be altogether di&s;continued and neglected. However, it is not the benefit of any Pro|fe&s;&s;ion that is to be regarded in this matter, but the general Advantage of the People, for which end all Laws are made; and if tho&s;e Laws afford the be&s;t Remedy, in all rea&s;on, they ought to take place, and be promoted.</P>
<P>The Common Law, although mo&s;t excellent in its kind, yet being framed for Land Affairs only, will be found too narrow for the Deci&s;ion of all the Differences ari&s;ing among Sea-faring Men and Merchants. Nay, the very <HI>Roman</HI> Laws acknowledged by all to be the mo&s;t comprehen&s;ive, are deficient in tho&s;e Ca&s;es, unle&s;s they take in the Maritime Laws, the ex|cellency of which doth not only con&s;i&s;t in proper Rules, made by the long Ob&s;ervation of Traders, but al&s;o, in the incomparable di&s;patch that is given to Maritime Affairs at all times and &s;ea&s;ons; a thing ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the Incouragement of Trade and Navigation, and no where el&s;e to be had, but in the Courts of Ju&s;tice, E&s;tabli&s;hed for that end and purpo&s;e: And this may be plainly demon&s;trated in the following Ca&s;es.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cau&s;es of Bottomry.</NOTE> By the Common Law the Ma&s;ter cannot Pawn the Ship for Nece&s;&s;aries, altho in the greate&s;t Extremity, and therefore a Voyage is many times lo&s;t; but by the Laws of the Admiral|ty the Ship is chargeable upon Bills of Bottomry, provided that the Mony advanced be proved to be laid out for things actually employed in and about the Ship, being in ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, and without which &s;he could not proceed, whereby the Voyage is performed: And if the Admiralty Juri&s;diction be ob&s;tructed in this, a nece&s;&s;ary expedient of Navigation would be lo&s;t, and our Ships when driven into Foreign parts, mu&s;t lye there, till the Ma&s;ter can &s;end home, and pro|cure Mony to be remitted to him; whereas the Ship with other Nations is the &s;tanding Credit in &s;uch ca&s;es of Ne|ce&s;&s;ity.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Contracts made beyond the Seas.</NOTE> Contracts made beyond the Seas concerning Maritime Affairs may more conveniently be tried in the Admiralty, than at the Common Law, becau&s;e the Witne&s;&s;es cannot oftentimes attend at the Tryal, as the cour&s;e of that Law requires; but in the Admiralty they may be at any time taken in Writing, or if there be occa&s;ion, examined by Commi&s;&s;ion in Foreign parts.</P>
<P>Contracts beyond Sea are made by the Rules of the Mari|time Laws, and by Per&s;ons Experienced therein, and there|fore Foreigners have rea&s;on to expect to be Tryed by the &s;ame Laws here, as well as in their own Country: For if the Validity of &s;uch Contracts &s;hould be Tryed by the Common Law, which differs from the Rules of the Maritime Laws, the Contract that was as well and firmly made by them, as was po&s;&s;ible, may in the end have no effect and force.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="7">
<P N="5">5.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Damages at Sea, and in Navigable Rivers.</NOTE> If Damages happen by ill Stowage, or In&s;ufficiency of the Ship, or by rea&s;on of Storms, or the like, there are known Laws whereby the Admiralty Court u&s;es to Proceed.</P>
<P>If Damage be done by one &s;hip running again&s;t another at Sea, or in Navigable Rivers, or by Anchors for want of Buoys, or the like, the utmo&s;t remedy that the Common Law gives, is again&s;t the Ma&s;ter and Mariners, which are for the mo&s;t part in&s;olvent, unknown, or ab&s;ent: In all which Ca&s;es the Laws u&s;ed in the Admiralty give remedy again&s;t the Ship.</P>
<P>In ca&s;e of the lo&s;s of a Ship before it comes to the Port of Delivery, by the Maritime Laws the Mariners &s;hall receive Wages, and the Owners Freight to the la&s;t Port of Delivery and no farther; but by the Common Law for &s;o long as they have Served, lo&s;s or not lo&s;s they may recover: Likewi&s;e in ca&s;e of Average or ca&s;ting Goods over Board in a Storm, the Ma&s;ter, Mariners, and Owners &s;hall bear their proportion of the Lo&s;s: which things altho they are very ju&s;t and equitable, and great obligations to u&s;e care and diligence, yet are un|known and not ob&s;erved in Proceedings at Common Law.</P>
<P N="6">6.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mariners Wages.</NOTE> If the Mariner knows he mu&s;t Sue for his Wages in the Admiralty, and not at the Common Law, he will be there|by obliged to more Diligence and Obedience: For if he be Mutinous, Di&s;obedient, or De&s;erts the Ship, he makes a total Forfeiture of all his Wages: If he purloyns or embezels any of the Goods, or be faulty in the due Stowage thereof, or damage happens for want of Pumping, or through his default, his Wages will be lyable to a proportionable &s;atisfaction; whereas at Common Law, the Mariner will recover his Wages for &s;o long time as he has Served, and leave the Commander or Owner of the Ship or Goods, to &s;eek his Satisfaction for the Damages afore&s;aid; and this may al&s;o be done by Letter of Attorny, and &s;o there is no remedy, which is a great di&s;|couragement to Foreigners to lade their Goods on <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;els. And as the Mariner is Puni&s;hed if he be Faulty, &s;o he has an ea&s;y relief in the Admiralty, if he doth his Duty.</P>
<P>The nece&s;&s;ity of a Mariner's condition requires a quick di&s;|patch, which is accordingly provided for by the Court of Admiralty, kept weekly in the Vacations, as well as in the Terms: And altho Forty Mariners may be included in one Action, yet the whole may be Determined in a Weeks time;
<PB N="11" REF="7">whereas, at the Common Law, every Mariner mu&s;t bring his &s;everal Action, to the great charge of the &s;everal De|fendants as well as them&s;elves, and mu&s;t all attend till the Term or A&s;&s;izes for a Tryal, and perhaps at la&s;t want evi|dence, when in the Admiralty he can have the Oath of the Contractor, for di&s;covering the Contract, which is u&s;ually private, and not to be proved by Witne&s;&s;es. Be&s;ides by the cour&s;e of Common Law the remedy for the Mariner is only again&s;t the Contractor, who may not be found, or el&s;e in&s;olvent; but in ca&s;e he be found, and &s;olvent there is another inconvenience on the other &s;ide, for the Contractor will be forced to pay the whole Wages, and yet many times cannot recover the &s;hares that are due from his part-own|ers, without a Chancery-&s;uit; whereas in the Admiralty, the Mariner may have relief again&s;t the Ship or Freight that is due, and the whole difference be determined at once.</P>
<P N="7">7.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Freight and Charter-Parties.</NOTE> There is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary a relation betwixt Freight and Wages, that it will be very inconvenient to try them in &s;eparate Judicatures. Becau&s;e,</P>
<P N="1">1. U&s;ually the Wages are paid out of the Freight.</P>
<P N="2">2. There be divers ca&s;es wherein Mariners Wages are to be abated, in re&s;pect of an abatement of Freight, as in ca&s;e of lo&s;s or &s;poiling the Merchants Goods.</P>
<P N="3">3. If the Ma&s;ter and Owner are &s;ued in the Admiralty for Wages, and forced to &s;ue at Common Law for Freight out of which they &s;hould pay &s;uch Wages, perhaps a Judg|ment may pa&s;s again&s;t them immediately upon a &s;ummary hearing in the Admiralty, and yet they &s;hall not be able to recover their Freight, in three Months time or longer at the common Law.</P>
<P N="4">4. There is a nece&s;&s;ity in many ca&s;es to depart from the Letter of the Charter-Party, otherwi&s;e the Merchant, Ma&s;t|er and Owner may be ruined. This the Maritime Laws and cour&s;e of Admiralty doth permit, which the Common Law doth not. For in&s;tance,
<Q>A Contract is made for &s;ix months, payable monthly by the Charter-Party; yet if within the time the Ship be embargoed, no Freight &s;hall be paid for that time; likewi&s;e, if the Goods peri&s;h before a Port be made, there is no Frieght or Wages to be paid.</Q></P>
<PB N="12" REF="8">
<P N="5">5. The Freight of one Voyage is the &s;upply of another, and therefore requires a very quick di&s;patch, for the ad|vancement of Trade and Navigation, which is &s;etled by the cour&s;e of Admiralty, and cannot be by the cour&s;e of Common Law.</P>
<P N="6">6. The Freighter may be upon or beyond the Sea, and cannot be arre&s;ted, or maybe in&s;olvent, whereby the Ma&s;t|er and the Owner of the Ship is remedile&s;s at the Com|mon Law; but by the Maritime Law the Goods may be arre&s;ted, and upon default condemned for the payment of the Freight; and this is the great &s;ecurity of the Ma&s;ter and Owner.</P>
<P N="7">7. If Freight mu&s;t be &s;ued for at Common Law, the Ma&s;ter and Owners of the Ship may &s;ue for the &s;ame by Letter of Attorney, and the Freight &s;hall not be &s;top'd for damage done to the Goods, or embezelments: For the cour&s;e of Common Law is not to &s;top by way of compen&s;ation, but a Verdict pa&s;&s;es for the Freight upon the Charter-Party, according to agreement, and &s;o the Owner of the Goods is defeated of his &s;atisfaction, accord|ing to the Maritime Law for damage, or embezelments, be&s;ides the inconveniency of multiplying Actions; whereas the whole may be more properly decided, by one and the &s;ame Action in the Admiralty, and many times is done upon a &s;ummary hearing, in a Week or Fortnights time, by which means, the great expence of Mony and Time, two of the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies of Trade is pre|vented.</P>
<P N="8">8.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mi&s;demea|nours and Nu|&s;ances in na|vigable Ri|vers.</NOTE> Mi&s;demeanours and Nu&s;ances in navigable Rivers did formerly, and may again with great conveniency be &s;etled under the Admiralty Juri&s;diction. The Com|mon Law doth not, and if the Admiralty &s;hould not intermeddle, there will be a failure of Ju&s;tice in tho&s;e ca&s;es.</P>
<P>A Merchant lives beyond Sea,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Foreign|ers debts.</NOTE> or cannot be found, but has a Ship come into a Port, or Navigable River, or it may be, has Goods on Board, and owes &s;ome of Their Maje&s;ties Subjects Mony; one of the&s;e Arre&s;teth the Ship or Goods by an Admiralty-Warrant, and thereupon Bail is given to the Action: Is it not rea&s;onable that Their Maje&s;ties Subjects &s;hould proceed to Sentence, and have the benefit of the Law
<PB N="13" REF="8">of Nations? Shall a Prohibition be &s;ent to &s;top Proceedings, when the Common Law can give him no Remedy? Or, that one of Their Maje&s;ties Courts &s;hould hinder the other, when they can give no manner of Relief them&s;elves? This is cer|tainly to be redre&s;&s;ed, if Trade be to be incouraged, &s;ince it pre&s;erves Foreigners and Fugitives from paying their ju&s;t Debts, by rea&s;on that their Per&s;ons cannot be apprehended.</P>
<P>If the&s;e Matters may be thought fit to be re&s;etled in the Admiralty Court, it is humbly de&s;ired, That leave may be obtained for bringing a Bill into Parliament for that end, &s;o that it may be po&s;itively determined, what Cau&s;es &s;hall be|long to that Juri&s;diction: For the old Statutes that re&s;train it, as they have in the late Reigns been put in Execution, are the terrour of Merchants, Owners, Material-Men, and others that live by Sea-Trade, in&s;omuch, that they dare not think of &s;uing in the Admiralty, for their ju&s;t Damages and Debts, contracted by Maritime Employments, but are forced con|tentedly to &s;it down with &s;uch their Lo&s;&s;es, for fear of being &s;ued at the common Law, upon the Action of double Da|mages, which is very hard; when thereby they are not only deprived of the be&s;t Relief, but in many of the foregoing Ca&s;es, they have no ways to begin an Action at Common Law.</P>
<P>This Juri&s;diction has been &s;everal times &s;etled, particularly by the King in Council, in the year 1632. after which it being interrupted, it was in the late times thought nece&s;&s;ary to be re&s;etled by Ordinances of Parliament, as may be &s;een in <HI>Scobell</HI>'s Collection, <HI>C.</HI> 112. <HI>Anno</HI> 1648. <HI>f.</HI> 147. and <HI>C.</HI> 23. <HI>Anno</HI> 1649. <HI>f.</HI> 16. Since the Re&s;tauration it has been again interrupted by Prohibitions, which gave occa&s;ion for &s;everal Petitions from many con&s;iderable Merchants, Ma&s;ters, Owners, and Material-Men; one of which Petitions is here|unto annexed, but they could have no relief during the two la&s;t Reigns. However it is hoped, that this Parliament will re&s;tore &s;o nece&s;&s;ary an incouragement of Trade and Navi|gation, the cheife&s;t Wealth and Support of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be expected, that &s;ome of the common Lawyers will oppo&s;e &s;uch a Bill, for the &s;ame rea&s;ons that &s;ome Civili|ans will promote it: But either of their private Advantages is not to be regarded, but only the publick Good. It may be ea&s;ily demon&s;trated, that the Admiralty anciently had
<PB N="14" REF="9">cognizance of many more Cau&s;es than are above-mentioned: And on the other &s;ide it is as plain, that Prohibitions have been awarded in mo&s;t, if not all of them: But Arguments drawn from thence, would do no more than tell the World, that one Juri&s;diction oppre&s;&s;ed the other, according as it had Power, and between both, did grind and harre&s;s the Subject, and is a better rea&s;on for &s;etling the Juri&s;diction, than for &s;erving the private ends of either Party. And there need be no more other weight laid upon what is urged from thence, but rather to pa&s;s by all Di&s;putes of that kind, and not &s;o much examine, whether Prohibitions have been duly or unduly &s;ent to the Admiralty, of which there will be no end; (as may appear by the &s;everal fruitle&s;s Tracts that have been publi&s;hed to that purpo&s;e on each &s;ide,) but rather to con&s;ider, what is fit and expedient to be done for the general Advantage of the Kingdom; and what Courts, what Laws, and which Profe&s;&s;ion can mo&s;t ea&s;ily and readily ad|mini&s;ter Ju&s;tice to the Subject in the foregoing Ca&s;es.</P>
