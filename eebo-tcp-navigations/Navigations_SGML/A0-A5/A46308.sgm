<P>THe War in which the <HI>Confederates</HI> are at
pre&s;ent engag'd again&s;t that Disturber of
all <HI>Europe,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> King, having been
of late the chief Subject of Di&s;cour&s;e a|mong&s;t
all &s;orts of People; nothing certainly can be
more diverting, than to entertain the Reader with
a <HI>Diary</HI> of the Proceedings this la&s;t <HI>Campaign</HI> in
<HI>Flanders;</HI> wherein is very carefully and particular|ly
&s;et down, whatever may be thought worthy of Re|mark.
And, whereas in mo&s;t <HI>Hi&s;tories,</HI> many Things
are taken meerly upon Tru&s;t or Heare&s;ay, our Author
(who was a Per&s;on of Worth and Note, and had a
Con&s;iderable Post in the Army) being an Eye Witne&s;s of
every Tran&s;action; the Reader is not in the least Dan|ger
of being impos'd upon, or of &s;wallowing Fables and
Fal&s;ities in&s;tead of Truths. But, be&s;ides the <HI>Military</HI>
Tran&s;actions, you have likewi&s;e here a <HI>Topographical</HI>
De&s;cription of tho&s;e Places the Army pa&s;s'd through in
their March; in which, the Situation of the <HI>Towns,</HI>
their <HI>Fortifications, Buildings, Curio&s;ities, Cu&s;toms</HI>
of the People, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are not omitted.</P>
<P>And, what is &s;till more inviting; all tho&s;e who are
Friends to the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Intere&s;t, mu&s;t needs take
infinit Plea&s;ure in &s;eeing that good Agreement among&s;t
<PB REF="3">
the <HI>Confederates;</HI> which is no &s;mall Pre&s;age of Victory
and future Succe&s;s. For, if the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> by their
being &V;nanimous, &s;trike Terror and Amazement a|mong&s;t
the <HI>Infidels</HI> in <HI>Hungary, Venice, Dalmatia,</HI>
and wherever they come; we need not doubt, but, if
we take Advantage of this happy Juncture of Affairs,
and proceed as &V;naimou&s;ly as we have begun; not only
to re&s;cue from Slavery many of tho&s;e poor Creatures who
groan under the <HI>French</HI> Yoak, but &s;o to humble that
proud <HI>Mon&s;ter,</HI> as to make him beg leave to live quietly at

<HEAD>A True Relation of the Actions and

<P><HI>Bril,</HI> Is &s;urrounded with a Water and a Sodwork-Forti|fication,
which is very Regular; here we made no &s;tay,
but &s;ailed with the greate&s;t ha&s;t up the <HI>Maze</HI> to <HI>Rotterdam;</HI>
having by the way the diver&s;ion of &s;eeing <HI>How&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">dike,
Blackwall, Lorden, Skelden,</HI> and &s;everal other very pretty
Towns &s;ituated along the River.</P>
<P><HI>Rotterdam,</HI> Here we &s;tay'd three days, and were di|verted
daily with viewing the admirable neatne&s;s and curi|ous
order of every thing, relating to the Hou&s;es and
Streets of this fair City, where no Carts are &s;uffered, but
Sledds and Wheelbarrows, that the Pavements may not
<PB N="2" REF="4">
be endamaged: <MILESTONE N="June 14th 1689."> In the Market-Place of this Town, is the
Statue of <HI>Era&s;mus</HI> in Bra&s;s: In the great Church, is the Mo|nument
of Admiral <HI>Du Wit;</HI> to the top of the Steeple is
One Hundred and Twenty Steps. Ships of large Burthen,
come up to mo&s;t of the Hou&s;es in the Town; for the
Conveniency of their Pa&s;&s;age there are &s;everal Draw-Bridges,
which are rai&s;ed to give way when their occa&s;ions
lead them to bring them up or down. The Banks of
the Rivers, which are the Streets, are planted with Lime
and Elm-Trees, which give their Shade in Summer and
Shelter in Winter, and are a very great Ornament to the
Town; the middle of who&s;e Streets, are very curiou&s;ly
Paved with Stone; and the out&s;ide for two yards broad,
with Clinker-Brick: Their Doors and Window-&s;hutters, are
all painted Green: Their Hou&s;es are neatly kept within,
and placed in admirable order without: Their Men are
tollerably fa&s;hionable, but their Women are generally Fat,
burly and un&s;ightly; they all go in Slippers, and their
Coats come down but half way their Legs. Here is a
&s;umptuous <HI>Stadhou&s;e</HI> and <HI>Exchange,</HI> and I think every thing
that can contribute to the compo&s;ing of a lovely, decent,
rich, commodious City. On the 14th we went to <HI>Delf,</HI> in
order to &s;ee the <HI>Hague.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Delf,</HI> To this place it is by Water two Leagues from
<HI>Rotterdam.</HI> Our Boat was drawn by a Hor&s;e, rid by a Boy, who
Trots him all the way, and in two hours time comes to his
Journeys end. There are about &s;orty of the&s;e Boats (which
are much like your Aldermens Barges on the <HI>Thames</HI>)
which will contain about Forty Pa&s;&s;engers; the&s;e Boats are
&s;o ordered, that one of them is to go this Cour&s;e every
half hour: There are likewi&s;e at <HI>Delf</HI> other Boats, which
are obliged to go every hour to the <HI>Hague.</HI> The Buildings
of this City are much after the &s;ame manner with <HI>Rotterdam:</HI>
Here are two &s;pacious Churches, hung all round and richly
beautified with Coats of Arms; in the Old Church lyeth
the Body and Monument of Admiral <HI>Van Trump;</HI> in the
New Church lyeth Interred the Body of <HI>William Henrick
<PB N="3" REF="4">

From <HI>Delf</HI> to the <HI>Hague</HI> is a League by Water, and it co&s;ts
Two Pence half peny the Pa&s;&s;age in one of the foremen|tioned
Boats.</P>
<P><HI>Hague,</HI> Here is the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Court about a
quarter of a League from the Town (for this is not a City,
although it doth &s;urpa&s;s &s;everal Cities iin Grandure.) In a
Grove hard by, is a very fine Mall. In the <HI>Stadhou&s;e</HI> of
this Town is the Burgerma&s;ters Chamber, wherein is
placed the Strappado: Two Leagues from this place is
<HI>Houn&s;lerdike,</HI> where the Prince hath a very &s;tately Pallace,
whereunto appertaineth &s;everal Rarities, among which is
an O&s;tridg and &s;ome Indian Oxen; He hath likewi&s;e another
fine Pallace in the Grove near the <HI>Hague,</HI> in which is a very
&s;pacious Hall adorned with &s;everal curious Sculptures; from
the <HI>Hague</HI> to <HI>Skeeveline</HI> is a Walk about two Miles in length,
paved all the way with Clinker-Brick. About half way is the
Heer <HI>Bentings</HI> Hou&s;e, now Earl of <HI>Portland,</HI> whereunto apper|taineth
a very famous Orange Garden, with a large Bird-Cage
which is &s;ixteen Rood long, and twelve Foot broad:
To the top of the great Steeple of the <HI>Hagus</HI> is Three
hundred Steps, and in the Church thereof is the Monu|ment
of <HI>Obdam,</HI> the famous Admiral of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet,
who was blown up together with his Ship as he was coming
to an Engagement with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet. Mo&s;t of the
Gentry and Nobility in this part of the Country, have Ha|bitations
in this Town; they u&s;e few Coaches, but generally
ride in an open kind of Chariot, which defends them from
neither Wind nor Sun; the Carriages thereof are not &s;lung
as in <HI>England,</HI> &s;o that they are little better than a gilded
<PB N="4" REF="5">
Car: <MILESTONE N="June. 20. 1689."> The Women appear very mode&s;tly (or rather un|mannerly
Coy) not &s;uffering a Man &s;o much as to touch
their Hands, without &s;hewing a di&s;like thereunto. This
Town is likewi&s;e famous for a Spin-hou&s;e, in nature of a
<HI>Bridewell,</HI> which is for re&s;training of Burgerma&s;ters Daugh|ters
which lead lewd lives, upon di&s;covery whereof they
are confined to this hou&s;e for a year and a day. And from
hence we were ordered to <HI>Breda,</HI> to joyn the Troop of
Guards formerly gone thither; in Obedience to which we
came back to <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> and began our Journey from thence
on the Twentieth, and in two days arrived at our Journeys
end, through a Country where to &s;ee a Stone is a Miracle; the
Land there &s;eems lower than the Sea, and I do believe &s;o it
is; for, half the Country would be overflown with the Sea;
were it not for a great Multitude of Windmills that are kept
con&s;tantly imploy'd in draining the Land by a pretty kind of
Stratagem. There are &s;everal Towns, and good Entertain|ment
on the Road, wherein I ob&s;erved no great Super&s;tition
(wherewith <HI>Brabant</HI> is horribly pe&s;tered) &s;ave in the matter
of the Stork, which they account lucky both to particular
Per&s;ons and the publick State; they being po&s;&s;e&s;t with a
fond conceit, that they have a &s;ecret In&s;tinct in them, which
teaches them to abhor Monarchy, and that therefore they
will breed no where but in a free State; and therefore they
build their Ne&s;ts for them in the Tops of their Chimneys,
where they delight to breed. But if they chance to breed
on the Top of a Burgerma&s;ters Chimney, they will rather
choo&s;e to lo&s;e the benefit of the Fire-place, than di&s;turb
this lucky Bird; the Laws of the Land Protect them, and
make it Penal to de&s;troy them; for which there is a natural
rea&s;on, e&s;pecially in a Country where Frogs and Toads do &s;o
much abound, of which Vermin the&s;e Birds are great
de&s;troyers: and of which &s;ort of Vermin, and Provi&s;ion
for the Storks, there is &s;uch plenty here, that if almo&s;t
all the Birds in the Air were Storks, they may be fea&s;ted in
<HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="5">
<HI>Breda,</HI> <MILESTONE N="June 23. 1689."> When we arrived there, we were &s;urprized to
ride over five or &s;ix Draw-Bridges, before we came to the
Town; as &s;oon as you enter the Gates, which (if a Stran|ger,
they will not &s;uffer you to do without a great deal of
Caution) you are carry'd to the Governour, before whom
you mu&s;t give an Account of your &s;elf: This is a large
orderly City, only that they are not &s;o curious in their
Hou&s;es, as they are in other Parts of <HI>Holland,</HI> though clean|ly
enough. It belongs entirely to the Prince of <HI>Orange:</HI>
It is &s;o well fortified, both by Nature and Art, that 'tis
even impregnable, be&s;ides the Rampierts, which are all
arched underneath with a &s;trong Brick Arch, and are rai&s;ed
higher than the Hou&s;es of the Town, whereon is an Enne|agon;
there are two Pair of Outworks, each encompa&s;&s;ed
with a broad deep Water; on the Government of this Ci|ty
do depend &s;eventeen other Towns of Note in the Pro|vince
of <HI>Brabant.</HI> This City was taken by a Wile from the
<HI>Spaniard,</HI> by King <HI>Williams</HI> Grand-Father; our King hath
a very fine Ca&s;tle and Garden here. There is likewi&s;e a
very remarkable Steeple here, which is in height four hun|dred
and thirty four Steps, all of carved Stone; wherein is a
delicate Ring of Bells, which chime every half hour, to
give notice of the Clocks going to &s;trike, which &s;trikes here
&s;o often; the&s;e Bells will readily and &s;weetly chime to any
time. Near to the Top of this mighty Structure, in a
round Ball, liveth a Trumpeter and his whole Family, which
by rea&s;on of the height, &s;eems to them that &s;tand on the
Ground, to be no bigger than that you may gra&s;p it in your
Arms: This Trumpeter is to &s;ound every Night, after the
Gates are locked, to give an Account that the City is &s;afe.
<MILESTONE N="27"> On the Twenty &s;eventh, the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> received a
Portent from Prince <HI>Waldeck,</HI> to march to the Army, which
was encamped at <HI>Perway;</HI> <MILESTONE N="28"> accordingly on the Twenty eighth
we marched to a City called <HI>Lunehout.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lunehout,</HI> Here we were quartered at Country Hou|&s;es,
it being the Cu&s;tom of this Country, to give Free
<PB N="6" REF="6">
Quarters to the Souldiers on their March; <MILESTONE N="June 28 1689."> but the Hou&s;es
were for&s;aken by the Inhabitants. In our March through
this Country, I ob&s;erved that every little Hou&s;e had a
Hop-Garden belonging to it; <MILESTONE N="29"> the next Day we marched to
<HI>Skell.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="29"><HI>Skell,</HI> Here I had the Opportunity of Waiting on the
Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> to <HI>Antwerp.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Antwerp,</HI> This is reputed the chiefe&s;t Town in all
<HI>Flanders;</HI> the mo&s;t beautiful, and the &s;tronge&s;t &s;ituated;
for the better Defence whereof, there is a &s;trong Cittadel,
formed with five Ba&s;tions; <MILESTONE N="July 1 1689.">  &s;ome of the Streets of this City
are &s;ixty Paces broad; in the Middle of the great Street is
the Statue of our Saviour on the Cro&s;s, carved at large and
gilded; at the Entrance of the Gates, and Corners of eve|ry
Street, is carved the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> with our Saviour in her
Arms, and at the Foot of them a Place to kneel and wor|&s;hip:
In this City are twenty five Colledges, Nunneries,
and Religious Hou&s;es: No Art can exceed the Curio&s;ity of
the Je&s;uits Chappel in its Structure and Ornaments, which
is wain&s;coated with all &s;orts of Marble; the Roof is painted
by the be&s;t Hands: They were &s;o free as to &s;hew us all
their Riches, which they valued to two Millions: They
have for every Holy Day a &s;everal Skreen to draw before
their Altar, which is richly painted and embroidered; you
may go from hence to any Part of <HI>Holland</HI> by Water, &s;o
you may to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els:</HI> Here is likewi&s;e a Nunnery furni&s;hed
with <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nuns, who appear extream Civil, but are great
Bigots in their Religion, and great <HI>Athenians,</HI> as to News:
From hence we went to <HI>Lire.</HI> <MILESTONE N="2"> </P>
<P><HI>Lire,</HI> Which is Two Leagues from <HI>Antwerp:</HI> Here is a|nother
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nunnery. This Town is not very &s;trong,
but is a good Market Town, where all Provi&s;ions are
plentiful and cheap; <MILESTONE N="3">  next Morning we went to <HI>Reminian.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6">
<HI>Reminian,</HI> <MILESTONE N="July 3 1689.">  Here all the Habitations were for&s;aken in a
Country full of &s;tanding Corn, who&s;e Soil is very fertile,
and all well tilled, yet we found a great Scarcity of all
manner of Provi&s;ions, which we &s;uppo&s;ed the Inhabitants
had withdrawn, by rea&s;on of the Army marching that way.
We are now come into the Land of Idolatry, where the
Images of the <HI>Virgin Mary,</HI> St. <HI>Ann</HI> and the Cro&s;s are wor|&s;hipped
in every Grove, under every green Tree, and at e|very
cro&s;s Way; the <HI>Canaanites</HI> could never arrive to a great|er
pitch of Idolatry; &s;o that this Land can be &s;o fitly like|ned
to nothing as to a Paradice inhabited with Devils;
and to &s;ay the truth, for their Complexion, the Inhabitants,
both Men and Women, may keep the Feinds Company, there
being no &s;uch ill-favoured megre Creatures in the whole
Univer&s;e, as are the&s;e <HI>Walloons,</HI> who &s;peak a broken <HI>French;</HI>
it is true, you may meet with a Prie&s;t or a Bacon-headed

them&s;elves all the fine Hou&s;es and Habitations, and I &s;uppo&s;e
all the Riches and Provi&s;ions in the Country: The next Day
we marched through <HI>Veltum</HI> to <HI>Bi&s;&s;en.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bi&s;&s;en,</HI> <MILESTONE N="4">  Here we had the Help of an Ale-hou&s;e for our
Refre&s;hment, which is all the Advantage we had beyond
our former Quarters, where we could get nothing for Love or
Money: <MILESTONE N="5">  The next Day we marched through <HI>Lovaine.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lovaine</HI> Is a large uniform plentiful City, whither all
the Gentry do repair from the Country, whil&s;t the Army is
in the Field. Here are eighteen Colledges and Mona&s;teries,
among which are all Orders of Monks and Fryers: In the
great Church of this Town (which is a very &s;tately Stru|cture)
is painted the whole Story of the Bible in the Gla&s;s.
There is likewi&s;e the Statue of our Saviour riding on an A&s;s.
This Church is much beautified with famous Sculptures&punc;

march that Night to <HI>Gree</HI> and <HI>Bee.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Gree and Bee,</HI> The Country began to be dangerous;
the Bores or Pea&s;ants being &s;o bloody, rude, and &s;urly, that
as they find an Opportunity, they knock what Souldiers they
can on the Head, and butcher them, though they gain no|thing
thereby but their Cloaths; as they did two of the
Lord of <HI>Oxford</HI>'s Regiment, which lurked behind us, and were
never heard of after; for which Rea&s;ons we encamped in a
Meadow that Night, and foraged our Hor&s;es, but could

fifteen great Cannon, twenty &s;ix of a le&s;&s;er &s;ort, and
twenty five &s;mall Field-Pieces, with four Mortars, and
thirty Tin Boats; all the Camp we found plenty enough

having fir&s;t cleared the Way for us to <HI>Sombreife.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sombreife,</HI> Here we encamped in two Lines, and
were joyned with &s;ome <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Brandenburghers,</HI> which
to all appearance were &s;tout likely Men. Here &s;ome of the
Lord of <HI>Oxford</HI>'s Regiment began to mutiny about their
Pay; whereupon one <HI>Boad,</HI> their Major &s;hot, one of them
trough the Head, who died within three Days, which qui|eted
the Mutiny, and the Major was ju&s;tified by the Court
Mar&s;hal for what he did. Here &s;everal <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Men among&s;t
the Foot, having con&s;pired to go over to the <HI>French</HI> Army,
were di&s;covered, and &s;hot to Death by Order of Court Mar|&s;hal:

<HI>Gerempont,</HI> <MILESTONE N="July 14. 1689.">  Here we encamped in three Lines, two

were great Parties commanded out every Night, and fre|quent
Alarums, but nothing of Action, &s;aving that a Party
of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> under the Command of a Lieutenant, run
away from a <HI>French</HI> Party, the Commander whereof, and
&s;ome of his Men were taken by another Party of ours;
but our Lieutenant that fled was &s;hot, and every Tenth

to de&s;ert our Army and go over to the <HI>French,</HI> &s;ome where|of
were taken in the Act, and &s;hot, but the Prie&s;t made his

they had into their Churches, or rather Temples of their
Gods, which alone are free from the Plunder of the Soul|diers,
having this Motto on them (<HI>Altare Privilegiatum.</HI>)

<P><HI>Charleroy,</HI> <MILESTONE N="17">  Here I had the Opportunity of ob&s;erving

This Place is memorable for nothing but that it is a good

ob&s;erved a great Market of <HI>French</HI> Hor&s;es, which had been

conceit, that that day is always pro&s;perous to their Arms;
which day being on the Sixteenth of this In&s;tant, proved
the direct contrary, their ra&s;hne&s;s being the occa&s;ion of
the lo&s;s of mo&s;t of the principal Officers of their Army,
be&s;ides 3000 Sentinels killed in the Field, and a number

the Brunt of the Battle, and by their bravery, gained the

Cannons playing all that while on both &s;ides; theirs did
us on mi&s;chief, but ours cut off &s;everal of their Hor&s;e, and
made Lanes through their Foot as they Retreated; which

Retreat, and &s;ent to our General for leave to bury their
Dead; to which the General gave his con&s;ent, after having
taken from them 12 of their Cannon, not e&s;teeming it advi|&s;eable
to follow Victory too far. In burying their dead they
had the Boars to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, for which rea&s;on, before we de|camped,

<PB N="19" REF="12">
Workmen all the Year imployed about it: <MILESTONE N="Sept. 2&punc; 1689.">  The Garden|plat
which is well walled about, cannot be le&s;s than three
Hundred Acres; in one part thereof is a &s;mall Deer-Park,
planted with &s;everal Groves, of divers &s;orts of plea&s;ant
&s;tately Trees, as Fir, Walnut, Che&s;nut, Spruce-Fir; in
the plea&s;ure Garden are 52 &s;mall Statues in &s;everal Po&s;tures,
and eight very large guilded, be&s;ides what are in the Hedges,
which all run Water: There are Flower-Pots betwixt every
Statue; there are likewi&s;e four Hou&s;es of Waterworks; in
the middle of the Park of <HI>Mazes</HI> is a Fountain, in an Octo|gon,
arched on &s;ixteen Pillars about twenty Foot high; on
the Top are eight great Lions cut at large in Stone; under
the Freez are eight <HI>Cae&s;ars</HI> Heads; The Fountain is railed,
and bana&s;tered about with Marble; the bottom being flagged,
and the &s;ides lined with the &s;ame, as are the other four Hou|&s;es
of Waterworks: From hence you &s;ee eight great Walks,
with Elm Hedges very curiou&s;ly cut: Joyning to which are
eight Labyrinths; on the &s;ide of the Walls are &s;everal regu|lar
Groves, &s;ome in a Triangle, &s;ome in a Quadrangle: In
this Town are &s;everal Convents of <HI>Carmelites,</HI> and <HI>Capuchines:</HI>
Here is al&s;o a Nunnery, and a &s;tately Church curiou&s;ly
beautified with Sculptures; this Town hath been walled, but
is now demoli&s;hed: Here we &s;tayed till the <HI>22th.</HI> and then we
marched to <HI>Syllie.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Syllie,</HI> This day the <HI>French</HI> hearing of our decamping, <MILESTONE N="22"> 
left the ground where they were very &s;trongly po&s;ted, in
great di&s;order; leaving behind them in the Hurry, &s;everal
Carriages, Barrels of Bear, Forrage, and other Luggage:
Neverthele&s;s we remained encamped at this place, till the
<HI>27th.</HI> and then marched in four Lines to <HI>Cambroug,</HI> where
we encamped in two Lines, Prince <HI>Vademont</HI>'s Army &s;till
keeping the Right.</P>
<P><HI>Cambroug,</HI> <MILESTONE N="27">  Here the <HI>French</HI> Army was encamped within a
League and a half of ours; who if they had a mind to &s;hew
fair play, need not want a delicate plain Champion Country
for it; there cannot be a plea&s;anter &s;ort of a Country, and
<PB N="20" REF="13">
more capable of Improvement in the World: <MILESTONE N="Sept. 27 1689.">  But the Inha|bitants
are &s;o given to Super&s;tition, and Idolatry, that it is
impo&s;&s;ible any thing &s;hould pro&s;per where they are. From
our Camp might be &s;een eleven Churches, the Country being
wholly dedicated to Religious Hou&s;es, which cannot be ter|med
any thing, &s;o properly, as Ne&s;ts of idle Idolatrous Peo|ple,
blind Leaders of the Blind, to whom the re&s;t of the In|habitants
are all Slaves; if it were not &s;o, and if it would
plea&s;e God to ble&s;s them with Peace, it would certainly be
as plea&s;ant, and plentiful, and perhaps as flouri&s;hing a Coun|try,
as any in the whole World: The chief of the&s;e Irreli|gious
Places, is the Hou&s;e from whence our Camp derives
its Name; it is walled round, &s;ituate in the mid&s;t of this
Plain by a River-&s;ide, 'twixt two of our Garri&s;ons, <HI>Ath</HI> and
<HI>Monts.</HI> Within the&s;e Walls is a famous Chappel, joyning to
the Cloy&s;ter, adorned with admirable Carvings, and extra|ordinary
Painting; in it are many rich Altars, which they
(at la&s;t) refu&s;ed to let our Guards &s;ee, becau&s;e, &s;aid they,
they have given Offence in not kneeling, at the lifting up
of the Ho&s;t; but another Chappel they were admitted in|to,
where (among other Fopperies and Trumperies) I ob|&s;erved
a little Prayer, hanged up in Latin, to be learnt
of all that came thither to devotion; the Prayer was to this
effect, <HI>That it would plea&s;e the Lady of</HI> Cambrogue, <HI>for the &s;ake
of the five Wounds, which her holy Image &s;uffered in that place, by
the hands of an un&s;anctified Jew, to grant five things; Namely,
that in the Hour of Death, they may not want the Company of a
Priest, whereby they may have the benefit of Auricular Confe&s;&s;ion,
Ab&s;olution, receiving the Sacrament, and being anointed with
Oil:</HI> This is a <HI>Carmelite</HI> Convent; They &s;tamp little Medals
of Silver, and &s;ell them to the People, whom they per&s;wade,
&s;hall by the wearing of them be kept from Sickne&s;s, Di&s;a|&s;ters,
Infection, or any Power of the Devil: This I heard
one of them aver. In the larger of the&s;e two Chappels is a
great Marble Pillar, <MILESTONE N="Octob. 2 1899.">  much like the Cro&s;s in <HI>Coventry,</HI> with
all the Popes and Fathers of the Church, engraven on it:
There is likewi&s;e engraven, the Expiration of our Saviour
on the Cro&s;s, under which is drawn to the life two Prie&s;ts,
<PB N="21" REF="13">
laying him in his Grave, with Women weeping, all cut at
large, in Marble: Here are likewi&s;e &s;everal large Tombs;
one of them, which is indeed very rich, belongs to the Fami|ly
of <HI>Enghion;</HI> others lye in Arches in the Wall, cut at large,
(impailed) in Iron grates; which though of &s;tone, are very
much defaced: which puts me in mind of <HI>Juvenal,</HI> who &s;ays,
That the very Marble Statues, and Monuments mu&s;t yield to
the corroding Nature of Time, and pay a Tribute to Death.
It is &s;aid, that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Army being about to
be betrayed into the hands of the <HI>French,</HI> by the treacherous
contrivance of the&s;e Fryars, he let his Soldiers plunder the
Church and take away all they had, whereof there is now no
&s;ign, they having &s;ince admirably enriched them&s;elves. Du|ring
our &s;tay here, I went to &s;ee <HI>Ath.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ath,</HI> <MILESTONE N="2">  This Town lieth at the We&s;t End of this Plain about
a League and a half from the Right of our Camp, which
&s;tretcheth it &s;elf, when they are Encamped, in two Lines, at
lea&s;t a League; the Fortification thereof is a Septagon, with
Out-works, an&s;werable to every Ba&s;tion; It is Palli&s;adoed and
Stakudoed with Turrets on the Walls, whereon are Golden
<HI>Flower de Luces,</HI> which &s;heweth that it was Fortified by the
<HI>French</HI> King, as was <HI>Charleroy,</HI> but by the Treaty of <HI>Nimi|guen</HI>
was &s;urrended to the <HI>Spaniard:</HI> In the Counter&s;carp are
Encamped a Regiment of Dragoons: In the Town are
Quartered Three <HI>Italian,</HI> and Two <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Regiments of Foot;
on the Walls and Ramparts, rows of large flouri&s;hing Lime|trees,
which adorn the Town and &s;helter the Building there|of
from Bombs: You go over Four Draw-bridges before
you enter the Gates of the Town, which is encompa&s;&s;ed
with a large wet Ditch and a &s;trong Fo&s;sbray; There are Four
Gates to the Town, and Two Port-Cullis to every Gate;
there is likewi&s;e a magnificent Church with Thirteen Altars;
the great Altar hath on it the A&s;cention of our Saviour, En|graven
with a great deal of Co&s;t and Art; on another is the
Pa&s;&s;ion of our Saviour cut in Bra&s;s: The work of this Church,
is mo&s;t in Bra&s;s, as is <HI>Cambrogue</HI> in poli&s;hed Marble of all
colours: This Town is famous for good Buff, which is &s;old,
<PB N="22" REF="14">
very cheap. On the Fourth I waited on the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI>
to <HI>Monts,</HI> in company of Twenty of our Guards.</P>
<P><HI>Monts,</HI> <MILESTONE N="4">  This Town is built on a Hill, which is all &s;ur|rounded
with Mar&s;hy ground; the Out-works are Sod works,
not very uniform; the Buildings and Streets are large and
hand&s;ome, as is the whole Town, but the Fortifications are
irregular, and &s;tronger by Nature than Art: It is &s;urround|ed
with a Wall, whereon are old-fa&s;hioned Turrets, notwith|&s;tanding
which, the Situation of the place makes it really
admirably Strong. The <HI>French,</HI> in King <HI>Charles</HI> the Seconds
time, laid Siege to this Town, but were beaten from it by
the powers of the renowned Earl of <HI>O&s;&s;ory.</HI> Within this
Town (on an hight) is Built a very high Piramid, whence
is a very great pro&s;pect, they &s;ay for Seven Leagues round:
On the top are Five round Turrets which are made u&s;e of
for Pri&s;ons; it is all Built of Carved &s;tone: This Town lies
to the Ea&s;t End of the afore&s;aid place, and is from our Camp
Four Leagues; in it are &s;everal Churches, Mona&s;teries, Nun|neries,
and other Religious Hou&s;es; there are Two very
magnificent Churches, one of the Canons, the other of the
Canone&s;&s;es; the latter is in every particular much after
the nature of them at <HI>Neville,</HI> but the Church is much more
a &s;plendid Church, and mo&s;t of the Ladies are related to
the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> King <HI>William,</HI> or Si&s;ters to &s;ome of the
<HI>German</HI> Princes: Here Count <HI>Horne</HI> invited the Duke to a
Ball, where the Canone&s;&s;es after Evening Service, Danced
(at their own Hou&s;e) with the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> and his Re|tinue.
The&s;e Ladies meddle not with Con&s;ecrating the Sa|crament,
which is left to the Prie&s;t. There occurred unto
me here a Super&s;titious Ceremony, namely, the carrying of
the Ho&s;t in Proce&s;&s;ion, attended with Organs, Voices, and
other Mu&s;ick playing all the way, whil&s;t Prie&s;ts went with
their Incen&s;e-pots fuming before it; it exceeds any <HI>Opera,</HI>
which is a &s;hew they much admire in the&s;e parts: In this
Church is placed on a Pede&s;tal in the middle of the I&s;le,
the Image of the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> Crowned, with our Saviour
in her Arms likewi&s;e Crowned; &s;he is Apparelled in a fine
<PB N="23" REF="14">
Cloth of Silver Gown, <MILESTONE N="Octob 4. 1689.">  and every one that comes thither to
Wor&s;hip, makes a low bow to the ground, and ki&s;&s;es the
Hem of her Garment. After all this view of their Churches,
which &s;trive every way to exceed one the other in Beauty and
Riches, wherein they come pretty near one the other, ex|cept
that of <HI>Antwerp,</HI> which exceeds the re&s;t; I can only
lament that &s;uch Noble Structures &s;hould be dedicated to
Idolatrous u&s;es. On the <HI>5th.</HI> we turned back to <HI>Combrogue,</HI>
where we remained as long as we could get any Forrage,
which was all devoured for Twenty Miles round, betwixt
the <HI>French</HI> Army and ours, I believe I may &s;ay Forty Miles,
without any great mi&s;take; at la&s;t there grew a real &s;carci|ty
of Hor&s;e meat. On the <HI>6th.</HI> Ten of the Grenadeers belong|ing
to our Guard, unadvi&s;edly went a Forraging without a
Convoy; Three of them were killed by the <HI>French,</HI> Five ta|ken
Pri&s;oners, and Two e&s;caped without Hor&s;es or Coats,
which they had pulled off to work and make up their Tru&s;&s;es.
The Pea&s;ant that belonged to the Hou&s;e where they For|raged,
brought the <HI>French</HI> upon them; but this action was
&s;ufficiently revenged on the <HI>French,</HI> by the <HI>Lunenburghers,</HI> who
being a Forraging with their Carbines only, were &s;et upon
by &s;ome <HI>French</HI> Soldiers di&s;gui&s;ed in <HI>Boors</HI> Frocks, but they
received them &s;o warmly, that they killed Eight and twenty
of them, and took about Seventy Pri&s;oners, with very little
lo&s;s. The day before we went to <HI>Monts,</HI> we marched a De|tachment
of Eight thou&s;and Men towards the <HI>French</HI> Camp,
together with Ten pieces of Cannon; when we came near
their Out-guards, we &s;ent a Lieutenant of Hor&s;e with Thir|ty
men to Fire on them, which he did, but they &s;tirred not,
neither returned their Fire: It was near a Wood, where it
is &s;uppo&s;ed they had an Ambu&s;cado, and thought to tra|pan
us; however this Alarum was &s;o great a &s;urprize unto
them, that &s;everal of their Sutlers run away from them,
and &s;everal of their Officers &s;ent away their Baggage: We
waited about Ten hours there to invite them to Engage
fairly, but they declined it; the next day they Decamped
and marched towards <HI>Tourney</HI> in order to &s;end their Troops
to Winter Quarters, and in a few days after we began to
<PB N="24" REF="15">
di&s;per&s;e our Army to the Frontier Garri&s;ons, to wit, <HI>Ath,
Monts, Mae&s;tricht, Gaunt, Charleroy, Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> &amp;c. in con|clu&s;ion
we marched towards <HI>Nevil,</HI> where we were di&s;charg|ed
at <HI>Nevil,</HI> on the when the Duke took his leave in
order to go for <HI>England,</HI> and the next day we marched, having
free Quarters all the way to <HI>Breda,</HI> to Winter Quarters;
where we arrived on the Twenty fourth, <MILESTONE N="24">  and met with an
account that the Granadeers who were taken by the <HI>French,</HI>
had made their e&s;cape to <HI>Newburgh,</HI> where they are taken up
as De&s;erters; but we have &s;ent for them, and in a &s;hort time
do expect them with us, where we now remain laid up for
the next Campain.</P>
