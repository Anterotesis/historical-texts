<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Die Martis, <HI>23.</HI> April, <HI>1695.</HI></DATE> In the <HI>Exchequer-Chamber.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>AT the Committee of both Hou&s;es, appointed to hear and examine Sir <HI>Tho. Cooke,</HI> in pur&s;uance of the Act, intituled, <HI>An Act to indemnifie Sir</HI> Thomas Cooke <HI>from Actions which he might be liable to, by rea&s;on of his di&s;covering to whom he paid and di&s;tributed &s;everal &s;ums of money therein men|tioned, to be received out of the Trea&s;ure of the</HI> Ea&s;t India <HI>Company; or for any pro&s;ecution for &s;uch distribution.</HI></P>
<DIV2 TYPE="deposition">
<P>Sir <HI>Thomas Cooke</HI> being called in, and the Act read, he thereupon ob&s;erved to the &s;aid Committee &s;ome|thing relating to the Clau&s;e touching his impri&s;on|ment; and did de&s;ire, that in ca&s;e he &s;hould then make a full and perfect di&s;covery, to the &s;atisfaction of the Committee, it might by them be repre&s;ented to each Hou&s;e, &s;o as he might obtain their Votes for his di&s;charge; he apprehending by the Act, that no per|&s;on is impowered to relea&s;e him in Ca&s;e of &s;uch di&s;covery. Whereupon the Committee acquainted him, <HI>That they were of Opinion, if he made a full di&s;|covery, he would not be liable to the Penalty of that Act; but however, his &s;cruple &s;hould he fairly repre&s;ented to both Hou&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>Thomas Cook</HI> being &s;worn, acquainted the Com|mittee, <HI>That for their ea&s;e he had put his Confe&s;&s;ion down in writing;</HI> a Copy whereof is hereunto annex|ed.</P>
<P>The Original being read by him, and the Com|mittee conceiving it to be imperfect, and not &s;uch as the Act requires, the Committee let him know, <HI>That they expected a more particular account of tho&s;e matters from him.</HI></P>
<P>To the fir&s;t Sum of 10000 l. mentioned in the &s;aid writing, he &s;aith, the &s;ame was payed to Mr. <HI>Ty&s;on</HI> in <HI>November</HI> 1692.</P>
<P>That he gave him no Directions how it &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed; but it was in expectation to have the Char|ter of the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Company confirmed, and New Regulations thereto made; and they concluded it for the &s;ervice of the Company. It was intended for the &s;ervice of the King, but he could not &s;ay the King had it.</P>
<P>He believes the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Company never had any account how this 10000 l. was di&s;po&s;ed. He told the Court, as he remembers, <HI>That he had dispo&s;ed of the mo|ney, and they required no account thereof.</HI></P>
<P>He believes Mr. <HI>Ty&s;on</HI> told him, that he delivered it to Sir <HI>Jo&s;ias Child,</HI> who delivered it to the King. He &s;aith, 'tis a Cu&s;tomary Pre&s;ent, and that in King <HI>Charles</HI>'s and other former Reigns the like had been done for &s;e|veral Years, which by the books of the Company may appear.</P>
<P>That the Company, when this Pre&s;ent was made, were in an ill condition; That he him&s;elf advanced this &s;um, and had it not repaid in 4 or 5 months time; the &s;ame, with the intere&s;t thereupon due, was pre&s;ented to the King in Tallies.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="2">
<P>As to the 10000 l. and 2000 l. next mentioned in the Account, he &s;aith, tho&s;e &s;ums were paid to Mr. <HI>Richard Acton</HI> about the &s;ame time; who declared he had &s;everal Friends capable of doing great &s;ervice to the Companies Affairs; and &s;everal of them would &s;peak with parliament-men; That he could not par|ticularize who they were, but the end aim'd at, was to get an <HI>Act of Parliament.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>Thomas Cook</HI> offer'd to give the Company an Ac|count how the mony was di&s;po&s;ed of, but they did not think fit to receive it. And further &s;aith, That he knows no man, be&s;ides Mr. <HI>Acton,</HI> who can give an Account who had that mony. That he intru&s;ted this mony wholly with Mr. <HI>Acton,</HI> taking him for an <HI>hone&s;t</HI> and <HI>able man,</HI> the Court having given him Power (as he conceiv'd) to di&s;po&s;e of the mony by another hand, as well as by his own.</P>
<P>That the inducements for giving this mony, were fears of the <HI>Interlopers</HI> going out, and <HI>Sub&s;criptions for a New Company going on,</HI> by which they <HI>apprehended pany would be ruin'd.</HI></P>
<P>That to the be&s;t of his Remembrance, there was a Bill at that time for another <HI>Ea&s;t-India Company;</HI> and that the King had &s;ent a <HI>Me&s;&s;age to the Hou&s;e of Com- the Commons</HI> to &s;ettle the <HI>Ea&s;t-India Trade.</HI></P>
<P>That this 10000 l. was Advanced by <HI>Acton</HI> him&s;elf, and not repayed him in &s;ome Months after, which <HI>mony,</HI> he believes, <HI>Acton</HI> paid away the &s;ame <HI>Se&s;&s;ion;</HI> the other 2000 l. to <HI>Acton,</HI> was for <HI>Interest</HI> and his <HI>Pains</HI> and <HI>Expences,</HI> which were great.</P>
<P><HI>Acton</HI> did &s;ay he could tell &s;ome Per&s;ons imployed in that <HI>Affair,</HI> he did under&s;tand that this Money was to be laid out <HI>for promoting their Affairs in Parliament,</HI> could not &s;ay to whom it was given, but under&s;tood <HI>it went no furnher than the Hou&s;e of Commons,</HI> and that he found no <HI>good Fruit by &s;uch Di&s;tribution.</HI></P>
<P>That Mr. <HI>Acton</HI> at that time had an <HI>intere&s;t in the Ea&s;t-India Company,</HI> to the value of 10 or 20000 l. as he believes, and had &s;o for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>That he gave this 10000 <HI>l.</HI> with the Privity of Sir <HI>Je&s;ias Child,</HI> who recommended <HI>Acton</HI> as a Per&s;on ca|pable of doing the <HI>Company Service,</HI> having <HI>great Ac|quaintance with Parliament Men, and others who had in|terest with them.</HI></P>
<P>That he knows not who <HI>Acton</HI> Employed in the <HI>di|&s;tribution of this Mony.</HI></P>
<P>As to the 338 l. 7. s. 6 d. mentioned to be paid to Mr. <HI>Molineaux,</HI> he &s;aith, the &s;ame was paid him about the &s;ame time the money was paid to Mr. <HI>A|cton;</HI> That Mr. <HI>Molineaux</HI> told him, <HI>this money was to be di&s;p &s;ed of to the Lord</HI> Rivers; but further &s;aith, <HI>that &s;ince his confinement</HI> Molineaux <HI>had been with him, to tell him, that it was a w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">ng thing; that my Lord ne|ver had it; that he had made u&s;e of it him&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>As to the farther Sum of 250 l. mentioned in the &s;aid Paper, to be paid Mr. <HI>Ty&s;on,</HI> for the &s;ervice of the <HI>Company;</HI> he &s;aith, <HI>it was paid him about the &s;ame time, and was in relation to</HI> Salt Petre, <HI>but he cannot give a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters"> further Account thereof.</HI></P>
<P>As to the 220l. mention'd to be paid to Sir <HI>John Chardin,</HI> he believes it was for his own u&s;e, having ex|pended great &s;ums in the Companies &s;ervice.</P>
<P>As to the 350l. paid to Mr. <HI>Dockminique,</HI> he &s;aith, <HI>He believes the &s;ame was Expended by him, but he knows, not to whom he gave it.</HI></P>
<P>As to the 382 l. 1 s. 8 d. paid to Capt. <HI>Jermain,</HI> he &s;aith; <HI>That Mr.</HI> Jermain <HI>told him he had lo&s;t</HI> 700 l. <HI>in the Intere&s;t of the Interlopers, who finding that Interest to decline, applied him&s;elf to him, the &s;aid Sir</HI> Thomas Cook, <HI>propo&s;ing that if he might have half the monies, which he had lost, repaid him, he would come into the</HI> Ea&s;t-India Company's <HI>Interest,</HI> upon which con&s;ideration the &s;aid 382 l. 1 s. 8 d. was paid him.</P>
<P>As to the 1091. l. 13 s. 4 d. paid to Mr. <HI>Fitzpatrick,</HI> Deceas'd, he &s;aith, <HI>That</HI> Fitzpatrick <HI>told him he had a great Interest with the Lord</HI> Nottingham, <HI>that he would try what he could do, and he did not doubt but he might ac|compli&s;h great Services, provided he might have &s;uch a Sum of Mony; but he believes the &s;aid</HI> Fitzpatrick <HI>kept the Money him&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>That there was a promi&s;e of a further Sum, if the intended Act of Parliament did not pa&s;s.</P>
<P>As to the 545 l. 16 s. 8 s. it was to be paid Mr. <HI>Charles Bates,</HI> when the Charter was &s;ettled, and was paid accordingly in <HI>October</HI> 1693. He him&s;elf had no acquaintance with him; but Sir <HI>Bazil Firebrace</HI> told him, <HI>He had acquaintance with &s;everal Lords, and named the Marque&s;s of</HI> Carmarthen, <HI>now Duke of</HI> Leeds.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t 10000 l. paid to Sir <HI>Ba&s;il Firebrace,</HI> it was paid him about <HI>Novemb.</HI> 1693. And it was always his apprehen&s;ion that Sir <HI>Bazil Firebrace</HI> kept it for him|&s;elf to recompence his Lo&s;&s;es in the <HI>Interloping Trade.</HI></P>
<P>As to the &s;everal other &s;ums which compleat the farther &s;um of 30000 l. paid to Sir <HI>Bazil,</HI> he &s;aith, <HI>They were paid at one time, tho depending upon &s;everal Contracts.</HI></P>
<P>That it was agreed, in ca&s;e the Charter pa&s;&s;ed, the Company, &s;hould take 60000 l. &s;tock of Sir <HI>Bazil Fire|brace,</HI> at 150 l. <HI>per Cent.</HI> When the Charter was pa&s;&s;ed, he put this &s;tock upon the Company at 150 <HI>l. per Cent;</HI> Their Stock was then at 100 l. <HI>per Cent.</HI> by which the Company lo&s;t 30000 l. He &s;aith, <HI>He never could tell to whom this mony was di&s;tributed; nor would Sir</HI> Bazil Firebrace <HI>give him an Account of that matter, tho often asked by him to do it; and Sir</HI> Bazil <HI>&s;aid, If he were farther pre&s;&s;ed, he would have no m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">re to do in it.</HI></P>
<P>That the Charter being pa&s;&s;ed, the <HI>Company</HI> paid the 30000 l. about <HI>January</HI> 1693. In recompence for the fall of the Stock, the Company was al&s;o to Transfer 40000 l. more Stock at 100 l. <HI>per Cent.</HI> if an Act pa&s;&s;ed in 18 Months for Confirming and inlarging their Charter; but the <HI>Act of Parliament</HI> not being pa&s;&s;ed, the Contract for that 40000 l. &s;tock became void.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Thomas Cook</HI> produc'd a Contract dated <HI>Sept.</HI> 19. 1693. which was mentioned to be made in con&s;idera|tion of 300 <HI>Guineas</HI> paid to him, which con&s;ideration he declared he had not Received.</P>
<P>He likewi&s;e produced another contract, dated <HI>Octob.</HI> 25. 1692.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="2">
<P>He &s;aith, <HI>There were &s;everal Contracts, &s;ome to the value of</HI> 6000 l. on account of Procuring a <HI>New Charter,</HI> and others, to the value of 40000 l. on ac|count of procuring an <HI>Act of Parliament;</HI> They were all in Sir <HI>Bazil Firebraces</HI> Name, one of each &s;ort by him produced to &s;hew the Nature of their Contracts.</P>
<P>He &s;aith, <HI>The</HI> 30000 <HI>l. was paid to Sir</HI> Bazil Fire|brace, <HI>or his Order, upon Ten &s;everal Contracts.</HI> It was paid in &s;ix &s;everal Sums, <HI>viz.</HI> 15 or 20000 l. (and he thinks 10000 l. a peice, becau&s;e no more than that &s;um can be &s;ub&s;cribed by one per&s;on) to <HI>Fowles</HI> and <HI>Wooton,</HI> to Mr. <HI>Edward Allen</HI> 5000 l. to Mr. <HI>Horneby</HI> 5000l. That the 30000 l. and 10000 l. were &s;ub&s;crib|ed into the <HI>East-India Company;</HI> and he believes the &s;ub&s;cribers can give better Information as to the&s;e &s;ums.</P>
<P>He did not know but the rea&s;on why the 30000 l. was in ten &s;everal contracts might be, becau&s;e Sir <HI>Ba|zil</HI> might have occa&s;ion to di&s;tribute it to &s;everal Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>As to the 90000 l. he &s;aith, <HI>That it was</HI> 99197 l. <HI>Stock bought for</HI> 90000 l. <HI>of &s;everal per&s;ons for the u&s;e of the Company, to make good the contracts with Sir</HI> Bazil, <HI>if he &s;hould choo&s;e to accept the Stock.</HI></P>
<P>That the Stock was transferr'd to &s;everal per&s;ons, to the Company's u&s;e; That he was accountable for it; That they had his own Obligation for the &s;ame; part of which &s;tock was transferr'd to the Company, other part was &s;old to their u&s;e, and they have the money.</P>

<P>It was agreed, that if the Duke did act in favour of the Company, he &s;hould have two or three thou&s;and Guineas, and <HI>Bates</HI> 500 Guineas to him&s;elf.

In the examination of the &s;aid matter, we do find that the Contracts upon the Guinea's given out as afore&s;aid, were made in the Names of Private Per|&s;ons, and not Members of the Company; that in tho&s;e Contracts no &s;uch Provi&s;ion was made as might Entitle the Company to the Benefit, had any ari&s;en by the &s;ame; but on the contrary, the &s;aid Con|tracts were never made known to the Court of Com|mittees, until &s;ome Months after the expiration of the time; &s;o that if there had ari&s;en any profit upon them, they might then have been applied to his proper Ac|count who had the negotiating of them; in con&s;ide|ration whereof it appeared to us, that tho&s;e Contracts did no way concern or oblige the Company; and un|der&s;tanding

<P>And al&s;o being inform'd that the Mony was not actually paid the 19th of <HI>November,</HI> we did, as we apprehended it our Duties to do in behalf of the Ge|neral Joint-&s;tock, u&s;e our endeavours as much as in us lay, to prevent the payment of the &s;aid Mony, by giving the following Intimation in writing to the Companies Officers, which was produced to the Court of Committees, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
