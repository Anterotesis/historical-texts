<HEAD>THE LIFE OF Admirall <HI>De Ruyter.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ARts in all ages have had their Chiefs and Grandecs, who by inventing of new, or improving of old devi|ces, have been e&s;teemed whil&s;t a|live, and renowned after death. And as their attempts were no o|therwi&s;e to be valued but as the prevailing <HI>genius</HI> of their times weighed the u&s;es of them &s;o &s;eve|ral ages according to their predo|minating mea&s;ures, have placed,
<PB N="2" REF="3">or di&s;placed their Arti&s;ts in the <HI>Cla&s;&s;is</HI> and Regi&s;ter of fame; which ought indeed to be the Royal Stan|dard of &s;uch Worthies prai&s;e; though fond Po&s;terity either over-affected with the advantages of their own, or not throughly in|formed of the u&s;efulne&s;s of elder-atchivements, do for the mo&s;t part unju&s;tly rank the Illu&s;trious of former times in that order; that the&s;e have the precedency who &s;eem mo&s;t to favour the preroga|tive of the pre&s;ent applauded pra|ctices: when antiquated contri|vances being tryed by a true &s;ur|vey of their profitablene&s;s when they Flouri&s;hed, and the advances they gained beyond their re&s;pe|ctive Predece&s;&s;ors, may appear to have made as high a ri&s;e above their antecedent hints, as our Great Guns excell the Roman bat|tering Rams, or our roaring Trumpet-&s;peaker, old bauling <HI>Sten|tor,</HI> who now with the great He|roes
<PB N="3" REF="3">of di&s;tant ages are &s;ent again to School,</P>
<Q><HI>&V;t pueris placeant &amp; declamatio fi|ant.</HI></Q>
<P>The Ma&s;ters of the Military Art as well as others, being obnoxious to this &s;evere and partiall Judge|ment, the contemporaries of great men have in all ages laboured to vindicate the honour of their He|roes, by bringing to a fair tryal of their Countrey, the attainments and feats of &s;uch as they (the only competent Judges) thought wor|thy to be li&s;ted in the Roll of Fame: and to crown them with &s;uch Verdant Bayes as nothing but a hotter &s;ea&s;on of newer attempts, and more taking di&s;coveries, could ever bla&s;t or wither: And as care|ful Navigators in coa&s;ting of new|found Lands, or Ingenious Pain|ters at the view of &s;ome rare and &s;urpri&s;ing beauty, fail not to make
<PB N="4" REF="4">&s;ome tran&s;ient de&s;ignes of the new objects; that either misfortune might not altogether deprive the world of them, or that the curio|&s;ity of others who &s;hould have bet|ter opportunities might be rai&s;ed to fini&s;h and compleat their in|tended draughts: So in all times &s;ome have been, who have left to po&s;terity the true and natural proportions and more di&s;cerna|ble lineaments of the actions of famous men, which others who lived nearer them might fill up and imbelli&s;h with the &s;everal colours and &s;haddows of &s;maller occurrences. Now &s;ince our Age hath brought forth as many (if not more) In&s;tances of this na|ture, then any pa&s;t, and rewar|ded them with as &s;uitable ho|nours and titles, as the mo&s;t tri|umphant times what&s;oever: I thought it not ami&s;&s;e at this time, when every little Ale and Coffee-hou&s;e <HI>Virtuo&s;o</HI> comes blu&s;tering
<PB N="5" REF="4">upon us from the pre&s;s; to give the world a view of the Life and Death of the late Renowned Sea-General <HI>Michael Ad. de Ruyter</HI> Lieutenant-Admiral of the States of the United Netherlands, who&s;e rare Endowments and memora|ble Exploits have rendred him parallel to his mo&s;t famed Com|petitors, and the high pitch to which he grew from &s;o low a root, more con&s;picuous then all: wherein if every little period of the &s;everal vici&s;&s;itudes and chan|ges of his fortune, be not &s;o di|&s;tinctly and punctually handled, as might be expected from an ex|act Diary, or <HI>Memoires</HI> (which is not the intent of this Treati&s;e;) yet the more ob&s;ervable Circum|&s;tances of his whole life, partly from Relations of his own mouth, and partly from the authentick Te|&s;timonies of Witne&s;&s;es &amp; Records, &s;hall be faithfully collected to the &s;atisfaction of every Reader.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="5">
<P>DUring the Wars betwixt the Spaniards and Dutch in <HI>Flan|ders,</HI> there &s;erved for &s;ome years the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> in quality of a private Trooper (a &s;tranger by &s;ome judged a &s;cotti&s;h man, &s;o little known by his family, that his profe&s;&s;ion gave him his Sir|name,) the happy Father of this brave man; who (being disban|ded from, or di&s;plea&s;ed with that cour&s;e of life;) with his wife, his only then childe <HI>Michael Ad. de Ruyter,</HI> born to him at <HI>Flu&s;hing</HI> in <HI>Zealand,</HI> (the &s;ubject of this pre&s;ent Di&s;cour&s;e,) and &s;erving|maid, being the whole of his Fa|mily, retired him&s;elf to a Coun|trey-hou&s;e at two miles di&s;tance from <HI>Bergen ap Zome,</HI> and there to the quieter employment of a husbandmans life: where by his indu&s;trous endeavours, with two hor&s;es, the greate&s;t part of his &s;ub&s;tance, in the u&s;uall labour
<PB N="7" REF="5">of that Countrey, he &s;upplied the wants of his family with care and pains: but neither the low|ne&s;s of the poor mans fortune (which commonly begets either contempt or pity) nor yet the priviledge of his per&s;on, as ha|ving &s;ometime &s;erved under the &s;ame En&s;ignes; could &s;ecure him or his bea&s;ts from the vio|lence of licentious Souldiers: his two hor&s;es are taken from him by force; and carried to the Dutch Camp in <HI>Flanders,</HI> by &s;ome of the Troopers of that Ar|my: this lo&s;s was too con&s;idera|ble to be neglected by him, who thereby &s;aw him&s;elf and family utterly ruined: He therefore ha|&s;tens after them to the camp; but finding his addre&s;&s;es for ju&s;tice fruitle&s;s, by the delays and neglect of the Officers, and being well ac|quainted with the proceedings of loo&s;ly di&s;ciplined or ill-paid Ar|mies, where the Commanders
<PB N="8" REF="6">either &s;hare in, or connive at the rapine of the Souldiers: he re&s;ol|ved on a &s;peedier and more effectu|al way of reparation, by &s;tealing from robbers what they had un|ju&s;tly forced from him: And &s;o having di&s;covered where his hor|&s;es were at gra&s;s, watching his opportunity, he &s;ecretly conveyed them away, and left them in a place &s;omewhat remote from his own hou&s;e, where he judged them farthe&s;t from danger, fore&s;eeing (as indeed it happened) that the&s;e new Ma&s;ters would not fail to look after the &s;trays. The &s;ouldiers mi&s;|&s;ing there booty, and concluding that the owner had them, returned in the night with a purpo&s;e to finde them at his hou&s;e; but being by his provident care di&s;appointed; in barbarous revenge they &s;et on fire the poor &s;ingle thatcht Cot|hou&s;e about the ears of the help|le&s;s Inhabitants; In the horrour of this &s;udden &s;urpri&s;e, whil&s;t

<PB N="10" REF="7">through &s;moke and flames, got into the upper Room, fir&s;t threw the childe out of the window in|to a &s;heet held by the father and maid to receive him, and after|ward jump't out her &s;elf, &s;aving from that little <HI>Troy</HI> her young <HI>Aeneas.</HI> So cro&s;s and unlucky are many times the beginnings of virtuous Men, and low the <HI>ba&s;is</HI> of Fames <HI>Pyramides,</HI> mi&s;ery being commonly the fir&s;t &s;tep to happine&s;s, and a gloomy morning the portal of a fair day: Having thus happily avoided the Fury of this cruel Element, though &s;tript of all, naked as truth it &s;elf, the di&s;con&s;olate Fa|ther in this &s;o great uncertainty, finding no other hopes of relief but the Charity of the Merciful, betook him&s;elf with his wretch|ed Family to <HI>Bergen ap Zome</HI> the next Town of Note, where arri|ving early in the morning, he pre&s;ented to his compa&s;&s;ionate
<PB N="11" REF="7">Countreymen a lamentable &s;pe|ctacle of his new di&s;a&s;ter:</P>
<P>The commendable care of that Countrey in providing for the Nece&s;&s;ities of the indigent, either by maintaining of the infirm and impotent, or by imploying the &s;tronger and tho&s;e that are able, to work: afforded means for the poor man to &s;ub&s;i&s;t and feed his family; untill his young &s;on being grown up to the &s;tate of a boy, able to do &s;omewhat for him&s;elf, was placed in the rope|ground of the Heer <HI>Lamp&s;on</HI> in <HI>Flu&s;hing,</HI> a con&s;iderable Mer|chant; who had a Manufactory of Ropes there: The poor childe complying with the condition which he could not alter, with &s;everal other boys of his own rank and age, dilligently follow|ed, his bu&s;ine&s;s in &s;pinning of rope-yarn, and other drudgeries of that vocation to the content of his Over&s;eers; until &s;ome time
<PB N="12" REF="8">after, the Heer <HI>Lamp&s;on</HI> him&s;elf coming into the rope-ground, and eying the lad; his fancy &s;ugge&s;ted to him (ob&s;erving the features and carriage of the boy) the un&s;uitablene&s;s of that trade to the <HI>genius</HI> of the lad: and finding upon examination the forwardne&s;s of his wit, and con|fident readine&s;s in his an&s;wers, and his willingne&s;s to leave that cour&s;e, and to &s;erve him in &s;ome other capacity; he relea&s;ed him from that &s;lavery, and &s;ent him to &s;chool; where in a &s;hort time he gave &s;uch pregnant proofs of his parts and indu&s;try, that his Ma&s;ter finding his pro|ficiency ripe for employment, prudently at fir&s;t intru&s;ted him with the charge of keeping of the accounts of his family-expen|ces, that &s;o he might the bet|ter have a tryal of the youths abilities, and prevent the er|rours, into which higher ad|vancement
<PB N="13" REF="8">and di&s;tance of place often mi&s;leads unexperienced be|ginners; imitating herein the example of Falconers, who u&s;e fir&s;t to call their hawks to their fi&s;ts with a guard, before they venture them at large to the lure: In this office he carried him&s;elf with &s;o great fidelity and di&s;cretion, and thereby gained &s;o great e&s;teem from his Ma&s;ter; that he advanced him to be his book-keeper, and to the management of his Mer|chant-affairs: wherein being likewi&s;e much &s;atisfied with his skill and diligence; he pitched upon him as a per&s;on every way qualified for a Factor in his trade in <HI>Ireland,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ted in but|ter, herrings, tallow and hides: and accordingly &s;ent him to <HI>Dublin;</HI> There he lived &s;even years under the in&s;pection of Mr <HI>Cremor,</HI> Mr <HI>Vanhorn,</HI> Mr <HI>Wi|born,</HI> and &s;ome others of his
<PB N="14" REF="9">Ma&s;ters Corre&s;pondents; during which &s;pace, be&s;ides his attain|ing of the Engli&s;h Tongue (ve|ry nece&s;&s;ary to him who was af|terward to treat &s;o often with the Engli&s;h in their own Lan|guage) he gave &s;o great proofs of his dexterity in the conduct of affairs of Trading, and of his faithfulne&s;s to his tru&s;t, and thereby &s;o much content to his Ma&s;ter and Corre&s;pondents; that by them he was &s;ent into the <HI>Streights,</HI> to negotiate as <HI>Supercargo</HI> of their Concerns there. And whil&s;t in his &s;everal Voyages from Port to Port in tho&s;e parts, he &s;ucce&s;sfully improved his traffick to the profit both of his Ma&s;ter and him&s;elf; being a na|tural enemy to idlene&s;s, and an Unactive life, and totally aver&s;e from the lazy and bruiti&s;h re|vellings of the mo&s;t part of Sea|men; he had lei&s;ure to rub up tho&s;e few impre&s;&s;ions and hints
<PB N="15" REF="9">of the Mathematicks, and parti|cularly Navigation, which he had learned when a boy: where|in by the ripene&s;s of his wit, his con&s;tant pains and &s;tudy, and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome Arti&s;ts, in a &s;hort time he made &s;uch lau|dable progre&s;s; that he not only became able to conduct any Ship him&s;elf, but obtained a great Name among&s;t Navigators. And having afterward made &s;everal Voyages into the <HI>Streights</HI> and <HI>Barbary,</HI> upon the account of the Heer <HI>Lamp&s;on</HI> his Ma&s;ter and Be|nefactor, with con&s;tant good for|tune and applau&s;e, he married a Widow, and &s;etled him&s;elf in <HI>Flu&s;hing</HI> in <HI>Zealand.</HI></P>
<P>The many good &s;ervices which he had performed to his Ma&s;ter, and the reputation gained in his Sea-expeditions, began to plain the way to his preferment: In the year 1650. the dayly dam|mages received from the <HI>Cor&s;airs</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="10">of <HI>Argiers,</HI> the enemies of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> being &s;o &s;en&s;ible, that thereby the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Trade, of great advantage to that Nati|on, was much ob&s;tructed: the States (for the &s;ecurity of their Merchants) re&s;olved to &s;end Convoys with their Ships: the Heer <HI>Lamp&s;on</HI> laying hold of this opportunity to &s;erve his Coun|trey, and at the &s;ame time to &s;how his love and gratitude to his friend, by the cheape&s;t, and yet mo&s;t noble way of reward; &s;o effectually recommended Mr <HI>De Ruyter</HI> to the <HI>States General,</HI> that he obtained for him a Com|mi&s;&s;ion to be Captain of a Man of War appointed by them, as a Convoy for their Merchant-men in the <HI>Streights,</HI> tho&s;e fatal Nar|row Seas, the Hercules-pillars of his life and honour, where he began and ended his Sea-prefer|ment; and gave the fir&s;t and la&s;t proofs of his Conduct and Va|lour.</P>
<PB N="17" REF="10">
<P>In this expedition he had the Occa&s;ion to lay the foundation of his future greatne&s;s, fir&s;t, by rendring him&s;elf remarkable in his Command, and next in his E&s;tate, the two u&s;ual handmaids of ri&s;ing fortunes: for as by his Valour and Conduct in many &s;ucce&s;sful Engagements with the&s;e Pirates, he procured the one, &s;o by his lawful and hone&s;t endeavours, he mi&s;&s;ed not of the other. In&s;omuch that his Name being grown publick in <HI>Holland,</HI> by the dayly characters of tho&s;e who had been obliged by his care and good offices; the States began to think him worthy of &s;ome higher rank.</P>
<P>The Occa&s;ion was not long wanting to his more pro&s;perous fortune, For in <HI>anno</HI> 1652. the equal &s;ucce&s;s of the two Neigh|bouring Common-wealths of <HI>England</HI> (then too unhappily e&s;tabli&s;hed) and the States of
<PB N="18" REF="11">the <HI>&V;nited Netherlands</HI> more deep|ly rooted; began to advance to the incompatible heighth of Su|periority (which was as much as Supremacy) their preten&s;ions on the Seas: And although their claims were as different as that of an old po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or from a new intruder; yet the younger Rival the <HI>Hollanders</HI> thinking their power not inferiour to the other, the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who upon the ac|count of long and uninterrup|ted po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, demanded of them the u&s;ual &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions: re&s;olved to di&s;pute the right by force of Arms, and &s;o broke forth a War; which for the eagerne&s;s of the parties, the frequency of engagements, and the undaun|ted con&s;tancy of the adver&s;aryes whil&s;t it la&s;ted; may ju&s;tly take place of all which before that time enobled the Ocean. Now was Captain <HI>Michael Adr. De Ruyter</HI> (&s;ignalized for his good
<PB N="19" REF="11">&s;ervices in the Mediterranean, and eyed by the States as a per|&s;on fit for greater action) called home: And whil&s;t Old Admiral <HI>Van Trump</HI> (after the engage|ment on the nineteenth of <HI>May,</HI> 1652. with General <HI>Blake</HI> off of <HI>Dover</HI>-rode, the fir&s;t action of ho&s;tility in this war, where he was defeated with the lo&s;s of two Ships and many men) was equipping and preparing in <HI>Hol|land</HI> his Fleet, and broom to &s;weep the Seas; <HI>De Ruyter</HI> with a &s;quadron of Fifty Men of War was &s;peeded out from <HI>Zealand,</HI> to Convoy the Merchant-men to the We&s;tward out of danger; and to &s;cowr the Seas of the Engli&s;h; who on that &s;ide rendred the Navigation un&s;afe: This great Fleet fir&s;t appearing off of <HI>Bright Ham&s;tead</HI> in <HI>Su&s;sex,</HI> where they forced a&s;hoar, and took &s;everal Barks, continued their cour&s;e We&s;tward by the back of
<PB N="20" REF="12">the <HI>I&s;le of Wight:</HI> Advice of this being brought to the pretended Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> Sir <HI>George Ay&s;cue</HI> who then Commanded a Fleet of fourty Men of War in the We&s;t about <HI>Plymouth;</HI> was ordered to &s;tretch over the Channel towards the Coa&s;t of <HI>France,</HI> to hinder, or at lea&s;t di&s;pute them their pa&s;&s;age: this he accordingly obeying, on the &s;ixth of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1652. the two Fleets came in &s;ight; and about four in the afternoon, to blows; and here continued a &s;harp Fight, bravely maintained on both &s;ides, till &s;eparated by night, both lay by: But <HI>De Ruyters</HI> chief bu&s;ine&s;s being to &s;ecure his Merchant-men, and Sir <HI>George</HI> not thinking it conveni|ent to renew the Engagement: he carried off his Fleet without lo&s;s of a Ship.</P>
<P>The States acquainted with his good Conduct in this Fir&s;t Ex|pedition,
<PB N="21" REF="12">appointed him his &s;ta|tion in the mouth of the Chan|nel, to &s;top and &s;eize all Engli&s;h Ships homeward or outward|bound: There he di&s;charged an Engli&s;h Ship that he had taken, upon condition that the Ma&s;ter &s;hould acquaint Sir <HI>George Ay&s;cue,</HI> that he &s;tayed for him, and would be glad to &s;ee him: but Sir <HI>George</HI> knowing well the prudence and valour of the Commander, and the humour of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> not ra&s;h to run any apparent risk on|ly for o&s;tentation of bravery, his own Fleet being inferior in num|ber; and having received no new Orders from his Ma&s;ters; returned no an&s;wer: This brisk carriage won <HI>De Ruyter</HI> a &s;ingu|lar reputation of gallantry and good conduct from the States-Ge|neral, but in particular manner from the States of <HI>Zealand:</HI> In this &s;tation he continued crui&s;ing, till <HI>De Witt</HI> with another con&s;i|derable
<PB N="22" REF="13">Fleet from <HI>Holland</HI> joyn|ed him, on the Twenty fourth of <HI>September;</HI> and having recei|ved &s;ix Plate &s;hips with their convoy whom they expected from <HI>Cadiz,</HI> they both together &s;et &s;ail homewards.</P>
<P>General <HI>Blake</HI> returning with the Engli&s;h Fleet from <HI>Plymouth</HI> towards the <HI>Downs,</HI> di&s;covered the Dutch Fleet commanded by <HI>De Witt</HI> and <HI>De Ruyter</HI> riding at the back of the <HI>Goodwin-Sands,</HI> after that they had &s;ent their charge into <HI>Holland; Blake</HI> re&s;ol|ved to have engaged them, but the winde blowing hard hindred his attempt then untill afterward; the &s;ea&s;on being more favourable on the Twenty eighth of <HI>October,</HI> with three Squadrons of Ships he made up to them; but fin|ding them &s;o well protected by the Sands among&s;t which they rode, and having run aground the <HI>So|veraign</HI> and <HI>Re&s;olution,</HI> (which
<PB N="23" REF="13">were pre&s;ently got off again) in his too ra&s;h approach with the great Ships, he was forced to de|&s;i&s;t. <HI>De Witt</HI> and <HI>De Ruyter</HI> in the entry of a War being a&s;hamed thus to be braved, voluntarily left their advantagious &s;tation, came forth and fought the Eng|li&s;h; but with &s;o great lo&s;s, that notwith&s;tanding all the cou|rage and conduct employed by the two Admiralls during the action, they were forced to run, leaving many Ships burnt and &s;unk; and were pur&s;ued by the Engli&s;h within twelve Leagues, E. S. E. of the <HI>Maes,</HI> on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Holland;</HI> till with the remainder of the Fleet &s;hattered and torn <HI>de Wit</HI> and <HI>de Ruyter</HI> got into <HI>Goree.</HI> The <HI>Hollanders</HI> im|puted their ill &s;ucce&s;&s;e in this Fight to the over-match of the Engli&s;h, and the cowardi&s;e of &s;ome of their Captains, who did not fight; but experience hath
<PB N="24" REF="14">&s;ince demon&s;trated, that the pru|dent u&s;e which the cautious <HI>De Ruyter</HI> made of the misfortune, was never to for&s;ake an advantagi|ous &s;tation till a more advantagious opportunity of fighting offfered.</P>
<P>This Defeat &s;purr'd the <HI>Dutch</HI> on revenge: For on the Nine and twentieth of <HI>November</HI> following, old <HI>Van Trump</HI> and Vice-Admiral <HI>De Ruyter</HI> with a Fleet of Eighty Men of War, and Ten Fire-&s;hips put to Sea again, and finding Ge|neral <HI>Blake</HI> at his &s;tation with a number far inferiour, not much exceeding fourty Sail, but with equal re&s;olution to fight: <HI>Van Trump</HI> and <HI>De Ruyter</HI> made up towards him, and he not &s;hrinking, there began a hot and bloudy combat, ob&s;tinatly maintained for &s;ome time; but the di&s;parity of num|ber being unrea&s;onably great, the Engli&s;h were routed, and the Garland-Frygat taken: In this Fight <HI>De Ruyter</HI> &s;u&s;tained much

<P>About the end of this year 1666. the Dutch being weary of the va&s;t expences, and weakned by the great lo&s;&s;es of the war, and the Engli&s;h much di&s;heart|ned by the burning of the City of <HI>London,</HI> which happened in <HI>September;</HI> both &s;eemed inclina|nable to an accomodation; and overtures of peace thereupon be|gan to be &s;et on foot on either

<P>In the beginning of the Spring <HI>De Ruyter</HI> was again &s;peeded out to Sea, and in <HI>April</HI> 1667, made an attempt with a good Fleet upon Brunt-I&s;land, a Town in the Scotti&s;h firth, intending to have landed and &s;poyled the Countrey; but by the vigilant care, and conduct of the Earl of <HI>Rothoes,</HI> Chancellour of that Kingdom, with the Trained Bands of the Countrey, he was bravely repul&s;ed with lo&s;s.</P>
<P>After this, <HI>De Ruyter</HI> to amu&s;e the Engli&s;h (who in a &s;mall Fleet were at &s;ea) &s;ent off a detach|ment of twenty five &s;ail of &s;hips to crui&s;e to the Northward, who on the third of <HI>June</HI> falling in with Nineteen Sail of Engli&s;h Frigats off of <HI>Hull,</HI> began a furi|ous and bloudy conflict, which was &s;o &s;toutly and ob&s;tinately

<P>Shortly after he made an at|tempt upon &s;ome Neighbouring parts of <HI>Harwich,</HI> having put a|&s;hoar three thou&s;and men near <HI>Fel&s;ton-cliff,</HI> and commanded two thou&s;and of them to make an a&s;|&s;ault upon <HI>Langward-Fort,</HI> which was twice e&s;&s;ayed, the fir&s;t la&s;t|ing about three quarters of an hour, and the other one quarter; but at la&s;t with the lo&s;&s;e of an hun|dred men, they were forced to retreat in &s;o much ha&s;te and di&s;|order, that they left behinde them all their ladders: while&s;t the&s;e a|ctions continued at <HI>Langward-fort,</HI> a party of twelve hundred <HI>Dutch</HI> being po&s;ted at the cliff their lan|ding-place, to &s;ecure and make good their retreat, were attack|ed by the Trained Bands of the Countrey under the Command of

<P>The day following this defeat at <HI>Langward-Fort, de Ruyter</HI> with the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet was pur&s;ued by Sir <HI>Edward Spragg</HI> and Sir <HI>Jo&s;eph Jordan</HI> with about twenty &s;ail of &s;mall Frigats; but whether <HI>De Ruyter</HI> finding his Orders limited, or for the rea&s;ons above-hinted, notwith&s;tanding he had a much &s;tronger Fleet, kept at di&s;tance, and carefully avoided engage|ment; taking his cour&s;e through the channell for the We&s;tern parts of <HI>England:</HI> In his pa&s;&s;age he ap|peared before <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> but
<PB N="58" REF="31">knowing the &s;trength of the place, and finding the Countrey in arms, he only &s;hewed him&s;elf there, and &s;o continued his voyage to the We&s;tern coa&s;ts.</P>
<P>In <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> he endeavoured to have landed &s;ome men at <HI>Wen|bury,</HI> but the Militia of the Coun|trey being ready to receive them, &s;o warmly &s;aluted them with &s;ome Volleys of &s;mall &s;hot, that they were forced with all &s;peed to betake them&s;elves back again to their &s;hips. The Admiral de|&s;pairing to effect any thing here by force, &s;ent off a boat with a white flag, de&s;iring leave to come a&s;hoar to buy fre&s;h provi&s;ions, but it was denied him by the Gen|tlemen and Officers that com|manded there; alledging that no &s;uch permi&s;&s;ion could be granted without the con&s;ent and autho|rity of the Commander in chief, who then was ab&s;ent: <HI>De Ruyter</HI> in this manner di&s;appointed of

<P>By this time <HI>De Ruyter</HI> being informed from <HI>Holland</HI> of the progre&s;s of the Treaty of Peace, which now was in a tendency to a &s;peedy conclu&s;ion, not willing with new ho&s;tilities to retard that which was &s;o heartily de&s;ired by both parties; relented a little in the ardour of his proceedings, and began to heal the wounds which he had formerly made, by
<PB N="60" REF="32">prudent application of the poli|tick plai&s;ters of nece&s;&s;ity and ig|norance; excu&s;ing &s;ome ho&s;tili|ties, as thereto enjoyned by his Commi&s;&s;ion, and others as com|mitted without his Order: And to that purpo&s;e &s;ent off two of|ficers with a flag of truce, who being brought before Sir <HI>Jonathan Trelawny,</HI> who commanded in chief under the Earl of <HI>Bath</HI> in the&s;e parts, and having made the complement and apologies of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">dmiral, de&s;ired in his name a conference with &s;ome Engli&s;h aboard, for who&s;e &s;afe coming and returning, he was ready to engage the faith of the Seven Provinces. Sir <HI>Jonathan</HI> having herewith advi&s;ed the Earl of <HI>Bath,</HI> by his Order <HI>De Ruyter</HI> was vi&s;ited aboard of his own Ship, by the &s;ame Sir <HI>Jonathan Trelawny,</HI> Major <HI>Sparks,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Windham.</HI> The Admiral upon their approach courteou&s;ly came
<PB N="61" REF="32">over his Ships-&s;ide, met, and re|ceived them in their boat, where after mutuall &s;alutations, having renewed the Apologies formerly made by his me&s;&s;engers; he in|vited them aboard, received them with a &s;alute of Ordinance, and entertained them with the Chief Officers of his Fleet at a mag|nificent dinner in the great Cabbin: During which he gave honourable demon&s;trations of love and e&s;teem for their per|&s;ons, and frequently repeated the expre&s;&s;ions of the great ho|nour he had for his Maje&s;ty and Kingdom of <HI>England;</HI> and real and hearty wi&s;hes for a &s;olid and permanent corre&s;pondence be|twixt both Nations, lamenting the great damages and lo&s;s which acorued to both by &s;o ruinating a War. The Engli&s;h entertained his civilities with reciprocal returns of honour and kindene&s;s, and having offered
<PB N="62" REF="33">him &s;upplies of all nece&s;&s;ary pro|vi&s;ions for his own Table, refu|&s;ing more untill the peace &s;hould be concluded; they took their leave, having been fir&s;t a&s;&s;ured by him, that no more hurt &s;hould be done to the Countrey whil&s;t he remained on the&s;e Coa&s;ts. The Earl of <HI>Bath</HI> after|ward pre&s;ented him with &s;uch provi&s;ions and nece&s;&s;aries, as the Countrey and &s;ea&s;on of the year afforded; which he courteou&s;ly received, and in &s;igne of grati|tude fired &s;everal guns, and &s;o departed: but notwith&s;tanding the promi&s;es of indemnity gi|ven, after his departure from <HI>Plymouth,</HI> two of his Fleet, ad|vancing toward <HI>Foy,</HI> for &s;ome time lay annoying and battering the harbour and &s;hoar with great &s;hot, till having received dammage in their hulls, and one of them having lo&s;t his main topma&s;t, they de&s;i&s;ted and went
<PB N="63" REF="33">off; whether this was by the Generals Order or not, is not known; there having been no enquiry ever made in the action, by rea&s;on of the peace that im|mediatly followed; but it is be|lieved that <HI>De Ruyter</HI> had no hand in it.</P>
<P>This long expected Peace con|cluded at <HI>Breda</HI> the 21 of <HI>June,</HI> and at length the 14th of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1667. ratified in <HI>England,</HI> rather by the exigency and nece&s;&s;ity of the times, than the intire and full &s;atisfaction of both parties, as appeared within few years af|terward, gave re&s;pite to both Nations to breathe a little, and recruit their mutual pa&s;t lo&s;&s;es by indu&s;trious pro&s;ecuting their traffick, the hugg'd darling of both people: and to con&s;ider in cold blood what had been done ami&s;&s;e by either &s;ide, during the War, that from &s;o &s;ea&s;onable a peace, they might pick the ne|ce&s;&s;ary
<PB N="64" REF="34">means of future reparati|on. And now <HI>De Ruyter</HI> having &s;afely reconducted his Fleet into harbour, was received by the States with thanks and honours &s;uitable to his merit, and with the univer&s;al acclamations and applau&s;e of the Countrey; and was judged by all di&s;creet men to have under&s;tood as well the mea&s;ures of a General in that Common-wealth as any who|&s;oever, by his never giving way to the tran&s;ports of vain|glory, or rage in the heat of action, but by timely retreat or advantagious fighting; like the Roman <HI>Fabius Maximus, Cunctan|do re&s;tituit rem.</HI></P>
<P>The States having now no more need of &s;o eminent a Com|mander at &s;ea, the great and dreadfull War being over, but occa&s;ion &s;till of a wi&s;e and pra|cti&s;ed State&s;man at home; ad|mitted the <HI>Heer De Ruyter</HI> with
<PB N="65" REF="34">no le&s;s expectation into their Councils of difficult affairs, then they had formerly impowred him as General at &s;ea: wherein he &s;o an&s;wered their hopes; that during the four years peace, or rather ce&s;&s;ation of arms betwixt <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> he gave &s;o &s;ignal proofs of his prudence, that they were only fain to di&s;|pence with his being at home; becau&s;e they could not finde a Succe&s;&s;our for him abroad which the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e of the year 1672. ur|gently required.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> King in <HI>anno</HI> 1671. with a con&s;iderable army came to <HI>Dunkirk</HI> in <HI>Flanders,</HI> this progre&s;&s;e in a time of peace being accom|panied with great preparations for War, gave apprehen&s;ions to all his Neighbours, but e&s;pecial|ly to the States of the United Provinces, who &s;u&s;pecting that his approach &s;o near them, was to &s;hew them the rod with

<P>On the thirteenth of <HI>January,</HI> two parties meeting, and the Dutch refu&s;ing to &s;trike, there followed an engagement, and this fir&s;t blow being thus given,

<P>The States of <HI>Holland</HI> fore&s;ee|ing the &s;torm which now began to break upon them, had &s;o for|tified them&s;elves with the pow|erfull alliances of <HI>Spain, Germany,</HI> and <HI>Denmark,</HI> that they &s;eemed not unequally matched with their mighty enemies in &s;o great a conjunction: &s;o that in the year 1672. the greate&s;t part of the States of Chri&s;tendome be|came involved in a bloody and

The brave Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> who was re&s;olved to pawn his life for his honour, being engaged in the middle of the <HI>Dutch</HI> with a few &s;hips; the <HI>Soveraign,</HI> and others of his Squadron, having &s;tood off to gain the weather-gage, and the Duke in hot action with <HI>De Ruyter,</HI> overpowerd with a number of men of War and fire|&s;hips, and a hardy Dutch Cap|tain <HI>Adrian Brackell,</HI> having laid him aboard athwart the ha&s;s; yet &s;till continued the fight with &s;uch un&s;haken courage, that he &s;unk two of three of the fire|&s;hips that had grapled with him, and forced the Dutch Captain to call for quarter: but at la&s;t his &s;hip being unhappily fired by a third Fire&s;hip, was burnt, and he him&s;elf with many per&s;ons of quality bravely, but unfortu|nately
<PB N="75" REF="39">peri&s;hed; to the grief of the King his Ma&s;ter, and un|&s;peakable regret of his Coun|trey; having left to po&s;terity an immortal proof, that Valour crowned with honour, does not &s;hrink, but &s;wells by its reward. <HI>Haddock</HI> his Captain though wounded, e&s;caped by &s;wimming, till he was taken up. This hap|pened in the afternoon, when tho&s;e &s;hips of the blew-&s;qua|dron, that had &s;tood off, having got the winde, bore down upon the Dutch, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Duke who pre&s;&s;ed <HI>De Ruyter</HI> &s;o &s;traitly, that towards the even|ing he gave way, and &s;tood o|ver for the Dutch Coa&s;t, and was pur&s;ued by the Duke all night. In this Engagement be|&s;ides the lo&s;&s;e of the Noble Earl of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> and his &s;hip, the <HI>Henry</HI> and <HI>Royall Catherine,</HI> two great &s;hips on the Engli&s;h &s;ide were taken, Captain <HI>Dighy</HI>

On the Dutch &s;ide, Ad|miral <HI>Van Ghent</HI> was &s;lain, mo&s;t of their great &s;hips mi&s;erably torn, and two of them &s;unk, and one of fourty eight guns Captain <HI>Elder&s;on</HI> of <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> Commander taken, many more were mi&s;&s;ing, of which no parti|cular account can be given. The <HI>Dutch</HI> with confidence plea&s;ed them&s;elves to brag of a Victory with the accu&s;tomed &s;olemnities of rejoycing; and imputed much of the Engli&s;h lo&s;s to the French &s;eperating from the re&s;t of the Fleet that day, about noon; but it is certain that the Duke ha|ving pur&s;ued them to their own Coa&s;t, and having next day in vain offered battel, kept the
<PB N="77" REF="40">&s;eas, and could bring them to no more action this year.</P>
<P>The advice of the prevailing progre&s;s of the <HI>French</HI> on the one hand, and the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> on the other, which put the States in much apprehen&s;ion, and the people in great fright and confu&s;ion; being brought to <HI>De Ruyter,</HI> as he rode with his Fleet at the Oy&s;ter-bank; oc|ca&s;ioned his ha&s;tening from thence to <HI>Blanckenburgh,</HI> there to put a&s;hoar a great part of his men to be employed at land, where the danger then &s;eemed mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing: And whil&s;t he continued there with a Fleet half mann'd to &s;ecure the arri|val of the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Fleet, which was then look't for; the <HI>Duke of York</HI> kept at &s;ea, &s;ometime crui&s;ing, &s;ometime at anchor on the <HI>Doggerbank,</HI> in very bad weather, with intention either to &s;eize that Fleet, or to pro|voke
<PB N="78" REF="41">voke the Dutch to a New En|gagement by their attempting to defend them. About this time the tumult of the untractable people who imputed all their ca|lamities to the errours of their Governours, grew every where &s;o high, that it &s;eemed to threa|ten a di&s;&s;olution of Government; e&s;pecially at <HI>Dort,</HI> where the <HI>Burghers</HI> armed in a great body having &s;urrounded the hou&s;e where the <HI>Prince of Orange</HI> &s;ate at dinner, with the Magi&s;trates of the place; &s;ent &s;ome of their Officers with a form of writing, containing a New Election of his Highne&s;&s;e to be hereditary Stat|holder of the Common-wealth, with a renunciation of all mali|cious Acts and Edicts made by the <HI>Love&s;tein</HI> faction to the con|trary; threatning the Magi&s;trates with the lo&s;&s;e of their lives, un|le&s;&s;e they pre&s;ently &s;igned it: This peremptory de&s;ire the Magi&s;trates

<P>In the rage of this unruly multitude <HI>De Ruyter</HI> him&s;elf there celebrated tutelary and guardian, though then at &s;ea, for their de|fence hardly e&s;caped their fury; for a company of common peo|ple having mutined into a body be&s;et his hou&s;e in the New I&s;land of <HI>Am&s;terdam;</HI> and if they had not been hindred by the Magi|&s;trates
<PB N="80" REF="42">had plundered and &s;ackt it: this was &s;o &s;trange when no previous &s;et di&s;cour&s;e (that is known) did winde up the Jack to &s;uch a revolution; that it af|fords us another ea&s;y and obvi|ous remark, that men when they are mad, are never wi&s;e.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>York</HI> having for many weeks kept his &s;tation, and &s;uffered very foul weather on the <HI>Dogger-bank;</HI> and <HI>De Ruyter</HI> at <HI>Blanckenburgh,</HI> without any of|fer of fighting; the long wi&s;hed for <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Fleet (which the Duke hoped might give occa&s;ion to a new tryal) at length ap|peared near the Coa&s;t of <HI>Holland.

<PB N="81" REF="42">&s;hoar, without being di&s;covered by the Engli&s;h; met the Fleet, and &s;afely conducted them into <HI>Delfzey</HI> in the <HI>We&s;t-Emms.</HI> The <HI>Cambridge</HI> and <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> two Eng|li&s;h Frigats, being then upon the &s;cout, came up with them, and had &s;ome little encounter; but the windes was high, and the &s;ea &s;o rough, that no booty could be gained. The Duke having now lo&s;t all hopes of alluring the <HI>Dutch</HI> to any more action this year, left Sir <HI>Edward Spragg</HI> with a &s;qua|dron of &s;hips to keep the &s;eas, and di&s;turb their fi&s;hing, and he him|&s;elf with the re&s;t of the fleet re|turned home.</P>
<P>The torrent of the French con|que&s;ts at land being now &s;ome|what &s;topt, and the tumult and, rage of the people quieted, the affairs of Sea came next in play; In the preparations for which, the vigilant <HI>De-Ruyter</HI> with much diligence employed the winter
<PB N="82" REF="43">(which happened by rea&s;on of its openne&s;s, to be very favourable to the <HI>Dutch</HI>) propo&s;ing to him|&s;elf rea&s;onable advantages, if he could have a Fleet in readine&s;s next &s;pring at Sea, before the coming of the <HI>French,</HI> which he effected. For in <HI>May</HI> 1673. with a &s;trong and well-appointed Na|vy commanded by him&s;elf, <HI>Van Trump</HI> and <HI>Banckert,</HI> he was out again at Sea, and in the mouth of the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> with de|&s;igne, by &s;inking of &s;everal great Ships in the narrow pa&s;&s;ages of the Channel, called the <HI>Middle|ground,</HI> to have &s;topped and blockt up the mouth and entry of the river; but the breadth of that channel, and the commodiou&s;ne&s;s of others, rendred his attempts al|together in vain.</P>
<P>Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> who for this Years Expedition Commanded the Royal Navies, lying at the <HI>Buoy of the Nore,</HI> with part
<PB N="83" REF="43">of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> fleet (the <HI>French</HI> being not as yet arrived) when <HI>De Ruyter</HI> appeared, was hindred by the windes to get out; but afterwards having with much dif|ficulty put to Sea, and made to|wards the <HI>Dutch: De Ruyter</HI> not &s;werving from his former mea|&s;ures, thinking he gained enough when he did not lo&s;e, warily re|tired behinde the banks, tho&s;e impregnable &s;ea-ramparts, &s;hun|ning at that time any engagement: The Prince &s;eeing this, &s;tood with his fleet for the <HI>Streights</HI> off <HI>Calais,</HI> with intention to meet the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> fleets; whom af|ter a &s;hort &s;tay, he having joyned at <HI>Dungean ne&s;s,</HI> with the whole fleet, returned for the coa&s;t of <HI>Holland,</HI> and <HI>May</HI> 26. 1673. arrived before <HI>Schonvelt</HI> where <HI>de Ruyter</HI> lay with his fleet.</P>
<P>The winde and Sea then un&s;ea|&s;onable, allowed no fair opportu|nity of fighting, but the twenty
<PB N="84" REF="44">eighth in the morning, the wea|ther fair, and a fre&s;h gale, invi|ted the Prince to action: <HI>De Ruy|ter</HI> &s;till kept his &s;tation where the great &s;hips could not approach: and the Prince re&s;olving by all means po&s;&s;ible to draw him to an engagement, &s;ent off thirty five &s;ail of &s;mall Frigats to provoke him to battel: The <HI>Dutch</HI> con|trary to the expectation of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI> in excellent order came forth, and boldly en|countred this Van-guard of the fleet with &s;uch hot &s;ervice, that they being forced a little to yield, di&s;ordered the re&s;t of the Royal Navy: The fight continued de&s;|perately on both &s;ides, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI> with mutuall emula|tion behaving them&s;elves brave|ly, and with &s;o much eagerne&s;s, that they entangled each other, and gave &s;ome advantage to the enemy: For the Valiant Earl of <HI>O&s;&s;ory</HI> being pe&s;tered among&s;t the
<PB N="85" REF="44"><HI>French,</HI> ran foul of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fregat, and was entangled with a fire&s;hip; and was no &s;ooner got clear, but the ob&s;ervant <HI>De Ruyter</HI> laying hold of the oppor|tunity, bore down upon him with his whole Squadron, and gave him fre&s;h occa&s;ion to &s;igna|lize his Valour: The Earl with his &s;hips that were with him, received the Admirall with no le&s;s re&s;olution then he was at|tacqued, and maintained a bloudy fight, with equal &s;ucce&s;s, till both being &s;ufficiently battered, the night put an end to the con|flict, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> returned to their lurking holes: In this Fight <HI>de Ruyter</HI> lo&s;t only the Ship called the <HI>Debenter,</HI> and had killed the Vice-Adm&s;ral <HI>Schram,</HI> Rear-Ad|miral <HI>Ulugh,</HI> and &s;ix Captains: After the old manner both Par|ties claimed the honour of the Victory; The <HI>Dutch</HI> becau&s;e they had repul&s;ed the A&s;&s;ailants, and
<PB N="86" REF="45">the Engli&s;h becau&s;e they had for|ced the <HI>Dutch</HI> to their banks of re|fuge; but both fleets were much damnified.</P>
<P>The next three days were &s;pent in mending and re-fitting their &s;hattered &s;hips, which the <HI>Dutch</HI> had better opportunity to perform (having all nece&s;&s;aries from their &s;tores at hand) then the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who were &s;o remote from their own Coa&s;t; So that <HI>de Ruyter</HI> knowing well the advantage, in the begining of <HI>Iune</HI> put out again, and by his approach allarmed the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who had not as yet got into &s;uch readine&s;s; yet notwith|&s;tanding they pre&s;ently put them|&s;elves in a po&s;ture of engaging, ob&s;erving the motion of the <HI>Dutch;</HI> which <HI>de Ruyter</HI> perceiving drew all his fleet into a line, reaching three leagues, and &s;o came to an anchor, expecting the coming unto the fleet of the <HI>Heers Bo&s;cho|velt, Van der Meyden, Moregnault,</HI>
<PB N="87" REF="45">and <HI>Van der Vier&s;e</HI> the Deputies of the States General; who being arrived and in a Council of War having approved his intent of fighting, and afterward return|ed again a&s;hoar; on the fourth of <HI>June, De Ruyter</HI> with his whole Fleet, was by eleven of the clock again under &s;ail, mak|ing directly towards the Eng|li&s;h, who kept their old &s;tati|on. Sir <HI>Edward Spragg</HI> Admiral of the Engli&s;h blew &s;quadron, who had the Van, not believing that the Dutch intended to fight, but only as before to change their rode; made no great ha&s;te to bear up, and &s;o lo&s;t the winde; and being much pre&s;&s;ed by the <HI>French,</HI> as they by the Prince in the rear, who were all ea|ger to come to blows; he was put in &s;ome little di&s;order. The two Fleets for &s;ome time fought &s;toutly, e&s;pecially where the Earl of <HI>O&s;&s;ory</HI> and Sir <HI>Edward
<PB N="88" REF="46">Spragg</HI> engaged, till the Prince finding the di&s;advantage of the winde, with the red and white &s;quadrons &s;tood away <HI>N W. De Ruyter</HI> thinking it was to get the winde, which he was not wil|ling to lo&s;e, did the like, and left <HI>Van Trump</HI> with the re&s;t of the Fleet in a &s;harp conflict with <HI>Spragg</HI> and <HI>O&s;&s;ory.</HI> The day began to clo&s;e before the &s;hot on either &s;ide betwixt the Prince and <HI>De Ruyter</HI> began to do exe|cution: but at length the Eng|li&s;h mu&s;t confe&s;s, that to their great wonder, they fir&s;t learned here, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> powder was &s;tronger and the guns longer than their own. So Prince <HI>Ru|pert</HI> having &s;hifted him&s;elf from the <HI>Royal Charles</HI> into the <HI>Old Soverain,</HI> and Sir <HI>Edward Spragg</HI> rejoyned the Fleet, they fought at di&s;tance mo&s;t part of the night, and by break of day both Fleets being out of &s;ight of each
<PB N="89" REF="46">other, the Prince with the lo&s;s of many men, and di&s;abled &s;hips, made for the <HI>Thames;</HI> and <HI>De Ruyter</HI> with little lo&s;s having had the advantage of the winde and a di&s;tant fight, &s;tood back for his old &s;tation on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Zeland. De Ruyter</HI> in this acti|on gave evident proof that he knew when it was time to pur|&s;ue as well as retreat, and that he never turned his back but with intent to &s;hew his face.</P>
<P>It was now the twentieth of <HI>July</HI> before the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI> were in condition again to vi&s;it the <HI>Dutch</HI> Coa&s;ts, and then ha|ving di&s;covered <HI>De Ruyter</HI> with his Fleet eight leagues off of the Coa&s;t of <HI>Zealand,</HI> and in po&s;ture of Fighting, the Royall Navy expected an Engagement, but wi&s;e <HI>De Ruyter</HI> who always fought after his own manner, knew well the importance of &s;o great a triall, and that the affairs
<PB N="90" REF="47">of his Countrey &s;o embarra&s;&s;ed on all hands, did not require the hazarding of the intere&s;t and honour of his Ma&s;ters, or of him&s;elf, without &s;ome probable hopes of &s;aving of both; &s;tood in nearer the &s;hoar, and bore a|way along the Coa&s;t, declining all engagement untill the one and twentieth of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> follow|ing.</P>
<P>On the twentieth of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> being informed that the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet were about <HI>Goree,</HI> made thither, and towards the evening di&s;covered them: but being then late, thought be&s;t not to attacque them that night: In the mean time <HI>De Ruyter</HI> according to his ordinary conduct improving the benefit of the darkne&s;s, &s;tood in clo&s;e to the &s;hoar, and bearing up before next morning, gained the winde of the Engli&s;h, and by &s;even of the Clock bore down
<PB N="91" REF="47">upon them fre&s;hly. The <HI>Prince</HI> upon this, changing his cour&s;e, &s;tood away S.

Sir <HI>Edward Spragg</HI> and <HI>Van Trump</HI> (the two
<PB N="92" REF="48">declared Competitiours and Ri|vals for honour) with their &s;qua|drons in the mean time per&s;i&s;ted in action with &s;uch determinate re&s;olution, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> avow the like never to have been &s;een, their own two &s;hips having without touching of a &s;ail &s;trangely endured the fury of three full hours unce&s;&s;ant batte|ry. But Sir <HI>Edward Spraggs</HI> Ship the <HI>Prince,</HI> having lo&s;t her ma&s;ts, and being &s;o fearfully torn, as to be unfit for more &s;ervice, with his flag di&s;played in his boat, he &s;hifted aboard off the <HI>St. George;</HI> and finding her like|wi&s;e di&s;abled, as he was leaving of her to get into the <HI>Royall Charles,</HI> a cruel &s;hot funk his boat, and left him helple&s;s in the Ocean, who&s;e power being grea|ter then that of <HI>Van Trump;</HI> by his death chill'd that heat of courage, which <HI>Trump</HI> could ne|ver have cooled above water:
<PB N="93" REF="48">His death was by all, even the Dutch them&s;elves bewailed, who acknowledged him to have been a brave man, and valiant Souldi|er: His Ship couragiou&s;ly defen|ded by the &s;tout Earl of <HI>O&s;&s;ory</HI> (notwith&s;tanding all the at|tempts that <HI>Van Trump</HI> made to be Ma&s;ter of her.) was &s;afely towed off by the <HI>Hamp&s;hire</HI> Fre|gat.

<PB N="94" REF="49">Engli&s;h Fleet; but at length the Prince coming in time, broke in among&s;t the Dutch with unan|&s;werable force, and Captain <HI>Legg</HI> with his fire&s;hips, put them in great di&s;order and confu&s;ion; It was believed by all, that if the <HI>French</HI> had made their be&s;t u&s;e of that winde, <HI>de Ruyter</HI> and his Fleet could not &s;o fairly (as they did) by the favour of the night, have taken their leave of this and all other publick action with the Engli&s;h, during this War. The lo&s;&s;es in this la&s;t Fight were great on both &s;ides; many brave Com|manders, and Va&s;t number of men killed and wounded; but both &s;o po&s;itively pretending to victory, it is hard to determine who had the better; yet the Dutch by Sir <HI>Edward Spraggs</HI> death think|ing their title good, made the whole Countrey &s;o merry with the ringing noi&s;e of Victory: that the States changed the following

<P>The &s;ingular prudence and con|duct of Admiral <HI>de Ruyter</HI> in the &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages of this War, ren|dred him &s;o u&s;eful to his Countrey (of who&s;e tottering and decay|ing &s;tate he &s;eemed the <HI>Atlas</HI> and guardian) and &s;o con&s;iderable to his enemies, who by experience found it not ea&s;y to triumph-over him; that notwith&s;tanding the powerful efforts made for that end, the &s;ucce&s;s of affairs remai|ned &s;o little inclined to either &s;ide, that the one had no rea&s;on to de&s;pair, nor the other to &s;corn the pro&s;&s;ers of accommodation; made way for a Treaty of peace with <HI>England;</HI> and the States of <HI>Holland</HI> catching their opportuni|ty, when the vigorous interce&s;&s;i|on of the Crown, and Mini&s;ters of <HI>Spain</HI> concurred &s;o pat with the publick good offices of their

<P><HI>De Ruyter</HI> after much lo&s;s find|ing the attempt fruitle&s;s, left four &s;hips to crui&s;e thereabouts, and wait the coming of &s;ome Victu|allers expected from <HI>Holland,</HI> and next day &s;ailed to <HI>Dominico,</HI> there to take in fre&s;h water, which be|ing done, pa&s;&s;ing by <HI>Mevis</HI> and the <HI>Barmoodoes,</HI> and having mu|tually received and rendered ci|vilities with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> there, made &s;ail for <HI>Holland,</HI> and about

<P>Now the difficulty of the re|ducing <HI>Me&s;&s;ina,</HI> &s;o &s;trongly pro|tected by the <HI>French,</HI> requiring much of the care and Forces of <HI>Spain</HI> to be employed in <HI>Sicily,</HI> &s;en&s;ibly weakened the Confede|rates of the States of <HI>Holland</HI> in <HI>Flanders,</HI> where the danger lay at their doors.
