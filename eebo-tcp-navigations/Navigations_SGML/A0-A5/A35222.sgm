<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>HAving already given an account of His Maje&s;ty of Great <HI>Britains</HI> three famous Kingdoms of <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ire|land,</HI> we &s;hall now &s;hip our &s;elves for a <HI>New World,</HI> and therein di&s;cover the Acqui&s;itions and Dominions of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Monarchy in <HI>Amercia.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>New World</HI> is the mo&s;t proper name for this im|men&s;e Countrey, and new, as being di&s;covered by <HI>Chri&s;topher Columbus,</HI> not two hundred years ago, in 1492. The Ancient Fathers, Philo&s;ophers, and Poets, were of opinion, that tho&s;e places near the North and South Pole were inhabitable, by the extre|mity of cold, and the middle parts, becau&s;e of unrea|&s;onable heat, and thought it a great &s;oleci&s;m or con|tradiction, to believe the Earth was round, for hold|ing which opinion Pope <HI>Zachaus</HI> was &s;o zealous again&s;t Bi&s;hop <HI>Virgil,</HI> that he &s;entenced him, <HI>To be ca&s;t out of
<PB N="2" REF="4">
the Temple, and Church of God, and to be deprived of his Bi&s;hop|rick for this perver&s;e Doctrine, that there were Antipodes, or people who&s;e feet are placed again&s;t ours,</HI> though this di&s;co|very of <HI>America</HI> has fully confirmed the&s;e opinions, and evinced that there is no &s;uch torrid Zone, where the heat is &s;o noxious, as to unpeople any part of the Earth, and the yearly compa&s;&s;ing of the World, eviden|ceth the nece&s;&s;ity of Inhabitants, living on all parts of this earthly Globe; The next inquiry may be, whe|ther the Ancient had any knowledge of the&s;e Regions, which many incline to think they had not; for though <HI>Seneca</HI> &s;ays in his <HI>Msdea, That new Worlds &s;hall be di&s;cover|ed in the la&s;t Ages of the World, and</HI> Thule <HI>in</HI> Norway, <HI>&s;hall be no longer the utmo&s;t Nation of the World,</HI> yet this &s;eems only to intimate the common effects and di&s;|coveries of Navigation; And <HI>Plato's Atlantis,</HI> cannot intend this Countrey, becau&s;e he placeth it at the mouth of the Streights or <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea, which is &s;eparat|ed from <HI>America</HI> by a va&s;t Ocean, and &s;aies it is not now in being, but was by an earthquake &s;unk and over|whelmed in the Sea: Other Authors &s;ince that time have mentioned &s;ome I&s;lands in that Great Sea, but they &s;eem rather to be &s;ome of tho&s;e on the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Africa,</HI> than <HI>America,</HI> it being improbable, if not im|po&s;&s;ible, any &s;hould undertake &s;uch long and dangerous Voyages, before the compa&s;s was found out, when they were only directed by the motion of the Sun and Stars.</P>
<P>Yet is it not incredible but that in former Ages, &s;ome Ships might by Tempe&s;t or other Ca&s;ualties be driven to the&s;e parts, whereby &s;ome parts of <HI>America</HI> were peopled, but it is likely none ever returned back again to bring any news of their voyage. The mo&s;t proba|ble Relation of this kind is that of <HI>Madoc ap Owen Gwyneth,</HI> who upon the Civil di&s;&s;entions in his own Countrey of <HI>Wales,</HI> adventured to Sea, and leaving <HI>Ireland</HI> on the North, came to a Land unknown, where he &s;aw many very wonderful things, which by Dr. <HI>Dowel</HI> and Mr. <HI>Humfrey Lloyd</HI> is judged to be the main Land of <HI>America,</HI> being confirmed therein, as well by the
<PB N="3" REF="4">
&s;aying of <HI>Montezuma</HI> Emperor of <HI>Mexico,</HI> who declared that his Progenitors were Strangers as well as the re&s;t of the <HI>Mexicans,</HI> as by the u&s;e of divers <HI>Welch</HI> words among&s;t them ob&s;erved by Travellers; the &s;tory adds, that <HI>Ma|doc</HI> left &s;everal of his People there, and coming home, returned back with ten &s;ail full of <HI>Welchmen,</HI> yet it is cer|tain there are now left very few foot&s;teps of this <HI>Brit|ti&s;h</HI> expedition, and no &s;igns thereof were found at the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Arrival; they indeed u&s;ed a Cro&s;s at <HI>Cumana,</HI> and wor&s;hipped it at <HI>Acuzamil,</HI> but without the lea&s;t memory or knowledge of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the <HI>Welch</HI> words are very few, which might happen by chance to any other Language. Mr. <HI>Bretewood,</HI> and other learn|ed writers are of Opinion, that <HI>America</HI> received her fir&s;t Inhabitants from tho&s;e parts of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> where the <HI>Tartars</HI> fir&s;t inhabited the Coa&s;ts of both Countreys, being in that place not far a&s;under, and the likene&s;s of the People favouring the &s;ame, though the <HI>Indians</HI> in general are &s;o very ignorant as to a&s;cribe their begin|ning, &s;ome to a Fountain, and others to a Lake or Cave; But leaving the&s;e uncertainties, let us give a brief ac|count of the real di&s;covery thereof by <HI>Columbus,</HI> which is thus related by <HI>Gomara</HI> and <HI>Mariana,</HI> two Spani&s;h writers.</P>
<P>A certain Caravel &s;ailing in the Ocean, was carried by a &s;trong Ea&s;t wind of long continuance to an un|known Land never mentioned in the Maps or Charts of that Age; this Ship was much longer in returning than going, &s;o that all the company peri&s;ht by famine or other extremities, except the Pilot, and three or four Mariners, who all likewi&s;e died &s;oon after their arrival, leaving to <HI>Columbus</HI> their Landlord their Papers, with &s;ome account of their Di&s;coveries; the time, place, Countrey, and name of this Pilot is uncertain, and therefore other Authors affirm it to be a fable or <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> contrivance, as envying that an <HI>Italian</HI> and Forreigner &s;hould have the glory of being the fir&s;t di&s;coverer of the Indies, and the more judicious <HI>Spaniards</HI> account it a Tale, and give a more probable Relation thereof, and of the cau&s;e which moved <HI>Columbus</HI> to this mighty un|dertaking,
<PB N="4" REF="5">
and not the Pilots Papers or reports; For they write, that <HI>Chri&s;topher Colon</HI> or <HI>Columbus,</HI> was born at <HI>Nervi</HI> in the Territories of <HI>Genoa,</HI> and bred a Mari|ner from his Child-hood, trading into <HI>Syria</HI> and other Ea&s;tern Countries, after which he learnt the art of making Sea Cards, and went to <HI>Portugal</HI> to acquaint him&s;elf with the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Africa,</HI> and there married; In &s;ayling about the&s;e Seas, he ob&s;erved, that at certain &s;ea&s;ons of the year, the winds blew from the We&s;t, for a great while together, and judging they came from &s;ome Coa&s;ts beyond the Sea, he was &s;o concerned, that he re&s;olved to make a Trial thereof; He was now for|ty years old, and propounding to the State of <HI>Genoa,</HI> that if they would furni&s;h him with Ships, he would find a way by the We&s;t to the I&s;lands of Spices, they re|jected it as a dream or idle fancy; Being thus fru&s;trate of his hopes, he goes to <HI>Portugal,</HI> and communicates his de&s;ign to King <HI>Alphon&s;us,</HI> but with the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s; upon which he &s;ent his Brother <HI>Bartholomew Columbus,</HI> to King <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh of <HI>England,</HI> to &s;ollicit his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, while him&s;elf went into <HI>Spain,</HI> to impiore aid of the <HI>Ca&s;tilians.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bartholomew</HI> was unhappily taken by Pirates in his voyage to <HI>England,</HI> who robbing him and his company of all they had, he at length arrived, and was forced to get a mean livelyhood by making Sea Cards, and in a &s;hort time pre&s;ents a Map of the World to King <HI>Henry,</HI> with his Brothers offer of di&s;covery, which the King gladly accepted, and &s;ent for him into <HI>England;</HI> But he had &s;ped in his &s;uit before in <HI>Spain,</HI> for coming thi|ther, and conferring with two able <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Pilots they advi&s;ed him to apply him&s;elf to the Dukes of <HI>Medina Sidonia,</HI> and <HI>Medina Caeli,</HI> who giving him recommen|dation to the Queens Confe&s;&s;or, he arrived at the Court of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> in 1486. but <HI>Ferdinando</HI> and <HI>I&s;abella</HI> then King and Queen of <HI>Spain,</HI> being ingaged hotly in the Wars of <HI>Granada</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Moors,</HI> he at fir&s;t found but cold entertainment. Thus he continued for &s;ome time in a mean and contemptible Condition, till at
<PB N="5" REF="5">
length the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Toledo</HI> procured him audi|ence, where he was favourably received, and promi&s;|ed di&s;patch upon concluding the Wars in <HI>Granada,</HI> and accordingly he was furni&s;hed with three Caravels at the Kings charges, and &s;ixteen thou&s;and Duckets in money.</P>
<P>In 1492. <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 3. <HI>Columbus</HI> accompanied with about one hundred and Twenty Per&s;ons, &s;et &s;ail for <HI>Gomera,</HI> one of the <HI>Canary</HI> I&s;lands, where having refre&s;ht, after many days, they encountred the Sea called <HI>Sarga&s;&s;o,</HI> from an Herb like <HI>Sampire,</HI> wherewith it is &s;o covered, that it appears like a green Field, with empty berries, like a Goo&s;eberry, and is &s;o thick, that the Water cannot be &s;een, hindring the pa&s;&s;age of the Ship, without a &s;trong wind; the&s;e weeds are thought to reach to the bottom of the Sea, though there exceeding deep, and above four hundred miles di&s;tant from the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa;</HI> This &s;trange accident much &s;urprized the <HI>Spa|niards,</HI> and had occa&s;ioned their return, had not the &s;ight of &s;ome birds incouraged them with hopes of Land not far off; After thirty three days &s;ayling, de&s;pairing of &s;ucce&s;s, the company mutined, threatning to throw <HI>Columbus</HI> into the Sea, di&s;daining that a <HI>Genou&s;e</HI> &s;tranger &s;hould thus abu&s;e them, but at length by &s;oft words, and &s;trong promi&s;es he qualified their anger, <HI>Oct.</HI> 11. following, one <HI>Roderigo di Triana,</HI> cried out, <HI>Land, Land;</HI> the be&s;t mu&s;ick that <HI>Columbus</HI> could de|&s;ire, who to pacify the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> had ingaged, that if no Land appeared in three days he would then return; one of the company the night before had de&s;cried Fire, which rai&s;ed his expectation of having &s;ome great re|ward from the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> of which being fru&s;trate at his return, he in a rage renounced his Chri&s;tianity and turned Moor.</P>
<P>With Tears of Joy, the late mutinous Mariners be|hold the de&s;ired Land, and they that Ye&s;terday were ready to de&s;troy, now as far di&s;tracted with contrary pa&s;&s;ions, imbrace and almo&s;t adore their dear <HI>Columbus,</HI> for &s;o happily bringing them to this Land of Promi&s;e;

On &s;hore they go, and felling a Tree, make a Cro&s;s thereof, which they there erected, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this New World, in the name of the Catholick King; They fir&s;t landed in an I&s;land called <HI>Guanah<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ni,</HI> one of the <HI>Lucai,</HI> which <HI>Columbus</HI> named St. <HI>Salvadore,</HI> from whence he &s;ayled to <HI>Baracoa,</HI> an Haven on the North &s;ide of the I&s;le of <HI>Cuba,</HI> and landing, inquired of the Inhabitants for <HI>Cipango,</HI> or <HI>Japan,</HI> which they under|&s;tanding to be <HI>Cibao</HI> in <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> where are the riche&s;t Mines, they made &s;igns to them that they were in <HI>Haiti,</HI> which name they gave to <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> and &s;ome of them went with him thither; but no earthly joy is without &s;ome di&s;a&s;ter, for here their Admiral &s;plit upon a Rock, but the men were &s;aved by the help of other Ships; This happened on the North part of <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> where they &s;aw &s;ome Inhabitants, who for fear of &s;trangers, in&s;tantly fled into the Mountains: One wo|man they got, whom they u&s;ed kindly, giving her meat, drink and clothes, and &s;o di&s;mi&s;&s;ing her, who declaring their civility to the re&s;t, they &s;oon came in Troops to the Ships, judging the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to be &s;ome Divine Na|tion &s;ent from Heaven; Though before they thought them Canibals or Man-eaters, and &s;uch indeed they afterward proved in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, not leaving in &s;ome few years after their arrival above two hundred <HI>Indians,</HI> alive, of four Millions that before inhabited the&s;e Coun|tries.</P>
<P>Before the di&s;covery of this I&s;land by <HI>Columbus,</HI> the People were informed thereof by an Oracle, for one of their Kings being very importunate with their <HI>Zemes,</HI> or Gods, to know future events, fa&s;ted five days toge|ther, &s;pending his time in continual mourning; After which the <HI>Zemes</HI> declared; <HI>That &s;ome years after there would arrive a &s;trange Nation, clothed, bearded, and armed with &s;hining Swords, which would out a man a&s;under in the middle, who &s;hould de&s;troy the ancient Images of their Gods, aboli&s;h their Ceremonies, and &s;lay their Children.</HI> In remembrance of which Oracle they compo&s;ed a &s;olemn Elegy, which upon Holy days they u&s;ed mournfully to &s;ing. Nothing
<PB N="7" REF="6">
more plea&s;ed the <HI>Spaniards</HI> than the Gold, which the In|nocent Inhabitants exchanged with them for Bells, Gla&s;&s;es, Points, and other Trifles. <HI>Columbus</HI> got leave of the King of <HI>Hi&s;paniola</HI> to build a Fort, and leaving 38 <HI>Spaniards</HI> therein, taking with him &s;ix <HI>Indians,</HI> he re|turned to <HI>Spain,</HI> and was highly care&s;&s;ed by the King and Q. and being honoured with the Title of Admiral, and inriched with the Tenths of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> gains in the <HI>In|dies,</HI> he is &s;ent a &s;econd time (with his Brother <HI>Bartho|lomew,</HI> who was made Vice-Roy of <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI>) with &s;eventeen &s;ail of Ships, and fifteen hundred men; when he arrived, he found all his men were murdered by the <HI>Indians,</HI> who laid the blame on their in&s;olent carriage toward them.</P>
<P><HI>Columbus</HI> now built the Town of <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> and after|ward Saint <HI>Domingo,</HI> and Fort St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> but in both places the <HI>Spaniards</HI> died of Famine; for the <HI>Indians</HI> being unwilling to have &s;uch Neighbours, refu&s;ed to plant their Maiz and Jucca, and &s;o &s;tarved both them|&s;elves and their new Gue&s;ts. At this place the <HI>Spaniards</HI> got that terrible di&s;ea&s;e called &s;ince the <HI>French</HI> Pox, of the <HI>Indian</HI> women, and in requital brought among them a more mortal and infectious di&s;temper, that is, the Small-Pox, which de&s;troyed Thou&s;ands, and was utterly unknown before in that Countrey. After this <HI>Columbus</HI> di&s;covered <HI>Cuba, Jamaica,</HI> and other adjacent I&s;les, and likewi&s;e part of the main Land of <HI>America;</HI> He repaired his Fleet at <HI>Jamaica,</HI> where &s;ome of his men were &s;ick, and others mutinous, which the <HI>Indians</HI> ob&s;erving, re|fu&s;ed to bring him in provi&s;ions, whereupon being &s;traitned, he thought of this Stratagem, &s;ending for &s;ome of the I&s;landers, he a&s;&s;ured them, that if they did not furni&s;h him with nece&s;&s;aries, the Divine wrath would con&s;ume them, a token whereof would be, that within two days, the face of the Moon &s;hould be dark|ned, at which time he knew there would be an Ecclip&s;e of the Moon, which the&s;e &s;imple People find|ing

He had there a &s;ight of the Savage In|habitants, who rowed to his Ship in Boats of Seals Skins, they eat or rather devour raw Fle&s;h and Fi&s;h, their hair was long and black, broad faces, flat no&s;es, colour tawny or Olive, which neither Sun nor Wind, but nature it &s;elf imprinted on them, as appeared by their Infants, and &s;eems to be the complexion of all the <HI>Americans;</HI> their clothing was Seals Skins, the wo|men were painted on the Cheeks, and about the Eyes with blew &s;treaks. The&s;e Savages intercepted 5 <HI>Engli&s;h|men</HI> and their Boat, they took al&s;o one of them, whom

<P>Whereupon the next year a &s;econd voyage was made to bring home more of this Ore, and coming into the&s;e <HI>Streights</HI> in <HI>July</HI> 1577. they found them in a manner &s;hut up with a long wall of Ice, which very much in|dangered their Ships. They found a Fi&s;h as big as a Porpice dead upon the Shoar twelve foot long, hav|ing a Horn of two yards growing out of the Snout, wreathed and &s;treight like a wax tapor, &amp; was thought to be a Sea Unicorn; It was broken on the top, where|in the Sailers affirmed they put Spiders which pre|&s;ently died. It was pre&s;ented to the Queen at their return, and &s;ent to <HI>Win&s;or</HI> to be re&s;erved in the Wardrope for a curio&s;ity. They went on Shoar, and had &s;ome skirmi&s;hes with the Inhabitants, who were &s;o fierce and re&s;olute, that finding them&s;elves wound|ed, they leapt off the Rocks into the Sea rather than fall into the hands of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> the re&s;t fled, only one Woman and her Child they brought away, and another man, who &s;eeing the Picture of his Countrey|man in the Ship that was taken the year before, thought him to be alive, and was very angry that he would not &s;peak to him, wondring how our People could make men live or die at their plea&s;ure. It was very plea&s;ant to ob&s;erve the behaviour of the man and woman when they were brought together; who though put into the &s;ame Cabbin, &s;hewed &s;uch &s;igns of Cha&s;tity, and Mode&s;ty, as might ju&s;tly &s;hame Chri&s;ti|ans who come &s;o far &s;hort of them; when the&s;e Sava|ges would trade, their manner was to lay down &s;ome|what of theirs and go their ways, expecting the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> &s;hould lay down &s;omething in exchange; if they like the value when they come again, they take it, otherwi&s;e they take away only their own; they made

&s;igns that their <HI>Catchoe</HI> or King was higher of &s;tature than any of ours, and carried upon mens Shoulders. They could not hear what became of their five men ta|ken the year before, only they found &s;ome of their Ap|parel, which made them judge the Savages had eaten them; Having laden their Ship with Oar, they returned.</P>
<P>The next year 1578. with fifteen &s;ail another Voyage was made by Captain <HI>Frobi&s;her</HI> for further di&s;covery. He went on &s;hoar <HI>June</HI> 20 on <HI>Frizeland,</HI> which is in length about 25 Leagues, in 57 degrees of Latitude, which he named We&s;t <HI>England,</HI> where they e&s;pied certain Tents and People like the former, who upon their approach fled; in the Tents they found a Box of &s;mall Nails, red Herrings, and boards of Fir-tree, with other things wrought very Artificially, &s;o that they were either ingenious workmen them&s;elves, or traded with others; &s;ome think this to be <HI>Frie&s;land,</HI> and joined to <HI>Greenland.</HI> In going from hence one Ship called the <HI>Salamander</HI> &s;ailing with a &s;trong gale, &s;truck with &s;uch violence upon the back of a Whale with her full &s;tem that &s;he &s;tood &s;till without motion, whereat the Whale made a hideous roaring, and lifting up his body and tail above water, &s;unk in&s;tantly to the bottom; Two days after they found a dead Whale, which was &s;uppo&s;ed the &s;ame. <HI>July</HI> 2. they entred the Strieghts, the mouth where|of was barr'd with Mountains of Ice, wherewith a Bark was &s;unk, with part of a hou&s;e they de&s;igned to erect there, the men were all &s;aved, and the other Ships in much danger by the &s;everity of the Ice, Fogs, and Snow. The&s;e I&s;lands of Ice &s;eem to be congealed in the winter further North in &s;ome Bays or Rivers, the waters thereof being fre&s;h, and the Sun melting the tops of the Ice rills of fre&s;h water run down, which meeting together make an indifferent Stream; the&s;e Rocks being by the &s;ummers Sun loo&s;ed and broken from their natural Scituation, are carried whither the &s;wift Current and the outragions Winds drive them.</P>
<P>Some of the&s;e Icy Rocks or I&s;lands are half a mile about, and four&s;core fathoms above water, be&s;ides the

The People repre&s;ent the <HI>Tartars</HI> in apparel and living. It is colder here in 62, than in ten degrees farther North, which happens from the cold North Ea&s;t Winds, which brings this &s;harp Air off the Ice; The Na|tives are excellent Archers, they wear the Skins of Deer, Bears, Foxes, Hares, and of Fowls &s;owed toge|ther; in the Summer the hary &s;ide outward, in the Winter inward, yet many go naked; they &s;hoot Fi&s;h with their Darts, and kindle Fire by rubbing two &s;ticks together; The Bea&s;ts, Fowls and Fi&s;hes they kill, are their Hou&s;es, Bedding, Meat, Drink, Ho&s;e, Shoes Apparel, Sails Boats, and indeed all their riches; they eat all things raw, yea Gra&s;s and Shrubs, and &s;uck Ice to &s;atisfy their thir&s;t; there is no fle&s;h or fi&s;h which they find dead, though never &s;o filthy, but they will take it up and eat it, yet &s;omtimes they parboil their meats in little kettles made of Bea&s;ts Skins, the bloud and water they drink, and lick the bloody Knife with their Tongues, and u&s;e the &s;ame remedy for cu|ring their wounds, that is, licking them only with their Tongues.</P>
<P>They have great plenty of Fowl, our men killing 15 hundred in one day; they have thicker Skins, and more Feathers than ours, which requires them to be flea'd before eaten; They have no hurtful creeping things but Spiders, and a Gnat, which is very trouble&s;om, nor any Timber but what the undermining water brings from other places; They are great Magicians, and when their heads ake, they tie a great Stone with a &s;tring into a &s;tick, and u&s;ing certain Charms, the

Stone cannot be moved with all the force of a man, yet at other times &s;eems as light as a Feather; they lie gro|velling with their Faces on the Ground, making a noi&s;e as if they Wor&s;hiped the Devil under the Earth; they u&s;e great black Dogs like Wolves to draw their Sleds, and &s;ome of a le&s;&s;er kind they feed upon. In the mid&s;t of Summer, they have Hail and Snow, &s;ome|times a Foot thick, which Freezeth as it Falls, and the Ground is Frozen 3 Fathom deep, at which time the Sun is not ab&s;ent above 3 hours and an half, during which it was &s;o very light, that we could &s;ee to read. There are no Rivers or Running Springs, but what the Sun cau&s;es to come from the Snow. They Row in their Leather Boats fa&s;ter with one Oar, than we can ours with all our Oars. They &s;eem to have commerce with other Nations, from whom they have a &s;mall quantity of Iron.</P>
<P N="3">III. In 1585. Mr. <HI>John Davis</HI> made his fir&s;t Voy|age for the Northwe&s;t Di&s;covery, and in 54 Degrees, they went on Shore on an I&s;land where they &s;aw divers Savages, who &s;eem'd to Wor&s;hip the Sun, pointing up to it with their Hands, and therewith &s;triking their Brea&s;ts, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> an&s;wering them with the &s;ame Acti|ons, they took it for a confirmed League and Agree|ment between them, they then leaped and danced with a kind of Timbrel, which they &s;truck with a &s;tick, their Garments were the Skins of Birds and Bea&s;ts, they killed white Bears, one of who&s;e Forefeet was fourteen Inches broad, and the Fle&s;h &s;o fat, they were forc't to throw it away; by their dung they &s;eem'd to feed on Gra&s;s, which was like Hor&s;e-dung, they heard tame Dogs howl on the Shore, for killing one he had a Col|lar about his Neck, he had a Bone in his Pizel, and &s;eem'd inured to the Sled, two of which they found.</P>
<P>Next year Captain <HI>Davis</HI> made a &s;econd Voyage, and found the <HI>Savage</HI> People very tractable; they are great Idolaters and Witches, having many Images which they carried about them, and in their Boats; they found a Grave wherein many were buried, and cover|ed

In 66 Degrees they found it very hot, and were much troubled with Musket to Flies; all the Coa&s;ts hereabout &s;eemed bro|ken I&s;lands; then returning Southward, they Coa&s;ted <HI>Greenland,</HI> but were hindred from Harbour by the Ice, their Hou&s;es near the Sea&s;ide were made with pieces of Wood cro&s;&s;ed over with Poles, and covered with Earth; our Men plaid at Football with the I&s;landers upon the Ice. Captain <HI>Davis</HI> his third Voyage was per|formed the next year 1587. wherein he di&s;covered to 73 Degrees, finding the Sea all open, and forty Lea|gues between the Shore on each &s;ide, having <HI>Greenland</HI> on the Ea&s;t, and <HI>America</HI> on the We&s;t, near which was another I&s;land, which for its dreadful a&s;pect, being co|vered with Snow, without Wood, Earth, or Gra&s;s to be &s;een; and the terrible noi&s;e of the Ice, he named the <HI>I&s;le of De&s;olation,</HI> but the untimely death of Sir <HI>Fran|cis Wal&s;ingham,</HI> hindred the further Pro&s;ecution of the&s;e Di&s;coveries.</P>

<P>This <HI>Province</HI> of <HI>Carolina</HI> was in the Year 1663.

And the &s;aid Lords Proprietors have there &s;etled a Con&s;titution of Go|vernment, whereby is granted Liberty of Con&s;cience, and wherein all po&s;&s;ible care is taken for the e|qual Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice, and for the la&s;ting Security of the Inhabitants both in their Per&s;ons and E&s;tates.</P>
<P>By the care and endeavours of the &s;aid Lords Pro|prietors, and at their very great charge, two Colonies have been &s;etled in this <HI>Province,</HI> the one at <HI>Albemarle</HI> in the mo&s;t Northerly part, the other at <HI>A&s;hly</HI> River, which is in the Latitude of thirty two Degrees od Mi|nutes.</P>

<P><HI>A&s;hly-River</HI> was fir&s;t &s;etled in <HI>April</HI> 1670. the Lords Proprietors having at their &s;ole charge, &s;et out three Ve&s;&s;els, with a con&s;iderable number of able Men, eighteen Moneths Victuals, with Clothes, Tools, Am|munition, and what el&s;e was thought nece&s;&s;ary for a new Settlement, and continued at this charge to &s;up|ply the Colony for divers years after, until the Inha|bitants were able by their own Indu&s;try to live of them&s;elves; in which condition they have been for divers years pa&s;t, and are arrived to a very great De|gree of Plenty of all &s;orts of Provi&s;ions. In&s;omuch, that mo&s;t &s;orts are already cheaper there, than in any other of the Engli&s;h Colonys, and they are plentifully enough &s;upplied with all things from <HI>England</HI> or other Parts. <HI>A&s;hly-River,</HI> about &s;even Miles in from the Sea, divides it &s;elf into two Branches; the Southermo&s;t retaining the name of <HI>A&s;hly-River,</HI> the North Branch is called <HI>Cooper-River.</HI> In <HI>May,</HI> 1680. the Lords Pro|prietors &s;ent their Orders to the Government their, ap|pointing the Port-Town for the&s;e two Rivers to be Built on the Point of Land that divides them, and to be called <HI>Charles</HI> Town, &s;ince which time about an hundred Hou&s;es are there Built, and more are Build|ing daily by the Per&s;ons of all &s;orts that come there to Inhabit, from the more Northern Engli&s;h Colonys, and the Sugar I&s;lands, <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland;</HI> and many Per&s;ons who went to <HI>Carolina</HI> Servants, being Indu&s;|trious, &s;ince they came out of their times with their Ma&s;ters, at who&s;e charge they were Tran&s;ported, have gotten good Stocks of Cattle, and Servants of their own; have here al&s;o Built Hou&s;es, and exerci&s;e their Trades: And many that went thither in that condition, are now worth &s;everal Hundreds of Pounds, and live in a very plentiful condition, and their E&s;ta|tes &s;till encrea&s;ing.

Before the di&s;covery of <HI>America,</HI> there were not to be found in the&s;e parts any Hor&s;es, Kine, Oxen, Sheep, Goats, Swine, or Dogs, but for the bet|ter conveniency of their Navigations and &s;upply of their Ships in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity they left &s;ome of the&s;e Creatures in &s;everal parts of this <HI>New-found World,</HI> where they have &s;ince multiplyed &s;o exceedingly, that now they are more common, as well on the Continent as the <HI>Caribees,</HI> than in any part of <HI>Eu|rope</HI></P>

wherein it carries its young, which it lays upon the ground at plea&s;ure by opening that natural pur&s;e, when he would leave that place he opens it again, and the young ones get in, and &s;o he carries them with him wherever he goes.

<P>There are al&s;o in &s;ome of the&s;e I&s;lands a kind of Wild Swine, with Short Ears, almo&s;t no Tails, and their Navels on their backs, &s;ome of them are all black, others have certain white Spots, their &s;trange grunting is more hideous than that of Swine, they are called <HI>Ja|varis;</HI> The fle&s;h is of ta&s;t good enough, but very hardly taken, in regard the Bore having a kind of vent or hole on the back, by which he refre&s;hes his Lungs, is in a manner unwearied, and if he be forced to &s;top, and be per&s;ued by the Dogs, he is armed with &s;uch Sharp and cutting Tu&s;hes, that he tears to pieces all who &s;et upon him. The <HI>Tatous</HI> is another &s;trange creature, armed with a hard &s;caly coat wherewith they cover and &s;ecure them&s;elves as with Armour: They have a head and &s;nout like a Pig, wherewith they turn up the ground, they have al&s;o in every Paw five very &s;harp Claws, which they u&s;e more readily to thru&s;t away the Earth and di&s;cover the Roots, wherewith they are fat|tened in the night time.

It is very Mountainous in the mid&s;t which incompa&s;&s;es an inacce&s;&s;ible bottom, where from the tops of certain Rocks may be &s;een an infinite number of Vipers, Dra|gons and other dreadful venemous Creatures, whom none dares approach unto. Yet there are many fruit|ful valleys producing &s;everal commodities, but e&s;peci|ably Tobacco which is planted by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> but the Natives who are <HI>Cannibals</HI> and very barbarous do much hinder the coming of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to &s;ettle there: For the <HI>Caribeans</HI> are very numerous in it, and have a long time entertained tho&s;e who came to vi&s;it them with a &s;tory of a va&s;t and mon&s;trous Serpent which had its aboad in that bottom, affirming that there was on the head of it a very &s;parkling &s;tone like a Carbun|cle of ine&s;timable price, and that it commonly covered this Rich Jewel with a thin moving Skin like that of a mans Eye-lid, but that when it went to drink or &s;port|ed
