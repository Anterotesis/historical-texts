<P>DIvers PROTE|STANTS ha|ving &s;ought after Victory through Flight, their Retreat cannot fail of &s;uch Adventures as are
<PB REF="3">&s;urprizing, and that have very much of the Roman|tick Air. Tho&s;e poor peo|ple have been a&s;&s;aulted in &s;o many manners, that they are become ingenious in Intreagues, and in find|ing out unknown Ways, to deceive the &s;ubtlety and vigilance of their Per&s;ecu|tors, which might have forc'd them to &s;erve that which is not God, in its own Nature. This <HI>Re|viv'd Fugitive</HI>'s a|ver&s;ion
<PB REF="3">to a &s;trange Wor|&s;hip was very great, tho&s;e attempts which &s;he has made to prevent her ha|ving any &s;hare in it, have been as great. She has overcome her &s;elf to ma&s;ter tho&s;e Ob&s;tacles, which were oppos'd to her Liberty, and that Providence which u&s;u|ally gives its ble&s;&s;ing to tho&s;e Cares which we take not to be &s;eparated from the true Religion, has govern'd all the &s;teps which &s;he
<PB REF="4">has made to avoid &s;o &s;ad a &s;eparation, and has &s;natch'd her more than once out of the jaws of Death, that &s;he might at la&s;t &s;ecure a Good, which by the Go&s;pel is termed the Good Part, and the &s;ole nece&s;&s;ary thing. I addre&s;s to you, <HI>Madam,</HI> the Relation of it; with all the re&s;pect due to your Merits and Elevation. Di|vers Rea&s;ons ought to make me fear that I may
<PB REF="4">be blam'd for taking the liberty to offer you &s;o &s;mall a thing, and I ought to have fear'd to expo&s;e my &s;elf in &s;o great a Light. But I take Heart, <HI>Ma|dam,</HI> and I de&s;pair not, but that you will look on this &s;mall Piece with a favourable Eye, and that you will have &s;o much boun|ty as to de&s;cend to this <HI>Reviv'd Fugitive,</HI> all neglected as &s;he is. I have cau&s;e to believe &s;o,
<PB REF="5">when I repre&s;ent to my &s;elf how great the Love is, and how &s;trong the application, which you have for our Religion; what will not be your joy to &s;ee her Triumph in her Per&s;on over tho&s;e terrible Temptations, which Love, and Intere&s;t, and the Examples and So|licitations of a Brother have a&s;&s;ail'd her with: That in her Adventures there has been &s;uch extra|ordinary Circum&s;tances,
<PB REF="5">that are not wholly un|worthy of your Highne&s;&s;es Curio&s;ity, and that being of a Province, which the Heavens has honour'd with &s;o Illu&s;trious a Birth, as that of your Highne&s;s; &s;he does hope that you will not di&s;approve her Ambition, to treat you with a Di&s;h of your own Countrey fare; &s;he even flatters her &s;elf with the thoughts that you will concern your &s;elf in your Country Womans evil

<HEAD>THE Reviv'd Fugitive: A NOVEL.</HEAD>
<P>LOve never did kindle &s;o bright a flame, as that which <HI>Madmoi&s;elle</HI> of <HI>Charlieu</HI> did pre&s;erve in her heart for the Knight St. <HI>Hu|bert,</HI> notwith&s;tanding all the Rea&s;ons which &s;he thought to have to drive it from thence, &s;trengthned with that great re|&s;ervedne&s;s which &s;he has always profe&s;s'd. And peradventure, that there was never &s;een &s;uch a ten|derne&s;s
<PB N="2" REF="8">as that of the Knight St. <HI>Hubert,</HI> for the Charming <HI>Madmoi&s;elle</HI> of <HI>Charlieu.</HI> They were both of one Province, but the Knight's inclinations having led him to make his fir&s;t Cam|paigns in a very young Age, he had not had time to ob&s;erve the Beauty of a Per&s;on who was then but in her Spring, and in a ten|der Delineation. Wherefore, it was not till &s;he was at <HI>Paris,</HI> at the Opera of <HI>Phaeton,</HI> that he learnt that which he had remain'd ignorant of till then. He was come to Court to &s;olicite for a a vacant Employ at Court, and the Lady's Brother, to follow a Sute in the grand Chamber. That rencounter of Bu&s;ine&s;s was to &s;ignifie &s;omething to him, and did progno&s;ticate to his indiffe|rency &s;ome con&s;iderable Adven|tures, that made him to lend to the Ornaments of the Theatre
<PB N="3" REF="8">but an indifferent attention; and while agreeable Mu&s;ick did po&s;&s;e&s;s his Ear, he had no Eyes, but for a young Stranger, who was ea&s;ie to be di&s;tingui&s;h'd from the re&s;t, by her own Per&s;on.</P>
<P>He had &s;ome knowledge of all the Beauties that made a figure at <HI>Paris,</HI> and the Charmes of that new Object oblig'd him to re|proach him&s;elf of neglect, not without &s;evere reflections: He enquir'd of a Gentleman of his acquaintance, Whether that Face was new to him; and becau&s;e he could no be well inform'd by him, he flatter'd him&s;elf with the hopes to learn more of her at the going out of the Palace.</P>
<P>Fortune did favour him in that, for having had her always in view, it luckily happen'd, to gra|tify his Curio&s;ity, that a Prie&s;t who carried the Sacrament to a &s;ick Per&s;on, pa&s;&s;ing by at that
<PB N="4" REF="9">time, &s;he ha&s;tily turn'd back in the Alley, to get to her Coach before the great Gate, where &s;he order'd it &s;hould wait for her.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e marks of a true right Hugonor, or Prote&s;tant, were not capable to divert him from the &s;atisfaction he propos'd to inform him&s;elf throughly at <HI>Cha|ranton,</HI> which is the place where tho&s;e of the Reformed Religion have a Church allow'd them. He returned to his Inn, well &s;atisfied with &s;o happy a di&s;covery, and re&s;olv'd to go thither the very next Day to Church. But it was his ill fortune not to find there what he &s;ought after. The King had not yet caus'd the Edict to be Proclam'd, which forbids the Hu|gonots to &s;uffer any Roman Ca|tholicks in their A&s;&s;emblies; and that which might have rais'd &s;ome &s;cruple in the Knight, (who
<PB N="5" REF="9">was an ab&s;olute worthy Per&s;on) could not yet produce any in him. He remain'd in the Church very quiet during the whole Sermon, which that Day was deliver'd by an eminent Preacher; and he being not a Romani&s;t by meer &s;tubbornne&s;s and Caprichio, he found nothing in it that was either horrid or black.</P>
<P>This fir&s;t que&s;t having &s;uc|ceeded &s;o ill, he thought to have mi&s;taken him&s;elf in his judg|ment, and he began to attribute to hazard and meer chance that fear which his pretended Religio|nary had been put in the Day before. He return'd to <HI>Paris</HI> in a greater di&s;order than ever, and almo&s;t dead with de&s;ire of re|trieving &s;o delicate a Beauty. He run over all the choi&s;e&s;t parts of the City in hopes to find her; he often walk'd in the Tuilleries, and in that odd kind of unea&s;ine&s;s,
<PB N="6" REF="10">he would know, at what rate &s;o ever, the Name and Birth of &s;o rare an Object. One Day that the Weather was very fair, and that he was &s;eriou&s;ly thinking in the mo&s;t remote part of the Labi|rinth on the oddne&s;s of his Stars, he heard his own Name mentio|ned very near to him. <Q>I con|fe&s;s, <HI>&s;aid a Lady to a friend of hers,</HI> that Mon&s;ieur of St. <HI>Hubert</HI> is brave, that he has a great deal of &s;ence and di&s;cernment, with all that can be requir'd be|&s;ides to nicely carry on an In|treague; there is &s;omething in his Air which Charmes at fir&s;t &s;ight; and I no &s;ooner had &s;een him, but I di&s;tingui&s;hed him from the Croud; but my dear Child, he is a Man, and doubt|le&s;s that he is as apt as others to run into tho&s;e defects &s;o incident to Men of &s;ence; I mean Levity and Indi&s;cretion.</Q>
<PB N="7" REF="10">This Di&s;cour&s;e being expre&s;&s;ed after a very tender Manner, had render'd him extreamly attentive, and peradventure he might have drawn &s;ome light from thence, if the coming of two other La|dies into that Walk, where he &s;tood before un&s;een, had not di&s;turb'd the others Conver&s;ation who &s;ought out a more retir'd place, leaving that Po&s;t &s;o ad|vantageous to our Knight.</P>
<P>He, not to lo&s;e any time, did all he could to rejoyn them im|mediately, and having &s;lided along the Walks, he at la&s;t got to the appointed place, but all did di&s;|appear, and with much to do he gather'd up a <HI>Billet</HI> half cover'd over with Leaves; he knew not whether he had be&s;t to read it immediately, and his great de&s;ire to follow the Ladies had hindred him from it, if by chance he had not &s;een in it the word Love
<PB N="8" REF="11">writ in a large Character. This On&s;et is too fair not to peru&s;e the re&s;t, &s;aid he pre&s;ently to him|&s;elf; then having laid it quite open, he found in it what follows.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>BILLET.</HEAD>
<P><HI>LOve affords me le&s;s quiet than ever, Madam, and I heartily wi&s;h that in granting me the one, you were plea&s;ed to afford me the other al&s;o. I thought that Lovers were not made to &s;uffer Eternally, or at lea&s;t, that &s;omething was to be born of them, yet I find quite the contrary in adoring you; you are &s;till the &s;ame, as well as your Charms; and if after you have let me know I was not wholly indiffe|rent to you, you &s;till treat me as an Enemy, I &s;hall doubtle&s;s de|&s;troy my &s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>There needed not &s;o much to
<PB N="9" REF="11">render our Knight a Philo&s;opher, and to lead him into &s;erious. Re|flections; but he believ'd it a point of Prudence, and a con|cern to his quiet, fir&s;t to know tho&s;e Ladies who had nam'd him, and who probably had lo&s;t the <HI>Billet.</HI> He run to the mo&s;t fre|quented Avenue, and his &s;urprize was &s;omewhat great, to &s;ee de|part from thence that Per&s;on whom he &s;ought in all places, accompanied with another Lady; he pre&s;ently imagin'd that it was they who had nam'd him, and burning with a vehement de&s;ire to &s;peak to them, he was draw|ing near with that De&s;ign, when they put on their Masks, and got into a Neighbouring Walk. He therefore was contented with &s;imply ob&s;erving them; and being joyn'd by a Friend, he thought he might without any more ado go and re&s;t him&s;elf on
<PB N="10" REF="12">a Bench, with him, of which the Ladies had already made Choice. There were others al&s;o &s;itting there, and every body being very particular, his Curio&s;ity in&s;pired him to go and give a Servant Orders who waited for him at the Garden Gate, to be in readine&s;s to follow that Coach which he &s;hould &s;hew him, and to give him a faithful account of it.</P>
<P>He was &s;carce got out, when a little Foot-boy, having enquired of his Chair-men, whether that was Mon&s;ieur of St. <HI>Hubert,</HI> did ha&s;tily deliver him a Letter, of which it had been &s;aid, <HI>That He him&s;elf &s;hould bring back the An&s;wer.</HI> He pre&s;ently imagin'd it to be one of tho&s;e ob&s;cene <HI>Billets</HI> with which Debauch'd Women are wont to Regale Per&s;ons by little expre&s;s Me&s;&s;ages; and ha|ving ca&s;t it on the Ground, he was making an end to order his
<PB N="11" REF="12">Man what he had to do, when the unknown Lady came, got into her Coach, and &s;teer'd her Cour&s;e towards the <HI>Red-Bridge.</HI></P>
<P>The Knight having made a &s;ign to his Man, he ran as fa&s;t as he could after it, &s;o that the hopes to learn before Night, where dwelt that Beautiful Per&s;on; ha|ving given him time to reflect on what he had lately done, he &s;ought again after his <HI>Billet,</HI> vex'd that he had not read it; and by good fortune having found it again in the &s;ame place where he had thrown it, he pa&s;s'd his time in the peru&s;al of it, expecting his Spies return.</P>
<P>Judging by what it contain'd, that it was an An&s;wer to that which he had found in the La|byrinth, he was in &s;o great an amazement that he had much to do to get out of it. He was in|formed that the Lady lov'd pa&s;|&s;ionately
<PB N="12" REF="13">the Gentleman for whom it was de&s;ign'd, and at the &s;ame time fancying that it was his fair unknown Creature, who appa|rently was pierc'd with a violent Love for &s;ome other, he con|ceiv'd thereat an unexpre&s;&s;ible trouble; The Mi&s;take was too evident to draw any Con&s;equences from thence to his advantage; he did not know her, he had never &s;poken to her, far from having any Intreague with her, and the Errour was but too vi&s;ible to be mi&s;taken in it.</P>
<P>Mean time he was bemoaning his De&s;tiny, and in his Complaint he thought on his Adventure with &s;o much application, that three Officers came up to him which he did not perceive. You pon|der a little too much in Publick, our dear Kin&s;man, <HI>&s;aid one of the three to him,</HI> who was effectually of the &s;ame Family; and if you
<PB N="13" REF="13">were in humour to come to &mdash;to di&s;&s;ipate, at the favour of a little Debauch, that Me|lancholy which overcomes you, we &s;hould all be oblig'd to you for it. 'La&s;s! poor Man! <HI>&s;aid another,</HI> doubtle&s;s &s;ome Angel has appear'd to him in the Garden, which has ravi&s;h'd him into an Exta&s;ie; and, if I mi&s;take not, <HI>added the third,</HI> he has met there with <HI>Rue</HI> and <HI>Par&s;lee.</HI> Cou|rage Knight, <HI>&s;aid they all three to him at once,</HI> he is now in his Noviciate of Love, he is now a right Knight, a Knight in all the forms, and without Circum&s;pe|ction, farewel to all Plea&s;ures, and to all the <HI>Philles's.</HI> The&s;e Com|pliments did &s;omewhat amaze him, being partly got out of it, he di&s;guis'd as well as he could the troubles of his Mind. You are too gay by half, an|&s;wer'd he, &s;miling, and if you
<PB N="14" REF="14">had bu&s;ine&s;&s;es at Law, you would not &s;o frequently think of running over all the be&s;t Treaters of <HI>Paris;</HI> go your ways you idle Fellows, <HI>continu'd he,</HI> one &s;mall grain of folly would not do ami&s;s, to ren|der you a little wi&s;er, and more moderate; you are <HI>Horaces,</HI> and meer Slaves to your pa&s;&s;ions! upon this, they endeavour'd to take him along with them, and all his re&s;i&s;tance had been in vain, if he had not thought on a come off which &s;ucceeded to his mind.</P>
<P>The&s;e trouble&s;ome Men being gone at la&s;t, he plung'd him&s;elf more deeply than ever in the ex|amination of the two <HI>Billets;</HI> and having ea&s;ily rectify'd them by comparing, he ab&s;olutely conclu|ded that there was &s;ome recipro|cal Love, and that he &s;hould do very ill to dive any further in that Mi&s;tery. But who knows not, that it is the weakne&s;s of
<PB N="15" REF="14">the Brave&s;t Souls, to cleave to all that appears the mo&s;t difficult to perform; and the more trouble there is to overcome, the more Glorious &s;eems to them the At|chievement. This Per&s;on made it a point of Honour to pu&s;h this Adventure to the end, and to give him&s;elf up to the government of his good or ill Star; he once more read the la&s;t <HI>Billet,</HI> which was writ in the following terms.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>BILLET.</HEAD>
<P>I <HI>Had fore&s;een that you would make me &s;ome Reproaches, and I might have prepar'd beforehand this An&s;wer for you. I know your ways, and if I mi&s;take not, you pretend to act Souldier-like every where; but learn, that there is a va&s;t difference betwixt to Love, and to Fight, and that a Lover can never Triumph, but in his
<PB N="16" REF="15">Defeat. This is a Le&s;&s;on of which you may profit, if it is not your own fault. Farewell.</HI></P>
<P>Ha! mo&s;t charming unknown Per&s;on, cry'd he to him&s;elf at this conclu&s;ion, what Di&s;po&s;itions &s;hould I find in my &s;elf to obey you? and with what joy &s;hould I become your Scholar? But you already love, and I can|not complain that love has im|printed &s;uch extraordinary charms. While he was thus Philo&s;ophi&s;ing on that Con&s;tellation, his Man, quite out of breath, came to give him an account at large of his Commi&s;&s;ion? He told him, that he knew po&s;itively where that Per&s;on dwelt whom he had fol|low'd, That it was a Royal Pa|lace, abounding in Servants, and that he would conduct him to't when he pleas'd.</P>
<P>This Relation ended, he would
<PB N="17" REF="15">not defer going thither; his Chair|man follow'd his Servant, and great was his &s;urprize to &s;ee him|&s;elf carry'd to the Palace of <HI>Mars,</HI> who&s;e Attendants 'tis likely his Man had taken for Livery-men: He was ready to correct him for his gro&s;s mi&s;take; and if the &s;mall &s;tay which he had made in <HI>Paris,</HI> having been but one week in that City, had not excu&s;ed him, he had at that very moment made tryal of the effect of his ill humour; yet he re&s;olved to &s;ee there that Per&s;on which caus'd him &s;o much trouble.</P>
<P>Nor had he fail'd &s;o to do, if that the &s;ame Curio&s;ity which had drawn her to behold that &s;tately Structure, had not invited her to go el&s;ewhere to do the like al&s;o. He was forced to re&s;t &s;atisfy'd as well as he could; and Mon&s;ieur of <HI>Louis</HI> being but ju&s;t alighted there from <HI>Meudon,</HI> to vi&s;it ac|cording
<PB N="18" REF="16">to his cu&s;tom that Hou&s;e, all who&s;e Inhabitants con&s;ider him as their Patron; he left off his pur&s;uit, to mention his bu&s;ine&s;s to him, and the opportunity be|ing &s;o favourable, he receiv'd from him &s;uch an an&s;wer as he could wi&s;h for, with Orders to go to <HI>Ver&s;ailles</HI> in few days.</P>
<P>This beginning of Love having thus given place to his Ambition, he was punctual to ob&s;erve his Directions, and he receiv'd his brief with &s;uch ea&s;e as is rare to be found with &s;uch Great Mini|&s;ters of State: who to &s;upport him&s;elf again&s;t that envy which is in&s;eparable from his place, &s;eeks but after little other protection, than that which he finds in his Ma&s;ters good will and favour. He gain'd by &s;o generous a proceed|ing, St. <HI>Hubert</HI>'s whole e&s;teem, who had no other regret to &s;ee him in &s;o great an elevation, but
<PB N="19" REF="16">becau&s;e it left him without the power to expre&s;s his acknow|ledgments to him for the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Of truth he is naturally ac|knowledging, and that which fre|quently cau&s;es Men to pa&s;s from Love, to indifferency, does on the contrary, more &s;trongly kindle in him the heat of his pa&s;&s;ion. Wherefore he has never given that way any cau&s;e of Complaint, and it may be &s;aid, that he perfectly knows the Art of Love without that of &s;eigning. That Journey which had acquir'd him a con&s;ide|rable Employ, had not however quite &s;ettled his mind, he had thought him&s;elf unhappy to go for <HI>Nancy,</HI> where his Orders required him to be, without having &s;poken to her who&s;e Orders had been yet more precious to him.</P>
<P>He was returning in his u&s;ual dumps, and was already cro&s;&s;ing the Wood of <HI>Beulogne,</HI> when he
<PB N="20" REF="17">found him&s;elf &s;topp'd by two or three confus'd Voices, mixt with &s;ome breakings forth of Laughter, which &s;eem'd to come from the thicke&s;t part of that Forre&s;t, and by a Picture-Ca&s;e which he per|ceiv'd to &s;parkle in the Mudd, he pre&s;ently alighted, and having taken it up with &s;ome ha&s;te, he was extreamly &s;urpriz'd at the opening of it, to find the Copy of that Per&s;on, who&s;e Original he &s;ought after in all places. He reckon'd much on that rencounter, and believing there would be no hurt in drawing near to that place whence the noi&s;e came, he commanded his people to wait for him.</P>
<P>He had not made many &s;teps, but he perceiv'd the Vi&s;count St. <HI>Hubert</HI> his Cou&s;in, with &s;ome Ladies, which for having been overturn'd in the Dirt, thought they had a great cau&s;e of laughter,
<PB N="21" REF="17">that their fall had not been ac|company'd with any &s;ini&s;ter Ac|cident, and that they were quit of it, for having given as they fell &s;ome ki&s;&s;es to the Vi&s;count. Mean time their Coach being broke, it had been &s;ent back to <HI>Paris,</HI> and they expected another in that part of the Forre&s;t. He then did &s;oon judge that the Picture had been lo&s;t by that accident, and not believing him&s;elf oblig'd to mention it &s;o &s;oon, he offer'd to that fair Company his Coach, to go to <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> where he al&s;o re&s;olv'd to return. The Ladies did long refu&s;e his offer; and had not the Vi&s;count labour'd to make them accept of it, he had been entirely refus'd.</P>
<P>There were four convenient places in it he convinc'd them that he could di&s;po&s;e of his Kin&s;man, and that it would be ridiculous not to improve his offers; where|upon
<PB N="22" REF="18">they having &s;eated them|&s;elves, they continued their way. This diver&s;ion had been concluded on two days before with tho&s;e two Ladies, who had dexterou&s;ly ingag'd St. <HI>Hubert</HI> to accompany them, not but that he had very pre&s;&s;ing bu&s;ine&s;s in Town, where a Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es nicity did oblige him to ob&s;erve very exact mea&s;ures. But being naturally very officious, and they very intimate with him, he had impos'd upon him&s;elf to be of that Match. They were going to give a Vi&s;it to a Mar|chione&s;s, which was to la&s;t &s;ome days. Some days, reply'd the Knight to his Kin&s;man's ear, &s;o &s;oon as he heard it, &s;ome days at <HI>Ver|&s;ailles:</HI> faith, Vicount, I fancy thou wilt have but an ill time of it, and if I am not mi&s;taken, <HI>Paris</HI> would divert thee much better than <HI>Ver&s;ailles.</HI> The Court has &s;ome|what of bu&s;tle in it, <HI>continu'd he
<PB N="23" REF="18">aloud, in a foppi&s;h tone, which fre|quently makes &s;ollitude to be pre|ferr'd to all its Charms; &s;o many Circum&s;tances of cautiou&s;ne&s;s and exactne&s;s are unea&s;ie; and for my part, I never go, but when I think I have &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s there.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this the Ladies di&s;cours'd on the plea&s;ures of the Court, and of the Country, not giving St. <HI>Hubert</HI> any time to an&s;wer, who was almo&s;t dead with de&s;ire to have the Knight clear his Rid|dle; and tho&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es having put him in mind of a Pre&s;ent which he had lately receiv'd, he put his hand to his Pocket, and having not found there what he &s;ought after, he two or three times chang'd Countenance. It was a Bracelet of his Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es hair, which he had obtain'd after divers in&s;tances, the lo&s;s of which, did grieve him mortally.</P>
<P>He pre&s;ently fancy'd that it
<PB N="24" REF="19">might have faln out at that place where they had over-turn'd, and not being able to di&s;gui&s;e his unea&s;ine&s;s, he got out of the Coach &s;o &s;oon as they were at their Journies end, to &s;end People to make an exact &s;earch after it. The Knight who had taken notice of that Concern, believ'd that it was on the account of the Picture, and taking delight to leave in &s;ome trouble a Per&s;on whom he thought too happy, he took no notice of what he had taken up: he &s;aid to him&s;elf, that he might well keep for &s;ome time the Copy of &s;o Charming an Original, who&s;e fir&s;t &s;ight had &s;o violently di&s;turb'd him. Tho&s;e di&s;orders continu'd not long, the pre&s;ence of the Ladies did at lea&s;t impo&s;e &s;ome Con&s;traint on them; and feigning on all hands very cun|ningly, they got to an Inn to re&s;t them&s;elves, cackled more than
<PB N="25" REF="19">ever, and at la&s;t conducted the Gentlemen to the young Mar|chione&s;&s;es Lodgings.</P>
<P>They were no le&s;s &s;urpriz'd the one than the other in approa|ching that Lady; they Saluted her, and the Vi&s;count &s;eeming not to know her, was re&s;olv'd to re|main &s;erious, if the two others could have forborn to Laugh. In this intricacy, the Knight thought there was &s;ome Enchant|ment; and, not knowing what to think of &s;uch an unexpected Ren|counter, was in the greate&s;t a|mazement imaginable, to find that Stranger who had caus'd him &s;o much trouble in the Per&s;on of the Marchione&s;s. He drew near to a Window to clear the bu&s;i|ne&s;s the more; and di&s;tru&s;ting his own Eyes, he drew the Pi|cture out of his Pocket, where he ob&s;erv'd the &s;ame Face, though the Painter had flatter'd never &s;o little.</P>
<PB N="26" REF="20">
<P>While they were je&s;ting with the Vi&s;count on the frolick his Mi&s;tre&s;s had put upon him, in cau&s;ing him to make her a Vi&s;it in a place, whence &s;he was be|liev'd far di&s;tant, he had time to recollect him&s;elf from the di&s;order that &s;urprize had put him in; and contenting him&s;elf with &s;torming again&s;t his ill Fortune, he at la&s;t appear'd le&s;s di&s;countenanc'd than any. Mean time, he return'd a Thou&s;and Thanks to the Compa|ny, for the advantageous Cheat had been put upon him; and all tran&s;ported with joy, as he was, he lo&s;t him&s;elf in the the young Marchione&s;s's Looks, and in the marks of &s;o particular a favour. The Knights pre&s;ence did &s;ome|what re&s;train her fancy on that Article, and though her Lover frequently repeated that he was not to be &s;u&s;pected, &s;he judg'd it convenient not to admit the Vi&s;|count
<PB N="27" REF="20">to the height of Court|&s;hip, and turning the Conver&s;a|tion, on what had happen'd to them on the Road, &s;he then gave clearly to under&s;tand that all had been done by her Command, that &s;he might have time to get fir&s;t to <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> which gave the Count occa&s;ion to &s;ay the plea|&s;ante&s;t things in the World on innocent malice.</P>
<P>Yet would the lo&s;s of his Brace|let come by fits into his Mind, and the Knight, who omitted not to ob&s;erve the lea&s;t alteration in his Face, did &s;ecretly applaud him&s;elf on his happy meeting with the Picture. This joy &s;et him in a very gay Humour, and having drawn near to the beauti|ful Marchione&s;s, he &s;aid &s;o many ingenious and gallant things to her, that the two others were di&s;turb'd at it. He &s;poke to them in their turn al&s;o, and for the
<PB N="28" REF="21">fir&s;t Acquaintance, he had made a very fair Progre&s;s.</P>
<P>This was about the time that a Ballet was to be Danc'd at Court; the Court was to be very Magnificent, and tho&s;e Rejoicings which were but the Preludes to the Carou&s;el, of which &s;o much has been &s;aid, having la&s;ted &s;ome Days to divert &s;ome &s;trange Am|ba&s;&s;adors, it retain'd our Troop there a whole Week al&s;o, after which they return'd to <HI>Paris.</HI> Mean time, the Vi&s;count had had no News of his Bracelet, and the Knight had always in his Mind the advantage which he had over his Love. Yet at la&s;t his Gene|ro&s;ity prevailing over his Intere&s;t, he re&s;olv'd to Sacrifice him&s;elf to his Cozens quiet: He &s;truggled long before he overcame, and taking a firm Re&s;olution to go and clear that Point with him, he would not defer it one mo|ment
<PB N="29" REF="21">longer, for fear of relap|&s;ing into his former weakne&s;s. He gave him an account in few words of all his whole Adven|ture, tho&s;e of the Billets and of the Picture; which he pre&s;ented to him. He a&s;&s;ur'd him, that having been &s;o happy as to ob|tain from Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Louvois,</HI> what he de&s;ir'd, he had no fur|ther thoughts but to return pre|&s;ently, to that place where his Order ingag'd him to repair, and that he de&s;ired nothing from him but to render him&s;elf Depo&s;itary of a Complement for his Mi&s;tre&s;s, in the fear that a &s;econd &s;ight might in&s;pire him with new de|&s;igns. The Vi&s;count ravi&s;h'd with this Genero&s;ity, without Exam|ple, did ha&s;tily embrace him, and ob&s;erving by his Eyes that he &s;poke in good earne&s;t, they both &s;o molified their Bo&s;oms, that they had much to do to avoid
<PB N="30" REF="22">&s;hedding of Tears. They gave to each other a Thou&s;and a&s;&s;urances of Friend&s;hip; and if the Vi&s;count had &s;o far been Ma&s;ter of his Mi&s;tre&s;s's Heart, as to di&s;po&s;e of it in favour of another, he had endeavour'd to have yielded it to him. He afterwards took the Two Billets, the one of his, the other of his Mi&s;tre&s;s's Hand, the Porter having doubtle&s;s mi&s;taken, through the conformity of Names, and the Rencounter, &s;eeing the other had pa&s;s'd but a moment before by the &s;ame place, when he had pre&s;s'd him to be of their little Debauch: As to the Picture, he confe&s;s'd 'twas none of his, but it extreamly re&s;embling his Mi&s;tre&s;s, he &s;o pre&s;t the Knight to go a long with him to clear the bu&s;ine&s;s with her, that at la&s;t he re&s;olved to do it.</P>
<P>They found her in a very neat Dre&s;s, though negligent; and it
<PB N="31" REF="22">was ea&s;ie to be ob&s;erv'd, that if dre&s;&s;ing became her, &s;he al&s;o did very much &s;et off her Dre&s;s by her own Lu&s;tre, by her Air, and by her Shape. She look'd on the Picture with amazement, and made an&s;wer when they would have made it pa&s;s for hers, that it never had been &s;o; that fur|thermore &s;he knew her &s;elf &s;o well, that &s;he would never have re&s;ign'd it into the hands of any Per&s;on capable of &s;o great a neglect. Tho&s;e la&s;t Words were Reproaches to the Vi&s;count, who could not forget the lo&s;s he had made; he was &s;en&s;ibly mov'd at it; and if his Billet had not given him occa&s;ion to convince her of a carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, of which he him&s;elf was but too guilty, he had not deferr'd his own puni&s;h|ment, he re&s;olv'd however not to mention any thing of it to her; and the Knight being fallen into
<PB N="32" REF="23">a Conver&s;ation, in order to ex|plain &s;ome things of the Opera, the Labirinth, and the Ho&s;pital, he then complain'd of the lo&s;s of the Billet, and expre&s;s'd a Re|&s;entment, in which his Con&s;ci|ence was not in the lea&s;t con|cern'd. She got out of that bu&s;i|ne&s;s, with a look that pierc'd him to the very Soul, and which gave him to under&s;tand more than any thing el&s;e, that her tenderne&s;s had not the lea&s;t &s;hare in that accident. That was there|fore an ab&s;olute Command to be &s;ilent, nether did the Knight know what to &s;ay, when &s;he declar'd that the Opera, and the Ho&s;pital of <HI>Mars,</HI> had no part in her &s;tory: That of truth &s;he had been at the Tuilleries that Day he mention'd; and that as to the other circum&s;tances, of having put on her Mask, and retir'd in ano|ther unfrequented Walk to re&s;t
<PB N="33" REF="23">her &s;elf, all that was new to her. That was expre&s;s'd in &s;uch an affirmative accent, that he knew not what to imagine. He &s;ted|fa&s;tly beheld her without &s;peak|ing; and the more he look'd on her, the more he confirm'd him|&s;elf in his Error. Finally, he was quite undeceiv'd by a&s;&s;ured Cir|cum&s;tances, and what pa&s;s'd at fir&s;t in his Mind as a great truth, appear'd to him at la&s;t but as a meer illu&s;ion. He knew not what to conjecture of that Face, that was &s;o re&s;embling that of this Marchione&s;s, he five or &s;ix times felt his own Pul&s;e, to know whether he was not in a Feaver; or at lea&s;t, whether he was not turn'd Vi&s;ionari&s;t: And for fear of turning Wizard at <HI>Paris,</HI> he re&s;olv'd to go out of it the next Day, with his Pi|cture, which he began to find a Thou&s;and times more real
<PB N="34" REF="24">than the Per&s;on which it repre|&s;ented.</P>
<P>He in&s;tantly took his leave of tho&s;e Two Lovers; and having gone towards Night to his Kin&s;|man to bid him farewel, he found him in the re&s;olution to accom|pany him in his Journey. The de&s;ign which had been fram'd on <HI>Luxembourg,</HI> had oblig'd eve|ry Officer to repair to his Po&s;t again&s;t the 15th. of <HI>September.</HI> That oblig'd the Vi&s;count to quit his Mi&s;tre&s;s, to join his Regi|ment that was at <HI>Metz;</HI> he put back their Journey for Three Days, to be&s;tow them wholly on his Mi&s;tre&s;s; after which, they both took Po&s;t in the great Road to <HI>Strasburg.</HI></P>
<P>Every one is &s;ufficiently in|form'd of the fir&s;t Bombarding of that Town; Mon&s;ieur the Mar&s;hal of <HI>Crequi,</HI> having been oblig'd, becau&s;e of the cold Wea|ther,
<PB N="35" REF="24">to put off that Enterpri&s;e till the next Spring; mean time, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing all the Po&s;ts which cut off all Communications, and form'd the Blockado, the Troops retir'd into their Winter Quar|ters, and the Vi&s;count finding him&s;elf at liberty to return to his Amours, or rather to conclude his Marriage with the Marchio|ne&s;s, who had frequently writ to him; he receiv'd one the Night before his &s;etting forth, which overcame him with grief. We have already &s;aid, that &s;he was very nice, and that quali|ty, which &s;he deriv'd more from a &s;trong Pa&s;&s;ion, than any o|ther Principle, had made her to draw con&s;equences which were prejudiciable to her Lover.

<P>I <HI>Was already convinc'd of the levity of Men in General; but I believ'd at lea&s;t that it was not without exception, and that I might tru&s;t your fidelity.

<P>Thrice did he read over the &s;ame Words, to find out a &s;en&s;e contrary to the true one; he as oft examin'd him&s;elf without ap|prehending whence &s;o &s;udden an effect &s;hould proceed; and &s;ome|times believing him&s;elf guilty, then anon again innocent, he fell
<PB N="37" REF="25">into a dumps, out of which he had much ado to retrieve him|&s;elf. All this while his Love re|proach'd him nothing, he found nothing in his pa&s;t conduct that Condemn'd him; but according to that Maxime, that will have the Lover to be always in the wrong, he at la&s;t concluded, that his Mi&s;tre&s;s had all the right imaginable. He was to go ju&s;tify him&s;elf without delay. Scarce did he give him&s;elf time &s;ufficient to go and embrace his Kin&s;man, and to declare to him the nece&s;&s;ity of that precipitation.</P>
<P>This had wi&s;h'd to have return'd along with him, and nothing had prevented him, had not a Family concern, which requir'd his pre|&s;ence, call'd him home. He in|&s;tantly went thither, and finding him&s;elf oblig'd to pa&s;s there part of the Winter, he no longer thought of <HI>Paris</HI> but with &s;ighs.
<PB N="38" REF="26">He had a certain grief at it, which di&s;covering it &s;elf &s;ufficiently on his face, did oblige him to &s;eek after a thou&s;and occa&s;ions to di&s;|&s;ipate it.</P>
<P>He frequently went to Hunt, to which the moderate Climate of his Province did much contribute: he made matches of Diverti&s;e|ments with his whole Neighbour|hood, and thus endeavour'd to recompence him&s;elf in the Coun|trey, of tho&s;e plea&s;ures which he lo&s;t there. A Prote&s;tant Gentle|man, named <HI>Chanlieu,</HI> was one of his fir&s;t acquaintances; he was very agreeable, and the Charms of a Si&s;ter of St. <HI>Hubert</HI> drawing him frequently thither, he found with him wherewith to pa&s;s his time. It is true, that Madmoi&s;elle of St. <HI>Hubert,</HI> taking delight to hear him, had con&s;equently the greate&s;t &s;hare in his Vi&s;its; but after all, the Knight had &s;ome
<PB N="39" REF="26">&s;hare in them al&s;o: and having taken &s;ome of tho&s;e vi&s;its on his own account, he thought him&s;elf oblig'd to return them him. He therefore went to vi&s;it <HI>Chanlisu</HI> in his E&s;tate, and having declar'd that he de&s;ign'd to remain three days with him, the fir&s;t had no other thoughts but to divert him by all manner of means.</P>
<P>Chance did furni&s;h him with one which he could not otherwi&s;e expect; he learnt that St. <HI>Hubert</HI> did pa&s;&s;ionately love Mu&s;ick, and that he might be regal'd by the Ears, as well as by the Eyes. He writ to a friend of his in the next Town, to engage a Select number of Choice Per&s;ons, which de|lighted in Con&s;orts, to come to his Hou&s;e, with all tho&s;e In&s;tru|ments they u&s;ually employ'd with their Voice. <HI>Chanlieu</HI> was a friend tr every body, and his friend nee|ded not to u&s;e much Entreaties to
<PB N="40" REF="27">get their Con&s;ent: He gave notice of it to Madmoi&s;elle of <HI>Chanlieu,</HI> who had been two days in that Town, and having told her that her Brother de&s;ign'd to give an Opera to Mon&s;ieur of St. <HI>Hubert,</HI> &s;he re&s;olv'd to be of the Match, and to agreeably &s;urprize them that way. Madmoi&s;elle of <HI>Chanlieu</HI> who took no notice that mention had been made of Mon&s;ieur, and not of Madmoi&s;elle St. <HI>Hubert,</HI> did really believe that it was &s;he that had come to vi&s;it her; and on the pre&s;&s;ing &s;olicitations of St. <HI>Sauveur,</HI> &s;o was that frien'd nam'd, who was a Gentleman of the Pro|te&s;tant Religion, &s;he no longer deferr'd to go joyn them. Notice was &s;ent to Mon&s;ieur <HI>Chanlieu,</HI> that he &s;hould have cau&s;e to be &s;atisfied, and that his Coach would be expected. Mean time they employ'd their thoughts about what Per&s;ons they &s;hould repre|&s;ent;
<PB N="41" REF="27">and having all met at the Rendezvous, they were plac'd at the end of the Hall; where the form of an Alcove &s;eem'd to re|pre&s;ent a kind of Theatre; at both ends of which, had been &s;u&s;pended two large Sconces, gar|ni&s;h'd with Tapers.</P>
<P><HI>Chanlieu,</HI> which above all did wi&s;h his Mi&s;tre&s;s to partake of this Regalia, had engag'd the Knight to write to her; &s;o that having them both at his Hou&s;e, he in&s;en&s;ibly conducted them to the de&s;ign'd place: after which, the &s;ign being given, the Candles were in&s;tantly lighted, all the In&s;truments began a prelude, very agreeably maintain'd, and the O|pera follow'd with great applau&s;e. The Actors out-did them&s;elves in this Occa&s;ion; but all overcame St. <HI>Hubert,</HI> when he perceiv'd there that face, who had &s;o deeply wounded him at the Opera of
<PB N="42" REF="28"><HI>Phaeton.</HI> His &s;urprize was great at the fir&s;t &s;ight of &s;o agreeable a Company; but he believ'd him|&s;elf in an Enchanted place, when he beheld there that Per&s;on, who began to pa&s;s for an Enchantre&s;s in his thoughts. He drew near to his Si&s;ter to inform him&s;elf more particularly of it, when &s;he left the re&s;t of her Company to come and embrace her, yet &s;ome &s;mall tincture colour'd her face more than ordinary, at the &s;ight of the Knight, who taking no further notice for the pre&s;ent, &s;hew'd his re&s;pects to her.</P>
<P>That friend&s;hip which he per|ceiv'd &s;o great betwixt tho&s;e two Per&s;ons, fill'd him immediately with joy and plea&s;ure; he took his time to approach her, and the Con&s;ort having chang'd into a kind of Ball, he made her a thou|&s;and excu&s;es for not having known her &s;ooner. He told her, after a
<PB N="43" REF="28">gallant manner, that neither his heart nor his eyes had any thing to reproach him with on that ac|count, that &s;he di&s;tingui&s;h'd her &s;elf too much to be deceiv'd, and that no per&s;on could behold her face, without perceiving divers admirable things. He after that did invite her to Dance, and it &s;o falling out according to order, that he was to give her the preference in all re&s;pects; he &s;till entertain'd her mo&s;t agreeably, he ingenuou&s;ly turn'd his Di&s;cour&s;e on the &s;tay &s;he had made at <HI>Paris;</HI> and no longer fearing to be deceiv'd, he felt within him a joy that cannot be expre&s;s'd. He thought there was &s;omething &s;o &s;ingular in his Adventures, that he was wrapt up in admiration of them, as well as the Beauty that had produc'd them; and abandoning him&s;elf blindly to his fate, an ardent pa&s;&s;ion took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his mind;
<PB N="44" REF="29">his eyes did no longer belye his heart, and running over his mi|&s;take, he reproach'd him&s;elf a thou&s;and times for having &s;et up the Marchione&s;s in her place in his mind, and for not having ob|&s;erv'd all that difference which he was &s;en&s;ible of at pre&s;ent. The truth is, they were extream like one another, and that a little more of youth, and &s;oftne&s;s of features, made all the difference.</P>
<P>Mean time abundance of things were in agitation in the bo&s;ome of St. <HI>Sauveur,</HI> he had long &s;ince ob&s;erv'd that Madmoi&s;elle of <HI>Chan|lieu</HI> was the lovelie&s;t Per&s;on in the World, but he had never had any thoughts to love her; he liv'd with her as with a friend, for whom he had a great e&s;teem and friend&s;hip, without any fur|ther Con&s;equences, and it was in this Company that he fir&s;t found a|great alteration in his heart. It
<PB N="45" REF="29">continualy &s;et before his eyes that Object with all its Charms, and his mind being flatter'd at the be|ginning, he took in large draughts of a mo&s;t dangerous Poi&s;on.</P>
<P>Though he was not altogether of &s;o great a Quality as was Mad|moi&s;elle of <HI>Chanlieu,</HI> yet he had &s;ufficiency of Birth, Wit, and Means, to a&s;pire to her Conque&s;t; be&s;ides that, being both of one Religion, he believ'd that &s;ufficient to overcome all Ob&s;tacles. He was naturally very undertaking, &s;o that in hopes to ea&s;ily make her pa&s;s from friend&s;hip to Love, he readily embark'd him&s;elf, and re&s;olv'd to take ju&s;t mea&s;ures. On the contrary, the Knight was ti|mid, and con&s;equently had had but little re&s;t &s;ince his return home; he would frame to him&s;elf &s;trange Mon&s;ters to overcome, and if he had been able, he had dive|&s;ted him&s;elf of a pa&s;&s;ion, which
<PB N="46" REF="30">was to co&s;t him his whole quiet.</P>
<P>Alas! what a difficult thing it is to vanqui&s;h ones &s;elf when one Loves much, and how little &s;ig|nifies a greatne&s;s of Soul again&s;t the power of a violent pa&s;&s;ion? all his &s;truglings were u&s;ele&s;s, and Madmoi&s;elle of St. <HI>Hubert</HI> having ob&s;erv'd a great Change in his Per&s;on, &s;he was forc'd to pre&s;s him very hard, to get from him an acknowledgement of his weak|ne&s;s; No Si&s;ter, &s;aid he to her, Love &s;hall not long be my Ma|&s;ter, I'le be gone to morrow, and Madmoi&s;elle of <HI>Chanlieu</HI>'s Charms &s;hall not have lei&s;ure to rea&s;on on their Victory, after their Triumph over me: Ah! thou beautiful <HI>Hu|gonot,</HI> how Catholick are thy Charms, and your Per&s;on little agreeing with what is told us of your Religion? he had proceeded in his Complaints, had not his Si|&s;ter made a full &s;top there, to
<PB N="47" REF="30">rea&s;on on his pa&s;&s;ion: She lov'd <HI>Chanlieu,</HI> and &s;he having the &s;ame difficulties to Combate in her turn, &s;he repre&s;ented to her Bro|ther, that he too much magnify'd the Objects, and that tho&s;e dif|ficulties that appear'd &s;o great to him, were not however Uncon|querable: that &s;he had formerly much rea&s;on'd within her &s;elf on &s;uch a like matter, and that &s;he had found in it more of fear, than of danger.</P>
<P>Let a Lover &s;ay what he will, he loves &s;till to be flatter'd, and he cannot be heal'd, without cau&s;ing &s;ome &s;orrow to him. The Knight thought him&s;elf oblig'd to her for this Di&s;cour&s;e, and gave her &s;uch acknowledgments of it, as he appear'd not Ma&s;ter of; &s;he on her part had great di&s;po&s;itions to &s;erve him, her intere&s;t was vi&s;ibly engag'd in it, &s;o that &s;he was not to deliberate: &s;he made

<P>St. <HI>Hubert</HI> did frequently go to <HI>Chanlieu</HI>'s, and the Marque&s;s of <HI>Chanlieu</HI> as frequently to the Knight St. <HI>Huberts:</HI> tho&s;e fre|quent Vi&s;its did give &s;ome oppor|tunities to this la&s;t to expre&s;s by his looks what pa&s;s'd in his heart, and his Court&s;hip was always ac|company'd with &s;o Eloquent a langui&s;hment, that it was not dif|ficult to ob&s;erve it.

<P>Wherefore he fore-knowing that ill fate, he manag'd as well as he could all his moments to the be&s;t advantage for his Love, and lo&s;t none of tho&s;e in which he could in anywi&s;e promote his Loves in|tere&s;t.

<PB N="54" REF="35">&s;ome more e&s;&s;ential Proofs of it; &s;he feign'd a &s;mall Indi&s;po&s;ition to obtain a Vi&s;it from that Lady her dear Friend. The Knight adver|tis'd of this, took care to make her a gallant and magnificent Recep|tion; and his inclination agree|ing wonderfully with his love, it may be concluded, that nothing was omitted; and that he procur'd her all the Diverti&s;ements which the &s;ea&s;on would then afford. He appear'd very earne&s;t to expre&s;s to her his Joys, and Madamoi&s;elle of <HI>Chanlieu,</HI> who had already per|ceiv'd his De&s;igns without her Brother's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, did not appear more re&s;erv'd than u&s;ually; She politickly believ'd, that that ought not to dimini&s;h her u&s;ual gaity, and that a Lover ought to under&s;tand him&s;elf in his Conjectures.

<P>St. <HI>Sauveur</HI> who had &s;ubtily in|troduc'd him&s;elf in that Vi&s;it, was wonderfully griev'd at it; he was of late become the Argus and Spye of all their Actions, and finding but too much cau&s;e to fear and to allarm him&s;elf, he lo&s;t the be&s;t part of his gay Humour; not but that he had a particular Empire over him&s;elf to di&s;gui&s;e what pa&s;s'd in the bottom of his Heart; but let one di&s;&s;emble never &s;o much, it is ever certain, that Tenderne&s;s will always manife&s;t it &s;elf in &s;pight of all our greate&s;t caution, and the mo&s;t &s;ubtle Per&s;on, when once grown jealous, cannot long con|&s;train him&s;elf.

<PB N="56" REF="36">from quite another thing.

So many things gave her to apprehend, what &s;he ought to think of the Knight's looks; &s;he had found a great &s;tock of Virtue and Hone&s;ty in his Per&s;on, &s;he knew his Merit; but through all tho&s;e rare Qualities, her budding Love did affright her, and caus'd her to di&s;tru&s;t her &s;elf. For tho' among&s;t Per&s;ons of Quality, Re|ligion is no ob&s;tacle to the &s;tricte&s;t Tyes, in the&s;e latter times &s;he found a great cau&s;e of apprehen|&s;ion; and though Rea&s;on &s;eem'd to advi&s;e her to be inflexible in that ca&s;e, &s;he found not &s;trength enough in her &s;elf to warrant her love and her weakne&s;s; mean time &s;he thought that it were prudence
<PB N="57" REF="36">in her to avoid the danger: She ha&s;tned her return one day the &s;ooner, and took her leave of her Friend, accompany'd with Tears.</P>
<P>But all tho&s;e Flights were u&s;e|le&s;s; Love follow'd her &s;teps, and her Sentiments for the Knight were by half too favourable to her mind: There aro&s;e a Conflict in her Heart, of which the Succe&s;s was very uncertain, and Victory waving a long time, nothing was ab&s;olutely decided; She would willingly have cur'd her &s;elf to the hazard of her own Quiet, and to that purpo&s;e having ca&s;t her Eyes on St. <HI>Sauveur,</HI> &s;he an hundred times re&s;olved to receive him kindly, and as often the Knight's Idea would appear and interpo&s;e in her De&s;igns.</P>

<P>Madamoi&s;elle of <HI>Chanlieu</HI> having had a conveniency while they were taking a turn round the Ca|&s;tle, to &s;atisfie her Curio&s;ity, &s;he was &s;urpris'd to find that Billet in the place of that which &s;he ex|pected; Her mind being piercing and &s;olid, She had thought that her Brother's intere&s;t had carry'd
<PB N="63" REF="39">him to favour the Knight, and that without any further exami|nation, that which he had given her came from him: Having found the contrary at the open|ing of the Billet, &s;he fell into a mu&s;ing, out of which &s;he had much to do to get; the hand of him who had writ it was hnown to her, and her Heart perhaps not agreeing with the Contents of it, &s;he was vex'd with her Brother for having taken upon him a bu&s;ine&s;s which extremely di&s;pleas'd her, and &s;he di&s;pos'd her &s;elf to ill treat them both.</P>
<P>This vexing gave her a &s;ecret cau&s;e to doubt of the fortitude of her Heart, and per&s;uaded her that it was no longer in a &s;tate of making choice; &s;he pre&s;ently bent her anger on St. <HI>Sauveur,</HI> and that proceeding which perhaps &s;he had ea&s;ily forgiven in St. <HI>Hu|bert,</HI>
<PB N="64" REF="40">did vex her mortally; nei|ther did &s;he fail of reproaching to her &s;elf that di&s;tinction which &s;he made, and in repre&s;enting to her &s;elf an hiddeous Picture of Love, wherewith to fortifie her &s;elf again&s;t that which in&s;en&s;ibly attack'd her, &s;he re&s;olv'd to ge|nerally hate all that was Man, and to ince&s;&s;antly oppo&s;e the In|dulgency of her own Temper.</P>
<P>Mean time St. <HI>Sauveur</HI> de&s;irous to learn originally the effects of his Billet, return'd into her A|partment, and was going to ca&s;t him&s;elf at her Feet, when a cer|tain look &s;eem'd to pronounce the Sentence of his Condemnati|on.</P>
<P>He being naturally of an high Spirit, he thought it would too much offend his Honour to de|&s;cend &s;o low; &s;o that turning the bu&s;ine&s;s into a meer Gallantry, <HI>Really Madamoi&s;elle,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>I did

<P>He felt on this occa&s;ion a trou|ble, which join'd to his natural timidity, put him into a great con&s;ternation; he alter'd five or &s;ix times his mind, and at la&s;t having a little &s;etled him&s;elf, and drawn new vigour from the great|ne&s;s of his Love, he broke that Silence which he had for &s;ome time kept, he performed it in a manner accompany'd with an ap|prehen&s;ion which did highly grace the beauty of his Complement.

The Governour, that he might not tax him&s;elf of any neglect, fail'd not in the lea&s;t to any Duty of his function, and ad|ding policy to &s;trength, caus'd in one Night all his Batteries to be rais'd, on certain elevations which command a great Plain; and the

<P>This la&s;t thought had &s;o prevail'd over her mind, that &s;he omitted no means of finding opportunities to favour St. <HI>Sauveur,</HI> and to give him marks of a tenderne&s;s, which &s;he endeavour'd to ravi&s;h from St. <HI>Hubert:</HI> He was privately ad|vertis'd of it by his corre&s;pondent; and if he had not made and amo|rous &s;cruple of accepting of an Heart which was not offer'd him by a Principle of Inclination, per|adventure that he had wholly triumph'd over his Rival, not|with&s;tanding all the Indifferency which was had for him: He therefore complain'd of the man|ner after which he was to be belov'd, and refining on the &s;core of &s;en&s;ibility, he prote&s;ted to her that he preferr'd hatred to &s;uch a kind of Love, that he had &s;tu|died on the nature of tenderne&s;s,

<P>She was oppre&s;s'd with fear, and apprehending the danger greater than it was, her Soul was plung'd into inconceivable trou|bles and agitations: She would &s;ometimes repre&s;ent to her &s;elf

<P>Finally, after having expre&s;s'd great Complaints, they thought they ought to tempori&s;e a little, and that peradventure time would produce then &s;ome unexpected means; that it were better to wait patiently for the time to come, than to torment them|&s;elves through uncertain apprehen|&s;ions.

St. <HI>Sauveur,</HI> could not tell &s;ince that time to what to at|tribute that coldne&s;s which he found in Madmoi&s;elle of <HI>Chan|lieu's</HI> proceeding; and though he valued him&s;elf on the account of Penetration, yet could he not

<P>There is nothing &s;o dangerous as a Lover, who thinks him&s;elf play'd upon by that Per&s;on of whom he is favour'd; his Love frequently degenerates into fury, and nothing is capable to put a &s;top to his fatal de&s;igns. St. <HI>Sauveur</HI>

St. <HI>Sauveur</HI> had always pa&s;s'd for a brave and good Man, incapable of an ill Action, and &s;ome little vanity which he naturally had, did not hinder but that he had acquir'd the Reputation and E&s;teem of gal|lant Men.

<PB N="99" REF="57">having &s;eiz'd his Brain, he fan&s;ied that he had right to revenge him|&s;elf of an uncon&s;tancy, and his de&s;pi&s;ed flame continually offering it &s;elf to his Eyes, he re&s;olv'd in that infatuation, to &s;atisfy him&s;elf at the co&s;t of his Honour and Con&s;cience. So &s;oon as the Per|fume was fini&s;h'd, he fir&s;t made a trial of it on a Wretch, &s;o that being a&s;&s;ur'd of the Succe&s;s, he got the <HI>Italian</HI> to make up the Packet, which he him&s;elf &s;ealed with a counterfeit Cypher of St. <HI>Hubert,</HI> in opinion that the Letter would therefore be open'd with more eagerne&s;s, and being return'd home, he gave order to have it &s;ent to the <HI>Po&s;t-hou&s;e;</HI> after which, being fill'd with black me|lancholy Thoughts, he ab&s;tain'd from &s;eeing her, for fear her pre|&s;ence &s;hould make him to alter his de&s;ign, and went out of a Kingdom where his Con&s;cience

<P>It will be &s;omething &s;urpri&s;ing, to hear that a Per&s;on capable of &s;o much ba&s;ene&s;s, &s;hould quit his Country on a Principle of Reli|gion; but whether through that motive, or through &s;ome other, it is &s;till certain that he retir'd into <HI>Holland,</HI> where he had great Acquaintances, perhaps it was al&s;o, that he would ab&s;ent him&s;elf from a place, where he had been put to &s;uch Trials, and not to be near a Per&s;on that he treated &s;o inhu|manely. He left a Servant behind him, in whom he put great Con|fidence, to give him an account of that Bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;tole away, not taking leave of any body. Divers Per&s;ons were &s;urpriz'd at his di&s;appearing, and Madmoi&s;elle of <HI>Chanlieu</HI> not knowing where to attribute this Retreat po&s;itively, believ'd that an amorous di&s;gu&s;t
<PB N="101" REF="58">might have call'd him to <HI>Paris</HI> to &s;eek after other Diverti&s;e|ments, he having taken that Road to bring him at the <HI>Hague</HI> in <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>He could &s;carce &s;eek after a Retreat more agreeable, and more proper to divert his melancholy Thoughts, both by its curious Si|tuation, and the fine People which u&s;ually meet at the Prince of <HI>O|range's,</HI> who then was &s;eeking af|ter all the means imaginable to put a &s;top to the King's Progre&s;s, which were publickly term'd an Inva&s;ion, and an infraction of the la&s;t Treaties at <HI>Nimeguen;</HI> but Alas! the more he &s;ought to di|vert him&s;elf, the le&s;s he found him|&s;elf in a condition to reli&s;h the lea&s;t Diverti&s;ement; his late Action did continually pre&s;ent it &s;elf to his Mind, and his Rage having given &s;ome place to Rea&s;on, he re&s;ented a torment which afforded
<PB N="102" REF="59">him no re&s;t. In this mortal re&s;t|le&s;ne&s;s, he learnt by his Man's arrival the mi&s;chief which his Perfume had caus'd, in taking away Madamoi&s;elle of <HI>Chanlieu</HI>'s Life with her Beauty; that that Tragedy had &s;urpriz'd divers Per|&s;ons, and that at the fir&s;t noi&s;e of it he had ha&s;tned to join him at the Rendevous. Never was Man more deeply &s;truck than he was at that Relation, he fell into a kind of a Swound, which de|priv'd him of his Sen&s;es, and at la&s;t coming to him&s;elf again, he continued making of reproaches to him&s;elf that mov'd compa&s;&s;ion; he twenty times call'd him&s;elf the Executioner of the faire&s;t Per&s;on in the World; and pa&s;&s;ing from invectives to a giddine&s;s, he &s;e|cretly felt a &s;orrow which de|vour'd him. So many &s;ufferings did at la&s;t alter his Health; he fell into a languidne&s;s, that was
<PB N="103" REF="59">accompanied with an exce&s;&s;ive Feaver, whence he hop'd to receive a perfect Cure.</P>
<P>Mean time, his Man had de|ceiv'd him&s;elf in the relation which he had made him, and that noi&s;e which had been made of the Death of Madmoi&s;elle of <HI>Chan|lieu,</HI> had been found fal&s;e. <HI>La Grange,</HI> who was St. <HI>Sauveur</HI>'s Creature, and who improv'd by his Liberality, having been the fir&s;t that receiv'd that Packet, did not doubt examining the Seal, but that it came from St. <HI>Hubert,</HI> &s;he imagin'd that &s;he &s;hould do a &s;ingular piece of Service to St. <HI>Sauveur</HI> to &s;uppre&s;s it, and make him partaker of its Contents; &s;he open'd it then with great earne&s;tne&s;s, and the Poi&s;on eva|porating at that in&s;tant, made pre&s;ently a pa&s;&s;age for it &s;elf through the Mouth on to the Heart, &s;he made a great out-cry,
<PB N="104" REF="60">which made &s;ome Per&s;ons run to her, but nothing could pre&s;erve her from a &s;udden Death.</P>
<P>No body did imagine that her illne&s;s proceeded from that Paper, which was not &s;o much as minded, nor the Author capable of &s;uch a Crime; it was rather attributed to tho&s;e &s;udden Accidents, which &s;ometimes happen when the lea&s;t thought on. Madmoi&s;elle of <HI>Chan|lieu</HI> was &s;orry at it, and nothing le&s;s than the return of two Per|&s;ons &s;o dear to her could di&s;&s;i|pate her grief: St. <HI>Hubert,</HI> and <HI>Chanlieu,</HI> came very opportunely for her, and &s;he being re&s;olv'd to follow her own tendency, &s;he thought thenceforth to profit by tho&s;e Le&s;&s;ons, which Love had made her during their ab&s;ence.

<P>The Edicts, and the King's new Declarations did then cau&s;e an infinite number of innocent Per|&s;ons to &s;hed tears, and forc'd a great number to flye from a

<P>The Pa&s;&s;ages began to be po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, &s;ince the Squabbles of the Province of <HI>Daulphine,</HI> and &s;he had gladly made u&s;e of St. <HI>Sauveur,</HI> to facilitate her retreat, if it had been po&s;&s;ible; his Crime was &s;till unknown to her, and &s;he had ea&s;ily intru&s;ted her &s;elf to his Cares and Conduct.</P>
<P>She openly chid her Brother on his &s;luggi&s;hne&s;s, and told him things grounded on &s;o firm and Chri&s;tian a Moral, that perad|venture he had re&s;olv'd not to be, of the number of the Tem|pori&s;ers,

<PB N="121" REF="78">of his ill &s;ate in &s;o moving an air, that no body could forbear to Sympathi&s;e with him in his &s;or|row; he was laid in a Bed over|come with grief, and in a Con|dition that mov'd compa&s;&s;ion; he at fir&s;t refus'd all &s;ort of nouri&s;h|ment, but at la&s;t he took a re&s;o|lution worthy of his Courage; for in the thoughts that the Sea might have ca&s;t on Shoar the Body of a Per&s;on &s;o dear to him, he re&s;olv'd to examine all the Coa&s;ts adjacent to the wrack, to enquire after a thing which appear'd &s;o important to his Love; he got to the <HI>Hague,</HI> where he was oblig'd to re&s;t two days, to repair the troubles of his mind; but re&s;t did but increa&s;e his re&s;tle&s;ne&s;s; he found in all places the Per&s;on he hunted after, and Madmoi&s;elle of <HI>Chanlieu</HI> did continually appear be|fore his eyes, his imagination would make him divers repre&s;en|tations of the Shipwrack; which
<PB N="122" REF="79">griev'd him &s;o, that &s;ome times, believing him&s;elf pre&s;ent at that accident, he would frequently ri&s;e on the &s;udden, as if to a&s;&s;i&s;t her whom he thought to &s;ee in the mid&s;t of the waves.</P>
<P>In the heighth of the&s;e his ra|vings, there happen'd an adven|ture in his Inn, which &s;erv'd but to confound him the more; St. <HI>Sauveur</HI> had lodg'd there, during his &s;tay in that Town; and the Knight's appartment had been his. He had taken Ship to go for <HI>Eng|land,</HI> overcome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> remorces, and the negligence of his Man, who had let him forget &s;ome loo&s;e Papers in the corner of a Chamber, behind the Hangings, gave opportunity to St. <HI>Hubert</HI>'s Man to lay his hands on them; among&s;t which, he found a Let|ter, which he gave to his Ma&s;ter; it was a de&s;cription of St. <HI>Sauveur</HI>'s Love, his Pur&s;uits, and his un|fortunate Effects; he there impos'd
<PB N="123" REF="79">on him&s;elf mo&s;t grievous torments, and &s;evere puni&s;hments; and de|clar'd that being unworthy to live after &s;o barbarous an action, he de&s;ign'd to end the re&s;t of his days, in the bottom of &s;ome hor|rid and di&s;mal Wilderne&s;s; that to begin the puni&s;hment of his Crime, he would Publi&s;h it, and by that means, make &s;ome kind of reparation to a Per&s;on whom he had treated with &s;o much in|humanity; the Letter was with|out direction, and concluded with an Eternal farewel, and a&s;&s;urances, that he was going to end the re&s;t of his days in &s;ome hollow Cave in the I&s;le of <HI>Carolina.</HI></P>
<P>The Knight was not long be|fore he found the &s;ence to this Letter, which was de&s;ign'd for <HI>La Grange,</HI> on whom all the ill fate of that Enterprize had fallen; he doubted not but that this un|fortunate Lover was the Author of a death which had made &s;ome
<PB N="124" REF="80">noi&s;e, and that he had attempted on a Per&s;on, who&s;e lo&s;s had &s;o &s;oon follow'd his pernicious practi|ces. He &s;ixt him&s;elf after the manner of the ancient <HI>Romans</HI> to &s;eek for her Body, to render his la&s;t Duties to tho&s;e Relicks which he ador'd; and following his way, he made the mo&s;t exact perqui|&s;ition after it that could be ima|gin'd.</P>
<P>When he was got at <HI>Roan,</HI> he learnt, that not long &s;ince five or &s;ix dead Bodies had been taken up in the <HI>Downs,</HI> and particularly that of a Woman, who doubtle&s;s was a Per&s;on of Quality, by tho&s;e Jewels which had been &s;ound in the &s;olds of her Cloathes. That News accompli&s;h'd his de&s;pair; he did intreat of the Commander that he might take her up again to make a Funeral worthy of her; and his Love in&s;piring him with Thoughts full of di&s;traction, did retain him long in a place
<PB N="125" REF="80">which was &s;o grievious to him, &s;o that he had much to do to get from it to return home.</P>
<P>Madmoi&s;elle of St. <HI>Hubert</HI> pre|&s;ently perceiv'd that there was &s;omething more than ab&s;ence in his Mind, and his Tears having made her to hit on the right cau&s;e, &s;he made loud Complaints, which oblig'd <HI>Chanlieu</HI> to come and take his &s;hare, in the cruel de&s;tiny of a Per&s;on that was &s;o dear to them all.</P>
<P>The Knight in the mid&s;t of &s;o many Condolances, believ'd that he &s;hould better and with more pa|tience bear with his &s;orrow in &s;uch places where he had never &s;een his charming Mi&s;tre&s;s, and the King &s;ending then &s;ome &s;uc|cour to the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> again&s;t the Inhabitants of the Vallies, whom he accus'd to have given protection to his Fugitive Sub|jects, he was of the number of tho&s;e Officers that were Com|manded
<PB N="126" REF="81">for that Expedition: His departure was no longer accom|panied with tho&s;e troubles which are caus'd by &s;eparation from a Mi&s;tre&s;s; he had then &s;uch as were much more grievous to bear, and the &s;weet hopes to &s;ee again what one loves had no place in his Brea&s;t. He at every moment re|pre&s;ented to him&s;elf Madamoi&s;elle of <HI>Chanlieu</HI> dead and buried, and the &s;atisfaction of that remem|brance did but increa&s;e his for|row. In that conflict of Thoughts, there happen'd one very &s;urpri|&s;ing, which was that he believ'd, in going to make his Campaign the Gho&s;t of that illu&s;trious Per|&s;on would reproach his Conduct, and would blame him for having made War again&s;t Per&s;ons that were of her Religion.</P>
<P>That con&s;ideration did &s;tay him in the Province of <HI>Dauphine;</HI> be|&s;ides he being not over much prepo&s;&s;e&s;t with the Opinions of
<PB N="127" REF="81">the Catholicks, he found that they acted with too much ri|gour again&s;t innocent Per&s;ons, which were charged with imagi|nary Crimes. That Languidne&s;s which he had contracted, furni&s;h|ing him with means to feign an Indi&s;po&s;ition, he obtain'd to be tran&s;ported to <HI>Grenoble</HI> to recover his Health; where having not found the Air conformable to his melancholy humour, he afterwards cho&s;e <HI>Marfeilles,</HI> the Governour of which place he particularly knew; and finding that Sea-port to his mind, he re&s;olv'd to re&s;ide there.</P>
<P>His particular delight was the walk on the Key, where at every hour there are &s;een Ships come in loaded with Curio&s;ities. Be&s;ides, he impos'd it as a Law to him|&s;elf, to frequently reproach the Sea of her unju&s;tice, and to ask it an account of the Murther
<PB N="128" REF="82">which it had committed; he never did &s;ee any &s;trange Ve&s;&s;els come in, but he inform'd him&s;elf of the Road they had come, and that which they de&s;ign'd to keep, and preferring that Diver&s;ion to all tho&s;e which others would have procur'd him, he would &s;tay in the Citadel no longer time than needed, not to appear ridiculous.</P>
<P>The Governour, who thought him&s;elf oblig'd to Divert him, omitted nothing to that purpo&s;e, wherefore he made Matches in con&s;ideration of him. And the plea&s;ure which the Knight took to be on Ship-board, having obli|ged the Governour to invite him one day at Dinner on one of the large&s;t that was in the Harbour; he was interrupted by an Officer, who gave him notice, that one of the Vi&s;itors had found &s;ome Prote&s;tant Subjects on a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ve&s;&s;el, which the Storm had forc'd in. That news was unplea&s;ing
<PB N="129" REF="82">to him, but the Orders of the Court being very preci&s;e on that account, he order'd that they &s;hould be pre&s;ently brought to him: But how great was St. <HI>Hu|bert</HI>'s &s;urpri&s;e at their coming! he thought he &s;aw among&s;t them Madmoi&s;elle of <HI>Chanlieu;</HI> and taking for a fanta&s;m, what doubt|le&s;s was a real Body, he fancied him&s;elf to be in an Inchanted I&s;land, or that at lea&s;t this Ad|venture was nothing but a Dream. His Heart was in a continual throbbing, and in that uncer|tainty of his good fortune, he knew not what Party to take. His Eyes were &s;o wild, and his Thoughts &s;o confus'd, that he &s;carce knew him&s;elf; yet he found him&s;elf no longer liable to mi|&s;takes; his Love had taught him the difference there was be|twixt her and all the re&s;t of the World, and the Vi&s;counte&s;s could no longer make him mi&s;take.
<PB N="130" REF="83">He drew near to the Gover|nour, who knew all his Con|cerns, to offer to him his doubt, at that very moment that he was throughly inform'd by a look full of Reproaches: He pre&s;ently run to ask her pardon for his tardi|ne&s;s, and having inform'd her of the Rea&s;ons, he continu'd to ex|pre&s;s to her a joy full of tran|&s;ports.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ence of &s;o many Per|&s;ons could not but be trouble&s;ome to two reviv'd Lovers. The Governour left them alone, to ta&s;te with le&s;s con&s;traint the ef|fects of a faithful and tender Pa&s;|&s;ion; during &s;ome time they ex|pre&s;s'd them&s;elves, but with a &s;i|lence, in which they confounded their looks: They a thou&s;and times interrupted one another with Que|&s;tions; St. <HI>Hubert</HI> ca&s;t him&s;elf at her Feet, as to return her thanks that he found her alive again, af|ter he had no longer doubted of
<PB N="131" REF="83">her Death. He would ask her, whether it was really her &s;elf, or whether it was her &s;hadow only that was come to comfort him for her lo&s;s; he anew did cara|cteri&s;e to her the mo&s;t tender parts of his Love; and having much to do to expre&s;s him&s;elf in &s;o happy a juncture, he gave her time to make this following Relation.</P>
<P><HI>You know,</HI> Knight, <HI>to what condi|tion our &s;eparation did reduce me, and how troubled my Soul was at our parting, I felt it yet more &s;en|&s;ibly than I expre&s;s'd it; and if I had not flatter'd my &s;elf of &s;eeing you again one day, perhaps my en|terprize had fallen &s;hort, and I had gone no farther. Ah!</HI> Madamoi|&s;elle, interrupted <HI>St.</HI> Hubert, <HI>that is too much for me, or rather it is &s;ufficient to make me die for Love; I ble&s;s my Fate,</HI> added he, ki&s;&s;ing mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionately her Hand, <HI>and I no longer doubt, after I have found you again, but that the Heavens will

<PB N="132" REF="85">remove all ob&s;tacles which are op|pos'd to my entire felicity.</HI> Then re|turning to examine, whether there was not &s;ome illu&s;ion in what that day had produc'd of &s;uch a mira|cuious nature, he &s;hew'd by his Actions a flame mo&s;t pure and mo&s;t violent. <HI>Happen what will,</HI> he would &s;ay again with pa&s;&s;ion, <HI>after I have believ'd you dead, Love has pre&s;erv'd my Life, but to live happy for the future, and my bli&s;s is to be envied.</HI> He had gone on in his Tran&s;ports, if &s;he had not let him know, that &s;he would end her Narrative while they were alone, and that his Love was for a time to give place to his attention.</P>
<P><HI>I had &s;ome fore-knowledge of my misfortune,</HI> continued &s;he, <HI>by cer|tain Circum&s;tances which preceded it, and which began to make me find the difference of the two Ele|ments: Tho&s;e Fi&s;her-men to whom you had intru&s;ted me, did not appear to
<PB N="133" REF="85">me made like other Men; they had in their looks &s;omething of roughne&s;s, which made me to fear &s;ome ill de&s;ign; neither did they fail of improving the occa&s;ion which had been offer'd them, and their terrible barbarous nature inclining them to ca&s;t us into the Sea, it was a miracle that they were &s;atis|fy'd with our Money only, with threat|nings to kill us, or to deliver us into the Inqui&s;itors hands. I had by chance caus'd my Jewels to be &s;ew'd up in the folds of my Cloaths, which I had made the Maid that &s;erv'd me to put on, and which by that means were &s;av'd from the plunder. The&s;e Pirates having put us on board the Pa&s;&s;age-boat, I felt &s;ome inconveniences, which, join'd to my &s;orrow, took almo&s;t all manner of knowledge from me: The Sea, and the agitation of the Waves having made me &s;uffer much, I was not in a condi|tion to ob&s;erve what happen'd after. I only remember, that after I had heard great &s;hrieks and outcries, I fell into a deep Swoon, which hindred
<PB N="134" REF="86">me from &s;eeing that evil which hap|pen'd to us: I at la&s;t found my &s;elf in a little Bed, &s;erv'd by a Man who was not unknown to me; and ca&s;ting about my wild looks, I had not the power to ask neither where I was, nor what they de&s;ign'd to do with me; I call'd however five or &s;ix times for my Wo|man; and I recover'd again from a langui&s;hment, which made me find more &s;orrow in Life than in Death.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He who had taken care of me, came then and ca&s;t him&s;elf on his knees near my Bed, and ask'd me a thou&s;and Pardons, in a manner worthy of pity and compa&s;&s;ion; he prote&s;ted to me, that if the Heavens had not given him &s;trength in &s;aving me out of the Sea, to pre&s;erve a Life which he thought he had taken from me, that he never had dar'd to appear before me; and that if Repentance de&s;erv'd that what was pa&s;t &s;hould be forgotten, there never had been one more &s;in|cere than his, nor follow'd with greater remor&s;es.</HI></P>
<PB N="135" REF="86">
<P><HI>This confe&s;&s;ion made me think there was &s;ome mi&s;take, and that I my &s;elf was deceiv'd, in taking the Per&s;on who &s;poke to me for St.</HI> Sau|veur; <HI>I made him to expound him|&s;elf again, and &s;o &s;oon as he had in|form'd me of the &s;ecret of his Action, I let him know that I was not in a Condition to owe any ill will to any body; that I hop'd in a &s;hort time to be rid of the&s;e evils which overcame me, and that without any con&s;ideration to tho&s;e Services which he had lately render'd me, I did freely forgive him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>At that moment another faint|ne&s;s took me, which troubled him: Mean time the Storm &s;till continu'd, and we had got the fourth Day to the heighth of</HI> Tangier; <HI>the fifth the Wind chang'd, and permitted us to pa&s;s the</HI> Streights, <HI>to go Land in</HI> Spain <HI>in the neare&s;t Harbour. Our Ship, which was bound for</HI> Lon|don, <HI>finding it &s;elf in the</HI> Mediter|ranian <HI>Sea, re&s;olv'd to go to</HI> Ge|noua
<PB N="136" REF="87"><HI>to take in &s;ome Goods on the account of the Merchants; but the Sea, which &s;eem'd to oppo&s;e it &s;elf to all our De&s;igns, kept us &s;hut up at</HI> Valencia <HI>during three whole Months: There I &s;uffer'd all that could be imagin'd; and if that St.</HI> Sauveur <HI>had not continued his Cares towards me, I believe that I had not e&s;cap'd the Waves, but to die pre&s;ently after on Land. He found out a Maid to &s;erve me, and gave Money to the Captain of the Ve&s;&s;el to lend me, not daring to offer me any him&s;elf. It was then that he related to me all that his Enterprize had made him to &s;uffer, and that thinking him&s;elf un|worthy to live, he was re&s;olv'd to go to</HI> Carolina, <HI>there to pa&s;s his Life like a true Hermit; that in that de&s;ign he had took Shipping for</HI> England, <HI>but that the Packet-boat having &s;tricken again&s;t their Ve&s;&s;el in the Road, it had been broke to pieces, the Storm not permitting &s;o much as to &s;ave the Crew: That I
<PB N="137" REF="87">had happily fa&s;ten'd my &s;elf to a Plank, which the Waves had ca&s;t on their Deck, and &s;o had pre&s;erv'd me from an unavoidable danger; he added, that mov'd with Compa&s;&s;ion, he him&s;elf had carried me into a Cabbin, near to two</HI> Dutch <HI>Women, whom he intreated to take care of me, and to put me into a Bed, af|ter which he came to know me a|gain, when he was bringing &s;ome Cordials to comfort me; that he had long doubted of the reality of this Adventure, and that he never was fully convinc'd of the Truth till he had heard me &s;peak. At this Recital he &s;hed Tears, which mov'd me, whatever I could &s;ay, that this la&s;t Action did &s;ufficiently repair all that a too violent Pa&s;&s;ion had formerly in&s;pir'd him with to my di&s;|advantage; his Melancholy increas'd, by which he contracted &s;uch a &s;or|row, which kill'd him in few days.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I confe&s;s to you, that I was affli|cted at it, and that he had at lea&s;t
<PB N="138" REF="88">the &s;atisfaction in dying, to perceive the &s;orrow which his lo&s;s caus'd in me: We being in a Country, whence he could draw no Con&s;olation but from him&s;elf, I thought it nece&s;&s;ary for me to &s;ee him, and I dare &s;ay that he was overjoy'd in tho&s;e la&s;t Moments, to hear me pray to God for him; he had oblig'd me to look after his Money, with which he had pre&s;ented me in the time of nece&s;&s;ity, which I accepted not, but on condi|tions to return it to his neare&s;t Re|lations. Thus did I &s;ee expire a Per|&s;on, who had given me different oc|ca&s;ions of Love and Hatred to|wards him. I was &s;o accu&s;tom'd after that Death to &s;uffer whatever Fortune prepar'd for me of good or evil, that I look'd without the lea&s;t concern on the wrong which &s;he thought to have made me, in ca&s;ting us from the Coa&s;t of</HI> Italy, <HI>whence we were not far, into this Harbour, which appears to me &s;afe, through the plea&s;ure which I receive
<PB N="139" REF="88">to find you here, and to &s;ee you again with the &s;ame generous Sen|timents of which you had given me &s;uch fair Proofs.</HI></P>
<P>St. <HI>Hubert,</HI> impatient in his turn, to give her an account of his &s;ufferings, and of tho&s;e troubles he had endur'd, related to her all his Travels, and omitted nothing of what could give her &s;trong Ideas of his pa&s;&s;ion; he then found that at <HI>Roan</HI> he had taken the Maid for the Mi&s;tri&s;s, and that it had been an hard piece of bu&s;ine&s;s not to have been deceived; be&s;ides tho&s;e Cloaths which he had met with at the <HI>Jewry</HI> at <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> and all the other Circum&s;tances, did but too much confirm him in his be|lief; &s;o that he lookt as a Miracle on the return of a Per&s;on, who according to all appearance had been &s;wallow'd up by the Sea, he would have given her new Te&s;ti|monies of his Love, when the Governour came in, and expre&s;s'd
<PB N="140" REF="89">the &s;hare he had in their mutual joy.</P>
<P>He bid them afterwards con|&s;ider what mea&s;ures to take, before he gave advice at Court of her &s;ei&s;ure; that it was of great im|portance to take them very exact, and then leaving his friend Ma&s;ter of his fair Pri&s;oner, with the means to &s;ee one another, he dimini&s;h'd by that generous act all that could remain in them of &s;orrow and vex|ation. According to all appearance there was but little remedy to be found to wholly free them&s;elves from troubles, and had &s;he not re&s;olv'd to di&s;pute of Religion with him, at that time he intended to &s;peak of nothing but of Love, per|adventure that &s;he had never &s;een an end of her mi&s;eries.</P>
<P>She was perfectly in&s;tructed in the Roman, as well as in her own, and the Knight being accu&s;tomed to hear her frequently decide di|vers Controverted points, he began
<PB N="141" REF="89">to receive that which proceeded from her delicate mouth as O|racles, and at la&s;t was of Opinion, that in &s;pight of his Director he might enter into a particular exa|mination of his Belief. That hard u&s;age again&s;t the poor Prote&s;tants had already given him &s;ome Ideas of their Innocence, and of the In|ju&s;tice of their Cau&s;e, he a-new con&s;ulted his own Con&s;cience, and pierc'd by tho&s;e In&s;tructions that were given him, he believ'd that without allowance to his Love, he ought to be of the Religion of that Per&s;on whom he &s;o tenderly lov'd.</P>
<P>Madmoi&s;elle of <HI>Chanlieu</HI> had never yet felt &s;uch a pure joy, as that which this Conver&s;ation af|forded her; her heart was &s;o pleas'd at it, that &s;he &s;carce could manage its motions, &s;he let him know that it was by that way only, that he had made an end of Conquering her, and that in time &s;he &s;hould give him the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t
