<HEAD>A COVRANTE OF NEWES FROM THE EAST INDIA.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A true Relation of the taking of the Ilands of <HI>Lan|tore</HI> and <HI>Polaroone</HI> in the parts of <HI>Banda</HI> in the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies</HI> by the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> which Ilands had yeelded them&s;elues &s;ubiect vnto the King of <HI>England.</HI> Written to the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Company in <HI>England</HI> from their Factors there.</HEAD>
<P>ABout the Month of December 1620. the Dutch Generall hauing prepared a force of 16. &s;hips, declared to our <HI>Pre&s;ident,</HI> that he intended an exploit for the good of both Com|panies, without mentioning any particulars of his de&s;ignes.</P>
<P>And &s;eeing vs to haue no &s;uch forces ready to ioyne with him, he &s;ayd he would attempt it alone. And the third of Ianuary. 1620. he did &s;et &s;ale from <HI>Iaquatra</HI> with his &s;ayd forces, and arriued at <HI>Banda</HI> about the third of February following.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ently vpon his arriuall he made great prepa|ration again&s;t the Iland of <HI>Lantore,</HI> which Iland was formerly by the inhabitants thereof deliuered ouer vnto our people for the v&s;e, and vnder the &s;ubiecti|on of the <HI>Kings Maie&s;tie</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> whereof our Captaine of the Ile of <HI>Polaroone</HI> had taken po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion and had al&s;o &s;etled a factory there.</P>
<P>When our chiefe Factor in our &s;ayd Ile of <HI>Pola|roone</HI> heard of the purpo&s;e of the Dutch Generall again&s;t the &s;ayd Ile of <HI>Lantore,</HI> he wrote a letter vn|to
<PB N="2" REF="2">the &s;ayd Generall, adui&s;ing him that the &s;ayd Ile of <HI>Lantore</HI> did belong vnto the King of <HI>England,</HI> and that therefore hee &s;hould not attempt any vio|lence again&s;t it, &s;eeing there is an accord made in England betweene vs. Which letter, the &s;ayd Ge|nerall threw from him in a great rage &s;carce vouch|&s;afeing to reade it ouer, and cau&s;ed the Me&s;&s;enger to be thru&s;t out of doores, requiring him to adui&s;e our Factor of <HI>Polaroone</HI> pre&s;ently to &s;end to <HI>Lan|tore;</HI> and fetch away all &s;uch of our people and goods as were vpon that Iland; for whom&s;oeuer he &s;hould find there: he would take them as his vtter enemies, and they &s;hould fare no better then the in|habitants.</P>
<P>And within ten or twelue dayes after he landed all his forces there, &amp; &s;ubdued the &s;aid Iland. So long as the fight endured, our Factors and feruants there (being three <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and eight <HI>Chineces</HI>) kept them|&s;elues within doores, and afterwards our people came out of their hou&s;es, and told them, the hou&s;e wherein they were, was the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> hou&s;e, and that therefore they &s;hould not meddle therewith.</P>
<P>Neuerthele&s;&s;e they &s;acked our hou&s;e, tooke a|way all our goods, murthered three of our <HI>Chines</HI> &s;eruants, bound the re&s;t (as well <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> as <HI>Chine&s;&s;es</HI>) hand &amp; foote, &amp; threatned the~ to cut their throats binding them three &s;euerall times to &s;euerall &s;takes with their weapons ready drawne out, and did put a halter vpon our principall Factors necke, draw|ing vp his head, and &s;tretching out his necke, ready to put them to death, yet did not execute them, but as they were bound hand and foote (as afore&s;ayd) tumbled them downe ouer the rockes like dogs,
<PB N="3" REF="2">and like to haue broken their neckes, and thus bound, carryed them aboord their &s;hips, and there kept them pri&s;oners in Irons 14. or 16. dayes.</P>
<P>After the conque&s;t of the Iland of <HI>Lantore</HI> the Dutch Generall threatned to doe the like vnto <HI>Po|laroone</HI> wherefore our principall Factor of <HI>Po|laroone</HI> being there but newly arriued, went vnto the Dutch Generall vnto the ca&s;tle of <HI>Nera,</HI> and told him that he heard that he purpo&s;ed to take <HI>Pola|roone</HI> by force, which hee could not beleeue, al|though his owne me&s;&s;enger &s;ent to <HI>Polaroone</HI> to &s;peake with our Factors, had giuen it out al&s;o, that the General him&s;elfe &s;hould &s;ay, that if the Engli&s;h did not come pre&s;ently vnto him &amp; yeeld the &s;ayd fort of <HI>Polaroone</HI> vnto him, he would &s;end his forces, and ouer-run all the countrey, but hoped he would enterprize no &s;uch thing again&s;t that place, con&s;ide|ring the Articles of agreement, and knowing how many yeeres (to the great lo&s;&s;e and charge of the company) we held po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and maintained the place to the v&s;e of his Maie&s;ty of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ayd Generall made little an&s;wer to it, as though there were no &s;uch matter intended, where|upon our &s;ayd Factot tooke his leaue &amp; came away.</P>
<P>But the next day hee was followed to <HI>Polaroone</HI> with and <HI>Armado</HI> of 26. <HI>Prowes</HI> &amp; one &s;hip, which did put the inhabitants of <HI>Polaroone</HI> in &s;uch a feare, as they knew not what to do; whereupon our chiefe Factor there asked the commander of tho&s;e forces, what his purpo&s;e was with &s;uch a fleete there, and that if he attempted any thing again&s;t <HI>Polaroone,</HI> it was a breach of the Articles it being in our po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion. This could not preuaile with him, but &s;ayd the
<PB N="4" REF="3">land was theirs, and they would haue it by faire meanes or force, and as for our profe&s;&s;ion, they would not acknowledge it (the inhabitants and not we being mai&s;ters of the place) and &s;o the Dutch Commander went a &s;hore vnto the inhabitants.</P>
<P>Whereupon the &s;aid inhabitants asked vs if we could and would defend them, but perceiuing wee were not able to defend our &s;elues, much le&s;&s;e to &s;ecure them: they were forced to yeeld them&s;elues and the Iland into his hands.</P>
<P>The Dutch tooke downe the Engli&s;h colours, and &s;et vp their owne, and cau&s;ed the inhabitants pre&s;ently to bring in all their weapons, and to throw downe all their walles, and would haue for|ced them to haue taken all our Ordnance out of our Fort, which they at the fir&s;t refu&s;ed to doe, al|leding that they had formerly giuen and &s;ur|rendred the land to the King of England, and in re&s;pect they had liued &s;o long with the Engli&s;h, they would not now offer vs any iniury or vio|lence.</P>
<P>And when our chiefe Factor went a &s;hore to ex|po&s;tulate the matter with the Dutch Comman|der, he could obtaine nothing at his hands, but that the land was theirs, and things mu&s;t bee &s;o, and &s;hould be &s;o.</P>
<P>Whereupon our &s;ayd Factor went again vnto the Dutch General to the ca&s;tle of <HI>Nera</HI> to conferre with him thereabouts, but he would giue no other an&s;wer, but that he had referred tho&s;e bu&s;ine&s;&s;es to his &s;ayd Lieutenant &s;ent thither, with whom hee might conferre: who in the ab&s;en&s;e of our &s;ayd chiefe Factor, had brought &s;ome of his &s;ouldiers a
<PB N="5" REF="3">&s;hore vpon <HI>Polaroone,</HI> and forced the Ilanders to throw all our Ordnance ouer the rocke from the place where they were planted (being nine peeces) whereof foure broke with the fall, and were all car|ryed away by the Dutch.</P>
<P>Moreouer our Captaine of <HI>Polaroone</HI> who had defended the Iland foure yeeres together going to <HI>Lantore</HI> (at the reque&s;t of the inhabitants) to receiue the &s;urrendry thereof for our Kings Maie&s;ties v&s;e (as afore&s;aid) and returning backe againe about the beginning of <HI>Nouember</HI> 1620. was &s;laine by the Dutch. And it is very probable, they did it after the time they had intelligence of the publication of the accord at <HI>Bantam</HI> in <HI>March</HI> 1619. For pre&s;ently vpon the &s;aid publication, they &s;ent &s;ecretly to the Ilands in tho&s;e parts, where they had trade, to pre|uent vs of our part of the &s;pices due vnto vs by the accord.</P>
<P>After the &s;aid Dutch Generall had &s;ubdued the fore mentioned Iland of <HI>Lantore,</HI> he con&s;trained them to deliuer vnto him, the principall of all their children for ho&s;tages: Then he tooke away from them all their &s;mall ve&s;&s;els and boats, and then he al&s;o required all the men of <HI>Lantore</HI> to be brought vnto him, and they brought him all the prncipall men, but this did not &s;atisfie him, but he would haue al the <HI>Bandine&s;&s;es,</HI> which had ayded them, as al|&s;o all their wiues and children, &s;mall and great to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">e brought as pri&s;oners aboord his &s;hips.</P>
<P>Which when the <HI>Bandine&s;&s;es</HI> perceiued doubting <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">hat he meant to make them all &s;laues and to carry
<PB N="6" REF="4">them to &s;ome other places) they agreed together to retire them&s;elues into the highe&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t pla|ces of the land, and there did fortifie them&s;elues, whereupon the Dutch &s;lue of them and tooke 1200 per&s;ons pri&s;oners, mo&s;t of them being women and children, which they haue&s;ince carryed to <HI>Iaquatra</HI> and other places.</P>
