<P>I Pre&s;ume to Pre&s;ent to Your Royal View the Fir&s;t Volume of my Second Voyage into <HI>A&s;ia;</HI> not &s;o much to give it Credit by &s;o Ambi|tious a Dedication, as to acquit my Self of an In|di&s;pen&s;able Obligation upon me to Offer to Your Maje&s;ty the Fir&s;t-Fruits of a Work, whereof the Publication is a Debt &s;olely due to Your Maje&s;ty from me.</P>
<P><PB REF="4">
I can &s;incerely affirm to Your Maje&s;ty, That it is the Product of Your Royal Grace and Goodne&s;s to me; and that the chief Motive I had to under|take it, was, Becau&s;e I perceived it to be a Subject well-plea&s;ing to Your Maje&s;ty, being Compo&s;ed under the Shadow of that Augu&s;t Throne which Your Maje&s;ty does &s;o Gloriou&s;ly repleni&s;h: Nor had I taken &s;o much time from the Nece&s;&s;ary Oc|cupations of my Life, to propo&s;e it for the Pre&s;s, but out of an earne&s;t de&s;ire to publi&s;h to the World the Re&s;entments of my Heart, for the many Fa|vours I have received from Your Maje&s;ty, and my Admiration of Your Maje&s;ties Heroick and Tran|&s;cendent Virtue.</P>
<P>From the time that the Bounty of Heaven had ble&s;&s;ed me in the happy Choice I made of e&s;tabli&s;h|ing my &s;elf in this <HI>Land of Promi&s;e,</HI> quietly to en|joy in it the de&s;irable Fruits of my long Travels, I was alway Graciou&s;ly received by the late King of ever ble&s;&s;ed Memory who as a Mark of His E&s;teem was plea&s;ed to Honour me with a Character of Dig|nity. And the Nobility, who of them&s;elves are &s;o Affable and Generous, were not wanting in their Civilities to me, to imitate &s;o admirable a Pattern of all Illu&s;trious Virtues.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t Celebrated Societies in Your Maje&s;ties Kingdom, have done me the Honour to admit me into their Bodies; and I was by Soveraign Autho|rity imploy'd in a mo&s;t Important Negotiation with the Neighbor-State: But though I received &s;o many great Effects of His Maje&s;ties Bounty to me, I am in Duty bound for many Rea&s;ons to apply the Ac|knowledgment thereof to Your Sacred Maje&s;ty, which may be comprehended in that perfect Union which Your Maje&s;ty had with that Great and Good
<PB REF="4">
King, in participating with him not only in the mo&s;t Important Affairs of his happy Reign, but even in the lea&s;t and meane&s;t of his Cares, whereby Your Maje&s;ty hath a ju&s;t Title to &s;hare in all the Gracious Acts of his Royal Beneficence.</P>
<P>The particular and immediate Te&s;timonies of Favour which Your Maje&s;ty (of Your own Per&s;o|nal Goodne&s;s) hath extended to me, are too nume|rous to be related; and I am defective in words to de&s;cribe the Gratitude wherewith my Heart is po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed in the &s;en&s;e of them: Wherefore in this my Incapacity to expre&s;s my Re&s;entments of Your Ma|je&s;ties Benefits to me, I am le&s;s able to Delineate tho&s;e Heroick Qualities which all <HI>Europe</HI> admire in Your Maje&s;ties Sacred Per&s;on, and which enable Your Maje&s;ty with &s;o much Renown to &s;u&s;tain that Glorious Crown which is deriv'd to Your Ma|je&s;ty from Your Mighty Ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>I have had the <HI>Honour</HI> to approach Kings, which pa&s;s abroad for the Mightie&s;t Monarchs in the World; but none of tho&s;e Magnificent Images of Divinity, are equal to Your Maje&s;ty in the Divine Re&s;em|blances of Affability, Courte&s;ie, Vigilance, Know|ledge and Con&s;tancy. None of them ever brought &s;uch Con&s;ummate Experience to the Government of a great and mighty Empire, or was ever po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd with &s;o much Ju&s;tice and Fortitude to uphold or augment it: None of them have ever joyn'd to the Science of Commanding on Land, &s;uch va&s;t and exqui&s;ite Knowledge in Maritime Affairs as well for War, as the Art and Improvement of Navigation.</P>
<P>I might advance farther in this Parallel, where Your Maje&s;ty has &s;o much the advantage, if I did not find my Eyes dazled, when I attempt to fix them upon Your Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P><PB REF="5">
I have indeed taken the Liberty in the Volumes which are to &s;ucceed this, (and perhaps not been altogether unhappy therein) to give the Chara|cters of the mo&s;t famous Monarchs of the <HI>Ea&s;t:</HI> But though my Zeal for Your Maje&s;ties Glory is very great, I find my Force at pre&s;ent too weak to ex|pre&s;s that of Your Maje&s;ties, in &s;o illu&s;trious a man|ner as the Merit of the Subject requires. However, I may endeavour hereafter to attempt it; and in the mean time I &s;hall continue my Prayers to Al|mighty GOD, <HI>That Your Maje&s;ties Reign may be Long and Pro&s;perous; and that Your Throne may be always an Inviolable Refuge and Sanctuary to the Op|pre&s;&s;ed, and Your Scepter as Immoveable in the Hearts of Your Subjects, as in Your Triumphant Hands; and that in the End for an Accumulation of Glory, Your Maje&s;ty may &s;ecure and pre&s;erve an Accumulation of Felicity to Your People.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e are the Addre&s;&s;es which &s;hall be A&s;&s;idu|ou&s;ly made at the Throne of Grace for Your Sacred Maje&s;ty, by,</P>
<CLOSER>May it plea&s;e Your Maje&s;ty,
<SIGNED>Your Maje&s;ties mo&s;t Humble, mo&s;t Obedient, and mo&s;t Faithful Subject and Servant,

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>

<P>_THis is the Fir&s;t Part of my Relations of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> which I have divided into Four Vo|lumes, whereof the Fir&s;t (which is this I now Publi&s;h) contains that part of the Journal of my Voyage from <HI>Paris</HI> to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> which ends in the Month of <HI>June</HI> in the Year <HI>1673.</HI> I think it Needle&s;s in this place to Anticipate the Readers Expectation with Reciting any of the Particulars of it, becau&s;e the whole is Delivered at large in the en|&s;uing Treati&s;e.</P>
<P><PB REF="6">
The Second Part (which is the re&s;t of my Journal of the Year <HI>1673)</HI> contains a General De&s;cription of the Empire of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and its Force, together with the Laws, Governments, Manners and Cu&s;tomes of the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> of their Arts and Sciences, and their Civil and Mechanical Indu&s;try, with a particular De&s;cription of <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> (which is at this time the Capital City of that va&s;t Empire) and Five and Thirty or Forty Cuts Engraven in Copper, of the faire&s;t and mo&s;t Remarka|ble Buildings therein, or other Eminent Particularities thereof.</P>
<P>The Third Part (which is my Journal of the Year <HI>1674)</HI> contains (among&s;t other things) the Ruines of <HI>Per&s;epolis,</HI> repre&s;ented in Twenty Two Copper-Plates, as al&s;o an Exact, and Ample De&s;cription of them, with Ob&s;ervations Interwoven of the le&s;s Intelligible Parts of tho&s;e Ruines, (which are the mo&s;t Glorious Monu|ments and Noble&s;t Remains of Antiquity Extant) together with a Relation of the Religion of the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> collected as well from their Publick Wor&s;hip, as their Writings, whereof there are many Copious Traductions.</P>
<P>The Fourth and la&s;t Part (which con&s;i&s;ts of my Journal of the Year <HI>1675.</HI> and the two &s;ucceeding Years) concludes with a Piece wholly new and unknown to &V;s in <HI>Europe,</HI> which is an Abridgement of the Hi|&s;tory of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> Extracted from their own Writings.</P>
<P>And thus having informed the Reader of the Subject of my Memorials, I &s;hall mention &s;omething of the time, and means which I imployed to collect them.</P>
<P>I Travel'd by Land to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> in the Year <HI>1665,</HI> and arrived in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> at the beginning of the Year <HI>1666.</HI> where I &s;tayed all that Year, and a good part of the next.</P>
<P><PB REF="6">
I came back to <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> from <HI>India</HI> in the Year <HI>1669.</HI> where I remain'd Six Months before my return to <HI>Eu|rope.</HI> This was my fir&s;t Voyage. And though I then provided my &s;elf of Ob&s;ervations, and all &s;orts of Ma|terials for a Relation of it, in as great a Degree or perhaps greater than tho&s;e that have vi&s;ited tho&s;e Coun|tries before me (having Learn'd many things from the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Languages, which have not been ob&s;erv'd by any that have hitherto Writ of <HI>Per&s;ia,)</HI> yet I did not then think my &s;elf &s;ufficiently in&s;tructed for the Publication of &s;o compleat a Work, as I intended. But in the mean time I entertain'd the World with a little Treati&s;e of the Coronation of <HI>Soliman,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ome few Curious matters of Fact, whereof I was an Eye-Witne&s;s. And the earne&s;t de&s;ire I had to improve my knowledge in that va&s;t Empire of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> to be enabled to produce to the World u&s;eful and Ample Relations of it, induced me to undertake a Second Voyage thither, which I did in the Year <HI>1671.</HI> (as the &s;ame will appear in this Journal,) I &s;tay'd there until the Year <HI>1677,</HI> chiefly following the Court in its Removals, but likewi&s;e I made &s;ome particular Journeys, as well of Curio&s;ity as Bu&s;ine&s;s, to pro&s;ecute my intentions, &s;tudying the Language, and a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly frequenting the mo&s;t eminent and mo&s;t knowing Men of the Nation, the better to inform my &s;elf in all things that were Curious and New to us in <HI>Europe,</HI> concerning a Country that may well be called, <HI>Another World,</HI> both in re&s;pect of the Di&s;tance of place it has from us; and the different Manners and Maximes of it. In a Word I was &s;o &s;olicitous to know <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> that I knew <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> better than <HI>Paris</HI> (though I was Bred and Born there.)</P>
<P>The <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Language was as ea&s;ie to me as <HI>French,</HI> and I could currently Read and Write it, I had often
<PB REF="7">
Travell'd, through the whole Country in the Length and Breadth thereof, and &s;een its Seas (both the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> and the <HI>Ocean)</HI> from one end to the other; I have vi&s;ited its Frontiers in <HI>Armenia, Iberia</HI> and <HI>Media,</HI> and <HI>Arabia</HI> al&s;o, as far as the River <HI>Indus,</HI> and have been &s;o exactly inform'd of tho&s;e few Places where I have not been, that I am confident I could know them (if I may &s;o &s;ay) upon any &s;udden Tran&s;porta|tion thither; which I &s;ay only to let the Reader &s;ee what Ground he may have to rely upon the Truth of the following Relations.</P>
<P>As for this Tran&s;lation, I &s;hall not &s;ay much of the Expre&s;&s;ions and Phra&s;e u&s;ed in it, being no competent Judge thereof, but I can aver that it was done under my In&s;pection, and I have review'd it with Attention, and Knowledge enough to affirm, that it is exactly my Sen&s;e, but I mu&s;t not omit to mention, that in my Revi&s;ion of it, there was &s;carce a Leaf where I did not di&s;co|ver &s;ome con&s;iderable Fault, as a Parenthe&s;is, Line or Word omitted, and &s;ometimes my Thoughts imper|fectly rendered, (though the &s;ub&s;tituted Sen&s;e was nei|ther Incongruous nor Perplexed.) In brief, I have Cor|rected many Mi&s;takes of this &s;ort, which could not be Perceptible to any but an Author, who carries the Sen&s;e of his Work, Word by Word in his Head.</P>
<P>As for Example, in de&s;cribing the Cultivation of the Vineyards of <HI>Colchide,</HI> I &s;aid, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On taille la vigne tous les quatre Anns une fois.</NOTE> That they cut their Vines there, once in every four Years; and my Tran&s;lator had expre&s;&s;ed it, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">As if I had &s;aid, <HI>On taille la vigne quatre fois en un An.</HI></NOTE> That they cut their Vines four times every Year. One cannot &s;ay that this proceeded from a defect of Sen&s;e, or want of &V;nder&s;tanding the <HI>French</HI> Tongue, for he knows it
<PB REF="7">
well, and is otherways a Man of Letters, and has quickne&s;s of Thought, and is very able for &s;uch Works; but Mi&s;takes are inevitable in long Tran&s;lations: And as I believe that this of my Book is nearer the Original than any Ver&s;ion that I have &s;een of other Voyages, &s;o I am convinc'd that there are no Tran&s;lations wherein many Errours may not be found again&s;t the Sen&s;e of the Authors.</P>
<P>The <HI>Copper Plates</HI> are done by different <HI>Gravers,</HI> which will not happen in the others of my Volumes, where all of them will be Engraven by that Hand which has done the Draught of <HI>Tauris,</HI> and Nine or Ten other <HI>Figures.</HI></P>
<P>I have Written nothing of the <HI>Indies,</HI> becau&s;e I li|ved but five Years there, and under&s;tood only the <HI>Vul|gar Languages,</HI> which are the <HI>Indian</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> without the Knowledge of that of the <HI>Brachmans,</HI> which is the proper and nece&s;&s;ary Organ to arrive at the Knowledge of the Wi&s;dom and Antiquity of the <HI>Indians:</HI> but neverthele&s;s I did not altogether wa&s;te my Time there in Idlene&s;s: On the contrary, as the <HI>Winters</HI> in that Country will not permit One to Travel, I imploy'd that time in a Work which I had long in my Thoughts, and which I may call, <HI>My Favourite De&s;ign,</HI> by the Plea&s;ure wherewith I laboured in it, and the Profit which I hope the Publique will receive thereby; which is certain Notes upon very many Pa&s;|&s;ages of the Holy Scriptures, whereof the Explication depends on the Knowledge of the Cu&s;toms of the <HI>Ea&s;tern Countries,</HI> for the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> is the Scene of all the Hi|&s;torical Facts mentioned in the <HI>Bible.</HI> The Language of that <HI>Divine Book,</HI> (e&s;pecially of the <HI>Old Te&s;ta|ment)</HI> being <HI>Oriental,</HI> and very often Figurative, and Hyperbolical, tho&s;e Parts of the <HI>Scripture</HI> which
<PB REF="8">
are Written in Ver&s;e, and in the Prophecies, are full of Figures and Hyperboles, which, as it is manife&s;t, can|not be well under&s;tood without a Knowledge of the Things from whence &s;uch Figures are taken, which are Natural Proprieties, and Particular Manners of the Countries to which they refer; I di&s;cern'd this in my fir&s;t Voyage to the <HI>Indies:</HI> For I gradually found a greater Sen&s;e and Beauty in divers Pa&s;&s;ages of the Scriptures than I had before, by having in my view the Things either Natural or Moral, which explain'd them to me, and in peru&s;ing the different Tran&s;lations, which the greate&s;t part of the Tran&s;lators of the <HI>Bible</HI> had made, I ob&s;erv'd that every one of them (to render their Expo&s;itions (as they thought) more intelligible) u&s;ed &s;uch Expre&s;&s;ions as would accommodate the Phra&s;e to the Places where they Writ; which did not only ma|ny times pervert the Text, but often render'd the Sen&s;e ob&s;cure, and &s;ometimes ab&s;urd al&s;o. In fine, con&s;ulting the Commentators upon &s;uch kind of Pa&s;&s;ages, I found very &s;trange Mi&s;takes in them, and that they all along gue&s;s'd at the Sen&s;e, and did but grope (as in the Dark) in the &s;earch of it. And from the&s;e Refle|ctions, I took a Re&s;olution to make my Remarks upon many Pa&s;&s;ages of the Scripture; per&s;wading my &s;elf that they would be equally Agreeable and Profitable for u&s;e. And the <HI>Learned,</HI> to whom I Communicated my De&s;ign, Incouraged me very much (by their Commen|dations) to proceed in it: And more e&s;pecially when I inform'd them, That it is not in <HI>A&s;ia</HI> as in our <HI>Europe,</HI> where there are frequent Changes more or le&s;s, in the Forms of Things, as the Habits, Buildings, Garden|ings, and the like. In the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> they are con&s;tant in all Things; The Habits are at this Day in the &s;ame Manner, as in the Precedent Ages; So that one may rea&s;onably believe, That in that part of the World, the
<PB REF="8">
Exteriour Forms of Things (as their Manners and Cu&s;toms) are the &s;ame now, as they were Two Thou|&s;and Years &s;ince, except in &s;uch Changes as may have been Introduced by Religion, which are neverthele&s;s very Incon&s;iderable.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Notes</HI> upon the <HI>Bible</HI> will be the la&s;t Things which I &s;hall expo&s;e to the <HI>Publick,</HI> unle&s;s I &s;hall un|der&s;tand that they are de&s;ired &s;ooner: In which ca&s;e I may Publi&s;h by Advance, tho&s;e I have made upon the Book of <HI>Gene&s;is</HI> for a Ta&s;te of the re&s;t. And the &s;ame de&s;ire which I have to Gratifie the World, and particularly the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, to which I have &s;o many Obligations, will induce me to Publi&s;h the Third or Fourth Part of my <HI>Relations</HI> before the Second, if I &s;hall find that they are de&s;ired and expected before it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Book&s;eller</HI> was de&s;irous to add to this <HI>Volume</HI> the Piece which is to be &s;een at the End of it, which contains, <HI>A Relation of the Solemn Coronation of the Pre&s;ent King of</HI> Per&s;ia; whereof I was an Eye-Witne&s;s my &s;elf about Twenty Years ago, and which I cau&s;ed to be Printed at <HI>Paris</HI> Five Years after, at my Fir&s;t Return from my <HI>Travels.</HI> And though I can|not but &s;ay that the <HI>Narrative</HI> is Faithful and Exact, yet I mu&s;t confe&s;s that it is too Diffu&s;e, and often In|terwoven with &s;uch &s;mall Incidents, as I would have omitted, could the <HI>Book&s;eller</HI> have been prevailed with to wait the Publi&s;hing of it till after That of my Second Journey.</P>

<HEAD>THE TRAVELS OF Sir John Chardin INTO PERSIA, <HI>Through the</HI> Black-Sea, <HI>and the Country of</HI> Colchis.</HEAD>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>_I Departed from <HI>Paris,</HI> with an Inten|tion to return to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> the Seventeenth of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1671, ju&s;t Fifteen Months after I came from thence. I undertook this tedious Journey a &s;econd time, as well to perfect my &s;elf in the Knowledge of the Languages, the Cu&s;toms, the Religions, the Trades and Sciences, the Commerce and Hi&s;tory of the Oriental People as to en|deavour the Advancement of my Fortunes and E&s;tate.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="11">
I found at my Return into <HI>France,</HI> that the Religion wherein I had been Educated made me incapable of all &s;orts of Imploy|ment; and that it was requi&s;ite for me either to change it, or altogether to renounce whatever is call'd Honour and Prefer|ment. Both the one and the other &s;eem'd to me to be &s;ome|what &s;evere: for we are not at liberty to believe what we plea&s;e. Thereupon I pre&s;ently bethought my &s;elf of return|ing to the <HI>Indies,</HI> where, without altering my Religion, or abandoning the Condition of a Merchant, I could not fail to gratifie a moderate Ambition: for Trade is there an Imployment &s;o con&s;iderable, that even Soveraign Princes pub|lickly follow it.</P>
<P>The decea&s;ed King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> made me his own Merchant, by his Letters Patents in the year 1666. and gave me in charge to order the making of &s;everal Jewels of a great value, of which his Maje&s;ty de&s;ign'd the Models with his own Hands.

<P>While we &s;taid for a Wind in the Port of <HI>Micona,</HI> there ar|riv'd in that Haven two Fir&s;t-Rate <HI>Venetian</HI> Men of War. They enter'd in the Night-time.

Port, to weigh and be gone before Day. Two were there at that pre&s;ent time. They &s;et Sail early the next Morning, and came to an Anchor behind a Promontory, not above a League from the Port. The Admiral was a Nobleman of <HI>Venice,</HI> to whom I gave a Vi&s;it, and de&s;iring to know the rea&s;on of his firing the Rocquets, he told me he had Or|ders &s;o to do; for that the Republick being engag'd to the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> by the Treaty at <HI>Candy,</HI> to clear the <HI>Archi|pelago</HI> of all the Chri&s;tian Rovers, and to take as many of 'em, as they could, yet in regard of the &s;everal good Services which the Rovers had done the Republick in the la&s;t War, he took that cour&s;e to &s;atisfie the Port, without acting to the pre|judice of the Rovers. And this was the rea&s;on that the Ships of the Republick were oblig'd always to make them&s;elves known in the <HI>Archipelago</HI> to the end the Chri&s;tian Pyrates might keep at a di&s;tance from 'em, and not approach within ken; that &s;o they might be &s;aid not to have had any &s;ight of 'em. In the Day-time, added he, we are known by our Co|lours; but in the Night, when we enter any Port, we let off the&s;e Rocquets; and &s;ometimes al&s;o we &s;end certain Officers a&s;hore, to di&s;cover whether there be any Chri&s;tian Rovers in Port, and &s;o give 'em Notice to be gone.</P>
<P>I arriv'd at <HI>Smyrna</HI> the &s;eventh of <HI>March</HI> 1672, after being four Months at Sea. In which tedious Voyage we endur'd much Cold, and many a boy&s;trous Storm. We were in want of Victuals; nor could we have made this Voyage with more Danger or more Hard&s;hip</P>
<P>I &s;hall not trouble my &s;elf to make any De&s;cription of <HI>Smyrna,</HI> where I found nothing worthy Remark, or in any other part of the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> more than what is to be found in the Relations of <HI>Spon,</HI> and other Travellers, Men of Learning and Exactne&s;s, who have been there &s;ince my time. I &s;hall therefore content my &s;elf with recounting &s;ome Particulars re|lating to Commerce and Hi&s;tory, of which they have not &s;poken.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h drive a great Trade at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> and over all the <HI>Levant.</HI> This Trade is driv'n by a Royal Company &s;et|led at <HI>London;</HI> which is Govern'd after a mo&s;t prudent man|ner, and therefore cannot fail of &s;ucce&s;s. It has &s;tood almo&s;t the&s;e hundred Years, being fir&s;t Confirm'd towards the middle of Queen <HI>Elizabeth's</HI> Raign. A Raign famous for having, among other Things, giv'n Life to &s;everal Trading Compa|nies, particularly tho&s;e of <HI>Hamborough, Ru&s;&s;ia, Greenland,</HI> the
<PB N="5" REF="12">
<HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> and <HI>Turkie,</HI> all which remain to this Day. Trade was then in its Infancy; and there is no greater Mark of the Ignorance of tho&s;e Times, in reference to Countries, though but a little remote, then the A&s;&s;ociation which tho&s;e Mer|chants made: for they joyn'd &s;everal together in one Body, for mutual Conduct and A&s;&s;i&s;tance. That Company which relates to the Turki&s;h Trade, is of a particular &s;ort: For it is not a Society, where every one puts in a Sum for one General and United Stock: It is a Body which has nothing in Com|mon, but a peculiar Grant and Priviledge to Trade into the <HI>Levant.</HI> It a&s;&s;umes to it &s;elf the Name of <HI>The Regulated Com|pany.</HI> None are admitted into it, but Sons of Merchants, or &s;uch as have &s;erv'd an Apprentice&s;hip to the Trade, which in <HI>England</HI> is for Seven Years. They give to be admitted into the Society about an Hundred and Twenty Crowns, if under the Age of Twenty Five Years; and double if above that Age. The Company never commits to any one &s;ingle Per&s;on their Power, nor the &s;ole Management of their Affairs, but manage their Bu&s;ine&s;s among them&s;elves by the Plurality of Voices. So that who has &s;ufficient to drive a Trade that will bear an Im|po&s;ition of Eight Crowns, has as good a Vote as he that Trades for an Hundred Thou&s;and. This A&s;&s;embly, thus <HI>Democratical,</HI> &s;ends out Ships, Levies Taxes upon all their Commodities, pre&s;ents the Amba&s;&s;ador whom the King &s;ends to the <HI>Port,</HI> Elects two Con&s;uls, the one for <HI>Smyrna,</HI> the other for <HI>Aleppo,</HI> and prevents the &s;ending of Goods which are not thought proper for the <HI>Levant.</HI> It con&s;i&s;ts at pre&s;ent of about Three Hundred Merchants, be&s;ides that they bring up in <HI>Turkie</HI> a great number of young Per&s;ons well de&s;cended, who learn the Trade upon the Place it &s;elf. This Trade amounts to about Five or Six Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds yearly, and con&s;i&s;ts in Cloaths made in <HI>England,</HI> and Silver which they carry as well out of <HI>England,</HI> as out of <HI>Spain, France</HI> and <HI>Italy:</HI> In exchange of which they bring back Wool, Cotton-Yarn, Galls, Raw Silk and Wov'n, together with &s;ome other Commodities of le&s;s value. Now the <HI>Company,</HI> finding that Malice which In|tere&s;t begets among Per&s;ons of the &s;ame Profe&s;&s;ion, would in time be the Ruine of their Society, by Enhancing or Loring the price of Goods on purpo&s;e to under-&s;ell one another; and that the &s;ame Malice cau&s;es the Merchants to be at variance with the Con&s;uls, the Con&s;uls with the Amba&s;&s;ador; (which is the rea&s;on that many times where Expences are requi&s;ite, an un&s;ea&s;onable Stingine&s;s in the Amba&s;&s;ador cau&s;es great Impo&s;i|tions

and Fines, and other &s;evere Vexations to the Nation) The Company, I &s;ay, fore&s;eeing the&s;e Mi&s;chiefs, have pru|dently provided a Remedy to prevent 'em. For the Engli&s;h Cloth, of which they &s;end into <HI>Turkie</HI> about Twenty Thou|&s;and Pieces yearly, and the chiefe&s;t part of the re&s;t of their Merchandize is &s;ent to the Factors with a Bill or <HI>Invoice</HI> of the Price at what they are bound to &s;ell; together with ano|ther Bill of the Price certain for tho&s;e Goods which they give order to be bought; and by that means it never happens that the Merchants receive any Damage in the Pro&s;pect or De&s;ign of their Profit.</P>
<P>For the prevention of the&s;e and other di&s;orders, the Company gives a Pen&s;ion to the Engli&s;h Amba&s;&s;ador, who re&s;ides at the <HI>Port;</HI> to the <HI>Con&s;uls,</HI> and all their Principal Officers, as the Mini|&s;ter, the Chancellor, the Secretary, the Interpreters, the Jani&s;aries and others. Which Officers have no Power to Levy any Taxes or Sums of Money upon the Merchandize, whether under the pretence of Duties, or Pre&s;ents, or any other extraordi|nary Expences. But when any thing of that Nature is to be done, they give Notice to the Deputies of the Nation, who are Two Per&s;ons appointed to Act in the Name of the re&s;t. The&s;e Deputies examine and debate with the Amba&s;&s;ador, or the Con&s;ul, What is fit to be given, What Journeys are ne|ce&s;&s;ary to be made to the <HI>Port,</HI> and what is there to be tran&s;|acted: Not but that the Amba&s;&s;ador or Con&s;ul may not Act of them&s;elves, but they ob&s;erve that method to acquit and ju&s;tifie them&s;elves; and &s;ometimes upon Emergent and Ex|traordinary Affairs they a&s;&s;emble the whole Body of the Na|tion. So &s;oon as they are come to a Re&s;ult, the Deputies give Notice to the Trea&s;urer to provide what is nece&s;&s;ary, whe|ther it be Money, Toys or Curio&s;ities. This Trea&s;urer al&s;o is &s;etl'd by the Company, and provides Money for every thing, di&s;charges punctually all manner of Charges and Ex|pences, and pays exactly the Wages of every Officer. Thus the Amba&s;&s;ador and Con&s;uls have no more to do but only to mind the Security of the Engli&s;h Nation, and the good of Trade without being incumber'd and diverted by their own Intere&s;ts. There are al&s;o many other excellent Regulations and Orders for the &s;upport of their Trade in the <HI>Levant;</HI> by which means they carry it on with Honour and Profit beyond any of their Neighbors.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="13">
The Hollanders al&s;o drive a great Trade at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> and more then any other Nation of <HI>Europe,</HI> but they have lit|tle to do el&s;ewhere; all their Dealing in all the re&s;t of the Cities in the <HI>Levant</HI> amounting to little or nothing. Their principal Profit con&s;i&s;ts in carrying the <HI>Armenians</HI> and their Goods into <HI>Europe,</HI> and carrying 'em back again. They al|&s;o make great Advantage of their Money, of which <HI>Turkie</HI> is very full. This Money of theirs is made of ba&s;e Mettle, and notoriou&s;ly intermix'd with Counterfeit pieces. It chief|ly con&s;i&s;ts of Crowns, Half-Crowns, <HI>Te&s;tons,</HI> or Eighteen|penny pieces, and pieces of Fifteen <HI>Sous.</HI> The Crowns and Half-Crowns for the mo&s;t part carry the Dutch Stamp. Which the Turks therefore call <HI>A&s;lani,</HI> that is to &s;ay <HI>Lyons;</HI> in regard of their being mark'd on both &s;ides with the Figure of a Lyon. The Arabians, either out of Ignorance or otherwi&s;e, mi&s;tak|ing the Lyon for a Dog, give em the Name of <HI>Abou-Kelb,</HI> or <HI>Dogs.</HI> The Quarter-Pieces are almo&s;t all Counterfeit; or at Be&s;t, but Half Silver. However the Turks are &s;o void of Judgment and Under&s;tanding, that they e&s;teem this Mony beyond that of <HI>Spain,</HI> which they call <HI>Mar&s;illies,</HI> by rea&s;on that the Merchants of <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> fir&s;t brought it in great Quan|tities into <HI>Turkie.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>States</HI> maintain a <HI>Re&s;ident</HI> at the Port, with an Allow|ance of Four Thou&s;and Crowns a Year. Which <HI>Re&s;ident</HI> has be&s;ides the one Moyety of the Revenue of the Dutch Con|&s;ul&s;hips in the <HI>Levant,</HI> which &s;ometimes amounts to a con&s;i|derable Sum; there being one Dutch Con&s;ul at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> who got Fifty Thou&s;and Crowns by Duties. When I arriv'd there, it happend that there was a great Quarrel between the Con&s;ul and the Merchants: For he accus'd them for Cheats; Appeal|ing to their own Books for the truth of his Affirmation; and de&s;ir'd they might be view'd; to which the Merchants would by no means give their con&s;ent. The <HI>Re&s;ident</HI> not daring to determine this Difference, both Parties referr'd them&s;elves to the <HI>States.</HI> But at la&s;t, for fear the coming of the Convoy, &s;hould occa&s;ion farther di&s;turbances, the Merchants and the Con&s;ul agreed the Duties of the Con&s;ul&s;hip, at Ten Thou|&s;and Five Hundred Crowns, for all that the Convoy brought in, and Shipt off.</P>
<P>The French are very numerous in <HI>Smyrna,</HI> and over all the <HI>Levant,</HI> there not being a Port of <HI>Turkie</HI> upon the <HI>Mediterra|nean</HI> Sea, wherein there are not &s;everal. They are for the mo&s;t part all <HI>Proven&ccedil;alls.</HI> But the Trade which they drive is
<PB N="8" REF="14">
&s;o incon&s;iderable, that one Merchant in each Place might di&s;|patch all the Bu&s;ine&s;s. At <HI>Smyrna,</HI> for example, there are a|bove a Hundred Merchants; and yet the Truth is, that in &s;ome Years the Effects that came out of <HI>France</HI> con&s;ign'd to all tho&s;e Merchants did not amount to above Four Hundred Thou&s;and <HI>Livres;</HI> and there are many that have not above Five Hun|dred Crowns Stock: Be&s;ides that they agree but very badly together, as being a &s;ort of people that Love to harbour Divi|&s;ion and Contention one among another. So that it is no wonder if their Trade decrea&s;e, and turn to lo&s;s rather then profit. For they who better under&s;tand the Nature and Maxims of Trade, affirm, That that &s;ame Di&s;-union is the Thing which ruins'em in the <HI>Levant;</HI> &s;o that if we &s;hould compare the pre|&s;ent with the former Trade which they drove, we &s;hould find it more mi&s;erable and pitiful then ever. They add moreover that the <HI>Proven&ccedil;alls</HI> have formerly had in <HI>Turkie</HI> tho&s;e fortu|nate Chances and Luckie Opportunities, that it is highly to be wonder'd, that they did not fill their Country with Wealth in that happy Conjuncture. One of tho&s;e Lucky Sea&s;ons be|gan about the Year 1656, and la&s;ted Thirteen Years, during which time they drove a Trade, by which they gain'd Four|&s;core and Ninety <HI>per. Cent.</HI></P>
<P>This Trade which was really and truly a great piece of Kna|very con&s;i&s;ted in the&s;e <HI>Five-Sous-Pieces</HI> that have made &s;uch a Noi&s;e. For the Turks took the fir&s;t that were brought at Ten Sous apiece: At which rate they held up for &s;ome time; tho afterwards they fell to Seven <HI>Sous</HI> and a half. There was no other Mony Stirring: All <HI>Turkie</HI> was full of it; nei|ther was there any other Mony to be had; for that the French carri'd all the other Money away. This good Fortune &s;o intoxicated their Sen&s;es, that not content with &s;uch great Gains, they &s;till thir&s;ted after more; and to that purpo&s;e they &s;et them&s;elves to alter their own pieces of <HI>Five Sons,</HI> and made others of the &s;ame &s;ort, but of ba&s;e Mettle, which they Coin'd fir&s;t at <HI>Dombes,</HI> then at <HI>Orange,</HI> and afterwards at <HI>Avignon.</HI> More then this, they Stampt far wor&s;e at <HI>Monaco</HI> and <HI>Florence:</HI> And la&s;tly they made more of the &s;ame Stamp in the remote Ca&s;tles belonging to the <HI>State</HI> of <HI>Genoa,</HI> and other private places, which were only Copper plated over. The Merchants of <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> to utter this Money, brought down the price them&s;elves, and put off their Pieces in payment, and to the Mony-Changers at a lower Rate then the Current Value. The Turks were a long time before they perceiv'd the
<PB N="9" REF="14">
Cheat that was put upon 'em, though &s;o palpable and of &s;o great a Con&s;equence; but &s;o &s;oon as they found it out, they were &s;o incens'd, that they laid mo&s;t heavy Impo&s;itions upon the <HI>French,</HI> u&s;ing 'em no better then Counterfeiters of Money, though the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Genoe&s;es</HI> had a hand in it as well as they. Thereupon they forbid 'em to utter any of tho&s;e Pieces which they call'd <HI>Timmins,</HI> but &s;uch as were &s;tamp'd with the real Arms of <HI>France,</HI> which they al&s;o brought down and put at Five <HI>Sous</HI> apiece. So that all the <HI>European</HI> Merchants, ex|cept the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> were loaded at that time with great Quan|tities of tho&s;e <HI>Timmins.</HI> Their Warehou&s;es were full, whole Ships Loadings of 'em arriv'd daily, and they began to Coin 'em in all parts. But &s;oon after, this Money being cry'd down, &s;everal of tho&s;e Money-Merchants lo&s;t all their Gains, and many much more then ever they got.</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were the Procurers of this Decry. For had that Money continu'd Currant, their Trade had been ruin'd, which con&s;i&s;ted chiefly in the purcha&s;e of Silks. And the rea&s;on was, becau&s;e the Timmin-Merchants caus'd an advance to be made upon the price of Silks, not caring what they gave, provided the Sellers would take their Pieces of Five <HI>Sous</HI> in payment. I have &s;een above Fifty &s;everal &s;orts of Coins of this &s;ort of Money. But the mo&s;t common &s;ort carri'd on the one &s;ide a Womans Head with this <HI>Motto, Vera Virtutis Imago:</HI> On the other, the Arms of <HI>France,</HI> with this Impre&s;e, <HI>Currens per totam A&s;iam.</HI></P>
<P>There are no People in the World that have been more fre|quently cheated, or that are more ea&s;ily gull'd then the <HI>Turks;</HI> as being naturally very dull, and thick-skull'd, and apt to believe any fair Story: Which is the rea&s;on that the Chri&s;tians have impos'd a Thou&s;and Cony-catching-Tricks, and Cheats upon 'em. But though you may deceive 'em once or twice, yet when their Eyes are op'n, they &s;trike home, and pay ye once for all. And tho&s;e &s;ort of Impo&s;itions which they lay upon Offenders in that Nature, are call'd <HI>Avanies;</HI> which are not always unju&s;t Impo&s;itions neither; they being like the Confi&s;cations &s;o frequent in Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;es: Where for the mo&s;t part the Chief Mini&s;ters and their Officers devour the People, while the <HI>Port</HI> winks at all the fir&s;t time, and only exhorts to Amendment. If the Complaints cea&s;e, the Offence is &s;tifl'd; but if the Clamour grow too loud, the <HI>Port</HI> &s;ends to take off the Head of the Party accus'd, and Confi&s;cates his E&s;tate. By which means the People are &s;atisfi'd, the Trea|&s;ury

is fill'd, Ju&s;tice is done, and the Example remains to ter|rifie others.</P>
<P>The Merchants of <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> affirm, That the Impo&s;ition of the&s;e Fines was the main thing that &s;poil'd the Trade of the <HI>French</HI> in the <HI>Levant,</HI> as having co&s;t 'em &s;uch prodigious Sums. But of all the Impo&s;itions that ever I heard of, there is one which I &s;hall never forget, that was laid upon the <HI>French</HI> Mer|chants, at the time that <HI>M. de S&eacute;&s;y</HI> was the Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>France</HI> at the <HI>Port,</HI> which happen'd thus.</P>
<P>His Excellency had a great de&s;ire to turn one of the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s Farmers, and to Farm the Cu&s;toms of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> and <HI>Smyrna.</HI> But at the end of Six Months, <HI>M. de S&eacute;&s;y</HI> find|ing him&s;elf a Hundred Thou&s;and <HI>Franks</HI> in Arrear reque&s;ted to be di&s;charg'd: which was a favour granted him on con|dition he would pay what he ow'd. But in regard he wanted Money, the <HI>Turks</HI> oblig'd the <HI>French</HI> Nation to pay for him. Thereupon he told the Merchants, That he had not tak'n upon him to Farm the Cu&s;toms, but in hopes to advance the Trade of the <HI>French,</HI> and to prevent the Squabbles and Diffe|rences which daily aro&s;e between the <HI>Turks</HI> and Them about the payment of their Duties. To which the Merchants fail'd not to make a fair Apology, and to ju&s;tifie them&s;elves by &s;o|lid Rea&s;on: but all to no purpo&s;e: there was no more to be done, but they mu&s;t pay down the Hunderd Thou&s;and <HI>Franks;</HI> &s;o that for want of Money of their own, they were reduc'd to that Exigency, as to borrow the Sum of the <HI>Jews</HI> at Five and Twenty <HI>per Cent.</HI> for Six Months. And I am certainly a&s;&s;ur'd by per&s;ons that were well acquainted with all the pa&s;&s;a|ges, that it was &s;o long before the Hunderd Thou&s;and <HI>Franks</HI> were paid, that the Intere&s;t amounted to three times as much as the Principal; &s;o that this <HI>Avanie,</HI> or Impo&s;ition co&s;t the <HI>French</HI> Nation near an Hunderd and Fifty Thou&s;and Crowns.</P>

The <HI>Venetians</HI> maintain a <HI>Con&s;ul</HI> at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> as al&s;o the <HI>Ge|noe&s;es;</HI> yet there are few Merchants, Natives in either of tho&s;e two Republicks, that live there; e&s;pecially of the <HI>Genoe&s;es,</HI> who have little or nothing to do in the <HI>Levant.</HI> They were only &s;etl'd there at fir&s;t by rea&s;on of the great Trade which they drove in <HI>Five-Sous-Pieces,</HI> in regard of the great profit which they gain'd.

<P>In the fir&s;t place therefore give me leave to ob&s;erve, That the <HI>Genoe&s;es</HI> were formerly very powerful in the <HI>Levant,</HI> as being the Lords and Ma&s;ters of &s;everal I&s;lands in the <HI>Archi|pelago,</HI> of &s;everal Places upon the Coa&s;t of the <HI>Grecian,</HI> and &s;everal Cities upon the <HI>Black-Sea. Pera</HI> al&s;o, now the Su|burbs of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> was under their Juri&s;diction. Upon which there is no need for me to dilate, in regard the Stories of pa&s;t Ages have giv'n a &s;ufficient Account, how and at what time they lo&s;t all this fair Extent of Dominion. But the War in <HI>Candy,</HI> which happen'd in the Year 1645. encou|rag'd 'em to revive their Commerce in the Territories of the <HI>Grand Signior;</HI> imagining they &s;hould make them&s;elves Ma|&s;ters of that Trade which the <HI>Venetians</HI> drove there before the War. And to the end they might bring about this De&s;ign with more &s;peed and &s;ecurity, they apply'd them&s;elves to the King of <HI>France</HI> for his Recommendation, as being the mo&s;t Antient, and mo&s;t Con&s;iderable Allie of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire. Which was ea&s;ily conde&s;cended to by the King's Council, who had Affairs in their Heads of greater Importance then Trade.
<PB N="12" REF="16">
In &s;o much that they did not fore&s;ee the great Dammages which it would bring upon the French Nation; of which the mo&s;t con&s;iderable was the prejudice done to the Articles of the Treaty between the Crown of <HI>France</HI> and the <HI>Port,</HI> being a kind of Annihilation of one of the Principal Capitulations, wherein it was concluded, <HI>That all European Nations, that &s;hould de&s;ire to &s;ettle in the</HI> Levant, <HI>&s;hould not be permitted to Trade, but under the Banners and Protection of</HI> France. How|ever the <HI>Genoe&s;es</HI> being thus recommended by the King, <HI>M. de la Haye,</HI> the Father, then the French Emba&s;&s;ador in <HI>Turkie,</HI> us'd the utmo&s;t of his endeavours to a&s;&s;i&s;t 'em. Neverthele&s;s it came to nothing, becau&s;e, as they &s;ay, it was not pro&s;ecu|ted with that vigor as it ought to have been.</P>
<P>In the Year 1664. they were very fierce upon it again, en|courag'd by the great Profit which was got by Pieces of <HI>Five-Sous.</HI> But they could not then expect that the French &s;hould &s;ollicite in their behalf as they had done before, becau&s;e the Face of Affairs was alter'd, as well in re&s;pect of Traffick in General, as of the <HI>Levant</HI> Trade in particular; rather they &s;aw that their Enterprize would be di&s;plea&s;ing to <HI>France:</HI> How|ever they believ'd, that the King of <HI>France</HI> had &s;o embroil'd him&s;elf with the <HI>Turk,</HI> by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance which he had giv'n the <HI>Venetians</HI> and the <HI>Emperor,</HI> that they did not think his Op|po&s;ition or his Recommendation would &s;tand 'em in any &s;tead. Thereupon they &s;ought the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>England</HI> and the Em|pire, and as for <HI>France,</HI> they &s;atisfi'd them&s;elves with giving the King a bare Information of their de&s;ign. Their Re&s;ident inform'd the King that there was a <HI>Levant Company</HI> &s;etting up at <HI>Genoa,</HI> and that the <HI>Republick</HI> had a de&s;ign to &s;end an Am|ba&s;&s;ador to the <HI>Port,</HI> in hopes that his Maje&s;ty would favour their Negotiation. But the King &s;aid no more, then only that he wi&s;h'd the <HI>Republick</HI> all good &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Which An&s;wer increa&s;ing the Su&s;picions that the <HI>Genoe&s;es</HI> had already conceiv'd, and putting 'em into a deep doubt what Re|ception they &s;hould meet with at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> they &s;ent <HI>Incog|nito</HI> the <HI>Marqui&s;s</HI> of <HI>Durazzo,</HI> as a Per&s;on that had the chiefe&s;t Intere&s;t in the Company, to &s;ift out the Truth, and to treat privately with the <HI>Vizier;</HI> to which purpo&s;e he went with Count <HI>Le&s;ley,</HI> the Emperors Extraordinary Amba&s;&s;ador, as one of his Train. In &s;hort, he &s;aw the <HI>Vizier,</HI> and treated with him, and by the Mediation of the &s;aid Amba&s;&s;ador, and the Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>England,</HI> who were very active in forward|ing the Negotiation, obtain'd that the <HI>Genoe&s;es</HI> &s;hould have the
<PB N="13" REF="16">
&s;ame Articles with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Hollanders.</HI> Upon which, the Envoy, having the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI>'s word in the Name of his Highne&s;s, return'd to <HI>Genoa,</HI> and gave an Account of his Ne|gotiation with the <HI>Divan.</HI> Pre&s;ently thereupon the <HI>Genoe&s;es</HI> fitted out two Ships, and &s;ent the &s;ame <HI>Marqui&s;s</HI> of <HI>Durazzo</HI> again in Quality of an Amba&s;&s;ador.</P>
<P>However the fir&s;t Conferences which the <HI>Marqui&s;s</HI> had with the <HI>Vizier</HI> were not &s;o &s;ecretly carried, but that the <HI>French</HI> in the <HI>Levant</HI> had private Intelligence of the <HI>Marqui&s;s</HI>'s Proceed|ings. Immediately they were much troubl'd at this De&s;ign of the <HI>Genoe&s;es,</HI> fearing it would be a great prejudice to their Trade; which was the rea&s;on that they wrote into <HI>France,</HI> that their Trade would be much impair'd, if the <HI>Genoe&s;es</HI> came to be &s;etl'd in <HI>Turkie;</HI> and therefore that all means were to be us'd to prevent 'em. Which Addre&s;s procur'd a Re&s;olution to hinder 'em, and In&s;tructions to that purpo&s;e were &s;ent to the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador at the <HI>Port,</HI> who was then <HI>M. de la Haye,</HI> the Son.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner therefore was he come back from <HI>Adrianople,</HI> where he had been about other Affairs, but he receiv'd Orders to op|po&s;e the E&s;tabli&s;hment of the <HI>Genoe&s;es.</HI> Which made him &s;end back immediately for leave to return. For in <HI>Turkie</HI> no Amba&s;&s;ador mu&s;t appear at Court without Permi&s;&s;ion. But it happen'd that the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> was not then in Town, be|ing gone toward <HI>The&s;&s;aly,</HI> to ha&s;ten the Siege of <HI>Candy.</HI> And as for the <HI>Caimacan,</HI> who is as it were his <HI>Deputy,</HI> He, having private Intelligence of the new In&s;tructions which the Am|ba&s;&s;ador had receiv'd from <HI>France,</HI> made an&s;wer, That he could not grant the Amba&s;&s;ador leave, without the <HI>Grand Vi|zier</HI>'s con&s;ent.</P>
<P>This the Amba&s;&s;ador look'd upon as a flat Refu&s;al; and therefore &s;ent a Gentleman to <HI>Adrianople</HI> with In&s;tructions, to repre&s;ent to the <HI>Chief Mini&s;ters,</HI> That by the Capitulations be|tween the <HI>Emperor</HI> of <HI>France</HI> and the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> the <HI>Port</HI> was oblig'd not to entertain any <HI>European</HI> Nation, new Comers, but under the Colours of <HI>France;</HI> and &s;o it was contrary to the Capitulations to Treat with the <HI>Genoe&s;es;</HI> for which rea|&s;on if they did proceed to a Conclu&s;ion of the Treaty, He would be gone. Which Me&s;&s;age, together with &s;o much of his In&s;tructions as he thought requi&s;ite, were &s;ent to the <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> and debated in the place where he lay. But the An|&s;wer which the <HI>Vizier</HI> return'd, was very har&s;h and unci|vil. Which was not to be wonder'd at in regard the <HI>Vizier</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="17">
was at that time highly incens'd for the Affairsfront which he had receiv'd in <HI>Hungary,</HI> by means of the <HI>French.</HI> His Reply therefore was, <Q>That the <HI>Port</HI> was open for him as well to go, as to come: That the Emperor of <HI>France</HI> had nothing to do to hinder the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> from making a Peace with his Antient Enemies, or to grant 'em their Capitulations when they came to demand 'em: and that it might &s;uffice his Ma|je&s;ty to be acknowledg'd at the <HI>Port</HI> under the Titles of Em|peror and Chief Monarch of <HI>Chri&s;t'ndom,</HI> without taking up|on him to pre&s;cribe to others what they were to do.</Q></P>
<P>The Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>Genoa</HI> arriv'd at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> at the &s;ame time that the&s;e Endeavours were us'd to prevent his Recepti|on. Which was to him however no &s;urprize, in regard he had already had Intelligence while he was at Sea, that &s;ome &s;uch thing was in Agitation. Be&s;ides, he had Advice, that the <HI>Re&s;ident</HI> of <HI>Genoa</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> having made known to the King, that his Ma&s;ters had &s;ent the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Durazzo</HI> in the Quality of an Amba&s;&s;ador to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> the King &s;hould return this An&s;wer; <HI>I wi&s;h the Amba&s;&s;ador of the Republick a good Voyage, but I know not what our Own has done at the Port upon this Occa&s;ion.</HI> I have &s;een &s;everal People who were of Opinion, that if the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> had not had a particular Peek again&s;t the <HI>French,</HI> and &s;ome kind of aver&s;ion to the Amba&s;&s;ador's Per|&s;on, that the <HI>Genoe&s;es</HI> had not been receiv'd into the <HI>Levant.</HI> For that the <HI>Port</HI> had no &s;uch high value for an Intere&s;t of Trade, to grant a favour to the prejudice of <HI>France,</HI> from which their Hands were &s;o &s;peciou&s;ly ty'd with a fair pretence.</P>
<P>After I had &s;taid twelve days at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> I embark'd for <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> where I arriv'd the Ninth of <HI>March,</HI> and Landed without any trouble, any danger, or any expence a very great Quantity of Rich Goods, which I brought along with me, be|ing more then two Hor&s;es could carry. For <HI>M. de Nointel</HI> did me that favour as to give me leave to put his Name and the <HI>Flowre de Lices</HI> upon my Che&s;ts, and then &s;ent for 'em as be|longing to him&s;elf. Which was done with the greate&s;t ea&s;e in the World. For he pre&s;ently &s;ent his Interpreter to the Officer of the <HI>Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e,</HI> to let him know that he had two Che&s;ts aboard a <HI>Flemi&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;el that arriv'd the day before, which belong'd to him; and therefore de&s;ir'd they might be deliver'd Cu&s;tom-free. Accordingly the Officer gave &s;uch Order, that the Interpreter went aboard the Dutch Ve&s;&s;el, un|laded the two Che&s;ts, and &s;ent 'em to the Amba&s;&s;ador's Hou&s;e,
<PB N="15" REF="17">
who did me Kindne&s;&s;es to &s;end 'em to my Lodging the next day.</P>
<P>For all Amba&s;&s;adors, Re&s;idents, and Envoys that re&s;ide at the <HI>Port,</HI> have the Priviledge to Import and Export whatever they plea&s;e; provided they undertake to own the Goods as belonging to them&s;elves; nor does the Officer of the Cu&s;toms dare to take any Cogni&s;ance of it. Which is a Civility and Genero&s;ity of the <HI>Turks</HI> not to be parallell'd in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>When I arriv'd at <HI>Con&s;tantinople, M. de Nointel</HI> was prepa|ring to attend the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> in order to the Renovation of the Articles. It was an Affair of great Impor|tance, and which had made a great Noi&s;e in the World, as having hung in &s;u&s;pence for Seven Years together, and for that the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;till &s;tood upon their Terms and haughtily &s;lighted the Amba&s;&s;ador notwith&s;tanding that they were then entring into a doubtfull War again&s;t <HI>Poland.</HI> And now I &s;hall give ye an accompt of the Original of the Differences that were at that time grown to a great Height between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Turkie.</HI></P>
<P>At the beginning of the Raign of <HI>Mahomet</HI> the IV. the pre|&s;ent Emperor of the <HI>Turks,</HI> who a&s;cended the Imperial Throne at Seven Years of Age, in the Year 1648. the Government was &s;olely in the Hands of Women and Eunuchs, who fill'd all the Chief Places of Honour and Tru&s;t with &s;uch Per&s;ons as they pleas'd them&s;elves. And the <HI>Turks</HI> acknowledge, that the <HI>Ottoman Court</HI> was never &s;o corrupt, nor in &s;uch a &s;trange Confu&s;ion as at that Time. You &s;hould &s;ee almo&s;t every Month a new <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> who after he had been &s;ome few days in his Office, was not only di&s;charg'd from his High Im|ployment, but many times depriv'd of his Life. Now it is the Cu&s;tom in <HI>Turkie,</HI> that upon the Advancement of any <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> all Per&s;ons of Quality go to ki&s;s his Hands, and carry him &s;ome con&s;iderable Pre&s;ent. More particularly all Amba&s;|&s;adors are oblig'd to that Ceremony. But <HI>M. de la Haye</HI> the Father, then Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>France</HI> at the <HI>Port,</HI> ob&s;erving the frequent Changes of <HI>Grand Viziers</HI> at that time concluded that there would be no Reformation of this evil Management during the Emperor's Minority, and that all his Vi&s;its and Pre&s;ents to the <HI>New Vizier,</HI> were but &s;o many Vi&s;its and Pre|&s;ents lo&s;t. So that he re&s;olv'd to &s;it &s;till Quietly, and to &s;pare his Compliments and the charge of his Pre&s;ents.</P>
<P>It happen'd in a &s;hort while after, that <HI>Cuperly Mahomet Pacha,</HI> receiv'd the Seals of the Empire, that is to &s;ay, was
<PB N="16" REF="18">
advanc'd to the High Dignity of <HI>Prime Vizier.</HI> But the Am|ba&s;&s;ador &s;till believ'd that his Fortune would be no better then that of his Predece&s;&s;ors, and that he had but a very &s;hort Raign; but he was deciev'd; for it &s;o fell out, that this <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> upheld him&s;elf in his Office, till his Death, which hap|pen'd in the Year 1662.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as he was advanc'd, every one pay'd him their Vi&s;its, and made him their accu&s;tom'd Pre&s;ents, and among the Re&s;t all the Forraign Mini&s;ters, except the French Amba&s;&s;ador. To which as they &s;ay, he was adviz'd and &s;everal times mo&s;t earne&s;tly pre&s;s'd; but his good Husbandry for the Nation was &s;uch, that he would not be over-rul'd. However at length percieving that <HI>Cuperly</HI> fix'd him&s;elf at Court upon the Ruine of &s;everal of the Grandees, and that according to all outward Appearances he was like to continue <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> at length he made him both his Vi&s;it and his Pre&s;ents.</P>
<P>But then the <HI>Vizier,</HI> hainou&s;ly offended at his Remi&s;&s;ne&s;s, and the little value he had te&s;tifi'd for his Per&s;on before, had laid a de&s;ign to be reveng'd not only upon him, but upon all the <HI>French</HI> Nation. And this in truth was the Source and Ori|ginal of that Mi&s;under&s;tanding between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Turkie,</HI> as well during that whole time the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> liv'd, which was Twelve Years, as al&s;o during the Prime Mini&s;try of his Son that &s;ucceeded him. So that the &s;everity of the <HI>Port</HI> toward the Three la&s;t Amba&s;&s;adors of <HI>France, M. de la Haye,</HI> the Fa|ther, <HI>M. de la Haye,</HI> the Son, and <HI>Mon&s;ieur Nointel,</HI> and the &s;everal Impo&s;itions that were laid upon the <HI>French,</HI> for Twen|ty Years together, are to be Originally attributed to a particular and Per&s;onal Enmity, notwith&s;tanding all the Rea&s;ons after|wards pretended, of which the Principal and ju&s;te&s;t were the Enterprize of <HI>Gigery,</HI> and the Succors giv'n to the <HI>Emperor</HI> and the <HI>Venetians.</HI></P>
<P>Nor was the <HI>Vizier</HI> long before he found an Opportunity to Thunder forth his Re&s;entments. Such a one, as he could not have wi&s;h'd for a better to advance his mi&s;chievous De&s;ign. For then was the War very hot in <HI>Candy,</HI> and <HI>France</HI> had &s;e|cretly a&s;&s;i&s;ted the <HI>Venetians</HI> at the beginning of the War. Nay more, it is &s;aid, that <HI>M. de la Haye</HI> had In&s;tructions to hold a private Corre&s;pondence with the <HI>Venetians,</HI> and to give 'em In|telligence of the Turki&s;h De&s;igns. Now it happen'd in the Year 1659. that a French-Man, who went by the Name of <HI>Verta|mont,</HI> and who had a very con&s;iderable Imployment in the <HI>Ve|netian</HI> Army, de&s;ir'd leave of the <HI>Captain General,</HI> to go and
<PB N="17" REF="18">
&s;ee <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> Pre&s;ently the <HI>General</HI> gave him a Pa&s;s, and charg'd him with a great Packet of Letters for the <HI>French</HI> Am|ba&s;&s;ador. But the <HI>French</HI> Man, who had no other de&s;ign then to turn <HI>Turk,</HI> apply'd him&s;elf to the <HI>Caimacan</HI> of <HI>Con|&s;tantinople,</HI> and told him, That he had quitted the Camp of the Chri&s;tians, as being re&s;olv'd to adjure their Religion, and embrace <HI>Mahumati&s;m;</HI> and more, that he had a Packet of great Importance to deliver into the Hands of the <HI>Grand Vizier.</HI> Upon which the <HI>Caimacan</HI> order'd him forthwith to be con|vey'd to <HI>Adrianople,</HI> where the Court then lay. Nor was this perfidious <HI>Renegade,</HI> contented only to renounce his Faith, but di&s;cover'd to the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> the &s;ecret Corre&s;pondence be|tween the Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>France</HI> and the <HI>Venetians;</HI> and far|ther told him, That the Packet of Letters which he had deli|ver'd into his Hands would convince him clearly of the Truth of what he &s;aid.</P>
<P>The <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> had a jealou&s;ie of this &s;ecret Corre&s;pon|dence before, but being now in a manner a&s;&s;ur'd in his &s;u&s;pi|tions through the Di&s;coveries of the <HI>Renegade,</HI> it may be rea|dily conjectur'd to what a degree his pa&s;&s;ion tran&s;ported him again&s;t the Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>France,</HI> incens'd as he was already, and boyling with revenge, e&s;pecially being naturally inhuman and bloody. However at this time he put a curb upon him|&s;elf, and &s;hew'd more re&s;erv'dne&s;s and moderation then could be expected from him.</P>
<P><HI>M. de la Haye,</HI> who well under&s;tood <HI>Vertamont</HI>'s De&s;ign, and what his Errand was to the Court, and be&s;ides was well acquainted with the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI>'s Di&s;po&s;ition, his Implaca|bility, and the Importance of the Affair, made no que&s;tion but the Intercepted Packet would put him to a great deal of trouble; and therefore he con&s;ulted with his Interpreters and his Secretaries. Immediately the Secretary for his Ciphers took &s;uch a fright at the Unfortunate Accident, that he re|&s;olv'd to march off, well knowing that the <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> up|on the like occa&s;ion of a Letter in Ciphers Intercepted, had caus'd an Interpreter to the <HI>Venetians</HI> to be Drubb'd to Death. Thereupon, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to <HI>M. de la Haye, Sir,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>I am naturally &s;o very timorous, that &s;o &s;oon as I feel the Drub|bing-Stick, there is no &s;ecret which I &s;hall not reveal; and there|fore &s;ecure me, or let me make my e&s;cape.</HI> Upon which the Am|ba&s;&s;ador order'd him to be conveigh'd into a private Conceal|ment, and prepar'd to abide the Shock, whatever happen'd. He then kept his Bed, very ill of the Stone, &s;o that he could
<PB N="18" REF="19">
not go to <HI>Adrianople,</HI> though he had receiv'd Orders to appear there. However he &s;ent a Me&s;&s;age to the <HI>Caimacan</HI> who &s;ent him the Order, to tell him, That he was &s;ick a Bed, &s;o that it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to Travel; neverthele&s;s he would &s;end his Son in his &s;tead.</P>
<P>But &s;o it happen'd, that all the Letters which the <HI>Grand Vi|zier</HI> met with in the <HI>Venetian</HI> General's Packet, were writ in Ciphers; &s;o that all the Renegado's and Interpreters in the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Court were &s;ent for in vain; for there was not one that had a Key to the Lock: which enrag'd the <HI>Vizier</HI> &s;o much the more. And as for <HI>M. de la Haye</HI> the Son, he found him in &s;uch an ill Humour, at his coming to <HI>Adrianople,</HI> that up|on his returning him an An&s;wer, &s;omewhat more boldly perhaps then the Circum&s;tance would bear, <HI>Cuperly</HI> trans&s;port|ed with pa&s;&s;ion, not only caus'd him to be abus'd in his Per&s;on, but &s;ent him Pri&s;oner to a Tower adjoyning to the Wall of the City; &s;aying withal, <HI>That he was not to endure that from an Amba&s;&s;ador's Deputy, though his Son, which he might bear with in the Amba&s;&s;ador him&s;elf.</HI> However, the <HI>Vizier</HI> did no harm either to the Merchants or the Interpreters, that went along with <HI>M. de la Haye:</HI> nor to the Secretary or Chancellor; be|ing all di&s;charg'd at the expence of that fear, into which he had put 'em at fir&s;t, by Threats and cruel Menaces of Tor|ment and Death if they did not Decipher the General's Let|ters. Only one of the Interpreters fell into &s;uch a Di&s;temper upon it, that he has continu'd &s;ick every &s;ince, and 'tis thought he will never recover.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ottoman</HI> Court was then at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> as I have &s;aid, making great Preparations for the <HI>Tran&s;ylvanian</HI> War. So that <HI>M. de la Haye</HI> the Father, under&s;tanding the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> was ready to march, and fearing his departure before he had en|larg'd his Son, as it really fell out, &s;trove with his Di&s;temper, and took a Journey to <HI>Adrianople;</HI> to which his Daughter-in-Law per&s;waded him, urging him continually, That if he did not &s;peedily labour the Di&s;charge of his Son, he might be in danger of his Life; and that the <HI>Vizier</HI> was cruel and incens'd; and therefore he ought to u&s;e his utmo&s;t Endeavours to pacific his Fury.</P>
<P>A Month after the <HI>Vizier</HI>'s departure, the Amba&s;&s;ador ven|tur'd upon a bold Exploit, that de&s;erves to be remember'd.</P>
<P>A little before <HI>Vertamont</HI>'s coming to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> there arriv'd in the &s;ame place a certain <HI>French</HI> Man, who&s;e Name was <HI>Quiclet,</HI> together with his Wife, and another <HI>French</HI> Man
<PB N="19" REF="19">
who&s;e Name was <HI>Poulet,</HI> &s;o enamour'd of <HI>Quiclet</HI>'s Wife, that he never for&s;ook her in all her Rambles. This <HI>Quiclet</HI> was a great Interpreter of Ciphers, a Man of Learning, but of lit|tle Judgment. He had al&s;o been employ'd to Decipher Cha|racters by &s;everal Mini&s;ters of State, and divers Amba&s;&s;adors. But he was &s;o much a Beggar, that he could not well be poorer then he was; nor do I know what unlucky Star brought him to <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> It is reported however, that he having heard of the great Rewards which the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> promis'd to any one that could Uncipher the <HI>Captain General</HI>'s Letters, the Wife of this wretched Fellow addre&s;&s;ing her &s;elf to &s;ome Gentlemen that belong'd to <HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Haye,</HI> gave it out, <HI>That though his Excellency refus'd to lend her Husband Money, yet if he would him&s;elf, he could have what he pleas'd of the Grand Vizier.</HI> I am not certain whether it were really &s;o, as the Thing was related to me: but however it were, <HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Haye,</HI> who well knew the great de&s;ire which <HI>Cuperly</HI> had to under&s;tand what was contain'd in the Intercepted Letters, and fearing le&s;t they &s;hould reveal &s;ome Things as well to his own, as to the Ruine of all the <HI>French</HI> in the <HI>Levant,</HI> he &s;ent for the Fellow, carry'd him up to the Terrace of his Palace that lookt into the Garden; and after he had walk'd two or three Turns, holding him in a di&s;cour&s;e, which what it was, no body knows, he gave a &s;ign to &s;ome per&s;ons plac'd there for the purpo&s;e, who threw him headlong over the Battlements, at what time another Gang, po&s;ted near the place where he fell, perceiving he was not dead with the Fall, fini&s;h'd the Work, and buri'd him privately.</P>
<P>After this, the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador having Audience of the <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> he &s;ent for the Intercepted Letters, and de&s;ir'd the Amba&s;&s;ador to explain 'em. To which <HI>Mon&s;ieur le Haye</HI> made An&s;wer, That it was well known to all the World, that the Amba&s;&s;adors and Mini&s;ters of the <HI>Chri&s;tian Princes,</HI> never wrote one to another unle&s;s it were in Characters, whatever the Subject were; neverthele&s;s they did not under&s;tand the Characters them&s;elves; as having their Secretaries who com|pos'd and writ the Ciphers, and then explain'd them when they had done: That as for the Per&s;on by him employ'd for that purpo&s;e, he had &s;ent him back into <HI>France,</HI> about &s;ix Months ago. Yet if the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> would permit him to carry the Letters home, he would try to Uncipher 'em, and if it could be done, he would be &s;ure to let him know the Contents. But the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> having heard this An&s;wer, only &s;mil'd
<PB N="20" REF="20">
upon the Amba&s;&s;ador, and &s;o pre&s;ently ro&s;e from his Seat, without &s;peaking &s;o much as one word. Some few days after the Chief Mini&s;ter departed for <HI>Tran&s;ylvania,</HI> leaving <HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Haye,</HI> the Son, in Pri&s;on, but not &s;o clo&s;ely re&s;train'd as before, and <HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Haye,</HI> the Father, without any manner of An&s;wer.</P>
<P>The <HI>Grand Signior</HI> did not go in Per&s;on to the <HI>Tran&s;ylvanian</HI> War, but remain'd at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> where the Amba&s;&s;ador al&s;o tarry'd, in hopes to obtain of his Highne&s;s his Son's Enlarge|ment; but no body dur&s;t open their Mouths to the Emperor without the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI>'s order. Who having put a quick end to the <HI>Tran&s;ylvanian</HI> Di&s;order return'd Victorious to <HI>Con|&s;tantinople.</HI> Where &s;o &s;oon as he arriv'd, he was put in mind of both the <HI>Mon&s;ieurs de la Haye.</HI> At which the <HI>Vizier,</HI> faigning a kind of &s;urpri&s;e, <HI>And what,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>Are tho&s;e Gentlemen &s;till here?</HI> Which was as much as to &s;ay, <HI>They might go where they Pleas'd;</HI> as it appear'd by the di&s;charge of the Son, which was order'd forthwith: And &s;o both the one and the other re|turn'd to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> without &s;o much as &s;eeing the <HI>Vizier</HI>'s Face.</P>
<P>When it was known in <HI>France</HI> how unkindly the <HI>Grand Vi|zier</HI> has us'd <HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Haye,</HI> the Cardinal di&s;patch'd a Gentleman to the Prime Mini&s;ter, to prevent the ill Con&s;e|quences of &s;uch Proceedings. <HI>Cuperly,</HI> who&s;e Malice augmen|ted through de&s;ire of revenge, as one that mortally hated the two <HI>Mon&s;ieurs de la Haye,</HI> would fain have &s;ent them back, and oblig'd the Gentleman to have tak'n upon him the Title of Amba&s;&s;ador in their Room, engaging to interpo&s;e &s;o effectually, that the Alteration &s;hould be approv'd in <HI>France.</HI> But the Gentleman would not hear of that Propo&s;ition by any means, excu&s;ing him&s;elf fairly and genteelly. And it is moreover re|ported that he highly pleas'd the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI>'s Humor in all their Tran&s;acting together. I am &s;orry I know not his Name, which would have been an Honour to this Relation.</P>
<P>The Accompt which the Gentleman gave of his Negotia|tion, caus'd <HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Haye</HI> to be recall'd. However there was not any one &s;ent to &s;ucceed him; only he had orders to leave in his Place, as Re&s;ident, a French Merchant, that had liv'd for &s;everal Years in <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> who&s;e Name was <HI>Mon|&s;ieur Rokely.</HI> Nor had <HI>France</HI> any other Mini&s;ter in tho&s;e parts till the end of the Year 1665.</P>
<P>The King, who had then tak'n the Government into his own Hands, and Rul'd with no le&s;s Renown then Succe&s;s,
<PB N="21" REF="20">
had already &s;ufficiently reveng'd him&s;elf for the Affronts offer'd to the Family of his Amba&s;&s;ador, and for the heavy Fines and Impo&s;itions laid upon his Subjects in <HI>Turkie,</HI> by lending pow|erful Succours to the Enemies of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire. All which did but heighten the bad Under&s;tanding which was be|tween the Two Empires, and Things were arriv'd to that Point, that there mu&s;t either be an ab&s;olute Breach, or a New Alliance. The Importance of the <HI>Levant</HI> Trade advis'd the latter; &s;o that the King re&s;olv'd to &s;end an Amba&s;&s;ador to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> to renew the Articles of Peace. <HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Haye</HI> was then at <HI>Paris,</HI> &s;olliciting for Imployment, and &s;eve|ral Arrears due to him as Heir to his Father, who had been dead in that City &s;ome years before. Now in regard he under&s;tood better then any other Per&s;on, the Gains and Advantages of a <HI>Con&s;tantinopolitan</HI> Emba&s;&s;ie, together with the Splendor and Authority that belongs to it, he made great Friends for the Place; and to remove all Oppo&s;ition and Ob&s;tructions in his way, he offer'd to quit all his Arrears to the Chief Mi|ni&s;ter.</P>
<P>Thereupon, his Friends at Court alledg'd His great Expe|rience in the Affairs of <HI>Turkie;</HI> and that his Courage and Re|&s;olution was &s;uch as was requi&s;ite for an Emba&s;&s;ie to the <HI>Otto|man Port.</HI> On the other &s;ide, that it was for the King's Ho|nour to &s;end him thither, were it only to humble the <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> who mu&s;t now be con&s;train'd to honour that very Per|&s;on, whom his Father had abus'd and hated; Meaning <HI>Cuperly Mahamed Pacha,</HI> who dy'd in the Year 1662. after he had &s;etl'd his Son in his Room. Nor can I tell how this Coun&s;el, as bad as it was, came to be embrac'd, unle&s;s it were in pro&s;e|cution of that De&s;ign which the Court always had to bring the <HI>Turks</HI> to a Compliance by force. The Event of Affairs will &s;hew that there was &s;omething of that Nature in the Ma|nagement of this Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Haye</HI> arriv'd at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> in the Month of <HI>November</HI> 1665. He al&s;o made a Magnificent Entry, and behav'd him&s;elf for five Years together that he continu'd Am|ba&s;&s;ador, with as much State as could be expected from a Re|&s;olute Mini&s;ter, and one that bore the Character of an Am|ba&s;&s;ador from a Potent and Formidable Prince. He di&s;cours'd of nothing in the Vi&s;its that he made to the Mini&s;ters of the <HI>Divan</HI> but of the Grandeur of the King his Ma&s;ter, and the Invincible Strength of his Armies. This offended the <HI>Vizier</HI> extreamly, who lookt upon it as an Affront done to him, and
<PB N="22" REF="21">
the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> even in his own Court; and this Fore&s;tall|ment of his Honour, caus'd him to treat the Amba&s;&s;ador with di&s;dain and contempt. So that when he gave him Audience, he receiv'd him with that pride and &s;corn which was un&s;uffe|rable, not vouch&s;afing &s;o much as to look upon him, or to ri&s;e from his Seat according to the ancient Cu&s;tom, and the u&s;ual practice at the Reception of Amba&s;&s;adors either from the Em|peror or any other Crowned Heads. And not content with that, he upbraided him in bitter Language, with the Succours which <HI>France</HI> had &s;ent into <HI>Hungary</HI> and <HI>Candy,</HI> and the Enter|pri&s;e of <HI>Gigery. Mon&s;ieur de la Haye</HI> di&s;&s;embl'd his Re&s;entment, believing that when he took his leave, the <HI>Vizier</HI> would &s;hew him more Civility: but he was deceiv'd; for the <HI>Vizier</HI> di&s;|mi&s;s'd him with the &s;ame Indifferency, wherewith he had re|ceiv'd him.</P>
<P>The Amba&s;&s;ador reflecting upon the Affront, which the <HI>Vi|zier</HI> had done him at that Audience, &s;ent to him to demand another, upon Condition that he &s;hould receive him &s;tanding, and forbear any farther Reproaches. The <HI>Rai&s;quitab,</HI> who is the High-Chancellor of the Empire, and the <HI>Vizier</HI>'s <HI>Kiaia,</HI> or Chief Controller of his Hou&s;hold, an&s;wer'd the Interpreter, That he might a&s;&s;ure his Ma&s;ter, the <HI>Vizier</HI> would receive him, as became him. Thereupon, the Amba&s;&s;ador relying upon a promi&s;e, that indeed carry'd with it a manife&s;t Equivo|cation, went to his Audience, but his Reception was nothing different from what it was before. Which di&s;gu&s;ted <HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Haye</HI> to that degree, that he told the <HI>Vizier,</HI> That the Emperor of <HI>France</HI> having &s;ent him to the <HI>Port,</HI> to Confirm the League of Amity between the two Princes, he would not take the Audience which he had giv'n him for an Audience, becau&s;e he had not paid him tho&s;e Honours which were due to the Amba&s;&s;ador of the Greate&s;t and mo&s;t Potent Monarch in <HI>Chri&s;tendom.</HI> Moreover he declar'd, That he had Order to give him up the Articles of Peace, and return into <HI>France</HI> in the &s;ame Ve&s;&s;el that had brought him, if he did not treat him an|&s;werably to the Grandeur of his Ma&s;ter. Which &s;o incens'd the <HI>Vizier,</HI> that he fell into a pa&s;&s;ion, and vented his Choler in reviling and reproachful terms. On the other &s;ide, the Amba&s;&s;ador was &s;o highly provok'd, that &s;natching the Arti|cles of Peace out of the Interpreters Hands, he threw 'em at the Knees of the Haughty Mini&s;ter, and ri&s;ing from his Seat, flung out of the Room without &s;peaking a word, or vouch|&s;afing to tarry for an An&s;wer. But he was &s;topp'd at the Door
<PB N="23" REF="21">
of the Anti-Chamber; at what time the <HI>Vizier</HI> &s;ent for the <HI>Mufti, Vani Effendi</HI> the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s Tutor, and the Cap|tain <HI>Ba&s;ha,</HI> to deliberate what was to be done in an Accident of &s;uch Importance as this. The Re&s;ult was, That they &s;hould inform the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> who was then gone a Hunt|ing Twenty Leagues from <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> which was the Rea|&s;on that the An&s;wer was delay'd for three days, during all which time, <HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Haye</HI> lay under Confinement in an Apartment of the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s Palace.</P>
<P>In the mean while the Captain <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> brought a Me&s;&s;age in the <HI>Vizier</HI>'s Name, That if the Amba&s;&s;ador would Ki&s;s his Gar|ment, he would receive him as he had receiv'd Count <HI>Le&s;ley,</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador from his Imperial Maje&s;ty; that he would al&s;o re|ceive him &s;tanding, and pay him all tho&s;e Honours which he had paid to that Count. To which the Amba&s;&s;ador an&s;wer'd, That he was not to be govern'd by Pre&s;idents of any Per&s;on, when they were prejudicial to the Honour of the Emperor of <HI>France.</HI> The Captain <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> demanded what he could object again&s;t the Example of Count <HI>Le&s;ley, who&s;e Ma&s;ter was the Emperor of Seven Kings?</HI> a Title which the Emperor a&s;&s;umes among the <HI>Turks,</HI> as being Elected by Seven Electors. At length, after many Di&s;putes on both &s;ides, and that the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> had given his An&s;wer, it was concluded between the <HI>Vizier</HI> and the Amba&s;&s;ador, That he might return to his Lodg|ing when he pleas'd, that the two Audiences which he had receiv'd &s;hould &s;tand for nothing, and that he would grant him another with all the Cu&s;tomary Civilities and Cere|monies.</P>
<P>This Audience was giv'n him in the Month of <HI>January</HI> 1666. At what time, the <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> becau&s;e he would not be oblig'd to ri&s;e when the Amba&s;&s;ador was introduc'd, order'd him to be brought into a particular Room of State, whither he came to meet him. At his fir&s;t Entrance he demean'd him|&s;elf with an extraordinary Civility, approaching the Amba&s;|&s;ador with a &s;miling Countenance, and reaching forth his Hand. On the other &s;ide, <HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Haye,</HI> who was glad to &s;ee &s;uch a Compliance, an&s;wer'd his Civilities and Com|pliments with all &s;uitable Decency, as if he had never &s;een him before; and the Audience ended with all the Courte&s;ie and <HI>Decorum</HI> that could be expected on both &s;ides: The Am|ba&s;&s;ador and his Retinue being Treated with Perfumes, Coffee, Sorbet, and Four and Twenty Turki&s;h Ve&s;ts. The next Month he had Audience of his Highne&s;s, where every thing was ma|nag'd
<PB N="24" REF="22">
according to the u&s;ual Cu&s;tom, with all Civility; it not being proper to di&s;cour&s;e of Bu&s;ine&s;s to the <HI>Grand Sig|nior.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Haye</HI> had Orders to demand the renewing the former Articles of Peace, and Liberty of Trading to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> through the <HI>Red-Sea.</HI> But the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> would not con&s;ent either to the one or the other, upon the Conditi|ons that were propounded: and in <HI>March</HI> he left <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and attended the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> to <HI>Adrianople,</HI> from whence he departed for <HI>Candy.</HI> At the &s;ame time al&s;o <HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Haye</HI> follow'd the Court to <HI>Adrianople,</HI> where he had &s;everal Conferences with the <HI>Caimacan</HI> in reference to his Negotiation; but in regard that Mini&s;ter dur&s;t not conclude any thing with|out con&s;ulting the <HI>Vizier, Mon&s;ieur de la Haye</HI> return'd to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> having made no farther progre&s;s in his Bu|&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Soon after happen'd the Treaty of <HI>Genoa,</HI> already &s;pok'n of, which put the whole Affair into an ab&s;olute Confu&s;ion, and exa&s;perated both Parties. For on the one &s;ide, the <HI>Genoe&s;es</HI> were entertain'd notwith&s;tanding the Prote&s;tations and Threats of the Amba&s;&s;ador, and on the other &s;ide, the Amba&s;&s;ador, in his Complaints and Prote&s;ts, made u&s;e of Expre&s;&s;ions that offended the Turki&s;h Mini&s;ters. They had written to him, as I have already related, <HI>That it was not for the King his Ma&s;ter to oppo&s;e the Reception of any whoever they were, whom the</HI> Grand Signior <HI>was pleas'd to favour with his Friend&s;hip; and that it was &s;ufficient for his Ma&s;ter to be acknowledg'd at the</HI> Ottoman <HI>Court, for the fir&s;t Prince in</HI> Chri&s;tendom. To which <HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Haye</HI> made An&s;wer, <HI>That as for what concern'd his High Titles, the Emperor of</HI> France <HI>was only be|holding to God and his Victorious Arms.</HI> Which was tak'n very ill, as being the &s;ame Titles which the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> a&s;&s;umes to him&s;elf, and which the <HI>Turks</HI> believe to be only due to his Highne&s;s. And therefore the Mini&s;ters &s;ignifi'd to <HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Haye, That never any Amba&s;&s;ador had made u&s;e of tho&s;e Titles before; neither was it a Thing which had been ever al|low'd by the</HI> Divan, <HI>to any other Per&s;on what&s;oever.</HI> In the mean time the <HI>French</HI> &s;ent very con&s;iderable Succours to <HI>Can|dy,</HI> which much retarded the Conque&s;t of the I&s;land, while the <HI>Turks</HI> on the other &s;ide oppre&s;s'd the French Merchants with new Impo&s;itions and Extortions. In &s;o much that their Complaints, which grew louder and louder every day, oblig'd the King to &s;end expre&s;s Order to <HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Haye,</HI> to re|turn
<PB N="25" REF="22">
to <HI>France,</HI> and lay a&s;ide all thoughts of renewing the League, at lea&s;t if it were not a Thing fir&s;t &s;ought and de&s;ir'd by the Mini&s;ters of the <HI>Port.</HI> Which Orders were deliver'd to him toward the end of the Year 1668. not a little to his di&s;|&s;atisfaction. However he did not forbear to Vi&s;it the <HI>Caima|can</HI> at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> telling him that he had receiv'd Orders from the King his Ma&s;ter to return home; to which purpo&s;e he expected the Arrival of the Ve&s;&s;els which his Maje&s;ty had &s;ent, and his leave of the <HI>Port,</HI> in order to his Departure; re|que&s;ting him withal to write to the Court, that he might be &s;ent for withal Expedition.</P>
<P>The Court was then at <HI>Lari&s;&s;a</HI> in <HI>The&s;&s;aly,</HI> whither his High|ne&s;s was gone, to the end that being &s;omewhat the nearer to <HI>Candy,</HI> he might be a means to ha&s;ten the Conque&s;t. And therefore, before the <HI>Caimacan,</HI> who is as it were the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI>'s Lieutenant, would write, he demanded of <HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Haye,</HI> Whether any other Amba&s;&s;ador came in his Room? To which he an&s;wer'd, <HI>Not any;</HI> but that the Emperor his Ma&s;ter had commanded him to leave a <HI>Secretary</HI> or a <HI>French</HI> Merchant for his Re&s;ident, like the Repre&s;entatives of the <HI>Hol|landers</HI> and <HI>Genoe&s;es.</HI> The <HI>Caimacan</HI> ask'd him, Wherefore no Amba&s;&s;ador was &s;ent? To which the other reply'd, <HI>That it was not a Thing which he could declare in publick.</HI> By which An&s;wer the <HI>Caimacan</HI> apprehending that he had &s;omething of &s;ecre&s;ie to impart to him, gave him a private Audience. And then it was that the Amba&s;&s;ador di&s;cover'd to him, the rea&s;ons which oblig'd the Emperor of <HI>France</HI> to recal him, with a Re|&s;olution never to &s;end any more Amba&s;&s;adors to the <HI>Ottoman Port.</HI> Fir&s;t, for that the Dignity of the Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>France</HI> had not been regarded nor re&s;pected as it ought to be. That no heed had been given neither to the Complaints nor Reque&s;ts which his Maje&s;ty had made for three Years together. That they refus'd to renew the Capitulations of Peace, which was an un&s;ufferable Damage to the <HI>French</HI> Merchants, who were con&s;train'd to pay Five i'the Hundred Cu&s;toms, whereas the <HI>Engli&s;h, Hollanders</HI> and <HI>Genoe&s;es</HI> paid not above Three <HI>per Cent.</HI> That they had entertain'd the latter in <HI>Turkie,</HI> contrary to all his Remon&s;trances and Prote&s;ts, and had forc'd the <HI>French</HI> to pay within le&s;s then three Years, above Two Hun|dred Thou&s;and <HI>Livres,</HI> for unju&s;t and oppre&s;&s;ive Impo&s;itions. To which <HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Haye</HI> farther added, That if the&s;e Grievances might be taken into Con&s;ideration, &s;o that the Emperor his Ma&s;ter might be a&s;&s;ur'd of Redre&s;s, he did not
<PB N="26" REF="23">
que&s;tion but that his Maje&s;ty would re&s;t &s;atisfi'd and not recal him. Upon this the <HI>Caimacan</HI> made an&s;wer, That he would write to the <HI>Caimacan</HI> of the <HI>Port,</HI> who is al&s;o another of the <HI>Vizier</HI>'s Lieutenants, and one who never &s;tirs from the Per&s;on of the <HI>Grand Signior;</HI> and al&s;o that his <HI>Excellency</HI> would do well to write him&s;elf, which would add the greater weight, and give the quicker di&s;patch to the Affair. Neverthele&s;s all the An&s;wer which the <HI>Caimacan</HI> of the <HI>Port</HI> &s;ent to <HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Haye,</HI> was only this, That he would give an Accompt to the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> of what he had writ, and that he &s;hould know his An&s;wer with the fir&s;t Opportunity.</P>
<P>While the Amba&s;&s;ador tarry'd for this An&s;wer, Four of the Kings Men of War arriv'd in the Haven of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> being &s;ent to bring back the Amba&s;&s;ador. And this Squadron &s;truck no &s;mall fear into the <HI>Turks</HI> at fir&s;t; but finding that <HI>Mon&s;ieur d'Almeras,</HI> who was the Commander, had &s;ent to the City, &s;o &s;oon as he came to an Anchor, for Fifteen Hundred Weight of Bisket, and that with no &s;mall Importunity too, they began to &s;light him under the want of Provi&s;ion, and reduc'd to &s;uch a Condition that he could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t, if they &s;hould refu&s;e to &s;upply him.</P>
<P>In <HI>March</HI> 1669. <HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Haye</HI> receiv'd the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI>'s An&s;wer, containing a Permi&s;&s;ion to come to the Court; where he arriv'd in the Month of <HI>April.</HI> And here I &s;hall pa&s;s over the Motives and De&s;ign of this Journey, not but that I &s;ufficiently know what was di&s;cours'd at <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> but becau&s;e tho&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es were different from what <HI>Mon|&s;ieur de la Haye</HI> &s;ets down in the Relation which he gave the King at his Return to <HI>Paris;</HI> from whence I took the chiefe&s;t part of this Recital: and where he declares that he had no other end but to take his leave. Nor &s;hall I &s;ay any thing for the &s;ame Rea&s;on, of what he did at the <HI>Ottoman Court,</HI> from whence he wrote to Admiral <HI>d'Almeras,</HI> who then lay at <HI>Con|&s;tantinople</HI> with his Four Men of War to come and take aboard him at <HI>Vola,</HI> in the Golph of <HI>Salonica,</HI> a Turki&s;h Amba&s;&s;ador, which the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> was &s;ending into <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Turk</HI> was nam'd <HI>Soliman,</HI> being then <HI>Muttifar Aga,</HI> or the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s Porter. And when he was &s;ent to the <HI>French</HI> King, he was a Fellow that &s;erv'd for Fifteen <HI>A&s;pers,</HI> or about Six-pence a day. He arriv'd in <HI>France</HI> toward the end of the Year 1669. and departed thence the next Year in the Month of <HI>Augu&s;t.</HI> All <HI>Paris</HI> had a &s;ight of him, and they that were acquainted with him, knew him to be as haughty,
<PB N="27" REF="23">
as bruti&s;h, and as crafty a <HI>Turk</HI> as ever was in the World. The <HI>Proven&ccedil;alls</HI> that were in the <HI>Levant</HI> call'd him <HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Haye</HI>'s Amba&s;&s;ador, and took the Liberty to affirm that <HI>Mon|&s;ieur de la Haye</HI> furni&s;h'd him with Money for his Equipage. And they grounded their A&s;&s;ertion upon this, That <HI>Soliman</HI>'s Equipage was far &s;hort of the Magnificence of the Turki&s;h Amba&s;&s;adors. And <HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Haye,</HI> when he was jeer'd for <HI>Soliman</HI>'s Rigging, had no other way to ju&s;tifie him&s;elf, but by &s;aying, That <HI>Soliman</HI> had not time to make better Provi&s;ion for him&s;elf. Others would put it clo&s;er upon him, That the Title of <HI>AMBASSADOR</HI> was not to be found in <HI>Soliman</HI>'s Credentials. But for that he had another &s;hift, That while <HI>Soliman</HI> lay at <HI>Cale Saint Nicolas</HI> near <HI>Ce|rigo,</HI> expecting the Admiral's arrival to take him aboard, the <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> &s;ecure of taking <HI>Candy,</HI> and finding no farther nece&s;&s;ity to keep fair with <HI>France,</HI> or dread their A&s;|&s;i&s;tance, alter'd all <HI>Soliman</HI>'s Titles, In&s;tructions and Di&s;|patches; recalling the fir&s;t, and &s;ending him others: But that it was mo&s;t certain, that the Name and Title of <HI>Soli|man Aga</HI> were be&s;tow'd upon him in the Quality of an Amba&s;&s;a|dor; of which there needed no farther proof then this, That the Great Turk gave him the Scimitar and Ve&s;tment which he gives to his Amba&s;&s;adors, and that the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Napoli</HI> in <HI>Romania</HI> &s;aluted him with &s;everal Guns at his entrance into the Haven.</P>
<P>However it were, <HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Haye</HI> return'd to <HI>Con&s;tan|tinople</HI> in <HI>July,</HI> and three Months after he receiv'd Order to embark, if he could, aboard the Fleet under the Command of <HI>Mon&s;ieur d'Almeras;</HI> but if the <HI>Caimacan</HI> prevented him, that at the &s;ame In&s;tant he &s;hould lay down the Title of <HI>Amba&s;&s;ador,</HI> to the end the <HI>Turks</HI> might not have the Op|portunity to Glory that they had in their Power an Amba&s;&s;a|dor of <HI>France</HI> to abu&s;e at their plea&s;ure. But as I &s;aid be|fore, the Men of War were gone before this Order arriv'd: &s;o that <HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Haye</HI> could not obey the fir&s;t part of the Order; and as to the &s;econd, he excus'd him&s;elf, by wri|ting into <HI>France,</HI> That the <HI>Turks</HI> had a great Veneration and Re&s;pect for him.</P>
<P>But this excu&s;e not being &s;o throughly acceptable at Court, was the Occa&s;ion that <HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Haye</HI> was peremptorily recall'd. Be&s;ides the <HI>Proven&ccedil;als,</HI> were &s;o incens'd again&s;t him, that they &s;ent continually into <HI>France,</HI> clamouring that &s;o long as he &s;hould be continu'd Amba&s;&s;ador at the <HI>Port,</HI> the
<PB N="28" REF="24">
League would never be renew'd, neither would the Pa&s;&s;age to the <HI>Indies</HI> through the <HI>Red-Sea</HI> be obtain'd; in regard the <HI>Vi|zier</HI> had an old Grudge again&s;t his Per&s;on. Which Complaints being believ'd, it was re&s;olv'd that <HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Haye</HI> &s;hould be recall'd, and that <HI>M. de Nointel</HI> &s;hould be &s;ent in his &s;tead. Who was a Coun&s;ellor of the Parliament of <HI>Paris,</HI> a Per&s;on of great Integrity, and &s;o curious that his Curio&s;ity had carry'd him to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> before that Time; but he was of too mild a Di&s;po&s;ition to negociate in <HI>Turkie.</HI> Neither were they re|&s;olv'd at fir&s;t to have giv'n him any higher Title then that of <HI>Re&s;ident;</HI> till the Importunity of his Friends and of the <HI>Le|vant</HI> Company, procur'd him that of Amba&s;&s;ador. For the Company judging of what begat E&s;teem and Reverence among the <HI>Turks,</HI> by the Humours of the <HI>Europeans,</HI> repre&s;ented to the Chief Mini&s;ters of State, that in the tran&s;acting matters of &s;uch High-Importance, as the renewing of an Advantageous Peace and the obtaining a Free Trade to the <HI>Indies</HI> through the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> would &s;ooner conde&s;cend to the Dignity of an Amba&s;&s;ador, then the more ob&s;cure Quality of a Re&s;ident.</P>
<P><HI>Mon&s;ieur Nointel</HI> therefore departed out of <HI>France</HI> in the Month of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1670. together with the Turki&s;h Amba&s;&s;a|dor, <HI>Soliman Aga,</HI> and arriv'd at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> in <HI>October</HI> follow|ing; the King allowing him four Men of War for the &s;ecuri|ty of his Pa&s;&s;age under the Conduct of <HI>M. D'Aplemont.</HI> By the way I have heard &s;everal Per&s;ons of great Sagacity and Judgment affirm, that <HI>M. de la Haye</HI> had wrong done him, and that they were deceiv'd who vainly imagin'd that it was either out of di&s;re&s;pect to his Per&s;on, or for want of Good Management, that the <HI>Turks</HI> refus'd to renew the League at his Sollicitations. Which the Sequel of Affairs has ju&s;tifi'd for Truth, plainly demon&s;trating that the Blame was to be laid upon the Ill timing the Emba&s;&s;y, and the Potent Succors which the King of <HI>France</HI> &s;ent to <HI>Candy</HI> at the very In&s;tant when he had &s;ent his Amba&s;&s;ador to de&s;ire con&s;iderable Fa|vours and particular Advantages of the <HI>Grand Signior.</HI></P>
<P><HI>M. Nointel</HI> made a Magnificent Entry into <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> but the <HI>Turks</HI> were nothing pleas'd with &s;o much Pomp, al|together un&s;ea&s;onable, and no way agreeable to the Circum|&s;tances of Time and Bu&s;ine&s;s. The <HI>Ottoman</HI> Court was then at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> where <HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Haye</HI> with little difficulty obtain'd leave to depart, and to that purpo&s;e embark'd him&s;elf in the Admiral of the Squadron, Commanded by <HI>M d'Aplemont.</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="24">
But &s;oon after both the Admiral and the re&s;t of the Squadron were Imbargo'd before the <HI>Ca&s;tles,</HI> by rea&s;on of two Slaves that had made their e&s;capes, as was &s;uppos'd, into the French Ships. There were it &s;eems about an Hunderd in all, who had broke their Chains, of all &s;orts of Nations; of which Number was the <HI>Chevalier de Beaujeu,</HI> who had been a Pri|&s;oner in the <HI>Seven Towers.</HI> The <HI>Caimacan</HI> &s;ent to demand the Slaves of <HI>M. Nointel,</HI> and <HI>M. Nointel</HI> went to demand 'em of the Captains of the Men of War, who an&s;wer'd, That there were none &s;uch in any of their Ve&s;&s;els: and <HI>M. de la Haye</HI> was forc'd to write from the <HI>Dardanels</HI> to the <HI>Vizier</HI> to atte&s;t the &s;ame under his own Hand; who &s;eeming to be &s;atisfi'd with his an&s;wer, &s;ent an Order to let the Ve&s;&s;els go.</P>
<P>Sometime after the departure of <HI>M. de la Haye, M. Nointel</HI> went to <HI>Adrianople.</HI> Where he had all the u&s;ual Honours duly paid him; but demanded Audience before he had made known the Subject of his Negotiation at the <HI>Ottoman Port,</HI> which he &s;hould have declar'd before-hand. For it is the Law in <HI>Tur|kie,</HI> That all Amba&s;&s;adors before they &s;ee the Face of the Prime Mini&s;ter, or of the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> &s;hould &s;ignifie the Occa&s;ion of their Coming, what their Demands are, and what it is that they have in Commi&s;&s;ion to Treat about. And the &s;ame Law is ob&s;erv'd over all the <HI>Ea&s;t.</HI> Of which <HI>M. Nointel</HI> was not ignorant. But he found it in his In&s;tructions, That he &s;hould Negotiate his Affairs in Per&s;on with the <HI>Grand Vi|zier,</HI> and that he &s;hould not di&s;clo&s;e the Kings Orders but in a full <HI>Divan,</HI> when he might al&s;o &s;peak to the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> him&s;elf. Which was therefore &s;o re&s;olv'd upon in the Kings Council, becau&s;e it was &s;aid in <HI>France,</HI> That his Highne&s;s knew nothing of the Severities of the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> toward the <HI>French</HI> Nation; no more then did the <HI>Divan.</HI> That the Haughty Mini&s;ter refus'd to renew the Treaty of Alliance up|on the Kings Conditions, out of a particular hatred which he bore the <HI>French,</HI> and therefore it behov'd him to get him&s;elf out of his Clutches, and free him&s;elf from any Dependance upon his Ab&s;olute Authority. But it is a Failing predominant in all the Courts of <HI>Europe,</HI> that they take fal&s;e Mea&s;ures as to the Affairs of <HI>Turkey:</HI> a certain &s;ign that the <HI>Genius</HI> and Politicks of the <HI>Turks</HI> are not as yet rightly under&s;tood. How|ever mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly the&s;e Coun&s;els were ill given, and wor&s;e follow'd. For <HI>M. Nointel</HI> did all he could to ob&s;erve his Or|ders, &s;ometimes he would di&s;clo&s;e nothing at all; then again he was for di&s;covering part of his Commi&s;&s;ion: but finding
<PB N="30" REF="25">
he could not obtain Audience, he was forc'd to unbo&s;om him|&s;elf, and to &s;end a Memorial of all the Demands which he had to make at the <HI>Ottoman Port.</HI></P>
<P>This Memorial he gave to the <HI>Vizier</HI>'s Interpreter, who&s;e Name was <HI>Panaioti;</HI> a Grecian, and a Man of a piercing Wit, who under&s;tood &s;everal of the <HI>European</HI> Languages; and among the re&s;t <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Italian,</HI> which he writ as well as &s;poke with great Judgment and Dexterity. He was a Per&s;on untaintedly faithful to the <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> and it appear'd that he was intire|ly devoted to the Intere&s;ts of the <HI>Port,</HI> to the prejudice of the Chri&s;tians. Which firmne&s;s of his, whether it proceeded from a dread of the Turki&s;h Severity in the puni&s;hment of Trea&s;on and Treachery, or the Obligations of his Birth, or the Influ|ences of Turki&s;h Slavery, I will not here di&s;pute; however it be, he bears the Title of <HI>Chief Interpreter,</HI> and <HI>Secretary</HI> of the <HI>Ottoman Empire.</HI> The Commonwealth of <HI>Genoa</HI> al&s;o made him a Noble-Man of that City for the good Offices he did their Amba&s;&s;ador the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Durazzo.</HI> He was Inter|preter to the Emperor of <HI>Germany,</HI> before he &s;erv'd the <HI>Vizier;</HI> who allow'd him a Pen&s;ion of a Thou&s;and Crowns, which as &s;ome &s;ay is &s;till privately paid him. And moreover he had the chief Management of the Treaty of Peace between the two Empires, which was not &s;o honourable for <HI>Germany.</HI> He al&s;o carry'd on the Treaty of <HI>Candy,</HI> wherein he acted &s;o much to the Satisfaction of the <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> that at the time of the Ratification he gave him the Revenue of the I&s;land of <HI>Micone</HI> in the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> worth Four Thou&s;and Crowns a Year. I have been the longer in giving an Accompt of this <HI>Panaioti,</HI> becau&s;e he is a Per&s;on &s;o well known to all that have Bu&s;ine&s;s at the <HI>Port:</HI> as being the only Man that Treats in the <HI>Vizier</HI>'s behalf with all Chri&s;tians that make their Addre&s;&s;es to him, of what Quality &s;oever, and what&s;oever their Bu&s;ine&s;s may be.</P>
<P>The Amba&s;&s;adors Demands were comprehended under Thir|ty Articles, of which the&s;e were the chief.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>That the</HI> Grand Signior <HI>&s;hould not entertain within his Dominions any</HI> European <HI>Nation, except what were already &s;etl'd there, but under the</HI> French <HI>Banners; and that particularly the</HI> Italians, <HI>except the</HI> Venetians <HI>and</HI> Genoe&s;es, <HI>that &s;hould come into</HI> Turkey, <HI>&s;hould be oblig'd to put them&s;elves under the Ban|ner of</HI> France, <HI>and the Protection of that King's Amba&s;&s;ador.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="25">
This Priviledge was granted by the <HI>Turks</HI> to the <HI>French</HI> in the Capitulations made in the Reign of <HI>Francis</HI> the Fir&s;t, and the <HI>French</HI> enjoy'd 'em till the beginning of this Age; at what time by rea&s;on of certain Pyrates that Cruis'd upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Egypt</HI> under <HI>French</HI> Colours, the <HI>Port</HI> &s;truck out that Article in a new Agreement then concluded. Afterwards the Article was re&s;tor'd, and the &s;ame Priviledge granted a &s;econd time in the&s;e words.</P>
<P><HI>All Nations of</HI> Europe, <HI>that do not maintain Publick Agents at the</HI> Port, <HI>nor are in Alliance and Confederacy with the</HI> Grand Signior, <HI>which &s;hall come into the</HI> Levant <HI>under French Colours, &s;hall be there receiv'd and entertain'd, and enjoy the &s;ame Ad|vantages which the</HI> French <HI>do.</HI> But the <HI>Turks</HI> refu&s;e to acknow|ledge the&s;e latter Capitulations; and therefore making u&s;e of the former, they alledge moreover, That the words <HI>[&s;hall come]</HI> are not exclu&s;ive; and therefore though the <HI>Port</HI> be oblig'd to receive all Strangers that <HI>&s;hall come</HI> under <HI>French</HI> Colours, yet they do not debar the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> to entertain Strangers, if it be his Plea&s;ure, that come under other Co|lours.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>That the</HI> French <HI>&s;hall not pay above Three in the Hunderd Cu&s;toms, which is no more then the</HI> Engli&s;h, Hollan|ders, <HI>and</HI> Genoe&s;es <HI>do.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>That the</HI> Grand Signior <HI>&s;hall grant Free Liberty to the</HI> French <HI>to Traffick to the</HI> Indies, <HI>through his Dominions and Territories, more e&s;pecially through the Channel of the</HI> Red-Sea, <HI>without paying any other Duties then tho&s;e of Entrage.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, <HI>That the</HI> Grand Signior <HI>&s;hall re&s;tore to the Reli|gious Orders of the Roman Catholicks the</HI> Holy Land, <HI>and the Holy Places from whence they were expell'd by the</HI> Greeks <HI>in the Year</HI> 1638.</P>
<P>Fifthly, <HI>That the King of</HI> France <HI>&s;hall be acknowledg'd at the</HI> Port, <HI>the Sole Protector of the Chri&s;tians.</HI></P>
<P>Sixthly, <HI>That all the Roman Catholick Chri&s;tians that live within the Dominions of the</HI> Ottoman <HI>Empire, &s;hall be lookt up|on and con&s;ider'd as under the Protection of his Maje&s;ty.</HI></P>

<P>Eighthly, <HI>That all the Churches of the Roman Chri&s;tians with|in the</HI> Ottoman <HI>Empire, may for the future be Repair'd or Re|built, as often as need &s;hall require, without being put to the Trouble of asking Leave.</HI></P>
<P>Ninthly, <HI>That all the</HI> French <HI>Slaves &s;hall be &s;et at Liberty.</HI></P>
<P>The other Propo&s;als were of le&s;s Importance in particular, only their Number render'd 'em con&s;iderable. But the <HI>Port</HI> look'd upon the&s;e Demands to be &s;o extravagant, nay &s;o ridi|culous, that the Prime Mini&s;ters believ'd, or el&s;e pretended to believe, that the King &s;ought only an Occa&s;ion to break with his Highne&s;s. Thereupon the <HI>Vizier</HI> &s;ent to know of the Amba&s;&s;ador, Whether he had any Letter from the Emperor of <HI>France</HI> directed to the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> or Him, which con|tain'd tho&s;e Propo&s;als, &s;et down in the Memorial which he had deliver'd in his Maje&s;ties Name. For that he could ne|ver think the Emperor of <HI>France</HI> would ever give Order to make &s;uch Propo&s;als to the <HI>Port,</HI> &s;o exorbitant, and &s;o remote from Rea&s;on and Ju&s;tice in his own Name, unle&s;s he &s;aw 'em expre&s;ly written in any Letter under his Maje&s;ties Hand. <HI>M. de Nointel</HI> taking no farther notice of the <HI>Vizier</HI>'s Demand, return'd only for an&s;wer, That he had Letters of Credence from his Ma&s;ter for the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> and the <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> which was &s;ufficient, for that his Maje&s;ty did not u&s;e to write about Bu&s;ine&s;s him&s;elf. And therefore that the <HI>Port</HI> was un|der a mi&s;take to que&s;tion the Mind and Intentions of the Em|peror of <HI>France,</HI> becau&s;e it was not &s;hown in Writing under his Maje&s;ties Hand. True it is, that the Amba&s;&s;ador &s;poke Rea&s;on, and the Impediment pretended by the <HI>Vizier</HI> was only a Litigious Nicety. However, notwith&s;tanding all that <HI>M. de Nointel</HI> could &s;ay or alledge to the contrary, he would not grant him Audience, till he promis'd and engag'd to &s;end for a Letter from the King that &s;hould contain preci&s;ely the &s;ame things that were &s;et down in his Memorial, and that the Letter &s;hould come in &s;ix Months.</P>
<P>It was toward the end of <HI>February</HI> 1671. that <HI>M. de Nointel</HI> made this promi&s;e: and the next day the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> &s;ent to

him, to let him know that on the Morrow he &s;hould have Au|dience of him&s;elf, and that two days after he &s;hould have Au|dience of the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> likewi&s;e, upon condition that he would not di&s;cour&s;e of any Bu&s;ine&s;s True it is, the <HI>Vizier</HI> gave him but a cold Reception. For the Amba&s;&s;ador entring into di&s;cour&s;e upon &s;everal Subjects, which were all too long and tedious for the Turki&s;h Humour, they went in at one Ear and out at the t'other: The <HI>Vizier</HI> for the mo&s;t part giving him no other An&s;wer but only a &s;hort <HI>Yes,</HI> or as brief a <HI>No.</HI> Particularly <HI>Mon&s;ieur Nointel</HI> enlarg'd upon the Grandeur of the King, and his va&s;t Forces: which the <HI>Vizier</HI> taking to be a kind of &s;ecret Threatning, <HI>Yes,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>the Emperor of</HI> France <HI>is a Great Monarch, but his Sword is but a new Weapon yet.</HI> In|timating that the King had done no Exploits that de&s;erv'd &s;uch loud Elogies; but therein he was not well inform'd of what had pa&s;s'd among the Chri&s;tian Princes. Neither did <HI>Mon&s;ieur Nointel</HI> e&s;cape &s;ome other Quips of the &s;ame Nature. For the Amba&s;&s;ador talking of the Antiquity of the Alliance between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Turkey,</HI> was &s;aying, <HI>That the</HI> French <HI>were the</HI> Turks <HI>true Friends.</HI> To which the <HI>Vizier</HI> &s;miling, <HI>Ay,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>the</HI> French <HI>are our Friends indeed, but we always find 'em among our Enemies.</HI> But the next was more home and &s;harp.</P>
<P>The Amba&s;&s;ador being ready to take his leave, order'd the Interpreter to tell the <HI>Vizier, That he had Orders from the Em|peror his Ma&s;ter, earne&s;tly to recommend to him the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the</HI> Red-Sea. <HI>That it was a Thing which his Maje&s;ty had &s;et his Heart upon, and de&s;ir'd the</HI> Port <HI>would give him Satisfaction in that Particular with all Expedition.</HI> To whom the <HI>Vizier</HI> drily, <HI>Can it be,</HI> &s;aid He, <HI>That your Emperor, &s;o great a Monarch as you &s;ay he is, &s;hould &s;et his Heart &s;o affectionately upon the profit of his Merchants?</HI></P>
<P>Nor was the Amba&s;&s;ador better &s;atisfy'd with the Audi|ence which he had of the <HI>Grand Signior.</HI> For after he had made his Reverence, they led him up to the end of the Room of State, Face to Face to his Highne&s;s, to whom he made his Harangue, which la&s;ted about a quarter of an Hour. But it &s;ignify'd little. For the Interpreter explain'd no more then the Sen&s;e of it to the <HI>Vizier,</HI> which the <HI>Vizier</HI> abbrevia|ted in two words to the <HI>Grand Signior.</HI> Which done, <HI>M. de Nointel</HI> began to di&s;cour&s;e of Bu&s;ine&s;s to his Highne&s;s; con|trary to Cu&s;tom, to the <HI>Vizier</HI>'s Reque&s;t, and his own Pro|mi&s;e. The <HI>Grand Signior</HI> li&s;ten'd attentively to what the In|terpreter &s;aid, and for an&s;wer, looking upon the <HI>Vizier,</HI> who
<PB N="34" REF="27">
upon &s;uch Occa&s;ions is always near the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s Per&s;on, <HI>This Amba&s;&s;ador,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to our</HI> Lala. Which word <HI>Lala</HI> &s;ignifies both a <HI>Tutor,</HI> and a <HI>Father.</HI> The <HI>Turks</HI> made u&s;e of the word, to denote a Per&s;on who has a particular Care and paternal affection for another.</P>
<P>Then again, it is the Cu&s;tom, after the Amba&s;&s;ador has had his Audience of the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> for him to Dine in the <HI>Divan,</HI> where the Amba&s;&s;ador &s;its with the <HI>Grand Vizier;</HI> and the Gentlemen of his Retinue Eat with the <HI>Viziers of the Bench;</HI> who are the Greate&s;t Lords of the Empire. There would <HI>M. de Nointel</HI> be talking al&s;o of bu&s;ine&s;s. Which put the <HI>Vizier</HI> &s;o out of Patience, that being forc'd to be &s;omewhat rude with him, after he had de&s;ir'd him to be &s;ilent, <HI>Good Mr. Amba&s;&s;ador,</HI> &s;aid He, <HI>Keep to your promi&s;e, in Six Months we &s;hall under&s;tand whither you are Friends or Enemies.</HI></P>
<P>This was the fir&s;t Di&s;appointment of <HI>M. de Nointel,</HI> and the &s;ucce&s;s of his Journy to <HI>Adrianople.</HI> He return'd to <HI>Con|&s;tantinople</HI> in <HI>March</HI> 1671. from whence he wrote to <HI>France,</HI> what he had done at the <HI>Port,</HI> and upon what Terms he &s;tood with the <HI>Vizier.</HI> By which it was apparent to the Court, that the <HI>Vizier</HI> did but make &s;port with the Amba&s;&s;ador and the <HI>French.</HI> Upon which it was debated whether they &s;hould break with the <HI>Port,</HI> or whether they &s;hould di&s;&s;emble &s;uch an Affrontive Entertainment. And therefore that they might not proceed with too much Precipitancy in an Affair of that Importance, the Chief Pre&s;ident of <HI>Aix, M. d'Oppede,</HI> was order'd to a&s;&s;em|ble at <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> all the <HI>Levant</HI> Merchants, and others that were ver&s;t in the Affairs of <HI>Turkey,</HI> and to take their Opinions up|on what &s;everal People had offer'd to the Council. <HI>That</HI> France <HI>might refrain from Trading into the</HI> Levant, <HI>at lea&s;t for &s;everal Years, and that it was ea&s;ie to do &s;o much Dammage to the</HI> Turks <HI>by Sea, that the</HI> Grand Signior <HI>&s;hould be con&s;train'd to grant his Maje&s;ty his own Demands.</HI> Upon which the Re&s;ult of the A&s;&s;embly, by the Plurality of Voices was, <HI>That the Pro|po&s;alls were certainly true; that</HI> Provence <HI>was &s;o &s;ufficiently &s;tock'd with</HI> Turkey <HI>Commodities, that there was enough to furni&s;h</HI> France <HI>for Ten Years: And that if the King would &s;end but Ten Ve&s;&s;els into the</HI> Grecian Seas, <HI>and particularly to the</HI> Dardanels, <HI>there would &s;oon be &s;uch a Famine in</HI> Con&s;tanti|nople, <HI>that the People would certainly make an In&s;urrection to the Advantage of the</HI> French.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="27">
Upon this the <HI>Proven&ccedil;alls</HI> made no que&s;tion but that there would &s;uddainly be a War with the <HI>Grand Signior.</HI> They wrote over all the <HI>Levant,</HI> what had pa&s;s'd at <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> and a&s;&s;ur'd their Friends that the King was &s;etting forth a Fleet of Fifty Ships to &s;end again&s;t the <HI>Turks.</HI> And <HI>M. de Nointel</HI> reciev'd Letters from <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> which a&s;certain'd him the &s;ame thing. In &s;o much that the News was &s;pread in an In&s;tant through <HI>Con&s;tantinople, Adrianople,</HI> and over all the Ports of the <HI>Levant.</HI> Be&s;ides, I have been credibly inform'd, that the <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> and all the Prime Mini&s;ters of the <HI>Port,</HI> were very much &s;tartl'd at it. In&s;omuch that he &s;ent to the other Amba&s;&s;adors and Re&s;idents of Chri&s;tendom, to know whi|ther the King of <HI>France</HI> intended a War, and were making preparations for it. To which they all &s;ent him an&s;wer, that it was true that the <HI>French</HI> were &s;etting forth a very great Fleet. But whither it were de&s;ign'd again&s;t <HI>Turkey</HI> or no, they could not tell: but the general Report, and that which they believ'd to be the true&s;t was, that they were intended again&s;t the <HI>Hollan|ders.</HI> Which An&s;wers abated the Fears of the <HI>Turks;</HI> and &s;oon after a French Bark arriving in two Months at <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople</HI> rid 'em of all their Jealou&s;ies. For tho they thought at fir&s;t, that it had been a Boat which had brought fre&s;h Orders to the Amba&s;&s;ador and for all the <HI>French</HI> Nation; yet were they no le&s;s glad, when the Ma&s;ter being ask'd, where the <HI>French</HI> Fleet lay, that was de&s;ign'd again&s;t the <HI>Turks,</HI> made an|&s;wer, that he did not under&s;tand what they meant; that he had heard no talk of a Fleet, and that he was &s;ure there was no &s;uch thing, as any Preparations at <HI>Toulon.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t of <HI>September,</HI> the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> wrote to <HI>M. de Nointel, That the Six Months were expir'd, which was the time he had tak'n to &s;end for a Letter from his Ma&s;ter; de&s;iring far|ther to know whether it were come, what it contain'd, and what In&s;tructions he had receiv'd from his Maje&s;ty.</HI> To which the Amba&s;&s;ador reply'd by word of Mouth to the Me&s;&s;enger who brought the Letter, <HI>That the Emperor of</HI> France's<HI> An&s;wer was not yet come, which was all he could &s;ay to the</HI> Grand Vizier, <HI>be|ing re&s;olv'd not to give any other An&s;wer to a Letter, that did not give his Ma&s;ter all the Titles that belong'd to his Imperial Maje&s;ty.</HI> Which <HI>M. de Nointel</HI> did on purpo&s;e, for that the <HI>Vizier</HI> had not given the King either in his Letter, or in the Super&s;cripti|on, any other Title then that of <HI>Craul,</HI> which among the <HI>Turks</HI> is not &s;o high as that of <HI>Padcha,</HI> though they both &s;ignifie a Soveraign Prince. But <HI>Padcha</HI> is the Title which they always
<PB N="36" REF="28">
give the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> and which they were always wont to allow the King of <HI>France. Padcha</HI> being a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> word; <HI>Craul</HI> a <HI>Sclavonian,</HI> and the very Title which the <HI>Polonians</HI> give their King: and in <HI>France</HI> the word <HI>Padcha</HI> is tak'n for Emperor.</P>
<P>All this while the Re&s;olutions and Re&s;ults of the Council of <HI>France</HI> in reference to the Affairs of the <HI>Levant,</HI> after the A&s;&s;embly held at <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> did not an&s;wer publick Expecta|tion in the Pro&s;ecution of that A&s;&s;emblies Advice. For the King de&s;igning a War with <HI>Holland,</HI> would not engage in another with <HI>Turkey</HI> at the &s;ame time, which requir'd the be&s;t part of his Navy to maintain. Therefore he re&s;olv'd to &s;pin out time, and to endeavour an Accommodation; that &s;o he might not be oblig'd to break with the <HI>Turks.</HI> To which purpo&s;e <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Lyone</HI> wrote to the <HI>Vizier, That the Em|peror of</HI> France <HI>admir'd he &s;hould refu&s;e to give Credit to his Am|ba&s;&s;ador, &s;ince the</HI> Port <HI>had never till then que&s;tion'd the Truth and Reality of the Propo&s;als of the</HI> French <HI>Amba&s;&s;adors. That his Imperial Maje&s;ty would not trouble him&s;elf to explain his mean|ing any otherwi&s;e then by his Amba&s;&s;ador</HI> M. de Nointel: <HI>&s;o that if the</HI> Grand Signior <HI>or his Mini&s;ters refus'd to give him Cre|dence, they would do well to let him return in the Ve&s;&s;el that brought the Letter.</HI></P>
<P>With this Letter <HI>M. d'Hervieu,</HI> Interpreter to the <HI>Dolphin,</HI> and at pre&s;ent Con&s;ul at <HI>Aleppo,</HI> was &s;ent, having Orders to deliver it him&s;elf to the <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> and withal to carry the King's la&s;t In&s;tructions to the Amba&s;&s;ador. He fet Sail from <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> in <HI>September,</HI> in one of the King's Men of War call'd the <HI>Diamond,</HI> commanded by the <HI>Marqui&s;s de Prully,</HI> but did not arrive at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> till <HI>February</HI> following, bad Weather having detain'd him Four Months between <HI>Malta</HI> and <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI></P>
<P>So &s;oon as the Ve&s;&s;el arriv'd, and that <HI>M. de Nointel</HI> had &s;een the King's In&s;tructions, he wrote to the <HI>Vizier, That his Ma|je&s;ties An&s;wer was at length come, after it had been Five Months upon the Seas, and that he only tarry'd for Leave to appear at Court, that he might impart it to him.</HI> To which the <HI>Vizier</HI> return'd an&s;wer, <HI>That he might come when he pleas'd, and be Welcom.</HI> More then that, he had &s;uper&s;crib'd his Letter ac|cording to the Ancient Cu&s;tom, <HI>To the Amba&s;&s;ador of the Em|peror of</HI> France; whereas he had only writ upon his former, <HI>To the Amba&s;&s;ador of the King of</HI> France. The &s;ame day al&s;o that the Amba&s;&s;ador receiv'd this Letter, the <HI>Caimacan</HI> &s;ent a
<PB N="37" REF="28">
Me&s;&s;enger to him, to let him know, <HI>That he had Order from the</HI> Vizier <HI>to furni&s;h his Excellency with Thirty Wagons, Twelve Hor&s;es, and a Thou&s;and Crowns toward the Expence of his Jour|ney; which &s;hould be &s;ent him with all &s;peed.</HI> In &s;hort, the Money was brought the next day, and the Wagons and Hor|&s;es were punctually ready according to the time which the Am|ba&s;&s;ador had prefix'd.</P>
<P>And this was the State of Affairs and Condition of the Al|liance between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Turkey</HI> when I arriv'd at <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople</HI> in <HI>March</HI> 1672.</P>
<P>The Amba&s;&s;ador departed from <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> the 29th of <HI>March,</HI> carrying along with him the Abbot of <HI>Nointel</HI> his Bro|ther, a Gentleman, a Confe&s;&s;or, a Steward, a Secretary, three Interpreters, two Jani&s;aries, and of meaner Officers a com|petent Retinue. Be&s;ides all the&s;e, he had al&s;o in his Train, M. <HI>d'Hervieu,</HI> who brought the Letter from M. <HI>de Lyonne</HI> to the <HI>Vizier;</HI> one of the Directors of the <HI>Levant Company,</HI> who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s it was to Treat about the Conditions of the <HI>Red-Sea-Trade;</HI> Two Spani&s;h Fryers, <HI>Commi&s;&s;aries</HI> of the <HI>Holy Land,</HI> who were to &s;ollicite the Re&s;titution of the Sacred <HI>Places,</HI> from whence they had been expell'd by the <HI>Greeks</HI> by Authority from the <HI>Port,</HI> about Thirty Years before; a Mer|chant of <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> who had Bu&s;ine&s;s at the <HI>Part,</HI> together with Four <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI> Gentlemen, who, as I my &s;elf, made that Journey meerly out of Curio&s;ity. The <HI>Caimacan</HI> al&s;o &s;ent a <HI>Chiaus</HI> to attend the Amba&s;&s;ador, to provide him Convenient Lodging, and to pre&s;erve that Re&s;pect to his Per|&s;on, and his Retinue, which the <HI>Turks</HI> are &s;ubject to violate upon the &s;lighte&s;t Occa&s;ions, if not overaw'd by the dread of Puni&s;hment. We were Six Days upon the Road; it being reck'nd Fifty Leagues between <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> and <HI>Adrianople.</HI> A Road no way to be found fault with, as being very broad and level, over Plains, and a lovely Champain Country: be|&s;ides that we pa&s;s'd through a great many very neat Villages, accommodated with fair and hand&s;om Inns.</P>
<P>We lodg'd half a League from <HI>Adrianople,</HI> in a mo&s;t plea|&s;ant Situation, upon the River <HI>Hebrus,</HI> call'd <HI>Bo&s;na-Koy,</HI> that is, the Village of the <HI>Bo&s;neans.</HI> Ten days after our Arrival, <HI>Panaioti,</HI> the <HI>Vizier</HI>'s Interpreter, of whom we have already &s;pok'n, came to vi&s;it the Amba&s;&s;ador in his Ma&s;ters Name, and to know the King's Re&s;olutions touching the renewing of the Alliance. After which Preamble to M. <HI>de Nointel,</HI> he told him, That it was the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI>'s Opinion, that it was not
<PB N="38" REF="29">
convenient for him and the Amba&s;&s;ador to have any Per&s;onal Interviews and Di&s;cour&s;e together, till all Affairs were con|cluded and fully agreed, for fear le&s;t any Exceptions or Diffe|rences &s;hould happ'n between 'em, which though but upon &s;light and impertinent <HI>Punctilio</HI>'s, might break or put a &s;top to the Negotiation, and hinder its good &s;ucce&s;s. To which <HI>Pa|naioti</HI> added, as it were in Confirmation of the <HI>Vizier</HI>'s Judg|ment, That Affairs in <HI>Turkey</HI> were never well manag'd, un|le&s;s it were by a Third Per&s;on, in regard the <HI>Vizier</HI> and the Amba&s;&s;ador being equally concern'd to pre&s;erve the Honour and Intere&s;ts of two great Empires, neither of the two would be the fir&s;t that &s;hould forego the &s;malle&s;t Tittle of their Pre|ten&s;ions; but that a Treaty carry'd on by their Interpreters could not ea&s;ily produce tho&s;e unlucky Accidents either in the One or the Other. In &s;hort therefore, the <HI>Vizier</HI> de&s;ir'd that favour of him, that he might not give him Audience, but only to deliver into his Hands the new Articles of Peace and Agree|ment. M. <HI>de Nointel</HI> could have wi&s;h'd with all his Heart, it might have been otherwi&s;e: but there was a Nece&s;&s;ity of con|de&s;cending to the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI>'s Plea&s;ure, which was to Treat by the Intercour&s;e of Interpreters. Thereupon <HI>Panaioti</HI> took the Letter which M. <HI>de Lyonne</HI> had written to the <HI>Vizier,</HI> and the Memorial of the Conditions upon which his Maje&s;ty was re&s;olv'd to renew the <HI>Alliance,</HI> and no otherwi&s;e, as the Am|ba&s;&s;ador alledg'd; and &s;o took his Leave, after he had made a Thou&s;and Vows and Prote&s;tations to the Amba&s;&s;ador of the Services he would do in that Negotiation. Particularly he told him, That he took it for &s;o great an Honour to have the Management of this New League between the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> and the Emperor of <HI>France,</HI> that there was no way or means which he would leave un&s;tudy'd that he might bring it to a Conclu&s;ion, to the Satisfaction of his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty. But Time di&s;cover'd, that his Prote&s;tations were altogether deceitful and fallacious, and that <HI>Panaioti</HI> had not the &s;ame In|clinations for the Intere&s;ts of <HI>France</HI> as for tho&s;e of the <HI>Grand Vizier.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t then, the <HI>Vizier</HI> read over the Amba&s;&s;ador's Memo|rial, and then gave it to be examin'd in the <HI>Divan.</HI> It was not &s;o long by half as that which he had pre&s;ented the time before, as not containing above Eleven Heads. Neverthele&s;s he found it to be very Extravagant. So that when the mo&s;t Con&s;iderable Articles were read, he would &s;till cry, The <HI>Port</HI> will never grant 'em. Upon others he would pa&s;s Sentence,
<PB N="39" REF="29">
&s;aying, This may be granted; and we &s;hall endeavour to pa&s;s over &s;uch an Ob&s;tacle and to remove &s;uch and &s;uch Difficul|ties. So that he ab&s;olutely refus'd one part of the Demands, and gave his Opinion of the re&s;t but very doubtfully. Which was a piece of Policy in the <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> to di&s;cover by the Amba&s;&s;ador's An&s;wers whether it were true that his In&s;tru|ctions were not to recede in the lea&s;t from his Memoires. And it fell out according to his de&s;ire, for by that means he found that the Amba&s;&s;ador had private Orders.</P>
<P>At the end of <HI>April,</HI> the two Fryers, Commi&s;&s;aries for the <HI>Holy Land,</HI> were very much troubl'd at a Report that ran among our &s;elves, That they needed not to tarry, as they did, in expectation of being re&s;tor'd to the Sacred Places, from which the Greeks had expell'd 'em, for that the <HI>Vizier</HI> having declar'd, That he would agree to the Abatement of the Cu|&s;toms, and the <HI>Red-Sea-Trade,</HI> on Condition the Amba&s;&s;ador would not in&s;i&s;t upon the <HI>Holy-Land,</HI> he had an&s;wer'd, <HI>That that was a Point to be re&s;erv'd till the la&s;t.</HI> Which becau&s;e it is an Affair of much Curio&s;ity, I &s;hall here &s;et down the principal Pa&s;&s;ages relating to it; withal in &s;ome mea&s;ure to divert the Reader, weary'd perhaps with a long Story of the French Negotiations at the <HI>Ottoman Port,</HI> for the Renewing of an Al|liance.</P>
<P>The Kingdom of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> was Conquer'd by the Chri&s;tians in the Year 1099. and lo&s;t in the Year 1177. At what time a certain King of <HI>Syria</HI> who&s;e Name was <HI>Nezer-Salah-el-din-Jo&s;eph</HI> reconquer'd it, and expell'd all the We&s;tern Chri&s;tians, e&s;pecially the <HI>Knights;</HI> leaving only behind the Oriental Chri|&s;tians, <HI>Syrians, Armenians, Georgians</HI> and <HI>Greeks.</HI> In a &s;hort time after one of the Kings of <HI>Naples,</HI> of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Anjou,</HI> purchas'd of the King of <HI>Syria</HI> the Sacred Places of <HI>Pale&s;tine.</HI> However the Bargain was kept &s;ecret, the King of <HI>Syria</HI> being afraid le&s;t the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Princes his Neighbours, &s;hould re|proach him for what he had done, and quarrel with him about the Sale. Thereupon the <HI>Franci&s;can</HI> Monks were &s;ent to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Sacred Places according to the Compact, who continu'd there, and were confirm'd by the <HI>Soldans</HI> of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and the Turki&s;h Emperors who afterwards Conquer'd <HI>Pale|&s;tine.</HI></P>
<P>All this while the Fryers had the Keys and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of whatever Chri&s;tian Devotion had Con&s;ecrated at <HI>Jeru&s;alem, Bethlehem, Nazareth,</HI> and in all other Sacred Places of the <HI>Holy Land.</HI> Moreover, the Ea&s;tern Chri&s;tians, who were very
<PB N="40" REF="30">
numerous, had al&s;o their Chappels in &s;everal of tho&s;e Holy Places, as well in the Church built upon the Sepulchre of Chri&s;t, as in tho&s;e that were rear'd in the Places where he was Born and Crucifi'd. The Popes likewi&s;e who make it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to bring over to their Communion all the <HI>Greeks,</HI> commanded the <HI>Franci&s;cans</HI> that they &s;hould have all manner of Liberty in the <HI>Holy Places,</HI> and withal to permit 'em to build Chappels, to keep Lamps and Tapers burning, and to erect Images and Altars.</P>
<P>This Allurement of &s;o much Freedom, which the <HI>Greeks</HI> en|joy'd in their Churches, &s;ay the <HI>Franci&s;cans,</HI> was that which entic'd 'em into a de&s;ign to make them&s;elves the &s;ole Ma&s;ters of tho&s;e Places; though the <HI>Greeks</HI> mo&s;t &s;tiffly deny any &s;uch thing. However it were, in the Year 1634. the <HI>Greeks</HI> repair'd to the <HI>Port,</HI> and there produc'd &s;everal Ancient Records, &s;etting forth their Title to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mount <HI>Calvary,</HI> the <HI>Grotto</HI> of <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> and other Places. Thereupon the <HI>Franci&s;cans</HI> were cited to the <HI>Divan;</HI> who appear'd with the Amba&s;&s;adors of the Chri&s;tian Princes that were then re&s;ident at the <HI>Port:</HI> and the Cau&s;e was &s;everal times argu'd before the <HI>Prime Vizier.</HI> All the Chri&s;tians al&s;o who were in Alliance with the <HI>Port,</HI> as well Prote&s;tants as Roman Catholicks, intere&s;ted them&s;elves in the Suit; and both &s;ides were at extraordinary Expences. But at length the <HI>Greeks</HI> gain'd the Cau&s;e, and were put into po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Holy Places, according to their own de&s;ires.</P>
<P>The <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> who gave Judgment in favour of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> being dead at the end of two Years, the <HI>Europeans</HI> demanded a Rehearing of the Cau&s;e. Which was granted, and it went clearly for the <HI>Franci&s;cans,</HI> who were thereupon re&s;tor'd to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what the <HI>Greeks</HI> got from 'em, but they did not keep it above two Years more. For after that, another <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> more favourable to the <HI>Greeks,</HI> re&s;etl'd 'em again in all the Places which had been recover'd by the <HI>Franci&s;cans</HI> four Years before. After that, the <HI>Latins</HI> us'd great Endeavours to regain the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, but all to no pur|po&s;e, the <HI>Divan</HI> being &s;till deaf to all their Sollicitations, Pro|mi&s;es and Offers; and con&s;tantly alledging, That it was not ju&s;t, that the <HI>Greeks,</HI> who were the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s Subjects, and who paid him the yearly Tribute of Eight Hunderd Thou|&s;and Crowns, &s;hould be depriv'd their &s;hare of the Cu&s;tody of the Sacred Places in <HI>Pale&s;tine,</HI> which was part of the Demea&s;ns of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire. Yet for all that, the <HI>Franci&s;cans</HI> have
<PB N="41" REF="30">
not forborn to renew their Importunities, their Petitions, and their Offers of Money, as often as they found any &s;ea&s;onable Opportunities to do it. In the Year 1665. <HI>Count Le&s;ley</HI> in the Name of the Emperor took all the care and pains imaginable for the Re&s;toration of the <HI>Franci&s;cans</HI> to their Rights, pray'd, pay'd and promis'd Mountains, but all was labour lo&s;t. Four Years after, the <HI>Procurator Molino</HI> in the Name of the <HI>Republic</HI> of <HI>Venice</HI> undertook their Cau&s;e with the &s;ame Vigour; &s;o that the <HI>Franci&s;cans</HI> had now no other hopes but in the King of <HI>France.</HI> To which purpo&s;e they deputed two of their Order to his Maje&s;ty, who pre&s;ented him with Letters of Recom|mendation from <HI>Rome, Spain,</HI> and the mo&s;t part of the Ro|man Catholick Princes, to make u&s;e of his Credit and Reputa|tion in the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Court, for the Re&s;toration of the <HI>Latins</HI> into the Sacred Places, from whence they had been expell'd by the <HI>Greeks.</HI> But there was no need of a Recommendation to excite the King in the pro&s;ecution of &s;uch a Pious Act, to which his own Zeal was a &s;ufficient Incentive. Immediately therefore he wrote to <HI>M. de la Haye</HI> to in&s;ert the Demands of tho&s;e Religious Per&s;ons among the Conditions for the renew|ing the Alliance. And after that, both <HI>M. de la Haye,</HI> and <HI>M. de Nointel</HI> prote&s;ted to 'em &s;everal times, That they had ex|pre&s;s Orders not to Treat with the <HI>Port,</HI> nor to renew the Ar|ticles of <HI>Alliance,</HI> unle&s;s they would re&s;tore the <HI>Franci&s;cans</HI> to the Places they had lo&s;t. Neverthele&s;s it appear'd at the end of <HI>April,</HI> that an Affair of that Nature might be di&s;penc'd with|al, rather then to put a &s;top to &s;uch an Important Treaty for the Cu&s;tody of three or four &s;illy Chappels.</P>
<P>The&s;e two Fryers told me, how that upon their Arrival at <HI>Con&s;tantinople, M. de la Haye</HI> bid 'em re&s;t &s;atisfi'd; for that he under&s;tood &s;o well the Re&s;olutions of the Prime Mini&s;ters of the <HI>Port,</HI> that they would never renew the Treaty, upon the Conditions which the King demanded, in regard the Re&s;tora|tion of the <HI>Sacred Places,</HI> upon which the King &s;o firmly in|&s;i&s;ted, was an Article the <HI>Port</HI> would never grant. To which, as they inform'd me, they return'd this An&s;wer, which inclu|ded good Advice indeed for the &s;ucce&s;s of their own Intere&s;t. <HI>If your Excellency,</HI> &s;aid they, <HI>have po&s;itive In&s;tructions in Re|ference to the Re&s;toration, and that you know the</HI> Port <HI>will never con&s;ent to it, make no other Demand to the</HI> Grand Vizier <HI>till that be concerted; and declare withal to the Prime Mini&s;ter, That you will not Treat, till he has promis'd to re&s;tore us what the</HI> Greeks <HI>have tak'n from us. If your Excellency ob&s;erve this Method, either</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="31">
<HI>the</HI> Vizier <HI>will grant or deny. If he grant, the greate&s;t Impe|diment to the renewing of the Treaty will be remov'd: If he re|fu&s;e, the Rupture will redound to the King of</HI> France<HI>'s Honour. He will appear not to have &s;ought his own Intere&s;t: All</HI> Europe <HI>will admire his Maje&s;ties Piety and Zeal; and there is no Per&s;on but mu&s;t be forc'd to acknowledge that his High Re&s;pect to Re|ligion was the only cau&s;e that incited him to break with the</HI> Turks.</P>
<P>The well-meaning Fathers told me this Story with an extra|ordinary Vehemence, which is u&s;ual among <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monks. For they believ'd it to be one of the mo&s;t Noble Actions in the World to enter into a War with the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, to force the <HI>Great Turk</HI> to take from the Chri&s;tians of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> his own proper Subjects, the Cu&s;tody of five or &s;ix petty Chur|ches, and be&s;tow it upon Foreign Monks, who not content to make u&s;e of 'em when they pleas'd, would have the Keys hung at their Girdles.</P>
<P>About <HI>Mid-May M. de Nointel</HI> finding that the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> and <HI>Vizier</HI> were ready to depart for <HI>Poland,</HI> and that there was but little Progre&s;s made in his Negotiation, went to vi&s;it the <HI>Rei&s;quitab,</HI> or Lord Chancellor: With whom he had three Conferences, before they could conclude the Treaty. But at the third Conference, which was upon the 26th of <HI>May,</HI> all things were agreed and &s;etl'd, and the Alliance was renew'd upon the following Conditions.</P>
<P><HI>That the</HI> French <HI>for the future &s;hould pay no more then Three</HI> per Cent. <HI>Cu&s;toms.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That they &s;hould have the</HI> Red-Sea <HI>open for a Trade into the</HI> Indies, <HI>paying Five</HI> per Cent. <HI>Cu&s;toms, which &s;hould be paid at their Entrance into the</HI> Grand Signior<HI>'s Dominions, without any farther Payments either for their Pa&s;&s;age, or at their Departure.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That the</HI> French <HI>Capuchins &s;hould rebuild their Church of St.</HI> George <HI>at</HI> Galata, <HI>burnt down by Fire: And that the &s;ame Church, together with the Je&s;uits in the &s;ame Place, and all other Appurtenances belonging to the</HI> French <HI>within the</HI> Ottoman <HI>Em|pire, &s;hould be under the Protection of the King.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That the Amba&s;&s;ador &s;hould be acknowledg'd Protector of the Ho&s;pital of the</HI> European <HI>Chri&s;tians in</HI> Galata, <HI>and that they &s;hould have Liberty to &s;ay Ma&s;s in the &s;aid Ho&s;pital.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="31">
<HI>That all the</HI> French <HI>Captives that were in</HI> Turkey, <HI>or &s;hould happen to be taken for the future, &s;hould be &s;et at Liberty, pro|vided they were not taken in any Fleets or Armies, or before any Places in Ho&s;tility with the</HI> Port.</P>
<P>And this was all that was to be chang'd or added in the New Capitulations; for the Article concerning Foreign Nati|ons was to continue as it was before in the former Treaty.</P>
<P>When all things were accepted and mutually agreed, the Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>France</HI>'s elde&s;t Interpreter &s;poke to <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Nointel,</HI> that he &s;hould not &s;tir till the Chancellor had made out a Draught of the New Capitulations. Which advice was well giv'n, but the Amba&s;&s;ador gave more Credit to <HI>Panaioti</HI> the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI>'s Interpreter, who told him, it would be an Affront to the Chancellor, to di&s;tru&s;t what he deliver'd by word of Mouth, by asking him for a Draught in Writing; and that he would engage his Word, and be Security for the performance of what the Chancellor had declar'd. Upon which the Amba&s;&s;ador &s;uffer'd him&s;elf to be over-rul'd; and return'd to his Lodging extreamly joyful and well &s;atisfi'd, and with all the Chearfulne&s;s and Gaiety in his Countenance which generally di&s;plays it &s;elf upon the good &s;ucce&s;s of Bu&s;ine&s;s. In&s;omuch that &s;itting down at Table, <HI>Come, Gentlemen,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>the Capitulations are renew'd; let us now be merry, and drink to this Renovation of the League.</HI></P>
<P>Now the Chancellor had promis'd to &s;end a Copy of the Draught in the Evening, to the end it might be examin'd, and afterward writt'n out fair: but he fail'd in his promi&s;e, nor was the Amba&s;&s;ador troubl'd in the lea&s;t. The next Morn|ing however he &s;ent for it: but he was &s;trangely &s;urpriz'd, to find that the Article about Foreign Nations did not oblige, as it &s;hould have done, all tho&s;e that were under no &s;ettlement already at the <HI>Port,</HI> to put them&s;elves under the Banners and Colours of <HI>France.</HI> Then <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Nointel</HI> began to mi|&s;tru&s;t that he had been deluded. At la&s;t he fell into a Pa&s;&s;ion, and pre&s;ently call'd for his &s;econd Interpreter, to go and tell the Chancellor, That if that Article were not put down as he under&s;tood it, he would not accept the New Capitulations. Which his chief Interpreter ob&s;erving, &s;tepp'd in, and adviz'd him to be wary how he enhanc'd the price as he was going to do; that it was not &s;afe to put the Market into the <HI>Turks</HI> Hands,
<PB N="44" REF="32">
as he did; and therefore de&s;ir'd him to take care how he en|gag'd him&s;elf in a heat to break with the <HI>Port,</HI> for a &s;ingle Ar|ticle of little Importance. But &s;uch was <HI>M de Nointels</HI> Impa|tience, that he bid the Me&s;&s;enger go forthwith, and carry his Me&s;&s;age to the Chancellor; who an&s;wer'd, That he would report it to the <HI>Vizier.</HI></P>
<P>The 29th the Amba&s;&s;ador went to the Chancellor's Hou&s;e; who told him, <Q>That it became not <HI>France</HI> to demand of the <HI>Port</HI> a thing which was not in their Power to grant: For that the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> had engag'd to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> the <HI>Venetians,</HI> the <HI>Hollanders</HI> and <HI>Genoe&s;es,</HI> That all Strangers that &s;hould come into <HI>Turkey,</HI> under their Colours, &s;hould be welcom, whoever they were; &s;hould enjoy the &s;ame Priviledges, and in a word be entertain'd as their Friends were. That having al&s;o granted the &s;ame Priviledges to the Emperor, particularly for the Imperial <HI>Hans-Towns,</HI> for the Subjects of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> and the <HI>Italians,</HI> his Highne&s;s could not without vio|lating his Faith, grant to the <HI>French</HI> what they demanded; that is to &s;ay, That he &s;hould admit no Foreigners but what came under the <HI>French</HI> Colours, unle&s;s they were &s;uch as had their E&s;tabli&s;hments already confirm'd at the <HI>Port.</HI> To which the <HI>Chancellor</HI> added, That what he had repre&s;ented to his Excellency was notoriou&s;ly publick, and a mo&s;t convincing Argument, and therefore be&s;ought him not to in&s;i&s;t any fur|ther upon that Article.</Q> To which <HI>M. de Nointel</HI> reply'd with a Prote&s;t not to renew, unle&s;s that Article were granted in the &s;ame form as he demanded. The <HI>Chancellor</HI> return'd, That he would report his Prote&s;t to the <HI>Vizier,</HI> and then he &s;hould know his An&s;wer. The Amba&s;&s;ador told him, He &s;hould think him&s;elf highly oblig'd, &s;o that his Conveniency would permit him, if he would be pleas'd but to go immediately and &s;peak to the <HI>Vizier,</HI> while he &s;taid for his coming back. The Chancellor con&s;ented; went, &s;poke to the <HI>Vizier,</HI> and re|turn'd with this An&s;wer.</P>
<P><Q>The <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> has order'd me to tell your Excellency, That you made him promi&s;e ye about a Month &s;ince, That provided the <HI>Port</HI> &s;hould grant the Emperor of <HI>France</HI> an Abatement of the Cu&s;toms, and a Free Trade through the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> he would be contented, as to what remain'd, with what was rea&s;onable and ju&s;t. That upon that word he had granted in the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s Name tho&s;e two Articles, and other Favours which you know; but now &s;eeing you have
<PB N="45" REF="32">
not kept your word with him, he declares expre&s;ly, That he recalls his own, and will grant you nothing at all.</Q></P>
<P>This An&s;wer was like a Thunderclap. <HI>M. de Nointel</HI> and tho&s;e that were with him &s;tood like Men in a Trance. They begg'd to re&s;ume, and ratifie the Treaty, but it was impo&s;&s;i|ble, though they proffer'd upon the place to quit and re|nounce the Article conte&s;ted. To which the Chancellor an|&s;wer'd, That he had no other Orders from the <HI>Vizier,</HI> then to deliver his Me&s;&s;age, and that he had no Power to Treat any farther. The Amba&s;&s;ador reply'd; That he had a Letter from the <HI>Prime Mini&s;ter</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> which he de&s;ir'd only to deliver into his Hands, and &s;o to take his leave. The Chan|cellor made An&s;wer, That for his Audience it might be ea&s;ily obtain'd, but as for the Letter from the <HI>Prime Mini&s;ter</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> car'd not a Straw to look upon it.</P>
<P><HI>Mon&s;ieur de Nointel</HI> returning to his Lodging with that vexa|tion and perplexity of Mind which may be conceiv'd with|out any great difficulty, propounded to his Council, which were the Abbot his Brother, the Director of the <HI>Levant Com|pany,</HI> and his two chief Interpreters, That &s;ince the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Hollanders</HI> had lately given Ten Thou&s;and Pounds Ster|ling apiece, for renewing their la&s;t Capitulations, it would be convenient for the <HI>French</HI> to give the &s;ame Money for the renewing of Theirs. Upon which the two Interpreters had order to propo&s;e the Sum to the Chief Mini&s;ters: but it no|thing avail'd. For there are &s;ome Favours obtain'd at the <HI>Port</HI> by the Force of Money; others which no Money will pro|cure. And &s;uch for Example was the Bu&s;ine&s;s &s;ollicited by the two <HI>Commi&s;&s;aries</HI> of the <HI>Holy Land,</HI> who offer'd an Hun|derd Thou&s;and Crowns to the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> to put 'em in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Sacred Places,</HI> and to expend as much in Pre&s;ents to the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> and Mini&s;ters of the <HI>Port.</HI> But their Money was Dro&s;s, the <HI>Divan</HI> not being to be brib'd in that ca&s;e.</P>
<P>By the way, I &s;hall &s;ay this farther, in reference to tho&s;e <HI>Religious Fathers,</HI> that their making &s;uch large Offers was not a thing to be wonder'd at. For they have a&s;&s;ur'd me, that the Devotion which <HI>Spaniards</HI> have toward tho&s;e <HI>Sanctifi'd Places</HI> is &s;o great, that they them&s;elves would expend whole Trea&s;ures for Liberty to enjoy 'em again. They affirm'd to me moreover, That the Money expended in the <HI>Holy Land</HI> amounts to Eight Thou&s;and Pounds Sterling a Year, of which a third part goes in Pre&s;ents to the <HI>Turks;</HI> and that the Guar|dian
<PB N="46" REF="33">
who is Triennial, expends in Pre&s;ents at his Arrival no le&s;s then Two Thou&s;and Five Hunderd Pounds.</P>
<P>The Third of <HI>June,</HI> which was the Day appointed for the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s departure for <HI>Poland,</HI> the Amba&s;&s;ador went be|times in the Morning to the Camp, to the Quarters of the <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> with a de&s;ign to oblige the Haughty Mini&s;ter to grant him that Audience which he had refus'd him ever &s;ince his Arrival, and to receive the Letter from <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Lyonne.</HI> He carry'd with him al&s;o M. <HI>d'Hervieu,</HI> to the end that as he was the Per&s;on that brought it, he &s;hould deliver it into his Hands. But the <HI>Vizier</HI> was not then in the <HI>Camp,</HI> being gone to Convoy the <HI>Sultane&s;s,</HI> Mother to the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> to her fir&s;t Lodging. Which con&s;train'd the Amba&s;&s;ador to go to the Chancellor's Quarters, where he waited &s;even compleat Hours, &s;ometimes in one Tent, &s;ometimes in another, becau&s;e the Camp was then ju&s;t upon Di&s;lodging. At length a little after High Noon, the News came that the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> was come to the City. Whither the Chancellor went to him, and told him, That the Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>France</HI> &s;taid in the Camp to Ki&s;s his Hands, and to know his la&s;t Commands. The <HI>Vi|zier</HI> order'd him to tell his Excellency, That he needed not to give him&s;elf the trouble of waiting, for that he was then ta|king leave of his Wife, his Mother, and his Family, and &s;hould not return to the Camp till Night: and therefore that it would be &s;ufficient for him to leave only one of his Interpreters, to whom he would give his An&s;wer. Which was, <HI>That he would impart the Amba&s;&s;ador's Demands to the</HI> Grand Signior <HI>and the</HI> Divan; <HI>but that he could not do it &s;o &s;oon as he might expect, by rea&s;on that the Army was upon its March. That in the mean time, his Excellency might return to</HI> Con&s;tantinople, <HI>and there await the</HI> Grand Signior<HI>'s Re&s;olution. That he would in the mean time write to the</HI> Caimacan <HI>to grant a Pa&s;s for the King's Ship in the Harbour; and for what remain'd, had it not been but that he confided in the Faith and Honour of the Amba&s;&s;ador, he would have &s;topp'd him at</HI> Adrianople, <HI>to have prevented his departure without leave.</HI></P>
<P>At the &s;ame time the Interpreter had al&s;o Orders to know the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI>'s Commands touching certain particular Af|fairs relating to Trade in &s;everal places of the <HI>Levant.</HI> Which he order'd to be di&s;patch'd the next Morning in manner and form, as the Interpreter de&s;ir'd.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="33">
And this was the Succe&s;s of <HI>M de Nointel</HI>'s &s;econd Journey to the <HI>Port;</HI> upon which both Parties made different Reflecti|ons. For the <HI>Turks</HI> with great a&s;&s;urance lay the blame of this Rupture upon the <HI>French:</HI> Affirming that the Abatement of the Cu&s;toms was not a thing to which the <HI>French</HI> could ju&s;tly pretend. For that if other Nations paid not &s;o much, as the <HI>Engli&s;h, Hollanders,</HI> and <HI>Genoe&s;es,</HI> yet there were &s;ome Nati|ons that paid more, as the <HI>Germans</HI> and <HI>Venetians:</HI> Or if the fir&s;t who paid but Three <HI>per Cent.</HI> had formerly paid Five, then the <HI>French</HI> had had &s;ome rea&s;on to have demanded an Abate|ment. Neverthele&s;s, that the <HI>Port,</HI> who is Free to be&s;tow his Favours where he pleas'd, having Treated upon their Arrival with the la&s;t Comers upon Terms more advantageous then tho&s;e which he granted to his fir&s;t Allies; he was not oblig'd to alter the Conditions of Commerce that had been for &s;o long time concluded. Then for the re&s;t of the Kings Demands, they &s;aid, That they were Favours which could not be in Con|&s;cience demanded; as being &s;uch which the <HI>French</HI> were &s;o far from having de&s;erv'd from the <HI>Port,</HI> that they had always oppos'd him in all his Enterpri&s;es. To which they added, That the <HI>French</HI> had made their Demands, as if they had had the Market in their own Hands, threatning, and acting like Lords and Ma&s;ters, while the <HI>French</HI> that were in the <HI>Levant,</HI> did nothing but talk of Burning <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> making War upon the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> and <HI>Sacking his I&s;lands,</HI> and his <HI>Sea-Ports.</HI> That the Men of War that brought <HI>M. de Nointel</HI> to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> openly protected the e&s;cape of a great number of Slaves of &s;everal &s;orts of Nations, that put them&s;elves aboard. And that the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;adors in all the Vi&s;its which they made to the Great Per&s;onages, di&s;cours'd of no|thing but his Maje&s;ties Conque&s;ts, and the Pui&s;&s;ance of his Arms. This Defence the <HI>Turks</HI> made for them&s;elves. With whom other Nations al&s;o &s;ided, alledging, That the <HI>Turks</HI> were not too blame, as having &s;hew'd them&s;elves upon this Occa&s;ion le&s;s Barbarous then they were &s;aid to be: not having manife&s;ted any thing of violent Re&s;entment either again&s;t the <HI>French</HI> in the <HI>Levant,</HI> or his Maje&s;ties Amba&s;&s;ador, of the nu|merous and powerful Succours which they had many times giv'n their Enemies; of the War which they carry'd on, even in Countries under the <HI>Turks</HI> Protection; or of their Affronts and Menaces not forborn ev'n in the Court it &s;elf. Nor could the&s;e things be otherwi&s;e &s;pok'n then out of an Ardent De&s;ire to &s;ee &s;ome Unlucky Accident happ'n, which might engage
<PB N="48" REF="34">
<HI>France</HI> to imploy again&s;t the <HI>Turks</HI> tho&s;e mighty Preparations of War which the greate&s;t part of her Neighbors dreaded.</P>
<P>And now having thus giv'n an Accompt of the whole Pro|gre&s;s of <HI>M. Nointel</HI>'s Negotiation at the <HI>Port,</HI> I &s;hall add &s;omething in &s;hort in reference to the Negotiations of <HI>M. Wit|zosky,</HI> the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Agent, and Signor <HI>Quirini,</HI> Procurator of <HI>Venice,</HI> of which two the one happen'd to depart as &s;oon as I arriv'd there; but the other remain'd at the Court all the while I &s;taid.</P>
<P>The <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> order'd 1700 Crowns to be giv'n to the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Agent at his departure, for the di&s;charge of his Debts, and his Expences upon the Way; allowing him be&s;ides &s;even Wagons and a <HI>Chiaus.</HI> The <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of <HI>Sili&s;tria</HI> al&s;o had Or|ders to cau&s;e him to be Conducted through the Frontiers of <HI>Tartary;</HI> and to Command the <HI>Tartars</HI> to detain him, till they under&s;tood that the <HI>Turki&s;h Envoy</HI> who was in <HI>Poland,</HI> had pa&s;s'd the <HI>Frontiers,</HI> and was enter'd into <HI>Turkey.</HI> The <HI>Divan</HI> did all they could to compo&s;e all Differences with this <HI>Agent,</HI> and to prevent a War with his Ma&s;ter. For the <HI>Port</HI> had &s;ome De&s;igns upon <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> &s;o that it was only by con&s;traint if they turn'd their Arms again&s;t <HI>Poland.</HI> On the other &s;ide the <HI>Polander</HI> could not brook the Protection which the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> had given to the <HI>Co&s;&s;acks.</HI> For which rea|&s;on the King demanded that his Highne&s;s would publickly re|nounce the Protection which he had publickly allow'd. To the end that the <HI>Co&s;&s;acks</HI> being terrifi'd by &s;uch a De&s;ertion, might be compell'd to &s;ubmit the &s;ooner to the Poli&s;h Prince without Fighting, and he by that means regain the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Ukraine,</HI> which is his particular Demea&s;ns, and the Pa|trimony of his Ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>During the Raign of King <HI>Ca&s;imir, M. Ratzieuskie</HI> was &s;ent to demand the Ratification of the Treaty of <HI>Coctchin,</HI> which was ob&s;erv'd between <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Turkey;</HI> and &s;ome other Things. To which the <HI>Port</HI> made an&s;wer, That they would Ratifie the Treaty purely and barely without mentioning the <HI>Co&s;&s;acks.</HI> But <HI>M. Ratzieuskie</HI> dy'd at <HI>Adrianople</HI> before he could conclude his Negotiation. Who&s;e Imployment of Agent his Secretary, <HI>M. Witzosky</HI> by the Order of the King that &s;uc|ceeded <HI>Ca&s;imir,</HI> was appointed to &s;upply, and receiv'd In&s;tru|ctions to repre&s;ent to the <HI>Port,</HI> That &s;eeing the <HI>Ukraine</HI> was the particular E&s;tate of the Prince who then Raign'd, he had a double Rea&s;on to claim the Repo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. To which the <HI>Port</HI> return'd for an&s;wer, That they would not hinder his
<PB N="49" REF="34">
Maje&s;ty of <HI>Poland</HI> from regaining the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and that he might do what he pleas'd with the <HI>Co&s;&s;acks;</HI> but in regard the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s Honour was concern'd, he could not op'nly di&s;avow the Protection which he had openly granted. But <HI>M. Witzoski,</HI> being a Per&s;on of a violent ha&s;ty Humour, would not accept of that Expedient, nor of any other which the <HI>Turks</HI> propos'd. But loudly prote&s;ted in a full <HI>Divan,</HI><Q> That though the King, the Senat and the Republick &s;hould agree to accept a &s;ingle Ratification, he would prevent 'em from doing it, by the Power which he had, as a Gentleman of <HI>Poland.</HI></Q></P>
<P>But when the King and the Senat under&s;tood that the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> was turning his Preparations again&s;t them; and that mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly the next Spring they &s;hould have him at their Gates, they were both &s;urpriz'd and confounded. Nor did the Agent him&s;elf know what to do, being deceiv'd by the Rumours that were &s;pread abroad of the Revolt of the <HI>Ara|bians,</HI> and Sacking of <HI>Mecca;</HI> as al&s;o for that through the A&s;&s;urances which <HI>M. de Nointel</HI> had giv'n him that his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty would &s;end a Fleet of Fifty Ships into the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> he had always writt'n to the Republick to hold fa&s;t their own, and not to relinqui&s;h the lea&s;t Tittle of their Demands, in regard that infallibly the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> would &s;uddainly have his Hands full on every &s;ide.</P>
<P>And indeed <HI>Poland</HI> was very de&s;irous at that time not to have diverted his Highne&s;s from his <HI>A&s;iatick</HI> De&s;igns. For which rea&s;on, they &s;ent an Interpreter to the <HI>Port.</HI> Who arriv'd the 23 of <HI>May</HI> with a Train of eight Men, &s;ix weeks after the departure of the Agent; and had a Lodging a&s;&s;ign'd him, and Twenty Shillings a day for his Expences. The Letters which he brought were from the Great Chancellor, &s;uper&s;crib'd to the <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> purporting, <Q>That <HI>Poland</HI> was very much &s;urpriz'd to under&s;tand, that the <HI>Grand Sig|nior</HI> was preparing for a War again&s;t them; that they knew not the Rea&s;on, nor had they giv'n him any Occa&s;ion. That if the <HI>Port</HI> would Ratifie the Treaty of <HI>Coctchin,</HI> the King was ready to do it, and would &s;end an Amba&s;&s;ador Ex|traordinary for that purpo&s;e. But that if the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> per&s;i&s;ted in his De&s;ign of making War, his Maje&s;ty was rea|dy to defend him&s;elf; prote&s;ting withal that the <HI>Polanders</HI> were not the Violators of the Peace.</Q> The Interpreter was di&s;patch'd and &s;ent back again in eight days, with Letters to this effect, That <HI>Poland</HI> might &s;end an Amba&s;&s;ador Extraor|dinary,

<P>In the Negotiation of the Signor <HI>Quirini</HI> there was no|thing particularly ob&s;ervable. Only he had peculiar In&s;tructi|ons to pre&s;s the relea&s;e of &s;uch Pris'ners as had been tak'n in the War of <HI>Candy:</HI> but after great Pains and va&s;t Expences he could obtain no more then an Exchange of Eight and Twenty of the Principal for as many of the <HI>Turks.</HI> Which Exchange was made at <HI>Ca&s;tello Torne&s;e</HI> in the <HI>Morea.</HI> As for the re&s;t of the Pris'ners to the Number of a Thou&s;and or thereabouts, the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> told the <HI>Procurator</HI> of <HI>Venice,</HI> That the <HI>Otto|man</HI> Galleys were de&s;titute of Slaves, and therefore to relea&s;e a Thou&s;and at one Clap, would weak'n 'em too much; e&s;pe|cially at a time when they had &s;o much need of Rowers to carry Men and Ammunition through the <HI>Black-Sea</HI> for &s;upply of their Army in <HI>Poland.</HI> However he promis'd that when the <HI>Campaigne</HI> was at an end, he would order Two Hunderd and Fifty to be releas'd; and &s;o the like Number every year till they were all at Liberty.</P>
<P>The <HI>Venetians</HI> are at that va&s;t Expence at the <HI>Port,</HI> that it may be truly &s;aid they buy whatever they obtain, and that at a dear rate too There is no Per&s;on of Credit either in the Court or the <HI>Divan,</HI> to whom they do not make con&s;ide|rable Pre&s;ents every year. For the <HI>Republick,</HI> that has no Neighbor to be afraid of, but the <HI>Turk,</HI> &s;pares for no Co&s;t to be at peace with him. They pay him Tribute, out of &s;e|veral I&s;lands in the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> as <HI>Zant,</HI> and <HI>Cerigo.</HI> They connive at his Humours, his Affronts, his Tyranny; and all to prevent Quarrels and Wars that ari&s;e every day between Po|tent Neighbors, as much as may be done by the Prudence of their Conduct: and the &s;ame <HI>Republick</HI> &s;ends for her Am|ba&s;&s;adors to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> the Anciente&s;t, and mo&s;t Experi|enc'd of her Senators. The <HI>Procurators</HI> al&s;o of <HI>Venice</HI> are u&s;u|ally &s;uch as have been Amba&s;&s;adors in all the Courts of <HI>Chri|&s;tendom,</HI> and which have been employ'd in Treaties of Peace and War, and all other Negotiations. Per&s;ons in a word that under&s;tand all the Politicks of all the Princes of the World, and the Slights of the mo&s;t Crafty Mini&s;ters of State, in the Art of concealing their own, and di&s;covering the Thoughts of others. The&s;e <HI>Procurators</HI> are fully Commi&s;&s;ion'd to expend and give whatever they deem requi&s;ite. Generally they re|&s;ide three years at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> during which time they pick

up above an Hunderd Thou&s;and Crowns; or at lea&s;t it is in their power &s;o to do; for the <HI>Republick</HI> never calls 'em to Accompt. And this they do for two Rea&s;ons; the fir&s;t is, to balance by their Gains the Trouble and Hard&s;hip of an Em|ba&s;&s;ie to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> which ari&s;e from the Danger and Toil of Travailing; and from the ill Humour and Contempt of the <HI>Turks.</HI> And &s;econdly, to recompence tho&s;e <HI>Procurators,</HI> who have wa&s;ted their E&s;tates in <HI>European</HI> Amba&s;&s;ies.</P>
<P>I have heard <HI>M. Quirini</HI> affirm, at &s;everal times that I have had the Honour to vi&s;it him, That the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Policy did ve|ry much &s;urpa&s;s that of the <HI>Europeans:</HI> That it was not con|fin'd within Maxims and Rules; but con&s;i&s;ted altogether in Sen&s;e and Judgment, as being grounded altogether upon Rea|&s;on, and never acting but according to Rea&s;on. Which &s;ort of Policy, having neither Art nor Principles, was as it were unapproachable; in&s;omuch that he &s;eriou&s;ly acknowledg'd, That the Conduct of a <HI>Vizier,</HI> was to him an Aby&s;s, of which he could not Fadom the Judgment, the Fore&s;ight, the Per|&s;picacy, the Secrecy, the Cunning, with all its Windings and Labyrinths. He a&s;&s;ur'd me, That if had a Son, he would &s;end him to no other School then to the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Court; where he could not too highly admire the <HI>Vizier,</HI> who without &s;peak|ing, writing, or &s;o much as moving him&s;elf, Govern'd one of the mo&s;t Potent Empires of the World, and had extended the Limits of it in &s;everal places.</P>
<P>During my &s;tay at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> I had the Honour &s;everal times to conver&s;e with this <HI>Venetian</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador; and becau&s;e that then our mo&s;t general di&s;cour&s;e was concerning the War of <HI>Candy,</HI> I learnt from him and &s;everal other Eminent Per|&s;onages of the Court, divers Particulars worthy Ob&s;erva|tion; of which I &s;hall here &s;et down the mo&s;t Memo|rable.</P>
<P>One of the Principal Performances which the Law of <HI>Ma|homet</HI> enjoyns, is the Pilgrimage to <HI>Mecca</HI> and <HI>Medina.</HI> There is nothing that can legally di&s;pence with it but an extream Po|verty: and it further lays a &s;trict Injunction upon tho&s;e whom either Sickne&s;s, or Imployment, or other Occa&s;ions will not permit to go in Per&s;on, to make their Pilgrimage by Proxy; that is, to &s;end to tho&s;e Places of Devotion, a Per&s;on on pur|po&s;e, to perform all tho&s;e Duties which he him&s;elf ought to have done, could he have gone thither him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="36">
The <HI>Ottoman</HI> Emperors are very punctual in the Di&s;charge of this Duty, as well for them&s;elves, as for their whole Fa|milies. They &s;end every year Con&s;iderable Pre&s;ents to tho&s;e Cities, of which they e&s;teem it a High Honour to call them|&s;elves the <HI>Lords</HI> and <HI>Protectors:</HI> and the&s;e Pre&s;ents are &s;ent &s;ometimes by Land, and &s;ometimes by Sea. In the year 1644. they were put aboard a great Gallion, which was to carry 'em to <HI>Cairo.</HI> Several Eunuchs and Women of the <HI>Serraglio</HI> were embark'd in the &s;ame Ve&s;&s;el, together with the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s Delegates, and a great Number of Pa&s;&s;engers and Souldiers. This Ve&s;&s;el putting to Sea from <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> with &s;everal other Ve&s;&s;els under her <HI>Convoy,</HI> was &s;et upon not far from <HI>Rhodes</HI> by the Galleys of <HI>Malta,</HI> and after a fierce Engagement taken. Neverthele&s;s the Galleys could not carry her off to <HI>Malta,</HI> by rea&s;on that &s;he leak'd in &s;everal places, as having receiv'd &s;everal Shot in the Fight; &s;o that they were forc'd to carry her into a Port of the I&s;land of <HI>Candy.</HI> Where they &s;topp'd her Leaks the be&s;t they could, and took all the care imaginable to have carry'd her Home, but all to no pur|po&s;e; for &s;he &s;unk by the way. However the <HI>Cargo</HI> which they unladed into their Galleys was valu'd at a Million of Money.</P>
<P>The News of the taking this <HI>Gallion</HI> put the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> into a Rage: in&s;omuch that he threaten'd to exterminate all the Chri&s;tians that were in <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> as well Amba&s;&s;a|dors and Foreign Mini&s;ters, as others. And he thus menac'd all &s;orts of Nations, becau&s;e, &s;aid he, the Galleys of <HI>Malta</HI> were Mann'd with <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> and Souldiers from all parts of <HI>Chri&s;tendom.</HI></P>
<P><HI>M. Soranzo,</HI> the <HI>Venetian</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador at the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Court, pre&s;ently addre&s;s'd him&s;elf to the Mini&s;ters of the <HI>Divan.</HI> For he was in great hopes to divert the Storm from falling upon his Head, and to appea&s;e the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> by giving him to un|der&s;tand, that there was not any one Subject of the <HI>Republick</HI> who was a Knight of <HI>Malta.</HI> The Amba&s;&s;adors of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> made the &s;ame Remon&s;trances. So that in all probability the Tempe&s;t was like to fall upon <HI>M. de la Haye</HI> the Father, then Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>France.</HI> And que&s;tionle&s;s he had &s;everely felt the Barbarou&s;ne&s;s of the <HI>Turks,</HI> and the Fury of the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> if <HI>Givan Capigi Bachi</HI> the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> had not Warded off the Blow. Who being a Per&s;on of great Wit, of &s;ingular Worth, and Illu&s;trious for his De&s;cent in <HI>Turkey,</HI> as being de&s;cended from a Family famous for Six <HI>Grand</HI>
<PB N="53" REF="36">
<HI>Viziers,</HI> took upon him to &s;ecure the Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>France,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> and all the Chri&s;tians that were at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> except the <HI>Venetians.</HI> He gave his Highne&s;s to under&s;tand that the <HI>Venetians</HI> were the mo&s;t guilty, for having permitted the Galleys of <HI>Malta</HI> to bring in the Gallion into their Har|bours, and not &s;ecuring it. By which means he turn'd all the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s Wrath upon <HI>Candy,</HI> who thereupon determin'd to make that the Seat of his War. But this Re&s;olution of his was privately carry'd, and the better to conceal his De&s;ign, he di&s;play'd his intended Revenge only again&s;t <HI>Malta.</HI> To which purpo&s;e he proclaim'd open War again&s;t that little I&s;land, and order'd all his Forces to be in a readine&s;s by the end of <HI>March</HI> 1645.</P>
<P>The Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>Venice</HI> &s;par'd neither Indu&s;try nor Pre|&s;ents to penetrate the Truth of this De&s;ign, whether it were real, or only a Trick to cover &s;ome Enterprize again&s;t the <HI>Republick.</HI> On the other &s;ide, the Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>France</HI> a&s;|&s;ur'd him, that it was only a di&s;&s;embl'd Pretence, and that the true De&s;ign was upon <HI>Candy.</HI> But he gave no heed to his Intelligence, &s;uffering him&s;elf to be deluded by the A&s;&s;u|rances which the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> gave him from time to time to the contrary.</P>
<P>But toward the end of <HI>April</HI> the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Fleet con&s;i&s;ting of Four&s;core Ships and as many Galleys, under the Command of <HI>I&s;&s;ouf Captain Ba&s;ha,</HI> putting to Sea from <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> Landed in <HI>Candy,</HI> and in Ten Days took <HI>Canea.</HI> They who were acquainted with that &s;ame General, affirm'd him to be a great Commander, and that he would have Conquer'd the I&s;land in a &s;mall time, had he not been depriv'd of his Life and the Conduct of the War. For the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> being put i' th' Head that <HI>I&s;&s;ouf</HI> had Va&s;t Trea&s;ures; and that he could Conquer the re&s;t of <HI>Candy</HI> without his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, caus'd him to be &s;trangl'd at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> &s;ome few days after his return. However his Highne&s;s had not only a great lo&s;s by his Death, but mi&s;s'd of the Trea&s;ures which he expected. In the following Years he &s;ent other Armies into <HI>Candy</HI> under different Generals: and for the Succe&s;s which they had, it is too well known, to &s;peak more of it in this place.</P>
<P>For it was neither to the Strength of the I&s;land, nor the Weakne&s;s of the <HI>Turks,</HI> that we are to a&s;cribe the length of that War, which la&s;ted Four and Twenty Years; but to the &s;trange Revolutions that happen'd in the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Court almo&s;t at the beginning of that Enterprize; and to the Wars of
<PB N="54" REF="37">
<HI>Tran&s;ylvania</HI> and <HI>Hungary</HI> that la&s;ted till the Year 1665. But the Prince who undertook the Conque&s;t of <HI>Candy</HI> was <HI>Ibrahim,</HI> then about Two and Thirty Years of Age, who was advanc'd to the Empire Four Years before, contrary to his own and the Expectation of all the World. For he had been kept in a clo&s;e Impri&s;onment during the Raign of <HI>O&s;man,</HI> and <HI>Murat</HI> his Brothers; the latter of which, after he had caus'd his two younger Brothers to be &s;trangl'd, when he &s;aw him&s;elf near his End, commanded al&s;o that <HI>Ibrahim</HI> &s;hould be &s;trangl'd, who was the only Brother that remain'd. However this Ri|gorous Command was not put in Execution, for that <HI>Amureth</HI> not having any Children, <HI>Ibrahim</HI> that was the only Remainder of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Family, was al&s;o Heir of the Empire. By the way we are to ob&s;erve, that the rea&s;on which induc'd <HI>Amu|rat</HI> to let <HI>Ibrahim</HI> alone, and put his two other Brothers to death, though much younger, was his want of Wit, which rendring him unfit for Government, &s;ecur'd him from any fear of a Rebellion for his &s;ake. So &s;oon as he came to the Throne, he plung'd him&s;elf into all manner of Vice and Wick|edne&s;s. His Debaucheries, his Extortions, and his Cruelties renderd him Odious and in&s;upportable to all his Subjects. He &s;eiz'd upon the Revenues of the Mo&s;quees, and private Mens E&s;tates, without any di&s;tinction of Sacred or Prophane, and frequently put to death &s;uch as he thought to be Rich, to the end he might with more ea&s;e make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of their E&s;tates, and all this to &s;upply the inordinate Expences of his Plea&s;ures, and the exce&s;&s;ive Luxury of his Court. The Soul|diers were ill paid; which caus'd 'em to mutiny, with a Re|&s;olution to depo&s;e <HI>Ibrahim</HI> in the Month of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1648 and to &s;et upon the Throne <HI>Mahamed</HI> his Elde&s;t Son, about &s;even Years of Age; &s;o that twelve Days after they &s;trangl'd <HI>Ibra|him.</HI></P>
<P>I have already related, how that in the Minority of <HI>Ma|hamed,</HI> the Empire was Govern'd by VVomen and Eunuchs, who fill'd all the chief Places of Tru&s;t, as they thought good them&s;elves, and particularly that of the Prime Mini&s;ter, till they gave it to <HI>Cuperly Mahomet</HI> who undertook the VVar of <HI>Tran&s;ylvania.</HI> His Succe&s;&s;or, who was his Son, began that of <HI>Hungary,</HI> which being ended by the Peace in the Year 1665. as already has been &s;aid, for the next two Years he clo&s;ely pur&s;u'd the War of <HI>Candy,</HI> where he found a longer and more vigorous Re&s;i&s;tance then he expected.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="37">
Had <HI>Candy</HI> held out another Winter again&s;t the <HI>Turks,</HI> 'tis not to be que&s;tion'd, but that the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> mu&s;t have been forc'd to rai&s;e his Siege, and then &s;trange Commotions would have happen'd in the Empire. The Veterane Janizaries were all either &s;lain or dead in the Siege: The re&s;t would not budge a foot. The <HI>Turks</HI> murmur'd at the War; and cry'd out that the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Forces were commanded to da&s;h out their Brains again&s;t a Rock: The People of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> were for advancing the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s Brother to the Throne. His Highne&s;s was &s;ollicited to put the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> to death by means of &s;uch a Sacrifice to appea&s;e the Fury of the People and Souldiery. Both the one and the other of the&s;e Changes had been &s;ufficient to have rais'd the Siege.</P>
<P>The <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> knew all this. So that he de&s;pair'd of putting an end to the War: di&s;mally afraid at once to lo&s;e both his Honour and his Life. It is reported that he tore his very Hair from his Chin. However it is mo&s;t certain that it brought upon him a mo&s;t Incurable Di&s;temper, difficult to be nam'd. It was an odd kind of &s;eizure of the Heart, or faint|ing of the Spirits, caus'd by Fear, Affliction and Pannick Ter|rour. For which the Phy&s;itians pre&s;crib'd him to drink pure Wine without any Mixture; which he did every day; nor could any thing but that do him any good.</P>
<P>When the News of the Surrender of <HI>Candy</HI> was brought to the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> his Highne&s;s could not believe it; but when the Tydings were confirm'd, it tran&s;ported him to &s;uch an Exce&s;s of Joy, that rather &s;eem'd to be a &s;ort of Frenzy for the time. And both He and the whole Court frequently re|peated the&s;e words, <HI>The</HI> Franks <HI>have had pity upon &V;s.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> boa&s;ted upon the taking of <HI>Candy,</HI> That they had Conquer'd all <HI>Chri&s;tendom.</HI> Becau&s;e the Town had been defended by Soldiers and Volunteers from all parts of <HI>Chri&s;ten|dom;</HI> and they &s;aid moreover, That the Siege had la&s;ted three Years, for that all <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> had been there, and done the utmo&s;t of their Endeavours.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t u&s;eful and provident Preparation which the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> made for the Siege, was to make his <HI>Kiaia,</HI> or Steward of his Hou&s;hold, High Trea&s;urer of the Empire. For he knew the Love and Friend&s;hip which that Lord had for him, and that for a need he would not &s;pare his Life to do him Service. And this &s;ame Fore&s;ight of his was the gaining of the Place, and the &s;afeguard of his own Life. For the High Trea&s;urer would not &s;uffer any want to be in the Camp. Sheep were
<PB N="56" REF="38">
there in great plenty at a Crown apiece. The Markets were &s;tor'd with all Things nece&s;&s;ary for Food and Raiment. And Men car'd not what they gave, or what Ri&s;co's they ventur'd, to carry Ammunition to a Place where Money abounded.</P>
<P>By the Accompts which the Trea&s;urer brought into the <HI>Di|van</HI> of the Extraordinary Expences at <HI>Candy</HI> the three la&s;t Years of the Siege, it appear'd that Seven Hunderd Thou&s;and Crowns had been &s;pent in Gifts to <HI>Renegado</HI>'s that turn'd <HI>Turks,</HI> or left the I&s;land, to recompence &s;uch Souldiers as had behav'd them&s;elves more bravely then others; and to pay the Prizes &s;et upon the Chri&s;tians Heads; which was half a Guinea for every Head. By that Accompt it appear'd that the <HI>Turks</HI> had made an Hunderd Thou&s;and Shot with their great Guns again&s;t the Place; and that there had been &s;lain before the Place Se|ven <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI>'s, Four&s;core Captains and Colonels, 10400 Jani|&s;aries, be&s;ides other Souldiers and Troops of the Provinces, who&s;e Pay is not charg'd to the State.</P>
<P>The Day that the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> enter'd <HI>Candy,</HI> Signor <HI>Molino,</HI> who was &s;ent by the <HI>Republick</HI> to make a Peace with the <HI>Port,</HI> Riding a' one &s;ide of him, the <HI>Grand Vi|zier</HI> told him, That the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> had paid dear for the <HI>I&s;land of Candy.</HI> To whom <HI>Molino</HI> reply'd, That it had co&s;t the <HI>Republick</HI> as much; no le&s;s then the Lives of a Hunderd Thou&s;and Men, without reck'ning the <HI>French.</HI> The <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> ask'd him, VVhy the Place was not &s;urrender'd &s;ooner, in regard they had been but in a bad Condition a long time to hold it out. To whom the Amba&s;&s;ador made an&s;wer, That the King of <HI>France</HI> had hinder'd the Surrender, by his Pro|mi&s;es of Powerful A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and to declare a VVar again&s;t the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>The Procurator <HI>Molino</HI> arriv'd in <HI>Candy</HI> in the Spring of the Year 1669. and lay at a place call'd <HI>Gozi,</HI> not far from the I&s;land. From whence he &s;ent to offer the <HI>Grabu&s;i, Spina Longa, Suda,</HI> and <HI>Tine</HI> I&s;lands of the <HI>Archipelago; Cli&s;&s;a</HI> and other Places upon the Continent, the whole Expences of the VVar, and an Annual Tribute of Fifty Thou&s;and Crowns a Year for the City of <HI>Candy,</HI> &s;o that the <HI>Republick</HI> might keep the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. To which the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> return'd for an&s;wer, That the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> valu'd his Honour at a Higher Rate, then all the VVorld be&s;ide; and therefore he would only have that Bit of a Rock, which his Highne&s;s had been la|bouring for above the&s;e Four and Twenty Years.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="38">
But it was <HI>Captain General Moro&s;ini</HI> who made the Truce with the <HI>Vizier;</HI> which he did without <HI>Molino</HI>'s knowledge, or imparting to him the lea&s;t Tittle concerning it. Which Tran&s;action of his had like to have co&s;t <HI>Moro&s;ini</HI> his Life at <HI>Venice,</HI> but the large Sums of Money which he paid in one Night, deliver'd him from his Fears: For this General minded no other Intere&s;t in Treating but the Publick Welfare. He nei|ther troubl'd him&s;elf about Religion or Trade: But wholly apply'd him&s;elf to what concern'd the I&s;land of <HI>Candy,</HI> and the War, and agreed with the <HI>Vizier,</HI> that all other Things &s;hould remain in the &s;ame Condition as before the Rupture. Which was the rea&s;on that <HI>Signor Molino</HI> found it &s;o difficult to rebuild at <HI>Galata,</HI> part of the Suburbs of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> the <HI>Venetian Church,</HI> that had been burnt down; and labour'd &s;o &s;edulou&s;ly to remove the Ob&s;tacles which he met with on every &s;ide, that he dy'd in the mid&s;t of all his Toyl: but by Good-Luck the Work was almo&s;t fini&s;h'd. He requir'd &s;eve|ral other Things of the <HI>Grand Signior;</HI> as the Abatement of the Cu&s;toms, which the <HI>Venetians</HI> paid; but could not obtain it. For, &s;aid the <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> <Q><HI>Signor Molino,</HI> The Alliance be|tween the <HI>Port</HI> and the <HI>Republick</HI> is an Ancient Alliance, and the <HI>Port</HI> values it for its Antiquity. If you change &s;ome of the Articles, the Alliance will be a new one, for which the <HI>Turks</HI> will never have that high e&s;teem. Be&s;ides, if you require Favours of the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> he will demand &s;ome|thing more of you.</Q> <HI>Signor Molino</HI> under&s;tood well enough what he meant, which was the Rea&s;on he &s;pake not a word more of the Abatement of the Cu&s;toms, nor of changing the Ancient Capitulations.</P>
<P>And thus I have giv'n a fair Idea of the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI>'s Con|duct, not to &s;ay any more in particular concerning his Per&s;on. But in regard it was to his Father, who was al&s;o <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> that he was beholding to for his Fortune and his Honour, I &s;hall in the fir&s;t place, and in few words, give an Accompt of the mo&s;t Remarkable Atchievements of that Renowned <HI>Vizier.</HI></P>
<P>He was call'd <HI>Cuperly Mahamed Ba&s;ha,</HI> rais'd to that High Dignity by the Fanta&s;tick Humour of the Women and Eu|nuchs, who Govern'd during the Minority of <HI>Mahamed</HI> the Fourth. Before his Advancement, it was that which he lea&s;t dreamt of; but when he was Inve&s;ted in his Imployment,
<PB N="58" REF="39">
he began to con&s;ider the frequent Changes of the <HI>Grand Vi|ziers</HI> his Predece&s;&s;ors almo&s;t every three Months, and there|fore for the Pre&s;ervation of his Life and Dignity, he thought it his be&s;t way to put to Death his Envyers and Competitors, and to &s;et new Wars afoot, on purpo&s;e to remove the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> from <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and to keep him&s;elf &s;till at the Head of an Army</P>
<P>He began with the <HI>Serraglio,</HI> where he caus'd &s;everal Eu|nuchs to be &s;trangl'd; and having in a little time made him|&s;elf Ma&s;ter of the Credulity and Affections of the Young Prince, he per&s;waded him, that to make him&s;elf Ab&s;olute Soveraign of the Empire, to free him&s;elf from the Fears of Tumult and Sedition, and prevent the Souldiery from making the &s;ame Attempts upon him as they had done upon his Fa|ther, the be&s;t way would be for his Highne&s;s to remove from the Capital City, where the People were Mutinous, and the Janizaries were Ma&s;ters, and that he &s;hould rid him&s;elf of all tho&s;e Per&s;ons that had depos'd his Father, and dipp'd their Parricide Hands in his Blood. In pur&s;uance of this Project, <HI>Cuperly</HI> caus'd <HI>Dely U&s;&s;ein Pa&s;ha</HI> to be &s;trangl'd, who had been General at <HI>Candy,</HI> and was accompted the mo&s;t Famous and Valiant Captain of the Empire. Then he remov'd the Court to <HI>Adrianople,</HI> and began the <HI>Tran&s;ylvanian</HI> War, in re|gard the War in <HI>Candy</HI> would have call'd him too far from the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s Per&s;on, not being as yet of Age to March at the Head of his own Armies.</P>
<P>This <HI>Tran&s;ylvanian</HI> War was &s;hort, and honourable for the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> by the defeat of Prince <HI>Ragotsky,</HI> and by the taking of <HI>Waradin,</HI> though it co&s;t him the Blood of the choice&s;t <HI>Ottoman</HI> Troops, and the brave&s;t of their Officers. He return'd Victorious to <HI>Adrianople,</HI> and though he had made a Peace with the Emperour, yet he &s;et him&s;elf to make preparation for a new War again&s;t him in <HI>Hungary.</HI> But be|ing ready to take the Field in the Year 1662. he dy'd; yet &s;o prevalent at Court as to obtain his only Son <HI>Achmet Pa&s;ha</HI> to be admitted into his Place, though at that time he had &s;carcely attain'd to Thirty Years of Age, which was a Thing altogether extraordinary, and not to be parallell'd in the Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Monarchy.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="39">
'Tis a que&s;tion whether ever there were a <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> more capable to Govern the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, then <HI>Achmet Pacha.</HI> He was very tall, and &s;omewhat full and plump of Body. His Eyes large and wide: His Face well &s;hap'd; his Complexion Fair and Smooth: The Air of his Face Mode&s;t, Grave, Affable, and Obliging. He was no Tyrant, mor|tally hating Oppre&s;&s;ion, Ju&s;tice and Equity appear'd in all his Actions, nor did he &s;uffer him&s;elf to be &s;way'd by his own In|tere&s;t. For whether it were that he did not give his Mind to thir&s;t after Riches, or whether it were that his own E&s;tate which was very Great, &s;atisfi'd his de&s;ires, he was never known to be Covetous like the re&s;t of the <HI>Turks:</HI> And this is particularly &s;aid of him, very much to his Honor, that of all the Per&s;ons, that addre&s;s'd them&s;elves to him with Pre&s;ents, to accompli&s;h their Ends, not any obtain'd 'em by that means. His Wit was of a large extent, penetrating and re&s;erv'd: His Me|mory happy and prompt: His Judgment &s;ound, and always well apply'd: For he &s;till fell directly upon the Point. He &s;poke little and Mode&s;tly, but with that Solidity and Knowledge which it is not ea&s;ie to de&s;cribe. The Fir&s;t Years of his Mi|ni&s;try were very Honourable and Advantageous to the <HI>Otto|man</HI> Empire, and his following Atchievements much more.</P>
<P>This Great Per&s;onage therefore having ob&s;erv'd the Happy &s;ucce&s;s of his Father in the Government of <HI>Turkey,</HI> labour'd to follow his example and tread his Steps as near as he could. He began the War again&s;t the <HI>Emperor</HI> which his Father had projected, and was about to have undertak'n. To which purpo&s;e he march'd to <HI>Buda,</HI> with an Army of Three&s;core Thou&s;and Men, and be&s;ieg'd <HI>Neuhau&s;el,</HI> which he took in the Year 1663. He rais'd the Siege of <HI>Cani&s;ia,</HI> and carry'd the Fort <HI>Serini</HI> toward the beginning of the next Year. And de|&s;igning a farther Progre&s;s of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Armies even to the Walls of <HI>Vienna,</HI> he caus'd a Bridge to be lay'd over the Ri|ver <HI>Raab:</HI> Over which Twelve Thou&s;ands <HI>Turks</HI> had already pa&s;s'd; and all the re&s;t of the Army was about to have follow'd, had they not been prevented by the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s Forces, who be|ing reinforc'd with the Succors of the <HI>Allies</HI> of the Empire, and particularly the <HI>French,</HI> cut to pieces the greate&s;t part of the Twelve Thou&s;and <HI>Turks,</HI> put the re&s;t to flight, and gain'd that Famous Battel, call'd the Battel of <HI>St. Godard,</HI> from the Name of the Village where it was fought.</P>
<P>The <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> repair'd the lo&s;s of that Battel by a Trea|ty of Peace as Honourable and as Advantageous as if he had
<PB N="60" REF="40">
gain'd the Victory; and perceiving the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s earne&s;t de&s;ire to return to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> carry'd him thither &s;o well guarded, that there was no Commotion to be fear'd; where be &s;tay'd till the beginning of the Year 1666. At what time he undertook the War of <HI>Candy,</HI> in which he &s;pent Three Years, as has been already &s;aid. Two Years after he began the War of <HI>Poland;</HI> ob&s;erving always his Fathers Great Maxim, <HI>That it behov'd a Prime Vizier &s;till to keep him&s;elf at the Head of an Army.</HI></P>
<P>We departed from <HI>Andrianople</HI> the 9th of <HI>June,</HI> and return'd to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> the 15th. The 17th by Break of Day <HI>M. de Nointel</HI> went <HI>incognito</HI> to vi&s;it the <HI>Caimacan</HI> and to demand a Pa&s;&s;port for the Kings Ship. The <HI>Caimacan</HI> return'd for an&s;wer, that he had receiv'd no Orders from the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> to give him one, and therefore could not do it. At which the Amba&s;|&s;ador was very much &s;urpriz'd, and as highly concern'd; and thereupon complain'd to the <HI>Caimacan</HI> of the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI>'s un|kindne&s;s toward him. Upon which the <HI>Caimacan</HI> made a &s;hew of taking his Part, and being concern'd for the Unju&s;tice done the Amba&s;&s;ador; and then concluded with his Excellency, that they would &s;end a particular Me&s;&s;enger and Letter's to the <HI>Prime Vizier.</HI> As for the <HI>Caimacan,</HI> he fail'd not to &s;end, on his part, to the <HI>Vizier</HI> an accompt of all that the Amba&s;&s;a|dor had told him, and repre&s;ented to him by way of Com|plaint. On the other &s;ide <HI>M. de Nointel</HI> in his Letters tax'd the <HI>Vizier</HI> of Breach of his Word. He conjur'd him not to injure his Patience, which he had now contain'd as long as he could; to let him know the Final Re&s;olution of the Port, and particularly to &s;end him Order for a Pa&s;s for the Kings Ship.</P>
<P>The Expre&s;&s;es that carry'd the&s;e Letters &s;et forth at &s;everal times. The <HI>Caimacan</HI>'s Me&s;&s;enger departed the 18th of <HI>June,</HI> and the <HI>M. de Nointel</HI>'s the next Day. The <HI>Caimacan</HI>'s Me&s;|&s;enger found the Court not far from <HI>Sili&s;tria</HI> from whence he return'd to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> the Ninth of <HI>July.</HI> So &s;oon as he ar|riv'd, his Ma&s;ter &s;ent for the Amba&s;&s;adors Chief Interpreter and told him, that the <HI>Vizier</HI> had given no an&s;wer to his Expre&s;s; only had &s;ent him word that he would let him un|der&s;tand the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s Plea&s;ure by another way. The Amba&s;&s;adors <HI>Courrier</HI> was not return'd the 20th of <HI>July,</HI> when I left the City; and therefore I know not what an&s;wer he brought.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="40">
At the end of <HI>June</HI> the Amba&s;&s;ador &s;ent for a Pa&s;s for the Director of the <HI>Levant Company,</HI> and for my &s;elf; a Licen&s;e to bring in a Parcel of Wine, and another to be admitted into the <HI>Santa Sophia.</HI> To which the <HI>Caimacan</HI> return'd for An&s;wer, That he could not grant any one of the Amba&s;&s;a|dor's Demands, until he fir&s;t knew the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI>'s Mind: That it very much troubl'd him to refu&s;e him &s;uch Trifles; but con&s;idering how Things &s;tood between the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> and the Amba&s;&s;ador, he &s;hould make him&s;elf a Publick Of|fender to grant Pa&s;&s;es to his Excellency: but that &s;o &s;oon as he had leave, his Excellency &s;hould find the great Affection which he had for the <HI>French</HI> Nation.</P>
<P>This Refu&s;al troubl'd me extreamly; for that it &s;eem'd to confirm the Report, which ran about, That the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> intended to Arre&s;t the Amba&s;&s;ador and all the <HI>French</HI> Nation. I found I had a large Stock of Goods; as much as two Hor&s;es could carry, as I have &s;aid before. My Comrades Baggage and my own was as much as would load four Hor&s;es more. So that it was to no purpo&s;e to think of e&s;caping by Flight, much le&s;s of concealing our &s;elves. Be&s;ides this, three other Con&s;iderations very much augmented my cares and my per|plexity. The fir&s;t was, That what&s;oever way I took to get into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> I could not get out of <HI>Turkey</HI> in three Months&punc; during which time the <HI>Port</HI> would have time enough to &s;end their Orders to the utmo&s;t Limits of the Empire to &s;top the <HI>French,</HI> if they de&s;ign'd any &s;uch violent proceedings again&s;t 'em. The &s;econd was, That nothing of all that I carry'd of great|e&s;t Value, had paid at the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e, &s;o that if I happen'd to be &s;earch'd either at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> or any other Cities of <HI>Turkey,</HI> I could not expect any A&s;&s;i&s;tance from the Amba&s;&s;a|dor. The third was, That becau&s;e of the Heat of the Wea|ther, there was no Caravan that travell'd into <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> till <HI>Octo|ber.</HI></P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of this Intricate Perplexity, <HI>GOD,</HI> who&s;e In|finite Favour I have always experienc'd in my mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing Nece&s;&s;ities, &s;hew'd me a ready way to make my e&s;cape from <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> The <HI>Grand Signior</HI> has a Fortre&s;s about Twen|ty Miles from the River <HI>Tanais,</HI> over again&s;t that part where the great River di&s;charges it &s;elf into the Lake <HI>Maeotis;</HI> which Fort is call'd <HI>Azac.</HI> The <HI>Port</HI> &s;ends thither every Year a New Commander with Souldiers and Money: and they &s;end by Sea, becau&s;e it is not above 1300 Miles by Water; and to avoid the Hazards by Land for fear of the <HI>Tartars, Co&s;&s;aques</HI>
<PB N="62" REF="41">
and <HI>Mu&s;covites.</HI> Moreover, the <HI>Saique</HI> which is a &s;ort of <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;el that takes the Commander aboard, is not ex|pos'd to the &s;earch of the Cu&s;tomers, as are the re&s;t of the Ships that Sail into the <HI>Black-Sea.</HI> That which is aboard may be &s;aid to be free, there being none but the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Com|mander that has any Authority to take Cognizance of it. This <HI>Saique</HI> touches at <HI>Caffa,</HI> which is a City and famous <HI>Port</HI> in the <HI>Crimoean Tartary.</HI> Whence all the Ve&s;&s;els that are bound for <HI>Mingrelia</HI> or <HI>Colchis</HI> put to Sea in the Months of <HI>September</HI> and <HI>October,</HI> from whence it is not above &s;even or eight days Journey before ye enter into the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Dominions. There is no &s;horter way from <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> to <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> nor le&s;s trou|ble&s;om. For the whole Voyage may be made in three Weeks, all by Sea till within about Sixty Leagues, yet is there no pa&s;|&s;age le&s;s us'd, nor more unknown, by rea&s;on of the Dangers of the Sea; nor could I find any one Per&s;on at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> that ever had undertaken it. I met with a great many that confirm'd my Report, and that had been at the Havens of <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> where there are great Numbers of <HI>Armenians</HI> and <HI>Georgians,</HI> the Subjects of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> King, who told me that it was not above &s;ix or &s;even Days Journey from thence into their Territories.</P>
<P>The Dangers of this Pa&s;&s;age which di&s;courage People from attempting it, are twofold: Fir&s;t, For that the <HI>Black Sea</HI> is very Tempe&s;tuous, to the lo&s;s of the mo&s;t part of the Ve&s;&s;els for want of skill and good Havens. Be&s;ides that the People that inhabit between the Sea and the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Territories are naturally barbarous and wicked, without any Religion, and under no Government: So that I &s;hould never have &s;o much as dreamt of the Way of <HI>Colchis,</HI> whatever might have been the Allurements of Curio&s;ity, or Ea&s;ine&s;s of Pa&s;&s;age, had not the Road through <HI>Turkey</HI> pre&s;ented it &s;elf much more Formi|dable, con&s;idering the Mi&s;chievous Circum&s;tances already men|tion'd. But that which mo&s;t inclin'd me to the Voyage by Sea, was the Conveniency of the <HI>Saic</HI> bound for <HI>Azac,</HI> which to me &s;eem'd a mo&s;t infallible way to get out of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> without much Trouble, and without any Danger, unle&s;s it were that of the <HI>Black-Sea.</HI> But that Sea &s;o nam'd and &s;o fam'd from terrible and frequent Shipwracks that happ'n in it for want of Skilful Pilots among the <HI>Turks,</HI> made me tremble to think of it. Neverthele&s;s I &s;aw the Hazards to which I expos'd my &s;elf, and the Dangers of the Voyage; however they did not terrifie me &s;o much as the Dangers and Perils
<PB N="63" REF="41">
which I have mention'd either in &s;taying any longer at <HI>Con|&s;tantinople,</HI> or in travelling quite through <HI>Turkey.</HI></P>
<P>The Danger indeed of the <HI>Black-Sea</HI> was the greate&s;t, be|cau&s;e it threaten'd the lo&s;s of all; but it was more uncertain. The Hazards of <HI>Turkey</HI> were le&s;s; for there was no fear of Life's being lo&s;t; or of lo&s;ing entirely the whole <HI>Cargo.</HI> But it was more difficult to be avoided, &s;o that at length I re&s;olv'd for the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI> and prepar'd to embark.</P>
<P>One of my Friends to whom I imparted my De&s;ign, en|gag'd a <HI>Greek</HI> Merchant to a&s;&s;i&s;t me, who was bound for <HI>Col|chis,</HI> and went in the <HI>Saic</HI> prepar'd for <HI>Azac.</HI> He was a very hone&s;t Man, be&s;ides that my Friend had &s;ome hank as well over his E&s;tate as Per&s;on. So that he oblig'd him to &s;erve me to the uttermo&s;t of his Power, under the forfeiture of his Friend&s;hip if he fail'd. Thereupon the <HI>Greek</HI> Merchant un|dertook to help me, and did it &s;o cordially and &s;edulou&s;ly that the Succe&s;s an&s;wer'd both his Diligence and Fidelity. He took upon him to hire Cabbins for me in the <HI>Saic,</HI> never di&s;cover|ing for whom it was; he put my Goods aboard, &s;ome and &s;ome, as he &s;aw his Opportunity. He gave me advice, and nece&s;&s;ary In&s;tructions how to make my &s;elf re&s;pected in the Ve&s;&s;el, and to get good Entertainment at <HI>Caffa,</HI> whither I was fir&s;t bound. Among the re&s;t of my Directions, he or|der'd me to get good Recommendations to the Officer that was to Command at <HI>Azac,</HI> and to take along with me the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s Pa&s;s. As for the Recommendation, I did not much fear to get it, but the Pa&s;s drove me to de&s;pair, becau&s;e I had already been refus'd it.</P>
<P>Thereupon I di&s;cover'd my perplexity to <HI>M. de Nointel,</HI> be&s;eeching his Excellency to give me leave to make u&s;e of the Letters of Recommendation which I had from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Am|ba&s;&s;ador, who was at <HI>Paris,</HI> when I departed thence, for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> that I might by his means obtain a Pa&s;s as an Engli&s;h-Man Which although <HI>M. de Nointel</HI> &s;crupl'd at fir&s;t, yet he con&s;ented at length, when I told him the Urgency of my Occa&s;ions. So that he caus'd his Secretary both to write and carry his Letter to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, who was very glad to &s;erve his Excellency in my behalf. And indeed the Amba&s;&s;ador pur&s;u'd his Kindne&s;s with the greate&s;t Grace in the World, and with a real Affection, but without &s;ucce&s;s. For as the <HI>Caimacan</HI> was ready to &s;ign the Pa&s;s, Some-body gave him private Intimation to take a care what he did; for that the Pa&s;s requir'd of him was for
<PB N="64" REF="42">
a <HI>French-Man</HI> under pretence of being <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> Which &s;poil'd all; and made a Difference between the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador and the <HI>Caimacan,</HI> who complain'd of the Surprize; and be|tween the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador and <HI>M. de Nointel,</HI> whom he tax'd for having giv'n the <HI>Caimacan</HI> his private Intelli|gence.</P>
<P>The 19th of <HI>July</HI> the <HI>Greek</HI> Merchant who was to Con|duct me to <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> came to give me notice that the <HI>Saic</HI> lay at an Anchor near the Mouth of the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI> and only expected a fair Wind. So that I would pre&s;ently have gone aboard, but my Friends did not think it convenient, till the Ve&s;&s;el was ready to Sail, for fear I &s;hould be di&s;cover'd for a <HI>French-Man.</HI> Thereupon I &s;taid three days with <HI>Signor Sini|baldi Fie&s;chi, Re&s;ident</HI> of <HI>Genoa,</HI> at a Country-Hou&s;e which he had upon the <HI>Bo&s;phorus,</HI> and four days more at a fair Mona&s;tery of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> at the end of the Channel upon <HI>Europe</HI> &s;ide, over again&s;t the Harbour where the <HI>Saic</HI> lay at Anchor.</P>
<P>The <HI>Thracian Bo&s;phorus</HI> is certainly one of the Lovelie&s;t parts of the World. The <HI>Greeks</HI> call <HI>Bo&s;phori,</HI> tho&s;e Streights or Arms of the Sea which an Ox may be able to &s;wim over. This Channel is about Fifteen Miles in length, and about Two in breadth, in mo&s;t parts, but in others le&s;s. The Shores con&s;i&s;t of Ri&s;ing Grounds cover'd over with Hou&s;es of Plea|&s;ure, Wood, Gardens, Parks, Delightful Pro&s;pects, Lovely Wilderne&s;&s;es Water'd with Thou&s;ands of Springs and Foun|tains.</P>
<P>The Pro&s;pect of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> when ye behold it from the top of the <HI>Channel,</HI> at the di&s;tance of two Miles, is beyond compare, as being to my Eyes, as to all that ever &s;aw it, the mo&s;t Charming Pro&s;pect that can be &s;een. The Pa&s;&s;age through the <HI>Bo&s;phorus</HI> is the mo&s;t lovely and fulle&s;t of Diver|ti&s;ement that can be made by Water: And the number of Barks that Sail to and fro in fair Weather is very great. The Re&s;ident of <HI>Genoa</HI> told me, He made it his Pa&s;time to tell the Boats that Sail'd to and fro before his Hou&s;e from Noon to Sun-&s;et, in what time he told no le&s;s then Thirteen Hun|derd.</P>
<P>There are Four Ca&s;tles that &s;tand upon the <HI>Bo&s;phorus</HI> well Fortifi'd with great Guns: Two, Eight Miles from the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI> and Two more near the Mouth of the Channel. The Two latter were built not above Forty Years ago, to prevent the <HI>Co&s;&s;acks, Mu&s;covite</HI> and <HI>Polanders</HI> from entring into the
<PB N="65" REF="42">
Mouth of the Channel; who before made frequent Inroads into it with their Barks, almo&s;t within &s;ight of <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople.</HI></P>
<P>The 17th by break of day I embark'd, our Ve&s;&s;el being then under Sail. Above Four&s;core Ve&s;&s;els of different Bur|thens put to Sea at the &s;ame time. In ours there were about Two Hunderd Men; the Commander of <HI>Azac</HI> with his Train, to the Number of <HI>Twenty;</HI> a Hunderd Jani&s;aries, Thirty Ma|riners, and Fifty Pa&s;&s;engers. I had three Cabbins, two for my Comrade and my &s;elf, and the third for our Goods. Our Servants lay upon the Deck. Their Cabbins are very narrow and incommodious; ours being at the Prow. There were in all Thirty two in the <HI>Saic,</HI> with a great Cabbin for the Cap|tain very &s;pacious and hand&s;omely furni&s;h'd; wherein Ten Per&s;ons might lodge very conveniently. But that which is very inconvenient in the Turki&s;h Ve&s;&s;els is this, That they make no Provi&s;ion of any thing for Sub&s;i&s;tance, not &s;o much as of Wood and Water; for the re&s;t might well be endur'd. Every one has his Liberty to dre&s;s his Vittles three of four times a day. The Fire Place is upon the Deck near the Poop: where they who have any thing to dre&s;s carry their Kettle, their Wood and their Water. So that I have &s;een about Eigh|teen Pots together upon the Fire. Their Places of Ea&s;ement are with out&s;ide of the Ship near the Poop; like Cages, which they take off and hang on as they plea&s;e them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The <HI>Saics</HI> have no more then one Deck. Nor but two Ma&s;ts with a Bolt&s;prit; that is, a Main Ma&s;t and Mizen. The&s;e Ma&s;ts carry but two Sails, and for the mo&s;t part but one. They have no Shrouds but one that is very &s;mall, which is fix'd to the Main Ma&s;t, and hangs down upon the Deck. They have no Skuttles at the top of their Ma&s;ts. So that the Turki&s;h Seamen never run up to the Yards Arms to furl or loo&s;en their Sails, which is needle&s;s, becau&s;e the Yards Arm is always below upon the Deck; &s;o that when they would take the Wind, they only draw up the Yards Arm, to which the Sail is fix'd. The Top-Sail is ty'd to the Yards Arm, and when they would make u&s;e of it, they pull up the Yards Arm with a Pully fa&s;ten'd to the Top-Ma&s;t-Head. Thus it may be ea&s;ily &s;een that they neither under&s;tand the U&s;e of the Yard-Arms nor Ma&s;ts of a Ship.</P>
<P>Neither have they in the&s;e Ve&s;&s;els either Pumps to pump out the Water, nor Cap&s;talls to weigh their Anchors; but they empty out their Water with Pales: and then when they weigh

Anchor, there are Twenty or Thirty Men that take hold of the Anchor-Cables that run through two &s;mall Pulleys fa&s;ten'd to the Prow of the Ship, and draw up the Anchor with all their Might, till it be high enough. When a Ve&s;&s;el enters la|den into any Port, they fix four Anchors, two to her Poop, and two to her Prow, and &s;o let her lie. And this is all I have ob&s;erv'd in reference to the Building and Rigging of the&s;e &s;ort of Ve&s;&s;els among the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>As for their Navigation there is nothing of Art, nor Security in it: The be&s;t of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> or <HI>Greek</HI> Pilots depend only upon a bare Experience, without any Foundation of Rules. They never make any u&s;e of Sea-Carts, nor ever make tho&s;e exact Ob&s;ervations, like our Seamen, of the Ships way every day &s;et down in Journals, by which Ob&s;ervations they know how far they are from the place whither they intend. They under&s;tand very little of the Compa&s;s; only they know that the <HI>Flowre de Luce</HI> always tends toward the North. When they are to make any Voyage they &s;tay for a good Wind and fair Weather. Nor do they, when that is come, pre&s;ently put to Sea till they have &s;taid eight or ten Hours to &s;ee whether the Weather will hold or no: and generally they Sail along by the Shore, having the Land always in &s;ight. But when they are forc'd to take the Main Sea, then they make u&s;e of the Compa&s;s: To which purpo&s;e they know either by report or experience upon which hand they ought to have the North, that they may gain &s;uch a Harbour; which is all they have to guide 'em; for more then this they know not. Were they to make long Voyages in the open Sea, hardly one Ship would e&s;cape a Tempe&s;t, which they happily avoid, keeping as much as they can within &s;ight of Land, or near &s;ome Harbour. When the Wind is very high, they furl their Sails, and let the Ve&s;&s;el drive with the VVaves. If the VVind be contrary, they never &s;trive again&s;t it, but vere about, and rather return from whence they came, then endure the Violence of a contrary Sea. That which ruines 'em, is when the VVind blows 'em upon the Shore; for then they are &s;o out of heart, that they &s;plit immediately not knowing what it is to <HI>lie by.</HI></P>
<P>I have heard &s;everal old <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Captains affirm, That there are Fifteen Hunder'd Ve&s;&s;els upon the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI> of which they lo&s;e a Hunderd every Year. The mo&s;t dangerous place where Shipwracks are mo&s;t to be fear'd being at the En|trance of <HI>Bo&s;phorus.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="43">
The Entrance into it is very Narrow, where generally the VVinds encounter one another; of which there is one that &s;till keeps back the Ve&s;&s;els, which if it be violent dings 'em upon the Coa&s;t which is full of &s;harp Rocks; to the lo&s;s of &s;o many Galleys and Ships that their Number is hardly to be numberd. 'Tis but a little while &s;ince that no le&s;s then &s;eventeen Galleys were ca&s;t away in one day. And there is no que&s;tion but that the frequent Storms that ari&s;e at all &s;ea&s;ons in the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI> the Surges &s;hort, and cutting one upon another, its &s;treight and narrow Channel, and the dangerous Coa&s;ts that in part &s;urround it, are the chief cau&s;e of the &s;everal Ship|wracks that happ'n there. On the other &s;ide there is no doubt al&s;o but that skilful Pilots and good Seamen would &s;ave above half the Ve&s;&s;els which are there lo&s;t.</P>
<P>The Third of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> in the Morning we arriv'd at <HI>Caffa,</HI> after a Voyage of eight days, all which time we had very fair Weather and little Wind. Upon the Fifth we &s;py'd the Point of the <HI>Tauric Cher&s;onne&s;e.</HI> For the <HI>Greeks</HI> call that a <HI>Cher&s;onne&s;e,</HI> which the <HI>Latins</HI> call a <HI>Penin&s;ula,</HI> and they gave that Name to this almo&s;t <HI>Tauric</HI> I&s;land, becau&s;e it was fir&s;t inhabited by the <HI>Scythians</HI> of <HI>Mount Taurus.</HI> It lies toward the Ea&s;t and We&s;t, being about 250 Leagues in Circuit; that is, 35 Leagues in length, which I take from the <HI>North</HI> to the <HI>South,</HI> and 55 Leagues in the broade&s;t part. But the <HI>I&s;thmus</HI> that joyns it to the Continent is not above a League in breadth. The Mo|dern Geographers call it <HI>Crim Tartary</HI> and <HI>Precopen&s;ian Tar|tary.</HI> As much as to &s;ay <HI>Tartary</HI> full of Towns; to di&s;tingui&s;h the <HI>Tartars</HI> of this <HI>Penin&s;ula</HI> that live for the mo&s;t part in Cities, e&s;pecially all the Winter long, from tho&s;e other <HI>Euro|pean Tartars,</HI> which inhabit without the <HI>Penin&s;ula,</HI> call'd <HI>No|gays,</HI> as al&s;o <HI>Hordes</HI> or <HI>Hordou,</HI> a word which &s;ignifies an A&s;&s;embly, and of which the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> generally make u&s;e to &s;ignifie the Camp of an Army, or the Numerous Train of a Court. The Country belonging to the&s;e two &s;orts of <HI>Tartars, Precops</HI> and <HI>Nogays,</HI> is that which we call the <HI>Le&s;&s;er Tartary</HI> to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the <HI>A&s;iatick Tartars</HI> that inhabit beyond the <HI>Lake Maeotis,</HI> to the Ea&s;t of the <HI>Ca&s;pian Sea,</HI> and thence as far as <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>The Sea-Coa&s;t of this <HI>Precopens Penin&s;ula,</HI> to &s;peak of that part which &s;hoots farthe&s;t into the Sea as far as <HI>Caffa,</HI> con&s;i&s;ts of very high Shoars, and Mountains cover'd with Woods and Villages. And by the Accompt of the Seamen, it is from <HI>Con|&s;tantinople</HI> to <HI>Caffa</HI> through the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI> 750 Miles. Tho I
<PB N="68" REF="44">
know not how they reck'n, nor how it can agree, with what frequently happens, for the <HI>Saics</HI> to make the Voyage in two Days and two Nights ju&s;t. And therefore by my Accompt it is no more then Two Hunderd Leagues. Upon our coming to an Anchor; our Ve&s;&s;el fir'd two Guns, and the Commander de&s;ign'd for <HI>Azac</HI> made all his Musketeers give the Ca&s;tle a Volley. Which done, he went a&s;hoar with the Officers that were come to receive him in the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI>'s Name. Both the Ci|ty and Port are very free; for you have Liberty to go in and out, never asking any leave: Nor do they come aboard to &s;earch the Ve&s;&s;els. But when a Ship drops her Anchor, &s;eve|ral Boats make from the Haven to carry tho&s;e a&s;hoar that are de&s;irous to go.</P>
<P><HI>Caffa</HI> is a great Town built at the bottom of a little Hill upon the Sea-&s;hoar. It extends it &s;elf more in length then breadth, lying in length very directly from the <HI>South</HI> to the <HI>North;</HI> encompa&s;s'd with very &s;trong Walls, that advance a little into the Sea, which is the rea&s;on that when we take a Pro&s;pect of the City from the upper part of the Deck, it &s;eems to be built like a Half-Moon. The Ca&s;tle upon the <HI>South</HI> &s;ide &s;tands upon a Ri&s;ing Ground that commands all the parts thereabout, being very large, and the Re&s;idence of the <HI>Ba&s;ha.</HI> The other is not &s;o big, but well &s;tor'd and defended with great Guns; the Sea wa&s;hing that &s;ide which is next to it. They reck'n about 4000 Hou&s;es to be in <HI>Caffa;</HI> of which 3200 are inha|bited by <HI>Mahumetans, Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars,</HI> and 800 by <HI>Chri&s;ti|ans, Greeks</HI> and <HI>Armenians;</HI> though the <HI>Armenians</HI> are more numerous then the <HI>Greeks.</HI> The Hou&s;es are but &s;mall, and all built of Earth, as are al&s;o their <HI>Bazars</HI> or Market-places, their Publick Structures, Mo&s;quees, and Baths. There is not one Building of Stone in all the City, except eight Churches &s;ome|what gone to decay, formerly built by the <HI>Genoe&s;es.</HI> This <HI>Caffa</HI> was once call'd <HI>Theodo&s;ia,</HI> which the <HI>Greeks</HI> built in the fifth Age. Afterwards it fell under the Dominion of the <HI>Ge|noe&s;es,</HI> with &s;everal other Sea-Port Towns in &s;everal parts of that Sea, in the Thirteenth Age, in the time of the Holy War and during the weak and low Condition of the Ea&s;tern Emperors. But <HI>Mahomet</HI> the Second won all tho&s;e Places from the <HI>Genoe&s;es</HI> toward the end of the Sixteenth Age; <HI>Caffa</HI> being taken in the Year 1574.</P>
<P>The Soyl about <HI>Caffa</HI> is Dry and Sandy; nor is the Water good; but the Air is very pure and whol&s;om. There are very few Gardens about it, nor is there but little Fruit. How|ever
<PB N="69" REF="44">
they bring great Quantities from the Neighbouring Vil|lages, though it cannot be &s;aid to be very delicious. How|ever I do not know whether there be any other City in the World where other Provi&s;ions are cheaper and better. Their Mutton is exceeding well-ta&s;ted, and not above one Farthing a Pound. Their other Provi&s;ions of Bread, Fruit, Wild Fowl, and Butter, is &s;old proportionably at a cheaper Rate. Salt is as good as giv'n ye; and in a word, whatever is nece&s;&s;ary for Human Su&s;tenance co&s;ts little or nothing. Neverthele&s;s by the way take notice, that Fre&s;h Fi&s;h is a very great Rarity, and very &s;mall whatever that they catch in the parts round about the Harbour, and that only at certain times, as in <HI>Antumn</HI> and the <HI>Spring.</HI> Almo&s;t all the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars</HI> that live in the Town wear little Bonnets of Cloath fac'd with Sheepskins. But in regard that over all <HI>A&s;ia</HI> Bonnets are mo&s;t u&s;ually worn among the <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> tho&s;e of <HI>Caffa</HI> are oblig'd to fa&s;ten to theirs a little piece of Cloath, &s;uch as the <HI>Jews</HI> in <HI>Germany</HI> wear upon their Cloaks, to di&s;tingui&s;h 'em from the <HI>Maho|metans.</HI></P>
<P>The Road of <HI>Caffa</HI> is &s;helter'd from the Winds, except it be to the <HI>North</HI> and <HI>South-Ea&s;t:</HI> and the Ships lie at Anchor near the Shoar in Ten and Twelve Fathom Water, Ouzie at the bottom and very &s;afe. There is al&s;o a great Trade driven there, more then in any other Port belonging to the <HI>Black-Sea.</HI> During the Forty Days that I &s;taid there, I &s;aw come in and go out above Four Hunderd Sail of Ships, not count|ing little Ve&s;&s;els that keep clo&s;e to the Shoar. The mo&s;t u&s;ual and mo&s;t con&s;iderable Trade which they drive con&s;i&s;ts in Salt Fi&s;h, and Caveare, which comes from the Lake <HI>Maeotis,</HI> and is thence tran&s;ported into <HI>Europe,</HI> and as far as the <HI>Indies.</HI> 'Tis incredible what a World of Fi&s;h is caught in that Lake, con&s;i|dering its extent. And the rea&s;on which the Country People give for the Infinite Multitude of Fi&s;h there bred and taken, is this, For that the Water of that Lake being muddy, thick, and not very &s;alt, becau&s;e of the <HI>Tanais</HI> that empties it &s;elf in|to it, it invites not only the Fi&s;h out of <HI>Tanais</HI> and the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI> but al&s;o out of the <HI>Helle&s;pont</HI> and the <HI>Archipelago;</HI> where they breed and grow fat in a &s;mall time. Several Per&s;ons have a&s;&s;ur'd me, That they u&s;ually catch Fi&s;h in that Lake, which weigh every one Eight and Nine Hunderd Pounds, and of which they make between three and four Hunderd weight of Caveare. 'Tis true, I never &s;aw any &s;uch large Fi&s;h alive at <HI>Caffa;</HI> however I am apt to believe it, by the pieces of
<PB N="70" REF="45">
Fi&s;h which I have &s;een, and the va&s;t Quantities which they export into a Thou&s;and Places. Their Fi&s;hing la&s;ts from <HI>Octo|ber</HI> till <HI>April.</HI> And perhaps it is the Mudd of that Water of <HI>Maeotis</HI> which makes 'em call it a <HI>Mer&s;h;</HI> for other|wi&s;e it would be more properly call'd a Lake, in regard it bears Ve&s;&s;els of Burden, nor do the Waters ri&s;e or fall, and be&s;ides that it continually partakes of a great River and the Sea.</P>
<P>Next the Exportation of Caveare and Fi&s;h, the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable Trade is driv'n in Corn, Butter and Salt, with which this City furni&s;hes <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and &s;everal other places. The <HI>Caffa</HI> Butter is the be&s;t in all <HI>Turkey.</HI> The <HI>Venetians</HI> have &s;everal times de&s;ir'd leave to Trade to this Town; but it would never be granted. In the Year 1672. <HI>Signor Quirini</HI> was at great Expences to obtain it, and he had obtain'd it indeed, but the Cu&s;tomer of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> caus'd the Licence to be revok'd upon this Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>All the <HI>Europeans</HI> have it agreed in their Capitulations, That they &s;hall pay no Cu&s;toms, but in &s;uch places where they un|lade their Goods. By Virtue of which Article the <HI>Venetians</HI> would pay no Cu&s;toms at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> for Goods that came in a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el bound for <HI>Caffa,</HI> which the Farmer of the Cu&s;toms claim'd. And <HI>Signor Quirini</HI> obtain'd an Or|der from the <HI>Defterdar</HI> to the <HI>Farmer,</HI> not to take any Cog|nizance of what was in the &s;aid <HI>Venetian</HI> Ve&s;&s;el: (Which <HI>Defterdar</HI> is the High Trea&s;urer of the Empire; and has all the Cu&s;toms under his In&s;pection.) But the Cu&s;tomer &s;eeing this Order, wrote to the <HI>Vizier,</HI> That the Trade of the <HI>Venetians</HI> into the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI> would be very prejudicial to the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> and the <HI>Port,</HI> and that the particular Damage to his Highne&s;s was mo&s;t vi&s;ible, in regard the Merchandize which is proper for the <HI>Black-Sea</HI> and brought from <HI>Venice</HI> pays Cu&s;toms twice, at their coming into the <HI>Port</HI> of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and going out. That it was the &s;ame thing as to the Com|modities that were brought out of that Sea, and which the <HI>Ve|netians</HI> Export, all which the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> would lo&s;e if the <HI>Venetians</HI> had Liberty to Trade thither, in regard that by Vir|tue of their Capitulations, they ought to pay no Cu&s;toms but where they di&s;charge their Merchandi&s;es. Be&s;ides, that to permit the <HI>Venetians</HI> an Entrance into the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI> was to open a new way for the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Princes to Corre&s;pond and Confederate with the Princes who&s;e Dominions border upon tho&s;e Seas who are all Enemies to the <HI>Port.</HI> And la&s;tly,
<PB N="71" REF="45">
That it behov'd him to con&s;ider that &s;uch a Permi&s;&s;ion would ruine a great Number of Seamen, of the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s Sub|jects, as well <HI>Turks</HI> as <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> for that in regard there is more Security in the <HI>European</HI> Navigation then in the <HI>Turki&s;h,</HI> the <HI>Venetians</HI> would have all the Carriage of Goods through the <HI>Black Sea,</HI> and every one would Ship his Goods in their Ve&s;&s;els. The <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> was &s;en&s;ible of this; and there|fore gave Orders to the Governor of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> not to let any <HI>Venetian</HI> Ship pa&s;s into the <HI>Black-Sea.</HI></P>
<P>The 30th my <HI>Grecian</HI> Guide unladed my Goods, Baggage, and whatever belong'd to me out of the Ship that brought me to <HI>Caffa,</HI> and Ship'd it aboard another Ve&s;&s;el bound for <HI>Colchis.</HI> Which done, he went to the <HI>Cu&s;tomer</HI> of <HI>Caffa,</HI> and told him, That there were two <HI>French Papa</HI>'s aboard the Ve&s;&s;el of <HI>Azac,</HI> who were de&s;irous to Embark them&s;elves in another Ve&s;&s;el, being bound for <HI>Mingrelia.</HI> That tho&s;e <HI>Papa</HI>'s carry'd &s;everal Trifles along with 'em, as Books, and other Things of no va|lue, for the U&s;e of a Mona&s;tery; and that if the <HI>Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e</HI> thought fit, that he &s;hould &s;end &s;ome of their Offi|cers to &s;earch the Ship. For the <HI>Oriental Chri&s;tians</HI> as well as the <HI>Turks,</HI> call <HI>Papa</HI>'s all manner of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Per&s;ons that Officiate in Holy Orders, whether Single or Married; and therefore my Guide thought fit that my Companion and my &s;elf &s;hould both take upon us the Title of <HI>Papa</HI>'s.</P>
<P>To that purpo&s;e our <HI>Greek</HI> made 'em believe, that we were going to the <HI>Italian Mi&s;&s;ionaries</HI> in <HI>Colchis,</HI> and that we were of their Fraternity. However the <HI>Cu&s;tomer</HI> &s;ent his Officers aboard to &s;earch our Packs; and our <HI>Greek</HI> came along with him. Pre&s;ently I open'd two Che&s;ts before the Searcher; who put his Hand into one that was full of only Books, Pa|pers, and Mathematical In&s;truments, and finding nothing more at the Bottom, then what he &s;aw at the Top, fell a laughing, and ask'd the Man that brought him, If &s;uch Rub|bi&s;h as that were worth carrying out of <HI>Europe</HI> into <HI>Mingrelia?</HI> With that I fumbl'd out one of tho&s;e Pieces that are worth Three Shillings, like a Man that had not much to &s;pare, but look'd upon five or &s;ix of tho&s;e Pieces to be a great Trea&s;ure, and pre&s;ented the Searcher with it; who refus'd it at fir&s;t, but took it at la&s;t, when I told him 'twas only to pay for his Boat, which he could not deny; and &s;o went away without more ado. My Guide went along with him, and heard the Re|port which he made to the Cu&s;tomer, That we had nothing
<PB N="72" REF="46">
but a few Books and Papers, with &s;ome few Toys of Bra&s;s and Wood that were of little or no Value.</P>
<P>At the end of two Hours my faithful Guide return'd, and told me, That to protect us ab&s;olutely from any further danger of the <HI>Cu&s;tomers,</HI> it behov'd us to give the Clerk of the Ve&s;&s;el as much as we had giv'n the Searcher; in regard the Clerk took an exact Note of all that was embark'd, and gives it every Even|ing to the <HI>Cu&s;tomer,</HI> who keeps it for a Control: to which I an&s;wer'd, That he might do what he thought fit. Thereup|on pre&s;ently calling to the Clerk, Thou &s;ee&s;t, &s;aid he, that the Searcher has found nothing in the <HI>Frank Papa</HI>'s Che&s;ts. They have one more full of Papers, and five or &s;ix Boxes of Pictures for their Church. That they did not op'n 'em be|cau&s;e the Air &s;poils the Colour of the Painting, and becau&s;e the Pictures were carefully ty'd up in Bundles; and therefore I de&s;ire thee to accept of this Three Shillings which they give thee, and to put down in thy Note no more then the two Che&s;ts which the Searcher has &s;een, without taking Cogni|zance of the re&s;t. Upon which he let us carry away all that we had, and bid us, <HI>Farewel in the Name of God.</HI> So that we carry'd off all our Goods in two Boats, and put 'em aboard the Ship that was bound for <HI>Mingrelia.</HI> Nor did any Body demand any thing of us. For the Cu&s;tomers, and the Seamen of the Ship which we left as well as of the other Ve&s;&s;el where|in we embark'd again, really believ'd us to be <HI>Papa</HI>'s, and that all we carry'd with us was of little worth: that the Sacks wherein I told 'em were our Provi&s;ions were full of no|thing el&s;e be&s;ide. For there are certain Slights and Shifts which we cannot &s;o well &s;et down, that are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for tho&s;e that travel <HI>Turkey,</HI> that they who can make a right u&s;e of may pa&s;s &s;ecurely and without trouble. For thereby we avoid Forfeitures and ill u&s;age, and we free our &s;elves dex|trou&s;ly from the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;es, which take 'em all together, are none of the &s;evere&s;t. But after all, it requires Good Luck, that is to &s;ay, a prudent Conduct and a Contrivance proper to the Genius of the <HI>Turks;</HI> and a Man mu&s;t al&s;o be &s;ure to watch his Opportunities.</P>
<P>The 25th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> the Ve&s;&s;el that brought us to <HI>Caffa,</HI> fet Sail for the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Azac,</HI> with three <HI>Saics</HI> of the &s;ame Burden in her Company. The New Commander would not have had her &s;et Sail till the return of the <HI>Courrier</HI> which he had &s;ent to the Fortre&s;s, to know whether they were at Peace with the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> and whether there were any Pirates or
<PB N="73" REF="46">
not Crui&s;ing upon the Lake <HI>Maeotis.</HI> The People of <HI>Caffa</HI> reck'n it 450 Miles from thence to <HI>Azac:</HI> though it be not &s;o much by Land, in regard they travel it ea&s;ily in Twelve or Thirteen Days. As for the Streight of the Lake <HI>Maeotis,</HI> or rather the Channel between the Lake and the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI> it is about five Leagues in length. Which Channel was by the Ancients call'd the <HI>Cimmerian Bo&s;phorus;</HI> but now the Moderns call it the Steight of <HI>Caffa,</HI> and al&s;o the <HI>Mouth of St. John.</HI> The great Ve&s;&s;els that go to <HI>Azac</HI> put in at <HI>Pale&s;tra,</HI> which is For|ty Miles from the Fortre&s;s, and Twenty from the River <HI>Ta|nais;</HI> for that there is not Water deep enough for 'em to Sail any farther. The Fortre&s;s of <HI>Azac</HI> is Fifteen Miles from the River: And it is very dangerous and hazardous to &s;end either Men or Money to that Place; for they are attack'd by &s;trong Parties of the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> as well by Sea as by Land. The Commanders of this Fortre&s;s make always Leagues with the Neighborhood, though they &s;eldom la&s;t long: for that either of one &s;ide or t'other there ari&s;e every day new Occa&s;ions to break 'em. The <HI>Turks</HI> have two little Fortre&s;&s;es where they keep Gari&s;on at the Mouth of the <HI>Tanais</HI> upon the Banks of that great River which the Ancients call'd <HI>Orxentes,</HI> and which the People of the Country call <HI>Don,</HI> being about Four&s;core Leagues in length. They Fortifie the Mouth of this River with a va&s;t Chain, to prevent the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> and <HI>Circa&s;&s;ians</HI> from Roving with their great Barks upon the Lake and the <HI>Black-Sea.</HI> For before tho&s;e two Fortre&s;&s;es were built, and this Chain fa&s;ten'd athwart the River, tho&s;e People came down with their Boats and Gruis'd about all over tho&s;e Seas. But there is a &s;top now put to their great Ve&s;&s;els. However in the Night-time, and by the power of Number, they &s;ome|times force their &s;maller Barks over the Chain; but 'tis very rarely that they will venture, for fear of being &s;unk by the Shot from the two Forts. There was al&s;o formerly another Fort three Leagues off from the <HI>Mer&s;h</HI> call'd <HI>Tana,</HI> belonging to the River <HI>Tanais;</HI> but it is now ruin'd; nor is it <HI>Azac,</HI> as &s;ome would have it to be, which is fifteen Leagues di&s;tant from it.</P>
<P>The 30th our Ve&s;&s;el put to Sea, and Sail'd to a place call'd <HI>Don&s;low,</HI> or the Salt-Pits; which are great <HI>Mer&s;hes</HI> of Salt up|on the Shoar fifty Miles from <HI>Caffa.</HI> We arriv'd there the 31&s;t in the Morning: Immediately all the People went to Lade Salt; for there was no Guard kept upon it; and they a&s;&s;ur'd us that Two Hunderd Ve&s;&s;els were Laden there every Year
<PB N="74" REF="47">
with Salt, and that there was enough for twice as many if there were occa&s;ion. The&s;e Salt-Pits are &s;upply'd without any Charges: For they only let in the Water into the <HI>Mer&s;h;</HI> which is a fat and hard Earth at the bottom. There it con|geals and becomes a white Salt, which has all the good Qua|lities of Salt, and among the re&s;t that it pre&s;erves the Moi|&s;ture of Salted Meats.

<P>About a Mile from the Shoar there is a Habitation of the <HI>Tartars;</HI> whither I went with &s;ome of my Servants to buy Provi&s;ions, but I did not &s;ee in all that place above Ten or Twelve Hou&s;es with a little Mo&s;quee. Only round about it there was a great Number of Tents, Round and Square very well clos'd, together with &s;everal Wagons clo&s;e and cover'd, which &s;erve 'em in &s;tead of Hou&s;es. The faire&s;t of their Tents were very hand&s;ome, being made of Round Poles lay'd a cro&s;s one upon another, and cover'd without with large Furs very light and well &s;tretch'd. The Door is made after the &s;ame Manner, with an opening at the Top, for the Light to come in, and the Smoak to go out. The Door is &s;hut with a piece of Felt. The in&s;ide is Hung with Tape&s;try, and the Floor cover'd al&s;o with the &s;ame. Every Family has one Tent of the &s;ame Fa&s;hion and two others. The other is cover'd with a great Sarpler of Wooll, for their Cattel and Hor&s;es. The other cover'd with the &s;ame, but not &s;o hand&s;ome, and much larger; in the mid&s;t of which is a round Pit five Foot deep and two Foot wide, and there it is that they dre&s;s their Vittles. Here their Slaves lie, and here they keep their Pro|vi&s;ions for the Family. The <HI>Tartars</HI> &s;tore up their Corn and their Forrage, as do all the Country People in the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> in deep Pits under Ground which they call <HI>Amber,</HI> or Maga|zines. Which they cover &s;o exactly, that you cannot di&s;cern where they have remov'd the Earth, &s;o that only they that made the Pits can tell where to find 'em. The <HI>Tartars</HI> dig the&s;e Pits either in their Tents or in the Field; and as I have &s;aid they cover the&s;e Pits &s;o like the re&s;t of the &s;urface of the Earth round about it, that you cannot perceive where they broak the Ground. When they remove their Quarters, they do it pre&s;ently and without any Trouble; their Tents being pull'd down and lad'n in le&s;s then Half an Hour. Their mo&s;t u&s;ual Carriage is by Oxen and Hor&s;es of which they breed a Great Number. The People profe&s;s the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Religion

<P>The 2d of <HI>September</HI> the Wind blew hard and contrary, &s;o that we were con&s;train'd to return for <HI>Caffa,</HI> in regard the Coa&s;t where we lay was very dangerous.</P>
<P>The Seventh at Midnight we put again to Sea with fair Weather, which did not long continue. For in the Morning ro&s;e a mo&s;t furious Tempe&s;t, in&s;omuch that we were afraid of be|ing ca&s;t away; and that which encreas'd our fears was this, that our Ve&s;&s;el was very deep Loaden, not only the Hold be|ing full, but Twelve Foot High above Deck. But the Storm, thanks be to God, was &s;oon over, and that which &s;av'd us was this, that the Wind was with us.</P>
<P>Our Ships Lading con&s;i&s;ted in Salt, Fi&s;h, <HI>Caveare,</HI> Oyl, Bi&s;cuite, Wooll, Iron, Tin, Copper, Copper and Farthen Ware, in all &s;orts of Harne&s;s, Arms, Uten&s;ils of Husbandry, Cloth, Linnen of all Colours, Habits for Men and Women, Coverlets, Carpets, Leather, Boots and Shooes, and in a word in all things mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for Mans U&s;e. There were all &s;orts of Grocery and Pothecary's Ware, Spices, Perfumes, Drugs and all manner of Oyntments. So that the Ve&s;&s;el &s;eem'd to be a little Town, where every thing was to be had; be&s;ides the People that were aboard, to the Number of a Hunderd.</P>
<P>The 8th in the Morning we di&s;cover'd the Coa&s;ts that bound the Lake <HI>Maeotis,</HI> which were very High Lands about 30 Miles di&s;tant from us. In the Evening we found our &s;elves near <HI>Cape Cuodos</HI> which <HI>Ptolomy</HI> calls <HI>Cirocondoma,</HI> &s;houting out far into the Sea; the &s;hoar being all very High Land, and &s;een a great way off. From <HI>Caffa</HI> to this Point, we &s;ail'd all along in the Channel, from whence to <HI>Mingrelia</HI> we always kept along by the &s;hoar.</P>
<P>It is Six and Twenty Mile from <HI>Caffa</HI> to the Channel of the Lake <HI>Maeotis.</HI> The Country on each &s;ide is all in Subjecti|on to, and inhabited by the <HI>Tartars,</HI> but &s;o very thinly that all the Coa&s;t is like a de&s;ert. From the Channel of the <HI>Palus Maeotis</HI> to <HI>Mingrelia</HI> they reck'n it Six Hunderd Miles along the Coa&s;t, which con&s;i&s;ts of plea&s;ant Mountains cover'd with Woods, inhabited by the <HI>Circa&s;&s;ians</HI> whom the Turks call <HI>Cherks.</HI> By the Ancients they were generally call'd <HI>Za|geans,</HI> as al&s;o Mountaineers. <HI>Pomponious Mela</HI> calls 'em <HI>Sar|gacians.</HI> They are neither the Subjects of the <HI>Port,</HI> nor Tri|butary to it; their Climate being very bad, cold and moi&s;t;

it produces no Wheat, nor indeed does it afford any thing that is rare and valuable; which is the rea&s;on that the <HI>Turks</HI> leave all this va&s;t Country to the Natives, not worth the Toyl of Conquering, nor the Charge of Keeping. The Ve&s;&s;els that are bound from <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> and <HI>Caffa</HI> for <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> ca&s;t An|chors in &s;everal places along the&s;e Coa&s;ts, and &s;tay at every place a Day or two: During which time they Trade with the <HI>Cherks</HI> with their Arms i' their Hands. For when any of them de&s;ire to come aboard, they give Ho&s;tages, and &s;o they likewi&s;e do when any of the Seamen or Per&s;ons in the Ship de&s;ire to go a&s;hoar, which is very &s;eldom; for they are a very perfidious People: and therefore they give three Ho&s;tages for one. The Seamen carry thither all the very &s;ame Commodi|ties which they carry into <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> for which they take in Exchange Slaves of all Sexes and Ages; Honey, Wax, Lea|ther, and <HI>Chacal-Skins;</HI> which <HI>Chacal</HI> is a Bea&s;t like a <HI>Fox,</HI> but much bigger. <HI>Zerdava</HI>'s, which is a Furr that re&s;embles a <HI>Martin;</HI> with the Furrs of other Bea&s;ts that breed in the Mountains of <HI>Circa&s;&s;ia.</HI> Which is all to be had among the&s;e People. They Exchange their Commodities after this man|ner: The Ship-Boat Rows clo&s;e to the Shoar, and they that are in it are well arm'd. Nor will they &s;uffer a greater Num|ber of <HI>Cherks</HI> to come nearer the place where the Boat lies then they them&s;elves are: For if they &s;ee a greater Number approach, they pre&s;ently put out to Sea. When they are come &s;o near as to talk one to another, they &s;hew their Commodities, agree up|on the Barter to be made, and pre&s;ently make the Exchange: however it behoves 'em to &s;tand upon their Guard all the while: For the <HI>Cherks</HI> are Infidelity and Perfidy it &s;elf; and it is an Impo&s;&s;ibility for 'em to find an Opportunity to &s;teal, but they take their Advantage.</P>
<P>They are a People altogether Savage: formerly Chri&s;tians; but now of no Religion, not having &s;o much as the Light of Nature among 'em. For I look upon their Super&s;titious Cu|&s;toms as nothing; which &s;eem to be a Mixture borrow'd from the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> and <HI>Mahumetans</HI> their Neighbors. They live in Woodden Huts, and go almo&s;t Naked. Every Per&s;on is a &s;worn Enemy to tho&s;e that live in the Provinces round about 'em. The Inhabitants make Slaves one of another, and &s;ell one another to the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars.</HI> And for their Ground the VVomen Till and Manure it. The <HI>Cherks</HI> and their Neigh|bors live upon a kind of Pa&s;te made of a very &s;mall Grain like to Millet: and they who have Traffick along the&s;e Coa&s;ts

will tell ye a Thou&s;and Stories of the Barbarous Cu&s;toms of the&s;e People. However there is no &s;afety in believing the Reports which are &s;pread abroad either of tho&s;e that live upon the Sea-Coa&s;ts, or of tho&s;e that inhabit farther up in the Coun|try; in regard that no body travels thither, and all that we know is by means of the Slaves that are brought from thence, who are all meer Savages, from whom there is nothing to be learnt of Certainty. This is the rea&s;on why I have made no more De&s;criptions of Places in my Map of the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI> which is at the beginning of this Book, chu&s;ing rather to leave a &s;pace for the <HI>Circa&s;&s;ians</HI> and <HI>Abca</HI>'s void, then to fill it up upon the Credit of People &s;o illiterate, who for the mo&s;t part can hardly tell the <HI>North</HI> from the <HI>South.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Abca</HI>'s border upon the <HI>Cherks,</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing about a Hun|derd Miles of the Sea-Coa&s;t between <HI>Mingrelia</HI> and <HI>Circa&s;&s;ia.</HI> However they are not altogether &s;o much Savages as the <HI>Cherks,</HI> but they are equally inclin'd with <HI>Them</HI> to Thieving and Robbery. The Seamen al&s;o Trade with 'em, with the &s;ame Precautions as with their Neighbors already mention'd. They &s;tand in need of the &s;ame Commodities as their Neigh|bors, and make their Exchanges in Slaves, Furrs, Does and Tigres Skins, Linnen, Thread, Box, Wax and Honey.</P>
<P>The 10th of <HI>September</HI> we arriv'd at <HI>I&s;gaour:</HI> Which is a Road belonging to <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> pretty &s;afe in the Summer: and there the Ve&s;&s;els that Trade into <HI>Colchis</HI> lie; &s;o that we &s;aw &s;even great Ships there, when we arriv'd in the Road. Pre|&s;ently our Captain fa&s;ten'd his own Ve&s;&s;el to four Anchors, two at the Prow and two at the Poop, and carry'd his Ma&s;ts and his Yards a&s;hoar. As for <HI>I&s;gaour</HI> it is a de&s;ert place without any Habitations: only according to the Number of Traders that come thither, they build up Huts and Booths of Boughs, as they find them&s;elves &s;ecure from the <HI>Abca</HI>'s, which does not often happen. But be&s;ides tho&s;e Huts, there is not one Hou&s;e to be &s;een.</P>
<P>Now before I enter into the Relation of the Hard&s;hips which I &s;uffer'd, and the Dangers I underwent in <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> I &s;hall give ye a De&s;cription of the Country and Parts that border about it, without intermixing any thing Dubious, or what I have not learnt by exact Information.</P>
<P><HI>Colchis</HI> is &s;ituated at the end of the <HI>Black-Sea.</HI> To the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> it is enclos'd with a little Kingdom, which makes a part of <HI>Georgia,</HI> which by the People of the Country is call'd <HI>Imiretta,</HI>

Which I know to be true, not only by the concurring Report of the People of the Country, but al&s;o as having cro&s;s'd it my &s;elf from one end to the other. It was formerly Fortifi'd again&s;t the <HI>Abca</HI>'s by a Wall Sixty Miles in length, which has been laid in Ruines the&s;e many Years: So that now the Thick Fore&s;ts are its chiefe&s;t Defence, and its greate&s;t Security. The Inhabitants of <HI>Cauca&s;us,</HI> that border upon <HI>Colchis,</HI> are the <HI>Alane</HI>'s, who&s;e Country was formerly the Northern Frontier of <HI>Armenia;</HI> the <HI>Suane</HI>'s, the <HI>Gigue</HI>'s, the <HI>Caracioles</HI> or <HI>Cara-cherks;</HI> a &s;ort of People more Barbarous then their Names. The&s;e <HI>Cara-cherks,</HI> as they are call'd by the <HI>Turks,</HI> that is to &s;ay, the <HI>Black Circa&s;&s;iens,</HI> are the Northern <HI>Circa&s;&s;i|ans.</HI> The <HI>Turks</HI> &s;o call 'em, though they are the faire&s;t Peo|ple in the World, by rea&s;on of the Foggs and Clouds that continually dark'n their Skie. Formerly they were Chri&s;tians; and &s;ome Relicks of their Cu&s;toms they retain, and &s;ome cer|tain Ceremonies al&s;o they ob&s;erve, yet at pre&s;ent they pro|fe&s;s no Religion, but live by Robbery and Rapine, utterly ig|norant of all Arts and Sciences, and having nothing that may entitle 'em to Humanity, but their Speech. They are much taller and more portly then other People; fo furious in their Looks, and &s;peaking with &s;uch a terrible Tone, that you may ea&s;ily thence di&s;cern their Di&s;po&s;itions and their Courage to be no le&s;s &s;avage. Their very Countenances are frightful to look upon; more e&s;pecially when you come to experience their Civility, and under&s;tand 'em to be the mo&s;t re&s;olute <HI>A&s;|&s;a&s;&s;ins,</HI> and mo&s;t daring Robbers in the World.</P>
<P>The Ancient Kingdom of <HI>Colchis</HI> was not &s;o &s;mall a Kingdom as now; for it extended on the one &s;ide to the <HI>Palus Maeotis,</HI> and the other way as far as <HI>Iberia.</HI> The Capital City was al&s;o call'd <HI>Colchis,</HI> &s;eated at the Mouth of <HI>Pha&s;is</HI> upon the We&s;tern &s;ide of the River, and that was the Rea&s;on that <HI>Mingrelia</HI> was formerly call'd <HI>Colchis;</HI> for that <HI>Mingrelia</HI> is bounded by this River, to the <HI>Ea&s;t.</HI> Our Modern <HI>Geographers</HI> have &s;eated ano|ther

City which they call <HI>Fa&s;&s;o,</HI> in the place where <HI>Colchis</HI> &s;tood; but this I know my &s;elf to be a grand Mi&s;take.</P>
<P>All the Oriental People call <HI>Colchis Odi&s;che,</HI> and the <HI>Colchi|ans Mingrelians;</HI> though I could never under&s;tand the Ety|mology of either of tho&s;e Words. The Country it &s;elf is unequal; full of Hills and Mountains, Valleys and Plains; which cau&s;es great variety of Pro&s;pect, and it ri&s;es in&s;en&s;ibly from the Sea-&s;hoar. It is almo&s;t all over cover'd with Woods, except the Fields that are Manur'd, which are not very many: and be&s;ides, the Woods are &s;o thick and tall, and the Trees grow &s;o fa&s;t, that if they did not grub up the Roots that &s;pread them&s;elves into the Till'd Land, and the High-ways, the whole Country in a &s;hort time would be nothing but a Thick Fore&s;t altogether Impa&s;&s;able. The Air is temperate as well in re|&s;pect of the Heat as Cold, but very moi&s;t and very unwhol|&s;om in regard of the extream wet Weather; for it rains there almo&s;t perpetually. In Summer the Moi&s;ture of the Earth, being heated by the Sun, infects the Air, and cau&s;es not only frequent Pe&s;tilences, but &s;everal other Di&s;tempers and Di&s;|ea&s;es. Therefore in&s;upportable to Strangers. For it reduces 'em to a Gha&s;tly Leanne&s;s, and renders 'em in a Years time yellow, juicele&s;s and faint. The Natives of the Country, more us'd to the Climate, are not &s;o much incommoded by it, for the time that they live, which is &s;eldom above Three&s;core Years.</P>
<P><HI>Colchis</HI> abounds with Water-Streams, which fall from the Mountains of <HI>Cauca&s;us,</HI> and di&s;charge them&s;elves into the <HI>Black-Sea.</HI> The Principal Rivers are <HI>Codours,</HI> which is that <HI>Corax</HI> I have already mention'd; the <HI>Socom,</HI> which I take to be the <HI>Ter&s;cen</HI> of <HI>Arrian,</HI> and the <HI>Tha&s;&s;eris</HI> of <HI>Ptolomy;</HI> the <HI>Langur,</HI> call'd by the Ancients <HI>A&s;tolphus;</HI> the <HI>Cobi,</HI> by <HI>Arrian</HI> call'd <HI>Cobo,</HI> which before it enters into the Sea, meets with another River call'd <HI>Ciani&s;cari,</HI> which was the Ancient <HI>Cianeus.</HI> The <HI>Tacheur</HI> which <HI>Arrian</HI> calls <HI>Sigamus;</HI> The <HI>Scheni&s;cari,</HI> that is to &s;ay, The <HI>River Hor&s;e,</HI> &s;o call'd from the Rapidne&s;s of its cour&s;e, and which the <HI>Greeks</HI> for the &s;ame Rea&s;on call <HI>Hippus,</HI> and the <HI>Aba&s;cia</HI> to which <HI>Strabo</HI> gives the Name of <HI>Glaucus, Arrian</HI> that of <HI>Caries,</HI> and <HI>Ptolomy</HI> that of <HI>Caritus.</HI> The&s;e two Rivers intermix with <HI>Pha&s;is,</HI> about Twenty Miles from the place where it di&s;charges it &s;elf into the Sea. I have &s;et down as well the Ancient as Modern Names of the <HI>Mingrelian</HI> Rivers, in regard that all the Hi&s;torical Geographers, e&s;pecially <HI>Arrian,</HI> and &s;everal of the Moderns place 'em ill. But be&s;ides the&s;e Rivers there are are &s;ome others of le&s;&s;er note; of which
<PB N="80" REF="50">
I &s;ay no more, for that before they fall into the Sea, they lo&s;e them&s;elves in tho&s;e larger Torrents already mention'd.</P>
<P>The Soyl of <HI>Colchis</HI> is very bad, and produces little Corn or Pul&s;e. The Fruits are almo&s;t all wild, without any ta&s;te, and very unwhol&s;om; and yet there grow in <HI>Colchis</HI> almo&s;t as many &s;orts as we have in <HI>France.</HI> They have al&s;o very large Melons, but they are worth very little or nothing. The only Fruit that thrives be&s;t in this Country are their Grapes; of which there is great Plenty. The Vines grow about the Trees, and run up to the very Top of the Boughs. I have &s;een &s;ome Stocks of the&s;e Vines that have been &s;o large, that I could hardly compa&s;s 'em with both my Arms. They prune their Vines every four Years, and as for the Wine of <HI>Mingrelia</HI> I mu&s;t needs &s;ay it is mo&s;t excellent. It is &s;trong, and has a very good Body; plea&s;ing to the Ta&s;te, and comfortable to the Stomach. Nor do I know where there is better in any part of <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> So that if the Country People knew how to make Wine &s;o well as we do, theirs would be the be&s;t in the World. But they never take any pains at all with it. They only hollow the larger Trunks of great Trees, which they make u&s;e of in &s;tead of Tubs. In tho&s;e they brui&s;e and &s;queeze the Grapes, and then pour out the Juyce into great Earthen Jarrs, which they bury in their Hou&s;es, or el&s;e hard by. The&s;e Ve&s;&s;els contain about two or three Hunderd Quarters. And when the Ve&s;&s;el is full, they clo&s;e it up with a Woodden Co|ver, and then lay the Earth upon it. For indeed they cover the&s;e Urns ju&s;t after the &s;ame manner as I have told ye that the Ea&s;tern People cover the Pits where they &s;tore up their Corn.</P>
<P>The Earth is &s;o moi&s;t in <HI>Mingrelia</HI> in Seed-time, that for fear of &s;oftning too much the Land where they &s;ow their Wheat and Barley, they never Plough it at all. They only ca&s;t their Grain upon the Top of the Earth, and that is &s;uffi|cient: for it comes up without any farther trouble, taking root a foot deep in the Mould. The <HI>Mingrelians</HI> moreover affirm, That &s;hould they Plough their Ground where they &s;ow their Barley and Wheat, it would be &s;o &s;oft that the lea&s;t Wind would lodge the Stalks, &s;o that they would never be able to ri&s;e again. Their other Lands they plough, and &s;ow their other Grain with Ploughs and Plough&s;hares of Wood, which make however as deep Furrows as if they were of Iron, by rea&s;on of the &s;oftne&s;s and moi&s;ture of the Earth, as I have already &s;aid.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="50">
Their u&s;ual Grain is <HI>Gom:</HI> which is a &s;ort of Grain as &s;mall as Coriander Seed, and very much re&s;embles Millet. Which they &s;ow in the Spring-time after the &s;ame manner as they do Rice: for they make a Hole in the Ground with their Finger, then put in the Grain and cover it. This Grain produces a Stalk about the bigne&s;s of a Mans Thumb, and grows up as high as mo&s;t Men are tall; at the end of which there is an Ear that contains above Three Hunderd Grains: And indeed the Gom-Stalk is very like to the Sugar-Cane. They gather this Grain in <HI>October,</HI> and pre&s;ently lay it upon high Hurdles expos'd to the Sun; which they do to dry it. After it has been Twenty Days upon the Hurdles, they bind it up in Sheaves; but they thra&s;h it only as they have occa&s;ion to boyl it, and they never boyl it, but ju&s;t before they go to eat it. It is in&s;ipid and heavy. Yet is it pre&s;ently boyl'd, and in le&s;s then half an hour after it is put into the Water, they &s;tir it &s;oftly with a Stick; and after it has &s;tood never &s;o little upon the Fire, it turns into Pa&s;t. When the Grain is all di&s;&s;olv'd, and the Pa&s;t well wrought together, they le&s;&s;en the Fire, let the Water boyl away, and the Pa&s;t harden and dry in the Skellet where it was boyl'd.</P>
<P>This Pa&s;t is very white; and &s;ome there is, which they make as white as Snow. They &s;erve it upon little Woodden Peels made on purpo&s;e. And this &s;ort of Bread the <HI>Turks</HI> call <HI>Pa&s;ta,</HI> the <HI>Mingrelians, Gom,</HI> being ea&s;ily brok'n between the Fingers: but it is of a very cold and laxative Quality; nor is it worth any thing, after it is once cold, or when it is heated a &s;econd time. However the <HI>Circa&s;&s;ians, Mingrelians,</HI> and <HI>Georgians,</HI> who are Tributary to the <HI>Turks,</HI> the <HI>Abca</HI>'s, the Mountaineers of <HI>Cauca&s;us,</HI> and all that inhabit the Coa&s;ts of the <HI>Black-Sea</HI> from the Lake <HI>Maeotis</HI> to <HI>Trebi&s;ond,</HI> live all upon this Pa&s;t. 'Tis all the Bread they have, nor have they any other; and indeed they are &s;o accu&s;tom'd to it, that they prefer it be|fore Bread made of Wheat, as I have ob&s;erv'd in mo&s;t parts of tho&s;e Countries which I have &s;een. Nor do I wonder at it; for when Nece&s;&s;ity con&s;train'd me to make it my Food, I found it &s;o acceptable to my Palate, that I could hardly leave it, when I came where I met with our u&s;ual Bread. Be&s;ides, I found my &s;elf very well, and my Body in a better Condition of Health then before. In <HI>Armenia</HI> and <HI>Georgia</HI> I &s;aw a great many of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> and <HI>Georgian</HI> Lords, and among the re&s;t the Prince of <HI>Tiftles</HI> and the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of <HI>Akalzike,</HI> who &s;ent for this Grain and eat it for a Delicacy: but it requires good &s;tore
<PB N="82" REF="51">
of Wine to wa&s;h it down, to correct and temper its cold and laxative Quality.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this <HI>Gom,</HI> they have in <HI>Mingrelia</HI> great plenty of Millet, &s;ome Rice, with Wheat and Barley, but very &s;carce. The People of Quality many times eat Wheaten Bread for a Dainty; but the meaner &s;ort never &s;o much as ta&s;te of it.</P>
<P>The ordinary Food of the Country is Beef and Pig; of which latter they have an extraordinary plenty, and that &s;o good, that the World does not afford better. There is al&s;o Goats Fle&s;h, but very lean, neither is it well ta&s;ted. Their Wild-Fowl is very good, but very &s;carce. While I was there, there was hardly any to be got, by rea&s;on that the Wars had hara&s;s'd all the Country. For Fi&s;h, there is none but Salt-Fi&s;h, which is brought from <HI>Turkey;</HI> Tunny Fi&s;h, and &s;ome few &s;mall Quantities of other Fi&s;h at certain &s;ea&s;ons of the Year. Their Venizon in <HI>Mingrelia</HI> is the Wild Boar, the Hart, the Stag, the Fallow Deer and Hare: which is &s;o excellent that there can|not be better Food. Partridge they have al&s;o, Phea&s;ants and Quails in abundance, &s;ome River-Fowl, and Wild Pigeons, which are very good Meat, and as big as our Cramm'd Chicken. The <HI>Mingrelians</HI> catch the&s;e Pigeons with Nets, and take great Numbers of 'em in <HI>Autumn;</HI> for in the Winter they return to the Mountains of <HI>Cauca&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>The Nobility of <HI>Mingrelia</HI> &s;pend their whole time in the Field: and their chiefe&s;t delight is in Birds of Prey, which they tame and afterwards make u&s;e of for their &s;port. And indeed it may be truly &s;aid that the&s;e Birds of Prey are no where in the World in greater Numbers then in <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> as Lanner-Hawks, Gos-Hawks, Hobbies and others, which build and breed in Mount <HI>Cauca&s;us.</HI> The young Ones, as &s;oon as they are fledge, re&s;ort to the Fore&s;ts round about, where they take great Numbers, and reclaim 'em in five or &s;ix days.</P>
<P>But of all their Flights, that which yields the mo&s;t delight|ful Pa&s;time, is that of the <HI>Faulcon</HI> at the <HI>Heron.</HI> For River-Fowl and Phea&s;ants they only make u&s;e of their Sparrow-Hawks. To which purpo&s;e, as they do in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Turkey,</HI> they carry a little Drum at the Pummel of their Saddles to put up the Wild-Fowl with the Noi&s;e, and then let fly their Hawks at the Game. When they take any Herons, they only cut off the Feathers upon their Heads to make Heron Tufts for Bonnets, and then let 'em go again: for the People of the Country af|firm, that the Feathers grow again as fair and as beautiful as they were at fir&s;t. Be&s;ides the Fowl already nam'd, and which
<PB N="83" REF="51">
are to be found in <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> there are other &s;trange Fowl as well for their Shape as Feathers, altogether unknown in our parts; and not only tho&s;e, but a great Number of Eagles and Pelicans. All which <HI>Cauca&s;us</HI> produces, be&s;ides a great Num|ber of Wild Bea&s;ts, as Tigres, Leopards, Lyons, VVolves, and <HI>Chacalls;</HI> which are Creatures much re&s;embling Foxes, only that they are much bigger, and their Hair is much more thick and &s;haggy: and &s;ome will have this <HI>Chacal</HI> to be the <HI>Hyaena</HI> of the Ancients. For it digs up dead Bodies, and devours both living Creatures and Carrion. They bury their Dead in the Ea&s;tern Country without Coffins, only in their VVinding-Sheets. And therefore I have &s;een 'em in &s;ome parts rowl great Stones over the Graves of the Deceas'd, only for fear of the&s;e Bea&s;ts to prevent 'em from digging up the Graves, and devouring the dead Bodies. For <HI>Mingrelia</HI> is full of the&s;e <HI>Cha|calls</HI> and VVolves; in&s;omuch that they be&s;et the very Hou&s;es them&s;elves, where they make a mo&s;t dreadful howling Noi&s;e. The wor&s;t is, they make mo&s;t terrible Havock among their Cattel and Hor&s;es. The Superiour of the <HI>Theatins</HI> a&s;&s;ur'd me, that in one VVeek the VVolves eat him up three Hor&s;es and a Colt, clo&s;e by the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>There are a great Number of Hor&s;es, and very good ones too, in <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> of which every Man has a great many, in regard they co&s;t 'em little or nothing to keep. For as &s;oon as they alight, they take off their Bridles and Saddles, and turn 'em a Field: Nor do they ever Shooe 'em, or give 'em any other Food or Provender, then what they graze of them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>In <HI>Mingrelia</HI> are neither Cities nor Towns, only two Vil|lages by the Sea-&s;ide: But all the Hou&s;es are &s;catter'd &s;o thick up and down in the Country; that you &s;hall hardly travel a Mile, but you &s;hall meet with Three or Four together. There are al&s;o Nine or Ten Ca&s;tles, of which the chiefe&s;t is call'd <HI>Rucs,</HI> where the Prince of <HI>Mingrelia</HI> keeps his Court. This Ca&s;tle is &s;urrounded with a Stone-Wall, but &s;o ill built, and &s;o thin, that the lea&s;t Field-Piece will make its way through it: however there are &s;ome few Cannon within it; but the re&s;t of the Ca&s;tles have none at all: being all built after this manner.</P>
<P>In &s;ome level and open place in a Wood, they erect a Stone-Tower about Thirty or Forty Foot High, &s;ufficient to contain Fifty or Sixty Per&s;ons. This is the &s;tronge&s;t part of the Tower, where they &s;ecure all the Trea&s;ure of the Lord, and of tho&s;e
<PB N="84" REF="52">
that de&s;ire his Protection. Clo&s;e by this, &s;tand Five or Six other Towers built of Wood, much lower then the middle|mo&s;t, which are the Store-Hou&s;es for their Provi&s;ion; and where they put their Wives and Children, when they happen at any time to be a&s;&s;aulted. Be&s;ide which there are within the compa&s;s of the open place, &s;everal Hutts made of Carpen|ters Work; others, with Boughs of Trees, others of Canes and Reeds. The &s;pace is enclos'd with a very thick Hedge and with the Wood it &s;elf, which is &s;o thick that it is impo&s;&s;i|ble to come near tho&s;e retirements but by the way which is cut open on purpo&s;e. Which pa&s;&s;age, when they are afraid of an Enemy, they dig up and cover with Trees, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to be forc'd. Nor do the <HI>Colchians</HI> ever retire to the&s;e Ca&s;tles, but when they are in fear of an Enemy; for when the dan|ger is pa&s;t they return to their Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;es in <HI>Mingrelia</HI> are all of Carpenters Work; and Building is very cheap, by rea&s;on of the great Plenty of Wood. Of the&s;e Hou&s;es, the Poorer &s;ort contain but one Story: nor have tho&s;e of the Gentry and Nobility them&s;elves above two. The lower Rooms are always furni&s;h'd with Beds and Cou|ches to lie down and &s;it upon, by rea&s;on of the great Moi&s;ture of the Earth. The Per&s;ons of Quality &s;it upon Carpets, the meaner &s;ort upon Forms. But their Hou&s;es are very inconve|nient and Na&s;ty; as having neither Chimneys nor Windows. The Fire place is in the middle, and the light comes in at the Door. Their Hou&s;es are built upon no Foundations, which is the rea&s;on that they are ea&s;ily Rob'd. For the Thieves dig a hole under the fir&s;t Beam that lyes upon the Ground, and &s;upports all the re&s;t of the Fabrick, and &s;o creep into the Hou&s;e. And as &s;oon as the People begin to &s;tir, they get out again with the &s;ame ea&s;e. Which Inconvenience con&s;trains the Country Peo|ple to have no more then one Room for every Family. Where they keep all that they have about 'em, except their Corn, and &s;ometimes their Wine. So that they lie all together, and Hou&s;e their Cattel in the Night.</P>
<P><HI>Mingrelia</HI> breeds very good Blood; So that the Men are very well &s;hap'd, and the VVomen very hand&s;ome. Tho&s;e that are of any Quality carry always in their Countenances &s;ome certain Features and Graces that are very Charming. I have &s;een &s;ome wonderfully well &s;hap'd, that have had a very Maje&s;tick Air, with an A&s;pect and Proportion much to be admir'd. Be&s;ides, they have tho&s;e Obliging Glances, that win the Affections of all that behold 'em, and &s;eem as it were
<PB N="85" REF="52">
to command their Love. They that are not &s;o hand&s;ome, or in years, paint abominably, Colouring their Eyebrows, their Cheeks, Foreheads, No&s;es and Chins; but the re&s;t only paint their Eyebrows. They dre&s;s them&s;elves with all the curio&s;ity they can. Their Habit is like that of the <HI>Per&s;ians:</HI> but their Head-Attire is much like that of the <HI>European</HI> Women, ev'n to the curling of their Locks. They wear a Vail that covers on|ly the Top and Hinder part of the Head. They are naturally very &s;ubtle and of clear and quick Apprehen&s;ions. Extream|ly Civil, full of Ceremonies and Complements; but other|wi&s;e the wickede&s;t Women in the World, Haughty, Furious, Perfidious, Deceitful, Cruel, and Impudent. So that there is no &s;ort of VVickedne&s;s which they will not put in Execu|tion, to procure Lovers, pre&s;erve their Affection, or el&s;e to de&s;troy 'em.</P>
<P>The Men are endu'd with all the&s;e Mi&s;chievous Qualities with &s;ome Addition. There is no VVickedne&s;s, to which their Inclinations do not naturally carry 'em. But all addicted to Thievery. That, they make their &s;tudy; that they make their whole Imployment, their Pa&s;time and their Glory. A&s;&s;a&s;&s;i|nation, Murder and Lying are among them e&s;teem'd to be no|ble and brave Actions. But for Concubinage, Adultery, Bigamy, Ince&s;t, and all Vices of that Nature, they are Vertues in <HI>Mingrelia.</HI> They make nothing to take away one anothers Wives by force: and they Marry their Aunts, their Nieces, and their Wives Si&s;ters without any Scruple. He that has a mind to two VVives at a time, marries 'em without any more ado: and many there are that will have Three. Every Man keeps as many Concubines as they plea&s;e; the VVives never grudging their Husbands that convenience: for there is &s;eldome any &s;uch thing as Jealou&s;ie among 'em. If a Man take his VVife in the act with her Gallant, he has a Priviledge to compel him to pay him a Pig by way of &s;atisfaction; which they eat all Three together: and generally that is all the revenge the Per|&s;on injur'd takes. But this is the greate&s;t VVonder, that this VVicked Nation &s;hould maintain, that to have &s;everal VVives and Concubines is ju&s;tifiable: for &s;ay they, they bring us many Children, which we &s;ell for ready Money or Exchange for nece&s;&s;ary Conveniences. VVhich is nothing to another mo&s;t Inhuman Tenent of theirs, that it is a piece of Charity to Murder Infants newly Born, when they have not &s;ufficient wherewith to maintain 'em; or &s;uch as are Sick and pa&s;t hopes of recovery. And the rea&s;on they give is this, that by &s;o
<PB N="86" REF="53">
doing, they put tho&s;e Childern out of a great deal of Mi&s;ery which they would undergo in a langui&s;hing Di&s;temper, which in the end mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity carry 'em off. Such are the Ar|guments of the&s;e Barbarous People that have neither &s;hame, nor Humanity. I am afraid to tell the Truth, le&s;t Hi&s;tory &s;hould want belief in this particular, or that the Truths which I recount &s;hould be look'd upon as the Exorbitances of Rela|tion. But I aver 'em to be really true, as &s;ome actions which I &s;hall recite, will &s;ufficiently ju&s;tifie.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen of the Country have full Power over the Lives and E&s;tates of their Tenants, with whom they do what they plea&s;e. They &s;eize upon 'em, whether VVife or Chil|dren; they &s;ell 'em, or di&s;po&s;e of 'em otherwi&s;e as they think fit. Every Country-Man furni&s;hes his Lord with &s;o much Corn, Cattel, VVine, and other Provi&s;ions, as he is able. So that their Wealth con&s;i&s;ts in the Number of their Va&s;&s;als. Be|&s;ides, every one is oblig'd to entertain his Lord Two or Three days in a Year at their own Expences. VVhich is the rea&s;on that the Nobility, &s;o long as the Year la&s;ts, go from one place to another devouring their Tenants, and &s;ometimes the Tenants of other Men.</P>
<P>The Prince him&s;elf leads the &s;ame Life, &s;o that 'tis a hard matter every day to know where to find him. VVhen the Va&s;&s;als of &s;everal Lords are at difference, their Ma&s;ters decide the di&s;pute: but when the Lords are at variance among them|&s;elves, force and main &s;trength determine the Quarrel, and the &s;toute&s;t Arm gets the better. There is not a Gentleman in <HI>Min|grelia</HI> but has &s;ome quarrel or other. And therefore it is, that they always go arm'd, and as numerou&s;ly attended as they can. VVhen they ride, they are arm'd at all Points, and their fol|lowers al&s;o; nor do they ever &s;leep without their Swords by their &s;ides; and when they go to Bed, they &s;leep upon their Belleys, laying their Swords under 'em.</P>
<P>Their Arms are a Lance, Bow and Arrows, a &s;treight Sword, a Mace and a Buckler; but there are very few that carry Fire Arms. They are very good Souldiers, &s;it a Hor&s;e very well, and handle their Lances with an Extraordinary Dexterity.</P>
<P>Their Habit is peculiar; and unle&s;s they be the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Per&s;ons, they wear but very little Beard. They Shave all the Top of their Heads in a Circle, &s;uffering the re&s;t of their Hair to grow down to their Eyes, and then clip it round of an even length. They cover their Heads with a light Cap of Felt
<PB N="87" REF="53">
very thin par'd, and cut into &s;everal Half-Moons about the Edges. In the VVinter they wear a furr'd Bonnet: They are moreover &s;o beggarly and &s;o wretched, that for fear of &s;poiling their Caps or their Bonnets in the Rain, they will put 'em in their Pouches, and go Bare-Headed. Over their Bodies they wear little Shirts, that fall down to their Knees, and tuck into a &s;treight <HI>Pantaloon.</HI> Nor indeed is there any habit in the VVorld more deformed then theirs. They carry a Rope &s;eve|ral Fadoms long at their Girdles, to tye together &s;uch People or Cattel which they Rob from their Neighbours, or take in War. The Nobles wear Leathern Girdles Four Fingers broad, full of Silver Studs, at which they hang a Knife, a Whet|&s;tone, and a Steel to &s;trike Fire: together with Three Lea|thern Pur&s;es, the one full of Salt, the other of Pepper, and the other with Pack-Needles, Le&s;&s;er-Needles, and Thread. The Poor People go almo&s;t naked; &s;uch is their Mi&s;ery not to be parallell'd; as not having any thing to cover their Nakedne&s;s but a pityful &s;orry Felt like to the <HI>Chlamys</HI> of the Ancients; into which they thru&s;t their Heads, and turn which way they plea&s;e as the Wind &s;its; for it covers but one &s;ide of their Bo|dies, and falls down no lower than their Knees. There are &s;ome, that are par'd very thin to keep out the Water, which are not &s;o heavy as the common &s;ort; that are ready to weigh a Man down, e&s;pecially when thorough wet. He that has a Shirt and a pair of pitiful Drawers, thinks him&s;elf Rich; for almo&s;t all of 'em go Bare-Foot; and &s;uch of the <HI>Colchians</HI> as pretend to Shooes, have nothing but a piece of a <HI>Bufalo</HI>'s Hide, and that untann'd too; which piece of raw Hide is lac'd about their Feet with a Thong of the &s;ame: &s;o that for all the&s;e &s;ort of <HI>Sandals,</HI> their Feet are as durty, as if they went Bare-Foot.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t all the <HI>Mingrelians,</HI> both Men and Women, even the mo&s;t noble and wealthy, never have but one Shirt, and one pair of Breeches at a time; which la&s;t 'em at lea&s;t a Year: In all which time they never wa&s;h 'em above Three times: only Once or Twice a VVeek they &s;hake 'em over the Fire, for the Vermin to drop off, with which they are mightily haunted; and indeed, I cannot &s;ay I ever &s;aw any thing &s;o Na&s;ty and Loath&s;ome. VVhich is the rea&s;on that the <HI>Mingrelian</HI> Ladies carry a very bad &s;cent about 'em. I always accoa&s;ted 'em, extreamly taken with their Beauty; but I had not been a Mi|nute in their Company, but the Rank VVhiffs from their Skins quite &s;tifl'd all my Amorous Thoughts.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="54">
The Grandees Eat, &s;itting upon Carpets, after the manner of the Ea&s;tern People Their Napkin is only a piece of painted Cloath, or Leather, and &s;ometimes they only wipe upon the Boards. The Ordinary &s;ort &s;it upon a Form, with another Form before 'em of the &s;ame height, which &s;erves for a Table. All their Di&s;hes are of Wood to their very Drinking Cups: only among the People of Quality you &s;hall &s;ee a little Silver Plate.</P>
<P>Moreover it is the cu&s;tome in this Savage Country, that the whole Family without di&s;tinction, Males and Females, Eat all together. The King with all his Train to his very Grooms. The Queen, her Women, Maids, Servants and all, to the very Lacqueys that attend her. When it does not rain, they Dine in the open Courts, where they rank them|&s;elves, either in a Circle, or &s;ide by &s;ide, one below ano|ther, according to their Quality. If it be cold weather they make great row&s;ing Fires in the Court where they eat; for Wood-Firing co&s;ts nothing in that Country, as I have &s;aid al|ready. When they are &s;ate down, Four Men, if the Family be great, bring upon their Shoulders a large Kettle full of <HI>Gom,</HI> or Grain boyl'd as I have already related; of which, mo&s;t u&s;u|ally a Poor beggarly half-Naked Ra&s;cal &s;erves upon a VVooden Plate, to every one his proportion, which weighs full Three Pound. Afterwards two other Servants, &s;omewhat but not much better equipp'd, bring in another Kettle full of Grain more white than the other; which is only for the better &s;ort. Upon Worky-Days they never give but only <HI>Gom</HI> to the Ser|vants, the Ma&s;ters being &s;erv'd with Pul&s;e, or dry'd Fi&s;h roa|&s;ted, or el&s;e Fle&s;h. On Holy-Days or when they make enter|tainments, they kill either a Hog, or an Ox, or a Cow, e&s;pe|cially if they have no Ven&s;on. As &s;oon as they have cut the Throat of the Bea&s;t, they dre&s;s it, and &s;et it upon the Fire, without Salt, or Sauce, in the great Kettle where they boil their Pa&s;t. VVhen it has boyl'd a while, they take it from the Fire, throw away the Broth, and &s;erve it in half-raw, without any &s;ea&s;oning. The Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e has always &s;tanding be|fore him a large Portion of this Vittles: They &s;et before him likewi&s;e all the Pul&s;e, all the Bread, and all the Tame and VVild-Fowl. VVho pre&s;ently Carves for his Gue&s;ts and his Friends their &s;hare They feed them&s;elves with their Fingers, and that &s;o na&s;tily, that nothing but extremity of hunger could provoke the meane&s;t of our Europeans to Eat at the Tables of tho&s;e Barbarians. VVhen they have begun to Eat,
<PB N="89" REF="54">
there are two Per&s;ons, that &s;erve the Drink round the Table: Among the common &s;ort, this Office is perform'd by Women or Maids. 'Tis the &s;ame Incivility among them, to call for Wine, as to refu&s;e it. For they mu&s;t &s;tay till it is pre&s;ented, and take it, when 'tis giv'n 'em. They never give le&s;s then a Pint at a Draught; which at their Ordinary Meals is thrice done; but at Fea&s;ts and Banquets, the Gue&s;ts, and the Gentry Drink on till they are Drunk.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mingrelians</HI> and their Neighbours are very Great Drinkers; far exceeding the <HI>Germans,</HI> and all the Northern People They never mix their Wine, but Drink it pure, both Men and Women. But when they are once Heated, they think their Pints too little, and therefore Drink out of their Di&s;hes, and out of the Pitcher it &s;elf. While I lay near <HI>Cotatis,</HI> I lodg'd at a Gentleman's Hou&s;e, who was one of the &s;toute&s;t Drinkers in all the Country: and while I &s;tay'd at his Hou&s;e, he made a Fea&s;t for Three of his Friends; at what time they were all Four &s;o &s;et upon Carow&s;ing, that from Ten in the Morning till Ten in the Evening, they Drank out a whole <HI>Charge</HI> of Wine, that weigh'd Three Hunderd Pound Weight. It is al&s;o a cu&s;tom among the&s;e People, practiz'd by all the World, to ri&s;e from the Table, and empty as often as they have occa&s;ion, and when they return, they &s;it down without ever Wa&s;hing their Hands. They provoke their Gue&s;ts and their Friends, as much as they can, to Drink; it being chiefly at the Table that they ob&s;erve Civility, and are free of their Complements. Their di&s;cour&s;es between Man and Man, are only Stories of their Robberies, their Wars, Duels, Mur|ders, and Selling of Slaves. Neither is their di&s;cour&s;e any bet|ter among the VVomen: for they are pleas'd with all &s;orts of Love-Tales, let 'em be never &s;o Ob&s;cene, or never &s;o La&s;ci|vious: and their Children learn their filthy VVords and Phra|&s;es, a&s;&s;oon as they can &s;peak; in&s;omuch that by that time they come to be Ten Years of Age, all their di&s;cour&s;e with the VVomen, is the mo&s;t bea&s;tly that a Brothel-Hou&s;e can utter. And certainly the Education of their Children in <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> is the mo&s;t Vicious and Lewd in the VVorld. Their Fa|ther's bring 'em up to Thievery, and their Mothers to Ob|&s;cenity.</P>
<P><HI>Mingrelia</HI> is at pre&s;ent very much di&s;peopl'd; there not be|ing in it above Twenty Thou&s;and Inhabitants. Though it is not above Thirty Years ago, that there was no le&s;s then Four|&s;core Thou&s;and. The cau&s;e of which Decrea&s;e proceeds from
<PB N="90" REF="55">
their VVars with their Neighbours, and the va&s;t number of People of both Sexes, which the Nobility have &s;old of late Years. For a long time there has been drain'd out of <HI>Mingrelia</HI> every Year, either by Purcha&s;e or Barter, above Twelve Thou|&s;and Per&s;ons; all which are &s;old to the <HI>Mahometans, Per&s;ians</HI> and <HI>Turks,</HI> there being none but they, that deal in that &s;ort of Traffic in tho&s;e parts. They carry Three Thou&s;and every Year directly to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> which they have in Exchange for Cloth, Arms, and other things which they carry, as I have &s;aid, into <HI>Mingrelia.</HI> To which purpo&s;e there came every Year Twelve Sail of Ships from <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> and <HI>Caffa,</HI> and above Sixty <HI>Feluques</HI> from <HI>Gorica, Tri&s;&s;a</HI> and <HI>Trebi&s;ond.</HI> The Com|modities which they export from <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> be&s;ides Slaves, are Silk, Linnen Thread, and Wov'n, Lin&s;eed, Hides, <HI>Martins,</HI> Bea|vers, Box, VVax and Honey. The Honey of <HI>Mingrelia</HI> is very Good; and there are two &s;orts of it, the one Red, the other White; the White is not &s;o plentiful as the other, but it is much better and more Sweet; Sweeter indeed then refin'd Sugar, very delicious to the Ta&s;t, and Crumples between the Teeth. Be&s;ides their Garden Honey, there is another &s;ort is found in the Trunks and Clefts of Hollow-Trees in great abun|dance; which the Ve&s;&s;els from <HI>Caffa</HI> carry into <HI>Tartary,</HI> where they make a very &s;trong Liquor of it, mix'd with Barley. The <HI>Turks</HI> make great profit of their <HI>Mingrelion</HI> Trade, &s;elling for Four, what they buy for one Crown; but their greate&s;t advantage is by their Slaves.</P>
<P>Certainly the Inhumanity of the&s;e <HI>Mingrelians,</HI> their unna|tural Cruelty toward their own Country Men, and particu|larly of &s;ome of 'em toward their own Fle&s;h and Blood, are things hardly to be Credited. They Study Opportunities to fall out with their own Va&s;&s;als, meerly to find a Pretence to Sell 'em, with their Wives and Children. They force away their Neighbours Children from the Embraces of their Parents, to the &s;ame end, and &s;ometimes they will &s;ell their own Chil|dren, Wives and Mothers: And I have been &s;hew'd &s;everal Gentlemen who have been &s;o Prodigiou&s;ly Unnatural. One of tho&s;e Gentlemen &s;old Twelve Prie&s;ts in one Day. In which Piece of Impiety there is one particular pa&s;&s;age &s;o &s;trange, that it de&s;erves to be related as an Example not to be Parallell'd.</P>
<P>This Gentleman fell in Love with a Lady, whom he re&s;ol|v'd to Marry, tho he had a Wife already. To which pur|po&s;e he Courted the Lady, and obtain'd her Good VVill. Now it is the Cu&s;tom in <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> to purcha&s;e their Wives,
<PB N="91" REF="55">
and they Buy 'em, according to their Quality, their Age, and their Beauty. Thereupon the Gentleman not knowing where to rai&s;e the Sum which he had promis'd for the Enjoyment of his Mi&s;tre&s;s, nor to defray the Expences of his Wedding, but by &s;elling of Slaves, and for that rea&s;on reduc'd to De&s;pair, bethought him&s;elf of a Piece of Treachery, the mo&s;t Infa|mous and VVicked that could be. To that purpo&s;e he invited Twelve Prie&s;ts to his Hou&s;e, to hear a Solemn Ma&s;s and offer a kind of Sacrifice, upon which the Prie&s;ts went very Chear|fully, never Dreaming that he intended to have &s;old 'em to the <HI>Turks,</HI> the like Practice having never been heard of before in <HI>Mingrelia.</HI> The Gentleman on the other &s;ide receiv'd 'em very Courteou&s;ly, caus'd 'em to &s;ay Ma&s;s, and to offer an Ox, and afterwards gave 'em an Entertainment. But after he had made 'em to take a Hearty Cup, he caus'd his Servants to &s;eize 'em, Bind 'em, Shave their Heads and their Beards, and the Night following carry'd 'em to a Turki&s;h Ve&s;&s;el, where he &s;old 'em for Hou&s;hold Goods, and other Nece&s;&s;aries, but finding he had not yet enough to pay for his Mi&s;tre&s;s, and his Nuptials, this Tyger went and fetch'd his own VVife, and &s;old her to the &s;ame Ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>All the Trade in <HI>Mingrelia</HI> is driv'n by way of Barter: for there is no &s;et price of Money among the People: the currant Money are the Pia&s;ters, Dutch Crowns, and <HI>Aba&s;&s;e's,</HI> which are Pieces made in <HI>Georgia,</HI> and Stamp'd with the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Stamp, to the value of Eighteen Pence every Piece. 'Tis true that the Prince of <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> who died about Twenty Years ago, be|gan to Coyn Money of his own. But the Mint did not work long, in regard there was but little Silver brought into the Country, and for that the Country produces none at all, no more then it does Gold, or any other Metal. I know not what is become of that Gold-Gravel, and Golden-Sand which the People &s;pong'd out of the VVater with their Sheep-Skins, according to the Ancient Stories, and which gave occa&s;ion to the Fable of the Golden Fleece. There is no &s;uch thing in <HI>Colchis,</HI> nor in the Mountains or Rivers adjoyning. So that which way &s;oever ye go, there is no po&s;&s;ibility of Reconciling Antiquity with the pre&s;ent Times.</P>
<P><HI>Mingrelia</HI> of it &s;elf is not able to rai&s;e above Four Thou&s;and Men, fit to bear Arms; which are al&s;o all Cavalry for the mo&s;t part; there not being above Three Hundred Foot to joyn with the&s;e Hor&s;emen. Nor are the Souldiers Mar&s;hall'd into Regiments and Companies. But every Lord, and every

Gentleman, leads his own People to the Fight, without Or|der, without Ranks, without Officers; and they follow their Leader, whether it be in Flight, or to the Charge.</P>
<P>The VVars of the <HI>Mingrelians,</HI> and their Neighbours, are indeed but meer Incur&s;ions, and <HI>Boots-Halings;</HI> and when they make their Inroads into the Enemies Country, they fall on with an Extraordinary Fury; for they want neither Cou|rage nor Re&s;olution. VVhen they have put the Enemy to Flight, they vigorou&s;ly follow the pur&s;uit, and over-run all the Country, Burn and Plunder all before 'em, carry away Pri&s;oners of all Sexes and Degrees, and then retreat with the &s;ame Impetuo&s;ity. They take as many Pri&s;oners as they can; &s;o that when they have Di&s;mounted any one, pre&s;ently they leap from their Hor&s;es, bind the Per&s;on Vanqui&s;h'd, with the Cords which they carry at their Girdles, as I have &s;aid, and deliver 'em to the Cu&s;tody of their Servants. He that has taken a Pri&s;oner, has Power over him of Life and Death, he may di&s;po&s;e of him as he plea&s;es; but generally they make 'em their Slaves, and &s;ell 'em to the <HI>Turks.</HI> On the other &s;ide, when the&s;e People are invaded, they &s;hew them&s;elves at the Ford of &s;ome River, where they lay their Musketeers in <HI>Ambu&s;cado,</HI> endeavouring to prevent the Enemies Pa&s;&s;age. At what time, if the Enemy forces his way, they fly to the VVoods, leaving the Country to their Mercy: So that the VVars with the&s;e People never la&s;t long. In le&s;s then Fifteen Days the VVar is at an end, and the Enemy retreats, after he has ravag'd, and ran&s;ackt all the Country.</P>
<P>The Revenues of the Prince of <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> amount at mo&s;t, to no more then Twenty Thou&s;and Crowns a Year. VVhich ari&s;es from the Cu&s;toms of what is Imported and Exported out of the Country, the Slaves which he &s;ells, and his Impo|&s;itions and Fines. All this he lays up; for he is not at a Far|thing Expence, for his Slaves &s;erve him for nothing, and his Crown Lands furni&s;h him with more Provi&s;ion for his Court then he can &s;pend. He often Pre&s;ents the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> with Falcons, and all &s;orts of Birds of Prey. For which the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> &s;ends him Rich Ti&s;&s;ues, Carpets, Tape&s;tries, Arms, all &s;orts of Cups and Di&s;hes, and &s;uch other Nece&s;&s;aries, of which &s;uch a beggarly Prince as the Prince of <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> may be thought to &s;tand in need. He al&s;o keeps the &s;ame Corre|&s;pondence with the <HI>Cam</HI> of <HI>Georgia.</HI> His Court upon Solemn Fe&s;tivals con&s;i&s;ts of Two Hunderd Gentlemen, upon other Days, not above Six Score.

<P>The Religion of the <HI>Colchians,</HI> has formerly as I believe, been the &s;ame with that of the <HI>Greeks.</HI> The Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi|&s;torians &s;ay, That a Slave Converted to the Chri&s;tian Faith, the King, the Queen, and all the Nobility of <HI>Colchis,</HI> in the time of <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the Great, who &s;ent both Prie&s;ts and Do|ctors to Baptize the new-Converted, and to in&s;truct 'em in the My&s;teries of Chri&s;tianity.

The <HI>Mingrelians</HI> al&s;o &s;hew ye, by the Sea &s;ide, at a Place call'd <HI>Pigivitas</HI> near the River <HI>Corax,</HI> a Church with three Bodies, which is a very large one; a&s;&s;uring ye withal, that St. <HI>Andrew</HI> Preach'd in the Place where that Church was built. I have &s;een it at a di&s;tance; and it &s;eem'd to be a very great Pile of Building &s;o far as a Man may gue&s;s a Mile off. The <HI>Catholicos</HI> once in his Life goes thither to make the Holy Oyl, which the <HI>Greeks</HI> call <HI>Mirone.</HI> I never di&s;cours'd of Re|ligion with any <HI>Mingrelian,</HI> having never found any one, that either knew what Religion, Law, Sin, the Sacraments, or Divine Service were. All I could learn was only this, That the Women &s;ometimes light up &s;mall round Candles, which they fix to the Doors of their Hou&s;es, or of &s;ome Church, where they burn at the &s;ame time a Grain of Incen&s;e and turning toward the Sun, bow their Bodies very low &s;everal times, and cro&s;s them&s;elves all over from Head to Foot.</P>
<P>The Prie&s;ts and Bi&s;hops perform the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Ceremo|nies, &s;ay Ma&s;s, and Baptize. I have &s;een 'em at the perfor|mance of their Functions, when no Body has been pre&s;ent for want of Devotion. But in regard I did not under&s;tand the Language which they &s;poke, I had rather in &s;tead of relating what I only &s;aw and heard by report, recite what I met with out of an <HI>Italian</HI> Manu&s;cript concerning the Religion of the <HI>Mingrelians</HI> and <HI>Georgians,</HI> written by Father <HI>Jo&s;eph Maria Zampi</HI> a <HI>Mantuan,</HI> Superiour of the <HI>Theatins</HI> in <HI>Mingrelia.</HI> For that Fryer who made me a Pre&s;ent of the Manu&s;cript, had liv'd there Twenty Three Years, and could not be ignorant either of their Ceremonies or their Belief: which made him write at large his own knowledge of the <HI>Mingrelian</HI> Piety. And this is that which he &s;peaks more particularly, and as it lies in the Manu&s;cript.</P>

The <HI>Mingrelians,</HI> &s;ays he, are fall'n into the profounde&s;t Aby&s;s of Ignorance and Darkne&s;s, that the Under&s;tanding of Man was ever plung'd in: in regard the people have not the lea&s;t <HI>Idea</HI> of Faith or Religion; while the mo&s;t part look upon Life Eternal, the Day of Judgment, and the Re&s;urrection of the Dead, to be meer Fables, and Humane Invention. Nor do the Clergy perform any Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Duties, there being hard|ly one of the whole Heard, that can either Write or Read. They have utterly lo&s;t the Knowledge of the true &s;ervice of God: only the Prie&s;ts make a publick profe&s;&s;ion of foretelling things to come, and make the people believe that their Books do &s;hew 'em the &s;ucce&s;s of future Events. With which Im|po&s;ture the <HI>Mingrelians</HI> are &s;o ob&s;tinately bewitch'd that when any one falls &s;ick, they call the Prie&s;ts, not to make Confe&s;|&s;ion of their Sins, or to Recommend their Souls to their Pray|ers, which is the lea&s;t thing that troubles the <HI>Patient,</HI> but to bid 'em look in their Books, and &s;ee whether he &s;hall die of that Di&s;temper or no; to tell 'em the event and &s;ucce&s;s of it, and what was the rea&s;on that he was vi&s;ited with that Sick|ne&s;s. Pre&s;ently the Prie&s;t falls to turning over the Leaves of his Book which he carries along with him, and after he has turn'd 'em over and over, and over and over again, he pro|nounces with the Voice of an Oracle, That &s;uch a <HI>Cati</HI> (for &s;o the <HI>Mingrelians</HI> call their Images) is angry with him, and has therefore &s;truck'n him with that Di&s;ea&s;e; nor will he be appeas'd without a good Pre&s;ent, which if he do not &s;end forthwith, the Image will certainly ruine him. Which Pre|&s;ent is to be either a Pig, or a Goat, or an Ox, or el&s;e Ready Money. The poor &s;ick per&s;on upon this, being dreadfully afraid of death, fails not immediately to give the Prie&s;ts what they appoint for an Offering to the Idol, who divide the &s;poil among them&s;elves; and in that manner couzen the poor &s;ick per&s;on.</P>
<P>The <HI>Catholicos</HI> of <HI>Mingrelia</HI> is the Head of all the Clergy of that Country, of the <HI>Abca</HI>'s, of <HI>Guriel,</HI> of <HI>Mount Cauca&s;us,</HI> and <HI>Imiretta.</HI> Whom the Prince of <HI>Mingrelia</HI> appoints and depo&s;es as he plea&s;es him&s;elf. His Revenue is very great, as having Four Hunderd Va&s;&s;als under him, who furni&s;h his Hou&s;e with all Things nece&s;&s;ary for Human Life, and many other Super|fluities. He &s;ells their Childern to the <HI>Turks</HI> be&s;ides, and as it is his Imployment to vi&s;it the Dioce&s;&s;es under his Juri&s;diction, he vi&s;its em indeed, but it is not for the good of his Flock, to in&s;truct the people, or to examine the Mi&s;carriages of the In|feriour

Clergy: Tho&s;e Cares never trouble his Brains nor his Thoughts; but his main bu&s;ine&s;s is, to rake Money together, to &s;uck the Blood of the poor people, and di&s;poil 'em of what they have. And as to the Train that attends this <HI>Catholicos</HI> when he makes his Vi&s;itations, it con&s;i&s;ts of no le&s;s then Two Hunderd per&s;ons.</P>
<P>The outward Sanctity of this Pontiff con&s;i&s;ts in a continual ab&s;tinence from Fle&s;h, and Wine only during Lent; and in long Prayers Day and Night. He is &s;o ignorant that he can hardly read his <HI>Breviary</HI> and <HI>Mi&s;&s;al.</HI> And there is &s;o much to be &s;aid concerning his Simony, that it would be a difficult task to make a true recital of it. I &s;hall therefore &s;ay no more then this, That he never Con&s;ecrates a Bi&s;hop for le&s;s then Six Hun|derd Crowns; that he never &s;ays Ma&s;s for the Dead, under Eight Hunderd; nor any other Ma&s;&s;es under a Hunderd Crowns a Piece. Not long &s;ince the Prince of <HI>Mingrelia</HI>'s Vi|zier, being &s;ick, made his Confe&s;&s;ion to him, and gave him Fifty Crowns. Which the <HI>Catholicos</HI> took for &s;o &s;mall a Re|muneration, that upon the Vizier's falling &s;ick again, and &s;ending for him to make a new Confe&s;&s;ion, he &s;ent him word, that he &s;hould pay for his fir&s;t Confe&s;&s;ion, and then he would come and hear what he had to &s;ay.</P>
<P>There are Six Bi&s;hops in <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> but tho&s;e Prelates take no care of the Souls of their Flocks, nor do they ever vi&s;it their Churches, or their Dioce&s;&s;es. They &s;uffer the Prie&s;ts to live in all manner of Errours, and the People to pro&s;titute them&s;elves to all manner of Vices; they under&s;tand not the Form of Bapti&s;m: they let Polygamy Raign, and permit the Mothers to Bury their new Born Childern alive. And tho they have been often reprov'd for &s;o much Cruelty more then Barbarous; Remon&s;trances operate nothing upon 'em; this Inhumanity being become a Cu&s;tom. The Clergy tolerates it, and the Prince near Prohibits any one that plea&s;es, from putting it in practi&s;e. The chief Imployments of the Bi&s;hops, is continual Fea&s;ting and Banqueting, where they are Drunk almo&s;t every Day: they are Rich and go Sumptuou&s;l-y Habi|ted; their Principal Revenue ari&s;ing from what they Spunge from their Va&s;&s;als, and the price of the Women and Children, which they &s;ell to the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>They ab&s;tain from Fle&s;h, after the manner of the <HI>Greek</HI> Bi&s;hops, and include the whole Chri&s;tian Religion, within the practi&s;e of Fa&s;ting. They do not believe them&s;elves oblig'd to any other Duty; but believe them&s;elves acquitted of all the
<PB N="96" REF="58">
Precepts of Chri&s;tianity, by Fa&s;ting. Their Cathedral Church is indifferent neatly kept, and well adorn'd with Images, after the <HI>Grecian</HI> manner, dre&s;s'd up and finifi'd with Gold and Jewels. They believe that in Beautifying their Images they &s;ati&s;fie the Ju&s;tice of God, and that the offering of a Jewel, to an Image wipes away all their Sins. And this is the way which they take, when they have offended them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Their Apparel is very Magnificent, con&s;idering the Country, being of Scarlet and Velvet. It differs little from the &s;ecular Habit. That which makes the peculiar di&s;tinction between 'em, is the long Beard which they wear, with a black Bonnet, Round and High, made after the Fa&s;hion of the <HI>Greek</HI> Monks. They wear Chains of Gold about their Necks, go a Hunting, and many times to the Warrs, where they Fight no le&s;s Cou|ragiou&s;ly at the Head of their Slaves, then the Gentry and Noble-Men. There are &s;ome of 'em that are never Con&s;e|crated, which neverthele&s;s does not hinder 'em from be&s;towing Orders, as if they were Con&s;ecrated.</P>
<P>There are in <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> certain Monks of the Order of St. <HI>Ba&s;il,</HI> which they call <HI>Berres,</HI> who wear the &s;ame Habit as the <HI>Greek</HI> Monks, and ob&s;erve the &s;ame manner of living. And a Child may be made one of the&s;e Monks by his Father and Mother only. They Con&s;ecrate him in his Infancy, by put|ting a black Bonnet upon his Head, &s;uffering his Hair to grow, hindering him from eating Fle&s;h, and telling him upon all oc|ca&s;ions that he is a <HI>Berre.</HI> All this while the Infant under|&s;tands nothing more what belongs to his Condition, and all his Life long never minds any thing el&s;e but to ob&s;erve his Fa&s;ts as others that bear the &s;ame Title with him&s;elf.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o Nuns of the &s;ame Order, who ob&s;erve Fa&s;t|ing Days, and wear a black Vail; but they have neither Nun|neries, neither are they under any Vows or Subordination. They that have taken upon 'em to wear the Vail of Sanctity, and to ob&s;erve Fa&s;ting, when they are weary of well-doing, quit their Habit and their Temperance, when they plea&s;e them&s;elves: For that &s;ame manner of living is wholly at their own di&s;cre|tions, whether they be Maids, Wives or VVidows; whether Divorc'd, whether Free or Slaves; no Condition is exempted from that Liberty.</P>
<P>The Prie&s;ts of <HI>Mingrelia</HI> are very numerous; and a &s;ort of mi&s;erable Creatures that live upon whatever they can get, and marry again as often as they plea&s;e them&s;elves. There needs no more then to be able to read and &s;ay a Ma&s;s by Heart, to
<PB N="97" REF="58">
be admitted into the Prie&s;thood For the Bi&s;hop never exa|mines tho&s;e that he admits into Orders, being many times more ignorant then they: e&s;pecially if the Prie&s;t that de&s;ires to be admitted gives him the Value of a Hor&s;e for his Ordina|tion. God alone knows the lamentable Condition of tho&s;e Mi&s;erable Prie&s;ts, and the Validity of their Prie&s;thood; for many times it is a great Que&s;tion, whether they are Baptiz'd, and whether the Bi&s;hops that Ordain 'em, were ever Baptiz'd or Con&s;ecrated them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Nor is it to be imagin'd how the&s;e Prie&s;ts are contemn'd and &s;corn'd. They Till their own, and the Lands of their Lords, being no le&s;s Slaves then the Seculars; they follow 'em to the Wars, and carry their Baggage. Now that which cau&s;es this Contempt is their Ignorance, their Gluttony and their Poverty. Their Poverty is &s;o great, that they go Barefoot, and all in Tattars that hardly cover their Tails. So that there is no re&s;pect giv'n 'em but when they are &s;ate down at Table; for then they are the fir&s;t to whom they offer Drink; and they de&s;ire 'em to ble&s;s the Wine and the Food when they &s;ay Ma&s;s; and at another time when they are &s;ent for to vi&s;it the Sick, and turn over their Books to know what Image the &s;ick Party has offended, and what Pre&s;ent will appea&s;e him. They are only di&s;tingui&s;h'd from the Seculars by their Beards, which they let grow very long: for the Seculars wear hardly any at all.</P>
<P>There are but few of their Churches which have any Bells, but they call the people together by knocking with a good big Stick upon a Board. The Images in the Cathedrals are very well dre&s;s'd; being encircl'd by the Offerings of the people, &s;uch as are Harts Horns, Boars Jaws and Tusks, Phea|&s;ants Wings, and Weapons, to the end the Image &s;hould pro&s;per 'em in their Hunting and Wars</P>
<P>The Pari&s;h-Churches are more Na&s;ty then Stables; the Images mangl'd and brok'n, and cover'd over with Du&s;t and Spiders. Their <HI>Sanctum Sanctorum</HI> is &s;o Na&s;ty that I am a&s;ham'd to &s;peak it. The Ornaments of the Altar are nothing but a few Na&s;ty Tatter'd Clouts, torn and &s;tain'd with Wine. Their Cup or Chalice is a Goblet of Wood as Na&s;ty as may well be imagin'd; and the Cover of the Chalice is a Woodden Plate, as Na&s;ty and as Grea&s;ie as the Chalice. When they have occa&s;ion they wipe it with the Curtain of the <HI>Sanctum Sanctorum,</HI> which is yet more Na&s;ty then all that has been &s;aid; and I &s;ay the le&s;s, becau&s;e I would not offend the Rea|der. But the Cathedrals are very clean and well adorn'd.
<PB N="98" REF="59">
And I could wi&s;h, that every Bi&s;hop had as much care of the Education and In&s;truction of his Flock, as he has of the Clean|&s;ing and Adorning his Church.</P>
<P>The Wor&s;hip which they pay to their Images, is an Ido|latrous Wor&s;hip. For they adore 'em not with a Relative Adoration, but pay their Devotion to the Material Sub&s;tance and Figure before their Eyes. The Images which are the fair|e&s;t, are the be&s;t &s;erv'd, and mo&s;t devoutly ador'd: e&s;peci|ally tho&s;e that are adorn'd with any thing that is co&s;tly, as Gold; tho&s;e that have mo&s;t Jewels and Pretious Stones; but above all tho&s;e that are reputed to be Cruel, ea&s;ily Provok'd, and apt to Kill tho&s;e again&s;t whom they are Incens'd. Which latter are &s;erv'd with an incredible re&s;pect: For the People throw them&s;elves to the Ground, as far off as they can &s;ee the Church that contains tho&s;e Images; thump their Bre&s;ts, and be&s;eech 'em to Kill their Enemies, and &s;uch as have Robb'd 'em of any thing. They are Horribly afraid to &s;wear by tho&s;e re|ver'd Images, and when they do, there is no gain&s;aying &s;uch an Oath. For they believe whatever is &s;worn by tho&s;e Ima|ges. Some there are that will not call the&s;e Images to Wit|ne&s;s the mo&s;t certain Truths, for fear of being Kill'd by 'em; and they that do Swear, Swear only by tho&s;e that have a plea|&s;ing, mild, &s;miling Countenance, and are reputed neither Murderers nor Bloody-Minded.</P>
<P>Nor do they Wor&s;hip the&s;e Images in hopes of any Spiri|tual Advantages, or to obtain any A&s;&s;i&s;tance in order to a fu|ture Life: For the <HI>Mingrelians</HI> acknowledge no other Life but their Pre&s;ent Being. And all that they do is meerly out of a Terrible and Servile fear, le&s;t the Images &s;houid deprive 'em of their Lives, or Vex 'em with Di&s;ea&s;es, deliver 'em over with their Goods, into the Hands of Thieves and Robbers, or the Fury of their Ma&s;ters, or &s;uffer 'em to be made Slaves to the <HI>Turks.</HI> When they have been Robb'd at any time, they go to the Church where &s;tands the Image in which they have mo&s;t Confidence, make it a pre&s;ent of two Loaves, and a Bottle of Wine, bow &s;everal times to it; and having driven a Stake in|to the Earth before it, they Pray to it in this manner. <HI>Thou know'&s;t, O Image, that I have been Robb'd of &s;uch and &s;uch Goods, and that I cannot di&s;cover the Thief, which has prov'd &s;o great a Grief to me, that I come here to make my Prayers to thee, and I offer thee this Pre&s;ent, to the end thou may&s;t take away their Lives, exterminate 'em from the Earth, and fa&s;ten 'em down in the Aby&s;s, as I have driv'n this Stake into the Earth before</HI>

<HI>thee.</HI> The Prie&s;t being pre&s;ent at all this Ceremony, takes the Offering, and having hung it about the Head of the Suppliant, they go and Eat it together.

Giobas.</HI> They relate how this Image being one day carry'd a Journey, and pa&s;&s;ing by a Lake or Mar&s;h full of Frogs, the noi&s;e of the Frogs &s;o amaz'd it, and put it into &s;uch a Fury, that it flew away to a Church that &s;tood upon a Mountain. They report moreover, that it Kills all that approach too near it. So that when any Per&s;on has oc|ca&s;ion to Pray to it, he goes no nearer then ju&s;t within &s;ight. Where he throws his Pre&s;ent down at a di&s;tance, and keeps him&s;elf at the &s;ame di&s;tance all the while he makes his Prayer. The <HI>Mingrelians</HI> are al&s;o every one very Zealous for the Ho|nour and Bravery of his Pari&s;h-Idol; every one vaunting the Exploits of the Idol he Wor&s;hips, and how Couragiou&s;ly it has reveng'd him upon his Enemies: or how &s;peedily they die that fall under its disfavour! But to the Images of the <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> the <HI>Mingrelians</HI> pay not the lea&s;t Venerati|on, nor have they any value for 'em.

<P>They have &s;everal Reliques among 'em, of which the chiefe&s;t were brought 'em as they &s;ay, by the Prelates that fled for Shelter into tho&s;e parts, when <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> was taken by the <HI>Turks;</HI> fearing le&s;t they &s;hould fall into the Hands of the Infidels.

For the <HI>Mingrelians</HI> have a greater
<PB N="100" REF="60">
E&s;teem for the Encha&s;ements, then for the Reliques them|&s;elves. But as for the Reliques they have little or no Value for 'em, but handle 'em very contemptibly.</P>
<P>Their Ma&s;s is after the <HI>Greek</HI> manner, which the Prie&s;ts Celebrate, without any other Sacerdotal Habit, then only in their Surplices. And if they have no Shooes, they lay a Piece of a Wooden Plank before the Altar to &s;tand upon. If the Prie&s;t comes to the Hou&s;e of any one that de&s;ires a Ma&s;s, the good natur'd Prie&s;t never troubles him&s;elf to go to the Church to &s;ay it; but pre&s;ently repairs to the place where the Wine lies, and takes the fir&s;t Plank that he meets with, tho never &s;o Durty or Du&s;ty, to &s;erve him in &s;tead of an Altar; then he Borrows an Old Shirt, or &s;ome other piece of Linnen, to put about his Shoulders, and orders a little Dough to be giv'n, of which he makes a little Cake, and Bakes it in the Cinders. After that he takes a Wooden Cup, and a Di&s;h for a Chalice and Cover, tho never &s;o Grea&s;y and Na&s;ty; which he wipes with his Hands in &s;tead of a Towel; and then &s;ays Ma&s;s with|out Book. For the Mi&s;&s;al of the <HI>Mingrelians</HI> is a little Book Written in the <HI>Georgian</HI> Language: and &s;everal Prie&s;ts carry about 'em the&s;e Mi&s;&s;als, all torn or Dog's-Ear'd, and &s;ome|times here a Leaf and there a Leaf torn out, and altogether imperfect. But this never troubles 'em. They &s;ay Ma&s;s all the while they are Looking for it in the <HI>Mi&s;&s;al,</HI> and many times they have done before they can find it: for as I &s;aid be|fore, they have it by Heart. Nor is the Office perform'd with any Decency i' the World. For many times, they talk all the while of other matters. During Lent, they never &s;ay Ma&s;s, but <HI>Saturdays</HI> and <HI>Sundays,</HI> for that all the other Days it be|hoves 'em to Fa&s;t; and it is an Opinion among 'em that the Communion &s;poils their Fa&s;ting.</P>
<P>They Con&s;ecrate Unleaven'd as well as Leaven'd Bread, without any difference; nor do they ever mix any Water in the Chalice, unle&s;s the Wine be very &s;trong. For they hold that the Communion may be giv'n in Vinegar, as well as in Wine. I enquir'd of &s;everal Prie&s;ts (I &s;till recite the words of the Manu&s;cript) concerning the Form of their Con&s;ecration; but I never could meet with above one that could tell me. Him I ask'd, Whether after Con&s;ecration, the Bread and VVine were Sub&s;tantially the Body and Blood of Chri&s;t? Upon which the <HI>Mingrelian</HI> Prie&s;t fell a Laughing, as if I had &s;poken to him in Raillery. VVhat, &s;aid he, is there any one that can put Chri&s;t in a Loaf? VVhich way could he get into it? How is it po&s;&s;ible
<PB N="101" REF="60">
he &s;hould be contain'd in &s;uch a little piece of Bread? What rea&s;on &s;hould move him to leave Heav'n and de&s;cend to Earth? I never heard the like of the Que&s;tion that you ask. Then I ask'd him, Whether the Ma&s;s were effectual without the words of Con&s;ecration? To which he an&s;wer'd, That the Ma&s;s was certainly effectual without 'em, yet that the <HI>Prie&s;t</HI> who did not pronounce the words of Con&s;ecration, did very ill. But as for the Intention of Con&s;ecration requi&s;ite in him that Con&s;ecrates, that's a thing of which the <HI>Mingrelian Prie&s;ts</HI> know nothing at all.</P>
<P>They make their <HI>Viaticum</HI> Bread once a Year; that is to &s;ay, upon <HI>Holy Thur&s;day.</HI> Which they keep in a Pur&s;e of Lea|ther or Linnen that hangs fa&s;ten'd to their Girdles. But they have no more Veneration for this <HI>Viaticum,</HI> then for a Mor&s;el of any other Vittles. As for example, when they go to Bed, they lay it under the Bol&s;ter with the re&s;t of their Furniture, and when a &s;ick Per&s;on &s;ends for any of this <HI>Viaticum,</HI> they open the Pur&s;e, and take out a piece, and give it the Me&s;&s;en|ger for the u&s;e of the Per&s;on that wants it, whether Man, Woman or Child. And becau&s;e this <HI>Viaticum</HI> is u&s;ually very dry, they break it with their Hands upon a Stone, or in a Plat|ter, never minding to gather up the Bits or Crums that fall to the Ground; which afterwards they put into a Draught of Wine, and give it the &s;ick. At the Years end the <HI>Prie&s;t</HI> emp|ties out of his Pur&s;e upon the Altar the remainder of the <HI>Via|ticum,</HI> if there be any left; where generally the Mice come and eat it. By which you may conjecture what is the Opi|nion and Belief which the <HI>Mingrelians</HI> have of the Holy Sacra|ments.</P>
<P>They anoint the Foreheads of their Children &s;o &s;oon as they are born, and the Oyl which they make u&s;e of for this pur|po&s;e is call'd <HI>Myrone.</HI> But they are not Baptiz'd till a long time after: nor does any one Baptize his Child, until he be in a Capacity to make a Fea&s;t after the Ceremony is over; which is the rea&s;on that many Childern die, without being ever Baptiz'd. And when they do perform the Ceremony, they never carry the Child to the Church, but into a Cellar or Vault, where the <HI>Prie&s;t</HI> &s;its down without minding to put on his Sacerdotal Habit, and reads a good while in a Book; which being ended, the Godfather &s;trips the Child, wa&s;hes him all over with Water, and then rubs him from Head to Foot; which done, he dre&s;&s;es the Child again, and gives it to eat. And then the Prie&s;t, the Father, the Godfather, and the Gue&s;ts invited,
<PB N="102" REF="61">
&s;it down at the Table. There is not one Prie&s;t among 'em all that under&s;tands the Form of Bapti&s;m, &s;o that 'tis a Que|&s;tion whether their Bapti&s;m be to any purpo&s;e or no. Which is the rea&s;on that our <HI>Theatin</HI> Monks Baptize as many Chil|dern as they can: which they generally do under the pretence of &s;ome Phy&s;ical Application: by that means concealing the Office of the Prie&s;thood under the di&s;gui&s;e of Phy&s;ical Ope|ration.</P>
<P>There are very few People in <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> whether Eccle&s;i|a&s;tical or Seculars, that make any Confe&s;&s;ions: and I think I might well &s;ay there are none at all. For they believe it to be a &s;ufficient Satisfaction for their Sins to offer a Pre&s;ent to their Idols, which is the utmo&s;t addre&s;s of their Wor&s;hip, and limit of their Religion. They never make u&s;e of Extream Unction, which is a thing of which they are utterly ignorant. They do not believe that Ordination imprints a Character not to be defac'd. And therefore they Ordain anew tho&s;e who have been degraded, as if they had never been in Or|ders.</P>
<P>They do not allow Marriage to be in the Number of the Sacraments. 'Tis a Contract by way of Bargain and Sale; for the Parents of the Maid agree upon the price which the per&s;on that demands her in Marriage is to give for her. The price of a Woman repudiated is le&s;s, then that of a VVi|dow; and the price of a VVidow le&s;s then that of a Maid. VVhen the Match is concluded, the Party concern'd makes it his Bu&s;ine&s;s to rai&s;e the Sum agreed upon for the purcha&s;e of his Mi&s;tre&s;s: which he rai&s;es by the Sale of his Subjects if he have any, or their Childern to the <HI>Turks,</HI> either for Ready Money or Commodities. However, while he is rai&s;ing the Sum, he has Liberty to go privately and &s;ee his Mi&s;tre&s;s; nor is it any &s;candal if her Belly &s;well before &s;he is married. At length when the Young Man has rais'd the Sum agreed upon by the Parents, he carries it to 'em: and that Day they make a great Fea&s;t together, and that is the fir&s;t Day of the Nuptials. The next Day the Parents Conduct the Bride to the Bride|groom's Hou&s;e: and u&s;ually give him either in Slaves, Cattle or Hou&s;hold-Goods the value they have receiv'd from him: and upon the fourth or fifth of the&s;e Fea&s;ting Days the Cere|mony is concluded, according to the Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Greek</HI> Church, only in this, that the Ceremony is perform'd not in the Church, but over the Door. But if any one have mar|ry'd a Barren VVoman, or of an ill Di&s;po&s;ition and ugly Hu|mour,
<PB N="103" REF="61">
they hold it not only lawful, but requi&s;ite to Divorce her; in regard it was no Match of Gods making, for that God does always that which is good, and never makes Matches between people that are Barren, or who&s;e Humours are in|compatible one with another.</P>
<P>There is not a Man among 'em that under&s;tands the Bible, or that reads it; there being very few among 'em that can read or under&s;tand the <HI>Georgian;</HI> which is the only Language wherein they have the Holy Scripture written. But as for the VVomen, they are not altogether &s;o ignorant as the Men; &s;o that you &s;hall have &s;ome of them who will rehear&s;e &s;everal Stories of the Go&s;pel, which they have read and got by Heart.</P>
<P>Their Fa&s;ts are almo&s;t the &s;ame which the <HI>Greeks</HI> ob&s;erve. For they ob&s;erve the four great <HI>Lents;</HI> The fir&s;t before <HI>Ea&s;ter,</HI> being 48 Days; That before <HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI> which la&s;ts 40 Days; That which is call'd St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Fa&s;t, which holds very near a Month; and the la&s;t which the <HI>Oriental</HI> Chri&s;tians ob&s;erve in Honour of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> which continues for 15 Days.</P>
<P>They make the Sign of the Cro&s;s upon certain Occa&s;ions, but they do not believe the Sign of the Cro&s;s to be any Mark of Chri&s;tianity. Only they make this Sign when they drink VVine and eat Pork. Their Prayers are all addre&s;s'd to their Idols, relating only to Temporal Benefits, their own Pro&s;pe|rity, and the Ruine of their Enemies.</P>
<P>They offer Sacrifices like the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles.</HI> The <HI>Prie&s;t</HI> prays over the Victim, and then cuts the Throat of it: And when it is Boyl'd, they &s;et it upon the Table. At what time all the people of the Family &s;tand about it with Candles in their Hands, except the per&s;on who makes the Offering, who is Kneeling all the while. He fir&s;t perfumes the Victim with Incen&s;e; which when the re&s;t have likewi&s;e done, they fall too, and eat it altogether. They al&s;o cut the Throats of Bea&s;ts and Birds over the Graves of their Relations and Friends, and pour VVine and Oyl upon 'em. And the&s;e Libations they ob&s;erve every day. No Body drinks, till as he holds the Cup in his Hand, he has fir&s;t &s;aid a &s;entence of a Prayer, with his Eyes lifted up to Heav'n, and pouring out at the &s;ame time upon the Ground a &s;mall quantity of the VVine in the Cup.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="62">
They never make Holy-Day upon <HI>Sundays,</HI> or ab&s;tain from Work, but upon the Fe&s;tivals of <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> and Ea&s;ter. However the celebration of their great Fe&s;tivals con&s;i&s;ts only in Eating and Drinking to exce&s;s in their Hou&s;es. Their greate&s;t Fe&s;tivals which they ob&s;erve is, when any Idol is to be carry'd through their Country. Then they put on all the be&s;t Cloaths they have. They make a great Fea&s;t, and get ready a Pre|&s;ent for the Idol which is to pa&s;s by.</P>
<P>And this, I believe, may &s;uffice to &s;hew that there is not the lea&s;t &s;hadow of Religion among the <HI>Mingrelians.</HI> The Ma|nu&s;cript, from whence I took the&s;e ob&s;ervations, relates their &s;everal &s;orts of Divination practiz'd among 'em; their Super|&s;titions and Sundry Cu&s;tomes, which are a Medley of Judai&s;m, and Pagani&s;m. All which I left behind me, not finding therein the lea&s;t Grain of Wit or common Sence. But quite the Contra|ry, nothing but Extravagance. I &s;hall only add, that all that I ob&s;erv'd in the Religious Ceremonies and Belief or Faith of the <HI>Mingrelians,</HI> is no other then what I have truly re|ported.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only &s;peak a word concerning their Mourning, which is the Mourning of people in de&s;pair. When a Woman lo&s;es her Husband, or a near Relation, &s;he rends her Cloaths, &s;trips her &s;elf naked to the Wa&s;te, tears her Hair, and with her Nails claws off the Fle&s;h and Skin from her Body and Face, &s;he beats her Brea&s;t, &s;he crys, yells, gna&s;hes her Teeth, foams at Mouth, like a Woman mad or po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, and acts her pa&s;&s;ion to that degree, that it &s;eems terrible to the &s;ight. The Men al&s;o ex|pre&s;s their Grief after a manner altogether as Barbarous: They tear their Cloaths, thump their Brea&s;ts, and &s;have their Heads and their Beards. This Mourning continues 40 Days, with the &s;ame Fury as I have de&s;crib'd for the fir&s;t Ten Days, but afterwards relaxing by degrees. During the fir&s;t Ten Days, the Relations of the deceas'd, and a great Number of Men and Women come to bewail the Dead, which they do in this manner. The people range them&s;elves in order about the dead Corps, and in their torn Habits, thump their Brea&s;ts with both Hands; crying out <HI>Vah, Vah;</HI> and &s;o keeping time with their Thumps and their Cries, they make a di&s;mal Noi&s;e; which altogether yields a frightful Spectacle of de|&s;pair, not to be beheld without a kind of Horrour. Of a &s;udden you hear nothing, all's quiet, the Mourning &s;tops, and all ob&s;erve a profound Silence; By and by they all begin again with a loud Cry, and fall into their fir&s;t Tran&s;portments.
<PB N="105" REF="62">
The la&s;t Day, which is the Fortieth, they Bury the Dead. Then they make a Fea&s;t for all their Relations, all their Friends, all their Neighbours, and all tho&s;e that came to bewail the Party deceas'd; the Women eating by them&s;elves, apart from the Men. The Bi&s;hop &s;ays Ma&s;s, and then &s;eizes as his Right, upon all that the Deceas'd Per&s;on made u&s;e of in his Life, his Hor&s;e, his Cloaths, his Weapons, his Plate if he have any, and all the re&s;t of that &s;ort. So that the&s;e Mournings ruine whole Families in <HI>Mingrelia.</HI> Neverthele&s;s they are ob|lig'd to this Solemn Performance. The Bi&s;hop &s;ays a <HI>Ma&s;s</HI> for the Dead, for the great profit he receives; and the Mourners come to waile the Deceas'd, as &s;ure to live Forty Days upon what he has left behind. When a Bi&s;hop dies the Prince him|&s;elf cau&s;es Ma&s;s to be &s;aid upon the Forti'th Day, and &s;eizes upon all his Goods that are Moveable.</P>
<P>This is all that I could learn in <HI>Colchis,</HI> concerning the Na|ture of the Country, and the Cu&s;toms and Religion of the In|habitants. Their Neighbours Live and act after the &s;ame Fa|&s;hion, almo&s;t in every re&s;pect: only they who Live nearer to <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Turkey,</HI> are more Civil in their Manners, and more Hone&s;t and Ju&s;t in their Inclinations Whereas they who lie nearer the <HI>Tartars</HI> and <HI>Scythians,</HI> are more Barbarous in their Cu&s;toms, living without any <HI>Idea</HI> or outward Form of Reli|gion, or ob&s;ervance of any Laws. I have &s;poken al&s;o of the <HI>Abca</HI>'s and other People that Live at the Foot of Mount <HI>Cau|ca&s;us;</HI> concerning whom I have related as much as I could learn. But now I &s;hall give an accompt of what I have &s;een and heard, mo&s;t remarkable, concerning tho&s;e other Countries that bor|der upon <HI>Mingrelia.</HI> VVhich are the Principality of <HI>Guriel,</HI> and the Kingdom of <HI>Imiretta.</HI></P>
<P>The Country of <HI>Guriel</HI> is very &s;mall; it Borders to the North upon <HI>Imiretta;</HI> Ea&s;tward upon a part of Mount <HI>Cauca|&s;us</HI> that belongs to the <HI>Turks.</HI> To the VVe&s;t upon <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> and to the South upon the <HI>Black-Sea.</HI> It lies all along upon that Sea in length from the River <HI>Pha&s;is,</HI> that runs a Mile from the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Gonie,</HI> held by the <HI>Turks,</HI> di&s;tant only Forty Miles from <HI>Pha&s;is.</HI> The Country of <HI>Guriel</HI> re&s;embles <HI>Min|grelia</HI> in every thing as to its Nature and the Manners of the Inhabitants. For they have the &s;ame Religion, the &s;ame Cu&s;toms; and the &s;ame Inclinations to Leudne&s;s, Robbery and Murder.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="63">
The Kingdom of <HI>Imiretta</HI> is &s;omewhat bigger then the Country of <HI>Guriel;</HI> and is the <HI>Hiberia</HI> of the Ancients. It is Enclos'd and Surrounded by Mount <HI>Cauca&s;us, Colchis,</HI> the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI> the Principality of <HI>Guriel,</HI> and <HI>Georgia:</HI> being about Six and Twenty Miles in Length, and Sixty Miles broad. The People of Mount <HI>Cauca&s;us</HI> that lie next to it, are the <HI>Georgians</HI> and <HI>Turks,</HI> and to the North the <HI>O&s;&s;i</HI> and <HI>Caracioles,</HI> or <HI>Caracherks</HI> or <HI>Black-Circa&s;&s;ians,</HI> &s;o call'd by the <HI>Turks,</HI> for the rea&s;ons already mention'd. The&s;e are tho&s;e <HI>Caracioles</HI> or <HI>Black-Circa&s;&s;ians,</HI> which the <HI>Europeans</HI> call <HI>Huns,</HI> who ran|&s;ackt <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Gaul,</HI> and who&s;e deva&s;tations in tho&s;e Countries, are &s;o frequently mention'd by the Ancient Hi&s;torians, and par|ticularly by <HI>Cedrenus.</HI> The Language which they &s;peak is al|mo&s;t half Turki&s;h.</P>
<P><HI>Imiretta</HI> is a Country full of Woods and Mountains like <HI>Mingrelia;</HI> but the Vallies are more Lovely, and the Plains more Delicious; where you may meet much more ea&s;ily with Bread, Meat, Pul&s;e and Herbs of all &s;orts. There are al&s;o in it &s;ome Iron-Mines. Money goes among the People of this Country, and is Coyn'd in the Kingdom; and here ye al&s;o meet with &s;everal Towns. But as for their Manners and Cu|&s;tomes, they are the &s;ame as in <HI>Mingrelia.</HI> The King has Three good Ca&s;tles; one call'd <HI>Scander,</HI> &s;eated upon the &s;ide of a Valley, and two in Mount <HI>Cauca&s;us,</HI> call'd <HI>Regia</HI> and <HI>Scorgia,</HI> both almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible; as being built in places that Nature her &s;elf has ingeniou&s;ly fortifi'd; the River <HI>Pha&s;is</HI> run|ning before 'em. The Prince had al&s;o not long &s;ince another For|tre&s;s call'd <HI>Cotatis,</HI> bearing the &s;ame Name as the Country round about it, which perhaps may be the &s;ame place that <HI>Ptolomy</HI> calls the Region of <HI>Cotatene.</HI> But the <HI>Turks</HI> are at pre&s;ent Ma&s;ters of it.</P>
<P>The Kingdom of <HI>Imiretta,</HI> has had under its Juri&s;diction the <HI>Abca</HI>'s, the <HI>Mingrelians,</HI> and the People of <HI>Guriel,</HI> after they had all Four &s;haken off the Yoke of the Emperors of <HI>Con|&s;tantinople</HI> fir&s;t of all, and then of the Emperors of <HI>Trebi|&s;ond.</HI> But then in the la&s;t Age, &s;etting up for them&s;elves, and revolting one from another, they have been ever &s;ince at continual Wars one with the other. They who lay next the <HI>Turks</HI> implor'd their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, who readily took 'em into their Protection, and then made 'em all Tributaries one after ano|ther. The Tribute of the King of <HI>Imiretta</HI> is Four&s;core Boys and Girls, from Ten to Twenty Years of Age. The Prince of <HI>Guriel</HI> pays Six and Forty Children of both Sexes; and the
<PB N="107" REF="63">
Prince of <HI>Mingrelia</HI> Sixty Thou&s;and Ells of Linnen Cloath, made in the Country. The <HI>Abca</HI>'s al&s;o were made Tributary, but they &s;eldom pay'd any thing; and now they pay nothing. The King of <HI>Imiretta,</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Guriel,</HI> &s;end their Tribute to the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of <HI>Akalzike:</HI> but a <HI>Chiaux</HI> gathers it in <HI>Mingrelia.'</HI> When I came to <HI>Akalzike,</HI> the report went, that the <HI>Turks</HI> would take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e Countries, under the Government of a <HI>Ba&s;ha,</HI> not knowing any other way to prevent the perpetual Wars, that apparently ruine and de|populate the Countries. However it be now, the <HI>Turks</HI> formerly forbore to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, in regard that the Precepts of Mahumati&s;m, could not conveniently be there ob|&s;erv'd, becau&s;e the be&s;t nouri&s;hment in tho&s;e Countries is their Wine and their Hogs Fle&s;h, which are both prohibited by the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Law: be&s;ides that they have no Bread; and the People live &s;catter'd upon and down the Country, &s;o that where|ever the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;hould build their Fortre&s;&s;es, they would not be able to Command, within their reach, above Seven or Eight Hou&s;es. Upon which Con&s;iderations they left tho&s;e Pro|vinces in their Ancient Condition, and are &s;atisfi'd only to keep 'em under Subjection for a Nur&s;ery of Slaves; which yeilds 'em every Year no le&s;s then Seven or Eight Thou&s;and. And the &s;ame Rea&s;ons and Ob&s;tacles mo&s;t apparently di&s;courage the <HI>Turks</HI> from Incorporating into the Body of their Empire, tho&s;e Va&s;t Plains of <HI>Tartary</HI> and <HI>Scythia,</HI> and the wide Regions of Mount <HI>Cauca&s;us.</HI> For if the People that inhabit tho&s;e parts, were united into Cities and &s;trong Places, there might be a way found to reduce 'em, and keep 'em in Subjection. But which way is it po&s;&s;ible to &s;ubdue a People that change their Habitations every Month, and all their Life-time wander up and down the Country?</P>

Nor were the&s;e hopes without any Ground, to one that &s;aw no le&s;s then Seven Ve&s;&s;els together at an Anchor in the Road: but I was utterly deceiv'd; for I found nothing at all. The Coa&s;t of <HI>I&s;gaour,</HI> is all cover'd with Wood. Only they have levell'd and lay'd open, about a Hun|derd Paces from the Sea &s;ide, a certain &s;pot of Ground, about Two Hunderd and Fifty Paces long, and Fifty broad; which is the Grand Market of <HI>Mingrelia.</HI> In this there is one Street, containing on both &s;ides of the VVay, about a Hunderd &s;mall Hutts, made up of the Boughs of Trees, fa&s;ten'd one to ano|ther: of which every Merchant takes one. There he lies, and keeps Shop, tho with &s;uch VVares only as he thinks he &s;hall &s;ell in Two or Three Days. But as for tho&s;e which he has bought, and &s;uch for which he does not &s;ee any Probabili|ty of a quick Vent, he keeps 'em in the Ve&s;&s;el, there being no kind of Security a Shoar, There was nothing el&s;e to be had at this Market, nor a Country-Man's Hou&s;e to be heard of in all the parts there about. Thereupon my Guide &s;poke to &s;ome of tho&s;e that came to the Market, to bring us &s;ome <HI>Gom,</HI> which is that &s;ort of Grain, by them made u&s;e of in &s;tead of Bread, &s;ome VVine and other Provi&s;ions; which the Coun|try-Men promis'd to do, but fail'd in their VVords. So that I was &s;urpriz'd, and very much troubl'd to meet with nothing, for our own Provi&s;ions began to grow &s;hort, nor to &s;ee any thing at &s;uch a Market, but a Company of Slaves Chain'd together, and about a Dozen of Tatter'd Fellows, with Bows and Arrows i' their Hands, who it &s;eems were the Officers of the Cu&s;toms, and look'd more ready to Rob, then relieve us. But I was much more &s;urpriz'd and perplex'd, when I heard, that the <HI>Turks,</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Guriel,</HI> were coming into <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> that the People took Arms, and had begun the VVar, Pillaging and Ran&s;acking their Neighbours, and clear|ing
<PB N="109" REF="64">
the Country both of Cattel and Inhabitants. I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s I depended very much upon the <HI>Theatin Mi&s;&s;ionaries</HI> in <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> when I fir&s;t re&s;olv'd to make choice of that way. I was a&s;&s;ur'd they had a Hou&s;e where I might be &s;ecure, and that they could much facilitate my pa&s;&s;age into <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> But their Hou&s;e was Forty Miles from <HI>I&s;agour</HI> by Land, and Fifty Five by Sea. However I &s;ent an Expre&s;s to the Superior of the <HI>Mi&s;&s;ionaries,</HI> with a Letter wherein I gave him an account, That I was come into <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> and that I was going into <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> about bu&s;ine&s;s of great Importance. That I had Let|ters of Recommendation to him from the Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>France,</HI> the Re&s;ident of <HI>Genoa,</HI> the Warden of the <HI>Capuchins</HI> of <HI>Greece,</HI> and the Sollicitor for the <HI>Theatins</HI> at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and there|fore I earne&s;tly de&s;ir'd him to &s;end me &s;ome Per&s;on that might give me nece&s;&s;ary Informations how to proceed in my Voy|age. I would have made my Bargain with the <HI>Expre&s;s</HI> for Ready Money, but he rather cho&s;e to have Cloth. There|upon my Guide agreed with him for two pieces of blew Lin|nen, upon Condition that he return'd in two days and a half. Which two pieces co&s;t Six Shillings at <HI>Caffa.</HI> This done, I return'd to the Ve&s;&s;el, very pen&s;ive, and &s;orely troubl'd to find my &s;elf in a Country where there was no Provi&s;ion to be bought, where Money would not go, nor any Lodging was to be had. And be&s;ides the &s;ight of &s;o many Slaves of all Ages and both Sexes, &s;ome in Chains, &s;ome ty'd two and two, and of the Officers of the Cu&s;tomers that look'd like meer Rob|bers and Ruffians, had fill'd my Head with a Thou&s;and Fears. However I kept a good Heart &s;till, and did my utmo&s;t endea|vour to di&s;&s;ipate tho&s;e Di&s;turbances of my Mind.</P>
<P>All this while I &s;aid nothing to my Comrade or to my Ser|vants, only that I had been promis'd Provi&s;ions; neverthe|le&s;s 'twas but prudence to be as good Husbands as we could of that little we had. Not did the Rumours of the War hin|der the Merchants in our Ve&s;&s;el from going a Shoar; where they took every one a Hutt, and carry'd their Commodities along with 'em.</P>
<P>The 18th at Noon, my Guide came aboard, and brought me an An&s;wer from the Superiour of the <HI>Theatins.</HI> It was very &s;hort: For he only &s;ent me word, That within two or three Days he would come to the Ve&s;&s;el with a Bark, and would &s;erve me to the utmo&s;t of his Power.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="65">
The 19th toward the Evening, a great Number of Country People that had made their e&s;capes, pa&s;s'd by <HI>I&s;gaour,</HI> and gave us a hot <HI>Alarum,</HI> That the <HI>Abca</HI>'s whom the Prince of <HI>Mingrelia</HI> had call'd in to a&s;&s;i&s;t him again&s;t the <HI>Turks,</HI> pillag'd and burnt all before 'em, carrying away the Inhabitants, and driving away the Cattel, where-ever they came. Thereupon the Merchants endeavour'd to carry off what they could in their Long-Boats. But it was late, and the Ve&s;&s;els rid about a Mile from the Shoar; nor could they make above two Re|turns. Thereupon every Captain caus'd two great Guns to be carry'd a&s;hoar, which they planted at the Avenues of the Market, and &s;tood to their Arms all Night. For my own part I cannot expre&s;s the &s;orrow I was in at &s;uch an unfortu|nate and unexpected Accident. I had hardly Con&s;tancy enough to hold out. And that which drove me almo&s;t to de&s;pair was this, That the Captain di&s;cours'd of going to Trade among the <HI>Abca</HI>'s and <HI>Cherks,</HI> and then to return back to <HI>Caffa.</HI> Which was to be three Months at Sea, and not to be laid up till the end of the Year. The Recoyl of my Fortune, which &s;uch a Re&s;olution &s;et before my Eyes, the danger of pe|ri&s;hing at Sea, want of Vittles, the impo&s;&s;ibility to get any; all the&s;e things which I fore&s;aw di&s;tinctly, were not the great|e&s;t Trouble that perplex'd me. My greate&s;t Vexation was to &s;ee my Friends Concerns, which I thought had e&s;cap'd the Dangers of the <HI>Black-Sea</HI> and <HI>Turkey,</HI> expos'd to new Hazards, and my &s;elf likely to undergo the Reproaches and Scorn of People, that would be apt to lay to my Charge unexpected Accidents for Mi&s;carriages, and attribute unfortunate Con|junctures to my Imprudence. To this I may add the Grum|bling and Imprecations of my Servants, that continually rang i' my Ears: Some cur&s;ing De&s;tiny, others the Country, others the People that had adviz'd me to the <HI>Black-Sea.</HI> In a word, I was in &s;uch a profound Agony, as I thought would have ut|terly &s;wallow'd me up. But <HI>GOD</HI> in his Mercy deliver'd me; He &s;trengthen'd me with Courage, and I hearten'd up my People; but their patience was &s;oon tyr'd, ready to break forth every foot with the &s;ame extravagance; for the Hunger which we endur'd heighten'd their Tran&s;ports even to Bruti&s;h Outrage.</P>
<P>The 20th all the People that belong'd to our Ve&s;&s;el, and the re&s;t that lay in the Road, return'd aboard. Chu&s;ing ra|ther to leave their Wooll, their Salt, their Earthen Ware, and &s;uch like Commodities, then to hazard their being tak'n
<PB N="111" REF="65">
by the <HI>Abca</HI>'s, who as they were a&s;&s;ur'd were very near at hand. And indeed their Intelligence was too true. For about Ten a Clock at Night we &s;aw all the Market-place a Fire; and the next Morning &s;uch as ventur'd to &s;ee what was the matter, found nothing but the A&s;hes, and Remainders of the Conflagration.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as our People were all come aboard, I endeavour'd to buy of them Bisket, Rice, Butter, Onions, and dry'd Herbs: but no Body would part with their Goods, fearing le&s;t they &s;hould not return to <HI>Caffa;</HI> till at length by the power of Money I got of &s;everal Merchants Sixty Pounds of Bisket, a few Herbs, Eight Pounds of Butter, and Twelve Pounds of Rice. This was but a &s;mall Stock for &s;ix People. But good Husbandry made it la&s;t longer then I expected. For there was in our Ve&s;&s;el dry'd Fi&s;h in abundance, and we &s;carcely fed upon any thing el&s;e. But I was wonderfully pleas'd when I had prevail'd with my Men to make a Meal without Bread, and lookt upon that Ab&s;tinence of theirs as the Lucky Chance of a Fortunate Day.</P>
<P>The 27th, &s;eeing the Superiour of the <HI>Theatins</HI> did not come, and not knowing what I might hope for from him, I propos'd to my People the Nece&s;&s;ity there was that one of them &s;hould go and find him out; in regard there was none but he that could pre&s;erve us from the Mi&s;eries that threaten'd us, and which came thick upon us every day more then other. But 'twas the want of Vittles and their own de&s;pair that pre|vail'd beyond all my Arguments. So that one among the re&s;t proffer'd me to go &s;eek out the <HI>Theatins.</HI> And it &s;o happen'd that there was a Bark of <HI>Anarguie</HI> that lay by our Ve&s;&s;el. Which <HI>Anarguie</HI> is a Village upon the Sea-Shoar, not above Twenty Miles from <HI>Sippias,</HI> where tho&s;e Fryers have their Re&s;idence. This Bark being come to take in a Lading of Salt, my Servant went aboard, after I had given him four Duckets in Gold, Money, Mercery Ware, and all the Letters I had for the Su|periour of the <HI>Theatins.</HI> Which I did, to the end that the Recommendation of &s;o many Per&s;ons, &s;ome of Quality, the re&s;t his Friends; might ha&s;t'n him to a&s;&s;i&s;t us in our Extremi|ty: be&s;ides that I had written to him my &s;elf at large, de|&s;iring him to aid us if it were in his Power. I wrote to him al&s;o, That the Me&s;&s;enger whom I had &s;ent, had Money, which I de&s;ir'd him to make u&s;e of, for that I begg'd no more of him then his Trouble; for which I &s;hould not al&s;o fall to be farther Grateful.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="66">
The Fourth of <HI>October</HI> in the Morning my Servant return'd, bringing along with him the Superiour of the <HI>Theatins,</HI> who&s;e Name, as I have already &s;aid, was Don <HI>Maria Jo&s;eph Zampi,</HI> of <HI>Mantua:</HI> to whom I pre&s;ently ran and embrac'd him. But ob&s;erve how he acco&s;ted me: <HI>Sir,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>God forgive tho&s;e People that advis'd ye to come this way, the Mi&s;chief they have done ye. You are come into the mo&s;t Wicked and Barbarous Country i' the World; and the be&s;t Cour&s;e you can take is to return back to</HI> Con&s;tantinople <HI>with the fir&s;t Opportunity.</HI> At which words the Joy which I felt for the Arrival of the good Fryer, was &s;oon at an end. However, I carry'd him into my <HI>Cabin,</HI> and there, together with my Comrade, we debated what was be&s;t to be done. We return'd him Thanks in the fir&s;t place for the pains he had taken in coming &s;o far. To which he an&s;wer'd, That he had come according to his promi&s;e, but that the War and the Incur&s;ion of the <HI>Abca</HI>'s, had made the Roads &s;o dangerous, that he dur&s;t not venture him&s;elf. Af|ter that, I told him, That his fir&s;t Complement to me at our fir&s;t Greeting, put me at my Wits end: and therefore I be|&s;ought him to tell me, Whether he were not come to take us along with him, and carry us to his own Re&s;idence? Who an&s;wer'd, That he was come to &s;erve me to the utmo&s;t of his Power, and that he would carry us Home to his own Hou&s;e if we de&s;ir'd: however he would gladly let us know the Na|ture of the Country through which we were to pa&s;s. That it was a Place where there was no Bread to be had; and hard|ly any other Food to be got at that pre&s;ent time: That the Air was very unwhol&s;om, and the People &s;o wicked that it was &s;carce to be imagin'd. I told him, That we had a Letter of Recommendation to the Prince of <HI>Mingrelia.</HI> To which he an&s;wer'd, That this Prince was as great a Cut-throat, and as profe&s;s'd a Robber as any of his Subjects. He told us more|over, That about three Years before, returning from <HI>Italy,</HI> he brought along with him &s;everal Pre&s;ents for the Prince, for the Prince&s;s his Wife, for the Vi&s;ier, and the Principal Lords of the Court, which he di&s;tributed among 'em till he had almo&s;t left him&s;elf nothing; with which the Prince was &s;o far from being &s;atisfi'd, that he &s;ent and took away that little that he had re&s;erv'd; and although he were at that time Phy&s;itian to the Prince and all the Grandees, the <HI>Vi&s;ier</HI> clapt him up &s;oon after in a <HI>Dungeon,</HI> with a Chain about his Neck, and Fetters upon his Feet, to get more Money from him, and that he could not be releas'd out of the Clutches of that Tygre, till
<PB N="113" REF="66">
he had paid him Forty Crowns. Not that I tell ye this, Gen|tlemen, &s;aid he, to &s;end ye back again, but only to inform ye of the danger ye have thrown your &s;elves into, by &s;etting foot in <HI>Mingrelia.</HI> Yet after all this, if you will needs go for|ward, I will do my be&s;t to pre&s;erve your Per&s;ons and your Goods, and to pa&s;s ye &s;ecurely into <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this, I con&s;ider'd what the Father had repre&s;ented to us: and I came to this re&s;ult with my &s;elf, That the Mi&s;|chiefs that threaten'd me in <HI>Mingrelia</HI> were Mi&s;chiefs to come, and which I was in hopes, though I knew not which way, to e&s;cape. Tho&s;e which I endur'd were pre&s;ent, and my Head and my Heart were both full of 'em I repre&s;ented therefore to Father <HI>Zampi,</HI> That whatever Misfortunes &s;hould happen to us in <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> would be le&s;s then tho&s;e would befal us in returning to <HI>Caffa,</HI> which would infallibly be our ruine. I de&s;ir'd him to con&s;ider, that we had neither Provi&s;ion nor Vit|tles, that the Ve&s;&s;el where we were was old, and daily took aboard great Numbers of Slaves of all Ages and Sexes, &s;o that we could hardly &s;tir one by another in the Ship. That a great Number of <HI>Abca</HI>'s and <HI>Mingrelian</HI>'s went and came from Morning till Night, that fill'd it with <HI>Vermin</HI> that would endanger a general Infection, and end in a Pe&s;tilence. That the Ve&s;&s;el would be two Months before &s;he return'd for <HI>Caffa,</HI> at what time the Weather would begin to be un&s;ea&s;onable and tempe&s;tuous; as being that part of the Year when the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI> &s;o dreadful &s;tormy, was mo&s;t furiou&s;ly exa&s;perated by the Violence of continual Tempe&s;ts; &s;o that &s;uppo&s;e they &s;hould get &s;afe to <HI>Caffa,</HI> and thence to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> 'twould be four Months at lea&s;t before they could perform their Voyage, and then we &s;hould be forc'd to begin again, and put to find out a new Project which way to pa&s;s through <HI>Turkey.</HI> Be&s;ides running the Ri&s;co of extravagant Impo&s;itions, or exorbitant Cu&s;toms; and yet after all the&s;e Adventures we &s;hould be &s;till expos'd to ruine, which was the &s;ame thing or wor&s;e then to run the hazard in <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> where the Danger could not be greater, but where the Peril could never la&s;t &s;o long, &s;ince it was but four Days Journey before we &s;hould be in a Country where we &s;hould be &s;ecure.</P>
<P>Father <HI>Zampi</HI> could not gain&s;ay any of my Rea&s;ons: Be|&s;ides that our pa&s;&s;age could not but be advantageous to him|&s;elf in particular, or to his Mi&s;&s;ion. So that he talk'd of no|thing el&s;e but of taking us along with him, and of our leaving
<PB N="114" REF="67">
the Ship for good and all. Now the Bark wherein I had &s;ent my Servant was a long Ve&s;&s;el like a &s;mall Lighter, and was hir'd to go and come with Goods: and into this Ve&s;&s;el it therefore was that we put our Baggage aboard, and about a hunderd Crowns worth of Goods which we bought out of the Ve&s;&s;el. Which Purcha&s;e was made at my Intreaty by Father <HI>Zampy,</HI> becau&s;e he knew what would be&s;t go off in <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> for that Money, as I have &s;aid already, was no otherwi&s;e Current or Valuable there then as it was a &s;ort of Merchandize. Our Baggage being Embark'd before Noon, we &s;et Sail at the &s;ame time. And then it was that I was over-joy'd to find my &s;elf quit of the Ship; for I could not endure the Stench of it. Be&s;ides that the Na&s;tine&s;s and Infamous Behaviour of the Peo|ple aboard made me loath the very &s;ight of 'em. The Ve&s;&s;el was a meer Sink and Dungeon of Slaves, who as &s;oon as Night came, were Chain'd two and two, as well the Boys as the Men. In the Morning they took off their Chains agen, &s;o that I could hardly re&s;t for the ratling of the Irons, and then the very Object it &s;elf griev'd me to the very Heart. Every Morning we were &s;ure to &s;ee a Fire a&s;hoar, which was a &s;ignal that there were people come to &s;ell either Slaves or other Mer|chandize. Upon which they &s;ent away their Long-Boat, in|to which they who had a de&s;ire to come to the Ve&s;&s;el put them&s;elves and their Wares, and being brought aboard, drove the Bargains as they could agree. And indeed the War in <HI>Mingrelia</HI> was very favourable to our Merchants; for the <HI>Abca</HI>'s brought 'em all their Plunder and Booty to &s;ell: Among the re&s;t there came one day to our Ve&s;&s;el an <HI>Abca</HI> of Quality, having a Train of &s;even or eight Men at his Heels, who &s;eem'd to be the arrante&s;t Rakehels in the World. He brought three Slaves, and his Men were loaden with Booty; and among other Things they had got a Frame of an Idol all of Silver; I caus'd 'em to be ask'd, Where the Idol it &s;elf was? To which they an&s;wer'd, That they had left it in the Church, not daring to carry it away, for fear it &s;hould have kill'd 'em.</P>
<P>Our Ve&s;&s;el had Forty Slaves when I left it, which the Tur|ki&s;h and Chri&s;tian Merchants had bought for Arms, Hou&s;hold|&s;tuff, and other Commodities. They gave 'em what they pleas'd them&s;elves, and reck'nd twice as much as the Goods co&s;t 'em. They gave no more then Fifteen Crowns for Men from Twenty Five to Forty Years of Age; and Eight or Ten, for tho&s;e that were older. Hand&s;om Maids from Thirteen to
<PB N="115" REF="67">
Eighteen were &s;old for Twenty Crowns, others for le&s;s. Wo|men for Twelve, and Childern for Three or Four. A <HI>Greek</HI> Merchant that lay in a Cabin next to mine, bought a Woman and a Child at her Brea&s;t. She had incomparable Features in her Face, and a truly Lilly-white Complexion; and indeed I never &s;aw more lovely Nipples, and a rounder Neck, nor a &s;moother Skin; which created at the &s;ame time both Envy and Compa&s;&s;ion. So that I could not chu&s;e but ca&s;t a mournful Look upon her, &s;aying this to my &s;elf, Unfortunate Beauty! neither would I envy or compa&s;&s;ionate thee, were I in ano|ther Condition, and that I did not find my &s;elf ju&s;t upon the Brink of Danger, threaten'd with the greate&s;t Mi&s;eries imagi|nable, if there can be a greater Mi&s;ery then that of Slavery. But that which &s;urpriz'd me was this, That the&s;e mi&s;erable Creatures were no way ca&s;t down, nor did they &s;eem &s;en&s;ible of the mi&s;ery of their Condition. At length when they had bought 'em, their Ma&s;ters took from them the Rags that co|ver'd 'em, clad 'em with Linnen and new Habits, and &s;et 'em to work; the Men and the Boys to moyl in the Ship, and the Women to &s;ow. Nor did they &s;eem to be much di&s;&s;atisfi'd with their Habit, or the Food which was giv'n, only they did not like Working, &s;o that the Cudgel was forc'd to walk now and then to quick'n their Lazine&s;s.</P>
<P>We had a good Wind, and we made u&s;e of Oars as well as Sails in our Bark. And for my own part, all my di&s;cour&s;e was with Father <HI>Zampi,</HI> what cour&s;e I &s;hould take to prevent my falling into the Enemies Hand, and my being plunder'd and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by the <HI>Mingrelians.</HI> Which di&s;cour&s;e at length brought us to talk of tho&s;e Per&s;ons, who&s;e Letters I had &s;ent him. He told me the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador's Letter was a Du|plicate of one which he had &s;ent the la&s;t Year for Atte&s;tations of the Religion of <HI>Colchis:</HI> but when he gave it into my Hands, and that I had read it, I was &s;urpriz'd to find, that having been giv'n me for a Letter of Recommendation, there &s;hould not be the lea&s;t mention of my Name. Which made me afraid le&s;t Father <HI>Zampi</HI> &s;hould think, that the Amba&s;|&s;ador had not that Value and Kindne&s;s for me, which I pre|tended to make him believe. And therefore I thought my &s;elf oblig'd to &s;hew him the Letter which the Amba&s;&s;ador had done me the Honour to write to the Prince of <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> of which this was a Copy.</P>

<P>About Midnight we arriv'd at the Mouth of the River <HI>A&s;tolphus,</HI> call'd by the <HI>Mingrelians, Langur;</HI> and which is one of the bigge&s;t Rivers in <HI>Mingrelia.</HI> There we &s;topp'd and &s;ent to <HI>Anarghie</HI> two of our Seamen, to know what News of the Enemy, and to &s;ee whether the People were not fled, and in what condition they &s;tood. This <HI>Anarghia</HI> is a Village two Miles from the Sea, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable in all <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of a Hunderd Hou&s;es, but &s;o far di&s;tant one from the other, that it is two Miles from the fir&s;t to the la&s;t.</P>

The fifth before day, the two Seamen return'd, and brought us word that the <HI>Abca</HI>'s had made no Inroads within Fifteen Miles of <HI>Anarghia,</HI> but that things were quiet without any Di&s;turbance or Alteration. Thereupon Father <HI>Zampi</HI> de&s;ir'd 'em to Row hard, to the end we might come early to the Vil|lage, and Land our Goods before we &s;hould come to be &s;een by any Per&s;on. All things fell out to our Wi&s;h, and we took a Lodging at a Country-Mans Hou&s;e, which was one of the be&s;t Accommodations in the Town. For we had a great many Che&s;ts, the bigge&s;t of which was full of Books. Thereupon Father <HI>Zampi</HI> advis'd me to open it, and take out the Goods in the &s;ight of the People of the Hou&s;e, to the end they might have no &s;u&s;picion that we carry'd any Trea&s;ure in our Che&s;ts; but might be ready to give it out that we were only Per&s;ons in Holy Orders, for which rea&s;on we loaded our &s;elves with a great Number of Books for our particular u&s;e. I follow'd his Advice, and found it to be very good. For the People of the Hou&s;e were amaz'd to &s;ee nothing in &s;uch a large Che&s;t but only Books; and I am apt to believe they conceited there was nothing el&s;e in all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The ninth a <HI>Lay-Theatin</HI> came to &s;ee us: He was the Phy|&s;itian and Surgeon that &s;erv'd all <HI>Mingrelia.</HI> And the Acce&s;s which his Art had procur'd him to the Prince and all the Gran|dees, had puft him up to that degree of Pride, that he valu'd neither Fathers nor Superiour, and in all his Actions and Di&s;|cour&s;e manife&s;ted a mo&s;t in&s;upportable Superbity. However, I receiv'd and entertain'd him as his Vain-glory &s;eem'd to re|quire. Who thereupon gave me a Thou&s;and A&s;&s;urances of Protection and A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and promis'd to bring us Tidings of the Retreat of the <HI>Abca</HI>'s, &s;o &s;oon as he found his Information to be &s;uch as he could confide in. Nor did he fail in his Un|dertaking; &s;o that he return'd to us the 13th, and brought us the Good News we expected. He told us that he had been with the Prince the Day before, at what time the Intelligence came to him. He recounted al&s;o to us, that the <HI>Abca</HI>'s had carry'd away with 'em Twelve Hunderd Per&s;ons, and a great Number of Cattel, with other Booty; that they had plunder'd the Hou&s;e of a Tenant to the <HI>Theatins,</HI> and taken away three of their Slaves: That the Prince had &s;ent three Gentlemen to the Prince of the <HI>Abca</HI>'s to make his Complaints, and to threaten 'em for their Perfidiou&s;ne&s;s; for that having enterd <HI>Mingre|lia,</HI> under an Engagement and upon Oath to defend it again&s;t the <HI>Turks,</HI> they had made u&s;e of their Forces to Sack and Pillage
<PB N="118" REF="69">
the Country, and was return'd, and had retreated without doing him the lea&s;t Kindne&s;s. And thus after he had given us a full Accompt of the News that was &s;tirring, he told Fa|ther <HI>Zampi</HI> farther, That we might all go together to their Re&s;idence at <HI>Sippias,</HI> and that the Prince and the <HI>Catholicos</HI> had order'd him to a&s;&s;ure me and my Comrade, That we were Welcom, and that he would provide us Men and Hor&s;es to Convoy us into <HI>Georgia.</HI> Upon which we re&s;olv'd to depart the next day.</P>
<P>While we &s;taid at <HI>Anarghia</HI> we &s;uffer'd for no want of any thing; we had Fowl, Wild Pigeons, Porkers, and Goats in abundance. All which my People had in exchange for Lin|nen, Needles, Incen&s;e, Combs and Knives: and they had their Provi&s;ions very Cheap too: Wine was al&s;o very plentiful, for it was then the very time of their Vintage. There was al&s;o at <HI>Anar|ghia</HI> a Lady of Quality, who had made choice of that Place to retire to for &s;ecurity but a little before. She vvas a Widow, and her Husband had been Chief Mini&s;ter or Vizier to the Prince. Father <HI>Zampi</HI> carry'd me to her Hou&s;e, where I pre|&s;ented her vvith &s;ome incon&s;iderable Trifles, and &s;he in Ac|knowledgment of vvhat &s;he had receiv'd, and in hopes of more, &s;ent me every Day a Loaf of half a Pound, vvith &s;ome other of her choice&s;t Viands. One Day &s;he &s;ent me a piece of Wild Boars Fle&s;h, another Day a Ball of Wax, another Day a &s;mall Quantity of Honey, another time a Phea&s;ant, and by the Me&s;|&s;enger &s;till &s;he reque&s;ted &s;ome Trifle or other, as Knives, Sci&s;|&s;ars, Ribband, Paper, or the like, and &s;o &s;he paid her &s;elf double for her Pre&s;ents. One Day &s;he came to give me a Vi|&s;it, and &s;hew'd her &s;elf very Complai&s;ant, and &s;ignifi'd her Fancy for &s;everal other things. But though I did not like this Trade, I kept fair vvith her however, becau&s;e I vvould not vvant Bread, vvhich was not otherwhere to be had.</P>
<P>Father <HI>Zampi</HI> advis'd me to pretend my &s;elf a <HI>Capuchin;</HI> and gave out him&s;elf that I vvas going to the <HI>Capuchins</HI> in <HI>Georgia:</HI> That I had disguis'd my &s;elf becau&s;e I vvould not be known in <HI>Turkey,</HI> and to the end I might travel vvith more freedom. And the better to counterfeit my Di&s;gui&s;e, he per|&s;waded me to go very meanly, and to pretend Poverty upon all Occa&s;ions. And for my own part, I acted my part very vvell, but the ill Management of my Servants prevented my Plot from taking Effect. They brake my Mea&s;ures by the Good Hou&s;e vvhich they kept. For they bought the be&s;t Vittles they could find, let it co&s;t vvhat it vvould. In a
<PB N="119" REF="69">
vvord, they repaid them&s;elves for the &s;carcity vvhich they had endur'd. Which Expences of theirs caus'd People to think I vvas not &s;o poor as I pretended to be.</P>
<P>The 14th, two Hours before Day, vve departed from <HI>Anar|ghia,</HI> and Row'd up the River <HI>A&s;tolphus</HI> two Leagues, after vvhich vve landed our Baggage, and loaded our Goods into &s;ix little Carts: and fill'd two more vvith the Provi&s;ions vvhich Father <HI>Zampi</HI> had bought. The&s;e Eight little Wagons made a great Noi&s;e; for it vvas an unu&s;ual &s;ight in <HI>Mingrelia</HI> to &s;ee &s;o many together. So that in le&s;s then two days the News flew about the Country of the Arrival of certain <HI>Europeans,</HI> vvith Eight Wagons loaden vvith Baggage. Which News vvas &s;pread vvith &s;o many Circum&s;tances, as vvere the occa|&s;ion of &s;everal Misfortunes that befel us, as I &s;hall relate in the pur&s;uit of my Story. Thus vve travell'd four Leagues and a half by Land, and by Sun-&s;et arriv'd at <HI>Sapias.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sapias</HI> is the Name of two little Churches, of vvhich the one is a Pari&s;h-Church of <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> the other belongs to the <HI>Theatins.</HI> It vvas be&s;tow'd upon 'em, together vvith the Church|yard vvherein the two Churches are enclos'd. Which En|clo&s;ure is very large: and vvhere they have al&s;o built &s;everal Apartiments and Lodgings after the Fa&s;hion of the Country: every one of the Fryers having his Apartiment to him&s;elf, according as they are one &s;eparated from another. The le&s;&s;er Lodgings are for their Slaves, and two Families of Country-People vvho are their Tenants.</P>
<P>The <HI>Theatins</HI> came fir&s;t into <HI>Mingrelia</HI> in the Year 1627. vvhere they vvere admitted as Phy&s;itians. The Prince vvho then Raign'd vvas very Potent, and it vvas repre&s;ented to him as a Thing greatly to the Advantage and Benefit of his Coun|try, that Per&s;ons vvho under&s;tood an Art &s;o profitable for the Advantage of his Health, &s;hould be &s;uffer'd to &s;ettle in his Country. Thereupon he made 'em Welcom, gave 'em the Re&s;idence vvhich they enjoy, vvith Lands, and a certain Number of Country-People to Manure the Ground, and fur|ni&s;h their Society vvith Corn and Wine. One and Twenty Years before, the Je&s;uites of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> &s;ent Two of their Fraternity into this Country, but they dy'd there &s;o &s;oon, that the re&s;t vvere afraid to venture any more. The <HI>Theatins</HI> however for &s;ome Years la&s;t pa&s;t, had Hou&s;es in <HI>Tartary, Geor|gia, Circa&s;&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Imiretta.</HI> Which are all for&s;ak'n and de|&s;troy'd, &s;eeing the People no vvay enclin'd to embrace the Roman Religion; and be&s;ides they, were over-imploy'd in their
<PB N="120" REF="70">
Practice of Phy&s;ick. Moreover, they a&s;&s;ur'd me that they had long &s;ince abandon'd <HI>Colchis</HI> likewi&s;e upon the &s;ame Con|&s;iderations; only that they &s;taid there for the Honour of the Roman Church, vvhich glory'd to have her Mi&s;&s;ionaries in all parts of the Earth; but more particularly for the Honour of their own Order, out of vvhich there being no other Mi&s;&s;ion into any part of the World, it vvould turn to their di&s;credit &s;hould they not be able to uphold it.</P>
<P>There were only four <HI>Theatins</HI> at <HI>Sapias</HI> when I arriv'd there, three Prie&s;ts and one Laic. The Prie&s;ts practis'd only Phy&s;ick, the Lay-Brother both Phy&s;ick and Surgery. For he had been up and down in the World, a Chirurgeon by Profe&s;|&s;ion. The <HI>Theatins</HI> affirm, That all the Spiritual Benefit which the Country reaps from their being among 'em, is only Bapti|zing of Infants, there being none which are there Baptiz'd, or but after a very odd Fa&s;hion. Unle&s;s it be in that, they con|fe&s;s, they make no other progre&s;s among the <HI>Mingrelians,</HI> vvho are &s;o far, &s;ay they, from embracing the Roman Ceremonies, that they do not believe the <HI>Europeans</HI> to be Chri&s;tians, be|cau&s;e they do not &s;ee 'em ob&s;erve &s;o many Fa&s;ts, nor with &s;o &s;trict and &s;evere an Ab&s;tinence, be&s;ides that they do not Wor|&s;hip Images. The <HI>Theatin</HI>'s very immediate Slaves, will not Communicate with their Ma&s;ters in their Religious Exerci&s;es; and they have a&s;&s;ur'd me, they could never Educate any one to &s;erve at the Ma&s;s. I have &s;een the&s;e Fryers &s;ometimes Bap|tize Childern; for they Baptize all that they meet with, in Hou&s;es vvhere they have not either been of a long time, or vvhere they do not remember that ever they Admini&s;ter'd that Sacrament before. I have tarry'd &s;everal Days in &s;everal Places of <HI>Mingrelia</HI> with the Superiour of the <HI>Theatins,</HI> and have frequently &s;een his vvay of Baptizing. For vvhen they brought him any one that vvas ill, he call'd for a Ba&s;on of Water, pretending to vva&s;h his Hands, and vvhen he had wa&s;h'd 'em, before he dry'd 'em again, vvith the end of his Finger he touch'd the Forehead of the Child, making the Parents believe, it vvas only to under&s;tand the Di&s;temper.</P>
<P>He Baptiz'd Childern that vvere in Health by flirting a lit|tle Water in their Faces, vvhile he vvas vva&s;hing his Hands, as if he had done it in &s;port. I ask'd him, What it vvas he did? I have Baptiz'd the&s;e Childern, &s;aid he; happy is it for them that vve came into the Hou&s;e. I ask'd him a &s;econd time, What Name he had giv'n 'em? I give 'em no Name, an&s;wer'd he; for oft-times I know not whether I Baptize a
<PB N="121" REF="70">
Male or a Female; there is no Nece&s;&s;ity for the Name, it be|ing &s;ufficient to ca&s;t a drop of Water upon the Infant, and mentally to recite the Form of Bapti&s;m. In a word, the <HI>Theatins</HI> are very mi&s;erable in <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> they pillage 'em, they abu&s;e 'em; nor have they any value or re&s;pect for 'em, unle&s;s it be when any Sickne&s;s or Wound con&s;trains 'em to require their A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>The 18th the Prince&s;s of <HI>Mingrelia</HI> came to vi&s;it the <HI>Thea|tins;</HI> and pre&s;ently the Superiour of the <HI>Theatins</HI> made ha&s;te to attend her. The&s;e Prince&s;&s;es of <HI>Mingrelia</HI> and tho&s;e of the Neighbouring Countries they call <HI>Dedopal&egrave;,</HI> which in the <HI>Geor|gian</HI> Language &s;ignifies Queen. She was a Hor&s;eback, attend|ed by about Eight Women and Ten Men, and &s;ome Lacqueys that ran by her Hor&s;e. But this Train of hers was very ill clad, and very badly mounted. She told the <HI>Prefect</HI> or Superiour, That &s;he under&s;tood that the Provi&s;ion which was u&s;ually &s;ent 'em from <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> was come, and that there were <HI>Euro|peans</HI> in the Hou&s;e, who had brought a long with 'em a con|&s;iderable Quantity of Goods: that &s;he was very glad of it, and de&s;ir'd to &s;ee 'em that &s;he might bid 'em Welcom. Pre|&s;ently I was call'd for to pay my Re&s;pects to her: at what time Father <HI>Zampi</HI> told me that I mu&s;t make her a Pre&s;ent, the way according to the Cu&s;tom of that Country, to ac|knowledge the favourable Vi&s;its of the Prince and Prince&s;s. Upon that I be&s;ought her to tarry till I could bring her one to her Palace; to which &s;he readily con&s;ented. Now &s;he had been told, that I &s;pake <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ian;</HI> upon which &s;he &s;ent for a Slave that under&s;tood <HI>Turki&s;h,</HI> whom &s;he order'd to ask me a Thou&s;and Que&s;tions concerning my Quality, and the de&s;ign of my Travels. I made him an&s;wer, That I was a <HI>Capuchin,</HI> and &s;poke and acted always as a Religious Per|&s;on: but it was plain her Maje&s;ty did not believe me; for all her Di&s;cour&s;e was about Love: and &s;he caus'd the Que&s;tion to be put, Whether I were &s;en&s;ible of that Pa&s;&s;ion, and whe|ther I had ever been in Love? How it could be that a Man could never be in Love, or live without a Woman? And with this Di&s;cour&s;e &s;he went on &s;o plea&s;ingly, that all her Train were &s;trangely delighted to hear her. Though for my part I could have wi&s;h'd the Prince&s;s and her Train farther off from me: For I was afraid &s;he would have caus'd the Hou&s;e to be plunder'd, having three times demanded to &s;ee what I had brought, together with the <HI>Theatins</HI> Provi&s;ion. Which Provi&s;ion is yearly &s;ent 'em from <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> as I have al|ready
<PB N="122" REF="71">
&s;aid, and con&s;i&s;ts of Goods and Commodities of &s;everal &s;orts; of which they are oblig'd to &s;end a good &s;hare to the Prince, the Prince&s;s, to the Vizier, and the Principal Gentle|men of the Country. Father <HI>Zampi</HI> therefore promis'd to bring her the accu&s;tom'd Pre&s;ent the next day, and that I my &s;elf &s;hould bring her one likewi&s;e; and &s;o &s;atisfi'd, God be thanked, &s;he went away.</P>
<P>The 19th in the Morning &s;he &s;ent to invite me to Dinner, whither I went with Father <HI>Zampi</HI> and another <HI>Theatin.</HI> She was then at a Hou&s;e about two Miles from ours. For &s;he did not live with the Prince, who could not endure her, but hated her to death, in regard he had been forc'd to marry her. I found her in a Dre&s;s &s;omewhat richer then the day before; &s;he was likewi&s;e painted; and had us'd all her Skill to &s;et her &s;elf out to the be&s;t Advantage. Her Habit was of Cloth of Gold, the Attire of her Head Gli&s;ter'd with Precious Stones: but for her Vail it was altogether Curious and Gay, and of a particular Fa&s;hion. She &s;ate upon a Carpet, having on each &s;ide Nine or Ten Women that belong'd to her Chamber; for her Maids of Honour were, as they &s;aid, retir'd for &s;afety to a Fortre&s;s by rea&s;on of the Wars. The Hall was full of <HI>Rake|&s;hames</HI> half Naked, which compos'd her Court. Before I was admitted, I was ask'd for the Pre&s;ent I had brought. Which was carry'd by a Lacquey, who gave it to &s;ome of her Ser|vants; con&s;i&s;ting of Pa&s;tes of <HI>Genoa,</HI> Ribbands, Paper, Needles, Twizers, Knives and Sci&s;&s;ars, all Neat and Curious The whole co&s;t about Forty Shillings; but worth above a Five Pounds in <HI>Mingrelia.</HI> The Prince&s;s was extreamly pleas'd; and when &s;he had feen 'em, &s;ent for me into her Pre&s;ence. Where the Slave that &s;pake <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> order'd me to &s;it down upon a Bench that was clo&s;e by. Pre&s;ently the fir&s;t thing &s;he &s;aid to me was, That &s;he would marry me to one of her Friends, and that &s;he would not have me to leave the Country, for that &s;he would give me Hou&s;es, Lands, Slaves and Tenants. After that &s;he fell into the &s;ame Di&s;cour&s;e as the Day before; but it la&s;ted not long, becau&s;e the People gave her Notice that Dinner was ready.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e where &s;he liv'd was in the mid&s;t of five or &s;ix others, every one a hunderd Paces di&s;tant from it, without any Fence either of Hedge or Wall. Before it &s;tood a large <HI>E&s;trade</HI> or A&s;cent of about eighteen Inches high, cover'd with a kind of a <HI>Duomo.</HI> This they &s;pread with Carpets; where al&s;o &s;ate the Prince&s;s, and her Women about four Paces
<PB N="123" REF="71">
from her upon other Carpets: The <HI>Rake&s;hames</HI> that compos'd her Court &s;ate in a Circle upon the Gra&s;s, to the Number of Fifty. As for the <HI>Theatins</HI> and my &s;elf there were two Ben|ches placed near the A&s;cent, the one to &s;it upon, the other to &s;erve us in &s;tead of a Table. So &s;oon as the Prince&s;s was &s;ate down, her Butler &s;pread before her a long painted Linnen Cloth, at the end of which he dre&s;t up his Court-Cupboard, which con&s;i&s;ted of two great Flagons and two &s;mall ones, four Plates and eight Cups, &s;ome bigger &s;ome le&s;&s;er, a Ba&s;on and Eure, and a Skimmer, all of Silver; and at the &s;ame time other Servants &s;et before all tho&s;e that were &s;eated in the &s;ame place, VVooden Planks to &s;erve in &s;tead of Tables; and one al&s;o was plac'd before the VVomen. And thus when every thing was order'd in this manner, they brought into the Mid|dle of the place two Kettles, one very large, carry'd by four Men, which was full of Common <HI>Gom;</HI> and the t'other much le&s;s, which was carry'd by two Men, full of white <HI>Gom.</HI> And I have already ob&s;erv'd, that this <HI>Gom</HI> is a <HI>Pa&s;te</HI> of which the <HI>Mingrelians</HI> make the &s;ame u&s;e in their Dyet, as we do of our Bread. Two other Men brought in upon a kind of <HI>Bier</HI> a whole Porker boyl'd, and four other Men, every one a large Pitcher of Wine. Of all which they cary'd fir&s;t to the Prin|ce&s;s, then to the Women, next to us, and la&s;t of all to the Train. After this they &s;erv'd in to the Prince&s;s a Woodden Platter with Bread and &s;trong Herbs to create an Appetite, to|gether with a large Silver Plate containing two Fowls, the one Boyl'd, the other Roa&s;ted; both ill dre&s;t, and with &s;uch Sawce that my Stomach would not bear. The Prince&s;s &s;ent me a part of her Bread and Herbs, and bid the Me&s;&s;enger tell me withal that I &s;hould &s;tay and Sup with her, and that &s;he would cau&s;e an Ox to be kill'd; but that was only a Com|plement. A &s;hort while after, &s;he &s;ent me two Pieces of her Fowl, and bid the Me&s;&s;enger ask me, Wherefore none of the <HI>European</HI> Workmen, being &s;uch Excellent Gold&s;miths, and Wea|vers both of Silk and Woollen came into <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> but only Monks, of which they had no need, and who&s;e Company they &s;o little de&s;ir'd? Which was a Que&s;tion that did not a little &s;tartle me; for the Prince&s;s &s;pake aloud in <HI>Mingrelian,</HI> and her Slave return'd the Interpretation of his An&s;wer as loud. So that I leave the Reader to judge whether or no the poor <HI>Theatins</HI> were not &s;trangely aba&s;h'd to hear the Prince&s;s pro|pound &s;uch a Que&s;tion. To &s;ay truth, I took the &s;coff to be pretty well aim'd at my &s;elf, and therefore I an&s;wer'd as well
<PB N="124" REF="72">
for my &s;elf as for them, &s;ince &s;he had addre&s;s'd her &s;elf alike to all, That the <HI>European</HI> Arti&s;ts work for Money, and that they had Imployment enough at Home to keep 'em from any thoughts of Gadding abroad, but that they who were in Orders &s;ought only the Glory of God, and the Sal|vation of Souls, and that only tho&s;e two predominant Motives could over-rule the <HI>Europeans</HI> to quit their Country to travel &s;o far.</P>
<P>The Fea&s;t la&s;ted two Hours; and when it was half over, the Prince&s;s &s;ent me a Cup of Wine, and bid the Me&s;&s;enger tell me it was Wine which &s;he pre&s;erv'd for her own Drinking, and the Cup out of which &s;he drank her &s;elf: and this Honour &s;he did me three times. But &s;he wonder'd very much when &s;he &s;aw me mix Water with my Wine, &s;aying withal that &s;he had never &s;een the like done: For &s;he and her Women drank it Neat, and that to a good pitch. When Dinner was ended, &s;he &s;ent to know whether or no I had brought along with me any Spices or Porcelane Di&s;hes; and &s;ix or &s;even of the&s;e Me&s;|&s;ages I had from her all to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, by which I gue&s;t that the beggerly Prince&s;s did not Care&s;s me with &s;o much Ci|vility but only for her own Intere&s;t. But all my An&s;wers were po&s;itive Denials; which put her at length into &s;uch an ill hu|mour, that &s;he told me &s;he would &s;end to &s;earch my Che&s;ts; to which I only reply'd, That &s;he might do it when &s;he pleas'd: which I did, as well fearing le&s;t a refu&s;al and unwillingne&s;s might incen&s;e her Covetous Humour, as to conceal the dread into which her threatning Language had put me. She an|&s;wer'd me, That &s;he had only &s;poke it in Drollery; and I made as if I had really believ'd what &s;he &s;aid: but &s;o &s;oon as we were ri&s;en from the Table, I de&s;ir'd one of the <HI>Theatins</HI> to make ha&s;te home, and give my Comrade Notice of the Prin|ce&s;&s;es words, to the end he might be prepar'd, whatever &s;hould happen. After Dinner &s;he fell again into her Di&s;cour&s;e of Mar|riage, and told me that within a few days &s;he would &s;hew me the Lady &s;he had a mind to be&s;tow upon me. To which I an&s;wer'd as before, That Per&s;ons in Orders were never al|low'd to Marry. And having &s;o &s;aid, &s;he was about to have di&s;mi&s;s'd me. But as ill Luck would have it, as I was making my Obei&s;ance, the Prince&s;s e&s;py'd under my poor and mean Habit, that I wore Linnen much whiter and finer then any was made in <HI>Mingrelia.</HI> Thereupon &s;he came clo&s;e up to me, took me by the Hand, thru&s;t up my Sleeve to my Elbow, and hold|ing me by the Arm, talk'd to one of her Women with a low
<PB N="125" REF="72">
Voice. I was then, I mu&s;t needs confe&s;s, at a cruel Nonplus; for the Ladies Care&s;&s;ing Actions no way pleas'd me; and though &s;he &s;mil'd very plea&s;antly in my Face, yet my Fears were ne'er the le&s;s. And that which troubl'd me mo&s;t was, that I could not under&s;tand what &s;he &s;aid, and yet by her Ge&s;ture I could perceive &s;he &s;poke of me with a more then ordinary Earne&s;tne&s;s and Affection. Nor did I know how to behave my &s;elf before &s;o many People toward a Woman, in whom I con&s;ider'd at the &s;ame time the Quality of a Sove|raign Prince&s;s, and the Impudence of a Curtezan. However, till then I felt no more then only a little Di&s;turbance in my Mind. But that which put me into a very great Con&s;terna|tion was this, that the Prince&s;s, addre&s;&s;ing her &s;elf to Father <HI>Zampi,</HI> gave him this Rebuke: <HI>You have both deceiv'd me,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>but 'tis my Plea&s;ure that you both come hither to me again upon Sunday-Morning, and that the New comer &s;ay Ma&s;s before me.</HI> The Father would have made her an An&s;wer, but the Prince&s;s turning her back, bid us depart.</P>
<P>Upon this I return'd to my Lodging very pen&s;ive and &s;ad: for her Di&s;cour&s;e had fill'd me with a Thou&s;and Fears, appre|hen&s;ive le&s;t her Avarice and &s;ome other Motives might &s;pur her on to do me a Mi&s;chief. And Father <HI>Zampi</HI> admoni&s;h'd me to take it for good warning, and to expect it as a thing that would infallibly happen; which made me re&s;olve to pre|pare for it, in&s;omuch that the Night following we buried all our Goods that were of greate&s;t Value. To which purpo&s;e I caus'd a Pit to be made in the Chamber of the <HI>Theatin</HI> Fryers five Foot deep, where I hid a Che&s;t of Clock-work, and ano|ther of Coral: which were &s;o well cover'd, that there was not the lea&s;t Appearance that the Earth had been &s;tirr'd. Af|terwards I went into the Church with the &s;ame de&s;ign. Where Father <HI>Zampi</HI> advis'd me to open the <HI>Grave</HI> of a <HI>Theatin,</HI> who had been buried &s;ix Years before, and to commit the Care of a little Caskanet to his A&s;hes. But <HI>GOD,</HI> who knew what would &s;oon after happen to that <HI>Grave,</HI> prevented me from following that Advice; &s;o that I rather cho&s;e to dig a Hole in a corner of the Church behind the Door, where I caus'd as deep a Pit to be made as in the Chamber, and there buried a little Box that contained Twelve Thou&s;and Duckets in Gold. Afterwards I hid in the Roof of the Chamber where I lodg'd a Scimiter and a Dagger &s;et with Precious Stones, and &s;ome other Jewels; which Roof was cover'd with Straw. And as for &s;uch other Things as were of great Value, and light, my
<PB N="126" REF="73">
Comrade and I carry'd tho&s;e about us; and as for &s;uch Things as were of le&s;s Worth, we recommended them to the care of the <HI>Theatins.</HI></P>
<P>The 23d I under&s;tood the Kindne&s;s which the Prince&s;s had done me, when &s;he threaten'd to Vi&s;it my Baggage. It was upon a <HI>Sunday,</HI> part of which I had &s;pent in Prayer, and in bewailing my &s;elf, out of a deep &s;en&s;e of the Misfortunes that overwhelm'd me, and the Dangers that environ'd me, not finding any Door open for me to make my e&s;cape. I ex|pected &s;o certainly to be made a Slave, that I dur&s;t not pray to <HI>GOD</HI> for my Liberty. Only I thought it all I could do to beg that I might fall into the Hands of a kind Ma|&s;ter; for that if I might have my choice, I &s;hould ra|ther chu&s;e the Chains of a <HI>Turk</HI> then the Fetters of a <HI>Colchian</HI> Lady.</P>
<P>When we had Din'd, word was brought to the Superiour, That two Gentlemen de&s;ir'd to &s;peak with him at the Door; which two Gentlemen were their Neighbours, both a Hor&s;e|back, in Coats of Mail, and very well arm'd: Nor did the Superiour wonder to &s;ee 'em in that Equipage with &s;uch a Train, in regard it was in time of War. When he came to 'em, the two Gentlemen told the Superiour, That they came to di&s;cour&s;e with him, and the <HI>Europeans</HI> that were newly ar|riv'd. And &s;o &s;aying, they alighted. Thereupon the Supe|riour call'd both me and my Comrade forth, who as readily went to wait upon 'em, never &s;topping to con&s;ider whether they had any ill de&s;ign or no. But they quickly let me under|&s;tand their Errand; for &s;o &s;oon as we acco&s;ted 'em, they caus'd us to be laid hold on by their Followers: and at the &s;ame time they commanded the Superiour and the other <HI>Theatins</HI> who were come to &s;alute 'em, that they &s;hould retire; telling 'em withal, that if they &s;tirr'd, they would cut their Throats. Upon which the Superiour in a Panick fear ran away; but the re&s;t would not for&s;ake us, and the Lay-Brother &s;tood briskly to us. He &s;acrific'd him&s;elf in our behalf; Nor could the Naked Sword which they &s;et to his Throat affright him from our &s;ides. Pre&s;ently our Servants were &s;eiz'd; and one of them who was re&s;olv'd to have made &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance, and to that end drew his Cutlace that hung at his Girdle, was knockt down with a Lance, and then Bound and Ty'd to a Tree.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="73">
Afterwards the&s;e A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inates declar'd they would &s;ee what we had; to whom I an&s;wer'd, That they were our Ma&s;ters, and we only poor <HI>Capuchins,</HI> all who&s;e Riches con&s;i&s;ted in Books, Papers, and &s;uch pitiful Lumber, that they needed not have us'd &s;o much Violence to con&s;train us to &s;hew it. For I had no other Game to play, being &s;eiz'd and bound, and the&s;e Cut-throats become Ma&s;ters both of the Hou&s;e, and all the People that were in it. And indeed through <HI>GOD</HI>'s Mercy it took effect; for immediately they unbound me, and bid me open our Chamber-Door; which was in the fir&s;t Story; and where there was nothing but what we did not much value whether it were &s;een or no. For as I have &s;aid already we carry'd our mo&s;t Co&s;tly Jewels about us; and my Comrade had &s;ow'd his &s;hare in the Collar of a large Furr'd <HI>Ju&s;t-au-Corps</HI> which he wore. And for my own &s;hare I had made 'em up in two little Bundles, and hid 'em in the Che&s;t where my Books were. For I dur&s;t not carry 'em about me for fear of being Murder'd or Robb'd, or &s;old for a Slave. I was there|fore fain to de&s;ire the Lay-Brother and my Comrade to take the Gentlemen a&s;ide, and hold 'em in a Di&s;cour&s;e of Com|po&s;ition, and to offer 'em a little Money, thereby to gain time to take tho&s;e two Co&s;tly Bundles out of my Che&s;t, to the end I might hide 'em the be&s;t I could. Which they did, and I went into the Chamber, and Lockt the Door up|on me. The Souldiers apprehen&s;ive of my De&s;ign, gave the Gentlemen Notice, who pre&s;ently came to the Door, which was &s;trongly Lockt within-&s;ide. At what time my Comrade cry'd out from below, and bid me have a care, for that the Enemy peep'd and watch'd me through the Chinks. Which made me pre&s;ently take away my two little Bundles from the Roof where I had thru&s;t 'em, for fear they had &s;een where I laid 'em, and put 'em in my Pocket: but then perceiving they were about to break open the Door, I flung my &s;elf out at the Window into the Garden, taking &s;uch a Leap, that had not Nece&s;&s;ity con&s;train'd me, I &s;hould not have taken at ano|ther time for never &s;o much: for it had been enough to have broke a Mans Neck; but a Man that is &s;eiz'd with a Panick Dread fears nothing but the Object of his fir&s;t Fears. How|ever, being once down, I ran to the end of the Garden, and threw the two little Bundles among the thicke&s;t of the Bu&s;hes: though the Di&s;traction of my Mind would not &s;uffer me to take a true Notice of the Place where I threw 'em. After this, I return'd to my Chamber, which I found full of Rob|bers,
<PB N="128" REF="74">
&s;ome of whom were abu&s;ing my Comrade, others knock|ing with their Maces upon my Che&s;ts with a de&s;ign to break 'em; but then I took Courage, knowing there was nothing in 'em that was very con&s;iderable, and bid 'em have a care what they did, for that I was the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI>'s Envoy; and that the Prince of <HI>Georgia</HI> would &s;everely cha&s;ti&s;e the Violence they had offer'd me; and &s;o &s;aying I &s;hew'd 'em the King of <HI>Per|&s;ia</HI>'s Pa&s;&s;port, which one of the Gentlemen took and would have torn, &s;aying he fear'd no Body, nor valu'd no Man li|ving upon the Face of the Earth; but the other prevented him, as having a greater Reverence for the Gold Letters and Gilt Seal. After that he bid me open my Che&s;ts, and he would do me no Injury; but if I made any longer delay, he would take my Neck from my Shoulders. To which I was about to have reply'd, in &s;tead of yielding Obedience, which had like to have co&s;t me my Life, for one of the Souldiers had drawn his Sword, and was lifting up his Arm to have &s;plit my Brains. But the Lay-Brother &s;topt his Arm. Upon this I open'd my Che&s;ts; but then, Heav'ns ble&s;s me, what work they made! Whatever they had a mind to, 'twas all free Plunder.</P>
<P>While they were thus bu&s;ie at their Pillage, I was leaning at a Window, and turning my Eyes another way, as unwil|ling to encrea&s;e my Sorrows, I look'd into the Garden, where I perceiv'd two Souldiers among the Bu&s;hes, where I thought I had thrown my little Bundles. Pre&s;ently I ran like mad to the Place, follow'd by a <HI>Theatin</HI> Fryer; but whatever the Matter was, the two Souldiers withdrew when they &s;aw us enter: Neverthele&s;s I was willing to &s;atisfie my &s;elf whether they were there or no, and &s;ought for 'em, but having mi&s;ta|ken the place, through the trouble I was in, I could not then find 'em, &s;o that I thought they had been found and carry'd away. And you may judge by the Value of the&s;e two little Bundles, that amounted to Six Thou&s;and Pounds, what a de&s;perate condition I was in: enough to have broke a Mans Heart: but God &s;u&s;tain'd me through his Mercy, and &s;o &s;up|ported me that I had &s;till a pre&s;ence of mind and thought that &s;eldom fail'd me in extremity. But the loud Cries of my Com|rade and the Lay-Brother, call'd me out of the Garden, into the Chamber: where when I came, I was &s;eiz'd by two Soul|diers, who drew me to a Corner of the Chamber, and took what I had in my Pockets, which was no great Matter. Which done, they took me by the Hands, and wou'd ha'bound
<PB N="129" REF="74">
me. Upon that I made a Noi&s;e, and us'd all the Strength I had, and made &s;igns that they &s;hould carry me to their Ma|&s;ters; and then I told the Chief of the&s;e Cut-throats, that there was no Nece&s;&s;ity to bind or kill me, for that I was rea|dy to &s;uffer whatever they were di&s;pos'd to do to me. Who an&s;wer'd, That they would carry us to the Prince &s;ince we were Amba&s;&s;adors. To which I reply'd, That we were rea|dy to go without binding, and that we hop'd he would do us Ju&s;tice: for that we had Letters for him, for which no doubt but he would have a very great re&s;pect. By this time it grew late, and Night drew on; be&s;ides, it was above fif|teen Miles to the Princes Ca&s;tle: &s;o that they releas'd us, and carry'd no Body along with 'em but only the Servant, who offer'd to make Re&s;i&s;tance at fir&s;t, whom I redeem'd fifteen Days after for Ten Crowns.</P>
<P>When I was rid of the&s;e Freebooters, I went to the Gar|den, for the Fryer that follow'd me before, when I went to look for the two Bundles I had hid in the Bu&s;hes, had been telling the Misfortune which he believ'd had befall'n me, and no Body que&s;tion'd but that the Souldiers had ob&s;erv'd and fol|low'd me, and found the Trea&s;ure I had &s;o endeavour'd to con|ceal. Now I had an <HI>Armenian</HI> Servant at that time, who&s;e Name was <HI>Allaverdy;</HI> (and I therefore name him, becau&s;e &s;everal of my Friends have &s;een him at <HI>Paris</HI> after my return from my fir&s;t Travels, and for that his Fidelity to me at that time was &s;o remarkable that I cannot forbear to mention it.) This poor hone&s;t Man follow'd me into the Garden; but I could not but wonder to &s;ee him throw his Arms about my Neck, with Tears in his Eyes: <HI>Sir,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>we are ruin'd: Fear and our common Misfortune made us forget what we were.</HI> I was a little &s;car'd at fir&s;t, for I took him for &s;ome <HI>Rakehel Mingre|lian</HI> that would have cut my Throat: but knowing him, I was mightily taken with the Mans Affection for me, and bid him forbear weeping. <HI>But, Sir,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>have you lookt well?</HI> I have lookt &s;o well, &s;aid I, that I am too well a&s;&s;ur'd of my ill Luck. However, the Fellow would not be &s;o &s;atisfi'd, but de&s;ir'd me to &s;hew him the place as near as I could gue&s;s, and what cour&s;e I had taken both to hide 'em before, and &s;ince to &s;earch for 'em again. Which I did to &s;atisfie a Ser|vant, who &s;hew'd him&s;elf &s;o much concern'd for me, but for my own part, I lookt upon it to be &s;o much Labour lo&s;t, and therefore never thought it worth my time to help him. More|over, it was by this time almo&s;t Night, and I was &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;s'd
<PB N="130" REF="75">
with Grief, and my Sorrows did &s;o perplex me, that I was not &s;en&s;ible either what I did, whither I went, or what I felt. But I was amaz'd to find the Fellow come and hang about my Neck a &s;econd time, who at the &s;ame time overjoy'd thru&s;t the two little Bundles into my Bo&s;om. Nor is it to be imagin'd what a Change this Comfortable Return of my Ser|vant wrought in my Mind. Though my Con&s;olation did not &s;o much proceed from the Recovery of Six Thou&s;and Pounds, which I thought I had lo&s;t, as to &s;ee the Care that Providence took of me, the Goodne&s;s of GOD, his Pre&s;ence, and his A&s;|&s;i&s;tance. This Con&s;ideration re&s;tor'd me again to my &s;elf in a moment; my pre&s;ent Condition neither troubl'd me, nor did the pro&s;pect of future Mi&s;chief di&s;turb me, but manife&s;tly ac|knowledging that only GOD could have thus pre&s;erv'd me, I conceiv'd &s;uch an A&s;&s;urance of his Pre&s;ervation, that has &s;till &s;upported me in all my Di&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Thus having &s;av'd the two High-Priz'd Packets, I made lit|tle accompt of what they might have taken out of my Che&s;ts; &s;o that returning to my Chamber, I gave an accompt of my good &s;ucce&s;s to my Comrade, whom I found re&s;toring to order the confu&s;ion which tho&s;e Robbers had made; by which it ap|pear'd that they had carry'd away only &s;ome few Cloaths, &s;ome Arms, Copper Ve&s;&s;els, and other Trifles. There we agreed together, not to let any Body know that we had found the two little Bundles, to the end they might think we had nothing more of Value to lo&s;e. Which prov'd to be very good Coun&s;el. For the <HI>Theatin</HI>'s Servants, thought we had been utterly Rob'd. Tho thanks be to God, the whole that we lo&s;t did not amount to above One Hunderd Pound.</P>
<P>The 24th in the Morning the Superiour of the <HI>Theatins,</HI> and the Lay Brother, carry'd me to the <HI>Catholicos,</HI> and the Prince to demand Ju&s;tice, and would have had me carry'd to each a Pre&s;ent. I alleadg'd in vain, that it would look &s;trange|ly for us to complain of being Robb'd and Plunderd of all, and yet to bring Pre&s;ents. But Cu&s;tom prevail'd, and I pre|&s;ented to the <HI>Catholicos,</HI> a Knife, Spoon and Fork of Silver in one Ca&s;e, with a Hat which he had &s;ent to reque&s;t of me. Which done, I &s;hew'd him the Pa&s;s and Command of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> King, as al&s;o to the Prince: but I did not deliver to the Prince the Letter from the French Amba&s;&s;ador, in regard the <HI>Theatins</HI> did not think it proper. But neither the one nor the other gave me any &s;atisfaction. The Prince told me, that in time of War (as now it happen'd to be) he was not Ma&s;ter of the No|bility.
<PB N="131" REF="75">
That at another time he would have done me Ju&s;tice &s;peedily, and to the full: However he would endeavour the Re&s;titution of what had been taken from me. The <HI>Catholicos</HI> told me the &s;ame Story, and in &s;tead of a&s;&s;i&s;ting me, began to preach me a Lecture of Con&s;olation. However, they made choice of two Gentlemen to go in their Names and demand what had been tak'n from us.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Thing that I got by this Days Work, was the Di&s;covery which I made, that the <HI>Dadian</HI> or Prince had a &s;hare in the foregoing Days Robbery, and that he had a third part of the Goods for him&s;elf. Which Di&s;co|very &s;erv'd to make me under&s;tand the Nature of the Country where I was, and that the Dangers were the more inevitable that threaten'd us. After our departure, the two Gentlemen appointed to &s;erve us, went along with us, and lay at our Hou&s;e, where it was nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;ent 'em with &s;omething at their Arrival. And they for their parts made a great &s;hew as if they had rid about all the next Day, and the Day fol|lowing to &s;erve us; but all their Riding produc'd nothing: for the 26th in the Evening they return'd to tell us they could do us no good; nor could they look any farther, for that the <HI>Turks</HI> were enter'd <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> burnt and &s;ackt all before, and therefore they were oblig'd to return &s;peedily to their Ma|&s;ters.</P>
<P>I was &s;o accu&s;tom'd to &s;uffer, that the&s;e &s;ame dreadful Ty|dings hardly mov'd me. But the <HI>Theatins</HI> were at their Wits end; fore&s;eeing that this Incur&s;ion of the <HI>Turks</HI> would utter|ly ruine 'em: therefore both they and we prepar'd for flight. At the &s;ame In&s;tant we heard two great Guns go off, which was a Signal from the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Rucks</HI> of the Enemies ap|proach. Upon which Signal all the People betake them&s;elves to flight, carrying away with 'em into the Woods and Strong-Places whatever they are able.</P>
<P>The 27th by break of Day we began our Flight with the re&s;t: but I re&s;olv'd not to meddle with any thing that I had bury'd, or that I had hid in the Roof of the Hou&s;e, which I held to be more &s;ecure then if I &s;hould carry 'em along with me. The <HI>Theatins</HI> had only one Wagon drawn by two <HI>Oxen,</HI> and two Hor&s;es to carry the whole Baggage belonging to the Hou&s;e and two Childern: and as for the Hor&s;es, the Lay-Brother rode upon one, and my Comrade on the other; who was then &s;ick, which very much retarded our Journey. Two <HI>Theatin</HI> Fryers and my &s;elf follow'd the Wagon afoot; and
<PB N="132" REF="76">
the Slaves and the re&s;t of the Servants belonging to the Hou&s;e follow'd us. So that there remain'd but one Fryer to look after it, and a Thou&s;and Things more which we could not carry away, for want of Conveniency. I my &s;elf left all my Books, my Papers, and Mathematical In&s;truments behind me, believing that neither the <HI>Turks</HI> nor <HI>Mingrelians</HI> would trouble them&s;elves with 'em. The Father, who &s;taid behind, fled into the Woods in the Day-time, when he heard any Rumour of the Enemies coming, and return'd to the Hou&s;e at Night. Now I have already ob&s;erv'd, that the Wars of the <HI>Mingrelians</HI> and their Neighbours &s;eldom la&s;t long, being no more then Inroads for Spoil and Plunder, the heat of which being over, the Enemy retreats back again: and therefore the Inhabitants always leave one or two Per&s;ons in their Hou&s;es, to prevent the Neighbours from pillaging the Corn, Wine, and other Provi&s;ions which they cannot carry away. Which Per&s;ons are &s;ometimes &s;urpriz'd by the Enemy, but very rare|ly; for that they are always upon the Watch; and for that the Woods are &s;o near and &s;o thick, that they can ea&s;ily run for't, and hide them&s;elves when any danger appears.</P>
<P>'Twas one of the mo&s;t lamentable Things in the World to behold the&s;e poor People in their flight: Women lugging their Children and their Bundles: Men &s;tooping under the Burden of their Baggage: Here one driving his Cattel; ano|ther halling a Cart after him full of Hou&s;hold&s;tuff. The High|ways were &s;trew'd with People quite weary'd off their Legs, and &s;o faint, that they were ready to die. Of Aged and De|crepit People and Children not able to go, a great Number were to be &s;een crying out, and making lamentable Moans for A&s;&s;i&s;tance. It was &s;uch a &s;pectacle of Lamentation, Mi|&s;ery and De&s;olation, that would have melted the Hearts of any but of tho&s;e Barbarians. Yet I mu&s;t confe&s;s I was not much concern'd at it, not out of hard-heartedne&s;s, but becau&s;e my Compa&s;&s;ion was all &s;pent, my own Mi&s;eries had &s;o drain'd me, that I had none left for any Body el&s;e. Now the Place whither we made our Retreat was a Fortre&s;s in the Woods, like tho&s;e which I have already de&s;crib'd; of which the Lord was call'd <HI>Sabatar</HI> a <HI>Georgian,</HI> who turn'd Mahumetan, and afterwards became a Chri&s;tian. He was al&s;o lookt upon to be le&s;s a Thief and le&s;s a Ra&s;cal then the re&s;t: and we ar|riv'd at this Fortre&s;s after a tedious Journey of five I eagues in deep Mud and Dirt, out of which I could not think the Cart could ever have been drawn; which was the rea&s;on we
<PB N="133" REF="76">
were forc'd to load and unload twenty times by the way: nor would it be any News to tell ye, That I was twice very near being pillag'd and lo&s;ing my Life; in regard I ran that hazard every Day. When we came to the Fortre&s;s, he that own'd it let us in, and receiv'd us kindly enough. For the <HI>Theatins</HI> had told him, That I was a Per&s;on that never receiv'd a Cour|te&s;ie but I made a return for it. He lodg'd us in the place where the Oven &s;tood, in a little &s;curvy Hutt, where we were no more &s;helter'd from the Weather then tho&s;e that lay i' the open Air; for it rain'd in on every &s;ide. However, it was a great Favour that we had it, and were not crowded as were an infinite Number of poor Wretches one upon another. For the Fortre&s;s was full of People when we arriv'd: there being in it no le&s;s then Eight Hundred Per&s;ons, Women and Children for the mo&s;t part.</P>
<P>But here, before I continue the farther Recital of my Mi&s;|fortunes, give me leave to &s;ay &s;omething of the Occa&s;ion of this Incur&s;ion of the <HI>Turks,</HI> and what I have learnt concerning the late <HI>Mingrelian</HI> Wars, and of the People of <HI>Imiretta</HI> and <HI>Gu|riel,</HI> in which their Formidable Neighbours the <HI>Turk</HI> and <HI>Per|&s;ian</HI> were engag'd. Therein you will find &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages per|haps not unworthy the Remembrance of Hi&s;tory; and cer|tainly 'tis a thing equally to be ob&s;erv'd and wonder'd at, That &s;uch &s;mall and incon&s;iderable Kingdoms &s;hould continu|ally produce &s;uch Tragick Revolutions. Nor &s;hall I be accus'd to have injur'd the People of the&s;e Countries, while I tell ye how wicked they are, when you have read this part of my Story; &s;ince the bare Relation which I &s;hall make in repre|pre&s;enting 'em &s;uch, will ju&s;tifie me perhaps in the Judgment of my Readers.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t Famous Prince that ever <HI>Mingrelia</HI> had, &s;ince it revolted from the King of <HI>Imiretta,</HI> was <HI>Levan Dadian,</HI> Un|cle to him that Reigns at this pre&s;ent. He was Valiant, Gene|rous, a Per&s;on of great Wit, indifferently ju&s;t and more happy in his Undertakings. He made War upon his Neighbours and vanqui&s;h'd 'em all: and no que&s;tion but he would have made an excellent Prince, had he been born in a better Country. But the Cu&s;tom in his Country of Marrying &s;everal Wives, and tho&s;e near Relations, was that which tran&s;ported him to &s;uch Exce&s;&s;es as render'd him unworthy of all <HI>Encomiums.</HI></P>
<P>He remain'd an Orphan almo&s;t as &s;oon as he had out-liv'd his Infant Years: at what time his Father dying, left him to the Tuition of his Brother, who was Uncle by the Fathers &s;ide
<PB N="134" REF="77">
to the Young Pupil, and call'd by the Name of <HI>George;</HI> the Soveraign Prince of <HI>Libardian,</HI> a Country that extends it &s;elf a great way into Mount <HI>Cauca&s;us.</HI> This <HI>George</HI> faithfully di&s;|charg'd his Tru&s;t in the Tuition of his Nephew. He bred him well, and prudently Govern'd <HI>Mingrelia</HI> during his Mino|rity.</P>
<P><HI>Levan</HI> being Twenty Four Years of Age, E&s;pous'd the Daughter of the Prince of the <HI>Abca</HI>'s, by whom he had two Sons; &s;he being a Lovely Prince&s;s, and a Woman of a great Wit. 'Tis true, &s;he was tax'd of being none of the mo&s;t Faithful Wives, which perhaps might be in revenge of the Foul-play which her Husband openly play'd her every Day. Now among the re&s;t of the Women with whom he fell in Love, one was the VVife of <HI>George</HI> his Uncle, who had been his Tutor, and to whom he had been &s;o highly oblig'd. This Lady went by the Name of <HI>Darejan,</HI> of a Con&s;iderable Fa|mily, which was call'd <HI>Chilak&egrave;.</HI> And as &s;he was extreamly beautiful, but wicked and ambitious beyond Imagination, &s;he was not only content to violate her Conjugal Fidelity, and for two Years together to live in an Ince&s;tuous League with the Prince her Nephew, but over-per&s;waded him at the end of that &s;ea&s;on to take her away by Force, repudiate his own VVife, and Marry her. <HI>Levan</HI> was over-rul'd by her: He took the Adultere&s;s by Force from her Husbands Hou&s;e; He Marry'd her, and eight days after &s;ent home his fir&s;t Wife ig|nominiou&s;ly, without any Train, back to her Father, King of the <HI>Abca</HI>'s, after he had caus'd her No&s;e, her Ears and her Hands to be cut off. And the pretence which he took to ex|cu&s;e &s;o horrid a piece of Cruelty was, That &s;he had committed Adultery with the <HI>Vizier,</HI> who&s;e Name was <HI>Papona.</HI> And the better to make People believe the truth of it, he caus'd this <HI>Vizier</HI> to be &s;topp'd into the Mouth of a <HI>Cannon</HI> at the &s;ame time that he maim'd his own VVife. However, all Men agreed, that there was nothing of Incontinence that had been committed between her and the <HI>Vizier;</HI> only that he &s;acrific'd his VVife and his <HI>Prime Mini&s;ter</HI> to the Hatred and Jealou&s;ie of the <HI>Chilakite.</HI></P>
<P>The Love of this wicked VVoman caus'd him to Sacrifice the&s;e Important Victims: but her Ambition forc'd him to offer up two more pretious Oblations. For <HI>Levan</HI> him&s;elf poy&s;on'd his two Sons which he had had by the <HI>Prince&s;s</HI> his VVife. The <HI>Chilakite</HI> per&s;wading him to this incredible Inhumanity, to
<PB N="135" REF="77">
the end the Children which &s;he &s;hould have by him might Reign more &s;ecurely.</P>
<P>Prince <HI>George</HI> had a great kindne&s;s for his Wife, as much an Adultere&s;s, and as wicked as &s;he was. So that her being tak'n from him by force threw him into a mo&s;t furious de&s;pair. He perform'd the Ceremony of Mourning for her Forty Days, according to the Cu&s;tom of the Country, as if &s;he had been Dead; after which he betook him&s;elf to Arms, and fell into the Territories of the Prince his Nephew. But <HI>Levan</HI> was Va|liant, and had good Souldiers about him, &s;o that <HI>George</HI> was con&s;train'd to retire into his Mountains, where he died &s;oon after for Grief and Vexation.</P>
<P>The Prince of the <HI>Abca</HI>'s al&s;o went about to revenge the Affront and Injury done him, in the Per&s;on of the Prince&s;s his Daughter, but with as ill &s;ucce&s;s. He rais'd Forces, began a War again&s;t the Prince of <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> and tho the con&s;equen|ces of the War did not at all fall out to his Advantage, yet would he never make Peace or Truce with him, nor would he put an end to the War, till he under&s;tood the Death of his Barbarous Son-in-Law.</P>
<P>There was al&s;o a Third Enemy, more formidable but as un|&s;ucce&s;sful that would not &s;uffer <HI>Levan</HI> to be at re&s;t. This was his own Brother call'd <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> who engag'd him&s;elf &s;o far in the ju&s;t Re&s;entments of his Uncle <HI>George</HI> and the Prince of the <HI>Abca</HI>'s, that he re&s;olv'd to revenge their Quarrel, by cau&s;ing the Criminal to be Murder'd. To that purpo&s;e he corrupted one of his Guards an <HI>Abca</HI> by Birth to A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him; the Prince's Cup-Bearer being al&s;o Privy to the Con&s;piracy. The Plot was &s;o lay'd that <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> &s;hould go and Dine at the Palace: that the <HI>Abca</HI> Guard &s;hould &s;tand behind him with a Lance in his Hand, and that when the Prince lifted to his Mouth one of tho&s;e great Beakers of Wine which the <HI>Mingrelians</HI> Drink at the end of the Meal, the Cup-Bearer &s;hould make a &s;ign to the <HI>Abca,</HI> who was then to &s;trike him through the Body with his Lance. This Plot was within a little of being put in Exe|cution, but fail'd when the &s;troak was ready to have been gi|ven, Divine Ju&s;tice re&s;olving that <HI>Levan</HI>'s Crimes &s;hould be his own Murderers and Executioners, which &s;par'd him a long time before they accompli&s;h'd it. For the Prince perceiv'd the &s;ign which the Cup-Bearer gave the Guard, and as it were in|&s;pir'd, threw him&s;elf down from the place where he &s;tood, &s;o that the Lance never touch'd him at all. However the <HI>Abca</HI> e&s;cap'd, but the Cup-Bearer was &s;eiz'd, put to the Rack, and
<PB N="136" REF="78">
di&s;member'd after he had confe&s;s'd what he knew of the Plot. Prince <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> had his Eyes pull'd out, and dy'd &s;oon after, lea|ving a Son, who is now Prince of <HI>Mingrelia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Levan</HI> had by his Ince&s;tuous Conjunction two Sons, and one Daughter, who &s;uffer'd every one for the Iniquity of their Father, being all Three Paralytick. No means were un&s;ought for their Cure, but all in vain: their Di&s;temper Non-plu&s;s'd all the Phy&s;itians in the Country, the <HI>Theatins</HI> and an Emi|nent <HI>Greek</HI> Phy&s;itian who was &s;ent for from <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> The Younge&s;t Son and the Daughter dy'd by that time they arriv'd at the Age of Twenty Years or there-about: but <HI>Alex|ander</HI> the Elde&s;t Son liv'd longer, was Marry'd and had a Child; his Wife being the Daughter of the Prince of <HI>Guriel.</HI> Which one Son he had a Year after he was Marry'd, and then dy'd, while his Father was yet living.</P>
<P><HI>Levan</HI> dy'd in the Year 1657. after who&s;e Death the <HI>Shi|lakite</HI> was in &s;uch high Credit, as to &s;et up in his place a Son, which &s;he had by her fir&s;t Husband, but which mo&s;t People were a&s;&s;ur'd was begot by <HI>Levan.</HI> But this Young Prince who&s;e Name was <HI>Vomeki,</HI> did not Reign long. For the Vice-Roy of that part of <HI>Georgia</HI> which is under the Dominion of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> di&s;poil'd him of his Principality, and reinve&s;ted in it <HI>Levan</HI>'s Lawful Heir, after he had invaded <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> and the Territories of <HI>Imiretta.</HI> Which Inva&s;ion being an Acci|dent that happens to be genuinely appo&s;ite to this Recital, I &s;hall only give a &s;hort accompt of the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Deceas'd King of <HI>Imiretta,</HI> who was call'd <HI>Alexander,</HI> and who dy'd in the Year 1658. had Two Wives, the Fir&s;t was the Daughter of the Prince of <HI>Guriel</HI> call'd <HI>Tamar,</HI> whom he divorc'd for her Adulteries, after he had had a Son and a Daughter by her. The Son, who was call'd <HI>Bacrat Mirza</HI> Reigns at this pre&s;ent King of <HI>Imiretta.</HI> The Daughter is Prince&s;s of <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> the &s;ame that I have giv'n ye &s;uch an accompt of, that would have both Robb'd and Marry'd me to her Friend. The Second Wife which <HI>Alexander</HI> Marry'd was call'd <HI>Darejan,</HI> a Young Prince&s;s and Daughter of the Great and Famous <HI>Taymur Razkan,</HI> la&s;t Soveraign King of <HI>Georgia.</HI> He had no Children by her, and left her a Widow after he had been Marry'd to her four Years. They talk Wonders of her Beauty and her alluring Graces. So &s;oon as his Son-in-Law <HI>Bacrat</HI> came to the Throne, &s;he wou'd have had him to Mar|ry her. <HI>Bacrat</HI> was not then above Fifteen Years of Age; &s;o
<PB N="137" REF="78">
that the Charms of her Beauty could not make tho&s;e deep Impre&s;&s;ions upon his Heart, as being &s;o young that the Evil Cu&s;toms of his Country had not yet corrupted him. VVhich was the Rea&s;on that he abhorr'd the Propo&s;al, and return'd di&s;dainful An&s;wers to her Court&s;hip. <HI>Darejan</HI> therefore find|ing &s;he could not &s;upport her &s;elf upon the Throne, imme|diately advanc'd to his Bed a young Per&s;on of Twelve Years of Age, her Kin&s;woman, call'd <HI>Si&s;tan Darejan,</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Daitona,</HI> the Brother of <HI>Taymur Razkan,</HI> whom <HI>Bacrat</HI> Marry'd at Fifteen Years of Age, as has been already &s;aid. So that <HI>Darejan</HI> a&s;&s;ur'd her &s;elf of the Soveraign Power, and of keeping the King and Queen continually under her Guardian|&s;hip. But <HI>Bacrat,</HI> as young as he was, perceiv'd his Mother-in-Laws De&s;ign, and one Day gave her apparent Te&s;timonies of his Di&s;gu&s;t. Upon which <HI>Darejan,</HI> to &s;atisfie <HI>Bacrat,</HI> a&s;|&s;ur'd him that &s;he would forbear to take any Authority upon her. Who being a good-natur'd well-meaning Prince, ea&s;ily believ'd <HI>Darejan,</HI> and re&s;tor'd her to his former Confidence, not dreaming of the Trea&s;on that &s;he was meditating again&s;t him. To that purpo&s;e &s;he feign'd her &s;elf &s;ick, and &s;ent for the King to come to her; who went accordingly with a great deal of Frankne&s;s and VVillingne&s;s; at what time certain People that &s;he had po&s;ted in her Chamber, &s;eiz'd and bound him. Pre&s;ently &s;he order'd him to be conveigh'd to the For|tre&s;s of <HI>Cotatis,</HI> the Principal City of the Country, the Gover|nour of which place was her own Creature. Soon after &s;he came thither her &s;elf; &s;ent for all the Grandees whom &s;he had gain'd to her Party, and of whom &s;he was a&s;&s;ur'd, and with them con&s;ulted for five Days together what to do with the King. Some advis'd her to put him to Death; others to pull out his Eyes: which latter advice &s;he follow'd, and &s;o the Prince was depriv'd of his &s;ight. VVhich happen'd Eight Months after the Marriage of that poor Prince, which they &s;aid moreover he had not fully then con&s;ummated.</P>
<P>Among the re&s;t of the Lords that were of <HI>Darejan</HI>'s Party, there was one with whom &s;he was pa&s;&s;ionately in love, who&s;e Name was <HI>Vactangle:</HI> Him &s;he Marry'd, and caus'd him to be Crown'd King in the Fortre&s;s. Which highly incens'd the re&s;t of the Lords, who thought them&s;elves all affronted by his Advancement. Thereupon they fell oft from &s;iding with <HI>Darejan,</HI> joyn'd them&s;elves with the contrary Party, took Arms, and call'd to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance the Princes of <HI>Guriel</HI> and <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> offering the Kingdom to which of the two &s;hould
<PB N="138" REF="79">
fir&s;t come to their Aid. <HI>Vomeki Dadian</HI> was the fir&s;t that ap|pear'd in the Field with all the Forces of his Country; and &s;oon reduc'd under his Subjection all that part which held for <HI>Darejan,</HI> except the Fort of <HI>Cotatis.</HI> However, he laid Siege to that al&s;o, but for want of Artillery, he could do little good again&s;t the Be&s;ieged, only that he kept 'em from &s;tirring forth out of their Walls; and it would have co&s;t him a long time before he could have brought 'em to a &s;urrender, had it not been for the Politick Contrivance of a Lord of the Country, who&s;e Name was <HI>Ottia Chekaiz&egrave;,</HI> who brought that to pa&s;s by his Wit, which they could not do with all their Force. He went to the Fortre&s;s full of a feign'd De&s;pair, occa&s;ion'd by the Prince of <HI>Mingrelia;</HI> he made <HI>Darejan</HI> believe that he was reduc'd to that extremity, that he knew not where to find a more &s;ecure Sanctuary: that he came to throw him&s;elf at her Feet, to beg her Pardon, and de&s;ire her Protection again&s;t that Prince. <HI>Darejan</HI> fell into the Snare. She believ'd what|ever <HI>Ottia</HI> &s;aid, and that his extraordinary Zeal for her In|tere&s;ts was true. She admitted him into her Council, &s;oon after encreas'd by the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Tifflis</HI> and the <HI>Catholicos</HI> of <HI>Georgia,</HI> whom the Viceroy of that Country had &s;ent her, fearing le&s;t they in whom &s;he mo&s;t confided &s;hould betray her. But this &s;ame Runagate deceiv'd 'em both, as quick-&s;ighted as they were. He told <HI>Darejan</HI> in their hearing, That con&s;i|dering the Condition of her Affairs, there was no other way to expel the Prince of <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> to regain what he had won, and to Reign &s;ecurely, but to have recour&s;e to the <HI>Turk.</HI> That her be&s;t way was to &s;end her Husband to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> for A&s;|&s;i&s;tance, and the Confirmation of his Coronation: That the Kingdom of <HI>Imiretta</HI> was Tributary to the Port, and that the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> had both Right and Power &s;ufficient to re&s;tore the Country to Peace, and fix him in the Throne. <HI>Darejan</HI> was Charm'd by this Advice, and while he that gave it, offer'd to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the Management of it, and to Conduct <HI>Vactangle</HI> to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> &s;he threw her &s;elf at his Feet, not having Words enough to expre&s;s that Acknowledgment which &s;he had in her Heart. <HI>Vactangle</HI> took only two Men along with him, to the end he might Travel with the more Security and Privacy. Thus being &s;oon ready, the cunning <HI>Ottia Chikaiz&egrave;</HI> his Guide, caus'd him to &s;et forth out of the Fortre&s;s about Twilight, and carrying him through By-ways to bring him the more in&s;en|&s;ibly to the Be&s;iegers, brought him in le&s;s then an Hour into their Camp. The Prince of <HI>Mingrelia</HI> caus'd his Eyes forth|with
<PB N="139" REF="79">
to be pull'd out, and &s;ent that Night to <HI>Darejan</HI> to let her know that he had her Husband Pris'ner, and that he had put out his Eyes. This News &s;urpriz'd her &s;o, that her Cou|rage and Re&s;olution quite fail'd her, and in a &s;hort time after &s;he &s;urrender'd the Fortre&s;s, which was plunder'd from Top to Bottom. In&s;omuch that it was certainly reported that the Prince of <HI>Mingrelia</HI> carry'd thence a very rich Booty, and among the re&s;t Twelve Wagons of Silver, Plate and Move|ables. For, as it was &s;aid, the Kings of <HI>Imiretta</HI> had heap'd together &s;uch a va&s;t Quantity of Plate, that every thing with|in the Palace was of Ma&s;&s;ie Silver, even to the Steps and Foot|&s;tools. Which is no difficult thing to believe in a plentiful Country, and where there is a good Trade, and adjoyning to Countries which were formerly very Wealthy, and where it appears that Money was not then in u&s;e, there being very little that is &s;tirring at pre&s;ent. The Prince of <HI>Mingrelia</HI> al&s;o carry'd away along with him the King and Queen of <HI>Imiretta,</HI> the wicked <HI>Darejan,</HI> and the unfortunate <HI>Vactangle</HI> her Hus|band; but to the Viceroy of <HI>Georgia</HI> he generou&s;ly return'd the two Prelates which he had &s;ent to the Prince&s;s to be her Privy Coun&s;ellors.</P>
<P>The Viceroy of <HI>Georgia</HI> is call'd <HI>Shanavas Can;</HI> being de&s;|cended al&s;o from the la&s;t Soveraign Prince&s;s of that Country: but he turn'd <HI>Mahumetan</HI> to make him&s;elf capable of enjoying the Viceroy&s;hip under the <HI>Per&s;ian.</HI> He has only two Lawful Wives, who are both Chri&s;tians, of which the one is call'd <HI>Mary</HI> the Si&s;ter of <HI>Levan</HI> Prince of <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> who gave the fir&s;t occa&s;ion to this Relation: This Lady when &s;he under&s;tood how the dete&s;table <HI>Shilakite</HI> had excluded the lawful Heir in favour of a Son which &s;he had before &s;he was Marry'd to <HI>Levan,</HI> daily importun'd the Prince her Husband to undertake her Ne|phews Cau&s;e, and to &s;ettle him in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Principa|lity, to which he was the true and lawful Heir. But the Viceroy would not act Hand over Head by force in this Affair. For <HI>Min|grelia</HI> being Tributary to the <HI>Turk,</HI> he dur&s;t not declare open Ho&s;tility again&s;t that Country, without the knowledge and con|&s;ent of the King of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> But at length a favourable opportunity offer'd it &s;elf. For &s;o &s;oon as the Prince of <HI>Mingrelia</HI> was en|ter'd into the Kingdom of <HI>Imiretta,</HI> as has been already &s;aid, <HI>Darejan</HI> who was near Kin&s;-woman to the <HI>Georgian Viceroy,</HI> and had been bred up in his Hou&s;e, and <HI>Vactangle</HI> her Husband, &s;ent and offer'd the Kingdom to <HI>Archylas</HI> his Elde&s;t Son, if he would come and drive out the <HI>Mingrelian.</HI> The <HI>Viceroy</HI> made
<PB N="140" REF="80">
this offer known to the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and a&s;&s;ur'd him withal that he would add that Kingdom and <HI>Mingrelia</HI> to his Empire, if he would but give him leave to Conquer 'em. To which when his Maje&s;ty had &s;ent him his con&s;ent, he mu&s;ter'd all his Forces and march'd toward <HI>Imiretta.</HI> But he was no &s;ooner enter'd the Kingdom, when news was brought him that a great <HI>Georgian</HI> Lord, taking the advantage of his ab&s;ence, was up in Arms, and preparing to ran&s;ack all the Country. Upon which he march'd back again with all his Forces again&s;t the Rebel, defeated and put him to Death, and then return'd to|ward <HI>Imiretta.</HI></P>
<P>The Grandees of the Kingdom that invited him in, had rais'd Four Thou&s;and Men, which was a great Army for a Country &s;o bounded as that, and this number too Augmented every Day, &s;ome flocking out of fear of His Power, others allur'd by the charming Fame of his Valour. So that he found little or no Re&s;i&s;tance either in <HI>Imiretta</HI> or <HI>Mingrelia.</HI> Prince <HI>Vomeki</HI> retir'd among&s;t the <HI>Souanes</HI> into the Fortre&s;&s;es of Mount <HI>Cauca&s;us,</HI> inacce&s;&s;ible to the Cavalry. So that the <HI>Georgian</HI> Prince had nothing to do but to Ran&s;ack; and he carry'd away a very Rich Booty out of both Countries. They report that it was there that he plunder'd the greate&s;t part of the Gold and Silver Plate, of which his Hou&s;e is full. He &s;ettl'd in <HI>Mingrelia</HI> his Nephew, <HI>Levan</HI>'s Grand-Child, to whom the Principality belong'd of Right, and affianc'd him to one of his Nieces whom he promis'd to &s;end him. Which done, he caus'd his Son <HI>Archylus</HI> to be Crown'd King of <HI>Imiretta;</HI> but he knew not how to be rid of <HI>Vomeki.</HI> For he was unwilling to leave him a Fugitive in the Mountains where he was retir'd, fearing le&s;t when he was gone, he &s;hould come down from the Mountains, and di&s;turb the un&s;ettled affairs of Princes hardly warm in their Thrones. But a Grandee of <HI>Imiretta</HI> who&s;e Name was <HI>Kotzia,</HI> put him out of that pain. For he wrore to the <HI>Souanes,</HI> that the <HI>Viceroy</HI> of <HI>Georgia</HI> de&s;ir'd to rid him&s;elf ab&s;olutely of <HI>Vomeki:</HI> that he would give 'em great Rewards and Immunities if they brought him his Head: but if they deny'd to gratifie him in &s;o &s;mall a Matter, he threaten'd their Country with Fire and Sword. The <HI>Souanes</HI> therefore readily conde&s;cended, and having &s;lain <HI>Vomeki,</HI> &s;ent his Head to the <HI>Georgian</HI> Prince. Which done he retreated, and carry'd along with him the two Blind Princes <HI>Bacrat,</HI> and <HI>Vactangle;</HI> to the end no Friend of theirs in his ab&s;ence might be embolden'd to undertake any new di&s;turbances in their Favour; and left the

Prince&s;&s;es their Wives at <HI>Cotatis.</HI> Which Inhuman &s;eparations he made for the &s;ake of his Son the King of <HI>Imiretta;</HI> who became &s;o de&s;perately in Love with <HI>Bacrat</HI>'s Wife, that he re&s;olv'd to take her from her Husband and Marry her.</P>
<P>After the departure of the <HI>Viceroy of Georgia,</HI> &s;everal Grandees of <HI>Imiretta</HI> con&s;pir'd again&s;t their new Soveraign. For &s;ome had been ill us'd; others could not brook the Power and high advancement of <HI>Kotzia,</HI> whom <HI>Archylus</HI>'s Father had appoin|ted to be his Sons Prime Mini&s;ter, nor his Domineering Haugh|tine&s;s and &s;everity towards 'em. Thereupon they wrote to the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of <HI>Akalzike,</HI> that they wonderd to &s;ee him &s;it &s;till with &s;o much indifferency, while the <HI>Viceroy</HI> of <HI>Georgia</HI> ravag'd a Kingdom and Principality Tributary to the <HI>Turks;</HI> nay, re|duc'd 'em under his Subjection, and carry'd away their Lawful Princes Pris'ners, and &s;et up in their Places his own Friends and Kindred. That therefore they be&s;ought him to let 'em know, whether it were the <HI>Port</HI> that abandon'd 'em to the Capricious Humours of the <HI>Per&s;ians;</HI> or whether it were the Dread of their Forces, that ty'd his Hands at a time when the Honour and Intere&s;t of the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> lay at Stake. To which the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> return'd for an&s;wer, That he had &s;ent Intel|ligence to the <HI>Port</HI> of the Inva&s;ion made by the <HI>Georgian Vice|roy,</HI> and expected Orders every Hour; which when he &s;hould receive, he would let 'em know what was nece&s;&s;ary to be done. Soon after he wrote word that his Orders were come; and that as &s;oon as the Forces which the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI>'s of <HI>Erzerom</HI> and <HI>Carrs</HI> (both <HI>Provinces</HI> of <HI>Armenia)</HI> had In&s;tructions to &s;end him, &s;hould be joyn'd with his, he would deliver 'em from the <HI>Georgian</HI> Yoke. That in the mean time they &s;hould get ready to joyn with him with all the Forces they could rai&s;e, and that they &s;hould cau&s;e <HI>Kotzia</HI> to be murder'd, for fear his Forces, his Prudence and his Reputation &s;hould put a &s;top to the Enterprize, and that by his Death the new King of <HI>Imiretta</HI> might be without any Coun&s;ellor to a&s;&s;i&s;t him.</P>
<P>The Chief Con&s;pirators were the Grand Steward of the Hou&s;hold, and Bi&s;hop <HI>Janatelle;</HI> who al&s;o admitted into their Plot one of <HI>Kotzia</HI>'s Gentlemen: promi&s;ing him withal the Grand Ma&s;ter's Daughter in Marriage, and to prevail with the <HI>Turki&s;h Ba&s;ha,</HI> that he &s;hould have all his Ma&s;ter <HI>Kotzia</HI>'s Land, if he would but undertake to kill him, and perform it effectually: Which Conditions the perfidious Villain accepted, and one Night A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated his Ma&s;ter, at what time a certain Purge that he had tak'n wrought upon his Body.</P>

<P>As for the Orders which the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> had receiv'd from the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> the purport of 'em was, That &s;ince the Peo|ple of <HI>Imiretta</HI> and <HI>Mingrelia</HI> made u&s;e of their Liberty only to de&s;troy one another, he &s;hould take from 'em all the Strong Places he could. The <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> had kept his In&s;tructions very &s;ecret; and having by a Stratagem got admittance into the Ca|&s;tle of <HI>Cotatis,</HI> he made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of it, and furni&s;h'd it with a good Gari&s;on. Afterwards he &s;ent for all the Nobility and Gentry of the Country, and made 'em &s;wear Fealty to the new King which he gave 'em, who was the Son of the Prince of <HI>Guriel,</HI> at that time a <HI>Berre,</HI> or Monk of the Order of St. <HI>Ba&s;il;</HI> but he quitted his Mona&s;tical Habit, and was Crown'd King.</P>
<P>While the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> was thus di&s;po&s;ing of the Petty Kingdom of <HI>Imiretta,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Mingrelia</HI> came to waite upon him, with the offer of his Head, and Tender of his Subjection to the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s Commands. That he was and would &s;till continue a Tributary to the Court; and that the Prince of <HI>Georgia</HI> in e&s;tabli&s;hing him, had done no more then re&s;tor'd him the Patrimony of his Ance&s;tors, which appertain'd to him of Right. The <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> was appeas'd by his Submi&s;&s;ion, and by the great Pre&s;ents which he brought along with him. So that he confirm'd him in his Principality, and then return'd to <HI>Akalzike,</HI> carrying along with him the Wretched <HI>Darejan,</HI> and the Queen of <HI>Imiretta,</HI> whom the Unfortunate <HI>Archilus</HI> had not time to get into his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="81">
This happen'd in the Year 1659. at what time the Turki&s;h <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> had no &s;ooner turned his Back, but the Grandees of <HI>Imi|retta,</HI> out of their natural Treachery and Incon&s;tancy, refus'd to obey their new King. Thereupon they &s;ent Commi&s;&s;ioners to the <HI>Viceroy</HI> of <HI>Georgia,</HI> with their Complaints again&s;t him; and conjur'd him, to &s;end 'em back <HI>Bacrat,</HI> as Blind as he was. The <HI>Georgian</HI> Prince was afraid that this demand was no more then only an Artifice of their Treachery, and therefore to a&s;|certain him&s;elf of the Truth, he made An&s;wer, That if the Grandees of <HI>Imiretta</HI> were really, as they &s;aid they were, in|cens'd again&s;t their new Ma&s;ter, and re&s;olv'd to dethrone him, that they &s;hould pull out his Eyes, and that then when he was a&s;&s;ur'd they had done it, he would &s;end away <HI>Bacrat:</HI> Which Conditions were accepted and punctually perform'd both on one &s;ide and t' other. The Grandees of <HI>Imiretta</HI> pull'd out their Kings Eyes, and &s;ent him back to the Prince of <HI>Gu|riel</HI> his Brother; and the <HI>Viceroy</HI> of <HI>Georgia</HI> &s;ent 'em <HI>Ba|crat,</HI> after he had affianc'd him to one of his Nieces, Si&s;ter to her, whom he had given to the Prince of <HI>Mingrelia.</HI></P>
<P>This latter was very Young, and <HI>Bacrat</HI> was Blind: &s;o that their principal Officers Govern'd; and thence it came to pa&s;s that the Prime Mini&s;ters of <HI>Mingrelia</HI> and <HI>Imiretta</HI> had continual Quarrels one with another, wherein they engag'd their Ma|&s;ters, and oblig'd 'em to make War one upon another. In which Conte&s;t the <HI>Mingrelian</HI> was Vanqui&s;h'd and taken Pri&s;o|ner with his Wife, whom the <HI>Viceroy</HI> of <HI>Georgia</HI> had &s;ent him not above two Months before, and a report was afterwards &s;pread abroad, that he had not con&s;ummated the Marriage. She is very fair and very well &s;hap'd, and tho I have &s;een many hand&s;ome Women in her Country, I never beheld a more charming Creature. She is mo&s;t &s;urely guilty of all the Pa&s;|&s;ions that a Lovers Brea&s;t can feel. For &s;uch are the Glances of her pa&s;&s;ionately Tender and Langui&s;hing Eyes, that &s;he never looks but to command Love, and in&s;pire hope. In a word, the Air of her Countenance and all her di&s;cour&s;es are ir|re&s;i&s;table Allurements. So that Bi&s;hop <HI>Janatelle,</HI> who is one of the greate&s;t Lords in all <HI>Imiretta,</HI> was taken with her at fir&s;t &s;ight. Who being very Rich, ply'd her with Pre&s;ents, and gain'd her &s;o entirely, that now &s;he &s;ticks clo&s;e to him, and that &s;o publickly, as if they were Man and Wife. And indeed the cunning which this Prie&s;t made u&s;e of to retain this lovely Pris'ner &s;till in <HI>Imiretta,</HI> was more then u&s;ual, and a very plea&s;ant Contrivance. For he made the King his Ma&s;ter, the
<PB N="144" REF="82">
poor Blind <HI>Bacrat,</HI> in Love with her, by means of the dayly Encomiums of her Beauty which he continually peal'd in his Ears, and when he had kindl'd his Flame, he lay'd before him a kind of nece&s;&s;ity of Marrying her. <HI>Your Maje&s;ty,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>has lo&s;t your Wife, as being carry'd away by the Ba&s;ha of</HI> Akal|zike, <HI>&s;o that GOD knows what is become of her. The</HI> Viceroy <HI>of</HI> Georgia<HI>'s Niece, to whom you are affianc'd, is an Infant, &s;o that it will be a long time before you can be Marry'd to her. And therefore your Maje&s;ty will do well to e&s;pou&s;e the Prince&s;s of</HI> Min|grelia, <HI>nor can you any where Marry another, that has more Beauty, or more Wit.</HI> And thus the King being over-rul'd, follow'd his Coun&s;el, never con&s;idering that he acted more for the Intere&s;t of his Advizer then his own. And as for the Prince&s;s &s;he was glad of the Bargain.</P>
<P>'Tis well known that the Prince of <HI>Mingrelia</HI> lov'd her en|tirely, and that he would never con&s;ent to &s;urrender her to the King of <HI>Imiretta.</HI> And therefore an Expedient was found out to take her away under the pretence of Ju&s;tice, which was this. The King of <HI>Imiretta</HI> had her Si&s;ter with him; being at that time a Widow; and it was propos'd to her to make her Prince&s;s of <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> in &s;tead of her that was &s;o already, provided &s;he could but allure the Prince, and &s;o order it, as that he &s;hould be &s;urpriz'd in her Bed. She being the Si&s;ter of a King, Young, Cunning, and Hand&s;om, with little or no trouble ea&s;ily debauch'd a Young, Simple and Captive Prince. So that being both taken in Bed together, the Prince was forc'd to Marry her immediately, and at the &s;ame time the King of <HI>Imiretta</HI> e&s;pous'd the Prince&s;s of <HI>Mingrelia.</HI> The&s;e two Mar|riages thus accompli&s;h'd, the <HI>Mingrelian</HI> had his Liberty, and was re&s;tor'd to his Country, after he had &s;worn upon all the Images, never to repudiate his new Spou&s;e, nor to Marry any other, &s;o long as &s;he liv'd.</P>
<P>But &s;o &s;oon as he was return'd into his Country, de&s;ire of Revenge tran&s;porting him, he Challeng'd alike both the <HI>Turk</HI> and the <HI>Per&s;ian.</HI> He &s;ent his Amba&s;&s;adors to the Viceroy of <HI>Georgia,</HI> and the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of <HI>Akalzik&egrave;,</HI> Complaining of the In|va&s;ion which the King of <HI>Imiretta</HI> had made into his Country, and of his taking from him his Wife. The <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> was at that time highly provok'd again&s;t the People of <HI>Imiretta,</HI> for their Treachery, Rebellion and Cruelty to the King which he had appointed for their Soveraign. The Prince of <HI>Guriel</HI> al&s;o, Bro|ther to that Unfortunate Prince, loudly demanded Ju&s;tice. And the Cruel <HI>Darejan</HI> inflam'd his Revenge with all her
<PB N="145" REF="82">
might; and urg'd him to extend it to the utmo&s;t Rigour that &s;uch dete&s;table Inhumanities de&s;erv'd. Now &s;he was lovely, as I have already &s;aid, and her Beauty &s;trangely reinforc'd her Arguments. In&s;omuch that the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> promis'd to re&s;tore her to the Throne of <HI>Imiretta,</HI> together with her Husband, if &s;he could get him out of <HI>Georgia</HI> where he was a Pris'ner, in the Cu&s;tody of the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Gori;</HI> from whence the wily <HI>Darejan</HI> found a way to have him &s;toll'n and brought to <HI>Akalzik&egrave;.</HI> So &s;oon as he was arriv'd, the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> took 'em both along with him in his March to <HI>Imiretta;</HI> where he &s;ackt and ruin'd after a mo&s;t terrible manner all before him. Where|upon the King and Queen fled to a Fortre&s;s call'd <HI>Ratchia,</HI> &s;eated in an inacce&s;&s;ible part of the Mountains. After that, the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> re&s;tor'd <HI>Darejan</HI> and her Husband to the Throne, and caus'd all the Grandees, and all the People to &s;wear Feal|ty to him; and &s;o taking Ho&s;tages, he return'd with a great Number of Slaves; but little other Booty, in regard it had been no le&s;s then the third time in five Years that that poor Country had been pillag'd, plunder'd and ran&s;ack'd by the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> and their other Neighbours.</P>
<P>As for the wicked <HI>Darejan,</HI> &s;he was de&s;tin'd to be ruin'd by her exce&s;s of Confidence. One of her great Lords having lull'd her into a be&s;otted Credulity, had plung'd her, as I have already related, into one of the mo&s;t mi&s;erable Conditi|ons that could befal a Woman of her Quality; and now ano|ther by the &s;ame means brought her to the mo&s;t Tragick end in the World. This was the mo&s;t perfidious Traytor and Mur|derer of the Prime Mini&s;ter <HI>Cotzia,</HI> who was al&s;o call'd by the &s;ame Name. For the Murder he had committed had rais'd him to great Preferment. Now this Per&s;on never came near the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> to pay him his Homage, becau&s;e he had been of the Faction contrary to <HI>Darejan;</HI> and was therefore afraid of be|ing &s;acrific'd. However, he wrote to the Prince&s;s, as &s;oon as the <HI>Turks</HI> were retreated, and &s;ent her word, that <HI>Bacrat,</HI> and they by whom the Prince &s;till &s;uffer'd him&s;elf to be Govern'd, had put upon him &s;o many ingrateful Slights and Affronts, that he would be their vow'd Enemy as long as he liv'd: That if &s;he would engage to re&s;tore him to the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI>'s Favour, and to all his Lands that had been Confi&s;cated, and to inve&s;t him in the E&s;tate of the High Steward of <HI>Bacrat</HI>'s Hou&s;hold, he would deliver into her Hands both <HI>Bacrat</HI> and his Wife. All which &s;he promis'd to perform; and then the Traytor came and &s;ubmitted him&s;elf to her. At what time the <HI>Prince&s;s</HI> was
<PB N="146" REF="83">
&s;o over-ha&s;ty, that nothing would &s;erve her but &s;he would pre&s;ently be&s;tow upon him all the Marks of Favour and Re|conciliation, Friend&s;hip and Confidence, which are mo&s;t u&s;ual in that Country between Men and Women. She adopt|ed him therefore, and gave him the end of her Nipple to &s;uck. Which is a Cu&s;tom not only in <HI>Mingrelia, Georgia</HI> and <HI>Imiretta,</HI> but al&s;o in other the Neighbouring Countries, to adopt in that manner &s;uch Per&s;ons as they cannot unite to them&s;elves by Alliance. The Traytor having this Pledge of <HI>Darejan</HI>'s Faith, wrote to <HI>Bacrat</HI> to come with all his Party, and he would de|liver both her and her Husband into their Hands, either alive or dead. Now the &s;ame Day that <HI>Bacrat</HI> was to appear, the perfidious <HI>Cotzia</HI> kept his Bed, pretended him&s;elf &s;ick, and &s;ent to <HI>Darejan</HI> to vouch&s;afe him the Honour of a Vi&s;it, for that he had &s;ecret Intelligence to impart of that Importance, that he would not communicate to any but her &s;elf. Thus wheedl'd, away &s;he went, attended only by &s;ome of her Wo|men: but as &s;he was &s;itting by the Traytor's Bed, certain Fel|lows hid in the Room, fell upon her, and &s;eiz'd her Per&s;on, her Women in vain endeavouring to protect her. Yet there was one who took the <HI>Prince&s;s</HI> in her Arms, and run her up into a Corner of the Room, where &s;he &s;tuck by her, till the Murderers &s;tabb'd 'em both. With that <HI>Cotzia</HI> ro&s;e, and went with his Gang, where <HI>Darejan</HI>'s Husband lodg'd; a poor blind Man, uncapable of making any Re&s;i&s;tance. Him there|fore they &s;eiz'd, and <HI>Cotzia</HI> order'd him to be bound and kept till <HI>Bacrat</HI> came. Who was no &s;ooner arriv'd, but he demanded the Pris'ner, and hearing him approach, <HI>Traytor,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>thou wert the Occa&s;ion of putting out my Eyes, and I will tear out thy Heart.</HI> And &s;o &s;aying, he order'd him&s;elf to be carry'd near the Pris'ner, and then groping for his Brea&s;t, he gave him &s;e|veral Stabs with his Dagger. His Followers compleated the Murther by ripping open his Brea&s;t, and gave the poor Cap|tive's Heart into the Hands of the bloody &s;ightle&s;s <HI>Prince,</HI> who for above an Hour held it in his Clutches, gra&s;ping and tear|ing it with an unheard-of Tran&s;port of Fury.</P>
<P>The&s;e Barbarous Tragedies happen'd in the Year 1667. from which time till the Year 1672, there fell out a Hunderd more in the &s;ame Countries, altogether as Infamous and Inhu|mane: and therefore I pa&s;s 'em over in &s;ilence, as being Stories rather frightful then plea&s;ing to the Ear. I &s;hall only add thus much, that the Traytor <HI>Cotzia</HI> was him&s;elf al&s;o Treache|rou&s;ly &s;lain; and in a &s;hort time after the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins them&s;elves

were al&s;o kill'd at the Battel of <HI>Chicaris,</HI> which is a great Vil|lage within &s;ight of <HI>Scander,</HI> a Fortre&s;s of <HI>Imiretta,</HI> where the Forces of that Country, and the Prince of <HI>Mingrelia</HI> met. By which we may find there is a Vi&s;ible Providence in the Mo|dern Hi&s;tories of the&s;e Impious People; upon whom Heav'n &s;till inflicted &s;uch &s;evere and &s;peedy Ju&s;tice: while the Mur|derers are always A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, and with tho&s;e Circum&s;tances which plainly demon&s;trate that God had a Hand in it, and made the one his In&s;truments to puni&s;h the other.</P>
<P>In the Year 1672, the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of <HI>Akalzike,</HI> perceiving there was no end of Warring between tho&s;e two Petty Soveraigns of <HI>Mingrelia</HI> and <HI>Imeretta,</HI> neither by Accommodations nor Re|mon&s;trances, nor by Commands or Threats, re&s;olv'd to exter|minate 'em, and give their Country to others that better de|&s;erv'd it. He had then in his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion the true and Law|ful Heir of <HI>Mingrelia.</HI> For when <HI>Vomeki Dadian</HI> was ad|vanc'd to the Throne of that Kingdom, the Wife of <HI>Alexander</HI> the Son of <HI>Levan,</HI> fearing le&s;t the Ambitious <HI>Chilakite,</HI> the Mother of <HI>Vomeki</HI> &s;hould Murder <HI>Alexander</HI>'s Son, &s;he fled and carry'd the Infant with her. This Prince&s;s was Si&s;ter to the Prince of <HI>Guriel,</HI> who apprehen&s;ive al&s;o le&s;t the <HI>Chilakites</HI> fury &s;hould bring a War upon him, if he &s;hould &s;helter the little Infant, adviz'd her to carry him to the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of <HI>Akalzike.</HI> Which &s;he did; &s;o that the young Prince was brought up in the City of <HI>Akalzike,</HI> under the Eye of the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> him&s;elf. Who never de&s;ir'd him to change his Religion; believing it &s;ufficient to give him &s;uch an Education as &s;hould infu&s;e into him a deep Tincture of the Cu&s;toms and Manners of the <HI>Turks.</HI> Upon the&s;e con&s;iderations therefore the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of <HI>A|kalzike</HI> re&s;olv'd to &s;ettle this young Prince in <HI>Mingrelia;</HI> as well in regard the Principality belong'd to him as his Right, as for that he had &s;ome rea&s;on to hope that he would Govern it well, and root out tho&s;e abominable Cu&s;toms that had over run it: and this was the rea&s;on of the coming of the <HI>Turks</HI> into <HI>Min|grelia.</HI> The Prince of <HI>Guriel</HI> al&s;o joyn'd with the <HI>Ba&s;ha,</HI> as being overjoy'd at the advancement of his Nephew, to the Soveraignty: for he was in hopes of a Thou&s;and Advantages from the &s;ucce&s;s of this Enterprize. Pre&s;ently the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> Thun|der's into <HI>Imiretta,</HI> and makes him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of the Country; and of the Per&s;on of the King But the Queen his Spou&s;e was not &s;eiz'd. For her Bi&s;hop <HI>Janatel,</HI> gave Fifteen Thou&s;and Crowns to the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> that he might have Liberty to carry her
<PB N="148" REF="84">
where he pleas'd; and that he might have the favour to pre|&s;erve his own Lands and Tenements, from &s;poil and Ran&s;ack.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> came to <HI>Cotatis,</HI> he &s;ent to the <HI>Dadian,</HI> which is the Title given to the Prince of <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> to come and pay him Homage. But the <HI>Dadian,</HI> under&s;tanding the Alte|ration of Government which he intended to make in <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> refus'd to obey him, and &s;hut him&s;elf up in his Fortre&s;s of <HI>Rucks.</HI> His <HI>Vizier Carzia</HI> fled into <HI>Lexicom,</HI> which is a Prin|cipality in the Mountains inhabited by the <HI>Souanes,</HI> and from thence &s;ent to the <HI>Abca</HI>'s to &s;uccour <HI>Dadian.</HI> Tis true, they march'd into <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> but in&s;tead of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Prince, they pillag'd all the Country in their March, and then retreat|ed back again. As for the <HI>Ba&s;ha,</HI> after he had &s;tay'd a Month in vain, expecting the <HI>Dadians</HI> coming to pay him Homage, and receive his Orders, he &s;ent his Army into <HI>Mingrelia.</HI> And the noi&s;e of the march of this Army it was, that oblig'd me to betake my &s;elf to flight.</P>
<P>The 27th before Day, the Superiour of the <HI>Theatins</HI> left us, and return'd home to his Hou&s;e to &s;ee if he could remove any thing of that Hou&s;hold Stuff and Provi&s;ions which remain'd behind. I would have been glad to have accompany'd him upon the &s;ame de&s;ign; but he was gone two Hours before Day. But when he came to his Hou&s;e, he found it full of the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI>'s, and the Prince of <HI>Guriel</HI>'s avant-Couriers, who entertain'd him but very rudely with their Cudgels and Iron Maces. The&s;e Free-Booters would have had him open'd the Church, pretending he had hid his Goods in it. But the Superiour had warily thrown the Key among the Bu&s;hes when he fir&s;t per|ciev'd the Souldiers, &s;o that notwith&s;tanding all the Violence they could offer him, he deny'd he had it, and would never di&s;cover where it was. At length the <HI>Turks</HI> having &s;ome Con&s;ideration for his Character, took from him a part of his Habits, and carry'd away only &s;ome &s;light things of the great|e&s;t Value they found in the Hou&s;e, not &s;o much as medling either with my Books or my Papers.</P>
<P>But the 29th at Night came a Gentleman of <HI>Mingrelia</HI> with a Party of Thirty Followers, and cut all to pieces. He un|cover'd almo&s;t all my Chamber, believing I had hidd'n many Things in it. He carry'd away the Remainder of the Copper Ware, my Che&s;ts, and large Moveables; and in a word, whatever the <HI>Turks</HI> and I had left, as being of no great Va|lue, and heavy for Carriage be&s;ide. This Tygre, as I &s;aid,
<PB N="149" REF="84">
came by Night, and therefore for want of a Candle he &s;et Fire on my Papers and Books, and tore off the Covers, becau&s;e they were Gilt, and mark'd with Coats of Arms. For I had cau&s;ed my Books to be very curiou&s;ly Bound at my departure from <HI>Paris.</HI> But they left me not &s;o much as a Sheet of Paper.</P>
<P>The 30th in the Morning I had notice of my being Plun|der'd, to my un&s;peakable &s;orrow. And in the Evening came a Turki&s;h <HI>Chiaux</HI> to the Fortre&s;s where I was, to let us know that he came from the <HI>Ba&s;ha. Sabatar</HI> (for &s;o was the Gentle|man call'd to whom it belong'd, as I have already declar'd) went forth to receive the Me&s;&s;age. Which imported, that the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI>'s Lieutenant who lay before the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Rucks</HI> ad|mir'd, that he did not come and &s;ubmit him&s;elf to him, and pay him his Homage, &s;ince that <HI>Mingrelia</HI> belong'd to the <HI>Grand Signior;</HI> that the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> had order'd that they &s;hould be civilly us'd, who joyn'd them&s;elves with the <HI>Turks;</HI> but that they &s;hould be dealt with as Enemies, who refus'd to &s;ubmit: that if he intended to &s;ave his E&s;tate, his Life, his Ca&s;tle, and all that was in it, he &s;hould make ha&s;te to receive the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI>'s Orders. To which <HI>Sabatar</HI> made An&s;wer, that he acknow|ledg'd the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> for his Lord, and that in his Heart he was a <HI>Turk</HI> and not a <HI>Mingrelian;</HI> that he had re&s;olv'd to attend the <HI>Ba&s;ha,</HI> &s;o &s;oon as he under&s;tood that it was proper for him to attend his Lord&s;hip; and now that he under&s;tood that his Lieu|tenant lay before <HI>Rucks,</HI> he would go the next Morning to receive his Orders.</P>
<P>The 31&s;t the Gentleman went with Thirty Men well Arm'd to wait upon the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI>'s Lieutenant, carrying along with him a Pre&s;ent of Four Slaves, a Silver Cup, together with a Quantity of Silk, Wax and Vittles for Refre&s;hment. That Evening he arriv'd at the Camp, where he found &s;eve|ral Lords of <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> who were come, as he was, to &s;ubmit them&s;elves, for fear of being Be&s;ieg'd, and of having their Ca|&s;tles and Lands plunder'd and demoli&s;h'd. The Lieutenant told him that the Orders which his Ma&s;ter had receiv'd from the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> his Ma&s;ter, were to de&s;troy all the &s;trong places in <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> however that he would pre&s;erve the Ca&s;tles of &s;uch Lords as pre&s;erv'd them&s;elves in their Loyalty and Obe|dience. That the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> had taken away the Princi|pality from <HI>Levan,</HI> who was at <HI>Rucks,</HI> and had conferr'd it upon a Young Prince, who was bred up at <HI>Akalzik&egrave;,</HI> and that he mu&s;t &s;wear Allegiance to him, and give one of his Childern in Ho&s;tage for his Fidelity; and make a Pre&s;ent to the <HI>Ba&s;ha.</HI>
<PB N="150" REF="85">
Now the Pre&s;ent which <HI>Sabatar</HI> agreed to make, was Ten Young Slaves of both Sexes, and Three Hundred Crowns either in Silver or in Silk.</P>
<P>The Fir&s;t of <HI>October, Sabatar</HI> return'd, and brought along with him a Protection from the <HI>Turk,</HI> for his Ca&s;tle and for all his Lands. All that night he be&s;tirr'd him&s;elf to get ready the Pre&s;ent which he was to carry. To which purpo&s;e he &s;ig|nifi'd to all that were fled for Refuge to his Ca&s;tle or Fortre&s;s, that the <HI>Turks</HI> had given him a Protection, for Twenty Five Slaves, and Eight Hundred Crowns, which he mu&s;t Levy up|on tho&s;e that were retir'd under his &s;ecurity. So that from every Family that had Four Children he took one: which was the mo&s;t lamentable &s;pectacle in the World, to &s;ee little Childern torn from the Arms of their Mothers, ty'd two and two together, and carry'd away to the <HI>Turks:</HI> For my own part I was tax'd at Twenty Crowns.</P>
<P>However, <HI>Sabatar</HI> did not carry any more to the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI>'s Lieutenant, then what they two had agreed between them|&s;elves: the re&s;t he appropriated to him&s;elf. Nor could his Wives, his Childern and all the Ca&s;tle forbear loud Cries of &s;orrow when they &s;aw his Young Son carry'd away among the re&s;t. For tho&s;e Childern which are given in Ho&s;tage to the <HI>Turk,</HI> are no le&s;s his Slaves: He never parts with 'em; as be|ing u&s;ually &s;ent to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> to encrea&s;e the Multitude of tho&s;e hand&s;ome young Childern that are bred up in the <HI>Se|raglio.</HI> The <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI>'s Lieutenant receiv'd the Pre&s;ent and the Ho&s;tage, and &s;till detain'd <HI>Sabatar</HI> with him neverthele&s;s. He al&s;o &s;ummon'd the <HI>Dadian</HI> Three times to &s;urrender, but the Prince refus'd. For his Fortre&s;s was well guarded by the <HI>Sou|anes,</HI> which his Vizier had &s;ent him, and who were more the Ma&s;ters of it then him&s;elf: be&s;ides that the Vizier &s;ent him word every Day that he &s;hould hold out, and that he would be ready in a &s;hort time to pour down upon the Enemy. At la&s;t the <HI>Turks</HI> after they had &s;tay'd about Four Days before <HI>Rucks,</HI> and got above Two Thou&s;and Slaves and much Booty, rais'd their Siege: for they had no great Guns, which was the rea&s;on they did not attack the Ca&s;tle. They al&s;o carry'd along with 'em all the <HI>Mingrelian</HI> Lords that came to &s;urrender them|&s;elves, and had &s;worn Allegiance to the new Prince. The <HI>Catholicos</HI> was among the number of tho&s;e that had tak'n the Oath. Whom the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> order'd to be made Vizier to the new Prince, and that they &s;hould &s;end in his Name to the Prince of the <HI>Abca</HI>'s, to demand the Prince&s;s his Daughter in Mar|riage.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="85">
It was thought that the coming of the <HI>Turk</HI> into <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> would have re&s;ettl'd all things in order, and re&s;tor'd Peace and Tranquillity, by cau&s;ing all Parties to lay down their Arms. But it did not &s;o fall out: they only came and plunder'd the Country; but put it into more confu&s;ion then it was be|fore. For they divided it into two Parties; of which the one was engag'd by Oath and Ho&s;tages to the new Prince, the other &s;tuck fa&s;t to their depos'd Soveraign: Which Divi&s;ion made every one betake them&s;elves to their Arms. Seeing therefore the Affairs of the Country in this mi&s;erable condition &s;o far from any Accommodation, I took a re&s;olution to get into <HI>Georgia</HI> by any manner of way, or whatever the hazard might be. For I ran tho&s;e Ri&s;co's every Day in <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> that I expected nothing at length but to be utterly ruin'd. <HI>Levan</HI> threatn'd Ruine and De&s;truction to the Ca&s;tles, Goods and Lands of the Lords who had &s;urrender'd to the <HI>Turks: Sabatar</HI> was &s;till in Cu&s;tody: and his Sons that commanded in the Ca&s;tle, were the greare&s;t Cut-throats and accompli&s;h'd Rogues in the World. I langui&s;h'd every Day with &s;orrow and want. It was a Man's whole bu&s;ine&s;s to buy a handful of Grain, and a Pound of Vittles; and I &s;uffer'd in my Oven all the Injuries of Weather, as if I had been in the open Field: the de&s;pair of my Ser|vants went to my Heart; in a word, I was at the brink of Death. Which was that which induc'd me to venture all hazards to get my &s;elf rid of <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> while I had &s;trength and Ability to do it. To that purpo&s;e I &s;ought every where for Guides; promis'd, entreated, lay'd down my Money, but nothing would do; there was no body that would be my Conductor. The Armies they &s;aid, lay &s;o thick upon the Roads of <HI>Imiretta,</HI> the Country between <HI>Mingrelia</HI> and <HI>Georgia,</HI> through which I was of nece&s;&s;ity to pa&s;s, that it was a meer folly to venture, where a man was a&s;&s;ur'd he could not e&s;cape being made a Slave. And the&s;e were all the An&s;wers they made me. I propos'd the fetching a Compa&s;s either over Mount <HI>Cauca&s;us</HI> or along the Sea Coa&s;t, but no body would undertake the Journey.</P>
<P>'Tis an incredible thing to think how fearful the <HI>Mingrelians</HI> are of Death, or of being undone; there is no Reward can prevail with 'em to run the Ri&s;co of a known Danger, how incon&s;iderable &s;oever it be. At length I was con&s;train'd to take the way by Sea, and through <HI>Turkey,</HI> that is to &s;ay, to fetch a Compa&s;s of Seventy Leagues. To that purpo&s;e I went to <HI>Anarghia,</HI> a Village and &s;mall Sea-Port, of which I have
<PB N="152" REF="86">
already &s;pok'n. There I found a Felouque of the <HI>Turks,</HI> which I hir'd for <HI>Gonia:</HI> &s;o that when I had giv'n Earne&s;t, I return'd to the <HI>Theatins</HI> Hou&s;e, and to <HI>Sabatar</HI>'s Ca&s;tle, to prepare for my Voyage.</P>
<P>The Tenth of <HI>November</HI> early in the Morning I departed from the Ca&s;tle, having agreed with my Comrade what ways I would take to recover him out of <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> if it pleas'd GOD to grant me a happy Voyage. I carry'd along with me Eight Thou&s;and Pounds in Jewels, and Eight Hunderd Pi|&s;tols in Gold, with the few &s;mall Packs that were left me. The Jewels were hid in a Saddle contriv'd for that purpo&s;e, and in a Pillow: and I took a Servant along with me, the &s;ame whom I had redeem'd out of Slavery. This was a con|ceal'd Rogue; a Traytor who&s;e Villany was not well di&s;co|ver'd by me. I was advis'd not to take him along with me for fear of &s;ome Impo&s;ition, or &s;ome wicked Trick that his very Countenance told 'em he would play me; nor was I well re&s;olv'd with my &s;elf to be troubl'd with him; but my Fortune would have it &s;o, and I could not prevent it. But the Rea&s;ons that prevail'd with me more then any other to take him, was, that he brook'd his bad Condition like one that was mad or in de&s;pair; and I was afraid le&s;t in one of his mad or drunk'n Fits (to which he was &s;ubject) he &s;hould di&s;cover us in <HI>Mingrelia.</HI> Fryer <HI>Zampi,</HI> the Superiour of the <HI>Theatins,</HI> bore me Company as he had done all along. And the Lay-Brother undertook to Conduct me to <HI>Anarghia.</HI> The Superiour and I went afoot, becau&s;e we could not meet with more then one Hor&s;e to be hir'd for Money, upon which I loaded my Goods, and let my Servant ride to look after 'em. The Lay-Brother was al&s;o a Hor&s;eback, and it rain'd as hard as it could pour after two days; in&s;omuch that the Fryer had like to have been drown'd about a League from the Ca&s;tle in a deep Ditch that overflow'd its Banks, into which his Hor&s;e fell, and out of which with much ado we recover'd him half dead. I &s;hall not relate the Hard&s;hips I endur'd both that and the fol|lowing days: as being con&s;train'd to march afoot in a rainy &s;ea&s;on through the Woods, full of Water and Mud, where I went for the mo&s;t part up to the Knees: only in a word, that 'twas impo&s;&s;ible for any Per&s;on to endure more then we did. For my own part I was quite &s;pent: All that I had left was a remainder of Courage and Re&s;olution to do and &s;uffer what|ever befel me, to &s;ave tho&s;e Goods that were entru&s;ted to my Care. In the Evening we arriv'd at <HI>Anarghia</HI> wet to the
<PB N="153" REF="86">
very Skin; <HI>Anarghia</HI> being &s;ix Leagues from the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Sa|batar.</HI></P>
<P>The 12th I was to have Embark'd, but was prevented by the News that was &s;pread about of &s;everal Barks of the <HI>Mingre|lians</HI> and <HI>Abca</HI>'s that were Crui&s;ing upon the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Min|grelia.</HI> Which was very true; for they had taken &s;everal Barks of the Country, and one among the re&s;t wherein I was concern'd. Yet the un&s;peakable trouble which this delay gave me, did not proceed &s;o much from its keeping me in conti|nual Fears and Dangers, as that it &s;eem'd to threaten me that I &s;hould never get rid of 'em.</P>
<P>The 19th Father <HI>Zampi</HI> had Intelligence that the Day be|fore, they had forc'd open the Church-Doors, taken away all that was in the Church, had open'd the Sepulcher, and carry'd all that one of the <HI>Theatins,</HI> who was left to look af|ter the Hou&s;e, had hid in the Tomb, and that there was no|thing left &s;tanding but the Wall. This News put me into a terrible fright, con&s;idering I had left above Seven Thou&s;and <HI>Pi&s;tols</HI> buri'd in the Church. Upon which I di&s;patch'd away a Me&s;&s;enger to my Comrade, thinking to have found him at the Ca&s;tle; but he was already gone to the <HI>Theatins</HI> Re&s;i|dence, to know what cour&s;e we &s;hould take to repair &s;o great a Misfortune, of which he had Notice as &s;oon as my &s;elf. But he wrote me word, That Thanks be to GOD they had not &s;o much as touch'd our Money, having found it in the &s;ame place where we had buri'd it. VVhich good News wonderfully re|viv'd my Spirits, looking upon &s;o great a Favour of the Al|mighty as a &s;ign of his Attonement; &s;o that I went to encou|rage the <HI>Turks,</HI> who&s;e Feluke I had hir'd to &s;et Sail with all &s;peed.</P>
<P>The 27th I departed from <HI>Anarghia,</HI> my Feluke being a Ve&s;&s;el of good Burthen, wherein there were near Twenty Per&s;ons, the one half Slaves, the re&s;t <HI>Turks,</HI> which I the ra|ther permitted the Ma&s;ter to take in, that we might be the bet|ter able to defend our &s;elves again&s;t the Rovers that infe&s;ted the Coa&s;ts. After an Hours Sailing, we got into the Main Sea: For the <HI>Langur</HI> which we left is very rapid, and runs with a furious Stream; and be&s;ides, he mu&s;t be a skilful Pilot that carries a laden Ve&s;&s;el down that River, by rea&s;on of the many Flats, where they &s;tick upon the Sands. I &s;taid all Day|long near the Shoar at the reque&s;t of the Ma&s;ter of the Shal|lop, who expected two Slaves to be brought him that Even|ing.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="87">
While I tarry'd at <HI>Anarghia,</HI> I was invited to two Chri&s;t|nings; whither I went to ob&s;erve the manner of the <HI>Mingre|lian</HI> Bapti&s;m; and found that Father <HI>Zampi</HI> had been very exact in his Relation. For the Ceremony was no otherwi&s;e then thus, perform'd in a Neighbours Hou&s;e adjoyning to the Lodging where I lay. He &s;ent for the Prie&s;t about Ten a Clock in the Morning; who was no &s;ooner come, but he went into the Buttry where they kept the Wine, and &s;ate him|&s;elf down upon a Bench without any other then his ordinary Habit, and then fell a reading in a Book that was half torn, about the bigne&s;s of a New Te&s;tament in <HI>Octavo.</HI> Not that the Child was brought to him when he began to read, for the Father and Godfather did not bring him till a quarter of an Hour after; and then appear'd a little Boy of about five Years of Age, at what time the Godfather brought al&s;o a little Sear|ring Candle, and three Grains of Incen&s;e. The Candle the Godfather likewi&s;e lighted, and fix'd it to the Door of the Cellar, where though it was burnt out before the Child was Baptiz'd, they did not light up another; and as for the three Grains of Incen&s;e, they were &s;trew'd upon a few Embers, and &s;moak'd away. All this while the Prie&s;t read on, very fa&s;t, and with a low Voice, and in &s;uch a carele&s;s manner as if he never minded what he did. The Father and Godfather went to and agen all the time, and &s;o did the Child, that did nothing but eat. At length after an Hours reading, there was a Bucket of warm Water got ready; into which after the Prie&s;t had pour'd about a Spoonful of Oyl of Walnuts, he bid the Godfather undre&s;s the Child: which was done, and the Child put naked into the Bucket; where, as he &s;tood up|on his Feet, the Godfather wa&s;h'd his Body all over, and when he had well wa&s;h'd him, the Prie&s;t took out of a Lea|ther Pouch that hung at his Girdle as much <HI>Myrone,</HI> or Oyl of Unction, as came to the weight of a Pea, and gave it to the Godfather, who Anointed with it almo&s;t all the parts of the Childs Body; as the top of the Head, the Ears, Forehead, No&s;e, Cheeks, Chin, Shoulders, Elbows, Back, Belly, Knees and Feet: All which time the Prie&s;t read on &s;till; nor did he give over till the Godfather had again dre&s;t the Child. Which being done, the Father brought in Wine, Bread, and a piece of boyl'd Pork, and fir&s;t gave the Child to eat, then pre&s;ented the Prie&s;t, the Godfather, the Gue&s;ts, and all the Hou&s;e: and then they all &s;ate down to the Table; nor was there hardly one that was not drunk before he went.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="87">
I have al&s;o &s;een Ma&s;s perform'd in the &s;ame place: which is done with the &s;ame Carele&s;&s;ne&s;s and Irreverence, and alto|gether as has been related in a Treati&s;e of the <HI>Mingrelian</HI> Reli|gion. And once it was my hap to &s;ee one very plea&s;antly in|terrupted. For as I was flying with one of the <HI>Theatins,</HI> we pa&s;s'd along before a Church where they were &s;aying Ma&s;s. At what time the Prie&s;t that &s;aid it, under&s;tanding that we enquir'd the way of the People that &s;tood at the Door, <HI>Stay a little,</HI> cry'd he from the Altar, <HI>I'll come and tell ye.</HI> Imme|diately after he came to the Door, muttering his Ma&s;s between his Teeth, and after he had ask'd us whence we came and whi|ther we went, he &s;hew'd us the way, and &s;o return'd to the Altar again.</P>
<P>The 29th betimes i' the Morning we put to Sea, the wea|ther being clear and fair: and then we could di&s;cover the high Lands of <HI>Trebi&s;ond,</HI> on the one &s;ide, and of the <HI>Abca</HI>'s on the other, and that very ea&s;ily becau&s;e the <HI>Black Sea</HI> beginning to wind toward the <HI>Abca</HI>'s Coa&s;ts, <HI>Anarghia</HI> &s;tands far out in the circular circumference of tho&s;e Coa&s;ts an&s;wering to <HI>Trebi&s;ond.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Black-Sea</HI> is 200 Leagues in length wanting Twelve or Fifteen, lying ju&s;t Ea&s;t and We&s;t. The broade&s;t part, North and South, from the <HI>Bo&s;phorus</HI> with <HI>Bori&s;thenes,</HI> is three degrees; which part is the We&s;tern end of the Sea; the Oppo|&s;ite part not being above half &s;o broad. The Water of this Sea &s;eem'd to me le&s;s Clear, le&s;s Green, and le&s;s Salt, then the Water of the Ocean. Which proceeds as I am apt to be|lieve from the great Rivers that empty them&s;elves into it; and for that it is &s;hut up in its &s;elf as it were in the bottom of a Sack, &s;o that it ought to be more properly called a Lake then a Sea, like the <HI>Ca&s;pian Sea;</HI> With which it agrees in this, that is common to both, that in neither of the two Seas there are any I&s;lands. And therefore 'tis in vain to &s;eek for the rea&s;on of its Denomination from the colour of the Water. The <HI>Greeks</HI> gave it its Name from the Dangerous Navigation dayly experienc'd by tho&s;e that ventur'd into it; by rea&s;on of the Tempe&s;ts there more frequent and boi&s;trous then in other Seas: <HI>Axenos</HI> &s;ignifying inho&s;pitable, and that will not &s;uffer any Per&s;on to come near it. The <HI>Turks</HI> therefore for the &s;ame rea|&s;on call it <HI>Cara Denguis,</HI> or the <HI>Furious Sea. Cara</HI> which in the Turki&s;h Language properly &s;ignifies <HI>Black,</HI> denoting al&s;o furi|ous, dangerous, terrible, and &s;erving u&s;ually in that Idiom, for an Epithite given to thick Forre&s;ts, rapid Rivers, and &s;teep and rugged Mountains. Now the rea&s;on why the Storms are more
<PB N="156" REF="88">
Violent and Dangerous in that, then in other Seas, is fir&s;t be|cau&s;e the Waters are contracted within a narrow Channel and have no Outlet: the <HI>Bo&s;phorus</HI> not being to be accompted an Outlet by rea&s;on it is &s;o very &s;treight. And therefore the Waters being Violently agitated by a Storm, and not know|ing where to have Room, and being &s;trongly repell'd by the &s;hoar, they Mount and rowle aloft, and beat again&s;t the Ship on every &s;ide with an Invincible &s;wiftne&s;s and force. Second|ly, becau&s;e there are few or no Roads in that Sea which are &s;helter'd from the Wind, but where there is more danger then in the open Sea.</P>
<P>All the <HI>Black-Sea</HI> is under the Dominion of the <HI>Grand Sig|nior;</HI> there is no Sailing there without his leave; &s;o that there is no great fear of Pyrates, which in my Opinion are a greater danger then the Sea it &s;elf.</P>
<P>All that Day we &s;ayl'd with a Contrary Wind, which was the rea&s;on we did not make above Six Leagues, however in the Evening we bore into a River call'd <HI>Kelmhel,</HI> deeper and almo&s;t as broad as the <HI>Langur,</HI> but not &s;o rapid.</P>
<P>The 30th Two Hours before Day we &s;et &s;ail by the light of the Moon, and by Noon we made the River <HI>Pha&s;is,</HI> and bore up into it about a Mile to certain Hou&s;es, where the Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Feluke</HI> was de&s;irous to unlade &s;ome of his Goods.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Pha&s;is</HI> takes its ri&s;e out of Mount <HI>Cauca&s;us,</HI> call'd by the Turks <HI>Fachs;</HI> though as I ob&s;erv'd, the People of the Country call it <HI>Rione.</HI> I &s;aw it fir&s;t at <HI>Cotatis,</HI> where it runs in a narrow Channel very &s;wiftly, yet &s;ometimes &s;o low, that it is ea&s;ily fordable. But where it di&s;charges it &s;elf into the Sea, which is about Four&s;core and Ten Miles from <HI>Cotatis,</HI> there the Channel is about a Mile and Half Broad and Sixty Fadome deep: being &s;well'd before that, by &s;everal le&s;&s;er &s;treams that pour them&s;elves into it. The Water is very good to Drink, though &s;omewhat Muddy, thick, and of a Leaden colour; of which <HI>Arrian</HI> a&s;&s;erts the cau&s;e to be the Earth that is intermix'd with it. He farther adds, and other Authors al|&s;o affirm the &s;ame, that all the Ships took in Water at <HI>Pha&s;is,</HI> out of an Opinion that the River was &s;acred, or believing it to be the be&s;t Water in the World. There are &s;everal &s;mall I&s;lands at the Mouth of the River, which appear very delight|ful, as being &s;haded with thick Woods. Upon the bigge&s;t of which to the We&s;t, are to be &s;een the Ruins of a Fortre&s;s which <HI>Sultan Murat</HI> caus'd to be built in the Year 1578. For
<PB N="157" REF="88">
he had made an Attempt to Conquer all the Northern and Ea|&s;tern Coa&s;ts of the <HI>Black-Sea.</HI> But this Enterprize did not &s;ucceed according to his De&s;ign. For to that purpo&s;e he &s;ent his Galleys up the River <HI>Pha&s;is;</HI> but the King of <HI>Imiretta</HI> ha|ving laid con&s;iderable <HI>Embu&s;cado</HI>'s, where the River was nar|rowe&s;t, <HI>Murat</HI>'s Galleys were defeated, one &s;unk, and the re&s;t forc'd to fly. The Fortre&s;s of <HI>Pha&s;is</HI> was tak'n by the Army of the King of <HI>Imiretta,</HI> reinforc'd by the Prince's of <HI>Mingrelia</HI> and <HI>Guriel.</HI> The Ca&s;tle was pre&s;ently demoli&s;h'd, wherein there were 25 Pieces of Cannon, which the King caus'd to be carry'd to his Ca&s;tle of <HI>Cotatis,</HI> where they are now again in the Hands of the <HI>Turks</HI> by the late &s;urrender of the Ca&s;tle be|longing to that place.</P>
<P>I fetch'd a Compa&s;s about the I&s;land of <HI>Pha&s;is,</HI> to try whe|ther I could di&s;cover any Remainders of the Temple of <HI>Rhea,</HI> which <HI>Arrian</HI> &s;ays was to be &s;een in his time: but I could not find the lea&s;t Foot&s;tep of any &s;uch thing. Yet Hi&s;torians affirm, that it was &s;tanding entire in the time of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Empire: and that it was Con&s;ecrated to the Wor&s;hip of Chri&s;t in the Reign of the Emperour <HI>Zeno.</HI> I &s;ought likewi&s;e for the great City call'd <HI>Seba&s;ta,</HI> which Geographers have plac'd at the Mouth of <HI>Pha&s;is;</HI> but not a Brick to be &s;een, no more then of the Ruines of <HI>Colchis.</HI> All that I ob&s;erv'd conformable to what the Ancients have wrote concerning that part of the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI> is only this, That it abounds in Phea&s;ants. Of which there are &s;ome Authors, and among the re&s;t <HI>Martial,</HI> who &s;ay, That the <HI>Argonauts</HI> fir&s;t brought tho&s;e Birds into <HI>Greece,</HI> where they had never been &s;een before, and that they gave 'em the Name of Phea&s;ants, or <HI>Pha&s;iani,</HI> as being taken upon the Banks of <HI>Pha&s;is.</HI> This River &s;eparates <HI>Mingrelia</HI> from the Principality of <HI>Guriel,</HI> and the petty Kingdom of <HI>Imiretta. Anarghia</HI> is di&s;tant from it 36 Miles. All the Coa&s;t is a low Sandy Soyl, cover'd with Woods &s;o thick, that a Man can hardly &s;ee &s;ix Paces among the Trees.</P>
<P>In the Evening I caus'd the Ma&s;ter to put to Sea, with a fair Gale; and at Midnight we Sail'd before a Haven call'd <HI>Copoletta,</HI> belonging to the Prince of <HI>Guriel.</HI></P>
<P>The 30th after Noon, we arriv'd at <HI>Goni&egrave;,</HI> di&s;tant from <HI>Pha&s;is</HI> about 40 Miles; the Sea-Coa&s;t being all exceeding High-land, and Rocks, &s;ome cover'd with Wood, and others naked.

<P>So &s;oon as the Felouke came to be Moor'd to the Key, my Servant leap'd a&s;hoar with a mo&s;t extravagant Tran&s;port of Joy: he ca&s;t up his Eyes to Heav'n, ki&s;s'd the Earth; he be|&s;tow'd a Thou&s;and Cur&s;es upon <HI>Mingrelia;</HI> but to the Country of the <HI>Turks</HI> he wi&s;h'd all the Happine&s;s imaginable. Pre|&s;ently after, leaving me, he went into the Ca&s;tle, at a time that I had more need of him then ever. And indeed I had a great Jealou&s;ie that he was gone to di&s;cover as much as he thought he knew concerning me. For when the Officer of the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e and the Deputy-Governor came to take No|tice what was unladed out of the Felouke, and to demand the Cu&s;toms, they pre&s;ently gave me to under&s;tand, that they knew I was an <HI>European,</HI> told me the Misfortunes which had befall'n me in <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> and the De&s;ign which I had to go to <HI>Akalzik&egrave;.</HI> Which &s;urpriz'd me extreamly, perceiving &s;o well that I was betray'd. Neverthele&s;s I was not at all troubl'd at it; for GOD through his Mercy &s;till in&s;pir'd me with Re&s;olution. Be&s;ides, I was &s;ure of one thing, that my Servant did not know particularly who I was. I had entertain'd him into my
<PB N="159" REF="89">
&s;ervice 'tis true, at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and he had &s;een me frequent|ly Vi&s;it the <HI>European</HI> Amba&s;&s;adors and Mini&s;ters, and that I was honourably receiv'd, and that all the re&s;t of my time I &s;pent in Writing and Reading; &s;o that all he could gue&s;s from thence, was only that I might be &s;ome Per&s;on that Travell'd out of Curio&s;ity. I had given him In&s;tructions al&s;o to tell the <HI>Turks</HI> if they enquir'd, that I was a Merchant, and that be|ing come into <HI>Mingrelia</HI> to buy Hawks, to carry into <HI>Europe,</HI> the People of the Country had Robb'd me of all I had, and that I was going to demand Ju&s;tice from the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of <HI>Akal|zik&egrave;.</HI> And I kept con&s;tant to this Story, not knowing any better way to conceal my &s;elf; be&s;ides that I would not by any alteration of my In&s;tructions, &s;eem to take any notice to my Servant, that I was Jealous of his Infidelity. The Officer of the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e ask'd me &s;everal Que&s;tions; to which I gave him &s;atisfactory An&s;wers: however he &s;ent to &s;earch my Packs, but met with nothing: my Saddle indeed weigh'd &s;ome|what heavy, which caus'd it to be &s;u&s;pected; in regard that the Turki&s;h Saddles are very light. Whereupon the Officers Poys'd it and felt every where; but not feeling any thing but Flocks and Hair, they &s;uffer'd it to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>As for my Eight Hunderd <HI>Pi&s;tols,</HI> I carry'd the one half about me, the other was in a Portmantle lockt with a Padlock with &s;ome other Trifles that were of no Value; but which I knew well enough, the <HI>Turks</HI> would be fingring, had they once but fix'd their Eyes upon 'em. True it is, that when I parted from <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> I had re&s;olv'd to have given that Cloak Bag to one of the Seamen, &s;o &s;oon as we &s;hould land at <HI>Copoletta,</HI> a Neighbouring Port of which I have already &s;poken. For they never meddle with the Seamen's Packs, and very rarely &s;earch the <HI>Feloukes</HI> them&s;elves. But the Wind being fair, we never put in to that Port; which was the rea&s;on I did not do as I intended: for it would have been a piece of Imprudence to have done it publickly in the <HI>Felouk</HI> where there were &s;o many Pa&s;&s;engers.</P>
<P>The Officers of the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e therefore being inform'd of what I had, went into the <HI>Felouk</HI> and there finding the Cloak Bag, demanded who&s;e it was, to which I pre&s;ently an|&s;wer'd, that 'twas mine, but that there was nothing in it that pay'd Cu&s;tom. However, the Cu&s;tomer commanded me to open it: to which I reply'd, That I would willingly do it at his Hou&s;e, but not a &s;hoar before &s;o many People. There|upon the Officers carry'd me home, and the Deputy Gover|nor
<PB N="160" REF="90">
went along with him: where the <HI>Deputy</HI> took one <HI>per Cent.</HI> and the Officers of the Cu&s;toms Five i' the Hundred. So that they took from me Twenty Two Pi&s;tols in Gold, and what they thought fit be&s;ides of the Trifles that were in the Cloak Bag, and among the re&s;t a &s;mall pair of Pi&s;tols, which were all the Arms I had: for which he pay'd me, 'tis true; but not above half the Value. Afterwards he invited me to lye at his Hou&s;e, to which I an&s;wer'd, That &s;ure he did but laugh at me to offer me his Hou&s;e, after he had unju&s;tly made me pay Cu|&s;toms for the Gold and Silver which I had, that never pay'd any Duty's. To which he reply'd, That I was mi&s;-inform'd, and that he had done me no unju&s;tice, for that at <HI>Goni&egrave;</HI> there was nothing exempted from paying the Cu&s;tom; and therefore as for offering me his Hou&s;e it was out of kindne&s;s and favour that he did it. I return'd him Thanks, and told him, That &s;ince he was &s;o forward as to offer me a kindne&s;s, there was one for which I &s;hould for ever be oblig'd to thank him; that he would &s;o far a&s;&s;i&s;t me with a Convenience, that I might get &s;afe to <HI>Akalzik&egrave;;</HI> for it being known over all <HI>Goni&egrave;</HI> that I had a Bag of Gold, I had rea&s;on to fear being Murder'd in the Moun|tains, over which my Road lay, for the remainder of what I carry'd about me. That I was a Stranger, and without Wea|pons to defend my &s;elf, he him&s;elf having tak'n from me all the Arms I had left me; and therefore that he would be pleas'd to lend me &s;ome A&s;&s;i&s;tance. To which he an&s;wer'd, That I needed not to be in &s;uch a Panick Fear, for that, Thanks be to GOD, I was now in the Country of the Faithful (the Epi|thet which the <HI>Turks</HI> a&s;&s;ume to them&s;elves) where I had no rea&s;on to be afraid either of being Robb'd or Murder'd. That he would Warrant me my Life and my Goods; that I might carry my Bag of Gold upon my Head, and Travel without any danger. But as to what remain'd, becau&s;e the way to <HI>Akalzik&egrave;</HI> was very bad, the two fir&s;t Days Journey being to be Travell'd a Foot, through the narrow and Craggy Pa&s;&s;ages of the Mountains, where no Hor&s;e was able to pa&s;s, he would appoint me the next Morning, &s;uch as &s;hould carry my Bag|gage, and conduct me for the fir&s;t Days Journey; where like|wi&s;e the fir&s;t Guides &s;hould be reliev'd by others, till I came to <HI>Akalzik&egrave;.</HI></P>
<P>Having &s;o &s;aid, He offer'd me a Third time to come and &s;pend the Night at his Hou&s;e, and was very importunate with me; and I found afterwards that he did it &s;incerely and for my Good. I wi&s;h to GOD I had perceiv'd his kindne&s;s, but
<PB N="161" REF="90">
I fore&s;aw not the Danger that my Ill Fortune was preparing for me. I was fearful that the Cu&s;tomers De&s;ign in inviting me to his Hou&s;e, was only that he might have an Opportunity to &s;earch my Packs the more exactly; be&s;ides, that I was de|&s;perately afraid, le&s;t it &s;hould come into his Head to &s;earch my &s;elf, having a large Bag of Gold and Pearls in &s;everal parts of my Cloaths.</P>
<P>It was almo&s;t Night when I took my leave of the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e-Officer at his own Hou&s;e; and my Servant had carry'd all my Baggage to the place where the People were gone to lodge that came along with me in the Ve&s;&s;el; which was a pi|tiful Straw-loft, full of Holes in the Walls on every &s;ide, and no le&s;s na&s;ty and &s;tinking withal. There I receiv'd their Com|plements of Condolement, if I may &s;o call 'em; and to &s;ay truth, unle&s;s it were my Servant, who had his &s;hare of the Twenty Two <HI>Pi&s;tols,</HI> all the re&s;t were &s;orry for my lo&s;s; and every one blam'd me for not giving my Bag to &s;ome-body that might have &s;ecur'd it for me. So that I was forc'd to act the part of one that was troubl'd and griev'd for what had hap|pen'd, though in my Heart I was not a little glad I had &s;cap'd &s;o, and all I de&s;ir'd was only to &s;ee the return of Day-light, that I might get rid of that Cut-throat place.</P>
<P>But while I was eating a Mor&s;el of Bisket, in came a Jani|&s;ary to tell my Servant, that the Deputy-Governor would &s;peak with him: for the Commander of the Ca&s;tle being ab|&s;ent, the Deputy &s;upply'd his place. Away went my Servant, and about an Hour after, the &s;ame Jani&s;ary came for me like|wi&s;e. I found the Deputy-Governor &s;itting at the Table with my Servant, both very Drunk: and fir&s;t of all he forc'd me to Eat and Drink whether I would or no: then he told me, That all the Chri&s;tians that belong'd to the Church who pa&s;s'd through <HI>Goni&egrave;,</HI> were oblig'd to give his Ma&s;ter Two Hundred <HI>Ducats,</HI> which makes about a Hundred Pound; that I was one of tho&s;e Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks, and therefore mu&s;t pay &s;o much Money. To which I an&s;wer'd, That I was a Merchant, and that he was mi&s;-inform'd, and that &s;eeing the Officer of the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e had let me go, he had nothing to do to take Cognizance who I was. However, if there were any thing due to the Governor, that I would pay it the next Morning: and that the Night was no time to di&s;cour&s;e the Bu&s;ine&s;s: and having &s;o &s;aid, I was about to ri&s;e and be gone. But I was &s;topp'd by two Jani&s;aries; at what time the Deputy-Governor caus'd me to &s;it down again, and forc'd me to Drink very
<PB N="162" REF="91">
hard; teizing me for two Hours together with a Thou&s;and Impertinencies: and among other things telling me, That all the Goods of the Chri&s;tians belong'd of Right to the Turks, that the <HI>Malte&s;e</HI>'s had tak'n two of his Brothers, and that for a Per&s;on of my Circum&s;tances Twenty <HI>Pi&s;tols</HI> was &s;ufficient. I confe&s;s I found my &s;elf but in a &s;curvy Condition, having to do with People that were Fuddl'd, and my Servant in &s;tead of a&s;&s;i&s;ting me, &s;itting at the Table with my Judge, a Thou|&s;and times more my Ma&s;ter, then I was his, as of right I ought to have been: yet though <HI>I</HI> perceiv'd his Treachery, <HI>I</HI> dur&s;t not &s;peak a word, for fear of wor&s;e that might befal me. <HI>I</HI> took him therefore a&s;ide, and advis'd him not to lo&s;e the Op|portunity of making me more &s;en&s;ible then ever of that Fide|lity wherewith he had &s;erv'd me: that only he could recon|cile the Bu&s;ine&s;s, and that therefore <HI>I</HI> gave him Power to of|fer Twenty Ducats for an Accommodation. My de&s;ign by that counterfeit Confidence, which could do me no harm, was to bridle the Villany of the Traytor, and to prevent him from u&s;ing Extremity. After that, <HI>I</HI> addre&s;s'd my &s;elf to the De|puty-Governor with Intreaties, menacing Hints, and Remon|&s;trances that no body for the future would come near <HI>Goni&egrave;,</HI> when they &s;hould under&s;tand that Pa&s;&s;engers were us'd with &s;o much Violence and Inju&s;tice. To which the Deputy-Go|vernor an&s;wer'd laughing, That <HI>Goni&egrave;</HI> was none of his Lively|hood, that he had but a Year to tarry there, that he car'd not whether any body came thither or no after he was gone; then, let the Ca&s;tle &s;ink if it would; and that he was all for the pre|&s;ent Opportunities, without any regard of the future; and at length it came to that heighth, that the Deputy-Governor find|ing he could not oblige me to &s;atisfie his Demands, &s;ent for my Baggage; which the Traytor of a Servant, my Man, was very officious to fetch. Pre&s;ently the Governor commanded me to take out the Gold; but <HI>I</HI> refus'd to obey him, and told him withal, That <HI>I</HI> would not give him a Farthing, let him do his wor&s;t; for that <HI>I</HI> ow'd him nothing: that <HI>I</HI> could not with|&s;tand his Violence, &s;o that he might take what he pleas'd, but that <HI>I</HI> knew the way to have Satisfaction. Thereupon the Robber &s;ent for Chains and an Iron Collar, which did not a little daunt me, con&s;idering <HI>I</HI> had to do with Souldiers, whom the &s;ight of Gold and the Wine which they had drank to ex|ce&s;s, render'd unlimited in their Actions. At the &s;ame time al&s;o, one of the Souldiers came to me, and whi&s;per'd me in the Ear, <HI>The more ye peel Garlick, the &s;tronger it &s;mells.</HI> As
<PB N="163" REF="91">
much as to &s;ay, The longer you delay to accommodate a wrangling Bu&s;ine&s;s, the more you intreague it. My Servant likewi&s;e pronounc'd Sentence again&s;t me for a Hunderd Ducats. To be &s;hort, I gave 'em the Summ, and four more to the Ja|ni&s;aries, who had perform'd the Office of Bayliffs. The Goods that I had about me, and at my Lodging, the place where I was, and a Hunderd other good Con&s;iderations made me then give way: whereas in another Condition, I &s;hould never have &s;ubmitted to their Threats, nor fear'd their Chains, but have wre&s;ted my &s;elf out of their Clutches Scotfree, or el&s;e with very little lo&s;s. For to &s;hew that it was more then they could an&s;wer, the Deputy Governor, as I was about to tell out the Money, con&s;train'd me to &s;wear upon the Go&s;pel, that I gave it him freely, and that I would not &s;peak a word of it to any per&s;on. Whereupon aro&s;e a fre&s;h di&s;pute, and as hot as the former: for I was unwilling to &s;wear, as being re|&s;olv'd to have made a loud complaint, and de&s;irous withal to &s;ecure my &s;elf for the future by the ob&s;tinacy of my pre&s;ent Re&s;i&s;tance. But this &s;ame Highway-Man of a Governor ab|&s;olutely refus'd to take the Hunderd <HI>Ducats,</HI> but upon that Condition. And therefore there was no other way, but I mu&s;t &s;wear what he would have me in his pre&s;ence, and de&s;ire him to accept the Money.</P>
<P>The next Day, betimes i' the Morning the under Officers of the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e came to my mi&s;erable Lodging, and watch'd me all along till I was ready to depart. They had order, it &s;eems, to make a new Inqui&s;ition into my Saddle, and to &s;earch my Clothes. To that purpo&s;e they call'd my Man, and told him their Errand in the mo&s;t Civil and Courteous Terms they could: and &s;o they fell to &s;earching the Saddle a &s;econd time, I my &s;elf trembling for Fear, all the while it was in their Hands. However they felt nothing that augmen|ted their mi&s;tru&s;t, only the weight amus'd 'em. Which when I perceiv'd to be the only thing that gravell'd 'em, I told 'em, I had made it &s;o heavy, that it might &s;erve me for a Pack Sad|dle upon occa&s;ion; which was the rea&s;on it was &s;o unweildy: and that eva&s;ion it was that &s;av'd me, and &s;atisfi'd their Curio|&s;ity. After that, I found they had a mind to be &s;earching my Cloathes; for they took me a&s;ide one after another, and told me if I had any thing about me, which the Cu&s;tomer had not &s;een, that I &s;hould make 'em a pre&s;ent, and they for their parts would never di&s;cover me. Friends, an&s;wer'd I, never &s;eek for a far-fetch'd excu&s;e to &s;earch me, but if you have a mind,
<PB N="164" REF="92">
do it without any more ado. And with that I open'd my brea&s;t, and &s;hew'd 'em my Pockets: by which Bravado I e&s;cap'd: for the Officers thought I would never have been &s;o bold, had I been afraid of their groaping. Thereupon they forbore to &s;earch me; but carry'd me to the Cu&s;tomer, to whom with feigned Tears in my Eyes, and Counterfeiting a profound trouble of mind, I acknowledg'd how that becau&s;e I did not lodge at his Hou&s;e, I had been de&s;poil'd of part of my Gold. I gave ye good advice, an&s;wer'd he, for I was afraid what would hap|pen; and then he importun'd me to tell him how much they had tak'n, and who had done it, a&s;&s;uring me that <HI>I</HI> &s;hould have Ju&s;tice certainly done me: to which <HI>I</HI> reply'd, that they had threaten'd to kill me if <HI>I</HI> told. Which was very true, be&s;ides that <HI>I</HI> had &s;uch an Impatient de&s;ire to be out of <HI>Goni&egrave;,</HI> that <HI>I</HI> had no mind to be commencing of Suits. Only <HI>I</HI> de|&s;ir'd the Cu&s;tomer to be as good as his word. Which he was, and appointed me two Men to carry my Baggage, and a <HI>Turk</HI> to accompany me to <HI>Akalzik&egrave;.</HI> He al&s;o order'd the two Men to bring a note back under my hand to a&s;&s;ure him that <HI>I</HI> was &s;afely arriv'd at my fir&s;t Journeys end; and gave the <HI>Turk</HI> a Pa&s;&s;port, in the form of an order, to make u&s;e of upon the Road. Which <HI>I</HI> thus Tran&s;lated from the Original.</P>
<Q><HI>Guards of the Highway, Provo&s;ts, Judges, Bayliffs, con|duct from Journeys end to Journeys end, to the Happy Gate of</HI> A&s;lan-Pa&s;ha, John <HI>his Banker.

His Per&s;on and his Goods are a Tru&s;t, which is given in Charge to the Inhabitants of all the places through which he &s;hall pa&s;s; for which they are to be an&s;werable upon their Lives.</HI></Q>
<P>The Cu&s;tomer, when he gave the Note to the <HI>Turk</HI> that was to be my Guide, told me, that he had made me to pa&s;s for the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI>'s Banker, and that <HI>I</HI> &s;hould get a white Turbant for my &s;elf and my Servant, that <HI>I</HI> might be the more re&s;pected. Which <HI>I</HI> did, and &s;et forward about eight of the Clock in the Morning, tran&s;ported with Joy to &s;ee my &s;elf at Liberty out of &s;uch a wicked and Dangerous Place in a Country of Free|dom, where <HI>I</HI> had little or nothing to fear. <HI>I</HI> began then to breath a little, and to recollect and recompo&s;e my Spirits, ha|ving been for five Months in continual Tribulations, Anxieties and Agitations of Mind. Taxations, Shipwrack, Slavery, Wedlock, lo&s;s of Goods, of Liberty and Life, where the
<PB N="165" REF="92">
frightful <HI>Idea</HI>'s that daily hover'd before my Eyes, be&s;ides a thou|&s;and other real Calamities that kept me all that time continually depre&s;s'd under the weight of my Misfortunes. But that Day I recover'd my &s;elf, and with a plea&s;ure unexpre&s;&s;ible, I felt my Heart to expatiate it &s;elf, and rea&s;&s;ume its peaceable Motions. I a&s;cended Mount <HI>Cauca&s;us</HI> with &s;uch a nimblene&s;s of Heels, that my Porters &s;tood in Admiration: &s;o nimble is the Man that has no burthen upon his Heart. And I may truly &s;ay without any Hyperbole's or Metaphors, that I was like one, from who&s;e Shoulders they had remov'd a Mountain, &s;o that me thought I could have flown i' the Air. We Travell'd four Leagues among Rocks; after which I ferry'd over, in a Boat, the River already mention'd that parts the Country of <HI>Guriel</HI> from the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>The 3d I Travell'd five Leagues a Foot, three Men carrying my Luggage: and frequently we pa&s;s'd by the Brinks of &s;uch dreadful Precipices, that &s;car'd me to look down. We did nothing but A&s;cend; &s;o that in Five Leagues we made no more then two Miles of Level way.</P>
<P>The 4th I tarry'd in a Village inhabited by Turks and Chri|&s;tians; where I arriv'd the Day before, in regard the Rain, Snow and Wind would not permit us to &s;et forward any further.</P>
<P>I Travell'd the Fifth and Sixth, Eleven Leagues. 'Tis true, I had Hor&s;es, but I dare be bold to &s;ay, I did not ride above Three Leagues of all that way; for I was forc'd to alight every foot: the way being &s;o rugged and &s;teep, that the Hor&s;es could hard|ly keep their Feet.</P>
<P>The Seventh and Eighth, I travell'd 16 Leagues; up Hill and down Hill for the Four fir&s;t I eagues; the next Eight were all a Smooth Road, but full of Turnings and Windings: and then we got to the Top of Mount <HI>Cauca&s;us:</HI> after which we Travell'd Four Leagues continually upon the De&s;cent. Half way down the Hill were to be &s;een the Spires and Tops of the Ruins of &s;everal Ca&s;tles and Churches; of which as the People &s;aid, there had been a con&s;iderable number, till de&s;troy'd by the <HI>Turks.</HI> The bottom of the Hill leads ye into a fair Valley Three Miles broad, Rich and Fertile, and full of Villages: being water'd by the River <HI>Kur,</HI> that runs through the middle of it.</P>
<P>'Tis known that <HI>A&s;ia</HI> is divided by a Chain of Mountains that run along from one end to the other, of which the highe&s;t parts were call'd <HI>Taurus, Imaus</HI> and <HI>Cauca&s;us.</HI> The fir&s;t is that part which advances it &s;elf to the farthe&s;t part of <HI>A&s;ia;</HI> and this Chain or Ridg is generally call'd <HI>Taurus.</HI> I &s;ay generally, becau&s;e that every part derives a particular Name from the Nation, to
<PB N="166" REF="93">
which it adjoyns. The la&s;t part, which is the neare&s;t to <HI>Europe,</HI> lies between the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI> and the <HI>Ca&s;pian Sea,</HI> between <HI>Mu&s;|covy</HI> and <HI>Turkey.</HI> But the&s;e three Names are confu&s;edly made u&s;e of by many Authors, among the re&s;t, <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Q. Curtius,</HI> who place <HI>Cauca&s;us</HI> in <HI>India.</HI> However <HI>Strabo,</HI> who reports this in his Geography, affirms that <HI>Q. Curtius</HI> did it to magnifie the wonders of <HI>Alexander</HI>'s Hi&s;tory, in regard that <HI>Cauca&s;us</HI> being the highe&s;t part of all Mount <HI>Taurus,</HI> and that which the Fables of the Poets have render'd mo&s;t Famous, the Renown of his Hero became the greater, whom he makes to force his way over it with his Victorious Sword. And indeed I &s;hould have thought it had been a fault in Geography, which <HI>Q. Curtius</HI> committed igno|rantly, as when he brings <HI>Ganges</HI> from the South, and takes <HI>Jaxartes</HI> for the River <HI>Tanais.</HI> I &s;ay I &s;hould take it for an Error, if I did not find him in his Sixth Book, putting the Mountain <HI>Cauca&s;us</HI> between <HI>Hircania</HI> and the River <HI>Pha&s;is.</HI></P>
<P>But to return to the De&s;cription of Mount <HI>Cauca&s;us,</HI> it is the highe&s;t Mountain, and mo&s;t difficult to pa&s;s over that ever I be|held. For it is full of Rocks and di&s;mal Precipices, through which there have been great endeavours us'd to make a hollow way. At the time when I pa&s;s'd it, it was all cover'd with Snow, in many places above Ten Foot deep: &s;o that my Guides oft-times were forc'd to make way with their &s;hovels: for they had upon their Feet a &s;ort of Sandals proper to walk upon the Snow, which I never &s;aw but in that Country, the bottom of it being made in the &s;hape, and about the length of a Racket without a handle, but not &s;o broad, the Network is al&s;o not &s;o tight, and the Wood is altogether circular. Which prevents their &s;inking in|to the Snow, for that it bears up the weight of the body, and keeps the Foot from &s;inking above a Fingers Depth. They will al&s;o run with the&s;e &s;ort of Sandals very fa&s;t, hardly leaving any print of their Feet, or any &s;ign which way they have gone, for that the Sandal has neither Toes nor Heels. The Top of Mount <HI>Cauca&s;us</HI> is perpetually cover'd with Snow, and for eight Leagues in the Road we travell'd in cro&s;&s;ing it, altogether uninhabi|ted. So that I was forc'd to &s;pend the whole Night in the Snow. Only I caus'd the Fellows to cut me down &s;ome Firr-Trees upon which <HI>I</HI> lay, after <HI>I</HI> had order'd 'em to make a good Fire. When <HI>I</HI> came to the Top of the Mountain, the People that were my Guides, made long Prayers to their Images, for their favor to keep the Wind from Ri&s;ing. For had the Wind been high, we had without doubt been all Buried in the Snow; for being loo&s;e and &s;mall as du&s;t, the Wind ea&s;ily carries it away, and
<PB N="167" REF="93">
fills the Air with it; but GOD be thanked there was no Wind. However, the Hor&s;es would &s;ink &s;o deep in many places, that I thought they would never get out: for my part <HI>I</HI> travell'd for the mo&s;t part afoot, and &s;ecure enough: nor do <HI>I</HI> believe <HI>I</HI> rode above eight Leagues in cro&s;&s;ing over this hideous Mountain, which is &s;ix and thirty Leagues. <HI>I</HI> thought for the two la&s;t days, that <HI>I</HI> had been in the Clouds, not being able to &s;ee twenty Paces before me: be&s;ides that the Firr-Trees that grow very thick all over the Mountain prevent any pro&s;pect at a di&s;tance: only as <HI>I</HI> went down Hill, the Clouds roll'd under my Feet, as far as <HI>I</HI> could &s;ee, &s;o that <HI>I</HI> could not but think my &s;elf i' the Air, though <HI>I</HI> felt at the &s;ame time that <HI>I</HI> trod upon the Ground.</P>
<P>Mount <HI>Cauca&s;us</HI> till ye come to the very top is extreamly fertil in Honey, Wheat, and Gom, (of which I have &s;pok'n in the De&s;cri|ption of <HI>Mingrelia)</HI> in Wine, in Fruits, in Pigs, and large Cattel. The Vines grow there about the Trees, and run up &s;o high, that many times they are not able to climb up to gather the Grapes. Be&s;ides, it was Vintage-time when I cro&s;s'd the Mountain; and I found the Grape, the new and the old Wine, to be extreamly good, and &s;o cheap withal in &s;ome parts, that you might buy 300 weight for a Crown: for the Country People not having Vent for it, left the Grapes to hang &amp; rot upon the Branches, as not worth the gathering.</P>
<P>The Country People dwell in Wooden Huts: of which every Family has four or five; in the bigge&s;t of which they make a Fire, and &s;it round about it. The Women grind the Corn, as they have occa&s;ion for Bread; which they bake in round Stones a Foot or there|abouts in Diameter, and &s;ome two or three Fingers in depth. The&s;e Stones they make very hot, put in the Dough, and then cover it with hot A&s;hes, and live Coals over that: and in &s;ome places they bake it in the Embers only. To which purpo&s;e they &s;weep the Hearth very clean, lay the Dough upon it, and then cover it with A&s;hes and live Coals as before. Neverthele&s;s the Cru&s;t is very white, and the Bread very good. They keep their Wine as they do in <HI>Mingrelia.</HI> I lodg'd every Night at &s;ome Countryman's Hou&s;e or other, of whom <HI>I</HI> hir'd either Hor&s;es or Porters. The <HI>Turk</HI> al&s;o, who was recommend|ed to me, &s;erv'd me very dextrou&s;ly, and as well as the place would afford. They gave us Hens, Eggs, Pul&s;e, Wine, Bread, and overcloy'd us with Fruit. For every Neighbouring Hou&s;e brought us a great Pitcher of Wine, a Pannier of Fruit, and a Basket of Bread for their &s;hare of what we wanted. For which we never ask'd them what was to pay, nor would my Guide permit me to give 'em any Gratuity.</P>
<P>I fell on like a Wolf, not being able to &s;atisfie my Hunger in le&s;s then two or three hours. For it is not to be imagin'd what an empty
<PB N="168" REF="94">
Stomach <HI>I</HI> had all the while that <HI>I</HI> was in <HI>Mingrelia</HI> for three months together, during all which time I could get no Bread, be&s;ides that I was all the while under the &s;courge of Hunger, and in continual dread of &s;ome Mi&s;chief or other. But now, thanks be to GOD, I liv'd in &s;ecurity and plenty, and from a dete&s;table Country where I could not get Vittles for Money, <HI>I</HI> was got into another Region where they gave me Meat and Drink for nothing: Nor is it po&s;|&s;ible for any Man, that has not undergone tho&s;e Extremities, to conceive the plea&s;ure of &s;o happy a Change.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of the&s;e Mountains are for the mo&s;t part Chri|&s;tians after the <HI>Georgian</HI> Ceremonies. They are very fre&s;h Com|plexion'd, and I have &s;een very hand&s;om Women among 'em. Be|&s;ides, they are infinitely better di&s;po&s;ition'd then the <HI>Mingrelians,</HI> and the other People of Mount <HI>Cauca&s;us,</HI> that are not under the Dominion of the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>The ninth <HI>I</HI> travell'd five Leagues through a Plain, of which <HI>I</HI> have already &s;pok'n; the Soyl of which is very proper for Tillage: and upon the Hills that &s;urround it great Numbers of Cattel graze. In the Evening <HI>I</HI> arriv'd at <HI>Akalzik&egrave;.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Akalzik&egrave;</HI> is a Fortre&s;s built upon Mount <HI>Cauca&s;us,</HI> &s;eated in a hollow place, among twenty Hillocks or thereabouts, from whence the Ca&s;tle might be ea&s;ily batter'd on every &s;ide, though fortifi'd with double Walls, and flanqu'd with Towers, both built with Battlements after the Ancient Manner. Adjoyning to this Fortre&s;s, which is defended with only a few great Guns, &s;tand upon the Neighbouring Hillocks aforemention'd a large Town, con&s;i&s;ting of about 400 Hou&s;es all new, and which &s;eem to have been but lately built: &s;o that there is nothing of Antiquity to be &s;een, but two <HI>Armenian</HI> Churches. The Town is Peopl'd with <HI>Turks, Armenians, Georgians, Greeks</HI> and <HI>Jews;</HI> the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> having their Churches, and the <HI>Jews</HI> a Synagogue. There is al&s;o in it an Inn newly built of Wood, as are all the re&s;t of the Hou&s;es in that place. The Ri|ver <HI>Kur</HI> runs along by it, which derives it Head from the Moun|tain <HI>Cauca&s;us,</HI> and was call'd anciently <HI>Cyrus,</HI> and by &s;ome <HI>Corus. Strabo</HI> places the Head of it in <HI>Armenia, Ptolomy</HI> in <HI>Colchis; Pliny</HI> will have it &s;pring from the Mountains of <HI>Tartary,</HI> which are be|yond <HI>Colchis,</HI> which he calls <HI>Coraxicie,</HI> becau&s;e of the River <HI>Corax</HI> that &s;prings from thence, and di&s;charges it &s;elf into the <HI>Black-Sea.</HI> Which Opinions &s;eeming &s;o various may neverthele&s;s be true, and come all to one and the &s;ame thing. For that <HI>Armenia</HI> has formerly included <HI>Colchis;</HI> and becau&s;e <HI>Colchis</HI> formerly was a great King|dom, as I have already ob&s;erv'd. The <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of <HI>Akalzik&egrave;</HI> lodges in the Fortre&s;s, and the Principal Officers and Souldiers quarter in the adjacent Villages.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="94">
This Fortre&s;s was built by the <HI>Georgians,</HI> from whom the <HI>Turks</HI> took it toward the end of the la&s;t Age.</P>
<P>The 13th about Two a Clock in the Morning I parted from <HI>Akalzik&egrave;,</HI> travailing directly Ea&s;tward. At the end of three Leagues the Plain of <HI>Akalzik&egrave;</HI> &s;treightens, to the breadth of half a League, having the Mountains on both &s;ides. In that part &s;tands a Ca&s;tle built by the <HI>Turks</HI> upon a Rock, on the right &s;ide of the River <HI>Kur.</HI> This Rock below is encom|pa&s;s'd with a double Wall; and round about it lies a little Village like <HI>Akalzik&egrave;,</HI> which takes up all the Ground between the Fortre&s;s and the oppo&s;ite Mountain; and is call'd <HI>Usker;</HI> having a Gari&s;on and a Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e under the Command of a <HI>Sanziac.</HI> I was in great fear of being there &s;topp'd and ex|amin'd, but Thanks be to GOD, they let me pa&s;s, without &s;aying a word to me. For my Guide was born at <HI>Gory</HI> a City of <HI>Georgia.</HI> So that upon his An&s;wer, to the Captain of the Guard, who ask'd him, What Countryman he was? That he was a <HI>Georgian</HI> of <HI>Gory,</HI> the Captain let him pa&s;s with all his Train without any farther Examination. The rea&s;on is, for that the <HI>Kaan</HI> of <HI>Georgia</HI> and the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of <HI>Akalzik&egrave;</HI> hold a very good Corre&s;pondence together, which makes the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;o kind to the <HI>Georgians.</HI> Two Leagues beyond <HI>&V;sker</HI> we cro&s;s'd a Mountain, which parts on this &s;ide <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> from <HI>Turkey.</HI> We travell'd along the Brow of this Mountain af|ter we had cro&s;s'd it. There are &s;everal Villages &s;eated on the top of it: the River <HI>Kur</HI> running below through the Vale, where in &s;everal parts are to be &s;een the Ruines of Ca&s;tles, Fortre&s;&s;es and Churches; the Foot&s;teps of the Grandeur of the <HI>Georgians,</HI> and of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Conque&s;ts. After we had travell'd ten Leagues, till it was Night, we &s;topp'd at a little Village.</P>
<P>The 14th we travell'd not above four Leagues, the way being very rugged in tho&s;e Mountains, where you meet with &s;everal narrow Paths and clo&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages, where you cannot force your way; together with the Ruines of many Fortre&s;&s;es. We &s;topp'd in the Plain of <HI>Surham,</HI> at a great Town near the Fortre&s;s, which is call'd by the &s;ame Name. It is a very love|ly Plain, full of Cop&s;es, Villages, Hillocks, Hou&s;es of Plea|&s;ure, and little Ca&s;tles belonging to the <HI>Georgian</HI> Lords. The Country is all over well Till'd; and in a word, it is a very delightful Spot of Ground.</P>
<P>The 15th I travell'd ten Leagues, nine through the Plain, and the other at the pa&s;&s;age of a Mountain &s;omewhat high,
<PB N="170" REF="95">
which parts it from <HI>Gory.</HI> I &s;aw nothing on every &s;ide but fair Villages, lovely Fields well Manur'd, and every where the Ground very fertile We left upon the right Hand before we a&s;cended the Mountain, a great City lying almo&s;t all in Ruines, as not containing above Five Hunderd Hou&s;es inha|bited, whereas formerly, by report it contain'd above Twelve Thou&s;and. However, there belongs to it a Bi&s;hop and a great Church, built before the <HI>Georgians</HI> were reduc'd under Subjection. Night overtook me upon the De&s;cent of the Mountain, before I arriv'd at <HI>Gory.</HI> I went directly to the Re&s;idence of the <HI>Italian Capuchins,</HI> Mi&s;&s;ionaries of the Con|gregation <HI>de Propaganda Fide;</HI> to whom I had Letters of Re|commendation. Not above three Years ago they had a Dwel|ling at <HI>Cotatis,</HI> and then they thought al&s;o to have &s;pread them|&s;elves into <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> and to have &s;ettl'd there. But the Con|tinual Wars in that Country, and the Robberies perpetually there committed, the King either not being able, or not ca|ring to prevent 'em, con&s;train'd 'em to retire back into <HI>Geor|gia.</HI> So that the Opportunity of meeting with 'em was very acceptable to me; in regard they were able to give me what Advice and A&s;&s;i&s;tance I &s;tood in need of. For that rea&s;on I pre&s;ently made my &s;elf known to 'em; and told 'em, That the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> had &s;ent me into <HI>France</HI> to do him parti|cular Services; that I had his Orders, and a Command di|rected to all the Governors of the Empire to give me Re&s;pect, and to &s;erve me upon all Occa&s;ions, and with all Convenien|cies I &s;hould &s;tand in need of. Afterwards I acquainted 'em, That having cho&s;en to return into <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> by the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI> and &s;o through <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> I had been &s;urpriz'd by the Wars in that Country, and had undergone a Thou&s;and Hard&s;hips &s;o that not finding any way &s;ecurely to bring along with me tho&s;e things which I had brought for the King, I had left 'em in the Cu&s;tody of my Comrade, and was come into <HI>Georgia</HI> to de&s;ire A&s;&s;i&s;tance; and therefore I mo&s;t affectionately be&s;ought 'em to give me the be&s;t Advice they could, and to take that Compa&s;&s;ion of my Hard&s;hips and Troubles, to which Charity and other Con&s;iderations oblig'd 'em.</P>
<P>Upon which the Good Fathers were concern'd for my Mi&s;|fortunes, the hazards I had run, and for the Per&s;on I had left in <HI>Mingrelia.</HI> And they a&s;&s;ur'd me to do for me what ever lay in their Power &s;o &s;oon as they &s;hould have permi&s;&s;ion from their General; for that they had no Power to act without fir&s;t con&s;ulting him, and without his Approbation. That he was
<PB N="171" REF="95">
at <HI>Trifflis,</HI> the capital City of <HI>Georgia,</HI> two &s;mall days journey di&s;tant, and that my be&s;t way would be to go and waite upon him. And indeed they gave me &s;o many rea&s;ons to con&s;train me to go; that I re&s;olv'd it without any more to do, and to that purpo&s;e hir'd Hor&s;es forthwith. The Superiour al&s;o or|der'd a Lay-Brother, who&s;e Name was <HI>Angelo</HI> of <HI>Viterbo,</HI> to get him&s;elf ready to bear me Company.</P>
<P>This Lay-Brother was a Per&s;on of Hone&s;ty and Integrity, and both an able Phy&s;itian and Surgeon. His Dexterity and the good luck he had in <HI>Georgia</HI> and <HI>Imiretta,</HI> to cure &s;everal Di&s;ea&s;es and Wounds which were thought to be incurable, had rais'd him to a high Value and E&s;teem over all the Coun|try. He under&s;tood the Language very well of all tho&s;e parts, as having travell'd 'em from one end to the other; be|&s;ides that he was a Per&s;on of Courage, Patience, Humility and &s;ound Judgment. He was the mo&s;t plea&s;ant and facetious Company in the World, and after I had te&s;tifi'd to him, that his Society would be of great advantage to me, and a great comfort to me in my return to <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> he told me, that I had no more to do then to reque&s;t the Superiors leave, and he would willingly go along with me.</P>
<P>The 16th we departed from <HI>Gory</HI> with this hone&s;t Father, and rode Seven Leagues for the mo&s;t part upon the Banks of the River <HI>Kurr.</HI> The road was very delightful, through fer|tile Plains, where there was a great number of Villages. Among the re&s;t there is one City call'd <HI>Cali-Cala</HI> about Four Leagues from <HI>Gory;</HI> that lies almo&s;t in Ruins, through the mid&s;t of which we are oblig'd to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>The 17th I travell'd &s;omewhat more then Six Leagues in a level Road, but &s;omewhat Stony in &s;ome parts. By that time we got half way, we came right again&s;t the Metropolitan Church of <HI>Georgia.</HI> &s;eated upon the Banks of <HI>Kur.</HI> One half of which lies in Ruines, the other &s;eems to be entire, and a very fair &s;tructure. They tell us, that there is within it one part of the Crown of Thorns, a piece of the Tunick, and a piece of the Prophet <HI>Elia</HI>'s Garment. I did not &s;ee the Re|liques my &s;elf, but the <HI>Capuchins</HI> a&s;&s;ur'd me, they had &s;een 'em &s;everal times. Toward the Evening I arriv'd at <HI>Trifflis,</HI> for the Snow that fell very thick all the Day, hinderd me from getting thither &s;ooner: at what time the Lay-Brother who ac|company'd me, conducted me to the Hou&s;e where the <HI>Capu|chins</HI> lay. I had not time to lo&s;e, &s;o that as &s;oon as I came, I acquainted the Superiour with the rea&s;on of my coming;
<PB N="172" REF="96">
which my Letters of Recommendation gave him likewi&s;e to under&s;tand. And indeed my main bu&s;ine&s;s was to let 'em know the danger in which my goods were, that I had left in <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> and of what importance it was for me to run all ha|zards to get 'em &s;afe from thence. I told the Superiour that there were in my opinion two &s;everal ways to accompli&s;h my de&s;ign, both &s;afe in &s;ome re&s;pects, but hazardous in others. The fir&s;t was to make my Addre&s;&s;es to the Prince of <HI>Georgia,</HI> to &s;hew him the Orders of the King his Ma&s;ter, and to de&s;ire his A&s;&s;i&s;tance to fetch from <HI>Mingrelia</HI> what I had got for his Maje&s;ties U&s;e. The Second was to go privately into the Country, without di&s;covering my &s;elf, or telling any per&s;on what I went about. Nor would I di&s;cover to the Superiour my Approbation of the Second way for fear of preventing his Judgment. He de&s;ir'd &s;ome time to con&s;ider before he gave me his advice, and reque&s;ted me withal to acquaint the re&s;t of the Fryers with what I had imparted to him, for that they mo&s;t part of them having been in <HI>Mingrelia</HI> and <HI>Imiretta,</HI> might give farther light as to the management of my Affairs, and pro|mis'd me he would enjoyn 'em Secrecy under forfeiture of the Holy Obedience. Thereupon I &s;atisfi'd the Superiour, and gave the &s;ame Relation to the re&s;t of the Monks as I had done to him, conjuring 'em to give me their be&s;t advice, and all the A&s;&s;i&s;tance they could in the Misfortune that was befall'n me.</P>
<P>The 18th in the afternoon the Superiour carry'd me into his Chamber, together with the re&s;t of the Monks, where he lay'd before me all the Reflections that he had made upon my bu&s;ine&s;s, and all the thoughts that had come into his Head con|cerning it: and the Monks al&s;o did the &s;ame thing. They al|mo&s;t all agreed to try the private way, without making my &s;elf known, which was, in a word, to go &s;ecretly into <HI>Mingre|lia.</HI> They told me that if I imparted my Bu&s;ine&s;s to the Prince of <HI>Georgia,</HI> he would certainly give me all nece&s;&s;ary A&s;&s;i&s;tance, that he would &s;end People along with me that would bring away all my goods, in regard he was very much fear'd and re&s;pected both in that Country and <HI>Imiretta.</HI> But this would be to make a great Noi&s;e, which perhaps might prove my Ruin, if they &s;hould wait for me to Murder me in my return and rob me of all I had; for that the Country through which I was to pa&s;s, was all a Country of Murderers and Robbers the mo&s;t re&s;olute in the World. Be&s;ides that the <HI>Georgians</HI> were very perfidious and wicked: and therefore I had great rea&s;on to look well to my &s;elf; in regard it was not many years &s;ince
<PB N="173" REF="96">
that a Patriarch of <HI>Mo&s;covy,</HI> travelling through <HI>Georgia,</HI> had been &s;trip'd of all; in which Fact it was thought the Prince of <HI>Georgia</HI> had a Hand, to make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of the Wealth which he carry'd along with him. Be&s;ides that, I was al&s;o to con&s;ider, that though the Prince of <HI>Georgia</HI> &s;hould ab&s;olutely obey the Kings Commands, and &s;uppo&s;ing he &s;hould be real and &s;incere, yet he would expect large Pre&s;ents; and that it would be impo&s;&s;ible to &s;atisfie him and his Retinue, who were wonderful hungry and &s;harp for Per&s;ons of their Condition.</P>
<P>I was overjoy'd to find that the <HI>Capuchins</HI> concurr'd &s;o ex|actly with my Judgment, and thought the very &s;ame Thoughts which I did: &s;o that it was at la&s;t concluded that I &s;hould de|part privately with my Companion Fryer <HI>Angelo.</HI> That I &s;hould pretend to be a <HI>Theatin,</HI> who had been &s;ent by tho&s;e of <HI>Colchis,</HI> who were by War reduc'd to utmo&s;t Mi&s;ery, to beg relief from the <HI>Capuchins;</HI> who had order'd along with me one of their Society to find 'em out, and bring 'em away. Which being thus determin'd, I provided for my Journey; and to that purpo&s;e I took out all the Jewels, which I had hid in my Saddle, and my Pillow, and having put 'em into a little Trunk that I carry'd about me, I deliver'd 'em to the Cu&s;tody of the Superiour. And now we were at a great lo&s;s for Hor|&s;es, for that no body would venture their Goods into <HI>Mingre|lia;</HI> but at length by the power of Money we obtain'd two Guides and their Hor&s;es; giving &s;ecurity both for the Hor&s;es and the Furniture.</P>
<P>The 20th I &s;et forward with Fryer <HI>Angelo</HI> and a <HI>Georgian,</HI> who was a Servant of the <HI>Capuchins,</HI> a Native of <HI>Cotatis,</HI> and who had a Thou&s;and times travell'd <HI>Colchis</HI> and the parts there|about, and whom the Superiour &s;ent along with me, to &s;erve me upon all Occa&s;ions where I &s;hould have need of a Tru&s;ty Per&s;on. And thus we were five Men, with four Hor&s;es. Upon two of which rode Fryer <HI>Angelo</HI> and my &s;elf; the other two carry'd our Provi&s;ions: and all along we gave it out that we were &s;ent to the <HI>Theatins</HI> of <HI>Mingrelia.</HI> As for my Lacquey, I had di&s;mi&s;s'd him, before I went to <HI>Tefflis.</HI> This Ra&s;cal had plaid me a Thou&s;and Rogui&s;h Tricks, and had once endea|vour'd to have ruin'd me; and I have already related how he &s;erv'd me at <HI>Gonia.</HI> The <HI>Capuchins</HI> advis'd me to have him &s;ent to Pri&s;on till my return, and then to pro&s;ecute him: But the deep &s;en&s;e I had of GOD's Favour towards me, enclin'd me to pardon him altogether. I fear'd to provoke the Wrath of Heaven, &s;hould I at a time that Heaven was &s;o merciful to
<PB N="174" REF="97">
me, have pre&s;um'd to &s;eek the Extremities of Ju&s;tice and Ri|gour. And therefore I paid the wicked Ra&s;cal for all the time that he had &s;erv'd me, and let him go, after I had fully di&s;cover'd all the Rogueries and Mi&s;chievous Qualities that I knew of him, and had given him good Advice to mend his Manners. But my Kindne&s;s wrought nothing upon him: the Fellow was mad that I had di&s;mi&s;s'd him, and gave me tho&s;e Te&s;timonies of his Di&s;content, that were enough to forewarn me of &s;ome fatal Con&s;equence of his Revenge. So that I could have found i' my Heart to have laid him in Irons: and had I &s;aid the lea&s;t word, the <HI>Capuchins</HI> would have done it in the Twinkling of an Eye, as being in great Credit at <HI>Tefflis.</HI> But I forbore, prevented by that Fate which Governs all Things. I was wholly inclin'd to pity; for I expected and de&s;ir'd it too much my &s;elf, not to &s;hew it to another: and it was no more then what &s;eem'd acceptable to GOD. And we &s;hall &s;ee hereafter how he &s;hew'd him&s;elf pleas'd with what I had done; by delivering me from a Dangerous Snare which the Traytor had laid for me.</P>
<P>I return'd to <HI>Gory</HI> the 21&s;t.</P>
<P>The 22d we parted thence, and lay &s;ix Leagues from <HI>Gory,</HI> at a Village upon the Road to <HI>Akalzik&egrave;,</HI> which I had Rid in my fir&s;t Travels in tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P>The 23d we departed by break of Day, and pre&s;ently left the Road of <HI>Akalzik&egrave;</HI> upon the Left-hand. At Noon we ar|riv'd at a &s;mall Village call'd <HI>Aly;</HI> lying nine Leagues from <HI>Gory,</HI> and &s;eated among the Mountains. Two Leagues be|yond that, we pa&s;s'd a Streight, which is fenc'd with a great Gate of Carpenters Work, and &s;eparates <HI>Georgia</HI> from the Kingdom of <HI>Imiretta;</HI> from whence we rode one League far|ther, and &s;topp'd at a little Village.</P>
<P>The 24th we travell'd &s;even Leagues in the Mountains; which were full of Snow that fell in great Flakes: the Moun|tains them&s;elves, which are a part of Mount <HI>Cauca&s;us,</HI> being cover'd with very high Trees. There we thought we &s;hould have lo&s;t our &s;elves: for the Snow being very deep, cover'd all the Paths and Tracks, that we could not &s;ee our way: but at length we came to a Village call'd <HI>Colbaure,</HI> where we lay. This Village con&s;i&s;ts of about Two Hunderd Hou&s;es, all in a direct line, and &s;o far di&s;tant one from another, that it is above three Miles from the fir&s;t to the la&s;t.</P>
<P>The 25th we travell'd not above nine Miles, the bad Wea|ther, the Snow, Cold, and Ob&s;curity of the Air in tho&s;e high
<PB N="175" REF="97">
Mountains hindring us from going any farther: however, at la&s;t we lodg'd at a Village containing about thirty Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>The 26th, the Air clear'd up, it had done Snowing, nor was it &s;o bitter Cold: &s;o that we travell'd Eighteen Miles among the Mountains cover'd with thick Woods. Yet the Road was indifferent, in regard the A&s;cents and De&s;cents were not very &s;teep. And we lay at a &s;mall Village by the &s;ide of a great River.</P>
<P>The 27th we Ferry'd over the River, and travell'd Three Leagues in a Country like that which we had pa&s;s'd the Days before. And de&s;cending the Mountain we came into a large and fair plain extending as far as we could &s;ee; and lodg'd at a Village call'd <HI>Se&s;ano.</HI> This Valley is almo&s;t a League broad from one end to the other; and it is very fertile and very plea|&s;ant, as being water'd with &s;everal Streams; extending it &s;elf as far as <HI>Mingrelia;</HI> and being the mo&s;t plea&s;ant part of all <HI>Imi|retta.</HI> The Mountains with which it is &s;urrounded are cover'd with Wood and Villages: for the greate&s;t part of the Moun|tains are till'd; and full of Vineyards. In this Valley we found the Air to be as warm as if it had been Spring, and very little Snow.</P>
<P><HI>Se&s;ano</HI> lay near to a Ca&s;tle belonging to an Ancient Lady, who was Aunt to the King of <HI>Imiretta,</HI> who lay &s;ick at the time that we arriv'd there. Who hearing that there was a <HI>Capuchin</HI> come to the Village, &s;ent for him, to di&s;cour&s;e with him. For in that Country, they look upon all the Mi&s;&s;iona|ries to be Phy&s;icians. Nor was the Fryer unwilling to vi&s;it her, hoping to procure &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance from her in our de&s;ign. But two Hours after he had left me, I was &s;urpriz'd to be overtaken by another <HI>Capuchin</HI> with a Hor&s;e and a Guide. The cau&s;e of who&s;e following me &s;o clo&s;e was to give me Intelligence, that the Lacquey which I had di&s;mi&s;s'd was come from <HI>Tefflis</HI> to <HI>Gory,</HI> where he had di&s;cover'd all that he knew of my bu&s;i|ne&s;s, &s;wearing to ruin me, and that he was gone, no body knew which way: Which &s;urpriz'd me very much. For I mi&s;tru&s;ted &s;ome &s;uch thing. I de&s;ir'd the <HI>Capuchin</HI> therefore to tarry with me, gave him a Thou&s;and Thanks, and highly ap|plauded the great Zeal and Affection of the Society toward me, which they had te&s;tifi'd by &s;uch an evident and Gene|rous Demon&s;tration: and indeed they could not have given me more apparent tok'ns of their kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>The 20th we travell'd Five Leagues in the Plain already mention'd; which is very full of Villages and Woods, and
<PB N="176" REF="98">
the &s;oyl &s;o extreamly fat, that our Hor&s;es had much a do to poach along. After we had travell'd Six Miles, we left the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Scander</HI> upon the right Hand. The People of the Country call it <HI>Scanda,</HI> and affirm that <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great built it. For the Ea&s;tern People call that Victorious Prince by the Name of <HI>Scander.</HI> They tell ye farther that he built Se|venteen Places more which he call'd by the &s;ame Name. And perhaps this might be one of the Seventeen, and the &s;ame which is mention'd by <HI>Q. Curtius</HI> in his Seventh Book. Which I am inclin'd to believe by its Situation, for it is &s;eated at the foot of a Mountain. It is now of no force; con&s;i&s;ting only of two &s;quare Towers, without any Wall, with &s;ome Lodgings round about; nor does it's Antiquity &s;eem to exceed about 300 Years.</P>
<P>About a League from <HI>Scander</HI> we pa&s;s'd through <HI>Chicaris,</HI> a Village con&s;i&s;ting of about Fifty Hou&s;es. It goes for a City in <HI>Imiretta,</HI> though it have neither Walls, nor any thing more remarkable then any other Villages: we put in, and lay at a place, a League from thence.</P>
<P>The 29th and 30th we &s;tay'd there. For our Guides would go no farther. The news of the Wars of which all the Tra|vellers upon the Road gave us Intelligence, melted their Hearts i' their Bellies. They cry'd out we &s;hould carry 'em to certain Death or Slavery, and indeed they gave us a great deal of trouble. Which I endur'd with as much Patience, and exhorted my two <HI>Capuchins</HI> to the &s;ame. I lay'd before 'em, that I had let 'em under&s;tand at my departure from <HI>Tefflis,</HI> that it was impo&s;&s;ible to accompli&s;h what I had undertaken without a great deal of Courage and Patience, to vanqui&s;h all the ob&s;tacles which we &s;hould infallibly meet with. That we were to manage our People gently and mildly, and to win 'em by fair means and large promi&s;es. That when we had once got 'em into <HI>Mingrelia</HI> and that they could not go back, the care of their own &s;afety would make 'em do what we pleas'd. Thereupon we call'd the two Guides, and the <HI>Georgian</HI> which the Superiour had recommended to me, and told 'em that there was no danger, that we had good Intelligence and In&s;tructions, that we had Lives and Goods to pre&s;erve as well as they; and that we had given 'em &s;ecurity as well for their Lives as their Per&s;ons. To which one in behalf of the re&s;t made an&s;wer, that we &s;hould give 'em a Writing, wherein we &s;hould en|gage to redeem 'em, if they were tak'n Slaves in that Journy, or el&s;e to give Six&s;core Crowns to their Wives, if they &s;hould
<PB N="177" REF="98">
die. To which I willingly agreed, and made 'em large promi&s;es be&s;ides. Which put 'em into a good humour to go on.</P>
<P>The 31&s;t we &s;et forward; though it were bad Weather, and very bad Way. Neverthele&s;s we cro&s;s'd three very broad and rapid Rivers, and at length arriv'd at <HI>Cotatis.</HI> Where we lay at the Hou&s;e of Bi&s;hop <HI>Janarell;</HI> who was not at home, however we were well entertain'd. For his Officers were ac|quainted with Fryer <HI>Angelo,</HI> and knew that their Ma&s;ter had a great kindne&s;s for him.</P>
<P><HI>Cotatis</HI> is a Town built at the Foot of a Hill, by the &s;ide of the River <HI>Pha&s;is,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of about 200 Hou&s;es. Tho&s;e of the Grandees, and the King's Palace &s;tand at a di&s;tance round about. The Town has neither Fortifications nor Walls, &s;aving where it is enclos'd by the River and the Mountain. On the other &s;ide of the River over again&s;t the Town, upon the top of a Hill higher then that under which the Town is built, &s;tands the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Cotatis,</HI> of which I have &s;pok'n in my Relations of the la&s;t Revolutions in <HI>Imiretta.</HI> I did not go into it, but I &s;aw it plainly from the oppo&s;ite Hill. It has &s;everal Towers, a Dungeon, and a double Wall that appears very high and &s;trong.</P>
<P>When I came to <HI>Cotatis,</HI> I enquir'd what News. And the true&s;t that I met with, and which every one a&s;&s;ur'd us, was, That the new Prince of <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Guriel</HI> were retir'd, finding that the <HI>Turks</HI> would keep the Field no longer; that the greate&s;t part of the Gentry, who had giv'n their Oaths, had for&s;ak'n 'em, and that the <HI>Vizier</HI> of <HI>Dadian</HI> was preparing to fall down from the Mountains with an Army. That as &s;oon as the <HI>Vizier</HI> had intelligence of the Retreat of the two Princes and the <HI>Turks,</HI> he had &s;ent 800 Men to <HI>Da|dian,</HI> had writ to him to quit the Fortre&s;s, and to rai&s;e what Men he could, that he had proclaim'd a free Pardon to all tho&s;e that would come and joyn with him; la&s;tly, that he was come to <HI>Cotatis,</HI> where the King of <HI>Imiretta</HI> had joyn'd him, with the Nobility of his Country; and that they were march'd to|gether in a Body, with a re&s;olution to fall into the Territories of the Prince of <HI>Guriel.</HI> Which was that, they all mo&s;t ear|ne&s;tly de&s;ir'd, for that he had been the Occa&s;ion of the Incur|&s;ion of the <HI>Turks,</HI> and of all the &s;poil that had been commit|ted during the War. For this rea&s;on the Armies had cro&s;s'd the <HI>Pha&s;is</HI> Three Days before, &s;o that the opportunity fa|vour'd
<PB N="178" REF="99">
me, in regard there was no fear of meeting with any Soldiers.</P>
<P>The 1&s;t of <HI>Jan.</HI> 1673. I &s;tay'd at <HI>Cotatis</HI> to perform the Duties of Devotion. But as we were at dinner, my two <HI>Ca|puchins</HI> and I, with my two Guides and my <HI>Armenian,</HI> at the &s;ame table, according to the cu&s;tom of the Country, where Ma&s;ters and Servants eat all together, I &s;aw that Ra&s;cal of a Lacquey, of whom I have already made mention, enter the Room, together with an <HI>Armenian</HI> of <HI>Akalzik&egrave;</HI> and a Prie&s;t of <HI>Cotatis,</HI> who came along to &s;hew 'em the Hou&s;e However I was not very much &s;urpriz'd to &s;ee him. For it was a thing which I daily had in my thoughts, con&s;idering the rea&s;on I had to be jealous of the Rogue; neverthele&s;s I made no &s;hew of my fears: yet I could not but believe he was turn'd <HI>Turk,</HI> &s;eeing a white Turbant upon his Head. The Rogue enter'd the Room with a wild and furious A&s;pect, and &s;ate him down among my Servants, without &s;o much as &s;aying, <HI>By your leave.</HI> Which affront provok'd me to that degree, that I ask'd him, <HI>Wherefore he came in &s;uch a fury?</HI> He an&s;wer'd, <HI>That he came from</HI> Akalzik&egrave;, <HI>and that he had perform'd the Journey in two Days.</HI> 'Tis the wor&s;t way in the World, &s;aid I; be&s;ides that the Mountains are all cover'd with Snow, like tho&s;e that we pa&s;t, when we came from <HI>Gonia.</HI> You'll find it true, reply'd the Fellow, for you mu&s;t go along with me to <HI>Akalzik&egrave;:</HI> I have Orders to carry you thither. That may be, reply'd I, if thou ha&s;t a greater Power to force me, then I have to hinder thee. For I have nothing to do at <HI>Akalzik&egrave;,</HI> neither will I go thither. Boy, &s;aid I, thou art ill advis'd; forbear to give thy &s;elf the trouble to do me a Mi&s;chief; for GOD will ne|ver &s;uffer thy De&s;igns to pro&s;per to my harm. I paid thee at <HI>Tefflis</HI> all thou could&s;t demand: if thou art not &s;atisfi'd, &s;ay what 'tis thou requir'&s;t more.</P>
<P>I thus di&s;cours'd him, to try whether I could reduce him to Rea&s;on. To which he an&s;wer'd, That <HI>Tefflis</HI> was a Place where there is no Ju&s;tice to be had, but that at <HI>Akalzik&egrave;</HI> he &s;hould have Right done him. I reply'd, That without going &s;o far, for &s;o &s;light a Matter, he might find People enough at <HI>Cotatis</HI> able to decide the difference. All which I &s;poke in the milde&s;t Terms imaginable: which nothing mov'd this Vaga|bond, who turning to his Companion, bid him go and fetch the <HI>Turks.</HI> The Fellow ran out pre&s;ently, but this was only a Trick to &s;care me; for I found afterwards, there were no <HI>Turks</HI> that tarry'd till they were &s;ent for. However, I was
<PB N="179" REF="99">
extreamly terrifi'd, and gave my &s;elf over for lo&s;t. All this while the Prie&s;t of <HI>Cotatis</HI> was ignorant of what pa&s;t, for I &s;pake Turki&s;h, which he did not under&s;tand; and therefore he ask'd Fryer <HI>Angelo</HI> what was the Occa&s;ion of the Conte&s;t; who as &s;oon as he knew, which was &s;oon after, inform'd the Prie&s;t. I order'd Fryer <HI>Angelo</HI> to tell him what I had offer'd the Scoundrel to relea&s;e me of his Preten&s;ions, that Per&s;ons of Quality might judge of it, and of the Malice of the Rogue that would force me to <HI>Akalzik&egrave;.</HI></P>
<P>The Prie&s;t and &s;everal <HI>Georgians</HI> running in upon the noi&s;e that we made, took my part as to the Offer I had made, and de&s;ir'd the mi&s;erable fellow to take it; but the more they pre&s;s'd him, the more In&s;olent he grew, and the more audacious in his Threats. Which inflam'd me to that degree, that I was almo&s;t be&s;ides my &s;elf. <HI>Traytor,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>Then 'tis only thy own Wickedne&s;s puts thee upon this: I tell thee again, that by the help of God, no Man &s;hall carry me to</HI> Akalzike, and &s;o &s;aying, I flew upon him with my Sword in my Hand; but my Arms were held, while the Perfidious Rogue, to whom I intended the mi&s;chief, betook him&s;elf to flight, trembling and in great Di&s;order. After which I did not think my &s;elf &s;afe, but was willing to have made my e&s;cape. But <HI>Janarell</HI>'s Steward &s;tay'd me, giving me full a&s;&s;urance, that I &s;hould receive no Injury in his Ma&s;ters Hou&s;e, and that no <HI>Turks</HI> would come to meddle with me. Thereupon I advis'd with my two <HI>Capu|chins</HI> what cour&s;e to take, the Re&s;ult of which was, that Fryer <HI>Angelo</HI> the next Morning &s;hould continue his Journey for <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> and that Father <HI>Ju&s;tin</HI> of <HI>Legorn,</HI> for that was the Name of the <HI>Capuchin</HI> who was &s;ent after me, as I have &s;aid, and I, &s;hould tarry together. But the Principal Rea&s;on was, becau&s;e we could neither buy nor hire Hor&s;es: and we knew we &s;hould meet with none in <HI>Mingrelia;</HI> which oblig'd us to tarry and &s;end away the Hor&s;es empty, for my Compa|nion to make u&s;e of.</P>
<P>The 2d. Fryer <HI>Angelo</HI> &s;et forward with the Hor&s;es and the Men which we had hir'd at <HI>Tefflis.</HI> And I return'd to <HI>Chicaris,</HI> Eight Leagues di&s;tant from <HI>Cotatis,</HI> together with Father <HI>Ju|&s;tin.</HI> We made choice of this place to &s;tay and expect the &s;uc|ce&s;s of Fryer <HI>Angelo</HI>'s Journey, becau&s;e it was ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to <HI>Janarell</HI>'s Country-Hou&s;e, where he was with the Queen; from whom we might have a&s;&s;i&s;tance if occa&s;ion requir'd.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="100">
The 5th the Bi&s;hop and the Prince&s;s &s;ent for us to come to his Hou&s;e. Thither we therefore went, and din'd with 'em that Day, as we did &s;everal other times, that we made our Vi&s;its. The Queen was a very beautiful Per&s;on, as I have &s;aid, but her Demeanor &s;poil'd all, free even to Impudence. Her Actions and Di&s;cour&s;e were all ob&s;cene, without any re|&s;traint upon her &s;elf. Leudne&s;s appear'd in every thing &s;he &s;aid; which is no Vice, nor any Scandal in her Country, where Di&s;&s;olutene&s;s is an Evil &s;o common. Her Bi&s;hop <HI>Janarell</HI> devour'd her with his Eyes. Never was uncha&s;te Love, more open and le&s;s re&s;erv'd. There was no need of more then look|ing upon the two Lovers, to give an ea&s;ie gue&s;s at their Fami|liarity together. The Queen of <HI>Imiretta</HI> is &s;erv'd like the Prince&s;s of <HI>Mingrelia;</HI> only her Table is not &s;o well furni&s;h'd with Plate, but her Train is not &s;o mean by much.</P>
<P>The 8th a Gentleman whom the King of <HI>Imiretta</HI> had &s;ent to <HI>Tefflis,</HI> arriv'd at <HI>Janarell</HI>'s Hou&s;e; and gave the Queen an account of his Negotiation. He was &s;ent to borrow 800 Crowns, upon the Royal Crown which they offer'd to pawn: the Crown being &s;et with Pretious Stones, and might be worth Four Thou&s;and <HI>Pi&s;tols.</HI> Yet no body would lend any Money upon it. But the Prince of <HI>Georgia under&s;tanding</HI> the need which the King and Queen of <HI>Imiretta</HI> had of the Money, &s;ent 'em a Pre&s;ent; to the King, three Hor&s;es, a quantity of Arms, and a Thou&s;and Crowns in Silver; to the Queen &s;everal Pieces of Ti&s;&s;ue, Sattins and Taffata's, and Five Hunderd Crowns. And the rea&s;on why the <HI>Georgian</HI> Prince was &s;o kind, was to keep their Maje&s;ties &s;tedfa&s;t in their Re&s;olutions to adopt one of his Sons.</P>
<P>The 12th I went to wait upon the King: who was brought back from the Army by rea&s;on he was fallen Sick. He did us a great deal of Honour, &s;hew'd us Extraordinary Kindne&s;s, made us &s;it down by him, and di&s;cours'd us with much Fami|liarity. He complain'd to Father <HI>Ju&s;tin,</HI> for that he and his Companions had quitted <HI>Cotatis.</HI> Which the Father excus'd by alleadging the occa&s;ion of their Removal to have been the continual Wars, by which they had &s;uffer'd very much. I am &s;orry for it, reply'd the King, but I cannot help it; for I am a poor Blind Man, and they make me do what they plea&s;e them&s;elves. I dare not di&s;cover my &s;elf to any one whatever, I mi&s;tru&s;t all the World; and yet I &s;urrender my &s;elf to all, not daring to offend any Body, for fear of being A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by every Body. This poor Prince is young, and well &s;hap'd;
<PB N="181" REF="100">
and well &s;hap'd; and he always wears a Handkercher over the upper part of his Face, to wipe up the Rhume that di&s;tils from the holes of his Eyes, and to hide &s;uch a hideous &s;ight from tho&s;e that come to vi&s;it him. He is of a mild Di&s;po&s;iti|on, and a great Lover of Je&s;ts and Drollery. He told Father <HI>Ju&s;tin,</HI> He &s;hould do well to Marry in his Country. To which Father <HI>Ju&s;tin</HI> made an&s;wer, That he could not Marry, as being under the &s;ame Vow with the Bi&s;hops and Monks of <HI>Imiretta. How!</HI> &s;aid he, interrupting Father <HI>Ju&s;tin,</HI> and bur&s;t|ing out into a great laughter, <HI>our Bi&s;hops and Monks have every one nine apiece, be&s;ides tho&s;e of their Neighbours.</HI></P>
<P>The 16th by break of Day I was to my great &s;atisfaction wak'nd by my Comrade that came along with me to <HI>Mingre|lia,</HI> Who told me, That Fryer <HI>Angelo,</HI> together with the Men and Hor&s;es which I had &s;ent, were arriv'd the ninth at <HI>Sippias;</HI> where they were extraordinarily troubl'd and almo&s;t at their Wits end, becau&s;e they had heard no News of me &s;ince my departure and for that they could not either for Love or Money get any Hor&s;es to carry 'em into <HI>Georgia.</HI> That under&s;tanding my happy arrival at <HI>Tefflis,</HI> and that I &s;taid near <HI>Cotatis</HI> in expectation of him, he was overjoy'd, and that he forthwith prepar'd him&s;elf for his Journey, having taken out of the Earth, the Woods, and from between the Tiles of the Hou&s;e the one half of what they had had there. That he had &s;taid till the 'leventh day, to the end he might re&s;t his Hor&s;es; leaving one of the mo&s;t faithful of our Servants to take care of the re&s;t, which they dur&s;t not remove, for fear of endangering all at one venture. And after he had told me thus far, Ne'er trouble your &s;elf, &s;aid he at length, at what I have told ye; GOD be thanked all's &s;afe and well And then proceeding,</P>
<P><HI>Saturday</HI> the 14th, &s;aid he, we came &s;afe and well to <HI>Cota|tis</HI> about eight in the Evening: at what time Fryer <HI>Angelo</HI> car|ry'd me to <HI>Janatelle</HI>'s. By the way, I never heard, &s;aid he, till ye&s;terday, how your Servant that you di&s;mi&s;s'd, came to threaten ye the fir&s;t day of the Year as he did, for had I known it, I &s;hould ne're have &s;topp'd at <HI>Cotatis.</HI> But then, neither Fryer <HI>Angelo</HI> nor any of our People thinking more of it, de|&s;ir'd me upon <HI>Sunday</HI> Morning, that they might &s;tay till Noon, and refre&s;h them&s;elves a little. To which I con&s;ented, and bid'em get a good Dinner. But as I &s;ate at Table, I &s;aw the Rogue of a Lacquey come into the Room with Twenty Armed Janizaries. Where's my Ma&s;ter? Cry'd the Young
<PB N="182" REF="101">
<HI>Ragamuffin,</HI> he would have Murder'd me, but I'll do his Bu|&s;ine&s;s for him now. And &s;o &s;aying, he lookt about the Room for yee, and not finding yee there, he went into your Chamber, thinking you had hid up your &s;elf. I follow'd him, and throw|ing my &s;elf at his Feet, What have I done to yee, that you &s;hould go about to ruine me? If my Comrade have mi&s;-us'd yee, or not pay'd yee to your content, that's no fault of mine; make your demands, and you &s;hall have it without more ado, only &s;end away the&s;e <HI>Turks</HI> that you have brought along with yee. It &s;hall be done, reply'd the Young Traytor, I'll go and di&s;mi&s;s the <HI>Turks,</HI> and come again pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>And &s;o &s;aying, he went back into the Hall, pointing to Fryer <HI>Angelo,</HI> There, &s;aid he to the Jani&s;aries, take that Man, and carry him to the Commander of the Fortre&s;s; and &s;o at the &s;ame time the poor Fryer was &s;eiz'd and carry'd away. The Jani&s;aries look'd up and down to &s;ee what Booty they could find; and pre&s;ently they &s;natch'd up our Felts that &s;erv'd us for Cloaks: they did not &s;o much as meet with any of my Arms, and which was a more &s;ignal mark of GOD's Providence, they mi&s;t the Bags which I brought along with me, where were above Fifty Thou&s;and Crowns in Gold and Jewels. As &s;oon as the Jani&s;aries had left the Hou&s;e, I &s;ent a Man after Fryer <HI>Angelo,</HI> and conjur'd the Carriers to let us make our e&s;eape with all &s;peed. So that we Saddl'd and Loaded our Hor&s;es forthwith, and be|took our &s;elves to flight with all the ha&s;te we could. Thus GOD a&s;&s;i&s;ted me, and by his Grace and Favour <HI>I</HI> am at length got hither, with all that <HI>I</HI> was entru&s;ted with in <HI>Mingrelia.</HI> For what the Jani&s;aries took was hardly worth two <HI>Pi&s;tols.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I</HI> might here endeavour to expre&s;s the Joy and Satisfaction which <HI>I</HI> receiv'd upon the rehear&s;al of the&s;e happy Tydings, but they are only to be imagin'd, nor is it that which the Rea|der de&s;ires to know. Father <HI>Ju&s;tin</HI> went pre&s;ently to the Queen and <HI>Janatelle,</HI> to make his complaints of what the <HI>Turks</HI> had done in his Hou&s;e, and to de&s;ire him to labour for the Li|berty of Fryer <HI>Angelo:</HI> and about Noon the Father return'd and a&s;&s;ur'd us, that they had &s;ent two Gentlemen to that purpo&s;e, to the Commander of the Fortre&s;s. For my part <HI>I</HI> would have been gone pre&s;ently, &s;uch was my dread of the <HI>Turks,</HI> though without any ground: but there was a nece&s;&s;ity for us to let our Hor&s;es re&s;t. In the mean time, in the Afternoon my Comrade hir'd other Hor&s;es to return into <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> and fetch what was left behind; while <HI>I</HI> prepar'd to &s;et forward for <HI>Tefflis,</HI> with that which he had already brought.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="101">
The 17th my Comrade and I parted, taking each our &s;everal Roads: he for <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> with Five Men and Four Hor&s;es; I for <HI>Tefflis,</HI> with Father <HI>Ju&s;tin,</HI> Three Men and Three Hor&s;es.</P>
<P>The 22th at Night, I arriv'd at <HI>Gori;</HI> where I &s;tay'd two Days to change Gold, as well to a&s;&s;i&s;t Father <HI>Ju&s;tin</HI> to make preparations for his return to <HI>Cotatis,</HI> whither he was to carry my Comrade Money, and to accompany him from thence to <HI>Tefflis,</HI> as to get Fryer <HI>Angelo</HI> &s;et at Liberty, if he &s;hould be detain'd a Pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>To which purpo&s;e, Father <HI>Ju&s;tin</HI> departed the 25th in the Morning for <HI>Cotatis,</HI> and I at the &s;ame time &s;et forward for <HI>Tefflis.</HI> Where I arriv'd thanks be to GOD the 26th in the Afternoon, with the <HI>Capuchin</HI> Fryer which the Superiour of <HI>Gori</HI> had lent me, as not being willing to leave me without Company.</P>
<P>The 6th of <HI>February</HI> in the Evening, my Comrade arriv'd at <HI>Tefflis,</HI> with the Servants which I had left in <HI>Colchis,</HI> a <HI>The|atin Fryer</HI> and Father <HI>Angelo.</HI> After I had embrac'd 'em all, Fryer <HI>Angelo</HI> took me a&s;ide, to give me an accompt of the Se|ries of the whole Adventure. You know, &s;aid he, after what manner your perfidious Lacquey caus'd me to be apprehended by the Jani&s;aries, who were &s;ent by the Commander of the Fortre&s;s to &s;eize me. For the Ra&s;cal had told the Commander how that you ow'd him Three Hunderd Crowns; that you were an Amba&s;&s;ador; that you had been in <HI>Mingrelia</HI> to fetch away a va&s;t Trea&s;ure, which you had left there; and that by the &s;eizure of your Per&s;on, he would meet with a pur|cha&s;e that would enrich him for ever. This Traytor pre&s;s'd the Jani&s;aries, who carry'd me to the Fortre&s;s to bind me, and u&s;e me &s;everely; but they had a greater re&s;pect and veneration for my habit: and be&s;ide there was among 'em an <HI>Italian Re|negado</HI> who caus'd 'em to be very civil. I march'd along as &s;lowly as po&s;&s;ibly I could, and kept the Ra&s;cals in di&s;cour&s;e, to the end I might give your Comrade the more lei&s;ure to make his e&s;cape; for I made no que&s;tion but he would take that cour&s;e. When they brought me before the Commander, he ask'd the Varlet who had caus'd me to be apprehended, whe|ther I was his Ma&s;ter, who an&s;wer'd, No; for that he could not find his Ma&s;ter; but that a&s;&s;uredly I knew where he was. I reply'd, I knew not where you were, only that when I left yee, you had a de&s;ign to go for <HI>Tefflis.</HI> The Commander ask'd me afterwards, &s;everal Que&s;tions concerning your Quali|ty;
<PB N="184" REF="102">
and told me that I mu&s;t pay the Three Hunderd Crowns, which it was &s;aid you ow'd the fellow. To which I an&s;wer'd, That you were no more then a poor Per&s;on in Holy Orders, who had undertaken to give me Intelligence of the Mi&s;erable Con|dition of tho&s;e in <HI>Mingrelia.</HI> Which when I under&s;tood, I went to give 'em a Vi&s;it; that I was no farther acquainted with your concerns; and that as for Money I had none. And that the People in <HI>Cotatis,</HI> from the Prince to the meane&s;t of his Subjects, well knew, that I was a Per&s;on that made a profe&s;|&s;ion of Poverty.</P>
<P>Upon this, the Commander order'd me to be &s;earch'd, and they found the Girdle which you had &s;ent me to wear, where there was no more then only Six Pound, for by a wonderful Providence of God, your Comrade had not given me any Je|wels to quilt into it, according to your appointment. There|upon the Commander finding no more then that incon&s;iderable Sum, &s;aid he to the Lacquey, Where is all the Trea&s;ure, ye Rogue, with which thou ha&s;t fill'd my Head? bring'&s;t thou me hither this poor Fellow to jeer me? Thou art a cheating Ra&s;cal, and I'll have thee Drubb'd to Death. Sir, an&s;wer'd the Varlet, trembling for fear, The Wealth is in the Cu&s;tody of my Ma&s;ter's Comrade, that lies at <HI>Janatelle</HI>'s. Dog, as thou art, reply'd the Commander, Why did&s;t not bring him hither? And &s;o &s;aying, He &s;ent him back with the &s;ame Jani&s;aries that had guarded me to the Fortre&s;s, and commanded 'em expre&s;ly to bring away your Comrade: and indeed I was afraid they would have met with him; but I was overjoy'd, when the Jani&s;aries return'd and told the Commander, that the Per&s;on had made his e&s;cape. Which made him vent his Rage upon the La quey, who was in a &s;trange Agony, between Fear and Madne&s;s: at what time he began to open his Eyes, and to perceive that GOD had confounded his Malice, by his mi&s;&s;ing your Comrade with all that he carry'd under his care. There|upon I gave an accompt to the Commander of all the Villa|nies, and wicked Tricks which the Ra&s;cal had committed in your Service, and how liberal and kind you had been to him neverthele&s;s, in paying him his Wages.</P>
<P>That Evening the Commander invited me to &s;up with him at his own Table: for he under&s;tood I was a Phy&s;itian, and pre&s;ently fanci'd him&s;elf to be ill. So that I made him up &s;ome Medecins, as well for him&s;elf, as for &s;ome of the Souldiers that were in the Fortre&s;s. He order'd an Italian <HI>Renegado</HI> to be my Guards, at what time your Lacquey would have had him
<PB N="185" REF="102">
laid me in Irons for fear I &s;hould make my e&s;cape. For the Ra&s;cal &s;tudy'd a Thou&s;and Tricks to do me a Mi&s;chief. But the next Day the Queen and <HI>Janatelle</HI> &s;ent two Gentlemen to the Commander to demand my Freedom, as being their Phy|&s;itian, and the King's al&s;o: and about Noon there came two Gentlemen more from a great Lord of the Country, who&s;e Wife lay &s;ick; and he had been inform'd, that I was a Pris|ner in the Fortre&s;s for Debt. Thereupon he &s;ent to the Com|mander of the Fortre&s;s, to relea&s;e me, and he would pay my Debt: but alas, there was nothing more clear then that I ow'd nothing. However, I mu&s;t give Twenty Five Crowns to the Commander; which being paid, I was &s;et at Liberty, notwith&s;tanding the Noi&s;e and Clamour of the Lacquey, who pre&s;s'd that I might not be releas'd, and told the Commander, That there would be a Thou&s;and Crowns giv'n to purcha&s;e my Liberty, rather then let me lie. So &s;oon as I was free, they carry'd me to the Lords Hou&s;e, to whom I was beholding for my Liberty; from whence I &s;ent to <HI>Chicaris</HI> to know what News: by the return of which Me&s;&s;age, I under&s;tood that you were gone to <HI>Tefflis,</HI> and your Comrade was return'd to <HI>Mingrelia.</HI> Some few Days after Father <HI>Ju&s;tin</HI> arriv'd at <HI>Chi|caris,</HI> and under&s;tanding there where I was, he came to me; and then having repaid the Twenty Five Crowns which the Lord had disburs'd for my Deliverance out of Pri&s;on, we re|turn'd to <HI>Chicaris.</HI> Where in two Days your Comrade arriv'd with all that was left behind of yours in <HI>Mingrelia:</HI> who told us what Road he had tak'n to mi&s;s <HI>Cotatis.</HI> To which pur|po&s;e he had Ferry'd over the <HI>Pha&s;is</HI> &s;ix Leagues from that City; at what time the Ferryman told him, That the Rogue who had laid &s;o many Snares for us, had giv'n two Crowns to give him Intelligence of your Comrade's Pa&s;&s;age: and that the Villain was under the Guard of four Jani&s;aries, who had order not to let him e&s;cape: for that the Commander was re&s;olv'd to make him perform what he had promis'd him. And thus you &s;ee, &s;aid he, that hitherto all things have luckily &s;ucceeded, and that GOD has confounded that Villain in his Wickedne&s;s, who&s;e Ju&s;tice que&s;tionle&s;s will not permit him to e&s;cape the Clutches of the Turki&s;h Commander, without receiving &s;ome Puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>It was now late; neverthele&s;s my Comrade and I could not go to Supper, till we had di&s;cours'd of the happy I&s;&s;ue of our Labour, and of all our Misfortunes, of which, what I have recounted, is but a part of the Truth; nor till we had breath'd
<PB N="186" REF="103">
out to GOD our Ardent Thank&s;givings for his Infinite Good|ne&s;s, his Omnipotent, and his Miraculous Deliverance: For we expected no &s;uch thing, when we were in Tribulation. And indeed, who could have hop'd to have &s;av'd all, when we were in &s;uch imminent danger of lo&s;ing all? The next Day following we ca&s;t up the Accompts of our Lo&s;&s;es in this Di&s;|a&s;trous Journey, and found that it did not amount to more then above one <HI>per Cent.</HI> of all that we had &s;av'd, and fortu|nately brought to <HI>Tefflis,</HI> without any thing being either bro|ken or &s;poil'd.</P>
<P><HI>GEORGIA,</HI> I mean all the Country &s;o call'd which is under the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Juri&s;diction, borders at this day to the Ea&s;t upon <HI>Circa&s;&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Mo&s;covy;</HI> to the We&s;t upon <HI>Armenia</HI> the <HI>Le&s;s;</HI> to the South upon <HI>Armenia</HI> the <HI>Greater;</HI> to the North upon the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI> and that part of <HI>Colchis</HI> which is call'd <HI>Imiretta,</HI> which in my Opinion is all that Country which the Ancients nam'd <HI>Iberia. Georgia</HI> extended formerly from <HI>Tauris</HI> and <HI>Erzerum</HI> to the River <HI>Tanais,</HI> and was call'd <HI>Albania,</HI> being bounded, as I have de&s;crib'd it. It is a Country very full of Wood, and ve|ry Mountainous, that enclo&s;e a greater Number of plea&s;ant Plains that run out in length, but are not proportionable in breadth: only the middle of <HI>Georgia</HI> is more even and level then the re&s;t: And the River <HI>Kur,</HI> which mo&s;t Geographers call <HI>Cyrus,</HI> runs through the mid&s;t of it. It takes its ri&s;e in the Mountain <HI>Cauca&s;us,</HI> a Day and a half's Journey from <HI>Akal|zik&egrave;,</HI> as has been &s;aid; and empties it &s;elf into the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea.</P>
<P>I have &s;een &s;ome old <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Geographies, that place <HI>Georgia</HI> in the Greater <HI>Armenia.</HI> The Moderns make a particular Pro|vince of it, which they call <HI>Gorgi&s;tan,</HI> and divide into four parts; <HI>Imiretta,</HI> of which we have &s;poken; the Country of <HI>Guriel,</HI> wherein is comprehended all that is under the Govern|ment of <HI>Akalzik&egrave;;</HI> the Kingdom of <HI>Caket,</HI> which extends it &s;elf very far into Mount <HI>Cauca&s;us,</HI> and is properly the Ancient <HI>Iberia;</HI> and <HI>Carthuel,</HI> which is the Ea&s;tern <HI>Georgia,</HI> and which the Ancient Geographers call the <HI>A&s;iatick Albania.</HI> The King|doms of <HI>Caket</HI> and <HI>Carthuel</HI> are under the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Dominion: and this is that which the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> call <HI>Gurgi&s;tan:</HI> but the <HI>Geor|gians</HI> give it no other Name then that of <HI>Carthueli.</HI> Which is no new Name, as being to be found in the Writings of &s;eve|ral Ancient Authors, although &s;omewhat corrupted; e&s;pecially St <HI>Epiphanias,</HI> who &s;peaking of the&s;e People, calls 'em <HI>Cardi|ans.</HI> It's reported that the <HI>Grecians</HI> were the fir&s;t who gave
<PB N="187" REF="103">
'em the Name of <HI>Georgians</HI> from the word <HI>Georgoi,</HI> which &s;ig|nifies Husbandmen. Though others will have this Name to derive it &s;elf from that of St. <HI>George,</HI> the Patron Saint of all the Chri&s;tians of the Greek Church.</P>
<P>There are very few Cities in all <HI>Georgia,</HI> as has been ob|&s;erv'd: though there has been many more formerly in the Kingdom of <HI>Caket.</HI> But now they lie all in Ruines unle&s;s one which is al&s;o call'd <HI>Kaket.</HI> And I heard &s;ay, while I &s;tay'd at <HI>Tefflis,</HI> that the&s;e Cities were very large and &s;umptuou&s;ly Built, as may be well enough conjectur'd, as well by that which is not as yet altogether de&s;troy'd, as by the ruines them|&s;elves. Now the&s;e Northern Inhabitants of Mount <HI>Cauca&s;us,</HI> tho&s;e <HI>Alans, Suans, Huns</HI> and other Nations &s;o greatly fam'd for their &s;trength and Courage, and by the Report of many People, another Nation of the <HI>Amazons,</HI> were they that con|tinually harra&s;s'd and ran&s;ackt this little Kingdom of <HI>Kaket.</HI> The <HI>Amazons</HI> lay bordering upon it above, to the North. Wherein as well the Ancient as Modern Geographers agree. <HI>Ptolomy</HI> fixes their Country in the <HI>A&s;iatic Sarmatia,</HI> which is now call'd <HI>Tartary,</HI> to the We&s;t of <HI>Volga,</HI> between the River and the <HI>Hippic</HI> Mountains: and there it is that the Northern part of the Kingdom of <HI>Kaket</HI> exactly lies. <HI>Quintus Curtius</HI> &s;ays al&s;o to the &s;ame effect, that the Kingdom of <HI>Thale&s;tris</HI> was near to the River <HI>Pha&s;is.</HI> And <HI>Strabo</HI> is of the &s;ame opi|nion, &s;peaking of the Expeditions of <HI>Pompey</HI> and <HI>Canidius.</HI> I confe&s;s, I never &s;aw any Per&s;on in <HI>Georgia</HI> who had been in the Country of the <HI>Amazons;</HI> but I have heard many of 'em tell Stories of tho&s;e People. And they &s;hew'd me in the Prince's Palace, a large Female habit of a cour&s;e Woollen Stuff, and peculiar for its Fa&s;hion and Shape, which they &s;aid was the Garment of an <HI>Amazon,</HI> that was &s;lain near <HI>Caket</HI> in the la&s;t Wars. Shortly we may hear farther news of the&s;e Famous Warriours; for the <HI>Capuchins</HI> of <HI>Tefflis</HI> told me, they would &s;end two Mi&s;&s;ionaries into their Country: the Congregation having order'd that they &s;hould be di&s;patch'd thither. I had once a long di&s;cour&s;e with the Prince of <HI>Georgia</HI>'s Son upon this Sub|ject; at what time, among other things he told me, that Five Days Journey beyond <HI>Caket</HI> toward the North, there liv'd a Numerous People, of whom they had no knowledge at all; who were continually at War with the <HI>Tartars,</HI> which they call <HI>Calmac,</HI> and the &s;ame with tho&s;e which we call <HI>Calmou|qus:</HI> that the &s;everal People that inhabit Mount <HI>Cauca&s;us</HI> are continually at Wars one with another; and that it &s;ignifies no|thing
<PB N="188" REF="104">
to make any Peace or Truce with 'em, as being a &s;ort of Savages, that have neither Religion, Government nor Laws. Therefore they that lie next to <HI>Caket</HI> make frequent Inroads into the Country: which obliges the <HI>Viceroy,</HI> who is the Elde&s;t Son of the Prince of <HI>Georgia,</HI> to be always ready in Arms to repel tho&s;e Barbarians.</P>
<P>Upon the Information which I gave the Young Prince, of what the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Hi&s;torians related concerning the <HI>Amazons,</HI> after I had di&s;cours'd for &s;ome time upon that occa|&s;ion, his opinion was, that they were &s;ome particular People among the wandring <HI>Scythians,</HI> as the <HI>Turcomans,</HI> and <HI>Arabs,</HI> who &s;ubmitted them&s;elves to the Soveraignty of Women, like the <HI>Achine&s;es:</HI> that tho&s;e Queens made u&s;e of Per&s;ons of their own Sex to &s;erve 'em, and to follow 'em where-ever they went. And as for their riding a Hor&s;eback like Men, it is ea|&s;ily apprehended and as ea&s;ie to be credited, and that they al&s;o were Arm'd. For in the Ea&s;tern Countries, all Women be|&s;tride their Hor&s;es like Men: and &s;ome of 'em mount their Hor&s;es and ride 'em as well, be&s;ides that the Prince&s;&s;es al&s;o wear Daggers at their &s;ides. But as for the Mutilation of their Brea&s;ts, and other particulars reported of the <HI>Amazons,</HI> we re|ject 'em, and rank 'em among the Fables, with which the lea|&s;ing <HI>Greeks</HI> had the Impudence to fill their Hi&s;tories, according to the Sarca&s;m of the Latin Poet.</P>
<P>The Province of <HI>Carthuel</HI> contains no more then Four Ci|ties, <HI>Gory, Suram, Aly</HI> and <HI>Tefflis. Gory</HI> is a &s;mall City, &s;eated in a Plain between two Mountains upon the Bank of the River <HI>Curr,</HI> at the Foot of a Hillock, upon which there is a Fortre&s;s Built which is Gari&s;on'd by Native <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI> It was Built in the la&s;t <HI>Gurgi&s;tan</HI> Wars, about Forty Years &s;ince by <HI>Ru&s;tan Can,</HI> General of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Army: and an <HI>Au&s;tin Monk,</HI> who was then at <HI>Gory</HI> drew the draught of it. How|ever the Fortre&s;s is a place that is not able to make any great defence; its principal &s;trength con&s;i&s;ting in its Situation, ha|ving a Hunderd Men within it: Nor is the City that lies under it but very &s;mall, the Hou&s;es and Market Places being all Built of Earth. The Inhabitants however, are all very Rich and Wealthy. And it is very well &s;tor'd with all things nece&s;&s;ary for Human &s;upport at a cheap rate.</P>
<P><HI>Suram</HI> is indeed no more then a Town not above half as big as the City of <HI>Gory;</HI> but the Fortre&s;s adjoyning is large and well Built, having within it a Hunderd Men in Gari&s;on. Near to <HI>Suram</HI> is the Country call'd <HI>Sema&s;h&egrave;.</HI> Which in the
<PB N="189" REF="104">
<HI>Georgian</HI> Language &s;ignifies <HI>Three Ca&s;tles.</HI> The People of this Country boa&s;t, That <HI>Noah</HI> dwelt in this Country after he came out of the <HI>Ark,</HI> and that his three Sons built 'em every one a Ca&s;tle. I &s;ay nothing here of <HI>Aly,</HI> becau&s;e I have &s;pok'n of it in another place.</P>
<P>The Temper of the Air is very kindly in <HI>Georgia;</HI> being ve|ry dry, cold in the Winter, and hot in the Summer. Their fair Weather does not begin till <HI>May,</HI> but it la&s;ts till the end of <HI>November.</HI> The Soyl mu&s;t be well water'd, or el&s;e it proves very barren; but that care tak'n, it produces all &s;orts of Grain, Herbs and Fruits in abundance. <HI>Georgia</HI> is therefore as fertile a Country as any can be imagin'd, where a Man may live both deliciou&s;ly and very cheap. Their Bread is as good as any in the World: their Fruit is delicious and of all &s;orts. Neither is there any part of <HI>Europe</HI> that produces fairer Pears and Ap|ples, or better ta&s;ted, nor does any part of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> bring forth more delicious Pomegranates. Cattel are very plentiful and ve|ry good, as well the larger &s;ort as the le&s;&s;er. Their Fowl of all &s;orts is incomparable, e&s;pecially their Wild-Fowl: Their Boars-Fle&s;h is as plentiful and as good as any in <HI>Colchis.</HI> The Common People live upon nothing el&s;e but young Porkers; of which there are abundance in all parts of the Country: and indeed there is no better Food in the World, then this Meat: be&s;ide that the People of the Country a&s;&s;ure us, that it never offends the Stomach, let 'em eat never &s;o much. Which I believe to be true; for though I eat of it almo&s;t every Meal, yet it never did me harm. The <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, which is next to <HI>Georgia,</HI> and the <HI>Kurr,</HI> that runs quite through it, &s;upplies it with all &s;orts of &s;alt and fre&s;h Fi&s;h; &s;o that we may truly &s;ay That there is no Country where a Man may have an Oppor|tunity to fare better then in this.</P>
<P>And with the &s;ame boldne&s;s we may a&s;&s;ert, That there is no Country where they drink more or better Wine. The Vines grow about the Trees as in <HI>Colchis:</HI> and they daily tran&s;port great Quantities of Wine into <HI>Media, Armenia,</HI> and to <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> for the Kings Table. As much as a Hor&s;e can carry, which is 300 weight, co&s;ts no more then Twelve Shillings: I &s;peak of their be&s;t Wine; for the common &s;ort is cheaper by half: and all other Provi&s;ions are at a proportionable rate. The Coun|try of <HI>Georgia</HI> al&s;o produces a great Quantity of Silk; tho not &s;o much by half as mo&s;t Travellers report: But the People of the Country know not how to weave it, and therefore they
<PB N="190" REF="105">
carry it into <HI>Turkey,</HI> to <HI>Erzerum,</HI> and the parts adjoyning, where they drive a great Trade.</P>
<P>The Complexion of the <HI>Georgians</HI> is the mo&s;t beautiful in all the Ea&s;t; and I can &s;afely &s;ay, That I never &s;aw an ill-fa|vour'd Countenance in all that Country, either of the one or other Sex: but I have &s;een tho&s;e that have had Angels Faces; Nature having be&s;tow'd upon the Women of that Country Graces and Features, which are not other where to be &s;een: So that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to behold 'em without falling in Love. More Charming Countenances, nor more Lovely Statures and Proportions cannot be Pencill'd forth by all the Art of Man, then tho&s;e of the <HI>Georgian</HI> Women. They are Tall, clear Limb'd, Plump and Full, but not over Fat, and extreamly Slender in the Wa&s;te: Let 'em have never &s;o few Cloaths on, you &s;hall not &s;ee their Hips. That which &s;poils all is this, that they all Paint, as well the Lovely as le&s;s Beautiful. For they make u&s;e of Paint in &s;tead of other Ornaments: Never|thele&s;s when they Dre&s;s them&s;elves, they Deck them&s;elves in Sumptuous Habits and Jewels as our Women do.</P>
<P>The <HI>Georgians</HI> al&s;o are Naturally very Witty. Nor would there be more Learned Men, or more Ingenious Ma&s;ters in the World, were they but improv'd by the Knowledge of Arts and Sciences: but their Education is &s;o mean and paltry, that ha|ving nothing but bad Examples before their Eyes, tho&s;e Parts of theirs are altogether drown'd in Vice and Ignorance. VVhich is the rea&s;on that they are generally Cheats and Knaves, per|fidious, treacherous, ingrateful and proud. Impudent beyond Imagination to deny their own VVords, and their very Deeds; to &s;et afoot and maintain Fal&s;hood; to demand more then is their Due; to counterfeit Deeds and forge Lyes. They are irreconcileable in their Enmities, and never forgive. True it is, they are not ea&s;ily provok'd; nor do they readily admit tho&s;e Hatreds which they pre&s;erve inviolably when once con|ceiv'd. And be&s;ides the&s;e Vices of the Mind, no Men are more addicted to their &s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ures and Be&s;tial Voluptu|ou&s;ne&s;s; that is to &s;ay, to Drunkenne&s;s and Luxury. In which filthy Diverti&s;ements, they plunge them&s;elves with &s;o much the more freedom, becau&s;e they are &s;o common, and not lookt upon as &s;candalous in <HI>Georgia.</HI> The Church-men will be as drunk as others, and keep Female Slaves in their Hou&s;es, to make u&s;e of in &s;tead of Concubines: at which no body is of|fended, as being no more then what is generally practis'd, and as it were authoriz'd by Cu&s;tom. In &s;o much that the Superiour
<PB N="191" REF="105">
of the <HI>Capuchins</HI> a&s;&s;ur'd me, That he had heard the <HI>Catholicos,</HI> or <HI>Patriarch</HI> of <HI>Georgia</HI> &s;ay, That he who was not ab&s;olutely drunk at great Fe&s;tivals, &s;uch as <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI> could not be a good Chri&s;tian, and de&s;erv'd to be Excommuni|cated. Be&s;ides this, the <HI>Georgians</HI> are likewi&s;e very great U&s;urers: They never lend any Money without a Pawn, and the lowe&s;t Intere&s;t which they take is Two in the Hunderd for a Month.</P>
<P>Neither are the Women le&s;s Vicious and Wicked then the Men. They have an Extraordinary Addiction to the Male Sex; and certainly contribute more then they, to that Torrent of Uncleanne&s;s which overflows all the Country. On the other &s;ide, the <HI>Georgians</HI> are Civil and Courteous, and more then that, they are Grave and Moderate. Their Manners and Cu|&s;toms are a Mixture of the &s;everal Cu&s;toms of the Nations that lie round about 'em. Which proceeds, as I believe from their Commerce and Dealings with Variety of People, and the Liberty allow'd in <HI>Georgia,</HI> to ob&s;erve their own Religion and Cu&s;toms, and to defend 'em in their di&s;cour&s;e. You &s;hall meet here in this Country with <HI>Armenians, Greeks, Jews, Turks, Per&s;ians, Indians, Tartars, Mu&s;covites</HI> and <HI>Europeans;</HI> and the <HI>Armenians</HI> are &s;o numerous, that they exceed the <HI>Geor|gians.</HI> They are al&s;o more Wealthy, and for the mo&s;t part &s;upply all the &s;mall Offices and mean Employments. But the <HI>Georgians</HI> are &s;touter, more Haughty, more Vain, and more Pompous. Which difference between their Inclinations, their Manners and their Belief, has caus'd a very great Enmity be|tween 'em. They mutually hate one another, and never Marry into one anothers Families. Particularly the <HI>Georgians</HI> contemn the <HI>Armenians</HI> with a more then ordinary Scorn; and look up|on 'em much about the &s;ame Rate as we do the <HI>Jews</HI> in <HI>Europe.</HI> The <HI>Georgian</HI> Habit re&s;embles very much the <HI>Polonian</HI> Garb, their Bonnets being like to theirs. Their Ve&s;ts are open be|fore all down the Brea&s;t, and fa&s;ten'd with Buttons and Loops. Their Ho&s;e and Shooes are like tho&s;e of the <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI> And for the Womens habit it is altogether <HI>Per&s;ian.</HI></P>
<P>The Hou&s;es of the Grandees, and all their Public Edifices, are Built according to the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Models: nor is Building at all expen&s;ive, as having Wood, Stone, Lime and Plai&s;ter in great Abundance; they al&s;o imitate the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> in &s;itting at their Tables, in their Beds, and manner of Dyet.</P>
<P>The Nobility exerci&s;e a more then Tyrannical Power over their Subjects; far wor&s;e then in <HI>Colchis.</HI> They will make their
<PB N="192" REF="106">
Pea&s;ants labour whole. Months together, and as much as they plea&s;e without allowing 'em either Food or Wages. They chal|lenge a Right over the E&s;tates Liberty and Lives of their Va&s;|&s;als: they take their Childern and &s;ell 'em, or el&s;e make Slaves of 'em them&s;elves. But they very &s;eldom &s;ell any of the Rabble above Twenty Years of Age, e&s;pecially Women.</P>
<P>The Belief of the <HI>Georgians</HI> is like that of the <HI>Mingrelians;</HI> as having been converted to the Faith both at the &s;ame time, in the Fourth Age, and by the &s;ame means of an <HI>Iberian</HI> Woman, who was converted her &s;elf to Chri&s;tianity at <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> But &s;ince that, both the one and the other have lo&s;t all &s;ence of Chri&s;tianity; &s;o that as I have &s;aid of the <HI>Mingrelians;</HI> they have nothing remaining of Chri&s;tianity but the Name. So is it as true that the <HI>Georgians</HI> neither ob&s;erve or know the lea&s;t precept of the Law of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Neverthele&s;s the <HI>Geor|gians</HI> more &s;trictly ob&s;erve their Fa&s;ts, and make longer Prayers. VVhile I was at <HI>Tefflis,</HI> the Mi&s;&s;ionaries &s;ent to <HI>Rome</HI> a Relation of the State of their Mi&s;&s;ion, which they &s;hew'd me; wherein I found one very plea&s;ant pa&s;&s;age, which I &s;hall &s;et down among the re&s;t as not being either un|&s;ea&s;onable or impertinent. There was a VVoman at <HI>Gory,</HI> who having led a very ill Life, at length fell dangerou&s;ly ill, in&s;omuch that &s;he thought &s;he &s;hould die. VVhereupon &s;he &s;ent for a Prie&s;t, and made her Confe&s;&s;ion, di&s;cover'd to him all her Leud Pranks, and made him great Prote&s;tations, that if &s;he recover'd, &s;he would never admit of any other Man but her Husband. To whom, the Prie&s;t, <HI>Madam,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>I know yee too well, to believe yee: it will be impo&s;&s;ible for yee to leave off the Company of your</HI> Gallants. <HI>My reque&s;t therefore is, that you will entertain no more then Two or Three, which I will allow yee to do upon that Condition, which I &s;hall impo&s;e upon yee.</HI> But the VVoman di&s;daining the Propo&s;al of her Confe&s;&s;or, put him out of her Hou&s;e and &s;ending for a <HI>Capuchin,</HI> told him the whole Story, and afterwards made her Confe&s;&s;ion to him. The &s;ame Relation adds, that the Prie&s;ts enjoyn their Peni|tents that confefs the taking of another Bodies Goods, to bring the Goods to Them, and not to re&s;tore 'em to the Right Ow|ners; &s;o that Re&s;titution is never made.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal Bi&s;hops in <HI>Georgia,</HI> an <HI>Archbi&s;hop</HI> and a <HI>Patriarch,</HI> whom they call <HI>Catholicos.</HI> Who&s;e preferments when Vacant are &s;upply'd by the Prince though a <HI>Mahometan,</HI> who generally prefers his kindred and Relations: &s;o that the Pre&s;ent <HI>Patriarch</HI> is his Brother. As for the Churches in
<PB N="193" REF="106">
<HI>Georgia,</HI> they are &s;omething more cleanly kept then tho&s;e in <HI>Mingrelia.</HI> And in the Cities you &s;hall &s;ee &s;ome that are very decent, though they are altogether as na&s;ty in the Country. The <HI>Georgians,</HI> as all the other Chri&s;tians that &s;urround 'em to the North and We&s;t, have a &s;trange humour to build all their Churches upon high Mountains, in remote and almo&s;t in|acce&s;&s;ible Places. Where they view 'em, and bow to 'em at the di&s;tance of three or four Leagues: but &s;eldom or never go into 'em; and we may boldly a&s;&s;ert, that the mo&s;t part of 'em are hardly open'd once in Ten Years. They erect 'em, and then leave 'em to the Injuries of the Weather and for the Birds and Fowls of the Air to build their Ne&s;ts in. I could never find out the Rea&s;on of this Extravagance, the An&s;wers of all Per&s;ons of whom I enquir'd, being altogether as extravagant: <HI>'Tis the Cu&s;tom.</HI> The <HI>Georgians</HI> however are fully per&s;waded, that whatever Sins they have committed, they &s;hall obtain Pardon by building a little Church. Though for my part I am apt to believe they build 'em in &s;uch remote and inacce&s;|&s;ible Places, to avoid the Charges of Adorning and Repairing of 'em.</P>
<P>And now I come to the Relations and Hi&s;tories of the Con|que&s;t of <HI>Georgia</HI> by the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> which are &s;o numerous, that I &s;hould have been &s;ilent in this particular, if tho&s;e Authors had agreed among them&s;elves, or if I had found they had been rightly inform'd. Briefly therefore, here is that which I have met with in the Stories of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> them&s;elves.</P>
<P><HI>I&s;hmael</HI> the Great, (whom our Hi&s;torians have Sirnam'd the <HI>Sophy)</HI> after he had &s;ubdu'd the Countries that lie to the We&s;t of the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, of <HI>Media</HI> and part of <HI>Armenia,</HI> and that he had expell'd the <HI>Turks</HI> out of all the&s;e Places, made War al&s;o upon the <HI>Georgians,</HI> though they had &s;ent him numerous Succors at the beginning of his Reign. The event of which War was &s;ucce&s;sful to him, as having reduc'd 'em to pay him Tri|bute, and give him Ho&s;tages. Now <HI>Georgia,</HI> as well as the Kingdoms of <HI>Kaket</HI> and <HI>Carthuel,</HI> had &s;everal Petty Kings, call'd <HI>Eri&s;tares</HI> Feudataries, and always at Wars one with another. Which was the Rea&s;on, or at lea&s;t the Means that mo&s;t contributed to the Ruine of the <HI>Georgians.</HI> They pay'd their Tribute during all the Reign of <HI>I&s;hmael,</HI> and his Succe&s;&s;or <HI>Tahmas,</HI> who was a Prince of great Courage, and fortunate in War. During his Reign <HI>Lnarzab</HI> rul'd in that part of <HI>Ge|orgia</HI> which is call'd <HI>Carthuel,</HI> and is as I have &s;aid the Ea&s;tern <HI>Georgia,</HI> and borders upon <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> Ea&s;tward. This

King le&s;t two Sons behind him, between whom he divided his Kingdom; <HI>Simon</HI> the Elde&s;t, and <HI>David</HI> the Younger. But being both ill &s;atisfi'd with their Divi&s;ion, they made War one upon another, and in tho&s;e Wars both de&s;ir'd <HI>Tahmas</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t 'em. The Younger Brother was beforehand with <HI>Simon.</HI> To whom <HI>Tahmas</HI> return'd for an&s;wer, That he would put him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all his Fathers Dominions, if he would turn <HI>Mahometan. David</HI> accepted the Condition, embrac'd the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Religion, and went and &s;urrender'd him&s;elf to the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Army, which was already enter'd his Dominions, to the Number of Thirty Thou&s;and Hor&s;e; upon which he was pre&s;ently &s;ent to <HI>Tahmas,</HI> who lay then at <HI>Casbin.</HI> So &s;oon as he had got the <HI>Georgian</HI> Prince in his Clutches, he wrote to <HI>Simon</HI> to the &s;ame effect as he had written to his Bro|ther, that is to &s;ay, That he &s;hould quit his Religion, and come to him, if he intended to enjoy the Kingdom of his An|ce&s;tors.</P>
<P><HI>Simon,</HI> finding the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Army pre&s;&s;ing too &s;everely upon him, &s;urrender'd his Per&s;on, but would not abjure his Religi|on. But <HI>Tahmas,</HI> being now Ma&s;ter of both the Princes, and of the Country of <HI>Georgia,</HI> &s;ent the Elde&s;t Brother Pris'|ner to the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Gengh&egrave;</HI> near the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea; and made the other Governour of <HI>Georgia,</HI> changing his Name from <HI>Da|vid</HI> to <HI>Daoud-Can,</HI> which denoted him to be of the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Profe&s;&s;ion. Which done, he took an Oath of Fidelity from all the chief <HI>Georgian</HI> Lords, and carry'd away their Childern and <HI>David</HI>'s al&s;o as Ho&s;tages into <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>After the Death of <HI>Tahmas,</HI> the <HI>Georgians</HI> &s;hook off the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Yoak, as did al&s;o the mo&s;t part of the Provinces of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and they were at Liberty during the Reign of <HI>I&s;hmael</HI> the <HI>Se|cond,</HI> which did not la&s;t above two Years; and during the fir&s;t four Years of <HI>Mahomet Kodabend&egrave;,</HI> that is, <HI>The Servant of GOD:</HI> who &s;ent an Army into <HI>Georgia</HI> to reduce 'em to Obe|dience. <HI>Daoud Can</HI> fled upon the Approach of the Army. At what time his Brother <HI>Simon,</HI> a Pris'ner as I have already de|clar'd, near the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, laying hold of the Opportunity to re-enter into his Dominions, became a <HI>Mahometan,</HI> and was made <HI>Can</HI> of <HI>Tefflis,</HI> under the Name of <HI>Simon-Can.</HI></P>
<P>During the Reign of <HI>Mahomet Kodabend&egrave;,</HI> dy'd <HI>Alexander</HI> King of <HI>Kaket,</HI> leaving Three Sons and Two Daughters. Of which <HI>David</HI> was the Elde&s;t; a Prince who&s;e Courage and Misfortunes have render'd him renown'd over all the World, under the Name of <HI>Taimuras Can,</HI> which the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> gave him.
<PB N="195" REF="107">
At the time of his Fathers Death he remain'd in <HI>Ho&s;tage</HI> at the Court of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> whither he was carry'd by King <HI>Tahmas</HI> as has been &s;aid. He was bred up with <HI>Abas</HI> the Great, being almo&s;t of the &s;ame Age, with great Magnificence and exact Care, where he had inbib'd the Cu&s;toms and Manners of the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> certainly much better then tho&s;e of the <HI>Georgians.</HI> So &s;oon as his Father was Dead, his Mother, a Beautiful and Prudent Prince&s;s, by the <HI>Georgians</HI> call'd <HI>Ketavana,</HI> but <HI>Ma|riana</HI> in the Hi&s;tories of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> wrote a Letter to <HI>Kodabend&egrave;</HI> to this effect, Sir, <HI>My Husband is Dead, I be&s;eech yee to &s;end me my Son</HI> Taimuras <HI>to Reign in his &s;tead; and withal I &s;end you his Brother for Ho&s;tage in his Room.</HI> Thereupon <HI>Taimuras</HI> was &s;ent back, after he had tak'n the Oath of a Tributary and a Va&s;&s;al.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the Reign of <HI>Abas</HI> the Great, <HI>Simon,</HI> King of <HI>Carthuel</HI> already mention'd ended this Life; leaving the Kingdom to <HI>Luarzab</HI> his Son, then a Child, under the Tuition of his Prime Mini&s;ter, a Per&s;on of great parts, but of a mean Extraction, call'd by the <HI>Georgians Mehrou,</HI> and by the <HI>Per&s;ians, Morad,</HI> who was al&s;o Governor of <HI>Tefflis,</HI> and Go|vern'd the Kingdom almo&s;t with an ab&s;olute Authority. This <HI>Mehrou</HI> had a hand&s;ome Daughter, with whom <HI>Luarzab</HI> was pa&s;&s;ionately in Love, and by whom he was as pa&s;&s;ionately be|lov'd. Nor could the Father, by any means that he could u&s;e, prevent the two Lovers from &s;eeing one another. But one Day having &s;urpriz'd the Prince and her lock'd up in a Room toge|ther, <HI>Sir,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>I be&s;eech yee, do not Di&s;honour neither my Daughter, nor my Hou&s;e. If your Maje&s;ty plea&s;es to Marry her, &s;he is at your &s;ervice: but if not, forbear Privacy with her.</HI> Upon which <HI>Luarzab</HI> &s;wore he would have no other Wife; which Oath when the Prince had &s;worn, he &s;uffer'd her to Live with him as with her Husband. However the Marriage was not celebrated, through the oppo&s;ition of the Queen and the Ladies of the Country, who prote&s;ted they would never &s;ub|mit them&s;elves as Subjects to a Per&s;on of her mean Birth. <HI>Lu|arzab,</HI> no le&s;s glad of this oppo&s;ition, told <HI>Mehrou,</HI> that he could not Marry his Daughter. Now the <HI>Georgians</HI> are very Prone to Revenge; as I have already ob&s;erv'd. Thereupon the King was adviz'd to be before hand with <HI>Mehrou,</HI> and to put him to Death to prevent his Revenge. To which the King con&s;ented; and to that purpo&s;e had contriv'd it &s;o as to make <HI>Mehrou</HI> Drunk, and to kill him at the fir&s;t Banquet the King &s;hould make. Of which contrivance <HI>Mehrou</HI> was advertiz'd,
<PB N="196" REF="108">
at the very Moment it &s;hould have been put in Execution. For he was already half Tip&s;y, when one of the Kings Pages, who was one of his Creatures, as he pre&s;ented him the Cup, and &s;eem'd to Bow to him out of re&s;pect, whi&s;per'd to him: Sir, <HI>You will be Murder'd.</HI> At which he made no &s;emblance of being daunted; but ri&s;ing up, as &s;oon as he had giv'n back the Gla&s;s, and pretending to go out to make VVater (which is no <HI>Indecorum</HI> in that Country, where the Fea&s;ts la&s;t for half a Day together) he ran directly to his Stable, takes a Bonnet and a Coat from one of his Grooms that he fir&s;t met; Bridles one of the be&s;t Hor&s;es in the Stable, Mounts him and away he Rides. And he &s;o order'd his Flight, that not being di&s;cover'd it prov'd &s;ucce&s;sful to his VVi&s;h. Pre&s;ently he got to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> where he threw him&s;elf at the Feet of <HI>Abas</HI> the Great, who was newly return'd a Victor, from <HI>Shirvan</HI> and <HI>Shamaki,</HI> Countries Bordering upon <HI>Georgia</HI> and the <HI>Ca&s;pian Sea.</HI> He declar'd to the King how he had &s;erv'd <HI>Luarzab,</HI> and the De|ceas'd King his Father, and what a recompence he had prepar'd him for his Service; by &s;eeking to deprive him of his Life, after he had deflowr'd his Daughter under the pretence of Mar|riage. And concluding, he told the King, that he was the true Monarch of <HI>Georgia,</HI> and therefore he demanded of his Maje&s;ty Ju&s;tice, and the Re&s;titution of his E&s;tate.</P>
<P>But <HI>Mehrou</HI> had contriv'd a &s;ecurer way then this, to revenge him&s;elf upon <HI>Luarzab,</HI> which was to kindle in the Heart of <HI>Abas</HI> an Affection for <HI>Luarzab</HI>'s Si&s;ter; one of the mo&s;t lovely Per&s;ons in all <HI>Georgia;</HI> who&s;e Beauty has been celebrated by all the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Poets. In&s;omuch that in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> they &s;ing to this Day the Songs that render'd her Beauty renown'd above all the Charming Beauties of her time, containing a plea&s;ant Ro|mance of the Amours between <HI>Her</HI> and <HI>Abas.</HI> Her Name of Bapti&s;m was <HI>Darejan.</HI> But the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Fictions give her the Name of <HI>Pebry. Mehrou</HI> therefore took all opportunities to talk of her to <HI>Abas</HI> with all the Artificial Language he could in|vent, to inflame his de&s;ires. Thereupon <HI>Abas</HI> &s;ent to demand her of <HI>Luarzab</HI> fir&s;t by one Amba&s;&s;ador, and then by another. The fir&s;t was &s;ent back with fair promi&s;es; the &s;econd receiv'd for An&s;wer, that the Prince&s;s had affianc'd her &s;elf to <HI>Taimuras</HI> King of <HI>Kaket,</HI> who was then a VVidower. But <HI>Abas</HI> the more enflam'd by the&s;e refu&s;als, &s;ent a third Amba&s;&s;ador to <HI>Luarzab,</HI> charging him to demand his Si&s;ter with all manner of fair promi&s;es and foul Threats: and he wrote at the &s;ame time to <HI>Taimuras,</HI> not to Marry <HI>Luarzab</HI>'s Si&s;ter, but to come
<PB N="197" REF="108">
and meet him. <HI>Luarzab</HI> on the other &s;ide incens'd at the&s;e repeated and Haughty Importunities, in&s;tead of returning an an&s;wer to the Amba&s;&s;ador, affronted and abus'd him; to the end no more Amba&s;&s;adors might be &s;ent to trouble him any more upon that Errand. <HI>Abas</HI> however was not then in a con|dition to execute his intended de&s;igns upon <HI>Georgia,</HI> as being at War with the <HI>Turks.</HI> He di&s;&s;embl'd therefore his Indigna|tion, and order'd a <HI>Carmelite</HI> Mi&s;&s;ionary, whom he &s;ent into <HI>Europe</HI> to animate the Chri&s;tian Princes to a War again&s;t the <HI>Turk,</HI> to take <HI>Georgia</HI> in his way, and to admoni&s;h <HI>Taimuras</HI> by no means to joyn with the <HI>Turks,</HI> nor to give 'em any man|ner of a&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI> To which <HI>Taimuras</HI> either out of too much Fear or too much Credulity readily conde&s;cended: but he &s;oon repented his forbearance: for in the Year 1613 <HI>Abas</HI> &s;et forward from <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> with a de&s;ign to make War upon <HI>Georgia.</HI> However as he was a Prince, who among his other Extraordinary Endowments was ex|treamly cunning and re&s;erv'd, he manag'd that War like an Amorous Intreague. He gave out that <HI>Luarzab</HI>'s Si&s;ter lov'd him and de&s;ir'd the Match: that &s;he had &s;ent him Letters by a confident of her own; moreover that &s;he had been pro|mis'd him, and therefore that <HI>Luarzab</HI> was both Perfidious and Unju&s;t. In the mean time he made his preparations for &s;ome|thing el&s;e then to fight a Rival: for all Men plainly perceiv'd that he was re&s;olv'd to reduce <HI>Georgia</HI> under his Subjection. He had a great number of <HI>Georgians</HI> in his Army. He gave Pen&s;ions to &s;everal great <HI>Georgian</HI> Lords; and <HI>Mehrou</HI> corrup|ted the Loyalty of &s;everal others every day, who engag'd to take his part: He had two of <HI>Taimuras</HI>'s Sons in Ho&s;tage, and a Brother and Si&s;ter of <HI>Luarzabs.</HI> In a word he wrought with &s;ome of the Princes of the Blood Royal of <HI>Georgia</HI> to turn <HI>Mahometans,</HI> for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of great Employments and Governments. For he thought he &s;hould ea&s;ily compa&s;s his de&s;igns again&s;t the <HI>Georgians,</HI> by &s;owing Divi&s;ions among 'em; an ea&s;ie thing to do, e&s;pecially among People that are given to revenge. He wrote to <HI>Taimuras</HI> that <HI>Luarzab</HI> was ungrateful, a Rebel, a Mad-Man, not fit to Reign, and that he was re&s;olv'd to deprive him of his Crown. To <HI>Luarzab</HI> he wrote the &s;ame thing concerning <HI>Taimuras;</HI> and at the &s;ame time order'd <HI>Lolla Beg,</HI> General of his Army, who lay toward <HI>Media,</HI> to enter <HI>Georgia</HI> with Thirty Thou&s;and Hor&s;e, and to put all to Fire and Sword.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="109">
Upon this, <HI>Luarzab</HI> and <HI>Taimuras</HI> were coun&s;ell'd to unite. They met, and communicated to each other <HI>Abas</HI>'s Letters: wherein finding the ruin of both re&s;olv'd upon, they &s;wore one to another either to Peri&s;h, or re&s;cue each other from the danger; and the more to confirm and &s;trengthen their Union, <HI>Luarzab</HI> gave his Si&s;ter, the Incomparable <HI>Darejan</HI> to <HI>Tai|muras. Abas</HI> was like to run Mad when they brought him the News; he was ready to have Cut the Throats of <HI>Taimu|ras</HI>'s Two Sons with his own Hands, and of the other <HI>Geor|gian</HI> Ho&s;tages: nothing would &s;erve him but he &s;wore the Death of all together. But at length he kept him&s;elf within bounds, and minded only to ha&s;ten his march rather to puni&s;h the Kings that had offended him.</P>
<P><HI>Taimuras,</HI> &s;en&s;ible of the approach of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Army, would have prepar'd for his defence. But he di&s;cover'd that a part of the Grandees of his Kingdom were inclin'd to Sur|render. Thereupon he &s;ent his Mother to <HI>Abas.</HI> She was a Prince&s;s that had betak'n her &s;elf to a Religious Life, &s;o &s;oon as her Misfortune had made her a Widow. Not that they make any Vows, or quit their u&s;ual Habitations, but only put on the Religious Habit, who in tho&s;e Countries make profe&s;|&s;ion of a Religious Life, as I have already ob&s;erv'd in my Re|lation of the <HI>Mingrelian</HI> Religion, which is the &s;ame with that of the <HI>Georgians. Mariana</HI> or <HI>Ketavana</HI> therefore (for &s;he was call'd by both the&s;e Names) wore the Habit of a Religious Per&s;on, to the end &s;he might have an excu&s;e to Live more re|tir'd, and uninterrupted in her Devotions.

<P>This Prince&s;s was at that time well advanc'd in Years, yet was &s;he &s;till a Lovely Lady, &s;o that <HI>Abas</HI> became enamour'd of her, or at lea&s;t feign'd to be &s;o, the fir&s;t day he &s;aw her: thereupon he courted her to turn <HI>Mahumetan,</HI> that he might be in a Condition to Marry her. But the Prince&s;s more Wed|ded to her Cha&s;tity and Religion, and perhaps not enduring the &s;trict Confinement of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Queens, refus'd the Kings Offers with a Vertue and Con&s;tancy unmoveable, which was to be admir'd in a <HI>Georgian.

Ketavana</HI> remain'd in Pri&s;on &s;everal Years, and was afterwards remanded to <HI>Shiras,</HI> where &s;he &s;uffer'd a mo&s;t cruel Martyr|dom, in the Year 1624. a good while after <HI>Abas</HI> had Con|quer'd <HI>Georgia.</HI> For then it was that he wrote to <HI>Iman-Kooli-Kan,</HI> Governour of that City, to force <HI>Ketavana</HI> to turn <HI>Ma|humetan,</HI> whatever it co&s;t him; and to make u&s;e of Torments, if Promi&s;es, Threats, and Blows would not prevail. <HI>Iman-Kooli-Kan</HI> &s;hew'd his Orders to the Prince&s;s, in hopes that that would take effect: but it &s;ignifi'd nothing. Nor were all their Torments more prevalent upon a Soul &s;o truly Heroick and Devour.

<P>But to return to the <HI>Georgian</HI> War, <HI>Abas</HI> being enter'd into the Country of <HI>Georgia</HI> with his Army, guided by <HI>Mehrou,</HI> and reinforc'd with a great Number of <HI>Georgians</HI> every day; Hopes and Promi&s;es inveagling &s;ome, and fear or de&s;ire of Revenge attracting others, <HI>Luarzab</HI> re&s;olv'd however to fight it out, hoping &s;o to &s;hut up the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> in the Woods, that he might ea&s;ily there defeat 'em. And indeed <HI>Abas</HI> at one time gave him&s;elf over for lo&s;t, and thought he had been betray'd. For being advanc'd with his Army Five and Twenty Leagues into the Country, <HI>Luarzab</HI> divided his Forces into two parts, and &s;hut up the Pa&s;&s;ages by felling an infinite Number of Wood, &s;o that the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Army could neither advance nor retreat. <HI>Abas</HI> was in a &s;trange Con&s;ternation, &s;o that <HI>Mehrou</HI> fearing the lo&s;s of his Head, as a Traytor, <HI>&V;pon my Life, Sir,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>I will bring ye out of the&s;e Streights in three Days.</HI> And he was as good as his word. For he open'd a Cro&s;s-way through the Wood by means of his Infantry, and leaving the Camp which was block'd up by the <HI>Georgians,</HI> took only the Cavalry along with him. Neverthele&s;s <HI>Abas</HI> would lead 'em him&s;elf,

and having pa&s;s'd the Wood, fell into the Kingdom of <HI>Kaket,</HI> committing great Cruelty and Spoil; in&s;omuch that he com|manded all the Trees that breed the Silkworms to be de|&s;troy'd; on purpo&s;e to ruine pa&s;t recovery a Country that chiefly &s;ub&s;i&s;ts by making of Silk. When the&s;e Mournful Tidings were brought to <HI>Luarzab,</HI> he gave him&s;elf over for lo&s;t, and fled into <HI>Mingrelia.</HI> On the other &s;ide, <HI>Abas</HI> who knew his Conque&s;ts were not &s;ecure, &s;o long as the <HI>Georgian</HI> Kings were at Liberty, wrote to <HI>Luarzab</HI> in the&s;e Terms: <HI>What Rea&s;on urges you to flie? Tis</HI> Taimuras <HI>that I &s;eek, that In|grateful and Perfidious Rebel.

<P>Thereupon <HI>Luarzab</HI> in tender pity of his People, &s;urren|der'd him&s;elf to <HI>Abas.</HI> The King receiv'd him in mo&s;t friendly manner, and with a Thou&s;and Care&s;&s;es, replac'd him upon the Throne with all the Pomp and Solemnity imaginable; which was done the better to deceive the <HI>Georgians,</HI> and to make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of the Country without &s;triking a Stroak. He al&s;o made him &s;everal co&s;tly Pre&s;ents, and among the re&s;t, he gave him a Heron-Tuft of Precious Stones, which he com|manded him always to wear, e&s;pecially when he came into his Pre&s;ence. <HI>This is an En&s;ign of Royalty</HI> &s;aid he <HI>and it is my plea&s;ure you &s;hould always wear it upon your Head, that People may know yee to be King.</HI> Now the &s;ame Day that <HI>Abas</HI> was to &s;et forward for <HI>Tefflis,</HI> &s;aid he to <HI>Luarzab, I &s;hall make a halt &s;ix Leagues from this place, and &s;end away the re&s;t of the Army; will not you bear me Company thither?</HI> This was a Snare with fair words to draw the poor <HI>Georgian</HI> King from his Capital City: and he was as ea&s;ily deluded to go along with him, in regard he mi&s;tru&s;ted not the lea&s;t fowl play. In the mean while <HI>Abas</HI> commanded one of his Guards, a noted Pick-Pocket, and one of the mo&s;t dextrous i' the World at his Pro|fe&s;&s;ion, to &s;teal <HI>Luarzab</HI>'s <HI>Heron-Tuft</HI> from him.

Pre|&s;ently therefore he was laid hold on; but <HI>Abas</HI> dur&s;t not put him to death for fear of a Revolt in <HI>Georgia.</HI> He &s;ent him therefore into <HI>Ma&s;anderan,</HI> or <HI>Hyrcania,</HI> hoping that the bad Air of the Country would kill him: but &s;eeing that would not do, he remov'd him to <HI>Shiras;</HI> and at length took the following occa&s;ion to put him to death.</P>
<P>The Grand Duke of <HI>Mo&s;covy</HI> had been a long time &s;ollici|ted by the <HI>Georgian</HI> Princes to intercede in his behalf to <HI>Abas.</HI> Who was therefore at the Charge of a Co&s;tly Emba&s;&s;ie meer|ly for that purpo&s;e. Thereupon <HI>Abas,</HI> who was a Per&s;on of a quick Wit, and never idle, gave order to the Governour of <HI>Shamaki,</HI> a City upon the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, where the Amba&s;&s;a|dors of <HI>Mo&s;covy</HI> fir&s;t enter into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> to try what he could do to di&s;cover whether the Amba&s;&s;ador came only upon <HI>Luarzab</HI>'s account or no: and whether the <HI>Mo&s;covite</HI> did take his part to that degree that there was any likelyhood of a Rupture. To which the Governour &s;ent word, That the Amba&s;&s;ador came only to &s;erve <HI>Luarzab;</HI> that he was a very great Lord, and that his In&s;tructions were very po&s;itive for a punctual An|&s;wer. Upon which <HI>Abas,</HI> who was re&s;olv'd not to relea&s;e the <HI>Georgian</HI> Prince, nor yet could refu&s;e him his Liberty at the reque&s;t of the Duke of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> wrote to the Governour of <HI>Shiras</HI> to rid <HI>Luarzab</HI> out of the World, &s;o that his Death might &s;eem only to have happen'd by accident. Which was accompli&s;h'd to his de&s;ire, and the News was brought to <HI>Abas,</HI> two Days before the Arrival of the <HI>Mo&s;covite</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador. <HI>Abas</HI> made the Courier tell his Tale in publick, at what time he &s;eem'd to be &s;trangely troubl'd and &s;urpriz'd: <HI>Good GOD,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>this is &V;nfortunate News indeed; How came he by his Death?

<P>Soon after the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador had his Audience; at what time, after the Banquet was over, and that they had drank pretty hard, the King &s;ending for him near to his own Per&s;on <HI>Well,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>Mr. Amba&s;&s;ador, and what is't the King of the</HI> Ru&s;&s;es <HI>my Brother de&s;ires of me?</HI> Thereupon the Am|ba&s;&s;ador began to unfold his Commi&s;&s;ion, and declare the Purport of his Emba&s;&s;ie; but when he had once let &s;lip <HI>Luar|zab</HI>'s

<P>Thereupon the Brother of <HI>Luarzab</HI> was made Governour of <HI>Georgia</HI> in his Room, being turn'd <HI>Mahumetan</HI> before that: and call'd by a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Title joyn'd to his <HI>Georgian, Bacrat-Mirzah,</HI> or the <HI>Royal Prince.

All which time &s;he &s;hew'd her &s;elf every Day to the Comman|der's Wives; and then &s;ending for him to her Apartiment, &s;he told him that upon the credit of his Wives, that had &s;een her, he might write to the King, that &s;he was no &s;uch Amia|ble Beauty to be &s;o ardently de&s;ir'd, that &s;he was far gone in Years, and be&s;ides that &s;he was a little mis&s;hapen; and there|fore that &s;he conjur'd his Maje&s;ty to let her end her Days in her own Country.

And &s;o &s;oon as &s;he had &s;ent her pre&s;ent, &s;he retir'd from the World, not &s;uffering her &s;elf to be &s;een by any Body, &s;he betook her &s;elf wholly to her Devoti|ons, giving great Alms to the Poor, to the end they might Pray to GOD for her Souls Health.

At which when <HI>Shanavas-Can</HI> &s;eem'd to be Jealous, the Prince&s;s fell a laughing at him; and ask'd Whether he were not a&s;ham'd to be Jealous of a poor, old, blind, mi&s;erable Creature, and altogether as impotent as him|&s;elf.</P>

<P>A <HI>Georgian</HI> Lord had giv'n the King to under&s;tand, that he had a Niece of an extraordinary Beauty.

Thereupon he came to his Si&s;ter, who was a Widow, and told her, That the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> had a de&s;ire to Marry her Daughter, and that therefore &s;he mu&s;t per|&s;wade her to give her con&s;ent. Thereupon the Mother ha|ving made known to the Young Virgin, the force that was upon her, &s;he was almo&s;t at her Wits end.

Thereupon they took a Re&s;olution to make him a Sharer in their Misfortune, and to that purpo&s;e &s;ent him the News by one of their Dome&s;tick Ser|vants. Away comes the Lord Po&s;t, and arriving at Midnight, found the Mother and the Daughter with mutual Tears and a condolling Grief bewailing their hard Fortune. Pre&s;ently the Lord threw him&s;elf at their Feet, and told 'em, That for his part he fear'd nothing &s;o much as the lo&s;s of his Mi&s;tre&s;s, and that all the Anger of the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> was nothing to him in re&s;pect of &s;uch a fatal Calamity.

<P>The fear which they have in <HI>Georgia</HI> of Accidents of the like Nature, obliges tho&s;e that have hand&s;om Daughters to Marry 'em as &s;oon as they can, and &s;ometimes in their Infan|cy. The poor People Marry theirs betimes, and &s;ometimes in the very Cradle. To the end the Lords who&s;e Va&s;&s;als they are, &s;hould not take 'em away by force, either to &s;ell 'em, or make 'em their Concubines. For certain it is, they have a very great re&s;pect for Marry'd Per&s;ons; and though they are but Children, they are not ea&s;ily induc'd to tear 'em out of their Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>The Kingdom of <HI>Caket</HI> is at pre&s;ent in Subjection to the King of <HI>Per&s;ia; Shanavas-Can</HI> having compleated the Conque&s;t of it; and now <HI>Archilus</HI> his Son is Viceroy, who turn'd <HI>Maho|metan</HI> to obtain the Imployment. We have already made mention of him, and of the Love which he had for <HI>Si&s;tan-Darejan</HI> the King of <HI>Imiretta</HI>'s Wife, when we gave an Ac|count of the Revolutions of that Petty Kingdom. <HI>Si&s;tan-Darejan</HI> remain'd a Pris'ner at <HI>Akalzik&egrave;,</HI> where the Ba&s;ha's &s;hew'd her an extraordinary Civility. <HI>Archilus</HI> had al&s;o a longing Affection for her, from the time that he had lo&s;t &s;ight of her. Thereupon his Father &s;o wrought by his Pre&s;ents and Contrivances with the <HI>Ba&s;ha,</HI> that he releas'd her in the Year 1660. She was carry'd in Triumph to <HI>Tefflis,</HI> where <HI>Archilus</HI> Marry'd her immediately, and by that Match entitl'd him&s;elf to the Kingdom of <HI>Caket,</HI> of which he was actual Viceroy al|ready. For the Prince&s;s his Wife was Daughter to <HI>Taimuras-Can,</HI> and Si&s;ter of <HI>Heraclius,</HI> the only Son whom that Unfor|tunate Prince left behind him capable of Succe&s;&s;ion, in regard all the re&s;t had had their Eyes put out. But he and his Mother were fled into <HI>Mo&s;covy;</HI> where they &s;ay, the Great Duke al|lows 'em a Train &s;uitable to their Quality. And here give me
<PB N="207" REF="113">
leave to tell yee one Pa&s;&s;age concerning this <HI>Archilus</HI> Viceroy of <HI>Caket,</HI> very much worthy to entertain your Curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>He was affianc'd in his Youth, to a Daughter of one of the mo&s;t Noble Families in <HI>Georgia.</HI> And the Lady fully expected to be his Wife, in regard that Breach of Contract is a thing never heard of in that Country. But when &s;he heard that he had Marry'd <HI>Si&s;tan-Darejan,</HI> &s;he &s;ent to him to demand &s;atis|faction, <HI>for the Murder he had committed upon her Honour.</HI> For &s;o in <HI>Georgia</HI> they call the affront done to a Contract, when a Man leaves the party affianc'd to Marry another. At fir&s;t &s;he re&s;olv'd to Sue him at Law for the Inju&s;tice he had done her; but that way not &s;eeming fea&s;able, by rea&s;on of the great Authority and Sway which <HI>Archilus</HI> had in the Country, &s;he put her &s;elf at the Head of Four Hunderd Men, and of|fer'd fairly to fight her Faithle&s;s Lover. But <HI>Archilus</HI> refus'd her, &s;ending her word he did not u&s;e to fight with Young Maids: withal he bid her not make &s;uch a noi&s;e, le&s;t he di&s;clos'd the Favours which <HI>Sizi</HI> a Young Lord at Court had boa&s;ted to have receiv'd from her. The Young Lady enrag'd to hear her &s;elf reproach'd as well as &s;corn'd, turn'd all her fury again&s;t <HI>Sizi.</HI> She challeng'd him, and becau&s;e he would not meet her; &s;he lay'd her &s;elf in Ambu&s;h for him, put him to flight, pur&s;u'd him and kill'd him above Twenty Men. She had al&s;o a Brother; and he al&s;o undertook to quarrel <HI>Sizi.</HI> The Prince and the the whole Court did all they could to reconcile 'em: but &s;ee|ing they did but labour in Vain, the two Adver&s;aries were permitted to determine the difference by their Swords. Now it is the cu&s;tom in <HI>Georgia,</HI> that when the Law cannot decide or reconcile a Quarrel among Gentlemen, they are permitted to try it out in a place Rayl'd in for the purpo&s;e. And before the two Combatants enter the Li&s;ts, they Confe&s;s them&s;elves, receive the Communion, and prepare for Death. This is call'd, <HI>Appealing to the Tribunal of GOD,</HI> for the <HI>Georgians</HI> maintain that this way of referring directly to GOD the Pu|ni&s;hment of a Crime, is both Hone&s;t and Lawful; where human Ju&s;tice is not able to di&s;tingui&s;h whether the party ac|cus'd be Guilty, or whether the accu&s;er charge him fal&s;ely. At length <HI>Sizi</HI> and his Adver&s;ary being arriv'd at the place ap|pointed, they were parted by a Company of Souldiers, ju&s;t as they had drawn their Swords. And the Young Lady Dying &s;oon after with &s;hame and Grief; the Prince by his Authority oblig'd her Brother to be Friends with <HI>Archilus</HI> and <HI>Sizi.</HI></P>

And now before I relate what befell me at <HI>Tefflis,</HI> it behoves me to make a De&s;cription of the Place; though the Plate before the Leaf, might &s;uffice to give a di&s;tinct Idea of it.</P>
<P>This City is one of the faire&s;t in all <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> though it be not &s;o very big. It is &s;eated at the bottom of a Mountain, at the Foot of which upon the Ea&s;tern &s;ide, runs the <HI>River Cur:</HI> Which River, being the Ancient <HI>Cyrus,</HI> or an Arm of that <HI>Cyrus,</HI> has its &s;ource in the Mountains of <HI>Georgia,</HI> and joyns to <HI>Araxes.</HI> The mo&s;t part of the Hou&s;es built by the River &s;ide &s;tand upon a hard Stony Rock. The City is encompa&s;s'd with very Strong and Beautiful Walls, only on that &s;ide next the River. It lyes all in length from the North to the South, defended by a large Fortre&s;s on the South &s;ide &s;eated upon the brow of a Mountain, wherein there are none but Native <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> whether Inhabitants or Souldiers. The Parading Place that is before it, &s;erves al&s;o for a publick meeting Place and Market. This Fortre&s;s is likewi&s;e a Sanctuary of Refuge: All manner of Criminals and People in Debt are there &s;afe. The Prince of <HI>Georgia</HI> is oblig'd to pa&s;s through the mid&s;t of it, when he goes according to cu&s;tom to receive without the Gates of the City, the Kings Pre&s;ents and Letters; for that when you come from <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> to <HI>Tefflis,</HI> there's no entring into the City but through the Fortre&s;s. Yet mo&s;t certain it is, that the Prince never goes through the Ca&s;tle, but he is afraid of being arre&s;ted, and lea&s;t the Governor &s;hould have &s;ome &s;ecret order to &s;eize upon his Per&s;on. And indeed the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Kings have very prudently e&s;tabli&s;h'd a cu&s;tom among the <HI>Viceroys</HI> of <HI>Georgia,</HI> and the re&s;t of the Governors of the Provinces of the Empire, that they are oblig'd to go and receive whatever the King &s;ends 'em without the Gates of the City; by which means he may without any trouble or hazard &s;eize upon their Per&s;ons. <HI>Tefflis</HI> contains &s;everal Churches; to the Number as they &s;ay of Fourteen; which is much in a Country where there is &s;o little Devotion. Six are maintain'd and appropriated to the <HI>Geor|gian</HI> Service: The other belong to the <HI>Armenians.</HI> The Ca|thedral, which is call'd <HI>Sion,</HI> is &s;eated upon the Bank of the River, built all of fair hewn Stone. 'Tis an Ancient Building well in repair, like all the Ancient Churches in the Ea&s;t; which are compos'd of Four Bodies, the middle of which is a great <HI>Duomo,</HI> &s;u&s;tain'd by Four Great Pila&s;ters, and cover'd with a Steeple. The Great Altar is in the Middle of the Body that lyes to the Ea&s;t. The In&s;ide of the Church is full of flat

Paintings after the <HI>Greek</HI> manner, painted but a while ago, and by &s;uch leud Arti&s;ts, that it is the greate&s;t trouble in the World to know what they mean. The Bi&s;hop's See adjoyns to the Church, where the <HI>Tibilele</HI> re&s;ides: For by that Name they alway call the Bi&s;hops of <HI>Tefflis.</HI> Next to the Cathedral the Principal Churches of <HI>Georgia</HI> are <HI>Tetrachen,</HI> or the <HI>White-Work,</HI> which was built by the Prince&s;s <HI>Mary:</HI> and <HI>Angue&s;cat,</HI> or the Image of <HI>Abagare.</HI> The <HI>Georgians</HI> call <HI>Abagare Angues,</HI> and hold that the Miraculous Portraicture which they a&s;&s;ure us he receiv'd from Je&s;us Chri&s;t, has been a long time in that Church. They al&s;o call it the <HI>Catholicos</HI>'s Church, becau&s;e that Prelate's Palace joyns to it: and that he &s;eldom goes other where to &s;ay his Prayers, or Officiate. This Church is &s;eated upon the Bank of the River, directly parallel with the Bi&s;hop's See. The <HI>Georgians</HI> al&s;o had one more very fair Church at the end of the City upon the South-&s;ide: but the Prince made u&s;e of it &s;ome years for a Storehou&s;e for his Powder. And indeed it was fit for nothing el&s;e, for long before that, the Thunder had thrown down a good part of it. Thereupon the Prince caus'd it to be repair'd; and this <HI>Magazin</HI> &s;till carries the Name of the Church of <HI>Melete,</HI> that is to &s;ay, <HI>The Rupture.</HI> Which Name was given to it, by rea&s;on that it was founded by one of the Kings of <HI>Georgia,</HI> to &s;hew his Repentance, for that he had without any occa&s;ion giv'n him, broken a Peace with one of his Neighbour Princes.</P>
<P>The Principal Mona&s;teries that belong to the <HI>Armenians,</HI> are <HI>Pacha-Vane,</HI> that is, the <HI>Mona&s;tery</HI> of <HI>Pacha:</HI> in which Mo|na&s;tery, the <HI>Armenian</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Tefflis</HI> re&s;ides. They &s;o call it by the Report of the <HI>Armenians,</HI> for that a Fugitive <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of <HI>Turkey</HI> turning Chri&s;tian, caus'd it to be erected in this City. <HI>Sourph-Ni&s;hon,</HI> that is, to &s;peak properly, the <HI>Red Sign;</HI> and thence generally tak'n for the Holy Cro&s;s. <HI>Bethem,</HI> or <HI>Bethlehem, Norachen,</HI> or the <HI>New Work</HI> and <HI>Mognay.</HI> Now <HI>Mognay</HI> is the Name of a Village of the <HI>Armenians</HI> near <HI>Irivan,</HI> where they have for a long time kept a certain Skull, which they a&s;&s;ure yee to be St. <HI>George</HI>'s: hence becau&s;e that part of the Skull is remov'd to this Church, therefore they gave it the Name of the Place from whence they took the Relick.</P>
<P>There is not any <HI>Mo&s;que</HI> at <HI>Tefflis,</HI> though the City belongs to a <HI>Mahometan</HI> Empire: and is Govern'd together with the whole Province by a <HI>Mahometan</HI> Prince. The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> have endeavour'd all they could to rebuild one there, but never could accompli&s;h their de&s;ign; for the People &s;till Mutiny'd,

and by force of Arms beat down the Work, and abus'd the Workmen. And indeed the <HI>Georgian Princes</HI> were glad of the&s;e Seditions of the People, though they would not counte|nance 'em openly: For in regard they had not renounced the Chri&s;tian Religion but only with their Lips, and to obtain Pre|ferment, they could not heartily con&s;ent to the E&s;tabli&s;hment of <HI>Mahometi&s;m.</HI> Now the <HI>Georgians</HI> are Mutinous, Incon&s;tant and Valiant, as has been &s;aid: They al&s;o retain a &s;mack and &s;en&s;e of Liberty. Then they lie near the <HI>Turks.</HI> And this is that which hinders the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> from making u&s;e of Extremi|ties, and pre&s;erves to the City of <HI>Tefflis</HI> and all <HI>Georgia</HI> a hap|py Liberty to retain almo&s;t all the Exteriour Marks of their Religion. Upon all the Steeples of their Churches at the Top &s;tands a Cro&s;s; and they are furni&s;h'd with &s;everal Bells which they ring. Every day they &s;ell <HI>Pork</HI> openly, and in publick with the &s;ame freedom as other Vittles, and Wine at the Cor|ners of the Streets. All which though the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> are mad to &s;ee, yet they know not how to help it.</P>
<P>Some few Years &s;ince they built a &s;mall <HI>Mo&s;que</HI> in the Fortre&s;s, clo&s;e to the Wall that &s;eparates it from the Grand <HI>Piazza</HI> of <HI>Tefflis.</HI> They built it in the Ca&s;tle to accu&s;tom the People to the &s;ight of <HI>Mo&s;ques,</HI> and of the Prie&s;ts, that call the <HI>Ma|hometans</HI> to Prayer from the Top of the Building. Nor could the <HI>Georgians</HI> hinder the Building of this <HI>Mo&s;que,</HI> becau&s;e they dur&s;t not enter Arm'd into the Fortre&s;s, where there was al|ways a good Guard: But &s;o &s;oon as the Prie&s;t was mounted to the Top to make Confe&s;&s;ion of his Faith, the People ga|ther'd together into the <HI>Piazza,</HI> and ply'd the Top of the Mo&s;que with &s;uch Volleys of Stones, that the Prie&s;t was con|&s;train'd to come down again in more ha&s;te then he went up: after which Mutiny, the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> would never &s;uffer any of their <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> to appear at the Top of the Mo&s;que any more.</P>
<P>The publick Buildings at <HI>Tefflis</HI> are very graceful: Their <HI>Bazars,</HI> or Market-places are very large, built of Stone, and in very good repair. The <HI>Inns,</HI> or <HI>Caravan&s;era</HI>'s for the Re|ceipt and Entertainment of Strangers, are no le&s;s beautiful. There are few Baths indeed in the City, by rea&s;on that every Body goes to the Hot-Baths that are in the Ca&s;tle. The Water of which Baths &s;prings from a Sulphur-Mine, and is very hot. So that the People which make u&s;e of 'em for Di&s;ea&s;es and Di|&s;tempers are no le&s;s numerous then tho&s;e that go for Clean|line&s;s and Curio&s;ity. The Magazins al&s;o are well built, and

kept in Order, being &s;eated in an open place near the Grand <HI>Piazza.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Prince</HI>'s <HI>Palace</HI> is without contradiction one of the mo&s;t beautiful Ornaments in <HI>Tefflis;</HI> being adorn'd with &s;pacious Halls and Rooms of State that look out upon the River, and the Gardens which are very large. It al&s;o contains &s;everal Aviaries, full of Birds of &s;everal &s;orts, a &s;pacious Dog-kennel, and the mo&s;t lovely place to keep Hawks in that Eyes ever beheld. Before the <HI>Palace</HI> lies a &s;pacious Court &s;ufficient to hold a Thou&s;and Hor&s;e; which is &s;urrounded with Shops, and joyns to a long Bazar right again&s;t the <HI>Palace-Gate.</HI> So that it is a lovely <HI>Pro&s;pect</HI> which the <HI>Piazza</HI> and the Front of the <HI>Palace</HI> makes from the Top of the Bazar. Moreover, the Viceroy of <HI>Caket</HI> has a <HI>Palace</HI> at the end of the City; which de&s;erves to be well view'd and con&s;ider'd.</P>
<P>The Out-parts of <HI>Tefflis</HI> are adorn'd with &s;everal Hou&s;es of Plea&s;ure, and &s;everal beautiful Gardens. The bigge&s;t of which is the Prince's; where indeed there are but few Fruit-Trees; but it is full of tho&s;e that &s;erve for the Ornament of Gardens, and for Shade and Coolne&s;s.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o a Habitation of Mi&s;&s;ionary Capuchins at <HI>Tef|flis,</HI> where the Superiour of the Mi&s;&s;ions which that Order has, and hopes to have in <HI>Georgia,</HI> re&s;ides; it being about Thirteen Years ago &s;ince they were &s;ent from <HI>Rome.</HI> The Title of Phy|&s;icians which they give them&s;elves, and which every Body there gives 'em, is the rea&s;on that they are well receiv'd where|ever they de&s;ire to &s;ettle. For <HI>Phy&s;ick,</HI> and e&s;pecially <HI>Chymi&s;try,</HI> which is very much e&s;teem'd, is little known in the Ea&s;tern Counties. They &s;ettl'd fir&s;t at <HI>Tefflis,</HI> and afterwards at <HI>Gory. Shanavas-Can</HI> gave 'em a Hou&s;e in each of tho&s;e Cities with free Liberty to exerci&s;e their Religion. They brought him Letters from the <HI>Pope,</HI> and the Congregation <HI>de Propaganda Fide,</HI> and in their own Names made Noble <HI>Pre&s;ents</HI> to him|&s;elf, the <HI>Prince&s;s,</HI> the <HI>Catholicos,</HI> and the principal Grandees of the Court, which they continue to do at the end of every two Years. Whoever among 'em under&s;tands <HI>Phy&s;ick</HI> be&s;t, never &s;tirs from the <HI>Per&s;on</HI> of the <HI>Prince</HI> to pre&s;erve his <HI>Protection,</HI> which is their only Safeguard from the Per&s;ecutions of the <HI>Georgian</HI> and <HI>Armenian</HI> Clergy. They have endeavour'd to expel the&s;e Mi&s;&s;ionaries from time to time, as they &s;aw their Endeavours to draw People to their Religion; but in regard there are neither <HI>Phy&s;icians</HI> nor <HI>Surgeons</HI> in <HI>Georgia,</HI> they make them&s;elves nece&s;&s;ary by the practi&s;e of <HI>Phy&s;ick</HI> and <HI>Surgery,</HI>
<PB N="212" REF="119">
which &s;ome of 'em under&s;tand very well, and practi&s;e with very good &s;ucce&s;s. They have permi&s;&s;ion from the <HI>Pope</HI> to take Money for their Cures, and they make good advantage of it, <HI>Phy&s;ick</HI> being their chiefe&s;t Sub&s;i&s;tence: They are gene|rally paid in Wine, Meal, Cattel, and young Slaves; and &s;ome there are that give 'em Hor&s;es: of all which they &s;ell whatever they have no need of, or whatever they have to &s;pare. Were it not for this &s;upport of <HI>Phy&s;ick,</HI> they could never &s;ub|&s;i&s;t upon the Annual Pen&s;ion which the <HI>Congregation</HI> allows 'em of 18 <HI>Roman</HI> Crowns for every Mi&s;&s;ionary, which make but Five Pounds Ten Shillings. Be&s;ides the Di&s;pen&s;ation al|ready mention'd, the&s;e Mi&s;&s;ionaries have &s;everal others both in Spirituals and Temporals; as, to &s;ay Ma&s;s, without any Body to a&s;&s;i&s;t at it, to &s;ay it in &s;everal &s;orts of places, and in all &s;orts of Habits, to give Ab&s;olution of all manner of Sins, to di&s;gui&s;e them&s;elves, to keep Hor&s;es and Servants, to have Slaves, to buy and &s;ell, to pay and take Intere&s;t. In a word, they have Di&s;pen&s;ations &s;o ample, and of that extent, that they pretend a power to do, and do in effect, whatever is permit|ted to the mo&s;t priviledg'd Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks. Neverthele&s;s the&s;e Mi&s;&s;ionaries, with all their Artifices, and notwith&s;tanding all this Liberty, make very little progre&s;s among the <HI>Georgians.</HI> For be&s;ides that the people are very ignorant, and take little care to in&s;truct them&s;elves, it is &s;o rivetted into their Heads, that Fa&s;ting as they ob&s;erve it, is the E&s;&s;ential part of Chri&s;ti|an Religion: That they do not believe the <HI>Capuchins</HI> to be <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> becau&s;e they are inform'd that in <HI>Europe</HI> they do not fa&s;t as they do. This incredible Ob&s;tinacy obliges the <HI>Ca|puchins</HI> to fa&s;t as they do, and to ab&s;tain from Creatures which the <HI>Georgians</HI> abhor, as the Hare, the Tortoi&s;e, and others. They fa&s;t <HI>Wedne&s;days</HI> and <HI>Frydays,</HI> regulating them&s;elves ac|cording to the Ancient Calendar, that they may be &s;aid to be outwardly no more then <HI>Georgian Chri&s;tians.</HI> Many People at fir&s;t repair'd to their Church at <HI>Tefflis,</HI> drawn thither by the Novelty of their Service, and a little Mu&s;ick of four or five Voices, accompany'd with a Lute, and a Spinet. But at pre&s;ent there go no more then only five or &s;ix poor People, who get &s;omething by the Mi&s;&s;ionaries. They have al&s;o &s;et up a School, but they have not above &s;even or eight Scholars, the Children of poor Parents, who go thither more for Vittles then Learning, as the Fathers confe&s;s'd them&s;elves. They told me often that they did not keep up their Mi&s;&s;ions for any pro|fit they got by 'em, but only for the Honour of the <HI>Roman</HI>

Church; which, &s;aid they, would not be the Catholick Church; had it not Mini&s;ters in all parts of the inhabited World In a word, the&s;e Mi&s;&s;ionaries have no more in all <HI>Georgia</HI> then the two Hou&s;es already mention'd. The Wars of <HI>Imiretta</HI> and <HI>Guriel,</HI> and the Calamities of tho&s;e Countries, have forc'd 'em to quit &s;everal Settlements which they had made in tho&s;e parts. And their de&s;ign was, when I parted from <HI>Tefflis,</HI> to vi&s;it <HI>Kaket</HI> in <HI>June,</HI> and &s;everal other places upon Mount <HI>Cauca&s;us.</HI> Their Mi&s;&s;ion con&s;i&s;ted of twelve Per&s;ons, nine Prie&s;ts, and three Lay-Brothers.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Tefflis</HI> is very well peopl'd; and there are as many Strangers re&s;ort thither as to any place in the World. For it drives a great Trade, and the Court is very Numerous and Magnificent, be&s;eeming the Capital of a <HI>Province,</HI> being never without &s;everal Grandees of Note.</P>
<P>As to the Name of the City, I could never learn the Ety|mology of the word. They &s;ay, the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> gave it that Name. Certain it is however, that the <HI>Georgians</HI> do not call it <HI>Tefflis,</HI> but <HI>Cala,</HI> that is to &s;ay, the City or the Fortre&s;s; which is indeed a Name that they give to all Spacious Habita|tions encompa&s;s'd with Walls. Which makes me think, that becau&s;e they have no other Wall'd City in all the Country, they would give it no other Name but <HI>Cala.</HI> Some Geogra|phers call it <HI>Tebele-Cala,</HI> or the Hot City, by rea&s;on of the Baths of Hot Waters within it, or el&s;e becau&s;e the Air is not &s;o cold nor &s;o boy&s;trous as in the other parts of <HI>Georgia.</HI> Nei|ther could I learn the Time when the City was founded, nor the mo&s;t remarkable Revolutions that have befallen it. For my part I do not believe its Antiquity &s;urpa&s;&s;es Eight Hun|derd Years. It has been twice under the Power of the <HI>Turks.</HI> Once in the Reign of <HI>I&s;hmael</HI> the Second King of <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> and the &s;econd time, in the Reign of his Succe&s;&s;or, <HI>Solyman</HI> be|coming Ma&s;ter of it, at the &s;ame time almo&s;t that he took <HI>Tauris.</HI> The <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Tables place it in 83 Degrees of Longi|tude, and 43 Deg. 5. min. of Latitude. It is al&s;o call'd <HI>Dar el Melec,</HI> or the Royal City, as being the Metropolis of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>The 10th the Superiour of the <HI>Capuchins</HI> gave the Viceroy Notice of my Arrival. I de&s;ir'd him &s;o to do, con&s;idering with my &s;elf, that having Servants and Luggage, and being lodg'd at the <HI>Capuchins</HI> Hou&s;e, my Arrival could not be con|ceal'd from a Prince who had Intelligence even of the mo&s;t
<PB N="214" REF="120">
trivial Things that pa&s;s'd in <HI>Tefflis,</HI> much more of my Adven|tures in <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> of which many People had &s;pread a report. Be&s;ides, I was glad to &s;ee him, and &s;hew him the King of <HI>Per|&s;ia</HI>'s Pa&s;&s;ports, directed to all the Governours of Provinces, wherein I was effectually recommended. For I made no Que|&s;tion but the <HI>Prince</HI> upon the &s;ight of tho&s;e Orders would make me Welcom, and grant me a Convoy, if I &s;hould have occa&s;ion, for the re&s;t of my Journey. <HI>Shanavas-Can</HI> under|&s;tanding who I was, and that the deceas'd King had employ'd me into <HI>Europe</HI> upon his own Service and Affairs, order'd the Superiour to tell me in his Name, That I was Welcom, that he was glad of my Arrival, and that I would do him a Kind|ne&s;s to come and &s;ee him as &s;oon as I could; which I was neither in a Condition, neither was I re&s;olv'd to do &s;o &s;oon: being re&s;olv'd to &s;tay till I was ready to depart, becau&s;e I would not be oblig'd to go every Day to Court. Therefore I de&s;ir'd Father <HI>Raphael,</HI> who was his Phy&s;ician, to tell him, That I was overjoy'd at the Honour which he had done me, and that I would not fail to pay my Duty to him, &s;o &s;oon as I had put my &s;elf into a hand&s;om Equipage; but that I was &s;o out of order, that I could not &s;tir abroad the&s;e Ten Days. I know not whether Father <HI>Raphael</HI> made a true Report to the Prince, or whether the Prince believ'd him; for &s;o it hap|pen'd, that about Twelve a Clock in the Forenoon, he &s;ent a Gentleman to tell me, That &s;ince I was come to Town in a Week of Mirth and Jollity, while he Fea&s;ted every Day at Court, he de&s;ir'd that I would come and &s;ee him. I was &s;ur|priz'd and troubl'd at the Me&s;&s;age; and therefore I de&s;ir'd the Superiour and Father <HI>Raphael</HI> to let the Prince know, That I could not yet &s;tir abroad, and that he would be pleas'd to con|de&s;cend that I might &s;tay till the <HI>Sunday</HI> following before I receiv'd the Honour which he was pleas'd to do me. Which Me&s;&s;age the <HI>Capuchins</HI> promis'd to deliver, but fail'd. They went to the Court 'tis true, but return'd the next moment, to tell me, That the Prince was impatient to hear what News from <HI>Europe.</HI> But the truth of it was, that they had an extra|ordinary de&s;ire to produce me. They were de&s;irous to &s;hew the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI>'s Agent, whom they a&s;&s;erted to be one of their own Nation, to the end them&s;elves might be the more re&s;pected; and they de&s;ir'd my Comrade and my &s;elf to put on our mo&s;t Sumptuous Habit, and to enlarge for their &s;akes the Pre&s;ent which we intended for the <HI>Prince.</HI> In which par|ticular I was willing to gratifie 'em, and in whatever el&s;e I
<PB N="215" REF="120">
might conveniently do, as being glad of an Opportunity to acknowledge the &s;ignal Kindne&s;&s;es they had done me.</P>
<P>It was almo&s;t Noon when we went to the <HI>Palace,</HI> accom|pany'd by the Superiour and Father <HI>Raphael,</HI> who attended to be a&s;&s;i&s;tant to us. The <HI>Prince</HI> was in a Room of State, a Hun|derd and Ten Foot long, and above Forty broad, built upon the &s;ide of the River, and all open on that &s;ide. The Ceel|ing, which was all of <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> Work, was plac'd upon a great Number of Pillars, Painted and Gilt between 35 and 40 Foot high. The whole Room was &s;pread with very fair Carpets. The <HI>Prince</HI> and principal Nobility were &s;itting near three little Chimneys, which with &s;everal Bra&s;iers warm'd the Room to that degree, that the Cold was not felt. <HI>Shanavas-Can,</HI> when people approach'd near him, caus'd him&s;elf to be Reverenc'd the fir&s;t time, like the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> Him&s;elf. They fell upon their Knees Two or Three Paces di&s;tant from his Per|&s;on, and bow their Heads to the Ground, Three Times one after another. Which manner of Saluting the Ea&s;tern Prin|ces, the <HI>Europeans</HI> have always &s;crupl'd to ob&s;erve. And in|deed it being impo&s;&s;ible that a Man &s;hould pro&s;trate him|&s;elf in a more humble po&s;ture, &s;uch a Pro&s;tration &s;hould on|ly be us'd before GOD him&s;elf. So that &s;ometimes they excu&s;e them&s;elves from u&s;ing this manner of Salutation, by &s;aying they are of another World, and under&s;tand not the Complements of the Country. For my part I made my Obey&s;ance with three Bows, without Kneeling. Afterward two Gentlemen led me to take my place: but I would not &s;it above the <HI>Capuchins,</HI> though the Gentlemen pre&s;s'd me &s;o to do, and the Steward of the Hou&s;hold who &s;tood upon his Feet in the middle of the Room. For I was willing to do 'em that Honour, that they might have Honour done 'em by others. Which the Superiour was &s;o glad to &s;ee, that he would needs have me take place of his Companion.</P>
<P>While I was paying my Obey&s;ance, a Gentleman who had receiv'd from me at the Hall Door the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI>'s Letters Patents which I held in my Hand, and the Pre&s;ent which I had brought for the Prince, and lay'd 'em in order in a large Silver Voider, &s;et down the Voider at the Prince's Feet. Pre|&s;ently he took the Patent, open'd it, and ri&s;ing up from his Seat put it to his Lips, and lay'd it upon his Forehead, then gave it to his Chief Mini&s;ter to tell him the Contents. After|wards he view'd the Pre&s;ent with a great deal of Curio&s;ity
<PB N="216" REF="121">
and Satisfaction; which con&s;i&s;ted of &s;everal pieces; that is to &s;ay,</P>
<P>A large Watch, with a Lunary Motion, in a Silver Ca&s;e, Engrav'd and Gilt.</P>
<P>A Looking-Gla&s;s of Chri&s;tal of the Rock, in a Silver Frame.</P>
<P>A Gold Enamel'd Box to put <HI>Opium</HI> Pills in. For the mo&s;t part of the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> take tho&s;e Pills &s;everal times a day.</P>
<P>A Surgeons Ca&s;e, furni&s;h'd with all &s;orts of In&s;truments; being a very Delicate and Curious Piece of VVorkman&s;hip.</P>
<P>Knives with Handles, Neat and Delicately wrought.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Mini&s;ter after he had receiv'd the Patent, with a low Voice gave the Prince an Account of the Contents. And I under&s;tood afterwards that the Prince &s;hould &s;ay, they had never read a Patent more Effectual nor more Honourable, and that they had very &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider'd it. All the Grandees admir'd the Golden Character, and the More&s;co-Flouri&s;hes in the Margent which were very large. The Prince caus'd it to be Copy'd; and I thought it not ami&s;s to give ye the Tran&s;la|tion of it as follows.</P>

The <HI>Patent</HI> is writ upon a Sheet of Paper two Foot and a half long; it is al&s;o beautifi'd with Letters of Gold, Blew, Red and Black. And therefore I have mark'd in great Letters, what is written in Letters of Gold, and what is written in the Original in Coloured Letters, I have inclo&s;ed between two little Hooks.</P>
<P>1. It is in the Original, <HI>Hou Alla &s;ub han Hou.</HI> Which is an <HI>Arabian</HI> Sentence taken out of the <HI>Alcoran. Hou</HI> in this Language is the E&s;&s;ential Name of GOD, and not <HI>Alla,</HI> which &s;ignifies <HI>Mo&s;t High.</HI> This <HI>Hou</HI> is the <HI>Jehova</HI> of the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> and &s;ignifies <HI>He,</HI> or <HI>He there.</HI> It &s;ignifies al&s;o <HI>is,</HI> or <HI>He that is;</HI> by which is to be under&s;tood a <HI>Being of Him&s;elf,</HI> and <HI>Uncreated.</HI> This Name is to be met with in the <HI>Alcoran</HI> in a number of places; and it &s;eems that the Impo&s;tor who Com|pos'd that Book alludes to that Pa&s;&s;age in the Third of <HI>Exo|dus, He who is, has &s;ent me.</HI> The <HI>Mahometans</HI> place this word <HI>Hou</HI> over all their Decrees, Statutes, Petitions, and al|mo&s;t over all their VVritings. And &s;ometimes they add, <HI>Alla ta a Alla,</HI> that is to &s;ay, <HI>He who is, is GOD Mo&s;t High.</HI></P>
<P>2. The&s;e words ought to refer to the bottom of the <HI>Patent</HI> after the&s;e, <HI>Being a Decree from above, Elevated on High above all things,</HI> as much as to &s;ay, That GOD is &s;till above. The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> have this Cu&s;tom in any Act or Decree, never to put the Name of GOD at the bottom of the Leaf; but they place it at the top upon the &s;ide, and leave a Blank in that part to which it ought to refer. And this &s;ame Circum&s;pection they ob&s;erve with great Super&s;tition, believing that they who fail therein, fail of their Re&s;pect to GOD. They have the &s;ame Re&s;pect for the King and the re&s;t of his Mini&s;ters, in their Juridical Writings, their Petitions, and their Publick Acts: for they never in&s;ert 'em into the Body of the Writing, but always at the top of the Page upon the Right-Hand.</P>
<P>3. This word <HI>Prophetick</HI> &s;et at the top, for the rea&s;on al|ready ob&s;erv'd, is relative to that at the bottom of the Patent: <HI>The Holy Flight,</HI> to &s;ignifie that the Computation of Time, which begins from the Flight of <HI>Mahomet</HI> from <HI>Mecca</HI> to <HI>Medina,</HI> is an <HI>Epoche</HI> of Sacred In&s;titution, and that it took its Original and it's Beginning from the time that the Per&s;on whom they call by way of Excellency, <HI>The Prophet,</HI> began his Mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<PB N="218" REF="123">
<P>4. They that under&s;tand little of the Religion and Cu&s;toms of the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> cannot be ignorant of this Invocation, in regard they pronounce it at the beginning of all their Actions, and all their Prayers. The mo&s;t famous Profe&s;&s;ors of the Ori|ental Languages, &s;ay, That it ought to be thus Tran&s;lated, <HI>In the Name of GOD Soveraignly-Merciful.</HI> And indeed, the <HI>Ara|bian</HI> word <HI>Rahmen,</HI> which &s;ignifies <HI>Merciful,</HI> is an Incommu|nicable Attribute of GOD, and which they never make u&s;e of but in &s;peaking of the <HI>Divine Clemency.</HI> All the <HI>Mahome|tans</HI> believe that this Invocation conceals great My&s;teries, and enclo&s;es an infinite number of Vertues. For they have it al|ways in their Mouths, ri&s;ing, &s;itting, taking a Book or an In|&s;trument in their Hands, or a Pen. In a word, they believe they &s;hall not pro&s;per in any thing which they undertake, if they do not begin with this Invocation. They a&s;&s;ure them|&s;elves that <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> &s;poke it before they went about any Bu&s;ine&s;s. It is &s;et at the beginning of every Chapter in the <HI>Alcoran.</HI> And it is evident that it is in Imitation of the u&s;ual Sayings of the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> the one always beginning thus, <HI>Our Aid be in the Name of GOD, who Created Heaven and Earth:</HI> and the other with the&s;e words, <HI>In the Name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;peak in another place of the Seal which is fix'd to this Patent, and of what is grav'd within. The Figure under it is call'd <HI>Ni&s;han,</HI> that is, the <HI>Signal,</HI> and al&s;o the Flouri&s;h beneath the Sub&s;cription. It is here drawn with a Ruler, but in the Original it is made of the Tails of Letters. The Se|cretary who is us'd to write this Sub&s;cription draws tho&s;e Tails &s;o &s;treight and &s;o equal, that you would take 'em for Lines drawn by Rule and Compa&s;s. The whole Sub&s;cription is in Colour'd Letters, except the word which &s;ignifies <HI>Lord of the World,</HI> and tho&s;e which I have Tran&s;lated <HI>Ab&s;olutely Commands,</HI> which are in Letters of Gold. The words <HI>Zels Ziouzoumis,</HI> are ancient Turki&s;h &s;till in u&s;e in the <HI>Le&s;&s;er Tartary.</HI> They &s;ignifie properly <HI>My Words,</HI> or <HI>I &s;peak.</HI> And <HI>Tamberlain</HI> be|ing the fir&s;t that made u&s;e of tho&s;e words in his Patents, the Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> have &s;till retain'd the Cu&s;tom. The twelve Names which are in the middle of the Flouri&s;h beneath the Sub&s;cription, are the Names of the twelve <HI>Pontiffs,</HI> real and lawful Succe&s;&s;ors of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> according to the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Be|lief.</P>
<PB N="219" REF="123">
<P>5. The Governours in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> are di&s;tingui&s;h'd into Great and Petty. <HI>Media</HI> and <HI>Georgia</HI> for Example are great Govern|ments; <HI>Caramania</HI> and <HI>Gedro&s;ia</HI> petty Governments: There|fore they call <HI>Beglerbeg,</HI> which &s;ignifies <HI>Lord of Lords,</HI> the Governour of a Great Government; and the <HI>Viceroy</HI> of a Petty Government they call a <HI>Kan.</HI></P>
<P>6. <HI>De&s;ton, Tahem-ten-ten,</HI> and <HI>Feribours,</HI> are the Names of the ancient <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Heroes, or if you plea&s;e of the Old Giants, which deriv'd their Being from the ancient Fables. The&s;e are the <HI>Alcides</HI>'s and the <HI>The&s;eus</HI>'s of the <HI>Per&s;ians;</HI> and as the <HI>Grecian Alcides</HI> had &s;everal Names, &s;o likewi&s;e has the <HI>Per&s;ian:</HI> but the mo&s;t common Name which they have alway in their Mouths is that of <HI>Ru&s;tem.</HI></P>
<P>7. <HI>Ardevon</HI> is the Name of an Ancient Giant or <HI>Hero,</HI> who as the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> &s;ay, conquer'd all <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and &s;etl'd the Seat of his Empire in <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> Their Hi&s;tories have not pre&s;erv'd the Memory of any of his Atchievements: but their Romances feign an infinite Number which are altogether fabulous.</P>
<P>8. In the Original it is, <HI>Who unloo&s;e all &s;orts of Knots.</HI></P>
<P>9. There is no People in the World more &s;otti&s;hly devoted to Judicial A&s;trology then the <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI> Of which being to &s;peak in another place, I &s;hall &s;ay no more here, but that the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> rank all Penmen, Books and Writings under <HI>Mercury,</HI> whom they call <HI>Attared,</HI> and hold all People born under that Planet to be endu'd with a refin'd, penetrating, clear-&s;ighted, and fubtil Wit.</P>
<P>10. <HI>Caagon</HI> is the Name of an Ancient King of <HI>China:</HI> Nor is there any one over the whole <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> who&s;e Memory is more Venerable. It &s;eems, by what they report, that he was more particularly Illu&s;trious in his Country for his Go|vernment in Peace and Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice, then for his Feats of Arms. Therefore the Ea&s;tern Monarchs a&s;&s;ume his Name to them&s;elves, as the Roman Emperors call'd them&s;elves <HI>Cae&s;ars.</HI> Moreover, it has the &s;ame &s;ignification in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> as <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> in <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> &s;o that when the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> would expre&s;s any thing that is Great and Royal, they &s;ay, <HI>Caagoni&egrave;.</HI> Thus I have explain'd the truth of this little Figure; and I believe
<PB N="220" REF="124">
we &s;hall be as little troubl'd to under&s;tand the whole Lan|guage of this <HI>Patent,</HI> though Metaphor and Hyperbole are therein mo&s;t furiou&s;ly injur'd.</P>
<P>11. The Term which I have Tran&s;lated <HI>Flowre of Merchants,</HI> &s;ignifies Exqui&s;ite, Choice, Elected, or mo&s;t Excellent. The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> u&s;e it commonly as an Epithet for all &s;orts and Condi|tions of Men; Great Lords, Foreign Mini&s;ters, Merchants; and bring it down even to Trade&s;men.</P>
<P>12. It is in the <HI>Per&s;ian, Nor by Importunate Flatteries, nor by Hanghty Demands.</HI></P>
<P>13. The word which I have Tran&s;lated <HI>To Incourage,</HI> &s;ig|nifies properly <HI>To Water.</HI></P>
<P>14. The&s;e words <HI>In Dignity and Virtue,</HI> are not in the <HI>Pa|tent,</HI> only I have put 'em in the place of tho&s;e that are, which &s;ignifies the <HI>Seal of great Quality re&s;embling the Sun.</HI></P>
<P>15. The&s;e words are to be referr'd to the words <HI>Ab&s;olutely Commands,</HI> which are under the Flouri&s;h beneath the Sub&s;cri|ption. They are call'd here <HI>The Decree of the Lord of the World. Tamberlain</HI> was the fir&s;t that made u&s;e of the&s;e lofty Expre&s;&s;ions. Now the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> and the <HI>Indian</HI> Monarch make u&s;e of 'em as well as the King of <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> while every one maintains that it belongs to him only, and a&s;&s;umes it as his mo&s;t Glorious Title. In the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Language it is, <HI>Saheb-Cerani.</HI> It may be al&s;o interpreted <HI>Ma&s;ter of the Age,</HI> but the other Tran&s;lation is more clear and intelligible, and di&s;covers more plainly the &s;otti&s;h pride that is contein'd in it.</P>
<P>16. We &s;hall &s;peak more particularly in another place of the Marks by which the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> di&s;tingui&s;h Times and Sea|&s;ons. Here therefore I &s;hall &s;ay no more then for the under|&s;tanding of the Date, that the Month <HI>Shavel</HI> is the tenth, and that the <HI>Arabians</HI> have given Epithets to all the Months; as for Example, to the <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> the Epithet of <HI>Sacred;</HI> to the <HI>Se|venth,</HI> that of <HI>Prai&s;e-worthy;</HI> to the <HI>Ninth,</HI> that of <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed;</HI> and to this here mention'd the Stile of <HI>Honourable.</HI> The word <HI>Hegyra,</HI> which is Tran&s;lated <HI>Flight,</HI> proceeds from a Verb, which &s;ignifies to <HI>fly,</HI> as al&s;o to <HI>retire.</HI> So that the <HI>He|gyra</HI> of the <HI>Mahometans</HI> is the &s;ame thing with the <HI>Exodus</HI> of
<PB N="221" REF="124">
the <HI>Hebrews.</HI> And without doubt <HI>Omar</HI> had that &s;ame <HI>Exo|dus</HI> in his Mind, when he &s;etl'd the <HI>Mahometan Epact,</HI> from the time of <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s departure from <HI>Mecca,</HI> which was the place in <HI>Arabia</HI> where Idols and Idolatry were mo&s;t in E&s;teem.</P>

This &s;ame Cu&s;tom of forbidding Women the Company of Men, has been only in <HI>Georgia,</HI> &s;ince the Country became &s;ubject to the <HI>Per&s;ians;</HI> nor is this Prohibition but only in the Cities. For in the Country, and in &s;uch places where there are no <HI>Mahometans,</HI> they go without Vails, and make no &s;cru|ple both to come into Company, and di&s;cour&s;e with Men at their plea&s;ure. But in regard the Cu&s;toms of the <HI>Mahometans</HI> prevail more and more in <HI>Georgia</HI> with their Religion, we find the Women to be more and more re&s;train'd of their Liberty: and that lovely Sex are forc'd out of Confor|mity to good Manners to keep apart by them&s;elves. The Nuptial Fea&s;t was kept upon a Terra&s;s of the <HI>Palace,</HI> &s;ur|rounded with Beds of State, or <HI>E&s;trades</HI> rais'd about two Foot, and &s;ix Foot in depth. The Terra&s;s was cover'd with a large Pavillion fix'd upon five Pillars, two and twenty Foot high, and about five Inches in Diameter. The Lining was of Cloth of Gold and Silver, Velvet and painted Cloath &s;o neatly and artificially intermix'd, that by the Light of the Tapers it look'd like a Wain&s;cot of Flowers and <HI>More&s;co</HI> Work. In the mid&s;t of this &s;ort of Room of State, if I may &s;o call it, &s;tood a large Fountain &s;pouting out Water. However, we did not feel the Coldne&s;s of the Weather: For the Crowd of People, and the large moving Hearths that were in the Room, almo&s;t &s;tew'd us before we got out. The Floor was cover'd with fair Carpets, and about Forty Branches gave Light to the whole Room. Of which the Four that hung next the <HI>Prince</HI> were of Gold, the re&s;t of Silver; which Branches u&s;ually weigh Forty Pounds apiece, the Foot being a matter of Fifteen Inches in Diame|ter. The Branch about a Foot and a half high, carries a Bowl full of pure Tallow, which feeds two lighted Matches. And the&s;e &s;ort of Lamps give a very great Light.</P>

Who having taken his place, the Princes Relations, went every one to Complement and Pre&s;ent him. Which was al&s;o done by the greate&s;t part of the Gue&s;ts, in&s;omuch that it look't like a kind of Proce&s;&s;ion, which was the rea&s;on it la&s;ted above half an Hour. The Pre&s;ents con&s;i&s;ted in Money, &s;ome Gold, &s;ome Silver, as al&s;o in little Silver Cups. I confe&s;s I was de&s;i|rous to know how much the Pre&s;ents amounted to; but as far as I could find, 'twas no &s;uch great Sum, as not exceeding above Two Hundred Crowns.</P>
<P>However, let it be what it will, in the height of this Cere|mony, Supper was &s;erv'd up in this manner. In the fir&s;t place Table Cloaths were &s;pread before all the Gue&s;ts, and in three parts of the Court before the Tent. Which Table Cloaths were as large as the E&s;trades. After which done, the Bread was &s;erv'd in. Of which there were three &s;orts, the one as thin as Paper, the next about a Finger thick, and the third &s;weeten'd with Sugar. The Meat was brought in cover'd in large Silver Di&s;hes, but far larger then are made in <HI>Europe.</HI> The Plate and the Cover u&s;ually weighing about Four Hundred and Five Hundred Ounces. They that brought up the Di&s;hes fir&s;t into the Room, &s;et 'em down in order upon a Table Cloath at the Entrance; from whence other Officers carry'd 'em before the Squire-Carvers, who cut off &s;everal hollow Plates full, and order'd 'em to be &s;ent to the Gue&s;ts: the Prin|ces being fir&s;t &s;erv'd, and afterwards the re&s;t according to their Degrees: and the cu&s;tom is to Carve one Di&s;h to all the Com|pany; then of another, and &s;o of all the re&s;t. The whole Fea&s;t con&s;i&s;ted of three Cour&s;es every one containing Sixty of tho&s;e large &s;lat Di&s;hes a piece. The Fir&s;t was of all &s;orts of <HI>Pilo,</HI> or Rice boyl'd with Meat, of which they make &s;e|veral &s;orts of di&s;tinct Colours and Ta&s;ts. The Yellow is boyl'd with Sugar, Cinamon and Saffron. The Red, with Juice of Pomegranates, but the White is mo&s;t natural and the be&s;t. This <HI>Pilo</HI> is a very good &s;ort of Diet, plea&s;ing to the Ta&s;t and very whole&s;ome</P>
<P>The Second Cour&s;e was of Meats Bak'd, Stew'd, and Fri|ca&s;&s;y'd; and other Ragoo's of the &s;ame Nature. The Third of Roa&s;ted. Not but that in all the three Cour&s;es there was an Intermixture of Fi&s;h, Eggs, and Salades for the &s;ake of the Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks. For our parts they &s;erv'd us both the Fle&s;h and Fi&s;h. In a Word, every thing was &s;et upon the Table, and taken away with that order and &s;ilence that was to be admir'd. Every one did his Duty without &s;peaking a word. So that you

&s;hall hear three French-Men at one Table make more noi&s;e then a Hunderd and Fifty Per&s;ons, that were in the Room at that Fea&s;t.</P>
<P>But that which was mo&s;t to be wonder'd at after all this ex|cellent order, was the Court Cupboard which contain'd about a Hunderd and Twenty Ve&s;&s;els, that appertain'd to Drinking; Bowls, Cups, Horns, Sixty Flagons and Twelve Jugs. The Jugs were for the mo&s;t part Silver. The Bowls and Cups were &s;ome of Poli&s;h'd Gold, others Gold Enamell'd, &s;ome &s;et with pretious Stones, others only Silver; the Horns were Em|belli&s;h'd after the &s;ame manner as the Richer &s;ort of Cups; and of &s;everal proportions. The ordinary ones were about Eight Inches High, Broad at the Top about Two, very black and Poli&s;h'd. Some were of <HI>Rhinoceros</HI>'s Snouts, others of Dears Horns, whereas the Common &s;ort were made of the Horns of Oxen and Sheep. However the Cu&s;tom of making u&s;e of 'em for Drinking Cups, and Embelli&s;hing 'em has been all along ob&s;erv'd among the Ea&s;tern People. I cannot tell how long the Fea&s;t la&s;ted: for I did not &s;tay it out. Only this I know, that though it was Midnight before we went away, the Roa&s;t|meat was not then taken off the Table. Nor did they begin to Drink at fir&s;t, till the Third Cour&s;e came, that they began to be Warm, and then they Drank their Healths after this man|ner. They &s;ent to Eight Per&s;ons, who were the Prince's nea|re&s;t Relations, four upon the Right, and four upon the Left, Eight Bowls of the &s;ame Bigne&s;s and Equally full of Wine. At what time they ro&s;e and &s;tood up till they had Drank; they that were upon the Right Hand Drinking fir&s;t: they on the left hand Pledg'd 'em; and then the &s;ame Eight Bowls were fill'd again, and carry'd to the next in the &s;ame order till the Health was gone Round. Which done, they began again Eight Bigger Bowls. For the Cu&s;tom of the Country is to Drink the Grandees Health la&s;t in the bigge&s;t Cups. Which is done on purpo&s;e to Fuddle their Gue&s;ts the more Effectu|ally; by that means engaging 'em out of Re&s;pect and E&s;teem for the Per&s;ons to Drink the more Liberally till they are quite Drunk. In this manner they Drank all the two la&s;t Hours that I &s;tay'd at the Fea&s;t, and as afterwards I under&s;tood, from that time till next Morning. The fir&s;t Bowls held no more then an Ordinary Gla&s;s: and for the la&s;t which I &s;aw Drank off, they held about a Pint and a half. Neverthele&s;s they were only tho&s;e that were accounted Moderate Draughts. The <HI>Capuchins</HI> and my &s;elf were exempted from Drinking, and in

truth, had I Drank as much as my Neighbours, I had dy'd upon the Spot: but the Prince had &s;o much kindne&s;s for us as to give order not to carry us any Healths; neverthele&s;s we had both Wine and Water, and a Gold Tumbler &s;tanding before us all the while. But they never fill'd us, but when we call'd for it. When the Healths were began, the Mu&s;ick began to Play: being a confus'd mixture of Vocal and In&s;trumental, which &s;o pleas'd the Company, that they &s;eem'd Ravi&s;h'd with it. But for my part I could hear nothing that was Mu&s;ical, but rather only what was har&s;h and full of di&s;cord. The Prince al&s;o being in a plea&s;ant Humour, as upon whom the Liquor began to work, &s;ent to the Superiour to bid him &s;end for his <HI>Spinette.</HI> Who with his Comrade were no le&s;s mad at the Extravagant Fancy of the Prince, though the Chief cau&s;e of their di&s;gu&s;t was my being there, fearing I &s;hould make &s;ome Relation of the Pa&s;|&s;age to their Di&s;advantage, and aggravate their fawning Compli|ance upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion; that a Superiour of a Mi&s;&s;ion, &s;hould conde&s;cend to pro&s;titute him&s;elf like a Fidler before a <HI>Mahometan</HI> Prince, in and A&s;&s;embly of Infidels and Hereticks, Clergy and Laity, that in the Condition they were in, might well be term'd an A&s;&s;embly of Drunkards. However when the <HI>Spinette</HI> came they &s;et it upon the Table in the mid&s;t of the Room, and the Superiour was orderd to Play; at what time the Prince having order'd him to Sing and Play together, he fir&s;t Sung the <HI>Magnificat,</HI> the <HI>Te Denni,</HI> and <HI>Tantum Ergo,</HI> and after that &s;everal Court-Aires in <HI>Italian</HI> and <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> for the Church Mu&s;ick was then too Grave for the Prince Be&s;ides the <HI>Spinette</HI> was out of Tune, and the Superiour play'd out a Tune a purpo&s;e, and being very Old be&s;ide, and brok'n with Age and Labour, you may well Judge what fort of Diverti&s;ement his Con&s;ort could be. However it was Pa&s;time for the Prince for Two Hours together. During which time, the Steward of the Hou&s;hould came to me, and ask'd me whither the u&s;e of In&s;truments were permitted in our Religion? To which when I an&s;wer'd <HI>It was;</HI> he reply'd that the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Religion forbid it expre&s;sly; and though it were generally us'd in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> yet yet that cu&s;tom did not make it Lawful. He told me moreover that In&s;truments were particularly forbid in the exerci&s;e of Re|ligion, in regard that GOD requir'd only the Prai&s;es of Hu|man Voice. During which di&s;pute, a <HI>Georgian</HI> Bi&s;hop fell in|to di&s;cour&s;e with Father <HI>Raphael</HI> upon the &s;ame Subject.

Father <HI>Raphael</HI> al&s;o added, That he took it very ill, that the Viceroy had us'd his Autho|rity &s;o far, to oblige the Superiour to play upon the Lute, and &s;ing at every turn to plea&s;e his Humour; only that their Se|curity depended &s;o much upon his Favour, that they dur&s;t not deny him any thing. About Midnight therefore, as I told yee, we left 'em; after we had tak'n leave of the Prince with all due Reverence.

<P>The 17th, reflecting upon the Title of King of <HI>Spain,</HI> which the <HI>Prince</HI> had a&s;&s;um'd to him&s;elf, and finding that it was not incoherent with what &s;everal Authors alledge, that the <HI>Spa|niard</HI> Originally came out of <HI>Iberia,</HI> I ask'd the <HI>Capuchins,</HI> How the <HI>Prince</HI> claim'd Affinity with the King of <HI>Spain?</HI> They an&s;wer'd, That <HI>Clement</HI> the VIII. having written to <HI>Taymuras,</HI> and in his Letters call'd him Kin&s;man to <HI>Philip</HI> the Second, and the <HI>Iberians</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> Brothers, his Succe&s;&s;ors ever &s;ince retain'd that Imaginary Kindred.

<P>The Twentieth, I de&s;ir'd the Prefect or Superiour of the <HI>Theatins,</HI> and Father <HI>Raphael</HI> to return Thanks to the Prince for the Favours and Honours he had done me, and to pray him that I might have an Officer to conduct me to <HI>Irivan</HI> the chief City of <HI>Armenia</HI> the Greater. To which the Prince &s;a|tisfi'd with the Complement, and no le&s;s ready to grant me my reque&s;t, Commanded the <HI>Capuchins</HI> to tell me, <HI>That he had a great Kindne&s;s for the</HI> Europeans, <HI>and would have wi&s;h'd I could have &s;tay'd longer at</HI> Tefflis, <HI>to the end he might have made it more clear to me what he profe&s;s'd; but that he would not pre&s;ume, nei|ther had he any de&s;ire to &s;top me, becau&s;e I was going upon the Kings bu&s;ine&s;s, and therefore that I was at Liberty to go when I pleas'd; that there was all manner of &s;ecurity within his Territo|ries, and that therefore I needed no Convoy; neverthele&s;s that he would &s;end one of his Officers along with me if I de&s;ir'd it.</HI></P>
<P>The Fathers told me afterwards that he had held 'em in a long di&s;cour&s;e concerning his earne&s;t de&s;ire that the <HI>Europeans</HI> would come and &s;ettle in <HI>Georgia,</HI> to which purpo&s;e they had orders to tell me, that if they would come thither for Trade, he would Grant 'em all the Priviledges and Advantages they

could de&s;ire. That his Territories extended to the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI> and that bearing a great &s;way in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and being highly e&s;teem'd in <HI>Turkey,</HI> &s;uch <HI>Europeans</HI> as de&s;ign'd to the <HI>Indies,</HI> could not chu&s;e a better Road then through his Territories; and that he was a&s;&s;ur'd that when they had once travell'd it, they would always make choice of it for the future.</P>
<P>I de&s;ir'd the Fathers to return my mo&s;t humble Thanks to the Prince, for the Kindne&s;s which he had for our Nation; and to let him know, That I would not fail to give to the <HI>French Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company Notice of his good Intentions, which if he would be pleas'd to &s;ignifie in a Letter, I would certainly take care to have it &s;ent. La&s;tly, That he would do me a great Honour to grant me one of his Dome&s;tick Servants, to Conduct me to the next Government, of which I &s;hould not fail to give an Account to the King and his Mini&s;ters, when I &s;hould be arriv'd at <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI></P>
<P>The 24th, the <HI>Tibilelle</HI> (for &s;o is the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Tefflis</HI> call'd, as I have &s;aid already) came to &s;ee me. He told me, That the Prince had commanded him to acquaint me, That having con|&s;ider'd upon what I had &s;ent to him about Writing to the <HI>French</HI> Company for &s;etling a Trade, and a Pa&s;&s;age through <HI>Georgia,</HI> He was about to have done it, to inform 'em of the Advantage they might make of a Trade into that Country: but in regard he was no more then a Va&s;&s;al to the King of <HI>Per|&s;ia,</HI> he was afraid his Maje&s;ty would look upon it as a Crime to have Written without his Order to Strangers about Bu|&s;ine&s;s. However, I might a&s;&s;ure 'em this, That if they would &s;end Factors into his Country, they &s;hould find many &s;orts of Merchandizes that were proper for <HI>Europe</HI> very cheap; be&s;ides that they &s;hould be receiv'd with all the Civility ima|ginable. In an&s;wer to which I de&s;ir'd the <HI>Tibilelle</HI> to a&s;&s;ure the Prince that I would faithfully di&s;charge my Tru&s;t. The Prelate &s;taid with me about a quarter of an Hour in my Cham|ber; and at his departure I pre&s;ented him a very fair Ro&s;ary of Coral: according to the Cu&s;tom of Repaying the Vi&s;its of a Per&s;on of Quality. Nor were the <HI>Capuchins</HI> le&s;s glad of the Vi&s;it I had receiv'd, then of the manner of my Acknowledg|ment, in regard the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Tefflis</HI> had never been at their Hou&s;e before.</P>
<P>The 25th, the Prince &s;ent me a Pre&s;ent of Wine, and order'd the Me&s;&s;enger to tell me, That he had appointed a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> of his own Family for my Guide; that he had commanded a Let|ter of Orders to be di&s;patch'd that I might &s;et forward as &s;oon as I pleas'd.</P>

<P>For the Drop&s;ie, &rindx; half a Dram of the Juice of the Roots of Garden-Chiches, and repeat the Remedy every other Day.</P>

<P>For the Yellow Jaundi&s;e, Make a Bed of Boyl'd Rice, and lay the Patient well cover'd upon it; or el&s;e put him into a Bath of Milk, and it works the &s;ame effect.</P>
<P>For External Pains of the Joynts, Take either the Deco|ction or the Perfume of three Drams of Hellebore.</P>

<P>For Defluxions and Rheumes to the Head and Throat, Take Perfume of Yellow Amber.</P>
<P>For the Dy&s;entery, Give the Infu&s;ion of the Leaves and Berries of Myrtle; or el&s;e the Blood of a Ro&s;ted Hare infus'd in Wine.</P>

<P>Again&s;t a Pleure&s;y, take two little thin Cakes of ordinary Meal, and boil 'em in Water with Roch-Allum and <HI>Madder,</HI> and apply 'em as hot as may be endur'd upon the &s;ide, the one behind and the other before: this Remedy mu&s;t be dayly re|peated till the Cure be perfected.</P>
<P>Again&s;t a Cough, make u&s;e of the Root of the Herb call'd Hounds-Tongue or Dogs-Tongue.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t u&s;ual Cure for Agues in this Country, is to make Plai&s;ters of the Fat of a Sheeps Rump, Cinamon, Cloves and Cardamomes, and all the time of the cold fit to lay the&s;e Plai|&s;ters upon the Forehead, Stomach and Feet. When the hot fit is over, take off tho&s;e Plai&s;ters and lay on others, made of the Leaves of <HI>Cichory,</HI> Plantain, and the Herb call'd <HI>Solanum</HI> or Night&s;hade, afterwards they take a Sucking-Pig, cut it in two and clap it to the Feet. All which time the Patient is fed with Bread and Cream of Almonds, eating nothing that is boyl'd.</P>
<P>Father <HI>Raphael</HI> a&s;&s;ur'd me that he had &s;een 'em in that Coun|try cure Agues, by carrying the Patient in the height of his Cold fit and plunging him over Head and Ears in the Water. It is a thing hard to be beleiv'd; and in Truth, to me it appear'd a thing altogether Extravagant, in regard it &s;eem'd to be &s;o Dangerous. However it is ob&s;erv'd that the difference of Climates and Temperaments of Countrys produces far diffe|rent effects in Remedies, &s;o that the Remedy, if I may &s;o &s;ay, that Kills in one Country, does but only &s;tir a Man in another.</P>

repay with &s;hrewd Turns tho&s;e to whom they owe their Ad|vancement with as little Check of Con&s;cience, as if they were altogether Strangers. For which rea&s;on it is, that they de&s;ire payment before-hand, &s;tanding very little upon the Nicety of a little Impudence, but demanding a Reward for the &s;malle&s;t Service which they do.</P>
<P>The 28th I &s;et forth from <HI>Tefflis</HI> about Eleven a Clock in the Forenoon; the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Surgeon, and &s;ome <HI>Georgians</HI> with whom I had made an Acquaintance, accompanying me &s;ome part of my way. My Guide rode before to prevent the Toll-gatherers or Receivers of certain &s;mall Duties which are taken upon all Hor&s;es that go loaden out of the City, from demanding any thing of my Servants. Which &s;ort of Guides are call'd <HI>Mehemander,</HI> (a word which fignifies <HI>He who has care of a Gue&s;t:)</HI> and are granted to all Envoys, Amba&s;&s;a|dors and Strangers of Quality. Their Duty is to provide Lodging, Vittles, and Carriage-Hor&s;es for the Per&s;ons whom they Conduct; and in a word, to di&s;charge 'em from all the care of a Traveller. They are like Stewards or Purveyors for tho&s;e Per&s;ons to whom they are appointed for Guides. For they make u&s;e of their Service in every thing, &s;end 'em upon Errands, and to carry Me&s;&s;ages to tho&s;e Per&s;ons, to whom a Man would not be troubl'd to go him&s;elf. The&s;e Guides are well paid for their Service; &s;o that it is a Kindne&s;s to be re|commended to &s;uch an Imployment. The Villages where they pa&s;s make 'em Pre&s;ents, to be the more &s;paring in what Money they rai&s;e, to defray the Expences of Travellers which they have in charge, and to prevent their being too wa&s;tful and lavi&s;h. They take into their protection &s;uch Merchants as are de&s;irous to Travel along with 'em; and be&s;ides that, they &s;ecure 'em from Robbing, and exempt 'em from paying &s;e|veral Tolls and Duties. Which is worth 'em &s;omething more. But their greate&s;t Gain is the Pre&s;ent which mu&s;t be made 'em when they are &s;ent back.</P>
<P>I was very glad to &s;ee my &s;elf got &s;afe out of <HI>Tefflis.</HI> For I was afraid I &s;hould there be put to &s;ome kind of trouble for two Rea&s;ons. The fir&s;t was, For that the <HI>Prince</HI> having &s;ent to me two or three times to tell me that he had a great de&s;ire to &s;ee what I carry'd to the King, I con&s;tantly refus'd to &s;hew him, alledging for my excu&s;e, that I had Orders from his Maje&s;ty not to expo&s;e 'em to any but him&s;elf. Moreover, I ob&s;erv'd that this <HI>Prince</HI> is not altogether &s;o much a Subject to the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> nor &s;o &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to his Orders, as the

other Viceroys and Governours of his Empire, be&s;ides that the <HI>Georgians</HI> are very perfidious and covetous of other Mens Goods. I was therefore fearful le&s;t, if I &s;hould &s;hew the high-priz'd Jewels which I had, their Beauty and their Value might tempt him to take 'em from me, or that other people might Murder me for the Lucre of &s;uch a Booty. And this was one Con&s;ideration that prevented me from &s;hewing 'em.</P>
<P>The Second Cau&s;e of my Di&s;truct was this, That the <HI>Ca|puchins,</HI> to do me the more Honour, out of a de&s;ign to bring a greater Reputation to them&s;elves, had &s;et me out for a Per|&s;on that was very Rich and Powerful, &s;o that there ran a Re|port over all the City, that I had immen&s;e Sums. Which made the Cu&s;tomer look about me; &s;o that he demanded great Duties from me. But tho&s;e Duties were not the thing that di|&s;turb'd me, for by the Kings Patent I was fully di&s;charg'd. But I was afraid le&s;t the Prince would make u&s;e of that pretence to view my Goods whether I would or no. And this was that which encreas'd my Fears, and made me in&s;i&s;t upon having an Officer to conduct me. For my rea&s;on told me, that &s;uch a Pro|vi&s;ion would render the <HI>Viceroy</HI> more re&s;pon&s;ible for any Acci|dent that &s;hould befall me, and that my Guide would &s;ecure both my Per&s;on and my Goods. And indeed the greate&s;t part of my Fears were di&s;&s;ipated when I &s;aw my &s;elf quite free of <HI>Tefflis;</HI> for then I began to conceive good hopes of all the re&s;t of my Journey. That Day I travell'd two Leagues through a Pa&s;&s;age of the little Mountain that lies to the South of the City; and lay at a Great Village call'd <HI>Sogan-Lou,</HI> or the <HI>Place of Onions,</HI> built upon the River <HI>Cur.</HI></P>
<P>The 1&s;t of <HI>March,</HI> I travell'd Eight Leagues in a fair Plain, where the Road was indifferently &s;treight, leading to the North-Ea&s;t. Within three Hours I came to a Village con&s;i&s;ting of about a Hunderd and Fifty Hou&s;es, call'd <HI>Cupri-Kent,</HI> or the <HI>Village of the Bridge.</HI> Becau&s;e there is a very fair Bridge that &s;tands not far from it, built upon a River call'd <HI>Tabadi.</HI> This Bridge is plac'd between two Mountains, &s;eperated only by the River, and &s;upported by Four Arches, unequal both in their Heighth and Breadth. They are built after an Irregular form, in regard of two great Heaps of a Rock that &s;tand in the River, upon which they have laid &s;o many Arches. Tho&s;e at the two ends are hollow'd on both &s;ides, and &s;erve to lodge Pa&s;&s;engers; wherein they have made to that purpo&s;e little <HI>Chambers</HI> and Por|tico's with every one a Chimney. The Arch in the middle of the River is hollow'd quite through from one part to the other,
<PB N="240" REF="136">
with two Chambers at the Ends, and two large Balconies co|ver'd, where they take the cool Air in the Summer with great delight, and to which there is a De&s;cent of two pair of Stairs hewn out of the Rock. Adjoyning to this fair Bridge there &s;tands an Inn now ready to go to decay. However the Structure is Magnificent, having &s;everal Chambers with every one a Balcony that looks out upon the Water. Neither is there a fairer Bridge, nor a more beautiful Inn in all <HI>Geor|gia.</HI></P>
<P>The Second, we Travell'd Nine Leagues among Mountains very rugged and difficult to cro&s;s. So that we were twelve Hours ere we got to our Journeys end, though we Travell'd at a good rate. About Sun-&s;et we arriv'd at a great Village call'd <HI>Melik-Kent,</HI> or the Royal Village, built upon a point of one of tho&s;e High Mountains.</P>
<P>The Third, we Travell'd eight Leagues i' the Mountains where we were much perplex'd, and where we did nothing but a&s;cend and de&s;cend. At length we lay at a Village as big as <HI>Melik-Kent.</HI></P>
<P>The Fourth, we Travell'd only three Leagues: and before Noon we came to a Town that con&s;i&s;ted of about Three Hun|derd Hou&s;es, call'd <HI>Dily-jan.</HI> It is &s;eated upon a River call'd <HI>Acal&s;tapha,</HI> at the Foot of a High and Dreadful Mountain, which together with the re&s;t that we pa&s;s'd the preceding days, was a part of Mount <HI>Taurus.</HI> There was every where great plenty of Water, and here and there &s;ome Plains that were but &s;mall, but very fertile. The Goodne&s;s of the Soyl thereabout is not to be imagin'd; nor the Number of Villages that are to be &s;een on every &s;ide. There are &s;everal that &s;tand &s;o high-rais'd upon the points of the Rocks, that you can hard|ly have a &s;ight of 'em. The mo&s;t part are inhabited by <HI>Geor|gian</HI> and <HI>Armenian</HI> Chri&s;tians, but not intermix'd. Tho&s;e Peo|ple having &s;uch an inveterate Antipathy one again&s;t the other, that they cannot live together, nor in the &s;ame Villages. In all the&s;e Mountains are neither Inns nor publick Hou&s;es: how|ever, Travellers are lodg'd in the Countrymens Hou&s;es very conveniently, where there is plenty both of Meat and Drink. For my part I wanted nothing, for my Guide rode &s;till be|fore when we were got about half way; &s;o that when I came to the Village, I &s;till found a large Chamber, empty Stables, a good Fire, and Supper ready. The fir&s;t days Journey I would have paid my Landlord, but my Guide would not per|mit me, telling me, 'Twas not the Cu&s;tom, and that I &s;hould
<PB N="241" REF="136">
rather give Him what I intended the Man of the Hou&s;e. Which was the rea&s;on, that the next Days, I only caus'd &s;omething to be given in private to the People where I Lodg'd. And indeed 'tis very good Travelling with the&s;e Guides: for they cau&s;e yee to be diligently attended. All Night long my Cham|ber was guarded by the People of the Village who kept Watch, as well in Obedience to the Commands which were laid up|on 'em, as for my Security, though there was no danger to be fear'd.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t part of the Hou&s;es of the&s;e Villages are in truth no more then Caverns: For they are hollow places made in the Earth. The re&s;t are built of great Beams of Timber up to the Roof, which is made like a Terra&s;s, and cover'd with <HI>Turf.</HI> Only they leave a hole open in the middle, to let in the Light, and let out the Smoak: which hole they &s;top up as they plea&s;e them&s;elves. Which &s;ort of Caverns have this Con|venience, that they are very warm in the Winter, and cool in the Summer: nor is it an ea&s;ie thing for Thieves to break in|to 'em.</P>
<P>The Borough of <HI>Dily-jan,</HI> and all the Country round about for &s;ix Leagues di&s;tance to the North and South, and very far to the Ea&s;t and We&s;t, belongs to <HI>Kam&s;hi-Can;</HI> and is call'd the <HI>Country of Ca&s;ac.</HI> It holds of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and depends upon that Kingdom after the &s;ame manner as <HI>Georgia,</HI> that is to &s;ay, it is always Govern'd by its own Natural Princes from Father to Son. <HI>Abas</HI> the Great &s;ubdu'd it, at the &s;ame time that he Con|quer'd <HI>Georgia.</HI> The Inhabitants of <HI>Ca&s;ac</HI> are Mountaineers, &s;tout and fierce: Originally de&s;cended from tho&s;e <HI>Co&s;aques</HI> that inhabit the Mountains to the North-Ea&s;t of the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea.</P>
<P>The Fifth, we Travell'd five Leagues over that dreadful Mountain, already &s;pok'n of. There are two Leagues from the Town of <HI>Dily-jan,</HI> which &s;tands at the very Foot of the Hill to the Top, another of even Ground to the Top of all, and two Leagues of De&s;cent again. A tedious Days Journey, which I thought would have kill'd me. For I was troubl'd with a terrible Dy&s;entery, which forc'd me to alight altoge|ther; and then two Men held me up as I went, and a third lead my Hor&s;e. The Mountain is mo&s;t dreadfully laden with Snow, there being nothing el&s;e to be &s;een at the Top, nei|ther Tree nor Plant. The Road al&s;o lay through a narrow Path of Snow, hard'nd by the Feet of Hor&s;es and Travellers: &s;o that if they did but &s;lip their Feet out of the Path, they
<PB N="242" REF="137">
&s;unk up to the Belly in the loo&s;er Snow. Nor is there any pa&s;&s;ing over this Mountain when the Snow-falls or when the Wind blows, for then the print of the Feet is lo&s;t and it is impo&s;&s;ible to find the way. Which is the lo&s;s of many People and Bea&s;ts every Year. Nor does this Snow ever melt, the Mountain being continually cover'd with it.</P>
<P>It &s;eparates <HI>Georgia</HI> from <HI>Armenia:</HI> and I was no &s;ooner over it, but I found a Country quite of another Form and Fa&s;hion. For whereas on the other &s;ide there was nothing to be &s;een but very high Mountains, and &s;ome few &s;mall Plains between 'em, and a Woody Country very well Peopl'd, here on this &s;ide we &s;aw &s;pacious Plains, with little Hillocks cover'd alike with Snow, bare of all &s;ort of VVood, but what was planted about the Villages. VVe lodg'd at <HI>Kara Phe&s;hi&s;h,</HI> a great Bo|rough &s;eated at the Foot of the Mountain which we cro&s;s'd over, and upon the Banks of the River <HI>Zengui.</HI> VVhich Ri|ver waters one part of <HI>Armenia</HI> the Greater.</P>
<P>In making the Geographical De&s;cription of the Country as I pa&s;s'd along, I never mind any Author whether Ancient or Modern, finding 'em all &s;o oppo&s;ite one to another, and al|together dark and confus'd. VVhich was the &s;ame thing that <HI>Strabo</HI> &s;aid of the Authors that preceded him; and whoever will take the pains to compare tho&s;e that have follow'd him, either with the Ancients or among them&s;elves, will be of the &s;ame Opinion. As for example in <HI>Caldea</HI> or <HI>A&s;&s;yria,</HI> which at pre&s;ent they extend almo&s;t to the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea, though <HI>Herodotus, Pliny, Strabo, Ptolomy,</HI> and the other mo&s;t Cele|brated Ancient Geographers enclo&s;e it between the <HI>De&s;ert</HI> of <HI>Arabia</HI> and <HI>Me&s;opotamia.</HI></P>
<P>I have al&s;o ob&s;erv'd one thing in the Government of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> which has made me &s;ince believe, that although Authors have &s;et different Bounds and Limits to the Countries, yet that they might have all written very true and ju&s;tly, and as Things &s;tood in their Times, when the Governments were enlarg'd, or confin'd within narrower Bounds, as the Supreme Gover|nor plea&s;es, or as nece&s;&s;ity requires; for then the Province that gives the Name to the Government, has not the &s;ame Limits, nor ob&s;erves the &s;ame Situation as before. And therefore I will mark out the Extent and Situation of the Country where I pa&s;s'd, as I found 'em; and if I mu&s;t follow the Ancient Authors, it &s;hall be only tho&s;e of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Geography.</P>
<P>Some there are among 'em who divide <HI>Armenia</HI> into Three parts. The fir&s;t which they call properly by that Name, the
<PB N="243" REF="137">
&s;econd which they call <HI>Turcomannia,</HI> and the third to which they give the Name of <HI>Georgia.</HI> But the greater Number di|vide it only into two parts, the Upper and the Lower. The Lower which is &s;ometimes call'd the <HI>Le&s;&s;er,</HI> &s;ometimes the <HI>We|&s;tern,</HI> but generally the Le&s;&s;er, is under the Dominion of the <HI>Turks.</HI> The Upper, which they &s;ometimes call the <HI>Ea&s;tern,</HI> &s;ometimes the Great, but u&s;ually the Greater, is a Province of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> To the &s;mall or <HI>Le&s;&s;er Armenia</HI> they a&s;&s;ign for Bounds, the <HI>Great Armenia</HI> to the <HI>Ea&s;t, Syria</HI> to the <HI>South,</HI> the <HI>Black-Sea</HI> to the <HI>We&s;t, Cappadocia</HI> to the <HI>North,</HI> and they place the <HI>Great Armenia</HI> between <HI>Me&s;opotamia, Georgia, Media</HI> and <HI>Ar|menia</HI> the <HI>Le&s;s.</HI> Which Situation agrees in part with that of the Ancient Geographers, who enclo&s;e <HI>Armenia</HI> the Le&s;s, be|tween <HI>Cappadocia</HI> and <HI>Euphrates,</HI> and <HI>Armenia</HI> the Greater, be|tween <HI>Euphrates</HI> and <HI>Tygris.</HI> But it no way corre&s;ponds with that of &s;ome Authors, as is to be &s;een, who put <HI>Syria,</HI> the Shoars of the <HI>Mediterranean Sea,</HI> and the Banks of the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> in <HI>Armenia,</HI> of which they make <HI>Ede&s;&s;a</HI> to be the Capital City. Neither do Authors differ le&s;s about the Denomination of this Country; while &s;ome derive the Name of <HI>Armenia</HI> from <HI>Ar|menius</HI> a <HI>Rhodian,</HI> or <HI>The&s;&s;alian.</HI> Others with far more Rea|&s;on from <HI>Aram,</HI> which might have &s;ome Relation to the He|brew word <HI>Ram</HI> which &s;ignifies High or Elevated, either be|cau&s;e the Country lyes High, and for that &s;everal of the Ea|&s;tern Mountains make a part of it, or el&s;e becau&s;e it fell as his &s;hare to <HI>Aram</HI> the Grand-Child of <HI>Noah;</HI> who therefore call'd it by his own Name. And therefore <HI>Hayton</HI> who was King of the Country derives this Name of <HI>Armenia</HI> from <HI>Aram-Noah.</HI> But how uncertain &s;oever this Etymology may be, I had rather give credit to it, then to another Story which he reports of <HI>Armenia,</HI> that is to &s;ay, that it was the Province where <HI>Salma|na&s;&s;ar</HI> planted the Greate&s;t part of the Jews which he took Pri&s;oners in the Conque&s;t of <HI>Pale&s;tine</HI> The Holy Scripture, where ere it has occa&s;ion to mention it calls <HI>Armenia, Ararat.</HI> Certainly it is one of the mo&s;t lovely and mo&s;t Fertile Countries of <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> It is water'd by Seaven large Rivers, which is the rea&s;on in my opinion that obliges the mo&s;t part of the Inter|preters of the Old Te&s;tament to place the Terre&s;trial Paradi&s;e in this Province. However it were, <HI>Armenia</HI> is renown'd for &s;e|veral other Famous Accidents and Events. There is not any other Country wherein were fought &s;o many Bloody Battels nor with greater Numbers on both &s;ides. It has had particular Kings of its own at &s;everal times; though they could not pre|&s;erve
<PB N="244" REF="138">
their Dominion, while as Hi&s;tories a&s;&s;ure us, all the mo&s;t Eminent Captains that ever invaded <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> &s;ubdu'd it under their Subjection in their &s;everal turns. It was the Theatre of the la&s;t Wars between the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ians;</HI> while the <HI>Turks</HI> fought to have had it all entire; though at length they were content to &s;hare it with the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> yet not &s;o but that they have had the greate&s;t part.</P>
<P>The 6th, I continu'd my Journey, half dead as I was with Cold and a Dy&s;entery. But the hopes I was in to meet at <HI>E|rivan</HI> with all nece&s;&s;ary Accommodations for my Cure, made me ha&s;ten thither, notwith&s;tanding all the Pains that I felt. So that we Travell'd Four Leagues and arriv'd at <HI>Bichni</HI> a con&s;ide|rable Village &s;eated at the Foot of a Mountain upon the River <HI>Zengui.</HI> We lodg'd at a fair <HI>Armenian</HI> Mona&s;tery built be|tween the Village and the Mountain. This Mona&s;tery is an Ancient Foundation between Eight and Nine Hunderd Years &s;tanding. The Cloi&s;ter is built after the Fa&s;hion of the Coun|try, encompa&s;s'd with High and Thick Walls of Free Stone. Near to the Mona&s;tery are to be &s;een the Ruines of Towers, Ca&s;tles, and Ramparts in &s;o great a Number, that it renders very probable what the People of the Country report, that <HI>Bichni</HI> has been one of the &s;trong Places of <HI>Armenia.</HI> I lodg'd in the Convent, where the Monks receiv'd me with great Ci|vility, and put me into the faire&s;t Apartiment they had, only I could by no means prevaile with 'em to let me have a Fowl to make a little Broth, becau&s;e it was their time of Lent. So that my Guide was forc'd to u&s;e his Authority, even to the holding up his Cane to procure me a few Eggs. Toward the Evening I had a de&s;ire to Drink &s;ome Coffee, which my Guide brought me boyl'd with a little Sugar; and of that I Drank Four &s;mall Gla&s;&s;es as hot as I could; which done, I lay'd me down well cover'd before a good Fire. To which feeble Re|medy it pleas'd GOD to give &s;o great a Ble&s;&s;ing, that I &s;lept without Interruption all that Night, and the next Morning found my &s;elf wholly cur'd of this Di&s;temper.</P>
<P>The 7th, I &s;et forward by break of Day, after I had made a &s;mall Pre&s;ent to the Mona&s;tery. All that day we travell'd over Plains all cover'd with Snow as the day before. And indeed it is not only trouble&s;ome but very dangerous to travel through tho&s;e deep Snows. The Mi&s;chief is that the Beams of the Sun which lye all the day long upon it, mole&s;t the Eyes and Face with &s;uch a &s;corching Heat, as very much weak'ns the Sight, whatever Remedy a Man can apply; by

wearing as the People of the Country do, a thin Handkerchief of Green or Black Silk, which no way abates the Annoyance. Then another Danger there is, that when Travellers meet, there ari&s;es a Di&s;pute, who &s;hall be forc'd into the Snow. For the Road is &s;o narrow that two Hor&s;es cannot go abrea&s;t: &s;o that if equal Parties meet, they fall to blows for the way, and the weake&s;t &s;ide is forc'd to yield. Then they unlade their Hor&s;es, and drive 'em into the Snow, where they &s;ink up to the Bel|lies to give pa&s;&s;age to the others. But my Guide con&s;train'd all that we met to unlade, which was to me a very great Ea&s;e. Thus we pa&s;s'd through many Villages and Towns, and Night coming on we arriv'd at <HI>Erivan.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis a hard matter to de&s;cribe the true Road from <HI>Tefflis</HI> to this City, in regard of the many Turnings and Windings, and the frequent Occa&s;ions to a&s;cend and de&s;cend the greate&s;t part of the way. Only I ob&s;erv'd that we &s;till kept on to the South-We&s;t. From <HI>Tefflis</HI> to <HI>Erivan</HI> it is reck'ned to be about Eight and Forty Leagues.</P>
<P><HI>Erivan</HI> is a great City, but ill-favour'd and dirty; and of which the Vineyards and Gardens make the greate&s;t part, there being no Ornamental Buildings within it. It is &s;eated in a Plain encompa&s;s'd with Mountains on every &s;ide. Two Rivers run by it, <HI>Zengui</HI> to the North-We&s;t, and <HI>Queurk-bou|lak</HI> to the South-We&s;t. Which <HI>Queurk-boulak</HI> &s;ignifies Forty Fountains; the River being &s;aid to ri&s;e from &s;o many Springs; nor does it run a long cour&s;e. But we &s;hall &s;ay no more of the City, nor of its Figure, the Draught being &s;ufficient to give an Idea of it.</P>
<P>The Fortre&s;s it &s;elf may pa&s;s for a &s;mall City. It is of an Oval Form, being about Four Thou&s;and Paces in Compa&s;s, and containing Eight Hunderd Hou&s;es, inhabited only by Na|tural <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI> 'Tis true, the <HI>Armenians</HI> have Shops therein, where they Work and Trade all the Day long; but in the Evening they &s;hut up their Shops, and return Home to their Hou&s;es. This Fortre&s;s is &s;urrounded with three Walls of Earth, or Bricks made of Clay with Battlements, flank'd with Towers, and &s;trengthen'd with very narrow Ramparts, according to the Ancient Manner, and therefore without any Regularity, after the Ea&s;tern Fa&s;hion. And indeed it had been a hard matter to have made a Regular Fortification in a place that would not admit of it, in regard the Fortre&s;s extends it &s;elf to the North-Ea&s;t upon the &s;ide of a dreadful Precipice, broad and &s;teep, above a Hunderd Fathom to the bottom, where the River
<PB REF="141">
<PB N="246" REF="142">
runs. And therefore this &s;ide being impregnable and inacce&s;|&s;ible, has no other Fortifications then Terra&s;&s;es furni&s;h'd with Artillery. However, a Gari&s;on of no le&s;s then Two Thou|&s;and Men is always kept in pay for the Guard of this Fortre&s;s; which has as many Gates as Walls, all plated with Iron, and &s;trengthen'd with Port-Cullices and Courts of Guard fortify'd. The Governor of the Provinces Palace being within the Ca|&s;tle, &s;tands upon the Brink of the Precipice already men|tion'd; and is very fair, very &s;pacious, and very delightful in Summer.</P>
<P>Near to the Fortre&s;s, about a Thou&s;and Paces di&s;tant up|on the North-&s;ide, &s;tands a Hillock which Commands it, the upper part being fortify'd with a double Wall, and planted with great Guns, and capable to lodge Two Hunderd Men. This little Fort is call'd <HI>Queut&s;hy-cala.</HI></P>
<P>The City &s;tands about Cannon-Shot di&s;tance from the For|tre&s;s; but the &s;pace between is fill'd up with Hou&s;es and Mar|ket-Places; but &s;uch pitiful thin Structures, that they may be all remov'd away in one day.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal Churches in this City; of which the prin|cipal are the Epi&s;copal See, call'd <HI>Ircou-ye-rize,</HI> or <HI>Two Faces</HI> and <HI>Catovike.</HI> Which two Churches have &s;tood ever &s;ince the Raign of the two la&s;t Kings of <HI>Armenia.</HI> The others were Erected &s;ince; and are &s;mall, &s;unk deep in the Earth, and not unlike &s;o many <HI>Cata-Combs,</HI> or Burying-places.</P>
<P>Near the Epi&s;copal See &s;tands an old Tower built of Free-Stone, of which you &s;ee the Draught in the Sculpture. I ne|ver could learn when it was Erected, nor by whom, nor for what u&s;e. Yet there are In&s;criptions on the out&s;ide, of which the Character re&s;embles the <HI>Armenian,</HI> but the <HI>Armenians</HI> could not read it. The Workman&s;hip of this Tower is all of An|tique-Work, and &s;ingular for its Architecture, as may appear by the Figure. The in&s;ide is all empty and naked: but on the out&s;ide and round about it &s;everal Ruines &s;o di&s;pos'd, as if formerly there had been &s;ome Cloy&s;ter there, and that this Tower had &s;tood in the mid&s;t of it.</P>
<P>Before it appears a great Market-Place, and not far from it an old Mo&s;que built of Brick, but very much decay'd. They call it <HI>Deuf-Sultans</HI> Mo&s;que, from the Name of the Founder. Three Hunderd Paces di&s;tant is to be &s;een the <HI>Grand Maydan,</HI> which is the Name in <HI>A&s;ia</HI> for all the Grand Market-Places. This in <HI>Erivan</HI> is four-&s;quare, Four Hunderd Paces in Dia|meter, and planted round with Trees: being the place ap|pointed

for all manner of Exerci&s;es both for Hor&s;e and Foot, as <HI>Carou&s;els,</HI> Racing, VVre&s;tling, and Managing of Hor&s;es for VVar.</P>
<P>There are many Baths in the City and in the Fortre&s;s, and many Inns: of which the faire&s;t &s;tands about Five Hunderd Paces from the Ca&s;tle, built by the Governor of <HI>Armenia</HI> &s;ome few Years ago. The Portal is Eighty Paces in depth, and forms a fair Gallery, full of Shops, where are &s;old all manner of Stuffs. The Body of the Structure is &s;quare, containing three great Lodgings, and Sixty &s;mall ones, with fair Stables, and very large Warehou&s;es. Before it lies a Market-Place &s;ur|rounded with Shops, where are to be &s;old all &s;orts of Provi|&s;ion for the Belly; and upon one &s;ide a fair Mo&s;que and two Coffee-Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>The Elevation of <HI>Erivan</HI> is in 40 Deg. 15 Min. The Lon|gitude in 78 Deg. 20 Min. The Air is good, but a little thick and cold: and the Winter la&s;ts long; &s;o that &s;ometimes it will Snow in <HI>April.</HI> Which con&s;trains the Country-People to bury their Vines in the Winter, and never to dig 'em up again till the Spring. The Country is delightful and very fertil. The Earth produces her Fruits in great Plenty, e&s;peci|ally Wine, which is very good and cheap. The <HI>Armenians</HI> al&s;o have a Tradition, That <HI>Noah</HI> planted a Vineyard near to <HI>Erivan,</HI> and &s;ome there are who pretend to know the Place, and &s;hew it about a &s;mall League from the City. The Soyl produces all &s;orts of Provi&s;ion, which is therefore &s;old at a ve|ry low rate. The two Rivers that run by the &s;ide of it, and the Lake of which we &s;hall take an occa&s;ion to &s;peak, furni&s;h the City with Excellent Fi&s;h, and among the re&s;t with Trouts and Carps that are wonderfully good, and famous all over the Ea&s;t; of which I have &s;een &s;ome that have been three Foot long: And then for Fowl, no place in the World where Par|tridges are more plentiful.</P>
<P>The Lake of <HI>Erivan</HI> lies three &s;mall days Journeys off to the North-We&s;t; by the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> call'd <HI>Deria-Shirin,</HI> or the Sweet-Lake; by the <HI>Armenians, Kiagar-couni-&s;ou,</HI> which &s;ignifies the &s;ame thing: and the rea&s;on why it is &s;o call'd is from the ex|traordinary &s;weetne&s;s of the Water. It is Five and Twenty Leagues in Circuit, and very deep; affording nine &s;orts of Fi&s;h which are there tak'n; the faire&s;t Trouts and Carps which are eaten at <HI>Erivan,</HI> being caught in this Lake. There is a &s;mall I&s;land in the middle of it; where &s;tands a Mona&s;tery built about 600 Years ago, of which the Prior is an Arch|bi&s;hop,

who takes upon him the Title of Patriarch, refu&s;ing to acknowledge the <HI>Grand Patriarch.</HI> Our Maps take no Cog|nizance of this Lake; a wonderful thing to me, that among all our Travellers into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> not one &s;hould make any men|tion of it. By which defect it may be judg'd that tho&s;e Au|thors were little curious after the Rarities of the Countries through which they pa&s;s'd. The River <HI>Zengui</HI> takes its &s;ource from this Lake, and cro&s;&s;ing one part of <HI>Armenia,</HI> meets with the River <HI>Araxes</HI> near the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, into which at length they both di&s;charge them&s;elves.</P>
<P><HI>Erivan,</HI> by the report of the <HI>Armenians,</HI> is the mo&s;t Anci|ent inhabited place in the World. For they affirm that <HI>Noah</HI> and all his Family dwelt there, both before the Deluge, and after he de&s;cended from the Mountain where the Ark re&s;ted; and that here was al&s;o the Terre&s;trial Paradi&s;e. But all this is a Story without Foundation, and reported by Per&s;ons equally ignorant and vain-glorious. Some Authors there are who af|firm <HI>Erivan</HI> to be the City which <HI>Ptolomy</HI> calls <HI>Terva,</HI> and makes to be the Capital City of <HI>Armenia.</HI> Others hold it to be the Royal <HI>Artaxate.</HI> The Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Turks</HI> calls it <HI>Eritze:</HI> but that of <HI>Armenia,</HI> which is to be &s;een in the famous Mona&s;tery of the Three Churches, a&s;&s;erts, That this City was formerly call'd <HI>Vagar-Shapat,</HI> which &s;ignifies (word for word) <HI>Vagar</HI>'s City. But that which renders the&s;e Pieces of Anti|quity very much &s;u&s;pected, is, That the &s;ame Hi&s;tory, &s;peak|ing of the Etymology of <HI>Erivan,</HI> derives it from an <HI>Armenian</HI> word which &s;ignifies <HI>To &s;ee;</HI> and &s;ays farther, that that &s;ame Name was giv'n to this City, becau&s;e the Territory belonging to it was the fir&s;t Place that <HI>Noah</HI> di&s;cover'd when he de&s;cend|ed from the Mountain of <HI>Ararat.</HI> And yet it is well known that the <HI>Armenian</HI> is a Modern Language, that has not been in u&s;e above the&s;e Seven Hunderd Years. Nor do we find any thing in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Hi&s;tory concerning the Original of <HI>Erivan.</HI> Neither do I believe it to have been built before the Conque&s;ts of the <HI>Arabs</HI> in <HI>Armenia;</HI> and that which makes me believe it is this, for that neither in the City, nor in any parts adjoyning round about it, there are any Foot&s;teps of great Antiquity to be &s;een. The <HI>Turks</HI> became Ma&s;ters of it in the Year 1582. and built the Fortre&s;s &s;till to be &s;een. The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> retook it in the Year 1604. and fortify'd it again&s;t the Violence of Can|non-Shot.

<P>Two Leagues from <HI>Erivan</HI> &s;tands that famous Mona&s;tery of the <HI>Three Churches;</HI> the Sanctuary of the <HI>Armenian</HI> Chri&s;tians, if I may pre&s;ume &s;o to call it, and the place to which they pay their greate&s;t Devotion. I have caus'd a Draught to be made of it at large, and have added a Geometrical Ground-Plot, and a &s;mall Sketch of the out&s;ide of the Principal Church, to give a more di&s;tinct De&s;cription of the Mona&s;tery, and more ea&s;ie for Apprehen&s;ion. The <HI>Armenians</HI> call it <HI>Ecs-Miazin,</HI> or the <HI>De&s;cent of the only begotten Son,</HI> or the <HI>Only be|gotten Son is de&s;cended.</HI> Which Name, &s;ay they, was given to this Place, becau&s;e <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> &s;hew'd him&s;elf vi&s;ibly in this place to St <HI>Gregory,</HI> who was the fir&s;t Patriarch of it. The <HI>Mahometans</HI> call it <HI>&V;t&s;h-Cli&s;&s;ie,</HI> or the <HI>Three Churches;</HI> for that be&s;ides the Church belonging to the Convent, there are two others adjoyning to it. The fir&s;t and the principal, call'd <HI>Ecs-Miazin,</HI> is a very &s;ub&s;tantial and dark Structure, all built of large Free-Stone. The Pila&s;ters, which are Seventy two Foot high, are mi&s;hapen Piles of Stone; as are al&s;o the <HI>Duomo,</HI> and the Roofs. On the inner &s;ide are to be &s;een no Ornaments either of Sculpture or Painting. The Chappels &s;tand upon the Ea&s;t-&s;ide; be&s;ides three at the lower end of the Church. Of which the middlemo&s;t is very &s;pacious, with an Altar of Stone after the manner of the Ea&s;tern Chri&s;tians very well adorn'd. But there is not any Altar in tho&s;e upon the Sides, only one &s;erves for a Ve&s;try, and the other for a Trea&s;ury. In the Ve|&s;try the Monks that belong to the Place &s;hew yee &s;everal Pieces of Church-Furniture, very beautiful and rich, as Cro&s;&s;es, Gold Chalices, Lamps and Candle&s;ticks of Silver of an extra|ordinary bigne&s;s. The chiefe&s;t part of which Wealth was the Munificence of Papal Liberality; and Te&s;timonies of <HI>Rome</HI>'s Credulity, as well as of <HI>Armenian</HI> Di&s;&s;imulation. There are al&s;o to be &s;een in the Trea&s;ury, &s;everal Shrines of Silver and Vermillion Gilt. The principal Relicks belonging to the Place, by the report of the Monks that have 'em in keeping, are the upper part of the Body of St. <HI>Rep&s;ima,</HI> an Arm and a Thigh of St. <HI>Caiana;</HI> an Arm of St. <HI>Gregory,</HI> Sirnam'd the <HI>Illuminator,</HI> becau&s;e he Converted <HI>Armenia;</HI> a Rib of St. <HI>James</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> a Finger of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> and two Fingers of St. <HI>John</HI>

the <HI>Bapti&s;t.</HI> Who&s;e Body, as the <HI>Monks</HI> of this Mona&s;tery affirm, lies in a Church belonging to a Convent of their Order near to <HI>Erzerum:</HI> That <HI>Leontius,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Cae&s;area,</HI> gave it to their fir&s;t <HI>Patriarch,</HI> and that after it had lain Three Hun|derd and Fifty Years at <HI>Echs-Miazin,</HI> it was Tran&s;lated to the place where they &s;ay it now lies. But the <HI>Monks</HI> of <HI>Echs-Miazin,</HI> who are the great Doctors of the <HI>Armenians,</HI> are &s;o ignorant by their own Confe&s;&s;ion in my hearing, that they never heard of tho&s;e Hi&s;tories which relate how that the Body of St. <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI> was burnt to A&s;hes by the Command of <HI>Julian</HI> the Apo&s;tate. I omit to &s;ay any thing of tho&s;e other Relicks which they pretend to have in their Trea&s;ury, as be|ing the Relicks of Saints very little known to this part of the World. I &s;hall only therefore add this farther, That the <HI>Monks</HI> belonging to the Convent affirm for a great Truth, That once they had the two Nails that fa&s;ten'd the Sacred Hands of <HI>JESUS CHRIST</HI> to the Cro&s;s, which are &s;till pre&s;erv'd, the one at <HI>Diar-Bekre,</HI> the other in <HI>Georgia;</HI> and that <HI>Abas</HI> the <HI>Great</HI> took out of their Trea&s;ury the true Lance, and the Seamle&s;s Garment, to enrich the Trea&s;ury of the Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> at <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI></P>
<P>In the middle of the Church &s;tands a large &s;quare Free-Stone, being three Foot in Diameter, and five Foot thick. The <HI>Armenians</HI> a&s;&s;ure us, as an Article of their Faith, That this was the place where St <HI>Gregory</HI> their Apo&s;tle &s;aw <HI>JESUS CHRIST</HI> one <HI>Sunday</HI> in the Evening, while he was at his Prayers, and where he &s;pake to him. They farther a&s;certain us, That <HI>JE|SUS CHRIST</HI> drew round about this Saint with a Beam of Light the De&s;ign of the Church of <HI>Echs-Miazin,</HI> and order'd him to build it according to the Model which he had there drawn. They add, That at the &s;ame time the Earth open'd in that part where the Stone lies, and that <HI>CHRIST</HI> ca&s;t down to Hell through that Hole, all the Devils that were in the Temples of <HI>Armenia,</HI> and utter'd fal&s;e Oracles, and that Saint <HI>Gregory</HI> caus'd the Hole to be cover'd with Marble. They add, That <HI>Abas</HI> the <HI>Great</HI> carry'd away the Marble, and put it into the Royal Trea&s;ury of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and caus'd this Stone to be &s;et up in the Room of it. Concerning which I made a dili|gent Inquiry at <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> nay I ask'd the Superintendents of the Trea&s;ury them&s;elves; but I could not find that They under|&s;tood any thing of it. <HI>Armenian</HI> Tradition tells yee al&s;o of another particular in reference to the Center of this Church, which I &s;hall &s;et down, though as fabulous as the re&s;t, That
<PB N="251" REF="148">
this was the true place, where <HI>Noah</HI> built that Altar, and of|fer'd that Sacrifice, which is mention'd in the Eighth Chapter of <HI>Gene&s;is.</HI></P>
<P>The Great Steeple has been newly rebuilt, containing Six Bells, the bigge&s;t of which weighs 1200 Weight. One of the &s;maller Bells fell down about Forty Years &s;ince, and was never hung up again, for want of Money, as the <HI>Armenians</HI> &s;ay: and indeed it is certain that they are very Poor. The fir&s;t Mona&s;tery of this Church was built by <HI>Nier&s;es</HI> the Twen|ty Ninth Patriarch of <HI>Armenia.</HI> This the <HI>Tartars</HI> ruin'd; and if we may believe the Chronology of the Place, it has been Five times levell'd with the Ground. It is at pre&s;ent built of Brick; the Patriarchs Apartiment lying to the Ea&s;t. There are be&s;ides in the Convent Lodgings for all &s;trangers that come to Vi&s;it it, and for 80 Monks be&s;ide; but u&s;ually there are not above Twelve or Fifteen. And here it is that the Patriarchs of <HI>Armenia</HI> are oblig'd to re&s;ide. But to &s;ay Truth, the Ava|rice, Envy and Ambition with which they are po&s;&s;e&s;s'd in this Age, finds 'em &s;o much bu&s;ine&s;s, that they &s;pend all their time in Rambling over <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Turkey.</HI> This Patriarch has Twenty Bi&s;hopricks under him.</P>
<P>The two other Churches that &s;tand near <HI>Echs-Miazin,</HI> are call'd one St. <HI>Caiana,</HI> and the other St. <HI>Rep&s;ima,</HI> from the Names of two Roman Virgins, who, as they &s;ay, fled into <HI>Ar|menia,</HI> in the time of the Ninth Per&s;ecution, and &s;uffer'd Mar|tyrdom in the &s;ame place where the Churches &s;tand. St. <HI>Cai|ana</HI> &s;tands upon the Right Hand, 700 Paces di&s;tant from the Mona&s;tery. St. <HI>Rep&s;ima</HI> upon the Left, about 2000 Paces off. The&s;e two Churches are half-ruin'd, there having been no Service perform'd in either for a long time.</P>
<P>Within the Territory of <HI>Erivan</HI> which extends above Twen|ty Leagues every way, there are Three and Twenty Con|vents for Men, and Five for Women: but all pitifully Poor and badly kept; the mo&s;t part not having above Five or Six Per&s;ons a piece, who&s;e Penury continually employs 'em in getting a Livelyhood, &s;o that they never perform Holy Duties but upon Holy-days. One of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable is <HI>Cour-Virah,</HI> which in the <HI>Armenian</HI> Language &s;ignifies Literally the <HI>Church upon the Wells:</HI> and therefore this Name is given to this Convent, as being built over a Well, into which, as the <HI>Armenian</HI> Hi|&s;tory relates, St. <HI>Gregory</HI> was thrown, and yet pre&s;erv'd alive, being fed in the &s;ame manner as <HI>Daniel</HI> was fed in the Lyons Den. This Mona&s;tery &s;tands upon the confines of the Ter|ritory

of <HI>Erivan</HI> to the South of <HI>Echs-Miazin:</HI> where the People of the Country report, that the Ruines of <HI>Artaxarte</HI> are al&s;o to be &s;een. Which City they call <HI>Arda&s;hat,</HI> from <HI>Ar|taxerxes,</HI> whom the Ea&s;terns call <HI>Arde&s;hir.</HI> Among the Ruines of which, as they &s;ay, are al&s;o to be &s;een the Ruines of the Palace of <HI>Tyridates,</HI> built about 1300 Years ago. They &s;ay moreover, that there is the Front of a Palace which is not above half Ruin'd, where there &s;till remain four Rows of Columns of Black Marble, every one of Nine Columns, that the&s;e Columns encompa&s;s a great Heap of wrought Pieces of Marble, and that the Columns are of that bigne&s;s, that Three Men can hardly enfold 'em in their Arms. They call the whole place, where this heap of Ruines lies, <HI>Tact-Terdat,</HI> or the Throne of <HI>Tyridates.</HI> I &s;hall forbear to &s;peak of the other Mona&s;teries, or of the particular Stories which the <HI>Armenians</HI> recount concerning 'em, or of the Relicks that are there pre|&s;erv'd; among which they number up the <HI>Veronique,</HI> or the Napkin which a Woman of that Name brought to wipe the Sweat from Chri&s;t's Face: the Bodies of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> and St. <HI>Simon,</HI> which is all meer Idle and ridiculous Fable: for in truth the <HI>Armenian</HI> Tradition has nothing of common Sence. Nor &s;hall I &s;peak any thing of the <HI>Armenian</HI> Belief or Wor&s;hip; for it is well known what they are, as having been for &s;everal Ages wrapt up in the Opinions of the <HI>Monophy&s;ites,</HI> who in the Ea&s;t are call'd <HI>Jacobites,</HI> of which at this day they under&s;tand nothing at all, being altogether drown'd in Ig|norance.</P>
<P>Twelve Leagues from <HI>Erivan</HI> to the Ea&s;t, is to be &s;een the Famous Mountain, where almo&s;t all Men agree that the Ark of <HI>Noah</HI> re&s;ted; though no Body can bring any Solid Proof to make out what they affirm. VVhen the Air is Serene, this Mountain is not to be &s;een at more then the di&s;tance of two Leagues, as High and as Great as it is; and therefore I am apt to believe I have &s;een far higher; and if I am not deceiv'd, that part of <HI>Cauca&s;us</HI> which I cro&s;s'd over, as I Travell'd from the <HI>Black-Sea</HI> to <HI>Akalzik&egrave;,</HI> is higher then this Mountain. The <HI>Turks</HI> call it <HI>Agridag,</HI> the High or Ma&s;&s;ie Mountain; but the <HI>Armenians</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> call it both by the &s;ame Name <HI>Ma&s;is.</HI> VVhich word the <HI>Armenians</HI> derive from <HI>Mas</HI> or <HI>Me&s;ech</HI> the Son of <HI>Aram,</HI> who, as they &s;ay, gave to their Nation both its Original and Denomination. The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> derive it from <HI>Azis,</HI> a VVord which in their Language &s;ignifies <HI>Dear,</HI> or <HI>Dearly-Beloved;</HI> and they will have this Mountain to be &s;o
<PB N="253" REF="149">
call'd, by rea&s;on of the choice that GOD made of it to bear the happy Ark that inclos'd all Mankind. The&s;e are forc'd Etymologies as much as any can be, and &s;uch as we may well compare to the meer Tinkling of Bells. This Mountain is call'd by two other Names in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Books: that is to &s;ay, <HI>Cou-nough,</HI> or the Mountain of <HI>Noah,</HI> and <HI>Sahat-toppous,</HI> or the Happy Hillock. But the Holy Scripture gives it no particular Name, only it &s;ays, That <HI>the Ark re&s;ted upon the Mountain of</HI> Ararat, which is <HI>Armenia.</HI> The&s;e are tho&s;e Moun|tains &s;o famous in the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Authors, which they a&s;&s;ert to be part of Mount <HI>Taurus,</HI> and call by the Names of <HI>Gordian, Cordean, Corduenian, Cardian, Curdi,</HI> and <HI>Carduchi,</HI> every Author altering the word according to the Pronunciati|on of his own Language.</P>
<P>The <HI>Armenians</HI> have a Tradition, That the Ark is &s;till upon the Point, or highe&s;t Top of this Mount <HI>Macis.</HI> They add moreover, That never any Body could a&s;cend to the Place where it re&s;ted; and this they firmly believe upon the Faith of a Miracle, which they &s;ay, happen'd to a certain Monk of <HI>Echs-Miazin,</HI> who&s;e Name was <HI>James,</HI> afterwards Bi&s;hop of <HI>Ni&s;ibis.</HI> They report, That this Monk, po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with the common Opinion that this was the Mountain where the Ark re&s;ted after the Deluge, re&s;olv'd to a&s;cend to the Top, or die in the Attempt; that he got up half way, but could never go any farther; for that after he had clamber'd all the Day long, he was in his Sleep miraculou&s;ly carry'd back to the place from whence he &s;et forward in the Morning. This continu'd a long time; but that at length GOD giving Ear to the Monk's Prayers, was willing to &s;atisfie his De&s;ires in &s;ome mea&s;ure: to which purpo&s;e he &s;ent an Angel to him with a piece of the Ark, with Orders to bid him not toyl him&s;elf any more in vain, for that he had debarr'd from Mortals acce&s;s to the Top of that Mountain. And this is the Tale which they tell; up|on which I &s;hall ob&s;erve two things. Fir&s;t, That it has no Coherence with the Relations of Ancient Authors, as <HI>Jo&s;ephus, Bero&s;us,</HI> or <HI>Nicholas</HI> of <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> who a&s;&s;ure us that the Re|mainders of the Ark were to be &s;een, and that the People took the Pitch with which it was be&s;mear'd as an Antidote again&s;t &s;everal Di&s;tempers. The &s;econd, That whereas it is tak'n for a Miracle, That no Body can get up to the Top, I &s;hould rather take it for a greater Miracle, that any Man &s;hould climb up &s;o high. For the Mountain is altogether uninhabited, and from the Half-way to the Top of all, perpetually cover'd with
<PB N="254" REF="150">
Snow that never melts, &s;o that all the Sea&s;ons of the Year it appears like a Prodigious Heap of nothing but Snow. What I have reported concerning this Mountain, will doubtle&s;s cau&s;e no &s;mall wonder in tho&s;e who have read the Travels of Father <HI>Philip,</HI> a Barefoot <HI>Carmelite,</HI> that he &s;hould undertake to &s;ay that the Terre&s;trial Paradi&s;e lies there <HI>in &s;ome Plain which GOD pre&s;erves from Heat and Cold;</HI> for tho&s;e are the words of his Tran&s;lator. The thought it &s;elf &s;eems to me to be ve|ry plea&s;ant; and I &s;hould have thought he had &s;poke it jocu|larly, did he not relate with an extraordinary &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s &s;e|veral things in the &s;ame Book which are altogether as impro|bable.</P>
<P>At the Foot of the Mountains, in a Village inhabited by Chri&s;tians, &s;tands a Mona&s;tery, call'd <HI>Arakil-Vanc,</HI> or the <HI>Mona&s;tery of the Apo&s;tles;</HI> to which place the <HI>Armenians</HI> pay a very &s;olemn Devotion. For they report that the Bodies of St. <HI>Andrew</HI> and St. <HI>Matthew</HI> were found there, and that the Scull of the Evangeli&s;t is &s;till pre&s;erv'd in the Church belong|ing to the Mona&s;tery.</P>
<P>When I came to <HI>Erivan,</HI> I alighted at the Hou&s;e of an <HI>Ar|menian</HI> of my Acquaintance, who&s;e Name was <HI>Azarias.</HI> He was a Per&s;on extreamly per&s;ecuted by tho&s;e of his own Nati|on, becau&s;e he had been at <HI>Rome</HI> to turn Roman Catholick, and Di&s;ciple to the Colledge for the <HI>Propagation of the Faith,</HI> and for endeavouring to &s;ettle the <HI>Capuchins</HI> at <HI>Erivan.</HI> I found him indi&s;pos'd and in Bed. However he ro&s;e to give Notice of my Arrival; fearing to come into trouble if he de|ferr'd it till the next Morning. To which purpo&s;e he went to Court, but could not &s;ee the Governor who was retir'd in|to the Apartment of the Prince&s;s his Wife: Neverthele&s;s an Eunuch did his Me&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>The Eighth, the Governor &s;ent a Per&s;on to give me a Vi&s;it, and to tell me I was Welcom. Whereupon Mr. <HI>Azarias</HI> un|dertook to go in my behalf and return him my humble Thanks, and withal to let him know who I was. Upon which the Governor &s;hew'd an earne&s;t de&s;ire to &s;ee me as &s;oon as I could, and &s;ome part of the Jewels I had brought along with me. Afterwards he ask'd how many Servants I had, and order'd Mr. <HI>Azarias</HI> to inform him whether I had rather Lodge in the Fortre&s;s, or in the Inn which he had built, and to bring him word &s;peedily. For my part I made choice of the Inn, as well for the Security of the Place, as for that a Man &s;hall ne|ver there want Company, becau&s;e of the great re&s;ort of Mer|chants

thither, be&s;ides that Travellers alighted there every day. Thereupon the Governor order'd me one of the be&s;t Apartments.</P>
<P>The Ninth, I went thither betimes in the Morning, and &s;pent all that day in &s;etling my &s;elf in my Lodging. About Noon one of the Governors Officers brought me an Order from the Steward to &s;end for from the Office Bread, Wine, Meat, Trouts, Fruit, Rice, Butter, Wood, and other Nece&s;&s;ary Pro|vi&s;ions as much as would &s;uffice &s;ix Per&s;ons. The Quantity of every thing is regulated, never augmented nor abated: but the Proportion allow'd for one Per&s;on is &s;o large, that two may well be &s;atisfy'd with it.</P>
<P>The 10th, the Governor &s;ent &s;o earne&s;tly for me to come to him, and bring him part of my Jewels, that I could no lon|ger defer it. I found him in a very large Cabinet or Study, very Decent and very Light. There was al&s;o with him the Head Surveyor of all the Mints of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> who at that time was come to <HI>Erivan,</HI> and four other Lords. He receiv'd me with an Extraordinary Civility, three times told me, I was welcome, and &s;et before me Sweet Meats, and <HI>Aqua Vitae</HI> of <HI>Mo&s;covy.</HI> Pre&s;ently I pre&s;ented him with the Kings Patent, and that of the Grand Ma&s;ter, already mention'd. Of both which he made great accompt, and &s;pent an Hour in Enquiries after <HI>European</HI> News, as well concerning the late Wars, and the pre&s;ent E&s;tate of Chri&s;tendom, as about Arts and Sciences, and what new Di&s;coveries had been made therein. Another Hour he &s;pent in con&s;idering and viewing the Pretious Stones and Jewels which I &s;hew'd him. He gave me to under&s;tand, that among the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Poets, Emraulds of the old Rock were call'd <HI>Emraulds of Egypt,</HI> of which they believ'd there had been a Mine in <HI>Egypt</HI> which was now lo&s;t: and at length, af|ter he had lay'd by what he lik'd him&s;elf, and what he thought would plea&s;e the Prince&s;s his Wife, he &s;tay'd me to dine with him. Dinner being ended, he honour'd me the other half Hour with his Company and then di&s;mi&s;s'd me, commanding an Officer in my hearing to go to the <HI>Caravan&s;erai</HI> and charge the Inn-Keeper to be careful as well for my &s;ecurity, as to give me all Content. And he was moreover &s;o kind as to tell the Officer farther, that he made him my <HI>Memander,</HI> who is as it were a Gentleman-Waiter, and &s;uch as are appointed to attend upon all Per&s;ons of Quality to take care of their Per&s;ons: and the &s;ame Evening he &s;ent me be&s;ides a Pre&s;ent of <HI>Mo&s;covy Aqua Vitae.</HI></P>

This Governor bears the Title of <HI>Becler-Beg,</HI> or <HI>Lord</HI> of <HI>Lords.</HI> For &s;o they call the Deputy Lieutenants of large Go|vernments; to di&s;tingui&s;h 'em from tho&s;e meaner Governours whom they call <HI>Can</HI>'s. He has al&s;o the Title of <HI>Serdar</HI> or Ge|neral of the Army. So that he is one of the Principal Lords of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and one of the mo&s;t Judicious and mo&s;t refin'd Po|liticians in the Kingdom. He is call'd by the Name of <HI>Sephi-Couli-Can;</HI> or the <HI>Duke, the Slave of</HI> Sephi. He enjoy'd one of the mo&s;t Noble Governments of the Empire in the Reign of the Deceas'd King, but through &s;ome Intreague among the Women, he fell into di&s;grace, three Years before the Death of that Prince. The Wife which he has Marry'd is of the Blood Royal by the Mothers &s;ide. And this Prince&s;s it was, who at the beginning of the pre&s;ent Kings Reign, re&s;tor'd her Husband to his Maje&s;ties Favour, from whom in a little time he obtain'd the Government of <HI>Erivan,</HI> the mo&s;t con&s;iderable in the Kingdom, and which yields him the faire&s;t Revenue, no le&s;s then Two and Thirty Thou&s;and Tomans a Year, which are above a Hundred and Twelve Thou&s;and Pounds Sterling. The Fines, Pre&s;ents, and indirect ways to enrich him&s;elf, are worth him Fifty Thou&s;and Pounds more. And doubtle&s;s this Lord is the mo&s;t wealthy and mo&s;t Fortunate of all the King|dom. The King loves him, the Court has a Veneration for him, and his two Sons are the Kings only Favourites: the Peo|ple under his Government Love and re&s;pect him, becau&s;e of his Popularity, his doing Ju&s;tice, and for that he is not &s;o op|pre&s;&s;ive and given to extortion as others. So that he de&s;erves the good Fortune he enjoys; for be&s;ides the&s;e good Qualities, he is Learned, and a great Lover of Arts and Sciences.</P>
<P>The 11th, this Lord &s;ent to invite me to the Nuptials of his Stewards Brother where he was. I found him plea&s;ant and in a very good Humour. For he had receiv'd at the opening of the Gate, an order from the King by a <HI>Coolom-Sha,</HI> who came from <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> in Thirteen Days. This Order related to an affair of great Importance. For &s;everal <HI>Sultans</HI> who are Lords of Coun|trys and Governours of &s;trong Holds, having refus'd to obey his Orders, and having made great complaints again&s;t him to the King and his Mini&s;ters; He on the other &s;ide had ju&s;tifi'd his own Rights and Prerogatives; upon which his Maje&s;ty had given Sentence in his behalf, and had &s;ent him an or|der to Command Obedience. Which Order the <HI>Coolom-Sha</HI> was to &s;ee Executed, and to cau&s;e Satisfaction to be giv'n to the Governour.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="151">
<HI>Coolom-Sha</HI> &s;ignifies the <HI>Kings Slave.</HI> Not but that they who bear this Title are as free, as other the Kings Natural Subjects; but they take it as a Mark of their perfect Devo|tion to their Soveraign, as being that to which they were bred up altogether in their Infancy. For the Imployment of the&s;e <HI>Kings Slaves</HI> in the Court of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> is almo&s;t the &s;ame with that of Gentlemen-U&s;hers; who are Childern of good Quali|ty, employ'd very young in Duty, as well for the Profit which they get by it, as to give 'em a fair Opportunity to make their way to Preferment at Court. There are &s;ome Per&s;ons who &s;end their Sons to the&s;e Imployments at the Age of Five Years. To whom the King a&s;&s;igns Exhibitions according to the Quali|ty of their Family, or the Service which it does the King; for that &s;erves in &s;tead of other Recompence to the Parents. The u&s;ual Exhibition is Twenty <HI>Tomans</HI> a Year, and their Diet; which Twenty <HI>Tomans</HI> make about Seventy Pounds Sterling: And the Diet taken in Money amounts to about Forty Pounds. But the&s;e Exhibitions are frequently enlarg'd proportionably either to the Service which they do the King, or to the Kind|ne&s;s which the King has for their Per&s;ons. For which rea&s;on they are very diligent at Court, and are employ'd in the Exe|cution of all Orders of Importance. They are &s;ent with the Kings Pre&s;ents to the Governors; and out of their Number are taken &s;everal to &s;upply the Vacancies of Officers.</P>
<P>Orders that require Expedition are carry'd Po&s;t. Which Couriers are call'd <HI>T&s;hapars;</HI> a word that comes from a <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> word that &s;ignifies <HI>Galloping,</HI> whence that other word <HI>T&s;apgon,</HI> which &s;ignifies a <HI>Courier.</HI> The&s;e <HI>T&s;hapars</HI> make great ha&s;te, though they do not always meet with Hor&s;es when they have occa&s;ion for 'em: For there are no &s;etl'd Stages in all the <HI>Ea&s;t.</HI> In <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> the Kings and Governors Couriers take Hor&s;es where|ever they find 'em; nay, they have Authority to di&s;mount Travellers upon the High-way: be&s;ides, the Magi&s;trates of the Places through which they pa&s;s, are oblig'd to furni&s;h 'em. However, this is a very mi&s;chievous Cu&s;tom; for &s;uch as have neither the Strength nor the Courage to re&s;i&s;t, are con&s;train'd to give Money to the&s;e Couriers, or to alight and &s;uffer their Hor&s;es to be rid away with, and then to run after 'em if they intend to have 'em again. Neverthele&s;s they dare not meddle with Per&s;ons of Quality, nor the Kings Officers, nor Strangers that are going to the Court, for fear of being call'd to Que|&s;tion. U&s;ually therefore they take up Hor&s;es in the Villa|ges through which they pa&s;s; which they mu&s;t not make
<PB N="258" REF="152">
u&s;e of however above one Days Journey; for which rea&s;on they generally &s;end a <HI>Runner</HI> along with 'em to bring the Hor&s;es back.</P>
<P>The&s;e Couriers are ea&s;ily known by their Habit: For they wear a Cloak ty'd behind 'em; and a little Cloak-bag, which runs through the Pommel, and is fa&s;ten'd to the Saddle-Bow. They carry a Poniard, a Sword, and a Quiver by their Sides, and a Cudgel in their Hands. Their Bows hang about their Shoulders; be&s;ides all which they have a Scarf that comes twice about their Necks, which is brought down Cro&s;s-wi&s;e upon their Backs and Brea&s;ts, and ty'd to their Girdle. When they are de&s;cry'd at a di&s;tance, they who are afraid of being di&s;mounted, flee out of the way and hide them&s;elves, or com|pound for Money, or el&s;e offer 'em their Hor&s;es. The&s;e Cou|riers ride generally two and two, and if they be Per&s;ons of Quality, 'tis the more difficult to get rid of 'em: for they will take no Compo&s;ition; and upon the lea&s;t Re&s;i&s;tance, they ei|ther up with their Battoons, or out with their Swords, well knowing they &s;hall be upheld in what they do; which is a Vio|lence that other Couriers dare not offer.</P>
<P>One of the Principal Extraordinary Expences which the Grandees are con&s;trained to be at, is when the King &s;ends 'em his Orders or Pre&s;ents by a <HI>Coolom-Sha,</HI> or by any other Per&s;on of Quality; for he mu&s;t Cloath him upon his Arrival, and at his Departure he mu&s;t make him a Pre&s;ent an&s;werable to his Imployment, and the Reputation that he bears; be&s;ides that he mu&s;t be well Fea&s;ted and Entertained all the time of his &s;tay. This <HI>Coolom-Sha</HI> that I &s;peak of, co&s;t the Governor of <HI>Erivan,</HI> as I was inform'd, Four Hunderd <HI>Tomans,</HI> which amount to Fourteen Hunderd Pounds be&s;ides Lodging and Diet. Many times the King him&s;elf Taxes the Pre&s;ent which is to be giv'n to the Per&s;on whom he &s;ends, but then the Per|&s;on is oblig'd to pay it pre&s;ently down as a Debt, and to be|&s;tow in Gifts and Large&s;&s;es many times double the Pre&s;ent: in &s;hort, they treat their Me&s;&s;engers according to their Birth, their Merit, and their Credit at Court. This they diligently ob&s;erve, &s;o that when they under&s;tand that a Me&s;&s;enger or his Relations have free Acce&s;s to the King, then they are more free in their Entertainment, to the end he may make an Ad|vantageous Report of his U&s;age, and the Civility &s;hewn him. I remember to this purpo&s;e, in the Year 1669 when the King conferr'd upon the Son of the Prime Mini&s;ter, the Com|mand of Colonel of the Musketeers, his Maje&s;ty &s;ent the Di&s;|patches
<PB N="259" REF="152">
and Habit by his Gold&s;miths, to reward 'em for &s;ome Jewels which they had made to his liking; and that he Tax'd the Pre&s;ent which the Colonel was to give 'em at Three Hun|derd Tomans. Thereupon four of the chief Gold&s;miths car|ry'd the Di&s;patches and the Habit, who in&s;tead of Three Hun|derd, receiv'd 400 Tomans, which make Fourteen Hundred Pounds, and a Pre&s;ent be&s;ides in Stuffs.</P>
<P>I &s;tay'd three Hours at the Wedding, and took my leave after Dinner. The Fea&s;t was kept in a low Dining-Room, rais'd about two Foot, opening into a Court which was Rail'd about like a Tilt-Yard, where &s;everal Wre&s;tlers and Gladiators divertis'd the Company, while the Governor &s;pent his time in looking on, and di&s;cour&s;ing &s;ometimes with the Kings Me&s;&s;en|gers, &s;ometimes with the Company, and &s;ometimes talking with my &s;elf about the news of <HI>Europe.</HI> There were but nine Per&s;ons at the Fea&s;t, among whom the Bridegroom and his God-father were &s;umptuou&s;ly habited, their Turbants being garni&s;h'd with Heron-Tuffs, &s;et with precious Stones. The Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;hold, his other Brothers and his Sons &s;tanding upon their Feet at the lower end of the Room, with &s;everal of the Governours Officers. Every one of the Gue&s;ts were &s;erv'd at their fir&s;t coming, with a Voider of Sweat-Meats Dry and Wet, upon &s;mall Porcelaine Plates; the Voiders them&s;elves being of Wood Painted and Gilt; &s;o that nothing could be &s;een more Neat.</P>
<P>Matrimony in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> is very expen&s;ive, frequently to the Ruin of tho&s;e that engage in it: So that only Per&s;ons of E&s;tates will venture upon it: as for the meaner &s;ort, they are conten|ted with a Concubine or a Slave.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mahometans</HI> that follow the Tenents of <HI>Ali,</HI> take their Wives after three manners, either by way of Purcha&s;e, by way of Hire, or by Marriage. All which three ways they hold to be Lawful. Their Religion allows and teaches 'em this Liber|ty; and the Civil Law acknowledges the Childern Born in any of the&s;e three &s;orts of Wedlock, to be equally Legitimate. So that if a Man have a Son by his Slave, before his Marry'd Wife brings him one, the Son of the Slave is acknowledg'd for the Elde&s;t, and enjoys all the Priviledges of Elder&s;hip to the Exclu&s;ion of the Son of the Lawful Wife, be &s;he a Prin|ce&s;s and of the Blood Royal. And therefore in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> Quality and Nobility de&s;cends only from the Father.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="153">
The Wives, who are Slaves, are call'd <HI>Caniz&egrave;:</HI> of whom the Law allows a Man to have as many as he can maintain. Nor does the Government either Eccle&s;ia&s;tical or Civil take any Cognizance how they are us'd. They that have put 'em to all manner of Drudgery, as they plea&s;e them&s;elves, being not only Ma&s;ters of their Cha&s;tity, but of their Lives. Nor is it a di&s;honour in the Ea&s;t for a Slave to &s;erve her Ma&s;ter as a Wife; but rather a great Honour and the be&s;t Fortune &s;he can arrive at: for when tkey are advanc'd to their Ma&s;ters Bed, they have an Apartiment &s;eperate from the Re&s;t of the Slaves. They are well Clad, allow'd Servants, and a Pen&s;ion; and if they bring Childern, their Allowances are enlarg'd. For then they are no more lookt upon as Slaves, but as the Mothers of the Lawful Heir of the Family.</P>
<P>The hir'd Wives are call'd <HI>Moutaa,</HI> from <HI>Amovad,</HI> which &s;ignifies a Concubine and al&s;o a Servant: of which they may take as many as they plea&s;e, and as long as they plea&s;e for the price they agree upon. At <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> which is the Metropolis of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> tho&s;e that are hand&s;ome and Young may be hir'd for Five and Thirty Pound a Year, be&s;ides Cloaths, Diet and Lodging. Which &s;ort of Marriage is a contract purely Civil. At the end of the Term, if both parties are agreed they may renew the Bargain; and they are at Liberty to break off be|fore the end of the Term, and to put away the hir'd Wife, but then they mu&s;t give the whole Sum contain'd in the Con|tract. Yet cannot the Woman &s;o di&s;mi&s;s'd let out her &s;elf again, nor give her &s;elf to another till Forty Days after her Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion. Which interval is call'd <HI>the Days of Purification.</HI> They who under&s;tand the Ceremonial Law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> may ea&s;ily perceive that the <HI>Mahometans</HI> borrow'd this cu&s;tom from the <HI>Jews,</HI> though new modell'd and alter'd after their own humour. And indeed the Law both of the one and the other agrees in the point of Marriage, and the Behaviour of Men toward Women.</P>
<P>The E&s;pous'd Wives are call'd <HI>Nekaa:</HI> of which the <HI>Maho|metan</HI> Religion allows a Man to Marry Four. Neverthele&s;s they never Marry above one, to avoid the Expence; and be|cau&s;e of the di&s;orders that Multiplicity of Lawful Wives creates in a Hou&s;e. For every one will Command, and their mutual Jealou&s;ie keeps the Hou&s;e in perpetual Confu&s;ion. Therefore People of Quality Marry generally into Families equal in De|gree, if they cannot content them&s;elves with one Woman, which is a Misfortune that never fails to befall 'em, they make
<PB N="261" REF="153">
u&s;e of their Slaves. By that means the Peace of the Family is never di&s;quieted; for the Marry'd Wife is always Lady and Mi&s;tre&s;s. As to other things, whether contented or no, her Relations never take any notice. As for hir'd Wives, &s;eldom any Body takes 'em, but People of mean Condition, or Stran|gers, which they do that they may be rid of 'em when they plea&s;e. The lowe&s;t &s;ort of all never make u&s;e of that Cu|&s;tom, as not being able to pay 'em their Wages. Neither do Per&s;ons of Quality; in regard they &s;corn the Leavings of ano|ther, or that another &s;hould make u&s;e of a Woman who has belong'd to them. But if by chance a Per&s;on of Quality falls in love with a Woman either publick, or not fit to be his Wife, he hires her for Ninety-Nine Years; and by that means he is &s;ure to enjoy her as long as he lives, without Marriage. And they take this cour&s;e, e&s;pecially if They are Marry'd to Women of Quality or Nobly de&s;cended, becau&s;e their Relati|ons would take Them&s;elves to be highly affronted &s;hould They bring into their Hou&s;es Women of mean Birth to be their Com|panions.</P>
<P>In <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> they u&s;ually-Marry by Proxy: becau&s;e the Women are never &s;een by the Men. Which Ceremony is perform'd after this manner. The Kindred of both Parties meet at the Hou&s;e of the Party intended to be the Husband or Bridegroom. Thither they &s;end for a Churchman to make the Contract. Or if the Parties are Per&s;ons of high Quality, then the <HI>Cedre,</HI> who is the chief <HI>Pontiff,</HI> or the <HI>Sheikeli&s;lam,</HI> who is the chief Civil Judge, and is invited for that purpo&s;e. If they are Per|&s;ons of mean Degree, they endeavour to get the <HI>Kazy,</HI> who is the Lieutenant Civil: and if they be very poor People, they &s;end for a <HI>Molla,</HI> or Prie&s;t of the Law. Pre&s;ently the Party Affianc'd in the Company of &s;everal Women repairs to a Cham|ber not far from the place where the People are met, where the Door &s;tands half open, but the Tape&s;try is let down that there is no Body to be &s;een. Then the Proxies of both Parties ri&s;e, and the Proxy for the Party Affianc'd &s;etting him&s;elf again&s;t the Door of the Chamber, and &s;tretching out his Hand, cries out aloud,</P>
<Q><P><HI>I</HI> N. <HI>Authoriz'd Proxy for you</HI> N. <HI>Marry yee to</HI> N. <HI>here pre&s;ent. You &s;hall be his perpetual Wife with &s;uch a prefix'd Dowry accor|ding as you have agreed.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Then the other Proxy thus an&s;wers:</P>
<Q><PB N="262" REF="154">
<P><HI>I</HI> N. <HI>Authoriz'd Proxy for</HI> N. <HI>take thee</HI> N. <HI>in his Name for my perpetual Wife, who ha&s;t been given him for &s;uch by</HI> N. <HI>his Proxy here pre&s;ent, upon Condition of the Dowry prefix'd and agreed on by both Parties.</HI></P></Q>
<P>After this the Mini&s;ter, or whoever he be that is pre&s;ent to make the Contract, ri&s;es, and laying his Head to the Tape&s;try which divides the Room, cries out to the Affianc'd,</P>
<P><Q><HI>Do you Ratifie the Promi&s;e which</HI> N. <HI>your Proxy has made in your behalf?</HI></Q> Who an&s;wers, <Q><HI>Yes.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Then he puts the &s;ame Que&s;tion to the other Proxy, makes the Contract, fixes the Seal, and cau&s;es the re&s;t that are met to Seal it likewi&s;e; and gives the Contract to the Proxy of the Affianc'd Virgin. Which Contract is kept by the Woman for the Security of her Dowry.</P>
<P>There is no difference between this, and the Ceremony of Marriages for time, when they hire VVives, only that the Proxies make their Promi&s;es on other Terms. As thus:</P>
<P><Q><HI>I</HI> N. <HI>by Virtue of an Authentick Procuration receiv'd from</HI> N. <HI>give her to</HI> N. <HI>to the end he may have the u&s;e of her for &s;uch a Term, and at &s;uch a Price.</HI></Q> Or thus:</P>
<P><Q><HI>I</HI> N. <HI>by Virtue of an Authentick Procuration from</HI> N. <HI>take in his Name</HI> N. <HI>to Wife. I take her upon the Conditions agreed upon, I take her upon my Soul.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The poor People make le&s;s &s;tir, without any Proxy: For the VVoman enters Veil'd with her Parents, who are al&s;o in the Room where the Men are, and then &s;ays the Party him|&s;elf,</P>
<Q><P><HI>I</HI> N. <HI>Proxy for my &s;elf, take you</HI> N. <HI>for my perpetual Wife, at &s;uch a certain Dowry; I take ye for &s;uch upon my Soul.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Now the VVomen are the Match makers; and as &s;oon as the Articles are agreed upon, the Husband &s;ettles the Dow|ry upon the cleare&s;t part of his E&s;tate, and then &s;ends the VVedding-Ring and the Pre&s;ents to his Bride: VVhich con|&s;i&s;t in Cloaths, Jewels, and Ready Money. For which the Bride returns him &s;everal Knick-Knacks, as Embroider'd Hand|kerchers, Toylets, Needlework Night-Caps, and &s;uch kind of Trifles, u&s;ually all made with her own Hands.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="154">
The Wedding is kept at the Mans Hou&s;e, and la&s;ts Ten Days: upon the Tenth Day, by broad Daylight, they &s;end him home that which is call'd the <HI>Bride's Bundle,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ts in Furniture, Jewels, Moveables, Slaves and Eunuchs, accor|ding to the Quality of the Bride, and all this upon Camels or other Bea&s;ts of Carriage, the Mu&s;ick playing before 'em. The Slaves and Eunuchs ride either upon the Packs or el&s;e on Hor&s;e-back: and &s;ometimes it happens that they borrow Hou&s;hold-Stuff and a Train, and &s;end empty Che&s;ts; and all to make a &s;hew and dazle the World. At Night the Bride is conducted home; and if &s;he be a Per&s;on of Quality &s;he is carry'd in a <HI>Cagiavat,</HI> being a kind of Cradle of which a Camel will carry two. If &s;he be a Per&s;on of mean Condition, &s;he is &s;et upon a Hor&s;e, or el&s;e goes a Foot: and then the Mu&s;ick marches fir&s;t; then the Servants with every one a Wax-Taper in their Hands; follow'd by the Women with lighted Candles in their Hands after the &s;ame manner. The Bride her &s;elf is veil'd from Head to Foot; with another Veil over that, plaited like a Ca&s;&s;ock; made of Silk and Silver, or Cloth of Gold, or plain Silk, which reaches down to her wa&s;te. So that a very Lynx could never be able to di&s;cover her &s;hape or Stature. If &s;he be afoot, two Women lead her by each Arm; if on Hor&s;eback, an Eunuch leads the Hor&s;e by the Bridle. About an Hour after &s;he has been at her Husbands Hou&s;e, the Nuptial Fea&s;t being over, the Matrons carry her into the Bridal Chamber, uncloath her to a little Wa&s;te-Coat, and a thin pair of Drawers next to it, and put her to Bed. Soon after the Bridegroom is conducted to the &s;ame place either by Eunuchs or Old Women, the Lights being all taken away when he enters the Room.</P>
<P>Thus the Man never &s;ees his Wife till after he has Con&s;um|mated the Marriage; and many times he never does that, till &s;everal Days after his Wife has been at home, the nice Lady flying his Embraces and hiding her &s;elf among the Women, or el&s;e unwilling to let her Husband meddle with her. Which Coyne&s;s frequently happens among Per&s;ons of Quality, who look upon it as a piece of Immode&s;ty to be&s;tow their la&s;t Fa|vours &s;o &s;oon. The Virgins of the Blood Royal more parti|cularly put their Husbands to this trouble, &s;o that it requires whole Months to reclaim 'em, and to per&s;wade 'em that their Husbands are worthy their Embraces.</P>
<P>To this purpo&s;e they tell a Story of a Daughter of <HI>Abas the Great,</HI> who was Marry'd to one of his Great Generals, that &s;he was a long time before &s;he would conde&s;cend &s;o much as to
<PB N="264" REF="155">
look upon her Husband. Thereupon the Lord complain'd to the King, <HI>That his Maje&s;ty had given him a Tygre&s;s in&s;tead of a Wife; that he dur&s;t not come near her; for that &s;he had Twice run at him with a Dagger in her Hand.</HI> At which <HI>Abas</HI> could not forbear Laughing, and ask'd him how many white Slaves he had in his Seraglio? The General an&s;wer'd, about Five and Forty. Then &s;aid the King, <HI>Lie with 'em all one after another, I am &s;ure that will be a means to reclaim your Wife.</HI> The Ge|neral took the Kings advice. The Prince&s;s enrag'd at this his manner of proceeding, ask'd him, if that were his Conjugal Faith that he had plighted to her, and &s;eeing he continu'd his Cour&s;e, notwith&s;tanding all her fury, made her complaints to the King, telling him, <HI>That &s;he came to demand Ju&s;tice of him again&s;t her Husband, who Ravi&s;h'd all his Maids and Slaves.</HI> To whom the King with an incens'd Countenance an&s;wer'd, <HI>That he had done it by his Order:</HI> and at the &s;ame time &s;ent her away, with an expre&s;s Command to invite her Husband to come and lie with her. Which the Prince&s;s did accordingly, and was well &s;atisfi'd.</P>
<P>To the &s;ame purpo&s;e they relate another very plea&s;ant Story of one of the Concubines of <HI>Sephi,</HI> the la&s;t King of that Name. She was a lovely Per&s;on, and for that rea&s;on infinitely belov'd of the Prince, which had made her extreamly Proud, and to take upon her many times to talk over boldly to the King. One Day therefore <HI>Sephi,</HI> who was naturally Cruel, was &s;o incens'd again&s;t her that he would have put her to Death; but his Anger not believing Death to be a &s;ufficient Puni&s;hment, he took from her all her Women, and her Eunuchs, caus'd all her Cloaths to be Burnt, and her Jewels to be Pounded in a Mortar, and the bitts of Stones to be flung into a Pond before her Face; and to add to her Ignominy, caus'd her to be Mar|ry'd to a Paltry <HI>Negro,</HI> that was one of his Cooks: and &s;o the Unfortunate Lady was &s;ent home to the Cooks Hou&s;e with only one Chamber-Maid left her. But when her frightful Husband thought to have approach'd her, the Chamber-Maid as Lovely and Maje&s;tick as her Mi&s;tre&s;s, drawing a naked Dagger out of her Pocket, and throwing her &s;elf before her Mi&s;tre&s;s, <HI>Dog of a</HI> Negro, &s;aid &s;he, <HI>Do but touch her &s;o much as with thy Finger, and I will make a Thou&s;and Holes i' thy Heart.</HI> Upon which the poor Cook flew for his Life; and the Story being told to the King, he was &s;o pleas'd with the action, that he recollected him&s;elf, a&s;&s;wag'd his Pa&s;&s;ion, Marry'd her to a Colonel, and &s;ent her Cloaths and Furniture &s;uitable to her Condition.</P>

There happens in the Marriages of the meaner &s;ort of Peo|ple, &s;omething that &s;eems to be quite the Contrary. For if the Man have oblig'd him&s;elf to make his Wife a Dowry, that exceeds his E&s;tate, to obtain the con&s;ent of his Wife's Parents; he &s;huts his Hou&s;e door when they bring her home, and cries that he will not give &s;o great a Price for her. Then the Pa|rents of both Parties di&s;pute the Matter between them&s;elves; and the Friends of the Bride are oblig'd to abate &s;omething, for fear the Bridegroom &s;hould refu&s;e her; for it would be the greate&s;t Di&s;honour in the World, as well for them, as for the Maid, to be carried back again.</P>
<P>Now one would think this way of Marrying, without e|ver &s;eeing the Parties face, &s;hould produce very unfortunate Matches; but it does not. Nay we may &s;ay in General, that the Matches are more happy in a Country, where the Men and Women never &s;ee one another, then where the Women are &s;o frequently &s;een and courted. And the Rea&s;on is plain: For they that &s;ee not another Mans wife, lo&s;e le&s;s &s;ud|denly the Affection which they have, or ought to have, for their own. And yet we cannot &s;ay the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> marry with|out altogether knowing whom neither. For the Mother or Kindred or other Per&s;ons, upon whom they rely for the choice of a Wife, make &s;uch a frequent and lively De&s;cription of the Virgin, that they may &s;ufficiently judge by their Re|port, whether the Original will plea&s;e, or whether &s;he be a fit Match or no. Be&s;ides when they are Girls, tho the Greate&s;t Lords Daughters, they are not &s;o clo&s;e lockt up, till they come to be above Seven or Eight Years of Age. Till which time they appear up and down the Hou&s;e, to the end they may be publickly &s;een and taken notice of; &s;o that &s;ometimes it happens, that a Man may have &s;een the Maid, pro|pos'd him for a Wife, e&s;pecially when &s;he was little.</P>
<P>The Mahometan Religion holds Divorce to be Lawful, however it be done, or whatever the Occa&s;ion may be. 'Tis &s;ufficient that one of the Parties di&s;likes the other, and that they re&s;olve to unmarry them&s;elves; for then, tho otherwi&s;e the mo&s;t prudent and civil People in the World, they pre&s;ent|ly divorce. Which Act of Separation is pa&s;s'd, either before a Judge or before a Church-man. This <HI>Act</HI> is called <HI>Talaac,</HI> or a <HI>Bill of Divorce;</HI> which being granted, the Parties are at Liberty to marry again where they plea&s;e them&s;elves. Upon the di&s;&s;olution of the Marriage, the Man is oblig'd to return the Woman her Dowry; if it be he that &s;ues out the Divorce;
<PB N="332" REF="156">
but if it be the Woman that &s;eeks the Separation, then &s;he lo&s;es her Portion. The Mahometans al&s;o hold for law|ful, the Renewing of Marriages di&s;&s;olv'd, and that they may di&s;&s;olve and renew and di&s;&s;olve Three times; but if it hap|pen that after a Divorce the third time, the Man and the Wo|man de&s;ire to come together a fourth time, they cannot do it; but upon this &s;trange Condition, that before the Woman marry another Husband, &s;he &s;hall dwell with him forty days, and then be divorc'd from him.</P>
<P>The <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> to &s;peak in general, rarely make u&s;e of this exce&s;&s;ive Licen&s;e to unmarry one another. The Citizens and Tradesmen &s;ometimes make their Advantages of it: But Per&s;ons of Quality will rather choo&s;e to dye, then repudiate their Wives, and you may as &s;oon take away their Lives, as force 'em to con&s;ent to a Divorce. The poorer &s;ort never u&s;e it, for they are too &s;illy and clott-pated to unmarry one another; be&s;ides that it would co&s;t 'em too dear, in regard they mu&s;t re|turn the Portion they had, upon the Repudiation. Which however occa&s;ions a more crying piece of Inju&s;tice to be com|mitted among the viler &s;ort. For they, when they would be rid of their Wives without returning their Portions, mi&s;u&s;e the woman in that terrible and inhumane manner, that &s;he is forc'd to &s;ue for a Divorce, and &s;acrifice all to her Liberty. Be&s;ides, the Courts of Judicature, rarely know the Differences that hap|pen between Man and Wife, the mi&s;cheivous Tricks that they play one another, and the Rea&s;ons that move 'em to &s;eparate. The Place where the Women are &s;hut up is &s;acred; e&s;peci|ally among Per&s;ons of Condition: And it is a Crime for any Per&s;on whatever, to be enquiring what pa&s;&s;es within tho&s;e Walls. The Husband has there an ab&s;olute Authority, with|out being oblig'd to give any accompt of his Actions. And 'tis &s;aid, that there are mo&s;t bloody doings in tho&s;e places &s;ometimes, and that Poy&s;on di&s;patches a World of People, which are thought to dye a natural Death.</P>
<P>The 12. I di&s;mi&s;s'd the Officer of the <HI>Can</HI> of <HI>Georgia,</HI> who conducted me to <HI>Irrivan.</HI> I made him a pre&s;ent of a|bout Six Guines; and gave him a Letter for <HI>Father Raphael</HI> of <HI>Parma,</HI> wherein I let him know how diligently the Offi|cers had &s;erv'd me, and de&s;ir'd him to give the Prince an Account of it, and to return him my humble Thanks. For it is the cu&s;tome to give &s;uch Letters of Commendation to tho&s;e &s;ort of Officers. Without which &s;hould they return to their Ma&s;ters, it would be a fault, for which they would not fail to be puni&s;h'd.</P>

The 13. I &s;tay'd at the Palace &s;ome part of the day, and din'd with the Governor. The 14 and 15. I din'd there likewi&s;e. He was extreamly civil to me, to the end I &s;hould let him have what he had a mind to at a cheap Rate. For 'tis not to be imagin'd, how the&s;e Per&s;ian Lords will deba&s;e them&s;elves, when they are dealing for their own Intere&s;t with People over whom they have no Authority. They are not a&s;ham'd to beg for what they have a de&s;ire to. They flatter, they prai&s;e, they promi&s;e, there is nothing &s;o mean, which they will not make u&s;e of to attain their Ends; and when they have once attain'd 'em, they have done with tho&s;e People. Which Inequality of Temper, they that have bu&s;ine&s;s in <HI>Per|&s;ia</HI> &s;hall have every day occa&s;ion to make Tryal of.</P>
<P>The 16. I went to vi&s;it the Patriarch of <HI>Armenia,</HI> who&s;e name was <HI>James,</HI> an Ancient Man, all over hairy, and venera|ble for his Pre&s;ence and A&s;pect, but of a fickle and incon&s;tant Di&s;po&s;ition, and who&s;e Behaviour ju&s;tify'd the Accu&s;ations which his Nation laid upon him, which were, that he wanted Judgment, but was very Ambitious. He lodg'd at the Epi&s;co|pal Man&s;ion; and was confin'd within the Walls of the Ci|ty. A misfortune that for &s;ome Pranks which he had play'd he had drawn upon him&s;elf. And as for that he then lay under, the occa&s;ion was this, of which he made me a long Rehear&s;al him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The <HI>Armenian</HI> Clergy is very much addicted to Symony, as well as that of the Ea&s;tern Sects. But that which they &s;ell mo&s;t dear is the holy Oyl, which they call <HI>Myrone.</HI> The mo&s;t part of the Ea&s;tern Chri&s;tians believe it to be a Bal&s;om, and a Remedy that phy&s;ically Cures all the Di&s;tempers of the Soul. Nay there are whole Societies of Chri&s;tians who be|lieve, that the Grace of Regeneration, and Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins, is imparted by the u&s;e of this Oyl: Saying, that in Bapti&s;m for Example, 'tis the Oyl and not the Water, which is the Matter pre&s;crib'd. And the Clergy keep the People in this pernicious Error, becau&s;e of the Advantages which they get by it, &s;elling at a dear rate the Unction of this Oyl. Which the Patriarch has the only right to Con&s;ecrate, and he &s;ells it to the Bi&s;hops and Prie&s;ts. Now about twelve Years &s;ince the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Patriarch began to project, how he might prevent the <HI>Armenian</HI> Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks over all the Ea&s;t from furni&s;hing them&s;elves with this Holy Oyl, from any other Per&s;on but him&s;elf. Tho&s;e of <HI>Turky</HI> bought it of the <HI>Armeni|an</HI> Patriarch re&s;iding at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and who is the Chief
<PB N="334" REF="157">
over all the <HI>Armenian</HI> Chri&s;tians within the Empire. <HI>James</HI> pretended, that it was not lawful for the <HI>Armenians</HI> of <HI>Turky,</HI> to go for Holy Oyl to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> but at a time when the War between the <HI>Turk</HI> and the <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> hinder'd 'em from coming to his See; and he was of opinion for a &s;um of Money, well expended at the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Court, he might obtain an Order from the <HI>Port,</HI> by vertue of which the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical <HI>Armenians</HI> of that Empire &s;hould be oblig'd to fetch their Holy Oyl from <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> as formerly. But fir&s;t he mu&s;t have the con&s;ent of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> King to undertake an Affair of that Importance, which <HI>James</HI> ea&s;ily obtain'd, and afterwards went to the <HI>Port;</HI> where after he had &s;pent a great deal of Money and Time, at length he obtain'd his Hearts de&s;ire.</P>
<P>All this while the <HI>Armenian</HI> Patriarch of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> a more Politic Prelate, and one better skill'd in the Affairs of <HI>Turky,</HI> never &s;tirr'd from his Seat, while the other was negotiating at the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s Court. He let him expend and exhau&s;t him&s;elf, and onely watch't for <HI>James</HI>'s Return into <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> But then it was no hard matter for him, to demon&s;trate to the <HI>Divan</HI> the <HI>Grand Signiors</HI> Intere&s;t in that Affair, and the Damage which his Highne&s;s did him&s;elf, in obliging the <HI>Arme|nians</HI> under his Subjection to fetch their Holy Oyl from <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> becau&s;e of the great Revenue which it produc'd. Where|upon the <HI>Divan</HI> cancell'd the Order which they had given the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Patriarch; and left the whole Bu&s;ine&s;s as it was be|fore.</P>
<P>However <HI>James</HI> to his own and the misfortune of his Nation, went on ob&s;tinately again&s;t his own Intere&s;t, he got a Re-hearing, believing that his large Pre&s;ents and his Importu|nity would at length gain him his Cau&s;e. I cannot tell cer|tainly, how much the Money was that he &s;pent in this idle Concern; but they &s;ay it amounted to no le&s;s than three&s;core thou&s;and Guines.</P>
<P>All that I know is this, that he owes fourty thou&s;and pound which he took up at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and &s;pent upon this &s;ame in|comparable Project. He borrow'd fir&s;t of the <HI>Armenians,</HI> as long as his Credit would la&s;t, and when they would lend him no more, then he borrow'd of the <HI>Turks.</HI> At length he became an ab&s;olute Bankrupt, and at the &s;ame time he was forc'd to quit his de&s;ign and retire out of <HI>Turky,</HI> where there is nothing to be done by men that have no money in their Pockets. The Patriarch however thought he could oblige the <HI>Armeniaus</HI> of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> that go and come to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> to
<PB N="335" REF="157">
pay what he ow'd the <HI>Turks.</HI> Which as he importun'd 'em to do, &s;o he obtain'd in part. For they paid &s;everal con&s;ide|rable Sums, in hopes to free their Patriarch out of his Trou|bles; whom they thought not to be &s;o deeply engag'd as they found him to be. But finding &s;till that after they had paid one Debt, larger Sums di&s;cover'd them&s;elves, and call'd for Satisfaction, they refus'd to disbur&s;e any more Money, not|with&s;tanding all the fair and foul Means he could u&s;e. <HI>James</HI> therefore &s;ooth'd up his Turki&s;h Creditors, and told 'em that if they would &s;end along with him two Tru&s;tees to re|ceive their Money in <HI>Armenia,</HI> he would pay 'em there: and &s;o they let him go upon his Word. But when he came home, he found both the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> and the <HI>Armenians</HI> equally offended with him for his extravagant Expences, and the Fol|ly of his De&s;ign; So that not a man would part with any Money, nor would they &s;uffer him to touch the Patriarchal Trea&s;ure: In&s;omuch that the two <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Tru&s;tees for the Cu&s;tomer of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> that came to receive the payment of Six Thou&s;and Guineys, which he ow'd their Ma&s;ter, were forc'd to return, finding the Patriarch to be utterly in&s;ol|vent.</P>
<P>The Cu&s;tomer perceiving his Debt to be &s;o de&s;perate, ob|tain'd an Order from the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> to the Governor of <HI>Er|zerum,</HI> to give his People, that return'd into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> all the A&s;&s;i|&s;tance he could, to enable 'em to recover the Debt. To that end the Governor gave 'em Letters of Recommendation for the <HI>Can of Erivan.</HI> But tho&s;e Letters prov'd of little or no ef|fect; and becau&s;e the Length of Journeys is very tedious in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and for that the di&s;tance of one Place to another hap|pens to be a great delay of Bu&s;ine&s;s, the Turki&s;h Tru&s;tees &s;tay'd a year at <HI>Erivan</HI> without doing any good. At length they receiv'd new Letters of Recommendation from the <HI>Grand Vizir,</HI> the Kaimacan of <HI>Constantinople</HI> and the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of <HI>Erzerum</HI> for the Governor of <HI>Erivan,</HI> which were &s;o full and &s;o importunate, that the Governor was forc'd to be&s;tir him|&s;elf. He &s;ent for the Patriarch, and told him he mu&s;t pay the &s;ix thou&s;and Guinneys. The Patriarch, who was really in&s;olvent, demon&s;trated his Inability to the Governor as clear|ly as could be done i' th' world, and be&s;ought him very earne&s;tly to obtain leave of him from the Court, that he might rai&s;e the Summ upon the Churches of <HI>Media</HI> and <HI>Geor|gia;</HI> and to oblige the Governor to intercede for it, gave him &s;everal con&s;iderable Pre&s;ents. So that the Governor at length
<PB N="336" REF="158">
con&s;enting, he not only petition'd for Leave, buthad it granted; and when it came, <HI>James</HI> &s;ent about his Deputies to put it in Execution. But both the Clergy and Seculars of tho&s;e Provin|ces, who are really very Poor, and continually vex'd with Impo|&s;itions, Levies of Money, Taxes and Impo&s;ts, refus'd to pay the Patriarch. Be&s;ides, when the Governors of <HI>Media</HI> and <HI>Georgia</HI> were inform'd of what the Patriarch had done, they forbid the <HI>Christians</HI> under their &s;ubjection to part with a Farthing; &s;aying withal, that the if Governor of <HI>Armenia</HI> were &s;o liberal to the Patriarch, he might make his Levies upon the Churches that belong to his own Government. Thereupon there was a nece&s;&s;ity for him, to write back to the Court. But the Governor of <HI>Armenia,</HI> fearing lea&s;t the Patriarch &s;hould ab&s;ent him&s;elf, or that he would not go to the Court, order'd him to keep at <HI>Erivan,</HI> and not to &s;tir thence without leave. And this was that Prelate's Condition, when I went to vi&s;it him. At what time he &s;eem'd to be very impatient in Expectation of the Re&s;olutions of the Court.</P>
<P>The 21. Forty &s;even Minutes after Sun-ri&s;e and the fir&s;t day of the Month <HI>Zilbage,</HI> which is the Twelfth Month of the Year among the <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> the Great Guns of the Fortre&s;s were thrice Di&s;charg'd, and the Garri&s;on gave three Vollies to give Notice that it was New-Years Day. And this they always do at the very Moment that the Sun enters in <HI>Aries,</HI> whether it be Day or Night. The A&s;trologers, who make their Ob&s;ervations very exactly with their <HI>Astrolobes,</HI> give the Signal, and then it is that all the Guns go off, as I have already &s;aid. This Fe&s;tival la&s;ts three days; and is the mo&s;t Solemn one that is celebrated in <HI>Per&s;ia:</HI> We &s;hall tell yee in a|nother place, after what manner it is Solemniz'd.</P>
<P>The 21. in the Afternoon I went to the Governor to wi&s;h him a <HI>happy New-Year;</HI> and pre&s;ented him at the &s;ame time with a Hafted Dagger, and a Sheath of Ivory inlay'd with Gold. Which the Governor very much admir'd, and was very well pleas'd. For it is the Cu&s;tom in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> now become a Law, never to come into the Pre&s;ence of a Great Per&s;on empty|handed during this Fe&s;tival. The Governor on the other &s;ide made me &s;it down by him, and gave me a Collation of dry'd and green Fruits, and Excellent Wines of <HI>Georgie</HI> and <HI>Shiras.</HI> The General of the Mint, and the King's <HI>Envoy,</HI> of whom we have already &s;poken, were both with him at the &s;ame time. So that I &s;taid two hours di&s;cour&s;ing of Sundry things.</P>
<P>The 25. he &s;ent for me, and after &s;everal Di&s;cour&s;es at
<PB N="337" REF="158">
Rovers, he told me, He was very much troubl'd for me, that I was come in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> at &s;uch an unlucky Sea&s;on, when there was &s;o little Trade for Jewels, for that the King had little or no e&s;teem for 'em, and therefore bought very few. That I was not now to look upon my Condition, as if King <HI>Abas</HI> were alive, for tho&s;e days were gone; and that I &s;hould find it a hard matter at Court to put off the worth of Three Thou&s;and Pound. Then going on, he told me farther, That he did not &s;peak this to di&s;courage me, but that I might betimes con&s;ider what I had to do, and lo&s;e no opportunity of &s;elling what I had brought: That he had a de&s;ign to lay out to the value of Two Thou&s;and Five Hundred Pounds, if I would let him have good Bargains. Pre&s;ently I found what the Governor aim'd at by his Di&s;cour&s;e, and that his Advice tho very good and true, proceeded rather from Intere&s;t, then that he was really con|cern'd for my Benefit. However I return'd him Thanks, and told him, I heard of the Great Change of Humor at Court, but yet for all that I did not que&s;tion but to &s;ell, expecting from his Maje&s;ty's Ju&s;tice that he would con&s;ider, that I had not made &s;uch a tedious Voyage, nor brought &s;o many Jew|els, but by the Orders of the Decea&s;ed King his Father. Ne|verthele&s;s, that I was re&s;olv'd to &s;ell as much as I could without Lo&s;s, and that I was &s;o much beholding to him for his Favors and his particular Care of me, that I would &s;ell Cheaper to him then to another Per&s;on.</P>
<P>Thereupon the Governor promis'd me, that I &s;hould have the favour of his Sons, and be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by all the Credit which they had at Court; to which purpo&s;e he would give me mo&s;t Effectual and Earne&s;t Recommendations, and at length or|der'd me to bring all that he had &s;et apart. He told me he would make his fir&s;t Purcha&s;es of little Jewels and of &s;mall value, to the end he might &s;ee, whether I would be as good as my word. Which Method of his did no way plea&s;e me, and therefore I propounded to him to take all at a Lump, and ne|ver to make two Bargains, a&s;&s;uring him that he would find it his cheape&s;t way. After that I de&s;ir'd him to begin with the Great Pieces; but he refus'd to accept either of my Propo|&s;als; he knew how to manage me &s;o dextrou&s;ly, that he per|&s;waded me that his Intentions were real, and that he would try by tho&s;e things wherein he had mo&s;t Judgment, whether I &s;old him dear or no. So then we agreed upon a Price for Forty Watches of &s;everal Fa&s;hions: All which I &s;old him at a low rate, to purcha&s;e his good Opinion, and to the end I might
<PB N="338" REF="159">
&s;ell him more of my Commodities. Pre&s;ently he &s;ent me to his Ca&s;hier to receive my Money; which while we were telling, in he came with a great Chry&s;tal Looking gla&s;s &s;et in Gold, which he had &s;et a&s;ide from among tho&s;e other that I had &s;hewn him, and telling me, <HI>the hour was now lucky,</HI> ask'd me the Price of the Gla&s;s; and I let him have it for Five Hundred Crowns, which he paid me with the re&s;t of my Mo|ney. For the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> are &s;trangly infatuated with Judicial A&s;trology, and attribute to the Influences of the Stars all their good and bad Succe&s;s. And when two Stars which they call <HI>Benign,</HI> are in Conjunction, that they call the <HI>lucky hour.</HI></P>
<P>The 27. The Governor did me the Honour to give me a vi&s;it. Tho I had rather he had let his vi&s;it alone; for it co&s;t me a Gold-Box of Eight Guineys. Which I pre&s;ented to him to gratifie the Cu&s;tom of the Country; which is, to re|pay the vi&s;its of great Per&s;onages with a Pre&s;ent. The Go|vernor &s;taid a quarter of an hour in my Chamber; after which he went and made a &s;top where the People that be|long'd to the <HI>Cu&s;tomer</HI> of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> lay, which was very near to my Apartment. Then he went and vi&s;ited a <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Merchant, and an <HI>Armenian</HI> Merchant, that lodg'd in the &s;ame Inn, who made him every one a Pre&s;ent, but of things of little value. The People that belong'd to the Cu&s;tomer of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> gave him two Ducats, the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Merchant a little bag of Coffee, worth an Angel, and the <HI>Armenian</HI> pre|&s;ented him with two Ells of Damask. For the Governor comes forth out of the Ca&s;tle into the City con&s;tantly twice a Week, that is, <HI>Frydays</HI> and <HI>Saturdays; Fryday</HI> he goes publickly to the <HI>Mo&s;que&eacute;</HI> to &s;ay his Prayers; <HI>Saturday</HI> he vi&s;its every Quarter of the City, and gives &s;uch Orders as he finds to be requi&s;ite. So that there can be nothing better contriv'd then his Method of Government. If he &s;top before any Hou&s;e they never make him any Pre&s;ent, unle&s;s they plea&s;e them&s;elves. But if he go into the Hou&s;e, Cu&s;tom obliges 'em to pre&s;ent him. And there is an Officer, call'd <HI>the Re|ceiver of Pre&s;ents,</HI> who keeps an account of all that is pre&s;ent|ed him, let it be of never &s;o mean a value.</P>
<P>The 29. and 30. I din'd with the Governor, and &s;old him as many ordinary Jewels as came to about Five Hundred Pounds. We drove our Bargains every price by it &s;elf, and when we were come to a Price he paid me in ready Money. And mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly he got by that way of dealing;
<PB N="339" REF="159">
for by that means I &s;old him at a much cheaper rate. The &s;ame day a little after I was return'd to my Lodging, the Prince&s;s his Wife &s;ent for me, to make her a price of &s;ome cer|tain Jewels which &s;he had made choice of. But ju&s;t as I was ready to take Hor&s;e, the General of the Mint, and the Kings Slave came to give me a vi&s;it, &s;o that I could not go to the Ca&s;tle that day: neither would I go the three next days, as being the three la&s;t of the Pa&s;&s;ion Week; but the Fourth of <HI>April</HI> I went. So &s;oon as I came, the Prince&s;&s;e's Steward, who was an old <HI>Eunuch,</HI> told me, That the Prince&s;s was extreamly angry that I had &s;tay'd &s;o long, and that if one of the Coun|try &s;hould have &s;erv'd her &s;o, &s;he would have made him feel two hundred Drubs upon the Soles of his Feet. At which I laught, and ask'd the <HI>Eunuch,</HI> if his Lady were wont to pronounce Sentences. Sir, &s;aid he, &s;he is one of the Haugh|tie&s;t Ladies in the World; and for the lea&s;t fault exacts a mo&s;t &s;evere puni&s;hment. If it be a man that has offended her, &s;he &s;ends her <HI>Eunuchs</HI> to &s;eize him, who bind him hand and foot, and put him in a Sack, carry him into the <HI>Seraglio</HI> into her pre&s;ence, and puni&s;h him according to her Com|mands, without letting him out of the Sack, or &s;uffering him to know where he is. But I never yet knew that the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Ladies ever inflicted &s;uch &s;ort of puni&s;hments. And there|fore I de&s;ir'd the <HI>Eunuch,</HI> to let the Prince&s;s know the Rea&s;on that had kept me at home, and that I was always ready to obey her Commands. I tarry'd above four hours at the en|trance into the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> while the <HI>Eunuch</HI> went and came back. At length a Bargain was made between us for &s;o ma|ny Jewels as amounted to Four Hundred Pounds, for which I received my Money the next Morning.</P>
<P>The 3. I went to the Governor, and de&s;ir'd him to give me leave to depart; for that I was in ha&s;t to be at Court. He pro|mis'd to di&s;patch me after Dinner: and I waited on him again at his time appointed. At what time, he ask'd me with a &s;miling Countenance what was the value of the Gold Box I had given him, when he came to vi&s;it me. I knew not what his de&s;ign was, and therefore in my an&s;wer I valued it at Ten Pounds. Pray then Sir, &s;aid he, oblige me to take it again and give me the value of it in Keys, in Springs and Strings for Wat|ches. I was not a little &s;urpriz'd at his Propo&s;al, which did not &s;eem to be very civil for a Per&s;on of his Quality. However I an|&s;wer'd him, that I was ready to do what he pleas'd &amp; added that I had &s;everal Watchmakers Tools, that I had brought for the
<PB N="340" REF="160">
Kings Artificers, which I would &s;end him, if it were his Plea|&s;ure. He took me at my word, a&s;&s;uring me that I &s;hould do him a very great kindne&s;s. For this &s;ame Grandee is a great Lover of Mechanicks, and knows how to mend a Watch that does not go true. Afterwards he caus'd all that remain'd in his hands of mine to be delivered me back: and I thought certainly that he would have made an entire Bargain; but to my great A&s;toni&s;hment he re&s;tor'd me all. Then I per|ceiv'd I had been his Cully, and that he had only drill'd me on in hopes of &s;elling him a great Purcha&s;e, to let him have what he chiefly de&s;ir'd at a cheaper tate. However I con|ceal'd my di&s;gu&s;t, and my di&s;&s;atisfaction to be &s;o &s;erv'd; and return'd him a thou&s;and Thanks, with a Countenance as gay, as if I had had my hearts de&s;ire. Afterwards I be&s;ought him to give me his Letters of Recommendation to his Son: which he promis'd me to do, and invited me to go along with him into the Country, whither he went the next morning. But I excus'd my &s;elf, returning him Thanks in the be&s;t Lan|guage I could. I al&s;o reque&s;ted him to give me the Agree|ment with Mr. <HI>Azarias,</HI> who was to accompany me to <HI>Tau|ris.</HI> I will &s;o, an&s;wer'd his Lord&s;hip, and I will enjoyn him to be your <HI>Mehemandar,</HI> or Guide, meaning that hone&s;t <HI>Armenian</HI> already mention'd. This done, I again return'd him my humble Thanks for all his Favors; and after I had told him that I would not fail to extol his Kindne&s;&s;es at Court, I took my leave. I thought it not proper to put him in mind of &s;everal other Promi&s;es that he had made me; as being a&s;&s;ur'd they would produce little, for that according to the Cu&s;tom of the Country he had made 'em, not with an intention to be as good as his word, but onely to make me the more ready to do what he de&s;ir'd.</P>
<P>The 5. the Governor went to the Camp, which he had caus'd to be &s;et up about a League from the City, in a &s;paci|ous and lovely Meadow, all cover'd with flowers during the fair Sea&s;on. The two Rivers that encompa&s;s <HI>Erivan,</HI> and run along with a winding Cour&s;e and gentle Stream, make &s;everal little I&s;lands in that Place. So that the Governors Quarter, that of the Prince&s;s his Wife, and tho&s;e of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Per&s;ons that accompani'd him, were all &s;eparated; while every one had their particular I&s;land; which were joyn'd together by certain little Bridges, that were laid on or tak'n away, as occa&s;ion requir'd. The Governor's Tents were very Magnificent; and indeed there were in a little Ground
<PB N="341" REF="160">
all the Conveniencies of a Palace even to the very Bathes and Stoves. His Family con&s;i&s;ted of about Five Hundred Men, without reckoning the Women and <HI>Eunuchs.</HI> And it is the Cu&s;tom of the Grandees of this Kingdom to &s;olace them|&s;elves in this manner in the Country in the Spring Time. There they divertize them&s;elves in Hunting, Fi&s;hing, Walk|ing and employ them&s;elves in &s;everal other Exerci&s;es, both a Foot and on Hor&s;e-back: There they &s;uck in the fre&s;h Air, and enjoy that Coolne&s;s which they &s;o much delight in. This is the Refre&s;hment and Recreation of their Lives; &s;o that if they have no bu&s;ine&s;s in the City which requires their Pre&s;ence there, they continue thus taking their plea&s;ure all the Summer long, in the mo&s;t delicious parts of the Neigbouring Moun|taines. This they call <HI>Yelac:</HI> or a <HI>Country Excur&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>The 6. The Prince's Trea&s;urer gave me a Dinner, and the Kings Lieutenant of the Fortre&s;s was at it. He is a Native of <HI>Dag-E&s;taan.</HI> Which is a Mountainous Country to the North-Ea&s;t of the Ca&s;pian Sea, and bordering upon <HI>Mu&s;covie.</HI> So that I took great delight to hear him repeat &s;everal parti|culars of the Cu&s;tomes and Manners of his Country. The King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> is acknowledg'd there as Soveraign Lord; but he is not ab&s;olute Ma&s;ter of it: nor are the People that inha|bit it always &s;ubject to his Commands. And the Court winks at their Di&s;obediences; it being a difficult thing to re|duce 'em, by rea&s;on of the Roughne&s;s and Height of the Mountaines. They are a Savage &s;ort of People, and the mo&s;t barbarous of all the Ea&s;t: and I take 'em to be &s;ome Remainders of the <HI>Parthians.</HI> The &s;ame Evening that Gen|tleman &s;ent me a Pre&s;ent of Fruit, Wine, and Mutton.</P>
<P>The 7. The Trea&s;urer &s;ent me much &s;uch another Pre&s;ent, as the Governor had &s;ent me the day before: and I repay'd 'em in &s;mall Returnes for the Favors I had receiv'd from Both. They had been very civil to me at <HI>Erivan,</HI> not &s;o much as offering to take tho&s;e fees, which men are oblig'd to pay in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> to the Officers of Governors, for all the Money receiv'd out of their Trea&s;uries; for that their Ma&s;ter had forbid 'em to de|mand any thing of me. And therefore they did me tho&s;e Kindne&s;&s;es to oblige me to be the more free of my own ac|cord; well knowing I was not &s;o ignorant of the Cu&s;tomes of the Country, but that I knew that it was not any motion of Genero&s;ity, that made 'em &s;o courteous to Strangers.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon I went to the Camp, to take leave of the Governor; who &s;hew'd me a thou&s;and Civilities; and at my
<PB N="342" REF="161">
departure gave me two Letters of Recommendation to his two Elde&s;t Sons, who are the Kings onely Favourites. They were both much to the &s;ame Effect. And this is the Tran&s;la|tion of that which was written to the Elde&s;t.</P>

<P>(a) The <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> word which I have tran&s;lated, <HI>the Refuge of the World,</HI> is <HI>Alempenha. Alem</HI> &s;ignifies <HI>the whole entire World,</HI> or <HI>Univer&s;al Nature.

Upon the out&s;ide of the Letter, at one Corner was written in a &s;mall Character. <HI>God pre&s;erve the happy Condition of my Friend.</HI></P>
<P>While I &s;tay'd at the Camp, there arriv'd a Courier from the King, who brought his Maje&s;ties An&s;wer touching the Patriarch's Bu&s;ine&s;s. And I under&s;tood at the Governours, that the Contents were, That the Chief Mini&s;ters were of Opi|nion, that the Trea&s;ure at <HI>Ec&s;miazin</HI> &s;hould be &s;old with all the Ornaments, and all the Wealth belonging to the Church and Convent: and that the Money that was made of it &s;hould go to the payment of the Patriarch's Debts. And that this Re&s;olution had been taken, except Oppo&s;ition had been made by the <HI>Armenians,</HI> by repre&s;enting that all that Mo|ney would nothing near &s;atisfie the Patriarch's Concerns; and that if they took away from <HI>Ec&s;miazin</HI> its Trea&s;ure and its Or|naments, they would ruine a place that drew a world of Com|pany into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and which yearly paid a very great Rent, occa&s;ion'd by the Devotion and Concour&s;e of the Ea&s;tern Chri&s;tians: That upon that the King had decreed, That the Money &s;hould be levy'd in <HI>Armenia</HI> upon all the Chri&s;tian Vil|lages to &s;atisfie the Cu&s;tomer of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> whom there was a nece&s;&s;ity to &s;ee paid. The Patriarch was over-joy'd at the News, and made a Pre&s;ent to him that brought it; but it di&s;pleas'd all the hone&s;t People in the City, who were vex'd to the Souls, to &s;ee the Prelate &s;o in&s;en&s;ible of the Violence they were going to offer to thou&s;ands of Poor Chri&s;tians, to pay for the Expences of his irregular Ambition.</P>
<P>The 8. an hour before day, I parted from <HI>Erivan,</HI> and tra|vell'd four Leagues over the little Hills, and through Valleys, the Country which I cro&s;s'd being full of Villages. In one of which that was a very fair and large one I lodg'd, call'd by the name of <HI>Daivin.</HI></P>
<P>The 9. we travell'd five Leagues through a Country that was very level and fertile. That which they call the Moun|tain of <HI>Noah,</HI> lying upon the Right Hand. We directed our Cour&s;e South-We&s;t, and lay at a Village call'd <HI>Kainer.</HI></P>
<P>The 10. we continu'd the &s;ame Road, and travell'd eight Leagues. Upon the left hand, after we got half the way, we left a great Town call'd <HI>Sederec.</HI> Which is as it were the Ca|pital of the Province of <HI>Armenia,</HI> call'd <HI>Charour.</HI> The Sultan of which Province re&s;ides in that Town. That Night we had but a very bad Lodging in an old ruin'd Inn, near to a Village call'd <HI>Nouratchin.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="162">
The 11. We travell'd four Leagues upon the &s;ame Road, and through a very fair Country; but not &s;o level, nor &s;mooth, as being &s;tony, and full of little Hills. We al&s;o ferry'd over a River call'd <HI>Harpa&s;ony,</HI> that waters all the Neighbouring Lands. It &s;eparates the Government of that part of <HI>Armenia,</HI> of which <HI>Erivan</HI> is the Capital, from that other part of which <HI>Nacchivan</HI> is the <HI>Metropolis.</HI></P>
<P>The 12. we arriv'd at <HI>Nacchivan,</HI> after we had travell'd five Leagues over Plaines very level and Fertile.</P>
<P><HI>Nacchivan</HI> is a great City, or rather a va&s;t heap of Ruins, which are repair'd and repeopl'd by degrees. The heart of the City is at pre&s;ent rebuilt and inhahited; having very large <HI>Bazars,</HI> which are a &s;ort of long Galleries, or Streets that are cover'd, full of Shops on both &s;ides; where they &s;ell all Sorts of Merchandizes and Provi&s;ions. There are in it five Inns or <HI>Caravan&s;erays,</HI> Baths, Market Places, large Publick Hou&s;es, where they &s;ell Tobacco and Coffee; and two Thou&s;and Hou&s;es or thereabouts. The <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Hi&s;tories a&s;&s;ure us, that formerly it contain'd above Forty Thou&s;and. They al&s;o tell us, that before the <HI>Arabians</HI> conquer'd this Country, there were in it five Cities which had been built by <HI>Behron-Tchoubin</HI> King of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> Without the City are to be &s;een the Ruins of a great Ca&s;tle, and &s;everal Forts which <HI>Abas</HI> caus'd to be de&s;troy'd, toward the end of the la&s;t Age, not finding him|&s;elf &s;trong enough to keep 'em: All which he caus'd to be ruin'd, after he had taken <HI>Nacchiavan</HI> from the Turks; and after he had ruin'd and di&s;peopl'd the City. Which he did to prevent the <HI>Turks</HI> from Fortifying them&s;elves in that Place, and furni&s;hing them&s;elves with Provi&s;ions. Mo&s;t certain|ly the City is an Object of Pity, con&s;idering in what a Condi|tion it now lies.</P>
<P>The Hi&s;tories of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> would have us believe, that it was one of the Greate&s;t and Faire&s;t Cities of all <HI>Armenia,</HI> as has been already &s;aid. But that Hi&s;tory, now kept in the Mona|&s;tery of the <HI>Three Churches,</HI> and which is chiefly &s;pok'n of, do|clares, that this City was the ancient <HI>Arda&s;hhad,</HI> call'd <HI>Artaxate,</HI> or <HI>Artaxa&s;ate</HI> by the <HI>Greek</HI> Hi&s;torians. Other <HI>Armenian</HI> Au|thors make <HI>Nacchivan</HI> to be much more Ancient, and a&s;&s;ert that <HI>Noah</HI> began to build it, and made it his Abode after the Deluge. And they make the Etymology of the Name to agree with the Antiquity of the Original: Affirming, that in the old <HI>Armenian</HI> Language <HI>Nacchivan</HI> &s;ignifies the <HI>fir&s;t Habi|tation. Ptolomy</HI> makes mention of a City in the&s;e Parts,
<PB N="346" REF="163">
which he calls <HI>Naxuane,</HI> which might have been the &s;ame with <HI>Nacchivan.</HI> I believe that <HI>Artaxate,</HI> or <HI>Artaxa&s;ate,</HI> was &s;eated very near it. For <HI>Tacitus</HI> ob&s;erves, that <HI>Araxes</HI> ran very near that City; and we find it not to be above &s;even Leagues from <HI>Nacchivan.</HI> The height of the Pole over it's Horizon is mark'd upon the <HI>Per&s;ian A&s;trolobes,</HI> to be 38. deg. 40. min. and the Longitude 81. deg. 34. min. It is go|vern'd by a <HI>Kan,</HI> and is the Capital of one part of <HI>Armenia.</HI></P>
<P>Five Leagues from <HI>Nacchivan,</HI> to the North, lies a great vil|lage, call'd <HI>Abrener;</HI> which &s;ignifies the <HI>Fertil Field.</HI> The in|habitants of that Village, and of &s;even others near it, are all <HI>Roman Catholicks.</HI> Their Bi&s;hops and Curates, are <HI>Domini|cans;</HI> and they perform their Church and Service, in the <HI>Ar|menian</HI> language.</P>
<P>He was an <HI>Italian Dominican</HI> of <HI>Bologna,</HI> that brought all this Country under Subjection to the <HI>Pope,</HI> about 350. years ago. And about twenty villages more that lay round ac|knowledg'd the &s;ame Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Jurisdiction. But at length they return'd to their obedience under the <HI>Armenian</HI> Pa|triarch, and to their fir&s;t Religion: and as for tho&s;e that per&s;i&s;t in the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Ceremonies, their Number daily decrea&s;es, by rea&s;on of the Per&s;ecution of the Patriarch, and the Gover|nors of <HI>Nacchivan.</HI> Tho&s;e poor people, having drawn up|on their own heads, the Indignation and violent U&s;age of tho&s;e Governors, for having endeavour'd to withdraw them&s;elves from their Juri&s;diction &amp; Dependence. To which purpo&s;e there arriv'd in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> in the year 1664. an <HI>Italian Dominican,</HI> in the Quality of an Emba&s;&s;ador, from the Pope. From whom, and from &s;everal other Potentates of <HI>Europe,</HI> he brought Letters to the King. He made great Pre&s;ents to his Maje&s;ty, and obtain'd effectually, That tho&s;e <HI>Roman Catholick</HI> Villages, &s;hould every year &s;end their Tribute to the Royal Trea&s;ure, and whatever they were oblig'd to pay yearly, according to the Rates &s;et down in Writing in the Regi&s;ters of the Superinten|dant and Receiver-General of <HI>Media.</HI> Which being done, that Orders &s;hould be &s;ent to the Super-intendant and Governor of <HI>Nacchivan,</HI> and all other, the Kings Officers, to acknowledge the <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> to be ab&s;olutely indepen|dant from their Juri&s;diction, and that they &s;hould not pre|&s;ume to make any Levies within their Territories. Which Regulation, that did very little good to tho&s;e villages, was the occa&s;ion of many Mi&s;chiefs that afterwards befell em; and will one day be the cau&s;e of their Ruin. For the Go|vernors
<PB N="347" REF="163">
of <HI>Nacchivan</HI> provok'd at the&s;e proceedings, and the complaints that were made of 'em to <HI>Abas,</HI> have lay'd a thou&s;and heavy Impo&s;itions, upon tho&s;e poor People, &s;ince the death of that good King; and have made 'em pay three or four times the money which they &s;ent to the Trea&s;ure Roy|al. For which the oppre&s;&s;ed people can have no remedy; whether through the Remi&s;&s;ne&s;s of the Government, or for that their own Party is low and out of Credit. The Trea&s;urer of <HI>Media</HI> has done wor&s;e, for he has &s;ent to Court fal&s;e extracts of the Regi&s;ters of that Province, by which it appears that tho&s;e villages were to pay fourteen hundred pounds yearly, which is ju&s;t as much again as what they pre|tend to have always paid. Every time they carry their Im|po&s;ition of Seven Hundred Pounds into the Trea&s;ury, the Officers give 'em a Receipt, wherein they put that it is upon Account of what they ought to pay, by which they keep a Door open for Arbitrary Impo&s;itions, and Branglings to ruin 'em when they plea&s;e them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The Governor of <HI>Nacchivan</HI> was not in Town when I arriv'd there. But this Son that was Deputy, had &s;oon notice of my arrival. So that he invited me to Dinner, and de&s;ir'd me to &s;hew him &s;ome Watches and &s;ome Jewels. But I was no way &s;atisfi'd with his manner of dealing with me. For after he had been civil to me, and had giv'n me a dinner, he left me with his officers who forc'd me in a manner, to let him have that for fourty pounds, for which I refus'd fifty at <HI>Erivan.</HI> And without que&s;tion they had us'd me more unci|villy, but for the King's Pattent and Pa&s;s port which I had a|bout me. And indeed tho&s;e Thorow-fairs are a &s;ort of Places for the skinning of &s;trangers, who are reputed to be rich. They mu&s;t alway there pay Pa&s;&s;age-money.</P>
<P>The 13. We departed from <HI>Nacchivan,</HI> and travell'd &s;even Leagues: At the end of the fir&s;t League pa&s;&s;ing a River over a very broad Bridge, to which the People of the Country give no other name then that of the River of <HI>Nacchivan.</HI> The Coun|try which we pa&s;s'd is dry and Stony, where was nothing to be &s;een but little Hills of Stones. We lay upon the Banks of the River <HI>Araxes,</HI> which the Orientals call <HI>Aras</HI> and <HI>Ares.</HI> We pa&s;s it at <HI>E&s;qui-julfa,</HI> or <HI>Julfa</HI> the old, a ruin'd City, which &s;ome Authors beleive to be that City which the Ancients call'd <HI>Ariammene.</HI> They call'd it <HI>Old</HI> to di&s;tingui&s;h it from <HI>Julfa,</HI> that is built over again&s;t <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI> Nor is it without rea&s;on &s;o call'd, as being totally ruin'd and demoli&s;hed. There is no|thing

farther to be known of it, except the Grandeur, which it once enjoy'd. It was &s;eated upon the de&s;cent of a Moun|tain, by the &s;ide of a River, that ran clo&s;e by it. The Ave|nues to it, which are naturally very difficult of Acce&s;s, were de|fended by &s;everal Forts. It contain'd four thou&s;and Hou&s;es, as the <HI>Armenians</HI> report; but if we judge by its Ruines, it ne|ver could contain half the number. At pre&s;ent there are no|thing but Holes and Caverns, made in the Mountains, fitter for Bea&s;ts then Men. I do not believe there is in the world a more barren or hideous Place, then that of <HI>Old Julfa,</HI> where there is neither Tree nor Gra&s;s to be &s;een. True it is, that in the Neighbourhood there are &s;ome Places more happy and fer|tile; yet on the other &s;ide it is as true, that never was any City &s;eated in a Situation more dry and &s;tony. But the Fi|gure of it &s;omewhat recompens'd the Situation, re&s;embling a long Amphitheater. At pre&s;ent there are not above thirty Families in it, which are all <HI>Armenians.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Abas</HI> the <HI>Great</HI> was the Prince that ruin'd <HI>Julfa,</HI> and all that Art had contributed to its Fortification. Which he did for the &s;ame rea&s;on that he ruin'd <HI>Nacchivan</HI> and other Places, of <HI>Armenia,</HI> to hinder the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Armies from Provi&s;ions. For he being a prudent and Politick Captain, finding his Forces inferior to tho&s;e of his Enemies; and &s;tudious how to prevent their return every year into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> their winning and pre|&s;erving their Conque&s;ts, re&s;olv'd to make a De&s;art of all the Country between <HI>Erzerum &amp;Tauris,</HI> upon the line of <HI>Erivan</HI> and <HI>Nacchivan;</HI> which was the road which the <HI>Turks</HI> u&s;ually ob&s;erv'd, and where they fortifi'd them&s;elves, becau&s;e they found provi&s;ions &s;ufficient for the &s;upport of their Armies. To that purpo&s;e therefore he tran&s;planted all the Inhabitants and Cattel, ruin'd all the Hou&s;es and Buildings; fird all the Country, burnt up all the Turf and the Trees, poy&s;on'd the very Springs, as the Hi&s;tory relates; and they who have read the Story well know, that it had an effect an&s;werable to his wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>But to return to our li&s;ts; <HI>Araxes</HI> is that famous River that &s;eparates <HI>Armenia</HI> from <HI>Media.</HI> It takes its Ri&s;e from the Mountain, where they affirm that <HI>Noah's</HI> Ark re&s;ted, and per|haps it may derive its name from that Mountain. From thence it empties its &s;elf into the <HI>Ca&s;pian Sea.</HI> This River is very Large and very Rapid. In it's Cour&s;e it is augmented by &s;everal le&s;&s;er &s;treams that have no name, as al&s;o by &s;everal Torrents. Bridges have been built over it &s;everal times above

<HI>Julfa;</HI> but though they made 'em never &s;o &s;trong and ma&s;&s;ie, as appears by the Arches which are yet intire, they were not able to with&s;tand the force of the River; It becomes &s;o furious when &s;well'd by the Thaws of the Snow that falls down melted from the neighbouring Mountains, that no Damms or other Fortifications can with&s;tand it. And in truth the very Noi&s;e of the Waters, and the Rapidne&s;s of it's Cour&s;e, a&s;toni&s;h both the Ears and Eyes of all that come near it. We ferri'd over it in a large Boat; made to carry twenty Hor&s;e and thirty Per&s;ons at a time. But I would not &s;uffer any to go along with me at the &s;ame time, but my own People and my own Baggage. It had four men to manage it. They row'd up about three hundred paces along the &s;hoar a this &s;ide, then let the Barque drive us back with the &s;tream; and &s;o by the help of a long and &s;trong Rudder guided the Boat to the other &s;ide. The current carry'd it with an un&s;peakable Impetuo&s;ity, &s;o that we ran five hundred Paces in an in&s;tant. And thus it is that the Ferrymen cro&s;s the River <HI>Araxes.</HI> They allow them|&s;elves two hours to go and come; by rea&s;on of the time they mu&s;t &s;pend in pulling up again&s;t the &s;tream. But in the Winter when the Waters are low, you may pa&s;s it upon the Camels Backs: the Ford being half a mile from <HI>Julfa,</HI> in a part where the Channel being very broad, the current is much more gentle.</P>
<P>We have &s;aid that <HI>Araxes</HI> &s;eparates <HI>Armenia</HI> from <HI>Media.</HI> This Country that formerly rul'd all <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> with Imperial Do|minion, at pre&s;ent makes but one part of a Province of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> which the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> call <HI>Azerbeyan,</HI> or <HI>A&s;upaican.</HI> However it is one of the large&s;t in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Empire.

A&s;&s;yria</HI> is a part of the upper <HI>Armenia.</HI> The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> a&s;&s;irm, that this Place was call'd <HI>Azer-beyan,</HI> that is, the <HI>Country of Fire;</HI> by rea&s;on of the famous Temple of Fire which was there erected, where was kept their Fire, which the <HI>Fire-wor&s;hippers,</HI> held to be a God; and becau&s;e the chief Pontiff of that Religion re&s;ided there.

about two days journey di&s;tant from <HI>Shamaki.</HI> They a&s;&s;ure us for a certain truth, that the &s;acred Fire is &s;till there; that it re&s;embles a Mineral and &s;ubterraneall Fire; and that they who repair thither out of Devotion &s;ee it in the form of a Flame. Nay they add one particular more, which is a &s;ort of plea&s;ant &s;tory, that if you make a hole in the ground, and &s;et a pot over it, that &s;ame fire will cau&s;e it to &s;eeth, and boyles all that is in the Pot.</P>
<P>To return to the Name of <HI>Azer-beyan,</HI> the <HI>Etymologie</HI> is true: for <HI>Az</HI> is the Article of the Genitive. <HI>Er</HI> or <HI>Ur,</HI> in old <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> as in mo&s;t part of the Ancient Oriental <HI>Idioms,</HI> &s;ignifies <HI>Fire,</HI> and <HI>Bey|an</HI> &s;ignifies a <HI>Place</HI> or <HI>Country.</HI> I am not ignorant that &s;ome people read and pronounce it <HI>A&s;ur-paican,</HI> and affirm that this geat Pro|vince was&s;o call'd, becau&s;e it contains <HI>A&s;&s;yria;</HI> which in the opi|nion of all Authors, deriv'd its Name from <HI>A&s;&s;ur;</HI> which is the &s;ame thing in my Opinion; for I am apt to think that the Name of <HI>A&s;&s;ur,</HI> comes from <HI>Az, Ur,</HI> that is <HI>of Fire. Mo&s;es</HI> &s;peaking of <HI>Nimrod,</HI> that Idolatrous Prince, who introduced the Wor&s;hip of <HI>Fire,</HI> and invaded <HI>Chaldea,</HI> the &s;hare and Patrimo|ny of <HI>Sem,</HI> tells us, that the Sons of that Patriarch retir'd thither, and that <HI>A&s;hur</HI> was one. Now 'tis very probable, that this <HI>A&s;hur</HI> was &s;o call'd from his retiring thither, or from the wor|&s;hip of <HI>Fire;</HI> or from <HI>Chaldea,</HI> which was then call'd the <HI>Coun|try of Fire;</HI> as appears C. 11. of <HI>Gene&s;is,</HI> and in all the ancient Authors; who unanimou&s;ly agree that <HI>Chaldea</HI> was call'd the <HI>Country of Ur,</HI> or the <HI>Country of Fire.</HI> And <HI>Ptolomy</HI> makes men|tion of a City in that Country which is call'd <HI>Urcoa,</HI> that is to &s;ay the place of <HI>Fire: ga,</HI> with a long or a double <HI>a,</HI> being a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> word, that &s;ignifies a <HI>Place,</HI> or <HI>Part of a Country.</HI> But the Ancient Names have been &s;o corrupted by the negligence or ignorance of Tran&s;cribers, or by the differences of Language and Pronuntiation of Authors and Tran&s;lators, that when we come to compare the Ancients with the modern Name, we mu&s;t not reject every thing that has not an entire Re&s;emblance. Now what we have already &s;aid &s;hews us the Errors of tho&s;e who have written, that <HI>Azer-beyan</HI> is the <HI>Northern</HI> Part of <HI>Syria,</HI> and that the word of <HI>Azer-beyan</HI> is deriv'd from <HI>Ardoebigara,</HI> which was the Capital City of the Country. The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> divide it into three parts <HI>Azer-beyan, Shirvan,</HI> and <HI>Shamalei.</HI> Strabo divides it only into two parts, <HI>the greater</HI> and the <HI>le&s;&s;er:</HI> but as for <HI>Ptolomie</HI> and other modern <HI>Geogrophers,</HI> they make no divi&s;ion of it at all.</P>
<P>The 14. we travell'd five leagues, through a Country full
<PB N="351" REF="165">
of little Hills, following the &s;ame cour&s;e as the days before, that it is to the <HI>North-We&s;t,</HI> leaving that &s;pacious Plain upon the left hand, which has been the Stage of &s;o many Bloody Battels, fought in the la&s;t ages; and in the beginning of this between the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> and <HI>Turks.</HI> The people of the Coun|try &s;hew you a great heap of Stones, &amp; affirm it to be the Place where that Battel began, between <HI>Selim</HI> the Son of <HI>So|lymon</HI> the Great, and <HI>I&s;mahel</HI> the Great. Our days Journey ended at <HI>Alacou.</HI> The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> a&s;&s;ert that this place was &s;o call'd <HI>Alacou,</HI> by that famous <HI>Tartar</HI> Prince who conquer'd a great Part of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and there founded a City, ruin'd during the Wars between the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI></P>
<P>The 15. our Journey was not &s;o long as the day before, but the way through which we travell'd was more &s;mooth and ea&s;ie. We lodg'd at <HI>Marant;</HI> which is a good fair Town, con&s;i&s;ting of about two thou&s;and five hundred hou&s;es, and which has &s;o many Gardens, that they take up as much ground as the Hou&s;es. It is &s;eated at the bottom of a little Hill, at the end of a Plain, which is a league broad and five long: and which is one of the mo&s;t lovely and faire&s;t that may be &s;een; a little River call'd <HI>Zelou-lou</HI> running through the middle of it: from which the people of the Country cut &s;everal Trenches to water their Grounds and their Gardens. <HI>Marant</HI> is better peopl'd than <HI>Nacchivan,</HI> and a much fairer Town. There grows about it great plenty of Fruits, and the be&s;t in all <HI>Media.</HI> But that which is mo&s;t peculiar to the&s;e Parts is this, that they gather <HI>Cocheneel</HI> in the Places adjoyning; though not in any great quantity, nor for any longer time then only eight days in the Summer, when the Sun is in <HI>Leo.</HI> Before that time the People of the Country a&s;&s;ure us, that it does not come to Maturity; and after that time the Worm from whence they draw the <HI>Cocheneel,</HI> makes a hole in the lea&s;e upon which it grows, and is lo&s;t. The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> call <HI>Cocheneel Quermis</HI> from <HI>Querm,</HI> which &s;ignifies a <HI>Worme,</HI> becau&s;e it is extracted out of <HI>Worms.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Marant</HI> is &s;eated 37. deg. 50. min. of Lat. and 81. deg. 15. min. of Longit. according to the ob&s;ervation of the <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI> Some take it for the City which <HI>Ptolemy</HI> calls <HI>Mandagarana.</HI> I made no Platform of it no more then I did of <HI>Nacchivan;</HI> becau&s;e neither their Fame nor their Beauty &s;eem'd to me to be worth any &s;uch Pains. The <HI>Armenians</HI> have a Tradition, that <HI>Noah</HI> lies buried there; and that the Name of the City is deriv'd from an <HI>Armenian</HI> word which &s;ignifies to <HI>bury.</HI> You may

<P>The 16. we travelled four Leagues, turning always among the Mountains, that come very clo&s;e one to another in &s;everal parts, but never joyn. By ten of the Clock in the morning we arriv'd at <HI>Sophian:</HI> a little Village &s;eated in a Plain, full of Rivulets and Gardens; the Soyl of which is fertile to a won|der. Some Authors believe it to be the Ancient <HI>Sophia</HI> of <HI>Me|dia.</HI> Others hold, that it was call'd <HI>Sophian</HI> from the <HI>Sophi's,</HI> who &s;ettled there, when <HI>I&s;mael</HI> the Fir&s;t left <HI>Ardevil,</HI> and re|mov'd his Court to <HI>Tauris.</HI></P>
<P>That Evening, Mr. <HI>Azarias,</HI> the hone&s;t Armenian, alrea|dy mention'd, went before with my Pa&s;ports and Letters of Recommendation from the Governors of <HI>Georgia</HI> and <HI>Armenia.</HI> I ordered him to find out the Toll-gatherer of <HI>Tauris,</HI> and to de&s;ire him in my Name, to give order that I might pa&s;s with my Retinue: and the next day I found he had di&s;charg'd his Tru&s;t, and that care had been taken to leave &s;uch orders at the Gates as I de&s;ir'd.</P>
<P>That day being the Seventeenth, we arriv'd at <HI>Tauris,</HI> after we had travell'd &s;ix Leagues upon the &s;ame Road, as the pre|ceding days, through fair and fertile Plains, where all the Lands were till'd, and where we had a Pro&s;pect of a great number of Villages. It is fifty three Per&s;ian Leagues, every one of which makes five thou&s;and Paces, between <HI>Irivan</HI> and <HI>Tauris,</HI> which may be ea&s;ily rid on Hor&s;eback in Six days, but the Caravans take double the Time. The Camels &s;eldom travel above four Leagues aday, and carry &s;ix or &s;even Hundred weight: the Hor&s;es and Mules &s;eldom carry above two Hundred and Twenty weight with a Man, and travel five or &s;ix Leagues a day.</P>
<P>The Figure in the Plate annex'd gives ye a very exact De|&s;cription of <HI>Tauris.</HI> It is really and truly a very large and Potent City: as being the &s;econd in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> both in Dignity, in Grandeur, in Riches, in Trade, and in number of Inhabi|tants. It is &s;eated at the end of a Plain, at the bottom of a Mountain, which our Modern Authors will have to be the Mountain <HI>Orontes</HI> or <HI>Barontes,</HI> according to <HI>Polybius, Diodorus,</HI> and <HI>Ptolomey.</HI> The Figure of it is irregular and difficult to be nam'd, as is apparent by the Plate; neither is it wall'd or for|tifi'd; only a little River call'd <HI>Spingtcha</HI> run acro&s;s it.

There is another that runs by the Nort-h&s;ide of the City; Which from the Spring till Autumn is not much larger then the <HI>Seine</HI> is at <HI>Paris</HI> in the Winter time. It is call'd <HI>Agi,</HI> or the <HI>Salt River,</HI> by rea&s;on of the Torrents that having run through &s;everal Salt Mar&s;hes empty them&s;elves into it; which is the Rea&s;on it breeds no Fi&s;h. The City is di&s;tingui&s;h'd into Nine Wards or Quarters, and divided, as are almo&s;t all the other Cities of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> into <HI>Haydar,</HI> and <HI>Neamet-Olahi,</HI> which are the names of two Factions, which divided all <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> in the Fifteenth Age, like the <HI>Guelphes</HI> and the <HI>Guibellines</HI> in <HI>Italy.</HI> It contains fifteen thou&s;and Hou&s;es, and fifteen Thou&s;and Shops. For the Hou&s;es in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> are not in the &s;ame place with their Shops; which &s;tand for the mo&s;t part in long and large arched Streets forty or fifty Foot high. Which Streets are call'd <HI>Ba&s;ar,</HI> or the Market, and make the heart of the City; the Hou&s;es being in the out Parts; and have almo&s;t all Gardens belonging to 'em. I did not &s;ee ma|ny Palaces or Magnificent Hou&s;es at <HI>Tauris.</HI> But there are the faire&s;t <HI>Ba&s;ars</HI> that are in any place of <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> And it is a lovely &s;ight to &s;ee their va&s;t Extent, their Largene&s;s, their beau|tiful <HI>Duomo's,</HI> and the Arches over 'em; the number of Peo|ple that are there all the day long, and the va&s;t quantities of Merchandize with which they are fill'd. The faire&s;t of all, and where they &s;ell their Jewels and Wares of greate&s;t value, is octangular, and very &s;pacious; being call'd the <HI>Kai&s;eri&eacute;,</HI> or <HI>Royal Market Place.</HI> It was built about the Year 850 of the <HI>Hegira</HI> by King <HI>Ha&s;&s;en,</HI> who kept his Court at <HI>Tauris.</HI> Their other Publick Buildings are no le&s;s Sumptuous, nor le&s;s full of People. There are reck'n'd to be in the City three hundred Caravan&s;erais; of which &s;ome are &s;pacious enough to lodge three hundred People. Their Cabarets for Coffee, Tobacco and &s;trong Liquors, the Baths and Mo&s;ques are an&s;werable to the beauty of the other Buildings.</P>

It was built in the year 878 of the <HI>Hegyra,</HI> by a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> King call'd <HI>Geoncha,</HI> or King of the World.

For they are built one over the other; and the uppermo&s;t is much higher and larger in the Diameter then that below, which &s;erves for a <HI>Ba&s;is</HI> to the other. There are al&s;o three Ho&s;pitals in the City, very neat and well in repair; however there is no body lodg'd within 'em, only they give Victuals to tho&s;e that come twice a day. The&s;e Ho&s;pitals at <HI>Tauris</HI> are call'd <HI>Ach-tucon,</HI> that is, <HI>Places where they &s;pend a great deal of Victuals.</HI> At the end of the City to the We&s;t, upon a little mountain &s;tands a Hermitage, a very neat piece of Work|man&s;hip, which they call <HI>Ayn Hali,</HI> or the <HI>Eyes</HI> of <HI>Haly.</HI> This <HI>Califf,</HI> whom their Prophet made his Son-in-Law, was as the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> report, the mo&s;t lovely man that was ever &s;een; &s;o that when they would &s;ignifie any thing that is extreamly hand&s;om they &s;ay tis <HI>Haly's Eyes.</HI> This Hermitage &s;erves the <HI>Tauri&s;ians</HI> for a place of Devotion, and the way to it for a walk of Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Without the City of <HI>Tauris</HI> to the Ea&s;t, appears a great Ca&s;tle almo&s;t gon to decay, which they call <HI>Cala-Ra&s;hid&eacute;.</HI> It was built above 400 years ago by <HI>Coj&eacute; Re&s;hid,</HI> Grand <HI>Vi&s;ier</HI> to King <HI>Kazan.</HI> The Story reports, that their King had five Grand <HI>Vi&s;irs,</HI> becau&s;e he did not believe that one could &s;uf|fice to di&s;patch all the affairs of &s;o great a Kingdom. <HI>Abas</HI> the Great &s;eeing that Ca&s;tle ruin'd, and judging it advantage|ou&s;ly &s;eated as well to defend the City, as to command it, caus'd it to be repair'd about fifty years &s;ince, but his Succe&s;&s;ors not being of his opinion, let it go to Ruin.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o to be &s;een the Ruins of the Principal Edifices and Fortifications, which the <HI>Turks</HI> built there, during the &s;e|veral times that they were Ma&s;ters of it. So that there are

very few Rocks or Poynts, of Mountains joyning to the City where nothing but the Ruins of Forts and Heaps of Rubbi&s;h are to be &s;een. Of which I carefully &s;urvey'd a great Part; but I could not di&s;cover any thing of Antiquity. There is nothing to be digg'd up but Bricks and Flint Stones. The onely Edi|fice that remains mo&s;t entire among the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Buildings is a large Mo&s;quee, the in&s;ide of which is inlay'd or rather par|getted with tran&s;parent Marble; and all the Out&s;ide variega|ted in Mo&s;aic work. But the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> account the Place de|fil'd, becau&s;e it was built by the <HI>Turks,</HI> who&s;e Faith they abo|minate. Among the heaps of Rubbi&s;h, of which I have &s;poken, without the City to the South, appear the Ruines of the Palace of the late Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> And to the Ea&s;t, tho&s;e of the Ca&s;tle where they &s;ay <HI>Co&s;roes</HI> lodg'd; and where he laid up the Holy Cros for Security, and all tho&s;e other &s;acred Spoyles which he brought away from <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Piazza</HI> of <HI>Tauris,</HI> is the mo&s;t &s;pacious Piazza that ever I &s;aw in any City of the World, and far &s;urpa&s;&s;es that of <HI>I&s;pa|han.</HI> The <HI>Turks</HI> have &s;everal times drawn up within it Thirty Thou&s;and Men in Battel. Toward the Evening this <HI>Piazza</HI> is fill'd with all the meaner &s;ort of People, that repair thither for Sport and Pa&s;time. Where &s;ome are for Gaming, &s;ome for Tricks of Activity, &s;ome for &s;eeing Jack-Puddings and Mountebanks act their Drolleries, &s;ome for Wre&s;tling, others for Bull and Ram-fighting, others for repeating Ver&s;es, &s;ome reciting Stories in Pro&s;e; and &s;ome to &s;ee Wolves dance. The People of <HI>Tauris</HI> take great delight to &s;ee that &s;ort of Sport; in&s;omuch that they bring tho&s;e Dancing Wolves a hundred Leagues an end, after they are well taught: And &s;uch as are be&s;t in&s;tructed are &s;old for five hunder'd Crowns a piece: &amp; many times al&s;o great Quarrels ari&s;e about the&s;e Wolves, which are not ea&s;ily appeas'd. Nor is this Piazza empty in the day time; as being a Market for all &s;orts of Provi&s;ions, and things of &s;mall Price. There is al&s;o another <HI>Piazza</HI> at <HI>Tauris,</HI> which appears in the Plate before the de|moli&s;h'd Ca&s;tle, call'd the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Jafer-Pacha.</HI> This was a Place for the Rendezvous, and exerci&s;e of the Souldiers be|longing to the Garri&s;on; now it &s;erves for the Shambles; where they kill and dre&s;s all &s;orts of large Meat, which is &s;old in all parts of the City.</P>
<P>I have with great diligence endeavour'd to under&s;tand the number of the Inhabitants in <HI>Tauris,</HI> but could never have a ju&s;t account; but I think I may truly reck'n it to amount to
<PB N="356" REF="171">
550 Thou&s;and Per&s;ons, yet &s;everal Per&s;ons in the City would make me believe there could not be le&s;s than Eleven hundred Thou&s;and.</P>
<P>The number of Strangers al&s;o which are there at all times is very great: for that they re&s;ort thither from all parts of <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> Nor do I know of any &s;ort of Merchandize, of which there is not there a Magazine to be found. The City is full of Arti&s;ts in Cotton, in Silk, and in Gold. The faire&s;t Turbans in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> are there made. And I have heard &s;everal of the Principal Merchants of the City affirm, that there are above &s;ix thou&s;and Bayles of Silk wrought out in Manufacture every year. The Trade of the City extends all over <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Turky;</HI> into <HI>Mu&s;covy, Tartary,</HI> to the <HI>In|dies,</HI> and over the <HI>Black-Sea.</HI></P>
<P>The Air of <HI>Tauris</HI> is cold and dry; very good and healthy: nor can any man complain that it contributes to any bad di&s;|po&s;ition of Humors. The Cold continues there a long time, in regard the City is expos'd to the North, for the Snow lies nine months in the year upon the tops of the Moun|tains that &s;urround it. The Wind blows almo&s;t every day, Morning and Evening. It al&s;o rains very often, unle&s;s it be in the Summer: nor is the Sky but &s;eldom without Clouds any &s;ea&s;on of the Year. It is &s;eated in 38. deg. of Latitude, and 82 of Longit. It abounds with all things nece&s;&s;ary for hu|man Support; &s;o that a Man may fare there deliciou&s;ly and very cheap. The <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, which is not above forty Leagues di&s;tant, affords 'em Fi&s;h. And &s;ome they al&s;o take in the River of <HI>Agi</HI> before mention'd; but that is only when the water is low. The u&s;ual price of Bread is three pound for a penny, and of a pound of Fle&s;h Three half pence. In the Summer there is great plenty of Veni&s;on and water Fowl. But they kill very little Veni&s;on or other wild Bea&s;ts. There are al&s;o Eagles in the Mountains; one which I have &s;een &s;old by the Country people for a groat.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons of Quality let fly the Sparrow-Hawk at the Eagle, which is a Flight full of Curio&s;ity and much to be admir'd. For the Sparrow-Hawk &s;oaring above the Eagle, &s;toops of a &s;udden with that &s;wiftne&s;s, &s;trikes her Pounces into his &s;ides, and with her wings continually beating upon his head &s;ends him in a &s;hort time to the ground: Yet &s;ometimes it happens that both the Eagle and the Sparrow-Hawk come both to the Earth together. In the &s;ame manner the Sparrow-Hawks will many times &s;top the flight of hunted Stags, and render the Chace
<PB N="357" REF="171">
much more ea&s;ie to the Pur&s;uers. But if this were &s;o ob|&s;ervable, that which I am going to &s;ay is no le&s;s remarkable: which is, That they a&s;&s;ur'd me, that in the parts adjoyn|ing to <HI>Tauris,</HI> there grow no le&s;s then three&s;core &s;orts of Grapes.</P>
<P>Not far from the City in the neighbouring Parts, are to be &s;een great Quarries of white Marble, of which there is a &s;ort that is tran&s;parent. The People of the Country af|firm it to be the water of a Mineral Fountain, congeal'd and hardne'd by degrees: and indeed, there are not far from it two con&s;iderable Mines, the one of Gold, and the other of Salt. But there has been no working in the Gold Mine for this long time, becau&s;e they always found, that the Profit ne|ver defray'd the Expences of the Labour. There are al&s;o &s;everal mineral Waters: Of which the mo&s;t frequented are tho&s;e of <HI>Baringe,</HI> half a League from <HI>Tauris;</HI> and tho&s;e of <HI>Seid-Kent,</HI> another Village, which is &s;ix Leagues from the City. The&s;e Waters are &s;ulphureous, but there are others that are cold; others boyling hot.</P>
<P>I do not know whether there be any City in the World, concerning the Original and fir&s;t Name of which, there is a greater Di&s;pute among Modern Authors. We &s;hall produce the Opinion of the mo&s;t celebrated: only it will not be ami&s;s in the fir&s;t place to take notice that the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> call the City <HI>Tebris,</HI> and that when we call it <HI>Tauris,</HI> as the People of <HI>Eu|rope</HI> generally do, it is only in compliance with the common Cu&s;tom; and to the end, I may be the better under&s;tood. <HI>Teixera, Olearius,</HI> and &s;ome other Authors maintain, that <HI>Tauris</HI> is that City which <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> in the fifth Table of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> calls <HI>Gabris,</HI> the <HI>G.</HI> being put in the &s;tead of <HI>T.</HI> an Alteration frequent in the Greek Language, as they a&s;&s;ert. <HI>Leonclavi|us, Jovius,</HI> and <HI>Aython,</HI> will have it to be that City which the &s;ame Ancient Geographer calls <HI>Terva,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>Tevra,</HI> by a tran&s;po&s;ition of the Letters of the word. But <HI>Terva</HI> being plac'd in <HI>Armenia,</HI> and it being certain that <HI>Tauris</HI> is &s;eated in <HI>Media,</HI> tho&s;e two Names can never be appropriated to the &s;ame City. So that without doubt, the Re&s;emblance of the word deceiv'd tho&s;e Authors. <HI>Tebris</HI> is a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> word; and was given to the City in the year 165. of the <HI>Hegyra,</HI> as we &s;hall declare more at large. And therefore, in regard it was &s;ever|al years ago &s;ince <HI>Ptolomy</HI> wrote, we mu&s;t believe that <HI>Terva</HI> and <HI>Gabris</HI> are both very different from <HI>Tauris. Niger</HI> a&s;&s;erts it to be <HI>Tigranoama;</HI> other Authors take it to be <HI>Tigranocerta.</HI>
<PB N="358" REF="172">
Some there are of Opinion that it is the <HI>Su&s;a</HI> of <HI>Media,</HI> &s;o fa|mous in Scripture: tho others believe it to be the City, which in the Book of <HI>E&s;dras</HI> is call'd <HI>Acmatha,</HI> or <HI>Amatha.</HI> Some place it in <HI>A&s;&s;yria,</HI> as <HI>Ptolomy</HI> and his Interpreter. Others in <HI>Ar|menia,</HI> as <HI>Niger Cedrenus, Aython,</HI> and <HI>Jovius. Marcus Paulus Venetus</HI> places it in the Country of the <HI>Parthians. Calchondylas</HI> removes it a little farther, that is to &s;ay, into the Province, of which <HI>Per&s;epolis</HI> was formerly the <HI>Metropolis.</HI> In &s;hort, there is a &s;trange Confu&s;ion in the Variety of Opinions upon this Subject. But the mo&s;t rational in my Opinion, is that of <HI>Molets,</HI> who has tran&s;lated and commented upon <HI>Ptolomy;</HI> of <HI>Ananias, Ortelius, Golnits, Teixera, de la Vall, Atlas,</HI> and al|mo&s;t all the modern Geographers, that <HI>Tauris</HI> is the Ancient and Celebrated <HI>Ecbatana,</HI> &s;o frequently mention'd in Holy Writ, and in the Ancient Sories of <HI>A&s;ia. Minadoi,</HI> an Italian Author, if I am not deceiv'd, has &s;et forth a Treati&s;e to prove it. However, give me leave to add this, that there are no Remainders to be &s;een at <HI>Tauris,</HI> either of the Magnificent Palace of <HI>Ecbatana,</HI> where the Monarchs of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> kept their Courts in Summer, nor of that of <HI>Daniel;</HI> which was after|wards the <HI>Mau&s;oleum</HI> for the Kings of <HI>Media,</HI> of which <HI>Jo&s;e|phus</HI> &s;peaks in his tenth Book; and which he a&s;&s;ures us &s;tood entire in his time. If then the&s;e &s;tately and magnificent Pa|laces were &s;tanding not above &s;ixteen Ages ago, in the Place where <HI>Tauris</HI> now &s;tands, the very Ruins them&s;elves are now not to found. For among all tho&s;e that are to be &s;een with|in the Circuit of that City, there are none but what are of Earth, Brick, or Flint, which were not Materials anciently made u&s;e of in <HI>Media</HI> for the building of &s;umptuous Pala|ces.</P>
<P>The Per&s;ian Hi&s;torians unanimou&s;ly agree the Time when the Foundations of <HI>Tauris</HI> were laid to be in the year 165. of the <HI>Hegyra:</HI> but they do not concur in other particulars. Some a&s;cribe the Foundation of it to the Wife of <HI>Haron-Re&s;hid, Califf</HI> of <HI>Bagdad,</HI> call'd <HI>Zebd-el-Caton,</HI> which &s;ignifies <HI>the Flower of Ladies.</HI> They report, that &s;he being de&s;perately &s;ick, a Median Phy&s;itian cur'd her in a &s;hort time. For which the Prince&s;s not knowing what Reward to give him, bid him make choice of his Recompence; where upon the Phy&s;itian de&s;ir'd that &s;he would build a City in his Country to the Ho|nor of his Memory. Which after &s;he had perform'd with great Care and Diligence, he call'd the City <HI>Tebris;</HI> as a Memorial that it ow'd its Original to <HI>Phy&s;ick.</HI> For that <HI>Teb</HI>
<PB N="359" REF="172">
&s;ignifies <HI>Phy&s;ic,</HI> and <HI>Ris</HI> is the Participle of <HI>Ricten, to power forth, &s;catter abroad,</HI> or <HI>give a Large&s;s.</HI> This is what &s;ome re|late; to which there are others that tell a Story not much unlike. For they &s;ay, that <HI>Halacoucan,</HI> General to <HI>Haron Re|&s;hid,</HI> having been two years &s;ick of a Tertian Ague, of which he never expected to be cur'd, was &s;trangely deliver'd from his Di&s;temper by an Herb, which he found in the &s;ame place where <HI>Tauris</HI> now &s;tands. And that to perpetuate the Me|mory of &s;uch a fortunate Cure, he built this City, and call'd it <HI>Tebrift; the Ague is gone.</HI> For <HI>Teb</HI> &s;ignifies al&s;o an <HI>A|gue,</HI> and <HI>rift</HI> comes from the Verb <HI>Reften, to go away.</HI> But that afterwards, either by Corruption, or becau&s;e it runs &s;mooth|er upon the Tongue, it was call'd <HI>Tebris</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>Tebrift.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mirzathaer,</HI> one of the mo&s;t Learned Per&s;ons of Quality that are in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> the Son of <HI>Mirza Ibrahim,</HI> Trea&s;urer of the Province, gave me another Rea&s;on of the Etymology: that is to &s;ay, that at the Time when this City was built, the Air was extremely whole&s;om and pre&s;ervative again&s;t Agues: Which extraordinary Quality drew a world of Peo|ple to it; and that therefore it was call'd <HI>Tebris,</HI> as if man &s;hould &s;ay, <HI>the Expeller of Agues.</HI> The &s;ame Lord al&s;o fur|ther a&s;&s;ur'd me, that there are in the Kings Trea&s;ury at <HI>I&s;pa|han,</HI> certain Medals with the In&s;cription of that <HI>Zebd-el-Ca|ton,</HI> which were found at <HI>Marant,</HI> a city near to <HI>Tauris,</HI> with a great number of others both of Gold and Silver, being the Coyns of the Ancient Kings of <HI>Media.</HI> And that he had ob|&s;erv'd others, with Greek Figures and In&s;criptions, wherein he remembred the word <HI>Dakianous.</HI> And then he ask'd me if I knew who that <HI>Dakianous</HI> was! To which I an&s;wer'd, that I did not under&s;tand the name, but that it might be very pro|bably the Name of <HI>Darius.</HI></P>
<P>In the 69. year after the Foundation of <HI>Tauris,</HI> the City was almo&s;t ruin'd by an Earth-quake. But <HI>Montevekel, Ca|liff</HI> of <HI>Bagdad,</HI> of the Race of the <HI>Abas's</HI> who then Reigned, not only repair'd but enlarg'd it. A hundred four&s;core and ten years after that, the 14 of the Month <HI>Sefer,</HI> another Earth|quake, more violent than the former, utterly ruin'd it in one night. The Per&s;ian Geography relates, how that at the &s;ame time there re&s;ided in the City, a Learned A&s;trologer of <HI>Shi|ras,</HI> call'd <HI>Aboutaher,</HI> or <HI>Just Father,</HI> who foretold that the &s;aid Earth-quake &s;hould happen upon the Sun's entrance in|to <HI>Scorpio,</HI> in the year 235. of the <HI>Hegyra;</HI> which an&s;wers to the year 849. of the Chri&s;tian <HI>Epoche;</HI> and &s;hould over|throw
<PB N="360" REF="173">
the whole City: To which, when he found the Peo|ple would give no Credit, he went and was importunat with the Governor, to force the People out of the City. The Governor, who was al&s;o the <HI>Califfs</HI> Lieutenant, over all the Province, being always a great Admirer of judicial A&s;trology, gave way to his Importunity, and did all the could to &s;end a|way the People into the Country: But finding that they &s;till lookt upon the Prediction of the Earth-quake to be a meer <HI>Chi|mera,</HI> and &s;u&s;pected &s;ome mi&s;chievous De&s;ign in the Governor, he could not per&s;wade above one half of the People to &s;tir; which fell out to their De&s;truction. For the Earth-quake hap|p'ned exactly at the Hour mention'd in the Prediction, to the overwhelming of forty thou&s;and Per&s;ons. The next year <HI>Emir Diueveron</HI> the Son of <HI>Mahamed-Rondain-Aredi,</HI> Vice-Roy of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> receiv'd Orders from the Calif, to rebuild it larger and fairer than it was before, and to know of that famous A&s;trologer <HI>Aboutaker,</HI> under what A&s;cendant he &s;hould begin to work: Who bid 'em begin when the Sun was in <HI>Scorpio,</HI> and a&s;&s;ur'd 'em the new City &s;hould never be troubled more with any Earth-quakes: but that it was threatned with great Inunda|tions of Water. To which the Hi&s;tory adds, that the Event has in all re&s;pects verifi'd the Truth of the Prediction. Af|ter this new Re&s;toration, <HI>Tauris</HI> came to be wonderfully en|larg'd, famous and flouri&s;hing. They a&s;&s;ure us, that in the Reign of <HI>Sultan Cazan,</HI> which is about 400 years ago, it ex|tended in breadth, North and South, from the little Moun|tain of <HI>Ain Ali,</HI> to the oppo&s;ite Mountain, call'd <HI>Tchurandog,</HI> and in length from the River <HI>Agi</HI> to the Village <HI>Baninge,</HI> which is two Leagues beyond the City. The &s;ame Hi&s;tory al&s;o ob|&s;erves, for a Proof of the multitude of the Inhabitants where-with that City was peopl'd, that the Pe&s;tilence happening among 'em, there dy'd 40 thou&s;and in one quarter, before they were mi&s;s'd.</P>
<P>In the year 896. of the <HI>Hegira,</HI> and 1490. of Chri&s;t, the Princes of the Race of <HI>Sheith-Sephi</HI> having invaded <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> re|mov'd the Seat of the Empire from <HI>Ardevil,</HI> which was their own Country, to this City. In the year 1514. <HI>Selim</HI> took it upon Compo&s;ition, two years after the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> who thought him&s;elf not &s;afe there, retir'd from thence, and &s;eated him&s;elf at <HI>Casbin. Selim</HI> &s;tay'd not long at <HI>Tauris,</HI> but he carry'd away with him a wealthy Booty, and three thou|&s;and Families of Artificers, the mo&s;t part <HI>Armenians,</HI> whom he &s;ettled in <HI>Constantinople.</HI> Soon after his Departure, the In|habitants
<PB N="361" REF="173">
of <HI>Tauris</HI> rebell'd, and falling unexpectedly upon the Turks, made a mo&s;t famous havock of the Enemy, and be|came Ma&s;ters of the City. But <HI>Ibraim Ba&s;ha,</HI> General to <HI>So|liman</HI> the Magnificent, &s;everely reveng'd this Rebellion in the Year 955. of the <HI>Hegyra,</HI> and Year of our Lord 1548. For he took the City by A&s;&s;ault, and gave the Plunder of it to his Army; who committed therein all manner of Inhumanity, even to an Exce&s;s unheard of before. In a word, all that could be call'd Cruelty, Fire and Sword was there put in Execution. The Palace of King <HI>Tahmas,</HI> and all the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Stru|ctures were de&s;troy'd, and levell'd with the Earth. Yet not|with&s;tanding all the&s;e Calamities, the City lifted up her head again at the beginning of <HI>Amuraths</HI> Reign, and with the A&s;|&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome few Per&s;ian Troops, put to the Sword all the Turki&s;h Garri&s;on, con&s;i&s;ting of Ten thou&s;and men. <HI>A|murath</HI> di&s;may'd at the Courage of the <HI>Tauri&s;ians,</HI> &s;ent a power|ful Army under the leading of <HI>O&s;man,</HI> his <HI>Grand</HI> Vi&s;ir, utterly to de&s;troy, and wholly to &s;ubdue the Inhabitants. This Ar|my enter'd the City and pillag'd it, in the Year 994. by the Mahometan Accompt, and the Year of our Lord 1585. at what time the Vi&s;ir caus'd all the Fortifications which the Turks had rai&s;ed before to be repair'd. But eighteen years after this Expedition, in the Year 1603. <HI>Abas</HI> the Great re|took <HI>Tauris</HI> from the Turks with a &s;mall Force, but with that Policy, Diligence and Bravery, which is hardly to be credited. He divided the &s;toute&s;t of his Soldiers into &s;everal &s;mall Bo|dies, who &s;urpriz'd the <HI>Corps du Guard,</HI> and cut their Throats in &s;uch a moment of time, that they had no notice of it in the Town. The&s;e Troops were follow'd by a Body of five hundred Men, di&s;guiz'd like Merchants, who enter'd the Ci|ty with a plau&s;ible Story, that they had left the <HI>Caravan</HI> a days journey behind. Which the Turks readily believ'd, be|cau&s;e it is the Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Caravans,</HI> that upon their Ap|proach near to Great Cities, the Merchants go before; be&s;ides that, the Turks never dreamt but that they had been examin'd by the <HI>Corps du Guard. Abas</HI> follow'd clo&s;e, and &s;eeing his men were enter'd, flew into the City at the head of &s;ix thou|&s;and Men; while two of his Generals did the &s;ame on two other &s;ides of the Town. So that the Turks, finding them|&s;elves &s;urpri&s;'d, &s;urrender'd only upon condition of &s;paring their Lives. And the Hi&s;tory farther ob&s;erves, that in this Expedition it was, that that &s;ame Potent Prince fir&s;t order'd one Brigade of his Army to carry Mu&s;quets, and finding the
<PB N="362" REF="174">
good Effect of 'em, order'd a mixture of fire-Arms among all his Forces. Whereas before the Per&s;ians never made u&s;e of Guns in any of their Wars.</P>
<P>Now that we may not omit any thing in the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Tauris,</HI> that is worthy Ob&s;ervation, it behoves us al&s;o to let ye know, what the <HI>Armenian</HI> Authors have wrote concerning it. They report that this City is one of the mo&s;t Ancient in all <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and that it was formerly call'd <HI>Sha-Ha&s;ten,</HI> or the <HI>Royal Place,</HI> for that the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Monarchs there kept their Court: and that afterwards a King of <HI>Armenia,</HI> who was call'd <HI>Co&s;|roes,</HI> chang'd the Name of it from <HI>Sha-Ha&s;ten</HI> into <HI>Tauris,</HI> which in the <HI>Armenian</HI> Language &s;ignifies a <HI>Place of Revenge,</HI> for that he there defeated the King of <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> who had murder'd his Brother. The Government of the Province of <HI>Tauris,</HI> is the Chiefe&s;t in all the Empire, and annext to the Dignity of the Captain General-&s;hip. It brings him in thirty thou&s;and To|mans Yearly, which amount to much above a Million &s;terling, be&s;ides Ca&s;ualties, which are very con&s;iderable in the A&s;iatic Governments. The Governor bears the Title of <HI>Becler|bec.</HI> He maintains three thou&s;and Hor&s;e; and has under him the Governors or <HI>Kan</HI>'s of <HI>Cars, Oroumi, Maraga, Ardevil,</HI> and Twenty <HI>Sultans,</HI> who altogether maintain eleven Thou&s;and Hor&s;e more.</P>
<P>I lodg'd at the <HI>Capuchins</HI> Inn, who were arriv'd before me. They were no more then two, whom I de&s;ir'd to keep my Ar|rival private, for about fifteen days. Which I did to put my &s;elf into an Equipage, and my Things in the &s;ame Order, as they were before my misfortunes in <HI>Mingrelia;</HI> as al&s;o to me|thodize tho&s;e things which I had brought for the King, to the end I might &s;hew 'em to the be&s;t advantage at Court. But my arrival could not be concealed. For <HI>Mirzathaer,</HI> Son of the Trea&s;urer, and Receiver-General of the Province, and admit|ted by way of Survivor-&s;hip, under&s;tood that there were Strang|ers at the <HI>Capuchins</HI> Inn. And therefore he &s;ent the 22d to tell the Superior, that he wonder'd at his neglect in not coming to give him notice of the Arrival and Quality of the <HI>Europe|ans,</HI> which he entertain'd in his Hou&s;e. To whom the Father excus'd him&s;elf, and farther told the Me&s;&s;enger, that for my part, I had not fail'd to wait upon him; had I not been ill di&s;po|&s;ed; but in a few days I would attend and pay him my Re&s;pects.</P>
<P>The 23. the &s;ame Lord, whom I had the honour to know in my fir&s;t Travels, made me a Vi&s;it, together with the Son of the Can of <HI>Guenj&eacute;,</HI> and &s;hew'd me great Civilities. He &s;ate
<PB N="363" REF="174">
two hours in my Chamber, while I gave him an account of the affairs of Europe, particularly concerning Arts and Sci|ences. After which he was &s;o kind as to tell me the good fortune that had befall'n his Family, and his Brothers Em|ployments.

But he importun'd me &s;o earne&s;tly, and with an a&s;&s;ability &s;o becoming, that I could not refu&s;e him.

<P>The 25. we heard while we &s;tay'd with tho&s;e Lords, the Confirmation, and full Relation of a Robbery reported a month before, and committed the <HI>December</HI> preceding upon the Great <HI>Caravan</HI> that goes from <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> to the <HI>Indies</HI> by land. This <HI>Caravan</HI> &s;ets out once a Year in <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> and goes through <HI>Candabar</HI> which is in <HI>Bactriana.</HI> The Robbery was very con|&s;iderable, as well for the Number of Per&s;ons, for the va&s;t wealth that was in the <HI>Caravan,</HI> as al&s;o for the Con&s;equences that en&s;u'd. It was committed three days journey from the <HI>Frontiers</HI> of <HI>India,</HI> by the <HI>Agvan,</HI> a &s;ort of People much like the <HI>Tartars,</HI> but tributary to the <HI>Per&s;ian.</HI> They had intelligence which way the <HI>Caravan</HI> march'd, and &s;urpriz'd it in a very ad|vantageous
<PB N="364" REF="175">
place for &s;uch a de&s;ign. They were in all five hundred Men, all well Mounted and well Re&s;olv'd. The <HI>Caravan</HI> had a Convoy of about two hunderd, and con&s;i&s;ted of about two thou&s;and Per&s;ons, for the mo&s;t part <HI>Indians.</HI> The Convoy made no Re&s;i&s;tance, but betook them&s;elves to Flight: and the mo&s;t part of the <HI>Caravan,</HI> following the Exam|ple of tho&s;e that &s;hould have defended 'em, &s;hifted every one for them&s;elves. So that there were but eleven kill'd, &s;o &s;mall was the Re&s;i&s;tence made. Nor was it a thing to be wonder'd at. For the <HI>Caravan</HI>'s, and particularly tho&s;e of the <HI>Indians,</HI> are compos'd of <HI>Armenians</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> people that for the mo&s;t part will be Scar'd with a &s;tick. And they that had any Cou|rage were left alone and abandon'd by tho&s;e that &s;hould have a&s;&s;i&s;ted 'em; So that every Man &s;trove to &s;ave one, and hap|py he that could &s;hift for him&s;elf. The Robbery was valu'd at &s;everal hundred thou&s;ands of Pounds: but the true and ju&s;t account could never be known, the Merchants upon &s;uch occa&s;ions u&s;ually di&s;gui&s;ing the Truth, &s;ome becau&s;e they are afraid of loo&s;ing their Credit, others for fear it &s;hould be di&s;|cover'd, that they conceal a part of what they &s;end to &s;ave Cu&s;toms and Toll. The Inventory which was given into the King, &s;ign'd by above &s;ixty Per&s;ons concern'd, amounted to no le&s;s then three hundred thou&s;and <HI>Toman</HI>'s, or a million four hundred thou&s;and Pound &s;terling; yet we were a&s;&s;ur'd it was but the half of the Lo&s;s. The Governor of <HI>Candabar</HI> was accus'd to have been acce&s;&s;ory to the Robbery. The King therefore &s;ent for to have him apprehended and brought to <HI>I&s;|pahan</HI> upon a Camel chain'd about the Neck, with one Servant which he had the Liberty to make choice of. It was affirm'd that they who comitted the Robbery them&s;elves, were a &s;ort of People &s;o ignorant, that they under&s;tood not what belong'd either to Gold or Precious Stones. They divided the Coyn'd Money one among another, Gold and Silver intermix'd toge|ther by weight, without any di&s;tinction of Mettal, and jum|bled the true Pearls with the fal&s;e ones, without making any Difference. I mu&s;t confe&s;s I could hardly believe this, nor had I reported it, if it had not been univer&s;ally and con&s;tantly a|vow'd by all the People I di&s;cours'd with upon this occa&s;ion.</P>

'Tis true we all knew well enough, but we had no mind to tell, knowing wherefore they &s;ought for him; which
<PB N="365" REF="175">
was for no other rea&s;on then to apprehend him; and carry him Pri&s;oner to <HI>Erivan.</HI> He had made his e&s;cape &s;ix days before, vex'd to the very Soul to find, that while the Go|vernor pretended to take &s;o much care to pay his debts, he minded nothing more then how to &s;queeze a good Sum of Money for him&s;elf. For the Governor according to the foremention'd Order from the Court, had &s;ent to &s;eve|ral Per&s;ons about <HI>Irivan,</HI> to Levy the money for payment of the Patriarch's debts upon the <HI>Armenian</HI> Villages. But the Officers entru&s;ted to rai&s;e the Money had &s;o far out-&s;tretch'd their Commi&s;&s;ion, in the outrages and violences which they committed, as to demand and levy double the &s;um which was impos'd. All which the Patriarch well knew: but conniv'd at it, for the advantage he was to receive thereby. And he would fain have been handling the fir&s;t Money that was brought to <HI>Erivan;</HI> but the Governor was &s;o far from &s;uffering him to meddle, that he would not pay above half to the Cu&s;tomer of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI>'s Tru&s;tees. So that of three thou&s;and five hundred pounds which were rais'd for his Sati&s;|faction, he would not part with above two thou&s;and for the payment of the debts. The Patriarch complain'd of this Inju&s;tice, but could have no Remedy. All the Governor &s;aid to him was this, that if the Cu&s;tomer of <HI>Constantinople</HI> were pai'd in time 'twas as much as he could require, and that it did not belong to him to take Cognizance what was levy'd for that purpo&s;e. But perhaps he could not chu&s;e but be di&s;turb'd with the Cryes and Cur&s;es of his own Nation: for they were bitterly enrag'd again&s;t him, and his Proceedings. And therefore he re&s;olv'd to appea&s;e 'em &amp; withdraw him&s;elf from the oppre&s;&s;ion of the Governor of <HI>Armenia,</HI> which made him make his e&s;cape, with a de&s;ign to make his Complaints to the Court. The Governor on the other &s;ide, having notice of his flight, &s;ent away to the neighbouring Governors to &s;top him; and he happen'd to be at <HI>Tauris,</HI> when the Expre&s;s arriv'd there. But the <HI>Armenian</HI> Inhabitants of the City pre|&s;erv'd him, not &s;o much by concealing him in any private ab&s;conding Place, as by their Pre&s;ents to the Grandees, and for that the Inju&s;tice that was done him in his private affairs, was &s;o publickly notorious, that it was no more then what was rea&s;onable for them, to let him have his Liberty to go to <HI>I&s;pa|han</HI> for Redre&s;s.</P>

He is a Per&s;onage the mo&s;t eminent for his Witt and Valour of any other in the whole Kingdom. He is Brother to the Governor of <HI>Candabar,</HI> who was accus'd for being Acce&s;&s;ory to the Robbing of the <HI>Indian Caravan.</HI> His Father was Governor of <HI>Armenia;</HI> and <HI>Abas</HI> had a great affection for this <HI>Ru&s;tan-Bec,</HI> for the &s;ake of his Learning, his Courage, and his Gracefull A&s;pect. Nor was it a|bove a year before, that the King had given him a Commi&s;&s;i|on to go into the Province of <HI>Azer-beyan,</HI> to take a review of the Forces and Ammunitions there; and now his Commi&s;&s;i|on was out, by which as I under&s;tood, he had gotten above ten thou&s;and pounds. His Company and Di&s;cour&s;e ex|treamly pleas'd me; for he &s;hew'd me &s;everal Mapps of the Province which he had newly made of which he promis'd me copies; and reaching down a Plain-Sphere, which had been lately printed in <HI>Europe,</HI> he &s;hew'd me &s;everal Faults in it: I al&s;o &s;upp'd with him, nor would he let me go til mid|night.</P>
<P>The 7. he did me the Honnor to give me a Vi&s;it, and to &s;pend all the Afternoon in my Chamber.</P>
<P>The 8, and the three days following, I made it my bu&s;i|ne&s;s to fetch away &s;uch parcels of Goods from <HI>Tahmas-Bec,</HI> and <HI>Mirza-thaer,</HI> which they refus'd to buy, after I had bar|gain'd with 'em for what they made choice of; tho all that I &s;old to both came but to a thou&s;and Crowns, and that with|out Profit. So that I had much ado to agree with 'em; however I was paid when we all concluded. The one pre|tended in abatement of my price, his Fathers being a Favourite at Court; the other the great Credit which his Brothers and his Unckle <HI>Mirza-Sadec,</HI> being Lord High Chancellor, had with the King; and forc'd me to take Letters of Recommen|dation, which they freely offer'd to compen&s;ate the Profit which I &s;hould have got by my goods. For a man would hard|ly believe the Care&s;&s;es, the Flattery, the engaging and familiar Behaviour, which the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> Grandees will conde&s;cend to, for their own Intere&s;ts, how &s;light &s;oever.

<P>The 29. we travell'd five leagues; cro&s;&s;ing over a little Hill at fir&s;t; but afterwards over Plains that were wonderful plea&s;ant, fertil and cover'd with Villages; that where we lodg'd being call'd <HI>Agi-agach.</HI> The&s;e Plains are the be&s;t Pa&s;ture-Grounds in <HI>Media,</HI> if I may not pre&s;ume to &s;ay in the world.

After two hours travel we pa&s;s'd by the Ruins of a great City, which they &s;aid had flouri&s;h'd there in former times; but being almo&s;t ruin'd was utterly de&s;troy'd by <HI>Abas.</HI> Upon the left hand of the Road are to be &s;een large Circles of Hew'n Stone; which the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> affirm to be a great &s;ign, that the <HI>Caous</HI> making war in <HI>Media,</HI> held a Coun&s;el in that place: it being the Cu&s;tom of tho&s;e People, that every Officer that came to the Council brought with him a Stone to &s;erve him in&s;tead of a Chair. And the&s;e <HI>Caous</HI> were a &s;ort of <HI>Gyants. Herodotus</HI> al&s;o reports &s;omthing like to this, of a Per&s;ian Army that went again&s;t the <HI>Scythians;</HI> for he tells you that the Army being in <HI>Thrace, Darius</HI> &s;hew'd 'em a place, and commanded that every one &s;hould lay a Stone therein as he pa&s;s'd along. But that which is mo&s;t to be ad|mir'd, after ob&s;ervation of the&s;e Stones, is this, that they are &s;o big that eight Men can hardly move one, and yet there is no place from whence they can be imagin'd to have been fetch'd, but from the next Mountains, that are &s;ix Leagues off. We met upon the Road, with three large and fair Inns, and lodg'd at a Village call'd <HI>Caratchiman,</HI> &s;eated at the Foot of a little Hill: it was not &s;o big as <HI>Va&s;pinge,</HI> but altogether as plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>The 31. we travel'd four Leagues over Hills and Dales, all fertil and delightful to admiration. In the mid-way we
<PB N="372" REF="179">
pa&s;s'd through a Village full of Popler Groves and Gard|ens, and well water'd. It was call'd <HI>Turcman,</HI> becau&s;e that in the Fields that environ it, there are a great number of Shep|herds with their Flocks that are call'd by that Name. We &s;topp'd at <HI>Pervar&eacute;,</HI> another Village, as hand&s;ome and as large as <HI>Turcman,</HI> &s;eated al&s;o in a bottom at the foot of a Hill, all a|long by the Banks of a little River.</P>
<P>The 1. of <HI>June</HI> We travell'd two Leagues in a level Coun|try, as even as that we had cro&s;s'd the day before; and four Leagues among the Mountains where the way was rugged and very unea&s;ie. A little River but very rapid pa&s;&s;es through the Mid&s;t of it; and by rea&s;on of it's winding cour&s;e oblig'd us to pa&s;s it &s;everal times, to &s;horten our way. We alighted at <HI>Miana.</HI> This is a Town &s;eated in the middle of a fair and large Plain encompa&s;&s;ed with Mountains, which upon that Road &s;eparates <HI>Media</HI> from the Countrey of the <HI>Parthians.</HI> Which is the rea&s;on that the Village car|rys that Name, for that <HI>Miane</HI> properly &s;ignifies, the par|ting of &s;everal Countries. To this Town there belongs a kind of Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e, where the Officers are &s;aid to be very tyrannical in their exactions upon the meaner &s;ort of People that travel that way. But they under&s;tood who the Gentle|man was who travel'd with me, and who I was; So that they dur&s;t not &s;o much as &s;hew them&s;elves; for there is that good order tak'n in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and almo&s;t all over the Ea&s;t; that the Receivers of all Sorts of Tolls and Duties, have no per|mi&s;&s;ion or Authority to demand any thing of any eminent Per&s;on, of any Officer of the Kings, how incon&s;iderable &s;oever his office may be, nor of any Stranger of Quality. For &s;hould they be &s;o bold, as to examin what they carry'd, the offence would be puni&s;h'd with Ba&s;tinados.</P>
<P>The 2. we &s;pent &s;o much time in fording the River of <HI>Miana,</HI> and found the Mountain beyond it, that we were to cro&s;s, to be &s;o rugged, that we could not travel above three Leagues. We were two hours before we could find the Ford, and get our Sumpters over, which at length we got over &s;afe without any Damage, thanks be to God; and five hours cro&s;&s;ing the Mountain which was very high, and very &s;teep, being the Bounds between <HI>Media</HI> and <HI>Parthia.</HI> The&s;e two &s;pacious Provinces are parted by a Ridge of Moun|tains, which are a Branch of Mount <HI>Taurus,</HI> that extends it &s;elf from <HI>Europe</HI> to <HI>China,</HI> cro&s;&s;ing, as has been &s;aid, <HI>Circa&s;&s;ia, Mingrelia, Georgia,</HI> the Country of the <HI>Parthians, Bactriana,</HI>
<PB N="373" REF="179">
the Province of <HI>Candabar,</HI> and the <HI>Indies.</HI> At the top of the Mountain upon the point of a Rock, we &s;py'd a large ruin'd Ca|&s;tle, which the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> call the <HI>Virgins Ca&s;tle,</HI> alledging that <HI>Ar|taxerxes</HI> caus'd it to be built to impri&s;on therein a Prince&s;s of the Blood. But <HI>Abas</HI> the Great caus'd it to be utterly demoli|&s;hed, as &s;erving only for a Retreat to a number of Robbers that made them&s;elves as it were &s;overaign Lords of the Moun|tain. On both &s;ides of the Mountain are large Cau&s;eys, which that great Prince caus'd to be made, for the ea&s;e of Travellers in the Winter. Towards the end of our journey we pa&s;s'd a large River, call'd <HI>Ke&s;il-beu&s;&egrave;</HI> over a fair Bridge, and lay at <HI>Semel&eacute;.</HI> Which is an Inn or <HI>Caravan&s;eray</HI> built near the Bridge to lodge Travellers that can reach no farther.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Ke&s;il-beuz&eacute;</HI> is much larger and more rapid than that of <HI>Miana,</HI> and &s;erves to bound <HI>Media</HI> from the Country of the Parthians. And now no &s;ooner have you pa&s;s'd this River, but you may ea&s;ily perceive the change of the Air. For whereas the Temperature of <HI>Media</HI> is &s;omewhat moy&s;t and cloudy, which is the rea&s;on of high Winds and much Rain, and that the Soil is fruitful of it &s;elf, whatever anci|ent Authors have wrote to the contrary, the Parthian Air is dry to the extreme&s;t degree; in&s;omuch that for &s;ix Months to|gether you &s;hall neither &s;ee any Rain or any Clouds: but the Soil is &s;andy, and Nature produces nothing without good Hu&s;|bandry and Pains.</P>
<P>The Country of the Parthians, which was &s;o long the Seat of the Empire of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> is the large&s;t and principal Province of the Per&s;ian Monarchy. It is all the proper demeans of the King, nor has it any Governor, as the mo&s;t part of the re&s;t of the Provinces. The Per&s;ians bound it to the Ea&s;t, by the Pro|vince of <HI>Cora&s;&s;on,</HI> or <HI>Coromitrena;</HI> to the South, by that of <HI>Fars;</HI> which is properly <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> to the We&s;t, by <HI>Azerbeyan</HI> or <HI>Media;</HI> to the North, by <HI>Guilan,</HI> and <HI>Maganderaan,</HI> which compo&s;e the Province of <HI>Hyrcania.</HI> This Province extends it &s;elf at lea&s;t two hundred Leagues in length, and an hun|dred and fifty Leagues in breadth. The Air is very dry, and and the mo&s;t healthy for the mo&s;t part of any in the world. It is more mountainous then level. The Mountains are al&s;o very bare, and to &s;peak in general terms, produce nothing but Thi&s;tles and Briers: but the Plains are very fertile and plea&s;ant, where there is any Water: otherwi&s;e the Soyl is ve|ry barren. This large Province contains above forty Cities, which is very much in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> as not being an Empire peopl'd proportionably to its Extent.</P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="180">
The <HI>Orientals</HI> call the Country of <HI>Parthia Arac-agem;</HI> that is to &s;ay, <HI>Per&s;ian Arack.</HI> They call it likewi&s;e <HI>Balad-el-Gebel,</HI> or the <HI>Country of the Mountains,</HI> for the rea&s;on's already recited. My Opinion is, that the <HI>Scythians,</HI> from whom, as ancient Au|thors hold, the <HI>Parthians</HI> deriv'd their Original, were the <HI>le&s;|&s;er Tartars,</HI> that inhabit to the North of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> now call'd <HI>Yuzbecs,</HI> and formerly <HI>Bactrians;</HI> and that that &s;ame <HI>Ar&s;aces,</HI> who founded the Empire of the <HI>Parthians,</HI> was a Native of the &s;ame Country with <HI>Tamerlan, Halacou</HI> and tho&s;e other Tartar Princes, that made &s;uch great and famous Conque&s;ts in the Ages la&s;t pa&s;t.</P>
<P>The <HI>3d.</HI> we travell'd four Leagues keeping on to the South, as when we fir&s;t &s;et out of <HI>Tauris:</HI> the Road was very good, only we had Mountains very near us upon the right and left hand. We lay at <HI>Sir&s;ham;</HI> which is a large Inn, adjoyning to three or four &s;mall Villages, but &s;eated in a &s;andy and dry Soyl; and there the Officers that gather the Duties upon Goods tran&s;ported out of the Kingdom keep their Po&s;t.</P>
<P>The <HI>4th.</HI> we travell'd &s;even Leagues, through bu&s;hy Plains and Sands; and we were forc'd to make &s;everal windings and turnings, by rea&s;on of &s;everal Mole-Hills and little Sand-Hills in our way. Neverthele&s;s both on one the &s;ide and t'other, at a di&s;tance we could &s;ee a Champian Country, very delight|ful and fertile, and Villages here and there which yielded a very delightful Pro&s;pect; the River <HI>Zenjan</HI> wat'ring tho&s;e Vil|lages. We lay at a large <HI>Caravan&s;eray</HI> call'd <HI>Nich&egrave;,</HI> built be|tween five &s;pacious Villages.</P>
<P>The <HI>5th.</HI> we travell'd &s;ix Leagues through a Road more plea&s;ant and le&s;s crooked, and ob&s;erving the &s;ame Cour&s;e as the day before; and lodg'd at <HI>Zerigan,</HI> a little City, that con|tains not above two thou&s;and Hou&s;es. It is &s;eated in a very narrow Plain between two Mountains that enclo&s;e it, not above half a League one from the other. The Soyl of <HI>Zerigan</HI> is fertile and plea&s;ant, and the Air whol&s;ome and cool in the Summer. The City without is &s;urrounded with Gardens, that yield both Plea&s;ure and Profit, but within the Town there is nothing remarkable but the great Ruins.</P>
<P>The Hi&s;tory of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> records this City to have been founded in the Reign of <HI>Ardechir-babezon,</HI> &s;everal Ages be|fore Chri&s;t; and farther adds, that it con&s;i&s;ted of twenty thou|&s;and Hou&s;es, which is very probable, for that heaps of Rub|bi&s;h, and Ruins are to be &s;een for a mile together round about

it. <HI>Tamerlan</HI> the fir&s;t time he pa&s;&s;ed through it, utterly demo|li&s;h'd it: but the &s;econd time, that is to &s;ay, in his Return out of Turkey, he order'd a part of it to be rebuilt, under&s;tanding that it had been for a time a flouri&s;hing Nur&s;ery of Arts and Sciences; and had produced &s;everal learned and famous Men. For which rea&s;on it is much celebrated among the Ea&s;tern Au|thors. The <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars</HI> thatravag'd <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> &s;ince <HI>Tama</HI> &s;ack'd and de&s;troy'd it &s;everal times, and it is no longer ago then &s;ince the beginning of this la&s;t Age, that they began to rebuild it.</P>
<P>The <HI>6th.</HI> Our road lay through a Country, the mo&s;t lovely delightful that every Eye beheld, through a fair Plain where the road was level and very &s;traight. Several plea&s;ant Streams glide through it, that render the Soyl very fertil. The whole Plain is &s;o &s;trow'd with Villages, that they are hardly to be number'd, with &s;o many Groves and Gardens, that for me the mo&s;t plea&s;ant Land-skips, and charming Pro&s;pects in the World. We alighted after a journey of five Leagues at a <HI>Cara|van&s;erai</HI> call'd <HI>Queurk-boulag,</HI> over again&s;t and within a good Ca|nons &s;hot of <HI>Sultanie.</HI></P>
<P>This City is &s;eated at the foot of a Mountain, as you may &s;ee by the Draught which I have made of it. It &s;eems a far off very neat and well built, and inflames a Man with a Cu|ro&s;ity to &s;ee it: but when you approach near it, it cea&s;es to be the &s;ame thing, and appears le&s;s beautiful then when ye are within it. Yet there are &s;ome publick Buildings very remarka|ble, as well for the Structure as the Architecture, together with about three thou&s;and Habitations. The people of the Coun|try affirm, that this City took up formerly half a League of Ground more to the We&s;t then it does, and that the ruin'd Churches, Mo&s;ques and Towers, which are to be &s;een at that di&s;tance on that &s;ide, &s;tood in the heart of the City. Which probably may be true, &s;eeing that Hi&s;tories a&s;&s;ure us that it was once the Metropolis and bigge&s;t City of the Kingdom: nor are there many Cities in the world, where there are va&s;ter Ru|ins to be &s;een. Provi&s;ion al&s;o is there very plentiful and ve|ry cheap. The Air is likewi&s;e very whole&s;ome, but &s;ubject to change. For in all the Sea&s;ons it changes almo&s;t every hour. The Evenings, Nights and Mornings being cold, but all the day long very hot; from one Extreme to another. <HI>Sul|tany</HI> lies in 36. deg. 18. min. of Latitude. and 48. deg. 5. min. of Longitude, and is govern'd by a <HI>Sultan.</HI></P>
<P>Some Hi&s;tories of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> relate, that this City is one of the mo&s;t ancient in all the Country of the <HI>Parthians;</HI> but that it
<PB N="376" REF="183">
is not known who was the Founder. Others on the other &s;ide affirm, that the foundations of it were laid when the Sun was in <HI>Leo,</HI> by the order, and in the Reign of <HI>Ergon-Can,</HI> the Son of <HI>Abkei-Can,</HI> and Grand-child of <HI>Halacou-Can;</HI> and that becau&s;e it could not be fini&s;h'd in his days, his Son <HI>Jangou-Sultan</HI> compleated the work and call'd it <HI>Sultania,</HI> or the <HI>Royal City.</HI> For <HI>Sultan</HI> properly &s;ignifies a King: from whence comes <HI>Seltenet,</HI> the u&s;ual Per&s;ian word for a <HI>Kingdom</HI> or <HI>Monarchy.</HI> And the Monarchs of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> who reign'd &s;ince the &s;eventh Age, a&s;&s;um'd to them&s;elves the Titles of <HI>Souldans,</HI> from whence came the Ti|tle of <HI>Soldan</HI> given to the la&s;t King's of <HI>Egypt;</HI> and that of the Emperors of Turkey, who call them&s;elves <HI>Sultans.</HI> Neverthe|le&s;s I have heard &s;ome learned Men &s;ay, that this City was never call'd <HI>Sultani&eacute;</HI> or <HI>Royal,</HI> till the time that the la&s;t Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> who al&s;o a&s;&s;um'd the title of <HI>Sultans,</HI> came to keep their Courts in this Place. On the other &s;ide, if this City were built out of the Ruins of <HI>Tigranocerta,</HI> as &s;everal Modern <HI>European</HI> Authors maintain, it may be &s;aid that the name which now it bears, was form'd out of that Ancient Name. For <HI>Certa</HI> in old <HI>Pr&s;ian,</HI> &s;ignifies a City, &s;o that <HI>Tigranoterta</HI> &s;ignifies no more then the City of <HI>Tigranes,</HI> who was King of <HI>Armenia,</HI> as is well known to every ordinary Reader. However I cannot tell, how it is po&s;|&s;ible for us to take <HI>Sultani&eacute;</HI> for <HI>Tigranocerta;</HI> &s;ince <HI>Tacitus</HI> tells us that <HI>Tigranocerta</HI> was but thirty &s;even Miles from <HI>Ni|&s;ibis,</HI> a City which every one knows to be &s;eated in <HI>Me&s;opota|mia,</HI> upon the River <HI>Tigris,</HI> 25 Leagues from <HI>Nineve.</HI> And therefore I mu&s;t &s;ay, as I &s;aid before, the Geography of the Ancients is the mo&s;t confu&s;ed thing in the world; the Wri|ters were misinform'd, and it is impo&s;&s;ible to bring 'em to a|gree together. I &s;hould not a&s;&s;ert this &s;o confidently, did I not &s;ee, that other Modern Relators commit al&s;o very great Errors in what they publi&s;h, either upon the ob&s;ervations or report of others: &s;o that there is not not any one from whom I might not produce examples &s;ufficient to confirm this Truth.</P>
<P>This City has been &s;everal times laid in heaps: Fir&s;t, <HI>Cotza Re&s;hid</HI> King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> whom other Hi&s;torians call <HI>Giau&s;an;</HI> for that it had rebell'd, and tak'n up Arms again&s;t him. After that, by <HI>Tamerlan:</HI> and after him by &s;everal other both <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> and <HI>Tartarian</HI> Princes. The Predece&s;&s;ors of <HI>I&s;hmael Sophi</HI> kept their Court there for &s;ome time; and it is &s;aid that &s;ome Ages be|fore, the la&s;t Kings of <HI>Armenia</HI> re&s;ided there; at which time it contain'd above four hundred Churches. And it is very
<PB N="377" REF="183">
true, that there are a great number in it which are ruin'd, but not one that is entire, nor doe there inhabit in it any Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>The 7th we travell'd &s;ix Leagues in a Country more lovely then that already de&s;crib'd, where we came to a Village at the end of every thou&s;and paces: and we could &s;ee at a di&s;tance an infinite number of others, &s;urrounded with Groves of Wil|lows and Poplers: and environ'd which delightful Meadows. We lay at <HI>Hibi&eacute;,</HI> a very fair and fair and large Village; and &s;eated near to a Town that is wall'd and well peopl'd, which is call'd <HI>San-cala:</HI> which word being abbreviated &s;igni|fies the <HI>Ca&s;tle of Ha&s;an.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>8th.</HI> Our Hor&s;es were &s;o tir'd that we could get no farther then <HI>Ebher,</HI> which is no more then two leagues from <HI>Hibi&eacute;;</HI> though we travell'd all the way over mo&s;t of tho&s;e de|lightful and plea&s;ant Plains already mention'd, directing our Cour&s;e &s;till to the South. Now that which makes tho&s;e places &s;o delightful is the great Number of Rivulets, with which they are water'd, and the good Husbandry of the Inha|bitants. For as I have already &s;aid, the &s;oyl of the <HI>Parthians</HI> is dry and barren of it &s;elf; neverthele&s;s wherever it can be water'd, it produces whatever the Manurer plea&s;es to have it, fair and good in its Kind.</P>
<P><HI>Ebher</HI> is but a &s;mall City, counting only the buildings; for it contains not above two thou&s;and five hundred Hou&s;es; but to tho&s;e Hou&s;es belong &s;o many Gardens, and tho&s;e &s;o large, that it is good riding for a Hor&s;e-man to cro&s;s it in half an hour. A &s;mall River, that bears the name of the City, runs through the middle of it, from one end to the other. It is &s;aid to be the &s;ame City which the Ancients call'd <HI>Baron|tha.</HI> The &s;ituation of it is jolly and delightful, the Air very whol&s;om, and the Soyl produces plenty of Fruit and other Provi&s;ions. The buildings are tolerably hand&s;om; and the Inns, the Taverns and other publick Structures very well, con&s;idering the Place. It contains three &s;pacious Mo&s;quees; and in the middle of the City are to be &s;een the Ruins of a Ca&s;tle built of Earth. It lies di&s;tant from the <HI>Equator</HI> 36 deg. 45. min. and from the fortunate I&s;lands, 48. deg. 30. min. Which Longitude, and all others that I ob&s;erve, are tak'n from the new <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Tables. It is govern'd by a <HI>Darogu&eacute;,</HI> or <HI>Mayor;</HI> and the <HI>Mirt&s;hecar-ba&s;hi,</HI> or <HI>Chief Hunt&s;man,</HI> has his A&s;&s;igna|tions of Money charg'd upon the Revenue of this City. Which a&s;&s;ignation is call'd <HI>Tahvil.</HI> Of the &s;ignification of which word we &s;hall &s;peak more at large in another Place.</P>
<P><PB N="378" REF="184">
The Per&s;ian Geographers a&s;&s;ert that <HI>Ebher</HI> was built by <HI>Kei-Co&s;rou</HI> the Son of <HI>Sia-bouch,</HI> that <HI>Darab-Keihoni,</HI> or <HI>Darius,</HI> began to build the Ca&s;tle, that <HI>Skender-roumy,</HI> that is <HI>Alexander the Great,</HI> fini&s;h'd it, and that the City has been ruin'd and &s;ack'd as of|ten as the re&s;t which are near it. However &s;he has &s;o well recover'd her &s;elf, that, at pre&s;ent, there is but little appear|ance of tho&s;e former havocks. The &s;ame Geographers ob|&s;erve, that it is one of the mo&s;t Ancient Cities of that Province; and perhaps it may be either <HI>Vologoo-certa,</HI> or <HI>Me&s;&s;abetha,</HI> or <HI>Ar|tacana,</HI> of which there is &s;o frequent mention made in the Ancient Stories of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Ebher</HI> they begin to &s;peak <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> both in the Cities and Country: whereas all the way before the Vulgar Language is Turki&s;h, not altogether as they &s;peak it in Turkey, but with &s;ome little difference. From <HI>Ebher</HI> to the Indies they &s;peak <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> more or le&s;s neat, as the people are more or le&s;s at a di|&s;tance from <HI>Shiras,</HI> where the purity of the Per&s;ian Language is &s;poken: So that at <HI>Ebher,</HI> and in the parts thereabouts, 'tis but a rude and clowni&s;h &s;ort of Dialect which the people make u&s;e of.</P>
<P>The <HI>9th</HI> we travell'd nine Leagues over Plains delightful ev'n unto Admiration: and indeed more lovely Vales are no where to be &s;een. After we had rode three Leagues, we pa&s;s'd through a large Town, almo&s;t as big as <HI>Ebher,</HI> call'd <HI>Par&s;ac;</HI> and a little farther we left <HI>Ca&s;bin</HI> upon the left hand, five Leagues di&s;tant from us: of which I made the follow|ing de&s;cription in the year 1674. during a re&s;idence of four Months that I &s;tay'd at Court.</P>
<P><HI>Ca&s;bin</HI> is a great City &s;eated in a delightful Plain, three Leagues from Mount <HI>Alou-vent:</HI> which is one of the highe&s;t and mo&s;t famous Mountains in all <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and a Branch of Mount <HI>Taurus,</HI> that cro&s;&s;es the Northern Parts of <HI>Parthia,</HI> as has bin already &s;aid, and &s;eparates it from <HI>Hyrcania.</HI> The length of this City is from North to South. In former times it was &s;urrounded with Walls, of which the Ruins are &s;till to be &s;een, but at pre&s;ent it lies open on every &s;ide. It is 6 miles in cir|cumference, containing twelve thou&s;and Hou&s;es, and a hundred thou&s;and Inhabitants; among which there are forty families of Chri&s;tians, and a hunder'd of Jews, all very poor. One of the faire&s;t places that is to be &s;een in this City, is the <HI>Hippo|drome,</HI> which they call <HI>Maydan-&s;ha,</HI> or the Royal <HI>Piazza,</HI> 700 paces in length, and 250 in breadth, and made after the Mo|del of <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI> To the Royal Palace belong &s;even Gates, of
<PB N="379" REF="184">
which the chief is call'd <HI>Ali-capi,</HI> or the High-Gate; on which there is an In&s;cription in Letters of Gold, to this effect. <HI>May this Gate always be open to good Fortune: by that confe&s;&s;ion which we make, that there is no God but God.</HI> The Gardens belonging to the Palace are very beautiful, kept in good order, and plant|ed Checquer-wi&s;e. King <HI>Tahmas,</HI> built this Palace, at fir&s;t a &s;mall thing, according to a draught given him by a <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Architect. <HI>Abas</HI> the Great quite alter'd and enlarg'd it. There are but few Mo&s;ques at <HI>Ca&s;bin;</HI> The chiefe&s;t of which by them call'd <HI>Met&s;hid-guima,</HI> or the Mo&s;que of the Congregation, was founded by <HI>Haron-Re&s;hid, Califf</HI> of <HI>Bagdat,</HI> in the year of the <HI>Hegyra</HI> 170. The Royal Mo&s;que call'd <HI>Met&s;hid-&s;ha</HI> is one of the large&s;t and faire&s;t in all <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> being &s;eated at the end of a &s;pacious Street, planted with fair Trees, which begins from one of the Gates of the Palace Royal. This Mo&s;que was almo&s;t all built at the expences of <HI>Tahmas,</HI> and in his Life time: his Father <HI>I&s;hmael</HI> having laid the Foundations, but dying before they came to be even with the &s;treet. There are al&s;o &s;everal hand&s;ome buildings among the <HI>Caravan&s;erai's</HI> or Publick Inns. That which they call the Royal Inn, con|tains 250 Channels, has a large Fountaine planted with Trees, in the middle of the Court, and two Gates, which the lead in the Court from two &s;treets full of &s;hops where the mo&s;t co&s;tly &s;ort of Merchandi&s;es are &s;old. But chiefe&s;t Grace, and Ornament of <HI>Ca&s;bin</HI> con&s;i&s;ts neither in Inns, nor Baths, nor in <HI>Bazars,</HI> nor in Markets, Tobacco, Coffee, or &s;trong-water Hou&s;es, where the Per&s;ians debauch them|&s;elves; but in the great number of Palaces of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Gran|dees, which they keep in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion from Father to Son, by rea&s;on of the long re&s;idence of the Court at <HI>Ca&s;bin</HI> from time to time. But there are not &s;o many Gardens in <HI>Ca&s;bin,</HI> as in mo&s;t part of the other City of that Province, becau&s;e the &s;oyl is Sandy and dry for want of water, there being only a little River which is no more then an Arm of the River <HI>Charoud,</HI> not &s;uffici|ent to to &s;upply the Grounds about it. So that they are forc'd to bring their water from the Mountain in Subterraneal Channels, which they call <HI>Keri&s;es,</HI> that empty them&s;elves into Vaults thirty foot deep; which though it be cool, is neverthele&s;s heavy and in&s;ipid. Which want of water is al&s;o the rea&s;on that the Air of <HI>Ca&s;bin</HI> is heavy, thick and not very healthful, e&s;pecially in Summer; by rea&s;on that the City not having a running &s;tream, has neither any &s;inks to carry away the filth of the Town. Yet notwith&s;tanding this &s;ame &s;carcity of
<PB N="380" REF="185">
water, the City abounds in Meat and all manner of Provi&s;ions, for that the Plains that lie round about it are &s;o well water'd, that they feed a world of Cattel, and produce a prodigious plenty of Corn and Fruits. Among the re&s;t the faire&s;t Grape in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> which they call <HI>Shahoni,</HI> or the Royal Grape, being of a Gold Colour, tran&s;parent and as big as a &s;mall Olive. The&s;e Grapes are dry'd and tran&s;ported all over the King|dom. They al&s;o make the &s;tronge&s;t Wine in the World, and the mo&s;t lu&s;cious, but very thick, as all &s;trong and &s;weet wines u&s;ually are. This incomparable Grape grows only upon the young Branches, which they never water. So that for five months together they grow in the Heat of Summer, and under a &s;corching Sun, without receiving a drop of water ei|ther from the skie or otherwi&s;e. When the Vintage is over, they let in their Cattel to browze in the Vineyards; afterwards they cut off all the great Wood, and leave only the young &s;tocks about three foot high, which need no propping up with Poles, as in other places, and therefore they never make u&s;e of any &s;uch &s;upporters. There is al&s;o great Plenty of Pi&s;tachio's in tho&s;e parts, where the Air is very hot in the Summer all the day long, by rea&s;on of the high Mountain that lies to the North. But on the other &s;ide the Nights are &s;o cold, that if a Man expo&s;e him&s;elf never &s;o little to the air, after he is undre&s;t, he is &s;ure to fall &s;ick. <HI>Ca&s;bin</HI> lies in 85. deg. and 5. min. of Long. and in 36. deg. and 35. min. of Latitude.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t part of our <HI>European</HI> Chorographers who have di&s;|cours'd of the Cities of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> affirm <HI>Ca&s;bin</HI> to be the ancient <HI>Ar|&s;acia,</HI> and that before it was call'd <HI>Europa</HI> till the <HI>Parthians</HI> gave it that name from <HI>Ar&s;aces,</HI> the fir&s;t of their Emperors; that is it the &s;ame with that City, which the Greeks call'd <HI>Ragea,</HI> and the ho|ly Scripture <HI>Rages</HI> of <HI>Media.</HI> Some are of opinion, that it was that &s;ame <HI>Ca&s;bira</HI> of which <HI>Strabo</HI> makes mention, but the Per&s;ian Hi&s;tories will not allow it to be &s;o ancient. The Hi&s;tory entitl'd <HI>Elbeijon,</HI> or the <HI>Explication,</HI> relates, That this was founded by <HI>Shapour</HI> the Son of <HI>Arde&s;hir-babecon,</HI> and that he gave it the name of <HI>Shaepour,</HI> as much as to &s;ay, the <HI>City of the Kings Son.</HI> For <HI>Shae,</HI> &s;ignifies a <HI>King;</HI> and <HI>Pour</HI> in the ancient <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> a <HI>Son.</HI> Whence the name of <HI>Sha-pour,</HI> which the ancient Greeks call <HI>Sapores.</HI> The Hi&s;tory entitl'd <HI>Teduine,</HI> affirms, that the City which was call'd <HI>Shaepour</HI> was not <HI>Ca&s;bin,</HI> and that it was not built on the &s;ame place where <HI>Ca&s;bin</HI> now &s;tands; but at lea&s;t three Leagues above, toward the We&s;t, at the Concour&s;e
<PB N="381" REF="185">
of two Rivers, the one named <HI>Haroud,</HI> already mention'd, which &s;prings from the Mountain <HI>Alou-vent,</HI> and the other call'd <HI>Ebher-roud,</HI> or the River of <HI>Ebher.</HI></P>
<P>I have heard &s;everal Per&s;ons of Quality affirm, that there are in that place va&s;t heaps of Ruins to be &s;een; and all Au|thors agree that the two Towns, call'd <HI>Sart&s;h&eacute;,</HI> not far from thence, were built in the Reign of <HI>Arde&s;hir-babecon.</HI> Another Per&s;ian Hi&s;tory, compos'd by an Author call'd by the name of <HI>Ambdalla,</HI> relates that <HI>Casbin</HI> had its fir&s;t Ri&s;e from a Ca&s;tle which the King la&s;t mention'd caus'd to be built, to &s;top the Inroads of the <HI>Deilemites,</HI> that came down from Mount <HI>Alouvent,</HI> and ravag'd all the Territory. That this Ca&s;tle was &s;eated in the middle of the City, where is now the Royal <HI>Pi|azza</HI> of <HI>Ca&s;bin,</HI> and that it was ruin'd by the <HI>Arabians</HI> in the time of <HI>O&s;man,</HI> one of <HI>Mahomets</HI> fir&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. And indeed al|mo&s;t all their Hi&s;tories make mention of this Ca&s;tle, and &s;ay, that after it was demoli&s;h'd it was rebuilt again much larger then before, and a great Town rais'd round about it. <HI>Mou|&s;ael-hadibilla,</HI> the Son of <HI>Mahomet-mehdy,</HI> Califf of <HI>Bagdat,</HI> caus'd it to be &s;urrounded with walls in the 170. year of the <HI>Hegyra,</HI> and about a thou&s;and paces from it built a little City, which he call'd by his own name <HI>Medina-Mou&s;&s;i,</HI> which name one large Ward or Quarter of <HI>Ca&s;bin</HI> carrys to this day. <HI>Moubarec-&s;uzbee</HI> one of the <HI>Califfs</HI> free'd Servants, who had the Government of the Province, and to whom the work was recommended, built another City, at an equal di&s;tance, and call'd it <HI>Moubareki&eacute;,</HI> for the pre&s;ervation of his name, which the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> &s;ome time after call'd <HI>Moubarec-abad. Moubarec</HI> &s;ignifying ble&s;&s;ed, <HI>abada habitation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Haron-Re&s;hid</HI> Brother and Succe&s;&s;or to <HI>Mou&s;a-elhadi,</HI> joyn'd the&s;e three little Cities into one, by filling up the void &s;pace with a great number of buildings; and then order'd the whole to be encompa&s;s'd with Walls and Fortifications. Which work was begun in the 190 year of the <HI>Hegyra. Haron</HI> al&s;o had a de&s;ign to have made it a Bull-wark again&s;t the Incur&s;ions of the <HI>Hircanians</HI> and <HI>Deilamites,</HI> and a <HI>Magazine</HI> for the warr which he was intending again&s;t <HI>Iberia,</HI> and withal a place of Trade: but dying not long after, the work remain'd imper|fect. In the year 245, in the Reign of <HI>Muktadis-billa-Mou&s;i, Nufa's</HI> &s;on, who had &s;haken off the Yoak of that <HI>Pontiff,</HI> and u&s;urp'd the Royal Authority in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> fini&s;h'd the Walls and Fortifications, and gave to the City, the name of <HI>Ca&s;bin,</HI> or <HI>Ca&s;vin,</HI> for the word is &s;ometimes pronounc'd with a <HI>b,</HI> and &s;ometimes with a <HI>v,</HI> from a word that &s;ignifies Puni&s;hment
<PB N="382" REF="186">
or pain, becau&s;e he impri&s;on'd in that Ga&s;tle all his <HI>Grandees</HI> which he de&s;ign'd to puni&s;h. There is al&s;o another rea&s;on giv'n for the Denomination, that is to &s;ay, becau&s;e this City was once a place of Exilement. Tho <HI>Acemberg,</HI> an <HI>Armenian</HI> Author, is of a different opinion; for he believes that the Ci|ty of <HI>Ca&s;bin</HI> was &s;o call'd by King <HI>Ca&s;bin,</HI> after his own name.</P>
<P>In the year 364. a part of the Wall being fall'n down, <HI>Sa|heb Califf I&s;hmael,</HI> chief mini&s;ter of &s;tate to <HI>Ali&eacute;-fecre-deulet,</HI> King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> caus'd the Ruins to be repair'd, and being al|mo&s;t utterly de&s;troy'd in the Civil Wars, <HI>Emir &s;herif-abouali Ja|fer,</HI> took care of its Re&s;tauration, and in the year, 411. caus'd the work to be follow'd &s;o clo&s;e, that within two Years, there was no &s;igne of any Ruins. The Hi&s;tory of <HI>Ca&s;bin</HI> makes mention of two other fatal di&s;a&s;ters that be|fell it, occa&s;ion'd by Earth-quakes. The fir&s;t in the year 460. that overturn'd all the walls and a third part of the Build|ings: And the &s;econd which did not &s;o much mi&s;chief as the fir&s;t, in the year 562. at what time <HI>Mahomet,</HI> the Son of <HI>Abdalla-elmegare,</HI> who reign'd in the Country of the <HI>Parthians,</HI> remov'd his Court near <HI>Ca&s;bin,</HI> to view the Ruins, and take care of the Reparations. And becau&s;e that the walls which were then only of Earth did not &s;eem &s;ufficiently beautiful nor &s;trong enough for &s;o great a City, he caus'd that which the Earth-quake had left &s;tanding, to be pull'd down, and rais'd up other Walls of red Brick. The Walls were a hundred thou&s;and and three hun|dred paces in compa&s;s, and at the end of every five hundred paces fortifi'd with Towers. The <HI>Tartars</HI> and <HI>Turks</HI> utterly ruin'd the&s;e Towers and Walls at &s;everal Times, and tho&s;e that were rebuilt in their Room, after the de&s;tructions of eve|ry new inva&s;ion. The Ruins of which are &s;till to be &s;een, as I have &s;aid already.</P>
<P>After all <HI>Ca&s;bin</HI> was re&s;tor'd and rebuilt as you &s;ee, it has en|joy'd forabove the&s;e three hundred years both peace and plenty, by the Advantage of its &s;ituation, which renders it &s;o convenient for the Trade of <HI>Iberia, Hyrcania,</HI> and <HI>Media,</HI> with the Southern Provinces of the Kingdom. In the 955. year of the <HI>Hegyra,</HI> King <HI>Tahmas,</HI> de&s;pairing to defend <HI>Tauris</HI> again&s;t <HI>Solyman,</HI> retir'd to <HI>Casbin,</HI> and made that City the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of his Kingdom: finding it convenient for all Sea&s;ons in the Year. There he &s;pent the Winter; in the Summer he retir'd three or four Leagues into the Country, and liv'd in Tents, at the foot of Mount <HI>Alouvent,</HI> in a place abounding with cool Springs
<PB N="383" REF="186">
and plea&s;ant Shades. His Succe&s;&s;ors liv'd after the &s;ame Rate, till <HI>Abas</HI> the Great, who the fir&s;t year of his Reign remov'd his Court to <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI> And there are &s;everal Rea&s;ons alledg'd for this Change. Some attributed it to the Air of <HI>Casbin,</HI> which the King did not find &s;o healthful: Others affirm that he was frighted by the <HI>A&s;trologers,</HI> who told him, that the Stars threat'ned him with &s;everal Misfortunes if he &s;taid at <HI>Casbin.</HI> But others a&s;&s;ert, it was only the better to accom|pli&s;h the de&s;ign of building a new City, as being over per|&s;waded, that it was the &s;urer way to Eternize his Memory then all his great Actions. But the mo&s;t probable Rea&s;on was one which I heard from a great Lord, who was high|ly e&s;teem'd by that Potent Prince, That when he had laid the de&s;ign of tho&s;e Conque&s;ts which he made with &s;o much Renown, as well to the Ea&s;t as to the South, he for&s;ook <HI>Cas|bin</HI> and remov'd to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> that he might be nearer the Coun|try which he intended to Conquer.</P>
<P>However it were, the City is much decay'd, &s;ince the Re|moval of the Royal Re&s;idence, and that it has lo&s;t all tho&s;e Perqui&s;ites that &s;et forth the Pomp and Grandeur o&s; a &s;ump|tuous Court. The Succe&s;&s;ors of <HI>Abas</HI> have re&s;ided there for one or two years together, and the deceas'd King was upon his way thither when he dy'd. For the City had earne&s;tly im|portun'd him by Pre&s;ents and Reque&s;ts, and were &s;o over|joy'd to under&s;tand his Maje&s;ty was coming, that they pre&s;en|ted the Me&s;&s;enger that brought the news with a Pre&s;ent of three hundred <HI>Tomans,</HI> which amounts to about one thou&s;and Guines.</P>
<P>Now the chief advantage which accrews to the City from the Court's re&s;iding there, is the con&s;umption of a va&s;t quan|tity of Provi&s;ion which the Country produces, and which they cannot export, in regard the Countries round about have no need of &s;upplies.</P>
<P>Now be&s;ides all that has been &s;aid, that renders <HI>Casbin</HI> a famous City, we mu&s;t not forget rhat it has been a place ce|lebrated for the Birth of &s;everal great men: among the re&s;t <HI>Locman,</HI> highly e&s;teem'd for the Fables which he &s;o well com|pos'd in imitation of <HI>E&s;op,</HI> that &s;ome learned Men uphold it to be the &s;ame Book.</P>
<P>The City is govern'd by a <HI>Darogu&eacute;,</HI> or <HI>Mayor,</HI> who is cho|&s;en every Year, and in that Year makes his office worth him &s;ix hundred <HI>Tomans;</HI> or two thou&s;and pounds. In their Judicial Acts and Records, they give to this City the additi|onal
<PB N="384" REF="187">
name of <HI>Daral-Seltenet,</HI> or <HI>the Seat of Royalty;</HI> becau&s;e the Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> who reign'd in the 15. and 16. Ages there kept their Court as has been &s;aid.</P>
<P>We ended our days Journey at <HI>Kiar&eacute;,</HI> a large Village con|&s;i&s;ting of five hundred Hou&s;es; in the mid&s;t of which upon a ri&s;ing Ground &s;tands a Ca&s;tle of Earth half ruin'd. The Remainder of &s;everal &s;trong Places in this Country demo|li&s;h'd in the 13. Age: Before which time Inva&s;ions were &s;o frequent, and &s;o &s;udden, and the Civill Warrs &s;o tedious and &s;o furiou&s;ly carry'd on, that they were forc'd to fortify them|&s;elves every where, and defend them&s;elves from all &s;orts of Per&s;ons: for &s;uch like Ca&s;tles are to be &s;een in all the Vil|lages, and great Towns, that are under the Juri&s;diction of <HI>Ca&s;bin.</HI></P>
<P>The 10. we travell'd four Leagues in a plain and plea|&s;ant Country, as in the preceding days; &s;till directing Cour&s;e to the South. And our manner of travelling all the way, par|ticularly from <HI>Mian&eacute;,</HI> which is upon the Confines in the Even|ing an hour or two before Sun &s;et, rode a Journey, of five or &s;ix Leagues by Midnight, or thereabours. Longer Journeys of eight or nine Leagues held us almo&s;t all night long which is the general way of travelling over all the Ea&s;t in Summertime, to avoi'd the heat of the Sun, which would melt both Man and Bea&s;t in the day time. In the night we travell'd a greater pace and more at ea&s;e: the Servants walk a foot with le&s;s trouble; and the Ma&s;ters them&s;elves are glad to walk &s;ometimes, when they find them&s;elves &s;leepy, and to &s;hake off tho&s;e little &s;hiverings caus'd by the Coolne&s;s of the Air; be&s;ides that it is a great ea&s;e to the Hor&s;es. When you get to your Inn, you go to Bed, and fetch up that &s;leep in the day, which you lo&s;t in the night. Another advantage of tra|velling by night is this, that the Bea&s;ts of Carriage, re&s;t all the time that the Heat and the Flies mole&s;t 'em, and are bet|ter lookt after, while the Servants dre&s;s 'em by day-light; be&s;ides that in the day time Provi&s;ions both for Hor&s;e and Man are more ready to be had. And then again the Ho&s;ts of the <HI>Caravan&s;eray,</HI> having &s;lept almo&s;t all the day for want of Employment, are then up and ready at all Commands.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing which the Grooms do, at the fir&s;t coming into the Inn, is to walk the Hor&s;es, then they cloath them and loo&s;en their Girts. About an hour or two after, they give 'em to eat, and then the Grooms go to &s;leep: about nine or ten a Clock every body ri&s;es, and eats a light Breakfa&s;t;
<PB N="385" REF="187">
after that the Grooms dre&s;s their Hor&s;es, and the Cooks get ready their Victuals. In the mean time the Ma&s;ter betakes him&s;elf again to his Re&s;t, or el&s;e otherwi&s;e employs him&s;elf. About four a Clock they meat their Hor&s;es with Barley (for they never give 'em Oats in the Ea&s;t) and then put on the Sad|dle: at which time Supper is &s;erv'd in. While the Ma&s;ter Sups, the Cook clean&s;es the Kitchin Furniture, and the <HI>Valet de Chambre</HI> puts up the <HI>Ma&s;ra's,</HI> which is a kind of Portmantle where the Bed and Bed-cloaths are put up, with as much Con|venience as in a Che&s;t, of which one Hor&s;e will carry two. Then the Servants go to Supper, while the Ma&s;ter gets him|&s;elf ready and puts on his Boots. When the Servants have &s;upp'd, which is &s;oon done among the A&s;iatics: the Cook puts up his Uten&s;ils, and the Groom bridles and girts up the Hor|&s;es, and the re&s;t fold up the Carpets, or do what el&s;e belong to their Duties: la&s;tly, they load and &s;o depart. They that have not &s;een the Fa&s;hions of the Ea&s;t, will hardly believe with what Conveniency Men travel in tho&s;e Parts. Howe|ver it is very great, though a man may be &s;aid to carry a whole Hou&s;e a long with him: and the rea&s;on is, becau&s;e e|very Servant knowing what he has to do, every thing is di&s;|patch'd in an In&s;tant.</P>
<P>We lodg'd at <HI>Segs-abad,</HI> which &s;ignifies the Habitation of Dogs; being a Town as large as <HI>Kiare;</HI> &s;eated in a fair Plain, where there are a great number of Villages. There are no Inns at either of tho&s;e two places, but in each fifteen or twenty great Hou&s;es, which the Owners keep open for the Entertainment of Travellers, and which are kept much more cleanly than the <HI>Caravan&s;erais.</HI> There is al&s;o much better Accommodati|on, but at a dearer rate: For the Ho&s;t not daring to demand either for his Lodging or his Trouble, which is not the Cu|&s;tom, he pays him&s;elf by the Provender and Provi&s;ions which he &s;ells his Gue&s;ts at his own price, whereas in the <HI>Caravan&s;erais</HI> every thing is tax'd.</P>
<P>The 11. we travell'd eight Leagues: the fir&s;t two over Mole-hills and little hills, where the way was &s;omwhat rugged; the re&s;t over a fair champaign Ground full of Villages, and for the mo&s;t part well manur'd. It is &s;aid to be the place where the Battel was fought between <HI>Lucullus</HI> and <HI>Mithridates,</HI> and which the defeat of <HI>Cra&s;&s;us</HI> render'd yet more famous in the Roman Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>We alighted at an Inn call'd <HI>Koskeirou,</HI> one of the faire&s;t and large&s;t that ever was built in <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> There are belong|ing
<PB N="386" REF="188">
to it two Gardens, two Ci&s;terns, a Bath, and a &s;mall Canal: being altogether the Gifts of the Chief Wife of <HI>Abas</HI> the Great. She founded this place, and &s;ettled a Revenue of Four&s;core Pounds to pay four Servants that were to lodge in the Inn, meerly to keep it clean, and to wait upon Travellers. But the four&s;core Pounds have bin &s;ince converted to other u&s;es, through the Covetou&s;ne&s;s of the Tru&s;tees. Which is the rea&s;on that the <HI>Caravan&s;erai</HI> lies very na&s;ty every where, and runs to ruin for want of good keeping. It co&s;t four Thou&s;and <HI>Tomans</HI> the Building, which comes to eighteen thou&s;and Pounds. There are al&s;o in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> other Inns, be&s;ides Bridges, Cau&s;eys, and Ho&s;pitals, remaining Monuments of the Charity of that Prince&s;s; which have render'd her Name famous, and if we may believe public Report, &s;he expended in Pious Works, no le&s;s than a hundred thou&s;and <HI>Tomans,</HI> which make about four hundred thou&s;and Pounds Sterling.</P>
<P>The 12. we travell'd eight Leagues, three over the plea|&s;ant Plains where &s;tands <HI>Koskeirou;</HI> and five in a deep Coun|try, where the Road is &s;omewhat crooked and rough. Two hours before day we arriv'd at <HI>Sava,</HI> and lodg'd in the Sub|urbs that lie upon the high Road.</P>
<P><HI>Sava</HI> is a great City &s;eated in a &s;andy and barren Plain, within &s;ight of Mount <HI>Alouvent.</HI> It is two miles in Circuit, and girt with walls, but thinly peopl'd: for unle&s;s it be the Heart of the City, the re&s;t runs to ruin for want of Inhabi|tants. The Walls are al&s;o in a bad condition, nor is there any thing remarkable round about it; tho formerly it has been a fair City, as the ruins of &s;everal great Structures de|mon&s;trate. There runs a &s;mall River through, and a good number of Canals. The Soyl is dry and &s;andy; producing nothing without Art and Indu&s;try; yet it is beautify'd with a great number of Gardens.

<P>The Hi&s;tories of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> unanimou&s;ly con&s;ent, that the whole Plain of <HI>Sava,</HI> was formerly a Salt Mar&s;h or Lake, like to that Lake which is call'd the <HI>Salt-Sea,</HI> not above twenty Leagues from this City to the Ea&s;t, and which is cro&s;s'd over a Cru&s;ey thirty Eeagues in length, as ye travel from <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> into <HI>Hyrcania;</HI> but tho&s;e Hi&s;tories do not agree upon the time that this Mar&s;h was dry'd up.

by a Miracle. And the &s;ame Hi&s;tories report, that he wrought that Miracle, onely by the pronuntiation of one word; and that he did it in favour to the Inhabitants of <HI>Com,</HI> who took his part again&s;t the Father-in-Law of <HI>Mahomet.</HI> They al&s;o add, that tho&s;e People, to pre&s;erve the Memory of &s;o great an Accident, built a City in the mid&s;t of that &s;ame drain'd Fenn, and laid the fir&s;t Stone upon the Sun's entring into <HI>Ge|mini.</HI> The northern People ruin'd it in the fourth Age of <HI>Mahumeti&s;m.</HI> But <HI>Coja-Sehid-el-din</HI> the Son of <HI>Melec-Sheref-el-din-Savegi</HI> rebuilt it forty years after that, much more &s;tately than it was before its De&s;truction, wall'd it, and pav'd it with red Bricks. Sometime after that <HI>Coja-S&eacute;hid-el-din</HI> enlarg'd it to the North, and brought the water to it through ten Chan|nels, and built a &s;pacious Mo&s;que in the Ea&s;tern part of it, upon the &s;ame Foundation where <HI>Suyed-E&s;hac,</HI> the Son of <HI>I|mam-Mou&s;a-Cazem</HI> had built one &s;everal Ages before.

The Per&s;ian Hi&s;tories re|port, that in the Time of <HI>Calife Medybilla-abou-Mahamed-Dar|vanich,</HI> who liv'd in the ninth Age of Chri&s;tiani&s;m, the City of <HI>Rey</HI> was divided into 96 Quarters, of which every one con|tain'd 46 Streets, and every Street 400 Hou&s;es and ten <HI>Mo&s;ques.</HI> That there were moreover in the City 6400 Colleges, 16600 Baths, 15000 Towers of Mo&s;ques; 12000 Mills, 1700 Chan|nels, and 13000 Inns. I dare not in&s;ert the number of Hou&s;es, becau&s;e I cannot believe there were half &s;o many people: Ne|verthele&s;s our Geography is in that particular a&s;&s;erted, and ju&s;tifi'd by all the Oriental Authors. The Arabian Writers affirm in like manner, that in the third Age of Mahu|meti&s;m, which is exactly at the &s;ame time, that <HI>Rey</HI> was

the be&s;t peopl'd City in <HI>A&s;ia;</HI> and next to <HI>Babylon</HI> there never was any City &s;o con&s;iderable, either for the Number, Wealth, or Trade of her Inhabitants. And hence it was, that tho&s;e pompous Titles were given her in Hi&s;tories, <HI>The first of Cities, the Spou&s;e of the World, the Gate of the Gates of the Earth,</HI> and <HI>the Market of the Univer&s;e.</HI> Nor is the Original of <HI>Rey</HI> le&s;s remarkable.

The la&s;t de&s;truction that befel it happen'd in the Time of the Civil Wars, at what time the Tartars extended their Incur&s;i|ons into the Country of the Parthians. The Religion of the Mahumetans was then divided into Sects, as at this day: &s;o that the Sect of <HI>Shia,</HI> which was that which the Per&s;ians &s;tuck to, and that of the <HI>Sunnis</HI> which the Turks follow'd, divided the whole Country. The&s;e two Factions were at War for &s;ixty years together, and the Sect of <HI>Shia</HI> being born down, by the the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the petty Tartars, who are <HI>Sunnis,</HI> the victo|rious Sect &s;ub-divided them&s;elves into two other Opinions, which they call from the Name of their fir&s;t Broachers, <HI>Shafai</HI> and <HI>Hanifei,</HI> which flouri&s;h to this day among the Mahumetan <HI>Sunnis.</HI> The&s;e Wars, together with the Incur&s;ions of the Tar|tars, de&s;troy'd the Potent <HI>Rey,</HI> and reduc'd it to nothing be|fore the end of the &s;ixth Age of the Mahumetan <HI>Epoche.</HI> Three&s;core years after that <HI>Facre-Eddin</HI> Prince of <HI>Parthia,</HI> ha|ving made a Peace with <HI>Gazen-Can</HI> King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> of the Race of the Tartars, endeavour'd to rebuild this unfortunate City, but could: not accompli&s;h his De&s;ign. <HI>Ptolomy</HI> calls this City <HI>Raquaja,</HI> and the re&s;t of the greek Authors call it by &s;uch Names, as &s;eem to be form'd from the word <HI>Rey.</HI> It lies in 35. deg. and 35. min. of Latitude, and 76. deg. 20. min. of Longitude.

<P>This City has produc'd a great many Learned Men, and hoarded within its own bo&s;om for &s;everal Ages, the chiefe&s;t part of the Riches of the Ea&s;t. It is reported that during its Splendor, the &s;maller Mo&s;ques had no le&s;s then a hundred Branches of all &s;orts of Metal, furni&s;h'd with burning Tapers, and the larger Mo&s;ques five hundred, that were kept lighted all night long.</P>
<P>The 13. we travell'd &s;ix Leagues through a plain and le|vel Country: but the Road was full of turnings and wind|dings, by rea&s;on of the turning and winding of the River, and the &s;everal Canals in &s;everal parts of the Plain that water the Grounds. We pa&s;s'd over one large Bridge, and &s;everal &s;mall ones, and lodg'd at a great Inn built upon a flat piece of Ground, near to four others which are not &s;o big. It is call'd <HI>Jafer-abad;</HI> or the Habitation of <HI>Jafer,</HI> from the name of a great Per&s;ian Lord, who caus'd the fir&s;t Inns to be built that ever were built in this place.</P>
<P>The 14. we travell'd five Leagues over the &s;ame Plain. When we came about half way, we rode along by the &s;ide of a little Hill call'd <HI>Couh-Teli&s;me; Couh</HI> &s;ignifying a Mountain, and <HI>Teli&s;me</HI> that which we call <HI>Tali&s;man,</HI> or Hyeroglyphic. This Mountain has one thing remarkably peculiar to it, which I never could believe till now; Which is this, That &s;till as you approach nearer and nearer to it, it &s;hews a different form, and varies both in its bigne&s;s and figure. The Top or Point of it is always in &s;ight, and you would think, that it turn'd that &s;ide which way &s;oever you &s;tood to look upon it: which I have experienc'd to be true, as having beheld this Mountain from all the points of the Compa&s;s. Which natural Inchant|ment may proceed in my Opinion, from the variety of the Op|tick <HI>Mediums</HI> through which that little Mountain is beheld, Nature having there &s;ported &s;omething that re&s;embles tho&s;e Ingenuous Pictures, that vary the Object by turning the Po|&s;ture
<PB N="390" REF="190">
of the Picture this or that way to the Eye. It con&s;i&s;ts of a black Earth, that crumbles like the burnt Mould at the foot of Mountains that vomit fire: and it is full of Caves and blind Corners, that &s;eem to have been made of purpo&s;e. This made me enquire of the People of the Country, whether that Moun|tain was wont to ca&s;t forth fire; but I could, meet with no body that ever &s;aw or heard of any &s;uch thing. But this is a publick Caution to all men: For they tell ye, that they who de&s;ire to a&s;cend that Mountain never come back; and it is reported that <HI>Abas</HI> the Great one day &s;ent a Foot-Boy up with a Cre&s;&s;et Light upon his Shoulders, but that the Light pre&s;ently went out and the Fellow never appear'd more. This Mountain lies upon the left hand as you go to <HI>Com.</HI></P>
<P>To which City as we drew near, we &s;aw on every &s;ide the little <HI>Mau&s;oleums</HI> and Mo&s;ques, where the Grand-Children and De&s;cendants of <HI>Aly</HI> lie interr'd. The Per&s;ians call the fir&s;t De&s;cendants from this <HI>Califfe, Yman Zade,</HI> or Sons of the <HI>A|po&s;tles;</HI> and the&s;e are the Per&s;ian Saints, of which there are an infinite number buried in this Kingdom; for they reckon four hundred Sepulchers about <HI>Com.</HI> We made this City the end of our Journey at ten a Clock at night: and I was afraid I &s;hould have ended my Life there too by an Accident altoge|ther unexpected. For I alighted at the Door of the <HI>Caravan|&s;eray,</HI> and held my Hor&s;e by the Bridle, expecting my Groom to come and take him, and what time another led Hor&s;e perceiving me at his Tail, up with his hind Legs, and with all his force yerk'd with his Heels at my Brea&s;t; &s;o that had I been never &s;o little farther from him, he had broken my Bones. I confe&s;s I did not fall; for I was &s;upported by my Hor&s;es head, but for a quarter of an hour I was almo&s;t &s;tifl'd, not being able to fetch my Breath. God in his Mercy took Compar&s;ion of me, &s;o that I e&s;cap'd the fury of the Blow; tho I felt it &s;ix weeks afterwards; yet not &s;o, but that I could go about my Bu&s;ine&s;s as I was wont.</P>
<P><HI>Com</HI> is a large City &s;eated in a Plain by a River &s;ide, half a League from a very high Mountain.

<HI>Georgia,</HI> who embrac'd the Mahometan Religion, to obtain the Government of that Kingdom: and in this Garden it is that the common people of <HI>Com</HI> mo&s;t u&s;ually take their Re|creation. There are al&s;o two fair Keys all along the River, the whole length of the City, and at the Ea&s;t end a fair Bridge. It contains al&s;o very large and beautiful <HI>Bazars,</HI> where the Markets are kept both for Whole-Sale and Retail. Neverthele&s;s <HI>Com</HI> is no place of great Trade: they export from thence va&s;t Quantities of Fruit dry'd and raw, e&s;pecially <HI>Pomegranates,</HI> great &s;tore of Sope, Sword Blades, and Earthen Ware both white and varni&s;h'd. And this is peculiar to the white Ware, which is thence tran&s;ported, that in the Summer it cools the water wonderfully and very &s;uddenly, by rea&s;on of continual Tran&s;piration. So that they who de&s;ire to drink cool and deliciou&s;ly, never drink in the &s;ame Pot above five or &s;ix days at mo&s;t. They wa&s;h it with Ro&s;e-Water the fir&s;t time,, to take away the ill &s;mell of the Earth; and they hang it in the Air full of water, wrapt up in a moi&s;t linnen Cloth. A fourth part of the water tran&s;pires in &s;ix hours the fir&s;t time, after that &s;till le&s;s from day to day, till at la&s;t the Pores are clos'd up, by the thick matter contein'd in the water, which &s;tops in the Pores. But &s;o &s;oon as the Pores are &s;topp'd, the water &s;tinks in the Pots, and you mu&s;t take new ones. There are in this City a va&s;t number of deep Cellars, out of which the People draw water to drink: to the greate&s;t part of which Cellars, you mu&s;t go down a de&s;|cent of forty or fifty Steps, that are very &s;teep to boot. But the water which they fetch from thence is as cool as any Ice; coming from Fountains that are &s;topt with Cocks: So that this Water is a mo&s;t delicious Refre&s;hment in the Sum|mer, which is furiou&s;ly hot at <HI>Com,</HI> and all the adjacent Parts. This City al&s;o contains a great number of fair Inns and <HI>Mo&s;ques,</HI> of which the faire&s;t is that wherein the two la&s;t de|ceas'd Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> lie enterr'd.</P>
<P>And here I &s;hall give you the Platform of that Celebrated <HI>Mo&s;que,</HI> &s;o much talk'd of over all the Ea&s;t. It has four Courts belonging to it, as you may perceive by the Draught. The fir&s;t is planted with Trees and Flowers like a Garden: being a long Square, having an Alley in the middle which is &s;eparated from the Beds and Plots by a Balu&s;trade. There are al&s;o two Terra&s;&s;es an each &s;ide, running the full length of the Garden, three foot high. Upon each &s;ide of which there are twenty Chambers vaulted, nine foot &s;quare,

It may be ea&s;ily conjectur'd that it was a &s;umptu|ous and co&s;tly Piece, as well by the Price that it co&s;t, as by the number of Camels which were requir'd to carry it, that were in all 280. The Anti-chamber was made of Velvet with a Ground of Gold. Of which the Corni&s;h was embelli&s;h'd with Ver&s;es that concluded in this manner, <HI>If thou demandest at what time the Throne of this Second</HI> Salomon <HI>was built,</HI> I will tell thee, Behold the Throne of the Second <HI>Salomon;</HI> where the Letters of the la&s;t words being tak'n for Ciphers make 1057.

<P>The &s;econd Court is not &s;o beautiful as the fir&s;t; but the third is nothing inferiour to it. It is &s;urrounded with Apart|ments, every one containing two Stories, a Terra&s;s, a <HI>Portico,</HI> and a Canal, in like manner as the former. Four large Trees &s;tand at each Corner, and cover it with their Boughs. Out of this third Court you enter into the fourth, by a Marble A&s;cent con&s;i&s;ting of twelve Steps. The Portal which is at the Top, is a mo&s;t magnificent Piece. It is cover'd below with white Marble, tran&s;parent like to Porphiry or Aggat. The top of it which is a large half <HI>Duomo</HI> is painted with <HI>More&s;co</HI> Work of Or and Azure laid on very thick. In this fourth Court are al&s;o Chambers both at the lower end, and on both &s;ides, with Terra&s;&s;es and <HI>Portico's,</HI> like the other three.

<P>Fronting the&s;e Courts &s;tands the Body of the Structure, con&s;i&s;ting of three great Chappels upon a Line. To the mid|dlemo&s;t belongs an Entrance eighteen Foot deep, every way magnificent, the Portal being of the &s;ame white Marble alrea|dy mention'd.

The Door which is twelve foot high, and &s;ix broad, is all of tran&s;parent Marble. The folding Doors are plated with Silver, embelli&s;h'd with Vermillion guilt, carv'd Work and poli&s;h'd, which make a Mo&s;aic altogether co&s;tly and full of Curio&s;ity. The Chappel is Octogonal, cover'd with a high <HI>Duomo;</HI> the lower part of which Chappel is cover'd
<PB N="394" REF="195">
with large Tiles of Porphiry wav'd, and painted with Flowers in Gold and Colours, &s;o lively and full of Lu&s;tre that they dazle the Eye. The upper part is of <HI>More&s;co</HI> Work, of lively and glittering Gold and Azure, and the Bottom of the <HI>Duomo</HI> is all of the &s;ame. This <HI>Duomo</HI> is very large and wonderfully beautiful, being overlaid without like the Portal. From the top of all ari&s;es a Spire, with a Cre&s;cent fixt at the top, the ends of which are rever&s;e, as you &s;ee in the Figure. This Pi|nacle, which is of a remarkable Bigne&s;s, is como&s;s'd of &s;e|veral Bowls of &s;everal Proportions, &s;et one upon another, and appears as you &s;tand below to be about twenty foot high with the Cre&s;cent, the whole of fine Gold. The Per&s;ians affirm it to be all Ma&s;&s;y: which if it be true, the Pinacle is worth Millions; but let it be what it will, 'tis a noble Ornament, of which the Value cannot but amount to a large Summ.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of that Chappel &s;tands the Tomb of <HI>Fatima,</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Mou&s;a Ca&s;em,</HI> one of the twelve <HI>Califfs,</HI> which the Per&s;ians believe to have been the lawful Succe&s;&s;ors of <HI>Ma|homet,</HI> after the Death of <HI>Ali</HI> his Son-in-Law. It contains eight feet in length, five in bredth, and &s;ix in height. Over-laid with Tiles of <HI>China,</HI> painted <HI>alamore&s;ca,</HI> and over-&s;pread with Cloth of Gold that hangs down to the ground on every &s;ide. It is enclos'd with a Grate of Ma&s;&s;y Silver, ten foot high, di|&s;tant half a foot from the Tomb; and at each Corner crown'd as it were with large Apples of fine Gold. Which is done to the end the People &s;hould not &s;ully the Tomb with their ki&s;|&s;ing and handling it: for the Tomb is lookt upon as a &s;acred Piece. Several breadths of Velvet hung about the in&s;ide of the Grate, hide it from the view of the People: &s;o that only Favor or Money can procure a &s;ight of it. The Flooer likewi&s;e is cover'd with a Carpet of very fine Woollen: over which at great Fe&s;tival Times, are &s;pread others of Silk and Gold. Over the Tomb, about ten foot in height, hang &s;everal Silver Ve&s;&s;els which they call <HI>Candil;</HI> being a &s;ort of Lamp, of which there are &s;ome that weigh &s;ixty Marks: and are otherwi&s;e fa|&s;hion'd then the Church Branches, as may be &s;een in the Fi|gures.

<P>Upon the Grate hang &s;everal In&s;criptions in Letters of Gold upon thick Velloms, as large as a large &s;heet of Paper. Which In&s;criptions contain the Elegies of the Saint and her Family. The In&s;cription upon the Front of the Entrance contains

the Prayer which they all generally &s;ay, that come in the Pilgrimage to the Sepulcher. The Pilgrim, when he enters, ki&s;&s;es the Thre&s;hold and the Grate three times; and &s;tanding upright with his Face towards the Tomb, one of the <HI>Molla's,</HI> that attend there day and night, comes to him, who cau&s;es him to &s;ay the Prayer word for word. After the Prayer &s;o &s;aid, the Pilgrim again ki&s;&s;es the Grate, and the foot of the Door; then giving the Prie&s;t four or five pence, more or le&s;s, according to his ability, he retires. If he de&s;ires a Cer|tificate of his Pilgrimage, they write him one in due form; the di&s;patch of which co&s;ts him half a Pi&s;tole, or eight or nine &s;hillings. All the money which the Pilgrims and other Vo|taries give, is put into a little iron Che&s;t, like the Trunk of a Tree, that &s;tands at the entrance into the Chappel, which is open'd every <HI>Friday,</HI> and what is found therein is di&s;tribu|ted among the people that belong to the <HI>Mo&s;que,</HI> and do Duty in that con&s;ecrated place.

<P>To conclude, this <HI>Fathma's</HI> Tomb was rebuilt three times.

They are of an equal Diameter, both the one and the other, at the end of a Gallery twelve foot broad and thirty five in length. At the entrance there is al&s;o a kind of Ve|&s;try, were the Ornaments and Moveables are kept. The Chap|pel, where <HI>Abas</HI> lies enterr'd, is an irregular Twelve-Angle: the other where <HI>Sephi</HI> is buried, is an irregular Square. The Ve&s;tries, Galleries and Chappels are hung with rich Tape|&s;tries: tho&s;e wherewith the Chappels are hung, are of Gold and Silk woven together. And indeed there can be &s;een no|thing more beautiful, nor more magnificent then the&s;e <HI>Mau|&s;oleums.</HI> The lower part is over-laid with large Tiles of Porphiry, painted with Gold and Azure: the Roofs are a mo&s;t ingenious and delicate Piece of Architecture, all pain|ted with rich <HI>More&s;co</HI> Work in lively Colours, that even da|zle the Eye. For the Gold and Azure is laid on &s;o thick, that you would &s;wear it was all Ma&s;&s;y in its Sub&s;tance. The <HI>Domo</HI> opens toward the lower part, with a double row of four and twenty Windows; and there is one very large one equal with the Ground, that looks into the Garden, with another oppo&s;ite to it, which looks into the great Chappel. The Gla&s;ing Work con&s;i&s;ts of Panes of Chry&s;tal, painted with Gold and Azure, and fa&s;ten'd in ma&s;&s;y Silver. But I remit the Reader to the Draughts, to take a more perfect view of the&s;e &s;umptuous Monuments, contenting my &s;elf to relate what they cannot expre&s;s. <HI>Abas</HI>'s is four foot high, four in breadth, and eight foot long.

Neverthele&s;s by degrees they repair'd one part of it again; but it did not begin to reflouri&s;h until this la&s;t Age, and &s;ince that <HI>Sephy</HI> was there interr'd. <HI>Abas</HI> the Second, his Son and Succe&s;&s;or, bani&s;h'd thither &s;uch Per&s;ons as were fallen from his Favour, to the end they might pray to God for his per&s;on, and give thanks to heaven for their Lives which he had &s;par'd 'em. <HI>Soliman</HI> at pre&s;ent reigning had made u&s;e of it, to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, &s;ending thither all tho&s;e whom he thought convenient to puni&s;h with Exile; and the great num|ber of exil'd per&s;ons of Quality it was, that has re&s;tor'd the City to that Splendor wherein now it &s;tands. In the Year 1634. an Inundation of Waters ruin'd a thou&s;and Hou&s;es: and it is but three Years &s;ince, that an Accident of the &s;ame nature had like to have ruin'd it all together. For two thou|&s;and Hou&s;es, and all the Ancient Hou&s;es were laid level with the Earth.

<P>The 17. we travell'd five Leagues cro&s;s the Plain. We found it all the way cover'd with a moving Sand, dry, with|out either Villages or Water. We lodg'd in a place call'd <HI>Ab&s;hirin,</HI> or <HI>Sweet Water,</HI> becau&s;e there is in that place a Foun|tain of fair Water and Ci&s;terns in the mid&s;t of &s;ix <HI>Carevan|&s;erais.</HI></P>
<P>The 18. our Journey reach'd to <HI>Ca&s;han,</HI> where we arriv'd, after we had travell'd &s;even Leagues, &s;teering toward the South, over the Plain already mention'd: and at the end of two Leagues, we found the Soyl delightful and fertile, &s;tor'd with large Villages. We pa&s;s'd through &s;everal, and about half the way left upon the left hand, at a near di&s;tance, a lit|tle City call'd <HI>Sarou,</HI> &s;eated at the foot of a Mountain.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Ca&s;han</HI> is &s;eated in a large Plain, near a high Mountain. It is a League in length, and a quarter of a League in breadth; extending it &s;elf in length from Ea&s;t to We&s;t. When you &s;ee it afar off, it re&s;embles a half Moon, the Cor|ners of which look toward both tho&s;e Parts of the Heavens. The Draught is no true Repre&s;entation, either of the Bigne&s;s or the Figure; as having been taken without a true Pro&s;pect. And the rea&s;on was the Indi&s;po&s;ition of my Painter, who be|ing extremely tir'd with the former days Travel, was not a|ble to &s;tir out of the Inn, where we lay. All that he could do was to get upon the Terra&s;s, and take the Draught from thence.</P>
<P>There is no River that runs by the City, only &s;everal Canals convey'd under Ground, with many deep Springs and Ci&s;terns as there are at <HI>Com.</HI> It is encompa&s;s'd with a double Wall, flank'd with round Towers, after the Ancient Fa&s;hion; to which there belong five Gates. One to the Ea&s;t, call'd the <HI>Royal Gate;</HI> as being near the Royal Palace, that &s;tands with|out the Walls. Another call'd the <HI>Gate of Fieu;</HI> becau&s;e it leads directly to a great Village, which bears that name. Another between the We&s;t and North, call'd the <HI>Gate of the Hou&s;e of Melic;</HI> as being near to a Garden of Plea&s;ure, which was plan|ted by a Lord of that Name. The two other Gates are op|po&s;ite to the South-Ea&s;t, and North-Ea&s;t. The one call'd <HI>Com Gate,</HI> and the other <HI>I&s;pahan Gate;</HI> be cau&s;e they lead to

tho&s;e Cities. The City and the Suburbs, which are more beauti|ful then the City, contain &s;ix thou&s;and five hundred Hou&s;es, as the People a&s;&s;ure us; forty Mo&s;ques, three Colleges, and about two hundred Sepulchres of the De&s;cendants of <HI>Aly.</HI> The Principal Mo&s;que &s;tands right again&s;t the great Market Place, having one Tower, that &s;erves for a Steeple, built of Free Stone. Both the Mo&s;que and the Tower are the Remainders of the Splendour of the fir&s;t Mahumetans, who invaded <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>The Hou&s;es of <HI>Ca&s;han</HI> are built of Earth and Bricks, of which there few that are remarkable. But the Bazars and Baths are lovely Structures, well built and well kept. There are al&s;o &s;everal Inns. That which is call'd the <HI>Royal Inn</HI> with|out the City, joyning to the Gate that looks toward the Ea&s;t, is the faire&s;t not only in <HI>Ca&s;han,</HI> but in all <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> It is four &s;quare, every front within-&s;ide being two hundred Geometri|cal Paces, and two Stories with an Anti-Chamber, or Hollow|ne&s;s below that runs all-along the length ofthe two Fronts, rais'd about the height of a man above the Court, and four Inches below the level of the Chamber. It is eight foot deep, pav'd with white Marble, almo&s;t as tran&s;parent as Pophiry. The Stories on the &s;ides contain fifteen Chambers of the &s;ame Fi|gure: the two others had but ten, with a large one in the middle, having five Chambers. The other Apartments con|&s;i&s;ted of one Chamber, fifteen foot long and ten broad, high and vaulted, with a Chimney in the middle, and a &s;quare <HI>Por|tico</HI> before, ten foot wide, cover'd with a half <HI>Duomo,</HI> with a Contrivance for a Chimney on each &s;ide; which was for the Servants to lodge in. The &s;econd Story was contriv'd like that below, with a Balu&s;ter four foot high, that let in the the Light, and ran round the Structure. In the Geometrical Part of the Draught, you may perceive a Hexagonal in the mid&s;t of the Entrance, every Front of which is a large Shop, where are to be &s;old all manner of Belly-Timber, Wood and Forrage. The Entrance is under a high and magnificent Por|tal, adorn'd with <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> Work, like all the re&s;t of the Build|ding; and upon the &s;ides runs a <HI>Portico,</HI> where you may lie in the day time as conveniently and as plea&s;antly, as in the Inn it &s;elf. The Fountain in the middle of the Court is rai&s;'d a|bove five foot: and the Brims of it are four foot broad, for the Convenience of tho&s;e that will &s;ay their Prayers after they have perform'd their Purifications.</P>

There is al&s;o &s;omewhat that does not appear in the Draught, that is to &s;ay, the hinder part of the <HI>Carevan&s;eray,</HI> which is worthy to be ob&s;erv'd in this place. For it con&s;i&s;ts of very large Stables, with places for Servants and Luggage, built al|mo&s;t according to the &s;ame Symmetry, as the Apartments al|ready mention'd; at lea&s;t as to the Form and Bigne&s;s of &s;tore-Hou&s;es, and Lodgings for the Poor, and the Country people that bring their Goods to &s;ell; and the large Gardens, that lie be|hind this lovely <HI>Palace of a Caravan&s;eray:</HI> no le&s;s famous for its Founder <HI>Abas</HI> the Great, who caus'd this &s;umptuous Structure to be erected. Near adjoyning to it &s;tands the Palace Royal; and over again&s;t it, another de&s;ign'd for the Lodging of Emba&s;&s;adors. Both the one and the other, with very large Gardens behind 'em, were built at the Charges of that Re|nowned Monarch: be&s;ides that there is in the middle a void Space for their Carou&s;els, and other Exerci&s;es on Hor&s;e|back.</P>
<P>The Wealth and Trade of <HI>Ca&s;han</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in the Manifactuary of all &s;orts of Silk, Stufs, and Ti&s;&s;ues of Gold and Silver. There is not made in any place of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> more Sattin, Velvet, Tabby, Plain Ti&s;&s;ue, and with Flowers of Silk, or Silk min|gled with Gold and Silver, then is made in this City, and the Parts round about it: &s;o that one &s;ingle Borrough in this Ter|ritory, contains a thou&s;and Hou&s;es of Silk-Weavers. That which is call'd <HI>Aron,</HI> &s;eeming at a di&s;tance to be a good big City, as containing in it no le&s;s than two thou&s;and Hou&s;es, and &s;ix hundred Gardens: It is about two Leagues from <HI>Ca|&s;han.</HI></P>
<P>The City of <HI>Ca&s;han</HI> &s;tands in a good Air, but violently hot, in&s;omuch that it is ready to &s;tifle yee in the Summer. Which extream Heat is occa&s;ion'd by its Situation; as lying near a high Mountain oppos'd to the South. The Reverberation of which &s;o furiou&s;ly heats the place in the Dog-Days, that it &s;calds again. Be&s;ides, there is one greater Inconvenience more trouble&s;ome and more dangerous, which is the great number of Scorpions that infe&s;t tho&s;e parts at all times, e&s;pe|cially when the Sun is in <HI>Scorpio:</HI> Travellers are terribly threat|ned by 'em: And yet for my part, (thanks be to God) I ne|ver &s;aw any in all the time that I pa&s;s'd through the Country. Neither could I hear of any great Mi&s;chief that they had done. It is &s;aid, that <HI>Abas</HI> the Great's A&s;trologers in the Year 1623. invented a <HI>Tali&s;man</HI> to deliver the City from tho&s;e Vermin;

&s;ince which time there has not appear'd &s;o many as before. But there is no Credit to be given to the&s;e idle &s;tories; no more then to that &s;ame other, that if Travellers &s;topping at <HI>Ca|&s;han,</HI> are but careful at their entrance into their Inns, to &s;peak the&s;e words, <HI>Scorpious, I am a Stranger, meddle not with me,</HI> no <HI>Scorpion</HI> will come near 'em. For the&s;e are meet Tales. However certain it is, that their &s;ting is very dangerous: And therefore it has given occa&s;ion to an Imprecation frequent|ly in the Mouths of the Per&s;ians, <HI>May the Scorpions of Ca&s;han &s;ting thy Golls.</HI> However there is no Body, but has by him &s;e|veral &s;overaign Remedies again&s;t the &s;ting of this Creature. This City lies in 35. deg. 35. min. of Lat. and 86. deg. of Longitude. Cattel and wild Fowl are not very plentiful in tho&s;e parts; but it abounds in Corn and Fruits. They car|ry from thence to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> the fir&s;t Melons and Water-Me|lons which are eaten in that City; which they furni&s;h with va&s;t numbers, as long as the &s;ea&s;on for Fruit endures.</P>
<P>Several European Authors hold <HI>Ca&s;han</HI> to be &s;ame place, which the Ancient Greek Authors call <HI>Ambrodux,</HI> or el&s;e that which was call'd <HI>Cte&s;iphon of the</HI> Country of the <HI>Parthians.</HI> The Per&s;ian Hi&s;toriansaver, that it owes its Re&s;tauration to <HI>Zebd-le|ca-ton</HI> the Wife of <HI>Haron-Re&s;hid,</HI> Califf of <HI>Bagdat.</HI> They ob&s;erve moreover, that this Prince&s;s was a Virgin when &s;he fir&s;t be|gan to build the City, and that for that rea&s;on &s;he laid the fir&s;t Stone when the Sun enter'd <HI>Virgo.</HI> She gave it the name of <HI>Ca&s;an</HI> in honour of <HI>Ca&s;an</HI> her Grand-father, the Grand-child of <HI>Haly,</HI> who di'd and was enterr'd in that Place; of which there hap|pened &s;ome alteration afterwards, through the error of poin|ing: For it is well known to people ver&s;ed in the Ea&s;tern Languages, that &s;uch a mi&s;take &s;o ea&s;ily committed, changes the letter S, into that which is call'd <HI>Shin. Tamerlan,</HI> be|ing become Ma&s;ter of this City, &s;par'd it in a Humour, as they &s;ay, when he had de&s;troy'd almo&s;t all the other Cities of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> It is call'd by another name <HI>Darel-mou-menin,</HI> or the <HI>Habitation of the Faithful;</HI> either becau&s;e the De&s;cendants from <HI>Aly,</HI> and his fir&s;t Followers made it a Sanctuary and Retreat during the Per&s;ecutions of the <HI>Califfs,</HI> who would not embrace his Opinions, but held a contrary belief; or el&s;e becau&s;e a great number of the De&s;cendants of that Califf lie there enterr'd Their Graves are confus'd among tho&s;e that lie buried round bout; the Monuments that were erected over 'em having bin beaten down by the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars,</HI> that invaded tho&s;e

places; and &s;acrific'd tho&s;e &s;tructures to the honour of their Saints, the grand Enemies and Per&s;ecutors of the De&s;cendants of <HI>Aly.</HI> They made &s;earch for the&s;e Graves, after the Califf became Ma&s;ter of the City again: but how ea&s;ily they may be deceiv'd in this &s;earch is no difficult thing to conjecture. For in the Year 1667. they found out one that put the whole City into confu&s;ion. For they affirm'd the Grave upon which a large Monument had been built a hundred years be|fore, out of an a&s;&s;urance that one of <HI>Aly</HI>'s de&s;cendants was bu|ried there, to be the Sepulcher of one <HI>Yuzbec,</HI> a Preacher. The People enrag'd that they had wor&s;hipped for a whole Age together a Place in their Opinion more worthy of Exe|cration, ran in a heat to pull down the Monument, dug down the Earth that was at the top, and round about it, and made a common road over it. But what happen'd af|terwards is much more Remarkable. And that is this, that one of the great <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Doctors undertook to write a Treati&s;e, on purpo&s;e; that there was never any &s;uch per&s;on as <HI>Yuzbec</HI> buri|ed there. Upon which the People again offended to &s;ee them&s;elves made the &s;port of their Doctors fancies, have left the place as indifferent, and will neither pollute, nor give it Reverence. The <HI>Governor</HI> of <HI>Ca&s;han</HI> carries the Title of a <HI>Darogu&eacute;,</HI> as do all the other Governors of the City's of <HI>Par|thia.</HI> A Lord that was one of my good Friends, call'd <HI>Ru|stan-bec,</HI> Brother to &s;everal Governors Provinces had the Government of that City, the fir&s;t time that I pa&s;s'd through it. The two years of his Government being ended, the City was &s;o well &s;atisfi'd in his conduct, that they &s;ent &s;ome of their Members to petition that he might be continu'd two years longer, but their Petition was rejected, as being con|trary to cu&s;tom to continue &s;uch Officers longer then the u&s;ual time.</P>
<P>The 19. our Hor&s;es were &s;o tir'd that we were forc'd to &s;tay at <HI>Ca&s;han.</HI> We departed the 29. and travell'd &s;even Leagues; the two fir&s;t cro&s;s the Plain where the City was built: the re&s;t over a Mountain which was of a good height, but not difficult to a&s;cend. At the top we met with a very large and fair <HI>Caravan&s;eray,</HI> and a little further with a wide Lake, which &s;erves for a Receptacle to receive the melted Snow and Rain that falls from the Parts thereabouts; from whence they let go the water into the Plain of <HI>Ca&s;han,</HI> as they have need.</P>
<P><PB N="416" REF="214">
<HI>Abas</HI> the Great, rais'd up two &s;trong Dams about it, to the end it might hold more Water; and to prevent the Wa|ter from wa&s;ting. He al&s;o caus'd &s;everal Cau&s;eys to be made in the &s;ame place for the Convenience of Travellers. Be|ing de&s;cended from the Mountain, you enter into a deep Val|ley, very narrow and about a League in length: all which &s;pace of Ground is &s;tor'd with Hou&s;es, Vine|yards, and Gardens &s;o clo&s;e one to another, that it &s;eems to be but one Village of a League in length. Several de|lightful and clean Streams derive their Springs from that Plain, which pre&s;erve the Air wonderfully cool all the Summer; &s;o that it is a place the mo&s;t charming and delightful that a man &s;hall meet with in that &s;corching Climate. For the Sun has &s;o little Power there, that the Ro&s;es were not then blown; the Corn and Fruit were al&s;o then green and but half ripe; and yet they had reap'd their Harve&s;t, and had eaten ripe Fruit a <HI>Ca&s;han</HI> at month before. We lodg'd at the end of that lovely Plain, in a <HI>Caravan&s;eray</HI> there built, which they call'd <HI>Carou.</HI></P>
<P>Some of our own modern Authors a&s;&s;ert, That this Valley was the Place where <HI>Darius</HI> was murder'd, which is not im|probable, for that the Hi&s;tory ob&s;erves, that <HI>Be&s;&s;us</HI> and <HI>Na|barzanes,</HI> after they had committed that Treacherous Murder upon the Prince, took &s;everal Roads, the one for <HI>Hyrcania,</HI> and the other for <HI>Bactriana;</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;han</HI> is exactly the Place that leads directly to tho&s;e two Provinces.</P>
<P>The 21, we travell'd eight Leagues; two along the foot of the Mountains between which that Valley lies; and &s;ix in a plea&s;ant Vale, &s;tor'd with a great number of Villages: where we met with &s;everal <HI>Caravan&s;eray's</HI> upon the Road; we alighted at one that was larger and fairer then the re&s;t, call'd <HI>Aga-Kemal,</HI> from the name of a rich Merchant that built it, and &s;everal other publick Structures about <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI></P>
<P>The 22. our Journeys was not above five Leagues in the &s;ame Plain, where <HI>Aga-Kemal</HI> &s;tands. We travell'd &s;o hard, that by nine a Clock at night we arriv'd at <HI>Mout&s;hacour,</HI> which is a large Village con&s;i&s;ting of about five hundred Hou&s;es, where there are &s;everal Inns and Gardens, and great plenty of Water,</P>
<P>The 23. we &s;et forward late, to the end we might not come to <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> before day. We travell'd the nine Leagues, which we had to ride, over lovely Plains, &s;till directing our

We enter'd the City by five a Clock in the Morning, all in good health, Thanks be to God.</P>

<HEAD>The CORONATION of SOLYMAN The Third of that Name <HI>And the Two hundred thirty fourth King of</HI> Per&s;ia.</HEAD>
<P>_SUch was the End of <HI>Habas</HI> the &s;econd of Glorious Memory, that his Death may well be look'd upon to have been a Judgment of Heaven upon that Potent Empire which he all along &s;o prudently governed; and as a Misfortune that at the &s;ame time befel &s;everal Millions of People that were under his Dominion. The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> never &s;peak of him, but they give him all the <HI>Encomiums</HI> of a Magnanimous Prince, who&s;e Courage and good Conduct had already contributed, in an extraordinary manner, to the Re|e&s;tabli&s;hment of their Country: and who had que&s;tionle&s;s re&s;to|red it to its ancient Splendor, and to a perfect Pro&s;perity, had his Life been of a longer continuance. In a word, they had great rea&s;on to promi&s;e them&s;elves, that he would have rendred both the one and the other Diuturnal as well as Univer&s;al, in regard his Heroic Vertues had Crowned him with Victory before he had arrived to the Age of nineteen Years, by the Conque&s;t of the City and whole Province of <HI>Kaud-dar,</HI> bordering upon the utmo&s;t Confines of the whole Kingdom; and that too, from an Enemy no le&s;s Powerful than the <HI>Indian</HI> Monarch; and after|wards when he defended it again&s;t the whole Force of the &s;ame Prince, Mu&s;tered together in one Body to regain it. The &s;ame Virtues they were that made him formidable to his Potent Neighbours, the Duke of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> the Monarch of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and the Pui&s;&s;ant King of <HI>India</HI> him&s;elf: Who being di&s;couraged by the Ill &s;ucce&s;s of his fir&s;t Enterprize of which we have already given an account, would never venture any more to mole&s;t him.</P>
<P>The &s;ame tran&s;cendent Virtues in a Bre&s;t &s;o truly Royal, even at the very time that Death &s;urprized him, &s;pur'd him on to ex|tend his Dominions towards the North and Ea&s;t. And the Preparations which he had made for that purpo&s;e, gave the whole World occa&s;ion to fear that his De&s;ign would infallibly &s;ucceed. The Chri&s;tians, who had the happine&s;s to live under his Subjection, to this day lament in private his Decea&s;e, not only as a King, but as a Parent. For his Ju&s;tice and his Good|ne&s;s

would never &s;uffer any violence to be offered them, or that they &s;hould be di&s;turbed for their Religion, which they had free Liberty to exerci&s;e during his Reign, as being a Per&s;on in whom tho&s;e Royal Virtues were &s;tedfa&s;t and unalterable: which always prevented the Fury of the Cruel and Impious <HI>Mahometans</HI> from mole&s;ting the Peace and Tranquillity of their Lives or E&s;tates. And hence it is that Strangers &s;till and ever will bewail his lo&s;s and bear in Remembrance his more than ordi|nary Endowments; as He that by by his Affability and Libera|lity invited them continually to his Court and Cities under his Obedience, and employed a great part of the Tribute which he drew from his Subjects in the purcha&s;e of their co&s;tly Mer|chandi&s;e which they brought along with them, paying both generou&s;ly and punctually what they in rea&s;on demanded.</P>
<P>Toward the Conclu&s;ion of that account which we have given of the Life of this Great Prince, we have &s;hewn that the cau&s;e of his Death was that &s;ame nau&s;eous Di&s;temper which good Manners will not permit to be named, and of which the Pollution is yet more un&s;eemly; and which notwith&s;tanding all the En|deavours of Art to conceal it, di&s;plays it &s;elf in the Faces of the Di&s;ea&s;ed, and publi&s;hes with Ignominy their frequent Con|ver&s;e with lewd Women: We have al&s;o told you that his Death happened in one of his Hou&s;es of Plea&s;ure &s;eated in the Province of <HI>Teber E&s;toon,</HI> two Leagues from <HI>Damagaan,</HI> according to the Per&s;ian Geographers lying in 78. <HI>Degrees,</HI> and 15. <HI>Minutes</HI> of <HI>Longi|tude,</HI> and 37. <HI>degrees,</HI> 20. <HI>Minutes</HI> of <HI>Latitude,</HI> twelve days Journey from the Capital City of the Empire, and nine days Journey from the <HI>Ca&s;pian Sea:</HI> And this hou&s;e of Plea&s;ure inviting &s;everal of the Country People to &s;ettle round about it, was the Rea&s;on that at length it grew to be a con&s;iderable Village, to which the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> gave the Name of <HI>Co&s;roe-Abaad,</HI> or the Habitation of <HI>Co&s;roes,</HI> who was a Prince, formerly Governour of the Province where this Village is &s;ituated; and the &s;ame that built this Palace of Plea&s;ure, in the Reign of <HI>Sefi</HI> the fir&s;t, Grand|father to the pre&s;ent King. But not long after this <HI>Co&s;roes</HI> falling into Di&s;grace, the King confi&s;cated his Hou&s;e and all his E&s;tate after he had put the Governour him&s;elf to Death, of which I &s;hall &s;ay no more at pre&s;ent, as being a Subject not proper for this Place.</P>
<P>We have al&s;o in the &s;ame Relation &s;et down the Time of this Prince's unfortunate Decea&s;e, which happened upon the 26. of the Moon which they call <HI>Rabeia el Atier de l'Egere</HI> 1077. or ac|cording to the Chri&s;tian Account, upon the 25. of <HI>September,</HI>

<P>We have al&s;o farther related, how that an Hour before, the Principal Eunuchs ob&s;erving in the Prince's Eyes the Signs of Approaching Death, thought it fit to put out of the Room all the Women that were with him, for fear le&s;t at the moment of his la&s;t Ga&s;p, the Tran&s;ports of their Grief, and their loud Outcries, might di&s;cover a Secret, which it was &s;o nece&s;&s;ary at that time to conceal. To that purpo&s;e they per&s;waded them that the King was a&s;leep, and de&s;ired them therefore to retire for fear of di&s;turbing his Repo&s;e. This had been prudently done, if the per&s;ons that &s;eemed to be &s;o wi&s;e, had had &s;ufficient Re|&s;olution and Courage them&s;elves. But at the Fatal Moment they could not them&s;elves forbear to ca&s;t forth tho&s;e loud &s;ighs, which betrayed the Truth to the Ladies, &s;o that they had pre|&s;ently alarm'd the whole Camp with their Piercing Cries and Lamentations, had not the Eunuchs be&s;ought them to forbear but for a while, at a time when the welfare of the Empire lay at Stake. To which the di&s;con&s;olate Prince&s;&s;es &s;ubmitted as much as the Importunity of their Grief would give them leave.</P>
<P>And here we are to ob&s;erve by the way, that the Rea&s;on why the Women upon &s;uch occa&s;ions are &s;o deeply afflicted, is not only for the lo&s;s of the King their Husband, but for the lo&s;s of that &s;hadow of Liberty which they enjoyed during his Life. For no &s;ooner is the Prince laid in his Tomb, but they are all &s;hut up in particular Hou&s;es, plea&s;ant enough tis true for their Situation, and where they want for nothing, but what is all in all to them, their only happine&s;s in this World, Conver&s;ation with Men. Which is a Satisfaction &s;o &s;everely debarred them, that they are not allowed &s;o much as the &s;ight of a Man.</P>
<P>The Eunuchs therefore having con&s;ulted among them&s;elves, in the mid&s;t of their fears le&s;t the Croud of over-ha&s;ty Vi&s;i|tants pre&s;&s;ing in at un&s;ea&s;onable hours, &s;hould awaken &s;u&s;picious Curio&s;ity, re&s;olved to &s;tay till the Sun was up, and then to give Notice of the Kings Death to the two Chief <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> of <HI>State,</HI> who were two Illu&s;trious Per&s;onages, that had had the Manage|ment of Affairs under the decea&s;ed King, with an Authority almo&s;t equal to his own. To which purpo&s;e they deputed two of their Society, the <HI>Mehter,</HI> who&s;e Office in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Court an&s;wers to that of our <HI>High-Chamberlain,</HI> according to the mean|ing
<PB N="4" REF="222">
of the <HI>Arabian</HI> word, which &s;ignifies the <HI>Highe&s;t.</HI> The other deputed Eunuch was called the <HI>Aga-Kafour,</HI> a Per&s;on already well in years, and the chiefe&s;t of tho&s;e that had the Cu&s;tody of the Kings Trea&s;ury; as to whom the Prince had more par|ticularly entru&s;ted all his Jewels.</P>
<P>The&s;e two came to the chief Mini&s;ters Lodgings, as if they had been &s;ent by his Maje&s;ty, cau&s;ed them to put forth all the Women out of the Room, and then informed them of the Death of <HI>Habas</HI> the Second, giving them an exact and punctual Ac|count; which was, That the day before, toward the Evening, after tho&s;e Mini&s;ters were retired from the Kings Pre&s;ence, the Prince had eaten heartily certain Sweet-Meats which his Wives had provided; after which he &s;eemed to be much better than he had been for &s;ome time before, till about Nine of the Clock at Night; at what time of a &s;udden he fell into a Swoon, where|upon they ran to him and laid him upon his Bed: That about Eleven of the Clock he came again to him&s;elf, not without &s;ome di&s;turbance of his Sen&s;es. That after that his Pains augmented, not having received any Benefit from two Medicins that he had taken by the Direction of his Phy&s;icians: That about Two of the Clock in the Morning the Violence of his Di&s;temper &s;lackned; but returning about Three, put him into a <HI>Delirium</HI> that la&s;ted about half an Hour: but the next half hour he took &s;ome Re&s;t. But toward four in the Morning, his Eyes then faintly rolling in his Head, gave evident &s;igns of Deaths Approach: &s;o that at the &s;ame in&s;tant he expired without any other Motion, that they could &s;ay, they perceived him die. Nor indeed had he te&s;ti|fied during the whole Cour&s;e of his Sickne&s;s that he had the lea&s;t Apprehen&s;ion or Fear of Death: In&s;omuch that he had left no Orders either as to the Di&s;po&s;al of his Body, nor as touching his Family nor Succe&s;&s;or, only in the height of his la&s;t Fit, turn|ing his Head toward the Publick Apartment, he utter'd with &s;ome kind of Fury the&s;e words; <HI>I know that you have poy&s;oned me, but you &s;hall drink a good &s;hare of the Poy&s;on; for I leave behind me a Son who after my Death &s;hall devour your very Hearts.</HI></P>
<P>This News did not a little &s;urpri&s;e the two Mini&s;ters, who did not believe the Kings Sickne&s;s had been &s;o mortal, or at lea&s;t that it would have killed him &s;o &s;oon: and they had ju&s;t rea&s;on, both, to bewail their lo&s;s; but the &s;econd di&s;played more vi&s;ible &s;igns of his Grief, as lo&s;ing infinitely much more than his Companion.</P>
<P>For <HI>Habas,</HI> ob&s;erving a Piece of Policy not u&s;ual among the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> re&s;olved to counter-balance the Power of his Prime
<PB N="5" REF="222">
<HI>Mini&s;ter,</HI> believing it would be of advantage to the Government, that Emulation &s;hould render his Mini&s;ters more intent upon their Duty: Which was the rea&s;on that he advanced this &s;e|cond Per&s;on to that Degree, that he was nothing inferior in Autho|rity to the fir&s;t, and put into his Hands the mo&s;t important Af|fairs of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>It was very probable that <HI>Habas</HI>'s Succe&s;&s;or, would not be of his Fathers judgment, but that all things would return to their fir&s;t Method. Which mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly touched the &s;econd Mi|ni&s;ter, who &s;aw him&s;elf tumbling into a more Private Condition; and that there was no higher Employment to be expected for him, unle&s;s it were the Superintendency of the Kings Hou&s;hold; which was nothing comparable to the pre&s;ent Offices which he enjoyed.</P>
<P>So that he could not forbear at fir&s;t from manife&s;ting the Exce&s;s of his Grief, but the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Lords being accu&s;tomed to di&s;&s;emble, he &s;oon compo&s;ed his Countenance and modera|ted his Sorrows. Which having done, he told the Eunuch, that the Grandees of the Empire &s;hould be privately called together, and that he would forthwith appoint both Time and Place for their Meeting, which was the An&s;wer al&s;o of the fir&s;t Mini&s;ter to the High Chamberlain.</P>
<P>In the mean time the two chief Phy&s;icians <HI>Mirza-Sahid</HI> and <HI>Mirza-Koudchek</HI> his Brother, con&s;iderable Lords in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Court (for in the Ea&s;tern Countries Phy&s;icians are much more highly e&s;teemed and advanced than in <HI>Europe,)</HI> the&s;e Lords, I &s;ay, coming to the Door of the Royal Apartment for the Women, pre&s;ently after the two great Eunuchs were gone, there had notice of the Kings Death, and con&s;equently of their own Ruin. For that according to the Cu&s;tom of that Empire, the Life of the two chief Phy&s;icians, or at lea&s;t their Fortune and E&s;tates depend upon the Life of the Prince whom they attended in his Sickne&s;s. For the &s;ame Week that the King died, they are exiled to &s;ome remote and prefixed Place, whither they are not &s;uffered to carry any more of their E&s;tates along with them than will &s;uffice for a bare Maintenance; the re&s;t is Confi&s;cated. Which was al&s;o their lot, as &s;hall be &s;aid in due place.</P>
<P>But neither the lo&s;s of their Ma&s;ter, nor of their Liberty had &s;o di&s;ordered their judgments, as to hinder them from con&s;ulting their own pre&s;ervation at &s;uch a tickli&s;h Conjuncture. Only one thing di&s;turbed them more than all the re&s;t, and that was the Report of the Kings la&s;t words, when he complained of be|ing Poy&s;oned. For there was enough in tho&s;e words to condemn
<PB N="6" REF="223">
them to the &s;evere&s;t of Torments, if the &s;ucceeding Prince &s;hould give credit to tho&s;e la&s;t Speeches of a Dying Monarch.</P>
<P>To rid them&s;elves therefore from the&s;e Fears, they re&s;olved between them&s;elves, to throw the Election upon the Younge&s;t of all <HI>Habas's</HI> Sons, who being as yet but an Infant, would in all likelihood continue a long time under the Tuition of his Mother, and his Mini&s;ters, from whom they could not expect to &s;uffer any thing that was Fatal or Dreadful.</P>
<P>And here we mu&s;t ob&s;erve that <HI>Habas</HI> the &s;econd left behind him two Sons; or at lea&s;t I never heard that he left any more. Nor is it known whether he left any Daughters or no. For what is done in the Womens Apartment is a My&s;tery concealed even from the Grandees and Prime Mini&s;ters. Or if they know any thing, it is meerly upon the account of &s;ome particular Re|lation or dependence which the Secret has to &s;ome peculiar Af|fair which of nece&s;&s;ity mu&s;t be imparted to their Knowledg. For my part I have &s;pared neither for pains nor co&s;t to &s;ift out the Truth: But I could never di&s;cover any more, only that they believed he never left any Daughter behind him that lived. A man may walk a Hundred days one after another by the Hou&s;e where the Women are, and yet know no more what is done there, than at the farther end of <HI>Tartary.</HI></P>
<P>Now of the&s;e two Sons of <HI>Habas</HI> the Elde&s;t who was called <HI>Sofie-Mirza,</HI> was then entring into his one and twentieth Year; be|ing Born in the year of the <HI>Egire,</HI> 1057. for the &s;uper&s;tition of the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> will not let us know the Month or the Day. Their Addiction to A&s;trology is &s;uch that they carefully conceal the Moments of their Prince's Birth, to prevent the Ca&s;ting their Nativities, where they might meet perhaps with &s;omething which they &s;hould be unwilling to know. His Father begot him at Eighteen years of Age enamoured of a <HI>Circa&s;&s;ian</HI> Slave, or <HI>Cherkes,</HI> in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Language; who&s;e extraordinary Beauty and rare Endowments &s;o won the Affection of that Monarch that &s;he was the fir&s;t of all his Women that he cho&s;e for a Wife; For which rea&s;on during her Husbands Life &s;he was called <HI>Nekaat Kanum,</HI> or the <HI>Lawful Dutche&s;s;</HI> tho there were al&s;o other Wo|men, which were his Lawful Wives according to the Law and Cu&s;tom of that Country.</P>
<P>This Elde&s;t Son, according to Cu&s;tom was bred up in the Womens Palace, and committed to the Care of certain Eunuchs under the Eye of his Mother and his Nur&s;e. who was a Lady of great Quality, and the Wife of <HI>Mu&s;taufie-Elmemalek,</HI> which according to the force of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> words, &s;ignifies a <HI>Watcher</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="223">
<HI>over Kingdoms.</HI> There he was bred up with all the Tenderne&s;s and Pomp, that his High Birth required, and enjoyed all the Liberty that could be allowed to a Per&s;on of his Quality; which was to go up and down over all that &s;pacious Palace where he plea&s;ed him&s;elf: for to go further into the Mens Apart|ments is by no means permitted tho&s;e young Princes.</P>
<P>When he arrived at the Age of &s;eventeen Years, an Accident befel him that rendered his Confinement much more clo&s;e. For it happened that an Eunuch brought him &s;ome Peices of Cloth of Ti&s;&s;ue, at what time the Prince being of a haughty Temper, and not thinking them Rich enough, rejected them with very &s;cornful and &s;lighting Language: nor was he better plea&s;ed when it was told him that the Peices were &s;ent him by the Order of the King his Father. Which being carried back and perhaps aggravated to the jealous Monarch; his Maje&s;ty believing that the overmuch Liberty which was allowed the young Prince did but &s;erve to heighten his Arrogance and aug|ment his natural Pride, confined him to the remote&s;t Part of all the Palace.</P>
<P>Some per&s;ons were of opinion that he would have cau&s;ed his Eyes to have been put out. But when they found that the Walls of the Place to which he was confined were ordered to be rai&s;ed, the more Intelligent Sort believed that the King would not pro|ceed to that Extremity of Rigour; for that he would not have been &s;o careful to prevent the E&s;cape of one that was Blind, who&s;e Misfortune would have been &s;ufficient to render him incapable to attempt any Enterprize of that nature.</P>
<P>However when the King was &s;etting forward for <HI>Mazendaran</HI> in the year 1665. according to our Computation, his Actions were &s;uch, that even the Grandees and mo&s;t Politick Courti|ers began to &s;u&s;pect that he had then determined the Dreadful Execution. For he was not gone above Eight Leagues from <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> when he turned back again of a &s;udden toward the City with a very &s;mall Retinue, without imparting his De&s;ign to any one of all his Favourites: but when he arrived, all that he did was to enter unexpected into the Womens Apartment, where after he had &s;taid about two hours, he came forth again very Pen&s;ive and Melancholy.</P>
<P>Of which the Courtiers not being able to conjecture any other apparent Cau&s;e, attributed it to &s;ome Fatal Re&s;olution which the King had taken again&s;t the Prince his Son. Tho as it appeared after|wards they were all deceived in their judgments, and that there was another Motive that put him upon this &s;wift and &s;udden return.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="224">
For as to what concerned this Young Prince, his Father was &s;atisfied with his clo&s;e Confinement in a Quarter of the Apartment remote from the re&s;t, in the Company of his Mo|ther and &s;uch Ladies as the King had appointed to attend her without &s;tinting her any Number: commiting him al&s;o to the farther care of the Great Eunuch <HI>Aga-Nazir,</HI> or the <HI>Per&s;picacious Lord,</HI> to ob&s;erve his Action, and to prevent him from attempt|ing any dangerous Enterprize.</P>
<P>This Word <HI>Nazir</HI> mo&s;t u&s;ually &s;ignifies &s;ome Superintendant or General Overfeer. And therefore the Per&s;on la&s;t mentioned, be&s;ides that he had the Tuition of the Prince, was Entru&s;ted al&s;o with the Government of the Womens Palace, and to over|look the Management of all Affairs of the Royal Hou&s;hold in <HI>Jepahan,</HI> an Employment which gave him great Credit and cau&s;ed him to be re&s;pected both in the Court and City. In both which Places he was highly e&s;teemed till the Death of his Ma&s;ter, be|ing as it were the Lieutenant and next to the Grand Superinten|dant of the Kingdom, who is likewi&s;e &s;til'd the <HI>Nazir.</HI></P>
<P>As for the Younger Son, he was about Eight Years of Age when his Father Died, being Born in the year of the <HI>Egira</HI> 1069. of an <HI>Iberian</HI> Lady or <HI>Gurgi,</HI> as the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> call them; to whom they gave the Title of <HI>Nour-Ni&s;&s;a-Kanum,</HI> which Signifies word for word, <HI>Dutche&s;s the Light of Women:</HI> the Young Prince him|&s;elf being called by the Name of <HI>Hamzeh Mirza:</HI> Tho I never could find or learn the true Signification of this word <HI>Hamzeh.</HI> I mu&s;t confe&s;s in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Language it an&s;wers to the word <HI>Apo&s;troph</HI> in our Tongue; but in that &s;ence I do not apprehend how it can &s;ignifie a Proper Name. Neverthele&s;s a Proper Name it is, whether it &s;ignifies &s;omething or nothing, and that mu&s;t &s;uffice.</P>
<P>As for the Title of <HI>Mirzah,</HI> it is as much as to &s;ay the Son of a Prince, as we have ob&s;erved in another Place, where we have di&s;covered more at large of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Names and Titles.</P>
<P>This Illu&s;trious Infant, as I have been informed by &s;everal of the Great Eunuchs, who &s;ometimes Attended upon him while He was with his Father in the Province of <HI>Mazendaran,</HI> where I was al&s;o a little before his Maje&s;ties Decea&s;e, was a Prince who&s;e Blooming Virtues promi&s;ed &s;omething more than Ordi|nary. For notwith&s;tanding the tenderne&s;s of his Corporeal Or|gans, the Strength of his Soul appeared in all his Actions, di&s;cover|ing &s;uch &s;igns of Noblene&s;s and Genero&s;ity, as plainly pre&s;aged that one day he would be a Glorious Prince.</P>
<P>Now whether the&s;e Signal Endowments had begot in <HI>Habas</HI> a
<PB N="9" REF="224">
greater Affection for him, than for his other Son: Or whether he were &s;waid by the mo&s;t u&s;ual Inclinations of Nature, which generally infu&s;e into Parents mo&s;t Tenderne&s;s for their Younger Children, he would needs have this Younger Son of his to ac|company him in his journey. Tho others believed that it was rather to gratifie his Mother, with who&s;e Beauty the King was extremely enamoured, &s;o that contrary to cu&s;tom he made her a Partaker with him in his Royal Bed, tho two and twenty years of Age, and carried her along with him where ever he took his Progre&s;s. And in this la&s;t Progre&s;s wherein &s;he accompanied the King, &s;he had the &s;atisfaction to enjoy the Company of her be|loved Son, to whom the King a&s;&s;igned for Tutor and Guardian a Noble Eunuch, called <HI>Aga-Mubarik,</HI> or the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Thus this Young Prince hapning to be in this Hou&s;e of Plea|&s;ure, or of Sorrow rather, &s;eeing here it was that his Father ex|pired, was at hand to have Received the Diadem which the Grandees of the A&s;&s;embly might have pre&s;ented him, had the Con&s;piracy of the Two chief Phy&s;icians taken effect.</P>
<P>Nor was it their fault that it did not. For they managed their part with all the Prudence imaginable. And perhaps they might have laid their Plot before the Kings Death which by the Rules of their Art, they might ea&s;ily fore&s;ee. Not that they thought their Lives &s;o much in danger till they had notice of the Dying Kings la&s;t words, but only to &s;erve them&s;elves in their E&s;tates and Employments.</P>
<P>To this purpo&s;e they went to the Prime Mini&s;ter and under pretence of Informing him of the Kings Death and the Nature of the two la&s;t Medicins which they had pre&s;cribed him, they fell into di&s;cour&s;e of more Important Affairs; and talking of the Election, they put him in mind how much it concerned him and all the Grandees of the Council to take care of them&s;elves: that the King &s;ome Minutes before he Died, had made loud Com|plaints of being poy&s;oned by his chief Mini&s;ters, but that he left a Son that would devour their very hearts: that the&s;e his la&s;t words and Complaints could not be concealed from his Succe&s;&s;our. So that if they gave the Crown to the Elde&s;t, who be&s;ides that he was of the Age to take the Government into his own hands, and was of a haughty and cruel Di&s;po&s;ition, and therefore would not &s;tick to make u&s;e of this pretence to rid him&s;elf of all his chief Mini&s;ters and Nobility, to render him&s;elf by that means more ab&s;olute, and make room for other New Creatures of his own; more e&s;pecially when he came to con&s;ider how unkind his Father had been to him, for the two years la&s;t pa&s;t, which
<PB N="10" REF="225">
he would certainly attribute to the bad Coun&s;el of his chief Fa|vourites. Upon this they concluded, that &s;ince he could not chu&s;e but &s;ee that the Elde&s;t Son would never have any kindne&s;s for the pre&s;ent Grandees, that it would be a great piece of Im|prudence, to advance him to that Dignity which would em|power him to do all the Mi&s;chief that came into his Mind; and therefore at &s;uch a juncture of time their &s;afe&s;t way would be to confer the Election upon the Younge&s;t, <HI>Hamzeh-Mirzah;</HI> a Prince of great hopes, and from whom the Grandeur of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Em|pire might expect a long Continuance for the Future, and they at pre&s;ent have no rea&s;on to fear the Di&s;turbance of a &s;weet and calm Repo&s;e, or the lo&s;s of their Authority under a Prince that would not be capable of the Government in fourteen or fifteen Years.</P>
<P>The&s;e Arguments thus delivered by the two Lords, fir&s;t to the <HI>Prime Mini&s;ter,</HI> and then to the <HI>Second,</HI> wrought upon the Minds of Both as effectually as they could de&s;ire.</P>
<P>Both the One and the Other were convinced, and agreed to advance the Younger Son, in prejudice of the Elde&s;t. Their in|fallible Ruin hovered before their Eyes if the Elde&s;t came to the Crown: as one that &s;eeing him&s;elf from a Captive become an ab&s;olute Sovereign, would &s;oon be tran&s;ported by his Youth and Pride, and the plea&s;ure of unlimited Controul to change the Face of Affairs, and to take &s;uch Re&s;olutions as Humour and Ca|pricio &s;hould in&s;pire into him. And who knows, cried they to them|&s;elves, how far he may attempt upon our lives? But above all the Rumour of the Kings being poy&s;oned, was that which put them all upon the Rack: For tho they might be all very Inno|cent, yet the pretence was &s;o Plau&s;ible, that the very Terror of the Accu&s;ation repre&s;ented the continual fears of Death to their Eyes as dreadful as if they were under pre&s;ent Torment, &s;hould the Succe&s;&s;our to the Empire give Credit to the Rumour; where|as if they Elected the younge&s;t, they &s;hould &s;till keep their high Stations of Honour and Dignity; have lei&s;ure and oppor|tunity to advance their Families and rai&s;e Creatures of their own; Ruling all the while almo&s;t with an ab&s;olute Dominion one of the greate&s;t Empires of the World.</P>
<P>But now, that I may not &s;eem to contradict my &s;elf by &s;peaking frequently of the Kings being poy&s;oned, when I have already at the beginning of this Di&s;cour&s;e attributed his Death to another Cau&s;e, I mu&s;t beg of the Reader to make a &s;mall Digre&s;&s;ion, which I &s;uppo&s;e will not prove unplea|&s;ing, upon the &s;everal &s;u&s;picions which his Death begot
<PB N="11" REF="225">
in the various minds of tho&s;e that enquired more curiou&s;ly into the nature of his Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t true it is then, that the mo&s;t certain cau&s;e was that which I have already &s;et down, that is to &s;ay, the Foul di&s;ea&s;e attended with a <HI>Cancer,</HI> which &s;eizing the Gri&s;tle that forms the Conveyances of &s;melling, preyed not only outwardly up|on the No&s;e, but inwardly upon the Palate, and then falling upon the <HI>Uvula</HI> &s;topped up the pa&s;&s;ages of Re&s;piration. But they who imagined them&s;elves to be more quick-&s;ighted, and to under|&s;tand the bottom of things much better, would &s;till be whi&s;pering the Curious in the Ear, and I my &s;elf have been one of tho&s;e to whom it has been told for a great Secret, that &s;everal of the chief Officers of the outward Court, and &s;ome of the Eunuchs al&s;o of the inward Court, or Womens Apart|ment, had for &s;ome time before agreed among them&s;elves to rid them&s;elves of this Great Monarch, and to that purpo&s;e had made choice of Poy&s;on, as the mo&s;t &s;ecure way, and le&s;s apt to be di&s;covered. And that which in&s;tigated them to this devili&s;h Re&s;olution, was the frantick and furious humour of the Prince, of which every day &s;till produced extravagant and bloudy Te&s;timonies; which was come to that height, that being one day overcome with Wine, to which he was extreme|ly addicted, he had cut the Throat of one of his mo&s;t beautiful and legitimate Wives without any offence or other cau&s;e given: that he had done the &s;ame to &s;everal of his Dome&s;tick Servants; &s;o that the re&s;t dreading the like Misfortune, and untimely Ends, &s;uffered them&s;elves to be tempted into this execrable de&s;ign of giving him a Potion, that &s;hould wa&s;te him by degrees, and give him a &s;low Death, which &s;hould not be perceived till it came to pa&s;s. Others confe&s;&s;ed that in his drunken fits he had committed tho&s;e cruel Acts of which he was accu&s;ed, yet that never any body attempted to poy&s;on him for all that; but that it was rather a &s;ecret &s;hame and inward grief for having abandoned him&s;elf to &s;uch wild and extravagant Tran&s;ports that gnawed and devoured his heart. However it were, the Rumour of his being poy&s;oned was never any other than a Rumour, and was always looked upon as a Dream for which there was no ground; tho had the bu&s;ine&s;s been more exactly enquired into, the truth perhaps might have come to light ac|cording to the Report.</P>
<P>After the two chief Eunuchs, and chief Phy&s;icians had given an account of the Kings Death to the Prime Mini&s;ters, they went al&s;o to inform the other Lords of the Council, &s;till
<PB N="12" REF="226">
keeping the Secret as private as they could for fear the People or the Soldiers &s;hould come to have the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of it. At the &s;ame time al&s;o they de&s;ired them to con&s;ider the nece&s;&s;ity of a&s;&s;embling together for the Welfare of the Empire, in regard the King was dead without declaring a Succe&s;&s;or either in writing or by word of Mouth. Whereupon the Lords approved their prudent Management, and agreed upon a Place where to a&s;&s;emble, &s;uch as &s;hould give no occa&s;ion to any per&s;on living, no not to their mo&s;t familiar acquaintance to take the lea&s;t Alarm.</P>
<P>To that purpo&s;e they made choice of the Place before the Gate of the Palace where the King lay &s;ick, where not only They, but all that belonged to the Court, were wont to appear about &s;even of the Clock in the Morning when the King re&s;ides in the Country. Whither repaired the whole Throng of Cour|tiers, not knowing any thing of the Accident. There al&s;o ap|peared the Lords who have their &s;hare in the Government, and went into certain little Tents, according to their u&s;ual Cu&s;tom, as well to expect the Kings coming forth, as to be ready at hand to receive his Commands; or for the di&s;patch of Affairs, which either need no an&s;wer at all from the King, or upon which they already know the King's mind.</P>
<P>For the better under&s;tanding of which, you are to know, as already has been declared in our Treati&s;e of the Government of the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> that when the King re&s;ides in the Country, they pitch him a large Camp in the Form of a City. In one of the extreme Quarters of which Camp they erect the Royal Pavilions: and about fifty Paces from thence the Tents of the Grand Ma&s;ter of the Royal Hou&s;hold: near to which they al&s;o &s;et up &s;everal le&s;&s;er Pavilions richly furni&s;hed on purpo&s;e for the Lords to &s;it down, di&s;cour&s;e one with another, or for the di&s;patch of Bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;uch as I have already men|tioned.</P>
<P>Nor is this Order of Encamping ever altered, although the King him&s;elf be lodged in a Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus it was an ea&s;ie thing for the Lords of the Council to a&s;&s;emble together without giving the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion to others; however to keep their de&s;ign the more clo&s;ely &s;till concealed, they came with their u&s;ual Trains and Habits, and with Coun|tenances &s;o well compo&s;ed, that notwith&s;tanding the various Emotions that agitated their different Pa&s;&s;ions, there outward|ly appeared nothing but &s;uch a &s;etled &s;atisfaction and content|ment of Mind, as would not permit them one among another to dive into each others Brea&s;ts.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="226">
The Lords being a&s;&s;embled in one of the&s;e forementioned Pavilions, which by accident was then erected in a Garden of the Village adjoyning to the Palace, next to the Pavilions of the grand <HI>Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;hold,</HI> placed them&s;elves in the &s;ame Order as they u&s;ed to &s;eat them&s;elves in the Kings Pre&s;ence.

Next to him &s;ate the <HI>Koelar-Aga&s;ia</HI> or Lord of the Slaves.

<P>Next to him &s;ate the <HI>Divaan-Beki;</HI> a word &s;o formed from the corruption of two other, <HI>Divaanum-Bek,</HI> or <HI>Lord of the Council of Ju&s;tice.</HI> And he that bears this Title is the &s;upreme Judge in all Civil and Criminal Cau&s;es, which come before him by way of Appeal from all parts of the Kingdom. Nor is there any one but the King him&s;elf who can &s;top the Execution and Sentence by him once pronounced. Next to whom &s;ate the <HI>Mir-Ateuer-Bachi,</HI> or <HI>Grand E&s;quire.</HI> For tho&s;e Per&s;ian words &s;ignifie, <HI>The Chief of the Princes of the Stables.</HI> The <HI>Hakiem-Bachi,</HI> or <HI>Chief of the Phy&s;icians,</HI> that is, the chief Phy|&s;ician and his Brother, were they that &s;ate lowermo&s;t upon the Right Hand.</P>
<P>On the Left Hand, he that held the uppermo&s;t Seat was <HI>Toefenktchi,</HI> or the <HI>Lord of the Musketeers,</HI> being the General of the third Body of the Per&s;ian <HI>Militia.</HI> Next to whom &s;ate the <HI>Vateaa-Noviez,</HI> or the <HI>Notary of Occurrencies,</HI> or of &s;uch Tran&s;|actions as relate to the Empire, and may be therefore &s;aid to be the principal Secretary of State.

di&s;tance below, &s;tood the two Eunuchs <HI>Aga-Kafour</HI> and <HI>Aga-Mahacite,</HI> of whom we have already made mention, as not being permitted, no more than the re&s;t of the Eunuchs, to &s;it before his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>The <HI>Meihter,</HI> or High Chamberlain &s;tood &s;omewhat higher upon the left hand, and a little behind, the High Steward of the Hou&s;hold, whom the Per&s;ians call <HI>Ichikaga&s;ia-Bachi;</HI> or <HI>Chief of the Ma&s;ters,</HI> or Lords of the <HI>Foot&s;tool to the Throne,</HI> becau&s;e his Authority extends over all the Porters, U&s;hers, Guards, Ma&s;ters of the Ceremonies, and other Officers of the like na|ture belonging to the Court. But becau&s;e he performs the Office of Chief Gentleman U&s;her night and day in the Kings Pre&s;ence, he has no Seat in the publick A&s;&s;emblies, notwith|&s;tanding his Authority be very great, and renders him more con&s;iderable than many that have right to &s;it. Nor do I find that any other Lords than the&s;e were pre&s;ent at this Grand A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>The chief Mini&s;ter was the fir&s;t that &s;poke, and declared at the &s;ame time what the High Chamberlain had informed him concerning the Kings Death, and which had been confirmed to him by the two chief Phy&s;icians: and then proceeding, he told him, <Q>That he made no que&s;tion but the &s;ame Informa|tion had already reached their Ears, and that they were not ignorant how that their decea&s;ed Monarch was departed this Life without declaring either in writing or by word of Mouth, to which of his two Sons he had bequeatched his Scepter, and that therefore it was their duty to proceed to an Election with all the &s;peed imaginable, not only becau&s;e it was not fit that the Prince to whom Providence had de&s;tined the Crown &s;hould remain in a Private Condition any longer, but al&s;o for the &s;ecurity of the Kingdom, which was al|ways in jeopardy &s;o long as it wanted a Governour, &s;ince it was with Monarchies as with living Bodies, that cea&s;e to live when deprived of the Head. For the preventing there|fore of &s;o great a Misfortune, it behoved them before they brake up, to make choice of &s;ome glorious Scien of the <HI>Imamic</HI> Race to &s;it upon the Throne which <HI>Habas</HI> the II. had quitted for a more ble&s;&s;ed Man&s;ion in Heaven. That that great Monarch of victorious Memory had left two Sons, as he was a&s;&s;ured that none of all the A&s;&s;embly had any rea&s;on to que&s;tion in the lea&s;t, <HI>Sephie-Mirza,</HI> who was about twenty years of Age, and had been left in the Palace of <HI>Grandeur,</HI> under the Tui|tion of <HI>Aga-Nazir;</HI> and <HI>Hamzeh-Mirza,</HI> about &s;even Years
<PB N="15" REF="227">
of Age, who was there among them at Court under the care of <HI>Aga-Mubarek</HI> pre&s;ent in their A&s;&s;embly: That of the&s;e two, after they had invoked the mo&s;t High God, they were to choo&s;e him that the well King had in a manner deputed to be Lieutenant to the glorious <HI>Succe&s;&s;or in Expectation.</HI></Q></P>
<P>By <HI>Succe&s;&s;or in Expectation</HI> the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> mean the la&s;t of the <HI>Imaans,</HI> who according to their Religion is their hoped for <HI>Me&s;&s;ia,</HI> who&s;e return to Earth they expect every hour.</P>
<P>Now the Prime Mini&s;ter having pronounced the&s;e words with all the Demon&s;trations of a profound &s;orrow, and an A&s;pect full of Maje&s;ty, which from his Aged Countenance &s;hot both Awe and Reverence, made a &s;udden &s;top, expecting that &s;ome other of the A&s;&s;embly &s;hould &s;peak and give his Ad|vice. But ob&s;erving that the whole A&s;&s;embly out of a par|ticular deference and re&s;pect to his Dignity and high Place, applauded his beginning, and by their frequent repetitions of <HI>Bi&s;in Allah',</HI> or <HI>&s;o be it, in the name of God,</HI> &s;eemed de&s;irous that he &s;hould proceed: the aged <HI>Mini&s;ter</HI> mode&s;tly re&s;umed his Place, and beholding the Grandees one after another, told them further, <Q>That con&s;idering the Nece&s;&s;ity, and the Re&s;olution which they had taken to Elect one of tho&s;e two Princes, it was his Opinion, That they were to the Rigorous but po&s;itive nece&s;&s;ity to which they were reduced, and which con&s;trained them to prefer <HI>Hamzeh Mirza</HI> tho the younger, and to fix him in the Throne, tho to the Privation of his elder Brother. The rea&s;on was, becau&s;e it was well known to all the World, how &s;evere <HI>Habas</HI> had been always toward him: &s;o that it was to be feared that the young Prince had been deprived of his &s;ight. Of which the Report had ran very hot, ever &s;ince the decea&s;ed Monarch at his departure from <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> di&s;played &s;uch a di&s;mal di&s;&s;atisfaction in his Coun|tenance, that portended nothing but fatal; and which they had more rea&s;on to believe, becau&s;e the King at the be|ginning of his &s;ickne&s;s, had &s;ent in great ha&s;t, without im|parting his de&s;ign to any of his Council, an Eunuch with private Orders to the &s;ame City. Which Orders could be no other than either to take off the Head, or pluck out the Eyes of the young Prince, to the end he might be uncapable of &s;ucceeding to the Crown after his death: For in all other things the King never failed to communicate his Secrets to &s;ome one of his Council, and particularly to the Prime Mini&s;ter, who was always accu&s;tomed to &s;eal with his own Seal, all &s;uch Commands and Orders to which the King
<PB N="16" REF="228">
affix'd his Signet, which if it were &s;o, they could not Elect him, without running them&s;elves into a great Confu&s;ion, if he &s;hould be already either Dead or Blind. For you know <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> that the &s;acred Laws of the Elect of God not permit|ing any per&s;on under that unfortunate Circum&s;tance to be our Sovereign Monarch, we &s;hould be con&s;trained after all to apply our &s;elves to <HI>Hamzeh Mirza.</HI> And what thanks I would fain know, will he then give us for our Election? Will he not have rea&s;on to tax us with our want of Affection, for choo&s;ing him at a force put, when we knew there was no po&s;&s;ibility for his Brother to govern? Will it plea&s;e him, do you think, to accept a Crown at our hands, which we have offered to another? Will he think him&s;elf beholden to us for our &s;uffrages which we did not give him out of Kindne&s;s or Affection to his per&s;on, but merely out of invincible Nece&s;&s;i|ty? And God grant he may &s;top there, with being only &s;a|tisfied that he ows us nothing. Who knows but that he may &s;tudy Revenge, and whether our Coldne&s;s may not kindle in his Bre&s;t a Fire that will not be quenched without our Ruin and the de&s;truction of our Families? But this is not all that we are to con&s;ider; when the Welfare of the Kingdom lies at &s;take, particular Intere&s;ts mu&s;t give way. Mind therefore my Lords, what I have ob&s;erved at the Beginning of my Di&s;cour&s;e. It be|hoves us to avoid the Dangers of an <HI>Interregnum,</HI> which will continue long, while time is wa&s;ted in Me&s;&s;ages to and fro from hence to the Capital City. But Providence hath put in|to our Hands <HI>Hamzeh-Mirza.</HI> What remains then but to follow the Commands of Providence, and forthwith to advance the Favoured of Heaven to the Sacred Throne of Prince of the World.</Q></P>
<P>The Prime Mini&s;ter having thus delivered him&s;elf, gave no &s;mall occa&s;ion to the re&s;t of the Lords to mu&s;e from whence this Opinion of his &s;hould proceed. But in regard he was a Per&s;on that had always lived in high Reputation for his Integrity, and for that his being &s;triken in years, and his long experience in Affairs rendered him greatly con&s;iderable, they never &s;u&s;pected the Advice which he had given had been the Effect of &s;elf-in|tere&s;t; more e&s;pecially becau&s;e there was nothing propounded but what the whole A&s;&s;embly believed to be very real. At length the greate&s;t part entertained a Propo&s;al &s;o acceptable to their wi&s;hes with great Joy: and they who only had in their view their own particular E&s;tabli&s;hment, were no le&s;s willing, in pur&s;uance of the Prime Mini&s;ters Coun&s;el, to be thought as
<PB N="17" REF="228">
well affected to the publick Welfare, when indeed they mind|ed nothing but their own Grandeur: For the &s;ame Con&s;iderations that had &s;way'd the Prime Mini&s;ter, and the <HI>Chief Superintendant,</HI> as we have &s;aid already, had got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their Minds likewi&s;e, and infu&s;ed into them an Apprehen&s;ion of the uncertainty of their Conditions, if <HI>Sephie-Mirza</HI> were advanced to the Throne. For that the Young Prince, were it only to &s;hew his Ab&s;olute Power; would Rule according to his own Fancy, and change his Officers as he plea&s;ed him&s;elf. Nor could they think other|wi&s;e but that &s;ome &s;ecret In&s;tigations of Revenge would govern his Proceedings again&s;t them, as being per&s;waded, that their Complacency had contributed to his Misfortunes; and that they were &s;o far from pacifying the di&s;plea&s;ure and complaints which the decea&s;ed King his Father made again&s;t him, that they had applauded and flattered his Indignation. On the other &s;ide, if the report were true of <HI>Habas</HI>'s being poy&s;oned by the Con&s;piracy of &s;ome of his Lords, it was ea&s;ie to conjecture how they that were guilty could not choo&s;e but feel a Remor&s;e of Con|&s;cience, and with what Terror they look'd upon a Succe&s;&s;or, who being naturally enclined to violence, would readily lay hold upon a Pretence &s;o plau&s;ible to revenge his Father's Death. But from the Election of the Younger Son there was no &s;uch Apprehen&s;ion of danger; in regard all things would move in their u&s;ual Cour&s;e, and for that his Minority would give them lei&s;ure to provide for them&s;elves, and to make the be&s;t advan|tage of the Employments which they enjoyed. Thereupon they weighed in the &s;ame Balance the Probabilities, which the Prime Mini&s;ter had &s;et forth, of the Death of the Elde&s;t of the two Princes, and the hazards which the Monarchy would run through a tedious Expectation. And therefore they all with one Voice concluded upon the Election of <HI>Hamzeh-Mirza.</HI></P>
<P>But among all the Grandees there was not any one that te&s;ti|fied &s;o violent a Pa&s;&s;ion for the Election of the Younge&s;t Son, as the <HI>Superintedant General:</HI> nor indeed was there any one who&s;e par|ticular Intere&s;t had more rea&s;on to urge him to it, as having more cau&s;e to fear the advancement of the Elder, than anyof the re&s;t. And moreover, he made no que&s;tion, that he would lay it to his Charge, that he had not the Furniture, the rich Cloaths, and other things that he de&s;ired: all which things by virtue of his Office of <HI>Superintendant,</HI> were at his di&s;po&s;al. On the other &s;ide he had done &s;everal kindne&s;&s;es for the Mother of the Younger Son, who&s;e Officer he was in the outward Palace, and then by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Eunuchs that attended her in the Womens Apart|ment,
<PB N="18" REF="229">
he was in hopes to work him&s;elf &s;o effectually into the Favour both of the Prince&s;s, and her Son, that he might be in a Condition to continue him&s;elf for a longer time in that high Credit, wherein he had lived, during the Reign of the Father. To which purpo&s;e when it came to his turn in Rank and Dignity, which was the third Place of Honour, to give his Opinion, it was with le&s;s indifference than tho&s;e that preceded him had done. He confirmed all that had been &s;aid by the <HI>Support of the Empire,</HI> or the Prime Mini&s;ter. He added moreover that he could not preci&s;ely tell in what Condition <HI>Sephie-Mirza</HI> was at that time; however that it could not be but very bad, or rather &s;o deplo|rable, that it would not &s;uffer either Him&s;elf, or any others in his behalf, to dream of the Empire: That for the pa&s;t Years of 1075. and 1076. after his Father had &s;hut him up under a clo&s;e Re&s;traint, He had been kept very private: That for him that &s;poke, he made no que&s;tion but that <HI>Habas</HI> had cau&s;ed the Eyes of the Prince to be put out, as not believing him fit to Govern. Of which there was nothing gave him greater A&s;&s;urances, than that there had been no mention made of the Prince &s;ince the Kings la&s;t Progre&s;s to <HI>Mazendaran,</HI> at what time the decea&s;ed King, being upon the Road not above eight Leagues di&s;tant from the Capital City, bru&s;h'd of a &s;udden back again in great ha&s;t, no man knowing either the I&s;&s;ue of his Return, nor why he went. And therefore there was no farther rea&s;on to doubt, but that he did it at length with a full determination to rid the world of that Young Prince. Nor did there need any other convincing Proof of what he &s;aid, than the Eunuch, who not long &s;ince had been di&s;patched with private Orders, which could only relate to that Prince. And therefore it was an irrational thing to deliberate to which of the two Sons they &s;hould offer the Crown, &s;ince only <HI>Hamzeh-Mirza</HI> was by Heaven pre&s;erved to be their Prince.</P>
<P>Thus was this Royal Infant about to have been advan|ced to the Throne to the Exclu&s;ion of his Elder Brother. All the <HI>Grandees</HI> gave their Con&s;ents for this Election, nor had one of the&s;e who had right to &s;peak denied him his voice. There were only two Eunuchs that had not &s;poke a word. And who would have thought they dur&s;t have pre&s;umed to have &s;poken a word? e&s;pecially the lea&s;t in Credit of the two? &s;eeing that neither the one or the other having neither Right, Title or Au|thority to &s;peak, could any one have imagined that they &s;hould have been &s;o bold to entertain Sentiments contrary to all the re&s;t of that Illu&s;trious Family? Or if they &s;hould have been &s;o
<PB N="19" REF="229">
daring, was there any likelyhood they &s;hould have the Confi|dence to declare them, and to carry it again&s;t &s;o many Voices?</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s it &s;o came to pa&s;s in a Manner that may be thought to be almo&s;t Miraculous, as well by rea&s;on of the Cir|cum&s;tances already ob&s;erved, as for tho&s;e which we are going about to ob&s;erve. Which a&s;&s;ures us that there is a Superior Pro|vidence which concerns it &s;elf in the Management of all human Affairs, commands all Events, and frequently brings things to pa&s;s contrary to all our Expectations, as here it hapned where <HI>Sephie</HI> was Elected notwith&s;tanding the confederacy of per&s;ons intere&s;&s;ed, and the favourable opportunities to advance their De&s;igns.</P>
<P>Now this &s;ame Eunuch that broke all the Mea&s;ures which the&s;e Lords had taken was <HI>Aga-Mubarek,</HI> in great Credit at Court, as we have already ob&s;erved, as being the per&s;on to whom the King had committed the Tuition of his &s;econd Son. He, I &s;ay, was Tutor to <HI>Hamzeh-Mirza</HI> whom the Grandees all endeavored to advance to the Throne, and whom it therefore behoved rather than any other to &s;upport and encourage their Suffrages, &s;ince that in all likelyhood the Grandeur of his Illu&s;trious Pupil would be a means infinitely to advance his Reputation, and pre&s;ent him a Fortune the mo&s;t glorious that a per&s;on of his Condition could hope for.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s the love of Ju&s;tice prevailed over all other Temp|tations that could affect his Soul; &s;o that it was not without a noble Indignation that he heard the Propo&s;al of the fir&s;t Mini&s;ter, to pre|fer the Younger before the Elder Brother, which augmented &s;o much the more by how much he found the Lords of the Coun|cil &s;o readily inclined to a Conde&s;cen&s;ion. Thereupon he took a Re&s;olution worthy that Ancient and Con&s;tant Fidelity which the <HI>Eunuchs</HI> have already gloried in. He thought it his Duty to prevent &s;uch a di&s;order and confu&s;ion as much as in him lay, and that tho he had no right to &s;peak in that A&s;&s;embly, yet that it was lawful for him for once to violate a Cu&s;tom which was no more than a bare Ceremony, to the end he might reduce into the right way, tho&s;e that went about to break that Love which Nature &s;eemed to have e&s;tabli&s;hed, and which Religion favoured.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s he &s;taid till every one had &s;poken in their turns, as well in re&s;pect to the Lords &s;o much his &s;uperiors, as for that he &s;till was in hopes that &s;ome one of better judgment, or at lea&s;t of better Principles &s;hould deliver his Opinion more ju&s;tly and according to Law, and deliver him out of that perplexity wherein &s;uch a trouble|&s;om Accident would engage him. But when he &s;aw that they had all
<PB N="20" REF="230">
with one Con&s;ent concluded to Elect the Younger Brother to the prejudice of the Elde&s;t, under pretences, which how &s;pecious &s;oever, they &s;eemed to be, were only the per&s;ua&s;ions of Intere&s;t, and upon Conjectures too weak at the bottom to gain credit in &s;uch an important Affair, with a fearle&s;s, yet re&s;pectful beha|viour he thus began:</P>
<P><Q>The Propo&s;al, Princes, and Lords of Lords, which you have made to exclude from the Crown <HI>Sephie,</HI> the Elde&s;t Son of <HI>Habas</HI> the <HI>Second,</HI> to whom it appertains by Law, and to advance in his room <HI>Hamzeh-Mirza,</HI> is an affront to Ju&s;tice and the Laws of the Elect <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> too vi&s;ible to believe you have &s;uffered your &s;elves to be &s;wayed to &s;uch a de&s;ign any otherwi&s;e than by &s;ome dazling Appearances as have &s;ur|prized your Judgments. For I dare be confident that not one among you all does think the Motives that have been alledged &s;ufficient. No&mdash;the Pretence which you have borrowed for the Election of <HI>Hamzeh-Mirza</HI> is not rational. The true Rea&s;on that prevails in your Minds, if I may be &s;o bold to tell you, tho you know it as well as my &s;elf, is your de&s;ire to govern <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> for many years to come, and at your own plea&s;ure. It is therefore that you would elect an Infant, under who&s;e Minority you may be able with permi&s;&s;i|on to exerci&s;e an ab&s;olute Authority. For what is alledged of the Elde&s;t Prince, that without doubt he is either deprived of his Life, or of his Sight, can be look'd upon only as a delu&s;ion. For had it been &s;o, &s;hould I have heard nothing of it? I that ever &s;ince the Kings departure from the Capital City have always been exactly acquainted with whatever pa&s;&s;ed in the Womens Palace; I that have always been a con|&s;tant Attendant in it; and more than that have had the Go|vernment of the Young Prince? If the Eunuch, who was &s;ent Po&s;t &s;ometime &s;ince to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> had private Orders to the ruine of <HI>Sephie-Mirza</HI> out of a de&s;ign to render him incapable of the Succe&s;&s;ion, &s;hould I have di&s;covered nothing? Or would not the decea&s;ed King have made &s;ome alterations in the condition of his &s;econd Son, for whom he had de&s;igned the Imperial Throne after his death? Would he not have en|larged his Revenue, and augmented the Splendour of his Court? Would he have concealed it from me, and <HI>the Light of Women,</HI> the Lady Mother of the Young Prince? Or if he had concealed it from me, would it not have been more ea&s;ie for me than for you to have di&s;covered &s;omething? &s;ince I have always lived in the Inner Palace, and that I knew every thing
<PB N="21" REF="230">
that pa&s;&s;ed there under the greate&s;t Secre&s;ie; whereas you are &s;o far from entring into it, that you can only look upon the out&s;ide of it. In a word, there is nothing in all that which you pretend to fear, <HI>Sephie-Mirza</HI> lives and &s;ees, my life for yours, God is my caution; and if it be not &s;o, here is my head. You cannot therefore without great Inju&s;tice, or rather foul Trea&s;on, forget the Elde&s;t, and &s;acrifice him to your own Pa&s;&s;ions, and the Intere&s;ts of his Younger Brother. Ra|ther let the Younger Brother be &s;acrificed to Him and the Intere&s;ts of the Kingdom. Do you not fore&s;ee how you are going about to throw the Kingdom into a di&s;mal Con|fu&s;ion, and fill it with Divi&s;ion? Think you the re&s;t of the Grandees will &s;uffer them&s;elves to be accounted Per&s;ons with|out Law, and approve your Votes? Think you the People will take your Crimes upon their &s;houlders, and endure the Younger Brother &s;itting upon the Throne of the <HI>Faithful,</HI> whom you could not place there till you had trampled under foot the mo&s;t Sacred Duties with which Religion in&s;pires us? On the other &s;ide, all the World will ri&s;e again&s;t you, to take part with the Lawful Heir; or if that &s;hould not come to pa&s;s, you will be laden with Cur&s;es, and looked upon as the Authors of a mo&s;t Execrable A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination: You will blu&s;h for &s;hame all your Lives, and live with perpetual torment in your brea&s;ts. <HI>Hamzeh-Mirza</HI> al&s;o him&s;elf, for whom you have pro&s;tituted your Con&s;ciences, will not he reward you for it one day? He will look upon you as Dogs that ad|vanced him to his Honour only for the Hounds fees; and as &s;uch who in hopes to fatten your &s;elves during his Mi|nority, for&s;ook God, the Law, the Prophet, the Book, the Explanation, Right Rea&s;on, and Ju&s;tice. I am &s;ure his Judgments will pur&s;ue you, and that the lea&s;t puni&s;hment you can expect will be to be &s;ent naked into &s;ome De&s;ert, there to thank God for only &s;aving your Lives.</Q></P>
<P>There he &s;topt of a &s;udden with &s;ome di&s;turbance in his Countenance: but immediately proceeds with a &s;udden Ex|clamation:</P>
<P><Q><HI>Hamzeh Mirza,</HI> cried he, <HI>Hamzeh Mirza,</HI> to what an extremity do you reduce him? Would you, my Lords, that I &s;hould go and &s;trangle him with my own hands, and that I &s;hould bring him dead into your pre&s;ence? I have the power, he is under my charge. By that means I &s;hall be able to prevent you from making an ill Choice: You &s;hall then be con&s;trained to carry the Crown to the Elde&s;t; and then I leave you to
<PB N="22" REF="231">
con&s;ider how he will receive it at your hands, when he &s;hall find that nothing could reduce you to your Allegiance but &s;uch a fatal extremity.</Q></P>
<P>With this threatning Language he concluded his Speech; leaving the Lords of the A&s;&s;embly &s;o &s;urprized that if a Moun|tain had fallen at their feet, as they &s;ay in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> they could not have been more a&s;toni&s;hed. They could not divine the rea&s;on that &s;hould induce the Eunuch to &s;uch a determined Re&s;olution: He was neither in&s;tigated by Hatred, Fear, nor Hope. Not by Hatred, becau&s;e they knew he tenderly fo&s;tered his lovely Pupil. Much le&s;s by Fear, &s;ince he could expect nothing but a &s;oft Indulgence in re&s;pect of him&s;elf from the Per&s;on that had been bred up in his Arms. Nor could he hope for any of tho&s;e advantages from the Elde&s;t, who&s;e di&s;po&s;ition he was not well acquainted with; for tho he might have a kindne&s;s for him, it could never be &s;o great as that of the younger Brother, who had &s;uck'd it in with his Milk. Therefore they all found that he &s;poke again&s;t his own Intere&s;ts, and that it could be nothing el&s;e but his zeal for Ju&s;tice and the Welfare of the Empire, his de&s;ire to &s;atisfie the People, and his Loyalty toward his de|cea&s;ed Ma&s;ter, that cau&s;ed him to act in that manner. However it encrea&s;ed their re&s;pect for him, and obliged them to admire his Sentiments &s;o generous, tho contrary to their Intentions, and &s;uch as altogether di&s;approved their Conduct.</P>
<P>It was about half a quarter of an Hour before any one of the A&s;&s;embly dur&s;t &s;o much as open their Lips; but &s;till they &s;ate looking one upon another, without &s;peaking a word, per|plexed between the &s;hame of recanting, and the fear of the danger which they ran, &s;hould they adventure ob&s;tinately to defend their fir&s;t Re&s;olutions. At length the chief Mini&s;ter, whether it were that he was more a friend to Ju&s;tice than the re&s;t, as there was rea&s;on to conjecture from his wonted noble and unbya&s;&s;ed manner of proceeding, or whether he feared le&s;t any other &s;hould &s;peak before him, which had rendered him guilty, in regard it was his Place to &s;peak fir&s;t, as he had al|ready done when he argued &s;o &s;tifly again&s;t <HI>Sephie Mirza.</HI> How|ever it were, the Prime Mini&s;ter fir&s;t breaking &s;ilence thus be|gan: <Q>That true it was, that if the A&s;&s;embly were infallibly a&s;&s;ured that the Elde&s;t Son of <HI>Habas</HI> II. was no longer in a condition to receive the Crown, they might ju&s;tifie the Election of the &s;econd Son; but &s;ince <HI>Aga Mubarek</HI> &s;o confi|dently a&s;&s;erted, that <HI>Sephie Mirza</HI> had neither lo&s;t his life, nor his &s;ight, they ought to choo&s;e him without any further
<PB N="23" REF="231">
deliberation: And therefore from the bottom of his heart he gave him both his Voice and all his choice&s;t Wi&s;hes, pro|te&s;ting that it was their duty forthwith to go and offer him the Diadem and the Empire.</Q></P>
<P>Upon tho&s;e words all the re&s;t of the Lords grew faint-hearted, and had no longer power to defend the Inju&s;tice which they had began. For the condition of the&s;e Lords renders them naturally fearful, who as illu&s;trious, and as great Princes as they &s;eem to be, are in effect but &s;o many Slaves; their Lives, their Liberty, their Honour, their E&s;tates ab&s;olutely depending upon the Plea&s;ure of the Sovereign; So that they were &s;o far from per&s;i&s;ting in their fir&s;t Opinions, that they &s;trove which &s;hould be the fir&s;t that &s;hould renounce what they had done; and di&s;&s;embling their Di&s;contents, they all unanimou&s;ly de|creed, <Q>That &s;ince the Elde&s;t Son was in a condition to enjoy the Crown, which legally appertained to him, that it was their duty without delay to fetch him from the Palace of Grandeur, and accompany him to the Throne.</Q></P>
<P>And thus was <HI>Sephie-Mirza</HI> elected Monarch of the Per&s;ians contrary to the Intention of tho&s;e them&s;elves that gave their Voices for him.</P>
<P>The Prime Mini&s;ter added, that after &s;o unfortunate an Election of the King, they were immediately to proceed to a &s;econd, which was the Nomination of a Per&s;on among the great Lords of the Kingdom, who was to po&s;t with all &s;peed to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> to fetch the Prince out of the Palace where he was enclo&s;ed, and &s;eat him in his Throne with all the accu&s;tomed Ceremonies, and to cau&s;e him to be acknowledged Sovereign Lord of the Per&s;ian Empire.</P>
<P>Now though this Election were not of equal Importance with the Election of the Prince, yet did it not occa&s;ion a lit|tle trouble among the Lords; who had no &s;incere and real Amity one for another, after the manner of Courtiers: for every one had their particular de&s;igns, and had an eye upon his Companion. However the Per&s;on to be nominated was to be taken out of their Number, becau&s;e there was not any of higher Quality than they were then at Court; and they that were of Inferiour Rank could not pretend to that Honour. But then again, believing that the Per&s;on, who &s;hould happen to be entru&s;ted with &s;uch a weighty Errand, would in all proba|bility gain a great A&s;cendant over the young Monarch's favour, who to recompence the welcome Tidings of &s;uch a Me&s;&s;enger, would afford him a large &s;hare of his Affections, their bu&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="24" REF="232">
was to ca&s;t their Eyes upon &s;ome One who&s;e good nature and generous temper they might be&s;t di&s;pence with; if they could not find out one of ab&s;olute Probity, and Sincerity. For what will not Vice attempt, when furni&s;hed with &s;uch great advantages? Or what Impre&s;&s;ions will not an evil per&s;on &s;tamp upon a Soul, if I may &s;o &s;ay, altogether rare, or on a Prince who&s;e tender Years will not permit him a due experience in the Affairs of the World?</P>
<P>So that every one of the Lords took care to nominate out of their number &s;uch a one as they thought would do lea&s;t mi&s;chief, who if he had not a Will to do them good, &s;hould have as little de&s;ire to do them harm. As for the Prime Mini&s;ter, and the <HI>Superintendant,</HI> who for their high Dignity had mo&s;t right to the honour of &s;uch an important Deputation could not be &s;pared, becau&s;e at that juncture of time their Pre&s;ence was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary at Court. The Prime Mini&s;ter was to &s;tay for the di&s;patch of Bu&s;ine&s;s, and to give Audiences upon Affairs of State, and by his Pre&s;ence to prevent any Di&s;turbance that might ari&s;e upon the news of <HI>Habas</HI>'s Death, if by any Accident it &s;hould happen to be divulged before the time; which would &s;oon have come to light by the ab&s;ence of the Prime Mini&s;ter, who never &s;tirs from the Prince's Elbow, if the King be alive. Nor was it more po&s;&s;ible for the Superintendant to &s;tir, as well for the &s;ame rea&s;on, as for that He, having the &s;ole ordering of all the rich Furniture and Trea&s;ures of the King's Hou&s;e, and of all the Convoys and Waggons every day going and coming to the Court with Provi&s;ions and other Nece&s;&s;aries, cannot leave his Employment, for fear any Di&s;order or Confu&s;ion &s;hould happen.</P>
<P>Then again, becau&s;e it was &s;till convenient that the People &s;hould know no more but that the King was &s;ick, that was it which prevented the Grand Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;hold from being &s;ent; in regard his Office, like tho&s;e of the two former, obliges him to be always near the King. The chief A&s;trologer, and the chief Phy&s;ician were not of Quality &s;ufficient to a&s;pire to that Honour, and much le&s;s the Two Eunuchs. In|deed the Dignity of the Grand E&s;quire, and Grand Hunt&s;man might in &s;ome mea&s;ure have claimed it. But in regard they are not properly Officers of the Kingdom, but rather the Kings Officers; they began to ca&s;t their lies upon the Generals of the Army, the <HI>General of the Slaves,</HI> and the <HI>General of the Mu&s;quet|teers,</HI> chiefly becau&s;e they are &s;uperiour in Dignity to the two latter, and for that their Employments do not tye them to be
<PB N="25" REF="232">
at Court; True it is, they were not very grateful to the Lords; but for once as before there was a nece&s;&s;ity that Inclination and Affection mu&s;t give way to Duty.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e two Competitors, the General of the Slaves ex|pected the Precedency as his due, in regard his Employment gave him the Preheminency; which he could not di&s;&s;emble, but di&s;played his hopes and expectations in his very Counte|nance. However he mi&s;&s;ed of his reckoning: for he had not one Friend in the whole A&s;&s;embly; they knew him too well, to be a crafty Knave of a turbulent &s;pirit, and of a mi&s;chievous humour; and therefore they were all afraid if he &s;pake fir&s;t to the new King, he would not forget his old tricks, but would form &s;uch Contrivances at lea&s;t again&s;t the greate&s;t part of them, that they &s;hould not ea&s;ily di&s;intangle them&s;elves. Upon which con&s;iderations they gave their Voices unanimou&s;ly for the Ge|neral of the Mu&s;quetteers. Not but that they had &s;ome appre|hen&s;ions of him likewi&s;e, as not having altogetheer the Repu|tation of a &s;incere man, only he was a Saint in compari&s;on of the other. For his Cunning did not carry him to the full ex|tent of Malice. Be&s;ides that he was looked upon as a Per|&s;on of great Parts, and one that under&s;tood the Court, and the Intere&s;ts of the Neighbouring Princes. For which Rea&s;on he had been &s;ent for &s;ome Years before in the Quality of an Emba&s;&s;adour to the pre&s;ent King of the <HI>Indies Aurang-Zeb,</HI> to congratulate his coming to the Crown; and had behaved him|&s;elf with &s;o much Grandeur in the Emba&s;&s;ie, that his Ma&s;ter gave him &s;ignal Te&s;timonies of his Satisfaction. And indeed his <HI>Rodomantadoes</HI> in that Court are &s;trangely remarkable, &s;uch as the Reader will hardly credit, when I &s;hall publi&s;h what I have collected in reference to that Emba&s;&s;ie.</P>
<P>This Lord, then, being thus deputed, the A&s;&s;embly gave order about &s;ome other things that concerned his journey, and how they &s;hould manage Affairs at Court in expectation of the New King.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, It was ordered that Eleven Per&s;ons &s;hould accompany the Commi&s;&s;ioner to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> that is to &s;ay, two A&s;trologers, the <HI>Munchiziim-Bachi,</HI> or the Chief of tho&s;e that profe&s;s that Science, who was called <HI>Mirza-Baker,</HI> and with him another A&s;trologer, one of the mo&s;t noted in the Kingdom, who&s;e Name was <HI>Mahamed-Saleh.</HI> They were to be pre&s;ent at the Coronation, with an A&s;trolabe in their hands, to take the for|tunate hour, as they term it in the Per&s;ian Language, and ob|&s;erve the lucky Moments that a happy Con&s;tellation &s;hould
<PB N="26" REF="233">
point out for Proceedings of that Importance. To the&s;e they added four of the Principal Officers employed in the cu&s;tody of the Trea&s;ure to carry and take care of what Jewels &s;hould be requi&s;ite for the Ceremony. The other five were not then nominated, in regard that every one of the Principal Officers of State had a right to appoint his own Deputy upon that Oc|ca&s;ion.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e five Commi&s;&s;ioners, who are always Per&s;ons of Qua|lity, were in their Ma&s;ters names to throw them&s;elves at the feet of the new Monarch, &s;o &s;oon as he &s;hould be brought forth of the private Apartment of the Palace, and at the Ce|remony of the Coronation to repre&s;ent the Per&s;on by whom they were deputed. Of which the one was the <HI>Prime Mini&s;ter;</HI> the other the <HI>Grand Superintendant;</HI> the third, the <HI>General of the Slaves;</HI> the fourth, the <HI>Lord Chief Ju&s;tice;</HI> and the fifth, the <HI>Principal Secretary of State.</HI></P>
<P>In the &s;econd place it was ordered by the Lords, that the <HI>General of the Mu&s;quetteers,</HI> with his Eleven Attendants, &s;hould &s;et forward the next Morning before day, unle&s;s the Grand <HI>A&s;trologer</HI> &s;hould find the Con&s;titution of the Heavens and the A&s;pects of the Planets not to be favourable; whereupon they &s;hould forbear till a more lucky &s;ea&s;on. That then every one &s;hould depart, and &s;tay at a New <HI>Caravan-Seray,</HI> which is four Leagues from <HI>Demagaan,</HI> till the Twelve Per&s;ons being all arrived, they might proceed altogether in their Journey. And that for fear le&s;t if they &s;hould depart in Company from the Camp Royal, they &s;hould create too great a jealou&s;ie of the cau&s;e of their Journey.</P>
<P>In the third place the Lords ordained that the General of the Mu&s;quetteers &s;hould carry a Letter to his Maje&s;ty in the name of the whole A&s;&s;embly, which &s;hould be read in their hearing, be|fore it was put into his hands, that nothing might be in&s;erted but what was approved by all.</P>
<P>In the fourth place they unanimou&s;ly agreed, for the bet|ter concealing the Kings Death, that every one &s;hould Offi|ciate in their &s;everal Stations, as they did before the doleful Ac|cident hapned; and pay their accu&s;tomed Attendance about the Palace. That in the mean time they &s;hould amu&s;e the People with a belief that the King was only &s;ick, and in a fair way of recovery. That the Eunuchs there pre&s;ent, and others con|cerned, &s;hould endeavour to keep all things private in the Wo|mens Palace, and u&s;e their utmo&s;t diligence to chear and com|fort up the Women, for fear their loud Complaints and Moans &s;hould be heard by tho&s;e without.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="233">
In the fifth place it was ordered that the Eunuchs with the chief Phy&s;icians &s;hould take care to embalm the Body of the decea&s;ed King, to the end he might afterwards be put into a Leaden Coffin according to Cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, The &s;ame Lords ordained that at the end of Eight Days all the Court &s;hould depart from the Village of <HI>Ko&s;roes-Abaad</HI> where then it was; and in regard it was impo&s;&s;ible in &s;o great a Hurry to travel far in a day, that they would make &s;hort Journeys to <HI>Kachaan;</HI> that they &s;hould order their March ac|cording to the Sea&s;on, and as they thought mo&s;t proper, to prevent all occa&s;ions that might give the People any rea&s;on too curiou&s;ly to pry into the condition of the Kings Per|&s;on.</P>
<P>Toward Evening the Letter which was to be pre&s;ented to the New Monarch was delivered to the <HI>General of the Slaves.</HI> It was put up in a Pur&s;e of Cloth of Gold, drawn together with &s;trings of twi&s;ted Gold and Silk, with Ta&s;&s;els of the &s;ame, and &s;o knit into a Knot. It was &s;ealed with &s;oft Wax; upon which the Chief Mini&s;ter put his own Seal. Nor was any omitted of all tho&s;e Knacks and Curio&s;ities which the Oriental People make u&s;e of in making up their Epi&s;tles.</P>
<P>By this Letter, of which I was very careful to get a Copy, drawn from the Original, the Lords gave <HI>His mo&s;t Excellent Maje&s;ty</HI> to under&s;tand, <Q>How the Great Potentate and Ruler who&s;e place is in Paradi&s;e, King <HI>Habas</HI> II. who&s;e bright|&s;hining Glory God increa&s;e, departed this Life the twenty &s;ixth of the Moon called <HI>Rabeya-el-e&s;any,</HI> at the beginning of the <HI>Return (that is, of the Return of her Light)</HI> without having made any Will, or given any Order touching his Succe&s;&s;our, or nominated any Per&s;on to Govern the King|dom.</Q></P>
<P><Q>That as &s;oon as they had notice of the Di&s;mal Accident, they a&s;&s;embled together to con&s;ider who the Per&s;on was whom Heaven had Elected to &s;ucceed the King. Whereupon with an unanimous con&s;ent they had as &s;oon named Him, and cau&s;ed his mo&s;t Excellent Per&s;on to be acknowledged Lord of Kingdoms of va&s;t Extent, and only capable to &s;up|ply the Throne of the Immortal Succe&s;&s;ion of Prince of the World. Upon which they had put up their mo&s;t ardent Prayers, that God would be plea&s;ed to &s;urround him with Glory, and to prepare for him Triumphs worthy the high Honour to which he had called him, Prote&s;ting at his Feet, that they were his mo&s;t humble and mo&s;t obedient Slaves.
<PB N="28" REF="234">
That to e&s;tabli&s;h his mo&s;t Magnificent and mo&s;t Glorious Per&s;on in the Throne which re&s;embled the Cele&s;tial, they had deputed one of their Members, the <HI>General of the Mu&s;|quetteers</HI> to deliver him their mo&s;t humble and mi&s;erable Letter; who was accompanied with &s;everal other Per&s;ons elected to expre&s;s by word of mouth in the name of the whole A&s;&s;embly their Submi&s;&s;ions and Va&s;&s;alage, and then to &s;upply the places of the mo&s;t humble Slaves of the Throne, which is the true Seat of the <HI>Kalibat,</HI> (or <HI>Pontificate)</HI> in the great Solemnity of his Coronation, to be performed by the Impo&s;ition of the Sacred <HI>Imamic Tiara</HI> (or <HI>Prophetick Tiara.)</HI> That the Body of his thrice Illu&s;trious Father, who&s;e place is in Paradi&s;e, who&s;e bright &s;hining Glory God encrea&s;e, &s;hould be conducted to the City of <HI>Kachaan;</HI> and that with the re&s;t of the Court, they who had taken the boldne&s;s to write the&s;e Pre&s;ents would expect the mo&s;t firm Orders which his Maje&s;ty would be plea&s;ed to &s;end them; as well for the Place of his Burial, and for &s;uch other Duties to which their Va&s;&s;alage of indi&s;pen&s;able nece&s;&s;ity engaged them.</Q></P>
<P>This was the &s;ub&s;tance of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Letter, of which we have expre&s;&s;ed the Stile, and imitated the Strain as near as our Language would permit. Moreover upon the Back and the lowermo&s;t Fold was &s;et the Seal of the Prime Mini&s;ter according to Cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>The next day the General of the Mu&s;quetteers, and the other Eleven Per&s;ons departed, and made all the ha&s;t that po&s;&s;ibly they could: Yet not &s;o fa&s;t as they could have de&s;ired, or as Occa&s;ions of that nature required. For con&s;idering the va&s;t number that rode Po&s;t altogether, it was not to be expected they &s;hould meet with change of Hor&s;es; be&s;ide the danger of breaking or endamaging the Jewels by a violent Motion, was a thing which the Officers of the Trea&s;ury were much affraid of. Thus they travel the hundred and twelve Per&s;ian Leagues (which make a hundred and forty French) between <HI>Ko&s;roes|abaad</HI> and <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> where they arrived the &s;eventh day after they &s;et out, upon a Saturday. Which was the third of the Moon, called <HI>Gumadi-el-avel,</HI> which an&s;wers to our &s;econd of <HI>October,</HI> according to the Computation known among us; about &s;even of the Clock in the Evening; at what time the Mer|chants and Trade&s;men in the <HI>Bazars</HI> and <HI>Piazzas</HI> &s;hut up their Shops, and every body goes to his own home.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="234">
Some per&s;ons of Quality ob&s;erving this numerous Troop that came Po&s;t, and knowing the general of the Slaves at the head of them, and the re&s;t of the Commons which they had &s;een at Court, believed that they rode before, and were come to pre|pare all things ready in the Kings Palace by his Order for the Reception of his Maje&s;ty, who&s;e Return that City had long expected with great impatience. Thereupon they enquired of the General as he pa&s;&s;ed by, and of &s;everal others that followed him; who made an&s;wer, that his Maje&s;ty was at hand and in a little time would appear in the City. Which equivocation was true, and yet concealed the Secret which he had in Charge.</P>
<P>This numerous Train of Lords being arrived in the great Square before the Royal Palace, alighted with all their Retinue at the principal Gate of that Magnificent Pile, which they call <HI>Hali-Kapi</HI> or <HI>Haly's Gate,</HI> or by another interpretation, the <HI>High-Gate.</HI></P>
<P>There they all Stopped except the <HI>General of the Slaves</HI> and the Prime Mini&s;ters Deputy. For they too as &s;oon as they were alighted, went directly to the &s;econd Gate oppo&s;ite in a direct line at &s;ome di&s;tance to the other, as we &s;hall &s;hew in our Di&s;|cription of <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> which &s;econd Gate is the Principal Gate of the Womens Apartment, and is called the <HI>Sacred Gate.</HI></P>
<P>Through that Gate it was that tho&s;e two Lords went to the fir&s;t Apartment without, appointed for the White Eunuchs. <HI>Eunuchs</HI> which in truth are po&s;ted there to Guard the Place where the Women are inclo&s;ed, but never enter into it, but upon &s;ome extraordinary and urgent Occa&s;ion. There the general of the Mu&s;quetteers made known his Quality to the White Eunuch who came to receive him, and de&s;ired to go, and de&s;ire the <HI>Aga Nazir,</HI> that he would be plea&s;ed to come forth with &s;peed, for his bu&s;ine&s;s would admit of no delay. We have already ob|&s;erved that this <HI>Aga-Nazir</HI> had been entru&s;ted by the Decea&s;ed King, in his Life time, with the Guardian&s;hip of <HI>Sephie-Mirza,</HI> afterwards Elected Monarch, and with the general Over&s;ight of the Womens Palace; which obliged him to take all the care ima|ginable of this Apartment, which is as it were a <HI>Corps du Guard,</HI> where the White Eunuchs are lodged that watch the entrance into the Womens Apartment. However he hath a Magnifi|cent Palace in the City; but then he hapned to be attending on his Duty in the Palace.</P>
<P>He therefore under&s;tanding that a Lord of that high Quality de&s;ired to &s;peak with him, pre&s;ently went forth to know what Commands he brought. So &s;oon as he appeared, the General
<PB N="30" REF="235">
Mu&s;quetteers advanced alone to meet him, while the Prime Mi|ni&s;ters Deputy out of re&s;pect kept a di&s;tance behind.</P>
<P>The General having drawn the Eunuch a&s;ide whi&s;pered &s;ome words in his Ear, which were never known what they were, or at lea&s;t I could never certainly learn what they were. Some affirm that he di&s;covered to him the Death of <HI>Habas,</HI> and the Election of the Elde&s;t Son of that Monarch, who&s;e Governour that Eunuch was. Which he was forced to do, becau&s;e he had no Orders in writing from the King, nor could have, in regard he was Dead. And yet this is always ob&s;erved, when any Grandee, di&s;patched from the Court, demands any per&s;on within to be let out, he &s;hews his Command to the Governour of the Place. Others alledge that he &s;aid nothing to him of that weighty Affair, for that it would have co&s;t him his Head, had he declared it to any other before he had declared it to the King. However it were, if he did make any di&s;covery, it was in few words. For immediately tho&s;e two Lords, the General of the Mu&s;quetteers and the <HI>Seeing Eunuch,</HI> went forward to the other more remote Apartment, which joyns immediately to the la&s;t Entrance into the Apartment.</P>
<P>When they came to that Apartment where lie the Black Eunuchs, who have Liberty to go up and down the inner Hou&s;e where the Women are lodged, one of the Chief among them under&s;tanding the <HI>Aga Nazir</HI> was come forth to under&s;tand what he de&s;ired: the other de&s;ired him to go immediately to <HI>Sephie-Mirza</HI> and to let him know that the <HI>Me&s;&s;enger of the mo&s;t Sublime Command and of the mo&s;t Potent Order</HI> &s;taid at the Door, and had &s;omething to communicate to him of the highe&s;t Importance, and which was for his Advantage. And there|fore, that he would be plea&s;ed to come forth and &s;peak with him.</P>
<P>Which words the White Eunuch delivered to the Black Eunuch in &s;uch a Tone, and with &s;uch a Countenance as di&s;co|vered nothing either of Sadne&s;s or Joy, from whence he could make any Conjectures either of bad or good Fortune. For con&s;idering the &s;ecrecy of the Affair he came about, it be|hoved him to affect a kind of Indifferency. So that the Black Eunuch reported back the Me&s;&s;age to the Young Prince as he had received it, who at that time was with the Prince&s;s his Mother.</P>
<P>I &s;hall rather chu&s;e to give the Reader leave to imagin what was the A&s;toni&s;hment that &s;eized tho&s;e two Royal Per&s;ons at the &s;uddenne&s;s of the News, and whence they had rea&s;on to
<PB N="31" REF="235">
gather a thou&s;and &s;u&s;picions and jealou&s;ies, than go about to ex|pre&s;s it in words. We learnt afterwards, that for &s;ome time they &s;tood like Statues in a profound &s;ilence, which was fir&s;t in|terrupted by a loud &s;hriek of the Prince&s;s, and afterwards by the&s;e words, which brake forth through the mid&s;t of her &s;ighs while &s;he embraced the Prince, <HI>Ah my dear Son, there's an end of thy Life.</HI></P>
<P>And indeed &s;he could not look for any other thing for him than Death, or &s;ome other Misfortune little le&s;s terrible. She much le&s;s dreamt that it was to advance him to the Throne. For in two Years that &s;he had taken leave of her Husband, then healthy and vigorous, in the Flower of his Age, not exceeding thirty &s;ix Years, &s;he had never heard of his being &s;ick, much le&s;s could &s;he believe him dead.</P>
<P>Therefore when &s;he heard that a <HI>Noble Me&s;&s;enger of the High Order</HI> was come to &s;peak with the Prince, what could &s;he think but that this Order came from <HI>Habas</HI> the Second; and that his Command was either to put to death, or pluck out her Sons Eyes; and that if they pre&s;&s;ed him &s;o earne&s;tly to come forth, it was only to under&s;tand and &s;uffer the Execution of that Order. All Appearances confirmed this &s;ad Su&s;picion. The &s;everity of the Monarch was known to her, as well as the di&s;gu&s;t which he had taken again&s;t his Elde&s;t Son, of which he had given &s;uch publick proofs by the &s;trict Captivity to which he had confined him. But &s;he that mo&s;t perplexed her, and augmented her mi&s;tru&s;ts, was the Lady-Mother of <HI>Hamzeh-Mirza,</HI> Que&s;tionle&s;s, &s;aid &s;he, <Q>that wicked Woman it is, who by her Care&s;&s;es and alluring Charms has over-ruled the King, to deprive my Son of the Crown, to &s;et it upon hers.</Q> Thereupon &s;he began to redouble her Shrieks and Lamentations in &s;uch a manner, that the whole Palace rang with her Com|plaints. All the Ladies &s;urprized to hear the fir&s;t of the Kings Legitimate Wives in &s;uch an Agony, ran pre&s;ently to condole her &s;orrows, and to intermix their Tears and Complaints with hers. And indeed they had rea&s;on, e&s;pecially the Confidents of the Young Prince, who had an extraordinary Pa&s;&s;ion for his Intere&s;ts. Friend&s;hip in others produced the &s;ame Effects, be|lieving bloudy Executioners were come to ravi&s;h from their Arms a Friendly Prince in his tender Years. So that it is &s;aid that the Women rai&s;ed &s;uch a general Compa&s;&s;ion, that even the Black Eunuch who was pre&s;ent, tho they are a &s;ort of Peo|ple endued with &s;avage and remor&s;ele&s;s Souls, could not refrain from dropping &s;ome few tears, and quitting that Indifferency to which his Tru&s;t and Duty obliged him.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="236">
The General of the Mu&s;quetteers and the <HI>Nazir Eunuch</HI> at the &s;ame time heard the Womens Lamentations, and believing it proceeded from the mi&s;take of the Mother of the Ladies that belonged to the Prince, &s;ent a &s;econd <HI>Black Enunch</HI> to a&s;&s;ure the Prince&s;s, that the Me&s;&s;enger who waited for the Prince her Son at the Gate had brought him happy tydings, and de&s;ired only to give him notice of a more Exalted Fortune. Which they both confirmed by an Oath mo&s;t &s;olemn among the Per&s;ians, by the Head of the <HI>Great Agrea,</HI> by whom they mean <HI>Haty,</HI> whom they believe to be the real Succe&s;&s;our to <HI>Mahomet.</HI> But all tho&s;e Oaths and Prote&s;tations did nothing avail but only to augment the Mi&s;tru&s;ts of the afflicted Mother. She redoubled her Lamentations more loudly than before; She hugged her beloved Son in her Arms, and in the Tran&s;ports of her &s;orrow called down a Thou&s;and Imprecations upon the decea&s;ed King her Husband, calling him <HI>Barbarian, Infidel, Impious, and the Fatal cau&s;e of all her Tears.</HI> Wherein &s;he &s;aid Truth, tho he were but a very Innocent Cau&s;e. Sometimes &s;he turned to|ward the Lordly Me&s;&s;enger, whom &s;he reproached with the &s;currilous Terms of <HI>Dog,</HI> and <HI>Me&s;&s;enger of Death;</HI> &s;ometimes toward the <HI>Eunuchs</HI> that were pre&s;ent, whom &s;he upbraided for <HI>Traytors.</HI></P>
<P>All the while the Young Prince &s;tood immovable; for, as is &s;aid, he uttered not one word; nor did he &s;hew in his Counte|nance any &s;ign of &s;orrow. It is very probable, that it was &s;o extreme, as to overwhelm him in &s;uch a &s;ort, that he had neither Life nor Motion. While Nature that could not find &s;ufficient &s;igns to expre&s;s her dreadful pains, &s;tood as it were en|tranced, not knowing what &s;ide to take. Therefore the Young Prince &s;hed not a Tear, becau&s;e the occa&s;ion which he had to weep was &s;o great: In that manner he &s;tood in the mid&s;t of the Lamentations of the Women, who detained him, and drew him to their knees, as if they had re&s;olved to defend him, and pre|vent tho&s;e that came to carry him away from approaching his Per&s;on.</P>
<P>This Scene had la&s;ted above three quarters of an Hour, for other Black Eunuchs that were &s;ent one after another with Oaths and new Imprecations to a&s;&s;ure them that the General brought Orders only that were highly to the Princes advantage, could gain nothing upon the belief of the Mother and the other Women, &s;o that the <HI>Nazir</HI> re&s;olved to go him&s;elf in per&s;on to try what he could do to undeceive her. But &s;o &s;oon as he appeared before the Mother, and with terrible Oaths endea|voured
<PB N="33" REF="236">
to a&s;&s;ure her that there was no danger, the Prince&s;s &s;till holding her Son clo&s;ely embraced in her Arms, cried out, And <HI>Thou Dog, art thou al&s;o a Me&s;&s;enger of Death like the re&s;t?</HI></P>
<P>The di&s;con&s;olate Prince&s;s was not to be comforted; for the more Me&s;&s;engers they &s;ent, the more Oaths they &s;wore, the le&s;s credit &s;he gave to their Imprecations. She looked upon them all as Artifices to &s;urprize her, and to induce her to con&s;ent that her Son &s;hould go forth where Death waited his coming. But at length &s;ome of the Principal Young Ladies &s;uffered them|&s;elves to be over-ruled by the per&s;ua&s;ions of the <HI>Aga,</HI> and the horrible Imprecations which he called down upon his head, that there was no danger in the world, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted him to bring forth the Prince; and yet with &s;ome kind of violence in forcing him from his Mothers Arms. Who being reduced to de&s;pair, &s;eeing &s;he could not re&s;i&s;t the re&s;pectful violence that was put upon her, and that &s;he could no longer hold the dear Pledge of her Life, &s;he flung from her Seat of a &s;udden, and after &s;he had &s;natched the Dagger out of the Sheath that hung at the Young Prince's &s;ide, pre&s;enting it to the Brea&s;t of the Chief Eunuch, who was next her, and had the Young Prince by the hand, <HI>Go,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>in the Name of God, but take a care what thou do&s;t, and what thou ha&s;t promi&s;ed. If he mu&s;t peri&s;h, know that thou thy &s;elf &s;halt fir&s;t &s;uffer the puni&s;hment which thy Lying and thy Trea&s;on de&s;erve.</HI> Pre&s;ently the Eunuch accepted the Condition, and con&s;ented to receive his death at her hands if any thing di&s;mal befel him. Which &s;omewhat pacified the Lady, &s;o that &s;he delivered the Poniard, and &s;uffered it to be &s;heathed again at her Sons &s;ide.</P>
<P>And then it was that the Eunuch redoubling the Oaths that he had &s;worn, and the A&s;&s;urances which he had already given her, that there was no danger, but on the contrary, a pro&s;pect of all Pro&s;perity, &s;atisfied tho&s;e Royal Per&s;ons, as much as it was po&s;&s;ible, in &s;uch a dubious Dilemma of their Anxious minds.</P>
<P>The Mother accompanied her Son as far as the la&s;t Place, where &s;he was permitted to go without being &s;een through the Gate that &s;tood open, and then returned with a &s;ad heart, &s;up|ported by &s;ome of her Women, and the Prince trembling and quivering was carried, as I may &s;o &s;ay, by the Chief Eunuch without the fir&s;t Portal, toward the Apartment of the black Eunuchs.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="237">
At the very In&s;tant that he appeared without, the General of the <HI>Mu&s;quetteers,</HI> with the Prime Mini&s;ters Deputy, who kept at a di&s;tance behind him, threw him&s;elf at the Prince's Feet, and made three Obey&s;ances according to Cu&s;tom, knocking the Ground with his Forehead. Then ri&s;ing upon his Knees, with his Cheeks all bathed in Tears, which either the Lamentations of the Ladies had drawn from his Eyes, or the Death of the Monarch, of which he brought the News, had made him &s;hed, he declared the occa&s;ion of his coming in the&s;e words, which he uttered with a loud voice, and very di&s;tinctly.</P>
<P><HI>May your Illu&s;trious Head be always &s;afe; The King of the World, your Father</HI> Habas, <HI>to whom the God of mercy grant a new accumulation of Glory has found a Place next to the Divine Goodne&s;s; and Your Illu&s;trious Highne&s;s is cho&s;en to &s;ucceed Him, and has been &s;tiled the Lieutenant of the true Sovereign.</HI> For that is the &s;ignifi|cation of the word <HI>Vali&egrave;-Neamet,</HI> which was made u&s;e of in that Expre&s;&s;ion, as being the mo&s;t u&s;ual Epithete, as al&s;o the mo&s;t &s;ublime, which the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> have been accu&s;tomed to give their Kings. For <HI>Vali&egrave;</HI> denotes a <HI>Sovereign Lieutenant;</HI> that is, an Ab&s;olute Prince in his Dominions, and yet one that depends and holds of another. It al&s;o &s;ignifies a Mediator almo&s;t in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e. Becau&s;e a Lieutenant of that nature is a Medi|ator between the Lord from whom he derives his Authority, and the People to whom he di&s;tributes both Puni&s;hments and Re|wards in the Name of the Sovereign Supreme. As for <HI>Neamet,</HI> it comes from the word <HI>Inaam,</HI> which &s;ignifies the free Gift of a Lord to his Slave. So that by the Compound <HI>Vali&egrave;-Neamet,</HI> the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> under&s;tand a Lieutenant, whom the true and &s;upreme Sovereign, who is God, has e&s;tabli&s;hed with ab&s;olute Autho|rity to di&s;pence over all the World in his &s;tead his Favour and Benefits, as we &s;hall more amply and more to the purpo&s;e ex|plain it in another place.</P>
<P>The <HI>General of the Mu&s;quetteers</HI> thought it not convenient to u&s;e more words, that he might not delay the Prince, whom he found to be impatient to hear what he had to &s;ay. But then from one extremity he fell into another quite contrary. To tho&s;e Tears that had for&s;aken him &s;ucceeded A&s;toni&s;hment, Joy and Sadne&s;s that overwhelmed him anew; and rendered him once again as motionle&s;s as before.</P>
<P>He became like a per&s;on who out of long Darkne&s;s comes of a &s;udden in a flaring Light. He &s;eemed to be &s;eized with a kind of dazling Amaze, and like one that did not &s;ee, beheld as in a Trance, the great number of Eunuchs that kneeled
<PB N="35" REF="237">
round about him, calling him their Lord and Sovereign. The&s;e fir&s;t Minutes being over, he appeared more compo&s;ed in his Countenance, and &s;oftly leaned upon the Chief Eunuch, like one that had been waked out of a profound &s;leep. He began to reflect upon what was pa&s;&s;ed, and he found that they were &s;o far from having any de&s;ign upon his Life, that they came to ad|vance him to the Throne. Neverthele&s;s, in regard he could not hear tho&s;e joyful tydings, but as they were accompanied with the News of his Fathers death, both unlookt for, the &s;urpri&s;e was equal on both &s;ides, and put him a third time into &s;uch an a&s;toni&s;hment that he &s;tood for &s;ome time in a kind of a Trance. This Grief for &s;ome Minutes conte&s;ted with his Joy, till at length his good nature overcame the latter. He obeyed the per&s;ua&s;ions of his &s;orrow; not minding what he had gained, but what he had lo&s;t: and in the mid&s;t of tho&s;e thoughts, over|powered by his Affliction, according to the Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> he tore his <HI>Cabaye,</HI> or upper Garment, from the Coller to the Wa&s;te. He wept biterly, not having &s;hed a tear till that time; tho the Lamentations of his Mother, and the Con&s;ter|nation wherein he had beheld all the Ladies of his Palace had given him &s;ufficient cau&s;e. This &s;hewed the good nature of the Young Monarch, as I have already &s;aid, for it cannot be ima|gined that he di&s;&s;embled in what he did. He was too young to under&s;tand the &s;ly tricks of craft and &s;ubtilty, and being one who had never &s;een the world, but had been bred up ten|derly among the Women; accu&s;tomed only to talk of fine Cloaths, and Baubles, and to command Eunuchs. Be&s;ides that, the di&s;order of his mind for above an Hour before would not permit him to ob&s;erve &s;uch a regular Conduct. So that although he had been ill u&s;ed by his Father, who had &s;hut him up in a clo&s;e Pri&s;on, and who&s;e Death &s;eemed to re&s;tore him to Life, by giving him his Liberty and a Diadem, he could not forbear to bewail his lo&s;s as an Evil that was never a whit the le&s;s for being the cau&s;e of &s;o much good. Rather mu&s;t it then be an effect of Nature, which &s;hews that &s;he is always the Mi&s;tris of our Affections, and that the Pa&s;&s;ions which &s;he in&s;pires will &s;till prevail, notwith&s;tanding all the Ob&s;tacles of Ambition, In|tere&s;t, or good Fortune.</P>
<P>The General of the Slaves beholding the Prince oppre&s;&s;ed with &s;o much grief, made no An&s;wer, &s;peaking only, as I may &s;o &s;ay, with his Eyes, from whence he let fall a &s;hower of Tears, and without expecting any longer till the Prince commanded him to ri&s;e, he ro&s;e of him&s;elf, and approaching his Maje&s;ty, made
<PB N="36" REF="238">
u&s;e of all his Eloquence to alleviate his &s;orrow. The <HI>Nazir</HI> Eunuch al&s;o was no le&s;s &s;edulous to joyn with him in com|forting the Young Prince, &s;o that by degrees the violence of his mourning began to abate. The lu&s;tre of a Diadem repre&s;ented it &s;elf before his Eyes with all its glory; &s;o that he &s;uffered him&s;elf to be overcome with the Charms of Grandeur, and the &s;plendour of an exalted Fortune that glittered in his &s;ight, according to the Expre&s;&s;ion in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Original.</P>
<P>Thereupon the two Lords looking &s;tedfa&s;tly one upon ano|ther, as it were making &s;igns to each other as to what they had already concluded among them&s;elves; and well knowing that as yet the Young Prince under&s;tood not how to act the King, they asked him, as it were by way of an indirect and glancing In&s;truction what he had to do, whether it were his Maje&s;ties plea&s;ure that they &s;hould attend him forthwith to the Palace Royal, to receive his Diadem, in regard it was of great im|portance that he &s;hould make no longer delay. To which the Prince conde&s;cended, and ordered them to do whatever in their judgment they deemed mo&s;t proper and convenient. Upon which the General of the Mu&s;quetteers, attended by the <HI>Chief Eunuch,</HI> with a great Train of other Per&s;ons, conducted the Prince to the Apartment where the Kings were accu&s;tomed to give Publick Audience, which they call <HI>Talaar, Tavieleh,</HI> where the Deputies of the Principal Officers of State, the <HI>Grand A&s;trologer,</HI> and the re&s;t that came from the Court were admitted to make their three u&s;ual Prote&s;tations in his Pre&s;ence, the Deputies in the Name of their Ma&s;ters, the re&s;t for them&s;elves. After that, his Maje&s;ty went into a Bath which was near the Apartment, there to purifie him&s;elf, as the Law ordains, and to array him&s;elf in new Habits, while all things were preparing for the Coronation with all diligence.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Chief of the A&s;trologers, with his Companion that came along with him from the Court, re|tiring to their proper Station, &s;et them&s;elves to ob&s;erve the Lucky Hour according to the Po&s;ition of the Stars for the performance of this weighty Ceremony. Thus all things were got ready in le&s;s than an hour and a half, through the great diligence as well of the General of the Mu&s;quetteers, as of the <HI>Nazir</HI> Eunuch, who from the very moment that they arrived at the Ladies Palace, and during the time that the King &s;taid in the Bath, had privately &s;ent with all
<PB N="37" REF="238">
&s;peed for the Furniture of Per&s;ons nece&s;&s;ary for the So|lemnity.</P>
<P>Which before I declare at large, I am induced to think it will not be ami&s;s to make a de&s;cription of the place where it was performed. And this I &s;hall borrow from an|other Treati&s;e of my own, wherein I have given a full ac|compt of the Capital City of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and what is in it mo&s;t worthy ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Toward the North, very near the Walls of the Palace, over again&s;t one of the Gates that lead to the principal Entry, is an ancient Apartment, built in a perfect Square, every &s;ide con|taining four and twenty foot. It was erected long ago by King <HI>Talmas:</HI> From this Bulding to the Gate appears a very large Alley, &s;haded with lofty Maples; all along the &s;ides of which from the Entrance to that Apartment are placed at the di&s;tance of ten or twelve Paces one from another, certain &s;tone Mangers of a convenient height, and pla&s;tered over with Lime and Chalk, to tye the Hor&s;es that are made choice of out of the Royal Stables to the number u&s;ually of twelve or fifteen, or &s;ometimes more upon high Fe&s;tival days, or when any Em|ba&s;&s;adours or other Foreiners of great quality are admitted to have their fir&s;t Andience of the King. At what time they are conducted through this Alley through the mid&s;t of the&s;e Hor&s;es gorgeou&s;ly harne&s;&s;ed. For all their Capari&s;ons are enriched with precious &s;tones as thick as they can lie; the Chains, the Shooes, the Hammers, the Buckets, the Curry-combs, in a word, whatever is u&s;ed in a Stable is all of pure ma&s;&s;ie Gold, as we have already declared in its proper place. On the right and left Hand of the Apartment, were to be &s;een certain Beds of Flowers and Trees planted here and there at random according to the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> manner, where Nature only &s;eems to be the Garderies. Before and toward the South the Garden extends it &s;elf in Breadth and Length, divided as it were into Beds and &s;pacious Plots, parted one from another with tall Trees, and planted with &s;o many &s;orts of Flowers, that &s;ome continue blowing during all the three warmer Sea&s;ons of the Year. This Apartment is built for the mo&s;t part of Carpenters Work; nor is the Floor of it level with the Superficies of the Alley, but rai&s;ed about three foot above it. The Covering is Flat, &s;u&s;teined with turned Pillars, overlaid with Gold to a con&s;iderable thickne&s;s, &s;ome &s;ix or &s;even and twenty foot high. The ground-work of the Ceeling is of carved work in pieces an&s;wering one ano|ther, and forming Partitions, where the Gold gli&s;ters no le&s;s
<PB N="38" REF="239">
than in other places. Thus this Apartment is open of all &s;ides, but when the Curtains are let down, which are fa&s;tened at the top of the Pillars, equal with the Ceeling without &s;ide. And they always let them down either on one or the other &s;ide ac|cording to the Hour that they know the King will come. But when they let them down, they do not &s;uffer them to hang to the ground as we do; but draw them with their &s;trings to the next of the great Trees in the Garden, and then fa&s;ten them to the Bodies of the Trees in &s;uch a manner at the height of ten foot from the ground, that they &s;erve in&s;tead of large <HI>Umbrellaes,</HI> to prevent the Sun-beams from &s;hining into the Room, and yet without hindering the Company, whether &s;itting or &s;tanding, from having a full &s;ight of all that is done within.</P>
<P>The Curtains are of Crim&s;on Linnen, lined with Indian <HI>Chite</HI> mo&s;t gayly painted. The bands wherewith they are tied back, as are all the running &s;trings, are of coar&s;e Silk. The Body of the Apartment is divided into three parts &s;epara|ted only by &s;mall Bali&s;ters of Joyners work richly gilded. The two &s;ides make two Halls of &s;ix and thirty paces long, and &s;ixteen broad. Between the two Halls is to be &s;een a <HI>Talaar,</HI> or a Balcony of State rai&s;ed four foot higher than the Halls; in the mid&s;t of which &s;tand a large and deep Font of white Marble, which receives the Cry&s;tal water that continually falls into it from a Pipe of the &s;ame coloured Marble. The whole Room is gilded all over, and that &s;o thick, that altho it be above a hundred Years &s;ince it was fir&s;t laid on, there is no|thing to this day that appears either Tarni&s;hed or &s;hel'd off in any part.</P>
<P>It is called <HI>Talaar-Tavieleh,</HI> as we have already hinted, the <HI>Hall of the Stables,</HI> for that upon certain days, as we have &s;aid, the Hor&s;es of State are brought out, and tied clo&s;e by. For <HI>Talaar</HI> &s;ignifies properly an exalted Balcony, and <HI>Tavieleh</HI> denotes a Stable, or any other place where they tie Hor&s;es.</P>
<P>This was the Place, and thus adorned for the Coronation of the King. For the next day I had the liberty to go in, to look about me at lei&s;ure, and ob&s;erve the Magnificence of the Furniture, and of all that had been made u&s;e of at the Cere|mony. The two Halls were &s;pread with Carpets of Silk, and all along the &s;ides were placed a great number of low &s;quare Beds, covered with flowered Ti&s;&s;ue of Gold and Silver. The <HI>Talaar</HI> or Balcony of State in the middle, was hung and &s;pread with Carpets of Gold and Silver: The Cu&s;hions round about it being of a certain Stuff made in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> called <HI>Mach|meli-zer-haf,</HI>

which is a &s;ort of Velvet weaved in Flowers and Foliage, con&s;i&s;ting of Silk interwoven with Gold. It was al&s;o furni&s;hed with Ve&s;&s;els to &s;pit in, like tho&s;e in the other Halls, &s;ome of which were embelli&s;hed with &s;mall Rubies and Turcoi&s;es.</P>
<P>In the place de&s;igned for his <HI>Maje&s;ty,</HI> a Quilt was laid, &s;tuft with fine Sheeps Wool, four fingers thick, and between three and four foot in length; over which was &s;pread a very fine Coverlet of Indian Work pinked with Gold, being a mo&s;t ad|mirable piece of Workman&s;hip. This Carpet covered all the Quilt, and hung down four fingers on every &s;ide, by that means hindering the Quilt from being &s;een; be&s;ides that, it was kept tight at the two Corners by two great Apples of ma&s;&s;ie Gold &s;et with precious &s;tones; clo&s;e to which &s;tood two little Ve&s;&s;els to &s;pit in, &s;umptuou&s;ly wrought. At the other end lay a Cu|&s;hion of which the lower &s;ide was of Cloth of Gold, inter|mixed with red Flowers and green Leaves: As for the upper &s;ide I could not tell what Stuff it was made of, becau&s;e I could not come near enough to ob&s;erve it; be&s;ides that, it was all over covered with Diamonds, Emeralds, Pearl, and other Precious &s;tones, that ca&s;t a wonderful lu&s;tre, &s;o that it was impo&s;&s;ible to know the ground of that co&s;tly Embroidery.</P>
<P>The Room was enlightened with fourteen Lamps all of ma&s;&s;ie Gold, not hung up, but &s;et upon the ground as we &s;et our Candle&s;ticks upon Tables or Stands. The&s;e Branches, all of Duckat Gold, are &s;o &s;ub&s;tantial, that there are &s;ome which weigh &s;ixty Marks; and the lea&s;t weigh thirty or forty. Of the&s;e Lamps there were eight in the <HI>Talaar,</HI> in the Middle, and three in each of the Halls, where were al&s;o eight Candle&s;ticks with two Branches apiece of ma&s;&s;ie Gold al&s;o, three foot high, and weighing more than the Lamps.</P>
<P>The place for the Coronation, being thus prepared, they brought and laid upon the middle of the <HI>Talaar,</HI> the four Principal Pieces which are in a manner con&s;ecrated to this Ce|remony.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t was a <HI>Scourzie,</HI> or Seat which &s;erved in&s;tead of a Throne, being a little &s;quare Cu&s;hion Stool, three Geometrical feet in height; the feet of the Pillars that &s;upported the Corners being fa&s;hioned like &s;o many great Apples; and to &s;ecure the Seat, there ran as many Cro&s;s Bars both above and below. The upper part was &s;mooth and plain, without any thing that might make the Seat &s;ofter, being all the &s;ame materials with the re&s;t, that is, ma&s;&s;ie Gold very thick; the four Pillars al&s;o
<PB N="40" REF="241">
and the Feet being plated with Gold, and &s;et with little Rubies and &s;ome Emraulds. This &s;ame Stool at other times is kept very charily in the Trea&s;ury Royal, which is a Dungeon in the Fortre&s;s of <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> and &s;o weighty, that two men can hardly carry it. I &s;aw it there by good fortune; having the opportunity to get in, when the <HI>Vazier,</HI> or <HI>Farmer Royal</HI> of the City came to open all the <HI>Magazines</HI> and Clo&s;ets, in regard the King was the next day to &s;hew them to his Mother and his Wives.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Piece was a <HI>Taag,</HI> or <HI>Diadem,</HI> or <HI>Crown,</HI> for I can|not find any other word to expre&s;s it by in our Language: nor could the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> were they to tran&s;late the word <HI>Crown</HI> into their own Language, find a more proper word than their own <HI>Taag;</HI> which is that <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Crown or famous Bonnet, which &s;ome Travellers call the <HI>Sophy</HI>'s <HI>Bonnet,</HI> tho I know not for what rea&s;on. I have in another place delivered my opinion &s;ufficiently concerning it. It is a Flat Bonnet, &s;omewhat like the Mortar-Caps of the Pre&s;idents of the French Parliaments; only it is not altogether &s;o large, nor &s;o deep. It is made &s;ome|what &s;traiter at the lower end; and carries in the middle a Point that &s;eems to come out of the middle of the Bonnet, but is only &s;owed on, tho very neatly and artificially. This Point ri&s;es up about a fingers length, and le&s;&s;ens toward the end, tho at the top it &s;eems to grow bigger again. The Materials of the Bonnet prepared for the new King was of Cloth of Gold; bound about after the manner of a <HI>Dhul-bandt</HI> (which our Writers, for want of Language, erroneou&s;ly call a <HI>Turbant)</HI> with one of the fine&s;t and Thinne&s;t Calicuts that <HI>India</HI> could afford, and Ti&s;&s;ued with Silver upon the brims the breadth of two fingers. The out&s;ide of the Hollow of the Bonnet at the Top was covered all over with an Embroidery of Diamonds, from whence hung down &s;everal Chains of precious &s;tones that &s;haded all the re&s;t of the Circumference, and dangled down upon the Bonnet, which was no le&s;s &s;umptuou&s;ly embelli&s;hed with all the riche&s;t Jewels of the Crown: round about &s;tood little tufts re&s;embling Herons Feathers, all of Jewellers work, nothing inferiour to the re&s;t. In other parts of the Bonnet were erected little Plumes of Herons Feathers, and Birds of Paradi&s;e. The <HI>Dhul-bandt</HI> was all hung about with &s;trings of Precious &s;tones, Diamonds, Rubies, Emraulds and Topazes fa&s;tened to the Heron Plumes, which &s;trings covered all the <HI>Dhul-bandt</HI> from the top to the bottom, dangling down upon the <HI>Calicut</HI> Facing to keep it fa&s;t, and prevent it from unloo&s;ening. Ju&s;t over the forehead &s;hone another Heron-Tuft, much more
<PB N="41" REF="241">
glorious than all the re&s;t: from the top of which ro&s;e up three Sockets of Precious Stones, wherein were placed little Tufts of Herons Plumes.</P>
<P>The third Piece was a <HI>Chemchir,</HI> or Sword, of which the Hilt and Scabbard were all covered over with Precious Stones pro|portionably to the Diadem. All the Per&s;ian Swords are about three Fingers broad, and bowed backward almo&s;t like a Semi|circle. For they who profe&s;s to under&s;tand a Weapon in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> maintain that a Blade &s;o bowed cuts much keener, and makes a deeper wound than a &s;treight Sword, which they de|mon&s;trate by the Rules of Fencing, which we have not at this time lei&s;ure to examine.</P>
<P>The fourth Piece is a <HI>Gangher</HI> or Per&s;ian Dagger, of which we have given you the Portraiture, as of all the re&s;t; &s;o that there needs not any farther de&s;cription; For the infinite number of Precious Stones would not permit the &s;ight to judge of the Materials of the Sheath, tho there is no que&s;tion to be made but that it was of Gold.</P>
<P>Now to tell you the worth of the&s;e three la&s;t Pieces (for as to the fir&s;t it may be ea&s;ily computed) is a Task which I dare not undertake, becau&s;e I could never under&s;tand any thing of certainty in that concern. True it is, that I have heard a Lord of the Court aver, that as well the Crown as the Sword and Dagger were valued at above a hundred thou&s;and <HI>Tomans,</HI> which amount to near five Millions of our French Money. But I would not advi&s;e any per&s;on to believe it. For I know the <HI>Per|&s;ians</HI> too well, and particularly the Courtiers of that Country, for there is no People in the world le&s;s friends to Truth, and who take &s;o much plea&s;ure to multiply Objects, or to enhance the Grandeur and Magnificence of their Prince. However it is not altogether improbable what they &s;ay: for I have &s;een one of his Maje&s;ties Heron-Tufts, of which &s;ome <HI>Europeans</HI> in <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> valued one &s;ingle Diamond in the middle at <HI>eighteen,</HI> and the re&s;t at <HI>four and twenty thou&s;and pound &s;terling.</HI> If the Royal Diadem had any more than one Heron-Tuft of that Va|lue, or if that Ruby were upon it, which by the expre&s;s Com|mand of the decea&s;ed King, the Eunuch that had the charge of the Trea&s;ury &s;hewed me at <HI>Mazanderan,</HI> which be of an Oval form, weighed (as the &s;aid Eunuch told me) a <HI>hundred and &s;ixty Caratts,</HI> the <HI>Chains or Strings,</HI> with the <HI>Sword</HI> and <HI>Dagger,</HI> being proportionable in value, the three Pieces might well amount to a hundred thou&s;and <HI>Tomans.</HI> But notwith&s;tand|ing all this to tell you my opinion &s;incerely, I could ne|ver
<PB N="42" REF="242">
judge them to be worth above three parts of the money.</P>
<P>The&s;e three Pieces were laid near the Stool, and covered with a rich <HI>Toilet.</HI> Pre&s;ently his Maje&s;ty appeared coming out of the Bath, and arrayed him&s;elf in his u&s;ual Habit, tho more &s;umptuous than he was wont to wear; after that being entered into the Room of State, he &s;ate down in the Place that was pre|pared for him, and at the &s;ame time they who were appointed to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the Coronation, a&s;cended the <HI>Talaar,</HI> and ranged them|&s;elves in this Order.</P>
<P>Upon the Right &s;ide of his Maje&s;ty, at a little di&s;tance be|hind him &s;tood the <HI>Aga-Nazir Eunuch,</HI> who at that Ceremony performed the Office of High Chamberlain, carrying to that purpo&s;e at his Girdle a little Box of Gold glittering with Precious Stones, wherein were a good Number of Handkerchiefs, and Perfumes for his Maje&s;ties &s;ervice when he had a mind to make u&s;e of them.</P>
<P>A little behind him appeared &s;ix <HI>Georgian</HI> Children from fifteen to &s;ixteen years of Age, who had been made Eunuchs, extremely beautiful, as are mo&s;t of the young Children of that Country. They were &s;o placed as to make a half Circle about the King, &s;tanding upright without &s;o much as &s;tirring their hands which they held acro&s;s upon their Brea&s;ts; being &s;umptuou&s;ly habited in Linnen, who&s;e ground was Silver heightned with Gold in the &s;ame Order, and as far behind the Children, as they &s;tood behind the King, appeared a great number of old black Eunuchs, every one holding a long Mu&s;|quet in his hand, of which the Stock was garni&s;hed with Gold and Precious Stones.</P>
<P>Upon the Left hand of the King, which is e&s;teemed the mo&s;t Honourable among the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> &s;ate fir&s;t the Commi&s;&s;i|oner that repre&s;ented <HI>Dlahammed-Mehdi,</HI> the Prime Mini&s;ter; Next to him the &s;econd Commi&s;&s;ioner that repre&s;ented <HI>Gemchid-Kaan</HI> General of a Body of the Army; Next to him the Per&s;on that &s;upplied the Place of <HI>Maz&s;oud-Bek, Superinten|dant</HI> General of the Kings Demeans. In the fourth Seat, the Per&s;on Commi&s;&s;ioned by <HI>Mirza-&s;edreel-din,</HI> Principal Secretary of the Empire. <HI>Hemireh-Hamzeh-Mirzah-Daroga,</HI> Grand Provo&s;t of <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> and its Dependencies, took the fifth place. And <HI>Mirza-Refi&egrave;,</HI> e&s;teemed one of the mo&s;t Learned among the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> took the next.</P>
<P>Upon his Maje&s;ties Right Hand, in the &s;econd Place (for the fir&s;t was left void) in honour of <HI>Boadaak-Sultan,</HI> General
<PB N="43" REF="242">
of the Mu&s;quetteers, who was pre&s;ent but &s;tanding upright; near the Prince &s;ate the Per&s;on deputed by <HI>Mahammed-Kouli-Kaan</HI> Lord Chief Ju&s;tice. Below him two Places were left void for the chief A&s;trologer and his Colleague, who were retired to ob&s;erve the Lucky Hour. The fifth Place was filled by the mo&s;t learned and wittie&s;t per&s;on that was in all that great Kingdom, by the judgment of all men, being the Brother of the Prime Mini&s;ter, and great Uncle to the new Monarch by his Wife. His name was <HI>Mirza-Hali-Riza,</HI> and his Title <HI>Cheik-el-I&s;laam,</HI> or <HI>Ancient of the Law.</HI> For by the word <HI>I&s;laam,</HI> which properly &s;ignifies the Reverence which we pay to the divine Commands, by the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of our Mind and Will, they mean Religion, which they call the Law, by way of Ex|cellence. For at this day, as formerly among the Hebrews, all their Politicks depend upon Religion; and it is the Ancient of the Law who holds the Ballance of Affairs in his Hand, which cannot be determined without his Approbation. In the &s;ixth Place &s;ate <HI>Mirza-Moumen-Vazier,</HI> or Receiver General for his Maje&s;ty in <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> and its Dependencies.</P>
<P>I could never hear of any other Grandees but the&s;e that &s;ate. True it is, that the Halls on both &s;ides were full of Officers that &s;tood; &s;ome to authorize the Solemnity of the Coronation; &s;ome to be ready to execute the King's Commands, as they &s;hould receive them from the General of the Mu&s;quetteers, who for that day &s;upplied the Place of Lord High Steward of the Hou&s;hold; carrying in his hand, as a Badge of his Office, a large Truncheon of Gold, all &s;et with Precious Stones, and a round Ball at one End; and &s;tanding at the left hand of the King, from whom he received Orders, or to &s;ay better, to whom he gave directions. For the new King who had never &s;een any &s;uch &s;ight before, neither did nor &s;aid any thing but what was dictated to him.</P>
<P>About ten a clock at night the Chief of the A&s;trologers and his Companion, having been long ob&s;erving the Po&s;ition of the Stars, and Conjunctions of the Planets, returned at length to give notice that the Fortunate Hour for the Coronation of the King would be within twenty Minutes. Thereupon his Maje&s;ty or|dered the General, as he had been taught before, to lead them both to their Places.</P>
<P>In the mean time he whi&s;pered with the General, who gave him In&s;tructions how to behave him&s;elf upon all the &s;everal changes of the Solemnity: which the young Prince failed not to follow exactly, for fear of committing any Irregularity, for
<PB N="44" REF="243">
want of experience in an Action of &s;o publick and weighty a Concernment.</P>
<P>When the twenty Minutes were almo&s;t expired, the Grand A&s;trologer having winked upon the General to let him know that he might proceed, he told the King; who thereupon immediately, according to his In&s;tructions, ro&s;e up; and then all the re&s;t ro&s;e up likewi&s;e. At what time the General threw him&s;elf at his Maje&s;ties Feet, bowing to the very Ground; then ri&s;ing upon his Knees he drew out of the Bo&s;om of his Gar|ment, the Bag wherein was the Letter which the A&s;&s;embly had &s;ent to the New Monarch. Pre&s;ently he opened the Bag, took out the Letter, ki&s;&s;ed it, laid it to his Forehead, pre&s;ented it to his Maje&s;ty, and then ro&s;e up. The Prince having received it, returned it to him again, and commanded him to break it open and read it; which he did aloud very di&s;tinctly and lei&s;urely, to the end that all who were pre&s;ent at the Ceremony might hear the Contents, and under&s;tand that the Grandees of the King|dom had unanimou&s;ly elected the pre&s;ent Prince for King of <HI>Per|&s;ia,</HI> that they acknowledged him for &s;uch, and were ready to atte&s;t it if there were occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>When he had done reading, the King commanded him to &s;end for the Ancient of the Law, which he did; at what time the <HI>Lord Ancient,</HI> approaching his Maje&s;ty, threw him&s;elf at his Feet, and after the u&s;ual Pro&s;trations, he ro&s;e up again, took the Letter out of the Generals hand, to acknowledge and au|thorize it, to verifie the Seals, and atte&s;t that it was real. For that acknowledgment belongs to him as Chief of the Law, and in all &s;piritual matters. Having taken the Letter, and laid it on his head out of re&s;pect, he read it, and looked upon the Seals, and then returning ju&s;t before the King, he fell upon his Knees, and made three bows to the ground; by that hum|ble po&s;ture declaring his approbation of the Letter, and that the advancement of the Prince to the Empire was legal.</P>
<P>While the Spiritual Judge was thus employed, the General de&s;ired to know the Kings Re&s;olution, whether he would be Crowned by his own name, or a&s;&s;ume any other before his Co|ronation. Who made an&s;wer, that tho he altered his Condi|tion, he would not change his Name, but retain that of <HI>Sephi&egrave;</HI> which was given him in his Infancy. The General returned the Kings plea&s;ure to the <HI>Ancient of the Law,</HI> who was ri&s;en from the Kings Feet, where he had left the Letter. At the &s;ame in&s;tant therefore, the two Lords, the <HI>Ancient of the Law</HI> upon his Right, and the General upon his Left, conducted the Prince to the
<PB N="45" REF="243">
Chair of Gold, &s;o often mentioned before, placed in the middle of the Hall, and then the <HI>Ancient of the Law</HI> be&s;ought him to take his Place. Which he did, according to the Rules of the Law, wherein he had been in&s;tructed, with his face toward the <HI>Kaabba,</HI> or <HI>Oratory of Mecca.</HI> Then the <HI>Ancient of the Law</HI> &s;eating him&s;elf upon his Heels, which is the Po&s;ture u&s;ed by the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> when they pray to God, or when they are in the pre&s;ence of any Per&s;ons of high Dignity, &s;ome few paces di&s;tant from his Maje&s;ty di&s;covered the <HI>Diadem,</HI> the <HI>Sword</HI> and <HI>Dagger,</HI> and then &s;aid a Prayer to God, which he began with a &s;hort Confe&s;&s;ion of their Faith, and concluded with a Bene|diction upon the Royal Ornaments appointed for the Ceremony of the Coronation. The Prayer la&s;ted not above a quarter of an Hour; at what time ri&s;ing up, he took the Sword and girded it on upon his Maje&s;ties Left &s;ide; and hung the Dagger upon his Right. Then having made a &s;ign to the General to take off the Bonnet from the Kings head, he put on the <HI>Taagh</HI> or Diadem, uttering at the &s;ame in&s;tant certain Ver&s;es of the <HI>Alco|ran</HI> proper for the purpo&s;e, which he did before when he girt on the Sword and Dagger.</P>
<P>This done he ended, and gave place to <HI>Mirza-Refia,</HI> the great and learned Doctor already mentioned, who pre&s;ented him&s;elf to perform the <HI>Kotb&egrave;,</HI> which word in the Original &s;ig|nifies a Prayer. But by this Prayer is meant a Prayer in form of a Harangue; and perhaps they might give it the name of an Oration.</P>
<P>By an ancient Cu&s;tom, time out of mind, the&s;e Prayers were always to be divided into four Heads; to la&s;t half an hour, and to contain always the &s;ame Form. Only the Orator had the liberty to alter the Terms, and the Stile, and to give a new flight to his thoughts.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Head is called <HI>Hamde-Koda,</HI> or the <HI>Prai&s;e of God,</HI> becau&s;e the Orator here &s;peaks of nothing el&s;e, <Q>But of the Thanks which we always ought to render him for his Graces and Favours, &s;ince there is not that moment wherein we do not continually receive &s;ome new mark of his Kindne&s;s. That his Ble&s;&s;ings being like the Sources of great Rivers, that flow without cea&s;ing, and never &s;top their Cour&s;e, for which rea&s;on the ble&s;&s;ings of God, are called by the Di|vines, <HI>Flowing Ble&s;&s;ings,</HI> our Thanks therefore ought to be continual, and always running. That whatever his Su|preme Maje&s;ty expo&s;es to the Eyes of Men, whether it were in times pa&s;t, or now at this pre&s;ent, bears the Characters,
<PB N="46" REF="244">
and imprints the Seals of his affection toward us, and te&s;tifies that whatever he acts without him&s;elf, he does it all for the greate&s;t good of Mankind, in regard that Infinite Being is the be&s;t of all that do be&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e are their Expre&s;&s;ions, and very near the &s;en&s;e of the fir&s;t Head, which la&s;ts &s;ome half a quarter of an hour.</P>
<P><Q>The &s;econd Head is called, <HI>Nead Berpegamberhou ve doua&s;de Imaam; The Prai&s;e, Remembrance, and Acknowledgment of the Prophet, and of the twelve De&s;cendants and Lieutenants.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>And therefore it contains nothing more than the Acclama|tions and Benedictions which they give to per&s;ons which their &s;uper&s;tition has rendred Venerable among them; That you are the Fourteenth whom God has cho&s;en pure and unble|mi&s;hed; That he has made them &s;ucce&s;&s;ively Lords of all Mortals. That the Faith is not entire, if together with the Confe&s;&s;ion of the Divinity we do not likewi&s;e acknowledge the &s;ending of the&s;e Fourteen to be lawful, upon whom the Heavenly Lights are &s;hed down, to give light to wandring &s;ouls, and to &s;hew to all the way of Truth. Therefore we are obliged to glorifie them, to celebrate their Prai&s;es, to wi&s;h for their perpetual Welfare and Peace, and to their Family on Earth all manner of pro&s;perity: that their names may be ex|alted above all <HI>Created Beings.</HI> That Cur&s;es may be heaped upon their Enemies. And that all the Men in the Univer&s;e may be lead away, and become du&s;t at their Door.</Q> With &s;everal other Wi&s;hes of the &s;ame nature, which I have rendered as much word for word as is po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The third Head is that Royalty is of divine In&s;titution. <HI>Sel|temet ez Hokkam Koda,</HI> that is, <HI>that Royalty is of Divine In&s;titution.</HI> <Q>Upon which they ob&s;erve, That &s;ince God created the World, he has always governed his People by Prophets, and in their &s;tead by Kings, whom he has e&s;tabli&s;hed their Succe&s;&s;ours. That Kings are the <HI>Zel-Alla,</HI> or the &s;hadow of God; <HI>which is that which we call the Image of God.</HI></Q> But the word <HI>Image</HI> is &s;uch an Expre&s;&s;ion as they abhor as Idolatrous, a Term which they dare not make u&s;e of; believing at the &s;ame time, that they likened God to any Image, they &s;uppo&s;ed him at the &s;ame time to be Corporeal. They added withal,</P>
<P><Q>That as at all times we are obliged to &s;erve God, and to obey him, not only by the light and under&s;tanding which Heaven has infu&s;ed into us at our Birth, but by the Revela|tions which we have had from his Prophets, who have de|clared unto us his Will, we are in the &s;ame manner, and by
<PB N="47" REF="244">
the &s;ame Revelation bound to obey Kings, as being the <HI>Vali&egrave;</HI> or Sovereign Lieutenants of God, <HI>Gaanit-chin,</HI> &s;itting in his place on Earth, and that we ought to &s;ubmit to their Com|mands, without examining whether they be ju&s;t or no. In regard that in &s;ubmitting to their Commands we &s;ubmit at the &s;ame time to the Holy Books in all things, tho they &s;eem contrary to our Rea&s;on and Under&s;tanding, by which we &s;hewed blind obedience which God exacts from men; &s;ome|times trying our readine&s;s to &s;ubmit to him, by Commands that &s;eem unju&s;t, to render out &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion more acceptable and of greater value.</Q></P>
<P>The fourth and la&s;t Point is, <HI>Douhaa-Preray, padcha&egrave;, A Prayer for the King,</HI> <Q>Which contains a great number of Sup|plications for the long life of the pre&s;ent Monarch of the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> for his Health, for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of his Throne and the increa&s;e of his Conque&s;ts. That &s;ince this illu&s;trious Branch of the <HI>Imaanic</HI> Race is according to the true Law be|come the Lieutenant of the Monarch of all the Earth, and lawful Lord of the World, that therefore his Dominions may extend from the one to the other Pole; That his Maje&s;ty may always appear &s;urrounded with glory like the Sun. That his Word may have a con&s;training Power. That all his Wi&s;hes and De&s;ires may be accompli&s;hed; and that all things may &s;ucceed in a more glorious manner than ever in favour of King <HI>SEPHIE.</HI></Q> Which la&s;t word the Orator pronounced in a louder Tone than he had pronounced all the re&s;t, to the end that all the Throng might hear him di&s;tinctly.</P>
<P>And here it is to be ob&s;erved, that he ro&s;e on purpo&s;e at the end of his Oration, in regard that till then, during all the Ce|remony that Name had not been uttered before.</P>
<P>But at the &s;ame In&s;tant that they heard the Name of <HI>SEPHIE</HI> pronounced, all the whole A&s;&s;embly &s;trove which &s;hould &s;end forth loude&s;t acclamations of joy by repeating the u&s;ual <HI>Intch-Alla,</HI> or <HI>God grant it,</HI> which every one repeated five or &s;ix times. After which the <HI>Cheik-el-I&s;laam,</HI> or Ancient of the Law, was the fir&s;t that fell upon his Knees before the King, and bowing his Forhead three times to his Maje&s;ties Feet, pronounced a &s;econd Benediction in few words, which he concluded with zealous wi&s;hes of Pro&s;perity; and that he might &s;o Reign as to extend the Frontiers of his Dominion, and render his Subjects happy.</P>
<P>He made three Bows more at the Conclu&s;ion of his Harangue, which he uttered with a great deal of Eloquence, as they
<PB N="48" REF="245">
a&s;&s;ured me, tho he had had no time to prepare him&s;elf, as having been hurried half a&s;leep out of his Bed to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the So|lemnity.</P>
<P>After him all the Grandees, according to their Dignity, and the re&s;t who were of any Quality came and paid their re&s;pects to the Monarch with the three cu&s;tomary Pro&s;trations.</P>
<P>This done, his Maje&s;ty ro&s;e from his Seat of Gold and re|turned to his former Place, as did all the re&s;t where they &s;ate be|fore. For during the Ceremony they all &s;tood, there being none that &s;ate but the King.</P>
<P>In this manner was <HI>Sephi&egrave;</HI> the Second Crown'd, his Grand|father being the fir&s;t of that Name among all the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Mo|narchs. True it is, that the fir&s;t Founder of this Race was of the &s;ame Name, but he is not numbred among the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Kings, becau&s;e he was never put into the Catalogue. His Mode&s;ty would not &s;uffer him to accept the Title. For as the Hi&s;torians tell us, he always look'd upon the Throne to be an Illu&s;trious Torment, which under the vain appearances of hap|pine&s;s concealed continual pain and trouble.</P>
<P>This name of <HI>Sephi&egrave;</HI> has &s;everal &s;ignifications which amount to the &s;ame &s;en&s;e and meaning: for &s;ometimes it &s;ignifies a <HI>Friend,</HI> &s;ometimes <HI>elected,</HI> &s;ometimes <HI>pure</HI> or <HI>purified.</HI> Which I have &s;aid turn all to the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, for Friends are but per&s;ons &s;elected from others, and <HI>purified,</HI> which is the mo&s;t u&s;ual &s;ignification, and is not much remote from the other two. As for example, when the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> call (as they often do) the fir&s;t man <HI>Adam Safi&egrave; Alla,</HI> we may tran&s;late it the <HI>Man,</HI> the <HI>Friend,</HI> or the <HI>Elect,</HI> or the <HI>Purified of God.</HI> Which three Epithites agree very well in their &s;ignification. For the friends of God are his <HI>Elect:</HI> Nor can they be his Elect before he hath purified them. And therefore it is according as the word is placed, that &s;ometimes it &s;ignifies one thing, &s;ometimes another. As here for example, &s;peaking of the New King of the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> I &s;hould rather chu&s;e to tran&s;late <HI>Chae Safi&egrave;,</HI> the <HI>King Elect,</HI> than the <HI>King purified.</HI> True it is, that they who would have <HI>Safi&egrave;</HI> to &s;ignifie <HI>purified,</HI> depend upon the Etymology; For that the Root from whence <HI>Safi&egrave;</HI> is derived is <HI>Saf,</HI> which properly &s;ig|nifies <HI>Purity.</HI> But let this &s;uffice fot playing the Grammarian. The &s;ubject of my di&s;cour&s;e will not permit me to &s;top any longer upon the&s;e Trifles, but only to ob&s;erve by the way, that it was from the word <HI>Safi&egrave;</HI> that the Greeks borrowed the word <HI>Sophos.</HI> It will be more to the purpo&s;e to ob&s;erve the mi&s;take of our Writers upon the word <HI>Safi&egrave;.</HI> For they would have all
<PB N="49" REF="245">
the Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> to be called <HI>Sophies.</HI> I cannot but laugh when I find in their Writings the <HI>Grand Sophy,</HI> the <HI>Sophy of Per&s;ia,</HI> and the Sovereign <HI>Sophy.</HI> For the Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> are neither called <HI>Sophies</HI> in general, nor in particular. Could the Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> read our European Characters, and &s;hould &s;ee upon the Letters, that are written to them from &s;ome parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> the Title which is given them of <HI>Sophy,</HI> que&s;tionle&s;s they would &s;pit up|on them, and take it for an affront.</P>
<P>Therefore I would have tho&s;e that &s;peak, when occa&s;ion offers, of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> or whether they be the Mini&s;ters of Princes, to be careful how they commit this mi&s;take in their Di&s;patches to that Court: or whether they be tho&s;e Writers who profe&s;s to give a faithful Relation of a Country where they profe&s;s them|&s;elves to have been, and pretend to tell us what they have &s;een with their Eyes, yet vent a thou&s;and Lies and Stories, and over|confidently impo&s;e upon their Readers; I &s;ay I would have &s;uch per&s;ons content them&s;elves with only giving us the fal&s;e names of things, but that the things them&s;elves &s;hould be really true. Neverthele&s;s I find that in tho&s;e things they make very gro&s;s mi&s;takes; and therefore le&s;t people may think I decry others to gain the more credit to my own Relations; and to free my &s;elf from the la&s;h of the Proverb, <HI>That two of a Trade can never agree,</HI> I &s;hall for proof of what I a&s;&s;ert, bring an Example relating to this very Story it &s;elf, which I &s;hall not take out of any Book of Travels, (for it is not my Intention hereto attack any one of them) but from the <HI>Audir of Addre&s;s,</HI> wherein there is a relation of the Death of the late King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and of the Coronation of the pre&s;ent King, <HI>fol.</HI> 523.</P>
<P><Q>I cannot conclude without imparting to you the news which we have received from the Court of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> by Letters from <HI>Legorn,</HI> the fifth of this Month.</Q></P>
<P><Q>They tell us by an Expre&s;s di&s;patched from <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> to the Engli&s;h Merchants re&s;iding in <HI>Legorn,</HI> that the <HI>Sophie</HI> after a debauch of drinking, fell &s;ick at <HI>Khur,</HI> in his return from <HI>Casbin,</HI> and died four days after. That after his Death was known, in the City of <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> his Elde&s;t Son, about twen|ty years of Age, was Proclaimed by the Principal Mini&s;ter and other Officers, by the name of Grandfather <HI>Sha-Sophy.</HI> That the next day the Governour of <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> and the chief Lords of the Court, who accompanied the Body of the de|cea&s;ed King, being arrived, and having paid their Homage to the Prince, he &s;hewed him&s;elf in publick to his Subjects, who te&s;tified their joy by their loud Acclamations; and
<PB N="50" REF="246">
that afterwards he received the accu&s;tomed Pre&s;ents of the Nobility, as al&s;o of the Agents of <HI>England, France,</HI> and <HI>Holland.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>They add that &s;everal days were &s;pent in fea&s;ting and re|joycing by publick Proclamation, with a more than ordinary Magnificence as being a thing which they &s;aw plea&s;ed the hu|mour of the Prince, who they &s;ay is more addicted to Ex|pences than his Father, and that he having given Audience to the &s;ame Agents, he had promi&s;ed a Confirmation of the Priviledges which his Predece&s;&s;ors had granted them; and al&s;o to enlarge them, as he &s;hould &s;ee occa&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P>Had the Author of this News &s;tudied to frame a fal&s;e &s;tory, he could not have contrived it better; for that he &s;peaks no|thing of truth. This Expre&s;s which they a&s;&s;ure us to have been di&s;patched from <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> to <HI>Legorn,</HI> is a meer Fantome. Not one of the Engli&s;h ever di&s;patched any per&s;on in all that time, nor at any other time; I do not know that indeed they ever di&s;patched directly any Per&s;on from the Capital City of <HI>Per|&s;ia</HI> to that Port of <HI>Italy.</HI> Nor did ever that Monarch of the <HI>Per|&s;ians,</HI> whom they &s;o confidently call <HI>Sophy,</HI> ever go by that name in his own Country, nor any other like it. Whereas he &s;ays, that the King fell &s;ick of a debauch, and died four days after, it is of the &s;ame &s;tamp with the re&s;t.</P>
<P>He did not fall &s;ick of a debauch; neither did his di&s;temper carry him off in four days; for he lay in a langui&s;hing con|dition four Months and more. The place which the Relation calls <HI>Khur,</HI> where he &s;ays the King died, is a perfect <HI>Chimera.</HI> I have examined all my <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Geography, and can find no &s;uch place, either great or &s;mall, that is called by that name. As little of truth there is in what he farther adds, that it was in the Kings return from <HI>Casbin</HI> that he died. For the King had not been at <HI>Casbin</HI> in eight years before; but it was from the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea that he was then coming back, as has been already related in the Life of that great Monarch.</P>
<P>The Author of the Relation pa&s;&s;ing forward to the Election of his Succe&s;&s;our, goes on with the &s;ame &s;incerity as before. For the news of the decea&s;ed Kings death was not known in <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> before the Coronation of his Succe&s;&s;our, unle&s;s it were to &s;ome few per&s;ons of the highe&s;t Quality; nor was the Suc|ce&s;&s;our proclaimed in that City by the Prime Mini&s;ter, nor any other of the Prime Mini&s;ters of State, who were a hundred and forty Leagues off at that time. There are no publick Pro|clamations in that Country as among us. Nor was he pro|claimed,
<PB N="51" REF="246">
as his Grandfather is pretended to have been, under the name of <HI>Sha-Sophi,</HI> &s;ince neither the one nor the other ever bore that Name.</P>
<P><Q>That which follows after, That the Governour of <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> and the principal Lords of the Court, who accompanied the Corps of the decea&s;ed, being arrived there, and having paid their accu&s;tomed Homage, he &s;hew'd him&s;elf in publick to his Subjects, who te&s;tified their joy by their loud and extraordi|nary Acclamations.</Q></P>
<P>This whole Period, I &s;ay, contains as many impertinencies as there are words. The Governour of <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> never left the City; &s;o that he could not then be &s;aid to return the next Morning: nor was the Body of the decea&s;ed King ever brought thither, as being a thing that was never intended. Then for the Lords that accompanied the Corps, the fir&s;t that came to the Court did not come till within twenty days after, others not till thirty or forty. And as for the Acclamations of joy which he mentions, I heard none but tho&s;e of which I have already given an account; and yet I was pre&s;ent at the whole Cere|mony, &s;o that no body could be a better Witne&s;s than my &s;elf. Nor did the Intelligencer know any better which of the Agents, whether the <HI>Engli&s;h, French,</HI> or <HI>Holland</HI> Agent had his fir&s;t Au|dience of the New King, or what Pre&s;ents they made him, of which we &s;hall give an account in the &s;eries of our Di&s;cour&s;e. Let the Reader now judge, what credit there is to be given to Relations, which are &s;uppo&s;ed to have been &s;ent to that Country, which are only grounded upon uncertain Reports, and Letters of Merchants and Travellers written without judgment, who upon occa&s;ion, &s;peaking of other Affairs touch upon &s;omething that was tran&s;acted in that Country.</P>
<P>But now to return to our bu&s;ine&s;s. After the Young King, and tho&s;e that &s;tood of each &s;ide were returned to their Places, the General of the Mu&s;quetteers having whi&s;pered &s;ome few Minutes in the Kings Ear, among &s;everal other things of le&s;&s;er Importance, gave out the&s;e four principal Commands in his Ma|je&s;ties name.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That both the &s;oft and loud Mu&s;ick &s;hould play in the two Balconies upon the top of the great Building, which &s;tands at one end of the Palace Royal, called the <HI>Kai&s;ari&egrave;,</HI> or <HI>Imperial Place.</HI> No Nation was di&s;pen&s;ed with, whether <HI>Per&s;ians, Indians, Turks, Mu&s;covites, Europeans,</HI> or others, which was immediately done. And this &s;ame Tintamarr or Confu&s;ion of In&s;truments, which &s;ounded more like the noi&s;e of War than Mu&s;ick, la&s;ted twenty
<PB N="52" REF="247">
days together without intermi&s;&s;ion, or the interruption of Night. Which number of twenty days was ob&s;erved to an&s;wer the number of the Young Monarch's years, who was then twenty years of Age.</P>
<P>The &s;econd was, that the Palace &s;hould be furni&s;hed with u&s;ual Guards, to the &s;ame Number, and in the u&s;ual Places as in the time of the decea&s;ed Monarch.</P>
<P>The third was, that they &s;hould go and deface the Name of <HI>Habas</HI> out of all the Seals and Signets of State, which are all of Precious Stones, which were brought from Court, in a Pur&s;e &s;ealed up with the Prime Mini&s;ters Seal, and that the Name of <HI>Sephi&egrave;</HI> &s;hould be engraved in the room of the other. That if in any of the Seals the Name of <HI>Habas</HI> could not be conveni|ently Era&s;ed, that the engraving &s;hould be entirely taken away, to make room for another Sculpture-upon a new Superficies; or if the Pieces were &s;o delicate that they could not endure de|facing, that they &s;hould be broken to pieces, and new &s;tones be engraved.</P>
<P>The fourth, That all the old Coins and Stamps &s;hould be broken, and other new Money made with the Name of the pre|&s;ent Prince upon it. And that care &s;hould be taken to coin with all &s;peed again&s;t the next day between &s;ix&s;core and a hun|dred and forty <HI>Tomans,</HI> which amount to between five or &s;ix hundred pounds &s;terling of our Money.</P>
<P>This was done with that &s;peed that the Sum was ready the next day in great Pieces, as is u&s;ual, to the value of eighteen pence, for the King to be&s;tow as he plea&s;ed him&s;elf. The &s;ame day one of the&s;e Pieces came to my hands; and the Per&s;on from whom I had it a&s;&s;ured me, that there had been &s;ome of the &s;ame bigne&s;s coined in Gold, which I am apt to believe, tho I never &s;aw any. Round about the Edge were engraved the twelve names of <HI>Mahomet's</HI> Succe&s;&s;ours, with the&s;e words in the middle, <HI>Bende, Shae-din-Safi&egrave;-e&s;t; The Sovereign Lieutenant of the King of the World according to the true Law is Safi&egrave;.</HI></P>
<P>We have in another Place explained the&s;e In&s;criptions more exactly and literally. On the other &s;ide was this <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Di|&s;tich:</P>
<Q><L>Zibad De&s;ti&egrave; &s;hae Abas &s;anie,</L>
<L>Safi&egrave; zad Zikkeh, &s;aheh Karani&egrave;.</L></Q>
<P>That is, <HI>After Habas the Second was in Corporeal Being.</HI> Or thus:</P>
<Q><PB N="53" REF="247">
<P><HI>After Habas the Second quitted his Corporeal Being, Safi&egrave; Ma&s;ter of the World coined this Money.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Which is as much as to &s;ay, He was declared King, in regard that in tho&s;e Countries, as well as here, none but Sovereigns can coin Money.</P>
<P>Underneath were the&s;e words: <HI>Zarby &s;efahaan hazar haftad ou Heft, Coined at</HI> I&s;pahan <HI>the year of the</HI> Hegirah 1077.</P>
<P>It was almo&s;t near Midnight before the Ceremony ended. At what time the King ro&s;e up in his Royal Habiliments, which he did not put off till he was retired into his particular Apart|ment in the Womens Palace. All the while there was to be ob|&s;erved a great alteration in the Countenance of the Young Prince. He looked with a Countenance all in di&s;order, like a Per&s;on that was not well in his Sen&s;es. And indeed what other could be expected from a Per&s;on that had been all along mued up under a clo&s;e confinement, and had never &s;een the World? Be&s;ides that by a &s;ecret Fatality of the ill humour of his Father, he had been &s;hut up in a more rigorous Impri&s;on|ment, than ever was practi&s;ed before toward the Kings Children? Could he ob&s;erve a certain Po&s;ture of Maje&s;ty, that &s;hould have performed all things after a &s;urprizing manner, who had never been in&s;tructed before? Much le&s;s, was he able to make any Reflections upon him&s;elf. Add to this, that the Young Prince pa&s;&s;ed of a &s;udden from one Extremity to another. He heard him&s;elf called <HI>Ma&s;ter of the World,</HI> He that but a little be|fore was in condition little inferiour to that of a Slave. True it is, that he wanted for no Conveniences in his Captivity, which was accompanied with all the Plea&s;ures grateful to the Sen&s;es; but tho&s;e Plea&s;ures became Torments, when &s;owered with the continual fears of Death, or deprivation of his Eyes that continu|ally threatned him.</P>
<P>And this was that which made him he could not tell what to do. For what may we &s;ay of that la&s;t a&s;&s;ault that attacked his very Soul? How many di&s;mal Apparitions did the dreadful Cries and frantick Lamentations of his Mother and his Wives, and others of the &s;ame Sex pre&s;ent to his Mind? His Soul, to &s;peak after the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> manner, was like a Sea, which being agi|tated by a furious Tempe&s;t, expre&s;&s;es its di&s;order by the roaring of the Waves, and &s;hews the di&s;turbance it was in after the Storm is over, and tho a plea&s;ing Calm &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>The Grand Dutche&s;s (for that Title is given to the Mother of the New King from the very moment of her Sons being Crowned) was not in a wor&s;e condition. They had told her
<PB N="54" REF="248">
the very fir&s;t words which the General of the Mu&s;quetteers had uttered, throwing him&s;elf at her Sons Feet: they brought her the news every Minute of what pa&s;&s;ed. But Fear and Grief had &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed her Imagination that there was no entrance for any other Pa&s;&s;ion. It was above a quarter of an hour before &s;he would &s;o much as li&s;ten to the welcome news which they brought her; &s;he refu&s;ed ob&s;tinately to believe. And tho &s;he had &s;uch forcible rea&s;ons to rejoyce, &s;he &s;till continued weeping and lamenting according to the humour of her Sex, that are willing to dwell upon &s;orrowful Objects, and wilfully refu&s;e to put away tho&s;e Idea's from their Minds. However at length &s;o many Eunuchs came to tell her the news of the Death of her Husband, and the Election of her Son, for who&s;e Corona|tion they were preparing, that &s;he began to lend an Ear, and to &s;urcea&s;e her fears. Neverthele&s;s her Soul continued &s;till in &s;u&s;pence between Joy and Grief: For as the good Fortune of her Son and his Exaltation afforded her a happy occa&s;ion of Gladne&s;s, &s;o the mournful death of her Husband recalled her Tears: So that tho&s;e two Pa&s;&s;ions equally prevailing in her heart kept the ballance &s;o even that her joys and &s;orrows hung in an equal Poi&s;e. But at length Cu&s;tom and good Manners turn'd the Scales. So that for a while &s;he relap&s;ed into her fir&s;t Commotions: &s;he rent her Garments, calling upon the Soul of the Decea&s;ed, expo&s;tulating with him as if he had been pre|&s;ent, what rea&s;on he had to quit the World and leave her in that forlorn condition; with other moans and lamentations of the &s;ame nature. However &s;he gave over when &s;he under|&s;tood that the King her Son was returning to her. Thereupon, after &s;he had performed the u&s;ual Ceremonies of Purification which the Law ordains, &s;he changed her Habit, as did the Prin|ce&s;s the New Monarchs Wife, with the re&s;t of the Ladies of Quality that belonged to the Court, to receive the King, who till then had lived among them as a Pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as they had notice that the New King was entered into their Palace, they went all to meet him. The Great Dutche&s;s was the fir&s;t that paid her duty to him upon her Knees, bowing her Head three times to the ground: which done, his Wife and his Concubines did the &s;ame; and then the re&s;t of the Per&s;ons belonging to the Place, who&s;e Quality and Employ|ments priviledged them for that Honour. I could not learn what was done more the re&s;t of the Night: for I have already informed you how difficult it is to be informed of the Tran&s;|actions in tho&s;e &s;ecret Habitations, that &s;eem to be Regions
<PB N="55" REF="248">
of another World. There are none but Women that can ap|proach within a League of it, or &s;ome Black Eunuchs, with whom a Man may as well conver&s;e with &s;o many Dragons that can di&s;cover tho&s;e &s;ecrets, and you may as well tear out their hearts, as a &s;yllable upon that Text. You mu&s;t u&s;e a great deal of Art to make them &s;peak; ju&s;t as we tame Serpents in the <HI>Indies,</HI> till they make them hi&s;s and dance, when they plea&s;e. In the mean time the noi&s;e of the <HI>Nakara</HI> re&s;ounded from the Terraces of the Royal Palace. And in regard it continued longer than ordinary, which is generally not above three Quarters of an Hour, it gave an occa&s;ion to tho&s;e that were wakened with the din to wonder what was the matter. But in regard it was then Midnight, and an un&s;ea&s;onable time to &s;tir out of the Hou&s;e there were very few, unle&s;s they were &s;uch as lived near the Royal Palace that would &s;o far gratifie their Curio&s;ity as to enquire the Rea&s;on. The re&s;t contented them|&s;elves till next Morning, at what time they under&s;tood that <HI>Sa|phi&egrave;</HI> the Second was &s;eated upon the Throne as Succe&s;&s;our to his Father <HI>Habas</HI> decea&s;ed.</P>
<P>I leave the Reader to conjecture how every body was &s;urpri|&s;ed. For my part I apprehended &s;omething &s;o &s;trange upon the novelty of the Accident, that I thought my &s;elf in a dream. That they could conceal the Death of &s;o great and Potent a Prince &s;o long, and yet that it &s;hould not be known till after the Son was &s;eated upon the Throne and actually Crowned, of which I had never read the like Example. But this was one Ma&s;ter-piece of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Wi&s;dom, never too much to be commended. By means of which Addre&s;s, the State changed its Ma&s;ter, without any alteration in Form; and &s;uffered one of the mo&s;t dangerous Re&s;olutions without being &s;en&s;ible of it; in&s;o|much that in all <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> there did not appear the lea&s;t &s;ign of Con|&s;ternation. They heard without any di&s;turbance that <HI>Habas</HI> was dead without making a Will, and with &s;atisfaction received the Per&s;on whom they had Elected in his Place. There was no body that appeared either very &s;ad or overjoyed: No body that plaid the Cen&s;urer to find fault with what was done, much le&s;s any one that was mutinous. For all things ran in their u&s;ual Cour&s;e. The Merchants opened their Shops as they did the day before, and every one followed their Occa&s;ions, as little con|cerned as if no &s;uch thing had hapned.</P>
<P>Methought that then <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> was one of the Places Repub|lick, above the reach of Fortune, and exempted from tho&s;e Ac|cidents that trouble the Tranquillity of Mortals.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="249">
Our <HI>Europeans</HI> only took the <HI>Alarm</HI> upon the news of this great and &s;udden Revolution, and they that were in their Hou&s;es in the City kept their doors &s;hut all the fir&s;t part of the Morning. Among the re&s;t the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who were retired to their own Home, to the number of Forty. With them was M. <HI>Hubert de Lare&s;&s;e,</HI> who was &s;ent by the Orders of the <HI>Hol|land</HI> Company in the Quality of an Emba&s;&s;adour to the de|cea&s;ed King with Commi&s;&s;ions and Pre&s;ents for his Maje&s;ty. He was then ju&s;t about to return; but under&s;tanding the Change, he who having been long employed by the <HI>Company,</HI> had been in &s;everal parts of <HI>India,</HI> and had there &s;een upon the death of Princes &s;trange Commotions, and dangerous Seditions, wherein many Murders and Roberies had been with impunity commit|ted; He, I &s;ay, made cautious by this hazardous Experience, was not a little fearful of the &s;ame Con&s;equences of &s;uch a Change, and therefore advi&s;ed the Dutch to keep in, to prevent the evil Accidents of mutinies upon &s;uch occa&s;ion in hopes of Booty and Pillage. But the Ingenuity of the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> and the Excellency of their Government might have &s;pared him tho&s;e Fears. However when the Superiour of the <HI>Capuchins</HI> brought him word about nine of the Clock in the Morning that all was quiet, that he might no longer di&s;cover his mi&s;tru&s;t of the Publick Security; he ordered the Doors to be opened. This Superiour of the <HI>Capuchins</HI> was the Reverend Father <HI>Raphael</HI> of <HI>Mans.</HI></P>
<P>At the &s;ame time the <HI>New Monarch</HI> coming out of the Inner part of his Palace, went and &s;ate in the great Hall where he was Crowned the Night before, and then it was that all the Gran|dees, who were then at <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> qualified to receive that Ho|nour, were admitted to ki&s;s the ground before his Feet. This Ceremony la&s;ted till ten of the Clock; at what time his Ma|je&s;ty ri&s;ing from his Seat took Hor&s;e; and that was the fir&s;t time that ever he rode out of the Place where he was born. And according to the Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> he made a Cavalcade round his Palace very lei&s;urely, and with little attendance, riding in the middle at the di&s;tance of twenty Paces from them that marched before, and tho&s;e that followed after, only twelve Footmen went of each &s;ide, before and behind his Hor&s;e; and all this to the end he might be the better &s;een by the People.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty had on a <HI>Cabaye,</HI> or <HI>Georgian</HI> Ve&s;t of Sattin and Silver, thick powdered with Violets; the forepart of which upon his Brea&s;t was adorned with long Rows of Pearls and Diamonds, &s;ix of each &s;ide. Over his Ve&s;t he wore a &s;hort

Upon his right &s;ide &s;tuck his Dagger, of which the Sheath and Hilt were &s;et with Emeralds and other Precious Stones: nor was his Sword le&s;s gorgeou&s;ly embelli&s;hed. Upon his Head he wore a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Cap or <HI>Dhul-bandt,</HI> made of very fine Silk and Gold, with a Royal <HI>Heron-Tuft</HI> fa&s;tened before in a Ro&s;e of Diamonds and Rubies. The People from all Parts flock together in Heaps to &s;ee their New Sovereign; who not being accu&s;tomed to &s;ee &s;uch Sholes of People, as having always lived remote from Noi&s;e and Hurry, &s;eemed, as he had done at the Coronation Ceremony, to look like one that knew not well how to behave him&s;elf, as being not a little dazled with &s;o much &s;udden &s;plendour. However he &s;till looked up, &s;o that all might &s;ee his Eyes, where &s;weetne&s;s &s;ate intermixed with Maje&s;ty, which immediately begat both Love and Re|&s;pect, as did all the re&s;t of his Body which was exactly &s;haped.</P>
<P>His Stature was Tall, and withal proportionable and grace|ful; his Face was round, with a plea&s;ing Air in his Lineaments, a little marked with the Small Pox. His Eyes blue, his Hair white, which he therefore dyed black, as being the colour mo&s;t e&s;teemed by the <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI> They who know that all the fol|lowers of <HI>Mahomet</HI> &s;have their Hair, will under&s;tand that I mean the hair of his Beard, which at tho&s;e years began to &s;pread its early Down upon his Lips and Cheeks, wherein he was very like his Father, only that he had not &s;o long a No&s;e, nor &s;o full and open an Eye. The whitene&s;s of his Complexion, which the Sun had not at all altered as yet, had &s;omething in it, which I cannot expre&s;s, that was extremely charming. In a word, there was nothing in the Prince which did not then appear very graceful. I &s;ay, <HI>then;</HI> for now he is very much changed, and &s;till changes every day.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty having been an Hour abroad returned into the Womens Apartment. from whence he did not &s;tir out all that day, after he had given Orders, or rather Leave to the <HI>General of the Mu&s;quetteers,</HI> and the <HI>Nazir Eunuch,</HI> who were then his chiefe&s;t Favourites, to di&s;patch &s;uch bu&s;ine&s;s as required ha&s;t.</P>
<P>He did nothing more all the re&s;t of that day, nor was there any other Pomp or Show, contrary to the general expectation. For the King was willing to defer the time of Publick Rejoycing till all the Court &s;hould be arrived at <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI> In the mean while, there was no alteration to be &s;een in the City; The
<PB N="58" REF="250">
Shops were open, the Trade&s;men followed their bu&s;ine&s;s in the publick Streets, and the Markets were kept till a little before Night. And this was ob&s;erved not only in the <HI>Capital City,</HI> but over all that Va&s;t Empire. So that this great Revolution made no change either in the E&s;tate or Bu&s;ine&s;s of any Per&s;on. It was an ab&s;olute Calm, for which we may give two Rea&s;ons. The one was the Prudence of the <HI>Great Ones,</HI> who under&s;tood &s;o well to conceal the Death of the decea&s;ed Monarch: The other was, the ab&s;olute Authority of the Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and the terrible Awe that Super&s;tition infu&s;es into the People. At the bare Command of the Prince the highe&s;t in Dignity come and offer their Heads, and &s;ubmit them&s;elves to the &s;troke of Death, without daring to pre&s;ume to ask the rea&s;on why?</P>
<P>In this manner, no body appeared either pen&s;ive or glad; no body di&s;covered the lea&s;t &s;ign of di&s;content. Not but that I believe there were &s;everal who concealed their &s;orrows, for fear of offending the New King. They con&s;idered that <HI>Habas</HI> the Second, of who&s;e death they had &s;o lately heard, was fit to govern; that he was kind and gentle to his Subjects; that he was feared abroad; but kept all things in peace and tranquillity at home. That he was a lover of Ju&s;tice, and took care that his Officers did not abu&s;e their Authority, and oppre&s;s the People; neverthele&s;s, that a &s;ecret Providence had cut him off in the mid&s;t of &s;o fair a Race, and in the flower of his Age, when he had &s;trength of judgment to de&s;ign, and force of body to execute. That on the contrary, the Young Prince who was now a&s;cended to the Throne, had never &s;een any thing, and was as it were but an Apprentice, not only in the Act of Government, but in all other things. So that they were likely to &s;uffer long through the tenderne&s;s of his Age, as they had experienced before in the Reigns of his Predece&s;&s;ors upon the &s;ame grounds.</P>
<P>But they who mo&s;t laid to heart the mournful death of the decea&s;ed King, were the Chri&s;tians. That Prince had always &s;hewed him&s;elf kind and favourable to their Religion, &s;hewing them extraordinary Civilities, and rebuking the Mini&s;ters of the Law, and Interpreters of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> when they &s;ought to ex|a&s;perate him again&s;t the Profe&s;&s;ors of our Religion.</P>
<P>Which he did more than once; as we do relate in his Life; in&s;omuch as the <HI>Armenians</HI> would &s;ay one among another, that he was more a Chri&s;tian than a <HI>Mahometan.</HI> Not but that he was very much devoted to his own Religion, even as much as the mo&s;t zealous of his Predece&s;&s;ors; only he thought that the violence of Princes toward the Liberty of mens Con&s;ciences
<PB N="59" REF="250">
was a thing neither Acceptable to God, nor conformable to Rea&s;on. That he was not to cea&s;e being a Man becau&s;e he was a <HI>Mahometan;</HI> That if Providence had exalted him to a Throne, it was that he &s;hould carry him&s;elf like a King, and not like a Tyrant: and that there was nothing more Barbarous nor Tyrannical, than &s;uch a Conduct as not only violated the Law of Nations, but of Nature al&s;o; which de&s;ire that men &s;hould live in Society one with another, &s;o far from being at Enmity that they &s;hould be mutual A&s;&s;i&s;tances one to another. La&s;tly, that God alone was the Lord of the Con&s;cience, and Ma&s;ter of the Will: That for his part he had nothing to do but with the outward Government of the Kingdom; and for that rea&s;on it became him to do Ju&s;tice to all his Subjects of what&s;oever Religion, &s;ince they were all Members of his King|dom.</P>
<P>He per&s;i&s;ted &s;o con&s;tantly in this judgment and opinion, that notwith&s;tanding all the endeavours of the Doctors of the <HI>Maho|metan</HI> Super&s;tition to incen&s;e him again&s;t the Chri&s;tians, they could never vanqui&s;h his Re&s;olution. He looked upon them as People who&s;e fal&s;e zeal rendred them incapable of Right Rea&s;on; or as Per&s;ons bya&s;&s;ed by Intere&s;t, who under the &s;pe|cious pretence of Religion would make them&s;elves great among the Multitude; or el&s;e make u&s;e of the credit which they had already, to make Parties, and Factions in the Kingdom, and di&s;turb the Government. And therefore he always took delight to le&s;&s;en and contemn &s;uch &s;ort of people.</P>
<P>This clearly appeared, when he prevented the Creation of a new <HI>Sadre,</HI> or <HI>Mahometan Pontiff,</HI> or Metropolitan of the whole Empire, in&s;pects into all the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Revenues which are managed by inferiour Officers under his Authority, and by his Orders: for the word <HI>Sadre</HI> &s;ignifies the Brea&s;t of the Law. <HI>Habas</HI> the Second al&s;o had &s;everely per&s;ecuted the <HI>Cheik-el-I&s;laam,</HI> or <HI>Ancient of the Law,</HI> who is another <HI>Petty Sovereign</HI> in &s;piritual Affairs. For it is his bu&s;ine&s;s to take cog|nizance of, and to re&s;olve all Ca&s;es of Con&s;cience in Matters of Religion as we have already ob&s;erved. The King had like to have condemned him to death, upon an Information, that &s;ome of the Interpreters &s;hould whi&s;per one among another, that it would be the be&s;t way to advance to the Throne one of the Sons of the <HI>Ancient of the Law,</HI> who would be more zealous for their Religion, than the pre&s;ent Monarch: and he had certainly put his de&s;ign in execution, had not the <HI>Ancient of the Law</HI> pre|vented him by offering to his di&s;plea&s;ure both his own and the
<PB N="60" REF="251">
Head of all his Children that attended him. That &s;pectacle ap|pea&s;ed his wrath; believing that per&s;on innocent whom he &s;aw &s;o lowly humbled before him.</P>
<P>He had al&s;o thrown out of favour his <HI>Pichnaamaz,</HI> or <HI>Chap|lain,</HI> and Confe&s;&s;or; for no other rea&s;on but becau&s;e he continu|ally declaimed again&s;t the Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>The Prime Mini&s;ter of State that governed during the Mino|rity of <HI>Habas,</HI> was no le&s;s aver&s;e to the Chri&s;tians than any of the re&s;t, as being a zealous <HI>Mahumetan;</HI> and therefore he con|tinually incen&s;ed his Ma&s;ter again&s;t them, and would have had the King have given command that they &s;hould carry a Mark, like the Jews, to di&s;tingui&s;h them from <HI>Mahumetans:</HI> but the King continually denied him; and it is reported that the di&s;|gu&s;t which he took again&s;t him for that very thing contributed not a little to his Fall.</P>
<P>After the&s;e great Examples of his Lenity, the Prince being now become more ab&s;olute, not only &s;uffered the Chri&s;tians to enjoy the free exerci&s;e of their Religion; but al&s;o granted the &s;ame freedom to the Jews; notwith&s;tanding all the &s;ecret and publick oppo&s;ition, which the <HI>Mulla</HI> or Religious People could make. Nay, it hapned that the King took an occa&s;ion to de|pre&s;s all that Race of Hypocrites. For being &s;o tran&s;ported as they were to talk of depo&s;ing him, as an Infidel, who kept too much Society with the Profane, the &s;ecret hatred which he bare them from that time forward gave him a plau&s;ible pre|tence to &s;hew his re&s;ent, and that I may u&s;e the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Phra&s;e, <HI>to break their Teeth,</HI> that is to &s;ay, to prevent their Biting.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Armenians</HI> who were his Subjects, and profe&s;&s;ed the Chri&s;tian Religion, he was wont to tell the Grandees of the King|dom, that it would be a vile Inju&s;tice, for People that laboured for the good of the Kingdom, by their Indu&s;try and Commerce, to be excluded from the enjoyments of Peace and that Plenty of which they were the principal In&s;truments.</P>
<P>Therefore it was not without ju&s;t cau&s;e that the Chri&s;tians mourned in their hearts for the lo&s;s of &s;o good a Prince: their misfortune &s;eemed to be without remedy, in regard the New Monarch, whom they &s;aw exalted in his room, was but a young Man, from whom they could not promi&s;e to them&s;elves any thing of a&s;&s;urance; and tho he &s;hould be favourably en|clined, and pre&s;erve the &s;ame kindne&s;s for them as his Prede|ce&s;&s;our, he could not, in regard of his want of experience, long continue his good Intentions, by rea&s;on of the daily Importuni|ties
<PB N="61" REF="251">
of his Coun&s;ellours, and the perpetual clamours of the <HI>In|terpreters</HI> of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and the Doctors of the Law.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides that, a Prince of his Age could not well tell where to find a more expert per&s;on to be his Confident than the General of the Mu&s;quetteers, who was a terrible Enemy of the Chri&s;tians, as well out of his one natural humour, as for that he hated the <HI>Superintendant,</HI> whom the Chri&s;tians had for a long time looked upon as their Protector at Court.</P>
<P>But among all the Chri&s;tians none were more afflicted for the death of the late King than the <HI>French,</HI> or <HI>Europeans:</HI> They had the &s;ame rea&s;ons for their &s;orrow with the Native Chri&s;ti|ans, (for the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> make no di&s;tinction between the &s;everal Sects among us) but there was one Rea&s;on of greater Impor|tance. For that they were &s;trangers, remote from their Coun|try, and could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t where they were without the favour of the Sovereign Prince. As for the decea&s;ed King, he had ex|tended his favours toward them in a high mea&s;ure: he had u&s;ed them more like a Father than a Friend: and his publick affecti|on begat them re&s;pect and honour in all Societies. But they could not hope for any &s;uch favours from his Succe&s;&s;our. Their condition under the decea&s;ed King was too advantageous, that they &s;hould pre&s;ume to a&s;pire to that degree again: rather they expected that the change of the Prince would be the change of their good fortune into bad.</P>
<P>At the time of this doleful Revolution, there was at <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> the Dutch Emba&s;&s;adour, as I have already ob&s;erved, <HI>M. Hu|bert de Laire&s;&s;e;</HI> being &s;ent from <HI>Batavia</HI> by the Order, and on the behalf of the <HI>Holland</HI> Company, with con&s;iderable Pre|&s;ents for the King and his Principal Mini&s;ters, with a de&s;ign to renew their Alliance, and to reque&s;t certain Favours of his Maje&s;ty, in reference to their Trading in his Dominions, which was interrupted as well by the Governour of <HI>Fars,</HI> which is properly <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> as the Officers of the famous Port of <HI>Bender-Haba&s;&s;i,</HI> or <HI>Habas's Port</HI> or <HI>Market,</HI> (for that the the fir&s;t King of that name was the fir&s;t that made it a Place of Trade) to tran&s;port their Merchandize from <HI>Ormus</HI> to that Place, which is over again&s;t it, and in a more commodious &s;ituation: where the <HI>Hollanders</HI> have their principal Factory. The Emba&s;&s;adour arrived at Court in <HI>July;</HI> and at his fir&s;t coming had his Audi|ence in the Valley of <HI>Saver</HI> in the Province of <HI>Mazendaraan;</HI> four Leagues from the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea; and twelve from <HI>E&s;ter|abaat.</HI> And he followed his bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o clo&s;e, and managed it &s;o well, that in five Weeks he was di&s;patched, and obtained of
<PB N="62" REF="252">
his Maje&s;ty whatever he de&s;ired. In <HI>September</HI> he returned to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> laden with joy, for the extraordinary favours which he had received, as well in the behalf of the Company, as for the honour had been done to his own Per&s;on. He intended to be gone in <HI>October,</HI> becau&s;e he was obliged to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion at <HI>Bender-Abas</HI> of the Employment of <HI>Director of the Trade,</HI> and to look after other affairs of the Company in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> in the room of the Heer <HI>Henry Wuan-Vick,</HI> dead between three and four Months before. All things were ready for his Journey, and the fourth of <HI>October</HI> was the day prefixed. But this great and unexpected Change which the death of <HI>Habas</HI> the Second, and the Election of <HI>Sephie</HI> the Second brought, put a &s;top to all bu&s;ine&s;s. Nor was it a &s;mall trouble to him when he fir&s;t heard the news, as well for the great love and e&s;teem which he had for that Mo|narch who had obliged him with &s;o many favours, as for that he knew the Accident fell out unluckily for the Profit of his Ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, He found that the long and tedious Emba&s;&s;ie to the de|cea&s;ed King, which he had accompli&s;hed &s;o much to his &s;a|tisfaction, would be altogether fruitle&s;s: for that the Compa|ny would be con&s;trained upon this Change to &s;end another new Emba&s;&s;ie to congratulate the New King upon his coming to the Crown. In the next place he found, that all that he had ob|tained at Court with &s;o much trouble and expence mu&s;t be all lo&s;t; &s;ince all the kindne&s;&s;es granted by <HI>Habas,</HI> would be in|effectual, without an expre&s;s and authentick confirmation of the Reigning Prince, which would prove as difficult to obtain as the fir&s;t Decree. La&s;tly, he reflected upon the Favours and Pri|viledges which <HI>Habas</HI> had granted to the Company which he &s;erved, and by which he had been &s;ent: all which he &s;aw lo&s;t, without knowing what to hope from his Succe&s;&s;our, who&s;e Youth, and want of Experience, not under&s;tanding the Intere&s;ts of State, might ea&s;ily be &s;wayed by the bya&s;&s;ed Coun&s;els of &s;ome Grandees, who minding nothing but their particular pro|fit would advi&s;e him perhaps to what might prove to the di&s;ad|vantage of the Company.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations and reflections very much di&s;quieted the Emba&s;&s;adours Mind. But in regard it was high time to apply a Remedy to the&s;e Inconveniencies, he advi&s;ed with tho&s;e per&s;ons that were of his Council, and having examined the pre&s;ent Conjuncture, he re&s;olved as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ibly he could to go and ki&s;s the New Kings Feet, to the end he might prevent the re&s;t of the <HI>Europeans,</HI> by having the honour to &s;ee the
<PB N="63" REF="252">
New King before them; and then to try whether he could obtain a Confirmation of all the Priviledges granted by his Pre|dece&s;&s;ours to the Company and the <HI>Holland</HI> Nation.</P>
<P>This Re&s;olution taken, the Emba&s;&s;adour &s;ent after Dinner the Interpreter belonging to the Dutch <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> in <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> to the <HI>General</HI> of the <HI>Mu&s;quetteers,</HI> the only per&s;on that could at that time procure his Audience, in regard he was the only Per&s;on upon whom the New King relied, for what he &s;hould do or &s;ay in matters of State. The Interpreters In&s;tructions were, <Q>That after he had mo&s;t humbly &s;aluted the General in the Name of the Emba&s;&s;adour, he &s;hould be&s;eech him earne&s;tly to repre&s;ent to his Maje&s;ty the Splendour, Reputation, and Power of the noble Company (tho&s;e were terms he u&s;ed) which his Maje&s;ty had all the rea&s;on to gratifie to his utmo&s;t, in regard of the great Trade which they drove in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Dominions. Moreover, to let him under&s;tand how highly the &s;aid Com|pany was e&s;teemed by his Predece&s;&s;ours, <HI>Habas</HI> the Great of glorious Memory, <HI>Sephie</HI> the Fir&s;t, <HI>Habas</HI> the Second, who had granted them particular favours, and always honoured them with their Protection. That not long &s;ince, the <HI>Council</HI> of <HI>Batavia</HI> in acknowledgment of the generous Affection which the Monarchs of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> had from time to time te&s;tified for them, they had deputed to ki&s;s the fear of the King now gone to Heaven the <HI>Heer Hubert de Laire&s;s</HI> with con&s;iderable Pre&s;ents. That the &s;aid Emba&s;&s;adour had been well re|ceived by the &s;aid Monarch, who had not refu&s;ed him any thing which he reque&s;ted: and that the &s;ame Emba&s;&s;adour after &s;o favourable a di&s;patch, being ju&s;t ready to return, had re|ceived the News of the King his Fathers death, and of his advancement to the Throne.</Q></P>
<P><Q>That thereupon he had re&s;olved not to leave the Kingdom, before he had had the honour to ki&s;s his Maje&s;ties Feet, and to appear before him with that humility which became him. And that he had not any Pre&s;ents worthy his acceptance, be|cau&s;e he had made an offering of all that he brought along with him to the decea&s;ed King of glorious Memory, to whom his mo&s;t Illu&s;trious Maje&s;ty was now Succe&s;&s;our, and his Prime Mini&s;ters of State, and therefore he hoped his Ma|je&s;ty would be &s;o indulgent as to excu&s;e him, and permit him the honour which he with all humility reque&s;ted. La&s;t|ly, That he &s;hould be&s;eech the General of the Mu&s;quetteers to u&s;e his Intere&s;t to obtain leave for him with the &s;oone&s;t that he could, to the end he might pre&s;ent him&s;elf at the feet of
<PB N="64" REF="253">
the new Monarch, and be favoured with a quick di&s;patch; In regard the death of the Director his Predece&s;&s;our, and &s;e|veral other weighty Affairs called him away in ha&s;te to the <HI>Port</HI> of <HI>Habas.</HI> That if he would give him&s;elf the trouble to procure that Audience the next day, he would promi&s;e him a becoming Acknowledgment, a&s;&s;uring him that the Company would always be ready to remunerate his favour, and be for ever obliged to his kindne&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>With the&s;e In&s;tructions the Interpreter went to the <HI>General of the Mu&s;quetteers,</HI> and having the opportunity to &s;peak to him in private by him&s;elf, laid before him all his &s;pecious Arguments according to his directions. But while he had no other di&s;|cour&s;e but plau&s;ible pretences and excu&s;es, they made no Im|pre&s;&s;ion upon the covetous Warriour, who pretending igno|rance, or perhaps becau&s;e he was really ignorant of tho&s;e affairs, made an&s;wer that he could determine nothing po&s;itive in tho&s;e matters, and therefore he mu&s;t be content to &s;tay till the Court returned to <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI></P>
<P>But when the Interpreter began to add to his Rea&s;ons the Pro|mi&s;e of a becoming Acknowledgment, the Lu&s;tre of Gold ca&s;t &s;uch a powerful reflection upon his Lordly &s;en&s;es, that he pre|&s;ently found him&s;elf in&s;pired with a new acce&s;s of knowledge and under&s;tanding; &s;o that there was not any one &s;cruple that interrupted his performance. He conde&s;cended to the Em|ba&s;&s;adours Reque&s;t, and knew &s;o well how to manage his bu&s;ine&s;s, that in the Evening he &s;ent for the &s;ame Interpreter, and gave him Order to promi&s;e his Ma&s;ter, in his Maje&s;ties Name, that he &s;hould be admitted to morrow about ten in the Morning to ki&s;s his Maje&s;ties Feet.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day at the time appointed, the Dutch Emba&s;&s;a|dour, with two more of the Company, the chief Factor of <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> and the Secretary of the Emba&s;&s;ie, together with the Interpreter attended at the Palace in an Apartment next to that where the King was Crowned. Where he had &s;taid but a few Minutes before he had notice to advance forward to the Place where the King tarried: whither &s;o &s;oon as he was come with all his Train, the General of the Mu&s;quetteers, who &s;upplied the Office of <HI>Grand Porter,</HI> or Ma&s;ter of the Ceremonies, con|ducted him from the Door of the great Hall before his Maje|&s;ty, at the di&s;tance of two Paces from whom, the Emba&s;&s;a|dour and the two other Per&s;ons with him made their Obey&s;ances according to the Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> which is to ki&s;s the ground three times before his Maje&s;ties Feet.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="253">
When they had made their Reverence, and were permitted to &s;it, the Emba&s;&s;adour by his Interpreter began with the Prayers and Wi&s;hes of Governour General of <HI>Batavia</HI> for the honour and pro&s;perity of his Maje&s;ty upon his happy coming to the Crown. For which the King returned him Thanks, and added at the Conclu&s;ion, <HI>My Lord Emba&s;&s;adour is welcome, and if he have any favour to reque&s;t, let him only make it known.</HI> Thereupon the Dutch Emba&s;&s;adour took an occa&s;ion to proceed, and gave the King to under&s;tand in few words, the Priviledges which his Ance&s;tors had all along granted to the Company; from the fir&s;t time that they came to re&s;ide in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> till that day, re|que&s;ting the &s;ame Protection from his Maje&s;ty; an Authen|tick Confirmation of all the Agreements and Decrees already made in favour of the Company, and a continuation of the &s;ame Kindne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty replied, <HI>My Lord Emba&s;&s;adour, I take you for my Gue&s;t and Friend, as al&s;o all of your Nation; and I will redouble the favours and kindne&s;&s;es which my Ance&s;tors of glorious memory have done your Company.</HI> Upon which the Dutch Emba&s;&s;adour made a profound Reverence, as did al&s;o the other two that accom|panied him, and replied to the King's obliging words in this manner, <HI>We will no farther doubt it than from the Grace and Genero&s;ity of &s;o great a Prince. On the other &s;ide if We or the Company may be any way &s;erviceable to &s;erve your Maje&s;ty, your Maje&s;ty &s;hall no &s;ooner Command but be obeyed. In the mean time we humbly beg of Your Maje&s;ty that we may have leave to retire to the Port of Habas, there to look after our Affairs, to which Importunate Nece&s;&s;ity calls Us.</HI></P>
<P>Thereupon, the <HI>General of the Mu&s;quetteers,</HI> declaring the Kings plea&s;ure (for he performs the &s;ame Office, in Grandeur, near his Maje&s;ty, which the Emba&s;&s;adours Interpreter &s;upplies out of nece&s;&s;ity) <HI>His Maje&s;ty,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>de&s;ires to know wherefore my Lord Emba&s;&s;adour di&s;covers &s;o much eagerne&s;s to be gone.

<P>To which the Dutch replied, as they had done already, bow|ing their Heads and their Bodies with a profound Humility, and returning his Maje&s;ty their mo&s;t hearty Thanks, be&s;eeching him withal to have the &s;ame gracious Opinion as before; but that for the pre&s;ent, the greate&s;t Favour he could receive at their hands, was his Royal Licen&s;e to return to their principal Factory, whither Affairs of Concernment called them. The King
<PB N="66" REF="254">
thereupon with a Nod of his Head conde&s;cended to their Re|que&s;t; and withal, ordered this farther Complement to be put upon them, <HI>That he would not &s;tay them any longer, but that they might go in the Name of God; de&s;iring to a&s;&s;ure the Company of his Affection, and that whatever they had for the future to demand, they &s;hould but ask and have.</HI></P>
<P>Tho&s;e la&s;t words included his la&s;t leave, which they al&s;o took, with mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Obey&s;ances after the <HI>European</HI> man|ner, the mo&s;t re&s;pectful that could be imagined. And thus they retired after an Audience of three quarters of an Hour. About Four in the Afternoon, they &s;ent their Interpreter to the General of the Mu&s;quetteers to return him Thanks for the Trouble he had given him&s;elf, in procuring them &s;o favourable an Audi|ence, and for the continuance of his kindne&s;s they be&s;ought him to accept as a pledge of their farther acknowledgment a Silver Watch, and fifty Ducats of Gold.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h Agent in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> Sir <HI>Stephen Flowre,</HI> under&s;tand|ing that the Dutch had had Audience of his Maje&s;ty, was not a little &s;urpri&s;ed, but much more vexed to &s;ee him&s;elf prevented; and therefore he was no le&s;s importunate to have his; and therefore, to the end he might be admitted to ki&s;s the Kings Feet, he took the &s;ame way and method which the Dutch Em|ba&s;&s;adour had done: for indeed there was no other way: and had therefore the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s. For two days after, being accompanied with his Second in the Factory, about Nine of the Clock in the Morning he was introduced by the <HI>General of the Mu&s;quetteers</HI> to make his Obey&s;ance to the King; his Interpreter and his Collegue coming behind him. After the u&s;ual Cere|monies he pre&s;ented the Prince with two hundred half Guineys, according to the &s;elf-intere&s;ted Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> where the Kings &s;tiling them&s;elves Gods Lieutenants, forbid all People to appear in their Pre&s;ence without an Offering. Pre&s;ently he &s;ate down by the Command of the Prince, and by his Interpreter, and in the behalf of the Engli&s;h Nation and Company, wi&s;hed him a long and flouri&s;hing Reign. Afterwards he made a &s;hort rehear&s;al of the great Services which the Engli&s;h Nation had done the Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> his Ance&s;tors of Immortal memory. For which rea&s;on tho&s;e Triumphant Monarchs had always fa|voured the Engli&s;h Nation more than any other Nation of <HI>Eu|rope,</HI> of which he was a&s;&s;ured his Maje&s;ty was well informed; for which rea&s;on he hoped that his Maje&s;ty would continue the &s;ame favours to the Engli&s;h Nation, and grant them a Confirma|tion of all the Treaties and Priviledges which had been granted formerly to the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="254">
To which the King returned the &s;ame an&s;wer which he had done to the Dutch Envoy. <HI>Mr. Agent is my Gue&s;t, and all the Engli&s;h Nation are mo&s;t dear to me. Whatever my Predece&s;&s;ours of Glorious Memory have granted to your Company I &s;hall al&s;o confirm. And if you have any thing farther to reque&s;t of Me for the advantage of your Nation, you may confidently propo&s;e it, and it &s;hall be decreed if rea&s;onable.</HI> To which the Agent and his Second returned their humble Thanks, as well for their Ma&s;ter as them&s;elves; be&s;eeching his Maje&s;ty to accept of their Services. To which his Maje&s;ty conde&s;cended with a Nod of his Head, which was al&s;o a &s;ign of his taking Leave; which they al&s;o took, making their Obey&s;ances after their own manner. Now in regard they were beholden to the General of the Mu&s;quetteers for this fa|vourable Audience; in regard the King did nothing without his Advice, therefore they &s;ent their Interpreter in the Evening, to give him thanks for the favour he had procured them; in ac|knowledgment whereof they made him a Pre&s;ent of a Rich Jewel, and thirty Ducats of Gold.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day the <HI>Meehmandar-Bachi,</HI> or Chief of tho&s;e that attend upon the Kings Gue&s;ts, or Strangers of Quality, who is as it were a Grand Ma&s;ter of the Ceremonies, came to wait upon the King, di&s;patched from the Grandees of the Kingdom to give his Maje&s;ty notice, that they came forward, making ea&s;ie Journeys with the Body of the decea&s;ed King, and the whole Body of the Court in his time. That to prevent the People from &s;u&s;pecting any thing of Fatal, they had given out that the King was with his Wives, and would not there|fore &s;hew him&s;elf: that neverthele&s;s the Rumour of his Death began to fly abroad; which however could not now be much prejudicial, &s;eeing that his Maje&s;ty had taken the Government of the Kingdom into his own hands: that as yet they pre|&s;erved all things in the &s;ame condition they were in before; and expected with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion what Orders his Maje&s;ty would be plea&s;ed to &s;end for their future proceeding.</P>
<P>Together with this Deputy there came an Eunuch al&s;o &s;ent by <HI>Hamzeh-Mirza</HI> the Kings Brother, to &s;alute his Maje&s;ty in the name of the young Prince, to throw him&s;elf at his Feet, to beg his favour, and to &s;upplicate him by all that was Sacred in the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Law not to put out his Eyes; That he would be plea&s;ed to &s;hut up him as clo&s;e as he thought fit, that he would take from him whatever he plea&s;ed, but that for the Law of God he would leave him his &s;ight, that he might not be inca|pable of applying him&s;elf to his Studies, wherein he re&s;olved
<PB N="68" REF="255">
to &s;pend his whole Life. The King kept the Eunuch with him|&s;elf, re&s;erving the an&s;wer to the young Prince's reque&s;t till he &s;hould be brought to Court. But he returned an An&s;wer the &s;ame day to the Letter which the Ma&s;ter of the Ceremonies brought, which was compo&s;ed in the form of a Command, and contained the following In&s;tructions.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the King approved what had been done, from the Fatal Moment of the King his Fathers death.</P>
<P N="2">2. That they &s;hould make all the ha&s;t they could to him without di&s;turbing the Order of Affairs; leaving all things in the &s;ame condition wherein they were.</P>
<P N="3">3. That they &s;hould take care to cau&s;e the <HI>Body of his de|cea&s;ed Father, of high and Immortal Memory, who&s;e place is in Pa|radi&s;e, to be carried to the City of Kom,</HI> under the charge of <HI>Mirzah-Maa&s;&s;oum;</HI> and that at the &s;ame time they &s;hould &s;end away three other Coffins like that wherein they had put the King, under as good a Convoy, one to <HI>Metched,</HI> another to <HI>Ardevil,</HI> and the third to <HI>Kachan.</HI> For the better under&s;tanding the rea&s;on of which Command, the Reader is to know, that the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> are &s;trangely &s;uper&s;titious about the Burial of their Kings. For fearing le&s;t by &s;ome Magical Art any Enchant|ments &s;hould be practi&s;ed upon their Bodies to the prejudice of their Children, they conceal, as much as in them lies, the real Place of Interment.</P>
<P>To this end they &s;end to &s;everal Places &s;everal Coffins of Lead, with others of Wood, which they call <HI>Taboat,</HI> and bury all alike with the &s;ame Magnificence. In this manner they de|lude the Curio&s;ity of the People, who cannot di&s;cern by the out&s;ide in which of the Coffins the real body &s;hould be. Not but it might be di&s;covered by &s;uch as would put them&s;elves to the expence and trouble of doing it. And thus it &s;hall be re|lated in the Life of <HI>Habas</HI> the Great, that twelve of the&s;e Coffins were conveyed to twelve of the principal Mo&s;ques, not for the &s;ake of their Riches, but of the Per&s;on which they en|clo&s;ed; and yet no body knew in which of the twelve the Kings Body was laid, tho the common Belief is, that it was depo&s;ited at <HI>Ardevil.</HI></P>
<P>It is al&s;o &s;aid in the Life of <HI>Sefi&egrave;</HI> I. That there were three Coffins carried to three &s;everal Places, as if there had been a Triple Production from one Body, tho it were a thing almo&s;t certainly known, that the Coffin where the Body was laid, was carried to this &s;ame City of <HI>Kom,</HI> and to the &s;ame Place where the decea&s;ed King commanded the Body of his decea&s;ed Father to be carried.</P>

It is a very beautiful City, and for its Antiquity gives way to none of the re&s;t; as being thought to be the <HI>Guriana</HI> of the Ancients.

In this Mo&s;que are to be &s;een the Tombs of the two forementioned Monarchs. The Porphyry of which they are built is overlaid with Plates of Gold, as if the Builders had &s;triven to be profu&s;e in the wa&s;t of that rich Metal. We &s;hall give you the de&s;cription of it in our <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Geography.</P>
<P>Now the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> made choice of <HI>Kom, Kachan, Metched,</HI> and <HI>Ardevil,</HI> rather than of any other Cities for the interment of their Kings, becau&s;e they believe tho&s;e Cities claim to them|&s;elves a &s;ecret and peculiar Sanctity above any of the re&s;t, by rea&s;on that the Martyrs and Men famous in their Religion have lived and been buried there. For they hold, that <HI>Kom</HI> and <HI>Ka|chan</HI> were always two &s;afe Retreats for all the true faithful in their Law, whom in the Primitive Times of <HI>Mahumeti&s;m</HI> the <HI>Arabians</HI> per&s;ecuted unju&s;tly: and therefore that the <HI>Imaans,</HI> by whom they mean their lawful Prophets and High Prie&s;ts, retired thither to &s;ecure them&s;elves from Per&s;ecution, and there died.</P>
<P>This is that which makes them believe that the&s;e Cities are holy and happy, and that in all their Contracts and Publick Writings they name the fir&s;t <HI>Dar-el-mouve-el-Din,</HI> or the <HI>Habi|tation of Per&s;ons revived in the Law;</HI> and the &s;econd, <HI>Dar-el-Moumenin,</HI> or, the <HI>Habitation of the truly faithful.</HI> And for the two other Cities <HI>Ardivilis,</HI> called <HI>Dar-el-Irkaar,</HI> or, the Habi|tation of direction. For that a great Saint, who lies buried there, was, as they &s;ay, &s;ent by God to direct men in the way of truth, and <HI>Metched</HI> is called <HI>Mouhedd&egrave;s.

In&s;omuch that they believe the Body of that per&s;on who is buried by him, is more &s;ecure of his Salvation, than if he were buried near any other Saint le&s;s con&s;iderable.

The King, who had hourly intelligence of the Advance of the <HI>Grandees</HI> of the Kingdom, under&s;tanding that they were arrived at <HI>Kachan,</HI> &s;ent an Expre&s;s with Commands to the two Chief Phy&s;icians, <HI>Mirza-Satrid,</HI> that is to &s;ay, <HI>Signior Ju&s;t;</HI> and <HI>Mirza-Kouchonk,</HI> &s;irnamed al&s;o the <HI>Little,</HI> to di&s;tingui&s;h him from his Brother, who was the chief <HI>Phy&s;ician,</HI> to retire to the Palace Royal at <HI>Kom,</HI> which joyns to the <HI>Mo&s;que,</HI> where are the Tombs of the la&s;t decea&s;ed Kings; to betake them&s;elves to the Apartments allotted for them, there to pray to God the re|mainder of their days for the Pro&s;perity of his Throne; in ac|knowledgment of his Clemency towards them, in that he in|flicted no heavier puni&s;hment upon them, than only that &s;light di&s;grace; &s;ince they had de&s;erved to lo&s;e their lives for under|&s;tanding no better to pre&s;erve the life of his Father and their Sovereign. The &s;ame Me&s;&s;enger carried al&s;o Orders to <HI>Mirza-Ma&s;&s;oon,</HI> or the <HI>Lord without Blemi&s;h,</HI> already mentioned, and the Son al&s;o of the Prime Mini&s;ter; and <HI>Moutuely</HI> of <HI>Koom,</HI> as much as to &s;ay, <HI>Ma&s;ter of the Works,</HI> and <HI>Judge of the Govern|ment,</HI> to take an Inventory of the whole E&s;tate of tho&s;e two Phy&s;icians, to give it under their Seals what they found in ready Money, and to &s;end the Inventory when they had made it up to the King. Out of which he allowed them a Revenue of twenty thou&s;and Crowns a year to live comfortably in the &s;aid City, without &s;tirring out of the Palace to which they were confined, till the Supreme Power &s;hould di&s;po&s;e of their Lives.</P>
<P>The whole Body of the Court arrived at <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> within a Week after that, which was three Weeks after the Kings Co|ronation. And then it was that the great Officers were admit|ted one after another, troubled in their minds, and with hearts laden with &s;orrow. Not one of them that knew what part to act in this new Court, where every one flattered him&s;elf with making an Intere&s;t. However &s;till as they came to Town, they went to ki&s;s the Kings Feet; and to pay him the <HI>Moubarek-Bached,</HI> which is a Cu&s;tomary term which they u&s;e when they Congratulate the Pro&s;perity of any great Per&s;on: as if we &s;hould &s;ay, <HI>Let &s;uch a thing turn to your ble&s;&s;ing.</HI></P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty, as every Grandee had paid him his Submi&s;&s;ions honoured him with a <HI>Calate,</HI> or <HI>Royal Ve&s;t.</HI> This <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> word, according to its Etymology, &s;ignifies <HI>Entire, Perfect, Ac|compli&s;hed,</HI> to &s;ignifie either the Excellency of the Habit, or the Dignity of him that wears it. For it is an infallible Mark of the particular E&s;teem which the Sovereign has for the per&s;on to
<PB N="71" REF="256">
whom he &s;ends it; and that he has free liberty to approach his Per&s;on; for when the Kingdom has changed its Lord and Ma&s;ter, the Grandees who have not received this Ve&s;t, dare not pre&s;ume to appear before the King without hazard of their Lives.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of this Cu&s;tom, the King &s;ent a very rich Ve&s;t to that courageous Eunuch, among others, who was the only per&s;on who had &s;et the Crown upon his Head. With this Pre|&s;ent he al&s;o &s;ent him a Dagger richly &s;et with Precious Stones. Immediately upon this it was believed that he would be advanced to &s;ome high Employment; but he refu&s;ed all Preferment with a generous Con&s;tancy: &s;o that of all the Employments which his Prince offered him he only accepted of the Superintendency of the Affairs relating to the Prince&s;s his Mother.</P>
<P>All the Grandees being thus arrived, the King for &s;everal days following, held a <HI>Megeles,</HI> that is, an A&s;&s;embly of his Lords, where the Lords of the Old Court met to compo&s;e a New one. The fir&s;t day every one came in his <HI>Calate,</HI> or Royal Ve&s;t which the King had be&s;towed upon them. But the <HI>Nazir</HI> or Superintendant General was not there; becau&s;e he had not been honoured with that Ve&s;t. So that when he found it was not &s;ent him again&s;t the next A&s;&s;embly, he was then per|&s;uaded he had not long to live; or at lea&s;t that he &s;hould lo&s;e his Employment; he feared that his Maje&s;ty had been informed, how that at the time of the Election he had endeavoured to pre|fer his Younger Brother. And this &s;u&s;pition of his was not al|together without ground; for that indeed &s;omething had been whi&s;pered to the King about it.</P>
<P>Therefore he thought he could not do better than go him&s;elf and pre&s;ent his Head to the King him&s;elf before any one was &s;ent to demand it: for that if he thought to pre&s;erve it by con|cealing him&s;elf, he &s;hould lo&s;e it without all hope of pardon; but if he had the courage generou&s;ly to lay it at the Princes Feet, it might &s;o happen that he might &s;ave him&s;elf; nor was he deceived: for this bold Re&s;olution gained the heart of <HI>Sephi&egrave;</HI> the Second, and wrought Compa&s;&s;ion even in his very Enemies, and tho&s;e that envied him. For being come to the A&s;&s;embly, he &s;tood upright upon the Terrace among the Croud of Officers, with his head hanging upon his Brea&s;t, and his Eyes fixed upon the ground, as if he had been a&s;hamed to &s;hew his face. This &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Po&s;ture of his moved the A&s;&s;embly to pity, &s;o that one of the Lords, who owed him no unkindne&s;s, told the King of it, and begged pardon in his behalf. The King &s;urpri&s;ed
<PB N="72" REF="257">
at the News, &s;ent the &s;ame Lord who had &s;poken to him, to demand of the Intendent General, what he did there? <HI>I come,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>to offer his Maje&s;ty the head of an Offender, and to ex|piate with my bloud the misfortune of having drawn upon me his In|dignation.</HI> Thereupon the King &s;ent him a Command to go home; where about four days after he was honoured with the Royal Ve&s;t, as the re&s;t had been, and was confirmed for the future in all the Employments which he enjoyed. I have heard from &s;everal per&s;ons of Quality, and from &s;ome of his own Kindred, that never any Head was in &s;uch a tottering condition, and that the lea&s;t word that had been let &s;lip to his prejudice had been enough to have ruined him. But his good For|tune &s;topped the mouths of his Enemies; &s;o that there was not one who either dur&s;t, or was willing to oppo&s;e him. Be|&s;ides that, the Young King who had been always bred among Women, and therefore not accu&s;tomed to bloud, was unwil|ling to put to death a per&s;on of who&s;e worth and merit he was well a&s;&s;ured. Tho perhaps another more cruel, and more ex|perienced would not have needed any In&s;tigation to &s;uch a piece of Fatal Inhumanity.</P>
<P>At the &s;itting of the third A&s;&s;embly <HI>Nicolas Claud de Lalain</HI> E&s;quire, Gentleman in ordinary to the King of <HI>France,</HI> and his Maje&s;ties Envoy to the Princes of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> was introduced, together with one of the three Deputies of the <HI>French Ea&s;t India</HI> Company, followed by the Interpreter of the Nation. Now this Deputy had been &s;ick, which was the rea&s;on why they demanded Audience no &s;ooner. For in regard that at the Grand Audience it is nece&s;&s;ary to demand the Confirmation of the Priviledges granted to the Company; Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Lalain</HI> had not power to treat of any &s;uch matter, but joyntly with the Deputy. Otherwi&s;e the re&s;pect which the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> have for the chief Nation of the World, would have procured them their Audience before any of the other <HI>Europeans.</HI> They made a Pre&s;ent to his Maje&s;ty of a Cry&s;tal Mirrour encha&s;ed in Gold, Enamelled on the back-&s;ide, and &s;et with Emeralds on the fore|part, together with a pair of Saddle Pi&s;tols, and a &s;mall Lion of Gold, embelli&s;hed with Pearls.</P>
<P>After they had made their Obey&s;ances they took their Seats by the Kings Order among the Grandees; and then being directed to draw near his Maje&s;ty, Mon&s;ieur <HI>Lalain</HI> began with all for|tunate Wi&s;hes for the Pro&s;perity of the New Monarch in the name of the King his Ma&s;ter, and in few words gave him to under&s;tand, <HI>That Habas</HI> II. <HI>his Father of glorious Memory,</HI> who&s;e

For which rea&s;on he mo&s;t humbly be&s;ought his Maje&s;ty to continue to the <HI>French</HI> Nation the former favours of his Predece&s;&s;ours, and to grant both the Nation and Company his Royal Protection. To which the King made an&s;wer by his Prime Mini&s;ter, <HI>My Lord Emba&s;&s;adour,</HI> (for the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> make no di&s;tinctions between <HI>Emba&s;&s;adours, Envoys, Agents, Re&s;idents,</HI> &amp;c. but &s;till make u&s;e of the word <HI>Heltchi,</HI> which comprehends all) <HI>the King of</HI> France <HI>is my Bro|ther, and the French Nation are my Gue&s;ts and Friends.

<P>By what has been &s;aid, it appears that there was no altera|tion of the Face of Affairs at the beginning of this New Reign; for that the King did nothing of him&s;elf, but meerly like an Engine mov'd as the Springs and Wires give it motion. Every one of the Grandees labour'd to get as near the Kings Per&s;on as he could, to in&s;inuate him&s;elf into the Kings Affecti|on, and to remove his Competitors at a di&s;tance. The mo&s;t Powerful and mo&s;t his Favourite however, at that time, was <HI>Boudak-Saultan General of the Mu&s;quetteers,</HI> who con|tinu'd &s;till his Maje&s;ties Director, for that he thought nothing well done but what he either order'd, or at lea&s;t approv'd. Next to him <HI>Gemtchid-Kaan,</HI> as al&s;o the <HI>Mehter</HI> or <HI>High-Cham|berlain,</HI> had a good &s;hare in his favour, not to &s;peak of his Mother, who in the Inner Palace ruled him as &s;he plea&s;ed her &s;elf.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>General</HI> of the <HI>Mu&s;quetteers,</HI> for the fir&s;t trial of his favour, he had procur'd him&s;elf a Commi&s;&s;ion that brought him a great Sum of Money. He had obtain'd of the King that he might &s;end out the New Patents, and Royal Ve&s;ts to all the great Officers of the Empire. To the <HI>Beckler-bekirs,</HI> who are the chief Governours, call'd by a Name that con&s;i&s;ts of two words, and &s;ignifies <HI>Lord of Lords.</HI> To the <HI>Kaans,</HI> or Governours of le&s;&s;er Provinces, call'd by a Title that &s;ignifies &s;trong; and whom the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> dignifie with the Title of <HI>Omrah,</HI> or <HI>Prince,</HI> (which is the Plural of <HI>Mir,</HI> an <HI>Arabic</HI> word, &s;ignifying the &s;ame thing.)

and this according to the Cu&s;tom of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> where the Sove|reign newly come to the Crown, &s;ends to all Per&s;ons in any Command or Employment of value a Patent or Commi&s;&s;ion which they call <HI>Ragam,</HI> and a Habit call'd <HI>Kalate.</HI> Which two things a&s;certain him that he is continu'd in his Employ|ment. So that when they appear in Publick thus habi|ted, the People al&s;o know that they are confirm'd in their Authority.</P>
<P>This Commi&s;&s;ion va&s;tly enrich'd the Coffers of this great Lord, in regard that every Officer and Governour to whom he &s;ends &s;uch a Patent and Ve&s;t, &s;ends a very con&s;iderable Pre&s;ent according to the Cu&s;tom of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> But it was the ruine of his Fortune and his Family, as we &s;hall by and by declare; in re|gard he made an ill u&s;e of his Power: For that he &s;ent tho&s;e Royal Habits more &s;umptuous, or le&s;s co&s;tly, not according to the Rank of the Per&s;on, and Dignity of the Employment which every one held, but according to the friend&s;hip and kind|ne&s;s which he had for them him&s;elf. And thus he dealt by the <HI>Vazier</HI> or Farmer of the Province of <HI>Mazenderan,</HI> to whom he &s;ent a Ve&s;t of little value, becau&s;e he had an Enmity again&s;t him; not only to be reveng'd of him by that affront, but becau&s;e he believ'd the indignity and vexation to be &s;o &s;lighted would tran&s;port his Enemy to &s;ome other Act that would promote his ruine, which was the only thing that he mo&s;t cordially wi&s;h'd for: and thus it fell out.</P>
<P>This <HI>Vazier</HI> of <HI>Mazenderan,</HI> call'd <HI>Mirza-Hachem,</HI> during the Reign of <HI>Habas</HI> II. was in good credit with his Prince. And yet there was not in all <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> a per&s;on of a more &s;candalous Tongue. He would talk of the <HI>Grandees</HI> to the King with a mo&s;t dreadful &s;awcine&s;s; call the Prime Mini&s;ter, Buffle-Head; the <HI>Superintendant,</HI> a Liar; the Chief Ju&s;tice, downright Knave; and then for the <HI>General of the Mu&s;quetteers,</HI> he &s;aid, he was both a Coward and a Robber. And tho <HI>Habas</HI> gave little heed to his di&s;cour&s;e; neverthele&s;s the per&s;ons concern'd, were afraid they &s;hould make an impre&s;&s;ion in the King's mind to their di&s;advantage, and therefore they all hated him with a perfect hatred.</P>
<P>But now, the King his &s;upporter being dead, the <HI>General of the Mu&s;quetteers,</HI> who was become the New Kings chief Favou|rite, and had obtain'd a Commi&s;&s;ion to &s;end all the Officers their Royal Habits, re&s;olv'd to be reveng'd, as believing withal that it would be no le&s;s acceptable to the re&s;t of the Lords.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="258">
To this purpo&s;e in&s;tead of a Royal <HI>Calate,</HI> he only &s;ent him a plain Habit, worth not above forty Pounds, not doubting but that the <HI>Vazier</HI> would commit &s;ome extravagance that would ha&s;ten his de&s;truction. Nor did he fail in his Conjecture. For upon his going forth to meet and receive the Habit, and to put it on that the People might &s;ee, that he was con|firm'd in his Employment, when he &s;aw it, and found it to be a thing of no value, he threw it away with &s;corn and in|dignation, believing it to be a trick put upon him, and done on purpo&s;e to di&s;grace him. However his di&s;dain carri'd him no farther; for he conjectur'd it to be &s;ome &s;nare laid to hurle him headlong into Ruine. Not daring therefore to return to the City in that <HI>Habit,</HI> and fearing lea&s;t the People &s;hould de|&s;pi&s;e him, if they &s;aw him &s;o ill dre&s;s'd at the Kings Expence, as one that had lo&s;t his Reputation at Court, he &s;ent home for a <HI>Royal Habit,</HI> one of the Riche&s;t and mo&s;t Magnificent that <HI>Habas</HI> had formerly be&s;tow'd upon him, and &s;o having put it on, he return'd to the City, making the People believe that he had receiv'd it from the New Monarch.</P>
<P>This being known to all the Court, the <HI>General of the Mu&s;|quetteers</HI> was the fir&s;t that open'd his Lips, declaring that the <HI>Vazier</HI> of <HI>Makenderan was a Dog,</HI> that he had thrown away the Kings Habit, with reproachful Language, not forbearing to &s;ay that he had no need of <HI>Sha-Sefi&egrave;'s</HI> Habits; whereupon he had made u&s;e of another which <HI>Habas</HI> his Father had &s;ent him. The King who under&s;tood not the Stratagems of Court, look'd no farther then the bare Information, not dreaming of any malice in the Contrivance. And therefore upon the Prime Mini&s;ter's fir&s;t motion, he &s;ent an expre&s;s Command to the <HI>Vazier's</HI> Controller to appear at Court. So &s;oon as the <HI>Vazier</HI> under|&s;tood that the <HI>Controller</HI> was &s;ent for, he began to con&s;ider the bad condition of his affairs. He knew well, and upon good grounds, that the Controller was a per&s;on that would not &s;pare to inform the wor&s;t he could again&s;t him, becau&s;e they had been at variance a long time. <HI>Habas</HI> the Second had joyn'd them both together in Commi&s;&s;ion of &s;et purpo&s;e, to the end that through the mi&s;tru&s;t that they had one of another, they might be the more careful how they demean'd them&s;elves in the di&s;|charge of their duties; and to prevent them from any combi|nation to defraud him of his Revenues. The <HI>Vazier</HI> therefore, to prevent his Fall as much as in him lay, di&s;patch'd away, be|fore the Controller &s;et forward, one of his own Servants with Letters to his <HI>Vikil</HI> or Agent at Court, wherein he gave him
<PB N="76" REF="259">
order to &s;pare for no expence in con&s;iderable Pre&s;ents to &s;uch and &s;uch Lords. <HI>But,</HI> added he at the bottom, <HI>beware of offering any thing to that Ra&s;cal of a Prime Mini&s;ter, or to that Dog of a General of the Mu&s;quetteers;</HI> withal naming &s;ome others to whom he forbad him to make any addre&s;&s;es. But by mi&s;|fortune the Me&s;&s;enger crippl'd him&s;elf by the way, &s;o that he could not make that ha&s;t which was requi&s;ite; by which accident the <HI>Controller,</HI> who follow'd him clo&s;e at the heels, overtook him in a <HI>Caravan&s;eray,</HI> or publick Inn; where finding him laid down, and fa&s;t a&s;leep, he would not mi&s;s &s;o favourable an opportunity, but &s;tole from under his Head the Pur&s;e wherein his Letters were. He read them, and carri'd them to Court, to &s;hew them to tho&s;e per&s;ons whom they had &s;o highly abus'd. Who more enrag'd then before carri'd the Controller to his Maje&s;ty, before whom he confirm'd the Information which had been already given him, That the <HI>Vazier</HI> of <HI>Mazenderan</HI> had di&s;|dainfully flung away the Royal Habit which his Maje&s;ty had &s;ent him, &s;aying withal the&s;e words, <HI>I have no need of Sha-Sephi&egrave;'s Habits,</HI> and that he &s;ent for one of <HI>Habas</HI>'s Ve&s;tments, which he wore upon his return to the City. Upon which the King highly incens'd, &s;everal times repeated the words <HI>Gidi,</HI> and <HI>Segh</HI> or <HI>Dog,</HI> and <HI>Scoundrel;</HI> with &s;everal other more outrage|ous and bitter Expre&s;&s;ions, u&s;ual among the greate&s;t Per&s;onages in that Country, who think it no &s;hame to utter them upon all occa&s;ions, and before any per&s;ons what&s;oever. Pre&s;ently the King &s;ent to arre&s;t the <HI>Vazier's</HI> Agent, and at the &s;ame time di&s;patch'd to his Ma&s;ter a <HI>Chapar</HI> or Courrier extraordinary to arre&s;t him, and confi&s;cate all his Goods.</P>
<P>The General of the Mu&s;quetteers not content with this, the next Morning inform'd the King, that this <HI>Vazier</HI> had been High Steward to <HI>Imaan-Kouli-Kaan,</HI> that famous Prince, ho|nour'd with &s;o many Encomiums, and who is reported in the Life of <HI>Habas</HI> the Great to have wrought &s;o many Miracles, be|&s;ides that he was Captain General of all <HI>Habas</HI>'s Armies. I &s;ay, he inform'd the King that this <HI>Vazier</HI> was entru&s;ted with all <HI>Imaan-Kouli-Kaan</HI>'s Jewels, and yet he would never di&s;cover to <HI>Sefi&egrave;</HI> the I. where that Prince had hid them before he was put to death; prote&s;ting he knew nothing of the matter. Which was a vi&s;ible piece of knavery, &s;ince there could be no other per&s;on in the world who could know that &s;ecret but him&s;elf: and therefore there was no way to con&s;train him to tell the truth but by force. Which Incentives &s;o wrought upon the Young Prince that he di&s;patch'd a &s;econd Courrier with Orders
<PB N="77" REF="259">
to bring the <HI>Vazier</HI> with his Head and Feet bare, and a Chain about his Neck; and that every day they &s;hould give him forty drubs upon the &s;oles of his Feet till he confe&s;s'd where the Jewels were.</P>
<P>The Me&s;&s;engers were punctual in the Execution of the Kings Commands upon the <HI>Vazier,</HI> who not able to endure the Tor|ment, nor the hard&s;hip of the Journey, (for it was then in the depth of Winter, when all the ways were cover'd with Fro&s;t and Snow,) died, by that time he came half way, had nine days together, as old as he was, &s;uffer'd horrible totrure, &s;ted|fa&s;t in his re&s;olutions not to make any di&s;covery. His E&s;tate be|ing confi&s;cated amounted to twenty five thou&s;and <HI>Tomans</HI> which make about four hundred thou&s;and Crowns.</P>
<P>In the mean time, at <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> there was nothing but publick Rejoycing, Fea&s;ting, Hor&s;e-racing, with other Sports and Pa|&s;times of the &s;ame nature. And when day was &s;hut in, an infinite number of Lights, which they call in that Country <HI>Chiragan,</HI> were hung out all along the Streets, round about the Hou&s;es, and in the great Squares after a mo&s;t pompous man|ner, in&s;omuch that the night it &s;elf might truly be call'd an Arti|ficial day.</P>
<P>The Young King no le&s;s greedily ta&s;ted all the plea&s;ures and delight which the full &s;winge of Liberty, unknown what it meant till then, gave him opportunity to enjoy. Every day he walk'd abroad with his Wives into the parts adjoyning to the City; commanding the <HI>Kourouk</HI> through all the Villages and Towns adjoyning.</P>
<P><HI>Kourouk</HI> &s;ignifies a Prohibition to all Men and Boys above &s;even years of Age, upon forfeiture of Life, to be &s;een in any place where the Kings Wives were to pa&s;s, if he were in their Company. All the ways are hung on both &s;ides with &s;uch &s;tuff of which they make their Tents, to prevent the Women from being &s;een. And notice is given to all the Men to retire home at &s;uch an Hour; be&s;ides that, the Guards at two Leagues di&s;tance round about, were ready to prevent any one from coming near the Pla|ces &s;o canva&s;t in. Such is their fear, le&s;t the Wives &s;hould be &s;een by the Men. For they never hinder the Women from &s;eeing as much as they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, that during the five Months from the Coronation of the King till the year 1078. of the <HI>Hegira,</HI> which an&s;wers the Spring of our 1667. the King commanded no le&s;s then &s;ixty two <HI>Kourouks,</HI> going abroad with his Wives every time, and vi&s;iting the Places round about <HI>I&s;pahan:</HI> e&s;pecially <HI>Gioulfa,</HI> a
<PB N="78" REF="260">
Town belonging to the <HI>Armenians,</HI> &s;eparated from the City only by a River, over which he made &s;everal large and magni|ficent Bridges. Which &s;hews what power the Women had over the Young Prince, that they could cau&s;e him to make &s;o many Prohibitions for their &s;akes; only that they might have the plea&s;ure of hunting, and walking, and breathing in a more &s;weet and &s;pacious Air then that of their Confinement.</P>
<P>While the Young King deni'd nothing to his Wives, nor his Plea&s;ures, he neither refus'd any thing to his Favourites, nor to tho&s;e that begg'd any thing of him; in&s;omuch that many per|&s;ons that were laid a&s;ide were taken again into Favour. So that the beginning of the New Prince's Reign was like a year of Ju|bilee, that &s;ets open the Pri&s;on Doors: They that had never &s;o few friends at Court might ea&s;ily be admitted, provided none of the Grandees oppos'd their entrance.</P>
<P><HI>Mirza-Rezi</HI> or the <HI>&s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Prince</HI> was one of tho&s;e per&s;ons out of favour, and Pri&s;oners of whom we have made mention. The decea&s;ed King had confin'd him to his Palace, and had con|fi&s;cated all his E&s;tate, to the value of twelve thou&s;and pounds yearly revenue; and this, becau&s;e that although he was blind, he would a&s;&s;ume to him&s;elf the di&s;po&s;al and management of a Legacy of &s;ix thou&s;and Crowns a year, which one of his An|ce&s;tors had left to the Mo&s;quees. For the Te&s;tator having or|der'd in his Will, that this Revenue &s;hould be at the di&s;po&s;al of him that was in the Family to manage it, the per&s;on to whom the Admini&s;tration belong'd being dead, this blind Lord thought no per&s;on more capable then him&s;elf; and becau&s;e he was very potent, and of the Bloud Royal by the Mothers &s;ide, who was the Daughter of <HI>Habas</HI> the Great (which was al&s;o the rea&s;on that they put out his Eyes) he re&s;olv'd to get this Admini&s;tration by force, under pretence that he was going out of the World, and concern'd him&s;elf only about Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Affairs; and be&s;ides, had more wit then all his Family. But his Kindred coming to <HI>Habas</HI> II. and informing him that <HI>Mirza-Rezi,</HI> having had his Eyes put out by the Command of the de|cea&s;ed King his Father, on purpo&s;e to render him incapable of the Affairs of this World, neverthele&s;s went about by force, and contrary to Law, to meddle in Civil matters. The Monarch hearing this, grew impatient at his arrogance, and after he had given &s;ome &s;igns of admiration, that a blind man &s;hould think him&s;elf capable to manage &s;uch a a de&s;ign, &s;ent to confi&s;cate all his E&s;tate, and commanded him to keep him&s;elf confin'd to one &s;ingle Quarter of his
<PB N="79" REF="260">
Palace. But <HI>Sefi&egrave;</HI> the Second upon his coming to the Crown, re&s;tor'd him to his favour, and return'd him all his E&s;tate with|out the lea&s;t diminution.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t con&s;iderable who in the&s;e Halcyon days of the King's early Government were releas'd out of Pri&s;on, and admitted to return to Court was <HI>Hali-Kouli-Kaan,</HI> who had been a Pri&s;oner at <HI>Kasbin,</HI> and who with a boldne&s;s altogether &s;urprizing, having made his e&s;cape from his Guards, came and threw him&s;elf at the King's Feet. The &s;tory was this.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as he under&s;tood the News of <HI>Habas's</HI> decea&s;e, he conceiv'd great hopes of recovering his Liberty. To which purpo&s;e he con&s;ider'd with him&s;elf, by what means he might make his e&s;cape, and get to <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI> He was re&s;olv'd to beg the King's favour him&s;elf, believing that not any of the Gran|dees at Court ow'd him &s;o much kindne&s;s as to &s;peak in his behalf: only one friend he had, and that was the General of the Slaves. He, not forgetful of the ancient and &s;trict Friend|&s;hip that had been between them, ventur'd three or four times in that privacy which the King allow'd him, to repre&s;ent to his Maje&s;ty the misfortune of <HI>Hali-Kouli-Kaan;</HI> but when he &s;aw thatt the Prince return'd him no An&s;wer, he &s;ent to the Lord an account of the &s;tate of Affairs, and advis'd him to come in per&s;on, and throw him&s;elf at the King's Feet: for that con&s;i|dering the mildne&s;s and &s;weetne&s;s of the new Conjuncture he could run no great <HI>Ri&s;co.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Letters confirm'd <HI>Hali-Kouli-Kaan</HI> &s;o much the more in the Re&s;olution he had taken, becau&s;e he found him&s;elf &s;up|ported beyond his expectation. Thereupon he wrote back to the General of the Slaves, return'd him thanks for his kindne&s;s toward him, be&s;ought him to continue it, and to take care that he might have Hor&s;es laid to be ready at &s;uch places and times. And when all things were ready, he de&s;ir'd leave of the Captain of the Guard to let him go a hunting.</P>
<P>This being a favour which the Captain had granted him &s;everal times before, he did not then deny him. Thereupon he rode forth, attended only with four of his mo&s;t intimate Confidents well mounted, and well arm'd. Being got into the field, he &s;till beat toward <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> pretending to hunt, but little minding whether he put up any Game or no. But at length having drawn off his Guards a good way from the Town, and finding their Hor&s;es tir'd, toward the clo&s;e of the Evening, as if it had been only a frolick, he put Spurs to his
<PB N="80" REF="261">
Hor&s;e and rode out of &s;ight. As for his Guards they had no mi&s;tru&s;t at fir&s;t, till at length, that they &s;aw he made &s;o little ha&s;t to come back. But it was too late to pur&s;ue him, and as vain to &s;tay till he return'd; their Hor&s;es being quite tir'd with Gallop|ing up and down for four hours and more together. Be&s;ides, the re&s;olute Pri&s;oner flew with all the &s;peed that Whip and Spur could make, and arriv'd at <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> where he met all his friends at the appointed Rendezvouz, to the number of Fifty per&s;ons, and went directly to the King's Gate.</P>
<P>When he drew near the Place where the King was &s;itting, the <HI>General</HI> of the <HI>Slaves</HI> met him; who was not a little &s;urpriz'd to &s;ee him there &s;ooner then he expected. Neverthele&s;s, without making any &s;hew of having kept any corre&s;pondence together, he ask'd him his bu&s;ine&s;s, who an&s;wer'd, <HI>That he came to lay his Head at the King's Feet. It is very well done,</HI> replied the Ge|neral of the Slaves, <HI>I'll go and beg the Kings leave for your ad|mi&s;&s;ion.</HI> But <HI>Hali-Kouli-Kaan,</HI> in&s;tead of &s;taying for the Kings An&s;wer, follow'd the <HI>General</HI> of the <HI>Slaves</HI> &s;o clo&s;e that he could hear the King, as &s;oon as he heard his Name, and that he was come, make an&s;wer aloud, <HI>Kouh-Gheldy; Safa-Gheldy, Let him be welcome, let him come in a good Hour;</HI> and then com|manding him to enter, he repeated the &s;ame kind words, with a Countenance that te&s;tifi'd his &s;atisfaction; and then caus'd him to &s;it down.</P>
<P>Within a Minute after, the King call'd for him, and order'd him to draw near him; and when he was clo&s;e by him, <HI>Hali-Kouli-Kaan,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>what brings thee hither, and what is thy reque&s;t?</HI> To which the Lord made an&s;wer with a wonderful quickne&s;s of Wit, <HI>I am come hither, Benefactor of Mankind, to &s;erve your Maje&s;ty; becau&s;e Slaves and Dogs ought always to be within their Ma&s;ters call.</HI></P>
<P>This An&s;wer highly pleas'd the Youthful Sovereign, in&s;o|much that after he had di&s;mi&s;s'd him, he gave Order to the Prime Mini&s;ter to give him a &s;plendid Entertainment the next day, to provide him a Palace, and to furni&s;h him with money, and all other nece&s;&s;aries whatever.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of which Command the Prime Mini&s;ter a&s;&s;ign|ed him the Palace where lodg'd the Emba&s;&s;adour from <HI>Aurang-Zeeb</HI> King of the <HI>Indians,</HI> in the years 1664, and 1665. But this Lord, &s;o &s;oon as he became Ma&s;ter of it, pull'd it down to the ground, and built it up again far more magnificently then ever; as you may &s;ee in our <HI>De&s;cription</HI> of <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI> The next day, as he &s;ate at Dinner with the Prime Mini&s;ter, and
<PB N="81" REF="261">
was telling the Story how he made his e&s;cape out of his Con|finement, he added, <HI>That a mad Dog, the more you keep him chain'd up, the more mad and extravagant he grows;</HI> which he therefore &s;aid, in regard he had incurr'd the Kings di&s;plea&s;ure by hair|brain'd, and violent actions, and full of a Tran&s;portment that truly &s;avour'd of Extravagance.</P>
<P>A while after the King &s;ummon'd a <HI>Megel&egrave;s,</HI> or publick A&s;&s;embly for his &s;ake. There out of a magnificent humour, not u&s;ual but among Sovereign Princes, he caus'd to be &s;pread upon the ground in the Garden where this Lord was to pafs to the very Hall &s;eventy Pieces of <HI>Zer-baffe,</HI> which is a very rich &s;ort of Per&s;ian Ti&s;&s;ue, as much as to &s;ay, a <HI>Weaving of Silver.</HI> For <HI>baffen</HI> &s;ignifies <HI>to Weave or make Ti&s;&s;ue.</HI> Every Piece of this Ti&s;&s;ue might be worth eighteen <HI>Tomans,</HI> about three&s;core or three&s;core and ten pound, amounting in all to &s;ome twenty thou&s;and Crowns. Such per&s;ons as are thus honour'd by the King, walk without their Shooes upon the Stuffs, which the King afterwards &s;ends them home to their hou&s;e, for a Pre&s;ent, as he did to this Per&s;on; to whom at the end of a &s;umptuous Banquet which he gave him, he &s;poke the&s;e words, <HI>Hali-Kouli-Kaan, hearken what they are going to read.</HI></P>
<P>Upon that the Principal Secretary read a Patent, wherein the King nam'd him Governour of <HI>Cora&s;&s;in,</HI> or the ancient <HI>Bactriana</HI> of which the Capital City is <HI>Met&s;hed,</HI> which is one of the chiefe&s;t Governments in <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> But whether this Lord had heard &s;ome report of an Inva&s;ion threaten'd tho&s;e Parts, he would by no means accept the honour; or whether it were that he did not care to leave the Court, or which was more proba|ble, becau&s;e he thought it beneath him to accept of a meaner Employment then what he had before his Confinement. For he had been formerly Generali&s;&s;imo of all the Armies: and therefore after he had return'd the King his mo&s;t humble thanks, <HI>Benefactor of Mankind,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>I am old and broken with Age; Grant me the favour at the end of my life, that I may &s;pend my days at the Gate of your Maje&s;ty.</HI></P>
<P>Some few days after he offer'd him the Government of <HI>Armenia,</HI> of which <HI>Erivan</HI> is the Capital City; but with his mo&s;t humble Thanks to his Maje&s;ty he refus'd that likewi&s;e, and que&s;tionle&s;s for the &s;ame Rea&s;ons. At length the King caus'd Letters Patents to be made him to be General of all his Forces, and Governour of <HI>Media,</HI> of which <HI>Tebris,</HI> that which we call <HI>Tauris,</HI> is the Capital City; in regard that Government is always annex'd to that Employment.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="262">
But at the very time that he had receiv'd &s;o great and extra|ordinary a favour from his Maje&s;ty, he took the boldne&s;s to &s;hew that he was not yet content, but that he &s;till de&s;ir'd &s;ome|thing more. To that purpo&s;e, <HI>Benefactor to Mankind,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>&s;ince your Maje&s;ty does me the favour to call me to &s;o high a dignity, I humbly implore your Maje&s;ty to add to my Government &s;uch and &s;uch Villages, to the end I may maintain the &s;plendour of that High Rank to which your Maje&s;ty has call'd me, that when any Stranger comes to vi&s;it me, I may be able to entertain him with a Plate of Pelo</HI> (or Rice and Fle&s;h, the u&s;ual Food of the <HI>Per&s;ians) that receiving this favour at my hands, he may be more ready to joyn with me in praying for your Maje&s;ty.</HI> To which when the King had con|de&s;cended, he flung him&s;elf pro&s;trate at the Kings Feet, and gave him Thanks. As he was retiring out of the Kings pre|&s;ence, the King having &s;pi'd certain white Hairs in his Beard, which he wore up to his Ears, <HI>Hali-Kouli-Kaan,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>Go to the Trea&s;ury, and bid 'em, in my name, pay thee three hundred Tomans</HI> (which is about Eleven hundred Guineys) <HI>and buy thee &s;ome Paint to colour thy Beard, and let me &s;ee no more grey hairs in thy Face.</HI> Which immediately he did according to the Kings Order, and carried away the Money. And this was another Accumulation of Favour which his liberal Sovereign added to the re&s;t which he had be&s;tow'd upon him.</P>
<P>Thus was he made General of all the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Forces, Go|vernour of <HI>Media,</HI> and in a word, the fir&s;t and mo&s;t powerful per&s;on in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> at which all the Grandees were not a little a&s;toni&s;h'd: and they all began to grow jealous of him: even they who had been in&s;trumental to his Advancement. For they could not imagine he &s;hould arrive in &s;o &s;hort a time to that Pinacle of Honour where they beheld him. And indeed they had rea&s;on to be jealous of him. For his Authority made him Ma&s;ter of their E&s;tates; and be&s;ides, they knew him to be ill-natur'd, and mi&s;chievou&s;ly bent, and as bold and daring as a Lion; more then all this, Cholerick without re&s;pect or con&s;ideration, and re&s;olute to enterprize whatever might &s;atisfie his Fury, or advance his Intere&s;ts. From this time forward till his death, which hapned not long after, as will appear in the Series of this Story, he was always in great credit with the King; who had a particular e&s;teem for him, &s;o that there was hardly any thing which he refus'd him.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time that <HI>Haly-Kouli-Kaan</HI> was under re&s;traint the Prince&s;s <HI>Pehri-Rock&s;ar-Begum,</HI> the pre&s;ent King's Aunt was al&s;o re&s;tor'd to Favour. For, as it has been &s;aid in the Life

of the decea&s;ed Prince, who&s;e Si&s;ter &s;he was, the King, to puni&s;h her for having been too bu&s;ie in &s;ome Intrigue, which I know not what it was, only that it was &s;uch a one as had highly offended him, had married her to a <HI>Mulla Doctor of the Law,</HI> who at that time liv'd at <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> the Son of <HI>Moute-Veli,</HI> or the Steward of the great <HI>Mo&s;que</HI> at <HI>Mit&s;hed.</HI> By him during the Life of <HI>Habas</HI> &s;he had two Children, to whom the Prince for|bad her to give &s;uck, which is the manner of putting to death the Children of the Bloud Royal when the King re&s;olves they &s;hall not live. But now this Lady under&s;tanding the death of the King, went and threw her &s;elf at the feet of the New Mo|narch, who receiv'd her kindly, and a&s;&s;ur'd her he would ad|vance her Husband to &s;ome con&s;iderable Employment: where|in he was as good as his word; for &s;ome Months after, he made her Husband <HI>Sedre-Kaa&s;&s;oh,</HI> that is, <HI>peculiar Poutiff,</HI> being a very con&s;iderable Employment, as he that is as it were the Kings Almoner, or he that has the di&s;po&s;al of all the Gifts bequeath'd by the Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> to the <HI>Mo&s;ques;</HI> which Employment was worth to him about fifteen thou&s;and pounds yearly.</P>
<P>There remain'd another Si&s;ter of <HI>Habas</HI> II. in the Womens Palace, who in the Kings ab&s;ence was as it were Sovereigne&s;s of the Place; for which rea&s;on they give her a Name that &s;ig|nifies, <HI>the white Locks of the Sacred Place;</HI> which is a figurative &s;ort of Speech to denote the dignity of the per&s;on, and the par|ticular re&s;pect which is due to her.</P>
<P>This Lady, being de&s;irous to ta&s;te the Sweets of Wedlock as well as her Si&s;ter, importunately be&s;ought the New Mo|narch that &s;he might marry the Brother of her Si&s;ters Husband, a <HI>Molla,</HI> or Doctor of the Law as he was. For which rea&s;on the King made him <HI>Sedre-Mokoufaat,</HI> or <HI>Pontiff of the Kingdoms,</HI> which is a preferment almo&s;t like the other, and very near equal to it in Revenue; as he that has the di&s;po&s;al of the Le|gacies which are given to the <HI>Mo&s;ques</HI> by private Per&s;ons. Which two Preferments for above two hundred years were both in one. But the King, for the &s;atisfaction and advantage of his two Aunts, divided them for the benefit of their Husbands who are per&s;ons of no merit, and of very mean Capacities. Nor is it likely the King will &s;uffer them to hold their Places of too great Importance for their management.</P>
<P>And now his Maje&s;ty, having &s;upplied the&s;e two Pontifical preferments, which were vacant during the late Kings Reign, took care to fill up other vacancies al&s;o, which he be&s;tow'd upon per&s;ons of credit that were next about him, or their Friends.

So great, that it is reported the Employments which he &s;upply'd, and of which the King his Father had all the benefit, brought into the Chequer a Million &s;terling Yearly. However I do not report this for truth; but as having heard it affirm'd by per|&s;ons of great knowledge in Affairs, and who could have giv'n a ju&s;t account had they &s;o pleas'd; which they will not always do.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the Favours and Bounties of the Young Monarch during the Fe&s;tivals of his Coronation. Of which the mirth and jollity was not a little di&s;turb'd by a &s;ad accident that occa&s;i|on'd the downfal of the Grand Provo&s;t.</P>
<P>In the de&s;cription of <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> we have ob&s;erved that for a long time that City has been divided into two Factions, which are always quarrelling and fighting for Precedency, and An|tiquity. And upon Fe&s;tival Times there is always a great Con|cour&s;e of the Rabble of both Factions in the old <HI>Maydan,</HI> or Publick Place of the City, where the two different Factions, ranging them&s;elves, the one upon the South, the other upon the North &s;ide, batter one another with Stones and Clubs at a &s;trange rate. The Grand Provo&s;t all this while makes a &s;hew of parting 'em, but he does it &s;o remi&s;sly, that both Parties &s;ee well enough that it is only a Copy of his Countenance: which makes 'em bolder, and more violent in their mi&s;chief. For the Grand Provo&s;t is not at all troubl'd at it by rea&s;on of the great Fines which afterwards he milks into his own Pocket.</P>
<P>Upon one of the&s;e fore-mention'd Fe&s;tival days, his Maje&s;ty being in the &s;pacious and magnificent Hall, which is built over the great Portal of his Palace that looks out into the Royal Square, where he &s;ate to behold a hor&s;e Race, and &s;everal of his Lords &s;hooting at a Golden Ball, an Exerci&s;e much us'd among the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Archers, news was brought that about two thou&s;and of the Rabble were fighting in the <HI>Maydan,</HI> or Pub|lick Market place with that implacable animo&s;ity that there was like to be a great deal of mi&s;chief done. Upon which his

Maje&s;ty &s;ent for the <HI>Daroga,</HI> or Grand Provo&s;t of <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> and order'd him to take along with him a Guard of Sixty Mu&s;|quetteers if he thought fit, and go and di&s;per&s;e the furious Combatants. Which was a Command too expre&s;s to be dally'd withal. But the Grand Provo&s;t could never accom|pli&s;h it. However away he flew, at the Head of above two hundred Soldiers, and commanded the Mutineers to part and di&s;per&s;e them&s;elves. But they believing the Provo&s;t did but only make a &s;hew, as he was wont to do, fell a &s;houting at him, and palting him with &s;tones. He would fain have giv'n 'em to under&s;tand he was then in earne&s;t; but becau&s;e the Tumult and noi&s;e was &s;o great, that he could not otherwi&s;e be heard then by the thunder of his Mu&s;quets, he order'd the Soldiers to fire without Bullets; which they did, but to no purpo&s;e. For quite contrary to his expectation, the in&s;olent Multitude per|ceiving nothing but fire and &s;moke, were the more confirm'd in their Opinion, that the Grand Provo&s;t was only come there to &s;hew him&s;elf in di&s;charge of his Office, and that he did not de|&s;ire they &s;hould part in good earne&s;t.</P>
<P>In the mean time two Hor&s;emen came from the King to &s;ee if the Tumult were appeas'd; at what time the Provo&s;t, gall'd to the heart that they &s;hould ob&s;erve the little Authority he had over the Rabble, who had put him to a Retreat with their Stones, commanded about twenty of his Soldiers to fire with Bullets. Of which Volley there was not a &s;hot that mi&s;s'd. So that Nine of the Multitude were kill'd upon the place, and others were dangerou&s;ly wounded. The re&s;t, finding now that the Provo&s;t was not in je&s;t, fled with all the ha&s;t they could, leaving their dead and wounded behind.</P>
<P>When word was carri'd to the King what had happen'd, &s;ome of the Grand Provo&s;ts private Enemies, which the great Lords are never without, and who, unfortunately for him, were then at his Maje&s;ties elbow, laying hold of the opportunity, <HI>How comes it to pa&s;s, Sir,</HI> &s;aid they, <HI>that a private Per&s;on, and a Slave, dares thus abu&s;e the Inhabitants of your Capital City? Has he nothing to do but thus to de&s;troy your truly Loyal Subjects? Cannot a Grand Provo&s;t prevent the&s;e di&s;orders? 'Tis not well done to make &s;uch a &s;laughter of innocent and di&s;armed people. This will cau&s;e a contempt of the Authority which your Maje&s;ty has over your Subjects, and to lo&s;e the Re&s;pect and Reverence which they ought to bear your Maje&s;ty over all your Empire, when they find &s;uch terrible extre|mities u&s;ed under pretence of keeping 'em to obedience.</HI> Upon this the King, who of him&s;elf was already troubl'd at the Accident,
<PB N="86" REF="264">
was far more incens'd by the&s;e exa&s;perations. Wherefore he immediately di&s;mi&s;s'd the Lord from his employment, and &s;ent him Pri&s;oner to a Hou&s;e, from whence he was releas'd &s;ome few days after at the earne&s;t &s;uit of the Queen Mother, and &s;ome other per&s;ons that were concern'd at his Misfortune. For indeed he was a man of courage, eminent for his vertue, and one that &s;hew'd in all his Actions the Nobility of his Ex|traction: for he was de&s;cended from the Bloud Royal of <HI>Geor|gia,</HI> the la&s;t Sovereign Prince of that Country being his Grand|father, who&s;e name was <HI>Hemir&egrave;-Hamzeh-Mirza.</HI> We &s;hall &s;peak more of him in the Progre&s;s of his Story; fortune calling him again upon the Stage to act a part of more importance, and of greater Authority. The charge of <HI>Grand Provo&s;t</HI> was again &s;uppli'd the next day, and conferr'd upon a very worthy per&s;on, the Son of <HI>Mir-Ka&s;&s;em-bek,</HI> or <HI>Lord Prince Robu&s;t.</HI> This &s;ame <HI>Mir-Ka&s;&s;em-bek</HI> had been Grand Provo&s;t before the la&s;t that was &s;o lately put out, and in the time of <HI>Habas</HI> II. by the craft of the Prime Mini&s;ter had his Head cut off in the Royal <HI>Piazza</HI> of <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI> His Son, who was call'd <HI>Kelk-Hali-Bek,</HI> or the <HI>Lord, the Dogg of Haly,</HI> during the little time that he enjoy'd this Employment, mo&s;t worthily behav'd him&s;elf in it: and we mu&s;t needs &s;ay, that rais'd his Father made him&s;elf eminent again, by driving out all the Thieves, Pick-pockets, and Rabble which in|fected that great City.</P>
<P>This happen'd at the latter end of the Year 1077. according to the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> account, which an&s;wers to the beginning of our Year 1667. For their Year 1078. began with the <HI>Vernal Equinox,</HI> which his Maje&s;ty made a great day of publick re|joycing according to the Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI></P>
<P>But this Year that began with &s;o much rejoycing, and with &s;uch lucky Omens, was not &s;o fortunate however in the Con|clu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Scarcity, War, and Epidemick di&s;tempers afflicted the mo&s;t part of the Provinces during the whole cour&s;e of it. The Court was turmoyl'd with &s;everal di&s;orders, which co&s;t &s;ome per&s;ons many a trouble&s;om Hour. And through the negli|gence and remi&s;sne&s;s of the Sovereign, the Grandees erected &s;o many petty Tyrannies, which trampl'd under foot and pillag'd the poor people as they pleas'd them&s;elves. So that there was not any per&s;on but was &s;en&s;ible of the mi&s;eries which ill Go|vernment occa&s;ions when the Prince only minds his plea&s;ures, and to content his Pa&s;&s;ions; and the great ones following his example give them&s;elves the liberty to follow the &s;winge of their own Arbitrary Wills.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="264">
The fir&s;t thing remarkable at the beginning of the Year was the death of <HI>Mahammed-Kouli-Kaan-Divan-Beki,</HI> or <HI>Lord Chief Ju&s;tice.</HI> He neither lay long &s;ick, nor was it long before his Place was &s;uppli'd; being conferr'd upon him that was <HI>Mirr|aab,</HI> or <HI>Prince of the Waters,</HI> or Steward of the Waters: For in regard that water is very &s;carce in that Country, this &s;ame <HI>Over&s;eer</HI> of the <HI>Waters</HI> is a very con&s;iderable Employment. However it was not thought that he would be the Per&s;on made choice of to &s;ucceed the Chief Ju&s;tice, but rather that he who had formerly executed the Place, and had been bani&s;h'd by the decea&s;ed King to <HI>Met&s;hed</HI> for his ill Government would be re&s;tor'd to the Kings favour, and to his former Po&s;t. Nor was the Conjuncture without great Probability, in regard that <HI>Hali-Kouli-Kaan,</HI> General of all the Kings Forces, was then very powerful, and that the other was his Nephew, the Son of <HI>Ru&s;tan-Kaan</HI> his Brother. However he was deceiv'd, and the General, quite contrary to his Expectation, hinder'd all people to &s;ollicite in his behalf, out of the care he took of his own Reputation, which he had &s;ulli'd in a high degree, had he been in&s;trumental to re&s;tore a Per&s;on that was hated by all the world; be&s;ides that, his private enmity again&s;t him pre|vail'd beyond all the Con&s;iderations of Bloud and Con&s;angui|nity. For which the Chri&s;tians had rea&s;on to ble&s;s God, be|cau&s;e there was no man more their enrag'd and bitter Enemy then he. And it was well for 'em, during the time he held his Employment, that <HI>Habas</HI> was not a young man, and that he undertook their Protection. For it is reported of him, that when any Chri&s;tian was Cited before his Tribunal by any <HI>Ma|humetan,</HI> he pre&s;ently condemn'd him before he heard him; and that he was wont to &s;ay, <HI>It was Crime enough for an Arme|nian to have a &s;uit with a Mahumetan, for him to cau&s;e his head to be broken. Why &s;hould he not &s;uffer the Injuries that are done him, Dog as he is, that does not know that the Chri&s;tian Religion is inferiour to the Mahumetan?</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time the King held on his debaucheries every day at the &s;ame rate. But his health did not keep at the &s;ame &s;tay, while he grew every day wor&s;e then other. For the young Prince having plundg'd him&s;elf into the exce&s;&s;es of Wine and Women, it was impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould hold out without &s;ome alteration. So that during the whole cour&s;e of this Year he was always ill, what Phy&s;ick &s;oever his Phy&s;icians could pre&s;cribe him; for he took little care of him&s;elf. If he &s;ometimes refrain'd Wine by their advice, it was not &s;o long, but that he fell to drinking
<PB N="88" REF="265">
again before he had time to recover his &s;trength. For which rea&s;on he was always pale, and his Body imparted its own weakne&s;s to his Mind, and render'd him unfit for bu&s;ine&s;s to which the Grandeur of his Quality call'd him.</P>
<P>All this while the Dearth encreas'd at <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> and the poor people cry'd aloud again&s;t the exce&s;&s;ive price of it. And indeed there were many cau&s;es of this Scarcity. Fir&s;t, the la&s;t years Harve&s;t did not amount &s;carce to the half of what they ex|pected; for the Locu&s;t had devour'd the Ears. Then the whole Train of the Court was come all together of a &s;udden to <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> before they were expected, &s;o that they had tak'n no care to lay in their Stores again&s;t Winter. Moreover, at the King's fir&s;t coming to the Crown, the greate&s;t part of the Officers of the Empire coming to pre&s;ent them&s;elves before Him, and a va&s;t number of private per&s;ons crouding together about bu&s;ine&s;s, or for curio&s;ity, the Multitude of Inhabitants was encreas'd to above half as many again, &s;o that of nece&s;&s;ity the Price of Provi&s;ions mu&s;t be double in Proportion. But the chief Rea&s;on that all things were &s;o dear was the bad appearance of the Harve&s;t at hand, which promis'd no better then the la&s;t year. For in regard the Harve&s;ts in the&s;e Climates are generally reap'd in the Months of <HI>June</HI> and <HI>July,</HI> it is ea&s;ie to conjecture in <HI>March</HI> and <HI>April</HI> what the year will produce. And therefore the Corn Merchants perceiving that there would be an infallible &s;carcity of all &s;orts of Grain, enhans'd their Prizes, and would not part with what they had, but &s;taid till the Prizes were at the highe&s;t, &s;o that the probability of a dearth to come caus'd a pre&s;ent Famine. La&s;tly, the ill Government was in part a great cau&s;e of the &s;carcity, for that the Laws were not ob&s;erv'd, and the Magi&s;trates neglected their duty, without fear of being pu|ni&s;h'd. And this was the Rea&s;on that the <HI>Mochte&s;ek,</HI> or Chief of the Government, receiv'd Bribes of tho&s;e that &s;old nece&s;&s;ary Pro|vi&s;ions, and therefore to gratifie 'em he publi&s;h'd every Week the Prizes of things as tho&s;e people de&s;ir'd; that is to &s;ay, at an exce&s;&s;ive rate, and three quarters higher then in the time of the deceas'd King. For we are to ob&s;erve, that it is a Cu&s;tom in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> that every <HI>Saturday</HI> the Chief Ju&s;tice &s;ets the Price of all Provi&s;ions for the Week following, which the Sellers dare not exceed under great forfeitures. This Knavery then of the Judge of the City Government, who &s;tood in no aw of the &s;uperiour Government, was the cau&s;e that all things were &s;old at double and treble the Rate they ought to have been.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="265">
The People therefore almo&s;t &s;tarv'd by this Scarcity, re|doubl'd their Cries, &s;o that they reach'd the very Gate of the Palace Royal, which mov'd his Maje&s;ties Compa&s;&s;ion to that degree, that he committed the Affair to <HI>Ali-Kouli-Kaan,</HI> Gene|ral of all his Forces. Who began his fir&s;t endeavours of redre&s;s with an Act of Genero&s;ity and Ju&s;tice, which made him dreaded by all the Merchants and Corn-&s;ellers. He had com|manded one of the mo&s;t eminent Merchants in <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> to &s;end him in upon the place, the fir&s;t day of the Market, two hundred Sacks of Wheat, and not to &s;ell 'em at a dearer rate then they were &s;old the year before. Now the Merchant thought that he expected a Bribe; and therefore upon the Market day, think|ing to exempt him&s;elf from obedience to his Command he &s;ent him two hundred <HI>Tomans,</HI> which amount to the value of about a thou&s;and <HI>Pi&s;tols.</HI> Thereupon the <HI>Generali&s;&s;imo,</HI> being highly offended, &s;ent for him, and when he came, <HI>Dog as thou art,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>is it thus thou goe&s;t about to fami&s;h a whole City? For the Affront thou ha&s;t done me receive a hundred Drubs upon the &s;oles of thy feet.</HI> Which were paid him at the &s;ame in&s;tant; and be|&s;ides, the General condemned him in a Fine of two thou&s;and Crowns; which he took to him&s;elf, &s;ending the thou&s;and Pi&s;tols to the King.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ently he order'd a great Oven to be built in the Royal <HI>Piazza,</HI> and another in the publick <HI>Piazza,</HI> ordering the Criers to proclaim that tho&s;e Ovens were fixed to bake tho&s;e alive, that &s;hould &s;ell their bread at a rate above the &s;et price, or that &s;hould hide up their Corn. There was moreover a fire con|tinually kept in the&s;e Ovens, but no body was thrown in; be|cau&s;e no body would venture the pain of &s;uch a rigorous puni&s;hment of his Di&s;obedience.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time he al&s;o went him&s;elf to vi&s;it all the Granaries and Store-hou&s;es of Corn and Meal that were in <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> and having taken an accompt in Writing of their Number, every Week he commanded the Merchants to &s;end a certain quantity according to the Proportion of what their Store-hou&s;es contain'd, and not to &s;ell but at a certain Price, and not to deliver their goods to any but &s;uch as brought a Note under his hand. He gave the &s;ame Command for Barley: &s;o that almo&s;t for a whole years time there was neither Wheat or Barley to be had without a Ticket &s;eal'd with his Signet. All the Bakers went for &s;uch a Ticket. And in regard the General knew full well what every one of 'em vented, he would not permit the Baker by vertue of his Ticket to buy any more then what he had
<PB N="90" REF="266">
occa&s;ion for. To that purpo&s;e he prohibited the Bakers to &s;ell to any other then tho&s;e of their own Precinct, nor to &s;ell 'em any more then what was needful for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tance according to the u&s;ual rate of their &s;pending, to the end that the Bakers &s;hould not pretend that per&s;ons came from abroad to buy their bread; or that tho&s;e in their Precincts bought more one Week then they did another, and &s;o that the vent could not be always equally proportion'd. And for the Price, he order'd that the <HI>Batman-cha</HI> of Bread (the Royal weight of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of eleven pounds three quarters) &s;hould be worth an <HI>Aba&s;&s;i,</HI> which makes four Groats.</P>
<P>By this good management he wonderfully eas'd the People, who before paid for eleven pound and three fourths of Bread an <HI>Aba&s;&s;i</HI> and a quarter, or twenty pence; whence it al&s;o came to pa&s;s, that there was Plenty &s;ufficient. Thus the Complaints and Cries of the People ceas'd. For the Bakers being oblig'd to furni&s;h tho&s;e in their Precincts with as much bread as they &s;tood in need of, no body was apprehen&s;ive of the &s;carcity, but only that he paid five farthings for that which co&s;t not above four in time of plenty. And to the end that the &s;ame rate might continue, he &s;ent to all the Burroughs, Towns, and Villages, from eight to nine days journey round about, to &s;end in &s;uch a number, of Waggon-Loads of Corn and Meal to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> and there to &s;ell it at the &s;et price. By which means there came enough to &s;upply the City for &s;ix Months. More|over, when any con&s;iderable Quantity arriv'd, he order'd it to be brought in, as it were, in triumph; the People dancing be|fore with their In&s;truments of Mu&s;ick, and the hor&s;es being cover'd with Hou&s;&s;es, and gingling an infinite number of little Bells, which together with the Acclamations of the Rabble made a &s;trange, confu&s;ed, and yet plea&s;ing noi&s;e.</P>
<P>Some Villages there were that mutiny'd and refus'd to &s;end in their Corn; but the puni&s;hment of the Inhabitants of <HI>I&s;pahanim|cha</HI> &s;trook a terrour into the re&s;t. For the General had &s;ent to this Place, being a great Town con&s;i&s;ting of four thou&s;and Hou&s;es, two Leagues di&s;tant from <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> one of his Officers with a Command from the King to &s;end at the &s;et Price two hundred Sacks of Meal to the Capital City for their pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ity. The Town&s;men made an&s;wer, 'twas nothing to them if there were &s;uch a Famine in the City, for that they had paid all their duties and Impo&s;itions for the la&s;t Harve&s;t: that they had &s;omething el&s;e to do then to &s;end their Corn and their Meal to <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> Market, and that tho&s;e that wanted might
<PB N="91" REF="266">
come to them, for that they were not bound to &s;ell but in their own Town. Thereupon the Officer remon&s;trated to the Prin|cipal of the Village that it was the Kings plea&s;ure, and &s;hew'd 'em the Kings Warrant which he had in his hands; to which their an&s;wer not being with that becoming reverence which became 'em, the Officer laid his hand upon his Sword, thinking to have frighted 'em into obedience. But the Country fellows not under&s;tanding his hard words, fell upon the Officer, beat him almo&s;t blind, and tore the Kings Command, crying out, 'twas a Cheat and Counterfeit.</P>
<P>The General highly offended at this In&s;olence of the Coun|trymen, gave the King an account of it, who order'd him to inflict &s;uch puni&s;hment as the Offence de&s;erv'd. Upon which he &s;ent two hundred of his Guards, who Drubb'd to exce&s;s the Principal of the Ringleaders. He al&s;o &s;et a Fine upon their heads of a hundred thou&s;and Crowns; which was mitigated to a third part, tho after many Petitions and Submi&s;&s;ions, with a Pre&s;ent to the General of a thou&s;and Pi&s;tols, which was all paid down upon the nail.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time the General al&s;o found a way to revenge him&s;elf upon the <HI>Armenians</HI> for refu&s;ing him a kindne&s;s which he ask'd 'em; making u&s;e, for his pretence, of this Commi&s;&s;ion which the King had given him to furni&s;h <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> with Corn. The&s;e <HI>Armenians</HI> are Chri&s;tians born in <HI>I&s;pahan;</HI> &s;o call'd be|cau&s;e they are originally Natives of <HI>Armenia,</HI> from whence <HI>Habas</HI> the Great tran&s;planted 'em into the heart of the Kingdom. At pre&s;ent their principal Colony is without the Walls of the Capital City, in a place adjoyning &s;eparated from the City only by the River: the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> al&s;o call 'em, as we do, <HI>Armeni</HI> for the &s;ame rea&s;on. They al&s;o call the two <HI>Armenia's,</HI> the one <HI>Armen</HI> the Great, and the other <HI>Armen</HI> the Le&s;s. Now <HI>Hali-Kouli-Kaan</HI> at his fir&s;t coming to Court, being in want of money to put him&s;elf into an Equipage, and to go forward with his Buildings, and not knowing where to have it, one day that &s;ome of the <HI>Armenians</HI> came to him about bu&s;ine&s;s, de|manded of 'em, which were accounted the mo&s;t wealthy of all their Country-Folks? Upon which they nam'd him five or &s;ix, and among the re&s;t <HI>Koga Zachara.</HI> The General remem|ber'd his name, and two days after, when another <HI>Armenian</HI> came to pre&s;ent him &s;ome Petition or other, he ask'd him whe|ther he knew the Merchant <HI>Zachara;</HI> who making an&s;wer that he did, the General bid him go and &s;eek for him. Now the <HI>Armenian</HI> little thought that the General had meant the rich
<PB N="92" REF="267">
Merchant, which the former had mention'd, but another of the &s;ame name, who with his two Brothers manag'd the Kings Money, and had always con&s;iderable Sums i' their hands, to purcha&s;e in Foreign Countries &s;uch Curio&s;ities of value which might plea&s;e the King. This latter therefore the <HI>Armenian</HI> fetch'd. And the General believing him to be the Merchant <HI>Zachara,</HI> caus'd him to &s;it down by him for two hours toge|ther, and receiv'd him &s;o civilly as to make him &s;tay and dine with him.</P>
<P>After Dinner, <HI>Koga-Zachara,</HI> &s;aid the General, <HI>can&s;t not thou do me the kindne&s;s to lend me two hundred Tomans</HI> (which are about a thou&s;and Pi&s;tols) <HI>I expect in a &s;hort time con&s;iderable Sums of Money, and then I will repay thee with Intere&s;t, and upon any occa&s;ion thou &s;halt &s;ee I know how to be grateful to tho&s;e that oblige me.</HI> To which the <HI>Armenian</HI> repli'd, <HI>Not only two hundred, but two thou|&s;and Tomans, if your Lord&s;hip plea&s;es.</HI> This an&s;wer pleas'd the General, in&s;omuch that he &s;hew'd him&s;elf highly &s;atisfi'd, and ask'd him if he could not &s;end him in the money the &s;ame day. To which the <HI>Armenian,</HI> under&s;tanding what he had to do, repli'd, <HI>Sir,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>the money &s;hall be &s;ent in, when you plea&s;e to command it; but I mu&s;t beg the favour fir&s;t to give me the liberty to &s;peak one word. We are two Brothers and my &s;elf his Maje&s;ties Factors, the one is in the</HI> Indies, <HI>the other in</HI> Europe; <HI>as for my &s;elf, I re&s;ide here, as you &s;ee; all the Money that we turn and wind is the Kings, and then it will be requi&s;ite that the Receipt which you give me &s;hould be &s;eal'd with the Kings Signet, and then you may have the Sum you de&s;ire.</HI></P>
<P>The General then &s;aw he was mi&s;taken, for he could not meddle with the King's Money, and chafing in his mind, di&s;|mi&s;s'd the Merchant, believing the <HI>Armenians</HI> had nam'd this per&s;on to him, on purpo&s;e to baffle his reque&s;t, by putting him to de&s;ire a kindne&s;s of the King's Factor, of whom it was not proper for him to borrow Money. However it was only an Error caus'd by the mi&s;take of the Per&s;on, where there were two of a name. For in regard that the <HI>Armenians</HI> are only call'd by the Proper names which they receive in Bapti&s;m, never u&s;ing any Sirnames, it happens that there are &s;everal per&s;ons that go by one and the &s;ame Name.</P>
<P>However the General re&s;olv'd to try once more; and two days after he found an opportunity to make a &s;econd Reque&s;t. For the <HI>Keloanter,</HI> or chief and &s;ole Governour of the <HI>Armenians,</HI> and who has therefore that Title given him, which &s;ignifies <HI>Greate&s;t,</HI> having made &s;ome Pre&s;ents to the King, for which
<PB N="93" REF="267">
his Maje&s;ty &s;ent him a Royal Habit, put it on, and being at|tended by the mo&s;t con&s;iderable per&s;ons of his Nation, went to return his humble Thanks to the King, and to ki&s;s his feet. After that, according to cu&s;tom, he goes with all his Com|pany to pay his Vi&s;its to the Grandees of the Court, and to re|turn 'em his Thanks for having contributed to the Honour done him to have the Royal Ve&s;t be&s;tow'd upon him. When he came to the Generals Hou&s;e, the Grandee caus'd him and all his Company to &s;it down, and after the u&s;ual Complements, he de&s;ired 'em to lend him two hundred <HI>Tomans,</HI> a&s;&s;uring 'em that he would repay 'em again with Intere&s;t, and be their Protector upon all occa&s;ions at Court. But they, who knew how u&s;ual a thing it was for the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Grandees to be borrowing, and how frequently they were deni'd; and be&s;ides, as well under|&s;tanding the humour of the Per&s;on, to whom a Loane would have prov'd a Gift, made him an&s;wer, that it would be their happine&s;s to &s;erve him, but as at pre&s;ent their affairs &s;tood, it was impo&s;&s;ible: for that all their Money was either in the <HI>Indies,</HI> or in <HI>Europe,</HI> in the hands of their Factors, and before their return they knew not how to rai&s;e &s;uch a Sum. Very well, repli'd the General, then lend me but half &s;o much: nay, he came down at length to a third part. But the&s;e imprudent per&s;ons &s;wey'd by their own Avarice, refus'd him al&s;o that &s;mall Sum, not con&s;idering the Credit he was in at Court, and that he was able to do 'em a great deal of harm. Which &s;o incens'd the General, that he put 'em out of the Room before him, calling 'em Dogs, and turning his back upon 'em would not receive their Complement. Three Weeks after he &s;ent a Command in the Kings name to their Chief, to furni&s;h the City with forty thou&s;and <HI>Batman-Sha</HI> of Meal, which make five hundred thou&s;and pound weight. To which the Chief of the <HI>Armenians</HI> an&s;wer'd, that there was not &s;o much in all the Town: and to fetch it from other places was a thing not to be done, in regard the expence of Carriage would rai&s;e the Price of every <HI>Batman,</HI> or twelve pound, to an <HI>Aba&s;&s;i</HI> and a fourth part; which was contrary to the King's Command; who intended that the abovemention'd weight &s;hould be &s;old for an <HI>Aba&s;&s;i,</HI> which in that manner would be a fifth part lo&s;s to them. The Ac|compt was ju&s;t, and the General knew well enough they would be lo&s;ers at lea&s;t a thou&s;and Pi&s;tols in the quantity of Meal which he demanded: but that was the thing he aim'd at, that they &s;hould be lo&s;ers the full Sum of what they refus'd to lend him. And therefore, not &s;atisfi'd with their rea&s;ons, he &s;ent
<PB N="94" REF="268">
to 'em again to let 'em know that they mu&s;t furni&s;h the Quan|tity of Meal which the King had order'd; That the Place of of their Re&s;idence was a dependance upon <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> and that they were oblig'd to relieve the Capital City as well as others: and that it was his Maje&s;ties expre&s;s Command. But notwith|&s;tanding all that the General could &s;ay, the <HI>Armenians</HI> would do nothing. They pleaded that they were not oblig'd to that over-chargement; and that by their Agreement with the King they were exempt from all new Impo&s;itions and Tributes, pay|ing yearly four hundred <HI>Tomans,</HI> which come to about two thou&s;and Pi&s;tols, &s;o that altho there were a real Famine in the City, as thanks be to God there was not, there could no more then that Sum be demanded of them.</P>
<P>They were in the right, but they wanted &s;trength. The General was re&s;olv'd to carry it on with a high hand, and no le&s;s was agreed upon then to arre&s;t the Principal Heads of the Town. Of which when they had notice, they &s;ent all their Wives, to the number of above three hundred, to the Gate of the <HI>Haram,</HI> or Palace of Women, there to wait for the King, and demand Ju&s;tice. To which purpo&s;e they took their oppor|tunity when his Maje&s;ty was there, and plac'd them&s;elves be|fore the Gate again&s;t the Walls. For indeed, this is the Place allow'd to be free for all that come to cry for Ju&s;tice, or to Pe|tition for any Favour: nor dare the Guards upon pain of death hinder any Per&s;ons that offer to go thither, where they have liberty to implore with a loud voice the Ju&s;tice of the Prince. There the&s;e Women made &s;uch a noi&s;e, that they were ea&s;ily heard to the innermo&s;t part of the whole Palace, &s;o that the King having under&s;tood the Cau&s;e, commanded 'em to go home, and he would take order in their bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>However the <HI>Generali&s;&s;imo</HI> ceas'd not to pre&s;s the <HI>Armenians,</HI> and to threaten 'em with Impri&s;onment, &s;o that finding no other remedy, they &s;ent their Wives a &s;econd time to the Palace, and to the &s;ame Place. Where the Women &s;et up their throats as they did before; and under&s;tanding that his Maje&s;ty was ju&s;t coming forth at the Gate that leads into the Royal Alley, thither they ran in heaps with &s;o much fury, that one Croud of 'em got &s;o near as to touch the Kings Hor&s;e; nor could the <HI>Sophies</HI> and Lacqueys that went before, and round about the Kings Per&s;on hardly keep 'em off. For the Women in the heat of their fury began to throw &s;tones, and one among the re&s;t was &s;o impu|dent as to lay hands upon the Bridle of the Kings Hor&s;e. So that his Maje&s;ty, being before not a little &s;tartl'd at the Tumult,
<PB N="95" REF="268">
began to be more a&s;toni&s;h'd at the boldne&s;s of &s;uch an action; and be&s;ides, his Youth and want of Experience was &s;uch that he knew not how to deal with that Sex: only he commanded the Guard, to drive 'em away, bid 'em be gone, and that he would do 'em Ju&s;tice: but for all that, he had much ado to quit him&s;elf from tho&s;e &s;he Devils let loo&s;e.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time the <HI>Armenians</HI> had pre&s;ented a Petition, by means of an Eunuch, to the Queen Mother, as being under her Protection, for that their Town is one of the Places a&s;&s;ign'd for her Dowry. The Prince&s;s receiv'd their Petition, and pro|mis'd to act in their behalf. In a word, &s;o &s;oon as the Mo|narch her Son was return'd to her Apartment, &s;he be&s;ought him to remit the Surcharge which he had laid upon the poor <HI>Arme|nians</HI> in regard that by the Conce&s;&s;ions which the Kings his Pre|dece&s;&s;ors had granted to 'em upon payment of the Sum agreed, they were exempt from all other Impo&s;itions. To which the King an&s;wered, <HI>A God's name let it be &s;o, I acquit 'em.</HI> Immediate|ly the Prince&s;s di&s;patch'd away an Eunuch to give 'em notice of their di&s;charge; but the Eunuch, either through negligence, or otherwi&s;e, not meeting with tho&s;e he was &s;ent to, the <HI>Armenians</HI> knew nothing of the Kings Di&s;charge.</P>
<P>For indeed the Chief Heads of the <HI>Armenians,</HI> to the number of Forty or Fifty, ignorant of the Kings mercy, and fearing le&s;t the General &s;hould &s;end to apprehend 'em, were fled to the Grand Portal of the Kings Hou&s;e, call'd <HI>Haly-Capy,</HI> that is to &s;ay, the <HI>High-Gate,</HI> which is a Sanctuary for all tho&s;e that are pur&s;u'd by Ju&s;tice, and from whence no per&s;on can be taken without an expre&s;s Warrant from the King. Toward Evening, as his Maje&s;ty return'd from the Women's Palace to the Place where he gives his Audiences, it was told him that all the <HI>Ar|menians</HI> were got together in a riotous manner under the High Gate, and that they cri'd out again&s;t the General for threatning to impri&s;on 'em. To which the King made an&s;wer, <HI>What do tho&s;e Armenians do there? I have pardon'd 'em, and acquitted the Impo&s;ition of Meal which was laid upon 'em by Hali-Kouli-Kaan by my Order.</HI> All which the General, being pre&s;ent, heard, but &s;aid not a word, tho mad in his mind that he had mi&s;s'd his aim. Pre&s;ently &s;everal of the Officers ran with the news to the <HI>Armenians</HI> in the Gate; but blinded by their De&s;tiny, in&s;tead of going home, they thought it had been a &s;nare only to draw 'em thence, and arre&s;t 'em when they had got 'em out of the Sanctu|ary; &s;o that they would not &s;tir, till they &s;aw the King's Grace confirm'd under his Seal.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="269">
With this Re&s;olve of theirs, the &s;ame Officers return'd to the King: but then the General finding his opportunity, <HI>Sir,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>had I not rea&s;on to repre&s;ent to your Maje&s;ty as I did, that the Armenians were a company of Dogs, a rebellious &s;ort of people that &s;ubmit to your Maje&s;ty more for fear then force? Does not your Maje&s;ty &s;ee that they de&s;pi&s;e your Royal Word? Refu&s;ing to relie upon it, or to obey your Orders? But they would force your Maje&s;ty to give 'em in writing what your &s;acred Lips have pronounc'd? Was ever &s;uch a matchle&s;s piece of Impudence ever heard of?</HI></P>
<P><Q>Thou &s;peak<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t rea&s;on, repli'd the Prince; they de&s;erve my di&s;plea&s;ure, and to be puni&s;h'd. Send, and let their Guts be ripp'd up; They are Dogs.</Q></P>
<P>Upon the&s;e words the Officers were ready to execute the Mo|narchs Sentence; but the General made 'em a &s;ign to &s;tay a little. For be&s;ides that he had no de&s;ign upon their Lives, but only upon their Pur&s;es; he con&s;ider'd that &s;uch a bloudy Execution, and the lo&s;s of &s;o many indu&s;trious and under&s;tanding Mer|chants would be very prejudicial to the Kingdom; and there|fore falling upon his Knees, and imploring his Maje&s;ties Par|don in behalf of tho&s;e mi&s;erable Creatures. <HI>Sir,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>they are unworthy your Maje&s;ties di&s;plea&s;ure; Let 'em live; it will be a &s;ufficient puni&s;hment to bleed their Pur&s;es of a round Sum of Money.</HI> <Q>Well then, &s;aid the King, let their Fine be four times the value of the Meal which was demanded of 'em.</Q> Which came to fifteen thou&s;and pound &s;terling. Immediately, con|trary to any pre&s;ident that had ever been &s;een in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> the <HI>Ar|menians</HI> were hurri'd from their Sanctuary, which till then had bene always held inviolable, and committed into the hands of their Enemy, who &s;ent 'em pri&s;oners to a fair Palace for|merly belonging to the <HI>Mir-aab,</HI> or the Prince of the Wa|ters, where they had order to remain till they had paid their full Fine.</P>
<P>This Impri&s;onment made 'em look about 'em, &s;o that they petition'd the General the &s;ame day for their Relea&s;e, and that in acknowledgment of his favour they would give him the <HI>two hundred Tomans</HI> which he had formerly de&s;ir'd to borrow, and that for their Fine, they would &s;ummon the whole Town of <HI>Julfa,</HI> and cau&s;e a Contribution to be made for rai&s;ing the Sum impos'd; for that as for them&s;elves they were not able to pay it. <Q>How! cri'd the General, Dogs as they are, do they think the Sum impos'd is to be paid by any other then them|&s;elves? Do they imagine, that they who are rich &s;hall be exempt from the Burthen for the Poor to pay it? They talk
<PB N="97" REF="269">
of making the Burrough contribute, but 'tis his Maje&s;ties plea|&s;ure that the Rich &s;hall pay, and not the poor Mechanicks and &s;uch as have no Trade. The Merchants alone are able to pay a Fine of fifteen thou&s;and pounds; and therefore no more words, nor no more contending, unle&s;s they intend to have this Fine doubl'd.</Q></P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s the <HI>Armenians</HI> per&s;i&s;ted to plead their want of Money, and that it was impo&s;&s;ible for 'em to rai&s;e &s;uch a Sum. But at length there were two <HI>Indians,</HI> who whether out of their own good Nature, or whether it were at the reque&s;t of the <HI>Armenians,</HI> who went to the General, and offer'd to advance the &s;aid Sum of fifteen thou&s;and pounds for the <HI>Armenians,</HI> pro|vided they would engage to repay it with Intere&s;t, to which they agreed; and &s;o the bu&s;ine&s;s was concluded in four days; and all the re&s;t were releas'd but only the Governour, who remain|ed a Pri&s;oner &s;till for &s;ome Weeks till the whole Sum was fully paid; that is to &s;ay, four thou&s;and <HI>Tomans</HI> for the King, and five hundred to the General of the Army, which make &s;ome eighteen thou&s;and pounds. And thus you &s;ee what the&s;e People got by being wedded &s;o &s;tiffly to their own Intere&s;ts, for refu&s;ing the crafty old General the thou&s;and Crowns, which was all at fir&s;t by him de&s;ir'd.</P>
<P>This Fine &s;o con&s;iderable was not paid neither by all the <HI>Armenians,</HI> but by tho&s;e only who are call'd <HI>Giculfali.</HI> And here for his better Information, the Reader is to under&s;tand, that <HI>Giulfa,</HI> which is a part of the Suburbs of <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> is inhabited altogether by Chri&s;tians that came out of <HI>Armenia,</HI> tho not at all from one part, and therefore they are divided into two &s;orts of Colonies. Of which the Principal is the Colony of the <HI>Giulfali,</HI> &s;o call'd as being once the Inhabitants of <HI>Jiulfa</HI> a &s;mall Town in <HI>Armenia,</HI> built upon the Banks of <HI>Araxis,</HI> who built this Burrough when they were tran&s;planted to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> and gave it the name of their former Habitation. Since, and in the&s;e latter times the other <HI>Armenians,</HI> being con&s;train'd to remove from the Village where they had before &s;eated them|&s;elves at one end of <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> came and &s;ettl'd at the end of this new Town, adding new buildings to it, which make four di&s;tinct Quarters, the one call'd the Quarter of the <HI>Hirvanli,</HI> the other of the <HI>Nak&s;hivanli,</HI> as being Peopl'd by the Native Inhabitants of two Cities in <HI>Armenia, Nackchivan</HI> and <HI>Hirvan.</HI> The other two are call'd <HI>Shams-abadi, Sheik-Sabani,</HI> in regard that they who inhabit 'em formerly liv'd in the two Suburbs of <HI>I&s;pahan, Shams-abad,</HI> or the Habitation of the Sun, and <HI>Sheik-Sabana,</HI>
<PB N="98" REF="270">
 the Habitation of the <HI>Ancient Ma&s;on.</HI> Now this Fine of eighteen thou&s;and pounds was only paid by the fir&s;t; the re&s;t, again&s;t whom the General had no &s;uch Antipathy, were di&s;charg'd all together from the Impo&s;ition of Meal only for fif|teen thou&s;ands pounds weight.</P>
<P>The <HI>Guebres,</HI> who are the ancient <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> or Fire Wor&s;hip|pers, and who live at the farthe&s;t end of the Town, were wholly di&s;charged upon their pleading Poverty; it being well known that they were a mi&s;erable &s;ort of People, and under great di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>The General of the Army, within a &s;mall while after caus'd a Fine of thirty thou&s;and pounds to be paid to his Maje&s;ty, and in|deed upon a much more rational and ju&s;ter &s;core, by the <HI>Multani,</HI> who are a &s;ort of <HI>Indian Banians,</HI> &s;o call'd from <HI>Multan,</HI> one of the chief Cities of <HI>India,</HI> and the fir&s;t that lies next to <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> toward <HI>Kaud-Dar,</HI> becau&s;e the fir&s;t that frequented <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> came from that City. Now two of the&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> had Intelligence &s;everal years &s;ince with the Mini&s;ters of the <HI>Indian</HI> King, and &s;erv'd him as Spies at <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> to give him private intelligence of all the Affairs and Intrigues of the <HI>Per|&s;ian</HI> Court and Kingdom: nor did they fail to write upon all opportunities, and at that time taking hold of the opportunity of the Caravan which in the Spring time goes to the <HI>Indies,</HI> they &s;ent Letters by that Caravan, among other things, that <HI>Aureng-Zeb</HI> (for that was the <HI>Indian</HI> Monarchs name) &s;hould not let &s;lip this advantage of invading <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> That he could never de&s;ire a more favourable Conjuncture, then that which now invited him; That there was nothing to hinder his Victo|rious March even to <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> it &s;elf; for that the Prince him&s;elf was very Young, wanting both Experience and Courage: that he who bore all the &s;way under him, was an old Tyrant, the General of the Army; but in regard of his Age unfit for War; and for his other Mini&s;ters, be&s;ides that they were per&s;ons that had neither Courage nor Conduct, they were di&s;gu&s;ted with the Government. More then this, that there was a very great &s;carcity in the Country of all things nece&s;&s;ary for humane &s;up|port, e&s;pecially in the Metropolis, where there was a general murmuring again&s;t the di&s;orders and bad management of the Government; and that the general Rumours were, that <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> was attacqu'd in &s;everal places. In a word, that the <HI>Indians</HI> could never have &s;uch an opportunity to conquer the Kingdom, and retake <HI>Kand-Dar.</HI> In the&s;e Letters al&s;o were enclos'd the Portraitures of the King, and all the Principal Mini&s;ters and
<PB N="99" REF="270">
Officers of State, which tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> had prevail'd with a Painter to draw for a good Sum of Money, on purpo&s;e to &s;end to the <HI>Indian</HI> that they might be known to the Monarch of that Country.</P>
<P>This Plot was di&s;cover'd by a little Slave belonging to the Painter. For about &s;ix Weeks after the &s;etting forth of the <HI>Cara|van,</HI> his Ma&s;ter having beaten him to exce&s;s, he attempted a Revenge above his Age and Condition. He ran to the Ge|neral of the Armie's hou&s;e, and de&s;ir'd he might be admitted to &s;peak with the General in private. But the Servants at fir&s;t would not permit him with a trifle of no importance to inter|rupt the <HI>General,</HI> who had always an incredible Crowd of Peo|ple waiting upon him, and a multitude of bu&s;ine&s;s upon his hands. Till at length being importunate to &s;peak with him, and urging the weight of the &s;ecret which he had to di&s;cover, the Guards inform'd the General, who &s;ent for him into his pre&s;ence, and demanded what he would have. To whom the Slave made an&s;wer, with an undaunted courage, that it was not a &s;ecret to be di&s;cover'd, but if he pleas'd to order the People to withdraw, or to retire him&s;elf, he &s;hould know his bus'ne&s;s in private. Notwith&s;tanding all this the General at that time made little reck'ning of what he &s;aid, and they a&s;&s;ur'd me that it was three days before the General would trouble him&s;elf to examine him. Till at length the Slave per&s;evering in his re&s;o|lution never to di&s;cover any thing but to him&s;elf in private, the General mov'd by his per&s;everance, &s;ent for him into a little Ca|binet, where he di&s;cover'd that his Ma&s;ter had drawn the Por|traitures of the King and all the Grandees of the Court, and had &s;old 'em privately to the <HI>Indians</HI> to &s;end into <HI>India;</HI> that three <HI>Dervicks</HI> (&s;uch are tho&s;e that out of a Religious Motive make a profe&s;&s;ion of Poverty) carri'd tho&s;e Portraitures into <HI>India,</HI> and that they came to his Ma&s;ter with the <HI>Indians,</HI> and hid 'em under the tatter'd Garments that they wore: that they hid certain Letters al&s;o in the &s;ame manner at the &s;ame time, but of which he knew not the Contents, and that they went away with the Caravan for <HI>Caudar.</HI></P>
<P>The General of the Army was at a &s;tand whether he &s;hould give credit to the Depo&s;ition of this Slave or no. He tri'd him &s;ometimes with threats, &s;ometimes with promi&s;es to &s;ee if he could find him any way tripping or various in his &s;tory; not knowing but that it might be a fal&s;hood of the Slaves Invention. But when he found him re&s;olute in the &s;ame tale, and &s;till affirming Po&s;itively the &s;ame thing: and that he
<PB N="100" REF="271">
affirm'd it with all the Oaths which among the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> are e&s;teem'd to be mo&s;t dreadful, and that he offer'd his Life as a Gage of what he had &s;aid; the General re&s;olv'd to dive into the bottom of the Affair. Thereupon he di&s;patch'd away two Hor&s;emen after the <HI>Caravan,</HI> with a Warrant under the Kings hand to &s;eize the per&s;ons that were accus'd of carrying tho&s;e Letters and Portraitures. Which two Hor&s;emen in a months time overtook the <HI>Caravan,</HI> and knowing the <HI>Derwicks</HI> by the de&s;criptions which the Slave had giv'n, brought 'em Pri&s;oners to <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI></P>
<P>When they were brought to the General of the Army, he &s;ent for the Slave, and ask'd him if he knew tho&s;e poor people, and if they were the per&s;ons that carri'd the Letters and Portrai|tures. The Slave a&s;&s;ur'd him that they were the men, and pre&s;s'd 'em &s;o home that they began to &s;tagger in their An&s;wers. Thereupon the General caus'd their Cloaths to be &s;earch'd, and their Tatters to be unripp'd, and there, as the Slave had declar'd, he found the Portraitures and the Letters &s;owd up in &s;everal places. All which were carri'd to the King, who having &s;een the Contents of the Letters fell into &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ionate Rage, that he re&s;olv'd to put to death one part of the <HI>Multani Indians,</HI> and to exterminate the re&s;t out of his Dominions, tho they were above twenty thou&s;and. But the <HI>Generali&s;&s;imo,</HI> and the Chief Mini&s;ter endeavour'd to appea&s;e him, and humbly repre&s;ented to him, that it was not rea&s;on to puni&s;h the Innocent with the Guilty. In the mean time they could not make any di&s;coveries of the Authors of the Letters; for the <HI>Derwicks,</HI> notwith&s;tand|ing all the Torments and Tortures they were put to, would di&s;cover nothing: con&s;tantly affirming, that they knew not who they were, nor their names, nor had ever been at their Hou&s;es. That as for what had been found about 'em, they met with tho&s;e things in their Bundles at the Painters, and that the Indians that brought 'em, never told them either their Names, or their Habitations.</P>
<P>Now in regard their Names were not &s;ub&s;crib'd in the Letters, the General knew not what cour&s;e to take to &s;ift out the truth. He had caus'd the Principal of the <HI>Multani</HI> to be apprehended, to the number of two hundred, but they were all releas'd again except three, who paid for tho&s;e that were guilty, if they them&s;elves were not the very per&s;ons, (for it never could be made out, and the &s;u&s;pitions were very &s;light) and therefore being thus in the dark, it was thought &s;ufficient to confi&s;cate a part of &s;o much of their E&s;tates as they could di&s;cover, which
<PB N="101" REF="271">
they found to amount to va&s;t Sums; of which neverthele&s;s, out of meer pity they took no more then eight Thou&s;and <HI>To|mans,</HI> or thirty thou&s;and pounds: The re&s;t was left 'em upon their pleading that what &s;eem'd to be theirs, belong'd to Mer|chants that liv'd in the <HI>Indies.</HI> As for the three per&s;ons that carri'd the Letters and Portraitures, and the Painter, they were drubb'd with a witne&s;s; nor were they releas'd till their Feet were &s;well'd as big as their Heads with the violence of the blows.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time <HI>Sha-Naavaz-Kaan,</HI> Prince Governour of <HI>Georgia,</HI> &s;ent his Son to the Court of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> to de&s;ire the King to be&s;tow upon him the Employment of <HI>Daroga,</HI> or grand Pro|vo&s;t of <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> which appertain'd to him of right, according to former agreements between the Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and the Princes of <HI>Georgia.</HI> To which demand his Maje&s;ty was very unwilling to conde&s;cend, becau&s;e he had already given away the Place: but his Mini&s;ters of State acknowledging the ju&s;tne&s;s of his claim, &s;pake &s;o effectually to the King, that the <HI>Geor|gian</HI> was inve&s;ted in the Employment, and <HI>Kelb-Haly-Bek</HI> was order'd to re&s;ign, who was recompens'd with an Employment altogether as con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>For the better under&s;tanding of which pa&s;&s;age we mu&s;t ob|&s;erve, that when <HI>Habas</HI> the <HI>Great</HI> became the Ma&s;ter of <HI>Georgia</HI> (which he obtain'd rather by &s;light then by force.) by tho&s;e &s;nares into which he drew poor <HI>Temuraz-Kaan,</HI> who was the la&s;t King of <HI>Georgia;</HI> he propos'd to him great advantages, provided he would &s;ubmit him&s;elf to his Empire, and acknowledge his So|vereignty; and among the re&s;t that the Employment of Grand Provo&s;t of <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> &s;hould for the future belong to one of the Children of the Prince of <HI>Georgia,</HI> and that it &s;hould de&s;cend by inheritance to his Succe&s;&s;ors to perpetuity. Which has been faithfully all along ob&s;erv'd to this time, and the Son of the Prince of <HI>Georgia</HI> always hol'ds that Employment.</P>
<P>A third Vacancy was al&s;o &s;uppli'd, that is to &s;ay, the Go|vernment of <HI>Shamaky,</HI> which encompa&s;&s;es one part of the Southern <HI>Media,</HI> and another of <HI>Hyrcania.</HI> And this was giv'n to <HI>Sepher-Kouli-Kaan,</HI> or the Princely Slave of the Armies. It became vacant by the Death of <HI>Negef-Kouli-Kaan,</HI> one of the brave&s;t Lords of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> generous and &s;tout, who by his Re|&s;olution and Courage had rais'd him&s;elf to that high Dignity. The <HI>European</HI> Merchants trading in Jewels have often ta&s;ted of his generous Liberality; for he did not only &s;atisfie 'em for their Jewels, but carre&s;s'd 'em with Habits, Pre&s;ents, and good Chear.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="272">
During the&s;e Tran&s;actions in the Capital City of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> the Frontiers were greatly apprehen&s;ive of a War, that threaten'd 'em from all parts. Courriers came thick and threefold to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> &s;ome from the Confines of <HI>Bactria, Hyrcania,</HI> and <HI>Media,</HI> who brought intelligence of &s;everal de&s;igns which the <HI>Ko&s;&s;acks,</HI> the <HI>Yusbeks,</HI> and other <HI>Tartars</HI> were &s;u&s;pected to be forming again&s;t the Empire. Others from the Confines toward <HI>Turkie</HI> and <HI>India,</HI> who brought no le&s;s unplea&s;ing Tydings. However at Court they fear'd no War but only from tho&s;e two &s;ides, e&s;pecially the latter: for the Turks had their hands full at <HI>Candy.</HI></P>
<P>As for the <HI>Indian</HI> King, all concurring Probabilities made 'em conjecture that he would engage in a War again&s;t <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> For be&s;ides that he was naturally of a haughty and Ambitious Di&s;po|&s;ition; that he was quiet at home, and had nothing to fear from abroad, he had a fair pretence to revenge the Affronts which his Emba&s;&s;adour <HI>Terviet-Kaan</HI> had receiv'd in <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> For in the Life of <HI>Habas</HI> II. we &s;hall give a full account of that Emba&s;&s;adour, who came to <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> in the year 1664. according to our account, with a Train of eight thou&s;and men: as al&s;o of the Pre&s;ents which he brought, &s;o rich as is hardly to be be|liev'd, as well in re&s;pect of tho&s;e which the King accepted, as tho&s;e which he refus'd. We &s;hall al&s;o there declare the Occa|&s;ion of his Emba&s;&s;ie, and of his &s;tay in the Court of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> the publick Affronts which <HI>Habas</HI> put upon him, on purpo&s;e in his Own to affront the Per&s;on of his Ma&s;ter <HI>Aureng-Zeeb,</HI> and to revenge him&s;elf for his delay in not &s;ending his Em|ba&s;&s;adour before; and la&s;tly, we &s;hall de&s;cribe the Pre&s;ents which the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> gave the Emba&s;&s;adour to carry to his Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P><HI>Habas</HI> II. di'd about fifteen days before the <HI>Indian</HI> Emba&s;&s;a|dour arriv'd at his own Ma&s;ter's Court; who therefore not knowing as yet of his Death, and having had an account from his own Emba&s;&s;adour of the bad u&s;age he had receiv'd in the Court of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> te&s;tifi'd his re&s;entment with a more then ordinary fury. He pre&s;ently degraded <HI>Terviet-Kaan,</HI> upbraiding him for a Coward, and telling him he &s;hould rather have di'd then have &s;uffer'd &s;uch affronts. He caus'd all the goodly Hor&s;es which the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> had &s;ent him, to the number of Sixcore, to be brought out into the great <HI>Piazza</HI> of <HI>Dehly,</HI> his Royal Re|&s;idence, and there cut off their Legs. Afterwards, he caus'd all the co&s;tly Stuffs of Gold and Silk, the <HI>Turquoi&s;es,</HI> and all other Pre&s;ents &s;ent him by the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Monarch to be publickly burnt,
<PB N="103" REF="272">
and, as if he re&s;olv'd to declare open War, he forbad his Subjects all manner of Commerce with the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> either by Land or Sea, and &s;ent expre&s;s Orders to all the Ports of <HI>India</HI> that no <HI>Indian</HI> Ve&s;&s;els &s;hould &s;tir out of the Kingdom. The news of the&s;e proceedings coming to <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> made mo&s;t people believe that nothing but a War was intended, and every one prepar'd for it. But they that had a deeper reach, were not &s;o po&s;itive in their judgments, tho they dur&s;t not di&s;cover their thoughts. But he who mo&s;t upheld this news of an <HI>Indian</HI> War, and gave mo&s;t credit to it, was <HI>Gem&s;hid-Kaan-Koular, Agacie,</HI> General of the Slaves, a great Favourite at Court, and as a Friend e&s;teem'd by the General of the Army. This &s;ame <HI>Grandee,</HI> being one of the fal&s;e&s;t per&s;ons that ever were, during the fir&s;t nine Months of the New King's Reign, had contriv'd &s;o many dangerous de&s;igns, as well again&s;t the Meaner &s;ort as again&s;t the Grandees, that at length &s;ome of his practices being di&s;cover'd, he became odious to all, and had drawn upon him|&s;elf the Univer&s;al hatred of the Courtiers; &s;o that he was &s;ufficiently apprehen&s;ive that he could not re&s;i&s;t &s;o many Ene|mies. True it is, that he had the favour of the King and the General of the Army; yet was it not &s;o a&s;&s;ur'd that he could promi&s;e him&s;elf the continuance of it for any long time. Therefore he thought the &s;afe&s;t Cour&s;e he could take at &s;uch a tickli&s;h conjuncture was to retire as far from the Court as he could under a &s;pecious and very honourable pretence. And in regard the Government of <HI>Candabar</HI> pre&s;ented him an opportunity &s;o favourable to his de&s;ign he endeavour'd to have the Grant of it.</P>
<P>To that purpo&s;e he labour'd the confirmation of the fal&s;e reports that were &s;pread of the War which the King of the <HI>Indies</HI> threaten'd again&s;t <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> He gave his Maje&s;ty Intelli|gence, which he &s;aid was mo&s;t certain, that the <HI>Indian</HI> Prince was coming to be&s;iege <HI>Candabar</HI> with a mighty Army; that the better to accompli&s;h his de&s;igns, and draw the <HI>Yusbecs</HI> to his Party, he had &s;ent 'em fifty <HI>Lacres</HI> of <HI>Roupies,</HI> amounting to about &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, upon condition that they would declare open Ho&s;tilty again&s;t <HI>Per&s;ia:</HI> that <HI>Au|rengh Zeeb</HI> him&s;elf had already tak'n the Field. In a word, he knew &s;o well how to lay his Stories &s;o cunningly together, and to render the Terrors and Affrights which he forg'd &s;o probable, that all the bu&s;ine&s;s was now to apply remedies to tho&s;e Mi&s;|chiefs that were thought to be &s;o near approaching, and &s;o dan|gerous. Thereupon he counterfeits him&s;elf to be the mo&s;t
<PB N="104" REF="273">
faithful Subject, and mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate for his Countries welfare in the World. He vow'd that he him&s;elf &s;hould be the <HI>Korban,</HI> as they call it, or the Sacrifice that would be offer'd for the &s;afety of the People, and that he would go him&s;elf to <HI>Kandaar,</HI> and there expo&s;e his own Per&s;on to the fir&s;t A&s;&s;aults of his Enemies. He al&s;o engages the General of the Army in this Intrigue; who be&s;ides was willing enough of him&s;elf to re|turn him like for like, and to repay him for the kindne&s;s he had done him, as we have already related. The King therefore per|&s;uaded by the&s;e two Lords that were his Confidents, the one the General of his Armies, and the other General of his Slaves, granted to the latter what he contended for with &s;o much heat, and gave him a Commi&s;&s;ion to rai&s;e men for <HI>Kandaar,</HI> with hopes of the Government it &s;elf in a &s;hort time. Which was no &s;mall joy to this &s;ame contriver of Wiles and Intrigues, who thereby thought him&s;elf &s;afe &s;helter'd from all tho&s;e mi&s;chiefs which his turbulent &s;pirit had brought upon him.</P>
<P>We have already told ye that this Lord was always look'd upon as a notorious Cheat, and that in the Reign of <HI>Habas</HI> II. being &s;upported by the favour of his Prince he had put a hun|dred tricks upon the Court: that he took money at that time of all that offer'd it him: promi&s;ing to help 'em to the Offices and Employments for which they &s;u'd: but that when he had their money, he pre&s;ently forgot all his Promi&s;es: that it was his pa&s;time to &s;ow di&s;cord, and kindle the Coals of Di&s;&s;ention: that he forg'd dangerous Calumnies and Accu&s;ations again&s;t his Competitors, and with a brazen forehead utter'd 'em to the King for real Truths. As to other things he was a comely well proportion'd Per&s;on, a man of great Courage and Wit, dextrou&s;ly handl'd his Arms, and liberal to Magnificence: &s;o that he might have pa&s;s'd for one of the brave&s;t men in the World, had it not been for that &s;ame black Malignity that in|fected all the re&s;t of his Actions. In a word, there never was in one man a greater Medley of good and bad Qua|lities.</P>
<P>His good Qualities gain'd him the affection of his Ma&s;ters; his bad ones render'd him odious and formidable to his Equals: and having gain'd the Affection of his Young Sovereign, as he had won the favour of his Father, he practis'd the &s;ame fooleries under the new Prince as before.</P>
<P>One of the fir&s;t mi&s;chievous Pranks fell upon <HI>Mirza Ibrahim,</HI> or <HI>Abraham, Vazier,</HI> or <HI>Royal</HI> Farmer of <HI>Azour-beyan</HI> or <HI>Media;</HI> which is one of the riche&s;t in all <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> From this per&s;on
<PB N="105" REF="273">
he &s;queez'd four thou&s;and pounds, and withal brought him into &s;o much trouble that he caus'd him to lo&s;e the greate&s;t part of his E&s;tate, and to fall under that di&s;plea&s;ure of his Prince, that he could never &s;ince recover him&s;elf, nor is it thought he ever will. And thus it hapned: The General of the Slaves having a de&s;ign to get that Sum of four thou&s;and pounds, addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to the Nephew of that rich Farmer; for the Uncle was then at <HI>Tauris</HI> where his Employment lay. This was a young Gentleman, the Son of <HI>Mirza Sadek</HI> or <HI>ju&s;t Lord,</HI> Farmer al&s;o of the Province of <HI>Fars,</HI> not inferiour to the other for profit. And this Young Lord had al&s;o at Court the Employment of <HI>Erbaeb Tahuel,</HI> or Chief Surveyour of the Kings Buildings and Hou&s;es in <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI> To whom the General of the Slaves one day, taking him a&s;ide thus delivers him&s;elf. <HI>What makes thy Uncle</HI> Mirza-Ibrahim <HI>now at</HI> Tauris? <HI>Why does he not come to Court? Is there any more fit than he to &s;upply the place of Prime Mini&s;ter?</HI> Maho|met Mekdy <HI>who enjoys it at pre&s;ent is a Bufflehead, and a Changeling, unfit to manage publick bu&s;ine&s;s. I partly know the King intends to confer his Employment upon &s;ome body more worthy; Nor can I tell where there is a per&s;on more fit for &s;uch an important Tru&s;t then</HI> Mirza Ibrahim. <HI>And I believe I could with little trouble procure it for him by the help of &s;ome Pre&s;ents, which &s;hould not be very ex|pen&s;ive neither. If thou wilt give me a thou&s;and Tomans</HI> (or four thou&s;and pounds) <HI>I dare undertake, in&s;tead of a</HI> Vazier <HI>of a Pro|vince to make him Grand Vizier of all</HI> Per&s;ia.</P>
<P>To this the young Lord repli'd, that he would con&s;ider of it: and no &s;ooner had he left the General, but he di&s;patches in all ha&s;t a Courrier to his Uncle, to let him know what the General of the Slaves had propos'd to him. Upon which the <HI>Vazier</HI> by the &s;ame Courrier &s;ends an Order to his Nephew to pay the Money deman|ded; which was done accordingly. Soon after another Courrier arrives at <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> from <HI>Myrza Ibrahim.</HI> For he a&s;&s;ur'd him&s;elf of his advancement to the Chief Mini&s;try, and &s;o much the rather, becau&s;e he conceiv'd him&s;elf fit for &s;uch a Dignity, as indeed he was; and therefore to facilitate his Preferment, by the &s;ame Courrier he be&s;ought leave of his Maje&s;ty that he might come and ki&s;s his Feet; &s;ince it could be no prejudice to his Maje&s;ty, in regard his Son was able to &s;upply his Place. The other Mini&s;ters, who knew nothing of the Intrigue, never imagin'd that &s;uch a permi&s;&s;ion could be any way prejudicial to their In|tere&s;ts, or that it was only a pretence for the foundation of a more Important De&s;ign. So that his Reque&s;t was granted, and an Order &s;ign'd for him to come and ki&s;s the Kings Feet, leaving his Son to &s;upply his Place.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="274">
While the&s;e two Courriers were coming and going, a re|port, that was only whi&s;per'd about, came to the Ears of <HI>Mirza Ibrahams</HI> Nephew, that the General of the Slaves was ready to depart for <HI>Candaar.</HI> Thereupon he labours more ex|actly to inform him&s;elf, and under&s;tanding it was too true, he bethought him&s;elf of the Thou&s;and <HI>Tomans</HI> which he had paid him in his Uncles behalf, which were like to be lo&s;t if he did not &s;peedily look about him. Thereupon he went and gave the General of the Slaves a Vi&s;it, and civilly hinted to him to be mindful of the promi&s;e which he made to bring his Uncle into his Maje&s;ties favour, and of the Money which he had paid him upon that con&s;ideration: that he under&s;tood the General of the Slaves was going to leave the Court, to the ruine of his Uncle's Intere&s;t: or at lea&s;t if the bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould &s;ucceed it would not by his procurement; and therefore be&s;ought him to return the four thou&s;and pounds which he had paid him. At which reque&s;t the General of the Slaves did not &s;eem to be in the lea&s;t offended; but made an&s;wer, that 'twas all the rea&s;on in the world, and &s;o appointed a certain time to repay the Sum. Which time being come, he &s;ent him away again with the &s;ame an&s;wer from one day to another. Still <HI>Mirza Ibra|him</HI>'s Nephew follow'd him clo&s;e without letting any opportu|nity &s;lip: but &s;till the young Lord was as careful to &s;peak &s;oftly, or when he was alone, for fear of divulging a &s;ecret that would have been the ruine of his own and his Uncle's Family. At length the General of the Slaves, a&s;ham'd of having put off the young Lord &s;o many times, and now being run to the end of his Rope, as one that had no more Excu&s;es to make, he re&s;olv'd to break off at once with the <HI>Vazier,</HI> that he might deliver him&s;elf from his importunate Sollicitor. To this purpo&s;e, one Evening, at the time that he was ready to go to his Prayers, and from thence to Court (for 'tis the Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> to &s;ay their Prayers in Publick) perceiving the young Lord at a di&s;tance advancing toward him, he took that opportunity when there was a great number of People and &s;e|veral per&s;ons of Quality to hear him; at what time, as &s;oon as the young Lord came near him, fetching a deep &s;igh, and lifting up his Eyes and Arms to Heaven, <HI>Good God,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>what &s;hall I do with this man, he pur&s;ues me every where like a Criminal, he will not give me time to &s;ay my Prayers; he haunts me, going into my Haram among my Women; I find him at my heels whereever I go; prithee Friend what would&s;t have me do to &s;atisfie thee? Am I King of</HI> Per&s;ia, <HI>to create thy Uncle Prime Mini&s;ter of State?</HI>
<PB N="107" REF="274">
<HI>Prethee go to his Maje&s;ty; the bu&s;ine&s;s does not lie in my Power.</HI></P>
<P>You may ea&s;ily judge what a Thunder Clap this was to the young Lord: he would not for ten times the Sum that he had provok'd tho&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions from a man &s;o ill principl'd; he repented with all his heart that he had pre&s;s'd him &s;o clo&s;e, but 'twas too late: for <HI>Mirza Ibrahim</HI>'s Plot was thereby di&s;cover'd; and all the Court that knew him rightly, believ'd 'twould co&s;t his Ambition &s;auce; as indeed it fell out.</P>
<P>By a Quirk of the &s;ame nature, the General of the Slaves had already formerly hook'd out of the <HI>Nazir</HI> or Lord Trea|&s;urer's Pocket three hundred <HI>Tomans,</HI> which make a thou&s;and pound, at the time that the Court return'd to <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI> To which purpo&s;e the cunning Fox went to him at his hou&s;e, all in a heat, and after he had drawn him a&s;ide, <HI>Sir,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>I come to a&s;&s;ure you, that your Head, which the practice of your Enemies had endanger'd, is now &s;ecure. The King at fir&s;t began to li&s;ten to their Calumnies, &s;o that had not I interpos'd for your &s;afety, the King was re&s;olv'd neither to have &s;ent you the Habit, nor the Pa|tent Royal. The General of the Mu&s;quetteers was he that did you the mo&s;t prejudice, which caus'd a Quarrel between us; I &s;uppo&s;e you will acknowledge the kindne&s;s we have done you.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ame Prank he plaid <HI>Mirza Moumen,</HI> that is, <HI>Lord without Blot,</HI> the <HI>Nazir,</HI> or Superintendant of the Stables, who was drawn in by him for about nine thou&s;and pounds by making him believe that he had protected him again&s;t Potent Accu&s;ers, who &s;ought to bring him under his Maje&s;ties di&s;plea|&s;ure. But that was not all, for that he was re&s;olv'd to imploy his Credit with his Ma&s;ter, as to rai&s;e him from being Trea|&s;urer of the <HI>Stables</HI> to be Trea&s;urer of the Kings Demeans, in the room of <HI>Mac-Soud-Bec,</HI> who unde&s;ervedly enjoy'd the Em|ployment, and who&s;e head already totter'd upon his &s;houlders; for that the King was re&s;olv'd that none of tho&s;e &s;hould live who had oppos'd his Advancement to the Throne.</P>
<P>Upon his Departure al&s;o, that he might leave &s;ome marks behind him of his malicious Cunning, he re&s;olv'd to &s;et the King's two Chief Eunuchs (who are petty Kings in the Palace) together by the ears to the mutual perdition of each other; that is the <HI>Mehther</HI> or Lord <HI>Chamberlain;</HI> and the <HI>Aga Moubarek,</HI> or Over|&s;eer of the Queen Mothers Hou&s;hold.</P>
<P>To that purpo&s;e he went to the High Chamberlain, to tell him as a &s;ecret of great Importance, and which the Friend&s;hip
<PB N="108" REF="275">
he had for him, oblig'd him to reveal, that <HI>Aga Moubarek</HI> took all opportunities to &s;lander and accu&s;e him to the King, but that his wickedne&s;s fell upon his own head: for that he had often heard his Maje&s;ty &s;ay, that he could no longer endure the Back|biting Tongue and Malignity of that per&s;on; that he was re|&s;olv'd to have put him to death, and had done it already, had it not been for &s;ome remainder of kindne&s;s he has for him; for the &s;ervice he did him at his Fathers death &s;topt his di&s;plea&s;ure. At the &s;ame time he went to <HI>Aga Moubarek,</HI> and told him al&s;o the very &s;ame Story of the Chamberlains Inveteracy again&s;t him. So that the two Eunuchs fo&s;ter'd for &s;ome time a &s;ecret and implacable hatred one again&s;t the other: both expecting when the effects of the Princes Anger would break out to the ruine of his Enemy, according as the General of the Slaves had fed their hopes. But the time being elaps'd, and nothing hapning of what they were made believe; they began to doubt the truth of what he had inform'd 'em. And therefore know|ing the Author of the Story to be a great forger of Lies, they re&s;olv'd to find out the truth.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mehther</HI> or High Chamberlain was the fir&s;t that di&s;co|ver'd it. For being &s;aluted one day with the u&s;ual Comple|ments, the Great Chamberlain coldly repli'd, <HI>There's a Tongue that coldly &s;alutes my Ears, but &s;tabs me to the heart,</HI> and then drawing him a&s;ide, <HI>What unkindne&s;s,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>have I done you, that you &s;hould go about to procure my death, by rendring me odious to the Prince as you do every day: all my comfort is, you will not be &s;o &s;uc|ce&s;sful in your enterprize as you think for.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Aga Moubarek</HI> finding thereby a Gate opened for di&s;covery, <HI>'Tis not for you,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>but for me to complain. For is it not you that have been continually pealing in the Kings Ears &s;uch and &s;uch &s;tories concerning me; which had been enough to have taken away my life, had his Maje&s;ty given credit to your Tales, but thanks be to God they were not believ'd.</HI></P>
<P>The two Eunuchs were &s;o &s;trangely &s;urpriz'd to find them|&s;elves upbraided with the &s;ame unkindne&s;&s;es, that they began to compare their accu&s;ations of each other, with which they were charg'd, and that Examination at la&s;t di&s;cover'd that it was but a <HI>Romance,</HI> tho a pernicious Romance, which the General of the Slaves had compos'd to &s;et tho&s;e two Lords together by the Ears, and to make his advantage of their quarrelling. Never|thele&s;s &s;eeing the dark contrivance had not &s;ucceeded altoge|ther, they di&s;&s;embl'd their re&s;entment at pre&s;ent, and &s;aid nothing: re&s;olving to wait for an opportunity of Revenge,
<PB N="109" REF="275">
which they vow'd &s;hould never e&s;cape 'em, whenever it offer'd it &s;elf.</P>
<P>The&s;e Eunuchs are very ready at the&s;e kind of dark Contri|vances: there being no people in the World that know how to carry on a private Revenge by clo&s;e and covert means, and then give fire to the Mine of a &s;udden, &s;o well as they do: nor did they fail to pay this crafty Deceiver in his own Coin; For it is thought that they were the per&s;ons who mainly contributed to his di&s;grace and death.</P>
<P>But now &s;o &s;oon as the General of the Slaves had receiv'd his Commi&s;&s;ion for the Government of <HI>Cand-daar,</HI> and to with&s;tand the Inva&s;ion of the <HI>Indians,</HI> he began to rai&s;e Sol|diers at <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> which he caus'd to be exercis'd every day, with &s;o much exactne&s;s, as if the Enemy had been at the Gates: and after he had mu&s;ter'd together four thou&s;and, all &s;tout proper fellows, he declar'd he would rai&s;e no more, that Recruit be|ing &s;ufficient: and he order'd his bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o well by the a&s;&s;i|&s;tance of the General of the Army, that the King, whom they a&s;&s;ur'd that the Enemy was at hand, caus'd his di&s;patches to be made for <HI>Serdaar</HI> or Chief General of <HI>Kandar,</HI> and the Ter|ritories belonging to it, and made him Governour of the Pro|vince and City it &s;elf, being a famous Garri&s;on, and the Key of the Kingdom toward <HI>India.</HI> It is &s;eated upon three ri&s;ing Grounds, which defend each other; the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> e&s;teeming it im|pregnable, and it is a Proverb among&s;t 'em, <HI>Who &s;hall take the Habitation of &s;ecurity?</HI> Alluding to the word <HI>Candaar,</HI> which &s;ig|nifies the &s;ame thing.</P>
<P>Before this Lord departed he obtain'd of the King, that his Brother <HI>Phereidon-Bek,</HI> &s;hould &s;upply his Place of General of the Slaves, as his Lieutenant, till his Son, to whom the Prince had granted the Rever&s;ion, &s;hould be of years to manage it him&s;elf: and not content with that, he al&s;o procur'd an Order from the King, by which his Maje&s;ty gave him leave to come to Court when he pleas'd, without asking leave. And thus <HI>Gem&s;hid-Kaan</HI> departed well &s;atisfi'd, conceiving with him&s;elf, that he had craftily di&s;intangl'd him&s;elf from all tho&s;e troubles which his ill management had brought upon him at Court.</P>
<P>Some few days after this Lord was thus departed there was no more talk of the War; on the other &s;ide it was evident there would be none. For the report ran about, that <HI>Aureng-Zeeb</HI> under&s;tanding that <HI>Habas</HI> II. was dead, and that his Succe&s;&s;or was but young and unexperienc'd, &s;corn'd the En|counter of &s;o trivial an Enemy. Which <HI>Rodomontado</HI> of the
<PB N="110" REF="276">
<HI>Indian</HI> Prince to &s;ave his Honour might have held good in the time of the <HI>Ru&s;tans,</HI> who were the <HI>Amadi&s;'s</HI> of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> at what time they never enter'd into Combat but for Honour. But now Monarchs never fight hand to hand, nor in &s;ingle Duels to try each others &s;trength. But they fight Army again&s;t Army, and their only aim is the Conque&s;t of Cities and Provinces, a&s;&s;ailing whatever they think they can ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>All the World knew that for three months after the death of <HI>Habas</HI> II. was known in the <HI>Indies,</HI> the Prince of that Coun|try &s;till continu'd his preparations of War, in order to the be&s;ieging of <HI>Candaar;</HI> of which this was an evident proof, for that all that while, all Commerce was forbidden with <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> as before. Which would not have been, had the <HI>Indian</HI> Prince abandon'd his de&s;igns of the War, in deri&s;ion of his feeble Enemy, whom he thought too young to be the &s;ubject of his Triumphs.</P>
<P>The truth was, as I have heard from very Intelligent per|&s;ons. that <HI>Aureng-Zeeb</HI> was diverted from his Enterprize by the Prince&s;s his Si&s;ter, who us'd the&s;e Arguments to him, That it was not proper for him to hazard the Honour he had won; that till that time he had Reign'd in high Reputation, which he could never lo&s;e &s;o long as he kept him&s;elf quiet. That For|tune could not make him greater then he was, but that &s;he might prove froward to his prejudice. That the taking of <HI>Can|daar</HI> was no &s;uch ea&s;ie thing, which his Father had twice with two potent Armies attempted in vain. That the chiefe&s;t part of his Courtiers being <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> they would &s;erve him very unwillingly, and a&s;&s;i&s;t him but coldly; and in a word; That if he did not &s;ucceed in the War, it would be a &s;tain to his Re|putation, which he would never be able to wipe out. E&s;pe|cially &s;ince his Reputation had no need of this Conque&s;t to aggrandize it &s;elf, as being &s;ufficient to &s;upport it &s;elf without it. To which rea&s;ons of his Si&s;ter the Prince &s;ubmitted: and without doubt he did wi&s;ely: there being nothing &s;o true as what the Prince&s;s told him, that there was little to be got by the Enterprize, but much to be lo&s;t.</P>
<P>The General of the Slaves before, now General of the Armies, had not been gone above a Month from Court, when <HI>Mirza-Ibrahim</HI> arriv'd at <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> in a trembling and quivering condi|tion, after he had been put in &s;uch great hopes. For he had been inform'd at <HI>Tauris,</HI> what a Trick the General of the Slaves had put upon him, and how he had di&s;cover'd the whole &s;ecret of his Project. However having receiv'd a permi&s;&s;ion to come
<PB N="111" REF="276">
to Court, there was a nece&s;&s;ity for him to go: &s;o that being re|duc'd to this extremity he was not &s;o eager upon his journey: he made but &s;low preparations, and delay'd his departure as long as po&s;&s;ibly he could: excu&s;ing him&s;elf &s;ometimes by rea&s;on of the bad weather, the bad <HI>Po&s;ition</HI> of the Planets, or his own Indi&s;po&s;ition of body. But at length go he mu&s;t, but he travell'd &s;uch ea&s;ie days journeys, that he &s;pent double the time that he needed to have done; and perhaps he did it to &s;hun his meeting with the General of the Slaves upon the Road, being upon his march to his New Government.</P>
<P>How he was receiv'd at Court you may ea&s;ily judge: for there was not one living &s;oul that vouch&s;af'd him a kind look. So that to mollifie the hearts of the Grand Mini&s;ters and Potent Lords, he was forc'd to expend a good part of the Trea&s;ure that he had hoarded up, and to &s;uffer him&s;elf to be de&s;poyl'd of that which he had pillag'd from the People.</P>
<P>And as for the Grand Mini&s;ters the better to accompli&s;h their de&s;ign of &s;queezing Rich Pre&s;ents out of his Coffers, they back'd all Complaints that were made again&s;t him at Court. For you mu&s;t under&s;tand that in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> every private Per&s;on, let his Condition be never &s;o mean, is allow'd to bring his Complaints again&s;t the Governours, Royal Farmers, and other Per&s;ons, who have any Authority over 'em. So that when the Grandees at Court have a mind to ruine any great Per&s;onage in the Pro|vinces abroad, there u&s;ual Policy is to &s;upport the Complaints of the Oppre&s;s'd; and to make 'em the more Ponderous, they invite all that will come, and then cau&s;e 'em to appear at the Palace in &s;hoals to demand Ju&s;tice. Which cour&s;e was taken with this &s;ame Lord. But in regard the Principal Courtiers had no mind utterly to ruine him, which had been only a particular benefit to the King; but rather to &s;hew him, that it lay in their power, to the end they might make their be&s;t advantage of him them&s;elves, they would not &s;uf|fer the Clamours of his Impeachers to run too high; but &s;atisfi'd the greate&s;t part, by cau&s;ing him to re&s;tore to his mo&s;t dangerous Accu&s;ers a part of what he had extorted from them.</P>
<P>But among all the re&s;t his greate&s;t Enemy at Court was that Bruti&s;h Old Signior, the <HI>Generali&s;&s;imo, Hali-Kouli-Kaan,</HI> who mortally and &s;o openly hated him, that he would neither ac|cept of his Vi&s;its, nor his Pre&s;ents. The rea&s;on of which ani|mo&s;ity was, becau&s;e that in the Reign of <HI>Habas</HI> II. about twelve years before his death, when the General of the Army, being
<PB N="112" REF="277">
then in his Government of <HI>Tauris,</HI> fell a &s;econd time under the di&s;plea&s;ure of his Prince, for the rea&s;ons already related, and after a Confi&s;cation of all his Goods, was &s;ent a Pri&s;oner to <HI>Casbin, Mirza-Sadek,</HI> Brother of this <HI>Mirza-Ibrahim,</HI> being at that time <HI>Farmer Royal</HI> of the &s;ame City and Province, was ap|pointed Commi&s;&s;ioner by his Maje&s;ty for the &s;ale of tho&s;e Confi&s;cated Goods: At what time he carri'd him&s;elf &s;o rigo|rou&s;ly that he took away the very <HI>Tombans</HI> or Linnen Drawers belonging to his Wives, and &s;old 'em in open Market: for in regard the di&s;grac'd Lord had &s;everal Wives, and for that the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Ladies are all &s;umptuou&s;ly habited; there are &s;ome of the&s;e under-Drawers that are worth thirty or forty Crowns; &s;o that a good number might come to a great deal of Money.</P>
<P>This Affront touch'd the General to the Quick, and enrag'd him to that exce&s;s again&s;t the whole Family, that he gave it its full &s;winge, fir&s;t again&s;t the <HI>Vazier</HI> him&s;elf, who had given him the Affront. For after he was re&s;tor'd, and found he had power to do what he pleas'd, he &s;ent for him, and not &s;o much as vouch&s;afing to &s;ee him when he arrived, he caus'd him to be &s;hut up in his Stables; where to do him the greate&s;t Injury that could be done him in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> he expos'd him to the bea&s;tly Pa&s;&s;i|on of &s;ix lu&s;ty Grooms.</P>
<P><HI>Mirza Ibrahim</HI> was not ignorant of all this, and knew how far the Tran&s;ports of his Pride and Cruelty was able to carry him: he &s;aw him newly re&s;tor'd, and advanc'd to the third dignity in the Kingdom; and that which was of more im|portance, that he was the Chief in favour, and that the King li&s;ten'd to him as his Governour. For tho&s;e rea&s;ons he conje|ctur'd rightly that among tho&s;e that &s;ought his ruine, there was not any one who had more Power, or a greater good Will. Therefore he re&s;olv'd to purcha&s;e his favour, whatever it co&s;t him; or if he could not oblige him to do him a kindne&s;s, at lea&s;t that he would be pleas'd to hold his tongue. To which purpo&s;e he went to give him a Vi&s;it, de&s;iring he might be ad|mitted to pay him Reverence. At fir&s;t when the <HI>Vazier</HI> enter'd the General of the Army pretended not to &s;ee him, but feign|ing as if his head ak'd, call'd for a Couch to lie down, where after he had lain about two hours, he retir'd into his Palace, leaving a great throng of People that waited without to come another time, and among the re&s;t <HI>Mirza Ibrahim.</HI></P>
<P>However <HI>Mirza Ibrahim</HI> would not take this for a denial, but return'd the next day; To whom the General, taking no
<PB N="113" REF="277">
notice that he had demanded leave to be admitted to make his &s;alutation in the great Hall where he di&s;patch'd all Comers and Goers, gave him no An&s;wer, &s;o that the poor Lord was forc'd to &s;tand three hours together among the Officers and Common Per&s;ons; and after that he pa&s;s'd by him without &s;o much as looking upon him, and &s;o took hor&s;e before his Palace Gate. <HI>Mirza Ibrahim</HI> follow'd him; and keeping clo&s;e to him, ever now and then gave him the u&s;ual Salute of <HI>My Lord, peace be with yee,</HI> and that &s;o loud that he might ea&s;ily be heard. At fir&s;t the General of the Army &s;aid nothing to him; but finding the other &s;till pur&s;ue him, tir'd with his importunate Complements, turning about, <HI>Gidi &s;egh, Cur&s;ed Dog,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>what have I to do with thee, or thou with me? Go to the Devil, and let me never &s;ee thee more.</HI> And having &s;o &s;aid, he caus'd his Servants to thru&s;t him away.</P>
<P>Poor <HI>Mirza Ibrahim</HI> &s;eeing him&s;elf &s;o cour&s;ely us'd, made trial of Pre&s;ents, the great Spring that moves the whole Court of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> To that purpo&s;e he &s;ent the General two thou&s;and <HI>Tomans,</HI> which the General refus'd: the other believing 'twas too little &s;ent again two thou&s;and five hundred; which were &s;ent back as before; then he &s;ent three thou&s;and, which had no better acceptance; after that four thou&s;and, which &s;till could make no impre&s;&s;ion in the haughty Spirit of the Exa&s;pera|ted Lord: So that at length he &s;ent five thou&s;and <HI>Tomans,</HI> which comes to twenty thou&s;and pounds. And then, &s;omewhat &s;uppl'd, he invited <HI>Mirza Ibrahim</HI> two days after to his <HI>Megeles,</HI> or Publick Fea&s;t: neverthele&s;s he &s;hew'd him no particular Ci|vility, nor &s;aid any thing to him, more then what is u&s;ually &s;poken to all the Gue&s;ts, <HI>Kochs-Geldi, Y'are welcome.</HI> I que&s;tion'd the truth of this Pre&s;ent of twenty thou&s;and pounds when I heard it related the fir&s;t time, not believing that any per&s;on would purcha&s;e any mans favour at &s;o dear a Rate, but afterwards up|on farther examination I found it to be really true. And I the rather give this Adverti&s;ement to the Reader, that he may not mi&s;tru&s;t the fidelity of my Relations, or think that I &s;peak by <HI>Hear&s;ay,</HI> and not upon any exact information.</P>
<P>All this while the Kings di&s;temper increas'd upon him, that he could ride no longer, &s;o that he never went abroad with his Wives but in a <HI>Kagia veh,</HI> which are little wooden &s;heds carri'd by gread Camels, wherein they u&s;ually put their Women, when they go to take the Air.</P>
<P>In this Condition he continued a month: tho all the while he would not forbear his u&s;ual recreations with his Wives. The
<PB N="114" REF="278">
<HI>Kourrourks</HI> continu'd in all the parts round about <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> where the Prince caus'd all the hand&s;om women to be taken up, and brought to his <HI>Haram.</HI></P>
<P>One day the Queen Mother had a de&s;ire to &s;ee the Fortre&s;s of the City, where are kept all the Curio&s;ities and rarities belong|ing to the pre&s;ent Monarch, and his Ance&s;tors, whether Pre|&s;ents, or Purchas'd, or Trophies of their Conque&s;ts. To which purpo&s;e &s;he per&s;uaded her Son to carry her thither; &s;o that there was a <HI>Kourrouk</HI> proclaim'd all over one part of the City, which was never known, or at lea&s;t never remembred by any body then alive.</P>
<P>Now it haepn'd that one time, as the King was thus &s;porting him&s;elf abroad with his Wives, an Accident fell out, that ren|der'd 'em &s;till more un&s;upportable to the People. His Maje&s;ty at that time lay in the Fields without <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> under Tents, in Harve&s;t time, when the &s;heaves lay heap'd up one upon another in the Grounds, and as he was one that greatly delighted in Fireworks, &s;ome flying Rockets were pre&s;ented him one Evening of an extraordinary weight (for there are &s;ome that weigh forty pounds) of which he order'd a trial to be made. But their extraordinary weight hindering the Ma&s;&s;ie Squib from mount|ing directly upwards, as it &s;hould have done, and &s;o not flying very high, they made a kind of a Semicircle at a di&s;tance, which carri'd 'em a great way into the Fields, where they &s;et the Sheaves on fire, and burnt the Corn together with &s;ome hou&s;es that &s;tood not far off. So that the lo&s;s was valu'd at &s;ixteen thou&s;and pounds; and the mi&s;ery was, that this accident happen'd when there was great &s;carcity of Corn.</P>
<P>Here I cannot omit a &s;mall Circum&s;tance, which has &s;ome affinity with what I have already &s;poken concerning that &s;pacious place full of Trees, and Alleys that compo&s;e the Avenues to the Palace; through one of which, call'd the Royal Alley, the King and his Train went always in and out, to avoid pa&s;&s;ing through the City. The other great Alleys were adorn'd with Beds and Borders planted with Flowers and &s;weet &s;melling herbs, which together with the Fountains and Rows of Trees caus'd a very plea&s;ant pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>In the mean time came certain intelligence that the <HI>Yusbecks</HI> were enter'd into the Province of <HI>Cora&s;on,</HI> or <HI>Bactriana.</HI> The Governour of the Province &s;ent Courrier after Courrier to the King for Orders; for that the Enemy was already enter'd the Kingdom, burning and &s;poiling all before 'em; and that unle&s;s &s;peedily oppos'd, the Province would be in danger to be lo&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="278">
The <HI>Yusbecks</HI> are a People that inhabit to the North of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing all that Country between the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea and the <HI>Indies;</HI> under &s;everal petty Sultans or Princes, ab&s;olute within them|&s;elves. They are called <HI>Yusbecks,</HI> at lea&s;t if the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Etymo|logy be true, by rea&s;on of the great number of Sovereign Prin|ces by which the Tartars are Govern'd; for <HI>Yus,</HI> as well in the Language of the Tartars as Turks, which is but a Dialect of it, &s;ignifies a <HI>hundred,</HI> and <HI>Bek,</HI> Lords; to &s;hew the great number of Ma&s;ters by which they are Rul'd. But tho&s;e People reject that Etymology, which they &s;ay is both fal&s;e and injurious to 'em; That the true Etymolgy is <HI>Yu&s;i,</HI> which &s;ignifies <HI>He</HI> in both Languages (tho pronounc'd <HI>Yus</HI> by cutting off the la&s;t Vowel) and <HI>Bek,</HI> Lord. So that when they &s;ay <HI>Yusbek,</HI> 'tis as much as to &s;ay, <HI>He the Lord,</HI> or <HI>He is the Lord;</HI> as if the&s;e People were the only People upon the Earth that are truly Lords. Such is the pride of this Nation, and the high conceit they have of their own merits. One of the principal Lords of the Per&s;ian Court, when he told me this he gave me an account of a certain petty King that Reign'd in the <HI>Molucca</HI>'s in the time of <HI>Habas</HI> the Great, who neverthele&s;s a&s;&s;um'd to him&s;elf a Grandeur almo&s;t equal to his: For he look'd upon him&s;elf to be the only lawful Lord of the Ea&s;t, and a&s;&s;um'd to him&s;elf the Title of &s;ole Monarch of it: Saying withal, that he knew not whether there were any other in the We&s;t; but that he was well a&s;&s;ur'd, that He him&s;elf was Ma&s;ter of that part of the World where he inhabited. For which rea&s;on he caus'd his Dominions to be call'd by way of Excel|lency <HI>Moulouk;</HI> that is to &s;ay, the true Kingdoms; for tho we pronounce the word <HI>Molucca's</HI> after our Manner, over all <HI>A&s;ia</HI> they write and pronounce it <HI>Moulouk.</HI></P>
<P>But among all tho&s;e petty Princes that Govern <HI>Tartary</HI> the le&s;s, there are three who are accounted the Principal. That is to &s;ay, the Prince of <HI>Bokora,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Balke,</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Carechme,</HI> or <HI>Orquenge,</HI> upon which the re&s;t in &s;ome manner or other have have their dependence. In the Reign of <HI>Sephi</HI> the Second, which the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> for di&s;tinction &s;ake call <HI>Mazi,</HI> the <HI>pa&s;s'd Reign,</HI> he being Grandfather to the pre&s;ent King; the&s;e <HI>Yuzbecks</HI> overrunning the Territories of <HI>Cora&s;&s;on,</HI> or <HI>Bactriana</HI> and <HI>Margiana,</HI> were pur&s;u'd by the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> who made a di&s;mal &s;laughter among 'em; after they had gain'd a mo&s;t &s;ignal Vi|ctory over the Enemy, killing twelve of eighteen Thou&s;and, of which their Body con&s;i&s;ted, and taking the re&s;t Pri&s;oners. Among the&s;e Captives there was a young Prince, one of the Cheiftaines of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> de&s;cended from the Royal Line of
<PB N="116" REF="279">
<HI>Karechme</HI> or <HI>Orquenge,</HI> who was call'd <HI>Abouel-Kazi,</HI> or the <HI>Fa|ther-Arbiter.</HI> This Pri&s;oner, being known to be what he was, among the re&s;t of the Pri&s;oners was carry'd to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> but his u&s;age was quite different. For <HI>Sephi</HI> did not look upon him as a Robber, but as a Prince who was only a Pri&s;oner of War, and paid him all tho&s;e Honours and Civilities due to a Per&s;onage of Royal Birth; a&s;&s;ign'd him a Revenue of fifteen hundred To|mans, which amounts to &s;ix thou&s;and pounds; gave him a &s;tate|ly Palace furni&s;h'd accordingly, a number of Officers, and a &s;uitable Train to attend him. And it was his Plea&s;ure, that the Vazier, or Trea&s;urer to the Governor of <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> &s;hould take care of his Per&s;on, and perform the Office of a <HI>Mehmandaar,</HI> who is the Per&s;on, as we may &s;ay, that takes care of the Gue&s;ts, and is the Ma&s;ter of the Entertainment. This <HI>Mehmandaar,</HI> for ten years together paid this <HI>Tartar-Prince</HI> by his Maje&s;ties Order all the Re&s;pect and Service which the rights of a mo&s;t tender Ho&s;pi|tality could rea&s;onably claim; and &s;uch as there could not be any thing &s;hew'd him more obliging in our be&s;t civiliz'd Provinces. On the other &s;ide, the Prince under&s;tood &s;o well how to di&s;gui&s;e the natural Savagene&s;s and Barbarity of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> that you would have taken him for a <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> he behav'd him&s;elf with &s;uch a Grace, and &s;o much affability in all things: So that his Maje&s;ty ob&s;erving him endow'd with &s;o many rare Qualities, &s;train'd his affection for him &s;o high, that he admitted him into his <HI>Megeles</HI> or Royal A&s;&s;emblies, where he rank'd him equal with the Gran|dees of his Kingdom, and for his maintainance a&s;&s;ign'd him Pen|&s;ions that were no way incon&s;iderable.</P>
<P>During his abode at <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> where he had liberty to go and come as he pleas'd, only attended by his <HI>Mehmendaar</HI> and the Guards that were a&s;&s;ign'd him, more in honour to his Per&s;on, then for a Watch on his Freedom; he had &s;till in his mind a natural hankering after his own Country, his Kindred, and that Sove|reignty to which he was lawful Heir. The Magnificence, the Mildne&s;s, the Beauty and delights of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> could not eradicate out of his Brea&s;t this violent affection for the place of his Nati|vity. For tho it were true, that nothing but Barrenne&s;s and a hideous pro&s;pect over&s;pread the Country for which he had &s;uch a lingring de&s;ire, however, it was the place where he was born, and where he was to change the condition of a Slave for that of a Ma&s;ter. Importun'd therefore by his own ardent de&s;ires he wrote privately to the King of <HI>Orquenge</HI> his Father, and be&s;ought him to endeavour his Liberty. Who having con&s;ulted what cour&s;e to take, pretends an occa&s;ion to &s;end an Emba&s;&s;ador into <HI>Per|&s;ia,</HI>
<PB N="117" REF="279">
who brought to the Prince the King his Fathers an&s;wer. And at length the Prince and the Emba&s;&s;ador agreed upon the man|ner of his e&s;cape; And then the Emba&s;&s;ador after a &s;tay of &s;ix Months took his leave of the Court. But then it was that the Prince, when he thought the Emba&s;&s;ador was got beyond the Bounds of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and that it was &s;ea&s;onable for him to make his e&s;cape, laid his Plot in this manner.</P>
<P>He feign'd him&s;elf one day to be very ill, and gave notice of his Indi&s;po&s;ition to the King: He added, that he had try'd &s;e|veral medicines to no purpo&s;e, and therefore by the advice of his Phy&s;icians, he believ'd there was no other cure for him but by the hot Baths about a days journey from <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> whither he ea&s;ily obtain'd leave to retire: at what time the Trea&s;urer to the Governor of <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> who&s;e Employment would not permit him to &s;tir out of the City, gave him for an attendant in his Room one of his Ma&s;ters Dome&s;tick Servants, with a Convoy of fifteen or &s;ixteen Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>At the time prefix'd there appear'd under the Trees without the Village, near the Baths, whither the Prince pretended to go for his Health, about twenty <HI>Yuzbecs</HI> all young cho&s;en fellows, nimble, well Mounted, and well Arm'd with certain Led-Hor&s;es. Pre&s;ently the Prince knew 'em, and without any further Con&s;ul|tation, leaving the &s;mall number of <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> which were then with him, up he gets a Hor&s;eback and putting Spurs to his Hor&s;e, away he gallops directly forward before his own Troop. There was not any one unle&s;s his Per&s;ian Guide that follow'd him, as dreaming of nothing le&s;s then the accident that had fallen out, neither had they men enough, nor time to call for more aid. And therefore the Deputy <HI>Mehmandaar,</HI> &s;eeing he had lo&s;t the great Tru&s;t that was committed to his charge, all that he could do, in &s;uch a &s;urprize, was &s;till to follow him, and try if his prayers and intreaties could move him to return. <HI>Sir,</HI> &s;aid He, <HI>what is my Crime, what is my Ill-fortune, or what Offence have I committed again&s;t you, that you thus go about to endanger my Head if I return to</HI> I&s;pahan <HI>without your Per&s;on? What can I expect le&s;s then to loo&s;e my Head? Nay, I fear the King will not be &s;atisfied with that &s;light pu|ni&s;hment, but without doubt in the exce&s;s of his Anger, will order my Bowels to be ripp'd out of my Belly.</HI> To whom the <HI>Yusbeck</HI> Prince thus briskly an&s;wer'd; <HI>I am highly oblig'd to the King of</HI> Per&s;ia, <HI>but I owe more my own Country and Relations that call me back. 'Tis my Father that &s;ends me the&s;e Men, to facilitate my return to my Native &s;oil, in expectation of that Crown which he de&s;igns me after his death: if thou wilt go along with me, I will repay thee for all tho&s;e kindne&s;&s;es I</HI>
<PB N="118" REF="280">
<HI>have received in</HI> Per&s;ia, <HI>and I will make thee one of the Lords of my Kingdom; If not, return in time, and tell thy King that I return him thanks for all his Favours, and that I &s;hall always be his Goulom</HI> or Slave, <HI>and &s;hall believe my &s;elf oblig'd to him as long as I live: and that in time I will make him &s;en&s;ible of the truth of my Promi&s;es.</HI> Having &s;o &s;aid, he put &s;purs to his Hor&s;e, and flew away with that &s;wift|ne&s;s, that the Per&s;ian <HI>Mehmandaar</HI> &s;oon lo&s;t &s;ight of him. For there is not any Nation under Heaven that ride more &s;wiftly then the&s;e <HI>Yusbecks.</HI></P>
<P>When this e&s;cape was known at <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> a great number of Hor&s;e-men were &s;ent after the Prince, but all to no purpo&s;e, he having got the &s;tart &s;o far before 'em: the Court was in an amaze, e&s;pecially the King, who never dreamt that <HI>Abouel-Kazi</HI> ever dream'd of <HI>Tartary;</HI> being verily per&s;waded that after ten years, that he had liv'd in his Court, he could never have any more remembrance of his own Country.</P>
<P>But as the Tartar Prince could not forget his own Country, &s;o neither did he forget his obligations to Per&s;ia and the Per&s;ian Monarch. For all his life-time he had a particular affection for that Kingdom, more e&s;pecially when he came to &s;ucceed his Father; which was pre&s;ently after his Return. And &s;o long as he Reign'd, he was not only careful to keep a good corre&s;pon|dence with <HI>Sephi</HI> the fir&s;t, and <HI>Habas</HI> the &s;econd, but he al&s;o kept in &s;uch awe <HI>Sub-haan-Kooli-Kaan, The Prince, the Slave of the Prai&s;e|worthy,</HI> by which they mean <HI>God;</HI> and <HI>Abdul-hazize-Kaan</HI> or <HI>the Servant of the Maje&s;ty,</HI> under&s;tood <HI>Divine,</HI> King of <HI>Bokora;</HI> the only two Princes which &s;ometimes infe&s;ted the Confines of Per|&s;ia, that they were not able to undertake any con&s;iderable Enter|pri&s;e. For when either the one or the other enter'd Per&s;ia, pre|&s;ently he was in the Bowels of their Territories, thereby con&s;train|ing 'em to return with more ha&s;t then they went. And thus all the Frontier Provinces, as <HI>Bactriana, Margiana, Drangiana,</HI> and the Ca&s;pian Coa&s;ts enjoy'd a profound Peace. So that <HI>Habas</HI> won by his grateful and con&s;tant affection, with the &s;ame grati|tude repaid the Prince's per&s;everance, allowing him all along, as a mark of his e&s;teem, the large Pen&s;ion which he enjoy'd in Per|&s;ia.</P>
<P>But after that, upon the death of <HI>Abouel-kazi</HI> the Crown de&s;|cended to his Son <HI>Enouch Kaan,</HI> or the <HI>Lord of Profit, Habas</HI> the Second, who had not that e&s;teem for him which he had for his Father, thought him&s;elf no longer oblig'd to continue the Pen|&s;ion, which he had given his Father meerly in kindne&s;s. Where|upon <HI>Enouch-Kaan,</HI> who look'd upon that Pen&s;ion as a &s;ort of
<PB N="119" REF="280">
Tribute which the Per&s;ian Monarch paid the King of <HI>Careckme</HI> or <HI>Orquenge</HI> to keep him from Plundring his Territories, finding him&s;elf fru&s;trated of his expectation, thought the &s;ure&s;t way to recover it, or at lea&s;t to recompence him&s;elf for his lo&s;&s;es, would be to carry the War into the Empire, and to Ravage the Frontier Provinces. To which purpo&s;e he enters into a League with the two other <HI>Kaans</HI> again&s;t Per&s;ia, and the better to cement it, he e&s;pou&s;es the Si&s;ter of the Sovereign Prince of <HI>Balke,</HI> and gives his own Si&s;ter in Marriage to the King of <HI>Bokora;</HI> which done, the three brothers-in-law re&s;olve to fall altogether into the Per&s;ian Dominions.</P>
<P>There was only one &s;cruple that troubl'd the Prince of <HI>Balk</HI> and <HI>Bokora,</HI> which was, that the deceas'd King of <HI>Orquenge,</HI> the Father of the pre&s;ent King, was a <HI>Shia</HI> Mahumetan, according to the Per&s;ian Wor&s;hip, and not a <HI>Sunni</HI> Mahumetan according to the Wor&s;hip both of the Turks and Tartars. <HI>Enouch Caan</HI> there|fore makes open Profe&s;&s;ion of the Religion of his Country, and of having quitted his Fathers belief. But the two Princes mi&s;tru&s;t|ing his &s;incerity, and fearing he would play 'em &s;ome &s;curvy trick or other, the better to a&s;&s;ure them&s;elves that he was a true <HI>Sunnie,</HI> that he was real in his proceedings, and that he was from the bottom of his heart a declar'd Enemy of Per&s;ia, they were de&s;irous that he &s;hould fir&s;t begin the War, and fall in with all his Forces into the Kingdom, and the next year they agreed they would all three joyn together to advance their Conque&s;ts. According to this Re&s;olution the Prince of <HI>Orquenge</HI> enters the Kingdom, but met with too powerful a re&s;i&s;tance. For <HI>Habas</HI> II. being inform'd of the Con&s;piracies of the&s;e pettie Kings, had Vow'd their Ruine, and not only to repel their Incur&s;ions, but to make an ab&s;olute Conque&s;t of their Territories, to deprive them of Life and Scepters both together, and unite the Province of <HI>Balk</HI> to the Empire. For this rea&s;on it was that in the year 1665. according to our account he undertook his Progre&s;s into <HI>Mazenderan,</HI> and march'd again&s;t 'em. The <HI>Yusbecks</HI> perceiving the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> at hand, and apprehen&s;ive of his Power, fail'd in the great Courage which they pretended at the beginning, and thought it their better cour&s;e to &s;ubmit. So that the next year, 1666. they &s;ent every one their Emba&s;&s;adors to beg a Peace, and by that means in &s;ome mea&s;ure a&s;&s;wag'd the Indignation of that Prince, and &s;u&s;pended tho&s;e de&s;igns which he had contriv'd in his thoughts, and which by his death not long after happening, prov'd altogether abortive.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="281">
After his unfortunate death, the <HI>Tartars</HI> took heart again. Be|&s;ides, the weak Government of a young Prince who&s;e age and want of experience render'd him uncapable to oppo&s;e their de|&s;igns, was &s;uch a favourable Opportunity that they could not forbear to take the advantage of it. And therefore the Prince of <HI>Orquenge,</HI> like a hungry Lion, in the year 1667. enter'd <HI>Merve Sava,</HI> and the Country round about; where finding no re&s;i&s;tance; he made &s;trange Havock, and carry'd away what|ever he found to be of value, not one <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Governour daring to oppo&s;e him. Nor indeed could the Governours prevent it, for the&s;e <HI>Tartars</HI> are like Birds of Prey, flying from the Place they have plunder'd with that &s;wiftne&s;s, before a man can &s;u&s;pect 'em to have been there; be&s;ides that they had not a &s;ufficient force to oppo&s;e a furious Multitude, whom Revenge and hope of Booty had fle&s;h'd and animated beyond the &s;en&s;e of fear or danger.</P>
<P>The Court having intelligence of the&s;e di&s;orders took a re|&s;olution to apply Remedies; but it was &s;o remi&s;sly and &s;lowly executed, that they who had an in&s;ight into things fore&s;aw it would come to nothing, as indeed it came to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>The Council of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> under the Kings name, made choice of two Lords, e&s;teem'd to be Per&s;onages of the greate&s;t Expe|rience in the Kingdom, the one called <HI>Clichs-Kaan,</HI> and the other <HI>Sheik-Hali-Kaan,</HI> both the one and the other already provided of two of the be&s;t Governments in the Empire; the fir&s;t of the Province of <HI>Kirmaan,</HI> or <HI>Caramania,</HI> the other of <HI>Kirmoon Sha,</HI> which is <HI>Caldea.</HI> The&s;e Lords were &s;ent for from their Government, which were di&s;pos'd of, the one to the Bro|ther, the other to the Son of tho&s;e Lords; and they them&s;elves were &s;ent again&s;t the <HI>Yusbeck,</HI> with the Title of Generals of the Army. They march'd with four thou&s;and men from <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> to joyn the Army that lay ready in the Province of <HI>Cora&s;&s;on;</HI> and in regard there was no more talk of the <HI>Indian</HI> War, the Governour of <HI>Candaar,</HI> had order to &s;upply the Generals with what Recruits they &s;hould think nece&s;&s;ary. Six weeks after the departure of the&s;e Lords, with their &s;mall Body of four thou&s;and men; &s;everal Sums of Money were &s;ent to <HI>Cora&s;&s;on</HI> to pay both the Armies, as well that belonging to the Province as the <HI>Indian</HI> Recruits. This Trea&s;ure was convoy'd only by two hundred Men, in regard there was no appearance of any dan|ger upon the Road; and yet, however it came to pa&s;s, the <HI>Yusbecks</HI> had intelligence of it. Thereupon they &s;ent out a Party to ob&s;erve the motion of the Convoy, and took their
<PB N="121" REF="281">
opportunity &s;o well, that with three thou&s;and of their own Peo|ple they carri'd off the Booty, notwith&s;tanding all the &s;peed that was made to overtake 'em.</P>
<P>During the&s;e Troubles <HI>Hali-Kouli-Kaan</HI> departed this Life of a &s;toppage in his Brea&s;t, for which no remedy could be found, after he had kept his Bed four days. In the Story of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> which we intend one day for the Pre&s;s, we have given an account of his Birth, and his Misfortunes; for it was a won|derful thing, that whatever faults he were guilty of, and he committed a great many, <HI>Habas</HI> II. &s;till pardon'd him: he never would reduce him to utmo&s;t mi&s;ery, much le&s;s put him to death; becau&s;e of the good tydings of which he had been the Me&s;&s;enger to him. For this &s;ame Lord it was, whom <HI>Se|phi</HI> I. the Father of <HI>Habas,</HI> perceiving his Di&s;temper grow up|on him, &s;ent to fetch the young Prince out of the Womens Palace, to the end he might have him ready near his per&s;on, out of a de&s;ign which he had to pre&s;ent him to the Lords for his Suc|ce&s;&s;our. Never had any man run through &s;o many &s;trange adventures in fifty years that he belong'd to the Court, and &s;eventy of his Life; nor did ever any man experience the fickle|ne&s;s of Fanta&s;tick Fortune in her &s;ports of Pro&s;perity and Ad|ver&s;ity &s;o much as he did.</P>
<P>At the time of his Decea&s;e he was advanc'd to the highe&s;t Pinacle that ever his good fortune could rai&s;e him. He was in the entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the affection and favours of his Ma&s;ter, who refus'd him nothing. His Maje&s;ty was never weary of his Bounty toward him; and &s;ix weeks before his death had pre|&s;ented him with a Sword, a Dagger, and three Heron Tufts, valu'd in all at fifty thou&s;and Crowns. But the&s;e outward Marks of Favour were of little value to the high-priz'd Power which he had over the thoughts and actions of the Prince, who di&s;patch'd no bu&s;ine&s;s of Importance before he had taken his Advice. So that it might be &s;aid, that the General was the true Monarch of the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> while he that carri'd the Title was but the &s;hadow of the Sovereign. And therefore it was that he liv'd like a Monarch; there being nothing that appear'd about him, that betray'd the lea&s;t di&s;covery of a private For|tune; for he entertain'd fifteen hundred men about his Per&s;on, be&s;ides Officers and Eunuchs, of which three hundred at a time mounted his Guards. He got by his Government of <HI>Tau|ris,</HI> and his Fees, as <HI>Generali&s;&s;imo,</HI> thirty thou&s;and <HI>Tomans,</HI> or one hundred and twenty thou&s;and pounds; of which he laid a&s;ide the one half for the payment of his fifteen hundred men,
<PB N="122" REF="282">
whom he always took care to have in good Equipage; the re&s;t went to defray the charges of his Hou&s;e-keeping. He had al&s;o &s;et up for his own u&s;e in his Palace &s;everal <HI>Kaar-Kaan&egrave;</HI> or Work|hou&s;es for all &s;orts of Manufactures, where he had mu&s;ter'd to|gether Workmen and Artificers in all manner of Trades; Gold&s;miths, Tailors, Sadlers, Armourers, Burni&s;hers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> be|&s;ides Riders for his Hor&s;es, and Ma&s;ters to teach his men how to handle their Arms. In a word, his Palace was altogether Royal. And in this manner was he at continual Expences; in&s;omuch, that notwith&s;tanding his large Revenue he always was poor and in debt. For be&s;ides that he was of a prodigal humour, having neither Wives nor Children to provide for, he never &s;par'd for Lu&s;tre and Pomp upon all occa&s;ions that re|quir'd it. Nor will it be ami&s;s, con&s;idering the high degree that he held in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and the Fanta&s;tick Traver&s;es as well in his Fortune, as in the Con&s;equences of his Conduct, to give the Reader a Portraiture of his Per&s;on.</P>
<P>He was of a middle &s;tature, rather enclining to be tall then low: his A&s;pect grim and terrible, yet without any deformity. He wore his <HI>Mon&s;tachios</HI> very thick, and about three quarters of a foot long: and tho three&s;core and ten years of Age he never us'd Spectacles, and all his other Sen&s;es equally as vigorous as his &s;ight. He perform'd his Exerci&s;es as duly as the young men: nor was he inferiour to any other per&s;on what&s;oever in handling his Bow, his Sword, and other Weapons; which made him always to be look'd upon as a brave Souldier: but the more Intelligent &s;ort ne|ver believ'd him a good Captain; looking upon him to be fitter for Coun&s;el then Execution. He was endu'd with a mixture of Qualities that rarely meet together: on the one &s;ide haughty and Cholerick; on the other, &s;ubtle and a deep di&s;&s;embler; he knew the proper &s;ea&s;on to &s;hew the violence of his Revenge, and how to take his Mea&s;ures to the ruine of his Competitors. He could not endure to be contradicted: and it was the misfortune and the greate&s;t trouble in the World to his Servants, that when he ask'd for any thing, it was a crime to tell him it was not to be had: for without reply they mu&s;t either put a force upon the very Sea&s;ons of the Year and Fortune her &s;elf to &s;atisfie him, or el&s;e expect to have their bones broken with Ba&s;tinadoes. Setting that humour a&s;ide, he was affable enough, e&s;pecially to &s;trangers: to them he was ea&s;ie of acce&s;s, and readily granted 'em the favours which they reque&s;ted. He could neither write nor read in any other Language then his own Natural <HI>Georgian.</HI> He was a lover of Sciences, tho he under&s;tood 'em not. He
<PB N="123" REF="282">
was very much addicted to Predictions and Fortune-telling. And out of an extraordinary want of judgment gave more credit to a Progno&s;tication then to &s;ound Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day he di'd he was laid in a Mo&s;que clo&s;e by his Palace; from whence &s;ome few days after, he was carri'd to <HI>Met&s;hed,</HI> there to be interr'd under the protection of that great <HI>Mahometan</HI> Saint, who formerly had liv'd there, and made choice of that place for his Sepulchre. It is a thing which we may well wonder at, were it not a thing frequent among us, in re|gard the&s;e &s;udden alterations are to be &s;een as well in our own as in the Ea&s;tern Courts. For as &s;oon as his dead body was carri'd out of his Palace, about &s;ix hours after he had giv'n up the Gho&s;t; that very Hou&s;e which the day before could hard|ly contain the Croud that re&s;orted to it, was &s;o wholly de&s;erted that there was hardly one of all that numerous Family that en|viron'd him while alive, left to tell a man what was become of their Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>His death caus'd a great alteration at Court, tho no body was troubl'd at it but the King, who had a particular kindne&s;s for him. But there were an infinite number that rejoyc'd at it; e&s;pecially they who having &s;ome &s;hare in the favour of which he depriv'd 'em the full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, now hop'd to make more room for them&s;elves. So that the Grandees at Court began to take new Mea&s;ures, and in the mid&s;t of tho&s;e delu&s;ions with which their Ambition flatter'd 'em, every one fanci'd to him&s;elf more daring hopes.</P>
<P>The Death of this Per&s;on, which did not a little afflict the King, was accompanied with other Tidings no le&s;s unwel|come; That the <HI>Kalmachs,</HI> a fierce and untameable People, had declar'd open War again&s;t <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> Whereupon the Go|vernours of <HI>E&s;ter-abaat,</HI> which is the Ea&s;tern <HI>Hircania,</HI> be&s;ought his Maje&s;ty to &s;end 'em requi&s;ite A&s;&s;i&s;tance.

their Frontiers, between <HI>Orquenge</HI> and <HI>E&s;ther-abaat:</HI> and the&s;e People our Modern Autohrs call <HI>Tureomans,</HI> which are properly <HI>Turks.</HI> For the&s;e People, and tho&s;e that hold the Empire of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> came at fir&s;t from <HI>Turq-E&s;taan,</HI> that is to &s;ay, from tho&s;e Provinces of <HI>Tartary,</HI> which are very va&s;t, altho we have but little knowledge of 'em.

For that among them <HI>Turk</HI> &s;ignifies one that comes from tho&s;e High-lands of <HI>Tartary,</HI> let it be from what part it will. The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> therefore to define tho&s;e <HI>Turkmans</HI> more di&s;tinctly, call 'em <HI>Sara-Net&s;hin.

<P>But to make a true relation of a Country, it is nece&s;&s;ary that they who de&s;cribe it &s;hould know the Language; el&s;e they mu&s;t commit a thou&s;and errors not pa&s;&s;able among per&s;ons of Judgment, of which there needs no other proof, then &s;uch Rela|tions of Travels which we have &s;een printed in this Age: Not to mention any other then tho&s;e of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> of which there are two which are indifferently tolerable; <HI>Valle</HI>'s and the Travels of <HI>Olearius:</HI> though the fir&s;t be full of faults, which may be &s;aid to be Mon&s;trous; and the latter be not altogether exempt. And yet they are better then the re&s;t, in regard tho&s;e Authors under|&s;tood the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Language; and therefore it is my Opinion, that whoever publi&s;hes his Travels, and Ob&s;ervations of a Country, of which he has not learnt the Speech, &s;hall never make any per|fect and accompli&s;h'd.

<P>But to return to our &s;tory, this <HI>Colony</HI> of <HI>Turcmans</HI> was for|merly Tributary to the <HI>Calmachs;</HI> but about thirty years ago they took Sanctuary in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> &s;ubmitting under the Government
<PB N="125" REF="283">
of tho&s;e Princes who commanded the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Empire, to avoid the oppre&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Calmachs</HI> and to find out a le&s;s Barren Re|gion, and more proper to feed their Flocks. During all which Interval of time the <HI>Calmachs</HI> had taken no notice of the <HI>Turc|mans,</HI> but in the year 1667. judging <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> to be in a weak con|dition, under a young Prince, to the end they might have a pre|tence for a War, they &s;ent to demand Re&s;titution of the Tri|bute which the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Monarch had receiv'd for thirty years to|gether of the <HI>Turkman,</HI> whom they alledg'd to be their Subjects. So &s;oon as their Commi&s;&s;ioners were arriv'd at <HI>E&s;ther-abaat,</HI> which is the fir&s;t con&s;iderable City of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> on that &s;ide, the Go|vernor detain'd 'em, and a&s;&s;ur'd 'em he would both &s;end to in|form the Court of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> concerning the occa&s;ion of their com|ing, and give 'em an account of the an&s;wer back. Immediately the Kings Council were all of opinion to reject with &s;corn a de|mand &s;o affrontive to the Grandeur of the Empire. Which Re&s;olu|tion was without doubt the mo&s;t honourable and made mo&s;t noi&s;e, but not the wi&s;e&s;t. For the <HI>Calmachs</HI> no le&s;s highly offended when they under&s;tood the an&s;wer return'd, came towards the end of the Campagne to the Frontiers that &s;eparate the two Domini|ons, and there in a mo&s;t &s;olemn manner &s;hot an Arrow into the Territories of the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> which is the Signal they u&s;e in decla|ring open War again&s;t any of their Neighbours. To which War, what i&s;&s;ue Heaven ordain'd we &s;hall below make known.</P>
<P>All tho&s;e Wars that threaten'd <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> in this &s;ame langui&s;hing and feeble condition wherein it was, were the rea&s;on that the Court would not li&s;ten to the Propo&s;itions of the Ba&s;ha of <HI>Bas|ra,</HI> vulgarly tho erroneou&s;ly call'd <HI>Balzura,</HI> a City &s;eated at the mouth of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Gulph; wherein for &s;everal years toge|ther the &s;aid <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> had a&s;&s;um'd to him&s;elf a kind of Sovereign Dignity: while he, acknowledging no Supreme, &s;o well ma|nag'd his affairs in the mid&s;t of tho&s;e two Monarchs, between whom he lay, the Turk and Per&s;ian; that the de&s;ire which both had to ruin him, made for his pre&s;ervation. For when the Turk had a de&s;ign to fall upon him he offer'd him&s;elf to the Per&s;ian; at what time the Turk being unwilling that the Per&s;ian his Enemy &s;hould become Ma&s;ter of &s;uch a Territory, and rather choo&s;ing that they &s;hould remain under Subjection to a Neuter Prince, forbore to mole&s;t him; and when the Per&s;ian &s;ummon'd him to give an account for breach of his promi&s;es; with the &s;ame policy he threaten'd to &s;urrender to the Turk. And then the Per&s;ian fearing le&s;t the Turk, already two potent, &s;hould enlarge his Em|pire by the addition of the&s;e Territories, were unwilling to give
<PB N="126" REF="284">
him a di&s;turbance &s;o highly provoking: and &s;everal of the&s;e tricks did the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> play during the Reign of <HI>Habas</HI> II.</P>
<P>After his decea&s;e, the Turks de&s;irous to take the opportunity of <HI>Sephie</HI> II. being come young and newly to the Crown, to make an attempt upon <HI>Ba&s;-ra</HI> in the &s;ame manner as thirty years be|fore. Sultan <HI>Mourad</HI> whom we call <HI>Murat,</HI> took hold of the oc|ca&s;ion, <HI>Sephy</HI> I. being newly advanc'd to the Throne, to Be|&s;iege <HI>Babylon;</HI> &s;o that altho he were then bu&s;ied in the War of <HI>Candia,</HI> he undertook that Conque&s;t al&s;o, and to that effect gave orders to the Ba&s;has of <HI>Diarbekre, Mou&s;&s;ol, Alep, Merdin,</HI> and other Governors on that &s;ide, to march again&s;t <HI>Ba&s;-ra,</HI> every one with an embody'd Army, of which he appointed the Ba&s;ha of <HI>Bagdat</HI> or <HI>Babylon</HI> to be General.</P>
<P><HI>Ho&s;&s;ein-Ba&s;ha</HI> (for &s;o was the petty Sovereign of <HI>Ba&s;-ra</HI> call'd) &s;ends away into Per&s;ia to make the &s;ame Offer which he had al|ready made &s;o many times before to <HI>Habas</HI> II. But he was not in being; and his Succe&s;&s;or minded only his plea&s;ures, and had no in|clination for War. However, the chief Mini&s;ters, unwilling to di&s;cover the weakne&s;s of their pre&s;ent condition, an&s;wer'd the Amba&s;&s;adors that they had no encouragement to hearken to their Propo&s;itions, after the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> their Ma&s;ter had &s;o frequent|ly and &s;o in&s;olently baffled the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Monarchy. That he had drawn his own misfortunes him&s;elf upon his own head, and that his &s;ufferings were no more then what he well de&s;erv'd. However, the Ba&s;ha nothing di&s;courag'd for having mi&s;s'd the Succours which he expected on that &s;ide, betook him&s;elf to an|other Stratagem, and being a per&s;on that had heap'd a va&s;t Trea&s;ure together by his Merchandize, he now employs it to corrupt the Ba&s;ha of <HI>Bagdat</HI> General of the Turki&s;h Army and the re&s;t of the Grand Officers. Thereupon he treats with 'em, upon condition of being Tributary, for the future, to the Grand Seignior, to pay him every year a hundred thou&s;and Crowns, and to give him in ready Money two hundred thou&s;and upon the naile: &s;ome other conditions were likewi&s;e added of &s;mall im|portance, and &s;o the Siege being rais'd, and the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> &s;ent his Son|in-law to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> to have the Treaty ratifi'd, which was all that happen'd in reference to this War in the year 1667.</P>
<P>Toward the end of the &s;ame year arriv'd &s;ad tidings at <HI>I&s;pa|han</HI> from the Provinces adjoyning to the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, that at <HI>Shirvan,</HI> the Capital City of a Province of the &s;ame Name, and which makes a part of <HI>Armenia</HI> the greater, were <HI>Tefflis,</HI> the Ca|pital City of <HI>Georgia,</HI> an Earthquake had overturn'd the greate&s;t part of that City, and ruin'd four Villages near adjoyning: and
<PB N="127" REF="284">
and that above thirty thou&s;and <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> had peri&s;h'd in the Ru|ines. That in another City call'd <HI>Shama-Ki,</HI> in the Province of the &s;ame name, which is the Southern <HI>Media,</HI> another Earth|quake altogether as dreadful as the former, had occa&s;ion'd the lo&s;s of twenty thou&s;and Per&s;ons, and &s;wallow'd up three fourth parts of the City; which two accidents had reduc'd tho&s;e two Provinees to utter De&s;olation.</P>
<P>I do not believe there was any more then one per&s;on in the World that could rejoyce at the&s;e di&s;mal tidings, and that was <HI>Mirza-Ibraim,</HI> already mention'd; although as being Royal Far|mer of the latter Province he ought to have been afflicted rather at his lo&s;s. However, he look'd upon the &s;ad event with a joy|ful heart, as being that which offer'd him more an opportunity to get rid of his troubles and per&s;ecutions which he &s;u&s;tain'd in the Court of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and to get out of <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> which he lookt upon as a kind of confinement, or to &s;peak more truly as his place of Tor|ment; nor did he neglect the opportunity, but pre&s;ented forthwith a Petition to the King and the Chief Mini&s;ters, wherein he de|clar'd that <HI>Shamaky</HI> was dependent upon his imployment, and therefore be&s;ought his Maje&s;ty that he might return thither to &s;ee what might be done to recover it out of its Ruins.</P>
<P>He back'd his Petition with &s;everal con&s;iderable Pre&s;ents which he made to the chief Mini&s;ters, and by that means obtain'd a Grant of his de&s;ires. And thus did that unfortunate Lord de|lay for a time the bad effects of his unfortunate Ambition. Cer|tain it is that for &s;ix months that he &s;taid at Court, the King and Prime Mini&s;ters under various pretences got from him above &s;ixty thou&s;and <HI>Tomans,</HI> which amount to two hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds, and all the while they contemn'd him as a Cul|ly and a Per&s;on of no value. Infamy attended him every where; and not only the Grandees but per&s;ons of ordinary condition took delight to make &s;port with him, as if he had been one of the dregs of the People. For being a man that was very Co|vetous, and yet one that his misfortunes had rendred extremely fearful, they who had any thing to receive of him, and to whom he had made over A&s;&s;ignations upon his Farm, could find no bet|ter way to make him bleed then to abu&s;e and affront him. And I was inform'd by &s;ome per&s;ons who were able to tell me, that upon &s;ome di&s;order at Court how to rai&s;e money, the <HI>Divan Beki,</HI> or <HI>Chief Ju&s;tice</HI> gave the King to under&s;tand in a Memorial which he pre&s;ented him, that if his Maje&s;ty would but deliver up into his power <HI>Mirza Ibrahim,</HI> and <HI>Mirza Sadek</HI> his Brother, he would lo&s;e his head if he did not rai&s;e him a Sum of &s;ix hundred
<PB N="128" REF="285">
thou&s;and <HI>Tomans,</HI> which are two Millions and a half Sterlin. It happen'd that at the &s;ame time when this Memorial was deli|ver'd this unfortunate Lord was in the Hall, where his Maje&s;ty &s;ate, who thereupon caus'd the Memorial to be read aloud. It may be ea&s;ily judg'd in what a taking he was; but without an&s;wering a word, he patiently endur'd the puni&s;hment of his ra&s;h Ambition, and want of Conduct. In a word, he was a lo&s;t man, and his mi&s;ery had encreas'd to its full height, had not the conjuncture of the Earthquake furni&s;h'd him with an opportu|nity to beg leave to retire. So that in &s;ome mea&s;ure his good fortune proceeded from an event which at another time might have prov'd mo&s;t prejudicial to him. Yet as I have already &s;aid mo&s;t prudent per&s;ons believe, that he has only delay'd his evil De&s;tiny for &s;ome years, that his ruin is infallible, and that up|on the lea&s;t want of money, he will &s;till be the Prey in the eyes of the Hungry Courtiers.</P>
<P>The year 1668. according to our account, and 1079. accor|ding to the Mahumetan Computation, began with great Rejoy|cing, the Prince imagining that the re&s;t of the year would be no le&s;s happy then the beginning. But it fell not out an&s;werable to his ex|pectations: nor that of the Grandees of the Kingdom, as well as tho&s;e of meaner Condition, who had any in&s;ight into Affairs: tho to out|ward appearance they attended at the Fe&s;tivals with a chearful countenance, yet their hearts were not &s;o light: for they found the condition of the Empire grew every day wor&s;e and wor&s;e; that the Enemy was in the Bowels of &s;everal Provinces, while others were laid de&s;olate by Earthquakes: little Money in the Kingdom, a &s;carcity &s;till continu'd at <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> where tho there was no want; of any thing, yet every thing was &s;old at an exce&s;&s;ive rate. The Exchequer moreover was exhau&s;ted, while the new Prince in eighteen Months had drain'd all the Trea&s;ures of the Empire. Which happen'd through his Profu&s;ion on the one &s;ide, either by rea&s;on of the prodigious Expences that he delighted in, or through the exce&s;&s;ive Pre&s;ents which frequently, and many times with|out any Rea&s;on at all, he heap'd upon his Favourites. And on the other &s;ide, through the little care that was taken of the ma|nagement of his Revenues: For indeed he had not made the third part of what his Father was wont to make of 'em; as having without con&s;idering the con&s;equences, fill'd up all the vacant Employments both in the Court and in the Countrys. Where|as his Father never &s;upply'd tho&s;e Vacancies unle&s;s he was thereto compell'd by nece&s;&s;ity, to the end he might have the Money him&s;elf w^c^h was due to his Officers. But the young Monarch little
<PB N="129" REF="285">
experienc'd in Government, imagin'd that the Coffers which he found full would never be empty. Nor dur&s;t any body be &s;o bold as to tell him 'twas much more ea&s;ie to empty then to fill 'em. But at length when they found him wondring that Money was not plentiful with him as it had been, they were con&s;train'd to let him under&s;tand the rea&s;on.</P>
<P>The Dutche&s;s his Mother, for whom he had an extraordi|nary re&s;pect, and who might be &s;aid to be more then his Go|verne&s;s, &s;poke with more freedom to him then any other per&s;on, and made him conde&s;cend to let her act in the publick manage|ment of Affairs. Thereupon &s;he took upon her the Govern|ment of the Empire, and to &s;hew her fir&s;t Ma&s;ter-piece of Po|licy, &s;he reduc'd the Monarch her Son from one extremity to another. In&s;omuch that whereas he was &s;o extremely liberal before, that he was always and upon all occa&s;ions giving, afterwards he became covetous even to pitiful &s;ordidne&s;s: and was &s;o far from being bountiful that he hardly rewarded tho&s;e that did him extraordinary &s;ervices. So that it might be &s;aid of him, that he was like &s;ome Torrents that over|flow the Meadows to day, and the next leave 'em quite dry.</P>
<P>All the&s;e di&s;orders oblig'd the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> to look backward, and to wi&s;h for the days of the decea&s;ed Kings Reign. And they were taken with the An&s;wer which the late General of the Armies, when he liv'd in &s;uch &s;plendour and high favour at Court, made the King; For one day the Prince and he being private together, <HI>Hali-Kouli-Kaan</HI> &s;aid the King to him, <HI>Do&s;t thou not know who they were that rejoyc'd at the death of the King my Father? If I knew who the Dogs were, I would cau&s;e their guts to be ripp'd up.</HI> To whom the Lord with his u&s;ual boldne&s;s &s;aid: <HI>Your Maje&s;ty will do well to take care what you do, le&s;t you begin with your &s;elf and me: For I know none but our &s;elves to whom his Death could be acceptable; by which, of Pri&s;oners that we were, we became Kings of</HI> Per&s;ia.</P>
<P>Nor had the King his Health this year any better then the year before. His Di&s;temper &s;till perplex'd him, tho his fits were always alike, &s;ome quickly off, others more tedious. Sometimes he lay whole Weeks together langui&s;hing in his <HI>Haram,</HI> whence he never &s;tirr'd out at his u&s;ual times, but a little now and then in the Evening to &s;hew him&s;elf: Sometimes he took the Air a Hor&s;eback with a Handkerchief ty'd three or four times about his neck, which in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> is the certain &s;ign of a &s;ick Per&s;on. However all this while he forbore nothing of his debaucheries,
<PB N="130" REF="286">
and always carri'd his Women along with him; his mo&s;t u&s;ual Walks being upon <HI>Giulfa</HI> &s;ide, a Town belonging to the <HI>Arme|nians,</HI> out of which he pick'd all the hand&s;om Virgins to fill his Palace. It is &s;aid, the fir&s;t time that he caus'd the young Virgins under twelve and above ten years of Age to be thus cull d out, of twenty that were carri'd to the Palace there was but one that &s;hew'd the lea&s;t joy in her Countenance for her good fortune, and &s;he was detain'd; the re&s;t who fell a weeping, either becau&s;e they were thought too Innocent, or el&s;e believ'd to be too cunning, were re&s;tor'd to their Parents. But to the Father of her that was detain'd the Sum of Eight <HI>Tomans,</HI> or thirty Guinees Pen&s;ion was pre&s;ently order'd. For it is the Cu|&s;tom of that Court, when the King makes choice of any Vir|gin out of a Family that is not very well in the World, he a&s;&s;igns the Father a Pen&s;ion to that value, or near it, during his Life. I &s;ay, when a Family is low in the World: For as for the Grandees, they count it a great happine&s;s to have a Kin&s;|woman in the Kings hou&s;e, where &s;he may be u&s;eful to him in his advancement, and do him a thou&s;and good Offices near his Maje&s;ties Per&s;on.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s the Young Prince had forborn Wine all the la&s;t year, by rea&s;on of an Inflammation in his Throat occa&s;ion'd by his hard drinking; with which his Father al&s;o had formerly been troubl'd for the &s;ame cau&s;e. Which was the Rea&s;on that the <HI>Kourouk</HI> or Prohibition of Wine was renew'd, to the end there might be no more &s;old. For it is the Cu&s;tom of the Grandees in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> when they have an Intention to abandon Wine, they &s;end Orders to throw away all that they have, and to knock out the heads of the Ve&s;&s;els, to the end that if they &s;hould have a de&s;ire to drink it again, they might not have an opportunity to &s;atisfie them&s;elves; not looking upon them&s;elves to be Ma&s;ters of their Pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding all this Ab&s;tinence of the Young Prince, his Di&s;tempers nothing abated. His pale and wan Colour, and his Stomach loathing all manner of Food, were certain Sym|ptomes of his di&s;order'd Body.</P>
<P>His Chief Phy&s;ician knew not what to think: he had e&s;&s;ay'd in vain all the &s;ecrets of his Art: which was no &s;mall affliction to him, in regard his life depended upon the Kings: Or if his life were &s;par'd, yet he was &s;ure to lo&s;e his E&s;tate and his Liberty: as happen'd to the two Chief Phy&s;icians of <HI>Habas</HI> II. and as it happens to all tho&s;e that attend the <HI>A&s;iatick</HI> Sovereigns, when they die under their care.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="286">
The A&s;trologers al&s;o began to whi&s;per one another in the Ear, and tell their Confidents, as a great &s;ecret, that the King would never recover; that they could not find in his Horo|&s;cope that he had above &s;ix years to live after his Coronation, of which he had already &s;urviv'd a third part; and that he &s;hould langui&s;h out the two others in perpetual mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>The Queen Mother, pre&s;s'd by her natural affection, and blinded by the tran&s;ports of her Pa&s;&s;ion, forbore to lay the fault upon her Sons di&s;temper; but quarrell'd with the Phy&s;ician, asking him how it came to pa&s;s her Son was &s;ick, accus'd him of Trea|&s;on or Ignorance, believing that &s;ince he was her Son's Phy&s;ician, he was oblig'd to cure him. This made the Phy&s;ician at his Wits end, &s;o that all his Receipts failing him, he bethought him|&s;elf of one that was peculiarly his own Invention, and which few Phy&s;icians would ever have found out, as not being to be met with neither in <HI>Galen</HI> nor <HI>Hippocrates.</HI> What does he then do, but out of an extraordinary fetch of his Wit, he begins to lay the fault upon the Stars, and the <HI>Mun&s;hi-Zumes,</HI> or Kings A&s;trologers, crying out that they were altogether in the wrong. That if the King lay in a langui&s;hing condition, and could not recover his health, it was becau&s;e they had fail'd to ob&s;erve the happy hour, or the A&s;pect of a Fortunate Con&s;tel|lation at the Time of his Coronation. Which Fable was back'd by all the friends which the Phy&s;ician had at Court; and be&s;ides that, by one of the Kings A&s;trologers him&s;elf, call'd <HI>Mirza Mougiim.</HI> For this per&s;on either out of Emulation, or for what other rea&s;on I know not, bearing a private grudge to the Prince of the A&s;trologers, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it was to ob&s;erve the favourable Conjunction for the Coronation of the young Prince, and perceiving &s;o fit an opportunity to di&s;credit the Chief of the A&s;trologers, and advance his own Reputation, fail'd not to lay hold of it.</P>
<P>He therefore made it out, or at lea&s;t &s;eem'd to make it plain by long di&s;putes full of A&s;trological Rea&s;ons, in all the chief A&s;&s;emblies of the chief Courtiers, that the Moment de&s;ign'd for the Coronation of the King &s;ignifi'd nothing; and after|wards by Arguments as &s;trong as the fir&s;t, he labour'd to prove that the defect of the Kings health proceeded from his Coronation which had been &s;olemniz'd under an Inau&s;picious A&s;pect.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t that gave credit to his idle &s;tories were the Mother and the Son; and the Women that were &s;uffer'd to be near his Maje&s;ty were of the &s;ame opinion likewi&s;e, that it was the fault
<PB N="132" REF="287">
of the Star-Gazer, who had not taken notice that the A&s;pect was not favourable at that time. The Eunuchs al&s;o were drawn into the &s;ame belief, and the Courtiers who are &s;till ready to comply with the mo&s;t extravagant Propo&s;als, to plea&s;e their Ma&s;ter, declar'd no le&s;s. In &s;hort the Phy&s;ician got the day, and by this Chimera &s;av'd his Credit and his E&s;tate.</P>
<P>'Twas in vain for the A&s;trologer, by the mo&s;t convincing Arguments he could alledge, to maintain the contrary. No body gave ear to him; &s;o that he was con&s;train'd, for fear of running him&s;elf into farther danger, not only to hold his peace, but at length to applaud the Sentence pronouncd again&s;t him.</P>
<P>Therefore there was nothing now to be done but to repair a pretended defect, and to &s;eek out proper remedies for the mi&s;take: nor could they find any other Expedient but to proceed to a &s;e|cond Coronation of the King, as if he had never been Crown'd before. It was re&s;olv'd al&s;o at the &s;ame time, that his Maje&s;ty &s;hould quit the name of <HI>Sephi&egrave;,</HI> as carrying in it &s;omewhat I know not what of unfortunate; and that he &s;hould make choice of another. They gave his Maje&s;ty therefore to under&s;tand, that the beginning of his Grandfathers Reign had been accom|pani'd with the &s;ame accidents as his own. That there was a great &s;carcity of Provi&s;ion in <HI>I&s;pahan;</HI> that the Turks had declar'd War again&s;t him, and that he had never enjoy'd a perfect health.</P>
<P>The&s;e two things being thus re&s;olv'd, the next thing was to pitch upon the day. Upon this Point there was a long de|liberation, and many Conte&s;ts about it. The A&s;trologers were con&s;ulted: and at length after many Con&s;ultations and &s;erious Enquiries, they agreed that the happy Hour which was to be attended by &s;o many fortunate Events, would be toward the time of the year that the Sun enter'd the <HI>Ram:</HI> which accord|ding to our account was <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the twentieth of <HI>March,</HI> about nine in the Morning.</P>
<P>At for this &s;econd Coronation, in regard it vari'd little or no|thing from the former, it will be needle&s;s to make a &s;econd de&s;cription of it: All the difference was, that this &s;econd Coro|nation was &s;olemniz'd in the great Hall, call'd <HI>T&s;hehel Setoon,</HI> or <HI>the Hall with forty Pillars.</HI> Which is that Magnificent Apart|ment, the mo&s;t &s;tately in all the Royal Palace, by us de&s;crib'd with all po&s;&s;ible exactne&s;s in our de&s;cription of <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI> There the whole Court met at the time prefix'd by the A&s;trologers with all the Pomp that &s;uch a glorious Ceremony requir'd. All
<PB N="133" REF="287">
the Grandees of the Court who had the priviledge of &s;itting before the King, plac'd them&s;elves upon the Right hand. The two Pontiffs, the mo&s;t eminent Interpreters of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and all the Tribe of <HI>Molla</HI>'s &s;tood upon the Left. When all the Court was &s;ate, and that there was no body el&s;e to come, every one ob&s;erving a profound &s;ilence, the King enter'd from the far|ther part of the Hall, and &s;ate down: In a &s;hort time after, upon a a &s;ignal given, they all ro&s;e; and then the Ceremony it &s;elf was perform'd as before related. <HI>Mahamed-Baquer-Cora&s;ini</HI> made the Sermon of four parts, and the <HI>Koth&egrave;</HI> the Prayer, at the end of which, exalting his Voice, he gave the Prince a new Name, which was that of <HI>Soleimaan.</HI> Which name being once pronounc'd, every one, as at the fir&s;t Ceremony, gave their <HI>Int&s;h-Alla, &s;o God grant it;</HI> and may this Prince &s;urpa&s;s in glory and happine&s;s the wi&s;e Prince who was the fir&s;t that bore the Name. For <HI>Soleimaan</HI> &s;ignifies the &s;ame thing as <HI>Salomon;</HI> in the Hebrew; from whence it was que&s;tionle&s;s deriv'd. <HI>So|lem</HI> in that Language &s;ignifies peace, from whence the <HI>Arabs</HI> derive their <HI>Selim,</HI> which &s;ignifies <HI>Affable, Courteous, Peaceable;</HI> and perhaps the name of that famous Legi&s;lator among the <HI>Athenians, Solon,</HI> might have the &s;ame Etymology. And then the Hebrew <HI>Salomon,</HI> the Per&s;ian <HI>Soleimaan,</HI> the Turki&s;h and Arabian <HI>Setim,</HI> and the Grecian <HI>Solon</HI> will come to be one and the &s;ame Name.</P>
<P>The Doctor compos'd that Prayer with all the Eloquence he was Ma&s;ter of: which done, every one went to ki&s;s his Ma|je&s;ties feet, and then return'd to their places. Where all the Court &s;taid till it was Noon, and where they were &s;erv'd with a Collation of Sweet-meats, but no meat, by rea&s;on of the Kings &s;ickne&s;s. And by and by the Loud Mu&s;ick from the Royal Palace proclaim'd to the whole City the News of the Ceremo|ny. All the re&s;t of the day was &s;pent in Pa&s;times and publick Shews: and at night Lights were kept burning till Morning, and the Shops order'd to be kept open, for the People to walk the Streets as at Noon day.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time all the Seals and all the Money Stamps were broken, and others made with the new name of <HI>Soleimaan:</HI> and in the &s;pace of twenty four Hours &s;ome thou&s;ands of new Crowns were di&s;pers'd abroad. Moreover, to inform all the Provinces of this new Coronation, a Commi&s;&s;ion was given to <HI>Mahamed-Salek</HI> the Kings A&s;trologer, Brother to the Chief A&s;trologer, and Head of the Society, to write to all the Officers of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and all that had any Employment or Command in
<PB N="134" REF="288">
the Empire, and give 'em an account of the rea&s;on why his Maje&s;ty had chang'd his Name: That for the future they were to acknowledge King <HI>Soleimaan</HI> for Sovereign Monarch of <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> and that they were not any more to write to his Maje&s;ty but only by that Name; that in all their Provinces they were to era&s;e the Name of <HI>Sephie</HI> whereever they met with it, as an Ominous Name, that portended nothing but misfortune to the King and Kingdom. Nor was <HI>Mahamed-Saleh</HI> di&s;&s;atisfi'd in the lea&s;t with this Commi&s;&s;ion: For the Grandees and Officers, and in a word, all tho&s;e to whom he directed his Let|ters, were oblig'd to &s;end him &s;ome con&s;iderable Pre&s;ent, every one according to his Quality, for the <HI>Mou&s;htelog,</HI> or good News which they had receiv'd.</P>
<P>Royal Habits al&s;o were &s;ent pre&s;ently after the Coronation to the Governours, Lieutenants, and Collectors of the Publick Receipts, and all other Per&s;ons of Quality in all the &s;everal Provinces. With Patents and Commands in the Name of <HI>Soleimaan,</HI> as if a New King had a&s;cended the Throne: &s;o &s;trange|ly had a fooli&s;h and &s;uper&s;titious Fancy po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the mind of this Monarch and his Coun&s;ellours. Not but that 'tis very pro|bable they acted meerly out of Complai&s;ance. For they were too wi&s;e in my opinion, &s;eriou&s;ly to appear in an Action &s;o fan|ta&s;tick and extravagant, and which a man &s;hall hardly meet with the like in any other Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>However his Maje&s;ty, &s;o &s;oon as the Ceremony was over, fancy'd the recovery of his Health; and whether it were that Opinion contributed to his Imagination, certain it was that the Phy&s;ick which his Maje&s;ty took had &s;ome good Effect, and the King grew better; but the Kingdom had no advantage by it. On the contrary, the news of Wars arriv'd at <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> from all Parts, augmenting the Terrour, with which that dreadful Comet, that year appearing, had po&s;&s;e&s;s'd their Minds.</P>
<P>That great and remarkable Comet, which was &s;een almo&s;t over all the earth, appear'd al&s;o at that time in <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> The A&s;trologers call'd it <HI>Niazouk,</HI> or the <HI>Little Lance,</HI> as re&s;embling that Figure. For the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> do not give to Comets, as we do, the name which is common to tho&s;e Meteors, but according to the Figure which they repre&s;ent, as we have ob&s;erv'd in its pro|per place. They affirm'd they never &s;aw, not ever had heard &s;peak of any one that ever was like it. The Head of it was hid in the We&s;t, in &s;uch a manner, that nothing of it could be perceiv'd in that Horizon. In our Treati&s;e of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI>
<PB N="135" REF="288">
A&s;trology, we have given the de&s;cription of a Figure according to the ob&s;ervation made in the Capital City of the Province of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> the &s;eventh of <HI>March,</HI> which was the &s;econd day of its appearance. But we have not any where mention'd the Ob|&s;ervation that was made of it at <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> for which rea&s;on I thought it would be &s;omething to the purpo&s;e to &s;peak of it in this place.</P>
<P>The Ob&s;ervation then that was made of it in the Capital City of the Kingdom by the <HI>Mun&s;hiziims</HI> or Kings A&s;trologers, the tenth of <HI>May,</HI> at &s;even of the Clock in the Evening was this. It appear'd in the Southern part, and follow'd the motion of the <HI>Primum Mobile,</HI> it extended in length 30 <HI>deg.</HI> 32. <HI>min.</HI> and almo&s;t of an equal breadth of 6 <HI>deg.</HI> The colour of it was inclining &s;omewhat to yellow. The upper part of it advanc'd toward the Girdle of <HI>Orion,</HI> and the River <HI>Eridanus;</HI> in length from the <HI>Ram</HI> 72 <HI>deg.</HI> And its lower Extremity under the Whale, or the <HI>winding</HI> of <HI>Eridanus,</HI> where it extended in length 41 <HI>deg.</HI> 30 <HI>min.</HI> and in breadth 6 <HI>deg.</HI></P>
<P>All the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> A&s;trologers declar'd in their <HI>Takuims</HI> or Alma|nacks, which are properly the <HI>Ephemerides</HI> of the pre&s;ent Year, &s;peaking of this Meteor, that it &s;ignifi'd nothing but Wars, Murders, Seditions, Conflagrations, dangerous Di&s;ea&s;es, over|turning of Kingdoms and States, and, in a word, all manner of Calamities. But they fix'd all the&s;e dreadful Effects far off from <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> upon the <HI>Sunnis</HI> or <HI>Turks;</HI> and <HI>Kafers,</HI> which is a name that they give to Idolaters, among whom, according to their belief, they e&s;teem us Chri&s;tians to be the chief. But Time, who is the Ma&s;ter A&s;trologer, has made it appear to the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> that the&s;e &s;courges were as well prepar'd for them|&s;elves: For what has happen'd this year in that Kingdom has given 'em to under&s;tand that they are the Per&s;ons that mu&s;t be &s;mitten with this <HI>Cudgel:</HI> and that the <HI>Little Lance</HI> (for both the&s;e names they gave that Comet) will as &s;everely gore their &s;ides, and that a good &s;hare of &s;o many &s;ad Influences will fall upon the Dominions of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Empire, as well as in other places. The Governour of <HI>Kandaar</HI> was one of the fir&s;t who felt the fatal Influences of this Comet by his fall and death, which happen'd at the &s;ame time upon this occa&s;ion. For the better under&s;tanding of which we mu&s;t go back to the Story of his Life, where we left off, to bring him in a few words to his End.</P>
<P>We left him going to <HI>Kandaar</HI> with his Recruits; where &s;o &s;oon as he arriv'd, he found no likelihood of any War. Nor
<PB N="136" REF="289">
indeed did he expect any &s;uch thing: only he him&s;elf had caus'd the Rumour to be &s;pread abroad to obtain the Govern|ment; and to di&s;incumber him&s;elf from tho&s;e Troubles which his turbulent and wicked Conduct had drawn upon him&s;elf. But no &s;ooner was he arriv'd in that City but he began to appear in his own Colours, not &s;o much by &s;ecret contrivance, but openly and with a lofty pride acting a Petty Sovereign, and a&s;&s;uming ab&s;olute Dominion, taking away by force Virgins from their Parents, Married women from their Husbands to repleni&s;h his Palace; ob&s;erving no mea&s;ure, but u&s;ing as his Slaves and Footmen the <HI>Sultoons,</HI> or inferiour Governours, the <HI>Royal Farmers,</HI> and meaner Officers, pillaging and plundering where ever there was any thing to be got. In a word, his Tyranny grew to that extremity, that in all that &s;pacious Pro|vince there was not any body that was not in an extraordinary Con&s;ternation: for without any form of Proceeding, he put to death whomever he thought good, according as his fury or his intere&s;t in&s;pir'd him. Of the&s;e things Complaints were &s;ent to the Court, and the Cries of that infinite number which he had render'd mi&s;erable were &s;o loud, that they reach'd the Kings Ears. Which the Governours Enemies had &s;o much the fairer opportunity to improve, con&s;idering how the Clamours again&s;t his exorbitances dayly increas'd. Thereupon his Kin|dred and tho&s;e few friends he had left at Court &s;ent him word, that his Affairs were but in a bad condition, his proceedings being highly re&s;ented by his Maje&s;ty, and that unle&s;s he look'd carefully to him&s;elf, &s;ome mi&s;chievous Back&s;troke of Fortune threaten'd him. But he took little notice of this good advice; believing him&s;elf &s;o well a&s;&s;ur'd of his Princes favour; and therefore thinking him&s;elf proof again&s;t all the mo&s;t Potent Ac|cu&s;ations, he never alter'd his Conduct, but rather grew more haughty and di&s;orderly.</P>
<P>The <HI>Kaan</HI> Governor who had been di&s;plac'd to make way for him, was then at Court; however by the means of his friends he fail'd not to have a &s;trict eye upon all his Actions; nor were they le&s;s diligent to conveigh the complaints of the afflicted to the Kings Ear. So that at length all his Crimes were heap'd together; but while the King was wavering, whether to di&s;|grace him and ca&s;t him from his favour or not, he committed a new Act of Violence, which added a mo&s;t terrible weight to the foregoing Accu&s;ations.</P>
<P>Between the Kingdom of <HI>Kackmir,</HI> and the Province of <HI>Kan|daar,</HI> lie a certain People call'd <HI>Bolluki,</HI> who extend them&s;elves
<PB N="137" REF="289">
into <HI>India</HI> on that &s;ide; which Country is Govern'd by their own Native Princes; only tho&s;e that are next neighbours to <HI>Per|&s;ia,</HI> acknowledge the King and are his Tributaries. One of tho&s;e Princes had a very lovely Daughter of whom the Governor of <HI>Kandaar</HI> had heard a great Report, and therefore pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ired her for one of his Wives. To which purpo&s;e he &s;ends to demand her of the Prince her Father; who refus'd his Motion: The inamour'd Governor, not &s;o di&s;courag'd, &s;ent again, and receives a &s;econd denial, he &s;ends neverthele&s;s a third time, but to as little purpo&s;e, for that the <HI>Bolluki</HI> never intermix alliances but one with another. Upon this the Governor di&s;&s;em|bling his Indignation, always profe&s;s'd a great friend&s;hip for him, and invited him one day to a &s;umptuous Fea&s;t at <HI>Kandaar.</HI> The Prince mi&s;tru&s;ting nothing came to the Entertainment; but when the Governor had him in his Clutches, he caus'd his head to be cut off. Upon which, the Prince's Attendants when they under|&s;tood of his Death, di&s;daining &s;o foul a piece of Villany, all en|rag'd fell upon the Governors Guard, between whom and the Strangers there happend a bloody Combat, wherein three hun|dred <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> were &s;lain upon the place, and between &s;even and eight hundred of the others.</P>
<P>This made &s;uch a noi&s;e that the King began to &s;hew him&s;elf highly offended. Nor would the Governors Enemies omit &s;o fair an opportunity; believing now his Maje&s;ty would &s;uffer 'em to &s;ay any thing again&s;t a man that gave him &s;o much occa&s;ion of inward di&s;turbance, &s;o that they ea&s;ily per&s;waded him to revoke the permi&s;&s;ion he had given him to come to Court when he plea&s;ed him&s;elf. The pretence of which Revocation was grounded upon this, that it was a thing which had never been accu&s;tomed to be done, and which might in the end pro|duce dangerous Con&s;equences: and they thought they had gone a great way in gaining that point. For they were afraid, le&s;t if the Governor had free acce&s;s to Court he &s;hould regain by his Pre&s;ence, the Kings Favour; which &s;eem'd no difficult thing for him to do, who had the art &s;o well to counterfeit his pa&s;&s;ionate affection for the Kings Intere&s;t: and for that the King when the Governor was ready to depart for <HI>Kandaar,</HI> had te&s;tify'd his Sorrow to part with him, at what time he thus expre&s;s'd him&s;elf: <HI>Tho thou go'&s;t to</HI> Kandaar, <HI>thou &s;halt be never a jot the le&s;s my Fa|vourite, and thou &s;halt return to my Court whenever thou think'&s;t it convenient.</HI> Which was the rea&s;on of his giving him Letters of Licence to come when he pleas'd to Court without expecting any new Orders.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="290">
The Governor receiv'd the revocation of that Favour, and at the &s;ame time other Letters from his Brother, and the re&s;t of his Friends, advi&s;ing him to be careful in his Conduct; that his Fortune totter'd, and was within a little of falling altogether; and that his Enemies had made great advantage of the opportu|nities he had given 'em.</P>
<P>Upon this News he took a cour&s;e which he thought &s;o much the more worthy of him&s;elf, by how much it appear'd to him to be equally prudent and daring; tho by the event it prov'd no le&s;s fatal than ra&s;h. He a&s;&s;ur'd him&s;elf that &s;o &s;oon as he &s;hould but &s;ee the King, he &s;hould &s;et all things right again: that he &s;hould regain his fir&s;t Favour, and &s;catter the Faction of his Enemies. And therefore without ever Petitioning for any new Order or ex|pecting any Command, nay, again&s;t the very Command which he had receiv'd expre&s;ly forbidding his coming to Court, he takes Hor&s;e, and in nine days arrives at <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;peed that was made in this Journey was di&s;cour&s;ed of at <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> as of a thing altogether extraordinary and which was never done before. For of the&s;e nine days one mu&s;t be de|ducted that he &s;taid to re&s;t him&s;elf in a Garden about a hundred and fifty Leagues from <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI> So that in &s;ome eight days he rode as much ground as u&s;ually takes up three Months ordinary Travelling from <HI>Kandaar</HI> to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> that is to &s;ay, three hun|dred and fifty <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Leagues, which are more then four hun|dred and fifty French Leagues.</P>
<P>However he did not enter the City, but went to a Garden near the <HI>Tok&s;hi</HI> which is one of the Gates of the City, from whence according to Cu&s;tom he &s;ent to give notice to the King, <HI>that the Governor of</HI> Kandaar <HI>his Slave, attended till his Maje&s;ty &s;hould grant him the favour to come and ki&s;s his feet.</HI> By which action he thought to have carry'd the day from his Enemies, and to have regain'd the Kings Affection.</P>
<P>The King was then in the Womens Palace, where the Eunuchs were charged to carry him the news. Which Charge the High Chamberlain and the Prince&s;&s;es High Steward (tho&s;e potent Eunuchs whom he had endeavor'd to &s;et together by the ears by his cunning contrivances of fal&s;e reports) undertook upon them|&s;elves, and taking their time to enjoy that revenge which they had prepar'd in their hearts, with an a&s;toni&s;hment in their faces, &s;o much the greater becau&s;e affected, they tell the King of the Gover|nors arrival, adding withal, <HI>That they could not tell how that Action of the Governor might be interpreted, but to come not only without permi&s;|&s;ion, but contrary to a po&s;itive inhibition to quit his new Government,</HI>
<PB N="139" REF="290">
<HI>could not but be a heinous contempt of his Maje&s;ty, and a manife&s;t Re|bellion; that &s;ince the fir&s;t foundation of the</HI> Per&s;ian <HI>Empire, never any Governor dur&s;t be &s;o bold as to quit his Government and come of his own head, and out of his own humour to the King.</HI> In a word they repre&s;ented this Order &s;o foul to the King, that he &s;ent to the Governor of <HI>Kandaar,</HI> to go and &s;urrender him&s;elf into the Cu|&s;tody of <HI>Ogourlon Kan</HI> Grand Porter; and to him he &s;ent orders to put him into the <HI>Krondou&s;hake,</HI> which is a little Woodden Engine that Pillories the neck, and fa&s;tens the right Arm of the Pri&s;oner to his Girdle, &s;o that he has no way to help him&s;elf with that hand, which is the way to &s;ecure the per&s;ons of Gran|dees that are look'd upon as Criminals.</P>
<P>Thus he remain'd three days in the Captain of the Royal Gate's Hou&s;e. All which time the poor Governor conjur'd Hea|ven and Earth; be&s;ought of God and Man that he might only be permitted to &s;ee the King; a&s;&s;uring him&s;elf that with one &s;ingle word he &s;hould be able to ruine tho&s;e that had determin'd his de&s;truction. But they who fear'd no le&s;s, and dreaded that permi&s;&s;ion, labour'd their utmo&s;t to prevent it, and &s;ought by all ways to exa&s;perate the Kings anger already kindl'd again&s;t him. For as the Governor thought it a knack of State to be permitted to &s;ee the King; &s;o on the other &s;ide, his Enemies deem'd it no le&s;s a piece of State-policy to prevent that honour from being granted him.</P>
<P>In the mean time the <HI>Chief Porter</HI> being gain'd by the Gover|nors moans and entreaties, the third day of his impri&s;onment carry'd him with the woodden Pillory to the great Portal of the Palace that looks towards the Royal Piazza, and there leaving him in the hands of his Servants, went to his Maje&s;ty and told him, <HI>That the Governor of</HI> Kandaar, <HI>had as it were forc'd him by his moans and intreaties to bring him to the Kings Gate: and that the poor Lord was there, waiting for the favour to be admitted to ki&s;s his Maje&s;ties feet.</HI> But then the Enemies of that unfortunate Lord, who were in no &s;mall number about the King, renew'd their Accu&s;ations, and took the more boldne&s;s, in regard the King was no way unwilling to hear their complaints. Every one aggrava|ted what he knew the Offender to have mo&s;t criminally com|mitted: But above all his Predece&s;&s;or in the Government of <HI>Kandaar,</HI> who the day before and that very day had caus'd above three hundred Petitions to be Pre&s;ented again&s;t him by &s;e|veral Per&s;ons of the &s;ame Province, that demanded Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Thus his Enemies became too powerful for him, &s;o that after an hours deliberation, the King commanded the <HI>Chief</HI>
<PB N="140" REF="291">
<HI>Porter</HI> to go and rip up his Guts. Pre&s;ently the <HI>Lord</HI> ha&s;ten'd to obey the King's Orders, and as far off as he could &s;ee the Gate he cries <HI>Vour,</HI> that is to &s;ay, <HI>&s;trike;</HI> which is the Signal of death. Immediately the next Officer that heard the word, gives him a kick with his Foot upon the Stomach, and threw him out of the Portal into the <HI>Royal Piazza.</HI> There with his Sword he gives him two great Ga&s;hes upon one &s;ide of his Neck: but in regard his head did not tumble as yet, another drew his Dagger, and &s;tabb'd him under the Ribs into the &s;mall Guts, and thus he expir'd weltring in his Blood, which &s;tream'd from him in a prodigious quantity, as being a very Sanguine Per&s;on.</P>
<P>Now in the mid&s;t of the Royal Piazza, over again&s;t the great Portal of the Palace is &s;et up a large May-pole of an extraordi|nary height, on the top of which upon &s;olemn Fe&s;tivals and days of publick rejoycing is fix'd a Cup of Gold, which is a Prize to be won by the fir&s;t among the Hor&s;emen that can &s;hoot it down with his Bow and Arrows upon a full Gallop: and upon the top of this Maypole it was, that the head of this great Per|&s;onage was &s;et up by the Kings order, the rea&s;on of which was, as the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> &s;aid that pa&s;s'd along, to the end his malicious Tongue might not be able at &s;o great a di&s;tance to &s;ow Di&s;cord and Di&s;&s;en&s;ion.</P>
<P>This was the end of <HI>Gem&s;hid-Kaan,</HI> who indeed did no way merit a better Fate: for there was not any body that piti'd his fall; or rather, there was not any body that did not load him with Cur&s;es: &s;o that his Body lay two days in the publick <HI>Piazza,</HI> be|fore his Maje&s;ty gave permi&s;&s;ion for its Interment.</P>
<P>He was of a goodly &s;tature and proportion; had a noble a&s;|pect, and the Port of a Per&s;on of Quality; his Countenance very plea&s;ing and winning at fir&s;t &s;ight; be&s;ides that a va&s;t Courage, and profu&s;e munificence accompany'd the&s;e outward Graces of the Body. But &s;etting a&s;ide the&s;e two Qualities of his Soul that were laudable, the re&s;t were all as venomous and tainted as the&s;e were Eminent.</P>
<P>Four days after this Execution, the Commi&s;&s;ion for Governor of <HI>Kandaar</HI> was &s;ent to <HI>Mahammed-Kouli-Kaan,</HI> that is to &s;ay, the <HI>Lord Slave of Mahamed.</HI> This Lord had been thirteen years a Pri|&s;oner, Bani&s;h'd to <HI>Casbin</HI> by <HI>Habas</HI> II. Of which this was the true Cau&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Habas</HI> II. being one day abroad with his Women, this Lord, before he was aware was got within the limits that are prohibi|ted to men; where the Guard of the <HI>Courouk</HI> perceiving him fell upon him, and Ba&s;tinado'd him mo&s;t &s;everely. Some days af|ter,
<PB N="141" REF="291">
&s;o &s;oon as he was able to go, he went to the Palace where the King was &s;itting in the publick A&s;&s;embly, where taking the King a&s;ide, with a re&s;olv'd Countenance, <HI>Did I not &s;ee thee,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>with this Heron Tuft upon thy Head, and ob&s;erve the great Honour which the Grandees pay thee, there is nothing that I &s;hould take thee for le&s;s than the King of</HI> Per&s;ia. <HI>By the name of God does it become thee to run a rambling over the&s;e Mountains with a Covey of Wo|men, and at the &s;ame time cau&s;e the Lords of thy Kingdom to have their bones broken with ignominious Ba&s;tinadoes?</HI></P>
<P>The King heard this Reprimand without &s;eeming to be any way di&s;turb'd; only in a carele&s;s manner order'd an addition of Ba&s;tinadoes to be given him be&s;ides tho&s;e of which he already complain'd. Upon which, Generous and Couragious as he was, lo&s;ing all manner of Patience, he draws his Sword, and throwing him&s;elf at the Kings feet, <Q><HI>Let 'em,</HI> &s;aid he, Ba&s;tinado me again, here is my Sword to puni&s;h my &s;elf; your Maje&s;ty may do with me what you plea&s;e, and put me to what Torments you think fit, but if a Per&s;on of my Quality mu&s;t be &s;ubject to Ba&s;tina|does, what mu&s;t a poor <HI>Ke&s;t-Ba&s;h</HI> expect (for &s;o they call the Souldiers that compo&s;e the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Militia.)</Q> The Monarch plea|&s;ed with this generous Repartee, would neither Sentence him to Death as he de&s;erv'd by the Laws of the Kingdom, nor to the Cudgel; but only Bani&s;h'd him to <HI>Casbin.</HI></P>
<P>But he was joyfully &s;urpris'd when he receiv'd the Patent for a Government, which not only re&s;tor'd him to his Liberty, but at the &s;ame time conferr'd upon him one of the mo&s;t important employments in the Kingdom. I confe&s;s I know not what may be thought of &s;uch Politicks as the&s;e, as hunt in Jails for men of Merit, to advance the di&s;oblig'd by long Impri&s;onment to the mo&s;t con&s;iderable places of Tru&s;t in the Kingdom, and to com|mit to his care a Province and &s;trong Hold which on that &s;ide the Country may be &s;aid to be the Key of the Kingdom. Of nece&s;&s;ity the King mu&s;t be &s;trangely a&s;&s;ur'd of the fidelity of his Subjects. For there is no que&s;tion to be made, but that if a Governor of <HI>Kandaar</HI> will call in the <HI>Indian,</HI> and &s;ell him that Place, but that he may have &s;everal Millions of Money for his Service, and have what advancement he plea&s;es him&s;elf in that Empire, as is apparent by one Example in the time of <HI>Sephi</HI> I.</P>
<P>During the&s;e Revolutions in the Court of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> four Com|mi&s;&s;ioners arriv'd from the <HI>Mu&s;covite Co&s;aques,</HI> who but two Months before had made a mo&s;t furious Inrode into <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> on that &s;ide where <HI>Hyrcania</HI> lies, upon the Shore of the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea. But be|fore
<PB N="142" REF="292">
we &s;peak of the Inva&s;ion it will be nece&s;&s;ary to tell the Rea|&s;on.</P>
<P>In the year 1664. according to our account there arriv'd at <HI>I&s;|pahan</HI> a famous Emba&s;&s;ie from <HI>Mu&s;covie,</HI> wherein two Emba&s;&s;a|dors were concern'd, with a Train of about eight hundred Men: and the Pre&s;ents which they made the King were valu'd by ap|prai&s;ment at five thou&s;and <HI>Tomans</HI> or &s;eventeen thou&s;and five hun|dred pounds Sterling.</P>
<P>They con&s;i&s;ted of two Coaches enrich'd with mo&s;t &s;umptu|ous Embroideries, <HI>Flanders</HI> Hor&s;es, and Bea&s;ts of their own Country, as black Foxes, white Bears and Doynes. But the chiefe&s;t wealth of the Pre&s;ent lay in the prodigious quantity of Sables which the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> call <HI>Samur.</HI> The&s;e Emba&s;&s;adors as it was believ'd came only to Traffick, and to have permi&s;&s;ion by vertue of their Title of Emba&s;&s;adors to import and export what Goods they pleas'd without paying Cu&s;tom. And indeed 'twas thought that they &s;old in Sables only at <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> as many as came to 280000 <HI>l. Ster.</HI> by which you may judge of the re&s;t. Neverthe|le&s;s the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> entertain'd 'em very civilly at fir&s;t, and allow'd 'em their expences which was tax'd at ten <HI>Tomans</HI> or 35 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling <HI>per</HI> day, which they rather cho&s;e to take in Money than in Victuals, to the end they might lay up the be&s;t part. To which purpo&s;e they liv'd mo&s;t wretchedly, and in the Magnifi|cent Palace which the King had a&s;&s;ign'd 'em they laid their tails among the Co&s;tly Moveables wherewith it was furni&s;h'd, like &s;o many Dogs. For which rea&s;on the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> look'd upon the <HI>Mo&s;covites</HI> as the mo&s;t paltry narrow-&s;oul'd, and infamous among all the Chri&s;tians; and in deri&s;ion call 'em the <HI>Yusbeks</HI> of <HI>Europe,</HI> thereby expre&s;&s;ing the &s;mall e&s;teem they have of 'em; for the <HI>Yus|beks</HI> are the mo&s;t abject People of all the <HI>Ea&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The King therefore di&s;daining the Infamy of the&s;e Amba&s;&s;a|dors, and &s;eeing that indeed they were &s;ent by their Ma&s;ter for no other rea&s;on then to Traffick, to &s;ell their Furs and other Com|modities, and to carry away Stuffs, Leather, and other &s;uch like Merchandizes out of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> but e&s;pecially Mony, abus'd 'em at length and made little account of 'em. One of 'em dy'd, and the other return'd home with his tatter'd Train without any ho|nour &s;hewn him, or hardly any an&s;wer given him.</P>
<P>The Grand <HI>Duke</HI> highly re&s;ented this Affront, but di&s;&s;embl'd his Choler for the pre&s;ent, in regard he dur&s;t not meddle with <HI>Habas:</HI> but under&s;tanding at the beginning of the Year 1665. that he was dead, and that the Scepter of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> was fall'n into the Hands of a Young Prince, he re&s;olv'd to take his revenge, tho he were
<PB N="143" REF="292">
unwilling to enter into open and declar'd Ho&s;tility; and there|fore that he might &s;trike and not be &s;een, he incites and encou|rages the <HI>Co&s;&s;acks</HI> next adjoyning to the black Sea; orders 'em to march along the Lake <HI>Moeotis,</HI> and &s;o to fall into <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> upon <HI>Hir|cania</HI> &s;ide, with this Caution that they &s;hould take care how they mention'd him, or acknowledg'd that they had any Corre&s;pon|dence with him, but only that they had undertaken the Enter|prize upon their own Heads: which is no more than what was reported and believ'd at the Court of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Co&s;&s;acks</HI> were ea&s;ily per&s;uaded, and therefore embarking to the number of &s;ix thou&s;and in forty large Barques, &s;uch as u&s;e the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea (which are long and broad Ve&s;&s;els, but &s;hal|low built to avoid the Rocks that lie two or three foot under water) and in each Barque carrying two Pieces of <HI>Cannon,</HI> they ca&s;t Anchor fir&s;t near <HI>Ereck,</HI> a &s;mall City upon the Borders of <HI>Guilan</HI> or <HI>Hircania,</HI> where they landed to the number of four thou&s;and, and finding the Place without Soldiers, and the In|habitants no way prepar'd for defence, they pillage and plun|der it, and after a great &s;laughter of both Sexes retreat in great ha&s;t with all their Booty to their Ve&s;&s;els, that lay out at Sea as far as they could for fear of being di&s;cover'd.</P>
<P>Moreover, for the more crafty management of their Game they &s;ent four of their chief Heads, in the Nature of Emba&s;&s;a|dours with Letters of Credence to the Court, and the Governour of <HI>Shamaky</HI> order'd his People to convey 'em to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> where they arriv'd &s;oon after the news of their Irruption. They were civilly entertain'd, a Lodging was a&s;&s;ign'd 'em, and their Expences defray'd as is u&s;ual for other Emba&s;&s;adours. Soon after they demanded Audience of the King, but that was deni'd 'em, becau&s;e they were not of &s;ufficient Quality to claim that Honour. However it was concluded that the Prime Mini&s;ter &s;hould grant 'em Audience, which they accepted. There they &s;et forth, <Q>That they were Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;ent by &s;ix thou&s;and of the <HI>Co&s;&s;acks,</HI> that lay at Anchor in the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea; that in truth they were formerly &s;ubject to the Empire of the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> but that being wea|ried by the oppre&s;&s;ion which they endur'd there, they had re&s;olv'd to fly their Country with their Wives and Children: and whatever el&s;e of their Goods they could carry along with 'em. That after they had debated whither to fly for &s;afety and protection, <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> was the Place that they had pitch'd upon, as being a Monarchy that lov'd Ju&s;tice, and was kind to her Slaves. For which rea&s;on they had concluded to offer their &s;ervice to his Maje&s;ty, and therefore they were departed
<PB N="144" REF="293">
from <HI>Sha-Seven,</HI> for love of the King, and now they hop'd from the Genero&s;ity of &s;o great a Monarch, that he would li&s;ten to their Petitions, afford 'em a Sanctuary, and a&s;&s;ign 'em Lands for their Habitation.</Q></P>
<P>This &s;aid, they pre&s;ented their Letters of Credence; which the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> could never uncypher, tho they made u&s;e of all the mo&s;t cunning and learned Interpreters as well of their own Nation, as of <HI>Europeans,</HI> that were found at <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI></P>
<P>The Chief Mini&s;ter thus di&s;appointed, made his la&s;t trial upon a Capuchin, who for twenty years together had been &s;till employ'd by the Mini&s;ters of State of that Kingdom. It happen'd al&s;o when the Paper was brought him, that the Sieur <HI>Herbert d'Jager</HI> was with him; a Chief of the Dutch Factory at <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI> He was a per&s;on that for the under&s;tanding of Lan|guages had few that might compare with him: for be&s;ides that he perfectly under&s;tood all that are at pre&s;ent &s;poken in the <HI>Ea&s;t;</HI> he is al&s;o well skill'd in the Ancient and Vulgar Greek, the Syriac, and the Hebrew.</P>
<P>They could hardly have met with per&s;ons more able to have di&s;&s;ipated the&s;e Clouds; neverthele&s;s they could do nothing; They were Greek Letters, they &s;aid, for the mo&s;t part inter|mix'd with other unknown Characters, of which &s;ome were &s;omewhat like the <HI>Syriac:</HI> They read &s;ome words here and there, but in regard they could find no Connexion of &s;en&s;e, they dur&s;t not be certain whether they read right or no. So that they were con&s;train'd to &s;end the Writing back to the fir&s;t Mini&s;ter; the Superiour of the Capuchins giving him this far|ther account by the Me&s;&s;enger, that it was a half <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian,</HI> half <HI>Ca&s;aque</HI> writing, that he could not uncypher.</P>
<P>They were therefore forc'd to give credit to what the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners had told 'em by word of mouth; which was always the &s;ame thing that they had &s;aid at fir&s;t. To which the Prime Mini&s;ter an&s;wered: <Q>If what you a&s;&s;ure us be true, that you are come to be our Gue&s;ts, and to &s;urrender your &s;elves Slaves to his Maje&s;ty, wherefore do you enter <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> with your Swords in your hands? Why have you ma&s;&s;acr'd our Subjects, laid wa&s;t our Cities, and pillag'd our Territories?</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Co&s;aques</HI> repli'd in ju&s;tification of them&s;elves that they had been forc'd to do it; for that when they came civilly to de&s;ire provi&s;ion for their money, the People of the City forget|ful of the Laws of Ho&s;pitality, and that Commi&s;eration which is due to &s;trangers, fell upon 'em, and mi&s;us'd 'em; and there|fore the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;elf-defence ought to ju&s;tifie the <HI>Co&s;acques</HI> for
<PB N="145" REF="293">
endeavouring to obtain that by force, which they could not get by fair means.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time that they were thus treating with the&s;e Commi&s;&s;ioners, arriv'd an Envoy from <HI>Orous,</HI> that is to &s;ay, the great Duke of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> (which name I think the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> give him, becau&s;e that <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> makes a part of his Dominions) which Envoy pre&s;ented Letters from the grand Duke to the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> to this Effect, <Q>That whereas he under&s;tood that a certain number of <HI>Co&s;aques</HI> being his Subjects, had quitted their Habitations, on purpo&s;e to withdraw them|&s;elves from his Obedience, and &s;ought for Protection in <HI>Per|&s;ia,</HI> he de&s;ir'd his Maje&s;ty not to receive 'em, nor to give any credit to their Propo&s;itions; That they were Rebels and Fu|gitives who would never be true to any other, &s;ince they had been fal&s;e to their Prince; and that he was ordering Forces to reduce 'em to their former Obedience.</Q></P>
<P>But if the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Prince advis'd the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> not to believe the <HI>Co&s;aques,</HI> they were &s;ufficiently a&s;&s;ur'd, that they were not to give credit to him; for that the Court were all along of Opi|nion that he held a corre&s;pondence with tho&s;e Boot-halers the <HI>Co&s;aques.</HI> And the rea&s;on upon which they grounded their be|lief was probable enough. For how is it po&s;&s;ible el&s;e &s;aid the Politicians, that five or &s;ix thou&s;and Fugitives &s;hould come into a Country, with forty Barks, and four and twenty Pieces of Artillery, provided with all &s;orts of Ammunition and Pro|vi&s;ion? Is it not ea&s;ie to &s;ee that it is the Grand Duke that &s;ends 'em, to revenge the Affronts, which he is made believe his Emba&s;&s;adours receiv'd?</P>
<P>And as the Grand Duke of <HI>Mu&s;covie's</HI> Agent could not infu&s;e a good opinion of his Ma&s;ter into the Court of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> &s;o nei|ther could the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of <HI>Bazra</HI>'s Envoy prevail in behalf of his. It has been &s;aid, how that <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> had made an Accommodation with the General of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Army the la&s;t year, and that he had &s;ent his Son-in-law to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> for a Ratification of the Agreement. But when he came there, the Mini&s;ters of the Port made him An&s;wer, that the General of the Army had treated with the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> without their Order, and that they would by no means hear of that Agreement, for that the Place mu&s;t ab&s;o|lutely be &s;urrender'd into the Grand Signior's hands. Where|upon they offer'd the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI>'s Son-in-law, that if he would contribute to the reducing that place, he &s;hould be made Go|verour or <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of the Territory; and manag'd him &s;o well, that at la&s;t he con&s;ented, and promis'd to make 'em Ma&s;ters of
<PB N="146" REF="294">
it. After this, the Mini&s;ters di&s;patch to the &s;ame Generals new Orders to return with their Forces to the Siege of <HI>Ba&s;ra;</HI> &s;harply rebuke the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of <HI>Babylon</HI> for having been &s;o remi&s;s in that Affair; That the pretended agreement was to the prejudice and di&s;honour of the Empire; that he &s;hould repair the fault he had commited; and that they would make him General a &s;e|cond time, provided he would take the City by force, or con|&s;train it to a &s;urrender, and that when he had reduc'd it, he &s;hould con&s;titute for Governour <HI>Hiatria Ba&s;ha,</HI> the Son-in-law of the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of <HI>Ba&s;ra</HI> him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of <HI>Ba&s;ra,</HI> when he heard the&s;e Tidings was &s;trangely &s;urpriz'd at the Treachery of his Son-in-law, and &s;et him&s;elf to con&s;ider which way to divert his terrible &s;torm that threaten'd him. And therefore perceiving in the Spring, that the Turki&s;h Armies were preparing to thunder in upon him the next <HI>September</HI> or <HI>October</HI> (for the heat of tho&s;e Climates will not permit 'em to take the Field &s;ooner) he &s;ent beforehand to offer his Territory to the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> upon &s;uch condi|tion as he pleas'd him&s;elf, provided he might have the Com|mand of it during his own Life. The Council of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> knew the Importance of that place; they &s;aw how prejudicial it would be to <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> if it &s;hould fall into the hands of the Turks, and how advantageous it would be to them&s;elves to be Ma&s;ters of it. So that at another time, and under another Prince, they would willingly have embrac'd &s;uch a Propo&s;al; but they were afraid to provoke that Bugbear of the Univer&s;e, that Pannic Terrour of the Earth, con&s;idering the weak E&s;tate of the Empire under a Prince effeminated by Plea&s;ures, and who&s;e Age as well as his Humour render'd him uncapable to under|take great Actions. Therefore they gave no Po&s;itive An&s;wer to the Envoy from <HI>Ba&s;ra,</HI> but put him off from day to day, and a&s;&s;ur'd him they would take him into their Con&s;ideration, and all to gain time, for they were unwilling to &s;ay we dare not, nor we cannot do it.</P>
<P>While the&s;e things were tran&s;acted in Council, they were con&s;ulting at Court the recalling of <HI>Boudak Sultaan</HI> General of the Mu&s;quetteers. For this &s;ame Lord as well as the re&s;t whom we have di&s;cours'd of, in the time of his being a Favourite had abus'd his Power, by which means he had rais'd him&s;elf many ene|mies, who&s;e number daily increas'd. At fir&s;t they began to frame Complaints again&s;t him, &s;o that his Authority began to le&s;&s;en by degrees, and his Prince's affection began to wax cold. Which made him fear the &s;ame ill fortune as had befaln <HI>Gem&s;hid Kaan,</HI>
<PB N="147" REF="294">
Governor of <HI>Kandaar,</HI> and therefore he would not carry things with a high hand, as that Grandee had done, but before the Mi|&s;chief was pa&s;t cure, he began to think which way he might retire &s;ilently and without any notice taken, to di&s;charge him&s;elf of that Envy, which the lu&s;tre of his good Fortune had brought upon him.</P>
<P>The principal occa&s;ion of his lo&s;ing his Ma&s;ters Favour was this. To the Ea&s;t of <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> and near adjoyning to his Terri|tory lyes the Province of <HI>Lour-E&s;tom,</HI> which is held to be a part of ancient <HI>Parthia,</HI> extending on <HI>Arabia</HI>'s &s;ide toward <HI>Ba&s;ra.</HI> The People that Inhabit it, never mind the building of Cities, nor have any &s;ettl'd Abodes, but live in Tents, for the mo&s;t part feed|ing their Flocks and their Heards, of which they have an infi|nite number. They are Govern'd by a <HI>Kaan</HI> who is &s;et over 'em by the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> but cho&s;en from among them&s;elves: and for the mo&s;t part all of the &s;ame Race, the Father Succeed|ing the Son. So that there &s;till remains among them &s;ome &s;ha|dow of Liberty; however they pay both Tribute and Tenths. This Province furni&s;hes <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> and the Neighbouring parts with Car|tel; which is the rea&s;on that the Governor of the&s;e People is greatly re&s;pected in tho&s;e parts. <HI>Soleiman</HI> the third therefore at his coming to the Crown, commanded the General of the Mu&s;|quetteers to &s;end Royal Habits and Gommi&s;&s;ions unto all the Grandees. But the General of the Mu&s;quetteers having had &s;ome quarrel with this Governor who is call'd <HI>Lour-Manou&s;har Kaan,</HI> neglected to do him that Honour, putting off his &s;ending the Kings Pre&s;ent to him till &s;ix Months after. The <HI>Grandee</HI> impatiently brook'd the contempt; and being &s;ufficiently convinc'd who was the occa&s;ion of it, for mad|ne&s;s he tore in pieces the Habit which was pre&s;ented him, &s;aying withal, I value not the Habits, nor the Commi&s;&s;ions which the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI>'s General of the Mu&s;quetteers &s;ends me.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty knew nothing of this for a good while; the thing was conceal'd from him, for fear at the &s;ame time he &s;hould have inform'd him&s;elf of the Cau&s;e. But the Prince him&s;elf inform'd the King; for &s;ome time after he de&s;ir'd leave to come to Court and ki&s;s the Kings feet; which was granted him: He paid his Homage to his Maje&s;ty, deliver'd him his Pre&s;ent which was very Magnificent, and afterwards made his Complement that the General of the Mu&s;quetteers having by his order &s;ent Royal Habits to all the Grandees of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> even to the meane&s;t Officer, had omitted the &s;ending to him for &s;even or eight Months, and after all had &s;ent only by one of his Servants.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="295">
The King took it very ill, and declar'd to the General of the Mu&s;quetteers, that his manner of proceeding did not plea&s;e him. However his Maje&s;ty would not ruine him altogether, having an e&s;teem for him as being the Per&s;on that had plac'd him upon the Throne. And therefore he &s;par'd him, as his Predece&s;&s;ors had always done, in being gentle to tho&s;e who brought 'em the fir&s;t tydings of their advancement; for they never put 'em to death, as being &s;atisfi'd with their di&s;grace and misfortune.</P>
<P>The General of the mu&s;quetteers was then at Court in this Condition of his Affairs; but he could not continue long in that po&s;ture; when the death of one of his Relations, or at lea&s;t of one whom he &s;o call'd gave him a fair opportunity to retire with Credit. This pretended kind&s;man of his was call'd <HI>Abdal Bek</HI> Chief Porter of the <HI>Haram</HI> or Palace of Women. The Gene|ral therefore as &s;oon as he heard of his death, pre&s;ented a Petiti|on to the King, wherein he &s;et forth, that <HI>Abdal-Beck</HI> was his kin&s;man, that the Imployment which he had executed had con|tinu'd in their Family from time to time, as it were hereditary. Wherefore in con&s;ideration that the deceas'd Officer had left no Sons to &s;erve his Maje&s;ty in &s;uch a particular and ordinary Em|ployment, he was willing to lay down his Commi&s;&s;ion of Ge|neral of the Mu&s;quetteers, and his Right of &s;itting before his Maje&s;ty in publick A&s;&s;emblies, and that he &s;hould think him|&s;elf more happy to be employ'd in keeping the Gate of his Ma|je&s;ties Palace for the Women. The King, who for the rea&s;ons already alledg'd &s;till pre&s;erv'd &s;ome kind of Affection for him, granted his Reque&s;t. And it was then that he had conferr'd upon him the favour of keeping the Womens Palace-Gate, to &s;helter him from the Tempe&s;t that threatned him; and thus he deliver'd him&s;elf from the Intrigues of the Court.</P>
<P>This was he whom <HI>Habas</HI> II. had &s;ent Emba&s;&s;ador to <HI>Au|reng Zeb,</HI> King of the <HI>Indies,</HI> after he came to be in quiet Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Empire.

He is a Per&s;on of Courage, and an excellent Cap|tain, one of tho&s;e old Heroes that rendred the Reign of <HI>Habas</HI>

the Great &s;o Glorious and Triumphant. His Government of <HI>Chaldea</HI> was at the &s;ame time conferr'd upon one of his Sons <HI>So|leimaan Kan,</HI> who is a Noble-man of Merit and Courage, and worthy &s;uch an Illu&s;trious Father.</P>
<P>The Lightning of Royal disfavour fell afterwards upon <HI>Mir|za-Sadec,</HI> which name of <HI>Sadek</HI> in the Oriental Languages &s;ig|nifies <HI>Ju&s;t,</HI> and is the &s;ame with <HI>Sadoc</HI> among the <HI>Hebrews.</HI> He was Brother to <HI>Mirza-Ibraim</HI> already mention'd, and wor&s;e then he; <HI>Vazier</HI> or Farmer-Royal of <HI>Fars</HI> or the ancient <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> The Com|plaints of <HI>Shiras</HI> at length threw him out of this Employment. The People had for &s;everal years with hearty prayers to Heaven implor'd his Ruin, but could never obtain it: they clamour'd again&s;t his Robberies and Violences; whole crouds of Petitioners throng'd to Court with complaints again&s;t him; but his Pre&s;ents and his &s;pecious Letters fru&s;trated all their Attempts. Nay, one of the principal Occa&s;ions of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Emba&s;&s;ie in the year 1666. was to complain of his Vexations, and the &s;top which he gave to their Trade. All the World thought that &s;uch a blow as that would have fetch'd his Head from his Shoulders; but he fended it off by the help of a Si&s;ter which he had in the Womens Palace. So that he was di&s;charg'd with only a &s;evere Repri|mand which was &s;ent him in a Patent of which the Dutch them|&s;elves were the Me&s;&s;engers. At length this very year &s;o many fre&s;h complaints came again&s;t him, that he could find no more Eva&s;ions, neither would his pretences avail any longer, though he ply'd the Court &s;till to the value of about thirty thou&s;and pound; which they took, but &s;par'd him never a whit the more. He was expell'd from his Employment and all his Goods Con|fi&s;cated. It was believ'd at Court that his E&s;tate would have amounted to &s;everal hundred thou&s;and pounds, but they were amaz'd when they found that the Account ro&s;e to no more then 80200 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling in Gold and Silver, which he had at home in his Coffers, &s;ix thou&s;and four hundred pound in Goods, Movea|bles, Hor&s;es, Stuffs, Merchandize, and &s;uch other like Furniture which was not for ordinary u&s;e. In his Trea&s;urers Coffers was found &s;even thou&s;and pound in Silver Money, and eight hun|dred &s;eventy five pound in Duckats of Gold.</P>
<P>This crafty Lord long fore&s;aw what then befel him; and therefore he had convey'd away his Jewels, and what he had of mo&s;t co&s;tly value, and the greate&s;t part of his ready Money; and had only left tho&s;e Sums at home to dazle the Eye, and make the Court believe it was his whole E&s;tate. But no body could imagine it, and his Maje&s;ty &s;ent into all Places belong|ing
<PB N="150" REF="296">
to his Juri&s;diction an expre&s;s Order to make diligent &s;earch for all Goods and Money, or whatever el&s;e might be thought to belong to the Offender, and put forth a Proclamation for all to di&s;cover what they knew. The &s;ame was done at <HI>I&s;pahan:</HI> but notwith&s;tanding all that extraordinary diligence there was no more di&s;cover'd then about &s;ixty thou&s;and Crowns; be&s;ides Goods that were not moveable. The King left him all the Furniture of his Palace: nor did he meddle with his Ward|robe, nor with any thing that belong'd to his Women, nor with any thing that was for common u&s;e in his Offices and Stables. Be&s;ide, he gave him liberty to enjoy a yearly Revenue of four thou&s;and pound Sterling to maintain him &s;hut up in a Palace a little way di&s;tant from <HI>Shiras;</HI> whence he was not to &s;tir him&s;elf; but might receive the Vi&s;its of his Friends. His Children al&s;o were at the &s;ame time put out of Favour, and lo&s;t their Employments.</P>
<P>After his Fall the King would not confer his Place upon any Lord, as being one of the mo&s;t gainful Employments in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> but &s;ent to a certain <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Lord of an ancient Family, who re&s;ided at <HI>Shiras,</HI> who&s;e name was <HI>Sefie-Kouli-Sultaan</HI> a &s;hort Commi&s;&s;ion, under the Title of <HI>Governor pro tempore of the Pro|vince,</HI> till he &s;hould think fit to &s;upply the Place other ways.</P>
<P>We have told ye how the greate&s;t part of tho&s;e that fell into di&s;grace in the Reign of <HI>Habas</HI> II. return'd from their Exile, and were re&s;tor'd to favor, at the beginning of the new Reign. In the number of the&s;e was <HI>Mirza Hadi</HI> one of the mo&s;t Learned Lords of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> able to in&s;truct whoever would be de&s;irous to know whatever is of choice&s;t Secrecy in that Empire, whether as to the Situation of Places, as to Hi&s;tory or Politicks: and therefore it was that I endeavour'd to benefit by his friend&s;hip and di&s;cour&s;e. The Chief Mini&s;ter to the deceas'd King made out the Proce&s;s again&s;t him, and had confin'd him to his Palace in <HI>I&s;pahan;</HI> whence he never &s;tirr'd, till after the death of that Monarch. And in re|gard he often frequented the Court, and was in great Reputa|tion there, he was advanc'd to the Employment of Farmer-Roy|al of <HI>Kirmaan</HI> or <HI>Caramania.</HI></P>
<P>There was al&s;o living in <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> &s;ome three years &s;ince, an ancient <HI>Indian</HI> Prince&s;s, who was there detain'd a Pri&s;oner. She was Si&s;ter to the la&s;t King of <HI>Decan,</HI> and was call'd by the name of <HI>Saheb-Koud-&s;hek,</HI> that is to &s;ay in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> of the <HI>Indies,</HI> the <HI>Little Lady;</HI> to denote a &s;econd Prince&s;s, that has another above her. This Lady was retir'd to <HI>Vijapour,</HI> and toward the end of her days was de&s;irous to make a Pilgrimage to <HI>Mecca,</HI>
<PB N="151" REF="296">
carrying along with her an immen&s;e Trea&s;ure. In pur&s;uance of this Pilgrimage &s;he pa&s;&s;ed through <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> But <HI>Habas</HI> II. for rea&s;ons that never were yet well under&s;tood, having her in his Power, would not permit her to go any farther, nor to re|turn out of his Dominions, tho &s;he offer'd &s;everal times con&s;i|derable Pre&s;ents to obtain that favour. The new Prince, and that year the New <HI>Soleimaan,</HI> did not &s;hew him&s;elf &s;o in&s;en&s;ible of the Ladies Pre&s;ents, as his Father had done, but conde&s;cended to what &s;he de&s;ir'd, and receiv'd from her a Trea&s;ure of Jewels of an ine&s;timable value.</P>
<P>For &s;he took her time one day that the King pa&s;s'd by the Hou&s;e where &s;he had been lodg'd, and went forth her &s;elf with her Pre&s;ents and her Petition. She had al&s;o prepar'd a &s;umptu|ous Banquet to be made ready in the Court that belong'd to the Hou&s;e, and caus'd the Street to be &s;pread with Cloth of Gold for the King to ride over; and as he rode along, her Officers came and threw under his Hor&s;es feet whole handfuls of money both Gold and Silver, to the value of two thou&s;and Crowns. Which is a piece of Pomp and Grandeur practis'd in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> when any one would honour the Prince after a more &s;plendid and obliging manner.</P>
<P>Toward the end of the year 1668. arriv'd in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> a new <HI>Mi&s;&s;i|on</HI> of <HI>Italian Capuchins,</HI> &s;ent by the <HI>Congregation</HI> for the <HI>Propagation of the Faith,</HI> for <HI>Georgia.</HI> They were &s;ix, attended by two Lay Bro|thers; their Superiour being call'd <HI>Father Steven d' Ameria.</HI> They al&s;o brought a Letter from the Pope to the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> of which I took a Copy in the&s;e words.</P>

<P>We have already given an account in part of what the <HI>Co&s;aques</HI> did this year upon the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, of the Commi&s;&s;ioners which they &s;ent to Court, with whom the Council was not &s;atisfi'd; what means were us'd to di&s;cover their Intentions; and whether there were not &s;ome deceit conceal'd under that Depu|tation. We &s;hall here add the &s;econd Inroad which they made, and what &s;poyl they committed more in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> the &s;ame year 1668.</P>
<P>While they were therefore di&s;puting at <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> whether they &s;hould take 'em for Friends or Enemies; The <HI>Co&s;aques,</HI> who&s;e Commi&s;&s;ioners were now returning back, as all that they had done was only to amu&s;e the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> (though they had been treated with good words, and had receiv'd promi&s;es very advantageous for their Colony) continu'd their de&s;ign of plundering and pillaging all the Maritime Regions of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> to the Ea&s;t. To which pur|po&s;e they quit <HI>Save,</HI> and directing their March toward the more Ea&s;tern Provinces of the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, they &s;ail'd &s;eventy Leagues
<PB N="153" REF="297">
without being de&s;cry'd from the Land, and land at <HI>Ferhabaad</HI> the Capital City of <HI>Mazenderaan.</HI> They landed in the di&s;gui&s;e of Merchants, went up and down the Market places, and into the Shops like People that had no great skill in Traffick, and yet had &s;omething both to buy and to &s;ell. They let go their Ducats of Gold for five <HI>Shayet,</HI> which make not &s;o much as two Shil|lings, &s;old Engli&s;h Cloth for four <HI>Aba&s;&s;es,</HI> or five &s;hillings &s;ix pence the Ell. On the other &s;ide the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> while this Trade la&s;ted care&s;s'd the <HI>Co&s;aques</HI> at a high rate, finding 'em &s;uch admi|rable Cu&s;tomers, and Chapmen both together, and look'd upon 'em as <HI>Cullies</HI> and Novices which their kind Stars had brought among 'em: But the &s;ixth day, continuing their Game, at the hour prefix'd among them&s;elves, at what time they had &s;catter'd them&s;elves in &s;everal parts of the City to avoid &s;u&s;pi|cion, they drew their Swords, &s;lew all they met, plunder'd the Hou&s;es, and laden with Booty, after they had kill'd above five hundred per&s;ons, they return'd to their Ve&s;&s;els, lying &s;till out of ken at Sea.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t con&s;iderable, and a lo&s;s not to be repair'd, was the ruine of the King's Palace, a mo&s;t &s;tately Pile, &s;eated in the mid&s;t of the City, wherein was kept a va&s;t Trea&s;ure of Di&s;hes and Ba&s;ins of Porcellane, or China, Cornaline, Agate, Coral, Amber, Cups of Cry&s;tal of the Rock, and other Rari|ties without number, which tho&s;e Barbarians either broke or carry'd away. They al&s;o brake the great <HI>Haou&s;e,</HI> or <HI>Tangi,</HI> being a Ja&s;per Fountain cover'd with Plates of Gold and erected with|in the Palace. Every time I think of the Magnificence and Delightfulne&s;s of that place, where I was in the year 1666. I cannot but lament its hard Fate; and had the Reader &s;een the De|&s;cription which I have made of it, he would acknowledge that &s;uch a wonder of Art de&s;erv'd a kind of perpetuity.</P>
<P>In <HI>Ferhabaad</HI> and the parts adjoyning there are &s;ome few Chri|&s;tians &s;till remaining of that va&s;t number which <HI>Habas</HI> the Great formerly brought in to people that Country &s;ome &s;ixty years ago, which has &s;o much le&s;&s;en'd their Number, that there is not the &s;ixtieth part of what there was before: and the mo&s;t part of the&s;e for worldly Intere&s;ts have embrac'd the Mahumetan Super&s;tition. Tho&s;e few Chri&s;tians that remain'd knowing that the <HI>Co&s;aques</HI> were likewi&s;e Chri&s;tians, to &s;ave them&s;elves from their fury, and their Hou&s;es from being plunder'd, when they &s;aw 'em coming, cri'd out <HI>Chri&s;tous, Chri&s;tous,</HI> and the better to let 'em under&s;tand they were Chri&s;tians &s;ign'd them&s;elves with the &s;ign of the Cro&s;s from head to foot, &s;o that the <HI>Co&s;aques</HI>
<PB N="154" REF="298">
hearing 'em invoke that adorable Name, and &s;eeing how they cro&s;s'd them&s;elves, not only &s;par'd their lives, but protected their Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of <HI>Ferhabaad,</HI> who had &s;av'd their lives by flight, return'd the next day betimes in the Morning, to pick up what was left of their Goods: but while they were thus bu|&s;ily employ'd, the <HI>Co&s;aques</HI> landed a &s;econd time, and now more greedy of humane Bloud, than of Plunder, kill'd about &s;even hundred, and took as many Pri&s;oners, and then retir'd for good and all.</P>
<P>By this time Winter was come, which they re&s;olv'd to &s;pend in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and to that purpo&s;e they &s;ought out for a Place where they might quarter together in &s;ecurity. Now ju&s;t again&s;t the City of <HI>Ferhabaad</HI> there lies a <HI>Penin&s;ula,</HI> or Tongue of Land that runs forward into the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea about ten or eleven Leagues. This place did abound in Harts, wild Boars, wild Goats, and other &s;orts of wild Veni&s;on: It is al&s;o full of Fore&s;ts and fre&s;h Water, nor does it want any thing that is convenient for the &s;upport of Humane Life, and is therefore a mo&s;t con|venient place for Habitation: The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> call it <HI>Mionn&egrave;-Kell&egrave;</HI> or the <HI>Middle-&s;iz'd Horn,</HI> thereby denoting a Tongue of Land that runs out into the Sea; there it was that the <HI>Co&s;aques</HI> entrench'd them&s;elves. To which purpo&s;e they made their Pri&s;oners work day and night to dig a large Trench about their Camp; and then with &s;everal great Trees pe&s;ter'd one with|in another, and fill'd up with Turf, they rais'd a kind of a Bulwark, upon which they planted their <HI>Badelieg&egrave;</HI> or great Guns, for their better defence.</P>
<P>This was that which the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> de&s;ir'd; for as &s;oon as they under&s;tood they were fortifi'd in that place, the &s;ame year, not|with&s;tanding the Winter &s;ea&s;on, they attack'd 'em, and being &s;tronger by Land than the <HI>Co&s;aques,</HI> they beat 'em, retook all their Pri&s;oners, and con&s;train'd the Enemy to betake them&s;elves to their Ve&s;&s;els, with which, after they had roam'd about the whole <HI>Penin&s;ula</HI> on every &s;ide, they found at the farthe&s;t end a more advantageous Po&s;t, as being defended by a Mar&s;h, where they &s;topp'd with their Booty, and their little Barks, at which time I came away for <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
