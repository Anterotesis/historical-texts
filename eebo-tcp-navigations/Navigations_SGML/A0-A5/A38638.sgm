<HEAD>TO THE Honourable COMMITTEE OF PARLIAMENT Appointed To Bring in a BILL for &s;ettling <HI>an Ea&s;t-India</HI> COMPANY. The Publi&s;her humbly dedicates the en&s;uing Treati&s;e concerning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> COMPANY and TRADE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A Committee being appointed to draw up a Bill for &s;ettling <HI>An Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company, no he&s;itation remained whom to Addre&s;s the en&s;uing Papers to, they properly belonging to your &s;elves; they were drawn up two years &s;ince for the &s;atisfaction of <HI>an eminent worthy Member</HI> of the preceding Par|liament, and upon its di&s;&s;olution was thrown wholly by, but is now judged conve|nient to be publi&s;hed, hoping it may be of &s;ome good u&s;e, &s;eeing that the &s;ame work is on &s;oot again and in greater forwardne&s;s; the di&s;tance of time from its drawing up may have altered circum&s;tances, &s;o as that &s;ome directions and propo&s;als may have abatement of their Energy, particularly that in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> concerning Tunnage is now of no &s;ignificancy more than to &s;hew the kindne&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Author to them; but in all other things with a &s;mall allowance it may &s;erve indifferently for the pre|&s;ent Meridian.</P>
<P>Many and various are the directions and propo&s;als that are offered, but none of them at all contrary but agreeable to the Regulations concerted by the Hou&s;e, but more inlarged and dilated; &s;ome there are wholly new as in p. <HI>8.9.12.</HI> to <HI>18.</HI> all which, as they are projected for the enlargement and &s;ecurity of the Trade and great Advan|tage of the Nation throughout, will no doubt be well taken notice of and be &s;eriou&s;ly pondered and weighed by you; and if approved of, in&s;erted in the draught; Read &s;e|riou&s;ly, Judge deliberately: Two grand Objections are every where vigorou&s;ly buzz'd about by the Company and their Friends, to hinder the Mutation of this pre&s;ent Stock and Management. One is that a Change is hugely for the <HI>Dutch</HI> Advantage, that they would give <HI>500000 l.</HI> to have a new one e&s;tabli&s;hed: We are &s;ure the <HI>Dutch</HI> are great Husbands of their Mony, and part not with it but upon advantageous Terms, which how they will find in a new Company rightly e&s;tabli&s;hed (as they have <HI>plainly</HI> done in the <HI>Old One</HI>) is not ea&s;ie to apprehend. It mu&s;t be conceded the <HI>Dutch</HI> as Traders to <HI>India</HI> have been always Cordial Enemies to us; and in all
<PB N="ii" REF="3">Ages given full A&s;&s;urances thereof; 'tis with them as with <HI>Hannibal,</HI> &s;worn in his Childhood at the Altar never to have Peace with the <HI>Romans;</HI> agreeable whereto are the In&s;tructions and Actions of their Servants at all times and in all places. Hence the Spice Trade was ravi&s;hed from us, our Men &s;lain with mo&s;t barbarous unexam|pled cruelty at <HI>Amboyna,</HI> and many other Places and Trades were we deceived of formerly without any publick reparation, but in this Companies time the <HI>Dutch</HI> have made their Advances quick and thick; fre&s;h in Memory is their robbing us of <HI>Ma|ca&s;&s;er,</HI> &s;weeping away <HI>Poleroon</HI> a Spice I&s;land, but through Corruption and Bribery never improved by the Company; &s;o likewi&s;e <HI>Bantam, Jambee,</HI> and all Dependencies, a va&s;t Trade mightily beneficial to the Nation; &s;everal places on the Coa&s;t of <HI>India;</HI> and then the great Prejudice they did us, and Streights they put us to on the We&s;t Coa&s;t, tho no Advantage in the lea&s;t to them, being a perfect malicious Act: And indeed whatever they have &s;et upon hath been gone thorough with great ea&s;ine&s;s, and &s;ubmitted to with eminent tamene&s;s, and the rea&s;on is all along the <HI>India</HI> Concern hath been e&s;teemed a bare Mercantile Affair, &s;o that the Nation hath never interpo&s;ed. When did the Company ever Addre&s;s the Parliament upon any of the&s;e Accounts? no, they knew they were upon an illegal wrong bottom, &s;o dur&s;t not appear before them, and of them&s;elves they had not Stock wherewith to cope and engage with <HI>the Ad|ver&s;ary,</HI> and rather than A&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;hould be given they have bowed down tho to the Nations great injury, patching up Affairs as well as they could by private Cor|re&s;pondencies, which the <HI>Dutch</HI> under&s;tand as well as the <HI>French;</HI> and &s;ometimes to colour the bu&s;ine&s;s making a great noi&s;e and bu&s;tle, &s;ending a Foreigner to demand &s;atisfaction and adju&s;t Differences, and it may be make &s;ome Preparations, when all is but to cloud the private Intrigue carried on here; thus &s;ome treachero<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s Go|vernours in our days (we may now forget <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Stanley</HI>) when they have made their private pact with the Enemy, will burn and ravage all out parts, drain all they can from the Inhabitants, and then with a &s;pecious Treaty make a rendition; and then the Scene is over. So that its impo&s;&s;ible for any in their Wits to believe the <HI>Dutch</HI> Favo|rers of a New, and Enemies to the pre&s;ent Company, with whom they have &s;uch pri|vate Concerts, and whom they find &s;o ea&s;ie an Enemy, having often foiled them, they know their &s;trength and can cru&s;h them as they plea&s;e. Now to cure this, it need not be &s;aid <HI>delenda e&s;t Carthago,</HI> but let our Trade be &s;ettled on as firm a ba&s;is as theirs is, by making it National, and a Trade of the State, with a real &s;ub&s;tantial &s;ufficient fund, as is propo&s;ed in this Scheme, we &s;hall then &s;tand upon even ground, and be able to cope with them on all occa&s;ions, having as good &s;upport as them&s;elves, and our State to back <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">heirs to back them, and nothing el&s;e will pre&s;erve us from their Encroachments. So that its rather to be judged the <HI>Dutch</HI> would on the contrary give <HI>500000</HI>l. to have this Company continued, than a new one &s;ettled; it being &s;o much for their Intere&s;t if to be compa&s;&s;ed, the pro&s;pect of a New Company &s;ettled as propo&s;ed being, as all ob&s;erving Per&s;ons in <HI>Holland</HI> know, like a Dagger at the heart of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Company.</P>
<P>The other Objection is, that the Concern of Widows and Orphans will &s;uffer by this Mutation; it doth not appear who the&s;e Widows and Orphans are, there be|ing but few upon the la&s;t li&s;t, and fewer that were con&s;iderably concerned, it being cu&s;tomary for Widows to &s;ell out as &s;oon as the Husband dyes, having any great Stock: &s;o that not the tithe of any Widows E&s;tate may be computed to be therein. It's &s;omewhat &s;trange the Orphans and Widows &s;hould be the Object of the Compa|nies care, they have made many &s;uch deplorable Objects, but this is the fir&s;t In&s;tance of any Compa&s;&s;ion in them, and 'tis from &s;ome by ends becau&s;e not univer&s;al; for why el&s;e &s;hould not the poor St. <HI>Helenian,</HI> as well as the rich <HI>London</HI> Widows be regard|ed? But to be &s;hort if the Account delivered into the Hou&s;e be true, there can be no lo&s;s, and if otherwi&s;e, tho&s;e that have been concerned any con&s;iderable time can have but very &s;mall lo&s;s if any, having been Partakers of large Dividends, and tho&s;e
<PB N="iii" REF="3">that have come in lately (of which there may for &s;mall Summs po&s;&s;ibly be one or two) have had fair warning to take heed year after year, and if yet they will venture, who &s;hall take care for them? They have had time to &s;ell and yet may; if Per&s;ons come in upon illegal Foundations and Titles they take their lot, the State is not obliged to make them good. Many a Widow and Orphan are cheated, and &s;ometimes of all they have by deceitful Mortgages and had Titles, and &s;o remain without remedy; Per&s;ons may fall into a condition that may be pitied, but not re|dre&s;&s;ed as every <HI>term</HI> gives in&s;tances of. The&s;e Widows and Orphans if any there be, have been Partakers of all benefits in the Dividends made upon the Goods brought home by <HI>Andrews</HI> and that Crew obtained by Plunderings, Spoiles, Pi|racies, &amp;c. and that without &s;hewing any remor&s;e; there being no in&s;tance of any Prote&s;t made again&s;t the &s;ame in the behalf of either Widow or Orphan, and is it inju&s;tice that they who without any &s;cruple freely and plea&s;ingly &s;hare of all Advan|tages in evil ways do al&s;o partake of the bitter fruits if any be? What care hath been taken for the Widows and Orphans that &s;uffer by the Exchequer? and yet that is a kind of Crown debt. What hath hitherto been done in behalf of the Orphans of <HI>London</HI> after &s;o many years Attendance, who&s;e ca&s;e differs much and more to be pitied? They had mo&s;t of them their all therein, and the&s;e b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a pittance; their mony was forced into the Chamber by the Law of the Land, &s;o that the State &s;eems an&s;werable in honour at lea&s;t for their monies: Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e came in freely and upon an unju&s;t Title contrary to the Laws of the Land, and that known beforehand. But to turn the Tables there is no lo&s;s of any thing likely to come to the Widows, &amp;c. The Chief Managers and Gainers giving &s;ecurity to make good their Principle; and there is no de&s;ign in this Scheme to take away a Farthing of what is theirs. The New Sub&s;cribers come not in to partake of any thing of theirs, but to &s;hare of their own, the liberty of Trade; and no one can complain when nothing of theirs is taken away, but they enjoy whatever is their own be it little or much; &s;o that all the noi&s;e and clamour about Widows and O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">phans va|ni&s;hes like d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w again&s;t the Sun. &V;pon the whole tho the&s;e People have in all points behaved them&s;elves with great indecency, rudene&s;s, and ingratitude, taking all op|portunities to reflect upon what the Hou&s;e hath done, notwith&s;tanding all the kind|ne&s;s, favour, and &s;uperabundant mercy they have been treated with, &s;o as no Socie|ty of People ever were, con&s;idering the woful circum&s;tances they are under; they have had the Trade to them&s;elves for &s;ome <HI>34</HI> years, and &s;till nothing will plea&s;e them but a Continuance, and all the re&s;t of the Nation to be di&s;&s;eized of their Right there|to; but its hoped by the benigne i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fluence of <HI>the Hou&s;e,</HI> &s;uch a Model will by your wi&s;doms be agreed on and carried in as may rejoyce the hearts of all true Engli&s;h|men, by &s;ettling this great Trade upon its true Ba&s;is, <HI>Liberty</HI> and <HI>Property.</HI></P>

<P N="1">1.

<P N="3">3.

<P N="4">4.

<P N="6">6.

And how well they proved it, the Honourable Committee of Parliament can well remember. What they farther did by their Orders in <HI>India</HI> and here, &s;hall at pre&s;ent be pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence: Only I &s;hall note, That the <HI>Andalu&s;ians</HI> were Impeached by the Company of the very &s;ame Crime here, which they them&s;elves were acting by then Servants and Orders in <HI>India</HI> at the &s;elf-&s;ame time: And if it were &s;o Cri|minal in the <HI>Andalu&s;ians;</HI> why it &s;hould be &s;o highly prai&s;e-worthy in the Company, &s;eems difficult to conceive. Nor doth the Bitterne&s;s of their Spirits appear le&s;s noto|rious at pre&s;ent, in&s;omuch that even civil Conver&s;e is not admitted by them; and all that are not ju&s;tly of their Minds for the continuance of this Stock, contrary to the Laws of the Land and Right of the Subject, are &s;tigmatized with the inviduous Names of Interlopers, and Enemies to the Company and the Crown; on purpo&s;e, as may ju&s;tly be con|ceived, to make a Faction and Party. <HI>And can Two walk together if they be not agreed?</HI> No more can any good ari&s;e from the Vamping this Company by a Conjunction of Stocks, while they are at &s;o great Emnity with tho&s;e that de&s;ire a &s;hare in Trade with them; &s;o &s;hould there be any mixture of Councils, what Agreement would there be? Nay rather, what Cla&s;hings would there not be, every Trifle occa&s;ioning a Tempe&s;t? and what mu&s;t be the event, but that the Hatred in the Old <HI>Caballi&s;ts</HI> again&s;t tho&s;e that &s;hould Graft or Vamp, would bring great Detriment, if not De&s;truction on the whole?

Sure it is, without &s;ome Harmony in Affection, there can be no plea&s;ant, profitable, intimate Conver&s;ation; and the&s;e Gentlemen, the pre&s;ent Managers, have by a many years continued Series of Conduct, given mo&s;t evident De|mon&s;tration of the unfitne&s;s of their Temper, for any &s;uch Conjunction and Commu|nion; and the unrelenting Hardne&s;s of Heart that undeniably appears upon them at this day, &s;ufficiently manife&s;ts their Di&s;po&s;ition unaltered, and mo&s;t difficultly, if at all change|able; &s;o that the Proverb holds good: <HI>The Ethiopian changeth not his Skin, nor the Leopard his Spots.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. This Company is of a mo&s;t <HI>ignoble Extract</HI> and <HI>Original,</HI> having its fir&s;t <HI>Settlement</HI> in times of great Confu&s;ion; being Incorporated by <HI>Oliver Cromwell,</HI> about the time when <HI>what</HI> he called a Parliament, declared and inaugurated him Lord Protector of the&s;e Na|tions; and &s;eems to be one of his fir&s;t <HI>Royal</HI> Donatives, or rather a <HI>&s;pecimen</HI> of his in|tended Government, it being exqui&s;itely adapted thereto, by its plenty of <HI>Arbitrary</HI> Clau&s;es: Which the concerned apprehending (as may be &s;uppo&s;ed) &s;ome Benefit by, might by fit means procure to be continued in the Charter obtained of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, upon his Re&s;toration; which was no other in reality than a Confirmation or E&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the former, there being no <HI>new</HI> Sub&s;criptions, nor <HI>Stock,</HI> or <HI>Per&s;ons,</HI> but the &s;ame without any Enlargement, or alteration. Now this was far from being a <HI>National</HI> Joynt-Stock in its <HI>Ri&s;e,</HI> in regard it had its beginning and was &s;et on foot, as
<PB N="8" REF="8">it were in hugger mugger, without any due publick notice given to all parts, and in a time when the greate&s;t part of the Nobility, Gentry, and Merchants of the Land, could not, or <HI>dur&s;t</HI> not Sub&s;cribe, and many others but very little, having been under the <HI>Fines</HI> and <HI>Seque&s;trations</HI> of or Obnoxions to an <HI>Inqui&s;ition,</HI> by the <HI>Petentates</HI> of <HI>Haberda&s;hers-Hall;</HI> one of which continued a <HI>Cen&s;or</HI> to his dying Day, or near it, in the Committee, for their Di|rection and In&s;truction, no doubt, in &s;uch Affairs: (and it mu&s;t be owned, he lo&s;t not his la|bour, they having made great <HI>Impr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters">ments</HI> therein): So that it became rather a <HI>private</HI> Bargain, or <HI>packt</HI> Juncto of <HI>Olivers,</HI> than a <HI>Nati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">nal</HI> Stock, or Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">any; in&s;omuch that con&s;ider|ing its <HI>Birth, Founder,</HI> and <HI>De&s;ign.</HI> it w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">l be conceived very inconvenient to Graft up|on, and may be wondred it &s;hould be pre&s;&s;ed; but what will not Intere&s;t do? And &s;ure|ly none of clear Spirits de&s;irou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> to remain, and be e&s;teemed <HI>Free</HI> Subjects, can with|out great <HI>di&s;dain</HI> have any Thoughts of <HI>Grafting</HI> on this pre&s;ent <HI>Stock,</HI> and <HI>Con&s;titution;</HI> (it being a Vamping <HI>Nel</HI>'s <HI>Old Boots</HI>) but that a <HI>new One</HI> be Erected agreeable to the Laws of the Land.</P>
<P N="8">8. This Company, by rea&s;on of many late A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">ions hath fallen into great Di&s;repute with the Natives and Government of <HI>India,</HI> among whom the Affairs of that Trade are negotiated, and brought a Scandal upon the whole Nation; that we who were in Repute a|bove all other Europians in former days, are now become a Reproach among tho&s;e Heathens. And to continue and Graft upon this Company or Stock, will but ju&s;tifie all late unbecoming, unju&s;t Actions and Mi&s;managements, and bind our Reproach upon us: Therefore to take off all that Odium the Nation lies under in the &s;ight of tho&s;e Heathens, and to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;tore our &s;elves to that former <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Credit</HI> we had with them; nothing can more conduce (ac|cording to the be&s;t of my judgment) then an entire Di&s;&s;olution of the pre&s;ent Stock or Com|pany, and Erecting a new One with a greater Fund, and better Con&s;titutions, that it may be as it ought, A <HI>National</HI> Stock and Trade. This may be &s;ufficient to be added concerning Grafting: And &s;eeing this Company did not Graft upon the former, or e|ver it was done before, and that &s;o to do, is again&s;t the Right of the Subject; and that the pre&s;ent Stock is a mo&s;t grievous <HI>Monopoly,</HI> and involved in great Troubles with the Subjects of <HI>England,</HI> by violent and illegal Actions, its Trade brought to a very low ebb, and all endangered; and &s;till the bitter Emnity of the pre&s;ent Managers towards their fellow Subjects remaining, thereby prohibiting any fair Conjunction; as al&s;o con&s;ider|ing its odd and ignoble Birth under <HI>Oliver Cromwell,</HI> and the great Reproach (by their late uncharitable Actions towards the <HI>Indians</HI>) they have ca&s;t upon the Nation; it will undoubtedly by all <HI>Patriots</HI> be judged expedient not to be Grafted on, but rather <HI>di&s;&s;olved,</HI> and a <HI>new</HI> one <HI>Erected.</HI> And &s;o I come to the next Point; which is,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The other way propo&s;ed for enlarging the Stock for the <HI>India</HI> Trade; and that is, by E&s;tabli&s;hing a new <HI>National</HI> Joynt-Stock by new Sub&s;criptions, and Di&s;&s;olving this pre&s;ent Joynt Stock, which &s;eems mo&s;t proper and only pra|cticable at this time. Now in proceeding to this Work, and &s;ettling thereof; it's humbly conceived the&s;e or the like Methods be u&s;ed.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That this New <HI>National</HI> Joynt-Stock be enlarged to Sixteen Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds at lea&s;t, by new Sup&s;criptions; that &s;o, being National, the whole Body of the Nation may come in and partake thereof; and that it may be a &s;ecure <HI>Fund</HI> or <HI>Bank</HI> for the Nation to employ its money on.</P>
<P>Secondly, That this New <HI>National</HI> Joynt-Stock or Company, be Confirmed and made a Corporation by Act of Parliament, exclu&s;ive to all others from the <HI>Cape of Good Hope</HI> to the Ea&s;tward of <HI>Japan;</HI> and that the Trade to <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> be declared a Trade of the <HI>State,</HI> or the <HI>Kingdom;</HI> as indeed it will be by the whole Nation, (willing thereto) having Intere&s;t therein, as well as Right thereunto: So that hereafter all <HI>Abu&s;es</HI> and <HI>Injuries</HI> done them in their <HI>Trade</HI> and <HI>Rights</HI> in tho&s;e parts by any other <HI>Nations,</HI> may be judged and reputed as done not only to the particular concerned, but to the <HI>Nation,</HI> and be e&s;pou&s;ed accordingly; which may be a means of pre&s;erving what we have, and regaining &s;ome|what at lea&s;t of what lo&s;t; and prevent our own People from an ea&s;ie parting, with any the <HI>Privileges, Ports, Trade</HI> or <HI>Rights</HI> in tho&s;e Parts, and others of our <HI>Neighbour Nations</HI> from invading them: Want of which has been of <HI>irreparable</HI> Damage to the Nation in the Lo&s;s of many Places, and great Trades in tho&s;e Parts, in former and later Days; as the <HI>Spice Trade,</HI> that of <HI>Maca&s;&s;es, Japan, Jacquatra</HI> or <HI>Batavia</HI> and <HI>Bantam, &amp;c.</HI> And it will be a great Encouragement to all Per&s;ons Endeavours, in advancing the &s;aid Trade, and
<PB N="9" REF="8">in all Acqui&s;itions in tho&s;e parts, it not being only for a private but <HI>national</HI> Intere&s;t; and this is that which greatly &s;timulates the <HI>Dutch</HI> in all their enlargements. The pre&s;ent Com|pany hath in their Charter a larger extent and tract of the World included then is here pro|po&s;ed for a new one, <HI>viz.</HI> from the <HI>Cape Good Hope</HI> down to the <HI>Magellanean</HI> Strait, and thence all Southward, and &s;o all the back of <HI>America</HI> to <HI>Japan,</HI> which here is thought good to be omitted as being of no u&s;e and ill fame to them, making a great Noi&s;e of the va&s;t|ne&s;s of their Charter; whereas they never made any benefit thereof but hindred others; therefore to be left free to all <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to Advantage them&s;elves, or on occa&s;ion to enda|mage other Nations by new di&s;coveries or what already known.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That <HI>non ob&s;tante</HI> the exclu&s;ive Clau&s;e, yet liberty be granted to all Ships to Trade to <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> and the Coa&s;t of <HI>Mo&s;ambique,</HI> and all other places on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africk</HI> on the other &s;ide or beyond the <HI>Cape of Good Hope</HI> while not Traded to by the Company; and that interfere not with the Companies Commerce; they giving &s;ecurity not to Trade but where allowed, and this to be without any Fee or Reward more than to the Clerk barely for the Writings.</P>
<P>Fourthly, That Diamonds, Pearls, and all pretious Stones, Ambergreece and Musk, be left free to all natural born Subjects of <HI>England</HI> to Trade in, paying one <HI>per cent.</HI> for the Money &s;ent out, and 2 <HI>per cent.</HI> upon the Goods home, and that Gold and all Bullion im|ported thence be free.</P>
<P>Fifthly, That for the more equal and general di&s;tribution of the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade in this Realm, and the greater and more National enlargement thereof, it be carried on and ma|naged at &s;everal other Ports in the Land be&s;ides <HI>London;</HI> and &s;uch as are at &s;ome con&s;ider|able di&s;tance therefrom, <HI>viz.</HI> at <HI>York</HI> (who&s;e Sea Port may be <HI>Hull</HI>) <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> and <HI>Exon</HI> at each of which (and at more if afterwards thought needful) Pre&s;idencies may be erected for the management of the <HI>India</HI> Trade for the remoter Counties, as to in&s;tance more particularly: To <HI>York</HI> might pertain the Counties of <HI>Lincoln, Nottingham, Derby, York, Lanca&s;ter, Dur|ham, We&s;tmorland, Cumberland, Northumberland</HI> and <HI>Berwick</HI> upon <HI>Tweed:</HI> To <HI>Bri&s;tol; Glo|ce&s;ter, Worce&s;ter, Stafford, Che&s;ter, Salop, Hereford, Monmouth,</HI> and all the <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> Counties: To <HI>Exon; Wilts, Dor&s;et, Somer&s;et, Devon, Cornwall:</HI> Which Divi&s;ion if not judged propor|tionable may be altered and better &s;etled by Per&s;ons more vers'd in tho&s;e Parts. Now if this or &s;ome &s;uch way be taken the Ports being at &s;uch di&s;tance and remotene&s;s from the great City of <HI>London,</HI> will make no diminution to the Trade thereof, but be a great Ad|dition to that of tho&s;e places by an enlargement of their Exportations as well as con&s;um|ption in tho&s;e Parts of &s;ome of what imported which would ari&s;e meerly from &s;etting up &s;uch Marts; and truly the &s;o long Monopolizing this Commerce &s;olely to <HI>London,</HI> as it hath had many other ill effects, &s;o the Right of the Subject hath been highly violated, in his being deprived of what by the law of the Land is his native Due and Property; and its hoped may now at length be well con&s;idered of by the Members for tho&s;e parts and re&s;to|red to them, it &s;eeming highly unrea&s;onable that the Nobility, Gentry, Merchants, and Inhabitants of tho&s;e parts &s;hould be deprived and wholly dive&s;ted of their Birthright, only for the advancement of a few <HI>London</HI> Merchants: This way of diffu&s;ing the Trade would have (in my &s;lender Opinion) many great Advantages attending it; the Nation would then come to have a thorow in&s;ight into the immen&s;e Value of this important Trade, which it now is &s;o very ignorant of, that even very few &s;ave &s;ome of the concerned and o|thers in and about <HI>London</HI> have any tolerable cogni&s;ance thereof; and even many great and worthy Patriots and State&s;men have not till of late been throughly convinced of its Value; and from this ignorance of its being &s;o advantagious to this Nation, have mo&s;t of tho&s;e direful effects flowed in upon this Trade, <HI>Hinc illae lacrymae,</HI> as the lo&s;s of great Acqui&s;itions, Privileges, and Commerce in former days, and the great decay and almo&s;t total lo&s;s there|of now of late: It cannot enter into any mans heart acquainted with this Trade and its Va|lue, that if it had formerly been diffu&s;ed through the Nation, and &s;o had become a ge|neral Intere&s;t by all mens participating of its Gains, that ever &s;o great a part thereof could have been &s;o tamely parted with as was by our Progenitors, or &s;uch hard&s;hips put upon it as have been of late by the pre&s;ent Managers. No &s;ure; &s;hould any of the&s;e things have happened to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> in what a rage would the Commonalty have been! what fury would have appeared in the faces of the concerned? and what Con&s;ternation in all? as if their very banks were cutting? or the overflowing deluge of 72 were again breaking in upon them? who! that was any ways acce&s;&s;ary could have been &s;afe? When they lo&s;t <HI>Tywan</HI> the Go|vernor Mon&s;. <HI>Coyet</HI> a <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Gentleman of good e&s;teem tho he had in time given &s;ufficient
<PB N="10" REF="9">advice of what was coming, and when it came upon them, did all that man could do, and gave it not up till it could not be held any longer, and tho forced to it by all the People, (as I had it from them there pre&s;ent,) yet underwent many years Impri&s;onment in the remote Ea&s;tern I&s;lands ten times wor&s;e than death, e're he could get any Relea&s;e, tho &s;tript and de&s;titute of all; and yet we can part with our Trades at <HI>Japan, Spice I&s;lands, Maca&s;&s;er, Jaquatra,</HI> or <HI>Batavia,</HI> &amp;c. formerly; and with <HI>Bantam, Suratt,</HI> and <HI>Bengale</HI> lately, and &s;eem little concerned thereat: Such a Stoical Apathy have we been under and &s;till are in this Affair; and whence can this ari&s;e but from our ignorance of the Trade and its Value? which nothing can better cure than this di&s;tribution thereof and its management to &s;everal Pre&s;idencies and Marts, whereby the knowledge thereof will &s;en&s;ibly diffu&s;e it &s;elf through the whole Realm, and quicken us for hereafter to a preventing and redre&s;&s;ing of any Injuries that may be offered or done unto that Trade by any whom&s;oever, and po&s;|&s;ibly to regaining of &s;ome part thereof formerly lo&s;t; and by this means of di&s;tributing the <HI>India</HI> Trade to &s;everal Ports, there will be an immen&s;e Increa&s;e thereof, and Advantage thereby to this Nation as well abroad as at home, what a lu&s;tre would it give to our repu|tation in tho&s;e parts now at &s;o low an ebb, and what benefit particularly would accrue to all Traders and Merchants as well as the Adventurers therein, may be judged by what it hath done formerly when it flouri&s;hed, tho not comparable to what it may do in this Method, and more e&s;pecially tho&s;e Marts and Pre&s;idencies that &s;hall be &s;et up, and the parts therea|bouts would be much increa&s;ed in their Trade and Commerce abroad and at home, and greatly populated and enriched, whereby the Coa&s;ts of tho&s;e parts would be much &s;trength|ned, together with a great Increa&s;e of Shipping and Mariners; as al&s;o a far greater Expor|tation of our Manufactures and Mines of this Kingdom, for this Trade having been only in the hands of a few Merchants in <HI>London,</HI> they never con&s;ider &s;o much the benefit of the Nation as their own particular emolument, nor e&s;pou&s;e the cau&s;e of our Woollen Manufa|cture and Mines as they might. But if this Method take place the We&s;t and the North being the very places for Woollen Manufactures and Mines, and the Nobility, Gentry, and Mer|chants thereof, concerned in the Trade and Management, will be able greatly to promote the Exportation of them, (and indeed <HI>India</HI> will take off a greater quantity of Cloth, Ser|ges, and Stuffs, as al&s;o Tinn, and Lead, then at pre&s;ent is by many apprehended,) for they &s;eeing with their own eyes and acting with their own hands, and having always the great &s;taple Commodities of their Country in their &s;ight and upon their hearts will make it their bu&s;ine&s;s to export the &s;ame, (which tho&s;e at a di&s;tance do not) and I am confident this will promote the Woollen Trade, as al&s;o our Mines of Tinn and Lead, more than any the Projects of late on foot, and much more of them be exported to <HI>India</HI> than formerly; and it will be a great conveniency to mo&s;t of the Gentry and Inhabitants in tho&s;e remote parts, that they may be &s;upplied with all <HI>India</HI> Commodities, as well for nece&s;&s;ary u&s;es as al&s;o for Adornment of them&s;elves, and their hou&s;es ornament; and the&s;e at ea&s;ie rates in their own Counties or near home, and make their own choice without chargeable tedious Journies to <HI>London,</HI> or being obliged to &s;ubmit to others Fancies. Now albeit this project of di&s;tri|buting this Trade and its management into other parts of the Land, may not at fir&s;t by many be well accepted as being &s;omewhat &s;trange, never before propo&s;ed, and &s;o e&s;teemed a Novelty, yet if well con&s;idered 'tis not &s;uch a Novel, having been one of the Con&s;titutive parts of the <HI>Dutch Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company; and all along by them practi&s;ed and &s;o de&s;igned in <HI>France</HI> al&s;o; yet however we of this Nation are in many things too &s;uper&s;titious, and &s;o over addicted to &s;ome old mouldy Cu&s;toms, as with <HI>I&s;&s;achar</HI> to bow and couch under (tho with heavy groans) the greate&s;t burthens rather than be at the pains and co&s;t to redre&s;s them, as might be in&s;tanced in many things relating both to our Civil and Eccle&s;ia&s;tick State; yet in &s;uch a Ca&s;e as this, wherein &s;o great a Concern is upon its Settlement, we are not to con&s;ider &s;o much what hath been done, but what is to be or may be done, for the Improvement, Securing and Advantaging this Trade; and accordingly the Nation thereby, not ought Cu&s;toms, Tradition, or Novelty in any mea&s;ure to ballance with the commodi|ou&s;ne&s;s of the Trade or Intere&s;t of the Nation. Thus much for the <HI>Fundamental Con&s;titutive Part of this Company.</HI></P>

<P N="3">3. That the Governor or Ma&s;ter and three Wardens or Deputies be Quadrinnial, one of them going off every Year, as the Governor the fir&s;t Year, the upper Warden &s;uc|ceeding him, and the &s;econd Warden him, and &s;o the third, in who&s;e place another is cho&s;en yearly, who may be the former Governor, or a new Man; or rather that the Governor or Ma&s;ter to be cho&s;en yearly, and the Wardens to be Triennial, one going off every Year; and this la&s;t &s;eems neare&s;t the way that is taken of many or mo&s;t of the Com|panies of <HI>London,</HI> and hereby a Per&s;on of any Ingenuity, will in the &s;aid three Years be thorowly ver&s;ed in all the governing Affairs of the Company.</P>

The&s;e Six ought to give more con&s;tant attendance, and be con&s;ider<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d accordingly, and the re&s;t of the Committee-men ought to be at a Court before it &s;its, and &s;tay the whole time, or to lo&s;e their <HI>Praemium;</HI> which will give them more in&s;ight into the bu&s;ine&s;s, and prevent that cu&s;tomary way of &s;tepping in only to &s;hew them&s;elves merely to have their Reward.</P>

<P N="8">8.

<P N="1">I. That the pre&s;ent Company being a Corporation, by its Di&s;&s;olution is not meant a di&s;&s;olving thereof in Law in a <HI>total, ab&s;olute, &s;imple, political,</HI> but in an <HI>active practical</HI> &s;en&s;e, whereby the Power of the pre&s;ent Managers, Management and Intere&s;t of the concern|ed cea&s;es as to Action, Conduct and Negotiation, and is totally laid a&s;ide, and a new Con&s;titution and Rule e&s;tabli&s;hed, and new Per&s;ons and Stock in&s;tituted as to Concern|ment, Negotiation, and Conduct, and carrying on the &s;aid Trade in an incorporated way, de&s;ign and method: So that a new one in this &s;en&s;e (as a Corporation) is only a Confirmation of the former or fir&s;t Corporation as to its <HI>political E&s;&s;ence</HI> or Foundation, being &s;till the &s;ame Corporation as was fir&s;t erected by Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> an. 1600, as 'tis &s;aid, but with Additions and Alterations &s;uited to the enlargement of the Trade, the pre|&s;ent Sentiments and Applications of tho&s;e concerned in, or &s;en&s;ible of the &s;aid Affair to tho&s;e in power; whereupon the new one being erected, the former immediately, as to its Power and Acting, becomes indeed as <HI>dead in Law,</HI> having no <HI>Power</HI> or <HI>Liberty</HI> to <HI>ex|ert</HI> any its former Authorities, or to act any ways in the lea&s;t as an incorporated Body in any its Conc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rns, but the new one comes in its place, and is in Law &s;till the <HI>&s;ame Cor|poration</HI> as the former, and is in their &s;tead in all points, being the legal Succe&s;&s;or of the former, as that was of tho&s;e which preceded it. Hence it follows,</P>
<P N="1">1. That there is no <HI>Interregnum, Interval, Ca&s;me,</HI> in the lea&s;t, between the di&s;&s;olving the pre&s;ent and erecting a new Company, but the one continues till the other takes place, as in the goings off and coming on of Mayors, Bayliffs, and other Officers in Corpora|tions, or &s;hifting the Committees of the pre&s;ent Company at the u&s;ual yearly time for &s;uch changes; which obviates any Su&s;picion or Thoughts Per&s;ons may have of any da|mage or prejudice that may ari&s;e to the Trade, or concerned while or during the tran|&s;ition of one Stock to the other.</P>

<P>Thus as &s;uccinctly and clearly as time and ability would permit, I have performed what you required of me; wherein from &s;everal undeniable Propo&s;itions previou&s;ly laid down, I have in general given you the re&s;ult of my judgment unbya&s;&s;ed and impartial, upon your Que&s;ti|on, <HI>viz. That the</HI> Ea&s;t-India <HI>Trade may be&s;t be managed in a National way for the publick benefit, by di&s;&s;olving of the pre&s;ent Company and erecting a new National Joynt-Stock more enlarged, diffu|&s;ed, on better Con&s;titutions, and under a Parliamentary Sanction.</HI> And in pro&s;ecution hereof it was propo&s;ed, <HI>That the</HI> India <HI>Trade being National, if managed by a Joynt-Stock it ought to be enlarged agreeable to the Trade;</HI> this is allowed on all hands, even the pre&s;ent Company not di&s;&s;enting to it; then the ways propo&s;ed for enlarging were examined, that of add|ing to the pre&s;ent Stock under its Con&s;titution pre&s;&s;ed by its Adventurers was rejected, the other way of erecting a new one con&s;idered, and approved, its fundamental Con|&s;titution delineated, and many Precepts laid down as nece&s;&s;ary thereto: And a further progre&s;s was made, wherein many things were offered as whol&s;ome methods for the due and prudent carrying on the Trade in a National beneficial way: And la&s;tly, I came to the di&s;&s;olution of this Company, wherein &s;uch Propo&s;als are tendred as makes it appear very fea&s;ible and facile without any prejudice to them as to the Trade by any Interval or Ca&s;me or any lo&s;s the Company can &s;u&s;tain in its Effects, and all tho&s;e difficult things of valuing dead Stock, making good all demands and dues from them, and to them and their neat Effects is rendred not only practicable but exceeding ea&s;ie and &s;afe; nor hath any thing (as I apprehend) been propo&s;ed under this la&s;t head that in the lea&s;t doth grate or bear hard upon them, but what they them&s;elves (if them&s;elves) mu&s;t heartily and readi|ly clo&s;e with) it being my &s;tudy &s;o to compo&s;e the&s;e methods, that they might have their right end in giving content to all Parties by a dividing to all their due Portions, and that in a per&s;picuous, quick, plain, cheap, equal way, which if effected is what I de&s;ired, and have mo&s;t cordially aimed at; if not, it is what I could atrain unto: And &s;uch is your candor as to accept of my unfeigned endeavours, and over-look and pardon my weakne&s;s. Now of the&s;e particulars that I have gone thro as nece&s;&s;ary to be con&s;idered both on the erection of a new Company and di&s;&s;olving the pre&s;ent or old one, it will be needful that &s;ome of them be in the body of the Charter or Act it &s;elf, others in the Preamble, and &s;ome only made by Laws, all which and others that may be nece&s;&s;ary, will pre&s;ent them|&s;elves upon peru&s;al of their Charters and Cu&s;toms, and con&s;ideration of the nature of the Affair. And as hinted at the beginning, it will be of great u&s;e that when the Bill be drawn up &s;ome Merchants and per&s;ons vers'd in the Affairs of <HI>India,</HI> men of clear Spi|rits, good Under&s;tanding, and of fair and even Tempers (not having been of the Ca|bals) be &s;ummoned to attend the Committee, and by &s;ome &s;elected Members thereof be con&s;ulted with, which may much conduce to the well modelling this grand Affair. If upon peru&s;al hereof your &s;elf, or imparting thereof to others, Objections do ari&s;e again&s;t any thing herein laid down, you know my in&s;ufficiency &s;o well not to impute it; but as to any el&s;e, I have to de&s;ire of them that they would not find fault with words barely, of which I freely confe&s;s my &s;elf no great Ma&s;ter, &s;o that it may not be apparel'd in a modern garb; and its hoped the Age is pa&s;t wherein Men were to be Criminals for a word; but as to the matter and &s;ub&s;tance, let them &s;earch thereinto, and object what they can, not doubting it will &s;tand the te&s;t, and be found agreeable to the Laws of God and Man, particularly our own Laws and Con&s;titutions. to Rea&s;on, Ju&s;tice, Equity, Con|&s;cience, Prudence, humane and divine, natural, moral, and &s;piritual, di&s;tributing to each one their real Right and Liberty, and dive&s;ting none of their ju&s;t Privilege and Property.
