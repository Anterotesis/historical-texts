<HEAD>A true Relation of the Frenche <HI>Kinge his good &s;ucce&s;se, in winning from</HI> the Duke of <HI>Parma,</HI> his forts and trenches, and &s;laieng 500. of his men, and the great famine that is now in the &s;ayd Dukes Campe.</HEAD>
<P>_MO&s;t true it is which the A|po&s;tle &s;aint <HI>Paule</HI> in the 13. to the <HI>Romans</HI> auoucheth of Kinges and Princes, &s;ai|eng there is no power but of God, and the powers that bee are ordained by God. And no le&s;&s;e true is that Golden &s;ayeng of the princelie Prophet Dauid, &s;peking in the per&s;on of God: by me kinges rule, and by me doo princes exerci&s;e authoritie.</P>
<P>Then it followeth nece&s;&s;arilie, that as kings and princes vppon earth are the ordinance of God, (and therefore tho&s;e that do re&s;i&s;t or re|bell again&s;t them doo re&s;i&s;t the power of God, and purcha&s;e to them&s;elues eternall damnati|on,

<P>Which thing the Lord hath mo&s;te notablie perfourmed euen the la&s;t day vpon the French King, that valiant &s;ouldiar of his, giuing vnto him mo&s;t happie and fortunate &s;ucce&s;&s;e again&s;t the Duke of <HI>Parma.</HI> VVho albeit he be other|wi&s;e a man of pui&s;&s;ance and valor, yet the Lord our God (ble&s;&s;ed be his holie name therfore) to manife&s;t to the worlde, how muche his at|tempt in aiding the rebellious Leaguers, a|gain&s;t their Soueraigne Kinge and liege Lord, dooth di&s;plea&s;e him, he cro&s;&s;eth him in his ac|tions, and as it were &s;tandeth before him, and fighteth again&s;t him, &s;ometimes &s;triking a &s;ud|daine terror and feare into his heart, with the re&s;t of his complices, and other-&s;ometimes o|uerthrowing them altogither in their owne plats and deui&s;es, according to the &s;ayeng of the P&s;almi&s;t, The wicked hath digged a pitte for others, but is fallen into it him&s;elfe.</P>
<P>But to come to the matter, as it plea&s;ed god it fell out thus.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Parma</HI> hauing now the &s;econd or third time inuaded the kingdom of France
<PB N="3" REF="3"> with a pui&s;&s;ant and mightie Armie, with in|tent to aide the rebellious Leaguers, agayn&s;te their lawfull Kinge, pa&s;&s;ing the confines, and entring (as it were) into the bowelles of the Realme, approched with his armie neere vnto the Cyttie <HI>Roane,</HI> who beeing pur&s;ued by the King and his people, drew him&s;elfe farther off towardes <HI>Newhauen,</HI> and there hee incamped him&s;elfe, rai&s;ing mo&s;t &s;trong Fortes, and erec|ting (as hee thought) trenches inuincible for his owne and his &s;ouldiers better defence: yea &s;o &s;tronglie had he intrenched him&s;elfe there, planting ordinance, Baricadoes, and other mi|litarie munition of infinite varietie, that hee thought him&s;elfe not onelye able to counter|uaile what &s;trength the king &s;hould be able to bende again&s;t him, but al&s;o he &s;uppo&s;ed him|&s;elfe to be in effect inexpugnable.</P>
<P>But as the prophet <HI>E&s;aias</HI> &s;aith, there is no wi&s;edome, there is no pollycie, there is no po|wer, nor &s;trength again&s;t the Lord, nor again&s;t his annointed.</P>
<P>For the King by &s;ecret intelligences or &s;pi|als, beeing aduerti&s;ed of the Duke his procee|dings, and how &s;tronglie he had fortified him &s;elfe in Trenches and bulwarks, with all po&s;&s;i|ble &s;peed marched towardes him, taking with him &s;uch a competent number of hor&s;&s;emen, and footmen, as he thought &s;ufficient to with|&s;tand the forces of the aduer&s;arie.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="4">
<P>Being come &s;omewhat neere the place, he cau&s;ed his armie to march forwarde both lea|&s;urelie and adui&s;edlie, the better to preuent &s;e|cret ambu&s;hes: and viewing with prouidente eie the manner of his enimies lyeng, their Fortes, their trenches, and other their muny|tions, at the la&s;t with mature adui&s;e, and mo&s;t peremptorie re&s;olution (as one that fighteth the Lords battels) in mo&s;t fierce manner a&s;&s;ai|led his enimies on euerie &s;ide.</P>
<P>And albeit the fight was both long and cru|ell, and &s;eemed a great while to hang in equall ballance, neither inclining vnto the one nor to the other, yet it plea&s;ed God, who continually fighteth for his &s;eruantes, that the Kinge pre|uayled.</P>
<P>And although he had not in his band &s;o ma|nie as the Enimie was by oddes, yet he wanne the Duke of <HI>Parma</HI> his Fortes and Trenches, mauger the heads of all his enimies, and for|ced his men to flie back and to retire to a more narrower place, beeing con&s;trained to fortifie them&s;elues anew, in &s;uch place as they coulde get on the &s;uddaine, and it is verilye thought that they can not be able to holde out longe again&s;t the forces of the King.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Parma</HI> al&s;o (&s;uch was the migh+tie hand of God again&s;t him) not onelye lo&s;te his fortes and trenches, but 500. of his chiefe&s;t &s;ouldiers al&s;o, be&s;ides other munition &amp; great
<PB N="5" REF="4"> &s;poiles.</P>
<P>The Duke is nowe pre&s;entlie &s;o driuen to the wall, and &s;o corbed vp, al hope of new &s;up|plies of viandes or victuals, being in &s;ome &s;orte intercepted and cut off from him, that he with his whole armie are &s;o &s;ore a&s;&s;ailed with famin, as that they are forced to eate their hor&s;&s;es for verie hunger.</P>
<P>Thus ha&s;te thou heard Gentle Reader the noble exploits of that valiant King of France, with his good &s;ucce&s;&s;e (which God continue:) and the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the duke of <HI>Parma</HI> with his retinue, who&s;e hande the Lorde of Ho&s;tes &s;horten, and &s;trengthen that illu&s;trious and re|noumed French King, that he may fighte the Lords Battels &s;till, that once (if it be his ble&s;&s;ed will) poperie, &s;uper&s;tition and Idolatrie maye bee cleane rooted out, and true religion maie vniuer&s;ally be planted in all Chri&s;tian Kinge|domes of the world, Amen.</P>

<P>_IN the Go&s;pel of S. Mathew, the 24. Chapter, our &s;auiour Chri&s;t telleth vs of many &s;ignes and tokens, which &s;hal be &s;ent vnto vs and appeare before the day of iudgment, as that the &s;onne &s;halbe darkened, the Moone &s;hall loo&s;e hir light, the Starres &s;hall fall from heauen, the earth &s;hall tremble, and &s;hake vn|der vs, the hilles &s;halbe &s;upplanted and remo|ued out of their places: the Seas &s;hall roare and make a hideous noy&s;e, there &s;hall be wars and rumours of warres in all countries, and &s;uch like. All which &s;ignes and tokens we &s;ee to be come to pa&s;&s;e alreadie. For if wee take
<PB N="14" REF="9"> the &s;onne in that place, for the &s;onne of God Chri&s;t Ie&s;us (as all &s;ound expo&s;itions and in|terpretors haue done:) howe often haue wee &s;eene him darkened, and ob&s;cured with the filthy mi&s;tes, and &s;tincking vapors of mens tra|ditions. The Moone that is the Churche of God, how was &s;hee darkened, yea almo&s;t de|priued of her light vnder the tyrannie of An|techri&s;t the pope of Rome and his &s;hauelings? The Starres, that is the pa&s;tors, and mini&s;ters of the Church, how were they driuen away a|mong&s;t the Papi&s;tes, from the firmament of &s;ounde doctrine, and pure conuer&s;ation. But if we take the&s;e &s;ignes literally, howe ma|nie times haue we &s;eene the &s;unne and moone to be eclip&s;ed, and almo&s;t manie times to lo&s;e their whole light. What woonderfull and &s;trange coniunctions of Starres of &s;ignes and plannets, threatning euen an vniuer&s;all con|&s;ummation of all things haue we &s;eene of late yeares. The like was neuer &s;een of many yeares before. What firie meteers, bla&s;ing Starres, Comets, and other fearefull impre&s;&s;ions haue we &s;eene in the ayre of late yeers? What inun|dations and ouerflowings of the &s;eas and wa|ters? What fearefull earthquakes? What remo|uing of hilles out of their places? What Abor|tiues, fearefull and mon&s;trous birthes? What warres and rumours of warres in all countries, doe we heare of in the&s;e daies? All which are
<PB N="15" REF="9"> infallible tokens, and apparant arguments that the day of iudgement is at hand, and as it were before the dores. But although the Lord our God hath and doth dayly as well by the&s;e &s;ignes and tokens aboue named, and the like, as al&s;o by others of infinite varietie, &s;ummon vs to the doome, and warneth vs to be alwaies readie and prepared, yet hath hee not in anie age, nor to anie people, &s;ent a more fearefull, &s;trange, or woonderfull example (as it were a warning or caueat to all the world) then this that followeth, the trueth whereof was thus.</P>
<P>There is a certaine Iland called <HI>Palme</HI> nere to the <HI>Ingenio</HI> of <HI>Tertia</HI> court, three leagues from the Citie, and a league and a halfe from the &s;ea &s;ide, wherein grewe a certaine moun|tain or hil of three hundred faddam in height, and a league and a halfe in compa&s;&s;e. This mountaine or hill, the 19. of May beganne to burne, and &s;o continued &s;till burning till the 19. of Iulie next after, in mo&s;t &s;trange and fear|full maner.</P>
<P>Vpon the top of which hill there &s;eemed to be a great caue or gulfe: whereat i&s;&s;ued out great flames of fire; burning in &s;uche forcible and vehement maner, as they rai&s;ed vp withall and ca&s;t foorth huge and mightie &s;tones into the ayre, &s;tinging them vp with great violence, which &s;tones at the length de&s;cending downe againe foorth of the ayre, fell downe at the
<PB N="16" REF="10"> foote of the &s;ame hill. And yet notwith&s;tand|ing that it continually burned in this &s;ort, and ca&s;t forth infinite great and mon&s;trous &s;tones, yet the &s;aid hill remained &s;till in all mens iudg|ments as bigge as it was before. The heate of which fire was &s;uch, and &s;o great that the inha|bitants thereabouts were &s;ore annoyed there|by, hauing their vineyards and their corn &s;cor|ched and burnt vp thorow the rage and vyo|lence of the flames of fire that i&s;&s;ued thereout. And in this &s;orte it continued vntill the 20. of Iulie about midnight at which time the &s;ayd mount or hill, brake in &s;under, and &s;hiuered in peeces, cau&s;ed &s;uch great cracks and roringes, as though it had thundered, or a hundred can|nons had beene &s;hot off, to the great terror of the hearers.</P>
<P>It beeing thus di&s;&s;euered and broken, con|tinued burning: And burning (contrarye to the nature thereof before) con&s;umed and wa|&s;ted, till it came to be as it were a great coale of fire, from which cole there &s;eemed to a&s;cende and to ri&s;e vppe into the aire as it were great mountaines of &s;moke and &s;parkles of fire, as bigge in appearance as little barrels, and &s;o at the la&s;te the whole mountaine con&s;umed and burned away.</P>
<P>There gu&s;hed al&s;o foorth of the &s;ayd moun|taine (before it was con&s;umed) great &s;treames of water, burning like oile in the fire, and ca&s;t|ing
<PB N="17" REF="10"> vp woonderfull flames into the aire, which entred into the Sea fourty faddame, makinge all the water thereabout &s;o extreame hot, as it melted the pitch and ro&s;ine wherewith the Fi|&s;hers botes were pitched.</P>
<P>The heat of this burning water was &s;uch, as it &s;calded and killed all the fi&s;he neere therea|bouts, &s;o that aboundance of fi&s;he of all &s;ortes was found dead many dayes after.</P>
<P>From this mountaine al&s;o there tumbled downe to the Sea-&s;ide, beeing di&s;tante from thence a league and a halfe three mighty great &s;tones, one of them being 25. faddom in com|pa&s;&s;e, and with a woonderfull violence threw them&s;elues into the Sea fiftie faddame at the lea&s;t.</P>
<P>The hill being in this &s;ort quite con&s;umed, the &s;econd of Augu&s;t next following there rai|ned downe foorth of the aire, as it had beene whole &s;hewers of blacke a&s;hes, like gunpow|der in bigne&s;&s;e, which &s;poiled and con&s;umed all the Corne, gra&s;&s;e, and vines in the whole countrey about.</P>
<P>After this, namelie the fourth of Augu&s;t, it rained againe great &s;tore of white a&s;hes in the Cittie, the &s;treets being &s;o thicke couered ther|with as the people coulde not trauaile about their nece&s;&s;arie bu&s;ine&s;&s;e. Immediatlie after this: to wit, the fourth of September folowing, there appeared ouer the &s;ame Iland in the aire,
<PB N="18" REF="11"> other &s;trange and wonderfull &s;ights, as name|ly armed men to the number (as a man would haue thought) of 40000, one fighting again&s;te another in mo&s;t cruell &amp; bloudie maner, with &s;uch fearefull thundering, and terrible lighte|ning, as the like was neuer heard nor &s;een be|fore. The people &s;eeing the&s;e &s;trange &s;ightes, and feareful wonders, called to God for mer|cie: repented of their &s;innes, and in&s;tantlye be&s;ought the Lord that he would not enter in|to iudgement with them, nor puni&s;h them ac|cording to their de&s;ertes: whiche done, the Lord in mercy withdrew his plagues, and pu|ni&s;hmentes, (me&s;&s;engers of his wrath) from them, and receiued them to mercie. Thus ha&s;t thou heard courteous Reader, the true narra|tion of the wonderfull iudgementes of God again&s;t this people. The Lord giue both them and vs all grace, to make profite of them, and to amend our liues, that we may altogether in the great day of the Lord receiue the crown of euerla&s;ting glorie, promi&s;ed vnto vs tho|rough Ie&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord, Amen.</P>
