<HEAD><HI>A</HI> True report of the gainfull, pro&s;perous, and <HI>&s;peedy voiage to Iaua in the Ea&s;t Indies, performed</HI> by a fleet of 8. &s;hips of Am&s;terdam: which &s;et forth from <HI>Texell in Holland the fir&s;t of Maie 1598.

<P>_WHEREAS in the yeare of our Lord 1595. a certaine company of &s;ub&s;tantial merchants of Am|&s;terdam in Holland did build and &s;et forth for the Ea&s;t Indies four well appointed &s;hippes, whereof three came home An. 1597. with &s;mall profit (as already in &s;undry languages is declared) Yet neuerthele&s;&s;e the afore|&s;aid company, in hope of better &s;ucce&s;&s;e, made out the la&s;t yeare 1598. for a &s;econd voiage, a fleete of eight gallant &s;hips, to wit, The &s;hippe called the Mauritius, lately returned from that former voy|age, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Mauritius.</NOTE> being of burden two hundreth and thirty la&s;t, or foure hundreth and &s;ixty tunnes, or thereabouts. This &s;hippe was Admirall of the fleete. The Ma|&s;ter wherof was <HI>Godevart Iohn&s;on,</HI> the Commi&s;&s;a|rie or Factor <HI>Cornelius Heemskerck,</HI> and the Pilot <HI>Kees Collen.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="5">
The &s;econd &s;hip called the Am&s;terdam, was of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Am&s;terdam.</NOTE> burden of four hundreth &amp; &s;ixty tuns. The ma&s;ters name was <HI>Claes Iohn&s;on Melcknap;</HI> The Factor or commi&s;&s;arie <HI>Iacob Heemskerck.</HI></P>
<P>The third was named Hollandia, about the bur|den <NOTE PLACE="marg">3. Hollandia.</NOTE> of &s;ixe hundreth tuns: which had likewi&s;e been in the former voiage. The Ma&s;ter was <HI>Symon Lambert&s;on</HI> or <HI>Mawe,</HI> the Factor Ma&s;t. <HI>Witte Nijn,</HI> who died in the voyage before Bantam, and in his roome &s;ucceeded <HI>Iohn Iohn&s;on &s;mith.</HI></P>
<P>The name of the fourth &s;hip was Gelderland, of <NOTE PLACE="marg">4. Gelderland.</NOTE> burden about foure hundreth tuns. Ma&s;ter wher|of was <HI>Iohn Browne,</HI> Factor or commi&s;&s;arie <HI>Hans Hendrick&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>The fift was called Zeelandia, of the burden of <NOTE PLACE="marg">5. Zeelandia.</NOTE> three hundreth &amp; &s;ixtie tuns. The ma&s;ter was <HI>Iohn Corneli&s;on,</HI> the Commi&s;&s;ary or Factor <HI>N. Brewer.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ixt &s;hip named Vtrecht of the burden of <NOTE PLACE="marg">6. Vtrecht.</NOTE> two hundreth &amp; &s;ixtie tuns. The Ma&s;ter was <HI>Iohn Mart&s;en,</HI> the Factor or commi&s;&s;ary <HI>Adrian Veen.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;euenth, a pinnas called Fri&s;land, of burden <NOTE PLACE="marg">7. Fri&s;land.</NOTE> about &s;euenty tuns. The Ma&s;ter <HI>Iacob Corneli&s;on.</HI> The Factor <HI>Walter Willekens.</HI></P>
<P>The eighth, a pinnas that had been in the former <NOTE PLACE="marg">8. Oueri&s;&s;ell.</NOTE> voiage, called the Pidgeon, now y^e Ouerii&s;&s;el, of the burden of fifty tuns. The Ma&s;ter <HI>Symon Iohn&s;on.</HI> The Factor <HI>Arent Herman&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>Of this fleete was Generall and Admirall Ma|&s;ter <HI>Iacob Neck:</HI> Viceadmirall <HI>Wybrand van War|wick:</HI> and Rereadmirall <HI>Iacob Heemskerck.</HI></P>
<P>With this fleet of eight &s;hips we made &s;aile from Texell the fir&s;t of May 1598. <HI>Stilo Nouo,</HI> being the 21. of Aprill, after the account of England, and &s;ai|led with good &s;peed vnto the <HI>Cabo de bona &s;peranza:</HI> as further &s;hal appeare by a Iournal annexed vnto the end of this di&s;cour&s;e.</P>

Being pa&s;t the Cape, the 7. and 8. of Augu&s;t, by a &s;tonne of weather fiue &s;hips were &s;eparated from the Admirall, who afterwardes came together a|gaine before Bantam.</P>
<P>The 26. of Augu&s;t with three &s;hippes wee came within the view of Madaga&s;car, and the 29 wee <NOTE PLACE="marg">They meete with a &s;hip of Zeland.</NOTE> met with a &s;hip of Zeeland called the Long-barke, which had put to &s;ea before vs, and now kept aloofe from vs, &s;uppo&s;ing we were enemies: but at length perceiuing by our flagges what we were, they &s;ent their Pinnas aboord vs, reioycing greatly to haue met with vs, becau&s;e that diuers of their men were &s;icke, and ten were already dead: and they had in all but &s;euen men aboord the &s;hippe that were meat|whole, and eleuen marriners to guide the &s;hippe. Wee agreed to relieue them with &s;ome &s;upplie of men: but through darkene&s;&s;e and great winde wee lo&s;t them againe.</P>
<P>After this, we the Admiral Mauritius, the Hol|landia, &amp; the pinnas Ouerii&s;&s;ell keeping together, came to the I&s;land of Santa Maria, before the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The I&s;le of Santa Maria.</NOTE> great bay of Antogil in Madaga&s;car: where wee got a &s;mall quantity of Rice. We tooke the King pri&s;oner, who paide for his Ran&s;ome a Cow and a fat calfe.</P>
<P>In this I&s;land we found no great commodity: for being the month of September, the &s;ea&s;on was not for any fruits: the Oranges had but flowers: Le|mons were &s;cant: of Sugar-canes and Hens there was &s;ome &s;tore, but the Inhabitants were not very forward in bringing them out.</P>
<P>Heere wee &s;awe the hunting of the Whale (a &s;trange pa&s;time) certaine Indians in a Canoa, or <NOTE PLACE="marg">Killing of the Whale.</NOTE> boate following a great Whale, and with a har|ping Iron, which they ca&s;t forth, piercing the whals body, which yron was fa&s;tned to a long rope made of
<PB N="4" REF="6">
the barkes of trees, and &s;o tied fa&s;t to their Canoa. All this while pricking and wounding the Whale &s;o much as they could, they made him furiou&s;ly to &s;triue too and fro, &s;wiftly &s;wimming in the &s;ea, pluc|king the canoa after him: &s;ometimes to&s;&s;ing it vp and downe, as lightly as if it had been a &s;trawe: the Indians in the meane time being cunning &s;wim|mers taking &s;mall care though they were ca&s;t ouer|boord, tooke fa&s;t hold by the boat &s;til, and &s;o after &s;ome continuance of this &s;port the whale wearied &amp; wa|xing faint, and &s;taining the &s;ea red with his bloud, they haled him toward the &s;hore, and when they had gotten him &s;o neare &s;hore on the &s;hallowe that the mo&s;t part of him appeared aboue water, they drew him aland and he wed him in pieces, euery one ta|king thereof what plea&s;ed them, which was to vs a &s;trange &s;ight. It is reported that the Indians of Terra Florida v&s;e the like fi&s;hing for the Whale. Our men might haue taken &s;ome part thereof, but refu&s;ed it: the pieces therof were &s;o like larde or fat bacon.</P>
<P>From thence we made toward the great Bay of <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bay of Antogill.</NOTE> Antogill and ancored vnder the I&s;land, where wee tooke in fre&s;h water.</P>
<P>Our Indians that were brought from thence by them of the former voiage (the names of whome were <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> the one, and the other <HI>Laurence)</HI> wee offered to &s;et there on land, but they refu&s;ed, chu&s;ing rather to tarry with vs and to be apparel|led, then to go naked in their owne countrey: wor|king and moyling for a mi&s;erable liuing, oppo&s;ing their bare &s;kins to the vehemency of the &s;unne and weather: and their excu&s;e was, that in that place they were &s;trangers and had none acquaintance. <NOTE PLACE="marg">How long their beere continued good.</NOTE></P>
<P>Our beere continued good vntill we were pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Cape de bona &s;peranza.</HI> From thence we began to
<PB N="5" REF="6">
mingle it with water hauing a portion of wine al|lowed vs twi&s;e a day, and this allowance continued vntill our returne into Holland.</P>
<P>We went with our boates vp the riuer &s;eeking refre&s;hing: but the Inhabitants gaue vs to vnder|&s;tand by &s;ignes that wee might returne, for there was nothing to be had. Wee rowed into the riuer about three leagues, and found their report to bee true. The cau&s;e was, that the Kings made warre there one again&s;t an other, and &s;o all the victuals were in manner de&s;troied, in&s;omuch that the In|habitants them&s;elues many of them peri&s;hed for hunger, and in one of the&s;e battailes one of their Kings was lately &s;laine. Wherfore after fiue daies abode and no longer, we departed, &amp; in Gods name made to &s;ea again, directing our cour&s;e the &s;ixteenth of September for Iaua. About the ninteenth of Nouember we came within &s;ight of Sumatra, and the 26. of the &s;ame moneth 1598. wee in the three &s;hippes afore&s;aid, to wit, the Mauritius our Ad|mirall, the Hollandia, and the Oueri&s;&s;ell, arriued <NOTE PLACE="marg">They arriue at Bantam.</NOTE> befo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">e the citty of Bantam in Iaua. Pre&s;ently vp|on this our arriuall, our Admirall and Generall Ma&s;ter <HI>Iacob van Neck,</HI> &s;ought with all friend&s;hip to traffique with the people of the &s;aide towne of Bantam, &s;ending Ma&s;ter <HI>Cornelis Heemskerck</HI> on land to &s;hew them what we were, for they thought vs to be the very &s;ame men that had been there the yeare before, and al that while guarded the &s;ea-co&s;t, as being a&s;&s;uredly per&s;uaded that we were pirates and &s;ea rouers. But we, to make them vnder&s;tand the contrary, &s;ent on lande one <HI>Abdoll</HI> of China a captiue of theirs, whom we brought from them in our fir&s;t voyage; by who&s;e meanes we got audience <NOTE PLACE="marg">They pre&s;ent their letters and gifts.</NOTE> and credite: and &s;o we pre&s;ented our gifts and pre|&s;ents to the King, which was but a childe: and the
<PB N="6" REF="7">
chiefe gouernour called <HI>Cephat,</HI> hauing the kingly authority, mo&s;t thankfully receiued the &s;ame in the name of his King. The &s;aid pre&s;ents were a faire couered cup of &s;iluer and gilt, certaine veluets and clothes of &s;ilke, with very fine drinking gla&s;&s;es and excellent looking gla&s;&s;es, and &s;uch other gifts more. Likewi&s;e we pre&s;ented our letters &s;ealed very co&s;tly with the great &s;eale of the noble &amp; mighty lords the E&s;tates generall of the vnited Prouinces, and of prince <HI>Mauritz,</HI> whome they termed their Prince. Which letters were by them receiued with great reuerence, creeping vpon their knees: and (the &s;ame being well peru&s;ed, read, and examined) they found thereby our hone&s;t intent and determination for traffike: in&s;omuch that a mutuall league of friend|&s;hip and alliance was concluded, and we were freely licen&s;ed to trade and traffike in &s;uch wi&s;e, that euen <NOTE PLACE="marg">Trade licen&s;ed</NOTE> the fourth day of our arriual we began to lade; and within foure or fiue weekes all our foure &s;hips ha|uing taken in their full fraight, were ready to de|part.</P>
<P>When our three &s;hippes afore&s;aid had remained there welnigh a moneth, about Newyear&s;-tide ar|riued the other fiue &s;hippes of our company before mentioned in very good manner, and well conditio|ned. And &s;o our whole fleete of eight &s;hips ioyfully <NOTE PLACE="marg">The whole fleet meet be|fore Bantam.</NOTE> met together, and had none or very fewe &s;icke per|&s;ons among them, hauing lo&s;t by death in the whole fleete but 35 men in all, of which number &s;ome pe|ri&s;hed through their owne negligence. Vpon this happy meeting wee di&s;plaied our flags, &s;treamers, and en&s;ignes after the braue&s;t manner, honouring and greeting one one another with volleies of &s;hot, making good cheere, and (which was no &s;mall mat|ter) growing more deeply in fauour with the town&s;|men of Bantam. Vnto vs were daily brought a|boord
<PB N="7" REF="7">
in Prauwes or Indian boats great quantity of hens, egs, Cocos, bonanes, &s;ugar-canes, cakes made of rice, and a certaine kinde of good drinke which is there made by the men of China. Thus the people daily bartered with vs for pewter and other wares, giuing &s;o much virtuals for a pewter &s;poone, as might well &s;uffice one man for an whole weeke. Wee trucked likewi&s;e for diuers other things, as for porcellan di&s;hes and &s;uch like. How|be it that which our Indian <HI>Abdoll</HI> declared (name|ly, that more &s;hips were comming be&s;ides the three afore&s;aid, and that others be&s;ide them al&s;o were &s;ent out of Zeland) little tended to our commodity: for thereupon the Iauans tooke occa&s;ion to inhan&s;e <NOTE PLACE="marg">The price of pepperinhan|&s;ed.</NOTE> the price of their pepper; in&s;omuch that we were forced to pay for 55 pounds of pepper fir&s;t three, and afterward foure Reals of eight: neither did they demaund or call for any thing &s;o much as for the &s;aid Reals of eight. Mercery or haberda&s;hers wares were in no &s;uch reque&s;t as money. Al&s;o we much marueiled how the Iauans &s;hould tell vs of more &s;hippes to come, making &s;ignes with their foure fingers and thumb, that foure Lyma (which word in their language &s;ignifieth &s;hippes) were com|ming.</P>
<P>And here you are to vnder&s;tand, that our Gene|rall Ma&s;ter <HI>Van Neck,</HI> together with the commi&s;|&s;aries or factors, thought good, be&s;ides the three for|&s;aid <NOTE PLACE="marg">Foure &s;hips laden.</NOTE> &s;hips that came fir&s;t, to lade one other, to wit, the greater pinna&s;&s;e called Fri&s;land, whereof was Ma&s;ter <HI>Iacob Corneli&s;on,</HI> and Factor <HI>Walter Wille|kens.</HI> The&s;e foure &s;hippes hauing receiued their ful fraight, and giuen notice on land of their departure (to the end that none of their creditours might bee vnpaid) and al&s;o hauing well prouided them&s;elues of rice and water, departed the thirteenth of Ianu|ary
<PB N="8" REF="8">
1599. and &s;ayled to Sumatra, where they tooke <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their depar|ture from Iaua the 13. of Ia|nuary 1599.</NOTE> in fre&s;h water; for that the water of Bantam fir&s;t waxeth white, and afterward crawleth full of ma|gots.</P>
<P>Upon the land of Sumatra we bartered kniues, &s;poones, looking-gla&s;&s;es, bels, needles and &s;uch like, for &s;undry fruits, to wit, melons, cucumbers, oni|ons, garlike, and pepper though little in quantity, yet exceeding good.</P>
<P>We had to deale with a notable Merchant of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sa&s;emolonke a notable mar|chant of Ban|tam.</NOTE> Bantam, named <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;emolonke,</HI> who&s;e father was a Ca&s;tilian, which &s;old vs not much le&s;&s;e then an hun|dreth la&s;t of pepper&punc; He was mo&s;t de&s;irous to haue traueiled with vs into Holland: but mi&s;doubting the di&s;plea&s;ure and euil will or the king, and fearing lea&s;t his goods might haue bin confi&s;cated, he dur&s;t not aduenture vpon the voiage.</P>
<P>Certaine daies before our departure from Ban|tam were the other foure &s;hippes di&s;patched to go <NOTE PLACE="marg">The four other &s;hips &s;ent to the Moluccas.</NOTE> for the Moluccas, and ouer them was appointed as Admirall and Generall Ma&s;ter <HI>Wybrant van Warwicke</HI> in the &s;hippe called Am&s;terdam, &amp; <HI>Iacob Heemskerck</HI> Viceadmirall in the &s;hippe Gelderland, the other two &s;hippes in con&s;ort with them being Zeland and Vtrecht before mentioned</P>
<P>The&s;e foure made &s;aile towards the Moluccas, and parted from vs the 8. of Ianuary in the night, and in taking of our leaues both of vs together, made &s;uch a terrible thundering noi&s;e with our or|dinance, that the town&s;emen were vp in Alarme, vntill they knewe the rea&s;on thereof. The people were glad of their departure, hauing &s;ome mi&s;tru&s;t of vs, remaining there &s;o &s;trong with 8. &s;hips. And they a&s;ked daily when wee &s;hould depart, making great &s;peed to help vs vnto our lading, and &s;hewing them&s;elues mo&s;t &s;eruiceable vnto vs.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="8">
The 11 of Ianuary 1599. we in the foure &s;hippes laden with pepper departed from Bantam home|ward. The 13 we arriued at Sumatra. The 19 we &s;haped our cour&s;e directly for Holland. The 3 of April we had &s;ight of <HI>Capo de buona e&s;peranza.</HI> The 8 of Aprill we doubled the &s;aid Cape, proceeding on for the I&s;le of Saint Helena, whither we came the twenty &s;ixt of the &s;ame moneth, and there refre&s;hed our &s;elues for the &s;pace of eight daies.</P>
<P>In this I&s;land we found a church with certaine boothes or tents in it, and the image of Saint He|lena, as likewi&s;e a holy water-fat, and a &s;prinkle to ca&s;t or &s;prinkle y^e holy water: but we left all things in as good order as we found them.</P>
<P>More ouer here we left behinde vs &s;ome remem|brances in writing, in token of our being there. At this place died of the bloudy flixe, the Pilot of our Admirall <HI>Kees Collen</HI> of Munickendam, a worthy man, to our great griefe.</P>
<P>This I&s;land (as <HI>Iohn Huighen van Lin&s;chotten</HI> de&s;cribeth it) is repleni&s;hed with manifold commo|dities, as namely with goates, wilde &s;wine, Tur|kies, partriges, pidgeons, &amp;c. But by rea&s;on that tho&s;e which arriue there v&s;e to di&s;charge their or|dinance, and to hunt and pur&s;ue the &s;aide bea&s;tes and fowles, they are now growen exceeding wilde and hard to be come by. Certaine goates whereat we &s;hotte fled vp to the high cliffes, &s;o that it was impo&s;&s;ible to get them. Likewi&s;e fi&s;hes wee could not catch &s;o many as wee needed; but wee tooke in fre&s;h water enough to &s;erue vs till our arriuall in Holland.</P>
<P>Here we left on land as a man bani&s;hed out of our <NOTE PLACE="marg">A man left on land at Saint Helena.</NOTE> &s;ociety, one <HI>Peter Gisbrecht</HI> the ma&s;ters mate of the great pinna&s;&s;e, becau&s;e hee had &s;troken the Ma|&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="9">
Very penitent hee was and &s;orie for his mi&s;de|meauour, and all of vs did our be&s;t endeuour to ob|tain his pardon: but (the orders &amp; ordinances wher|eunto our whole company was &s;worne being read before vs) we were con&s;trained to &s;urcea&s;e our im|portunate &s;uit, and he for the example of others to vndergo the &s;euere doome that was allotted him.</P>
<P>There was deliuered vnto him a certaine quan|tity of bread, oile, and rice, with hookes and in&s;tru|ments to fi&s;h withall, as al&s;o a hand gun and gun|poulder.</P>
<P>Hereupon we bad him generally farewell, be&s;ee|ching God to keepe and pre&s;erue him from mi&s;for|tunes, and hoping that at &s;ome one time or other he &s;hould finde deliuerance; for that all &s;hippes &s;ai|ling to the We&s;t Indies mu&s;t there of nece&s;&s;ity re|fre&s;h them&s;elues.</P>
<P>Not far from this place we de&s;cried a &s;aile which wee iudged to be &s;ome Frenchman, by whom per|aduenture the &s;aide bani&s;hed party might bee de|liuered.</P>
<P>The fourth of May we &s;et &s;aile from Saint He|lena, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The I&s;le of A&s;cen&s;ion.</NOTE> and the tenth of the &s;ame moneth wee pa&s;&s;ed by the I&s;le of A&s;cen&s;ion. The 17 day wee pa&s;&s;ed the line. The 21 we &s;awe the Pole-&s;tarre. The 10 and 11 of Iune we had &s;ight of the Canaries. About the Azores wee &s;tood in feare to meete with &s;ome &s;pani&s;h Armada, becau&s;e our men were growen faint and feeble by rea&s;on of their long voi|age. The 27 of Iune we entered the Spani&s;h &s;ea. The 29 we found our &s;elues to be in fortie foure de|grees of northerly latitude. The 6 of Iuly our Ad|mirall y^e Mauritius had two of his ma&s;tes blowne ouerboord; for which cau&s;e we were con&s;trained to towe him along. The 11 of Iuly wee pa&s;&s;ed the Sorlings. The 13 we &s;ayled by Falmouth, Dart|mouth
<PB N="11" REF="9">
and the Qua&s;quets. The 17 we pa&s;&s;ed by Douer. The 19 meeting with &s;ome &s;tormes and rainy weather we arriued at Texell in our owne natiue countrey, without any great mi&s;fortune, &s;aue that the Mauritius once &s;troke on ground.</P>
<P>Thus hauing attained to our wi&s;hed home, we gaue God thankes for this our &s;o happy and pro&s;|perous voiage: becau&s;e there neuer arriued in Hol|land any &s;hippes &s;o richly laden.</P>
<P>Of pepper we brought eight hundreth tunnes, of <NOTE PLACE="marg">The particu|lars of their rich lading.</NOTE> Cloues two hundreth, be&s;ides great quantity of Mace, Nutmegs, Cinamom, and other principall commodities.

<P>We were &s;ailing outward from Texell to Ban|tam &s;euen moneths, we remained there &s;ixe weekes to take in our lading, and in &s;ix moneths we retur|ned from Bantam in Iaua to Holland.</P>

<P>Where during that &s;pace (being a man of good ob|&s;eruation and experience, and borne about Chi|na) hee was well entreated, cheri&s;hed, and much made of.</P>

This <HI>Abdoll</HI> vpon his returne to Iaua being de|manded <NOTE PLACE="marg">The relation of Abdoll an Indian, con|cerning the Netherlands.</NOTE> concerning the &s;tate of the Netherlands, made vnto the principall men of Bantam a full de|claration thereof, with all the rarities and &s;ingu|larities which he had there &s;eene and ob&s;erued.</P>
<P>Which albeit to the greate&s;t part of readers, who haue trauailed tho&s;e countries may &s;eeme nothing &s;trange, and &s;carce worthy the relation: yet becau&s;e the report was made by &s;o meere a &s;tranger, &amp; with the Iauans that heard it wrought &s;o good effect, I thought it not altogether impertinent here in this place to make rehear&s;all thereof.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t therefore he tolde them (to their great ad|miration in that hoat climate) That hee had &s;eene aboue a thou&s;and &s;leds drawen, and great num|bers of hor&s;emen riding vpon the frozen water in winter time, and that he had beheld more then two hundreth thou&s;and people trauailing on foote and on hor&s;eback vpon the yce, as likewi&s;e that the &s;aid &s;leds were by hor&s;es drawen &s;o &s;wiftly, that they made more way in three houres than any man could go on foote in tenne.

<P>Howbeit they would hardly be induced to beleeue that tho&s;e countries &s;hould be &s;o extreamely colde, and the waters &s;o mightely frozen, as to beare &s;uch an huge waight.</P>
<P>Hee tolde them moreouer, that Holland was a free countrey, and that euery man there was his owne Ma&s;ter, and that there was not one &s;laue or captiue in the whole land.</P>
<P>Moreouer, that the hou&s;es, in regarde of their beautifull and lofty building, re&s;embled &s;tately pal|laces, their inward rich furniture being altogether an&s;werable to their outward glorious &s;hew.</P>

<P>He affirmed likewi&s;e, that the Hollanders with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their confederates and friendes, maintained warres again&s;t the King of Spaine, who&s;e mighty pui&s;&s;ance is feared and redoubted of all the potentates of Europa.</P>
<P>And albeit the &s;aid warres had continued aboue thirty yeares, yet that during all that time the &s;aide Hollanders increa&s;ed both in might &amp; wealth.</P>
<P>In like &s;ort he informed them of the &s;trange &s;itu|ation of Holland, as being a countrey driuing vpon the water, the earth or ground whereof, they v&s;e in&s;teed of fewell, and that he had oft times warmed him&s;elfe, and had &s;eene meat dre&s;&s;ed with fires made of the &s;ame earth.</P>

<P>The Generall of them that came from Goa was <HI>Don Luis,</HI> and of tho&s;e that came from Molucca <HI>Don Emanuell:</HI> who brought their Armada before Bantam, intending to &s;urprize the citty, vnder pre|tence that the &s;ame preparation was made to re&s;i&s;t certaine pirates that came thither out of Holland the la&s;t yeare, and were determined this yeare al&s;o to come againe. Vnder the&s;e colours they &s;ought to take the towne and to fortifie the &s;ame, &amp; they built certaine &s;conces in the countrey, committing great outrages, raui&s;hing the Women, with many other villanies. Hereupon the town&s;emen of Bantam ve|ry &s;ecretly prouided certaine gallies and fu&s;tes in great ha&s;t, and &s;odainly a&s;&s;ailed the Portugales before they were well aware of them: for which cau&s;e finding but &s;mall re&s;i&s;tance, they tooke 3 Por|tugale gallies with certaine &s;hippes, and &s;lewe a|bout <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Portugals vanqui&s;hed.</NOTE> 300 of them, taking 150 Portugales pri&s;o|ners, of which we daily &s;aw &s;ome going vp &amp; downe the &s;treetes of Bantam like &s;laues and captiues.

Here they entered into an hauen, calling the &s;ame <HI>Warwicke,</HI> after the name of their Viceadmirall, wherin they found very good harborow in twenty degrees of &s;ou|therly latitude.</P>
<P>This I&s;land being &s;ituate to the Ea&s;t of Mada|ga&s;car, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The I&s;le of Mauritius de|&s;cribed.</NOTE> and containing as much in compa&s;&s;e as all Holland, is a very high, goodly, and plea&s;ant land, full of green &amp; fruitfull vallies, and repleni&s;hed with Palmito-trees, from the which droppeth hole&s;ome wine.

<P>Of the &s;aide Pidgeons and Popiniayes they found great plenty being very fat and good meate, which they could ea&s;ily take and kil euen with little &s;tickes: &s;o tame they are by rea&s;on y^t the I&s;le is not inhabited, neither be the liuing creatures therein accu&s;tomed to the &s;ight of men.</P>

<P>Here was founde waxe al&s;o whiter then any of ours, lying about the &s;trande, bleached (as it is like) by the &s;unne: and in &s;ome of this waxe there were Arabian letters or characters printed: wher|by it is probable, that &s;ome Arabian &s;hip might bee ca&s;t away thereabout, out of which the &s;aid waxe might be driuen on land.</P>
