<HEAD>THE City of BATH DESCRIBED.</HEAD>
<P>_THe City of <HI>Bath</HI> is &s;eated in the North North-Ea&s;t part of <HI>Somer&s;et|&s;hire,</HI> environ'd (almo&s;t) all) round with plea&s;ant and fruitful Hills full of excellent Springs of Waters, in &s;o much as 'tis ob&s;erved that on many of their Sumits, there are rare Chri&s;tal Waters, gu&s;hing out e&s;pecially in one Village adjoyning to the Southwards of it, there are near Fifty (if not more) Habitations, where &s;carce one Hou&s;e makes u&s;e of that Water that &s;erved another, each one enjoying a parti|cular to its &s;elf.</P>
<P>The Valley in which it &s;tands, in any place extends (hardly) it &s;elf to half a Mile in bredth, in mo&s;t places le&s;s; it is very plea&s;ant and fruitful, and therein hardly ever &s;een any Pools, Loughs, or Meery places; for as &s;oon as any inundation is over, the Waters totally Drein away

with it, which doubtle&s;s contributes much to the Salu|brity of the Air. From two of the&s;e Hills, the City (by Pipes of Lead) is not only plentifully &s;erved into the Common Conduits, but al&s;o not few of the private Hou&s;es are &s;upplyed with it within their own Doors, &s;uch a Convenience, and at &s;uch ea&s;ie Rates, that few places enjoy the like; and this being carried through mo&s;t Streets, Lanes, and By-wayes, is not only for within|door Occa&s;ions, but in ca&s;e of Fire, is very ready to be made u&s;e of.</P>
<P>The Streets, mo&s;t of the Narrowe&s;t &s;ize, e&s;pecially that near the Center called <HI>Cheap-&s;treet,</HI> the greate&s;t Eye|&s;ore of its Beauty and Cumber to its accommodation, it is Walled all round, with a Time-defying Stone, the Buildings (by &s;trong &s;uppo&s;ition) mounted much higher then in former Ages; for walking round the Walls, it is perceivable, the City &s;tands on a Batch (as we call it) in a bottom, from Fifteen to Twenty foot higher then the Surface without; neither is it without Suburbs, the fourth part &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;o, and all together, com|puted by &s;ome that pretend to have calculated its Di|men&s;ions, takes not up much more then Fifty Acres, in &s;uch a narrow compa&s;s is this ancient, famous, little pretty City contained; which being in &s;uch a bottom, hath &s;uch a variety of Pro&s;pects, and Landskips, that few places parallel it, whereas places &s;cited on Levels, &s;eldom plea&s;e the Eye far, deprived by the interpo&s;ition of the next Pale, Wall, or Hedge, whereas, this rai&s;ing it &s;elf higher then the adjoyning Gardens and Meadows, hath full and free pa&s;&s;age, nor do the Hills &s;o &s;trengthen the Pro&s;pect, but that the Eye may even &s;urfeit its &s;elf with variety of Objects (in &s;ome places) for at lea&s;t three Miles, at once beholding the <HI>Meander-Aven</HI> Semi-circling the City, then the low Meadows, in &s;everal

&s;mall and great Partitions, the Pa&s;ture grounds above them, then the Corn fields, &s;o gradually ye come up to the Downs, on which particularly <HI>Laun&s;down</HI> is an excellent Coar&s;e of above two Miles, at the end whereof may be &s;een the City of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> with the Counties of <HI>Somer&s;et, Wilts, Gloce&s;ter, Worce&s;ter, Hereford,</HI> and <HI>Men|mouth;</HI> but this has made me endanger the Out-running my intended Di&s;cour&s;e, &s;eldom farther then the little City or its Pro&s;pect, but this Digre&s;&s;ion (I &s;uppo&s;e) may not be much out of Order, when the Gallantry and Youth of the Nation, may be made acquainted, what Recrea|tion the Vicinity of the place affords, e&s;pecially when it is accompanied with Hunting, Setting, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Wall is in compa&s;s not a full <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mile, and were the City not in &s;uch a bottom, and &s;o over topped by Neighbouring Hills, by the Opinion of Col. <HI>B.</HI> (once Governor thereof) and &s;ome others, that may under|&s;tand Fortifications) might be made Tenable, for indeed the whole, is but one entire Rampart, a Coffin fill'd with Earth, on which the Buildings are; then the Springs &s;o near the Superficies, that no Approaches can be made but with great difficulty, there are large di&s;cour&s;es already extant of &s;everal Statues, Figures, as Gorgons Ser|pents, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in it, in which I &s;hall not meddle, but leave every man to his view, and belief, but certainly this, it is a Noble Ancient Wall therein appearing many antiquities, as al&s;o four Gates, having their &s;everal denominations from the four Cardinal winds, which every night are or|der'd to be lock'd up, and a Watch Itinerant, Sworn not to enter any Hou&s;e till four in the Morn, which how duely ob&s;erved, &s;ome of them who have been caught tardy, and put into Wooden Ba&s;tile, for their pains can &s;atisfie you.</P>
<P>The Government is by a Mayor, Aldermen, and Twenty Councellors or Citizens. The Mayor and Alder|men
<PB N="4" REF="6">
(on &s;olemn dayes) are in Scarlet, the number (by Charter) may not exceed eleven, nor under five; to the&s;e is added a Recorder, who there with the Mayor is Ju&s;tice of the Peace and <HI>Quorum,</HI> having the precedence of the two other Ju&s;tices; al&s;o a Town Clark, who every Leet-day (twice in the year) calls the Court, and it is kept in his Name, although Mayor, Aldermen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>And here (I conceive it will not be improper, no Sally from the purpo&s;e, to ob&s;erve the care here taken for the Poor, of which quality (I &s;uppo&s;e) there are fewer then in any place (for its bigne&s;s) in the Kingdom, the yearly rate for the three Pari&s;hes, being under 30 <HI>l. per ann.</HI> which to &s;ome Strangers, hath, not being acquainted with the Cu&s;tom and Method here taken) &s;eem'd wonderful, mo&s;t People conjecturing the City to be poor, (as indeed it cannot vaunt of many notoriou&s;ly rich) yet Providence, with the beneficent munificence of &s;ome of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Monarques hath &s;ufficiently provided for it, thereby they owing as little to their backs and bellies as any place I know of, yet no &s;tupid Gormandizers neither; for &s;uch care is taken that the wealthier &s;ort eat their own Mor|&s;els, free from &s;uch importunate Clamours and Out|cries as are too frequently &s;een in other places, that have a higher Celebration for Riches, this principally ari&s;ing (without doubt) from Magi&s;tratical care, at every Quar|ter-Sale day wherein the poorer &s;ort are not only kindly u&s;ed (beyond compari&s;on) but are al&s;o &s;o tyed up, that they cannot &s;quander away their good bargains, but are re&s;erved in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity to their needy Families.</P>
<P>It is &s;upplied and adorned for the Service of God with three Churches, dedicated to St. <HI>James,</HI> St. <HI>Michael,</HI> and St. <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul,</HI> the later ju&s;tly challenging to its &s;elf the preheminence, for light&s;omne&s;s, &s;tateline&s;s, and ele|gance

The Tenor is called <HI>Hopton;</HI> mo&s;tly the gift of that Honorable Family, what wanted in their bounty, was &s;upplyed by the City; to this Tower are four &s;everal Stair-Ca&s;es, at each di&s;tinct corner one. This Stately Pile was begun in <HI>Henry</HI> the Sevenths time by one <HI>Oliver King,</HI> the then Bi&s;hop of the Dioce&s;s, but never (by the iniquity of the times partly ari&s;ing by the &s;everal changes) could it ari&s;e to any perfection, till about the year 1606. God rai&s;ed up Bi&s;hop <HI>Montague,</HI> Mr. <HI>Thomas Bellot,</HI> and other pious and generous Benefactors, by who&s;e great bounty and good Example it now enjoys its pre&s;ent Splendor and Glory. In the Body whereof one thing is mo&s;t remarkable, that although it be of a va&s;t Dimen&s;ion taking its height, bredth, and length, and lying unco|vered for above 100 years, the Windows &s;o large, the Walls &s;o thin, (that I pre&s;ume many Man&s;ion-hou&s;es equal it) yet this Noble Pile, notwith&s;tanding it hath no &s;loaping Buttre&s;&s;es, on the out&s;ide to &s;upport and &s;treng|then it, which the great Churches u&s;ually have, &s;hews no Flaw, Crack, not &s;ettling, but &s;tands firm and en|tire, evidencing thereby, not only the profound Skill of the Architect, but the goodne&s;s of the Stone, who&s;e quality is, when taken up green out of the Quarry, of &s;uch a &s;oftne&s;s, that a Pen-knife (comparatively) may work it, without turning its edge, but when expo&s;ed to any building in the open Air, nothing more la&s;ting, nothing more permanent, for neither Age nor time can deface it, witne&s;s the whole Pile, which notwith&s;tanding it hath &s;tood near two Centuries, yet to this day, remains as

<P>In the South-ea&s;t I&s;le, is a pretty, &s;omewhat &s;tately, and doubt le&s;s conceited Monument, all of Free-&s;tone, having Originally no In&s;cription, as to time, per&s;on, or quality, therefore vulgarly called the <HI>Speechle&s;s Monu|ment,</HI> but now not &s;o, for although the Tenant was (po&s;&s;ibly) not willing to have any, yet the will of the Dead, as to that particular is &s;ufficiently broken, for on the ground are many Stones, curiou&s;ly and artificially Joyned together, the&s;e make the re&s;emblance of a copped Che&s;t, and is in length, bredth, and height, &s;ufficient to receive an Ordinary Corps; but it &s;eems it was not the receptacle, if you believe the Scribled In&s;cription.</P>

<P>I mu&s;t not omit &s;peaking &s;omewhat of the Revenue of this Church, which indeed is but &s;mall, and that which is and hath been the Gifts of Prote&s;tant Benefactors, among whom, Dame <HI>Elizabeth Booth</HI> the Ance&s;tors of that Noble and fully accompli&s;h'd Gentleman the Lord <HI>de la&punc; Mere,</HI> exceeded all the Sons and Daughters of our <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> by who&s;e pious bounty (with &s;ome additions the
<PB N="9" REF="8">
City made) there is purcha&s;ed in Land, to the yearly value of near 20 l. <HI>per annum,</HI> this &s;eems but a &s;mall main|tenance for &s;o great a Building, yet with this, and with what el&s;e doth ari&s;e by breaking ground for Burial places, and for Monuments, it is as well kept in Repair as any Church I know of.</P>
<P>But before I leave this Church, I &s;hall leave with you the&s;e few ob&s;ervations; Fir&s;t, that not any one (that I know of) not of the Religion profe&s;&s;ed and e&s;tabli&s;h'd, gave one peny towards its Reparation; Next for the ho|nour of our Fathers, they were the Repairers, and that in the la&s;t place We their Survivours may not be branded of having &s;o much Faith, that we have lo&s;t all Good Works, continue the Reparation, and that not Niggardly neither; of which tho&s;e famous Battlements and Pinacles, almo&s;t round, gives &s;ufficient and pregnant Evidence.</P>
<P>And now having done your Devotions, it is time I lead you to the Kings Bath, where as &s;oon as you come down the great Stairs, you may behold the Stone-pavement and Battlements quite round it, the bounty of Sir <HI>Francis Stonor</HI> of <HI>Stonor;</HI> and for that I have had &s;ome Reflections on Prote&s;tant Benefactors on the Church to give each Per&s;wa&s;ion its due, this Gentleman was a Romani&s;t, may not this therefore argue for them, that although they may be no Friends to the Church, yet they may be to the State&punc; And now behold one of the greate&s;t Mira|cles in Nature: The Univer&s;e (by Travellers general report) not affording the like, who&s;e Waters, (granted by all hands to be as old as the Creation, keeping con|&s;tantly one quantity and quality in the greate&s;t Drought, not one drop le&s;s in appearance, nor in the greate&s;t Flouds or Innundation any the More, experimentally made true by this unque&s;tionable Evidence, the Waters filling it up to the u&s;ual height, which when the Sluces are carefully
<PB N="10" REF="9">
and exactly &s;topped, whether Summer or Winter, Drought or Floud, makes not one Minutes difference; &s;o that Dame <HI>Luna,</HI> that Puling Pi&s;s-Kitchin Planet with her Ebbings and Flowings, her Nepes and Spring-tides, hath no influence at all here, and no more then Rea&s;on, for the&s;e Waters all along have been and are <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Anciently the Cities Name.</NOTE> <HI>Aquae Solis,</HI> &s;o <HI>Sol</HI> is &s;olely predominant here, and Lord Paramount, whereby we are a&s;&s;ured they partake of no other accidental Increa&s;e, by any Spring or &s;oaking to contaminate, defile or di&s;-vertue it, which the cold Waters of <HI>Tunbridge, Ep&s;om, Barnet,</HI> &amp;c. cannot appropriate to them&s;elves, if general report be true, they increa&s;ing and decrea&s;ing, according to Acci|dent and Sea&s;on; but of this no more till I come to hint, and but to hint of them in another place.</P>
<P>Now the quantity of the&s;e Waters ari&s;ing in the Kings Bath (there are none in the Queens although they are contiguous) may (as is &s;uppo&s;ed) very well drive an Over-&s;hot Mill, and the quality is as con&s;tant as the quan|tity, the Springs at their Ebullitions, as hot in <HI>December</HI> as in <HI>June,</HI> and therefore may (with &s;ome more care for prevention of taking Cold) be with much efficacy u&s;ed in all Sea&s;ons of the year, which is very fit &s;hould be taken notice of, to remove a Vulgar Error, That the&s;e Waters are never u&s;eful nor &s;ea&s;onable but in the Summer.</P>
<P>Among the many Springs in the Kings Bath, there is a principal one called the Hot-Spring, which is received by its &s;elf (without Communication into a lead Ci&s;tern, and that &s;o clo&s;e, that it is impo&s;&s;ible any Drop of the other Waters can intermingle, over this Spring and Ci&s;tern, is (by the Order and Direction of an Honorable and Famous Phy&s;itian, a pump erecting, &s;o that the Waters from its &s;ingle Effluence &s;hall by three &s;everal Convey|ances, be di&s;tributed abroad in wonderful quantities, in|&s;omuch,
