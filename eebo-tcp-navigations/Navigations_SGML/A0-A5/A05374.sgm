<HEAD>To his very friend E. B. e&s;quier affectio|nate friend and deuoti&s;te &s;eruaunt vn|to the fayre and vertuous Lady the Counte&s;&s;e of Cu|lenberghe.</HEAD>
<P>_THis olde prouerbe (as co~monly all other) hath his grou~d vpon knowe~ experience, <HI>Malus ani|mus, malamens,</HI> an euill affection maketh an e|uill construction. Men wrest or driue the interpretacio~ of doings to the frame of their owne coceits, which they deriue from the fauour or disfauour that they haue &s;ettled in their owne per&s;wa&s;ions. It is not vnknowen what extraordina|ry di&s;cour&s;es, &amp; what priuate fan&s;ies in common meeti~gs, are daily made of the ca&s;e of our neighbours in the low Coun|try. Such maner of debatinge where co~|trary opinio~s haue di&s;tracted you &s;eeme to be the cau&s;e of your question, wherof you de&s;ire to be re&s;olued in your letters.
<PB REF="4">You coulde not haue written to a man more indifferent than I am: who am as farre from parcialitie, as he that loueth, (that is to &s;ay preferreth) neither party before other, but our country before the~ both. I do therefore (as I wish you to doe) &s;et the pin of the beame eauen, and examine the weight of either &s;kale. Let vs then co~pare the &s;ides, and begin with the sharper, that we maye haue the mil|der ending.</P>
<P>First I will call to minde, what thone of tho&s;e &s;ides obiecteth:</P>
<P>Secondly what thother aun&s;wereth: And thirdly what to drawe to concerne our &s;elues.</P>
<P>In the matter of obiection, let vs &s;ee what &s;trength it hath in iustice:</P>
<P>In the matter of defence, let vs &s;ee what weight it hath in equitie:</P>
<P>And for the matter of Our &s;elues, let vs &s;ee what nece&s;&s;ity, what commodity, what right, and what facilitie it is &s;aid to beare, to draw vs to any &s;ide.</P>
<PB REF="4">
<P>It is &s;ayd by &s;ome, which are loth that Spaine should be weaker or Englande &s;tronger, that the Prince of Orendge &amp; his adhere~ts are rebels in Armes agai~&s;t their natural Prince, and maintayners of a most daungerous pre&s;ident again&s;t all Princes.</P>
<P>To this is aun&s;wered on thother part (as in this booke you shal &s;ee di&s;cour&s;ed) that there is difference of the bande &amp; maner of their &s;ubiection from other. None of them holdeth that a king maye be shaken of by his &s;ubiects: but they all &s;aye, that Lords electible vpon pacts &amp; conditions are al&s;o reiectible accordi~ge to the &s;ame pacts &amp; co~ditions, &s;pecial|ly in Dominions &s;ubiecte to the ciuill lawes, which are not the Lawes of Eng|land. The order of eche &s;tate is to be re|garded: not all States haue kings. Some haue other formes of gouernment. Not all kingdoms haue like maner of admi&s;|&s;ions or receyuings of kings. Som follow natural &s;ucce&s;sion of bloud: &s;ome Choi&s;e:
<PB REF="5">&s;ome Lot or chaunce. Some kings or ru|lers haue &s;imple &amp; ab&s;olute power: &s;ome limitted &amp; circum&s;cribed. Therles of Holland and Zealand (as is well knowe~ &amp; many examples haue proued, at their <HI>Ioyous entree</HI> that is to &s;aye, at ther re|ceyuinge to inauguration or &s;ei&s;en of their E&s;tate) be bound by oth to pre&s;cri|bed pacts &amp; orders: whereby not onelye their forme of rule is bounded, but al&s;o vpon diuers points the &s;ubiects homage &amp; allegiance expre&s;ly di&s;charged. And that di&s;charg in fact hath bin executed, &amp; by &s;uch fact, (&s;ay they,) the aunce&s;ters of the Prince him&s;elf that now chargeth them, haue bin receyued. The Prince and &s;tates of that Country alledge the othe of their Earle, the preci&s;e forme of a&s;&s;oylme~t vpon his breach of their Pri|uiledges: they produce one chiefe point, that they ought not to be pestered with gouernaunce or garri&s;on of &s;traungers: they recken vp thintollerable, outragi|ous &amp; manifest oppre&s;sions done vpon
<PB REF="5">them, and the euident practi&s;e to bring that free Nation to most vn&s;ufferable &s;eruitude: they shield them&s;elues vnder the liberty &amp; right of Nature, the pro|ui&s;ion of agreements, the othes of their Princes, their power of refu&s;all vppon their Princes periurie, wyth many like matters, whereof they make the worlde Iudges by their many Prote&s;tacions, A|pologies, Iustifications, &amp; Supplicatio~s to the &s;tates of thempyre, &amp; other mea|nes: alwayes &s;euering their ca&s;e from o|ther &s;ubiectes of Naturall and ab&s;olute Kinges.</P>
<P>FOR (&s;ay they) in their ca&s;e of re&s;i|&s;tinge the Kinge, the&s;e things are to be con&s;idered: the nature of the Gouerne|ment and &s;ubiection, &amp; the cau&s;e of re|&s;istance, and thirdly the maner of the re&s;istance. The nature of the Gouern|ment &amp; the &s;ubiection &s;ta~deth in the&s;e two con&s;iderations. VVhether it hee <HI>Merum Imperium,</HI> that all thinges may be done <HI>Pro voluntate Regnanti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">:</HI> or it be <HI>Mo|deratum,</HI>
<PB REF="6">which is <HI>Temperatu~ Legibus,</HI> where|in the Ruler hath his rule pre&s;cribed him which way to rule, &amp; the Subiect a Pa|terne de&s;cribed him which way to obey. If the Gouernment be <HI>Merum &amp; ab&s;olutu~,</HI> then is the Per&s;on inferiour, a &s;laue and no &s;ubiecte. For in all due &s;ubiection there is <HI>Taxis,</HI> which is neuer in <HI>Voluntate.</HI> If the Gouernmente be <HI>Temperatum,</HI> then is thinferiour a &s;ubiect and no &s;laue.</P>
<P>IN all &s;ubiection there is an hone&s;t liberty giuen by Law it &s;elf, whereby all Actions and Pleas in Lawe are as o|pen to the &s;ubiect as to the ruler, for the maintenaunce of truth and equitie. In &s;lauerie there is none &s;uch: becau&s;e he is not to be mea&s;ured but by the will of the Ruler, which how&s;oeuer it turneth, is his right: &amp; he hath no actio~ of Appeal or Plea to the contrary.</P>
<P>Then it followeth that the Law is the rightest Auctoritie, and the &s;ame is to be maintayned by all the iu&s;t and right|full executers of it: for if the Lawe
<PB REF="6">be not maynteined, the life of the whole common wealth is lost.</P>
<P>This mayntenaunce of the Lawe no man doubteth vvhether it ought to bee or no: for it is thende vvhy Coun&s;ellers &amp; vnder magi&s;trats are appoi~ted: yea it is the cau&s;e of placing the highe&s;t Magi|&s;trate hym&s;elfe. So that to maintayne the Lavv, is iudged meete by all men: if the Lavv be iust.</P>
<P>But whether the Law may be mayn|tayned agayn&s;t the Highe&s;t Magi&s;trate or no, that is the doubt. For here upo~ this maintenance of Law is called re&s;i&s;ta~ce, and is called Rebellion?</P>
<P>This question doth imply a contradi|ction: for it importeth that thone is a|gayn&s;t thother, &amp; no man can &s;erue two Maisters: &amp; &s;o &s;ta~deth the vvhole ca&s;e in the righteou&s;nes of the Lavv, which for the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e is pre&s;umed to be most iust &amp; most holy. VVhy then? The Per&s;on that is agaynst this Lavv, goeth aboute to di&s;anull that that is
<PB REF="7">most iu&s;t and mo&s;t holy, &amp; laboureth to bring in that, that is mo&s;t vniust, most vnholy. For touchinge his owne per&s;on the que&s;tion and debate &s;tandeth not, but for thinforcing of the &s;ubiects to the &s;ame.</P>
<P>VVHY then, there is no doubt but as it is confe&s;&s;ed of all me~, both that ne|uer knew God, and of them that do pro|fe&s;&s;e God, that iu&s;tice is to be maintay|ned again&s;t iniu&s;tice, Godlines against vngodlines, &amp; God against the deuill: els were the law no law, neither the &s;ub|iect a &s;ubiect: being (as I &s;ayd before) a per&s;on licenced to liue in liberty of law.</P>
<P>Thus by the nature of Gouernment &amp; the &s;ubiection, it is euidente that the righte&s;t Magi&s;trate may be re&s;i&s;ted, &amp; this re&s;i&s;tance is truly a maintenaunce of Law &amp; equitie and &s;o to be termed, and vntruly and vniustly called Rebel|lion. For the&s;e words of rebellion and &s;uche like cannot iustlye bee v&s;ed, but where the wyll of the Ruler and the law
<PB REF="7">are concurrent and agree in one.</P>
<P>By this that hath bin &s;aide of the Go|uernment it &s;elfe, en&s;ueth a right aun|&s;were to the cau&s;e of re&s;ista~ce. Nothing may cau&s;e re&s;istance to the Magistrate but the maintenaunce of righte and e|quitie: for there is no equitie in this, that the will of the &s;ubiect should &s;tand for a lawe to the Prince, where the &s;ub|iect thinketh it vnmeete that the wil of his Prince should &s;tande for a law of his &s;ubiection. This is again&s;t Iustice di|&s;tributiue, which the Heathen teach in their common wealth, &amp; flatly against the rule of GOD: <HI>Thou &s;halte not do to thy Neighbour y^t thou vvilt not haue don to thy &s;elfe.</HI></P>
<P>SO then he that hath law &amp; main|taineth the law, is re&s;i&s;ted on which part &s;oeuer he be: &amp; he that re&s;isteth the law is a rebell and traitour who&s;oeuer he be: for the law is <HI>y^e</HI> life of the co~mon weale. And the con&s;ideration of re&s;i&s;tance &s;ta~|deth not in the per&s;on, vnle&s;&s;e hee haue the law with him: if he be not <HI>Lex loque~s,</HI>
<PB REF="8">he is not re&s;isted, but re&s;isteth.</P>
<P>But euery man may not re&s;ist. They onely that are made keepers of the La|wes, to the~ it belo~geth: otherwy&s;e there would be a confu&s;io~, and euery man en|croche vpon an others office. The shed|ding of bloude is murther in euery pri|uate man: but if a Magistrate do it, he doth it lawfully, and is excu&s;ed before man, and doth his dutie to God: For hee beareth not the &s;word in vaine.</P>
<P>IN &s;um, where the kind of Gouern|ment is tempered by Law, &amp; the Prince hath a&s;well to liue by law as the &s;ubiect: if the Prince wil breake this Law which is iust, &amp; enforce an obedience to a law vniu&s;t against the will of the Subiects: the law may be maintayned agai~&s;t him, by &s;uch as are appointed from God &amp; the law, to be Gardians &amp; kepers of the law. But the ca&s;e of the Prince of Orenge &amp; his a&s;sociats &s;ta~deth in <HI>y^e</HI> &s;ame termes. The king with whom he hath to deale had auctoritie <HI>Temperatam Laegibus:</HI> hee
<PB REF="8">was &s;worne a&s;wel to the keeping of tho&s;e lawes and bringing in of no new, as the &s;ubiects vvere, &amp; if hee brake his othe, they vvere quit of all obedience. This appeareth in <HI>Forma iuramenti,</HI> vvhich hee toke at his Ioyous entraunce.</P>
<P>This othe &amp; Lavv vvas broken by bri~ging in a nevv lavv of Inqui&s;ition, vvhich tended to the vtter &s;uppla~ting of the Prince and &s;tates of the country, vvhich notvvythstanding they endu|red for a &s;ea&s;on, v&s;ing al dutiful meanes by complaints made from the coun&s;ell &amp; &s;tates at diuers &amp; &s;o~dry times, as are to be &s;eene, but coulde haue no redre&s;&s;e in deede, though oftentimes they had faire promi&s;es. VVhen iustice could not be had by vvay of iu&s;t complaint from the Cou~&s;ell &amp; States: the Prince &amp; States toke the maintenau~ce of the lavv into their ovvne hands, and &s;o retaine it by Iu&s;tice, re&s;eruing the auncient liberties &amp; lavves to the benefite of all the &s;ub|iects, &s;o y^t none co~playneth of wro~g done
<PB REF="9">vnto him, but the will of that Prince who woulde his will shoulde preuaile a|gai~&s;t Law to the &s;ubuer&s;ion of the whole &s;tate, as appeareth in their Records.</P>
<P>Therfore this maintenaunce of law by the Prince of Orenge, is right, again&s;t the breaker of Lawe and bringer in of Tyrannie, the Spani&s;h kinge. They &s;ay, bri~ger in of Tira~ny &amp; breaker of Law, for that contrary to his oth, wherby both he &amp; all the Erles of Holland &amp; Zela~d haue bin receiued into <HI>y^t</HI> gouernme~t, &amp; no otherwy&s;e but vpon tho&s;e condicions limitted to them by their &s;aid oth, he al|tereth the whole &s;tate of gouernmente, leaueth no law but his own wil, &amp; &s;o v|&s;eth him&s;elf, as though he had neuer bin &s;worne, nor taken the countries vvith condicion, but had entred as an ab&s;olute conquerour: Farre inferiour therin to Heathe~ &amp; barbarous Pri~ces. VVe read of Cyrus the greate Monarche of the Ea&s;te, that aboue all his &s;inguler ver|tues, which purcha&s;ed him &s;o greate a
<PB REF="9">Fame as euer any Prince had, hee had this in him, that he &s;uffered all Natio~s vnder his Monarchie to enioye their owne Lawes, customes, liberties &amp; re|ligion, and made no alteration again&s;t their wills. The like we finde recorded of Alexander the Greate, who v&s;ed him&s;elfe after the &s;ame &s;ort in all his co~|quests, contenting him onely with the Soueraignties ouer <HI>y^e</HI> Natio~s which he &s;ubdued, without any alteratio~ of their Estate. And did not the auncient Romaynes walke after the &s;ame &s;orte, whe~ they &s;ubdued any Nation to their obedie~ce? Did they euer alter the &s;tate, of any cou~try which they conquered, &amp; enforce their people to receiue their la|wes and Religion? VVhat cour&s;e v&s;ed <HI>Iulius Cae&s;ar</HI> in his Conquests of Frau~ce&punc; Did he chau~g any one iote of the &s;tate of tho&s;e Citties which he conquered?</P>
<P>Thus was the behauiour of tho&s;e barba|rous Princes, euen in their Conquests. &s;uch moderation and equitie v&s;ed they
<PB REF="10">eue~ in the middes of their fire &amp; &s;word.</P>
<P>The kinge of Spaine came not in by force, he was receyued by curte&s;ie, &amp; re|ceiued as a Patrone and Protectour of their liberties, and vpon this condition onely, had the Seigniories giuen him, as to his predece&s;&s;ours before him, that hee should keepe tho&s;e Lawes and liberties &s;afe &amp; &s;ound, by vertue of which, &amp; for pre&s;eruation wherof they cast vpon him the Erledom, as they had don in former times vpon his auncesters. Vppon this condition he toke it, &amp; to this conditi he &s;wore, as all his au~ce&s;ters did, &s;ubmit|ting &amp; yelding him&s;elfe to the like di&s;|honour that other had incurred before him, &amp; by who&s;e fall his aunce&s;ters came into that preferment, if he committed the like tre&s;pa&s;&s;e against the &s;tates. To this, (I &s;ay) he was bou~d by oth, let him|&s;elf be demaunded, if he ca~ denie it, they are co~tent to &s;tand to the condemnati|on of all the world, as fal&s;accu&s;ers of &s;o mighty a Prince, in charging him wyth
<PB REF="10">periurie, a most horrible crime both be|fore God &amp; man. But hee wil not, hee doth not denie it, it is confe&s;&s;ed of him|&s;elf and published by Print in his owne books, vnder his owne Priuiledge. How the~ &s;ta~deth his ca&s;e &amp; theirs? was he not bou~d by oth to ob&s;erue their lawes? And in ca&s;e he or any of his officers &amp; Mini|&s;ters did not ob&s;erue but breake theim, did he not expre&s;ly charge &amp; enioyne al his &s;ubiects by the &s;ame oth to make re|&s;i&s;tance against him &amp; them, and in no wy&s;e to yeld him any obedience, vntil he &s;toode and yelded to the fulfilling of his othe? The matter, as I &s;ayde, is to e|uident, books impri~ted vnder his owne Priuiledge vouch it to all the vvorlde. And shall they that &s;tand for the main|tenance of a law &s;o iustly, being further charged thereto by the kings owne oth, be notvvithstandinge deemed for re|bels? Surely if there be no more than &s;o, wee haue no rea&s;o~ &s;o to e&s;teme or iudge
<PB REF="11">of the~. Me~ might do no more, if either the kings auctority ouer the~ vvere ab|&s;olute, or they had contrary to all right of obedie~ce, made re&s;i&s;ta~ce there, where they ought to haue shewed all obedie~ce. But as the vvorld is not able to charge them vvith the one, &s;o the king I &s;uppo&s;e will not chaleng vnto him&s;elf the other. VVe finde recorded by all that are lear|ned as vvell heathen as Chri&s;tians, as vvell in lavves of the Ge~tiles as in the lavves of God: that it is one thing to be <HI>Princeps &s;upremus,</HI> a Superiour &amp; highest gouernour: &amp; an other thing to be <HI>Seni|or ab&s;olutus,</HI> an ab&s;olute lord. The one im|porteth a &s;oueraintie &amp; chieftie of all y^t are within one li&s;t of lavv, as the high|e&s;t mini&s;ter of the lavv, but yet he him|&s;elfe vvithin the compa&s;&s;e of the &s;ame lavv: the other noteth a per&s;on vvith|out the compa&s;&s;e of al iuri&s;diction, a co~|troller of all men, &amp; to be controlled of none. VVho&s;o vvould chaleng this lat|ter point to be the right of the kings ti|title
<PB REF="11">in tho&s;e cou~tryes, (I meane, that he would make him an ab&s;olute Lord &amp; not a Supreme and highe&s;t Gouernoure,) hee should greatly di&s;credite his honour in taking his othe. For force any per&s;onne what &s;oeuer he bee, to take an othe and not to mynde to keepe it, is in that degree of dishonoure, as carryeth wyth it an impietie against GOD him&s;elfe, and ingendreth a iuste &s;u&s;picion in all men that shall haue to deale with him: for who would contract with that ma~ in any &s;orte, that can &amp; will make &s;o &s;mall accompte of that, which hee hath called God him&s;elfe to witnes of, &amp; vowed to his Maie&s;tie to keepe, in the pre&s;ence of the Angels. I can not thinck &s;o euill of the honour of a Prince, as that he would enter into &s;o greate impietie: I iudge honourably of the Kinge of Spaine, and therefore I may not deeme, that he was of the Nature of that wicked Heathen, that &s;ayd for excu&s;e of him&s;elfe, in a ca&s;e of like quality. <HI>Lingua iuraui, mentem iniu|iuratam
<PB REF="12">gero:</HI> I &s;vvore wyth my tongue, &s;o that my tongue &s;tandeth bounde by othe, but I cary a minde and hart about me that hath not &s;worne, ne &s;tandeth &s;o tyed. Be it farre from any Christian, to haue &s;o euill an opinion of any Chri&s;tia~, wee haue not &s;o to thincke of any Hea|then, vnle&s;&s;e we heare him &s;peake and protest &s;o, as that wretched caitife did. VVe &s;ee euidently by his ovvne confe&s;|&s;ion, &amp; te&s;timonie of all the world, that &s;uch an oth he toke, and the honourable opinion that we oughte to conceyue of the Maie&s;tie of a Kinge muste needes per&s;vvade vs, that hee meant them as he &s;wore. As he &s;wore (I &s;ay) when hee in the &s;ame article exempted them from all obedience, and armed them that should attempte ought to the contrary: If hee &s;vvore this, and mente this, then are they no rebelles, in fulfillinge that, vvhich hee charged them vppon theyr othes.</P>
<P>But vvhat &s;aye they, that vvil (not|vvithstandinge)
<PB REF="12">iustifie the Kings do|inges and blame the &s;ubiectes with &s;o greeuous a crime. For no one iote of that that is afore&s;ayd can be denyed. They &s;aye that the Pope, who hath from GOD <HI>Plenitudine~ pote&s;tatis,</HI> Fulnes of povver, did di&s;pen&s;e vvith him from this othe. Firste if that bee &s;o, that the Pope hath freed him from his othe, then hath hee by the &s;ame facte freed them from their obedience: for they vvere in no wy&s;e, nor by vertue of any title &s;ub|iecte to him, but by vertue and title of his othe. Take the grounde of their &s;ub|iection avvay, and they are not &s;ubiect but free.</P>
<P>But vvhether it he &s;o or no, that the Pope hath throughe his ab&s;olute power, (which he calleth <HI>Plenitudine~,</HI> fulnes of povver) freed him from that othe, I knovv not: onely this I know, that the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Arras,</HI> aftervvard Cardinal of <HI>Granuile</HI> gaue him &s;uche Coun&s;ell, &amp; &s;ayd the Pope should do &s;o.

For what a&s;&s;urance ca~ they haue of all their Contracts and Leagues that pa&s;&s;e and are made betwene them, if the othes ta|ken, may be di&s;pen&s;ed withall at the Po|pes plea&s;ure? That were nothing els in deede and effecte, but to bring all true Christian Kinges and Princes, vvhich make con&s;cience and put a Religion in the bretch of their othes, into bondage &amp; &s;lauery: to make them &s;erue the plea|&s;ure and profite of the other Romishe kinge: vvho mindeth no further to ob|&s;erue his, then shall &s;tande vvith his be|nefite,

If the ca&s;e &s;tand &s;o, what faults &s;oeuer Princes haue committed in for|mer time in this behalf, I doubt not but they wilbe wy&s;er and more circum&s;pect hereafter. I meane they will make no leagues nor take anye othes of the Pope &lindx; or any Princes and States of his adhe|rentes, &s;eing they haue &s;o plaine a pre&s;i|de~t in this ca&s;e, that their othes may &amp; shalbe di&s;pen&s;ed wythall, when and how ofte &s;oeuer they li&s;te. I &s;uppo&s;e there vvas &s;uch a clau&s;e in the Contract that vvas made vvith the kinge of Spayne for the mariage of Queene Mary, that he should not alter or chaunge any one iote of the Lawes and Customes a&s;wel publike as priuate of the Realme of En|gland, if he had broken this braunch, &amp; vouched the equity of his dealing ther|in, vppon a licence &amp; di&s;pen&s;ation from the Pope, I doubt &s;ore whether the peo|ple and States of England would haue taken that for good payment: I doubte
<PB REF="14">I &s;ay, vvhether the Nobility and Com|mons of Englande, would haue &s;uffered him vnder that cloake, to haue bani|shed all the Lavves of Englande and brought in the gouernme~t of <HI>Millan</HI> or <HI>Naples?</HI> I doubt, vvhether the Nobles and people of England would haue bin acco~pted rebels for vvithstanding &s;uch breatch of Contract.

And yet hee might as iu&s;tly haue done that, as this, if this rule be good. VVe may thanck God we are deliuered from him, wee cannot tell what he woulde haue done, thoughe wee may &s;urmi&s;e by this pre&s;ident, what he might haue pretended. I tell you, this excu&s;e of periurie may &s;eeme rea&s;onable to them that are of his Court, for &s;uch a God they haue: but it is a perillous pre&s;i|dent for vs, vnle&s;&s;e wee bevvare of it.

<P>In most humble wy&s;e doo all the Knightes and Townes of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zeland,</HI> pro|test that at all times and places they haue yelded bothe vnto your Maie&s;tie, and to your Predece&s;&s;ours all humble obedien|ce,

Now whereas the Duke of <HI>Alua</HI> being then Gouernour for your Maie&s;tie ought by good rea&s;on to haue &s;hewed him&s;elfe conformable to all things before &s;ayd: Yet hath he cleane contrariwy&s;e vnder the title of his gouerne|ment, committed &s;uch iniuries and violences vppon your countries and &s;ubiectes, as well &s;pirituall as temporall, as well noble as not no|ble; as that your poore &s;ubiectes for the pre|&s;eruinge&punc; and keepinge of their priuiledges, rightes, aunciente customes, and allowed li|berties, haue bin forced again&s;te theyr will to with&s;tande with force and armes, the proude and violente kinde of gouernmente of the &s;aid Duke of <HI>Alua,</HI> and his adheren|tes and &s;traungers.

We &s;ee they &s;hoote at noone other marke, but onely to &s;ubdue thinhabitants of your Cou~try to their appetits, and in&s;olencies, onely to impoueri&s;he them, and bring them to bondage to the great hinderaunce of your Maie&s;ties &s;eruice, dig|nitie, and dominion. Whereof your &s;aide oratours haue already mo&s;te openly made &s;u|ite and prote&s;tacio~, euen as other e&s;tates and proui~ces haue ofte~ &s;ued for the &s;ame re&s;pect.

<P>Nowe therefore, &s;eing that your poore Ora|tours haue not hitherto &s;ought, neither do at this pre&s;ent &s;eeke for any other thing, than to procure as much as they may, thaduaunce|mente of their Country cau&s;e, for the better &s;eruice of your Maie&s;tie, as becommeth loyall &s;ubiects to do: They mo&s;t hu~bly request with all reuerence, that it would plea&s;e your Ma|iestie like a most gentle father, to behold &amp; loke vppon the mi&s;erable and pitifull Estate pre&s;ente of the&s;e Lowe Countryes, and to &s;et them againe in &s;ome good vnity, trade, and tranquillity. Whereby both the greatnes of your Maie&s;tie may maruelou&s;ly encrea&s;e, and al&s;o the prosperity of oure countrymen grow and flori&s;h in your &s;eruice. And &s;urely this ca~not be brought to pa&s;&s;e, &s;o long as the&s;e &s;traungers &s;halbe &s;uffred to v&s;e, and exerci&s;e their tyrannical gouernment, in our country: Con&s;idering, that all their gaines, and co~mo|ditie, con&s;isteth more in di&s;quietnes &amp; con|fu&s;ion, than in any good order or rule. And &s;urely by daily experience wee finde, that they by nature are rather giuen to their owne gre|die gaine and appetites, than to &s;eeke for any good to the&s;e Countryes, where they be but mere &s;traungers. And this is th'occa&s;ion of

More|ouer, con&s;ideringe that at the length by the co~tinuaunce of the&s;e pre&s;ent warres, nought els can be hoped for, than the pillinge, di&s;&s;olu|tion and vtter destruction of your Maie&s;ties Countryes on euery &s;ide: and &s;o much the ra|ther, for that wee &s;ee thinhabitaunts therof to giue them&s;elues euery day more and more vnto th'exerci&s;e and feates of armes, forget|ting quite, and laying a&s;ide their wonted tra|fique and trade of Marchaundize: And &s;u|re it is, that men by nature are mo&s;t commo~|ly enclined to all kinde of licentious libertie that warre bringeth with it, in &s;uch &s;ort, that by longe v&s;e, and practize of the broyles in warre, &s;uch rigour and hatred will encrea&s;e

<HEAD>To Moun&s;ire M. Iunius Atauere.</HEAD>
<P><HI>M. Iunius</HI> I did not a whit mi&s;caste my accompte, when as at oure la&s;te beings
<PB N="30" REF="34">together in the pre&s;ence of your &s;elf, and <HI>M. de Carmes,</HI> I did declare vnto <HI>Mon&s;ire de Monte Saint Aldegonde,</HI> that I feared greatly le&s;t the writing which he brought fro~ <HI>Rotterdam</HI> would find but litle fauour in the Court. For from the time that I first arriued there vntill this houre, hauing tried in euery corner how it might be taken, I finde that the opinions of all men here do &s;o farre differ fro~ the de&s;iers of all me~ there, as I dare not deale any further therein: and therefore I thought it best, to &s;ende you this letter together wyth the &s;elfe&s;ame request, that <HI>M. de Mont S. Aldegond</HI> brought vnto me annexed there|unto, to whom I would not write, for that he may receiue no papers without peru&s;ing, ney|ther could I write into your quarters, but by the &s;ame co~dicions. As I haue declared vnto you before this time: &s;o do I thincke at this pre&s;ent, that &s;om other forme of writing had bin more fit for all parts. For albeit that that which he brought was in the maner of a &s;up|plication, (as in deede all &s;ubiects ought to do towards their Pri~ces:) Yet this which they of <HI>Holland &amp; Zeland</HI> haue offred, is to farre be&s;ides the quallitie that &s;hould be loked for in that re&s;pect. For fir&s;t &amp; formo&s;t they would
<PB N="31" REF="34">that the king &s;hould di&s;arme him&s;elf, &amp; that he &s;hould not be &s;erued but with &s;uch as they like: not con&s;idering at all, that it lyeth in his power both to take or leaue armes, when hee him&s;elf li&s;teth. Who knoweth what is conue|nient for his &s;ubiects, and his affaires, better than him&s;elf? or who can tell better then he, what kinde of people will &s;erue his turne best for the profit and commoditie of the &s;ame? Whereas in deede, it is not permitted to &s;ub|iectes, no not in a good cau&s;e, to take armes but by the appointment of their Lord, neither to call in any &s;traungers as tho&s;e of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zelande</HI> haue done: therefore their faulte is &s;o much the more greuous, &amp; inex|cu&s;able, in taking theym vppe again&s;t their Prince, or again&s;t his officers which is al one, &s;ince that they be ordained by him to repre|&s;e~t his per&s;on, &amp; to occupie his place, becau&s;e he him&s;elfe cannot be in all places at once.</P>
<P>But fora&s;much as they haue offe~ded already by entering into armes of their owne priuate auctoritie, and by taking the kinges Townes, wherof, or of the re&s;titutio~ wherof they make no mention at all: in very deede, in &s;teede of their demaunding of that thinge at his Ma|ie&s;ties hand, which they of your &s;ide oughte to
<PB N="32" REF="35">performe if rea&s;on mighie take place: they &s;hould tru&s;t to the clemency of their Printe, and referre them&s;elues wholly thereunto. On thother &s;ide, it &s;eemeth al&s;o very &s;traung, that &s;ubiects, wil &s;eeme to inforce their Price to follow their appetite in a&s;&s;embling of E&s;ta|tes, yea and that generally among&s;t a &s;orte of Seignories, which in degrees, iuri&s;dictions, &amp; cu&s;tomes haue nothing in common, but onely neighbour hode th'one with thother. In deede they haue one Lord who ofte~times hath giue~ them leaue to talk at their plea&s;ure for their owne benefite, about their affaires, not mea|ning that this his bounty &s;houlde bee wre&s;ted vnto any preiudice again&s;t him&s;elfe: for it &s;eemeth certaine by the reque&s;t of this a&s;&s;em|blie, that they woulde make lawes, and keepe him as Warde. Of all other pointes which I pa&s;&s;e vnder &s;ilence, (whereof neuerthele&s;&s;e I haue oft giuen my verdite, that his Maie&s;ty may not in any point yeld vnto) I will reher&s;e no more at this pre&s;ent. Of all tho&s;e matters, I talked at lardge with <HI>Mon. de Monte S. Aldegonde.</HI> Neuertheles the great de&s;ire that I had to do &s;ome good as touchinge the quietnes of this Countrie, if God woulde permitte, and his earne&s;t requiringe that
<PB N="33" REF="35">I woulde not lightly leaue of from this enter|pri&s;e, haue made me to do the be&s;t that I can, althoughe I di&s;paired of any good i&s;&s;ue before I began. Surely I am &s;ory, be&s;ides the gene|rall cau&s;e, euen in particuler, for &s;uch as I thought very well of. And for the frend&s;hip that I haue borne vnto the hou&s;e of <HI>Mon. de Monte Saint Aldegond,</HI> I would haue wi|&s;hed that he had concluded &s;omewhat more touching the affaires of <HI>Mon&s;. le Count de Bo&s;&s;u.</HI> For after that report was made here, of the aun&s;were that was made touching that matter, by <HI>M</HI> the Prince of <HI>Orenge</HI> vnto <HI>M. de Monte S. Aldegonde:</HI> it was deter|mined here, that vppon my comming it &s;hould proceede no further, &s;ince that the good <HI>Seig|nior de Bo&s;&s;u</HI> is neuer a whit the better. I haue thoughte it good to make this reher&s;all vnto you of all that is pa&s;te &s;ince I retourned from <HI>Mountforde,</HI> partly to let you vnder|&s;tande of my foreward good will, and partly to aduerti&s;e you to &s;eeke other meanes that were more expediente for the pacification of the&s;e your calamities.

<P>SIR, fir&s;t men may thinck it &s;traunge, that the opinions of your Court ingenerall haue bin &s;o farre alienated from tho&s;e agreements which our men did mo&s;t de&s;ire, that (as your letter mencioneth) you dur&s;te not once open your mouth any further touching, that mat|ter. For it is altogether vnlikely that you who~ I haue accompted alwayes, and do accompte to be a noble gentleman, de&s;irous both of the
<PB N="38" REF="38">pre&s;eruatio~ of his Maie&s;tie, and of the quiet, and tranquillitie of the common weale: haue withdrawen your &s;elf from a bu&s;ines &s;o much importing the &s;eruice of the king, and the ge|nerall quiet and &s;afety of the whole country: vppon the opinion of certaine priuate men, and of &s;mall countenaunce in the Court. For therein you &s;hould not onely do wrong to that noble minde, and valiaunte courage which I haue alwayes &s;eene in you: but al&s;o it mighte be a di&s;credite to the greate duty, and truste you owe to his Maie&s;tie. Wherefore, I &s;aye that their opinions of whom you &s;pake, haue proceeded from certaine of the priuie Coun|cell in the&s;e estates, vpo~ whom the king hath repo&s;ed his chiefe&s;t confidence, touchinge the gouernment and rule of the&s;e Cou~tryes. The which Councellours, are &s;worne to reueale &amp; make knowen euery thing, which in their co~|&s;ciences may any way bee preiudiciall to the kinges highnes, or commoditye. They make vs thinck a&s;&s;uredly, that you haue not conferred at all with the~ of any &s;uch matter: for if they had receiued any incklinge at all thereof, of nece&s;&s;ity it mu&s;te haue come to the kinges ea|res, or at the lea&s;t to their eares who had full power and auctoritie to deale therein. Wee
<PB N="39" REF="38">cannot comprehend nor imagine what &s;hould &s;o much coole your courage, and make you a|fearde to preferre openly our reque&s;te, the which of nece&s;&s;itie (as you know) mu&s;t come to their vnder&s;tanding. And the rather be|cau&s;e that with you they doe altogether con|dempne and mi&s;like the doinges of certaine confederate gentlemen, who preferred the like &s;uite vnto <HI>Madame de Parma,</HI> in the yeare 1566. especially, becau&s;e that they did not rather v&s;e a meane more ordinary, ei|ther by &s;ome of the E&s;tates, or els by &s;ome one principall man in the Courte, who in their names might haue exhibited their &s;upplica|tion, and not to haue aduaunced them&s;elues &s;o boldly, and in &s;uch maner, as they did. Not|withstandinge, by this your example you &s;eeme to allow, and iu&s;tifie them. For you &s;ay, that if the Courte cannot dige&s;te a &s;upplica|tion or &s;uite, it is great folly for any one man, thoughe of auctoritie (as your &s;elfe is) to take vppon him, the preferringe vppe of a|nye &s;uche matter, but rather by &s;endinge it backe againe to incurre all daungers, which maye happen for wante of exhibitinge the &s;ame in conuenient time. But whereas you &s;aye, that you haue not broken the
<PB N="40" REF="39">matter to any ma~, but onely groped their min|des a farre of: &s;urely it &s;eemeth to be nothi~g an&s;werable to that profe&s;&s;ed zeale, and great affection you haue alwayes &s;eemed to beare vnto the Mat. of the king, &amp; good of his cou~|trie. The which in my iudgemente, &s;eemeth mo&s;t manife&s;t, in that you were a&s;erd to pre|&s;ent a reque&s;t &s;o expedient both for the king and his countrie. Wherfore, if the euent of thinges hereafter &s;hall happen to fru&s;trate &amp; deceiue their opinions who&s;e minds you haue but groped a farre of: a&s;&s;ure your&s;elfe it is impo&s;&s;ible for you to e&s;chew &s;ome excedinge greate blame, in that you reiected and &s;ente backe without any occa&s;ion, a reque&s;t of &s;uch importaunce. For thoughe you ment not to follow the matter your &s;elfe, yet mought you haue vttered it openly, excepte by your owne auctoritie you woulde &s;eeme to depriue both King and countrie of &s;o nece&s;&s;ary a meanes, as to haue con&s;ulted and determined, con|cerning the pointes of a generall pacificatio~. Moreouer, if tho&s;e Courtiers in auctoritie and of the priuie coun&s;ell haue &s;eene the fore|&s;aid reque&s;te, and would not make the Kinge acquainted therewith: yet &s;hould they at the lea&s;t either haue publi&s;hed that &s;elfe &s;ame
<PB N="41" REF="39">thing, which they wolde not communicate, or els haue geuen &s;omme good aduice &amp; coun|&s;aill vnto vs, withowt v&s;urping after that &s;orte their aucthoritie, in a matter that &s;o particularly did touche the Kings owne per|&s;on. For if you re&s;pect but the othe only (whe|reby his Maie&s;tie was &s;ollemly &s;worne (&amp; there vpon admytted in to this countrie) ne|uer to refu&s;e, or reiect any Bill, or &s;upplicacio~ what&s;oeuer, of any of his Subiectes, howe me|ane &s;oeuer, and muche le&s;&s;e of corporacions and whole Prouinces: Surely you nyghte haue &s;howed a &s;inguler care and earne&s;t de&s;yer for the perfourmaunce of the &s;ame. Moreouer, yt is altogether di&s;agreeing from the lawe of nature, (the which worketh effect in all people and nations) that a Prince (to whom the people haue committed their forces to thend they may be gouerned by iu&s;tice and e|quitye, and haue their cau&s;es harde) &s;hould reiect them withowt making any care or cou~|tenance to vnder&s;tand them. This did <HI>A|drian</HI> the Emperour know very well, being a Pagan and one that knew not God: who ha|uing a &s;upplicacion pre&s;ented him in the &s;treetes by a poore woman, aun&s;wered that he had not conuenient time to looke vpon &s;uche

<PB N="59" REF="48">&s;ay or beleue, that his Ma. doth co~mau~d ab&s;olutely amo~gst vs what he li&s;teth him&s;elf, &s;pecially in &s;uch a matter wherin <HI>y^e</HI> Pope pre|tendeth to haue more interre&s;t than any man aliue? I be&s;eech you if the king woulde here our reque&s;ts, &amp; finding the~ grounded vppon good rea&s;ons, were willing to grau~t vs the ex|erci&s;e of our religio~: do you thi~ck that it were lawfull for him &s;o to do? Your &s;elfe haue tould me very plainly, <HI>y^t</HI> if the king would co~di&s;ce~d to any &s;uch matter, you would take armes a|gai~&s;t him, &amp; cau&s;e (to your power) the whole cou~trie to rebell. And this I am &s;ure your &s;elf wil not denie to haue &s;aid, whe~ I was with you at <HI>Mountford.</HI> Wher the~ remayneth the fre auctoritie of the king to co~maund? where is <HI>y^e</HI> greatnes of his Ma. yea rather what becom|meth of his liberty &amp; of your Maxime, that no &s;ubiecte may take armes in ha~d without <HI>y^e</HI> appointme~t of his king &amp; lord, &s;eing that one only va&s;&s;al wil to his power cau&s;e al his E&s;tats to rebell, if that the aduice &amp; opinion of his Maie&s;ty, touching the cau&s;e of his Cou~try &amp; &s;ubiects, &s;hal not agre with his co~ceite? But I am contente to pardon you herein, con&s;ide|ringe the zeale which you beare to the Ro|mi&s;he Religion, vppon condition that you
<PB N="60" REF="49">will imagine that oure zeale which we beare vnto our Apo&s;tolicall Religio~ of the Go&s;pel, is not a whit le&s;&s;e, althoughe peraduenture it is nether &s;o plau&s;ible in mans capacitie, ney|ther &s;o profitable to them that maintaine it. Yet haue we examples very fre&s;he of the Em|perour <HI>Charles</HI> of noble memorie, who e&s;ca|ped very hardly from beinge excommunica|ted by Pope <HI>Paulus 3.</HI> for that hee graunted vnto the Almaynes but onely the <HI>Interim,</HI> which was almo&s;t conformable in all poincts vnto the decrees of the Pope. And I pray you what ado was there when he willed that a generall Councell &s;houlde be called in Al|maine, where the Almaynes might be harde in free disputacion? And finally was it not the Pope, that con&s;trained him to make warre vpon the Chri&s;tia~s, and did oftentimes threa|ten him with thundringes, if he wente not to worke with &s;peede, in &s;uch &s;ort that the Em|perour was con&s;trayned to couer the pretence of his warre with the cloke of rebellio~, to the~d he might draw vnto him <HI>Mawrice</HI> and th'o|ther Princes which were confederates of the <HI>Smalcaldiens?</HI> I &s;peake nothing here of the holy Inqui&s;ition of Spaine, nor of the Prelates of the Coun&s;ayle, which be of the Popes crea|tion,
<PB N="61" REF="49">and haue made a &s;olempne othe vnto him, neuer to agree to anye matter that they &s;hall thinck to be preiudicial to the aduau~ce|ment of the Sea of <HI>Rome,</HI> but that they &s;hall reueale the &s;ame, and re&s;ist it with all their power. Who &s;eeth not how that our king is &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with them, as hee is not able by anye meanes in the world, to iudge any thi~g in this matter contrary to their opinions &amp; aduice, vppon paine of being condempned for a rebel vnto the &s;ea of <HI>Rome?</HI> Howe then can that be true where you &s;ay, that wee make warre vppon the king? Take away once the respect of the Pope and his Prelates, and bringe to pa&s;&s;e that either the king him&s;elf be not &s;ub|iecte vnto him or els that he be content that we may be free from his lawes: and then &s;hall you &s;ee how &s;oone and how &s;oundlye, wee will yeld our &s;elues vnto the perfect obedience of our king &amp; naturall Prince, as to one annoin|ted of God him&s;elf to do vs right &amp; Iu&s;tice? And if you esteeme this to be vtterly vnrea|&s;onable, and that you meane to make the minde of oure Prince to be at the commaun|demente of other mennes willes: do not mar|uaile I pray you, if we pretend to be no rebels in &s;eeking that he maye gouerne vs by his ab|&s;olute
<PB N="62" REF="50">Auctoritie, withoute receyuing lawes from others. I come now to that other poinct where you &s;ay, <HI>That it is a very &s;traung thing for &s;ubiectes to force their Prince to a&s;&s;emble E&s;tats at their plea&s;ure.</HI> Surely this &s;eemeth very wonderfull, con&s;idering that you cannot be ig|norant, how that the king him&s;elf by his owne pure will, hath tyed him&s;elfe thereunto, as to the firme&s;t ground and &s;ure&s;t &s;taffe whereup|pon, his auctority &amp; power Regall doth chiefly (yea I may &s;ay, onely) leane &amp; re&s;t. For &s;eing the E&s;tates in a fourme of politique gouerne|ment, are none other thing but the chiefe and principall heads of the people repre&s;enting the body of the multitude: What thing is there, that can bee &s;o naturally vnited vnto a good king, who de&s;ireth to be both father and Pa|&s;tour of his people, as are the E&s;tates of his Country? Eue~ as for exa~ple, there is nothing that hath &s;uch affinity with the head of a ma~s bodye, as tho&s;e members which are called vital, for that they be the chiefest In&s;trume~ts by the which the vitall &s;pirits proceding from the braynes to diuers &s;inewes, are communi|cated in generall to the whole body, and to e|uery member, and by the which likewy&s;e, e|uery member retayneth his perfecte vnity,
<PB N="63" REF="50">and naturall knitting to the body. Euen &s;o a good king, being the head of his people, doth by the meanes of his E&s;tates, communicate and imparte vnto the whole body of his co~|mon wealth, not onely his fauoure, grace &amp; priuiledges, whereby he keepeth them in v|nitie: but al&s;o his bounty, Iustice and wi&s;e|dome, from the which as out of a quicke foun|taine, do &s;pringe good lawes &amp; Ordinaunces, whereby the people are &s;till gouerned in good di&s;cipline, as it were in the liuely being and naturall motion of the &s;ame. This is the cau&s;e why our auncestours excelling in wi&s;edome and perfecte pollioy, haue very well ordeyned heretofore, that especially the king &s;hould ve|ry &s;traightly be bounde and vnited with the Estates of the Country, not to do any thing of importau~ce without communicating the mat|ter vnto them fir&s;te, as they on the other &s;ide oughte to behaue them&s;elues vnto theyr Prince, as to their heade giuen to theim of GOD. From hence is proceeded the great and vniforme loue and Fidelitie, which Prin|ces in the&s;e partes haue borne to their peo|ple, and they likewi&s;e to them. And &s;urely this principle appeared in the per&s;on of the good Duke <HI>PHILIP,</HI> who at the firste
<PB N="64" REF="51">vnited all tho&s;e low Countries into one body, and made many lawes, the a&s;&s;ured vnitye which either is or oughte to bee betweene a Prince and his people. E&s;teeminge it better to be beloued &amp; called father by them, than to be feared and redouted of the~. For he knew well ynoughe, that loue is the &s;ure&s;t grounde and faithfulle&s;t garde of all gouernme~ts and prehemine~ces, in &s;uch &s;ort, that they be great+ly to be dete&s;ted, and to be acco~pted publique pe&s;tile~ces, who to bringe the~&s;elues in credite by villanies and &s;eruile flatteries, vnder the pretence of maintayning the auctoritie of our Prince, haue whispered in the eares of his councell, that who&s;oeuer talketh of the gene|rall a&s;&s;emble of the E&s;tates, doth catch at the Crowne from his Maie&s;ties head. For &s;urely the&s;e be the auctours of all tyra~nies, troubles, and in&s;olencies: the&s;e be the di&s;turbers of our common quiet: the&s;e be the enemies both of God and the worlde, although they attribute neuer &s;o much wi&s;dome and experience vn|to them&s;elues: doing in this ca&s;e not vnlike vnto him that would di&s;member the parts of the body from the head, and depriue them of their vertues and naturall actions, vnder the pretence of doing good to the head. True it
<PB N="65" REF="51">is, that for a time they &s;eeme to yelde as it were a &s;taye and proppe vnto the power of Princes in cau&s;inge theym in generall to be more feared than loued: but in thende they &s;hew them&s;elues to &s;eeke noughte els, but the fall of Princes, and the ouerthrow of all their people at one time: as wee &s;ee mo&s;t clearely by th'example of the kingdome of <HI>Fraunce,</HI> the calamitie and ruine whereof, hath not proceded from any thing els, but by the brea|king of thordinaunces of the E&s;tates generall, and by &s;ufferaunce that the kinge mighte go|uerne at his owne appetite with ab&s;olute au|thoritie, without hauing regard either to the body politique, or to them that &s;hould repre|&s;ent the &s;ame. I would to GOD that this poore Country of ours would behold it &s;elfe in this gla&s;&s;e, which is &s;o cleare &amp; &s;o neare vn|to it, without fallinge into the &s;ame inconue|niences. But our &s;innes being already growen to a certaine rypenes, haue ha&s;tened our vtter ouerthrowe, in blindinge the eyes of &s;uch go|uernours, as haue per&s;waded our Princes to thinck, that their ruine con&s;i&s;teth in the A&s;|&s;emblie of the generall Estates of the coun|try, who&s;e order is a common con&s;ente to re|&s;olue vppon &s;uch pointes, as do concerne the
<PB N="66" REF="52">tranquillitie of the &s;ame: whereas, if at the least this had bin lookt vnto in the begi~ning, before that tho&s;e troubles did breake out in|to &s;o great a flame according to tho&s;e in&s;tru|ctions which the Gentlemen of the confede|rates gaue vnto his Maie&s;tie: &s;urely then might all the inco~ueniences which haue hap|pened &s;ince, haue very well bin auoyded.

But let vs &s;ee how the&s;e matters will hang together. You &s;ay, <HI>That it is but by &s;peciall grace and fauour, that the aunce&s;toure of our king haue &s;uffered and permitted a generall Conuocation of the E&s;tates in vrgente affayres.</HI> Admit that it were &s;o: yet &s;urely it were a great di&s;curte&s;ie to per&s;wade the king to &s;hew le&s;&s;e fauour vnto the&s;e Countries than his predece&s;&s;ours haue done: and it were the waye to force him to &s;eeke &s;ome other kinde of &s;uperioritie, and gouernemente, cleane co~|trary

But &s;ure I cannot imagine that you are &s;o ignorant of the Chro+nicles, or &s;uch a &s;traunger to the knowledge of the &s;tate of the&s;e Countries, as that you know not how that &s;ince the time of <HI>Charle|mayne,</HI> the&s;e Countries and Prouinces haue euer bin vnited in one body together, with ma+ny other neighbours &amp; borderers, vnder the title of beinge called <HI>Au&s;tra&s;ia or Lorein,</HI> which toke that name, for that in diui&s;ion, that part fel to one of his nephews called <HI>Lho+thayre:</HI> and how that afterward by diuer&s;i|ty of &s;ucce&s;&s;ours, beinge di&s;membred thone from the other, yet they did alwayes keepe a certaine vnitie of Amitie and alliaunce to|gether, euen vntill the tyme of the good Duke <HI>Philip,</HI> who broughte them againe into one body, and tyed them fa&s;t and vn&s;eperable by many good ordinaunces, lawes and priuiled|ges, which he gaue vnto them in generall, &s;he|wing him &s;elfe therein to be both a father to
<PB N="71" REF="54">his Country, &amp; a pa&s;tour to his people, in &s;uch &s;ort that it was offred vnto him by the Empe|rour and Pope for that tyme, to make therof a kingdome, the which he would neuer agree vnto, both becau&s;e that he would not offer by &s;uch innouations any kinde of preiudice vn|to the Priuiledges of the Proui~ces and Tow|nes particulerly, neither yet go again&s;t the o|thes that he had &s;worne vnto them. And if you li&s;te to alledge, that oure Kinge doth at this pre&s;ent occupie certain prouinces which then had nothing a do with them: I will aun|&s;were, that likewi&s;e the fore&s;aid Duke did at that time enioy certaine others, almost of like importaunce, the which haue &s;ince that time bin &s;eperated, and di&s;membred in &s;uch &s;ort, that the &s;aid good Duke <HI>Philip</HI> being recei|ued into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Hollande</HI> and <HI>Ze|lande</HI> almost in the ende of his raigne, did leaue this coniunction of the&s;e Prouinces vnto his &s;onne and onely heire <HI>CHARLES</HI> the hardy, who being of a more hauty minde went about openly to make the&s;e Countries a kingdome, had he not bin hindered part|lye by the Estates of the &s;aide Countries whoe with&s;toode the &s;ame, and partly by
<PB N="72" REF="55">the di&s;fauour of the Emperour <HI>Frederick 3.</HI> who raigned at that time. But let the cau&s;e be as be may: hee left vnto his daughter and heire, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of all the &s;aid countries, as one body vnited and knitte together with many fa&s;te and &s;traighte bandes: after the which &s;orte <HI>Maximilian</HI> her hu&s;bande the Emperour, and his &s;onne the Archeduke <HI>Phillip,</HI> receiued the &s;ame, and in &s;uch &s;ort lefte theim vnto the Emperour of noble me|mory <HI>Charles</HI> the fifte father to oure Kinge: who being not content with the fore&s;aid con|iunction and bandes, and as it were fore&s;eing how that afterwards &s;ome would go about to &s;owe hatred among&s;t them, and to &s;et th'one again&s;t thother, vnder this prete~ce that they had nothinge common amonge them&s;elues: tooke awaye and aboli&s;hed from theim all the diuer&s;itie of Que&s;tions that mighte encoun|ter them, &s;ome from vnder the Crowne of <HI>Fraunce,</HI> &s;ome from the title of the Empyre, and &s;ome from other places. And at a ge|nerall diet of Almaigne, by the con&s;ente of all the Electours and E&s;tates of the Empyre, hee vnited and broughte together all the&s;e prouinces into one compa&s;&s;e or Circle of the Empyre, ordayning and appointing that from
<PB N="73" REF="55">that tyme forward, all they &s;hould ioyntly and vn&s;eperably be acknowledged too be of the Empire, and that for that cau&s;e, they &s;houlde pay in thordinary contribucions of the Em|pire, as muche as twoe Electors did. And this hath been inuiolablye kept bothe of his Maie&s;tie: of noble memory, And al&s;o by own king and Mai&s;tar that now is, &s;o farre foorth as that his Maie&s;tie did &s;ende one <HI>S.</HI> of <HI>Hooch&s;trate</HI> into <HI>Almaigne</HI> in his name, to acknowledge the fore&s;aid prouinces as one bodye politique ioyned to the Empire. And for &s;uch were they taken at that time: &s;oe that I cannot &s;ufficienly meruaile, howe you can &s;aye that in degrees and Iuri&s;dictions they be &s;o dyuers, and that there is nothing common among&s;t them, but only neighborhod.

But what &s;hall we &s;ay? when his Maie&s;tie propounded the nece&s;&s;itie of his warre with <HI>Frau~ce</HI> in the yeare 1557: in what &s;orte did the E&s;tates then chardg them &s;elues with that great burden, but only in generall? the which warre in thend of nine yeres with a &s;ingle fidelitye &s;hewed towardes their King, &amp; a woonderfull vnitye kept among the~ &s;el|ues, they brought to happy end by their nine yeres co~tribucio~, to the great glorye &amp; honour of his roiall Maie&s;tie. Is it rea&s;on then that in making warre vpon a &s;traunge Prince, theys prouinces &s;halbe but one body, and the E&s;ta|tes vnited together: and that in turninge a|way from them&s;elues an vtter overthrow pro+cured by this ciuill warre, they &s;halbe counted diuers &amp; di&s;membred, &amp; not be &s;uffred to a&s;|&s;emble the e&s;tates general, to thende that by a generall remedye they may help and cure a common maladie?

Howe cometh it to pa&s;&s;e, that at fea&s;tes and publique places, the townes &amp; prouinces haue bin alwayes called together by publique aucthority: but only to &s;hewe the vnity of the poore countrie, euen as <HI>Grece</HI> did by the a&s;|&s;emblye at their <HI>Olimpiades?</HI> Is not the name of the Ba&s;e <HI>Almaignes</HI> or <HI>Flemings</HI> (as the <HI>Spaniardes</HI> do cal vs at this day) co~|mon vnto vs all?

And if there were none other thing to alledge, but that owr King and the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> had made al their Edicts and Plackartes of Religion in generall to all the prouinces, weare not that a &s;ufficient Argument to confute your &s;aying, that they haue nought in co~mon the one with thother? yea rather is it not a full iu&s;tification of the re|que&s;t of tho&s;e of <HI>Holland,</HI> and <HI>Zeland</HI> in that point, if you will be ruled by right and rea&s;on <HI>Quod omnes attingit, ab omnibus probari debet?</HI> for if the rigowr of tho&s;e Placartes laid vpon all theis Prouinces in generall, hathe cau&s;ed a generall alteracion of the people: Why &s;houlde not we a&s;&s;emble and call together the generall e&s;tates of theis pro|uinces, to remedye &s;uche inconueniences as generally doe light vpon vs all? And &s;ure this is the better co~firmed by tho&s;e two cau&s;es that you alleadged, for the which Princes in tymes pa&s;t were wont to a&s;&s;emble generall e&s;tates, that is to witt, <HI>the benefit of their Cou~|trie
<PB N="77" REF="57">and the vveale of their affaires.</HI> For they coulde neuer be better &s;poken, of than at this pre&s;ent, when we treat not of one &s;imple benifitt, but of the whole &s;affetye of owr cou~|trie and e&s;peciall re&s;titucion of his Maie&s;ties dignitye. Wherefore if euer there weare cau&s;e to a&s;&s;emble e&s;tates in generallitye, &s;ure|ly now there is greater cau&s;e &s;oe to doe than e|uer ther was. This notwith&s;tanding (if I may &s;peake of myne owne hed, witheowt thadui&s;e of the E&s;tates and Townes in theis partes) I doe thinck that if the King or his coun&s;ell be offended with this generallity, they will be content to haue agraunt from his Maie&s;tie that they may lawfully a&s;&s;emble the &s;tates on|ly of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zeland,</HI> and that it will plea&s;e hym to ratifie that which they &s;hall find by &s;ounde cou~&s;ell and deliberacio~, to be fit for his Maie&s;ties &s;eruice, and for their cou~tries &s;affetye. Con&s;idering that herin (as I haue &s;aid) they haue had agreater re&s;pect to the Auctorite of the King, than to any thing els. But it &s;eemeth that there is &s;ome other hidde~ cau&s;e which moueth you to be &s;o &s;u&s;pitious of this a&s;&s;embling of e&s;tates in that you &s;aye <HI>that this reque&s;t &s;eemeth to be made as it vvere to tye him to a lavv, and to kepe him as a vvarde</HI> I can|not
<PB N="78" REF="58">beleue but that this proceedeth rather of &s;ome ill grounded conceytes, or &s;ini&s;ter &s;u&s;pi|cions of &s;uche in the court; as cannot di&s;ge&s;t owr &s;imple peticion, than of your owne good iudgement or adui&s;e. I cannot be par&s;waded that you can digre&s;&s;e &s;o farre from all rea&s;on. For &s;urely you know well ynoughe, howe that the mo&s;te true and legittimate power and dignitie of all kinges, monarches, and Empe|rours, &amp; the greate&s;t vnitye &amp; pro&s;peritye of all people and prouinces, dothe e&s;pecialie co~|&s;i&s;t, and principally depende vpon the a&s;&s;emble of e&s;tates: eue~ as it appeareth in <HI>Almaigne</HI> &amp; in al other Kingdomes &amp; Prouinces which are wel &amp; quietly gouerned. For tho&s;e a&s;&s;embles which we call Edictes in the comon wealthe, are euen the &s;ame which in the churce of God were called coun&s;elles, the which owr au~ce&s;|tors, holy fathers &amp; doctors in the Prima|tiue churche helde in &s;uche reuerence &amp; e&s;ti|macion, as that they ordeigned that fro~ half yere to half yeare, or at the furthe&s;t from yere to yere, generall Sinodes &s;hould bee called as often as any nece&s;&s;itye required. Whereunto they euer had a mo&s;te &s;oueraigne recour&s;e, vntill &s;uche tyme as that the great power of the Popes did &s;ubdewe the Sinodes by their
<PB N="79" REF="58">ab&s;olute aucthoritie, again&s;t the which owr forefathers at mani tymes, and e&s;peciallye in the cou~cell of <HI>Ba&s;il,</HI> did mo&s;te openly re&s;i&s;t. They ordeigned that from tenne yere to ten yeares a generall coun&s;ell and Synode &s;hould be called thorow owt all Chri&s;tendome wher|u~to the Pope him&s;elf &s;houlde be &s;ubiect. Which thing was &s;o odious vnto the ambicion of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ours of that Pope, as that to their power they haue hindred euer &s;ince the a&s;&s;e~|ble of the councelles, &s;o farr foor thas that in the great nece&s;&s;itye of Chri&s;tendome, and at the earne&s;t &s;olliciting of the Emperour <HI>Char|les,</HI> the councell of <HI>Trent</HI> was at length cal|led and prolonged almo&s;te by the &s;pace of 30. yeres after with a 1000. Kindes of delayes &amp; excu&s;es to delay the &s;ame. After that like|wi&s;e in the councell of <HI>Con&s;taunce, Thoan</HI> the 32. one of the 3. Popes that were degra|ded at that tyme, being accu&s;ed of 50. articles at the lea&s;t, and all tho&s;e cryminall, &s;ighing &s;ore, aun&s;wered thus: that be&s;ides all tho&s;e faultes, he had co~mitted a greater offence, &amp; that was for becau&s;e that he had &s;uffered &s;uche a free councell to be called as him &s;elf was bounde to be ruled by, &amp; the reby he him &s;elf was with great infamye depo&s;ed. I doe
<PB N="80" REF="59">alledge all this, to &s;howe that it is the parte of Tyrantes only to mi&s;like generall a&s;&s;em|blies, and that all good Princes Kinges and Emperours haue alwaies de&s;icred theis diet|tes and a&s;&s;emblies, as all good prelates haue (to their power) procured the a&s;&s;emble of Synodes and councels in the Churche of God. For this is certein, that whereas many doe a&s;&s;emble to|gether and con&s;ult, (whether yt be for the af|faires of the co~mon welthe, or of the churche of God,) there ordinarily is God him &s;elf pre&s;ident, &amp; &s;endeth his good&s;pirit, lightninge mo&s;te commo~ly the eyes of a nomber in &s;uche ca&s;es, as paraduenture one alone or a fewe ca~|not di&s;cerne awhit. Wherefore me thine|keth that in this ca&s;e they of <HI>Holla~d</HI> &amp; <HI>Ze|la~d</HI> haue declared what great confidence they haue in the mercifull gouernment and cle|mency of the King, in hauing &s;et be fore his face the true and only meane to pacifie the troubles of this countrie. For &s;ynce that in any wi&s;e they mu&s;te make no que&s;tions of Religio~ what coulde they in this worlde offer with more humilite and better right, than to &s;ubmit the~ &s;olues to the Iudgement of his Maie&s;tie: in a generall a&s;&s;emble of all owr e&s;tates, &s;hewing therin that they feared not at all to haue
<PB N="81" REF="59">their cau&s;e brought to light before the face of the whole world and of his Maie&s;tie, becau&s;e they felte them&s;elues cleare from all crimes which wrongfully were laide to their charge? And if their religion were &s;o wicked as the Kinge is informed that it is: what can they do more &s;incerely than with humble &s;ute to re|quest that it might be iudged and tryed, eue~ by tho&s;e who haue prote&s;ted mo&s;t plainly, that they will by no meanes admit or receiue the &s;ame? Ca~ there be any thing more conuenie~c for the dignity and honour of his Maie&s;tie, or for to expre&s;&s;e their owne faithfull &s;eruice, than to &s;ubmit them&s;elues wholly to the iudg+ment of his Ma. and of tho&s;e E&s;tates which he &s;hall lawfully call together? It &s;eemeth cer|tainly that you among&s;t you do feare and flye from the iudgement and aduice of the kinge, and that you take him to be &s;o childi&s;he, as that he cannot di&s;cerne white from blacke, or els that your &s;elues mu&s;t pre&s;cribe him what he &s;hall do. For you hindered our reque&s;t from co~minge to his cares. It falleth out now, that your &s;elues are they y^t make the king a Ward, in that you will not &s;uffer him to here the co~|plaints and &s;utes of his &s;ubiectes. This is to take the Crowne from his Maie&s;tyes head, &amp;
<PB N="82" REF="60">to make your &s;elues kinges: Con&s;idering that the dignity and prehemie~nce of Royalty, doth not &s;o much con&s;i&s;t vpon titles and ritches, as in the di&s;cerninge &amp; iudging of the co~plaints and reque&s;ts of his &s;ubiects &amp; in admini&s;tri~g Iu&s;tice vnto them. The prete~ce then of the&s;e <HI>Holla~ders</HI> &amp; <HI>Zela~ders</HI> is &s;o farre fro~ maki~g him a Warde, as that y^e onely mark that they te~d vnto, is to &s;et him at his ful liberty again, which is to iudge lawfully (accordinge to the cu&s;tome of his Aunce&s;tours) vpon all the con|trouer&s;ies, &amp; complaints of his people: which libertie you haue cleane bere&s;t him of, &amp; yel|ded the &s;ame vnto the Italian Pope, &amp; to the Prelats of the inqui&s;icio~, &amp; barred him clene both from hearing &amp; iudging of his &s;ubiects cau&s;es. As touching the la&s;t point, wherin you &s;ay, <HI>That in your opinion his Maie&s;tye ought not to yelde vnto our reque&s;t, no not one iote:</HI> Sure|ly I do mo&s;t of all marueile, that you woulde wi&s;h the K. to iudge no otherwy&s;e than as you li&s;t. If you be va&s;&s;all to the K. leaue the choi&s;e to his Maie&s;tie, whether he wil yelde or not, and do not you pre&s;cribe a law, before that he him&s;elf haue fir&s;t herd our reque&s;ts, &amp; after|wards giuen his iudgement vppon the &s;ame. Otherwi&s;e you will giue the worlde to vnder|&s;ta~d,
<PB N="83" REF="60">how that you take the king to be &s;o igno|raunt, as that he cannot iudge of his owne af|fayres, or els that your opinion mu&s;t be a law, whereby his Maie&s;tie mu&s;t of force be ruled. Well, if your opinion which you haue grou~ded vpon your owne conceite, be &s;o fa&s;t &s;ettled in your &s;tomacke as that you will not alter the &s;ame: Yet I woulde ye con&s;idered, that all the E&s;tates and Cities in the&s;e quarters, be of an other minde. And peraduenture it may bee, that if the opinion of all the E&s;tates in gene|ral may be vnder&s;tood the greater part of the~ wilbe of our minde. If you thinck otherwy&s;e, why do yee not &s;uffer the matter to come to proofe, by leauinge to his maie&s;tie full liberty to iudge &amp; di&s;cerne of all &s;utes &amp; reque&s;ts? except your meani~g be, that we mu&s;t of force take your opinion for the kings determinacio~. But &s;urely for mine owne parte, I cannot yet be &s;o well per&s;waded of your great mode&s;tie &amp; wi&s;edome. Wherefore I am to reque&s;t you, that (without &s;uffering your &s;elfe to be any longer blinded wyth the&s;e cauilling pretences) you indeuour your &s;elf in good faith &amp; true mea|ninge, to further the tranquillity and quiet of the&s;e Countries, the which cannot by anye meanes be ree&s;tabli&s;hed, but by this, that the
<PB N="84" REF="61">king may haue his auctoritie kept to him&s;elfe inuiolablie, in hearing and co~&s;idering the re|que&s;tes and controuer&s;ies of all &s;uch his Sub|iectes, as crye and call for his helpe and mer|cye: that hee may &s;ee &s;ome remedie for the &s;ame, by the common aduice of the generall E&s;tates of the Countrie, and that he &s;uffer vs not to bee oppre&s;&s;ed by the cruell tiranny of Strangers, who &s;eeke nothing els but to &s;ati&s;|fie their couetous mindes and greedines of gaine, with the price of our bloude and wyth the vtter ouerthrow &amp; de&s;olacion of his ma|iesties inheritau~ce in the&s;e Prouinces, to the great dimini&s;hing of his Maie&s;ties Royall E|&s;tate, not caringe a point though all this go to wracke, &s;o that they may returne into their Countries againe, loden &amp; charged with the &s;poile of vs, from the which I hope that Al|mighty God will defende vs with his pui&s;&s;ant Arme, as he hath done heretofore.</P>
