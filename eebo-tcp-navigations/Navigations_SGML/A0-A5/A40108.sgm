<HEAD>A true Relation of the Voyage undertaken by me <HI>Robert Fowler,</HI> with my &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el called the <HI>Woodhou&s;e,</HI> but performed by the Lord, like as he did <HI>Noahs</HI> Ark, wherein he &s;hut up a few righteous per|&s;ons, and landed them as &s;afe, even as at the Hill <HI>Ararat.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The true Di&s;cour&s;e taken as followeth:</P>
<P>THis Ve&s;&s;el was appointed for this &s;ervice from the beginning, as I have often had it manife&s;ted unto me, that it was &s;aid within me &s;everal times, <HI>Thou hath her not for nothing,</HI> and al&s;o <HI>New-England</HI> pre&s;ented before me; al&s;o when &s;he was fini&s;hed and fraughted, and made to Sea, contrary to my will, was brought to <HI>London,</HI> where &s;peaking touching this matter to <HI>Gerrard Roberts</HI> and others, who confirmed the matter in behalf of the Lord, that it mu&s;t be &s;o; yet entring into rea&s;oning, and letting in temptations and hard&s;hips, and the lo&s;s of my life, wife and children, with the enjoyments of all earthly things, it brought me as low as the grave, and laid me as one dead, as to the things of God, but by his In&s;trument <HI>G. F.</HI> was I refre&s;hed and rai&s;ed up again, which before that it was much contrary to my &s;elf, that I could as wil|lingly have died, as have gone, but by the &s;trength of God I was made willing to do his will; yea, the cu&s;toms and fa|&s;hions of the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e could not &s;top me: &s;till was I a&s;&s;aulted with the Enemy, who pre&s;&s;ed from me my &s;er|vants, &s;o that for this long Voyage we were but two men and three boys, be&s;ides my &s;elf. Upon the fir&s;t day of the fourth Moneth received I the Lords &s;ervants aboard, who came with a mighty hand and an out-&s;tretched arm with
<PB N="4" REF="3">
them, &s;o that with courage we &s;et Sayl and came into the <HI>Downs</HI> the &s;econd day, where our dearly beloved <HI>W. D.</HI> with <HI>Mich. Tom&s;on</HI> came aboard, and in them we were much refre&s;hed, and after recommending us to the grace of God, we lanched forth: Again rea&s;on entred upon me, and thoughts ro&s;e in me to have gone to the Admiral, and have made my complaint for the want of my &s;ervants and a Convoy, from which thing was I withholden by that hand which was my helper: Shortly after the South winde blew a little hard, &s;o that it cau&s;ed us to put in at <HI>Ports|mouth,</HI> where I was furni&s;hed with choice of men, according to one of the Captains words to me, <HI>That I might have enough for money,</HI> but he &s;aid my Ve&s;&s;el was &s;o &s;mall, he would not go the Voyage for her. Certain days we lay there, wherein the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t were not idle, but went forth and gathered &s;ticks, and kindled a fire, and left it burning; al&s;o &s;everal friends came aboard and vi&s;ited us, in which we were refre&s;hed: Again we lanched from thence about the eleventh day, and was put back again into <HI>South-Yarmouth,</HI> where we went a&s;hore, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure did the like; al&s;o we met with three pretty large &s;hips, which were for the <HI>New-found Land,</HI> who did accompany us a|bout 50 leagues, but might have done 300, if they had not feared the Men of War, but for e&s;caping them they took to the Northwards, and left us without hope of help to the outward, which before our parting it was &s;hewed to <HI>H. N.</HI> early in the morning, that they were nigh unto us that &s;ought our lives, and called unto me, and told me, but &s;aid he, thus &s;aith the Lord, You &s;hall be carryed away as in a Mi&s;t, and pre&s;ently we e&s;pied a great Ship making up towards us, and the three great Ships were much afraid, and tacked about with what &s;peed they could for it; in the
<PB N="5" REF="3">
very interim the Lord God fulfilled his promi&s;e, and &s;truck our enemies in the face with a contrary wind, wonderfully to our refre&s;hment; then upon our parting from the&s;e three Ships, we were brought to ask coun&s;el at the Lord, and the word was from him, <HI>Cut through, and &s;teer your &s;treighte&s;t cour&s;e, and minde nothing but me,</HI> unto which thing he much provoked us, and cau&s;ed us to meet together every day, and he him&s;elf met with us, and manife&s;ted him&s;elf largely unto us, &s;o that by &s;torms we were not prevented above three times in all our Voyage; The Sea was my figure, for if any thing got up within, the Sea without ro&s;e up again&s;t me, and then the Floods clapt their hands, of which in time I took notice, and told <HI>H. N.</HI> Again in a vi&s;ion in the night I &s;aw &s;ome Anchors &s;wimming above the water, and &s;ome thing al&s;o of a Ship which cro&s;t our way, which in our mee|ting I &s;aw fulfilled, for I my &s;elf with others, had lo&s;t ours, &s;o that for a little &s;ea&s;on the Ve&s;&s;els run loo&s;e in a maner, which afterwards by the wi&s;dom of God was recovered in|to a better condition then before: Al&s;o upon the twenty fifth day of the &s;ame moneth in the morning, we &s;aw an|other great Ve&s;&s;el making up towards us, which did ap|pear a far off to have been a Frigot, and made her &s;ign for us to come to them, which unto me was a great cro&s;s, we being to windward of them; and it was &s;aid, <HI>Go &s;peak him, the cro&s;s is &s;ure, did I ever fail thee therein?</HI> and unto others there appeared no danger in it, &s;o that we did, and it proved a Trade&s;man of <HI>London,</HI> by whom we writ back; Al&s;o it is very remarkable, when we had been five weeks at Sea in a dark &s;ea&s;on, wherein the powers of darkne&s;s appear|ed in the greate&s;t &s;trength again&s;t us, having &s;ayled but a|bout 300 leagues, <HI>H. N.</HI> falling into communion with God, told me that he had received a comfortable An&s;wer, and
<PB N="6" REF="4">
al&s;o that about &s;uch a day we &s;hould land in <HI>America,</HI> which was even &s;o fulfilled; Al&s;o thus it was all the Voyage with the faithful, which were carried far above &s;torms and tem|pe&s;ts, that when the Ship went either to the right or left hand, their lines joyned all as one, and did direct her way, &s;o that we have &s;een and &s;aid, we &s;ee the Lord lead our Ve&s;|&s;el, even as it were a man leading a hor&s;e by the head, we re|garding neither latitude nor longitude, but kept to our Line, which was, and is our Leader, Guide and Rule, but they that did, failed. Upon the la&s;t day of the fifth moneth we made land, it was part of the <HI>Long I&s;land,</HI> far contrary to the expectation of the Pylot; Furthermore our drawing had been all the Voyage to keep to the Southwards, until the evening before we made land, and then the word was, <HI>There is a Lion in the way,</HI> unto which Lion we gave obe|dience, and &s;aid, Let them &s;teer Northwards until the day following, and &s;oon after the middle of the day, there was drawings to meet together before our u&s;ual time, and it was &s;aid, That we may look abroad in the evening, and as we &s;ate waiting upon the Lord, they di&s;covered the land, and our mouthes was opened in Prayer and Thank&s;giving; as way was made, we made towards it, and e&s;pying a Creek, our advice was to enter there, but the will of man re&s;i&s;ted, but in that e&s;tate we had learned to be content, and told him both &s;ides was &s;afe, but going that way would be more trouble to him; al&s;o he &s;aw after he had laid by all the night, the thing fulfilled.</P>
<P>Now to lay before you in &s;hort, the largene&s;s of the Wi&s;dom, Will and Power of God, Thus this Creek led us in between the <HI>Dutch Plantation</HI> and <HI>Long I&s;land,</HI> where the moving of &s;ome friends whereunto, which
<PB N="7" REF="4">
otherwi&s;e had been very difficult for them to have gotten too: Al&s;o the Lord God that moved them, brought them to the place appointed, and us into our way, accor|ding to the word which came to <HI>C. H. You are in the road to Road I&s;land.</HI> In that Creek came a Shallop to meet us, taking us to be &s;trangers, making our way with our Boat, and they &s;poke Engli&s;h unto us, and informed us, and al&s;o guided us along: The power of the Lord fell much upon us, and an unre&s;i&s;table word came unto us, <HI>That the Seed in</HI> America <HI>&s;hall be as the &s;and of the &s;ea.</HI> It was publi&s;hed in the ears of the Brethren, which cau&s;ed tears to break forth with fulne&s;s of joy, &s;o that pre&s;ently for the&s;e pla|ces they prepared them&s;elves, which were <HI>Robert Hog|gen, Richard Dowdney, Sarah Gibbins, Mary Witherhead,</HI> and <HI>Dorothy Waugh,</HI> which the next day were put &s;afely a&s;hore: Into the Dutch Plantation called <HI>New Am&s;ter|dam,</HI> we came, and it being the fir&s;t day of the week, &s;e|veral came aboard on us, and we begun our work: I was cau&s;ed to go to the Governor, and <HI>Robert Hoggen</HI> with me; he was moderate both in words and actions. <HI>Robert</HI> and I had &s;everal days before &s;een in a vi&s;ion the Ve&s;&s;el in great danger; the day following this was fulfilled, there being a pa&s;&s;age between two Lands, which is called by the name of <HI>Hell-gate,</HI> we happened very conveniently of a Pylot, and into that place we came, and into it were for|ced, and over it was carried, which I never heard of any before that was; and the Scripture is fulfilled in our eyes, in the Figure, <HI>Hells gates</HI> cannot prevail again&s;t you: rocks many on both &s;ides, &s;o that I believe one yards length, would have endangered lo&s;s of both Ve&s;&s;el and Goods; Al&s;o there were a &s;cull of fi&s;hes pur&s;ued our Ve&s;&s;el, and followed her &s;trongly, and along clo&s;e by our Rudder;
<PB N="8" REF="5">
and in our meeting it was &s;hewed me, The&s;e fi&s;hes is to thee a Figure, Thus doth the Prayers of the Churches proceed to the Lord for thee and the re&s;t: &s;urely in our meeting did the thing run through me as oyl, and did me much rejoyce.</P>
