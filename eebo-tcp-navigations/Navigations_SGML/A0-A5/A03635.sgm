<P><HI>_IT was not with|out</HI> great rea&s;on, (gen|tle Reader,) that the auncient Poets in old time; fained <HI>Phaeton</HI> to fal from heauen, and to be drowned in the deapth of the Sea: becau&s;e not con|tented with his calling, he woulde of a prowde ambicious minde, pre&s;ume to take vppon him the gouernement of his Father <HI>Phaebus</HI> Chariot, being a thing farre beyond his &s;kil to compas. For &s;urely there is not in the whole world, a more pe&s;tilent euil, or a thing that breedeth &s;o much mi&s;chife, as doth the cankred and mo&s;t accur&s;ed vice of ambition, which not onely worketh the ruine of the partye therewith po&s;|ce&s;&s;ed: but often times cau&s;eth the con|fu&s;ion of many mighty Monark<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> and
<PB REF="3"> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters">e vtter ouerthrovv of whole Coun|treyes and common weales.</P>
<P>Wherewith the words of <HI>Cornelius <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 chunk">rus</HI> do verry aptly agree, who &s;aith that after the de&s;ier of principallytie had longe continued in the mindes of men vndi&s;couered: when Princes be|<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">an to enlarge their Limittes, and to make their dominions greater: when they began to conquer kingdomes, and enuying the felicitie of common weales, de&s;ired the confu&s;ion and vtter ouerthrowe one of another. Then be|gan this ambition fir&s;t of all to breake out, which as (Saint <HI>Barnard</HI> &s;aieth) plea&s;eth and delighteth euery man, and yet is there nothinge that doth more cruelly crucifie or breede more vnqui|etnes, then it doth.</P>
<P>For from whence &s;pringeth bloody warres &s;o much, as from this roote of Ambition.</P>
<P>What cau&s;eth &s;o manye to endure the extremitie of the coulde Winter nightes, by lying abroade in the open
<PB REF="3"> Feeldes without any harbour, and to abide the heate of the whot Sommer &s;ea&s;on being clogged with the carry|age of their vnweldye armoure: but onelye ambicion?</P>
<P>Is it ought els but this greedy ambi|tion, that maketh men to trauell &s;o many intemperate countryes, and de&s;|perately to runne into &s;o many doubt|full daingers as they do?</P>
<P>In conclu&s;ion, there is nothing that more breaketh the bandes of beneuo|lence, abateth the obedience of childre~ towardes their Parentes: the loue of Parentes, towardes their Children: the dutye of &s;ubiectes, towardes their Princes, and the care of Countryes commoditye, from al men, as doth this abominable vice of ambicion.</P>
<P>Whereof dyuers hi&s;toryes a&s;well of auncient time, as examples daylye &s;hewed among&s;t vs, is a mo&s;t perfect te&s;timony.</P>
<P>By the greedye ambition of <HI>Scilla Marius, Carbo, Cinna, Pompeius,</HI> and <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI>
<PB REF="4"> there were more &s;laine among&s;t the <HI>Romaines,</HI> then in conquering to them the kingdome of the whole world.</P>

<P>Al&s;o <HI>Pompeius</HI> and <HI>Iulius Cae&s;ar,</HI> the one &s;uffring no peere, the other no &s;u|periour, by their in&s;a&s;iable ambition, cau&s;ed innumerable people to be &s;laine betweene them, and &s;ubuerted the be&s;t and mo&s;t renowmed publique weale, in the whole world: and finally, enioy|ing little time to reioyce them in theyr vnlawfull de&s;ires, <HI>Pompeius</HI> &s;hamefullye flyinge, had his head &s;troken off, by the commaundement of <HI>Ptolome</HI> Kinge of <HI>Egipt:</HI> vnto whom as to his frende he fled for &s;uccour, and <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> that was the vanqui&s;her, was &s;hortlye after cruellye murdred in the Senate, with daggers, by them whom he be&s;t tru&s;ted, and mo&s;t &s;pecially fauowred.</P>
<P>It would require much time, and a
<PB REF="4"> verye large volume, to make mencion of all tho&s;e that heretofore, by coueting to encrea&s;e their credit and e&s;timation in the worlde, and to aduaunce them|&s;elues to high dignities, haue brought both them&s;elues and their countryes to extreame daunger.</P>
<P>But I will leaue heere to rehear&s;e any more of &s;uch antiquitye, and &s;hew a more liuely &amp; lamentable example, of three renowmed Princes: who not longe &s;ince by their ambicious de&s;ires, did not onely procure their owne vn|timely death: but al&s;o the de&s;truction of many thou&s;andes of their people, in the maintenaunce of their vniu&s;t quar|rels, as by that which followeth &s;hall more manife&s;tly appeare.</P>

<P>_VNder&s;tande, that not long &s;ynce, there raygned ouer the countrey of <HI>Barbary,</HI> a King named <HI>Mully Hamet Shek&punc;</HI> who had diuers Sons by &s;un|dry his Wiues and Concubines: for there they maye haue as manye wiues as they wyll.</P>
<P>The King pa&s;&s;ing on a tyme from <HI>Moroccus,</HI> the chiefe City of his cou~|trey, towards another Countrey of his, called <HI>Sus,</HI> was in the mydway, at a place called <HI>Bibon,</HI> murdred by his owne men.</P>
<P>After him raigned one of his Sons called <HI>Mulla Abdula:</HI> by who&s;e mea|nes a Noble man of y^t countrey, cal|led <HI>Alcatho Alley,</HI> cau&s;ed the throtes of eleuen of the Kinges Brethren, to be cutte in one morning.</P>
<PB REF="6">
<P> Two other of his brethren fled for feare into Turky, and were there brought vp in the <HI>Turks</HI> warres.</P>
<P>One other of his Brethren named <HI>Mulla Hamet,</HI> remayned &s;tyll in <HI>Bar|bary,</HI> without any violence offered vnto him, and was well beloued of his wicked brother: &s;o that he grew verye rytch, and was in great e&s;timation throughout the whole countrey.</P>
<P>And as cruel murder can neuer lo~g re&s;t vnrewarded. This <HI>Alkatho Al|ley,</HI> the onely mini&s;ter of the Kinges mi&s;chieuous deui&s;e, was in the ende mea&s;ured with &s;uch a lyke mea&s;ure, as he had before meat to the Kings brethren.</P>
<P>Now the cruel king <HI>Mulla Abdula:</HI> among&s;t manye other, taking to his wife a bond woman, that was a <HI>Blacke Negro,</HI> had by her a &s;onne, called <HI>Mulla Sheriffa:</HI> who for that he was of his Mothers complection, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">as co~monly called the <HI>Black King,</HI>

<P><HI>Mulla Hamet,</HI> after the death of his brother <HI>Abdula,</HI> fearing the tyranny of his Blacke Neuew that &s;ucceded him, fled incontinently with all his &s;ub&s;taunce and trea&s;ure, to <HI>Argere,</HI> a Towne belonging to y^<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Turke,</HI> wher he remayned in good &s;afetie.</P>
<P><HI>Mulla Sheriffa,</HI> hauing for a whyle peaceably po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Crowne, be|came in the ende &s;o cruel a tyrant, as his people therfore hating him, mur+mured in their mindes at his great &s;euerity, and in the ende bur&s;t out in plaine &s;peches, &s;aying: that the &s;onne of a bond woman &s;hould not raigne ouer them.</P>
<P><HI>Mulla Hamet,</HI> his Vncle, remaining all this whyle at <HI>Argere,</HI> &amp; vnder&s;ta~|ding how the people were enclined, by the procurement of the mo&s;t part of the Nobility of the Realme: &s;ent to his Brother <HI>Mulla Maluca,</HI> that

<P>With this good hope, <HI>Mulla Malu|ca,</HI> hauing obtayned of the <HI>Turke</HI> (in recompence of his long &s;eruice with him) a band of. 10000. <HI>Turks.</HI> He en|tred with them into <HI>Barbary,</HI> where hee was wyllingly receyued by his friends and fauourers, and greatlie &s;uccoured, a&s;wel by them, as with y^e &s;ub&s;taunce of his brother <HI>Mulla Ha|mer,</HI> who &s;pared nothing to plea|&s;ure him with all, or to further his pre&s;ent enterpri&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Mulla Sheriffa,</HI> his Black Nephew, vnder&s;tanding of his comming: Le|uied a huge Army, to make re&s;p&s;ta~ce again&s;t him: but yet although his power farre &s;urmounted the nu~ber of his enemies, yea: though hee had

<P><HI>Mulla Maluca,</HI> dyd in &s;hort tyme &s;o preuaile again&s;t the &s;ayd <HI>Sheriffa,</HI> as dryuing him to the Mountaynes of the countrey, he obteyned po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Crowne, and euer &s;ynce hath continued king of <HI>Barbary:</HI> where he was well beloued of his people, be|ing a man very actyue, and of great agillitie, &s;kylfull in warres, wherein from his youth he had alwayes ben trayned vp: and as men report, mi|ni&s;tred Iu&s;tice with equitie, much fauouring Chri&s;tians, and &s;pecialie our Nation.</P>
<P>The Blacke king, when he fled in|to the Mountaynes, carryed with him a great parte of the Trea&s;ure of the Countrey, and dayly dy&s;tur|bed the quyet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Vncle <HI>Maluca.</HI> Who &s;lepte not in the

<P>The Kinge of <HI>Portingale</HI> being a lu&s;ty young Gentleman, about. xxiij. yeares of age, peraduenture pricked forwarde by a vaine hope and am|bitious de&s;ire of gaine and glory, not re&s;pecting the perril y^t depe~ded ther vppon: promi&s;ed the &s;ayd <HI>Sheriffa</HI> to performe his de&s;yre therein.

With this power the king
<PB REF="8"> of <HI>Portingale</HI> in his owne per&s;on<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters"> accompanied with a great number of his Nobillitie, departed out of his owne countrey on the .xiiii. day of <HI>Iuly.</HI> 1578. and with his whole fleete fir&s;t ariued at a town in <HI>Spaine</HI> called <HI>Calez:</HI> where he made his a|bode for y^e &s;pace of. viij. whole dayes together, the occa&s;ion whereof was, (as &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e) to furnin&s;h his Ar+mye with all &s;uch things, as &s;hould be needefull for the pro&s;ecution of his preten&s;ed purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>And on the. 22. daye of the fore&s;ayd month of Iuly, he gathered his men together, and with all expedition pa&s;&s;ed fro~ <HI>Calez,</HI> to another Towne lying within the bord<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">rs of <HI>Barba|ry,</HI> called <HI>Tanos:</HI> where hee mett<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> with the Blacke Kings, who had with him, fyue hundreth <HI>Mores</HI> Hor&s;emen.
