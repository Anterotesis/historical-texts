<HEAD>The Authors Preface to the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>IT was the &s;aying of an Antient, That the Spirit of Man affects Novelties, which is ju&s;tified by daily Ob&s;ervation. For any thing to which a man is accu&s;tomed long, commonly grows unplea&s;ant; whereas Variety delights him, and re&s;cues his Imagination from the tediou&s;ne&s;s of ordinary Objects. Hence is the de&s;ire men have naturally to Travaile: and though it withdraws one from his Rela|tions and Country, and expo&s;eth him to &s;everal incommodities and perils, yet the plea&s;ure of his Voiage preponderates all apprehen&s;ions, and renders all di&s;couragements contemptible and vain. And as there is Plea&s;ure in Travailing, &s;o it hath in my judgment its &V;tility like|wi&s;e, and its Profit as well as Diver&s;ion. Of this <HI>Homer</HI> &s;eems to be &s;en&s;ible, when among&s;t all the Elogies and Encomiums he gives to <HI>U|ly&s;&s;es,</HI> one of the principal was, That he had &s;een &s;everal Countries, and made Ob&s;ervation of their Fa&s;hions and Manners. Ever &s;ince I under&s;tood, that the World was not altoge|ther &s;hut up in my own Country, I have had a con&s;tant inclination to travail, and in my travels a curio&s;ity to ob&s;erve (according to my talent) what I thought mo&s;t con&s;iderable. In the Voiage I had the honour to make with the Right Honourable the Earl of <HI>Carli&s;le</HI> du|ring
<PB REF="5">
his Emba&s;&s;ies to <HI>Mo&s;covy, Sweden,</HI> and <HI>Denmark,</HI> I had a particular opportunity to gratify my &s;elf. And, fora&s;much as <HI>Mo&s;covy</HI> is a Country little known, &s;aving to its Neigh|bours, I fixt my de&s;ign there more particularly, and re&s;olved to inform my &s;elf, as exactly as was po&s;&s;ible, of the nature of that Country and its Inhabitants. In the mean time I ob&s;erved al&s;o all the remarkable pa&s;&s;ages of our Travails, but e&s;pecially the pompous &s;olemnities where|with the Amba&s;&s;ador was received: &amp; as I had be&s;ides, the advantage of being imployed about the Negotiation, I neglected nothing of that whereby I might in&s;truct my &s;elf of States-bu&s;ine&s;s. The Voyage being over I put my Me|moires in order, and framed them into a con|tinued di&s;cour&s;e, &s;o that afterwards I had the &s;atisfaction now and then to review all what I had &s;een. I communicated what I had done with &s;ome of my Friends, who found the &s;ubject too good to be buried in oblivion, and wanted not arguments to invite me to Print it. But then I was not yet of that mind, being very careful how I expo&s;ed my &s;elf to the Cen&s;ure of the World, and I took alwaies that enter|prize to be too dangerous and bold: <HI>Nam nulli tacui&s;&s;e nocet, nocet e&s;&s;e locutum.</HI> Yet &s;eeing at last, that I might doe it under my Lord of <HI>Carli&s;les</HI> Protection, and with a full Permi&s;|&s;ion, I thought nothing could excu&s;e me, if I neglected a thing wherein his Excellencies In|terest,
<PB REF="5">
the Publicks, and my own perhaps were concerned.</P>
<P>And accordingly, be&s;ides the General De|&s;cription of the Voyage, and the manner where|with the Amba&s;&s;ador was received, the Reader will find in the Relation of the first Emba&s;&s;y, an exact De&s;cription of <HI>Mo&s;covy,</HI> and of all that pa&s;&s;ed there in his Excellencies Negotia|tion. There I di&s;play the naked truth of the bu&s;ine&s;s, how contrary to the expectations of all <HI>Europe</HI> his Excellency was treated there, after &s;o many effectual te&s;timonies of Friend|&s;hip the King of great <HI>Britain</HI> and the <HI>Tzar</HI> of <HI>Mo&s;covy</HI> had received from one onother. There a man &s;hall &s;ee how unworthily &s;ome of the <HI>Tzars</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners dealt with my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador, and made &s;uch an Emba&s;&s;y fruit|le&s;s, how in&s;tead of taking care for the pre&s;er|vation of that Amity, which for &s;o long time had continued betwixt the Crowns of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Mo&s;covy,</HI> they &s;uffered them&s;elves to be &s;o far tran&s;ported, as to become in&s;trumental in the diminution thereof. And this is clear thorough the whole <HI>Series</HI> of the Negotiation, in which on the one &s;ide there is nothing to be &s;een but a ju&s;t and well grounded deduction of rea&s;ons, tending only to the reinforcement of the antient Alliance: Whereas on the other it is plain their blind intere&s;t had prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them, and that they were contented to be Friends for the future, but upon condition (it
<PB REF="6">
&s;eems) they &s;hould be required no more to give any fair and competent te&s;timonies of their being &s;uch. This is the unexpected humour wherein his Excellency found the Court of <HI>Mo&s;|covy,</HI> who cau&s;le&s;ly di&s;liking his whole manner of proceeding, found fault with tho&s;e very actions which were generous and honourable in him. And indeed, why that Court &s;hould have oppo&s;ed it &s;elf &s;o ob&s;tinately again&s;t his Lord&s;hip, I know no other rea&s;on, but becau&s;e his Lord&s;hip acted with much Zeal and Vigour for the Intere&s;t of the King and his Subjects, and becau&s;e he would not pro&s;titute the dignity of his Office to the ridiculous pride of a <HI>Stol|nick</HI> or a <HI>Boyar,</HI> nor patiently endure &s;everal di&s;obligations in their manner of proceeding. In the Courts of <HI>Sweden</HI> and <HI>Denmark,</HI> du|ring our &s;mall Re&s;idence among&s;t them, it was clear otherwi&s;e: For there his Excellence received all manner of &s;atisfaction, being laden with prai&s;e and honour, and in &s;hort u&s;ed with as much kindne&s;s and re&s;pect as could be ex|pected from two Nations, who&s;e Politene&s;s and &V;rbanity are clear different from the Humour of the <HI>Mo&s;covite;</HI> So that in changing of Cli|mates, we found al&s;o a great difference of Humours. From whence it is ea&s;y to be &s;een, that if the Court of <HI>Mo&s;covy</HI> were not favour|able to my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador, it was only Pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and Intere&s;t which hindered them from making a right e&s;timate both of his
<PB REF="6">
per&s;on and affair: For it is most certain his Excellency employed all imaginable endeavors, and that nothing ob&s;tructed them but a fatal Pertinacity in tho&s;e that treated with him. This being in general the nature and &s;ucce&s;s of the&s;e Emba&s;&s;ies, the fir&s;t makes the greate&s;t part of my hi&s;tory: for the other two Emba&s;&s;ies being &s;peedily performed, affoard but little matter be&s;ides the Complements, which the Amba&s;&s;ador made in the behalf of his Royal Ma&s;ter to the Kings and Queens of <HI>Sweden</HI> and <HI>Denmark.</HI> But the thing that concludes this Work is an Apology, pre&s;ented by his Ex|cellency &s;oon after his return to <HI>London,</HI> a|gain&s;t the preten&s;ions of tho&s;e Amba&s;&s;adors whom the <HI>Tzar</HI> had &s;ent to the King after the fir&s;t Emba&s;&s;y, to complain of his Excellencies comportment in that Court. In this Apology his Lord&s;hip gives for his ju&s;tification a large Narrative of the manner both of his own procee|ding, and of that of the <HI>Mo&s;covites</HI> towards him, to the <HI>Ru&s;s</HI> Amba&s;&s;adors confu&s;ion, who had laid an hainous charge again&s;t him. Thus having given here a general account of the&s;e Emba&s;&s;ies, I leave the peru&s;ing of the whole Work to the Reader: intending to have it &s;hort|ly publi&s;hed al&s;o in <HI>French,</HI> the Copy being now ready for the Pre&s;s.</P>

<PB N="2" REF="10">
among&s;t all the Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI> that, by their congratulations of his Re-e&s;tabli&s;hment, &s;eemed ardently to a&s;pire at His Alliance, the <HI>Tzar</HI> of <HI>Mo&s;covy</HI> had the mo&s;t equitable pre|tentions. For, be&s;ides that admirable Sympathy which has been &s;o long time betwixt the Kings of <HI>England</HI> and the great Dukes of <HI>Mo&s;covy, Alexey Michailovitz</HI> the pre&s;ent Duke had &s;o great an abhorrency of the murther of King CHARLES the Fir&s;t, that he re&s;olved in &s;ome mea&s;ure to revenge it upon the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Company at <HI>Archangel,</HI> whom he looked upon as a&s;&s;ertors if not a&s;&s;ociates in the Rebellion. And as a certain in&s;tance of the con&s;tancy of his affection, he no &s;ooner under&s;tood the calamities Our pre&s;ent King was reduced to, but he a&s;&s;i&s;ted him immediately with a con&s;i|derable &s;um of money. From hence it was that his Maje&s;ty gave his Amba&s;&s;adors &s;o great a Reception, as made the Friend&s;hip he had for that great Monarch con&s;picuous to all the World.</P>
<P>And it was this Emba&s;&s;age from the <HI>Tzar,</HI> and tho&s;e from the Kings of <HI>Sweden</HI> and <HI>Den|mark,</HI> that gave occa&s;ion to his Maje&s;ty of Great <HI>Britain</HI> to return the&s;e, which are the pre&s;ent matter of this Relation: The fir&s;t Em|ba&s;&s;y was addre&s;&s;ed to the Great Duke of <HI>Mo&s;covy,</HI> The &s;econd to the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> The third to the King of <HI>Denmark.</HI> It is true, the fir&s;t had, be&s;ide <HI>That,</HI> a peculiar &s;ubject of
<PB N="3" REF="10">
Importance, touching Commerce at <HI>Archan|gel</HI> in <HI>Mo&s;covie,</HI> viz. <HI>To obtain a re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Priviledges of the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Company, which con&s;i&s;ted in this, That the Merchants of this Kingdom did formerly trade into that place without paying any Impo&s;t.</HI> Which Immunity was but a generous recompence, that one of the former Dukes, <HI>Ivan Ba&s;ilovitz,</HI> made the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> for their di&s;covery of that Port, and introduction of &s;o con&s;iderable a Commerce thither.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Great Duke had vacated the&s;e Priviledges in the time of the late Rebellion in <HI>England,</HI> becau&s;e conceiving the Merchants complices in that rebellion, he e&s;teemed them unworthy of his favour, &amp; therefore of enjoy|ing any longer the&s;e Immunities. The Company having &s;ince that time, to the happy Return of his Maje&s;ty, been deprived of their Privi|ledges, the King by this Emba&s;&s;age de&s;ired things might be re&s;tored to their former &s;tate, and that upon two principal con&s;iderations. One, <HI>becau&s;e his Subjects (for who&s;e rebellion they were taken away,) were returned again to their obedience;</HI> The other, <HI>becau&s;e the&s;e very Priviledges were the ba&s;is and foundation, upon which the Amity betwixt the two Crowns of</HI> England <HI>and</HI> Mo&s;covy <HI>were &s;uper&s;tructed.</HI> And the&s;e were two fundamental Rea&s;ons, that were &s;trong enough to induce his Maje&s;ty to hope for &s;ucce&s;s in his Demand, but he could
<PB N="4" REF="11">
expect no le&s;s from the genero&s;ity and promi&s;e of the <HI>Tzar.</HI> Yet He was flatly refu&s;ed, as if the <HI>Tzars</HI> kindne&s;s had been already quite exhau&s;ted.</P>
<P>The Earle of <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> to whom the King en|charged the&s;e Emba&s;&s;ies was without contra|diction, in all re&s;pects proper for the employ|ment. For, be&s;ides that he was of a comely and advantageous &s;tature, a Maje&s;tick mine, and not above four and thirty years of age, he had a peculiar grace and vivacity in his di&s;cour&s;e, and in his actions a great prompti|tude and diligence. In a word, he was ador|ned with all perfections that could render a man acceptable, and e&s;pecially with tho&s;e that were requi&s;ite for the di&s;charge of &s;o important an affair.</P>
<Q>Gratior e&s;t pulchro veniens &egrave; corpore virtus. <BIBL>Virg.</BIBL></Q>
<P>His Train con&s;i&s;ted of near four&s;core per|&s;ons; among&s;t which he had ten Gentlemen, &s;ix Pages, two Trumpets, and twelve Footmen. He had al&s;o a Chaplain, &s;everal Interpreters, a Chirurgeon, &s;ix Mu&s;icians, be&s;ides many Trade&s;|men that were very nece&s;&s;ary in <HI>Mo&s;covy.</HI> And fora&s;much as his Excellence was to begin that way the circle of his Emba&s;&s;ies, (to the end he might come back by <HI>Liefland</HI> into <HI>Sweden,</HI> by <HI>Sweden</HI> into <HI>Denmark;</HI> and from thence come into <HI>England</HI>) before his departure he provided him&s;elf of all &s;uch nece&s;&s;ary things
<PB N="5" REF="11">
as <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> could &s;carce afford. So that, be&s;ides the <HI>Liveries</HI> which were made at <HI>London,</HI> he was al&s;o forced to provide him&s;elf of Beds &amp; Chairs, and even of all Kitchin-moveables, only the Chimney excepted, and that would have been too mo&s;t &s;erviceable in &s;everal pla|ces. Be&s;ides the&s;e, his Maje&s;ty provided his Excellency with a magnificent Canopy of red Dama&s;k, &s;urrounded with a gold and &s;ilver Fringe, and having on the back in a large circle the Arms of the King of <HI>England,</HI> richly embroidered with &s;ilver, together with a very rich Chair of State having its Foot&s;tool. For other things it is the cu&s;tome of the <HI>Tzar</HI> to defray the charges of all foreign Amba&s;&s;adors from their Entrance into his Dominions, till the time they are out of them.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, all things being thus provided, we prepared to depart in the month of <HI>July</HI> 1663. but before we come to the particular relation of our Voiage, it will not be incongruous to give &s;ome general notions of its extent.</P>
<P>The whole Voiage contained at lea&s;t eigh|teen hundred leagues, that is to &s;ay, upon the Northern Seas betwixt <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Archangel,</HI> &s;even hundred and fifty: from <HI>Archangel</HI> to <HI>Vologda</HI> by water up the Rivers <HI>Duina</HI> and <HI>Sucagna</HI> in <HI>Mo&s;covy,</HI> two hundred and fifty leagues; after that an hundred leagues at lea&s;t from <HI>Vologda</HI> to <HI>Mo&s;co,</HI> by Land. So that the way the Amba&s;&s;ador went, his Voiage
<PB N="6" REF="12">
from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Mo&s;co</HI> (which is the Metro|politan in <HI>Mo&s;covy</HI>) made up eleven hundred leagues. From <HI>Mo&s;co</HI> to <HI>Riga</HI> the principal City in <HI>Livonia,</HI> we travelled two hundred and fifty leagues, the mo&s;t part by Land, which &s;aid Town is under the Dominion of the King of <HI>Sweden.</HI> From <HI>Riga</HI> we pa&s;&s;ed an hundred leagues upon the <HI>Baltick</HI> Sea to <HI>Stockholm,</HI> the capital City in <HI>Swedeland.</HI> From <HI>Stockholm</HI> by Sea al&s;o an hundred leagues more to <HI>Copenhagen</HI> in <HI>Denmark,</HI> where his Excellence concluded his Emba&s;&s;ies. And from thence returning to <HI>London,</HI> he made a Tour at the lea&s;t of two hundred and fifty leagues more.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of our Voiage from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Archangel.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THere were two Ve&s;&s;els appointed for this Voiage: One, a Man of war of 50. pieces of Ordnance, The other a Merchants &s;hip; which la&s;t &s;et &s;ayle before the other with twenty two of his Lord&s;hips Dome&s;ticks, of which number I was one. A great part of his baggage, and of the Pre&s;ents his Maje&s;ty &s;ent to the great Duke, were di&s;po&s;ed in this Ve&s;&s;el al&s;o, be&s;ides eight Coach hor&s;es. In this manner we embarked from <HI>London</HI> for <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> where our &s;hip lay at anchor in
<PB N="7" REF="12">
the <HI>Thames,</HI> with the Man of war, in which the Amba&s;&s;ador was to come after us very &s;hortly.</P>
<P>But after we were embarked, there was an unlucky accident befel one of our Company, who fell down upon the hatches, and hurt him&s;elf in &s;everal places of his body; &s;o that we thought fit to get him carried immediately a&s;hore into <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> where he found him|&s;elf &s;o ill, that we concluded his journey would be at an end before it was well begun. This per&s;on was of the number of them to whom the genero&s;ity of the Amba&s;&s;ador had given leave to tran&s;port them&s;elves for <HI>Mo&s;|covie,</HI> and to cro&s;s tho&s;e Countries with his Train. His Excellence being arrived at <HI>Grave&s;|end</HI> in order to his embarkment, received him into his Ve&s;&s;el, where in a &s;hort time he reco|vered &s;o well, that he made a match with one of the Maid-&s;ervants, and &s;o gave us af|terwards the entertainment of a Marriage at <HI>Mo&s;co.</HI> However this fall proved to be but a happy fall, fora&s;much as by that means he leapt out of a Merchants &s;hip into one of the King's Men of war well provided, and much happier in this Voiage than ours. There they were entertained all the way with the &s;ound of Trumpets, and the melody of Mu&s;ick, whil&s;t we (Strangers to all the&s;e diverti&s;e|ments) had no other harmony than what is ordinarily concomitant with the &s;ickne&s;s of
<PB N="8" REF="13">
the Sea; in which the mo&s;t of us bore our parts.</P>
<P>On the 15^t^h^. of <HI>July</HI> we &s;et &s;ayle from <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> with a favourable gale to fall down the River. But &s;hortly after the wind turned &s;o cro&s;s and violent, that for the &s;pace of &s;even or eight days we were all in a very &s;ad and di&s;mal con&s;ternation, and tho&s;e chiefly who were but &s;trangers to the&s;e confu&s;ions as yet. It is true we had now and then a little calm weather, and chiefly the 21. which gave us the opportunity of entertaining our &s;elves with the &s;ight of a Porpoi&s;e of an exceeding bigne&s;s, for a full quarter of an hour. She gave us great diver&s;ion with her con&s;tant plungings and leapings in the water, on each &s;ide of our Ship, as if &s;he had come on purpo&s;e to make us that Recreati|on. But, as if all that had been but &s;o many pre&s;ages of a grievous Storm, and a Progno|&s;tication of cro&s;&s;es impending us, pre&s;ently after the wind was at North-Ea&s;t, which was directly contrary and continued there four days with a very great violence. And &s;o that Sea, which in the calm appeared like an azure field, wherein the fi&s;hes &s;ported them&s;elves with the wanton expre&s;&s;ions of their joy, on a &s;udden became a place of horror, of mountains, and aby&s;&s;es, combating one ano|ther by the violence of the winds, the foaming waves to&s;&s;ing up our Ve&s;&s;el to the clouds,
<PB N="9" REF="13">
and in an in&s;tant re-plunging it in the bottom of the Sea; and the Ocean after &s;o plea&s;ant a calm bellowing and roaring with incredible fury &s;o long a time together.</P>
<P>At la&s;t we came in &s;ight of <HI>Norway,</HI> and here we &s;ollicited the Ma&s;ter to go to an harbour which was in &s;ight of us, and &s;tay there till the wind &s;erved. But he refu&s;ed it, alledging in his excu&s;e, that he came out very late from <HI>England</HI> to make &s;o long a Voiage, that it was un&s;ea&s;onable to divert our &s;elves with recre|ations a&s;hore, that he was obliged to keep him&s;elf at Sea as much as was po&s;&s;ible, &s;o that he might be ready to make his advantage of the fir&s;t favourable wind. By all which we quickly di&s;cerned that we had not to do with an <HI>Ace&s;&s;aeus,</HI> who was alwaies coyning of pretences to delay his voiage, and quarrel|ling the Moon that &s;he was no more propi|tious to his Navigation. Our Ma&s;ter on the contrary would anticipate his oppotunities, and re&s;olved however to manage his Ve&s;&s;el in &s;pight of the inclemency of the Heavens. He was an old Sea-man, &s;o accu&s;tomed to the air of the Sea, that he &s;carce &s;ub&s;i&s;ted but on Shipboord, and never lived but by compul|&s;ion on &s;hore. Which made one &s;ay, That he feared le&s;t the Ma&s;ter being become by cu&s;tom an <HI>Amphibium</HI> already, &s;hould at la&s;t degene|rate into &s;ome Sea-mon&s;ter; and that if he had lived in the time of the antient Pagans,
<PB N="10" REF="14">
when the Gods transformed Men and Women into Stones, Trees, and Birds, it would have been no hard matter to have Metamorphi&s;ed him at lea&s;t into a Man-fi&s;h, his di&s;po&s;ition contributing &s;o much thereunto.</P>
<P>The 26. the wind increa&s;ed with &s;uch fury, that it blew down and brake in pieces the &s;cuttle of our main Ma&s;t, tore our main Sayle, and &s;prung one of our ma&s;ts, &s;o that it hung loo&s;e among the Tackling. At fir&s;t this di&s;|a&s;ter was very dreadful, but we turned it pre&s;ently into an occa&s;ion of joy: intermin|gling with the common apprehen&s;ion of ex|traordinary danger, a &s;ecret hope of being for &s;ome time delivered from the importunity of the Sea. And indeed the Ma&s;ter him&s;elf who&s;e great refractorine&s;s had carried us into &s;o many extremities, di&s;po&s;ed him&s;elf at la&s;t to &s;trike &s;ayl to the tempe&s;t, and turning to the We&s;t, we &s;tood in for <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> to repair our Ship which the &s;torm had reduced to a very ill condition. Upon which nothing was to be &s;een among&s;t us but tran&s;portation and joy, every body ble&s;&s;ing God for the con&s;o|lation we had drawn out of this accident, and in a moment forgetting our &s;orrows that were pa&s;t, we plea&s;ed our &s;elves as much that we were making for <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> though it was &s;ixty leagues backward, as if we had been arriving at <HI>Archangel,</HI> and ready to put an end to a terrible and a tedious Voiage. But,</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="14">About noon the next day the wind having done its wor&s;t, left us as it were &s;tanding &s;till, a calm, after we had di&s;covered the moun|tains of <HI>Cheviot</HI> in <HI>Scotland.</HI> At length about the Evening we had a South-We&s;t wind, which &s;erved only to inveigle us further into the fury of the &s;ame wind that had &s;o per|plexed us already, and expo&s;e us afre&s;h to the &s;ame dangers we had almo&s;t overcome. For though it was but a little gale, yet the Ma&s;ter and Pilot puft up with in&s;ignificant hope, thought it be&s;t to make advantage of &s;o rare an occa&s;ion, per&s;wading them&s;elves by the opinion of their Carpenters, that their &s;cuttle and ma&s;t might be mended well enough at Sea, to hold out to <HI>Archangel.</HI> In&s;omuch as they peremptorily re&s;olved, to turn their backs upon <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> and addre&s;s them&s;elves once more to their Voiage to <HI>Mo&s;covy.</HI> So that having made near &s;ixty leagues in le&s;s than four and twenty houres, and being come within &s;ix or &s;even leagues of the &s;hore, here we &s;aw by a &s;ad di&s;appointment the end of our joy, and the fruit of our expectations. And</P>
<P>The next morning the wind turned North-Ea&s;t again, with its old impetuo&s;ity and rage, as if it had retreated only to redouble its force. The Ma&s;ter, far from looking out any refuge, imployed his Carpenters all this while about his &s;cuttle and ma&s;t. Whereupon, being
<PB N="12" REF="15">
all very impatient of our condition, and find|ing our &s;elves &s;laves to the brutality of an in&s;upportable per&s;on, that delighted him&s;elf as it were, to make us a &s;port to the winds, expo&s;ing altogether to the mercy of the &s;torms in a &s;hattered brui&s;ed Ve&s;&s;el our lives, His Maje&s;ties and his Amba&s;&s;adors goods, two of his Excellencies Gentlemen among&s;t the re&s;t of our Company expo&s;tulated with him boldly, and prote&s;ted his rude proceeding &s;hould not go unpuni&s;hed. But all this would not move him, Rigour having no better an effect upon him than good Nature. This &s;on of the Sea forbore not &s;till for &s;ome time to exerci&s;e our patience by the enraged Ocean, that &s;eemed to threaten the very Heavens them&s;elves. At la&s;t, on the 29. the weather befriended us with as favourable an accident as befel us before, for the Bolt-&s;prit being loo&s;e, the Ma&s;ter made pre&s;ently what &s;ayle he could for <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> which was then &s;ome fifty leagues from us. But the wind con&s;trai|ned us twenty leagues further, and we were glad the next day to put into <HI>Burlington,</HI> a Harbour in the County of <HI>York.</HI> There we were no &s;ooner come to an anchor, but we went immediately on &s;hore to refre&s;h and take &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary repo&s;e after &s;o great incommodities at Sea.</P>
<P>In the mean time, while we &s;taid in this Harbour till our Ship was repaired, Mr. <HI>Wat|&s;on,</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="15" MS="y">
a Gentleman who had the direction of our Company, was commanded away by General <HI>Monck</HI> upon occa&s;ion of a new Mutiny of Fanaticks in <HI>Yorke&s;hire,</HI> which was &s;oon after happily &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, &s;everal of the Mutineers having been executed. This Re|bellion we heard of a&s;&s;oon as we came to the Harbour; and Mr. <HI>Wat&s;on,</HI> who had a mili|tary Command in his Maje&s;ties Guards, was therefore advi&s;ed by a friend of his Sir <HI>Thomas Gower,</HI> then High Sherif of <HI>Yorke&s;hire</HI> (whom he met with) to acquaint &s;peedily General <HI>Monck</HI> with his being at <HI>Burlington,</HI> that in ca&s;e the General &s;hould have had occa&s;ion for him in that conjuncture he might receive his commands. Mr. <HI>Wat&s;on</HI> followed this ad|vice, and writ accordingly to the General, though indeed he was very loth to break off his Voiage, and to undergo after &s;o many troubles the fru&s;tration of the de&s;ire he had to &s;ee particularly the Country of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> whereunto nothing had engaged him but his own curio&s;ity. At length having received no an&s;wer at the return of the Po&s;t, the wind being turned fair, and our Ship being &s;uffici|ently repaired, he prepared him&s;elf for his embarkment with us, rather than wait any longer for an an&s;wer to the prejudice of the Amba&s;&s;adors affaires. But ju&s;t as he was put|ting his foot, as it were, into the boat, he re|ceived Orders from General <HI>Monck</HI> to return
<PB N="18" REF="16">
immediately to <HI>London</HI> about his military Office. Whereupon he came aboard our Ship, and having writ an account of the bu&s;ine&s;s to the Amba&s;&s;ador he was reconveyed on &s;hore, to the great di&s;&s;atisfaction of all our Company. And &s;o, having &s;taid nine whole days at <HI>Bur|lington,</HI></P>
<P>The 8. of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> we &s;ailed away for <HI>Arch|angel,</HI> reduced to a le&s;&s;er number by three or four per&s;ons. From thence the weather was &s;o favourable, that whereas before we had &s;pent three weeks and three days making but four|&s;core leagues, we fini&s;hed our Voiage within a &s;mall matter in the &s;ame proportion of time.</P>
<P>It is true we had not above eight or nine days of fair wind, but it was &s;o propitious, that in five days (from the 11. of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> to the 16.) we made near four hundred leagues. The 12. we left <HI>Shetland</HI> to the leeward, and the next day we had &s;o great a &s;torm, that one of our Yards was broken in the middle, and we compelled to &s;lacken our &s;ailes. How|ever we reckoned this tempe&s;t benign, as long as it did contribute to the good expe|dition of our Voiage.</P>
<P>The 20. and 21. were &s;o foggy that we could &s;carce di&s;cern one another upon the Decks; whereas, when the weather was cleer, we had &s;o little darkne&s;s, that from Sun &s;etting to Sun ri&s;ing it &s;eemed a continual Twy-light. Neverthele&s;s, about this time we began to be

very much incommoded with cold, which brought our &s;trong-waters into very great re|que&s;t among us, e&s;pecially after we had on the 22. di&s;covered the I&s;les of <HI>Ru&s;t</HI> and <HI>Grom&s;ond</HI> all covered over with &s;now.</P>
<P>The 26. &s;ayling South-Ea&s;t, we pa&s;t on to|wards the <HI>North-Cape,</HI> having left &s;everal Mountainous I&s;lands to the windward of us, and coa&s;ting for &s;ome time along <HI>Capland,</HI> we came in few days upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Lap|land.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;econd of September we had the diver|ti&s;ement to &s;ee our &s;elves &s;urrounded by great numbers of Fi&s;h, &s;olacing and &s;porting in the calm; and though according to the judge|ment of our Sea-men, and the experience we had often had, it was ordinarily a pre&s;age of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll weather, yet to us it appeared that we were not capable of a more acceptable entertain|ment amid&s;t the delays of a calm: and here it was we di&s;covered a great Whale, playing in the Sea &s;ome two or three leagues off us. About noon we had a gentle gale that gave us a &s;ight of the Emba&s;&s;adors Frigat, by which we un|der&s;tood his Excellence was long &s;ince arrived at <HI>Archangel,</HI> that he was per&s;waded we were ca&s;t away, and re&s;olved, if he had no news of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s before, to begin his journey for <HI>Vologda</HI> the 8. of <HI>September.</HI></P>
<P>As this news (which we received but by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, as the Frigat was returning into <HI>England</HI>)
<PB N="20" REF="17">
gave us no &s;mall joy on the one &s;ide, &s;o on the other, it was a great trouble to find our &s;elves &s;ixty leagues from our Port, expo&s;ed to the fury of a wind, that was already rallying its for|ces to beat us back, and did effectually repel us, &s;o as</P>
<P>The next day we were obliged to ca&s;t anchor towards the point of <HI>Orlogones,</HI> for the more certain eva&s;ion of the Rocks and Sand-banks that encompa&s;t us. In the mean time, five or &s;ix of our men, and as many Seamen, made a a party to go on &s;hore, and &s;ee how that coun|try was inhabited, and expecting to meet &s;tore of wild bea&s;ts, among&s;t other weapons they took their fire Arms al&s;o. They &s;tayed on &s;hore about five or &s;ix hours, but &s;o incommo|ded with the coldne&s;s of the wind, that they were con&s;trained to cut down a wooden cro&s;s, (they found newly erected near the &s;ea &s;ide) to make a fire therewith to warm them&s;elves: the remainder of which they brought along with them aboard to do as much for us; for we had already con&s;umed almo&s;t all our &s;eacoals. They brought us al&s;o a Bottle of fre&s;h water, as &s;weet as liquorice, which they had from a Rock near the &s;ea &s;ide, which the Ma&s;ter lik'd &s;o well, he re&s;olved the next day to fill two or three Tun with it, for that mo&s;t of our water was corrupted.</P>
<P>The 4. the wind turned, but we e&s;capt very narrowly being wreckt. For, a little after mid|night,
<PB N="21" REF="17">
as we were weighing anchor, in the mid&s;t of the tempe&s;t and rain, we found our &s;elves violently forced among the Rocks by the fury of the Sea, and the Tide driving us inevitably on ground; in&s;omuch, as the Ma&s;ter di&s;pairing to get the &s;hip off, with a mo&s;t lamentable voice cryed out, <HI>All is lo&s;t.</HI> His rocky heart at la&s;t melted at the &s;ight of tho&s;e Rocks that en|vironed us, and he whom the mo&s;t outragious &s;urges of the Sea could not terrifie, trembled then at the &s;ight of a Rock; in&s;omuch, as to have &s;een him then, one would have thought no body had been in danger but he, &s;o &s;trange|ly was he &s;urpri&s;ed with amazement and de&s;|pair. And now it was, every one put his af|fairs into order, and he being in expectation every moment of da&s;hing in pieces, and give|ing us the alarm, mo&s;t of us prepared our &s;elves to &s;wim, if we could to Land, which was not far from us. For my part, I took up <HI>&V;ly&s;&s;es</HI> Re|&s;olution, who being almo&s;t in the &s;ame condi|tion, thought it be&s;t to keep in his &s;hip, till it was broke in pieces, &amp; then (&s;aid he) when the Waves have de&s;troyed my Ve&s;&s;el, will be the be&s;t time for me to &s;wim, for then a man has nothing el&s;e to mind. But God Almighty de|livered us from this de&s;perate extremity, &s;o that having with much labour weighed An|chor, we cleered our &s;elves beyond all expe|ctation, &amp; doubling the point of <HI>Orlogones,</HI> we made forty leagues that day upon the white

&s;ea, and that evening we came up as high as <HI>Cat&s;no&s;e,</HI> which we left to the lee-ward.</P>
<P>The 5. of <HI>Septemb.</HI> was the day whereon we arrived happily at <HI>Archangel;</HI> but before we got in, we ran a great hazard at the Bar of <HI>Arch|angel,</HI> where the Duina di&s;-imbogues it &s;elf: and where we &s;aw a <HI>Holland</HI> Merchant man that was newly wreckt there.

During which time, the ma&s;ter with another Gentleman went on &s;hore to <HI>Archangel,</HI> to give his Excellence no|tice of our arrivall. The tide coming in, the &s;hip that lay but lightly upon the ground, was di&s;-ingaged in that manner, that we all arrived at <HI>Archangel</HI> in three hours, where we were recived by our companions with all imaginable joy: &s;o that it was no ea&s;ie matter to determine which &s;ide thought it &s;elf mo&s;t happy, we, who were arrived, or they, that we were &s;o.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Amba&s;&s;adors Voyage, and of his Entry into the Town of <HI>Archangel.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IF our Voyage was full of troubles and di&s;|a&s;ters, I dare on the other &s;ide affirm, there was &s;carce ever any &s;o happy as the Amba&s;|&s;adors. For without mentioning the advan|tage and convenience of his &s;hip, I &s;hall only relate, that whereas we &s;pent &s;even compleat weeks betwixt <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Archangel,</HI> his Excellencie made the whole Voyage of &s;even hundred and fifty leagues, in le&s;s than a moneth: for, having &s;et &s;aile from <HI>Grave&s;end</HI> the 22. of <HI>July</HI> which was eight daies after us, he arrived the 19. of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> at the Barr of <HI>Archangel,</HI> which was &s;eventeen daies be|fore us. And there it was his Frigat came fir&s;t to an anchor, in expectation of Orders for his Entry, for which rea&s;on he &s;ent Mr. <HI>Marvel</HI> his Secretary into the Town. Of who&s;e land|ing, the Governour having notice, ordered him to be conducted by &s;ix Gentlemen to the Ca&s;tle, through a Regiment of &s;ix hundred men, and the next day he &s;ent &s;ixteen boats, guarded by &s;everal hundreds of men, under the command of a Collonel, to receive his Ex|cellence, and bring him a&s;hore.</P>
<P>The Amba&s;&s;adors Entry into <HI>Archangel</HI> was made the 23. in a remarkable manner:
<PB N="24" REF="19">
For, be&s;ides the &s;ixteen boats which were &s;ent to attend upon the Amba&s;&s;ador, there was a Barque particularly trim'd for his Ex|cellence, be&s;ides <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">veral others dre&s;t up with Tape&s;try, that came to meet him, and accom|pany him to the Town above halfe a league, whil&s;t &s;everal &s;hips, men of War and Mer|chant-men, both of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> for|bore not to congratulate his Entry with the noi&s;e of their Canon, which is not much in u&s;e among&s;t the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> unle&s;s in their wars. And ju&s;t as his Excellence was landing, upon a wooden bridg, he was prevented by a certain Collonel, called <HI>Bogdan,</HI> who came to complement him, according to their mode, and to declare him&s;elf deputed to attend him as <HI>Pri&s;taffe</HI> (which is the Title they give &s;uch as are appointed to receive foreign Amba&s;&s;a|dors, and to take care of their pa&s;&s;age and provi&s;ions) The Amba&s;&s;ador having replied to him very hand&s;omely, began to advance towards the lodging which was prepared for him: but as he was &s;etting the fir&s;t &s;tep, the <HI>Pri&s;taff</HI> took the upper hand of him. And this was an in&s;tance of the great rudene&s;s and in&s;olence of the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> (of which we &s;hall have future occa&s;ion to &s;peak more largely) which is the ordinary method they u&s;e to tho&s;e Amba&s;&s;adors, upon whom they de&s;ign any advantage: &s;o as they beleeve, they do their Prince a manife&s;t injurie, if they do
<PB N="25" REF="19">
not in his name treat them uncivilly. But his Excellence being re&s;olved to teach them the dignity of his Character, &s;topt him&s;elf imme|diately, and turning to the <HI>Pri&s;taff,</HI> remon|&s;trated to him the incivility of his carri|age, telling him in the&s;e words, That he had received great civilities till then, but that he could by no means give him that advantage, which was due to him&s;elf, That he was &s;ent from his Maje&s;tie of Great <HI>Britain</HI> to the Emperour, to do him all po&s;&s;ible honour, but it was without derogating from him&s;elf, and much le&s;s from the King his Ma&s;ter. Thereupon <HI>Bogdan,</HI> in &s;ome perplexitie, ex|cu&s;ed him&s;elf, by alledging the Orders he had received from the Governour to that purpo&s;e, and entreated his Excellence to make a little &s;tay: In the mean time, he di&s;patched away a Me&s;&s;enger to the Governour, to give him notice how unluckily his De&s;ign had &s;ucceed|ed, and continued bare-headed all the while (till the me&s;&s;enger returned) though his Excellence was covered. At length the dif|ference was decided, to the advantage of the Amba&s;&s;ador, who was immediately conduct|ed to his Lodging, where the <HI>Pri&s;taff</HI> with great Apology, made him a liberal offer of all things nece&s;&s;ary for his family.</P>
<P>And this is all I have to &s;ay concerning the manner of our Entry. However, before I de|&s;cribe
<PB N="26" REF="20">
the Circum&s;tances of our abode at <HI>Archangel,</HI> and the &s;ucce&s;s of our journey cro&s;s the Country to <HI>Mo&s;co,</HI> I think it not impertinent to give a Relation of the Coun|try it &s;elf, and the Inhabitants; to the end that the Readers, being pre-in&s;tructed in the&s;e two points, the manner of our Voyage may be more ea&s;ily comprehended.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The de&s;cription of <HI>Mo&s;covie.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Mo&s;covie</HI> is properly but the name of a Province &s;o called, of which <HI>Mo&s;co</HI> is the chief City. But as <HI>France</HI> communicates its name to all the Provinces under that Do|minion, &s;o by <HI>Mo&s;covie</HI> are ordinarily under|&s;tood all the Provinces united under the Obedience of the <HI>Czar.</HI> This Country is a part of the <HI>Europaean Sarmatia,</HI> whereof the Antients make mention; which is otherwi&s;e called <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> or <HI>Roxolania,</HI> and from thence comes the name of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians,</HI> which is given to the <HI>Mo&s;covites.</HI></P>
<P>This Empire which is doubtle&s;s the great|e&s;t of all <HI>Europe,</HI> extends it &s;elf Northward to the frozen Sea, beyond the <HI>Artique</HI> Circle; Ea&s;tward it is terminated by the River <HI>Oby;</HI> Southwards by the <HI>Crim Tartars</HI> and <HI>Precopia;</HI> And on the We&s;t by <HI>Livonia, Poland,</HI> and <HI>Swedland.</HI> So that in its whole extent, as well
<PB N="27" REF="20">
in <HI>A&s;ia</HI> as <HI>Europe,</HI> it comprehends thirty de|grees, which is near &s;ix hundred leagues; and in its Latitude &s;ixteen, which is above three hundred.</P>
<P>This Country is generally flat, in which Nature has taken delight, as it were, to put the Trees in aray, and to beautifie it with &s;eve|ral Lakes and Rivers. And in truth, <HI>Mo&s;covie</HI> from one end to the other, is in a manner no|thing but a continual Fore&s;t, irrigated by &s;everal Lakes and Rivers, which render it incomparably plea&s;ant and beautiful. Among&s;t others, there is <HI>Volga,</HI> &s;ometimes called <HI>Rha,</HI> and which the <HI>Tartars</HI> at pre&s;ent call <HI>Edel,</HI> without exception the fine&s;t River in <HI>Europe.</HI> It takes its &s;ource in the Province of <HI>Ro&s;covie,</HI> from a Lake called <HI>Fronow,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ing &s;ome few leagues beyond into another called <HI>Vol|go,</HI> it takes its name from that Lake, and di&s;|imbogues near <HI>A&s;tracan</HI> into the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, Where it divides <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> So as from its head, to the place where it falls into the <HI>Ca&s;pian,</HI> is a tract of a thou&s;and leagues at lea&s;t, receiving mo&s;t of the Rivers in <HI>Mo&s;covie,</HI> as it goes along, which inlarge it &s;o, that, as <HI>Olearius</HI> mentions in his Relation, it is not far from <HI>Nice,</HI> four thou&s;and &s;ix hundred Geome|trical feet broad.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bori&s;thenes</HI> al&s;o, which parts <HI>Lituania</HI> and <HI>Mo&s;covie,</HI> is very con&s;iderable; which ri&s;eth in <HI>Ro&s;covie</HI> al&s;o, and di&s;chargeth it &s;elf
<PB N="28" REF="21">
into the <HI>Euxin</HI> Sea. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there is <HI>Duina</HI> which receiveth the <HI>Con&s;lans, Jagel,</HI> and <HI>Sucagna,</HI> and ca&s;ts it &s;elf into the <HI>White</HI> Sea, &s;ome &s;ix or &s;eaven leagues from <HI>Archangel.</HI> There is another <HI>Duina</HI> al&s;o, which ri&s;eth &s;ome leagues off of the <HI>Nieper</HI> or <HI>Bori&s;thenes,</HI> in a Lake that gives it its name, and falls into the <HI>Baltique</HI> about four leagues from <HI>Riga.</HI> The <HI>Oby,</HI> which di&s;charges it &s;elf into the <HI>Frozen</HI> Sea, and takes its &s;ource from the Lake <HI>Catai&s;co,</HI> is &s;o broad at the mouth, they mu&s;t have a very good wind that cro&s;s it in a day. I could &s;peak al&s;o of <HI>Mo&s;ca</HI> and <HI>Occa,</HI> con&s;iderable Rivers, and of &s;everal others this Country is well provided with; but it &s;hall be &s;ufficient at pre&s;ent to &s;ay, that for the mo&s;t part they lo&s;e them&s;elves in the Rivers above-named. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there is &s;o great a number of Brooks, Pools, and Lakes, one can &s;carce pa&s;s four or five leagues without &s;eeing &s;ome great collection of Water.</P>
<P><HI>Mo&s;covie</HI> being &s;cituat in &s;o cold a Climat, no wonder if the Winters be very long there, and the Fro&s;ts exceeding violent, e&s;pecially in the mo&s;t Northerly Provinces. About <HI>Mo&s;co,</HI> where the weather is more temperate, the Winter takes not up above &s;ix or &s;even moneths in the year: but on the Ea&s;tern, and Northern &s;ides of the Country, particu|larly in the Province of <HI>Petzora,</HI> that runs
<PB N="29" REF="21">
along by the <HI>Frozen</HI> Sea, their Winters are &s;o long, that their Rivers which begin to thaw but in <HI>May,</HI> freez again before <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> is pa&s;t. And although tho&s;e Provinces towards the South &s;hould &s;eem in rea&s;on to be more mild, they are notwith&s;tanding &s;o &s;ubject to violent Cold, that one &s;hall meet with men upon the Road benum'd ordinarily, who (though their whole body perhaps be not &s;tupified) yet there is nothing more common, if they have not extraordinary care, than to have their Eares, their Lips, their Hands, or their No&s;es frozen. In &s;hort, the Colds there are great to that degree, that they many times become in&s;uperable by any exerci&s;e of the body, and cleave the very Earth as much as a Drought. The Rivers, the Lakes, the Sea it felt is frozen, and as at that time they &s;eem to have changed their Natures, they change al&s;o their Cu&s;tomes. One may &s;ee there a River &s;o frozen in four and twenty hours, that one may pa&s;s over dry foot, and without doubt the abundance of Water that contri|butes to the Fro&s;t, mu&s;t needs make the Aire more bitter, and the Winter more fierce.</P>
<P>From thence it comes to pa&s;s, that <HI>Mo&s;covie</HI> is exempt from Epidemical di&s;ea&s;es, their bodies being more robu&s;t, and more vigorous than in the hot Countries, where they are more &s;ubject to di&s;tempers. True it is, the Heats in the Summer are &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, that
<PB N="30" REF="22">
(as it is commonly reported in that Country) even the Fir-trees are &s;ometimes &s;et on fire by the Sun. Neverthele&s;s, the Nights are &s;o fre&s;h and coole, that in the moneth of <HI>July,</HI> we had Fro&s;ts, though the Days had been &s;weltry and in&s;upportable. But that which is much more trouble&s;ome than the Heat, is the Clouds of In&s;ects, of Wa&s;ps, and other Flies, ingendred by the Sun in the Pooles and Mar&s;hes, which give a perpetual per&s;ecu|tion to them that travel.</P>
<P>For Aliment, nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of Man, <HI>Mo&s;covie</HI> produces &s;o good, and in that quantity, that it yeelds not to the be&s;t country in <HI>Europe.</HI> They have Gra&s;s and Corn in that abundance, that they know not which way to con&s;ume it, for which cau&s;e here it is the <HI>Hollander</HI> makes his provi&s;ion of corn yearly. Their Seed time is not before <HI>May,</HI> though about <HI>Mo&s;co</HI> and the Provinces adjacent, the fields are open ordinarily in <HI>April,</HI> or the end of <HI>March:</HI> The great Fro&s;ts they have in the Winter, make them give the Earth more lei&s;ure to thaw, yet that hinders not but they have their Harve&s;t before <HI>Augu&s;t.</HI> For the great heat of the Day, which is eighteen hours long, and the fre&s;hne&s;s of the Night, which with plentiful dews waters the Corn, thru&s;ts it up immediately, and in a &s;hort time brings it to maturity. They have very good Beef, but their Mutton (e&s;pecially about <HI>Arch|angel</HI>)
<PB N="31" REF="22">
is but indifferent. They have great &s;tore of Deer, Wild-bores, and Elkes, but principally of Hares, which are gray all Sum|mer, and in Winter as white as Snow: Phe|&s;ants, Partridges, Wood-pigeons, Wood-cocks, Duck, and Mallard, Gee&s;e, Quailes, and Pigeons are very plentiful, and by con|&s;equence cheap. Their Forre&s;ts are well furni&s;hed with &s;mall Birds al&s;o, as Thru&s;hes, Larkes, and Feldifere; but having enough of others, they do not &s;pend their time in taking of them. There are al&s;o about <HI>Arch|angel</HI> &s;ome Birds of prey white all over. And if the Forre&s;ts befriend them with &s;uch vari|ety of Game, their Rivers, Lakes, and Pools are no le&s;s bountiful in their Fi&s;h: In the <HI>Volga,</HI> they have a kind of Sturgeon, of who&s;e Eggs they make an excellent Ragout, which they call <HI>Ikari,</HI> and the <HI>Italians Cavayar,</HI> which affords a con&s;iderable Trade in tho&s;e Parts, and the Czar keeps it to him&s;elf: They put their Eggs into Pa&s;te, and (having prepared them with Salt ten or twelve days) they eat them like a Sallad with Vinegar, oyl of Olives, Pepper, and Onions, They have all kind of Pul&s;e, and Pot-hearbs, yet it is not long &s;ince Sallades and A&s;paragas were in fa&s;hion in <HI>Mo&s;co;</HI> and &s;ince Flowers and &s;trong Hearbs were tran&s;planted thither. Onions and Garlick are &s;o common among&s;t them, e&s;pecially in their Lents, that one needs
<PB N="32" REF="23">
go no further than his No&s;e for information. They have great quantities of Melons, Cucum|bers, and Gourds, and we were a&s;&s;ured, that (like tho&s;e which <HI>Olearius</HI> mentions of the figure of a Lamb) they change their place as they grow, that they dry up the Gra&s;s which way &s;oever they turn, and that when ripe, the &s;tock dies, and that the fruit being covered with a certain velvet on the rinde, the &s;ame with a little preparation is made &s;er|viceable as Furrs. And the&s;e kind of Gourds are frequently had near <HI>Samara,</HI> betwixt the <HI>Volga</HI> and the <HI>Doa.</HI> They have no want of Apples, Plums, or Cherries, but they have no Walnut-trees, or &s;uch Fruit as require a long|er and more moderate heat. They have good &s;tore of fair Straw-berries, and in <HI>Autumn</HI> a certain red Goo&s;-berry, that grows flat upon the ground. They have Mulberries al&s;o, and Ra&s;berries, and Honey in that abundance, that they gather it as they pa&s;s along the Woods. All which being con&s;idered together, with their va&s;t numbers of Cattle, one may well &s;ay, That this al&s;o is a Countrey flowing with Milk and Honey. Of this Honey they make a great proportion of Wax, &s;o as be&s;ide what they con&s;ume in their Torches, Candles, and Lamps, they utter yearly near twenty thou&s;and Quintals to Strangers. Of this Honey it is they make their Mead, which they call <HI>Mioude,</HI> a very common drink among&s;t them. They
<PB N="33" REF="23">
make it of raw Honey, beaten in warm water, which, when they have &s;tirred up and down a long time with a &s;tick, they cover, and let it &s;tand twelve hours: then boyling and &s;cum|ing it, they &s;train it thorow a cloath, and it is made. They have al&s;o another &s;ort that is red, which is excellent with Straw-berries, Cherries, Mulberries, or Ra&s;ps, and is pre|pared with more curio&s;itie and ingredients. Be&s;ides this, the Ordinary People drink <HI>Quaz,</HI> which is a kind of &s;mall Beer, and not unplea&s;ant. The better Sort make them&s;elves a kind of &s;trong Beer, which they keep in their Snow-hou&s;es all the Summer. True it is, they have no Vines, yet by the Courte&s;ie of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Hollander,</HI> they are every year &s;o well provided with Wine and &s;trong Wa|ters, that they have no want either of the one or the other.</P>
<P>Stone being a Rarity in <HI>Mo&s;covie,</HI> and Wood &s;o plentiful, there are few Hou&s;es but what are built of Wood; which I ob&s;erved to have two conveniences: One is, that they are warmer than Stone, the Other, that they are cheaper. But withal, they have this di&s;|advantage, that they are more obnoxious to the Element of Fire, which is &s;o outragious &s;ometimes, that it devoures a whole Town at a blow. And hence it is their Hou&s;es are very rude, without any fa&s;hion or art, being only &s;o many pieces of Firr piled up one a|bove
<PB N="34" REF="24">
another, and Mo&s;s &s;tuft in betwixt them, their Windows very &s;mall, and their Roofs of bark of Trees, covered over &s;ometimes with Turf. So that (their Stoves excepted, which they u&s;e to warm their Chambers with, in the &s;everity of the Winter) they do almo&s;t follow the Di&s;cipline of <HI>Lycurgus,</HI> who would have the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> build with no other In&s;truments, than the Hatchet and Saw. They are generally low, and tho&s;e of the Pe&s;ants, not of above one or two Rooms at the mo&s;t, in which the Father, Mother, Chil|dren, Hogs, and Hens lie all together. They have for the mo&s;t part no Chimneys, in&s;omuch as when they make u&s;e of their Stoves, the &s;moak goes out &s;till at the Windows. Ano|ther Remedy the <HI>Mu&s;covits</HI> have again&s;t the mi&s;chief of fire, is the mi&s;erable furniture of their Hou&s;es, which is &s;o contemptible, that in any &s;uch accident, they can lo&s;e nothing with their Lodgings, but their Di&s;hes and Spoons, which are made of Earth or Wood; &s;o that they comfort them&s;elves in their lo&s;&s;es, by the facility of their Reparations.</P>
<P>For their Garments, which are very nece&s;|&s;ary for the re&s;i&s;tance of the Winter, Nature mu&s;t be acknowledged to have dealt very prudently in providing their Fore&s;ts, &s;o re|plete with Bea&s;ts of prey, with who&s;e Skins they protect them&s;elves again&s;t the injuries of the Weather. For, be&s;ides Furs of Otters,
<PB N="35" REF="24">
Martins, common Foxes, and Hares; they have &s;ome more precious, as your black Fox, Sa|bles, Beaver, Ermines, and gray Squirrels. They have white Bears al&s;o, who&s;e Skin is of great value, and much u&s;ed by great Per|&s;ons to hang behind the back of their Sledges, as an Ornament, when they travel or pa&s;s thorow the Town. The Skins of the common Bears are of much u&s;e to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, which bea&s;ts are there in &s;o great numbers, that they do not only infe&s;t the High-waies in Winter and make them dan|gerous, but trooping together in Companies, they &s;ometimes fall upon a whole Village, and de&s;troy it. Their Wolves are no le&s;s fierce, and &s;ometimes they have much ado to de|fend them&s;elves again&s;t them; They have white Wolves too, but not &s;o frequent. They have a water Rat, who&s;e skin is of a plea&s;ant Smell, and very proper to lay among&s;t cloaths.</P>
<P>They have Hemp and Flax in that abun|dance in <HI>Mo&s;covie,</HI> that notwith&s;tanding all that is exported from <HI>Archangel,</HI> linnen a|mong&s;t them is very cheap. It is not nece&s;|&s;ary that I mention the Leather of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> being a thing &s;o well known already in <HI>Europe</HI> by the means of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Hollander,</HI> who tran&s;port it dayly from <HI>Archangel.</HI> Cloth is the only thing that is defective to the <HI>Mu&s;covits,</HI> what they make there being cour&s;e and thick, and for the u&s;e only of the
<PB N="36" REF="25">
Pea&s;ants; which gives occa&s;ion to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> to drive a great Trade there every year with that Commodity.</P>
<P>As for Travailing, they have great advan|tages (e&s;pecially in the Winter) by their Sledges. For the Country being flat and ex|ceeding Cold, and the ground at that time covered con&s;tantly with Snow, their Sledges which are drawn with hor&s;es glide ea&s;ily away upon the &s;urface of it, and pa&s;s with incredible &s;wiftne&s;s. The&s;e Sledges are made of the Bark of the Linden-tree, about the length of a man, in which one lies along. They line them commonly with &s;ome thick Felt to make them warm, and becau&s;e the top is open, they cover and wrap them&s;elves up in good Furs, as well as they can. They travail under the conduct of a Carter, who &s;its on one &s;ide, and &s;ometimes by fits will endeavour to warm him&s;elf with running by, but mo&s;t commonly with good full draughts of &s;trong Water, which is his principal Pre|&s;ervative in his Travels. And if at any time he happens to overturn upon any Bank or Declivity, the Sledge being built low, the fall is the le&s;s dangerous. The Ladies Sledges, that are covered above and on all &s;ides like Coaches, are built much higher, and by con&s;equence much heavier, and are there|fore more dangerous, otherwi&s;e they &s;lide along upon the Snow like the re&s;t. This
<PB N="37" REF="25">
manner of Travailing in Sledges, is not only convenient (&s;eeing one may in three dayes time travail in them from <HI>Vologda</HI> to <HI>Mo&s;co,</HI> which is at lea&s;t an hundred leagues di&s;tance) but plea&s;ant al&s;o in &s;o plain a Country. And (pro|vided a man be well covered) he may &s;leep with ea&s;e, his motion is light and in&s;en&s;ible, and favours rather, than di&s;turbs ones repo&s;e: be&s;ides the Advantage of Travailing by nights, as well as by days, according to the importance of occa&s;ions. In Summer they have two waies of Travailing, by Land, and by water, whereas in Winter they Travail but only by Land. On the fir&s;t, one may tra|vail on Hor&s;e-back, by Coach, or by Waggon, the Ways being very broad, beautiful, and generally ea&s;ie for Travail all <HI>Mo&s;covie</HI> tho|row. In the other way of Travailing, they make u&s;e of certain little Boats, made all of one piece, of the trunk of a Tree made hol|low, in which they &s;tand right up, and row over Lakes and Rivers. So, the&s;e Boats being very light, a man with &s;mall care can travail a great way in a very &s;hort time. But there is this dangerous inconvenience in them, if there be not an exact counterpoi&s;e ob&s;erved, they totter from one &s;ide to another, till at la&s;t they turn quite over. They make u&s;e al&s;o of certain floting Bridges, made of pieces of Firr joined and tyed together, which bear them&s;elves up upon the Water. Further|more,
<PB N="38" REF="26">
they have this great incommodity in all &s;orts of Travailing, that they have no Inns or Hou&s;es of Reception to retire to, or where one may be accommodated, as in other Countries of <HI>Europe,</HI> &s;o that one mu&s;t carry both his Bed and Provi&s;ion along with him. And for this rea&s;on the Merchants that traffique from <HI>Archangel</HI> to <HI>Mo&s;co</HI> have their hou&s;es at <HI>Vologda</HI> and <HI>Mo&s;co,</HI> and being well known and accommodated, it is a great con|venience to travail with them. Another great incommodity in the Summer is the violence of the Heat, and the importunity of the Flies, buzzing perpetually about ones Face, and interrupting the plea&s;ure one might take in the beauty of the Fore&s;ts, and the grateful confu&s;ion of Light, and Shadow that is made in the Woods.</P>
<P>Thus far we have repre&s;ented the Condi|tion of the Country, we will now con&s;ider the Genius of the People &s;uccinctly; and that Fir&s;t, In re&s;pect of their Origine, their Stature, their Habits, and Language; Se|condly, Of their Humour, and Nature, and Di&s;po&s;ition; Thirdly, Of their Managery, and manner of Living; Fourthly, Of their Policy; and La&s;t of all, Of their Religion.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mo&s;covits,</HI> or <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians,</HI> are tho&s;e
<PB N="39" REF="26">
whom the Antients called <HI>Rhoxalani,</HI> they boa&s;t them&s;elves de&s;cended from the <HI>Greeks,</HI> whom in many things they zealou&s;ly imitate. But this I dare undertake, they are not de|&s;cended from the <HI>Lacedaemonians;</HI> If they be, they have left all their Vertue behind them. I &s;hould rather deduce them from tho&s;e, who were called <HI>Sibarites,</HI> who had the Reputation of good Drinkers above all others.</P>
<P>Their Shape and Proportion is much the &s;ame with the <HI>Germans,</HI> being for the mo&s;t part Corpulent, and of a &s;trong Complexion. The <HI>Boyars</HI> (for &s;o their principal Nobility are termed) are very ambitious to have their bellies &s;tick out, as if they e&s;teemed it a mark of their Nobility. Great Beards (as in <HI>Ger|many</HI>) are in great reque&s;t here al&s;o, and lookt upon as tokens of Virility, and he that hath the greater Beard, is the brave&s;t man among&s;t them. But though they wear their Beards &s;o long, yet they plea&s;e them&s;elves as much in the &s;hortne&s;s of their Hair, which they cut very clo&s;e, notwith&s;tanding the Coldne&s;s of the Country. Eccle&s;ia&s;tical per|&s;ons only wear long Hair, except &s;uch Lords of the Court as are in di&s;grace with the <HI>Czar,</HI> who as a te&s;timony of their affliction do &s;uffer it carele&s;ly to hang down over their Shoulders; Not unlike the antient Cu&s;tome among the <HI>Greeks,</HI> upon any publique or ex|traordinary
<PB N="40" REF="27">
Calamity. For then the Women &s;haved their Heads, and the Men wore their Hair at length; whereas commonly they did the contrary. The Women in <HI>Mo&s;covie</HI> are of a midling Stature, and well proportioned, they are for the mo&s;t part hand&s;om, and well featured; but painting is among&s;t them &s;o common, they never think them&s;elves beauti|ful without it. And whereas other Women u&s;e it as a concealment of their deformity, the&s;e for the mo&s;t part do u&s;e it (how gro&s;s or bad &s;oever it be) as a Veil to their beau|ty. The married Women have a Cu&s;tome of putting up their Haires in a Coyfe, whereas their Virgins &s;uffer it to hang down in two Tre&s;&s;es upon their Backs.</P>
<P>As to their Habits, the Men wear long great Robes down to their Feet, not much unlike the <HI>Greeks,</HI> with &s;leeves of the &s;ame length, but very &s;trait, in &s;o much as when they dre&s;s them&s;elves, they mu&s;t turn them up in &s;everal plates upon their Armes, and in that multitude of folds they fancy there is great comline&s;s. They have two conve|niences by the length of their &s;leeves; one, that in the Winter time they do the office of a Muff, whil&s;t having no imployment for their hands, they let them hang down at their full length. The other is, that when they have any de&s;ign to rob, or take revenge upon any body, they let them hang down as for
<PB N="41" REF="27">
warmth; and under that pretence they carry their cudgels, &s;tones, or daggers in them. They ordinarily wear them as low as their knucles, and &s;o they have but one half of their hands at liberty. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable Per&s;ons among&s;t them make their robes of Sattin, Damask, or cloth of Gold: The Ci|tizens, of cloth of a dusky, violet, or dark green colour, and &s;ometimes of red: The People of the lowe&s;t Condition have theirs of a dark-coloured cour&s;e Cloth, made in their own Country. In Winter every one lines them with Fur, according to their &s;e|veral qualities, the poor People generally lining theirs with Sheep skins, which though they be very u&s;eful again&s;t the Extremity of the weather, yet in this they are inconveni|ent, that they ca&s;t an ill &s;mell, and are in perpetual ho&s;tility with our No&s;es. They wear Ju&s;te-au-corps or Ve&s;ts al&s;o, which are made clo&s;e to their Body, and come down to the Calf of their Legs, open before, and &s;et to the bottom with Gold or Silver buttons, and having Collars very large. Under them, they have &s;trait Breeches, and Wa&s;t-coats (which they call <HI>Caftan</HI>) that come down to their knees, who&s;e Collars are made after the fa&s;hion of the <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> only the&s;e are much higher, &s;o that they go round about the hin|der part of their Heads. They are generally made of Sattin, Damask, or Taffaty, and be|cau&s;e
<PB N="42" REF="28">
the&s;e Collars, by rea&s;on of their heighth, are very con&s;picuous, they line them many times with Velvet, or cloth of Gold, and &s;ometimes adorn them with Pearls and pre|cious Stones. Nor doth this vanity re&s;t here, it goes even to their Shirts, which the riche&s;t &s;ort Embroider at the Collar, Wri&s;ts, and Brea&s;t, with &s;everal coloured Silk, and &s;ome|times with Jewels or Gold. They wear no Hats, only a Bonnet of cloth, with a little &s;nip open before and behind, which hath &s;ome|thing of the form of a Pyramide. The Nobi|lity have them of Scarlet cloth, or Velvet embroidered with Pearl on the &s;ides, and in Winter time lined with the preciou&s;e&s;t Furs; but the common Sort wear nothing but white Felt or cloth Caps, which they get lined in Winter with the vile&s;t &s;ort of Fur. Cloath is &s;o dear in that Country, that many among&s;t them make no bones of patching up their Bonnets with pieces and &s;hreds of &s;undry colours, &s;o that they re&s;emble in &s;ome man|ner the di&s;gui&s;ed Water-men in the Play. The&s;e Bonnets I ob&s;erved to be altogether in|convenient abroad; for having no brims, they give no protection again&s;t the Sun, the Wind, the Rain, or the Snow: whereas our Hats are &s;ome defence to us in all the&s;e ca&s;es. The <HI>Polonian</HI> Bonnets are more commodious than the&s;e; for they are made with a brim of pa&s;t|board, of each &s;ide covered over with Fur:
<PB N="43" REF="28">
and hence it is, that in Winter mo&s;t Strangers make u&s;e of them in <HI>Mo&s;covie,</HI> as being war|mer than our hats. In &s;tead of Shoes, the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> wear commonly Boots without &s;tops, which &s;erve them al&s;o for Pockets: the Pea|&s;ants wear &s;hoes made of the bark of a Tree wrought very thin, and interwoven and braided, after the manner of Wicker baskets. The mo&s;t of them have no Stockins, only &s;ome peeces of Fur or cloth wrapt about their Legs, and tied fa&s;t with a pack-thred. There is no great difference betwixt the Mens Ha|bits and the Womens, &s;aving that the Wo|mens Robes are &s;omewhat larger, and their Sleeves not &s;o fa&s;tned to the bodies of their Robes, but that they can either put them on, or let them hang by as they plea&s;e. They have this onely peculiar in their &s;mock|&s;leeves, that they are commonly three or four Ells long, plated into &s;o many folds, that they have nothing el&s;e from the top of their Arm to their Fingers end. But their greate&s;t dif|ference is in their Bonnets, which for the Women, are made a very fanta&s;tical way.</P>
<P>Their Language hath great affinity with the <HI>Slavonian,</HI> as well as the <HI>Polonian,</HI> &s;o that he who under&s;tands either of the&s;e, can|not be at any great lo&s;s for the <HI>Mo&s;covian,</HI> which is plea&s;ant enough, and not very dif|ficult to learn. They have borrowed their Characters from the <HI>Greeks,</HI> but have &s;ince
<PB N="44" REF="29">
much altered and transformed them, and they abound &s;o much in double Letters, that they have increa&s;ed their Alphabet to the number of forty. But their Character is that alone wherein they communicate with the <HI>Greek;</HI> for their Words have very little affinity to it.</P>
<P>And thus I have given an account of their Original, their Stature, their Habits, and their Language; we will now proceed to their Nature and Genius.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mo&s;covites</HI> (as appears particularly by their Commerce) are a People of great Wit, Cunning, and Dexterity.</P>
<P>They are of a Temper very remarkable in this, that they are &s;o accu&s;tomed to the Ex|tremities of Heat and Cold, that the &s;uddene&s;t and mo&s;t violent alteration that can be, makes no ill impre&s;&s;ion on their health. There one may &s;ee little Children come running out of their warm Stoves in their &s;hirts in the mid&s;t of Winter, and having (in the fierce&s;t Cold imaginable) taken two or three frisks upon the Snow, return immediately into their Stoves, and find no inconvenience by the change. In&s;omuch, that as <HI>Age&s;ilaus</HI> had but one Habit Winter and Summer; &s;o do the&s;e &s;eem to have but one Temper; neither the Heat &s;ucceeding the Cold, nor the Cold the
<PB N="45" REF="29">
Heat, making any alteration in them. In &s;hort, they are &s;o hardned and accu&s;tomed to both Heat and Cold, that their Cu&s;tome &s;eems to be turned into Nature. Be&s;ides, they be|ing u&s;ed to very hard fare, and brought up as they are in &s;ervitude and &s;lavery, they mu&s;t unque&s;tionably be very proper for the Wars. And indeed having little comfort or plea&s;ure in their lives, they want rather Conduct than Courage to fight. Neverthele&s;s, Idlene&s;s which in other places is reckoned as the Root of all Vices, &s;eems to be peculiar to this Na|tion, &s;o Lazy are they naturally, and of &s;uch Antipathy to all kind of Labour. It mu&s;t be either force or nece&s;&s;ity that compels them thereunto, they often preferring a ba&s;tinado or whipping before an hone&s;t but painful imployment.</P>
<P>From hence it is, that Drunkenne&s;s among&s;t them is &s;o familiar, that there are but few Per&s;ons exempt from it. The Clergy are ad|dicted to it, as well as the Laity, the Women as the Men, the Young as the Old, all &s;triving as it were, with a bruti&s;h emulation to out|drink one another. <HI>Aquavitae</HI> is generally the charm by which this Metamorpho&s;is is made, like the liquour of <HI>Circe,</HI> which turns them into Swine; or like the Mead of <HI>Camma</HI> which carries death along with it, when they venture &s;o far as to dye upon the &s;pot. Yet I mu&s;t &s;ay, that notwith&s;tanding this liquor
<PB N="46" REF="30">
is very nece&s;&s;ary in this Country, and that there were &s;carce any living without it, in regard it is a &s;overeign Remedy again&s;t the Cold, and not un-u&s;eful in Summer. But the abu&s;e of it is grown &s;o great, that, in&s;tead of taking it now and then for the re-inforce|ment of their Spirits, they imploy it to their di&s;&s;olution; and whereas by a moderate ta|king, it would be a means of refre&s;hment, their debauches pervert its good effects, and turn it to their ruin. Tobacco was formerly al&s;o taken with no le&s;s extravagancy than their &s;trong Water now, but in the year 1634 the <HI>Czar</HI> and Patriarch thought good with great rigour to prohibit it, many of them having before that time &s;et their Hou&s;es on fire by their negligence, when they were drunk with Tobacco. The poore People in|&s;tead of buying them&s;elves bread, con&s;umed all their Money in Tobacco. Be&s;ides (which was the particular di&s;gu&s;t of the Patriarch) they pre&s;ented them&s;elves before their Ima|ges with &s;o reeking and &s;moaky a breath, that, perhaps he was afraid, they would poi|&s;on their Saints, with the &s;tink of their To|bacco. At this day it is more frequently u&s;ed than in &s;ome years pa&s;t, the &s;earch being not now &s;o &s;trict again&s;t the takers, nor the pu|ni&s;hment &s;o &s;everely inflicted on them that &s;ell it. Strangers have the liberty to u&s;e it, which makes the <HI>Mo&s;covites</HI> to be the more
<PB N="47" REF="30">
de&s;irous of it, for &s;ome of them would almo&s;t wor&s;hip a man for a pipe of Tobacco.</P>
<P>But Vice having (as <HI>Plutarch</HI> ob&s;erves) many baits and allurements, by the motion and repre&s;entation of which, it gives the Pa&s;&s;ions &s;everal encroachments to entangle them&s;elves: So may I &s;ay of Drunkenne&s;s, that it hath its attraction, and draws men into La&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s and Exce&s;s. Among&s;t the re&s;t of the World, the <HI>Mo&s;covites</HI> do furni&s;h us with experiments of this kind, both the Wo|men and the Men giving them&s;elves over to Ebriety, there is a concomitant addiction to Wantonne&s;s. True it is, the <HI>Czar</HI> permits not any publick Brothels, but the Drunkenne&s;s and Idlene&s;s wherewith this Country is exce&s;|&s;ively delighted, is the occa&s;ion of &s;o great irregularity, that Sodomie it &s;elf is no &s;tran|ger to it.</P>
<Q><L>Quaeritur Aegy&s;thus quare &s;it factus adulter,</L>
<L>In promptu cau&s;a e&s;t de&s;idio&s;us erat.</L> <BIBL>Ovid.</BIBL></Q>
<P>Upon this &s;core the In&s;olencies they com|mit in their ordinary Quarrels are in&s;uppor|table. Upon all occa&s;ions they make no &s;cruple of upbraiding one another with In|ce&s;t, Sodomie, and &s;uch crimes, as the very thought of them ought to be horrid and abo|minable.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, Civility and Complacence among&s;t them is &s;o rare, tis no wonder if they be very
<PB N="48" REF="31">
&s;paring of it before Strangers: to whom if they bear any difference or re&s;pect, it is cer|tainly from &s;ome advantage they expect to draw from them. And in that ca&s;e they &s;pare not their Caps, and the greate&s;t reverence they can &s;how, which is commonly expre&s;&s;ed by a low declination of their Head towards the ground without moving a Foot. The Women u&s;e al&s;o the &s;ame way of &s;aluting one another, only they bow them&s;elves more gradually, and letting their hands hang loo&s;e by their &s;ides, they touch not their Bonnets at all. But when a Citizen or Pea&s;ant would &s;how &s;omething more than ordinary Re&s;pect, then he goes to the very ground, and pro|&s;trates him&s;elf, even to the beating the ground with his Forehead; which is the manner of expre&s;&s;ing the Reverence which they bear to their Nobility. And this extreme &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion is that which makes their Magi&s;trates &s;o in|&s;olent, and &s;o exceeding jealous of their Authoritie, that Strangers let them be of what Quality they will, do very rarely meet with any Kindne&s;s or Civility among&s;t them. And withall, having an opinion of the Gran|deur of their Emperour, that he is incom|parably greater than any King in <HI>Europe,</HI> from thence it comes to pa&s;s, that they u&s;e Amba&s;&s;adors &s;o indifferently, making no &s;cruple to prefer them&s;elves before them; in which regard there is great prudence and
<PB N="49" REF="31">
circum&s;pection required to the maintaining the Honour of ones Prince among&s;t them.</P>
<P>And this is in general a true Character of the Humour of the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians;</HI> it remains now that (according to the Order I have pro|po&s;ed) I give &s;ome Pro&s;pect of their manner of Living.</P>
<P><HI>Mo&s;covie</HI> is indeed a very fertile and plen|tiful Country, yet the Inhabitants brought up from their Cradles in great Hard&s;hip and Au&s;terity, under&s;tand not how to improve the advantages it yields. And being born as it were to Slaverie, they ea&s;ily endure tho&s;e Incommodities, which without long accu&s;to|mation would have been intolerable. So that what <HI>Age&s;ilaus</HI> &s;aid of the People of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> may be very well applyed to them, <HI>viz.</HI> That they are very good Slaves, but would make the wor&s;t Free-men in the World. For their Oeconomie and the affairs of their Hou&s;es, it is certain, they are very ill furni&s;ht, that they live very poorely, and that they know no &s;uperfluity, but of Drink. Tho&s;e Per&s;ons of Quality that are obliged to live in any Equipage or Heighth, have all their Provi&s;ions from their own Farms. The common People have little other chear than Peas, Tur|nops, Cabbages, Coleworts, and fre&s;h Cucum|bers,
<PB N="50" REF="32">
or pickled with Salt and Vinegar. They have fre&s;h Fi&s;h and Salt &s;ometimes: but then they never forget their Onyons and Garlick, which are their principal hautgout. Be&s;ides the&s;e they have little other fare, e&s;pecially of Fle&s;h, mo&s;t of their year being taken up by fa&s;ting days, and their Butter and Chee&s;e is &s;o bad, that it is a hard thing for Strangers to make u&s;e of them. Tho&s;e who are rich enough to have <HI>Aquavitae</HI> of their own, will not &s;it down at the Table, till they have drank of it, and whil&s;t they are at Meales they drink it, and le&s;t their Dige&s;tion &s;hould be weak, they mu&s;t needs have their Dram too afterwards. The common People are alwaies prepared for it, as well drunk as &s;ober, at midnight as at noon-day; and though their Waters are made very &s;trong, yet for fear they &s;hould not be hot enough, they clap in now and then a good quantity of Pepper. Their Ordinary drink is <HI>Mead</HI> and <HI>Quaz,</HI> as I have intimated before. After Dinner the <HI>Ru&s;&s;es</HI> have a Cu&s;tome of &s;hutting up their Shops, and going to &s;leep; and the great Per&s;ons among&s;t them, will &s;carce &s;peak of affaires with any Body. Neverthele&s;s they u&s;e Beds &s;o little, that none but &s;ome Per&s;ons of quality do lye upon Beds or Quilts. The People of <HI>Capua</HI> had antiently a Cu&s;tome to &s;uffer none of their Children to u&s;e any Beds, till they were married, becau&s;e as they al|ledged,
<PB N="51" REF="32">
Beds were not invented for young beardle&s;s Boys, but for antient and decrepit Men. Among&s;t the <HI>Mo&s;covites</HI> this Cu&s;tome is more &s;evere; for they u&s;e them neither be|fore, nor after they are married, nor in the very extremity of Age. In Winter time they content them&s;elves to lye along upon a table or a bench of Firr before their Stoves, cove|ring them&s;elves only with their clothes: and for coolne&s;s in Summer they make bold with the Ground.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of Candles, the Pea&s;ants make u&s;e of long and thin chips of Firr, which being very dry pre&s;ently take fire, and give a great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ight. But becau&s;e they are in&s;tantly burnt but, they mu&s;t have a good &s;tore of them to &s;upply, if they want light but for a little time.</P>
<P>One thing there is very commendable a|mong&s;t the <HI>Mo&s;covites,</HI> and that is, that the Women have great re&s;pect generally for their Husbands; for which rea&s;on they are ex|ceedingly retired, and appear very &s;eldome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n publique. And this is a Cu&s;tome &s;o confor|mable to Nature, and &s;o religiou&s;ly ob&s;erved among&s;t the Antients, that there is no per&s;on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">naddicted to a carnal &s;en&s;e, but will con|demn the liberty which is at this time taken <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y mo&s;t of the Women in <HI>Europe.

that is, that &s;he &s;hould appear when her Hu&s;|band is by, and in his ab&s;ence keep her &s;elf clo&s;e at home. <HI>Phidias</HI> making the Image of <HI>Venus</HI> for the <HI>Elians,</HI> repre&s;ented her &s;tanding upon a Tortoi&s;e; to &s;ignifie, that a Woman &s;hould by no means be go&s;&s;ipping abroad. It is to be commended al&s;o in the <HI>Mo&s;covites,</HI> that they permit not their Wives to be &s;een too frequently in the Streets, though in other things their Di&s;cipline appears rigid enough, and favouring of too much &s;everity. For they make u&s;e of them only as a nece&s;&s;arie evil, they look upon them &s;upercilliou&s;ly, and with frownes, they beat them often, and handle them as if they were their &s;laves, and not part of them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But if the Women in general are &s;o retired, a|mong&s;t the Nobility, the Virgins are much more for be&s;ides, that they appear very &s;eldom a|broad, when they do &s;o they cover them&s;elves alwaies with a Vaile, to prevent their being &s;een: &s;o that many times they marry before the Bride-groom hath &s;een his Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es face Among&s;t them it is not permitted that young Men and Maids &s;ee one another, nor that they make any promi&s;es of Marriage by Word o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Writing, tho&s;e things being alwaies left to the tran&s;action of the Parents. So it &s;ometime happens that the Bridegroom, having not &s;ee his Wife till he be brought up into her cham+ber where &s;he is laid, that the man who ex+pected
<PB N="53" REF="33">
a very hand&s;om Wife, meets with a deformed Per&s;on, and perhaps a counterfeit, if the Parents will but con&s;ent to the Cheat. This Cu&s;tome of Womens wearing Vailes, is very antient, e&s;pecially among&s;t the <HI>Jews,</HI> who did it in token of Ba&s;hfulne&s;s and Cha&s;tity, as the <HI>Mo&s;covites</HI> do now. And hence it was that <HI>Rebecca</HI> as &s;oon as &s;he &s;aw her Husband, took a Vail and covered her&s;elf, and that <HI>La|ban</HI> deceived <HI>Jacob,</HI> when he gave him <HI>Leah</HI> his Elde&s;t daughter, who was bleer-eyed, in&s;tead of the Beautiful <HI>Rachel</HI> whom he had promi&s;ed him.</P>
<P>The Demeanour of the <HI>Mo&s;covites</HI> being thus de&s;cribed, as to their manner of Living, we &s;hall now &s;peak &s;omewhat of the Baths, of which they make u&s;e in imitation of the An|tients. They are clo&s;e places with Furnaces, which they heat exceedingly, and for the greater excitation of Vapours, they ca&s;t Cold water now and then upon the Stove. They have divers Benches, at &s;ome di&s;tance, one above another, which yield &s;everal degrees of Heat, according as each one thinks con|venient. They lay them&s;elves along &s;tark naked upon the&s;e Benches, and after they have &s;wet a competent time by means of tho&s;e hot Vapours, that have diffu&s;ed them|&s;elves all over the Bath, there is care taken, that their Bodies be well wa&s;hed with Warm water, or &s;ome other liquour, and rubbed all
<PB N="54" REF="34">
over with hand-fuls of Hearbs. After which they commonly take a Dram of the bottle, to re-inforce their Spirits, which are &s;ome|times &s;o weakened by their &s;weating, that they fall into a &s;wound. And the&s;e Baths are the univer&s;al Remedies the <HI>Mo&s;covites</HI> make u&s;e of, as well for keeping of their Bodies clean, as for con&s;ervation of their Health, which they enjoy with great advantage above other Nations. And for this rea&s;on there is not a Town without its Stoves, both publique and private: which they believe very nece&s;&s;ary for new married People, e&s;pecially after their fir&s;t congre&s;s, therefore in &s;uch a ca&s;e, they alwaies make u&s;e of this kind of purification.</P>
<P>And fora&s;much as every Country hath its diverti&s;ements, as being nece&s;&s;ary for the Exerci&s;e and Recreation of the Body, it is but rea&s;onable to &s;ay &s;omething of tho&s;e that are in u&s;e among&s;t the <HI>Mo&s;covites.</HI></P>
<P>At their Fe&s;tivals, their young Men are ac|cu&s;tomed to meet in great numbers, and for their pa&s;time to play at fifty cuffs, or cudgels, without the lea&s;t quarrelling, or exceptions. By which means they are &s;o inured to blows, that they become almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible, and have much greater aver&s;ion to work, than they have to the whip or the cudgel, though the &s;ame be laid on in very good earne&s;t. Some al&s;o there are that under&s;tand wre&s;tling pretty well, with which they exerci&s;e them|&s;elves
<PB N="55" REF="34">
in imitation of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who are taken to be very skilful in this kind of Recre|ation. In Winter they have a &s;ort of Pattins, or Scates, as they have in <HI>Holland,</HI> of which they make u&s;e, as &s;oon as the Rivers are fro|zen, not to make their journeys with (as in the <HI>Low-Countries</HI>) but for their Exerci&s;e, and to warm them&s;elves upon the Ice. They are made of Wood, with a long peece of poli&s;hed Iron at the bottome, very &s;trait and turned upward at the toe, and that the Iron may the better cut the Ice, they turn their Feet, on the one &s;ide and the other, &s;o that they go directly on very fa&s;t. They have al&s;o publique Engins to Swing withal, like a dou|ble gallowes, having four places for four men, all in an equal di&s;tance, where having placed them&s;elves, they &s;wing continually by the Counterpoi&s;e they give one another, &s;o that while &s;ome &s;wing up to the heighth of a Wind-mill, one may &s;ee the others falling near as low as the Ground: which they do &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, till they think it fit to hold. The Women have Ropes which they &s;wing with, or el&s;e they lay a plank cro&s;s a block, and mounting one at one end, and the other at the other, they to&s;s them&s;elves up with a very violent motion. Their ordinary Mu&s;ique, is nothing but a bag pipe, which they accom|pany &s;ometimes with the tune of a Song. They make &s;o ill u&s;e of their Trumpets and
<PB N="56" REF="35">
Kettle-Drums, that the &s;ame render but a har&s;h and ob&s;treperous Harmony; Their Howboys are much better, which they u&s;e before their Infantry in the Wars.</P>
<P>As for their dancing, it is &s;o ab&s;urd and ridiculous, that the Bears they teach to dance there acquit them&s;elves better than them|&s;elves. For they tumble up and down in &s;uch Bruti&s;h and unbecoming po&s;tures, one would think they u&s;e it onely to excite La&s;civiou&s;|ne&s;s, whereas this exerci&s;e &s;hould be under|taken, and managed with decency as a thing that is very graceful and honourable. They u&s;e great di&s;tortions with their hands, &s;houlders, and back parts, and hopping right up with their feet, they &s;carce appear to move one &s;tep out of their place.</P>
<P>This being their manner of Living in pri|vate, we &s;hall now give an accompt how they regulate them&s;elves in re&s;pect of the publick, by the Laws and Cu&s;tomes of their Country; and &s;o having done with their Oeconomy, we &s;hall proceed to their Policie, and after that to their Religion.</P>
<P>Policie and Religion are the two Poles, on which the Globe of civil Societie moves. And though it is po&s;&s;ible &s;ome places may be found very barbarous and licentious, where
<PB N="57" REF="35">
Learning and Civility were in no e&s;teem, and where the Government by Kings was not u&s;ual, yet it is hard to name any place that hath &s;ub&s;i&s;ted without &s;ome Policie or other, and where they have not had &s;ome &s;en&s;e or apprehen&s;ion of a Deitie. But among&s;t all the Policies of the World, Monarchie is mani|fe&s;tly the mo&s;t advantageous, as mo&s;t con|formable to the Maje&s;tie of God, who alone manages and pre&s;ides over the whole Uni|ver&s;e. The State of <HI>Mo&s;covie</HI> which is now before us, is Monarchical: but it is al&s;o De|&s;potical and Ab&s;olute, in&s;omuch as the <HI>Tzar</HI> being Lord and Ma&s;ter (as it were) over all his Subjects, di&s;po&s;eth uncontroulably of their lives and e&s;tates, as he thinks good. And under this kind of Monarchie it was they lived, which were antiently called <HI>Barbarians,</HI> as the <HI>A&s;&s;yrians, Medes,</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> who&s;e Princes u&s;urped that Magi&s;terial Authoritie over their Per&s;ons and Goods, governing their Subjects no otherwi&s;e than as a Lord doth his &s;laves. And &s;uch at this day is the Go|vernment in <HI>Turky,</HI> where the Grand Segniour hath &s;o ab&s;olute a Sovereignitie over his Sub|jects, that he di&s;po&s;eth of their lives and for|tunes, as an ab&s;olute Lord. But for the better comprehen&s;ion of the State of <HI>Mo&s;covie</HI> under the Domination of &s;o unque&s;tionable a Prince, it is Fir&s;t to be con&s;idered, in what his great|ne&s;s and Authoritie con&s;i&s;ts; Secondly the

Submi&s;&s;ion, Obedience, and &s;ingular Re&s;pect his Subjects bear him; Thirdly the Policie and Order, by which his Dominion over his Subjects is maintained, and the union and concurrence of Obedience in his Subjects pre&s;erved and e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>

<PB N="59" REF="36">
mu&s;t be acknowledged to be great, &s;o his Revenues mu&s;t be owned to be extraordi|nary and commen&s;urate. For be&s;ides his proper Demains, which are very con&s;iderable, he hath an incredible Revenue from the Taverns, which he licen&s;eth thorow all his Dominions; be&s;ides, five <HI>per</HI> Cent he exacts for all Merchandi&s;e imported or exported, and a va&s;t Sum of Money he receives from the Factors he imployes him&s;elf. He hath a great Revenue al&s;o out of his Furs, and Cavyar, being a commodity he re&s;erves en|tirely to him&s;elf, he makes very great advan|tages by that al&s;o. Yet this I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, that if his Trea&s;ure be va&s;t, his I&s;&s;ues and Expences are not &s;mall, as well in re&s;pect of the Splendour and extraordinary Pompe he lives in, as the continual Wars he maintains with his Neighbors, either the <HI>Swedes,</HI> or the <HI>Polanders,</HI> or el&s;e the <HI>Tartars.</HI> For which rea&s;on he frequently rai&s;es: mighty Armies, and for his better Succe&s;s, gives great Pen|&s;ions to his Officers, which are paid very punctually; and by this means he draws many Stangers to him, who&s;e &s;ervice he likes very well, and knows which way to gratifie their Prudence and Fidelity. True it is, generally upon the commencement of a War, it is the People that &s;upply him according to his de|mands, by which he gives them &s;everely &s;ome|times to under&s;tand the Power he hath over their fortunes and e&s;tates.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="37">The greatne&s;s of this Prince being e&s;tabli&s;ht in this manner, through the va&s;t extent of his Dominion, by the abundance of his Wealth, the magnificence of his Court, and the ab&s;o|lutene&s;&s;e and indi&s;putablene&s;&s;e of his power over all his Subjects; it is not to be doubted but the &s;ame imprints a mo&s;t profound re&s;pect in the hearts of the people towards his Per&s;on. And indeed &s;o abject are they, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to the Soveraigns command, that they will them&s;elves declare their own &s;ervitude, and caknowledg they hold their E&s;tates from God and him only. Some would not refu&s;e any danger for his &s;ake, and would perhaps many times be over joy'd to expo&s;e their innocent lives at the Capriccio or fury of a Tyrant. They will freely confe&s;s to be his Slaves, and as a Te&s;timony of their Humility, they will ne|ver name them&s;elves in his pre&s;ence but with a diminutive, as if a Petitioners name be <HI>Pe|ter,</HI> he will &s;ay: <HI>I little Peter the humble&s;t of all your Va&s;&s;als do implore,</HI> &amp;c. They boa&s;t of nothing more than the &s;parkling eyes of their Prince, (be he never &s;o &s;hore-&s;ighted as <HI>Dyo|ni&s;ius</HI> of <HI>Syracu&s;e</HI> was,) for they cry always, I have had the honor or &s;hall have the honor to &s;ee the cleare eyes of our <HI>Tzar.</HI> And did not Chri&s;tian mode&s;ty re&s;train them a little in the Religious re&s;pect they bear unto their Monarch, they would be near to fly out into &s;uch Extravagant acclamations, as were u&s;ed
<PB N="61" REF="37">
to King <HI>Herod;</HI> and &s;ay of his voice, that it is the voice of a God, and not of a man. They are very careful al&s;o of in&s;inuating this Reve|rence into their Children, and of making them know the Maje&s;ty of their Prince, before they are capable of under&s;tanding the mi&s;ery of their condition.</P>
<P>And this di&s;cipline is principally founded upon three general Maximes; one of which is, That it is prohibited upon pain of death to any man to Travail out of that Country, unle&s;s they be the <HI>Tzars</HI> Merchants, or Mini&s;ters of State, which he &s;ends to other Princes in qua|lity of Amba&s;&s;adors. The rea&s;on is, le&s;t by their Travails into other parts, they &s;hould bring back &s;ome new cu&s;tomes at their return, and having ta&s;ted the &s;weetne&s;s of the liberty other Nations injoy, they &s;hould &s;ome time or other break a&s;under the chains of their own Servitude. This maxime to us that are in|amoured with the happy liberty we are born under, might perhaps &s;eem barbarous and in|tollerable, but the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> are &s;o accu&s;tomed to this kind of Slavery, that they are &s;carce &s;en&s;ible of it, and do comfort them&s;elves in the va&s;tne&s;s of their Country, which affords them &s;pace enough for their Travails, and in the Examples of other Countries, which have lived, and do live under the &s;ame maxime. The <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> among&s;t others, who glo|ried and boa&s;ted that they lived under the
<PB N="62" REF="38">
greate&s;t liberty, were &s;ubject notwith&s;tanding to this Law, &amp; forbidden any Commerce with forreign Nations: Whereas the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> are permitted to Traffick with them in their own Country. Which gives me &s;ome hopes they will in time leave off that ru&s;tick and barbarous humor, which is &s;o natural to them, and learn by degrees to live with more civili|ty, for they are already delighted with the Conver&s;ation of forreign Merchants, and do plea&s;e them&s;elves very much in their manner of living. And were they under a gentler Government, and had a free Trade with eve|ry body, no doubt but this Nation would in a &s;hort time be taken with our civility and decent way of living. But this maxime that we do now di&s;cour&s;e of, has no le&s;s effect to|wards the maintenance of their Religion, than their civil Cu&s;tomes, and is &s;o exactly ob&s;er|ved, that the very Strangers them&s;elves that have entred into the &s;ervice of the <HI>Tzar,</HI> or have otherwi&s;e embraced their Religion, are not exempt from it. For to have made him|&s;elf a &s;ervant to the Great Duke, is to have made him&s;elf his Slave, and to have taken up his Religion, is to have abandoned his own Country, and to be always confined within the Limits of <HI>Mu&s;covie.</HI> In &s;hort, by this Policy it may be ea&s;ily imagined the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> un|der&s;tand little of Navigation, &s;eeing they ex|erci&s;e it &s;o little: and indeed they know no
<PB N="63" REF="38">
other Compa&s;s than the Earth, nor do any of them, except &s;ome few fi&s;her-men, expo&s;e them&s;elves to the Sea, and they no farther than within &s;ight of the Shore.</P>
<P>The Second Maxime the <HI>Tzars</HI> make u&s;e of, for maintaining the Policie of their E|&s;tate is, That they marry no forreign Prin|ce&s;&s;es, nor look out any farher for a Wife, than their own proper Slaves. The other Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI> who are &s;olicitous of no|thing but the good and happine&s;s of their Subjects, do comport them&s;elves cleer other|wi&s;e; they marry them&s;elves with forreign Ladies for the Alliance of their Nations, and in order to e&s;tabli&s;h a reciprocal and perpe|tual Amitie betwixt them, for the benefit of both. By which means they avoid the in&s;o|lence of their Wives Relations, which is almo&s;t inevitable, where a Prince takes a Wife out of his own Subjects. Moreover, it is certainly more honourable and more wor|thy the Maje&s;tie of a King, to e&s;pou&s;e a Prin|ce&s;s that is not of the number of his Subjects, uniting and mingling, as it were, their Crowns as well as their blood to produce a Po&s;terity perfectly Royal. Whereas to take a Wife from that infinite di&s;tance, which there is be|twixt a King and a Subject, to join her to the Crown, to de&s;cend from his Throne, as it were, to rai&s;e her up thither, who perhaps is very unfit for &s;o great an elevation, is no le&s;s
<PB N="64" REF="39">
than to pro&s;titute and deba&s;e the Maje&s;tie of a Monarch. Yet among&s;t the <HI>Tzars</HI> of <HI>Mo&s;covy</HI> it is very u&s;ual, le&s;t by introducing a foreign Prince&s;s &s;he &s;hould bring &s;ome new Cu&s;tomes along with her, which in time might cau&s;e &s;ome alteration in the State. And from hence it was, that this pre&s;ent <HI>Tzar</HI> vouch&s;afed on Shrove-Sunday 1647. (which was then the &s;eventeenth year of his Age and the &s;econd of his Reign) to marry the elde&s;t Daughter of <HI>Ilia-Danilovitz Milo&s;lausky,</HI> a per&s;on at that time in no excellent Condition; for to &s;peak properly, there was nothing but the Beauty of his Daughter to induce the <HI>Tzar</HI> to ho|nour him with &s;o great a Relation.</P>
<P>The Third Maxime by which their Policie and Religion is pre&s;erved, is their Ignorance of Learning, which is &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed in this Country, that they never learn farther than to write and read their own Language. And indeed Experience doth teach us this truth, that Seditions and Revolutions have not been any where &s;o frequent as in Com|monwealths, where Learning was commonly in great e&s;teem, and even when it triumphed mo&s;t. The rea&s;on of which is plain, fora&s;|much as Ambition and Pride march alwaies in the Rear of great Knowledge: whereas Ignorance (as is evident among&s;t the Pea|&s;ants and common People every where) renders them more &s;upple and obedient: And
<PB N="65" REF="39">
this <HI>Valentian</HI> and <HI>Licinius</HI> Emperors of <HI>Rome</HI> had experience of, when they termed Learn|ing the Plague and Poi&s;on of a Kingdom. <HI>Lycurgus</HI> was not far from this opinion, when he e&s;tabli&s;ht Ignorance in his Republique. And we &s;ee at this day the greate&s;t Enemy of Chri|&s;tendom triumphing, partly by vertue of this Maxime, over all the Monarchs of this Age. The <HI>Tzars</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;covie</HI> al&s;o find great benefit by this Policy, which conduces much to the ea&s;ie Con&s;ervation of Obedience in their Sub|jects towards their Soveraign Empire. So that the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> have this advantage, that they quietly enjoy their apprehen&s;ions of Nature, as they are at fir&s;t &s;ight repre&s;ented to their &s;en&s;e, or their rea&s;ons, without any &s;candalous Imputation of Ignorance. They do not trouble them&s;elves with the heighth of the Heavens, nor the greatne&s;s of the Earth, whether the Sun (as <HI>Anaximenes</HI> thought) be as flat as a Trencher, or whether it be hunch backed un|derneath like a Cockboat, as <HI>Heraclitus</HI> held, or whether it be round or &s;quare. They di|&s;turb not their heads with the dimen&s;ions of the Moon, to know whether &s;he be hung loo&s;e in the Air, or inhabited or not, whether the Stars be but Earth Muminated as <HI>Thales</HI> main|tained or whether perfect fire as <HI>Plato.</HI> They leave Nature to it &s;elf, and think it &s;ufficient to know who is its Author, to di&s;cover the u&s;e of things by experience, and to give God
<PB N="66" REF="40">
thanks as they are able. They amu&s;e not them&s;elves to make Syllogi&s;mes, after the Mo|del of <HI>Barbara</HI> or of <HI>Fe&s;tino,</HI> to di&s;pute whe|ther <HI>Logick</HI> be an <HI>Art</HI> or <HI>Science,</HI> nor to de|termine &s;undry other curious and impertinent que&s;tions, which though of no u&s;e but to mo|le&s;t and torture the brain, are yet at this day among&s;t the learned people, in great practice and u&s;e, upon a meer principle of Curio&s;ity, Ambition, or Intere&s;t. In &s;tead of Books the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> u&s;e Rolls of Paper as the Jews did &s;ometimes; they glue every leaf to|gether by the ends, with a certain Glue they have out of <HI>Siberia</HI> a Province of the <HI>Tzars,</HI> which they moi&s;ten only with the end of their tongue, and drawing it upon the Edges of the two leaves they are to joyn, they put the Edges upon one another, which fa&s;ten &s;o clo&s;e, it is &s;carce perceivable where they are joyned, and in this manner they make Rolls &s;ometimes of &s;even or eight Fathoms long.</P>

Their Councel is commonly held in the Night, and the <HI>Tzar</HI> changes the Governours of his Provinces every three Years.</P>
<P>There is no room for &s;ubtilties or wrang|ling in this Country, they di&s;patch their Suits in a &s;hort time, according to the plainne&s;s and paucity of their Laws. So that the Atturneys and Sollicitors are there of as little u&s;e and concernment as the Philo&s;ophers.</P>
<P>Among&s;t other puni&s;hments that they u&s;e, they have one they call <HI>Battoki,</HI> which has much affinity with that which God ordained in the time of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> for the people of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> as appears in the 25. Chapter of <HI>Deuteronomy.</HI> They &s;trip the condemned per&s;on to his Shirt, <HI>e. g.</HI> for having been the Author of &s;ome Riot, pilfering, or &s;ome other &s;uch &s;mall crime as is not worthy of death; Who then laying him|&s;elf flat upon his Belly on the ground, there are two Men placed on each &s;ide of him, which give him as many blows with a Cudgel one af|ter another, as the Judge that pre&s;ides does condemn him to, &s;ixteen, twenty or thirty, more or le&s;s, according to the quality and propor|tion
<PB N="68" REF="41">
of the offence he has committed. And as &s;oon as his accompt is made up, he ri&s;es and makes his reverence to the per&s;on that con|demned him; Not much unlike the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> who after correction returned, and gave their King thanks for his great Bounty in remem|bring them. The <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> u&s;e this kind of Cha&s;ti&s;ement in their private Families al&s;o, e&s;pecially the Nobility, who have commonly great &s;tore of Slaves, who without re&s;pect of their Society are oftentimes con&s;trained to beat one another till the blood follows. They have another &s;ort of puni&s;hment with a Whip, which is much crueller, and inflicted by the hands of the Executioner, when the correction is publique. The Whip is made of the &s;kin of an Elke cut into &s;everal thongs, which pierces the skin in &s;uch manner, that at the very fir&s;t la&s;h it oftentimes leaves bloody impre&s;&s;ions behind it; their Capital puni&s;hment which they u&s;e commonly for tho&s;e that are condem|ned to die, scutting off their heads, and to ex|tort Evidences they u&s;e the <HI>Strapado.</HI></P>
<P>As for their Money, they have but one kind which they call <HI>Copeca,</HI> fifty of which make a Crown, 'tis of Silver, of an Oval figure, and &s;o &s;mall that the value of two Crowns will &s;carce bear the bulk of four pence in French Deniers; that which they call <HI>Mu&s;cofske</HI> is the fourth part of a <HI>Copeca, Poluske</HI> is the half, an <HI>Alim</HI> is three pence, a <HI>Grifna</HI> is ten, a <HI>Rou|ble</HI>
<PB N="69" REF="41">
a hundred, but the&s;e are not to be had of one piece.</P>
<P>There are two things further remarquable in the commune Society of the <HI>Mo&s;covites,</HI> one is that they begin their day at the ri&s;ing of the Sun, and end it at the &s;etting, &s;o that their Night begins as &s;oon as the Sun is down, and ends when it ri&s;es. By which means they con|found that which we call the Natural day with the Artificial, which extends it &s;elf from the ri&s;ing to the &s;etting of the Sun. The other is, that they begin their Year the fir&s;t day of <HI>September,</HI> as allowing no other Epoche than from the Creation of the World which they believe was in Autumn. And they reckon ac|cording to the opinion of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> five thou&s;and five hundred and eight Years from the Creation of the World, to the Nativity of our Saviour, whereas we accompt but three thou&s;and nine hundred and &s;ixty nine. So that in the Year of our Lord 1663 when we arrived in <HI>Mo&s;covie,</HI> they reckoned 7175 Years from the Creation, whil&s;t we accounted but 5686. Every fir&s;t day of the Year, they have great Proce&s;&s;ions in their con&s;iderable Townes.</P>
<P>And thus far we have given you the Po|licie
<PB N="70" REF="42">
or publique Comportment of the <HI>Mo&s;co|vite</HI> in the World: I &s;hall now give you &s;ome hints of their Religion.</P>
<P>The Religion of the <HI>Ru&s;&s;es</HI> is the &s;ame with the Profe&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> they follow their Faith, their Rites, and their Ceremonies. The principal part of their Devotion after they are Baptized, con&s;i&s;ts in the Invocation of their Saints. For every Family hath its Saint pictured, and hung up again&s;t the wall of the Chamber, with a &s;mall wax Candle before it, which they light when they make their Invocations. Their Churches al&s;o are all adorned with Pictures, very ill drawn, and in flat painting; for they will endure no b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ages embo&s;t. Over the Porch of their Churches, in their Market places, and over the Gates of their Cities, they have alwaies the picture of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> or their Patron St. <HI>Nicholas.</HI> And among&s;t them the&s;e Images are in &s;uch Veneration, that all that pa&s;s that way make a &s;tand for a while before them, till they have made Reverences to them five or &s;ix times one after another, which is performed by cro&s;&s;ing them&s;elves with three Fingers of their right Hand, and by &s;aying with a low voice, <HI>Go&s;podi Pomilui,</HI> which is as much as to &s;ay, <HI>God have mercy on me.</HI></P>
<P>They do addre&s;s them&s;elves with the &s;ame Veneration and Prayers to the Cro&s;&s;es they
<PB N="71" REF="42">
meet by the way, &s;o that they are ob&s;erved to &s;top them&s;elves every moment. And the&s;e profound Reverences to their Images, and the &s;igning them&s;elves with the Cro&s;s at the &s;ame time, and crying <HI>Go&s;podi Pomilui,</HI> is al|mo&s;t all the Devotions the Parents do teach their Children. When a <HI>Mo&s;covite</HI> enters into another Man's hou&s;e, he fir&s;t looks about for the Saint, and having paid his Reverence there, he turns about and &s;alutes the Family. When they buy any of the&s;e Images, they take great caution of &s;aying, they have bought them, but choo&s;e rather to &s;ay, they have changed them for Silver. When they grow old or rotten, they either bury them with &s;ome Ceremonie, or throw them into &s;ome River, and expo&s;e them to the mercy of the Current. In &s;hort, the &s;ign of the Cro&s;s is &s;o u&s;ual among&s;t them, that they are perpetual|ly at it, and do make it the ordinary preface of all their civil Actions.</P>
<P>On Sundays and their Fe&s;tival days, they go three times to Church, Morning, Noon, and Evening; and are &s;tanding and unco|vered all the time of Divine &s;ervice, for which rea&s;on, they have neither benches nor &s;eats in their Churches. The mo&s;t devout enter not into the Church, but perform their devo|tion at the door among&s;t the Women, who being lookt upon as more impure than the Men, have not &s;o ea&s;ie an admi&s;&s;ion as they. A
<PB N="72" REF="43">
per&s;on who that day hath had knowledge of his Wife, ought not to enter into the Church, till he hath wa&s;hed him&s;elf and put on a clean &s;hirt. They have no preaching among&s;t them, &s;o that their whole Service con&s;i&s;ts in the reading of certain P&s;almes or Chapters in the Bible by their Prie&s;t, and (up|on occa&s;ion) <HI>Athana&s;ius</HI> his Creed; or el&s;e they Sing their Prayers with a very high voice, and adding &s;ometimes after that a Ho|mily of St. <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tome.</HI> They &s;ay their Prayers &s;tanding, only when they come to the <HI>Go&s;podi,</HI> they bow their Heads to the very ground, beating it with their fore-head. And this is the whole Service of their Sun|days, in which many among&s;t them forbear not any labour or travail. As to their Fe&s;ti|vals, be&s;ides their Sundays, they ob&s;erve but fifteen, that is to &s;ay, the Nativity of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> on the eighth of <HI>September;</HI> the Exaltation of the Cro&s;s, the fourteenth of the &s;ame; the Oblation of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> the one and twentieth of <HI>November;</HI> the Nativity of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, the five and twentieth of <HI>December;</HI> the Epiphany or Fea&s;t of Kings on the &s;ixth of <HI>January;</HI> Can|delmas day, on the &s;econd of <HI>February;</HI> the Annuntiation of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> on the five and twentieth of <HI>March;</HI> Palm-Sunday, Ea|&s;ter-day, A&s;cen&s;ion-day, Whit-Sunday, the Fea&s;t of the Trinity next day after the Pente|co&s;t,
<PB N="73" REF="43">
All Saints-day the Sunday after, the Manife&s;tation of the Glory of Chri&s;t upon the Mountain, being the &s;ixth of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> and the A&s;cen&s;ion of the Virgin the fifteenth of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>If there be any Religion that obliges its Profe&s;&s;ors to a &s;evere Mortification, this mu&s;t needs be confe&s;t to do it with mo&s;t Rigour. For be&s;ides that they fa&s;t ordinarily on Wed|nes-days, Fridays, and the Eves before holy|days, they have four Lents every year. The longe&s;t of them is like ours, of &s;even weeks, there is another that begins Eight dayes after the Penteco&s;t and la&s;ts to St. <HI>Peters</HI> day, the third holds from the fir&s;t of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> to the &s;ixteenth, and the fourth from the twelfth of <HI>November</HI> till Chri&s;tmas day. During the&s;e Lents they Eat neither butter nor eggs nor milk, only the fir&s;t weeke of their chief Lent they have liberty for all kind of Exce&s;s, &s;ave eating of fle&s;h. And indeed in this week (which &s;erves them as a Carneval) their ex|travagancies are incredible, and as if their debauches were a preparative to their fa&s;ting, the in&s;olencies of drunken men are &s;uch, that at <HI>Mo&s;cow</HI> e&s;pecially, it is very un&s;afe walk|ing the &s;treets in the night. But after this week they live &s;o &s;oberly that the mo&s;t &s;trict of them eat no fi&s;h but on &s;undays, and drink nothing at all but <HI>Quaz</HI> or fair water. They content them &s;elves with pul&s;e, and hearbs,
<PB N="74" REF="44">
but above all with Garlick and Onyons, of which they &s;tink very enormou&s;ly all Lent long; only now and then they indulge and &s;weeten them&s;elves with hony. In the mean time the hu&s;band being not allowed the know|ledge of his wife, but tyed up from the plea&s;ures of matrimony, is &s;ubject as it were to double Lent, which is not to be tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ed under a years excommunication.</P>
<P>In their Confe&s;&s;ions they &s;tand upright be|fore their Images, and when the Prie&s;t gives them ab&s;olution, he obliges them to certain penancies; the greate&s;t of which are, that they ab&s;tain from <HI>aqua vitae,</HI> and from their wives, &s;o that many times it falls out, a woman is puni&s;ht for the &s;ins of her hu&s;band. Or el&s;e they enjoyn them when they come to Church to come no further than the Porch, to pro|nounce &s;o many times the <HI>Go&s;podi,</HI> to make &s;uch a number of reverences to their Saints, to wa&s;h them&s;elves with holy water, which is con&s;ecrated on the Epiphany, and which the Prie&s;ts know very well how to di&s;tribute for their own advantage.</P>
<P>They commonly take the Communion on a Fa&s;ting day at Noon &s;ervice, and if any one receives on a Sunday, he mu&s;t that day eat no Kind of fle&s;h. It is admini&s;tred in both Kinds with leavened bread, and wine mingled with warm water, which repre&s;ents the believers,
<PB N="75" REF="44">
or rather (according to a Councel of the Ea&s;t a&s;&s;embled at Con&s;tantinople) the water that came forth with the blood from the mo&s;t pretious &s;ide of our Saviour. There are none that receive in one kind only but chil|dren under &s;even years old, at which age as &s;oon as they are arrived, they are admitted to communicate in both: becau&s;e (&s;ay they) at that age they begin to &s;in Mortally. Some there are that will &s;leep as &s;oon as they have re|ceived, to prevent by that means any occa|&s;ion of &s;inning. If a Prie&s;t on the Communion-day happen to touch any dead Corps, or be pre&s;ent at any funerall, he is lookt upon as defiled, and can neither Con&s;ecrate nor Ad|mini&s;ter the Sacrament that day. But for what <HI>Oleareus</HI> alledges, that they believe a Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, I could not perceive any &s;uch thing. And I have three rea&s;ons that do principally per&s;wade me they are not yet fallen under &s;o great an Errour: The fir&s;t is, that when one di&s;cour&s;es with them about the con|&s;equences of that belief, they will own it to be irrationall, and declare it ab&s;urd and ridiculous, and they never betake them&s;elves (as the Catholicks do) to God's Omnipo|tencie to maintain it. The Second is, that if they did believe a reall Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, they would &s;how more re&s;pect than they do to that my&s;tery; and indeed it would be very &s;trange, if in a Religion &s;o preci&s;e and &s;uper|&s;titious
<PB N="76" REF="45">
as theirs, they &s;hould want Zeal and A|doration at a time wherein it ought to be mo&s;t Eminent as it is among&s;t the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks. And la&s;tly were they of this opinion, which <HI>Olearius</HI> imputs to them, it mu&s;t have bin de|rived to them from the <HI>Greeks,</HI> from whom they received the &s;cheme of their Religion, but neither do we find the <HI>Greeks</HI> under &s;o great a blindne&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the <HI>Mo&s;covites</HI> they have yearly many Proce&s;&s;ions, but the principall and mo&s;t &s;olemne is on Palme-&s;unday, by which is re|pre&s;ented our Saviours Entring into <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> They have Saints al&s;o that perform great miracles, if one will believe the &s;tories they tell of them. Among&s;t the Re&s;t, there is one of them called <HI>Serge,</HI> at <HI>Troitza,</HI> in the riche&s;t and mo&s;t beautifull Convent in all <HI>Mo&s;covy;</HI> in which place he lived formerly &s;o reli|giou&s;ly, that at la&s;t he wrought Miracles. He died in the year 1563. and yet as we pa&s;t by <HI>Troitza</HI> (which is a Town near <HI>Mo&s;cow</HI>) they told us his countenance was as fre&s;h as when he died. And to this Convent the <HI>Tzar</HI> does u&s;ually go in Pilgrimage twice every year, he comes on hor&s;eback within a league of the place, and then walks the re&s;t on foot.</P>
<P>The Religious or Mona&s;ticks eat no fle&s;h in their Convents, nor drink any thing but <HI>Quaz,</HI> but when they are out of their Con|vents,
<PB N="77" REF="45">
they have liberty to drink what they plea&s;e. In this Country a man may for&s;ake his Wife, and Children, and betake him&s;elf to a Convent; if a Woman be barren, her Hu&s;band hath power to quit him&s;elf of her, and di&s;po&s;e her into a Religious hou&s;e; and the <HI>Tzars</HI> them&s;elves when they have none but Daughters, do &s;erve theirs in the &s;ame kind. Moreover, he that can convince his Wife of fornication hath it at his choice to &s;have her and clap her up in a Nunnery, and marry again within &s;ix weeks after the Di|vorce. I call it <HI>Fornication</HI> and not <HI>Adultery,</HI> becau&s;e the <HI>Mo&s;covites</HI> believe there is no Adultery but marrying another mans wife.</P>
<P>They do not believe there is a Purgatorie, but they hold there are two di&s;tinct places where the Souls that are &s;eparated from their bodies do remain in expectation of the day of Judgment. One of them is the Man&s;ion of the Ble&s;&s;ed, where they enjoy (as they be|lieve) the conver&s;ation of Angels, with all &s;ort of Plea&s;ure and Delight; the Other of the Wicked, in a di&s;mal Valley, where they have no other a&s;&s;ociates but Divels. Not|with&s;tanding, they believe the Souls of the Wicked are not altogether uncapable of Comfort, but that by the prayers and the perfumes of their Prie&s;ts, they may be forced back out of the very jaws of Hell. And for this cau&s;e their Prie&s;ts will pray over their
<PB N="78" REF="46">
Sepulchers morning and night, for forty days, which is the term of their Mourning, in me|mory of their departed Friends; and on the Eve before the Penteco&s;t they perform cer|tain annuall Ceremonies in their behalf; which though very formal, are altogether mo&s;t ri|diculous.</P>
<P>In their Hierarchie, they have for their chief a Patriarch, elected by the <HI>Tzar,</HI> and it is this Patriarch that judges in all Cau&s;es Eccle&s;ia&s;ti|call, and di&s;po&s;es ab&s;olutely in all matters of Religion; He hath his pallace in <HI>Mo&s;co</HI> in the great Dukes Ca&s;tle. After him, there are &s;e|veral Metropolitans and Bi&s;hops, di&s;per&s;t into &s;undry parts of the Country. The re&s;t of the Clergy is compo&s;ed of Proto-popes, and Popes, or &s;imple Prie&s;ts, which are obliged (con|trary to all other Eccle&s;ia&s;ticall Per&s;ons) to marry before they receive Orders, but if their wife dies, they are to remaine widdowers as long as they live, becau&s;e (&s;ay they) the A|po&s;tle would have a Bi&s;hop to be the hu&s;band but of one wife in the 1 <HI>Tim. ch.</HI> 3: whereas Saint <HI>Pauls</HI> meaning is that a Bi&s;hop &s;hould have but one wife at a time, Poligamy being in his time a very Ordinary vice. And hence it is that one of the&s;e Prie&s;ts being a wid|dower is not permitted to admini&s;ter the Sa|crament, nor to marry, he has only liberty to a&s;&s;i&s;t at Morning and Everning &s;ervice, not at Noon, at which time they u&s;ually Com|municate
<PB N="79" REF="46">
as I have &s;aid before. Neverthele&s;s, if one of the&s;e Prie&s;t be un&s;atisfied with his Condition, he may freely relinqui&s;h his charge, and lay by his ve&s;t and his Cap which they put upon him at his Con&s;ecration, and after that become a Mechanick if he thinks it for his advantage.</P>

<P>HAving given a &s;ufficient de&s;cription of <HI>Mo&s;covie,</HI> it is time we return now to &s;peak againe of our Voiage; But before we leave <HI>Archangel,</HI> it will be convenient to &s;ay &s;omething of the Town, and that little Re&s;idence we made there.</P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Archangel</HI> (&s;o called from St. <HI>Michael</HI> the Arch-angel) is &s;ituated on the bank of the River <HI>Duina,</HI> on the left hand as you pa&s;s from the <HI>White</HI> Sea. When we were there it was not very great, but yet &s;o po|pulous by rea&s;on of the great trading thither, that it was &s;carce capable of all the Inha|bitants. And indeed it is in re&s;pect of the Commerce e&s;pecially, that this Town is &s;o con&s;iderable; for hither it is that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &amp; the <HI>Hollander,</HI> among&s;t other Commodities, tran&s;port Cloth, Velvets, Damask, Spices, Tinn, Lead, Wine, and &s;trong Waters. But becau&s;e
<PB N="80" REF="47">
the <HI>Mo&s;covites</HI> &s;wallow down &s;mall Wines like River water, therefore they &s;end them no <HI>French</HI> nor <HI>Rheni&s;h</HI> Wines, as being not &s;trong enough for them. On the <HI>Mo&s;covites</HI> &s;ide there is great &s;tore of Corn exported, of Cavyar, Furs, Hemp, Ru&s;&s;ia-leather, and Wax. It is above an hundred years &s;ince this trade was brought hither by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> from <HI>Narve,</HI> in the time of <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;ixth King of <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Ivan Ba&s;ilovitz</HI> Emperour of <HI>Mo&s;covie.</HI></P>
<P>For <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;ixth having &s;et out a Fleet, for the e&s;tabli&s;hing a Trade in &s;ome un|known Country, the Fleet having followed the Northern pa&s;&s;age, was at length brought into this Port. And hence it was that <HI>Ivan Ba&s;ilovitz</HI> (to recompence the generous de|&s;igns of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who&s;e pains and indu&s;try had opened a Trade into the&s;e parts) gave them a Priviledge of Commerce to that Town without any Cu&s;tome or Impo&s;t. And this was the occa&s;ion upon which the great Amity betwixt the two Crowns was e&s;tabli&s;hed, to the no &s;mall Advantage both of the one and the other.</P>
<P>After we, that made our Voyage in the Merchant-man, were arrived at <HI>Archangel,</HI> his Excellence inquired particularly into the cau|&s;es of our delay, and of Mr. <HI>Wat&s;ons</HI> de&s;er|tion, who was parted from us. Upon which the Ma&s;ter of the Ship made a great Apology
<PB N="81" REF="47">
for him&s;elf, laying the fault upon the winds, and taking occa&s;ion of Mr. <HI>Wat&s;on's</HI> ab&s;ence, he accu&s;ed him al&s;o (be&s;ides many particu|lar points) of being partly the cau&s;e that our Expedition had been no greater. But it was an&s;wered &s;ufficiently again&s;t the Ma&s;ters Ca|lumnies, both by the Sea-men and us. And indeed had the Ma&s;ter come to an harbour either in <HI>Norway</HI> or <HI>Scotland,</HI> as he was often de&s;ired by Mr. <HI>Wat&s;on,</HI> rather than &s;tay till the Ship was brui&s;ed to pieces to get her repaired in <HI>England,</HI> &s;ixty or &s;eventy Leagues out of our way, it is very likely we might have been two or three Weeks &s;ooner at our Port. And &s;o it was doubtle&s;s rather the Ma&s;ter of the Ships than Ma&s;ter <HI>Wat&s;ons</HI> fault, that we had &s;tayed &s;o long behind my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador, and that his Excellency had not only the apprehen&s;ion we &s;hould have been ca&s;t away, but the continuation of his Voiage differred very long, to &s;ome great di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>However, while the Amba&s;&s;ador &s;tayed at <HI>Archangel,</HI> he had all manner of good Enter|tainment, which ta&s;ted very plea&s;ant to us, who newly had made an end of a long and very hard Voiage among&s;t the troubles of the Sea. Therefore we took our good &s;hare of it, and in the mean time we took al&s;o a view of the Town while we had opportu|nity,
<PB N="82" REF="48">
during one Weeks time his Excellency &s;tayed in it &s;ince our arrival. As for the En|tertainment given us in this Town, it was in|deed &s;o great and plentiful with all kind of Provi&s;ion, that we wanted nothing but a great number of Cooks to get it dre&s;&s;ed, and more People to con&s;ume it. And that we took to be a good Omen for the re&s;t of our Travails tho|rough that Country: but we were mi&s;taken in it, for we experienced the contrary in &s;eve|ral places upon a very bad account. How&s;oe|ver the Amba&s;&s;adors meat was alwaies dre&s;&s;ed after the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI> way by his own Cooks, and all the bread that was eaten at his Table, was made al&s;o by his own Baker. What was eaten be&s;ides, was after the <HI>Mo&s;covite</HI> fa&s;hion which &s;eemed at fir&s;t &s;omething &s;trange to us, for they bake it in &s;uch manner that it hath &s;carce any cru&s;t at all. As for Drink, we were plentifully provided with Beer, Mead, <HI>Aqua-vitae,</HI> divers &s;orts of Wines, and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> among&s;t the re&s;t. The Amba&s;&s;adors from the <HI>Tzar,</HI> who about two moneths before had arrived at <HI>Archangel</HI> from <HI>London,</HI> had with|out que&s;tion given us fair recommendation by the report they had publi&s;hed at this Town, and thorough the whole Road to <HI>Mo&s;co,</HI> of the extraordinary Reception which had been given them by the King of great <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>Here I &s;hall take the liberty of &s;peaking &s;ome|thing of the People called <HI>Samojedes,</HI> up|on
<PB N="83" REF="48">
occa&s;ion of &s;ome of them that we &s;aw at <HI>Archangel.</HI> They are of a Country very bar|barous, but under the <HI>Tzars</HI> dominion, and of a long time in&s;tructed in the Religion of the <HI>Greeks.</HI> Their Habitation is under the frozen Zone, near the antient <HI>Scythia,</HI> toward the <HI>Ryphean</HI> or <HI>Hyperborean</HI> Mountains, which are next neighbours to <HI>Petzora</HI> which I have mentioned before. The word <HI>Samojedes</HI> denotes what they have formerly been, <HI>viz. Anthropophagi</HI> or &s;uch as eat mansfle&s;h: for <HI>Samojedes</HI> is compo&s;ed of <HI>Sam</HI> which &s;ignifies ones &s;elf, and <HI>Jeda</HI> which &s;ignifies to eat; and indeed they did u&s;e to eat the bodies of their dead friends with Veni&s;on. The Sun (that robs them of his pre&s;ence in their Contry five or &s;ix Months every year) obligeth them to make provi&s;ion in &s;ummer of whatever is ne|ce&s;&s;ary for their livelyhood in &s;o tedious an ob&s;curity; again&s;t which they have no better remedy than the brightne&s;s of their lamps, which are fed with a certain oyl drawn out of Fi&s;h. It is reported that their hou&s;es are built half way under ground, and that for their mutual conver&s;ation in winter, they are forced to make trenches in &s;tead of &s;heets, and that in &s;ummer time they march out from their impri&s;onment at their Chimneys. Their Common &s;u&s;tenance is Veni&s;on, honey, or a certaine fi&s;h dried in the Wind or the Sun, without any bread at all. They wear a Kind
<PB N="84" REF="49">
of Ve&s;t half way down their legs which they make of Buck &s;kins or the &s;kins of Rein Deer with the Furrs turned outwards. The&s;e Ve&s;ts have no other parts open than the bottom by which they get into them, and the upper part where they put out their face, for they cover the head with it as the <HI>Capuchinos</HI> do: but the cap has the &s;ame fa&s;hion with the head of a Man. At the end of their &s;leevs they have their Muffs Sown half on, that they may have it at their choice, to make u&s;e of them or let them hang loo&s;e as they have occa&s;ion. They wear Bootes, but with the Furr on the out&s;ide, which Garb appears &s;o horrid, that it is a hard matter at fir&s;t &s;ight not to be frighted to &s;ee them habited in furs like &s;avage Bea&s;ts. Under their Ve&s;ts they wear &s;hirts made of the &s;kins of young Reine Deer which are much &s;ofter than linnen, and under tho&s;e &s;hirts Drawers. They u&s;e al&s;o a very large &s;ort of Bonnets which hang down round about their &s;houl|ders, and are commonly made of cloth and lined with furr. Their Stature is but low, their Faces flatt and broad like the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and their Hair long. Two or three of the&s;e <HI>Samojedes</HI> were brought to his Excellency, with whom he entertained him&s;elf for &s;ome time with &s;everal que&s;tions which he a&s;kt them touching their manner of living.

<P>The Preparation his Excellence made for his Voiage up the River con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ix barges or great boates for his train and baggage, of which one was &s;et apart for his Kitchin, and a hearth and Chimney contrived in it; and an other for his Coach hor&s;es. Be&s;ides the&s;e &s;ix there was one Barque peculiar to the <HI>Pri&s;taff,</HI> who re&s;olved to carry his wife along with him.

<HEAD>Of his Excellencies Voiage from <HI>Arch|angel</HI> to <HI>Vologda,</HI> upon the Rivers of <HI>Duina</HI> and <HI>Sucagna.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ON Saturday the twelfth of <HI>September</HI> his Excellence departed from <HI>Archangel</HI> with all his Train, and came the next day to <HI>Colmogro,</HI> and on the nineteenth to <HI>Ar&s;inoa,</HI> which is two hundred and fifty Ver&s;ts (every Ver&s;t being the fourth part of a League) from <HI>Archangel.</HI> On the two and twentieth we parted from <HI>Ar&s;inoa,</HI> and on the &s;even and twentieth arrived at <HI>Yagri&s;h</HI> one hundred and thirty long Ver&s;ts, and from <HI>Yagri&s;h</HI> to <HI>&V;&s;tiga,</HI> which is one hundred and fifty Ver&s;ts in five days. The third of <HI>October</HI> we left <HI>&V;&s;tiga</HI> (which is almo&s;t half way betwixt <HI>Archangel</HI> and <HI>Vologda</HI>) and on the twelfth arrived at <HI>Tetma,</HI> which from <HI>&V;&s;tiga</HI> is two hundred and fifty Ver&s;ts.

<P><PB N="87" REF="50">We made no u&s;e of Hor&s;es for the haleing our Barques from <HI>Archangel</HI> to <HI>Vologda,</HI> but (notwith&s;tanding it was up the River) we performed all with men, &s;o that ordinarily we had no le&s;s than three hundred with us. The River is not very rapid but in certain pla|ces, where we were &s;ometimes con&s;trained to imploy the Water-men of two boats for drawing up a &s;ingle one again&s;t the oppo&s;ition of the &s;tream. But his Excellence fearing (and not without rea&s;on) the River would freez before we could fini&s;h our Voiage, he entrea|ted the <HI>Pri&s;taf Bogdan</HI> to go before, that we might have fre&s;h watermen ready at our arri|val in every relay; &amp; that all nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;i|ons being provided before hand, we might have no occa&s;ion lo lo&s;e our time. But this care was very ill &s;econded by our Pilots, who ran us &s;everal times upon ground, &s;o that &s;ome|times we &s;pent two or three hours in di&s;en|gaging a boat from the Rocks. And &s;ome|times we received &s;o horrible concu&s;&s;ions, that it was a wonder the barque was not broke to pieces under us, and this gave one occa&s;ion to &s;ay, that peradventure the Boats did break the Rocks. In the night time ordina|rily the Boat-men made fires in the Woods, as if they would have &s;et all <HI>Mo&s;covie</HI> on fire, and when they had done, laid them&s;elves down by it to &s;leep very civilly upon the banks of the River.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="51">We had alwaies very good provi&s;ion of Victuals, and e&s;pecially of &s;trong Waters, of Wine, Mead, and Quaz, of which we laded a barque at <HI>Archangel</HI> to &s;erve us the whole Voiage. The Barque which we had made our Kitchin, furni&s;hed all the re&s;t with meat, and in particular his Excellencies, by getting them clo&s;e one to another, in &s;uch a manner, that tho&s;e that were in the Amba&s;&s;ador's Ve&s;&s;el received the di&s;hes from the hands of the Cooks, to carry them two or three &s;teps to his Table: Whereas the other boats were glad to make u&s;e of their skifs to fetch their provi&s;ion dayly.</P>
<P>In this Voiage Walking was our greate&s;t Recreation, for whil&s;t our barques were drawn by the men, and advanced but a &s;mall pace, we went a-&s;hore in our skifs. The Sha|dows and Umbrages which the continual Fore&s;ts ca&s;t upon the River, the excellent Verdure wherewith they were adorned all the way, together with the favourablene&s;s of the Weather invited us to it, and many times made us lo&s;e all &s;en&s;e of wearine&s;s; &s;ometimes al&s;o we had the diver&s;ion of Shooting, by rea&s;on of the many wild Ducks and Pigeons that <HI>Mo&s;covie</HI> is provided with.

<PB N="89" REF="51">
it is built of wood, as the re&s;t are, and paved only with piles of Firr. True it is here we had now and then liberty to &s;ee their Churches, which in <HI>Mo&s;co</HI> they will not permit to Stran|gers of another Religion, for they believe them profaned, when any &s;uch &s;et their feet in them. Betwixt <HI>Archangel</HI> and <HI>&V;&s;tiga</HI> we &s;aw &s;everal Rocks of Alaba&s;ter, or white Marble, as we pa&s;&s;ed upon the River.</P>
<P>This being the manner of our Voiage, it remains now that we pre&s;ent you with &s;ome circum&s;tances that happened in our Naviga|tion.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t of all it was u&s;ual as we pa&s;t by any Village, to have the Prie&s;t come to his Excellencies boat, with a pre&s;ent of Fi&s;h, au|tumnal Goo&s;e-berries, or &s;ometimes a Hen with &s;ome few Eggs, in hopes of receiving &s;ome reward from the Amba&s;&s;ador: And drinking <HI>Aqua vitae,</HI> which they gu&s;led down with &s;o much plea&s;ure, they commonly went home again drunk.</P>
<P>The next day after we parted from <HI>Arch|angel,</HI> the <HI>Pri&s;taf</HI> brought his Wife into the Amba&s;&s;adors barque. She was very richly dre&s;&s;ed with Pearls and precious Stones, and (had &s;he not been painted) might have pa&s;t for very hand&s;om; however his Excellence vouch&s;afed to honour her with a Salute, and
<PB N="90" REF="52">
entertained her with great Civility, pre&s;enting her according to the cu&s;tome of the place with a Cup of <HI>Aqua vitae,</HI> till Dinner came in. Within a little time after &s;he was unhappily deprived of her Hu&s;band, for being arrived at <HI>&V;&s;tiga,</HI> he found him&s;elf &s;ei&s;ed with a di&s;temper which in a &s;hort time ended both his Life and Voiage.</P>
<P>Being arrived near <HI>Ar&s;inoa</HI> the Amba&s;&s;ador expecting to have found boat-men ready for his departure, was con&s;trained him&s;elf to provide them, after he had attended three whole days. The Governour of this Town had had adverti&s;ement from the Governour of <HI>Archangel</HI> to have all things ready in good time, and the like notice he had al&s;o from the <HI>Pri&s;taf;</HI> but he de&s;pi&s;ed all, and ranted (as if he had been in a frenzy) again&s;t all &s;uch as were employed in the bu&s;ine&s;s, re&s;olving the Amba&s;&s;ador &s;hould go back if he plea&s;ed, rather than he would be troubled with any thing. So that his Excellence was nece&s;&s;itated at his own proper charges to hire &s;ome of the Water-men that had brought us from <HI>Colmogro</HI> to carry us to <HI>Yagri&s;h,</HI> and to en|gage the re&s;t at <HI>Ar&s;inoa.</HI> In the mean while we &s;aw a Wolf upon the bank of the Ri|ver running up and down, which &s;ome fancied was the Governour dre&s;&s;ed in that di&s;gui&s;e, to take a view of the Amba&s;&s;ador and his train. We clapt &s;ome dogs after him imme|diately,
<PB N="91" REF="52">
but he ran the foile &s;o cunningly, that we lo&s;t him in a moment.</P>
<P>On the 26. of <HI>September</HI> at Night there was an unlucky accident befel fifteen of our boat|men, who put them&s;elves in a huddle into a skif to come to one of the barques, and falling down the River &s;uffered their boat to be carried away by the &s;tream with that violence, that it fell foul upon one of the barques, and was overturned, and &s;even of the fifteen were drowned, the re&s;t &s;aving them&s;elves by &s;wimming. Another time one of our water-men fell off the Decks into the River, and having no skill in &s;wimming, he was in the greate&s;t danger of the World; But as he was ju&s;t &s;inking, a Boat was pre|&s;ently di&s;patched, which took him up, and after he had drunk two or three good draughts of &s;trong Waters, he found him&s;elf very well again. Which made me imagine that had the water of the River been <HI>Aqua vitae,</HI> he would have thought they had done him a great injury to pre&s;erve him, and would rather have cho&s;e to have died with that plenty than to have lived in want of it. About this time al&s;o we received the News that <HI>Archangel</HI> was burnt, and almo&s;t all reduced into a&s;hes pre&s;ently after our de|parture.</P>
<P>The Governor of <HI>&V;&s;tiga</HI> expre&s;&s;ed great Civilities to my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador, and was

clearly of another humour than the Governor of <HI>Ar&s;inoa;</HI> yet it was without violating a Cu|&s;tom they have to &s;ee no forreign Amba&s;&s;adors them&s;elves. Neverthele&s;&s;e he tendred his &s;ervice and all that he was able to do by one of his Gentelmen, and provided us abund|antly with all things nece&s;&s;ary for our Voiage by the means of two hone&s;t Officers which he deputed <HI>Pri&s;taffs</HI> in the place of <HI>Bogdan</HI> lately decea&s;ed. For this rea&s;on his Excellence would not depart from thence till he had made him &s;ome acknowledgment, and pre|&s;ented him by one of his Gentlemen with three douzain bottels of Canary and French wine. We &s;tayed only two days in this Town, and from thence made all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;t becau&s;e the Rever began to be frozen. At this time every of our barques having two Ma&s;ts, one for our Sayles and another for our Ropes, we were fain to cut our Sayls Ma&s;t to make our barques the lighter; for betwixt <HI>&V;&s;tiga</HI> and <HI>Vologda,</HI> they cannot in tho&s;e large Boats upon the River <HI>Sucagna</HI> (which runs into the <HI>Duina</HI> hard by) make u&s;e of their Sayles by rea&s;on of the great number of Rocks betwixt <HI>&V;&s;tiga,</HI> and <HI>Tetma.</HI> His Excellence to lighten his Ve&s;&s;el yet more, left there a hundred In|gots or Rigs of lead, for notwith&s;tanding it was &s;till haled with three&s;core and ten men, it ne|verthele&s;s went the mo&s;t heaviely of them all, becau&s;e of its bulk and freight. For be&s;ides
<PB N="93" REF="53">
&s;even or eight boatmen who guided it, there were always aboard the &s;ame thirty per&s;ons, be&s;ides a great quantity of Goods, which was the cau&s;e that &s;everal in that Ve&s;&s;el were very narrowly lodged. This Lead above|mentioned was de&s;igned among&s;t the re&s;t of the pre&s;ents for the <HI>Tzar</HI> which the King of <HI>England</HI> &s;ent him, and for that purpo&s;e was brought to his Excellence a little after our arrival at <HI>Vologda,</HI></P>
<P>And now by this time the Winter was &s;o farr advanced, that our Voiage began to be grievous and in&s;upportable; for there being no Convenience for fire to warm our &s;elves we had no relief but from our furrs, and &s;trong waters (which we began to take down in good lu&s;ty draughts) or el&s;e by walking, although the ground was already covered with &s;now. In&s;omuch that in a &s;hort time we were all in our Robes, &s;ome like <HI>Mo&s;co|vites,</HI> others like the <HI>Samojedes,</HI> and &s;ome of them in their Sheep-&s;kin Ve&s;ts with long &s;leeves, re&s;embling tho&s;e old and eternal De|&s;tinies, whom <HI>Venus</HI> did &s;o laugh at when &s;he &s;aw them in their habits, tho&s;e like the <HI>Sa|mojedes</HI> looking &s;o hideou&s;ly that we made a good &s;port with them. At length we found the fro&s;t increa&s;ing by degrees, &s;o that at our parting from <HI>Rou&s;ea</HI> we found the River &s;o frozen to <HI>Vologda</HI> about twenty miles, that we were forced to break the ice
<PB N="94" REF="54">
before our fir&s;t Ve&s;&s;el which guided the re&s;t in the way.</P>
<P>At <HI>Tetma</HI> we were no &s;ooner arrived but the Governor came, though it was night, to &s;alute the Amba&s;&s;ador; who &s;urpri&s;ed with the unu&s;ualne&s;s of his civility, received him with great courte&s;y and treated him in his Barque. The Governor was in his per&s;on like a <HI>Boyar,</HI> thick, and fat, and corpulent, as mo&s;t of the Governors of Provinces generally are; otherwi&s;e he was a plea&s;ant man, good company, and very richly clad. He expre&s;t great civilities to the Amba&s;&s;ador, tendring his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in any thing which lay in his power, in acknowledgment whereof his Excellence &s;ent him a pre&s;ent the next morn|ing of three Els of &s;carlet cloth by Mr. <HI>Taylor</HI> his Steward.

His Excellence being gone, Mr. <HI>Taylor</HI> prepared to entertain him, and con&s;pired with &s;ome other Gentlemen who were in his boat to try whether the Governors head were able to bear a lu&s;ty cup or no.

<HEAD>Of his Excellencies Re&s;idence in the Town of <HI>Vologda.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Vologda</HI> is the chief City of a Province of the &s;ame name, it is very con&s;ide|rable both in re&s;pect of its bigne&s;s, and of a &s;trong &s;tone wall which &s;urrounds it. The River makes it a place of great trading, there|fore very populous. It is &s;ituate on the right hand of the River, like <HI>&V;&s;tiga, Colmogro,</HI> and <HI>Tetma,</HI> all rai&s;ed upon the banks, and the River running under them.</P>
<P>Our Lodgings were taken up in the Suburbs of the Town near the Rivers &s;ide: but the hou&s;es there being &s;mall and uncapable of &s;uch a number, we were forced to take up &s;ix or &s;even more, and lye di&s;per&s;ed about the Town. In this po&s;ture we continued three months in this place; contrary to his Excel|lencies de&s;ign, who was to pa&s;s immediately to <HI>Mo&s;co,</HI> as &s;oon as it was po&s;&s;ible for him to travail in Sledges: and therefore he re|&s;olved to attend, till the fro&s;t hardning the &s;now &s;hould make the ways pa&s;&s;able. At our fir&s;t coming we did not think to &s;tay above a month, the ground having been a long time covered with &s;now, and the aire in appearance di&s;po&s;ed to freez it well. Yet after our arrival the weather proved &s;o moi&s;t,
<PB N="96" REF="55">
that in a &s;hort time we &s;aw the ground unco|vered, and the River giving free pa&s;&s;age to the Boats. So that in the mean while we pa&s;&s;ed our time very ill, in re&s;pect of the raine and dirt, which was &s;o great, that for the &s;pace of a month or five weeks, we &s;carce ever dur&s;t &s;et a foot in the Streets. But that which was an Aggravation of our trouble, was an impatience we all had to be at <HI>Mo&s;co,</HI> and indeed it was a hard matter for us to be &s;a|tisfied in a Town that kept us &s;o long from that where his Excellencies Emba&s;&s;ie to the <HI>Tzar</HI> determined, and where we hoped to have a happy repo&s;e. In the mean time from the fir&s;t day of our arrival we began to warm our chambers with our furnaces of &s;tone, which is indeed a very convenient invention in &s;o cold a Country: but not being able to endure them to that degree of heat the <HI>Mo&s;|covites</HI> do, we were fain to u&s;e them with more moderation.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t our Entertainment was very good, and regulated as the Amba&s;&s;ador plea&s;ed; &s;o that we had plenty enough of all things, and yet nothing &s;uperfluous. But as Soon as <HI>Ne&s;trof</HI> and <HI>Davidof</HI> (which the <HI>Tzar</HI> had &s;ent from his Court in the quality of <HI>Pri&s;tafs</HI> to con|duct his Excellence to <HI>Mo&s;co</HI>) were arrived at <HI>Vologda</HI> in the Month of <HI>December,</HI> our diet and accommodation was &s;o altered and re|trenched that there could be nothing more

mean and di&s;honourable. <HI>Ne&s;trof,</HI> was a <HI>Stol|nick</HI> (which is as much as to &s;ay, a Gentleman waiting at the <HI>Tzars</HI> Table) the other was a <HI>Diack</HI> (which is an office importing &s;ome|thing higher than a Secretary, but lower than a Chancellor) <HI>Ne&s;trof</HI> was he that took all upon him, managed the whole Oeconomie, and made all things depend upon his own conduct. His arrogance had no bounds in all his actions, nor was it le&s;s remarquable in his languages: he was a per&s;on like him&s;elf in every thing, and little cared to di&s;&s;emble him|&s;elf a civil man. This was the form of his Complement to the Amba&s;&s;ador the next day after his arrival, having with a grave impu|dence and au&s;tere brow entered the Hall, where his Excellence received them; <HI>The mo&s;t Serene</HI> (&s;aies he) <HI>and Pui&s;&s;ant Great Lord, Tzar and Grand Duke, Alexey Michailovitz,</HI> (with a long enumeration of Titles, which had been Trea&s;on in him to have omitted) <HI>is very joyful to under&s;tand that you the great Amba&s;&s;ador of his Maje&s;tie of Great Brittain, &amp;c. are &s;o happily arrived here, and hath commanded, that We and your Excellence go together to Mo&s;co.</HI> Not contenting him&s;elf to &s;ay bluntly, <HI>the Tzar had commanded him</HI> (de&s;igning thereby to bring the Amba&s;&s;ador under the <HI>Tzar's</HI> command) with yet higher <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ncivility he preferred his own per&s;on and his a&s;&s;ociates before his Excellence, when he

<PB N="99" REF="56">
and the Hopes we had of departing &s;ud|dainly for <HI>Mo&s;co,</HI> where our condition was like to be much better.</P>
<P>The affaires of our Hou&s;e being thus e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, the Amba&s;&s;ador took particular care of our Devotions. He appointed the Chap|lain to read Prayers twice a day, and that there &s;hould be a Sermon every Sunday. He commanded all his dome&s;tiques to be con|&s;tantly pre&s;ent at the &s;ame, the Catholicks only excepted, in which number he had four <HI>French</HI> men: the Chirurgeon, the Confecti|oner, and two Cooks. The&s;e had all their liberty of Con&s;cience, but it was very &s;eldom they made u&s;e of it. At Chri&s;tmas we recei|ved the Communion.</P>
<P>Among&s;t all the Diverti&s;ements we had in this Town (be&s;ides mu&s;ique, dancing, and &s;ome other Recreations we u&s;ed at home, during the rain, to divert the tediou&s;ne&s;s of the time) Hunting was our be&s;t and mo&s;t u&s;ual entertainment, when the Snow was fro|zen upon the ground. Our Mu&s;ique was mo&s;t commonly at Dinner, at which time there was nothing to be heard but Trumpets and Viols, who&s;e delightful and agreeable Harmo|ny, did &s;ometimes &s;o charm the <HI>Ru&s;&s;es,</HI> that it drew great Company of them to hear it. And indeed the Mu&s;ique was very good, be|ing managed by one of the be&s;t experienced Mu&s;icians of <HI>England,</HI> who from time to
<PB N="100" REF="57">
time compo&s;ed new aires. Our dancing al&s;o, which the Amba&s;&s;ador u&s;ed &s;ometimes upon occa&s;ion of this Mu&s;ique, was no le&s;s admired by them, who in their Dances knew nothing but bruti&s;h and uncomely Po&s;tures, But when the River was &s;topt up to the boats, and the Snow was frozen upon the ground, which was not till the latter end of <HI>November,</HI> Hare-hunting was our principal &s;port, of which Creatures we found &s;uch plenty, that we could very well entertain our &s;elves among&s;t them from morning till night; and then we went a hunting in our Sledges. But they that knew how to march upon their Scates, did al&s;o divert them&s;elves with &s;liding upon the River. Moreover the Baths were grown very familiar among&s;t us, for be&s;ides the plea&s;ure, we found great refre&s;hment by them. We had al&s;o the Celebration of &s;everal Fe&s;tivals, but principally of the fifth of <HI>Novem|ber,</HI> which we kept in Memory of the happy Di&s;covery of the Trea&s;on contrived again&s;t King <HI>James</HI> at <HI>London.</HI> We began our Solem|nity in the night by artificial fire-works, made by an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> with great &s;kill and &s;ucce&s;s; and the &s;ame was continued by a great Fea&s;t which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants were invited to, and by a plea&s;ant farce of Ma&s;carads after Supper, and concluded with dancing.</P>
<P>And thus have you &s;een the manner of our
<PB N="101" REF="57">
living during our Re&s;idence at <HI>Vologda:</HI> I &s;hall now pre&s;ent you with &s;ome particular circum&s;tances, before I proceed to the De|&s;cription of our Voiage betwixt <HI>Vologda</HI> and <HI>Mo&s;co.</HI></P>
<P>Although Tobacco be forbidden in this Country with great &s;everity, yet there were &s;ome of the Amba&s;&s;adors Servants who drove a private Trade with it in this Town, and that with &s;o much advantage, that &s;ometimes they &s;old the mo&s;t ordinarie tobacco (which co&s;t them in <HI>London</HI> not above nine pence or ten pence the pound) for fifteen &s;hillings the pound to the <HI>Mo&s;covites,</HI> who &s;tole to them with great &s;ecrecy to buy it. It is a Commo|dity they love &s;o well in tho&s;e parts, that if they want mony they will truck their &s;hirts for tobacco: which they take &s;o bruti&s;hly that I was almo&s;t frighted to &s;ee &s;uch of them as waited on the Amba&s;&s;ador &s;moaking it when they had opportunity. In&s;tead of Pipes they have an Engine made of a Cows horn, in the middle of which they pierce a hole and therein place the Ve&s;&s;el which holds their tobacco. The Ve&s;&s;el is commonly made of wood, very wide and indifferently deep, which when they have filled with tobacco, they put water into the horn to temper the &s;moak; then they lighten their pipe with a firebrand, and &s;uck the &s;moak thorough the horn with &s;uch greedine&s;s, that they make not above
<PB N="102" REF="58">
two &s;ucks of a pipe; and when they whiffe it out of their mouths, they rai&s;e &s;uch a cloud that it hides all their face; and immediatly after they fall drunk upon the ground. Five or &s;ix of them one after another have I &s;een tumbling in this manner, and &s;o drunk that they had &s;carce time to give their Com|panions theis pipes, and for half a quarter of an hour they will ly in this pickle as in&s;en|&s;ible as if they had the falling &s;ickne&s;s. But a&s;&s;oon as they begin to revive, and the &s;moak of the tobacco hath had its operation, they leap up in an in&s;tant one after another more bri&s;k and lively than they were before, pro|nouncing it a mo&s;t admirable invention for purging the head. Red cloth, and Grey e&s;pe|cially are of that e&s;teem in this Town, that &s;ome of us could hardly forbear &s;elling our cloaths off our backs, to accomodate them.</P>
<P>In the mean time his Excellencies family was increa&s;t by the birth of a &s;on, of which the Buttlers wife was brought to bed, having been big with child before &s;he came out from <HI>London.</HI> But the Parents being both Catho|licks, and the child to be educated in that way, our Mini&s;ter made &s;ome difficulty to bapti&s;e it, as not being born within our pale. Yet upon Con&s;ultation concerning the matter it was judged nece&s;&s;ary it &s;hould be Chri&s;tned pre&s;ently, rather than have its bapti&s;m &s;u&s;pended, in regard that as to the
<PB N="103" REF="58">
e&s;&s;ence of the Sacrament, both Prote&s;tants &amp; Roman Catholicks, do hold our admini&s;tra|tion of it &s;ufficient, and upon that &s;core both the one &s;ide and the other receive their pro&s;elites without Injunction of being rebap|ti&s;ed. And thus his Excellencies family re|pre&s;ented a Commonwealth rather than a private hou&s;e, &s;ome laying there the foun|dation of their Marriage, as the good man that hurt him&s;elf in the Merchant-man at <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> &s;ome conceiving with child whil&s;t others were delivered, and this very woman happen'd to &s;erve as a Nur&s;e, when the Counte&s;s (who accompanied My Lord Amba&s;&s;ador) was brought to bed of a &s;on at <HI>Copenhagen</HI> in <HI>Denmark.</HI> So that at length there were three or four families comprehended in Ours; we married, we Chri&s;tened in our hou&s;e, we heard &s;ermons there, and received the Sacrament; our Chaplain was Bi&s;hop and Mini&s;ter, he was the only per&s;on and all, that managed the affaires of our Church.</P>
<P>During our &s;tay here, there happened a Quarrel al&s;o betwixt two con&s;iderable &s;er|vants in his Excellencies train, at an enter|tainment made him by the Pri&s;taf at a Coun|try hou&s;e of his, two or three miles from <HI>Vo|logda.</HI> For his Excellence &s;etting out late to return back to the Town, one of them fell in as clo&s;e as he could to the Amba&s;&s;adors per|&s;on, who was then attended with &s;ixteen &s;led|ges,
<PB N="104" REF="59">
the other who was but then preparing to depart being come up to him, fell foul upon the former with de&s;ign to quarrel with him, and nothing could &s;erve his turn but he mu&s;t &s;top his &s;ledg, that he him&s;elf might go before him according to his place. The other not at all plea&s;ed with &s;o &s;trange a dealing, refu&s;ed him and gave him withall ill language. Upon this they both betook them&s;elves to their &s;words and leaping on &s;hore they fell pre|&s;ently to fight. But the Amba&s;&s;ador having the alarm came pre&s;ently in, and &s;eeing how defi|cient they had bin in their re&s;pect to his per&s;on, he u&s;ed them both &s;everely. However every one lamented the ill fortune of the a&s;&s;ailant, who appeared to have ingaged in this bu&s;ines upon a publique accompt, and made u&s;e of this only as an occa&s;ion; the other being an imperious per&s;on, and one that (by rea&s;on of his long relation to his Excellence with had gained him &s;ome favours) &s;eemed to de&s;pi&s;e the whole family. And indeed nothing but his long &s;tanding in that family could be the ground of all his pre&s;umption, for of his other qualities there was no body believed he had any rea&s;on to boa&s;t.</P>
<P>In the 18. of <HI>December</HI> we &s;aw that &s;trange repre&s;entation, that is annually made by the <HI>Mo&s;covites</HI> of the fiery furnace in which <HI>Sha|drech, Me&s;ec,</HI> and <HI>Abednego</HI> were ca&s;t by the King of <HI>Babilon.</HI> The Per&s;ons that act in it are

di&s;gui&s;ed, their beards rubbed over with honey, their hats of wood with which they run up and down the &s;treets, and with wild fire in their hand burn the hair or beard of any body they meet, with great in&s;olence. During this Extravagance the <HI>Mo&s;covites</HI> look upon them as &s;o many Pagans and profane per&s;ons, but on the fea&s;t of Kings they baptize them again, becau&s;e that day they believe was the fir&s;t calling of the Gentils, and for that rea&s;on they return them into the bo&s;ome of the Church:</P>
<P>Our devotions at Chri&s;tmas being over, my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador made all nece&s;&s;ary pre|parations for our Voiage from <HI>Vologda</HI> to <HI>Mo&s;co.</HI> In order to which he &s;ent to <HI>Ne&s;trof</HI> to de&s;ire that he might have good &s;ledges chiefly for his Gentlemen, and that the &s;ame might attend them quite through his journey to &s;pare the trouble of changing them by the way. But this demand was pre&s;ently rejected by Ne&s;trof, who had been will plea&s;ed if all his Excellencies Retinue would have marched on foot. His an&s;wer was, he could not furni&s;h him with any, but the Ordinary &s;ledges which are commonly very thin and &s;plit in their &s;ides. Upon this an&s;wer my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador di&s;patched his Secretary to him, who told him freely it was mo&s;t undecent to have per|&s;ons of quality wor&s;e accommodated for their confidence in the Care of the <HI>Tzar</HI> &s;o great a
<PB N="106" REF="60">
Monarch, than if they had been at their own charges. He replied they might do as they plea&s;ed, no body hindered them from take|ing their own cour&s;e. And thereupon he de|clared that his Excellence had no rea&s;on, to complain, that his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty had done him extraordinary honor in &s;ending a per&s;on of his quality &s;o far to conduct him to <HI>Mo&s;co.</HI> To which the Secretary replied, that my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador acknowlegded his quality, but that he never thought it &s;o great, that he and his a&s;&s;ociate ought to pre|ferr them&s;elves before him as they had done at their fir&s;t vi&s;it. But after all this expo&s;tu|lation his Excellence was con&s;trained to pro|vide him&s;elf of &s;ledges at his own charges. In the mean time to &s;ecure them&s;elves from the wind and the &s;now, every one took care to make him&s;elf a kind of a tilt of cloth &s;tretched upon two or three hoops, as the people of quality of tho&s;e parts are u&s;ed to do. And the weather being exceeding cold, the greate&s;t part lined their &s;ledges with a cour&s;e kind of felt that is &s;old on purpo&s;e for that u&s;e, as they did likewi&s;e their Coverlets with good furs to wrap them&s;elves up in. The re&s;t provided as well as they could to cover them&s;elves, &s;o that our <HI>Sa|mojedes</HI> Ve&s;ts were not with out imployment, nor were our Buck and Sheeps &s;kin unu&s;e|full in this Voiage, everyone endeavouring

<HEAD>Of his Excellencies Journey from <HI>Vologda</HI> to <HI>Mo&s;co.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MY Lord Amba&s;&s;ador fore&s;eeing what the inconvenience would be if he marched with his whole train along with him, e&s;pecially from <HI>Vologda</HI> to <HI>Yero&s;laf,</HI> upon which road there was nothing but Villages, thought good to &s;end before his Hor&s;es and all things belonging to his Stables with &s;ixty &s;ledges, in which there was al&s;o a good part of his bagage, and &s;ome nine or ten Servants who had all their quarters a&s;&s;igned that they might have the better care of the Goods. The 7. of <HI>January</HI> 1664. they &s;et forward, and on the 15. of the &s;ame moneth his Ex|cellence with a Train of about an hundred and forty Sledges. On the 19. he arrived at <HI>Yero&s;laf,</HI> having cro&s;&s;ed the <HI>Volga</HI> at the Towns-end, which was Frozen over, and covered with Snow. The 22. we parted from <HI>Yero&s;laf</HI> all together, and pa&s;&s;ing by <HI>Ro&s;tof,</HI> we came the 24. to <HI>Pero&s;laf.</HI> The next day his Excellence departed from <HI>Pero&s;laf,</HI> and arri|ved on the 27. at <HI>Troitza,</HI> where we &s;tayed five days. At length we came to the <HI>Yawes</HI> on the third of <HI>February,</HI> which is a little
<PB N="108" REF="61">
Village &s;ome five Ver&s;ts from <HI>Mo&s;co,</HI> and there it was my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador prepared him&s;elf for his Entry, which began the fifth, and was not fini&s;hed till the &s;ixth at Night.</P>
<P>The Weather was &s;o &s;harp, and the Fro&s;t &s;o violent, when Mr. <HI>Godbolt</HI> (the Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e) departed with my Lord's Coach and Hor&s;es from <HI>Vologda,</HI> that notwith&s;tand|ing our provi&s;ion of Furs, we thought we &s;hould never have been able to overcome it. But this extremity continued not above five or &s;ix days, the Heavens had re&s;erved more mild and propitious weather for his Excellen|cies departure, &s;o that it thawed till the very day we arrived at <HI>Yero&s;laf;</HI> but it began then to rea&s;&s;ume its former fiercene&s;s, as by very &s;en&s;ible Convictions we found afterwards. We marched as well night as day, every one in his &s;ledge at his full length. And, becau&s;e the upper parts of us were more expo&s;ed to the injuries of the Aire, we took a particular care of covering our &s;elves, and to &s;top all the chinks the cold might po&s;&s;ibly come in at. We had every one of us (be&s;ides our Furs) his bottle of &s;trong water, which we drunk off now and then as an excellent pre|&s;ervative of Heat. The Kitchin went &s;till before with the <HI>Ru&s;s</HI> Harbingers, which the <HI>Pri&s;tafs</HI> &s;ent away to take up our Lodgings in good time, and to get &s;uch meat dre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="109" REF="61">
as they had along with them, and having di&s;patched the&s;e away, they advanced to the next place &s;ome three or four hours before the Amba&s;&s;ador. The <HI>Pri&s;tafs</HI> Equipage made the whole journey on hor&s;e-back; true it is they were well mounted and warm|ly clad, yet in my judgment their manner of travailing was very much di&s;agreable with the Sea&s;on. The Waggoners or Drivers con|dition was lamentable too, who as the other had no other covering than the Sky, but they had this advantage that they could warm them&s;elves as they ran by their Sledges &s;ides, be&s;ides a certain dexterity they had got in begging &s;trong Waters, which they would do &s;o frequently, it was a hard matter to prevent them by offering it. Moreover we had three Relaies or Stages by the way, <HI>viz.</HI> at <HI>Yero&s;laf,</HI> at <HI>Pero&s;laf,</HI> and at <HI>Troitza,</HI> where &s;ome of us changed both their Hor&s;es and Sledges; others whom his Excellence had furni&s;hed with Sledges from <HI>Vologda,</HI> provided them&s;elves with fre&s;h Hor&s;es only, &s;o that each of us had four &s;everal Waggoners or Drivers by the way.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t Inconvenience I found in our whole Voiage was in our Lodging; for be|&s;ides that the accommodation of Inns is not known in that Country, there are very few Towns upon the Road that are capable of receiving an Amba&s;&s;ador. So that his Excel|lence
<PB N="110" REF="62">
had never good Quarters, but at <HI>Ye|ro&s;laf,</HI> at a <HI>Mo&s;covites</HI> hou&s;e which was new|ly built, and there we &s;tayed near four compleat days to refre&s;h our &s;elves, mo&s;t of us lying in &s;heets, which we had &s;carce done any where but there in our whole Voiage. Our u&s;ual lodgings were Cabbins, or little Cottages of Wood, one &s;tory high, black all over with &s;moak, &s;o that to di&s;&s;ipate the &s;tinks which are occa&s;ioned by the &s;ame, and the &s;weltring heat of their &s;kins, which would be otherwi&s;e intollerable, we were forced to keep the Windows continually open. But the greate&s;t trouble we had in the&s;e lodgings, or <HI>Wi&s;bies</HI> (as they call them) was when they heated their Stoves, for having no Chimneys they make their fires within &s;ide of the Chambers, and the &s;moak having no pa&s;&s;age but at the Windows into the Streets, it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to &s;ub&s;i&s;t one moment in that condition.</P>
<P>And hence it was al&s;o we were &s;o ill ac|commodated with Diet: for, be&s;ides that we almo&s;t alwaies eat in a Scramble, mutton, beef, or hens, which were ro&s;ted in their furnaces, was commonly our fare. They ha|ving no other invention for the dre&s;&s;ing their meat, &amp; we doing it ordinarily in ha&s;t, it fell out often our meat was but half dre&s;&s;ed, in&s;omuch that &s;ome rather cho&s;e to eat their meat that had been frozen in the way, provi|ded
<PB N="111" REF="62">
it had been better dre&s;&s;ed. This it was that in the beginning of this Relation gave me occa&s;ion to &s;ay, that among&s;t the Uten&s;ils of the Kitchin that the Amba&s;&s;ador brought from <HI>England,</HI> a Chimney would not have been &s;uperfluous in &s;everal places. However as we were well lodged at <HI>Yero&s;laf,</HI> &s;o our entertainment was very &s;plendid, the Go|vernour of the Town &s;hewing &s;o much gene|ro&s;ity, that he would &s;pare no co&s;t in rega|ling the Amba&s;&s;ador and his Train. There was an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchant there, that treated his Excellence very nobly, <HI>Ne&s;trof</HI> enter|tained him twice al&s;o in his Voiage, and among&s;t the re&s;t at <HI>Pero&s;laf,</HI> where we had the diver&s;ion of Mu&s;ique, though in a <HI>Wi&s;by</HI> all blackned with &s;moak.</P>
<P>Furthermore, in the Condition where in we travailed, it was no ea&s;ie matter for us to divert our &s;elves being every one in his &s;ledg by him&s;elf as in another world, march|ing as well night as day amid&s;t the &s;now, and in the Violence of the winter, which to us &s;eemed very bitter, though to the <HI>Mo&s;|covites</HI> it appeared very Favourable; Our Emploiment for the mo&s;t part was &s;leeping, the &s;olitude, the warmth of our furrs, and the agreeable motion of our &s;ledges inviting us thereunto; &s;o that the greate&s;t part of us did nothing almo&s;t but &s;leep all the Voiage. And for this rea&s;on when we came near any
<PB N="112" REF="63">
Town or Village, the Amba&s;&s;ador gave order that the Trumpets &s;hould &s;ound, to give adverti&s;ement to his train.</P>
<P><HI>Mo&s;covie</HI> being not very populous, and the Towns but of wood, my intention is not to delay my &s;elf in de&s;cribing tho&s;e that pre|&s;ented them&s;elves in this Voiage. For, be&s;ides that the <HI>Mo&s;covites</HI> are very &s;crupulous in permitting &s;trangers to &s;ee their forts, there are very few of their Towns worthy an exact de&s;cription. The hand&s;ome&s;t we &s;aw in this Journey is <HI>Yero&s;laf,</HI> no very great Town but remarquable for that the <HI>Volga</HI> runs by it, and renders it a place of good Trade and populous. At <HI>Pero&s;laf</HI> there is a very narrow River, but above 100 fathoms deep, and by the &s;ide of the Town a little Lake which was frozen as well as the River, at that time. <HI>Troitza</HI> is a Town built upon the bending of a hill: in which there is a Covent that makes it very remarquable. It is built on a plain below the Town, all of &s;tone, fortified with a faire Wall, and &s;o rich that it maintains ordinarily 300 Monks. Here it was his Excellence was retarded five days in re&s;pect of the preparation that was making at <HI>Mo&s;co</HI> for his Entry, and by rea&s;on that betwixt this place and <HI>Mo&s;co,</HI> there was no other Town &s;o proper for his &s;tay, though in this al&s;o he was &s;ufficiently incom|moded;
<PB N="113" REF="63">
Yet in all the time he could not have liberty to &s;ee the Mona&s;tery:</P>
<P>On the third of <HI>February</HI> as &s;oon as we were arrived at the <HI>Yaws,</HI> his Excellence got his Coach ready, and put him&s;elf immediately into a condition of making his &s;olemne Entry into <HI>Mo&s;co.</HI> In the mean time the tediou&s;ne&s;s of our Journey pa&s;t, the ill lodging we met with in &s;o little a Village, and the happy repo&s;e we promi&s;ed our &s;elves in <HI>Mo&s;co,</HI> made us impatiently to expect tho hour of our departure. At length the fifth of that month was appointed for the Amba&s;&s;adors reception, as <HI>Ne&s;trof</HI> had acquainted his Excellence the day before, advi&s;ing him to have all things ready by nine a clock the next Morning, which according to the <HI>Mo&s;covite</HI> accompt was the third hour of the day. Accordingly the Liveries were immediately given out to tho&s;e that were to wear them, and the Gentlemen put them&s;elves with all &s;peed in|to a very good Equipage, &s;o that all were ready at the hour appointed. Our Liveries were &s;o rich, and &s;o well trim'd, that the Pages Liveries among&s;t others co&s;t near thirty pound &s;terling a piece, being almo&s;t covered quite over with &s;ilver lace. Each of them had a good plume of feathers in his hat, and in &s;hort there was nothing in all this Equipage unworthy the greatne&s;s of the Ma&s;ter. This was in part the condition in
<PB N="114" REF="64">
which his Excellence was to make his Entry on the 5. of <HI>February,</HI> for which all things were in readine&s;s by nine of the clock in the morning. But the hour being come we had no Orders for our departure, in &s;o much that there we lay langui&s;hing in a tedious ex|pectation till four a clock in the evening. His Excellence having di&s;patched his Cooks to <HI>Mo&s;co</HI> in the morning to prepare his dinner in the hou&s;e that was a&s;&s;igned him there, we were con&s;trained to remain all that day without provi&s;ions, becau&s;e we expected every moment to be gone. In the mean time no body knew what to make of this dis-order; <HI>Ne&s;trof</HI> him&s;elf was amazed and could not imagine the rea&s;on, unle&s;s it was that the <HI>Tzar</HI> was a-&s;leep, and no body dur&s;t wake him. At length about half an hour before night, the Me&s;&s;engers arrived with orders for our departure when we were in de&s;pair of making our Entry. The Amba&s;&s;ador was much &s;urpri&s;ed at it, and could not imagine what their de&s;igne &s;hould be to receive him in the night, in &s;o much, that he repre&s;ented to <HI>Ne&s;trof</HI> that it was not the Cu&s;tome to receive Amba&s;&s;adors in that Manner. However orders being come, and we tyred with an extream impatience all day of removing from tho&s;e <HI>Wi&s;bies,</HI> he prepared to depart, and expo&s;e all his pomp and &s;plendor to the darkne&s;s of the night.</P>

<HEAD>Of the &s;olemne Entry of the Am|ba&s;&s;ador into <HI>Mo&s;co.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Glory of Princes is in &s;ome propor|tion like the glory of the Sun, and &s;uffers its Eclip&s;es, the di&s;orders and irregularities of their Officers many times intercepting the rays of their glory. Of this we have an in|&s;tance in the condition we were in all that day, contrary to the <HI>Tzars</HI> de&s;igne, who &s;tayd near four houres with the Empre&s;s or great Dutche&s;&s;e at one of the gates of the Town, to &s;ee the &s;plendor of this Emba&s;&s;y which was to be more particularly illu&s;trious at this Entry. But tho&s;e who were the con|trivers of this &s;o great mi&s;carriage, were the cau&s;e al&s;o of that which happened after our &s;etting forth, and which his Excellence re|&s;ented with great indignation; which was the deferring of our Entry till the next day, after we had advanced a good part of our way, and arrived within &s;ight of the Town. For it being very late, and the night overta|king us when as of five <HI>Ver&s;ts</HI> we had pa&s;t but two, his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty thought good his Excellence &s;hould retire, and &s;end orders to <HI>Ne&s;trof</HI> to conduct him into a little Village on the Left hand, to the end the Amba&s;&s;ador might from thence make his Entry the next

morning in good time. We had already in &s;ome manner pre&s;aged this di&s;order when we took notice how we were lead thorough by ways, and that they had by de&s;igne drawn us out of the high way. For which cau&s;e the Amba&s;&s;ador reflecting upon the ill treatment he had received that day: and ima|gining this delay would become every where a matter of laughter and contempt, he was &s;o farr tran&s;ported, that he re&s;olved and pro|te&s;ted not to make his Entry till he had lawfull reparation thereupon. And to te&s;tify the re&s;entment he had of this affront, he com|manded his Trumpets &s;hould be &s;ilent. Thus this day, which &s;hould have been a day of Pomp and Magnificence proved a day of fa&s;ting of trouble and di&s;content; this day in which his Excellence ought to have re|ceived the extraordinarie Markes of the greate&s;t Amity that ever was betwixt two Crownes, was a day in which he received but the tokens of indignity and contempt. True it is, the Amba&s;&s;ador was no &s;ooner ar|rived at the <HI>&V;illage,</HI> we were retired to by order from the great <HI>Duke,</HI> but a <HI>Diack</HI> (who&s;e name was <HI>Loukian Golozof</HI>) arrived from him to excu&s;e this di&s;order, and ac|cordingly he alledged that the Me&s;&s;engers that were &s;ent with the orders for our de|parture had imprudently lo&s;t their way, and that his Maje&s;ty judging it inconvenient his
<PB N="117" REF="65">
Excellence &s;hould make his Entry &s;o late, he thought good to defer him till the next mor|ning, that he might give him a Reception &s;ui|table to his Character. But the Amba&s;&s;ador being a&s;&s;ured that this wandring of the Me&s;|&s;engers was but a pretence (for he was otherwi&s;e informed, that all this happened be|cau&s;e they were not ready to receive him) he was &s;o farr from being &s;atisfied with his apo|logy, that he was di&s;gu&s;ted at the very per&s;on of the <HI>Diack,</HI> and told him that with|out any reflexion upon him, it had been more becomming to have &s;ent a per&s;on of greater quality than he was of, to excu&s;e &s;uch pro|ceedings. In the mean time our Cooks were &s;ent back, who brought us &s;ome provi&s;ion along with them, to recover tho&s;e Spirits we had lo&s;t that day for want of victuals. The next day in the morning his Excellency ap|prehending <HI>Golozof</HI> might have either di&s;|guized or concealed his an&s;wer, he com|manded his Secretarie to draw up a letter in writing to the <HI>Tzar,</HI> in which he &s;hould in|form him of the principal circum&s;tances of this di&s;order, and intimate his re&s;olution not to &s;tirr from thence, till &s;ome correction were given to the Authors and In&s;truments of it.

<HEAD>Mo&s;t Illu&s;trious and mo&s;t Renowned Prince and Emperour,</HEAD>
<P>THis new and unaccu&s;tomed re|&s;olution of writing to your Im|perial Maje&s;tie, before I have the mo&s;t de&s;ired Honour of being admitted to Your Maje&s;ties pre&s;ence, is occa&s;ioned by a misfortune, if not an indignity which hapned to me Ye&s;terday. After a tedious Journey from <HI>Vologda,</HI> and three Days waiting at the di&s;tance only of four miles from Your Imperial Court, when I had ri&s;en very early, and according to the adverti&s;ement of
<PB N="123" REF="68">
<HI>Offonarius Evanovit&s;ius Ne&s;trof,</HI> had fitted my &s;elf for my Journey; never|thele&s;s, I was con&s;trained to langui&s;h till after Ten without any manner of refre&s;hment, in the confinement and dirt of a &s;moaky Cottage. All which things, though mo&s;t unworthy the Maje&s;tie of the King my Ma&s;ter, Your Imperial Grandeur, and my particular Character, I patiently &s;u&s;tained with the hope however of Entring Your Imperial City, and approaching the pre&s;ence of Your Imperial Maje&s;tie, and declaring my ju&s;t complaints. At length, when Night was now at hand, notice was given for our &s;etting for|wards. And after the Guides had, like <HI>Ignes fatui,</HI> mi&s;lead me up and down the Fields, in the Night, it was &s;igni|fied to me, that I mu&s;t quarter in this pitiful Village, amid&s;t all kind of in|conveniences, and &s;warms of trouble|&s;ome In&s;ects. I confe&s;s I received from Your Imperial Maje&s;tie by a certain

Vice-chancellor, a very courteous Me&s;&s;age, excu&s;ing the matter, and charging the fault upon the negligence of the Guides and Po&s;ts.

<PB N="125" REF="69">
ca&s;e any &s;uch thing &s;hould happen in his Kingdom, the King my Ma&s;ter would have &s;ent &s;ome per&s;on of the highe&s;t Nobility to excu&s;e it (which I &s;peak without reproach to the Vice-chancellor) and not de&s;i&s;ted till he had expiated &s;o barbarous and inhu|mane an action with the blood of the Criminals, of whatever quality or con&s;ideration; That this proceeding would give cau&s;e of talk and laughter to the whole World; That therefore, however de&s;irous I was of approaching of Your Imperial Maje&s;tie, and ill ac|commodated in this place; yet I &s;hould not &s;tir from it till &s;atisfaction were given me upon the Per&s;ons of tho&s;e, who as much as in them lay had vio|lated and affronted the King my Ma|&s;ter, Your Imperial Maje&s;tie, and the &s;acred Character of Amba&s;&s;adors.

<PB N="127" REF="70">
<HI>Ba&s;hmacof</HI> was gone towards the Amba&s;&s;ador to give him &s;ati&s;faction in the behalf of his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty:</P>
<P>This being pa&s;t, we departed immediately to make our Entry, in which we received indeed very evident tokens of the Gran|deur of that Prince, there being all the &s;plen|dor and glory that precious &s;tones, rich furrs, cloth of gold and &s;ilver, velvets and other rich &s;tuffs, goodly hor&s;es, and a noble E|quipage could make: be&s;ides the noi&s;e of an incredible number of Trumpets, Kettle-drums and other In&s;truments of military Mu&s;ique. &s;o that it was reported every where in the court, that the City of <HI>Mo&s;co</HI> never &s;aw the Entry of any Amba&s;&s;ador &s;o glorious as this, which was made, on &s;aturday the &s;ixth of <HI>February</HI> in a very faire day, with the &s;ame Order and Circum&s;tances that follow.</P>
<P>The Amba&s;&s;adors Trumpeters, &s;ounding their &s;ilver Trumpets as they went, marcht on hor&s;back in the Van. They were followed by the Gentlemen one after another, every one in his &s;ledge, the inferior formo&s;t, &s;o that he who&s;e place and quality was imme|diately before the other followed him imme|diatly in this proce&s;&s;ion, to the end that there|by he might have the advantage of being &s;o much nearer the per&s;on of the Amba&s;&s;ador. Each of them had his &s;ledge adorned with Bear&s;kins &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, that half of them hung
<PB N="128" REF="71">
down behind. The <HI>Pri&s;tafs</HI> dome&s;tiques followed two and two, all very well clad, and they made five ranks on hor&s;back. After them came the <HI>Pri&s;tafs,</HI> each of them in his &s;ledge. And my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador followed <HI>Ne&s;trof</HI> in his &s;ledge drawn by two white hor&s;es, which is the mo&s;t e&s;teemed colour for hor&s;es in <HI>Mo&s;covie.</HI> The Tilt or covering of his &s;ledge was of &s;carlet, who&s;e edges hanging down very low were guarded round about with crowns made of little peices of &s;ky coloured velvet edged with &s;ilver lace, and the back of his &s;ledge was dre&s;t up with the &s;kin of a white Bear. On the right &s;ide of his &s;ledge upon a plank layd cro&s;s &s;ate his chief interpreter with his head uncovered, behind there was another board layd at the bottom of the &s;ledge on which there &s;tood two Pages, the twelve footmen in the mean time marching &s;ix of a &s;ide with Parti&s;ons trim'd according to their Liveries, one behind another, and all bare. Behind his Excellence followed my Lord <HI>Vicomte Morpeth</HI> the Am|ba&s;&s;adors only Son then of about &s;eventeen years of age, who bare his Father company in all his Emba&s;&s;ies. He &s;ate in a very faire gla&s;s coach drawn by &s;ix black hor&s;es, with rich hou&s;&s;es of Scarlet very well laced and fringed with &s;ilver, which upon black &s;hew very hand&s;om, and behind his Coach he had two Pages al&s;o. After my Lord <HI>Morpeth</HI> came

my Lady Amba&s;&s;adre&s;s in her <HI>Caftnaz,</HI> covered on the out &s;ide all over with Crim&s;on velvet, with very broad laces of gold and &s;ilver, and lined within with blew dama&s;ke according to the Liveries which were red, lined with blew. On each &s;ide there were great win|dows which &s;erved as doors to go in at, be|&s;ides which, there were little windows al&s;o, which her Ladi&s;hip might looke thorow with|out being &s;een her &s;elfe: &s;he had one of her Gentle-women in the <HI>Caftnaz</HI> with her, two Pages &s;tanding upon a plank behinde, and three footmen running by. After my Ladies <HI>Caftnaz</HI> came my Lord of <HI>Morpeths</HI> &s;ledg, but without any body in it: after which there followed two <HI>Caftnazes</HI> more and &s;o in order all the re&s;t of the train and baggage; which made up about two hundred &s;ledges.</P>
<P>A while after we had left this Village, (which was about two a clock) we entred into a very faire champaigne; in which the <HI>Mo&s;|covian</HI> hor&s;e were drawne up, and had been two days there putting into Order. Among&s;t the re&s;t they had a great Number of Archers with their Quivers full of arrows; and for their Mu&s;ique there were &s;o many Trumpets, Kettle-drums, Howboys, and other &s;uch in|&s;truments of war, which they had di&s;per&s;t in parties thorow all their Troops, that for two miles we were in no want of Mu&s;ique. But they having battered our ears with one con|tinued
<PB N="130" REF="72">
aire above two hours together all the way as we marcht, the noi&s;e of tho&s;e In&s;tru|ments which at fir&s;t had delighted us with their melody, became now ob&s;treperous and trouble&s;ome. In the mean time there were a great number of <HI>Boyars,</HI> of <HI>Stolnicks,</HI> and other per&s;ons of the Court, which came to meet the Amba&s;&s;ador, richly clad in Ve&s;ts or Tuniques, of cloth of gold and &s;ilver, or velvets lined with Sables, with great caps on their heads of black Fox, made in the fa&s;hion of a Muff, which they u&s;e commonly in their Ceremonies. They were mo&s;t of them very well mounted upon good hor&s;es, with rich trappings and bridles of &s;ilver, made like chains, with the linkes very broad and thin, &s;o that whil&s;t their hor&s;es were in motion, they made a noi&s;e altogether Maje&s;tique. There were &s;everall al&s;o who had their hou&s;&s;es co|vered with pretious &s;tones, who&s;e lu&s;tre &s;eemed to adde a richer light to the light of the day; and behinde them they had their &s;ervants carrying covers for their &s;adles of Leopard &s;kins, cloth of gold, velvet, and &s;carlet. All the Gentlemen of the <HI>Tzars</HI> chamber were there ready to accompany the Amba&s;&s;ador to his very hou&s;e.</P>
<P>At length, the Ma&s;ter of the great <HI>Dukes</HI> hor&s;e came to pre&s;ent to the Amba&s;&s;ador from the <HI>Tzar</HI> a &s;ledg, &amp; another for my Lord <HI>Morpeth,</HI> with &s;everal white hor&s;es for the Gentlemen.
<PB N="131" REF="72">
A while after, came <HI>Pronchi&s;&s;of,</HI> one of the <HI>Tzars</HI> Coun&s;el, and <HI>Gregory Co&s;mevitz</HI> along with him, who were both deputed to &s;erve his Excellence as <HI>Pri&s;tafs,</HI> or Ma&s;ters of the Ceremonies during his re&s;idence in <HI>Mo&s;co.</HI> And in this occa&s;ion it was we had another ridiculous example of the pride and ru&s;ticity of the <HI>Mo&s;covites,</HI> who are &s;o quick and preci&s;e in anticipating the Prerogative of Am|ba&s;&s;adors. <HI>Pronchi&s;&s;of</HI> being arrived within &s;ome &s;mall di&s;tance of the Amba&s;&s;adors &s;ledg, gave him to under&s;tand that he was &s;ent to receive him from the grand <HI>Duke</HI> his Lord, and that he expected the Amba&s;&s;ador &s;hould fir&s;t come out of his &s;ledg. But his Excellence &s;ignified to him by his Interpreter, that his ex|pectations were very ill grounded, that he repre&s;ented the per&s;on of the King his Ma&s;ter, and that in that ca&s;e all &s;uch Kind of re&s;pect was due to him&s;elf. <HI>Pronchi&s;&s;of</HI> however con|tinued unmoveable in his &s;ledg as a Ma&s;ter of Ceremonies, and &s;ent back to the Amba&s;&s;a|dor that he al&s;o was &s;ent from the <HI>Tzar</HI> his Ma&s;ter to repre&s;ent his per&s;on: &s;o that to have &s;een him, one would have thought he had taken upon him the forme of a &s;tatue, to re|pre&s;ent the Maje&s;ty of his Prince. This an|&s;wer, how ab&s;urd &s;oever it was, cau&s;ed &s;e|veral &s;mart replies both on one &s;ide and the other: till at la&s;t the Amba&s;&s;ador to prevent any further delay in his Entrance, conde&s;cen|ded
<PB N="132" REF="73">
to this, That they &s;hould both of them come out of their &s;ledges together. But in this <HI>Pronchi&s;&s;of</HI> tooke occa&s;ion to deceive his Excellence, and fal&s;ify his word, hanging in the aire betwixt the armes of his &s;ervants, and but touching the earth with his tiptoes, whil&s;t the Amba&s;&s;ador came out freely. At their meeting, they &s;aluted one another, and <HI>Pron|chi&s;&s;of</HI> fir&s;t delivered his complement, which con&s;i&s;ted in declaring his Employment, and acquainting his Excellence, that the <HI>Tzar</HI> had &s;ent him, and his a&s;&s;ociate <HI>Gregory Cofmovitz</HI> (who was there pre&s;ent al&s;o) to take care that all things nece&s;&s;ary &s;hould be provided during his continuance at <HI>Mo&s;co.</HI> But the greate&s;t part of his complement was the reci|tation of his Ma&s;ters Titles, which he enume|rated from the fir&s;t to the la&s;t, in a mo&s;t trou|ble&s;ome and ridiculous maner, as will appeare hereafter. His complement being made, and the Amba&s;&s;ador having an&s;wered him with a very good grace, they retired both of them into their &s;ledges, <HI>Pronchi&s;&s;of</HI> returning in the &s;ame po&s;ture he came, his &s;ervants hol|ding him up by his armes, as if they were afraid he &s;hould &s;inke under the burthen of the emploiment, which his Ma&s;ter had given him. At this time <HI>Ne&s;trof</HI> and <HI>Davidof</HI> (gi|ving place to <HI>Pronchi&s;&s;of</HI> and <HI>Gregory Co&s;mo|vitz</HI> the new <HI>Pri&s;tafs</HI>) took their leaves of the Amba&s;&s;ador. After which Ceremonies, we
<PB N="133" REF="73">
di&s;po&s;ed our &s;elves to enter into the Town, the Amba&s;&s;ador having <HI>Pronchi&s;&s;of</HI> on his right hand, and <HI>Co&s;movitz</HI> on his left; my Lord <HI>Morpeth</HI> had two Lords of the Court to accompany him; &s;o that in every ranke there were three &s;ledges a brea&s;t. The Gen|tlemen were all on hor&s;eback betwixt <HI>Sin|boyars,</HI> or Gentlemen of the Court. The Chaplaine, Phy&s;itian, and Mu&s;ique-Ma&s;ter, with &s;everal Engli&s;h Merchants, and two Vallets de Chambre were joyned with them, &s;o that they made up about five and twenty ranks on hor&s;e-back, marching three a brea&s;t.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Ceremonies, and the &s;lowne&s;s of our march took up &s;o much time, that the night overtook us before we could enter the Town, our frequent &s;toppings and paw&s;es having con&s;um'd above three houres in going of about two miles. Therefore, becau&s;e the Sun had withdrawn him&s;elf before we were ready to appear in the Town, the Citizens had made great fires in their &s;treets, and pro|vided great numbers of torches to render every thing vi&s;ible about his Excellence; &s;o that the night as well as the day did &s;eem to participate in the Glory of this Entry. And the pretious &s;tones, darting about the rays of their refulgency, made the clearne&s;s of the night in &s;ome re&s;pect more maje&s;tique than the brightne&s;s of the day; not to mention the multitudes of people, wherewith the &s;treets
<PB N="134" REF="74">
were filled, and the hou&s;es covered in all places where we pa&s;&s;ed, every one clam|bring up here and there to behold this Mag|nificence.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tzar,</HI> the great Dutche&s;s, and the young Princes al&s;o would needs be Spectators now, as they had di&s;po&s;ed them&s;elves to be the day before. But to the end they might &s;ee all without being perceived them&s;elves, they made choice of a place near the Gate of the Brick Wall, whither they had ordered a great number of Wax-tapers to be &s;ent. And here the <HI>Mo&s;covian</HI> Trumpets all &s;topt, to &s;ound at the time as the Amba&s;&s;ador pa&s;t the Gate, and was entred into the Town, which was exactly performed: but with &s;o confu&s;ed a noi&s;e, it might very well be com|pared to that which the Gee&s;e made in the <HI>Capitol,</HI> whil&s;t the <HI>Gauls</HI> were climbing over the Walls. After this terrible alarm, which we were altogether &s;urpri&s;ed with, under pretence of &s;ome little accident, they made a &s;top for about half a quarter of an hour, to the end the <HI>Tzar</HI> might at his lei&s;ure ob&s;erve the whole Pomp; and indeed the great number of Wax-Tapers which they had di&s;|po&s;ed of each &s;ide of the Gate, di&s;covered the de&s;ign clear enough. At length, when his Maje&s;tie was &s;atisfied with viewing the Magnificence of his Excellences Train, he was conducted to the Hou&s;e which they had pre|pared
<PB N="135" REF="74">
for him, the <HI>Mo&s;covian</HI> hor&s;e trouping thorough the Town in a huddle, without ob&s;erving any order at all in their march. From the Gate of the Town, we pa&s;t thorow the <HI>Tzars</HI> Guards, which were drawn up on both &s;ides of the &s;treets, from thence to the Hou&s;e where we lay.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Amba&s;&s;adors Re&s;idence at <HI>Mo&s;co.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THere are three things which principally recommend them&s;elves to our Con&s;ide|ration in this place: Our manner of Living whil&s;t we were here; The Amba&s;&s;adors Negotiation; And &s;ome Circum&s;tances that happened during our Re&s;idence at <HI>Mo&s;co.</HI> Of which City it is nece&s;&s;ary to give a pre|cedent De&s;cription for the better compre|hen&s;ion of what followeth.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Mo&s;co</HI> hath the &s;ame incon|venience with the other Towns in <HI>Mo&s;covie,</HI> which is, that it is built like them with Wood, &s;ome princi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> Hou&s;es excepted. In|&s;tead of being paved, they have only great pieces of Firr laid clo&s;e together, and cro&s;s the Streets. When we were there, its figure was almo&s;t Circular, and at lea&s;t four leagues in Cirumference, but being much &s;ubject to Fire, its form and extent doth not continue long in the &s;ame condition. True it is, their
<PB N="136" REF="75">
Streets are broad enough, and from place to place there are certain Intervals left to break off and cea&s;e the fury of the Fire, but the materials of their Hou&s;es being &s;o com|bu&s;tible, they have much ado to prevent its progre&s;s. All the remedy they have, is to pull down the Hou&s;es that are next, to the end that by taking away the matter, that &s;hould nouri&s;h it, they may give the flame more room to extingui&s;h. But this not al|waies &s;ucceeding, e&s;pecially if the wind be high, it happens &s;ometimes, that they &s;ee a great part of the Town in a&s;hes in a very &s;hort &s;pace.</P>
<P>This Town hath three Walls, one of Brick, another of Stone, a third of Wood, &s;epara|ting the four quarters of the Town, which are called <HI>Cataigorod, Tzargorod, Scoradom,</HI> and <HI>Strelitza Sloboda.</HI> The Brick-wall di|vides <HI>Cataigorod</HI> from the re&s;t of the Town, that of Stone belongs to <HI>Tzargorod,</HI> and the Wooden one &s;erves as Ramparts and Ba&s;tions to <HI>Strelitza Sloboda,</HI> which is properly the quarter of the <HI>Strelitz,</HI> or Mu&s;queteers of the <HI>Tzars</HI> Guards.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the Rivers that pa&s;s by this City, <HI>Mo&s;ca</HI> is a fair one, which gives it its Name; it ri&s;es in the Province of <HI>Twere,</HI> and lo&s;eth it &s;elf in the <HI>Volga,</HI> where the &s;ame joines with the River <HI>Occa,</HI> not far from <HI>Columna.</HI> Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are the <HI>Neglina</HI> and the
<PB N="137" REF="75">
<HI>Yagu&s;a,</HI> two little Rivers which run by the City, and fall into the River <HI>Mo&s;ca.</HI></P>
<P>But that which is the greate&s;t Ornament to this City, be&s;ides the Rivers I have named, is the great number of Churches and Chap|pels which they have there, together with the <HI>Tzars</HI> Ca&s;tle, which is called <HI>Cremelena.</HI> Their Churches are generally of &s;tone, arched, &amp; of a round form. They are a great Ornament to the Town, by rea&s;on of their &s;teeples, which are covered over with Lattin, who&s;e glittring &s;eemes to redouble the brightne&s;s of the Sun. As to the number of Churches &amp; Chappels in <HI>Mo&s;co,</HI> they are reckoned about two thou&s;and.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tzars</HI> Ca&s;tle is of that greatne&s;s, that it is about two miles in Circumference. There is in it a very fair Pallace of Stone, built after the <HI>Italian</HI> fa&s;hion, and another of Wood, which the <HI>Tzar</HI> chu&s;es to re&s;ide in, as the more healthful of the two. The Patriarch al&s;o, and &s;everal Boyars have their Hou&s;es of Stone within this Ca&s;tle, be&s;ides two Covents, one of Moncks, and the other of Nuns. There are al&s;o a great number of Churches and Chappels of Stone, and among&s;t the re&s;t, one dedicated to St. <HI>Michael,</HI> in which the Tombs of the <HI>Tzars</HI> are placed. All the Steeples of the&s;e Churches are covered with Copper, which the heat of the Sun hath burni&s;hed into a great re&s;emblance of Gold; but upon one of the&s;e Steeples there &s;tands
<PB N="138" REF="76">
a Cro&s;s which is of ma&s;&s;ie Gold. We &s;aw there a Bell (which was made &s;ome years &s;ince by a <HI>Mo&s;covite</HI>) of that prodigious big|ne&s;s, that fifty men might very well &s;tand within it. It is about nine fathoms in cir|cumference, which by con&s;equence is three in diameter. When we came fir&s;t to <HI>Mo&s;co,</HI> it was upon the ground, in a ba&s;e Court where it was ca&s;t, and during the four moneths and a half we remained there, all they could do, was to rai&s;e it though but a little from the ground, with intention to build a Stee|ple for it in the &s;ame place. The Fortifi|cations of the Ca&s;tle are al&s;o very con&s;i|derable: for, be&s;ides that it is very well planted with Canon, there is a large Ditch and three very &s;trong Walls about it. Some of our company that had the curio&s;ity to &s;urvey this Ditch, as they pa&s;t over the bridg, were de&s;ired by the <HI>Mo&s;covites</HI> to march on, and not trouble them&s;elves with &s;urveying their Works.</P>
<P>There are moreover in <HI>Mo&s;co</HI> a great number of <HI>Greeks,</HI> of <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> and e&s;peci|ally of <HI>Tartars,</HI> but they admit no <HI>Jews.</HI> The <HI>Greeks</HI> of all Strangers are mo&s;t well|come to them, as being in many things conformable with them, but particularly in matters of Religion. The <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> and <HI>Lutherans</HI> are well received al&s;o, and have all of them liberty to hold publique A&s;&s;em|blies,
<PB N="139" REF="76">
for the Exerci&s;e of their Religion, which is not permitted to the <HI>Roman</HI> Ca|tholicks, for whom they have a particular aver&s;ion. But to the end that forreign Chri|&s;tians may live together with more liberty, there is a <HI>Sloboda,</HI> or great Suburb without the Town, where mo&s;t of them live, accor|ding to their own way. And in this place it is the <HI>Germans, Engli&s;h, Hollanders,</HI> and <HI>Po|lonians</HI> do mo&s;t commonly re&s;ide.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e we were lodged in in this Town, was a large building of Stone, no great di&s;tance from the Ca&s;tle, and one of the mo&s;t commodious to be found. The Chambers were all arched, every window had its &s;hutters of iron, and every pa&s;&s;age-door was al&s;o of iron: which gave one occa&s;ion to &s;ay, we were certainly in the iron Age; though otherwi&s;e it be a mettle rare enough in that Country. Our Chambers were mo&s;t of them hanged with Serge or red Cloth, and in&s;tead of chairs, we had benches cover|ed over with the &s;ame &s;tuff, without any Beds or other nece&s;&s;ary accommodations, be&s;ides tables and furnaces for the Winter. Among&s;t the re&s;t of the Rooms, there were two great Hals, one of them (in which the Canopie of State was &s;et up) we made u&s;e of as our Chappel, on tho&s;e days wherein we had Sermons, of the other for a Quarter for &s;even or eight of our Gentlemen, who
<PB N="140" REF="77">
were con&s;trained at their arrival, to make their &s;everal lodgings di&s;tinct from one ano|ther. For when he who had the charge of preparing the Hou&s;e was adverti&s;ed that the Amba&s;&s;ador's Gentlemen could not lye crowded together as in a Ho&s;pital, and that this manner of living would be very &s;trange and incommodious to them; he an&s;wered je&s;tingly, that it was be&s;t for them to lye together, le&s;t the Rats &s;hould run away with them being &s;ingle. Which An&s;wer put &s;ome of us on a &s;udden upon a de&s;ire to know, if the Rats were &s;o big at <HI>Mo&s;co;</HI> for my part I imagined for the doing of &s;uch an exploit, every Rat ought to be as big as two <HI>Boyars.</HI> However, we &s;aw we had great rea|&s;on to be impatient at <HI>Vologda,</HI> for our arrival here, where we had all that could be expected in this Country. Our Publique devotion which had been &s;u&s;pended in our Travails, was regulated here as at <HI>Vologda,</HI> and at Ea&s;ter we had a Communion. We had moreover the diver&s;ion of &s;eeing the Town, and to vi&s;it our Friends in the <HI>Slo|boda,</HI> where his Excellence him&s;elf was &s;ome|time treated by the Merchants. But this freedom was &s;o regulated and re&s;trained, that for the four fir&s;t days we were &s;hut up clo&s;e in our Hou&s;e, and not permitted to &s;tir abroad before the Audience. They would &s;uffer no Strangers to come near us,
<PB N="141" REF="77">
nor could the Amba&s;&s;ador prevail, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants Wives might have acce&s;s to his Lady. It is true, after the Amba&s;&s;ador's Audience we had liberty to go abroad, but then for two or three moneths we were obli|ged to take &s;ome of the <HI>Tzar's</HI> Guards along with us, which followed us armed with their half-pikes; for which end there were commonly fifty of them attending us, keeping their guards at the Gate, and examining almo&s;t every one that came in. The Am|ba&s;&s;ador him&s;elf was not permitted to &s;tir unle&s;s he had a <HI>Pri&s;taf</HI> with him, and was attended with a Company of <HI>Strelits.</HI> Where|by it happened, that the Amba&s;&s;ador one day after a long expectation of the <HI>Pri&s;taf</HI> (who &s;eemed to neglect him) being upon the point of going abroad in his Coach without him, the footmen running before as if they would have pa&s;&s;ed out of the Gate, the <HI>Strelits</HI> &s;tood immediately to their armes, to hinder them, which they did, till the <HI>Pri&s;taf</HI> was plea&s;ed to come and accompany the Amba&s;&s;ador. None of the <HI>Boyars</HI> could have the &s;ight of his Excellence in his Hou&s;e, un|le&s;s he was &s;ent by the <HI>Tzar,</HI> it being almo&s;t a Capital offence for any per&s;on of quality what&s;oever, to have any kind of Conference with an Amba&s;&s;ador without his leave. Hunting, which was our great diverti&s;ement at <HI>Vologda,</HI> was the lea&s;t of our recreations
<PB N="142" REF="78">
here, but a&s;&s;oon as the &s;now was melted, and the &s;pring arrived, we fell immediately to making of Hor&s;e-matches. There was a challenge al&s;o betwixt twelve of our Company to play at Foot-ball. At other times we ran at the Ring, and on that day our repa&s;t was taken in the Wood, where that exerci&s;e was performed. Our Mu&s;ique-ma&s;ter compo&s;ed a hand&s;ome Comedie in Pro&s;e, which was acted in our Hou&s;e. As for their Baths, they were as rare at <HI>Mo&s;co</HI> as hunting, for we u&s;ed one as often there as the other. But the mo&s;t part of our Family would go now and then to their publique Stoves, where &s;ometimes they could &s;ee a great company of Women naked by the favour of &s;ome little hole or cleft in the Wall, which &s;erved al&s;o as a pa&s;&s;age for their immode&s;t di&s;cour&s;es. About one mile from <HI>Mo&s;co</HI> we ob&s;erved in a little Lake an Iland floting, as the Antients belie|ved of <HI>Delos,</HI> but it was very &s;mall. It is kept above water by the roots of Trees, with which it is enterlaced, there were &s;ome of us took a boat and went upon it, turning it as a piece of timber which way they plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>This being, as near as I could relate, the manner of our living at <HI>Mo&s;co,</HI> it follows now that we di&s;play the Amba&s;&s;adors negotiation,
<PB N="143" REF="78">
and at the &s;ame time the Ceremonies which are practi&s;ed in that Court. In pur&s;uance of which de&s;ign, I &s;hall &s;peak in the fir&s;t place of the Audience which the <HI>Tzar</HI> gave the Am|ba&s;&s;ador on the 11. of <HI>February,</HI> which was five days after our Entry.</P>
<P>The 7. of <HI>February</HI> which was the next day after we arrived at <HI>Mo&s;co, Pronchi&s;&s;of,</HI> and the other <HI>Pri&s;taf</HI> offered the Amba&s;&s;ador Au|dience from the great <HI>Duke</HI> on the ninth of that month, and pretented it as a &s;ingular favour, that he could have it &s;o &s;oon; never|thele&s;s, the next day they thought fit to delay him two days longer. In which time his Ex|cellence was de&s;irous to informe him&s;elf of all the Ceremonies which were to be ob&s;er|ved, according to the Cu&s;tome of that Court: and among&s;t other things, he demanded of them, whether it were expected that he &s;hould be uncovered in the pre&s;ence of the <HI>Tzar.</HI> To which they an&s;wer'd, that the <HI>Tzar's</HI> Amba&s;&s;adors were bare before the King of <HI>England,</HI> and by con&s;equence that he was to be &s;o before his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Ma^t^y^.. But the Amba&s;|&s;ador declared freely to them, that his Ma&s;ter the King of <HI>England</HI> had commanded him to be &s;o, and for that rea&s;on he was obliged not to di&s;pute it: otherwi&s;e the Amba&s;&s;adors of the <HI>Tzar</HI> could not &s;o well repre&s;ent the per&s;on of their Prince, being but his Slaves, and &s;o
<PB N="144" REF="79">
&s;tiled by him in their very Letters of Credence. After this, he demanded leave to vi&s;it the great Dutche&s;s and the young Princes, the elde&s;t of which was not above ten years old; but this was refu&s;ed upon this ground, that it was not their cu&s;tome. Indeed the <HI>Tzars</HI> wives live there very retyred, and his Sons appear not in publique, till they are twelve years old, at which age they &s;how them &s;o|lemnely to the People, and the <HI>Tzar</HI> him&s;elf is but rarely to be &s;een.</P>
<P>The Eleaventh day being come, there were a hundred and thirty per&s;ons of the <HI>Tzars</HI> Guards, and three&s;core &s;ledges &s;ent to carry the Pre&s;ents from the King, the greate&s;t part of which was de&s;igned for the <HI>Tzar,</HI> the re&s;t for the two young Princes <HI>Knetz, Alexcy, Alexevitz,</HI> and <HI>Pheodor Alexevitz</HI> his Sons. But be&s;ides the Kings Pre&s;ents to the great <HI>Duke,</HI> there were Pre&s;ents al&s;o from the Queen to the great <HI>Dutche&s;s,</HI> and &s;ome which his Excellence gave the great <HI>Duke</HI> apart as from him&s;elf. The whole con&s;i&s;ted in Ve&s;&s;els of gold and &s;ilver, in cloth, velvets, &s;atins, and dama&s;ke of divers colours; there was al&s;o great quantities of &s;tufs, and table linnen, two gold-watches, three clocks, two pair of Pi&s;tols, one gun, and two carabins, be&s;ides &s;ix pieces of ca&s;t Canon, a great quantity of <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> tynne, and a hundred piggs of lead. All which was &s;ent before to the pallace,
<PB N="145" REF="79">
the plate being carried by four and twenty men, the cloth by three&s;core, ten men carried the Velvets Sattins and Dama&s;k, &s;ix and twenty the &s;tufs and table linning, and ten more the Gun, the Pi&s;tols, the Watches, and the Clocks; and on the &s;ledges they carried the Canon, the Tynne, and the Lead. This being done there were two &s;ledges brought for the Amba&s;&s;ador and my Lord <HI>Morpeth,</HI> and at the &s;ame time &s;everal white hor&s;es for the Gentlemen of his attendance. At length we began to &s;ett out about ten a Clock in the morning, the Gentlemen on hor&s;back two and two all richly habited, their hats covered with fair plumes of feathers which did prin|cipally attract the eys of the <HI>Mo&s;covits,</HI> with whom the &s;treets, the &s;hops, the gates and the windows did &s;warme at this time. There were &s;everal <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants al&s;o who had joyned them&s;elves with the Gentlemen, and were fallen into the &s;ame Order. After them followed my Lord <HI>Morpeth</HI> in his &s;ledg be|twixt the Amba&s;&s;adors <HI>Pri&s;tafs</HI> who had brought their rich robes along with them to our hou&s;e, and put them on there. After my Lord <HI>Morpeth</HI> the two Trumpets followed, after them the &s;ix Pages in three ranks, and after them the twelve footmen marching in the &s;ame Order as at our Entry. His Excel|lence was this day in black having on his ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a rich band of Diamonds, on either hand he
<PB N="146" REF="80">
had two of the principal <HI>Boyars</HI> in their &s;ledges as him&s;elf was, who had put on their robes al&s;o at our hou&s;e. In the Amba&s;&s;adors &s;ledg there was the Secretary and the chief Interpreter &s;tanding and uncovered, the Se|cretarie carrying in his hands upon a yard of red Dama&s;ke his Letters of Credence written in parchment, who&s;e Super&s;cription con|tained all the titles of the <HI>Tzar</HI> in letters of Gold. Behind the Amba&s;&s;ador there came none but the Ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e on hor&s;e|back.</P>
<P>In this manner we pa&s;t thorow the <HI>Tzars</HI> Guards, who were drawn up in rancks on both &s;ides of us reaching to the very bottom of the &s;taires of the Hall, thorow which we were to pa&s;s to audience. Near the Ca&s;tlegate we found another regiment of Guards drawn up al&s;o in very good order. A while after we pa&s;t thorow another Regiment in one of the Courts of the Ca&s;tle, and in this place we &s;aw a great number of very fair Canon planted on one &s;ide and the other with the Canoniers by them, and ready in appearance to fire upon us from all parts. From thence we pa&s;&s;ed to ano|ther Court filled al&s;o with Guards, but when we came to the gate of a pa&s;&s;age thorow which we were to go, all that were in &s;laddes or on hor&s;eback alighted. Tho&s;e who were to go up into the Hall of audience were con&s;traind to leave their &s;words behind them, it being not
<PB N="147" REF="80">
permitted for any body to pa&s;s any further with them by their &s;ides, for the prevention of which ceremony, his Excellence and my Lord <HI>Morpeth</HI> carried none with them. When we had gone &s;ome paces this way (which is a way peculiar to Chri&s;tian Amba&s;&s;adors, tho&s;e of Infidel Princes being carried another) there was a <HI>Boyar</HI> came to meet the Amba&s;&s;a|dor &amp; complemented him from the great <HI>Duke.</HI> From thence we came to a great &s;tone Galerie, where another <HI>Boyar</HI> received his Excellence with another complement. And from thence we came into a Hall thorow which we were to pa&s;s in to that of the audience, and here it was we &s;aw the Guards of the <HI>Tzars</HI> body in a mo&s;t &s;plended Equipage, their Ve&s;ts of velvet being lined with &s;ables, their caps richly adorned with pearles and precious &s;tones, and their very Parte&s;ans covered with gold and &s;ilver. Neare the door of the Hall of audience, the Amba&s;&s;ador received a third Complement from the <HI>Tzars</HI> own Cou&s;in. After which we opened to the right and left, and the Amba&s;&s;ador entred fir&s;t into the Hall, after him my Lord <HI>Morpeth,</HI> and then the Gentlemen and the Pages.</P>
<P>And here it was we were like tho&s;e who coming &s;uddainly out of the dark are dazled with the brightnes of the Sun: the &s;plendor of their jewels &s;eeming to contend for prio|rity with that of the day; &s;o that we were lo&s;t
<PB N="148" REF="81">
as it were in this confu&s;ion of glory.

His Throne was of ma&s;&s;y Silver gilt, wrought curiou&s;ly on the top with &s;everal works and Pyra|mids; and being &s;even or eight &s;teps higher than the floor, it rendered the per&s;on of this Prince tran&s;cendently Maje&s;tick. His Crown (which he wore upon a Cap lined with black Sables) was covered quite over with precious &s;tones, it terminated towards the top in the form of a Pyramid with a golden cro&s;s at the &s;pire. The Scepter gli&s;tered al&s;o all over with Jewels, his ve&s;t was &s;ett with the like from the top to the bottom down the opening before, and his collar was an&s;werable to the &s;ame. By his &s;ide he had four of the talle&s;t of his Lords &s;tanding below his Throne, each of them with his battle-ax upon his &s;houlder, and with a profound gravity ca&s;ting their Eys now and then upon their <HI>Tzar,</HI> as inviting us to an admiration of his grandeur. Their habits were no le&s;s remarquable than their countenances, being all four of them from the top of their head to the &s;ole of their foot clothed in white ve&s;ts of Ermine, and ha|ving great chaines of Gold, and their Caps of that large &s;ort which they u&s;e in their

But that which was farther admirable was the glorious equippage of the <HI>Boyars</HI> pre&s;ent at this audience, who were as &s;o many beams of the Sun elevated in his triumphal Carr, and &s;eemed to have no lu&s;tre but to do homage withal to their great Monarch. They were about two hundred cloathed all with ve&s;ts of cloth of gold, cloth of &s;ilver or velvet &s;et with Jewels, all placed in order upon benches covered with tapi&s;try round about by the wall; the floor being rai&s;ed there three or four &s;teps higher and about the bredth of a good walke. At the Entrance into the Hall there was a great number al&s;o of his <HI>Go&s;es</HI> which are his Mer|chants or Factors whom he furni&s;hes with rich robes to appear at &s;uch Ceremonies; This was the Splendour we found this great Prince in, with a countenance perfectly ma|je&s;tick; as having not only the advantage of a hand&s;ome proportion, but of a lively and vigorous age, for this was but his four and thirtieth year. The Hall notwith&s;tanding an&s;wered not very well to this Magnificence, &s;aving in its Va&s;tnes, and that it was covered all the floor over with tapi&s;try.

<HEAD>Mo&s;t Excellent and mo&s;t renowned Prince and Emperour.</HEAD>
<P>HIs mo&s;t &s;erene Maje&s;ty, my mo&s;t gracious Lord and Ma&s;ter, hath lately received from Your Imperial Ma|je&s;ty a mo&s;t honourable Emba&s;&s;age, the &s;plendour of which as it was mo&s;t worthy the magnificence of &s;o great a Monarch from whom it proceeded, &s;o the &s;ubject was mo&s;t acceptable to Him to whom it was directed. For as much as it contained, together with the mo&s;t welcome news of the health and pro|&s;perity of Your Imperial Maje&s;ty, Your joy for His happy Re&s;tauration to His Kingdoms, your memory of the ancient friend&s;hip betwixt the glorious Predece&s;&s;ors of both your Maje&s;ties and your own mo&s;t con&s;tant re&s;olution to continue and increa&s;e the &s;ame for the future. So that the ine&s;timable worth of your Imperial affection being ex|pre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="165" REF="91">
and &s;ett of by the honour of &s;o con&s;picuous an Emba&s;&s;ie, &s;eemed as a Jewel to who&s;e value nothing could be added by Nature and Art, hath appro|priated its utmo&s;t perfection. Or ra|ther what the wi&s;e&s;t of Princes &s;aid concerning a word fitly &s;poken, your &s;ea&s;onable Imperial Me&s;&s;age was like apples of gold in pictures of &s;ilver. One thing onely his mo&s;t Serene Ma|je&s;tie complaines of, and not without rea&s;on, that your Imperial Maje&s;tie hath thereby prevented Him, and whereas he had nothing earlyer in his royal intentions than to have &s;aluted you with that &s;olemnitie which be|longs to the greatne&s;s of both your E|&s;tates and Friend&s;hip, that he mu&s;t now be the la&s;t to perform it. Yet doubt|le&s;&s;e, con&s;idering the parity of your years, the conformity of your In|tere&s;ts, and con&s;equently the &s;ym|parthy of both your Inclinations, there was herein neither fir&s;t nor la&s;t be|twixt
<PB N="166" REF="92">
you, but in one in&s;tant the like cau&s;es mu&s;t in your Princely brea&s;ts have produced the &s;ame re&s;olutions. But even the influence of the caele&s;tial luminaries, tho&s;e true&s;t Emblemes of Maje&s;ty, is &s;u&s;pended by the various di&s;po&s;ition of inferiour bodies and friends, of whom your Maje&s;ties are the be&s;t pattern, although they think the &s;ame things could never yet invent &s;o punctual an happine&s;s, as to inter|change tho&s;e thoughts at one and the &s;ame minute. Seing therefore the pre|vention mu&s;t fall on one &s;ide, his mo&s;t Serene Maje&s;tie is content that your Imperial Maje&s;tie hath gained the ad|vantage of time upon Him, &s;o that he may not come behind you as he never will in the truth and &s;incerity of his affections. And therefore as is u&s;ual among Friends, he hath thought fit to render you a rea&s;on of his actions, and to alledge his mo&s;t ju&s;t excu&s;es, that nothing but the multiplicity of his
<PB N="167" REF="92">
Royal dome&s;tick affaires could have &s;o long retarded the honour he receives and paies in &s;ending to you: That in or|der to this Emba&s;&s;age to your Imperial Maje&s;ty he hath po&s;tponed the return to other Princes nearer to Him, though none have a &s;ituation clo&s;er to his heart than your &s;elfe, and that he hath been &s;o farr from admitting any delay herein, that he hath only watched the mo&s;t proper opportunity to acquit him&s;elf of &s;o due an Obligation. For though his mo&s;t Serene Maje&s;ty con&s;ults not the &s;tarrs and the po&s;ition of the hea|vens as oft as he would undertake any great action; yet he a&s;ks coun&s;el of him that is the Creator of them and the fir&s;t mover of his felicity. And therefore finding him&s;elf now &s;tated by his Al|mighty Grace and Providence in full fruition of all the ble&s;&s;ings that can crown a Sovereign head, he hath cho&s;en this as the mo&s;t fortunate hour to &s;a|lute &s;o great an Emperour, Friend and
<PB N="168" REF="93">
Brother, and to congratulate and augu|rate to your Imperial Maje&s;ty a perpe|tuity of the &s;ame, or, if it may be, great|er happine&s;s. For if Victory over Ene|mies, obedience of Subjects, and mul|titude of Friends be, as doubtle&s;s they are, the greate&s;t &s;trength and orna|ments of the Regal Throne, certainly his mo&s;t &s;erene Maje&s;ty having been a miracle of courage and aequanimity in his adver&s;s fortune is at this day a great|er miracle of pro&s;perity. For as for Enemies none hath provoked or tried his power, but tho&s;e infamous Pirates of Algier, Enemies of Chri&s;tianity and mankind, whom therefore at two thou&s;and miles di&s;tance he blocked up in their own dens, de&s;troyed their &s;hips, battered their forts, re&s;cued the captives, and forced tho&s;e mis|creants to his own conditions. For his &s;ubjects, they have gladly a&s;&s;i&s;ted to the puni&s;hment of tho&s;e Traytors and Tyrants, which &s;o long oppre&s;&s;ed and
<PB N="169" REF="93">
mi&s;led them, and with &s;o much more veneration and duty do pay their ho|mage unto their natural mo&s;t Gracious Sovereign, and have with their ancient loyalty wa&s;hed out the &s;taines of the late Rebellion. And for Friends as he hath no Chri&s;tian Prince at enmity with him, &s;o is there &s;carce any of them but have addre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to him by extraordinary Emba&s;&s;ages, and have upon their de&s;ires been received into his nearer Alliance, Covenanting fir&s;t to deliver up (as they have done) tho&s;e dete&s;table fugitives who were imbrued in the blood of his mo&s;t glo|rious Father. And if after all the&s;e things there were lei&s;ure to di&s;cour&s;e of the largene&s;s of his Dominions, he hath to his Hereditarie Kingdoms in Europe, Him&s;elf added &s;everal Provin|ces in A&s;ia, Africa, and America, be|yond whatever was acquired by his immortal Ance&s;tors. The Sea is his Bridge betwixt &s;o di&s;tant Territories,
<PB N="170" REF="94">
and as oft as he plea&s;es, his Navies do carry a moveable Frontire to all the ha|bitable World: &s;o that the Fame of his former afflictions hath not been heard &s;o farr as his pre&s;ent Dominions extend. But though the Extent of Empire be con&s;onant to the greatne&s;s of his mind, the Government of &s;ubjects natural to his Prudence and Ju&s;tice, and Victory over Enemies mu&s;t needs be gu&s;table to the height of his Courage, yet he, a Prince &s;o well exerci&s;ed in the vici&s;&s;i|tude of humane affaires, could even di&s;|reli&s;h Victory, becau&s;e it ta&s;ts of blood, and relax his Government rather than it &s;hould oppre&s;s the liberty of man|kind, and looks upon what&s;oever Ex|tent of Dominion, but as a confinement of tho&s;e more capacious thoughts wherewith he adores the Author of all the&s;e mercies. Nor values he him&s;elf therofore &s;o much upon all the&s;e things though in them&s;elves excellent and de|&s;irable, not upon the largene&s;s of his
<PB N="171" REF="94">
Territories, nor the tranquillity of his Kingdoms, nor the fortunatene&s;s of his Armes, in compari&s;on of the con|&s;tancy of his Friends. He hath him|&s;elf been fa&s;hioned to it by experience, and is by nature all made up of friend|&s;hip. Nor &s;hould I have made this de|fective rehear&s;al of things &s;o univer&s;ally known, did not the commemoration of his pre&s;ent Greatne&s;s &s;hew him to be the more con&s;iderable Friend, and im|ply the gratitude he profe&s;&s;es to tho&s;e his Friends who formerly made his ad|ver&s;ity more tolerable, and do now give the true&s;t &s;ea&s;on and &s;weetne&s;s to his better fortune. And among all tho&s;e Friends, who can be preferred, or who indeed is comparable to your Im|perial Maje&s;ty? For whether his mo&s;t Serene Maje&s;ty con&s;ider the Greatne&s;s of the Prince, the ancientne&s;s of Al|liance, or fre&s;hne&s;s of Obligations, what Tree is there that &s;preads a deeper root, or &s;heds a greener &s;hade, or beares a
<PB N="172" REF="95">
fruit more delicious? His mo&s;t Serene Maje&s;ty him&s;elf u&s;eth with much de|light to di&s;cour&s;e among us who have the honour to be neare&s;t his Sacred Per&s;on, how above an hundred year<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ago one of his Royal Ance&s;tors, Edward the fixth, did out of an heroical mind man out his &s;hips to trace out the li|mits of the World, and joyn the mo&s;t di&s;tant and unknown Nations by inter|cour&s;e. The&s;e were they that fir&s;t di&s;|covered the va&s;tne&s;s of the Northern Ocean counted till then unnavigable, who, as the Children of I&s;rael with a pillar of fire by night, &s;o were con|ducted by a pillar of continual day through that wilderne&s;s of waters unto this your Empire. They may ju&s;tly be &s;aid to have invented the true u&s;e of the load &s;tone, and that &s;upernatural needle then fir&s;t re&s;ted, at the finding out of your northern principalities, to which it had pointed in vain for &s;o many ages. Having e&s;caped the ha|zards
<PB N="173" REF="95">
of the &s;ea, they were yet in danger twice to be lo&s;t, fir&s;t in the remaining journy through &s;o &s;pacious Domi|nions, and then in the brightne&s;s of that Maje&s;ty which they expected not out of their own Country. But they were not only refre&s;hed, as it was &s;ea|&s;onable, by the courte&s;y of the then Emperour, but received moreover from his munificency, and as a reward of the trade then fir&s;t opened and in|troduced on that &s;ide of your World, tho&s;e Immunities and priviledges from which thence forward both the Nations have reaped no &s;mall Advantage. And ever &s;ince a mo&s;t &s;incere and hereditary Amity hath been tran&s;mitted between the Succe&s;&s;ors of both Princes from Fa|ther to Son, unto your Maje&s;ties now reigning. 'Twas much about that time that other Princes had &s;ent out their Navies likewi&s;e for new di&s;coveries. The <HI>Portuguez</HI> found out and conque|red in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> the Land of
<PB N="174" REF="96">
pearls and &s;pices, though none &s;o orient or fragrant as what his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty of <HI>Portugal</HI> hath depo&s;ited by the &s;ide of my mo&s;t Serene Lord and Ma&s;ter. The <HI>Spaniard</HI> in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> &s;eized upon the mines of Gold and Silver. So that when nothing of value &s;eemed left for the Kings of <HI>England,</HI> they found what was more adequate to the de&s;ires of Princes who neither needed nor co|veted further Empire, a Friend. And his mo&s;t Serene Maje&s;ty is wont to &s;ay that his was the be&s;t lot of the three, and that he would not change his Friend of an hundred years for the Trea&s;ure of both the <HI>Indies.</HI> And He adds for rea&s;on his own Experiment, fora&s;much as when his Subjects were generally revolted. His Friends as it is u&s;ual mo&s;t of them failed, and when it &s;eemed that Heaven and Earth had con|&s;pired his ruine while they were but contriving his happine&s;s, He was then not only readily a&s;&s;i&s;ted by your Impe|rial
<PB N="175" REF="96">
Maje&s;ty but the addre&s;&s;es of the U&s;urpers rejected, and your protection withdrawn from all who might &s;eem any way tainted with the infection of that di&s;loyaltie. And therefore his mo&s;t Serene Maje&s;ty, as he hath readily re|payed into the hands of your Impe|rial Amba&s;&s;ador tho&s;e &s;ums with which you did then plea&s;ure him, &s;o will he always retain depo&s;ited in the mo&s;t &s;acred rece&s;s of his Royal heart, and tran&s;mit to his Succe&s;&s;ors the me|mory of all the&s;e Obligations. And for all the&s;e new cau&s;es, and upon tho&s;e good and auncient grounds, his mo&s;t Serene Maje&s;ty declares in your own Imperial words, than which none could be either more &s;ignificant in them|&s;elves or more con&s;onant to his &s;en&s;e, <HI>That his mo&s;t Serene Maje&s;ty taking into con&s;ideration the flouri&s;hing e&s;tate of his Kingdomes, &amp; that intire brotherly love and amity and frequent corre&s;pondency which was inviolable held, and continued

Nor do I doubt but that my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador had rather accepted of &s;uch a condition as they put to Infidels Amba&s;&s;adors who are not admitted to the performance of this Cere|monie, becau&s;e the <HI>Tzar</HI> counts it a great favour, and therefore He does re&s;erve it only for Chri&s;tians.

where he had been of late his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ties Agent.

We went in the &s;ame order and manner as we did the fir&s;t time, but my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador was led into another hall much hand&s;omer than the fir&s;t, the inner-roof being fairely guilt with very good pi|ctures, there were al&s;o fair windows and very rich tape&s;trie. The <HI>Tzar</HI> was upon a little Throne not above two &s;teps over the ground, yet having &s;till the Crown upon his head and the Scepter in his hand, and at his right hand there was the Imperial <HI>Globe.</HI> This Audience being a little private, and therefore not &s;o copious of <HI>Boyars,</HI> the <HI>Tzar</HI> inquired of the Amba&s;&s;adors health, and told him be&s;ides, that having cau&s;ed the Kings Letter to be tran&s;lated he knew thereby his Maje&s;ties de|&s;ire, and that con&s;equently he had appointed &s;ix Commi&s;&s;ioners among&s;t his near <HI>Boyars</HI> and <HI>Coun&s;ellors</HI> to treat with him about his af|faires.

In that an&s;wer all things were quite contrary to his expectations, &s;o that he thought fit thereupon to &s;peak &s;omewhat hard to them. Then it happened that one great ca&s;ement of the room, wherein they were a&s;&s;embled together, fell down with &s;uch a horrid noi&s;e, that the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners were quite a&s;toni&s;hed, and wi&s;hed my Lord had &s;poken more gently.

And therefore, becau&s;e &s;o many Strangers of &s;everal Nations, which dwell in his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> City, were wine&s;&s;es that day of &s;uch mi&s;carriage, contrary to the good plea|&s;ure of his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;tie, as no age nor no Nation can paralel, and that they have, and do, and will di&s;cour&s;e of it according to their own apprehen&s;ions, both here and in their &s;everal Countries, neither to the advan|tage of the King my Ma&s;ter, nor yet of his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;tie, unle&s;s His prudence may appear in his Ju&s;tice. Therefore I &s;ay, I de|manded what is in my fir&s;t paper mentioned. But in&s;tead thereof I am told in this paper delivered to me the 26. of <HI>February,</HI> that the next day after, many Me&s;&s;engers being &s;ent unto me, I al&s;o &s;tayed late; To which I reply, that it is very po&s;&s;ible that many Me&s;&s;engers were &s;ent to me that day, and that they lo&s;t their way then as the others the day before:

And indeed in the place where I was it was yet difficulter to finde me, e&s;pecially &s;eeing it appeares the nearer one comes to <HI>Mo&s;co</HI> men are more ignorant of the Roads.

before the mo&s;t Illu&s;trious day that had detained me from Him. But whereas it is &s;aid, that I ought not in that place to have demanded an an&s;wer of my being hindered the former day; After having fir&s;t prote&s;ted, that what&s;oever I have &s;aid above in refe|rence to my &s;elf, upon the &s;econd day, hath not been upon any account or obligation that I have or ought of an&s;wering any charge, accu&s;ation, or recrimination again&s;t me; but only out of the de&s;ire that I have by all ho|nourable means to retain the good opinion of his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty, as being &s;o great a Prince and Friend of the King my Ma&s;ter, and which I have neither forfeited yet, and may po&s;&s;ibly de&s;erve further before my going away (unle&s;s upon &s;ome unhappy interrup|tion from other per&s;ons:) I add next, that none but the King my Ma&s;ter knowes what I ought to have done, and therefore I de&s;ire that all expre&s;&s;ions to the contrary may be omitted for the future.

<PB N="204" REF="111">
he is mentioned in this place, the &s;aid Sir <HI>John Hebdon</HI> being ten years before free from the Service of <HI>Cartwrite,</HI> and being he who procured the remanding of <HI>Nightingale</HI> from <HI>Novogorod</HI> and his detaining here &s;ome time, till he got away as privately as he came, and never daring to repaire to the &s;ight of his late Maje&s;tie of ever ble&s;&s;ed memorie, or of his Maje&s;tie now reigning, dyed like a villain at <HI>Riga.</HI> But indeed the near <HI>Boyars</HI> and Coun|&s;ellors did very prudently, when upon their urging this matter upon me as a truth and realitie, they made difficulty to admit the &s;aid Sir <HI>John Hebdon,</HI> though then required by me according to the de&s;ire of his Royal Ma|je&s;tie, and though at the &s;ame time Forainers were all the while pre&s;ent to &s;pie and ob&s;erve my di&s;cour&s;e concerning his Maje&s;ties affaires. For they could not be ignorant that Sir <HI>John Hebdon</HI> was able to give a pertinent account of all the Impo&s;tures of the &s;aid <HI>Nightingale,</HI> and in two minutes to have di&s;covered the nakedne&s;s of all that fal&s;hood, which for want of Audience all this time has gone cur|rent for a truth of great authority. And as for that <HI>Cartwrite,</HI> if being oppre&s;t by &s;ome of the late <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;tie of ever glorious me|morie His Mini&s;ters, he &s;ought abroad any re|paration contrary to his late Maje&s;ties of ever ble&s;&s;ed memorie will or knowlege, I have no|thing to &s;ay for him at this time.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="111">But, whereas the &s;aid near <HI>Boyars</HI> and Coun|&s;ellors, pa&s;&s;ing from that rea&s;on of taking away the Privileges upon occa&s;ion of the late Rebellion, are plea&s;ed to alledge &s;everal Mi&s;|carriages of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> here in their way of trading in this Country, I confe&s;s it is &s;ome thing new to me. And it &s;eemes thereby to appeare (which I am unwilling to believe) as if the &s;aid <HI>Boyars</HI> knew &s;ome other rea&s;ons than his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ties generous re&s;ent|ment of the injuries and inhumanities done to his late Maje&s;tie of ever ble&s;&s;ed memorie for the taking away tho&s;e Privileges. Which being &s;o contrary to what the King my Ma&s;ter hath always believed, and that from &s;everal expre&s;&s;ions in his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ties own Let|ters, I am therefore the le&s;&s;e prepared to an|&s;wer. Yet thus much I &s;hall &s;ay, after minding the &s;aid near <HI>Boyars</HI> and Coun&s;ellors of his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;tie, that their allegations had been more weighty, had they named the parti|cular per&s;ons guilty of &s;uch mi&s;carriages; as fir&s;t to their not furni&s;hing of his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Trea&s;ury, wherewith they are charged. The Merchants have from time all along, yea to the very time of his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ties taking away of their Privileges, furni&s;ht his Trea&s;ury with Cloth, Tyn, Lead, Pewter, and all other Commo|dities of the growth and manufacture of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> at prices farr cheaper than the <HI>Dutch</HI> or <HI>Hamburghers</HI> did or could deliver them, if
<PB N="206" REF="112">
their Commodities were an&s;werable to tho&s;e furni&s;ht by the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> And it is affirmed by the Company of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants, that their Servants and Factors have at &s;everal times of|fered to deliver goods into his Maje&s;ties Trea|&s;ury at the prices they co&s;t there in <HI>England,</HI> but they would not be accepted. And when they have been accepted or received into his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Trea&s;ury, the Factors here could very &s;eldome or never get their monies with|out great bribes to his Officers, nay &s;everal of them could never get any thing for their goods &s;o delivered. And the &s;aid Merchants do and can ju&s;tly affirme that his Trea&s;ury hath not &s;uffered in that particular, but that they have been much &s;ufferers in what they have delivered for want of good payment. As to their dealing with Tobacco, the Companies care and orders were &s;uch (each member being under an oath to ob&s;erve the &s;ame) that if any man trading under the Privileges were known or found to have any, it was pre&s;ently taken and burnt before the <HI>Ru&s;&s;es</HI> his Subjects, whereof many pre&s;idents may be produced. So that in this particular of what is &s;aid there is nothing proved, no not &s;o much as any one in&s;tance of any one member of the Com|pany trading here under the Privileges. As to buying of &s;trangers Commodities, the Mer|chants privileged here, have ever been &s;o farr from dealing in prohibited Commodities, as
<PB N="207" REF="112">
al&s;o from taking or meddling with any &s;tran|gers goods to carry them from Archangel to <HI>Mo&s;cow</HI> cu&s;tome-free, and &s;o defraud his Maje&s;tie of his cu&s;tomes, that they have from time to time made very &s;trict orders to the contrary. So that if any per&s;on were found faulty in that particular, he &s;hould be delivered to the Emperors laws and not be protected by the Agent or Company there re&s;iding. Nay further of late years the Company have been &s;o fearful to offend in colouring &s;trangers goods, that they have made &s;trict orders to prohibit all trade with the <HI>Dutch, Hamburg|hers,</HI> or any other &s;trangers, either at <HI>Arch|angel</HI> or any other place in his Dominions.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t Merchants being dead, It was never under&s;tood (as farr as I know) by the <HI>Tzar</HI> his Predece&s;&s;ors here, nor (I am &s;ure) by the Kings of <HI>England</HI> there (who by their Amba&s;&s;adors capitulated and made agree|ments in which the Companies Privileges were included) that tho&s;e Privileges were made only to particular and individual men, and that when tho&s;e men &s;hould dy, the Privileges &s;hould cea&s;e and dye with them. For it was then under&s;tood that the Privileges granted was a due to the Nation; and not only tho&s;e men which were then nominated, but like|wi&s;e to tho&s;e who &s;hould &s;ucceed them in the trade.</P>
<P>And for what belongs the Petition of the

<HI>Goe&s;s</HI> and all other Trade&s;men of the <HI>Mu&s;co|vian</HI> Dominions, and all the pretences which are hudled together again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mer|chants; I &s;hall only &s;ay at pre&s;ent that it &s;eemes natural enough to me that the <HI>Go&s;es,</HI> a &s;mall number of per&s;ons, might de&s;ire thereby to ingro&s;s the whole trading to their own hand, though to the prejudice of the generalitie of his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ties &s;ubjects. But that the whole Trade&s;men of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> who receive great advantage from the traffick with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> &s;hould in that manner petition, &s;eemes not &s;o probable becau&s;e le&s;s rea&s;onable.</P>
<P>Therefore pa&s;&s;ing over all &s;uch colours or realities, which may ea&s;ily be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in &s;uc|ceeding Conferences, unle&s;s this new and abrupt an&s;wer &s;hall give me occa&s;ion wholly to give over the bu&s;ine&s;s, I &s;hall my &s;elf &s;ay roundly (inviting thereby the near <HI>Boyars</HI> and Coun&s;ellors of his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;tie to the &s;ame way of proceeding) that if the Privile|ges were only taken away upon occa&s;ion of the late Rebellion and the Impo&s;tures of <HI>Luke Nightingale,</HI> as hath been given to under&s;tand to the King my Ma&s;ter, that therefore the &s;ame Impo&s;tures being now di&s;covered, and the &s;aid Rebellion being extingui&s;hed and pardoned, and his Maje&s;tie now de&s;iring by me that they may be re&s;tored again; It is now therefore time for his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;tie here|by to redouble the former obligation upon
<PB N="209" REF="113">
the King my Ma&s;ter. But if the&s;e other Pre|tences were the &s;ole or the concurrent rea&s;ons of their taking away, His Maje&s;tie is ready by me both to invigorate the execution of any good orders formerly made for the preven|ting the like mi&s;carriages, and al&s;o to make for the future &s;uch further provi&s;ion and re|gulation, as may &s;ecure the intere&s;t of his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty and Subjects. And there|fore however the King my Ma&s;ter de&s;ireth that before all things the &s;aid Privileges may be revived, not that thereby there is any ad|vantage or gain to his Royal Maje&s;ty, who could willingly &s;hoot away yearly as much powder as the value of them comes to at the health of his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty his dear and loving Brother. Nor that the Merchants his Subjects have thereby (as is alleged) &s;o inricht them&s;elves in any compari&s;on with what the Subjects of his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty have reaped this hundred years from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade. For on the contrary the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> merchants have in their free way of living and expen&s;e in the Country rather &s;trove to defray only and main|tain the friend&s;hip with the inhabitans than to accumulate wealth to them&s;elves; Which yet if they had done they could not be envyed nor ought to be reproached therewith by tho&s;e, who&s;e Country hath by their benefit drawn in the Commerce and riches of all <HI>Europe.</HI> Nor yet that his Maje&s;ty expects herein, as it

<P>In this Conference my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador did al&s;o intreat his Commi&s;&s;ioners, that he might have a private Audience of his <HI>Tzars|koy</HI> Maje&s;ty, thinking to finde more favour from the <HI>Tzar,</HI> as concerning his mo&s;t impor|tant affaires, if he could him&s;elf in&s;till into his Maje&s;ties ears his &s;trong and &s;olid rea&s;ons, with the eva&s;ions and friendle&s;s dealing of the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners. But, as if they had fir&s;t re&s;olved to grant nothing at all, it was hard enough to my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador to obtain this Audience; And when at la&s;t they told him of the day, appointed for that purpo&s;e by his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty, they &s;aid it was not for any bu&s;ine&s;s &s;ake, but to compleat their great Lords brotherly love and friend&s;hip with his Royal Maje&s;ty, as if that could be done meerly by &s;eeing the <HI>Tzar</HI> private. My Lord Amba&s;&s;ador finding this an&s;wer as much unfit for his bu&s;ine&s;s as it is ridiculous, made them to under&s;tand, how Princes in former Age and mo&s;t in this had, and have by &s;uch imme|diate Intercour&s;e, occa&s;ion fuller to inform them&s;elves of all matters, and to remove a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ob&s;tacles.

Then indeed he &s;poke at length with all the advantage he could de&s;ire him&s;elf, and added to the &s;trength of rea&s;oning the eloquence of the language. He refuted, as much to the purpo&s;e as could be, all his Commi&s;&s;ioners Objections before alledged, whereupon they purpo&s;ed to ground the <HI>Refu&s;al of the Priviledges,</HI> he repre&s;ented to his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty how little of &s;olidity there is, that they are but weak pretences, and that his Royal Maje&s;ty mu&s;t needs be much &s;en&s;ible of this proceeding &s;o contrary to his expectations.

<P>HAving continued here ten weeks &s;ince your Tzarskoy maje&s;ty ap|pointed me your near Boyars and Coun|&s;ellors Commi&s;&s;ioners, and finding my &s;elf &s;till further of every day from any good &s;ucce&s;s of my Negotiation, I have been forced, as tho&s;e who cannot get over the violence or winding of the river, to make up to the fountain. Your Tzarskoy maje&s;ty is through your &s;o great Dominions the only Fountain of Power and Rea&s;on, and as all your &s;ub|jects ought to humble them&s;elves to your power, &s;o dare I &s;ubject my &s;elf to your Rea&s;on. Fora&s;much as it &s;eemes to me that God has given, as to <HI>Solomon,</HI> not only riches and honor to your Tzarskoy maje&s;ty, but al&s;o an under|&s;tanding heart; So that as there was none among your Tzarskoy Progeni|tors

Your Tzars|koy was then plea&s;ed to appoint me Commi&s;&s;ioners, per&s;ons of great no|bility

and experience, for which I give Your Tzarskoy maje&s;ty thanks, and wi&s;h I could as ju&s;tly give You thanks al&s;o for their affection (all of them, to the amitie and good corre&s;pondencie betwixt the two Crowns, and for their expedition in the bu&s;ine&s;s committed to them. But when as I at my fir&s;t Conference according to his Royal ma|je&s;ties order moved fir&s;t for the Re&s;titu|tion of the Privileges, &s;ignifying in the &s;ame writing that the&s;e being gran|ted I had other things to profer on his Royal maje&s;ties part out of his affection to your Tzarskoy maje&s;ty, I received from my Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;o unexpected an an&s;wer, that had heaven faln as the windowes of the Coun&s;el-chamber broke in twice at the recital, it could &s;carce have been more &s;trange or mira|culous to me.

Rebellion. But after that they affirm that his late Royal maje&s;ty of ever ble&s;&s;ed memorie by <HI>Luke Nightingale</HI> de&s;ired that the Privileges might be nulled, then they allege &s;everal mi&s;|carriages of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants, after that a petition of the <HI>Go&s;es</HI> and all the Traders in <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> then that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants are dead. In a &s;econd paper they &s;peak of Your warrs with the <HI>Crim</HI> and the <HI>Pole,</HI> that his Royal maje&s;ty furni&s;hed not your Tzarskoy maje&s;ty with mony, that the Merchants of the <HI>Mo&s;covia</HI> Companie refu&s;ed to lend mony towards your Tzarskoy maje&s;ties warrs being de&s;ired by your Amba&s;&s;a|dors. And &s;everal other rea&s;ons to make up the number though any one of them would have &s;erved, if it be indeed re&s;olved before hand not to grant the Privileges, but altogether will not com|pound one &s;olid argument, if weighed by &s;o piercing and deep a judgement as that of Your maje&s;ty. So that my

Commi&s;&s;ioners, wholly cutting off all hopes of the Privileges for the pre&s;ent in&s;i&s;ted only that I &s;hould declare to them what el&s;e I had to offer from his Royal maje&s;ty. And I profering to them, that if they had any thing as that remained on their part, and was proper for them to propound for your Tzars|koy maje&s;ties &s;ervice, I &s;hould give them a fitting an&s;wer. And only de&s;iring to be re&s;olved by them, whether in ca&s;e my propo&s;als &s;hould &s;eem to them equi|valent to the Privileges they had then power to grant them, they could not or did not give me any &s;ati&s;faction therein. I appeale to your Tzarskoy maje&s;ty, whether I having a plenipo|tential Letter from his Royal maje&s;ty to your Tzarskoy maje&s;ty (which is in it &s;elf &s;ufficient) and over and above that a particular Commi&s;&s;ion under the great &s;eale of <HI>England</HI> for the Recovery of the privileges, it were fit for m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> further to divulge the &s;ecrets of his

For they were &s;o from the fir&s;t a voluntary grant, and I do not love to go le&s;s as (God be prai&s;ed) I need not than any of my Predece&s;&s;ors.

of the Trade at Archangel, with the lo&s;s of many mens lives, &s;hipping and e&s;tates; though great Princes even for an action once well done, and whereof the fruit dyes with that time and per|&s;on, are u&s;ed to recompen&s;e to perpe|tuity. But my chief motive for &s;uch a preliminary de&s;ire was indeed your Tzarskoy maje&s;ties honour, of which I &s;hall always be mo&s;t tender, that as your Tzarskoy maje&s;tie took away the Privileges out of Your high genero&s;ity and re&s;entment of the late Rebellion, &s;o it might appeare to the whole world by Your rein&s;tating the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> therein, without any farther reach of rea&s;on, only upon their return to their Obe|dience and my de&s;ire, how ju&s;t and perfect You were in the proportioning of Your actions, and how like that great Prince you are, you know to place Your Obligations upon me. For that is amity to me which is the advantage of my Subjects, and if even in my Exile
<PB N="264" REF="141">
I could not but partake &s;ome joy in their wellfare, certainly upon my happy return I &s;hall by all means &s;trive to procure and advance it. To what purpo&s;e are &s;o many Treaties in the World betwixt Princes, but all for the con&s;tituting the conveniencies and profit of their Subjects? Treaties of Peace, of Trade, of A&s;&s;i&s;tance, nay even of Marriage of the Princes are they, becau&s;e tho&s;e Princes fall in love with one another; or are not all directed to the &s;ecurity and pro&s;perity of the people?

<P><PB N="278" REF="148">This &s;peech being thus ended, my Lord Am|ba&s;&s;ador added four Memorials, which he gave al&s;o in writing, but in a paper by it &s;elf. Three of them were again&s;t <HI>Pronchi&s;&s;of,</HI> who endeavoured by all meanes to ob&s;truct my Lords affaires, and to make him odious to this Court. It &s;eemes he had told my Lord that his Royal Maje&s;ties affaires were in a dangerous and weak condition, &s;o that my Lord being confident that he had &s;trove to in&s;til this fal&s;e report into the <HI>Tzars</HI> ear, thought him&s;elfe bound upon this occa&s;ion to inform his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty, that what he &s;aid therein was contrary to the truth, and maliciously invented by Enemies of his Royal Maje&s;ty, and that the King was in as good condition of quiet at home and power abroad as any Prince in Chri&s;tendom.</P>
<P>Another time the &s;ame <HI>Pronchi&s;&s;of</HI> told my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador at his hou&s;e in the pre&s;ence of <HI>Dement&egrave; Ba&s;hmacof</HI> and of a Colonel <HI>van Staden</HI> their Interpreter, that it was reported his Excellency had received a great &s;umme of mony of the Merchants to recover the Privi|leges, and upon the effecting thereof was to receive yet greater from the &s;aid Merchants; whereupon my Lord requiring his author he would or could name none; &s;o that his Ex|cellency took him for the Author him&s;elf, as it was very likely. Therefore upon this occa|&s;ion he acquainted the <HI>Tzar</HI> with it, and de|&s;ired
<PB N="279" REF="148">
his Maje&s;ty to cau&s;e Reparation to be given him by the &s;aid <HI>Pronchi&s;&s;of</HI> for &s;o mali|cious and high a &s;lander.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the &s;aid <HI>Pronchi&s;&s;of</HI> at &s;everal other times &s;poke to my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador, as if he had neglected his Royal Maje&s;ties bu&s;ine&s;s in re&s;pect to the Merchants, and threatned him with the <HI>Tzars</HI> di&s;plea&s;ure, that he &s;hould not depart with honour, and as if his <HI>Tzars|koy</HI> Maje&s;ty would complain of his conduct to his Royal Maje&s;ty, who&s;e in&s;tructions he &s;aid that my Lord had tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed. In all which things he much dimini&s;hed the re&s;pect due to his Excellency, and doubtle&s;s exceeded any Commi&s;&s;ion from his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty: My Lord did not neglect to informe his Maje&s;ty of all the&s;e things upon this pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, and to tell Him, that for the&s;e and for the former rea&s;ons he takes the &s;aid <HI>Pronchi&s;&s;of</HI> (who was at this Audience) to be an Enemy to the good corre&s;pondence betwixt his Royal Ma|je&s;ty and his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty, and con&s;e|quently no Friend to him&s;elf. And that there|fore what&s;oever he might have reported at any time, or would afterwards concerning him, to give his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty (as he had all rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect) an ill ta&s;te and impre&s;&s;ion of him: He de&s;ires his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty to hold it for fal&s;hood, as he him&s;elf was ready to prove it if his Maje&s;ty had thought fit at any
<PB N="280" REF="149">
time to communicate any &s;uch thing to him for his own &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>He put moreover his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty in minde of the former Reparation promi&s;ed, which &s;till his Commi&s;&s;ioners had neglected hitherto.</P>
<P>The 24. of <HI>May,</HI> my Lord received his Com|mi&s;&s;ioners an&s;wer to his papers given at Con|ference the 22. of <HI>March,</HI> wherein fir&s;t they blame his Excellency for &s;aying in the begin|ning, that they mi&s;under&s;tood his words, as if he had a mind thereby to tell them, that they were not able to under&s;tand his meaning. But for the Po&s;ts innocent mi&s;take (as they call it) they &s;ay that &s;atisfaction is given hereto|fore. They do not like at all this expre&s;&s;ion of my Lords, where he &s;aies that they &s;eeme to weigh the generous actions of Princes by <HI>Salotnicks.</HI></P>
<P>As to the &s;everal Demands contained in another paper, none but the &s;econd demand had a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer. The demand is this, that all <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants de&s;iring to repair home might have their pa&s;&s;es to go over &s;ea with their wives and families without any mo|le&s;tation. But it is fru&s;trated by rea&s;on of the next following article, that ju&s;tice might be done the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants for their debts, for of this there was no care at all taken. The next demand to that, which is of a great mo|ment and much again&s;t the cu&s;tome of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI>
<PB N="281" REF="149">
that all his Royal Maje&s;ties Subjects of what condition &s;oever might upon their de&s;ire have full liberty to return, is left without an an&s;wer. Now concerning &s;ome particular &s;ub|jects of the Kings, who looked for the <HI>Tzars</HI> favour or ju&s;tice upon this occa&s;ion by my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador they were all either re|jected or put off.</P>
<P>The 27. of <HI>May,</HI> the Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;ent to my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador their An&s;wer to his Speech &s;aid at the private Audience the 22. of <HI>April,</HI> but as to his Complaints again&s;t <HI>Pronchi&s;&s;of</HI> (who as in &s;pight of his Excellency was &s;till in his <HI>Pri&s;tafs</HI> office) there was not one word &s;aid to that, nor to the other Memorial. And indeed they might as well have left the &s;peech unan&s;wered, &s;eing their writings &s;ignify no more than their &s;ilence. For as heretofore &s;o concerning this &s;peech, that perhaps might have had any where el&s;e a favourable an&s;wer, they &s;ay among&s;t many words very litle or no|ting to the purpo&s;e. Their whole bu&s;ine&s;s it &s;eemes is to catch at &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions, which interpreting alwaies to their di&s;advantage, they take thereby occa&s;ion to give his <HI>Tzars|koy</HI> Maje&s;ty an ill ta&s;t of his Excellency, and &s;o to ob&s;truct his bu&s;ine&s;s. To that purpo&s;e they alledge fir&s;t, that in a place of his &s;peech he calles them per&s;ons of great wi&s;dom and experience (whereas there is, of great nobi|lity and experience) and that in another place
<PB N="282" REF="150">
he writes as if they could not &s;hew in all their an&s;wers one certain or &s;olid rea&s;on for the denyal of the propounded Privileges. They do extreamly wonder at &s;uch an expre&s;&s;ion, and that being a man of great under&s;tanding he would &s;ometimes prai&s;e them (which they take in very good part) and &s;ometimes vilify them. But whereas my Lord &s;aies in another place of his Speech, That he received from his Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;o unexpected an an&s;wer, that had Heaven fallen, as the windows of the Councel-Chamber broke in twice at the reci|tal, it could &s;carce have been more &s;trange or miraculous to him, they are plea&s;ed to &s;ay, that it was not fitting for him to &s;peak &s;o to his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty. But here is the grand &s;candalous and unhand&s;ome expre&s;&s;ion (as they take it) that &s;tickt to the <HI>Tzars</HI> very heart, when his Excellency, &s;peaking as from the Kings Maje&s;ties own mouth concerning that unproportionable &s;um of money that his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ties Amba&s;&s;adors demanded of his Royal Maje&s;ty in <HI>England,</HI> &s;aid, I hope &s;o impo&s;&s;ible a &s;um to the greate&s;t Prince of Chri&s;tendom was not demanded on purpo&s;e to have a pretext to deny the Priviledges, and by propo&s;ing an impo&s;&s;ibility to refu&s;e what is rational. The Commi&s;&s;ioners an|&s;wered, that this unhand&s;ome expre&s;&s;ion was an indignity, not only to the friend&s;hip be|tween both Princes, but chiefly to the per&s;on
<PB N="283" REF="150">
of his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty, that &s;uch a Declara|tion was far from his Royal Maje&s;ties mean|ing, and that therefore their Great Lord would write about it to the King. As for the Priviledges they put them off till the wars be put to an end, and then the Merchants mu&s;t &s;tand upon the <HI>Tzars</HI> courte&s;ie; La&s;tly his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty doth indeed acknowledg the Kings affection to him, where it is &s;poken of tho&s;e fit opportunities, that his Royal Ma|je&s;ty had and might have afterwards of a&s;&s;i&s;ting Him upon all occa&s;ions of War. The Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;aid, that their Great Lord received the&s;e Declarations of the Kings in brotherly, friendly amity and love. Therefore they de&s;ired my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador to declare them, again&s;t which of his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ties Enemies his Royal Maje&s;ty would a&s;&s;i&s;t their Great Lord, and whether with warlike men and ammunition, and if &s;o, with how many warlike men and armes, and with what am|munition, and whether his Royal Maje&s;ty would give this A&s;&s;i&s;tance out of his own Trea&s;ury, and for what time, and to what place the&s;e his Maje&s;ties men were to come. To that my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador gave them this an&s;wer, that in all the&s;e things he was not at all limited, but that they were left at his own be&s;t di&s;cretion, provided fir&s;t, that his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty would &s;hew a ju&s;t value of his Royal Maje&s;ties con&s;tant brotherly
<PB N="284" REF="151">
love and friend&s;hip. But what concernes the propounded Mediation betwixt the <HI>Tzar</HI> and his Maje&s;ty of <HI>Sweden,</HI> it was an&s;wered by the Commi&s;&s;ioners, that there was an Everla&s;ting Peace concluded between Them, and that tho&s;e things that fell out after the Conclu|&s;ion, might be quieted by Me&s;&s;ages on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>As to the Additional Memorials pre&s;ented to the <HI>Tzars</HI> Maje&s;ty again&s;t <HI>Pronchi&s;&s;of,</HI> my Lord had at la&s;t an an&s;wer after a long &s;ollici|tation, but it was too much like their Repa|ration about the mi&s;carriage of our Entrance at <HI>Mo&s;co.</HI> They &s;aid, that my Lord ought not to complain again&s;t him, that what&s;oever he was told by him in familiar di&s;cour&s;es it was not out of malignity, but after a friendly way, &s;o that his Excellency might take care of him&s;elf and of his affaires. As to the Repa|ration promi&s;ed upon his Entrance at <HI>Mo&s;co,</HI> they do not &s;o much as &s;peak one word of it.</P>
<P>And now to put an end to a Negotiation, where &s;o much is &s;aid and &s;o little effected, I &s;hall add another important bu&s;ine&s;s that pa&s;&s;ed betwixt his Excellency and his Com|mi&s;&s;ioners. My Lord having newly received power and authority from the King to offer his Mediation betwixt the <HI>Tzars</HI> Maje&s;ty and the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> thought, that &s;o kind an offer might perhaps bring his bu&s;ine&s;s to a
<PB N="285" REF="151">
better end, than he had done hitherto. He acquainted his Commi&s;&s;ioners with it, and offered him&s;elf to do his uttermo&s;t in pro&s;e|cution of that affair, in what manner his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty &s;hould direct for his Service, Provided that He would fir&s;t manife&s;t a ju&s;t value of his Royal Maje&s;ties mo&s;t &s;incere and con&s;tant brotherly affection, by the grant of his former demands. The offer did plea&s;e them very well, becau&s;e it came in very good time, but the condition annexed was too hard, &s;eeing they had doubtle&s;s re&s;olved not to grant the Priviledges. Yet they de&s;ired my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador to give this matter in writing at a Conference, which they agreed upon to be had the fir&s;t of <HI>June:</HI> and the mean while the <HI>Tzar</HI> appointed for that pur|po&s;e new Commi&s;&s;ioners to treat of this mat|ter that newly was come in hand. [So that at la&s;t his Excellency was rid from <HI>Pronchi&s;&s;of,</HI> whom the <HI>Tzar</HI> had &s;till employed a great while when He &s;ent any me&s;&s;age to my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador, notwith&s;tanding the &s;olemn De|claration made again&s;t him at the private Audience: and in his &s;tead there was another &s;upplied for a <HI>Pri&s;taf,</HI> who was indeed a ci|viller man, but of le&s;&s;er quality.] The Pro|po&s;ition given by my Lord in writing at this Conference was written after this manner.</P>

<P>The Commi&s;&s;ioners An&s;wer to this matter was, that his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty was well plea&s;ed with this profer of his Royal Maje&s;ty, that his Excellency in pro&s;ecution thereof &s;hould &s;end a Po&s;t to his Maje&s;ty of <HI>Poland</HI> by way of <HI>Smolen&s;co,</HI> and proceed him&s;elf in the

Therefore he made them under|&s;tand that otherwi&s;e he could not undertake it, becau&s;e his Royal Maje&s;ty took it for granted, that he had before this effected his bu&s;ine&s;s, which was the rea&s;on of this His la&s;t generous profer.

<P>This being the Negociation and &s;ucce&s;s of the Emba&s;&s;ie, let us now take a pro&s;pect of the mo&s;t memorable pa&s;&s;ages that hapned during our re&s;idence at <HI>Mo&s;co.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing that pre&s;ents it &s;elf is the de&s;cription of a Fea&s;t which the <HI>Tzar</HI> made to my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador the 19. of <HI>February</HI> in the hall wherein his Excellence had Au|dience; it was a meale of near nine houres long, from two in the afternoon till eleven at night. My Lord Amba&s;&s;ador was conducted thither very &s;olemnly, but being entred into the hall, the <HI>Tzar</HI> who was &s;itting upon his Throne forgot not to retain his ordinary gra|vity, and though he had not then his Crown upon his head, he thought it too great a con|de&s;cention for a per&s;on of his grandeur to vaile his bonnet to the Amba&s;&s;ador. From
<PB N="291" REF="154">
whence it may be ea&s;iely conjectured that his Excellence was not admitted to his table, and indeed it was &s;o farr from that, that he was plac't at another on his left hand, &s;ome &s;teps lower than his own, whil&s;t his principal <HI>Boyars</HI> had not only their table on his right hand, but at a le&s;s di&s;tance from his Throne. In &s;o much as in that place where my Lord Amba&s;|&s;ador ought to have received all honor and civility, there it was that they &s;tudied as it were to treat him di&s;obligingly. He was &s;eated alone on one &s;ide next the wall, and on the other there was one of the <HI>Tzars</HI> Councel|ors and a <HI>Stolnick</HI> to bear him Company. In a direct line and near his table they plac't my Lord <HI>Morpeth,</HI> and with him (by expre&s;s or|der from the <HI>Tzar</HI>) not only the Gentlemen and Pages but the Footmen al&s;o, it being his plea&s;ure to regale us altogether.

In the mean time, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r meat not being pre&s;ently brought, mo&s;t

of us imployed our &s;elves in ob&s;erving the great &s;tone Pillar mentioned before, which they had adorned for a Show with a won|derful quantity of Gold and Silver Ve&s;&s;els, among&s;t which there were many curious pieces: In this manner we &s;ate almo&s;t half an hour, before our meat was brought up. At la&s;t the <HI>Stolnicks</HI> entred, with their great bonnets upon their heads, and brought the fir&s;t meat to the <HI>Tzars</HI> Table, pre&s;ently after|wards they &s;erved the <HI>Boyars,</HI> and then my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador and his Train. Our fir&s;t di&s;h was Caviare, which we eat as a Sallad, after which we had a &s;ort of Pottage that was very &s;weet, as al&s;o &s;everal &s;orts of fi&s;h baked, fried, and boyled; but no fle&s;h, becau&s;e it was Lent. Yet that hindered not but that we had near five hundred di&s;hes, which were very hand&s;omely dre&s;&s;ed, had not the di&s;hes been &s;o very black, that they looked more like Lead than Silver. Of all the&s;e di&s;hes they made as it were but one cour&s;e, new coming in continually; but as we had no napkins al|lowed us, &s;o wanted we but little of having no plates al&s;o. All we could obtain for &s;o many di&s;hes was but every one his own, and my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador in that re&s;pect had no advantage of his Servants. Be&s;ides the&s;e we were well provided with very good <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Wine, white and red Mead; Quaz, and &s;trong Waters, which they had tempered with &s;weet
<PB N="293" REF="155">
and odoriferous ingredients. We were not much troubled nor importuned to drink to Exce&s;s, only they would often adverti&s;e us not to forget their great Dukes health. Tho&s;e that attended us were all Gentlemen of quality, which perhaps was the rea&s;on we were not &s;o well &s;erved as we could have wi&s;hed. When meat was brought in, there were twelve of the Guards du Corps ordered to enter, who put them&s;elves in order with their Halbards by the Hall door right over again&s;t his Ma|je&s;ty. After them entered two Lords with the Swords Royal, who approaching the Throne, with a profound Reverence, placed them&s;elves of each &s;ide of the <HI>Tzar,</HI> with their &s;words naked upon their &s;houlders. Night drawing on, they furni&s;hed their Scon|ces with Wax-candles, and a while after the <HI>Tzar</HI> &s;ignified his de&s;ire to di&s;cour&s;e for &s;ome time with the Amba&s;&s;ador. Whereupon his Excellence ro&s;e from the Table, and being come near the <HI>Tzar,</HI> he &s;tood before him on the other &s;ide of the Table, &s;o that they di&s;cour&s;ed face to face. His Maje&s;ty drank a Cup of Wine to the memory of the late King of <HI>England</HI> in the&s;e words, <HI>To the memory of that glorious Martyr</HI> Charles <HI>the fir&s;t, who endured great afflictions here, and enjoyes now a greater mea&s;ure of glory.</HI> After that he drank a health to our pre&s;ent King, and gave the Cup alwaies to the Amba&s;&s;ador with his
<PB N="294" REF="156">
own hand. His Excellence al&s;o at his turn began a health to the two young Princes, and the <HI>Tzar</HI> &s;eeming to neglect it, the Amba&s;&s;a|dor very gracefully intreated him to remem|ber it. Some &s;erious di&s;cour&s;e they had al&s;o about affaires of State, the <HI>Tzar</HI> &s;pake to him about His Wars with the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and his Excellence on his &s;ide failed not to mention to him the &s;ubject of his Emba&s;&s;y, and to let him know he expected &s;ucce&s;s in it from him&s;elf only, and not from his Com|mi&s;&s;ioners. By this time the <HI>de&s;art</HI> came in, and the <HI>Tzar</HI> invited the Amba&s;&s;ador to rake his place at the Table again. The fir&s;t things they brought in, were little artificial trees with &s;tore of branches candyed and guilt at the ends, on purpo&s;e for a &s;hew; the re&s;t were nothing but a kind of fritters, wafers, and &s;uch like trifles in pa&s;te, made up after their fa&s;hion. After we had been about half an hour longer at the Table, the Amba&s;&s;ador ro&s;e again, and turning towards the <HI>Tzar</HI> they drank to one another &s;everal times, the Am|ba&s;&s;ador's Gentlemen having the honour to drink with his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty, and receive their Wine from his own hands. But his Excellence ob&s;erving with what ea&s;e the <HI>Tzar</HI> took off his Goblets, declared to him after a plea&s;ant manner, the ju&s;t &s;u&s;picion he had of his liquour, which apparently could not be &s;o &s;trong as that which was given to him&s;elf.
<PB N="295" REF="156">
The <HI>Tzar</HI> being in a good humour, gave him no an&s;wer, but laughed heartily at it. Yet a while after he found him&s;elf &s;o warmed, that he fell a bleeding at the no&s;e as he was &s;peaking to the Amba&s;&s;ador; who departed thereupon, having fir&s;t given his Maje&s;ty thanks for his magnificent entertainment.</P>
<P>The &s;eventeenth of <HI>March</HI> we celebrated as the birth of the pre&s;ent <HI>Tzar,</HI> who was born on that day in the Year 1630. for which his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty &s;ent us a great dinner, and three or four <HI>Boyars</HI> to rejoyce with the Amba&s;&s;ador.</P>
<P>The third of <HI>April</HI> being Palme-Sunday we had the &s;ight of a very noble Proce&s;&s;ion, which is annually ob&s;erved eight daies before Ea&s;ter, in repre&s;entation of our Saviours En|trance into <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> The <HI>Tzar</HI> invited the Amba&s;&s;ador to &s;ee the Ceremonie; and (their Sledges being then out of date, by rea&s;on the Ice was for the mo&s;t part di&s;&s;olved) &s;ent his Coach with a <HI>Stolnick,</HI> and <HI>Gregory</HI> the <HI>Pri|&s;taf</HI> to accompany him. The Amba&s;&s;ador being about to enter fir&s;t into the Coach, the <HI>Stolnick</HI> had the pre&s;umption to thru&s;t him|&s;elf forward and throw him&s;elf into it as it were headlong before him; and this with &s;uch a di&s;order, that it co&s;t him &s;ome trouble to recollect him&s;elf. His Excellence ob&s;erving his temerity left him in &s;ole po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Coach, and was returning up the &s;tairs, when
<PB N="296" REF="157">
the <HI>Stolnick</HI> came out again in great confu&s;i|on to a&s;&s;ure him, that he had done nothing but by expre&s;s order, and according to their Cu|&s;tome. The Amba&s;&s;ador replied, he knew very well, &s;uch incivilities were not practi&s;ed in other places, and that in <HI>England</HI> the <HI>Tzars</HI> Amba&s;&s;adors had not been u&s;ed in that man|ner. The <HI>Stolnick</HI> under&s;tanding his Excel|lencies re&s;olution not to go at all upon tho&s;e terms, di&s;patched a Me&s;&s;enger immediately to the <HI>Tzar,</HI> to adverti&s;e him of what had pa&s;t, and of the Amba&s;&s;adors per&s;i&s;tence. The <HI>Tzar</HI> was then at his Devotion in the Church of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> (as they call it) near the Ca&s;tle-gate, and all things were ready to be|gin the Proce&s;&s;ion; in&s;omuch as his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty to accelerate the Amba&s;&s;adors arri|val countermanded the orders of the <HI>Stolnick.</HI> Whereupon they departed immediately, and being come to the place that was re&s;erved for us, we found the <HI>Tzar</HI> already gone out of the Church, and marching on foot with his Crown on his head, in the mid&s;t of a great number of <HI>Boyars</HI> and Churchmen; among&s;t which there were two of his principal Coun|&s;ellors of State, that led him by the armes. The Patriarch (a hand&s;ome man and of a good age) had a kind of a Diadem upon his head, and a great Cro&s;s of Gold in his hand: The re&s;t of the Clergy were in their Surplices, and carrying Books, Banniers, Cro&s;&s;es, and
<PB N="297" REF="157">
Images upon long &s;taves before them, &s;ome of them &s;inging, and &s;ome of them fuming the people with Incen&s;e. In this po&s;ture they advanced along upon cloth to a certain Platform, where the Patriach pre&s;ented Palmes to the <HI>Tzar</HI> fir&s;t, and then to the re&s;t. That done he took off the <HI>Tzars</HI> Cap, laid it upon a Silver plate, and pre&s;ented his golden cro&s;s to him to ki&s;s. Which being with great reverence performed, the Patriarch waved it on high to both &s;ides; to them fir&s;t that were in the Platform, who received that Benediction with great reverence likewi&s;e, and then to the People that were pre&s;ent, who at the &s;ame in&s;tant ca&s;t them&s;elves along upon the ground, but more e&s;pecially the <HI>Tzars</HI> Guards who were among&s;t them. After this they &s;ang certain hymns, which lengthned their Devotion a compleat hour. At this time there fell out a very plea&s;ant accident, occa&s;ioned by the Lady Amba&s;&s;adre&s;&s;es maid, mentioned at the beginning of this Narra|tive; who de&s;irous to &s;ee the glory of this Proce&s;&s;ion, had &s;lipt her&s;elf among&s;t my Lord Amba&s;&s;adors Train, into the place appointed for us to &s;ee the Ceremonies. The place being higher than the re&s;t, and uncovered, the <HI>Tzar</HI> lifting up his eyes often towards us, at length took notice of this Maid, and ob&s;erving her well dre&s;&s;ed and near his Excellence (which was more than he had di&s;cerned) he pre|&s;ently
<PB N="298" REF="158">
imagined it was the Amba&s;&s;adors Lady, and &s;ent immediately one of his <HI>Boyars</HI> to enquire of her health. The Amba&s;&s;ador al|together &s;urpri&s;ed with the Complement, returned his thanks to the <HI>Tzar</HI> for his ob|liging intention, and withall gave him notice of the mi&s;take, whereupon the Maid was di&s;mi&s;t with a &s;evere reprehen&s;ion; and being amazed at the &s;trangene&s;s of the adventure departed &s;ilently, confu&s;ed betwixt the honor and &s;hame &s;he had received at the &s;ame time. A while after for default of an a&s;s they brought the Patriarch to the entrance of the Platform a hor&s;e di&s;gui&s;ed like an a&s;s, with great artificial Ears, and (perhaps le&s;t they &s;hould have di&s;covered him to be a hor&s;e by his Coat, or el&s;e have taken him for a red a&s;s) they covered him over with white Linnen. And then having covered his &s;adle with &s;e|veral very rich coverings, the Patriarch mounted by the help of a foot&s;tool, and placed him&s;elf &s;ideling upon the hor&s;e. After that, he ble&s;t the people with his Cro&s;s as he went along, and the <HI>Tzar</HI> having rea&s;&s;umed his bonnet and Crown marched a foot before him leading his hor&s;e by the bridle; as &s;oon as they began their march there was a Chariot drawn by &s;ix hor&s;es covered with white lin|nen al&s;o, that went before them, in which Chariot there was a tree garni&s;hed with a great number of apples, which they had fa&s;t|ned
<PB N="299" REF="158">
to it, and on the Branches five or &s;ix men &s;inging <HI>Ho&s;anna.</HI> The motion of this Tree was &s;o &s;trange to tho&s;e who (not &s;eeing the hor&s;es that drew it) were ignorant of the cau&s;e, that &s;ome of them at fir&s;t &s;ight lookt upon it as a Miracle.</P>
<P>Eight days after this Proce&s;&s;ion we had the Fea&s;t of Ea&s;ter, in which the <HI>Mo&s;covites</HI> have a Cu&s;tome of pre&s;enting one another with coloured Eggs. When they &s;alute one they cry, <HI>Chri&s;tos wos chre&s;t,</HI> which is as much as to &s;ay, <HI>Chri&s;t is ri&s;en,</HI> and the other an&s;wers, <HI>Wo&s;tin wos chre&s;t,</HI> which is, <HI>He is ri&s;en indeed.</HI> They do ordinarily ki&s;s one another in their Salutations, and he which &s;alutes the other, pre&s;ents him with a coloured Egg. This Ce|remony continues fifteen days, in&s;omuch as at that time there are many Shops, in which they &s;ell the&s;e Eggs ready dyed into a red or a Crim&s;on colour. The <HI>Tzar</HI> him&s;elf makes u&s;e of them to his Military Officers re&s;iding in <HI>Mo&s;co,</HI> who coming all of them to ki&s;s his hand, his Maje&s;ty gives each of them an Egg, accompanying his pre&s;ent with his Royal Benediction for the Succe&s;s of their Armes.</P>
<P>On the nine and twentieth of <HI>May</HI> with great joy we &s;olemnized both the birth of his Royal Maje&s;ty, and his glorious Return to his Capital City. His Maje&s;ty and the <HI>Tzar</HI> being born both in the Year 1630. there is
<PB N="300" REF="159">
no great difference in their Age, only the <HI>Tzar</HI> was born the &s;eventeenth of <HI>March,</HI> and is by con&s;equence ten weeks older. In this Fea&s;t his Excellence treated among&s;t o|thers the principal of the three Amba&s;&s;adors, whom the <HI>Tzar</HI> had a while before &s;ent to the King, and who departed from <HI>London</HI> but &s;ome few weeks before us. But that could not be done without the <HI>Tzars</HI> permi&s;&s;ion, who according to their Politicks was much in trouble, ere he could re&s;olve to grant him this grace. And this, notwith&s;tanding the great amity they had contracted at <HI>London,</HI> was the only opportunity they had of &s;eeing one another again. The <HI>Tzar</HI> for the aug|mentation of their Mirth, &s;ent them a good quantity of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Wine and Mead.</P>
<P>My Lord Amba&s;&s;ador entertained the <HI>Swe|di&s;h</HI> Re&s;ident (who was at that time in <HI>Mo&s;co</HI>) very often al&s;o, by which means he had frequent conferences with him.</P>
<P>About this time the Marriage was con|&s;ummated betwixt the good man that had hurt him&s;elf with his fall at <HI>Grave&s;end</HI> the next day after his departure from <HI>London,</HI> and the Maid I mentioned but lately. But the Bridegroom being as yet &s;omething lame of his fall, as <HI>&V;ulcan</HI> was with being tumbled from heaven, it gave occa&s;ion to one to &s;ay, and not unplea&s;antly, that if he plaied <HI>&V;ul|cans</HI>
<PB N="301" REF="159">
part, no doubt but &s;he could play that of <HI>Venus</HI> as well.</P>
<P>I have before repre&s;ented <HI>Mo&s;co</HI> much Sub|ject to fire, and we had three in&s;tances of it during our re&s;idence there. The greate&s;t of all hapned on ea&s;ter day, but devoured only &s;ome hundreds of hou&s;es; and yet there was no more notice taken of it than of the two other. For to make a conflagration remark|able in this Country, there mu&s;t be at lea&s;t &s;even or eight thou&s;and hou&s;es con&s;umed. But they have this advantage at <HI>Mo&s;co,</HI> that they may buy hou&s;es ready made, e&s;pecially in that part of the Town called <HI>Scoradom;</HI> which hou&s;es they take to pieces, and having carryed them to the place where they de&s;igne their habitation, it requires no great time to put them together again. Be&s;ides this they have other great markets where they &s;ell wood for building, and that in &s;uch quantity one may have enough there to build a whole Town.</P>
<P>In this place it was we had experience as well as at <HI>Vologda</HI> of the verity of that &s;aying of <HI>Juvenal.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Maxima quaeque domus &s;ervis est plena &s;uperbis.</HI></P>
<P>Which is that great hou&s;es are commonly furni&s;ht with haughty Servants. And with|out doubt there had been great di&s;order a|mong&s;t the Amba&s;&s;adors Gentlemen, had not
<PB N="302" REF="160">
he prevented it by a re&s;olution which he de|clared of not &s;paring any one that &s;ought to make divi&s;ion by unlawful ways. Notwith|&s;tanding there hapned one duell betwixt one of our family and a &s;tranger that was a Lieu|tenant in the Militia of the <HI>Tzar.</HI> The quarrel was, that being in company together, this la&s;t though a <HI>Scotchman</HI> &s;eemed to extol the grandeur and glory of the <HI>Tzar</HI> to the dimi|nution of the King of <HI>England,</HI> which the other di&s;gu&s;ting magnifyed the King as much as was po&s;&s;ible contrary to the judgment of his Antagoni&s;t, and challenged him thereupon into the field. And &s;ome few days after, this quarrel was di&s;puted by the &s;word, and (had the preeminence of the&s;e Princes de|pended upon the &s;ucce&s;s of that combat) his Maje&s;ty of great <HI>Brittaine</HI> had had the ad|vantage. For in a &s;hort time our Champion di&s;armed the Lieutenant, and came trium|phing among&s;t us that he had vindicated his King.</P>
<P>The &s;ixteenth of <HI>June,</HI> which was four days after my Lord had taken his Leave, the <HI>Tzar</HI> &s;ent the Amba&s;&s;ador a pre&s;ent of Sables, for him&s;elf and his whole family. His Excel|lencies portion was worth two thou&s;and Crownes, that of the Counte&s;s was worth fourteen hundred, and my Lord <HI>Morpeth's</HI> a thou&s;and, the re&s;t were to be di&s;tributed ac|cording to every mans rank and imploiment
<PB N="303" REF="160">
in the hou&s;e. But the Amba&s;&s;ador con&s;idering he had been neglected in all his affaires, would by no meanes admit of this obligation; but from a generous principle returned the Pre&s;ent, as having been otherwi&s;e &s;o much di&s;obliged. Neverthele&s;s, that his refu&s;al might not pa&s;s for an affront in the judg|ment of the <HI>Tzar,</HI> my Lord de&s;igned to have prevented the &s;ending of it, but he had not time enough for that. For <HI>Golozof</HI> (of whom we had occa&s;ion to &s;peak in the De&s;cription of our Entry into <HI>Mo&s;co</HI>) imagining without doubt he &s;hould receive great kindne&s;&s;es from the Amba&s;&s;ador, di&s;patched away one of his Clerks to adverti&s;e him, that he was coming to him with a Pre&s;ent from his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty, wherewith he intended to honour him before his departure. And pre&s;ently af|ter without acquainting any of the <HI>Pri&s;tafs</HI> (in which he did ill) he arrived him&s;elf with four and thirty men bearing the Pre&s;ent in their hands. The Amba&s;&s;ador took <HI>Golozof</HI> a&s;ide, and let him know, that he could not accept of this Honour for the rea&s;ons which he alledged. <HI>Golozof</HI> extreamly amazed ran <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut immediately &s;welled up with rage, as he had been with vain hope of reward at his coming in; he leapt down the &s;tairs by half douzains, as if he had been mad, and clapping his brea&s;t, cried out with a loud voice, That &s;uch a thing had not been heard of, nor ever
<PB N="304" REF="161">
happened before in the whole Empire of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia.</HI> In &s;hort, he was in &s;uch a rage, that one would have &s;worn, he would have cau|&s;ed us all to be bani&s;hed into <HI>Siberia,</HI> as they &s;ometimes did an Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>France,</HI> and that having refu&s;ed the Great Dukes pre&s;ent, they would make us hunt Sables in that Coun|try, which is the penalty of their greate&s;t malefactors. But that which mo&s;t afflicted the Amba&s;&s;ador's Dome&s;ticks, was the di&s;advan|tage they received by his refu&s;al, in being &s;o deprived of the Honour of receiving &s;o pro|fitable te&s;timonies of the genero&s;ity of &s;o great a Prince. However we comforted our &s;elves in the Prudence of the Amba&s;&s;ador, and al|though each of us was deceived in the hopes he had conceived, yet we could not for all that forbear prai&s;ing the genero&s;ity of his Conduct. Whereas on the other &s;ide <HI>Golozof</HI> in very great pa&s;&s;ion mounted his hor&s;e, his footmen following him two and two, where|upon his Excellence took great plea&s;ure to behold them marching in that Order, and the indignation which they carried in their faces. Every one looked after them with a profound &s;ilence, imagining this refu&s;al &s;o Extraordi|nary, that it affronted the Grandeur and Dig|nity of the <HI>Tzar,</HI> and that his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Ma|je&s;ty would not fail to take exemplary ven|geance upon an action &s;o pre&s;umptuou&s;ly bold: others not knowing the cau&s;e &s;u&s;pen|ded
<PB N="305" REF="161">
their judgments. The <HI>Tzar</HI> being in|formed of this affair, and exceedingly &s;ur|pri&s;ed with it, called his Councel of State immediately, and was pre&s;ent there him&s;elf; the re&s;ult of which was, that <HI>Volinskoy</HI> (one of the new Commi&s;&s;ioners) was deputed to repair to his Excellence, to know the rea&s;on of this refu&s;al, which he performed with more mildne&s;s and di&s;cretion than we had occa&s;ion to hope for. The Amba&s;&s;ador an|&s;wered him, that he was &s;o far from doing it out of any contempt, that on the contrary he looked upon his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ties Pre&s;ent as an effect of his great Genero&s;ity, but that the acceptance thereof would oblige him too far. He acquainted him how his affairs &s;tood, that his Emba&s;&s;y had had no &s;ucce&s;s, and that in this ca&s;e it was not proper for him to re|ceive any favour from his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty till he had fir&s;t received the Ju&s;tice he de|manded. That otherwi&s;e he &s;hould have taken the lea&s;t favour from his hands as a perpe|tual Ornament to him&s;elf and his family, and that &s;till he was ready (provided any good or|der might be taken with his affaires) to receive any te&s;timony whatever of the <HI>Tzars</HI> affecti|on. This gave <HI>Volinskoy</HI> &s;atisfaction in &s;ome mea&s;ure, e&s;pecially when he under&s;tood after what manner <HI>Golo&s;of</HI> had brought the Pre|&s;ents, that is, without the knowledge of his Excellencies <HI>Pri&s;tafs,</HI> who ought fir&s;t to have
<PB N="306" REF="162">
given him notice of the de&s;ign, and thereby prevented the di&s;honour of &s;o publick a re|fu&s;al. So that <HI>Golozof</HI> had no recompence for all his pains, but a grave reprehen&s;ion, for having wanted di&s;cretion in the di&s;charge of this affair. On the other &s;ide the <HI>Tzar</HI> re|turned the Pre&s;ent which he had received at his fir&s;t Audience from the Amba&s;&s;ador to him again, it was a Ba&s;in and Ewer of Silver, parcel gilt, two wrought Silver Di&s;hes, and another Di&s;h of Silver parcel gilt al&s;o. His Excellence received it with this Complement; <HI>I give his Tzarskoy Maje&s;ty thanks for this, and I receive it with as great kindne&s;s as if it had been a greater Pre&s;ent. I &s;hall keep it al|waies by me, becau&s;e it hath had the honour to be in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Tzarskoy Maje&s;ty.</HI></P>

<P>THis Emba&s;&s;y being fini&s;hed, and that which was to have been into <HI>Poland</HI> layd a &s;ide, the Amba&s;&s;ador prepared for his departure towards <HI>Sweden,</HI> choo&s;ing the way by <HI>Riga</HI> in <HI>Livonia</HI> to pa&s;s to <HI>Stockholm</HI> by Sea. And being to Cro&s;s <HI>Livonia,</HI> which is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> de&s;art Country, he di&s;pacht an Expre&s;s with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Letter, to Count <HI>Oxen&s;tern</HI> Governour Genera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

of <HI>Livonia</HI> to de&s;ire, that being upon an Em|ba&s;&s;y towards his Maje&s;ty of <HI>Sweden,</HI> he would plea&s;e to give orders, that at his arrival upon the frontiers he might be accommodated at his own co&s;t with fre&s;h hor&s;es and wagons, for his train and baggage to pa&s;s that Country with all.</P>
<P>In the mean time my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador at|tended by a Regiment of hor&s;e departed from <HI>Mo&s;co</HI> the 24. of <HI>June</HI> about the Evening, with intention to retreat &s;eaven Ver&s;ts that night from the Town. The 29. we arrived at <HI>Twere</HI> the cheif City of <HI>Twer&s;co.</HI> The 3. of <HI>July</HI> we came to <HI>Tar&s;ock,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Budeva.</HI> The 4. to <HI>Wi&s;ny Vol&s;ock,</HI> the 7. to <HI>Zimnogoray</HI> and <HI>Volday,</HI> the 8. we pa&s;t, by <HI>Rakina</HI> and <HI>Vena</HI> two Townes, the 9. we lodged at <HI>Brunitze</HI> a little Borough. The 10. in the afternoon we made 27. Ver&s;ts by water in twenty boats they had provided again&s;t our coming, &s;o as (pa&s;&s;ing a &s;mall Arm of the Lake <HI>Ilmin</HI> into which the River, that pa&s;&s;es by <HI>Brunitze</HI> falls) we arrived within 3. Ver&s;ts of <HI>Novogorod</HI> the great. The 11. the Am|ba&s;&s;ador made his Entry into <HI>Novogorod.</HI> The 12. we departed, and on the 13. we pa&s;t 67. Ver&s;ts, 37. upon the <HI>Ilmin</HI> before noon by the favour of a good wind, and 30. after to a Town called <HI>Soltza</HI> upon the River <HI>Solognae</HI> which ca&s;ts it &s;elf likewi&s;e into the Lake. The next day the Amba&s;&s;ador parted from
<PB N="308" REF="163">
<HI>Soltza</HI> by land, and advanced 35. Ver&s;ts. The 17. he made his Entry into <HI>Ple&s;co,</HI> and the 20. at night he departed from thence. The 22. we arrived on the frontiers at <HI>Nihui|&s;en,</HI> a <HI>Village</HI> in <HI>Livonia,</HI> the 25. at <HI>Marien|borough,</HI> and the 3. of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> at <HI>Riga.</HI></P>
<P>Our Journey from <HI>Mo&s;co</HI> to the frontiers (which was near two hundred leagues) was made under the conduct of two <HI>Pri&s;tafs,</HI> one of them called <HI>Jvan Stepanovitz Telepniof,</HI> one of the great <HI>Dukes Stolnicks</HI> conveyed his Excellence and took care of our Carriages and provi&s;ions to <HI>Novogorod,</HI> the other (called <HI>Simon Offona&s;&s;evitz</HI>) conducted us from <HI>No|vogorod</HI> to the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Nihui&s;en</HI> upon the frontiers. The greate&s;t part of this Journey we made on hor&s;back, except when we went by water from <HI>Brunitze</HI> to <HI>Novogorod,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Soltza.</HI> For which rea&s;on we had commonly three&s;core &s;adle hor&s;es in our company, be&s;ides what were in out carriages which we had covered &s;ome to travail in, and &s;ome to retreat to at any time upon oc|ca&s;ion of rain. Be&s;ides the&s;e we had three Coaches, one of the Amba&s;&s;adors, and two of the grand <HI>Dukes,</HI> which he had the Genero|&s;ity to &s;end along with us as far as <HI>Livonia,</HI> principally for the accommodation of the Gen|tlemen. For our baggage we had u&s;ually two hundred wagons, but little ones &s;uch as they
<PB N="309" REF="163">
are in <HI>Mo&s;covie.</HI> Four times we changed them in our Journey, as likewi&s;e our &s;adle hor&s;es, at <HI>Twere,</HI> at <HI>Wi&s;ny Vol&s;ock,</HI> and at <HI>Soltze,</HI> at <HI>Ple&s;co;</HI> We having always a party of <HI>Strelitz</HI> and another of our own attending the baggage. This manner of travailing on hor&s;back had been very plea&s;ant, had not the &s;adles been &s;o hard and &s;o high as they u&s;e them in that Country: but they were made in that fa&s;hion, that mo&s;t of us were in a &s;hort time in as much torment as we could have been upon the wooden hor&s;e.</P>
<P>All the Lodging we had in this Journey, was like that of Soldiers in the fields or woods, under the &s;helter of our Tents or covered wagons; upon which con&s;ideration, the <HI>Tzar</HI> had among&s;t other things provided us with three tents, one for the Amba&s;&s;ador which co&s;t near five hundred crownes, another for the Counte&s;s, and the third for my Lord <HI>Morpeth.</HI> The tents were &s;ent before from place to place with the Kitchin, and the greate&s;t part of our baggage, and we making ordinarily 20 or 25 Ver&s;ts in the morning, and as much after dinner, they pitcht them where they found water, and fields convenient for &s;o great a number both of hor&s;es and men. So as his Excellence arriving with his train at the End of his &s;tage found his Tents ready pitched, and his meat almo&s;t ready. At night his bed was made under his Tent: But mo&s;t
<PB N="310" REF="164">
part of the Gentlemen and Servants betook them&s;elves to their wagons, and the wagoners to the ground for a lodging.</P>
<P>For what relates to our Victuals we &s;uffered almo&s;t for want of chimneys, the &s;ame incon|venience we had done betwixt <HI>Vologda</HI> and <HI>Mo&s;co.</HI> For be&s;ids that we had generally no|thing but Beef and Mutton, that was mo&s;t comonly roa&s;ted only by the Sun and &s;moak in &s;ome corner of the field where the Cooks had piched their Tents to avoide the wind. But our greate&s;t inconvenience was in our drink, being con&s;trained to drink Mead or Quaz, that was heated and quite dead with the Carriage. Ice would have done very well to have revived it, but it was &s;o precious at that time there was &s;carce enough for the Am|ba&s;&s;adors Table. At <HI>Novogorod</HI> and <HI>Ple&s;co</HI> (of which I &s;hall &s;peak hereafter) we were very well treated, we had all &s;orts of pro|vi&s;ion in abundance, and &s;ack among&s;t the re&s;t co&s;t us nothing, but our paines to de|mand it.</P>
<P>True it is, we met &s;everal difficulties in this Journey, and be&s;ides tho&s;e I am &s;peaking of, we &s;uffered with the greate&s;t impatience the per&s;ecution of the flies. Yet in other re&s;pects it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that our Journey was very plea&s;ant, if we con&s;ider the propi|ciou&s;nes of the weather, the advantage of travailing under the &s;hadow of the Fore&s;ts,
<PB N="311" REF="164">
for the mo&s;t part covered with an incredible quantity of excellent Strawberries, be&s;ides the delight of beholding the Rivers gliding tho|rough the&s;e va&s;t wilderne&s;&s;es. We ob&s;erved &s;even or eight Lakes al&s;o, of which the mo&s;t con&s;iderable were the <HI>Ilmin,</HI> and the <HI>Sveto Ozero,</HI> which &s;ignifies as much as <HI>the holy Lake.</HI> In the middle of this latter there is an Iland encompa&s;&s;ed with &s;everal other little ones, which appear like &s;o many woods about it, and a fair Convent within it, which makes a very agreeable pro&s;pect. As to the <HI>Ilmin,</HI> it is doubtle&s;s one of the goodlie&s;t Lakes in <HI>Europe,</HI> being about fifty miles in length, and thirty miles broad, &s;o that when we pa&s;t over it, we could &s;ee land but on one &s;ide of us. We had at that time a boat, that &s;ayled with a &s;aile of Mat made of Bulru&s;hes. And this abundance of Lakes and Rivers, which gave us occa&s;ion of admiring the beauty of the Country, gave us al&s;o a convenience not unnece&s;&s;ary at this time, and that was oppor|tunity of wa&s;hing our &s;elves, which we did very frequently in this journey, and among&s;t the re&s;t in the <HI>Volga,</HI> which we cro&s;&s;ed once again at <HI>Twere.</HI> But fora&s;much as this Road is not &s;o much u&s;ed by Strangers, as the Road to <HI>Archangel,</HI> our habits appeared &s;o unu&s;ual to the Pea&s;ants, that they no &s;ooner &s;aw two or three of my Lords Servants on hor&s;e-back, but away they run in all ha&s;te to
<PB N="312" REF="165">
their hou&s;es, clapping their doors after them, as if we had been &s;o many ominous Birds, or Spirits come on purpo&s;e to fright them; whereby it came to pa&s;s that in ca&s;e we wanted any thing, there was no hopes of being &s;upplyed by them.</P>
<P>And thus you have had what properly be|longeth to the manner of our Travails, I &s;hall now &s;peak &s;omething of the mo&s;t remarkeable pa&s;&s;ages therein.</P>
<P>It is a Maxime, it &s;eemes, in the Court of <HI>Mo&s;covie,</HI> that the better to &s;et off the Ho|nour they be&s;tow upon Publique Mini&s;ters, they mu&s;t now and then abu&s;e and affront them, and as my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador was re|ceived at <HI>Mo&s;co</HI> according to this Rule, &s;o the Court thought it expedient he &s;hould be u&s;ed after the &s;ame way at his departure. As to their Ceremony in conducting him out of Town, and his accommodation during his whole journey after, it mu&s;t be acknowledged honorable enough, and to his Excellencies very great &s;atisfaction. And indeed to &s;peak freely (con&s;idering the ardency wherewith his Excellence had pro&s;ecuted his Negotia|tion, and the Prophe&s;y of <HI>Pronchi&s;&s;of,</HI> who had told him, That the Great Duke would &s;end him away without any honour at all) their civility was much greater than we had
<PB N="313" REF="165">
rea&s;on to expect. However the Amba&s;&s;ador could not avoid the di&s;order which happened at his departure from <HI>Mo&s;co,</HI> upon occa&s;ion of one <HI>Calthof,</HI> who had put him&s;elf among&s;t his Gentlemen, with de&s;ign to return into <HI>En|gland</HI> with them. This <HI>Calthof</HI> had been in the <HI>Tzars</HI> &s;ervice for &s;ome years, and the time for which he had obliged him&s;elf being expired, his Excellence interpo&s;ed for his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, and obtained it. Neverthele&s;s the <HI>Tzar</HI> having notice that he was going, he &s;ent a Me&s;&s;enger immediately after, as we were marching out of the Town, to recal him, and (which was the wonder) the Me&s;&s;enger did not lo&s;e his way. The Amba&s;&s;ador not con|ceiving it proper to oppo&s;e him&s;elf directly again&s;t the plea&s;ure of his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty, returns <HI>Calthof</HI> to him, but with expectation he &s;hould be pre&s;ently relea&s;ed. But five days afterwards being arrived at <HI>Twere,</HI> his Excellence under&s;tood they had upon a fal&s;e pretence clapped him in Pri&s;on, and u&s;ed him very ill. For which cau&s;e he di&s;patched a Po&s;t to <HI>Mo&s;co</HI> with this Letter in <HI>Latin</HI> di|rected to <HI>Larivon Lopookin, Diack</HI> or Chan|cellor of the Emba&s;&s;y-Office.</P>

And this tran&s;la|tion in appearance was <HI>Golozofs</HI> the great Ma|&s;ter of Latin in that Court, and by who&s;e in|&s;tructions they had played the Criticks &s;o ex|qui&s;itely in the word <HI>Illu&s;tri&s;&s;imus,</HI> and who was much incen&s;t again&s;t the Amba&s;&s;ador, &s;ince his refu&s;al of the pre&s;ents. So as there might be &s;ome prejudice or malice in the tran&s;lation of the Letter.</P>
<P>However it was we found the Governour of <HI>Twere</HI> in &s;o ill an humor, he no &s;ooner heard the noi&s;e of our approach, but he &s;hut up his gates immediately, as if the plague had been in the Country, &s;o that we had nothing to tru&s;t to, but the fields and the &s;uburbs of the Town, near which in a plain we pitcht our Tents. The Town is built on the &s;ide of a hill, the <HI>Volga</HI> running by it, be&s;ides another little River called <HI>Twere</HI> which denominates, the place. We &s;taied there only two whole days lea&s;t we &s;hould di&s;turb the Governour too long, who with out doubt was impatient till he &s;aw us departing.</P>
<P>At <HI>Tar&s;ock</HI> we had the diverti&s;ement of
<PB N="320" REF="169">
&s;eeing a very large Bear dance, it was &s;o tame one might without any danger get upon his back, and ride up and down upon him in that po&s;ture. At the &s;ame place our Chyrurgeon cut off with a Rai&s;or a finger of one of the Pages, which had gangren'd at <HI>Mo&s;co</HI> by occa|&s;ion of a nayle wherewith he had unhappily hurt it.</P>
<P>At <HI>Budeva</HI> we had the news of the great fire which happened on the 29. of <HI>June</HI> at <HI>Mo&s;co</HI> (which was five days after we came a|way) con&s;uming a third part of the Town. I imagined immediately there was &s;omething fatal &s;till in our departure, when I remem|bred the fire had happened at Archangel al&s;o &s;ome few days after we had left that Town. In like manner it was that <HI>Lot</HI> was pre&s;erved, and all his family at the burning of <HI>Sodom.</HI></P>
<P>The 10 of <HI>July</HI> Ma&s;ter <HI>Wat&s;on</HI> who had been recalled by General <HI>Monke</HI> in our fir&s;t Voiage came again to us at <HI>Brunitze,</HI> where we were arrived the day before. He came from <HI>Eng|land</HI> to <HI>Riga</HI> by Sea with &s;ome Equipage for the Amba&s;&s;ador, and pa&s;t the re&s;t of the way to us by land. We were &s;urpri&s;ed at his ar|rival, and very much delighted to &s;ee him again in <HI>Mo&s;covie,</HI> who&s;e ab&s;ence had given us &s;ome regret. The occa&s;ion of his return a|mong&s;t us was chiefly, that he might have the &s;atisfaction to travail with his Excellence the
<PB N="321" REF="169">
re&s;t of our Voiage thorough <HI>Mo&s;covy, Sweden</HI> and <HI>Denmark.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Novogorod</HI> (which &s;ignifies New-town) my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador was received very &s;o|lemnly. But his Excellence having ju&s;t entred the Town, there was an unhappy accident befel an antient per&s;on of quality, that gave &s;ome interruption to the formality. He was very richly apparelled and well mounted, but being weak and his hor&s;e unruly, he was fairly thrown down in the &s;ight of the whole Town, and received much hurt by his fall. At this <HI>Novogorod</HI> our <HI>Pri&s;taf</HI> from <HI>Mo&s;co</HI> left us, and committed us to the care of <HI>Si|mon Offona&s;&s;evitz,</HI> with direction to &s;end back the <HI>Tzars</HI> Coaches and Tents, a&s;&s;oon as the Amba&s;&s;ador was arrived at the Frontiers. Which much troubled the Amba&s;&s;ador, to whom <HI>Volinskey,</HI> one of his Commi&s;&s;ioners, had promi&s;ed at <HI>Mo&s;co,</HI> that the Tents &s;hould attend him as far as <HI>Riga,</HI> in confidence of which promi&s;e his Excellence did not trouble him&s;elf to provide any at his own charges. Being di&s;appointed in this manner, and in no condition to accommodate him&s;elf otherwi&s;e in that place, no wonder if he expre&s;&s;ed his di&s;&s;atisfaction, &s;eeing him&s;elf le&s;t by this trick in a very ill po&s;ture to travel from the Fron|tiers to <HI>Riga.</HI> This <HI>Novogorod</HI> hath been for|merly one of the greate&s;t and be&s;t fortified Townes in all <HI>Mo&s;covie,</HI> of which there are
<PB N="322" REF="170">
&s;till &s;ome marks remaining round about the Town. But at pre&s;ent it is reduced, and of no great circumference, however by rea&s;on of the Commerce it injoies it is well peopled. The Lake <HI>Ilmin</HI> is within a League of the Town, out of which comes the <HI>Volka</HI> or <HI>Volgda,</HI> a very fair River that runs by the Town.</P>
<P>But if we were well received at <HI>Novogorod,</HI> I mu&s;t needs acknowledg the reception we had afterwards at <HI>Ple&s;co</HI> was not inferiour, as if the Governours of the&s;e two Towns had been emulous, which &s;hould give hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Excellence the be&s;t entertainment. Never|thele&s;s by the favour of two accidents the Governour of <HI>Ple&s;co</HI> had the advantage; The fir&s;t was by the unadvi&s;edne&s;s of a Gen|tleman of <HI>Ple&s;co,</HI> who had &s;ei&s;ed, the night before our Entry, upon two hor&s;es belonging to the Amba&s;&s;ador's Train, having found them in the night in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. The Go|vernour was no &s;ooner informed of this action but he apprehended the Gentleman, and &s;en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> him bound to the Amba&s;&s;ador to beg his life which his Excellence ea&s;ily granted upo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> acknowledgment of the indi&s;cretion of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> fact. The other was by the report of a Regi|ment of Thieves <HI>Polanders,</HI> that lay in wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> on purpo&s;e for us, which was &s;o common there was &s;carce any other di&s;cour&s;e in <HI>Ple&s;c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> and (as the news went) they were about five

hundred, under the Command of an one-eyed Serjeant. This tidings alarmed us a little, e&s;pecially when we were told, they had done much mi&s;chief in that Province, and plun|dered &s;everal Villages. But the Governour of the Town in this ca&s;e al&s;o manife&s;ted his Genero&s;ity, and the particular care he had to oblige his Excellence: for he gave us a Convoy of five hundred foot well armed, to &s;ecure our bagage, and defend our per&s;ons again&s;t the attempts of this terrible Cyclops: In this place the Amba&s;&s;ador &s;tayed in ex|pectation of an an&s;wer from the Governour General of <HI>Livonia,</HI> by the return of the Me&s;&s;enger he had &s;ent on purpo&s;e to him from <HI>Mo&s;co</HI> the 14. of <HI>June,</HI> and who had Order to meet him again at <HI>Ple&s;co.</HI> On the 19. of <HI>July,</HI> three days after we arrived there, the Me&s;&s;enger came to us with this An&s;wer from Count <HI>Oxen&s;tern</HI> the Governour Gene|ral, that he had already deputed two Officers to receive his Excellence on the Frontiers, and that he had Orders from the Crown of <HI>Swe|den,</HI> to defray the charges of his Carriages and Entertainment from thence to <HI>Riga.</HI> The Amba&s;&s;ador being &s;urpri&s;ed with the Civility of the offer, and with the particular care that Crown had taken to facilitate his pa&s;&s;age thorough <HI>Livonia,</HI> prepared him&s;elf <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mmediately to depart, but with de&s;ign if po&s;&s;ible to evade &s;o great an Obligation.

<P>THough the e&s;teem I have and ought to have of the ju&s;tice and prudence of his mo&s;t Serene <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty, per&s;waded me that <HI>Calthof</HI> would be di&s;mi&s;t (if not before) at lea&s;t as Soon as my Letters from <HI>Twere</HI> on the 30. of <HI>June</HI> were arrived, yet being advanced as farr as <HI>Ple&s;co,</HI> and having no adverti&s;ment thereof, I have di&s;pacht this me&s;&s;enger again to <HI>Mo&s;co</HI> for that very affair. Which (though to you it may not appear &s;o con&s;iderable as it

And in|deed it would be unju&s;t and contrary to the mutual amity betwixt the King my Ma&s;ter and his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty, &s;hould he who is manife&s;tly now under no farther Obligation, or engagement to his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty, be contrary to his own will, my interce&s;&s;ion, and Your promi&s;es, detained any longer. I do make it my reque&s;t therefore, my Lord Chancellor, that if <HI>Calthof</HI> be &s;till among&s;t You, You would re|pre&s;ent the&s;e things &s;o effectually to his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty, that the amity of our &s;overaignes may receive no dimi|nution from &s;o &s;mall and incon&s;iderable an occa&s;ion.

Nor do I think it imputable to them, if the Tents (for of his <HI>Tzars|koy</HI> Maje&s;ties coach I am not &s;o &s;oli|citous) be taken from me at the Borders at <HI>Nihui&s;en</HI> though if I well under&s;tood <HI>Ockolnickey, Ba&s;ilius, &V;olinskoy</HI> his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to &s;pare me them as farr as <HI>Riga,</HI> and for which rea&s;on I had neglected to furni&s;h my &s;elf at my own charges.

that incompa&s;s it: for which cau&s;e there are con&s;tantly every night great fires made upon the Shores, for the direction of &s;uch as are at Sea. And here it was we had time enough to di&s;charge our &s;elves of our provi&s;ion, which was laid in but for &s;ix days, but what was remaining was &s;o well managed by the Am|ba&s;&s;ador, we had wherewithall to &s;ub&s;i&s;t till we came on &s;hore. For he retrenched his own Table, not only of &s;uperfluities, but nece&s;&s;a|ries, confining him&s;elf to one &s;mall meal in a day: true it is we had mu&s;ick enough to to &s;upply our want of victuals. But mo&s;t of us not being able to live upon Air and Wind like the Camelions, were glad to eat &s;uch meat as the Captain of the Ship could furni&s;h us with, which by misfortune at that time was almo&s;t all corrupted. A &s;trange thing it was to find our &s;elves in a &s;tarving condition, in a Voiage only of an hundred Leagues, after we had pa&s;t another of &s;even hundred and fifty, in great, plenty and abundance. We were in a &s;trait for every thing, as well as fre&s;h meat; Beer and fre&s;h water among&s;t us were grown ine&s;timable. And from hence it was, that his Excellence re&s;erving for his own Table that &s;mall quantity of Beer he had left, he di&s;tributed freely to the greate&s;t part of his Dome&s;ticks, a good proportion of his <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Wine, which was to &s;erve them in&s;tead of Beer. At fir&s;t this Wine &s;eemed to &s;weeten

and alleviate the mi&s;ery they were in, but they quickly found it an aggravation rather: for there was nothing almo&s;t excited thir&s;t like it, and in a place where there was no po&s;&s;ibility of getting any thing to a&s;&s;wage it. But by Providence it fared not &s;o ill with our Shallop, for that no &s;ooner ob&s;erved the extream violence of the Wind, but it returned immediately for <HI>Riga.</HI> And it was very hap|py it did &s;o, otherwi&s;e it would have had much ado to have e&s;caped the danger of a Storm that took us on the 28. at Night, which indeed was very terrible and extraor|dinary.</P>
<P>The 29. the Wind being &s;omewhat fallen, we weighed anchor, with de&s;ign to endeavour the doubling the Cape of <HI>Dome&s;nez,</HI> which we happily performed, and at night after a little calm the wind came about, and proved very favourable and propitious. So that be&s;ides <HI>Dome&s;nez,</HI> we had the &s;ight of &s;everal other Ilands in this Voiage, as <HI>Runen, Abrick,</HI> and <HI>Ouzel.</HI> And it is this multitude of Iles, that makes Navigation &s;o difficult in the <HI>Baltick</HI> Sea, for from thence it comes, that they meet every moment with Rocks, or Shelves, or banks of Sand. And fora&s;much as many Tacks mu&s;t be made to avoid them, there is ordinarily a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;everal winds to make a very &s;mall Voiage. Upon which con|&s;ideration among&s;t others, his Excellence

cho&s;e rather to ride three daies at anchor be|fore <HI>Dome&s;nez,</HI> expo&s;ed to the extremities of the weather, than to return to <HI>Riga,</HI> and lo&s;e the advantage of the progre&s;s he had made already.</P>
<P>The 31. we arrived at the Rocks, called the <HI>Shares,</HI> where we found a pa&s;&s;age betwixt the high rocks, &s;o &s;trait, there was &s;carce room enough for our &s;hip, &s;o as we were in all points in di&s;tre&s;s. When we had pa&s;t that place, we ca&s;t anchor, attending another Wind proper to carry us to <HI>Stockholm</HI> tho|rough the re&s;t of the Rocks. In the mean time the Amba&s;&s;ador di&s;patched Mr. <HI>Mar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">el</HI> his Secretary, and Mr. <HI>Taylor</HI> his Steward in the Boat to <HI>Stockholm,</HI> from whence we were then not above &s;even <HI>Dutch</HI> Miles, or fourteen <HI>French</HI> Leagues. The Secretary was &s;ent to give notice of the Amba&s;&s;adors arrival, and to inform him&s;elf at what time he was to make his Entry into the Town. Mr. <HI>Taylor</HI> was to prepare his Hou&s;e, and to make pro|vi&s;ion of Victuals, through &s;carcity of which, we were at this time reduced to &s;ome Ex|tremity.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of <HI>September</HI> we advanced &s;ome Leagues among&s;t the Rocks, which divided the Sea into &s;everal Channels, as they had been &s;o many Rivers: And as the pa&s;&s;ages are very narrow, &s;o we found &s;everal pieces of Ships that had been wreckt there. But
<PB N="348" REF="183">
that which &s;eemed mo&s;t &s;trange to me was, that I ob&s;erved mo&s;t of the&s;e Rocks almo&s;t covered with trees, though I could not per|ceive any &s;ub&s;tance, that could give them Nouri&s;hment, and where their Roots could fa&s;ten; for there is nothing to be di&s;cerned, but &s;olid matter and entire &s;tone.</P>
<P>The next morning betimes, the Ma&s;ter of the Ceremonies came aboord our Ship, to &s;ignify to the Amba&s;&s;ador from their Maje|&s;ties, the King and Queen Mother, the &s;ati&s;|faction they received at his arrival. But before he could deliver his Complement, we e&s;caped <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ery narrowly from being ca&s;t away. For having weighed our anchors in the morning, to take advantage of the wind that was &s;omething fa|vourable, the Pilot doubling a point to gain the greater benefit by it, the Ve&s;&s;el on a &s;udden ran &s;o near the Rocks; the Pilot in a great fright was forced to tack immediately with all the dexterity he was able, which was not &s;o great, but the Ship &s;truck with her Poop as &s;he was turning about. But by the Grace of God it was done without any other mi&s;|chief than a concu&s;&s;ion, that waked and af|frighted too, all that were then a&s;leep in the Ship. After this our Ve&s;&s;el was managed &s;o well, that at length we gained the point that was &s;o near de&s;troying us, and came to anchor within a League of <HI>Stockholm.</HI> At this time the Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, who was arrived

<P>The 8. of <HI>September</HI> the Amba&s;&s;ador made his Entry, where he received all po&s;&s;ible ex|pre&s;&s;ions of an Amity extraordinary. True <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t is, there was not that Bravery and Cere|mony as at his Entry at <HI>Mo&s;co,</HI> but I dare affirm, there was much more Sincerity, Frank|ne&s;s, and Decorum. And whereas in that the <HI>Mo&s;covites</HI> made demon&s;tration only of their Grandeur and Vanity; The <HI>Swedes</HI> in this made no other expre&s;&s;ion, but of Kindne&s;s &amp; Civility. Their Artillery, which is &s;o dread|ful in the wars, was become here the grateful Proclaimer of Peace and Affection, nothing being to be heard about the Town for an hour together, but the noi&s;e of their Cannon and great Guns. For a&s;&s;oon as the Amba&s;&s;a|dor had left the &s;hip, and was entered with his Train into the Boats, that were &s;ent him by the King, the Fregat gave us a whole round with his Cannon, and whil&s;t we were making for the &s;hore, they &s;aluted him with many from land, &s;o that they made a very

As we pa&s;t along, we had the &s;ight of a Diver, that came up out of a place twenty fathoms deep, into which they let him down out of a &s;hallop with a Cord, to look for the Guns of a Man of War, that had been ca&s;t away there. He was clad all in leather, and &s;ate under a cer|tain Engine, &s;omething like a bell, in which he &s;aid him&s;elf, he had &s;pace enough to breathe, the water comming no higher than his brea&s;t. After this we came to a Bridg covered over with Carpets of Tape&s;try, at which place his Excellence was comple|mented from their Maje&s;ties by one of the principal Senators. And from thence he was conveyed in the Kings Coach, to a Hou&s;e &s;et a part for Amba&s;&s;adors, Their Maje&s;ties having joyned &s;everal of their Gentlemen, Pages, and Footmen to his Train.

Friend, who makes already &s;o great a part of the di&s;cour&s;e, and hopes, as He will one day of the hi&s;tory of Chri&s;tendom. His Maje&s;ty my Ma&s;ter rejoyces ex|treamly in the happy con&s;titution of all Your affaires, and under God attributes it much to Your Maje&s;ties Prudence, that in the conjuncture of &s;o young a King, yet there is no po&s;sibility of other contention here, then that decent conte&s;t, whether You or the Kingdom have a greater &s;hare in Him.

<P>My Lord Amba&s;&s;ador after this Audience imploied mo&s;t of that little time he had to &s;tay in that Court, in bringing the Amity and Alliance between the&s;e two Crowns to a nearer and firmer Connexion. And this was the rea&s;on he had &s;everal conferences with the principal Mini&s;ters of that Kingdom both in publick and private. Among&s;t other things he intimated the de&s;ign the King his Ma&s;ter had to enter into a &s;trict League with that Crown and the Kingdom of <HI>Danemark,</HI> he demon&s;trated the great advantages would accrue thereby, and that without doubt the &s;ecurity of the three Kingdoms of <HI>England, Swedeland,</HI> and <HI>Danemark</HI> would principally depend thereupon. That for this rea&s;on his Maje&s;ty of great <HI>Britain</HI> deputed two Gen|tlemen in quality of his Envoies Extraordina|ry, one to this Court, and the other into <HI>Dane|mark,</HI>
<PB N="362" REF="190">
to the end this affair might be brought to a happy Conclu&s;ion. The de&s;ign was acceptable enough in this Court, which al|waies expre&s;&s;ed a great inclination of uniting them&s;elves more &s;trictly with the Crown of <HI>England.</HI> And as there &s;eems to be naturally betwixt the two Nations of <HI>England</HI> &amp; <HI>Swede|land,</HI> a kindne&s;s and propen&s;ity one to the other, &s;o was it very material, that &s;o good a principle &s;hould be actuated and imployed, and that Art might give perfection to Na|ture.</P>
<P>His Excellence interceded likewi&s;e in the behalf of &s;everal <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants and o|thers, that either had there &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s of concernment, or that de&s;ired &s;ome favour or other. And in this re&s;pect al&s;o my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador found this Court &s;o favourable, that he was &s;ooner weary of a&s;king, than they were of gratifying his Lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>There being at <HI>Stockholm</HI> three Re&s;idents, one from <HI>France,</HI> the other from <HI>Danemark,</HI> and the third from <HI>Holland,</HI> his Excellence had &s;everal Conferences with each of them, and treated them afterwards one after ano|ther with all honourable entertainment.</P>
<P>In the mean time his Excellence had the honour to be regaled by their Maje&s;ties, the King and Queen Mother, in a mo&s;t obliging manner, in a &s;mall Palace &s;ome few Leagues from <HI>Stockholm;</HI> where a&s;&s;oon as he was arri|ved,

The King drank to the Amba&s;&s;ador the King of <HI>Englands</HI> health, but drinking it with more zeal than ordinary, and the gla&s;s being too <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ig, it hapned he &s;pilt a good part of the Wine upon his cloths; which put his Maje&s;ty &s;o out of countenance, that he looked as he would willingly have drunk it again with more caution, if by that means he could have got that di&s;a&s;ter forgotten. After Dinner his Excellence went a hunting in a fair Park well &s;tocked with Deer. The King was there on Hor&s;-back al&s;o, and ob&s;erving his Excellence &s;crupulous of &s;hooting a large Deer that was within his reach, he a&s;ked him why he did not &s;hoot, who an&s;wering, that a &s;maller Deer would be &s;ufficient for him; the King replyed he &s;hould take no care for that, if he left but one he might di&s;po&s;e of the re&s;t as he plea&s;ed. At length his Excellence retired after a long cha&s;e, he being forced to &s;hoot 2. or 3. times before the Doe would fall, and being of his own killing, it was &s;ent imme|diately to his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Some few days after there was a great Ball at which my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador was de&s;ired to be pre&s;ent: where we had opportunity to &s;ee the great Gallants of <HI>Stockholm,</HI> and the po|litene&s;s

it was the &s;incerity of my Lord Am|ba&s;&s;adors di&s;cour&s;e that produced this effect, and that it being too great a ta&s;k for him to repre&s;ent to the Queen, the great honour his Ma&s;ter the King of <HI>England</HI> had for her, and the great &s;ence him&s;elf had of the Favours which he had received from her Maje&s;ty, his Speech had failed him, according to that &s;aying of <HI>Seneca, Curae leves loquuntur, in|gentes &s;tupent; Small cares may be expre&s;&s;ed, great ones are unutterable.</HI> But when I &s;aw the Secretary fall him&s;elf upon the &s;ame rock, and &s;top in the &s;ame place when he in|terpreted the Complement in <HI>French,</HI> then I concluded the thing had been &s;o contrived.

<P>His Excellence having taken his leave in this manner of their Maje&s;ties, he was con|ducted into a large dining Room, where in their Maje&s;ties name he was treated with all kind of Magnificence and Pomp, in the Com|pany of the principal Officers of the Court.</P>

The Ship was called the <HI>Centurion,</HI> and had at lea&s;t fifty Guns mounted, and an hundred and &s;eventy Seamen; &s;o that it was no ea&s;y matter for the mo&s;t part of the Amba&s;&s;adors Servants to find place convenient to lodg them&s;elves.

our &s;elves happily near <HI>Lant&s;ort,</HI> which we left on our right hand, and having di&s;mi&s;&s;ed our Pilots we arrived at the Main-&s;ea.</P>
<P>On the twentieth in the morning leaving <HI>Gotland</HI> on our left hand, we came within &s;ight of the I&s;le of <HI>Bornholm</HI> on the 21. and on the 22. we came to an anchor in the evening betwixt two I&s;lands about twelve leagues from <HI>Copenhagen.</HI> The principal di|verti&s;ement we received all this Voiage was given us by a couple of tame Bears, which we brought with us from <HI>Mo&s;co.</HI> One of them was &s;o gentle, that one might beat him or play with him as with a Spaniel, for he ma|naged his teeth and his claws with that care|fulne&s;s and dexterity, that he never did any body hurt. And having been taught to wre&s;tle, he in a &s;hort time attained to per|fection in it, and took great delight in that recreation. The other that was &s;omething the bigger of the two was of another humour and quality, his plea&s;ure was to &s;uck peoples fingers, in&s;omuch that to endear ones &s;elf to him, there was no more to be done but to put ones finger into his mouth (which was very often done) and &s;uffer him to &s;uck it, as if it were a Teat. Sometimes he would bite a little, or give a pat with his foot if one pa&s;&s;ed by upon the Deck without treating him in that manner. This puts me in mind of what certain Naturali&s;ts have ob&s;erved of this kind

<P>The 23. the wind was contrary till night, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> which we made five or &s;ix leagues by Moon-light, after which we thought fit to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;t anchor, that we might avoid the Shelves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat were about us. On the 24. the Sea was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">overed with &s;o thick a mi&s;t, and agitated <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ith &s;o great a &s;torm, that it was judged be&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or us to lie at anchor all that day.</P>

About <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">alf an hour before we came to anchor, we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;covered a <HI>Dutch</HI> Man of War pa&s;&s;ing on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er way for <HI>Holland.</HI> For &s;ome time &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ould not &s;trike her Flag, which netled our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aptain &s;o, that he gave order &s;even or eight <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ieces of Cannon &s;hould be loaden with bul|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ets to give them admoni&s;hment of their duty.
<PB N="380" REF="199">
And whil&s;t he was attending till the <HI>Hollan|der</HI> came within &s;hot before he gave fire, we perceived them take it down as we were ju&s;t at an anchor. A quarter of an hour after the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ve&s;&s;el pa&s;&s;ed by our Ship and &s;a|luted us with five piece of Cannon, which our Captain returned with three of tho&s;e he had laden with bullet, which he ordered to be &s;hot over them into the Air. The <HI>Hol|lander</HI> after that gave us three more, which we an&s;wered again with one, and &s;o we par|ted. After this the Amba&s;&s;ador &s;ent his Se|cretary into the Town, to give notice of his arrival, and to carry his Credentials to the Chancellor. Whereupon the King &s;ent his Vice-Admiral the &s;ame night, to let his Ex|cellence under&s;tand, with how much joy he received the news of his arrival, and withall to a&s;&s;ure him that he might make his Entry the next day into the City. At the &s;ame time Sir <HI>Gilbert Talbot,</HI> who was but lately arrived in that Court from his Maje&s;ty of Great <HI>Bri|tain</HI> in the Quality of Envoy Extraordinary, came al&s;o to &s;alute his Excellence. The Vice-Admiral &amp; the Envoy came together in a ve|ry fair Barge, in which, being it was night, the Amba&s;&s;adors Lady took the opportunity to go with them into the Town. And though it was very late, and our Ship at anchor about two leagues from the &s;hore, her Lady&s;hip cho&s;e rather to expo&s;e her &s;elf for &s;ome time
<PB N="381" REF="199">
to the darkne&s;s of the night, than to run the hazard of being brought to bed on Ship|board.</P>
<P>The next day we were very near being ca&s;t away in the very harbour. For we &s;truck <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o de&s;perately upon the ground, that in&s;tead of making our &s;olemn Entry into the Town, we had much ado to &s;ave our Ve&s;&s;el from a Wreck. After we had weighed anchor about noon to come up to the Town according to the Vice-Admirals Orders (who had &s;ent us two Pilots for that purpo&s;e from <HI>Copenhagen</HI>) we were &s;o ill &s;teered by them, that we ran on ground immediately, and that with &s;uch violence, that our Ship was above a foot deep in the &s;and. Whereupon the Captain ordered our &s;ailes to be furled and two piece of Cannon to be &s;hot off, to give notice of our Condition to the Town. A while after which the Vice-Admiral him&s;elf arrived with &s;ome Boats full of Anchors and Cables, by means of which good office we di&s;-ingaged our &s;elves by that time it was night, and came to &s;even fathoms water. And if on the one &s;ide the Malevolence or neglect of tho&s;e two <HI>Da|ni&s;h</HI> Pilots was &s;o dreadful, on the other &s;ide we found the Heavens favouring us excee|dingly in &s;ending us a Calm on a &s;udden, after a violent and impetuous wind that had blown very hard till then, &s;o that we came off without any other hurt than a great affright|ment.
<PB N="382" REF="200">
And indeed had the wind continued as &s;trong as it had been before, in all appear|ance there had been no &s;aving of our Ship, and perhaps we &s;hould have had much ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to have &s;aved our &s;elves; whereas by the propitiou&s;ne&s;s of this unexpected Calm, both we and our Ve&s;&s;el were delivered from this great danger. His Excellencies Entry how|ever was put off till the next day, by rea&s;on the Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>France</HI> (Mr. <HI>de Tre&s;lona</HI> Knight of <HI>Maltha</HI>) who was lately arrived at <HI>Copenhagen,</HI> and was not as yet removed from the Hou&s;e re&s;erved for Amba&s;&s;adors, &s;ince he made his Entry. And upon this &s;core it was, that the Vice-Admiral was di&s;patched to his Excellence to excu&s;e this delay.</P>
<P>On <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the 27. of <HI>October</HI> my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador made his &s;olemn Entry with great Magnificence. And if from thence a judgment might be made of their Friend&s;hip to his Maje&s;ty of great <HI>Britain,</HI> we might without all &s;cruple conclude, that the Amity of this Court in that re&s;pect exceeded the affection of the <HI>Swedes.</HI> In the fir&s;t place two noble Gallies and a Galliot came to re|ceive his Excellence and his Train: for the wind was come about &s;o cro&s;s, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to get our Ship up into the Har|bour.

frankne&s;s and civilities which pa&s;&s;ed be|tween them. They vi&s;ited one another very frequently, and that by &s;urprize &s;ometimes, and treated one another with all imaginable Re&s;pect and Court&s;hip.

<PB N="408" REF="213">
Amba&s;&s;adors, there was one more than ordi|narily remarkable on the &s;eventeenth of <HI>No|vember,</HI> which was at the Chri&s;tening the child of my Lady Amba&s;&s;adre&s;s, who was brought to bed about a fortnight before of a Son. It was Chri&s;tened by the King, the Queen, and his Royal Highne&s;s, and was named <HI>Frederick Chri&s;tian,</HI> on a Sunday at night in the Hou&s;e where his Excellence re&s;i|ded. As &s;oon as our Chaplain had admini&s;tred the Bapti&s;m according to the Liturgy of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> the King went to &s;alute my Lady Amba&s;&s;adre&s;s in her Chamber, which was near the Room where the Infant was Baptized.

His Maje&s;ty continued bare all the while, drinking &s;everal Healths with the Amba&s;&s;ador and other great Per|&s;ons of his Court, among&s;t which, the Lord

Trea&s;urer (who had been lately his Amba&s;|&s;ador to the King of <HI>England</HI>) was one. My Lord <HI>Morpeth,</HI> his excellence's Son, entertai|ned the Queen all the time, his Excellence taking only now and then opportunity to addre&s;s him&s;elf to her Maje&s;ty. The Gentle|men and Pages that were attending on his Maje&s;ty were in the &s;ame Room, where they al&s;o had their &s;hare of this Entertainment as well as the re&s;t of the more inferiour &s;ervants who remained in the Court below. At length after about half an hours time, his Maje&s;ty retired with the Amba&s;&s;ador wai|ting upon him. Three daies after his Excel|lence treated his Royal Highne&s;s again very &s;umptuou&s;ly, and after dinner, His Highne&s;s was plea&s;ed to divert him&s;elf in dancing &s;ome howers with his Excellence and his principal Gentlemen. Be&s;ides the&s;e Collati|ons and &s;ome others which I pretermit, his Excellence had two or three daies recreation in hunting the Hare with his Royal Highne&s;s. At other times he took a &s;urvey of what&s;o|ever was mo&s;t remarkable in the City, and among&s;t other things the <HI>Ar&s;enal,</HI> and &s;ome other magazins for their Anmunition &amp; In|&s;truments of War. At our entrance into the <HI>Ar&s;enal,</HI> which we found very fine and in good order, we were &s;urpri&s;ed at fir&s;t, to &s;ee a Coach pa&s;&s;ing before us, as it were by a pe|culiar motion of its own: but the motion was
<PB N="410" REF="214">
performed by wheel-work with a kind of rud|der to &s;teer it. For which purpo&s;e, there were two men placed &s;ecretly within it, one to turn the wheels (which was the rea&s;on it moved) and the other to manage the Stern. They &s;hewed his Excellence the Rarities al&s;o in the Kings Pallace, which were &s;everal very curious pieces of Mechanicks, be&s;ides many Curio&s;ities brought from the remote&s;t Coun|tries. The Rareties were di&s;po&s;ed in five or &s;ix &s;everal appartements on one floor, and indeed were the only ob&s;ervable things al|mo&s;t we &s;aw in that Pallace. Among&s;t other things, in one of the&s;e appartements we had a &s;ight of an excellent piece of Art, which was a little Ship, ready rigged, who&s;e Ma&s;t, Ladders, Sailes and Cannon were all of Ivo|ry. But his Maje&s;ty having a particular de|&s;ire to care&s;s his Excellence, he thought good to &s;hew him his Pallace at <HI>Frederixburgh</HI> which without contradiction is is a mo&s;t mag|nificent and exact Pile.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the King had the Curio&s;i|ty to go and &s;ee the Man of War which brought his Excellence from <HI>Stockholm,</HI> and was then at Anchor in the Harbour atten|ding his departure. This Vi&s;it being made of a &s;uddain, and in the ab&s;ence of the Cap|tain and the greate&s;t part of the other Offi|cers of the Ship, the Seamen were at no &s;mall lo&s;s to receive his Maje&s;ty as he ought
<PB N="411" REF="214">
to have been. Neverthele&s;s that hindered not but his Maje&s;ty left &s;ome tokens of his being there, by a con&s;iderable Pre&s;ent which he &s;ent to the Captain and all the Seamen. The Captain at his return, being de&s;irous to publi&s;h his Maje&s;ties genero&s;ity, thought he could not do it any waies more remarkably than by firing his great Guns, which though in the Night, he di&s;charged &s;o freely at his return to his &s;hip, that the noi&s;e gave the Town an alarm immediately, the drums beating through the &s;treets, and all people running to their Arms, till at la&s;t they under|&s;tood the occa&s;ion, and turned their appre|hen&s;ions into laughter.</P>
<P>About this time my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador had adverti&s;ement from <HI>Mo&s;co,</HI> among&s;t other things, that <HI>Calthof</HI> (who was detained by the <HI>Tzar</HI> after our departure) was con&s;trai|ned to re-engage him&s;elf for two Years in the Great Dukes &s;ervice. He had notice like|wi&s;e, that his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty had di&s;patched an Amba&s;&s;ador to the King of Great <HI>Britain,</HI> to complain of him as a per&s;on that had been deficient in his re&s;pects to the <HI>Tzar</HI> and his principal <HI>Boyars</HI> in the whole proce&s;s of his Negotiation. But the Amba&s;&s;ador having from time to time &s;ent Copies into <HI>England</HI> of all that had pa&s;&s;ed betwixt him and the Commi&s;&s;ioners, and being otherwi&s;e well ad|vi&s;ed, that the King his Ma&s;ter did well
<PB N="412" REF="215">
approve of what he had done, he troubled not him&s;elf with what the <HI>Tzar</HI> &s;hould attempt, being very well a&s;&s;ured (as indeed it after|wards happened) that all his efforts would not be able to &s;hake the rea&s;on and ju&s;tice upon which his conduct was founded.</P>
<P>About the latter end of our Re&s;idence there, there was a publick combat performed in the pre&s;ence of the King, with portable Pumps, or Engins, &s;uch as are u&s;ed frequent|ly in the quenching of great fires. It was managed before the Pallace, betwixt &s;ix or &s;even men one again&s;t another, having &s;everal others appointed for the management of their Pumps, and for &s;upplying them with water from the Canal. Every one di&s;charged upon his adver&s;ary by lifting up the Pipe, and levelling it again&s;t his Enemy, expo&s;ing them|&s;elves to the force of the Engins within fifteen or &s;ixteen paces, and plying their bu|&s;ine&s;s &s;o well, that they left one of the Cham|pions but one eye to guide him back again to his Hou&s;e.</P>

<P>ON the fifteenth of <HI>December,</HI> four days after the Audience of <HI>Cong&eacute;,</HI> his Excel|lence embarqued, and the next day we came to an Anchor before <HI>El&s;inore</HI> (&s;ix <HI>Dutch</HI> miles from <HI>Copenhagen</HI>) where we lay, in expecta|tion of an Ea&s;terly wind.</P>
<P>About this time the Publick Peace began
<PB N="425" REF="221">
to be broke betwixt the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and the <HI>Dutch,</HI> acts of Ho&s;tility being committed on both &s;ides, &amp; though the War was not as yet formally declared, yet the Goods and Per&s;ons of either Nation were &s;ubject to the outrages and depredations of War. Which con&s;ide|ration, without doubt would have been e|nough to have made us apprehen&s;ive of &s;ome di&s;a&s;trous event in our voiage, had not, our earne&s;t de&s;ire of &s;eeing <HI>England</HI> a|gain, and the advantage we had of being in a Man of War &s;o well provided taken a|way all impre&s;&s;ions of fear. True it is we had daily advice of five or &s;ix <HI>Dutch</HI> men of War, which lay to watch for us in the way, and doubtle&s;s for his Excellences &s;ake, would have done their utmo&s;t to have taken us. Yet the greate&s;t part of us thought little of being taken, and expected rather to catch &s;ome prey or other.</P>
<P>For want of a fair wind we lay &s;ix dayes at Anchor before <HI>El&s;inore,</HI> &s;o that we had time enough to take a view of the Town, and the Ca&s;tle which &s;ecures the &s;ame very well. In the mean time we had news of his <HI>Tzarkskoy</HI> Maje&s;ties Amba&s;&s;adors arrival at <HI>London,</HI> and with what coldne&s;s he was re|ceived by the King, who immediately gave him to under&s;tand his re&s;entment of the &s;mall &s;atisfaction his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty had given him in that honourable &amp; &s;plendid Em|ba&s;&s;y

<P>At length on the 23 of that moneth very early in the morning we departed from <HI>El&s;i|nore.</HI> We were &s;carce advanced twenty leagues in our way, but the wind turned about &amp; came cro&s;s as before, &s;o that we were forced back to <HI>El&s;inore.</HI> My Lord Amba&s;&s;a|dor ob&s;erving the uncertainty he was in, and that he was become the pa&s;time of wind and Sea, believed it his mo&s;t expedient cour&s;e to travail by Land. The indignation he had again&s;t lying idle &s;o long in a place, and the Impatience of remaining in &s;o tedious a con|dition, per&s;waded him to a re&s;olution of leaving the Sea, and making his journey by Land, in ca&s;e the Wind did not turn favour|able within four and twenty hours. But the wind blew &s;o &s;trong from the &s;hore, that it was not po&s;&s;ible for us to land, much le&s;s to pro|ceed in our Voiage by Sea. So that it &s;eemed, that not the Sea only, but the Heavens and the Earth al&s;o had &s;et them&s;elves in oppo|&s;ition to the Amba&s;&s;adors de&s;ign.</P>
<P>And on the 28. we had a &s;torm &s;o di&s;mal by rea&s;on of the ob&s;curity of a very dark night, that we were very much amazed to
<PB N="427" REF="222">
find our &s;elves the next morning at anchor near an Iland about two leagues further from <HI>El&s;inore</HI> than we were before.</P>
<P>The 29. the wind not being &s;o high as it had been before, his Excellence prepared for his departure by Land, taking only nine of his Dome&s;ticks with him, and leaving the re&s;t with his Lady, who made her Voiage by Sea. I was one of the nine that attended on the Amba&s;&s;ador, and am for that rea&s;on obliged to give a general account of the manner and occurrences of his Excellencies Journey.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t we cro&s;&s;ed the Iland of <HI>Sealand</HI> pa&s;|&s;ing to <HI>Fredrixburgh,</HI> &s;o that we arrived at <HI>Co&s;&s;or</HI> the la&s;t day of the year.

<P>The Con&s;ideration of the State of the times in which this journey was taken, made his Excellence travail about in this manner, rather than follow his direct road thorough <HI>Holland,</HI> which had been the &s;horter cut. And becau&s;e we were to pa&s;s near the Fron|tiers, the Amba&s;&s;ador thought good al&s;o to conceal his Quality, and travel <HI>incognito,</HI> e&s;pecially after he was out of the Dominions of the King of <HI>Denmark;</HI> by which means he avoided at the &s;ame time another incon|venience, which was the Receptions and Ce|rimonies, which his Dignity without doubt would have drawn upon him in his jorney, which would have much retarded him in his de&s;ign of making all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te into <HI>Eng|land,</HI> whither the King his Ma&s;ter had recall'd him.

<P>The &s;ame day we departed from <HI>Hamburg,</HI> we were &s;urprized with an accident at <HI>Bock|&s;toud,</HI> a Town depending on the Crown of <HI>Sweden.</HI> For being upon the point of de|parting after dinner, and having hired fre&s;h waggons to make three or four leagues that night, it hapned that the Secretaries wago|ner would not &s;tir, unle&s;s there might go along with him another wagoner his Com|rade, who would have been as u&s;ele&s;s to us as his waggon.

<P>The Amba&s;&s;ador being &s;till further off any reparation of the former affront, but rather finding it fixed upon him by the Commi&s;&s;io|ners fir&s;t an&s;wer, and con&s;idering the abrupt &s;triking off the Priviledges, was not in ca&s;e to propound any further matter of State, and therefore replyed only according to the occa&s;ions naturally given him by the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners paper.</P>
<P>That as to the excu&s;e of the Me&s;&s;engers mi&s;&s;ing their way within four miles of <HI>Mo&s;co,</HI> it was &s;carce po&s;&s;ible and not probable, be|cau&s;e the &s;ame fir&s;t day early in the morning, men that came to Sir <HI>John Hebdon</HI> at the <HI>Yaws</HI> from his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty upon a di&s;honour|able occa&s;ion found the way very ea&s;iy.</P>

<P>For he knew that the &s;aid <HI>Doomnoy Duo|ranin</HI> &s;trove upon all occa&s;ions to make his per&s;on odious and to ob&s;truct his affaires.</P>

<P>Al&s;o the &s;aid <HI>Doomnoy Dvoranin</HI> telling the Emba&s;&s;ador one day, that the King of <HI>Poland</HI> had &s;ent a Me&s;&s;enger to his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty, to beg the mercy and grace of his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty to grant him peace, and the Em|ba&s;&s;ador replying, that tho&s;e were terms which the mo&s;t &s;ubjugated Princes did never de&s;cend to, but that he was glad to hear his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ties affairs were in &s;o good a po&s;ture, the &s;aid <HI>Doomnoy Dvoranin</HI> went forthwith and acquainted his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Ma|je&s;ty with the fir&s;t part of the Emba&s;&s;adors reply, but &s;o di&s;gui&s;ed and with &s;o ill a glo&s;s, that he thereby incen&s;ed his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty highly again&s;t the Emba&s;&s;ador.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide his <HI>Tzarkoy</HI> Maje&s;ty having (as is &s;aid) done the Amba&s;&s;ador the honour to invite him to &s;ee the Solemnities of Palm-Sunday, the &s;aid <HI>Pronchi&s;&s;of</HI> afterwards a&s;king the Amba&s;&s;ador how he liked it, and the Amba&s;&s;ador witne&s;&s;ing his &s;atisfaction in &s;o venerable a Ceremony, the &s;aid <HI>Doomnoy Dvoranin</HI> went &s;trait to his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty, and told him, the Amba&s;&s;ador &s;aid it was a pretty Comedy, which al&s;o di&s;plea&s;ed his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty, as good rea&s;on.

the <HI>Doomnoy Dvoranin</HI> him&s;elf only u&s;ed tho&s;e words to the Amba&s;&s;ador, a&s;king him if it were not a pretty Comedy.</P>

<P>But of the&s;e things the Emba&s;&s;ador never &s;poke at any time, till upon this forcible occa|&s;ion of his own vindication. But the &s;aid <HI>Doom|noy Duoranin</HI> having &s;poke di&s;honorably and fa&s;ly concerning the po&s;ture of His Royal Maje&s;ties affairs, and telling him to his face, as if he were a <HI>Po&s;oulnick</HI> or agent of the <HI>Mu&s;|covia</HI> company, and having told the Emba&s;|&s;ador that he neglected his Maje&s;ties affairs in re&s;pect of the Merchants, and threatning him with his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ties di&s;plea&s;ure and that His <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty would com|plain of him to his Royal Maje&s;ty, as if he

<P>The &s;ucce&s;s it &s;eems of that private Audience was this. The Emba&s;&s;ador having together with the <HI>Enli&s;h</HI> Copy &s;ub&s;cribed, given in a <HI>Latin</HI> Copy, tran&s;lated as near as po&s;&s;ible, but not &s;ub&s;cribed but by his Secretary, having only prepared it to &s;ave time, and as an help to their <HI>Ru&s;s</HI> tran&s;lation, becau&s;e one of the Commi&s;&s;ioners <HI>Golozof</HI> under&s;tood <HI>Latin,</HI> this <HI>Golozof</HI> was imployed &s;everal daies to the Emba&s;&s;ador to per&s;wade him &s;ub&s;cribe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he <HI>Latin</HI> tran&s;lation al&s;o.</P>
<P>This <HI>Golozof</HI> pre&s;&s;ed under that colour and pretext, that &s;o many things being &s;aid therein to the honour of His <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Ma|je&s;ty, and of his Royal Maje&s;ties affection toward Him, &s;o that it was mo&s;t fit to con|tinue upon Record, this al&s;o being &s;ub&s;cri|bed, it would be &s;o much the &s;tronger, and as under two witne&s;&s;es. But the Amba&s;|&s;ador refu&s;ed, as not being his own lan|guage.</P>
<P>Yet at la&s;t, though he gue&s;t at the true rea|&s;on, to give His <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty that &s;ati&s;|faction, he &s;ub&s;cribed it with this addition, <HI>Except any difference with the Engli&s;h,</HI> which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;oon as they had obtained they di&s;covered

forthwith their true intention.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t they complain, as if he had &s;poke with di&s;-re&s;pect of <HI>Tzar Ivan Ba&s;ilovich,</HI> where he &s;aith, <HI>That fir&s;t and great Founder of the Amity betwixt the Engli&s;h and Ru&s;&s;ian Crowns, and of the Privileges to the Engli&s;h Nation Tzar Ivan Ba&s;ilovich,</HI> becau&s;e he added not all his other Titles, and they required the Amba&s;&s;ador &s;hould alter that expre&s;&s;ion accordingly, which, how rea&s;onable &s;oever, he did.</P>
<P>Though the Commi&s;&s;ioners, neverthele&s;s the private Audience having been upon the twenty &s;econd of <HI>April,</HI> gave to the Emba&s;|&s;ador a paper of the twenty fourth of <HI>May,</HI> wherein they named the late King only King <HI>Charles,</HI> and his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ties former Em|ba&s;&s;ador the Lord <HI>Culpepper,</HI> the me&s;&s;enger <HI>William Culpepper.</HI> Which horrid, and pro|bably wilful mi&s;take they would never alter till the Emba&s;&s;ador had taken his la&s;t leave of His <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>Then they, as now the Amba&s;&s;adors, ac|cu&s;e him for an expre&s;&s;ion concerning the falling in of the Windows at their fir&s;t abrupt refu&s;al of the Privileges; which notwith+&s;tanding was very true.</P>
<P>And whereas they then, and now the Am|ba&s;&s;adors, lay much load upon an Expre&s;&s;i|on about the loan of ten thou&s;and pood of Silver de&s;ired by <HI>Knez Peoter Semonovich,</HI> as

if the Emba&s;&s;ador therein offered an indig|nity to His <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty, an indig|nity to the friend&s;hip betwixt both Princes, tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed His In&s;tructions, and his <HI>Tzars|koy</HI> Maje&s;ty would, (as he hath now done) complain thereof to His Royal Maje&s;ty: the Emba&s;&s;ador did then only &s;peak in His Roy|al Maje&s;ties per&s;on, I hope that &s;uch a &s;um was not de&s;ired for &s;uch an end, &amp;c.

<P>Then as to the <HI>Doomnoy Duoranin,</HI> not|with&s;tanding &s;o ju&s;t and high a complaint prefer'd again&s;t him, he was the man cho&s;en to come next from His <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty to enquire of the Amba&s;&s;adors health, and was &s;o imployed for many days as afore.</P>
<P>At la&s;t indeed there was another <HI>Pri&s;taf</HI> appointed in his place, truly a much civiler per&s;on, but of le&s;&s;er quality, which is the pre&s;ent Amba&s;&s;ador of His <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty. But it was &s;ignified from His <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maj^t^y^. by <HI>Gregory Co&s;mevich</HI> the other <HI>Pri&s;taf</HI> to the Emba&s;&s;ador, that this removal was upon the <HI>Doomnoy Duoranins</HI> own de&s;ire to be di&s;mi&s;t.</P>
<P>Al&s;o no Reparation was given the &s;aid Emba&s;&s;ador again&s;t the <HI>Doomnoy Duoranin,</HI> but in a paper afterwards delivered, he was ju&s;tified in all the&s;e enormities, and the Am|ba&s;&s;ador accu&s;ed, that after all the&s;e provo|cations, and the charge given up again&s;t him to His <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty, the Emba&s;&s;ador
<PB N="454" REF="236">

<P>Concerning the Entry nothing of Repara|tion would be given.</P>
<P>The Emba&s;&s;ador had during this time a power that came for mediating betwixt His <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty and the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> which he imparted to his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty, and He kindly accepted, but not being plea|&s;ed to effect any thing in the Privileges it fell to the ground.</P>
<P>And therefore the Emba&s;&s;ador having even from the 29. of <HI>February</HI> intimated his de&s;ire to depart, and having been held up from time to time &s;everal moneths to no end, &s;o that he lo&s;t the Winter way to <HI>Riga,</HI> to the prejudice of his Royal Maje&s;ties occa&s;ions, pre&s;sed im|portunately for a di&s;patch, which it was long before he could obtain, and when near ob|taining in one and the &s;ame day had three times contrary orders &s;ent him about his de|parture.</P>
<P>At the Emba&s;sadors taking leave of his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty, recredentials were given him, wherein his Royal Maje&s;ties Title of <HI>Defender of the Faith</HI> was omitted, and con|trary to the mutual tru&s;t due to an Emba&s;sa|dor the Copy was, although he demanded it, flatly refu&s;ed him.</P>

The Em|ba&s;&s;ador, it is true, had for &s;everal rea&s;ons hereafter expre&s;sed re&s;olved, that it became him not to receive the Pre&s;ents, unle&s;s tho&s;e things were rectified.

Which <HI>Lookian</HI> would not endure to hearken

<P><HI>Va&s;ilius Semonovitch Volinskoy</HI> came the next day to the Emba&s;&s;ador, de&s;iring from his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty to be informed of the rea&s;ons why he had refu&s;ed the Pre&s;ents.</P>
<P>The Emba&s;&s;ador it &s;eems had in order to his departure demanded &s;everal things of Common right or courte&s;ie,</P>
<P>As Satisfaction to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants for their old debts and hou&s;es. For this the Commi&s;&s;ioners reduced the debts within twenty &s;ix Rubles according to their account, and for hou&s;es nothing.</P>
<P>That all <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants de&s;iring to re|pair home may have their Pa&s;&s;es to go over Sea with their Wives and Families without mole&s;tation. This had a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer.</P>
<P>But to the third, That ju&s;tice might be done the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants for their debts, there was no care at all of it, but to the con|trary great &s;everity toward them: &s;o that this fru&s;trated the former an&s;wer which was &s;atisfactory.</P>
<P>That all his Maje&s;ties Subjects of what&s;o|ever other condition may upon their de&s;ire have full liberty to return. To which there would no an&s;wer be given in writing: But the verbal an&s;wer was, that they who have

once taken &s;ervice under his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje|&s;ty, though not expre&s;&s;ed for life, yet if not expre&s;&s;ed for term of Years, are thereby Ser|vants as long as his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty plea&s;es. As it &s;eemed they intended to practi&s;e it in the ca&s;e of General <HI>Dyel</HI> and Lieutenant Ge|neral <HI>Drummond,</HI> who were forced &s;o long to march about <HI>Mo&s;co</HI> with his Royal Ma|je&s;ties Letter, and could get none to receive it.</P>
<P>That Collonel <HI>Baily</HI> accu&s;ed of Trea&s;on by <HI>Cherillo Clopoue</HI> might be brought to a &s;peedy trial. Which though his accu&s;er was in Town and promi&s;ed, yet would not be done.</P>
<P>That Collonel <HI>James Mein</HI> exiled with his Wife and Family into <HI>Siberia</HI> might if guilty have mercy, if guiltle&s;s ju&s;tice. See the Ci|vility of the an&s;wer, Collonel <HI>Jacob Mein</HI> is &s;ent into <HI>Siberia</HI> for a great fault, and it is not fit to recal him out of <HI>Siberia.</HI></P>
<P>That Collonel <HI>Cuningham</HI> accu&s;ed of Trea&s;on might be brought to a &s;peedy trial. Which would not be granted.</P>
<P>That Mrs. <HI>Francis Ro&s;e</HI> according to his Royal Maje&s;ties de&s;ires by Letter may have liberty to return into <HI>England,</HI> her Husband al&s;o de&s;iring it. Which was not granted, but her being of the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Religion alledged, as extingui&s;hing her allegeance.</P>
<P>The Emba&s;sador upon a general review of the&s;e and all other pa&s;&s;ages in his Negotia|tion
<PB N="458" REF="238">
gave for an&s;wer and rea&s;on of his Re|fu&s;al, <HI>Defender of the Faith</HI> omitted in the Kings Title, The late Kings Title and Lord <HI>Culpeppers</HI> not amended, No &s;atisfaction about his Entrance, Nor concerning <HI>Pronchi&s;&s;of,</HI> His <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty holding him&s;elf for affronted, &amp;c. The Priviledges as good as refu&s;ed, <HI>Nightingales</HI> Letter pretended to be lo&s;t, No ju&s;tice to <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants, No li|berty for his Maje&s;ties Subjects upon expi|ring of their obligations to depart, Affirmed in writing, that the <HI>Mo&s;covy</HI> Company killed the King, Mrs. <HI>Ro&s;e,</HI> Collonel <HI>Mein,</HI> Collonel <HI>Baily,</HI> &amp;c. Concluding that all the effect of this Emba&s;&s;y had been only the relea&s;e of three <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> common Soldiers (taken pri|&s;oners from the <HI>Pole</HI>) after long &s;ollicitation, and upon condition that two of them &s;hould &s;erve his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty. Adding moreover, That for all the&s;e rea&s;ons he knew, that not having done his Maje&s;ties bu&s;ine&s;s, and lying &s;till under <HI>Pronchi&s;&s;ofs</HI> a&s;per&s;ion of receiving the Merchants money, and accu&s;ed by his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ty of doing an affront to Him, it befitted him not to receive any Pre&s;ent at his hand. Although otherwi&s;e he &s;hould ac|count the lea&s;t favour from his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Ma|je&s;ties hand a perpetual ornament, honor, and obligation to him&s;elf and Family, and would receive though it were but a Cap cloth from Him as a Coronet, and was pre|pared
<PB N="459" REF="238">
at any time when the&s;e things were rectified to receive any te&s;timony of His <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ties remembrance and af|fection.</P>
<P>After this the 24. of <HI>June</HI> the Emba&s;&s;ador departed from <HI>Mo&s;co, Calthof</HI> riding publick|ly and openly in his Train. The Emba&s;&s;ador being about half a mile out of Town, a Wri|ter of the <HI>Po&s;olskoy Precaz</HI> comes in His <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ties name to demand him. The Amba&s;&s;ador at la&s;t let him got hinking it not prudent to adventure his own journey on <HI>Calthofs,</HI> and hoping to gain his di&s;mi&s;|&s;ion; which he tried by two Letters writ back, in his journey, to the <HI>Po&s;olskoy Diack.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e are the Letters the Emba&s;&s;adors complain of in two places, as if the Earle of <HI>Carli&s;le</HI> told them therein, that they did not rightly under&s;tand them&s;elves; Wheras the words are only, <HI>Quor&s;um haec vergant ne&s;cio, neque vos ip&s;i &s;citis qui facitis,</HI> What the&s;e things tend to I know not, neither do you your &s;elves that do them. For indeed who knows what will be the event of all the&s;e actions, unle&s;s he had the &s;pirit of Prophecy? And if the Emba&s;&s;ador had meant to blame the Commi&s;&s;ioners under&s;tanding, he gives them no wor&s;e than he fir&s;t a&s;&s;umed to him&s;elf in this expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>But whereas his <HI>Tzarskoy</HI> Maje&s;ties Emba&s;|&s;adors pretend that <HI>Calthof</HI> was taken away
<PB N="460" REF="239">
becau&s;e his time was not out, and the Amba&s;|&s;ador de&s;ired not leave for him at his de|parture, it is notoriou&s;ly otherwi&s;e. For the Emba&s;&s;ador did day by day urge his depar|ture, and the <HI>Diack</HI> of the <HI>Taynich Deale</HI> an&s;wered, that he might freely depart. For the the time for which he had conditioned was fully expired, and accordingly by the Law of Nations he was free to have departed with the Emba&s;&s;ador of his own Prince, without leave asking ar any other formality. Indeed after the Emba&s;&s;adors departure, the &s;aid <HI>Calthof</HI> was forced by impri&s;onment and other hard&s;hip to take conditions for two Years more.</P>
<P>And this was the accompt his Excellency gave of his fir&s;t Emba&s;&s;y. The An&s;wer given from his Maje&s;ty to the <HI>Tzars</HI> Emba&s;&s;adors was, that he &s;aw no rea&s;on he had to con|demn the proceedings of his Amba&s;&s;ador. That if the Earle of <HI>Carli&s;le</HI> was not perhaps very well informed of the Cu&s;tomes of the Court of <HI>Mo&s;covy,</HI> he had neverthele&s;s been &s;o &s;trangely u&s;ed on &s;everal occa&s;ions, that he had more rea&s;on to complain than his <HI>Tzar&s;|koy</HI> Maje&s;ty. And whereas his Emba&s;&s;adors had very earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed the Friend&s;hip the the <HI>Tzar</HI> had for the King of <HI>England;</HI> the King declared, that he could hardly be per|&s;waded
<PB N="461" REF="239">
of his affection till he &s;aw the Foun|dation re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, <HI>viz.</HI> the Priviledges of the Merchants his Subjects. His Excellency having in this manner been ju&s;tified again&s;t the attempts of the <HI>Ru&s;s</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador, who had u&s;ed all the art po&s;&s;ible to de&s;troy him, in civility he made him a vi&s;it. After which the <HI>Ru&s;s</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador departed for his own Country, not over well &s;atisfied with his Voiage; &amp; a while after his Maje&s;ty di&s;patched Sir <HI>John Hebdon</HI> thither in quality of his En|voy&egrave; Extraordinary, but without any &s;ucce&s;s. So that things continue &s;till in the &s;ame po|&s;ture, betwixt the two Crowns of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Mo&s;covy.</HI></P>
