<P>Neither have I heard, nei|ther is it fit I &s;hould, it was never well in this Kingdom, as Cardinal <HI>Wol&s;ey</HI> ob&s;erved, &s;ince publick de|bates were made the &s;ubject of pri|vate di&s;cour&s;es; but the wi&s;dome of this Government hath better provided that none of the great Con&s;ultations of that mo&s;t Augu&s;t and &s;olemn A&s;&s;embly in the World, &s;hould be publi&s;hed without Their leave.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. L.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very fit it is that people &s;hould &s;tudy to be quiet, and follow their own bu&s;ine&s;s; the neglect of this la&s;t makes men <HI>Idle,</HI> and the times bad; that of the fir&s;t makes them turbulent, and the times dangerous. But did you not hear of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Warre Voted ye&s;ter|day?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R. R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why that is it&mdash;there cannot a Vote pa&s;s at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> for the removing of the ob&s;tructi|on of Trade, but it is cryed at <HI>London</HI> a <HI>Dutch Warre:</HI> with &s;o little judgement do we di&s;cour&s;e
<PB REF="7"> things who are at a di&s;tance that it were our greate&s;t prudence not to judge of them at all; but leave tho&s;e things that are above our le|vel as improper for our con&s;idera|tion, which is rather di&s;tracted than informed by tho&s;e halfe thoughts of things, all who&s;e cir|cum&s;tances come not under our cognizance.</P>

<P>That you mu&s;t excu&s;eme

<P><HI>Viz.</HI> The <HI>Dutch</HI> are u&s;ually of large Statures, hand&s;ome and fair A&s;pects, &s;tronge and able bo|dies, their minds are not le&s;s vigo|rous then their bodies; their tem|per is re&s;olute, their &s;pirit undaun|ted, their nature open and plea&s;ant, their callings beneficial and indu&s;tri|ous; their Genious apt to all Arts, e&s;pecially the Mechanical and Manu|al: their Ambition is their liberty and privilege, which they have maintained this hundred years with much blood and trea&s;ure: their ex|pen&s;es frngal, to the &s;aving of an Egge-&s;hell, they maintaining it for a maxime that a thing la&s;ts longer mended then new: their re&s;pects
<PB N="65" REF="38"> and con&s;iderations are narrow and re&s;trained; their way is active &amp; &s;tir|ring, and Provi&s;ion is made for their nece&s;&s;itous people, but none for the idle, who mu&s;t work there or they &s;hall not eat; the time they &s;pend is in eating well, and drinking much, and prating mo&s;t: <Q>The truth is (&s;aith my ingenious Author) the compleate&s;t Drinker in <HI>Europe</HI> is your <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gallant, there is no &s;uch con&s;umer of Liquor as the quaffing of his Healths; the <HI>Dutch</HI> were good at it, but now they have got a cu&s;tome of pra|ting over their pots, they &s;ip, and laugh, and tell their tale; and in a Tavern are more prodigal of their time then of their Wine, they drink as if they were &s;hort winded, and as it were eat their drink by mor&s;ells and let it down by piece meals, rather be&s;ieging then a&s;&s;aulting their braines; in a word we are Drinkers, they are &s;oakers; an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> man is &s;ooner, a <HI>Dutch</HI> man longer drunk.</Q></P>

<P> Their recreation is warlike, and they are taught to be Souldiers be|fore they have attained to be men; Nay (&s;aith my ingenious and noble friend) as if they placed a Religion in Armes, every Sunday is conclu|ded with the Train-bands marching through the City.</P>
<P>They are rather cunning then wi&s;e, crafty then cunning, and clo&s;e then either; their Commonwealth being managed rather by the &s;ubtle|ty of Trads men, then the policy of States men: their Intelligence is as &s;preading as their Traffick, and their Traffick as large as the World; there being no Nation under heaven to the bottom of who&s;e Coun&s;els, Intere&s;ts and concernes they have not in&s;inuated them&s;elves.</P>

<SPEAKER>I. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>That may appear in that a|bove thirty years &s;ince, over and above the Cu&s;toms of other Mer|chandize, Exci&s;es, Licen&s;es, Waftage and La&s;tage, there was payed to the State for cu&s;tome of Herring and o|ther &s;alt Fi&s;h above 300000. pound in one year, be&s;ides the tenth Fi&s;h, and Cask payed for Waftage, which cometh at the lea&s;t to as much more among the <HI>Hollanders</HI> onely, where|unto

<P>That will appear to be ex|ceeding great by the&s;e following particulars:</P>
<P>During the Warrs between the King of <HI>Spain</HI> and the <HI>Hollanders</HI> before the la&s;t Truce, <HI>Dunkirke</HI> by taking, &s;poiling, and burning the Bu&s;&s;es of <HI>Holland,</HI> and &s;etting great ran&s;ome upon their Fi&s;hermen, en|forced them to compound for great &s;umms that they might Fi&s;h quietly for one year, whereupon the next
<PB N="95" REF="53"> year after the Fi&s;hermen agreed a|mong&s;t them&s;elves to pay a Doller upon every La&s;t of Herrins, towards the maintenance of certain Ships of Warr to waft and &s;ecure them in their Fi&s;hing, by rea&s;on whereof there was a Record kept of the &s;everal La&s;ts of Herrins taken that year, and it appeared thereby that in one halfe a year there were taken 30000. La&s;ts of Herrins which at 16. 20. 30. pound <HI>per</HI> La&s;t a|mounteth to 3600000 and at 16. 20. 30. pound the La&s;t they ordinarily &s;old, then tran&s;ported into other Countries, it cometh at lea&s;t to 5000000 <HI>l.</HI> whereunto if we add the Herrings taken by other Nations, to|gether with the Cod, Ling, Hake, and the Fi&s;h taken by the <HI>Hollanders</HI> and other our Neighbours upon the <HI>Britti&s;h</HI> Coa&s;ts all the year long, the total will evidently ari&s;e to be above 1000000 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>The great trade of Fi&s;hing em|ploying &s;o many men at Sea mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily maintaine as great a
<PB N="96" REF="54"> number of Trades men and Artifi|cers by Land, as Spinners, Hemp|winders to make Cables, Cordage, Yarne twine for Nets, Weavers to make Saile Cloaths, Cecive Pachers, Tollers Dre&s;&s;ers, and Couchers to &s;ort and make the Herring lawful Merchandize; Tanners to Tan their Sailes and Nets; and Coopers to make Caskes, Block and Bowl ma|kers for Shipes; Keelemen and La|bourers for carrying and removing their Fi&s;h; Sawyers for plantiers, Carpenters, Shipwrights, Smiths, Carmen, Boatmen, Brewers, Bakers, and others that cannot otherwi&s;e live with their Wives, Children and Families; every Orphan, Servant, or poor man may venture their &s;tock in Fi&s;hing Voyages, which affords them extraordinary encrea&s;e, and is duly paid according to the propor|tion of their gain.</P>

<P>Though there be nothing in <HI>Holland</HI> but Hops, Madder, But|ter
<PB N="97" REF="54"> and Chee&s;e; yet by fi&s;hing they have plentiful of all manner of pro|vi&s;ion for nece&s;&s;ity, as Corne, Beef, Mutton, Hides, Cloathes; for luxury as Wines, Silkes, Spices, or defence as Pitch, Tarre, Cordage, Timber; all which they have not onely in competent proportion for their u&s;e, but are likewi&s;e able from their &s;e|veral Magazines to &s;upply their Neighbour Country.</P>

<P>Might we not thrive as well as they upon our own Fi&s;h?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>We might no doubt, and have tho&s;e Fi&s;h for nothing that we pay them for, repairing thereby 230. &s;mall Fi&s;her Towns decayed for want of that improve|ment; and adding both honour, &s;trength, and riches to our King and Country, which how ea&s;ily it may be done will appear by &s;ome few Ob&s;ervations following.</P>
<P>By erecting two hundred and fifty Bu&s;&s;es of rea&s;onable &s;trength and bigne&s;s there will be employ|ment made for 1000. Ships, and for
<PB N="98" REF="55"> at lea&s;t 10000. Fi&s;hermen and Mar|riners at Sea, and con&s;equently for as many Tradesmen, and Labourers at Land.</P>
<P>The Herrings taken by the Bu&s;&s;es will afford his Maje&s;ty 200000 <HI>l.</HI> yearly cu&s;tome outward; and for Commodities returned inward 30000 <HI>l.</HI> and above.</P>
<P>We have Timber &s;ufficient, and at rea&s;onable rates growing in our own Kingdome for the building of Bu&s;&s;es, every Shire affordeth har|dy and able men fit for &s;uch imploy|ment who now live poorly, and idle at home.</P>
<P>We have Victuals in great plenty &s;old at ea&s;ie rates, without payment of Exci&s;es, or impo&s;t.</P>
<P>Our Shores and Harbours are near the places where the Fi&s;h do haunt.</P>
<P>For Drink, or Nets, &s;alting and packing our fi&s;h, and for &s;uccour in &s;tre&s;s of Weather, we may bring our Fi&s;h to Land, &s;alt and pack it, and from &s;ome parts of his Maje&s;ties
<PB N="99" REF="55"> Dominions be at our Markets in <HI>France, Spain,</HI> or <HI>Italy</HI> before the <HI>Hollander</HI> can arrive in <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>We have meanes to tran&s;port our Fi&s;h into &s;ome Northern Countries where the <HI>Hollander</HI> &s;eldome or ne|ver come. And though we had as many Bu&s;&s;es as the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> yet is their vent for all, or more, for in Ea&s;t and Northern Countries where the <HI>Hollanders</HI> &s;eldome or never come. And though we had as many Bu&s;&s;es as the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> yet is there vent for all, or more, for in the Ea&s;t and Northern Countries and in many other places, Herrins are eve|ry daies meat, winter and &s;ummer, as well to draw on drink as to &s;atis|fie hunger; and in mo&s;t places the greate&s;t part of the year they be &s;carce to be had; for pre&s;ently after <HI>Michaelmas</HI> the <HI>Sound</HI> and Rivers are frozen up, &s;o as no Herrings can be tran&s;ported into twenty King|domes, and free States untill <HI>July,</HI> which is for thirty weeks &s;pace to|gether, &s;o that when Lent comes
<PB N="100" REF="56"> there are few to be bought for mo|ney. La&s;tly, &s;ince by care and in|du&s;try we gained cloathing from the <HI>Flemmings,</HI> doubtle&s;s &s;o by the &s;ame meanes we may as ea&s;ily grow ex|pert in the art of Fi&s;hing, and in time make it a &s;taple Commodity of our own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. L.</SPEAKER>
<P>What are the general de|fects that hinder our improvement of our Fi&s;hing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>1. General liberty of eat|ing Fle&s;h, contrary to old cu&s;tome, and the &s;tatute Laws provided for ob&s;erving Fi&s;h dayes, from whence our &s;carcity and dearth of fi&s;h pro|ceedeth; for where Fle&s;h is ordi|narily &s;pent fi&s;h will not be bought, and want of &s;ale decayeth all trade, Gaine being the nur&s;e of Indu&s;try.</P>
<P>2. Want of order and di&s;cretion in our fi&s;hing, every man being left to him&s;elf, and permited to fi&s;h as be&s;t liketh him; whereas among&s;t the <HI>Hollanders</HI> two of the be&s;t ex|perienced Fi&s;hermen are appoin|ted to guide the re&s;t of the Fleet,
<PB N="101" REF="56"> all others being bound to follow them, and to ca&s;t their Lines accor|ding to their direction.</P>
<P>3. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> and other Na|tions &s;et forth with their Bu&s;&s;es in <HI>June</HI> to find the Shoale of fi&s;h, and having found it, dwell among&s;t it till <HI>November,</HI> whereas we &s;tay till the Herring come home to our road &s;teads, and &s;ometimes &s;uffer them to pa&s;s by ere we look out, our Herring-fi&s;hing containing onely &s;even weekes at the mo&s;t, and theirs twenty.</P>
<P>4. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> Bu&s;&s;es are great and &s;trong, and able to brook foul weather, whereas our Cables, Crac&s;ers and Boates being &s;mall, and thin &s;ided, are ea&s;ily &s;wallowed by a rough Sea, not daring to adventure far in fair weather, by rea&s;on of their weakne&s;s for fear of &s;tormes.</P>
<P>5. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> are indu&s;tri|ous, and no &s;ooner are di&s;charged of loading, but pre&s;ently put forth for more, and &s;eek for Markets abroad as well as at home; whereas our
<PB N="102" REF="57"> <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> after they had been once at Sea, do commonly never return a|gain untill all the money taken for their Fi&s;h be &s;pent, and they in debt &s;eeking onely to &s;erve the next Market.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hollanders</HI> have certain Merchants who during the Herring &s;ea&s;on do onely come to the places where the Bu&s;&s;es arrive, and joyning together in &s;everal companies, do pre&s;ently agree for the lading of 30. or 40. Bu&s;&s;es at once, and &s;o being di&s;charged t<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter">ey may &s;peedily re|turne to then former Shipping; whereas our Fi&s;hermen are uncer|tain of their Chapmen, and forced to &s;pend much time in putting off their Fi&s;h by parcells.</P>

<P>What Lawes were there made to recover this trade?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was enacted 33. <HI>Hen.</HI> 8.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fi&s;hermen dwelling on the Sea Coa&s;ts did leave off their trade of Fi&s;hing in our Seas, and went the halfe Seas over, and there upon the Seas did buy fi&s;h
<PB N="103" REF="57"> of <HI>Pickards, Flemmings, Normans, Zealanders;</HI> by rea&s;on whereof ma|ny incommodities did grow to the Realme, <HI>viz.</HI> The decay of the wealth and pro&s;perity as well of the Cinque Ports, and Members of the &s;ame as of other Coa&s;t Towns by the Sea &s;ide, which were builded, and inhabited by great multitudes of people, by rea&s;on of u&s;ing and exerci&s;ing the craft and feat of fi&s;h|ing. Secondly, the decay of a great number of Boates and Ships. And thirdly, the decay of many good Marriners, both able in body by their diligence, labour, and conti|nual exerci&s;e of fi&s;hing, and expert by rea&s;on thereof in the knowledge of the Sea Coa&s;ts, as well within this Realme as in other parts be|yond the Seas. It was therefore enacted that no manner of per&s;ons, <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> Denizens, or &s;trangers at that time, or any time after dwelling in <HI>England,</HI> &s;hould buy any Fi&s;h of any Strangers in the &s;aid Ports of <HI>Flanders, Zealand, Picardy, France,</HI>
<PB N="104" REF="58"> or upon the Sea between &s;hore and &s;hore, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This Act by many Continuances was continued from Parliament to Parliament untill the fir&s;t of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> and from thence to the end of the next Parliament and then expired.</P>

<SPEAKER>R. V.</SPEAKER>
<P>How did the <HI>Hollanders</HI> encrea&s;e in Power and Wealths?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. H.</SPEAKER>
<P>It will be a wonderfull thing to &s;ee what a mighty &s;ub&s;i|&s;tence of Wealth, and a huge Na|vigable power that State is come to, by a rare unparalleld indu&s;try; For I dare avouch that the <HI>Roman</HI> Commonwealth, (though &s;he had her head as well knit in her Infancy as any that ever was) did not come near her, in &s;o &s;hort a progre&s;s of time, to &s;uch a growth of &s;trength.</P>
<P>But it &s;eemes all things con&s;pired to rai&s;e <HI>Holland</HI> to this pa&s;s: Fir&s;t, the humour of the people, being patient and indu&s;trious, and of a genious more inclinable to a Demo|cratical Government then to a Mo|narchy:
<PB N="105" REF="58"> Add hereunto the quality of the Country, being every where halfe cut, and as it were inlayed with water, and thereby much for|tified, and made in many places in|acce&s;&s;ible; &s;o that if need were, <HI>Holland</HI> could turn her &s;elf into a huge pond when &s;he li&s;t.</P>
<P>Hereunto concurred a further advantage of &s;cituation, having be|hind her the <HI>Baltique</HI> Sea, which af|fords her all kind of Materials for Shipping, and for all kind of Nutri|ment and Military Forces, <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> both &s;warming with &s;uperfluous people, &s;u&s;pectfull of the <HI>Spaini&s;h</HI> greatne&s;s, and &s;o not un|willing to contribute Auxiliary &s;trength for mutual &s;ecurity and con&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Navigation and Mercautile Ne|gotiation, are two Poles whereon the State doth move, and to both the&s;e it &s;eemes Nature her &s;elf hath expre&s;ly de<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter">igned both Country and People; them by an extraordi|nary kind of propen&s;ity, the Coun|try
<PB N="106" REF="59"> by apt po&s;ition, for having no land to manure it, they plow the very bowels of the deep, the wrink|led forehead of <HI>Neptune</HI> being the furrowes that yields them encrea&s;e.</P>
<P>Moreover, there being great Rivers that &s;lice and cut the Coun|try up and down to di&s;gorge them|&s;elves into the Ocean, tho&s;e Rivers may be &s;aid to pay them tribute, as well as to the Sea; which Rivers branching them&s;elves into large and bearing &s;treams, did &s;o fitly &s;erve one another, and all the whole, that it may be &s;aid, Nature in the frame of humane bodies did not di&s;cover more art in di&s;tributing the veines and arteries, for the ea|&s;ily conveyance of the ma&s;s of blood into each part, as &s;he hath &s;hewed here in di&s;per&s;ing tho&s;e waters &s;o orderly for Traffick.</P>
<P>The&s;e Rivers bring her what the large content of <HI>Germany,</HI> and other Ea&s;tern Countries afford, and &s;he lying between them and the Sea, furni&s;heth them with all far fetched
<PB N="107" REF="59"> <HI>Indian, Affrica,</HI> and <HI>Spaini&s;h</HI> Com|modities.</P>
<P>Here you &s;hall &s;ee the mo&s;t indu&s;t|rious people upon earth making a rare virtue of nece&s;&s;ity, for the &s;ame thing which makes a Parret &s;peak, makes them to labour; For having nothing of their own, yet they bound with all things, and may be &s;aid, to live by the idlene&s;s of &s;ome of Neighbours, I am loath to name here who they are.</P>
<P>Here you &s;hall find a people grow rich al&s;o by that which u&s;eth to im|poveri&s;h others, even by Warrs, for prizes and booties abroad, go to make a good part of their wealth.</P>
<P>Yet in conver&s;ation they are but heavy, of a homely out&s;ide, and &s;low in action, which &s;lowne&s;s carrieth with it a notable per&s;everence, and this may be imputed to the quality of that mould of earth, whereon they dwell, which may be &s;aid to be a kind of &s;tanding pool of Aire: and which is known to have &s;uch a force of a&s;&s;imilation, that when
<PB N="108" REF="60"> people of a more vivacious temper come to mingle with them at the &s;econd Generation, they &s;eem to participate of the &s;oile and aire, and degenerate into meer <HI>Hollanders;</HI> the like is found daily in Hor&s;es and Dogs, and all other Animals.</P>

<P>Good Sir, the manner of their Government?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>T. O.</SPEAKER>
<P>For the manner of their Government, they have upon oc|ca&s;ion an A&s;&s;embly of the General States, like our Parliament, being compo&s;ed of tho&s;e which are &s;ent from every Province upon &s;um|mons, and what the&s;e enact, &s;tands for Law; then is there be&s;ides a Councel of State, re&s;iding for the mo&s;t part at the <HI>Hague,</HI> which at|tend daily occa&s;ions, being rather imployed upon Affairs of <HI>State,</HI> than of particular Ju&s;tice. The mo&s;t po|tent in this Coun&s;el was <HI>Barnavil,</HI> by rea&s;on of his Advocates in <HI>Holland,</HI> and be&s;ides both the&s;e, every Pro|vince and great Town have particu|lar
<PB N="116" REF="64"> Coun&s;els of their own, to all which A&s;&s;emblies, as well of the ge|neral States, as the re&s;t, the Gen|try is called for order &s;ake; But the State indeed is <HI>Democratical,</HI> the Merchant and the Trade&s;man being predominant, the Gentlemen now but few and poor, and even at the beginning the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> &s;aw it &s;afer to rely upon the Towns than them, Neither are the Gen|try &s;o much ingaged in the cau&s;e, the people having more advantage in a Free State, than in a Monar|chy.</P>
<P>Their care in Government is ve|ry exact and particular, by rea&s;on that every one hath an immediate intere&s;t in the State, &s;uch is the equality of Ju&s;tice, that it renders every man &s;atisfied, &s;uch the pub|lick Regularity, as a man may &s;ee their Laws were made to Guide, not to Entrap, &s;uch their Exactne&s;s in ca&s;ting the expence of an Army, as that it &s;hall be equally far from &s;uperfluity and want, and as much
<PB N="117" REF="64"> order and certainty in their acts of War, as in ours of Peace, teaching it to be both Civil and Rich, and they &s;till retain that &s;ign of a Com|monwealth yet uncorrupted, pri|vate Poverty, and publick Wealth, for no one private man there is ex|ceeding Rich, and few very Poor, and no State more &s;umptuous in all publick things.</P>
<P>But the que&s;tion is, whether this being a Free State will as well &s;ub|&s;i&s;t in Peace, as it hath done hither|to in War, Peace leaving every one to attend his particular Wealth, when Fear while the War la&s;ts, makes them concur for their com|mon &s;afety, and <HI>Zealand</HI> upon the lea&s;t &s;ecurity, hath been ever envi|ous at the predominancy of <HI>Holland,</HI> and <HI>&V;trecht</HI> ready to mutiny for Religion; and be&s;ides, it is a doubt whether the &s;ame care and &s;incerity would continue if they were at their con&s;i&s;tence, as appears yet whil&s;t they are but in ri&s;ing.</P>
<P>The Revenue of this State ari|&s;eth

<P>If it be not too trouble|&s;ome to you, a word or two of their Strength, Di&s;cipline &amp; War.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T. O.</SPEAKER>
<P>For their Strength, the nature of the Countrey makes them able to defend them&s;elves long by Land; neither could any thing have indangered them &s;o much as the la&s;t great fro&s;t, had not the Treaty been then on foot, becau&s;e the Enemy being then Ma&s;ter of the field, that renders their Ditches, Mar&s;hes, and
<PB N="119" REF="65"> Rivers, as firm Ground, and by Sea they are able to offend any o|ther.</P>
<P>There belong to the State 2000 Ve&s;&s;els of all &s;orts, &s;o that if the <HI>Spaniard</HI> were entirely beaten out of tho&s;e parts, the King of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France</HI> would take as much pains to &s;uppre&s;s, as ever they did to rai&s;e them; for being our Ene|mies, they are able to give us the Law at <HI>Sea,</HI> and eat us out of all Trade, much more the <HI>French,</HI> ha|ving at this time three &s;hips for our one, though none &s;o good as our be&s;t.</P>
<P>Now that whereupon the mo&s;t part of their Revenue and Strength depends is their Traffick, in which mi&s;tery of State they are at this day the wi&s;e&s;t, for all the Commo|dities which this part of the World wants and the <HI>Indies</HI> have, is Spice, Silk, Jewels, Gold, they are be|come the Conveyors of them to the re&s;t of Chri&s;tendom except us; as the <HI>Venitians</HI> were of old, and all
<PB N="120" REF="66"> tho&s;e Commodities that the&s;e Nor|thern Countreys abound with, and tho&s;e Southern &s;tand in need of, they likewi&s;e convey thither, which was the ancient Trade of the Ea&s;ter|lings; And this they do, having little to export of their own, by buying of their Neighbour Coun|treys the former, and &s;elling them again what they bring back at their own pri&s;es, and &s;o con&s;equently live upon the idlene&s;s of others; And to this purpo&s;e their &s;cituation &s;erves fitly, for the River of the <HI>Rhene,</HI> the <HI>Maze,</HI> and <HI>Skeld</HI> end all in their Dominions, and the Bal|tique Sea lyes not far from them, all which affords them whatever the great Continent of <HI>Germany, Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Poland</HI> yields; then they again lying between <HI>Germany</HI> and the Sea, do furni&s;h it back with all Commo|dities foreign.</P>
<P>To remember &s;ome pieces of their Di&s;cipline, as patterns of the re&s;t, The Watches at Night are ne|ver all of one Nation, &s;o that they
<PB N="121" REF="66"> can hardly concur to give up any one Town.</P>
<P>The Commi&s;&s;aries are no where &s;o &s;trict upon Mu&s;ters, and where he finds a company, thither he re|duceth them, &s;o that when an Army marcheth, the Li&s;t and the Poll are never far di&s;agreeing.</P>
<P>Their Army is ever well Cloath|ed, well Armed, and had never yet occa&s;ion to mutiny for Pay or Victu|als.</P>
<P>The Souldiers commit no where fewer In&s;olencies upon the Burgers, fewer Robberies upon the Coun|trey, nor the Officers fewer Deceits upon the Souldiers.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, they provide well that their General &s;hall have &s;mall means to invade their Liberties; For fir&s;t, their Army is compo&s;ed of many Nations, which have their &s;everal Commanders, and the Commanders are di&s;po&s;ed by the States them|&s;elves, not by the General; And &s;econdly, he hath never an implicite Commi&s;&s;ion left to Di&s;cretion, but
<PB N="122" REF="67"> by rea&s;on their Countrey hath no great bounds, receives daily com|mands what to do.</P>
