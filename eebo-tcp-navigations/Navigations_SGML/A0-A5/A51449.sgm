<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Reader, at fir&s;t View, may &s;uppo&s;e this Hi&s;tory to be written by &s;ome prejudiced hand, and therefore it may Savour of too much Partiality; but if he more deliberately con&s;ult the Actions of this Monarch, and the Reflexions the Cal|me&s;t Spirits of <HI>Europe,</HI> and even his own Subjects have made upon them, we hope the Cen&s;ure may pa&s;s over us. For there be few who allow him not the Epithet of, <HI>Troubler of the Peace of Europe;</HI> in which lea&s;t Part of the Earth, he has cau&s;ed more Blood to be &s;hed &s;ince his mounting the Throne of <HI>France,</HI> than many Ages before had &s;een, and made &s;o many Towns and Villages &s;ink in Fire, that no barbarous Nation dares venture to reckon with him on that &s;core. <HI>Nero</HI> was a <HI>Hea|then,</HI>
<PB REF="4">and yet we have him painted in the blacke&s;t &s;hape, for &s;etting Fire to <HI>Rome,</HI> and Per&s;ecuting the <HI>Chri|&s;tians.</HI> What then could have been expected from tho&s;e Hi&s;torians, had they been to &s;et forth the Actions of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. who is &s;tyled, <HI>The Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King,</HI> who has not only De&s;troyed one Town or City, but laid whole Countries and Provinces Wa&s;te, with Fire and Sword, Per&s;ecuted and De&s;troyed a Million of <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> and joined with <HI>Infidels,</HI> to bring De&s;tru|ction even upon <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> it &s;elf; and, as he Phra&s;es it, <HI>Scorning to be a Slave to his Word,</HI> has counted the mo&s;t &s;acred Leagues and Oaths as Tri|fles, to be made and broken at plea&s;ure, or things only framed to &s;erve his pur|po&s;e, and no longer durable than his Intere&s;t requires.

<HEAD>A VIEW of the LIFE and ACTIONS OF LEWIS XIV. The pre&s;ent King of <HI>France, &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1-50" TYPE="pages">
<P>NOT doubting but many are unacquainted with the Life and Actions of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. of <HI>France,</HI> e&s;pecially as to &s;undry Periods and Particulars; we have undertaken to compile what has materially happened relating to that Prince, who has for many Years, but e&s;pecially of late, made &s;uch a noi&s;e and blu&s;ter in the World, to the damage and di&s;turbance of all Chri&s;tendom, and has, as it were, fat|ted him&s;elf with Chri&s;tian Blood.</P>
<P>After a tedious War between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> (which began in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> IV. and continued by Truces and Intervals in the Reign of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII.) nothing was thought more Expedient to put a &s;top to the Progre&s;s of tho&s;e
<PB N="2" REF="5">Mi&s;eries that equally afflicted both King|doms, than a Match; and, both Parties agreeing, a Marriage was made between <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. (&s;tyled by &s;ome <HI>The Ju&s;t</HI>) and <HI>Anne</HI> of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> the <HI>Infanta</HI> of <HI>Spain:</HI> But although they were both in the Flower of Youth, they deceived for a long time the Expectation of the world, living together in mutual Society Twen|ty-three Years, without any Appear|ance of the Queen's ever being with Child. In&s;omuch, that <HI>France</HI> and all <HI>Europe</HI> &s;u&s;pected one or both of them Defective or Stiril; but at the end of the&s;e Years, when all were out of hopes, a Crotchet came into the Queen's Head, (&s;uppo&s;ed to be put into it by Cardinal <HI>Mazarine,</HI> who Ruled all at Court) To go in Pro|ce&s;&s;ion barefooted to the Chapel of the <HI>Virgin Mary</HI> near <HI>Paris,</HI> whom the Pa|pi&s;ts hold for a very <HI>Lucina,</HI> to demand of her a Son and Heir to the Crown of <HI>France.</HI> And indeed, when a Man &s;ends his Wife abroad to ask for a Child, 'tis but ju&s;t &s;he &s;hould bring one home with her, if &s;he can get it. But, to the pur|po&s;e. As if this, as a Miracle, was to be a&s;cribed to the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin,</HI> and an Effect of the An&s;wer of the Queen's Prayers; according to the time of Child|ing,
<PB N="3" REF="5">the Queen was brought to bed of a Son in <HI>September,</HI> in the Year One thou|&s;and &s;ix hundred thirty and eight. And, that the Miracle might be increa&s;ed, or the better to hu&s;h &s;ome Scruples and Doubts in Court, the Parliament of <HI>Pa|ris</HI> welcomed him into the World with the Salutation of <HI>Dieu donne,</HI> or <HI>Given of God;</HI> conceiving a Birth, as indeed all <HI>Europe</HI> did, (though perhaps in ano|ther &s;en&s;e,) to be Miraculous, after &s;o many Years pa&s;&s;ing over without any Child, and the Father at that time be|ing Indi&s;po&s;ed, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Some things were whi&s;pered abroad at the Birth of this Prince, and although <HI>Mazarine</HI> laboured to &s;till them, yet notwith&s;tanding &s;everal of the Blood-Royal (who had promi&s;ed them&s;elves great Advantages upon the Death of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. who appeared to them very Infirm, as well in Body as Mind,) could not for|bear &s;peaking aloud. And as a pre&s;age of Cruelty, (as it happened to our King <HI>Richard</HI> III. of <HI>England,</HI> and others who have delighted in Blood,) This Prince, contrary to the Rules of Nature, was born with long and &s;harp Teeth; which made many of the Grandees of <HI>France</HI> look upon &s;o unu&s;ual an Accident, as the
<PB N="4" REF="6">fore-runner of ill Luck to the World; and upon that con&s;ideration Mon&s;ieur <HI>Ba&s;&s;am|peire,</HI> a very Judicious Man, and a great Favourite of the Father, wrote to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Greenoble</HI> in the&s;e Words:</P>

<P><HI>IN my la&s;t I gave you the good News of the Queen's being brought &s;afe to Bed of a</HI> Dauphin. <HI>All that I tell you at pre&s;ent is, that her Maje&s;ty Recovers every Day, and the Child is &s;trong and lu&s;ty, and &s;eems to promi&s;e a long Life. There is one thing of him much taken notice of by &s;ome, That his Gums have Teeth pointing out already, and there is &s;carce a Woman that can &s;uffer him to &s;uckle. He &s;ucks &s;o eagerly, that he brings Blood with his Milk; and, upon this ac|count, he has had two Nur&s;es changed al|ready. I pray God this may not be an ill Omen to</HI> France. <HI>We need Princes of a healing and mild Temper, Corro&s;ives not a|greeing with the good of this Monarchy.

<P>This Letter is found in the <HI>Cologne</HI> E|dition of <HI>Mare&s;chal Ba&s;&s;ampeire</HI>'s Memoirs, page 134. in <HI>French.</HI> But to return:</P>
<P><HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. made great Joy for the Birth of this Son, and all <HI>France</HI> &s;hined with Fires of Triumph. And no &s;ooner was he Chri&s;tened, but he was Inaugu|rated into his Principality, as <HI>Dauphin</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> and had given him his Officers and Attendents; the chief of which were his Governe&s;s, a Lady of a Ma&s;cu|line Spirit, and <HI>Hardovine de Perefexi,</HI> who &s;ince obtained to be Bi&s;hop of <HI>Rhodes,</HI> and after that Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Paris.</HI> This Man &s;erved in the nature of his Tutor, being very cunning and politick.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. lay in the Cradle, as we may term it, nothing of Weight or Moment can be expected. But &s;carce was he capable of di&s;tingui&s;hing Right from Wrong, before the Sceptre of <HI>France</HI> dropp'd into his Hand: For <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. declining more and more, at the End of Four Years and a few Months af|ter the Birth of this Son, left the Stage of this World to &s;leep with his Ance|&s;tors. He was the Elde&s;t Son of <HI>Henry</HI> IV. of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> to whom the Hou&s;e of <HI>Valois</HI> had given Place, by the Death of <HI>Henry</HI> III. who was &s;lain
<PB N="6" REF="7">by one <HI>Clement,</HI> a <HI>Jocobine Monk,</HI> with a Con&s;ecrated Dagger, in his Tent, when &s;urrounded by his Army. His Mother was <HI>Mary de Medicis,</HI> of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Medici</HI> of <HI>Florence.</HI></P>
<P>The King, before his Death, publi&s;h|ed a Declaration, bearing Date <HI>April</HI> 12. 1643; by Virtue of which he appointed the Queen as Regent during the Minority of his Son, as likewi&s;e Governe&s;s of the Kingdom; and the Duke of <HI>Orleance</HI> was made her Lieutenant. The Chief of the Council, were the Prince of <HI>Con|de,</HI> and Cardinal <HI>Mazarine,</HI> the latter &s;waying all with the Queen, Mon&s;ieur <HI>Seguire,</HI> Chancellor of <HI>France,</HI> Mon&s;ieur <HI>Bauthlier,</HI> and Mon&s;ieur <HI>Chauvigny:</HI> And the Conduct of the Army on Foot, was given to the Duke of <HI>Enguin,</HI> after|ward Prince of <HI>Conde.</HI> So that <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. giving up the Gho&s;t on the Four|teenth of <HI>May</HI> 1643. this Order pre|vented the Conte&s;ts that would have happened in the Court about Priority. However a Calm did not en&s;ue; for the King was no &s;ooner in his Grave, but Di&s;contents, that in re&s;pect to him &s;eemed &s;tifled, broke out; both People and Grandees being di&s;&s;atisfied with the Cardinal's management of Affairs, and
<PB N="7" REF="7">too great Influence upon the Queen, who Acted all by his Advice; and he being an <HI>Italian,</HI> proceeded to impo&s;e an <HI>Italian</HI> Government in many things, which were highly di&s;gu&s;ted. So that they proclaimed their di&s;plea&s;ures at the Head of an Army, with the Noi&s;e of Trumpets, Drums, and the thundering of Cannon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> taking the Advantage, endeavoured to enlarge their Dominions in the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> where <HI>Don Franci&s;co de Melo</HI> the <HI>Vice-Roy,</HI> be&s;ieged <HI>Rocroy;</HI> but his Army was beaten off by the Duke of <HI>En|guin,</HI> General of the <HI>French</HI> Forces, and a con&s;iderable Defeat given them, which happened &s;ix days after <HI>Lews</HI> XIV. came to the Throne. And to flu&s;h him with this Succe&s;s, the Colours taken were &s;pread before him at <HI>Paris,</HI> and &s;everal Applau&s;es of Triumph made. And, to &s;ay true, this Victory proved a Check to <HI>Spain,</HI> and gave the <HI>French</HI> Army an Opportunity to enter into their Ter|ritories, and take &s;everal Towns and Fortre&s;&s;es, as <HI>Maubeuge, Borlemont, Aim|merikt, Binch,</HI> and <HI>Thionville,</HI> with o|thers. Yet the &s;mall Ca&s;tle of <HI>Cirke,</HI> &s;topped the Cour&s;e of the <HI>French,</HI> who before rolled on like a Torrent, to the
<PB N="8" REF="8">endangering of all <HI>Flanders.</HI> But they had not the like Succe&s;s in <HI>Germany;</HI> fore there the Mare&s;chal <HI>de Gu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">briant,</HI> General of the <HI>French</HI> Forces, was &s;lain, and his Army wor&s;ted, with the lo&s;s of a great many brave Men, which drew off <HI>Enguin</HI> from <HI>Flanders.</HI> But how|ever, the War cea&s;ed not, for the War with <HI>Spain</HI> engaged mo&s;t of the Princes of <HI>Europe</HI> in the Quarrel. The Trum|pets carried the Noi&s;e of War round the Borders of <HI>Savoy,</HI> as likewi&s;e in <HI>Italy, Navar, Catalonia, Germany, Al&s;atia, Flanders,</HI> and other Places. Nor were the Seas free from Blood; for the Duke of <HI>Breze,</HI> being Admiral for the <HI>French</HI> in the <HI>Straights,</HI> he twice engaged the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Fleet. Nor did this War end without Rivers of Blood, Burnings, Plunderings, and great Deva&s;tations; and then the Mi&s;ery it had occa&s;ioned in <HI>Europe</HI> moved the Princes to &s;end their <HI>Plenepotentiaries</HI> to <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> to compo&s;e the Differences, and agree a general Peace. For the Countries were &s;o wa|&s;ted and Impoveri&s;hed in many Places, that more died by Famine, than the Sword; &s;o that <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. began early to build his a&s;piring Greatne&s;s upon Ruine and De&s;olation, which threat|ned
<PB N="9" REF="8">the World with a turbulent Prince.</P>
<P>To this Treaty, which was ab&s;olute|ly nece&s;&s;ary for the preventing an uni|ver&s;al Famine, the Queen Regent of <HI>France</HI> &s;ent the Count <HI>d' Avaux,</HI> and Mon&s;ieur <HI>Servien,</HI> to manage the Inte|re&s;t of <HI>France;</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Longue|ville</HI> &s;oon after followed them. So that, after many Debates, and the Interpo&s;i|tion of the unintere&s;ted Princes, on the Twenty fourth of <HI>October</HI> 1648. a Peace was concluded, and the Monarchs of <HI>Europe</HI> agreed to lay down their Arms, that Plenty might be re&s;tored by Peace. And this had been done &s;ooner, had not the <HI>French,</HI> according to their accu&s;tom|ed Manner, (even in the mid&s;t of a Treaty, when others depending upon the publick Faith thought them&s;elves &s;ecure,) &s;urprized &s;everal Places, and &s;uddenly brought their Arms into <HI>Ger|many, Lorrain, Flanders, Catalonia,</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> at once; as they did early in the <HI>Spring,</HI> 1645. which &s;o exa&s;perated the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that they requited it before the Peace was concluded, by &s;etting upon the <HI>French</HI> Fleet over again&s;t <HI>Na|ples,</HI> putting it to Flight, with the lo&s;s of a great many Men, and &s;ome Ve&s;&s;els; the Admiral being killed with
<PB N="10" REF="9">a Cannon Bullet, and the Mare&s;chal <HI>de Ga&s;&s;ion,</HI> a great General of <HI>France,</HI> as he laid Siege to <HI>Lens,</HI> was wounded, and being carried to <HI>Arras,</HI> there died; and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> recovered many con&s;i|derable Towns in <HI>Flanders</HI> and other Places, as <HI>Fuens, Courtray,</HI> and <HI>Lens;</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> Army &s;uffered very much. However, the Peace held not in <HI>France;</HI> for the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> with divers o|thers of the Fir&s;t Quality, being grieved that <HI>Mazarine</HI> (once a poor Prie&s;t and of mean Birth) &s;hould play the King of <HI>France,</HI> making his young Pupil, <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. do what he plea&s;ed, Impoveri|&s;hing likewi&s;e the Kingdom, by &s;ending va&s;t Trea&s;ures into <HI>Italy,</HI> to enrich his poor Kindred; in&s;omuch, that his Fa|ther, who had never &s;een &s;uch Summs before, imagined it rained Gold in <HI>France:</HI> The&s;e things, I &s;ay, and the In|&s;olence of that proud Prie&s;t, made them take up Arms to Reform Abu&s;es in the Government, publi&s;hing their <HI>Manife&s;to's</HI> to ju&s;tifie their Proceedings, and remove the <HI>Cardinal</HI> from the Young King. So that the great City of <HI>Paris</HI> declared for them, re&s;olving to defend their Intere&s;t to the utmo&s;t, as did many other Towns. In&s;omuch, that the Crown
<PB N="11" REF="9">was vi&s;ibly at Stake; nor could the <HI>Car|dinal</HI>'s Policy have &s;aved it, had not the Courage and prudent Conduct of the Mare&s;chal <HI>de Turin</HI> put a &s;top to the Progre&s;s of their Arms, whereby he be|came a great In&s;trument of keeping <HI>Lewis the Great</HI> in his Throne, who el&s;e had by this time been Little and In&s;i|gnificant. But in what manner he re|quited him, the Sequel will demon|&s;trate.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> after much Blood-&s;hed in an inte&s;tine War, retrea|ted into <HI>Flanders,</HI> with divers of his Party, who would not leave him, and there was &s;et at the Head of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Forces. Whereupon Ho&s;tilities en&s;ued, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> recovered a great many of the Towns that had been taken from them. So that where Force could not prevail, In&s;inuation and Flattery took place, and at la&s;t the Prince was gained upon to return Home, as did the Dukes of <HI>Conti</HI> and <HI>Longueville,</HI> being highly Care&s;&s;ed; and a Pardon was publi&s;hed to all that had been in the Civil War; and <HI>Lewis,</HI> who hitherto had acted no|thing memorable in his own Per&s;on, being arrived at the Thirteenth Year of his Age, <HI>Anno</HI> 1651, he was declared
<PB N="12" REF="10">to be of &s;ufficient Years to take upon him the Government, and to act in Per&s;on, which Declaration was approved by the <HI>Parliament</HI> of <HI>Paris,</HI> and Proclaimed throughout the Kingdom. Yet the War continued with <HI>Spain,</HI> and many Battels were fought, and Towns lo&s;t and won, things being carried on with various Succe&s;s. So that the King, that he might &s;ay he had been on Hor&s;e-back, got up at the Head of his Troops, to &s;hew him|&s;elf to the People, which did indeed give a little hopes to tho&s;e that were ready to revolt, that things might go better than they had done. But how they were mi&s;taken, will appear in its proper place.</P>
<P>In the Year 1654 great Preparations were made to Crown <HI>Lewis</HI> King of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Navar,</HI> and on the Fourth of <HI>June</HI> the Court arrived at <HI>Rhemes,</HI> and was received by about Two thou&s;and of the Citizens on Hor&s;eback, about a League from that place; to which was made a Guard of about Five thou&s;and of the Inhabitants in Arms, and the Sub|urbs were crouded with the Soldiery. At the Entry were divers Triumphal Arches, beautified with golded Lilies, and many flattering Devices, the Streets
<PB N="13" REF="10">being hung with Tape&s;try, and other Or|naments. And upon his approach the Cannons were thundred off, and volleys of &s;mall Shot di&s;charged; and the Alder|men of the City taking him for &s;ome petty Deity, fell on their Knees, and in that po&s;ture pre&s;ented him the Silver Keys of the Town: And Cardinal <HI>Mazarine</HI> be|ing at the Church of <HI>No&s;trodame</HI> with the Clergy, the King alighted there. The Bi&s;hop of <HI>Soi&s;&s;ons</HI> officiated in the &s;tead of the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Rhemes,</HI> who was a little before dead, the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Cae&s;aria</HI> being his Coadjutor. The Bi|&s;hops of <HI>Noyon</HI> and <HI>Beauvais</HI> attended in their Pontificals, the fir&s;t making an O|ration, in which he gave the King many flattering Epithets, &s;carce due to mor|tal Man. However, knowing that Air of Vanity po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his Mind, that makes him value him&s;elf much upon his own Prai&s;es, nothing was omitted that a Court-para&s;ite could indu&s;triou&s;ly pro|duce. Then the Archdeacon did the like, and the Deacon gave him a <HI>Mi&s;|&s;al</HI> to ki&s;s, who kneeled down upon two Velvet Cu&s;hions, placed on a Foot-cloath under a Canopy of State; and from thence he went unto the Choire to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the <HI>Te Deum,</HI> and the <HI>Ve&s;pers</HI> were performed in Mu&s;ick.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="11">
<P>The <HI>Ve&s;pers</HI> over, he went to the Arch|bi&s;hop's Palace, which was prepared to receive him; and the next day the Co|ronation was Solemnized with great Pomp, the Queen-Mother of <HI>England,</HI> and the Dukes of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI> being pre&s;ent.

<P>And now this &s;pruce young <HI>Mon&s;ieur</HI> being on the Throne, began to make &s;ome Figure in the World, though he &s;till acted by others Heads and Advice. And to give the World a proof of <HI>French</HI> Fidelity, he clapp'd up a Peace, contra|ry to all Mens Expectation, with <HI>Oliver Cromwell,</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Protector, at the time when King <HI>Charles</HI> II. with his two Brothers were at the <HI>French</HI> Court, and had been promi&s;ed, not only Protection, but al&s;o aid to regain the u&s;urped King|doms of <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland, &amp;c.</HI> Nor was this all, but he procee|ded more treacherou&s;ly with his near Kin&s;men; for in the Treaty, among&s;t other things, there was an Article, to
<PB N="15" REF="11">Bani&s;h them <HI>France,</HI> and its Territories. Of which King <HI>Charles</HI> having private Notice, and finding it fruitle&s;s to com|plain where the Royal engagement was &s;o little regarded, to avoid a ceremo|nious Expul&s;ion, with generous di&s;dain he turned his Back upon that ungrateful Court, and with his faithful Followers, as Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> and other Nobles, he retired into <HI>Germany,</HI> and was there re|ceived with all imaginable Joy, and found among&s;t Strangers that Reception, without any promi&s;e or word given, which his Cou&s;in of <HI>France</HI> had &s;o gene|rou&s;ly promi&s;ed, and afterward &s;o ba&s;e|ly denied. But his Brothers, the Dukes of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> &s;tayed behind; the fir&s;t having a Command in the Army, under Mare&s;ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">l <HI>de Turin,</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> But that weighed nothing; for the League being made, he was or|dered to be Packing.

<PB N="16" REF="12">from her Native Country.</HI> This re|&s;olute An&s;wer of the Queen's, made <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. di&s;&s;emble the Matter, and her &s;tay was winked at, though not ap|proved.</P>
<P>Here you may &s;ee <HI>French</HI> Faith to di|&s;tre&s;&s;ed Princes, who though never &s;o near Ally'd to that King, could obtain Refuge no longer than his Intere&s;t mo|ved him to break his Promi&s;es. And this early beginning has been very much improved, as will appear in the Series of this Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The League Offen&s;ive and Defen&s;ive being made with <HI>England</HI> again&s;t <HI>Spain,</HI> Six thou&s;and Men were &s;ent into <HI>Flan|ders,</HI> who beat the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and took <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> whil&s;t the <HI>French,</HI> in a manner, &s;tood &s;till, and looked on.

<P>According to the Treaty, <HI>Dunkirk</HI> was &s;ecured by the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> For the crafty <HI>Protector</HI> not being ignorant of the Fal&s;|hood of the <HI>French</HI> Court, had given &s;ecret Orders to <HI>Lockhart,</HI> who Com|manded in Chief, immediately upon &s;ur|render to enter it, and Po&s;t his Men there, and even to di&s;pute it with the <HI>French,</HI> if it was not quietly put into their Hands. However, though <HI>Ma|zarine</HI> and his Pupil had a great Mind to this &s;trong and important Place, yet at that time they were forced to let it &s;lip through their Fingers, as well knowing the <HI>Protector</HI> had a powerful Army on Foot in <HI>England.</HI> But, &s;ome time after, they found means to Charm it from us with <HI>French</HI> Gold, to the great endama|ging of our Shipping which Trade on that Coa&s;t.</P>
<P>In the Year 1656. the <HI>French</HI> relying upon their own Strength, at the remark|able Siege of <HI>Valenciennes,</HI> received a great Overthrow. But the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had better Succe&s;s; for whil&s;t the <HI>French</HI> &s;tood looking on, and concluded it utter|ly

And indeed, mo&s;t of the Towns that were taken, during this War, may be ju&s;tly a&s;cribed to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Va|lour; which Valour peradventure <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. may one day Experience in the Heart of <HI>France,</HI> as &s;everal of his Predece&s;&s;ors have done.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> grown weary of this War, the u&s;ual way of Accommodation was propo&s;ed, <HI>viz.</HI> a Match between the <HI>Spani&s;h Infanta,</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> King. This Match was greatly oppo&s;ed by <HI>Ma|zarine,</HI> who concluded, if a Peace en&s;u|ed, and the King gave him&s;elf up to the Embraces of a Young Wife, his Autho|rity would be le&s;&s;ened. But the Queen-Mother declared re&s;olutely for it; &s;ay|ing, <HI>That whether he would or no, it &s;hould be done; for that her Son &s;hould marry one of her Kin&s;women.</HI> But this had like to
<PB N="19" REF="13">have broken off by the Sickne&s;s of <HI>Lewis,</HI> which every one concluded would termi|nate in his Death. Whereupon Cardinal <HI>Mazarine</HI> knowing the many Villainies he had committed in <HI>France,</HI> and the Mi&s;|chief done by his Evil Council, was about to pack up his Awls and trudge for <HI>Italy;</HI> fearing, if the King &s;hould die, he &s;hould fall a Sacrifice to the Fury of the Rab|ble. And thereupon he &s;ent a Gentle|man to the Mare&s;chal <HI>de Turin,</HI> to know if he might have a &s;afe Retreat in the Army, till he could otherways &s;hift for him&s;elf. But that Prote&s;tant General re|turned him &s;o cold an An&s;wer, that he was put out of all Hopes. However, whil&s;t he was &s;tudying what to do, the King began to recover; and accordingly e&s;ca|ped that Death that threatned him, to be the cau&s;e of the Death and Ruine of more than a Million of People.</P>
<P>The King being Recovered, <HI>Mazarine</HI> was &s;ent to <HI>Bayon,</HI> and <HI>Don Louis d' Ardo de Gu&s;man</HI> came to Saint <HI>Seba&s;tians,</HI> the more commodiou&s;ly to treat about the Peace, being con&s;tituted for that end <HI>Plenepotentiaries.</HI> And accordingly it was concluded on &s;undry Articles, to the great Joy of the Frontier-Towns, who by Burning, Plundering, Quartering Sol|diers,
<PB N="20" REF="14">and Contributions, were redu|ced to extream Mi&s;ery. And <HI>Lewis</HI> &s;ent a Procurator to <HI>Don Louis d'Ardo,</HI> in his Name to E&s;pou&s;e the <HI>Infanta,</HI> and the Marriage was con&s;ummated at <HI>Fonterabia,</HI> in the pre&s;ence of the Court of <HI>Spain;</HI> and the two Kings met in the <HI>I&s;le of Con|ference,</HI> &s;ituate between both Kingdoms, where <HI>Mary</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> was delivered to <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>France</HI> as his Wife, and both Kings &s;olemnly &s;wore to keep and confirm to one another the Treaty of Peace, and the Young Queen entered <HI>Paris</HI> in an open Chariot, &s;hining with the Trea&s;ure of both the <HI>Indias.</HI> But Card. <HI>Mazarine</HI> for Grief to &s;ee his Purpo&s;e cro&s;&s;ed, as &s;ome gave out, fell &s;ick, and died on the Nine|teenth of <HI>March</HI> 1661. to the Joy of all <HI>France;</HI> to whom he had a long time been a Scourge, and in&s;tilled that Spirit of Cruelty into <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. that has &s;ince been manife&s;ted to the World in Cha|racters of Blood.</P>
<P>This Cardinal had his fir&s;t Ri&s;e under <HI>Richelieu,</HI> the great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ardinal of <HI>France,</HI> and from a mean Birth rai&s;ed him&s;elf and his Family to the greate&s;t Dignity <HI>France</HI> could afford a Subject. He was born an <HI>Itaelian,</HI> and by his cunning bore him&s;elf up in the Favour of this King
<PB N="21" REF="14">and his Father, in &s;pight of all the migh|ty Opponents he met withal. For be|&s;ide the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> Duke of <HI>Conti,</HI> and mo&s;t of the Nobles; he &s;tood the Envy of the People in general, whom he had &s;orely vexed by Taxes and Oppre&s;|&s;ions. The Court went into Mourning for him, but continued it not long; for, an occa&s;ion of Joy &s;oon after made it vani&s;h. The Duke of <HI>Orleance</HI> falling in Love with the beautiful Daughter of <HI>Charles</HI> I. of <HI>England,</HI> the Lady <HI>Henrietta,</HI> at the publick Ceremory of that illu&s;trious Marriage the Mourning went off.</P>
<P>Thus far we have traced this Monarch, as we may term it, in his Leading-&s;trings. For the Cardinal, whil&s;t he lived, had the ab&s;olute Rule of his Mind, what|ever &s;hare he had in his Body; and from thence we may hitherto conclude him an Engine, that moved by the Dictates of that covetous and ambitious Prelate; but for the future we mu&s;t con&s;ider him moving more directly in his own Sphere. It is ob&s;erved of <HI>Nero,</HI> by <HI>Suetonius</HI> and others, That the beginning of his Reign, was tolerable, and not comparable to tho&s;e Cruel and Irregular practices that followed, and left a La&s;ting &s;tain upon him to all Po&s;terity.</P>
<PB N="22" REF="15">
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the terrible Name <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. &s;uppo&s;ed to have gained in the year 1662, his Amba&s;&s;ador contending with the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador for Prece|dency, at the Reception of another Am|ba&s;&s;ador near the <HI>Tower,</HI> was there wor|&s;ted, had &s;everal of his Hor&s;es, and &s;ome of his Attendence killed and wounded. For the King of <HI>England</HI>'s Council not undertaking to determine in this Matter, they were left to di|&s;pute it; and a Proclamation was put out, forbidding any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to meddle in this Matter, upon great Penalties; &s;o that the Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>Lewis the Great</HI> appear'd but very Little, being forced to &s;neak to his Lodging by all the by-Ways he could find, though they pre|tend to claim Precedency of all the Am|ba&s;&s;adors of <HI>Europe</HI> unle&s;s at the Court of <HI>Vienna,</HI> where the Lords of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> bear Rule. Yet this made <HI>Mon&s;ieur</HI> to &s;torm and blu&s;ter at a &s;trange rate, in&s;omuch, that the King of <HI>Spain</HI> being of a quiet di&s;po&s;ition, and not de&s;irous to involve him&s;elf in another War, gave him &s;uch &s;atisfaction as contented him upon his &s;ending complaints to <HI>Madrid,</HI> preferring the Quiet of his Kingdoms be|fore a Punctilio of Honour. Which &s;o
<PB N="23" REF="15">puffed up the <HI>Frenchman,</HI> that he had a great Mind to be Quarrelling with <HI>En|gland;</HI> and not well knowing how to be|gin, he pitched upon a peremptory de|mand of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> that was then in the Hands of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. This De|mand was looked upon by the <HI>French</HI> them&s;elves as &s;o Extravagant, that they could not imagine the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> would hearken to the delivery of a place gain|ed with the lo&s;s of the Lifes of &s;o many brave Men, and extreamly &s;trengthened and fortified, at the Expence of va&s;t Trea&s;ure, lying at the &s;ame time &s;o Commodious for Trade, and other Ad|vantages.</P>
<P>The pretences the <HI>French</HI> King made were, That there was an Agreement with <HI>Oliver Cromwell,</HI> that upon the Pay|ment of a certain Summ of Money, it &s;hould be delivered to the <HI>French.</HI> But no body, as we can hear of, was privy to this Contract but him&s;elf. However, contrary to all Mens Expectation, his <HI>French</HI> Pi&s;tols gained that &s;trong Town, which all the Cannon and Forces of <HI>France,</HI> had the King of <HI>England</HI> de|fended it, could never have done. But now we Experience the damage of that Over&s;ight, when too Late. For <HI>Dun|kirk</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="16">was delivered for Money, and <HI>Lewis</HI> had the unexpected Plea&s;ure of entering into it in Triumph, on the Second of <HI>December,</HI> in the Year 1662.</P>
<P>The&s;e Succe&s;&s;es flu&s;hed his Ambition to greater Attempts, nothing le&s;s now than the <HI>Dukedom</HI> of <HI>Lorrain</HI> will &s;erve his turn, and thereupon he &s;ent his cun|ning Sophi&s;ters to wheedle the Duke out of it by Threats and Promi&s;es. Fir&s;t, That he had an Army ready to fall into it, if it were refu&s;ed. Secondly, That he would con&s;ign him Lands more &s;ecure in Lieu of it in another place. And, to make the old Duke more fond, promi|&s;ed to declare him Heir to the Crown of <HI>France,</HI> in Ca&s;e the Family of <HI>Bourbon</HI> failed, although there was a <HI>Dauphin</HI> born of the young Queen. The&s;e, and other inveiglings between Force and fair Means, wrought &s;o powerfully, that the Agreement was made the Sixth of <HI>Febru|ary</HI> 1662. and in <HI>March</HI> following con|firmed in the <HI>Parliament</HI> of <HI>Paris,</HI> to the apparent Wrong of Prince <HI>Charles,</HI> the pre&s;ent Duke of <HI>Lorrain;</HI> who, though of years, was no ways con&s;enting to his Father's Act. And upon this Agreement, the <HI>French</HI> Troops were immediately &s;ent, who &s;eized upon all the Cities and
<PB N="25" REF="16">Country of that fertil and &s;pacious <HI>Duke|dom,</HI> except <HI>Mar&s;al,</HI> which being gari|&s;oned and influenced by the young Prince, oppo&s;ed their Progre&s;s. This made <HI>Mon&s;ieur</HI> &s;torm and immediately he or|dered his <HI>Generals</HI> to be ready for an Ex|pedition, to make War, as he term'd it, for the Glory of his Arms; and came on &s;o terribly in the Head of his Forces, that the old Duke, though he repented of what he had done, fore&s;eeing the ru|ine that would in&s;ue to his People if he oppo&s;ed, and being altogether unfur|ni&s;hed, by the &s;urprize of his Towns, to Encounter a great Army, thought it his be&s;t way to &s;ubmit to his Misfortune. And thereupon, in an humble manner he went to <HI>Metz</HI> in <HI>Lorrain</HI> to excu&s;e him&s;elf to <HI>Lewis,</HI> who received the vene|rable old Man after a haughty manner, and would hear of nothing but the &s;ur|render of <HI>Mar&s;al;</HI> which not being a|ble to hold out again&s;t &s;uch a powerful Army, as he had brought into the Coun|try, it was put into <HI>French</HI> hands on the Third of <HI>September</HI> 1663.</P>
<P>Much about this time, <HI>Lewis</HI> fell a ca|velling, like an Unchri&s;tian Son, with his <HI>Holy Father</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> and the Manner was thus. <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Crequi,</HI> his Am|ba&s;&s;ador
<PB N="26" REF="17">in that City, bearing him&s;elf with too high a hand, and putting A|bu&s;es even upon the <HI>Pope</HI> him&s;elf, it &s;o enraged &s;ome of the <HI>Pope</HI>'s Guards, that (whether willingly, or by chance, remains doubtful) a <HI>Harquibus</HI> was &s;hot into his Coach, which wounded &s;ome of his Ser|vants. This Affront made &s;uch a noi&s;e in the Court of <HI>France,</HI> that <HI>Lewis,</HI> in|&s;tead of going in Devotion, immedi|ately prepared to make a Proce&s;&s;ion to <HI>Rome</HI> with his Dragoons, which &s;o frighted Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> II. that then held the Chair, that he was forced to &s;end and meet his Army with Prote|&s;tation of his Trouble for what had hap|pened, and that he &s;hould have any &s;a|tisfaction. This &s;topped his Carier a little, and <HI>Pi&s;a</HI> was pitched upon as the City to examine the matter. And on the Twelfth of <HI>March</HI> 1664. it was agreed between the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Pope</HI>'s Deputies, (a thing that the Pride of the <HI>Popes</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI> never &s;ubmitted to for ma|ny Hundred years;) <HI>viz,</HI> that <HI>Flavio Chigi,</HI> the <HI>Pope</HI>'s Nephew, &s;hould come to the King, and beg the <HI>Pope</HI>'s Par|don, (&s;o that it &s;eems, the <HI>Great Par|doner</HI> was forced to creep at this Time for a pardon from one of his Sons.)
<PB N="27" REF="17">And farther, That a Monument &s;hould be rai&s;ed in the place where the Affront was done, with an In&s;cription, decla|ring the Cau&s;e of its being erected.

But &s;oon after, the Queen-Mother of <HI>France</HI> died; and now <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. began to take his plea&s;ure without Regard to the young Queen.

<PB N="28" REF="18">And although the Queen grew jealous, and the Queen-Mother very much reproved his over-fondne&s;s of this Woman, yet he little regarded their Reproaches.

<P>But to cut off this Digre&s;&s;ion, if it may properly be &s;o termed, as to what is con&s;i&s;tent to Hi&s;tory of this Nature, we find that <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. was not &s;atisfied with having <HI>Dunkirk</HI> delivered to him;
<PB N="32" REF="20">but dreading the Growing Greatne&s;s of his <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Neighbours, <HI>viz. England,</HI> and the <HI>&V;nited Provinces,</HI> by &s;ome extra|ordinary Contrivance they were &s;et toge|ther by the Ears, and engaged in an Un|happy War, occa&s;ioning much blood|&s;hed on either Part, whil&s;t <HI>France</HI> was a looker on. But when that Court per|ceived the <HI>Dutch</HI> inclined to a Peace, as being wearied with an Expen&s;ive and hazardous War; then, and not till then, the <HI>French</HI> put in to a&s;&s;i&s;t the <HI>States,</HI> to keep the flame &s;till blazing; that &s;o the two mo&s;t powerful Nations at Sea under Heaven, might weaken each other, and thereby lay them&s;elves more open and expo&s;ed to the Projects of <HI>France,</HI> which has but too apparently been manife&s;ted. For, although in the Year 1666. the <HI>French</HI> Fleet was abroad, yet it was on|ly in a bravado; for we could never learn from any hand, That that Fleet (though the Ships carried many terrible Names, as <HI>Tempe&s;t, Lightning, Thunder,</HI> &amp;c.) effected any thing; but rather &s;tood as a looker on, whil&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> battered each other; though at the &s;ame time they might have come up, the Wind being favourable. Nor were the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> better &s;erved when they
<PB N="33" REF="20">were on their part, as will hereafter ap|pear: So that if there was not (as let tho&s;e believe who are very credulous, if they plea&s;e,) a de&s;ign in it for the weakning the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Intere&s;t; at lea&s;t we may conclude, That this produced nothing as to the Reputation of making War, for the Glory of the Arms of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. However, after &s;everal Fights, and much Blood-&s;hed, though little or none of the <HI>French</HI> in the&s;e Acti|ons, upon more deliberate Con&s;iderati|ons, a Peace was concluded in 1668. Yet in this Interim, there are other Re|marks than what we have mentioned.</P>
<P>The <HI>French,</HI> during this <HI>Naval</HI> War, had not the Courage to make any de|&s;cent upon <HI>England,</HI> or any of the Three Kingdoms; but upon our People in the <HI>We&s;t-Indias</HI> their Treachery appeared in a Crim&s;on dye, e&s;pecially in the I&s;land of St. <HI>Chri&s;tophers;</HI> where the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> as planters of that I&s;land, had lived together in neighbourly Love, as every one thought, for many years, re|ciprocally and with much &s;atisfaction enjoying the Fruits of their Labour. But upon Notice of this War, and the iu&s;tigation of <HI>French</HI> Popi&s;h Cruelty, they fell unawares upon the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and
<PB N="34" REF="21">Ma&s;&s;acred them without mercy, or &s;o much as giving them time to think of a future State, &s;eizing upon their Goods and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, to the eternal Infamy of the <HI>French</HI> Nation. They likewi&s;e &s;ei|zed upon the I&s;lands of <HI>Antigo,</HI> Saint <HI>Eu|&s;tach,</HI> and <HI>Tobago.</HI> Yet all this while the Court of <HI>France</HI> pretended they had no Quarrel again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> but what they did was in the defence of their Al|lies, pretending a great Kindne&s;s for the <HI>Dutch;</HI> who &s;ince have experienced it to their no &s;mall Detriment, which however may in time be repay'd. How the <HI>Port</HI> at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> Court have hitherto taken equal Mea|&s;ures, never ob&s;erving any Obligation longer than it tended to their Intere&s;t, we leave the World to judge.</P>
<P>This was not all the de&s;ign of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. for by embroiling <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> he had lei&s;ure (notwith&s;tand|ing the Peace &s;olemnly &s;worn to, and concluded with the King of <HI>Spain</HI>) to enter <HI>Flanders,</HI> under Pretence of &s;ome Particulars not performed, relating to the Contract of Marriage with the <HI>In|fanta.</HI> Nor could his Queen per&s;uade him to rea&s;on, but in <HI>May</HI> 1667. he entered <HI>Flanders</HI> with an Army of 30000.
<PB N="35" REF="21">Hor&s;e and Foot; upon which unexpe|cted &s;urprize, many of the Garri&s;ons drew off, as <HI>Armantiers, Laba&s;&s;ee, Conde, Bergues, S. Guilhain,</HI> and <HI>Furves;</HI> of which the Mare&s;chal <HI>d' Aumont</HI> took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. And the better to &s;ecure the Frontiers, <HI>Lewis</HI> commanded <HI>Charleroy</HI> to be Rebuilt and Fortified. Many o|ther Towns of Note were taken, being rather got by &s;urprize than by true Va|lour on the part of the <HI>Franch:</HI> For many of them, in this &s;ecurity, were unprovided of many things that might have contributed to a longer Defence, or &s;ecured them from falling into the Hands of the Invader. <HI>Lille</HI> was the only Place that made a re&s;olute Defence; for in this place was a Governour of great Repute, under who&s;e Command was a Garri&s;on of 4000 Foot, and 800 Hor&s;e: Nor was it gained but by a bloo|dy Siege, when the Governour found all hopes of expecting Relief vain, through the want of timely Notice of the <HI>French</HI> King's Intentions to Invade tho&s;e Pro|vinces, or the unpreparedne&s;s of the Court of <HI>Spain</HI> to &s;end an Army to op|po&s;e the Torrent of a <HI>French</HI> Power, ad|vantageou&s;ly poured into tho&s;e Coun|tries. The Town Surrendered upon
<PB N="36" REF="22">Articles on the 28. of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> and <HI>Lewis,</HI> who then was in the Army, entered into it. Notwith&s;tanding, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> during the Siege made &s;ome Attempts to Relieve it, but, their Forces being &s;mall, they were fru&s;trated.</P>
<P>In the Year 1668. for the Glory of his Arms, <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. thought of ano|ther Enterprize, which was, to take into his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by Force the <HI>French Comte,</HI> which, as a kind of a <HI>Palatinate,</HI> or &s;eparate <HI>Principality,</HI> had enjoyed many Privileges and Immunities; which being altogether unarmed or capable of Defence upon &s;uch a Surprize, the In|habitants were forced to &s;end to the King's Deputies to treat of Yielding; thereby to prevent the Spoils and Ra|vage of a Hunger &s;tarved Army. How|ever, in the mid&s;t of the Treaty, <HI>Be|&s;an&s;on</HI> was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by a forced Surren|der on the Sixth of <HI>February. Salines</HI> was al&s;o Surprized; and many other places not being &s;ufficiently Garri&s;oned, or provided with Stores, were obliged to their Gates. <HI>Dole</HI> only was capable of making a &s;hew of Re&s;i&s;tence; but the <HI>French</HI> Army being numerous, and &s;ud|denly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them&s;elves of the Out|works, they were forced to accept of
<PB N="37" REF="22">&s;uch Terms as were offered by the <HI>French</HI> King, and thereupon they &s;ent him the Keys of the City.</P>
<P>It may be gue&s;&s;ed what little Expecta|tion this Country had of a <HI>French</HI> Army, when in the &s;pace of Twelve Days &s;o many &s;trong Places Yeilded, that were capable of holding out many Years, had they had timely Notice, and well pro|vided. But it has ever been ob&s;ervable, that this King gains mo&s;t of his Advan|tages by this way, or the force of golden Pi&s;tols, charged into the Governours Pockets.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> King perceiving that the <HI>Dutch</HI> (weary of his Alliance, who had done &s;o little for them, and pretended &s;o much,) were inclined to make a Peace, and join with the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and thinking he had gained &s;ufficiently, if he could keep what he had got, Overtures of Peace where thereupon propo&s;ed, and <HI>Mon|&s;ieur Colbert</HI> was &s;ent to <HI>Aix la Chapelle</HI> to meet the Mini&s;ters of the Mediating Princes. And accordingly the Articles of Peace between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> were &s;igned on the Sixth of <HI>May,</HI> and made Publick at <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Bru&s;&s;els.</HI> Yet <HI>Lew|is</HI> was not well plea&s;ed to be fru&s;trated in his Expectation of &s;wallowing the
<PB N="38" REF="23"><HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Provinces, attributing his di&s;ap|pointment to the <HI>Dutch;</HI> who declaring for the Intere&s;t of <HI>Spain,</HI> had obliged him to this Peace. But his Threats were retarded by another Enterprize. It &s;o happened, that the <HI>Turks,</HI> with a nu|rous Army, had be&s;ieged the City of <HI>Candia,</HI> &s;ituate in the I&s;land formerly called <HI>Creet,</HI> belonging to the <HI>Venetians:</HI> So that may of the <HI>French</HI> Nobility, who had prepared their Equipages for the en&s;uing Compaign, and being prevented by the Peace the <HI>French</HI> King was forced to comply withal, went thither, and upon their Return gave an account of the place. In&s;omuch that <HI>Lewis</HI> think|ing to have the Honour of relieving that Bulwork of <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> which had held out a long, doubtful, and bloody Siege, and upon the Event of which the Eyes of all <HI>Europe</HI> were fixed, &s;ent an Army of <HI>French</HI> men, under the Command of the Dukes of <HI>Beaufort</HI> and <HI>Navailles,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of 10000 Men; who, with|out any detriment, entered that City, which was laid almo&s;t in Ruines with the Bombs &s;hot in by the <HI>Infidels.</HI> Where|upon, it was concluded in a Council of War, that it could be no longer tena|ble without performing &s;ome extraor|dinary
<PB N="39" REF="23">Exploit; and after a farther-Con&s;ult, it was agreed, That a vigo|rous Sally &s;hould be made, in Order to the rai&s;ing of the Siege.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> indeed were very forward; and, to give the Duke of <HI>Beaufort</HI> his Due, he behaved him&s;elf like a man of good Courage and Conduct. The Sally was accordingly made, with great Re|&s;olution, and the <HI>Turks</HI> at fir&s;t were beaten out of their Trenches: But the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them&s;elves of a Ma|gazine of Three hundred Barrels and Sacks of Powder; whether by Matches laid on purpo&s;e by the Enemy, or fired by chance, it blew up and de&s;troyed al|mo&s;t one whole Regiment, in which it was thought the Duke of <HI>Beaufort</HI> was killed, and buried by the overthrowing of the Earth; for his Body was not af|terwards found. Which terrible thun|dercrack &s;o di&s;mayed the <HI>French</HI>-men, who were the foremo&s;t in the Sally, that they retired in great confu&s;ion, think|ing by the Earthquake it made, that all the Ground was hollow, and charged with Mines. So that the <HI>Turks</HI> Rallying, and being reinforced with great Num|bers that came pouring from the Hills, the Belieged were driven into the City,
<PB N="40" REF="24">and the <HI>French</HI> never after that could be per&s;uaded to make any other Sally, or &s;o much as to &s;tay for the Defence of the Place, although the Governour almo&s;t with Tears be&s;ought it. But the Duke of <HI>Novailles,</HI> who now Command|ed in Chief, pretending Orders from his Ma&s;ter, took Shipping, and with tho&s;e Forces he had left, returned to <HI>France;</HI> which was not for the Glory of the King's Arms. For, had they &s;tayed, and done what became Soldiers, that famous City had undoubtedly been &s;aved, which by this Defeat, was in a &s;hort time after delivered to the <HI>Turks,</HI> with whom <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. has &s;ince had a better Cor|re&s;pondence; as will appear in due Place and Order.</P>
<P>In the year 1669. the Duke of <HI>Lor|rain,</HI> grieved that he had &s;o ea&s;ily par|ted with his Countries, hoping it was not yet too late to retract, he required Aid of the <HI>Emperor,</HI> and King of <HI>Spain,</HI> labouring to engage them again&s;t <HI>France.</HI> Whereupon <HI>Lewis</HI> &s;ent the <HI>Mare&s;chal de Crequi</HI> with an Army of 18000 Men in|to his Country, who di&s;mantled and pulled down the Walls of divers Towns, making great Ravagement, though he found little or no oppo&s;ition. For on|ly
<PB N="41" REF="24">the little Towns of <HI>Epinal</HI> and <HI>Chate</HI> made &s;ome &s;hew of a Re&s;i&s;tence. But there being no Army that could promi&s;e them Relief, they were compelled to &s;ur|render, and the old Duke to fly his Pa|trimonial Country, and foregoe tho&s;e va&s;t Promi&s;es the <HI>French</HI> Court had made him. The Eyes of all <HI>Europe</HI> being up|on this unfair dealing, and greatly Re|gretting it; to keep the Inhabitants qui|et, he ordered they &s;hould be treated with &s;omewhat more Mildne&s;s than is u&s;ually ob&s;erved in the <HI>French</HI> Conque&s;ts, (as they term them, though for the mo&s;t part got by Surprize or Treachery.) And finding the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were no way &s;atisfied with his proceedings, (for he had infringed upon their Commerce,) he re&s;olved to begin fir&s;t; and having vi&s;ited and &s;trengthened his Towns in <HI>Flanders,</HI> and upon the Frontiers, he by a &s;ubtil Negotiation (as &s;ome Hi&s;tori|ans will have it) of <HI>Henrietta,</HI> Duche&s;s of <HI>Orleance,</HI> who had an Interview with her Royal Brothers at <HI>Dover,</HI> drew the King of <HI>England</HI> into an Expen&s;ive War again&s;t the States. But whether by the means of that Prince&s;s, who died upon her return into <HI>France,</HI> or otherwi&s;e, we determine not. However, it is cer|tain
<PB N="42" REF="25">that great Naval Preparations were made before it was publickly known to what Intent.</P>
<P>The Duche&s;s of <HI>Orleance</HI> dying &s;ud|denly, and not without Su&s;picion of e|vil Practice; the Duke, by the per&s;ua|&s;ion of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. was Married to the Daughter of the Prince <HI>Palatine</HI> of the <HI>Rhine.</HI> Upon which Country no doubt (and it &s;ince has but too plainly appear|ed) he had an Eye.</P>
<P>In the Year 1672, on the 7^t^h of <HI>April,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> King's Declaration was put forth, prohibiting all Trade and Com|merce with the <HI>States</HI> of the <HI>&V;nited Pro|vinces.</HI> And, out of a Bravado, he mar|ched in per&s;on at the Head of an Army of 150000 Men. By which &s;urprizing Inva&s;ion, he like a Torrent carried all before him. So that many looked upon the <HI>Low Countries</HI> to be lo&s;t, if no &s;peedy Stop was put to this Progre&s;s. But it has always been ob&s;erved, that though the fir&s;t Motions of the <HI>French</HI> are impe|tuous, yet the lea&s;t di&s;couragement makes them Recoil. They had on a &s;udden filled with their Troops the <HI>Duchy</HI> of <HI>Cleves,</HI> the <HI>Electorate</HI> of <HI>Collen,</HI> the <HI>Duchy</HI> of <HI>Limburg,</HI> the County of <HI>Zutphen, &V;treitcht,</HI> and its Territories,
<PB N="43" REF="25">with many other places, and got into their hands &s;everal &s;trong Towns; and into this Combination the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> of <HI>Mun|&s;ter</HI> was drawn, who took <HI>Groll</HI> and &s;ome other places, though not very con|&s;iderable. They pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Rhine</HI> like|wi&s;e, and did con&s;iderable damages in &s;uch places as were found unprovided, Committing great Outrages. Which &s;o puffed up <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. that being return|ed to <HI>Paris,</HI> he was congratulated with Flatteries and Applau&s;es from all the So|cieties of the Kingdom. And in Imi|tation of the Heathen Idolaters, the Queen cau&s;ed a Chapel to be built at <HI>Roan,</HI> dedicated to our <HI>Lady of Victories.</HI> The King was &s;tyled <HI>the invincible Hero,</HI> though he was always &s;o tender of him|&s;elf, that he neither engaged in any Bat|tel or Skirmi&s;h, or &s;eldom came within Cannon &s;hot of any place that re&s;i&s;ted, doing what be&s;t &s;uited his Valour, which has not overmuch of the <HI>Hero</HI> in it. But indeed the Progre&s;s of his Arms had a Recoil: for the <HI>Provinces</HI> being reco|vered out of the Amaze this &s;udden At|tempt put them into, and the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> (now King of <HI>England</HI>) con|firmed in his Patrimonial Offices, and honourable Tru&s;ts, as <HI>Stadtholder, Ad|miral,</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="26">and <HI>General</HI> of the <HI>&V;nited Provinces;</HI> he pre&s;ently took the Field with an Ar|my of 24000 Men, recovering &s;everal places, and cau&s;ing the <HI>French</HI> to retire, and performing many other Exploits worthy him&s;elf, and the Glory of his An|ce&s;tors. But having taken a view of the <HI>French</HI> King's Affairs hitherto at Land, let us ca&s;t our Eyes a little upon the Ocean</P>
<P>The <HI>Fleets</HI> being Abroad in <HI>May</HI> 1672. on the 28^t^h of that Month a &s;harp In|gagement en&s;ued, the then Duke of <HI>York</HI> commanding as Admiral. It continued a long time bloody and doubtful, du|ring which many brave Men were lo&s;t, as the Earl of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> &amp;c. who would not leave his Ship, though all in Flames, till it was too late to &s;uccour him. His Body was found &s;loating, and afterward honourably buried; but we cannot learn that the <HI>French</HI> did any thing con&s;idera|ble in this Action, or that any more than their Reer-Admiral, <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Rabi|niere Trees les Bois,</HI> came up to a clo&s;e Fight; who behaving him&s;elf like a man of Courage was &s;lain, and afterward honourably Interred at <HI>Rochel;</HI> the re&s;t lying off in a Line and firing at a Di|&s;tance, and many times greatly enda|maging
<PB N="45" REF="26">the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> e&s;pecially in their Rig|ging, though they perceived only the <HI>Blue</HI> Squadron Engaged, the <HI>Red</HI> not being able to come up in time. So the <HI>French</HI> &s;tood rather Neuters, or Lookers on, than any ways concerned in the Battel.</P>
<P>From this there grew a &s;u&s;picion, that they had Orders to keep from Engaging as much as po&s;&s;ible, that the two Fleets of <HI>England</HI> and the <HI>&V;nited Provinces</HI> might batter each other, that through their weakne&s;s the <HI>French</HI> King might become &s;trong at Sea; which more vi&s;ibly ap|peared the following Year, 1673.</P>
<P>This Year the Valiant Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> Commanded the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet, where the <HI>French</HI> joining him, he made One hundred and twenty Sail of &s;tout Ships. The <HI>Dutch</HI> were Commanded by <HI>Du Ruytter</HI> and <HI>Van Trump;</HI> &s;o that a &s;harp Engagement happened. But the <HI>French</HI> no &s;ooner heard the Bullets begin to rat|tle, and &s;aw with what Fury and Vio|lence the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Engaged, but almo&s;t all that Fleet &s;tood away, pretending to gain the Weather-gage, the which, when they had very favou|rably got, they e'en kept it for the Glo|ry of their Ma&s;ter's Arms; for they ne|ver came up again during the Fight.
<PB N="46" REF="27">And tho&s;e few Captains, that had &s;o much Sen&s;e of Honour, as not to follow their Admiral, (who were but very few,) had &s;ecret Intimation that they were in danger of being hanged, when they came into <HI>France,</HI> for not following their Flag, or Orders. But how they came off, has not yet occurred.</P>
<P>The Prince, though he made good the Fight, and came off with Honour and Bravery, &s;tormed to be thus de&s;erted. Whereupon, when the <HI>French</HI> Admiral came on board him to make his Excu&s;e (which proved but a very lame one) the Prince is reported to look upon him with Indignation, and after reproaching him with Ba&s;ene&s;s, told the <HI>Mon&s;ieur,</HI> That had he been one of his Ma&s;ter, the King of <HI>England</HI>'s Subjects, he would have killed him with his own Hand.</P>
<P>And to let the World &s;ee how much the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Valour &s;urpa&s;&s;es that of the <HI>French,</HI> and how much <HI>Lewis</HI> is be|holden to it for his Greatne&s;s, I need in&s;tance but one Particular, <HI>viz.</HI> During this War the &s;trong City of <HI>Ma&s;treicht</HI> was be&s;ieged by an Army of about Forty Thou&s;and, and the King came as near as he dur&s;t venture, that his Men might be the better encouraged. It was in|ve&s;ted
<PB N="47" REF="27">on the Sixth of <HI>June,</HI> and there was in it a Garri&s;on of 7 or 8000 Men, one <HI>Faro,</HI> a Valiant Man, being Gover|nour. The be&s;ieged made a &s;tout re|&s;i&s;tence, and many were killed on both Sides; in&s;omuch that the <HI>French</HI> began to &s;aint. At what time the Heroick Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> who was at the Head of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> in the height of Youthful Valour, de&s;pi&s;ing Danger, went on to the A&s;&s;ault through Showers of &s;mall and great Shot; and Commanding in the Trenches, though Two or Three Mines were &s;prung to ob&s;truct his Pa&s;|&s;age, he and the few that followed him, charged with &s;uch re&s;olution, that they carried the <HI>Half-Moon,</HI> contrary to the Expectation of all Men, in le&s;s than half an Hour; though the Shot flew round him as thick as Hail, maintaining it till he had delivered it to a <HI>French</HI> Collonel, who was &s;ent to relieve him. But no &s;ooner was the Duke and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> re|tired, but the <HI>French,</HI> though &s;trongly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, not being able to endure the fire of the Be&s;ieged, quitted it. This vexed the Duke to &s;ee that a Regi|ment could not keep, when put into their hands, what him&s;elf and a very few <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had got. In&s;omuch, that he
<PB N="48" REF="28">prepared to regain it, which he did with &s;uch daring Re&s;olution, that, ac|companied only by Twelve Voluntier-Gentlemen, he threw him&s;elf over the Works and Trenches, with his Weapon in his Hand, and beat out the Defen|dents, gaining the <HI>Half-Moon</HI> a &s;econd time, and delivered it <HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Feuvilade,</HI> whom then &s;hame more than true Valour compelled to &s;ecure it. And indeed, it is conjectured by many, that this &s;trong Place had put a &s;top to the <HI>French</HI> Arms, had not the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who bore all the brunt of the Siege, done things to a wonder; &s;o that at la&s;t it &s;urrendered upon honourable Conditions on the Thirteenth of <HI>June.</HI> But the <HI>French</HI> fury, like a blazing Comet, ha|ving by this time &s;pent it &s;elf, and the Confederate Armies gathering like a black Tempe&s;t around them, <HI>Lewis</HI> found that this had been but a kind of a Frolick, to make him more known. For he was not capable of Garri&s;oning the Towns he had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and keep an Army in the Field, which made him &s;pue them up as fa&s;t as he had &s;wallowed them; withdrawing his Garri&s;ons, and Abandoning them to their true Owners. which occa&s;ioned a Comical Portraicture
<PB N="49" REF="28">of <HI>Lewis the Great,</HI> Spewing and Sh&mdash;ing Towns and Ca&s;tles. However, upon leaving tho&s;e places, many of them were di&s;mantled, and the Inhabitants obliged to part with almo&s;t all they had, for their Contribution or Ran&s;om, at the di&s;cretion of the Soldiers.</P>
<P>King <HI>Charles</HI> II. of <HI>England,</HI> by this time grown weary of a War, into which he had been unadvi&s;edly drawn, and the which without any advantage to <HI>Eng|land,</HI> had co&s;t a great deal of Blood and Trea&s;ure, whil&s;t the <HI>French</HI> reaped the Profit; a Peace was concluded with the <HI>States</HI> for him&s;elf on very honourable Terms. So that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet being laid up, the <HI>French</HI> dur&s;t be little at Sea; yet at Land the War continued, where the <HI>French</HI> Gold did the greater Service, as indeed it has all along had the Luck to do. And in this State things continued, till the beginning of <HI>May,</HI> 1674.</P>
<P><HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. finding he had ingaged him&s;elf too far, and that his violent Pro|ceedings had drawn a great many Princes upon him, (for they found it high time to Confederate again&s;t the Di&s;turber of Chri&s;tendom,) &s;ome Overtures of Peace were made, and a Treaty &s;et on Foot
<PB N="50" REF="29">in the City of <HI>Cologne,</HI> where divers were a&s;&s;embled, in hopes of bringing it to Perfection. But upon the Emperor's &s;eizing of the Prince of <HI>Fur&s;temburg,</HI> (who worked the <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;t, tho' a Subject of the Empire, and ought to have done the contrary,) it greatly di&s;|gu&s;ted the <HI>French</HI> King, and proved a <HI>Remora</HI> to this Treaty. So that Ho&s;ti|lities continued, and the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> &s;eized on <HI>Navaigne;</HI> which, after a &s;hort Siege was delivered up; and the King him&s;elf laid Siege to <HI>Dole,</HI> which made a &s;tout re&s;i&s;tence, and killed him a great many Men. But not being timely &s;uc|coured, it at la&s;t fell into their Hands.</P>

<DIV2 N="50-100" TYPE="pages">
<P>The&s;e proceedings made the Confe|derate Armies draw together to oppo&s;e them; &s;o that on the Fifteenth of <HI>June,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and the Count of <HI>Caprara,</HI> gave <HI>Turin</HI> Battel; but want|ing Foot, as having but One Regi|ment of Foot to Seven thou&s;and Hor&s;e, and hourly Expecting the Duke of <HI>Bournonville,</HI> who was coming towards them, the <HI>French</HI> on the other hand being Twelve thou&s;and &s;trong, not|with&s;tanding a de&s;perate Fight, they were forced to retire over the <HI>Necker,</HI> many brave Men being killed, and di|vers
<PB N="51" REF="29">taken Pri&s;oners. The lo&s;s of the &s;lain are held to be equal; and had not the Duke wanted Foot, the <HI>French</HI> had been utterly routed: For he Charged with &s;uch Fury and Re&s;olution, at the Head of his Troops, as if he had been weary of his Life, and expected a <HI>Duke|dom</HI> in another World, rather than this.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e things pa&s;&s;ed, the <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;coured the Seas with their Fleet, the <HI>French</HI> not daring to peep abroad; for now they had nothing to fear on the Ocean, having made a Peace with the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> Whereupon they braved the <HI>French</HI> in their Harbours, and made a De&s;cent on <HI>Bell I&s;le,</HI> but could make no Advantage on that &s;trong Place. But the <HI>Dutch</HI> Forces at Land took the <HI>Grime,</HI> a very &s;trong Place, after a hard Siege. And now <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. betook him to the <HI>French</HI> Policy, of tampering abroad: And finding by his Agents, that the In|habitants of <HI>Me&s;&s;ina</HI> in <HI>Sicily,</HI> grew wea|ry of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Government, he en|couraged them to Rebel, and &s;ent them Succours under the Command of the Duke <HI>de Vivone;</HI> &s;eizing that City, and taking an Oath of Fidelity of the Inhabi|tants. But when he had brought them to this Revolt, and kept a Garri&s;on there a
<PB N="52" REF="30">very con&s;iderable Time, contrary to the Expection of all Men, and out of what Caprice none perhaps but him&s;elf knows to this Day, he &s;uddenly recal|led his Forces, leaving &s;o many of the Inhabitants, as would not leave all they had to Ship them&s;elves and fly into <HI>France,</HI> (where they could rely upon no Succour,) to the Mercy of the Inraged <HI>Spaniards,</HI> whom they had highly of|fended by this Revolt. Nor had they above four Hours Notice: Yet as many as could, crowded on Board, and after|ward lived in Exile, not daring to re|turn.</P>
<P>King <HI>Charles</HI> II. of <HI>England</HI> having made a Peace with the <HI>States</HI> of the <HI>&V;ni|ted Provinces,</HI> i&s;&s;ued out a Proclamation on the Nineteenth of <HI>May,</HI> 1675. com|manding all his Subjects in the <HI>French</HI> Service as Soldiers, &s;ince the Treaty of Peace, to quit forthwith that Service, and return Home; and prohibiting any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>-men to engage them&s;elves in the like for the future; which proved a great Detriment to the Progre&s;s of the <HI>French</HI> Arms, as &s;oon after appeared: For the Army as not only overthrown, but <HI>Turin,</HI> the mo&s;t Experienced General of <HI>France,</HI> was &s;lain. But, becau&s;e this
<PB N="53" REF="30">Action was very Memorable, we &s;hall not think it ami&s;s to give a brief Account of it.</P>
<P>On the Eighteenth of <HI>July</HI> 1675, the <HI>Mare&s;chal de Turin</HI> commanded out the Regiments of Hor&s;e of <HI>Campaigne</HI> and <HI>Orleance,</HI> with Nine Squadron of Hor&s;e, under the Command of the Marque&s;s <HI>de Rone, Mare&s;chal,</HI> to pa&s;s the River <HI>Ren|chau,</HI> by the Means of Two Bridges he had laid over. And being informed, That the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> had laid an Ambu|&s;cade on the other &s;ide, he went in per|&s;on to &s;ee if he could di&s;cover it from a certain Height, near the Bridge: When the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts,</HI> having planted Two &s;mall Pieces in a Wood hard by, fired one of them without any con&s;iderable Execu|tion; but the &s;ecoud being Charged with Iron, or Cartridge-&s;hot, put a period to <HI>Turin</HI>'s Life; killing likewi&s;e, the Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance, and divers others of Quality about him; though &s;ome Accounts &s;ay, he was killed with a Cannon Shot. However, thus ended that great General, who had been brought up in War, as we may proper|ly term it, from his Infancy, and &s;een many Rivers of Blood; who&s;e Death gave a great check to the <HI>French</HI> Affairs,
<PB N="54" REF="31">and the Army was &s;o much di&s;couraged, that it immediately retired in &s;ome di&s;|order; when being pur&s;ued, and hotly engaged by <HI>Montecuculi,</HI> the <HI>Imperial</HI> General, between Six and Seven thou|&s;and of them were &s;lain, and &s;everal Colours, with &s;ome Cannon and Bag|gage taken; the Count <HI>de Lorge,</HI> who Commanded after the Death of <HI>Turin,</HI> being wounded, and many Per&s;ons of Quality killed.</P>
<P>This was &s;econded by the Overthrow of the <HI>Mare&s;chal de Crequi,</HI> near <HI>Treves:</HI> For the <HI>Confederates</HI> having be&s;ieged that place, which had been &s;urprized by the <HI>French,</HI> the <HI>Mare&s;chal</HI> came to Succour it; but the Be&s;iegers drawing off, and giving him Battel, his Forces were totally defeated, with the lo&s;s of Three or Four thou&s;and Men, and of all the Baggage and Cannon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the bro|ken Army &s;cattering, and getting into the adjacent Town. The <HI>Mare&s;chal</HI> with &s;ive or &s;ix men got into <HI>Treves,</HI> and, the Governour being killed, took upon him to defend the place; but the Be&s;iegers having made Three Breaches &s;o wide, that Forty Men a-brea&s;t might enter; the Officers finding the Ditches likewi&s;e filled up, and the Storm ready to be
<PB N="55" REF="31">made, they Capitulated without <HI>Crequi;</HI> who, to regain in &s;ome mea&s;ure the Credit he had lo&s;t, &s;uffered him&s;elf to be made a Pri&s;oner of War. <HI>Binch</HI> was likewi&s;e taken by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and many other Advantages gained. So that <HI>Lewis the Great,</HI> began to think that he had over&s;tood his Markets, and thought it high time to look out for Confederates. Whereupon he drew the King of <HI>Sweeden</HI> into an Alliance with him, to divert the War on that &s;ide of the King of <HI>Den|mark</HI> and Duke of <HI>Brandenburg.</HI> But the <HI>Sweeds</HI> had but little Succe&s;s in his Quar|rel, as being wor&s;ted by Land and Sea, and having nothing but the <HI>French</HI> King's Word for Reparation. In&s;omuch that they were obliged to &s;it down by the Lo&s;s, and thereupon <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. began to tamper with the <HI>States</HI> of <HI>Holland,</HI> to clap up a Peace without the Con&s;ent of their Allies. But whil&s;t it was on Foot, which made the King grant the larger Terms, his Forces under the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> were beaten near <HI>Mons</HI> by the <HI>Engli&s;h, Dutch,</HI> and <HI>Germans.</HI> In which Action, his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty of <HI>England</HI> &s;ignalized his Valour and Con|duct to a wonder; and the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> being a Voluntier in the Ar|my,
<PB N="56" REF="32">by his Example &s;o animated the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that they let the <HI>French</HI> &s;ee they were capable of turning the Scale of Victory.</P>
<P>The&s;e Bad Succe&s;&s;es making <HI>Lewis the Great</HI> fear he &s;hould be reduced to <HI>Lewis the Little,</HI> he made &s;uch Offers (which were &s;econded by many Promi&s;es and Crafty In&s;inuations) that the <HI>States</HI> did conclude a peace, and had all their Towns, except <HI>Mae&s;treicht,</HI> delivered into their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; which made many wonder. But tho&s;e that have weighed the Matter, give the&s;e Rea&s;ons for their making a peace, when other Princes their Confederates were in Treaty; for that of <HI>Nimeguen</HI> was &s;till on Foot:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, They perceived the Amba&s;&s;adors of their Allies, had been &s;everal Years in debate at <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> without bring|ing any thing to Perfection as to the Treaty with <HI>France;</HI> and they had great|ly wa&s;ted their Trea&s;ure in the War, and found a peace was nece&s;&s;ary to Re|cruit.</P>
<P>Secondly, Their Trade, on which the Provinces mo&s;tly depend, was greatly ob&s;tructed; by which means the People were Impoveri&s;hed.</P>
<P>Thirdly, They were Con&s;trained to
<PB N="57" REF="32">take up Moneys on the publick Tru&s;t, to &s;upply the Charge of the War; which being of long Continuance, could not but have con&s;umed va&s;t Trea&s;ures</P>
<P>Fourthly, That the <HI>Spaniard</HI> had not tho&s;e Forces on foot in the <HI>Netherlands</HI> that was Expected; which might have hindered the <HI>French</HI> from taking &s;everal Towns in <HI>Flanders,</HI> of which, without any con&s;iderable Oppo&s;ition, they had po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Fifthly, That all things were re&s;tored to them that had been taken away, which would have been difficult to have Recovered by other means.</P>
<P>Sixthly, By this Treaty they cau&s;ed to be rendered up to <HI>Spain,</HI> part of what had been taken during the War.</P>
<P>Seventhly, That the <HI>French</HI> Mini&s;ters a&s;&s;ured the <HI>States,</HI> that they would &s;pee|dily make a Peace with their Allies, and that they, <HI>the States,</HI> &s;hould be Arbi|trators of that Peace.</P>
<P>The&s;e are given as Rea&s;ons. And indeed, con&s;idering how the Mini&s;ters of <HI>France</HI> pre&s;&s;ed it with Eagerne&s;s, and declared the Extream Pa&s;&s;ion and De|&s;ire the King their Ma&s;ter had to be at peace; it might have been thought, that he mean'd as he &s;aid. The King
<PB N="58" REF="33">him&s;elf, during the Negotiation, &s;ent them a Letter, wherein he &s;tyled them, <HI>His good Friends, Allies, and Confederates;</HI> promi&s;ing wonderful things in the mo&s;t obliging Flattery. But no Words or Promi&s;es can bind this <HI>Leviathan;</HI> for <HI>Lewis</HI> knew well enough what he did by making a Separate Peace; con&s;ide|ring, if he &s;hould be brought to Strict Terms with all the Allies, he mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity part with <HI>Lorrain</HI> to the Duke, its <HI>Rightful Lord,</HI> and with the <HI>Franche Compte</HI> of <HI>Bourgogne,</HI> to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> taken, contrary to faith given, &s;ince the <HI>Pyrenean</HI> Treaty. But, by not ha|ving the <HI>Dutch</HI> Army upon his back, he &s;ound him&s;elf able to deal with the re&s;t, and to tire them out by delays. And indeed, by taking the&s;e Mea&s;ures, he con&s;trained the Duke of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Zel,</HI> to re&s;tore all they had taken from the <HI>Sweed,</HI> &s;ince that King &s;tood for the <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>King <HI>Charles</HI> II. of <HI>England,</HI> perceiv|ing <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. delayed the Treaty to incroach upon <HI>Flanders,</HI> found his Ho|nour touched, &s;ince he became a Medi|ator, and was to be Guarrantee of the Peace. And thereupon &s;ent over five or &s;ix Thou&s;and Men, to defend the <HI>Spa|ni&s;h
<PB N="59" REF="33">Netherlands,</HI> where the <HI>French,</HI> du|ring the Treaty, and daily Expectation of Peace, were like &s;o many <HI>Tartars,</HI> or wild <HI>Arabians,</HI> Ravaging and de&s;troy|ing the Country; but the Terrour of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> put a Check to their Pro|gre&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. having obtained a Peace with the <HI>States</HI> of the <HI>&V;nited Provinces,</HI> he more and more delayed the Treaty of <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> as not doubting to bring the other <HI>Confederates</HI> to more Advan|tageous Terms, than otherwi&s;e he could have been capable of doing. And that which made the <HI>French</HI> King more ur|gent for a Separate Peace, was, that he knew well enough that it could not be Rea&s;onably made with the <HI>Allies</HI> in Con|junction, but that the Country of <HI>Lor|rain</HI> would be required for that Duke, and the <HI>Franche Compte</HI> for the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> or what ever had been &s;natched from that Crown &s;ince the <HI>Pyrenean</HI> Peace, which had been &s;o openly vio|lated by <HI>France.</HI> And therefore he con|cluded, to divide the <HI>Allies</HI> was to make his own Terms. And indeed it &s;o fell out, to the great prejudice of the <HI>Con|federaters,</HI> E&s;pecially <HI>Spain</HI> and the <HI>Em|pire,</HI> as in due place will appear. And
<PB N="60" REF="34">indeed, <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. by this means pre|&s;erved mo&s;t of his important Conque&s;ts at that time, whil&s;t the <HI>Elector</HI> of <HI>Bran|denburg,</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Zell,</HI> found them&s;elves in a Nece&s;&s;ity to Re&s;tore to <HI>Sweden</HI> all they had taken, or, by &s;tand|ing out, run the Hazard of a <HI>French</HI> Ar|my Ravaging their Countries; whil&s;t their <HI>Allies,</HI> who had already made peace, could not fairly give them any A&s;&s;i&s;tence; unle&s;s, like him with whom they had made the peace, they layed no Stre&s;s upon Leagues, any longer than it tended to their purpo&s;e. But the <HI>Em|peror,</HI> as well as <HI>Holland,</HI> having con|cluded with <HI>France,</HI> the re&s;t found them|&s;elves too weak long to contend with a <HI>Monarch</HI> of &s;uch va&s;t Territories, and one who&s;e Flatterers &s;tyle <HI>Invincible;</HI> though, the contrary has often appea|red. And, according to the opinion of Politicians and tho&s;e Experienced in war, had that va&s;t Army of the <HI>Confederates</HI> been unanimous, and vigourou&s;ly pu&s;hed on, they might, by entering the very Heart of <HI>France,</HI> have reduced the Great|ne&s;s of <HI>Lewis,</HI> and have made their own Terms. <HI>Sed, divide, et Impera.</HI></P>
<P>The Peace, as is already &s;aid, being concluded with <HI>Holland</HI> at <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> a|bout
<PB N="61" REF="34">the latter End of the Year 1678, was &s;oon followed by his <HI>Imperial</HI> Ma|je&s;ty. But, before either of the&s;e were concluded, it will not be ami&s;s to &s;hew the plau&s;ible pretences of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. to the former, in a Letter in An&s;wer to a Letter to the <HI>States General,</HI> pre&s;ented him by their Amba&s;&s;ador, the <HI>Heer Vain Beverning,</HI> in the&s;e Words:</P>

<P>The Matter to which <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. re|fers them to, is a <HI>Memorial</HI> delivered to the afore&s;aid <HI>Amba&s;&s;ador</HI> by his Order, in the&s;e following Words:</P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">THE King hath with Plea&s;ure &s;een, as by a Letter from the <HI>States Ge|neral,</HI> &s;o by the A&s;&s;urances which they have given him by the <HI>Heer Van Be|verning,</HI> their <HI>Extraordinary Amba&s;&s;ador,</HI>
<PB N="63" REF="35">that their Intentions to a general Peace, corre&s;pond with the De&s;ires his Ma|je&s;ty hath always had to procure the &s;ame; and that they are ready to ac|cept the Conditions that his Maje&s;ty hath offered them by his <HI>Amba&s;&s;adors</HI> and <HI>Plenepotentiaries</HI> at <HI>Nimeguen.</HI> But, at the &s;ame time the <HI>Heer Van Bever|ning</HI> hath made known to him the Sen|timents of the &s;aid <HI>States General,</HI> he hath in their Names pray'd, that his Maje&s;ty would grant a Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms for &s;ix Weeks, and hath repre&s;ented to him, that they had need of that time to Communicate with their Allies, and obtain their Con&s;ent for the concluding &s;o great a Work: The Condition in which his Maje&s;ty's Arms are at pre|&s;ent, and the favourable Opportunity that would be lo&s;t in deferring their Acting, would not permit him to con|&s;ent to this Propo&s;al, if the de&s;ire of giving Peace to <HI>Europe</HI> did not much more prevail with him, than that of enlarging his Frontiers by new Con|que&s;ts. It is upon this Con&s;idera|tion, of contributing to the publick Repo&s;e, that he will agree, at the de|&s;ire of the &s;aid <HI>States General,</HI> to a Ce&s;|&s;ation of Arms for Six Weeks; &s;uch a
<PB N="64" REF="36">one as was &s;tipulated between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain, Anno</HI> 1668. But for as much as it would not be ju&s;t, if the Enemies of his Maje&s;ty &s;hould let the time pa&s;s fruitle&s;ly; and that, in&s;tead of its &s;erving to Advance the Peace, they &s;hould make Advantage of it, to avoid the Effect of his Maje&s;ty's Arms, that he &s;hould have lo&s;t the advanta|geous Conjuncture that is at pre&s;ent in his Hands: His Maje&s;ty de&s;ires of the &s;aid <HI>States General,</HI> that they do pro|mi&s;e him, that in ca&s;e during the Time of Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms, they cannot bring their <HI>Allies</HI> to accept the Conditions he hath offered, that they will not a&s;&s;i&s;t them directly or indirectly again&s;t him or his <HI>Allies,</HI> during the whole Cour&s;e of the War. In Exchange, his Ma|je&s;ty will in &s;uch Ca&s;e renew to them the &s;ame Engagements, which he hath taken with them, by his Letter of the Eighteenth of the la&s;t Month, as well as what concerns the&s;e &s;ame Conditi|ons, which he will be always ready to agree to. As for the &s;ecurity of the Places in the <HI>Spani&s;h Netherlands,</HI> his Maje&s;ty hath thought fit to make known unto the <HI>States General,</HI> by this <HI>Memo|rial</HI> which he hath appointed to be de|livered
<PB N="65" REF="36">to the <HI>Heer Van Beverning,</HI> the &s;incerity of his Intentions for a Peace. And to give yet a greater Te&s;timony thereof, he doth Command the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> General of his Army, to go and expect their An&s;wer, during this Month, in the Neighbourhood of <HI>Bru&s;|&s;els,</HI> with Orders not to Attack any Place during that time.</Q></P>
<P>In this we may ob&s;erve no &s;mall piece of <HI>French</HI> Policy, not &s;o much de&s;iring the Peace of <HI>Europe,</HI> (which has never been the aim of this Ambitious Prince,) as during the time of this Truce, to draw his Army farther into <HI>Flanders,</HI> which &s;oon after proved almo&s;t the Ruine of many delicious places in that fruitful Country, when Peace was in the high|e&s;t Pro&s;pect. And the&s;e Flatteries &s;er|ved only to render tho&s;e he treated with &s;omewhat more &s;ecure, whil&s;t he made his own Markets. And indeed by the&s;e, and &s;uch like Artifices, he gained upon the Belief and good Intention of the <HI>Con|federates,</HI> more than by open &s;incerity he thought convenient to do. For <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. having earne&s;tly &s;ued for Peace, though under a Re&s;erve or Mask of Di&s;|gui&s;e, which was not then &s;ufficiently
<PB N="66" REF="37">looked through, all the Princes and States of <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed they &s;hould remain at re&s;t; and tho&s;e Coun|tries that were at the brink of Ruine, by being the Seats of a tedious War, be|gan to rejoice, thinking the <HI>French</HI> King in good earne&s;t; and that he would (af|ter &s;o much Wa&s;te and De&s;olation, by Firing, Plundering, Quartering, Ex|actions, Contributions, Slaughters, and making the Fields white with the Bones of the Slain, whil&s;t the Rivers were di&s;coloured, and run red to the Sea with <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Blood,) take pity on the langui&s;hing E&s;tate of; <HI>Europe,</HI> there being a powerful Enemy in the <HI>Ea&s;t, viz.</HI> the <HI>Ottoman Emperor.</HI> But, in&s;tead of Sincerity, all proved but out&s;ide and formal. For <HI>France</HI> rather coveted time to breath a little, than to give over. And <HI>Lewis,</HI> who &s;o often pretends to make War for the Glory of his Arms, that he might with le&s;s trouble Invade the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> &s;ecretly Negotiated with <HI>Teckely,</HI> to Invade with an Army, &s;uch as he could gather in the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Territories, the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s Hereditary Countries in <HI>Hungary, &amp;c.</HI> furni&s;hing him with Money, and folliciting by his Amba&s;&s;adors at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> with Gifts,
<PB N="67" REF="37">Pre&s;ents, and promi&s;e of Diver&s;ion on the other-&s;ide, to break the Truce. And all this under the glorious Title of <HI>the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King,</HI> and <HI>Elde&s;t Son of the Church;</HI> which even barbarous Na|tions have dete&s;ted in a time of Peace. And yet, &s;uch have been the Humours of this King's Flatterers, that they have more and more blown up his Ambition, by comparing him <HI>to the Sun,</HI> as, <HI>to the Star of Stars, from whence all other Kings and Potentates receive their Lu&s;tre,</HI> with many other Attributes, as if they in|tended to &s;et him up for an <HI>Idol</HI> for all the World to fall down before.

<P>By this 'tis evident, That when he pa&s;&s;ed his Word to the <HI>Elector,</HI> and ap|proved the Loyalty of his <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Sub|jects, he had it in his thoughts upon his fir&s;t coming to the Crown to &s;uppre&s;s them.

<PB N="77" REF="42">Malice high enough in Cruelty again&s;t People that had never injured them; whil&s;t the <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> like the <HI>Jews,</HI> when <HI>Aha&s;uerus</HI>'s Decree went forth, mourned their hard Fate, and made their Application to the King; but <HI>He&s;ter</HI>'s Tears could not prevail with his <HI>Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty,</HI> though they had power to make a <HI>Heathen</HI> relent.</P>
<P>The <HI>Intendent</HI> of the <HI>&V;pper Guienne,</HI> who Re&s;ided at <HI>Montauban,</HI> &s;ummoned the Chief <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> of that City to appear before him, and let them know, That it was the <HI>unalterable Plea&s;ure</HI> of the King, to have but <HI>one Religion</HI> in his Kingdom, and that they mu&s;t prepare to com|ply with it; giving them time to a&s;&s;em|ble them&s;elves in the <HI>Town-hou&s;e,</HI> where they unanimou&s;ly agreed, rather to die than violate their Con&s;ciences, and by one deputed by the re&s;t &s;ent their Re&s;o|lution, when, the following Day, a Ba|tallion of <HI>La Ferre,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of Sixteen Companies, entered the City, and were followed by a greater Number. The <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> thereupon con&s;ulted each o|ther, and re&s;olved to &s;ubmit to what &s;hould befal them, not caring for the Spoil of their Goods, &s;o they might pre|&s;erve their Religion, re&s;olving to rely
<PB N="78" REF="43">on Providence; and the Richer agreed to help the Poorer to the la&s;t of their Sub|&s;tance. But whil&s;t they were thus con|&s;ulting, the <HI>Dragoons</HI> entered their Hou|&s;es like the Locu&s;ts of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and having eaten up all they found, fell to de&s;troy|ing their Goods, &s;uffering their Wines and other Liquors to run about the Cellers, &s;cattering al&s;o their Corn in the Streets. And when they grew even wea|ry of this wa&s;teful De&s;truction, they car|ried Linnen, Plate, Puter, and other things, to the Market-place, and offer|ed it to Sail, where the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> and <HI>Popi&s;h Prie&s;ts</HI> bought them for trivial Prices, and encouraged the <HI>Lay-Papi&s;ts</HI> to do the like. So that the <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> in four or five days, lo&s;t to the value of a Milli|on; yet they might be &s;aid, even to take joyfully the &s;poiling of their Goods: But when this availed not to &s;hake their Con|&s;tancy, the&s;e Mi&s;&s;ionaries of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. very proper Fellows to convert Souls, fell to Out-raging their Per&s;ons with Cruelties and Barbarities wor&s;e than Death. One <HI>Bervois</HI> they dragged to the Guards, and there for a whole Night the Soldiers continued in turns to kick and buffet him. Mon&s;ieur <HI>Solignack</HI>'s Hand they bound to a Spit, and forced
<PB N="79" REF="43">him to turn it, till, by the Exce&s;&s;ive Fire they made, he him&s;elf was near Roa&s;ted to Death: And, to &s;hew their farther Malice, made a Stable of his Di|ning-room, where the Furniture was worth Ten thou&s;and <HI>Livres,</HI> which they afterward de&s;troyed. Another Per&s;on they dragged to <HI>Ma&s;s,</HI> and becau&s;e he hung back, and cryed out, <HI>He would ne|ver do it,</HI> they beat him to Death. But &s;hould we come to particular Per&s;ons, the Numbers would fill a Volume as large as tho&s;e of the <HI>Martyrs.</HI></P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Garri&s;on,</HI> a Venerable Man, who had done great Kindne&s;s for the <HI>Intendent,</HI> went to wait upon him in this extremity to intreat his Protection; but he, like a true <HI>Papi&s;t,</HI> who holds no Faith to be kept with <HI>Hereticks,</HI> notwith|&s;tanding he offered him all his Goods, not only rejected his &s;uit, but cau&s;ed him, beyond what he had &s;uffered, to be dragged through the Streets, and mi&s;e|rably mi&s;u&s;ed, as a means to deterr others from Petitioning him. This &s;ort of con|verting was not only u&s;ed in this City, but throughout all the Dominions of the King, though in different Methods of &s;tudied Cruelty. Some they to&s;&s;ed from one Soldier to another, kicking, buf|feting,
<PB N="80" REF="44">and beating them with Rods three or four Days and Nights together to keep them waking; and when at any time they fainted, or &s;unk down, then they u&s;ed them in that manner on the Ground, or on Beds, and when they had re&s;ted, rou&s;ed them again: Some they hung up by the Heels, and &s;moaked them with burning wet Straw, till they were almo&s;t dead Some again they blew up almo&s;t to bur&s;ting, by putting a pair Bellows into their Fundaments: They ba&s;ted the Soles of the Feet of others with Lard, and held them to a Fire till almo&s;t Roa&s;ted. One <HI>I&s;aac Favin,</HI> a Citizen of <HI>Negropli&s;&s;e,</HI> they hung up by the Armpits a whole Night, and pinched off his Fle&s;h with Pincers, yet could not prevail to make him abjure.</P>
<P>The&s;e Cruelties, and many more, were committed not only upon Men, but al&s;o upon Women, and even upon Children that were of any Years. The younger Infants were every where taken from their Parents by force, and thru&s;t into Mona&s;teries and Nunneries; Wives, Wi|dows, and Virgins were in many Places Ravi&s;hed and Deflowred. Some Chil|dren, though of very tender Years, they kept fa&s;ting till they fainted, and then
<PB N="81" REF="44">brought them before their Parents, as imagining they would rather turn, than &s;ee their Children Peri&s;h. Many times the Prie&s;ts would per&s;uade &s;ome to Abjure, declaring, it &s;hould be only &s;eemingly, to comply with the King's <HI>Decree;</HI> but when they had unadvi&s;edly done that, in hopes of &s;ome re&s;pite, then they compelled them to torment their Friends and Relations into an Ab|juration; the which, if they did not in three Days, or &s;o much time as was gi|ven them, the <HI>Booted Apo&s;tles</HI> are &s;ent to them again, upon a &s;cruple of their not being thorowly Converted. Sometimes they bind the Mothers, that give &s;uck, to Po&s;ts, and lay their Infants to peri&s;h in their &s;ight, unle&s;s they will Abjure. And when the&s;e <HI>Dragoons</HI> were weary of tormenting, and inventing new manner of Torments, tired with the patience of the Sufferers, and de&s;pairing to bring them to their Terms, the Officers Rate them, and &s;end them back to torture them wor&s;e, &s;aying, <HI>The King has Com|manded it, and it mu&s;t be done;</HI> bawling out, <HI>That the King intends to have but one Religion in his Dominions.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e are the plea&s;ant Paths by which <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. invites his <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Subjects
<PB N="82" REF="45">to enter into the Bo&s;om of <HI>Mother-Church,</HI> exceeding tho&s;e of the <HI>Heathen</HI> Empe|rors; for they only killed, and made way for the triumphing <HI>Martyr</HI> to enter into Glory; but here they have a linger|ing Death, and by a <HI>Series</HI> of Torments, above what humane Nature is able to bear, their Hearts are &s;ometimes forced to give their Tongues the Lye. Some Per&s;ons they tortured with Engines, and put bra&s;s Pans or Kettles over the Heads of others, and with continual beating upon them, made the Party in a manner di&s;tracted. Tho&s;e of the better Sort fled to <HI>Paris,</HI> thinking the <HI>Dragoons</HI> would not come &s;o near the King's Pa|lace: But alas, there they found no Re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">uge; for a <HI>Decree</HI> was &s;et forth, com|manding them to depart the City, and retire to their re&s;pective Habitations on greater Pains and Penalties. Nor did the&s;e Mon&s;ters of Converters only &s;pightfully mi&s;u&s;e their Per&s;ons, but likewi&s;e &s;hewed their Malice upon the poor Cattle; as if the King had commanded them to bring the Hogs, Cows, Sheep, and Oxen over to the Church, as well as their Owners; for &s;ome of them they Hoxed, and &s;o &s;uffered them, for want of Legs, to go to peri&s;h in the Fields; others they killed
<PB N="83" REF="45">out-right, and &s;uffered to rot on the Ground. Some again they drove into Rivers and drowned. They cut down the Timber, and burnt it; de&s;troyed their Vineyards, and &s;old their Hou&s;es; drew their Fi&s;h-ponds, and threw their Fi&s;h into the Street.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Mi&s;&s;ionaries</HI> exceeding the Bar|barity of <HI>Tartars,</HI> were attended by a multitude of Ra&s;cally <HI>Friars</HI> and <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> to take Confe&s;&s;ions and Abjurations, as likewi&s;e by a <HI>Bi&s;hop,</HI> before whom they were to be Examined. And when tho&s;e that through Torments, and being tired out, had Abjured, were at <HI>Ma&s;s,</HI> they had Spies &s;et upon them; and if it appeared that they did it not &s;incerely, then they were thrown back into their former Mi|&s;ery. And although the&s;e Loyal People (as the King him&s;elf confe&s;&s;ed them to be) would have left all they had, and for&s;aken the Country; yet that was for|bid them on &s;trict Penalties, as even Death, or perpetual Impri&s;onment. The <HI>Ports</HI> were &s;trictly watch'd, and Ships on pain of Forfeiture forbidden to take them in; yet, through Providence, many e&s;|caped into <HI>England, Holland, Germany, &amp;c.</HI> and found Succour and Shelter. Their Mini&s;ters only found the Favour
<PB N="84" REF="46">to be Bani&s;hed, but to leave behind them their Wives, Children, and Relations: Nay, they hardly e&s;caped &s;ending to the <HI>Gallies;</HI> for &s;uch are the <HI>&V;nchri&s;tian</HI> Ways of the <HI>Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King,</HI> that he will have it a Crime, in his Country, for Men to be Learned and Vertuous: So by this means a Million of Families were ruined, and many Thou&s;ands pe|ri&s;hed through Want, Torture, and in Pri&s;ons; for all the Gaols of the Pro|vinces were filled with the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;ed People. Nor did their Malice and Cru|elty &s;top here; for although the Mini|&s;ters had Liberty to go into Bani&s;hment, under the harde&s;t of Conditions; yet the King's Mini&s;ters on the <HI>Frontiers,</HI> frequently &s;topped them, under frivo|lous pretences, till the time given them to depart was expired; and then char|ged them with breaking the Orders, in not departing within the limited time, and that they mu&s;t go to the Gallies; by which means they &s;tripped them of all that little they had left; and well they thought it, if they &s;o e&s;caped, to wan|der in &s;trange Lands, and relie upon Pro|vidence, which indeed did almo&s;t every where plentifully provide for them.

<P>But the <HI>Pope,</HI> in a matter purely Tem|poral, as are the&s;e <HI>Franchi&s;es,</HI> has made u&s;e of the Spriritual Arms, which he is intru&s;ted with, only for the Conduct and Edification of the Church. (Here, by the way, the <HI>Pope</HI> might have de|manded

<P>Let us look now a little back, and we &s;hall find Count <HI>Teckely</HI> in <HI>Hungary</HI> de|&s;troying with Fire and Sword, rai&s;ing Troops with <HI>French</HI> Gold; and though a <HI>Prote&s;tant,</HI> &s;ecretly encouraged to In|vade the <HI>Empire</HI> by the <HI>French</HI> Emi&s;&s;aries, with Promi&s;e of greater A&s;&s;i&s;tance. But proving too weak of him&s;elf to oppo&s;e the Armies that were drawn that way, the <HI>Turks</HI> broke the Truce at the In&s;tiga|tion of <HI>France,</HI> as will more largely ap|pear when we come to in&s;ert the <HI>Empe|ror</HI>'s Declaration of War with <HI>France.</HI> And under that Advantage, the Impe|rial Troops being drawn off, <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. very Piou&s;ly Be&s;ieged and took the City of <HI>Stra&s;burg,</HI> a <HI>Free Imperial Town,</HI> when hardly any Body expected any Ho&s;ti|lity. His pretence was, to re&s;tore the <HI>Bi&s;hop,</HI> which that <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> City refu&s;ed to admit with his <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Trnmpery. The Articles of Surrender were very advan|tageous to the Citizens; as, a promi&s;e of their Religion, Liberties, and any thing they de&s;ired. But the <HI>French</HI> gain|ing Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;oon barred them of a great part, delivering many over to the Mercy of the enraged <HI>Bi&s;hop,</HI> who never was any Favourer of the <HI>Prote&s;tants;</HI> and likewi&s;e re&s;tored <HI>Popery,</HI> building a
<PB N="103" REF="55">Cittadel, or Ca&s;tle, for the better cur|bing the Citizens; many of whom find|ing them&s;elves &s;o hardly dealt with at fir&s;t, and fearing wor&s;e, &s;ecretly with|drew, with what Sub&s;tance they could, to other Cities remote; whereupon the Effects they left were &s;eized, a &s;trict Charge was given to have an Eye upon the Inhabitants, and &s;uch as they &s;u&s;pe|cted going off were Impri&s;oned, and all the &s;mall Towns and Villages were taken in as Dependences, and con&s;trained to pay great Contributions; and &s;uch as could not, or refu&s;ed, were threatned with Military Execution. A great Army al&s;o of the King's, lay hovering on the <HI>We&s;t</HI> Frontiers of the <HI>Empire,</HI> whil&s;t <HI>Cara Mu&s;tapha,</HI> the <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> was coming down on the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> like a De|luge, with about Two hundred thou|&s;and <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars,</HI> who burnt and de&s;troyed all before them: For by this time, <HI>Mahomet</HI> IV. had proclaimed War again&s;t the <HI>Emperor,</HI> and detained the Count <HI>de Caprara,</HI> his Amba&s;&s;ador. All Princes of the <HI>Empire,</HI> upon the &s;udden <HI>Allarm,</HI> were in doubt, and &s;u&s;pence, which of the&s;e <HI>Turks</HI> they ought mo&s;t to fear. Though <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. out of a &s;eem|ing pretence for the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> had
<PB N="104" REF="56">made an offer to a&s;&s;i&s;t the <HI>Emperor;</HI> but this was only &s;hadow, as appeared af|terwards, by his violent falling upon the <HI>Spani&s;h Netherlands,</HI> whereby the Forces of the King of <HI>Spain</HI> were hinder|ed from A&s;&s;i&s;ting in the common Cau&s;e. And although mo&s;t of the Princes of <HI>Eu|rope</HI> u&s;ed their Intere&s;t with him, though all <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> in a manner lay at &s;take, nothing would prevail, till he perceived the <HI>Turks</HI> could not effect what they pur|po&s;ed. For, in the Year 1683&punc; they were totally Routed, and beat off from the Siege of <HI>Vienna,</HI> the principal City of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> when it was at the la&s;t <HI>Cri&s;is,</HI> and could have held out but a few days longer.</P>
<P>It is no wonder that the <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> who, on all Hands, are dete&s;ted, and accoun|ted the Incendiaries of <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> by the moderate <HI>Roman Cotholicks,</HI> have &s;o great an Influence in <HI>France,</HI> &s;ince Father <HI>Maimburgh,</HI> and Father <HI>La Che&s;e</HI> have had &s;o great an Influence over <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. to who&s;e fiery Spirit they labour to add Fuel, and plunge him into Cruelty with|out Remor&s;e, or di&s;tingui&s;hing <HI>Prote|&s;tants</HI> from <HI>Roman Catholicks.</HI> And the&s;e were the ble&s;&s;ed pair, that laid the Foun|dation of the Mi&s;ery of his Subjects of
<PB N="105" REF="56">the <HI>Reformed Religion,</HI> by per&s;uading him, That by Rooting the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> out of his Kingdom, he would render him&s;elf greater than his Ance&s;tors, who were never able to accompli&s;h that mat|ter; and, that if he could bring it to pa&s;s, it would render his Name Im|mortal in the <HI>Roman</HI> Kalendar. And, no doubt, as many In&s;tances affirm, the&s;e Locu&s;ts who &s;eek to devour every thing that is plea&s;ant, have had as great an Influence in the Ruine of the Neighbou|ring <HI>Roman Catholicks.</HI> For, from the Widene&s;s of his Conque&s;ts, they could not but promi&s;e to them&s;elves great Ad|vantage, where they have &s;o great an Influence over the Conqueror, as to have his very Con&s;cience in their keeping and di&s;po&s;e. We have not of late heard that any, like Father <HI>Ante,</HI> have repro|ved him for Exorbitancy of Lu&s;t, or o|ther Vices, but rather encouraged him therein, that they might reap the pro|fit at the Price of his Eternal State. And of this we may give &s;ome hints, as we find it in a Letter that has of late been frequently Printed, and held to be Au|thentick, &s;ent from <HI>La Che&s;e,</HI> Confe&s;&s;or to the <HI>French</HI> King, to Father <HI>Edmund Petre,</HI> late <HI>Great Almoner</HI> to King <HI>James</HI> II.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Mo&s;t Reverend Father,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO &s;atisfie the de&s;ire I have to &s;how you by my Letter, the Choice you ought to make of &s;uch per&s;ons fit to &s;tir up, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I will, in few words, &s;ince you de&s;ire it, inform you of the <HI>Genius</HI> of the people of our Court, of their inclinations, and of them we make u&s;e of, that, by a Parallel you make be|tween them and your <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> you make u&s;e of, you may know them. There|fore I &s;hall begin with the Chief, I mean our Great Monarch. It is certain, he is naturally Good, and loves not to doe Evil, unle&s;s de&s;ired to doe it. This being &s;o, I may &s;ay, he never would have undertaken the Conver&s;ion of his Subjects, without the Clergy of <HI>France,</HI> and without our <HI>Society's</HI> Corre&s;pon|dence abroad. He is a Prince Inlightned, who very well ob&s;erves, what we put him upon is contrary to his Intere&s;t,
<PB N="107" REF="57">and that nothing is more oppo&s;ite to his great De&s;igns and his Glory, he aiming to be the Terrour of all <HI>Europe.</HI> The va&s;t number of Malecontents he has cau&s;ed in his Kingdom, forces him in time of <HI>Peace,</HI> to keep up three times more Forces than his Ance&s;tors did in the greate&s;t Dome&s;tick and Foreign <HI>Wars,</HI> which cannot be done without prodigious Expence.</P>
<P>The Peoples Fears al&s;o begin to le&s;|&s;en as to his a&s;piring to an <HI>&V;niver&s;al Monarchy,</HI> and they may a&s;&s;ure them|&s;elves he has left tho&s;e Thoughts, no|thing being more oppo&s;ite to his de&s;igns, than the method we enjoin him. His Candour, Bounty, and Toleration to the <HI>Hereticks,</HI> would undoubtedly have opened the door of the <HI>Low Countries, Palatinate,</HI> and other States of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and even of <HI>Switzerland;</HI> whereas things are at pre&s;ent &s;o altered, that we &s;ee the <HI>Hollanders</HI> at pre&s;ent free from any fear of Danger, the <HI>Switzers</HI> and City of <HI>Geneva</HI> re&s;olved to lo&s;e the la&s;t drop of their Blood in their de|fence. Be&s;ide &s;ome Diver&s;ions we may expect from the <HI>Empire,</HI> In ca&s;e we can|not hinder a Peace with the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>Sir, His Maje&s;ty's Brother is always
<PB N="108" REF="58">the &s;ame, I mean, he takes no notice of what pa&s;&s;es at Court. It has &s;ometimes happened, the King's Brothers have acted &s;o, as to be noted in the State: But, this we are &s;ure, will never do any thing to &s;tain the Glory of his Sub|mi&s;&s;ion and Obedience, and is willing to lend a helping hand for the De&s;tru|ction of the <HI>Hereticks,</HI> by the In&s;tance he makes to his Maje&s;ty, who now has promi&s;ed him to cau&s;e his Troops to enter the <HI>Palatinate</HI> the next Month. The <HI>Dauphin</HI> is pa&s;&s;ionately given up to Hunting, and little regards the Con|ver&s;ion of Souls; and therefore we do not care to Con&s;ult him, how or which way the <HI>Hereticks</HI> &s;hall be de&s;troyed. He openly laughs at us, and &s;lights all the De&s;igns of which the King his Fa|ther makes great Account.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>The Letter goes on to Characterize the <HI>Dauphine&s;s</HI> in her witty Humour, and Hatred to the <HI>Prote&s;tants;</HI> as like|wi&s;e Mon&s;ieur <HI>Lovois,</HI> the <HI>Archbi&s;hop</HI> of <HI>Paris,</HI> and others, who labour to Agran|dize <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. by following the Me|thods of the <HI>Society</HI> of <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> who have always been held the Foxes with Fire-Brands at their Tails, who have labou|red to promote Violence, War, and Blood|&s;hed
<PB N="109" REF="58">in all Places where they come. <HI>Hen|ry</HI> IV. Bani&s;hed them <HI>France,</HI> and de|moli&s;hed their Hou&s;es, for &s;etting one of their Pupils to kill him in his Pre&s;ence|chamber amid&s;t his <HI>Nobles,</HI> becau&s;e he would not hearken to their Coun&s;els, but dete&s;ted their pernicious Ways. Yet, knowing them to be Sycophants, fraught with Malice and Revenge, after he had fru&s;trated many of their Attempts, that great Prince, who had faced Death in all its Shapes, fearing their wicked Pur|po&s;es, thought fit to make fair Weather with them, and to recall them; which being oppo&s;ed by a <HI>Lord</HI> of his <HI>Council,</HI> who alledged how pernicious they were in all Kingdoms, States and Governments, the King pa&s;&s;ionately broke out into this Expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>viz. Secure me my Life then.</HI> And indeed, this King who had remain|ed &s;afe in forty Battels, found his Death, as has been &s;aid, in the mid&s;t of his <HI>Ca|pital City,</HI> among&s;t his Friends and Guards. Nor could the Ob&s;tinacy of the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate and Paricide denote any thing el&s;e, but that he was &s;et on by the&s;e Men. For <HI>Raviliack,</HI> the bloody Actor, neither &s;ought to fly, nor excu&s;e the Fact: nor, when his Fle&s;h was pluck|ed off with hot Pincers, would he con|fe&s;s
<PB N="110" REF="59">who in&s;pired him to doe it, but re|mained ob&s;tinate in the mid&s;t of the mo&s;t horrid Tortures, which demon&s;trated, that he had been decoyed by &s;uch as made him believe, the Fact was no le&s;s than Meritorious, and that Eternal Life was entailed upon him for the Deed. And no boubt, <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. is not fear|le&s;s, (notwith&s;tanding his Bravadoes) of &s;ome &s;uch Fate, if he &s;hould reject them and their Coun&s;els; which makes him &s;o far comply with their Maxims, as to involve the Nations in Blood, and carry Fire and De&s;truction where-ever his Armies come, and make him&s;elf the very <HI>Phaeton</HI> of the World. Some will object in their Excu&s;e, that <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. dares not keep his Armies Idle; for, the Soldiers having been &s;o long trained up in War by a long Ea&s;e, would grow Luxurious, and be apt, like the <HI>Roman Pretorian</HI> Soldiers, at every little di|&s;a&s;ter to Mutiny: or, if that he &s;hould disband them, they for the mo&s;t part being Incapable of any other Imploy|ment than the Sword, would infallibly &s;hake his Throne, by joining with tho&s;e his Tyranny has reduced in a manner to De&s;pair. However, any Rea&s;onable Man might think, he might employ
<PB N="111" REF="59">them in other matters, as fortifying his Inland-Towns, and building Piramids to his Glory, as the Kings of <HI>Egypt</HI> did, to keep their People from Idlene&s;s, upon the &s;ame Score, as mo&s;t Hi&s;torians con|jecture, who&s;e Labour produced tho&s;e La&s;ting Monuments, who&s;e A&s;piring Tops are &s;aid to penetrate the Clouds. But <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. is of another Mind; he is for building a Structure with the untempered Mortar of Rapin and Vio|lence, and Cementing it with <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Blood; wi&s;hing, no doubt, that all who oppo&s;e his de&s;igns, had but one Neck, as <HI>Heliogabulus</HI> did by the People of <HI>Rome,</HI> that him&s;elf, as a La&s;ting Monument of his Glory, might have the Honour of cutting it off; which &s;hews the very Spi|rit of <HI>Je&s;uit</HI>-Coun&s;els.</P>
<P>Pardon, Reader, this Digre&s;&s;ion, if it may be &s;o termed in a Hi&s;tory of this Na|ture; for, where a Man pretends Con|&s;cience, he is inclined to one &s;ide or o|ther, and ought to have the Awe of Re|ligion, of what per&s;ua&s;ion &s;oever he be, upon his Mind, favouring that party to which he inclines. But <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. is of a contrary Temper, having his Hand again&s;t all, whil&s;t all mens Hands are more ju&s;tly again&s;t him. We will not
<PB N="112" REF="60">determine, what Orders he would give in relation to <HI>Turki&s;h Mo&s;ques,</HI> or <HI>Mahomets</HI> Religion. But &s;ure we are, in all the Progre&s;s wherever his Arms have carried De&s;truction, the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Churches of what&s;oever per&s;ua&s;ion, have felt the Marks of his Irreligion and Sacrilege. Nay, it is affirmed upon credible te&s;ti|mony, that when the numerous Ho&s;t of <HI>Infidels</HI> over-ran <HI>Hungary,</HI> and the Suc|ce&s;s was doubtful, whether the Lo&s;s or Relieving <HI>Vienna</HI> &s;hould hazard or &s;ave the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> part of the Empire; and Prayers were put up almo&s;t every where for the Succe&s;s of the <HI>Chri&s;tians, Anno</HI> 1683. the <HI>Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King</HI>'s <HI>Inten|dent</HI> at S^t <HI>Omers,</HI> gave a &s;evere Repri|mand to the <HI>Bi&s;hop,</HI> for having ordered publick Prayers to be put up, and a Fa&s;t to be held on that occa&s;ion. And when this Inundation of <HI>Barbarians</HI> were en|tered <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> carrying Fire and Sword into mo&s;t of the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s Heredi|ditary Provinces, with Slaughter, Bon|dage and all the Outrages that can be Imagined; in&s;omuch that the flaming Towns and Villages &s;eemed but one great &s;cene of Fire, and the cries of the mi&s;erable People rent the Skies, which blu&s;hed with the A&s;cending Heat and Re|flexion
<PB N="113" REF="60">of Blood; even then, when all good Men were overwhelmed with Sor|row, <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. brought down his huge Armies on the Front of the <HI>Empire,</HI> to o|ver-awe the Little Princes, and keep their Troops for the Defence of their own Territories, that they might have no &s;hare in the Glory, by a&s;&s;i&s;ting the <HI>Em|peror</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Infidels.</HI> And Mon&s;ieur <HI>Seppeville</HI> was a Spie upon the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s Affairs, giving <HI>Lewis,</HI> his Ma&s;ter, from time to time, an Account of the Progre&s;s of the <HI>Turks,</HI> and of their Succe&s;s; and that the League between him and <HI>Maho|met</HI> IV. <HI>Emperor</HI> of the <HI>Turks,</HI> might be as much &s;hadowed as it was po&s;&s;ible, Mon&s;ieur <HI>Fouchay</HI> per&s;uaded him to make a Diver&s;ion in the <HI>Spani&s;h Netherlands,</HI> thereby to divert the Forces of the King of <HI>Spain</HI> from Aiding the <HI>Emperor.</HI> And here, under pretence of Dependencies, and other Matters, frivilous and ground|le&s;s, in the Opinion of the Neighbour-Princes; he &s;wep'd away many Towns, though even the <HI>Turks</HI> them&s;elves, had they determined impartially, could not but have judged it not only <HI>&V;nchri&s;tian</HI> like, but al&s;o unrea&s;onable: Or el&s;e what could any unbia&s;&s;ed Man conjecture, but that the <HI>Turks</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> King had
<PB N="114" REF="61">combined to &s;hare the <HI>Empire</HI> between them. Yet it would not have been &s;o ea&s;ie to have &s;topped an Inundation of <HI>Barbarians,</HI> flu&s;hed with Victory, as <HI>Lew|is</HI> XIV. imagined. And who can tell, but if they had prevailed, they might have been by this time in the Heart of <HI>France,</HI> and &s;hewed him play at his own Weapons. How unju&s;tly this King took <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> and other Places in the <HI>Ne|therlands,</HI> few are ignorant, even when it was lea&s;t &s;u&s;pected any Ho&s;tilities would have happened. But that great City could not &s;uffice the Ambition of this Prince; for he &s;ent his <HI>Dragoons</HI> Abroad when <HI>Spain</HI> was altogether un|provided, and under Pretence of Depen|dencies, &s;wept away whole Provinces, compelling the mi&s;erable Villages, who had been ruined by a lingering War, to part with the &s;mall Sub&s;i&s;tence they had re&s;erved for the Pre&s;ervation of Life, un|der pretence of Contribution; by which means many of them peri&s;hed in their Hou&s;es, and in the Fields, when they had eaten all the Unclean Things they could find; and tho&s;e that refu&s;ed, had their Hou&s;es fired about their Ears, and their per&s;ons Tortured, to make them confe&s;s where they had hid their Trea|&s;ure,
<PB N="115" REF="61">or Goods; &s;o that &s;ome of them died under the Tormentors Hands: By which it appears, that <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. &s;hew|ed his Zeal to the Church, in <HI>Dragooning</HI> as well the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> as the <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> and even tho&s;e of <HI>Flanders,</HI> which above all are accounted the mo&s;t zealou&s;ly Devo|ted to the <HI>Romi&s;h Super&s;tition;</HI> and this by way of Surprize, whil&s;t the <HI>Emperor</HI> of <HI>Germany,</HI> and the other Princes, his Con|federates, as has been hinted, were ac|quiring Glory at the point of their Swords. For this Monarch cares little for ingaging his Armies, it ever having been &s;een, that he has gained little or nothing by the fair dint of the Sword. And indeed, if we con&s;ider how ea&s;ily many &s;trong Towns have been delivered up to him by Garri&s;ons that were able to defend them, the World cannot but conclude, fal&s;e underhand Dealing has been a main Advancement to his Con|que&s;ts; by which Methods his va&s;t Trea|&s;ures have been frequently &s;hrunk, and his Subjects E&s;tates &s;tretched upon the Tenters to recruit them.

<P>This may &s;ufficiently demon&s;trate the good and hone&s;t Intentions of the <HI>States General,</HI> who could not think, but the Word of a King, and the <HI>Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian</HI> King, as <HI>Lewis the Great</HI> &s;tyles him&s;elf, would continue Sacred and Inviolable. But ala&s;s! his Ambition and Intere&s;t weigh down his Words and Oaths; and, in Conclu&s;ion, it appeared, that he on|ly did it to bind up their Hands, whil&s;t that he might the more &s;ecurely prey up|on the <HI>Spani&s;h Netherlands</HI> a Country the mo&s;t plea&s;ant and fruitful in <HI>Europe,</HI> and for which many of his Predece&s;&s;ors have heartily longed, but never undertook the Methods he has ob&s;erved to bring it under his Subjection. However, this <HI>Great Monarch</HI> has failed in his Expe|ctation, and has frequently been baffled, when his numerous Armies have thought them&s;elves mo&s;t &s;ure. Yet, by the way, we may Mark out a peice of <HI>French</HI> Trea|chery, though of an Elder date; by which we may &s;ee, it is in a Manner the
<PB N="121" REF="64">very <HI>Genius</HI> of the Nation, though more &s;uperabundant in <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV.</P>
<P>It &s;o happened in the <HI>Year of our Lord</HI> 1551. that the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> in <HI>Germany</HI> being greatly oppre&s;&s;ed by the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> I. <HI>Henry</HI> II. King of <HI>France,</HI> pre|tending to compa&s;&s;ionate them, &s;ent <HI>Monmorency</HI> the <HI>Con&s;table,</HI> with four thou&s;and Hor&s;e and Foot, as it were to Relieve them, who demanded with ma|ny In&s;inuations and Promi&s;es of Prote|ction, a Pa&s;&s;age through the City of <HI>Metz,</HI> a City under <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Government. The People in hopes to be delivered from the Ravages the <HI>Imperial</HI> Soldiers com|mitted in their Territories, joyfully con|&s;ented; and, in Gratitude, &s;pread Ta|bles in the Streets ready furni&s;hed with Provi&s;ion, for the Soldiers to eat as they Marced through; bringing Barrels of Wine, and other Liquors, to Accom|modate them, the Magi&s;trates waiting upon the <HI>Con&s;table</HI> with all Imaginable demon&s;trations of Kindne&s;s and Re&s;pect; who &s;eeing his time, feigned to be trou|bled with a &s;udden Fit of the Gout and other Indi&s;po&s;itions, and thereupon in|treated the Magi&s;trates, that he might have the opportunity of a Place of Re|tirement for &s;ome time, and that he not
<PB N="122" REF="65">knowing what might befal him in the Wars, or by that Sickne&s;s, was de&s;irous to make his Will. The Good-meaning Magi&s;trates were highly &s;atisfied with the Favour he would doe them, and be|gan to contend which of them &s;hould have the Honour of entertaining him. But their Joy was &s;oon turned into Mourning; for, when the Magi&s;trates and mo&s;t of the Gentry were a&s;&s;embled in his Chamber, whil&s;t the Scrivener was making his Will, to which they were to be Witne&s;&s;es, he gave private Orders for &s;eizing the Gates. And, as &s;oon as he knew it was done, ri&s;ing up in a fury, he &s;uddenly &s;tabbed the Mayor of the City to the Heart with his Dagger; which being the Signal to his Guards, they fell upon the re&s;t that were in the Chamber, and put them to the Sword. This being known, the <HI>French</HI> Soldiers over-ran the Streets, crying out, <HI>The City is won;</HI> and thereupon fell to plundering the Shops and Hou&s;es. So that this City (like the flying-Fi&s;h in the <HI>Indian</HI> Seas) whil&s;t it thought to E&s;cape one Mi&s;chief, fell into another, as great if not greater: For, of this kind of Fi&s;h, Sailors report, that being pur&s;ued by the <HI>Dolphins,</HI> and finding it
<PB N="123" REF="65">&s;elf ready to be devoured, by help of its long Fins, that &s;erve for Wings, it &s;hoots into the Air, and flies a great many pa|ces, till the Fins grow &s;tiff by dryne&s;s, and then falls into the Sea; but frequent|ly, whil&s;t it is flying, the Cormorants, and other Ravenous Fowl that haunt tho&s;e Seas, catch them, and by them they are devoured.</P>
<P>A Second In&s;tance of Later Date, we may mention in <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. Father to the pre&s;ent King, when he de&s;igned to &s;eize upon the Dukedom of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> he, by the Advice of <HI>Cardinal Richlieu,</HI> &s;ent for the old Duke to come to him at his Town of <HI>Lyons,</HI> who, dreading no &s;uch Treachery, left <HI>Nancy</HI> the Place of Se|curity, and went to Complement the King who was at the head of his Troops; and after he had payed him that Homage and re&s;pect he conceived was due to him, he prepared to return, but found him|&s;elf mi&s;taken; for he was Arre&s;ted by the Captain of the King's Guards, upon frivolous Pretences and Claims, and made him deliver up <HI>Nancy</HI> into which he entered as a Conquerour, the &s;urren|der of which occa&s;ioned the Lo&s;s of the whole <HI>Duchy.</HI> Many In&s;tances of the Like Nature, even the <HI>French</HI> Hi&s;torians

<P>The Peace, as we have &s;aid, being made, and all <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> Relying on it, and firmly keeping it, except the <HI>French</HI> King; he thought this his time to play his Game, as thinking he had Charmed the Princes, or made them fear the Con|&s;equence of a Rupture. He &s;oon forgot his Word, as appears by the <HI>Emperour</HI>'s early Complaint again&s;t his Proceedings by &s;everal Letters and Memorials, That, contrary to the Peace of <HI>Nimeguen,</HI></P>

<P N="5">5. Requiring an Oath from the <HI>Va&s;&s;als</HI> and <HI>Nobles</HI> of <HI>Al&s;ace.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Setting up Pretentions upon the <HI>Va&s;&s;als</HI> of <HI>Metz, Toul,</HI> and <HI>Verdun,</HI> as likewi&s;e upon other <HI>Imperial</HI> States and Countries</P>
<PB N="125" REF="66">
<P N="7">7. Con&s;i&s;cating the Rents and Re|venues of the <HI>Chapter</HI> of <HI>Stra&s;burg.</HI></P>

<P>And other Matters. Upon this, the <HI>Diet</HI> of <HI>Rati&s;bone,</HI> to whom the Complaint was made, after &s;ome Deliberation, came to a Re&s;olution;</P>
<P>That the proceedings of the <HI>French</HI> King were directly contrary to the Trea|ties of <HI>We&s;tphalia</HI> and <HI>Nimeguen;</HI> that therefore the <HI>Emperor</HI> &s;hall be prayed, by Letter or by Emba&s;&s;ie, in the Name of him&s;elf and the <HI>Empire,</HI> to demand of the <HI>Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King</HI> Reparation for the &s;ame; and that in the mean time the <HI>French</HI> Mini&s;ters re&s;iding at the <HI>Imperial</HI> Court and here, &s;hall be made acquain|ted with this Re&s;olution of the <HI>Diet,</HI> and that it &s;hall be repre&s;ented to them. For what concerns the two fir&s;t Points, That the &s;ame are directly contrary to the 27th of the Treaty of <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> and the Fir&s;t, Second, and Fourth Articles of the In&s;trument, afterwards &s;igned by the Amba&s;&s;adors, for the Executing the &s;aid
<PB N="126" REF="67">Treaty, that have been Religiou&s;ly ob|&s;erved by the Emperor. That the Third Point is contrary to the 30^t^h Article of the &s;aid Treaty, and the 8^t^h Article of the &s;aid In&s;trument. That for what con|cerneth the Fourth Point, it is known, that the Third Article of the Treaty of <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> &s;ays, that the Countries of the <HI>&V;pper</HI> and <HI>Lower Al&s;aces,</HI> and the <HI>Lord|&s;hip</HI> of <HI>Haguenaw,</HI> &s;hall be yeilded to <HI>France,</HI> with an Expre&s;s Exception of the 10 <HI>Imperial</HI> Towns, and their Rights and Privileges; and that the <HI>French</HI> King &s;hall pretend no Superiority over them, or require any Oath or Fidelity from them; and in pur&s;uance of the Agree|ment made at <HI>Nurenburgh,</HI> in the Year 1650. <HI>Haguenaw, Landaw,</HI> and other Pla|ces, and other of the &s;aid ten Towns, more Actually Evacuated by the <HI>French,</HI> with|out pretending then, and &s;everal years afterwards, to any Sovereignty over the &s;aid Towns, or requiring any Oath of Fidelity from them. That afterwards in 1665. Complaints were made to the <HI>Di|et,</HI> of the <HI>French</HI> &s;etting up new Preten|&s;ions; whereupon <HI>Arbitrators</HI> were cho|&s;en on the Part of the <HI>Empire</HI> and of <HI>France,</HI> Amicably to determine the &s;ame, who were &s;everal Years employed in that
<PB N="127" REF="67">work, which was put to an end by the <HI>French</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them&s;elves of the &s;aid Towns, even before the War: That the Treaty of <HI>Nimeguen</HI> Confirms that of <HI>We&s;tphalia,</HI> and con&s;equently that the &s;aid Towns ought to have re&s;tored to them the Rights and Privileges which that &s;ti|pulates for them. That for the Fifth and Sixth Points, they likwi&s;e directly con|tervene the &s;aid Treaties. That as to the Seventh, they expect farther Infor|mation in it. That for the Eighth, they cannot Imagine what Right the <HI>French</HI> have to Fortifie <HI>Sclech&s;tadt,</HI> con&s;idering what is above&s;aid of tho&s;e <HI>Free</HI> Towns. For the Ninth and Tenth, the <HI>French</HI> have acted notoriou&s;ly contrary to the <HI>We&s;tphalian</HI> and <HI>Nimeguen</HI>-Treaties. For the Eleventh, that <HI>Hamburgh</HI> belongs to ths <HI>Count</HI> of <HI>Na&s;&s;aw,</HI> as appears by the Treaty of <HI>O&s;naburgh.</HI> That concerning <HI>Bit&s;eth,</HI> they expect farther Information. And la&s;tly, They hope the King will not prejudice the City of <HI>Stra&s;burgh</HI> in its Rights or Privileges, and particularly in that of fortifying <HI>Kiel,</HI> &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for its Security.</P>
<P>This &s;o Early Breach of the Peace, that had been &s;o long laboured for by the <HI>Princes</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> much di&s;plea&s;ed
<PB N="128" REF="68">them, and filled many with Dete&s;tation, ob&s;erving that <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. went beyond the Bounds of the <HI>Decree</HI> of the <HI>Council</HI> of <HI>Con&s;tance,</HI> which &s;ays, <HI>That no Faith is to be kept with Hereticks;</HI> but he neither regards his Faith with tho&s;e the <HI>Romans</HI> unchri&s;tianly term &s;o, nor with <HI>Roman Catholicks.</HI> However, having a mind to &s;ecure what he had belonging to the <HI>Em|pire,</HI> or Princes dependent, as appears by the Re&s;olution of the <HI>Diet,</HI> in his detai|ning &s;ome, and impo&s;ing on others, con|trary to the Articles agreed on, he &s;ought to bring the <HI>States</HI> of the <HI>&V;nited Provinces</HI> into an Offen&s;ive and Defen&s;ive Alliance, again&s;t which all the Provinces, but <HI>Groningen</HI> and <HI>Frie&s;land</HI> Excepted, who did not &s;o long; and their Re&s;o|lutions were publi&s;h'd, declaring, They intended to keep inviolably the Peace and E&s;teem they had for his Maje&s;ty's Friend|&s;hip, but could not enter into any &s;uch Alliance as he required. However, he per&s;i&s;ted to encroach upon the <HI>Empire,</HI> &s;uffering his Troops, that &s;hould have been withdrawn, to quarter at di&s;cre|tion, eating up that little the Inha|bitants had left them to &s;ub&s;i&s;t withal; winking at the many Complaints that were made, and proving deaf to the Cries of the People.</P>
<PB N="129" REF="68">
<P>This occa&s;ioned the King of <HI>England</HI> to complain by his Amba&s;&s;adors; but this prevailed little or nothing, till he found a Defen&s;ive Alliance was carrying on again&s;t him; and then, under pretence of Winter Quarter, he drew off &s;ome of his Troops.</P>
<P>Let us look a little back upon the Pro|ceeding of <HI>Lewis le Grand,</HI> in the <HI>Princi|pality</HI> of <HI>Orange,</HI> a place of Sovereign Right for &s;ome Ages, belonging to the <HI>Illu&s;trious Hou&s;e</HI> of <HI>Na&s;&s;aw,</HI> and the In|heritance of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> This <HI>Principality</HI> and City of <HI>Orange,</HI> is very advantageou&s;ly Situate, exceeding fruitful, and for the mo&s;t part Inhabited by <HI>Prote&s;tants.</HI> The&s;e Con&s;i|derations made the <HI>French</HI> King Long to be Ma&s;ter of it; for he &s;eldom troubles him&s;elf to War on the <HI>Alps,</HI> or in cold barren Countries. Whereupon, during the Minority of the Prince, without the lea&s;t Title or ju&s;t Pretence to warrant his Actions, he &s;ent an Army to take Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, in the Year 1660. exerci|&s;ing a great deal of Cruelty and Inhu|manities upon the Subjects, contrary to the Law of Arms, and of Nations, de|moli&s;hing the Ba&s;tions and &s;trong Forti|fications; thereby purpo&s;ing to him&s;elf,
<PB N="130" REF="69">if he &s;hould be obliged by the Princes, who looked upon him as an Intruder and an Oppre&s;&s;or, to relinqui&s;h it, he might with more Ea&s;e repo&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of it, as he &s;aw occa&s;ion. Nay, &s;o far extended his Malice, that he not only ruined the Cittadel, but cau&s;ed the Magnificent Monuments of Prince <HI>Maurice</HI>'s Great|ne&s;s to be laid in Ruines: And indeed, in the Year 1665. he was obliged to Re|linqui&s;h that <HI>Principality,</HI> and the <HI>Sieur Zuilychem</HI> to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it for his Ma&s;ter. When in <HI>April</HI> that year, as a pre&s;age of the Prince's good Fortune, and future Greatne&s;s, a Crown of Light darting Rays, appeared over the City of <HI>Orange,</HI> hanging, as it were, in the Air, over the Palace, or place of State, ap|pointed for his Reception, to Con&s;olate his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Subjects, who for five years had groaned under the Tyranny of <HI>France.</HI> But their Tranquillity la&s;ted no longer than the Year 1673, for then the <HI>French</HI> King &s;uppo&s;ing to make his Arms the Terrour of <HI>Europe,</HI> that &s;o he might at plea&s;ure become the great Arbitre of Peace and War; he, on a &s;udden, and very unexpectedly, entered it with his Troops.

<PB N="131" REF="69">the <HI>Principality</HI> of <HI>Orange</HI> was re&s;tored, and the King of <HI>England</HI> was <HI>Guarrantee</HI> of that Peace; yet the unwearied In|croachments of the <HI>French</HI> Troops of <HI>Provence,</HI> and the Intrigues of the <HI>Po|pi&s;h</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Orange,</HI> rendered daily the Subjects of the <HI>Principality</HI> more un|ea&s;ie, till in the Year 1682. <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. in a time of full Peace, as well with the <HI>States</HI> as <HI>Confederate</HI> Princes, commanded a powerful Army to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, without any manner of colour or pre|text, but the <HI>Turki&s;h Motto,</HI> viz.</P>

<P>And thereby his booted Mi&s;&s;ionaries or Dragoons, acted inhumane Barbari|ties on the Inhabitants, unparallel'd in any Reign but his own. And here for an E&s;&s;ay of his in&s;upportable Vanity, or ra|ther of a Kindne&s;s unu&s;ual among&s;t Prin|ces, and derogatory to Maje&s;ty it &s;elf, we mu&s;t not omit; That in a <HI>Breve</HI> in Favour of the late Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> as Ad|mini&s;trator of the Duke of <HI>Long aville, Lewis</HI> XIV. had the fooli&s;h Confidence to treat his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> with the Title of <HI>Me&s;&s;ire William, Count</HI> of

<P><HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. is &s;eldom without preten|ces to quarrel with his Neighbours; for, he has for that purpo&s;e, and to exalt him&s;elf <HI>Chief Monarch</HI> of <HI>Europe,</HI> &s;et up a Chamber at <HI>Metz,</HI> called <HI>the Sovereign Court,</HI> before which he cau&s;es to be Ci|ted Kings and Princes (well knowing they will not appear then) under pre|tence their Lands are Dependences, or under the Claim of antient Titles or Claims, for which him&s;elf can give no Rea&s;on; he cau&s;es them to be condem|ned as forfeited. And from this Court, where him&s;elf is both Judge and Jury, he will admit of no Appeal, but pro|ceeds to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, by &s;ending his Troops to quarter there, and Leavy great Contributions upon the Inhabitants, that, &s;o by Impoveri&s;hing them, as he u|&s;es his own Subjects, he may the better keep them under.

<PB N="136" REF="72">Pierre,</HI> and divers others, &s;wallowing up Provinces like the <HI>Great Leviathan,</HI> with|out making any Account of Rights or Ju|&s;tice, though the time peradventure is at hand wherein he will be obliged to di&s;|gorge them with Intere&s;t. His Eye has been indeed a long while up <HI>Italy,</HI> &s;oa|ring that way towards the <HI>&V;niver&s;al Mo|narchy,</HI> which made him deal under|hand with the Duke of <HI>Mantua</HI> for the &s;trong Garri&s;on of <HI>Ca&s;&s;el,</HI> which &s;erves as an Inlet over the <HI>Alps.</HI> Nor had <HI>Ge|neva</HI> e&s;caped his Bombs, had not the <HI>Swi&s;&s;e-Cantons,</HI> fearful of their own Safety, declared with much warmth, to &s;tand by that <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> City with all their Forces.</P>
<P>The Peace being concluded with <HI>Spain, Lewis</HI> XIV. finding him&s;elf unea&s;ie to be out of Action, picks a Quarrel with that Nation about 500000 Crowns he pretended were to be re&s;tored for da|mages done in the <HI>We&s;t Indias,</HI> and there|upon &s;ent the Duke's <HI>D' E&s;tree</HI> and <HI>Mor|temer,</HI> with a Squadron of <HI>Men of War,</HI> to block up <HI>Cadiz,</HI> and to take and de&s;troy all &s;uch Merchants-&s;hips and Galleys as they light on.

The occa&s;ion or Grounds of his Quarrel was about Ceremonies, and tri|vial Matters, but where the Power is, and in a hand like that of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. it is ea&s;ie to find occa&s;ion of Offence, or to &s;ugge&s;t one.

And though perhaps he was loth to &s;hed <HI>Infidel</HI> Blood, having &s;o long deal'd in that of <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> which he had poured out in Rivolets, he found the Eyes of the Neighbouring Princes were upon him, and that his Greatne&s;s would &s;uffer an Eclip&s;e if he di&s;&s;embled it, and that he &s;hould become cheap to the World; notwith&s;tanding his being in

The reduction of this &s;trong Place, that had co&s;t &s;o great a Summ in Fortifying, and in which &s;uch confidence had been repo&s;ed, did not a little &s;tartle the Court of <HI>France;</HI> and, as is u&s;ual upon &s;uch Emergen|cies, occa&s;ioned the change of a great many Mini|&s;ters of State. And what heightned the Con|&s;ternation more, was a fear of a General Revolt of the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> of that Kingdom, &s;eeing many of them forced their Way through the French Barriers of <HI>Languedock, Provence,</HI> and <HI>Dauphin,</HI> and brought Terrour upon <HI>Savoy,</HI> (the only &s;tickling Prince for <HI>France,</HI>) joining with others in the Valleys of <HI>Piemont, Lucern, &amp;c.</HI> which ob|liged the French King to keep &s;trong Guards on the Frontier Places of <HI>Dauphin:</HI> And &s;ome French Troops attempting to burn the Corn near <HI>Ghent,</HI> were &s;o warmly received by the Cannon of the Town, and an Ambu&s;hment laid in a hollow Way, that mo&s;t of them were cut off. And now perceiving they mu&s;t quit the <HI>Electorate</HI> of <HI>Trier,</HI> they re&s;olved to u&s;e it with the &s;ame Civility
<PB N="180" REF="95">they had done the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> burning ten Towns, be&s;ide what they had formerly Con&s;umed, and laying that fruitful Country Wa&s;te like a Wil|derne&s;s; and farther proceeded to burn <HI>Franken|dale, Neu&s;tadt, Lube&s;heim, Petter&s;heim, Dirmin|&s;theim, Wachenheim,</HI> with &s;everal other Places, and a great many Villages in <HI>Hou&s;durgh.</HI> Which <HI>&V;nchri&s;tian</HI> Proceedings demon&s;trated their Power to be of &s;hort Durance in tho&s;e Countries.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Bonne,</HI> Fortified by the Care and Diligence of Cardinal <HI>Fur&s;temberg,</HI> at the extra|ordinary Charge of the <HI>French</HI> King, having been a con&s;iderable time Be&s;ieged by the <HI>Elector</HI> of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> and making a &s;tout Re&s;i&s;tance, de&s;pairing of Relief, was con&s;trained on the 10th. of <HI>October</HI> to beat a Parly, and &s;ent out three Officers to treat about Articles of Surrender, which were finally concluded; and Signed on the 12th. under Seventeen Heads, con&s;iderably Honoura|ble to the Garri&s;on; and the &s;ame Day, Three <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">undred Men of the Troops of <HI>Brandenburgh, Hol|land,</HI> and <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one of the Gates of the Town, and on the Fifteenth the Garri&s;on, which at the beginning of the Siege con|&s;i&s;ted of 7000 Men, marched out to the number of 3500, and 1500 remained &s;ick and wounded in the Town. The Governour Count <HI>Alsfelt,</HI> was carried out in a Litter, and all the Stores and Cannon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were delivered up to the <HI>Elector.</HI> So that by the Lo&s;s of this Town, the <HI>French</HI> lo&s;t their footing in tho&s;e <HI>Parts,</HI> and began to think of going into Winter-Quarters, after having in|damaged tho&s;e Countries more than Forty milli|ons can repair, in one <HI>Campaign.</HI> Whereupon, to be rid of &s;o cruel and wa&s;tful a People, the <HI>Em|peror</HI> publi&s;hed his <HI>Avocatoria,</HI> commanding all the <HI>French</HI> to depart out of his Dominions; when,
<PB N="181" REF="95">on the other hand, <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. lay great Taxes to rai&s;e Money for his carrying on the next <HI>Cam|paign.</HI></P>
<P>We might enlarge upon many other Particu|lars, to di&s;play this Ambitious and Bloodthir&s;ty <HI>Monarch,</HI> who has been &s;o long the Troubler of <HI>Europe,</HI> as his League with the Empire, his &s;ol|liciting them to make no Peace, and encou|raging them to &s;tand off, by promi&s;es of the powerful Diver&s;ions he intends to make in the <HI>We&s;tern</HI> Parts. Under the favour of which, his Amba&s;&s;ador at the <HI>Port</HI> in&s;inuates what they have lo&s;t in the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> as we find it &s;et forth at large in the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s Declaration, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But we think we have &s;aid enough, to give the World a Pro|&s;pect of this great <HI>Leviathan,</HI>
<Q><L>Who floats on Seas of Blood, with va&s;t de&s;ire</L>
<L>To out-brave Heav'n, and &s;et the World on fire.</L>
<L>But Heaven's Bolts hit &s;ure, whene'er they're aim'd,</L>
<L>And oft have Mon&s;ters, full as mighty, tam'd.</L></Q></P>
