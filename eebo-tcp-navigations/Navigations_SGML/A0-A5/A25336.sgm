<P>A Ve&s;&s;el arrived at <HI>Milford,</HI> on <HI>Saturday</HI> la&s;t, the Ma&s;ter whereof brings this following Account: That Three of Their Ma|je&s;ties Men of War, the <HI>Dover,</HI> St. <HI>Alban</HI>'s, and the <HI>Experiment,</HI> with Tenders, &s;teering their Cour&s;e for the Bay of <HI>Waterford,</HI> having a fair Wind that came up with it; and after a &s;mall time, they put Sixty cho&s;en re&s;olute Men on Shoar, within a Mile of a &s;mall place called <HI>Horkter,</HI> which had Fifty Soldiers in it; which on the Lan|ding of our Men, (it being a Place of no Strength,) they immediately fled to <HI>Waterford:</HI> After which, our Men return'd to their Ships, bringing off with them, be&s;ides a great Booty, &s;everal Prote&s;tants: Our Men verily believed, that had they had but Five Hundred Men, they could at that Juncture ea|&s;ily have &s;urpriz'd and taken the &s;trong Fort of <HI>Dungannon.</HI> We could not de&s;cry the appearance of any Parties, either of the Garri&s;on of <HI>Waterford,</HI> or <HI>Dungannon,</HI> 'till &s;ome time after our Men were abroad again, they &s;uppo|&s;ing, as we imagine, that we had &s;ome
