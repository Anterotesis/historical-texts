<P>And this hath been the labour and indu&s;try of all Per&s;ons in all ages, the Populacy, and the Vul|gar as guilty of the Innovation as tho&s;e Potentates whom they implead of a mo&s;t injurious U&s;urpation of their right: all times concurring in their &s;uffrage again&s;t this fir&s;t Law, &s;eeking nothing el&s;e in the changes and vici&s;&s;itudes of &s;o many Governments, but their temporary ea&s;e, and &s;ome particular Emoluments to them&s;elves, although they have vainly pretended, that tho&s;e their re&s;tle&s;s Agitati|ons, and irregular confu&s;ed wayes to the pertur|bation of the publique, were nothing el&s;e but na|tural tendencies, how violent &s;oever to that common Center, the <HI>Good</HI> of the <HI>Whole.</HI></P>

<PB N="3" REF="7">of its vigour; And to help out this Po&s;ition, Men have invented an Artifice, by placing &s;uch and &s;uch Nations under &s;uch &amp; &s;uch Climes &amp; Temperatures, which either do &s;o rarefact and attenuate it in &s;ome &s;harper and &s;erener Aires of <HI>Europe,</HI> that it is as good as lo&s;t, or el&s;e conden&s;ate it in &s;ome thicker and gro&s;&s;er Regions, that it is as difficult to be found.</P>
<P>And under the&s;e, or the like Capricies, are the <HI>Europeans</HI> rendred obnoxious to one another, by natural Antipathies framed to keep them in mutual abhorrence, (as if wi&s;e Nature, when &s;he framed but one Man in the beginning, out of who&s;e Loyns all Nations &s;hould proceed, had compo&s;ed him to their very purpo&s;e of incon&s;i&s;tent and un&s;o|ciable Qualities and Materials) which hath been fomented al&s;o by two of the mo&s;t powerful Pa&s;&s;i|ons, Jealou&s;ie and Ambition, the Effects where|of, in &s;undry National Quarrells, have almo&s;t ex|tingui&s;hed both the Combatants.

<P>To get &s;o high, that they may govern and ballance the World, and overlook the Affairs of the Uni|ver&s;e; which Elevation to &s;o tickli&s;h a point of Grandeur and Felicity, as it hath been fancied by &s;ome, is &s;o incapable of per&s;i&s;tency, that the Fate of <HI>Phaeton</HI> hath attended their ambitious De|&s;igns, and ca&s;t their Dominions into Flame and Combu&s;tion.</P>
<P>Not to deny, but that a ju&s;t Temperature of a formidable power and greatne&s;s, ought to be nice|ly regarded, when the vicinity of &s;o many united Dominions and Soveraignties unequally di&s;tribu|ted, may give &s;u&s;picion of Encroachment; but when &s;uch Di&s;cour&s;es are like the &s;tory of 88. an|tiquated, and very unpracticable; and the very Umbrages of tho&s;e things di&s;appear, and are vani|&s;hed, for that the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy, and the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> (who&s;e great acce&s;&s;ions of Territory gave ri&s;e to tho&s;e Ob&s;ervations on which the Policy of the la&s;t Age was founded) are con|cluded to be con&s;umptive, and to &s;tand meerly on the defen&s;ive part; the pre&s;ent divi&s;ions of <HI>Europe</HI> in this unhappy Juncture cannot be palliated or co|vered with this fig-leaf.</P>
<P>As, if the To&s;s of Ambition be in the other Bucket, which in counterpoize of the formers a&s;|piring glories, hath &s;trugled through a War of al|mo&s;t a 100. years duration, but hath now inter|changed Aimes and De&s;ignes by Conver&s;ion, in|tending the &s;elf-&s;ame advantages of a Pur&s;e and Pui&s;&s;ance; the &s;aid Differences are more enviou&s;ly calamitous, and are &s;o far from Colour of Excu&s;e, that they give the World to &s;ee, that they do not
<PB N="5" REF="8">act by the Rule of what they ought, but what they may or can do; and that the longe&s;t Sword hath no mea&s;ure but its Scabbard, to which once drawn, it &s;eldom returns. Such as the&s;e may be the occult cau&s;e of our Differences, (not imputing it to the pre&s;ent War between the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> and the <HI>Pole,</HI> which is an Haereditary and National Quarrell a|bout the Lands of their Dominions, conterminate and confining upon one another; or to &s;ome &s;mall mi&s;-under&s;tandings in <HI>Germany,</HI> not con&s;iderable but for this Juncture, of both which we &s;hall treat in its place more amply) but there is a kind of Evil, which hath attended every grand and happy Revolution in <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> that is a&s;&s;ignable as the principal and general Motion to the&s;e pre&s;ent Troubles.</P>
<P>Fortune was never yet &s;o re&s;pectful and offici|ou&s;ly kind, but that her Train was very chargeable; nor doth &s;he in her greate&s;t Indulgence but fae|nerate and commute her Favours. The late ge|neral Peace was not given <HI>Gratis,</HI> nor tho&s;e <HI>Pal|ladian</HI> Semblances of Accommodation, without armed force in the womb of tho&s;e concealed De|&s;ignes which yet amu&s;e <HI>Chri&s;tendom;</HI> and it is mo&s;t true, that the Pope his Holine&s;s, who, in the beginning of his Papacy, laid about him &s;o much for the Reconciliation of the two Crowns, was not over-plea&s;ed when he &s;aw it was fini&s;hed, and yet not out of any pique with the Cardinal <HI>Mazarine,</HI> (who attributed to him&s;elf the glory of the Affair, by timing it to his own Notes) as hath been &s;uppo|&s;ed, but becau&s;e he prudently fore&s;aw that the over-grown power of that King would be dan|gerous
<PB N="6" REF="9">to the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical State.</P>
<P>So that Peace and War are like Generation and Corruption, they follow one another, naturally and commonly the greater the pacification is, and the more things &s;eem to be &s;tilled and compo&s;ed, the more vehement and violent the rupture; for War is like an Earthquake, pre&s;aged by a &s;erene Sky, and a quiet, gentle Air, &s;ooner than by any other progno&s;tick or &s;ign what&s;oever. And &s;o much le&s;s &s;ufficient is the &s;tate of <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> to provide again&s;t the &s;uddenne&s;s of &s;uch a calamity, for that the &s;cale of Politiques, as was hinted be|fore, is quite altered, and of a different and vari|ous admini&s;tration, the power being circulated to another Corner, and with the Wind may blow where it li&s;t, while the Ea&s;tern Torrent or Inunda|tion carries all before it.</P>
<P>Having thus glanced at the&s;e Cau&s;es which have embroyled <HI>Europe,</HI> we come now to the Effects in the de&s;cription and account thereof for the plain and perfect Elucidation of the premi&s;es; and fir&s;t we con&s;ider <HI>Europe</HI> in General, where we content our &s;elves with the &s;urvey of its Extent and Defini|tion.</P>

<P>This Kings Revenue con&s;i&s;teth in four things, the Tenths of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Livings, Mines, Tri|butes, and Cu&s;tomes. 1.

<PB N="40" REF="28">2. His Mines, a great deal more con|&s;iderable, for that his tenth part of three Copper Works, almo&s;t a hundred years agoe, yielded him 3000.

And tho&s;e Mines may be found in every place, if the Country Peo|ple (bound to carry wood, and do other &s;ervile work there) did not hide and hinder the di&s;co|very. Mo&s;t fine Silver is found in the Province of <HI>Ve&s;tras,</HI> were it not for the envy and jealou&s;ie of the Inhabitants, either murmuring that Strangers &s;hould be employed, or &s;u&s;pecting that they &s;hould be over-reached; &s;o that his Revenue is mightily hindred by this means. 3. But his Taxes do far &s;urpa&s;s all his other Incomes, for he levyeth the Tenth of Rye, Wheat, Barley, Fi&s;h, Skins, Oxen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Of the Tenth of Oxen he hath ga|thered at &s;ome times 18000. Dollars, with all which he maintaineth his Court, Officers, Navy, and Armies. In the time of War with <HI>Dane</HI> or <HI>Mu&s;covite,</HI> his Neighbours, he alloweth his Soul|diers Victuals, which by his Taxes he provideth at ea&s;ie Rates: He giveth them likewi&s;e a Coat or Ca&s;&s;ock every year, which maketh them ever fully ready to obey his Commands. The Marriage of the Kings Daughters is at the di&s;po&s;al of the Senate, who give them for their Portion, be&s;ides Silver, Plate, and other Gifts, a 100000. Dollars. Of the Uplandi&s;h People, which pay not the Impo&s;t of Victuals, the King is accu&s;tomed to exact of e|very Poll acording to his ability, five Dollars or more yearly. 4. His Cu&s;tomes, that are paid in the Haven Towns, the Chief whereof in <HI>Sweden</HI>

<PB N="42" REF="29">that Treaty, were annihilated or retrenched by the &s;ucceeding Agreement, in the <HI>Swedes</HI> Leageur before <HI>Copenhagen,</HI> after their Defeat in the A&s;|&s;ault of that Town, by the Mediation and Guaran|ty of the <HI>Engli&s;h, Dutch,</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;a|dors, in <HI>May</HI> 1660. neverthele&s;s <HI>Schoneland</HI> re|mained to the <HI>Swede,</HI> with &s;ome of the <HI>Baltique</HI> I&s;lands; and other Places, not to be particularized in this Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>All which E&s;tates being laid and joyned together in &s;ome manner, it were &s;uppo&s;able at fir&s;t view, that he might ea&s;ily render him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Baltique</HI> Sea: but when it is again con&s;idered, of what &s;trength the <HI>Dane,</HI> the <HI>Han&s;e</HI> Towns are, as <HI>Lubeck, Hamborough, Dantzick;</HI> together with the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Dutch</HI> in the Trade therein, it will &s;eem a tougher matter, and too big for his Na|val &s;trength, which yet of it &s;elf is very con&s;idera|ble: No doubt the <HI>Swede</HI> hath chawed deliciou&s;ly upon the De&s;ign, but could never dige&s;t it; it &s;ufficeth him at pre&s;ent, that his Ships are Toll free as they pa&s;s the <HI>Sound:</HI> and that he enjoyeth other Priviledges, which the Violence of his Armes have purcha&s;ed him, of the Princes his Neigh|bours.</P>
<P>As to the Force of this Kingdom, it hath been perceived of what Effect and Pui&s;&s;ance it is, by that War it carried on, under the late King <HI>Charles Gu&s;tavus,</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Pole,</HI> the <HI>Dane,</HI> and the <HI>Mu&s;covite,</HI> at one and the &s;ame time: But truly, I cannot tell, whether I may a&s;cribe tho&s;e Numbers of Men, with which they have enterpri&s;ed &s;o much lately, either to the Production of their own

<P>As to the Policy of this Kingdom, having touch|ed before, that the Government is Monarchical, we will briefly de&s;cribe the menage of it: Matters of Peace, and War, of Emba&s;&s;yes, and Allian|ces, are propo&s;ed by the King to the Senate, for their Re&s;olution, which the Senators deliver with an entire Liberty, and mo&s;t Voices carry it: but if it happen, that the Vote be contrary to the Kings purpo&s;es, he will a&s;&s;emble the States Gene|ral, to obtain of them what he cannot of the Se|nate.

<P>The Nobles that &s;it in &s;uch Parliaments, or E&s;tates General, are of the elde&s;t of their Families: the Church &s;ends two Prie&s;ts of every Community or Dioce&s;s, the Cities two Merchants, and every Shire two of its Inhabitants: The&s;e four Bodies

<P>The preceding di&s;cour&s;e leads me to con&s;ider of this Kings Revenue, which chiefly con&s;i&s;ts in his Toll upon Ships afore&s;aid, (for he makes little of his own Cu&s;tomes, Fi&s;h being his greate&s;t Com|modity, and no great Port of Trade in all his Realm) which hath fallen much &s;ince his late Agreement with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who have the &s;ole Trade here almo&s;t; and more by the Northern Pa&s;|&s;age to <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> found out many years &s;ince.

<P>The&s;e were the Originalls of this Republique, and the Fundamental Laws thereof; we will now &s;ee the Practice and Execution of them, in the Ad|mini&s;tration, and the Policy of the Government. 1.

<P>The Provincial Magi&s;tracy is compo&s;ed of a Councellour of every City of the Province, who&s;e Office is to Con&s;erve its Priviledges and Immuni|ties; to this Court there lies an Appeal from the Sentence of the Sheriffs Court.</P>
<P>The Colledge or A&s;&s;embly of the Lords States General, is con&s;tituted of the Deputies of the Pro|vincial Councils; the&s;e make the Alliances, and Treaties, or War with foreign Princes and States; and the&s;e rai&s;e Money, and impo&s;e Taxes, and take the Care of the Peace and well-Being of the Publique. In this A&s;&s;embly, one of the A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, or Pen&s;ionary Coun&s;ellours, opens the Matter or Affair in a proportion, which the Deputies re|ceive, but give no an&s;wer till they have received one from the Provincial Councils, who likewi&s;e mu&s;t be re&s;olved by the re&s;pective Cities, which makes State Bu&s;ine&s;s very tedious, but that's re|compen&s;ed by a good dige&s;tion, and mature deli|beration. So that the Soveraignty re&s;ides not in
<PB N="61" REF="38">the A&s;&s;embly of the States General, although they &s;eem to have all the Power, but in the E&s;tates of every Province, and the Council of the Cities. In effect, the Cities frame their particular Laws, and do their own bu&s;ine&s;s, without communicating it to the States General: But the States General cannot undertake any thing, without fir&s;t writing to the Provinces, and obliging their Negotiation with the Cities, to obtain the permi&s;&s;ion of their Determinations.</P>
<P>The States General meet at the <HI>Hague,</HI> where every Province pre&s;ides weekly; Every Province &s;ends one or more Deputies, who all of them make but one Voice; Each Province takes Place of other in their own Territory, to pre&s;erve Aequa|lity, and their Votes are of the &s;ame Validity: Every Province likewi&s;e Payes its own Deputies, and changeth them once in three years, to make room for others to finger the Government; but they mu&s;t be &s;uch as have De&s;ert and E&s;tates, that they may &s;olely intend the Publique, without De|triment to their private Fortune.</P>
<P>The People are generally good natured to Stran|gers, and free in their Conver&s;e one to another; their Looks very vivacious and plea&s;ant: yet are they wondrous &s;ubtle and prudent, and love in things mo&s;t exce&s;&s;ively <HI>Money</HI> and <HI>Liberty:</HI> But &s;uch the Capricies concerning the latter, that they &s;ute that Character of <HI>Tacitus; Nec po&s;&s;unt Liberta|tem, nec Servitutem pati:</HI> Or that of <HI>Strada,</HI> which comes neare&s;t the matter; <HI>Nulli magis Servitutem execrantur, nulli melius patiuntur;</HI> They can neither endure Servitude nor Freedom: for every man will
<PB N="62" REF="39">take upon him&s;elf to rectifie the pre&s;ent Govern|ment; and in this their Pre&s;&s;es are very &s;candalous. As to the latter, the many mi&s;eries &amp; violences they have done to Trade in all Nations of the World, both by private Men, and publique Commi&s;&s;ion, have made it too notorious; and this Kingdom chiefly feeleth the Mi&s;chief thereof.

By which means, in a few years, if un-interrupted, they will gain all the Wealth in the World into their Hands; which that they drive at, is apparent by tho&s;e va&s;t Fleets they have for a good while maintained in tho&s;e <HI>In|dian</HI> Seas, and tho&s;e Acqui&s;ts they have made by Land there al&s;o; &s;o that they are Formidable to all the Princes of tho&s;e Parts: And it is very Credi|ble, that the repute and dread they have gotten there, is partly obliged to a quantity of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Seamen, whom they have for &s;ome late time em|ployed and &s;hipped upon Voyages to tho&s;e Coa&s;ts, and left them di&s;per&s;ed in Garri&s;ons, contrary to Articles and Agreement made at their Embarquing; by which means they deprive us al&s;o of Seamen. But to proceed.</P>
<P>They have been declared a Free State, and the High and Mighty Lords the States General, ever &s;ince 1648. when the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> wearied with a 80. years War, was more than willing to re|linqui&s;h his Claim, and Regal Title, (being per|plexed

<P>With this gallant Per&s;ons Death, the <HI>Dutch</HI> re&s;o|lution of Fighting changed into milder &amp; humbler thoughts: but &s;ad was the face of this Country, upon the return of their Fleet, &s;o maimed and un|manned; nor did they forbear to deplore this la|mentable lo&s;s, and to demand openly a &s;udden Peace with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> with whom if they were Friends, they would defie the World: And now their Governours were blamed, for commencing &s;uch a de&s;tructive Enterpri&s;e, (and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants, and others, highly carre&s;&s;ed, who &s;ome while before had changed &amp; transferred their Staple from <HI>Rotterdam</HI> to <HI>Dort</HI>) and they terribly threatned, if it were not quickly &s;et an end to, and compo&s;ed, by any manner of Agreement: And yet as &s;oon as it was concluded, they fell pre|&s;ently
<PB N="66" REF="42">to their old Depraedations in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> and have continued them there, and el&s;ewhere, ever &s;ince. So natural it is for the&s;e People to take all advantages for gain; and &s;uch the dilatory proceed|ings of their Courts of Ju&s;tice, and removal from one Chamber of the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company (which are &s;ix in all, <HI>viz.</HI> Of <HI>Am&s;terdam, Delf, Rotterdam, Middleburgh,</HI> &amp;c.) to another, that it is a wor&s;e vexation to pro&s;ecute the recovery, than is the lo&s;s of our Goods; as might be in&s;tanced in the Ca&s;e of tho&s;e intere&s;&s;ed in Squire <HI>Courtens</HI> Ships; (who lo&s;t not only the Ships and Goods, but his Factories al&s;o, the be&s;t and riche&s;t in all the <HI>In|dies,</HI> and ever &s;ince 1643. po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by that means by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> for that Squire <HI>Courten</HI> was thereby wholly deprived of any means to &s;upply them) and this one thing hath proved as great a Damage to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, as any Action of theirs &s;ince <HI>Amboyna.</HI></P>
<P>We have been thus liberal in di&s;cour&s;ing of their Trade, becau&s;e it is the Soul, nay, the be&s;t part of the Body of this little va&s;t Republique; and is the only con&s;iderable thing: For ala&s;s, what are tho&s;e puny Provinces they till and manure, and make Pa&s;ture of, (and much of that torn from their better Parent the Sea) to be compared with tho&s;e va&s;t Regions they po&s;&s;e&s;s abroad? So that <HI>Holland</HI> &s;eems to be the Hive; but the &s;weet Flowers from whence the Honey is gathered, and with which they &s;u&s;tain them&s;elves, are planted in more ble&s;&s;ed Countries.

<PB N="67" REF="42">hereafter it may be &s;aid, if the <HI>Dutch</HI> Trade go on thus, it will give Law to all Trade through|out the World, if it pre&s;ume not al&s;o to the Sword.</P>
<P>And as they are thus careful and indu&s;trious for their profit and glory in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> where they a&s;pire to an univer&s;al Soveraignty, and have already intitled them&s;elves to the Southern Seas: &s;o do they as diligently mind their near Concern in the <HI>Baltique</HI> Sea, and the Trade about the North|ern Cape to <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> of which we had experience in their &s;tickling &s;o between the two Northern Kings, And although they were adventrou&s;ly engaged in that Bu&s;ine&s;s by the <HI>Brandenburger,</HI> their old Con|faederate and Ally by the Hou&s;e of <HI>Orange,</HI> who afterwards left them to their own Councils: yet did they at la&s;t come off hand&s;omely with the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> by the Treaty of <HI>Elbing</HI> 1657. though with great lo&s;s of Money; and afterwards more gloriou&s;ly with him, when, by their a&s;&s;i&s;tance gi|ven the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> 1659. they made the <HI>Swede</HI> to under&s;tand, that He could not be Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Sound</HI> without their leave.

<P>And incredible is the Profit which ari&s;eth by their Trade out of tho&s;e Countries by Corn, (which they di&s;per&s;e into <HI>Europe</HI>) Hemp, Tarr, Cordage, Ma&s;ts, Deal-boards, Clap-boards, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which they have in Exchange for their Spices from
<PB N="68" REF="43"><HI>India;</HI> &s;o that 600.

Now to encourage People to &s;ettle them&s;elves with them, and to carry on their Na|vigation: they give great and equal Priviledges to all Commers; nor are the Duties upon Goods Ex|ported or Imported, any way &s;o con&s;iderable as in other Kingdomes: Be&s;ides, they will not &s;uffer any Corporations, or the Enclo&s;ure of any Trade, but it &s;hall be free for all men, either to Voyage whither they plea&s;e, or to adventure their Money on the joynt Stock, that menageth that Employ|ment, without any di&s;tinction or difference what|&s;oever; which cour&s;es, with their Toleration of all Religions, have made them &s;o thrive in this manner, and to be &s;o Populous as they are at this day.</P>
<P>We come now to &s;peak of their Forces, and their pre&s;ent Po&s;ture, which is chiefly Naval, as may be concluded from the fore-going di&s;cour&s;e; and that Naval Power &s;uppo&s;ed to be greater and better now than e're it was, &s;o that they can arm and man 200. Ships of War built for &s;ervice in a very &s;hort time, and upon a &s;udden alarum, but we will leave that to time. Certainly they are well provided, but it is as much certain, they care not for a War, e&s;pecially with the <HI>Engl&s;h,</HI> it being &s;o contrary to their Intere&s;t, that every Cabbin Boy will not endure to hear of it. He that reads their
<PB N="69" REF="43">Books Printed upon this &s;ubject, will perceive as much, together, with what fine Artifices they have contrived to flur their Mi&s;demeanours, and compound them under-hand by Friends; and this is avowedly laid down, as a method to Satisfaction beyond all Compari&s;on: And then their Tempori|zing, and peremptory Promi&s;es, is another Shift, which may chance to help them to better Oppor|tunities. At this pre&s;ent they a&s;&s;ure the King of giving him Content, and have promi&s;ed him to call a General A&s;&s;embly of the E&s;tates to that pur|po&s;e: And by an expre&s;s Envoy, have intreated his Maje&s;ty, to take off the Quarantayn or Demoorage upon their Ships, by rea&s;on of the Plague; but there's more &s;tiffne&s;s in the wind.</P>
<P>As to their Land Forces, they alwayes keep up a &s;tanding Militia, both for fear of the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> their near Neighbour, and for all Emergencies at home; but of late they have reduced it to a le&s;s number than formerly; notwith&s;tanding, it is &s;uf|ficient for Defence, and for any &s;udden Employ|ment; and if they want upon any Rupture, their Money will rai&s;e them Souldiers: but the great Armies they maintained under the Princes of <HI>Au|range,</HI> for the gaining of one Town in a Summer, makes 'um now very par&s;imonious.</P>
<P>They are now in firm League both with <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> and all the other Princes of <HI>Chri&s;ten|dom,</HI> (excepting &s;ome Piques in <HI>Ea&s;t-Friezland,</HI> about the <HI>Eyler Sconce,</HI> with the Earl thereof, which Prince <HI>William,</HI> by their order, be&s;ieged, and had it yielded, during a Treaty above) &s;o that they have lei&s;ure (if they mean to be hone&s;t with Us)

<P>And indeed, there are no People &s;o engaged to a&s;&s;i&s;t again&s;t this Enemy, as the&s;e, e&s;pecially by Sea, where they them&s;elves have made them thus powerful to do mi&s;chief, by yielding their Ships to them without &s;triking one blow, (which, by the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Cu&s;tom, gives Liberty to the Mar|riners, upon &s;uch innocent and &s;peedy rendition) which Ships have formerly &s;erved for the Piratical Trade, till with tho&s;e they took better of theirs, and &s;o framed their Modules. They have now a Fleet, under <HI>De Ruyter,</HI> preparing to &s;et &s;ail for <HI>Algier,</HI> but upon no other account, than to re|pre&s;s their In&s;olencies; not intending to give any offence to the <HI>Grand Seigniour,</HI> who&s;e Coa&s;ts and Maritime Places, a Conjunction of the Chri&s;tian Fleets now hovering in the Streights, would quick|ly reduce, and do him thereby a great deal of mi&s;|chief, if the War were pro&s;ecuted; otherwi&s;e it we e labour and time lo&s;t.

<P>As to the Sea, there is a nece&s;&s;ity of a firm Cor|re&s;pondence with the <HI>Han&s;e</HI> Towns, not in point of Commerce, for they grudge them any &s;ociety in it, but out of &s;ecurity to their own, in Ca&s;e of a Rupture; for by their entitling them&s;elves to <HI>Lubeck</HI> and <HI>Hamburg,</HI> and the like Places, in

<P>The&s;e 14.

To give the Peo|ple their due, (whether it is, that that Inqui&s;iti|on hath awed them to it) they are very devout and zealous, and mo&s;t Loyal to their Prince, whom they will &s;pare no blood nor trea&s;ure to aggran|dize, and of whom they never &s;peak without great reverence and honour, and in his &s;ervice, no men can po&s;&s;ibly be more patient, or endure more mi|&s;ery and hardne&s;s, than will they, even to the ut|mo&s;t and wor&s;t of Extremity; and as faithful and

Generally of them|&s;elves, they are very grave and &s;erious in all their Actions, and yet notwith&s;tanding &s;o addicted to Pride, that they think all the World pittiful Fel|lows and Fools, in compari&s;on of them&s;elves.

<P>The Government is Ab&s;olute and Royal, Mat|ters of &s;everal qualities are handled in &s;everal Councils, and they are &s;even in number; which, that the King may be the better informed of all Af|fairs, they keep alwayes near about his Per&s;on, in &s;everal Chambers under one Roof; their Names are the&s;e, The Council of <HI>Spain.</HI> 2.

<P>The ill Corre&s;pondency that is alwayes among&s;t tho&s;e Coun&s;ellours, who aemulate one anothers greatne&s;s, is the Cau&s;e of long Deliberations and Slackne&s;s in Matters of greate&s;t Importance; but all Matters once re&s;olved on in Council, pa&s;s in|differently, with incredible and &s;urpa&s;&s;ing &s;ecrecy, as well tho&s;e of mean, as tho&s;e of the weightie&s;t Con&s;ideration.

<P>In this point, <HI>Philip</HI> the 2d. of <HI>Spain,</HI> the a|ble&s;t Prince of his time, was very tenacious, do|ing many things with his own hand, which never came near his Secretaries, but were tran&s;mitted by him&s;elf uncopied (but what he took likewi&s;e him&s;elf) to his Expre&s;&s;es and Di&s;patches.

<P>This Prince hath been embroyled in the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>French</HI> War all along again&s;t his Inclination, which is otherwi&s;e di&s;po&s;ed, for he loves quiet and plea&s;ure, and vacancy from tho&s;e troubles of Empire which afflict ambitious People; and it is

<P>As to the Forces of this Kingdom, the &s;ame may be &s;aid of them as of the Bees; <HI>Quae Regio in terris no&s;tri non plena laboris:</HI> There is no Nation in <HI>Europe,</HI> but the remote Northern Kingdomes, that have not felt the Pui&s;&s;ance thereof; and it is well known, that in all ages, the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> have been accounted one of the mo&s;t Valorous Nations in the World. The <HI>French</HI> in nine Years were &s;ub|dued to the <HI>Roman</HI> Yoak, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> held out 200. and then too, the Fortune and Per&s;on of <HI>Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar,</HI> the Univer&s;al Conquerour, was requi&s;ite to their Subjugation.

As concerning their Cavalry, it cannot be gain-&s;aid, but that the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Gennet is the noble&s;t Hor&s;e in <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> far excelling the Cour&s;er of <HI>Na|ples,</HI> or the Hor&s;e of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> &s;o much e&s;teem|ed of the <HI>French;</HI> or the <HI>Frie&s;land</HI> Hor&s;e, in &s;o

To conclude, as to the number of the Forces afore&s;aid, this Prince is of that Mightine&s;s and Reputation to this day, that, be&s;ides his own Subjects, he is able to wage what numbers of Hor&s;emen and Footmen of the <HI>Ger|mans, Italian,</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Nations it plea&s;eth him; be&s;ides, his Noblemen are bound to bring &s;o ma|ny Hor&s;e into the Field, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And he that re|members how the War was carried on in <HI>Catalonia, Portugal, Italy,</HI> and the <HI>Low Countries</HI> together, cannot but re&s;olve, that his Pui&s;&s;ance is mo&s;t con|&s;iderable. At all times his Maje&s;ty is likewi&s;e con&s;trained to maintain a &s;trong <HI>Armada</HI> in the&s;e Seas, to &s;afeguard the Navigation to the <HI>Indies;</HI> be&s;ides 24.

There are be&s;ides 8000. prae&s;idiary Souldiers, and no more, in the Frontier, and Coa&s;t Towns of <HI>Spain,</HI> the Charge whereof I &s;aw not com|puted.</P>
<P>As to the Revenue of this Potentate, the ordi|nary Income thereof amounts to &s;ix Millions of Gold, or 11. Millions of Crowns yearly, where|of much is engaged for the Debts of the Crown, the re&s;t is &s;pent in Charges of the Wars, the main|tenance of the Kings Hou&s;hold, and in the Gallies furni&s;hed again&s;t the <HI>Barbary</HI> Pirates. To this may be added, as another ordinary Revenue, the two Millions of Crowns which he receives yearly of the
<PB N="108" REF="64">Clergy, together with the Commendams of vacant Prae&s;entations, and the praeferring to Benefices. The whole Revenues of the Clergy are valued at &s;ix Millions of Gold yearly Rent, there being 34. Cathedral Churches, all richly endowed, &s;ome whereof having 50. &s;ome a 100. and &s;ome 200. Millions of yearly Revenue, and in particular, the Metropolitan Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Toledo</HI> hath more than 300. Millions: Neither do the Kings of <HI>Spain</HI> care to parcel the&s;e Churches to a greater number, although over-grown with their plenty, for then they &s;hould with more difficulty make u&s;e of the Revenues and Notes thereof, when occa&s;i|on required, which is very often, upon any di&s;a|&s;trous Event. As he likewi&s;e layes extraordinary Taxes upon the Laity in the like Occurrence, for in the Kingdom of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> alone, <HI>Philip</HI> the 2d. had nigh 8.

<P>This Princes Coyn notwith&s;tanding is the be&s;t in <HI>Europe,</HI> &s;ince all their Neighbours make a gain of them, as a Piece of Reals, or 8.

All their Meat, Fruit and Bread, are &s;old by the Pound, and not except before an Officer, which they call <HI>Alcalda,</HI> &s;o that no Stranger can be deceived in price or weight.</P>
<P>As to the Intere&s;t of the&s;e Princes, it hath been evidently &s;een what it hath been; but &s;ince the <HI>French</HI> mated them under <HI>Francis</HI> the Fir&s;t, and held them to it, till <HI>Lewis</HI> the 14th. was too powerful for them; &s;ince the <HI>Dutch</HI> baffled them, and We triumphed over them, they have been put to defend their own, in&s;tead of over-running others. Their De&s;ignes are now to &s;ecure their E&s;tates, and to draw from them that Revenue into their Coffers, which was &s;quandred away in the War, without any account; and yet to be as gen|tle a Soveraign as po&s;&s;ible. For all the late League, the <HI>Spaniard</HI> nor <HI>French</HI> will ever joyn Intere&s;ts, or agree together, more than they do in their Hu|mours or Fa&s;hions. In fine, they really hate one another, but more revengefully the <HI>Spaniard</HI> frets at the <HI>French,</HI> as he that fir&s;t put a &s;top to his Career of Ambition; and therefore there's no|thing but Jealou&s;ie and Su&s;pition between them, however &s;moothed and oyled over with Court Ar|tifices, alike under&s;tood for &s;uch on both &s;ides; nor have their late frequent Con&s;anguinities and Marriages any influences to draw them nearer to a|ny amicable under&s;tanding.</P>

<P>With the <HI>Dutch</HI> he firmly keeps a good Corre&s;+pondence, as his very good Friends, &s;ince Fate would needs have it &s;o, and u&s;eth them very re|&s;pectfully, as his good Neighbours, and as &s;ecuri|ty to his E&s;tates in <HI>Flanders;</HI> for the <HI>Dutch,</HI> as was &s;aid, do not love the <HI>Frenchmens</HI> vicinity.

With the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> he is newly reconciled, and certainly that Duke (who hath the Citadel of <HI>Verceil</HI> re&s;tored him by this King, by vertue of the late Treaty) hath no great Antipathy again&s;t Him, for he hath &s;uffered twice more from the <HI>French,</HI> than from the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> who is as well able to Defend Him, as he is con|veniently &s;cited to Offend him upon every di&s;plea|&s;ure. The Duke of <HI>Parma</HI> is allyed to him, and &s;o &s;ure to his Intere&s;t. The <HI>Florentine</HI> is &s;tiff, but is aequal between the <HI>French</HI> and Him. The <HI>Mantuan</HI> will be Neutral; and the Pope his &s;ecret Friend. The Prince of <HI>Modena</HI> will hardly en|gage any more again&s;t Him, for in a manner he is the Umpire of all Quarrells between tho&s;e Prin|ces. He is Patron al&s;o to the Common-Wealth of <HI>Luca.</HI> And for the States of <HI>Venice,</HI> ever &s;ince the Dutchy of <HI>Millain</HI> came to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this Crown, they have &s;et them down with great quietne&s;s, rather looking to the &s;trengthening of their own, than attempting his; and good rea&s;on too, for our Ance&s;tors have &s;een the <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> favouring the <HI>Venetians,</HI> (when their E&s;tate was
<PB N="111" REF="65">dangerou&s;ly hazarded by the <HI>Turk</HI>) chearfully to have entred into the Actions of <HI>Cephalonia</HI> and <HI>Le|panto,</HI> when neverthele&s;s at the &s;ame in&s;tant they had at their own Doors <HI>Algier, Tunis,</HI> and other <HI>African</HI> Ports, their dangerous Enemies. The State of <HI>Genoa</HI> mu&s;t favour the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and &s;tand by him, for he is their Protector, and owes them va&s;t &s;umms, which by any partiality of their &s;ide will be wholly lo&s;t. With all the Catholique Princes of <HI>Germany</HI> he is in perfect Corre&s;pon|dence, and how great a relation and nece&s;&s;ity of mutual adhaerence there is between the Emperour and Him, no man is ignorant, confirmed now, and more intimately contracted by the late Marriage of the Infanta. With the King of <HI>Fez</HI> and <HI>Morocco</HI> his Catholique Maje&s;ty is in League, but it is of no u&s;e or availment to him. Of the Religion of <HI>Malta</HI> the King taketh a particular protection, as that in like &s;ort depends wholly upon his plea&s;ure, and doth readily execute his Royal Commandements, &s;erving him often in keeping the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Spain,</HI> and the Kingdomes of <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Sicily</HI> from Incur&s;ions of Pyrates, and that without one penny co&s;t or charges to the King.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Turk,</HI> he maintains no intercour&s;e, nor u&s;eth any Trade with him, and yet he hath neither Peace nor War with him; Peace he pre|tends he ought not to have, and the other he ca|reth not for; and the <HI>Turk</HI> is as unwilling to quar|rel as he, remembring what he &s;uffered from him at <HI>Lepanto:</HI> So that pivate Damages are privately made good, and the <HI>Algier</HI> men do take upon them&s;elves the Rupture, if any louder Mi&s;chief
<PB N="112" REF="66">happen, of which the <HI>Spaniard</HI> will not complain. It is thought that this King is Superiour to the <HI>Turk</HI> in Naval Furniture and Provi&s;ion, and the Cou|rage and Ability of Seamen, for his <HI>Biskayners</HI> and <HI>Catalonians</HI> are hardly to be paralleled for enduring of Winter weather and Tempe&s;ts: and the <HI>Turk</HI> is alwayes moared at home from <HI>October</HI> to <HI>March;</HI> be&s;ides the convenience of his Coa&s;t for building of Ships and Gallies, of which he hath a 100. in readine&s;s: and the <HI>Turk</HI> hath but two Places all a|long his <HI>African</HI> Coa&s;t, <HI>viz. Algier</HI> and <HI>Tunis,</HI> where he can build a Ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>Upon this account it was, that <HI>Philip</HI> the 2d. was advi&s;ed to &s;eize upon the <HI>Morea</HI> and <HI>Greece,</HI> tho&s;e People being willing to embrace a Chri&s;tian Defender again&s;t that un&s;upportable &s;lavery which they &s;uffer from the <HI>Turk;</HI> but he con&s;idering his Fathers ill &s;ucce&s;s in <HI>Africa,</HI> (though a&s;cribable more to Tempe&s;t, than to any other Cau&s;e) would never ca&s;t his eye upon that Enterprize, being bent upon far wor&s;e, to the di&s;turbance of <HI>Chri|&s;tendom;</HI> &s;o that it appears, he is the only Prince, that is able to give him a Potent Diver&s;ion, were not his Fleets otherwi&s;e employed.</P>
<P>But withall, this King at pre&s;ent is &s;o exhau&s;t|ed, that he is not in a Capacity to undertake &s;uch an Expedition, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of other Chri&s;tian Princes, which the <HI>Venetians</HI> have a long while in vain implored, and he cannot hope to ex|pect it till the danger is more eminent, and then hee'l find wayes to defend him&s;elf: This may be certainly concluded on, he will do what in him ly|eth, to keep the <HI>Turk</HI> from &s;wallowing the Haere|ditary

It is in circuit about 2. <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Miles, very &s;trong both by Nature and Art, as well for that it is &s;eated on a Hill, which on the We&s;t is not ea&s;ily acce&s;&s;ible, as al&s;o for that it is exceedingly well fortified with Ravelings, Bulwarks, and Platforms, be&s;ides a deep Ditch, the Ea&s;t and We&s;t parts thereof &s;tanding continually full of water, the South part remains dry continually, and is well defended with Ca&s;emates, the better to &s;cour the Curtayn.
<PB N="118" REF="69">The Town is &s;o much the &s;tronger, for that it tandeth almo&s;t in an I&s;land, having the Lake a|fore&s;aid on the North, the River <HI>Rho&s;ne</HI> upon the We&s;t, and the River of <HI>Arba</HI> upon the South, be|ing from the Town half a mile, and by rea&s;on of the &s;wiftne&s;s of the Current, and great moveable Stones in the bottom, which are violently carried down, the River is not pa&s;&s;able, but with great dan|ger.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Rho&s;ne</HI> divideth the Town into 2. parts, the one is called the <HI>High Town,</HI> and the other St. <HI>Gervais.</HI> It is well peopled, &s;ome 20000. of all &s;orts.

<P>The Revenue of this Town is &s;ome 100000.

The Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> pretends a Title to this Town, as governed before the Reformation by a Catholique Bi&s;hop, who being Lord thereof, as his temporal E&s;tate, did homage for it to the &s;aid Duke; that the Mo|ney the Bi&s;hop coyned bore his In&s;cription; that the Dukes of <HI>Savoy</HI> had alwayes an Office there, without acquaintance of which no &s;entence of Law could be executed; that the power of pardoning Offenders remained in the &s;aid Dukes. But the <HI>Genevois</HI> turn a deaf Ear to tho&s;e Preten&s;ions, but do therefore bear him a perpetual grudge, and hate him wor&s;e than all their Neighbours; nor do they much fear him, for neither the <HI>French,</HI> nor <HI>Spaniard,</HI> nor any of the Princes of <HI>Italy,</HI> will &s;uffer him, or he, or they &s;uffer one another, to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of this &s;trong, commodious, and mo&s;t convenient Fortre&s;s.

<P>They were once under the Government of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> as Earls of <HI>Halspurg,</HI> the Ca&s;tle whereof is &s;tanding in this Country, which gave Original and Title to that Family, but ri&s;ing for their Liberty, provoked by the Rape of one of their Daughters, they, by 2. terrible Defeats given the <HI>Au&s;trians,</HI> &s;hook off their Yoak; and immediately 3.

<P>Their Exemption of them&s;elves in this manner from the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> made them notable in the World, which they were not &s;ince <HI>Julius Cae|&s;ar;</HI> but their defeat and &s;laughter of <HI>Charles</HI>

<P>Their Revenue is very incon&s;iderable, for having no Commerce with Strangers, they have no Cu&s;tomes, nor have they any Manufactures. Cutlery is a great Trade.

<P>As to their Force, it far excceds their Revenue, for upon occa&s;ion, they can bring 30. thou&s;and Foot into the Field, be&s;ides what the confederate Cities will add thereunto: As for Hor&s;e, they are of no u&s;e in tho&s;e hilly Countries, nor a quar|ter of the number of the Foot, to defend a Region &s;o impregnable; and they have no ambition, as we have mentioned before, of invading others.

<P><HI>England</HI> now, as of old, the Ballance of <HI>Eu|rope;</HI> giving Law, with its Armes, to <HI>Africa,</HI> and its Princes; opening the way, by its Com|merce, to the Wines and Sugars of <HI>Spain,</HI> to the Trea&s;ure of the <HI>Indies,</HI> to the Manufactures of <HI>Turkey,</HI> and <HI>China;</HI> to the Cordage, and Naval Materials of <HI>Mu&s;covy, Sweden,</HI> and <HI>Denmark;</HI> to the Delicacies of <HI>Italy,</HI> to the Ker&s;ies of <HI>Flan|ders,</HI> to the Wines of <HI>Burdeaux;</HI> and whatever owneth the Name of <HI>Nece&s;&s;ary</HI> or <HI>Convenient.</HI> Improving its Native Commodities with the great|e&s;t Art at home, and Exporting them with the highe&s;t Freedom abroad.</P>
<P>Its Fir&s;t Intere&s;t is Intelligence and Negotiation; and the World under&s;tands, how Active a Per&s;on it employes in <HI>Holland,</HI> how Wi&s;e a Man it hath &s;et|led in <HI>France,</HI> how Grave an Amba&s;&s;adour it main|tains in <HI>Spain;</HI> and what Re&s;erved, Prudent, and Noble Agents, it hath di&s;patched to <HI>Denmark</HI> and <HI>Sweden;</HI> not to mention the Honourable Per&s;on re|&s;ident at the <HI>Grand Seigniour</HI>'s Court.</P>
<P>Its Second is Trade, and the Dominion of the Sea; and it's not unknown, what Expert Captains are tru&s;ted, what Multitudes of Seamen are bred up, what Provi&s;ions are made for Fi&s;hing, what Laws are in force for the Vending of Fi&s;h, what Corre&s;pondence is kept with the Northern Coa&s;ts for Cordage, how many and &s;trong Ve&s;&s;els are built; what Stores and Magazines, even beyond what ever was known, are &s;et up; how ble&s;&s;ed a Prince, who makes it his bu&s;ine&s;s to under&s;tand and manage the Sea Affairs; how Royal an Admiral, the King's only Brother; what Noble Officers, all
<PB N="254" REF="140">the Nobility, choo&s;ing rather a Ship at Sea, than a Court by Land; how willing the Kingdom is to float upon the Sea, how watchful the Commi&s;|&s;ioners of the Navy are to guide it, and how vigi|lant His Maje&s;ty, and his Honourable Council is upon all; what formidable Preparations, what a|bundance of gallant Men, what skillful Buil|ders, what expert Seamen, what valiant Com|manders; and, in a word, what a brave Admiral, who&s;e conduct, diligence, and &s;ucce&s;s, is known to the World.</P>
<P>Its Third Intere&s;t is the Prote&s;tant Religion, which it encourageth abroad, and hath &s;etled at home; where the Laws again&s;t Recu&s;ants of both &s;ides, the Papi&s;ts, and the Separati&s;t, are very &s;trict; the Uniformity di&s;tinct from them both, is very orderly; Our Doctrine, how confe&s;&s;edly Or|thodox; Our Devotion, how avowedly whole|&s;ome; Our Ceremonies, how famou&s;ly decent; Our Di&s;cipline, how admirably primitive; and our Order, how honourably antient! Our Peo|ple &s;ubmitting humbly to their Guides, they to their Over&s;eers, they to their Soveraign, and all to the Word of God, the confe&s;&s;ed general Coun|cils, and the primitive practice. Mini&s;ters are re&s;tored to their Right, and Bi&s;hops to their Pow|er, Juri&s;dictions are e&s;tabli&s;hed, Courts are o|pened, a Terrour hangs over evill doers, and En|couragements are &s;et before tho&s;e that do well: Favours are derived to merit, and Preferments to worth; and a man may be as good as he will, and as great as he de&s;erveth. The Honour of Religi|on, and its Clergy, is a&s;&s;erted; the Levity and Pe|tulancy
<PB N="255" REF="140">of the Populacy is re&s;trained; and every one knoweth his own place, where they &s;erve one God, in one Faith, by one Bapti&s;m, in one Spirit, in one hope of one common Salvation.</P>
<P>Its Fourth Intere&s;t is Unity, the Head whereof is an excellent Prince, made up of power and &s;weetne&s;s, who is feared and loved, who&s;e Veins &s;well with all the Royal Blood of this Kingdom, and who&s;e Soul is thronged with all the Virtues of its Kings; &s;o that his Right is as undoubted as his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and his Merit as his Right: And the awe upon all men ari&s;ing from the three Wonders of his E&s;cape 1651. His Re&s;tauration 1660. and his Succe&s;s ever &s;ince. Great is our happine&s;s in him, multiplyed it is in Relations, <HI>Uno avul&s;o non deficit alter Aureus:</HI> On his Throne he &s;its, with a Gracious Queen on his right hand, his Ex|cellent Mother before him, his Royal Brother on his left hand, his Grave and Honourable Council at his Feet, his Reverend Bi&s;hops about his Throne, his Loyal Nobility near his Per&s;on, his Unanimous Gentry attending his Plea&s;ure, and that Augu&s;t Council, called a Parliament, made up of all the&s;e, as one man, reconciling his Preroga|tive, and his Peoples Liberties, to the Envy of mo&s;t Neighbours, and the Amazement of all. Look we into their Debates, they are dutiful: in|to their Coun&s;ells, they are rational, loyal, and re&s;olute; into their Expedients, they are &s;ea&s;on|able; into their Supplyes, they are honourable; and into their Unanimity, and, as one man, they are re&s;olved to live and dye with their dear and dread Soveraign.</P>

<P>If we return to the Court, it's full, thrifty, wary, and &s;trict. If to the Exchequer, it's full, with a Revenue, double that of former Kings, 1200000 <HI>l. per Annum;</HI> be&s;ides the Re&s;olution of the People, to &s;pend their Lives and Fortunes, for the defence and honour of the King, and in him, of the Kingdom, and them&s;elves. If to the Courts of Ju&s;tice, they are filled with mo&s;t rever|end and famous Men. If to the Church, it's full of venerable, learned, and prudent Churchmen. If to the Officers of State, they are honourable and experienced. If to the Cabals, there was never Prince, or Council, &s;ince the Con&s;titution of Empires, a &s;afer Pre&s;erver of &s;ecrets; and yet none, who&s;e &s;ecrecy and &s;ilence we le&s;s may fear; where the chief Prelates ca&s;t Reverence, and the chief Nobility, of both Kingdoms, Dignity; and all knowing in Forein Affairs abroad, and Dome|&s;tique Con&s;titutions at home. If into the Church, Di&s;putations are &s;ilenced, Pulpits are mode&s;t, Pre&s;&s;es are regulated, Learning is encouraged, Debauchery is di&s;countenanced, Faction is &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed, and Schi&s;m is made ridiculous. If into the City, the Lord Mayor, and Major General, are active and vigilant; the Aldermen, and Com|mon Council, are liberal and free (200000 <HI>l.</HI> at at time) the Companies, Officers, and Ve&s;tries, are &s;etled. If into the Country, the Forts, Strong Holds, and Havens, are &s;ecure; the Militia is &s;etled, and reduced to excellent Rules, for the ea&s;e and &s;ervice of the Country; the Lords Lieu|tenants, and their Deputies, are powerful and ho|ne&s;t, made up of the choice&s;t Gentry; the Sheriffs,
<PB REF="141">that command the Power of the Country, faithful, and well affected; the Ju&s;tices of Peace, Men of E&s;tates, Wi&s;dom, Intere&s;t, Repute, and known Integrity: who execute Ju&s;tice, regulate Di&s;orders, di&s;cover Plots, di|&s;per&s;e Conventicles, promote the honour and &s;ecurity of the Kingdom: and the&s;e hold, <HI>&s;ome</HI> their E&s;tates, <HI>o|thers</HI> their Places, and <HI>all</HI> their Honour, of his Maje&s;ty; under whom Tillage and Husbandry pro&s;pereth, Ma|nufactures are encouraged, Native Commodities are promoted, all People are employed in the Nece&s;&s;ities or Conveniencies of the Kingdom, every man under his own <HI>Vine,</HI> every one under his own <HI>Figtree.</HI> If we look back upon the Pretences, Methods, or Principles, of the former Rebellion, they are cut off by Acts of Par|liament.
