<HEAD>To the Reader</HEAD>
<P>THe occa&s;ion of my undertaking what is here pre&s;en|ted, was a letter which I received from a worthy per&s;on, who upon the peru&s;al of that <HI>brief hi&s;torical Account</HI> of the war with the Indians in <HI>New England,</HI> publi&s;hed the la&s;t &s;ummer, importuned me to write the &s;tory of the <HI>Pequot War;</HI> Taking his motion into con&s;ideration, it came into my thoughts, that it would be a &s;ervice and benefit for po|&s;terity, if all other general troubles which have happened by the <HI>Heathen</HI> in this land, were recorded and made known; &amp; the rather, in that as to tho&s;e <HI>fir&s;t motions and commotions</HI> there are very few that know any thing of them. Wherefore I &s;et my &s;elf to make enquiry into tho&s;e matters, and &s;hall for the &s;a|ti&s;faction of the <HI>Reader,</HI> give him an account where and from whence I obtained, what light and information touching the&s;e <HI>Indian troubles,</HI> I have been any wayes able to arrive unto.</P>
<P>Such Books as I had by me, that relate any thing of the&s;e affaires J have been willing to revolve. e.g. <HI>Johannes de Laet</HI> his <HI>De&s;cription of America,</HI> written in Latin; Al&s;o &s;everal of Cpt. <HI>Smith</HI> his books; And <HI>a relation of the di&s;covery of New England,</HI> publi&s;hed by the Pre&s;ident and Council of <HI>New England.</HI> Anno 1622. And the <HI>Relation or journal of the fir&s;t planters in Plymouth</HI> together with &s;everal letters which &s;ome of them wrote to <HI>Eng|land,</HI> &s;oon after their fir&s;t coming into this countrey; and Mr. <HI>Win&s;low</HI> (then whom hardly any one that hath de&s;erved more e|minently from New England) his <HI>good news from New England,</HI>
<PB REF="3"> publi&s;hed Anno 1624. which relations are in the hands of but few in this countrey, &amp; therefore I have been the larger in excerping things out of them. They are epitomized in <HI>Purcha&s;e</HI> his <HI>Pil|grims</HI> lib. 10. who declares that he had by him a de&s;cription of the voiage made by Capt. <HI>Hanham</HI> to <HI>Sagaedehoc,</HI> and the writ|ten journals of Mr. <HI>Raleigh Gilbert,</HI> and of Mr. <HI>Harly,</HI> &amp; Capt <HI>Hob&s;on,</HI> who were in this land before any Engli&s;h plantation was &s;etled therein. I doubt not but in tho&s;e &s;cripts a more full and particular account is given, of the <HI>fir&s;t concerns</HI> with the <HI>In|dians</HI> here. But I could not come by the fight of them, nor do I know certainly whether tho&s;e things are extant. I have al&s;o peru&s;ed Sr. <HI>Ferdinando Gorges</HI> narration of original undertak|ings here. Moreover J have read a large Manu&s;cript of Gover|nour <HI>Bradfords</HI> (written with his own hand,) being expre&s;&s;ive of what the <HI>fir&s;t planters</HI> in this countrey met with, whether from the <HI>Heathen</HI> or otherwi&s;e, from the year 1620. to the year 1647. As for the <HI>Pequot troubles,</HI> the world is beholding to the indu&s;try of Mr. <HI>John Allyn</HI> of <HI>Hartford</HI> (as is in the &s;ub&s;equent <HI>Relation</HI> acknowledged) for what is thus made publick, re&s;pect|ing the great Commotions which then happened. Only I have been willing to ad &s;ome particulars out of a <HI>manu&s;cript narrative</HI> of the <HI>Pequot war,</HI> which I lately met with in Reverend Mr. <HI>Da|venports</HI> library, as al&s;o what Mr. <HI>John&s;on,</HI> or Mr. <HI>Morton</HI> (out of Mr. <HI>Bradfords</HI> manu&s;cript) hath heretofore noted. Touching the <HI>Narragan&s;ets;</HI> I have &s;earched the publick Records of the Colonyes, and from thence excerped the &s;ub&s;tance of what as here related, as to former troubles from them, or by their means procured. The <HI>Relation</HI> concerning <HI>Alexander</HI> and his brother <HI>Philip,</HI> wherewith this <HI>Narrative</HI> is concluded, I recei|ved from the pre&s;ent Honourable Governour of <HI>Plymouth</HI> (who &s;ucceeds his ble&s;&s;ed Father, as in place, &s;o in &s;pirit) and from the faithful <HI>Secretary</HI> of that Colony. I am &s;en&s;ible that there is a rea|lity in that which <HI>Era&s;mus</HI> doth (after his manner) wittily expre&s;s <HI>Ade&ograve; nunc in omnes et omnia gra&s;&s;atur comitata furiis</HI> <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF"> <HI>ut non &s;it tutum ullum emittere librum, ni&s;i &s;atellitio munitum;</HI> where|fore
<PB REF="3"> I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to give this particular account of the Authors from whom I received my information, re&s;pecting pa&s;&s;ages in&s;i&s;ted on. Nor &s;hall I &s;eek for any other <HI>Guard</HI> again&s;t tho&s;e, who&s;e <HI>Genius</HI> is to calumniate endeavours of this kind.</P>
<P>I am not altogether ignorant of what is commonly and tru|ly ob&s;erved, <HI>viz.</HI> That tho&s;e <HI>Hi&s;tories</HI> which are partly <HI>Chrono|logical</HI> are the mo&s;t profitable; and that they that undertake a work of this nature, &s;hould go by the pre&s;cript of that &s;o much celebrated ver&s;e,</P>
<P><HI>Quis, Quid, &V;bi, Quibus auxiliis, Cur, Quomed&ograve;, Quand&ograve;.</HI> which I have endeavoured to remember. Nor hath that max|im been wholly forgotten, <HI>Stylus Hi&s;toricus quo &s;implicior eo me|lior.</HI> And J may expect that <HI>Ingenuous Readers</HI> will act accor|ding to that which a Learned man in his <HI>Hi&s;torica</HI> layeth down as a <HI>Theorem, Hi&s;torici legantur cum moderatione et venia,</HI> h. e. <HI>cogitetur fieri non po&s;se ut in omnibus circum&s;tantiis &s;int Lyncei.</HI> J have done what I could to come at the truth, and plainly to de|clare it, knowing that that is (as u&s;eth to be &s;aid) <HI>the &s;oul and &s;un of Hi&s;tory,</HI> who&s;e property is, <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">.</P>
<P>As for what concerns the Story of the late war with the Indi|ans, there are who have propounded, that &s;ome meet per&s;ons might be improved in the &s;everal <HI>Colonyes,</HI> to collect what of moment hath happened in each <HI>Colony</HI> &s;ince this war broke forth. When <HI>Ca&s;siodorus</HI> compiled an <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> out of the Col|lections of <HI>Socrates, Theodoret, Sozomen,</HI> it was of great u&s;e in af|ter ages, bearing the name of <HI>Hi&s;toria Tripartita;</HI> if &s;uch a cour&s;e as hath been intimated &s;hould be attended, and the de&s;igne fini|&s;hed, a <HI>Compleat Hi&s;tory</HI> may (<GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">.) be com|po&s;ed out of tho&s;e collections, which J know not but that it may de&s;erve the name of <HI>Hi&s;toria Tripartita,</HI> and be no le&s;&s;e be|neficial to po&s;terity, then &s;ome others have been. In the mean time, the Reader mu&s;t be &s;ati&s;fied with what is already extant.</P>
<P>This following <HI>Relation</HI> was written neer upon a year ago; &s;ince which a Reverend Author hath emitted a Narrative of the
<PB REF="4"> troubles which have happened by the Indians in New England, who&s;e pains and indu&s;try doth (in my judgment) de&s;erve acknow+ledgment. Neverthele&s;&s;e it hath been thought needfull to pub|li&s;h this; Con&s;idering that mo&s;t of the things here in&s;i&s;ted on, are not &s;o much as once taken notice of in that <HI>Narrative.</HI> And although the <HI>Pequot war</HI> be therein de&s;cribed (and that, as to the &s;ub&s;tance of the &s;tory, truely and impartially) it is not &s;o fully done as is here to be &s;een. If this endeavour &s;hall contribute a|ny light or help in writing an <HI>Hi&s;tory of New England,</HI> I hope they who&s;e hearts are upon &s;eeking out and declaring the works of God in the Generation which he ca&s;t them into, will accept of my labour, however mean and incon&s;iderable. I &s;hall adde no more, but pray that the ble&s;&s;ing of heaven may be upon undertakings of this nature.</P>

<HEAD>A RELATION OF THE FIRST TROUBLES IN New-England By rea&s;on of the <HI>INDANS</HI> there</HEAD>
<P>IT is now above &s;eventy years, &s;ince that Part of this Continent which is known by the name of <HI>NEW-ENGLAND,</HI> was di&s;co|vered, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion thereof taken by the Engli&s;h. No man that hath made it his Concern to be acquainted with things of this na|ture can be ignorant, that the <HI>Northern,</HI> (or to us <HI>Northea&s;t</HI>) parts of this Land were the fir&s;t wherein were Engli&s;h Inhabitants; whence it was for &s;ome years known by the name of <HI>the Northern Planta|tion,</HI> until &s;uch time as King <HI>Charles</HI> the fir&s;t (then Prince of Wales) gave it the name of <HI>New England.</HI></P>
<P>For <HI>in Anno</HI> 1602. and in the year following, &s;ome of our Countrey|men made notable di&s;coveryes in that Land which lyeth North and by ea&s;t of <HI>Virginia,</HI> between the degrees of 43. &amp; 45. Northern Latitude.</P>
<P>Four or five years after this that noble Lord, Sr. <HI>John Popham</HI> (then Lord chief Ju&s;tice) &s;ent out a &s;hip into the&s;e parts to make further di&s;co|very, who arriving at the place de&s;igned, quickly returned, and made &s;uch a report of what they had &s;een, as did greatly animate the Adventurers to go on with their begun undertaking; whereupon in Anno 1607. A Gen|tleman
<PB N="2" REF="5"> who&s;e name was <HI>Popham</HI> was &s;ent into the&s;e Coa&s;ts, with two &s;hips and an hundred Land-men, and Ordnance, and other things nece&s;&s;ary for their &s;u&s;tentation and defence, in order to the making way for the &s;ettle|ment of a Plantation. But that noble Lord being taken out of the world by &s;udden death, al&s;o the Planters here meeting with &s;ad di&s;a&s;ters (for in the depth of winter, their lodgings and &s;tores were burn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">, and Capt. <HI>Pop|ham</HI> dyed among&s;t them) when the next year a ve&s;&s;el arrived bringing the news of the Lord <HI>Popham</HI>'s death, the whole company of the Engli&s;h re|&s;olved upon a return home, which proved the death of the Engli&s;h Plan|tation, at that time de&s;igned in the&s;e parts of the world. Only Sr. <HI>Fr. Popham</HI> (&s;on to the Lord chief Ju&s;tice) &s;ent diver&s;e times to tho&s;e coa&s;ts for trade and Fi&s;hing.</P>
<P>As yet there was not (&s;o far as I can learn) any di&s;turbance from the <HI>In|dians,</HI> then the only Natives of this Land. But not long after this, an un|worthy Ship-Ma&s;ter who&s;e name was <HI>Hunt,</HI> being &s;ent forth into the&s;e Coa&s;ts on the account of the Fi&s;hing trade, after he had made his di&s;patch and was ready to &s;ail, (under pretence of trucking with them) enticed In|dians into his ve&s;&s;el, they in confidence of his hone&s;ty went aboard, to the number of twenty from <HI>Patuxe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> &s;ince called <HI>Plimouth,</HI> and &s;even from <HI>No&s;&s;et</HI> (now known by the name of <HI>E&s;tam</HI>) the&s;e did this <HI>Hunt</HI> &s;eize upon, &s;towed them under hatches, and carried them to the &s;treights of <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">bral|tar,</HI> and there did he &s;ell as many as he could of them for 20<HI>l.</HI> a man, un|till it was known whence they came; for then the Friars in tho&s;e parts took away the re&s;t of them, that &s;o they might nurture them in the Popi&s;h Re|ligion. The pernicious and avaritious Felony of this Ship-Ma&s;ter, in &s;tealing and &s;elling the <HI>Indians</HI> to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> as hath been expre&s;&s;ed, laid the foundation to great <HI>troubles</HI> which did after that befall the En|gli&s;h, e&s;pecially in the <HI>North-ea&s;t</HI> parts of this Land. Yea that inhu|mane and barbarous Fact was the unhappy occa&s;ion of the lo&s;s of many a mans e&s;tate and life, which the Barbarians in tho&s;e beginning times did from thence &s;eek to de&s;troy.</P>
<P>For when the Gentlemen Adventurers did again di&s;patch a ve&s;&s;el hither commanded by Capt. <HI>Hob&s;on</HI> in order to erecting a Plantation and &s;etling a Trade with the Natives here, <HI>Hunt</HI>'s forementioned &s;candal, had cau&s;ed the Indians to contract &s;uch a mortal hatred again&s;t all men of the Engli&s;h Nation, that it was no &s;mall difficulty to &s;ettle any where within their Ter|ritoryes, And whereas there were two Indians called <HI>Epen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">w</HI> and <HI>Ma|nawet,</HI> who having been carried out of the&s;e parts of the world into <HI>Eng|land,</HI> had learned to &s;peak Engli&s;h, that were returned in <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">b&s;ons</HI> ve&s;&s;el, as hoping they might be &s;erviceable toward the de&s;ign on foot, it
<PB N="3" REF="5"> fell out otherwi&s;e; &s;ince being exa&s;perated by what <HI>Hunt</HI> had done, they contrived with their Country-men how to be revenged upon the Engli&s;h. <HI>Manawet</HI> dyed within a &s;hort time after the &s;hips arrival. <HI>Epenow</HI> &s;e|cretly plotted to free him&s;elf out of the Engli&s;h hands, which he effected though with great hazard to him&s;elf and other <HI>Salvages</HI> that were his fel|low <HI>Con&s;pirators,</HI> which came to pa&s;s after this manner.</P>
<P>Upon the Ships arrival, many of the Indians (&s;ome of them being <HI>Epe|nows</HI> kin&s;men) came aboard and were kindly entertained by the Captain; at their departure they promi&s;ed to return the next day, and bring &s;ome Trade with them. <HI>Epenow</HI> had not liberty granted him to go on &s;hoar, only much di&s;cour&s;e (and probably a contrivement for his e&s;cape) was be|tween him and the other Indians in the ve&s;&s;el, which no body but them|&s;elves could under&s;tand. The Indians returned at the time appointed with twenty <HI>Canons,</HI> but were &s;hy of coming aboard. <HI>Epenow</HI> cunningly called to them as if if he would have them come into the ve&s;&s;el, to trade, and &s;uddenly did him&s;elf leap overboard: He was no &s;ooner in the wa|ter, but the Indians &s;ent a &s;hower of arrows into the ve&s;&s;el, and came de&s;|perately near to the &s;hip, and (in de&s;pight of all the Engli&s;h Mu&s;ketiers aboard) went away with their Country-man <HI>Epenow.</HI></P>
<P>Diver&s;e of the Indians were then &s;lain by the Engli&s;h, and the Ma&s;ter of the Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;el, and &s;everal of the Company wounded by the Indians.</P>
<P>Hereupon the Captain and the whole company were di&s;couraged, and returned to England, bringing nothing back with them but the news of their bad &s;ucce&s;s, and that there was a <HI>War</HI> broke out between the <HI>En|gli&s;h,</HI> and the <HI>Indians.</HI> The time when the&s;e troubles hapned, is contro|verted more then the things them&s;elves. <HI>Johannes de Laet</HI> in his <HI>de&s;crip|tio Indiae Occidentalis,</HI> writeth that it was between the years 1608 &amp; 1615 So doth <HI>Purcha&s;e.</HI> Sr. <HI>Ferdinando Gorges</HI> relates that he &s;ent Capt. <HI>Hob|&s;on</HI> into the&s;e parts in Anno 1614, and what <HI>Hunt</HI> did was before that, as being the Grand procuring Cau&s;e of the Broyle between the Engli&s;h and the Indians, which fir&s;t began in that year.</P>
<P>After the&s;e things another ve&s;&s;el was &s;ent into the&s;e <HI>Northern</HI> parts un|der the Command of Capt. <HI>Rocr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ft,</HI> he de&s;igned to winter there, but &s;ome of his own &s;hips Company con&s;pired again&s;t him, intending his death, he having &s;ecret intelligence of this plot again&s;t his life, held his peace un|till the day was come wherein the intended mi&s;chief was to be put in exe|cution, then unexpectedly apprehended the Con&s;pirators; he was loth him&s;elf to put any to death, though they were worthy of it. But there|fore he re&s;olved to leave them in the Wilderne&s;s, not knowing but they might haply di&s;cover &s;omething which might be advantageous.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="6">
<P>Accordingly he furni&s;hed them with ammunition, and &s;ome victuals for their pre&s;ent &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and turned them a&s;hore to <HI>Sacodehock,</HI> him&s;elf with the re&s;t of his Company departing to <HI>Virginia.</HI> Tho&s;e Engli&s;h Mu|tineers got over to the I&s;land of <HI>Monhegin,</HI> three leagues from the Main, where they kept them&s;elves &s;afe from the Fury of exa&s;perated Indians, un|til the next Spring, when a ve&s;&s;el that came on the Coa&s;t on a Fi&s;hing voy|age, found them all (except one per&s;on that died of &s;ickne&s;s in this inter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">m) alive, and carried them away back for England.</P>
<P>Not many years after this, <HI>viz.</HI> in Anno. 1619 a Gentleman who&s;e name was <HI>Darmer</HI> was &s;ent to pro&s;ecute the de&s;ign of planting and &s;etling a Trade in <HI>New-England,</HI> and to endeavour that a right under&s;tanding of matters between the Indians and the Engli&s;h might be accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>He therefore brought with him an Indian called <HI>Squantum,</HI> who was one of tho&s;e that <HI>Hunt</HI> had treacherou&s;ly carried away from <HI>Patuxet,</HI> but was bought by an Engli&s;h Merchant, and lived &s;ome time with Mr. <HI>Slany</HI> a Gentleman in <HI>Cornhil,</HI> until he could &s;peak broken Engli&s;h, and after that at <HI>New-found-land,</HI> where Capt. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI> was then Governour, who was willing that Mr. <HI>Da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">mer</HI> &s;hould take <HI>Squantum</HI> with him to <HI>New-England.</HI> Upon his arrival here, he told his Countreymen very &s;trange &s;toryes, giving them to under&s;tand what kind u&s;age he had met with a|mong the Engli&s;h where he had been, and how much the wicked Fact of that covetous <HI>Hunt</HI> was condemned, &s;o that many of them began to con|ver&s;e with, and become friendly toward the Engli&s;h, and Mr <HI>Darmer</HI> conceited that he and <HI>Squantum</HI> had made a firm peace between the Na|tions. But, <HI>manet alta mente repo&s;tum</HI>&mdash; Indians are not wont to forget injuries, when once they have &s;u&s;tained any: &s;o did that Gentleman find it to his after &s;orrow: For being near the place where <HI>Hunt</HI> had for|merly betrayed the Indians aboard his ve&s;sel, they treacherously &s;et upon him, and gave him fourteen wounds, &s;o that he had much adoe to e&s;cape with his life, And though he got to <HI>Virginia</HI> after this, &s;ome write that he never recovered of tho&s;e wounds which he received of the <HI>Nau&s;it</HI> Indians. And <HI>Epenow</HI> (before mentioned) was the cau&s;e of Capt. <HI>Darmers</HI> being &s;o a&s;saulted, whom he hapned to meet with at his fir&s;t landing in that place: The Indian being able to &s;peak Engli&s;h, reported to Capt. <HI>Darmer</HI> the &s;tory of his e&s;cape out of Capt. <HI>Hob&s;ons</HI> ve&s;sel, laughing heartily at the conceit of it. The Captain told him that Sr. <HI>Ferdinando Gorges</HI> was much troubled that he &s;hould meet with &s;uch ill u&s;age as to put him upon a temptation to &s;teal away. This Salvage after &s;ome enquiries about Sr. <HI>Ferdinando</HI> (and his Family) with whom he had &s;ometimes lived in Eng|land, belike &s;u&s;pecting that Captain <HI>Darmer</HI> had a purpo&s;e to &s;urprize
<PB N="5" REF="6"> him, he con&s;pired with &s;ome of his Fellows to take the Captain, and laid hands on him, who did with his &s;word manfully defend him&s;elf again&s;t tho&s;e barbarous and treacherous A&s;sailants. What other particular mi&s;|chiefs were done by the <HI>Northern Indians</HI> (or others) about this time, I cannot learn: Only Capt. <HI>Smith</HI> writeth that he met with many of their <HI>&s;illy Encounters</HI> (as he cals them) but without any hurt. Al&s;o, a little before the fir&s;t planters in <HI>Plymouth</HI> Colony arrived in this land, three En|gli&s;hmen belonging to Sr. <HI>Ferdinando Gorges,</HI> were killed by the&s;e &s;alva|ges, and two more narrowly e&s;caped with their lives. And thus far wee have a <HI>Cold</HI> account of the de&s;ign re&s;pecting the advancement of a plan|tation in the <HI>Northern</HI> parts of <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Anno</HI> 1620. A company of Chri&s;tians belonging to the <HI>Northern parts of England,</HI> who propo&s;ed not &s;o much worldly as &s;piritual ends in their undertaking, ayming at the <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of the wor&s;hip of God in purity, did therefore tran&s;port them|&s;elves and familyes into this Howling wilderne&s;s. The fir&s;t land they made was that of <HI>Cape Cod,</HI> Novemb. 9. where they came to an Anchor, and went on &s;hore, Novemb. 11. Perceiving the Incommodiou&s;ne&s;s of that place for planting, they re&s;olved to &s;eek out for another that might be more accommodate. But their Shallop not being in trimm to be &s;ent out upon di&s;covery, &s;ome were de&s;irous to improve the time, in making what &s;earches they could upon the land thereabout.</P>
<P>Novemb. 5. Sixteen men well armed were &s;et on &s;hore under the conduct of Capt. <HI>Miles Standi&s;h.</HI> After they had gone about a mile near the &s;hoar, they de&s;cryed five or &s;ix Indians, who like wild creatures ran away from them at the fir&s;t &s;ight, they followed them by the trace of their footings, about ten miles, til night came on, but could not come to any &s;peech with them.</P>
<P>At la&s;t they met with a kettle, wherein was Indian corn, which after much con&s;ultation they &s;eized upon, re&s;olving that if they could come to &s;peak with Indians, they would return them their Kettel, and give them full &s;ati&s;faction for their corn, which they intended for planting, not knowing how el&s;e to be &s;upplyed. So did they return the next day, but lo&s;t them&s;elves awhile in the woods, and as they were wandring up &amp; down, they hapned to e&s;py a &s;mall tree that was bowed down, and &s;ome Acorns &s;trewed underneath, whil&s;t they were viewing of it, and wonder|ing what it &s;hould mean, it gave a &s;udden jerk, whereby one of the Com|pany was caught up by the leg, it being an Indian Deer-trap; the re&s;t loo&s;|ed him, and at la&s;t they found their way to the &s;hip again.</P>
<P>After this, their Shallop being fitted for the purpo&s;e, they went a coa&s;t|ing
<PB N="6" REF="7"> upon di&s;covery, but of &s;ome dayes could meet with no Indians. Al|beit they found old de&s;erted Indian Forts, and more of their corn and baskets, and a bottle of oyle which doubtle&s;s &s;ome how was brought out of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>About the tenth of December, they di&s;cerned the track of Indian feet upon the &s;and, and followed it, till they perceived where it &s;truck up in|to the woods, at la&s;t they light upon an Indian path, which led them a great way up into the woods, and &s;aw where there had been corn planted, and found Indian graves &amp;c. but no man appeared.</P>
<P>So they returned to their Shallop, and &s;ome watching, others betook them&s;elves to their re&s;t. But in the night they were alarmed by the Sen|tinels crying <HI>Arm, Arm,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing Indians to be near them. They heard a mo&s;t hideous howling, but one in the Company per&s;waded the re&s;t, that it was the noy&s;e of wolves and Foxes, which u&s;ed (as he &s;aid) to make &s;uch a noi&s;e in <HI>New-found-Land</HI> where he had been, two gunns were &s;hot off, at which the noi&s;e cea&s;ed.</P>
<P>But betimes in the morning, on a &s;udden they heard the &s;ame voices a|gain, and one of the company cryed <HI>Indians, Indians,</HI> and immediate|ly arrowes came pouring in upon them. This barbarous &s;alutation was amazing to the Engli&s;h, but that which did mo&s;t of all terrifie was the hor|rid cry of tho&s;e Salvages, who&s;e note was after this manner, <HI>Woach woach ha ha hoch woach.</HI> A &s;tout Indian who was thought to be their Captain, &s;tanding behind a tree let fly his arrows apace, and &s;tood three &s;hotts of a musket, untill one took full aim at him, and (as tis &s;uppo&s;ed) &s;orely wounded him, upon which he gave an extraordinary &s;hriek, and went a|way, and all the other Indians fled with him. Providence &s;o ordered, as that none of the Engli&s;h received any hurt, though afterwards they ga|thered up eighteen arrows, (and many more were &s;hot at them) &s;ome whereof were headed with bra&s;s, others with Harts-horn, others with Eagles Claws, and &s;undry of the Engli&s;h had their coats &s;hot through &amp; through.</P>
<P>Decemb. 19. The Engli&s;h landed and re&s;olved to endeavour the &s;etling of a plantation, at that place which is now called <HI>Plymouth.</HI> No Indians there as yet appeared to give them any di&s;turbance: Yea though &s;ome were &s;ent out to &s;eek after them, they could find none.</P>
<P>There were not many dayes after this, two Engli&s;hmen who being by the &s;ide of a pond, hapned to &s;ee a Deer, and having Dogs with them, they pur&s;ued the Deer until &s;uch time as they lo&s;t them&s;elves in the woods, where they were forced to lodge that night, and were terrified with the yelling (as it &s;eemed to them) of two <HI>Lions,</HI> who roared exceedingly, and
<PB N="7" REF="7"> a third that they thought was very neer them: they betook them&s;elves to a tree, purpo&s;ing if the Lions &s;hould come, to climb that for their &s;ecuri|ty; but they &s;aw none. The next day they perceived that Indians had made fires thereabouts, but it was wel they met not with any until they came home, being then unarmed and not fit for encounter with &s;uch Ene|mies.</P>
<P>Now it was that a &s;pecial providence of another nature hapned: For the Engli&s;h having built an hou&s;e in <HI>Plimouth,</HI> a &s;park of fire flying into the thatch, it was in&s;tantly burnt down. Mr. <HI>Carver</HI> and Mr. <HI>Bradford</HI> were then &s;ick, yet if they had not ri&s;en with good &s;peed, they had been blown up with powder. The hou&s;e was full of beds as they could lye one by another, and their muskets charged, yet (through the good pro|vidence of God) no hurt done.</P>
<P>Febr. 16. An Engli&s;h-man that was gone forth upon a fowling de&s;ign, e&s;pyed twelve Indians marching toward the Engli&s;h plantation, and heard the noi&s;e of many more not far off, he lay clo&s;e untill they were gone by, and then with all &s;peed returned home and gave the alarm, but no Indians followed, only they took away the tools of tho&s;e Engli&s;h, that had been at work in the woods.</P>
<P>The next day two Indians pre&s;ented them&s;elves on the top of an hill; two Engli&s;h went out to parly with them, but they ran away, and the noi&s;e of a multitude of them was heard on the other &s;ide of the hill.</P>
<P>In the beginning of <HI>March,</HI> an Indian called <HI>Samo&s;et</HI> came boldly a|long the hou&s;es, which were newly built in <HI>Plimouth,</HI> and to their great a|mazement, &s;pake to them in Engli&s;h, &s;aying, <HI>Welcome Engli&s;hmen;</HI> This In|dian was a <HI>Sagamore</HI> belonging to the <HI>Northern parts,</HI> about <HI>Monhiggen,</HI> where he had often conver&s;ed with Engli&s;h Fi&s;hermen, and had learned to &s;peak broken Engli&s;h; Hee was the fir&s;t Indian that they of Plymouth had opportunity to di&s;cour&s;e with, Hee could tel them of the <HI>Hugg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ry</HI> (as he called it) i. e. <HI>Fight,</HI> which the Engli&s;h had with the <HI>Nau&s;&s;et</HI> Indians; and that the name of that place was called <HI>Patuxet,</HI> where a multitude of In|dians had formerly lived, but they were all dead of the plague which had been there a few years before the Engli&s;h came. This <HI>Samo&s;et</HI> within a few dayes after his departure returned again, and brought <HI>Squantum</HI> (whom that wicked <HI>Hunt</HI> had &s;tolen away and &s;old for a &s;lave) along with him; which <HI>Squ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ntum</HI> was born in that place. <HI>Samo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">t</HI> and <HI>Squantum</HI> made it their bu&s;ine&s;s to bring the Engli&s;h into acquaintance with the next neigh|bouring Indians: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">herefore they undertook to bring <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;a&s;oit</HI> (father to that <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">p</HI> who began the <HI>War</HI> with the Engli&s;h <HI>Iun.</HI> 24. 1675.) to treat with the Engli&s;h at <HI>Plymouth.</HI></P>
<PB N="8" REF="8">
<P>Accordingly, March 22. <HI>Ma&s;&s;a&s;oit</HI> with his brother <HI>Quadequina</HI> came accompanied with about &s;ixty of his men; and an agreement of peace be|tween the Engli&s;h and Indians was then concluded on. This peace was in more re&s;pects then one &s;ingularly advantagious to the Engli&s;h, whil&s;t they were thus but few in number, and &s;trangers in this land.</P>
<P>And as for the rea&s;ons inducing <HI>Ma&s;&s;a&s;oit</HI> to this accord with the En|gli&s;h, there were &s;everal things that prevailed with him thereunto; For <HI>Squantum</HI> had told him what a great Prince King <HI>James</HI> was, and how well he would take it if his Subjects were kindly entertained, and how ill if otherwi&s;e, and how ea&s;y it was for him to &s;end over &s;hips and men e|nough to de&s;troy <HI>Ma&s;&s;a&s;oit</HI> and all his people. At that time al&s;o there was enmity between <HI>Ma&s;&s;a&s;oit,</HI> and the <HI>Narragan&s;ets,</HI> &s;o that he hoped the Engli&s;h might be a defence to him again&s;t them. Thus did the feud which was kindled among&s;t the Indians one again&s;t another, advantage the poor Church in Plymouth. <HI>Sic Canes lingunt ulcera Lazari.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover the con&s;ideration of the Guns, and other warlike Weapons, which ours brought with them, vvas terrible to the Indians, yea they had more formidable apprehen&s;ions thereof, then there vvas real cau&s;e for: They imagined that the Engli&s;h could by their great Guns cau&s;e the trees to fall dovvn and kill the Indians. Furthermore <HI>Squantum</HI> did wickedly po&s;&s;e&s;s them with one delu&s;ion about the Engli&s;h, which had di&s;mal Im|pre&s;&s;ions upon the minds of the&s;e ignorant Barbarians; For whereas the plague (a di&s;ea&s;e which was never known in this land either before or &s;ince) had newly been raging among&s;t them, whereby many of their towns were totally depopulated, and de&s;olated: he made them beleive that the Engli&s;h kept the plague in a place under ground, and that they could let it loo&s;e upon the Indians when they would. An Indian called <HI>Hob|bomock</HI> being one of <HI>Ma&s;&s;a&s;oits</HI> Coun&s;ellors, ob&s;erving in one of the Eng|li&s;h hou&s;es a kind of a Cellar, where &s;ome barrels of powder were be|&s;towed, enquired of <HI>Squantum</HI> what that was, To whom he replyed, that there the Engli&s;h kept the plague that he told them of, which they could let loo&s;e upon Indians at plea&s;ure. When this <HI>Hobbomock</HI> became acquainted with the Engli&s;h, he &s;eriou&s;ly asked them whether they had any &s;uch power, they an&s;wered him truly that they had not, but withall added that the God whom they &s;erved had power to &s;end that or any o|ther di&s;ea&s;e upon tho&s;e that &s;hould doe any wrong to his people. The Con&s;ideration of that al&s;o, was &s;ome terror to the Indians.</P>
<P>In the Moneth of <HI>June</HI> 1621. The Engli&s;h &s;ent Me&s;&s;engers with a Pre|&s;ent to <HI>Ma&s;&s;a&s;oit</HI> at <HI>Pocanoket,</HI> By the way they were acco&s;ted with &s;eve|ral of the Indians, who having them at an Advantage as they pa&s;&s;ed
<PB N="9" REF="8"> through a River, were ready to &s;hoot at them. Only having Indian Guides and Interpreters in their Company, who gave them to under|&s;tand that they were friends, no hurt was done.

<P>The&s;e things hapned in <HI>May,</HI> 1622. in which year it was that Mr. <HI>We&s;ton</HI> (a merchant of good note in <HI>London</HI>) attempted the advancing a plantation in this <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Bay.</HI> He &s;ent over two &s;hips, and a|bout &s;ixty men to make a beginning.

<P>Mr. <HI>Wir&s;l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">w</HI> (who was afterwards Governour of Plymouth Colony) reports that the <HI>We&s;tonians</HI> in&s;tead of proving an help to the other En|gli&s;h Colony, had like within a few moneths to have brought ruine not only upon them&s;elves, but upon their friends al&s;o: For complaints were quickly brought to Plymouth, that the Engli&s;h at <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;egusqua&s;et,</HI> d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d abu&s;e the Indians by &s;tealing their corn from them, yea and one of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">m was &s;o bruiti&s;h as to turn Indian.</P>
<P>Others of them were of &s;uch &s;ervile and &s;lavi&s;h di&s;po&s;itions, as that they became &s;ervants to the Indians, who would hire them to work with them in making Canoos, which Canoos were intended for the &s;ur|prizal of the Engli&s;h &s;hip, in the day when they would execute their de|&s;igned Ma&s;&s;acre.</P>
<P>Some of the Theeves were &s;tockt and whipt, yea one of them was at la&s;t put to death, to &s;ati&s;fie the Indians; but it was then too late.</P>
<P>By the end of <HI>February,</HI> they had &s;pent all their bread and corn, not leaving any for &s;eed, nor would the Indians be induced to lend or &s;el them any, upon any terms, hoping they would be &s;tarved to death.</P>
<P>Wherefore, they purpo&s;ed to take away the Indians &s;tore from them by violence, and therefore made preparations accordingly. Only &s;ome of the Company (at lea&s;twi&s;e one of them who is yet alive) being more hone&s;tly minded then others were, advi&s;ed <HI>John Saunders</HI> their Over|&s;eer, to write to <HI>Plymouth</HI> before they did actually attempt any thing, which being done, they received letters from the Governour there, &s;ig|nifying great di&s;approbation of their intended proceedings, whereupon they de&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>The&s;e motions mu&s;t needs cau&s;e ill blood between the Nations: &s;o that the Indians grew very in&s;olent in their carriage, and there were &s;e|cret con&s;piracyes to cut off the Engli&s;h.

<P>The Engli&s;h of Plymouth as yet being Ignorant of the bloody mi&s;|chief, which the Treacherous hearts of the Indians had concluded a|gain&s;t them, attended thei occa&s;ions as formerly.</P>
<P>Upon a time Capt. <HI>Standi&s;h</HI> going with &s;ome men in a Shallop, to buy Corn of the Indians at <HI>No&s;&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> one of them &s;tole certain trifles out of the Shallop; whereupon the Captain repaired to the <HI>Sachim,</HI> and told him, that if he did not immediately re&s;tore tho&s;e things, he would re|venge it before his departure, and &s;o took leave for that night.</P>
<P>The next morning, the <HI>Sachim</HI> came accompanied with his train of &s;alvages, &s;aluting the Captain in &s;uch a manner as was hugely ridicu|lous to the Engli&s;h; For he put out his tongue, that one might &s;ee the root of it, and &s;o licked the Captains hands, al his men doing the like, and endeavouring (according to the rude information they had recei|ved from <HI>Squantum</HI>) to make him a leg, he did perform his Ceremony after &s;uch an odd manner, as the Engli&s;h were hard put to it to refrain from open laughter.</P>
<Q>Spectatum admi&s;&s;i ri&s;um teneatis Amici?</Q>
<P>After the&s;e Complements were over, he re&s;tored the things that were le&s;t; withal declaring, that he had <HI>much beaten</HI> the Indian that did <HI>Commooten</HI> (i. e. &s;teal) the trifles mentioned.</P>
<P>But not long after this, the Captain was in no &s;mal hazard of his life in another place; For going to <HI>Manomet</HI> (now called <HI>Sandwich</HI>) and being there entertained in the hou&s;e of <HI>Kunacum,</HI> the <HI>Sachim</HI> there the Indians de&s;igned to cut off him and his men.</P>
<P>There was with him at this time, a <HI>Cap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">-Indian</HI> called <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">omet,</HI> who pretended friend&s;hip to the Engli&s;h, but was &s;ecretly joined in the bloody Confederacy. That he might not be &s;u&s;pected, he profe&s;&s;ed &s;pe|cial affection towards the Captain, and would, as a gift, be&s;tow &s;ome Corn upon him, and help him to carry the Corn to his boat, and would lodge in the <HI>Wigwam</HI> with Capt. <HI>Standi&s;k,</HI> to manife&s;t what love and honour he did bear towards him, having in the mean time promi&s;ed the Indians to kil him that night, and when he was killed the re&s;t were to di&s;patch his men.</P>
<P>Al&s;o whil&s;t he was entertained in the Sachims hou&s;e, there came in two Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et Indians, being de&s;perate bloody villains. The name of the Chief of them was <HI>Wittawamet,</HI> who took a dagger from about his neck, and pre&s;ented it to the <HI>Sachim,</HI> and made a &s;peech to him (which the Captain could not under&s;tand) boa&s;ting of his own valour,
<PB N="14" REF="11"> and how he had been the death of Chri&s;tians both French and Engli&s;h and what pittifull weak Creatures they were, that when they were kil|ling, they died crying, and made &s;ower faces, more like children then men, and that whereas they were determined to kil the Engli&s;h (who had injured them) of Mr. <HI>We&s;tons</HI> plantation, the be&s;t way for their own &s;ecurity was, to kill them of <HI>P ymouth</HI> too, now their Captain being in their hands, having but &s;ix men with him, two or three in the <HI>Wigwam,</HI> and no more in the &s;hallop, it was a good opportunity to begin.</P>
<P>The murderous Coun&s;el of this Audacious Bloud-&s;ucker, was highly applauded; and the Indians waited when Capt. <HI>Standi&s;h</HI> would fall a|&s;leep, that they might attempt the bloudy Tragedy. But God &s;o or|dered that he could not &s;leep that night. Al&s;o, an Indian &s;ecretly &s;tole &s;ome Beads from him; which when the Captain perceived, he immedi|ately called his &s;ix men together, and they be&s;et the Sachims hou&s;e, pro|fe&s;&s;ing to him that as they would not doe wrong to him, &s;o neither would they receive any, and therefore as they valued their lives, they &s;hould forthwith re&s;tore the &s;tolen goods. Hereupon the <HI>Sach<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> be|&s;tirred him&s;elf to find out the Thief, and having done &s;o, he cometh to the Captain de&s;iring him to look into his boat, if the beads that he mi&s;&s;ed were not there, who looking found them lying openly on the Cuddy, the Indians having &s;lily conveyed them thither. However this did &s;o daunt the courage of the treacherous and cowardly Indians, that they attempted not their de&s;igned mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>All this while, they of Plimouth Colony had no certain knowledg of the evil that was intended again&s;t them, by the Heathen albeit the Con|&s;piracy was very &s;trong, for the Indians at <HI>No&s;&s;et, Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">met, Sacon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">, Manomet, Mattachie&s;t, A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> were all in this Confederacy to cut off the Engli&s;h.

<P>The fir&s;t day whil&s;t on their journey back again, they were accom|panyed with <HI>Coubatant</HI> the Sachim of <HI>Metapoy&s;et</HI> (before mentioned) who was a politick and joco&s;e Indian, and &s;til &s;u&s;pected to be fal&s;e to the Engli&s;h; He asked Mr. <HI>Win&s;low,</HI> how they, being but two, dared to tru&s;t them&s;elves among&s;t &s;o many Indians.

At the &s;ame time his men fell upon <HI>Wittawamat,</HI> and the o|ther Indian, and &s;lew them, and took <HI>Wittawamats</HI> brother, and han|ged him.</P>
<P>After this they &s;et upon another company of Indians, and killed two or three of them, &s;eeking &s;til after more.

<P>At the time of the&s;e skirmi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">hes, there was an Indian youth, who not|with&s;tanding the &s;laughter made among&s;t his countreymen, came run|ning to the Engli&s;h, de&s;iring that he might be with them.

<P>Al&s;o an Indian Spye, who was taken pri&s;oner and detained at <HI>Pli|mouth,</HI> when he &s;aw Cap. <HI>Standi&s;h</HI> return with <HI>Wittawamats</HI> Head, look|ed on it with a guilty, ga&s;tred countenance, and then confe&s;&s;ed the Plot that was in hand to de&s;troy the Engli&s;h, and that <HI>Picksuot</HI> and

<P>Furthermore, the effect of the&s;e things was, that the re&s;t of the Indians were &s;tricken with &s;uch terror, and dread of the Engli&s;h, that they left their hou&s;es, and betook them&s;elves to live in unhealthfull <HI>Swamps,</HI> wherby they became &s;ubject to mi&s;erable di&s;ea&s;es, that proved mortal to multitudes of them.

<P>The Sachim roundly rejoyned, that either &s;ome or all of them had been abu&s;ive to him; for they had &s;tolen away his corn, and though he had given them notice of it times without number, yet there was no &s;atisfaction nor reformation attained.</P>
<P>Hereupon, the Engli&s;h took the principal <HI>Thief</HI> and bound him and delivered him to the <HI>Sachim,</HI> with all declaring, that he might do with him what he plea&s;ed. Nay (&s;aid he) Sachims do ju&s;tice them&s;elves upon their own men, and let their neighbours do ju&s;tice upon theirs, otherwi&s;e we conclude that they are all agreed, and then fight.</P>
<P>Now the Indians &s;ome of them began to tremble, and beholding the Guns which were mounted on the Engli&s;h Fort, they &s;aid one to ano|ther (in their Language) that little guns would &s;hoot through hou&s;es, and great guns would break down trees, and make them fall and kill Indians round about. So did they depart at that time di&s;&s;atisfied and enraged.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h now perceiving that the Indians were fully purpo&s;ed to be revenged on them, they re&s;olved to fight it out to the la&s;t man.</P>
<P>As they were marching out of the Fort, &s;even or eight men &s;tood &s;til. &s;aying, this is the &s;econd time that the Salvages had demanded the life of him that had wronged them, and therefore they would have him fir&s;t put to death, and if that would not &s;atisfy, then to fight it out to the la&s;t, wherefore he was put to death in the &s;ight of the Heathen; after which the Engli&s;h marched out towards them, but they di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves into the woods.</P>
<P>This <HI>Relator</HI> endeavoured to give notice to them in <HI>Plymouth,</HI> how that the Indians had contrived their ruin, but he mi&s;&s;ed his way between <HI>Weymouth</HI> and <HI>Plymouth;</HI> and it was wel he did &s;o; for by that means, he e&s;caped the &s;avage hands of tho&s;e Indians, who immediately pur&s;ued him, with a murderous intention Ere he could reach <HI>Plymouth,</HI> they were informed by <HI>Ma&s;&s;a&s;oit</HI> (as hath been declared) concerning what was plotted among&s;t the Indians.</P>
<P>Finally there were (as this <HI>Relator</HI> te&s;tifieth) three &s;everal skirmi&s;hes with the Indians. One at <HI>We&s;egu&s;qua&s;et,</HI> before mentioned; another at a place where the town of <HI>Dorche&s;ter</HI> is &s;ince planted; and la&s;tly at the Bay of <HI>Agawam</HI> or <HI>Ip&s;wich;</HI> in all which engagements, the Indians
<PB N="20" REF="14"> were notably beaten, and the Engli&s;h received no con&s;iderable damage, &s;o that the Sachims entreated for peace, nor were the Engli&s;h, (provi|ded it might be upon terms &s;afe and honourable) aver&s;e thereunto, <HI>Pacem te po&s;cimus omnes.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e dark clouds being thus comfortably di&s;pelled, and blown o|ver, the <HI>fir&s;t Planters</HI> in this Country received no con&s;iderable di&s;tur|bance from the Indians a long time. It is true, that &s;oon upon the&s;e motions, (viz. in Augu&s;t, Anno 1623.) a Gentleman arrived here out of <HI>England</HI> (namely Capt. <HI>Robert Gorges</HI>) being attended, with ma|ny &s;ervants, as purpo&s;ing the &s;ettlement of an Engli&s;h plantation in this Bay of <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets;</HI> and although that plantation was quickly de&s;er|ted and di&s;&s;olved, other things, and not any anoyance from the Natives here cau&s;ed tho&s;e de&s;igns to prove abortive.</P>
<P>The like is to be affirmed concerning Mr. <HI>Wolla&s;tons</HI> plantation. For whereas he with &s;everal others, being per&s;ons of quality, did (in the year 1625) with a multitude of &s;ervants come into this <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;ets Bay,</HI> as intending to &s;ettle a plantation therein, they met with &s;uch cro&s;s providences as did di&s;courage them, and at la&s;t di&s;&s;ipate them, yet nothing from the Indians.</P>
<P>I have been informed, that this Gentleman con&s;idering the unhappy <HI>Cata&s;trophe's</HI> attending Mr. <HI>We&s;ton</HI> and Mr. <HI>Gorges,</HI> their plantings at <HI>We&s;egu&s;qua&s;et,</HI> conceited that the Indian <HI>Powaws</HI> had brought that place under &s;ome fa&s;cination, and that Engli&s;hmen would never thrive upon <HI>Enchanted ground,</HI> and therefore they would pitch down their &s;takes in a place nearer to <HI>Bo&s;ton;</HI> even where the town of <HI>Brantree</HI> hath &s;ince flouri&s;hed; but the difficultyes of a Wilderne&s;s were too hard for them, that Mr. <HI>Wolla&s;ton</HI> removed a great part of his &s;ervants to <HI>Virgi|nia,</HI> not having (&s;o far as I can under&s;tand) received any mole&s;tation from the Indians here.</P>
<P>In Anno 1628. Mr. <HI>Endecot</HI> (who de&s;erves to be honourably menti|oned, as having been a <HI>Patriot</HI> in <HI>New-England</HI>) arrived here with a <HI>Patent</HI> for the Government of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets.</HI> He and others with him &s;at down at a place called <HI>Nahumkeik</HI> (as in a Parenthe&s;is let me here ob&s;erve, that that Indian word is al&s;o Hebrew, <GAP LANG="heb" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF"> <HI>Nahum</HI> &s;ignifieth <HI>Con&s;olation,</HI> &amp; <GAP LANG="heb" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF"> <HI>keik</HI> is hebrew for a <HI>Boo&s;ome,</HI> or haven, and it &s;o fals out, that the Engli&s;h have hapned to call that place by another name which is al&s;o Hebrew, viz. <HI>Salem</HI>) There did they enjoy <HI>Peace.</HI> How|beit there are Antient Planters, who te&s;tifie that the Indians being po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed with &s;ome fears le&s;t the Engli&s;h &s;hould in time take their Coun|trey
<PB N="21" REF="14"> from them, were con&s;piring to de&s;troy them. And the &s;mall handfull of Chri&s;tians then in <HI>Salem,</HI> were alarmd with the report of no le&s;s then a thou&s;and Barbarous Natives, coming to cut them off, and that upon a Lords day, whereupon they di&s;charged &s;everal great guns, the &s;mall &s;hot wherein made &s;uch a terrible ratling among&s;t the trees a|far off, that the amazed Indians returned not a little affrighted. And it was a wonderfull providence of God, now to re&s;train the Heathen, &s;ince it &s;o hapned that about this time there were &s;ome Tumults a|bout the Engli&s;h them&s;elves. For whereas Mr. <HI>Wolla&s;ton</HI> and his Part|ners left &s;ome of their &s;ervants here, and gave order that a man who&s;e name was <HI>Filcher,</HI> &s;hould command and over&s;ee them. There was an|other who&s;e name was <HI>Thomas Morton,</HI> he would needs take upon him to be <HI>Lord of Mi&s;-rule,</HI> and having gained much by trading with the <HI>Indians,</HI> this <HI>Morton</HI> and his drunken Companions quickly wa&s;ted all in riotous living.</P>
<P>This was the man that taught the Indians in the&s;e parts <HI>the u&s;e of Guns,</HI> how they &s;hould charge and di&s;charge them, and imployed them in Hunting for him: And when they were in&s;tructed in the u&s;e of the&s;e in&s;truments of death, they would purcha&s;e them at any rates, whereby the &s;afety of the Engli&s;h was not a little hazzarded.</P>
<P>In conclu&s;ion, the Engli&s;h at <HI>Plymouth</HI> and <HI>Salem,</HI> agreed to &s;eyze upon this <HI>Morton,</HI> which was done <HI>Vi &amp; armis,</HI> and he was &s;ent over to <HI>England,</HI> there to receive &s;uch puni&s;hment as by the honourable Council for <HI>New-England</HI> &s;hould be thought meet.</P>
<P>All the&s;e tumults notwith&s;tanding, the over-ruling providence of God kept the Indians quiet.</P>
<P>It is to be wondred at, that the Church in <HI>Plymouth</HI> &s;hould be pre|&s;erved when other Engli&s;h Plantations could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t in this Coun|trey, but either the Indians, or the Lords own hand brought them to a &s;udden end from time to time. But God who &s;aw that they de&s;igned &s;omething better then the world, in their planting here, brought it to pa&s;s by &s;uch wayes as the&s;e,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Ma&s;&s;a&s;oit</HI> (as was hinted before) was per&s;waded by <HI>Squantums</HI> information, that if the Engli&s;h &s;hould be his friends, he need not fear any enemies in the World; &s;o did he become a wall to the Engli&s;h at Plymouth again&s;t other Indians. The Earth helped the woman that was fled into the Wilderne&s;s, whom the Dragon would have &s;wallow|ed up.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Lord made them very &s;ucce&s;full in their expeditions again&s;t tho&s;e enemies that fir&s;t &s;ought their de&s;truction.</P>
<PB N="22" REF="15">
<P N="3">3. They prevailed with God by Fa&s;ting and Prayer to look upon them and ble&s;s them with &s;pecial mercy when it was a time of need, which did greatly affect and a&s;toni&s;h the Indians: &s;ome of them there|fore conceiving high thoughts concerning the Engli&s;h mans God, and his love to his people, that truly fear and &s;erve him. That which Mr <HI>Win&s;low</HI> (and &s;ince him another) doth publickly te&s;tifie concerning this matter, de&s;erveth Commemoration, namely, that whereas after the <HI>Fir&s;t Indian Troubles</HI> were over, there was a &s;ore drought on the land continuing for the &s;pace of &s;ix Weeks, in&s;omuch that it was judged by &s;ome that the corn was withered and dead, pa&s;t recovery, the <HI>Church in Plymouth</HI> &s;et them&s;elves by Fa&s;ting and Prayer, to &s;eek mer|cy from the Lord in this thing. And although in the morning when they a&s;&s;embled them&s;elves, the heavens were clear, and the drought as likely to continue as ever, yet before their &s;olemn Exerci&s;e was ended, the heavens grew black with clouds, and the next morning the&s;e clouds di&s;tilled rain, and for the &s;pace of fourteen dayes together there were moderate &s;howers, &s;o that the drooping corn was revived to admi+ration.</P>
<P>A friendly Indian, before mentioned, known by the name of <HI>Hobbo|mock,</HI> living in the town of Plymouth, enquired why the Engli&s;h met together in that manner, it being but three dayes after the Sabbath; and being informed of the true cau&s;e thereof, and ob&s;erving the graci|ous effects that followed, he was greatly affected, and told other Indi|ans of it, who were al&s;o &s;mitten with deep conviction, and the more in that, albeit in times of Drought the Indians are wont to <HI>Powaw</HI> and cry to their gods, &s;ometimes for many dayes together, yet if rain follow, it is wont to be accompanied with terrible Thundring and Lightning and tempe&s;ts, which often do more hurt then the rain doth good: whenas it was otherwi&s;e with re&s;pect to the &s;howers which at this time came from Heaven, in an&s;wer to the Prayers of the Church in Plymouth, So that the Heathen confe&s;&s;ed that the Engli&s;h mans God was better then theirs. And &s;ome among&s;t the Indians became faithfull to the Engli&s;h, though as yet but a very few,</P>
<Q>Apparent rari Nantes in Gurgite va&s;to.</Q>
<P>There having been (as was &s;aid) a <HI>Patent</HI> for the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets</HI> Go|vernment by royal Grant obtained, many out of England flocked into this Country almo&s;t every year. And for the mo&s;t part, not &s;o much on the account of Trade, or to pro&s;ecute any worldly intere&s;t, as on the account of Religion. The&s;e did God own, having wonderfully made way for their planting here by ca&s;ting out the Heathen before them,
<PB N="23" REF="15"> with mortal Di&s;ea&s;es, e&s;pecially by the <HI>Plague</HI> among&s;t the <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>Plimouth</HI> Colony, and the <HI>Small Pox</HI> among the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets.</HI></P>
<P>In Anno, 1631. New jealou&s;ies aro&s;e concerning the treacherous Indians. Capt. <HI>Walker</HI> one evening had two arrows &s;hot through his Coat, which cau&s;ed an Alarm at <HI>Lyn,</HI> then known by the name of <HI>Saw|gu&s;t:</HI> but no lives were lo&s;t, nor is there any certainty to this day who &s;hot tho&s;e arrows, whereby the Captains life was &s;o eminently endan|gered.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame time the Indians began to be quarrel&s;ome touching the bounds of the Land which they had &s;old to the Engli&s;h; but God ended the controver&s;y by &s;ending the &s;mall pox among&s;t the Indians at <HI>Saugu&s;t,</HI> who were before that time exceeding numerous; whole towns of them were &s;wept away, in &s;ome of them not &s;o much as one Soul e&s;|caping the de&s;truction. There are &s;ome old Planters &s;urviving to this day, who helped to bury the dead Indians, even whole familyes of them all dead at once. In one of the <HI>Wigwams</HI> they found a poor infant &s;ucking at the brea&s;t of the dead mother, all the other Indians being dead al&s;o.</P>
<P>Not long after this, when the town of <HI>Ip&s;wich</HI> was fir&s;t planted, it was vehemently &s;u&s;pected that the Tarratines (or ea&s;tern Indians) had a de&s;ign to cut off the Engli&s;h there. For a friendly Indian called <HI>Robin</HI> came to an Engli&s;hman who&s;e name is <HI>Perkins,</HI> acquainting him that &s;uch a Thur&s;day there would come four Indians to draw him to the water &s;ide under pretence of trucking with him, and that they had pre|pared forty <HI>Canooes</HI> which &s;hould ly out of &s;ight under the brow of an hill, full of armed Indians to cut off the Engli&s;h. The four Indians came at the time, and to the per&s;on mentioned, He in&s;tead of going to the water &s;ide to truck with them, &s;poke roughly to them, and cau&s;ed an Alarm, &s;o they immediately returned, perceiving their Plot was di&s;covered, and pre&s;ently fourty &s;uch Canooes as the friendly Indian had given warning of, were di&s;covered.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the Particulars which have been in&s;i&s;ted on, I cannot under|&s;tand that there was any general di&s;quietment rai&s;ed by the Indians, un|til the year 1636. It is true that &s;ome particular mi&s;chiefs and private Murthers were committed before that, after the forementioned trou|bles were a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">layed.

<P>And two yeares after that, Mr. <HI>John Oldham</HI> was ma&s;&s;acred by the Indians of <HI>Muni&s;&s;es,</HI> now called <HI>Block-I&s;land;</HI> which things made way for the <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">quot War,</HI> whereby the whole Engli&s;h Intere&s;t (yea the Intere&s;t of Chri&s;t, who had ere that taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this land, and gloriou&s;ly began to erect his own kingdome here) was threatned and endangered.</P>

<HEAD>Some Grounds of the War again&s;t the Pequots.</HEAD>
<P>In or about the year 1633. One Capt. <HI>Stone</HI> arrived in the <HI>Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;ets,</HI> in a &s;hip from <HI>Virginia,</HI> who &s;ometime after was bound for <HI>Virginia</HI> again, in a &s;mal Bark, with one Capt. <HI>Norton,</HI> who &s;ailing up Connecticut River, about two leagues from the entrance, ca&s;t An|chor; there coming to them &s;everal Indians belonging to that place, whom the <HI>Pequotts</HI> tyranized over, being a potent and a warlike peo|ple they being accu&s;tomed &s;o to deal with their neighbouring Indians. Capt. <HI>Stone</HI> having &s;ome occa&s;ion with the Dutch, who lived at a Tra|ding hou&s;e, near twenty leagues up the River, procured &s;ome of tho&s;e Indians to go as Pilots with two of his men to the Dutch; but they be|ing
<PB N="25" REF="16"> benighted, before they could come to their de&s;ired port, put the Skiffe, in which they went, a&s;hore; where the two Engli&s;hmen falling a&s;leep, were both murdered by their Indian guides, there remaining with the Bark, about twelve of the afore&s;aid Indians, who had in all probability, formerly plotted their bloody de&s;igne, and waiting an opportunity when &s;ome of the Engli&s;h were on &s;hore, and Capt. <HI>Stone</HI> a&s;leep in his Cabbin, &s;et upon them and cruelly murthered every one of them, and plundered what they plea&s;ed, and afterward &s;unk the Bark.</P>
<P>The&s;e Indians were not native <HI>Pequots,</HI> but had frequent recour&s;e to them, to whom they tendered &s;ome of tho&s;e goods, which were ac|cepted by the chief Sachem of the <HI>Pequots:</HI> and &s;ome of the Goods were tendered to the Sachim of <HI>Niantick</HI> who al&s;o received them.</P>
<P>The Honoured Council of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets</HI> hearing of the&s;e pro|ceedings of the <HI>Pequots,</HI> &s;ent to &s;peak with them, &amp; had &s;ome Treatyes, but no i&s;&s;ue was made to &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>After which, Capt. <HI>John Endicot</HI> was &s;ent forth Commander in chief, with Capt. <HI>&V;nderhill,</HI> Capt. <HI>Turner</HI> and about an hundred and twen|ty men, who were fir&s;tly de&s;igned again&s;t a people living on <HI>Block-I&s;land,</HI> who were &s;ubjects to the <HI>Narragan&s;et Sachem,</HI> they having taken a Barke of Mr. <HI>John Oldam,</HI> murthering him and his Compa|ny.

<P>After which the <HI>Pequots</HI> grew enraged again&s;t the Engli&s;h who in|habited <HI>Connecticut,</HI> being but a &s;mall number, about two hundred &amp; fifty who were there newly arrived, as al&s;o about twenty men at <HI>Sey-Brook</HI> under the command of Leiut. <HI>Lion.

<P>The <HI>Pequots</HI> ob&s;erving Lieut.

<P>They al&s;o lay &s;culking about the Fort almo&s;t con&s;tantly, that the Engli&s;h could not go out of the Fort, but they were a&s;&s;aulted by the <HI>pequods,</HI> &s;o that <HI>Connecticut</HI> out of their &s;mall numbers, con&s;trained

<P>In the interim, many of the <HI>Pequods</HI> went to a place now called <HI>We|thersfield</HI> on <HI>Connecticut,</HI> and having confederated with the Indians of that place (as it was generally thought) they lay in ambu&s;h for the Engli&s;h people of that place, and diver&s;e of them going to their la|bour in a large field adjoyning to the town, were &s;et upon by the In|dians, nine of the Engli&s;h were &s;lain upon the place, and &s;ome hor&s;es, and two young women were taken Captive.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pequoas</HI> at their return from Wethersfield, came down to the River of Connecticut, (Capt. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI> then being at <HI>Saybrook</HI> Fort) in three or more Canooes, with about an hundred men, the Engli&s;h e&s;|pying of them, concluded they had been acting &s;ome mi&s;chief again&s;t us, and therefore prepared one of their great Gunns, and made a &s;hot at them, which &s;hot &s;trook off the head of one of their Canooes wherein the two Captives were, al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">hough the &s;hot was made at them at a great di&s;tance, near three miles: but &s;eing it was &s;o placed, they ha&s;tned to the &s;hore, and drew their Canooes with what &s;peed they could over a narrow Beach and &s;o got away.</P>

<P>IN the beginning of May, 1637. there were &s;ent out by Connecticut Colony ninety men, under the command of Capt. <HI>John Ma&s;on</HI> (after|wards Major <HI>Ma&s;on,</HI> and Deputy Governour of Connecticut Colony) again&s;t the <HI>Pequots,</HI> with whom went <HI>&V;ncas</HI> an Indian Sachem of <HI>Mo|heag</HI> who was newly revolted from the <HI>Pequots.</HI></P>
<P>This &s;mall <HI>Army</HI> was &s;hipped in one Pink, one Pinnace &amp; one Shal|lop, &s;ome of which ve&s;&s;els in their pa&s;&s;age down Connecticut River, fell on ground, by rea&s;on of the lowne&s;s of the water, and the unskil|fulne&s;s of the Engli&s;h in the channel. The Indians not being wont|ed to &s;uch things with their &s;mall Canooes, and al&s;o being impatient of all delayes, de&s;ired they might be &s;et on &s;hore, promi&s;ing they would meet our Army at <HI>Seybrook;</HI> which reque&s;t of theirs was grant|ed: and they being &s;et at liberty ha&s;tning to their Quarters at <HI>Say|brook,</HI> met with about thirty or fourty of the <HI>Pequots</HI> near <HI>Seybrook,</HI> and ingaged them, and &s;lew &s;even of them upon the place, and had only one of their own wounded, who was conveyed back to <HI>Connecti|cut</HI> in a Skiffe.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>&V;nderhill</HI> hearing of the approach of the Army, went &amp; met them and informed them what was performed by <HI>&V;ncus</HI> and his men, which news was welcome to them, and looked upon as a &s;pecial pro|vidence; for before they were &s;omewhat doubtfull of the fidelity of their Indian Volunteers.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>&V;nderhill</HI> hearing of the de&s;ign our Army was upon, very freely offered his Service with nineteen men to go along with them, if Leiut. <HI>Gardner</HI> would allow of it (who was chief Commander at Seybrook Fort) which motion was no &s;ooner propounded to Lieut. <HI>Gardner,</HI> but he readily approved of it, and our Councill of War ac|cepted of it al&s;o; who in liew of tho&s;e twenty, immediately &s;ent back
<PB N="28" REF="18"> twenty of theirs to Connecticut to help guard the women and chil|dren &amp;c.</P>
<P>Upon a wednesday our Army arrived at Seybrook, where they lay wind-bound till Friday, in which time the Councill of War con&s;ulted how and in what manner they &s;hould proceed in their Enterprize, which was accompanied with much difficulty; their Commi&s;&s;ion order|ing them to land their men in the <HI>Pequit</HI> River, again&s;t which were the&s;e difficultyes.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. The <HI>Pequods</HI> kept a continual Guard upon the River, night and day in a con&s;tant cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Secondly. Their numbers far exceeded ours; they had al&s;o &s;ixteen gunns with powder and &s;hot, be&s;ides their Indian Artilery, as our Councill of War was informed by the two captive maids (mentioned where we declared the Grounds of this War) who were redeemed by the Dutch, and re&s;tored now to us at Seybrook, which was a very friendly office, and not to be forgotten.</P>
<P>Thirdly. They were on Land, and being &s;wift of foot, might much impede the landing of our men, and di&s;hearten them, they continu|ally guarding that River, and our men not knowing where to land nearer then <HI>Narragan&s;et.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly. It was alledged that if our Army landed at Narra|gan&s;et, they would come upon their Backs, and po&s;&s;ibly might &s;ur|prize them unawares; at wor&s;t they &s;hould be on firm Land as well as the enemy.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e rea&s;ons, the Councill of Warr, all of them except the Captain, were at a &s;tand, and could not judg it meet to &s;ail to <HI>Narragan&s;et.</HI> Capt. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI> in this difficult ca&s;e, went to the Reverend Mr. <HI>Samuel Stone,</HI> late Teacher to the Church of Chri&s;t at <HI>Hartford,</HI> who was &s;ent as Preacher to the Army, and de&s;ired him that he would that night commend their ca&s;e and difficultyes before the Lord, and &s;eek direction of him in the matter, how and in what manner they &s;hould demean them&s;elves. He retired him&s;elf from them aboard the Pink the remaining part of that day, and the follow|ing night was not wanting in &s;preading the ca&s;e before the Lord, and &s;eeking his direction, in the morning he came on &s;hore to the Cap|tains chamber, and told him he had done as he de&s;ired him, (and though formerly he had been again&s;t &s;ailing to <HI>Narragan&s;et</HI> and land|ing there, yet now he was fully &s;atisfied to attend it.</P>
<P>The Councel being again called, and the matter debated, &amp; rea|&s;ons con&s;idered, they agreed all with one accord to &s;ail to <HI>Narragan|&s;et,</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="18"> which the next morning they put in execution, which proved very &s;ucce&s;full, as the &s;equel may evidently demon&s;trate. What &s;hall I &s;ay? God led his people through manifold Difficultyes and Turnings, yet by more then an ordinary hand of Providence, <HI>He led them in a right way.</HI></P>
<P>On Friday morning, they in pur&s;uance of their de&s;ign &s;et &s;ail for <HI>Narragan&s;et Bay,</HI> and on Saturday toward evening they arrived at their de&s;ired Port, where they kept the Sabbath.</P>
<P>On Munday the wind blew &s;o hard at Norwe&s;t that they could not go on &s;hoar, as al&s;o on Tuesday till it was near Sun&s;et, but the wind abating, they and their de&s;ign being commended to God by Mr. <HI>Stone,</HI> Capt. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI> and his Company landed, and marched up to the place of the chief Sachims re&s;idence, and told him, that they had not an op|portunity before, to acquaint him with their coming armed into his countrey, yet they hoped it would be wel accepted by him, there being amity between us and them, and al&s;o that the <HI>Pequots</HI> and they were enemies, and that he could not be unacquainted with tho&s;e intolerable wrongs and injuries, tho&s;e <HI>Pequots</HI> had lately done unto the Engli&s;h, and that they were now come (God a&s;&s;i&s;ting) to avenge our&s;elves upon them, and that they did only de&s;ire free pa&s;&s;age through his countrey.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sachim</HI> returned this An&s;wer, that he did accept of their com|ing, and did al&s;o approve of their de&s;igne, only he thought our numbers were too weak to deal with the enemy, who were (as he &s;aid) very great Captains, and men skilful in war, thus he &s;pake &s;omewhat &s;lightingly of our men.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day morning they marched from thence, to a place called <HI>Niantick,</HI> it being about eighteen, or twenty miles, di&s;tant, where another of tho&s;e <HI>Narragan&s;et</HI> Sachims lived in a Fort, it being a frontier to the <HI>Pequots.</HI> They carried it very proudly to our men, not permitting any of them to come into their fort.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI> beholding their carriage, and knowing the fal&s;hood of the Indians, fearing le&s;t they might di&s;cover them to the enemy, e&s;|pecially the Indians having many times &s;ome of their neer relations a|mong&s;t their greate&s;t Foes, &s;aw cau&s;e to &s;et a guard about their fort that no Indian might pa&s;s in or out, and charged the Indians not to pa&s;s out upon the peril of their lives. And there they Quartered that night, the Indians not offering to &s;tir out all the while.</P>
<P>In the morning came to the Army &s;everal of <HI>Miantinomie</HI> his men, who told them they were come to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in the expedition, which encouraged diver&s;e Indians of that place to engage al&s;o, who drawing
<PB N="30" REF="19"> into a ring, one by one, made &s;olemn prote&s;tation how gallantly they would demean them&s;elves, and how many men they would kill.</P>
<P>On Thur&s;day, about eight of the Clock in the morning, they mar|ched thence towards <HI>Pequot,</HI> having about <HI>five hundred Indians</HI> with them. In which march, through the heat of the weather, and want of provi&s;ion, &s;ome of our men fainted; but when they had marched a|bout twelve miles, they came to <HI>Pawqatuck</HI> River to a Foord, where the Indians &s;aid the Pequots did u&s;ually fi&s;h. There they made a &s;tand and &s;tayed &s;ome &s;mall time; but the <HI>Narragan&s;et</HI> Indians manife&s;ted great fear, and many of them returned, although they had de&s;pi&s;ed our men, and &s;aid they dur&s;t not look upon a <HI>Pequot,</HI> and vaunted what great things they them&s;elves would do.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>John Ma&s;on</HI> &s;aw rea&s;on then to acquaint the Indians that they were come on purpo&s;e, and were re&s;olved (God a&s;&s;i&s;ting) to &s;ee the <HI>Pequots,</HI> and to fight with them before they returned, although they peri&s;hed; and then he enquired of <HI>&V;ncas</HI> what he thought the Indians would do; who &s;aid the Narragan&s;ets would all leave them, but as for him&s;elf, he would never leave them, and &s;o it proved.</P>
<P>After they had there refre&s;hed them&s;elves with their mean Com|mons, they marched about three miles, and came to a field which had been planted with Indian corn, where they made another Alt: and &s;uppo&s;ing that they drew neer to the enemy, who, as they were informed, had two forts almo&s;t impregnable, which did no ways di&s;|courage the &s;ouldiers, but rather animated them, in&s;omuch that they re&s;olved to a&s;&s;ault both the forts at once; but the Council of War ha|ving con&s;ulted the matter, under&s;tood that one of the forts, in which the bloodie&s;t Sachim re&s;ided, was &s;o remote that they could not po&s;&s;i|bly come up with it in &s;ea&s;on, and &s;eeing &s;ome of the &s;ouldiers &s;pent in the march with extream heat, and want of nece&s;&s;aries, concluded and re&s;olved to a&s;&s;ault, and &s;torm the neare&s;t fort.</P>
<P>Then they <HI>marched</HI> on in a <HI>&s;ilent manner;</HI> The Indians that remai|ned, who in the march hitherto kept the Van, (being &s;urpri&s;ed with great fear) fell all into the Reer. They continued their March till about an hour in the night, &amp; then coming to a little Swamp between two hills, there they pitched their little Camp, being much wearied with hard travell; &s;uppo&s;ing (by the Relations of the <HI>Indians</HI>) they were near the Fort, which proved otherwi&s;e. The rocks were their pillows, yet re&s;t was &s;weet and plea&s;ant to them. The night proved comfortable being clear and Moonlight. They appointed their Guards, and placed their Sentinels at &s;ome di&s;tance, who heard their
<PB N="31" REF="19"> enemies, &s;inging in their Fort until midnight, with great in&s;ulting and rejoycing (as they were afterwards informed by <HI>Wequa&s;h</HI> a <HI>Pequot</HI> Cap|tain, who was revolted from the Pequots, and was one of their Guides in this march) For they &s;eeing our pinnaces &s;ail by them a few days be|fore concluded they were afraid of them, and dur&s;t not to come near them.</P>
<P>Towards morning Captain <HI>Ma&s;on</HI> being awakened, and &s;eeing it very light, &s;uppo&s;ed it had been day, and &s;o they might have lo&s;t their opportunity, having determined to make their a&s;&s;ault before day and therefore immediately rou&s;ed up his Souldiers, and briefly com|mended them&s;elves and De&s;igne to the guidance and Protection of the Lord, and went to the a&s;&s;ault.</P>
<P>Their Indian Guide &s;hewing them a path &s;aid it led directly to the Fort; they took the path, and marched on the be&s;t part of two miles, wondering that they &s;aw not the Fort; and fearing that their Indian Guide might delude them; but coming to a place where corn was newly planted at the foot of a great hill, &s;uppo&s;ed the Fort was not far off, a champion Country being round about them. There the Captain cau&s;ed his Company to make a &s;tand, and gave order that the Indians &s;hould come unto him; at length <HI>&V;ncas</HI> &amp; <HI>Wequa&s;h</HI> came up, of whom he demanded where the Fort was, they an&s;wered, on the top of that Hill: He al&s;o enquired where the re&s;t of the Indians were; they an&s;wered behind exceedingly afraid; he then de&s;ired them to tel the re&s;t of their fellowes that they &s;hould by no means fly, but &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">nd at what di&s;tance they plea&s;ed, and &s;ee whether Engli&s;h men would now fight or not. Then Capt. <HI>&V;nderhill</HI> came up into the Front, &amp; after Capt. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI> had commended their ca&s;e to God (their being two entrances into the Fort, they divided their men; &amp; Capt. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI> lead up to that entrance on the North-ea&s;t &s;ide, who approaching with|in a rod of the entrance a dog bark'd, and an Indian cryed <HI>Wanux wa|nux.</HI> He commanded his Souldiers to clo&s;e up to the Fort, and fire upon them through the palizadoes, which they did, the Indians be|ing in a dead and indeed in their la&s;t &s;leep. The Souldiers having fired wheeled off and came to the main entrance, which was blocked up with bu&s;hes about brea&s;t high, over which Capt. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI> very couragiou&s;ly leaped, and &s;tood to make good the entrance, and com|manded his Souldiers to follow him, one of which endeavouring, was entangled in the bu&s;hes, but getting back, pulled out the bu&s;hes and &s;o the Souldiers followed their Captain into the Fort with their Swords drawn; for they had concluded to de&s;troy them with the
<PB N="32" REF="20"> &s;word, and &s;o to &s;ave the plunder.</P>
<P>The Indians as yet kept their <HI>Wigwams;</HI> Capt. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI> entred a Wigwam, and his Guard not &s;eeing him, pa&s;&s;ed away from him, where he was &s;trongly a&s;&s;aulted by many Indians, but he bravely de|fended him&s;elf, and &s;lew &s;everal of his oppo&s;ers; at la&s;t <HI>William Heyden</HI> perceiving the place where the Captain went in, e&s;&s;ayed to go in him&s;elf, but in his entrance &s;tumbled upon a dead man, but &s;oon recovering him&s;elf, he fel upon the Indians. The Indians &s;ome were &s;lain, &s;ome fled, others crept under their beds, where they &s;lept their la&s;t; the Captain going out of the Wigwams met with many of them and put them to the &s;word; In which time of fight &s;everal Engli&s;h were wounded. Capt. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI> perceiving his men wounded, and the ene|my not yet routed, &s;aw cau&s;e him&s;elf to go into a wigwam, and fetch out a firebrand, and putting it in one of the mats with which the wig|wams were covered, commanded one of his &s;ouldiers to throw &s;ome powder upon it, which &s;et the mat on fire, which the wind taking; it was quickly throughly kindled, which made the Indians run as men mo&s;t dreadfully amazed.</P>
<P>And Indeed &s;uch a dreadfull terror did the Almighty let fall upon their &s;pirits, that they would fly from the &s;word, and ca&s;t them&s;elves into the very flames, where many of them peri&s;hed.</P>
<P>The fort being fired, the Captain commanded that all &s;hould march out of the fort, and &s;urround it; which was readily attended by all, only one <HI>Arthur Smith</HI> was &s;o wounded that he could not move out of the place, who was happily e&s;pyed by Leiut. <HI>Tho. Bull,</HI> and by him re&s;cued from the flames, which otherwi&s;e had con&s;umed him.</P>
<P>The fire was kindled on the <HI>Northea&s;t</HI> &s;ide to windward, which did &s;wiftly over run the whole Fort, to the extream amazement of the ene|my, and great rejoycing of our &s;ouldiers; &s;ome of the enemy climbed to the tops of the pallizadoes, where they were &s;hot down, others ga|thered to the windward &s;ide of the Fort, and lay pelting at our men with their arrows, who repaied them with their &s;mal &s;hot, others of the &s;toute&s;t i&s;&s;ued forth of the Fort, about fourty of them who fell by the &s;word.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>&V;nderhil</HI> and tho&s;e with him acted their parts in this trage|dy, e&s;pecially one Mr. <HI>Hedge,</HI> who was the fir&s;t that entred that gate to which Capt. <HI>&V;nderhil</HI> led up; the fire was no &s;ooner kindled but the &s;moke and flames were &s;o violent, that they were con&s;trained to de&s;ert the Fort and keep them in.</P>
<PB N="33" REF="20">
<P>Thus were they now at their wits end, who not many houres before exalted them&s;elves in their great pride, threatning and re&s;olving the utter ruin and de&s;truction of all the Engli&s;h, exulting and rejoicing with &s;ongs and dances; but God was above them, who laughed his enemyes and the enemyes of his people to &s;corn, making them as a fiery oven; thus were the &s;tout hearted &s;poiled, having &s;lept their la&s;t &s;leep, and none of their men could find their hands; thus did the Lord judge among the heathen, filling the place with dead bodyes.</P>
<P>And here we may take notice of Gods judgement upon this bloody Generation, in &s;ending the very night before the a&s;&s;ault an hundred and fifty men from their other fort to join with this fort, who were de&s;ign|ing (as &s;ome of them&s;elves have related) to go forth again&s;t the Engli&s;h at that very in&s;tant when this &s;troke came upon them, where the mo&s;t of them peri&s;hed with their fellows, &s;o that the mi&s;chief they inten|ded again&s;t us came upon them&s;elves; they were taken in their own &s;nare and we through the mercy of God e&s;caped. And thus in little more then one houres &s;pace was their Impregnable <HI>fort,</HI> with them&s;elves utterly de&s;troyed, to the number of <HI>five or &s;ix hundred,</HI> as hath been confe&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Pequots</HI> who e&s;caped. There were &s;even taken captive, and about <HI>eight</HI> e&s;caped; and <HI>of the Engli&s;h</HI> there were <HI>two &s;la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">n</HI> outright, and above <HI>twenty wounded.</HI> Some of our &s;ouldiers fain|ted for want of &s;uch comforts and nece&s;&s;aryes as were needful in &s;uch a ca&s;e. The Chyrurgion was much wanted, who was left with the Barks in Narragan&s;et Bay, with order there to remain until the night before they intended the a&s;&s;ault.</P>
<P>And thereupon grew many difficultyes among&s;t the Army, their pro|vi&s;ion and ammunition being neer &s;pent, and they in the enemyes coun|trey, who did far exceed them in numbers, being much enraged, and mo&s;t of our Indian friends having left them, and our pinnaces at a great di&s;tance from them, and their coming uncertain.</P>
<P>But as they were con&s;ulting what cour&s;e to take, it plea&s;ed God to di&s;cover our ve&s;&s;els to them under a fair Gale of wind &s;ailing into the <HI>Pequot</HI> Harbour, to their great rejoicing.</P>
<P>They had no &s;ooner di&s;covered our ve&s;&s;els, but immediately came up the enemy from the other fort about three hundred of them. Capt. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI> led forth a file or two of men to &s;kirmi&s;h with them, which &s;topt their Carrier, and put them to a &s;tand, and then they prepared to march towards our ve&s;&s;els, but four or five of our men were &s;o wounded that they were fain to be carried, with the Armes of about twenty more which took up &s;o many of the &s;ouldiers, that there was not above forty
<PB N="34" REF="21"> men free, but at length they hired &s;everal Indians to carry the woun|ded-men, who ea&s;ed them of that burthen, and carried their woun|ded men for them.</P>
<P>And when the &s;ouldiers had marched about a quarter of a mile, the enemy came to the place where the for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> had &s;tood, and when they beheld the ruines thereof, and the carca&s;es of their friends lye &s;ome upon the earth, others &s;corched, and &s;ome almo&s;t con&s;umed, with the fire, they &s;tamped and tore the hair from their heads, and ran mouting down the hill in their full Carreer, and the lo&s;s they met withal made them wary not to come near.</P>
<P>The &s;ouldiers then meeting with a &s;mall brook at the foot of the hil being very dry, &s;at down and refre&s;hed them&s;elves, the enemy being grown by this time &s;o wary they dur&s;t not come too neer, to di|&s;turb them.</P>
<P>Then they marched on towards <HI>Pequot</HI> Harbour, and meeting with-&s;everal <HI>Wigwams</HI> in the way they burnt them; the enemy followed them, and &s;ome lay in ambu&s;h behind rocks and trees, often &s;hooting at them, yet God &s;o covered them, that not one of them was hurt, and when they came to any &s;wamp or thicket, they made &s;ome &s;hot, and cleared a pa&s;&s;age, and &s;ome of the enemy fell, which our Indians &s;ee|ing, would give a great &s;hout, and then venture to fetch their heads, and thus they continued, till they came within two miles of Pequot Harbour, where the enemy gathered them&s;elves together, and left our army; they marched on to the top of an hill adjoining to the har|bour, with their colours flying, (as for their Drum, it was lo&s;t, or at lea&s;t left by their Drummer at the place where they kept their ran|dezvouze the night before) where they &s;aw our ve&s;&s;els riding at An|chor to their great rejoicing, and when they had marched to the wa|ter &s;ide, there they &s;at down in quiet.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Patrick</HI> being there arrived (with our ve&s;&s;els) with forty men &s;ent by the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets</HI> Colony upon &s;ome &s;ervice again&s;t the block-I&s;landers or Pequots, came to the &s;hore in a &s;hallop, with &s;ome of his men, as he &s;aid, to re&s;cue our Army, &s;uppo&s;ing they had been pur|&s;ued, although there did appear no &s;ign of any &s;uch thing.</P>
<P>But Capt. <HI>Patrick</HI> could not be prevailed with by any means to ven|ture him&s;elf on &s;hore while our wounded men were carried on board, which was trouble&s;ome, not only to our &s;ouldiers, but to his own men al&s;o, who manife&s;ted their di&s;like of his carriage; at length our men were fetched aboard our ve&s;&s;els, to the great rejoicing of their friends, where they did with one heart ble&s;&s;e the Lord, for his mercy &amp; good|ne&s;s unto them.</P>
<PB N="35" REF="21">
<P>I might here relate a conte&s;t that fel out between Capt. <HI>&V;nderhill</HI> and Capt. <HI>Patrick,</HI> about Capt. <HI>&V;nderhil's</HI> claiming an Intere&s;t in the Bark in which Capt. <HI>Patrick</HI> &s;ailed, which by the mediation of Capt. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI> was i&s;&s;ued, and that being the place of Randezvouze, where ve&s;&s;els were expected from the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets,</HI> it was agreed that Capt. <HI>Patrick</HI> &s;hould there ride in that Bark, and &s;ecure the <HI>Narragan&s;et</HI> Indi|ans untill our ve&s;&s;el could carry our wounded men to <HI>Seybrook,</HI> and our Pink return to carry home the <HI>Narragan&s;et</HI> Indians.</P>
<P>After this agreement, Capt. <HI>&V;nderhill</HI> &s;et &s;ail for <HI>Seybrook</HI> in our Bark, but before he was out of &s;ight, Capt. <HI>Patrick</HI> &s;ignified by writing to Capt. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI> that he could not attend that Service he had ingaged for he mu&s;t with his company wait at <HI>Seybrook,</HI> for &s;ome ve&s;&s;els he ex|pected from the Bay; advi&s;ing Capt. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI> &s;eeing he had obtained the honour of that Service, he would compleat it in &s;ecuring the <HI>Nar|ragan&s;et Indians, &amp;c.</HI> Which indeed was a hard task and difficult; for the Pink could not entertain them, and to march by land was dan|gerous, it being near twenty miles, and in the enemies country, and their numbers being &s;mall; for they had &s;ent home about twenty men to h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">lp &s;trengthen the Plantations on <HI>Connecticut,</HI> for fear of the <HI>Pe|quods</HI> invading of them, but at la&s;t, &s;eeing they were nece&s;&s;itated to march to <HI>Seybrook</HI> by land, they went a&s;hoar with the Indians, and be|gan their march; Capt. <HI>Patrick</HI> &s;eeing what they were about, came a|&s;hoar al&s;o with his men; and although Capt. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI> told him he did not delight in his company, yet he would and did march along with them.</P>
<P>In their march, about the mid-way between that and <HI>Seybrook,</HI> they fell upon a people called <HI>Nianticks,</HI> belonging to the <HI>Pequots,</HI> who fled to a &s;wamp for refuge; but when they heard or &s;aw this &s;mall troop they fled, who pur&s;ued them awhile by their track as long as they kept together; but the day being much &s;pent, Sabbath drawing on, &amp; them&s;elves much &s;pent with their former travel, and &s;ervice, they left their pur&s;uit, and marched on towards <HI>Seybrook,</HI> and about &s;un-&s;et they arrived by <HI>Connecticut</HI> River &s;ide; where they were welcomed by Lieut. <HI>Gardner,</HI> with many great Gunns, but were forced there to take up their Quarters that night. On the morrow morning they were all fetched over, where they kept the Sabbath, and were nobly entertai|ned by Lievt. Gardner, from whom they received many Courte&s;ies.</P>
<P>And when they had taken order for the &s;afe conduct of the <HI>Narra|gan&s;et</HI> Indians to their Country, Capt. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI> with his men returned to <HI>Connecticut</HI> the place of their abode, where they were entertained with
<PB N="36" REF="22"> great triumph, and rejoycing and prai&s;ing of God, for his goodne&s;s to us in &s;ucceeding our endeavours, in crowning them with &s;ucce&s;s, and in re&s;toring our &s;mall Army with &s;o little lo&s;s.</P>
<P>Thus was God &s;een in the mount, cru&s;hing his proud enemies, and the enemies of his people, &s;o that they who were ere while a terror to all that were round about them, who re&s;olved to de&s;troy all the En|gli&s;h, and to root their very name out of this Country, were by weak meanes thus vanqui&s;hed and de&s;troyed, and the mi&s;chief they plotted, and the violence they offered, was brought upon their own heads in a moment; for the Lord burnt them up in the fire of his wrath, &amp; dung|ed the ground with their fle&s;h, it was the Lords doing, and it is marve|lous in our eyes. It is He that hath made His work wonderfull, and therefore ought to be remembred.</P>
<P>Suddenly after this, the whole Body of the remaining <HI>Pequots</HI> re|paired to that Fort where <HI>Sa&s;&s;acous</HI> the chief Sachim did re&s;ide, and charged him that he was the only cau&s;e of all their troubles that be|fell them, and therefore they would de&s;troy both him and his; yet by the entreaty of his Coun&s;ellors, they &s;pared his life; and con&s;ulting what cour&s;e to take, concluded there was no abiding any longer in their Country, and &s;o re&s;olved to fly into &s;everal parts. The greate&s;t body of them went towards <HI>Manadus,</HI> and in their pa&s;&s;age over <HI>Con|necticut</HI> River, they met with three Engli&s;h men in a &s;hallop going for <HI>Seybrook,</HI> and fought them, who re&s;i&s;ted them &s;toutly, and killed &amp; wounded many of them, but their &s;hallop falling on ground, they were all three &s;lain.</P>
<P>About a fortnight after our &s;ouldiers were returned home from <HI>Mi|&s;tick</HI> Fight, we heard of the arrival of &s;everal ve&s;&s;els from the <HI>Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;ets Colony</HI> in Pequot River; Capt. <HI>I&s;rael Stoughton</HI> being Comman|der in chief, and with him about 120 men, who were &s;ent by that Co|lony to pro&s;ecute the War again&s;t the <HI>Pequots;</HI> and although the main Body of the <HI>Pequots</HI> were fled, yet &s;ome &s;traglers remained in that Country, &s;ome of whom were di&s;covered by the <HI>Moheags</HI> and by them di&s;covered to the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets</HI> Forces, by whom they were both &s;ur|pri&s;ed and taken, and &s;everal of which, to the number of about twenty three, were put to death; the re&s;t were &s;ent to the Bay.</P>
<P>The Colony of <HI>Connecticut</HI> hereupon &s;ent forth Capt. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI> again with forty men, as al&s;o &s;everal Gentlemen, (as the Honour'd <HI>John Haines</HI> &amp; <HI>Roger Ludlow</HI> E&s;qrs.) to meet with tho&s;e of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets</HI> to con&s;ult and determine what was further nece&s;&s;ary to be attended. who meeting with tho&s;e of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets</HI> in the <HI>Pequot</HI> harbour,
<PB N="37" REF="22"> after con&s;ultation, concluded to pur&s;ue the <HI>Pequots</HI> (who as you heard before were fled towards the <HI>Menados</HI>) and &s;o began their march after them, and di&s;covered &s;everal places where they had rendevowed and lodged not far di&s;tant one from the other, for they could make but little ha&s;t, by rea&s;on of their ancient people and children, and their want of provi&s;ion, being forced to gather clams, and &s;uch other things as the wilderne&s;s afforded for their relief. The ve&s;&s;els &s;ailed along by the &s;hore. In the march &s;ome were gleaned, but within the &s;pace of three dayes, or thereabouts, they arrived at a place then called <HI>Quinipiag</HI> (now <HI>New-haven</HI>) and there e&s;pying a great &s;moke in the woods, not far di&s;tant, &s;uppo&s;ing the <HI>Pequots</HI> might be there, they went to di&s;cover them; but they quickly di&s;covered them to be Con|necticut Indians. From thence they &s;ent a <HI>Pequot</HI> captive (whom they named <HI>Luz</HI>) upon di&s;covery, who brought them tidings of the enemy which proved real. The <HI>Pequots</HI> were &s;o terrified in their flight, that a <HI>Moheag</HI> Indian (named <HI>Jack Eaton</HI>) meeting in this pur&s;uit with three <HI>Pequots,</HI> took two of them and brought them to the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>But to return, they having tidings where the <HI>Pequots</HI> were, ha&s;tned toward the place where they heard they were, and at la&s;t coming into a corn field, &s;everal of the Engli&s;h e&s;pyed &s;ome Indians, who fled from them. They pur&s;ued them, and coming to the top of an hill, &s;aw &s;e|veral wigwams ju&s;t oppo&s;ite, only a &s;wamp intervening, which was almo&s;t divided in two parts. One Serjeant <HI>Palmor</HI> ha&s;tning with a|bout twelve men (who were then under his command) to &s;urround the &s;maller part of the &s;wamp that &s;o he might prevent the Indians fly|ing. But Lievt. <HI>Davenport,</HI> Serjeant <HI>Jefferyes &amp;c.</HI> going up to the <HI>Wigwams</HI> were there a&s;&s;aulted by the Indians. In this Skirmi&s;h the Engli&s;h &s;lew but few, two or three of them&s;elves were wounded, the re&s;t of their Army coming up, the &s;wamp was &s;urrounded.</P>
<P>Their Council being called, the que&s;tion was propounded how they &s;hould proceed? Capt. <HI>Patrick</HI> advi&s;ed that they &s;hould cut down the &s;wamp, (they having taken many Indian hatchets) Others propounded to hedge in the &s;wamp, which others judged would be to no purpo&s;e, and therefore &s;trongly oppo&s;ed it, Some other advi&s;ed to force the &s;wamp, having time enough (it being about three a clock in the afternoon) but that being oppo&s;ed, it was then propounded that the men &s;hould be drawn up clo&s;e to the &s;wamp, which would have le&s;ned the circumference, and then to fill up the open pa&s;&s;ages with bu&s;hes, that &s;o they might &s;ecure them till the morning, and then con|&s;ider farther about it. But neither of tho&s;e would pa&s;s, &s;o different
<PB N="38" REF="23"> were their apprehen&s;ions, which was very grievous to &s;ome, who con|cluded the Indians would make an e&s;cape in the night, as ea&s;ily they might, &amp; did, the &s;wamp being large and their numbers &s;o &s;mall that they were forced to &s;tand at a great di&s;tance one from another, which made their e&s;cape more ea&s;ie.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI> took order that the narrow pa&s;&s;age in the &s;wamp &s;hould be cut through, which would much &s;horten the leaguer, which was accordingly attended and re&s;olutely performed by Serjeant <HI>Davis</HI> and &s;ome others with him.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Thomas Stanton</HI> a man well acquainted vvith the Indians lan|guage and manners, perceiving the Coun&s;ell of War loth to de&s;troy Women and children, (as al&s;o the Indians of that place) freely offer|ed his &s;ervice to go into the &s;wamp and treat with them, vvhich the Councel were &s;omevvhat backward to, by rea&s;on of &s;ome hazard he might be expo&s;ed to, but his importunity prevailed, who going to them did in a &s;hort time come to the Councel with near 200. old men, women and Children, vvho delivered them&s;elves to the mercy of the Engli&s;h, mo&s;t of vvhich brought their &s;mall pre&s;ent with them, and laid it down before the Councell.

<P>But above halfe an hour before day the Indians that were in the &s;wamp, attempted to break through Capt. <HI>Patricks</HI> Quarters, But were beaten back &s;everal times; they made a great noi&s;e, as the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">r man|ner is at &s;uch times, which &s;ounded round about the league<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">; Capt. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI> &s;ent Serjeant <HI>Stares</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e again&s;t whom the Pequots pre&s;&s;ed to come out by, at which time al&s;o Capt. <HI>Trask</HI> came in to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but the tumult encrea&s;ing, the &s;iege was rai&s;ed, and they marching up to a place at a turning of the &s;wamp, the Indi|ans were forcing out upon them, but they fired upon them, and &s;ent them back by their &s;mall &s;hot; Then they waited a little for their &s;e|cond attempt, but the Indians facing about, and pre&s;&s;ing violently u|pon Capt. <HI>Patricks</HI> Quarters, brake through, and &s;o e&s;caped about &s;eventy of them, as the Indians informed; the &s;wamp was &s;earched; there were but few found &s;lain. The Captives that were taken were a|bout an hundred and eighty, which were divided between the two Colonyes, and they intended to keep them as &s;ervants, but they could not endure that yoke, for few of them continued any con&s;idera|ble time with their ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>'Thus did the Lord &s;catter his enemyes with his &s;trong arm.</P>

Another ve&s;&s;el coming from Connecticut, taken with a cro&s;s wind, intended to put in at <HI>Narragan&s;et,</HI> but could not; being therefore forced upon <HI>Block-I&s;land,</HI> they &s;aw a bark with her &s;ayls up, driving too and fro, they hailed her, but no An&s;wer was given; per|ceiving her full of Indians they &s;u&s;pected the Engli&s;h belonging to the Ve&s;&s;el were murdered, whereupon they di&s;charged their guns, &s;hooting bullets among&s;t the Indians, who, many of them immediately leaped overboard. The Ma&s;ter entred the Ve&s;&s;el, and lifting up a Cloth &s;aw an Engli&s;hman dead, and di&s;cerning that many Indians were &s;till in the hold, he returned to his own Ve&s;&s;el again, from thence pouring in &s;mall &s;hot upon the Indians, for a while, until the wind coming fair; he &s;ailed away to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> informing the Governour and Council there, concern|ing what he had &s;een, whence about an hundred Souldiers were forth|with &s;ent to <HI>Block-I&s;land.</HI> As they were landing, the Indians came down and &s;hot violently at them, wounding one man, but as &s;oon as one Engli&s;hman was landed, they ran away. The Engli&s;h pur&s;ued them two dayes, burning their Corn and Wigwams, but the Indians be|took them&s;elves to Swamps, thereby e&s;caping with their lives. After this they re&s;olved for the <HI>Pequot</HI> Country, having received &s;ome Intel|ligence of the In&s;olency and outrage of tho&s;e Indians. As they were &s;ailing up the River, many of the <HI>Pequots</HI> on both &s;ides of the River cal|led to them, de&s;irous to know what was their end in coming thither, they were told that they de&s;ired to &s;peak with <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;acus,</HI> one of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">r Sachems; the Indians &s;aid he was gone to <HI>Long-I&s;land;</HI> then it was de|manded that <HI>Momanottuck</HI> another of their Sachems &s;hould appear. It was pretended that he was not at home neither. The Engli&s;h went a &s;hore, and required the Indians to deliver up tho&s;e that had murder|ed Capt. <HI>Stone,</HI> It was An&s;wered, that they were al&s;o gone from home, but they would &s;end after them, and deliver them to Ju&s;tice, and that they might the better keep the Engli&s;h in parley, they &s;aid that their Sachem would pre&s;ently come and treat with them. In the mean time they tran&s;ported their goods, women and Children to another place.</P>
<P>At la&s;t one of the Indians declared plainly, that <HI>Momanottuck</HI> would not come. Immediately a Skirmi&s;h followed&punc; wherein one Indian was killed, and an Engli&s;h man was wounded. The Indians fled, the Eng|li&s;h pur&s;uing, &s;et fire to their Wigwams, and de&s;troyed their Corn, &s;o did they return to their Ve&s;&s;el. A few dayes after this, going on &s;hore
<PB N="45" REF="26"> again, as they were loading them&s;elves with Corn, the Indians violently a&s;&s;aulted them, &s;o that they were forced to leave their Corn and &s;tand to their Arms, At this time an Indian was killed and two Engli&s;h men &s;orely wounded. The Indians attempted the Ve&s;&s;els, but were entertained with &s;uch Volleys of &s;mal &s;hot as made them afraid to board any &s;o the Barks arrived &s;afe at <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">y-b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="3 letters"></HI> Fort.

Only three miles up the River two men going in a Canoo to &s;hoot Gee&s;e, the indians hear|ing the Report of their Guns, came upon them. Tho&s;e two Engli&s;h &s;ought to &s;ave their lives by padling, but the Indians pur&s;ued them with another Canoo &s;hot at them and wounded one in his head, who fell overboard, the other &s;hot &s;toutly at the Indians but at la&s;t being wounded and wearied, the Indians overtook him, he with his paddle cleft one of the Indians heads, but the re&s;t took h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">m, and tortured him to death.</P>
<P>Feb. 22.

<PB N="46" REF="27"> Arrows, and a third had one of his ribs cleft with an Arrow, &s;o that he died immeditaely.

Yea, the Lieut. him&s;elf was wounded in this Skirmi&s;h. After this the Indians kept Leaguer be|fore <HI>Say-brook</HI> Fort.</P>
<P>March. 9. A body of Indians, con&s;i&s;ting (as was conjectured) of two or three hundred came with in musket &s;hot of the Fort, challenging the Engli&s;h to come out and fight, mocking and upbraiding them with &s;uch words as the Engli&s;h u&s;ed when by them tortured to death, and bragged that they could kill Engli&s;h men <HI>all one flyes:</HI> But two great Gunns loa|den with Carthages of musket bullets being fired at them, away they wont, and hearing that the <HI>Narragan&s;ets</HI> were invading their country, they vi&s;ited <HI>Seybrook</HI> no more.</P>
<P>After the&s;e things, a &s;hallop coming down from Connecticut, with three men rowing, was &s;et upon by &s;everal canoes of Indians, the En|gli&s;h fought &s;toutly &s;o long as they could, but one of them being &s;hot through the no&s;e, &s;o as the arrow went out at the crown of his head, fell overboard and dyed: The other two were taken by the Indians, who ripped them up from the bottom of the belly to the throat, and cleft them down the back throughout, and afterwards hung them up by the neck on a tree by the River &s;ide, that the Engli&s;h might &s;ee them as they pa&s;&s;ed by; the &s;hallop they drew a&s;hore and &s;et on fire.</P>
<P>May. 15. 1637.

He whom they took Pri&s;oner, was a perfideous Villain, one that could &s;peak Engli&s;h well, having in times pa&s;t lived in the fort, and knowing all the Engli&s;h there, had been at the &s;laughtering of all the Engli&s;h that were &s;laugh|tered thereabouts; He was a continual &s;py about the fort, informing <HI>Sa&s;&s;acus</HI> of what he &s;aw or could learn. When this bloody traitor was executed, his limbs were by violence pulled from one another, and bur|ned to a&s;hes; &s;ome of the Indian executioners barbarou&s;ly taking his fle&s;h, they gave it to one another, and did eat it, withall &s;inging about the fire.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o reported that before the <HI>Mi&s;tick,</HI> fight, a friendly Indian
<PB N="47" REF="27"> that was &s;ent thither as a &s;ecret &s;py, brought word that the <HI>Pequots</HI> were &s;inging, and dancing, and be&s;&s;ing their God, in that they &s;up|po&s;ed the Engli&s;h were gone from them; and that in the night the En|gli&s;h came upon them, they were fallen into a deep &s;leep, by rea&s;on of their long dancing the night before, and their &s;entinel was gone out of his place to light a pipe of Tobacco, ju&s;t as the Engli&s;h &s;urprized them, and when our &s;ouldiers gave fire there was not one that mi&s;&s;ed; the <HI>Pequots</HI> &s;o alarumed, in horrour and amazement, crying <HI>Wannocks Wannocks,</HI> i. e.

Al&s;o fourty Indians that were friends to the Engli&s;h were hurt in that en|gagement. It was &s;uppo&s;ed that no le&s;s then five or &s;ix hundred Pe|quot &s;ouls were brought down to Hell that day. Moreover, it is therein added, that as the Engli&s;h marched towards their ve&s;&s;els in the River, &s;till as they came near any &s;wamp, they &s;ent in a volley of &s;hot, le&s;t the enemy &s;hould haply be in ambu&s;h in tho&s;e dark plaees of the earth, and &s;ome Indians have related that the Engli&s;h did by that means kill more men of war in their marching away, then in the fight at the Fort, whereby al&s;o <HI>Sa&s;&s;acus</HI> his plot to cut off the Engli&s;h as they pa&s;&s;ed by &s;wamp-ambu&s;hments was utterly and happily fru&s;trated.</P>
<P>It is further &s;aid, that an Indian called <HI>Wequo&s;h</HI> did direct the Engli&s;h to the Fort at <HI>Mi&s;tick,</HI> which <HI>Wequo&s;h</HI> was by birth a Sachim of that place b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">t upon &s;ome di&s;gu&s;t received&punc; he went from the Pequots to the Narra|gan&s;ets, and became a chief Captain under <HI>Miantonimo;</HI> and that there were with tho&s;e eighty Engli&s;h Souldiers, who engaged in this expedi|tion again&s;t the <HI>Pequots,</HI> at fir&s;t four hundred Indians, whereof three hundred were <HI>Narragan&s;ets.</HI> The day before the fight there was &s;ome agitation which Fort &s;hould be fir&s;t a&s;&s;aulted, whether that of <HI>Mi&s;tick,</HI> or another eight miles further, where <HI>Sa&s;&s;acus</HI> him&s;elf re&s;ided.

After that they took a|nother Indian Captive who likewi&s;e engaged to lead the Engli&s;h upon the Pequots, but he directed them into a quite contrary way, for which his life was de&s;ervedly taken from him. But an Indian called <HI>Luz,</HI> who was before taken Captive by our Souldiers in the Pequot Country, with two other Indians that were his kin&s;men, promi&s;ed if the Engli&s;h would give him, and his kin&s;men their lives, He would conduct them to the Enemies they &s;ought after. He did &s;o, the Pequots with other Indians belonging to tho&s;e parts, were found near a Swamp, into which they did betake them&s;elves for &s;afety, upon the approach of the Engli&s;h Souldiers. After a while, an Indian came out of the Swamp un|armed, with a pre&s;ent of <HI>Wampam,</HI> The Engli&s;h declared to him that they came not to take away the lives of the Indians nor their goods, if they would deliver up the murtherers that were among&s;t them. After which ninety nine came forth with their Sachim, who offered as a pre|&s;ent all the E&s;tate he had to di&s;po&s;e of, and that was nothing but the Coat on his back, being a Bears Skin. He was &s;ent into the Swamp again to &s;ignify to the Pequots there lurking, that if they would bring forth the murderers it &s;hould be better for them, which they would not do, but at la&s;t profe&s;&s;ed they had lived together, and they would dy together</P>
<P>There were about &s;eventy or eighty Indians in the Swamp, among&s;t whom there were twelve murderers. So then the Engli&s;h be&s;ett the Swamp; and &s;hot in upon them, and the Indians at them, &s;ome of which were furni&s;hed with Guns. One in &s;pecial that was climbing up a Tree to &s;hoot at the Engli&s;h, was e&s;pyed by a Souldier, who &s;ent a Bullet into him before the other could make his &s;hot. In the night time the Indians brake away. Diligent &s;earch was the next day made in the Swamp for dead Indians, Not many, (as &s;ome have made Nar|ration) but &s;even, and no more could be found. As for the Captives a
<PB N="50" REF="29"> Guard was appointed to look after them, they were charged upon pe|ril of their lives not to attempt running away; yet one of them betook him&s;elf to his heels, but a Souldier &s;hot after him, and killed him, which &s;truck a Terror into the re&s;t of the Captives, that no man dur&s;t make an offer to e&s;cape.

<P>On May 8. A Dutch Sloop came by <HI>Saybrook</HI> Fort, having on Board an Indian Captive, who &s;aid &s;he was <HI>Momonottocks</HI> Squaw. The Eng|li&s;h there de&s;ired the Dutch-men to let them have the Squaw in order to redeeming the Engli&s;h Captives, offering to give them to the value of two hundred pound, provided that tho&s;e Capt ves might be &s;et at li|berty. The Dutchmen hoping to gain much by &s;uch an Indian were &s;ome of them loth to part with her. In Conclu&s;ion Capt. <HI>&V;nderhil</HI> (who then commanded the Fort) having obteined the Con&s;ent of the Ma&s;ter of the Ve&s;&s;el, did <HI>Vi &amp; armis</HI> take the Squaw out of the Sloop. Afterwards when the <HI>Moheags</HI> came to <HI>Saybrook</HI> that Squaw appeared to be one belonging to them, whom the <HI>Pequots</HI> had Captivated, and &s;he made the Dutch believe &s;he was <HI>Momonottocks Squaw,</HI> hoping that thereby &s;he &s;hould obtein the more courteous u&s;age among&s;t tho&s;e into who&s;e hands &s;he was fallen, &s;o that the conte&s;t between the Engli&s;h and Dutch about her was needle&s;s.

The <HI>Pequots</HI> on &s;hore called to them, declaring that if they would come to an Anchor, the Engli&s;h Captives &s;hould be brought to them, which was done, and the men whom the Dutchmen had &s;ecured in their Sloop given in Exchange for the Engli&s;h Captives, who were al&s;o brought &s;afe to <HI>Saybrook,</HI> May, 16. where our Souldiers waited for a wind to carry them to engage with

<P>Some have thought that in the&s;e Narratives, there is not due notice taken of what was done by the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et</HI> Forces. The Truth is, the Conque&s;t obteined over the <HI>pequots</HI> was wonderfully the Lords doing, nor may we a&s;cribe much to man therein, yet mu&s;t it be acknowledged (and the Narratives deny it not) that Capt. <HI>&V;nderhil</HI> (and tho&s;e under his Command) who was &s;ent from the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets</HI> did acquit him&s;elf worthily, when the Indians at <HI>Mi&s;tick</HI> Fort were cut off.

It is then worthy our ob&s;ervation, that the guilty bloody <HI>Pe|quots</HI> after they had treacherou&s;ly murthered Capt. <HI>Stone</HI> and his Com|pany, brought pre&s;ents of <HI>Wampam</HI> and <HI>Bever</HI> to the Engli&s;h at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> de&s;iring their Friend&s;hip, pleading that <HI>Stone</HI> had (who was like e|nough to do it) offered &s;ome abu&s;e to them, in &s;urprizing divers Indi|ans, and binding them, and forcing them to &s;hew him the way up the River, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &mdash; wherefore a peace was concluded upon condition they would &s;uffer the Engli&s;h who de&s;ired to inhabit <HI>Connecticut,</HI> there qui|etly to live, and al&s;o deliver up tho&s;e men who had been guilty of <HI>Stones</HI> death. The&s;e things were not performed by the <HI>Pequots.</HI> The Rea|&s;on why they were the more willing to have peace with the Engli&s;h was, in that they were fallen out with the <HI>Dutch</HI> at <HI>Monhatus,</HI> as al&s;o with the <HI>Narrhagan&s;ets</HI> who were then potent and numerous; and at fir&s;t they thought &s;corn to make Overtures of peace to them, proudly de&s;igning the &s;ubjugation of all their neighbour Indians, which wrought well for the Engli&s;h.

For they told the <HI>Narragan&s;ets</HI> that if they joyned with the Engli&s;h, they did but make way for their own Ruine, &s;ince after the <HI>Pequots</HI> were conquered, they would find an occa&s;ion to fall upon the <HI>Narragan&s;ets,</HI> and that they &s;hould not need to come to open battel with the Engli&s;h, only fire their Hou&s;es, and kill their Cat|tel, and lye in ambu&s;h to &s;hoot them as they went about their occa&s;ions, &s;o would they quickly be forced to leave this Country, and the Indians in the mean while not expo&s;ed to any great hazard. Had the <HI>Narra|gan&s;ets</HI> been overcome by the&s;e Arguments, it would have occa&s;ioned far greater Trouble and hazard to all the Engli&s;h Colonyes, newly &s;et|led in this Land; But therefore God in mercy to his people prevented it. Commi&s;&s;ioners were then &s;ent from <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> into the <HI>Narragan&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">t</HI> Country, to endeavour that tho&s;e Indians might be kept from Comply|ance with the enemy. There is one who having a little enquired into the&s;e things, doth <HI>Relate</HI> that the old <HI>Kanonicus</HI> did di&s;&s;wade the Pe|quots from war, advi&s;ing rather to deliver up the murderers. They made believe as if they would do &s;o, and when a Band of Souldiers was &s;ent into the <HI>Pequot</HI> Country for that end, they bid them &s;tay a while, and the murderers &s;hould be brought to them, and certain Indians conver&s;ing with our Souldiers, did very much ob&s;erve the Armor which was upon them and would point where they &s;hould hit them with their Arrows, notwith&s;tanding. In fine, when a great Body of Indians ap|peared on an Hill not far off, tho&s;e that were with the Souldiers went over to them, when they all came together, they gave a &s;cornful &s;hout, and &s;o ran all away, making their boa&s;t to others, how they had deluded the Engli&s;h; So that <HI>Canonicus</HI> his advi&s;e to the <HI>Pequots</HI> took no effect. After which the <HI>Narragan&s;ets</HI> were not only prevailed with to decline joyning with the enemy, but (as is intimated in the above written Narrative) they pretended they would fight for the Engli&s;h; albeit when it came to in good earne&s;t, they proved them&s;elves Cowards do|ing little again&s;t the enemies except by unmanly in&s;ultations when they &s;aw them in mi&s;ery: For whereas it was cu&s;tomary with the <HI>Pequots,</HI> when they had overcome their enemies in&s;ultingly to tri|umph, &s;aying, <HI>O brave Pequots!</HI> The <HI>Narragan&s;ets</HI> &s;eeing them wounded or con&s;uming to death in their burning wigwams, would taunt

<P>What &s;pecial acts of valour were manife&s;ted by any of our <HI>Comman|ders</HI> or &s;ouldiers in this expedition, beyond what is expre&s;&s;ed in the forementioned <HI>Narrative,</HI> I am not able to <HI>Relate;</HI> Nor am I (though willing that mens vertues &s;hould be duely acknowledged) di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ay much on tho&s;e accounts, re&s;pecting &s;uch as are yet alive, as know|ing that however it may plea&s;e &s;ome by nouri&s;hing a proud humour, it would be nau&s;eous to others and deemed adulatory by wife and im|partial Readers.</P>
<P>Only I remember Capt. <HI>Davenport</HI> (that good man, who was after|wards Commander of the Ca&s;tle at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and there &s;lain by lighten|ing) once told me, that him&s;elf, with two or three more engaged with no le&s;&s;e then thirty Indians, and that there were &s;eventeen arrows &s;hot into his Coat, but having on a Coat of Male, none of tho&s;e ar|rows hurt him, only one that happened to &s;trike where he was not de|fended by his Coat.</P>
<P>Al&s;o he re&s;cued a poor &s;ouldier, that was in extream danger of be|ing devoured by tho&s;e Wolves; For two Ma&s;tive-Indians that lay in ambu&s;h, as a party of &s;ouldiers pa&s;&s;ed by, &s;uppo&s;ing they had been all pa&s;t, &s;natched hold of him whom they thought to be the la&s;t man, and were running away with him upon their &s;houlders, Capt. <HI>Daven|port</HI> followed them with his drawn Cutla&s;h, but &s;till as he lifted up his hand to &s;trike at them the&s;e <HI>Gigantine Salvages</HI> held up the poor man they were running away with, whereby for a while they &s;ecured their own bodyes from the blow, until at la&s;t mi&s;&s;ing the Engli&s;hman, Capt. <HI>Davenport</HI> &s;mote one of the Indians, whereupon they threw down their prey, and ran for their lives.</P>
<P>He that giveth account of this la&s;t pa&s;&s;age, doth al&s;o <HI>Relate</HI> another particular no le&s;&s;e plea&s;ant; namely, that whereas the <HI>Pequots</HI> ob&s;er|ved, that the Engli&s;h, being willing to &s;hew as much mercy as would &s;tand with ju&s;tice, did only captivate and not kill the <HI>Squaws,</HI> &s;ome great Indian Boyes would cry, <HI>I Squaw, I Squaw,</HI> thereby thinking to e&s;cape with their lives.</P>
<PB N="54" REF="31">
<P>But to be&s;erious. That which Governour <HI>Winthrop</HI> writeth in his Letter, publi&s;hed by Mr. <HI>Morton,</HI> is very memorable, <HI>viz.</HI> that in one &s;ight, though the Indians coming up clo&s;e to our men, &s;hot their Arrows thick upon them, &s;o as to pierce their hat brims, and their Sleeves, and Stockings, and other parts of their Cloaths, yet &s;o miraculou&s;ly did the Lord pre&s;erve them, as that (excepting three that ra&s;hly ventur|ed into a Swamp after them) not one of them was wounded. And tru|ly to &s;et a&s;ide carnal Con&s;iderations, there are two Rea&s;ons obvious, that may be a&s;&s;igned as cau&s;es of that glorious and &s;peedy &s;ucce&s;s, which God gave to the Engli&s;h again&s;t the <HI>Pequot</HI> Indians.</P>
<P N="1">1. The bla&s;phemy of tho&s;e Enemies. For &s;ome of them &s;aid, that Engli&s;h mans God was one Flye, which execrable bla&s;phemy the ble&s;&s;ed God would not bear from tho&s;e his Enemies. Al&s;o when &s;ome Engli&s;h were cruelly tortured to death by them, they would in a way of deri&s;ion bid them call upon God now, and bla&s;phemou&s;ly mock at them when they did &s;o. Therefore did the Lord bring tho&s;e bloody bla&s;|phemers in a moment down to Hell, yea, and damned them above ground, when they lay frying in the Fire that was kindled upon their hou&s;es, and making horrible Outcries.</P>
<P N="2">2. There was a mighty Spirit of Prayer and Faith then &s;tirring, both in tho&s;e that &s;taid at home, and in &s;ome that ventured their lives in the high places of the Field. That Reverend man of God Mr. <HI>Wil&s;on</HI> (who excelled in tho&s;e graces of Faith and Love) went forth with the Soul|diers that were &s;ent from this Colony. I think I have my &s;elf heard him &s;ay, (or if I have not, others have) that <HI>he was before he went out, as certain that God would give the Engli&s;h the &V;ictory over tho&s;e Ene|mies, as if he had &s;een the Victory already obteined.</HI> Such great Faith did the Lord &s;tir up in the Heart of that Holy man, and of other his Ser|vants, and by Faith did they <HI>turn to Fight the Armyes of the Aliens.</HI> So then, the&s;e Enemies being &s;ubdued, in &s;uch wayes and by &s;uch means as hath been expre&s;&s;ed, the Terror of God fell upon all the Heathen round about, and the Engli&s;h were dreadful to them: when they heard that the Engli&s;h had &s;lain, and taken Captive &s;even hundred Indians, and killed Thirteen <HI>Sachims,</HI> (who are their Kings) there was no more Spirit left in them. The <HI>Pequots</HI> be&s;t friends were afraid to receive &s;uch as fled to them for Refuge. But happy was he counted that could make friend&s;hip with the Engli&s;h, &s;o that two of the <HI>Sachims</HI> in <HI>Long-I&s;land</HI> came to that worthy Gentleman Captain (afterwards Lieut. Colonel) <HI>Stoughton,</HI> entreating that they might be under our protection. Al&s;o two of the <HI>Napannet</HI> Sachims, addre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to Governour <HI>Win|throp,</HI>

<P>Matters being again reduced to this peaceable &s;tate, that Land re&s;ted from war, and that for the &s;pace of almo&s;t forty years together. How|beit Jealou&s;ies among&s;t the Engli&s;h grounded upon Treacheries and Con&s;piracies among&s;t the Indians, (and &s;ome particular acts of Ho&s;tility and Outrages by them committed) there have been, more than once or twice, &s;ince the <HI>Pequot Troubles</HI> were ended.</P>
<P>For in Anno 1638. the publick peace was endangered by occa&s;ion of a murder committed by an Engli&s;h man upon an Indian. Thus it was. One <HI>Arthur Peach</HI> a young De&s;perado, who bad been a Souldier in the <HI>Pequot</HI> war, and done notable Service, being bold and forward in any de&s;perate Attempt after he was returned home he was loth to go to work, wherefore he re&s;olved to go to the Dutch Plantation, and enti|ced three per&s;ons, that were other mens &s;ervants, to run away with him. As they were travailing through the woods, they met a <HI>Narra|gan&s;et Indian&punc;</HI> and de&s;ired him to take a pipe of Tobacco, which the In|dian was willing to do, <HI>Peach</HI> told his <HI>Comrades,</HI> he would kill him; they were afraid to do that, but let him alone to do as he would. When he &s;aw his Time, He ran the Indian through with his Rapier, and took away his <HI>Wampam</HI> from him, &s;uppo&s;ing he had left him dead, but after they were gone, the Indian made a &s;hift to get home, where he dyed of his wound within few dayes; But told other Indians that &s;uch and &s;uch Engli&s;h-men had mortally wounded him; The <HI>Sachims</HI> therefore pre|&s;ently found out the&s;e men (only one of them e&s;caped) who had done the murder, and carried them away to the Engli&s;h, at <HI>Aquianet</HI> I&s;land, where they were examined and committed. In the mean time the <HI>Narragan&s;ets</HI> were about to ri&s;e in Arms, &s;ome of them conceiving that they &s;hould find the <HI>Pequots</HI> words true, that the Engli&s;h would fall up|on them, now the other were vanqui&s;hed. To be &s;hort, the murder be|ing confe&s;&s;ed by the partyes guilty, the Court in <HI>Plymouth</HI> did by ad|vice from Magi&s;trates and elders in the <HI>Bay,</HI> condemn and &s;ee executi|on done upon tho&s;e three <HI>Engli&s;h men</HI> for murdering that one Indian, whereupon the other Indians magnifyed the Ju&s;tice which they &s;aw among&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and peace was continued. Yet after this new fears and troubles did ari&s;e upon other accounts. For although the <HI>Narragan&s;ets,</HI> and the <HI>Moheags</HI> did Anno 1638. come under &s;olemn promi&s;e that they would not engage in a war, either among&s;t them&s;elves or with other Indians, until they had advi&s;ed with, and obteined appro|bation
<PB N="56" REF="32"> from the Engli&s;h, Neverthele&s;s <HI>Miantonimo,</HI> the chief <HI>Nar|ragan&s;et Sachim,</HI> was continually picking quarrels with the <HI>Moheags,</HI> de&s;igning to make them become his Va&s;&s;als. Some (<HI>viz.</HI> Mr. <HI>Gorges</HI> and Mr. <HI>John&s;on</HI>) have related that <HI>Miantonimo</HI> was &s;et on by certain <HI>vagabond Engli&s;h,</HI> known by the Name of <HI>Gortonians,</HI> who being deep Apo&s;tates from, and bitter enemies unto the wayes of Chri&s;t, profe&s;&s;ed by our Fathers, might ea&s;ily be induced to animate motions of that nature, However <HI>Miantonimo</HI> cho&s;e rather to accompli&s;h his ends upon the <HI>Moheags</HI> by Treachery, than by open war; and hired a <HI>Pe|quot</HI> Indian who was &s;ubjected to <HI>&V;ncas</HI> (the <HI>Moheags Sachim</HI>) to a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;inate him that was become his Lord, which the Indian attempted ac|cordingly; in&s;omuch as on a certain evening as <HI>&V;ncas</HI> was pa&s;&s;ing from one <HI>Wigwam</HI> to another, he was &s;hot into the arm by an arrow, but recovered the hou&s;e he intended, without receiving further hurt.</P>
<P>The Indian who was &s;u&s;pected about this matter, being called to an account about a great &s;umm of <HI>Wampam-peag,</HI> by him po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, could not give any tolerable account, how he came by his money, which augmented jealou&s;ies of his being hired by <HI>Miantonimo</HI> to kill <HI>&V;ncas. &V;ncas</HI> then made his complaint to the Engli&s;h; the i&s;&s;ue was, that <HI>Mi|antonimo</HI> and the &s;u&s;pected Indian came to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> where he was exami|ned, at fir&s;t in the pre&s;ence of <HI>Miantonimo,</HI> by who&s;e help he had framed an <HI>Artificial Lye,</HI> &s;aying, that one night as he came out of a thick &s;vvamp, <HI>&V;ncas</HI> de&s;ired him to &s;ay that he vvas hired by <HI>Miantonimo</HI> to kill <HI>&V;ncas,</HI> and that therefore he cut his arm vvith the flint of his Gun, that men might think he had been &s;hot with an arrow. This pittiful &s;tory made the Engli&s;h &s;u&s;pect <HI>Miantonimo</HI> more vehemently then ever, and upon a further private examination (much again&s;t <HI>Miantonimo</HI>'s mind) they &s;aw cau&s;e to believe that he was &s;ecretly de&s;igning mi&s;chief again&s;t the Engli&s;h, as well as again&s;t <HI>&V;ncas.</HI> Neverthele&s;s, it was thought be&s;t to di&s;mi&s;s him for the pre&s;ent, only with an engagement to remit the &s;u&s;pected <HI>Pequot</HI> to his Ma&s;ter <HI>&V;ncas:</HI> He contrary to his promi&s;e, as he was returning home cut off the poor <HI>Pequots</HI> head, where|by he was made uncapable of di&s;covering any thing further about matters between <HI>Miantonimo,</HI> and him.</P>
<P>Being come home, he forthwith re&s;olveth to be revenged upon <HI>&V;ncas,</HI> and with a thou&s;and <HI>Narragan&s;ets</HI> gave him battel, but the <HI>Moheags,</HI> (though not half their number) wor&s;ted the <HI>Narragan|&s;ets,</HI> and took <HI>Miantonimo,</HI> their chief Sachem, pri&s;oner, and brought him to the Town of <HI>Hartford,</HI> de&s;iring advi&s;e from the Engli&s;h con|cerning the di&s;po&s;al of him.

<P>In the fir&s;t place they endeavoured to play <HI>Leger de main</HI> in their &s;ending Ho&s;tages.

For I find upon publick <HI>Record,</HI> that complaints and informati|ons about that matter (in September, 1646) were brought before the Commi&s;&s;ioners then a&s;&s;embled at <HI>New-haven,</HI> where an Indian te&s;tified that <HI>Sequa&s;&s;on</HI> the <HI>Sachim</HI> of <HI>Waranoke,</HI> had given him a &s;um of money on condition that he would murther the Gentlemen mentioned.</P>
<P>Before the Commi&s;&s;ioners convened, Mr. <HI>Haines</HI> had twice &s;ent to <HI>Sequa&s;&s;on;</HI> but he neglected to make his appearance: Wherefore <HI>Jonathan Gilbert</HI> was &s;ent to him again, to &s;ignifie from the Commi&s;&s;io|ners that they expected <HI>Sequa&s;&s;ons</HI> appearance before them, and to an&s;wer what he was accu&s;ed with and they promi&s;ed him free pa&s;&s;age both to and from <HI>New haven,</HI> withall intimating that his withdrawing him&s;elf would greatly augment the &s;u&s;pition of his guilt.</P>
<P>The Me&s;&s;enger quickly returned, bringing word, that he could not &s;peak with <HI>Sequa&s;&s;on,</HI> who he &s;uppo&s;ed had received notice of his coming by other Indians, and was thereupon fled.</P>
<P>But a few days after, <HI>Nipni&s;oit</HI> and <HI>Naimetayhu</HI> two <HI>Sagamores,</HI> came with &s;ome other Indians to <HI>Newhaven,</HI> declaring that they were friends to <HI>Sequa&s;&s;on,</HI> and pretended great re&s;pect to the Engli&s;h, and that they had brought <HI>Sequa&s;&s;on</HI> to clear him&s;elf, and that although one of them had him by one arm, another by the other, when he was come near the town, he brake from them and was e&s;caped.</P>
<P>The Commi&s;&s;ioners told them they intended <HI>Sequa&s;&s;on</HI> no hurt; but de&s;ired to bring him and his accu&s;ers face to face, that he &s;hould have a ju&s;t bearing in their pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>Some other Indians informed that <HI>Sequa&s;&s;on</HI> was within a mile of <HI>Newhaven,</HI> and it was conceived that he would gladly make his peace by &s;ome other means, rather then by a due examination and Trial. The two <HI>Sagamores</HI> &s;aid he was much afraid, and dur&s;t not come, though they confe&s;&s;ed it was ju&s;t he &s;hould come and clear him&s;elf, if innocent; all which being con&s;idered, the Commi&s;&s;ioners conceived that <HI>Sequa&s;&s;on</HI> whether guilty or afraid of the Engli&s;h, would &s;till be plotting again&s;t them and &s;o prove dangerous; wherefore they thought fit, and ordered that all ju&s;t and prudent means &s;hould be u&s;ed (his life being pre&s;erved) to bring him to a tryal, that the matter might be &s;ome way i&s;&s;ued. In the mean time they thought good to examine <HI>Wotchiborow</HI> a <HI>Pocatuck</HI> Indian, <HI>Sequa&s;&s;ons</HI> accu&s;er, who waited to give in evidence again&s;t him. He being warned by <HI>Thomas Stanton</HI> the Interpreter, to &s;peak nothing but truth) affirmed, that being this la&s;t Spring at <HI>Waranoke,</HI> in a wig|wam with <HI>Sequa&s;&s;on,</HI> and ready to depart, <HI>Sequa&s;&s;on</HI> per&s;waded him to

<P><HI>Wotchiborow</HI> further &s;aith, that having taken the afore&s;aid <HI>wampam,</HI> he remembred that him&s;elf had formerly taken <HI>Bu&s;he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">g,</HI> and brought him to the Engli&s;h, who for a murderous attempt at <HI>Stanfo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d</HI> was put to death at <HI>Newhaven,</HI> that if he &s;hould kill any Engli&s;h Sachim he &s;hould goe in fear of death all the dayes of his life, and that for bring|ing in <HI>Bu&s;heag,</HI> he had a Gratuity from the Engli&s;h, and for the di&s;co|very of this plot he &s;hould have their favour, and he thought the fa|vour of the Engli&s;h with &s;ecurity, would be better to him then <HI>Sequa&s;&s;ons Wampam</HI> with fear and danger; he therefore came fir&s;t to <HI>Tunk&s;us</HI> and the next day to <HI>Hartford,</HI> and di&s;covered <HI>Sequa&s;&s;ons</HI> pra|ctice.</P>
<P>He &s;aid further, that <HI>Sequa&s;&s;on</HI> hearing of the di&s;covery, &s;pake to <HI>Romanoke</HI> an Indian, and he &s;ent another Indian called <HI>Sixpence</HI> to this Examinate, de&s;iring him to hide and conceal as much of the Plot as he could and not to &s;ay all open, but he in anger bad the &s;aid <HI>Sixp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nce</HI> hold his peace, he had di&s;covered it, and would hide nothing.</P>

<P>In Anno, 1647.

A Me&s;&s;enger was &s;ent to <HI>Nar|ragan&s;et,</HI> &s;ignifying to <HI>Pe&s;icus</HI> and other <HI>Sachims</HI> there, that the Engli&s;h Commi&s;&s;ioners expected their appearance at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and that if they
<PB N="64" REF="36"> did refu&s;e or delay, they &s;hould no more be &s;ent unto withal promi&s;ing them &s;afe conduct, in Ca&s;e they duly attended. The Me&s;&s;enger being returned informed that <HI>Pe&s;icus</HI> excu&s;ed his not meeting the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners at <HI>New Haven</HI> the la&s;t year, from his ignorance of the time. when he &s;hould attend, though that was fal&s;ly pretended by him. He al&s;o de&s;ired excu&s;e for his not appearing at this time, be|cau&s;e he &s;aid he was &s;ick, and not able to come, (but the Me&s;&s;engers could not perceive that he was &s;ubject to any &s;uch &s;ickne&s;s or disable|ment) Neverthele&s;s, he had given full power to <HI>Ninnigret</HI> to act on his behalf. Moreover, he excu&s;ed his not performing the <HI>Articles</HI> he had &s;ub&s;cribed at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> two years before, by pretending that he was frighted into that Engagement, with the &s;ight of the Engli&s;h Army, which was then ready to invade the <HI>Narragan&s;et</HI> Country, and he thought they would follow him home, and there kill him if he did not promi&s;e to do as the Engli&s;h would have him.</P>
<P>Augu&s;t 3. <HI>Ninnigret</HI> with &s;ome <HI>Niantick</HI> Indians, and two of <HI>Pe&s;|&s;icus</HI> his men came to <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI> At fir&s;t he (though again&s;t his Con&s;ci|ence) made as if he were ignorant, and never been informed of the Covenants which the Indians had made to the Engli&s;h, and &s;eemed to wonder that the Engli&s;h &s;hould ask &s;uch a Sum of <HI>Wampam,</HI> &s;aying that he knew not that the Indians were in the Engli&s;hmens Debt. He was then put in mind, how that formerly &s;atisfaction had been deman|ded of the Indians for the breach of Articles; and how the Engli&s;h Me&s;|&s;engers had been ill intreated by them, and particularly by him&s;elf, who had u&s;ed threatning and in&s;olent, language, &s;aying to the Me&s;|&s;engers, that he knew the Commi&s;&s;ioners would endeavour to keep them from warring upon <HI>&V;ncas,</HI> but they were re&s;olved they would do it for all that, and nothing but <HI>&V;ncas</HI> his head &s;hould &s;ati&s;fy them; and that if the Engli&s;h did not withdraw their Garri&s;ons from the De|fence of <HI>&V;ncas,</HI> they would heap up their Cattel as high as their <HI>wig|wams,</HI> and that he was the man that had given out that an Engli&s;hman &s;hould not &s;tep out of doors to pi&s;s but they would kill him. <HI>Ninigret</HI> not being able to deny the&s;e charges, and &s;omewhat appalled thereat, began to comply with the rea&s;onable demands of the Engli&s;h. A dayes time was allowed to him for Con&s;ideration and advice with the re&s;t of the Indian Deputyes that were then in <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI></P>
<P>The next day he declared that he was re&s;olved to give the Engli&s;h Colonies due Sati&s;faction in all things, and that he would forthwith &s;end &s;ome of his men to gather up the <HI>wampam</HI> which was yet behind hoping that within ten dayes it might be obtained, and that him&s;elf
<PB N="65" REF="36"> would &s;tay with the Engli&s;h as &s;ecurity, untill the money was paid.

This falling very much &s;hort of what was expected, <HI>Ni|nigret</HI> pleaded that his per&s;onal ab&s;ence from home was the cau&s;e of that defect, and therefore de&s;ired liberty to go home, withal adding, that if the whole were not paid by next &s;pring, the Engli&s;h &s;hould take his head, and &s;eize his Country. The Commi&s;&s;ioners let him depart, and &s;ince he pretended &s;o fair, did deliver to him the Children which were kept as <HI>Ho&s;tages,</HI> expecting from him, the more care to &s;ee engage|ments performed; and if they did find him real, that then former neg|lects &s;hould be charged upon <HI>Pe&s;icus,</HI> and that they &s;hould expect his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, when it &s;hould be required, in recovering the whole remain|der from <HI>Pe&s;icus,</HI> all which things were cheerfully accepted by <HI>Ninni|gret.</HI></P>
<P>This year other <HI>Troubles</HI> hapned by &s;ome of <HI>Vncas</HI> his Indians, who committed &s;everal Outrages upon the Engli&s;h in the <HI>Pequot</HI> Country.

Al&s;o Me&s;&s;engers from the Town of <HI>Warwick</HI> came with complaints in behalf of the whole Town, alleadging that their neighbour Indians did kill their Cattel, abu&s;e their &s;ervants when they took them alone, &amp; &s;ometimes would make forcible entry into their hou|&s;es yea and &s;trike the ma&s;ters thereof, and &s;teal, and purloyne their goods at plea&s;ure. At the &s;ame time, informations were brought before the Commi&s;&s;ioners, that the <HI>Naragan&s;it</HI> Indians, in&s;tead of paying the <HI>Wampam,</HI> that was due to the Colonyes, had improved their <HI>Wampam</HI> o hire Indians to invade <HI>&V;ncas,</HI> and in ca&s;e the Engli&s;h &s;hould defend
<PB N="62" REF="37"> him, to fight with them al&s;o. Particularly, that <HI>Ninnigret</HI> had given out, that if the Engli&s;h did protect <HI>&V;ncas,</HI> he would quickly burn the hou&s;es at <HI>Connecticut.</HI> The <HI>Narragan&s;ets</HI> were withdrawing their old men, women, and children into &s;wamps, hiding their corn <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The mercenary <HI>Mohawks</HI> were &s;aid to be about four hundred in number, all armed with guns, and three pound of powder for every man.</P>
<P>The&s;e Coun&s;ils were &s;o far ripened and prepared for execution, as that <HI>Thomas Stanton</HI> and other me&s;&s;engers from <HI>Connecticut,</HI> goeing to the Indians to enquire into, and (if it might be) &s;top proceedings, found them met at <HI>Pacomptuck</HI> their Rande<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">vouze, who acknowledg|ed that they had received <HI>Wampam</HI> from the <HI>Narragan&s;ets</HI> to invade <HI>&V;ncas,</HI> and that they were met together to that purpo&s;e, expecting <HI>Mohawks</HI> and other Indians to make up their full numbers: But hea|ring that two <HI>Mohawk</HI> Sachims, were lately killed by the Ea&s;tern In|dians, and that the Engli&s;h, who they thought were a ju&s;t and war|like people, would defend <HI>&V;ncas,</HI> they did therefore &s;top their inten|ded proceedings at this time.</P>
<P>But the&s;e things made it yet more evident, that the <HI>Narragan&s;ets</HI> were a fal&s;e and treacherous people, not to be tru&s;ted, nor worthy to be treated with.</P>
<P><HI>Ann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> 1649. <HI>Newhaven</HI> Colony was in apparent danger of being involved in trouble by rea&s;on of the Indians there: For at <HI>Stamford</HI> a man going forth to &s;eek his cattel returned not home as was expected, nor could be found by the Engli&s;h that &s;ought for him; but quickly after the Son of a <HI>Sagamore</HI> who lived near <HI>Stamford,</HI> came into the Town, and told the Engli&s;h that <HI>John Whitmore</HI> was murthered by an Indian called <HI>Toquattos,</HI> and to prove it, told them that <HI>Toquattos</HI> had &s;ome of his cloathes; and particularly his &s;hirt made of Cotton-linnen. Hereupon the Engli&s;h and &s;ome Indians went into the woods to &s;eek the murthered body for burial, but though they be&s;towed much time and labour, they could not find it. Diver&s;e of the Engli&s;h at <HI>Stamford</HI> &s;u&s;pected the <HI>Sagamores</HI> &s;on, to be either the Author or acce&s;&s;ory to the Murther, but had not &s;atisfiing grounds to &s;eize and charge him.</P>
<P>About two or three months after, <HI>&V;ncas</HI> coming to <HI>Stamford,</HI> calling the Indians thither, and enquiring after the murdered body, the fore|mentioned <HI>Sagam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">res</HI> Son, and another &s;u&s;pected Indian called <HI>K <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">horon</HI> fell a trembling, and hereby confirmed the &s;u&s;pition of the Engli&s;h, and wrought a &s;u&s;pition in &s;ome of the <HI>Mohegin</HI> Indians, &s;o that they &s;aid the&s;e two Indians were <HI>Matchet,</HI> meaning they were guilty. Notwith|&s;tanding the Indians thereabouts excu&s;ed the <HI>Sagamores</HI> Son, and accu|&s;ed
<PB N="67" REF="37"> <HI>Toquattos,</HI> &amp; intimated that if the Sagamores Son &s;hould upon &s;u&s;|pition be &s;eized on by the Engli&s;h, the Indians would doe the like by &s;ome Engli&s;h, untill he &s;hould be &s;et at liberty.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e at <HI>South-hampton</HI> in <HI>Long-I&s;land,</HI> the Engli&s;h were expo&s;ed to great difficulties and dangers by rea&s;on of a murder committed in that Town, &s;o that they were nece&s;&s;itated to <HI>Arm</HI> them&s;elves, and &s;tand upon their own defence for many dayes; the Indians being gathered to|gether in an ho&s;tile po&s;ture. This year al&s;o <HI>&V;ncas</HI> renewed his com|plaints again&s;t the <HI>Narragan&s;et</HI> Indians, that notwith&s;tanding all former engagements, they are &s;till undermining his peace, and &s;eeking his ruine, and in particular that to their late endeavour to bring the <HI>Mo|hawks</HI> upon him, when that failed, they &s;ought by witchcraft to take a|way his life. A <HI>Narragan&s;et</HI> Indian (called <HI>Cuttaquin</HI>) in an Engli&s;h Ve&s;&s;el in <HI>Mohegin</HI> River, ran a Sword into <HI>&V;ncas</HI> his brea&s;t, whereby he received to all appearance a mortal wound, which murderous act, the A&s;&s;ailant then confe&s;&s;ed, he was for a con&s;iderable &s;um of <HI>Wampam,</HI> by the <HI>Narragan&s;et</HI> and <HI>Niantick</HI> Sachims hired to attempt, <HI>Ninnigret</HI> when examined utterly denyed his having an hand in that fact but affir|med that <HI>Cuttaquin,</HI> who accu&s;ed him&s;elf, and the other Sachims, was drawn thereunto, by Torture from the <HI>Moheags,</HI></P>
<P>About four years after this (<HI>viz.</HI> in Anno 1653.) there were great <HI>Troubles,</HI> and Commotions rai&s;ed in the Spirits of men with reference to the Indians, it being generally believed that there was an horrid Con&s;pi|racy among&s;t the Indians throughout this Land to cut off all the Eng|li&s;h, and that they were animated thereto by the Dutch, there being at that time war between England and Holland. An Indian <HI>Squaw</HI> was &s;ent by other Indians (that profe&s;&s;ed love and friend&s;hip) to one in <HI>Whether field</HI> on <HI>Connecti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ut,</HI> informing that there was a Confederacy between the Dutch and indians, to de&s;troy the Engli&s;h Colonyes, and that the day of Election of Magi&s;trates in the &s;everal Jurisdictions was intended for execution, becau&s;e then the Towns would be left naked and le&s;s able to defend them&s;elves. This Squaw moreover de&s;ired the Engli h to remember, how dear their &s;lighting of her former informati|on of the <HI>Pequots</HI> coming had co&s;t them.</P>
<P>Al&s;o <HI>&V;ncas</HI> addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the Governour of <HI>Connecticut</HI> Co|lony declaring that <HI>Ninnigret</HI> had that winter been at <HI>Manhatos,</HI> and that he had given the Dutch Governour a great pre&s;ent of <HI>Wampam,</HI> and received from him twenty Gunns, with powder and &s;hot an&s;wer|able;
<PB N="68" REF="38"> and that during his &s;tay in tho&s;e parts he went over <HI>Hud&s;ons</HI> River, gathered as many <HI>Sachims</HI> together as he could, made ample Declaration again&s;t the Engli&s;h, de&s;iring their aid and a&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t them.</P>
<P>Yea moreover, there were no le&s;s then nine Indian <HI>Sagamores,</HI> who lived near <HI>Manhatos,</HI> did voluntarily without any notice or reward from the Eng<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;h, &s;end their Me&s;&s;engers to <HI>Stamford,</HI> declaring and af|firming (even after they were urged by the Engli&s;h to te&s;tifie nothing but the truth) that the Dutch had &s;ollicited them by promi&s;ing them Gunns, Swords, Powder, Wampam, Wa&s;t-coats and Coats to cut off the Engli&s;h. The Me&s;&s;engers added that they would not lye, &amp; were as the mouth of the nine Sagamores, who <HI>All &s;peak they no lye,</HI> they would affirm it to the Dutch Governours face, and if the Dutch were angry, and &s;hould fight with them, <HI>No force &amp;c.</HI> The next day, one of tho&s;e Sagamores, with the Son and Brother of another of them came them&s;elves to <HI>Stamford,</HI> and confirmed what their Me&s;&s;engers in their names had before reported.</P>
<P>This Spring al&s;o, the Indians in the <HI>Northern &amp; Ea&s;tern</HI> parts gene|rally grew in&s;olent, and their cariage very &s;u&s;pitious, and they gave out threatning words, &s;o that many Alarms were made, the peace of the Engli&s;h through the whole Country di&s;turbed, they wearied with ex|traordinary Watchings and Wardings, hindred in their Plowing, Sow|ing preparations for Planting and other Occa&s;ions, to their exceeding great Damage. The&s;e things cau&s;ed many &s;ad thoughts of hearts, and &s;ome warlike Preparations; but when the Partyes accu&s;ed were enqui|red of about the&s;e matters they would own nothing; as for <HI>Ninigret</HI> he pretended that his wintering among&s;t the Dutch was on the account of his health, and not at all out of de&s;ign again&s;t the Engli&s;h. The re&s;t of the <HI>Narragan&s;et Sachims</HI> made them&s;elves very ignorant of any Plot; the Dutch Governour likewi&s;e profe&s;&s;ed great abhorrency of &s;o vile a thing as that would be, to hire barbarous Indians to murder Chri&s;tians; withall adding, that if the Colonies fell upon him on that account, the righteous Judge would be his Defence, and that,</P>

<P>Al&s;o glad tidings of peace between the Nations at home arrived here &s;o did the&s;e troubles vani&s;h.</P>
<P>Albeit not many years after the&s;e things, the Indians in tho&s;e parts made an horrible &s;laughter, not of Engli&s;h-m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">n but of Dutch-men, who were treacherou&s;ly ma&s;&s;acred by them.</P>
<PB N="69" REF="38">
<P>In the latter end of this year it was, that the <HI>Montauket</HI> or Long-I&s;land Indians who were friends and Tributaryes to the Engli&s;h, com|plained that <HI>Ninnigret</HI> and the <HI>Nianticks</HI> had a&s;&s;aulted them, killing and taking Captive diver&s;e of them. They were &s;o far hearkned un|to, as that the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the united Colonies did apprehend them&s;elves called of God to wage Warr again&s;t <HI>Ninigret,</HI> and &s;uch Indians as &s;hould adhere to him in his bloudy proceedings, and accor|dingly did by vote conclude and determine the &s;ame, and that two hundred and fifty Souldiers &s;hould be forthwith rai&s;ed, and &s;ent forth by the &s;everal Colonies. But the Council at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> not concurring in tho&s;e Conclu&s;ions, the intended expedition failed at that time. Ne|verthele&s;s the next year, it being known that <HI>Ninnigret</HI> per&s;i&s;ted in his Warring upon the Long I&s;landers, and that he brake his Covenant, refu&s;ing to pay tribute for tho&s;e <HI>Pequots</HI> that were by the Engli&s;h for|merly placed under him, and that the lenity of the Colonies was ab|u&s;ed to heighten his pride and in&s;olency; upon the&s;e Con&s;iderations it was agreed by the Commi&s;&s;ioners that there &s;hould be two hundred and &s;eventy Foot Souldiers, and forty Hor&s;e, rai&s;ed out of the &s;everal Colo|lonyes, in order to reducing <HI>Ninnigret</HI> to &s;ubjection and better obedi|ence. Accordingly Forces were forthwith levied, and a &s;mall Army &s;ent forth under the Chri&s;tian and couragious Major <HI>Willard</HI> as Com|mander in chief.</P>
<P>Upon the approach of the Engli&s;h Army <HI>Ninnigret</HI> fled from the place of his u&s;ual Re&s;idence, and got into a Swamp, where it was not ea&s;ie to pur&s;ue him. Mo&s;t of the <HI>Pequots</HI> under his Jurisdiction then de&s;er|ted him, and came to the Engli&s;h. Me&s;&s;engers were &s;ent to demand a Treaty with him, but he was afraid to appear.</P>
<P>In fine, two Gentlemen, viz. Capt. <HI>Davis</HI> and Capt. <HI>Siely</HI> went to him requiring the delivery of the re&s;t of the <HI>Pequots;</HI> to whom he replyed that they were gone on hunting, but ingaged that within &s;even dayes they &s;hould be delivered to Mr. <HI>Winthrop.</HI> He was moreover charged to forbear all acts of Ho&s;tility again&s;t the Long-I&s;landers, or any other Indians that were in amity with the Engli&s;h; and plainly told, that if he did not hearken to the advice and charge laid upon him, he mu&s;t expect that ere long his head would be &s;et upon an Engli&s;h pole.</P>
<P>So did the Me&s;&s;engers return and the Army al&s;o. The&s;e things hap|ned in October Anno 1654.</P>
<P>After the Engli&s;h forces were withdrawn, <HI>Ninnigret</HI> did according to his u&s;ual manner, ob&s;erve <HI>Fidem punicam</HI> in keeping the promi&s;es which at that time he had made and &s;et his hand unto.</P>
<PB N="70" REF="39">
<P>Not many years after this the Indians in the Southern and We&s;tern parts of this Land were involved in broyles among&s;t them&s;elves, raging with implacable feuds and wars one again&s;t another. The <HI>Nianticks, Mauntaukets, Mohegins, Norwootucks,</HI> all engaged in cruel and bloody quarrels. And the peace of the&s;e Colonyes was not a little di&s;turbed and endangered thereby, ina&s;much as the Indians would pur&s;ue one a|nother to the Engli&s;h plantations, and &s;ometimes into the Engli&s;h hou|&s;es, and there kill one another. Some Engli&s;h at <HI>Wethersfield,</HI> and &s;ome inhabiting in the <HI>Moheag</HI> Country were by means hereof put in|to &s;ad frights. In &s;pecial, in Anno 1658, &s;undry Engli&s;h in divers pla|ces were disquieted by the in&s;olence and outrage of the <HI>Pacumptick</HI> In|dians. But when the <HI>Sachims</HI> were called to an account about it, they pretended that they were ignorant of what disorders were committed by their men, nor allowed of by them who de&s;ired to live in amity with the Engli&s;h, and were willing to give &s;atisfaction for pa&s;t injuryes, and to prevent the like abu&s;es for the Future. So did tho&s;e Troubles pa&s;s over. Not very long before this, at <HI>South-Hampton</HI> in <HI>Long I&s;land</HI> &s;ome hou&s;es had been burned by a wicked Indian (and a <HI>Negro</HI> wo|man) who it &s;eems after he had done this wic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">edne&s;s, de&s;perately killed him&s;elf, to prevent ju&s;t execution. It was at fir&s;t thought that more of the Indians there had had an hand in that burning, whence they were condemned to pay &s;even hundred pound in &s;even years, but afterwards that penalty was taken off, &s;ince it was judged unrea&s;ona|ble that tho&s;e Indians who were not proved to act in, or con&s;ent to the mi&s;chief that was done, &s;hould be made to &s;uffer as guilty.</P>
<P>In Anno 1662, <HI>Plymouth</HI> Colony was in &s;ome danger of being invol|ved in Trouble by the <HI>Wampanoag</HI> Indians. After <HI>Ma&s;&s;a&s;oit</HI> was dead, his two &s;ons, called <HI>Wam&s;utta,</HI> &amp; <HI>Metacomet,</HI> came to the court at <HI>Plymou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">h</HI> pretending high re&s;pect for the Engli&s;h, and therefore de&s;ired Engli&s;h names might be impo&s;ed on them, whereupon the Court there named <HI>Wam&s;utta</HI> (the elder brother) <HI>Alexander,</HI> and <HI>Metacomet</HI> (the younger brother) <HI>Philip;</HI> this <HI>Alexander (Philips</HI> immediate predece&s;&s;or) was not &s;o faithful and friendly to the Engli&s;h as his Father had been. For &s;ome of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> having been occa&s;ionally at <HI>Narragan&s;et,</HI> wrote to Mr. <HI>Prince</HI> who was then Governour of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> that <HI>Alexander</HI> was contri|ving mi&s;chief again&s;t the Engli&s;h, and that he had &s;ollicited the <HI>Nar|ragangan&s;ets</HI> to ingage with him in his de&s;igned rebellion. Hereupon, Capt. <HI>Willet</HI> (who lived near to <HI>Mount-Hope,</HI> the place where <HI>Alex|ander</HI> did re&s;ide) was appointed to &s;peak with him, and to de&s;ire him to attend the next Court in <HI>Plymouth,</HI> for their &s;atisfaction, and his own

But when the day for his appearance was come, in&s;tead of that, he at that very time went over to the <HI>Narragan&s;ets</HI> his pretended enemies, which compared with other Circum&s;tances, cau&s;ed the Gentlemen at <HI>Plymouth</HI> to &s;u&s;pect there was more of Truth in the Information given, than at fir&s;t they were aware of. Wherefore the Governour and Magi&s;trates there, ordered Major <HI>Win&s;l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">w</HI> (who is &s;ince and at this day the Governour of that Colony) to take a party of men, and fetch down <HI>Alexander.</HI> The Major con&s;idering that <HI>&s;emper no cuit differre paratis,</HI> he took but ten armed men with him from <HI>Mar&s;hfield,</HI> intending to have taken more at the Towns that lay nearer <HI>Mount-Hope.</HI> But divine providence &s;o ordered, as that when they were about the midway between <HI>Plymouth</HI> and <HI>Bri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">gwater,</HI> ob&s;erving an hunting hou&s;e, they rode up to it, and there did they find <HI>Alexander</HI> and many of his men well armed, but their Guns &s;tanding together without the hou&s;e, the Major with his &s;mall party, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of the Indians Arms, and be&s;et the hou&s;e; then did he go in among&s;t them, acquainting the <HI>Sachim</HI> with the rea|&s;on of his coming in &s;uch a way, de&s;iring <HI>Alexander</HI> with his Interpre|ter to walk out with him, who did &s;o a little di&s;tance from the hou&s;e, and then under&s;tood what Commi&s;&s;ion the <HI>Major</HI> had received con|cerning him. The proud <HI>Sachim</HI> fell into a raging pa&s;&s;ion at this &s;ur|pri&s;e, &s;aying that the Governour had no rea&s;on to credit Rumors, or to &s;end for him in &s;uch a way nor would he go to <HI>Plymouth</HI> but when he &s;aw cau&s;e. It was replyed to him, that his breach of word touching ap|pearance at <HI>Plymouth</HI> Court, and in&s;tead thereof going at the &s;ame time to his pretended enemies, augmented jealou&s;ies concerning him. In fine the <HI>Major</HI> told him, that his order was to bring him to <HI>Plimouth,</HI> and that (by the help of God) he would do it, or el&s;e he would dy on the place; Al&s;o declaring to him that if he would &s;ubmit, he might ex|pect re&s;pective u&s;age, but if he once more denyed to go, he &s;hould ne|ver &s;tir from the ground whereon he &s;tood, and with a Pi&s;tol at the <HI>Sa|chims</HI> brea&s;t, required that his next words &s;hould be a po&s;itive and clear An&s;wer to what was demanded. Hereupon his Interpreter (a di&s;creet Indian, brother to <HI>John Sau&s;aman</HI>) being &s;en&s;ible of <HI>Alexanders</HI> pa&s;&s;ionate di&s;po&s;ition, entreated that he might &s;peak a few words to the <HI>Sachim,</HI> before he gave his An&s;wer. The prudent di&s;cour&s;e of this Indian pre|vailed &s;o far as that <HI>Alexander</HI> yielded to go, only reque&s;ting that he might go like a <HI>Sachim,</HI> with his men attending him, which (although
<PB N="72" REF="40"> there was &s;ome hazard in it, they being many, and the Engli&s;h but a few) was granted to him. The weather being hot, the Major offered him an hor&s;e to ride on, but his &s;quaw and diver&s;e Indian women be|ing in company, he refu&s;ed, &s;aying he could go on foot as well as they, entreating only that there might be a complying with their pace, which was done, and re&s;ting &s;everal times by the way, <HI>Alexander</HI> and his Indi|ans were refre&s;hed by the Engli&s;h; no other di&s;cour&s;e hapning while they were upon their march, but what was plea&s;ant and amicable.

Accor|dingly he and his Train were courteou&s;ly entertained by the Major. And albeit not &s;o much as an angry word pa&s;&s;ed between them whil&s;t at <HI>Mar&s;hfield,</HI> yet proud <HI>Alexander</HI> vexing and fretting in his &s;pirit, that &s;uch a check was given him, he &s;udeenly fell &s;ick of a fever.

Mr. <HI>Fuller</HI> (the Phy&s;itian) coming providentially thither at that time, the Sachim and his men earne&s;tly de&s;ired that he would admini&s;ter to him, which he was unwilling to doe, but by their importunity was prevailed with to doe the be&s;t he could to help him, and therefore gave him a potion of wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ing Phy&s;ick, which the Indians thought did him good; but his di&s;temper afterward prevailing, they entreated to di&s;mi&s;s him, in order to a return home, which upon engagement of appearance at the next Court was granted to him, &s;oon after his being returned home, he dyed.</P>

This Covenant he perfidiou&s;ly brake: For in Anno 1671. it was evident that he with other his Confederates had been con&s;piring again&s;t the Colony, under who&s;e protection and Jurisdicti|on he had &s;ubmitted him&s;elf. He then armed him&s;elf and acted like a Rebel that intended a &s;peedy ri&s;ing, yea he ordered (as &s;ome Indians

The con|clu&s;ion was, <HI>Philip</HI> acknowledged his offence, and was appointed to give a &s;um of mony to defray the charges which his In&s;olent Clamours had put that Colony unto. The particulars which <HI>Philip</HI> then con&s;ent|ed to were the&s;e.</P>

<P N="2">2. He engaged to pay the Colony an hundred pound towards repa|ration of &s;uch wrong as they had &s;u&s;teined by his misdemeanors.</P>
<P N="3">3. He was under obligation to &s;end five wolves heads every year to the Governour of <HI>Plymouth</HI> in Token of his fealty.</P>

<P N="5">5. In ca&s;e any future difference &s;hould ari&s;e between him and the Engli&s;h, he would repair to the Government there to rectify matters, before ingaging in any ho&s;tile attempts.</P>
<PB N="74" REF="41">
<P N="6">6. That he would not di&s;po&s;e of any of his Lands but with the appro|bation of the Engli&s;h government there. So was he dismi&s;&s;ed. Some of the&s;e Covenants were in part ob&s;erved by him, and &s;ome particulars not at all&mdash;Thus did things re&s;t between the Engli&s;h and him, until the year 1674. when in <HI>January</HI> an Indian Preacher, known by the name of <HI>John Sau&s;aman,</HI> addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the pre&s;ent Governour of <HI>Pli|mouth,</HI> informing him that the Indians were complotting the de|&s;truction of the Engli&s;h, and that not only the <HI>Wompanoags,</HI> but the <HI>Narragan&s;ets,</HI> yea and the <HI>Mohegins</HI> were involving them&s;elves in this Con&s;piracy. This <HI>Sau&s;aman</HI> was by birth a <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et,</HI> his Father and Mother living in <HI>Dorche&s;ter,</HI> and they both died Chri&s;tians: This their Son did for &s;ome time apo&s;tatize from his Chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion, and lived like an Heathen, being Philips Secretary (for he could write a ve|ry legible hand) and one of his Coun&s;ellors, untill at la&s;t God convinced him of his mi&s;ery, and he manife&s;ted &s;uch evident &s;igns of repentance as that he was, after his return from pagan <HI>Philip,</HI> reconciled to the praying Indians and bapti&s;ed, and received as a member in one of the Indian Churches, yea and imployed as an In&s;tructor among&s;t them every Lords Day. Neverthele&s;s, his information (becau&s;e it had an In|dian original, and one can hardly believe them when they &s;peak truth) was not at fir&s;t much regarded, untill by relation of Circum&s;tances, he made it too apparent, that <HI>Philip</HI> was really hatching mi&s;chief. The effect was, the Governour of <HI>Plymouth</HI> advi&s;ing with his Councill, re&s;ol|ved once more to &s;end for <HI>Philip,</HI> and to enquire into the truth of things: But before that could be accompli&s;hed, an Indian called <HI>Tobi|as,</HI> with his Son, and another Indian named <HI>Matta&s;hinnamy,</HI> meeting with <HI>John Sau&s;aman</HI> at a pond, cruelly murthered him; and that their villany might not be di&s;covered, they cut an hole through the Ice, and put in the dead murthered Body, leaving his hat and Gun upon the Ice, that &s;o others might think that he had drowned him&s;elf. It be|ing rumor'd that <HI>Sau&s;aman</HI> was lo&s;t, the dead body was &s;ought after, and found in the pond, and taken up and buried.</P>
<P>Jealou&s;ies being on the &s;pirits of men that the other Indians had murthered him, on the account of revealing their Con&s;piracyes to the Engli&s;h: The Governour of <HI>Plymouth</HI> ordered the Con&s;table of <HI>Mid|dlebury</HI> (that being the neare&s;t town to the Place where the murther was committed) to cau&s;e <HI>John Sau&s;amans</HI> body to be taken up again, and to empanel a Jury as a <HI>Coroners Inque&s;t,</HI> to make enquiry how he came by his death: And they found that he had been murthered, for his neck was broken by twi&s;ting of his head round; which is the
<PB N="75" REF="41"> way that the Indians &s;ome times u&s;e when they practice murthers; al&s;o, his head was extreamly &s;wollen, and his Body was wounded in &s;everal parts of it, and when it was fir&s;t taken out of the pond, no water i&s;&s;ued out of it, which argued that the Body was not drowned, but dead be|fore it came into the water.</P>
<P>Moreover, when <HI>Tobias</HI> (the &s;u&s;pected Murtherer) came near the dead body, it fell a bleeding on fre&s;h as if it had been newly &s;lain-albeit it was buried a con&s;iderable time before that.</P>
<P>Afterward an Indian called <HI>Patuckson,</HI> came and te&s;tified to their fa|ces that he &s;aw <HI>Tobias</HI> and the other Indians murthering <HI>Sau&s;aman:</HI> He al&s;o him&s;elf before his death had declared, that he was afraid tho&s;e very Indians would at la&s;t prove his Murtherers.</P>
<P>They were therefore apprehended &amp; kept in Durance untill Plymouth Court, which was held in June, 1675. and being found guilty of <HI>Sau|&s;aman</HI>'s Death, they were (one of them before his execution confe&s;&s;ing the murther) condemned and executed. And then did <HI>Philip,</HI> being (as was verily &s;uppo&s;ed) privy to what <HI>Tobias</HI> (his Coun&s;ellor) and tho&s;e w th him had perpetrated upon <HI>John Sau&s;aman,</HI> fall to open Rebellion and blood&s;hedding among&s;t the Engli&s;h at <HI>Swanzy,</HI> who were his next Neighbours.</P>
<P>But of the &s;pecial Occurrences attending the late (and not yet ended) <HI>War</HI> between the Engli&s;h and the Indians, I have el&s;ewhore given a brief account, and therefore &s;hall not here add any thing, that not compor|ting with my pre&s;ent de&s;ign.</P>
<P>The Particulars which have been mentioned, are the chief (if not the only) Troubles which have hapned by the Indians in <HI>New-England,</HI> from the fir&s;t planting thereof by the Engli&s;h till the late Commoti|ons. Some few private Murthers there have been, which are not in&s;i|&s;ted on in this <HI>Narrative,</HI> as namely tho&s;e at <HI>Nantucket,</HI> and that by <HI>Matoonas</HI> his Son, and that at <HI>Woburn,</HI> but the publick peace was not &s;o endangered by tho&s;e clande&s;tine Revenges, as by the Con&s;piracyes, the <HI>Relation</HI> whereof hath been de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y to ob&s;erve; from the <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> of the&s;e <HI>Troubles,</HI> that whereas there have been two &s;orts of men de&s;igning &s;ettlement in this part of <HI>America,</HI> &s;ome that came hither on the account of Trade, and world|ly Intere&s;ts, by whom the Indians have been &s;candalized, others that came hither on a Religious and con&s;cientious account, having in their Eye, the Conver&s;ion of the <HI>Heathen</HI> unto Chri&s;t; the former have
<PB REF="42"> been attended with bla&s;ting ruining providences, the&s;e latter have bee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ignally owned by the Lord Je&s;us; for the like hath been rarely known in the world, that a plantation &s;hould be rai&s;ed out of nothing, and brought to &s;uch con&s;iderablene&s;s in &s;o &s;hort a time, whereas in the clo&s;e of the la&s;t <HI>Century,</HI> there was not &s;o much as one Chri&s;tian in this Land, there are now above <HI>Four&s;core</HI> Engli&s;h, and <HI>Six</HI> Indian <HI>Churches</HI> therein, be&s;ides many other Congregations calling upon the Name of the True God in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, although as yet not brought into Church e&s;tate, according to the order of the Go&s;pel.</P>
