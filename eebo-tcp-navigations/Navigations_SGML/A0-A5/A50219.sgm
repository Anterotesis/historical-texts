<HEAD>New-England VINDICATED, From the <HI>&V;nju&s;t A&s;per&s;ions</HI> ca&s;t on the former <HI>Government</HI> there, by &s;ome late <HI>CONSIDERATIONS,</HI> Pretending to Shew, <HI>That the</HI> Charters <HI>in tho&s;e Colonies were Taken from them on Account of their De&s;troying the</HI> Manufactures <HI>and</HI> Navigation <HI>of</HI> England.</HEAD>
<P>WE &s;hall pretermit what the <HI>Con&s;iderators</HI> have in their <HI>Scandalous Libel</HI> related concerning other Plantations, and only take notice of what concerns <HI>New-England.</HI> And in the fir&s;t place they affirm,</P>
<P><HI>That hundreds of Ships have been Employed to tran&s;port thence Tobacco, Sugars, Wooll and other Materials for Manufactures, into</HI> France, Holland; <HI>and to import thence into</HI> New-England, <HI>Lin|nen, Woollen and all other Manufactures.</HI></P>
<P>This at fir&s;t View will appear a great Untruth to all that know <HI>New-England;</HI> for that Countrey can hardly expend the Goods that are yearly Exported from hence thither, the Num|ber of the People con&s;idered; nor have they any other way to vend &s;o great a quantity of Goods as &s;uch a Number of Ships mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily Import: Nor have they Commodities
<PB REF="2" MS="y">
<PB N="1" REF="2" MS="y">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="2" REF="3">to Export fit for tho&s;e parts, nor could they (all things con|&s;idered) purcha&s;e Goods thence on &s;o ea&s;ie terms as they may have them from <HI>England.</HI> And they have made a <HI>Law again&s;t Exporting of Wooll,</HI> not having a twentieth part of what is nece&s;&s;ary for their own U&s;e. The mo&s;t of their Shipping is employed in tran&s;porting Lumber, Hor&s;es and Provi&s;ions to <HI>Jamaica, Barbados,</HI> and the <HI>Caribbee I&s;lands,</HI> without which tho&s;e I&s;lands cannot well &s;ub&s;i&s;t: And many Ve&s;&s;els are built there upon Account of Merchants in <HI>London,</HI> &s;ent home, and by them often &s;old or employed here: And to prevent Illegal practi|ces, they made in the Year 1663. a Law, That <HI>the Act of Na|vigation</HI> &s;hould be &s;trictly ob&s;erved; and their Governours have been carefull to &s;ee it Executed, and are yearly Sworn &s;o to doe; nor can it be proved, that the lea&s;t Breach of it was ever allowed by the Government, which is not to be bla|med for the private Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of &s;ome few particular per|&s;ons.</P>
<P>As for what the <HI>Con&s;iderators</HI> report, concerning the Manner of Vacating the Charter of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets</HI> Colony, the Mat|ter is by them fallaciou&s;ly repre&s;ented. When a <HI>Quo War|ranto</HI> was in the Year 1683. i&s;&s;ued out again&s;t them, with the Notification thereof: By the then Kings Order were &s;ent over one hundred Copies of the proceedings again&s;t the Charter of <HI>London,</HI> and two hundred Copies of a Declaration, to be di&s;per&s;ed among the People in <HI>New-England,</HI> di&s;charging the Inhabitants from all Rates and Contributions towards the Ex|pence of the &s;aid Suit, and enjoyning tho&s;e particular Per|&s;ons mentioned in the <HI>Quo Warranto,</HI> to make their Defence at their own particular Charge, without any help by a publick Stock.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s the Governour and Company appointed an Attorney to An&s;wer to the <HI>Quo Warranto</HI> in the Court of <HI>Kings Bench;</HI> where it was let fall, and a new Suit Began by <HI>Scire Facias</HI> in Court of <HI>Chancery,</HI> and Judgment entred again&s;t them for Default in not Appearing: Whereas, con&s;idering the Remotene&s;s of <HI>New-England</HI> from <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> it was im|po&s;&s;ible for them to Appear in the time allowed, and &s;o by a Surprize their Charter was taken from them.</P>
<P>As to what is objected about <HI>Coyning,</HI> many Gold&s;miths in
<PB N="3" REF="3"><HI>London</HI> can te&s;tifie, that the Money coyned in <HI>New-England</HI> is as good as that of <HI>England,</HI> and not of a <HI>ba&s;er Allay,</HI> (as is &s;ugge&s;ted.) It was formerly cu&s;tomary for private Per&s;ons in <HI>England</HI> to Coyn Farthings for their own U&s;e, and the Coyning in <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets</HI> Colony was little more than that, and with De&s;ign to prevent the great Injuries Merchants and others &s;u&s;tained by ba&s;e <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Money: And the Mint was &s;et up in 1652. when there was no King in <HI>England,</HI> but the Go|vernment out of Cour&s;e; and when the ancient Government of <HI>England</HI> was re&s;ettled, and the Kings mind to the contra|ry &s;ignified to them, they re&s;olved to comply therewith, though many wayes di&s;advantageous to them&s;elves. Was not the Value of Coyn altered in <HI>Pen&s;ilvania?</HI> Did not the Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI> in <HI>Maryland,</HI> Coyn Money with his own Image on one &s;ide, and his Coat of Arms on the other? Did not the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company? But when they under&s;tood ther Error, they petitioned the King for liberty of Coynage, and pardon of what was pa&s;t, and it was granted them? Why then &s;hould <HI>New-England</HI> be e&s;teemed more criminal than other Planta|tions?</P>
<P>The <HI>Con&s;iderators</HI> go on, and complain, That in <HI>New-Eng|land</HI> they have <HI>Impo&s;ed Taxes upon Shipping and the Manufactures of</HI> England <HI>coming into tho&s;e parts.</HI> There hath been <HI>none</HI> Im|po&s;ed on Shipping but <HI>Powder-Money,</HI> and not half &s;o much as is done in the other Plantations, nor any upon the Manu|factures of <HI>England</HI> particularly, but only one penny upon Twenty &s;hillings Value of all Merchandizes what&s;oever, as on all other E&s;tates in the Countrey; and &s;ince Charters were taken from them, the &s;ame and more hath been levied by the pre&s;ent Governour, be&s;ides &s;ix times the Fees upon Shipping more than was paid formerly: All which hath been done by him without any con&s;ent of the People, or their Repre&s;en|tatives, which the former Government never practi&s;ed.</P>
<P>Whereas it is maliciou&s;ly in&s;inuated, That the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets</HI> have Impo&s;ed an Oath of Fidelity to their Common-wealth, we &s;hall only in An&s;wer In&s;ert the Copy of the Oath, as it is in their printed Law-book.</P>

<P><HI>WHereas I</HI> [A. B.] <HI>am an Inhabitant within this Juris|diction, con&s;idering how I &s;tand Obliged to the Kings Ma|je&s;ty, his Heirs and Succe&s;&s;ors, by our Charter and the Government E&s;tabli&s;hed thereby: Do Swear accordingly by the great and dread|ful Name of the Ever-living God, that I will bear Faith and true Allegiance to our Sovereign Lord the King, his Heirs and Succe&s;|&s;ors; and that I will be True and Faithfull to this Government, and accordingly yield A&s;&s;i&s;tance thereunto, with my Per&s;on and E&s;tate, as in Equity I am bound.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And will al&s;o truly endeavour to Maintain and Pre&s;erve all the Liberties and Priviledges thereof, Submitting my &s;elf unto the whol|&s;om Laws made and e&s;tabli&s;hed by the &s;ame.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And farther, That I will not Plot or Practi&s;e any evil again&s;t it, or con&s;ent to any that &s;hall &s;o do; but will timely di&s;cover and reveal the &s;ame to Lawful Authority now here E&s;tabli&s;hed, for the &s;peedy preventing thereof. So help me God in our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
</FLOATEXT>
<P>Nor know we that they have (as is a&s;&s;erted) <HI>Encroached upon their Neighbouring Colonies in a ho&s;tile manner,</HI> except it be meant of their A&s;&s;i&s;ting with Voluntiers when King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second &s;ent to take <HI>Monhatas,</HI> now called <HI>New-York;</HI> or of their Concurrence in taking from the <HI>French,</HI> S. <HI>Johns, Pe|nob&s;cot, Port Royal,</HI> which were put into the hands of tho&s;e that were then in Power in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Nor have they (as is alledged) <HI>Affronted the Commi&s;&s;ioners of King</HI> Charles <HI>the Second;</HI> who&s;e Commi&s;&s;ion (as to the legal part of it, not by them duly ob&s;erved) was in &s;ome particu|lars Illegal and Arbitrary, and Empowred them to <HI>Hear and determine all Cau&s;es</HI> (not by Law, but) <HI>according to their &s;ound Di&s;cretion;</HI> which could not be &s;ubmitted to by the <HI>Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;ets,</HI> without giving up at once their Charter and Privi|ledges.</P>
<P>Neither have they <HI>made Laws again&s;t all Opinions in Religion, excepting tho&s;e of the Congregational Churches, and more e&s;pecially again&s;t the Church of</HI> England. It mu&s;t be acknowledged, that there have been &s;ome &s;evere and unju&s;tifiable Laws there, in
<PB REF="4">matters <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 span"> long &s;ince &s;en&s;ible; yet what is here affirmed, is untrue; for <HI>Presbyterians</HI> have equal Encouragement with tho&s;e of the <HI>Con|gregational per&s;wa&s;ion:</HI> Nor are there any <HI>Laws again&s;t the Church of</HI> England, as is fal&s;ly and malitiou&s;ly pretended. Let them prove if they can, that any number of Men inclined to wor&s;hip God, in the way of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> were denyed by the Government in <HI>New-England</HI> liberty &s;o to do. The Magi|&s;trates there have often profe&s;&s;ed, that they would not hinder any that were &s;o principled from practi&s;ing what they did mo&s;t approve of.</P>
<P>As for their <HI>Treating ill the Captains of the Kings Ships for de|&s;iring Permi&s;&s;ion to recruit them&s;elves with Men and Victuals; and as to entertaining of Pirats:</HI> The&s;e things are like the former. If any Commanders of Ships have behaved them&s;elves In&s;olently, and violated the Laws of God and the Land, it became the Government to te&s;tifie again&s;t them; but malice it &s;elf cannot deny, that the People of <HI>New-England</HI> have been extreamly Ci|vil to Strangers, and e&s;pecially to &s;uch as the King hath put any mark of Honour upon; and they have &s;ometimes relieved, and that <HI>Gratis,</HI> the Kings Ships di&s;tre&s;&s;ed through want of Provi&s;ion: And if any <HI>Pirats</HI> have been entertained, it hath been becau&s;e they were not known to be &s;uch; for they made a particular Law again&s;t Piracy, agreeable to the Law of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> on account whereof &s;ome have been there Executed.</P>
<P>The <HI>Con&s;iderators</HI> tell us, that the People of <HI>New-England</HI> are <HI>free from all Taxes, and Contribute nothing to the Crown, nor their own Protection or Support:</HI> Whereas they are no more free than other Plantations, for they pay Cu&s;toms in the Plantations for the Goods they fetch thence into <HI>New-England;</HI> and when tho&s;e Goods are brought into <HI>England,</HI> they pay the &s;ame a &s;econd time; &s;o that they Contribute not a little to the Crown. Before the change of their Government, they never did put the Crown to a penny Charge for their Protection or Support: but &s;ince that, have been very chargeable, and le&s;s beneficial to the Crown.</P>
<P>It is &s;trange, that the Con&s;iderators &s;hould have the Impu|dence to publi&s;h to the World, <HI>That the People of New-England in General, are better &s;atisfied with the pre&s;ent Government there, and do not</HI>
<GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="1+ pages">
<PB REF="5">among whom there is not one known Papi&s;t, excepting &s;ome now in Government there.</P>
<P>All the Charters of <HI>New-England,</HI> one only excepted, are &s;till in force; there having been no Judgment again&s;t them, nor Surrender of them made or Recorded; and by their Char|ters they have Power to choo&s;e their own Governours and Ma|gi&s;trates, as much as any Towns Corporate, or Cities here in <HI>England,</HI> have Power to choo&s;e their own Maior and Al|dermen. Be&s;ides, mu&s;t tho&s;e Colonies in <HI>New-England,</HI> be the only ones excepted from Indempnity, and all other Corpora|tions &s;uppo&s;ed to have been without fault? And mu&s;t they alone remain &s;orrowful for the lo&s;s of what is &s;o valuable to them? who at their own va&s;t Charges, and great Hazards &s;ub|dued a Wilderne&s;s, and with the lo&s;s of many hundreds of their Lives, have maintained and defended it, to the enlargment of the Kings Dominions; hoping, as in Rea&s;on they might, that their Po&s;terity &s;hould enjoy the benefit thereof? So that to deprive them of their Charters, is to deal more hardly, than to do the like with any Bodies Politick in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>As to the other Pamphlet newly come forth, called, <HI>An Ab&s;tract of Laws in</HI> New-England, <HI>not agreeable with the Laws of</HI> England: The fir&s;t Law they take notice of, is a Fiction of their own, the re&s;t were mo&s;t of them long &s;ince repealed; yea, all that were inconvenient, or e&s;teemed repugnant to the Laws of <HI>England;</HI> and the <HI>Con&s;iderators</HI> (whom we mu&s;t needs &s;uppo&s;e to be the Au|thors of the Ab&s;tract) if ever they read the <HI>New-England</HI> Laws, could not be ignorant that the Word <HI>Common-wealth,</HI> &s;o much complain'd of, was repealed and obliterated, and the Word <HI>Juri&s;diction</HI> in&s;erted in&s;tead of it.</P>
<P>As for the Remarks which they make thereon, they are no|thing el&s;e but the Ebullitions of a &s;piteful Spirit, and &s;o noto|riou&s;ly fal&s;e, as that we think it not worth the while to recite, much le&s;s to refute them.</P>
