<P>IT's not intended, by Publi&s;hing the Truth contained in the&s;e following Sheets, thereby to di&s;parage any other <HI>Colony</HI> already Settled, or to be Settled in tho&s;e Parts of <HI>America;</HI> but to contradict the Di&s;|ingenuous, and Fal&s;e Reports of &s;ome Men, who have made it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;peak unju&s;tly of <HI>New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> and Our Proceedings therein: As though the Methods of Settlement were Confu&s;ed and &V;ncertain, no Man knowing his Own Land, and &s;everal &s;uch idle Lying Stories. Therefore, to &s;atisfye the Rea&s;onable and &V;nprejudi|ced, who de&s;ire to be rightly inform'd, the Manner or Method of Our Settlements are thus: The Country from the Mouth (that is, from the Sea) to the Head of <HI>Delaware-River,</HI> is about <HI>Two Hun|dred</HI> and <HI>Fifty</HI> Miles in Length, and is divided into <HI>One Hundred</HI> Shares, or <HI>Proprieties;</HI> as may be &s;een by the Deeds made to every <HI>Purcha&s;er</HI> thereof; every <HI>Proprietor</HI> naturally having a Con&s;iderable Quantity of his Land lying by the <HI>River</HI>-&s;ide: I &s;ay, every <HI>Proprie|tor</HI> having a great Part of his Propriety contigious to that Noble and Navigable <HI>River</HI> of <HI>Delaware,</HI> is an Accomodation of no &s;mall Va|lue.</P>
<P>Then, as to the <HI>Government;</HI> one out of each of the&s;e <HI>Hundred Proprieties,</HI> is to be freely cho&s;en by the Inhabitants thereof, to meet and &s;it as a General-A&s;&s;embly, to make and alter Laws, to hear and redre&s;s all manner of Grievances what&s;oever: And not any, the lea&s;t Tax, either in Money or Goods, or any other Services, upon any Pretence what&s;oever, to be impo&s;ed on the People, but by the Con&s;ent of the&s;e their Repre&s;entatives in the General-A&s;&s;embly: And this A&s;&s;embly is to meet Annually upon a Day certain, as is Irrevocably ordained in one of the Chapters of Our <HI>General Conce&s;&s;ions,</HI> as a Fundamen|<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters">, never to Alter or Change.</P>
<P><PB REF="3">The Number of Aeres in one of the&s;e <HI>Proprieties,</HI> is about <HI>Twen|ty Thou&s;and;</HI> though &s;ome (and tho&s;e no ordinary Surveyors nei|ther) have judged it to be almo&s;t as much more: But whether the Number be more or le&s;s, I &s;hall not exactly affirm; But this I may a&s;&s;ert, (and it ought to be con&s;idered by every Con&s;idering <HI>Purcha&s;er)</HI> That a large Share of their Land being certain to lye upon &s;o Brave and Navigable a <HI>River</HI> as <HI>Delaware</HI> is known to be, is in it &s;elf very Con&s;iderable, and may be va&s;tly Advantagious to &s;uch <HI>Purcha|&s;ers,</HI> who at pre&s;ent, do, or hereafter &s;hall Incline to Trade. And upon which <HI>River</HI> are &s;everal Good Towns and Settlements already, (viz.) <HI>Burlington, Northampton, Monmouth, Wellingbrough, Mansfield, Springton, Nottingham, Salem,</HI> and Others: In &s;ome whereof, are Con&s;iderable Manufacturies and Trade E&s;tabli&s;hed and E&s;tabli&s;hing: So that, <HI>New-Jer&s;ey</HI> in Reality is another thing, than what it was within the&s;e Seven Years, before it was Peopled and Set|tled in that Order and Freedom as now it is; as &s;ome of the&s;e follow|ing <HI>LETTERS</HI> (according to Rea&s;on) do te&s;tify, That tho&s;e that go to <HI>New-Jer&s;ey</HI> now, need not undergoe any of the Difficulties that They did, who went over at fir&s;t, when they had neither Hou&s;e nor Corn of their Own: But now they have Good of Both, and not only &s;ufficient for Them&s;elves, but con&s;iderably to &s;pare, for the Ac|commodating of &s;uch that &s;hall come to Inhabit among them, until they can provide of Their Own.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAving from the Di&s;cour&s;e we had formerly, about the <HI>South-We&s;t-Part</HI> of <HI>New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> lying upon the <HI>Bay</HI> and <HI>River</HI> of <HI>Delaware,</HI> perceived a great De|&s;ire in you, to be particularly informed thereof, from the Ob&s;ervations I had either made My Self, in my &s;everal Voyages into tho&s;e Parts, or from the Collections I took from the <HI>Engli&s;h, Swedes,</HI> or <HI>Hollanders</HI>; and perceiving &s;everal of your Ingenious, Publick-&s;pirited <HI>Friends</HI> were ingaged therein with <HI>Your Self,</HI> and that it was to be looked upon no longer for your own particular Curio&s;ity, but as a Natio|nal Concern, from the Thriving Genius of &s;uch Worthy Underta|kers: Which, together with the Kindne&s;s I bear to Your Self, and the Per&s;on that made our Acquaintance, obliged Me, as &s;oon as I could, to comply with your Commands.</P>
<P>Then be plea&s;ed to know, that the Lord <HI>Delaware,</HI> Governor of <HI>Virginia, Anno</HI> 1611. during his Stay in tho&s;e Parts, &s;pent one whole <HI>Summer</HI> in making a particular Search of all that Part of <HI>America</HI>; lying, and being Situate betwixt <HI>Cape-Augu&s;tine</HI> on the <HI>South-We&s;t,</HI> to <HI>Cape-Porpus</HI> on the <HI>North-Ea&s;t,</HI> which is from 28. to 44. Degrees of <HI>North-Latitude,</HI> and 430. Leagues by that Shoar; and having vi&s;ited and viewed all the Remarkable <HI>Bays</HI> and <HI>Rivers,</HI> as al&s;o, particularly In&s;pected the <HI>Clime</HI> and <HI>Soyl</HI> of all tho&s;e Parts, pitched upon this Place, which is now called
<PB N="6" REF="4">
<HI>New-Jer&s;ey</HI>; which <HI>River</HI> the Lord <HI>Delaware</HI> called after his own Name, and by which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have known it ever &s;ince. And it is not to be que&s;tioned, had not Death prevented his Purpo&s;es, but that he had prevailed with the then <HI>Lords-Commi&s;&s;ioners,</HI> (cal|led the <HI>Virginia-Company</HI>) to have removed that <HI>Colony</HI> to this Place: Which, without doubt, had prevented the Death of very many Thou&s;ands of the <HI>Engli&s;h Nation</HI>; who have, &s;ince that time, found their Graves in <HI>Virginia,</HI> by rea&s;on of the many <HI>Boggs, Swamps,</HI> and <HI>Standing-Waters,</HI> which corrupt the Air of the <HI>Coun|try.</HI> And to &s;hew you, that the Lord <HI>Delaware</HI> was not &s;ingular in this Point, &s;ee the Character given of it by <HI>Jeronama Beeckman</HI> of <HI>Stetin,</HI> in a <HI>Tract</HI> of his Printed <HI>Anno</HI> 1636. This <HI>Beeckman</HI> was &s;ent thither with a Great <HI>Cargoe</HI> from <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> by <HI>John Lu&s;&s;ingen,</HI> and <HI>Peter Coyman,</HI> Eminent Merchants of that City; who tru&s;ted him with all their Concern, Laden on Two Ships, the <HI>Orania,</HI> and the <HI>Ickeabome</HI>; who Return'd in about <HI>Fourteen</HI> Months, bringing them Back in all &s;orts of <HI>Furs, Skins,</HI> and <HI>Poltry,</HI> clear Profit <HI>One Hundred</HI> and <HI>Thirty</HI> Pounds, <HI>per Cent.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> Thus much in General; but to come to Particulars:</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> This <HI>Province</HI> (I mean the <HI>South-We&s;t-Part</HI> of it, borde|ring upon the <HI>River</HI> of <HI>Delaware</HI>) is Situate parallel to the mo&s;t Happy of the <HI>East</HI> and <HI>We&s;tern</HI> Parts of the World; and is na|turally &s;tored with all Sorts of Timber, and other Materials for the Building and Equipping of Ships, Structure of Hou&s;es, making of Cabinets, and all other Curious Joyner's Work.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> There is <HI>Sumach,</HI> and &s;everal other Drugs for the U&s;e of <HI>Dyers</HI>; be&s;ides, &s;ome Trees there are, that produce both <HI>Gums,</HI> and <HI>Medicinal Oyls,</HI> as is ob&s;erved by Doctor <HI>Adrian Vander-dunke,</HI> who &s;earched that <HI>Country</HI> at his own proper Charge.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That there is all Sorts of <HI>Engli&s;h-Corn,</HI> and may be Two Harve&s;ts of &s;everal Sorts of <HI>Grain,</HI> in one Year: As al&s;o, that a Poor Man by his Rea&s;onable Labour, can in the &s;ame Space of Time make <HI>Fifteen Thou&s;and</HI> Pipe-Staves, which are worth on the Place <HI>Sixty</HI> Pounds; but at the <HI>Canaries, Three Hundred</HI> Pounds; which, according to an ordinary Calculation, is but Three Weeks Sail, and the Tran&s;portation is accounted but half at mo&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> That in this <HI>Province</HI> there is not only as good <HI>Iron-Mines</HI> as are in any Parts of the World; but al&s;o, great Con|veniency from the Multitude of <HI>Brooks</HI> for <HI>Iron-Mills</HI>; which in the making thereof, would al&s;o clear the Ground of <HI>Wood,</HI> and fit it for Planting.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="4"><HI>Fifthly,</HI> That <HI>Vines</HI> grow naturally all over this <HI>Province</HI>; of which, Wild as they are, <HI>Wines,</HI> and very Good <HI>Brandy</HI> have been made: And, I am well a&s;&s;ured, if tho&s;e <HI>Vines</HI> were Tran&s;planted and Cul|tivated accordingly, there might be Rich and Generous <HI>Wines</HI> made in the <HI>We&s;t-Part</HI> of <HI>New-Jer&s;ey:</HI> But if <HI>Vine-Stocks</HI> of the <HI>Greek, Calabrian,</HI> and <HI>Cyprian,</HI> with the <HI>Candian-Grapes,</HI> were Tran&s;plan|ted into this <HI>Province,</HI> (tho&s;e <HI>Countries</HI> where the&s;e <HI>Grapes</HI> are in Perfection, lying parallel to This) there would certainly be a Sta|ple, which may enrich both <HI>England,</HI> and all tho&s;e Countries, to the Envy of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> That the Art, U&s;e, and Excellency of the <HI>Silk-Worm</HI> might be had in this <HI>Province,</HI> with great Conveniency; the <HI>Mul|berry-Trees</HI> growing there Wild, very numerous, and the Leaves to be had for gathering; whereas the <HI>French</HI> Nobility and Gentry make a Great Revenue of <HI>Mulberry-Trees</HI>; be&s;ides their Fruits, the Leaves of every Tree being Farmed in <HI>Languedoc</HI> and <HI>Provence,</HI> as in Goodne&s;s, from <HI>Five</HI> Shillings to <HI>Twenty</HI> Shillings, and up|wards, <HI>per Annum.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Tu&s;cany</HI> rai&s;ed <HI>Anno</HI> 1671. <HI>Six|ty Thou&s;and</HI> Ducats on the Leaves of <HI>Mulberry-Trees</HI> alone, as he doth Yearly about the &s;ame Sum.</P>
<P><HI>Mon&s;ieur Le Telliere,</HI> Great Uncle to the <HI>Marque&s;s</HI> of <HI>Lovoy,</HI> Se|cretary of State to the pre&s;ent <HI>French King,</HI> writ Ob&s;ervations on this Subject, <HI>Anno</HI> 1636. affirming, That <HI>Silk-Worms</HI> were Tran|&s;ported out of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> into <HI>Italy,</HI> in the Year 1540. and that they had not been in <HI>Languedoc</HI> and <HI>Provence</HI> in <HI>France</HI> above <HI>Sixty</HI> Years; &amp; yet the Revenue of <HI>Silk</HI> in tho&s;e <HI>Provinces,</HI> was more worth both to the <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Nobility,</HI> than the Product of <HI>Wine, Oyl, Woad,</HI> and all other Fruits what&s;oever.</P>
<P><HI>Mon&s;ieur Agume,</HI> in his Ob&s;ervations on that Subject Printed at <HI>Lyons, Anno</HI> 1654. &s;ayes, That in <HI>Forty</HI> Years, the making of <HI>Silk</HI> in the <HI>South</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> had brought into the <HI>Exchecquer</HI> or <HI>Financy</HI> of that <HI>Crown, Fifty Seven</HI> Millions of <HI>Livers,</HI> which is about <HI>One Hundred</HI> and <HI>Twenty Thou&s;and</HI> Pounds, <HI>per Annum,</HI> Cu&s;tom for the Raw <HI>Silk</HI> only. It is admirable to behold, how the&s;e <HI>Silk-Worms</HI> &s;tore up the Di&s;po&s;ing-Matter, from whence the <HI>Silk</HI> comes; the which, by an Incomprehen&s;ible My&s;tery of Nature, they Vomit forth <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> their Mouths, and &s;pin out of their Bowels: And whatever is done of this kind in <HI>France,</HI> may much more, and to greater Ad|vantage be accompli&s;hed in the <HI>South-We&s;t-Part</HI> of <HI>New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> who&s;e Po&s;ition of <HI>Latitude</HI> is nearer the <HI>Sun,</HI> than any Part of <HI>France.</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="5">
The <HI>Air</HI> of this <HI>Province</HI> is very Serene, Sweet, and Whol&s;ome, which renders the <HI>Clime</HI> much more agreeable to <HI>European</HI> Bodies, than the &s;evere Colds of <HI>New-England,</HI> or the &s;ulphurous Heat in <HI>Virginia</HI>; where, I &s;ay, the Bogs, Mar&s;hes, and corrupt Standing-Waters, have ever been very Noxious to the Planter.</P>
<P>The Soyl of this <HI>Province</HI> is very Rich and Fruitful; and, for the mo&s;t part, upon a Ri&s;ing Level; and where it is interlaced with Hills, they are rather Gradual Pro&s;pects, than trouble&s;om A&s;cents for above an Hundred Miles from the Sea. And where it is any whit Mountainous or Rocky, there are al&s;o Valleys extream Rich and Fertile: Be&s;ides, tho&s;e Mountains have &s;tore of <HI>Black-Lead, Al|lom, Sulphur, Copper,</HI> &amp;c. the which is confirmed by the Writings of <HI>Tararapha,</HI> and <HI>Mon&s;ieur Gallane,</HI> Son to the pre&s;ent <HI>Pre&s;ident of Nants,</HI> a Per&s;on of great Quality, who &s;pent the Years 1668, 69, and 70. in the Di&s;covery of mo&s;t of the <HI>Lakes, Mountains,</HI> and <HI>Countries, West,</HI> from <HI>Quebeck</HI> to the <HI>Bay</HI> of <HI>Florida,</HI> which is be|yond <HI>Carolina.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Gentleman</HI> gave me leave to read his <HI>Journal</HI>; wherein he af|firms, That betwixt the Head of <HI>Delaware,</HI> and the <HI>Lake Ontaria,</HI> there are Mines of <HI>Sulphur, Allom, Lead, Copper,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> I mention This as well for your own Curio&s;ity, as that &s;uch a Trade may be worth looking after, when it &s;hall plea&s;e <HI>God,</HI> to put tho&s;e that &s;ettle your <HI>Colony,</HI> in a condition to ma|nage it; which, I do a&s;&s;ure you, in due time may be done, to Im|men&s;e Advantage.</P>
<P>And now, <HI>Sir,</HI> I &s;hall come to &s;ome other Ob&s;ervations of my own, having formerly drawn a particular <HI>Map</HI> of your <HI>Colony</HI> with my own Hand, by the Sea, from <HI>Sandy</HI>-point, and up the <HI>River,</HI> to the <HI>I&s;le</HI> of <HI>Matinicocks</HI>; and, for my own Satisfaction, did (as of o|ther Parts of <HI>America</HI>) ever make it my Bu&s;ine&s;s to di&s;cover not only the Scituation of Places; but al&s;o, the Original Di&s;coverers, the &s;everal Governors, and their re&s;pective Fortunes; the mo&s;t Remarkable Di&s;tempers, or Di&s;ea&s;es; the Commodities, both Na|tural and Accidental; what Advantage might be made by Trade; what Places were more or le&s;s Tenable by Nature, and what made Strong by Fortification; in what Manner, and to what Degree. Moreover, how tho&s;e <HI>Colonies</HI> have Pro&s;pered or Declined in Trade, Increa&s;ed or Decrea&s;ed in Number of Inhabitants from <HI>Europe,</HI> and the proper Cau&s;es thereof; together, with the Governments, Cu|&s;toms, and Commodities of the &s;everal <HI>Indian-Natives</HI>; and what
<PB N="9" REF="5">
Advantage might be made of tho&s;e Innocent, Good-natur'd <HI>Crea|tures,</HI> in point of Trade, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And this <HI>South-We&s;t-Part</HI> of <HI>New-We&s;t-Jer&s;ey,</HI> came not only un|der this my General Survey; but having had a Concern in tho&s;e Parts with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> it fell more particularly under my Con&s;ide|ration. The <HI>Longitude</HI> of this Place is Calculated to be from <HI>Three Hundred</HI> and <HI>Eleven,</HI> to <HI>Three Hundred</HI> and <HI>Eight</HI> Degrees; and bounded betwixt <HI>Thirty-Nine</HI> and <HI>Forty-Three</HI> Degrees of <HI>Latitude North,</HI> from the <HI>Aequator.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> Having before &s;poken of the Agreeablene&s;s of the <HI>Air</HI>; I &s;hall only &s;ay in general, that the <HI>We&s;t-Part</HI> of <HI>New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> is by Nature &s;liced into a bundance of <HI>Rivers</HI> and <HI>Riv'leis,</HI> which every way glide in Deep and Navigable <HI>Channels,</HI> either for Shipping or Boats, betwixt the Brea&s;t of this Your plentiful Country; which highly contributes to its Conveniency, Beauty, and Fertility. The&s;e <HI>Rivers</HI> are al&s;o abundantly &s;tored with all the <HI>&s;pecies</HI> of the <HI>Fi&s;h</HI> of <HI>Eu|rope,</HI> and both larger and better ta&s;ted; being great Quantities of <HI>Stur|geon</HI> in the <HI>River</HI> of <HI>Delaware,</HI> with divers other <HI>Fi&s;h</HI> peculiar only to that Clime; as <HI>Quictars, Dramps, Porgies</HI> or <HI>Sheep-Heads, Cony-Fi&s;h-Mi&s;yqua's,</HI> &amp; many others not &s;een in any Part of <HI>Europe,</HI> who&s;e names (at pre&s;ent) I remember not; but the&s;e in particular are delicate <HI>Fi&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>As al&s;o, <HI>Land</HI> and <HI>Sea-Foul</HI> in abundance of all the &s;orts in <HI>Eu|rope,</HI> and &s;ome peculiar to that <HI>Country</HI> (as of <HI>Fi&s;h</HI>) not any where in the <HI>Europaean</HI> World that ever I &s;aw. The <HI>Fruits</HI> of your <HI>Pro|vince</HI> are all &s;orts of Delicate <HI>Melons, Apples, Pears, Dam&s;ons</HI>; and all other &s;orts of <HI>Plumbs, Apricocks, Peaches,</HI> and <HI>Malagotoons, Cher|ries</HI> of &s;everal kinds, <HI>Quinces, Marucas, Grapes</HI> of Six &s;orts I have &s;een, <HI>Puchamines, Walnuts, Che&s;nuts, Strawberries, Rasberries, Cur|rans Red</HI> and <HI>White, Goo&s;eberries,</HI> and a great many other <HI>Wild-Fruits:</HI> As al&s;o, va&s;t plenty of <HI>Mulberries,</HI> all &s;orts of Roots of <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Potato's</HI> very good, with all &s;orts of <HI>Herbs</HI> both for <HI>Phy&s;ick,</HI> and the <HI>Kitchin,</HI> in great Perfection, and no le&s;s Plenty. There is al&s;o <HI>Saxafras, Sar&s;aparilla,</HI> and &s;everal other Plants of great vertue, grow Naturally in this <HI>Province.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> The <HI>We&s;tern-Part</HI> of <HI>New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> &s;ituate upon the <HI>River of Delaware,</HI> (to the Head whereof I under&s;tand Mr. <HI>Billing</HI>'s Grant reaches) &s;o far as I know, is not Second to any Part of <HI>America</HI>; and, in due time, by &s;uch Indu&s;trious Undertakers as Your Self, and <HI>Friends</HI> are, may not be Inferior to many Parts of the World: And this I further know, that with Common and Rea&s;onable Care,

there may not (in a few Years) only be to &s;pare <HI>Hor&s;es, Beef, Pork, Flower, Bisket, Pea&s;e,</HI> &amp;c. but this <HI>Country</HI> will al&s;o produce <HI>Honey, Wax, Silk, Hemp, Flax, Hops, Woad,</HI> and <HI>Rape-&s;eed, Madder, Pot-A&s;hes, Anni&s;eed,</HI> and <HI>Salt; Hides</HI> Raw or Tanned, and there is a va&s;t large Creature call'd a <HI>Moo&s;e,</HI> of who&s;e Skins are made Excellent <HI>Buff.</HI> and other <HI>Deer</HI>-Skins, and all &s;orts of <HI>Peltry</HI> in great Plenty; be&s;ides the Natural Product of <HI>Pitch, Tarr, Ro&s;in, Tur|pentine,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>And, as for <HI>Furrs</HI>; there is <HI>Beaver, Black Fox, Otter,</HI> and divers other &s;orts: As al&s;o, the <HI>Tobacco</HI> is very Good upon the <HI>River</HI> of <HI>Delaware.</HI> Be&s;ides what I have mentioned, there may be good Fi&s;h|ing for <HI>Cod</HI> and <HI>Cusk,</HI> which are to be found on a Fi&s;hing-ground, from the <HI>South-Part</HI> of the <HI>Shoald,</HI> that lyes of <HI>Barnagate,</HI> beginning at Seven Fathom Water, and trending <HI>South</HI> and by <HI>We&s;t,</HI> Nine Leagues in Length; there being great Plenty of well grown <HI>Fi&s;h,</HI> as I my &s;elf, and &s;everal others have found by Experience.</P>
<P>Upon the whole Matter, this <HI>Province</HI> affords all that is either for Nece&s;&s;ity, Convenience, Profit, or for the Plea&s;ure of Humane Life.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THrough the Mercy of <HI>God,</HI> we are &s;afely Arrived at <HI>New-Jer|&s;ey.</HI> My Wife, and all Mine are very well; and we have our Healths rather better <HI>Here,</HI> than we had in <HI>England</HI>: Indeed, the <HI>Country</HI> is &s;o likely, that I do not &s;ee, how it can rea&s;onably be found fault with. As far as I perceive, all of the Things we heard of it in <HI>England,</HI> are very true; and I wi&s;h, that many People (that are in Straits) in <HI>England,</HI> were <HI>Here: Here</HI> is Good Land enough lyes void, would &s;erve many <HI>Thou&s;ands</HI> of Families; and we think, if they cannot Live <HI>Here,</HI> they can hardly Live in any Place in the World. But we do not de&s;ire to per&s;wade any to come, but &s;uch as are well &s;atisfied in their own Minds. A Town-Lot is laid out for us in <HI>Bur|lington,</HI> which is a Convenient Place for a Trade: It is about <HI>One Hun|dred</HI> and <HI>Fifty</HI> Miles up the <HI>River of Delaware.</HI> The <HI>Country,</HI> and <HI>Air,</HI> &s;eems <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">o be very agreeable to our Bodies; and we have very Good Stomachs to our Victuals: And <HI>Here</HI> is plenty of Provi&s;ion in the <HI>Country,</HI> plenty of <HI>Fi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Fowl,</HI> and Good <HI>Veni&s;on</HI> very plen|tiful, and much better than Ours in <HI>England</HI>; for it eats not &s;o dry, but is full of Gravy, like Fat Young <HI>Beef.</HI> You that come after us, need not fear the Trouble that We have had: For now <HI>here</HI> is Land ready divided again&s;t You come. The <HI>Indians</HI> are very Loving to Us, except here and there one, when they have gotten Strong Liquors in their Heads, which they now greatly love. But for the <HI>Country,</HI> in &s;hort, I like it very well: And I do believe, that this <HI>River of De|laware,</HI> is as good a <HI>River</HI> as mo&s;t is in the World; it exceeds the <HI>Ri|ver of Thames</HI> by many Degrees.</P>
<P>Here is a <HI>Town</HI> laid out for <HI>Twenty Proprieties,</HI> and a &s;trait Line drawn from the <HI>River</HI>-&s;ide up the Land; which is to be the main Street, and a Market-place about the Middle; and the <HI>York-&s;hire Ten Proprietors</HI> are to build one Side, and the <HI>London Ten</HI> the other Side: And they have ordered one Street to be made along the <HI>Ri|ver</HI>-&s;ide, which is not divided with the Re&s;t, but in &s;mall Lots by it &s;elf; and every one that hath any Part in a Propriety, is to have his Share in it. The <HI>Town-Lots</HI> for every Propriety, will be

about <HI>Ten</HI> or <HI>Eleven</HI> Acres, which is only for a Hou&s;e, Orchard, and Gardens; and the Corn and Pa&s;ture-Ground is to be laid out in great Quantities</P>

<P>I Am, at this pre&s;ent, at the Town call'd <HI>Burlington,</HI> where our Land is; and it is ordered to be a Town for the <HI>Ten York-&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Ten London</HI> Proprietors. I like the Place well; our <HI>Lot</HI> is the Second next the Water-&s;ide: It's like to be a Healthful Place, and very plea&s;ant to Live in. I came hither Ye&s;ter-day, being the <HI>Twenty-Seventh</HI> of <HI>October,</HI> with &s;ome <HI>Friends</HI> that were going to <HI>New-York.</HI> I am to be at <HI>Thomas Olive</HI>'s Hou&s;e, till &s;uch time I can provide better for my Self.

<P>I Can now give you a farther Account concerning this <HI>Country</HI>; for I have Travelled <HI>Three</HI> or <HI>Four Hundred</HI> Miles an End, the be&s;t Part of it by Land. I have been in <HI>New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> and like that Place very well; and I am &s;ure, it is the Fruitfulle&s;t Place in the&s;e Parts, and the Plea&s;ante&s;t to dwell in: For there is all &s;orts of Provi&s;ion as plentiful as it is in <HI>England</HI>; There wants nothing but good Hone&s;t People to Inhabit it. The Ship that was bound for <HI>New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> arrived about the <HI>Second</HI> or <HI>Third</HI> Day of this Month; I was in <HI>New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> when She came in; I was the Fir&s;t, that &s;aw Her: So the next Day, I went Aboard of Her; and the People told me, They were <HI>Eight</HI> Weeks at Sea; and the fir&s;t Land they made, was <HI>Cape-Codd</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> which was an <HI>Hundred Leagues</HI> out of their way: And they were at a great Lo&s;s for want of a <HI>Pilot</HI> to carry them along the Shore; but while they were at <HI>Sea,</HI> they wanted for nothing. Now I have &s;een mo&s;t of the&s;e Parts hereabout; and, to my thinking, <HI>New-Jer&s;ey</HI> exceeds them All for good Land, good Timber, good Meadow, and other good Conveniences that are <HI>Here:</HI> For <HI>One</HI> Acre in this Place, is worth half a dozen in other Pla|ces that lye <HI>Hereabouts</HI>; and I could be very glad, that You and Your Family were &s;afe arrived <HI>Here.</HI> But, I hope, I &s;hall &s;ee you all in <HI>London</HI> within the&s;e <HI>Three</HI> Months; and then I &s;hall give you a better Account concerning our Affairs.

An Extract of a Letter written by <HI>John Crips,</HI> to his Brother and Si&s;ter.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear &amp; Loving Brother &amp; Si&s;ter!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have received both your Letters, wherein I under&s;tand your Faith concerning this <HI>Country</HI> is much &s;haken through &s;everal fal&s;e Re|ports given thereof; which may be proved fal&s;e under the <HI>hands</HI> of &s;e|veral good <HI>Friends,</HI> I hope as worthy to be believed as that Reporter; and &s;uch as have had more Experience of this Place, than he had or could have in &s;o &s;hort a time. Be&s;ides, he came among&s;t us &s;hort|ly after our coming hither, when things were not &s;ettl'd in that Or|der among&s;t us as now they are. Neither indeed did he find &s;uch Entertainment from &s;ome, as he expected; which <HI>I</HI> &s;uppo&s;e makes him &s;peak the wor&s;t he can devi&s;e of this Place. But <HI>I</HI> que&s;tion not, but his Reports will in a &s;hort time be wip'd away: Some of which, in my Knowledge, are gro&s;s Lyes, as well as Contradicti|ons to his own VVords. For <HI>I</HI> remember, when <HI>I</HI> Travelled with him through Part of <HI>New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> he confe&s;&s;ed, That much of this Land was as good or better, than the Land in <HI>Road-I&s;land.</HI></P>
<P>And it's really my judgment that tho&s;e people that cannot be con|tented with &s;uch a Country, and &s;uch Land as this is, they are not wor|thy to come here. And this I can truly tell you if I were now in <HI>Eng|land</HI> with you my Friends, (and which I &s;hould be very glad to &s;ee) yet if all <HI>I</HI> had in the World would but bring me hither, <HI>I</HI> &s;hould freely leave You, and my Native-Country, and come to <HI>New-Jer|&s;ey</HI> again; which <HI>I</HI> have &s;aid many a time heretofore; but now <HI>I</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="9">
write it under my Hand; and it's really the Truth, whether you will believe it or not. And farther, <HI>I</HI> can truly tell you, That <HI>I</HI> de&s;ire not, nor dare not to write the lea&s;t Untruth to draw you, or any others to this Place: But an re&s;olved, if <HI>I</HI> never &s;ee your Face more, to leave you to your own Freedom in the <HI>Lord.</HI> But <HI>I</HI> hope, you are not in&s;en&s;ible of my Love, and De&s;ires for You; though <HI>I</HI> am (<HI>I</HI> &s;ay) con&s;train'd to Forbear per&s;wading. You, or any one el&s;e, again&s;t their own Freedoms: yet <HI>I</HI> think it my Du|ty to let You, and all Men know the Truth of things as near as <HI>I</HI> can.</P>
<P>Your Letter &s;aith, it's reported, <HI>the water is not &s;o good as in Eng|land.</HI> I do not remember, that ever I ta&s;ted better water in any part of <HI>England,</HI> than the &s;prings of this Place do yeild; of which is made very good <HI>bear,</HI> and <HI>Ale</HI>; And here is al&s;o <HI>Wine</HI> and <HI>Sider.</HI> And whereas your Letter to me &s;aith, <HI>&s;everal have come back from this Country to England</HI>; Two or Three, I &s;uppo&s;e, there are Lazy idle per&s;ons, that have done &s;o. But on the other hand here are &s;everal per&s;ons, Men of E&s;tates, that have been <HI>here,</HI> and have gone back to <HI>England,</HI> and &s;old their E&s;tates, and return'd with their whole fami|lies hither again; which methinks, &s;hould take many of the&s;e Scruples out of the way, if nothing el&s;e were &s;aid or done in prai&s;e of this <HI>Country.</HI> But, I &s;uppo&s;e, there are many in <HI>England,</HI> that de&s;ire to hear ill of this Place, becau&s;e they would keep their <HI>Friends</HI> there with them, and they think, we never write enough of the bad Pro|perties of the <HI>Country</HI> and <HI>Vermin</HI> in it. Now, this I may &s;ay in &s;hort, That here are <HI>Bears, Wolves, Foxes Rattle-&s;nakes,</HI> and &s;everal other Creatures, (I do believe) becau&s;e I &s;ee the <HI>Indians</HI> have &s;uch Skins to &s;ell. But I have Travelled &s;everal <HI>hundreds</HI> of Miles to and fro, and I never (to my knowledge) &s;aw one of tho&s;e Creatures, ex|cept two <HI>Rattle-&s;nakes,</HI> and I kill'd them both. I &s;uppo&s;e, the Fear of tho&s;e Creatures in <HI>England,</HI> is far wor&s;e to &s;ome <HI>there,</HI> than the Hurt of them is <HI>here.</HI> And as for the <HI>Musketto-Fly,</HI> we are not troubled with them in this Place; our Land for the mo&s;t part Lying high and healthy, and they for the mo&s;t part are in Law Boggy ground. <HI>Thomas Budd,</HI> and his Family are arrived, the &s;hip Lieth before this Town that brought them: I wi&s;h, you have not cau&s;e to repent, that you came not along with them. They had a very good Pa&s;&s;age, and &s;o had the <HI>London Ship</HI>; they are both in the Ri|ver at this time. I under&s;tand by <HI>Thomas Budd,</HI> that he did &s;atis|fie you as near as he could, of the Truth of things <HI>here</HI>; and you had
<PB N="17" REF="9">
as much rea&s;on to believe him, as that other per&s;on, and more too; for <HI>Thomas</HI> had far more Experience of this Place, than he (I &s;ay) could have in the &s;hort time he was among us. So of the&s;e things, I &s;hall forbear to write any farther at pre&s;ent; and with my true love to you all, my <HI>Friends,</HI> with my hearts De&s;ire for your Well|fare every way, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I re&s;t</P>

<P>BUt now a word, or two of tho&s;e &s;trange Reports you have of Us, and our <HI>Country</HI>; I affirm, they are Lyes in the very Ground of them, and &s;poken from a Spirit of Envy: It is a <HI>Country,</HI> that produceth all things for the Support, and Su&s;tenance of Man, in a

If it were not &s;o, <HI>I</HI> &s;hould be a&s;hamed of what <HI>I</HI> have before written: But <HI>I</HI> can &s;tand, having Truth on my Side, again&s;t and before the Face of all Gain-&s;ayers, and evil Spies. <HI>I</HI> have Travelled through mo&s;t of the Places that are &s;ettled, and &s;ome that are not; and in every Place, <HI>I</HI> find the <HI>Country</HI> very apt to an&s;wer the Expectation of the Diligent. <HI>I</HI> have &s;een <HI>Orchards</HI> &s;o loaden with <HI>Fruit, I</HI> have wondered to &s;ee it, their very Limbs torn in pieces with the weight of their <HI>Fruit</HI>; and mo&s;t Delicious to the Ta&s;te, and Lovely to behold. <HI>I</HI> have &s;een an <HI>Apple-Tree</HI> from a <HI>Pippin-Kernel,</HI> yield a Barrel of curious <HI>Syder</HI>; and <HI>Peaches</HI> in &s;uch plen|ty, that &s;ome People took their Carts a <HI>Peach</HI>-gathering: <HI>I</HI> could not but &s;mile at the Conceit of it. They are a very delicate <HI>Fruit,</HI> and hang almo&s;t like our <HI>Onions</HI> that are tyed on Ropes. <HI>I</HI> have &s;een and known this <HI>Summer Forty</HI> Bu&s;hels of good <HI>Bold-Wheat,</HI> of <HI>One</HI> Bu&s;hel &s;own: And many more &s;uch In&s;tances <HI>I</HI> could bring, which would be too tedious here to mention.

My Brother <HI>Robert</HI> had as many <HI>Cherries</HI> this Year, as would have loaded &s;everal Carts. It is my Judgment, by what <HI>I</HI> have ob&s;erved, That <HI>Fruit-Trees</HI> in this <HI>Country</HI> de&s;troy them&s;elves, by the very Weight of their <HI>Fruit.</HI> As for <HI>Veni&s;on,</HI> and <HI>Fowles,</HI> here are great plenty: We have brought Home to our Hou&s;es by the <HI>Indians, Seven</HI> or <HI>Eight</HI> Fat <HI>Bucks</HI> of a day; and &s;ometimes put by as many, having no Occa&s;ion for them. And <HI>Fi&s;h</HI> in their Sea&s;on very plenteous: My Cou&s;in <HI>Revill,</HI> and <HI>I,</HI> with &s;ome of my Men, went la&s;t <HI>Third</HI> Moneth called <HI>May,</HI> into the <HI>River</HI> to catch <HI>Herrings</HI>; for at that time they come in great Shoals into the Shal|low's; we had neither Rod, nor Net; but after the <HI>Indian</HI> Fa&s;hion, made a round Pinfold about <HI>Two Yards</HI> over, and a Foot high; but left a Gap for the <HI>Fi&s;h</HI> to go in at, and made a Bu&s;h to lay in the Gap to keep the <HI>Fi&s;h</HI> in&punc; and when that was done, we took <HI>Two</HI> long Birches &amp; tyed their Tops together; &amp; went about a Stones-ca&s;t above our &s;aid Pinfold: Then hauling the&s;e Birche's Boughs down
<PB N="23" REF="12">
the Stream, where we drove <HI>Thou&s;ands</HI> before us: But &s;o many got into our Trap as it would hold; and then we began to haul them to Shoar, as fa&s;t as <HI>Three</HI> or <HI>Four</HI> of us could, by <HI>Two</HI> or <HI>Three</HI> at a time: And after this manner, in half an Hour, we could have fil|led a <HI>Three-Bu&s;hel</HI> Sack of as good and large <HI>Herrings,</HI> as over <HI>I</HI> &s;aw. And as to <HI>Beef</HI> and <HI>Pork,</HI> here is great plenty of it, and good cheap; and al&s;o, good <HI>Sheep:</HI> The common Gra&s;s of this <HI>Country</HI> feeds <HI>Beef</HI> very Fat; <HI>I</HI> have Kill'd <HI>Two</HI> this Year; and therefore, <HI>I</HI> have rea&s;on to know: Be&s;ides, <HI>I</HI> have &s;een this <HI>Fall,</HI> in <HI>Burling|ton,</HI> Kill'd <HI>Eight</HI> or <HI>Nine</HI> Fat <HI>Oxen</HI> and <HI>Cowes</HI> on a Market-Day, and all very fat. And though <HI>I</HI> &s;peak of <HI>Herrings</HI> only, and le&s;t any &s;hould think we have little other &s;orts, we have great plenty of mo&s;t &s;orts of <HI>Fi&s;h,</HI> that ever <HI>I</HI> &s;aw in <HI>England</HI>; be&s;ides &s;everal other &s;orts that are not known <HI>There</HI>; as <HI>Rocks, Cat-Fi&s;h, Shoads, Sheep-Heads, Sturgeons:</HI> And <HI>Fowles</HI> plenty; as <HI>Ducks, Gee&s;e, Turkies, Swans, Phea&s;ants, Partridges</HI>; and many other &s;orts that <HI>I</HI> cannot remember, and would be too tedious to mention&punc; Indeed the <HI>Country,</HI> take it as a <HI>Wilderne&s;s,</HI> is a brave <HI>Country</HI>; Though no Place will plea&s;e all; but &s;ome will be ready to &s;ay, <HI>He writes of Conveniences, but not of Inconveniences:</HI> In an&s;wer to tho&s;e, <HI>I</HI> hone&s;t|ly declare, Here is al&s;o &s;ome Barren Land; as (<HI>I</HI> &s;uppo&s;e) there is in mo&s;t Places of the World; and more Wood, than &s;ome would have upon their Lands.

<P>THis may give you an Account of Mine, and my Families &s;afe Ar|rival in <HI>New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> with all the Re&s;t that came forth with us: I might &s;ay &s;omething concerning our Pa&s;&s;age at <HI>Sea</HI>; but I wave it for want of Time: and, in fine, can &s;ay all was well; for which, I ble&s;s <HI>God,</HI> and the <HI>Lord</HI> keep us all &s;en&s;ible of it, with the re&s;t of His Mercies for ever.</P>

<P>But it may be demanded, Why the&s;e <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Swedes,</HI> e&s;peci|ally &s;ome of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> that came lately, &s;hould &s;eat on the Other Side of the <HI>River,</HI> rather than in <HI>New-Jer&s;ey?</HI> The only Rea&s;on, as a Rea&s;on, that I can give, was becau&s;e of the Cu&s;tome impo|&s;ed at <HI>New-Jer&s;ey</HI> heretofore, and the Government not being &s;ettled, as now it is.</P>
<P>And moreover, the Land on the other &s;ide next the <HI>River</HI> (upon which the&s;e People are &s;et down) for the mo&s;t part is a deeper Soyl, and le&s;s Wood upon it, than upon &s;ome of the Land on your &s;ide over again&s;t it; for that much of the riche&s;t Soil and be&s;t Land in <HI>New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> lyeth not upon the very Brink of the <HI>River,</HI> but &s;omewhat back|ward into the <HI>Country</HI>; which is a conveniency of no &s;mall value to &s;uch Planters, who truly under&s;tand the erecting, and &s;ettling of <HI>Co|lony</HI>'s next the Water-&s;ide in the&s;e Parts.
