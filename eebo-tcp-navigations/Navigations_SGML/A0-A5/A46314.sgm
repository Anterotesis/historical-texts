<HEAD>A JOURNAL OF THE War with <HI>Holland,</HI> From His Maje&s;ties departure from <HI>Paris,</HI> until his return.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">According to the order of Action and Time.</HEAD>
<P>THE States of Holland were rai&s;ed in a &s;hort time to &s;uch a pitch of Pride and In&s;olence, that 'twas impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould maintain it long. Their Irreligion was &s;o great, that Heaven could no more be deaf to the ju&s;t complaints of the Oppre&s;&s;ed. They were &s;o blind, as to take no notice of the Favors of that Monarch, who had, as it were, rai&s;ed them out of nothing: and they pretended to give Law to tho&s;e Powers,
<PB N="24" REF="14">from whom, not long before, they had had petition'd to receive it. In fine, their Am|bition, their Tyranny, and their Ingrati|tude did exceed all bounds: and they were &s;o puft up with the thoughts of being Princes, and under&s;tood withal &s;o little what Soveraignty was, that they imagined all the World ought to &s;toop and pay Obe|dience to them.</P>
<P>There was then a nece&s;&s;ity that &s;ome one or other &s;hould charitably interpo&s;e to di&s;|abu&s;e them; and none could undertake that Work more effectually, then our Great Mo|narch. That care was his particular concern, and none had &s;o great an Intere&s;t in it as Him&s;elf. He had the Power, and nothing was wanting but a Will; which he is always rea|dy to exert, when&s;oever &s;o ju&s;t an occa&s;ion offers it &s;elf. As being <HI>The mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King,</HI> He was obliged to undertake the de|fence of the Church: as one that had rai&s;ed them, 'twas His Intere&s;t to cha&s;ti&s;e their In|gratitude&punc; and as being the mo&s;t ab&s;olute Monarch in the World, it became His glory to maintain His Soveraignty. 'Twas this that obliged Him to declare War, and to put Him&s;elf at the head of a Hundred thou|&s;and Men, to teach them &s;uch Le&s;&s;ons, as they &s;hould never forget.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty parted from S. <HI>Germains,</HI> on
<PB N="25" REF="14">Thur&s;day the 28. of April, in the Year 1672, and having taken the way of <HI>Soi&s;&s;ons,</HI> He arrived at <HI>Rocroy</HI> the &s;econd of May en|&s;uing, where the Troops, that were to com|po&s;e his Army, began to <HI>rendevouz;</HI> as tho&s;e, which were to make an Army for Mon&s;ieur the Prince, did at <HI>Sedan.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ame day we came al&s;o to <HI>Rocroy,</HI> by the way of <HI>Fymes, Rheimes,</HI> and <HI>Retel.</HI></P>
<P>The third of May in the Morning, His Maje&s;ty parted with all His Forces from <HI>Rocroy,</HI> and came to <HI>Mariemburg,</HI> where we were &s;carcely encamped, but he command|ed the Marquis <HI>de Ranes</HI> to advance towards <HI>Philipville;</HI> which we pre&s;ently did, and found there &s;everal Troops.</P>
<P>The fourth, His Maje&s;ty came to <HI>Philip|ville,</HI> and we, with the Troops that we found there, marched to <HI>Charleroy,</HI> where all the Army gathered into a Body, during &s;even or eight days that His Maje&s;ty re&s;ided there.</P>
<P>The fifth, the King arrived at <HI>Charleroy:</HI> And having had intelligence, that 3000 Hor&s;e and 600 Foot were march'd out of <HI>Mae&s;tricht,</HI> and run along the <HI>Meu&s;e,</HI> with de&s;ign to plunder the Boats that brought our Provi&s;ions from <HI>Huy</HI> to <HI>Leige;</HI> and that they were come up to the Gates of <HI>Huy,</HI> and being denyed entrance there, had threatned

At length our Provi&s;ions pa&s;&s;ed on guarded with 100 Hor&s;e, that marched along the River on the left hand, and &s;ecured with a 100 Dragoons, that were placed at the ave|nues on the right hand: and being arrived over again&s;t the Ca&s;tle and our Camp, the Guard of Dragoons was made to enter the Boats, and that of the Hor&s;e was doubled, which marched all night as far as <HI>Leige,</HI> and returned again.</P>
<P>The ninth in the Morning, we went back, and encamped at <HI>Fallais,</HI> a Village of <HI>Br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">|bant,</HI> belonging to the Spaniards, where Mon&s;ieur the Marquis <HI>de Louvois</HI> joyned with us, who came thither about ten in the Morning with a Guard of 500 Hor&s;e; and afterwards about three in the Afternoon parted from us with 120 Hor&s;e, and went to <HI>Leige.</HI> The Enemy now began to &s;hut them&s;elves up, and i&s;&s;ued out no more in a great Body, but only as Pickeerers, 12, 15, or 20 in a Company, and killed a Quarter|ma&s;ter, and &s;ix of the Hor&s;e men that guard|ed Mon&s;ieur the Marquis <HI>de Louvois,</HI> and
<PB N="28" REF="16">had tarryed a little behind the re&s;t. The &s;ame Evening two others, who had bin foraging in a Village, were killed by the Enemy, who had hid them&s;elves, and pretended they were Spaniards, belonging to &s;ome of the Spani&s;h Garri&s;ons.</P>
<P>The tenth, we march'd to <HI>Bierzey,</HI> and came near again to <HI>Leige.</HI> The &s;ame day Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> left the King (who tar|ryed &s;till at <HI>Charleroy</HI>) and advanced with one part of the Troops, of which he formed an Army for him&s;elf. The Troops that had convoy'd Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Louvois,</HI> rejoin'd with us, and he him&s;elf tarryed at <HI>Leige.</HI></P>
<P>The eleventh, Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> con|tinued his march, and we &s;tayed at <HI>Bierzey.</HI> Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Louvois</HI> &s;ent word, that we &s;hould di&s;patch in the Evening a hundred Dragoons to guard them along; w^c^h Mon&s;ieur the Marquis <HI>de Ranes</HI> &s;ent him. In the mean time Mon&s;ieur the Prince marched &s;lowly on with his Army on the other &s;ide of the <HI>Meu&s;e,</HI> on the right hand.</P>
<P>The twelfth in the morning, Mon&s;ieur the Marquis <HI>de Louvois</HI> returned from <HI>Leige,</HI> and we being joyned with the Army of Mon|&s;ieur <HI>de Turenne,</HI> went to encamp at <HI>Greville</HI> near <HI>Tongren,</HI> which we took without re|&s;i&s;tance, and placed a Garri&s;on in it. Mon|&s;ieur the Count <HI>de Chamilly,</HI> came to us from
<PB N="29" REF="16"><HI>Huy,</HI> where he had bin before.</P>
<P>The thirteenth, Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> &s;taid at <HI>Greville,</HI> but he &s;ent away the Foot Regi|ments of <HI>Al&s;ace</HI> and <HI>Languedoc,</HI> that made &s;ix Bodies, three Companies of Dragoons of the Regiment <HI>Royall,</HI> that came to 300 men, the Hor&s;e Regiments <HI>de Joyeu&s;e, de Tury, de Ga&s;&s;ion, de S. Loup, de Rouville,</HI> and &s;ome others. This party was commanded by Mon&s;ieur the Count <HI>de Chamilly.</HI> After|wards we went to <HI>Bil&s;em.</HI></P>
<P>The fourteenth, we went and encamped at <HI>Rakem,</HI> which lies two Leagues on the other &s;ide of <HI>Mae&s;trickt,</HI> and within one of <HI>Mae&s;iick.</HI> M. <HI>de Turenne</HI> followed us with his Army; and the King marched another way near <HI>Viz&egrave;,</HI> 2 Leagues above <HI>Mae&s;tricht.</HI> The 15. in the morning, we came up within &s;ight of <HI>Mai&s;iich,</HI> where the army being drawn up, M. the Count <HI>de Chamilly</HI> &s;ummon'd the Town, which not &s;eeming aver&s;e to a Parley, he went in, but they not agreeing upon Conditions, command was given to prepare Faggots, and we began to rai&s;e a Battery for four pieces of Canon; and not &s;taying to throw up Trenches, &s;ome Com|panies of Foot were drawn out, and com|manded to come up under the &s;helter of &s;ome thick Hedges, and old Walls which lay near the Town-ditch. All this was done by two in the Afternoon, and then we began
<PB N="30" REF="17">to play upon the Town, which did the like upon us. They held out about five hours, and defended them&s;elves well enough. In this Action we lo&s;t in all but one or two Of|ficers, and &s;ome few common Soldiers, and the Enemy had not above 3 or 4 men killed: but notwith&s;tanding, about 7 of the Clock they beat a Parley, and denr'd to Treat; whereupon the Count <HI>de Chamilly,</HI> and the <HI>Sieur de Ranes</HI> went in again, and came not back till the Town was &s;urrendred; and in the mean time, the Chevalier <HI>du Ple&s;&s;is,</HI> Camp Mar&s;hal to the Army, commanded the Attaque.</P>
<P>But before this, not imagining the Place would, have yielded &s;o &s;oon, advice was given thereof to Mare&s;hal <HI>Turenne,</HI> who thereupon advanced, and was very near when the Marquis <HI>de Ranes</HI> took Hor&s;e and left the Town, which had ju&s;t now yielded, to adverti&s;e him of it. Whereupon he made a halt, and encamp'd with his Army pretty near ours, and him&s;elf retir'd into one of the M. <HI>de Ranes</HI>'s Hou&s;es, who went back imme|diatly into the Town to Count <HI>de Chamilly</HI> and thence they both return'd to <HI>Mar&s;ha Turenne.</HI> This Action gave occa&s;ion to &s;ome Dutch Railery, who thereupon told that the French had taken <HI>Mae&s;tricht,</HI> no no, I mi&s;|take would they &s;ay, 'tis <HI>Mae&s;iick:</HI> but this was the la&s;t time they were in a ralling hu|mor;
<PB N="31" REF="17">for &s;ince then we have dealt with them in &s;uch earne&s;t, that they have not had time to bethink them&s;elves, or give their minds to &s;o much relaxation, as to be in a fit of drol|ling or playing the <HI>Satyri&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ixteenth, we left the <HI>Sieur Chamilly</HI> at <HI>Mae&s;iick</HI> with his Troops, and Mon&s;ieur <HI>du Ple&s;&s;is,</HI> to &s;ee to the fortifying of the Place. The Marquis <HI>de Ranes</HI> coa&s;ted along the River towards <HI>Mae&s;tricht</HI> with three Companies of Dragoons, and took all the Boats he met with, to the number of 25, and had them all brought back up the River to the Abby of <HI>Ocq,</HI> where we were by that time encamped, and where at our coming we found Mon&s;ieur <HI>Vaubrun</HI> Camp Mar&s;hal, with a part of the Army which he there com|manded.</P>
<P>The 17^t^h in the Morning, we left that Par|ty to the conduct of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Vaubrun</HI> their Commander, and march'd with &s;ome Guides to <HI>Viz&egrave;,</HI> whether His Maje&s;ty came al&s;o the &s;ame day; but in our March, coming with|in Canon &s;hot of <HI>Mae&s;tricht,</HI> there i&s;&s;ued out thence &s;ome Hor&s;e, one part of which &s;eem'd to turn off towards Mon&s;ieur <HI>Van|brun</HI>'s Camp, and the other to advance to|wards us. The <HI>Sieurs T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">renne,</HI> and <HI>de Ranes,</HI> made up towards them, but they thereupon nimbly retir'd, the Enemy only letting fly 30 or 40 Canon, and &s;ome volleys of &s;mall
<PB N="32" REF="18">Shot at us, which did no harm. A League from thence, we met the Count <HI>de Lorge</HI> with his flying Army, who had encamp'd hard by, upon the way to <HI>Tongres:</HI> He drew near likewi&s;e to <HI>Mae&s;tricht,</HI> and be&s;et it clo&s;ely on his &s;ide, as Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Vaubrun</HI> had on the other.</P>
<P>The 18. the King went to take a view of the out-works of the <HI>Fort ...</HI> w^c^h belongs to the Spaniard, and lies on the right from the <HI>Meu&s;e,</HI> near a League from <HI>Viz&egrave;,</HI> and two from <HI>Mae&s;tricht:</HI> he was &s;aluted by the Garri&s;on, which is always very &s;trong, with many great Guns, and volleys of &s;mall &s;hot,</P>
<P>The 19. Mon&s;ieur the Prince encamped within two Leagues of us, and came the &s;ame day with Mon&s;ieur the Duke, to vi&s;it the King; and afterwards (having fir&s;t been at Council) return'd to his Camp.</P>
<P>The 20. the Kings Army, as al&s;o that of the Prince, re&s;ted.</P>
<P>The 21. They re&s;ted again, and a Bridge of Boats was begun upon the <HI>Meu&s;e</HI> below <HI>Viz&egrave;.</HI> Mon&s;ieur <HI>Vaubrun</HI> went and joyned his Troops to tho&s;e of Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Chamilly,</HI> who have &s;ince been employ'd, almo&s;t du|ring all the re&s;t of the Campaigne, in forti|fying <HI>Ma&s;eick,</HI> and in cour&s;ing about <HI>Ma|&s;tricht.</HI></P>
<PB N="33" REF="18">
<P>The 22. they continued working about the Bridge, which was well forwarded. The &s;ame day the Prince's Army march'd.</P>
<P>The twenty third, His Maje&s;ty re&s;ted again, the Bridge was fini&s;h'd, and the <HI>Collonel</HI> Regiment of Dragoons left <HI>Viz&egrave;</HI> to go and joyn with the Army of Mon&s;ieur the Prince, under whom it &s;erv'd during the re&s;t of the Campaigne. Three Companies of the Regiment <HI>Royall,</HI> which had been left about <HI>Mae&s;tricht,</HI> came back. The heavy bag|gage pa&s;t the River all that day. In the e|vening &s;ome were drawn out of the Kings <HI>Hou&s;hold</HI> to go and get Intelligence of the Enemy toward <HI>Mae&s;tricht:</HI> it fell to the lot of the Marquis of <HI>Saurebeuf,</HI> a younger Brother, one of the Kings Guards, to be fir&s;t pick'd out to go, and &s;ee what might be di&s;cover'd at the Palli&s;ado. He brought back word to the Brigadier of Mu&s;que|teers who commanded the Party, that he had &s;een a Sentinel without the Palli&s;ado, and within many lighted matches, which made him think it was well man'd. The Commander not being &s;atisfied with this ac|count, told him, That would not &s;erve his turn, and that the King would know whe|ther any body had gone out of the place or no, wherefore he mu&s;t return and do his utmo&s;t to learn that; which he pre&s;ently did, and going &s;treight to the Sentinel, ask'd
<PB N="34" REF="19">him, If the Party that went out that day, were yet return'd; to which, he receiv'd no other an&s;wer then a Musket-&s;hot in his throat, that was followed by at lea&s;t forty more, which however mi&s;t him; but the fir&s;t wound was in &s;o dangerous a place, that he immediatly fell, and was altogether una|ble to make his E&s;cape; &s;o that the Enemies carryed him into the Town, where he was long kept Pri&s;oner and ill of his wound.</P>
<P>The 24. His Maje&s;ty pa&s;s'd the <HI>Maes</HI> upon the bridge of Boats, with the whole Army, except only Five hundred Foot, which were drawn out by lot to be left in Garri&s;on at <HI>Viz&egrave;,</HI> a little Town lying on the right &s;ide of the <HI>Maes,</HI> between <HI>Mae&s;tricht</HI> and <HI>Liege;</HI> &s;o we went and encamp'd at <HI>Biernaw</HI> upon the little River <HI>Berwine,</HI> in the Coun|try of <HI>Limbourg.</HI> The &s;ame day in the morn|ing, Mon&s;ieur the Vicount of <HI>Turenne,</HI> and the Marquis <HI>de Ranes,</HI> march'd with &s;ome Hor&s;e and Dragoons to the Fort call'd <HI>Fou|quemont,</HI> (otherwi&s;e <HI>Fauquenton,</HI> or <HI>Valkem|borg.</HI>) This is a Ca&s;tle three hours Journey from <HI>Mac&s;tricht,</HI> on the other &s;ide of the Ri|ver, built on a &s;teep Rock; at the Foot of which there is a great Town, bearing the &s;ame name, and depending on it. There was in it a Garri&s;on for the Hollander, but upon notice of the march of the fore&s;aid
<PB N="35" REF="19">Per&s;ons, they retir'd into <HI>Mae&s;tricht,</HI> and quitted the Ca&s;tle, though it be inacce&s;&s;ible and impregnable without Canon. There are within it Caves of a Prodigious depth and bigne&s;s, wherein a whole Army might be hid: there was little Provi&s;ion in it, for which rea&s;on the Sieur <HI>de la Ro&uuml;illardiere,</HI> Captain of a Company of Dragoons, who was left there with One hundred men, was forc'd to buy &s;ome from the Town, and o|ther neighboring places; the King having ordered, That he &s;hould take nothing but what was paid for.</P>
<P>The 25. His Maje&s;ty re&s;ted.</P>
<P>The 26. the Kings Army &s;till re&s;ted, and nothing extraordinary pa&s;&s;ed. Mon&s;ieur the Prince &s;till march'd forward toward the <HI>Rhine,</HI> upon the re&s;olution which had been taken not to &s;et upon <HI>Mae&s;tricht,</HI> but to go &s;traight on and take the places which lie a|long that River, and &s;o drive &s;traight for|wards into Holland.</P>
<P>The 27. at night, the Weather grew very bad, and in the morning it was very cloudy and louring, but we departed notwith&s;tand|ing, and came to <HI>Willers,</HI> where the Rain did not a little incommode us.</P>
<P>The 28. The Weather being good a|gain, the King went and encamp'd at <HI>Rolduc,</HI> and upon &s;ome Intelligence, a Coun|cil
<PB N="36" REF="20">was call'd, where it was re&s;olv'd, That Mon&s;ieur <HI>Turenne</HI> &s;hould march on with 15000, or 16000 men, which he did: but this Order not having been fore&s;een, many of tho&s;e who were commanded to accom|pany him having march'd before, went on with the Kings Army, till being told of their duty, they were forc'd to march all night to overtake the Army of Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Turenne,</HI> who went and encamp'd at <HI>Erkelens.</HI></P>
<P>The 29. the King came within half a League of <HI>Juliers,</HI> and Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> encamp'd at <HI>Telns,</HI> a little Village between <HI>Nuis</HI> and <HI>Kei&s;erwort,</HI> in the Country of <HI>Co|len.</HI> The &s;ame day the Prince's Army pa&s;s'd the <HI>Rhine</HI> upon a certain Float of Wood, w^c^h carryed 2000 Foot and 200 Hor&s;e, with all their baggage at a time: and his Highne&s;s and the Duke of <HI>Newbourg</HI> treated them &s;o well at their arrival at <HI>Kei&s;erwort,</HI> that they were all very merry, which yet hinder'd not the Duke of <HI>Newbourg</HI> from coming in the Evening to &s;ee Mon&s;ieur de <HI>Turenne,</HI> and to invite him to Dinner the next day.</P>
<P>The 30. We &s;tayed at <HI>Telns.</HI> Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> dined with the Duke of <HI>New|bourg,</HI> and in the Evening at his return he had 96 Pri&s;oners brought him, &s;ent by Mon|&s;ieur <HI>de Montal,</HI> Governor of <HI>Charleroy,</HI> who commanding a Party of our Troops, had
<PB N="37" REF="20">fallen into an Ambu&s;h of theirs, and with five or &s;ix more had born up again&s;t all their Firing, among&s;t whom <HI>Mon&s;ieur the Che|valier de Mar&s;illac</HI> was mortally wounded. In the mean time, forty Dragoons lighted off their Hor&s;es, and with 30 Mu&s;queteers, did &s;o be&s;tir them&s;elves, that before the Enemy could make a &s;econd di&s;charge, they had quite routed them, kill'd eleven, and took their Commander (who defended him|&s;elf &s;o manfully, that they were forced to u&s;e him wor&s;e then they de&s;ir'd) with all the re&s;t, excepting 2 or 3 who at fir&s;t betook them&s;elves to their heels. Afterwards, the Ca|ptain being known by &s;ome of the Officers of our Party, had quarter given him; &amp; be|ing not yet dead, all po&s;&s;ible means were us'd to &s;ave his Life. He was carryed off in|to a Ca&s;tle, where Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> &s;ent him his own Chirurgion, but to little pur|po&s;e, for he dyed &s;oon after. The re&s;t of the Pri&s;oners were brought to <HI>Nuis,</HI> where Mon|&s;ieur <HI>de Strasbourg</HI> arriv'd the &s;ame day, and was &s;aluted with the great Guns of the Town.</P>
<P>The 31. in the Morning, Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Tu|renne</HI> took with him a party of the <HI>Corps de Guard,</HI> all the Light Guards of the Kings Hou&s;hold, three Companies of the Regi|ment <HI>Royall</HI> of Dragoons, a part of the Re|giment
<PB N="38" REF="21">of the French Guards, and &s;ome Light Hor&s;e; who, after having winter'd in the Country of <HI>Colen,</HI> came by order of His Maje&s;ty to encamp and intrench them|&s;elves upon the banks of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> on the left &s;ide near <HI>Kei&s;erwort,</HI> where they encamped &amp; fortified them&s;elves very commodiou&s;ly. Afterwards we march'd all day, and en|camp'd under a great Hill above <HI>Or&s;oy.</HI> The King march'd on to <HI>Nuys,</HI> and Mon&s;ieur the Prince advanc'd by the &s;ide of him in equal marches.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of <HI>June,</HI> the King left <HI>Nuys</HI> and be&s;ieg'd <HI>Or&s;oy,</HI> a little Town of a rea&s;onable &s;trength, &s;ituate on the left &s;ide of the <HI>Rhine.</HI> As &s;oon as His Maje&s;ty came before it, He caus'd it to be &s;ummon'd, but the Governor refu&s;ing to yield it up, we were immediatly employ'd about making of Faggots, and put|ing our &s;elves into a condition to attaque it.</P>
<P>The next day Mon&s;ieur the Prince came before <HI>Wezel,</HI> and did that day only encamp and inve&s;t the Town, which &s;eem'd &s;trong and con&s;iderable enough to make us pro|ceed cautiou&s;ly in our attaque. <HI>Wezel</HI> is a very great Town, &s;ituate on the right &s;ide of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> at the Mouth of the River <HI>Lyppe.</HI> It hath a great Ditch fac'd with good brick, and is divided in the middle by a great Trench, and very good Fortifications, &s;o that
<PB N="39" REF="21">if one half of the Town were gain'd, one &s;hould be put to the trouble of a Siege to get the other. Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> with whom we were, came before <HI>Burick,</HI> which we inve&s;ted; and after the Camp was &s;etled, he &s;ent for &s;ome Foot to rai&s;e a Redout between this Town and <HI>Wezel,</HI> which are over-again&s;t one the other, on each &s;ide the <HI>Rhine. Burick</HI> is two good Musket-&s;hot di|&s;tant from it, but not &s;o far, but that they might give one another mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance. For this rea&s;on it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to make this Redout, as well to hinder their communication, as to cut off the Pa&s;&s;age between <HI>Burick</HI> and the River, from whence the Enemy might have mi&s;chiev'd us in the Trenches, which we were about to begin on the other &s;ide, &s;o to make our approaches to <HI>Wezel.</HI> At the &s;ame time we were employ'd in rai&s;ing a Battery on the bank of the Ri|ver, to hinder the Dutch Ve&s;&s;els going to and fro upon the River, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Be|&s;ieg'd. At our fir&s;t coming thither we took two of them, which we mann'd with Dra|goons, and plac'd in the middle of the River. The Duke of <HI>Luxembourg,</HI> who command|ed the French Troops belonging to the Bi&s;hops of <HI>Colen</HI> and <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> be&s;ieg'd <HI>Lokem.</HI></P>
<PB N="40" REF="22">
<P>The &s;econd, the King commanded an A&s;|&s;ault to be given to <HI>Or&s;oy,</HI> whereupon we pre&s;ently made our &s;elves Ma&s;ters of the Counter&s;carpe, and gain'd all the out-works, which made the Governor de&s;ire to come to compo&s;ition; but no other Articles being of|fer'd, but, That the Garri&s;on &s;hould &s;urren|der them&s;elves upon di&s;cretion, He would not hear of that: &s;o the King &s;ent him back, threatning, That if they di&s;charg'd but one Canon more, He would have no mercy on them. But this hinder'd not their firing much more freely then they had don before, which greatly incens'd the King. Mon&s;ieur the Prince caus'd the Fort of <HI>Lippe</HI> to be at|taqued that Evening, which was carryed by the Count <HI>de Nogent</HI> by A&s;&s;ault. This very much terrified tho&s;e of <HI>Wezel,</HI> becau&s;e that Fort was near, and did in &s;ome manner com|mand the place. The Governor was there kill'd, with his Pike in his hand.</P>
<P>In Mon&s;ieur <HI>Turenne</HI>'s Army, they were all bu&s;ied in making their Lines of Circum|vallation, and blocking up the Town. The Battery, begun the day before upon the bank of the River, was fini&s;h'd, and nine pieces of Ordnance mounted on it. Mon&s;ieur the Prince rai&s;ed al&s;o another on his &s;ide of the River, con&s;i&s;ting of 6 Pieces; and in the E|vening we were bu&s;ied in repairing the Re|doute,
<PB N="41" REF="22">which had been almo&s;t beat down that day by the Guns of the two Towns.</P>
<P>The third, <HI>Or&s;oy</HI> yielded. For the Gover|nor &s;eeing him&s;elf unable to make any long|er re&s;i&s;tance, was fled with his Family, and all that was mo&s;t dear to him, in a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el, de&s;igning to gain <HI>Rhineberg;</HI> but His Maje&s;ty having intelligence of it, and being incens'd again&s;t him for his &s;tubbornne&s;s, caus'd the Canon to play &s;o hard upon him, that at la&s;t, &s;eeing one of his Wives Wo|men cut off in the middle by a Canon &s;hot, he was forc'd to come a&s;hore, and yield him|&s;elf up to the mercy of the Conquerors. The Plunder of the Ca&s;tle was given to the Soldiery, and the Garri&s;on made Pri&s;oners at di&s;cretion. The chief Per&s;ons whom we lo&s;t in the Action, were the <HI>Sieur de Valens,</HI> and the Chevalier <HI>D'Arquien,</HI> which la&s;t was kill'd by a Canon-&s;hot near the Kings Per|&s;on, who pre&s;ently afterwards commanded <HI>Rhineburg</HI> to be inve&s;ted. At the Prince's Army, the whole day was &s;pent in parlying, for the Inhabitants would by no means hear of &s;tanding it out; and the Garri&s;on, tho finding them&s;elves &s;o weak as not to be able to undertake any thing, could not re&s;olve to yield them&s;elves upon di&s;cretion, &s;o that the whole day pa&s;s'd without any Action. As for us who were before <HI>Burick,</HI> we pre|par'd
<PB N="42" REF="23">our &s;elves to attaque it &s;o vigorou&s;ly, as not be behind-hand with the other Ar|mies. We made Faggots, and in the After|noon carryed them almo&s;t as far as the Pal|li&s;ado's, not without the lo&s;s of &s;ome Troopers and their Hor&s;es, as well there as in our Camp, which lay level with the Canon of the Town. In the Evening, that part of the Regiment of the Kings Guards which was in our Army, and the Regiments of <HI>Burgundy</HI> and <HI>Artois,</HI> opened their Trenches. The Marquis <HI>de Ranes,</HI> with 150 Dragoons which he commanded, was to at|taque a Half-moon, and intending to make his way forwards, re&s;olved him&s;elf to be at the head of them. A like number were drawn out of the Regiments of <HI>Ca&s;telneau</HI> and <HI>Tu|renne,</HI> to do as much on the other &s;ide; which returning all &s;afe, could not properly be &s;aid to have gone upon the Forlorn. But ju&s;t as we were about to fall on, we heard a Trum|pet from the Town, and a&s;&s;oon as we had an|&s;wered it an Officer came forth, &amp; after him a &s;econd, &s;o that the Soldiers of the Guards, without &s;taying for the i&s;&s;ue of the de&s;ign'd Conference, began to cry, That they might leave off working at their Trenches, &s;eeing the Enemy yielded, and de&s;ired quar|ter. But the la&s;t Officer &s;eeming a little
<PB N="43" REF="23">more fierce and re&s;olute then the other, becau&s;e he had not a ready an&s;wer; we pre|pared to fall on immediatly if they did not yield without delay; which the Enemy per|ceiving, and having di&s;cover'd &s;ome Scaling-ladders ju&s;t ready to be made u&s;e of, they open'd their Gates, and the Regiment of Guards enter'd the Town ju&s;t about Mid|night, and fea&s;ted them&s;elves with the Pro|vi&s;ions which they found were bringing to the Soldiers that were upon Service in the Out-works. All the Garri&s;on were made Pri&s;oners at di&s;cretion.</P>
<P><HI>Burick</HI> is a rea&s;onable great Town, &s;ituate upon the left Bank of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> within two Mu&s;quet-&s;hot of the River, in a fine even fertile Soil. The &s;pace that is between it and the <HI>Rhine,</HI> is a great Mar&s;h, and deli|cate Fields and Meadows, which are nothing near &s;o boggy and wet, as the mo&s;t part of the re&s;t of <HI>Holland, Zeland</HI> and <HI>Frizeland.</HI> It lies over-again&s;t <HI>Wezel</HI> on the other &s;ide of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> which is a very fair great Town. <HI>Burick</HI> is none of the lea&s;t Towns which the Dutch have in the&s;e parts; its Fortifications are good, and it hath good Ba&s;tions and Half|moons, almo&s;t wholly of earth, but their Out|works are too big. The C. <HI>de Chamilly</HI> &s;peak|ing of this Town, &s;aid, It might well have held out 3 Months: From whence 'tis plain,
<PB N="44" REF="24">that in the confidence of its &s;trength the Hol|landers had been negligent: and not having taken care to keep their Fortifications in good repair, we found them laboring day and night in making Gabions for the top of the Ramparts; but they were &s;o &s;uddenly and briskly &s;et upon, that they could by no means perfect them. The &s;ame day we took two Barques upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and by that means we doubled the Guard we had plac'd in the middle of it. As &s;oon as <HI>Burick</HI> was yielded, M. <HI>de Turenne</HI> receiv'd a Pacquet from the King, upon which he immediatly ha&s;tned to wait on His Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>The fourth, nothing was done at the Kings Army, nor at Mon&s;ieur <HI>Turenne</HI>'s; but at the Princes they open'd Trenches before <HI>Wezel,</HI> which would not yield up to mercy. They were begun on the &s;ide of the Town that lies toward the River, and a Drain was made to empty the Ditch, which would have been done the night following, had not the Ene|my at la&s;t, &s;eeing his Highne&s;s re&s;olv'd to &s;et on then vigorou&s;ly, &s;ent the Keys of the Town, and yielded them&s;elves up to mercy. At the &s;ame time we were inform'd, that the Duke of <HI>Luxembourg</HI> had taken <HI>Lokem.</HI></P>
<P>The fifth, the Kings Army was bu&s;ied in making Faggots and Gabions for the attaqu|ing of <HI>Rhineberg.</HI> His Maje&s;ty &s;ent a Com|mand
<PB N="45" REF="24">to M. <HI>de Ranes</HI> to meet him there with the Regiment Royal of Dragoons, which was then with him before <HI>Burick,</HI> which he did. M. the Prince at 6 in the Morning en|tred <HI>Wezel,</HI> and vi&s;ited the Officers and Sol|diers of the Garri&s;on, where he &s;earch'd for French-men, and finding 10 or 11, had them hang'd. The Duke of <HI>Luxembourg</HI> turn'd off toward <HI>Grol,</HI> and M. <HI>Turenne</HI>'s Army re&s;ted. M. <HI>Cajax</HI> was made Governor of <HI>Or&s;oy.</HI></P>
<P>The fixth in the Morning, 10000 Faggots more were ordered to be made, which the Dragoons perform'd, but the Garri&s;on at <HI>Rhineberg</HI> finding them&s;elves too weak to re&s;i&s;t a Victorious Royal Army; and being likewi&s;e out of hope of receiving the Suc|cors were promi&s;ed them by the States, re|&s;olv'd to yield. The Officers of the Gar|ri&s;on came, and laying them&s;elves at his Feet, begg'd of him not to take ad|vantage to their co&s;t of the trick which the States had put upon them, in promi&s;ing them 2000 Men more as a reinforcement, which they had not perform'd. His Maje&s;ty con&s;i|dering the fal&s;hood of the States Promi&s;es, even to their own Soldiers, was mov'd to compa&s;&s;ionate their condition, and thereupon gave them leave to march out, Drums beat|ing, Colours flying, with Match lighted, and Bullet in mouth; which they did, and march'd
<PB N="46" REF="25">toward <HI>Mae&s;tricht,</HI> the King having given them a Convoy, and Provi&s;ion for four days. The Regiment of <HI>Guards</HI> entred the place about one of the Clock in the After|noon.</P>
<P><HI>Rhineberg</HI> is a pretty large Town, be|longing to the Archbi&s;hoprick of <HI>Colen,</HI> &s;i|tuate on the left &s;ide of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> in the mid&s;t of a very low Mar&s;hy Country, which contributes much to its &s;trength. The States had taken it again and again from the Spaniards, they having wrongfully took it from the Elector of <HI>Colen,</HI> who ever &s;ince hath been demanding it of them, and making complaints upon that account in every Diet; till at length the Spaniard propos'd to give it him back, on condition he might keep a Garri&s;on there: But this condition not plea|&s;ing the Elector, they at la&s;t promis'd, with|out any re&s;erve, to put it into his hands; but how in&s;tant &s;oever the Elector was with them, he could never per&s;wade them to be as good as their word: they had &s;o many &s;hifts, feig|ned excu&s;es, and pretences, that at la&s;t they proved the chief cau&s;e of the Electors de|claring War again&s;t them. Whil&s;t it was in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, they fortifyed it to their own minds; and being it was a Frontier Town, they had made it one of their &s;tronge&s;t Holds. The Fortifications are very regular;
<PB N="47" REF="25">there are good Ba&s;tions and Half-moons, good Ramparts, and very broad Ditches: but their Out-works are to big, as in mo&s;t of their Towns. All the Works are of Earth, which makes them the ea&s;ier to be a&s;&s;aulted, though it better re&s;i&s;t the Canon, which can only make a hole in them.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day &s;ome Foot were &s;ent o|ver the <HI>Rhine</HI> to plunder a certain Ca&s;tle there, but the Prince had &s;ent &s;ome others to the &s;ame purpo&s;e the day before; &s;o that tho&s;e who came la&s;t, did but lo&s;e their la|bor.

<P>The &s;eventh, Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> left the King, and &s;o did M. <HI>de Ranes,</HI> and the Regiment Royal of Dragoons. We went and joyn'd with the Army which was left before <HI>Burick,</HI> and having &s;ent all our hea|vie&s;t baggage to <HI>Rhineberg,</HI> where we left the new Companies of the Regiment of <HI>Turenne</HI> in garri&s;on, we went and encamp'd at <HI>Wor&s;temberg</HI> near <HI>Santein,</HI> in the Country of <HI>Cleve,</HI> which belongs to the Duke of <HI>Brandenbourg.</HI> M. the Prince left <HI>Wezel,</HI> and advanced likewi&s;e on his &s;ide.

But the Town which lyes on the other bank of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> was not &s;o civil, for their Canon did much harm to our Dragoons, e&s;pecially tho&s;e, who being come clo&s;e up, lay open to them. There were many of them lo&s;t, and more of their hor&s;es. But notwith&s;tanding the Capitulation went on at the Fort, which was but ill man'd, and becau&s;e the Gover|nor &s;tood upon terms, and would not deli|ver the place before he had &s;een and felt our Canon, M. <HI>de Turenne</HI> commanded the Foot to advance and begin the A&s;&s;ault, which they did without any re&s;i&s;tance from the Enemy (who had retired into a Redout which was very &s;trong.) Wherefore he caus'd a bridge of hurdles to be made, by which he pa&s;s'd over and enter'd the place him&s;elf, and commanded the Governor and his Gar|ri&s;on to be be&s;et, who at la&s;t yeilded. After|wards we turn'd the Canon of this Fort up|on the Town, and much &s;hot pa&s;t on both &s;ides. Many of the Enemies Guns were di&s;|mounted,
<PB N="49" REF="26">and the whole Town &s;o tired out that the next day they were forc'd to carry the Keys of their Gates to M. the Prince, who came up as we did, and made a &s;hew as if he would al&s;o have attaqued it, though his de&s;ign was to go &s;treight on to|wards a party of the Enemies which kept the Pa&s;&s;age of the I&s;le of <HI>Beter</HI> and of the <HI>Y&s;&s;el,</HI> that the King might go and be&s;iege that Town and <HI>Emerick.</HI> As &s;oon as the Fort had yeilded, Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> left there a part of his Hor&s;e, all his foot, the Artillery and Baggage; and upon no tice that 4000 of the Enemies Hor&s;e had pa&s;s'd the <HI>Wahal,</HI> with a de&s;ign, as 'twas thought, to &s;et upon us, we went to meet them. To that purpo&s;e we went and pa&s;s'd the River near <HI>Calcar,</HI> a little Town (in the Country of <HI>Cleve</HI>) defended by a Citadel, who&s;e fortifications are all of earth without any other facing. We were &s;aluted in our pa&s;&s;age by at lea&s;t 100 great Guns, and thence pa&s;s'd to <HI>Cleves,</HI> where our Army was victualled <HI>gratis.</HI> It is the capital City of the whole Province, but is a place of no defence. Afterwards we encamped a quarter of an hours riding from that City, by a park, which belongs to a Hou&s;e of plea&s;ure of the Duke of <HI>Brandebourg.</HI></P>
<P>The ninth was wholly &s;pent in pa&s;&s;ing the
<PB N="50" REF="27">Kings Army from the left to the right &s;ide of the <HI>Rhine.</HI> The town of <HI>Rees</HI> quite &s;pent and wearied out by our Canon from the Fort, brought in her Keys, and yeilded as the re&s;t had done.</P>
<P><HI>Rees</HI> is a fair great Town &s;ituate on the right &s;ide of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> 3 leagues below <HI>Bu|rick</HI> and <HI>Wezel,</HI> and 2 leagues above <HI>Emerick.</HI> It is &s;trengthned by a good Fort of its own name, &s;eparated from it only by the <HI>Rhine,</HI> who&s;e waters on the right &s;ide wa&s;h the walls of the Town, and on the left tho&s;e of the Fort. This Town is very great, her for|tifications very compleat and good. It hath good Ba&s;tions, Horn-works, Half-Moons well &s;trengthn'd with good Palli&s;&s;ados, large ditches, and covered ways, all very regular. In fine, when M. <HI>de Turenne</HI> enter'd the Fort, he told them that were near him, that their friends that knew <HI>Re&eacute;s,</HI> and heard they laid Siege to it, would certainly be very much concern'd for them: and thereupon having &s;ent for the &s;ieur <HI>Paul,</HI> a Flemming Engineer, to ask his opinion of it, he an&s;wered him, that if any body would have an excellent Model of a regular Fortification, they need not &s;eek it any where el&s;e, but might take it from <HI>Rees</HI> and its Fort; which is a Pen|tagone, who&s;e outworks were a little out of repair, but within there was a Redout
<PB N="51" REF="27">which they call the Ca&s;tle, which is very well and in good ca&s;e. It is &s;eparated from the Body of the Fort by a great flat broad ditch, which is deeper then it is broad, over which there is a little Draw-bridge, and a good Gate on the other &s;ide, and a high ram|part well palli&s;&s;ado'd and Gabioon'd, which at each corner hath two little Horn-works, which flank upon the bridge and ditch.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time M. the Prince advanced towards <HI>Emerick,</HI> which made no re&s;i&s;tance, the Dutch having withdrawn their Garri&s;on &s;ome days before.</P>
<P><HI>Emerick</HI> is a plea&s;ant town, &s;eated on the right &s;ide of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> a league above that place where the river divides, and makes the <HI>Rhine</HI> with its right branch, and the <HI>Wa|hal</HI> with its left. Tis a rea&s;onable good town, and its fortifications, that are all of earth, are well enough maintained. However the Dutch &s;ome few days before the Princes ar|rival, withdrew them&s;elves and quitted their Garri&s;on; either becau&s;e they thought it could not endure a Siege, or for &s;ome other rea&s;on, that I am ignorant of, &amp; cannot imagine what it &s;hould be; for &s;ince that time we have taken &s;everal Towns not &s;o &s;trong as that, where|in they had made very good Garri&s;ons.</P>
<P>That morning M. <HI>de Turenne</HI> with &s;ome Officers, and a &s;mall Guard, went to take a
<PB N="52" REF="28">view of <HI>Skinksconce,</HI> and came &s;o near as to be within hearing of the Garri&s;on: from whom we received about 40 musket, and &s;everal Canon &s;hot, but they did no execution. Thereupon, having learned the retreat of the enemy, we returned back, and joyned with the re&s;t of the Army, near the Fort of <HI>Re&eacute;s,</HI> in the mid way between <HI>Calcar,</HI> and another place called <HI>Hompel.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ame day M. the Prince advanced above <HI>Skinksconce,</HI> the <HI>Rhine</HI> lying between him and it, and di&s;covered the enemy on the other &s;ide, guarding that pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Dragoons of the <HI>Colonel</HI> Regiment were commanded to at|taque <HI>Demecum;</HI> but that place held out &s;o little a while, that they had time enough to come back, and &s;hare the Glory of that pa&s;|&s;age, that was made two days after.</P>
<P>The 10 his Maje&s;ty came to <HI>Re&eacute;s,</HI> we &s;tayed with M. <HI>de Turenne</HI>'s Army, where we received the news of the taking of <HI>Grol</HI> by the Bi&s;hop of Mun&s;ters Forces. That Town, if not the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t con&s;ide|rable that the Hollanders were ma&s;ters of, was yet of great con&s;equence to them, as lying on the Frontiers of Germany, and being excellently well &s;eated; on which ac|count twas fortified by <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth. It hath five Ba&s;tions, fair and good Ram|parts,
<PB N="53" REF="28">be&s;ides a great ditch, that cannot ea&s;ily be emtied, by rea&s;on of the river <HI>Sling,</HI> that di&s;charges it &s;elf into it.</P>
<P>The 11 his Maje&s;ty being advi&s;ed that M. the Prince intended to &s;wim the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and endeavour to force the enemy from the other &s;ide, though they appear'd to be con&s;idera|bly &s;trong, re&s;olved to be pre&s;ent in per&s;on at that Enterpri&s;e, which never had any equal, nor attended with like &s;ucce&s;s, and, as it were, dive&s;t him&s;elf for &s;ome time of his Title and Dignity, to &s;hare with his Soldiers, under the quality of a Feild-Mar&s;hal or private per&s;on, the honour of a day, that was almo&s;t to decide the fortune of all Holland.</P>
<P>To this intent he left his Army in their Quarters; and having taken with him his hou&s;e Guard, and 2000 loo&s;e hor&s;e, he incam|ped on the &s;ide of the River, on the right hand of <HI>Tolhuys,</HI> a &s;mall Fort about a league below <HI>Skinksconce</HI> in the I&s;le of <HI>Betaw.</HI> The enemy, that lay intrench'd on the other &s;ide, in number about three or four thou&s;and, gave fire, and skirmi&s;hed all that day. We on our &s;ide cau&s;ed &s;ome Foot to advance, whil&s;t we rai&s;ed a battery of five peices of Canon. In the mean time the Army of M. <HI>de Turenne</HI> approached to pa&s;s over the <HI>Rhine,</HI> over again&s;t <HI>Re&eacute;s,</HI> on a float of wood:
<PB N="54" REF="29">who after he had convayed over his Maje&s;ty, with his Army and the baggage to <HI>Wezel,</HI> came down to do the like with his own Army: but the water being low, and no great wind &s;tirring, they encamped at <HI>Nerdmorm|ter,</HI> and began not to pa&s;s till the evening: and &s;o the foot continued to pa&s;s all night, and afterwards the hor&s;e.</P>
<P>The 12 in the morning, his Maje&s;ty hav|ing expre&s;&s;ed he &s;hould be glad to have the pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Tolbuys</HI> &s;ounded, to try if it were not too deep before they ventured on it, M. the Count <HI>de Guiche</HI> went immediately, and &s;ounded it him&s;elf. Thereupon command was given to hor&s;e; and his Maje&s;ty, vext to &s;ee the enemy pretend a de&s;ire to engage, and not being able to endure tho&s;e out|ward &s;igns, that were &s;o contrary to their inclinations, without &s;taying to draw up, and not con&s;idering whether his Guards, <HI>Gendarmes,</HI> and light hor&s;e were pre&s;ent or no, who were to make the fir&s;t on&s;et, having found the <HI>Cuira&s;&s;iers</HI> near at hand, he commanded them to fling them|&s;elves into the water and cro&s;s the river; which they did &s;o briskly, that the poor M. the Marquis <HI>de la Salle,</HI> whom they hap|pened to meet in their way, received from them five or &s;ix dangerous wounds, as if he had been a Hollander (for indeed they
<PB N="55" REF="29">took him for one) though he was clothed after the French mode, and had a white &s;carf on. Mon&s;ieur the Count <HI>de Guiche</HI> was at the head of them, and did all that a good Captain and a brave Soldier could have done on the like occa&s;ion. The Forces of his Ma|je&s;ties hou&s;e were commanded to pa&s;s next, and to &s;wim the river; which they imme|diately did with &s;o much courage and re&s;o|lution, as &s;truck a terrour into the Enemy. They were followed by a great number of Volunteers; and immediately our Canon began to play, as al&s;o did that of the Ene|my. In the mean time General <HI>Wurts,</HI> Com|mander of the Troops that guarded the pa&s;|&s;age, being a &s;tout and well experienced Captain, marched at the head of the fir&s;t &s;quadron, and cau&s;ed them to advance into the water up to their Hor&s;es bellies, having given order to all the re&s;t to follow him in|to the river, &s;ome on the right, and &s;ome on the left hand. The fir&s;t &s;quadron advanced with re&s;olution, and made a brisk di&s;charge, at which M. the Count <HI>de Nogent,</HI> Feild-Mar&s;hal to that Army, a per&s;on of a brave and daring &s;pirit, received a wound in his head, which made him &s;ink into the water, where he was unfortunatly drown'd. But the following &s;quadrons that had orders to enter the river, not daring to run that hazard, &s;tayed
<PB N="56" REF="30">in the rear of the former, and by that means gave liberty to our men to pa&s;s, both on the right and the left wing, and at the &s;ame time to come upon them on the flank. In the mean time the Dragoons, being impa|tient al&s;o to cro&s;s the river, though having had no order they did not dare to do it, ad|vanced part of them into the water, that they might skirmi&s;h more commodiou&s;ly, and never cea&s;ed giving fire. At length the Dutch took the rout, and the Commander him&s;elf, that had enter'd &s;o briskly into the water, was forced to con&s;ult his own &s;afety by flight. For having comforted his men, and told them that no Nation but ours, was ca|pable of &s;uch bold enterpri&s;es, and that no|thing would be able to re&s;i&s;t us, tru&s;ted his life and his honour to his Hor&s;es feet, and at length made his e&s;cape, after he had fled a league or two, and &s;uffered a continual lo&s;s of his men in the pur&s;uit. During this time, the Generals and Mon&s;ieur the Prince him|&s;elf having pa&s;t the river, the Enemies Foot, that could not take the &s;ame cour&s;e that the Hor&s;e had done, and had nothing to hope for but death or mercy, began to mollify, and M. <HI>de Longueville</HI> with the Duke and other Volunteers were coming up to them. But M. the Prince ob&s;erving the Enemy to yeild, and fearing the youthfull
<PB N="57" REF="30">heat of the young Gentlemen would pro|duce &s;ome bad effect, run up, crying they would cau&s;e his &s;on to be killed: and having made all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;t, he came up to the trenches as &s;oon as the re&s;t, and cryed out to the Enemy they were all Rogues, and if they &s;hot once more, he would have them all hanged. His threats made them all lay down their arms, and cry out in their own Language <HI>Kartyr, Kartyr.</HI> But the misfor|tune was, that M. <HI>de Longueville,</HI> not taking notice of what had pa&s;t, and de&s;iring to free that Po&s;t, found a pa&s;&s;age too &s;oon; and falling upon the fir&s;t Officer that he met, kill'd him on the place: and upon the con|fu&s;ed noi&s;e he heard of <HI>Kartyr,</HI> which the Enemy demanded, he gave a &s;ign with his hand, and cryed, <HI>no Quarter,</HI> being imme|diatly followed by all his men that were then pre&s;ent. Thereupon the Enemy, de&s;pairing of their lives, betook them&s;elves again to their arms, and gave one &s;hot more, which proved a very fortunate one to them: for at it the <HI>&s;ieur de Longueville,</HI> M. <HI>de Guitry,</HI> Grand Ma&s;ter of the Kings Wardrobe, M. <HI>d'Aubu&s;&s;on,</HI> the Marquis <HI>de Ta&s;&s;e,</HI> nephew to Mon&s;ieur the Mar&s;hal <HI>de la Force,</HI> and the Count <HI>de Theobon</HI> were killed upon the place. Several others al&s;o were wounded, among&s;t which were M. the Duke <HI>de Coi&s;tin,</HI> and M.
<PB N="58" REF="31"><HI>de Vivonne,</HI> M. the Prince <HI>de Mar&s;illac,</HI> M. the Count <HI>de Saulx,</HI> the la&s;t in the face and the arm, after he had been ingaged in the general and a &s;ingle Combat: For having gone too far in the pur&s;uit of the Enemy, he found him&s;elf alone with one of their Officers, who put him&s;elf upon his guard, and wounded the Count in his face. M. <HI>de Brouilly</HI> dyed in a &s;hort time of his wounds, M. <HI>de Termes</HI> was al&s;o wounded, and M. the Count <HI>de Revel</HI> received a wound on his arm, and another of a musket &s;hot in his thigh. M. <HI>de Beringhen</HI> was &s;hot through the brea&s;t. The other per&s;ons of note that were wound|ed, were the Marquis <HI>de Beauveau, de Mont-revert, de Beaumont, de S. Arnoul,</HI> and which was wor&s;t of all, Mon&s;ieur the Prince had his left arm broke at the wri&s;t; which accident did much retard and le&s;&s;en his Maje&s;ties Conque&s;ts: for his name alone made the Enemy tremble, and they began not to make re&s;i&s;tance, till they had learnt the news of his mi&s;hap: con&s;idering too that from that time Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> was obliged to command in his place, and to join the Troops of his own Army with tho&s;e of the King: &s;o that of three Armies there remained now but two.

<P>The thirteenth, the Bridge of Boats, that had been making the day before, was fi|ni&s;hed; and the Army of M. the Prince be|gan at break of day to march over with M. <HI>de Turenne,</HI> who from that time com|manded alwaies in the place of his Highne&s;s. When they were all over they pillaged <HI>Tol|huys,</HI> a plain Ca&s;tle with one great Tower, guarded only by a ditch and a wall: but being &s;eated within a musket &s;hot of the river, near the pa&s;&s;age, a hundred loo&s;s hor&s;e, that had been drawn out of the Fort of <HI>Schain</HI> to &s;ecure that Ca&s;tle, had time enough to give two volleys of musket &s;hot, and di&s;|charge twice or thrice a peice of Canon that carried eighteen pound bullet charged with cartridges, before we could get over and come up to them: and afterwards they had the conveniency to retire before our coming, becau&s;e M. the Count <HI>de Guiche,</HI> who was the fir&s;t that pa&s;&s;ed, had bu&s;ied him&s;elf in
<PB N="60" REF="32">pur&s;uit of the hor&s;e, and M. the Prince of the foot, as was &s;aid before. We found in this Ca&s;tle &s;tore of fair and good Moveables, &s;ome per&s;ons al&s;o, that had retired thither in hope that we would not have attacqued Holland, about this I&s;le, but have pa&s;&s;ed directly on to <HI>Y&s;&s;el,</HI> where the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and the Count <HI>Maurice</HI> were both with their Armies.</P>
<P>After the pillage of this Ca&s;tle, Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> marched on clo&s;e after the Ene|my, a party of which he overtook, and found breaking a bridge, upon the Channel that runs from <HI>Arnhem</HI> to <HI>Nimegen,</HI> over which we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily pa&s;s.</P>
<P>The&s;e men, though but a &s;mall party, had a mind to fini&s;h their enterpri&s;e, perhaps becau&s;e they thought they might be &s;econd|ed with the re&s;t of the Army, that was not gone far; but having skirmi&s;h'd a little with the Vanguard, the Dragoons lighting of their hor&s;es, &s;et upon them &s;o vigourou&s;ly, that they gave them the rout, and forced them into <HI>Arnhem.</HI> And finding them&s;elves well enough at the end of a bridge that lyes over the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and reaches from this Town to the I&s;le of <HI>Betau,</HI> they lodged there, maugre the Canon and musket &s;hot of the Enemy, that fortunately killed more hor&s;es then men.</P>

<P>M. the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> natural Son to the King of England, arrived the &s;ame day at the Camp at <HI>Emerick,</HI> with 7000 foot, that were all brisk and active men.

<P>In the mean while, that no time might

The Dragoons, which were much incommoded by a guard of the Enemy placed in a redoubt on the other &s;ide of the river, were re&s;olved to ven|ture the pa&s;&s;age, which, after orders were given, they performed with &s;o much re&s;olu|tion and &s;ucce&s;s, as &s;truck a terrour into the Town; whereupon the Burghers began to mutiny, and at length forced the Garri&s;on to leave of firing.</P>
<P>The Fame of General <HI>Wurts</HI> defeat, and of our entrance into <HI>Betaw,</HI> was not long a &s;preading, and the noi&s;e of it no &s;ooner came to the ears of the Prince of Orange, who with his Army guarded the pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Y&s;&s;el,</HI> but the Enemy, being daunted with the news, thought of nothing but a retreat, which was done in &s;o great ha&s;t, as terrified all the places through which they pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>In the mean time M. <HI>de Turenne</HI> ordered 150 hor&s;e under the command of a Captain of the hor&s;e of <HI>Cond&eacute;,</HI> to &s;wim the river, and to fall on their rear Guard, that pa&s;&s;ed pretty near <HI>Arnham.</HI> The Enemy little expecting this attaque, as thinking them&s;elves &s;ecured

<P>Upon the Summons that M. <HI>de Turenne</HI> had given to <HI>Arnhem,</HI> the Citizens began to mutiny, and threatned the Garri&s;on to cut all their Throats if they fired any more; whereupon they came and demanded Arti|cles: but M. <HI>de Turenne</HI> &s;ent them to the King, and immediatly marched away with the greate&s;t part of his Army, to be&s;iege <HI>Knotzembourg,</HI> otherwi&s;e called the Fort of <HI>Nimigen,</HI> becau&s;e it is &s;eated on the right &s;ide of the <HI>Wahal,</HI> directly oppo&s;ite to that great Town, that lies on the left hand.

His Maje&s;ty early in the Morning parted with all His Army from <HI>Emerick,</HI> and encamped at <HI>Latem</HI> upon the River <HI>Y&s;&s;ell,</HI> or rather the Channel of <HI>Dru&s;us.</HI> A branch of this River that runs from <HI>Arnhem</HI> to <HI>Do|esburg,</HI> is a Channel that communicates be|tween the <HI>Rhine</HI> and the <HI>Y&s;&s;el,</HI> which was made by <HI>Dru&s;us</HI> in the time of the Romans, whence 'tis called the Channel of <HI>Dru&s;us,</HI> or the <HI>Dru&s;ian</HI> Ditch. In the mean time we advanced to <HI>Zevenaer,</HI> a &s;mall Town, that hath no other Fortification but its Ramparts,
<PB N="65" REF="34">&s;o that we made our &s;elves Ma&s;ters of it without any great difficulty. Pre&s;ently af|ter that, M. the Count <HI>de l' Orge,</HI> and M. the Marquis <HI>de Ranes,</HI> had command to pa&s;s the <HI>Y&s;&s;el;</HI> the one with 4000 Hor&s;e, and the o|ther with the <HI>Regiment Royal</HI> of Dragoons, to take the places that lie before <HI>Doesburg,</HI> which immediatly they did. But the De|puties of <HI>Arnhem</HI> having came to the King, and brought the Keys of their Town with|out Conditions, His Maje&s;ty in the After|noon gave order to the M. <HI>de Ranes</HI> to go with his Dragoons to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Town. M. the Marquis <HI>de Louvois</HI> went thither al&s;o; and the Inhabitants had granted them a freedom of their Religion, with all their Priviledges, but the Garri&s;on were made Pri&s;oners of War, and di&s;armed, to the number of 3000 Foot and 200 Hor&s;e, which were very &s;ufficient to have defended the place. The Dragoons were hardly ma|&s;ters of the Gates, when 200 Bores that came to the Garri&s;on with Provi&s;ion, de&s;ired entrance; whom we &s;uffered to come in, and afterwards made Pri&s;oners with the re&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Arnhem</HI> is a great Town, &s;eated on the right &s;ide of that Branch of the <HI>Rhine</HI> which keeps its name, and wa&s;hes the Walls of the Town. Its &s;ituation is partly high, partly
<PB N="66" REF="35">low, being commanded on that &s;ide that looks towards the <HI>Velue</HI> by a Hill, which to repair the Injury it doth it, &s;ends down a torrent of Water, that defends it on the other &s;ide by a great flat bottomed Ditch, all lined with Free-&s;tone, which is the faire&s;t and large&s;t that one &s;hall any where &s;ee, and which doth almo&s;t &s;urround the Town, except on that &s;ide where the <HI>Rhine</HI> wa&s;hes the Walls, and doth &s;ufficient|ly defend it. For the re&s;t, the Hollanders have taken care enough, and bin very dili|gent in fortifying it; and I may very well affirm, They have not very many Fortifica|tions &s;o good as the&s;e. They are all lined with Brick, which is not ordinary in their other Towns. The Ramparts al&s;o are very fair and large. To conclude, all things are very good, and it might be very well look'd upon as one of their be&s;t Towns.</P>
<P>At nine in the Evening, M. the Count <HI>de Guiche</HI> brought thither the Regiment of <HI>Na|var,</HI> and the Dragoons came back and en|camped on the &s;ide of the <HI>Y&s;&s;el.</HI> In the mean time M. <HI>de Turenne</HI> continued to &s;torm the Fort of <HI>Nimigen,</HI> which defended it &s;elf al|mo&s;t all day with equal force: but having fired al&s;o on the Boats, they were run a ground &s;o well, that the Enemy fearing lea&s;t in the night we &s;hould make our de&s;cent in|to
<PB N="67" REF="35">the Ditch, and &s;o enter the Town, they rendred them&s;elves up, after having killed 1000 or 1200 Men, of which the Sieur <HI>de la Pla&s;triere,</HI> Lieutenant Colonel of the Re|giment <HI>Lyonnois,</HI> and the Sieur <HI>Al&s;an</HI> the &s;on, Lieutenant of the <HI>Colonel</HI> of <HI>Champagne,</HI> were the principal. M. <HI>Magalotty</HI> Camp-Mar&s;hal, lo&s;t a Finger of one Hand, and was hurt in the other.</P>
<P>The 17. in the Morning, the Marquis <HI>de Ranes</HI> repa&s;s'd the <HI>Y&s;&s;el</HI> with his Dragoons, upon a Bridge of Boats which he made over it, and went and joyn'd with the Kings Ar|my, which by rea&s;on of a great maras was forced to turn back by the way of <HI>Zovenaer;</HI> and then pa&s;&s;ing by <HI>Dutecum</HI> went and be|&s;ieg'd <HI>Doesburg.</HI> M. the Prince removed to <HI>Arnhem,</HI> that he might not be far from the King. M. <HI>de Turenne,</HI> who came him&s;elf to acquaint the King with the taking of <HI>Knotzembourg,</HI> return'd immediatly, and caus'd us to march towards <HI>Skenks&s;conce,</HI> which &s;ince our pa&s;&s;age over the River had been block'd up. The Marquis of <HI>Sauvebeuf,</HI> who, as has been &s;aid, was hurt before <HI>Mae|&s;tricht</HI> the 24. of <HI>May,</HI> and there taken Pri|&s;oner, came back to the Camp cured of his Wounds, and without having paid any ran|&s;om, by the means of the generous C. <HI>Rhin|grave,</HI> who, together with the Spaniards in the
<PB N="68" REF="36">Garri&s;on (who&s;e Commanders had taken his part) had a conte&s;t with the States and Dutch party upon that account; for though the Dutch were willing enough to relea&s;e him, yet they were very eager for to have him pay his ran&s;om fir&s;t: But at la&s;t, after a great di&s;pute on both &s;ides, the Spa|niards threatned to for&s;ake the Town if they would not agree; which made the States con&s;ent to give him his liberty freely, toge|ther with a Pa&s;s to return to the Army.</P>
<P>The 18. The King &s;ummon'd <HI>Doesburg,</HI> but the Governor refu&s;ing to hearken to the Trumpeter, or receive the Letter he brought, His Naje&s;ty ordered preparations to be made to attaque it. Faggots and Gabions were commanded to be provided, which was done with all diligence. The Count <HI>de Lorge</HI> who lay on the other &s;ide of the River with 4000 Hor&s;e, advanced toward the Town, to hinder any Succors from being put into it that way. M. <HI>de Turenne</HI> cau&s;ed Trench|es to be open'd again&s;t <HI>Skenksconce,</HI> in which was a Garri&s;on of 1900 Men. The &s;ame day, about four of the clock, M. <HI>de Rochefort,</HI> Captain of a Company of the Life Guards, and Lieutenant General in this Campagne, who had receiv'd Orders to be ready to march with 4000 Hor&s;e, &s;et for|ward only with 1800, becau&s;e at &s;o &s;hort
<PB N="69" REF="36">warning the Victuallers had not had time to bake Bread enough for &s;o great a number. M. <HI>de Genlis</HI> was given him for his Camp-Mar&s;hal. The Marquis <HI>de Ranes</HI> &s;et forward likewi&s;e with the Regiment Royal of Dra|goons. We &s;wam our Hor&s;es over the <HI>Y&s;&s;el,</HI> and march'd on all the re&s;t of that day, and the night following, without drawing bit.</P>
<P>The 19. was &s;pent in preparations for o|pening of Trenches before <HI>Doesburg,</HI> in making Faggots, Gabions and Bridges for communication. M. <HI>de Turenne</HI> on his &s;ide &s;o vigorou&s;ly a&s;&s;aulted <HI>Skenksconce,</HI> that the Garri&s;on beginning to be di&s;heartned, and di&s;pairing of any &s;uccor, were thinking up|on capitulating; which M. <HI>de Turenne</HI> &s;u|&s;pecting, &s;ent the <HI>Colonel</HI> Regiment of Dra|goons to attaque the Fort of S. <HI>Andrew,</HI> which made no long re&s;i&s;tance, though there were in it 200 Men; and it be, I think, the be&s;t Fortre&s;s the Enemy hath. It lieth in the narrowe&s;t place of the I&s;le of <HI>Bommel,</HI> compa&s;t with five good Ba&s;tions, and water'd almo&s;t quite round by the River <HI>Wahal,</HI> &s;o that it is impo&s;&s;ible to drain its Ditches, and almo&s;t &s;o, to make any Bridge over them without the con&s;ent of the Be&s;ieged. M. <HI>de Rochefort,</HI> with whom as I &s;aid we &s;wam the <HI>Y&s;&s;el,</HI> and march'd all night, continued &s;till his march all this day, &s;o that we were al|mo&s;t

<P>At two of the clock in the Afternoon, as we came out of a very fine Village, which we found de&s;erted, our Van-guard di&s;cover|ed a Body of Foot; which a&s;&s;oon as we went about to pur&s;ue, &s;av'd them&s;elves in the neighboring Woods, which made us think they were only &s;ome Pea&s;ants, or &s;ome that had been laid in Ambu&s;h by Count <HI>Mau|rice,</HI> who&s;e Army we were in pur&s;uit of. At la&s;t we came to <HI>Amerfort,</HI> with de&s;ign to attaque and take it by a&s;&s;ault; but the In|habitants, who had ever &s;ince the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> his flight, kept &s;ome at the top of a Steeple to give them notice of our coming (that they might not fall into the Trap we had laid for them) and being advertized of our coming, came out before us, and obtain'd the free u&s;e of their Religion and pre&s;erva|tion of their Rights and Priviledges, open'd their Gates to the Marquis <HI>de Ranes,</HI> who entred the Town with the Regiment Royal of Dragoons which he had brought with him, and &s;taid there until the 27 of the &s;ame Month.

At his arrival, he made all the noi&s;e he could with Drums &amp; Trum|pets, beating and &s;ounding divers Marches, and afterwards &s;ummon'd the Town; which being terrified and &s;urprized, the Burgo|ma&s;ters of it came out to Treat, which they &s;pun out &s;o long, that the Garri&s;on had time to make their e&s;cape: And when they were all gone, they open'd their Gates and admit|ed him. As &s;oon as he was in the Town, he made enquiry to know if there was no Sol|diers in the place, and was told there was not; but con&s;idering that place to be of too much importance to be left without a Gar|ri&s;on by the Hollander, he caus'd one of the Burgoma&s;ters to be apprehended, and told him, They &s;hould all lo&s;e their Heads, for not di&s;covering to the King truly whether there were any Soldiers in the Town. The&s;e threats made them confe&s;s, That truly there had been &s;ome there, but as &s;oon as they heard the noi&s;e of the French Troops, they had fled towards <HI>Am&s;terdam;</HI> whereupon
<PB N="72" REF="38">he immediatly caus'd the Gates to be open'd, and went out in pur&s;uit of them; and at the &s;ame time order'd his Lieutenant, with &s;ome Hor&s;e, to follow the Enemies Hor&s;e, who were not yet out of &s;ight; and were &s;ome a Hor&s;e-back, and others on Foot, their Hor&s;es being laden with their Baggage. The Lieutenant pur&s;ued them to the Gates of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> got the greate&s;t part of their Baggage, and in his way homewards &s;um|mon'd <HI>Muyden,</HI> which not finding in ca&s;e to make any re&s;i&s;tance, he entered, and was ma&s;ter of it for 2 hours: but at la&s;t finding him&s;elf to weak to keep that place, he re|turned to fetch more Men; but in the mean time things put on another face. At the &s;ame time the Sieur <HI>de Mazelles</HI> on his &s;ide, had pur&s;ued the Foot, which took the way of the Fields and enclo&s;ures, and pa&s;&s;ing over 3 Bridges, &s;till broke them as &s;oon as they were got over, &s;o that he was forced to his Hor&s;es &s;trength to follow them. But the third time as he &s;wam, his Hor&s;e was mired, &s;o that taking only his Pi&s;tols, he left him there and follow&punc;d on, only accompanied with about 20 more of his Company, who making up to them upon the very mouths of their Muskets, at la&s;t took almo&s;t all the Soldiers, and two of their Captains Pri&s;on|ers.</P>

<P>The 20 the Kings Army open'd their Trenches before <HI>Doesburg:</HI> they wrought hard all night pretty freely and undi&s;turb'd|ly, under the command of the Duke of <HI>Roannez,</HI> at the head of four Batalions of the French Guards, defended by Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Rommecourt,</HI> who commanded the hor&s;e Guards; for the Enemy fired but very &s;pa|ringly. Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Rochefort</HI> left <HI>Amersfort</HI> in the morning, and with a party of hor&s;e march'd towards <HI>&V;trecht,</HI> and by the way heard that <HI>Naerden</HI> was taken, and that the Count <HI>Maurice</HI> was not far from it. M. <HI>de Rancs</HI> came back to <HI>Amersfort,</HI> and took with him 150 hor&s;e, 50 of which were Dragoons, and we march'd all night that way.

<P>The 21 the Garri&s;on of <HI>Doesburg,</HI> which the night before were as quiet as if they had been a &s;leep, began to be&s;tir them|&s;elves in the morning, and at break of day began to fire very furiou&s;ly: but this hinder'd us not from going on in our work happily enough, and with little lo&s;s, &s;o that the Bat|teries were made fit to play.</P>
<P><HI>Mon&s;ieur</HI> being come to <HI>Zutphen,</HI> &s;um|mon'd it, but they ab&s;olutely refus'd to yeild it up, which &s;o much the more incen&s;ed his Royal Highne&s;s, becau&s;e the day before they had &s;ent to propo&s;e the yeilding it.</P>
<P>The Marquis of <HI>Ranes</HI> arriv'd at <HI>Naerden</HI> about 2 of the clock in the morning, he rein|forc'd
<PB N="76" REF="40">the Garri&s;on with 50 Dragoons, be|&s;ides tho&s;e 100 which were there already, with the Company of the <HI>Sieur de Marelles,</HI> upon notice that Count <HI>Maurice</HI> was there|about with his Troops, and that he had put 2000 men into <HI>Muyden</HI> (which he had that day done &s;o &s;uddenly, that the Lieutenant, who had been ma&s;ter of it 2 houres, and went to fetch more men to put into it, when he came back, found the Enemy po&s;&s;e&s;t of it) and had now retrench'd him&s;elf on the other &s;ide of the &s;tream of <HI>We&s;ep.</HI> Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> at la&s;t made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of <HI>Skenksconce,</HI> and then turn'd his Arms to|wards <HI>Nimegen.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Skenksconce</HI> is a little hole (as I may &s;ay) &s;o famous that it were unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay any thing of it, but it is al&s;o of more than ordinary concern to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ours, becau&s;e of its &s;ituation, which is ju&s;t on the point of the I&s;land <HI>Betaw,</HI> ju&s;t where the <HI>Rhine</HI> divides it &s;elf into two great arms, whereof one retains its own name and runs towards <HI>Arnhem,</HI> and the other takes the name of <HI>Wahal,</HI> and leads to <HI>Nimegen.</HI> No Ve&s;&s;el can go up or down either River without their leave, who are Ma&s;ters of this Fort; &s;o that it is the Key which ei|ther opens or &s;huts up all communication between <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Germany.</HI> This makes
<PB N="77" REF="40">it of very great importance; for no Mer|chandize as Rheni&s;h Wine, Timber, and chiefly Firr-trees, which continually come down that way from <HI>Switzerland, Suaveland,</HI> and other places of <HI>Germany,</HI> and bring a great income both to tho&s;e who &s;end for them thence, and al&s;o to tho&s;e who &s;ell them again at &s;econd hand to other Nations, who come thither to buy them; &s;o that the trade both of the&s;e Commodities, and a hundred more, cannot go on without the leave of this Fort. And as its &s;ituation is mo&s;t ad|vantagious, &s;o is its &s;trength proportion|able, for on 2 &s;ides Nature hath &s;o &s;trength|en'd it with the defence of this great River, that it is not to be &s;et upon that way, and on the other, which is that that faces the I&s;le, Art hath fortified it with a great ditch full of water, good Ba&s;tions and half Moons, and a &s;trong Rampart, which make it in a manner impregnable. The In|habitants of the Country round about, who can &s;till remember former Wars, do a&s;&s;ure us it was always thought impregnable, and in Hi&s;tory we never find it ever was taken above twice, the fir&s;t time in the year 1636, when a certain Captain of a Garri&s;on in <HI>Guelderland</HI> for the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> call'd <HI>Enhoolt,</HI> being very much incens'd again&s;t the Hollanders, for putting divers of his
<PB N="78" REF="41">friends and kindred to death, took it by &s;urprize, &s;o that this can hardly be called a taking of it: the &s;econd time was after a Siege which will be remembred many ages to come, &s;ince it la&s;ted 8 months, and con|&s;um'd &s;o many men before it, that in many places it is yet known by the name of the French burying place, for they had then taken part with the Dutch, and did with their blood purcha&s;e there both Glory and Vi|ctory. It is likewi&s;e reported that when it was taken, there were left in it but 12 men, who did even then maintain the place.</P>
<P><HI>Deventer,</HI> at la&s;t being tired out by the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Mun&s;ters Granados,</HI> yeilded, and it's Garri&s;on march'd out with their arms towards <HI>Nimegen,</HI> with a Convoy, but &s;o weak a one, that when they came near <HI>Zut|phen,</HI> the Hollanders in &s;pight of the Convoy, ca&s;t them&s;elves into it, and this recruit it was which made the Governour change his mind, and deny to yeild up the Town to Mon&s;ieur, as he him&s;elf had propos'd the day before.</P>
<P>The Marquis <HI>de Ranes</HI> having vi&s;ited <HI>Naerden,</HI> and left good directions for the pre&s;ervation of that Place, departed thence about 6 of the clock for <HI>Amersfort,</HI> and left the Burgoma&s;ters of <HI>Muyden</HI> not a little confounded for having profer'd the Keys
<PB N="79" REF="41">of that Town, when it was no more in their power to let him into it, and even them &s;elves were &s;hut out of it.

<P>The 22 the <HI>Sieur Martinet</HI> Camp-Ma&s;ter to the Kings Regiment, appointed Governor of <HI>Emerick,</HI> and Camp-Mar&s;hal in this Cam|pagne, imagining that &s;ome per&s;ons did dayly watch him out of a &s;u&s;pition, that he had not &s;o much courage as he pretended to, did all that day and night run him&s;elf upon all dangers, and &s;o fortunately, that with|out receiving any wound, he advanc'd with his party much further among the Enemies Po&s;ts then could be expected; &s;o that by ill fortune the Count of <HI>Soi&s;&s;ons,</HI> who com|manded the I&s;le of <HI>Y&s;&s;el,</HI> and was order'd to &s;hoot cro&s;s way upon a Po&s;t of the Enemies, not being aware that the &s;aid <HI>Sieur Mar|tinet</HI> had already gain'd it, plaid upon it, &s;o that <HI>Martinet</HI> was kill'd by a Canon &s;hot; the &s;ame ill fortune took away the <HI>Sieur Sourry</HI> a Switzer Captain, and the <HI>Sieur Cy|ron,</HI> who was appointed Governour of <HI>S.

<PB N="80" REF="42">the Hollanders had taken &s;uch pains to for|tifie, and had 4500 men in it (who yeilded them&s;elves up to mercy) had co&s;t the King but one Swallow, one Mou&s;e, and one Worm, <HI>from the &s;ignification of the French names,</HI> for indeed the Place yeilded upon it.</P>
<P><HI>Doesburg</HI> is a Town which hath not been long famous, and indeed was at fir&s;t very incon&s;iderable, but &s;ince the Hollanders have found the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Y&s;&s;el</HI> to be &s;o ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the pre&s;ervation of their Country, they thought fit to fortifie all the Places that lye upon that River, and chiefly this which is &s;ituate ju&s;t where the Channel of <HI>Dru&s;us</HI> mingles its waters with tho&s;e of this river.

An hour before day, the be&s;ieg'd tried to give a fal&s;e Alarm, but it &s;ucceeded not as they hop'd: for the Cheva|lier <HI>de Lorraine,</HI> who had not &s;tirred from that Trench, di&s;covered their de&s;ign, and kept the Soldiers in due order. At 2 in the morning Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Rochefort,</HI> who had return'd to <HI>Amersfort,</HI> left it again to go with all his hor&s;e, as well tho&s;e who came the la&s;t night, as tho&s;e which were in the Town before, and encamp'd at the Gates of <HI>&V;trecht,</HI> between the Town and the Enemy. The Marquis <HI>de Ranes</HI> &s;tayed at <HI>Amersford</HI> with his Royal Regiment of Dragoons, and in the evening caus'd all things nece&s;&s;ary for an A&s;&s;ault to be carried upon the works, that they might be ready in ca&s;e of need. About nine in the morning the &s;ame day, the <HI>Sieur Hotain,</HI> a Colonel of the <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> Troops, who then commanded a flying Party, came before the Town, and &s;ummon'd it, but un|der&s;tanding
<PB N="83" REF="43">it was already po&s;&s;e&s;t, he com|manded his Army to make a halt, and gave order that 800 hor&s;e and 500 Dragoons, which he commanded, &s;hould refre&s;h them|&s;elves. Afterwards he de&s;ir'd he might come in and &s;alute the Governour; which he did, and breakfa&s;ted with him, he, and 3 or 4 more of his Company. He confirm'd the news of <HI>Deventer,</HI> and of the deaths of M. <HI>de Gerzey,</HI> and M. <HI>de Beaufort,</HI> Camp Ma&s;ter to a Regiment of hor&s;e, who in a &s;ally which the Enemy made, beat them back into the Town, but having engag'd him&s;elf beyond po&s;&s;ibility of retreating, receiv'd a great many wounds, of which he dyed on the place, as well as the <HI>&s;ieur Mallet,</HI> a Captain of hor&s;e in the &s;ame Regiment, and the <HI>&s;ieur Mauvoi|&s;iniere</HI> his Lieutenant. The &s;ame per&s;on af|firm'd he had newly made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of <HI>Elbairg</HI> and <HI>Harderwick,</HI> which are two little Towns above <HI>Campen,</HI> near <HI>Zuiderzee.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Waningen</HI> is a pretty Town about the big|ne&s;s of <HI>Meaux</HI> in <HI>Brie,</HI> &s;ituated in an un|even Country.

This town lying in the mid&s;t of many others, the States thought it unnece&s;&s;ary to fortifie, but left it in its ancient condition, &s;o that it hath hardly any Fortification be&s;ides its rampart.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day a Swi&s;s Drummer, who had been at <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> to carry news of &s;ome Pri&s;oners to their Relations, and to de&s;ire them to &s;end them money to pay their ran|&s;om, brought back word that he had been brought before Count <HI>Maurice,</HI> and mighti|ly que&s;tion'd by him: that his Army within their Retrenchments did not &s;eem to contain above 4000 men, that they &s;eem'd much di&s;|may'd, and that all the fiercene&s;s which he &s;trove to put on, could not hide his con|cern when he heard in what condition the Kings Army was, and that the Count had taken order to let him &s;ee as little as might be of the di&s;order and &s;lenderne&s;s of his Army.

<P>ALTHOUGH Men naturally love change, and novelties carry &s;till with them &s;omewhat of delight, yet there are &s;ome things that immediatly di&s;gu&s;t us, particularly tho&s;e that are forc'd upon us. As God at our Creation made us free, &s;o is there nothing more repugnant to our na|tures, then to be forced or con&s;train'd to any thing, or deprived of that lov'd liberty, to which we were born. This it was which made the Philo&s;ophers &s;ay, that nothing w^c^h is violent or forced could be of long con|tinuance, becau&s;e &s;uch things directly op|po&s;e our nature, who&s;e power cannot long be with&s;tood, it being nothing but the Will of God impre&s;s'd upon his Creatures.
<PB N="88" REF="46">We ought not then to think it &s;trange, that tho&s;e who have from their youth been brought up under one kind of Government, &s;hould find a great deal of difficulty in wean|ing them&s;elves from that, and accu&s;toming them&s;elves to live under another, &s;eeing it is natural to us &s;o to do, and the very irrational Creatures do as much by in&s;tinct: as we &s;ee every day in Hor&s;es, who if they have been us'd to the Saddle cannot without much difficulty be brought to draw; and Dogs that have been us'd to hunt, will not without much trouble be brought to couch when their game is in view. It is a common &s;aying that a Monkey will never leave his Api&s;h tricks, and that a Fox will ever love Gee&s;e to his la&s;t: and &s;o it is with Men, for tho&s;e who have liv'd under a Monarchical State, are very hardly brought to be contented with Democracy, and all men think that kind of Government be&s;t, under which they them|&s;elves have been brought up. So that, though the French yoake be much le&s;s greivous to the Subject then that which the States have laid on the People of Holland (among&s;t whom the very Servants pay Taxes out of their wages) yet we had great rea&s;on to watch very carefully over tho&s;e whom we had now lately conquer'd, upon the account of what we mention'd before, lea&s;t Nature
<PB N="89" REF="46">&s;hould prevail in them, as it u&s;ually doth in other Creatures. But good Fortune, which hath always attended the French Arms, and that peculiar ble&s;&s;ing which Heaven hath be&s;tow'd on our King, of being equally both fear'd and belov'd where ever he goes, had taken care to make our &s;u&s;picions groundle&s;s, by in&s;piring into the People of tho&s;e Countreys as &s;trong inclinations, and as much love towards his Maje&s;ty, as was to be found in the hearts of his mo&s;t Loyal French Subjects; and we did very remark|ably di&s;cover in many of them &s;o greedy and earne&s;t a de&s;ire of &s;eeing us, that in many places they were even afraid, lea&s;t we would not come and take their Towns; and I have been told they de&s;ir'd nothing &s;o much as to become his Maje&s;ties Subjects, and fear'd nothing more then not to be &s;o. The timely cour&s;e that all the Province of <HI>&V;trecht</HI> took, doth &s;ufficiently ju&s;tifie what I have &s;aid, and it is likewi&s;e certain that had not the States gone in good time to <HI>Am&s;ter|dam,</HI> the Inhabitants of that great Town were thinking of delivering us up the Keys: But tho&s;e blood &s;ucking Leeches, who&s;e power would by this means have come to no|thing, and who could no longer have fed up|on and enrich'd them&s;elves with the &s;poyles of the poor Subject, hinder'd their de&s;ign,
<PB N="90" REF="47">in&s;piring into them a fal&s;e and imaginary kind of courage, which they took from de|&s;pair, and by which they let them&s;elves be mi&s;led, never thinking of that happine&s;s and quiet which their neighbours did now en|joy under the French Government, and how much they were pleas'd with the change. Their rejoycing at it did vi&s;ibly appear, when they fir&s;t heard the news of the birth of the Duke of <HI>Anjou,</HI> which every body with one voice did congratulate; and for Joy Bon|fires were made in all places, every body &s;triving who &s;hould with mo&s;t zeal &s;hew his re&s;entment of &s;o welcome news. But it will not perhaps be impertinent here to inform the Reader how that this kind of Ceremony is by them perform'd in a much different way from what we do on the like occa&s;ions in France: for whereas we do generally a&s;|&s;emble our &s;elves together to &s;ome Public place, where a great Fire is made on the Public charge, no man contributing any thing more to it then he needs mu&s;t, though he defire never &s;o much to be thought a good Subject; with them on the contrary, every Hou&s;e-keeper makes a fire before his door, and the greater the fire it is the &s;ign of the greater zeal; neither do they make their fires by piling of wood up, but fixing a &s;take, at the top of which they fa&s;ten pitch barrels and
<PB N="91" REF="47">&s;uch like combu&s;tible matter, which being lighted, they make merry and &s;ing about it in the &s;ame manner as we do.</P>

<P>The &s;ame day Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Turenne,</HI> came and din'd with the King, and inform'd him of the ob&s;tinacy of the Garri&s;on and Inha|bitants of <HI>Nimegen;</HI> afterwards he return'd back to give &s;uch further orders as &s;hould be found nece&s;&s;ary.</P>

<P>At la&s;t <HI>Zutphen</HI> was reduced to that con|dition, that the be&s;ieg'd began to beat a Parley betimes in the morning, and de&s;ir'd to capitulate. The Articles of Capitulation at all the places which have been won from the Hollander were in general the &s;ame, and therefore here as in other Places the Gar|ri&s;on was made pri&s;oners, and the place yeilded up without any other conditions. The Chevalier <HI>de Lorraine</HI> went to receive their Ho&s;tages, which were a Burgoma&s;ter and two of the Officers of the Garri&s;on, whom he brought to his Royal Highne&s;s; who granted the Inhabitants as well here as in other places liberty of Con&s;cience, and their Priviledges, and pre&s;ently gave notice of the bu&s;ine&s;s to his Maje&s;ty: acquainting Him withall, that the number of his Pri|&s;oners was increas'd by 3000 foot and 250 hor&s;e, be&s;ides the Governor. I cannot but take this opportunity of doing Ju&s;tice to <HI>Mon&s;ieur,</HI> in letting the World know that in this Siege he perform'd all that could be done by an expert General, and a valiant Soldier; he was very circum&s;pect and watch|full, look'd after every thing him&s;elf, and was always where there was the hotte&s;t &s;ervice, going with an undaunted courage to the mo&s;t dangerous place in all the Trenches, where many were kill'd round

However this accident did not a little fright all men, e&s;pecially the great ones, who now began to contrive how they might make an e&s;cape out of the Town, and were preparing to do it with all their Goods of value: but the multitude openly with&s;tood their de&s;ign, not &s;uffering

<P>In the mean time the States at <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> were not a little di&s;quieted; they &s;at in Council every day, and could not any way be &s;atisfied, till they had di&s;patch'd the Sieur <HI>Grotius</HI> back to the King in all ha&s;t, with new Orders, and a more ample and unlimit|ed Commi&s;&s;ion.

There are many plea&s;ant Hou&s;es &s;catter'd about, and the Suburbs are large and convenient; about which lie many rich Meadows and Pa&s;ture Grounds (&s;tock'd with abundance of all &s;orts of Cattel) as far as one can &s;ee every way. Becau&s;e the Burgoma&s;ters, when they came to yield up their Town, had de&s;ir'd to have no Garri&s;on forc'd upon them, promi&s;ing to defend the place them|&s;elves for his Maje&s;ty; and being they &s;taid not till they were &s;ummon'd, but of their own accord had yielded up the place, it was re&s;olv'd they &s;hould be thereupon con&s;ider'd and kindly u&s;ed. And that they might have no rea&s;on to complain, M. <HI>de Roannez</HI> pitch'd his Tents upon the Rampart, where he &s;till continu'd, as did likewi&s;e the re&s;t of the Of|ficers and Guards after his example. The
<PB N="100" REF="52">Mu&s;queteers, who had kept the place ever &s;ince the Surrender, retir'd and encamp'd without <HI>St. Catharin</HI>'s Gate, with the Mar|quis de <HI>Rochefort</HI>'s Army, upon the Bank of the River that runs hence to <HI>Rotterdam.</HI> The two Companies of Life-Guards enter'd the Town, and di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves into divers quarters of it, where they lay upon the Guard; and afterwards the Hor&s;e-Guards belonging to the <HI>Kings Hou&s;hold</HI> mounted the Guard by turns, relieving one another every Morning at &s;ix of the Clock.</P>
<P>The news of Count <HI>Maurice</HI>'s retiring &s;till farther, was confirm'd to us, and that he had al&s;o broken down mo&s;t of the Banks that kept out the Sea, having left only one which lay inwardmo&s;t &s;tanding; and that thereabouts he made Intrenchments, which he very carefully guarded, and fortified with divers pieces of Ordnance.</P>
<P><HI>Groot</HI> (or <HI>Grotius</HI>) in his pa&s;&s;age, told M. <HI>de la Fueillade,</HI> That he had a Blank to pre|&s;ent to the King if he would treat, and &s;o unlimited a Power granted him, as the States had never before given to any Pleni|potentiary.</P>
<P>The 29. the King leaving <HI>Amerongen,</HI> went and encamped at <HI>Zei&s;t</HI> and <HI>Stotwegen,</HI> where <HI>Grotius</HI> had Audience, and made his Propo&s;als for a Peace, but without &s;ucce&s;s;

The Marquis <HI>de Ranes</HI> drew out 70 Dragoons of the Regi|ment <HI>Royal,</HI> to &s;trengthen the Garri&s;ons at <HI>Montfort</HI> and <HI>I&s;&s;el&s;teing,</HI> and march'd with them him&s;elf to vi&s;it tho&s;e places, and give &s;uch Orders as he &s;hould find nece&s;&s;ary for the defence of them. The Count <HI>de la Mark</HI> was left &s;ick at <HI>&V;trecht.</HI></P>
<P>The 30. Nothing extraordinary was done at the Kings Camp which lay at <HI>Zei&s;t</HI> and <HI>Stotewegen.</HI> M. <HI>de Turenne</HI> proceeded on in his approaches before <HI>Nimegen,</HI> where the be|&s;ieged &s;till defended them&s;elves very vigo|rou&s;ly. The Marquis <HI>de Rochefort</HI> went out betimes to view and take notice what Forces lay upon the River that goes from <HI>&V;trecht</HI> to <HI>Am&s;terdam.</HI> After Dinner <HI>Grotius</HI> re|turn'd to <HI>&V;trecht,</HI> and thence to <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> to acquaint the States with the Kings plea|&s;ure as it related to a Treaty of Peace, which was now diver&s;ly talked of.</P>

<P>The fir&s;t of <HI>July</HI> His Maje&s;ty lay &s;till, and re&s;ted where he did before, and &s;o continued until the 10^t^h. The Marquis <HI>de Louvois,</HI> and of <HI>Pouange,</HI> came to <HI>&V;trecht</HI> after dinner. The King in Per&s;on review'd his whole Army very &s;trictly, and then i&s;&s;ued out &s;evere Pro|hibitions to hinder any of his Army's wan|dering from their own Colours, upon pain of certain death without mercy; &s;o that whoever &s;hould offend, they &s;hould all be hang'd, and not hope that any &s;hould be put to the Lot for their Lives; with command likewi&s;e to all Officers, That they &s;hould bring in every Night to the Commander of each Body, the names of all &s;uch as had been ab&s;ent from their Companies.</P>
<P>It was now reported, That a pail of fre&s;h Water was worth 12 Stivers at <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> which are equal to 15 French Sols.</P>
<P>The &s;econd of <HI>July,</HI> the Cardinal of <HI>Bou|illon</HI> came to <HI>&V;trecht,</HI> where he was almo&s;t crowded to pieces by Roman Catho|licks, who followed after him as an Angel &s;ent from Heaven, praying him with much earne&s;tne&s;s, to Ble&s;s and Con&s;ecrate the Churches of the Town. The Archbi&s;hop of the place him&s;elf de&s;ir'd it of him with much importunity, in the name of all the People; but he de&s;ir'd to be excu&s;ed, till he &s;hould have order to do it from the King.
<PB N="103" REF="53">The Marquis <HI>de Ranes,</HI> and the Chevalier <HI>de Bouflers,</HI> Camp-ma&s;ter to the Regiment Royal of Dragoons, going over from <HI>&V;|trecht</HI> to His Maje&s;ties Camp, which lay but two Leagues di&s;tant, were ordered to &s;end two Companies of the &s;aid Regiment to the Count <HI>de Lorge,</HI> who was about four Leagues thence, drawing towards <HI>Arnhem</HI> with a fly|ing Squadron, which made M. <HI>de Bouflers</HI> re|turn po&s;t to <HI>&V;trecht,</HI> from whence he &s;ent two Companies, that of <HI>de la Faye,</HI> and that of <HI>de la Rouillardiere.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mon&s;ieur,</HI> who 2 or 3 days before had joyn'd with the Kings Army, after the taking of <HI>Zu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">phen</HI> went to <HI>&V;trecht,</HI> where he din'd with the Chevalier <HI>de Lorraine,</HI> who treated him very &s;plendidly.</P>
<P>The night following there chanced to be a Fire in the Town, which burnt down two Hou&s;es; and we were told, That one of the 36 Burgoma&s;ters of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> who had been one of the 3 that had been again&s;t the giving up the Town to the King, when the Inhabitants would not re&s;olve to acknow|ledge the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> as the mo&s;t part of the re&s;t had done, we heard, I &s;ay, that this Burgoma&s;ter had received a Musket|&s;hot from a Sentinel, for not an&s;wering in time, when he was asked, Who goes there? and that he was in great danger of death by
<PB N="104" REF="54">it. And that the Sea finding no oppo&s;ition, &s;ince the Count <HI>Maurice</HI>'s cutting down the Banks, did come into the Country with a dreadful impetuo&s;ity, and had already over|whelmed a great part of the Country which lay between us and <HI>Am&s;terdam.</HI></P>
<P>The Count <HI>de Chamilly,</HI> whom M. <HI>de Tu|renne</HI> had ordered to march towards <HI>Gennep</HI> and <HI>Grave,</HI> and make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of them, arrived before <HI>Gennep,</HI> thinking the Inhabi|tants, whom the Dutch Garri&s;on had for|&s;aken, would without difficulty have yield|ed it up, but found not what he expected: for a Colonel belonging to the <HI>Brandenbur|ger,</HI> being ordered to put &s;ome Forces into it, and keep it as belonging to the Elector his Ma&s;ter, having performed his Orders, re|fu&s;ed to give it up to Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Chamilly.</HI> The truth is, this little Town, which is not extraordinarily &s;trong, and lies upon the <HI>Meu&s;e</HI> between <HI>Ruremonde</HI> and <HI>Grave,</HI> had formerly belong'd to the Duke of <HI>Branden|bourg;</HI> but having been taken from him, and long po&s;&s;e&s;t by the Hollander, it was now no more reckoned to be his. Wherefore M. <HI>de Chamilly</HI> re&s;olving not to be put off, &s;ent him word, That unle&s;s he would be gon and leave the place to him, he would cer|tainly put all his Men to the Sword, and hang
<PB N="105" REF="54">him without mercy. But the Colonel being not mov'd at this Threat, the Count <HI>de Cha|milly</HI> made his Troops immediatly prepare to a&s;&s;ault the place; but then the Colonel &s;earing a di&s;mal Halter, which he fore&s;aw would be his fate if he &s;tood out any longer, &s;ent us word, That rather then di&s;grace his Family with being hang'd, he would con|&s;ent to any thing to avoid &s;uch an ignomini|ous death; wherefore, he de&s;ired to be u&s;ed as an Officer of the Duke of <HI>Brandenbourgs,</HI> who having not as yet declared him&s;elf, ought not to be reckon'd nor u&s;ed as an Ene|my; he therefore de&s;ired, he might freely march off and return to the place from whence he came; and earne&s;tly entreated M. <HI>de Chamilly,</HI> that lea&s;t he &s;hould be hang'd at his return for not maintaining the place, he would give him an Certificate under his Hand, that he was ready to give an A&s;&s;ault to the place, and had threatned to hang him before he yielded it up; which having been granted him, he retir'd into the next Garri&s;on, as well &s;atisfied as if he had gained &s;ome great Victory, or done &s;ome memorable exploit. So that the Count <HI>Cha|milly</HI> pre&s;ently ordered his Men to enter the place; and then marched towards <HI>Grave,</HI> who&s;e Garri&s;on was retir'd, and which was
<PB N="106" REF="55">now in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Sieur <HI>Cleodore,</HI> who by order from M. <HI>de Turenne,</HI> kept the place with 40 or 50 <HI>Mai&s;tres.</HI></P>
<P>The third, the Marquis <HI>de Louvoys</HI> went and vi&s;ited the Town-hou&s;e of <HI>&V;trecht,</HI> and commanding the Maps of the Country to be brought him, informed him&s;elf of the number, bigne&s;s, and other qualities of the Channels which compa&s;s'd the Prince of <HI>O|range</HI>'s Camp; that being before-hand in|&s;tructed in the&s;e matters, he might be ready to go and attaque him in ca&s;e a Peace were not concluded. It mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, that the prudence and conduct of the Marquis <HI>de Louvois</HI> are almo&s;t incredible; he hath manag'd things in this Campagne, as he doth all things el&s;e, with marvelous vigilancy, care and &s;ucce&s;s. The Kings Troops, the care of which lay wholly upon him, were the be&s;t order'd that might be; nothing was wanting in the Army: he had taken &s;uch care for all things nece&s;&s;ary, that the King need|ed only wi&s;h that things &s;hould be done, and they were &s;o. He found in that Man an inexhau&s;tible Trea&s;ure of all tho&s;e good Qualities which fit a Man for ordering bu|&s;ine&s;s dextrou&s;ly; he had e&s;tabli&s;h'd &s;uch good Orders, and &s;uch a way of living a|mong the Soldiers, that they found them|&s;elves as well accommodated as if they had
<PB N="107" REF="55">been in <HI>Paris,</HI> and that without any way being grievous to the Countrys where they lay. There were every where continual Fairs and Markets, to which Merchants, Vi|ctualers, and Country people re&s;orted, with as much &s;ecurity as to St. <HI>Laurence</HI>'s Fair. In a word, he &s;o well contriv'd all things, that we never wanted any thing.</P>
<P>After Dinner the King came to the Camp, and having walked about it and view'd his Troops, without cau&s;ing them to take Hor&s;e; he al&s;o rounded the out-&s;ide of the Town, and then went into it likewi&s;e, but <HI>incognito.</HI> Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> continu'd &s;till battering <HI>Nimegen,</HI> which did &s;till couragiou&s;ly de|fend it &s;elf. Notwith&s;tanding, he di&s;patch'd a Courier to the King, to tell Him, he hop'd that very day to &s;pring a Mine, or that at farthe&s;t it would be &s;prung the next day. The Sieur <HI>de Carman,</HI> Lieutenant Colonel of the <HI>Champagne</HI> Regiment, was killed before this place.</P>
<P>The Count <HI>de Lorge</HI> made his Men labor hard all day about making a Bridge over the <HI>Rhine,</HI> that by it he might get into the <HI>Betaw.</HI> The News of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s being cho&s;en Statholder, and Protector of their Country, by all the Towns of the United Provinces, except only <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> was con|firm'd to us, and at the &s;ame time the Sieur
<PB N="108" REF="56"><HI>Groot,</HI> who was this day to return and bring the King an an&s;wer about the ratification of the Peace, in&s;tead of coming him&s;elf, &s;ent to de&s;ire, That his time might be prolong'd two days more, which were accordingly granted him. It is to be noted, That His Maje|&s;ty would treat with him not as coming from the States (who&s;e Authority he would not acknowledge) but only as from the Peo|ple of Holland.</P>
<P>The fourth, nothing extraordinary hap|ned in the Kings Army, which continued re&s;t|ing and refre&s;hing it &s;elf after all the hard|&s;hip it had undergon. M. <HI>de Turenne,</HI> after having had his de&s;ign of mining <HI>Ni|megen</HI> twice fru&s;trated by Countermines, at length, notwith&s;tanding all the Enemies care and pains to hinder it, almo&s;t fini&s;h'd one; &s;o that they finding they &s;hould ere long have a breach made in their Walls, and be forced to endure an a&s;&s;ault, and come to handy|blows with the French (which they feared above all things, as knowing how good our Nation is at that kinde of Service, and how dangerous it is to fall into their hands) re|&s;olv'd at la&s;t to come to a Compo&s;ition. The Count <HI>de Saulx</HI> had a piece of his Breeches &s;hot off, and one of his Servants kill'd with him by a great &s;hot before this place, which gave occa&s;ion to the &s;preading of a rumor,
<PB N="109" REF="56">that he was dead, and made him as much lamented in the Kings Army, as if he really had been &s;o.</P>
<P>The fifth, at break of day, 2 Hor&s;e-men from <HI>Naerden</HI> came to Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Rochfort,</HI> to give him notice of the Count <HI>Maurice</HI>'s la&s;t retreat, and how he had cut down the Banks and let in the <HI>Zuiderzee,</HI> who&s;e far|ther cour&s;e was now &s;topp'd by nothing but only one Dike, which was only broad enough for 3 Hor&s;e to march abrea&s;t on. At the &s;ame time M. <HI>de Rochfort</HI> di&s;patch'd a Cou|rier to the Marquis <HI>de Louvois</HI> to give him notice of it, and M. <HI>de Roannes</HI> drew out a party of the <HI>Life Guards,</HI> which were of the Guard at <HI>&V;trecht,</HI> and &s;ome of the Kings Men at Arms, who were come thither, &amp; &s;ent them under the Command of the M. <HI>d'Am|bre,</HI> to view and take cognizance of the Po&s;t which the Enemy now po&s;&s;e&s;t. They did ac|cordingly, and &s;tood within Pi&s;tol-&s;hot of their Intrenchments two long hours, none of the Enemies in the mean time daring to come out towards them; only they were free of their Musket-&s;hot, which yet did no harm, &s;o that our Men came back ju&s;t as they went: which is an infallible token of the Dutch cowardize, who dar'd not &s;tir out when they might have cut the whole Party to pieces: and though they had fear'd &s;ome
<PB N="110" REF="57">ambu&s;h, yet might they have come round in their Barks, and &s;et on them behind with|out any danger of being any way &s;urpriz'd, being &s;ure of a &s;afe retreat when ever they de&s;ir'd it. Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> at length be|came ma&s;ter of <HI>Nimegen,</HI> which yielded up|on the &s;ame terms as others had done, only the Governor and other chief Officers had li|berty to depart with all their Baggage.</P>
<P><HI>Nimegen</HI> is a very great Town, and full of Inhabitants, &s;ituate on the left &s;ide of the <HI>Wahal,</HI> which runs by its Walls, and &s;epa|rates it from the Fort of <HI>Knotzembourg;</HI> it lies high on one &s;ide, and low on the other. On the higher part of the Town &s;tands an old Ca&s;tle, which is &s;till &s;trong enough, and commands both the Town and River. The lower part is plentifully furni&s;h'd with Tow|ers, Ba&s;tions, and Half-moons of an exce&s;|&s;ive bigne&s;s, and upon that account they need more Men to defend it then we do in our Towns, who are more concern'd to have them well lined and flanck'd. Tho&s;e who have Travell'd in Holland, may have ob|&s;erv'd the prodigious dimen&s;ions of all parts of their Fortifications, &s;o that each Work requires as many Men almo&s;t to defend it, as a whole Town of ours.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Count <HI>de Chamilly,</HI> who was march'd towards <HI>Grave,</HI> found
<PB N="111" REF="57">&s;trange alterations there, as well as he had at <HI>Gennep.</HI> Some of the States, either tho&s;e that were at <HI>Mae&s;tricht,</HI> or others, hearing that their Garri&s;on had &s;o cau&s;ele&s;ly quitted the Town, which is very &s;trong, and who&s;e Works are in very good repair; and know|ing withal that there were not in it above 40 or 50 of our Men, &s;ent a command to the Governor that had quitted it, to return thither and defend it upon pain of death; and ordered the Governor of the <HI>Bu&s;&s;e</HI> to give him all po&s;&s;ible a&s;&s;i&s;tance in ca&s;e of need. Wherefore, upon this Order he was forc'd to turn back again, and the Governor of the <HI>Bu&s;s</HI> took with him 33 Companies of Foot, and 100 Hor&s;e, to go and perform what was commanded him. There being as yet no Garri&s;on put into the place, and the Town&s;men refu&s;ing to keep the Gates, it was ea&s;ie for him who came before in ha&s;t with 100 <HI>Mai&s;tres</HI> to enter the Town, whil'&s;t the Foot followed &s;oftly after; though as it prov'd, they made too much ha&s;t to their own misfortune. He therefore vi&s;its the place, and reckons upon tho&s;e Men of ours which he found there, as &s;o many Pri&s;oners. But whil&s;t this was doing, the Van of the Count <HI>de Chamilly</HI>'s Army was di&s;cover'd, and he withal gave notice of his coming, which was but ill news for the new Con|queror,
<PB N="112" REF="58">who by this means was not like to wear his Laurel long. Hereupon the Town&s;|men began to change their note, and declar'd they would not &s;uffer them&s;elves to be plun|dered by us, and therefore bid the Gover|nor &s;hift for him&s;elf, which he could no o|therwi&s;e do, then by &s;ending to de&s;ire a Pa&s;s from M. <HI>Chamilly,</HI> that he might come and capitulate with him, which he did, and was &s;uffer'd to return again to the <HI>Bu&s;&s;e</HI> with his 100 Hor&s;e; he mentioned not the Foot in the capitulation, which he thought was &s;o far behind, that he might ea&s;ily give them notice to retire homewards and none of us the wi&s;er. But to their misfortune he was out in his calculation, for M. <HI>de Joyeu&s;e</HI> met with them, who though he had then with him but a &s;mall party of the Brigade of Hor&s;e which he commands (the re&s;t being gone before under command of the Marquis <HI>de Tury,</HI> to recover the Town) he fell upon them &s;o fu|riou&s;ly, that they had only time to make one di&s;charge at us. In this Encounter mo&s;t of the Enemy were kill'd, and the re&s;t taken, &s;o that there hardly e&s;cap'd one to carry home the bad news: we got at this bout 33 Colours.</P>
<P>The night that follow'd, and the &s;ixth day, there hapned a Fire in the Kings Quarters, which began in the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s
<PB N="113" REF="58">Hou&s;e, and burnt down together with &s;ome others; the damage the Duke had by it was computed to amount to 100000 Crowns. The fire reached the Kings Stable, and de|&s;troyed many Hor&s;es and their harne&s;s, and at la&s;t grew &s;o dreadful, that the King was forced to ri&s;e, lea&s;t the fire &s;hould al&s;o come to his Appartment; many of his Pages having had their cloths burnt.</P>
<P>We heard of the ill &s;ucce&s;s of Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Nancrud</HI>'s attempt upon <HI>Ardemburg,</HI> which had faild by his guides and &s;pies &s;aults, the&s;e having mi&s;inform'd, and the other mi&s;led him. The Particulars of that bu&s;ine&s;s were as follows; Word was brought to him that the Garri&s;on was both very &s;mall and al&s;o negligent, which made him re&s;olve to try if he could &s;urprize it; and to that purpo&s;e he order'd his march &s;o as to ar|rive before the Place at midnight, with a de&s;ign to attaque it in four &s;everal places at once, but it &s;o happen'd, his Guides either not being &s;ufficiently acquainted with the Country, or mi&s;taking their way in the dark, that his whole party met at the &s;ame place, and &s;o were for|c'd to make their attaque all on one &s;ide of the Town; which being perform'd very couragiou&s;ly, they beat out the Enemy and gained a half Moon, which Po&s;t de&s;ign|ing
<PB N="114" REF="59">greater things they cared not to &s;ecure from the Enemy's &s;hot; but day at la&s;t be|gining to break, the Enemy who had re|ceiv'd &s;upplies from <HI>Sluice,</HI> now made more vigorous re&s;i&s;tance; and having di&s;cover'd our men, who lay leuel and open to their &s;hot, kill'd many of them, &s;o that they were forc'd to retire with lo&s;s of 1000 or 1200 men.</P>
<P>The Marquis <HI>de Ranes</HI> went to <HI>I&s;&s;el&s;taing</HI> and <HI>Monfort,</HI> leading thither &s;ome Dragoons to reinforce tho&s;e Garri&s;ons. The &s;ame day about evening, the King came to vi&s;it <HI>&V;|trecht;</HI> and he was &s;carce gone thence when the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Arlington,</HI> Emba&s;&s;adors from the King of England arriv'd, hoping to have found his Maje&s;ty there, to whom they were &s;ent by the King their Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>The 7 the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Arlington</HI> went from <HI>&V;trecht</HI> to the Camp at <HI>Zei&s;t,</HI> where the King pre&s;ently gave them Audience, after which a Courier was di&s;patch'd to the King of England, who was mightily &s;ollicited by the Dutch Mi|ni&s;ters to a Peace.</P>
<P>The Enemy came and attaqu'd <HI>Oudwater,</HI> and beat back our hor&s;e Guard, after hav|ing killed 5 or 6 of them with the like lo&s;s on their &s;ide, but the Alarm being &s;treight
<PB N="115" REF="59">given to Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Rochefort,</HI> he pre&s;ent|ly went to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as did al&s;o the Marquis <HI>de Ranes</HI> with his <HI>Regiment Royal</HI> of Dragoons, but they at their arrival found the Enemy retir'd, &s;o that all the&s;e &s;up|plies kept a guard all that night upon the Place. The Mu&s;queteers, who ever &s;ince the &s;urrender of <HI>&V;trecht</HI> had been either within the Town to &s;ecure it, or encamp'd ju&s;t be|fore it with Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Roche&s;orts</HI> Army, return'd now to the Kings Camp at <HI>Zei&s;t,</HI> a part of who&s;e Guard they were. The three Bataillons of the Regiment of Guards, w^c^h the Duke <HI>de Roannez</HI> had with him in the &s;ame place, did the like, and in their &s;tead were &s;ent thither, one Bataillon of the Kings, and another of the Queens Regiment, the Regiment of <HI>Ca&s;telnan,</HI> the Royal Re|giment <HI>de la Marine,</HI> and that of <HI>Suitzers,</HI> who&s;e Colonel is the Sieur <HI>Stouppe,</HI> who al&s;o commanded the Place, as belonging of right to him whil&s;t that the King had yet appoint|ed no Governour of it. The re&s;t of the Re|giment of <HI>Turenne</HI> was &s;ent to <HI>Naerden,</HI> to relieve tho&s;e of the <HI>Dauphin</HI>'s which lay there, and many foot were &s;ent to reinforce M. <HI>de Rochefort</HI>'s Army, which his Maje&s;ty in|tended to leave about <HI>&V;trecht,</HI> as well to keep all that part of the Country quiet, as to hinder the Hollanders Armys, which lay

<P>The eight in the morning, Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Rochefort</HI> order'd &s;ome powder and &s;hot to be &s;ent to <HI>Oudewater,</HI> with a Convoy of hor&s;e, and then he returned with the Troops he had brought the day before.

<P>The 9, the Duke of <HI>Luxembourg</HI> return|ed to the Kings Army, with the Marquis <HI>de la Valiere,</HI> having left his Baggage and Equippage near <HI>Emerick,</HI> and the command of his Army to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> who came likewi&s;e to give the King a vi&s;it, and then returned towards <HI>Frizeland,</HI> where &s;ince he hath done the Enemy much harm.

<P>The King gave 8000 <HI>livres,</HI> among tho&s;e who had lo&s;t their hor&s;es in the late fire.</P>
<P>The 10 the King left <HI>Zei&s;t</HI> (which lyes within 2 leagues of <HI>&V;trecht</HI>) where he had lain 8 days, and went back to encamp be|tween <HI>Rhenen</HI> and <HI>Wageningen.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Luxembourg</HI> went to the Camp before <HI>&V;|trecht</HI> to command that Army, which M. the Marquis <HI>de Rochefort</HI> left to follow the King; which Army was found to con&s;i&s;t of between 15000 and 16000 men.</P>
<P>The 11 in the morning, the King went and encamped in the Suburbs of <HI>Arnhem,</HI> the Government of which, together with tho&s;e of <HI>Nimegen,</HI> the whole I&s;le of <HI>Betaw,</HI> and <HI>Grave,</HI> he be&s;towed on the Count <HI>de Lorge,</HI> with a pen&s;ion of 1000 Crowns monthly, M. <HI>de Turenne,</HI> who had march'd with his Army towards <HI>Grave,</HI> came to wait on his Maje&s;ty &s;oon after his arrival, and having a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the Council which was held, returned and lay at <HI>Nimegen.</HI> The weather which had &s;ome days threatned a change, at la&s;t became very fowl, and from this day forward, rain, wind, and cold did
<PB N="118" REF="61">as much trouble us, as if it had been the middle of Winter, till we returned again into the Climate of <HI>France.</HI> This &s;tormy weather was very favorable to many Towns, which otherwi&s;e would certainly have been taken as others had been.</P>
<P>The 12, the King left <HI>Arnhem,</HI> and having pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Rhine,</HI> over a Bridge of Boats made for that purpo&s;e a little below the Town, marched through the I&s;le <HI>Betaw,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Wahal</HI> al&s;o upon a Float over again&s;t <HI>Nimegen,</HI> where he lay that night. All the former night and this day we wrought hard in making a Bridge, to pa&s;s over the Army, Artillery, and Baggage, but not being able to &s;ini&s;h it time enough, one part of the Army was forced to &s;tay in the I&s;le till the next day. Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> left <HI>Ni|megen</HI> betimes in the morning, and went to <HI>Grave,</HI> where he found his Army pa&s;|&s;ing the <HI>Meu&s;e,</HI> over a bridge of boats which had been, made above the Town, and the Marquis <HI>de Ranes</HI> met there a part of the Regiment <HI>Colonel</HI> of Dragoons, which had &s;taid there for the defence of the Place, whil&s;t the re&s;t were gone to joyn with the Count <HI>de Chamilly</HI>'s Army, which lay beyond the <HI>Bu&s;&s;e,</HI> between that Town, <HI>Heu&s;den</HI> and the Fort <HI>Crevecoeur,</HI> at a place called <HI>&V;ly|men.</HI> As &s;oon as the whole Army had pa&s;|&s;ed

<P>We mu&s;t not forget to let you know, that <HI>Grave,</HI> though it be but a little Town, yet is one of the prettie&s;t, plea&s;ante&s;t, &s;trong|e&s;t, and ea&s;ilye&s;t defended places, that I have &s;een. It is &s;ituated on the right bank of the <HI>Meu&s;e,</HI> which does very much &s;trength|en it on that &s;ide, and on the other &s;ide it hath a great mar&s;h, always full of water, which makes it inacce&s;&s;ible at all times, be|&s;ides it hath excellent Fortifications, and in good repair, but above all a great Horn|work very well &s;ecured with a covered way, which goes to the very Gate, with excel|lent Ravelins, be&s;ides a good Counter&s;carp, and a Palli&s;ado which is but newly made, and is in very good order, and &s;trong Bul|warks: &s;o that I may truly &s;ay that I have not &s;een in <HI>Holland</HI> a prettier Town, better in order, or in a likelier condition to defend it &s;elf. It hath been often taken and re|taken, the fir&s;t time was in the year 1586, when the Prince of <HI>Parma</HI> be&s;iedged it, and had it &s;urrendred to him upon Articles; and then it was again retaken in 1602, by Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> of <HI>Na&s;&s;au,</HI> and &s;ince hath conti|nued in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The 13, becau&s;e of the Bridges not being

<P>The 14 the King left <HI>Nimegen,</HI> and march|ed towards <HI>Grave,</HI> where he pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Meu&s;e,</HI> and encamp'd on the left &s;ide of that River. Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> went and view'd the Fort of <HI>Crevecoeur,</HI> and though news came that the Inhabitants of <HI>Bommelle</HI> had &s;ent to the King to capitulate, he not|with&s;tanding &s;ent a Trumpet to &s;ummon it. M. <HI>de Montauban</HI> advanced on the other &s;ide of the <HI>Bu&s;&s;e</HI> with 4000 hor&s;e. The weather began to make the Country almo&s;t unpa&s;|&s;able; the cold, rain, and wind grew very trouble&s;ome, &s;o that we could hardly find the Cau&s;&s;eys, though there be no going any where el&s;e, the whole Country being nothing but mar&s;hes and dikes.</P>
<P>The 15 his Maje&s;ty left <HI>Grave,</HI> and came
<PB N="121" REF="62">within a league of <HI>Boxtel,</HI> a little Town near the <HI>Bu&s;&s;e,</HI> but of very great importance, be|cau&s;e it commands the Sluces, which either keep in, or let out the waters, all over this part of the Country. But at this time they had no great need of them, the rain having already &s;o plentifully fallen, that all about the Town was overflown, which hinder'd us from be&s;ieging it, as we before de&s;ign'd.</P>
<P>The Bridge which Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> had ordered to be made over the <HI>Meu&s;e,</HI> for communication between his Camp and the I&s;le of <HI>Bommelle,</HI> was now fini&s;hed; he ordered 10000 Faggots to be prepared, and view'd the Fort again, which he found to be a very good one, and that it commands the Sluces below the <HI>Bu&s;&s;e,</HI> as <HI>Boxtel</HI> doth above it. It hath 5 good and large Ba&s;tions, though they be not coated: the Garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ted of 800 men, who might well de|fend the Place, which was &s;ecured on one &s;ide by the River, and on the other by a great unpa&s;&s;able Mar&s;h, and which (had we not provided again&s;t it by &s;etting a guard on the pa&s;&s;age) might have kept corre&s;pon|dence with the <HI>Bu&s;&s;e,</HI> and been releiv'd and a&s;&s;i&s;ted from thence as oft as they would.</P>
<P>The 16 the King went to <HI>Boxtel,</HI> where he found no re&s;i&s;tance. Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> as &s;oon as the Faggots he had order'd were
<PB N="122" REF="63">ready, made the hor&s;e carry them, and in the evening cau&s;ed the Trenches to be open|ed by the Regiments <HI>de Champagne, Lyonnois,</HI> and <HI>de Louvigny,</HI> who advanced them very far, and rai&s;ed a Battery on that &s;ide where the <HI>Champagne</HI> Regiment was, whereon were planted two peices of Canon, which were ready to play by day break. They likewi&s;e very much forwarded another, which was began in the <HI>Lyonnois</HI> Regiment's quarters, to plant 8 peices on. The be&s;iedged, who were certainly by the ill &s;ea&s;on lulled a &s;leep, and thought it not po&s;&s;ible we &s;hould work in &s;uch tempe&s;tuous weather, di&s;charg'd not above 7 or 8 Guns at us, which hurt no body. The Duke of <HI>Luxembourg,</HI> who, as we &s;aid, &s;taid at <HI>&V;trecht</HI> with 15 or 16000 men, encamped without S. <HI>Catharin</HI>'s Gate, chang'd his quarters, and pa&s;&s;ing the Canale which runs from thence to <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> went beyond a part of the Suburbs which lies on the other &s;ide, and encamped not far from the Town, between it and <HI>Naerden,</HI> after having defeated a party of the Enemy, who had &s;et upon his van-Guard.</P>
<P>The 17 the King re&s;ted with all his Army at <HI>Boxtel,</HI> and departed not thence till he return'd for <HI>France.</HI> In the morning as we &s;aid the <HI>Lyonnois</HI> Regiment's Battery began to play upon <HI>Crevccoeur,</HI> and beat down a
<PB N="123" REF="63">Redout which lay on the left &s;ide of the Fort toward the River, &s;o that &s;ome Sol|diers which were in it were forced to aban|don it, and retire to their fellows in the Fort it &s;elf; afterwards 100 <HI>Grenadiers</HI> were placed upon the Channel that comes from the <HI>Bu&s;&s;e,</HI> to hinder the communication of the Enemy with that place, and a Serjeunt with 20 men lodged about 30 paces from the declivity of the works, behind the ruines of a Redout, which the Enemy had quitted and fired &s;ome days before. The Grand Ma|&s;ter of the Artillery came and brought with him 16 peices of Canon, 8 of which were &s;ent to be mounted on the Battery fi|ni&s;hed the night before in the <HI>Champagne</HI> Re|giments quarter. The Marquis <HI>de Ranes</HI> took with him all the Dragoons that were in M. <HI>de Turennes</HI> Army after dinner, and went with them to the Count <HI>de Chamilly's,</HI> with whom was the re&s;t of the <HI>&V;lymen</HI> Camp: this Army was likewi&s;e now bu&s;ied in car|rying Faggots, to &s;et upon <HI>Crevecoeur</HI> on their &s;ide al&s;o.</P>
<P>The 18 his Maje&s;ty kept at <HI>Boxtel,</HI> where nothing extraordinary happened. The Battery of 8 peices of Canon which was begun the night before by the <HI>Lyonnois</HI> Regiment before <HI>Crevecoeur,</HI> was fini&s;h'd and ready to play by break of day; and the Enemy &s;oon were
<PB N="124" REF="64">made &s;en&s;ible of it by having 6 of their Guns di&s;mounted in a little time; on the Count <HI>Cha|milly</HI>'s &s;ide, Trenches were likewi&s;e open'd, from w^c^h they gave a fal&s;e Alarm. M. <HI>de la. Fo|re&s;t</HI> Lieutenant Colonel of the Dragoons, went in the morning, and cau&s;ed all the Trees about the Avenues of his Camp to be fell'd to hinder the Enemy, who was very &s;trong in <HI>Heu&s;den,</HI> from &s;etting on him behind, but they attemted no &s;uch thing; on the con|trary the Marquis <HI>de Ranes,</HI> after dinner ac|companied by &s;ome of his Dragoons, march'd towards them, and beat back their Guards, and made them retire within their Palli&s;ado, on purpo&s;e to entice them out to fight, but none of them &s;tirr'd, only &s;ome volleys of &s;mall &s;hot were let fly at us from their works. In the mean time, the Duke of <HI>Buc|kingham</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Arlington,</HI> the En|gli&s;h Amba&s;&s;adors, having di&s;patch'd their bu&s;ine&s;s, took leave, and returned by <HI>Bru&s;|&s;els,</HI> that &s;o they might require the Count <HI>Monterey,</HI> the Governor of the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> to withdraw all the Spani&s;h Forces from the Dutch &s;ervice, or upon his refu&s;al to de|nounce War again&s;t him in the name of the King of <HI>England;</HI> and tell him that he would immediately fall to acts of ho&s;tility again&s;t the Spaniard. Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Villacerre</HI> ac|companied them to be a witne&s;s of their
<PB N="125" REF="64">Conference, and the Engli&s;h and French Fleet came up as far as the <HI>Texel,</HI> with de&s;ign to land, if he refu&s;ed a&s;&s;ent to the propo&s;al: but the Count <HI>de Monterey</HI> made an&s;wer, that the bu&s;ine&s;s was of &s;uch importance as he could not an&s;wer till he had acquainted his Superiors with it, and therefore de&s;ired time till he might &s;end to <HI>Madrid,</HI> and then he would act according to the in&s;tructions he &s;hould receive thence.</P>
<P>An Officer that went a pickering with a party of Hor&s;e towards <HI>Breda,</HI> met with a party of the Enemy, and though ours was but 30 again&s;t 80, he made them give ground, and after &s;omere&s;i&s;tance wholly routed them: but 500 Pea&s;ants, which had gathered to|gether, and &s;trongly intrenched them&s;elves endeavour'd to cut off the retreat of our men, &s;o that they were feign to force their way, w^c^h they did happily enough through their fir&s;t barricado, but when they came to the &s;econd, the ca&s;e was altered, for the Pea&s;ants had &s;ent to the routed party of the Enemy, to bid them rally and &s;et on our men behind, whil&s;t they would oppo&s;e them before, and &s;top their pa&s;&s;age. The project took &s;o well that they defeated our party, and though there were not many killed upon the place, yet it fared the wor&s;e with them that &s;caped; for falling into the hands of the Pea&s;ants,
<PB N="126" REF="65">there was no &s;ort of cruelty which they en|dured not from them; but they were not long unrevenged, for the King hearing of their barbarous u&s;age the &s;ame evening, pre|&s;ently ordered a party to go and put all tho&s;e Villages to fire and &s;word.</P>
<P>On the 19, which was the day following, the Cheva&s;ier <HI>Fourille</HI> marched out by break of day with the Brigades <HI>de la Feuill&eacute;e</HI> and <HI>de Roye,</HI> and 200 Dragoons which M. <HI>de Ranes</HI> had &s;ent him, under the command of the Chevalier <HI>de Tilladet,</HI> Camp ma&s;ter to the Regiment <HI>Collonel,</HI> with orders to burn, plunder, and put to the &s;word all that they &s;hould meet; and accordingly they burnt and plundered the Villages: but the Pea&s;ants having heard of the de&s;ign, were for the mo&s;t part fled, &s;o that few of them fell into our hands; but being very near <HI>Breda,</HI> &s;ome Dragoons who were commanded to &s;et fire at any place where they could, went up to the very Gates of the Town, and there fired &s;ome hou&s;es whil&s;t the re&s;t of the party and the Hor&s;e defended them; this troubled the Town a little, who thought &s;ure there|upon that we were coming to be&s;iege them.</P>
<P>The Governor of <HI>Crevecoeur,</HI> finding we &s;hould now &s;oon be in a condition to a&s;&s;ault the Place, re&s;olved to &s;tand out no longer, and that he might get the better conditions,
<PB N="127" REF="65">went him&s;elf to make them; &s;o he came forth and de&s;ired to &s;peak with M. <HI>de Turenne,</HI> who gave order he &s;hould be civilly intreated, but would not &s;ee him. He only di&s;armed the Garri&s;on, and becau&s;e we had more Pri|&s;oners then we could well tell what to do with, he had them all conducted a league from the Place, and there gave them their liberty, as he had done before to tho&s;e of <HI>Nimegen,</HI> among which he had found 500 or 600 Citizens of <HI>&V;trecht,</HI> whom he &s;ent to their own homes.</P>
<P><HI>Hinkel</HI> which is a little Fort between the <HI>Bu&s;&s;e</HI> and <HI>Crevecoeur,</HI> was taken by the Count <HI>de Chamilly,</HI> with more ea&s;e then he him&s;elf did expect: for the Garri&s;on either being frighted, or having heard that we intended to a&s;&s;ault them, quited it after having &s;et fire on their powder and the hou&s;es of the Fort, a part of which were notwith&s;tand|ing &s;aved.</P>
<P>The 20, the King, who continued &s;till at <HI>Boxtel,</HI> having heard of the &s;urrender of <HI>Crevecoeur,</HI> came and viewed the Fort, and afterwards returned, whil&s;t M. <HI>de Turenne</HI> pa&s;&s;ed over the I&s;land of <HI>Bommelle,</HI> and &s;ent and &s;ummoned the Town which bears the &s;ame name.

<PB N="128" REF="66">out a long Siege, and de&s;paired of being relieved; they likewi&s;e &s;aw that many Towns better fortified and Garri&s;on'd then they, had not been able with all their &s;trength to defend them&s;elves; and that all the Country round about them was already in our po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion; but on the other &s;ide al&s;o they re|membred that they had formerly born up again&s;t all the fury of 25000 Spani&s;h foot, when their Fortifications were by no means in &s;o good a condition as at pre&s;ent: and be&s;ides a certain little Collonel, who had before been in <HI>Nimegen</HI> whil&s;t we be&s;iedged it (and who would have &s;till been among the re&s;t of our Pri&s;oners had he not been re|lea&s;ed) and was afterwards made Governor of this Town, thought him&s;elf engaged in honour of which he had much bragged to M. <HI>de Turenne,</HI> not &s;o lightly to yeild up a Place of that importance; wherefore we were forced to &s;et on them, and as we came before the Place, the Guides brought M. <HI>de Turenne</HI> &s;o near that a Cannon bullet, which had been &s;hot from the Town, fell ju&s;t at his feet; but that hindered not our proceed|ings, we therefore went and encamped at <HI>Stel&s;t;</HI> which is a little Village lying upon the River, within Canon &s;hot below the Town.</P>

<P>Whil&s;t the Kings Quarters were prepa|ring, &s;ome attendants, having retired them|&s;elves into a certain grove to refre&s;h them|&s;elves till a hou&s;e &s;hould be appointed them for their Ma&s;ter, perceiv'd the ground had lately been turn'd up there, which gave them the curio&s;ity to &s;earch if nothing were hid|den underneath, whereupon one of them felt with his &s;word, and finding &s;ome re|&s;i&s;tance, uncovered the place before &s;ome Officers that were then come thither, and there found 28 dead bodies newly kill'd, piled one upon the other, divers of which tho&s;e Officers knew to have been our hor&s;e.</P>
<P>The Count <HI>de Chamilly</HI> left <HI>&V;lymen,</HI> and went over with his Army to Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Turennes</HI> Army at <HI>Hempel,</HI> and in the mean time order'd the fort of <HI>Hainkel</HI> to be &s;lighted.</P>
<P>The 21 about 10 in the morning, the be|&s;ieged in <HI>Bommel,</HI> who from the top of their works could ea&s;ily &s;ee that we were en|camped upon the River, ventur'd out of the Town, without any oppo&s;ition, fill'd a <HI>Fregate,</HI> which carried 4. or 5 pieces of Canon, with Soldiers, and coming down the River ere we were aware of them, arriv'd over again&s;t our Camp, where they landed and made a di&s;charge of their muskets and Canon loaded with &s;mall &s;hot, among&s;t our Tents,
<PB N="130" REF="67">by which they kill'd &s;ome few of our Ca|valiers, and many of their hor&s;es: thereupon &s;ome of our men made up to them, and our foot beating them back to the River &s;ide, &s;hew'd them &s;o much vigour and courage in the Skirmi&s;h, that they retir'd to the other &s;ide of the River, which is out of Musket &s;hot. They came back however two or three times to di&s;charge again, but were &s;till repul&s;ed, though not without difficulty and the lo&s;s of &s;ome men; for the Marquis de <HI>Ranes</HI> having got between the Town and them at a place where the River is much narrower, forc'd them to &s;tand one of our di&s;charges, which they did, but not to be behind hand with him, an&s;wered it with their Muskets and Canon charged as be|fore; &s;o that one Dragoon lo&s;t an arm, and another a leg. But as ill fortune for them would have it, the fire caught in their pow|der room, and &s;o fired one end of their Ve&s;&s;el, whereupon 7 or 8 of them for fear of being burnt, flung them&s;elves into the water, where they all peri&s;h'd, being either drown'd or killed by our men, who were skirmi&s;hing on the &s;hore, this accident fright|ed them &s;o, that from that time forward they dared not venter out. At the &s;ame time Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> ordered Faggots to be made, and &s;ent a Trumpet to &s;ummon the
<PB N="131" REF="67">Place once again, the be&s;iedged let him in, and went to coun&s;el, which la&s;ted 5 or 6 hours, wherefore M. <HI>de Turenne</HI> &s;ent M. <HI>Baleroy,</HI> a Captain of hor&s;e, with another Trumpet, to enquire what was become of the fir&s;t, the Governor de&s;ired M. <HI>de Bale|roy</HI> to come in, which he did, and they a&s;|&s;ured him they would &s;urrender, be&s;eeching him to de&s;ire M. <HI>de Turenne</HI> to &s;end Articles, which he thereupon pre&s;ently did. In the mean time, M. <HI>de S.

<P>An hour or two after dinner, a <HI>Fregate</HI> with men to put into <HI>Bommel,</HI> came up the River from <HI>Worcum,</HI> (or <HI>Gorcum</HI>) but having been made more cautious by what happen'd in the morning, we had plac'd a <HI>Corps de Garde</HI> on divers places of the Banks, &s;o that they could not pa&s;s, and were forc'd to go back as they came, after having made a di&s;charge or two of their Muskets and Ca|non charged with &s;mall &s;hot.

<P><HI>Bommel</HI> is a great Town, &s;ituate (as we &s;aid) on the left bank of the <HI>Wahal,</HI> 3 leagues above <HI>Gorcum;</HI> its &s;ituation is very advantagious both upon the account of the <HI>Wahal,</HI> which defends one &s;ide of it, and of the Mar&s;hes which encompa&s;s it on the other, and which are &s;o deep that one can neither undermine nor keep Trenches long open before it. Its Fortifications are likewi&s;e good, and the Hollander who have made it one of the Keys of their Country, have not forgot to keep them in repair, but made its pre&s;ervation one of their cheif cares. It is &s;urrounded with good Cortin's, Ba&s;tions and Towers, a double Rampart, and a double ditch. It was be&s;iedg'd in 1599 for the <HI>Spaniard</HI> by Don <HI>France&s;co de Mendoza</HI> high Admiral of <HI>Arragon,</HI> who after many &s;tra|tagems, at la&s;t vented all his fury upon this Place, which he be&s;ieged with 30000 men, but was notwith&s;tanding forced after a fort|night's
<PB N="133" REF="68">&s;tay to rai&s;e his Siege. By which we may judge of the &s;trength and con&s;equence of this Place.</P>
<P>The 22, after a Garri&s;on had been put into <HI>Bommel,</HI> the whole I&s;land became &s;ub|ject to the King, the Forts of S. <HI>Andrew</HI> and of <HI>Wornes</HI> being already po&s;&s;e&s;t by our Dra|goons, Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> departed hence with his Army, and came back to <HI>Hempel,</HI> where being to march through the Town he din'd. The Artillery by rea&s;on of the bad ways having not been able to keep pace with the Army, came behind under the Convoy of the Dragoons. Tho&s;e who had been drawn out on the 19 to fire the Villages, who&s;e Pea&s;ants had beaten and &s;o barbarou&s;ly u&s;ed our party, returned after having routed 100 foot and 50 <HI>Mai&s;tres</HI> of <HI>Breda,</HI> which they met with. Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Montauban</HI> was made Governor of <HI>Zutphen,</HI> M. <HI>de Beauvez&eacute;</HI> of <HI>Rees,</HI> and M. <HI>de Villiers</HI> of <HI>Doesburg.</HI> This day there arriv'd at <HI>Boxtel</HI> an <HI>Envoye</HI> from the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> with many Propo&s;i|tions for a Peace; which made the World think it would at la&s;t come to &s;omething.</P>
<P>The 23 after the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s <HI>En|voy</HI> had made known his Propo&s;itions, the King ordered a Drummer to go with him to <HI>Bru&s;&s;ells,</HI> that he might know the Count <HI>de Monterey</HI>'s an&s;wer to the Duke of <HI>Buc|kingham</HI>
<PB N="134" REF="69">and the Earl of <HI>Arlington</HI>'s demands in the King of <HI>England</HI>'s name, which was to call back all the Spani&s;h Forces that were either in <HI>Breda,</HI> the <HI>Bu&s;&s;e, Bergen-op Zoom,</HI> or the Dutch Army's. M. <HI>de Turenne</HI> came to wait on his Maje&s;ty at <HI>Boxtel,</HI> and lay there that night following, and his Army the while re&s;ted at <HI>Hompel,</HI> whether the Ordnance being arriv'd with their Convoy, they were &s;ent on a league forward of the next day's journey towards the Kings Quarters.</P>
<P>The 24 the King called a Council of War, at which he him&s;elf was pre&s;ent, as he always u&s;ed to be; and it was there re|&s;olved, that after his Maje&s;ty's departure, (who intended to return and refre&s;h him|&s;elf a while in <HI>France</HI> after the toile he en|dured in the <HI>Campagne</HI>) Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> &s;hould &s;tay behind in <HI>Brabant</HI> with 20000 men, and &s;hould have for his Lieutenants general, the <HI>Sieurs de S.

<PB N="135" REF="69">and &s;ome others which he &s;hould have given him to the number of 4000 hor&s;e, and lye about <HI>Wezel.</HI> And becau&s;e the King in|tended to return again, as &s;oon as he &s;hould have given &s;uch orders at home as were nece&s;&s;ary, he &s;ent mo&s;t part of his Equi|page and heavie&s;t Baggage to <HI>Grave,</HI> that he might not be troubled to &s;end them back|wards, but that at his return he might meet them there in readine&s;s.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day the Duke of <HI>Neubourg</HI> came to <HI>Boxtel</HI> to give his Maje&s;ty a vi&s;it, and Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Turenne</HI>'s <HI>Army</HI> leaving <HI>Hempel,</HI> advanc'd towards <HI>Beerlicon</HI> within 2 leagues of the Kings Quarters, and remain'd there till after his Maje&s;ty departure; whom M. <HI>de Turenne</HI> left not till then. At the &s;ame time the Spani&s;h Troops in the Hollanders &s;er|vice, having heard of the Propo&s;als which the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Arling|ton</HI> were going to make with Count <HI>Mon|terey,</HI> and knowing that the <HI>Spaniard</HI> was not in a condition to maintain a War of that importance as he was thrcaten'd with upon refu&s;al, pack'd up bag and baggage, and made them&s;elves ready to depart, upon the fir&s;t orders to that purpo&s;e, which they doubted not but they &s;hould &s;peedily receive. Some per&s;ons whom we met in our march told us they went every day to the <HI>Bu&s;&s;e,</HI>
<PB N="136" REF="70">and a&s;&s;ur'd us they had &s;een the &s;aid Troops there, who were very weary of the &s;ervice, and complain'd much of their ill diet and pay.</P>
<P>The 25, the King after having treated the Duke of <HI>Neubourg,</HI> had him out to view the Troops that belong'd to his per&s;on, and &s;ome others that were then with him, and in the evening when he came back, he let us know that he would be going the next morning for <HI>France,</HI> and accordingly gave order that all things &s;hould be in a readine&s;s for his departure again&s;t that time.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day he committed the Govern|ment of <HI>Lorraine</HI> to the Marquis <HI>de Roche|fort.</HI></P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Turennes</HI> Army re&s;ted at <HI>Beerlicon,</HI> and the Count <HI>du Lude</HI> Grand-Ma&s;ter of the Ordnance left it, and came to <HI>Boxtel</HI> with a part of the Artillery, which was to follow the King. Some few days after, the Marquis <HI>de Ranes</HI> General of the Dragoons, and the Count <HI>de Guiche</HI> Lieu|tenant General of the Prince's Army, came thither likewi&s;e, the King having order'd them to follow him into <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The 26 in the morning, the King de|parted from <HI>Boxtel,</HI> and came to lye at <HI>Borkel,</HI> which is a great Abbey of white <HI>Fryars</HI> in the way from <HI>Boxtel</HI> to <HI>Tongres.</HI>
<PB N="137" REF="70">His Maje&s;ty lodg'd in the Abbey, but al|mo&s;t all the Court was forced to encamp about it, becau&s;e there were very few hou&s;es thereabouts. A great part of the Regiment of <HI>Guards</HI> &s;taid behind, to joyn with M. <HI>de Turenne</HI>'s Army, as did all the re&s;t of the Foot which was in the Kings retinue, becau&s;e they could not keep pace with the King, who intended thence forwards to take great Journeys; only 12 Companies were order'd to follow &s;oftly after him to <HI>Paris.</HI> Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> return'd to lead his Army, which lay &s;till at <HI>Beerlicon;</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Mechlebourg</HI> came to vi&s;it the King at <HI>Bor|kel.</HI></P>
<P>The 27 in the morning, the King left <HI>Borkel,</HI> which lies in <HI>Brabant,</HI> and within the Territories that belonged to the Hol|lander, and having pa&s;&s;ed by <HI>Beringen,</HI> which is a little Town in <HI>Liege,</HI> went and lodg'd a league beyond that Town.</P>
<P>The 28 in the morning, the Light-hor&s;e which had hitherto accompanied the King, returned to joyn with M. <HI>de Turenne</HI>'s Army, which had not yet di&s;encamped; his Ma|je&s;ty came to a little Village called <HI>Leuve,</HI> within a league of <HI>Hannuy,</HI> a little Town of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> where we met &s;ome <HI>Cravates</HI> belonging to the Spani&s;h-Troops. The heavy baggage of the Court, and tho&s;e that be|longed
<PB N="138" REF="71">to them, had orders not to accom|pany the King any farther, but to march after lei&s;urely with a Convoy which was ordered for them all. The &s;ame kind of bag|gage which belonged to the Kings Hou&s;hold, was &s;ent to <HI>Mae&s;iick</HI> with another Convoy. The King in the middle of this day's Jour|ney met Mon&s;ieur <HI>Vaubrun</HI> with 2000 hor&s;e, a 1000 of which he left with his Maje&s;ty to guard him beyond <HI>Binche,</HI> and returned with the re&s;t to M. <HI>de Turenne</HI>'s Army.</P>
<P>The 29 the King left <HI>Leuve</HI> betimes in the morning, and having &s;taid to dine in the middle of his Journy, he was inform'd that all the heavy Baggages had been taken and plundered, &s;ome &s;aid by a party which &s;ally'd out of <HI>Mae&s;tricht,</HI> and others by the <HI>Cravates</HI> we met at <HI>Hannuy.</HI> His Maje&s;ty thereupon &s;ent in ha&s;t to know the certainty of the bu&s;ine&s;s, but the <HI>Courier</HI> brought back word, that only M. <HI>Brancas</HI>'s Baggage had been taken by &s;ome hor&s;e of the Enemy's who being aware that his Waggoner drove a good way before the re&s;t, made him turn into the Woods, where they took away the hor&s;es, and left the re&s;t to be riffled by the Pea&s;ants, who had hid and &s;heltered them|&s;elves there ever &s;ince the beginning of the War.</P>
<PB N="139" REF="71">
<P>The 30 the King, continuing his march, left <HI>Ameley</HI> betimes in the morning, and came by <HI>Binche,</HI> where without entring the Place he dined at the Gate, and afterwards went and lodged a league beyond that Place, up|on the road of <HI>Que&s;noy.</HI> This day he order'd the Van of his Life Guard, and the Bri|gades of the Men at Arms and light Hor&s;e|men to go before, and expect him at the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Cambray,</HI> where he intended to &s;pend the next day.</P>
<P>The 31, the King &s;etting out by break of day, arriv'd at <HI>Que&s;noy</HI> about 11 of the Clock, where taking only a little broth, he went to bed, and re&s;ted till 5 in the evening, and then after a light repa&s;t, took Coach, (which he had not done before during all this <HI>Campagne,</HI> but had always travail'd on hor&s;eback whatever weather it was) and rode on all night accompany'd by a &s;trong Con|voy, which had been drawn out of the Life Guards, Men at Arms, Light Hor&s;emen and Mu&s;queteers, who accompany'd him to the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Cambray,</HI> where he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them, and made u&s;e of tho&s;e he had &s;ent two days before to expect him there; and &s;o march't on with them all the night following. Almo&s;t all the Court &s;taid at <HI>Que&s;noy</HI> to come lea|&s;urely after, becau&s;e the King had hor&s;es lay'd for him by the way, and the re&s;t of
<PB N="140" REF="72">the hor&s;es that came from the Army were not able to keep pace with them. The Troops that belong'd to the Kings <HI>Hou&s;hold</HI> encamp'd before the Gates of <HI>Que&s;noy.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> the King arriv'd at S. <HI>Quintin</HI> by 4. of the Clock in the morning, heard <HI>Ma&s;s</HI> in the Church of S. <HI>James,</HI> and having taken a little broth, which was brought him from M. <HI>de Pradelle</HI> the Governour of that Town to a Sem&s;tre&s;&s;e's Shop, took Coach again and went on to <HI>Ham,</HI> where he left his Convoy, and at length arrived by 10 at night at S. <HI>Germains,</HI> where the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ueen did not expect him till the Thur&s;day following.

<P>REaders, I grow weary of venting my Wares thus by retail. The re&s;t are of the &s;ame kind with the former, but I will give them out to you now in the gro&s;s. They are not deceitfull I can a&s;&s;ure you: for though I have not been an Eye|witne&s;s to what I &s;hall henceforward re|late, as I was to all that pa&s;s'd during the Kings &s;tay in Holland, yet I have it from &s;ome of my Friends who &s;ent me their memoirs, and having no de&s;ign to mi&s;|inform me, took care to write nothing but what they knew for certain truth. And what has confirm'd me in my good opinion of their veracity, is, that I find them alto|gether conformable to the Accounts that were con&s;tantly brought to Court of what pa&s;s'd in our Armies. You will find here &s;ome Particulars and Circum&s;tances, which 'tis likely you have not heard of be|fore, and which I promi&s;e my &s;elf you will not be &s;orry to know. I wi&s;h I could have
<PB REF="74">done more both for your Service and Sa|tisfaction, and in requital, de&s;ire you to pardon what you &s;hall find ami&s;s. I wil|lingly confe&s;s my weakne&s;: and unfitne&s;s to be an Author. As I never valued my &s;elf upon appearing in Print, &s;o what I have done now, was only in complai&s;ance to &s;ome who de&s;ir'd it.</P>

<HEAD>A CONTINUATION Of what happen'd in the Dutch WAR, After the Kings return into <HI>France.</HI></HEAD>
<P>OUr invincible Monarch having &s;uffici|ently humbled the haughty States, and left a general con&s;ternation all o|ver their Country, which made his very name formidable to the &s;toute&s;t of them, took his way for <HI>France</HI> as we before men|tion'd.</P>
<P>His ab&s;ence a little rais'd their &s;pirits, &s;o that they ventur'd out of their Intrench|ments and march'd towards <HI>Woerden, Croa|nembourg,</HI> and &s;om other &s;mall Towns, which we had left ungarri&s;on'd only upon pro|mi&s;e of their Fidelity, not judging it nece&s;|&s;ary to be&s;tow Garri&s;ons on them, that did of nece&s;&s;ity fall into the Hands of him that was Ma&s;ter of the Field. They put &s;ome Forces into them, and po&s;&s;e&s;s'd them awhile quietly enough, and it may be we &s;hould not have concern'd our &s;elves &s;o far
<PB N="146" REF="75">as to drive them out, had not the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> de&s;ign'd to make Incur&s;ions into the liberties of <HI>&V;trecht,</HI> and to u&s;e <HI>Woerden</HI> as his retreat. Whereupon the Duke of <HI>Lux|embourg,</HI> who, as we &s;aid before, command|ed the Army near <HI>&V;trecht,</HI> and now permit|ted it to re&s;t and refre&s;h it &s;elf, glad to find an opportunity of doing &s;omething for his Kings Service, took the Field, and &s;treight march'd to <HI>Croanembourg,</HI> where (the Hor&s;e upon notice of their de&s;ign, &s;ecuring them|&s;elves by a timely retreat) they &s;oon made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the Foot, who with|out much re&s;i&s;tance, were made Pri&s;oners of War: and not only they, but 72 more, who intrench'd them&s;elves in a Ca&s;tle that lay on the way, and for 5 or 6 hours kept our Dra|goons in play, having killed 10 or 12, and broke Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Rouvray</HI>'s arm, who commanded our Hor&s;e and the Attaque on one &s;ide, with a Musket-&s;hot. Afterwards the Duke march'd to <HI>Woerden,</HI> which far'd no better then <HI>Croanembourg,</HI> and the Count <HI>de la Mark</HI> was left there with the <HI>Picardy</HI> Regiment.</P>
<P>The&s;e proceedings did more trouble the States then one can well imagine: for be&s;ides the confu&s;ion it put them in, the lo&s;s of this la&s;t place, though it be little, and in it &s;elf in|con&s;iderable, yet was of great importance
<PB N="147" REF="75">to them, becau&s;e it gave us admi&s;&s;ion into the heart of their Country, and cut off all communication between divers of their great Towns. So they pre&s;ently call'd a Council of War, and very earne&s;tly de&s;ir'd the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> pre&s;ently to be&s;iege it, who, thinking it a bu&s;ine&s;s of no difficulty, the Town being but &s;lenderly fortified, clos'd with the propo&s;al, not doubting of car|rying it, and reckoning it would do well to fle&s;h his heart le&s;s Men; wherefore he pre|&s;ently betook him&s;elf to the march. Whe|ther it was becau&s;e the Prince had willingly, upon their req<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;t, undertaken this bu&s;ine&s;s, or that they did imagine <HI>Woerden</HI> would not be &s;o ea&s;ily taken, I know not: but &s;o it was, that hereupon they let not their Gal|lant Protector depart, without be&s;towing on him more new Te&s;timonies of their Kind|ne&s;s; wherefore they drew out a very con|&s;iderable &s;upply out of their Ships, with which that he might joyn, he went and en|camped at the head of a Pa&s;s between <HI>We&s;ep</HI> and <HI>Naerden,</HI> where he caus'd a &s;trong In|trenchment to be rais'd behind a great Ca|nale, and placed a guard on it.</P>
<P>Such preparations could not be made without the Duke of <HI>Luxemburgs</HI> know|ledge, for every body talk'd of them; and becau&s;e it &s;eem'd probable, their de&s;igns
<PB N="148" REF="76">were either again&s;t <HI>Naerden,</HI> which they had long threatned, or <HI>&V;trecht,</HI> towards which their march &s;eem'd to incline, he pre&s;ently drew out to prevent them.</P>
<P>This happened on the 8^t^h of <HI>October,</HI> for though they had long known of the Kings return into <HI>France,</HI> yet were they 2 or 3 months before they could &s;o recollect their &s;pirits as to think upon attempting any thing. The Duke therefore by 4 in the morning, leading with him 4000 Foot, and all his Hor&s;e, went and took up his po&s;t near the Pa&s;s through which the whole Dutch Army was to march; but this he did &s;o &s;uddenly, that he &s;urprized them; &s;o that their Van-guard, without &s;taying to di&s;cover who we were, betook them&s;elves to their heels with as much ha&s;t as if they had been already beaten, which gave our Van-guard occa&s;ion to laugh at them &s;ufficiently: yet with all their ha&s;te they could not e&s;cape &s;ome of our Dragoons, who flung them|&s;elves into the Cannel, which &s;erv'd them as a Baricado, and &s;wimming over killed di|vers of them, and took 40 Pri&s;oners ju&s;t be|fore the Intrenchment within which the whole Body of their Army lay, not one of them daring to &s;tir out to bring off their Companions; only they let fly &s;ome Vol|leys of Shot from their Canon, notwith|&s;tanding
<PB N="149" REF="76">which, our Men encamped them|&s;elves there.</P>
<P>The next day being the ninth, our Army, which had purpo&s;ely taken this po&s;t to ob|&s;erve their motions, was very intent all day upon that, and getting together &s;ome For|rage, without enterpri&s;ing any thing el&s;e: But the Hollanders lay not &s;o quiet as we, for they had been too long upon the defen|&s;ive part already, and therefore re&s;olv'd now to enter upon the offen&s;ive; 20 or 30 of their brave&s;t Fellows &s;eeing us lie &s;till, had a great mind to take our Forragers, who were as &s;ecurely at their work, as if they had been at the Gates of <HI>Paris,</HI> not thinking any body would dare to come and di&s;turb them. This their confidence gave the Enemy the better opportunity, who thereupon enclo&s;ed both the Men, Hor&s;es and Forrage. The truth is, the Sieur <HI>de la Rouillardiere,</HI> Captain of a Company of Dra|goons, and the Sieur <HI>Vieuxpont</HI> his Cornet, had been order'd to be their Convoy; but becau&s;e the extent of the Country, which they were to defend, was &s;omewhat large, they had divided them&s;elves, each taking 15 <HI>Mai&s;tres</HI> which they commanded; &s;o that they could not hinder the Enemies de&s;ign, neither did they oppo&s;e it, but &s;uffer'd all to be taken. Yet the Hollander had no rea|&s;on

<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="149" REF="77">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="130" REF="78">to brag of the Exploit; for our Captain and his Cornet, in&s;tead of coming towards them, left them ma&s;ters of the Field awhile, and wheeling a little about, joyn'd, and took up their po&s;t in a narrow pa&s;&s;age, by which they &s;aw the Enemy mu&s;t come with his prize, and there waited for them; where, after having &s;tood their fir&s;t di&s;charge, they made them all Pri&s;oners, not one e&s;caping, and brought them, and all the Forragers, back to our Camp. In the Evening, the Duke of <HI>Luxembourg</HI> gave order to his Men to be ready by the next Morning, re&s;olving, &s;eeing they &s;tirr'd not, to approach them nearer, and try if he could entice them out: and at the &s;ame time order'd a Ca|ptain of the <HI>Piedmont</HI> Regiment, with 12 Granadiers, to go and attaque them within their Barricado, and try if any of them &s;al|lyed out, to take &s;ome Pri&s;oners, whil&s;t he would be ready, in ca&s;e of need, to bring them off. The Captain perform'd what he was commanded very couragiou&s;ly, pa&s;t their fir&s;t Barricado without any re&s;i&s;tance, and march'd on to the &s;econd, where he found as little oppo&s;ition; and &s;eeing nothing but Men that fled, he advanc'd to the third, which chanc'd to be a Hou&s;e, &s;o he &s;et fire on that, and went on with intent to take &s;ome Pri|&s;oners if he could, as he had been ordered,
<PB N="141" REF="78">but he lo&s;t his labor; for the Dutchmen, notwith&s;tanding their pur&s;ie fat bulk, plyed their legs &s;o nimbly at this time, that it was not po&s;&s;ible for him to overtake one. Where|fore he return'd, and being to give account of what he had done, told the Duke, He had forc'd &amp; fired their Barricado's, and ran after the Enemy, but without being able to catch any, becau&s;e they flew, fear having put wings to their feet. The truth is, they never left running till they came to <HI>Boden|grave,</HI> &s;o that M. <HI>de Luxembourg</HI> finding there was likely to be no more action, re|turn'd to <HI>&V;trecht,</HI> where he was not long idle; for the Hollanders prepared more Lau|rels for him, as you &s;hall hear.</P>
<P>The tenth in the Morning they &s;et forward, and embarking upon the River to the num|ber of 14000, came and took up their po&s;t before <HI>Woerden,</HI> which the Prince caus'd pre&s;ently to be block'd up, hoping to &s;ur|pri&s;e the Garri&s;on, who indeed had no no|tice of their coming; but they not having been negligent in their duties, the bu&s;ine&s;s was not likely to be effected &s;o &s;oon as the Enemy hop'd, who now began to fear this little paltry Town would co&s;t them more then they imagined, wherefore they &s;pent the re&s;t of this, and all the following day, in Intrenching them&s;elves, and fortifying all
<PB N="152" REF="79">the Avenues to their Camp, e&s;pecially that part of it which lay towards <HI>&V;trecht,</HI> ima|gining if any &s;uccors came to the Town, it it would be from thence. In the mean time, the Count <HI>de la Mark</HI> took care to give no|tice to the Duke of <HI>Luxembourg,</HI> and not doubting but he would &s;peedily come to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, was &s;till upon the watch, ready to &s;ally forth and &s;et upon the Enemy on his &s;ide, as &s;oon as he &s;hould find &s;ome &s;uccors come to &s;econd him.</P>
<P>Upon this Intelligence, which came in a very ill time (becau&s;e the Duke of <HI>Luxem|bourg</HI> was then in the Field with &s;o &s;mall a party as could not be able to attempt any thing of them&s;elves, any one but he would have been &s;ufficiently puzled; but it was not then a time to &s;tand con&s;idering, where|fore he commanded tho&s;e that were with him to march on toward the be&s;ieged place, whil&s;t he went po&s;t to <HI>&V;trecht,</HI> where he or|dered the Marquis of <HI>Genlis</HI> to take all the Hor&s;e he had, and &s;ome Foot, and follow after with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed, ordering 2000 which were then ready to march immedi|atly, becau&s;e the danger being great requir'd a like remedy. The&s;e Orders were given mo&s;t prudently, and if they were not ac|cordingly executed, I can give no rea&s;on for it; but this I can certainly affirm, That the
<PB N="253" REF="79">Duke, being impatient till he got to the E|nemy, left all the&s;e Forces to be brought af|ter by Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Genlis,</HI> and put him&s;elf at the head of tho&s;e he had &s;ent before, when he fir&s;t receiv'd the news of the Siege; and the other 2000 Foot which he found ready, re&s;olving with this &s;mall party to &s;et upon the Enemy, and venture all, rather then &s;uf|fer the place to be lo&s;t &s;o under his no&s;e, with|out ever attempting any thing to &s;ave it.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be acknowledg'd that this Enter|prize was &s;trangely hazardous, and the happy i&s;&s;ue of it beyond belief. For it &s;eem'd morally impo&s;&s;ible, that our party &s;hould &s;wim over a River, and the Cau&s;eys being as good for the Hollander as &s;o many Rampires and Gabions; that they &s;hould rout an Army ten times as numerous as their own, and win a Fort from them furni&s;hed with five Intrenchments well flank'd and pallizado'd. Yet notwith&s;tanding all this, the Duke of <HI>Luxembourg</HI> having &s;taid a little for Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Genlis,</HI> and as long as was convenient to prepare him&s;elf for an attaque, began to &s;et on the Enemy, who in &s;pite of all his courage, and theirs that he command|ed, beat him twice back; but at the third On&s;et, the Marquis <HI>de Meilly</HI> gave the re&s;t a good example, by leaping into the Water up to his middle, which made many Offi|cers
<PB N="140" REF="80">and Voluntiers, and at la&s;t the whole party to do the like, and &s;o they pa&s;&s;ed over upon the very mouthes of the Enemies Guns, and got within their Intrenchments, which they were glad to quit and betake them&s;elves to &s;light, as their la&s;t and be&s;t re|fuge.</P>
<P>The Count <HI>de la Mark</HI> in the mean while, who as I &s;aid before, was &s;till ready to re|ceive the Enemy if he had a&s;&s;aulted the place, or to &s;ally out, if he &s;aw any likeli|hood of being a&s;&s;i&s;ted, being aware of the Duke of <HI>Luxembourgs</HI> arrival and attaque, lo&s;t no time, but &s;allyed out in per&s;on, and fell in among&s;t them like Lightning, killing many with his own hand, and being very well &s;econded by tho&s;e that followed him, who had before tryed the Enemies Courage in a Sally that 400 of them made at the be|ginning of the Siege, in which, driving the Enemy out of a part of the Suburbs where they had &s;heltred them&s;elves, the better to make their approaches, they fired it, and beat the Enemy out of three Intrenchments which they had made to hinder any &s;allies from the Town. The M. of <HI>Bois Dauphin</HI> was killed in this fir&s;t action, with &s;ix other Soldiers. So all their Intrench|ments, Banks, Canales, Sluces, Forts and
<PB N="145" REF="80">Redouts, wherewith they had fortified them|&s;elves, and all their Canon, were ob&s;tacles too weak to keep us out, for they were pre|&s;ently quite routed, and the Prince of <HI>O|range</HI> him&s;elf was forc'd to put all hopes of &s;afety in the fleetne&s;s of his Hor&s;e. But he was fortunate enough, not to be of the number of about 500 who were taken, and 800 &s;lain; among&s;t which were the Sieur <HI>Zule&s;tein,</HI> who had been Tutor to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and Colonel <HI>Bis</HI> his Steward; with 2 other Colonels, 3 Lieutenants, and about 70 or 80 Officers, be&s;ides a great many that were drown'd, and who&s;e num|ber could not be certainly known, but may be gue&s;t at by tho&s;e who were &s;ince taken up at divers places; which among the re&s;t, amounted to 50 in one little Canale.</P>
<P>Their flight was too &s;udden for them to think of any thing but &s;aving their lives, wherefore all their Baggage and Canon, which were nine Pieces, three of which were on Batteries again&s;t the Town, and the re&s;t within their Intrenchments, again&s;t any &s;uccor that might come to relieve it, fell in|to our hands. The&s;e were all put into the Town, and will be made u&s;e of to repul&s;e the Enemy again, if they dare ever attempt any thing again&s;t it.</P>
<PB N="156" REF="81">
<P>As there are no Ro&s;es without Prickles, nor great Plea&s;ures, which have not either accompanying or &s;oon following them &s;ome alloy of &s;orrow, &s;o this &s;trangely fortunate &s;ucce&s;s, could not be attain'd without &s;ome lo&s;s of our &s;ide. We lo&s;t in the Action ma|ny Soldiers, and among the Per&s;ons of Note were the Count <HI>de Meilly,</HI> the Colonel to the <HI>Normandy</HI> Regiment, and who commanded the Foot in this Service, the Sieur <HI>de la Til|hays</HI> his Lieutenant, a Gentleman of <HI>Nor|mandy,</HI> and the Sieur <HI>de Parville Tibout,</HI> a Voluntier of <HI>Normandy</HI> likewi&s;e, in the &s;ame Body. The M. <HI>de la Meylleraye,</HI> Co|lonel of the <HI>Piedmont</HI> Regiment. M. <HI>de Lar|diniere,</HI> Lieutenant Colonel of the <HI>Navarre</HI> Regiment, and the Chevalier <HI>de Boufflers,</HI> Colonel of the Regiment <HI>Royal</HI> of Dragoons were dangerou&s;ly wounded; be&s;ides divers Voluntiers who did wonders.</P>
<P>As the &s;ucce&s;s of &s;o perillous an Enter|pri&s;e could not but be very glorious to the Duke of <HI>Luxembourg,</HI> &s;o upon that account it did reward it &s;elf; but neither prov'd it le&s;s advantagious to him, then glorious. For the generous Monarch, for who&s;e &s;ervice it had been undertook, no &s;ooner heard of it, but with many Commendations be&s;tow'd on him, He pre&s;ently thought how he might re|compen&s;e it; and be&s;ides a great &s;um of
<PB N="157" REF="81">mony, &s;ent the Duke a Commi&s;&s;ion to be Captain of his Guards, in the &s;tead of the Marquis <HI>de Lauzun Peguilain,</HI> that he and all Men might thereby &s;ee, That no Man &s;erves him for nothing, That whatever is done for him, is pre&s;ently follow'd by its re|compence; and, That he better knows how to reward Virtue then puni&s;h Vice.</P>
<P>This fir&s;t E&s;&s;ay of the Hollanders, for the execution of which they had taken all po&s;&s;i|ble care, and done all that might a&s;&s;ure them of a good event, &s;ucceeding &s;o ill, was not however altogether u&s;ele&s;s to the Prince of <HI>Orange;</HI> who being made more cautious by his ill &s;ucce&s;s, re&s;olv'd from henceforward not to venture any thing, nor make the lea&s;t attempt where he was &s;ure to find any great oppo&s;ition. The States likewi&s;e began to di&s;cover how un&s;ea&s;onably they had put him upon this Siege. Wherefore, that he might not be forc'd to be always doing nothing, to which he was here reduc'd by the Duke of <HI>Luxembourg,</HI> who was &s;till at the heels of him, as &s;oon as he took the Field. He thought he might do &s;omthing to more purpo&s;e, if leaving Holland he went toward <HI>Liege,</HI> ei|ther again&s;t <HI>Tongres</HI> or <HI>Fouquemont,</HI> which were neither fortified, nor like to be &s;uccor'd by any Army that lay near them: for M. <HI>de Turenne</HI> was march'd after the Imperial and
<PB N="148" REF="82"><HI>Brandenbourg</HI> Forces, or el&s;e again&s;t <HI>Mae&s;iick,</HI> who&s;e Fortifications not being yet fini&s;h'd, would more ea&s;ily be taken. In this re&s;o|lution he cho&s;e out his be&s;t Troops, and mo&s;t experienc'd Commanders, in whom he chief|ly confided, and made up a Body of about 14000 or 15000 Men. And thus having given all nece&s;&s;ary Orders for the &s;ecurity of his Camp at <HI>Bodengrave,</HI> (which had hither|to been his retiring place in all his Misfor|tunes, and which having been fortifying it all the Summer, he had made a Bulwark for the &s;ecurity of all the re&s;t of <HI>Holland</HI>) he &s;et forward by the ways of <HI>Worcum, Gorcum,</HI> and <HI>Breda,</HI> de&s;igning to take with him a part of the Garri&s;on of this la&s;t nam'd Town, as well as tho&s;e of the <HI>Bu&s;&s;e, Berguen-op-Zoom,</HI> and <HI>Mae&s;tricht,</HI> to augment his Army; but did not execute what he intended, either be|cau&s;e he chang'd his mind, or becau&s;e he could not, the Garri&s;ons of tho&s;e places being for the mo&s;t part Spaniards. How|ever it were, it matters not, but <HI>Bommelle</HI> lying in his way, and that being a great rich Town, and one of the chief of tho&s;e that lie on the <HI>Wahal,</HI> he thought it would be no bad prize if he could compa&s;s it, and would be a happy beginning of his intended Pro|gre&s;s; wherefore he march'd thither, and began to make his approaches; but going
<PB N="141" REF="82">in Per&s;on to view it, he chanc'd to bleed at the No&s;e; which &s;eeming ominous, he would not ob&s;tinatly &s;tay any longer before it, but march'd &s;traight on to <HI>Tongres,</HI> with de&s;ign to &s;et upon that. But the Sieur <HI>Montal,</HI> Go|vernor of <HI>Charleroy,</HI> having had Orders from the King, who had intelligence of their de|&s;ign, to put &s;ome Soldiers into it; having done accordingly, &s;poil'd their de&s;ign. <HI>Mae|&s;iick</HI> would have been a better bit for them, but they were too dainty to &s;toop to &s;uch cour&s;e fair, and therefore went on towards <HI>Fouquemont,</HI> upon which the Prince vented all his fury, and took it with as much greedi|ne&s;s, as it had been defended generou&s;ly, by the Lieutenant Colonel of the <HI>Jonzac.</HI> Regi|ment, who was in it only with 200 Men, endur'd four A&s;&s;aults very bravely, but at la&s;t was forc'd to yield it up. After this, the Prince re&s;um'd his de&s;ign again&s;t <HI>Ton|gres,</HI> and march'd towards it; but let us leave him awhile to &s;ee what was done in the mean time in his own Country.</P>
<P>The Hollander had not &s;o much rea&s;on to rejoyce at the taking of <HI>Fouquemont,</HI> as they had of being &s;orrowful at the &s;ucce&s;s of our Arms, and tho&s;e of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Mun&s;ters</HI> in <HI>Fri&s;eland.</HI> The Count <HI>de Saulx,</HI> having been told by a certain Captain in his Regi|ment, who had learn'd it from &s;ome German

<PB N="160" REF="84">Fugitives from the Dutch Army, that the <HI>Bampfield</HI> Regiment lay at <HI>Hyle&s;tein</HI> in very ill plight, and that there was a way to come to them which was not well guarded, and who&s;e Fortifications were not capable of gi|ving us any &s;top, the Guard it &s;elf con&s;i&s;t|ing but of 40 or 50 Men, which lay a great way from the re&s;t within an Intrenchment beyond the Canale of <HI>Gorcum;</HI> and that their retreat might be cut off, not to lo&s;e any time, &s;ent &s;ome to take knowledge of the Po&s;t, and in the mean time gave intelligence of it to the Duke of <HI>Luxembourg,</HI> who was very glad of the news, but however expected the return of tho&s;e who were gon to take an ac|count of the place; who &s;oon returning, con|firm'd almo&s;t all that the German Fugitives had related. Hereupon the Count <HI>de Saulx</HI> received the Order which he had de&s;ir'd of marching thither; he had given him to that end 300 Men of his own Regiment, and 200 out of that of <HI>Ca&s;telnau,</HI> 50 Dragoons, and as many Hor&s;e, with Commi&s;&s;ion only to take all the party that were guarding that pa&s;&s;age, and not to venture, for fear of be|ing lo&s;t in going to the Enemies Quarters.</P>
<P>The 15 of <HI>November</HI> was the day which confer'd on him the glory he gain'd in this enterprize. He &s;et out about 3 of the clock after dinner, having at lea&s;t 100 Refor|mades
<PB N="161" REF="84">Officers that follow'd him as Vo|luntiers; and the fir&s;t thing he did, was to &s;end a Captain of his Regiment to go be|fore and &s;ecure the Avenues, that no intelli|gence might be given to the Enemy of the march. But he was but ju&s;t got beyond a place called <HI>Lexmende</HI> when he &s;aw the Ca|ptain return, who brought word, That the Enemy had certainly &s;melt the De&s;ign, be|ing &s;ince they were &s;ent, the number of the party was encreas'd, and they had made up a Barriere before their Intrenchment, where they had plac'd &s;ome of their new comers, whom he had &s;een reliev'd by others, and that the outward Guard &s;eem'd to con&s;i&s;t of about 10 Men.</P>
<P>This news encreas'd the joy of our brave Commander, who now &s;aw, that though he was confin'd to do nothing but carry away all that guarded that place, yet he now &s;hould carry away at lea&s;t twice as many; and that if he afterwards march'd on to the Enemies Quarters (as he intended) he &s;hould with more ea&s;e ma&s;ter them, &s;ince they had weak|ned them&s;elves by &s;ending this party to the others a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Wherefore he command|ed the &s;ame Captain, with his Company, to take only their Swords and leave their Fire|arms behind, that &s;o they might, if po&s;&s;ible, make the other party yield without noi&s;e,
<PB N="162" REF="85">lea&s;t the Alarm &s;hould be thereby given to the Enemies main Quarters. This was ve|ry well contriv'd, but the party proving to be Hor&s;e (which he knew not of his Scouts, who &s;aw none of their Hor&s;es) &s;ome of them gave notice to the re&s;t time enough for them (who had receiv'd very con&s;iderable &s;uccors upon the intelligence they receiv'd 2 hours before of the De&s;ign) to prepare them&s;elves to receive us.</P>
<P>So great an alteration was enough to have &s;ent the Count back as he came, but it did only heighten his courage, who thought him&s;elf now too far ingag'd to leave off &s;o, wherefore &s;eeing all his men de&s;iring nothing more then to engage, he continued his march, and within a little while came with|in Pi&s;tol-&s;hot of the Intrenchment. There were two ways which led to it, and gave him an opportunity to attaque it in two pla|ces at once, but one of them was hardly pa&s;&s;able upon the account of a Sluce five or &s;ix foot deep; yet notwith&s;tanding he re|&s;olv'd to make u&s;e of them both, and to that purpo&s;e mended the other a little fir&s;t, and then immediatly commanded the Grenadi|ers to advance and cut down the Palli&s;ados; but they not being able to perform it, becau&s;e of their thickne&s;s, he commanded the Offi|cers to climb over, which &s;ucceeded &s;o well,
<PB N="163" REF="85">that the Enemies, after a &s;hort re&s;i&s;tance, be|took them&s;elves to flight, and gain'd their Quarters where they &s;taid not long; for &s;ee|ing them&s;elves pur&s;ued, they &s;tole away without any noi&s;e of Drum or Trumpet, though they were 1000 or 1200 Men.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, that as the Enemies were always very vigorou&s;ly &s;et upon, &s;o was their Cowardize extraordinary, other|wi&s;e it had not been po&s;&s;ible 1200 Men &s;hould &s;uffer them&s;elves to be routed and beaten out of a Fort, which on one &s;ide was &s;trengthned by a great Canale that ran at the foot of it, and on the other by two rows of &s;trong Palli&s;ado's 7 Foot high, a Pa|rapet Canon proof, 8 foot high, with two pieces of Ordnance, which they had plac'd there upon notice of our De&s;ign; be&s;ides 3 Fregats upon the Canale, who with their Ca|non were to defend the Intrenchment.</P>
<P>The Marquis of <HI>Ca&s;tlenaw,</HI> who was one of the Voluntiers, after having kill'd three with his own hand, in the heat of the Action had his hand lifted up to have done as much to a fourth, but was prevented by a Musket|&s;hot, which &s;o &s;hatter'd his Arm, that it was fain to be cut off; and afterwards, notwith|&s;tanding all the Chirurgions care, gangrend, &s;o that he dyed of it &s;ome days after at <HI>&V;|trecht,</HI> and was much lamented by all, as one

<P>The &s;ame day being the 15^t^h, the Marquis <HI>de Mou&s;&s;is,</HI> Colonel of the <HI>Queens</HI> Regiment, having been order'd to go and beat up a par|ty of the Enemy Quarter'd near <HI>We&s;ep,</HI> went accordingly with 300 Men, drawn out of the Garri&s;on of <HI>Naerden;</HI> but he found no body, for they had retir'd upon notice of his march, &s;o they fired the Village which they had quitted.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time the Enemy took a fan&s;ie to attaque a place in <HI>Frizeland,</HI> whether they went with 5000 Hor&s;e and 300 Foot, and not having been able to &s;urprize it as they hop'd, they laid &s;o formal a Siege to it, that it la&s;ted too long to their misfortune. For the Marquis <HI>Reinel,</HI> Camp-ma&s;ter to a party of Hor&s;e of the Confederate Forces, hear|ing of it, got together all the Men he could in ha&s;t, and went to its relief, where he broke through their Lines, getting into the Camp among them, killed many, routed the re&s;t, and gain'd all their baggage.</P>
<P>The Elector of <HI>Brandenbourg,</HI> their Pro|tector, had no better fortune then they, or

<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Sainfandaux</HI> at this time Fora|ging about the Country with 20 or 25 <HI>Mai|&s;tres,</HI> was betraid by a Pea&s;ant who was his Guide, into the Hands of a party of theirs, con&s;i&s;ting of 800, where after a long and brave re&s;i&s;tance, he was at length over|power'd by numbers, wounded, and carry|ed away Pri&s;oner. This was done before any Declaration of War from that Elector, but this act of Ho&s;tility was not long with|out Reprizals. Mon&s;ieur <HI>Turenne</HI> hearing they had left 100 Hor&s;e for the Guard of the Bridge, by which they had pa&s;s'd over the <HI>Main,</HI> &s;ent 150 <HI>Mai&s;tres</HI> of the Kings hou&s;|hold, under the command of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Brizac,</HI> Lieutenant of the Life-guards, to take cognizance of them, and di&s;cover whi|ther what had been done was out of &s;ome particular grudge to M. <HI>Saint&s;andoux,</HI> or that they intended an open War. He went ac|cordingly, and having found the Bridge guarded as he had been informed, advanc'd towards the Commander in chief, and after having ask'd who they were for, demanded free pa&s;&s;age, which was granted him: after|wards he demanded Quarters in the neigh|boring Hou&s;es, whereupon the Officer told him, That being there was not &s;uf|ficient room to quarter both parties in,
<PB N="166" REF="87">there was no rea&s;on he who had fir&s;t taken up the Quarters &s;hould be turn'd out of them; this &s;atisfied him as to that point, he having no de&s;ign to quarter there, wherefore M. <HI>Brizac</HI> ask'd him if he would &s;end for &s;ome Wine, &s;aying, They mu&s;t needs drink a Bottle together: but the German &s;melling a de&s;ign of making him &s;peak more in his drink then he was minded to do now he was &s;ober, replyed, He had already drunk his Mornings draught; and that if they mu&s;t needs drink to one another, it mu&s;t be at a di&s;tance: whereupon Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Brizac</HI> commanded his Men to advance, &s;aying, Why then you are not our Friends? and &s;o &s;ell on and defeated them. A part of whom were kill'd in the Encounter, and the re&s;t were either taken, or &s;aved them&s;elves by flight, &s;o that our Men became ma&s;ters of the Bridge; but Mon&s;ieur <HI>Brizac</HI> having had no order to keep it, came back with his party.</P>
<P>The keeping of this Bridge was of main con&s;equence to the Duke of <HI>Brandenbourg,</HI> both upon the account of his Intere&s;t and Ho|nor: it being the way by which he was to retire, in ca&s;e of ill &s;ucce&s;s; and he having bragg'd and promis'd he would maintain it. Wherefore, having been told by tho&s;e who had fled, that they had been defeated by one
<PB N="167" REF="87">only Squadron, imagining we &s;hould have kept the &s;ame po&s;t, he &s;ent 2000 Men to take it from us; but we &s;aved them a labor, becau&s;e we thought it not worth keeping. But it &s;eems they were not of our mind, for tho&s;e 2000 Men &s;trongly entrenched them&s;elves at the end of the Bridge, and &s;et|ing a &s;trong guard there, di&s;pos'd of them|&s;elves as well as they could in the Quarters thereabout, but with order to be ever upon their guard, becau&s;e they fore&s;aw that as long as Mon&s;ieur <HI>Turenne</HI> lay &s;o near them, he would not fail frequently to vi&s;it them.</P>
<P>They were not out in their conjectures, for Mon&s;ieur <HI>Turenne</HI> having had notice of their being his neighbors, two days after their return thither, and imagining they were come thither with a de&s;ign not to for|&s;ake the place without engaging, took with him the Kings Hou&s;hold, and march'd to|wards them with all &s;peed, to take cogni|zance of them him&s;elf, being re&s;olv'd once more to beat them from that po&s;t.</P>
<P>He had not march'd far, when being yet above three quarters of a mile &s;hort of the Bridge, pa&s;&s;ing thorow a Wood he met the Count <HI>d'Onak,</HI> a near Kin&s;man to the Duke of <HI>Brandenbourg,</HI> who being out upon a de|&s;ign of getting intelligence, hearing &s;ome Dogs which had follow'd our party, and
<PB N="168" REF="88">were hunting in the Wood, he follow'd the Cry till he came near our Van-guard, and hearing a noi&s;e of Men and Hor&s;es, came on towards us, but found other kind of Hunters then he was aware of, for he &s;oon perceived they were our Troops by their marching in rank and file; he came up to us notwith&s;tanding very re&s;olutly, and having ask'd who we were for, let fly at us fir&s;t; who returning the &s;ame &s;alute, wounded him in five or &s;ix places, whereof he dyed on the place cur&s;ing and &s;wearing: part of his followers, which were 15 or 16 in all, were taken Pri&s;oners, and the re&s;t fled to the Bridge, where they put the whole party in &s;uch a fright, that M. <HI>Turenne</HI> at his arri|val found it de&s;erted.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the worthy Exploits the Hol|lander and their Partizans perform'd at home, whil&s;t the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> rang'd a|bout in the Country of <HI>Liege,</HI> with intent to &s;urprize &s;ome place on that &s;ide. He went to &s;et upon <HI>Liege</HI> it &s;elf, but &s;taid not long before it: but becau&s;e <HI>Tongres,</HI> and the Gar|ri&s;on there had done him much mi&s;chief, he had a great &s;pight at it, and was alway fra|ming &s;ome de&s;ign again&s;t it. After the ta|king of <HI>Fouquemont,</HI> he re&s;olv'd to be&s;iege it in good earne&s;t; and it was in his march to|wards it that we left him but now, and there|fore
<PB N="169" REF="88">we will now pur&s;ue our di&s;cour&s;e of him, and &s;ee how his de&s;ign &s;ped. But if we would have found him before the Place, we mu&s;t have return'd &s;ooner, for though he came thither with intent to &s;it down before it, yet Count <HI>Mar&s;in</HI> made the pro|ject mi&s;carry, who (&s;eing though the Place was not over well fortified, yet the Garri&s;on in it was very &s;trong, and might defend them&s;elves very long, and co&s;t a great many lives to winn it, M. <HI>de Montal</HI> being in the Place, who doubtle&s;s would maintain it to the la&s;t), advi&s;ed him not to pur&s;ue the de|&s;ign any farther.</P>
<P>This advice which was well grounded, &s;ugge&s;ted to them another more likely pro|ject, and the i&s;&s;ue of which would be of much more con&s;equence. Mon&s;ieur <HI>Montal</HI> being now in <HI>Tongres,</HI> whether he was come and had brought with him a great party of men to reinforce the Garri&s;on, made them judge <HI>Charleroy,</HI> who&s;e Governour he was, and out of which he had drawn tho&s;e men, might ea&s;ily be gained, both upon the ac|count of the Governours ab&s;ence, and thin|ne&s;s of the Garri&s;on, which they imagin'd was much weakened by the party that M. <HI>de Montal</HI> had thence carried with him to <HI>Tongres:</HI> upon the&s;e grounds, they re&s;olv'd to be&s;iege it, and gave Count <HI>Monterey</HI>
<PB N="170" REF="89">notice of their de&s;ign, to oblige him con&s;i|dering the importance of the Place, to &s;end them more Forces; which, it &s;eems, he too carefully and zealou&s;ly did. For he unfurni&s;h|ed many of his Towns to make up a body of 16000, which was directly contrary to the Treaty at the <HI>Pyrenaeans</HI> and <HI>Aix la Chappelle.</HI></P>
<P>The 15 of <HI>December</HI> the Count <HI>Mar&s;in,</HI> who commanded that Body, went and &s;at down before the Place in expectation of the Prince who was to follow with his Army.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Sieur <HI>de Montal</HI> being inform'd of the de&s;ign by &s;ome pri|&s;oners, and by 50 <HI>Mai&s;tres,</HI> whom he had ordered to follow the Enemy at a di&s;tance and ob&s;erve their motions, (though he could hardly beleive they would venture upon &s;o great and difficult a bu&s;ine&s;s) yet &s;ent intel|ligence of it to the Court (as they al&s;o did from <HI>Charleroy</HI>) withal de&s;iring a Commi&s;|&s;ion to return, and get into the Town; which he immediatly prepared him&s;elf to do, without &s;taying for orders, &s;o &s;oon as he &s;hould be &s;ure they were re&s;olved upon the Siege of that Place.</P>
<P>The 16 Mon&s;ieur de <HI>S. Cla</HI> a Brigadier of Hor&s;e, hearing of the &s;ame de&s;ign at <HI>Mae&s;iick</HI> where he then was, went thence accompanied by the <HI>Sieurs de S. Sylve&s;tre,</HI> and <HI>d'Arty</HI> Captains of Hor&s;e, the <HI>Sieurs

<P>The news they brought, was &s;o extra|ordinary, and it &s;eem'd &s;o improbable that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> &s;hould come into <HI>Fland|ers</HI> to be&s;iege one of our principal Places there, that had not all the 3 Couriers &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively confirmed what had been related, of the Count <HI>Monterey</HI>'s drawing out 15000 or 1600 men out of his Garri&s;ons, and
<PB N="172" REF="90">&s;ending them to begin the Siege, the <HI>Couriers</HI> would have been laught at as mad men, rather then beleiv'd; be&s;ides that after all, there was another rea&s;on that added to the improbability of it, which was the viola|tion of the Treaty, which after this Count <HI>Monterey</HI> could not excu&s;e.

As M. <HI>de Louvoys</HI> is a man of excellent conduct and fore&s;ight in mana|ging bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;o is he indefatigable when their is need of di&s;patch, he therefore &s;et out at midnight as &s;oon as he had his orders, and having &s;ent to the Chevalier <HI>de Nogent</HI> to accompany him, went by <HI>Peronne,</HI> and thence to <HI>Athe.</HI> The Mar&s;hal <HI>d'Humieres</HI> likewi&s;e though he had kept his bed three days before, being tormented by the Colick, &s;et out immediatly for <HI>Li&s;le.</HI> As to Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Montal,</HI> he took the &s;ame way along the Cau&s;&s;ey, by which the Enemy had march'd before him, that &s;o he might not be di&s;co|vered: he had not marched above 5 or 6 hours, before he overtook &s;ome of the rear
<PB N="173" REF="90">of their Army loitering behind, all which he &s;trip'd and hamme-&s;tring'd their hor&s;es, that they might not follow nor give notice of his march.</P>
<P>The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">8 before day he came pretty near the Enemy, 1500 or 1600 of who&s;e foot were quartered in a Village call'd <HI>Perruis,</HI> and all the hor&s;e who conveyed them were di&s;po&s;ed of in other Villages along the Cau&s;|&s;ey, as far as <HI>Giblow;</HI> all the&s;e he pa&s;&s;ed without being di&s;covered, but coming nearer <HI>Charleroy,</HI> was aware of other Troops, whom to avoid he was forced to turn out of his way, and fetch a compa&s;s on the right hand to gain the Woods.</P>
<P>All this was don in the night, and at day break he arrived within &s;ight of their Camp, but there made a halt, not being willing to appear till their guards were releiv'd, lea&s;t when he would have forced his pa&s;&s;age, all the whole Army &s;hould be upon his back, which &s;ucceeded as he could have wi&s;h'd.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t body of Men he came at, after coming out of the Woods, was a Regiment of Spani&s;h foot, among&s;t whom he intruded &s;o far, before they were aware of it, that though they began to &s;u&s;pect him, yet they dared not give the Alarm, but on the con|trary &s;aluted him civilly, and he returned them the like.</P>

<P>If Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Montal</HI> had found all the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Hollanders</HI> of the &s;ame oblig|ing and civil temper, he would certainly have ever after commended their good breeding, and found no u&s;e for the &s;words which he and all his party carried ready drawn under their cloakes. But that would not be, for as he came near a Gla&s;s-hou&s;e where a great many were quartered, as well as in all the out-hou&s;es thereabouts, &s;ome body having &s;pied their naked &s;words, cryed to Arms, &s;aying they were Enemies, and thereupon they &s;hot at them from every part, becau&s;e they &s;till marched on, not minding what was don; but by this time the Alarm was every where &s;pread, and it was time for our men to think of defending them|&s;elves, which they did &s;o much the more ea&s;ily becau&s;e the Enemies Hor&s;e-guard, which con&s;i&s;ted of 150 <HI>Mai&s;tres,</HI> and were po&s;ted between the Town and Camp had newly unbridled their hor&s;es, &s;o that not above 70 or 80 were found ready, who came upon us and were mo&s;t of them killed, a|mong&s;t whom was he that lead them call'd <HI>Floris Major,</HI> who was in great repute a|mong&s;t them. 13 or 14 of our party were either killed or taken, whom we &s;taid not to releive, lea&s;t by &s;o doing we &s;hould have lo&s;t the favorable opportunity of getting in|to
<PB N="175" REF="91"><HI>Charleroy,</HI> for if we had ob&s;tinatly &s;taid to di&s;engage them, it may be the whole Army had fall'n upon us.

<P>The Place was clo&s;e be&s;et by the Enemy, who lay within Carrabine &s;hot of it, yet without attemting any thing upon the out|works: The truth is M. <HI>de Franclieu,</HI> the Kings Lieutenant in that Place, who com|manded in cheif during the Governors ab|&s;ence, had done every thing that was po&s;|&s;ible, and applied all imaginable diligence, to put all things in the be&s;t po&s;ture that could be, in ca&s;e they &s;hould be attaqu'd. Mon&s;ieur <HI>Desbonnais,</HI> a Brigadier of foot, who by good chance had &s;taid there, did likewi&s;e much contribute to it, as did the <HI>Sieur Terrade,</HI> an Engineer, who took on him the care of the works: &s;o that every body &s;trove who &s;hould &s;hew mo&s;t zeal for his Maje&s;ty's and their Country's &s;ervice, there being no body who de&s;erv'd not much commendation on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Montal</HI> was ar|rived he took care that all things &s;hould be
<PB N="176" REF="92">ordered to the be&s;t advantage, and finding that the party of hor&s;e which he had brought with him, might be very &s;erviceable to him again&s;t the Enemy, and likewi&s;e very trouble|&s;ome to the Place if their Forrage began to fail, he &s;ent out 50 of them to defend 150 Musketeers, commanded by the <HI>Sieur Des|bonnais,</HI> whil&s;t they &s;hould get together all the Forrage they could find all along the <HI>Sambre,</HI> in the mo&s;t remote hou&s;es, this was 3 houres doing, and had been &s;ooner perform'd had not the Enemy &s;trove to oppo&s;e it, and &s;o hinder'd our men from returning &s;o &s;oon as otherwi&s;e they might. And yet we lo&s;t nothing by the bargain, for our men beat the Enemy on this occa&s;ion from a Po&s;t which they kept with a con&s;iderable guard of hor&s;e and foot, and killed many of them, we loo&s;ing but 2 Soldiers in all the Action.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t all this went on &s;o gloriou&s;ly, e|very body was &s;everaly employed in the Town, M. <HI>de Montal</HI> betook him&s;elf to di&s;|cover the de&s;igns of the Enemy, and having ob&s;erved a Battery which they were rai&s;ing upon a ri&s;ing ground that lay before the two little ponds, where the works chanced no to be coated, nor quite fini&s;h'd; he judg'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> they would make their cheif attaque on that &s;ide, which made him particularly provid for the &s;ecurity of that quarter, that h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">

The <HI>Sieurs de Franclieu</HI> and <HI>Desbonnais</HI> placed them&s;elves where they thought they might do the be&s;t &s;ervice in their own per&s;ons.</P>
<P>But the Enemy, who by this time di&s;co|vered from their Camp, which lay very near, that they &s;hould not ea&s;ily carry the Place, began to flinch, and abate much of their fury; &s;o that the night following, in&s;tead of a&s;&s;aulting the Town, as they ought to have done, they di&s;continued their Battery, &s;o that on the 19 in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> he morning Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Montal</HI> ob&s;erving this, re&s;olved to &s;end out all his Hor&s;e, with orders to &s;ally out upon the high ground that lay towards <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> and to line the Counter&s;carpe, and out|works with all his Mu&s;queteers, that &s;o they might get &s;ome pri&s;oners.

The Duke of <HI>Luxembourg</HI> immediatly commanded them all to be fired, not &s;paring &s;o much as that of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> in which many Men, Goods and Cattel were burn'd, to be reveng'd of him for a&s;&s;aulting the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Marimont,</HI> one of the Kings Hou&s;es of Plea&s;ure, which had been yielded him at the Treaty of <HI>Aix la Chapelle.</HI></P>
<P>After &s;o many Toils, Perils, and &s;o much Execution done, one would have thought it would have been but rea&s;onable to give the Soldiery a little re&s;t; and truly had they de|&s;ired it, they could not in rea&s;on have been denyed it. But it is to be admired, that
<PB N="185" REF="96">the Soldiers march'd on of their own accord, till they came to <HI>Bodengrave,</HI> where they found not that re&s;i&s;tance which they expe|cted, for the Count <HI>Koningsmark</HI> had quitted it with all his Troops.</P>
<P>At <HI>Compeigne</HI> their Maje&s;ties being certifi|ed of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s retreat, re&s;olv'd to return to St. <HI>Germains.</HI></P>
<P>The 29. Orders were given at <HI>Compeigne</HI> for their Maje&s;ties departure, and prepara|tions made to &s;et forward on the 31.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Luxembourg,</HI> who &s;taid a|while at <HI>Bodengrave,</HI> to give his brave Sol|diers a little re&s;t and refre&s;hment, found him|&s;elf nece&s;&s;itated to march on yet further: for being inform'd that &s;ome of tho&s;e whom he had routed the day before, had not dar'd to &s;tay at <HI>Niverburg,</HI> and by their fright &s;o infected all tho&s;e that kept the Garri&s;on (which was mo&s;t advant giou&s;ly fortifyed) that they had all for&s;aken it; he thought him&s;elf oblig'd to march thither: where at his coming he found no living &s;oul, only 21 pieces of Canon, 8 of Iron, and 13 of Bra&s;s fell into his hands, which he &s;ent to <HI>Boden|grave,</HI> to be &s;ecur'd by his Foot, which were
<PB N="186" REF="97">left there, the Hor&s;e and Dragoons having been all left at <HI>Woerden.</HI></P>
<P>After this, the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> took his way homewards, having had as ill &s;ucce&s;s in <HI>Flanders</HI> and the Country of <HI>Liege,</HI> as in Holland. And becau&s;e Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Duras</HI> lay between <HI>Tongres</HI> and <HI>Charleroy,</HI> and had po&s;&s;e&s;t all the ways by which the Prince was to return, he was forc'd to go a great way a|bout, to avoid meering any of the French Forces, which he dreaded above all things.</P>
<P>The 31. their Maje&s;ties left <HI>Compiegne</HI> a|bout 9 in the Morning, and came that night to <HI>Senlis,</HI> from whence they went on the fir&s;t of <HI>January,</HI> 1673. after the Queen had been at her Devotions, and lay that night at the <HI>Louvre</HI> in <HI>Paris,</HI> from whence they went to St. <HI>Germain en Laye.</HI></P>
