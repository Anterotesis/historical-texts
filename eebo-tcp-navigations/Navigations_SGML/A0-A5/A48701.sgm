<DIV1 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>Introduction to the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>THis Tract was Written chiefly to &s;atisfie my own Curio&s;ity, and
to delight my &s;elf with the Memory of what I had &s;een. I bu&s;ied my &s;elf
in a place where I had little to do, but to walk up and down; well knowing,
that the Character of a Stranger gave me free admittance to Men and Things. The
French Nation value them&s;elves upon Civility, and build and dre&s;s mo&s;tly
for Figure; This Humour <PB N="2" REF="8">makes the Curio&s;ity of Strangers
very ea&s;ie and welcome to them.</P>
<P>But why do you trouble us with a Journey to <HI>Paris,</HI> a place
&s;o well known to every body here? For very good Rea&s;on, to &s;pare the
often telling my Tale at my return. But we know al|ready all you can &s;ay, or
can read it in the <HI>Pre&s;ent State of France,</HI> and <HI>De&s;cription of
Paris;</HI> two Books to be had in every Shop in <HI>London;</HI> 'Tis right,
&s;o you may; and I advi&s;e you not to neglect them, if you have a mind to
judge well of the Grandeur of the Court of <HI>France,</HI> and the immen&s;e
Greatne&s;s of the City of <HI>Paris.</HI> The&s;e were Spectacles I did
in|deed put on, but I found they did not fit my &s;ight, I had a mind to &s;ee
with|out them; and in Matters of this Na|ture, as va&s;t Cities and va&s;t
Palaces, I did not care much to u&s;e Micro&s;copes or Mag|nifying
Gla&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>But to content you, Reader, I pro|mi&s;e you not to trouble you with
Cere|monies either of State or Church, or Po|liticks; for I entred willingly
into nei|ther of them, but only, where they would make a part of the
Conver&s;ation, or my Walk was ordered me. You'l ea&s;ily find by my
Ob&s;ervations, that I in|cline rather to Nature than Dominion; 
<PB N="3" REF="8">and that I took more plea&s;ure to &s;ee Mon&s;ieur
<HI>Breman</HI> in his white Wa&s;tcoat digging in the Royal Phy&s;ick Garden,
and &s;owing his Couches, than Mon&s;ieur <HI>Saintot</HI> making room for an
Amba&s;&s;ador; and I found my &s;elf better di&s;po&s;ed, and more apt to
learn the Names and Phy&s;i|ognomy of a Hundred Plants, than of 5 or 6 Princes.
After all, I had much rather have walked a 100 paces under the meane&s;t Hedge
in <HI>Languedoc,</HI> than any the fine&s;t Alley at <HI>Ver&s;ailles</HI> or
<HI>St. Clou,</HI> &s;o much I prefer fair Nature and a warm Sun, before the
mo&s;t exqui&s;ite perfor|mances of Art in a cold and barren Climate.</P>
<P>Another Rea&s;on, that I give you little or no trouble in telling
you Court Mat|ters, is, that I was no more concerned in the Emba&s;&s;y, than
in the &s;ailing of the Ship which carried me over: 'Tis enough for me, with
the re&s;t of the People of <HI>England,</HI> to feel the good Ef|fects of it,
and to pa&s;s away this Life in Peace and Quietne&s;s. 'Tis a happy turn for
us, when Kings are made Friends again. This was the end of this Emba&s;|&s;y,
and I hope it will la&s;t our days. My Lord Amba&s;&s;ador was infinitely
care&s;&s;ed by the King, his Mini&s;ters, and all the Princes. 'Tis certain
the French are the <PB N="4" REF="9">mo&s;t Polite Nation in the World, and can
Prai&s;e and Court with a better Air than the re&s;t of Mankind. However the
generality of the Kingdom were through great nece&s;&s;ity well di&s;po&s;ed to
receive the Peace: The Bigots and &s;ome Di&s;|banded Officers might be heard
at our fir&s;t going to grumble, but tho&s;e al&s;o gave over, and we heard no
more of them when we came away; but to the Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>I happily arrived at <HI>Paris</HI> after a te|dious Journey in very
bad Weather; for we &s;et out of <HI>London</HI> the 10th of <HI>December,</HI>
and I did not reach <HI>Paris</HI> till the fir&s;t of <HI>January;</HI> for I
fell &s;ick upon the Road, and &s;tay'd 5 days at <HI>Bologne,</HI> be|hind the
Company, till my Fever abat|ed; yet notwith&s;tanding &s;o rude a Jour|ney, I
recovered, and was perfectly cured of my Cough in 10 days; which was the
chiefe&s;t rea&s;on of my leaving <HI>London</HI> at that time of the year, and
never had the lea&s;t return of it all the Winter, though it was as fierce
there as I ever felt it in <HI>England.</HI> This great be|nefit of the
<HI>French</HI> Air I had experien|ced 3 &s;everal times before, and had
there|fore long'd for a pa&s;&s;age many years; but the continuance of the War
was an in&s;uperable Ob&s;tacle to my De&s;ires. <PB N="5" REF="9">Therefore
the fir&s;t opportunity which offered it &s;elf I readily embraced, which was
my Lord <HI>Portland</HI>'s Acceptance of my Attendance of him in his
Extraordi|nary Emba&s;&s;ie; who ordered me to go before with one of my good
Friends, who was &s;ent to prepare Matters again&s;t his arrival.</P>
<P>Now that I might not wholly tru&s;t my Memory, in what I &s;aw at
<HI>Paris,</HI> I &s;et down my Thoughts under certain Heads.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>I. Of <HI>Paris</HI> in General.</HEAD>
<P>THough I had much &s;pare time the 6 Months I &s;taid in that City,
yet the rudene&s;s of the Winter Sea&s;on kept me in for &s;ome time. Again, I
believe I did not &s;ee the Tithe of what de&s;erves to be &s;een, and well
con&s;idered; becau&s;e for many things I wanted a reli&s;h, par|ticularly for
Painting and Building; However I viewed the City in all its parts, and made the
round of it; took &s;everal pro&s;pects of it at a di&s;tance, which when well
thought on, I mu&s;t needs confe&s;s it to be one of the mo&s;t Beauti|ful and
Magnificent in <HI>Europe,</HI> and in which a Traveller might find Novelties
enough f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">r 6 Months for daily
Enter|tainment, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> lea&s;t in and
about this <PB N="6" REF="10">Noble City. To give therefore a &s;trict and
general Idea of it, and not to enter far into the vain Di&s;putes of the number
of Inhabitants, or its bigne&s;s, compared to <HI>London;</HI> &s;ure I am, the
<HI>&s;tanding Croud</HI> was &s;o great, when my Lord Amba&s;&s;a|dor made his
Entry, that our People were &s;trartled at it, and were ready the next day to
give up the Que&s;tion, had they not well con&s;idered the great Cu|rio&s;ity
of the <HI>Pari&s;ians,</HI> who are much more delighted in fine Shews than the
People of <HI>London,</HI> and &s;o were well near all got into the way of the
Cavalcade. One thing was an evident Argument of this Humour, that there were
&s;ome Hun|dreds of Coaches of Per&s;ons of the be&s;t Quality, even &s;ome
Bi&s;hops and Peers which I &s;aw, which had placed them|&s;elves in a file to
line the Streets, and had had the patience to have &s;o remained for &s;ome
hours.</P>
<P>'Tis al&s;o mo&s;t certain, that for the quantity of Ground
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Common People, this City is much more populous than
any part of <HI>London;</HI> here are from 4 to 5 and to 10 Menages, or
di&s;tinct Families in many Hou&s;es; but this is only to be under&s;tood of
certain places of Trade. This difference betwixt the two Cities al&s;o is true,
that here the <PB N="7" REF="10">Palaces and Convents have eat up the Peoples
Dwellings, and crouded them exce&s;&s;ively together, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
them|&s;elves of far the greate&s;t part of the Ground; whereas in
<HI>London</HI> the con|trary may be ob&s;erved, that the People have
de&s;troyed the Palaces, and placed them&s;elves upon the Foundations of them,
and forced the Nobility to live in Squares or Streets in a &s;ort of
Commu|nity; but this they have done very ho|ne&s;tly, having fairly purcha&s;ed
them.</P>
<P>The Views al&s;o which it gives upon the River are admirable; that
of the <HI>Pont-neuf</HI> downwards to the <HI>Tuilleries,</HI> or upwards from
the <HI>Pont-Royal;</HI> and in &s;ome other places, as from <HI>Pont St.
Ber|nard,</HI> the <HI>Greve, &amp;c.</HI> The River <HI>Seine</HI> which
pa&s;&s;es through the mid&s;t of the City, is all nobly Bank'd or Keyed with
large Free&s;tone; and inclo&s;es in the heart of the City two I&s;lands, which
cau&s;es many fine Bridges to be built to pa&s;s over them. One of the&s;e
I&s;lands called <HI>l'I&s;le de Palais</HI> was all <HI>Paris</HI> for &s;ome
Ages.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;es are built of hewen Stone intirely, or whited over with
Plai&s;ter: &s;ome indeed in the beginning of this Age are of Brick with
Free&s;tone, as the <HI>Place-Royal, Place-Dauphin, &amp;c.</HI> but that is 
<PB N="8" REF="11">wholly left off now; and the white Plai&s;ter is in &s;ome
few places only co|loured after the fa&s;hion of Brick, as part of the Abbay of
<HI>St. Germain.</HI> The Hou&s;es every where are high and &s;tately; The
Churches numerous, but not very big; The Towers and Steeples but few in
proportion to the Churches, yet that noble way of Steeple, the <HI>Domes</HI>
or <HI>Cu|polas,</HI> have a marvellous effect in pro|&s;pect; though they are
not many, as that of <HI>Val de Grace, des Invalides, Col|lege Mazarin, De
l'A&s;&s;umption,</HI> the <HI>Grand-Je&s;uits, La Sorbonne,</HI> and &s;ome
few o|thers.</P>
<P>All the Hou&s;es of Per&s;ons of Di&s;tin|ction are built with
<HI>Port-cochers,</HI> that is, wide Gates to drive in a Coach, and
con&s;equently have Courts within; and mo&s;tly <HI>Remi&s;es</HI> to &s;et
them up. There are reckoned above 700 of the&s;e great Gates; and very many of
the&s;e are af|ter the mo&s;t noble Patterns of ancient Architecture.</P>
<P>The lower Windows of all Hou&s;es are Grated with &s;trong Bars of
Iron; which mu&s;t be a va&s;t Expence.</P>
<P>As the Hou&s;es are magnificent without, &s;o the Fini&s;hing within
&s;ide and Furni|ture an&s;wer in Riches and Neatne&s;s; as Hangings of rich
Tape&s;try, rai&s;ed with <PB N="9" REF="11">Gold and Silver Threads, Crim&s;on
Da|mask and Velvet Beds or of Gold and Silver Ti&s;&s;ue. <HI>Cabinets</HI> and
<HI>Bureaus,</HI> of Ivory inlaid with Tortoi&s;hell, and Gold and Silver
Plates in a 100 different manners: Branches and Candle&s;ticks of Cry&s;tal:
but above all mo&s;t rare Pictures. The Gild|ings, Carvings and Paintings of
the Roof are admirable.</P>
<P>The&s;e things are in this City and the Country about to &s;uch a
variety and ex|ce&s;s, that you can come into no private Hou&s;e of any Man of
Sub&s;tance, but you &s;ee &s;omething of them; and they are ob&s;erved
frequently to ruine them&s;elves in the&s;e Expences. Every one, that has any
thing to &s;pare, covets to have &s;ome good Picture or Sculpture of the be&s;t
Arti&s;t; The like in the Ornaments of their Gardens, &s;o that it is
incredible what plea&s;ure that va&s;t quantity of fine things give the Curious
Stranger. Here as &s;oon as ever a Man gets any thing by Fortune or
Inheritance, he lays it out in &s;ome &s;uch way as now named.</P>
<P>Yet after all many Uten&s;ils and Con|veniencies of Life are wanting
here, which we in <HI>England</HI> have: This makes me remember what Mon&s;ieur
<HI>Ju&s;tell,</HI> a <HI>Pari&s;ian</HI> formerly, told me here, that he had
made a Catalogue of near Three&s;core <PB N="10" REF="12">Things of this Nature
which they wanted in <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>The Pavement of the Streets is all of &s;quare Stone, of about 8 or
10 Inches thick; that is, as deep in the ground as they are broad at top; The
Gutters &s;hal|low, and laid round without edges, which makes the Coaches glide
ea&s;ily over them.</P>
<P>However, it mu&s;t needs be &s;aid, the Streets are very narrow, and
the Pa&s;&s;en|gers a-foot no ways &s;ecured from the hur|ry and danger of
Coaches, which always pa&s;s the Streets with an air of ha&s;te; and a full
trot upon broad flat Stones, betwixt high and large re&s;ounding Hou&s;es,
makes a &s;ort of Mu&s;ick which &s;hould &s;eem very agreeable to the
<HI>Pari&s;ians.</HI></P>
<P>The Royal Palaces are &s;urpri&s;ingly &s;tately; as the
<HI>Louvre</HI> and <HI>Tuilliries, Pa|lais Luxembourg, Palais Royal.</HI></P>
<P>The Convents are great, and numerous, and well built; as <HI>Val de
Grace, St. Ger|mains, St. Victor, St. Genevieve,</HI> the <HI>Grand Je&s;uits,
&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Squares are few in <HI>Paris,</HI> but ve|ry beautiful; as the
<HI>Place Royal, Place Victoir, Place Dauphine,</HI> none of the large&s;t,
except the <HI>Place Vendo&s;me,</HI> not yet fi|ni&s;h'd.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="12">The Gardens within the Walls, open to the
publick, are va&s;tly great, and very beautiful; as the <HI>Tuilleries, Palais
Royal, Luxembourg,</HI> the <HI>Royal Phy&s;ick Garden,</HI> of the
<HI>Ar&s;enal,</HI> and many belonging to Con|vents, the <HI>Carthu&s;ians,
Cele&s;tins, St. Victor, St. Genevieve, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But that which makes the dwelling in this City very diverting for
People of Quality, is the facility of going out with their Coaches into the
Fields, on every &s;ide; it lying round, and the Avenues to it &s;o well paved;
and the Places of Airing &s;o clean, open, or &s;hady, as you plea&s;e, or the
Sea&s;on of the year, and time of the day requires: As the <HI>Cour de la
Reyne, Bois de Bologne, Bois de Vin|cennes, les Sables de Vaugerarde,
&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But to de&s;cend to a more particular Review of this great City, I
think it not ami&s;s to &s;peak fir&s;t of the Streets and publick Places, and
what may be &s;een in them: Next of the Hou&s;es of Note; and what
Curio&s;ities of Nature or Art, al&s;o of Men and Libraries, I met with: Next,
of their Diet and Recreations: Next of the Gardens, and their Furniture and
Ornaments: Of the Air and Health. We &s;hall conclude the whole with the
pre&s;ent State of Phy&s;ic and Pharmacy here.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="section">
<PB N="12" REF="13">
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Coaches.</NOTE>To begin with the Coaches, which
are very numerous here and very fine in Gilding: But there are but few, and
tho&s;e only of the great Nobility, which are large, and have two Seats or
Funds. But what they want in the largene&s;s, beauty, and neatne&s;s of ours in
<HI>London,</HI> they have infinitely in the ea&s;ine&s;s of Carriage, and the
ready turning in the narrowe&s;t Streets. For this purpo&s;e, they are all
Crane-Neckt, and the Wheels be|fore very low, not above two foot and a half
Diameter; which makes them ea|&s;ie to get into, and brings down the Coach-Box
low, that you have a much better pro&s;pect out of the foremo&s;t Gla&s;s; our
high &s;eated Coachmen being ever in the point of view. Again, They are mo&s;t,
even Fiacres or Hackneys, hung with <HI>Double Springs,</HI> at the four
Corners, which in&s;en&s;ibly breaks all Jolts. This I never was &s;o
&s;en&s;ible off, as after having pra|cti&s;ed the <HI>Paris</HI> Coaches for
four months, I once rid in the ea&s;ie&s;t Chariot of my Lords, which came from
<HI>England;</HI> but not a Jolt but what affected a Man; &s;o as to be tired
more in one hour in that, than in &s;ix in the&s;e.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the great number of Coaches of the Gentry, here are
Coaches <HI>de Re|mi&s;e,</HI> <PB N="13" REF="13">by the month; which are very
well Guilt, neat Harne&s;s, and good Hor&s;es: And the&s;e all Strangers Hire
by the Day or Month, at about Three Crowns Eng|li&s;h a Day. 'Tis this &s;ort
that &s;poils the Hackneys and Chairs, which here are the mo&s;t na&s;ty and
mi&s;erable Voiture that can be; and yet near as dear again as in
<HI>London,</HI> and but very few of them neither.</P>
<P>Yet there is one more in this City, which I was willing to omit, as
thinking it at fir&s;t fight Scandalous, and a very Je&s;t; it being a wretched
Bu&s;ine&s;s in &s;o Magnificent a City; and that is, the <HI>Vinegrette,</HI>
a Coach on Two Wheels, dragg'd by a Man, and pu&s;h'd behind by a Woman or Boy,
or both.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides tho&s;e, for quick Travelling there are great number of
<HI>Po&s;t-Chai&s;es</HI> for a &s;ingle Per&s;on; and <HI>Roullions</HI> for
two Per&s;ons: The&s;e are on two Wheels only, and have each their Double
Springs to make them very ea&s;ie; they run very &s;wiftly: both the Hor&s;es
pull; but one only is in the Thilles. The Coach-man mounts the
<HI>Roullion;</HI> but for the <HI>Chai&s;e,</HI> he only mounts the &s;ide
Hor&s;e only. I think neither of the&s;e are in u&s;e in <HI>Eng|land;</HI> but
might be introduced to good purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="14"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Recreati|ons and
Walks.</NOTE>As for their <HI>Recreations and Walks,</HI> there are no People
more fond of coming to|gether, to &s;ee and to be &s;een. This Conver&s;ation
without doubt takes up a great part of their time: And for this purpo&s;e, the
<HI>Cour de la Reyne</HI> is frequen|ted by all People of Quality. It is a
Treble Walk of Trees of a great length, near the River &s;ide, the middle Walk
ha|ving above double the breadth to the two &s;ide ones; and will hold eight
files of Coaches, and in the middle a great open Circle to turn, with fine

here|after.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bi&s;hops.</NOTE>No &s;ort of People make a

&s;o nece&s;&s;ary a Quali|fication for tho&s;e Dignities, as with us; tho'
there are &s;ome of them very De|&s;erving and Learned Men. I &s;ay, They are
mo&s;t Noblemen, or the younger Sons of the be&s;t Families. This indeed, is
for the Honour of the Church; but whether it be for the good of Learning and
Piety is doubtful. They may be Patrons, but there are but few Examples of
Erudition among them. 'Tis to be wi&s;ht, that they exceeded others in Merit,
as they do in Birth.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Abbots.</NOTE>The <HI>Abbots</HI> here are
numerous, from all Parts of the Kingdom. They make a con&s;iderable figure, as
being a gentile &s;ort of Clergy, and the mo&s;t Learned; at lea&s;t were &s;o
from the time of Cardi|nal <HI>Richlieu,</HI> who preferred Men of the
greate&s;t Learning and Parts to the&s;e Po&s;ts; and that very frankly, and
with|out their knowing it before-hand, much le&s;s &s;olliciting him for it. He
took a &s;ure way, peculiar to him&s;elf, to enquire out privately Men of
De&s;ert, and took his own time to prefer them. This filled the Kingdom of
<HI>France</HI> with learned Men, and gave great Encouragement to Study;
whereof <HI>France</HI> yet has &s;ome feeling.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="15"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Signs in the
Streets.</NOTE>'Tis pretty to ob&s;erve, how the King Di&s;ciplines this great
City, by &s;mall in|&s;tances of Obedience. He cau&s;ed them to take down all
their Signs at once, and not to advance them above a foot or two from the Wall,
nor to exceed &s;uch a &s;mall mea&s;ure of &s;quare; which was readily done:
So that the Signs ob&s;cure not the Streets at all, and make little or no
figure, as tho' there were none; being placed very high and little.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ho&s;tels.</NOTE>There are great number of
<HI>Ho&s;tels</HI> in <HI>Paris,</HI> by which word is meant <HI>Publick
Inns,</HI> where Lodgings are Lett; and al&s;o the Noblemen and Gentlemens
Hou&s;es are &s;o called, mo&s;tly with Titles over the Gate in Letters of Gold
on a Black Mar|ble. This &s;eems, as it were to denote, that they came at
fir&s;t to <HI>Paris</HI> as Stran|gers only, and Inn'd publickly; but at
length built them Inns or Hou&s;es of their own. 'Tis certain, a great and
wealthy City cannot be without People of Qua|lity; nor &s;uch a Court as that
of <HI>France</HI> without the daily In&s;pection of what &s;uch People do. But
whether the Country can &s;pare them or not, I que&s;tion. The People of
<HI>England</HI> &s;eem to have le&s;s Man|ners and le&s;s Religion, where the
Gentry <PB N="17" REF="15">have left them wholly to them&s;elves; and the Taxes
are rai&s;ed with more dif|ficulty, inequality, and inju&s;tice, than when the
Landlords live upon the De&s;|maines.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The City rebuilt.</NOTE>It may very well he, that
<HI>Paris</HI> is in a manner a new City within this 40 years. 'Tis certain
&s;ince this King came to the Crown, 'tis &s;o much altered for the better,
that 'tis quite another thing; and if it be true what the Workmen told me, that
a common Hou&s;e built of Rough Stone and Plai&s;tered over, would not la&s;t
above 25 years, the greate&s;t part of the City has been lately rebuilt. In
this Age certainly mo&s;t of the great Ho|&s;tels are built or re-edified; in
like man|ner the Convents, the Bridges and Churches, the Gates of the City; add
the great alteration of the Streets, the Keyes upon the River, the Pavements;
all the&s;e have had great additions, or are quite new.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Boats upon the River.</NOTE>In the River
among&s;t the Bridges, both above and below, are a va&s;t number of Boats, of
Wood, Hay, Charcoal, Corn and Wine, and other Commodities. But when a &s;udden
Thaw comes, they are often in danger of being &s;plit and cru&s;ht to pieces 
<PB N="18" REF="16">upon the Bridges; which al&s;o are &s;ome|times ruined by
them. There have been great Lo&s;&s;es to the Owners of &s;uch Boats and
Goods.</P>
<P>It has been propo&s;ed to dig near the City a large <HI>Ba&s;in</HI>
for a Winter Har|bour; but this has not had the face of Profit to the
Government; &s;o they are &s;till left to execute their own Project. There are
no Laws or Projects &s;o effectu|al here, as what bring Profit to the
Go|vernment. Farming is admirably well under&s;tood here.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lawyers.</NOTE>Among&s;t the Living Objects to be
&s;een in the Streets of <HI>Paris,</HI> the Coun&s;ellors and Chief Officers
of the Courts of Ju|&s;tice make a great Figure; They and their Wives have
their Trains carried up; &s;o there are abundance to be &s;een walking about
the Streets in this manner. 'Tis for this that places of that nature &s;ell
&s;o well. A Man that has a right to qualifie a Wife with this Honour, &s;hall
command a Fortune; and the carrying a great Vel|vet Cu&s;hion to Church is
&s;uch another bu&s;ine&s;s. The Place of a Lawyer is va|lued a Third part
dearer for this.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Monks.</NOTE>Here are al&s;o daily to be &s;een
in the Streets great variety of <HI>Monks,</HI> in &s;trange 
<PB N="19" REF="16">unu&s;ual Habits to us <HI>Engli&s;hmen:</HI> The&s;e make
an odd Figure, and furni&s;h well a Picture. I cannot but pity the mi&s;taken
Zeal of the&s;e poor Men; that put them|&s;elves into Religion, as they call
it, and renounce the World, and give them|&s;elves mo&s;t &s;evere Rules of
Living and Diet; &s;ome of the Orders are decently enough Cloathed, as the
Je&s;uits, the Fa|thers of the Oratory, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but mo&s;t are very
particular and ob&s;olete in their Dre&s;s, as being the Ru&s;tic Habit of old
times, without Linnen, or Ornaments of the pre&s;ent Age.</P>
<P>As to their Meager Diet, it is much again&s;t Nature, and the
improved Diet of Mankind. The <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> Law provided much better for
<HI>Jews,</HI> a cho&s;en People; That was in&s;tituted for cleanline&s;s and
health. Now for the Chri&s;tian Law, though it commands Humility and Pa|tience
under Sufferings, and Mortificati|on and Ab&s;tinence from Sinful Lu&s;ts and
Plea&s;ures; yet by no means a di&s;tinct Food, but liberty to eat any thing
what|&s;oever, much le&s;s na&s;tine&s;s; and the Pa|pi&s;ts them&s;elves in
other things are of this mind; for their Churches are clean, pompou&s;ly
adorned and perfumed. 'Tis enough, if we chance to &s;uffer Per&s;ecu|tion, to
endure it with Patience, and all <PB N="20" REF="17">the mi&s;erable
Circum&s;tances that attend it; but wantonly to per&s;ecute our &s;elves, is to
do violence to Chri&s;tianity, and to put our &s;elves in a wor&s;e &s;tate
than the <HI>Jews</HI> were; for to choo&s;e the wor&s;t of Food, which is
&s;owre Herbs and Fi&s;h, and &s;uch like Tra&s;h, and to lie wor&s;e al|ways
rough, in cour&s;e and na&s;ty Wool|len Frocks upon Boards; To go Bare|foot in
a cold Country, to deny them|&s;elves the Comforts of this Life, and the
Conver&s;ation of Men; This, I &s;ay, is to hazard our Healths, to renounce the
greate&s;t Ble&s;&s;ings of this Life, and in a manner to de&s;troy our
&s;elves. The&s;e Men, I &s;ay, cannot but be in the main Chagrin, and
therefore as they are out of humour with the World, &s;o they mu&s;t in time be
weary of &s;uch &s;la|vi&s;h and fruitle&s;s Devotion, which is not attended
with an active Life.</P>
<P>The great multitude of <HI>poor</HI> Wretches in all parts of this
City is &s;uch, that a Man in a Coach, a-foot, in the Shop, is not able to do
any bu&s;ine&s;s for the num|bers and importunities of Beggars; and to hear
their Mi&s;eries is very lamentable; and if you give to one, you immediately
bring a whole &s;warm upon you. The&s;e, I &s;ay, are true Monks, if you will,
of God Almighties making, offering you <PB N="21" REF="17">their Prayers for a
Farthing, that find the evil of the day &s;ufficient for the day, and that the
Mi&s;eries of this Life are not to be courted, or made a mock of; The&s;e
Wor&s;hip much again&s;t their will all rich Men, and make Saints of the re&s;t
of Mankind for a Mor&s;el of Bread.</P>
<P>But let the&s;e Men alone with their mi&s;taken Zeal; it is
certainly God's good Providence which orders all things in this World. And the
Fle&s;h Eaters will ever defend them&s;elves, if not beat the Lenten Men; good
and whol&s;ome Food, and plenty of it, gives Men naturally great Courage.
Again, a Nation will &s;ooner be Peopled by the free Marriage of all &s;orts of
People, than by the additio|nal &s;tealth of a few &s;tarved Monks,
&s;up|po&s;ing them at any time to break their Vow. This limiting of Marriage
to a certain People only is a deduction and an abatement of Mankind, not le&s;s
in a Pa|pi&s;t Country, than a con&s;tant War. A|gain, this le&s;&s;ens al&s;o
the number of God's Wor&s;hippers, in&s;tead of multiply|ing them as the Stars
in the Firmament, or the Sand upon the Sea Shoar; The&s;e Men wilfully cut off
their Po&s;terity, and reduce Gods Congregation for the fu|ture.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="18"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Publick Cries.</NOTE>There is
very little noi&s;e in this City of <HI>Publick Cries</HI> of things to be
&s;old, or any Di&s;turbance from Pamphlets and Hawkers. One thing I wondered
at, that I heard of nothing lo&s;t, nor any publick Adverti&s;ements, till I
was &s;hewed Printed Papers upon the Corners of Streets, wherein were in great
Letters, <HI>&V;n, Deux, Cinq, Dix ju&s;&abque; a Cinquante Loui&s;&s;e a
gagner,</HI> that is, from One to Fifty Loui&s;es to be got; and then
underneath an account of what was lo&s;t. This &s;ure is a good and quiet way;
for by this means without noi&s;e you often find your Goods again; every body
that has found them repair|ing in a day or two to &s;uch places. The
<HI>Gazettes</HI> come out but once a week, and but few People buy them.</P>
<P>'Tis difficult and dangerous to vend a Libel here. While we were in
Town, a certain Per&s;on gave a Bundle of them to a blind Man, a Beggar of the
Ho&s;pital of the <HI>Quincevint,</HI> telling him he might get five pence for
every penny; he went to <HI>No&s;tredame,</HI> and cried them up in the Service
time, <HI>La vie &amp; Miracles de Eve&s;&abque; de Reims.</HI> This was a
Trick that was play'd the Archbi&s;hop, as it was thought, by the Je&s;uits,
with whom he has had a great Conte&s;t about <HI>Molinas</HI> the <HI>Spani&s;h

pre&s;ent Archbi&s;hop, Duke and fir&s;t Peer of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Streets Lighted.</NOTE>The Streets are lighted
alike all the Winter long, as well when the Moon &s;hines, as at other times of
the Month; which I remember the rather, becau&s;e of the impertinent u&s;age of
our People at <HI>London,</HI> to take away the Lights for half of the Month,
as though the Moon was certain to &s;hine and light the Streets, and that there
could be no Cloudy Weather in Winter. The Lanthorns here hang down in the very
middle of all the Streets, about 20 paces di&s;tance, and 20 foot high. They
are made of a &s;quare of Gla&s;s about 2 foot deep, covered with a broad Plate
of Iron; and the Rope that lets them down, is &s;ecured and lockt up in an Iron
Funnel and little Trunk fa&s;t|ned into the Wall of the Hou&s;e. The&s;e
Lanthorns have Candles of 4 in the pound in them, which la&s;t burning till
after mid|night.</P>
<P>As to the&s;e Lights, if any Man break them, he is forthwith &s;ent
to the Gallies; and there were 3 young Gentlemen of good Families, who were in
Pri&s;on for having done it in a Frolick, and could <PB N="24" REF="19">not be
relea&s;ed thence in &s;ome Months; and that not without the diligent
Appli|cation of good Friends at Court.</P>
<P>The Lights at <HI>Paris</HI> for 5 Months in the year only, co&s;t
near 50000<HI><ABBR>l.</ABBR> Sterling.</HI> This way of Lighting the Streets
is in u&s;e al&s;o in &s;ome other Cities in <HI>France.</HI> The King is
&s;aid to have rai&s;ed a large Tax by it. In the Preface to the Tax it is
&s;aid, That con&s;idering the great danger his Sub|jects were in, in Walking
the Streets in the Dark, from Thieves, and the breaking their Necks by falls,
he for &s;uch a Sum of Money did grant this Priviledge, that they might hang
out Lanthorns in this manner.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Streets clean.</NOTE>I have &s;aid, that the
Avenues to the City, and all the Streets, are paved with a very hard <HI>Sand
Stone,</HI> about 8 Inches &s;quare; &s;o they have a great care to keep them
clean; in Winter, for Example, upon the melting of the Ice, by a heavy drag
with a Hor&s;e, which makes a quick riddance and cleaning the Gutters; &s;o
that in a days time all parts of the Town are to admiration clean and neat
again to walk on.</P>
<P>I could heartily wi&s;h their <HI>Summer</HI> cleanline&s;s was as
great; it is certainly as nece&s;&s;ary to keep &s;o populous a City 
<PB N="25" REF="19">&s;weet; but I know no Machine &s;ufficient, but what would
empty it of the People too; all the Threats and In&s;criptions up|on Walls are
to little purpo&s;e. The Du&s;t in <HI>London</HI> in Summer is oftentimes, if
a Wind blow, very trouble&s;ome, if not intolerable; in <HI>Paris</HI> there is
much le&s;s of it, and the rea&s;on is, the flat Stones require little Sand to
&s;et them fa&s;t, where|as our &s;mall Pebles, not coming together, require a
va&s;t quantity to lay them fa&s;t in Paving.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Statues Eque&s;tres.</HI></NOTE>But from the
People in the Streets, to the dead Ornaments there: There are an infinite
number of Bu&s;to's of the Grand Monarque every where put up by the Common
People; but the Noble <HI>Statues</HI> are but few, con&s;idering the
Ob&s;equious Humour and Capacity of the People to perform.</P>
<P>That in the <HI>Place-Victoire</HI> is a-foot in Bra&s;s all over
gilt; with <HI>Victoire;</HI> that is, a va&s;t Winged Woman clo&s;e behind his
Back, holding forth a Laurel Crown over the Kings Head, with one Foot up|on a
Globe. There are great exceptions taken at the Gilding by Arti&s;ts; and,
indeed the &s;hining &s;eems to &s;poil the Fea|tures, and give I know not what
confu|&s;ion; it had better have been all of Gold <PB N="26" REF="20">bra&s;&s;ed over; which would have given its true Lights and Shaddows,
and &s;uf|fered the Eye to judge of the proportions. But that which I like not
in this, is the great Woman perpetually at the Kings Back; which is a &s;ort of
Embarras, and in&s;tead of giving Victory, &s;eems to tire him with her
Company. The <HI>Roman Victorie</HI> was a little Puppit in the Empe|rours
Hand, which he could di&s;po&s;e of at plea&s;ure; This Woman is enough to give

<P>The other of <HI>Lewis</HI> the Thirteenth in the
<HI>Place-Royal,</HI> Armed al&s;o after the Mode of the Age, and his Plume of
Fea|thers on his Headpiece.</P>
<P>The 3d is of this pre&s;ent King <HI>Louis</HI> the Fourteenth, and
de&s;igned for the <HI>Place Vendo&s;me.</HI> This Colo&s;&s;us of Bra&s;s is
yet in the very place where it was ca&s;t; it is &s;urpri&s;ingly great, being
22 foot high, the Foot of the King 26 inches in length, and all the proportions
of him and the Hor&s;e &s;uitable. There was 100000 pound weight of Mettal
melted, <PB N="27" REF="20">but it took not up above 80000 pounds; it was all
ca&s;t at once, Hor&s;e and Man. Mon&s;. <HI>Girardon</HI> told me, he wrought
di|ligently, and with almo&s;t daily applica|tion at the Model 8 years, and
there were two years more &s;pent in the Mould|ing, and Furnaces, and Ca&s;ting
of it. The King is in the Habit of a <HI>Roman</HI> Em|peror, without Stirrups
or Saddle, and on his Head a French large Periwig <HI>A-la|mode.</HI> Whence
this great Liberty of Sculpture ari&s;es, I am much to &s;eek.</P>
<P>'Tis true, that in building preci&s;ely to follow the ancient manner
and &s;implici|ty is very commendable, becau&s;e all tho&s;e Orders were
founded upon good Prin|ciples in Mathematicks; but the Cloath|ing of an
Emperor, was no more, than the weak fancy of the People. For <HI>Louis le
Grand</HI> to be thus dre&s;&s;ed up at the head of his Army now a-days would
be very Comical. What need other Em|blems, when Truth may be had; as though the
pre&s;ent Age need be a&s;hamed of their Modes, or that the <HI>Statua
E|que&s;tris</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth, or <HI>Louis</HI> the
Thirteenth, were the le&s;s to be valued for being done in the true Dre&s;s of
their times. It &s;eems to me to be the effect of Mi&s;taken Flattery, but if
regarded only as a Piece of meer Art, it is me-thinks <PB N="28" REF="21">very
unbecoming, and has no Graceful Air with it.</P>
<P>I remember I was at the <HI>Levee</HI> of King <HI>Charles</HI> the
Second, when 3 Models were brought him, to choo&s;e one of, in order to make
his Statue for the Court at <HI>Wind|&s;or;</HI> he cho&s;e the <HI>Roman</HI>
Emperours Dre&s;s, and cau&s;ed it al&s;o to be executed in that other erected
for him in the <HI>Old Exchange</HI> in <HI>London.</HI> The like is of K.
<HI>J.</HI> in <HI>White|hall,</HI> at <HI>Chel&s;ey-Colledge,</HI> our
<HI>Invalides.</HI> Now I appeal to all Mankind, whether in re|pre&s;enting a
living Prince now a-days the&s;e naked Arms and Legs are decent, and whether
there is not a <HI>barbarity</HI> very di&s;plea&s;ing in it. The Father of
the&s;e two Kings, <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t, was the Prince of this Age of
the be&s;t Reli&s;h, and of a &s;ound Judgment, particularly in Painting,
Sculpture, Architecture by Sea and Land, witne&s;s the va&s;t Sum of Money he
be|&s;towed upon <HI>Rubens</HI> and his Di&s;ciple <HI>Vandyke.</HI> Al&s;o
the great E&s;teem he had for the incomparable <HI>Inigo Jones,</HI> who was
the fir&s;t <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> in this Age that under&s;tood Building. I
heard <HI>Auzout</HI> &s;ay, when he had viewed the
<HI>Banquetting-Hou&s;e</HI> at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> that it was preferable to
all the Buildings on this &s;ide the <HI>Alpes;</HI> and I ought to believe
him, he having &s;tudied <HI>Vitruvius</HI> more than 40 years to|gether 
<PB N="29" REF="21">mo&s;tly upon the place and at <HI>Rome.</HI> Al&s;o the
Ship the <HI>Sovereign,</HI> which was truly the Noble&s;t floating Ca&s;tle
that ever &s;wam the Sea. Yet after all this, that King had a <HI>Statua
Eque&s;tris</HI> of him&s;elf erected, now at <HI>Charingcro&s;s,</HI> ca&s;t
in the full Habit of his own time, and which I think may com|pare with the

&s;aw the <HI>Palais Mazarin,</HI> in which are many good Pictures, but the Low

<HI>Roman</HI> Sta|tues, and is what I mo&s;t took notice of; They were mo&s;t

<HI>de Mazarin,</HI> who in a hot Fit of De|votion <PB N="30" REF="22">cau&s;ed
them to be ca&s;trated and mangled, and then frocked them by a &s;ad Hand with
I know not what Plai&s;ter of <HI>Paris,</HI> which makes them very
ridi|culous. <HI>Cicero</HI> &s;omewhere tells us, that &s;ome of the ancient
Wi&s;e Men thought there was nothing naturally ob&s;cene, but that every thing
might be called by its own Name; but our <HI>Cel&s;us</HI> is of another mind,
and begs Pardon, being a <HI>Roman,</HI> that he writ of tho&s;e Matters in his

furni&s;ht his Cabinet and Gallery with Naked Pictures, but with the
<HI>Togatae</HI> only; or if it had once plea&s;ed him to do otherwi&s;e, he
&s;hould not have Cloathed them; which was at be&s;t but a vain O&s;tentation
of his Cha&s;tity, and betrayed his ignorance and di&s;like of good things;
that is, &s;poils and hides the noble Art of the Sculpture, for which only they

<P>But why &s;hould Nudity be &s;o offen&s;ive, &s;ince a very great

<P>'Tis plain by the&s;e and many other E|legant Statues I &s;aw at

fa&s;hion of the <HI>Roman</HI> Habit, it is evident by the&s;e ancient
Statues, (which <HI>Oct. Ferrarius</HI> has well and rea&s;onably fol|lowed in
explicating the &s;everal Garments of the Ancients) that the <HI>Tunica</HI> or
Shirt was without a Collar or Sleeves, and girt high up under the Brea&s;ts;
al&s;o, that the <HI>Toga</HI> or <HI>Gown</HI> was a wide and long Garment
open at both ends, and let down over the Head, and &s;upported by the Left Hand
thru&s;t under the Skirts of it, whil&s;t the top of it re&s;ted upon the left
Shoulder; The Right Hand and Arm was naked, and above the Gown, &s;o that the
Gown was ungirt and always loo&s;e. Now for the purpo&s;e, when a
<HI>Roman</HI> made him&s;elf naked for the Bath, (as he daily did ju&s;t
before eating) he had no|thing to do but to draw up his Left Hand, and the Gown
fell down at his Feet; and at the &s;ame time to loo&s;e the Girdle of the
Tunica, and to draw up both his Arms from under the Tunica, and that al&s;o
fell at his Feet.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Ages of the Commonwealth they wore a Toga or Gown
only, after|wards they put on next the Skin a Tunica <PB N="32" REF="23">or
Shirt, and never added more in the very Splendour and Luxury of the Em|pire;
all other Matters of Cloathing, of what nature &s;oever, have been invented
&s;ince.</P>
<P>I much admired, that in the great numbers of ancient Statues to be
&s;een in and about <HI>Paris,</HI> I could never meet any one but what was
Cloathed with a <HI>Toga pura,</HI> and no repre&s;entation of a Bullated
one.</P>
<P>This <HI>Toga</HI> and <HI>Tunica</HI> both were made of fine white
Wooll, or Flannel: They had not a Rag of Linnen about them. This Flannel, I
&s;ay, was very fine, for the folds are &s;mall, and it falls into them
ea&s;ily; and &s;eems to be very light, by the handling of it, to rai&s;e it by
the Finger and Thumb only, as is the Air of &s;ome of the Statues, and the
whole Garment to be &s;u&s;pended by the left Shoulder: Upon the lea&s;t
&s;training of it, the Brea&s;ts and Nipples are vi&s;ible through it; al&s;o
the proportions of the Thighs.</P>
<P>This wearing all Woollen in a hot Country, brought on the u&s;e and
nece&s;&s;ity of frequent Bathing, otherwi&s;e they could never have kept
them&s;elves &s;weet and clean; and the nece&s;&s;ity of Bathing kept them to
this &s;ort of loo&s;e Garment; and much Bathing brought in Oils, and Oils
Per|fumes infu&s;ed in them.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="23">But in my mind a fair Linnen Shirt every day is
as great a pre&s;ervative to Neat|ne&s;s and Cleane&s;s of the Skin and Health,
as daily Bathing was to the <HI>Romans.</HI> 'Tis certain, had they not u&s;ed
either &s;imple Oils of Olives, &s;ometimes unripe and old, for the
a&s;tringency, and &s;ometimes ripe and perfumed, the warm Water mu&s;t have
much decayed Nature, and made the Skin intolerable tender and wrinkled. The
Naked <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>Blacks</HI> &s;ecure their Skins by Oils at this
day from all the in|juries of the Weather, both from Heat and Cold.</P>
<P>But the be&s;t Rule of Health and long Life is to do little to our
&s;elves: People are not aware what inconveniencies they bring upon
them&s;elves by cu&s;tom, how they will plead for things long u&s;ed, and make
that plea&s;ant which is very de&s;tru|ctive to their Healths; as in the Ca&s;e
of Cloathing, Tobacco, Strong Waters, Steel Remedies, the Drinking Mineral
Waters, Bathing, Tea, Coffee, Chocolate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>One little Statue I took more particular notice of, for the elegance
of the Sculp|ture, and the humour of the Dre&s;s; it &s;tood upon a Table; it
was the Figure of a Sybil: The Face of the old Woman was cut very deep into the
Stone, within the Quoifure, like a Hood pulled over the <PB N="34" REF="24">Forehead, a very Emblem of an Oracle, which is hid, dark, and
ambiguous, as the Woman her &s;elf, who would have nei|ther her Face &s;een,
nor her Saying ea&s;ily under&s;tood; that is, &s;he is as it were a&s;hamed of
her Cheat.</P>
<P>What was the fancy of the Men of the fir&s;t Ages to make <HI>Old
Women Prophete&s;&s;es,</HI> to utter Oracles, and to interpret the Will of the
Gods by the eating of Ani|mals. To make them <HI>Sagae</HI> and
<HI>Veneficae</HI> is rea&s;onable enough; for old Age makes all People
&s;piteful, but more the weaker Sex; To Poi&s;on and Bewitch are the &s;e|cret
Revenges of Impotent People.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jews</HI> were impatient of the Com|pany of Women in their
Religious Rites, le&s;t they &s;hould contaminate and &s;poil all their
Devotion. The <HI>Romans</HI> on the con|trary thought Religion became Women
better than Men, for be&s;ides the general parts they had in common with the
Men in Adoration of their Gods, they had al&s;o peculiar ones, where the Men
were not concerned. <HI>Tully</HI> bids his Wife &s;uppli|cate the Gods for
him; for he tells her, he thought they would be kinder to her than him. Upon
&s;ome &s;uch Principle, probably, their Prophete&s;&s;es were in e&s;teem.</P>

<P>I was &s;everal times with him, and once he carried me into an upper

modern; a|mong&s;t them there were 4 large Drawers, 3 of which were the Medals

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Luxem|burgh</HI> P.</NOTE>The <HI>Palace of
Luxemburgh</HI> is the mo&s;t fini&s;ht of all the Royal Buildings; it is very
magnificent, well de&s;igned, were it not for the triflng Inter&s;ections or
round and deep Jointings of the Columns, which looks like a Chee&s;emongers
Shop, and which is below the grandeur of the Or|ders, &s;o hard a matter it is
to have a true Re|li&s;h of the ancient Simplicity, and not to add impertinent
Ornaments. And to &s;ay the truth, there are not many things in <HI>Paris</HI>
where this Cha&s;tity is &s;trictly pre|&s;erved; among&s;t tho&s;e, where
little is to be blamed, are the South Ea&s;t Front of the <HI>Louvre,</HI> the
Facade of <HI>St. Gervais,</HI> and the whole Building of <HI>Val de
Grace.</HI> And this Wantonne&s;s in additional Or|naments may perhaps be one
rea&s;on, why the <HI>Doric</HI> is more practi&s;ed here at this 
<PB N="39" REF="26">day, the Modillions naturally admitting greater variety,
and according to the in|tended u&s;e of the Building.</P>
<P>In this Palace is that famous Gallery, where the Hi&s;tory of
<HI>Maria</HI> of <HI>Medicis</HI> is Painted by <HI>Rubens.</HI> Though this
was done 70 years ago, it is as fre&s;h as at the fir&s;t; &s;o great a
Ma&s;ter he was in Colour|ing. His Fle&s;h is admirable, and his Scarlet, for
which, if he had not a &s;e|cret, not now under&s;tood, he had le&s;s Avarice,
and more Honour, than mo&s;t of our Modern Painters. 'Tis certain the
goodne&s;s of Colours was one of the great Cares and Studies of the late
fa|mous Painters; and that which &s;eems mo&s;t to have obliged them to it, was
the nece&s;&s;ity they put them&s;elves upon, to Paint all their own De&s;igns,
and more particularly the pre&s;ent Dre&s;&s;es. And though <HI>Rubens</HI> in
his Hi&s;tory is too much a Libertine in this re&s;pect, yet there is in this
very place, which we now de&s;cribe, much truth in the habit of his principal
Figures, as of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth, the Queen, her Son, the 3
Daughters and the Cardinal; though indeed the Allegoric a&s;&s;i&s;tants in all
the Tableaux are very airy and fancifully &s;et out. His Scholar <HI>St. Aut.
Vandyke</HI> did introduce this No|velty too much in <HI>England,</HI> where
the <PB N="40" REF="27">Per&s;ons would bear it; as the Female Sex were very
willing to do, who &s;eem in his time to have been mighty fond of being Painted
in <HI>di&s;habille.</HI> 'Twas this that cut out of bu&s;ine&s;s the be&s;t
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Painter of his time, <HI>Cornelius John&s;on,</HI> and
&s;hortned his Life by Grief. It is certain with a little patience all Dre&s;s
becomes <HI>di&s;habille;</HI> but I appeal, whether it is not better and much
more plea&s;ing to &s;ee the old Fa&s;hion of a dead Friend, or Relation, or of
a Man of Di&s;tinction, Painted as he was, than a foppi&s;h Night-Gown, and odd
Quoifure, which never belonged to the Per&s;on Painted.</P>
<P>But that which led me into this Re|flection was, that the Modern
Painters have hereby an opportunity to be idle, and to have others to work
under them; it is &s;ufficient to fini&s;h the Face, and to &s;end it out to be
Dre&s;t at the Block; where|as were they obliged in Honour to Paint the whole
Dre&s;&s;es, this would make them accurate in Colouring, through the great
variety which would daily occur, and and that noble Art be in a far greater
e&s;teem.</P>
<P>A good Arti&s;t might ea&s;ily reduce it, and command the Pur&s;es
of tho&s;e he Paints, to pay well for his labour and time, for it is the lot
but of very few Men to excel in this Noble Art.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="27">In the Antichamber of the Queens Apartment there
are other Paintings of <HI>Rubens,</HI> as, in 3 di&s;tinct Tableaux, at the
upper end of the Room the Ceremonies of the Marriages of her 3 Daughters, to
<HI>Savoy, Spain,</HI> and <HI>England.</HI> Al&s;o in an other Hi&s;torical
Tableaux, on the &s;ide of the &s;ame Room, he has Painted his own Picture, in
a very free and ea&s;ie po&s;ture, next the Eye, up in the very corner,
look|ing out, as unconcerned in his own Ta|bleaux, upon the 3 Ladies. He has
done his Wife in &s;ome of the Tableaux in the great Gallery; but in the
la&s;t, where the Queen is mounting up to Heaven, &s;he is drawn up after her;
but whether it be her full and heavy Body, or her Mind, &s;he is Painted in a
very unwilling po|&s;ture, bending back: It &s;eems her Hu&s;|band liked her
Company too well to part with her ea&s;ily, or &s;he with him.</P>
<P>Several of the Rooms of this Apart|ment were Wain&s;coted with
Cedar, wrought in Flowers, as her Dre&s;&s;ing Room and Oratory; which is rare
in <HI>Paris.</HI> The Floors were made of &s;mall Wood put together in

marvellous effect; but the firmne&s;s, duration, and intire|ne&s;s of the&s;e

Antient and mo&s;t Curious of all; con|cerning which he is ready to publi&s;h a

<P><PB N="48" REF="31">The Antiquity of this Marble, be&s;ides the
known Hi&s;tory and Names which ju|&s;tifie the time of tho&s;e Men: The Figure

here; no &eegr;, no &ohgr;, but all graved with e, o; al&s;o the Letters, L, P,

borrowed their Letters from the Antient Greek Alpha|bet.</P>
<P>The Invention and Borrowing of Let|ters was a great Happine&s;s to
Mankind. The Embarras in which Writing is in <HI>China,</HI> is owing to the
Misfortune of wanting an Alphabet; &s;o that the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> are forc'd
to expre&s;s every Sentence and Thought by a different Character, which has
multiplied their Writing to 120000 Characters; of which yet they have le&s;s
need than we in <HI>Europe,</HI> who perform all with 24 Letters, (whereof 5
add life to the other 19, &s;aith <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> which is an Argument of
the Age he writ in, the Knowledge of Grammar, <HI>i. e.</HI> Read|ing and
Writing, depends upon &s;even Figures, <HI>de Dieta.</HI> 1.) the
<HI>Chine&s;es</HI> know much le&s;s than we; they have no other Morals, they
have le&s;s Philo&s;ophy, le&s;s Ma|thematicks, fewer Arts, and yet much
nar|rower Knowledge of Natural Hi&s;tory, be|cau&s;e <PB N="49" REF="31">they
can know but of that, which they have at home: In what therefore &s;hould they
employ this multitude of Characters! 'Tis, I &s;ay, their Misfortune not to
have Thought of an Alphabet: Their common Language is as ea&s;ily learnt, and
con&s;equently might as ea&s;ily be writ, as any in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>But to return to Mon&s;ieur <HI>Budelot</HI>'s Stores. In this

Among&s;t the re&s;t of the Marbles there is a Ba&s;&s;e-Relief, very extant,
and finely fi|ni&s;ht, of a Cupid a&s;leep, leaning his Head upon his Left Arm;
In his Hand he holds two <HI>Poppy Heads.</HI> 'Tis probable the Poppies were
Emblimatique from the Power they have in Love-Affairs. In|deed, mo&s;t
Poi&s;ons affect tho&s;e Parts chiefly, being the great Sluce of the Ha|bit of

<P>I enjoyed this Gentleman's Company very often; and had much
Di&s;cour&s;e with him about his Books of the <HI>&V;tility of Voyages;</HI>

<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>Boudelot</HI> reads it thus, <HI>Jovi Victori

<P>I was indi&s;po&s;ed, and &s;o could not ac|cept of the Favour which
was offered me of &s;eeing the Moon in their Tele&s;copes; and to go down into
the Vault, which was contrived for &s;eeing the Stars at Noon|tide, but without

a Rock formed in the Cave by the dropping of a Spring of Petrifying Wa|ter; of

indeed, u&s;ed the great|e&s;t Blocks of Stone that could be got, and have laid
them without Mortar, and the lea&s;t &s;ide outward, after the manner of the

is taken up out of the Stone Pits, in and about <HI>Paris,</HI> which makes the
4th &s;ort of Stone: If it be wrought up into Walls, as it is taken out of the
Pits, it is very apt to be flawed by the Fro&s;t; but if it be laid in the Air,
and kept under cover for two years, then it becomes dry and more durable.</P>
<P>I &s;aw but one Piece in <HI>Paris</HI> of the Ruines of an <HI>Old

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Verney.</HI></NOTE>I was to &s;ee Mon&s;ieur
<HI>Verney</HI> at his A|partment at the upper-end of the Royal Phy&s;ick
Garden; but mi&s;&s;ing my Vi&s;it, went up, with a young Gentleman of my Lord
Amba&s;&s;ador's Retinue, to &s;ee Mr. <HI>Bennis,</HI> who was in the
Di&s;&s;ecting Room, working by him&s;elf upon a Dead Body, with his Brea&s;t
and Belly gutted: There were very odd things to be &s;een in the Room. My
Companion, it being morning, and his Sen&s;es very quick and vigorous, was
&s;trangely &s;urpri&s;ed and offended; and retired down the Stairs much
fa&s;ter than he came up: And in|deed, a private Anatomy Room is to one not
accu&s;tomed to this kind of Manufa|cture, very irk&s;ome, if not frightful:
Here a Basket of Di&s;&s;ecting In&s;truments, as Knives, Saws,

put Men upon this Study, it could not be en|dured: for In&s;tinct and Nature
mo&s;t cer|tainly abhors the Employment.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mon&s;ieur <HI>Merrie.</HI></NOTE>I &s;aw
Mon&s;ieur <HI>Merrie,</HI> a mo&s;t painful and accurate Anatomi&s;t, and free
and communicative Per&s;on, at his Hou&s;e <HI>Rue de la Prince&s;&s;e.</HI>
His Cabinet con&s;i&s;ted of two Chambers: In the outward were great variety of
Skeletons; al&s;o entire Preparations of the Nerves; in two of which he
&s;hewed me the mi&s;take of <HI>Willis,</HI> and from thence gathered, that he
was not much u&s;ed to Di&s;&s;ect with his own Hand: The <HI>Pia Mater</HI>
coating the Spinal Nerves but half way down the Back, where it ends: The
<HI>Dura Mater</HI> coating the lowermo&s;t 20 pair; which, <HI>Willis,</HI>
(as he &s;aid) has otherwi&s;e reported.</P>
<P>But that which much delighted my Curio&s;ity, was the
Demon&s;tration of a blown and dried Heart of a <HI>Foetus;</HI> al&s;o the
Heart of a <HI>Tortoi&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="39">In the Heart of a <HI>Foetus,</HI> he &s;hewed
it quite open, and he would have it that there was no Valve to the <HI>Foramen
Ovale;</HI> which &s;eem'd equally open from the Left Ventricle to the Right,
as the contrary; that it's Diameter well near equalled that of the
<HI>Aorta:</HI> That the two Arteries, which a&s;cend up into the two Lobes of
the Lungs, (and are the Ramifications of the Pulmonick Artery, after it has
parted with the <HI>Canal of Communication,</HI> which goes betwixt the
Pulmonick Artery and the lower or de&s;cending Branch of the <HI>Aorta</HI>)
both put together, far exceed, if not double the Diameter of the <HI>Aorta</HI>
it &s;elf.</P>
<P>He therefore, not without good Rea&s;on a&s;&s;irms, That of all the
Blood which the <HI>Vena Cava</HI> pours into the Right Ventricle of the Heart,
and is thence in a <HI>Foetus</HI> forced up into the Pulmonick Artery, a great
part is carried by the Canal of Com|munication into the de&s;cending Trunk of
the <HI>Aorta,</HI> and is &s;o circulated about the Body, the Lungs (as to
that part) be|ing wholly &s;lighted: Al&s;o that of the two remaining thirds of
the Blood, which is carried about the Lungs, when it comes down the Pulmonick
Vein, that which cannot be received by the <HI>Aorta,</HI> (and all cannot,
becau&s;e the <HI>Aorta</HI> is much le&s;s <PB N="66" REF="40">than the two
Branches of the Pulmonick Artery put together) is therefore <HI>di&s;charged
back</HI> through the <HI>Foramen Ovale,</HI> into the Right Ventricle of the
Heart, and &s;o thrown up again with the re&s;t of the Blood, coming from the
<HI>Vena Cava.</HI> So that one part of the two remaining parts of the Blood is
daily carried about the Body, as in an Adult Foetus, and a third part only
Circulates in the Lungs, pa&s;|&s;ing by the Body or Grand Circulati|on.</P>
<P>That all this is done to abbreviate and reduce the Circulation to a
le&s;&s;er compa&s;s, is certain; and &s;o for the &s;ame Rea&s;on and End,
that other le&s;&s;er Circu|lation of the Liver is &s;lighted by the Blood,
which returns from the Placenta, by a Canal of Communication betwixt the
<HI>Porta</HI> and the <HI>Vena Cava.</HI></P>
<P>The Rea&s;on he gives of this, I can|not at all allow of; as being
very ill grounded; and therefore I &s;hall not trou|ble my &s;elf to Confute,
or &s;o much as Name it.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Heart of the Land Tortoi&s;e,</HI> it was pre&s;erved
in Spirit of Wine, and all the three Ventricles thereof &s;lit and opened; &s;o
that I had not all the Satis|faction I could have wi&s;ht: but the Left 
<PB N="67" REF="40">Ventricle in this Animal had no Artery belonging to it, but
did receive only the Blood, which de&s;cended from the Lungs, and convey it by
the <HI>Foramen Ovale</HI> into the Right Ventricle: That the third or middle
Ventricle was only an Appendix to the Right, and had the Pulmonick Ar|tery
i&s;&s;uing from it. So that the Blood in a <HI>Tortois</HI> was in a manner
Circulated like that in a <HI>Foetus,</HI> through the Body, the Lungs as it
were or in good part &s;lighted.</P>
<P>This Thought of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Merrie</HI>'s has made a great Breach
betwixt Mon&s;ieur <HI>Verney</HI> and him&s;elf; for which Rea&s;on I had not
that freedom of Conver&s;ation as I could have wi&s;ht with both of them; but
'tis to be hoped there may come good from an hone&s;t Emulation.</P>
<P>Two Engli&s;h Gentlemen came to Vi&s;it me, Mr. <HI>Bennis</HI> and
Mr. <HI>Probie:</HI> They were lodged near the Royal Garden, where Mon&s;ieur
<HI>Verney</HI> dwells, and makes his Anatomies, who in Three Months time
&s;hewed all the Parts of the Body to them. He had for this purpo&s;e at
lea&s;t Twenty Human Bodies, from the Gal|lows, the Chatelet, (where tho&s;e
are ex|pos'd who are found Murthered in the Streets, which is a very common
bu&s;ine&s;s at <HI>Paris</HI>) and from the Ho&s;pitals.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="41"> They told me, Mon&s;ieur <HI>Verney</HI>
pre|tended to &s;hew them a Valve, which did hinder Blood from falling back
into the Right Ventricle by the <HI>Foramen Ovale.</HI> This Valve they &s;aid
he compared to the Papillae in the Kidneys, Mu&s;culous and Fle&s;hy: That if
Wind was blown into the <HI>Vena Pulmonalis,</HI> it did not pa&s;s through the
<HI>Foramen Ovale,</HI> but &s;top there, by rea&s;on of the Valve. That he did
be|lieve, contrary to Mr. <HI>Merrie,</HI> that no Blood did circulate through
the Lungs in an Embrio.</P>
<P>Again, in another Conver&s;ation with Mon&s;ieur <HI>Merrie,</HI> he
&s;hewed me the blown Hearts of an Embrio, and that of a Girl of 7 years old. I
&s;aw clearly, that the Skin of the &s;uppo&s;ed Valve of the <HI>Fora|men
Ovale,</HI> was as it were &s;u&s;pended with two Ligaments: And that in the
Girl's, the two &s;ides of the <HI>Foramen Ovale</HI> were drawn one over the
other, and &s;o clo&s;ed the hole; but were ea&s;ily to be &s;epa|rated again
by a Bri&s;tle thru&s;t betwixt them.</P>
<P>Al&s;o it &s;eemed to me, that this Mem|brane in an Embrio might
cover the <HI>Fo|ramen Ovale,</HI> like the <HI>Membrana Nictans</HI> in a
Brids Eye, that is, be drawn over it, and &s;o hinder the Ingre&s;s of the
Blood from the <HI>Vena Cava,</HI> as oft as the Right Au|ricle 
<PB N="69" REF="41">beats: But the Dilating it &s;elf might give way to the
de&s;cending Blood of the <HI>Vena Pulmonalis;</HI> and po&s;&s;ibly, the
Em|brio living as it were the Life of an In|&s;ect, can by this Artifice
Command the Heart.</P>
<P>I remember in Di&s;cour&s;e that day with him, he told me, That
Mon&s;ieur <HI>Verney</HI> had an old <HI>Cat,</HI> and a young
<HI>Kitling</HI> ju&s;t Born, put into the Air-Pump before the <HI>Academie
Royalle des Sciences:</HI> That the Cat died after 16 Pumps, but the Kitling
&s;ur|vived 500 Pumps; which favours in &s;ome mea&s;ure the Command young
Ani|mals have of their Hearts.</P>
<P>At another Vi&s;it, Mon&s;ieur <HI>Merrie</HI> ob|ligingly procured
for me, the Heart of a Human Embrio, with the Lungs intire. He tried before me
the Experiment upon Blowing, and al&s;o Syringing Water into the
<HI>Aorta,</HI> both which filled the Auricles and Ventricles, and freely came
out at the <HI>Vena Cava</HI> only. Then he opened the Right Auricle and
Ventricle, where the <HI>Foramen Ovale</HI> was open only at one cor|ner, not
the tenth part of its breadth; and a Membrane drawn over the re&s;t, which
Membrane was fa&s;tned to the &s;ides quite round. Then he opened in the &s;ame
manner the Left Ventricle and Au|ricle, and there it was evident, that that 
<PB N="70" REF="42">Membrane which clo&s;ed the hole, had two narrow Straps or
Mu&s;cles by which it was fa&s;tned to the oppo&s;ite &s;ides, after the manner
of &s;ome of the Valves of the Heart.</P>
<P>I told him, that it mu&s;t follow from this, that the <HI>Foramen
Ovale</HI> was &s;hut and opened more or le&s;s, at the plea&s;ure of the
Embrio, according to the Nece&s;&s;ities of Nature, and the quantity of Blood
that was to pa&s;s: That it was probable, that all In&s;ects had a Command of
their Hearts, (of which I had given large In|&s;tances el&s;ewhere) by &s;ome
&s;uch pa&s;&s;age, which they could &s;hut altogether, or in great part, as
they had a Mind, in Winter, in Fear, or Fa&s;ting for want of Food: That the
&s;hutting up of the pa&s;&s;age in Adult Animals was therefore done in an
in&s;tant, by drawing the Curtain fully, which could never be again drawn back
and opened, becau&s;e of the great torrent of Blood, which now entred the Right
Auricle, &s;topt it in that po&s;ture, which in time would altogether &s;tiffen
and lo&s;e its Motion of Relaxation. As a Hen, when &s;he Sleeps, draws over
the <HI>Mem|brana Nictans;</HI> and likewi&s;e when &s;he Dies, the &s;ame
Membrane covers all the Eye.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="42">Mr. <HI>Bennis</HI> procured me the Heart of a
Humane <HI>Foetus,</HI> which had but ju&s;t breath'd; the which I examined
with Mon&s;ieur <HI>Litre</HI> of <HI>Ca&s;tres</HI> in <HI>Languedoc,</HI>
another very Under&s;tanding and Dextrous Anatomi&s;t, and who Teaches Scholars
of all Nations the Practice of Anatomy. The Experiments here were repeated as
formerly de&s;cribed; Both Wind and Water pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Foramen
Ovale,</HI> both from the <HI>Vena Pulmonum,</HI> and from the <HI>Aorta.</HI>
That which I ob&s;erved in this Heart more particularly, was, That the Membrane
or Valve on the Left &s;ide of the <HI>Foramen Ovale</HI> was flat, and
extended almo&s;t over the hole, without any <HI>Limbus</HI> round its edges,
becau&s;e it was nothing but the very &s;ub&s;tance of the <HI>Auricula
Sini&s;tra</HI> continued, or a Proce&s;s thereof: But on the right &s;ide the
<HI>Vena Cava</HI> being joined to the Auricle, it had a ri&s;ing edge round
that part of it, whence it proceeded; that is, that the two Faces had contrery
openings, and being drawn as it were one over the other, they &s;hut the hole;
but not &s;o firmly, but the hole might be more or le&s;s open all a Man's
Life. For tho&s;e two Oval Proce&s;&s;es &s;ticking clo&s;e together in a blown
and dried Heart, that is not to be much heeded, for I have &s;een them dry with
<PB N="72" REF="43">the hole open; but it has been like as betwixt unglued
Paper, or as the Ure|thers de&s;cend betwixt the Skins of the Bladder, or as
the &s;ame happens to the <HI>Ductus Bilaris</HI> in its in&s;ertion into the
Guts.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Per&s;on brought me the Heart of a Man 40 years old, in
which the <HI>Foramen Ovale</HI> was as much open, as in a <HI>Foetus</HI> new
born; and the Ligaments very con&s;picuous, which tack the &s;ides of the Valve
to the Auricle, and go over to the other &s;ide of the Border.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>F. Plumier.</HI></NOTE>I was not better

<HI>America,</HI> at his return Printed, at the King's Charge, a Book of
<HI>American</HI> Plants in Folio. This Book was &s;o well approved of, that he
was &s;ent again thither at the King's Charge, and returned after &s;everal
years <PB N="73" REF="43">wandring about the I&s;lands with this Cargo. He was
more than once Ship|wrackt, and lo&s;t his <HI>Specimens</HI> of all things,
but pre&s;erved his Papers, as ha|ving fortunately lodged them in other
Ve&s;|&s;els; &s;o that the things them&s;elves I did not &s;ee. He had
de&s;igned and Di&s;&s;ected a Crocodile; one of the Sea Tortoi&s;es; a Viper,
and well de&s;cribed the Di&s;&s;ecti|ons.</P>
<P>His Birds al&s;o were well under&s;tood, and very well painted in
their proper colours. I took notice of 3 &s;orts of Owles, one with Horns, all
di&s;tinct Species from our <HI>European.</HI> Several of the Hawk Kind and
Falcons of very beautiful Plumage; and one of tho&s;e, which was Coal black as
a Raven. Al&s;o (which I longed to &s;ee) there was one Species of the Swallow
Kind, very di&s;tinct from the 4 Species we have in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Among&s;t the Fi&s;h there were two new Species of <HI>American</HI>
Trouts, well known by the Fle&s;hy Fin near the Tail.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the In&s;ects there was a <HI>Scolo|pendra</HI> of a foot
and an half long, and proportionably broad. Al&s;o the <HI>Julus</HI> very
elegantly painted, which I had &s;een before in Dr. <HI>Turnfort</HI>'s

<P>Al&s;o a very large Wood-Frog, with the extremity of the Toes
webbed.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="44">Al&s;o a Blood-red <HI>Polypus,</HI> with very
long Legs, two of which I could di&s;cern by the Draught were thick
<HI>acetabulated.</HI> This, he told me, was &s;o venemous, that upon the
lea&s;t touch it would cau&s;e an in&s;upportable burning pain, which would
la&s;t &s;everal hours.</P>
<P>There were al&s;o &s;ome few Species of the Serpent and Lizard
Kind.</P>
<P>There were but few <HI>Shells;</HI> but among&s;t them there was a
<HI>Murex</HI> (See <HI>T.</HI> 4.) which dies purple, with the Fi&s;h as it
exerts it &s;elf in the Sea. Al&s;o that Land <HI>Buccinum</HI> (&s;ee
<HI>Tab.</HI> 3.) which I have figured, and which lays Eggs with hard Shells,
and for bigne&s;s, and &s;hape, and colour, &s;carce to be di&s;tingui&s;ht
from the Sparrow Eggs. And becau&s;e the <HI>Mu|rex</HI> and this
<HI>Buccinum</HI> was drawn with the Animals creeping out, I de&s;ired a Copy
of them, which he freely and in a mo&s;t obliging manner granted me; He
de&s;igned the <HI>Buccinum Terre&s;tre</HI> in the I&s;land of <HI>St.
Domingo,</HI> where he found it.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the va&s;t Collection of Plants, I ob&s;erved the Torch
Kind, and Fernes were of all others the mo&s;t numerous; of each of which there
were an incredi|ble number of Species. There were 2 or 3 Species of Goosberries
and Currants; and &s;ome Species of Wild Grapes; all <PB N="75" REF="44">which
<HI>F. Plumier</HI> told me were good to eat.</P>
<P>He told me the&s;e Drawings would make 10 Books, as big as that he
had publi&s;ht; and Two Books of Animals: He had been often at
<HI>Ver&s;ailles</HI> to get them into the Kings <HI>Imprimerie;</HI> but as

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI>But|terfield.</HI></NOTE>Mr.
<HI>Butterfield</HI> is a right hearty hone&s;t <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> who has
re&s;ided in <HI>France</HI> 35 years, is a very excellent Arti&s;t in making
all &s;orts of Mathematical In&s;tru|ments, and works for the King and all the
Princes of the Blood, and his Work is &s;ought after by all the Nations of
<HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>He more than once &s;hewed me (which is his great Diver&s;ion) a
mighty Collection of Load&s;tones, to the value of &s;everal Hundred Pounds
<HI>Sterling.</HI></P>
<P>Some he had as hard almo&s;t as Steel, and others &s;oft and
friable; yet of the&s;e he had tho&s;e which were of as great virtue, as any of
the hard; That of the equally hard there were very great difference.</P>
<P>He had one which weighed naked not above a Drachm, and would naked
take up a Drachm and an half; but &s;hod would take up 144 Drachms of Iron, if
rightly applied, that is, if the Iron to be taken up did firmly and in a plain
touch alike both the Feet.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="47">The be&s;t Shod were the&s;e that follow.</P>
<P>1. A <HI>Slate Load&s;tone,</HI> which I noted not &s;o much for its
&s;trength, but be|cau&s;e of its peculiar make, being fairly and di&s;tinctly
luminous throughout, weighing One ounce and an half, draws up One pound.</P>
<P>2. A Smooth Load&s;tone, weighing One drachm, two &s;cruples,
fourteen grains, draws up Eighteen ounces, that is Eighty two times its
weight.</P>
<P>3. Another Smooth Load&s;tone, weigh|ing Sixty five grains, draws up
Fourteen ounces, that is, One hundred and forty four times its weight.</P>
<P>There is, a Load&s;tone no bigger then a Hazel Nut, which took up a
huge Bunch of Keys.</P>
<P>We have a very large Slate Load&s;tone in the Repo&s;itory at
<HI>Gre&s;ham-Colledge,</HI> at lea&s;t 6 inches over; This al&s;o is but weak;
Whether the <HI>Laminae</HI> do &s;poil the vertue, as though they were but
&s;o many di&s;tinct Stones packt together. And yet a Load&s;tone which takes
up <HI>ex. gr.</HI> 6 pound weight, cut by the Axis in two halves, and both
halves &s;hod again, will take up 8 pound.</P>
<P>It is plain, that Experiments are bet|ter made with a
<HI>Terrella,</HI> or &s;pherical Load|&s;tone, than a &s;quare one; and his
way <PB N="82" REF="48">of capping the <HI>Terrella</HI> is very well
con|trived.</P>
<P>A &s;quare Load&s;tone made into a <HI>Ter|rella,</HI> will near
take up as much weight as it did before, though a great deal of the Stone is
lo&s;t in the rounding, by virtue of the different &s;hooing.</P>
<P>He entertained us full two hours with Experiments neatly contrived
about the effects of the Load&s;tone.</P>
<P>The Experiment of approaching a Load|&s;tone to the Spring of a
Watch is very fine; it cau&s;es the Ballance to move very &s;wift, and brought
yet nearer, to &s;top quite and cea&s;e moving.</P>
<P>Another Experiment was an inch broad Plate of Iron, turned into a
Ring of about 4 inches diameter, which had evi|dently two North and two South
Poles, which he &s;aid he had &s;een in a Load&s;tone, and had contrived this
in imitation of Nature. The working of them with fi|lings of Steel, drigged
upon a Plate, &s;et upon the Ring, did clearly manife&s;t the double
Polarity.</P>
<P>Al&s;o the &s;u&s;pending of a Needle in the Air, and a Ball of
Steel upon the point of it, by a Thred, which a weight kept down, that it could
not a&s;cend higher, than &s;uch a di&s;tance within the &s;phere of the
activity of the Load&s;tone.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="48">Again, the free working of the Needle in Water,
through Bra&s;s, Gold, Stone, Wood, or any thing but Iron. He told us, he had a
Stone, which would work through a Stone Wall of 18 inches.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, he demon&s;trated by many Ex|periments, how the
<HI>Effluvia</HI> of the Load|&s;tone work in a Circle, that is, what flows
from the North Pole, comes round, and enters the South Pole; on the con|trary,
what flows from the South Pole, enters the North, and in its way puts in order
all &s;uch Filings of Steel it meets with; that is, according to the
di&s;po&s;iti|on of its own whirling, and the circular lines it keeps in its
flying about the Load|&s;tone. Indeed, it is plea&s;ant to &s;ee, how the Steel
Filings are di&s;po&s;ed; and in their arangement one clearly &s;ees a per|fect
image of the road, which the whirl|ing invi&s;ible Matter takes in coming
forth, and re-entring the Poles of the Load|&s;tone.</P>
<P>He &s;hewed us a Load&s;tone &s;awed off that piece of the Iron Bar,
which held the Stones together at the very top of the Steeple of
<HI>Chartres;</HI> This was a thick Cru&s;t of Ru&s;t, part of which was turned
into a &s;trong Load&s;tone, and had all the properties of a Stone dug out of
the Mine. <HI>Man&s;. de la Hire</HI> has Printed a <PB N="84" REF="49">Memoire
of it; al&s;o Mon&s;. <HI>de Vallemont</HI> a Treati&s;e. The very outward
Ru&s;t had no Magnetic Virtue, but the inward had a &s;trong one, as to take up
a third part more than its weight un&s;hod. This Iron had the very grain of a
&s;olid Magnet, and the brittlene&s;s of a Stone.</P>
<P>The&s;e Gentlemen, who have writ of this, have, in my Opinion,
mi&s;s'd their purpo&s;e, when they enquire, how it comes to pa&s;s to be thus
turned; for it is certain, all Iron will in time go back into its Mineral
Nature again, notwith|&s;tanding the Artifice of Melting and Hammering. I have
&s;een of tho&s;e Ham|mered <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Cannon, which had lain many
years buried in the Ground, under the old Fort at <HI>Hull</HI> in
<HI>Yorke&s;hire,</HI> which were thoroughly turned into brittle Iron Stone, or
Mine again; and would not own the Load&s;tone, no more than the re&s;t of our
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Iron Mine, till it was calcined, and then &s;hewed it &s;elf
to be good Iron again. Al&s;o I have &s;een, and had by me, a piece of Wood
taken out of <HI>Lough-Neagh</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> which was not only good
Iron Mine, but a Load&s;tone too; &s;o that it is evident, Nature, in this
&s;ort of Mine, goes backwards and for|wards, is generated and regenerated; and
therefore Mon&s;. <HI>de la Hire</HI> has well <PB N="85" REF="49">u&s;ed the
Term of Vegetation in this Affair, which I had done many years be|fore in my

and has accounted for the&s;e and many more Experiments of this Nature, which
he had &s;hewn him by Mr. <HI>Butter|field,</HI> whom he mentions very
Honour|ably.</P>
<P>And yet after all, the nature of the&s;e <HI>Effluvia</HI> are
little known, and what is &s;aid by <HI>Des Cartes</HI> of Screw fa&s;hioned
Particles, and the invi&s;ible Channels and Pores and Pipes of the Load&s;tone,
are all meer Fancies without any Founda|tion in Nature. It is well called by
&s;ome a certain Magnetick Matter, but <PB N="86" REF="50">what properties it
hath, is little under|&s;tood.</P>
<P>It is very &s;trange to me, that a little Load&s;tone, of that
prodigious force, &s;hould have &s;o &s;hort a &s;phere of activity, and not
&s;en&s;ibly to affect Iron above an inch or two; and the bigge&s;t and
&s;trong|e&s;t not above a foot or two. We &s;ee the Vortices in Water, how
wide they work round about them, va&s;tly increa&s;|ing the Circles; and what
little re&s;i|&s;tance the Air can make to a body of that &s;ubtilty, as the
<HI>Effluvia</HI> of the Load|&s;tone, which can with ea&s;e penetrate all
Bodies what&s;oever, Marble, Flints, Gla&s;s, Copper, Gold, without any
&s;en&s;ible di|minution of its virtue. Again, we &s;ee the Flame of a Lamp in
Oil, or Tallow, or Wax, how &s;hort it is; and how long and tapering it is in
Spirit of Wine. If therefore the Magnetick Matter was darted out of infinite
&s;mall Pipes, and was of the nature of a more &s;ubtile and invi&s;ible Flame,
why does it not conti|nue its cour&s;e in a direct line to a great length, but
return &s;o &s;uddenly? We &s;ee the per&s;piration of our Skins to ri&s;e into
the Air, and continue to mount which yet has but a weak impul&s;e from the
Heart, being interrupted and broke off, when it comes out of the Road of the 
<PB N="87" REF="50">Blood into the <HI>Ductus Excretorii.</HI> But the Circle
of the Magnetick Matter is without any impul&s;e, that we know of, from the
Stone; and moves in a double circle, and with a double and contrary &s;tream in
the &s;ame Pipes, contrary to the Laws of the Circulation of the Blood in
Animals; which has naturally but one Currant, and one Road round; for the whole
Ma&s;s of Ve&s;&s;els, in which the Circulation of the Blood is concerned, is
but one continued Pipe.</P>
<P>Until the Nature of the <HI>Effluvia</HI> is bet|ter known, no very
&s;atisfactory Account can be given of the mo&s;t common Phoe|nomena of the
Load&s;tone, <HI>ex. gr.</HI> why it does not draw to it all Bodies alike? why
a great Load&s;tone, though weak, extends its vertue much farther, than a
&s;mall one, though &s;trong? Why a Load|&s;tone communicates its vertue to
Iron, as &s;oon as it touches it, nay even at &s;ome di&s;tance, and gives it
the properties of a Load&s;tone.</P>
<P>The Truth is, the Earth's being a great Magnet &s;eems to me a meer
Vi&s;ion and Fable; for this rea&s;on, becau&s;e it is not Iron. 'Tis true,
Iron Mine is the mo&s;t common of all Minerals, and found al|mo&s;t in all
places; but it holds not any proportion with the re&s;t of the Fo&s;&s;ils of 
<PB N="88" REF="51">the Earth; and is not, at a gue&s;s, as a million to other
Fo&s;&s;ils; This &s;eems evi|dent to any one, who has well con&s;ider|ed the
Chalky Mountains and Cliffs, the high Rag-&s;tone Mountains and Lime Stone
Cliffs, the &s;everal Quarries and Pits &s;unk in|to the Bowels of the Earth
for Coal, and Lead, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> how little Iron there is to be found in
compari&s;on of other Matters. Add to this, that very little of that very Iron
Mine, which is to be found any where, is Magnetick, or capable of obe|dience to
the Magnet, till it is calcined: Whence therefore &s;hould all tho&s;e
Magne|tick <HI>Effluvia</HI> ari&s;e, which are &s;uppo&s;ed every where
plentifully to incompa&s;s the Earth? And why &s;hould they be &s;up|po&s;ed to
be every where wandring in the Air, &s;ince 'tis evident, they make ha&s;te to
return to the Stone that emitted them, and are as afraid to leave it, as the
Child the Mother before it can go?</P>
<P>Towards the di&s;covery of the Nature of the <HI>Effluvia</HI> of
the Load&s;tone, &s;uch Particulars as tho&s;e, in my Opinion, ought chiefly to
be con&s;idered, and pro|&s;ecuted with all indu&s;try. The Load|&s;tone is
very good, if not the be&s;t Iron Mine. The &s;ole Fu&s;ion of the Load&s;tone
turns it into Iron; The Fire de&s;troys its very virtue, and &s;o does
Vitrification <PB N="89" REF="51">Iron. Fire will make Iron Mine own the
Load&s;tone, and turn to a Magnet; Ru&s;t, (into which all Iron will naturally
turn) and the reduction of Iron again to its Mine, will take away all the
Mag|netick capacity of Iron. A Load&s;tone cannot be made to alter its Poles,
but Iron may; nor be de&s;troyed, but by the Fire. A great and long Bar of Iron
is naturally a Load&s;tone, if held up perpen|dicularly, and it changes its
Poles at the plea&s;ure of him that holds it: A &s;trong Load&s;tone lo&s;es
much of its virtue by touching Iron, but after a few days re|covers it again: A
&s;mall and weak Load|&s;tone cannot touch to give its virtue to a great lump
of Iron: A Load&s;tone ex|po&s;ed to the Air is &s;poilt in time: The deeper
the Vein of Iron Mine is, where Load&s;tone is found, the better the Stone, and
how far, this holds true; for I do not doubt, but a very hard Stone may be
found near the day, as well as deeper: A Ruler or long Plate of Steel is much
better touched with the virtue of the Load&s;tone, than a Plate of meer Iron of
the &s;ame figure; but on the contrary a Plate of Iron &s;ticks much fa&s;ter
to the Load&s;tone, than a Plate of Steel; &s;o as if a Load&s;tone draws up a
Plate of Steel of 3 Ounces, it will draw up a Plate of <PB N="90" REF="52">Iron
of four Ounces and more. Why Iron fa&s;tned to the Poles of a Magnet does &s;o
va&s;tly improve its &s;trength, as to be 150 times &s;tronger than when
Naked.</P>
<P>Since therefore a Load&s;tone is nothing el&s;e but good Iron Mine,
and may be turned into Iron; and Iron mo&s;t ea&s;ily, and of its &s;elf into
Load-Stone, the way to find out the Nature of tho&s;e <HI>Magnetick
Effluvia,</HI> &s;eems to be to enquire &s;trictly into the Na|ture of Iron
Mine, and Iron it &s;elf; and not to run giddily into Hypothe&s;es, before we
are well &s;tocked with the Natural Hi&s;tory of the Load-Stone, and a larger
quantity of Experiments and Ob&s;ervati|ons relating to Iron and its Mine, with
all the Difference and Species of them; which I think has hitherto been little
heeded. For Nature will be its own In|terpreter, in this, as well as in all
other Matters of Natural Philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Butterfield,</HI> in another Conver&s;a|tion, told me, He
had ob&s;erved Load-Stones, which were &s;trong without arm|ing; and being
armed, had not that great advantage by it, as one could have expected: And that
on the contrary, there were others, which had a more incredible Virtue when
armed, than they did promi&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="52">That it &s;eldom happens, that a Load-Stone hath
as much Virtue in one of its Poles, as in the other; and that a bit of Iron is
toucht equally well at either of the Poles of one and the &s;ame
Load-Stone.</P>
<P>That there are Load-Stones which take up much, and which
notwith&s;tanding are incapable of well touching Iron; &s;o that a Stone armed,
which takes up &s;even Pound, yet cannot Communicate to a Ruler of Iron, the
Virtue of taking up a very &s;mall Needle.</P>
<P>That a Load-Stone of 10 Ounces, be|ing reduced to the weight of 6
Ounces or thereabouts, did almo&s;t the &s;ame effect as before,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I cau&s;ed Mr. <HI>Butterfield</HI> to make the <HI>Slate
Load-Stone</HI> into a <HI>Terella,</HI> and when &s;hod, it was indeed but of
little force; but I ob&s;erved its Poles to lie level with the
<HI>Laminae,</HI> of which it was compo&s;ed.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> A &s;trong Load-Stone ought to have large Irons, and
a weak one but thin Irons; &s;o that a Stone may be over-&s;hod.</P>

<P>In the King's Library I was &s;hewn an Ancient <HI>Greek MS. of
Dio&s;corides,</HI> writ in a &s;ort of thin or narrow Capitals, with the
Plants painted in Water-co|lours; but the fir&s;t Book was wholly wanting, and
therefore the <HI>Animals</HI> not there, which yet was what I mo&s;t de&s;ired

<P>In the &s;ame Room al&s;o we were &s;hewn the Epi&s;tles; which was
one part of the &s;ame MS. which we have at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> which is the
Go&s;pels only. <HI>Beza</HI> was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of ours, from whom we had
it. It is written in <HI>&s;quare Capitals,</HI> and very &s;hort Lines, and
much worn out in ma|ny places. This comes much &s;hort of the
<HI>Alexandrian</HI> MS. at <HI>St. James's</HI> for Beauty and Antiquity.</P>
<P>There was another <HI>MS. of the Go&s;pel of St. Matthew,</HI> which
was but of late di&s;|covered; a very fair Volume in a large Folio. This was
cut to pieces in the back, and had been &s;huffled and bound up again; and
another Book overwritten in a &s;mall Modern <HI>Greek</HI> Hand, about 150
years ago. The fir&s;t Writing was turned &s;o pale, that they took no pains to
rub it out. One of the Library Keep|ers ob&s;erving this, hath reduced it again
by paging it a-new; and with a little heeding 'tis yet very legible. The Letter
is as fair a &s;quare Capital as any I have &s;een. There are &s;ome
Interpretations ve|ry notorious, as about the De&s;cent of the &s;ick Man into
the Pool of <HI>Bethe&s;da;</HI> <PB N="109" REF="61">which I &s;uppo&s;e will

<P>I ob&s;erved the <HI>China</HI> Manu&s;cripts which Father
<HI>Beauvais</HI> brought this year as a Pre&s;ent to the King. They are about
44 Packs of &s;mall Books, of a long Quarto fa&s;hion, put up in loo&s;e Covers

Dictionaries relating to the Expo&s;ition of their Characters,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The King had a Sett much of the &s;ame before in White-Sattin, with
their Ti|tles.</P>
<P>Here al&s;o I &s;ee the 3d Decade of <HI>Livy,</HI> a large Quarto
in Vellum, without Di|&s;tinction of Words in fair large Capitals. It is
&s;uppo&s;ed by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Baluze</HI> to be 1100 year old.</P>
<P>Yet the Manu&s;cript of <HI>Prudentius Hym|nes,</HI> which was
al&s;o &s;hewed us, is a much fairer Letter, and therefore thought to be older
by one Century at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>Here al&s;o I &s;aw a famous <HI>Latin Roll</HI> or Volume written
of Aegyptian Paper, In|tituled, <HI>Charta Plenariae Securitatis,</HI> taken
the 38th years of <HI>Ju&s;tinian;</HI> it is fanly Ingraved and Interpreted
Letter by Letter upon Copper by <HI>Mon&s;ieur Thevenot.</HI> I &s;aw the Print
thereof: It is writ long|ways the Roll and not cro&s;s; in three Columns: The
Column in the middle is <PB N="110" REF="62">three times as long as the two end
Co|lumns. The Roll is not above a foot broad.</P>
<P>They &s;hewed us al&s;o in this Hou&s;e, the Apartment of Mon&s;ieur
<HI>Hugeins,</HI> which was very Noble, and well for Air, upon the Garden: But
here he fell Melanchol|ly, and Died of it in <HI>Holland.</HI> He &s;hewed the
fir&s;t Tokens of it by playing with a Tame Sparrow, and neglecting his
Ma|thematick Schemes. 'Tis certain, Life and Health of Body and Mind are not to
be pre&s;erved but by the Relaxation, and un|bending the Mind by Innocent
Diver&s;ions. For Sleep is nothing el&s;e that I know off, but the giving up
the Reins, and letting Nature to Act alone, and to put her in full
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Body. We have a convincing in&s;tance of this, in
being a Bed awake: No Man can lie &s;till 3 Mi|nutes without turning; and if it
come not pre&s;ently upon us, we mu&s;t turn a|gain and again; and at length we
be|come &s;o intolerably weary, that our Bed is a very wrack to us. Whereas, if
we chance to fall a &s;leep, though we lie in one and the &s;ame po&s;ture 7
hours, we &s;hall Wake fre&s;h and without pain, as tho' the Body did not weigh
at all upon it &s;elf in Sleep. 'Tis certain, the Nerves and Mu&s;cles are in
little or no Ten&s;ion <PB N="111" REF="62">in Sleep; but when we are awake,
are always &s;tretch'd and compre&s;&s;ed, whence wearine&s;s: which, if upon
our Feet or Sitting, we are not &s;en&s;ible off, becau&s;e we remove quick and
with ea&s;e, and of cour&s;e; but laid, we &s;oon find our &s;elves very
unea&s;ie, till we change the po&s;ture.</P>
<P>But this is not all in the King's Library: There are other things to
be &s;een, <HI>viz.</HI> A con&s;iderable number of Ancient Roman and Aegyptian
Antiquities; as, <HI>Lamps, Pateras,</HI> and other Ve&s;&s;els belonging to
the Sacrifices; A <HI>Si&s;trum</HI> or Aegyptian Rattle with three loo&s;e and
running Wires cro&s;s it.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the great variety of <HI>Aegyptian Idols,</HI> there was
one betwixt 2 and 3 foot long of Black Touch-&s;tone, with Hiero|glyphicks
ingraven down before. I took particular notice of the Grain of this Stone; and
at my return, having had the Honour of a Paper from Mr. <HI>Molyneux</HI> from
<HI>Dublin,</HI> giving an account of the va&s;t and &s;tupendious <HI>Natural
Pillars</HI> to be &s;een in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and that the Stones or Joints
which con&s;titute the&s;e Pillars, are of the <HI>Lapis Lydius,</HI> or
<HI>Ba&s;altes</HI> Kind, ha|ving &s;een one of the Joints at

the <HI>Peble Kind</HI> &s;hould produce &s;uch regular Figures; which is

In this I &s;aw the <HI>P&s;alter,</HI> as it is believed, of <HI>St.

being a large Quarto of fine purple Velom, and on it are writ the

by Shreds of Parchmen; The Rims were a little rai&s;ed, with a flat and broad
Bor|der, the better to pre&s;erve the black Wax, which was &s;pread over them.
I &s;aw more of the&s;e afterwards in the King's Library; and by the Letter it
is manife&s;t, they were in u&s;e much later, than I could have imagined. This

<P>In another Conver&s;ation I had with <HI>P. Mabillon,</HI> (for he

brought us of <HI>Palmyra,</HI> and the Tracts that were writ of it, and that
more was intended to be pub|li&s;ht about it, he was much concerned, that
tho&s;e Accounts, which were pure Matters of Learning in general, were written
in <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and he told me, he was afraid it might be with us, as it
was with them, &s;ince they cultivated their own Language &s;o much, they began
to neglect the ancient Tongues, the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin.</HI></P>
<P>He &s;hewed me certain Figures not ill taken with Red Chalk, of

the Mountain, called <HI>La Vauge,</HI> betwixt <HI>Al|&s;ace</HI> and
<HI>Lorraine.</HI> There were great Re|mains of an ancient City. The&s;e
Fi|gures which the Fathers &s;hewed me, were about 12 in all; but 5 or 6 of
them were of <HI>Mercury;</HI> and Cock at his Foot; a <HI>Chla|mys</HI>

Hair laid in curles about his Face, and tied with a Ribban, who&s;e two ends

Hand, which was very differently repre&s;ented in all the Figures of him;
&s;ometimes held up, othertimes the point re&s;ting at his Feet; &s;ometimes
the Snakes were twi&s;ted about a Stick; and again in others without one, or
the De&s;igner had taken no notice of it; &s;ome|times the Tail of the Serpents
&s;pread and flying about, and again in others clo&s;e twi&s;ted with many
braids; a Girdle came round the bottom of his Belly, and which had in the
middle of it two Rings, one fa&s;tned to the other, and hanging be|twixt his
Legs. The&s;e many <HI>Statues</HI> of <HI>Mercury</HI> in a <HI>French</HI>

<P><HI>As qua&s;i Aes;</HI> This is very rea&s;onable, for before the

Points, and the Screw fills the Ball of his Hand. One of the Points was the
Point of a Bodkin, which was to Write on Waxed Tables: The other Point was made
very Artificially, like the Head and Upper-Beak of a Cock, and the Point
divided in two, ju&s;t like our <HI>Steel-Pens;</HI> from whence undoubtedly

the mo&s;t la&s;ting of all Inks, it never ru&s;ts the Pen, but rather

<P><PB N="132" REF="73">After an hours di&s;cour&s;e, he carried me
into the <HI>Publick Library</HI> of the Hou&s;e: A fair Gallery well lighted,

Manu&s;cripts, where were many Greek and Hebrew. Among&s;t the re&s;t, the

by.</P>
<P>They were bu&s;ie in Reforming the Di&s;po&s;ition of the Library;
and making a good Catalogue, according to the Me|thod of the late Archbi&s;hop
of <HI>Rheims;</HI> and which I like well of, they had drawn out &s;ome
Hundreds of Books, and expo&s;ed them in the middle of the Li|brary, upon a

furni&s;h them&s;elves with what they wanted.</P>
<P>The Books which were written by Prote&s;tants, I ob&s;erved, they
were lockt up in Wired Ca&s;es, not to be come at without particular leave.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="73">The Freedom and Nature of this Order puts me in
mind of what I heard of a certain rich and learned Man, Mon&s;ieur
<HI>Pinet,</HI> of the Law; who put him&s;elf at length into Religion, as they
&s;ay, among&s;t the Fathers; but fir&s;t per&s;uaded his Cook to do &s;o too;
for he was re&s;olved not to quit his good Soupes, and &s;uch Di&s;hes as he
liked, whatever became of his Penance and Retirement. This Compliment the
Elegant and Learned Mon&s;ieur <HI>Peletier,</HI> in Mon&s;ieur
<HI>Colbert</HI>'s place, Controller Gene|ral of the <HI>Finances,</HI> made
his Gue&s;ts at his Country Hou&s;e near <HI>Choi&s;y,</HI> having voluntarily
quitted all his Imployments at Court: He &s;aid, He re&s;erved his Cook, tho'
he retrencht the re&s;t of his Retinue; they might therefore expect a &s;lender
Phi|lo&s;ophers Dinner, tho' well dre&s;t.</P>
<P>It is wonderful to con&s;ider how mo&s;t of the re&s;t of the Orders
<HI>abu&s;e</HI> them&s;elves for God's Sake, as they call it. Hunger and
Ill-Diet not only de&s;troys a Man's Health, but Maugre all his Devotion, puts
him out of Humour, and makes him Repine and Envy the re&s;t of Man|kind; and
well if it do not make him al&s;o Cur&s;e in his Heart his Maker; <HI>Job</HI>
is not every Man's Roll to Act. The Original and Ri&s;e of Natural Philo&s;ophy
<PB N="134" REF="74">and Phy&s;ick was to Invent a more whol|&s;ome and better
Food, than the Bea&s;ts have, and to Eat Bread and Fle&s;h in&s;tead of Herbs
and Corn; to Drink Wine in|&s;tead of Water; tho&s;e, and a thou&s;and other
things were the Ble&s;&s;ings of Phy&s;ick, and &s;till the good management of
the&s;e things, both in Health and Sickne&s;s, are under the Directions of the
Phy&s;itians. Now for a &s;ort of <HI>Melancholly</HI> and <HI>Willful
Men,</HI> to renounce the&s;e Comforts, and de&s;troy their Healths, and all
this upon a pretended Principle of Religion and De|votion, &s;eems to me, I
confe&s;s, great In|gratitude to God the Author of it.</P>
<P>Indeed, I heartily pitied <HI>F. P.</HI> an in|du&s;trious hone&s;t
Man, after his return from the <HI>Indies,</HI> who was nothing but Skin and
Bone; and yet by the Rules of his Order he could not Eat any thing that was
whol&s;ome and proper for his Cure; nothing but a little &s;limy na&s;ty Fi&s;h
and Herbs: And tho' he took, as he told me, <HI>Hypocochoana</HI> five times,
it had no effect upon him. 'Tis true, I never heard him complain; But what will
not blind prejudice do again&s;t all the Rea&s;on of Mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="74">I know &s;ome of the&s;e Men have been u&s;eful
to Mankind by their Studies; but the very &s;ame men would have been much more,
had they &s;taid with their Neighbours, and Taught the World by their
Conver&s;ation and Example; Wi&s;|dom, and Ju&s;tice, and Innocence, and
Temperance, which they highly pretend to, are not things to be hid in Corners,
but to be brought forth to In&s;truct and Adorn the Age we live in: To abandon
the World, and all the Conveniencies of Life and Health, is (let them &s;ay
what they plea&s;e) the height of Chagrin, and not Religion.</P>
<P>There were &s;ome other Publick Libra|ries I &s;aw, as that of the
<HI>Grands Augu|&s;tins,</HI> Colledge <HI>Mazarin,</HI> Colledge
<HI>Navarre,</HI> and great many more I did not &s;ee for want of an
opportunity; but there is nothing particular I remember about them.</P>
<P>There is &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ion of &s;etting up for Libraries, that
Books are come to mo&s;t unrea&s;onable Rates.</P>
<P>I paid to <HI>Ani&s;&s;on</HI> 36 Livres for <HI>Nizo|lius;</HI> 20
Livres for the Two &s;mall Quar|to's of the Memoirs of the <HI>Academie de
Sciences,</HI> that is, as I may &s;ay, for two years Philo&s;ophick
Tran&s;actions; for they began tho&s;e Monthly Memoirs in <PB N="136" REF="75">imitation of ours, out of the Regi&s;ters of the Academy, but did not
think fit to continue them above two years.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Stamps,</HI> I had a mind to have bought a compleat Set of
<HI>Melans,</HI> that in|comparable Ma&s;ter; but I was askt 200 Livres, and 12
excepted, which might amount to as much more; for &s;ome of his Gravings in
<HI>Octavo</HI> done at <HI>Rome,</HI> they askt me a Pi&s;tol a-piece; and for
the Head of <HI>Ju&s;tinianus</HI> a Louis; which yet is his
Ma&s;ter-piece.</P>
<P>I was at an Auction of Books in the <HI>Ru&euml; St. Jaques,</HI>
where were about 40 or 50 People, mo&s;t Abbots and Monks. The Books were
&s;old with a great deal of trifling and delay as with us, and very dear; for
<HI>Hi&s;pania illu&s;trata Aud. Sciotti,</HI> of the <HI>Francfort</HI>
Edition, from 20 Livres, at which it was &s;et, they bid up by little and
little to 36 Livres; at which it was &s;old. The next was a <HI>Catalogue of
French Books</HI> in a thin Fol. in an old Parchment Cover by <HI>De la Croix
de Maine,</HI> 8 Livres. And &s;o I left them to &s;hift it among&s;t
them&s;elves.</P>
<P>After having &s;aid &s;o much of the <HI>Pub|lick Libraries,</HI> I
cannot but congratulate their happine&s;s, to have them &s;o well &s;e|cured
from Fire; it being one of the Perfections of this City to be &s;o built and 
<PB N="137" REF="75">furni&s;ht, as not to have &s;uffered by it the&s;e many
Ages; and, indeed, I cannot &s;ee how Malice it &s;elf could de&s;troy them,
for the Hou&s;es here are all built of Stone, Walls, Floors, Stairca&s;es and
all, &s;ome few Rooms excepted; no Wain&s;cot; Woollen or Silk Hangings, which
can|not be fired without giving notice by the intolerable &s;tench, and the
&s;upply of much Fuel. 'Tis well for us in <HI>London,</HI> that there are very
few publick Libraries, and tho&s;e &s;mall and incon&s;iderable, and that the
great number of Books are di|&s;tributed into a thou&s;and hands, (no Country
in <HI>Europe</HI> can compare to us for private Libraries) for if they were
toge|ther in &s;uch va&s;t quantities as in <HI>Paris,</HI> Learning would run
the hazard of daily &s;uffering. Here with us, me-thinks, every Man that goes
to Bed, when a|&s;leep, lies like a dead <HI>Roman</HI> upon a Fu|neral Pile,
dreading &s;ome unexpected <HI>Apo|theo&s;is;</HI> for all is combu&s;tible
about him, and the Paint of the Deal Boards may &s;erve for Incen&s;e, the
quicker to burn him to A&s;hes.</P>
<P>In the next place I will Account for what I &s;aw, that &s;eemed to

&s;aw the <HI>Potterie of St. Clou,</HI> with which I was marvellou&s;ly well
plea&s;ed, for I confe&s;s I could not di&s;tingui&s;h be|twixt the Pots made
there, and the fine&s;t <HI>China Ware</HI> I ever &s;aw. It will, I know, be
ea&s;ily granted me, that the <HI>Paintings</HI> may be better de&s;igned and
fini&s;ht, (as indeed it was) becau&s;e our Men are far better Ma&s;ters in
that Art, than the <HI>Chi|ne&s;es;</HI> but the <HI>Glazing</HI> came not in
the lea&s;t behind theirs, not for whitene&s;s, nor the &s;moothne&s;s of
running without Bubles; again, the <HI>inward Sub&s;tance</HI> and Matter of
the Pots was, to me, the very &s;ame, hard and firm as Marble, and the &s;elf
&s;ame grain, <HI>on this &s;ide vitrification.</HI> Farther, the
<HI>Tran&s;parency</HI> of the Pots the very &s;ame.</P>
<P>I &s;ee them al&s;o in the Mold, undried, and before the Painting
and Glazing was applied, they were as white as Chalk, and melted upon the
Tongue like raw To|bacco Pipe Clay, and felt betwixt the Teeth &s;oft like
that, and very little grit|ty; &s;o that I doubt not, but they are made of that
very Clay.</P>
<P>As to the Temper of the Clay, the Man freely owned to me, it was 3
or 4 times well beaten and wet, before it was put to work on the Wheel; but I
believe <PB N="139" REF="76">it mu&s;t fir&s;t be melted in fair Water, and
carefully drawn off, that the heavie&s;t part may fir&s;t &s;ink; which al&s;o
may be proper for Cour&s;er Works.</P>
<P>That it required two, and &s;ometimes 3 or 4 Fires to bake it, to
that height we &s;aw it in the mo&s;t fini&s;ht Pots: Nay, &s;ome of them had
had 11 Fires.</P>
<P>I did not expect to have found it in this perfection, but imagined
this might have arrived at the <HI>Gomron Ware;</HI> which is, indeed, little
el&s;e, but a total Vitrifi|cation; but I found it far otherwi&s;e, and very
&s;urpri&s;ing, and which I account part of the felicity of the Age to equal,
if not &s;urpa&s;s the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> in their fine&s;t Art.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Red Ware</HI> for <HI>China,</HI> that has been, and
is done in <HI>England,</HI> to a far greater perfection than in
<HI>China,</HI> we ha|ving as good Materials, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Soft
Hae|matites,</HI> and far better Arti&s;ts in Pottery. But in this particular
we are beholding to two <HI>Dutchmen</HI> Brothers, who wrought in
<HI>Stafford&s;hire,</HI> (as I have been told) and were not long &s;ince at
<HI>Hammer&s;mith.</HI></P>
<P>They &s;old the&s;e Pots at <HI>St. Clou</HI> at ex|ce&s;&s;ive
Rates; and for their ordinary Cho|colate Cups askt Crowns a-piece. They had
arrived at the Burning on Gold in neat Chequer Works. He had &s;ome Fur|nitures
of Tea Tables at 400 Livres a Sett.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="77">There was no Molding or Model of <HI>China</HI>
Ware, which they had not imitat|ed; and had added many Fancies of their own,
which had their good effects, and appeared very beautiful.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. <HI>Morin</HI> in Conver&s;ation told me, that they kept
their Sand as a Secret to them&s;elves; but this could not be for o|ther
purpo&s;es than Colouring: Al&s;o he &s;aid they u&s;ed Salt of <HI>Kelp</HI>
in the Com|po&s;ition, and made a thing not unlike <HI>Frit</HI> for Gla&s;s to
be wrought up with White Clay; neither could this be, for I did not ta&s;te it

<P>There they are poli&s;hed; which Im|ploys daily 600 Men, and they
hope in a little time to employ a 1000 in &s;everal Galleries. In the lower
they grind the cour&s;e Gla&s;s with a Sand Stone, the very &s;ame they Pave
the Streets in <HI>Paris;</HI> of which broken they have great heaps in the
Courts of the Work-hou&s;es: This Stone is beat to Powder, and &s;ifted through
a fine Tamis. In the Upper Gallery, where they poli&s;h and give the la&s;t
Hand, they work in 3 Rowes, and 2 Men at a Plate, with Ruddle or Powdered
Haematites in Water.</P>
<P>The Gla&s;&s;es are &s;et fa&s;t in White Puttie, upon flat Tables
of Stone, &s;awed thin for that purpo&s;e. The grinding the Edges and Borders
is very trouble&s;ome, and odious for the horrid grating noi&s;e it makes, and
which cannot be endured to one that is not u&s;ed to it; and yet by long
cu&s;tom the&s;e Fellows are &s;o ea&s;ie with it, that they Di&s;cour&s;e

Bread, or <HI>Pain de Gone&s;&s;e,</HI> which is brought twice a week into

<P>The <HI>Gray Salt</HI> of <HI>France</HI> (which there, at Table,
is altogether in every thing made u&s;e of) is incomparably better and more

not yet to enter fully into the con|&s;ideration and knowledge of our People;
who are nice in this particular to a fault. But I mu&s;t take leave to tell
them, that our Salt &s;poils every thing, that is pre|tended to be pre&s;erved
by it, be it Fi&s;h or Fle&s;h. For whether boiled from the in|land Salt Pits,
or the Sea Water, it is little le&s;s than Quicklime, and burns and ree&s;es
all it touches; &s;o that 'tis pity to &s;ee &s;o much good Fi&s;h, as is
caught upon the Northern Line of Coa&s;t, particularly the God and Ling and
Herring, now of little value, which were formerly the mo&s;t e&s;teemed

fierce and vehement boiling, as is u&s;ed; but it mu&s;t be kerned either by
the heat of the Sun, as in <HI>France;</HI> or by a full and over-weighty
Brine, as at <HI>Milthrope</HI> in the <HI>Wa&s;hes</HI> of

Cellars, where they will keep good till after <HI>Ea&s;ter,</HI> nay, till
<HI>Whit&s;untide;</HI> Whereas if the Fro&s;t take them, they are quite

it had its Name; but there are &s;ome few of them that are yellow. They are
always of a round Pyramidal Figure, upon a &s;hort thick Foot-&s;talk; The
Foot|&s;talk is &s;mooth, but the out&s;ide of the Mu&s;hroom is all deeply
pleated and wrinkled like the in&s;ide of a Bea&s;ts Maw. The Moriglio &s;plit
in two from top to bottom is all hollow and &s;mooth, Foot, &s;talk, and all.
In this hollowne&s;s is &s;ome|times contained dangerous In&s;ects. The ta&s;te

that comes from eating them, is from the noxious In&s;ects and Vermin that feed

Beef, if they are good in their Kind, they come little &s;hort of ours, I

much Food of Milk and Meal, be&s;ides &s;ucking the Dam. By much Bleeding the

<P>I cannot but take notice here of a great Prejudice the
<HI>French</HI> lie under, in relation to our Fle&s;h; 'Tis generally &s;aid
among&s;t them, that our Meat in <HI>England</HI> will not make &s;o &s;trong
Broth, as the <HI>French,</HI> by a third part. If they &s;ay, not &s;o &s;alt
and &s;avoury, and &s;trong ta&s;ted, I agree with them; and yet the
<HI>French</HI> Meat <PB N="158" REF="86">is never the better. For fir&s;t
their Meat is mo&s;tly leaner and more dry, and (which is all in all in this
matter of Soupes) is long kept before it be &s;pent, which gives it a higher
and &s;alter ta&s;te; for as Meat rots, it becomes more urinous and &s;alt. Now
our People by cu&s;tom, covet the fre&s;he&s;t Meat, and cannot indure the
lea&s;t tendency to putrefaction; and we have good rea&s;on to do &s;o,
becau&s;e our Air is twice as moi&s;t as theirs, which does often cau&s;e in
the keeping of Meat a Mu&s;tine&s;s, which is intolerable to all Mankind;
whereas the Air of <HI>France</HI> be|ing &s;o much drier, keeping of Meat, not
only makes it tender, but improves the ta&s;te. So that could we &s;ecure our
Meat, in keeping it from that un&s;avoury qua|lity, it would far outdo the
<HI>French</HI> Meat, becau&s;e much more juicy.</P>
<P>I don't remember I eat of above two &s;orts of Fle&s;h, but what
we have as good or better in <HI>England,</HI> and that was of the Wild Pigs;

Bunches of Grapes, &s;o breaking the Stalks of them, that they receive no
longer any nouri&s;hment from the Vine, but hang down and dry in the then
violently hot Sun, and are in few days almo&s;t turned into Rai&s;ins of the
Sun; hence, from this in&s;olation, the flavour of the Grape is exceedingly
height|ned, and the &s;trength and oiline&s;s, and thick Body of the Wine is

&s;uffering much in tho&s;e tedious Campagnes, applied them|&s;elves to the&s;e

and at their return to <HI>Paris,</HI> introduced them to their Tables. Sure I
am, the <HI>Pari&s;ians,</HI> both Men and Wo|men, are &s;trangely altered in
their Con|&s;titutions and Habit of Body; from lean and &s;lender, they are

<HI>London:</HI> And the&s;e Sugar'd Liquors al&s;o add con|&s;iderably to
their Corpulency.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="90">I mu&s;t not forget, that among&s;t the

one. The be&s;t I drank of that Kind, was of the colour of Cla|ret, reddi&s;h
or brown; The Apple, that it was made of, was called <HI>Frequins,</HI> which
is round and yellow, but &s;o bitter, that it is not to be eaten; and yet the
Cyder that is made of it, is as &s;weet as any new Wine. It keeps many years
good, and mends of its colour and ta&s;te. I drank it often at a Private
Hou&s;e of a <HI>Norman</HI> Gentleman, of who&s;e Growth it was; otherwi&s;e,
if I had not have to the contrary, I could not have believed, but that it had
been mixt with Sugar.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o very many publick <HI>Coffee-hou&s;es,</HI> where
Tea al&s;o and Choco|late may be had, and all the Strongwa|ters and Wine
above-mentioned; and innumerable <HI>Alehou&s;es.</HI> I wonder at the great
change of this Sober Nation, in this particular; but Luxury like a Whirlpool
draws into it the Extravagances of other People.</P>
<P>'Twas Nece&s;&s;ity, and the want of Wine, (either naturally, as
in a great part of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and the <HI>Indies;</HI> or from their
Re|ligion, <PB N="167" REF="90">as in <HI>Turkey,</HI>) that put Men upon the
invention of tho&s;e Liquors of Coffee and Tea: Chocalate, indeed, was found
out by the poor &s;tarved <HI>Indians,</HI> as Ale was with us. But what el&s;e
but a Wan|ton Luxury could di&s;po&s;e the&s;e People, who abound in Excellent
Wines, the mo&s;t cordial and generous of all Drinks, to ape the nece&s;&s;ity
of others.</P>
<P>Mighty things, indeed, are &s;aid of the&s;e Drinks, according to
the Humour and Fancy of the Drinkers. I rather be|lieve they are permitted by
Gods Provi|dence for the le&s;&s;ening the number of Mankind by &s;hortning
Life, as a &s;ort of &s;ilent Plague. Tho&s;e that plead for Cho|colate, &s;ay,
it gives them a good Sto|mach, if taken two hours before Dinner. Right! who
doubts it? you &s;ay you are much more hungry having drunk Cho|colate, than you
had been if you had drunk none; that is, your Stomach is faint, craving and
feels hollow and empty, and you cannot &s;tay long for your Dinner. Things that
pa&s;s thus &s;oon out of the Stomach, I &s;u&s;pect are little welcome there,
and Nature makes ha&s;te to get &s;hut of them. There are many things of this
&s;ort which impo&s;e upon us by procuring a fal&s;e hunger.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="91">The Wild <HI>Indians,</HI> and &s;ome of our
People, no doubt dige&s;t it; but our Pampered Bodies can make little of it;
and it proves to mo&s;t tender Con&s;titu|tions perfect Phy&s;ic, at lea&s;t to

decays Na|ture.</P>
<P><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg"><HI>Gage.</HI></NOTE>It is very

the Churches, and the di&s;order could &s;carce be remedied.</P>
<P>The old <HI>Romans</HI> did better with their Luxury; they took
their Tea and Choco|late after a full Meal, and every Man was his own Cook in
that ca&s;e. <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> re&s;olved to be free, and eat and drink

<HI>Cicero</HI> tells his Friend <HI>Atticus,</HI> that before he lay down to
Table, <HI>Emeticen agebat,</HI> which I con&s;true, he prepared for him&s;elf

<P>There are two &s;orts of <HI>Water</HI> which they drink at

Buildings in and about <HI>Paris,</HI> and worth going to &s;ee: This noble
Canal of hewn Stone conveys the Water 15 miles to <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>The River Water is very pernicious to all Strangers, not the
<HI>French</HI> excepted, that come from any di&s;tance, but not to the Natives
of <HI>Paris,</HI> cau&s;ing Loo&s;ene&s;s, and &s;ometimes Dy&s;enteries. I am
apt to think, the many <HI>Ponds</HI> and <HI>Lakes</HI> that are let into it
to &s;upply the Sluces upon the Canal <HI>De Briare,</HI> are in part the
cau&s;e of it. But tho&s;e who are careful of them&s;elves purifie it by
filling their Ci&s;terns with Sand, and letting it &s;ink through it; which way
clears it, and makes it very cool and palatable.</P>
<P>As for the Spring Water from the <HI>Mai&s;on des Eaux,</HI> it is
whole&s;om in this re&s;pect, and keeps the Body firm; but it is very apt to
give the Stone, which the People of this Town are infinitely &s;ub|ject to. An
In&s;tance of this I had by chance, when coming from &s;eeing the <HI>Aqueduct
of Arcueil,</HI> in the very Road near the Wall of the <HI>Aqueduct,</HI> a
great number of Earthen Pipes, which had &s;erved to convey that Water to
&s;ome Hou&s;e, were ca&s;t to mend the High-ways. I ob&s;erved, that of 4
inches diameter the <PB N="170" REF="92">hollow of the Pipes were all &s;topt
up to the breadth of a Shilling, with a firm Stone petrified; &s;o that they
were forc'd to break up the Pipes being altogether u&s;ele&s;s. Now what
Petrifies in the Water-Pipes is apt in &s;ome weak Con&s;titutions to

upon as one of the very be&s;t. It is extreamly fine, and the Mu|&s;ick and
Singing admirable: The Stage large and magnificent, and well filled with
Actors: The Scenes well &s;uited to the thing, and as quick in the removal of

<P>It is to be wondered, that the&s;e Opera's are &s;o frequented:
There are great num|bers of the Nobility that come daily to them, and &s;ome
that can Sing them all: And it was one thing that was trouble|&s;ome to us
Strangers, to di&s;turb the Box by the&s;e voluntary Songs of &s;ome parts of

<P>The Di&s;po&s;ition of the Theatre is much the &s;ame; but
&s;omething le&s;s: And here the Stage it &s;elf is to be Let; where for
<HI>Strangers,</HI> the Places are mo&s;t commodious, to hear and &s;ee.</P>
<P>I heard many <HI>Tragedies,</HI> but without gu&s;t for want of
Language: But after them, the <HI>Little Plays</HI> were very Divert|ing to me,
particularly tho&s;e of <HI>Moliere, Vendange de Sure&s;ne, Pourcegnac,
Cri&s;pin Medecin, le Medecin malgre luy, le Malade Imaginaire,
&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="93">In this all agree, that tho'
<HI>Moliere</HI>'s Plays have <HI>le&s;s of Intrigue</HI> in them; yet his
<HI>Characters</HI> of Per&s;ons are incompara|ble, &s;o true and ju&s;t, that
nothing can be more: And for this Rea&s;on, &s;o many of them are only of two
or three Acts; for without an Intrigue well laid, the Characters would have
failed him, in which was his Excellency. However, this is now &s;o much become
a Cu&s;tom on the French Stage; that you ever have one of the&s;e little Pieces
tack'd to the Trage|dy, that you may plea&s;e your &s;elf accor|ding to your
Appetite.</P>
<P>'Tis &s;aid, <HI>Moliere</HI> Died &s;uddenly in Acting the
<HI>Malade Imaginaire:</HI> Which is a good in&s;tance of his well
Per&s;onating the Play he made, and how he could really put him&s;elf into any
Pa&s;&s;ion he had in his Head. Al&s;o of the great dan|ger &s;trong and
vehement Pa&s;&s;ions may cau&s;e in weak Con&s;titutions, &s;uch as Joy and
Fear; which Hi&s;tory tells us, have killed many very &s;uddenly. He is
re|ported to have &s;aid, going off the Stage, <HI>Me&s;&s;ieurs, Jay joue le
Malade Imaginaire; Mais je &s;uis veritablement fort Malade;</HI> and he died
within two hours after. This Account of <HI>Moliere</HI> is not in his Life by
<HI>Perault,</HI> but it is true: And he yet has blamed him for his Folly, in
per&s;ecuting <PB N="173" REF="93">the Art of Phy&s;ick, not the Men, in
di|vers of his Plays.</P>
<P><HI>Moliere</HI> &s;ent for Dr. <HI>M&mdash;,</HI> a Phy|&s;itian
in <HI>Paris</HI> of great E&s;teem and Worth, and now in <HI>London,</HI> a
Refuge. Dr. <HI>M&mdash;</HI> &s;ent him word, he would come to him, upon two
Conditions; the one, that he &s;hould An&s;wer him only to &s;uch Que&s;tions
as he &s;hould ask him, and not otherwi&s;e Di&s;cour&s;e him; the other, that
he &s;hould oblige him&s;elf to take the Medecines he &s;hould pre&s;cribe for
him. But <HI>Moliere</HI> finding the Doctor too hard for him, and not ea&s;ily
to be <HI>Dupt,</HI> refu&s;ed them. His Bu&s;ine&s;s, it &s;eems, was to make
a Comical Scene in expo&s;ing one of the Learnede&s;t Men of the
Profe&s;&s;ion, as he had done the Quacks. If this was his Intention, as in all
probability it was, <HI>Moliere</HI> had as much Malice, as Wit; which is only
to be u&s;ed to correct the Vitiou&s;ne&s;s and Folly of Men pretend|ing to
Knowledge, and not the Arts them&s;elves.</P>
<P>This I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, That Ob&s;ceni|ty and Immorality are

</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subsection">
<P>Hitherto I have given a &s;hort Account of what I &s;aw mo&s;tly
in <HI>Paris,</HI> as to the People, abroad and at home; The Coun|try, round
about it, is full of populous and neat Towns, and many Palaces of the King and
Princes of the Blood; which are not to be equalled with any thing we have in
<HI>England.</HI> But I am unwilling to lead you any further, it being much out
of my way and humour to go to Court; but becau&s;e it was my fortune to be at
<HI>Ver&s;ailles, St. Clou, Marli,</HI> and <HI>Meudon,</HI> I will venture to
&s;ay &s;omething of each.</P>
<P>The&s;e 4 Royal Palaces and their Gar|dens po&s;&s;e&s;s a barren
and hilly Country, as big as mo&s;t Counties in <HI>England:</HI> Two of them,
<HI>Meudon</HI> and <HI>St. Cloud,</HI> have the Pro&s;pect of <HI>Paris</HI>
under them; but the former hath it much more open and fully, than the
latter.</P>
<P>This Di&s;trict may be &s;aid to be <HI>Le Ber|ceau des Roys,</HI>
or the Nur&s;ery of Kings; for the chief of the Blood Royal are lodged here,
<HI>viz.</HI> the King, Mon&s;eigneur the Dauphin, and the 3 Grand&s;ons, the
Dukes of <HI>Burgundy, d'Anjou,</HI> and <HI>Berry,</HI> Mon&s;ieur or the
Kings Brother, and his Son the Duke of <HI>Charlres,</HI> and Mademoi|&s;elle 
<PB N="196" REF="105">his Daughter. All the&s;e are, or will be (as it is
ea&s;ie to gue&s;s by the growth and proportions of the younge&s;t) very large
and well &s;haped beautiful People. The other Branch of the Blood Royal, of the
Hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> as the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> the Duke of
<HI>Bourbon,</HI> and the Prince&s;&s;es his Daughters, the Prince of
<HI>Conti,</HI> are all of le&s;s Stature, but very well &s;haped and
hand&s;om.</P>
<P>The Duke <HI>du Maine</HI> and the <HI>Conte de Toulou&s;e</HI> I
did not &s;ee; but the Prince&s;s Dowager of <HI>Conti</HI> often, who is
without di&s;pute one of the mo&s;t graceful and hand&s;ome&s;t Women in
<HI>France,</HI> and me|thinks exceedingly like the King her Fa|ther, as I
remember him in his full beau|ty, when I fir&s;t &s;aw him in the year-65.</P>
<P>The&s;e 4 Palaces are all intirely built and furni&s;ht in this
Kings time, and all the Gardens, and what belongs to them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>St. Clou.</HI></NOTE><HI>St. Clou</HI> is
the neare&s;t <HI>Paris,</HI> and the Ca&s;tle is very magnificent, and mo&s;t
commodious. The Great <HI>Salon</HI> and the <HI>Gallery</HI> are extreamly
well Painted.</P>
<P>The Gardens are a va&s;t Extent, 12 or 15 miles in compa&s;s.</P>
<P>The Natural <HI>Woods</HI> on the South-we&s;t &s;ide the Hou&s;e,
are well Husbanded, and cut into &s;mall and bigger Alleys, to &s;ave 
<PB N="197" REF="105">the Trees; which they have had &s;o great a care of, they
have kept them &s;tanding not only in the Alleys, but in the very <HI>Steps of
Stone,</HI> which are made to de&s;cend into the Alleys.</P>
<P>In the other parts of the Garden the Al|leys are mo&s;tly treble,
and well &s;haded, run out in va&s;t lengths of &s;everal miles, every where
<HI>Ba&s;ins and Jetts d'eau;</HI> but there is a <HI>Ca&s;cade,</HI> which I
&s;aw &s;everal times play, and is &s;aid to be the mo&s;t beautiful and be&s;t
furni&s;ht with Water of any in <HI>France.</HI> In the middle of the large
Ba|&s;in among&s;t the Woods, I &s;aw a <HI>Jet d'eau,</HI> which threw up a
Spout of Water 90 foot high, and did di&s;charge it &s;elf with that force,
that it made a mi&s;t and cool|ne&s;s to the Air a great compa&s;s round about,
and gave now and then cracks like the going off of a Pi&s;tol; &s;uch force the
vent of Wind in the Pipes had.</P>
<P>The Pipes which convey the Water are compo&s;ed of Iron Cylinders
3 foot long, &s;ome 10, &s;ome 20 inches diameter, till they divide; and then
they are of Lead.</P>
<P>I was once kindly invited to <HI>St. Clou</HI> by Madam's
Phy&s;ician, Mon&s;ieur <HI>Arlot,</HI> who &s;ent his Coach for me to
<HI>Paris,</HI> and nobly Treated me: Before Dinner he carried me in his Coach
(for this privi|ledge <PB N="198" REF="106">is granted him) into all parts, and
round the Gardens; which were well furni&s;ht with Alleys and Walks, adorn|ed
with Cypre&s;s, Pines, and Firrs, cut into Pyramids; and Water-Works every
where playing in abundance, particu|larly the <HI>Gerbes d'eau</HI> were very
fine, that is, great and thick, &s;eeming Streams of Water thrown up into the
Air; This is done to husband the Water by a great number of &s;mall Pipes like
a <HI>Sheaf,</HI> to re|pre&s;ent a &s;olid Pillar of Water.</P>
<P><HI>Mon&s;ieur</HI> has added, and taken into this va&s;t Garden,
a new acqui&s;ition of a <HI>Mountainous Plain,</HI> which over-looks all the
Country round; and will, no doubt, when it is modelled by that admirable
Contriver <HI>Mon&s;. le No&s;tre,</HI> make one of the mo&s;t delightful
Places in the World.</P>
<P>From the Balu&s;trade in the Upper Gar|den, the River
<HI>Seine,</HI> and a va&s;t Plain bounded by <HI>Paris,</HI> is to be &s;een,
and makes a mo&s;t delightful Pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>The&s;e va&s;t <HI>riding Gardens</HI> are unknown to us in
<HI>England,</HI> and <HI>&s;e promener a che|val, on en caro&s;&s;e,</HI> is
not <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> We can|not afford to lo&s;e &s;o much Country, as
tho&s;e Gardens take up. I &s;ee in &s;ome of the Quarters not only Partridge
and Hares plentifully, but, which I wonder|ed at, 5 <HI>Biches</HI> or Female
Red-Deer feed|ing.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="106">The <HI>Orangery</HI> belonging to this
Garden is very large and magnificent, paved with Marble, and was filled with
va&s;t Trees in Ca&s;es, not to be brought in or out without proper Engines,
but in it there was nothing but tho&s;e Orange Trees, Oleanders, and Laurus
Tinus's. He goes out of the end of his Appartment, that is, the noble painted
Gallery is conti|nued upon a level with the Orangery, which leads directly into
an a&s;cending Walk of a va&s;t length; and al&s;o fronts or flanks all along
the Parterre or Flower Garden; where they are di&s;po&s;ed of in Summer. At
this Treat I eat of a Pre&s;erve or Wet Sweetmeat, made of Orange Flowers,
incomparable; and the Lady obliged me with the manner of making it.</P>
<P>Though there were high and proper Walls for Fruit in many parts of
the Garden, yet nothing of that nature was to be found, only ordinary and
<HI>in|fructiferous Greens</HI> were fa&s;tned to the Treillage, which are the
Linings of mo&s;t Walls here. In the Garden are many Arbours of Treillage,
Pavillons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of Iron mixt with Wood, painted Green, with Honey
Suckles running up them. The&s;e Gardens have above 150 People always imployed
to keep them in or|der; <PB N="200" REF="107">which &s;tands in 40000 Livres a
year.</P>
<P>Another time I Dined with the Captain of the Ca&s;tle, who
&s;hewed me all the Apartments at lei&s;ure. I eat here of the Red Leg'd
Partridge taken here upon the&s;e Hills; They are much le&s;s here than in
<HI>Languedoc,</HI> but yet far better ta&s;ted, than the Grey Partridges taken
in the &s;ame place. This was the beginning of <HI>April,</HI> and we drank our
Wine in Ice, which I was not aware off, till I found the bad effect of it in my
Throat; and the next day much more; but it went off again without any great
trouble. There is no Animal that abu&s;es it &s;elf in Meat and Drink, as Man
does; we daily drink exce&s;&s;ive hot and exce&s;&s;ive cold; in other
Creatures it's In&s;tinct that guides them, but as for us we neither act by
In&s;tinct, nor Rea&s;on; but betwixt both <HI>loo&s;ely,</HI> and therefore
oftner are catcht, to our own de&s;truction.</P>
<P>At the end of the Apartments of <HI>Mon&s;ieur,</HI> are a fine
Set of Clo&s;ets; The fir&s;t you enter is furni&s;ht with great va|riety of
Rock Cry&s;tals, Cups, Agats up|on &s;mall Stands, and the &s;ides of the Rooms
are lined with large Panes of Looking-gla&s;s from top to the bottom, with
Japan Varni&s;h and Paintings of e|qual <PB N="201" REF="107">breadth
intermixt; which had a marvellous pretty effect. The other Room had in it a
va&s;t quantity of <HI>Bijou,</HI> and many of very great Price; but the
<HI>Siam Pagods,</HI> and other things from thence, were very odd.</P>
<P>There was al&s;o one very &s;mall <HI>Roman Statue</HI> of White
Marble, not 10 inches high, which co&s;t 20000 Crowns; one Leg of it was a
little injured. It &s;eemed a Piece of admirable Workman&s;hip. It was a
<HI>Boy,</HI> who had in the Skirt of his Tunic <HI>a Litter of Puppies,</HI>
and the <HI>Bitch</HI> lying at his feet and looking up.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Meudon.</HI></NOTE>I cannot &s;ay much of
<HI>Meudon,</HI> becau&s;e I was not within the Hou&s;e or Park; it will
require yet &s;ome time to bring it to that perfection which is de&s;igned, for
that Mon&s;eigneur has been but lately po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it; The Road from
<HI>Paris</HI> to it is yet un|paved; but the Situation is admirable, and the
<HI>Splanade</HI> before the Hou&s;e is like a va&s;t Ba&s;tion, and commands
the full view of all the Campagne, and <HI>Paris</HI> under it. The Gardens are
very great, but I only coa&s;ted them, and the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ver&s;ailles.</HI></NOTE>As to the Palace
of <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> (which is yet &s;ome miles further within the
Moun|tainous Country, not unlike <HI>Black-Heath</HI> <PB N="202" REF="108">or
<HI>Tunbridge</HI>) 'tis without di&s;pute the mo&s;t magnificent of any in
<HI>Europe;</HI> Yet what of it was fir&s;t built, and much admired 30 years
ago, is now no longer reli&s;ht: However this King intends to rebuild it, where
it is faulty. 'Tis, as I &s;aid, plac'd in a very ungrateful Soil, without
Earth proper for Herbs, or Water; but he hath brought that to it in abundance,
and made the Ground too to be fruitful.</P>
<P>There are Books writ to de&s;cribe this famous Palace in every
part; to which I refer the Reader. The Way to it is new, and in &s;ome places
the Mountains are cut down 40 foot, &s;o that now you enjoy it a mile in
pro&s;pect before you come to it; it opens and clo&s;es in 3 Courts, the more
remote&s;t narrower and narrower; which is a fault; and is, as I was told,
de&s;igned to be pulled down, and made into one noble large &s;quare Court of
the &s;ame or|der of building, as that magnificent Front is, which looks upon
the Gardens. The Gilded Tiles and Roof have a marvellous effect in pro&s;pect.
The Splanade towards the Gardens and Parterres are the no|ble&s;t things that
can be &s;een, va&s;tly great, with a very large Ba&s;in of Water in the
middle, walled round with white Marble, on which are placed a great number of
incomparable Brazen Va&s;a, and large <PB N="203" REF="108">Bra&s;s Figures
<HI>couchant,</HI> of the be&s;t Ma&s;ters in Sculpture; it were endle&s;s to
tell all the Furniture of the&s;e Gardens of Marble Statues, and Va&s;a of
Bra&s;s and Marble, the multitude of Fountains, and tho&s;e wide Canals like
Seas running in a &s;treight line from the bottom of the Gardens, as far as the
Eye can reach.</P>
<P>In a Word, the&s;e Gardens are a Coun|trey laid out into Alleys
and Walks, Groves of Trees, Canals and Fountains, and every where adorned with
ancient and modern Statues and <HI>Va&s;a</HI> innumer|able.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> the 17th the Waters were order|ed to Play for the
Diver&s;ion of the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> Gentlemen. The Playing of the Spouts of
Water, thrown up into the Air, is here diver&s;ified after a thou&s;and
fa&s;hions. The <HI>Theatre des eaux,</HI> and the <HI>Triumphal Arch</HI> are
the mo&s;t famous Pieces. But in the Groves of the Left Hand, you have
<HI>Ae&s;op's Fables,</HI> in &s;o many Pieces of Water-Works, here and there
in Wind|ing-Alleys. This might have been &s;aid to be done <HI>in &V;&s;um

<P><PB N="204" REF="109">The <HI>Orangery,</HI> or Winter
Con&s;ervato|ry for Tubs of Winter Greens, is what corre&s;ponds to the

under|ground Vaults, like the Naves of &s;o many Churches put together, of
exqui&s;ite Work|man&s;hip in hewn Stone, well lighted and open to the South
Sun. It contains 3000 Ca&s;es of Greens; whereof near 2000 are Orange Trees,
and many hun|dreds of them are as big as generally they naturally grow in the
Earth: Hence among&s;t them are &s;ome, which are &s;aid to be in Ca&s;es from

<P>They did not think fitting to put them out this year till the

my Lord Amba&s;&s;a|dor went to <HI>Marli,</HI> where the Waters played for his

<P>I mu&s;t needs &s;ay it is one of the plea|&s;ante&s;t Places I
ever &s;aw, or, I believe, is in <HI>Europe;</HI> it is &s;eated in the bo&s;om
or upper end of a high Valley, in the mid&s;t of and &s;urrounded with Woody
Hills. The Valley is clo&s;ed at the upper end, and gently de&s;cends forwards
by degrees, and opens wider and wider, and gives you the pro&s;pect of a va&s;t
plain Coun|trey, and the River <HI>Seine</HI> running through it.</P>
<P><HI>Marli</HI> is a &s;quare Hou&s;e rai&s;ed upon Steps, and

up Dome-wi&s;e, in which all the &s;ide Rooms meet; which are all Rooms of
State. Above are 12 Lodgings, with a narrow Gallery leading to them. In the
lower Rooms at <HI>Marli,</HI> particularly in the <HI>Octogon Salan,</HI> are
extraordinary large (6 foot at lea&s;t) Marble, or rather <HI>Agat Tables;</HI>
To the be&s;t of which they may be compared. They are veined like Wood, and of

forgot to ask here whence they had them.</P>
<P>In one of the Ground Rooms was a Semicircular <HI>Gilt Bar</HI> or
Rail, which took off and inclo&s;ed the upper end of the Room: Within the Bar
was di&s;po&s;ed &s;e|veral Rows of Porcellain or fine China on Gilt Shelves.
Here at the Corners, within the Bar, opened two &s;mall Doors, whence the
Amba&s;&s;ador and his Retinue were plentifully &s;erved with Chocolate, Tea,

<P>The two &s;ide Fronts of the Hou&s;e have in pro&s;pect great

<P>On each &s;ide the Valley, clo&s;e under the Woods, run along in a

him&s;elf to &s;ingle me out, and very obligingly embraced me, and &s;a|luted
me with a Ki&s;s, and followed it with very kind and familiar
Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ca&s;cade</HI> coming down from the brow of the Hill, on
that Front of the Hou&s;e which re&s;pects and &s;tands near it, was new and
&s;ingular, and of the Kings own invention, as, indeed, all the Gar|den
be&s;ides. From the Hou&s;e it appeared a <HI>Broad River,</HI> quietly gliding
down the Hill; but when I went near it, I found it compo&s;ed of 52 large
&s;quare and &s;hal|low Ba&s;ins of Water, di&s;po&s;ed at right 
<PB N="208" REF="111">Angles, and not declining, but falling over one into
another.</P>
<P>In the Garden were many Fountains, nobly adorned, and had variety
of Wa|ter Pipes playing up into the Air in them. Here are &s;ome
<HI>Gerbes</HI> of a &s;ingular fa&s;hi|on, with a Circle of a great num|ber of
large Pipes, within at lea&s;t two foot diameter; which made the appea|rance of
a va&s;t Pillar of Water. There was one <HI>Jet d'eau</HI> in the bottom of the
Garden, which we were told threw up Water 120 foot high; for of 50 and more
Fountains, we &s;aw but tho&s;e on the &s;ide Alleys to play; mo&s;t of the
great Ba&s;ins in the middle were mending, and dry. To furni&s;h all this
Water, there is a mo&s;t &s;tupendious <HI>Machine,</HI> which was invented by
2 <HI>Liegois.</HI> This Machine forces the Water up 560 foot, from the River
<HI>Seine,</HI> to the top of the Tower or Aqueduct. It throws up 500 inches of
Water by almo&s;t continued Ructations, or quick Pul&s;es. It is wrought by 14
Wheels of 32 feet diameter each, &s;et in the River, and carried about night
and day by its Stream.</P>
<P>This Invention is the &s;ame with what is practi&s;ed in the deep
Coal-pits about <HI>Leeds</HI> in <HI>Lower-Germany;</HI> &s;o that to &s;ee
the Engines, and a great number of Iron <PB N="209" REF="111">Cylinders or
Water Pipes, lying bare <HI>above ground,</HI> and running up a va&s;t
Mountain, is to imagine a deep Coal-Mine turned wrong&s;ide outward.</P>
<P>The Tree mo&s;t in u&s;e here, was the &s;mall leaved
<HI>Horne-Beam;</HI> which &s;erves for <HI>Arcades, Berceaus;</HI> and al&s;o
<HI>Standards</HI> with Globular Heads: At the foot of which they have planted
little <HI>Sprigs</HI> of the &s;ame of a foot and half high; and al&s;o in
&s;ome places in like manner, whole <HI>areas</HI> full of them; which cut
&s;mooth and level, make the fine&s;t <HI>green Hedges</HI> I ever &s;aw; Some
of the&s;e low Hedges were 12 foot broad, and in a barren and dry Climate
&s;upply very artificially the u&s;e of <HI>Gra&s;s|plots.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis certainly very commendable in the King, who plea&s;es
him&s;elf in Plant|ing and Pruning the Trees with his own Hand, to make u&s;e
of no other Trees, but what the Neighbouring Woods afford; &s;o that 'tis
admirable to &s;ee whole Alleys of <HI>Pole Hedges</HI> of great height, and
long Rows of goodly Standard Globes of 18 months growth only.</P>
<P>If this great King, as he grows older, &s;hould take a fancy to
place him&s;elf in a <HI>warmer Climate,</HI> (and he has a good one of his
own, as any under the Sun, in <HI>Languedoc</HI>) as he does his Winter Greens 
<PB N="210" REF="112">in proper Hou&s;es; (and, me-thinks, this In&s;tance
alone &s;hould be &s;ufficient, to convince him of the nece&s;&s;ity there is
to cheri&s;h decaying Nature, and that a Na|turally warm Air is a better fence,
than Cloaths or Fire) what Wonders would not his Pur&s;e and Pa&s;&s;ion for
Planting do there?</P>
<P>The next Woods in <HI>Languedoc</HI> would afford <HI>Laurel,</HI>
and <HI>Myrtles</HI> for Pole Hedges; <HI>Lenti&s;cus's</HI> and
<HI>Phylarea's</HI> in as great abun|dance, as Hazel or Thorn with us. Al&s;o
<HI>Ja&s;mins</HI> for Arbors and <HI>Treillage; Ci&s;tus's</HI> and
<HI>Ro&s;mary,</HI> and a hundred other &s;weet &s;melling Woody Shrubs grow
every where in the Fields, to furni&s;h the <HI>Pots</HI> and
<HI>Va&s;a.</HI></P>
<P>There the tall <HI>Cypres's</HI> grow of them|&s;elves, to 60 and
100 foot high, like &s;o many Towers; and al&s;o <HI>Ton&s;il</HI> at
plea|&s;ure, for the mo&s;t beautiful Pole Hedges imaginable. The very Fields
are mo&s;t Excellent, and well furni&s;ht Parterrs of Flowers, and are
Naturally Pottageries, or Kitchin Gardens. The Vineyards are very Orchards; and
all the mo&s;t tender Fruits with us are there <HI>Standards;</HI> as Figs, and
Grapes of all &s;orts, Apricocks, Peaches, Nectorins, Jujubs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
The de|licious and large Cherries; and, what|ever has been &s;aid to the
contrary, Pipins <PB N="211" REF="112">and Pears there are in far greater
per|fection, than with us, or in any parts of <HI>France</HI> el&s;e, be&s;ides
that happy Climate.</P>
<P>What was it for &s;o great a King to make a Walk from
<HI>Marli</HI> to <HI>Montpelier,</HI> or (if I might choo&s;e) to
<HI>Pe&s;cenas,</HI> &s;eated in the bo&s;om of a well Watered Valley,
inclo&s;ed with <HI>perfumed Hills.</HI> 'Tis not half &s;o far as betwixt
<HI>Lahor</HI> and <HI>Agria,</HI> two Seats the <HI>Mogul</HI> has thus
joined. This would Eterni&s;e his Name, above any Palace he has yet built, and
bring to him&s;elf much Health in his old Age. The Gardens of the
<HI>He&s;perides,</HI> and the <HI>Labyrinths of Cande,</HI> &s;o famous in
Hi&s;tory, would be nothing to &s;uch wonderful Performances, as his Abilities
and Happy Genius is capable of. For be&s;ides the Natural Product of the
Countrey, the Climate al&s;o is capable of producing, and nouri&s;hing with
&s;mall Art and Expence, what ever Plants both the <HI>Indies</HI> can af|ford.
Whereas, at this end of the World, we drudge in vain; and force a Plea&s;ure
which is dead, and gone before we can well enjoy it: We have indeed a kind of
&s;hew of the Summer Delights, but all on a &s;uddain we drop into a long and
tedious Winter again. But we love the Places we are u&s;ed to, or born in. Man,
to &s;ay the truth, is a very Animal, <PB N="212" REF="113">as any Quadrupede
of them all; and mo&s;t of his Actions are re&s;olvable into In&s;tinct,
notwith&s;tanding the Principles which Cu&s;tom and Education have
&s;uper|induced.</P>
<P>The plea&s;ure of &s;eeing is &s;carce to be tired; but yet after
2 or 3 hours Walk in &s;o fine and great a Garden, I was forc't to make a halt
behind the Com|pany, and glad to retire to the gilt <HI>Bu|reau</HI> in the
Palace again, to refre&s;h my &s;elf; where I found &s;ome of the Kings
Officers waiting, and &s;ome other Gentle|men of the Hou&s;hold, who had made
&s;e|veral Campagnes in <HI>Flanders.</HI> I had now more a mind to a Gla&s;s
of cool <HI>Burgun|dy,</HI> than the in&s;ignificant <HI>Indian</HI> Liquors;
which though I knew was again&s;t the &s;anctity of the place, yet nothing was
denied me a Stranger. Here being alone, we fell into Di&s;cour&s;e of the
<HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and of their King. They willingly allowed the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to be truly Brave; and now in Peace they found al&s;o, that
they were as Civil, and well Bred, as Brave; That no Nation had given the King
and his Court that &s;atisfaction, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had done; being
curious and inqui&s;itive after all good things; They did &s;ee a great
difference betwixt them and other Nations; They did not &s;tare, and
care|les&s;ly <PB N="213" REF="113">run about, or hold up their Heads, and
de&s;pi&s;e what they &s;aw; but had a true reli&s;h of every good thing, and
made a good Judgment of what was Commendable; and therefore the King took
plea&s;ure to have them &s;hewed e|very thing. This Di&s;cour&s;e of the
<HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> they concluded with a great Enco|mium of K.
<HI>William.</HI></P>
<P>As for their own King they were much in the Prai&s;e of him, as
one may ea&s;ily imagine: That his Retirement hither was mo&s;tly for his
Health; That he left <HI>Ver&s;ailles</HI> every <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> night, and
came hither with a &s;elect Company of Lords and Ladies; That he returned not
till <HI>Saturday</HI> night, and &s;ometimes inter|mitted 10 or 14 days; &s;o
that he &s;pent half of his time here in Repo&s;e; That he was the mo&s;t
affable Prince in the World, and never out of Humour, of a plea&s;ant and open
Conver&s;ation where it plea&s;ed him; ea&s;ie of acce&s;s, and never &s;ent
any one away di&s;contented; The mo&s;t Bountiful Ma&s;ter in the World, of
which there were Ten thou&s;and In&s;tances; nothing of Merit in any Kind, but
he mo&s;t readily and chearfully Rewarded, ever, of late years at lea&s;t,
preferring the Virtuous; &s;o on the other hand, he never &s;pared the
Rebellious and Ob&s;tinate; That the <PB N="214" REF="114">Government of his
People could not be carried on with le&s;s &s;everity and &s;trict|ne&s;s; nor
the Taxes which was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport it, rai&s;ed; That he delighted
not in Blood or Per&s;ecution; but that the Art of Government had different
Rules, according to the Climate and Nature of the People, where and upon whom
it was to be put in practice. His great <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> appeared in nothing
more, than in pre|&s;erving him&s;elf amid&s;t his Troops, his Converts, his
Court and numerous Fa|mily, all in a manner fit for the Throne. The greatne&s;s
of his Mind, and Magni|ficence, in his Buildings. This was the Sum of the
Di&s;cour&s;e the&s;e Gentlemen were plea&s;ed to entertain me with.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Pipi|nerie.</HI></NOTE>At my return to
<HI>Paris</HI> I was to &s;ee the <HI>Pipinerie,</HI> or <HI>Royal Nur&s;ery of
Plants,</HI> in the <HI>Fauxbourgh</HI> of <HI>St. Honorie;</HI> where I met
the Ma&s;ter or Controuler of it, Mon|&s;ieur <HI>Morley,</HI> one of the
U&s;hers of the Bed-Chamber to the King.</P>
<P>He, like the re&s;t of the <HI>French</HI> Nation, was Civil to
me; and &s;hewed me a Writ|ten Almanack of Flowring Plants for the whole year,
which he &s;aid was an Ori|ginal; it might, indeed, be &s;o in <HI>French,</HI>
but we have had Almanacks for Fruit and Flowers, for every month in the 
<PB N="215" REF="114">year, Printed divers times, for above this 30 years,
thanks to Mr. <HI>Evelyn.</HI></P>
<P>This Ground inclo&s;ed with high Walls is va&s;tly big, as it
ought to be, to &s;up|ply the Kings Gardens; Here are &s;everal Acres of young
Pines, Cypre&s;&s;es, Vues, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> al&s;o va&s;t Beds of Stock
July-Flowers, of all &s;orts of Bulbes, as Tulips, Dafi|dills, Crocus's,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> and therefore I could ea&s;ily believe him, when he told me,
he had &s;ent from hence to <HI>Marli</HI> alone, in 4 years time, 18 millions
of Tulips, and other Bulbous Flowers; for which he offered to &s;hew me his
Memoires.</P>
<P>He further told me, that the furni&s;hing the <HI>Trianon,</HI> (a
peculiar Hou&s;e of Plea|&s;ure, with its Parterres at the end of the Gardens
at <HI>Ver&s;ailles</HI>) with Flower Pots in &s;ea&s;on, every 14 days in the
Summer, took up no le&s;s than 92000 Pots from hence.</P>
<P>Al&s;o from hence he could Plant and furni&s;h in 14 days time,
any new Gar|den the King &s;hould cau&s;e to be made.</P>
<P>Here be&s;ides the Plants common to us and them, I &s;aw a
multitude of Pots well conditioned of <HI>Staechas citrina folio
latiu&s;|culo.</HI></P>
<P>Al&s;o a &s;ort of <HI>Cotila,</HI> which bore large Sun Flowers
or Marigolds, propagated by Slips, called by him <HI>Amaroutre.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="115">In this Ground are &s;everal Hou&s;es to
lodge the tender Winter Greens; a|mong&s;t the re&s;t there is one very large,
which I may call the <HI>Infirmery of &s;ick Orange Trees;</HI> which coming
from <HI>Genoa</HI> by Sea, are here depo&s;ited in a pe|culiar Green Hou&s;e;
and there were in it, and then actually carrying out into the Air, (it was the
22th of <HI>May</HI> our Style) 300 Trees in Ca&s;es as thick as a Man's Thigh;
but after 10, and &s;ome after 17 years cheri&s;hing, had not yet got Heads
decent enough to be removed, and to appear at Court, they being often forc't to
lop both Tops and Root, that they might recover them.</P>
<P>After all, it mu&s;t be &s;aid, that this Magnificence, and the
number of the&s;e Palaces and Gardens, are the be&s;t and mo&s;t commendable
effect of <HI>Arbitrary Go|vernment.</HI> If the&s;e Expences were not in time
of Peace, what would be this Kings Riches, and the extream Poverty of the
People? For it is &s;aid, that every 3 years, &s;ome &s;ay much oftner, he has
all the Wealth of the Nation in his Coffers; &s;o that there is a nece&s;&s;ity
he &s;hould have as extravagant and incredible ways of expending it, that it
may have its due circulation among&s;t the People.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="115">But when this va&s;t Wealth and Power is
turned to the Di&s;turbance and De&s;tru|ction of Mankind, it is terrible; and
yet it hath its u&s;e too: We and all <HI>Europe</HI> have been taught, by the
Indu&s;try of this great King, mighty Improvements in War; &s;o that
<HI>Europe</HI> has been the&s;e 12 years an Over-match for the <HI>Turk;</HI>
and we for <HI>France</HI> by the continuation of the War. The 40 Millions
<HI>Sterling</HI> which the late War hath, and will co&s;t <HI>England,</HI>
before all is paid, was well be|&s;towed, if it had been for no other end, than
to teach us the full u&s;e and practice of War; and in that Point to equal us
with our Neighbours.</P>
<P>It was ob&s;erved by <HI>Polybius</HI> of the <HI>Ro|mans,</HI>
that wherever they met with an Enemy, that had better Weapons than
them&s;elves, they changed with them; This Docility gained them the Empire of
the World. On the contrary, tho&s;e late Ea&s;tern Tyrants have de&s;pi&s;ed
Learning, and con&s;equently mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the more refined Valour of
<HI>Europe.</HI> I &s;ay, the Effects of Arbitrary Govern|ment, both in War and
Peace, are Stu|pendious.</P>
<P>The <HI>Roman Emperours,</HI> becau&s;e ab&s;o|lute Lords of the
People; far out-did the Commonwealth in Magnificent Build|ings, 
<PB N="218" REF="116">both Publick and Private. <HI>Au|gu&s;tus</HI> left
<HI>Rome</HI> a Marble City, which he found of Brick only. <HI>Nero</HI> burnt
it and rebuilt it, and a <HI>Golden Palace</HI> for him&s;elf, like a City.
<HI>Ve&s;patian</HI> and <HI>Titus</HI> built Amphitheaters and Baths far
&s;urpa&s;&s;ing any Buildings now upon the face of the Earth; in one of which
120000 Per&s;ons might &s;ee and hear, and be &s;eated with more convenience,
than upon our Stages. <HI>Adrian</HI> vi&s;ited mo&s;t parts of the World, on
purpo&s;e to build Cities. <HI>Trajan</HI> had his Name on every Wall, which he
either re&s;tored, or built. His Pillar and Bridge over the <HI>Danube</HI> are
Stupendious Monu|ments of his Expences.</P>
<P>The <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Kings built them Monu|ments, wherein they
&s;laved their whole Nation, and which are the Wonders of the World to this
day, the <HI>Obelisks</HI> I mean, and <HI>Pyramids.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>A&s;iatick Emperours</HI> of <HI>China</HI> and
<HI>Japan</HI> have outdone the <HI>Europeans</HI> in this kind of immen&s;e
Buildings, as the Wall in <HI>China,</HI> the Cut Rivers and Sluces and Bridges
there. In <HI>Japan</HI> the Buildings are no le&s;s incredibly great.</P>
<P>Of this Ab&s;olute Dominion we have Examples even in tho&s;e two
<HI>American</HI> Empires, of <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru.</HI> In this
la&s;t, meer Nature forc't Impo&s;&s;ibilities <PB N="219" REF="116">without
Art, Tools, or Science. The <HI>Cu&s;co</HI> Fortre&s;s was a Ma&s;ter-piece,
where Stones were laid upon Stones, which no Engine of ours could carry, or
rai&s;e up; or Tools better poli&s;h, and fit together; where a Country near as
big as all <HI>Eu|rope,</HI> was turned into a Garden, and cul|tivated better
than <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> and Water-Works brought to Play and over&s;pread
&s;ome thou&s;ands of miles, where it never Rains. This was the only Arbitrary
Go|vernment well applied to the good of Mankind, I ever met with in Hi&s;tory;
where Roads and Store-hou&s;es of Food and Raiment were the Guides, and
num|bred the miles for the Travellers, and the whole Empire turned into an
u&s;eful and intelligible Map.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Turks, Per&s;ians,</HI> and <HI>Mogul,</HI> the
whole Empire is intended &s;olely for the Plea&s;ure of one Man; and here even
Tyranny it &s;elf is foully abu&s;ed.</P>
<P>Yet I &s;hould be loth to &s;ee them in any kind exemplified in
<HI>England.</HI> In our happy I&s;land we &s;ee &s;uch Palaces and Gardens, as
are for the Health and Ea&s;e of Man only; and what they want in Magnificence,
they have in Neatne&s;s. There is not &s;uch a thing as a <HI>Gravel Walk</HI>
in or about <HI>Paris,</HI> nor a <HI>Rowler</HI> of any &s;ort; when it Rains
the Tuilleries <PB N="220" REF="117">are &s;hut up, and one walks in Dirt
&s;ome days after. The Gra&s;s Plots, or, as they call them <HI>Bowling
Greens,</HI> are as ill kept, they clip them and beat them with flat Beaters as
they do their Walks. This puts me in mind of what I &s;aw in the Garden of the
<HI>Prince of Conde</HI> in <HI>Paris;</HI> where there was a Gra&s;&s;y Circle
of about 4 foot wide, round one of the Fountains in the middle of the Garden;
to keep this down, and make it of a finer Turf, the Gardner had Teathered two
<HI>Black Lambs,</HI> and two <HI>White Kids,</HI> at equal di&s;tances, which
fed upon it. What ever the effect was, I thought it lookt pretty enough; and
the little <HI>Animals</HI> were as Ornamen|tal, as the Gra&s;s.</P>
<P>All the Paintings and Prints made of late years of the King make
him look very old; which in my mind is not &s;o; for he is plump in the Face,
and is well coloured, and &s;eems healthy, and eats and drinks heartily, which
I &s;aw him do; This is certainly an injury to him, and po&s;&s;ibly in
complai&s;ance to the Dauphin, or wor&s;e. This is the meane&s;t Compliment I
have known the French guilty of to|wards their Prince; for there are every
where Expre&s;&s;ions of an other nature all over <HI>Paris.</HI> See <HI>The
De&s;cription of Paris,</HI> where they are collected and at large. 
<PB N="221" REF="117">The <HI>Romans</HI> under <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> (the
fir&s;t Ab|&s;olute Ma&s;ter of that People, as this King is of the
<HI>French</HI>) had upon this Subject from the People a much finer thought,
and wi&s;h, <HI>De no&s;tris annis tibi Jupiter au|geat annos.</HI></P>
<P>However it be, the King &s;eems not to like <HI>Ver&s;ailles</HI>
&s;o well as he did; and has an Opinion, that the Air is not &s;o good, as
el&s;ewhere; he leaves it (as I &s;aid) every week on <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> night,
and goes mo&s;tly to <HI>Marli,</HI> or <HI>Meudon,</HI> and &s;ome|times to
the <HI>Trianon,</HI> which is but at the end of the Gardens, and returns not
to <HI>Ver&s;ailles</HI> till <HI>Saturday</HI> night: Be&s;ides his
extraordinary removes to <HI>Fontainbleau.</HI> I wonder no body puts him in
mind of that Paradi&s;e of <HI>France, Languedoc,</HI> where he may be with
ea&s;e in 4 days, at the Rate that Kings u&s;e to Travel. I had this
Di&s;cour&s;e at Table with one of the In|troducteurs to the Amba&s;&s;adour at
<HI>Ver|&s;ailles;</HI> but he could not bear it, it being again&s;t the
Intere&s;t of all &s;ettled Courts to remove, though it were never &s;o good
for their Princes Health. I remember but of one In&s;tance in Hi&s;tory, and
that was <HI>Aurenzebe</HI> the Great <HI>Mogul,</HI> who in his middle Age
fell de&s;perately &s;ick, and long langui&s;ht at <HI>Labor;</HI> but took
Advice of &s;ome body about him, and went in <PB N="222" REF="118">his own
Kingdom a progre&s;s of 1000 miles to <HI>Ca&s;imire,</HI> a very mild and
tem|perate Climate, where he recovered, and lived to almo&s;t a 100 years
old.</P>
<P>The King now &s;eldom or never Plays, but contents him&s;elf
&s;ometimes with look|ing on; but he hath formerly been en|gaged, and has
lo&s;t great Sums. Mon|&s;ieur <HI>S.</HI> Rookt him of near a Million of
Livers at Ba&s;&s;et, by putting fal&s;e Cards upon him; but was impri&s;oned
and ba|ni&s;ht for it &s;ome years.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="subsection">
<P>Before I give over the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Gar|dens and Countrey, I
will add &s;ome Re|marks, which &s;eemed particular and new to me.</P>
<P>In the Kitchin Gardens at and near <HI>Paris,</HI> are a great
number of <HI>Apricock Standards;</HI> but kept low; very full of Blo&s;&s;oms,
and good Bearers.</P>
<P>They make a Con&s;erve of the Fruit; which I like above any of
their Wet Sweetmeats; it was made by cutting them into thin &s;lices, and
throwing a|way the Stone; which our People &s;pare &s;ometimes, and leave in
the Fle&s;h intire, and &s;poils the Sweetmeat, and &s;ets it a fretting.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="118">They imploy the Stones in Brandy, and
di&s;til them in Spirits.</P>
<P>In the beginning of <HI>April</HI> we had &s;tore of Sparagra&s;s,
but they were often &s;o bitter, to me at lea&s;t, that there was little
plea&s;ure in eating them. 'Tis certain they were much wor&s;e, than ours in
<HI>England</HI> in that particular. Which puts me in mind of the <HI>Wild
Sparagra&s;s,</HI> which grows plentifully with us on the <HI>Sea Coa&s;t</HI>
in <HI>Lincoln&s;hire.</HI> This is very fair to the Eye; yet no culture of our
Gardens, by often tran&s;planting, could make it eat|able. I fancy the

to Mr. <HI>London,</HI> our Kings Gardner, for my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador. This

u&s;ually ripe at <HI>St. Johns|ma&s;s</HI> in <HI>July</HI> at

<P><PB N="224" REF="119">There are al&s;o in this Town <HI>Praecox

our Syle, when the&s;e Trees were &s;carce green.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 25, when I took my Leave of Mon&s;ieur
<HI>Valliant,</HI> I found him in his Flower Garden; he &s;hewed me a Parcel 
<PB N="225" REF="119">of <HI>Ranunculus</HI>'s, in full Flower, which he had
received but two years before from <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> They were very
beautiful and rare, at lea&s;t &s;uch as I had never &s;een; as pure White,
White and Green, White and Strip't with Carnation, Pure Carnation or
Ro&s;e-colour, Strip't Carna|tion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Of the&s;e he had &s;old &s;ome a Pi&s;tol a Root, and hoped in a
year or two to be more plentifully &s;tock't with them, that he might afford
them cheaper. I did &s;ee afterwards a few of them in the Royal
<HI>Pipinerie,</HI> and al&s;o in the Seed&s;man's Gar|den, Mon&s;ieur <HI>le
Febre;</HI> but both came from him.</P>
<P>I al&s;o took notice of his Iron Cradles or Hoops over his Beds,
which were re|movable, and to be made higher and lower, according to the height
and na|ture of the Floors they were de&s;igned to cover. This, me-thoughts, was
far be|yond all the Inventions of Wooden Co|vers, and might with Sail-Cloths
and Mats well &s;erve for a &s;ort of portable Green Hou&s;e, to the le&s;s
tender Plants.</P>
<P>I &s;aw <HI>Le Febre</HI>'s Flower Garden <HI>May</HI> 9. The
Tulips were in their prime; indeed, he had a very large and plentiful
Col|lection. The Panache&eacute; or Strip't Tulips were many, and of great
variety. He <PB N="226" REF="120">ob&s;erved to me, that from his large and
numerous Beds of <HI>&s;elf-flower'd</HI> Tulips, that is, of one colour, as
Red, Yellow, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they expected yearly &s;ome Stript ones, which
<HI>if perfect,</HI> that is, &s;trip't in all the &s;ix Leaves, would but
doubtfully continue, and perhaps return to their former &s;tate the next year;
but if they <HI>laboured,</HI> or did not fini&s;h the &s;tripings of all the
&s;ix Leaves the fir&s;t year, there were better hopes of their continuing in
that &s;tate.</P>
<P>Though I had no mind to de&s;cend into the <HI>Stone Pits,</HI>
which are like our Mines, Well-fa&s;hion, and the Stones wound up with great
Wheels, to husband the Soil over them: Yet I went to <HI>Vanre,</HI> 3 miles
from the Town, which is a ridge of Hills that runs along to the
<HI>Ob&s;ervatoire.</HI> Here the Quarries are open on the &s;ide of the Hill,
as with us. In tho&s;e I ob&s;erved 2 or 3 layers of Stone, 2 or 3 foot thick,
mo&s;tly made up of Shells, or <HI>Stones in the fa&s;hion of Shells.</HI>
Among&s;t the&s;e Shell-&s;tones the mo&s;t remarkable for bigne&s;s was a
certain &s;mooth and long <HI>Buccinum,</HI> tapering with very many &s;pires.
I mea&s;ured one who&s;e fir&s;t &s;pire was 8 inches diameter, the full length
I could not &s;o well come at; yet holding proportion with tho&s;e of the kind
which lay flat, and which we could &s;ee in their full length, it mu&s;t have
been <PB N="227" REF="120">a foot long at lea&s;t. There is no
<HI>Bucci|num</HI> in any of our Seas a quarter &s;o big. Here are many of this
Species. Al&s;o other large Turbinated Stones, which come near &s;ome of the
<HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Kinds of <HI>Mu|&s;ic Shells,</HI> of which
<HI>Genus</HI> yet there are none in the <HI>European</HI> Seas.</P>
<P>The&s;e Layers of Stone mixt with Shell-figured bodies, are at
certain di&s;tances in the Rock, and other Rocks void of Shells
interpo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Fanciful Men may think what they plea&s;e of this matter; &s;ure I
am, until the Hi&s;tory of Nature, and more parti|cularly that of Minerals and
Fo&s;&s;ils is better lookt into, and more accurately di&s;tingui&s;ht, all
Rea&s;oning is in vain. It is to be ob&s;erved, where Men are mo&s;t in the
dark, there Impudence reigns mo&s;t, as upon this Subject: They are not
con|tent fairly to di&s;&s;ent, but to in&s;ult every body el&s;e. In like
manner upon the Sub|ject of Mineral Waters; How many <HI>Scriblers</HI> have
there been, without any knowledge of Fo&s;&s;ils?</P>
<P>I know not whether it be worth the not|ing, but it &s;hews the
Humour of the <HI>French,</HI> that I &s;aw in &s;ome Country Towns near
<HI>Paris,</HI> the Church Wall near the top, had a two foot broad Mourning
Li&s;t, which compa&s;&s;ed the whole Church like a <PB N="228" REF="121">Girdle, and on this was at certain di|&s;tances, painted the Arms of
the Lord of the Mannor, who was dead.</P>

<P>I &s;hall conclude, what I have to &s;ay further, with the Air of
<HI>Paris,</HI> and the State of Health and Phy&s;ic there.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Air.</NOTE>The <HI>Air</HI> of <HI>Paris</HI> is
drier than that of <HI>England,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the greate&s;t part of
the City is placed in a dirty miry Level; The Muddy Banks of the River

&s;ignifie <HI>Black Dirt.</HI> We have an undoubted Experi|ment of the
different Temper of the Air in our <HI>Philo&s;ophic Tran&s;actions;</HI> where
it is demon&s;trated, that there falls twice as much Rain in <HI>England,</HI>
as at <HI>Paris;</HI> Re|gi&s;ters of both having carefully been kept, for &s;o
many years, both here and in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>From this quantity of Rain with us, our Fields are much greener; and
it was a plea&s;ing &s;urpri&s;e to me at my return, &s;ailing up the River of
<HI>Thames,</HI> to &s;ee our <PB N="229" REF="121">green Fields and Pa&s;tures
on every &s;ide; but we pay dearly for it, in Agues and Coughs, and Rheumatick
Di&s;tempers.</P>
<P>The Winter was very rude and fierce, as was ever known in the Memory
of Man; The cold Winds very piercing; and the Common People walk the Streets
all in Mouffes, and Multitudes had little <HI>Bra&s;s Kettles</HI> of Smallcoal
kindled, hang|ing on their Arms; and yet you &s;hould &s;carce hear any one
Cough.</P>
<P>I never &s;aw a Mi&s;t at <HI>Paris</HI> in the 6 months I &s;taid
there, but one; though a very broad River runs through the middle of the City,
nor any very &s;trong Winds; but this may be accidental, and the Tem|per of
&s;ome one year by chance.</P>
<P>We were very &s;en&s;ible by the 20th of <HI>February</HI> our
Style, though the Nights were cold, and the White Fro&s;ts great in the
Mornings, that the Sun at Noon had a much &s;tronger force and heat, than with
us, at that time of the year.</P>
<P>Another Argument, of the Dryne&s;s of the Air at <HI>Paris,</HI> we
had from the alterati|on of Health; &s;uch as were thick Breath|ed, and Cought
and Spit much, &s;oon re|covered; and the in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration of the
Skin was &s;o clear and free, that the Kidneys had little to do; &s;o that it
was ob&s;erved by mo&s;t, that though we <PB N="230" REF="122">drank pretty
freely of the thin Wines of <HI>Champagne</HI> and <HI>Burgundy,</HI> yet they
never broke our &s;leep to get &s;hut of them; and that very little pa&s;&s;ed
that way in the morning.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, a &s;ign of the Drine&s;s and great goodne&s;s of the Air
of <HI>Paris</HI> is, the va&s;t number of Iron Bars all over the City; which
yet are mo&s;tly intire, and the lea&s;t decayed with Ru&s;t, I ever &s;aw in
any place; whereas ours in <HI>London</HI> are all in a few years all over
ru&s;ty, and mi&s;erably eaten.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Water.</NOTE>We were &s;ufficiently alarmed at
our fir&s;t coming to <HI>Paris,</HI> with the unwhole|&s;omene&s;s of the
<HI>River Water,</HI> and cautioned again&s;t drinking it; and yet it was
al|mo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to avoid the bad effects of it, for within the month
two thirds of the Family fell into Fluxes, &s;ome into Dy&s;enteries, and
&s;ome very ill of it. The <HI>French</HI> that come out of other re|mote
Countreys &s;uffer as well as the Stran|gers. We were told boiling it was a
good Remedy to prevent its Griping Qua|lity; but that is a meer Notion, for we

the poorer &s;ort of People, through ill Diet, this Wa|ter, and Herbs, are very
&s;ubject to it; This Root is &s;aid to cure it with as much certainty, and as
readily, as the Je&s;uits Powder an Ague; Of this mo&s;t of the Phy&s;icians
and Apothecaries agreed. They give it in Powder from 10 grains to 40, which is
the large&s;t Do&s;e. It mo&s;t commonly Vomits, and &s;ometimes Purges, but
both gently. 'Tis &s;old here from 20 to 50 Crowns a Pound. They divide it into
4 &s;orts, according to its goodne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="123"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Stone.</NOTE>Another popular Di&s;ea&s;e here
is the <HI>Stone;</HI> and there are Men well practi&s;ed in the Cutting for
it. There are al&s;o two Ho&s;pitals, where great numbers are cut yearly, as
<HI>La Charite,</HI> and <HI>Ho&s;tel-Dieu,</HI> in both of the&s;e there are
Wired Che&s;ts full of Stones cut from Human Bodies; and in the Che&s;t of
<HI>La Charite</HI> is one, which exceeds all belief; it was cut from a Monk,
who died in the very Operation; it is as big as a Childs Head. It is but the
Mo|del or Patern of the Stone which is kept in the Che&s;t; which has this
In&s;cription on it.

<P>But that which I &s;hall here mo&s;t in&s;i&s;t upon is the <HI>new
way,</HI> practi&s;ed by <HI>Pere Jaques,</HI> a Monk. About the 20th of
<HI>April</HI> he cut in the <HI>Ho&s;tel-Dieu</HI> 10 in le&s;s than an hours
time: The 3d day after, all were hearty and without pain but one.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="123">He cuts both by the grand and little Appareil;
in both he boldly thru&s;ts in a broad Lancet or Stilleto into the middle of
the Mu&s;cle of the Thigh near the <HI>Anus,</HI> till he joins the Catheter or
Staff, or the Stone betwixt his Fingers; then he wi|dens the inci&s;ion of the
Blader in pro|portion to the Stone with a Silver <HI>Oval Hoop;</HI> if that
will not do, he thru&s;ts in his 4 Fingers, and tears it wider; then with the
<HI>Ducks Bill</HI> he draws it out.</P>
<P>I &s;ee him cut a &s;econd time in the <HI>Ho|&s;tel-Dieu;</HI> and
he performed it upon 9 Per&s;ons in 3 quarters of an hour, very dexterou&s;ly.
He &s;eemed to venture at all; and put me into &s;ome di&s;order with the
cruelty of the Operation; and a &s;touter <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> than my &s;elf.
How|ever I vi&s;ited them all in their Beds, and found them more amazed, than
in pain.</P>
<P><HI>Pere Jaques</HI> cut al&s;o his way in the other Ho&s;pital
<HI>La Charite,</HI> much about the &s;ame time, 11 at twice. Here Mon&s;ieur
<HI>Mar|&s;hal,</HI> the be&s;t of the Surgeons for this Operation now in
<HI>Paris,</HI> harangu'd again&s;t him before the Governors, who coldly
an&s;wered, they would be determined by the Event, which way was be&s;t.</P>

<P>Of tho&s;e cut in <HI>La Charite</HI> one died; and being
di&s;&s;ected, it was found he had his Bladder pierced in 4 or 5 places; al&s;o
the <HI>Mu&s;eulus P&s;ous</HI> &s;adly mangled; al&s;o the left
<HI>Ve&s;iculae Seminales</HI> cut.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this, if this Method was well executed by a
Skilful Hand, it might be of good u&s;e to Mankind.</P>
<P>This way of Cutting for the Stone, puts me in mind of what I
formerly writ and publi&s;ht in the <HI>Phil. Tran&s;actions,</HI> about
Cutting above the <HI>Os Pubis,</HI> in the Fund of the Bladder.</P>
<P>Al&s;o of that Experiment of Cutting for the Stone of an Alderman of

intruding of Quacks, Women, and Monks. Mon&s;ieur <HI>d'Achin,</HI> the late
chief Phy&s;ician, has been ill thought on for taking Money, and gi|ving
protection to the&s;e &s;ort of Cattle; but the chief Phy&s;ician now,
Mon&s;ieur <HI>Fagon,</HI> is a Man of great Honour and Learning, and very
de&s;irous to promote the Art.</P>
<P>It is here as with us, &s;ome practi&s;e out of meer vanity, others
to make a Penny any way to get Bread. The cau&s;e of all <PB N="240" REF="127">this is, I think, the great Confidence People have of their own
Skill, an ar|rogance without thinking. To pa&s;s a Judgment upon Cures, and the
good and evil practice of Phy&s;ick, without doubt is one of the nice&s;t
things, even to Men of the Faculty; but a Jury, that is, the very ordinary Men
in <HI>England,</HI> are &s;uffered now to undertake the Que&s;tion; when I may
truly &s;ay, that I have ever found, no di&s;paragement to them, the mo&s;t
Learned Men of the Nation, the mo&s;t mi&s;taken in the&s;e Matters; and can it
be otherwi&s;e in &s;o Conjectural an Art, when we our &s;elves &s;carce know,
when we have done ill or well.</P>
<P>Another cau&s;e of the low E&s;teem of Phy&s;ick here, are the
&s;orry Fees that are given to Phy&s;icians; which makes that Science not worth
the Application and Study. The King indeed is very liberal, as in all things
el&s;e, in his Pen&s;ions to his chief Phy&s;ician, and gives his Chil|dren
good Preferments.</P>
<P>Al&s;o Mr. <HI>Burdelot,</HI> who is al&s;o well Pen&s;ioned, and
lodged at <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> Phy|&s;ician to the Dutche&s;s of
<HI>Burgundy,</HI> a Learned Man; he is perfectly well Skill'd in the Hi&s;tory
of Phy&s;ick; and we may &s;hortly (as he told me) expect from him, another
Supplement to <HI>Vauder Linden,</HI> of <PB N="241" REF="127">many thou&s;and
Volumes, which have e&s;caped that Catalogue, and are not ac|counted for.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur, and the Dauphin, and all the Princes of the Blood, have
their Do|me&s;tick Phy&s;icians; &s;ome of whom I knew, as Mon&s;ieur
<HI>Arlot,</HI> Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mi|not,</HI> to the Prince of <HI>Conty,</HI> of
my ac|quaintance formerly at <HI>Montpelier.</HI> The Two <HI>Morins</HI> very
Learned Men; al&s;o Mon&s;ieur <HI>Grimodel, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Others have the practice of Nunneries and Convents, which gives them
Bread; others have Pari&s;hes; and &s;ome &s;uch Shifts they make; but all is
wrong with them, and very little incouragement given to the Faculty.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 14. the <HI>Prince of Conty</HI> &s;ent his Gentleman
and Coach at mid-night to fetch me to his Son, and to bring with me the late
King <HI>Charles's Drops</HI> to give him. This was a very ha&s;ty call. I told
the Me&s;&s;enger, I was the Prince's very humble Servant; but for any Drops or
other Medicines I had brought nothing at all with me, and had u&s;ed only
&s;uch as I found in their Shops, for all the oc|ca&s;ions I had had to u&s;e
any. I de&s;ired he would tell him, that I was ready to Con&s;ult with his
Phy&s;icians upon his Sons Sickne&s;s, if he plea&s;ed to command me, 
<PB N="242" REF="128">but for coming upon any other Account I de&s;ired to be
excu&s;ed; but I heard no more of the Matter, and the young Prince died. By
this it is evident, there is as fal&s;e a Notion of Phy&s;ick in this Coun|try,
as with us; and that it is here al&s;o thought a Knack, more than a Science or
Method; and little Chimical Toys, the Bijous of Quacks, are mightily in
reque&s;t. This Here&s;ie hath po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t think|ing, as well
as the ignorant part of Man|kind; and for this we are beholden to the late vain
Expo&s;itors of Nature, who have mightily inveighed again&s;t and un|dervalued
the ancient <HI>Greek</HI> Phy&s;icians, in who&s;e Works only this Art is to
be learnt, unle&s;s &s;ingle Per&s;ons could live over as many Ages, as tho&s;e
Wi&s;e Men did.</P>
<P>Men are apt to pre&s;cribe to their Phy|&s;ician, before he can
po&s;&s;ibly tell, what he &s;hall in his Judgment think fitting to give; 'tis
well if this was in Negatives only; but they are prejudiced by the impertinence
of the Age, and <HI>our Men,</HI> who ought to Conver&s;e with the Patient and
his Relations with Progno&s;ticks only, which are the honour of Phy&s;ick, and
not play the Philo&s;opher by fanciful and pre|carious Interpretations of the
Nature of Di&s;ea&s;es and Medicines, to gain a &s;ort of <PB N="243" REF="128">Credit with the Ignorant; and &s;uch cer|tainly are all tho&s;e that
have not &s;tudied Phy&s;ick thoroughly, and in earne&s;t.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Drops were de&s;ired of me by other Per&s;ons of Quality, as
the Prince&s;s <HI>d'E&s;pinoy,</HI> the Duche&s;s of <HI>Boullon,</HI>
Mon|&s;ieur <HI>Se&s;ac, &amp;c.</HI> and having bethought my &s;elf how my
Ma&s;ter, the late King <HI>Charles,</HI> had communicated them to me, and
&s;hewed me very obligingly the Pro|ce&s;s him&s;elf, by carrying me alone with
him into his Elaboratory at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> while it was Di&s;tilling.
Al&s;o Mr. <HI>Che|vins</HI> another time &s;hewed me the Mate|rials for the
Drops in his Appartment newly brought in, in great quantity, that is, <HI>Raw
Silk.</HI> I cau&s;ed the Drops to be made here. Al&s;o I put Dr.
<HI>Turnfort</HI> upon making of them; which he did in perfection, by
Di&s;tilling the fine&s;t Raw Silk he could get. For my part I was
&s;ur|pri&s;ed at the Experiment often repeated, having never tried it before.
One Pound of Raw Silk yielded an incredible quanti|ty of Volatil Salt, and in
proportion the fine&s;t Spirit I ever ta&s;ted; and that which recommends it
is, that it is when rectified, of a far more plea&s;ant &s;mell, than that
which comes from Sal Armoniack or Hart&s;horne; and the Salt refined and
cohobated with any well &s;cented Chimical Oil, makes the <PB N="244" REF="129"><HI>Kings Salt,</HI> as its us'd to be called. This my Lord
Amba&s;&s;ador gave me leave to pre&s;ent in his Name; and the Doctor now
&s;upplies tho&s;e which want. Silk, indeed is nothing el&s;e, but a dry Jelly
from the In&s;ect Kind, and therefore very Cordial and Stomachick no doubt. The
<HI>Arabians</HI> were wi&s;e, and knowing in the <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> to
have put it in their <HI>Alkermes.</HI></P>
<P>This mu&s;t be &s;aid for the Honour of this King, that he has ever
given great Encouragements for u&s;eful Di&s;coveries in all Kinds, and
particularly in Phy&s;ick. 'Tis well known he bought the Secret of the
Je&s;uits Powder, and made it pub|lick; as he lately did that of the
<HI>Hypo|cocana.</HI></P>
<P>To Conclude, it was my good Fortune here to have a Bundle of
Original Pa|pers of Sir <HI>Theodore Mayerne,</HI> and his Friends, who
Corre&s;ponded with him, pre&s;ented me by the Reverend Dr. <HI>Wickar,</HI>
Dean of <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> who Marrying his Kin&s;woman found them
among&s;t other Writings of Law Matters. I have not yet had the lei&s;ure to
peru&s;e them, but tho&s;e who know the Worth of that great Man, will de&s;ire
they may be made pub|lick; which if they are, they &s;hall come <PB REF="132"> 
<PB N="245" REF="132">forth intire, and not di&s;gui&s;ed, as &s;ome of his
other Papers have been, to the great detriment of Phy&s;ick; and I think it is
the fir&s;t Example of this Nature, that Po&s;thumous Papers were ever
abre|viated, and made what they never were, before an intire and full
publication.</P>
