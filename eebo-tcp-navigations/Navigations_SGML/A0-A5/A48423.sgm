<HEAD>THE VOYAGE OF Mon&s;ieur MARTINIERE INTO THE <HI>Northern CO&V;NTRIES.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> The Author imbarking at <HI>Co|penhagen</HI> in a Ve&s;sel belong|ing to the King of <HI>Den|marks Northern-Compa|ny,</HI> and of his arrival at <HI>Chri&s;tiania</HI> in <HI>Norway.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the year 1647. <HI>Iredrich</HI> the third of that name, King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> out of the care of his Subjects, and advance|ment of their Trade, Erected two Com|panies in <HI>Copenhagen</HI> (the Metropolis
<PB N="2" REF="7">of his Kingdom) one of them for <HI>I&s;lande,</HI> the other for the <HI>North:</HI> which la&s;t, ha|ving ob&s;erv'd the advantage of their Traffick into <HI>Norway,</HI> prevailed with tho&s;e who were concerned in their Pa|tent, about the end of <HI>February</HI> 1653. to repre&s;ent to his Maje&s;ty the profits would probably accrue if they carried their Trade up further than as yet they had done; and that they &s;hould return doubtle&s;s with &s;everal Commodities which at pre&s;ent they wanted.</P>
<P>The King having received their Peti|tion, was plea&s;ed Graciou&s;ly to con&s;ent, and the Company thereupon immedi|ately cau&s;ed three Ships to be Equip'd in order to that Voyage.</P>
<P>Being at <HI>Copenhagen</HI> at that time, and under&s;tanding his Maje&s;ty had com|manded tho&s;e who were to make that Voyage, &s;hould take the &s;trickte&s;t and mo&s;t exact account of all the Coa&s;ts and Places they came at, and report them with all po&s;&s;ible curio&s;ity, that thereby the Voyage might be every way beneficial, I was incouraged to addre&s;s my &s;elf to a Friend of mine who had a principal intere&s;t in that affair, and to de&s;ire his Mediation to the Company,
<PB N="3" REF="7">that I might be received, and go as Chi|rurgion to one of tho&s;e Ships.</P>
<P>Being provided with all things nece&s;&s;ary, within &s;ix days we Embark'd, and with a fair South-Ea&s;t wind &s;et Sail, Coa&s;ting by the Shoar as far as <HI>Katgat</HI> (by the French call'd <HI>Trou de chat</HI>) which is a Streight dividing the <HI>German</HI> Ocean from the <HI>Baltick</HI> Sea; a place very dangerous to pa&s;s in re&s;pect of the Rocks, and con|taining in length fourty Leagues from <HI>El&s;enore</HI> to <HI>Scagerhort.</HI></P>
<P>When we were put off of <HI>Mae&s;trand</HI> (which is a &s;mall Port about thirty Leagues from <HI>Copenhagen</HI>) we were &s;ur|prized with a fierce Wind from the North, and driven ten Leagues back again, which forc'd us to make for a Harbour, and re|tire under the Shore to <HI>Schllot,</HI> where we lay at Shelter under the Ca&s;tle, though it appeared to us but an old uninhabitable heap of &s;tones, abandon'd for &s;everal years, and con&s;iderable for nothing but the Eminence of the Neighbouring Pro|montories.</P>
<P>Having lyen there at Anchor two days compleat, the third before Sun-ri&s;e by the benefit of an Ea&s;terly Wind, we weighed again to pro&s;ecute our Voyage.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="8">
<P>We had not Sail'd above four hours before we were interrupted by a North-North-Ea&s;t Wind which drove us from the Coa&s;t of <HI>Gottenburg,</HI> upon the Shore of <HI>Jutland,</HI> upon which there being mul|titude of Sands, we were forc'd to &s;ound every moment: Sailing in this manner, a &s;udden Gu&s;t of Wind carried us into a place where we found but three fathoms and a half Water, where we had undoubt|edly &s;truck, had not the dexterity of our Pilot turned our Ship, and by the advan|tage of a favourable Bla&s;t, carried us in half an hours time into another place where we &s;ounded fifteen Fathoms and upward, which obliged us to keep the Sea with a &s;ide Wind as well as we were able, lea&s;t otherwi&s;e we &s;hould have been forc'd back as before.</P>
<P>We had not gain'd above two Leagues from the place where we had like to have &s;truck, before we fell into a turn of Wa|ters, which in &s;pight of the Wind &s;topt our Ve&s;&s;el on &s;udden, as if we had ca&s;t Anchor, which con&s;tpained us to furle all our Sails but the Mizen, and gave us twelve hours imployment to di&s;ingage our &s;elves, which notwith&s;tanding we could not have been able to have done,
<PB N="5" REF="8">had not the Wind Veer'd to the South-South-We&s;t, and given us opportunity to make u&s;e of the re&s;t of our Sails, and &s;teer along the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Bahu.</HI></P>
<P>Having Sailed in this manner &s;ome Days and Nights at our Ea&s;e, we di&s;co|vered about eight in the Morning, the Promentories of <HI>Chri&s;tian&s;and,</HI> a little Town famous for the convenience of its Port, from whence the next Night we arrived at <HI>Chri&s;tiania.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Particulars of the Country about <HI>Chri&s;ti|ania,</HI> the Manners and Cu&s;toms of the Pe&s;antry in <HI>Norway.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BEing entred into the Port of <HI>Chri&s;ti|ania,</HI> we immediately went a Shore, in order to the delivering of Letters we had to two Merchants which were re&s;i|dent there, and Members of the Compa|ny, who under&s;tanding by them that our de&s;ign was for advancing our Trade into the North, and by the King of <HI>Denmarks</HI> con&s;ent, received us very kindly, and treated us magnificently.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="9">
<P>One of tho&s;e Merchants finding I was a &s;tranger, recommended by one of the chief of the Company, to &s;how me as much of the Country as was po&s;&s;ible at that time, commanded one of his Ser|vants, who &s;poke <HI>French,</HI> to accompany me two or three Leagues into the Coun|try, and accordingly being each of us mounted on Hor&s;e-back, early the next Morning we marched together to <HI>Wisby,</HI> a great Village &s;ome three Leagues from <HI>Chri&s;tiania</HI> built betwixt two Mountains, the hou&s;es of Wood, without any Iron Work or Windows, the light coming in a top at a kind of a Lanthorn made of turf and &s;ods of Earth.</P>
<P>The Pea&s;ants of <HI>Norway</HI> are plain hearted, ho&s;pitable, given much to Fi&s;h|ing, their principal Commerce being in Herrings, Mulletts, Codds, Stock-&s;i&s;h, and other &s;orts both Salt and Dry; they are generally Slaves to the Gentry.</P>
<P>The Women are mo&s;t of them hand|&s;ome, but frickand; they love Strangers, are good Hou&s;wives, Spin all their own Cloth, and look to their Cattel, of which they have great quantity, as in <HI>France;</HI> They have great &s;tore of Game, as Elks, Staggs, Roe-Bucks, Wild-Goats, Boars,
<PB N="7" REF="9">Dear, Rabbets, Hares, all kind of Fowl, be&s;ides Otters, Beaver, Lynxes, and wild Catts of &s;everal Colours.</P>
<P><HI>Norway</HI> is a Mountainous Country for the mo&s;t part, uncapable of Corn &s;o much as for Bread, though they have of it good &s;tore, but Tran&s;ported from other Countries by means of their Navigation; however the &s;carcity of Arrable is abun|dantly recompenced in the plenty of their Pa&s;ture, and multitude of Woods.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Their way of Hunting the Elkes. The Ridiculous Opinion af the Virtue of their Claw, the Power and Authority of the <HI>Norwegian</HI> Noble&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>IN our return from <HI>Wisby</HI> to <HI>Chri&s;ti|ania,</HI> we were met by a Gentleman and his two Servants going a Hunting with their Dogs at their Heels. The Gentleman knowing the per&s;on who was with me, ask'd him if we would divert our &s;elves, and &s;ee the Hunting of an Elke, which we accepted, and marching with him about a quarter of a League,
<PB N="8" REF="10">we met one of the Gentlemans Hunts|men with ten or twelve Country-fellows which conducted us about three quarters of a League further into a great Wood, &s;o thick, we were forced to leave our Hor&s;es with one of his Servants, and go in on foot.</P>
<P>The Game being prepared the day be|fore by his Servants, we had not pa&s;&s;'d two Pi&s;tol &s;hot into the Wood, when we &s;aw a large <HI>Elke</HI> running before us and fall down on a &s;udden without any noi&s;e of a Gun, nor indeed &s;hot; the &s;trange|ne&s;s of the &s;ight, cau&s;ed me to inquire of my Guid what might be the rea&s;on, and he told me it was a &s;ort of Falling-&s;ick|ne&s;s peculiar to that kind of Bea&s;t, from whence among them it had its denomi|nation, <HI>Elend,</HI> (as they call them) being as <HI>mi&s;erable</HI> with us. This Creature was about the bigne&s;s of a large Hor&s;e, bo|died like a Stagg, but broader, its Leggs longer, his foot large and cloven, his head large, and Velvet; Were it not for this Di&s;temper it would be no ea&s;ie mat|ter to take them, which I perceived by this Gentleman, who when he had kill'd this in its Fit, undertook another, and ran it two full hours without any effect,
<PB N="9" REF="10">nor had he ever taken it, had it not fallen down with the &s;ame Di&s;ea&s;e as the former, after it had &s;lain three of his Dogs with its fore feet; which put the poor Gentleman into &s;uch a fume, he would Hunt no more that day. He &s;ent for a little Chariot to a Farm-hou&s;e he had about half a League off, to carry home his <HI>Elke</HI> to his own hou&s;e, which was built <HI>all antique,</HI> as the re&s;t of that Coun|try are, to which he would needs have us bear him Company, and entertained us hand&s;omely when we came there.</P>
<P>The Gentleman under&s;tanding by my Camerade I was a Stranger, recommended by &s;everal of the <HI>Norway</HI> Company at <HI>Co|penhagen,</HI> obliged him to give me (as a Te&s;timony of his Friend&s;hip) the two hinder feet of the <HI>Elke</HI> he kill'd la&s;t, and to let me know it was a Soveraign reme|dy again&s;t the Falling-&s;ickne&s;s, which which when he delivered I could not but &s;mile, and de&s;ir'd him to let the Gentle|man know I wondered much the Foot having the virtue he mentioned, the poor <HI>Elkes</HI> could not cure them&s;elves, &s;eeing they had them always about them. The Gentleman reflecting upon what I &s;aid, fell a laughing him&s;elf, and told me I had
<PB N="10" REF="11">rea&s;on, he told me he had try'd it many times upon People in that Di&s;temper, but without any benefit; and ingeniou&s;ly confe&s;&s;'d he look'd upon that virtue, but as pretended, and a meer popular Error.</P>
<P>The next morning early, having broken our Fa&s;t with the Gentleman, we gave him thanks for our Entertainment, and taking our leaves we arriv'd at <HI>Chri&s;tiania.</HI></P>
<P>Having in the precedent Chapter &s;po|ken of the Manners of the Pea&s;ants, I &s;hall in this, give the Gentry this Cha|racter, They are Wi&s;e, Wary, and yet Brave; they po&s;&s;e&s;s all the great Offices of that Kingdom, are Soveraign in their particular Territories, Tyrants to their Tenants, good Soldiers both by Land and by Sea, and addicted to Travel.</P>

<P>HAving &s;tayed four or five days at <HI>Chri&s;tiania,</HI> we took our leaves of our two Merchants of the Northern Company, who confirmed our Orders, and wi&s;h'd us a good Voyage. Being re|imbarqued we weighed Anchor, got out of the Port, and pur&s;ued our Journey by the favour of a North-Ea&s;t Wind, which which continued as far as <HI>Stafanger,</HI> where we were taken with &s;o great a Calm, that (not able to advance) we were ob|liged (to entertain our &s;elves, and pa&s;s away the time) to betake our &s;elves to Fi&s;hing. The Coa&s;t of <HI>Norway</HI> abound|ing &s;o plentifully with Fi&s;h of all &s;orts, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">  took them in &s;uch Multitudes, as made us keep Lent, though at another time of the year.</P>
<P>The Calm having continued us in that place five entire days, on the &s;ixth at Night, we were befriended with a fre&s;h
<PB N="12" REF="12">Gale from South-Ea&s;t, which in no long time carried us to <HI>Bergen</HI> whither we were to go, and di&s;charge our &s;elves of &s;uch Merchandize as was de&s;igned to that place.</P>
<P>Being entred into the Harbour (which is one of the be&s;t in <HI>Europe</HI>) and being come to an Anchor, while they were un|lading. I took a view of Town, which is abont the bigne&s;s of <HI>Abeville,</HI> part of it built high upon the Rocks, and part of it on the Shore. Tis now con&s;iderable principally for its Trade, though ancient|ly an Arch-Bi&s;hoprick, but &s;ince the Re|formation in tho&s;e parts, that is aboli&s;h|ed, and the Bi&s;hops Palace is given to three Hans Towns, <HI>Hamborough, Lubech,</HI> and <HI>Bremen,</HI> as a Store-hou&s;e for their goods, and &s;everal priviledges confirm'd to them by the King of <HI>Denmark.</HI></P>

<P>We had not pa&s;&s;ed above half the way, before the Wind increa&s;ed &s;o fa&s;t upon us, that in fifteen or &s;ixteen hours we came up with <HI>the Store,</HI> but in an in&s;tant it

<P>There being nothing more tedious to the Sea-men then a Calm, not knowing how to imploy them&s;elves, they fell again to their old recreation of Fi&s;hing, and took &s;uch quantitie of a &s;ort they call <HI>Klipen-fi&s;h,</HI> they were con&s;trained to Salt great part of them, which &s;tood us in good &s;tead afterwards.</P>

<P>AS &s;oon as we were landed, we went to deliver our Letters to the Inten|dant General of the Mines, and made it our reque&s;t he would order our Grain to be received as &s;oon as was po&s;&s;ible; but he told us his Officers were all at the Mines, for &s;ome of whom he mu&s;t &s;end on purpo&s;e before it could be received, which when I under&s;tood, I entreated our Ma&s;ter I might be permitted to go along with the Me&s;&s;enger, and he granted my de&s;ire.</P>
<P>The next Morning betimes the Me&s;&s;en|ger and I were both of us on Hor&s;e-back, and rode together as far as <HI>Steckby,</HI> a great Town about &s;ix Leagues from <HI>Dronthem,</HI> where we judg'd it be&s;t to take up, as well becau&s;e Night was coming on (though but three a Clock) as that we were to pa&s;s a great Wood full of Woolfs and Bears, and Lynxes, which

<P>The next Morning by Sun-ri&s;ing we left <HI>Steckby,</HI> pur&s;uing our journey to the Mines.

<P>THE next Morning by break of day the Me&s;&s;enger with whom I came, departed with a <HI>Commis</HI> for <HI>Drontham,</HI> having left me in charge with one of the Ma&s;ter Miners, who being to follow the day after, was to bring me along with him. As &s;oon I was up, I went out to find out my <HI>Commis</HI> which &s;pake French, who had provided a good break-fa&s;t as well for him&s;elf and me, as for the Ma&s;ter Miner my Governour; and whil&s;t we were at it, the <HI>Commis</HI> de&s;ired the &s;aid Ma&s;ter that he would carry me down into the Mines, and let me &s;ee them work.</P>
<P>When we had broke our fa&s;t, we pa&s;&s;ed about fifty paces from the Forges, which are built upon an high Mountain near the mouth of the Mine; upon the Edge of it is an Engine called a Crane, which is turn'd by two men by the help of two Wheels, one going into one, the other into the other, and turning them about, they drew up great peices from the Mine,
<PB N="18" REF="15">&s;ometimes in Ore, &s;ometimes in Earth, as they do your Square-&s;tone and Pot-Earth at <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>The Ma&s;ter Miner and I put our &s;elves into a Tub of Wood, hoop'd about with Iron, and Ropes fa&s;tned to them, in which we were let down into the Mine, above fifty fathom deep.</P>
<P>Being come down I could not imagine my &s;elf any where but in Hell, there be|ing nothing to be &s;een but dark di&s;mal Holes, great Fires, and the Miners like &s;o many Devils, clad all of them in black Leather, with a hood of the &s;ame &s;tuff over their heads, in fa&s;hion of what our Prie&s;ts wear in Winter, it was cut &s;harp towards the bottom, and the other broad end fa&s;tned over their No&s;e (to pre&s;erve them again&s;t fumes) and an apron of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Their work in the&s;e Mines is &s;everal, &s;ome cutting and chizelling the Ore, others probing with their in&s;truments, as well to find out the Copper Veins, as to di&s;cover the Water, which &s;ometimes ly|ing hid in the ground, upon the lea&s;t pa&s;|&s;age, breake out with &s;o violent an Erup|tion as would drown them all, were they not exceedingly careful.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="15">
<P>The Ma&s;ter Miner who accompanied me down, perceiving I was affrighted, and &s;urprized with a &s;trange chilne&s;s be|&s;ides, rung the Bell to give notice above to draw us up again which they did in almo&s;t as little time as we went down, and then return'd to the Forges, where we found my French Interpreter atten|ding us at Dinner.</P>
<P>After Dinner the Commis cau&s;ed three Hor&s;es to be &s;adled for him&s;elf, the Ma&s;ter Miner, and me, to go &s;ee the Silver Mines, about two Leagues beyond, where being arriv'd, we alighted at the Inten|dants hou&s;e, who received us very kind|ly, pre&s;enting each of us with a good gla&s;s of &s;trong Waters, he having drank fir&s;t a brimmer to bid us welcome, and after that he treated us with Tobacco and Beer.</P>
<P>Having treated us in this manner, he conducted us to the Forges which are about a quarter of a League from his hou&s;e, much of the &s;ame nature with the Copper Forges, with &s;everal people at work, &s;ome &s;eparating, &s;ome wa&s;hing, &s;ome melting, others refining, and others coining for the &s;ervice of his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<PB N="20" REF="16">
<P>From the Forges we pa&s;&s;ed to the Mine, which is in a Mountain over again&s;t them, into which I went down with the Ma&s;ter, as I did into the Copper Mines. I found no difference betwixt them, the holes, fires and habits, with the manner and time of working being exactly the &s;ame; that is to &s;ay, in the Spring and Fall they work three hours in the fore|noon, and three in the afternoon, in &s;ummer four before dinner, and four after; the re&s;t they rejoyce, dancing to their Ho-boys Violins, and other In&s;truments, as it was my fortune to &s;ee them the fir&s;t night I came to the Copper Forges; du|ring the Winter quarter they work not at all, but are paid as when they work, at the rate of five &s;hillings a day.</P>
<P>Having &s;een all the Silver Mines, we return'd to the Intendants lodging, where we &s;upp'd and lay. The next Morning having broke our fa&s;t, we took leave of our Intendant, and mounting on Hor&s;e|back, we dined at the Copper Mines, from whence, having taken leave of my Com|mis which &s;poke French, the Ma&s;ter Mi|ner and I departed in our journey to <HI>Dron|them.</HI></P>

<P>WE had not trsvelled above two Leagues and a half, before we were overtaken by the Night, and forc'd to take our &s;elves to the hou&s;e of a Coun|try-man of the Ma&s;ter Miners acquain|tance, which was not far off, who to &s;peak truth, received us very hand&s;omly, con&s;idering his condition, giving us for a Supper a brace of Phea&s;ants: and a hun|ted hare which he had killed after an hours cha&s;e, (which is free in that Coun|try to all People) be&s;ides Beer, To|bacco, and Strong-waters when we came in.</P>
<P>After Supper we fell a &s;moaking again like Dragons, and drank Strong-waters for a better or a wor&s;e, and continued our Frolick till it was well near Mor|ning.</P>
<P>The poor Pea&s;ant &s;eeing the Ma&s;ter Miner had made him&s;elf drunk to do him an honour, was &s;o tran&s;ported with the

<P>TWo days after, having unladen what was there to be delivered, and re|ceived what provi&s;ions the Intendant Ge|neral had Orders to procure us, the Wind being favourable, we went on Board, and &s;ome few hours after, &s;et Sail in order to our Voyage.</P>
<P>For &s;ome days togethep we Sailed very happily, till we came under the Arctick Circle, where we were &s;uddenly becalm'd, not far from the Coa&s;ts.</P>
<P>Being informed that the People which inhabit about the &s;aid Circle, as well as they which live about the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Fin|land,</HI> are for the mo&s;t part Sorcerers, and di&s;po&s;e of the Wind as they plea&s;e, we cau&s;ed our Sloop to be prepared, and &s;ome of our Sea-men went on Shore to the next Village they could meet with, to purcha&s;e one for us. They inquired for the be&s;t Necromancer the Town did
<PB N="24" REF="18">afford; and having addre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to him, they told him whither they were bound, and de&s;ired him to furni&s;h them with a Wind would carry them to <HI>Mour|manskoimore.</HI> He told them he could not, and that his power extended no fur|ther then the Promontories of <HI>Rouxella;</HI> which place being a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, and not far from the North-Cape, they thought good to take him along into their Ship, and make their bargain with him there. To which end they made bold with a &s;mall Fi&s;her-boat they found there, and putting him and three of his Camerades into it, they convey'd them a board, where we bargained with him for a pound of Tobacco, and ten Crowns in Silver, for which they fa&s;tned to a corner of our fore-ma&s;t Sail, a piece of Linnen Cloth about a foot long, and four fingers broad, in which having tyed three knots, they told us that would do, and then entred into their Skip to re|turn.</P>
<P>They were no &s;ooner out of the Ve&s;&s;el, but our Ma&s;ter untyed the fir&s;t knot in the Ragg, and immediately we had a We&s;t South-we&s;t Wind, the plea&s;ante&s;t in the World, which darried us and the
<PB N="25" REF="18">Ships of our Company, thirty Leagues beyond <HI>Mael&s;troom</HI> before we had occa&s;i|on to unty another.</P>
<P>This <HI>Mael&s;troom</HI> is the greate&s;t Whirl|pool in all the Norwegian Sea, in which ma|ny Ships peri&s;h by coming too near it be|fore they are aware; for which rea&s;on &s;uch as know the danger, and are better ac|quainted with the Rode, &s;tand off eight or ten Leagues higher into the Sea, to avoid a great number of Rocks, and other tur|nings of water which lye out &s;ix or feaven leagues from the Shore.</P>
<P>The wind vering and coming about to the <HI>North,</HI> our Ma&s;ter open'd the &s;econd knot, and it became favourable again as &s;ar as the Mountains of <HI>Rouxilla,</HI> where we had no fooner doubled the point, but our Compa&s;s varied on a &s;uddain, and the Needle went back above &s;ix points, which made us conjecture there were Load&s;tones in tho&s;e Mountains, whether there were or not, this I am &s;ure, had not our Pilot been expert, we had mi&s;taken our way.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing the re&s;t of our Ships in the &s;ame condition, our Pilat laid by his Compa&s;s, and hanging out a flag upon his Mizen, he gave a &s;ignal to the others to follow him, that place being very well
<PB N="26" REF="19">known to him, in re&s;pect he had made &s;e|veral voyages thither with the Dutch, who &s;ail only by their Sea-Chart when they come in that place.</P>
<P>Two whole days and nights we conti|nued in this perplexity, after which being got at &s;ome di&s;tance from the Mountains, our Needle return'd to its Center, which gave us to under&s;tand we were not far from the Cape, but the wind beginning to &s;lacken, our Ma&s;ter unty'd the third knot, which was the la&s;t he had.</P>

<PB N="27" REF="19">but to broken in pieces and drown|ed.</P>
<P>Being not above 12. Leagues from the &s;hore, and with much labour &s;carce able to keep the Sea, yet we could not imagine the power of the &s;torm could have driven us thither in &s;pight of our teeth, but we reckon'd without our Ho&s;t, for the third day about noon there aro&s;e &s;o fierce and &s;uddain a &s;torm, as blowed us among the Rocks, and da&s;h'd us pre&s;ently upon one of them, about thirty Leagues upward of the Cape, and four from the Shore. The whole Ship fetch'd a great skriek, and eve|ry man fell to his prayers, believing that day would be the la&s;t of our lives. The truth is, I nor none of the re&s;t were ever more in danger, all expecting when our Ve&s;&s;el &s;hould &s;plit. But by extraordinary providence the greatne&s;s and &s;orce of the waves di&s;ingaged us, and threw us near a Pi&s;tol-Shot off of the Rock, without any con&s;iderable prejudice more than a &s;mall hole in the Keel, which took a lit|tle water, and &s;ome few boards loo&s;n'd and &s;plinter'd, which kept us clo&s;e to our Pump, and gave us con&s;tant imployment.</P>
<P>The fourth day the Storm being abated and the sky cleer, not &s;eeing the re&s;t of our

<P>Finding our Ship leak, and our labour in pumping great and continual, it was thought be&s;t to make for &s;ome convenient Harbour, where we might Caulk, and re|fit, but the North Sea being full of Rocks all along upon the Coa&s;ts, and their Crceks and Ports by that means inacce&s;&s;ible, we were con&s;train'd to keep out two days lon|ger at Sea, before we could put in &s;ecuri|ty.

<P>The Men and Women are low, but &s;trong &s;et, and active, their face broad, flat nos'd, and tawny, but not &s;o much as others more North, their eyes are little like Hogs eyes, their eye-brows large and reaching almo&s;t to their Temples; they are heavy and &s;tupid, without any civility, very la&s;civious e&s;pecially the women, pro|&s;tituting them&s;elves to all commers, as often as they can do it with &s;ecurity from their husbands.</P>

<P>HAving unladen our Ve&s;&s;el the next day after our arrival at <HI>Varanger,</HI> the people of the Town were very helpful to us in the turning and refitting of it, for the Ma&s;ter finding it in a much wor&s;e conditi|on than he imagined, he de&s;ired the inha|bitants to find him out wood that might be proper to repair it, which they did up|on a Mountain not far off, and brought it to him when they had done.</P>
<P>The Commi&s;s. for the Merchants percieving it would take up &s;ome time before our &s;hip could be fitted, thought it convenient to pa&s;s higher into the Coun|try, and &s;ee if they had any thing there, to barter for his Commodities: with this de&s;ign he made choice of me and two o|thers to bear him Company, and the next morning (the 12 of <HI>March</HI>) we took our Tobacco and linnen cloth to traffique, our bi&s;cuit and &s;alt meat for our provant, and with three of the Natives (as well to car|ry our provi&s;ion as to conduct us) we ad|vanced
<PB N="37" REF="24">thorough Woods, Mountains val|lies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> till about four a clock in the e|vening, at which time we de&s;cribed two great and fierce white Bears m king to|wards us, which gave us no little appre|hen&s;ion.</P>
<P>Our Convoy percieving our fright, ad|vi&s;ed us not to be troubled, telling us if they &s;hould make at us, we had no more to do but to &s;tand to our Arms and they would be gon; and for experiment &s;ake we fell to fitting our flint, and priming our pan, which they no &s;ooner percieved but (either affrighted with the fla&s;hing of pan or the &s;mell of the power) away they ran, and we heard of them no more, about an hour after coming down a Moun|tain, we di&s;covered about a dozen hou&s;es at a good di&s;tance from one another, and a little farther two herds of creatures like Stags, which our Guides told us were <HI>Elks.</HI></P>
<P>Being got to that Town, they brought us to a Cabane where we repos'd our &s;elves being much tyred by the length and trou|ble&s;omne&s;s of our journey, and the weight of the Luggage we brought along with us. The fir&s;t thing we did, we pre&s;ented our Landlord with a piece of Tobacco, which
<PB N="38" REF="25">pleas'd him exceedingly, and he told us he had not had &s;uch a pre&s;ent in nine Months before, and to recompence our kindne&s;s, he gave us &s;ome of his <HI>Aqua-vitae,</HI> a piece of fre&s;h <HI>Elks</HI> fle&s;h, and dryed Fi&s;h, which we di&s;tributed to our guides, and fea&s;ted them, whil'&s;t we made &s;hift with our own provi&s;ions; after which we laid our &s;elves down upon certain large white Bear skins and went to &s;leep according to the mode of that Country.</P>

<PB N="39" REF="25">they gave us &s;ome for our Tobacco, and &s;ome for our Cloth.</P>
<P>There being no more traffique to be had there, we intreated our Landlord to fur|ni&s;h us with <HI>Elks</HI> to carry us farther into the Country, which we no &s;ooner pro|pos'd, but &s;tepping out of the door, he took his Horn, and blew for the <HI>Elks,</HI> which came to him forthwith, to the number of fourteen or fifteen. He took &s;ix of them harne&s;&s;ed them, and then put them into &s;ix Sledges, made in the fa&s;hion of a <HI>Gon|dela,</HI> &s;upported by &s;ix little Rafters, fa&s;t|ned to a piece of wood about two foot longer than the Sledge; we put our Com|modities into one of them, and having paid in Tobacco two of our Guides, and di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed them, we retained the third (who had been in the other <HI>Laponia</HI> under the Government of the Duke of <HI>Mu&s;covie,</HI> and under&s;tood their Language well, as al&s;o the Country and Language of the <HI>Killopes</HI>) to conduct us as a Guide.</P>
<P>Having placed our &s;elves every man in his Sledge in the <HI>Lapland</HI> habits which we had bought of the Natives, we were each of us covered with a Bear-skin, having, them fa&s;tned us to with a large thong of <HI>Elk</HI>-Leather to our Charriot, they gave us two

<P>When we were ju&s;t ready to depart, our Landlord to whom the <HI>Elks</HI> did belong, mumbled out certain words into the ears of every one of them, telling them as (we &s;uppo&s;ed) whither they were to carry us, upon which they gave &s;uch a &s;pring, we thought we had had &s;o many Divels in our Sledges, and at that rate they carried us over Mountains and Valleys out of all bea|ten Roads, till about &s;eaven a clock at night, at which time they brought us to a large Country-Village &s;cituate among the Mountains near a great Lake, and then &s;topped at the fourth ho u&s;e we came to, &s;tamping all of them with one of their feet as it were to give notice of their arrival.

<P>They put &s;ix <HI>Elks</HI> into &s;ix Sledges, into one of which we put our goods, and mounted the re&s;t our &s;elves, after which they covered and fa&s;tned us as before, and having whi&s;per'd their directions into the Ears of their <HI>Elks,</HI> away they went with a vengeance; hurrying us along almo&s;t full &s;peed till two in the afternoon before we came near any Hou&s;e, and about three they brought us to a little Village of &s;ome eight hou&s;es, built upon a high Mountain near a great Wood, where they &s;topp'd on a &s;uddain, and made us believe we were
<PB N="45" REF="28">at our journies end, but no body coming to us, we were forced to bait our <HI>Elks</HI> up|on the <HI>Mo&s;s,</HI> (which was there in good &s;tore) our &s;elves upon our &s;alt meat and bi&s;cuit, and our Interpreter upon his Fi&s;h, making bold now and then with a Bottle of Strong-waters our la&s;t Land|lord had given us.</P>
<P>Having re&s;ted a Matter of an hour, our Guide (who under&s;tood to make an <HI>Elk</HI> march as well as the be&s;t of them) had much ado to per&s;wade ours any farther; that being the place (as it &s;eem'd) to which they were directed, which put the poor man upon a great many odd Ce|remonies, going five or &s;ix times alone in|to the wood, and then back again, &s;till whi&s;pering into their Ears at his return, and all would &s;carce do, at length they were good natur'd, and went on, but not with that &s;peed and alacrity they came thi|ther.</P>
<P>We asked him how it came to pa&s;s we found no body in that Village, and he told us in tho&s;e parts it was no wonder; that we were now in the Country of the <HI>Kil|lopes,</HI> which are a &s;ort of <HI>Laplanders</HI> le&s;s civiliz'd than any of the re&s;t, changing their quarters very often, to avoid the

<P>As we were drinking with the Inhabi|tants, and &s;moaking of Tobacco, we cau|s'd him to ask if they had no Commodities to barter, and they replying they had Furs, we de&s;ir'd to &s;ee them, and they fetched them imediately. There were White,

<P>THe day we arrived at <HI>Varanger</HI> our Ma&s;ter began to caulk, and the next had fini&s;hed, and our Ship being once a|gain in good order, he caus'd our goods to be be put on Board. While we &s;taid, we treated the Inhabitants with Strong-Wa|ters and Tobacco, le&s;t they &s;hould ob&s;truct our departure, and hinder our Wind; but they were &s;o far from that, that about five days after being the 26. of <HI>May</HI> (as if in recompence of our kindne&s;s) there aro&s;e &s;o plea&s;ant and convenient a Wind to carry us out of that Sea, we took the advantage, weighed, and were under Sail about &s;eaven at night.</P>
<P>The wind increa&s;ing, to avoid the Rocks in the middle of the pa&s;&s;age into the main Ocean, we came to Anchor near the Shore over again&s;t the I&s;le of <HI>Wardbus,</HI> from whence the Commi&s;s of the Ca&s;tle perceiving us, and knowing who we were, came with his Shallop on Board us, and

<P>The next day being the 27. the Sun ap|pearing with his rays about one a Clock in the night, we weighed again, &s;tanding directly for the main Sea, which by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a fre&s;h Gale, we might pro|bably gain, &s;teering <HI>N.

<P>We had not Sailed three times four and twenty hours, before the night for|&s;ook us quite, the Sun continuing always in our &s;ight either behind, before, or on one &s;ide of us.</P>
<P>The la&s;t of <HI>May</HI> we di&s;covered the Mountains called <HI>Spite Bergen,</HI> but being ob&s;tructed with a North wind which blew very hard, not able to keep the Sea, we were forced to leave them to the <HI>N.

<P>For three days and nights we were in no little danger, much incommoded by the Ice, which being broken and &s;epera|ted by the agitation of the Tempe&s;t, came upon us in great pieces, da&s;hing with that

But the wind blowing hard again at the North we were glad to &s;teer towards the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Boranday</HI> which we reached in few hours, and put into a Bay which we found there, very convenient to &s;helter us again&s;t the winds, and furni&s;hing us with twelve or thirteen fathom water.</P>

<P>HAving repos'd for &s;ix or &s;eaven hours upon Pallats of <HI>Bears</HI>-skins, which our Landlord had &s;pread upon the ground for our entertainment, we got up and in|quired if they had nothing to truck, upon which they produced &s;everal <HI>Woolf</HI>-skins, white <HI>Foxes,</HI> two dozen of <HI>Ermins,</HI> about three hundred <HI>Squirrels,</HI> and &s;eaven pair of <HI>Sables.</HI> They would not meddle with our Tobacco, as not being &s;o &s;weet tooth'd and well bred as their Country|men upon the coa&s;t, living only upon hunting. In Summer their diet is fre&s;h meat boyl'd or broyl'd upon the Coals. In Winter nothing but dry meat, which they provide in the Summer by drying it in the Sun upon a Wheel or on the top of their Hou&s;es, which are built very low, cover|ed over with branches of trees and Turfs of Earth, without any light but what comes in at the door, which as afore&s;aid is like the mouth of an Oven.</P>

<P>The&s;e <HI>Borandines</HI> (as our Guides told us) change their Quarters as often as the <HI>Killopes,</HI> they live bruti&s;hly without any Religion, and are more &s;tupid then any we met with, They are as ill-&s;haped as their Neighbours. Their Shoos are of the Bark of a Tree, their Stockings, Breeches, Capps and Coats (which come down be|neath the Calf of their Leggs, and girt about with a Girdle about four fingers broad) are all of white <HI>Bears</HI>-skin with the hair outward. The Women are not di&s;|cernable from the Men but by their Hair, which is braided and hangs down upon their Shoulders. They are as nimble and skilful at hunting as their Husbands. Their Arms are only a pointed Stick of a certain hard-wood which pierces any thing, a wooden Bow, the String made of the Rinde of a Tree, a Quiver of Arrowes at their Backs, and a Stone that cuts like a Ra&s;our at their Gyrdle.</P>
<P>Our Trade being fini&s;hed, our Guides having provided our Sledges, and each of us taken a good draught of Strong-water, we mounted and away running on nine or ten hours together before we &s;aw man or hou&s;e, at length we perceived three or four Hou&s;es, and our Guides per&s;wa|ded
<PB N="80" REF="46">our <HI>Elks</HI> to make to them, where though we found no body, we made bold to repo&s;e our &s;elves, and refre&s;h our Cattel, who&s;e Diet was nothing but Mo&s;s, and at that place they kept a plentiful Table.</P>
<P>We eat and drank &s;uch as we had, and were as merry as Beggars, when we had done (after three hours relax) we mount|ed again, and continued our Voyage as indu&s;triou&s;ly as we could.</P>

<P>AFter fifteen hours travel (without other intermi&s;&s;ion then once to feed our <HI>Elkrs</HI> and repo&s;e our &s;elves) having &s;een neither Hou&s;e nor Man in all that time, we perceived three Hunt&s;-men be|fore us, and made up to them; one of them was habited <HI>a la Mu&s;covite</HI> in a long Robe down to his Heels, with a Girdle about his Wa&s;t four fingers broad of <HI>Woolfs</HI> skin the hair outward, it was as white as Snow, and at the point as black as Jett;
<PB N="81" REF="46">he had a Bonn et round (like a Seamans) of Black <HI>Fox,</HI> his Breeches and Stockings of <HI>Elks</HI>-skin, and his Shoos of Fi&s;h-skin, like the Inhabitants in <HI>Varanger.</HI> The other had the Ve&s;ts of the &s;ame fa&s;hion of White <HI>Bears,</HI> the hair outward, and their Shoos of Fi&s;h skin: they had each of them a dozen of <HI>Bears</HI>-skins, <HI>Woolfs</HI>-skins, White <HI>Fox,</HI> &s;ome <HI>Ermins,</HI> and very fair <HI>Sable,</HI> as I have &s;een; He that was in the White <HI>Woolfs</HI>-skin, carryed nothing but a dozen of White <HI>Crowes,</HI> and &s;eaven <HI>Sables</HI> hang|ing at his Girdle.</P>
<P>Being got up with them, one of our Guides &s;topped on a &s;uddain to &s;peak with the chief of them, and pre&s;ently alight|ing from his Sledge, put him in his place with one of our Sub-Commi&s;&s;ioners, at which my Commi&s;s. and I were very much &s;urpri&s;ed. In this manner he went along with us above an hour and we could &s;ee never a Hou&s;e; at length from the top of an high Mountain we could &s;ee the Sea on our left hand, and at the bot|tom &s;everal Hou&s;es, &s;tanding near one ano|ther like a &s;mall Town. Our <HI>Elks</HI> carri|ed us to them directly, and we alighted to repo&s;e in the Hou&s;e of that Lord whom our Guide put into his place; we knew
<PB N="82" REF="47">him to be a per&s;on of more than ordina|ry authority, by the officiou&s;ne&s;s of the Inhabitants, who ran immediately to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and helped us out of our Sled|ges with all the readine&s;s imaginable. The Towns name was <HI>Vizzora.</HI></P>
<P>The Lord &s;wopt with us for our Tobac|co and Strong-waters, and gave us in lieu all the skins he had got except his <HI>Bears</HI>-skins which we would not meddle with, and his <HI>Sables</HI> which he dur&s;t not part with, they being prohibited by the great Duke of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> (whom they call the <HI>Czar</HI>) who pre&s;erves them for him&s;elf, no body daring to &s;ell any of them in all his Dominions, but by licen&s;e from him&s;elf, or his Commi&s;&s;ioners (re&s;ident in all pla|ces where he has Magazines) under great corporal penalties, &s;o that if they &s;ell any at any time, 'tis with great caution and privacy, and they who buy them are ob|liged to keep it clo&s;e, for if the Commi&s;s. or Governor of tho&s;e places where all Merchandize is &s;earched, do find any <HI>Sa|bles</HI> which have not been &s;old by the Duke him&s;elf, his Officers, or his Licence, not only they but all the goods that Merchant hath are confiscate without redempti|on.
<PB N="83" REF="47">The <HI>Borandine</HI> Lord, having di&s;patched his own bu&s;ine&s;s, and trucked all he had him|&s;elf, knowing we had a mind to more, he &s;ent two of his Servants quite thorow the Town to give notice that if they de&s;ired to part with what skins they had, if they carryed them to us, we would give them Tobacco and Strong-water for them, and that their Ma&s;ter had dealt with us for all he had. Being glad of the opportunity, they repaired all of them with their Furs, and we bought what we thought fit.</P>
<P>Having no le&s;s than fifteen hundred skins of all &s;orts, we inquired of our Landlord if he could not provide us a Boat to &s;end one of our Seamen with our Trade to our Ships; he told us he could, and cau&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">one to be got ready, it was in the fa&s;hion of a <HI>Gondelo,</HI> broad in the middle, and pointed at both ends, all of wood, without either Iron-work or nail, in the mid&s;t it had a Ma&s;t of <HI>Firr</HI> with a great four &s;quare &s;ail (fa&s;tned to it) of Lin|nen made of the Rinde of a Tree, and Tyn&s;eld very hand&s;omly: the Cordage was made of the Rinde of Trees al&s;o, there were two Anchors belonged to it, made of a heavy kind of wood which car|ried it pre&s;ently to the bottom, and Cables
<PB N="84" REF="48">of the &s;ame with their Cordage.</P>
<P>Having appointed us two men to go a long with our Sea-Man, and &s;eeing them ready to depart, he carryed us a &s;ide, and &s;hew'd us thirty pair of <HI>Sables,</HI> which we bought of him for ready mony, at a pret|ty good rate, and were not at all &s;orry for it; had not we had the luck to have borrowed his Boat, and he &s;een it immedi|ately to be di&s;patched to our Ve&s;&s;els where he knew no Searcher could come, we could not have tempted him to part with them, as knowing very well if he were di&s;covered he &s;hould not only be ob|noxious to corporal puni&s;hment, but he and his generation &s;ent Slaves into <HI>Sibe|ria,</HI> where they might remain long enough before they returned.</P>
<P>Our Scaman and his two <HI>Borandine</HI> Camerades being departed, our Commi&s;s. and the two Sub-Commi&s;&s;es. fell in a drink|ing with him and our Guides. I and the two other Seamen took that opportunity and went to view the Town. We admired it exceedingly being &s;cituate betwixt two Mountains about a league high either of them. The Hou&s;es were built of Fi&s;h-bones very artificially, the Roofs of the &s;ame, but &s;topped in &s;ome places with Mo&s;s, and co|vered
<PB N="85" REF="48">with Flags of Earth, &s;o clo&s;e no wind could come in but at the doors (which are like the mouth of a Furnace) and a top the Hou&s;e where there is a hole or window left for light to come in.

Others making of Clothes of <HI>Bears</HI>-skin &s;owed together with thread made of the Rinde of Trees, with needles of the &s;mall bones of Fi&s;h, they were all of them ugly, little, flat nos'd, and &s;warthy as Devils.</P>

<P>BEing returned to our Company, our Commi&s;s. and Sub-Commi&s;s. upon Con&s;ultation re&s;olved to &s;end back one of our Guides with the Sledges and <HI>Elks,</HI> and to take the convenience of the water to pa&s;s to <HI>Potzora,</HI> which was accordingly performed. Our Landlord and two of his Servants in complement went along with us, and Coa&s;ting along the Shore by the favour of a We&s;terly wind, in fifteen hours we made <HI>Potzora,</HI> which is a &s;mall Town upon a little Sea called by that name; we repaired immediately to the Ca&s;tle to pay our re&s;pects to the Gover|nor, who in truth is no more than a Factor or Agent for the great <HI>Czar;</HI> all the Governors belonging to that Duke being no other in tho&s;e parts. There be|ing few of the nobility in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> which in my judgment is the rea&s;on they are &s;o rude and unpolli&s;hed, a thing incon&s;i&s;tent with the education of the nobles.</P>
<PB N="87" REF="49">
<P>The Governor was a <HI>Mu&s;covite,</HI> his ha|bit cloth betwixt a Violet colour and a Red, he treated us indifferent well, with Hydromets of an excellent &s;ort (not much unlike our Spani&s;h wine) &s;trong waters and &s;pice-bread. Having the charge of the <HI>Czars Magazines</HI> of <HI>Sables</HI> we ask'd him if he would deal with us for any, he told us he would, and demanding what we would buy, we replyed all he had, if we might have them at rea&s;onable Rates; whereupon he carryed us to his Ware-Hou&s;e, and &s;hew'd us five <HI>Zimmers</HI> (which are fifty pair) of which two <HI>Zimmers</HI> were the be&s;t I ever &s;aw, being naturally black as Jet, for which parcel we paid him 500 Ducates, which amount to three thou|&s;and <HI>French</HI> Livers, and for the other four hundred Ducates, which was as much as eight hundred <HI>French</HI>-Crowns.</P>
<P>Having paid him for what we had, and &s;een them marked with the Grand Dukes Seal, he would needs give us a treat, to which purpo&s;e he di&s;patched two Shallops to get fre&s;h-Fi&s;h, he killed a young <HI>Elk,</HI> and with &s;ome Foul his Servants had got abroad, he made us a magnificent Fea&s;t, both of Fle&s;h, Fi&s;h, and <HI>Mu&s;covian</HI> Bi&s;cuit. We &s;at eight hours compleat at the Table,
<PB N="88" REF="50">and by that time the fumes of the Hydro|met and Strong-Waters we had drank being got up into our Heads, we were glad to draw off to our <HI>Bears</HI>-skins which were all the beds we could get.</P>
<P>Having &s;lept &s;ix or &s;even hours, we got up, drank a Cup of Strong-Waters, and then went into the Town with a little Of|ficer the Governor &s;ent along with us, who carried us where we found two thou|&s;and <HI>Squirrel</HI>-Skins, four dozen of <HI>Ermins,</HI> five hundred <HI>Fox</HI>-skins (the mo&s;t of them as white as Snow, and the re&s;t black) <HI>&s;ix-Woolfs</HI>-skins, two hundred <HI>Martins,</HI> of a kind of an A&s;h-coloured-Grey, which co&s;t us (all of them) four hundred Ducates in Copper Mony (which troubled us to carry about) after which we returned to the Catle with our Merchandi&s;e, and packed them up in bails of Mats made of the Rinde of a Tree.</P>
<P>Having packed up our goods in this manner, we concluded to &s;end one of our Sub-Commi&s;&s;es with them to our Ships, to which end we intreated our Ho&s;t the Go|vernor to accommodate us with a Boat to convey them, which he readily granted, and two hours after our Officer departed with three <HI>Borandines</HI> the Governor lent
<PB N="89" REF="50">us, he having fir&s;t ingaged they &s;hould de|liver them &s;afe in our Ships, and that pay|ing him ten Ducats, and giving the men that carried them &s;ome &s;mall proportion of Tobacco, he would &s;atisfie the re&s;t at their return.</P>
<P>Our Sub-Commi&s;s. and his Camrades being gone, we fell a drinking pell-mell with our brace of Governors, and the Governor of <HI>Vitzora</HI> took of his Cups &s;o liberally, I could &s;carce imagine where he di&s;po&s;ed them. This debauch continued full four hours and then we went to our re&s;t.</P>

<P>We alighted from our Sledges, and went in to refre&s;h, and in the mean time five or &s;ix Men and Women with their Children returned from the Cha&s;e (which had been for tunate that day.

<P>Being got out of the River of <HI>Potzora</HI> about two hours, and following that which carried us to <HI>Papinogorod,</HI> we de|&s;cri'd coming out of a great Wood five men clad in <HI>Bears</HI> skin after the fa&s;hion of <HI>Mu&s;covia,</HI> each of them with a Gun up|on his Shoulder, his Bags by his &s;ide, and a &s;hort Sword in his hand like one of our Huntsmen, making toward us, we cau&s;ed our Sledges to &s;top, and our Guide to in|quire what people they were. One of them di&s;cerning we were &s;trangers, &s;aluted us in Dutch, gave us the time of the day, and wi&s;hed him&s;elf at as much liberty as we. Our Commi&s;s. (who was born in the lower <HI>Saxony</HI>) hearing him &s;peak Dutch, demanded his Country, to which the per&s;on replied, and our Commi&s;s. find|ing him of his aquaintance, alighted from his Sledge, took him in his Arms, and
<PB N="93" REF="52">having embraced, de&s;ired the occa&s;ion of his being there. The per&s;on replyed he was bani&s;hed thither by the great Duke for hunting of <HI>Sables,</HI> which is a puni&s;h|ment as ordinary in that Country, as &s;end|ing to the Gallies in <HI>France,</HI> &s;ome being bani&s;hed for ten years, &s;ome for &s;ix, others for three, more or le&s;s according to the quality of their offence, and after their time is expired, they have their li|berty and are free.</P>
<P>Their acquaintance, and my own curi|o&s;ity fetched me al&s;o out of my Sledge, and no &s;ooner had I &s;et foot upon the ground, but another of them came and embraced me, and then in the <HI>French</HI> Tongue with a &s;igh, asked me from whence I came, and whither I de&s;igned. I was much &s;urpri&s;ed, not knowing him in the lea&s;t by rea&s;on of his habit, his great beard, his bald pate, and the lean|ne&s;s of his body, being nothing but skin and bone; he perceived I was at a lo&s;s, and told me he was a Gentleman of <HI>Lorain</HI> Colonel of a Regiment of Hor&s;e for the Duke of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> had &s;een and treated me often at his hou&s;e in <HI>Stockholm,</HI> and had endeavoured to have per&s;waded me along with him to <HI>Mo&s;co.</HI> The fair equipage in

Our Commi&s;s. his friend told him the &s;ame, and the re&s;t (&s;peaking all of
<PB N="95" REF="53">them good <HI>French</HI> &amp; <HI>Dutch</HI>) confirmed it to be true; one of them had been a grand Commi&s;s. to the great Duke, another a Lievtenant General of all them per&s;ons of quality, who after a &s;ad relation of their &s;orrows, a&s;&s;ured us unanimou&s;ly that if it plea&s;ed God they outlived the time of their &s;entence, and were once again at liberty, they would never conti|nue in any Country under the power of the Grand Duke. To comfort them a|gain&s;t their calamities, we took out our Provi&s;ions, &s;ate down altogether upon the ground, and treated them as we could. We told them how glad we would be if we could be any ways in&s;trumental to their inlargment; for which they gave us thanks, but told us it was impo&s;&s;ible, in re&s;pect they were known to all the Go|vernors in tho&s;e parts thorow which of nece&s;&s;ity we mu&s;t pa&s;s, and that if they were taken with us they &s;hould be &s;ure to die by the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite tortures, and we unavoidably loo&s;e our lives into the bar|gain. This they remon&s;trated vvith &s;o much frankne&s;s and ingenuity, it redou|bled the grief vve had already conceived finding our &s;elves unable to relieve them in &s;o mi&s;erable an exigence. Having &s;taid
<PB N="96" REF="54">and conver&s;ed with them full four hours, we thought it time to take our leaves, and having pre&s;ented each of them with half a pound of Tobacco, after they had drank well of our Strong-Waters, and eaten of the Bi&s;cuit and &s;piced Bread we brought from <HI>Potzora,</HI> and &s;ome of our &s;alt meat, we bad them farewell, be&s;eeching God Almighty to give them power to over|come all they were to encounter, and ho|ping to &s;ee them again in their former &s;plendor and condition, we mounted our Sledges, and po&s;ted three full hours be|fore we di&s;covered a Hou&s;e; at length we perceived five or &s;ix, to them we went, and in them we found about a dozen per|&s;ons, we asked if they had any. Furs they would part with, they told us yes, and having &s;hewen us &s;everal we bought them, partly for ready mony and part for Strong Waters, of which tho&s;e people are very licquori&s;h.</P>
<P>We followed our journey by the dire|ction of the River, ob&s;erving Cabbins on both &s;ides of it, in &s;ome of them few, in others &s;everal People, of all of them we bought what we could get, &s;ometimes for Money, &s;ometimes for Strong-water, only their Sables they would not be tem|pted
<PB N="97" REF="54">to &s;ell, apprehending they &s;hould be found out by the Governour of <HI>Papinogo|rod</HI> (whither we were going) who fails not to &s;earch all Commodities that enter or pa&s;s out of the Town, lea&s;t any of tho&s;e Sables &s;hould be conveyed away by Stealth.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed the Mountains which part <HI>Boranday</HI> from <HI>Siberia,</HI> they are very un|plea&s;ant and trouble&s;om by rea&s;on of the wildne&s;s of the Country, uninhabitable both for the &s;terility of the Soil, Snows which are perpetually upon them, and the va&s;t quantity of Bears and White Wolfs which gave us no little fear during our Travels in tho&s;e parts, expecting to be &s;et upon by them every moment, but we perceived they were no le&s;s fearful of us, flying us upon all encounters, &s;ome this, &s;ome that way, and all in great Con&s;ternation, which we attributed much to the glittering of our Arms, by which we conceived they took us rather for Hunts-men then Merchants.</P>
<P>After much labour to our Elks, and tediou&s;ne&s;s to our &s;elves, after twelve hours fatigue we de&s;cended the Moun|tains, and came into a Village belonging to <HI>Siberia,</HI> who&s;e Inhabitants were all clad
<PB N="98" REF="55">in Bears-skin, the hair on the out&s;ide, but &s;ome linnen about them, and plated Boots, which made us believe them of better quality then their Neighbours which we had left. And indeed they re|ceived us more civilly enquiring who we were, whence we came, and whither we were bound. We Eat and Drank with them of &s;uch as we had, and they produced what their Town would afford, which was Bears-fle&s;h and Wolves Salted, with a &s;ort of Spice-bread, and <HI>aqua vitae:</HI> What Skins they had we bought with ready Money all but their Sables: and then having a de&s;ire to re&s;t our &s;elve; for &s;ome time, we entered into one of their hou&s;es (made after the <HI>Laponian</HI> fa&s;hion) and lay down upon Bears-skin about five or &s;ix hours, and then getting up again, we drank our Mornings draught together in <HI>aqua vitae,</HI> mounted our Sledges, and away for <HI>Papinogorod,</HI> where in about twenty hours time we arrived, having baited once or twice by the way to give our Cattel their nece&s;&s;ary repa&s;t upon the Mo&s;s.</P>

The way
<PB N="100" REF="56">of her &s;aluting us was by bowing of her Head, and then undoing the wri&s;t-band of her Smock on the right Arm, &s;he let it un|fold, and &s;lide down upon the ground, which our Commi&s;s.

<P>About eighteen hours we were upon the march, buying skins as we pa&s;&s;ed as far as the <HI>Riphean</HI> Mountains, which in our entrance into <HI>Samoije&s;ia,</HI> we cro&s;&s;ed in &s;ix hours more. <HI>Samoijefia</HI> is a de&s;ert Country, full of <HI>Juniper, Pine-Trees,</HI> and <HI>Firr;</HI> it abounds in <HI>Mo&s;s,</HI> in <HI>Snow, Woolfs, Bears, Foxes,</HI> all white, which we met every moment, and they gave us no little apprehen&s;ion.</P>

<P>HAving continued fifteen or &s;ixteen days at Anchor upon the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Zembla</HI> for the convenience of our &s;ick, all of them being recovered except &s;ome few, the weather coming fair, our Ma|&s;ters re&s;olved to weigh and &s;tand off to|wards <HI>Voygat</HI> in order to our Fi&s;hing for the <HI>Sea-Hor&s;e:</HI> accordingly we put about three Leagues to Sea, crui&s;ing up and down the Coa&s;ts at that di&s;tance, and &s;ending out our Shallops with their hooks and Hatchets, and eight men in each of them to &s;ee what they could catch.</P>
<P>Three days we were before we &s;aw any thing, at length we &s;aw two great Fi&s;hes (one of them with a Horn of a con&s;ide|rable length) which our Fi&s;hermen put them&s;elves into a po&s;ture to take, and be|ing got within a &s;tones ca&s;t of them, they threw out their Hooks, &s;ome on one &s;ide, &s;ome on the other with long lines fa&s;tned
<PB N="115" REF="63">to them for the purpo&s;e and then came back again with all &s;peed to our Ships.</P>
<P>Being got on Board our Ships, and per|ceiving the Fi&s;h &s;wimming above water (which is a &s;igne it was &s;pent) by little and little they drag'd it towards the Ve&s;|&s;el, which it &s;uffered without reluctance, the lo&s;s of blood having rendred it weak, and then falling to with our Axes, we cut of its head which we kept, but threw the body into the Sea, as being unfit ei|ther for Victual or Oyl. Our fi&s;hing for the <HI>Sea-Hor&s;e</HI> is only for its teeth, which is u&s;efull as Ivory for all kind of curio&s;ity, and &s;ells much dearer in re&s;pect of its whitene&s;s (which is far better of the two) and la&s;ts longer before it turns red.</P>
<P>The Horn of this <HI>Sea-hor&s;e,</HI> was full ten foot long, very heavy, wreathed like a Snail and as big as the bigge&s;t part of a mans Arm, tapering from the head to the point which was as &s;harp as a nee|dle.</P>
<P>One of our Shallops coming too near the other Fi&s;h before they threw out their Irons, finding her &s;elf &s;truck &s;he gave &s;uch a frisk with her Tail, that hitting the Boat, it turned it over, and before their Camrades could po&s;&s;ibly relieve them, two
<PB N="116" REF="64">of them were drowned, which troubled us much; how ever the Fi&s;h was taken and lo&s;t her head, as that we took had done before. I went to &s;ee it three or four hours after, found it had no Horn, but the want of that was well recompenced in her Teeth, which were much the fairer of the two.</P>
<P>Four days and nights we were crui&s;ing up and down after we had taken the&s;e two before we met with any more; and ju&s;t as we were removing to &s;ome other place, we di&s;covered four of the &s;ame &s;ort, in appearance much bigger than tho&s;e we had taken. Upon which we &s;lackned our Sail, let down our Shallops, with our Iron-mongers, and &s;uch other people as were nece&s;&s;ary for that imploy|ment, and in a &s;hort time they had catch|ed three of the four: the other e&s;caping, that our Fi&s;hermen brought on board our Ship had no Horn, nor indeed the other two. Ten or twelve hours after we &s;aw five more, we put down our people with their Irons, their Hooks and their Hatchets, and what el&s;e was nece&s;&s;ary for the purpo&s;e to try what they could do in our Shallops, e&s;pecially with one of them which we had ob&s;erved to have a horn:
<PB N="117" REF="64">but in &s;pight of all the diligence could be u&s;ed we could take but two; three of them got off, and that with the Horn was one of them. Some three hours after we perceived three more, of which our Officers catched one, who&s;e Head was &s;o big each of its great teeth weighed near thirty pounds.</P>
<P>Two days after we di&s;cerned &s;eaven or eight of them, and one with a Horn, we &s;et out all our Shallops immediate|ly, and were &s;o fortunate in the enter|prize, we took five of them, and that with the Horn was one of the number: it was brought to our Ship, but the Horn was neither &s;o heavy, &s;o big, nor &s;o long as the other.</P>

<P>Having Sailed above twelve hours to di&s;ingage our &s;elves from that &s;treight with the favour of an Ea&s;terly wind, and yet with great difficulty by rea&s;on of the ice, we came to a Anchor under a plea|&s;ant I&s;land, all delicatly green by the verdure of the <HI>Mo&s;s,</HI> the <HI>Fir</HI>-Trees, and the <HI>Juniper.</HI> Some of our Sea-men going a Shore, &s;aw a &s;ort of foul which could &s;carce fly for their fat, giving us an ac|count of it at their return, I was com|manded out (with forty more taken out of all our Ships) to go on &s;hore and try what we could catch of them, and indeed in no long time partly with our Guns, and partly with our Cudgels, we brought a|bout three&s;core of them along with us when we returned.</P>
<P>The&s;e Birds (which our Ma&s;ters told us were called <HI>Pingoins</HI>) are no higher than Swans, but much thicker; they are as white as they, their neck as long as Goo&s;es, their head bigger, with a red &s;parkling Eye a bout the breadth of a &s;hilling, the beak is yellowi&s;h and &s;harp, the feet broad and firm like a Goo&s;es. They have a kind of a pur&s;e about a foot long which begins under their beaks, and conti|nues all along their necks to the very
<PB N="121" REF="66">brea&s;t where it inlarges to &s;uch a de|gree it will hold a full Pottle. In this it is (when their bellies are full) they lay up their Cud, to have it ready again when their Stomacks require.</P>
<P>Before we could eat them we were forced to skin them, it being extream|ly hard, and the Feathers not to be pulled out of it but with very great difficulty. The Fle&s;h is good, has the &s;ame ta&s;t with a wild-Duck, is very fat, and made us very good Chear.</P>

<P>Their Ve&s;tments were of the skins of <HI>Pingoins</HI> with the Feathers upon them.

<P>Though they were both habited alike, we could di&s;cern one was a Man and the
<PB N="126" REF="69">other a Woman. The Man was about twenty years old, a broad Face like tho&s;e we had taken before, of a &s;warthy brown, his no&s;e big and flat, his eyes little and drawn towards his Temples without ei|ther Beard or Hair, his Quiver was full of Arrowes at his Back with a hatchet of Fi&s;h-Bones, which he carried upon his Shoulder with one hand, and his dart in the other.</P>
<P>The woman was about twenty years old, her hair in two breids hanging down upon her Shoulders, &s;he had blew &s;treaks all along her Chin, and three or four up|on her forehead, on her ears and under her No&s;e holes had been made, and blew &s;tones hanged in them in little Rings made of the &s;mal bones of Fi&s;h.

<P>We u&s;ed all the Artifice we could to have prevailed with them to &s;how us their quarters, but nothing would do, and we were forced to carry them on Board, where we put them to the other two we had taken in the <HI>Canoe:</HI> we could perceive they knew one another pre&s;ently, though their habit was different, the fir&s;t we

The elde&s;t was about fifty years old, with a round Che&s;t-nut coloured Beard, but no hair on his head. His Lady was about thirty, her Ears and no&s;e pierced (like other per&s;ons of her quality) and laden with blew &s;tones her Hair was platted in two Locks hang|ing upon her Shoulders, with blew &s;treaks upon her Chin and her Forehead, in &s;hort there was never a Barrel better Herring, one as rich and ill favoured as the other, both little trubs like the <HI>Samojedes, Lap|landers, Borandians,</HI> and <HI>Siberians,</HI> their voice was &s;hrill and &s;queaking their breath &s;tunk abominably, which we imputed to their Diet, eating their meat without Salt, or el&s;e dabbling their Fi&s;h in the Oyl of another &s;ort of Fi&s;h.

Having &s;truck it with their Irons, they draw it gently towards the Shore, and when it is dead, cut it all into Mamocks, for the fat, which they melt in great Kettles to draw out the Oyl, not far from certain Cabanes which the Fi&s;hermen build for that purpo&s;e upon the Coa&s;t.</P>
<P>This happened very luckily for our <HI>Zemblians,</HI> their Stomachs were almo&s;t lo&s;t for want of oyl, for two days together they had had none to dip their Fi&s;h in, becau&s;e it grew &s;carce in the Ship, and we were forc'd to abate their allowance of oyl with the Fi&s;h we gave them to eat.</P>

<P>Not many hours pa&s;&s;ed before we were overtaken by a &s;trong <HI>S. S: E.</HI> Wind, a violent Rain, and &s;uch dreadful claps of Thunder, we thought the World had been at an end.

<P>HAving put on Shore with our Ma&s;ter, our Commi&s;s. and others to the number of fifteen (part out of our Ve&s;&s;el, and part out of the re&s;t) we advanced to <HI>Hori,</HI> (which is a Town about a League and an half from the Sea) and from thence to <HI>Kirkebar</HI> (a little Town or a great Vil|lage which you will, in that I&s;land) we found in <HI>Kirkebar</HI> a Commi&s;s. and &s;even or eight Dani&s;h Merchants, who were ama|zed to &s;ee us there. They told us they were very glad to &s;ee us, and that the day before they had had &s;uch an Earth-quake they thought the whole I&s;land would have &s;unk into the Sea.

<P>Our Ma&s;ter, our Commi&s;s. and &s;ome others de&s;iring to &s;ee farther, and intima|ting it to the Commi&s;s. of <HI>Kirkebar,</HI> he cau&s;ed Hor&s;es to be got ready for them.

<P>The sky being &s;erene, and no flames to bee &s;een from the Mountain, we took a re&s;olution to go up to the top of it, but our Guides (to divert us) gave us to un|der&s;tand that if we pa&s;&s;ed any farther, we
<PB N="135" REF="73">&s;hould run a great hazard of &s;inking into holes the Fire had made, from whence there would be no po&s;&s;ibility to recover us upon which the whole company being di&s;|couraged, changed their minds and were returning as they came, but I told them if they would have patience, and &s;tay till I came back, I would venture alone, and give them an account; they promi&s;ed they would, and one of the Merchants we found at <HI>Kirkebar</HI> (who in curio&s;ity had come with us) undertook to bear me Company.</P>
<P>We pre&s;ently alighted, giving our Hor&s;es to our Guides (who &s;taid with the Gentlemen) and marched over the a&s;hes and Pumices (mid leg deep) towards the top, where we &s;aw a great quantity of Birds flying up and down as black as pitch, and they were Crowes and Vultures which build there.</P>
<P>Being got about half a League up the Hill, we found it begin to tremble under our feet, and heard a &s;trange cra&s;hing and rumbling within, which argued a hollow|ne&s;s, and gave us no little fear of &s;inking into it; at the &s;ame time round about us, on this &s;ide, and on that we perceived great chincks, out of which flames and

Being got about thirty pa|ces back, a cloud of A&s;hes brake &s;odain|ly out of the Mountain (&s;o big and thick it ob&s;cured the Sun) and fell upon us in &s;uch manner, we could not &s;ee one ano|ther, and that which frighted us the mo&s;t vvas to &s;ee every moment nevv gu&s;ts of Fire and A&s;hes break out fre&s;h and fall up|on us like hail, vvith a continued noi&s;e and rumbling under us, vvhich made us try out mo&s;t rufully as if all the infernal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">uries had de&s;igned to overvvhelm us, expecting every moment vvhen the Earth &s;hould open and &s;vvallovv us, to prevent vvhich vve made u&s;e of our heels, and ran dovvn again as fa&s;t as our legs could carry us, to avoid the danger into vvhich our cu|rio&s;ity had brought us.</P>

<P>After &s;ometime being come to our &s;elves we took each of us a Cup of Sack, which recovered our &s;ences, and then we depart|ed, coa&s;ting along about a hundred paces from the Mountain, towards two Foun|tains, one of them &s;o hot it perpetually boyled, the other &s;o cold it turned every thing put into it into &s;tone.</P>

<P>From the&s;e Fountains we pointed to|wards the Sea, and being come within half a League of it, we could hear a cer|tain noi&s;e as it were bemoaning and la|menting &s;ome di&s;a&s;ter, which our Guides

<P>Their manner of living (like the re&s;t of the Northern Countries) is very na|tural; their lodging is upon dryed hearbs with skins thrown over them, and one bed of that kind &s;erves the whole Fami|ly.</P>
<P>Their whole imployment is Fi&s;hing. They are very &s;lovenly, rude, bruiti&s;h, and mo&s;t of them Sorcerers, wor&s;hiping
<PB N="141" REF="76">the Divel (which they call <HI>Kobalde</HI>) who appears to them often in humane &s;hape: they have another Idol of wood, cut mo&s;t hideou&s;ly with a Knife, which they &s;how but &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ldome for &s;car it &s;hould be &s;tolen or demoli&s;hed by certain <HI>Lutheran</HI> Prie&s;ts which are there to in&s;truct them in the doctrine of Chri&s;tianity, and endeavor to re&s;cue them from the &s;lavery of Satan.</P>
<P>They have mo&s;t of them <HI>Trolles</HI> (as they call them) which are certain familiars at|tending and &s;erving them faithfully, giving them notice of any accident or di&s;temper impending; when they &s;leep the&s;e Fami|liars awake them to go a Fi&s;hing if the weather be fair, and if they go at any time without incouragement from them, they may &s;wear all the time and catch as much Fi&s;h.</P>
<P>They are &s;o exqui&s;ite in the art of Ma|gick, they will &s;hew &s;uch &s;trangers as are curious what is done in their hou&s;es in their own Countries; they will inform them Whether their Fathers, Mothers, Relations, or Friends (which they de&s;ire to be a&s;&s;ured of) be living or dead. They &s;ell Winds al&s;o to any body will buy them to go whither they plea&s;e.
<PB N="142" REF="77">The Commi&s;s. of <HI>Kirkebar</HI> (and others be&s;ide him) told me very gravely (as he had meant I &s;hould have believed him) that tho&s;e who are a Fi&s;hing at the Foot of Mount <HI>Hecla</HI> upon a day in which there happens a Battail in any part of <HI>Europe,</HI> do con&s;tantly &s;ee the Divels coming and go|ing into that Mountain with mens &s;ouls upon their backs, like Bees fetching and carrying Honey upon their Thighs.</P>
<P>If it falls out any of their friends are dead, and they are concerned to know what is become of them, applying them&s;elves to the&s;e Sorcerers, the defunct pre&s;ently ap|pears very melancholly and out of humour a&s;&s;ures them for certain he is dead, and with the Divel (who he mu&s;t confe&s;s is none of the be&s;t Ma&s;ters) de&s;ires them not to trouble them&s;elves any more for him, for he is &s;etled in <HI>Hecla,</HI> and till they come, to him can injoy them no more.</P>
<P>The Fields in I&s;land (though fair &amp; full of pa&s;turage) cannot produce wheat or any other grain proper for bread, in re&s;pect of the extream coldne&s;s of the place, by the means of a &s;harp <HI>North-Ea&s;t</HI> wind with which they are perpetually infe&s;ted.</P>

<P>THree days after we were arrived from our journy to <HI>Hecla</HI> to our Ships which was the 22th of <HI>September,</HI> a <HI>N:</HI> wind blowing favourable for us, we weigh|ed Anchor and departed, &s;teering our Cour&s;e <HI>S. S. E.</HI> Having &s;ail'd for &s;ome days indifferently well, on a &s;uddain we were &s;urpri&s;ed with a &s;mart Gale from the <HI>N. N. W.</HI> which drove us upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Norway,</HI> where (knowing the Pro|montories of <HI>Tal&s;o,</HI> which is a little Town upon an eminence with a very &s;trong Ca|&s;tle, about four Leagues from the Sea) we were overjoyed, as hoping ere long our Voyage would be at end. But we recko|ned without our Ho&s;t, for we had not been twelve hours upon the Coa&s;t, but the wind changed with the Moon, and forc'd us again to Sea, to avoid the Rocks, and
<PB N="144" REF="78">the danger of being driven back, nor in|deed could all the care and pains we could take prevent our running back above forty Leagues; after the Storm was over, we happened to be calmed which retard|ed us for &s;ome time; in the interim we perceived to the <HI>S. S. W.</HI> of us a great <HI>Seilon</HI> which affrighted our Seamen very much, and obliged them with all &s;peed to &s;lscken their Sails, and bring them to the Ma&s;ts, lea&s;t otherwi&s;e it &s;hould break up|on us, but it came not within two Leagues of us, at which di&s;tance we di&s;cerned it to fall. The&s;e <HI>Seilons</HI> are a kind of black thick Clouds in the fa&s;hion of Pillars, which are many times vi&s;ible at Sea, and if at any time they fall upon a Ship, it de&s;troys it by the abundance of water wherewith it fils it, and &s;inks it down right to the bottom, if it breaks perpen|dicularly over it. The Calm being gone, we were beholding to a <HI>N. E.</HI> wind, which in ten days time fini&s;hed our Voy|age, and brought us into <HI>Copen Hagen</HI> Road, where after we had &s;aluted the Ca&s;tle, we came to an Anchor, and put|ting out our long-Boats, got on &s;hore as &s;oon as we could.</P>
<P>We had &s;carce got into the Town, be|fore
<PB N="145" REF="78">his Maje&s;ty (having notice that we had brought three or four <HI>Zemblanes</HI> along with us) commanded us to Court, be|ing impatient to &s;ee them. We obeyed his command, and attended with them; as &s;oon as he &s;aw them he fell into great admiration, both of their habit, and &s;hape of their bodies. He gave order to the Governor of the Ca&s;tle to take them into his Care, to &s;ee they wanted nothing that was nece&s;&s;ary, and that they be taught the Language of his Country as well and conveniently as was po&s;&s;ible; af|ter which (having made us give him a rela|tion of the &s;everal Countries we had &s;een and of the manners and cu&s;tomes of the people) we were permitted to take our leaves, and to wait upon the Ma&s;ters of the Company to give them an accompt of our negotiations, with which they were very well &s;atisfied, and cau&s;ed our &s;hips to be brought to <HI>Chri&s;tian Haven</HI> (where their Store Hou&s;es are) to be unladen there.</P>
<P>One of the Principals of the Compa|ny was ordered by the re&s;t in all their Names to pre&s;ent his Maje&s;ty with the two Sea-Hor&s;es Horns which we brought home with us, which his Maje&s;ty received

<P>BEing upon the Subject of the <HI>&V;nicorn,</HI> who&s;e Horn is &s;o precious for the great Virtues which are attributed to it, I &s;hall &s;ay 'tis a very difficult thing to know what Creature the right Unicorn is, there being &s;everal Animals the Greeks call <HI>Monoceros,</HI> and the Latines <HI>&V;ni-Cornis;</HI> as among four footed Bea&s;ts, &s;everal <HI>A&s;&s;es</HI> wild <HI>Oxen,</HI> and the <HI>Bull</HI> in <HI>Florida.</HI> Among Serpents, there is the horned <HI>A&s;pic</HI> and the red <HI>Salamander.</HI> Among Fi&s;h the <HI>Pira&s;&s;ocpi,</HI> the Sea-<HI>Elephant,</HI> the

<P>Some will have this <HI>&V;nicorn</HI> to be a Land Creature, &s;ome a Water, and &s;ome an <HI>Amphibium,</HI> as living in both.</P>
<P><HI>Pliny</HI> &s;aies that the <HI>&V;nicorn</HI> is exactly like an <HI>Ox</HI> &s;potted with white, only the foot is firm and round as a <HI>Hor&s;es.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> will have it like a three-year-old-<HI>Colt,</HI> of a <HI>Wee&s;el</HI> colour, the head like a <HI>Stag,</HI> the legs &s;lender, and feet clo|ven, with his Horn in the middle of his Forehead, about two cubits in length.</P>
<P><HI>Marcus Paulus</HI> the <HI>Venetian</HI> affirms it to be like an <HI>Elephant,</HI> of the &s;ame &s;hape and colour, only a little le&s;s, and the Tail like an <HI>Oxes;</HI> the head like a <HI>Pigs,</HI> but &s;o weighty it hangs always towards the ground.</P>
<P><HI>Philo&s;tratus</HI> de&s;cribes it in the head like a Dragon, with a Horn (but of no great bigne&s;s) in the mid&s;t of it, wreathed like a Snail, it has a beard on its Chin: a long neck, feet like a <HI>Lion,</HI> the re&s;t of
<PB N="148" REF="80">its body like a <HI>Stag,</HI> and the skin like a <HI>Serpent.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He&s;iodorus</HI> repre&s;ents it &s;o &s;wift, it is not po&s;&s;ible to be taken by all the Art the Huntsman can u&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Lewis Paradis</HI> reports, that when any of themare taken, they feed them with <HI>Peas, Lintels</HI> and <HI>Beans.</HI> That they are as tall as <HI>Iri&s;h-Greyhounds,</HI> but not &s;o &s;lenderly made their hair of the colour of a <HI>Beaver</HI> very &s;mooth, the neck thin, the legs and feet and tail like a <HI>Hind,</HI> the head &s;hort and lean, the mouth like a <HI>Calf,</HI> the eyes large, the ears &s;mall and betwixt them a Horn very &s;lick, of a dark brown colour without, and about a foot in length.</P>
<P><HI>Thevetus;</HI> maintains the <HI>&V;nicorn</HI> to be as big as an <HI>Ox</HI> at &s;ix Months old, with legs and feet like an A&s;s, ear'd like a <HI>Rein</HI> Deer, and bears its Horn upon the top of its head.</P>
<P><HI>Lewis de Barthene</HI> will have it like a <HI>Bay-Hor&s;e,</HI> only the feet cloven, and a Horn in the middle of his forehead.</P>
<P><HI>Volne&s;ius</HI> affirms the <HI>Rhinoceros</HI> to be the right <HI>&V;nicorn, Garcius</HI> the <HI>Camphur,</HI> and <HI>John Corbichon</HI> the <HI>Egliceron</HI></P>
<P><HI>Albertus</HI> &s;aies the true <HI>&V;nicorns</HI> Horn is a hand and a half broad at the bottome,
<PB N="149" REF="80">and ten foot long. <HI>Lewis Barthenus</HI> will have it three fathom. <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> three Cubits. <HI>Marcus Paulus</HI> two, <HI>Lewis Paradis</HI> a foot and half. <HI>Nicholas</HI> the <HI>Venetian</HI> a a foot, and <HI>Cardan</HI> but three fingers long.</P>

<P>When I con&s;ider the di&s;crepancy in the opinions of all Authors about this <HI>&V;ni|corus horn,</HI> &s;ome de&s;cribing it one way, and &s;ome another, I am per&s;waded my &s;elf they have treated of it either out of Envy, or emulation to make them&s;elves admir'd, and the learned <HI>Baccius</HI> confirms that per&s;wa&s;ion, a&s;&s;erting that &s;uch Au|thors are not to be credited, as knowing nothing of that Creature but by hear-&s;ay, no body having ever &s;een it, any more than a <HI>Phenix.</HI></P>
<P>As to the virtue of this <HI>&V;nicorns horn</HI> &s;uppo&s;e it as is reported, and tho&s;e they would put upon us were right, I am a&s;|&s;ured it has no more than in the Horn of a &s;tag, <HI>Goat,</HI> or a piece of <HI>Ivory,</HI> which is many times u&s;ed to &s;top the &s;pitting of blood, Emrades, and loo&s;ne&s;s, which
<PB N="150" REF="81">they cure by a re&s;tringent virtue (or rather a convenient malignity) that re&s;tringen|cy cau&s;ed by the Earthine&s;s of their &s;ub|&s;tance) &s;topping and choking up the pa&s;|&s;age in the Veins and Arteries, becomes rather a poi&s;on than a Cordial, like the &s;tone of a certain Coun&s;ellors Clerk made up of <HI>Sulfure</HI> and <HI>Vitriol,</HI> which ca&s;t into twenty Buckets of River water gave it a tincture and quality proper as he pretend|ed for all kinds of di&s;ea&s;es; as many Moun|tebanks do now with their powders of precious &s;tones, Pearls, and Gold, which they cry up for great Antidores, whereas all experienced Phy&s;itians do know they are but cheats and if they give ea&s;e at any time 'tis more by the virtue of the thing in which it is given, than any propriety of its own; and the rea&s;on they give is be|cau&s;e nothing that is incapable of recei|ving nouri&s;hment, can be capable of gi|ving it, as pearl, pretious &s;tones, and Gold; which if indued with any nutri|tive faculty, rich men would never die of hunger as long as they la&s;ted, nor any Famine happen to them, as it did in the Siege of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> forty years after the death of our Saviour, as <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> affirms in his Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Jews,</HI> quite contra|ry

<P>And as a further evidence that the horn of an <HI>&V;nicorn</HI> has no virtue in it, and there|fore is no Cordial, it has neither ta&s;t nor &s;mell more than a bone, and by con&s;e|quence no more virtue.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XLVI.</HI> The Authors reflections upon an Error in our <HI>Geographers</HI> in the placing of <HI>Greenland</HI> and <HI>Zembla,</HI> with Ob&s;ervations upon &s;uch as have writ about <HI>Voygat,</HI> and the <HI>Samojedes.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AT my return from tho&s;e Northern Countries, there having fallen into my hands &s;everal Geografical Charts, of &s;undry eminent and much celebrated Au|thors, I was amazed to &s;ee how as it were unanimou&s;ly) they were mi&s;taken in the
<PB N="152" REF="82">po&s;ition of <HI>Zembla,</HI> which they place much nearer the North Pole, than really it is, and <HI>N. E.</HI> of <HI>Laponia</HI> though in|deed it is more inclining to the North. They divide it likewi&s;e by the Sea from <HI>Greenland,</HI> and put it at above twelve hundred Leagues di&s;tance from it, when as indeed tho&s;e two Countries are conti|guous, the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Greenland</HI> butting upon the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Zembla,</HI> &s;o as did not the great quantity of Snow, and the violence of the Cold render tho&s;e borders uninhabitable, the pa&s;&s;age would be very ea&s;ie by Land from <HI>Greenland</HI> to <HI>Zembla,</HI> and from <HI>Zembla</HI> (pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Pateno&s;tres</HI> Mountains) to enter into <HI>Samo&s;e&s;pia;</HI> from thence into <HI>Tartary,</HI> or <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> as one pleas'd.</P>
<P>I was amazed likewi&s;e to &s;ee they had de&s;crib'd the <HI>Strait</HI> called <HI>Voygat</HI> not above ten French Leagues in length wheras it con|tains above five &amp; thirty Dutch Leagues, which is &s;ix times as much; again they would per&s;wade us that thorow that &s;trait our Ships might pa&s;s into the great <HI>Tar|tarian</HI> Ocean, which is a a mi&s;take, though they indeed do affirm that in the time of Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> of <HI>Na&s;&s;au</HI> a Dutch Ve&s;&s;el pa&s;&s;ed that way into that Ocean, but it
<PB N="153" REF="82">is a manife&s;t errour, that &s;trait being bounded (as I &s;aid before) by the <HI>Pateno&s;tres</HI> Mountains, the lea&s;t of which is above halfe a League high, and the tops of them&punc; covered with perpetual Snow which never di&s;&s;loves. And of this I can give a po&s;itive Te&s;timony having been my &s;elf in that &s;trait, under tho&s;e Mountains in the dog-days (which is the hotte&s;t time in the year) and found it very cold, the winter continuing all the year in tho&s;e parts, as the Summer does about the <HI>Magellan</HI> Straits near the <HI>Antartick</HI> Pole.</P>
<P>As the Countries remote towards the <HI>South,</HI> are called <HI>incognitae:</HI> &s;o the Coun|tries in the &s;ame di&s;tance, might have the &s;ame appellation; yet though to us they are unknown at pre&s;ent, I do not que&s;tion but if we had occa&s;ion to go farther, we &s;hould di&s;cover Countries well peopled and inhabited, which we might call new Worlds, according to the example of <HI>Chri&s;topher Columbus, Magellan,</HI> and others who have called their di&s;coveries by that Title, following therein &s;entiments of <HI>De|mocritus Epienrus</HI> and <HI>Metrodorus,</HI> who maintain there are &s;everal Worlds, con|trary to the Doctrine of <HI>Hermes Tri&s;me|gi&s;tus</HI>
<PB N="152" REF="83">and <HI>Plato,</HI> who affirm there is but one which God created according to his own plea&s;ure, of which no man can give an account, either of its end, beginning, height, depth, or middle: though our <HI>Geographers</HI> tell us other things in their <HI>Plani&s;phers,</HI> propo&s;ing the <HI>Artick</HI> Pole for the Top, the <HI>Antartick</HI> for the bottom, and the <HI>Equator</HI> for the mid|dle. To which <HI>Strabo</HI> di&s;&s;ents, a&s;&s;erting the middle of the World to be the Moun|tains <HI>Parna&s;&s;us</HI> in <HI>Greece.

<P>I would fain know of our <HI>Geographers</HI> where they place the old <HI>Zembla;</HI> I am of opinion if they had been in the new, they would confe&s;s there was no other. That New <HI>Holland, We&s;t-Friezeland,</HI> and <HI>Cape d'Hyver</HI> are in the Straits of <HI>Voygat,</HI> and not on the other &s;ide in the great <HI>Tartarean</HI> Ocean as they have placed them. And he (that in his relation of the State of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> &s;peaks of the <HI>Samojedes</HI>) if he had been among them, and had any con|ver&s;ation there, would not have de&s;crib'd them eaters of &s;trangers, and that the Grand Duke &s;ent his <HI>Criminals</HI> thither, to be devoured by them which is utterly fal&s;e;
<PB N="153" REF="83">Though their Bodies are ill favoured, and their wit dull, though they have no knowledge of God, nor fear of torment in the other World; (believing their &s;ouls and bodies die together) though they &s;eem the mi&s;erable&s;t people of the Earth, living in Summer upon <HI>Bears, Woolfs, Foxes, Crowes, Eagles,</HI> and other wild Creatures which they hunt fir&s;t and then eat in their <HI>Cabanes</HI> broild upon the Coals, and &s;ub&s;i&s;t in the Winter upon nothing but Fi&s;h dried in the Sun in the Summer time, unle&s;s by accident they kill &s;ome of tho&s;e Bears, who (having nothing left by the Snow in the fields) come home to their Cabanes to devour them.
