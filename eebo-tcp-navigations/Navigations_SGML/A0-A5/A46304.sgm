<HEAD>A JOURNAL Of all that happen'd in the MARCH of the VAUDOIS Till their Arrival in the Valleys of St. <HI>Martin</HI> and <HI>Lu&s;ern;</HI> Written from <HI>Lau&s;anne</HI> the 19th. of <HI>September</HI> 1689. to an Eminent Merchant in <HI>London,</HI> with the Number of tho&s;e that pa&s;s'd the Lake to joyn them.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">LICENS'D <HI>September</HI> 27th. 1689. <HI>J. F.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Vaudois</HI> to the number which I mention'd in the la&s;t that I &s;ent you, &s;et forward from this City about fifteen days &s;ince; with a Re&s;olution to go into the Valleys of <HI>Piemont,</HI> di&s;tant from hence about five and thirty Leagues. I was one of tho&s;e that de&s;ir'd one of the Magi&s;trates of this place, to let them have the conveniency of Boats, for that Mon&s;ieur the Bailiff had forbid the people here to fur|ni&s;h them with any, tho' under hand he was willing enough they &s;hould have them, as being one that wi&s;h'd well to the common Cau&s;e, however he is forced to ob&s;erve &s;ome little mea&s;ures and punctillio's by rea&s;on of the Neutrality: But at length I engag'd Mon&s;ieur <HI>le Bour&s;ie</HI> one of the Judges to go to the Fort at two of the Clock at Night, whither I accompanied him, and obtain'd permi&s;&s;ion, that the <HI>Vaudois</HI> might be fur|ni&s;hd with Boats: We al&s;o a&s;&s;i&s;ted them with all &s;uch other nece&s;&s;aries as lay in our power. They had an extraordinory good pa&s;&s;age over the Lake; and as they march'd forward, they &s;eiz'd upon the Prie&s;ts and Lords of the Villages through which they pa&s;s'd. But finding by that time they had gone two days march, that there was a Bridge broken down to impede their pa&s;&s;ing farther; they threatened their Pri&s;oners to put them to death, if they did not take care to have the Bridge repair'd; &s;o that the Country people that liv'd on the other &s;ide were forc'd to repair the Bridge, which the <HI>Vaudois</HI> pa&s;s'd in good Order.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> having intelligence of their March, rais'd the Militia of his own Country, and &s;ent away a Courier to the Marque&s;s <HI>de Larre</HI> Collonel of Dragoons, and Commander of the Forces in the Dauphinate, to &s;top the farther progre&s;s of the <HI>Vaudois,</HI> who were then upon the Frontiers. Thither therefore he ha&s;ten'd with four Troops of Dragoons, whom he caus'd to break down a Bridge, and Entrench'd the Militia of <HI>Savoy</HI> in the &s;ame place to di&s;pute the pa&s;&s;age. But the <HI>Vaudois</HI> upon the fir&s;t di&s;charge which they made, kill'd the Commander of the Savoyards, who was a Marqui&s;s al&s;o, with &s;everal others, which put the re&s;t into &s;uch a Terrour that they abandon'd the Pa&s;s. Here the <HI>Vaudois</HI> lo&s;t a Mini&s;ter and four Souldiers, whom the Enemy carried bound to <HI>Chamberg,</HI> and there hang'd them up.</P>
<P>Afterwards Mon&s;ieur <HI>Larre</HI> meeting them with four Troops of Dragoons, ask'd them whither they were going; they An&s;wer'd they were going to their own homes; by who&s;e Order? To whom? Their Mini&s;ter Mr. <HI>Arnauld</HI> who has appear'd all along at the Head of them; Replied, by Order of the <HI>King of</HI> England, William <HI>the Third.</HI> Upon which the Commander told 'em, that they were a Company of Vagabond Ra&s;|cals, and that he would trample them to death under his Hor&s;es Feet, and &s;o Com|manded his Dragoons to ride up to them, which Mr. <HI>Arnauld</HI> &s;eeing, prepar'd his peo|ple
<PB REF="2">to receive them accordingly, which they did; and after a Fight that la&s;ted two Hours, they won the Victory, having kill'd a hundred and fifty of the Dragoons, and two Captains, befides &s;ive or &s;ix more Inferiour Officers kill'd and wounded; and Mr. <HI>de Larr&eacute;</HI> wounded in the Elbow of which he is &s;ince dead: Of the <HI>Vaudois</HI> not above fifteen or twenty kill'd and wounded.</P>
<P>Thus they enter'd into the Valleys of of <HI>Pregolas</HI> which are under the Dominion of <HI>France,</HI> where about two hundred of the Inhabitants of the &s;aid Valleys joyn'd them. In their March they pillag'd the Abby of <HI>Ouls</HI> in the French Territory; where they found 180000 Livres, or 15000 <HI>l.</HI> Engli&s;h, and twenty four Monks, whom they carried along with them as Ho&s;tages. They al&s;o took upon the Moun|tains above twenty Thou&s;and Sheep. At the &s;ame time they met the Baggage be|longing to the Popes Nuncio, returning from <HI>Paris</HI> to <HI>Rome.</HI> They open'd the Packs, and took out all the Plate, but meddl'd with nothing el&s;e; but be&s;ides all this Booty, they found the Valleys of St. <HI>Martins</HI> and <HI>Lu&s;ern,</HI> where they are now Arriv'd, well &s;tor'd with Corn, which makes us believe they will find it a difficult thing to make them di&s;lodge from thence, having expell'd the <HI>Savoyards</HI> that liv'd in the Vale to the very tops of all the Mountains. All <HI>Savoy</HI> is in Arms, to prevent tho&s;e that have taken Sanctuary in <HI>Switzerland,</HI> from going to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, as it is believ'd they will do; the <HI>Switzers</HI> not at all oppo&s;ing the Levies which they make in tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> has Written a very &s;evere Letter to the <HI>Switzers</HI> upon this oc|ca&s;ion, which they have taken very ill, no le&s;s offended that he had broken his word with them, in not re&s;toring to them the Mini&s;ters and Children of the <HI>Vandois.</HI> The Canton of <HI>Oury,</HI> which is a popi&s;h Canton, has deliver'd up a hundred and five of tho&s;e poor people to the Emba&s;&s;ador of <HI>Savoy,</HI> after they had robb'd them of all their Cloaths and mony, and put four of them to the Rack, to make them di&s;cover the de|&s;igns of the re&s;t of their Brethren, but they would not confe&s;s any thing. The Em|ba&s;&s;ador has caus'd them to be tied two and two together, and &s;ent them away into <HI>Savoy,</HI> for fear that the Lords of <HI>Zurie</HI> and of <HI>Berne</HI> &s;hould redemand them, which they did; to whom the popi&s;h Cantons return'd for An&s;wer, that they had de|liver'd them up already, but with this condition, that no harm &s;hould be done them; which very much di&s;pleas'd the Lords of <HI>Zurie</HI> and <HI>Berne;</HI> in&s;omuch that it proved the occa&s;ion of a Rupture between them.</P>
<P>There are already departed above 1500 Men to joyn tho&s;e that are March'd before; in order to which they have pa&s;s'd the Lake, and two Thou&s;and more are ready to Embark, with a re&s;olution to follow them. They are all French that fled for Refuge, except four hundred <HI>Vaudois,</HI> who came hither as &s;oon as they under&s;tood the depar|ture of the re&s;t, And had not Mounfieur the Bailiff forbid the Switzers, upon pain of death, not to &s;tir out of the State, there would have gone above two thou&s;and. How|ever this has not hindred a very con&s;iderable number from going, finding the <HI>Vaudois</HI> &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful in their Enterprizes.</P>
<P>It is hoped, that the King of <HI>England</HI> will prevail with the King of <HI>Spain</HI> to declare war again&s;t the Duke of <HI>Savoy;</HI> to the end the <HI>Milainois</HI> Governors may be ordered to furni&s;h them with all &s;uch nece&s;&s;aries which they &s;hall &s;tand in need of. For other|wi&s;e, it will be a difficult thing for the&s;e poor people to pre&s;erve what they have got. The King of <HI>France</HI> having order'd the forces of of the <HI>Dauphinate</HI> to march, to expel them from tho&s;e places where a little A&s;&s;i&s;tance would defend them from all the force of their Enemies. The Emba&s;&s;ador of <HI>France</HI> at <HI>Geneva</HI> makes a great noi&s;e and &s;peaks loud upon this occa&s;ion. We expect with impatience the re&s;ult of the Con&s;ultations of the <HI>A&s;&s;embly</HI> at <HI>Baden. Savoy</HI> is all in Arms, and the people are &s;trangely alarm'd, at &s;o many Commotions. The French Troops are quartered round about <HI>Geneva:</HI> How|ever as yet all things are quiet: In expectation of more News I remain, <HI>YO&V;RS,</HI> &amp;c</P>
<P>We thought it not from the purpo&s;e to gratifie the Curiofity of the Reader to add this Century of <HI>No&s;tre Damus</HI> in regard it agrees &s;o well and falls out &s;o pat to the Con|dition of <HI>France</HI> at this time.</P>
