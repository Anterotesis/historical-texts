<HEAD>TO THE READER</HEAD>
<P>_THe reasons be manifold (good rea|der) that mooued me to publish thys present Tale. First, that I might (in what I was able) illustrate or make better known to y^e world, my countrie or place of byrth: to which (as <HI>Cicero</HI> saith) each man doth ow the third part of his life, &amp; for which ther is no good man, but wil ieopard his life, aduenture his safetie, and hazard the dearest things hee dooth possesse: neither yet was there euer any man so brutish, but reioyceth to heare his countrie commended, and is deligh|ted when he heareth the same wel spoken off and praised: such is the affection that euery man beareth to it: that <HI>Ouid</HI> expres|sing the same, said, he coulde not tel howe it came to passe, nor whence it should proceede. His words be these:
<Q><L>Nescio qua natale solum dulcedine cunctos</L>
<L>Ducit, nec</L></Q>
Hence it came to passe that antiquity gaue diuine honor to such as had deserued wel of their countrie: either in peace, by inuen|ting something to the profit or wealth thereof: or in war, by ad|uentring their bodies in defence thereof.</P>
<P>Another reason was, that albeit neither my writing, nor other indeuour whatsoeuer, be able to perfourm any thing that might either beautifie or adorne the places I speake of: Yet hereby I would animate, or encourage those worthy Poets, who haue writte~ <HI>Epithalamion Thamesis,</HI> to publish the same: I haue seen it in Latene verse (in my iudgment) wel done, but the Author I know not for what reason doth suppresse it: That which is written in English, though long since it was promised, yet is it not perfourmed: so as it seemeth, some vnhappy Star enuieth y^e sight of so good a work: which once set abroad, such trifles as these would vanish, and be ouershadowed, much like the Moon and other starres, which after the appearing of the Sunne are not to be seene at all.</P>
<P>Thirdly, being fully resolued to leaue my country, I held best before my departure <HI>Cigneum aliquid canere:</HI> not vnlike the
<PB REF="3" MS="y">
Swans, who before their death do sing as <HI>Ouid, Uirgil, Mar|tial, Horace</HI> with all the poets do constantly affyrme. The Phi|losophers say, it is because of the spirit labouring to passe tho|row the long and small passage of her necke, makes a noise as if she did sing. <HI>Pithagoras</HI> did thinke their soules were immortal, and saith, how before their death, they reioice and sing as going to a better life. The maner of their singing M. <HI>Thomas Watson</HI> in his <HI>Odes</HI> expresseth thus:
<Q><L>Qualis vbi longo moerore Castrius ales confectus senio graui. &amp;c.</L></Q>
Which verses <HI>A. F.</HI> hath englished on this wise.</P>
<Q><L>Like to the siluer Swan, who seeing death to be comming,</L>
<L>Wandreth alone for a while through streams of louely Caister:</L>
<L>Then to the flowring bankes all faint at last he repairth,</L>
<L>Singing there sweet bird, his dieng song to Caister:</L>
<L>Geuing there sweete bird, his last farewell to Caister:</L>
<L>Yeelding vp, sweet bird, his breath and song to Caister.</L></Q>
<P>The last, and not the least motiue was my friendes request, whose importunate demaund without breach of amitie, I could not gainsay: to whom, as also to thy fauourable construction (curtcous and friendly reader) I commit the same.</P>

And since that, at that time I promised to send you in a letter a plaine and eui|dent prooffe of those words which there I vttered, I doubt not but in these few lines fully to satisfie, not only your request, but also your mind, and confirme you in that opinion which fewe men (vnlesse such as be altogether ignorant of the matter, and of the place) wil denie. And for so much as the cause for which the ships went thether, and what they did there, then will I plainly prooue both by auchoritie and examples, that it is like|y that they were ther.

The Danes perceiuing that, and seeing there was nothing left whereof they might liue in those partes, departed from thence, and in great has<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e got them to north Wales, where they spoyled and hartied the countrie farre and neere, driuing away great booties of Cartel, and carrieng with them rich spoiles. From hence they departed And because for feare of the Mercians they durst not traueile that way, they coasted along the countrie till they came to Nor|thumberland, and so through middle England, taking the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> shippes their w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ues &amp; children out of cast England with them, they arriued at a little Island sc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">uate in the Sea, in the east part of Essex called <HI>Merseyge.</HI> From thence they departed and came into the riuer of <HI>Thames,</HI> and seeing that Winter was now at hand, they drew or rowed their shippes vp the riuer <HI>Lygean.</HI> And twentie miles from <HI>London</HI> they began to buylde a Fort, which being finished, they taried there all that wynter, spoyling, robbing and burning those quarters without mercy. When Winter was past, a great part of the Citizens of Lon|don, with those that inhabited neere thereaboutes traueiled thether, and by force minded to breake downe the Fort or mu|nition which they had there buylded. But the Danes stoutlye resisted them, and not far from the place gaue them a sharpe battaile, where the Christians were put to flight, and foure of King <HI>Alfreds</HI> men were slaine.</P>
<P><PB REF="12" MS="y">
Thus the pagane or heathen Danes remained Lordes or maisters of those quarters, compelling the husbandmen to eare and till the ground, meaning themselues to reape the commo|ditie of it. But the good King <HI>Alfred,</HI> who alwaies was care|full for the welfare of his subiectes, gathered an armie, and be|fore haruest time pitched his tents neer to the place of their a|bode. By whose comming, the enemies were so affraid, that they durst not once peepe out of their hold to fetch either cattell or corne out of the fields by force. In this space, it happened on a time, as the King rode alongst by the riuer side, he viewed the water, and perceiued how that in some places of it, the cha|nell might easily bee stopped, and the streame made lesse. Whereupon he (as <HI>Huntington</HI> writeth) caused it to bee cut in|to three seuerall braunches or armes: but howsoeuer it was, hee so weakened the streame, that the Danes could not bring back their ships the same way they came. Which thing the Danes perceiuing, and knowing well it was in vaine for them to abide any longer there, they left their Shippes, and fled by land as fast as they could to <HI>Quatbridge,</HI> sending their wiues and chil|dren againe into east England. After this the king departed, and the Londoners and Countrimen seeing the Danes were gone, burst downe their Holde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">, and got some of their ships backe againe to <HI>London,</HI> and the rest they burned and brake all to peeces.</P>
<P>But here peraduenture you will aske me, howe I shoulde come by the knowledge of these thinges, beeing done so many hundred yeares agoe. To this I answere, that in things that were done long before any man that is now liuing can remem|ber, wee must credit that our Fathers haue committed to wri|ting concerning the same. And in my opinion, the neerer the re|porter liueth to those times in which the thinges he speaketh or writeth of were done, the more credite is to bee geuen to him.</P>
<P>And as concerning this matter, it is confirmed by the reporte of a verie auncient, reuerent and and learned Wry|ter, namely <HI>Asserus Meneuensis,</HI> Bishop of Saint <HI>Da|uies,</HI> that liued in the verie selfe same time when these thinges
<PB REF="12" MS="y">
were done, and <HI>Maryanus Scotus</HI> who liued and wrote a chro|nicle at least 500. yeares ago, as <HI>Florentinus</HI> a Monk of Wor|cester, who continued it, doth witnesse and declare. Besides di|uers others of great antiquitie and credite as <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Hun|tington, Mathew</HI> of <HI>Westminster,</HI> and manie moe, who d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e all confirme that which is before declared. Besides there remay|neth yet the ruines of an old Castle or Fort betweene <HI>Hartford</HI> Castle and the Mill, which I doe vndoubtedly beleeue was the verie selfe same Fort that the <HI>Danes</HI> builded.</P>
<P>Moreouer, <HI>O. Crosse</HI> did credibly en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">rine me that at y^e buil|ding of <HI>Stansted</HI> bridge, there were found within the riuer, pee|ces of broken ships or Craets, nayles and other thinges which seemed to belong to some great shippes or vessels. All which thinges considered, together with the parting of the streame before remembred, me thinkes should be sufficient to confirme your minde, and cause you to beleeue that there haue bene ships at <HI>Ware</HI> and <HI>Hartford.</HI></P>
<P>Hereunto may bee added that it was a common vse of the <HI>Danes</HI> to row or drawe vp their ships into some smaller creeke or riuer where that they might ride all winter with least dan|ger. And time worketh some alteration both by water and by land, y^t where great riuers did somtimes run, nowe it is vtterlie drie, and in stead of maine waters we haue goodly &amp; florishing Meades. And in like sort, where goodly cities and castels some times did stand, there now groweth corne. For examples of this we need not seeke farre, since y^t in <HI>London</HI> not aboue 277. yeeres ago namely in the yeere of our Lord 1300. when <HI>Henry Waleys</HI> was Mayor of the citie there ran a riuer through Walbrook w^t two bridges ouer it, whereof <HI>William Iordan</HI> and <HI>Iohn de Be|uer</HI> were maisters and gouernours. What is become of the ri|uer <HI>Wer.</HI> that ran by S. <HI>Albons</HI> of which the great city that in old time stood there, took the name and was called <HI>Werlamche|ster,</HI> whereof <HI>Leland</HI> in his co~mentaries maketh mention, con|cerning cities the diligent reader of chronicles shal meet with y^e names of many, of which ther is at this day no rubbish nor ruin to be seen, as <HI>Andres Chester&punc;</HI> y^t stood in Sussex on y^e edge of the great wood called <HI>Andreds weale</HI> of <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">hancester,</HI> y^t stood in the
