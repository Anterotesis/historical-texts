<HEAD><HI>A DIALOGUE</HI> Between Two Members of the New and Old <HI>EAST-INDIA</HI> Companies.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old. Memb.</SPEAKER>
<P>SIR, We are now in a fair way to be upon equal Terms with You, if our Bill of In|coporation pa&s;&s;es, which I make no doubt of</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>New.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, if that Bill &s;hould pa&s;s, I mu&s;t allow you'l have an Act of Parliament upon much ea|&s;ier Terms than we had. But, Sir, I do make a doubt upon that which you &s;eem to be &s;o po&s;itive in, and my Rea&s;on is from the Ju&s;tice, and the Nature of the thing it &s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, is there not as much Rea&s;on and Ju&s;tice we &s;hould be E&s;tabli&s;h'd by Parliament as you could pretend to?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>New.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really, Sir, I think not, for you may remember the occa&s;ion; 'Twas the continual Com|plaints of the Irregularities and Abu&s;es by your Company which was the &s;ole Rea&s;on for Erecting a New one; In&s;tance, how the Kingdom in general was offended with your Ma|nagement, and thought it highly rea&s;onable to give you early Notice of your being di&s;&s;ol|ved. 'Twas this, Sir, that drove the Nation under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ettling the Trade in other hands. Be&s;ides, Sir, 'twas not &s;o fair a Practice in you (when the Government propo&s;ed to Rai&s;e Two Millions upon the E&s;tabli&s;hment of that Trade) to make Offers to advance the whole Sume, and when it came to the Pinch Nothing to be done: But on the contrary you &s;ee the Members of the New Company was &s;o far from he&s;itating, or trifling with the King's Bu&s;ine&s;s (when we were under &s;uch Straights and Difficulties) that as one Man they all Embark'd in the Intere&s;t of the Government, and compleated the whole without any Ob&s;truction. Do you make, Sir, no Difference between the New and the Old? And pray, Sir, let me enlarge a little farther, by asking you one Que&s;tion more. Suppo&s;e that you had Advanced the Two Millions for the Service of the Government, and thereby had been confirm'd by Parliament, &s;hould you not have thought your Selves &s;ecured from the dan|ger of any other Act, to Erect a New Company in a Year or two afterwards to Trade to the &s;ame Place, with very near the &s;ame Privileges? An&s;wer me fairly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old.</SPEAKER>
<P>To &s;peak the Truth, I &s;hould have thought our &s;elves very &s;ecure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>New.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then where's the Ju&s;tice in your Endeavours to Obtain an Act in Prejudice of others, which you would have con&s;tru'd to be very hard, if in the &s;ame Ca&s;e it had been done to your Selves?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, Ours is an Extraordinary Ca&s;e, and if you will but con&s;ider the whole, that is to &s;ay, The many Lo&s;&s;es we have &s;u&s;tain'd by Sea of late Years; the Taxes we have paid du|ring the War, and the Di&s;couragement we have been under for &s;ome time, I am of Opi|nion you will not think it unrea&s;onable for us to have an Act of E&s;tabli&s;hment as well as you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>New.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I mu&s;t confe&s;s that you have met with great Lo&s;&s;es, and been under great Difficulties and Di&s;appointments, the&s;e are Motives to &s;ome &s;ort of Compa&s;&s;ion; but excu&s;e me, Sir, if I think you are not altogether Meritorious of &s;uch a Recompence as you &s;eem to aim at: And further, pray give me leave to &s;et the Hare's head again&s;t the Goo&s;e Gibblets; Sir, as you have had great Lo&s;&s;es, &s;o you mu&s;t have had Extravagant Profits, or you could never have made &s;uch large Dividends, nor have been Ma&s;ters of &s;o great E&s;tates.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Well, for all this I doubt not but the Bill will pa&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>New.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, As I &s;aid before, I do doubt it, and upon good grounds too, Plea&s;e to Ob&s;erve my Rea&s;ons: In the fir&s;t place, by the&s;e means we &s;hall greatly Le&s;&s;en the Credit of the Nation; for, by the &s;ame Rule that this Act pa&s;&s;es, we may rea&s;onably expect to have another Company &s;et up in a Year or two's time; &s;o con&s;equently no dependance to build a Trade upon any thing. The People will grow weary, and not plea&s;ed with what they have tru&s;ted; give Credit to Nothing; the Government will be brought into &s;uch a Con|dition, that when ever they are in want of Money, they mu&s;t Infallibly meet with Di&s;ap|pointments. Sir, the Credit of the Nation mu&s;t be kept Sacred; or el&s;e it can be of no
<PB REF="2">Force; be&s;ides, Sir, Pray what has the New Company done to fall under any di&s;couragement; when they advanced their Money, no doubt but they relied upon the Sanction of their Act Parliament, and till &s;uch time as they become Criminals to the State, or a Grievance to the People, or prove di&s;tructive to the Trade of <HI>England</HI> in General, I think they have all the Rea&s;on in Honour for the Nation, and in Ju&s;tice for them&s;elves, to expect their Rights to be pre&s;erved, and not in the lea&s;t to be Infringed upon. A Man might make a Reply how long it is &s;ince your Company made Re&s;titutions for your pa&s;t Crimes; or what is it that you have done lately to repre&s;ent your&s;elves wor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">hy of &s;uch a Boon from the Go|vernment, even to the prejudice of it &s;elf. Methinks the Cau&s;e be&s;peaks it &s;elf: But, how|ever, I have another Rea&s;on to differ in Opinion from you, that is, that Two Companies are incon&s;i&s;tent, and will ever be Cla&s;hing one again&s;t another; tend very much to the kee|ping up Heats and Differences among&s;t us, certainly prove the Ruin of Both in the end, and the Trade in a little time, will be Irrecoveraly lo&s;t. Therefore I am contrary to you, as to the pa&s;&s;ing your Bill.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, upon the whole Matter, you think we &s;hall make nothing of our Bill.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>New.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not &s;o neither, I am of Opinion that it will produce a good I&s;&s;ue between both Com|panies; in order thereto I am per&s;waded that the Members of the New Company, in re|&s;pect of the Good and Quiet of the Nation, will conde&s;cend &s;o far (tho' much to their Di&s;|advantage, and greatly again&s;t their Inclination to Mix with your Members) as to make &s;uch Propo&s;als for an Accommodation, that if your Company can come up to them in fairne&s;s, this Divi&s;ion will center in a Union.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, No, that will never do, for this is a Work of Time, and requires abundance of Thought; be&s;ides, the New Company will never yield to the Demands we &s;hall make for our Dead Stock. But pray &s;ince you Talk of a Union, which way can you pro|po&s;e it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>New.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, thus, Suppo&s;ing the New Company is &s;o generous as to let your old Members into One Million, with what they have already, which is one Half of their Stock and Trade, and &s;ubmit your Forts and Ca&s;tles to be valued by the Lords and Commons. This is an Expedient to make an United Stock. And as con&s;idering no Body knows the State of your Effects &s;o well as your Selves; or at lea&s;t are not inclinable to believe them &s;o Valuable as you wou'd have them accounted, you mu&s;t e'ne make the mo&s;t of them as fa&s;t as you can, and divide your Profits among&s;t your Selves, then you are &s;ure not to he wronged by others. By the&s;e means the Differences between both may be adju&s;t|ed. The Two Companies may be made into One in 14 Days, as well as 14 Years. But how long you will be in getting in your Effects, and paying your Debts, is a Time I can|not at pre&s;ent fix: Neither can I tell what the Dividend will be when the Account is Ballanced. But however I think my &s;elf obliged to &s;ay one Word by way of Advice to you, and the re&s;t of the Adventurers in the way of taking leave: Be led no longer by the No&s;e. Don't &s;uffer your Selves to be buffetted from Po&s;t to Pillar, by Pinning your Faith upon &s;uch that propo&s;e no more than to find a way out for them&s;elves, like Rats that quit the Hou&s;e before it falls. In a word, have a Care (according the Proverb) that you are not left with a Dog to hold.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old.</SPEAKER>
<P>I prote&s;t, you have &s;poke &s;o much that I'm confounded, I'm afraid there's too much Truth in what you've &s;aid, and for my own part I'll &s;tand it no longer, I'll go directly to the Coffee-hou&s;e this Minute, and di&s;po&s;e of my whole Parcel, that I may &s;leep quietly, and be Excu&s;ed in my attendance at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> on <HI>Friday,</HI> So farewell for One Hour or Two, I'l give you an Account what I have done when I return.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>New.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, fare you well, God &s;end you a good Deliverance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Brother New Company Man, I've done the Bu&s;ine&s;s, I've &s;old all, and thank you for your Advice, and to morrow I'l lay it out every bit in New-Stock, for in Truth, I &s;ee no Rea&s;on for the Bill to pa&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>New.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well Brother, I believe you'l find your Account in it, and in le&s;s then Eight and Forty Hours, I doubt not but to find more Converts, and &s;o A-Diew.</P>
