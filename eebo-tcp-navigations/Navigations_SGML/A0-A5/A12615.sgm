<P>Touching the commodities, be&s;ides the generall report of <HI>Cabe&ccedil;a de Vaca</HI> to <HI>Charles</HI> the Emperour (who fir&s;t tra|uelled through a great part of the Inland of <HI>Florida,</HI> next adioyning vpon our <HI>Virginia) That</HI> Florida <HI>was the ri|che&s;t countrie of the world; and, that after hee had found clothes made of cotton wooll,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. 35.</NOTE> <HI>he &s;aw gold and &s;iluer, and &s;tones of great value:</HI> I referre you fir&s;t to the rich mines of gold reported to be in the prouince of <HI>Yupaha,</HI> and de&s;cribed in the twelfth Chapter of this Treati&s;e to come within our limits: And againe, to the copper hatchets found in <HI>Cutifachiqui,</HI> &s;tanding vpon the Riuer of <HI>Santa Hele|na,</HI>
<PB REF="3"> which were &s;aid to haue a mixture of gold. It &s;eemeth al&s;o that the la&s;t Chronicler of the We&s;t Indies, <HI>Antonio de Herrera,</HI> &s;peaking of the fore&s;aid Riuer of <HI>Santa Helena,</HI> which &s;tandeth in <HI>32.</HI> degrees and an halfe, alludeth to the prouince of <HI>Yupaha,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Decad. 3 lib. 8. cap. 8.</NOTE> in the&s;e words: <HI>Y el oro, y plata, que hallaron, no era de aquella tierra, &s;ino de 60. leguas, adentro al norte, de los pueblos dichos</HI> Otapales <HI>y</HI> Ola|gatanos, <HI>adonde &s;e intiende, que ay minas de oro, plata, y cobre.</HI> That is to &s;ay, That the gold and &s;iluer which they found, was not of that countrie (of <HI>Santa Helena</HI>) but <HI>60.</HI> leagues di&s;tant toward the North, of the townes called <HI>Ota|pales</HI> and <HI>Olagatanos,</HI> where we vnder&s;tand that there are mines of gold, &s;iluer, and copper. By which reckoning the&s;e rich mines are in the latitude of <HI>35.</HI> degrees and an halfe. I de&s;ire you likewi&s;e to take knowledge of the famous golden prouince of <HI>Chi&s;ca,</HI> &s;tretching further to the North, where|of the Cacique of <HI>Co&s;te</HI> gaue notice to <HI>Ferdinando de So|to</HI> in the towne of <HI>Chiaha,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. 15.</NOTE> affirming, that there were mines of copper, and of another mettall of the &s;ame colour, &s;aue that it was finer, and of a farre more perfect lu&s;tre, and farre bet|ter in &s;ight, and that they v&s;ed it not &s;o much, becau&s;e it was &s;ofter. And the &s;elfe&s;ame thing was before told the Gouernour in <HI>Cutifachiqui:</HI> who &s;ent two Chri&s;tians from <HI>Chiaha</HI> with certaine Indians which knew the countrie of <HI>Chi&s;ca,</HI> and the language thereof, to view it, and to make report of that which they &s;hould finde.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. 23.</NOTE> We likewi&s;e reade not long af|ter, that the Gouernour &s;et forward to &s;eeke a prouince called <HI>Pacaha,</HI> which hee was informed to be neere vnto <HI>Chi&s;ca,</HI> where the Indians told him, that there was gold. And in another place hee &s;aith;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. 24.</NOTE> That from <HI>Pacaha</HI> hee &s;ent thirtie hor&s;emen and fiftie footmen to the prouince of <HI>Calu&ccedil;a,</HI> to &s;ee if from thence he might trauell to <HI>Chi&s;ca,</HI> where the Indians &s;aid, there was a worke of gold and copper. So that here is
<PB REF="3"> foure times mention, and that in &s;undrie places, of the rich and famous golde~ mines of <HI>Chi&s;ca,</HI> and that they lie beyond the mountaines toward the North, ouer which they were not able to trauell for the roughnes thereof. But what neede I to &s;tand vpon forren te&s;timonies, &s;ince Ma&s;ter <HI>Thomas He|riot,</HI> a man of much iudgement in the&s;e cau&s;es, &s;ignified vn|to you all, at your late &s;olemne meeting at the hou&s;e of the right honourable the Earle of Exeter, how to the Southwe&s;t of our old fort in <HI>Virginia,</HI> the Indians often informed him, that there was a great melting of red mettall, reporting the man|ner in working of the &s;ame. Be&s;ides, our owne Indians haue lately reuealed either this or another rich mine of copper or gold in a towne called <HI>Ritanoe,</HI> neere certaine mountaines lying We&s;t of <HI>Roanoac.</HI></P>
<P>Another very gainfull commoditie is, the huge quantitie of excellent perles, and little babies and birds made of them, that were found in <HI>Cutifachiqui.</HI> The abundance whereof is reported to be &s;uch,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. 14.</NOTE> that if they would haue &s;earched diuers graues in townes thereabout, they might haue laded many of their hor&s;es. Neither are the Turkie &s;tones and cotton wooll found at <HI>Gua&s;co</HI> to be forgotten, nor pa&s;&s;ed ouer in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>But that, which I make no &s;mall account of, is, the multi|tude of Oxen, which, from the beginning of the <HI>16.</HI> to the end of the <HI>26.</HI> Chapter, are nine &s;euerall times made mention of, and that along from <HI>Chiaha, Co&s;te, Pacaha, Coligoa,</HI> and <HI>Tulla,</HI> &s;till toward the North, to wit, toward vs, there was &s;uch &s;tore of them, that they could keepe no corne for them: and that the Indians liued vpon their fle&s;h. The haire of the&s;e Oxen is likewi&s;e &s;aid to be like a &s;oft wooll, betweene the cour&s;e and fine wooll of &s;heepe: and that they v&s;e them for couerlets, becau&s;e they are very &s;oft and woolled like &s;heep: and not &s;o onely, but they make bootes, &s;hooes, targets, and other things nece&s;&s;arie of the &s;ame. Be&s;ides the former bene|fits,
<PB REF="4"> their young ones may be framed to the yoke, for carting and tillage of our ground. And I am in good hope, that ere it be long we &s;hall haue notice of their being neerer vs, by that which I reade in the Italian relation of <HI>Cabe&ccedil;a de Vaca,</HI> the fir&s;t finder of them; which writeth, <HI>That they &s;pread them&s;elues within the countrie aboue foure hundred leagues.</HI> M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">reouer, <HI>Va&s;ques de Coronado,</HI> and long af|ter him, <HI>Antonio de E&s;pejo</HI> (who&s;e voiages are at large in my third volume) trauelled many leagues among the&s;e heards of Oxen, and found them from <HI>33.</HI> degrees ranging very farre to the North and Northea&s;t.</P>
<P>A fourth chiefe commoditie wee may account to be the great number of Mulberrie trees, apt to feede Silke-wormes to make &s;ilke: whereof there was &s;uch plentie in many places, that, though they found &s;ome hempe in the countrie, the Spa|niards made ropes of the barks of them for their brigandines, when they were to put to &s;ea for <HI>Noua Hi&s;pania.</HI></P>
<P>A fifth is the excellent and perfect colours, as black, white, greene, yellow, and red, and the materials to dye withall, &s;o often &s;poken of in this di&s;cour&s;e: among which I haue &s;ome hope to bring you to the knowledge of the rich graine of Co|chonillio, &s;o much e&s;teemed, and of &s;o great price. I &s;peake no|thing of the &s;euerall &s;orts of pa&s;sing good grapes for Wine and Rai&s;ons.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. 31. &amp; 32</NOTE>Neither is it the lea&s;t benefit, that they found &s;alt made by the Indians at <HI>Cayas,</HI> and in two places of the prouince of <HI>Aguacay:</HI> the manner al&s;o how the Inhabitants make it, is very well worth the ob&s;eruation.</P>
<P>One of the chiefe&s;t of all the re&s;t may be the notice of the S uth Sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. 31. &amp; 32</NOTE> leading vs to <HI>Iapan</HI> and <HI>China,</HI> which I finde here twice to be &s;poken of. Whereof long &s;ince I haue written a di&s;cour&s;e, which I thinke not fit to be made ouer common.</P>
<P>For clo&s;ing vp this point, The di&s;tances of places, the qua|lities
<PB REF="4"> of the &s;oiles, the &s;ituations of the regions, the diuer&s;ities and goodne&s;&s;e of the fruits, the &s;euerall &s;orts of bea&s;ts, the va|rietie of fowles, the difference betweene the Inhabitants of the mountaines and the plaines, and the riches of the Inland in compari&s;on of the Seacoa&s;t, are iudicially &s;et downe in the conclu&s;ion of this booke, whereunto for mine owne ea&s;e I re|ferre you.</P>
<P>To come to the &s;econd generall head, which in the begin|ning I propo&s;ed, concerning the manners and di&s;po&s;itions of the Inhabitants: among other things, I finde them here no|ted to be very eloquent and well &s;poken, as the &s;hort Orations, interpreted by <HI>Iohn Ortiz,</HI> which liued twelue yeeres among them, make &s;ufficient proofe. And the author, which was a gentleman of <HI>Eluas</HI> in <HI>Portugall,</HI> emploied in all the action, who&s;e name is not &s;et downe, &s;peaking of the Cacique of <HI>Tul|la,</HI> &s;aith, that a&s;well this Cacique, as the others, and all tho&s;e which came to the Gouernour on their behalfe, deliuered their me&s;&s;age or &s;peech in &s;o good order, that no Oratour could vtter the &s;ame more eloquently. But for all their faire and cunning &s;peeches, they are not ouermuch to be tru&s;ted: for they be the greate&s;t traitors of the world, as their mani|fold mo&s;t craftie contriued and bloody trea&s;ons, here &s;et down at large, doe euidently proue. They be al&s;o as vncon&s;tant as the wethercock, and mo&s;t readie to take all occa&s;ions of aduan|tages to doe mi&s;chiefe. They are great liars and di&s;&s;emblers; for which faults often times they had their de&s;erued pai|ments. And many times they gaue good te&s;timonie of their great valour and re&s;olution. To handle them gently, while gentle cour&s;es may be found to &s;erue, it will be without com|pari&s;on the be&s;t: but if gentle poli&s;hing will not &s;erue, then we &s;hall not want hammerours and rough ma&s;ons enow, I meane our old &s;oldiours trained vp in the Netherlands, to &s;quare and prepare them to our Preachers hands. To con|clude,
<PB REF="5"> I tru&s;t by your Honours and Wor&s;hips wi&s;e in&s;tructions to the noble Gouernour, the worthy experimented Lieutenant and Admirall, and other chiefe managers of the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, all things &s;hall be &s;o prudently carried, that the painfull Prea|chers &s;hall be reuerenced and cheri&s;hed, the valiant and for|ward &s;oldiour re&s;pected, the diligent rewarded, the coward emboldened, the weake and &s;ick relieued, the mutinous &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed, the reputation of the Chri&s;tians among the Saluages pre&s;erued, our mo&s;t holy faith exalted, all Pagani&s;me and Ido|latrie by little and little vtterly extingui&s;hed.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>_WHen <HI>Don Ferdinando</HI> had obtained the go|uernment, there came a Gentleman from the <HI>Indies</HI> to the Court, named <HI>Cabe&ccedil;a de Vaca,</HI> which had been with the Gouernor <HI>Pamphilo de Naruaez</HI> which died in <HI>Florida,</HI> who repor|ted that <HI>Naruaez</HI> was ca&s;t away at &s;ea with all the com|panie y^t went with him.

A&s;&s;oone as he had opportunitie hee &s;pake with the Emperour, and related vnto him what|&s;oeuer hee had pa&s;&s;ed and &s;eene, and come to vnder|&s;tand.

And a&s;&s;oone as they were on land, from the hou&s;es of the towne i&s;&s;ued a great number of Indians, which compa&s;&s;ed them about, and tooke them in a place where they could not flee: and the other which &s;ought to defend him&s;elfe, they pre&s;entlie killed vpon the place, and tooke <HI>Iohn Ortiz</HI> aliue, and carried him to <HI>Vcita</HI> their Lord. And tho&s;e of the brigandine &s;ought not to land, but put them&s;elues to &s;ea, and returned to the I&s;land of <HI>Cuba. Vcita</HI> commanded to bind <HI>Iohn Ortiz</HI> hand and foote vpon foure &s;takes aloft vpon a raft, and to make a fire vnder him, that there he might bee burned: But a daughter of his de&s;ired him that he would not put him to death, alleaging, that one only Chri&s;tian could do him neither hurt nor good, telling him, that it was more for his honour to keepe him as a captiue. And <HI>Vcita</HI> granted her reque&s;t, and comman|ded him to be cured of his wounds: and a&s;&s;oone as he was whole, he gaue him the charge of the keeping of the Temple: becau&s;e that by night the wolues did cary away the dead corp&s;es out of the &s;ame: who com|mended him&s;elfe to God and tooke vpon him the charge of his temple. One night the wolues gate from him the corpes of a little child, the &s;onne of a principal Indian; and going after them he threw a darte at one of the wolues and &s;trooke him that carried away the

Three yeeres after hee fell into his hands, there came another Lord, called <HI>Moco&ccedil;o,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Moco&ccedil;o dw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">lleth two daies iournie from Vcita.</NOTE> who dwelleth two daies iourny from the Port, and burned his towne. <HI>Vcita</HI> fled to another towne that he had in another &s;ea port.

And a&s;&s;one as they came to the towne with great outcries, many Indians came forth again&s;t him, and began to compa&s;&s;e him to &s;hoote at him: <HI>Iohn Ortiz</HI> &s;eeing him&s;elfe in &s;o great danger, &s;heilded him|&s;elfe with certaine trees, and began to &s;hreeke out, and crie very loud, and to tell them that he was a Chri&s;tian, and that he was fled from <HI>Vcita,</HI> and was come to &s;ee and &s;erue <HI>Moco&ccedil;o</HI> his Lord. It plea&s;ed God that at that very in&s;tant there came thither an Indian that could &s;peake the language and vnder&s;tood him; and pacifi|ed the re&s;t; who told them what hee &s;aid. Then ran from thence three or foure Indians to beare the newes to their Lord: who came foorth a quarter of a league from the towne to receiue him; and was very glad of him. He cau&s;ed him pre&s;ently to &s;weare according to the cu&s;tome of the Chri&s;tians, that hee would not run away from him to any other Lord: and promi&s;ed him to entreate him very well; and that if at any time there came any Chri&s;tians into that countrie, he would free|ly let him goe, and giue him leaue to goe to them: and likewi&s;e tooke his oth to performe the &s;ame according
<PB N="25" REF="17"> to the Indian cu&s;tome. About three yeeres after cer|taine Indians, which were fi&s;hing at &s;ea two leagues from the towne, brought newes to <HI>Moco&ccedil;o</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Moco&ccedil;o his towne within 2. leagues of the &s;ea.</NOTE> that they had &s;eene &s;hips: and hee called <HI>Iohn Ortiz,</HI> and gaue him leaue to go his way: who taking his leaue of him, with all the ha&s;te he could came to the &s;ea, and finding no &s;hips, he thought it to be &s;ome deceit, and that the Cacique had done the &s;ame to learne his mind. So he dwelt with <HI>Moco&ccedil;o</HI> nine yeeres, with &s;mall hope of &s;ee|ing any Chri&s;tians. A&s;&s;oone as our Gouernor arriued in <HI>Florida,</HI> it was knowne to <HI>Moco&ccedil;o,</HI> &amp; &s;traightway he &s;ignified to <HI>Iohn Ortiz,</HI> that Chri&s;tians were lodged in the towne of <HI>Vcita:</HI> And he thought he had ie&s;ted with him, as hee had done before, and told him, that by this time he had forgotten the Chri&s;tians, and thought of nothing el&s;e but to &s;erue him. But he a&s;&s;ured him that it was &s;o, and gaue him licence to goe vnto them: &s;ay|ing vnto him, that if hee would not doe it, and if the Chri&s;tians &s;hould goe their way, he &s;hould not blame him, for hee had fulfilled that which he had promi&s;ed him.

The <HI>Cacique Mo|co&ccedil;o</HI> came to the Port to vi&s;it the Gouernor, and made this &s;peech following.</P>
<P><HI>Right hie and mightie Lord, I being le&s;&s;er in mine owne conceit for to obey you, then any of tho&s;e which you haue vn|der your command; and greater in de&s;ire to doe you greater &s;eruices, doe appeare before your Lord&s;hip with &s;o much confi|dence of receiuing fauour, as if in effect this my good will were manife&s;ted vnto you in workes: not for the &s;mall &s;eruice I did vnto you touching the Chri&s;tian which I had in my power, in giuing him freely his libertie, (For I was bound to doe it to pre&s;erue mine honour, and that which I had promi|&s;ed him:) but becau&s;e it is the part of great men to v&s;e great magnificences: And I am per&s;waded, that as in bodily per|fections, and commanding of good people, you doe exceede all men in the world, &s;o likewi&s;e you doe in the parts of the minde, in which you may boa&s;t of the bountie of nature. The fauour which I hope for of your Lord&s;hip is, that you would hold mee for yours, and bethinke your &s;elfe to command me any thing, wherein I may doe you &s;eruice.</HI></P>
<P>The Gouernour an&s;wered him, That although in freeing and &s;ending him the Chri&s;tian, he had pre&s;er|ued his honour and promi&s;e, yet he thanked him, and
<PB N="27" REF="18"> held it in &s;uch e&s;teeme, as it had no compari&s;on; and that hee would alwaies hold him as his brother, and would fauour him in all things to the vtmo&s;t of his power.

<P>_ON Weden&s;day the third of March,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March the 3. 1540.</NOTE> of the yeere 1540. the Gouernor departed from <HI>Anaica Apalache</HI> to &s;eeke <HI>Yupaha.</HI> He com|manded his men to goe prouided with Maiz for &s;ixtie leagues of de&s;ert. The hor&s;emen car|ried their Maiz on their hor&s;es, and the footemen at their &s;ides: becau&s;e the Indians that were for &s;eruice, with their mi&s;erable life that they lead that winter, be|ing naked and in chaines, died for the mo&s;t part. With|in foure daies iournie they came to a great Riuer:<NOTE PLACE="marg">A great Riuer.</NOTE> and they made a piragua or ferrie bote, and becau&s;e of the great current, they made a cable with chaines, which they fa&s;tened on both &s;ides of the Riuer; and the fer|rie bote went along by it; and the hor&s;es &s;wam ouer, being drawne with cap&s;tans. Hauing pa&s;&s;ed the Riuer, in a day and an halfe, they came to a towne called <HI>Ca|pachiqui.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Capachiqui.</NOTE> Vpon Friday, the 11. of March, they found
<PB N="42" REF="26"> Indians in armes. The next day fiue Chri&s;tians went to &s;eeke morters, which the Indians haue to beate their Maiz, and they went to certaine hou&s;es on the back|&s;ide of the Campe enuironed with a wood: And with|in the wood were many Indians which came to &s;pie vs; of the which came other fiue and &s;et vpon vs. One of the Chri&s;tians came running away, giuing an a|l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">rme vnto the Campe. Tho&s;e which were mo&s;t readie an&s;wered the alarme. They found one Chri&s;tian dead, and three &s;ore wounded. The Indians fled vnto a lake adioyning neere a very thicke wood, where the hor&s;es could not enter. The Gouernour departed from <HI>Ca|pachiqui,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ed through a de&s;ert. On Wedne&s;day the 21. of the moneth he came to a towne called <HI>To|alli:</HI> And from thence forward there was a difference in the hou&s;es. For tho&s;e which were behind vs were thatched with &s;traw, and tho&s;e of <HI>Toalli</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Toalli.</NOTE> were couered with reeds, in manner of tiles. The&s;e hou&s;es are verie cleanly. Some of them had walles daubed with clay, which &s;hewed like a mudwall. In all the cold Coun|trie the Indians haue euery one a hou&s;e for the winter daubed with clay within and without, and the doore is very little: they &s;hut it by night, and make fire with|in; &s;o that they are in it as warme as in a &s;toue: and &s;o it continueth all night that they need not clothes: and be&s;ides the&s;e, they haue others for &s;ummer; and their kitchins neere them, where they make fire and bake their bread: and they haue barbacoas wherein they keepe their Maiz; which is an hou&s;e &s;et vp in the aire vpon foure &s;takes, boorded about like a chamber, and the floore of it is of cane hurdles. The differe~ce which Lords or principall mens hou&s;es haue from the re&s;t, be&s;ides they be greater, is, that they haue great galle|ries
<PB N="43" REF="26"> in their fronts, and vnder them &s;eates made of canes in manner of benches: and round about them they haue many lofts, wherein they lay vp that which the Indians doe giue them for tribute, which is Maiz, Deeres skins, and mantles of the Countrie, which are like blankets: they make them of the inner rinde of the barkes of trees, and &s;ome of a kind of gra&s;&s;e like vnto nettles, which being beaten, is like vnto flaxe.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A gra&s;&s;e like flaxe.</NOTE> The wo|men couer them&s;elues with the&s;e mantles; they put one about them from the wa&s;t downeward; and ano|ther ouer their &s;houlder, with their right arme out, like vnto the Egyptians. The men weare but one mantle vpon their &s;houlders after the &s;ame manner: and haue their &s;ecrets hid with a Deeres skin, made like a linen breech, which was wont to be v&s;ed in <HI>Spaine.</HI> The skins are well corried,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Excellent colours.</NOTE> and they giue them what colour they li&s;t, &s;o perfect, that if it be red, it &s;eemeth a very fine cloth in graine, and the blacke is mo&s;t fine: and of the &s;ame leather they make &s;hooes; and they die their man|tles in the &s;ame colours.

It was a thing &s;o &s;trange, and cau&s;ed &s;uch feare and terrour in our mindes, that it was not in our power to &s;tay and receiue your Lord&s;hip with the &s;olemnitie due to &s;o high and renowned a Prince, as your Lord&s;hip is. And tru|&s;ting in your greatne&s;&s;e and &s;ingular vertues, I doe not onely hope to be freed from blame, but al&s;o to receiue fauours: and the fir&s;t which I demand of your Lord&s;hip is, that you will v&s;e me, my Countrie, and &s;ubiects as your owne: and the &s;econd, that you will tell mee who you are, and whence you come, and whither you goe, and what you &s;eeke, that I the better may &s;erue you therein.</HI></P>
<P>The Gouernour an&s;wered him, that hee thanked him as much for his offer and good will, as if hee had receiued it, and as if hee had offered him a great trea|&s;ure: and told him that he was the &s;onne of the Sun, and came from tho&s;e parts where he dwelt, and trauel|led through that Countrie, and &s;ought the greate&s;t Lord, and riche&s;t Prouince that was in it.

<P>IN the towne of <HI>Patofa</HI> the youth, which the Go|uernour carried with him for an interpretour and a guide, began to &s;ome at the mouth, and tum|ble on the ground, as one po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the diuell:

Hee gaue him &s;euen hundred Indians to beare burdens. He tooke Maiz for foure daies iournie. Hee trauelled &s;ixe daies by a path which grew narrow more and more, till it was lo&s;t altogether: He went where the youth did lead him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two &s;wift Riuers.</NOTE> and pa&s;&s;ed two Riuers which were waded: each of them was two cro&s;&s;ebow &s;hot ouer: the water came to the &s;tirrops, and had &s;o great a current, that it was needfull for the hor&s;emen to &s;tand one before a|nother, that the footemen might pa&s;&s;e aboue them lea|ning vnto them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Another greater Riuer.</NOTE> He came to another Riuer of a grea|ter current and largenes, which was pa&s;&s;ed with more trouble, becau&s;e the hor&s;es did &s;wim at the comming out about a lances length.

<P> How the Gouernour departed from <HI>Cutifa-Chiqui</HI> to &s;eeke the Prouince of <HI>Co&ccedil;a;</HI> and what happened vn|to him in the way.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe Gouernour departed from <HI>Cutifa Chiqui</HI> the third day of May. And becau&s;e the Indi|ans had reuolted, and the will of the Ladie was perceiued, that if &s;he could, &s;he would depart without
<PB N="56" REF="33"> giuing any guides or men for burdens, for the wrongs which the Chri&s;tians had done to the Indians: (for there neuer want &s;ome among many of a ba&s;e &s;ort, that for a little gaine doe put them&s;elues and others in dan|ger of vndoing.) The Gouernour commanded her to be kept in &s;afegard, and carried with him, not with &s;o good v&s;age as &s;he de&s;erued for y^e good wil &s;he &s;hewed, and good entertainement that &s;he had made him. And he verified that old prouerb which &s;aith; For weldoing I receiue euill. And &s;o he carried her on foot with his bondwomen to looke vnto her. In all the townes where the Gouernour pa&s;&s;ed, the Ladie commanded the Indians to come and carrie the burdens from one towne to another. We pa&s;&s;ed through her Countrie an hundred leagues, in which, as we &s;aw, &s;he was much obeyed. For the Indians did all that &s;he commanded them with great efficacie and diligence. <HI>Peter</HI> the youth that was our guide, &s;aid, that &s;he was not the La|die her &s;elfe, but a neece of hers, which came to that towne to execute certaine principal men by comman|dement of the Ladie, which had withheld her tribute: which words were not beleeued, becau&s;e of the lies which they had found in him before: but they bare with all things, becau&s;e of the need which they had of him, to declare what the Indians &s;aid. In &s;euen daies &s;pace the Gouernour came to a Prouince called <HI>Chala|que,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chalaque &s;e|uen daies iournie from Cutifa Chi|q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">i.</NOTE> the poore&s;t Country of Maiz that was &s;eene in <HI>Flo|rida.</HI> The Indians fed vpon rootes and herbes which they &s;eeke in the fields, and vpon wild bea&s;ts, which they kil with their bowes and arrowes: and it is a verie gentle people. All of them goe naked, and are very leane. There was a Lord, which for a great pre&s;ent, brought the Gouernour two Deeres skins: and there

She carried away with her a little che&s;t made of canes in manner of a coffer, which they call Petaca, full of vnbored perles. Some which could iudge of them, &s;aid, that they were of great value. An Indian woman that waited on her did carrie them. The Go|uernour not to di&s;content her altogether, left them with her, making account that in <HI>Guaxule</HI> he would ask them of her, when he gaue her leaue to returne: which coffer &s;he carried away, and went to <HI>Xualla</HI> with three &s;laues which fled from the Campe, and one hor&s;eman which remained behind, who falling &s;icke of an ague went out of the way, and was lo&s;t.

<P>The Gouernor an&s;wered him, that he thanked him very much for his &s;eruice and offer, and that he would alwaies account him as his brother.

<PB N="60" REF="35"> becau&s;e the Indians &s;taied in their towne, the Gouer|nour only lodged in the hou&s;es of the Cacique, and his people in the fields; where there was euer a tree, e|uerie one tooke one for him&s;elfe.

<P>_THe Gouernour &s;eeing the determi|nation, and furious an&s;were of the Cacique, went about to pacifie him with faire words: to which he gaue no an&s;were, but rather with much pride and di&s;daine, with|drew him&s;elfe where the Gouernor might not &s;ee him, nor &s;peake with him. As a princi|pall Indian pa&s;&s;ed that way, the Gouernor called him, to &s;end him word, that hee might remaine at his plea|&s;ure in his Countrie, and that it would plea&s;e him to giue him a guide, and men for carriages, to &s;ee if hee could pacifie him with mild words.

The Gouer|nour con&s;ideing, that if hee tarried <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">here, hee could not e&s;cape, and if hee commanded his men to come
<PB N="75" REF="42"> in, which were without the towne, the Indians with|in the hou&s;es might kill their hor&s;es, and doe much hurt, ranne out of the towne, and before hee came out, hee fell twice or thrice, and tho&s;e that were with him did helpe him vp againe; and he and tho&s;e that were with him were &s;ore wounded: and in a mo|ment there were fiue Chri&s;tians &s;laine in the towne.

And from others that had entred the towne with the Gouernour they had taken &s;words and halebards, and fought with them. When the Gouernour was gotten into the field, hee called for an hor&s;e, and with &s;ome that accompanied him, hee returned and &s;lew two or three Indians: All the re&s;t retired them&s;elues to the towne, and &s;hot with their bowes from the wall.

For all this hee would not haue gon away: but they vrged him &s;o much, that with fifteene or twentie Indians of his owne, hee went out of the towne, and carried away a skarlat cloke, and other things of the Chri&s;tians goods; as much as hee was able to carrie, and &s;eemed be&s;t vnto him.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>_VPon Wedne&s;day the 15. of March 1541. after the Gouernour had lodged 8. daies in a plaine, halfe a league from the place which he had wintered in, after he had &s;et vp a forge, and tempered the &s;words which in <HI>Chica&ccedil;a</HI> were burned, and made many targets, &s;addles, and lan|ces, on Tue&s;day night, at the morning watch, many In|dians came to a&s;&s;ault the Campe in three &s;quadrons, euery one by them&s;elues: Tho&s;e which watched gaue the alarme. The Gouernour with great &s;peed &s;et his men in order in other three &s;quadrons, and leauing &s;ome to defend the Campe, went out to incounter them. The Indians were ouercome and put to flight. The ground was champion and fit for y^e Chri&s;tians to take the aduantage of them; and it was now breake of day. But there happened a di&s;order, whereby there were not pa&s;t thirtie or fortie Indians &s;laine: and this it was: that a Frier cried out in the Campe without
<PB N="87" REF="48"> any iu&s;t occa&s;ion, To the Campe, To the Campe: Whereupon the Gouernour and all the re&s;t repaired thither, and the Indians had time to &s;aue them&s;elues. There were &s;ome taken, by whom the Gouernour in|formed him&s;elfe of the Countrie, through which hee was to pa&s;&s;e. The 25. of Aprill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">25. of Aprill.</NOTE> he departed from <HI>Chi|ca&ccedil;a,</HI> and lodged at a &s;mall towne called <HI>Alimamu.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Alimamu.</NOTE> They had very little Maiz, and they were to pa&s;&s;e a de|&s;ert of &s;euen daies iournie. The next day, the Gouer|nour &s;ent three Captaines euerie one his way with hor&s;emen and footemen to &s;eeke proui&s;ion to pa&s;&s;e the de&s;ert. And <HI>Iohn Dannu&s;co</HI> the Auditor went with fifteene hor&s;emen, and 40. footemen that way that the Gouernour was to goe, and found a &s;trong fort made, where the Indians &s;taied for him, and many of them walked on the top of it with their weapons, hauing their bodies, thighes and armes okered and died with blacke, white, yellow and red, &s;triped like vnto panes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Blacke, white, yellow and red colours.</NOTE> &s;o that they &s;hewed as though they went in ho&s;e and doublets: and &s;ome of them had plumes, and others had hornes on their heads, and their faces blacke, and their eies done round about with &s;trakes of red, to &s;eeme more fierce. A&s;&s;oone as they &s;aw that the Chri|&s;tians approched, with a great crie &s;ounding two drummes with great furie they &s;allied foorth to re|ceiue them. <HI>Iohn Dannu&s;co</HI> and tho&s;e that were with him, thought good to auoid them, and to acquaint the Gouernour therewith. They retired to a plaine place, a cro&s;&s;ebow &s;hot from the fort in &s;ight of it, the foote|men, the cro&s;&s;ebowmen, and targetters placed them|&s;elues before the hor&s;emen, that they might not hurt the hor&s;es. The Indians &s;allied out by &s;euen and &s;euen, and eight and eight to &s;hoote their arrowes, and reti|red
<PB N="88" REF="49"> againe: and in &s;ight of the Chri&s;tians they made a fire, and tooke an Indian, &s;ome by the feete, and &s;ome by the head, and made as though they went to ca&s;t him into the fire, and gaue him fir&s;t many knocks on the head: &s;ignifying, that they meant &s;o to handle the Chri&s;tians. <HI>Iohn Danu&s;co</HI> &s;ent three hor&s;emen to aduer|ti&s;e the Gouernour hereof. He came pre&s;ently: for his intent was to driue them from thence, &s;aying, that if he did it not, they would be emboldned to charge him a|nother time, when they might doe him more harme. He made the hor&s;emen to alight, and &s;et his men in foure &s;quadrons: The &s;igne being giuen, they &s;et vp-the Indians, which made re&s;i&s;tance till the Chri&s;tians came neere the fort, and a&s;&s;oone as they &s;aw they could not defend the~&s;elues, by a place where a brooke pa&s;&s;ed neere the fort, they ran away, and from the o|ther&s;ide they &s;hot &s;ome arrowes: and becau&s;e at that in&s;tant we knew no ford for the hor&s;es to pa&s;&s;e, they had time enough to get out of our danger. Three In|dians were &s;laine there, and many Chri&s;tians were hurt, whereof within few daies, there died fifteene by the way. All men thought the Gouernour to bee in fault, becau&s;e he &s;ent not to &s;ee the di&s;po&s;ition of the place on the other &s;ide of the Riuer, and to know the pa&s;&s;age before hee &s;et vpon them. For with the hope they had to &s;aue them&s;elues by flight that way, when they &s;aw none other meanes, they fought til they were broken, and it was an incouragement to defend them|&s;elues vntill then, and to offend the Chri&s;tians without any danger to them&s;elues.</P>

The mother of the Cacique was taken there: and he &s;ent vnto him by an Indian, that he &s;hould come to &s;ee him, and that he would giue him his mother, and al the people which he had taken there. The Cacique &s;ent him an&s;were againe, that his Lord&s;hip &s;hould loo&s;e and &s;end them to him, and that he would come to vi&s;it and &s;erue him. The Gouernour, becau&s;e his people for want of Maiz were &s;omewhat weake and wearie, and the hor&s;es al&s;o were leane, determined to accompli&s;h his reque&s;t, to &s;ee if hee could haue peace with him, and &s;o commanded to &s;et free his mother and all the re&s;t, and with louing words di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them and &s;ent them to him.

<P>_THe Gouernor re&s;ted a moneth in the Pro|uince of <HI>Cayas.</HI> In which time the hor&s;es fattened and thriued more, then in other places in a longer time, with the great plentie of Maiz and the leaues thereof, which I thinke was the be&s;t that hath been &s;eene, and they dranke of a lake of very hot water, and &s;omewhat bracki&s;h,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A lake of hot and &s;omewhat bracki&s;h wa|ter.

Vntill that time the Chri&s;tians wanted &s;alt, and there they made good &s;tore, which they carried along with them. The Indians doe carrie it to other places
<PB N="110" REF="60"> to exchange it for skinnes and mantles. They make it along the Riuer, which when it ebbeth, leaueth it vp|on the vpper part of the &s;and. And becau&s;e they can|not make it, without much &s;and mingled with it, they throw it into certaine baskets which they haue for that purpo&s;e, broad at the mouth, and narrow at the bottom, and &s;et it in the aire vpon a barre, and throw water into it, and &s;et a &s;mall ve&s;&s;ell vnder it, wherein it falleth: Being &s;trained and &s;et to boile vpon the fire, when the water is &s;odden away, the &s;alt remaineth in the bottome of the pan. On both &s;ides of the Riuer the Countrie was full of &s;owne fields, and there was &s;tore of Maiz. The Indians dur&s;t not come ouer where wee were: &amp; when &s;ome of them &s;hewed them&s;elues, the &s;ouldiers that &s;aw them called vnto them; then the In|dians pa&s;&s;ed the Riuer, and came with them where the Gouernor was. He asked the~ for the Cacique. They &s;aid, that he remained quiet, but that he dur&s;t not &s;hew him&s;elfe. The Gouernour pre&s;ently &s;ent him word, that he &s;hould come vnto him, and bring him a guide and an interpretour for his iournie, if he made account of his friend&s;hip: and if he did not &s;o, he would come him&s;elfe to &s;eeke him, and that it would bee the wor&s;e for him. Hee waited three daies, and &s;eeing he came not, he went to &s;eeke him, and brought him pri&s;oner with 150. of his men. He asked him, whether hee had notice of any great Cacique, &amp; which way the Coun|trie was be&s;t inhabited. Hee an&s;wered, that the be&s;t Countrie thereabout was a Prouince toward the South, a day and an halfes iournie, which was called <HI>Tulla;</HI> and that he could giue him a guide, but no in|terpretour, becau&s;e the &s;peech of that Countrie was different from his, and becau&s;e he and his ance&s;tors
<PB N="111" REF="60"> had alwaies warres with the Lords of that Prouince; therefore they had no commerce, nor vnder&s;tood one anothers language. Immediatly the Gouernour with certaine hor&s;emen, and 50. footemen, departed to|ward <HI>Tulla,</HI> to &s;ee if the Countrie were &s;uch, as hee might pa&s;&s;e through it with all his companie: and a&s;|&s;oone as he arriued there,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tulla.</NOTE> and was e&s;pied of the Indi|ans, the Countrie gathered together, and a&s;&s;oone as 15. and 20. Indians could a&s;&s;emble them&s;elues, they &s;et vpon the Chri&s;tians: and &s;eeing that they did han|dle them &s;hrewdly, and that the hor&s;emen ouertooke them when they fled, they gat vp into the tops of their hou&s;es, and &s;ought to defend them&s;elues with their ar|rowes: and being beaten downe from one, they gat vp vpon another. And while our men pur&s;ued &s;ome, others &s;et vpon them another way. Thus the skirmi&s;h la&s;ted &s;o long, that the hor&s;es were tired, and they could not make them runne. The Indians killed there one hor&s;e, and &s;ome were hurt. There were 15. Indi|ans &s;laine there, and 40. women and boies were taken pri&s;oners. For what&s;oeuer Indian did &s;hoot at them, if they could come by him, they put him to the &s;word. The Gouernour determined to returne toward <HI>Cayas,</HI> before the Indians had time to gather a head; and pre&s;ently that euening, going part of y^e night to leaue <HI>Tulla,</HI> he lodged by the way, and the next day came to <HI>Cayas:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gouer|nor commeth againe to Tul|la with all his companie.</NOTE> and within three daies after he departed the~ce toward <HI>Tulla</HI> with all his companie: He carried the Cacique along with him, and among all his men, there was not one found that could vnder&s;tand the &s;peech of <HI>Tulla.</HI> He &s;taied three daies by the way, and the day that he came thither, he found the towne abando|ned: for the Indians dur&s;t not tarrie his comming.

<P><HI>Mightie and excellent Lord, I be&s;eech your Lord&s;hip to pardon mee the errour which I committed in ab&s;enting my &s;elfe, and not tarrying in this towne to haue receiued and &s;er|ued your Lord&s;hip; &s;ince, to obtaine this opportunitie of time, was, and is as mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">h as a great v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">rie to me.

<P>The Gouernour receiued him with much ioy, and gaue him thankes for his pre&s;ent and offer. He a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ked him, whether hee had any notice of the Sea. Hee an|&s;wered, no, nor of any townes downe the Riuer on that &s;ide; &s;aue that two leagues from thence was one towne of a principall Indian a &s;ubiect of his; and on
<PB N="124" REF="67"> the other &s;ide of the Riuer, three daies iourney from thence downe the Riuer, was the Prouince of <HI>Qui|galta,</HI> which was the greate&s;t Lord that was in that Countrie. The Gouernour thought that the Cacique lied vnto him, to rid him out of his owne townes, and &s;ent <HI>Iohn Danu&s;co</HI> with eight hor&s;emen downe the Ri|uer, to &s;ee what habitation there was, and to informe him&s;elfe, if there were any notice of the Sea.

The Gouernour fell into great dumps to &s;ee how hard it was to get to the Sea: and wor&s;e, be|cau&s;e his men and hor&s;es euery day dimini&s;hed, being without &s;uccour to &s;u&s;taine them&s;elues in the country: and with that thought he fell &s;ick.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gouer|nor falleth &s;ick of thought.</NOTE> But before he tooke his bed hee &s;ent an Indian to the Cacique of <HI>Quigalta</HI> to tell him, that hee was the Childe of the Sunne, and that all the way that hee came all men obeyed and &s;er|ued him, that he reque&s;ted him to accept of his friend|&s;hip, and come vnto him; for he would be very glad to &s;ee him; and in &s;igne of loue and obedience to bring &s;omething with him of that which in his countrie was mo&s;t e&s;teemed.

<P>By that time the Indian returned with this an&s;were, the Gouernour had betaken him&s;elfe to bed, being euill handled with feuers, and was much aggrieued, that he was not in ca&s;e to pa&s;&s;e pre&s;ently the Riuer and to &s;eeke him, to &s;ee if he could abate that pride of his, con&s;idering the Riuer went now very &s;trongly in tho&s;e parts; for it was neere halfe a league broad, and 16. fa|thomes deep, and very furious, and ranne with a great current; and on both &s;ides there were many Indians, and his power was not now &s;o great, but that hee had need to helpe him&s;elfe rather by &s;lights then by force. The Indians of <HI>Guachoya</HI> came euery day with fi&s;h in &s;uch numbers, that the towne was full of them. The Cacique &s;aid, that on a certaine night hee of <HI>Quigalta</HI> would come to giue battell to the Gouernour. Which the Gouernour imagined that he had deui&s;ed, to driue him out of his countrey, and commanded him to bee put in hold: and that night and all the re&s;t, there was good watch kept.

<P>_WHen that which was determined was publi&s;hed in the Campe, there were many that were greatly grieued at it: for they held the Sea voyage as doubtfull, for the euill meanes they had, and of as great danger, as the trauelling by land: and they hoped to finde &s;ome rich countrie before they came to the land of the Chri|&s;tians, by that which <HI>Cabe&ccedil;a de Vaca</HI> had told the Em|perour: and that was this; That after hee had found clothes made of cotton wooll,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gold, &s;iluer and pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ciou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 span">.</NOTE> hee &s;aw gold and &s;iluer, and &s;tones of great value.

And albeit, they were neere the &s;hore, yet it was &s;o deepe, that the Diuers di|uing many times could neuer find it: which cau&s;ed great &s;adnes in the Gouernour, and in all tho&s;e that went with him in his brigandine: But with a grind|&s;tone which they had, and certaine bridles which re|mained to &s;ome of the Gentlemen, and men of wor|&s;hip which had hor&s;es, they made a weight which &s;er|ued in &s;tead of an anker.

Some of them that came from <HI>Florida</HI> &s;taied a moneth in <HI>Panuco</HI> to re&s;t them&s;elues, others fifteene daies, and euery one as long as he li&s;ted: for there was none that &s;hewed a &s;ower countenance to his gue&s;ts, but rather gaue them any thing that they had, and &s;ee|med to be grieued when they took their leaue. Which was to be beleeued. For the victuals, which the Indi|ans doe pay them for tribute, are more then they can &s;pend: and in that towne is no commerce; and there
<PB N="175" REF="92"> dwelt but few Spaniards there, and they were glad of their companie. The Alcalde Mayor diuided all the Emperours clothes which he had (which there they pay him for his tribute) among tho&s;e that would come to receiue them. Tho&s;e which had &s;hirts of maile le&s;t, were glad men: for they had a hor&s;e for one &s;hirt of maile: Some hor&s;ed them&s;elues: and &s;uch as could not (which were the greate&s;t part) tooke their iournie on foote: in which they were well receiued of the In|dians that were in the townes, and better &s;erued, then they could haue been in their owne hou&s;es, though they had been well to liue. For if they asked one hen of an Indian, they brought them foure: and if they as|ked any of the Countrie fruit, though it were a league off, they ran pre&s;ently for it. And if any Chri&s;tian found him&s;elf euill at ea&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This is the manner of China, to car|rie men in chaires.</NOTE> they carried him in a chaire from one towne to another. In what&s;oeuer towne they came, the Cacique, by an Indian which carri|ed a rod of Iu&s;tice in his hand, whom they call Ta|pile, that is to &s;ay, a &s;ergeant, commanded them to prouide victuals for them, and Indians to beare bur|dens of &s;uch things as they had, and &s;uch as were needfull to carrie them that were &s;icke. The Vice|roy &s;ent a Portugall 20. leagues from <HI>Mexico,</HI> with great &s;tore of &s;ugar, rai&s;ons of the Sunne, and con|&s;erues, and other things fit for &s;icke folkes, for &s;uch as had neede of them: and had giuen order to cloth them all at the Emperours charges. And their approch being knowne by the citizens of <HI>Mexico,</HI> they went out of the towne to receiue them: and with great courte&s;ie, reque&s;ting them in fauour to come to their hou&s;es, e|uery one carried &s;uch as hee met home with him, and
<PB N="176" REF="93"> clothed them euery one the be&s;t they could: &s;o that he which had the meane&s;t apparrell, it co&s;t aboue 30. ducats. As many as were willing to come to the Vice|royes hou&s;e he commanded to be apparelled, and &s;uch as were per&s;ons of qualitie &s;ate at his table: and there was a table in his hou&s;e for as many of the meaner &s;ort as would come to it: and he was pre&s;ently informed, who euery one was, to &s;hew him the courte&s;ie that he de&s;erued. Some of the Co~querors did &s;et both gentle|men and clownes at their owne table, and many times made the &s;eruant &s;it cheeke by cheeke by his ma&s;ter: and chiefly the officers and men of ba&s;e condition did &s;o: for tho&s;e which had better education did enquire who euery one was, and made difference of per&s;ons: but all did what they could with a good will: and eue|ry one told them whom they had in their hou&s;es, that they &s;hould not trouble them&s;elues, nor thinke them|&s;elues the wor&s;e, to take that which they gaue them: for they had bin in the like ca&s;e, and had bin relieued of others, and that this was the cu&s;tome of that coun|trey. God reward them all: and God grant, that tho&s;e which it plea&s;ed him to deliuer out of <HI>Florida,</HI> and to bring againe into Chri&s;tendome, may &s;erue him: and vnto tho&s;e that died in that countrey, and vnto all that beleeue in him and confe&s;&s;e his holy faith, God for his mercie &s;ake grant the kingdome of heauen.
