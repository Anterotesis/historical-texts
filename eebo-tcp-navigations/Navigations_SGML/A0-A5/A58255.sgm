<HEAD>REASONS Humbly Offered, <HI>For not Doubling the Sub&s;idy on</HI> Tobacco <HI>from</HI> Virginia <HI>and</HI> Maryland, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THat the laying &s;uch additional Sub&s;idy on Tobacco of 1 d. <HI>per</HI> Pound, above the 5 <HI>d.</HI> already laid by Act of Parliament, will become a great Injury to the Trade of this Kingdom, and to the Plantations of <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Maryland.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. Becau&s;e thereby it will be advanced to Forreign Markets, which will gradually bring the Trade of our Plantations out of u&s;e, by the planting it in <HI>Europe,</HI> it being evident that the affording our Plan|tations Tobacco cheap, is a con&s;iderable Occa&s;ion and Support of our Trade to <HI>Holland</HI> and the <HI>Baltick Seas,</HI> the great Expence of Tobacco being among&s;t the poorer &s;ort of People. Be&s;ides, 'tis evident, to all that know <HI>Holland</HI> and other parts adjoyning as <HI>Gelderland, &V;tricb, Hanover, Brabant,</HI> and &s;everal other Parts of <HI>Germany,</HI> plant great Quantity of Tobacco yearly, computed to be of equal Quantity with either of the Provinces of <HI>Virginia</HI> or <HI>Maryland,</HI> and would &s;ooner enlarge their Planting if made dearer by Law.</P>
<P N="2">II. Be&s;ides, &s;uch Duties may occa&s;ion others in Forreign Parts, to add greater Duty on our Plantation Tobacco, to encourage their own Growth, which hitherto they have not done.</P>
<P N="3">III. It will occa&s;ion the le&s;sning the Con&s;umption by its dearne&s;s, becau&s;e the poore&s;t &s;ort of labouring People are the greate&s;t Con|&s;umers, be&s;ides the debauchery by Stalks, and otherwi&s;e u&s;ed to make it cheap.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Such great Duty will occa&s;ion great Quantities to be run on Shore, and &s;mugled in many Out ports and Creaks of the King|dom, to the Ruine of tho&s;e that &s;hall pay the Duty, and to the De&s;truction of fair Traders.</P>
<P N="5">V. It will al&s;o &s;well the Duty to &s;uch a great Summ, that the Traders in it will not be able to advance it, nor will it be worth any Man's doing it, becau&s;e that the Intere&s;t of the Money that mu&s;t redeem the Goods, will in Value exceed the Principle of the Goods; &s;o that thereby the Plantations will inevitably be di&s;couraged.</P>
<P N="6">VI. And further the Hazards of Debts contracted by Sale of Tobacco, will be &s;o great, that no Man will trade in it, when
<PB N="2" REF="2">the Merchants mu&s;t give Credit for eight times the Value of his Principle by Cu&s;tom, Fraight and Charges, by which means all Merchandize will be di&s;couraged.</P>
<P N="7">VII. It will al&s;o hereby greatly abate the Navigation to tho&s;e Plantations, to the Prejudice of this Nation, which employs 200 Sail of Ships at lea&s;t yearly in it.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. It will al&s;o abate the Con&s;umption of the Manufactures of this Kingdom, on which tho&s;e Plantations have hitherto depend|ed, and have in this particular been more u&s;eful to this Nation than any Plantations of his Kingdom whatever, and that while Laws are making to encourage the Wooling Manufactory, this wholly di&s;courages it as to tho&s;e Plantations.</P>
<P N="9">IX. It will engage the Planter to leave off planting Tobacco, and fall in to Manufactories, and to plant Cotten-wool, Hemp and Flax, and breed up Sheep for their Cloathing, which hath in &s;ome mea&s;ure been already attempted, finding that their La|bour in making Tobacco could not cover their Nakedne&s;s. And being once put upon that thoughtfulne&s;s, will in a manner di&s;&s;olve the Trade in Tobacco, &s;o u&s;eful to our Commerce at home and abroad.</P>
<P N="10">X. This heavy Duty will wholly take off the Affections of tho&s;e Plantations from <HI>England,</HI> to &s;ee them&s;elves charged twenty times higher in this Duty than any their Neighbouring Plan|tations for their Growth, which is more profitable to them than Tobacco is to <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Maryland.</HI></P>
<P N="11">XI. And its by late Experience found, that the Import of 3 d. <HI>per</HI> Pound, hath &s;o affected the Planter, that &s;everal Counties in <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Maryland</HI> have abated the planting Tobacco, and fallen into Manufactories of both Linnen and Woollen, to &s;uch a degree, as to give &s;ome Supply to their Neighbouring Coun|ties, and Wool which was four or five Years ago u&s;ele&s;s to them, is now fought after and bought up for 12 d.<HI>per</HI> Pound.</P>
