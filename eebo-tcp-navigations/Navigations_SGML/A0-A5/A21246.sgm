<P>At the top of the Hill going to Bi&s;&s;am, the Cornets &s;ounding in the Woods, a wilde man came forth and vt|tered this &s;peech.</P>
<SP>
<P>_I Followed this &s;ounde, as enchanted; neither knowing the rea&s;on why, nor how to bee ridde of it: vnu&s;uall to the&s;e Woods, and (I feare) to our gods prodigi|ous. <HI>Syluanus</HI> whom I honour, is runne into a Caue: <HI>Pan,</HI> whom I enuye, courting of the Shephear|de&s;&s;e: Enuie I thee <HI>Pan?</HI> No, pitty thee, an eie-&s;ore to cha&s;t Nymphes; yet &s;till importunate: Honour thee <HI>Syluanus?</HI> No, contemne thee: fearefull of Mu&s;icke in the Woods, yet counted the god of the Woods. I, it may bee more &s;tout, than wi&s;e, asked, who pa&s;&s;ed that way? what he or &s;hee? none dur&s;t an&s;were, or would vouch&s;afe, but pa&s;sionate Eccho, who &s;aide Shee. And Shee it is, and you are Shee, whom in our dreames many yeares wee Satyres haue &s;eene, but waking could neuer finde any &s;uch. Euery one hath tolde his dreame and de&s;cribed your per&s;on, all agree in one, and &s;et downe your vertues: in this onely did wee differ, that &s;ome &s;aide your Pourtraiture might be drawen, other &s;aide impo&s;sible: &s;ome thought your vertues might be numbred, mo&s;t &s;aide they were infinite: Infinite, and impo&s;sible, of that &s;ide was I: and fir&s;t in hu|mility to &s;alute you mo&s;t happy I: my vntamed thoughts
<PB REF="3">waxe gentle, &amp; I feele in my &s;elfe ciuility, A thing hated, becau&s;e not knowen, and vnknowen, becau&s;e I knew not you. Thus Vertue tameth fiercene&s;&s;e, Beauty, madne&s;&s;e.

<P>PRety &s;oules and bodies too, faire &s;hephardi&s;&s;e, or &s;weete Mi&s;tre&s;&s;e, you know my &s;uite, loue, my vertue, Mu&s;icke, my power, a godhead. I cannot tickle the &s;heepes gutts of a Lute, bydd, bydd, bydd, like the calling of Chickins, but for a Pipe that &s;queeketh like a Pigg, I am he. How doe you burne time, &amp; drowne beauty in prick|ing of clouts, when you &s;hould bee penning of Sonnets? You are more &s;imple then the &s;heepe you keepe, but not &s;o gentle. I loue you both, I know not which be&s;t, and you both &s;corne me, I know not which mo&s;t. Sure I am, that you are not &s;o young as not to vnder&s;tand loue, nor &s;o wi&s;e as to with&s;tand it, vnle&s;&s;e you think your &s;elues greater tha~ gods, whereof I am one. Howe often haue I brought you Che&s;tnuts for a loue token, &amp; de&s;ired but acceptance for a fauour. Little did you knowe the mi&s;terye, that as the huske was thornye and tough, yet the meate &s;weete, &s;o though my hyde were rough and vnkempt, yet my heart was &s;mooth and louing: you are but the Farmers daughters of the Dale, I the god of the flocks that feede vpon the hils. Though I cannot force loue, I may obedience, or el&s;e &s;ende your &s;heepe a wandring, with my fancies. Coy|ne&s;&s;e mu&s;t be reuenged with cur&s;tne&s;&s;e, but be not aga&s;te &s;weet mice, my godhead co~meth &s;o fa&s;t vpon me, that Ma|ie&s;tye had almo&s;t ouerru~n affectio~, Can you loue?

<P>Nay, this is his meaning; as he hath two &s;hapes, &s;o hath he two harts, the one of a man wherewith his tongue is tipped, di&s;&s;embling; the other of a bea&s;t, wherewith his thoughts are poy&s;oned, lu&s;t.

What our mother hath often tolde vs, and fame the whole world, cannot be concealed from thee; if it be, we wil tell thee, which may hereafter make thee &s;ur|cea&s;e thy &s;uite, for feare of her di&s;plea&s;ure, and honour virginitye, by wondering at her vertues.</P>

<P>This way commeth the Queene of this I&s;lande, the wonder of the world, and natures glory, leading affections in fetters, Virginities &s;laues: embracing mildnes with Iu|&s;tice, Maie&s;ties twinns. In whom nature hath imprinted beauty, not art paynted it; in whome wit hath bred lear|ning, but not without labour; labour brought forth wi&s;e|dome, but not without wonder. By her it is <HI>(Pan)</HI> that all our Carttes that thou &s;ee&s;t, are laden vvith Corne, when in other countries they are filled vvith Harneys, that our hor&s;es are ledde vvith a whipp: theirs vvith a Launce, that our Riuers flow with fi&s;h, theirs with bloode: our cattel feede on pa&s;tures, they feede on pa&s;tures like cattel: One hande &s;he &s;tretcheth to <HI>Fraunce,</HI> to weaken Rebels; the other to <HI>Flaunders,</HI> to &s;trengthen Religion; her heart to both Countries, her vertues to all. This is &s;hee at whom <HI>Enuie</HI> hath &s;hott all her arrowes, and now for anger broke her bow, on whom God hath laide all his ble&s;&s;inges, &amp; we for ioy clappe our hands, heedle&s;&s;e trea&s;on goeth hed|le&s;&s;e; and clo&s;e trechery re&s;tle&s;&s;e: Daunger looketh pale to beholde her Maie&s;ty; &amp; tyranny blu&s;heth to heare of her mercy. <HI>Iupiter</HI> came into the hou&s;e of poore <HI>Baucis,</HI> &amp; &s;he vouch&s;afeth to vi&s;ite the bare Farmes of her &s;ubiects. We vpo~ our knees, wil entreat her to come into the valley, that our hou&s;es may be ble&s;&s;ed with her pre&s;ence, who&s;e hartes are filled with quietnes by her gouernement. To her wee wi&s;h as many yeares, as our fieldes haue eares of
<PB REF="4">corne, both infinite: and to her enemies, as many troubles, as the Wood hath leaues, all intollerable. But whi&s;t, here &s;hee is, run downe <HI>Pan</HI> the hill in all ha&s;t, and though thou breake thy necke to giue our mother warning, it is no matter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, giue me leaue to die with wondring, &amp; trippe you to your mother. Here I yeelde all the flockes of the&s;e fields to your highnes: greene be the gra&s;&s;e where you treade: calme the water where you rowe: &s;weete the aire, where you breathe: long the life that you liue, happy the people that you loue: this is all I can wi&s;h. During your a|bode, no theft &s;halbe in the woods: in the fielde no noi&s;e, in the vallies no &s;pies, my &s;elfe will keepe all &s;afe: that is all I can offer. And heare I breake my pipe, which <HI>Apollo</HI> could neuer make me doe; and follow that &s;ounde which followes you.</P>

<P>THat my &s;onnes, haue remembred their dueties, it is my harts comfort, that your Maie&s;tie accepteth the~, their harts heauen. If fortune, &amp; fidelitie had bin twinnes,
<PB REF="12">they might haue beene as rich, as faithfull, but this is the Iubyle of my life, that their faithes, are without &s;pot, and your Maie&s;ty I hope, confident, without &s;u&s;pition. Among my ioies, there is one griefe, that my daughter, the Mi&s;tris of a Moole hil, hath &s;o much forgotte~; that mo&s;t &s;he &s;hould remember, duetie. I doubt not her excu&s;e, becau&s;e &s;hee is a woman, but feare the truth, of it, becau&s;e it mu&s;t be to her &s;oueraigne. For my &s;elfe, my crowe, and all our birds, this I promi&s;e, that they are all; as faithfull in their feathers, as they were in their &s;hels.</P>
</SP>
<P><HI>This being done, there was &s;wcete mu&s;icke, and two &s;onnets which ended, her Maie&s;ty went in.</HI></P>
<P>On mu~day morning, as her Maie&s;ty was to take hor&s;e, a me&s;&s;enger, comming out of Ier&s;ey, and bringing a Day&s;ie of golde, &s;et with Rubies, deliuered it to her Maie&s;ty with this &s;peech.</P>
<SP>
<P>AT length, though verie late, I am come, from the La|die of the Moold hill, &s;ent long &s;ince, but the pa&s;&s;age trouble&s;ome, at euerie miles end, a louer, at euery &s;entence end a lie, I &s;taide to heare, the conclu&s;ions, and found nut|browne gyrles to be cheapned. But none to be bought, but the amyable. Thus much for my excu&s;e, now for my Mi|&s;tris, who hearing that your Maie&s;ty would enter this cab|bine, was a&s;toni&s;hed, with ioie, and doubt, ioie, for &s;o great honour done to her father. Doubt, by what meanes &s;hee might &s;hew her duety to your Maie&s;ty. At the la&s;t, &s;itting vpon the top of a moole hill, &s;he e&s;pied, a red Day&s;ie, the faire&s;t flower, that barren place doth yeeld, which, with all humilitie &s;he pre&s;ents to your Maie&s;tie, it hath no &s;weete|nes, yet manie vertues, her hart no tongue, but infinite af|fections, In you &s;he &s;aith are all vertues, and towardes you all her affections.</P>
