<HEAD>To Mon&s;ieur
William de Schuylenburg,
LORD of Dukenburg,
Coun&s;ellor, and Clerk of the Council
TO HIS
BRITANNIC MAJESTY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have taken the Liberty to offer
you a Pre&s;ent which perhaps
will &s;urprize you; for we are ge|nerally
po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with an Opinion
that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for the &s;ame Per|&s;on
to manage both a <HI>Sword</HI> and a
<HI>Pen.</HI> If I had the lea&s;t Inclination
to pretend to the Quality of an <HI>Au|thor,</HI>
I wou'd endeavour to demon&s;trate
the &V;nrea&s;onablene&s;s of that Preju|dice;
nor do I believe that I &s;hou'd
find it a very difficult Task to perform.
<PB REF="3">
I cou'd ea&s;ily tran&s;cribe the Stories of
&s;o many famous <HI>Captains</HI> who were e|qually
remarkable for their <HI>Wit</HI> and
for their <HI>Valour;</HI> and di&s;play'd the
former in their <HI>Writings</HI> with as much
Honour and Succe&s;s as they &s;ignaliz'd
the latter in the mo&s;t dangerous <HI>Bat|tles:</HI>
And from the&s;e In&s;tances I wou'd
conclude that the neare&s;t and mo&s;t di|rect
Way to Glory is to follow the bright
Tracts of tho&s;e <HI>Illu&s;trious Heroes.</HI>
But &s;ince the Pro&s;ecution of &s;o noble
an Attempt wou'd require a larger
Stock of Merit and Abilities than ever
I cou'd boa&s;t of, I will not be guilty of
&s;o much Vanity as to alledge tho&s;e <HI>Ex|amples</HI>
in my own Vindication. Nor
will I trouble You with any &s;tudy'd or
formal <HI>Apology,</HI> &s;ince I'm confident
You will be ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to forgive
my Boldne&s;s in pre&s;enting You with
the Ob&s;ervations I made during
my <HI>Travels,</HI> which I thought I might
communicate to the Publick without in|vading
the Province, or provoking the
Jealou&s;ie of <HI>Men of Letters.</HI> I made
<PB REF="3">
it my Recreation for &s;ome Weeks to pre|pare
'em for the Pre&s;s, and &s;hall be &s;a|tisfy'd
if they can furni&s;h You with any
tolerable Entertainment for &s;ome Hours.
Your <HI>Approbation</HI> is all the Glory,
and the highe&s;t Recompence I de&s;ire.
'Tis true, I cannot ask &s;o noble a Re|ward
without di&s;covering the Boldne&s;s
of my Ambition; for you have &s;o nice
a Ta&s;te, and &s;o exact a Judgment,
that you never be&s;tow that Favour but
on &s;uch as merit Applau&s;e from all the
World. But I encourage my &s;elf with
reflecting on that <HI>Goodne&s;s</HI> which is
&s;o natural and peculiar to You, and
even pre&s;ume to hope that the Sweet|ne&s;s
of Your Temper will put a fa|vourable
Bias upon Your Judgment,
and incline You to excu&s;e, or at lea&s;t
to over-look my <HI>Errors.</HI> This, <HI>SIR,</HI>
is the only Favour I beg leave to de|&s;ire;
for I never entertain'd a Thought
of courting Your <HI>Protection</HI> on the
Score of &s;o mean a Pre&s;ent. I know
that mu&s;t be obtain'd by a very diffe|rent
Method; nor do I hope to procure
<PB REF="4">
it by any other Way than that by
which all <HI>Good Men</HI> who have the
Happine&s;s to be known to you, may
pretend to it. 'Tis from Your <HI>Genero|&s;ity</HI>
alone that I expect &s;o glorious an
Advantage, and from that compa&s;&s;ionate
and bountiful Inclination, which has
render'd You the Support of &s;o many
<HI>Illu&s;trious Exiles,</HI> whom the Tempe&s;t
of the Age has ca&s;t upon the Shores
of <HI>Holland,</HI> where, by Your Favour,
they have found not only a Safe but a
Peaceful and Convenient Retreat, and
are enabl'd to out-live the Lo&s;s of all
their Hopes and Fortunes. Since then
a Man of Honour may a&s;&s;ure him&s;elf
of Your <HI>Protection</HI> without being ob|lig'd
to bribe Your Favour, I might
be ju&s;tly accus'd both of Folly and In|ju&s;tice
if I &s;hou'd endeavour to obtain
it by indirect Methods. No, <HI>Sir,</HI> I
never harbour'd &s;o criminal a Thought;
and the only rea&s;on why I make bold to
con&s;ecrate the Fruit of my <HI>Travels</HI> to
You, is becau&s;e this <HI>Dedication</HI> will
furni&s;h me with an Opportunity to ac|knowledge
<PB REF="4">
the va&s;t Debt I owe You.
The Iniquity of Fortune made me in|capable
of expre&s;&s;ing the Sen&s;e I have
of Your Goodne&s;s; and I can a&s;&s;ure
You, that Con&s;ideration alone &s;ate hea|vier
upon me than all the re&s;t of my
Di&s;a&s;ters. And is it not natural for a
Man in &s;uch a Condition to embrace
the fir&s;t Occa&s;ion he can meet with of
&s;atisfying in &s;ome Mea&s;ure the extreme
De&s;ire he has to expre&s;s his <HI>Gratitude?</HI>
Permit me then to acknowledge that I
have receiv'd very con&s;iderable Favours
from You, that You be&s;tow'd 'em in
the mo&s;t obliging Manner imaginable,
that I never merited 'em, that You
cou'd not have the lea&s;t Rea&s;on to
believe that ever I cou'd requite 'em,
and con&s;equently that You were only
acted by a Principle of <HI>doing Good,</HI>
without the lea&s;t hope of a <HI>Return.</HI>
This, <HI>Sir,</HI> is what I de&s;ire to publi&s;h
to all the World; this is the only Mo|tive
that incited me to prefix this Let|ter
to tho&s;e which You will find in the
Body of the Treati&s;e; and to convince
<PB REF="5">
You that I had no other De&s;ign in my View,
I &s;hall pnrpo&s;ely avoid the u&s;ual Strain of <HI>De|dications,</HI>
and &s;ave You the trouble of read|ing
tho&s;e Prai&s;es which Your <HI>Merit</HI> chal|lenges
from all the World, and Your <HI>Mode|&s;ty</HI>
will not receive even from Your be&s;t
Friends. 'Tis not without extreme Reluctan|cy
that I decline &s;o inviting a Subject; and
I had almo&s;t made bold to tell You, that You
were oblig'd to me for my <HI>Silence.</HI> You
know what a va&s;t Field lies before me, and
with how much Plea&s;ure and Satisfaction I
wou'd have made U&s;e of this Opportunity to
acquaint the World with Your unalterable Love
to Your Country, Your inviolable Fidelity to the
State, Your Zeal and Affection to His Ma|je&s;ty's
Service, Your extraordinary Abilities and
Capacity for the Management of tho&s;e impor|tant
Affairs that are intru&s;ted to Your Care;
the Clearne&s;s and Quickne&s;s of Your Apprehen|&s;ion,
the Solidity of Your Judgment, Your
uncommon Genero&s;ity, the charming Sweetne&s;s
of Your Temper, Your incorruptible Probity,
and all the other eminent Vertues and Endow|ments,
which hath gain'd You the E&s;teem and
Admiration of all the World. 'Twou'd be an
<PB REF="5">
endle&s;s Task to mention all tho&s;e rare aud no|ble
Qualities which have &s;o ju&s;tly intitl'd You
to the Favour of the <HI>greate&s;t King</HI> in the
World. But I mu&s;t not forget my Promi&s;e,
and therefore &s;hall content my &s;elf with ad|miring
you in Silence, after I have begg'd
Leave to a&s;&s;ure You that I am, and &s;hall ever

<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Cu&s;tom of Writing <HI>Prefaces</HI> has
been &s;o long e&s;tabli&s;h'd, and is grown
&s;o common, that what was former|ly
look'd upon as a <HI>Courte&s;ie,</HI> is now
reckon'd a <HI>Duty:</HI> and if the <HI>Reader</HI> be not
coax'd into good Humour, he thinks him&s;elf
engag'd in Honour to re&s;ent the Affront, and
the <HI>Book</HI> mu&s;t be damn'd for the Clown|i&s;hne&s;s
of the <HI>Author.</HI> But tho' I dare not
venture to &s;end this <HI>Treati&s;e</HI> abroad without
&s;o nece&s;&s;ary an Ornament, I mu&s;t confe&s;s I'm
&s;omewhat puzzl'd how to begin my Addre&s;s.
'Tis true, I might pretend a Right (and per|haps
as ju&s;tly too as many others) to that
thread-bare Excu&s;e of common <HI>Scriblers;</HI> that
neither my Humour, nor Profe&s;&s;ion inclines
me to &s;et up for an <HI>Author,</HI> that this <HI>Treati&s;e</HI>
was compos'd and de&s;ign'd for my own pri|vate
U&s;e, that I happen'd to &s;hew it to &s;ome
Friends, and was at la&s;t con&s;train'd by their
perpetual and re&s;i&s;tle&s;s Importunities, to con|&s;ent
to its Publication. But tho' I &s;hou'd
&s;poil my Compliment to the <HI>Reader,</HI> I will
neither endeavour to court his Favour, nor
&s;ave my Credit by a <HI>Lie:</HI> that is, I will not
<PB REF="7">
pretend that I was either forc'd or per&s;waded
to a thing which I cho&s;e for a Diver&s;ion in
my <HI>Winter-Quarters,</HI> where I &s;pent my time
in revi&s;ing and putting in Order the Notes
I had taken during my Travels. As to the
Method I have ob&s;erv'd in communicating
my Ob&s;ervations, be&s;ides other Advantages 'tis
certainly mo&s;t convenient for a Man of my
Profe&s;&s;ion. One that is not accu&s;tom'd to
Writing, expre&s;&s;es his Thoughts more
ea&s;ily in <HI>familiar Letters</HI> than in a <HI>continu'd
Di&s;cour&s;e:</HI> for he is neither acquainted with
the Niceties of a correct <HI>Style,</HI> nor able to pre|&s;erve
an exact <HI>&V;niformity</HI> and <HI>Connexion</HI> in &s;o
great a Variety of Matter.</P>
<P>'Twou'd be a difficult and laborious Task
to an&s;wer all the <HI>Objections</HI> that may be made
again&s;t this Work: And therefore &s;ince I am
not naturally over-fond of making Apologies,
I'm re&s;olv'd to let it go at a venture, and
take its Fate among the <HI>Criticks,</HI> without gi|ving
my &s;elf the Trouble to con&s;ider, much
le&s;s to prevent or confute their Cen&s;ures. How|ever
it mu&s;t be acknowledg'd, that 'tis the
De&s;ign of all Authors, and mine in particu|lar,
to <HI>plea&s;e,</HI> and therefore it will not be im|proper
to be &s;peak the <HI>Reader</HI>'s Favour, &s;ince he
mu&s;t &s;hortly become my <HI>Judge:</HI> and I may
ju&s;tly de&s;ire to be <HI>heard</HI> before my <HI>Doom</HI> be
pronounc'd.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, I expect to be cen&s;ur'd
for writing on a <HI>Subject</HI> which has been al|ready
handl'd by &s;o many Learned and In|qui&s;itive
<HI>Travellers,</HI> and &s;eems to be quite <HI>ex|hau&s;ted</HI>
<PB REF="7">
by the va&s;t Number of <HI>Relations</HI> with
which they have oblig'd the Public. In An|&s;wer
to this Objection, I might content my
&s;elf with de&s;iring the <HI>Reader</HI> to con&s;ult the
<HI>Prefaces</HI> of tho&s;e Authors who have treated
on the &s;ame Subject; but without giving him
the Trouble of peru&s;ing their <HI>Rea&s;ons,</HI> I can
a&s;&s;ure him, that in the following <HI>Letters</HI> he
will meet with &s;everal <HI>Ob&s;ervations</HI> that are
omitted by other <HI>Travellers.</HI> I made it my
principal Bu&s;ine&s;s to ob&s;erve the <HI>Manners</HI> and
<HI>Cu&s;toms</HI> of the <HI>People,</HI> which are &s;ubject to
frequent and con&s;iderable Alterations; and
con&s;equently I may, without Vanity, affirm,
that my <HI>Remarks</HI> will furni&s;h the <HI>Reader</HI> with
a fre&s;her, and more diverting Entertainment,
than the dry <HI>Relations</HI> of a meer <HI>Antiquary</HI> or
<HI>Geographer.</HI> Neither is the Subject &s;o barren nor
&s;o much exhau&s;ted, as the <HI>Objection</HI> &s;uppo&s;es, and
we commonly imagine it to be. A hundred Au|thors
have handl'd it before me, and in all Pro|bability
a hundred more will treat of it after
me. But almo&s;t every Writer pur&s;ues a dif|ferent
Method, and takes Notice of &s;ome
Things that were neglected by others: and
tho' I have related nothing but what I have
&s;een or heard, I &s;hall be always glad to per|u&s;e
the <HI>Writings</HI> of &s;ucceeding <HI>Travellers,</HI> and
may perhaps find &s;everal con&s;iderable Re|marks
in their <HI>Relations</HI> that had e&s;cap'd my
own Ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>'Tis true there are &s;ome Things &s;o particu|larly
de&s;crib'd in the Relations of other <HI>Tra|vellers,</HI>
that I cho&s;e rather to omit many beau|ful
<PB REF="8">
<HI>De&s;criptions</HI> with which I might have em|belli&s;h'd
my <HI>Work,</HI> than to tran&s;cribe or re|peat
the <HI>Ob&s;ervations</HI> that are already com|municated
to the Public. As for Example;
what cou'd I have added to the exact Ac|count
of the <HI>Roman Pantheon, Capitol, Colli|&s;eum,</HI>
&amp;c. of the <HI>Palace</HI> of S. <HI>Mark</HI> at <HI>Venice,</HI>
of the <HI>Great Council,</HI> and a thou&s;and other
Things of that Nature? 'Twill perhaps be
objected, that for the &s;ame Rea&s;on I ought
to have omitted &s;everal other De&s;criptions,
which I have taken care to in&s;ert in my <HI>Let|ters;</HI>
but to remove that Prejudice 'twill be
&s;ufficient to put the <HI>Reader</HI> in mind that there
is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary a <HI>Connexion</HI> between my <HI>Old</HI>
and <HI>New</HI> Ob&s;ervations, that I cou'd not po&s;&s;i|bly
mention the <HI>latter,</HI> without taking Notice
of the <HI>former.</HI> 'Tis true, I cannot pretend
the &s;ame Excu&s;e for that part of my Book,
where I treat of the <HI>Egyptian Pyramids,</HI> of
<HI>Cairo,</HI> and the Ruines of <HI>Alexandria:</HI> But
there is &s;omething &s;o wonderful and &s;urpri|zing
in tho&s;e Celebrated Monuments of An|tiquity,
that I concluded the curious <HI>Reader</HI>
wou'd be glad of an Opportunity to refre&s;h
his Memory by Reading the <HI>Two Letters</HI> I
have written on that <HI>Subject:</HI> and as for
tho&s;e who are already &s;o well acquainted
with the&s;e <HI>Curio&s;ities,</HI> that they cannot im|ploy
their Time with Plea&s;ure in Reading a
New Account of 'em, they may ea&s;ily &s;ave
them&s;elves that Trouble, by skipping over
Ten or Twelve Leaves.</P>
<P><PB REF="8">
The &s;ame An&s;wer may &s;erve for tho&s;e who
win <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> apt to cen&s;ure me for in&s;erting in my
Two <HI>fir&s;t Letters,</HI> an Abridgment of the <HI>Cam|pagne</HI>
in <HI>Germany</HI> in 1689. and of the <HI>Barbarities</HI>
that were committed by the <HI>French</HI> in that
Country. And be&s;ides, I mu&s;t beg Leave to tell
tho&s;e Gentlemen, that &s;everal Men of Sen&s;e
are of a very different Opinion, and e&s;teem
that an <HI>Ornament,</HI> which they perhaps may
reckon a <HI>Fault.</HI></P>
<P>I cou'd ea&s;ily di&s;patch &s;uch <HI>nibbling Criticks</HI>
if I were not afraid of being attack'd by
more <HI>formidable Adver&s;aries,</HI> who will ab&s;o|lutely
condemn all tho&s;e little <HI>Stories</HI> which
I thought fit to in&s;ert in my <HI>Work;</HI> either to
give the <HI>Reader</HI> a clearer and more compre|hen&s;ive
<HI>Idea</HI> of the <HI>Genius</HI> and <HI>Cu&s;toms</HI> of the
<HI>People</HI> of whom I have occa&s;ion to di&s;cour&s;e, or
for &s;ome other Rea&s;ons that need not be menti|on'd.
Since I mu&s;t expect to be treated with
the utmo&s;t Rigour and Spite by &s;uch peevi&s;h
and mercile&s;s Cen&s;urers; I do not think my &s;elf
oblig'd either to &s;ubmit to their Judgment, or
to appea&s;e their Anger. And therefore I &s;hall
content my &s;elf with telling 'em plainly, that
they may lay a&s;ide my <HI>Book,</HI> when they meet
with any Thing in it that offends 'em, and that
I &s;hall be equally unconcern'd whether they
<HI>approve</HI> or <HI>condemn</HI> it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Reader</HI> may ea&s;ily perceive, that I de|&s;ign'd
not to have ended my <HI>Relation</HI> at <HI>Ve|nice.</HI>
I thought, in a <HI>Second Part,</HI> to have given
an Account of <HI>Germany, Holland,</HI> and <HI>Flan|ders:</HI>
but the time of Staying in our <HI>Winter-Quarters</HI>
<PB REF="9">
being expir'd, I was oblig'd to quit
my <HI>Clo&s;et</HI> for the <HI>Field,</HI> before I had fini&s;h'd
my intended Work. In the mean time, if
the <HI>Fir&s;t Part</HI> meet with an encouraging Re|ception,
the <HI>Second</HI> &s;hall be completed next
<HI>Winter;</HI> if not, I mu&s;t e'en take my Re&s;t, or
find out &s;ome other Employment; for I ne|ver
was, nor will be of an Humour to cloy
the Public with my Writings.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I mu&s;t beg leave to complain of the hardne&s;s
of the Task you impo&s;e upon me, by requi|ring
me to give you an exact Relation of
our pre&s;ent Campaign, with the De&s;cription
of tho&s;e Cities in <HI>Germany</HI> which I &s;hall have oc|ca&s;ion
to vi&s;it; but neither the Trouble&s;omne&s;s of
&s;uch a Corre&s;pondence, nor the Sence of my own
Unfitne&s;s to Manage it, &s;hall make me decline an
Undertaking by which I may convince you of
my extream de&s;ire to obtain the honour of your
Friend&s;hip, and to &s;ecure my &s;elf in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of it beyond the danger or fear of any future
Alteration.</P>
<P>I &s;hall begin, then, with acquainting you, that
we were about eight Days ago quarter'd in a
City call'd <HI>Spire,</HI> which is now a heap of Stones:
<PB N="2" REF="17">
The Inhabitants have been threaten'd the&s;e three
Months, with the execution of that fatal De&s;ign
of reducing the City to A&s;hes, and during that
time liv'd in a cruel Uncertainty, and perpetual
Fear of their impending Ruine. <HI>Spire</HI> was &s;itua|ted
in the <HI>Palatinate</HI> of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> call'd of old <HI>Ni|metum,</HI>
and its Inhabitants <HI>Nimetes;</HI> it was the
Seat of the Imperial Chamber, compos'd of two
Pre&s;idents, one a <HI>Catholick,</HI> and the other a <HI>Prote|&s;tant;</HI>
and fifteen Coun&s;ellors, eight of the <HI>Ro|mi&s;h,</HI>
and &s;even of the other Per&s;ua&s;ion. The E|lector
of <HI>Triers</HI> held the Bi&s;hoprick of that City,
the Sovereignty of which is extended over &s;eve|ral
fine Territories; and among the re&s;t, <HI>Philipsburg,</HI>
which the Emperor was oblig'd to re&s;tore to that
Prelate, by the Treaty concluded with <HI>France</HI> at
<HI>Triers,</HI> in 1685. The Cathedral was a large and
fine Structure, well furni&s;h'd with Lights, and a|dorn'd
with great Pyramidal Towers at the four
Corners. On the Right-&s;ide of the Church &s;tood
the Epi&s;copal Palace, famous for its Architecture,
and enrich'd on the In&s;ide with a great variety of
fine Pictures; and on the other &s;ide was the Hou&s;e
of the Canons, with a very ancient Cloy&s;ter, in
the middle of which there was a Mount of O|lives
cut in the Rock, e&s;teem'd to be a Ma|&s;ter-piece
of Sculpture. Before the Church there
was a great Court or void Space, capable of con|taining
10000 Men drawn up in <HI>Battalia.</HI> All
the Hou&s;es that &s;urrounded it were well built,
e&s;pecially that of the <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> which fronted the
Bi&s;hop's Palace, where tho&s;e Fathers had a very
curious Library of above 6000 Volumes, which
was con&s;um'd in the general Conflagration of
the City; with five or &s;ix others belonging to
private Per&s;ons that were no le&s;s con&s;iderable.
The Inhabitants of <HI>Spire</HI> were Rich, and lovers of
Plea&s;ure: The City was &s;urrounded with a great
<PB N="3" REF="17">
number of Gardens abundantly furni&s;h'd with eve|ry
thing that might contribute to the Advantage
and Plea&s;ure of the Owners; for be&s;ides the Beau|ty
of the Orange-Trees which were pre&s;erv'd there
notwith&s;tanding the Coldne&s;s of the Climate; and
the various Ornaments of cover'd and open'd
Walks, Flowers, Water-Works, and Statues; there
was a great abundance of all &s;orts of Fruit-Trees.
Every Garden had al&s;o the convenience of a Plea|&s;ure-Hou&s;e,
very hand&s;omly built, and all over
Painted and Gilt after the <HI>German</HI> Fa&s;hion, in which
the Gentlemen of <HI>Spire</HI> pa&s;s'd the time with a great
deal of Satisfaction, &s;ome in Drinking, and others
in more charming Diver&s;ions. The Town-Hou&s;e
was famous for its Antiquity, which was &s;aid to
amount to above twelve Ages &s;ince its fir&s;t Foun|dation,
but had nothing el&s;e to recommend it
to the Ob&s;ervation of Travellers. Before the
Gate there hung on an Iron-Ring, a <HI>Bone of an Arm,</HI>
which equall'd a Thigh-Bone in bigne&s;s, and
was proportionably long. 'Tis affirm'd in the
Records of the City, that the Man to whom that
Bone belong'd, who&s;e Name was <HI>Olps,</HI> was twen|ty
five Foot high, and that he was kill'd about
1300 Years agoe in a Siege again&s;t the Town,
the Ladder breaking under him as he was &s;caling
the Walls; which gave a fair Opportunity to the
Be&s;ieg'd to rid them&s;elves of &s;o formidable an E|nemy,
by pouring whole Hog&s;heads of boiling
Pitch upon him. His Hip-Bone was al&s;o pre&s;er|ved
in the great Hall, which I have often &s;een,
without giving much credit to the Story; for
tis hard to conceive, that a Man of &s;uch a Gi|gantine
Stature cou'd have e&s;cap'd the Ob&s;rvati|on
of Hi&s;torians.</P>
<P>To return to <HI>Spire;</HI> The City was taken by
the <HI>Dauphin</HI> about the end of the la&s;t Year,
(when he made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of <HI>Philipsburg</HI>)
<PB N="4" REF="18">
and was immediately put under Contribution;
and be&s;ides, 6000 Men were quarter'd in it during
the Winter, which made the Inhabitants believe
they had already &s;uffer'd the &s;evere&s;t Effects of
their Enemies Fury. But they were extremely
&s;urpriz'd, when in the la&s;t Spring they were com|manded
to rai&s;e 60000 Crowns, under pain of
Burning. This rigorous Order cou'd not be exe|cuted
without reducing 'em to Beggary; for
Money was already very &s;carce in the City,
and yet tho&s;e Wretches put them&s;elves to the ut|mo&s;t
&s;tretch to rai&s;e the Summ; which they had
no &s;ooner paid, but the Baron <HI>de Monclair</HI> caus'd
a Proclamation to be publi&s;h'd with Sound of
Trumpet, commanding all the Inhabitants to re|tire
with their Goods, becau&s;e the Town was to
be burnt on the 5<HI>th.</HI> Day after the publi&s;hing of
the Order. And to add to the Cruelty of their
Puni&s;hment, they were not &s;uffer'd to pa&s;s the
<HI>Rhine,</HI> where they might have found &s;ome A&s;&s;i|&s;tance
among their Friends and Relations, but
were forc'd to retire to <HI>Al&s;ace,</HI> among the <HI>French,</HI>
who treated them like &s;o many Bea&s;ts, without
the lea&s;t Mark of Humanity or Compa&s;&s;ion. Af|ter
all the&s;e Severities, they might have found
&s;ome Con&s;olation even in the extremity of their
Affliction, if they had been furni&s;h'd with Wag|gons
for the Tran&s;portation of their Goods; but
they were not to expect the lea&s;t Favour, and were
oblig'd to hire Waggons of the Pea&s;ants and Sut|lers,
who, taking Advantage of their Nece&s;&s;ity,
made 'em pay &s;uch exce&s;&s;ive Rates, that they were
forc'd to leave the greate&s;t part of their Goods
for want of Carriage. In that time of Extremity
I heard &s;ome of tho&s;e mi&s;erable Creatures offer
fifteen Crowns a-day for the u&s;e of a Hor&s;e,
that might have been bought for a &s;maller
Summ. Never any Man beheld &s;o touching an
<PB N="5" REF="18">
Object as was occa&s;ion'd by the Grief and Con|&s;ternation
that cover'd every Face in this unfortu|nate
City, at the publi&s;hing of the Burning-Or|der.
Our Eyes and Ears were every where &s;alu|ted
with Tears and Lamentations; the Women
e&s;pecially mov'd the harde&s;t Hearts with Com|pa&s;&s;ion,
their De&s;pair making 'em tear their
Hair, and &s;trike their Heads again&s;t the Wall.</P>
<P>At la&s;t the fatal Term being expir'd, they
were forc'd to bid a la&s;ting Farewel to the
City, and with it to almo&s;t all their Goods and
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. Then their Lamentations began afre&s;h,
and their De&s;pair appear'd more vi&s;ibly than e|ver;
nor was it po&s;&s;ible for any Heart that was
not entirely dive&s;ted of all &s;ence of Humanity,
to re&s;i&s;t the Motions of Compa&s;&s;ion that were
excited at the &s;ight of &s;o deplorable an Object.
Noblemen, Trade&s;men, the Poor and the Rich,
began their doleful March, without any Mark
of Di&s;tinction, all equally Mi&s;erable; with this
only difference, that the Rich were more &s;en&s;i|ble
of their Misfortunes than tho&s;e who&s;e Po|verty
&s;ecur'd 'em from the danger of con&s;idera|ble
Lo&s;&s;es. I'm &s;till fill'd with Horrour as often
as I reflect on that di&s;mal Spectacle; and I'm
confident you wou'd not be le&s;s deeply touch'd
with a &s;ence of the irrecoverable Ruine of &s;o
many innocent Per&s;ons, if you had been an Eye-Witne&s;s
of it. You cou'd not have beheld, with|out
feeling almo&s;t the &s;ame Tran&s;ports of Sor|row,
two or three hundred Noble-women and
Citizens Wives walking on foot in the mid&s;t of an
Infinite Crowd of People, and mo&s;t of 'em fol|low'd
by five or &s;ix &s;mall Children, &s;ome of 'em
hanging at the Mother's Brea&s;t, not knowing
where to &s;helter them&s;elves during the Night,
nor where to find nece&s;&s;ary Refre&s;hment and
Su&s;tenance for their weary'd Bodies; for the ex|ce&s;&s;ive
<PB N="6" REF="19">
Contributions that were exacted from 'em,
had &s;o drain'd their Pur&s;es, that three quarters of
'em were not Ma&s;ters of one Peny; and tho&s;e
who had the happine&s;s to pre&s;erve the Remain|ders
of their Money, had hid it under-ground,
for fear of being robb'd by the Soldiers on the
Road, as &s;everal of 'em were who had not us'd
that Precaution.</P>
<P>After their Departure, the Town was abandon'd
for two Days to the Mercy of the Soldiers, who
committed a Thou&s;and Sacrileges; for hoping to
find &s;ome hidden Trea&s;ures, they threw down the
Altars, dig'd up dead Bodies, and rif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">d the mo&s;t
Ancient and Venerable Tombs, without &s;paring
tho&s;e of an Emperour, and &s;everal great Princes
and Prelates that were in the Cathedral, which
they turn'd to a Stable.</P>
<P>After all the&s;e Violences, the appointed Day
for the final de&s;truction of the City being come,
the Troops were encampt, and 200 Men, each
with a lighted Torch in his Hand, were Com|manded
to &s;et fire to the Hou&s;es; &s;o that in le&s;s
than half a Day the Town was entirely con&s;um'd,
and the la&s;t Day of <HI>May</HI> 1689, was the la&s;t of
that Ancient City. And le&s;t the Fire &s;hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d be
too merciful, the King order'd it to be after|wards
demoli&s;h'd, and 1000 Soldiers are actually
employ'd in levelling it with the Ground. They
will find &s;ome difficulty in executing their Fu|ry
on the great Church, by rea&s;on of the unu|&s;ual
thickne&s;s of the Walls, which are all built
of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ewn Stone; yet the &s;trength of that noble
Edifice cannot prevent its Ruine; for le&s;t the
<HI>Germans</HI> &s;hou'd afterwards lodge them&s;elves in it,
'tis re&s;olv'd to blow it up with a Mine. The Hou&s;e
of the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> re&s;i&s;ted all the Endeavours of the
Demoli&s;hers for two or three Days; but they
were well paid for their Labour with two Trea&s;ures

which they found, one of 8000 Livres of coin'd
Silver, hidden under-ground; and the other, which
probably belong'd to &s;ome Citizens, who had in|tru&s;ted
it to tho&s;e Reverend Fathers, con&s;i&s;ting of
Plate to the Value of 9 or 10000 Francks, in Iron
Coffers, lying under a heap of Books. You wou'd
hardly give Credit to my Relation, if I &s;hou'd
undertake to give you a particular Account of
the prodigious quantity of Wine that was wa&s;ted on
this Occa&s;ion; for there was a &s;ufficient Store of
that Liquor in <HI>Spire</HI> to furni&s;h &s;uch a City as
<HI>Paris</HI> above a Month: And be&s;ides, it was of
the mo&s;t excellent &s;orts, all near eight Years old
at lea&s;t; and even &s;ome of the riche&s;t Citizens
u&s;ually kept it twelve Years, pre&s;erving it in large
Casks, many of which contain'd 100 Hog&s;heads.
I'm per&s;uaded that no other City in the World
cou'd boa&s;t of &s;o fine and &s;o numerous Cellars,
as <HI>Spire;</HI> they were deep, large, and well vault|ed
with great Pillars that &s;u&s;tain'd the whole
weight of the Hou&s;es and Streets; &s;o that they
&s;eem'd to be Subterraneous Temples, con&s;ecrated
to the God <HI>Bacchus.</HI> The Citizen with whom I
lodg'd had a very &s;tately one, which contain'd
100 Casks, &s;uch as tho&s;e I have already de&s;crib'd,
full of the mo&s;t excellent &s;orts of Wine. I never
vi&s;ited this well-&s;tor'd Cellar, but I thought on
our dear <HI>N</HI>&mdash;, and wi&s;h'd his Company, plea|&s;ing
my &s;elf with the Thought, how nobly I
cou'd have regal'd him, e&s;pecially with one Cask
of Wine fifteen Years old, that was highly pri|zed
by all my Friends, tho', for my part, I mu&s;t
confe&s;s, that <HI>Champagne</HI> is infinitely more agree|able
to me; and I willingly leave all tho&s;e Gro&s;s-body'd
Wines to the <HI>Germans,</HI> who&s;e Heads are
&s;trong enough to bear 'em. My Landlord, M. <HI>Creps,</HI>
was a very rich Man, he had very fine Hou&s;es
at <HI>Worms, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ranckendal,</HI> and <HI>Spire,</HI> be&s;ides a &s;mall

Office in the Imperial Chamber, which in all
yielded him above 15000 Livres a Year, yet by
a deplorable Turn of Fortune, he lo&s;t his whole
E&s;tate in le&s;s than three Months, and is fall'n &s;o
extremely poor, that he is forc'd at pre&s;ent to
&s;ell Brandy in our Army, and re&s;olves to con|tinue
that Trade during the re&s;t of the Cam|pagne.</P>
<P>While we are bu&s;i'd in demoli&s;hing <HI>Spire,</HI> the
Queen's Regiment, and &s;ome others, are employ'd
in the &s;ame Exerci&s;e at <HI>Manheim,</HI> a &s;mall City
built by <HI>Charles Lewis,</HI> Elector Palatine, who had
the conveniency of contriving the Fortifications
as he pleas'd. All the Hou&s;es were exactly uni|form,
and the four Gates might be &s;een at once
from the Place of Arms in the mid&s;t of the
Town. This was &s;o important and advantage|ous
a Po&s;t, that Mon&s;ieur <HI>Vauban</HI> &s;aid one Day
to the King, That whatever Prince was Ma&s;ter
of <HI>Manheim</HI> and <HI>Philipsburg,</HI> might at once main|tain
a War again&s;t his Maje&s;ty and the Empe|rour.
The Barone&s;s of <HI>Aiguenfeld,</HI> the &s;econd

was buri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d in this City: And our Soldiers
not only broke open her Tomb, but threw her
Bones without the Walls. The Dutche&s;s of <HI>Or|leans</HI>
pretends to have receiv'd &s;everal ill Offices
from that Lady; but I'm the le&s;s inclinable to
think that &s;he was acce&s;&s;ory to &s;uch an inhuman

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Hope this Letter will in &s;ome mea&s;ure atone
for my long Silence, and convince you that
my Neglect was not the only Cau&s;e of my not
writing to you once every Month, according to
your De&s;ire: For I concluded that a compleat
Relation of the Compaign wou'd be a more ac|ceptable
Pre&s;ent to you, than if I had &s;ent you
from time to time &s;ome interrupted and ill-con|nected
Accounts of it. Be&s;ides, I was &s;o little
Ma&s;ter of my Time during the whole Month
of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> that you cannot with Ju&s;tice refu&s;e to
put a le&s;s &s;evere Con&s;truction on my Silence:
And I'm confident that after you have read the
Account of my Misfortunes in the beginning of
this Month, you will e&s;teem me a fitter Object
of your Compa&s;&s;ion than Anger. Perhaps you
little expected to hear of my Confinement to a
clo&s;e Pri&s;on for fifteen Days; but I can a&s;&s;ure
you, that if the Marque&s;s <HI>D'Efiat</HI> had not vouch|&s;af'd
me his Protection, and clear'd me of all
<PB N="10" REF="22">
my &s;u&s;pected Crimes, in a Letter to Mon&s;ieur
<HI>de Chamilly,</HI> for ought I know, I might have been
&s;till in the &s;ame Condition. But before I give
you a particular Account of that Accident, the
Order of time obliges me to entertain you with
a Relation of our Warlike Expeditions.</P>
<P>While our Army, in <HI>July,</HI> lay quiet, the Ele|ctor
of <HI>Brandenburg</HI> attack'd and took <HI>Kei&s;erwaert:</HI>
And we were afterwards inform'd, that,
not content with that Succe&s;s, he &s;ate down
before <HI>Bonn;</HI> and that <HI>Mentz</HI> was inve&s;ted by the
Dukes of <HI>Bavaria</HI> and <HI>Lorrain,</HI> with an Army of
Seventy thou&s;and Men, which oblig'd us to make
a Diver&s;ion in the <HI>Palatinate:</HI> And that De&s;ign
was executed with &s;o much Fury and Cruelty,
that Po&s;terity will hardly ever give credit to that
part of the Hi&s;tory of our Age. We pa&s;s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d the
<HI>Rhine</HI> at <HI>Philips<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">urg</HI> on a Bridge of Boats, in the
beginning of <HI>Augu&s;t.</HI> I need not tell you that
this City was &s;urrender'd to the <HI>Dauphin</HI> on his
Birth-day (<HI>Novemb.</HI> 1.) which he render'd famous
by his fir&s;t Conque&s;t: But I cannot forbear do|ing
Ju&s;tice to the Bravery and Greatne&s;s of Mind
which he &s;hew'd on that Occa&s;ion. For he was
everywhere pre&s;ent, and neither gave his Orders
by Proxy, nor &s;uffer'd any thing to be done
without his Knowledge. <HI>Philipsburg</HI> is a very in|con&s;iderable
Town, &s;carce able to contain a nu|merous
Gari&s;on, nor can it boa&s;t of one remark|able
Hou&s;e, but that which belongs to the Go|vernour.
But, notwith&s;tanding tho&s;e Defects,
'tis a place of great importance, both by rea&s;on
of its Situation between the <HI>Rhine</HI> and a large
and deep Mar&s;h, and its numerous Fortifications.
There was a Redoubt on the other &s;ide of the
<HI>Rhine</HI> to defend the Pa&s;&s;age of the River, which
the <HI>Dauphin</HI> took in two Days: But there are &s;o
many new Works added, that it may be call'd
<PB N="11" REF="22">
more properly a con&s;iderable Fort than a &s;im|ple
Redoubt. The next Day we encamp'd be|fore
<HI>Heydelberg,</HI> which we inve&s;ted on the &s;ide
next the <HI>Rhine.</HI> This City was part of our la&s;t
Year's Conque&s;ts, and had paid Contributions
two or three times. Some of our Troops had
their Winter-Quarters in it, and po&s;&s;e&s;s'd it with|out
the lea&s;t Di&s;turbance till the Spring, when
by an unaccountable &s;ort of Policy, we blew up
the Ca&s;tle, and left the Town (I think) on pur|po&s;e
that we might have the plea&s;ure of Be&s;ieging it
two Months after: For you mu&s;t not imagine
becau&s;e the Trenches were not open'd, that the
Siege was never really intended, &s;ince 'tis plain
from rea&s;on that we &s;ate down before it with
that de&s;ign, becau&s;e we cou'd not have cho&s;en a
more probable way to divert the Imperial Forces:
And be&s;ides, 'tis certain that Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Duras</HI>
had given Orders for a general A&s;&s;ault the Day
on which the Place was reliev'd by a Detach|ment
of 3000 Men, who enter'd the Town with
&s;everal Boats laden with Ammunition, and all
&s;orts of nece&s;&s;ary Provi&s;ions. However, our Ar|my,
con&s;i&s;ting of 25000 Men, with 45 Pieces of
Cannon, lay &s;even Days before it, during which
time we lo&s;t 8 or 900 good Soldiers, be&s;ides &s;e|veral
Officers; and were at la&s;t forc'd to leave
a defencele&s;s Town, that might have been &s;torm'd
with Sword in Hand the fir&s;t Night we &s;ate
down before it: For we had already ruin'd tho&s;e
incon&s;iderable Fortifications that defended it, be|fore
we left it in the Spring: And at the &s;ame
time we blew up the Ca&s;tle, or at lea&s;t the be&s;t
part of it, in which alone the &s;trength of the
Place con&s;i&s;ted. Neverthele&s;s all its Defects might
have been corrected by an indu&s;trious Ma&s;ter:
And be&s;ides, it mu&s;t be acknowledg'd to be a

Advantages of its Situation; for it wou'd have
open'd a Pa&s;&s;age on the <HI>Neckar,</HI> and made us
Ma&s;ters of the whole Country as far as <HI>Franckfort.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Heydelberg</HI> is the Chief City of the Palatinate of
the <HI>Rhine,</HI> &s;eated on the <HI>Neckar,</HI> in a Bottom betwixt
two Hills. The Ca&s;tle where the Electors formerly
re&s;ided, &s;tands on a Hillock that commands the
Town, and has the Advantage of a lovely, but of
late neglected Garden. The Strangers that pa&s;s'd
thro' this City never fail'd to pay a Vi&s;it to the famous
<HI>Tun,</HI> of above a hundred Years &s;tanding, and were
u&s;ually receiv'd with the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">llkom&punc;</HI> which is a Gla&s;s
containing about two Quarts. The <HI>French,</HI> who
quarter'd here during the Winter, were &s;o &s;en&s;ible
of the Charms of that ho&s;pitable Ve&s;&s;el, that they
left not one Drop in it, tho' it contain'd above
300 Hog&s;heads of Wine. Near the City there
is a fair Church, con&s;i&s;ting of three &s;everal Vaults,
under which the <HI>Catholicks, Lutherans,</HI> and <HI>Calvi|ni&s;ts</HI>
perform Divine Service. It was built by
<HI>Charles Lewis,</HI> Elector Palatine, who nam'd it
<HI>The Temple of Concord,</HI> to put his Subjects in mind
that their Temporal Safety depended on their
Union; and that a diver&s;ity of Intere&s;ts was not
a nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence of Difference in Religion.
This City was formerly Mi&s;tre&s;s of one of the
fine&s;t Libraries in the World, which &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;s'd
till the Year 1622, when Count <HI>Tilly</HI> having ta|ken

<P>The City being &s;ecur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d by a &s;ea&s;onable Re|lief
from our intended A&s;&s;ault, we decamp'd on

Leagues, arriv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d about eight a-clock at the little
Town of <HI>Wi&s;eloch,</HI> which we burnt in our Pa&s;|&s;age,

after we had thru&s;t out the Inhabitants.
<HI>Sin&s;ennes,</HI> and &s;everal other Villages, met with the &s;ame
Treatment from our Dragoons, who were always
entru&s;ted with the&s;e fiery Commi&s;&s;ions. The&s;e
Mini&s;ters of our Fury allow'd no longer re&s;pite
to the Places they were order'd to de&s;troy, than
what might give 'em lei&s;ure to plunder the be&s;t
Effects of the Inhabitants, ravi&s;h their Wives and
Daughters, and commit a thou&s;and other Di&s;or|ders.
The Fame of our Cruelties was quickly &s;pread
over the Countries of <HI>Wirtemberg</HI> and <HI>Baden,</HI> and
drove away all the Inhabitants of the Towns and
Villages to which we approach'd; who fled from
us as from the Enemies and De&s;troyers of Man|kind,
endeavouring to &s;ave their Lives in the Woods
and Fore&s;ts, where many of 'em &s;eeking to avoid
one kind of Death, met with another no le&s;s terri|ble,
and cho&s;e rather to be <HI>&s;tarv'd</HI> than <HI>kill'd;</HI>
&s;o that from hence-forward during our whole
March, we found not one Per&s;on, either in the
Towns or Country thro' which we pa&s;s'd. On|ly
<HI>Weingarten</HI> and <HI>Bruch&s;al</HI> pretended to &s;top our
Career; but two Days after they were con&s;train'd
to Surrender, and both the Garri&s;ons and Inhabi|tants
were made Pri&s;oners of War, and the Towns
were treated with the &s;ame Severity with tho&s;e
that were formerly mention'd, by the Troops that
enter'd into 'em. At the &s;ame time Mon&s;ieur <HI>de
Boufflers,</HI> who commanded a Flying Camp, came
before a little Town call'd <HI>Cocheim,</HI> in which there
was a Garri&s;on of 600 Men, and fearing lea&s;t the
Place &s;hou'd be reliev'd, immediately gave Or|ders
for an A&s;&s;ault, which was carry'd on and
receiv'd with equal Vigour and Bravery. The
Action la&s;ted two Hours, after which our Men
were oblig'd to retire; but the Major, who com|manded
in the Town, contenting him&s;elf with
&s;o remarkable a Succe&s;s, and concluding that the
<PB N="14" REF="24">
Courage of the <HI>French</HI> Troops was &s;o well cool'd,
that they wou'd hardly venture to return to a
place where they had met with &s;o rough a Treat|ment,
in&s;tead of taking Mea&s;ures to prevent a
Surprize, went to recruit his Spirits after &s;o hot
an Action, with a Gla&s;s of his beloved Wine:
In the mean time Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Boufflers,</HI> upon a
Signal which was made to him by &s;ome Tray|tors
in the Town, commanded his Dragoons to
renew the Attack, which they did with greater
Vigour than before, and &s;torming the Town,
ran to the place of Arms, with their Swords in
their Hands, where they found the Garri&s;on drawn
up in <HI>Battalia,</HI> whom they put to the Sword,
not allowing them the benefit of Quarter. The
Slaughter la&s;ted three Hours, during which, Men,
Women, and Children were kill'd without Mer|cy:
Nor could the Fury of the Soldiers be &s;topp'd
till the General had by repeated Orders com|manded
'em to put an end to the Ma&s;&s;acre.
They were Ma&s;ters of the Art of &s;queezing Mo|ney
even out of tho&s;e who had none, which
they had learn'd in <HI>France,</HI> at the expence of the
poor <HI>Prote&s;tants;</HI> and here they di&s;play'd all their
Skill, u&s;ing the Inhabitants with the utmo&s;t Bar|barity,
to make 'em di&s;cover their Trea&s;ures.
From thence Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Boufflers,</HI> continuing his
March and his Cruelties, burnt entirely the
Towns of <HI>Key&s;ere&s;ch, Dhonu, Helle&s;heim, Meyem, Ul|man,
Kerpen,</HI> and all the other Cities and Villages
of that Country, which oblig'd the Elector of
<HI>Brandenburg</HI> to detach 10000 Men, under the com|mand
of General <HI>Schonen,</HI> to give him Battle; but
that Unfaithful Officer communicated the Orders
he had receiv'd to the Marque&s;s <HI>de Boufflers,</HI> who
immediately retir'd to <HI>Philipsburg.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="24">
In the mean time we were no le&s;s careful
than <HI>Boufflers</HI>'s Dragoons to act the part of brave
Incendiaries, and continu'd our March from <HI>Bruch|&s;al</HI>
to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">aden</HI> and <HI>Durlach,</HI> where we found the
Ware-Hou&s;es, Shops, and Hou&s;es full of Commo|dities
and Furniture, but altogether void of In|habitants,
who were taught by the Misfortunes
of their Neighbours, not to expect our Vi&s;it.
The Pillage la&s;ted two Days; after which the
Cities were &s;et on Fire, after the laudable Cu|&s;tom
of this Campaign.</P>
<P><HI>Baden</HI> is &s;ituated in <HI>Suabia,</HI> and gives the Title
of Marque&s;s to a Family, the Head of which is
a Prince of the Empire on a double Account,
both by his Birth, which is Ancient and Illu&s;tri|ous,
and by his Principality, which gives him a
Voice in the Diets of the Empire. The Town
was Rich, embelli&s;h'd with fine Hou&s;es, fair Streets,
and lovely Gardens; and be&s;ides had the Ad|vantage
of the mo&s;t remarkable Baths in <HI>Europe.</HI>
The Prince&s;s of <HI>Baden</HI> left no means on her &s;ide
to pre&s;erve their City; &s;he &s;ollicited the Gene|ral
and the King him&s;elf, and offer'd to demo|li&s;h
the Walls; but all her Endeavours cou'd not
procure the lea&s;t Mitigation of its Doom, and
<HI>Baden</HI> was laid in A&s;hes, as well as its Neigh|bouring
Towns.</P>
<P>Four Leagues from hence lay <HI>Durlach,</HI> call'd in
<HI>Latine, Durlacum,</HI> which gives &s;ome Title of Ho|nour,
to the Younger Branch of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Baden,</HI>
who have al&s;o a Voice in the <HI>Diets.</HI> It was in my
Opinion a larger and fairer Town than <HI>Baden,</HI> inha|bited
by &s;everal rich Merchants, and a con&s;iderable
number of Per&s;ons of Quality, and adorn'd with ma|ny
magnificent Structures, which I had not time to
con&s;ider at lei&s;ure, before the fatal Sentence was
executed upon 'em. The Ca&s;tle particularly was a
&s;tately Edifice; a magnificent Portal open'd a Pa&s;|&s;age
<PB N="16" REF="25">
into a va&s;t Court; from whence we a&s;cended
by a broad Stair-Ca&s;e, to a large Hall, out of which
you might pa&s;s into the Apartments appointed for
Winter and Summer, and all the other Sea&s;ons. The
Furniture of all the&s;e Apartments was very rich, and
well-contriv'd, at lea&s;t as far as I cou'd judge by
what was left; for the mo&s;t precious Part of it, with
all the Plate, was remov'd; only there remain'd &s;e|veral
Pieces of very fine Tape&s;try richly Wrought,
Embroider'd Silk Beds of great Value, and &s;ome of
Gold and Silver; Tables and Cabinets of <HI>China-Work,</HI>
Looking-Gla&s;&s;es, magnificent Lamps of Chry&s;tal,
and &s;everal other Ornaments of the &s;ame Nature;
which in&s;pir'd the Beholder with a great <HI>Idea</HI> of
the Richne&s;s of that part of the Furniture which
was remov'd. The Platfond of the Library was
enrich'd with Gilding and very curious Paintings,
and it contain'd between four and five thou&s;and Vo|lumes;
adjoining to this were two Cabinets full of
Papers rank'd from top to bottom in very good
Order. The di&s;po&s;itions of the Gardens were &s;uita|ble
to the Beauty of the Hou&s;e, and the Eye was
every where &s;aluted with Objects of Plea&s;ure; but
all tho&s;e Beauties were con&s;um'd by the mercile&s;s
Fire, and reduc'd to a few Heaps of A&s;hes, and
di&s;mal Ruines. During our abode here, the <HI>Germans,</HI>
who had made a Detachment of Two or Three thou|&s;and
Men to di&s;turb us, took &s;ome of our Men, with
Two hundred Hor&s;es that were Forraging in the
Country. They had done the &s;ame at <HI>Sin&s;ennes,</HI> and
be&s;ides a terrible Sickne&s;s made &s;uch a prodigious
Havock among our Troops, that when we arriv'd at
<HI>Strasburg</HI> we were forc'd to &s;end above Six thou|&s;and
Men to the Ho&s;pital, which le&s;&s;en'd our Army
to &s;uch a Degree, that the Number of tho&s;e who
were render'd u&s;ele&s;s by the Sickne&s;s, with tho&s;e
who were kill'd at <HI>Heydelberg, Bruch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">al,</HI> and <HI>Wein|garten</HI>
amounted to 11000 Men, of which there
<PB N="17" REF="25">
were at lea&s;t 5000 dead, without reckoning above
1000 Hor&s;es, that were either taken from us, or
dy'd by the Way; for the ill Weather that had la&s;t|ed
during the whole Campaign, had &s;o weaken'd
and &s;poil'd 'em, that only &s;uch who were very well
mounted were Ma&s;ters of a Hor&s;e fit for Service.</P>
<P>To return to our March; We decamp'd from
<HI>Durlach,</HI> and leaving <HI>Fort-Lewis</HI> on our Right-hand,
which is a &s;trong and well-fortify'd Place, built by
the King's Order, we arriv'd before <HI>Stolof,</HI> the only
Town that e&s;cap'd the utmo&s;t Marks of our Fury;
for the Magi&s;trates, to appea&s;e <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Duras,</HI>
pre&s;ented him with the Summ of 50000 Crowns,
which prevail'd &s;o far on his good Nature, that he
contented him&s;elf with ordering the Town to be
pillag'd, and the Walls to be demoli&s;h'd. Two days
after we arriv'd near <HI>Strasburg,</HI> where I was con&s;train'd
to leave the Army, in a manner that was not very
agreeable to my Humour. I was &s;truck with &s;o
much Horrour, when I reflected on the Barbarities,
and the De&s;olation of &s;o many Towns of which
I had been an Eye-witne&s;s, and &s;ometimes an In|&s;trument,
that I cou'd not forbear expre&s;&s;ing my
Indignation, and was therefore look'd upon as a
&s;u&s;picious Per&s;on by &s;ome of our mo&s;t re&s;olute
<HI>Burners.</HI> It happen'd one day, that being en|gag'd
in a pretty warm Di&s;pute with &s;ome Offi|cers
that were none of my be&s;t Friends, at the
General's Quarters, I handl'd tho&s;e nice Points
with a great deal of Freedom, and plainly told
'em my Opinion of the Revolution in <HI>England,</HI>
and of the Difference between King <HI>William</HI>'s Way
of making War, and that which was in Fa&s;hion
among us. So bold a Declaration of my Senti|ments,
procur'd me the Title of the Prince of
<HI>Orange's</HI> Spy; and Complaints were made again&s;t
me to the Count <HI>de Mar&s;in,</HI> Commander of the
Brigade, who order'd me to be apprehended, and
<PB N="18" REF="26">
carry'd to <HI>Strasburg;</HI> tho' I mu&s;t own my &s;elf ob|lig'd
to him, that he forbore putting me in the
Mercy of a <HI>Council of War,</HI> till he &s;hou'd receive
a clearer Information of my Crime; in order to
which he commanded my Trunks to be &s;eiz'd,
where he found nothing to confirm his Su&s;picions,
but a <HI>Book of P&s;alms,</HI> which was a &s;ufficient Demon|&s;tration
(of what I did not deny) that I had been
a <HI>Hugonot.</HI> But the Marque&s;s <HI>d' Efiat</HI> had the Gene|ro&s;ity
(as I told you before) to give me &s;o favour|able
a Character in a Letter which he wrote to
<HI>Mon&s;ieur de Chamilly</HI> on this Occa&s;ion, that I was &s;et
at Liberty after an Impri&s;onment of fifteen Days,
without any other Puni&s;hment, than that I was
oblig'd to hear the tedious Exhortations of certain
<HI>Je&s;uits</HI> and <HI>Capuchins,</HI> to whom I promis'd to be a
<HI>Good Catholick</HI> for the future.</P>
<P>We are inform'd that <HI>Mentz</HI> was &s;urrender'd on
the 8<HI>th.</HI> in&s;tant, notwith&s;tanding the brave Re&s;i|&s;tance
made by the Marque&s;s <HI>d' Uxelles,</HI> Governour
of the Place, who perform'd on this occa&s;ion, all
that cou'd be expected from a Man of Courage and
an experienc'd Captain; and defended a Place which
is not very con&s;iderable for its Strength, again&s;t a nu|merous
Army commanded by two Princes, on whom,
without running the hazard of being accus'd of
Flattery, I may be&s;tow the glorious Title of <HI>He|roes.</HI>
'Tis true he lo&s;t a great number of Men; but
none that are acquainted with Affairs of this Na|ture,
will be &s;urpriz'd at the le&s;&s;ening of the Numbers
of a Garri&s;on that turn the War upon their Be&s;iegers,
and make three vigorous Sallies in one Day. The
mo&s;t con&s;iderable Lo&s;s they &s;u&s;tain'd, was occa&s;ion'd
by the general A&s;&s;ault of the Counter&s;carp, on the
7<HI>th.</HI> in&s;tant in the Evening, which la&s;ted five Hours,
and was both carry'd on, and receiv'd with &s;uch an
ob&s;tinate Fury, that few old Soldiers can pretend to
have &s;een &s;o warm a Di&s;pute. But at la&s;t the Be|&s;ieg'd
<PB N="19" REF="26">
were forc'd to retire, their Powder failing,
and mo&s;t of their Mu&s;quets being &s;plit; and the
<HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> lodg'd them&s;elves on the Counter&s;carp,
and began to fill up the Ditch, in order to a&s;&s;ault the
Town, which oblig'd the Governour to beat a <HI>Par|ley,</HI>
and <HI>Capitulate.</HI> The Garri&s;on march'd out with
their Arms and Baggage, Drums beating, Colours
flying, Matches lighted, and their Bullets in their
Mouths, with &s;ix Pieces of Cannon, and two Mor|tars.
I hear the King was &s;o well &s;atisfi'd with the
Marque&s;s <HI>d' Uxelles</HI>'s Conduct on this Occa&s;ion, that
he thought he ow'd him no le&s;s a Recompence for
making &s;o brave a Defence, than the Government
of <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> which is one of the mo&s;t important
Places in his Dominions, be&s;ides a Gratuity of 1200
Crowns, which he has already receiv'd. Nor cou'd
his Maje&s;ty have cho&s;en a more de&s;erving Object of
his Favour; for the Marque&s;s <HI>d' Uxelles</HI> is not only
an excellent Captain, but in all other re&s;pects a
well-accompli&s;h'd Per&s;on. I never heard that he
was accus'd of any other Crimes, but Haughtine&s;s
to his Inferiour Officers, and an Inclination to cer|tain
Plea&s;ures that were brought into Fa&s;hion about
20 or 30 Years ago: but I am &s;o far from pre|tending
to warrant the Truth of the&s;e Accu&s;ations,
that I mu&s;t confe&s;s I believe 'em to be meer malici|ous
A&s;per&s;ions.</P>
<P>We have al&s;o receiv'd Advice, That <HI>Bonn</HI> is very
much &s;traiten'd; &s;o that if the King lo&s;e that Place,
he will only retain <HI>Philipsburg,</HI> of all the Conque&s;ts
his Son made la&s;t Year.</P>
<P>In the mean time I mu&s;t tell you, with all the
&s;incerity of a Friend, that my late unju&s;t Impri|&s;onment
has mightily cool'd my Affection to the
<HI>French</HI> Service; and be&s;ides, as young as I am, my

<P><HI>Strasburg</HI> is a large City, very well built, af|ter

&s;o that you may di&s;cover the City from the
Mountains of <HI>Saverne,</HI> which are eight Leagues
di&s;tant from it. 'Tis wa&s;h'd by the River <HI>Ill,</HI>
and divided into the Old and and New City
by the <HI>Beu&s;che;</HI> and both the&s;e Rivers fall into
the <HI>Rhine,</HI> which is but a quarter of a League
di&s;tant from the Town. The Bi&s;hop of this place
is Suffragan to the Elector of <HI>Mentz;</HI> and at pre|&s;ent
the Cardinal of <HI>Fur&s;temberg</HI> is Bi&s;hop of
<HI>Strasburg</HI> by the Mercy of God, and of the
Crown of <HI>France.</HI> The Count of <HI>Chamilly,</HI> Lieu|tenant-General
of his Maje&s;ty's Armies, is Go|vernour,
and Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Labadie</HI> formerly Major,
was made the King's Lieutenant &s;ince I came to
the City. 'Tis a very ancient City, but was
never acknowledged for a Republick till the time
of <HI>Luther,</HI> who&s;e Doctrine it receiv'd: And its
Rights were never &s;ince di&s;puted till the Year
1682, when the King made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of
it, as a Dependence, or rather the Capital City
<PB N="21" REF="27">
of <HI>Al&s;ace,</HI> which belongs to him by Virtue of the
Treaty of <HI>Mun&s;ter.</HI> You are not unacquainted with
the Methods that were taken to ju&s;tifie his Preten&s;i|ons.
The Eyes of &s;ome of the principal Burgoma|&s;ters
were &s;o well enlighten'd with the Summ of
100000 Crowns, that all their Doubts were clear'd
in a Moment; and tho&s;e Con&s;cientious Magi&s;trates
put his Maje&s;ty in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a Place to which
he had a&s;&s;erted his Right by &s;uch convincing
Arguments, with all the Self-denial and Di&s;inte|re&s;&s;edne&s;s
that cou'd be de&s;ir'd. But this Re&s;tau|ration
was not made with the Unanimous Con|&s;ent
of the Citizens, the greate&s;t part of whom
bewail'd, and continue &s;till to bewail the Lo&s;s
of their Liberty, which, next the Sovereign Good,
ought to be the deare&s;t Ble&s;&s;ing to all ge|nerous
Minds. Nor are their Complaints ill|grounded;
for they have been extremely harras'd
of late, and even their Religion cou'd not e&s;cape
the Fury of their new Ma&s;ters. I know not what
Excu&s;e can be pretended for &s;o manife&s;t a Vio|lation
of the Rights of a free City, that &s;ubmit|ted
on Condition that its Liberty, and all its o|ther
Privileges, &s;hou'd be pre&s;erv'd intire. Be|&s;ides,
if they be only con&s;ider'd as Natives of <HI>Al|&s;ace,</HI>
what plau&s;ible Rea&s;on can be alledg'd why
they &s;hou'd be treated with greater Severity than
the re&s;t of their Neighbours? Has not the King
an equal Right to the whole Province? and why
&s;hou'd <HI>Strasburg</HI> be &s;ingl'd out for the Object of
his Indignation, &s;ince there are &s;everal le&s;s con&s;i|derable
Places in <HI>Al&s;ace,</HI> who&s;e Privileges are &s;uf|fer'd
to remain untouch'd? Thus, for Example,
the Inhabitants of St. <HI>Mary aux Mines,</HI> in the <HI>Ger|man</HI>
part of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> continue &s;till in the enjoy|ment
of their ancient Rights; the River &s;eparates

<HI>Catholicks:</HI> The &s;ame Privileges are common both
<PB N="22" REF="28">
to the Prie&s;ts and Mini&s;ters, and they live in a
peaceful Union without incroaching upon one
another. I was inform'd by the Guardian of the
<HI>Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">deliers</HI> in that place, that when the Queen
came thither, in her Journey to receive the <HI>Dau|phine&s;s,</HI>
&s;he re&s;olv'd to build a Chapel, in perfor|mance
of a Vow &s;he had made, and appointed
the Place where it &s;hou'd be erected in the Ter|ritory
of the <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> who immediately came
to beg her Maje&s;ty not to violate their Privile|ges,
which they &s;hew'd her; and &s;he was &s;o well
&s;atisfy'd with the Ju&s;tice of their De&s;ire, that
&s;he was ea&s;ily prevail'd with to countermand her
former Orders. And I can a&s;&s;ure you, that the
Privileges of that paltry Village are &s;till pre&s;erv'd
with &s;o little innovation, that I have &s;een with
my own Eyes the <HI>Catholicks</HI> and <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> per|form
Divine Service by Turns in the Parochial
Church. But it &s;eems the People of <HI>Strasburg</HI>
were not thought worthy of &s;o favourable a
Treatment. The <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> who were &s;ole Ma|&s;ters
of the Cathedral, were compell'd to give
place to the <HI>Catholicks,</HI> who are at pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;s'd
both of that and mo&s;t other Churches in the
City, tho' about twelve Years ago they cou'd on|ly
pretend a Right to a Chapel that belongs
to the Order of <HI>Malta.</HI> This is certainly one of
the faire&s;t Churches in <HI>Europe;</HI> and I may venture
to &s;ay, that its Steeple cannot be parrallel'd in the
whole World: This magnificent Tower is con|triv'd
with wonderful Art, and the Stones are all
exactly cut into &s;everal Figures, which charm the
Eye of the Spectator: Its heights amounts to 560
Foot, and its breadth to 52; the Doors are of
Bra&s;s, and proportionable to the largene&s;s of the
Building. Since the <HI>Catholicks</HI> became Ma&s;ters of
it, they have built a great Altar, according to the
Modern way, in the Floor of the Nave, which
<PB N="23" REF="28">
is of a Triangular Figure, with large Mar|ble
Columns at the Angles, &s;upporting a Dome
adorn'd with many <HI>Ba&s;&s;o-relievo's,</HI> and fine
Paintings. The Tabernacle is in the middle of
the Altar, enrich'd with excellent Sculptures;
and all the other Ornaments are Beautiful be|yond
the po&s;&s;ibility of Improvement. But all
the Charms of &s;o rare a Piece of Work|man&s;hip
cannot long detain the Spectator from
&s;atisfying his Curio&s;ity with a View of that ad|mirable
Clock built by the Chapter, which marks
the Minutes, Hours, Days of the Month and
Week, the Age of the Moon, Signs of the <HI>Zodi|ack,</HI>
and the Centuries or Ages of the World,
by a Wheel that performs only one Round in
the &s;pace of a hundred Years. If you wou'd
have the plea&s;ure to behold all the Beauties of
the Clock, you mu&s;t wait till Noon, when the
twelve Apo&s;tles appear, and each knocks with a
Hammer on the Bell. The &s;triking of this, as
well as of all the re&s;t of the Hours, is preceded by
the crowing of a Cock, who claps' his Wings,
&s;tretches out his Neck, and Crows &s;o naturally,
that if your Eyes did not convince you that he
is made of Copper, you wou'd certainly conclude
him to be really that which he repre&s;ents. Immedi|ately
after the Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Annunciation</HI> appears,
the Door of the Virgin's Chamber opens, and the
Angel <HI>Gabriel</HI> comes to intimate her Conception;
the Virgin, who is on her Knees at Prayer, turns
to hear his Me&s;&s;age; and at the &s;ame time the
<HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> de&s;cends upon her Head in form of a
Dove: And all the&s;e Motions are perform'd with
an admirable Exactne&s;s.</P>
<P>This beautiful Church is not the only Orna|ment
of <HI>Strasburg:</HI> The re&s;t of its Buildings de|&s;erve
an attentive Con&s;ideration, e&s;pecially the
Fortifications, on which the King has be&s;tow'd
<PB N="24" REF="29">
&s;uch prodigious Summs: The Citadel has its pe|culiar
Beauties, where the King entertains a Com|pany
of <HI>Cadets.</HI> But the City is &s;o extremely
large, and lies &s;o open, that all the Works with
which it is &s;urrounded, cou'd hardly re&s;i&s;t the
Attacks of a powerful Enemy, if it were not co|verd

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Left <HI>Strasburg</HI> about the end of the la&s;t Month,
and pa&s;&s;ing by <HI>Saverne, Phalsburg,</HI> and <HI>Mar&s;al,</HI>
(which is much different from what it was here|tofore)
arriv'd at <HI>Metz</HI> in <HI>Lorrain,</HI> from whence
the Cardinal of <HI>Fur&s;temburg</HI> was gone &s;ome Days
before. He retir'd to this place in the beginning
of the Year, not thinking him&s;elf &s;ecure at <HI>Bonn:</HI>
And he was even &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the Danger with
which that place was threaten'd, that he brought a|long
with him the very Bolts of the Doors of
the Epi&s;copal Palace. In the mean time he put
on a &s;eeming Confidence, and talk'd of nothing
but Conque&s;ts and Electorates, promi&s;ing great
things to all his Friends; and even levy'd two
Companies of Soldiers for his Guard, whom he
was afterwards forc'd to disband for want of
Money to pay 'em. I &s;taid two Days at <HI>Metz,</HI>
to con&s;ider all its Rarities. The City is pretty
large, and tolerably well Fortify'd. There is a
Company of <HI>Cadets</HI> in the Citadel, which has
four Ba&s;tions, with good Ditches full of Water.
The Cathedral, which is dedicated to S. <HI>Stephen,</HI>
is built on the declivity of a Hillock; &s;o that
whereas we u&s;ually a&s;cend to other Churches,
we mu&s;t go down &s;even or eight Steps to this.
It is a large Building, tho' there is nothing re|markable
in it but the Bap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;mal Font, con&s;i&s;ting
of one piece of <HI>Porphyrie,</HI> about ten Foot long,
which is a Rarity in this Country. The Bi&s;hop
a&s;&s;umes the Title of a <HI>Prince of the Holy Empire;</HI>
and is a Suffragan of the Elector of <HI>Triers.</HI> This
<PB N="26" REF="30">
City was formerly the Metropolis of the King|dom
of <HI>Au&s;tra&s;ia,</HI> which <HI>Clovis</HI> I. gave to his Na|tural
Son <HI>Thierry,</HI> creating him the fir&s;t King of
it: Afterwards it purchas'd its Liberty for the
Summ of 100000 Crowns, of <HI>Godfrey</HI> of <HI>Bouillon,</HI>
at his departure for the <HI>Holy Land,</HI> and main|tain'd
the Character of a Republick till the Year
1552, in which it was treacherou&s;ly &s;eiz'd by the
Con&s;table <HI>de Montmorenci,</HI> in the Name of <HI>Henry</HI> II.
For pretending to go to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the
<HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> he ask'd permi&s;&s;ion to en|ter
the City, under pretext that he had fall'n &s;ick
by the Way; and the next Morning &s;ent to ac|quaint
the Mayor and Echevins of the Town,
that he was de&s;irous to communicate an Affair
of great importance to 'em before his Death.
When he &s;aw 'em all met together in his Cham|ber,
he &s;tarted up, and thru&s;t his Poniard into
the Mayor's Brea&s;t, for a Signal to his Followers
to &s;tab the re&s;t of the Magi&s;trates: And imme|diately
after the Execution of that cruel Trea|&s;on,
the <HI>French</HI> run about the Streets, crying, <HI>Vi|ve
le Roy,</HI> and made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the
Gates, and afterwards of the whole City. About
the end of the &s;ame Year, it was in vain be&s;ie|ged
by <HI>Charles</HI> V. who was forc'd to make a
&s;hameful Retreat by the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e,</HI> who de|fended
the place. Since that un&s;ucce&s;sful Attempt,
<HI>Metz</HI> remain'd &s;till under the Dominion or ra|ther
Protection of our Kings: For the Inhabi|tants
carry'd all their Appeals before the Impe|rial
Chamber at <HI>Spire,</HI> till <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. e&s;tabli&s;h'd
a Parliament in this place, extending its Juri&s;di|ction
over <HI>Toul, Verdun,</HI> and the Country of <HI>Me&s;|&s;in.</HI>
The Emperour complain'd of this Innova|tion;
nor was the Conte&s;t that happen'd on this
Occa&s;ion entirely decided, till the Peace that was
concluded in 1648. Be&s;ides the Parliament, the
<PB N="27" REF="30">
King erected a new Court of Judicature here
&s;ome Years ago, which has had the Impudence
(if I may u&s;e that Expre&s;&s;ion without expo&s;ing
my &s;elf to the &s;ame Cen&s;ure) to cite before it
Kings and Sovereign Princes, to yield Homage
and Fealty for &s;ome Territories over which they
pretend to have a Right of Superiority, as the
Counties of <HI>Chini</HI> and <HI>Alo&s;t,</HI> the Dutchy of <HI>Deux-Ponts,</HI>
and &s;everal others.</P>
<P>This is the only City in <HI>France</HI> where <HI>Jews</HI>
are permitted to &s;ettle; and there are even &s;ome
Towns in <HI>Al&s;ace</HI> where they dare not lodge one
Night. At <HI>Strasburg</HI> they are forc'd to pay thir|ty
<HI>Sous</HI> at the Gate, before they are &s;uffer'd to
enter the City; and I have been often &s;urpriz'd
at the extraordinary dexterity of the Toll-ga|therers
in di&s;covering a Man of that Nation.</P>
<P>From <HI>Metz</HI> I came to <HI>Nanci,</HI> the chief City
of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and Re&s;idence of the Dukes of that
Name. 'Tis hardly po&s;&s;ible that a Town which
has chang'd its Ma&s;ters &s;o often, &s;hou'd be re|markable
for its Riches: However, 'tis very well
fortify'd; and the &s;ame Prince by who&s;e Orders
'twas almo&s;t entirely ruin'd in 1661, was after|wards
pleas'd to repair it. The River <HI>Meurte</HI>
pa&s;&s;es by the Walls, and fills the Ditches, which
are of a con&s;iderable Depth. The City is divi|ded
into the High and Low Town; and the
Ducal Palace, which is &s;eated in the former, is
a very large Structure, of an admirable
Architecture, and adorn'd with many fine Pi|ctures.
Among its other Rarities, there is a Hu|mane
Figure of Wood, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal Pie|ces,
fitted together with &s;o much Exactne&s;s and
Art, that it may be made to imitate all the
Motions and Ge&s;tures of a living Man. S. <HI>George</HI>'s
Church is particularly remarkable for the Magni|ficent
Tombs of the Dukes that lie inter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d there.
<PB N="28" REF="31">
About &s;even or eight Years ago this City was
depriv'd of two of its noble&s;t Ornaments; the
famous Culverin, that &s;hot a Bullet to S. <HI>Nicho|las,</HI>
a Village two large Leagues from <HI>Nanci;</HI> and
the Brazen Hor&s;e, that carri'd the Statue of one
of the Dukes of <HI>Lorrain.</HI> The&s;e are cer|tainly
the fine&s;t ca&s;t Pieces in <HI>France,</HI> and were
always thought too heavy for Carriage, till a
certain Engineer undertook to remove 'em, and
&s;ucceeded in the Attempt. The latter was de|&s;ign'd
to &s;upport the King's Statue in the Place
of Conque&s;ts at <HI>Paris,</HI> but was found to be of
too &s;mall a &s;ize; and the other was carry'd to
<HI>Dunkirk.</HI> The Inhabitants of this City, and, in
general, all the Third State (or Commons) of
<HI>Lorrain,</HI> are &s;till extremely devoted to the In|tere&s;t
of their true and natural Prince; and &s;cru|ple
not to expre&s;s their Affection to him on all
Occa&s;ions, with a certain innocent Frankne&s;s,
which together with their Clowni&s;h way of Speak|ing,
is e&s;teem'd by the <HI>French</HI> rather worthy of Laugh|ter
than Anger. But the Nobility are &s;o dazzl'd
with the glaring Pro&s;pect of Court-Preferment,
that they &s;eem to have quite forgot the lo&s;s of
their ancient Privileges, which were &s;o great un|der
the Government of their Dukes, that they
were in a manner Sovereign Princes; whereas at
pre&s;ent they are reduc'd to an equal Level with
the re&s;t of the Gentlemen of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>I &s;tay'd not at <HI>Nanci,</HI> but continuing my Journey
towards <HI>Dijon,</HI> arriv'd at <HI>Langres</HI> in <HI>Champagne.</HI> This
City is &s;eated on a Mountain almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible on
all &s;ides: but the Inhabitants have no rea&s;on to be
proud of the &s;trength of its Situation, which makes
it a kind of Pri&s;on; for the De&s;cent from the Town
is extremely unea&s;ie, and a Man may without Va|nity
boa&s;t of his Lungs, if he can climb from the
bottom of the Hill to the Gate, without lo&s;ing his
<PB N="29" REF="31">
Breath. The People of the Country call this the
<HI>Maiden-City,</HI> both becau&s;e it has not been taken for
&s;everal Ages, and by rea&s;on of its Fidelity to the
Crown: The Bi&s;hop is both a Spiritual and Tem|poral
Lord, and has the Title of Duke and Peer of
<HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The next Day I pa&s;s'd thro' one of the mo&s;t
charming and fertil Plains in <HI>France,</HI> and arriv'd at
<HI>Dijon.</HI> The City begins to appear at a con&s;iderable
di&s;tance, and pre&s;ents a Traveller with the plea&s;ant
Pro&s;pect of 100 Spires that overtop the Hou&s;es; for
which rea&s;on <HI>Dijon</HI> is u&s;ually call'd the <HI>Town of Stee|ples.</HI>
'Tis &s;eated on the Banks of the <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">che</HI> and <HI>Su&s;on,</HI>
and was founded by the Emperour <HI>Aurelian,</HI> tho'
&s;ome affirm that 'tis much more ancient, and that
he only repair'd it. But not to invade the Province
of Antiquaries, I &s;hall content my &s;elf with a&s;&s;u|ring
you that 'tis a very fine City: The Streets are
large and fair, the Courts &s;pacious, the Buildings
very beautiful, and the Churches extremely magni|ficent.
Among the re&s;t I cannot forbear taking no|tice
of the famous Abbey of S. <HI>Benign,</HI> which was
built by <HI>Gregory,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Langres,</HI> after he had
miraculou&s;ly found the Body of that Saint. 'Tis
one of the large&s;t, and highe&s;t Structures that are
anywhere to be &s;een, adorn'd with three Stone-Spires,
the heighth of which is &s;uitable to the re&s;t
of the Building. The Abbey-Church of S. <HI>Stephen</HI> is
on the other Side of the City, and is no le&s;s remark|able
for its Beauty. The Front of <HI>Our Lady's</HI> Church
&s;urpa&s;&s;es all the re&s;t, con&s;i&s;ting of a large Clock-Tower
all over wrought, ri&s;ing between two others
&s;maller, but no le&s;s curiou&s;ly adorn'd, which charm
the Eyes of the Beholder. S. <HI>John's</HI> Church, the
Holy Chapel, the Convents of the <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> and
<HI>Cordeliers,</HI> and generally all the re&s;t of the Churches
and Convents de&s;erve particular Ob&s;ervation, e&s;pe|cially
that of the <HI>Carthu&s;ians,</HI> without the City,
<PB N="30" REF="32">
towards the <HI>Red Gate,</HI> which is one of the riche&s;t
Mona&s;teries in the Kingdom. There are a hundred
<HI>Monks</HI> in it, who ob&s;erve with &s;o religious a Strict|ne&s;s,
their Vows of Solitude and Silence, that a
Stranger vi&s;iting the Place wou'd be tempted to
think it were uninhabited. And I may venture to
add, that perhaps they may make a better u&s;e of
their Revenues than any other Convent in the King|dom:
for be&s;ides a con&s;iderable Summ which they
give to the Ho&s;pital of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> they di&s;tri|bute
every Week five or &s;ix hundred Loaves to the
Poor. They have a very fine Cloy&s;ter, and a finer
Church, where the Dukes of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> and a King
of <HI>Poland</HI> lie interr'd in magnificent Tombs.</P>
<P>On a Hillock, on the other Side of the City,
there is a Convent of one of the Orders of <HI>Mendi|cant</HI>
Friers, &s;aid to be the Hou&s;e of S. <HI>Bernard's</HI> Fa|ther,
who was Lord of the Place that &s;till retains
the Name of <HI>Bourg-fontaines.</HI> The Room where he
was born, which is a very little and low Hall, of a
&s;quare Figure, is turn'd to a Chapel, with this In|&s;cription
over the Door: <HI>Come, my Children, and I
will bring you into the Hou&s;e of my Father, and into
the Chamber where my Mother brought me forth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Dijon</HI> is the Capital City of the Dutchy of <HI>Bur|gundy:</HI>
'tis the Seat of a Parliament, Generality or
general Receipt of the <HI>Finances,</HI> Chamber of <HI>Ac|counts,</HI>
and a Court that takes Cognizance of Affairs
relating to the Coining and Value of Money; and
be&s;ides the States of the Province meet here once in
three Years: &s;o that it wants only the Dignity of
an <HI>Epi&s;copal See,</HI> being under the Juri&s;diction of the
Bi&s;hop of <HI>Langres.</HI> It had formerly very con&s;idera|ble
Privileges; and our Kings at their Acce&s;&s;ion to
the Crown, and as often as they enter'd into the
City, were oblig'd to &s;wear to pre&s;erve 'em. But
that Cu&s;tom was aboli&s;h'd by the pre&s;ent King,
when he pa&s;s'd this way to receive the Queen at her
<PB N="31" REF="32">
Arrival from <HI>Spain.</HI> For when the <HI>Mayor</HI> accom|pany'd
with the re&s;t of the Magi&s;trates, pre&s;ented
the Keys of the City, together with a Copy of
their Privileges to his Maje&s;ty, humbly be&s;eeching
him that he wou'd &s;wear to pre&s;erve 'em, after the
Example of all his Predece&s;&s;ors, and even of the
late King of Glorious Memory; Cardinal <HI>Mazarin</HI>
reply'd, <HI>Are you &s;o in&s;olent as to impo&s;e an Oath upon
your King?</HI> The Magi&s;trates &s;urpriz'd at &s;o &s;evere a
Reprimand, an&s;wer'd with a great deal of Re&s;pect,
that they pretended not to impo&s;e any thing, but
only begg'd and hop'd to obtain that Favour from
his Maje&s;ty's Ju&s;tice and Goodne&s;s. <HI>I under&s;tand
your Meaning,</HI> reply'd the Cardinal, <HI>you wou'd be a
Free City and Commonwealth. And I a&s;&s;ure you, in
his Maje&s;ty's Name, that, without taking an Oath,
he con&s;iders you as &s;uch, but prepare your &s;elves to be|come
his Conque&s;t.</HI> This Threatning was quickly ex|ecuted,
for the next Day 8000 Men enter'd the
City, and the Cardinal made a general Alteration
in the Magi&s;tracy. The Mayoralty of <HI>Dijon</HI> was
the be&s;t Place of that Nature in <HI>France;</HI> for be&s;ides
the Title of a Vi&s;count, the Government of the
City, and of all the Third E&s;tate or Commonalty
of <HI>Burgundy</HI> was annex'd to it. The Inhabitants of
this City are generally of a very free and &s;ociable
Temper, and the Women enjoy all the Advantages
of an hone&s;t Liberty. So charming a Society puts
a kind of ea&s;ie Con&s;traint upon Strangers, and
makes 'em break all their Re&s;olutions of ha&s;tening
their Departure: for 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to &s;tay here four

Acquaintance, which may afterwards prove the
Source of a great deal of Plea&s;ure. The narrow
Compa&s;s of a Letter will not allow me to in&s;ert

<P><HI>CHaalons</HI> is a con&s;iderable City, honour'd with
the Title of a <HI>County,</HI> and is the &s;ame with the
ancient <HI>Cabilonum</HI> mention'd in <HI>Cae&s;ar's Commentaries.</HI>
It appears by the Ruines of an old <HI>Amphitheatre,</HI>
that this place was formerly po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by the <HI>Romans.</HI>
I lodg'd at the <HI>Pelican,</HI> where I had the good For|tune
to meet with three Merchants of <HI>Lyons,</HI> who
were returning thither, and promis'd to &s;hew me
all the Rarities of that City. We had &s;carce tra|vell'd
a Mile, when we met with a Prie&s;t walking
a-foot, in a pretty genteel Garb: He was a Man
of a very &s;erious Mien, but talk'd wittily. He ac|cepted
the Civility of one of our Company, who
offer'd him the Conveniency of riding behind him
half a League of bad way, thro' which we were
oblig'd to pa&s;s. This Accident gave us occa&s;ion to

the Oppo&s;ition of &s;ome of my Fellow-Tra|vellers,
if he who had the Prie&s;t behind him had
not vigorou&s;ly undertaken my Defence. The Di|&s;pute
continu'd for &s;ome time pretty warm on both
&s;ides, till our mutual Wearine&s;s rather than Want
of Arguments, made us at la&s;t con&s;ent to chu&s;e the
Prie&s;t, who had not yet &s;ided with either Party,
to be Judge of our Difference. He very gravely
told us, that the controverted Story was a certain
Truth, and that he knew &s;ome Per&s;ons who were
Ma&s;ters of that Secret; I cou'd not forbear laugh|ing
at the &s;erious Tone with which he pronounc'd
Sentence again&s;t me; and he was &s;o vex'd at my
Incredulity, that he began to maintain his A&s;&s;ertion
with a great deal of heat. Immediately his Fellow-Hor&s;eman
took up the Cudgels, and they engag'd
in a Debate which la&s;ted about a Quarter of an
Hour; till at la&s;t the Prie&s;t perceiving that 'twas
in vain to contend longer with &s;o ob&s;tinate an
Adver&s;ary, told us plainly that he him&s;elf cou'd do
the Feat, tho' he never us'd to put it in Practice;
and that if his Opponent had a Mind to &s;ee the
Experiment, he wou'd make his Hor&s;e carry him
to <HI>Ma&s;con</HI> in two Hours. The Merchant took him
at his word, and &s;ummon'd him to perform his Pro|mi&s;e,
to which he con&s;ented, and immediately the
Hor&s;e gallop'd away with &s;o prodigious a Swiftne&s;s,
that we lo&s;t &s;ight of 'em in a Moment. This Acci|dent
did not much &s;urprize us at fir&s;t; for we
thought the Prie&s;t had a Spur conceal'd in his hand,
with which he prick'd the Hor&s;e: in the mean time
we rode on, but cou'd neither &s;ee, nor hear the
lea&s;t News of our Gallopers till we arriv'd at <HI>Ma&s;con</HI>
on the morrow, where we found the Merchand ve|ry
melancholick. He told us that he was carry'd
<PB N="34" REF="34">
to <HI>Ma&s;con</HI> exactly in two Hours after he left us, with
&s;o much Ea&s;e, that he imagin'd all the while he
was riding at a Hand-Gallop; but that his Hor&s;e
fell dead a&s;&s;oon as he enter'd the Stable. He con|cluded
that the Prie&s;t was a <HI>Wizard,</HI> and was &s;o
firmly per&s;waded of the Truth of his Opinion, by
the concurring Te&s;timony of our Landlord, who
knew the Man, that he enter'd an Accu&s;ation a|gain&s;t
him, and procur'd him to be apprehended
the &s;ame day. I was oblig'd to give Evidence with
the re&s;t, and to declare all that I had &s;een him do,
which, in my Opinion, cou'd not amount to a con|vincing
Proof of his Guilt. I know no Rea&s;on
that &s;hou'd hinder us from &s;uppo&s;ing that a good
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hor&s;e, &s;uch as the Merchant's was, might
with a good Spur be made to gallop eight Leagues
in two hours, and without any Enchantment fall
dead at his Journey's End. Yet this Accident made
a great Noi&s;e, and the <HI>Poor Devil</HI> was &s;ent to Pri&s;on,
where I left him. I had almo&s;t forgot to tell you
that they found in his Pockets a Piece of Parch|ment
four fingers breadth long, and two broad,
with this Sentence in <HI>Red Letters, Adjutor meus, &amp;
Protector meus, tu Domine, n&egrave; derelinquas me,</HI> with four
&s;mall <HI>Cro&s;&s;es,</HI> one at each End, one above, and ano|ther
below, which they fan&s;i'd to be a certain <HI>Charm</HI>
or <HI>Character.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Ma&s;con</HI> we proceeded on our Journey to
<HI>Lyons,</HI> where I was forc'd to &s;ell my Hor&s;e, who
was gall'd under the Saddle-Bow. I re&s;olv'd to
&s;pend &s;ome Days in this Place, that I might have
time to take a full View of a City that is e&s;teem'd
the Large&s;t and mo&s;t Con&s;iderable in the Kingdom,
next to <HI>Paris,</HI> and is certainly worthy of all the
Curio&s;ity of a Traveller. 'Tis &s;eated at the Conflu|ence
of the <HI>Rhone</HI> and the <HI>Sa&ocirc;ne,</HI> in a Bottom be|tween
two Hills. The Hou&s;es equal, or rather ex|ceed
tho&s;e of <HI>Paris</HI> in Heighth, &s;ome of 'em amount|ing
<PB N="35" REF="34">
to &s;ix Stories; which makes the Streets
&s;omewhat Dark, by rea&s;on of their Narrowne&s;s.
There are many fine Courts in the City, but none
of 'em are comparable to <HI>Belle-Cour,</HI> which is em|belli&s;h'd
with Rows of Trees; tho' its principal
Ornament con&s;i&s;ts in the Company that re&s;ort to
it; for 'tis the general Rendezvous of all the Peo|ple
of Quality and good Breeding; and &s;ince the
Ladies here are no le&s;s Generous than Charming,
and cannot ju&s;tly be accus'd of Inhumanity to
their Captives, there are many Intrigues form'd in
this Place, which are carry'd on with all the
Tenderne&s;s and Plea&s;ure that a reciprocal Pa&s;&s;ion
can in&s;pire.</P>
<P>To give you a compendious Account of the
publick Edifices in <HI>Lions,</HI> in which re&s;pect it holds
the fir&s;t Rank, without Controver&s;y, among all
the Cities of <HI>France;</HI> I &s;hall begin with the Me|tropolitan
Church, dedicated to S. <HI>John,</HI> and foun|ded
by <HI>John</HI> King of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> on the Ruines of
a Temple formerly con&s;ecrated to <HI>Augu&s;tus.</HI> There
is a <HI>Clock</HI> near the Choir, which &s;urpa&s;&s;es that
of <HI>Strasburg</HI> in the finene&s;s of its Contrivance and
Workman&s;hip; for, be&s;ides all the Rarities men|tion'd
in the De&s;cription of that famous Machine,
the Clock of <HI>Lions</HI> has &s;everal peculiar Beauties;
among which I &s;hall only take notice of the An|gel
that Chants the Hymn of S. <HI>John</HI> with all
the exactne&s;s imaginable. The Needle that marks
the Hours, and grows longer or &s;horter according
to the various dimen&s;ions of the Oval Dial, and
the Days of the Week mark'd by Figures that
appear every Morning in a Nich on the top of
the Clock, in the room of tho&s;e that po&s;&s;e&s;s'd
the &s;ame place the Day before.</P>
<P>The <HI>King of France</HI> by Virtue of his Crown, is
the fir&s;t <HI>Canon</HI> of this Church; and all the re&s;t
<PB N="36" REF="35">
have the Title of <HI>Counts;</HI> and mu&s;t prove their
Nobility before they can be receiv'd.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal other Magnificent Churches
in <HI>Lions.</HI> That of <HI>N&ocirc;tre-dame de Forvieres</HI> is one
of the mo&s;t ancient, which was formerly dedi|cated
to <HI>Venus.</HI> Every curious Traveller ought to
view the City from the Steeple of this Church,
where he may have a di&s;tinct Pro&s;pect of its Ex|tent
and Situation. Adjoining to this are the
Ruines of the Palace of <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> and of a Neigh|bouring
Amphitheatre, where Learned and Inqui|&s;itive
Antiquaries may find an excellent Oppor|tunity
to di&s;play their Skill in the Examination
of an infinite Number of In&s;criptions, Statues,
Tombs, Urns, Medals, and other rich Monu|ments
of the <HI>Roman</HI> Grandeur. But my unac|quaintedne&s;s
with tho&s;e Studies makes me purpo&s;e|ly
decline entring upon this Subject; &s;ince I'm con|fident
you'll be better pleas'd with my Silence,
than if I &s;hou'd &s;end you an imperfect or erro|neous
Account, under the &s;pecious Title of <HI>A
De&s;cription of the Antiquities of</HI> Lions.</P>
<P>The <HI>Town-Hou&s;e</HI> is a Ma&s;ter-piece of Art, com|pleatly
furni&s;h'd with all the Advantages and Or|naments
of Beauty, Situation, Extent, Height,
Architecture, Marbles, Paintings, Gardens, Foun|tains,
Antiquities, and every thing el&s;e that may
recommend a Building to the Ob&s;ervation of a
Curious and Knowing Traveller. Its Front re|gards
the <HI>Place des Terreaux,</HI> which is one of the
mo&s;t plea&s;ant Courts in in the City; and before
it there is a lovely Fountain, which is none of
its lea&s;t Con&s;iderable Ornaments. In the fir&s;t place
I took notice of a large Clock-Tower, ri&s;ing between
two high Pavilions, under which is the Entry to the
Palace adorn'd with large Columns of a precious kind
of Marble. Then I went up &s;ome Steps, and
coming under the Pavilions, ob&s;erv'd two Tables
<PB N="37" REF="35">
of Bra&s;s, where I found engrav'd in Ancient Cha|racters,
the Patent granted by the Emperour <HI>Cla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">|dius</HI>
to the Inhabitants of <HI>Lions,</HI> when he be&s;tow'd
the Privileges of <HI>Roman</HI> Citizens upon 'em. From
thence I enter'd into the Fir&s;t, and afterwards
into the Second Court, where I con&s;ider'd with
a great deal of Plea&s;ure and Attention, the Stru|cture
and De&s;ign of that Maje&s;tick Ma&s;s of Buil|ding,
which is of a Square Figure, and bounded
at the four Corners with as many large and ve|ry
high Pavilions. Afterwards I went down to
the Garden, which is embelli&s;h'd with Gravel
Walks, Beds of Flowers, Fountains, and a hun|dred
other Ornaments. After I had &s;atisfy'd my
Curio&s;ity with a View of the external Beauties of
this Noble Structure, I return'd to admire the in|&s;ide
of it. I went up a pair of winding Stairs,
of a very excellent Contrivance, to the Hall,
where I was agreeably &s;urpriz'd with its Large|ne&s;s,
Gilding, Paintings, and e&s;pecially a great
number of Pictures of the Kings of <HI>France,</HI> which
are all fini&s;h'd Pieces: And in the the other A|partments
I ob&s;erv'd a va&s;t variety of different
Beauties, which I dare not undertake to de&s;cribe.
I &s;pent the whole Morning in this Hou&s;e, and
employ'd the Afternoon with a great deal of
Satisfaction, in vi&s;iting the <HI>Ho&s;pitals,</HI> which may
be reckon'd among the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Founda|tions
of that Nature in <HI>France. H&ograve;tel Dieu</HI> is a
&s;pacious Structure, well built, and very rich:
All &s;orts of di&s;eas'd Per&s;ons are receiv'd into it;
&s;o that 'tis always very full, and wou'd hardly
be able to maintain &s;o va&s;t a Charge, notwith|&s;tanding
the greatne&s;s of its Revenues, if the
Archbi&s;hop did not be&s;tow upon it the Profits
accruing from the Di&s;pen&s;ation of eating Eggs,
Milk, Fle&s;h, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Ho&s;pital <HI>de la Charite</HI> is a
Modern Foundation; and tho' tis not near &s;o large
<PB N="38" REF="36">
as the former, it may be ju&s;tly reckon'd equal to
it in other re&s;pects. On the top of a great Por|tal,
that &s;erves for an Entry to the Building,
there is the Figure of a <HI>Pelican,</HI> tearing her Brea&s;t,
to feed her young ones; the true Emblem of
<HI>Charity</HI> I ob&s;erv'd one thing at <HI>Lions</HI> which I
had not &s;een in any other part of <HI>France,</HI> I mean
the Place of <HI>Refuge</HI> for Criminals, which is nei|ther
a Church nor Royal Palace, but a Hou&s;e
appointed for that Purpo&s;e, and u&s;ually call'd the
<HI>Sanctuary.</HI> Towards the Gate <HI>des Trions,</HI> I &s;aw the
<HI>Aqueducts</HI> that were built by the <HI>Romans</HI> for the
Conveyance of Water into the City; and not far
from thence there is a Cave, call'd the <HI>Grotto,</HI>
which is al&s;o &s;aid to be one of their Works.
The Country about the City is embelli&s;h'd with
a va&s;t number of lovely Seats, among which <HI>la
Duchere</HI> and <HI>la Claire</HI> de&s;erve a particular Ob&s;erva|tion.
The City has &s;ix Gates, three Bridges, a|bout
two hundred Streets, and above a hundred
Churches, Convents, or Chapels. The Archbi&s;hop
is the chief Prelate of the <HI>Gauls,</HI> and by Virtue
of his Primacy receives Appeals from all the
parts of <HI>France</HI> in Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Ca&s;es. Mon&s;ieur
<HI>de Villeroy</HI> is the pre&s;ent Archbi&s;hop, and Lieute|nant-General
of the whole Province. He is de|&s;cended
of a very honourable Family, but is cer|tainly
one of the roughe&s;t and lea&s;t Complai&s;ant
Men in the World. I cannot forbear relating
to you, upon this occa&s;ion, a very plea&s;ant Di|&s;cour&s;e
that pa&s;s'd between this Prelate and
Mon&s;ieur <HI>de la Feuillade.</HI></P>
<P>That Mare&s;chal, &s;ays the Story, riding Po&s;t to
<HI>Turin,</HI> in a very mean Garb, to di&s;patch &s;ome
Affairs of Importance, &s;topt at <HI>Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ns</HI> to deliver a
Packet from the King to the Archbi&s;hop, who
taking the Bearer for an Ordinary Courier, be|cau&s;e
he pretended to no higher Quality, ask'd
<PB N="39" REF="36">
him, <HI>Whether there were any</HI> News <HI>at Paris.</HI> Green
Pea&s;e, <HI>my Lord,</HI> reply'd the Mare&s;chal. <HI>You mi&s;take
my meaning, Friend,</HI> &s;aid the Archbi&s;hop; <HI>I wou'd
know what People were</HI> &s;aying <HI>when you left Paris?
My Lord,</HI> an&s;wer'd the Mare&s;chal, <HI>they were</HI> &s;aying
<HI>Ve&s;pers.</HI> Then the Prelate perceiving that the pre|tended
Courier abus'd him, fell into a Pa&s;&s;ion, &s;aying,
<HI>How, Friend? where were you taught to &s;peak thus to
Per&s;ons of my Quality and Character? What are you?&mdash;What
do People u&s;e to</HI> call <HI>you? Why, my Lord,</HI> reply'd
the Mare&s;chal, <HI>&s;ome are pleas'd to</HI> call <HI>me Friend,
others Mon&s;ieur, and the King calls me Cou&s;in.</HI> The&s;e
Words &s;urpriz'd the Archbi&s;hop, who, con&s;idering
the Mare&s;chal more attentively, at la&s;t knew him,
and made an Apology for his incivility. Never|thele&s;s
I can hardly be induc'd to believe that a
Man of his Quality wou'd have &s;toop'd to &s;uch
<HI>punning Wit,</HI> which is only graceful in the Mouth of
a true <HI>Courier:</HI> Tho' 'tis well known that Mon|&s;ieur
<HI>de la Feuillade</HI> was a Per&s;on of a very odd
and &s;ingular Humour. You have doubtle&s;s read
what an Author of great Reputation relates con|cerning
his Di&s;cour&s;e to the King about the Arch|bi&s;hop
of <HI>Rheims;</HI> and if you can believe that
Story, you will not think this incredible.</P>
<P><HI>Lions</HI> is a very ancient City, known to <HI>Titus Li|vius</HI>
and <HI>Plutarch</HI> by the Name of <HI>The I&s;land.</HI> The
Name which it &s;till retains was given to it by
<HI>Anthony,</HI> (who obtain'd <HI>Celtica Gallia</HI> for his part of
the Empire) when he enter'd the City on a Tri|umphant
Chariot drawn by twelve <HI>Lions;</HI> and he
afterwards caus'd Money to be coin'd in the &s;ame
place, of which I have &s;een &s;ome Pieces, bearing his
Figure on one &s;ide, and on the other a <HI>Lion,</HI> with
the Word <HI>Lugduni.</HI> The Town it &s;elf neither is,
nor can be made very &s;trong; but 'tis comman|ded
by three good Ca&s;tles which defend its Ave|nues.
The fir&s;t is the famous Fort of <HI>Peter An|ci&s;e,</HI>
<PB N="40" REF="37">
built on the top of a &s;teep Mountain, with
the rare Advantage of an excellent Spring of Wa|ter;
the &s;econd is that of S. <HI>Seba&s;tian;</HI> and the
third has the Name of S. <HI>Clair.</HI></P>
<P>I intended to have gone directly from <HI>Lions</HI> to
<HI>Geneva;</HI> but I &s;oon found that I cou'd not pro|&s;ecute
that De&s;ign without throwing my &s;elf
into unavoidable Dangers; for the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> are &s;o
narrowly watch'd every where, that 'tis ab&s;olutely
impo&s;&s;ible to travel thither without a Pa&s;s-port, un|le&s;s
a Man were Ma&s;ter of the Invention of fly|ing
thro' the Air. Nor is it very &s;afe to demand
a Pa&s;s-port of the Archbi&s;hop; for very lately he
order'd two Merchants to be apprehended, for
no other rea&s;on than that they were going to <HI>Ge|neva.</HI>
That <HI>Name</HI> alone is &s;ufficient to make any
Man pa&s;s for a <HI>Heretick</HI> that dares venture to
pronounce it; and he may reckon him&s;elf favour|ably
treated if his Crime be not immediately
judg'd worthy of the <HI>Gallows.</HI> You cannot ima|gine
with what care I avoid the mentioning of
&s;o dangerous a Word; and, I a&s;&s;ure you, I'm &s;o
much in Love with the Principle of <HI>Self-pre&s;erva|tion,</HI>
that I talk of nothing but <HI>Rome;</HI> and pre|tend
that the only De&s;ign of my Travels is to
wait upon the Duke <HI>de Cha&ucirc;nes.</HI></P>
<P>All this Caution, and the Commotions that
at pre&s;ent di&s;turb this Country, are occa&s;ion'd
by the return of the <HI>Vaudois,</HI> who arming them|&s;elves
in the Canton of <HI>Bern</HI> in <HI>Switzerland,</HI> with
a Secrecy that prevented even the Su&s;picions of
their Enemies, form'd two Bodies, one of 1200,
and the other of 3000 Men; and embarking on
the Lake of <HI>Geneva,</HI> forc'd their way thro' <HI>Savoy</HI>
to their own Country, in &s;pite of the uni|ted
Forces of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Savoy,</HI> who oppos'd their
Pa&s;&s;age, and oblig'd 'em to five or &s;ix Battels,
or rather Skirmi&s;hes, in which the <HI>Vaudois</HI> had
<PB N="41" REF="37">
&s;till the Advantage; but all tho&s;e who were
caught &s;traggling were made to pay for their Fel|lows,
and immediately hang'd without Mercy.
'Tis impo&s;&s;ible for a con&s;idering Per&s;on to reflect
without amazement, on the Succe&s;s of that En|terprize.
The fir&s;t Body of tho&s;e poor Exiles had
&s;o little Experience in the Management of War|like
Expeditions, that there was not one Officer
among 'em to conduct the re&s;t; for they had no
other Commanders but one Mon&s;ieur <HI>Arnaud,</HI> a
Mini&s;ter, and under him a Ma&s;on, nam'd <HI>Turel,</HI>
for their Lieutenant-General. Judge, Sir, whether
&s;uch doughty Captains were fitted for the At|chievement
of an Attempt, which a Triple num|ber
of regulated Troops dur&s;t not have undertaken.
This Con&s;ideration makes me very inclinable to
believe that the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> not only knew and
allow'd, but was the Promoter, and even the Au|thor
of their De&s;ign; e&s;pecially &s;ince 'tis plain
that he might have ea&s;ily prevented the Execu|tion
of it, by cutting off their Pa&s;&s;age, and ma|king
'em peri&s;h in the Mountains.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid enough to convince you, that 'tis
not &s;afe for me to pro&s;ecute my intended Jour|ney
to <HI>Geneva;</HI> however I'll leave no means un|e&s;&s;ay'd,
to get out of the limits of <HI>France,</HI> and to
break thro' all the Difficulties that lie in my
Way. In pur&s;uance of that De&s;ign, which I con|fe&s;s
&s;eems in a manner impracticable, I'm re&s;olv'd
at all Adventures to go to <HI>Grenoble,</HI> that I may

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Acquainted you in my la&s;t with my Re&s;oluti|tion
to continue my Journey to <HI>Grenoble.</HI> At
my departure from <HI>Lions</HI> I hir'd a <HI>Po&s;t-A&s;s</HI> at
S. <HI>Siforins,</HI> out of pure Curio&s;ity to try &s;o rare
an Experiment: Tho' I mu&s;t confe&s;s this way of
Travelling is not altogether without its Advanta|ges;
for the Rider may boldly venture a Fall,
without running the hazard of breaking his Neck.
I pa&s;s'd thro' <HI>Vienne,</HI> a very Ancient City, and
of Old much e&s;teem'd by the <HI>Romans,</HI> notwith|&s;tanding
its di&s;advantageous Situation at the
bottom of two great Mountains, which dar|ken
the Place extremely. <HI>Pilate,</HI> the Governour
of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and our Saviour's Judge, was after|wards
&s;ent hither; and they &s;till &s;how the <HI>Prae|torium,</HI>
or Hall of Ju&s;tice, where he was wont to
pronounce Judgment. There is a round Stone in
the Wall with this In&s;cription, <HI>This is the Globe of
Pilate's Scepter;</HI> tho' its unfitne&s;s for &s;uch an U&s;e
makes me rather inclinable to believe, that the
In&s;cription &s;peaks of the Hou&s;e, which might be
call'd <HI>The Globe of a Sceptre,</HI> by way of Figure or
Allu&s;ion. They al&s;o make Strangers take notice
of a &s;quare Tower, where they pretend he ended
his Days, after an Impri&s;onment of Seven Years.
The City is full of &s;uch-like Antiquities, which
are the only things in it that de&s;erve a Travel|ler's
Ob&s;ervation; for the Buildings are very in|con&s;iderable.
S. <HI>Severus's</HI> Church &s;tands in a Place
where formerly the <HI>Heathens</HI> ador'd a <HI>Hundred Gods,</HI>
under a great Tree, that was afterwards cut
<PB N="43" REF="38">
down and rooted up by that Saint's Order, as
appears by this In&s;cription on a Column:
<Q>Arborem Deos Severus evertit<LB>
Centum Deorum.</Q></P>
<P>There goes a Story, that under that Tree there
was found a <HI>Death's-Head,</HI> full of Gold and Sil|ver,
with which the Church was built. I will
not pretend to demon&s;trate the fal&s;ene&s;s of this
Tradition; but I think I may venture to conclude,
that either the Head was very big, or the Wages
of Workmen in tho&s;e Days very low; for &s;uch a
Structure cou'd not now be erected for &s;ixty thou|&s;and
Crowns.</P>
<P>Without the City, in a place call'd <HI>The Field de
l' Aguill&eacute;,</HI> there is an high <HI>Pyramid,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of
&s;everal Stones join'd together without Mortar or
Cement, and &s;upported by an Ancient Vault of
the &s;ame kind of Architecture, re&s;embling a little
Chapel. The Inhabitants of <HI>Vienne</HI> pretend that
this Pyramid was erected by an Emperour, with
a De&s;ign that his A&s;hes &s;hou'd be plac'd in an

the Kings of <HI>France,</HI> among the re&s;t of their Ti|tles,
&s;tyle them&s;elves <HI>Dauphins of Viennois.</HI></P>
<P>From thence continuing my Journey, mounted
as before, at the rate of five <HI>Sous</HI> by the Stage,
<PB N="44" REF="39">
which is the ordinary Price; I and my A&s;s had
the Fortune to meet with a Couple of Fellow-Travellers.
Immediately I acco&s;ted my Compa|nion,
and finding nothing either in his Mien or Di|&s;cour&s;e
that de&s;erv'd Contempt, I concluded that
he was a Merchant of <HI>Lions</HI> or <HI>Grenoble.</HI> About
two Hours after our Meeting, perceiving at a con|&s;iderable
di&s;tance a Coach drawn by Six Hor&s;es,
and attended with &s;ome Hor&s;emen, coming to|wards
us, he pre&s;ently alighted, and turn'd his
A&s;s loo&s;e: Then &s;hrinking up one of his Arms,
and turning it awry, as if he had been Lame, he
walk'd bare-headed to the Boot of the Coach, and
begg'd Charity of the Pa&s;&s;engers. I was extreme|ly
&s;urpriz'd at &s;o odd and unexpected an Action,
nor cou'd I divine the Meaning of it; for I
thought it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible that a Man, who, I
imagin'd, was neither Poor nor Sick, cou'd be
guilty of &s;o much Ba&s;ene&s;s: However, &s;ince my
Bea&s;t had already carry'd me &s;o far, that I cou'd
not ob&s;erve di&s;tinctly what he &s;aid or did, I re|&s;olv'd
to &s;u&s;pend my Judgment till I &s;hou'd learn
the rea&s;on of it from his own Mouth. A&s;&s;oon
as he came up, I ask'd what he went to do at
the Coach; <HI>Somewhat,</HI> reply'd he, <HI>that will doubt|le&s;s
&s;urprize you: Perhaps you did not believe me to be
a profe&s;s'd Beggar; yet I a&s;&s;ure you I have no other
Trade; and if you &s;tay at</HI> Grenoble, <HI>you may be a
Witne&s;s of my Diligence in that Vocation. I'm going
to the Ho&s;pital in that City, where I'm &s;ure of a Lodg|ing,
for three Days, during which I hope to get three
Pi&s;toles.</HI> I was no le&s;s a&s;toni&s;h'd at what I heard
him &s;ay, than at what I had already &s;een him
do: But he went on with the &s;ame Frankne&s;s,
and told me the whole Hi&s;tory of his Life. He
&s;aid he was born at <HI>Avignon,</HI> of a con&s;iderable Fa|mily
in that City, and that he had actually a
Revenue of above 200 Livres; that during his
<PB N="45" REF="39">
Infancy he had &s;o &s;trong an Inclination to Beg|ging,
that he u&s;ually &s;tole away from his Father
and Mother to ask Alms on the High-ways;
where he &s;ometimes pick'd up twenty or thirty
<HI>Sous</HI> a Day, which made him &s;o fond of that
Cour&s;e of Life, that he cou'd never afterwards
leave it. He a&s;&s;ur'd me, that the Trade of
Begging was attended at lea&s;t with as much
Plea&s;ure as Pain; and that he was &s;o accu|&s;tom'd
to it, that he was re&s;olv'd to make it
the only Bu&s;ine&s;s of his Life. In the mean
time I hearken'd to him with an Admira|tion
that wou'd not &s;uffer me to inter|rupt
him; and he &s;crupl'd not to acquaint me
with mo&s;t of the u&s;ual Tricks of his <HI>Fellow-Vaga|bonds.</HI>
They &s;pend their whole Lives in wandring
from one Ho&s;pital to another, and know exactly
all the Cu&s;toms of tho&s;e Places, and the various
Offices of Charity that were appointed by the
Founders to be perform'd in 'em. Some of 'em
cover them&s;elves with Rags, and putting their
Arms or Legs out of Joint, take up their Po&s;t at
a Church Door from Morning to Night, while
others go about in a pretty decent Garb, and
pretending to be poor Officers who have been
robb'd of their Money, and are at a great di&s;tance
from their Friends and Relations, beg the Chari|table
A&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e whom they meet, with
a certain Ba&s;hfulne&s;s, and mournful Tone, that
deceives many well-di&s;pos'd Per&s;ons. He that in|&s;tructed
me in all the&s;e My&s;teries, was of the Se|cond
Order, and contemn'd the others as a &s;ort
of <HI>Puny Mumpers,</HI> who had neither Courage nor
Ambition: Adding, that he got more in a Day
that the be&s;t of them cou'd do in a whole Month.
Neverthele&s;s the&s;e <HI>Strolers</HI> depend not wholly on
Charity; they have another Trade which is no
le&s;s Gainful than Begging, I mean the &s;elling of
<PB N="46" REF="40">
<HI>Pa&s;s-Ports</HI> to Travellers. My Companion percei|ving
that I had none, de&s;ir'd me to buy one of
him; and at the fir&s;t Inn where we alighted,
&s;hew'd me at lea&s;t a Hundred. I ask'd him the
Price of One: <HI>There are &s;ome,</HI> an&s;wer'd he, <HI>of all
Prices, as well as other Commodities; for &s;ome are Au|thentick,
others forg'd; &s;ome of an old, others of a fre&s;h
Date; and if you will be &s;atisfy'd with &s;uch as are
Counterfeit, you &s;hall have 'em for fifteen</HI> Sous <HI>a-piece.</HI>
I thank'd him for his Ingenuity; but told him,
that I cou'd not tru&s;t to a fal&s;e <HI>Pa&s;s-Port. Yet
they are as &s;ure as the re&s;t,</HI> an&s;wer'd he, <HI>for they
are never call'd in Que&s;tion; and all the Authentick</HI>
Pa&s;s-Ports <HI>I have, are procur'd on the Credit of &s;uch
as I wrote with my own Hand, for otherwi&s;e they
wou'd not give me any: However, you may plea&s;e your
&s;elf both in the Choice and Goodne&s;s of your Commodi|ty;
for I have &s;ome for all Places.</HI> Then I ask'd him
one for <HI>Geneva;</HI> but he told me, that to his great
Sorrow and Lo&s;s, 'twas impo&s;&s;ible to obtain one
for that Place; a&s;&s;uring me, that if he had a
Hundred of 'em, he cou'd di&s;po&s;e of 'em all at
the Rate of Ten Pi&s;toles a-piece. At la&s;t I gave
him two Pi&s;toles for a <HI>Pa&s;s-Port</HI> to <HI>Rome,</HI> preten|ded
to be granted by the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Lions</HI> to one
<HI>Bidault,</HI> and afterwards ratify'd and approv'd at <HI>Vienne.</HI>
He &s;wore and prote&s;ted that 'twou'd infallibly pro|cure
me an unque&s;tion'd Pa&s;&s;age; but the extream
de&s;ire I had to make my E&s;cape out of <HI>France</HI> ra|ther
than any Credit I gave to his A&s;&s;everations,
made me willing to run the Hazard; tho', after
all, I apprehended the Danger to be greater than
it really was: For a&s;&s;oon as I pre&s;ented my coun|terfeit
<HI>Pa&s;s-Port</HI> to the Marque&s;s <HI>de S. Andr&eacute;,</HI> he
granted me another without the lea&s;t Difficulty, ap|pointing
me to pa&s;s thro' <HI>Chambery, S. John de Mo|rienne,</HI>
and <HI>Turin.</HI></P>

<HI>Grenoble</HI> became the Capital City of <HI>Dauphin&eacute;,</HI>
when <HI>Charles</HI> VII. e&s;tabli&s;h'd a Parliament in it,
and has ever &s;ince continu'd in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
that Dignity. This Country was bequeath'd to
King <HI>Philip de Valois,</HI> by <HI>Humbert,</HI> the la&s;t Prince
of <HI>Dauphine,</HI> on condition that from thenceforth
the Pre&s;umptive Heir of the Crown of <HI>France,</HI>
&s;hou'd be &s;til'd <HI>Dauphin of Viennois;</HI> and bear in
his Coat-Armorial the Arms of <HI>France</HI> quarter'd
with tho&s;e of <HI>Dauphin&eacute;,</HI> which are, Or, <HI>a Dolphin</HI>
Azure, <HI>Cre&s;ted, Finn'd, and Ear'd</HI> Gules. The Tomb
of <HI>Andrew, Humbert's</HI> Son, is in the Church of the
<HI>Dominicans</HI> that fronts the <HI>Place de Grenette,</HI> which
is the fine&s;t in <HI>Grenoble,</HI> both for its Largene&s;s, and
the Magnificence of the Building with which 'tis
adorn'd, e&s;pecially the Parliament-Hou&s;e, to which
you enter thro' a Court, border'd with Shops full
of all &s;orts of Commodities: 'Tis of an Antique
Structure, and the Chambers are very well fur|ni&s;h'd.
The Governour's Hou&s;e is large, and
has the Advantage of a very plea&s;ant Pro&s;pect.
The Epi&s;copal Church of <HI>N&ocirc;tre-Dame</HI> is another
Piece of Architecture remarkable for its Antiqui|ty.
But after all, 'tis certain that the principal
Glory of <HI>Grenoble</HI> con&s;i&s;ts not in its Buildings;
and they who wou'd have the plea&s;ure to be ac|quainted
with all its Beauty, mu&s;t not expect
to gratifie their Curio&s;ity by a Tran&s;ient View
of it. For it has the Honour to be the Seat of
&s;everal Noble Families, who are &s;o far above the
Clowni&s;hne&s;s that might be expected in &s;o remote
a Province, that their Conver&s;ation and Deport|ment
may be ju&s;tly reckon'd the Standard of Ci|vility
and good Breeding: So that a Stranger is
amaz'd to find the mo&s;t refin'd Politene&s;s of the
Court in the mid&s;t of tho&s;e wild Mountains.
'Tis &s;eated on the Banks of <HI>I&s;&s;ere,</HI> in a Valley, which
my Natural aver&s;ion to all Hilly Countries will not
<PB N="48" REF="41">
&s;uffer me to call Plea&s;ant. Yet at my departure
from the City, I &s;aw &s;ome places that mu&s;t be
acknowledged to have a kind of di&s;mal Beauty,
e&s;pecially the Mona&s;tery of the <HI>Carthu&s;ians.</HI> The
very A&s;cent to it is a Journey of &s;ix Hours, thro'
Ways that are almo&s;t only pa&s;&s;able for Mules,
which are very common and extremely fine in
this Country: At lea&s;t I can a&s;&s;ure you, that
tho&s;e who live in it may for ever de&s;pair of &s;ee|ing
any Coach or Waggon near their Habitation,
unle&s;s it be made upon the Place. The&s;e Moun|tains,
that &s;eem to have been appointed by Na|ture
as a wild Retreat for Wolves and Boars, are
neverthele&s;s inhabited by Humane Creatures, if I
may give that Name to Animals that &s;eem to have
a nearer re&s;emblance to Bears than Men. Their
Habit con&s;i&s;ts of &s;o Cour&s;e a Cloth, that they ne|ver
wear above one Suit of Clothes during their
whole Life, tho' it &s;hou'd la&s;t an hundred Years.
'Tis a certain reddi&s;h Stuff, of the thickne&s;s of two
Crown Pieces, and every Thread in it is at lea&s;t
as big as Packthread. The&s;e mi&s;erable Wretches
are perfect Strangers to all manner of Plea&s;ure:
Their main or only Happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in filling
their Stomachs with a &s;ort of Bread that none of
our Dogs wou'd ta&s;te; and even that is a Rarity
among 'em: They drink Water, and live Night
and Day in Huts of Straw in the mid&s;t of their
Oxen, Cows, and Hogs, which are their u&s;ual
Companions, and are utterly unacquainted with
the Tran&s;actions of the re&s;t of Mankind.</P>
<P>'Tis impo&s;&s;ible to approach the Mona&s;tery with|out
feeling an over-bearing Melancholy that damps
the gaye&s;t Spirits: 'tis &s;eated between two high and
rugged Mountains or rather perpendicular Rocks,
and the Gha&s;tline&s;s of the Pro&s;pect is heighten'd by
the Pine-Trees, that ca&s;t a di&s;mal Shade upon the
jutting Cliffs. And to compleat the Horrour of
<PB N="49" REF="41">
the Place, the Ears are &s;tunn'd with the amazing
Dinn of a Torrent that rolls impetuou&s;ly thro' the
Bottom which &s;eparates the Mountains. The <HI>Monks</HI>
have &s;par'd no Pains to cut a Way thro' tho&s;e na|turally
impa&s;&s;able Precipices; and 'tis certain that
&s;o laborious a Work cou'd not be perform'd without
a va&s;t Expence of Trea&s;ure. However they cannot
be accus'd of throwing away their Money upon
u&s;ele&s;s Projects; for, if you except the trouble of
a&s;cending and de&s;cending, a Man may walk pretty
ea&s;ily to the Convent from the Bridges that are
built at the two Ends, and in the narrowe&s;t Places
at the Bottom, e&s;pecially that next <HI>Grenoble,</HI> which
joins the oppo&s;ite Mountains with a little Arch that
over-looks the Torrent, and is commanded by a
Hou&s;e at the End of the Bridge, which Ten Men
might defend again&s;t a Hundred thou&s;and. Nor is the
Pa&s;&s;age to the Convent le&s;s difficult on the other &s;ide,
&s;o that it might be ju&s;tly e&s;teem'd a very con&s;idera|ble
Po&s;t, if it were as important as 'tis &s;trong: but
in my Opinion the U&s;ele&s;ne&s;s of the Conque&s;t &s;e|cures
it as effectually again&s;t the Attacks of an Ene|my,
as the Strength of its Situation. The&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages
end in a &s;ort of Meadow or little Valley, contain|ing
a hundred Paces in breadth, and a large quarter
of a League in length, where the Mona&s;tery is &s;eat|ed.
The <HI>Monks</HI> have made &s;everal &s;ucce&s;sle&s;s At|tempts
to cultivate and embelli&s;h their &s;olitary
Abode; which are &s;o many convincing Proofs of
the Badne&s;s of the Soil, that makes it incapable
of Improvement. However, they &s;till continue to
encrea&s;e their Buildings, for they have the Advan|tage
of Wood, Stones, and Iron upon the Spot, be|&s;ides
the Conveniency of Mills, that are turn'd by a
&s;mall Torrent which pa&s;&s;es by the Convent, and
furni&s;hes 'em plentifully with Water. I'm per&s;wa|ded
they cannot eat one half of their Yearly Re|venue,
which amounts to 300000 Livres: tho' Gen|tlemen

after which he left me to repo&s;e.</P>
<P>Next Morning about Nine a-clock he return'd,

his Penance, which is not acce&s;&s;ible with|out
great difficulty, being on the Top of the
Mountain, and &s;o extremely Cold, that I cannot
imagine it was ever inhabited by Men. Never|thele&s;s
the&s;e Fathers a&s;&s;ur'd me, that 'twas the con|&s;tant
Habitation of that Saint, with his Six Com|panions;
and &s;hew'd me certain Caves or <HI>Grotto's</HI>
cut out of the Rock, where they &s;pent their Days
in the Exerci&s;e of Religious Au&s;terities. Since
that time the Monks erected a very fine Chapel,
enrich'd with &s;everal Pictures; among which that
of the Saint him&s;elf is particularly remarkable for
its fini&s;h'd Beauty. They forget not to make
Strangers take notice of their Rock, on which, if
you can believe their Tradition, an Angel appear'd
to him every Day, and brought him his nece&s;&s;ary
Food. But it &s;eems his Companions were not &s;o
much in love with Mortification; for after his
Death they left the Hermitage, and de|&s;cended
half a League lower, to the place where

Contemplation, and the Severities of Repentance;

almo&s;t impregnable; for it &s;eems to be plac'd out
of the reach of all other Enemies but Famine,
and want of Provi&s;ions: But the Town, that is
&s;eated below, is a Place of no Defence, and much
le&s;s con&s;iderable than a Thou&s;and Villages in <HI>France.
S. John de Morienne,</HI> where I arriv'd the next Day,
de&s;erves no better Character, tho' it be honour'd with
a Bi&s;hop's See. Here I took another Pa&s;s-Port of
the great Vicar, which I may reckon cheap, tho'
it co&s;t me very dear; for it brought me &s;afe to
this place, without being at the Charge of renew|ing
it.</P>
<P>Two Days after I arriv'd at the Village of <HI>Lane|burg,</HI>
&s;eated directly at the Foot of Mount <HI>Cennis.</HI>
This remarkable Hill is famous both for its height,
in which re&s;pect it exceeds the talle&s;t Mountains
of the <HI>Alps;</HI> and for a Bottomle&s;s Lake, &s;ituated in
<PB N="54" REF="44">
the middle of its Surface. I a&s;cended a League
and a half before I arriv'd at the Lake; after
which I found a Plain; extending about a large
League; and in that an Inn, where I was accommo|dated
with the mo&s;t de&s;irable Entertainment in
the&s;e Mountains, I mean the warmth of a good
Fire; for the Way is lin'd on both &s;ides with va&s;t
Hills of Snow; and the Wind is &s;o cold and pier|cing,
that the poor Traveller is hardly able to &s;up|port
him&s;elf on his numm'd Limbs. After I had
re&s;ted an Hour, I mounted my Mule, for there
are no other Bea&s;ts of Carriage able to pa&s;s the
Mountain; and found the De&s;cent on the other
&s;ide as trouble&s;ome and unea&s;ie as the A&s;cent, which
I have already de&s;crib'd.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Evening I arriv'd at <HI>Suza,</HI> a little Ci|ty
in the Frontiers of <HI>Piedmont,</HI> &s;eated at the Foot
of a Mountain, and &s;eparated from <HI>Turin</HI> by a va&s;t
and fertil Plain: It has the Advantage of a pure
and healthy Air, plea&s;ant Meadows, good Wine,
and beautiful Hou&s;es. The warmth of the Cli|mate
exceeds that of <HI>France,</HI> but the Heat is not
&s;o intollerable as at <HI>Rome;</HI> &s;o that the Traveller
finds as great an Alteration at his De&s;cent from
the Mountains of <HI>Savoy,</HI> as if he were tran&s;ported
in an In&s;tant from <HI>Norway</HI> to <HI>Italy;</HI> and is agree|ably
ravi&s;h'd at the &s;udden Change of a &s;tormy
Winter into a Mild and Temperate Spring.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Turin</HI> is &s;eated at the other end of
this charming Plain, between the <HI>Po</HI> and the <HI>Loire,</HI>
which furni&s;h it abundantly with all the Nece&s;&s;a|ries
and Conveniences of Life. 'Tis enclos'd with
&s;trong Walls, and &s;urrounded with broad, deep,
and well-lin'd Ditches. The Cittadel is a Ma&s;ter|piece
of Fortification; for the Duke has &s;par'd no
Co&s;t to make it Strong and Magnificent; and if
the Goodne&s;s of the Soil had been &s;uitable to the
Care he has taken to improve it, I'm confident
<PB N="55" REF="44">
'twou'd have been ab&s;olutely impregnable. The
Town is all glorious within, and adorn'd with a
Thou&s;and Beauties: The Publick Places are &s;pa|cious,
all newly built with an admirable Regulari|ty:
The Streets are broad, and &s;treight as a Line:
The noble&s;t improvements of Architecture are mag|nificently
di&s;play'd in the Palaces; the Gilding,
Paintings, and other Ornaments of the Churches are
&s;uitable to the Beauty of the Buildings; the Shops
are full of all &s;orts of rich and fine Stuffs; and
the Academies for riding the Great Hor&s;e, Dan|cing,
and Martial Exerci&s;es, de&s;erve a particular
Ob&s;ervation. And to compleat the Glories of the
Place, there is a Court, that, notwith&s;tanding its
&s;mallne&s;s, may be ju&s;tly reckon'd the Seat of Gal|lantry
and Politene&s;s; 'Tis compos'd of a Society
of both Sexes, that are equally Admirable; the
Ladies for their re&s;i&s;tle&s;s Charms; and the Men
for a Noblene&s;s of Mien, and Magnificence of Garb,
that &s;eems peculiar to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, I have endeavour'd to give you in
few Words, a ju&s;t <HI>Idea</HI> of this Charming City;
for it wou'd be an endle&s;s Labour to undertake
the particular De&s;cription of every fine Church,
and beautiful Palace, in a place where &s;uch Stru|ctures
are no Rarities. All the Ornaments of this
City are Modern; at lea&s;t I cou'd not, upon the
&s;tricte&s;t Enquiry, di&s;cover any other Antiquities
than tho&s;e in the Duke's Gallery, which is full
of all &s;orts of fine Paintings, rare Munu&s;cripts,
Medals, Va&s;es, and other Curio&s;ities of that Na|ture.
The Gate of the Palace is defended with
two Culverins, admirable for their Largene&s;s and
Workman&s;hip; and a Mortar of a prodigious big|ne&s;s.
The Metropolitan Church is dedicated to
S. <HI>John,</HI> and exceeds all the re&s;t in Magnificence:
'Tis a &s;tately Dome, enrich'd on the In&s;ide with
Paintings, of a fini&s;h'd Regularity and Finene&s;s:
<PB N="56" REF="45">
And to all the other Ornaments, there was lately
added a Chapel of a &s;urprizing Beauty and Rich|ne&s;s.
This admirable Structure is of an excellent
Architecture, and &s;eems in a manner to be over|laid
with a glittering Cover of Gold and Silver:
'Twas built on purpo&s;e for the <HI>Holy Handkerchief,</HI>
which is kept there at pre&s;ent. You cannot ima|gine
with what Devotion the People of this Place
adorn that Relick; which is a little Sheet, with
the Image of our Saviour painted very imperfect|ly
in the middle, of a yellowi&s;h Colour. I need
not tell you that this is commonly pretended to be
the &s;ame Cloth in which Chri&s;t's Face was wrapt
at his Burial, and that his Image was miracu|lou&s;ly
&s;tamp'd upon it: But there are &s;o many
other Pretenders to the &s;ame Dignity, that I
will not undertake to decide &s;o doubtful a Con|trover&s;ie.</P>
<P>According to all Appearance, the Duke of <HI>Sa|v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">y</HI>
will not remain long in the King's Intere&s;ts;
for he has already given out Commi&s;&s;ions for the
levying of two Regiments of Foot, and one of
Dragoons, with an expre&s;s Order, not to receive
a <HI>Frenchman</HI> into 'em; and be&s;ides, 'tis certain
that he did not oppo&s;e the Pa&s;&s;age of the <HI>Bar|bets,</HI>
as he might have ea&s;ily done: For all the
Motions of his Troops, were only in Order to
their Encampment at <HI>Verecil;</HI> and I'm per&s;uaded
the only rea&s;on why he &s;uffer'd the <HI>French</HI> to act
on that Occa&s;ion, was becau&s;e he cou'd not hin|der
'em.</P>
<P>I have met with another Ob&s;tacle, that will re|tard
my Journey to <HI>I&s;aly</HI> for &s;ome time; for the
whole Country is full of <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who Infe&s;t all
the Roads, and commit a Thou&s;and Robberies.
The People here are daily alarm'd with fre&s;h Ac|counts
of the&s;e Di&s;orders; &s;o that I have been
at la&s;t prevail'd with to alter my Re&s;olution, and
<PB N="57" REF="45">
am going to take Journey for <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> where
I'm certainly inform'd I may find daily Oppor|tunities

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>DUring my &s;hort &s;tay at <HI>Turin</HI> after the Wri|ing
of my la&s;t Letter, I had not the Op|portunity
of making any remarkable Ob&s;ervation
that I had not taken notice of before; and there|fore
all that I &s;hall add to the Account I gave
you of that City, is, that the People have an
extraordinary Love to their Sovereign. You'll per|haps
tell me, that this is not a very uncommon
Ob&s;ervation, &s;ince 'tis natural for all Men to re|&s;pect
their Governours: But I hope you'll acknow|ledge,
that there are various Degrees in this kind
of Affection, as well as in all others; and that I
cannot be accus'd of Trifling, when I a&s;&s;ure you,
that never was the Brea&s;t of any Subject fill'd
with a more ardent and re&s;pectful Love to his
Prince, than that which the Inhabitants of <HI>Pied|mont</HI>
have for the Duke of <HI>Savoy.</HI> Nor is their
Zeal for his Intere&s;t, and Affection to his Per|&s;on,
the Effect of a blind Inclination: For 'tis
no wonder that tho&s;e who owe their Happine&s;s
to the mild Influences of his Government are
charm'd with the Greatne&s;s of his Courage and
<PB N="58" REF="46">
Magnamity, and a Thou&s;and other rare Perfecti|ons,
of which he is certainly Ma&s;ter in a very emi|nent
Degree.</P>
<P>The Dutche&s;s is an illu&s;trious Example of Con|jugal
Affection: 'tis true, &s;he is not unmindful of
the Blood that fills her Veins; nor will ever for|get
that Natural Inclination to the place of her
Nativity, that obliges her to be the declar'd Pro|tectre&s;s
of the <HI>French:</HI> But her Love to her Coun|try
is not &s;trong enough to le&s;&s;en that which &s;he
owes to her Lord, and puts not the lea&s;t Bya&s;s on
her Mind when it comes in Competition with his
Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>I forgot to tell you in my la&s;t, that it Rains
almo&s;t perpetually at <HI>Turin;</HI> and, (whatever you
may think on't) this is a very important Remark
for Per&s;ons of my Humour and Fortune. I can|not
forbear complaining of the Unkindne&s;s of my
De&s;tiny, that expo&s;es me to be drench'd with e|very
Shower for want of a Coach, and even en|vying
the Happine&s;s of tho&s;e who are better pro|vided;
for, if God had thought fit to intru&s;t me
with the Management of 10000 Livres a Year, I
wou'd not have deny'd my &s;elf the Plea&s;ure of Tra|velling
in a portable Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>From <HI>Turin</HI> I came in &s;even Hours to <HI>Pignerol.</HI>
The Town is very well fortify'd; and the Citta|del,
as now it &s;tands, after &s;o many Additions and
Alterations, may be ju&s;tly reckon'd one of the
&s;tronge&s;t places in his Maje&s;ty's Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and a
terrible Thorn in the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI>'s Foot, which
may one Day make him halt, if he do not take
care to pluck it out. Here the unfortunate Mon|&s;ieur
<HI>Fouquet</HI> &s;pent the la&s;t part of his Life, and
(as 'tis generally believ'd) compos'd that admira|ble
Treati&s;e, entitul'd, <HI>The Coun&s;els of Wi&s;dom.</HI> If
that Report be true, even his Enemies mu&s;t ac|knowledge,
that the Confinement of his Body di|&s;turb'd
<PB N="59" REF="46">
not the Freedom and Tranquillity of his
Mind, and that he was entirely di&s;engag'd from
the Allurements of this World. Neverthele&s;s, I'm
certainly inform'd by Per&s;ons of un&s;u&s;pected Cre|dit,
that he attempted to make his E&s;cape by cut|ting
the Sheets of his Bed; and that he was after|wards
put under a Guard of four Centinels in&s;tead
of one, as well as the Count <HI>de Lau&s;un,</HI> who about
four Years ago had little rea&s;on to flatter him&s;elf
with the hopes of a Relea&s;e. The Marque&s;s <HI>d'Her|ville,</HI>
the pre&s;ent Governour of <HI>Pignerol,</HI> is a Man
of a large and comely Stature, brave, and well ac|quainted
with the Duties of his Office.</P>
<P>Leaving <HI>Pignerol</HI> I proceeded on my Journey thro'
the long Valley of <HI>Se&s;triere</HI> to <HI>Guille&s;tre,</HI> and from
thence by the Way of <HI>Brian&ccedil;on</HI> to <HI>Ambrun,</HI> a little
City on the Frontiers of <HI>Dauphin&eacute;,</HI> inacce&s;&s;ible on
one &s;ide, by rea&s;on of the Steepne&s;s of the Rock on
which 'tis built, but only defended on the other
with a weak and &s;ingle Wall. The Archbi&s;hoprick
of this Place is at pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by <HI>Mon&s;ieur de
Genlis,</HI> Nephew to the Marque&s;s <HI>de Genlis,</HI> Lieute|nant-General
of his Maje&s;ty's Forces, and Captain-Lieutenant
of the Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI>'s Company of
<HI>Geudarms.</HI> This Prelate &s;ignaliz'd his Courage and
Zeal in the late Campaign again&s;t the <HI>Vaudois;</HI> for
he remain'd in the Camp all the Summer, and was
per&s;onally engag'd in the Battel of <HI>Salbertrand:</HI> And
this unu&s;ual Bravery in a Man of his Character, has
procur'd him &s;o much Honour and Authority in the
Country, that when I produc'd his Pa&s;s-Port at
<HI>Gap,</HI> the Major, who commanded in the Place, told
me that if it had been &s;ign'd by the King him&s;elf
it wou'd not have been &s;o much re&s;pected. 'Tis true
he gave me a very favourable Character, for he was
not ignorant that I had the Honour to be very well
known to his Uncle: and 'twas al&s;o on that Score
<PB N="60" REF="47">
that he kept me two days at <HI>Ambrun,</HI> and entertain'd
me with a great deal of Kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t give me leave to detain you a while with
an Account of my fatiguing Pa&s;&s;age over Mount <HI>Ge|nevre:</HI>
for tho' it be neither &s;o large nor &s;o high as
<HI>Cenis,</HI> the cro&s;&s;ing of that Mountain put me to more
Trouble and Pain than ever I &s;uffer'd in any one
day of my Life. I was mounted on a Hor&s;e that
was not worth Six-pence, which I hir'd of a Pea|&s;ant
at <HI>Brian&ccedil;on,</HI> and accompany'd with a Guide
who was utterly unacquainted with the Roads, and
carry'd me quite out of the Way. But that was not
my greate&s;t Misfortune, for my Hor&s;e &s;tuck &s;o fa&s;t
in the Snow, which reach'd above his Belly, that
I cou'd not make him go one Step farther, and was
at la&s;t forc'd to alight and endeavour to open a Pa&s;|&s;age
for him to the High-way; for I perceiv'd cer|tain
Sticks at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, which (I knew)
were &s;et up as Marks to keep Travellers from wan|dring
out of the Road. But I quickly found my
De&s;ign impracticable, for both I and my Hor&s;e were
&s;o benumn'd with the Cold, that we cou'd hardly
&s;tir a Leg; and be&s;ides the Wind drove the Snow
upon me fa&s;ter than I cou'd rake it away: &s;o that
I was beginning to give over my u&s;ele&s;s Labour,
and to reflect in good earne&s;t on a Death that &s;eem'd
unavoidable, when I di&s;cover'd certain black Spots,
that gave me &s;ome hope of finding a Village not far
the place where I thought to have ended my days.
Immediately I left my Guide, Hor&s;e and Baggage,
and, feeble as I was, ventur'd into the mid&s;t of the
Snow, in que&s;t of tho&s;e Hou&s;es, where at la&s;t, by
God's A&s;&s;i&s;tance, I arriv'd, and was receiv'd with
all imaginable Marks of Kindne&s;s by tho&s;e Ho&s;pi|table
Wretches, who brought me into one of their
Hutts, which I found &s;tuff'd with Oxen, Cows,
Sheep, Cats, Dogs, and (the mo&s;t mi&s;erable Part
of the Family) Men and Women. Neverthele&s;s
<PB N="61" REF="47">
I a&s;&s;ure you that the Sight of this Place, which
perhaps at another time wou'd have turn'd my Sto|mach,
&s;eem'd more charming to me in that Ex|tremity,
than the mo&s;t glorious Palace that ever I be|held:
I fan&s;i'd my &s;elf re&s;tor'd from Death to Life
a&s;&s;oon as I enter'd that Re&s;emblance of a Hog's Stie,
which was as hot as a Stove. In the mean time I
begg'd &s;ome of my kind Ho&s;ts to compleat their
Charity, by going to relieve the Poor Creature,
whom I had left with my Hor&s;e in the mid&s;t of the
Snow: and their A&s;&s;i&s;tance came very &s;ea&s;onably,
for he had certainly peri&s;h'd if they had &s;tay'd half a
quarter of an hour longer. After I had the Satisfacti|on
of &s;eeing him alive, I &s;tretch'd my weary'd Body
on a Heap of Straw, where I enjoy'd the mo&s;t com|fortable
Night's Re&s;t that ever I had in my Life.
The next day I fea&s;ted on a Piece of Bread exactly of
the Colour of Soot, and a little dry and &s;alt Chee&s;e;
and was in the mean time entertain'd with an Ac|count
of their Way of Living in this Place. They
told me that they were impri&s;on'd in their di&s;mal
Habitations, and almo&s;t bury'd in the Snow for the
Space of &s;even Months, every Year; during which
time they linger out a mi&s;erable Life in the mid&s;t of
Stench and Na&s;tine&s;s.</P>
<P>After my Arrival at <HI>Gap,</HI> I &s;ent back my Hor&s;e,
and hir'd another, which I found there by chance,
to <HI>Si&s;teron.</HI> But to compleat the Misfortunes of my
di&s;a&s;trous Journey, as I was cro&s;&s;ing a very rapid
Torrent about a League from the la&s;t of the&s;e Pla|ces,
having occa&s;ion to blow my No&s;e, I pull'd
my Handkerchief out of my Pocket, and with that
the Box with my Pa&s;s-Ports, which fell into the
Stream, and was in an in&s;tant carry'd quite out of
my Sight. If my Pur&s;e with all the Money I was
Ma&s;ter of, had been irrecoverably lo&s;t, I cou'd not
have been more &s;en&s;ibly vex'd: for when I con&s;i|der'd
with what Rigour I had been every where ex|amin'd
<PB N="62" REF="48">
notwith&s;tanding my Pa&s;s-Ports, I concluded
that Impri&s;onment was the milde&s;t Treatment I
cou'd expect to receive at <HI>Si&s;teron.</HI> The&s;e Re|flexions
kept me for &s;ome time in an Irre&s;olution,
whether I &s;hou'd go forwards; but &s;ince the Danger
was equal either Way, I re&s;olv'd to proceed on my
Journey, tho' I &s;hou'd be forc'd to take up my
Lodging in a Gaol. I found, to my Co&s;t, the Ac|compli&s;hment
of tho&s;e Melancholick Pre&s;ages; for
the Governour laugh'd at my Excu&s;es, and told me
that I mu&s;t needs have a very mean Opinion of his
Judgment, if I thought to put him off with &s;uch
an ill-contriv'd Story. <HI>Confe&s;s the Truth,</HI> added he,
<HI>you are one of the</HI> Barbets, <HI>and are going to</HI> Langue|doc
<HI>and</HI> Dauphin&eacute;, <HI>to per&s;uade the new Converts in
tho&s;e Provinces to join with your Party:</HI> I an&s;wer'd,
That I was too Loyal a Subject to his Maje&s;ty, and
too zealous a Catholick to undertake &s;uch a Com|mi&s;&s;ion;
that I was a meer Stranger to the <HI>Barbets;</HI>
that I came from <HI>Turin,</HI> and was going to <HI>Rome.
What, Sir,</HI> reply'd he, <HI>you came from</HI> Turin? <HI>Mor|bleau,
you came with the</HI> Barbets: <HI>I'm better acquainted
with your Tricks than you imagine; I &s;ay you did come
with 'em, and I'll &s;hew you pre&s;ently &s;ome of your own
Friends, who will maintain it to your Face.</HI> Immedi|ately
he order'd two of tho&s;e unhappy Wretches
that were fall'n into his Hands, to be brought before
him, and a&s;&s;oon as they appear'd, <HI>Here is one of your
Officers,</HI> &s;aid he to 'em, <HI>whom we have caught &s;trag|gling.
He wou'd have us believe that he has de&s;erted
your Party, and left you with a De&s;ign to &s;ubmit to the
King; but we have Rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect his Sincerity. Con|fe&s;s
the Truth ingenuou&s;ly, and declare all that you know
concerning him, as the only way you can take to obtain the
King's Mercy.</HI> If I had been guilty of entertaining
a Corre&s;pondence with the&s;e People, I wou'd have
immediately &s;aid &s;omething to undeceive 'em, and
prevent their biting the Hook: but &s;ince I was alto|gether
<PB N="63" REF="48">
unacquainted with 'em, I was glad of that
Occa&s;ion to ju&s;tifie my Innocency, and expected
their An&s;wer with a Silence that confuted all my
Accu&s;ers: and be&s;ides, the Pri&s;oners affirm'd that
they did not know me. Then the Governour be|gan
to examine me more particularly, and with le&s;s
Prejudice than before: he ask'd me which way I
came, where I receiv'd Pa&s;s-Ports, and who had
any Knowledge of me. In an&s;wer to the la&s;t Que|&s;tion,
having nam'd &s;everal Per&s;ons, and among
the re&s;t the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Ambrun,</HI> the Governour
a&s;&s;ur'd me, that I might conclude my &s;elf out of
Danger, if that Prelate wou'd undertake to an&s;wer
for me; and I reply'd, that I hop'd he wou'd not deny
me his Te&s;timony. Then the Governour de&s;ir d me
to write to him, telling me that he wou'd accom|pany
my Letter with another, and that in the mean
time I &s;hou'd be confin'd to the Cittadel, where I
was lodg'd with two Lieutenants, from whom and
the re&s;t of the Officers, I receiv'd all imaginable
Marks of. Civility. Four days after, the Governour
having receiv'd a very favourable An&s;wer from the
Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Ambrun,</HI> &s;ent for me, and told me
that I was at Liberty to depart when I pleas'd. I
return'd him my very humble Thanks for the Ju&s;tice
he did me, and intreated him to grant me a Pa&s;s-Port,
&s;ince without that I &s;hou'd certainly be &s;topp'd,
and perhaps al&s;o abus'd by the fir&s;t <HI>Corps de Garde</HI> of
Pea&s;ants on the Road. But he a&s;&s;ur'd me that there
was no need of a Pa&s;s-Port, and that all the Roads
were free, from <HI>Si&s;teron</HI> to <HI>Mar&s;eilles.</HI></P>
<P>Since I have had occa&s;ion to mention the <HI>Bar|bets</HI>
&s;o often, I believe it will not be an unwel|come
Gratification of your Curio&s;ity, to give you

Meaning of his Name had once almo&s;t co&s;t him his

of good Wine; and be&s;ides, 'tis adorn'd with a con|&s;iderable
Number of new Hou&s;es, which are very
fine, and built after the <HI>Italian</HI> Fa&s;hion. The Nobi|lity
of <HI>Provence</HI> are, without di&s;pute, the greate&s;t
Lovers of <HI>Building</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> and are at the greate&s;t
Charge in gratifying their Inclinations to Archite|cture;
and there are in this Country a great Number
of admirably well-contriv'd Structures that may pa&s;s
for little Palaces. The Metropolitan Church, call'd
<HI>S. Saviour's,</HI> is particularly remarkable for the Tombs
of four Counts of <HI>Provence,</HI> a &s;mall &s;ubterraneous
Chapel, where 'tis &s;aid S. <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> ended her
Days, and e&s;pecially the <HI>Bapti&s;mal Font</HI> of white
Marble, adorn'd with <HI>Reliefs</HI> that are much e&s;teem'd
by the be&s;t Judges, and cover'd with a little Marble
Dome, &s;upported with Columns of the &s;ame, ma|king
all together a very valuable Piece. The <HI>Place
des Pr&ecirc;cheurs</HI> is the fine&s;t of all the &s;pacious Courts or
Squares in the City, both for its Neatne&s;s and Large|ne&s;s,
and for the Beauty of the Structures that &s;ur|round
it, among which the ancient <HI>Palace of Ju&s;tice</HI>
de&s;erves a particular Ob&s;ervation. In one of its A|partments,
where the Counts of <HI>Provence</HI> kept their
Re&s;idence, there is a very fine Room, at pre&s;ent
call'd, <HI>The King's Chamber,</HI> richly gilt, and hung

may vi&s;it the <HI>Cours,</HI> or publick Walking-Place and
Rendezvous of Coaches, which is 800 Paces long,
and 15 broad, without reck'ning the pav'd Streets on
both Sides for the Coaches. 'Tis enclos'd with Bal|li&s;ters

be&s;ides, at convenient Intervals, there are Benches

of the Parliament, which was e&s;tabli&s;h'd
here by <HI>Lewis</HI> XII. <HI>Ann.</HI> 1501. The Archbi&s;hoprick

<P>The Air of this Province is &s;o mild, that 'tis &s;el|dom

the Advantages of its Climate are con&s;iderably le&s;|&s;en'd
by the Boi&s;terou&s;ne&s;s of the Winds that reign
in it. And be&s;ides, the Country is generally &s;o
mountainous, that one half of it is not cultivated;
and the little fertil Ground that remains, is &s;o full
of Stones, that a Man wou'd be tempted to think
they had been purpo&s;ely brought thither. The La|bourers
take care to remove tho&s;e that lie in their
way, and, in&s;tead of Hedges, &s;urround their Fields
with Stone-Walls, which are almo&s;t every where
three Foot high: &s;o that if ever this Country be
made the Seat of a War, 'twill not be an ea&s;ie Task

the Soil, which is neither proper for <HI>Corn</HI> nor <HI>Pa&s;tu|rage,</HI>
it produces very good <HI>Wine,</HI> and great Store of

There is al&s;o a mix'd Sort of Wine, call'd <HI>Malm&s;ey,</HI>

<HI>Quails, Red-legg'd Partridges,</HI> and &s;ome <HI>Francolins,</HI>

Colour of Feathers; only the Wings of the latter

<HI>Ta&s;te.</HI> But all the&s;e Marks are not &s;ufficient to di&s;tin|gui&s;h
'em when they are dre&s;s'd, and therefore the
<HI>Cooks</HI> u&s;ually &s;tick one of the Feathers of the Wings
into the Body of a <HI>Francolin,</HI> that it may not be ta|ken

the Ground; and when they have gather'd &s;o many,
that the Weight of 'em may amount to five or &s;ix

<P><HI>MAr&s;eilles</HI> is one of the mo&s;t ancient Cities in
<HI>France;</HI> and tho it was famous in all Ages,
'tis not an ea&s;ie Task to trace its Original, not|with&s;tanding
the Opinion of &s;ome Writers, who
pretend that 'twas founded by the <HI>Greek</HI> Exiles,
who were driven out of their Country by <HI>Cyrus
the Great.</HI> 'Twas formerly the &s;eat of an Illu&s;tri|ous
A&s;&s;embly of learned Senators, and of an Ac|cademy,
which was the general Rendezvous of
Studious Per&s;ons from all the Corners of the World.
The&s;e glorious Advantages made it in a manner
the <HI>Metropolis of the Commonwealth of Learning;</HI> and
in&s;pir'd the <HI>Romans</HI> with &s;o high an E&s;teem for it,
that they courted the <HI>Friend&s;hip</HI> of the Citizens of
<HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> while the re&s;t of the Inhabitants of <HI>Pro|vence</HI>
were their <HI>Conquer'd Va&s;&s;als.</HI> After the Fall
of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, 'twas govern'd as a Re|publick
by four Counts; till at la&s;t the Inhabi|tants,
finding them&s;elves unable to with&s;tand the
united force of their Neighbours, put them&s;elves
under the Authority and Protection of the Kings
of <HI>France.</HI> But the Conditions of this Voluntary
Submi&s;&s;ion were very Honourable and Advantage|ous
<PB N="71" REF="52">
for 'twas concluded, that the City and its
Territory, which comprehends two Leagues round,
&s;hou'd be exempted from all manner of Taxes,
Charges, and Impo&s;itions; that the King &s;hou'd
not pretend a Right to any Cu&s;toms or Duties
for Goods Exported or Imported; That the City
&s;hou'd be govern'd by Four Con&s;uls, who &s;hou'd
hold their Office for Life, and be elected by the
Citizens; only 'twas agreed, That one Judge or
Magi&s;trate might be &s;ent by the King, with the
Title of <HI>Viguier:</HI> That they &s;hou'd not be oblig'd
to receive any Garri&s;on, or be commanded by a|ny
Cittadel but that of <HI>N&ocirc;tre-Dame de la Garde:</HI>
Be&s;ides &s;everal other Articles of the &s;ame Nature,
which remain'd in force till the King's Voyage
thither; when he took the occa&s;ion of a Mutiny that
was rais'd again&s;t the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e,</HI> General of
his Galleys, to aboli&s;h all the Privileges of <HI>Mar|&s;eilles.</HI>
You may imagine with what Con&s;terna|tion
and inward Rage they heard of their Sove|reign's
Approach in a Ho&s;tile manner, with an Ar|my
at his Heels; and afterwards beheld him enter
the Breach as into a conquer'd City: However
they &s;et a good Face on't, and re&s;olving to make
the be&s;t they cou'd of a de&s;perate Game, recei|ved
the De&s;troyer of their Liberty with all ima|ginable
Marks of Love and Re&s;pect. In the mean
time he order'd ten thou&s;and Men to march into
the City, who &s;eiz'd on the principal Po&s;ts, and
were lodg'd in the Citizen's Hou&s;es; and after|wards
told 'em, that he had ob&s;erv'd a great Number
of pretty Buildings in their Territory, and was
&s;o well pleas'd with 'em, that he was re&s;olv'd to
build one more. This De&s;ign was quickly put in
execution; for the Cittadel was erected at the
Mouth of the Port on the Right-&s;ide, and <HI>Fort
S. John</HI> on the other. The People of <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI>
perceiving that <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> was too feeble a Defence
<PB N="72" REF="53">
again&s;t <HI>Violence,</HI> very tamely &s;ubmitted to the new
Yoke that was impos'd upon 'em: And their
<HI>forc'd Complai&s;ance</HI> on this Occa&s;ion, was made
the Subject of a Song; of which the&s;e are two
Stanza's:
<Q><LG>
<L>He told'em he wou'd build a Fort,</L>
<L>And &s;wore 'twas meerly to protect 'em:</L>
<L>They &s;wore again they thank'd him for't,</L>
<L>Becau&s;e they dur&s;t not contradict him.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>They vow'd they were his loyal Slaves,</L>
<L>With Lives and Fortunes to a&s;&s;i&s;t him;</L>
<L>Ready to &s;erve him to their Graves,</L>
<L>Becau&s;e unable to re&s;i&s;t him.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>Whatever were the Sentiments of the&s;e unfor|tunate
People at that time, I can a&s;&s;ure you that
mo&s;t of the old Inhabitants are &s;truck with &s;o
much Horrour at the remembrance of that. Di&s;|a&s;ter,
that they never relate the Story of it with|out
the deepe&s;t Marks of a lively Sorrow. And
they &s;till retain &s;uch an inconceivable Abhorrence
again&s;t the <HI>French,</HI> that they &s;carce ever mention
'em but in the mo&s;t reproachful Terms that Spite
or Di&s;dain can invent. They look upon all tho&s;e
of that Nation to be contemptible Wretches; and
you cannot do 'em a more provoking Injury than
to call 'em <HI>Frenchmen.</HI> I cannot give you a more
lively Repre&s;entation of their implacable Hatred
again&s;t our Nation, than by relating a Story which
I heard t'other Day: When the King concluded
the la&s;t Peace with <HI>Algiers,</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners were
&s;ent on board all the Galleys, and into the Baths,
to relea&s;e all the <HI>French</HI> Slaves they cou'd find:
Some of the&s;e Officers perceiving a Man, whom
they took to be one of their own Nation, &s;tand|ing
in a carele&s;s manner, without &s;howing the
<PB N="73" REF="53">
lea&s;t de&s;ire to be Enroll'd in their Li&s;t, ask'd him,
<HI>Whether he was a Frenchman: No,</HI> an&s;wer'd he:
<HI>What Countryman art thou then?</HI> &s;aid one of the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners:
<HI>I'm a Native of Mar&s;eilles,</HI> reply'd the
Slave: <HI>Very well,</HI> &s;aid the Comm&s;&s;ioners; <HI>write to
thy King of Mar&s;eilles, that he may &s;et thee at liberty.</HI>
This is no contriv'd Story, but &s;o certain and
well-atte&s;ted a Truth, that I know &s;ome Per&s;ons
who were pre&s;ent when the Accident happen'd:
Nor will the crediblene&s;s of this Relation be que|&s;tion'd
by any who have had occa&s;ion to con|ver&s;e
with the Inhabitants of this City, or to be
Witne&s;&s;es of their extreme Aver&s;ion again&s;t our
Countrymen. If any of 'em gives his Daughter
in Marriage to a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> or makes a Man of
that Nation his particular Friend, he expo&s;es him|&s;elf
infallibly to the Hatred and Scorn of all his
Neighbours: And if a Maid &s;hou'd receive a Vi|&s;it
from a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> &s;he might for ever de&s;pair
of finding a Husband in her own Country. To
conclude; The People of <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> are in all re|&s;pects
diametrically oppo&s;ite to us; only I mu&s;t
except from this general Rule, the Nobility of this
City, and of the Country in which 'tis &s;eated,
than whom there are none of their Quality in
<HI>France</HI> that can lay a ju&s;ter Claim to Antiquity
of De&s;cent, and Politene&s;s of Manners; nor any
that are better affected to his Maje&s;ty's Ser|vice.</P>
<P>The Language of <HI>Provence</HI> is extremely har&s;h and
unplea&s;ant, e&s;pecially in <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> and the Terri|tory
that belongs to it, where the Pronunciation
is as Guttural as in <HI>Arabia.</HI> You can hardly ima|gine
what a va&s;t Alteration the very Sound or
Accent makes in a Language: There is &s;carce any
difference at all between the Words of the Dia|lects
that are us'd in <HI>Provence</HI> and <HI>Languedoc,</HI> and
neverthele&s;s this is as amorous and agreeable as
<PB N="74" REF="54">
that is rough and uncouth. A Stranger is never
more &s;en&s;ible of the Truth of this Ob&s;ervation,
than at his fir&s;t Arrival: And I remember that
the very Day on which I came to this City, I
was a&s;toni&s;h'd at the intolerable Clowni&s;hne&s;s
with which a hand&s;ome young Lady pronounc'd
the&s;e Words, to di&s;wade one of her Kin&s;men from
quarrelling with an ordinary Woman: <HI>Hai, mon
Cou&s;in,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>lach&eacute; &s;tata quelle femme, non &s;abais
pas qua cau &agrave; la te&s;te dau Diable.</HI> This made me
tell a Gentleman, who, &s;ome Days after, ask'd my
Opinion of the Women of <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> That <HI>I ad|mir'd
their Beauty, but cou'd wi&s;h they were dumb,
becau&s;e their Speech was &s;uch a Bugbear, that all the
Charms of their Countenance cou'd never retain a</HI> French
<HI>Lover. If you were acquainted with their Humour,</HI>
reply'd he, <HI>you wou'd be ea&s;ily convinc'd, that the very
Rea&s;on you alledge wou'd make 'em in love with their
Pronounciation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> is one of the mo&s;t populous Cities in
<HI>France;</HI> but the third part of tho&s;e who re&s;ide in
it are Strangers. The old part of the Town is
neither very large nor fair: The Streets are nar|row,
crooked, and uneven, by rea&s;on of its Situ|ation
on a Hillock; but 'tis at lea&s;t double of
what it was thirty Years ago. The <HI>Cours,</HI> or Pub|lick
Place for taking the Air, is exactly in the
middle of a long and very &s;treight Street, that
reaches from the Gate of <HI>Aix</HI> to that of <HI>Rome,</HI>
and &s;eparates the Old from the New Town. 'Tis
1000 Paces long, (which is only the third part
of the length of the Street) and in all other re|&s;pects
is like to that of <HI>Aix.</HI> Four Men are hir'd
by the City, to Water it twice a Day in Summer,
that the Du&s;t may not offend the Gentlemen and
Citizens, who flock thither every Evening in &s;uch
Multitudes, that a Man can hardly turn him&s;elf
in the Croud. The Hou&s;es that Border it are
<PB N="75" REF="54">
built pretty regularly, but are not &s;o fine as at
<HI>Aix.</HI></P>
<P>The New City is well built; the Streets are
broad, &s;treight, and light; and be&s;ides, 'tis con|&s;iderable
for the Quality of its Inhabitants; for
all the Officers of the Galleys, the Gentry,
and the richer part of the Citizens chu&s;e to live
in it. The Extent of the Walls of the City has
been con&s;iderably augmented within the&s;e three
Years; for be&s;ides what they contain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d before,
there is a large Space enclos'd behind the Ar&s;enal
for a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">lace of Arms,</HI> which (when fini&s;h'd) will be
300 Paces &s;quare. The King be&s;tows the Ground
about this Place on tho&s;e who will build Hou&s;es
on it, provided they ob&s;erve the Lines mark'd
out for that purpo&s;e. By means of this new Ad|dition,
the Abbey of S. <HI>Victor</HI> is advanc'd further
within the Town, being a Mona&s;tery of unre|form'd
<HI>Benedictines,</HI> who acknowledge no other
Superiour but the Pope, in Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Ca&s;es.
There are 50000 Livres a Year annex'd to this
Hou&s;e, for the Maintenance of eighteen or twen|ty
Monks, who know very well how to enjoy
all the comforts of &s;o plentiful a Revenue. The
Neighbourhood of the&s;e Independent Gentlemen
is &s;o great an Eye-&s;ore to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI>
that he has &s;everal times endeavour'd to make 'em
con&s;ent to the Re-union of their Mona&s;tery with
the Chapter of the Cathedral, offering 'em all
the Privileges of the Canons, with the Coadju|tor&s;hip
of the Bi&s;hoprick for their Prior: But
they have hitherto kept them&s;elves from being
dazzl'd with the &s;eeming Advantageou&s;ne&s;s of the&s;e
Propo&s;als. The pre&s;ent Bi&s;hop is of the Family of
<HI>Vintimille,</HI> de&s;cended from the Counts of <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI>
and Nephew of Cardinal <HI>Fourbain Jan&s;on,</HI> his Prede|ce&s;&s;or
in the Bi&s;hoprick. He is well-&s;hap'd, hand|&s;ome,
not above thirty Years old, has very much
<PB N="76" REF="55">
the Air of the Court, and might be reckon'd a
very hand&s;ome Man, if his Teeth were &s;ome|what
&s;maller, and more evenly &s;et. He is a Man
of Sence and good Breeding, of a plea&s;ant Wit
and agreeable Conver&s;ation. He is none of tho&s;e
moro&s;e Cen&s;urers, who affect a certain Surline&s;s
and ill Humour on all Occa&s;ions. His Life is a
convincing Argument that the Plea&s;ures of this
World are not altogether incon&s;i&s;tent with Devo|tion.
He plays, hears Opera's, vi&s;its Ladies, and
if we may believe the common Report, is not
hated by 'em: Yet all the&s;e mu&s;t be acknow|ledg'd
to be innocent Liberties, &s;ince he always
pre&s;erves a due regard to the Laws of Decency,
and never &s;eems to be guilty of any Criminal
De&s;ign. I know a Per&s;on who took the liberey
to de&s;ire the u&s;e of his Purple Habit and
Golden Cro&s;s, for a Ma&s;que: The Prelate reply'd,
That the&s;e Accoutrements were Sacred; but very
civilly accommodated him with his Ca&s;&s;ock, &s;hort
Cloak, and Perriwig. He has a Niece who is
admitted into the Nunnery of S. <HI>Ur&s;ula,</HI> at <HI>Mar|&s;eilles,</HI>
and is certainly the mo&s;t amiable Girl in
the World: His Affection to her is &s;uitable to
her Merit; and &s;ince &s;he is yet too young to bear
the Au&s;terities of a Religious Life, he &s;uffers her
to live with her Father, the Marque&s;s <HI>de Fourbain:</HI>
In the mean time he vi&s;its her daily, and in&s;tructs
her in all the Duties of her Profe&s;&s;ion. Let us
leave 'em in this Holy Occupation, and take a
View of the <HI>Port</HI> of <HI>Mar&s;eilles.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis inclos'd within the City, which &s;ecures it
on all &s;ides from the Violence of the Winds;
and its Mouth that before was not above thirty
Paces broad, is &s;treighten'd by two Moles, lea|ving
a very narrow Pa&s;&s;age for the Galleys,
which is &s;hut up with a Chain every Night,
and open'd at Seven in the Morning. The Har|bour
<PB N="77" REF="55">
by the large&s;t Computation is not above
twelve hundred Paces long, and three hundred
broad; and be&s;ides, 'tis &s;o &s;hallow that a Man of
War cannot enter into it. However 'tis the Sta|tion
of all the King's Galleys, of which there
are forty five, including the old <HI>Patronne,</HI> which
at pre&s;ent &s;erves only for a Show, and for an
In&s;tance of the late prodigious Increa&s;e of the
<HI>French</HI> Grandeur. All the re&s;t of the Galleys are
magnificently Painted and Gilt, e&s;pecially the new
<HI>Patronne,</HI> which is adorn'd with the fine&s;t <HI>Ba&s;&s;o-Relievo's</HI>
that are made in this Age: Be&s;ides the
Flags, Banners, Streamers, and Pendants, which
are all incredibly Rich. All the&s;e Ornaments are of
the be&s;t and fine&s;t red Dama<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">k, with <HI>Flower-de-Lu|ces,</HI>
Devices, and Coats of Arms embroider'd with
Gold: The principal Flag is above forty Foot
long, and ten broad; and all the re&s;t are propor|tionably
large: The <HI>Poop,</HI> where the General has
his Chamber, is cover'd with the &s;ame Stuff, en|rich'd
with a Fringe of Gold and Silk.</P>
<P>All the other Galleys are adorn'd after the &s;ame
manner, only in&s;tead of Gold they have Yel|lowi&s;h
Silk, which is no le&s;s agreeable to the Sight,
e&s;pecially at a Di&s;tance. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible to be|hold
a more &s;tately Pro&s;pect than tho&s;e Galleys
when they appear in all their Magnificence on
Sundays and Holydays. But notwith&s;tanding all
the&s;e external Beauties, they are only &s;plendid
Pri&s;ons to the mo&s;t mi&s;erable Wretches in the
World; the poor Slaves are chain'd together, ea|ten
up with Vermin and Scabs, beaten from Morn|ing
to Night, and expos'd to all the Injuries of
Cold. Their only Habit is a &s;ort of wide and
&s;hort Jacket, without Shooes or Stockings, without
a Shirt for Change, without Straw to lie upon,
without any other Food than a little Bread as black
as Soot; and to crown their Mi&s;ery, without the
<PB N="78" REF="56">
lea&s;t hope of a Deliverance from this deplorable
Captivity, more in&s;upportable than that of the
<HI>Turks.</HI> There comes not a Per&s;on of Quality
to <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> whom the Intendant does not regale
with this &s;ight on board the new <HI>Patronne,</HI> which
on the&s;e Occa&s;ions is embelli&s;h'd with all its Or|naments.
The Galley-Slaves perform their Exer|ci&s;e
by the Sound of a Fi&s;quet: Fir&s;t they &s;alute
the Intendant and tho&s;e that are with him, bel|lowing
out thrice <HI>Hou, hou, hou,</HI> as if they were
Bears in a Humane Form: In the next place they
&s;tretch a Rope from one &s;ide of the Galley to
the other, and then a Sail-Yard; this done, they
&s;et up the Tent and take it down again; after which
comes the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary part of their Exerci&s;e,
they pull off their Jackets and Shirts, &s;haking off
the Lice into the Sea, and &s;weeping 'em away
with their Hands: Then they put on their Clothes,
and the Haut-boys entertain their Company; who
at their Departure receive the &s;ame howling Sa|lutation
as at fir&s;t. I know not what Plea&s;ure
&s;ome Per&s;ons may take in beholding &s;o di&s;mal a
Spectacle, but I a&s;&s;ure you it had a quite con|trary
Effect upon me: I was altogether unable to
re&s;i&s;t the Motions of a mo&s;t tender Compa&s;&s;ion,
mixt with Horrour; and I'm per&s;uaded you cou'd
not pre&s;erve the u&s;ual Tranquillity of your Mind
at the reading of a lively Recital of the Reflexi|ons
I made on this Occa&s;ion: I &s;hall therefore
leave this melancholy Subject, and proceed to en|tertain
you with &s;omething more diverting.</P>
<P>The&s;e Galleys are Mann'd with a Regiment,
compos'd of as many Companies as there are Ve&s;|&s;els,
each Company con&s;i&s;ting of one hundred and
twenty Men, who exceed all the Soldiers in the
King's Service, in Comeline&s;s of Per&s;on, and Large|ne&s;s
of Stature; for the Captains never grudge to
advance Ten <HI>Louis d' Or's</HI> when they meet with a
<PB N="79" REF="56">
Man that plea&s;es 'em: And be&s;ides, there are two
con&s;iderable Encouragements that invite Men to
enter into this Service; for they have a <HI>Sous</HI> a
Day more than in the Land-Army; and the
Campaign, or time of Action, never la&s;ts above
two Months. There is al&s;o a di&s;tinct Company,
call'd the <HI>Guards of the Standard,</HI> who are cloath'd in
Red, with a Gold Galoon, and train'd up to be
En&s;igns of the Galleys: This Company con&s;i&s;ted
formerly of fifty Men, but their Number was doubl'd
this Winter, and 'twas order'd that no Per&s;on
henceforth &s;hou'd be admitted into it, without a
<HI>Brevet.</HI></P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Maine</HI> is at pre&s;ent General of the
Galleys; but &s;ince that Office is purely Honorary,
all the Duties of it are executed by the Lieutenant-General,
the <HI>Chevalier de Noailles,</HI> Brother to the
Duke of that Name. This Officer is much envy'd,
if not hated, by &s;ome old Commanders of Squa|drons,
who grumbl'd extremely to &s;ee him advanc'd
before 'em; yet &s;ince he is a very brave Man, and
po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of his Ma&s;ter's Favour, his Court is al|ways
pretty numerous. Some days ago he vi&s;ited
the <HI>Ar&s;enal,</HI> and I took hold of that Occa&s;ion to &s;a|tisfie
my Curio&s;ity, which I cou'd hardly have done
at another time; for Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Montmor,</HI> the In|tendant,
keeps the Keys of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable
Places, and never parts with 'em out of his Cu&s;tody,
but when there is &s;omething to be done that requires
the opening of the Doors. Tho' this <HI>Ar&s;enal</HI> was
not begun to be built till about Thirty Years ago,
it may be divided into the <HI>Old</HI> and the <HI>New;</HI> &s;ince
the Additions that have been made within the&s;e four
Years, make it at lea&s;t double of what it was before.
The Length of the <HI>Old Ar&s;enal</HI> is equal to the
Breadth of the Port which it fronts; It contains
particular Magazines for all the Galleys, mark'd
with their re&s;pective Names, with large Round
<PB N="80" REF="57">
Doors. This is the Lower Story on one Side; the
other contains Magazines of Cannon, Bombs, Car|ca&s;&s;es,
and Gun-Powder, in which 'tis &s;aid there
are Two thou&s;and Pieces of Cannon, and Five hun|dred
Bombs. The Upper Story is divided into
Rooms, where the Flags, Pendants, Sails, and the
re&s;t of the Tackling are kept; but mo&s;t of 'em are
empty. Here is al&s;o a fair Hall of Arms, the Walls
of which are hung with Six thou&s;and Mu&s;quets,
and as many Sabres, all kept in very good Order:
And near this is another, where there are Five hun|dred
Sutes of Armour, all intire and bright as Silver.
The whole <HI>Ar&s;enal</HI> is one &s;ingle Ma&s;s of Building, in
the Middle of which there is a Dome with a Clock:
and tho' in the general it may be reckon'd a fine
Building, there is nothing in it that de&s;erves to be
admir'd. The <HI>New Ar&s;enal</HI> begins where the other
ends, and &s;tretches along the Port almo&s;t to the Cit|tadel:
'Tis larger than the <HI>Old Ar&s;enal,</HI> tho' not &s;o well
built, but when 'tis fini&s;h'd 'twill exceed the other, not
only in Va&s;tne&s;s of Extent, but in the Beauty and Con|veniency
of a fine Canal, thro' which the Galleys
may come to the Doors of their re&s;pective Maga|zines.
'Tis al&s;o &s;aid that there will be Stoves built
there for the Galley-Slaves, to le&s;&s;en the Mi&s;eries
they u&s;ually &s;uffer in the Winter. This is the Place
where the Galleys are built, in a certain dry Ditch
or Dock, into which they can let as much Water
as they plea&s;e, by a Sluce; &s;o that the Galley is im|mediately
&s;et a-float, without the lea&s;t Trouble in
Lanching it. The Place of Arms, of which I took
notice before, will be behind the <HI>Ar&s;enal.</HI></P>
<P>There is not one fine Church in <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> but
there are &s;ome very ancient. That of <HI>N&ocirc;tre-Dame
des Accoules</HI> was formerly con&s;ecrated to <HI>Pallas,</HI> that
of <HI>S. Saviour</HI> to <HI>Apollo,</HI> and the Cathedral or Church
<HI>de la Major,</HI> is &s;aid to have been a Temple of <HI>Di|ana.</HI>
In the la&s;t the Body of S. <HI>Lazarus,</HI> the fir&s;t
<PB N="81" REF="57">
Bi&s;hop of this City, is kept in a Silver Shrine; and
there are &s;everal other Holy Rarities both in this
and S. <HI>Victor's</HI> Church; where, be&s;ides the Head of
that Saint, they pre&s;erve the True Cro&s;s of S. <HI>An|drew,</HI>
which is &s;even Foot long, and con&s;i&s;ts of two
Joi&s;ts join'd cro&s;s-ways, after the Figure of an X.
Here is al&s;o a <HI>Grotto,</HI> where <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> did Pe|nance
for &s;ome time. The whole City is full of
&s;uch Places, but none of 'em is &s;o much re&s;pected
as S. <HI>Baume,</HI> where 'tis &s;aid &s;he liv'd 33 Years. Not|with&s;tanding
all the Difficulties and di&s;couraging
Rubbs I met with in my Pa&s;&s;age thro' the Moun|tains,
my Curio&s;ity was &s;till &s;trong enough to ob|lige
me to undertake a Pilgrimage to that Place;
and in my next you may expect an Account of the
Ob&s;ervations I made there.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>S. <HI>Baume</HI> is a Cave in the mid&s;t of a Rock, which
is &s;o extremely high and &s;teep, that by taking a
di&s;tant View of this Place, you wou'd think it im|po&s;&s;ible
to a&s;cend to it. And certainly the A&s;cent
was very difficult at fir&s;t, &s;ince at pre&s;ent, tho' there
are Steps very indu&s;triou&s;ly cut out of the Rock, it
requires a Man's whole Skill and Agility to mount
the&s;e artificial Stairs, holding his Hor&s;e by the Bri|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">le;
and the Plea&s;ure of arriving at the Top of 'em
<PB N="82" REF="58">
is very con&s;iderably increas'd by the need one has of
Re&s;t. This Rock is the Top of the highe&s;t Moun|tain
of <HI>Provence,</HI> between <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> and <HI>Toulon;</HI>
and you mu&s;t a&s;cend continually for the &s;pace of
two Hours, before you can arrive at the Rock:
The Cave is po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by certain <HI>Jacobin</HI> Friars,
&s;ent thither by the Prior of S. <HI>Maximin,</HI> who al|lows
each of 'em a Thou&s;and Livres a Year for
their Maintenance, without reckoning their Ma&s;&s;es:
And I'm confident they cannot &s;pare much out
of &s;o con&s;iderable a Revenue, &s;ince they are ob|lig'd
to be at a va&s;t and almo&s;t daily Charge for
the Carriage of &s;uch things as are nece&s;&s;ary for
their Sub&s;i&s;tence, the Situation of the Place not
permitting 'em to lay up great &s;tore of Provi&s;i|ons.
On the right &s;ide of the Entrance into the
Cave, they have taken Advantage of a piece of
the Rock that jutts out beyond the re&s;t of it, to
contrive a little Convent, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;eventeen
Cells, and three double Chambers, which are ap|pointed
for the King, the Bi&s;hop, and the Go|vernour
of the Province, or at lea&s;t are call'd by
their Names. On the other &s;ide of the Entry
there is an Inn, where we paid dear for
what we eat, be&s;ides the Chaplets and Medals
with which my Companions loaded them&s;elves.
'Tis Morally impo&s;&s;ible that ever any Per&s;on
cou'd have liv'd in this Cave as many Days as <HI>Mary
Magdalen,</HI> according to the Tradition, liv'd Years
in it, by rea&s;on of the extreme Coldne&s;s and
Moi&s;tne&s;s of the place, occa&s;ion'd by the conti|nual
dropping of Water from the impending Rock,
which falls in &s;uch abundance, that it fills a kind
of Well or Ci&s;tern below. The Monks pretend
that this perpetual dropping is a miraculous Em|blem
of the Tears which that Saint &s;hed in
this place; and that 'tis naturally impo&s;&s;ible for
Water to &s;pring out of &s;o high a Rock. This is
<PB N="83" REF="58">
a Philo&s;ophical Que&s;tion, which you may deter|mine
at your lei&s;ure; for I'm re&s;olv'd to &s;ay
nothing on this Subject that may prepo&s;&s;e&s;s your
Judgment.</P>
<P>In the bottom of the Cave there is a little
Rock, about three Foot high, which I vehement|ly
&s;u&s;pect to be Artificial; for 'tis exactly con|triv'd
like a Bed, with the re&s;emblance of a Bol|&s;ter,
as if it had been made on purpo&s;e for that
u&s;e. 'Tis inclos'd with a great Iron Grate, which
the Monks open, that the Spectators may have a
full View of the Saint's Image of Marble, paint|ed
and gilt: She is laid at her full length, her
Head leaning on her Right-hand, and in her o|ther
holding the <HI>Pix,</HI> in which &s;he kept con&s;ecra|ted
Wafers or Ho&s;ts. This Image is much bigger
than the Life, being &s;even Foot long; and yet
they pretend that 'tis an exact imitation both of her
Face and Stature. 'Tis &s;trange that the Scripture
&s;hou'd neither mention her unu&s;ual Bigne&s;s, her
Quality, (for they &s;ay &s;he was a Prince&s;s) nor
her Voyage: And 'tis &s;till more &s;urprizing, that a
Woman of her Stature cou'd charm &s;uch a Croud
of Lovers: I know not whether the Men of her
Age had a particular Inclination to Court <HI>Gian|te&s;&s;es;</HI>
but I que&s;tion very much whether &s;uch a
<HI>Bouncing Girl</HI> wou'd find &s;o many Admirers a|mong
us.</P>
<P>After a Traveller has &s;atisfy'd his Curio&s;ity with
a View of all the&s;e Rarities, it is the u&s;ual Cu|&s;tom
to go up to the Top of the Rock, call'd
S. <HI>Pilon,</HI> whither that Saint was carried &s;even times
a Day by the Angels, that &s;he might have the
Convenience of &s;aying her Prayers at that Place.
I will not detain you with the particular Rela|tion
of the re&s;t of her Adventures: But &s;ince, per|haps,
you may not be unwilling to know how,
and by what odd Accident &s;he came to this Place,
<PB N="84" REF="59">
I &s;hall give you a &s;hort Account of that part of
her Hi&s;tory. After our Saviour's A&s;cen&s;ion, there
aro&s;e a violent Per&s;ecution again&s;t his Di&s;ciples,
as you may &s;ee at length in the <HI>Acts of the Apo|&s;tles:</HI>
Among the re&s;t, the Family of S. <HI>Lazarus</HI>
was involv'd in the common Calamity; but the
<HI>Jews,</HI> unwilling to make Per&s;ons of Quality &s;uf|fer
the utmo&s;t Severities that were u&s;ually inflict|ed
on others, in&s;tead of putting 'em to Death,
plac'd <HI>Lazarus</HI> and his Si&s;ter, S. <HI>Maximin,</HI> and &s;ome
others, who&s;e Names I do not remember, in a
Bark, without Oars, Rudder, or Sails, abandoning
'em to the Mercy of the Winds, which by the
Providence of God, brought 'em into the Port of
<HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> where they &s;pent &s;everal Years in Preach|ing
the Go&s;pel: Their Memory is pre&s;erv'd to
this Day, by a great number of Chapels erected
in the places where 'tis pretended the <HI>He</HI> and <HI>She</HI>
Saints u&s;ually pronounc'd their Sermons; which
had &s;uch a prevailing Influence on their Hearers,
that the whole City was converted. After &s;uch
happy Succe&s;s, S. <HI>Lazarus</HI> was made Bi&s;hop, and
<HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> went to do Penance in the horrid
Cave of S. <HI>Baume.</HI> Her Head, and one of her
Arms are kept at S. <HI>Maximin,</HI> among&s;t a great num|ber
of fine Relicks: Her Head is enchas'd in a
kind of Bu&s;t of Gold, ending a little below her
Shoulders, and enrich'd with a great number of
very fine Jewels, among which there is an admi|rable
Ruby, equalling a Man's Thumb both in
Length and Breadth: This Bu&s;t was pre&s;ented by
<HI>Charles</HI> II. King of <HI>Switzerland,</HI> Count of <HI>Pro|vence.</HI>
The whole Face of this Head is expos'd
to view, contrary to the Cu&s;tom of other Places,
where the Shrine is only &s;how'd, and the Specta|tor
mu&s;t imploy his Faith, if it be &s;trong enough,
to di&s;cover the Relicks: But here one may di|&s;tinctly
perceive a Death's-Head of &s;o va&s;t a &s;ize,
<PB N="85" REF="59">
that if it be <HI>Mary Magdalen's,</HI> we cannot ju&s;tly
refu&s;e our A&s;&s;ent to the Tradition, that a&s;&s;ures
us of the unu&s;ual Bulkine&s;s of the re&s;t of her Bo|dy.
Our Guide made us ob&s;erve a little dry
Scurf about the middle of her Forehead, &s;ome|what
towards her Left Eye, and told us, that
this was the place where our Saviour put his Fin|ger,
when, after his Re&s;urrection,
he &s;aid to her,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">John 20. 17.</NOTE> <HI>Touch me not,</HI> &amp;c. But
&s;ince I had never ob&s;erv'd in the
Scripture, that Chri&s;t put his Finger on her Fore|head,
when he &s;pake the&s;e Words, I ask'd a Fa|ther
where I might find that Pa&s;&s;age: He told
me that it was a Holy Tradition of the Church,
which I was oblig'd to believe, under pain of
Here&s;ie; adding, upon the Authority of the &s;ame
Tradition, That during the Forty Days which
Chri&s;t &s;pent with his Di&s;ciples after
his Re&s;urrection<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">This is a di|rect Contradi|ction to the la&s;t Chapter of S. <HI>Matthew's</HI> Go|&s;pel, where 'tis &s;aid of the two <HI>Maries,</HI> that as they were going from the Sepulchre, Je&s;us met 'em, and that they came and <HI>held him by the Feet,</HI> and wor&s;hipped him.</NOTE>, he never touch'd
any thing but this part of <HI>Mary Mag|dalen's</HI>
Forehead, and S. <HI>Thomas's</HI> Hand,
both which remain entire to this Day.</P>
<P>This Head is pre&s;erv'd in a Subterraneous Cave,
clos'd with four Iron Doors; and we were told,
that the Bodies of S. <HI>Magdalen,</HI> S. <HI>Maximin,</HI> S. <HI>Mar|cellus,</HI>
and S. <HI>Sidonius,</HI> were put into four Marble
Sepulchres, that are &s;till to be &s;een in this Cave,
which was contriv'd on purpo&s;e for their Bury|ing-place;
but that the&s;e Holy Bodies were after|wards
more honourably lodg'd. In the &s;ame Cave,
or Subterraneous Chapel, they &s;hew al&s;o a little
Gla&s;s Vial, containing certain &s;mall Flints that were
moi&s;tened with the Blood that our Saviour &s;hed
upon the Cro&s;s; endeavouring to make the Spe|ctatours
<PB N="86" REF="60">
believe that the Blood is &s;till vi&s;ible; but
whatever care I took to con&s;ider the&s;e Flints with
all imaginable Attention, I cou'd not perceive the
lea&s;t Tincture of Blood. Coming up from hence,
we were de&s;ir'd to take Notice of a Shrine of
Porphyrie, which contains the re&s;t of that Saint's
Bones, except one of her Arms, which is enchas'd
in Silver, and &s;uitable in bigne&s;s to the Head: Her
Flaxen Hair is in another Reliquary: And there are
in the &s;ame place many other Rarities of this Na|ture,
which 'twou'd be too tedious to enume|rate.</P>
<P>The Church that belongs to this Convent, is
large, well lighted, and very much e&s;teem'd for
its Architecture. The In&s;ide is adorn'd with &s;e|veral
fine Marble Columns, e&s;pecially the great
Altar, which was built by <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. in perfor|mance
of a Vow; and is reckon'd one of the
large&s;t, and mo&s;t magnificent Altars in <HI>France.</HI>
All the re&s;t of the Church is cover'd with
Paintings, by the mo&s;t celebrated Hands, which
are al&s;o the Effects of Vows: And every Altar is
enrich'd with all &s;orts of Ve&s;&s;els, Candle&s;ticks,
Lamps, and other Ornaments of Gold and Silver,
in great abundance. This Church was built by
<HI>Charles,</HI> Duke of <HI>Anjou,</HI> King of <HI>Sicily,</HI> who en|dow'd
it with a very plentiful Revenue; and the
Foundation being &s;ince encreas'd by the Piety of
our Kings, there is a very honourable Maintenance
for Fifty Monks who live here.</P>
<P>I'm afraid the Holine&s;s of the Place will &s;carce
make amends for my detaining you &s;o long at
S. <HI>Baume;</HI> and therefore &s;ince a change of Enter|tainment
is always very acceptable to a cloy'd Ap|petite,
I hope you will have the le&s;s Reluctancy
to accompany me in a little Journey to <HI>Arles</HI>
and <HI>Ni&s;mes,</HI> where you might divert your &s;elf
with a View of tho&s;e Admirable Antiquities, and
<PB N="87" REF="60">
Illu&s;trious Monuments of the <HI>Roman</HI> Grandeur that
are to be &s;een in tho&s;e places.</P>
<P><HI>Arles</HI> is a City of <HI>Provence,</HI> and was formerly
the Metropolis of a Kingdom of the &s;ame Name.
'Twas adorn'd by its old Ma&s;ters, the <HI>Romans,</HI>
with Temples, Palaces, Amphitheatres, and other
magnificent Works, mo&s;t of which were ruin'd in
the &s;ucceeding Revolutions. The Amphitheatre,
commonly call'd <HI>les Arrenes,</HI> has e&s;cap'd the Fate of
the re&s;t, tho' not &s;o well as that of <HI>N&icirc;mes;</HI> for
'tis impo&s;&s;ible to walk on the Top from one end
to the other; &s;o that I cou'd not mea&s;ure its
Length and Breadth.</P>
<P>The <HI>Town-Hou&s;e</HI> is very remarkable, both for its
Structure and Antiquities: Among the re&s;t there
is a Marble Statue of <HI>Diana,</HI> which former|ly
pronounc'd Oracles to tho&s;e who came to
con&s;ult her in her Temple, which was &s;eated in
the &s;ame place where the <HI>Town-Hou&s;e</HI> &s;tands at pre|&s;ent,
as appears by the Foundations that are un|der
the Clock-Tower. All the Walls of the City
are full of pieces of Statues, Cornices, and Co|lumns,
which give the Spectatour a great <HI>Idea</HI> of
the Number and Beauty of its Ancient Orna|ments.
Among its fine&s;t Antiquities, I may ju&s;t|ly
reckon that admirable Obelisk which &s;ome
Years ago was found entire in the Ground,
and was &s;ince erected to the Glory of <HI>Lewis the
Great,</HI> by the Care and Contrivance of the Gen|tlemen
of the <HI>Royal Academy,</HI> with very beautiful
In&s;criptions on the Pede&s;tal, both in <HI>Latine</HI> and
<HI>French;</HI> and a <HI>Golden Sun</HI> on the Top, which you
know is the King's Emblem, and the Soul of his
Device. This Obelisk wants the u&s;ual Ornament
of Monuments of that Nature, and, at lea&s;t in
this re&s;pect may be ju&s;tly e&s;teem'd a Rarity. But tho'
there are no Hieroglyphical Figures upon it, to
determine its Age, and di&s;cover its fir&s;t Contri|vers,
<PB N="88" REF="61">
'tis generally reputed a Work of the <HI>Egyp|tians.</HI>
I know not whether the &s;ame Opinion
will prevail in After-Ages; for perhaps Po&s;terity
viewing the In&s;criptions that have been lately ad|ded
to it, will do our Age the Honour to be|lieve
that 'twas capable of Undertaking and Fi|ni&s;hing
&s;uch Works; if they be not kept from
falling into that Errour, by the Con&s;ideration of
the <HI>Granite</HI> of which 'tis built.</P>
<P>This City is the Seat of an Archbi&s;hop, and
of an Academy of Ingenious Per&s;ons, under the
Name of the <HI>Royal Academy of Arles;</HI> to whom
the Publick mu&s;t own it &s;elf oblig'd for many
Curious and Learned Treati&s;es. 'Tis &s;ituated on
the <HI>Rh&ocirc;ne,</HI> at the di&s;tance of &s;even Leagues from
its Mouth: But no Ship, nor great Bark, can
come up to the City, by rea&s;on of the Banks
of Sand with which that River is pe&s;ter'd.</P>
<P>Having &s;atisfy'd my Curio&s;ity at <HI>Arles,</HI> I re|&s;olv'd
to vi&s;it <HI>Ni&s;mes,</HI> one of the mo&s;t remarkable
Cities in <HI>Languedoc,</HI> for its Trade, Antiquity, and
I may al&s;o add, for its Largene&s;s, tho' 'tis at pre|&s;ent
much le&s;s con&s;iderable in that re&s;pect than
when (if we may give credit to Hi&s;tory) 'twas
founded by <HI>Marius,</HI> who cho&s;e this for the place
of his Re&s;idence, and built it in imitation of <HI>Rome,</HI>
ob&s;erving an exact Equality in the Dimen&s;ions of
the New City, as well as in its Publick Places
and Buildings. But Time, that impartial De&s;troy|er
of all things, has made &s;o many Alterations
in both the&s;e Illu&s;trious Cities, that at pre&s;ent
there is not the lea&s;t Re&s;emblance between 'em.</P>
<P>The principal Monument of Antiquity at <HI>Ni&s;|mes,</HI>
is its Amphitheatre, the large&s;t and mo&s;t en|tire
Structure of that Nature that is at pre&s;ent to
be &s;een in any part of the World. I cannot
forbear complaining that Private Per&s;ons are &s;uf|fer'd
to fill it with Hou&s;es, which quite take away
<PB N="89" REF="61">
the Pro&s;pect of it, and con&s;equently all its Beau|ty;
whereas if it were &s;till empty, as when 'twas
po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by the <HI>Romans,</HI> all the Curious part of
the World wou'd come to admire the Magnifi|cence
of its Structure. 'Tis of a perfectly round
or circular Figure, having only one Door, with
a Tower on each &s;ide of it: It contains 150 Pa|ces
in Diameter, and its Circumference amounts
to 460. The In&s;ide of the Circle is Pyramidal,
in form of Stairs, where the People &s;ate to behold
the Fights of Bea&s;ts, and other Publick Sights;
and below there are very fair vaulted Galleries,
where the Spectatours might walk till the Shows
began. This lower Story is adorn'd with fine Co|lumns,
with their Cornices; and from place to place
there are Heads of Animals, Eagles and Fa&s;ces in
<HI>Relief.</HI> The whole Amphitheatre is built of large
Free-Stones, &s;ome of which are three Foot &s;quare
on all &s;ides; and particularly tho&s;e on the Top
of the Building.</P>
<P>We went out at the Gate <HI>la Bouquerie,</HI> to &s;ee
the famous Temple of <HI>Diana,</HI> where that Godde&s;s
pronounc'd her Oracles. 'Tis an exact Square,
the length of each &s;ide amounting to Seventy Pa|ces:
The Door is round, ten Foot broad, and
fifteen high. This is a very Ma&s;&s;ive Edifice, ac|cording
to the ancient manner of Building, and
con&s;i&s;ts of Stones as large as tho&s;e of the Amphi|theatre;
&s;o that it might &s;erve for a Fort in Ca&s;e
of Nece&s;&s;ity, and even might hold out for &s;ome
time again&s;t Cannon.</P>
<P>Not far from thence there is another no le&s;s
remarkable Structure, call'd, <HI>la Tour Magne,</HI> which
we may rea&s;onably conclude to have been
de&s;ign'd for a <HI>Mau&s;olaeum,</HI> and built in imitation,
tho' not after the Model, of the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Monu|ments.
'Tis a high and &s;olid Pyramidal Tower,
without any Vault or Concavity; and there are
<PB N="90" REF="62">
Steps made round it, by which one may a&s;cend
to the Top, tho' not without Danger; for they
are extremely worn and broken in &s;everal places;
&s;o that I cho&s;e rather to content my &s;elf with
viewing it from below, than to run the hazard
of going up. From thence I return'd to the
City, and went to &s;ee an old Palace, call'd, <HI>The
Square Hou&s;e,</HI> which at pre&s;ent is the Dwelling-Hou&s;e
of a Private Per&s;on. 'Tis much longer than
broad, built with great Free-Stones, and adorn'd
on the Out&s;ide with &s;everal fine Columns, with
their Ba&s;es and Cornices. Some think this Hou&s;e
was formerly the <HI>Praetorium,</HI> or Hall of Judgment;
but others are of opinion that 'twas the <HI>Capitol</HI>
of <HI>Ni&s;mes.</HI></P>
<P>This City is full of People of Quality and Breed|ing;
and tho' there is &s;o &s;mall a di&s;tance between it
and <HI>Provence,</HI> I can a&s;&s;ure you, that their Cu&s;toms
are not only different but oppo&s;ite; and in&s;tead of
that Scorn and Contempt with which <HI>Frenchmen</HI> are
treated at <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> here they are entertain'd with
all imaginable Civility, and with the highe&s;t Marks of
Love and Friend&s;hip. You wou'd hardly give Cre|dit
to &s;ome In&s;tances of this Nature which I cou'd
relate to you: The Ladies take plea&s;ure to acco&s;t
a Stranger whom they find walking alone; Their
Conver&s;ation is accompany'd with all the Sprightli|ne&s;s
and innocent Freedom that can be de&s;ir'd. For
tho' they have as tender a Regard to their Honour
as any of their Sex in <HI>France;</HI> their Vertue is not
barbarous and inhumane; and provided a Man have
an Inclination to Love, and be Ma&s;ter of a compe|tent
Stock of Merit, join'd with &s;ome external Ac|compli&s;hments,
he may venture to ingage with tho&s;e
favourable Enemies with almo&s;t certain Hopes of
Succe&s;s. I have heard a hundred Relations of &s;uch
amorous Adventures of Strangers, who taking Fire
at fir&s;t &s;ight, were afterwards ble&s;s'd with the Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
<PB N="91" REF="62">
of the Object of their Flames; and pre&s;er|ving
their Love after Marriage, had never any Rea|&s;on
to repent of the Suddenne&s;s of their Choice.
For if I might depend upon the Character I have
receiv'd of the Ladies of <HI>Languedoc,</HI> and 'tis almo&s;t
impo&s;&s;ible for one who has convers'd with 'em to
doubt of the Truth of it; a Man cannot tru&s;t his
Heart in better Hands, nor make a more advantage|ous
Re&s;ignation of his Liberty. They are naturally
Loving, Complai&s;ant, and Con&s;tant even to Death;
and be&s;ides they are generally of a very plea&s;ant
Humour, and all their Actions are accompany'd
with a certain Amorous Air that &s;eems always to de|mand
a Heart, and puts it out of the Owner's Pow|er
to refu&s;e it. 'Tis not without an extreme Di&s;|plea&s;ure
that I mu&s;t content my &s;elf with relating
what I heard on this Occa&s;ion, and that I cannot
add my own Experience to the Te&s;timony of others;
but I cannot pretend to the Happine&s;s of tho&s;e who
find Fortune ready to compliment 'em with a Mi|&s;tre&s;s
at their fir&s;t Arrival: and &s;ince the main De|&s;ign
of my Travels wou'd not &s;uffer me to &s;tay long
in this Place, I &s;aw my &s;elf depriv'd of a Plea&s;ure of
which I had conceiv'd &s;o agreeable an <HI>Idea,</HI> and
left with an extreme Reluctancy, that lovely Coun|try,
where the Cu&s;toms and Manner of Living are
&s;o &s;uitable to my Genius and Inclinations. But at
my Return to this Place I was &s;omewhat comforted
by a late In&s;tance of the Misfortunes of Love, and
my Grief was in &s;ome mea&s;ure abated, when I re|flected
on all the Troubles and Di&s;a&s;ters that u&s;ually
attend a Pa&s;&s;ion from which we expect nothing but
the Enjoyment of undi&s;turb'd Delight and Satis|faction.</P>
<P>Two Young Pilgrims betwixt the Age of Twen|ty
and Twenty two Years, pa&s;s'd thro' this City
about three Months ago, and like the re&s;t of tho&s;e
mi&s;erable Wanderers, who rove about the World
<PB N="92" REF="63">
under the Protection of a Pilgrim's Staff, were con|&s;train'd
to take up their Lodging at the Ho&s;pital <HI>de
la Charit&eacute;,</HI> where one of 'em, not longer able to
endure the Fatigues, Cold, Hunger, and perpetual
Want of every thing that is nece&s;&s;ary for Life, &s;unk
at la&s;t under &s;uch an in&s;upportable Load of Mi&s;e|ry,
and fell into a Fever, accompany'd with &s;o great
a Weakne&s;s, that the Surgeons began to de&s;pair
of his Recovery. His Companion &s;eeing him in
this Condition, was &s;o overwhelm'd with Sorrow,
that the very Servants of the Ho&s;pital, who were
wont to be unconcern'd Spectators of &s;uch Acci|dents,
were touch'd with Compa&s;&s;ion: He never
&s;tirr'd from his &s;ick Friend's Bed-&s;ide, gave him his
Broth, &s;erv'd him with a wonderful Zeal and
A&s;&s;iduity, and wou'd not &s;uffer any other to come
near him. The &s;ick Per&s;on, on the other &s;ide,
was not pleas'd with any thing but what came
from the Hands of his belov'd Companion, and
receiv'd his Services with all the Marks of Grati|tude,
and of a mo&s;t tender Affection. In the mean
time the Sickne&s;s of the one, and the Grief of the
other were daily and equally augmented: The di&s;|con&s;olate
Mourner embrac'd his dying Friend every
Moment, and bath'd his Face with Tears. At
la&s;t, on the Ninth Day, the Feaver was &s;ucceed|ed
by a violent <HI>Cri&s;is,</HI> and the &s;ick Pilgrim, after
&s;ome Convul&s;ions, fell into a Swoon, and was
thought to be dead. His Friend then lo&s;ing all
Patience, gave him&s;elf up entirely to the Exce&s;s
of his Grief, and throwing him&s;elf upon the dear
Body, with the Tran&s;ports of a De&s;pair, that
melted the Hearts of all the A&s;&s;i&s;tants, bur&s;t forth
into Lamentations, which di&s;cover'd his &s;ecret, and
made 'em know that the Per&s;on whom they hi|therto
treated as a poor Pilgrim, was a young
Lady: <HI>Alas! my dear N...</HI> cry'd he, <HI>Thou art no
more! Thy fair Eyes are &s;hut for ever! 'Tis done&mdash;
<PB N="93" REF="63">
Thou ha&s;t lo&s;t thy dear Life, and 'tis I who have robb'd
thee of it. Ah! my Love! my Soul!</HI> continu'd he,
<HI>thou ha&s;t paid dear for thy Love to me, who am the
wretched occa&s;ion of thy Death in thy mo&s;t blooming Age.
Ah! fatal Love! cruel Parents! unfortunate, and too-loving
Daughter!</HI> The&s;e, and &s;uch-like Exclama|tions
he utter'd with unconceivable De&s;pair, for
the &s;pace of a quarter of an Hour; after which,
perceiving that &s;he &s;how'd &s;ome Signs of Life,
he &s;ent immediately for a Phy&s;ician, and throw|ing
him&s;elf at his Feet, <HI>Sir,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>I conjure you
by all that is dear to you in the World, refu&s;e not your
A&s;&s;i&s;tance to this young Maid: She is a Per&s;on of Quali|ty,
and de&s;erves your utmo&s;t Care for her Pre&s;ervation:
Leave no Means unattempted; &s;pare no Co&s;t, Sir, I be|&s;eech
you, and be confident that you &s;hall not lo&s;e your
Labour; you &s;hall have whatever you plea&s;e to demand;
take my promi&s;e, and you &s;hall find me to be a Man of
Honour.</HI> The Phy&s;ician being mov'd with Compa&s;|&s;ion,
a&s;&s;ur'd him that the &s;ick Per&s;on &s;hou'd not
Peri&s;h by his Neglect: And after he had admini|&s;ter'd
&s;uch Remedies as were mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary in
her pre&s;ent Condition, he begg'd her Lover to
inform him who they were, and by what Acci|dent
they fell into &s;uch deplorable Circum&s;tances.
The young Man told him, that he was a Native
of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and born a Gentleman, tho' with a
very &s;mall Fortune; That he fell in Love with
this young Lady, who was of a very Rich and
Honourable Family; That She requited his Love
with a Reciprocal Affection, notwith&s;tanding the
Oppo&s;ition made by her Father, and all the re&s;t
of her Family, who de&s;igning to &s;ettle her Advan|tageou&s;ly
in the World, wou'd never be per&s;uaded
to accept of &s;o poor a Son-in-Law; That, never|thele&s;s,
they kept a Corre&s;pendence for two Years,
giving and receiving all the Marks of an unex|pre&s;&s;ible
Tenderne&s;s, and confirming by mutual
<PB N="94" REF="64">
and repeated Oaths, their re&s;olution to die, rather than
to be guilty of the lea&s;t Infidelity; That her Father
having provided a con&s;iderable Match for her, wou'd
have forc'd her to comply with his Inclinations;
That She rejected the Propo&s;al with great Con|&s;tancy,
and was very rigorou&s;ly treated by her
Father on that Occa&s;ion; and, That when &s;he
cou'd not re&s;i&s;t any longer, they re&s;olv'd to make
their E&s;cape, chu&s;ing rather to live poorly and
mi&s;erably together, than to purcha&s;e the Enjoy|ment
of a plentiful Fortune at the rate of being
for ever &s;eparated. In pur&s;uance of that De&s;ign,
as he inform'd the Phy&s;ician, he &s;eiz'd on one of
her Father's Hor&s;es, and after &s;he had di&s;guis'd
her &s;elf in a Man's Habit, he brought her to <HI>Paris,</HI>
where their Money failing, they were forc'd to &s;ell
their Hor&s;e; and that little Stock being al&s;o ex|hau&s;ted,
they were reduc'd to the mi&s;erable Con|dition
in which he found 'em: <HI>'Yet,</HI> added he,
<HI>we were firmly re&s;olv'd to &s;pend the Remainder of our
Lives like wretched Vagabonds, rather than to &s;ubmit to
the Tyranny of our Relations, if this fatal Sickne&s;s had
not made me alter my Re&s;olution. I cannot longer bear,</HI>
continu'd he, <HI>the &s;ight of &s;o di&s;mal an Object: My
Con&s;tancy is overcome by her Sufferings; and if God
wou'd vouch&s;afe to re&s;tore her Health, I de&s;ign to carry
her back to her Father; tho' con&s;idering the extreme
Violence of his Humour, I cannot expect a milder
Puni&s;hment than Death, for the Injury he pretends I
have done him.</HI></P>
<P>The Phy&s;ician, who is a very Humane Per|&s;on,
was &s;truck with Compa&s;&s;ion at the Recital
of their Mi&s;fortunes, and promis'd to a&s;&s;i&s;t 'em not
only as a Phy&s;ician, but as a Friend. Immedi|ately
he order'd the young Lady to be taken out
of the na&s;ty Couch where &s;he lay, and to be car|ry'd
to a convenient Chamber; where &s;he was
laid in a good Bed, and carefully attended till
<PB N="95" REF="64">
her Recovery, which happen'd not long after.
In the mean time, he made their Condition known
to the Bi&s;hop, who, as I told you in my la&s;t, is
none of tho&s;e moro&s;e Cen&s;urers, who exclaim
again&s;t the lea&s;t Breach of the Rules of Decency;
and indeed, he was &s;en&s;ibly touch'd with the di&s;a&s;t'rous
Condition of the&s;e &s;orrowful Lovers; and admi|ring
the odd Effects of Love and Fortune, he look'd
upon 'em as Objects of Compa&s;&s;ion, and a&s;&s;ur'd
'em, that it &s;hou'd not be his Fault, if their Suf|ferings
were not crown'd with the Happine&s;s they
de&s;erv'd. They were &s;oon &s;en&s;ible of the Sinceri|ty
of his Kindne&s;s; for he joyn'd 'em together
in Marriage, Cloath'd 'em, and entertain'd 'em;
till having written to their Relations, and obtain'd
their pardon, he &s;ent them back to their own
Country. To keep you from &s;u&s;pecting the Truth
of this Relation, 'twill be &s;ufficient to acquaint
you, that 'tis not above Fifteen Days &s;ince that
admirable pair of Lovers departed from this Place.
I am &s;o much in Love with the Bi&s;hop's Gene|ro&s;ity
on this Occa&s;ion, and even I think my &s;elf
&s;o extremely oblig'd to him for it, that I know
nothing &s;o difficult, which I wou'd not undertake
for his Service: And I'm confident that a Man
who is capable of performing an Action of that
Nature, mu&s;t infallibly be Ma&s;ter of all the <HI>Car|dinal</HI>
Virtues.</P>
<P>And to convince you that he is no le&s;s remark|able
for his Prudence, and the &s;olidity of his Judg|ment,
I &s;hall add one Story more before I fini&s;h
my Letter.</P>
<P>About four or five Months ago, the Convent
of the Monks of S. <HI>Anthony</HI> in this City began to
be haunted with one of tho&s;e Ill-natur'd Spirits,
who not contenting them&s;elves with making a
frightful Noi&s;e, beat and knock down all that
come in their Way. The Monks who came out
<PB N="96" REF="65">
of their Chambers at Night, were the chief Sufferers
by the&s;e Di&s;orders; for their trouble&s;ome Gue&s;t
watch'd 'em &s;o narrowly, and was &s;o exact in walk|ing
his Rounds, that 'twas impo&s;&s;ible to &s;tir abroad
without falling into his Clutches; and he always
be&s;tow'd &s;o furious a Correction on tho&s;e whom
he caught &s;traggling, that they dur&s;t not venture
out of Doors from &s;ix a-clock at Night to &s;ix in
the Morning: And even tho&s;e who had the Wit
to keep out of harms way, cou'd not e&s;cape alto|gether
unmole&s;ted; for they were terrify'd with
the Clinking of Chains, and &s;uch other Noi&s;es
that are u&s;ually a&s;crib'd to returning Spirits. There
were &s;everal Chapters held on this Occa&s;ion, and
the Fathers &s;till concluded that their deceas'd Prior's
Gho&s;t was come either to impart &s;ome Matter of
Importance to 'em, or to ask &s;ome Que&s;tions,
and that there was none of 'em worthy to be
his Confident, or to be acquainted with the Rea|&s;on
why he gave 'em &s;o many unwelcome Vi&s;its.
After &s;ome time &s;pent in Deliberation, 'twas re|&s;olv'd
to &s;ay a great Number of Ma&s;&s;es for his
Soul, and to keep as clo&s;e as they cou'd for the
future, to avoid coming within the reach of his Fi&s;ts.
In the mean time this wondrous Gho&s;t was the com|mon
Subject of the publick Talk, and of the Ser|mons
of the Monks, who &s;how'd the print of his
Hand on the Wall of the Refectory, and offer'd
a Reward of 100 Crowns to any Man that wou'd
undertake to lodge there, and &s;peak to the Gho&s;t,
that they might know what he wanted. This
was a very welcome piece of News to one <HI>Blan|chet,</HI>
a Native of <HI>Paris,</HI> who had &s;o much Cou|rage,
and &s;o little Money, that he might have
been ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to expo&s;e him&s;elf to far greater
Dangers for a le&s;s con&s;iderable Summ. Immediate|ly
he went to the Fathers, and offer'd 'em his
Service, a&s;&s;uring 'em he would talk to the Spirit,

and endeavour to procure 'em Satisfaction. The
Monks embrac'd the Propo&s;al, and the Bargain
was concluded: But the Bi&s;hop, hearing of &s;o
gro&s;s an Abu&s;e, &s;ent for the Superiour, and ha|ving
reproach'd him with Weakne&s;s and Super|&s;tition,
forbid him to &s;uffer that Man to lodge
in the Hou&s;e, or to &s;how the print of the Hnad
to any Per&s;on what&s;oever; adding, That &s;uch a
Circum&s;tance was very un&s;uitable to the Nature
of a Spirit, and that he ought rather to watch
him&s;elf, than to entru&s;t the Management of an
Affair of that Nature to another. <HI>Blanchet,</HI> ac|cording
to his Promi&s;e, came in the Evening,
arm'd <HI>Cap-a-pee;</HI> but in&s;tead of his expected Re|ward,
he was di&s;mi&s;s'd with a Compliment.
Some Days after, my Curio&s;ity prompted me to
de&s;ire a Sight of the Hand; but the Monks re|fus'd
me that Favour, excu&s;ing them&s;elves upon
the Bi&s;hop's Prohibition. I applauded his Wi&s;|dom,
and took the Liberty to tell 'em, That they
&s;hou'd not &s;uffer them&s;elves to be frighted into
the belief of an Apparition, till they were con|vinc'd
of the Truth of it by a &s;trict Examination
of all the Circum&s;tances; and that they ought not
to in&s;till Super&s;tition into the Minds of the Peo|ple,
&s;ince they were naturally too much inclin'd
to it. The Monk to whom I addre&s;t my Di&s;cour&s;e,
was &s;o offended at it, that I was almo&s;t afraid
he wou'd have pull'd out my Eyes: He wonder'd
what cou'd move me to offer him &s;uch Advice,
and ask'd whether I took him, and all his Illu|&s;trious
Brethren, for a Company of <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;ts.</HI>
My Freedom had irritated him &s;o extremely, that
he was incapable of Rea&s;on, and therefore I left
him. But the Bi&s;hop's Conduct, and my Opini|on,
were &s;ufficiently ju&s;tify'd by an Accident that
happen'd &s;ome Days after. A certain Captain of
a Galley coming one Night to Sup with another
<PB N="98" REF="68">
Captain, who&s;e Hou&s;e is very near the Convent,
left his Chairmen below, who being &s;urpriz'd with
a violent Shower, carry'd the Chair into the Court
of the Mona&s;tery, and plac'd it under a Portico;
where one of 'em &s;itting down in it, fell into &s;o
deep a Sleep that he perceiv'd not when the
Gate was &s;hut, and wak'd not till Midnight. His
unwillingne&s;s to di&s;turb the Fathers at &s;uch an
un&s;ea&s;onable Hour, made him re&s;olve to &s;it in his
Chair till next Morning: And an Hour after, he
&s;aw a Per&s;on cover'd from Head to Foot with a
long Black Gown, who having open'd the Gate
of the Court with a Key, began to walk up and
down, and cough'd &s;everal times very &s;oftly. The
poor Chairman was at fir&s;t &s;truck with Terrour,
for he was one of tho&s;e who believ'd the Story
of the Apparition; but being a Man of Re&s;olu|tion,
he took Courage, and ob&s;erv'd the Motions
of the Spirit. Not long after one of the Monks
appear'd at a Window, and ask'd &s;oftly, <HI>Are you
there? Yes,</HI> &s;aid the Gho&s;t, <HI>Throw down the Rope.
You have &s;taid very long,</HI> reply'd the Father; and
crying <HI>'&s;t,</HI> two or three times, let fall a Ladder of
Ropes, by the help of which, the Spirit got into
the Convent, and three Hours after came down
again, and went out. Next Morning the Chair|man
divulg'd the Secret; and 'twas afterwards
di&s;cover'd that the pretended Gho&s;t was a Whore,
whom one of the Monks brought into the Con|vent
every Night, having invented that Di&s;gui&s;e
to fright tho&s;e who might &s;ee his Mi&s;tre&s;s: And
lea&s;t any of his Companions &s;hou'd come out of
their Cells, and di&s;turb his Plea&s;ures, he drag'd
Chains thro' the Dormitory, knock'd at the Doors,
and beat tho&s;e whom he met &s;o unmercifully,
that their Fears were much greater than their
Curio&s;ity. This Accident has &s;o extremely le&s;|&s;en'd
the Reputation of tho&s;e Fathers, who be|fore
<PB N="99" REF="68">
this Di&s;covery were thought to live pret|ty
regularly, that at pre&s;ent they dare not
&s;how their Faces: And <HI>S. Anthony's Gho&s;t</HI> is be|come
a proverbial Expre&s;&s;ion, or &s;ofter Term for
a <HI>Whore.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this Letter with telling you,

<HEAD>LETTER IX.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFter I have told you that we &s;et &s;ail from <HI>Mar|&s;eilles</HI>
on the 25<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>March,</HI> you mu&s;t not
expect to hear more News of us till our Land|ing;
for I cannot imagine what plea&s;ure you
cou'd take in reading, that on &s;uch a Day the
<HI>South</HI> or <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> Winds were contrary to us, or that
we were forc'd to tack about to the <HI>North</HI> or
<HI>We&s;t.</HI> I'm &s;o far from looking upon the Sea as my
Element, that I never found the lea&s;t Inclination
to be acquainted with it. Be&s;ides, Sir, I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s
I'm naturally apt to judge of others by my
&s;elf; and therefore when I remember how often
I have skip'd over &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ages in the Relations
of Travellers, I cannot forbear concluding that
you wou'd be as little pleas'd with &s;o dull an En|tertainment.
Since then you will have the Ad|vantage
of pa&s;&s;ing from one Port to another,
without feeling the Inconveniencies of bad Wea|ther,
or being troubl'd with the Noi&s;y Hurry of
the Mariners, I hope you will be the more ea&s;ily
per&s;uaded to &s;top a while with me at the I&s;les
of <HI>If,</HI> where we &s;pent a whole Day at Anchor,
after we came out of the Port of <HI>Mar&s;eilles.</HI></P>
<P>The I&s;les of <HI>If</HI> are three &s;mall I&s;lands about three
Miles di&s;tant from <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> forming a very &s;afe
Harbour again&s;t any &s;orts of Wind, which is de|fended
by two &s;trong Ca&s;tles, where the King
keeps a Garri&s;on. The&s;e I&s;lands are of great Im|portance
to &s;ecure the Trade of <HI>Mar&s;eilles;</HI> for
without the Advantage of their Neighbourhood,
that City wou'd be a kind of Pri&s;on, &s;ince
<PB N="101" REF="69">
'twou'd be impo&s;&s;ible for any Ve&s;&s;els to go out
of the Port, without expo&s;ing them&s;elves to the
In&s;ults of their Enemies: And be&s;ides, the Storms
that are &s;o frequent in the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> wou'd
drive many Ships upon the Shoar, if they had not
the Conveniency of &s;tanding into this Harbour.
But notwith&s;tanding the Advantageous Situation
of the&s;e I&s;lands, and the great Importance of the
Harbour for the Security of Trade, they were
mortgag'd by one of our Kings to the Duke of
<HI>Florence,</HI> for &s;ix hundred thou&s;and Crowns. Whil&s;t
the Princes of that Family injoy'd the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of this Po&s;t, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> left no means une&s;&s;ay'd
to make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of it; but they were ei|ther
re&s;olv'd to keep it in their own Power, or
afraid to incur the Anger of the <HI>French,</HI> &s;ince 'tis
certain that they rejected all the Propo&s;als that
were made to 'em upon this Occa&s;ion. The&s;e
I&s;lands were afterwards reunited to the Crown,
by the Marriage of <HI>Mary de Medicis</HI> with <HI>Henry</HI> the
<HI>Fourth.</HI> And the Succe&s;s of that Negotiation was in
a great mea&s;ure owing to the Marqui&s;s <HI>de Pile,</HI>
who was then Governour of the Place; for he
made Duke <HI>Francis</HI> &s;en&s;ible, that 'twas better to
comply with the De&s;ires of that Monarch, than
to engage him&s;elf in a War with &s;o potent an
Enemy. In con&s;ideration of &s;o acceptable a piece
of Service, the Marqui&s;s was continu'd in his
former Po&s;t, and the Rever&s;ion of his Office was
be&s;tow'd on his Son, who died there, leaving
two Sons, the elder of whom, who enjoys his Grand|father's
Title, &s;ucceeded in the Government of
the&s;e I&s;lands; and the younger, call'd the Count
<HI>de Forville,</HI> was made Governour <HI>Viguier</HI> of <HI>Mar|&s;eilles,</HI>
and Captain of one of the King's Galleys;
the yearly Revenue of the&s;e two Places amount|ing
to 20000 Livres.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="70">
To make amends for the le&s;s favourable part
of the Character I gave you of the Natives of
<HI>Prov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nce,</HI> I &s;hall take this Occa&s;ion to acquaint
you with &s;ome of their better Qualities: For I
love to do Ju&s;tice to all Men; and be&s;ides, I
wou'd willingly make my Peace with the Inha|bitants,
before I leave their Country: They are
very good Mariners, and are famous over all <HI>Eu|rope</HI>
for their Indu&s;try and Diligence: Nor are
they le&s;s remarkable for their Courage and Bra|very;
for they are &s;o little capable of Fear, that
they wou'd reckon it a piece of Cowardice to
turn their Backs to ten times their Number of
Enemies. Not very long ago, our Captain's Un|cle,
call'd <HI>Blai&s;e Marin,</HI> in a Ship of Forty Guns,
maintain'd a Fight for three Days together, during
a Calm, again&s;t five <HI>Tripolin</HI> Men of War, with &s;o
much Re&s;olution and Succe&s;s, that they were forc'd
at la&s;t to leave him. And a &s;mall Bark of thir|ty
Men, was about a Year ago &s;natch'd out of
the very Jaws of the <HI>Algerines,</HI> by the Prudence
and Bravery of the Pilot. She was chas'd by one
of the large&s;t of the Enemy's Ships, in which
there were four hundred Men, till &s;eeing no po&s;|&s;ibility
of e&s;caping, that Handful of Men re&s;olv'd
to board the Ship that pur&s;u'd 'em, without
lowering their Sails, or grappling the Ve&s;&s;els to|gether:
And the Pilot leaping on board the Ene|my's
Ship, with his Curtelas in his Hand, cut
the Rope that &s;u&s;tain'd their Main-Sail, which
they cou'd not hoi&s;e again in above three Hours.
In the mean time the Pilot jump'd into his own
Bark, and Crying, <HI>Courage, my Boys, we're &s;av'd,</HI>
&s;teer'd away from the Enemy, who could never
afterwards come up with him. The Merchants at his
Return, pre&s;ented him with a Gold Medal; nor
cou'd they in Ju&s;tice do le&s;s Honour to &s;o rare
a Merit. But they will not be &s;o kind to a Cap|tain,
<PB N="103" REF="70">
call'd <HI>Curet,</HI> who had the Misfortune to be
taken by the Galleys of <HI>Naples</HI> about three Months
ago: For tho' he had only 24 Guns mounted,
and 100 Men on board, to re&s;i&s;t &s;even Galleys
that attack'd him; his Countrymen exclaim a|gain&s;t
him as the ba&s;e&s;t of Cowards; and I know
not whether 'twill ever be &s;afe for him to &s;how
his Face at <HI>Mar&s;eilles.</HI> But after all, this &s;eems to
be a Rodomontade, rather than an effect of true
Courage; &s;ince it mu&s;t be acknowledg'd that &s;e|ven
Galleys are a very unequal Match for the
&s;tronge&s;t Merchant-Ship in the World.</P>
<P>Three Days after our departure from <HI>If,</HI> we
arriv'd at <HI>Genoa,</HI> which you know is u&s;ually call'd
<HI>Genoa the Proud,</HI> tho' in my Opinion it cannot pre|tend
the lea&s;t Right to that Title: 'Tis the Ca|pital
City of <HI>Liguria,</HI> and had its Name from <HI>Ja|nus</HI>
the fir&s;t, King of <HI>Italy;</HI> or according to o|thers,
from <HI>double-fac'd Janus.</HI> Some make this
<HI>Janus</HI> King of the <HI>To&iuml;ans;</HI> and others deduce
the Etymology of the Word from <HI>Janua,</HI> a <HI>Gate,</HI>
or <HI>Door;</HI> becau&s;e <HI>Genoa</HI> is as it were the Gate of
<HI>Italy.</HI> Authors are generally much divided con|cerning
the true Name of this City: <HI>Luitprand,
Tircin,</HI> and &s;ome others, call it <HI>Janua; Titus Livi|us,
Ptolomy,</HI> and <HI>Strabo,</HI> give it the Name of <HI>Ge|nua;</HI>
and the latter Opinion &s;eems to be better
grounded than the former, e&s;pecially &s;ince 'tis
confirm'd by a &s;mall Copper-Plate, which is to
be &s;een in this Place, and was found <HI>Ann.</HI> 1507.
by a Pea&s;ant, as he was Tilling the Ground. The
In&s;cription is engrav'd in very &s;mall, but pretty
di&s;tinct, <HI>Roman</HI> Characters; and in it the <HI>Genoe&s;e</HI>
are call'd <HI>Genuates.</HI></P>
<P>The time of its Foundation is unknown, at
lea&s;t I never had the Fortune to meet with a
&s;atisfactory Account of it in any Author, either
Ancient or Modern. 'Tis &s;eated at the bottom
<PB N="104" REF="71">
of a little Gulf, on the Declivity, and at the Foot
of a Hill, &s;eeming to con&s;i&s;t of &s;everal Stories.
The Port lies very open towards the Sea, and
therefore cannot afford &s;afe Anchorage for Ships.
The City contains five and thirty Pari&s;hes; the
Streets are uneven, and very narrow, tho' the
Hou&s;es are extremely high. In the middle of the
<HI>Publick Place,</HI> there is a Marble Statue of an unu&s;ual
bigne&s;s, repre&s;enting <HI>Andrew Doria,</HI> the Deliverer of
the Republick, trampling on three <HI>Turks</HI> Heads,
in Memory of the &s;ignal Victories he obtain'd
over the&s;e Infidels. The Palaces of <HI>Genoa</HI> are ve|ry
much admir'd; and it mu&s;t be acknowledg'd
that &s;ome of 'em are very fine Structures; but
the principal Beauty of tho&s;e few that de&s;erve
that Title, con&s;i&s;ts in the <HI>Marble</HI> of which they
are built.</P>
<P><HI>Marble</HI> is no Rarity in this Country; all the
Churches are adorn'd with it, as well as the <HI>Pa|lace
Royal,</HI> where his Serenity keeps his Re&s;idence:
But after all, you mu&s;t not imagine that the
Streets are pav'd with it. Since we &s;taid but
two Days in the City, I cou'd not find an Op|portunity
to &s;ee the In&s;ide of any of the Pala|ces,
and therefore I cannot &s;atisfie your Curio&s;i|ty
with a De&s;cription of 'em. You are &s;o well
acquainted with the nature of the Government,
that 'twou'd be needle&s;s to give you any farther
Account of it; only I cannot forbear taking no|tice
of the extreme Decrea&s;e of the Power and
Grandeur of this Republick &s;ince tho&s;e glorious
Days, when they extended their Conque&s;ts to
the <HI>Tanais,</HI> and made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of all
the Coa&s;ts of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and the I&s;lands of <HI>Cyprus,
Scio, Lesbos,</HI> &amp;c. They &s;till retain a little I&s;land,
with the Title of a Kingdom, and are extremely
proud of it, tho', in my Opinion, without any
rea&s;on. The Habits of the Nobles re&s;emble tho&s;e
<PB N="105" REF="71">
of the Coun&s;ellors in <HI>France;</HI> they dare not wear
Gold or Silver when they come abroad; but in
their Hou&s;es they have very rich Ve&s;ts, and co&s;t|ly
Night-Gowns.</P>
<P>Since the late Bombardment of the City, they
cannot endure tho&s;e of our Nation. They &s;how'd
me a Convent of Nuns, into which there fell
not one Bomb, tho' there were above a hun|dred
&s;hot at it; and told me, that there was a
Hand &s;een in the Air, which diverted their
Cour&s;e, and threw 'em another way. The <HI>Jews,</HI>
who are dete&s;ted by all the World, were in great
Favour here during tho&s;e terrible Di&s;orders, be|cau&s;e
they found out a way to quench the Bombs
with Ox Hides: Yet this is not a new Inventi|on;
for the &s;ame was practi&s;ed long before by
the Inhabitants of <HI>Groningen,</HI> when they were be|&s;ieg'd
by the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> in 1672: And
&s;ince that time the <HI>Algerines</HI> made u&s;e of the &s;ame
Secret; be&s;ides the covering of their Streets with
Sand. Nor is there any thing wonderful in the
Succe&s;s of this Stratagem; for one may ea&s;ily and
infallibly &s;mother a Bomb if he can come in
time to &s;top the Hole before the Fu&s;ee be &s;pent.
At the A&s;&s;ault of the Horn-Work at <HI>Philipsburg,</HI>
I &s;aw a Soldier take the &s;ame way to prevent
the Effect of the Granadoes, which the <HI>Germans</HI>
threw among us: For he gather'd 'em as they
fell, and &s;topping the Touch-Hole with his Hand,
either &s;mother'd 'em immediately, or threw 'em
back upon the Enemies. But tho' this may be
ea&s;ily done, it cannot be attempted without Dan|ger;
for the Fu&s;ee is always made as &s;hort as
po&s;&s;ible; and if the Fire &s;hou'd happen to reach
the Powder when the Man throws him&s;elf upon
the Bomb, the &s;hutting out of the Air wou'd on|ly
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> it bur&s;t the &s;ooner.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="72">
But tho' the &s;hortne&s;s of our &s;tay at <HI>Genoa</HI>
wou'd not permit me to gratifie your Curio&s;ity
with an Account of the Beauties and Rarities of
that City; I confe&s;s I cannot pretend the &s;ame
Excu&s;e for declining to undertake the De&s;cription
of <HI>Rome, Florence,</HI> and the place where I am at
pre&s;ent. I have &s;pent two whole Months in exa|mining
and admiring that infinite Number of
Wonders that &s;eem to have been brought from
all the parts of the World, and &s;hut up in this
Country, as in a va&s;t <HI>Repo&s;itory.</HI> I have even
wallow'd in Delight, and been kept in a conti|nual
Rapture with the amazing View of &s;o many
noble <HI>Structures,</HI> augu&s;t Monuments of <HI>Antiquity,</HI>
ine&s;timable <HI>Libraries, Statues, Pictures,</HI> Works of
<HI>Marble</HI> and <HI>Porphyrie,</HI> and a Thou&s;and other Cu|rio&s;ities,
of which there is a prodigious and even
incredible Abundance in the&s;e places. I have &s;een
all the&s;e magnificent Rarities; I have view'd 'em
with all imaginable Plea&s;ure and Attention, and
my Mind is &s;till full of their agreeable <HI>Idea</HI>'s; but
tho' I have not forgot what I promis'd you, nei|ther
the Con&s;ideration of your Satisfaction, nor
of my own Engagement, can make me willing
to keep my Promi&s;e with re&s;pect to <HI>Italy.</HI> You
mu&s;t e'en give me leave to claim the Privilege
of a <HI>Norman</HI> once in my Life; and you will ea&s;i|ly
di&s;pen&s;e with the Account you expected from
me, if you peru&s;e the Relations of &s;o many <HI>Tra|vellers,</HI>
who have vi&s;ited this lovely Country from
one end to the other, e&s;pecially the late Work of
Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mi&s;&s;on:</HI> For what can be added to &s;o
exact a De&s;cription? Is there any Corner in <HI>Italy,</HI>
that has e&s;cap'd his inqui&s;itive Curio&s;ity, or any
thing remarkable in it which he has not illu|&s;trated
with Learned and Judicious Reflexions?
He is a compleat Traveller; he has forgot nothing
that de&s;erves to be taken notice of, and has &s;o
<PB N="107" REF="72">
intirely exhau&s;ted his Subject, that there is no|thing
left for future Ob&s;ervers. And therefore,
in&s;tead of de&s;cribing <HI>Italy,</HI> I &s;hall only de&s;ire you
to con&s;ult his Book, by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of which,
you may make one of the plea&s;ante&s;t Voyages in
the World without going out of your Clo&s;et.
But &s;ince you will perhaps expect that I &s;hou'd
at lea&s;t add &s;omething to convince you that I
have &s;een the&s;e celebrated Places, I &s;hall adven|ture
to tell you, that among &s;o many admirable
Rarities that fill'd me with Wonder and Amaze|ment,
there is nothing, in my Opinion, more ex|traordinary
and &s;urpri&s;ing than the Pomp and Mag|nificence
of the <HI>Court of Rome.</HI> I know not whe|ther
this Remark will make amends for my Si|lence
in other Re&s;pects: You'll perhaps tell me,
that 'tis a &s;tale and trivial Ob&s;ervation: However,
you mu&s;t give me leave to a&s;&s;ure you, that 'tis
not an ea&s;ie Task to repre&s;ent all its Wonders;
and I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that hitherto I had never any
<HI>Idea</HI> of it, that did not come &s;hort of the Truth.
The <HI>Court of Rome</HI> is no le&s;s Numerous and Magni|ficent
than that of <HI>France;</HI> and perhaps I might
venture to &s;ay, that the <HI>latter</HI> is exceeded by the
<HI>former.</HI> Every <HI>Cardinal</HI> is a Prince, who receives
daily all the Marks of Honour and Re&s;pect from
a Thou&s;and Prelates, and other Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks, that
look upon him as their Sovereign, and place their
whole Felicity in his Favour. Nothing is want|ing
to compleat the Splendor of their Dignity:
Magnificent Palaces, rich Furnitures, delicious
Tables, Plea&s;ure-Hou&s;es, Gardens, Grotto's, Foun|tains,
numerous Trains of Servants, and, to crown
all, the Conver&s;ation and Society of the hand&s;ome&s;t
Ladies in <HI>Europe;</HI> for you mu&s;t not imagine that their
Character confines 'em to all the Au&s;terities of a Mo|na&s;tick
Life; and, excepting only &s;ome <HI>Gray-Bearded
Dotards,</HI> that pretend to the <HI>Popedom,</HI> the
<PB N="108" REF="73">
re&s;t are as Gay and Amorous as any young <HI>French</HI>
Prince. 'Twou'd be needle&s;s to apply this Cha|racter
particularly to all the Members of the <HI>Sa|cred
College;</HI> and therefore I &s;hall content my &s;elf
with a&s;&s;uring you, that none de&s;erves it more ju&s;t|ly
than the <HI>Cardinal Patron,</HI> who has acquir'd &s;o
Univer&s;al a Reputation of an accompli&s;h'd Gal|lant,
that 'tis generally reckon'd the mo&s;t effectual
way to obtain a Favour of him, to make u&s;e of
the Interce&s;&s;ion of a <HI>Lady;</HI> and even he &s;cruples
not to declare, that he has not the Force to re|fu&s;e
any thing to a <HI>fair Petitioner.</HI></P>
<P>Tho&s;e who love <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI> and <HI>Luxury,</HI> cannot de|&s;ire
a more favourable Treatment than they meet
with under the pre&s;ent Pontificate. The <HI>Holy Fa|ther</HI>
encourages 'em by his own Example; his
Table and Furniture are Magnificent, and his
<HI>Nephews</HI> re&s;emble &s;o many Sovereigns. The Prince
<HI>Mark</HI> is attended with a Train of forty Lacqueys,
all clad in a Livery of Cloth of Gold, and his Stable
is furni&s;h'd with &s;ixty of the fine&s;t Hor&s;es in <HI>Rome;</HI>
tho' all this is a manife&s;t Violation of the Edicts
that were publi&s;h'd to regulate the Affairs of the
<HI>Nepoti&s;m.</HI> 'Tis true, the People grumble extremely
to &s;ee their Sub&s;tance exhau&s;ted, and the very
Blood drain'd out of their Bodies, to maintain
the extravagant Vanity of tho&s;e <HI>Up&s;tart Favourites,</HI>
who about a Year ago were as poor as them|&s;elves.
But among &s;o many Marks of Splendour,
there is nothing more &s;urprizing, than the Mag|nificent
<HI>Gondola's,</HI> built by the Pope's Orders,
which are the fir&s;t that ever grac'd the <HI>Tiber.</HI>
His Holine&s;s goes thither very often to take the
Air, accompany'd with tho&s;e that have the great|e&s;t
Share in his Favour; and 'tis thought he de|&s;igns
to bring the <HI>Venetian Fre&s;co</HI> into Fa&s;hion at
<HI>Rome,</HI> which in my Opinion is a Project that
may be ea&s;ily accompli&s;h'd, &s;ince the <HI>Roman</HI> Ladies
<PB N="109" REF="73">
love to be &s;een, as well as the re&s;t of the Fair
Sex.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Luxury and Vanity of
the pre&s;ent Pope, gives occa&s;ion to &s;everal well-di&s;pos'd
Per&s;ons, to make Compari&s;ons between
his Conduct, and that of his Predece&s;&s;our, which
you may rea&s;onably conclude are not in the lea&s;t
Advantageous to his Holine&s;s: For there is cer|tainly
a very remarkable Difference between the&s;e
two Pontiffs: He who at pre&s;ent fills the Chair,
makes it his only bu&s;ine&s;s to gratifie his Incli|nation
to Plea&s;ure, and to Aggrandize his Fami|ly;
whereas the good Pope <HI>Innocent</HI> apply'd him|&s;elf
only to the performance of the Duties of his
Office, reforming the Abu&s;es that had crept into
<HI>Rome,</HI> vi&s;iting the Ho&s;pitals, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Poor.
And be&s;ides, he left no Means une&s;&s;ay'd, to re|&s;tore
Peace to <HI>Chri&s;tendom:</HI> And when an unju&s;t
Power endeavour'd to extend its U&s;urpations to
the Church it &s;elf, we had the Plea&s;ure to &s;ee
that generous Prelate oppo&s;e the incroaching Ty|ranny,
with a Re&s;olution and Piety worthy of
a Common Father. His Private Life, and Dome|&s;tick
Occupations, were no le&s;s Edifying: He
was ea&s;ie of Acce&s;s to all Men, and hearken'd
favourably to the Poor when they came to re|pre&s;ent
their Grievances to him, or to beg his
A&s;&s;i&s;tance. His external Deportment was very
&s;imple, and &s;o free from the lea&s;t Appearance of
<HI>Worldly Pomp,</HI> that he might be call'd the <HI>Model of
Humility.</HI> I'm a&s;&s;ur'd by &s;everal Per&s;ons of un|que&s;tion'd
Credit, that the Expence
of his Table was fix'd at<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>One</HI> Shilling.</NOTE> <HI>Two Julio's</HI>
a Day, and that the whole Charge
of his Provi&s;ions did not exceed <HI>Fifty Crowns</HI> a
Year. I cannot without A&s;toni&s;hment reflect on
the admirable Sobriety of a Per&s;on who might
be ju&s;tly rank'd among the mo&s;t Potent Princes
<PB N="110" REF="74">
in the World; and am not at all &s;urpriz'd that
mo&s;t Per&s;ons here e&s;teem him a Saint. 'Tis &s;aid
that <HI>Miracles</HI> are wrought at his Tomb; and if
that Report continue a while longer, he will cer|tainly
be the only Object of the People's Devo|tion.
I know not whether the Zeal of his Ado|rers
may not one Day procure the deceas'd Pope
a place among the <HI>Canoniz'd Saints:</HI> But con&s;i|dering
the Reputation of his <HI>Succe&s;&s;our,</HI> I may ven|ture
to a&s;&s;ure you, that he will never be enroll'd
among that Number.</P>
<P>Under this Pontificat the <HI>Curtezans</HI> have re&s;um'd
their expiring Courage, and begin to appear with the
&s;ame Haughtine&s;s and In&s;olency that &s;eem'd to
be in &s;ome Mea&s;ure curb'd under the Govern|ment
of <HI>Innocent</HI> XI. That Jovial Society, which
may be reckon'd a <HI>Fourth Order</HI> in the State, and
no le&s;s con&s;iderable than any of the re&s;t, will,
in all probability, maintain its Privileges and Li|berties
as long as the Supreme Power is lodg'd in
the <HI>Clergy,</HI> who will never deprive them&s;elves of
&s;o nece&s;&s;ary a <HI>Diver&s;ion.</HI> And truly, I know not
how &s;o many young Per&s;ons that are engag'd in
a Vow which they are not able to perform,
cou'd &s;ub&s;i&s;t, without the comfortable A&s;&s;i&s;tance
of tho&s;e <HI>Communicative Ladies.</HI> Hone&s;t <HI>Matrons</HI> are
daily affronted by tho&s;e domineering <HI>Strumpets,</HI>
who&s;e In&s;olence they mu&s;t &s;uffer patiently, &s;ince
'twou'd be in vain to contend with the <HI>Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es
of their Ma&s;ters.</HI> I'm not in the lea&s;t &s;urpriz'd at
their Haughtine&s;s and Pride; but I confe&s;s I
cou'd never have believ'd, without the Te&s;timo|ny
of my own Eyes, that they had &s;o much
Liberty, and &s;o little Shame. We had no &s;ooner
drop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d Anchor before <HI>Leghorn,</HI> but we were im|mediately
boarded by a Dozen of the&s;e <HI>Female
Pyrates,</HI> who, in &s;pite of the Captain, carry'd off
an equal Number of Prizes; for Mariners look
<PB N="111" REF="74">
upon this Port as a priviledg'd Place, where
they may ramble without controul. 'Tis true,
they find Plea&s;ure is not a cheap Commodity in
this place; for the&s;e Ladies are not &s;o Ho&s;pitable
as to entertain Travellers <HI>Gratis,</HI> and they u&s;ually
&s;et a very high price on their Favours, e&s;pecially
at <HI>Rome,</HI> which may be call'd the <HI>Centre of Whores.</HI>
I will not pretend to warrant the Truth of their
Opinion, who &s;ay, That at <HI>Rome</HI> Whores may &s;ue
a Man for their Hire: But I can a&s;&s;ure you, that
they may and do demand the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the
<HI>Corte,</HI> or Watch, who have Orders to protect 'em,
and &s;ee 'em paid, according to the Quality of the
Per&s;on. The <HI>Corte</HI> is a Band of <HI>Sbirri's,</HI> who walk
the Rounds every Night, to prevent Di&s;orders;
but their Authority is &s;o &s;mall, and the care they
take to &s;uppre&s;s Abu&s;es &s;o ineffectual, that I know
not whether the City receives any Benefit by 'em:
For &s;ince they are not permitted to Fire at any
Per&s;on, 'tis ea&s;ie for any Man that has the Ad|vantage
of a Nimble Pair of Heels, to avoid fal|ling
into their Clutches; and there are &s;ome roar|ing
Hectors, who not only make Head again&s;t
'em, but even keep 'em in Awe. I might reckon
up a Thou&s;and In&s;tances of &s;uch in&s;olent Vil|lanies;
but I &s;hall content my &s;elf with mention|ing
one that happen'd very lately: The City was
never plagu'd with a more de&s;perate Villain than
a certain <HI>Neapolitan</HI> Lord, call'd, <HI>The Prince de la
Matrice,</HI> who was Ring-leader of Fifty <HI>Bandits</HI> that
were fit Companions for &s;uch a Ma&s;ter: He and
his Gang made all the <HI>Sbirri's</HI> in <HI>Rome</HI> quake,
and continu'd their In&s;olences above a Year, till
at la&s;t the Pope having i&s;&s;u'd out an Order to
take him alive or dead, he took Sanctuary in a
Church, where he Capitulated with his Holine&s;s,
and was permitted to depart with Bag and Bag|gage,
he and all his Companions. 'Tis certainly
<PB N="112" REF="75">
a very great Abu&s;e, that Churches &s;hou'd &s;erve
as places of Retreat for Villains; and &s;o long as
the&s;e Privileges remain, the aboli&s;hing of the <HI>Fran|chi&s;es</HI>
will never put a Stop to the reigning Di&s;|orders.
But, which is &s;till more intolerable, the
Churches are not only &s;o many <HI>Sanctuaries</HI> to &s;e|cure
Malefactors from Puni&s;hment, but the <HI>Theatres</HI>
where they act their Villanies. The other Day,
when the People were met to hear <HI>Ve&s;per's</HI> at the
Church of S. <HI>Lewis,</HI> and were bu&s;ie at their De|votion,
Fifteen or Twenty Per&s;ons cry'd out on
a &s;udden, <HI>Fly, fly, the Church is falling;</HI> and imme|diately
run towards the Door, with &s;o many
&s;igns of Fear, that the People were almo&s;t per|&s;uaded
that the Church was tumbling about their
Ears. And &s;ince on &s;uch Occa&s;ions 'tis natu|ral
for a Man to think of &s;aving him&s;elf, before
he con&s;ider the greatne&s;s or probability of the
Danger, the People in the Church follow'd tho&s;e
whom they &s;aw running out, with &s;o much ha&s;te
and confu&s;ion, that &s;everal Per&s;ons were trodden
under Foot, and &s;o hurt that they were forc'd to
keep their Beds. In the mean time the Rogues
were not idle Spectatours of the Fright they had
occa&s;ion'd; and &s;ome began to mi&s;s their Pur&s;es,
and others their Silver-hilted Swords, a&s;&s;oon as
the Tumult was appeas'd, and the Cheat di&s;|cover'd.</P>
<P>During my abode at <HI>Rome,</HI> I had the fortune
to meet with the &s;ame <HI>Prie&s;t,</HI> who, as I told you
in one of my preceeding Letters, was impri&s;on'd
at <HI>Ma&s;con</HI> on &s;u&s;picion of <HI>Witchcraft:</HI> He makes
his Court to Cardinal <HI>Chigi,</HI> whom he &s;olicites ve|ry
earne&s;tly, and expects to obtain a Benefice from
him; but he is certainly an incorrigible Fool, as
you may perceive by the Account he gave me
of him&s;elf. He a&s;&s;ur'd me, that he entertain'd a
mo&s;t intimate Fellow&s;hip and Corre&s;pondence with
<PB N="113" REF="75">
certain imaginary Inhabitants of the <HI>Air,</HI> by
who&s;e A&s;&s;i&s;tance he pretends that one may ea&s;ily
&s;urmount all Difficulties, and wou'd have per&s;ua|ded
me, that the&s;e Spirits open'd the Doors of
the Pri&s;on when he was in danger of being con|demn'd
as a <HI>Sorcerer.</HI> I was &s;o &s;urpriz'd at the
Novelty and Oddne&s;s of his Opinion, that I re|&s;olv'd
to di&s;cour&s;e &s;eriou&s;ly with him about it,
and ask'd him how he came acquainted with
that Airy People, and why they wou'd not di&s;|cover
them&s;elves to the re&s;t of Mankind. He re|ply'd,
that they communicated their Favours only
to tho&s;e who are willing to hearken to 'em, and
to enter into a Society with 'em; adding, that
they have many Corre&s;pondents in the World
who live unknown, and conceal them&s;elves with
all po&s;&s;ible Care, to avoid the Fate of &s;o many
Hone&s;t Per&s;ons, that have been burnt alive for
Witchcraft in &s;everal places of the Kingdom.
He deny'd po&s;itively that there were any <HI>Witches,</HI>
&s;aying, That God was too Ju&s;t and Good to give
&s;o much Power to the Devil, who, according to
his Opinion, lies bound in Hell, from whence he
&s;hall never be releas'd. But I &s;oon perceiv'd that
there was as much Confu&s;ion in his Brain as in
his Di&s;cour&s;e, and that he was a meer <HI>Fanta&s;tical
Enthu&s;ia&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>I know not what Credit ye will give to this
Man's Relation concerning his imaginary Acquain|tances
in the Air; but you may firmly believe
the Story with which I am going to conclude my
Letter, &s;ince I was an Eye-witne&s;s of all that
pa&s;s'd. A certain <HI>Florentine</HI> Soldier in this City,
without pretending to be invulnerable, undertook
for a Wager of a Crown to &s;tand as a Mark
till four Bullets were &s;ucce&s;&s;ively &s;hot at him,
and perform'd his Undertaking without receiving
the lea&s;t hurt, tho' the Man who di&s;charg'd the
<PB N="114" REF="76">
Gun &s;tood but fifty Paces from him, and cou'd
neither be &s;u&s;pected of Collu&s;ion, nor want of
Skill, &s;ince all the four Bullets pierc'd the Door
again&s;t which the <HI>Florentin</HI> &s;tood. You will doubt|le&s;s
look upon this as a very odd and &s;urprizing
Accident: I was &s;o amaz'd at it, that I know
not whether I cou'd have believ'd it if I had not
&s;een it: Yet I can a&s;&s;ure you, that the <HI>Florentin</HI>
is no Magician, and that his Secret only con&s;i&s;ts
in &s;hifting his place a&s;&s;oon as he perceives the
fla&s;hing of the Powder: And the Account he
gave me of the ea&s;ine&s;s of his Undertaking, has
con&s;iderably le&s;&s;en'd my Surprizal at the Succe&s;s
of it: However, I wou'd not for 10000 Pi&s;tols
try the Experiment any otherwi&s;e than by &s;hoot|ing
a Bullet into the Sea. The Soldier found out
this way to give me &s;ome Satisfaction; and I
ob&s;erv'd that the Bullet remain'd &s;o long in the
Air, that a Man might ea&s;ily have avoided it.</P>
<P>Our Captain having taken in all his Lading,
expects only a fair Wind; and by good fortune,
the third part of the Cargo belongs to <HI>Malta;</HI>
&s;o that I &s;hall have the plea&s;ure of &s;pending at
the lea&s;t Fifteen Days in that celebrated I&s;land.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THo' I promis'd in my la&s;t to excu&s;e you
from &s;haring with us in the Inconveniencies
of the Sea, and to bring you from <HI>France</HI> to
<HI>Turkey,</HI> without meeting with one Storm; I can|not
forbear giving you account of one that over|took
us in the height of <HI>Sardinia.</HI> And I have
even the confidence to think that you will not
complain of my breach of Promi&s;e, &s;ince we had
all the <HI>Trouble,</HI> and you will only have the <HI>Plea|&s;ure;</HI>
if there be any truth in the common Ob|&s;ervation,
That Men u&s;ually take delight in hear|ing
a Relation of di&s;tant Misfortunes.</P>
<P>The plea&s;ure of our Voyage was not di&s;turb'd
for the fir&s;t two Days, tho' we made no great
Progre&s;s; but on the Third, about &s;even in the
Morning, there aro&s;e on the &s;udden a mo&s;t fu|rious
<HI>North-Ea&s;t</HI> Wind, which bur&s;t our Sails as if
they had been made of Paper; and between the
Wind on one &s;ide, and the <HI>South-We&s;t</HI> Surges on
the other, our Ship was &s;o violently to&s;s'd, that
our Mariners dur&s;t not &s;tir from the Sides of the
Ship, for fear of being wa&s;h'd off by the Waves.
Never was there any Object more capable of
&s;triking Terrour into the Spectatour; never any
Noi&s;e more frightful and amazing than that
which was occa&s;ion'd by the tumbling of the
Casks and Boxes, the Wind, Thunder, and Sea,
the cracking of the Ship, and the howling of
&s;ome Women that were on board. A horrid
Gloom turn'd the Day into Night, and was &s;uc|ceeded
by a Fla&s;h of Lightning that cover'd our
<PB N="116" REF="77">
Ship for above a Minute, and was accompany'd
with a terrible and &s;tupefying Crack. I know
not what we did in the mean time, nor was
there one among my Fellow-Pa&s;&s;engers that cou'd
inform me what was done in that dreadful Mi|nute:
For we were all &s;o &s;tunn'd, that there
were hardly any Signs of Life left in us. All
the Account I can give you is, that when we
recover'd our &s;en&s;es, we perceiv'd that the Light|ning
had left a thick and black Smoak, accompa|ny'd
with a &s;ulphureous and noi&s;om Stench, that
wou'd have kill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d us if it had la&s;ted a quarter of
an Hour; but it was di&s;&s;ipated in a Moment.
We found al&s;o that we were remov'd from the
places where we were when the Lightning fell;
which Change, doubtle&s;s, proceeded from the vio|lent
Motion and Agitation of the Ship. Among
the re&s;t, one of the Ship-Boys who lay &s;culking
in the Fore-Ca&s;tle, was thrown upon the Hatches
in the other end of the Ship, and &s;o bruis'd, and
black with Contu&s;ions, (tho' I may &s;ay more
properly, that there was only one Contu&s;ion,
which cover'd his whole Body) that we have
&s;till rea&s;on to doubt of his Recovery. The Ma|riners
concluded that the <HI>Devil</HI> was the Author
of all the&s;e Di&s;orders, and that there was &s;ome
Per&s;on in the Company under a Sentence of <HI>Ex|communication:</HI>
For (you know) extraordinary Ac|cidents
are u&s;ually e&s;teem'd <HI>Miracles</HI> by the &s;uper|&s;titious
Vulgar. 'Tis true, the throwing of
the Boy &s;o far may at the fir&s;t View &s;eem to be
above the Power of Nature; but an attentive Con|&s;iderer
will not be much &s;urpriz'd at this Effect
of the Tempe&s;t, &s;ince this is not the fir&s;t time
that a <HI>Hurricane</HI> has &s;natch'd up Men, and even whole
Ships. This puts me in mind of a Story almo&s;t
of the &s;ame Nature, which I heard at <HI>Guern&s;ey,</HI>
a little I&s;land, &s;ubject to the Crown of <HI>England.</HI>
<PB N="117" REF="77">
It happen'd one Day, that during a violent Storm,
a Fla&s;h of Lightning &s;et fire to the Powder in the
Ca&s;tle, and blew it up, with the whole Garri&s;on.
Only Ten or Twelve Per&s;ons e&s;cap'd, among whom
the Governour had the good fortune to be pre|&s;erv'd
in a very &s;ingular manner: They a&s;&s;ur'd
me that he was carry'd thro' the Air in his Bed,
and laid down upon the Ca&s;tle Wall, the Foot of
which is bath'd by the Sea; and that not know|ing
how to get down, becau&s;e the Wall was e|qually
&s;teep on both &s;ides, he remain'd there till
the Weather began to grow calm, and then made
&s;igns to the People of the Town, who came to
his A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>This furious Tempe&s;t was &s;ucceeded by pretty
fair Weather, which we enjoy'd during the re&s;t
of our Voyage to <HI>Malta,</HI> where we arriv'd &s;ix
Days after, and in nine Days from <HI>Leghorn;</HI> &s;o that
we made above a hundred Miles a Day, for
the di&s;tance betwixt the&s;e two Places amounts to
about a Thou&s;and Miles. We had no rea&s;on to
complain of the &s;lowne&s;s of our Pa&s;&s;age, tho 'we might
have perform'd the Voyage much &s;ooner if the Wind
had been con&s;tantly favourable: For the Captain
a&s;&s;ur'd me, that the <HI>Great Ma&s;ter</HI> of <HI>Malta,</HI> having
&s;ent an expre&s;s to <HI>Aix</HI> in <HI>Provence,</HI> the Ship on
which the Me&s;&s;enger embark'd, met with &s;o &s;trong
an <HI>Ea&s;terly</HI> Wind, that &s;he was carry'd nine hun|dred
Miles in three Days, and arriv'd at the Port
of <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> where finding another Ship ready to
&s;et &s;ail for <HI>Malta,</HI> he took Po&s;t for <HI>Aix,</HI> and ha|ving
di&s;patch'd his Bu&s;ine&s;s, return'd the &s;ame
Night to <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> where he embark'd in that Ve&s;|&s;el,
which immediately &s;et &s;ail with a mo&s;t fa|vourable
<HI>We&s;terly</HI> Gale, and in three Days arriv'd
at <HI>Malta:</HI> So that in Seven Days he perform'd a
Voyage of eighteen hundred Miles, travell'd ten
Leagues by Land, and di&s;patch'd his Affairs. I
<PB N="118" REF="78">
mu&s;t confe&s;s few Travellers are &s;o fortunate;
but that which happens <HI>rarely</HI> may happen <HI>&s;ome|times.</HI></P>
<P>This I&s;land was of old call'd <HI>Melita;</HI> and its pre|&s;ent
Name is an Abbreviation or Corruption of
the former: It lies in the thirty fourth Degree of
<HI>North</HI> Latitude, being &s;eventy Miles in compa&s;s,
twenty five long, and ten broad. Under the Reign
of <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> and long before, 'twas govern'd by its
own Kings, from whom it was taken by the
<HI>Saracens,</HI> who afterwards lo&s;t it to the <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI>
In the Year 1530, <HI>Charles</HI> V. erected it into a So|vereignty,
which he be&s;tow'd on the Knights of
S. <HI>John,</HI> who eight Years before were driven out
of <HI>Rhodes</HI> by the <HI>Turks,</HI> and had till then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rov'd
as <HI>Pyrates</HI> upon the Sea. The Conditions of the
Donation were, That the Nomination of the Bi|&s;hop
&s;hou'd belong to him; That the Knights
&s;hou'd pre&s;ent him Yearly with a <HI>Falcon,</HI> as a
Mark of Homage; and that they &s;hou'd not re|ceive
into their Ports any Ships or Ve&s;&s;els at En|mity
with the Crown of <HI>Spain,</HI> which they pun|ctually
ob&s;erve to this Day. But the <HI>Spaniard</HI>
has no rea&s;on to boa&s;t of this Cu&s;tom as a pe|culiar
Mark of Honour or Acknowledgment, &s;ince
his Ships meet with the &s;ame Treatment with tho&s;e
of other Princes, and are never admitted into the
Harbours of this I&s;land. I'm &s;o loth to &s;end you
an imperfect Account of this Place, that I can|not
forbear taking notice of the famous Siege which
it &s;uffer'd <HI>Ann.</HI> 1565. tho' I cannot rea&s;onably &s;up|po&s;e
you to be ignorant of a Tran&s;action that made
&s;o great a Noi&s;e in the World. <HI>Sultan Solyman,</HI> re|&s;olving
to extirpate the whole Order, &s;ent a for|midable
Army again&s;t 'em, under the command
of <HI>Sinan Ba&s;&s;a,</HI> who po&s;&s;e&s;s'd him&s;elf of the I&s;land,
burnt the Villages, made the Inhabitants Slaves,
and de&s;troy'd the whole Country with Fire and
<PB N="119" REF="78">
Sword. But the Ca&s;tle of S. <HI>Angelo</HI> put a Stop to
his Fury, and re&s;i&s;ted all his Attacks, till upon the
News of the approach of the powerful Aids &s;ent
by the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Princes, he was forc'd to make a
di&s;orderly Retreat, leaving two great pieces of Can|non,
one of which lies at the bottom of the Wa|ter
in the Port; and the other under the Baraque
of <HI>Italy,</HI> commonly call d, <HI>The great Ba&s;ilisk,</HI> and
carrying 120 pound Ball. The next Year the
<HI>Great Ma&s;ter, de la Valette,</HI> laid the Foundation of
the New City, and call'd it by his own Name.
I may venture to &s;ay, without an Hyperbole, that
this is the &s;tronge&s;t City in the World: I never
&s;aw &s;o many, nor better contriv'd Works; and
be&s;ides, the Strength of the Place is very con&s;ide|rably
augmented by the Advantages of its Situa|tion;
for all the <HI>Half-Moons</HI> and <HI>Ba&s;tions</HI> are cut
out of the Rock, as well as the <HI>Counter&s;carp</HI> that de|fends
'em; and the Ditches, which in &s;ome places
are &s;ixty Foot deep, and proportionably broad.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;tle of S. <HI>Angelo</HI> is in the Old City,
which is &s;eparated from the other by a double
Port, con&s;i&s;ting of two Harbours, divided by a
Neck of Land, which have but one Mouth. At
the end of this <HI>I&s;thmus</HI> &s;tands the Ca&s;tle of S. <HI>Elm,</HI>
defending the Entry of both Ports, in one of
which the Ships that arrive are oblig'd to perform
their <HI>Quarantain,</HI> having the conveniency of a lit|tle
I&s;land, which &s;erves as a <HI>Lazaretto</HI> for the Pa&s;&s;en|gers
and their Goods. On the other &s;ide is the great
Harbour, frequented by tho&s;e who are permitted
to conver&s;e with the Inhabitants. Both the&s;e Har|bours
are &s;afe and convenient; but the Entry is
extremely dangerous, by rea&s;on of the Rocks that
lie hid under the Water.</P>
<P>The New City, call'd <HI>Valette,</HI> is &s;eated partly
on the Top, and partly on the Declivity of a
ri&s;ing Ground, de&s;cending to the Shoar. The
<PB N="120" REF="79">
Streets are &s;treight, running in parallel Lines both
thro' the Length and Breadth of the City, and
are &s;o contriv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d, that the A&s;cent is only di&s;cerna|ble
in four or five, the re&s;t being exactly level.
The Hou&s;es are generally fair, built after the <HI>Itali|an</HI>
Fa&s;hion, with Platforms on the Top; &s;o that
the Sketch of the New City re&s;embles perfectly a
<HI>Rectilinear Amphitheatre.</HI> The Old City is not &s;o
beautiful, and is at pre&s;ent only inhabited by the
Common People; yet 'tis the Seat of the Bi&s;hop
and his Chapter, which may vie with any So|ciety
of that Nature in <HI>Italy,</HI> being compos'd of
four and twenty Canons, who wear the Epi&s;co|pal
Habit, and have each a Thou&s;and Crowns a
Year.</P>
<P>There is but one publick Place or <HI>Square</HI> in the City
<HI>Valette,</HI> which is con&s;iderable for its Beauty, adorn'd
with a Fountain in the middle, the Water of
which falling into a Basket of Stone &s;o artificially
cut, that it &s;eems to be tran&s;parent, makes one of
the plea&s;ante&s;t Ca&s;cades in the World. The Front
of the Great Ma&s;ter's Palace makes one intire &s;ide
of the Square. There is nothing admirable either
in the In&s;ide or Out&s;ide of this Structure; 'tis of
a Square Figure, and &s;eparated from the Neigh|bouring
Buildings by four Streets. 'Tis divided into
the <HI>Winter</HI> and <HI>Summer</HI> Apartments: The fir&s;t, which
is the mo&s;t ancient and lea&s;t beautiful, is painted
throughout with the Repre&s;entations of Victories ob|tain'd
over the <HI>Turks,</HI> and particularly the rai&s;ing of
the Siege of <HI>Malta,</HI> accompany'd with Explanatory
In&s;criptions. The <HI>Summer</HI> Apartment was built
by the late Great Ma&s;ter, <HI>Vignacourt,</HI> who beauti|fy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d
<HI>Malta</HI> with &s;o many Ornaments, and wou'd
have certainly made this a very Magnificent Pa|lace,
if Death had not interrupted his De&s;igns.
That which is chiefly remarkable in it is the <HI>Hall
of Arms,</HI> where there are 30000 Muskets, as many
<PB N="121" REF="79">
Bandaliers, 10000 Cuira&s;&s;es and Helmets, with a
proportionable Number of Swords, Pikes, Pi&s;tols,
and Scimitars, all rank'd in the fine&s;t Order ima|ginable.
There is an incredible number of ca&s;t Pieces
of Cannon in this City; for tho' I never reckon'd
'em my &s;elf, I'm a&s;&s;ur'd by Per&s;ons of unque&s;ti|on'd
Credit, that there are 1060, and all of a con|&s;iderable
bigne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Churches of <HI>Malta</HI> are incomparably beau|tiful,
the <HI>Italian</HI> Neatne&s;s reigns throughout, and
they are every where adorn'd with Painting and
Gilding. The principal Church is dedicated to
S. <HI>John Bapti&s;t,</HI> the Patron of the Order: The Pro|&s;pect
of it is not very plea&s;ant; but to make a|mends
for the Defects of the Out&s;ide, I never &s;aw
any thing that cou'd with Ju&s;tice be compar'd to
the Richne&s;s and Beauty of the In&s;ide. 'Tis as
light as an open Field, and all its Ornaments ap|pear
with &s;o unclouded a Lu&s;tre, and &s;o charm
the Eye of the Spectatour, that I believe never
any Man came out of it without Reluctancy.
'Tis pav'd throughout with large pieces of black
and white Marble: The Walls and Columns are
lin'd to the very Cornices, with curious Wain|&s;cotting,
which hardly ob&s;tructs the Sight; and
the <HI>Life of S. John</HI> is painted <HI>in Fre&s;co,</HI> on the Vault,
by the Hand of the <HI>Chevalier Mathias.</HI> But the fi|ne&s;t
Work of that Nature in the Church is the
<HI>beheading of the Holy Bapti&s;t,</HI> repre&s;ented in a Cha|pel
of the &s;ame Name, by the Hand of <HI>Michael
Angelo;</HI> this Picture was pre&s;ented to the Order
by one of the Dukes of <HI>Florence,</HI> and may be rec|kon'd
a very con&s;iderable Complement, &s;ince the
Princes of that Family are &s;eldom wont to part
with &s;uch rare and beautiful Pieces.</P>
<P>The many and magnificent <HI>Epitaphs</HI> of the
<HI>Great Ma&s;ters,</HI> and <HI>Grand Cro&s;&s;es,</HI> with their Scutche|ons,
are none of the lea&s;t remarkable Ornaments
<PB N="122" REF="80">
of this Church; and among the re&s;t, the <HI>Great
Ma&s;ter Vignacourt</HI>'s <HI>Epitaph</HI> is extremely beauti|ful.</P>
<P>Every one of the <HI>Seven Languages</HI> has a peculiar
Chapel in this Church, which they &s;trive to adorn
in Emulation of one another. There is not a
Church in the World where Ve&s;&s;els of Gold and
Silver are more common than in this. Among o|ther
curious Works, there are two <HI>Angels</HI> of the
la&s;t of the&s;e Metals, as big as the Life: But the
mo&s;t fini&s;h'd Piece is a golden <HI>Sun</HI> of <HI>Filagram</HI>-Work,
to receive the <HI>Holy Sacrament,</HI> of which the
Workman&s;hip alone co&s;t 2000 Crowns. The Trea|&s;ury
is &s;o full of <HI>Relicks,</HI> that 'twou'd be an end|le&s;s
Labour to de&s;cribe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">em; and therefore I &s;hall
only tell you, that the fine&s;t Piece I &s;aw in it is
the <HI>Bi&s;hop's Mitre,</HI> &s;et all over with the riche&s;t
Jewels.</P>
<P>The <HI>Great Altar</HI> in the Nave is e&s;teem'd one of
the mo&s;t magnificent Works of that Nature in
<HI>Europe:</HI> It &s;tands by it &s;elf, after the Modern Fa|&s;hion,
like that of <HI>Strasburg,</HI> which it exceeds both
in Largene&s;s and Richne&s;s. I &s;aw the <HI>Grand Prior</HI>
of the Order &s;ay Ma&s;s here in Ceremony, and
after the &s;ame manner as the Pope does at <HI>Rome.</HI>
His Habit is not different from that of a Bi&s;hop;
but he is &s;erv'd by eight Deacons and Sub-Dea|cons,
with a great deal of State and Ceremony.
The place where he &s;its while the Epi&s;tles and
Go&s;pels are read, is on the Right-hand as you go to
the Altar, and directly oppo&s;ite to the <HI>Great Ma|&s;ter,</HI>
who &s;its in an arm'd Chair on the Left|hand,
unde a Canopy, two Pages &s;tanding be|hind
to &s;erve him. The <HI>Grand Cro&s;&s;es</HI> are &s;eated
in the middle of the Nave, on a double Row of
Benches, with Rails or Backs, which enclo&s;e the
place. The <HI>Bailiffs</HI> and <HI>Commanders</HI> are plac'd on
the Seats behind; and the re&s;t of the Knights &s;it
<PB N="123" REF="80">
either in the Chapels belonging to their Language,
or in any other part of the Church. To return
to their manner of Officiating; I ob&s;erv'd two
Ceremonies I had never &s;een before, &s;ince they
are Marks of Re&s;pect that are only &s;how'd to the
Pope: For there are two Clerks who fan the
Grand Prior's Head and Face all the while he &s;ays
Ma&s;s, with two large Fans of O&s;tridge Feathers;
and after he has done, he &s;its down in his Chair,
and the &s;ame Clerks coming in their Surplices,
undre&s;s him from Head to Foot, pulling off even
his Slippers. The <HI>Prior</HI> is one of the mo&s;t con&s;i|derable
Officers of the Order, and is rank'd be|fore
the <HI>Grand Cro&s;&s;es,</HI> and immediately after the
<HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> and <HI>Great Ma&s;ter,</HI> who only preceed him,
tho' he is not cho&s;en out of the Cla&s;&s;is of <HI>Noble
Knights.</HI> The pre&s;ent Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;our of this Dignity
is a Native of <HI>Aix</HI> in <HI>Provence,</HI> and is a Per&s;on
of Merit, tho' of mean Birth.</P>
<P>Since I have in&s;en&s;ibly enter'd upon this Sub|ject,
I &s;hall take this occa&s;ion to acquaint you
with the various Degrees and Dignities of the&s;e
Knights; but you mu&s;t only expect a general
<HI>Idea</HI> of the Order, and I believe you de&s;ire no
more.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual Title of the&s;e Knights is of no older
date than their Settlement in this I&s;land; for ac|cording
to their In&s;titution they ought to be call'd
<HI>Knights of S. John of Jeru&s;alem.</HI> The De&s;ign of
the Foundation was for <HI>Ho&s;pitality,</HI> and for the
Relief and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the poor Pilgrims who
came from all the parts of the World to vi&s;it the
<HI>Holy Places.</HI> At fir&s;t the Order was compos'd of
Per&s;ons of mean Rank or Quality, living under a
Superiour, call'd <HI>Gerard,</HI> a <HI>Frenchman</HI> by birth, who
had built a Ho&s;pital in the &s;ame Place where they
pretend <HI>Zacharias</HI> us'd to perform his Devotions,
and dedicated it to S. <HI>John Bapti&s;t.</HI> This <HI>Gerard,</HI>
<PB N="124" REF="81">
who may be reckon'd the Founder of the Order,
was a Man of a very Holy Life, and &s;pent his
time in doing all the Offices of Ho&s;pitality, ac|cording
to his Profe&s;&s;ion. 'Tis &s;aid, that he car|ry'd
Bread every Night to the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Army,
when <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> was be&s;ieg'd by <HI>Godfrey</HI> of <HI>Bouillon;</HI>
and that being &s;u&s;pected, he was narrowly ob|&s;erv'd,
and at la&s;t &s;urpriz'd in the very act. Im|mediately
he was &s;eiz'd, and carry'd before the
Governour, with a Burthen of Loaves, which
were miraculou&s;ly chang'd into Stones when his
Accu&s;ers began to take 'em out of the Bag; &s;o
that he was fully acquitted.</P>
<P>Sometime after, <HI>Godfrey</HI> having taken the Town,
was not unmindful of his Benefactour; he care&s;s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d

Rectors &s;hou'd be elected by the Members of the
Society. By Virtue of this Bull, they made choice
of one <HI>Roger</HI> for their &s;econd <HI>Rector,</HI> whom they
afterwards honour'd with the Title of <HI>Ma&s;ter:</HI>
'I was he who contriv'd and e&s;tabli&s;h d the Sta|tutes

and has two Sleeves ending in a Point, which are

Writings at <HI>Malta.</HI></P>
<P>On the Day of their Profe&s;&s;ion, they mu&s;t bran|di&s;h
a Sword thrice, as it were to defie the Ene|mies
of the Name of <HI>Chri&s;t:</HI> Afterwards they take
the Vows of <HI>Poverty, Cha&s;tity,</HI> and <HI>Obedience.</HI> In
performance of the <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> they live in the Inns of
their re&s;pective Languages, enjoying all things in
Common, and the Order inherits their E&s;tates:
The <HI>Second</HI> hinders 'em from Marrying; and the
<HI>Third</HI> obliges 'em to come to <HI>Malta</HI> as often as
their Appearance is requir'd by the <HI>Great Ma&s;ter,</HI>
and to obey all his Orders by Virtue of their Ho|ly
Obedience. Thus they content them&s;elves with
a &s;eeming Performance of the&s;e Vows, but their
Practice is not in the lea&s;t an&s;werable to their
Profe&s;&s;ion: For, in the fir&s;t place, their <HI>Poverty</HI>
wou'd &s;atisfie my large&s;t De&s;ires, &s;ince mo&s;t of 'em
receive con&s;iderable Pen&s;ions from their Relations,
be&s;ides Eighty Crowns a Year from their re&s;pective
Inns, which may be reckon'd a very comfortable
Maintenance. Nor are they more religious Ob|&s;ervers
of their Second Vow; they are ju&s;t as
<HI>Cha&s;t</HI> as my &s;elf, and I know not what they can
pretend to enjoy in Common but <HI>Women,</HI> whom
they have &s;o well accu&s;tom'd to that way of li|ving,
that a Faithful Wife is a very &s;carce Com|modity
<PB N="126" REF="82">
in <HI>Malta.</HI> And as for the la&s;t Vow, if
<HI>Obedience</HI> con&s;i&s;t in Grimaces, they are certainly the
mo&s;t Obedient Gentlemen in the World; but if,
for Example, the <HI>Great Ma&s;ter</HI> &s;hou'd take a Fancy
to recall the <HI>Chevalier de Noailles,</HI> I que&s;tion very
much whether he wou'd obey the Summons. To
conclude, I cannot give you a ju&s;ter Character
of 'em, than in their own Words; They are on|ly
<HI>Poor</HI> when a Curte&s;an demands her Fees; <HI>Obe|dient</HI>
at Table, where they are always invited to
Eat and Drink heartily; and <HI>Cha&s;t</HI> at Church,
which is their greate&s;t Penance.</P>
<P>The Order is compos'd of <HI>four</HI> different <HI>Cla&s;&s;es;</HI>
or rather there is only one, which tolerates the
re&s;t out of Charity. The fir&s;t is that of the <HI>No|ble
Knights,</HI> who before their Admi&s;&s;ion mu&s;t
prove their Nobility in the pre&s;ence of certain
Commi&s;&s;ioners, who are &s;ent to examine their Pe|digree
upon the Place. They wear a Cro&s;s of
Gold enamell'd, hanging at one of their Button-Holes,

The Second is the Cla&s;s of <HI>Prie&s;ts,</HI> who for the

fir&s;t. The Third is that of the <HI>Serving Knights,</HI>

whom he grants that Favour, which brings 'em
no other Advantage than the u&s;ual Salary of
four&s;core Crowns; and their Cro&s;s is like that
of the <HI>Serving Knights.</HI> Of all the Four <HI>Cla&s;&s;es,</HI>
the fir&s;t only can a&s;pire to the Dignities of the
Order, that is, to the Title and Office of <HI>Comman|ders,
Grand Cro&s;&s;es,</HI> and <HI>Great Ma&s;ter.</HI> The two fir&s;t
are given in Order, according to their Seniority;

is preferr'd before all the <HI>Grand Cro&s;&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Grand Cro&s;&s;es</HI> are &s;o call'd from a large
Cro&s;s of white Sattin, that covers their whole
Brea&s;t, from their fir&s;t Button-Hole to the Belly.
'Tis &s;ew'd upon a kind of Sleevele&s;s Ve&s;t, meet|ing
on the &s;ide, which in Winter is made of black
Cloth, and in Summer of Silk. All the re&s;t of
the Knights wear a red Ve&s;t of the &s;ame Fa&s;hion
when they go to War, but the Cro&s;s is white, and
of the &s;ame Figure with that which they wear at
their Button-Holes; but the Cro&s;s of the <HI>Serving
Knights</HI> is of a Circular Figure.</P>
<P>All the Employments and Offices of Honour
and Profit are at the Di&s;po&s;al of the <HI>Great Ma&s;ter,</HI>
who is oblig'd to chu&s;e one of the <HI>Nobles:</HI> But
there are few even of that <HI>Cla&s;&s;is</HI> who dare a&s;pire
to the Dignity of <HI>Captain of the Galleys,</HI> by rea&s;on
of the va&s;t Charge that attends it, &s;ince the Or|der
only allows him a Set of Plate, which he mu&s;t re|&s;tore
when he quits that Employment. But to
make amends for that Inconveniency, the Captains
of the Galleys are &s;oon after promoted to a <HI>Com|mandery;</HI>
for tho' I told you that the&s;e Places are
u&s;ually given to the Senior Knights, yet there are
a con&s;iderable Number of 'em at the <HI>Great Ma&s;ter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI>
di&s;po&s;al, who be&s;tows 'em on his Favourites. The&s;e

exclude not the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of 'em from enjoying
the Commanderies that fall to 'em by right of Se|niority:
And be&s;ides, there are certain particular
Offices belonging to each <HI>Language,</HI> &s;uch as that
of <HI>Trea&s;urer, Ma&s;ter of the Artillery,</HI> &amp;c. The Three
Sovereign Juri&s;dictions of <HI>Malta</HI> belong to the

each of three Members. Be&s;ides, the <HI>Great
Ma&s;ter</HI> chu&s;es every Year a <HI>Captain</HI> of the <HI>Verga,</HI>
who mu&s;t be a Native of <HI>Malta,</HI> and con&s;equent|ly
no Knight: His Office is to admini&s;ter Ju&s;tice
to the Inhabitants of the City and Country. This
right of <HI>Seniority</HI> which gives a Title to the Of|fices
of <HI>Commanders</HI> and <HI>Grand Cro&s;&s;es,</HI> is a great
Mortification to tho&s;e who are not made Knights
in their Youth: And therefore they who de&s;ign
to obtain that Dignity for their Children, procure
'em to be receiv'd into the Order as &s;oon as
they are born, that they may not wait too long
for Preferrment. In the mean time, tho&s;e who
have no E&s;tates live in their re&s;pective Inns, of
which every <HI>Language</HI> has one. The Seven <HI>Lan|guages</HI>
are tho&s;e of <HI>Provence, Auvergne, France, Italy,
Arragon, Germany,</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;tile.</HI> Over every <HI>Language</HI>
there is a <HI>Grand Cro&s;s,</HI> to whom the Order allows
eighty Crowns for each Man.</P>
<P>The Members of the Second <HI>Cla&s;s</HI> &s;erve at the
Altar, and are only capable of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Pre|ferment:
Thus they may obtain the Offices of
<HI>Vicars, Canons,</HI> and <HI>Grand Prior,</HI> which is the
highe&s;t Dignity within the reach of their Am|bition.</P>
<P>The <HI>Serving Knights</HI> are incapable of being pro|moted
to the Dignity of a <HI>Grand Cro&s;s,</HI> or of
enjoying a <HI>Commandery</HI> by right of Seniority; but
they may po&s;&s;e&s;s <HI>Commanderies of Grace,</HI> which the
<HI>Great Ma&s;ter</HI> &s;ometimes be&s;tows on 'em, either as a
particular Mark of his Kindne&s;s, or as a Reward of
their Valour. They may rigg out <HI>Privateers</HI> under
the Banner of the Order; but none of this <HI>Cla&s;&s;is</HI>
can be made <HI>Captain of the Galleys,</HI> &s;ince the <HI>Noble
Knights</HI> wou'd not &s;ubmit to his Authority.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="83">
As for the <HI>Great Ma&s;ter's Knights,</HI> who compo&s;e
the Fourth <HI>Cla&s;s,</HI> they receive no other Honour or
Advantage by their Admi&s;&s;ion into the Order,
but a Salary of Eighty Crowns a Year, and the
Title of <HI>Knights of S. John.</HI></P>
<P>To the&s;e Four <HI>Cla&s;&s;es</HI> I might add a Fifth, I
mean the <HI>Knights of the Holy Sepulchre,</HI> who wear a
Cro&s;s of Gold <HI>Potency;</HI> but &s;ince they are not ac|knowledg'd
by the <HI>Knights of Malta,</HI> and have no
other Patents than what they receive from the
<HI>Fathers Ob&s;ervants,</HI> who are at pre&s;ent Guardians of
the Sepulchre, I will not trouble you with a far|ther
Account of 'em.</P>
<P>Having given you a general <HI>Idea</HI> of the Four
<HI>Cla&s;&s;es,</HI> and of all the inferiour Offices, I &s;hall in
the next place proceed to con&s;ider the Supreme
Dignity of the Order. The <HI>Great, Ma&s;ter</HI> is very
careful to pre&s;erve the Re&s;pect due to his Chara|cter,
and &s;eldom Conver&s;es familiarly with the
<HI>Knights,</HI> nor even with the <HI>Grand Cro&s;&s;es.</HI> When
he goes to Church, all the Knights whom he
meets in the <HI>Square,</HI> and by the Way, join in his
Train; and when he returns they make a dou|ble
File, thro' which he pa&s;&s;es. All the Officers of
his Hou&s;hold are <HI>Noble Knights,</HI> even the very Pages,
of whom he entertains twenty four. His princi|pal
Officers are the <HI>Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e,</HI> the <HI>Major
Domo,</HI> and the <HI>High Chamberlain.</HI> The pre&s;ent <HI>Great
Ma&s;ter</HI> is de&s;cended from the Illu&s;trious Hou&s;e of
<HI>Caraffa:</HI> He is a large and thick Man, of a good
Mien, but very old: He keeps a Table for a hundred
Knights, whom he chu&s;es to be partakers of his
Bounty, and who by that means may &s;ave the
Pen&s;ion they receive from the Order.</P>
<P>The Habits of the Knights are very different
at <HI>Malta:</HI> The <HI>French, Italians,</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> re|taining
the Modes of their re&s;pective Nations.
The Garb of the la&s;t is &s;o odd, that I cannot for|bear
<PB N="130" REF="84">
giving you &s;ome Account of it: They wear
a Doublet &s;lit before and behind, and the Sleeves
are al&s;o &s;lit, and clo&s;e at the Wri&s;ts; an old-fa|&s;hion'd
Collar, narrow Breeches fa&s;ten'd with But|tons;
and, in a Word, I cou'd not chu&s;e a more
Comical Habit if I were going to act the <HI>Spani|ard</HI>
in a Mask. The <HI>Italians</HI> are dre&s;s'd exactly
like &s;o many <HI>Scaramouchi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s.</HI></P>
<P>The Order takes care to pre&s;erve &s;ome exter|nal
Marks of Ho&s;pitality, which, as I told you,
was the De&s;ign of their In&s;titution: They keep a
Magnificent Ho&s;pital, endow'd with a Revenue of
50000 Livres. The Commandery of it belongs to
the <HI>French Language,</HI> and is one of the principal
Offices of the Order: The Magnificence of the
Structure does not appear on the Out&s;ide, but the
Apartments are very fine. There are five Halls,
capable of containing four hundred &s;ick Per&s;ons,
who are &s;erv'd by the Knights when they Eat or
Drink, the Servants of the Ho&s;pital taking care of
the re&s;t. The Ve&s;&s;els are generally of Silver; the
Beds are good, and the Linen is chang'd pretty
often. And be&s;ides, the di&s;eas'd are &s;o plentiful|ly
furni&s;h'd with all things that are proper for
their Entertainment and Cure, that the Knights
them&s;elves &s;cruple not to lodge here when they are
&s;ick. 'Tis true, they are not laid in the &s;ame
Rooms with &s;o many dead and dying Per&s;ons,
who&s;e Company alone wou'd infect the &s;ounde&s;t
Man in the World with their Di&s;tempers: For
they lie in &s;eparate Halls, and are &s;erv'd apart.
<HI>Catholicks</HI> of all Nations, without exception, are
receiv'd into the Ho&s;pital; but the&s;e Acts of Cha|rity
are not very Chargeable to the Order,
&s;ince their Gue&s;ts are &s;eldom very Numerous.</P>
<P>The&s;e few Ob&s;ervations may &s;uffice to give you
an <HI>Idea</HI> of the Order of <HI>Malta.</HI> My next &s;hall
contain an Account of the I&s;land in general, and
<PB N="131" REF="84">
of the Manners and Cu&s;toms of its Inhabitants:

<P><HI>MAlta</HI> is &s;o low an I&s;land that 'tis &s;carce di&s;|cernible
above twenty Miles off at Sea, even
in the cleare&s;t Weather; &s;o that many Ships pa&s;s
by without perceiving it. There are no Woods in
it by rea&s;on of the &s;hallowne&s;s of the Ground;
for the whole I&s;land is only a dry Rock, which,
with much ado, may be made to produce &s;ome|thing.
And the &s;carcity of Earth makes it &s;o
precious, that if a Man were found &s;tealing it out
of his Neighbours Grounds, he wou'd be puni&s;h'd
with the utmo&s;t Severity. The only Trees that
grow there are <HI>Oranges, Citrons, Apricocks, Peaches,</HI>
and <HI>Pomgranates,</HI> which require no great depth of
Earth; and even the&s;e grow only in certain parts
of the I&s;land, the re&s;t being planted with Vines,
which bear a very delicious Grape: There are al|&s;o
<HI>Strawberries, Pa&s;taiques,</HI> and excellent <HI>Figs,</HI> and
a prodigious quantity of the be&s;t <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> in the
World, which we eat as often as we plea&s;e:
They are almo&s;t all white, but &s;weet as Sugar,
and melt in the Mouth. The <HI>Pa&s;taique</HI> is a Fruit
very much re&s;embling a Citrul, but not quite &s;o
big. 'Tis eaten raw like a Melon, and melts in the
<PB N="132" REF="85">
Mouth. Tho' it be expos'd a whole Day to the
Sun-Beams, it remains as fre&s;h as if it had been
kept in Snow. There are two &s;orts of it, one
red, and the other white: The fir&s;t is the be&s;t; but
the Buyer mu&s;t take 'em at a venture, as well as
Melons. 'Tis the u&s;ual Cu&s;tom when five or
&s;ix Citizens meet on the publick Place, to open
a Score of 'em, and tho&s;e who have the fortune
to meet with none but white ones, are oblig'd
to pay for the re&s;t; which they call playing at
<HI>Pa&s;taiques.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Malta</HI> is hotter than <HI>Rome,</HI> or any other place
in <HI>Europe;</HI> and the &s;tifling Heat of the Climate is
&s;o much the more in&s;upportable, becau&s;e there are
no cool Breezes to temper it; and the Brow of
the Hill is expos'd directly to the <HI>South.</HI> The
Pea&s;ants are as black as <HI>Egyptians;</HI> for they take
no care to pre&s;erve them&s;elves from the Sun;
and the mo&s;t &s;corching Heat is not able to drive
'em into their Hou&s;es, or even make 'em leave
off working. This is an evident Demon&s;tration
of the Power of Nature in performing things
that &s;eem to be impo&s;&s;ible: For there are few
things which a Man may not &s;uffer if he be ac|cu&s;tom'd
to 'em from his Infancy, as the <HI>Mal|te&s;e</HI>
are in this ca&s;e, who inure the Bodies of
their Children to Heat, by making 'em go &s;tark
naked, without Shirt, Drawers, or Cap, as &s;oon
as they are taken from their Mother s Brea&s;t, to
the Age of Ten Years; &s;o that their Skin grows
as hard as Leather. You will ea&s;ily perceive that
I &s;peak of the Pea&s;ants, and Meaner &s;ort of the
Inhabitants; for all the re&s;t cloath their Chil|dren
as they do in other Countries: Only to pre|&s;erve
them&s;elves from the Heat, they never go a|broad
during the hotte&s;t part of the Day; and
be&s;ides, they cloath them&s;elves very &s;lightly, and
&s;leep from Noon till four a-clock. The richer

much in fa&s;hion among Per&s;ons of Quality in
<HI>Italy,</HI> I mean certain Machines hung at the Ceil|ing,
about three Foot broad and u&s;ually made of
&s;ome Silk Stuff, &s;tretch<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">d upon &s;mall and very
thin Laths, &s;urrounded with O&s;trich-Feathers.
There is al&s;o a &s;mall &s;ilken Cord fa&s;ten'd to it,
and drawn thro' a Hole into the Anti-chamber,
where a Servant is plac'd to keep the Machine
playing by pulling the Cord. The&s;e Fans are u|&s;ually
hung over a Couch, or Bed of Repo&s;e,
where a Man may lie and enjoy the Plea&s;ure of Fan|ning
as long as he plea&s;es: And &s;ometimes one
of 'em is plac'd on the Table, both for Coolne&s;s,
and to drive away the Flies. If you con&s;ider al|&s;o
the <HI>Sorbet, Straw-berries, Ra&s;pherries,</HI> and all the
<HI>cooling Waters</HI> us'd in <HI>Italy,</HI> you will not blame me
for affirming that a Rich Man may live com|fortably
in any Climate, and ea&s;ily avoid all the
Inconveniencies of exce&s;&s;ive Heat or Cold. I
need not go farther than <HI>Malta</HI> for a convincing
Proof of this A&s;&s;ertion; &s;ince the violent Heat
that reigns here &s;erves only to encrea&s;e
the Plea&s;ure of being fann'd, and of drinking
cold Liquors, with which this I&s;land is always
furni&s;h d, tho' the Winter produces neither Snow
nor Ice: For the <HI>Great Ma&s;ter</HI> takes care to &s;up|ply
that defect, by letting out the Sale of the&s;e
Commodities by way of Farm, to a Man, who
&s;ends every Winter to <HI>Sicily</HI> for a &s;ufficient quan|tity
to fill the Ice-Hou&s;es, and is oblig d to fur|ni&s;h
the I&s;land all the Summer, under pain of
paying a Fine of Ten Crowns a Day, in ca&s;e
of failure.</P>
<P>The I&s;land of <HI>Malta</HI> is very populous, and rec|kon'd
to contain 15000 Men, who are all divi|ded
into Companies. They are oblig'd to wear
Swords, but forbidden to draw 'em under &s;uch ri|gorous
<PB N="134" REF="86">
Penalties, that the natural Malice of the
Inhabitants is very effectually curb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d by their Fear
of Puni&s;hment: Yet they &s;ometimes venture to
execute their Fury with a little Poniard or <HI>Stiletto,</HI>
after the <HI>Italian</HI> fa&s;hion. I cannot better expre&s;s the
barbarity of their Temper and Inclinations, than by
telling you, that their Humour is not different
from that of the <HI>Sicilians,</HI> that, like them, they
are Treacherous and Bloody, Jealous even to Mad|ne&s;s,
and capable of attempting the mo&s;t horrid
Villanies when they are animated by that cruel
Pa&s;&s;ion. To convince you of the Ju&s;tne&s;s of this
Character, 'twill be &s;ufficient to relate two Acci|dents
that happen'd very lately; for the two Prin|ciple
Actors are &s;till alive, and remain in the
Churches of St. <HI>Lewis</HI> and St. <HI>John,</HI> whither
they f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, to avoid the ju&s;t Puni&s;hment of their
Crimes.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t had a young, hand&s;om, and loving
Wife, yet (according to the Cu&s;tom of all his
Countrymen, both Batchelors and marry'd Men,)
he kept a Whore, who po&s;&s;e&s;s'd his Heart and
Soul, and was &s;o ab&s;olutely the Mi&s;tre&s;s of his
Affection, that without regarding his Duty to his
Wife, he lay every Night at her Hou&s;e. This
malicious Woman made u&s;e of the Power &s;he had
over him to irritate him again&s;t his injur'd Wife,
telling him, that he had rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect her Ver|tue,
&s;ince he gave her &s;o many inviting Oppor|tunities
of repaying him in his own Coin; and
his guilty Con&s;cience prompting him to conclude
that the might be as vicious as him&s;elf, he re&s;olv'd to
bring her along with him every Night, and made her
lie in the &s;ame Bed with him and his Concubine,
&s;ince there was not another in the Lodging.
Judge, Sir, with what Grief and Horrour this poor
Creature cou'd behold her <HI>due Benevolence</HI> &s;quander'd
away upon an impudent <HI>Doxey</HI> in her pre&s;ence;
<PB N="135" REF="86">
and whether ever any Woman was &s;o barbarou&s;ly

Indignity that cou'd be put upon a <HI>Wife;</HI> and
there is no Crime &s;o inhumane which &s;uch a
<HI>Husband</HI> wou'd not dare to commit. Thus &s;he
liv'd for above a Year, till at la&s;t her Patience
being intirely exhau&s;ted, &s;he was not able any
longer to bear the in&s;upportable Torment of be|ing
made the Spectatour of her own Shame and
Mi&s;ery; and therefore advis'd her Husband, &s;ince
he cou'd not overcome his Pa&s;&s;ion, to bring the
Cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;an home to his Hou&s;e, where he might en|joy
his Plea&s;ure with more Conveniency and le&s;s
Charge. This Advice was &s;o agreeable to his Hu|mour,
that he re&s;olv'd once in his Life to com|ply
with her De&s;ires: But &s;he had little rea&s;on
to be &s;atisfy'd with the Succe&s;s of her Propo&s;al,
for &s;he liv'd in a perpetual Hell with her pityle&s;s
Tormentour, and his in&s;olent Strumpet. But in|&s;tead
of making a tedious Relation of all the Af|fronts
they put upon her, I &s;hall only acquaint
you with the Tragical Conclu&s;ion of the Story.
He had a Son, about nine Years old, who having
&s;een his Mother at Church &s;peaking to one of her
Brothers, who was newly come from <HI>Italy,</HI> and
whom the Boy did not know, went immediately
to tell his Father, that his Mother was di&s;cour&s;ing
with a Stranger: And that inhumane Villain,
without enquiring farther into the Matter, or &s;o
much as accu&s;ing her of her Crime, &s;tabb'd her
with his Poniard as &s;oon as &s;he came home.</P>
<P>The other, who retir'd to the Church of S. <HI>Lewis,</HI>
was as unmerciful to his <HI>Whore</HI> as the former was
to his <HI>Wife.</HI> He knew that &s;he intended to Mar|ry,
and had often with horrible Threatnings for|bidden
her to pro&s;ecute that De&s;ign. But &s;he was
&s;o weary of her infamous way of Living, that
&s;he re&s;olv'd, notwith&s;tanding his repeated Menaces,
<PB N="136" REF="87">
to provide her&s;elf a Husband, and was even actu|ally
engag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d with a certain Trade&s;man. Her Gal|lant
hearing of this new Intrigue, and having &s;een
her two or three times talking with the young
Man's Si&s;ter, ran to her Hou&s;e in a Tran&s;port of
Fury, and immediately told her, that <HI>he was come
to kill her.</HI> She being ignorant of the cau&s;e of his
Rage, and imagining that he only intended to
laugh at her Fear, threw her Arms about his Neck,
and embracing him, <HI>And why, my Heart,</HI> &s;aid &s;he,
<HI>wou'd&s;t thou kill me? Becau&s;e thou art an impudent
Where,</HI> reply'd he, <HI>and wou'd&s;t Marry in &s;pite of me;
but I &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ll quickly cure thy Longing:</HI> Immediately
he &s;tabb'd her in the Brea&s;t with his Poniard, and
repeated the Blow four times, till he laid her dead
upon the Spot. The Barbarity of the&s;e Murde|rers
is &s;o prodigiou&s;ly inhumane, that the&s;e two
In&s;tances will give you a livelier <HI>Idea</HI> of the Hu|mour
of this People, than the mo&s;t pathetic De|&s;cription
I cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d make of it.</P>
<P>The Number of the <HI>Curte&s;ans</HI> is extremely great;
their Trade is not at all reputed &s;candalous; and
when they have earn'd a little Money, they may
Marry, and are e&s;teem'd as hone&s;t Women as if
they had kept their Maidenhead for their Husbands.
No Per&s;on what&s;oever dares offer 'em the lea&s;t
indignity; for they are look'd upon as Publick
Per&s;ons that ought to be Sacred; and there are
even &s;ome Ladies of Honour who di&s;dain not
their Acquaintance and Society; &s;o that 'tis not
an ea&s;ie Task to di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e Pro&s;titutes from
Vertueus Women. The Curte&s;ans of <HI>Rome</HI> and
<HI>Mal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> are beholding to the &s;ame Cau&s;e for the
Advantageous Privileges they enjoy: There the

and neither of 'em are able to keep their Vows.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> cannot forbear taking notice of a pretty odd
<PB N="137" REF="87">
Cu&s;tom in this Place, for the conveniency of
Strangers, who having no Acquaintance, and for
the mo&s;t part &s;taying but two or three Days in
the I&s;land, might be &s;ometimes oblig'd to leave it
without ta&s;ting its mo&s;t delicious Fruit: For 'tis
not the Fa&s;hion here to vi&s;it Strangers in their
Ships, as at <HI>Leghorn. Malta</HI> is a Land of Li|berty,
where Plea&s;ure is not forc'd upon any
Man: But they who have a mind to divert them|&s;elves,
may ea&s;ily find a Play-fellow by walking
about the Streets with a <HI>Sequin</HI> in their Hand,
holding it &s;o that it may be &s;een; for this is a
never-failing Signal, which will procure 'em twen|ty
Invitations in a Moment.</P>
<P>The Habit of the Women in this Place is as Me|lancholic
and Di&s;mal when they go abroad, as 'tis
Wanton and La&s;civious when they are at home. In
the Streets you &s;ee nothing but a long black Veil in|&s;tead
of a Woman, which covers 'em &s;o intirely from
Head to Foot, that &s;uch a &s;ight wou'd co&s;t a <HI>Low
Briton</HI> at lea&s;t twenty <HI>Signs of the Cro&s;s:</HI> for the Wo|men
in this City look ju&s;t like &s;o many <HI>Gho&s;ts</HI> wrapt
in Shrowds, &s;talking about the Streets. But if
they are <HI>Gho&s;ts</HI> in the Street, they are <HI>Angels</HI> at
home; for tho' the Pea&s;ants are tawny, the Wo|men
who live in the City have the faire&s;t Complexi|ons
in the World. I can only give you an Account
of their Summer Dre&s;s, &s;ince I never had occa&s;ion
to &s;ee 'em in the Winter. They wear a fine White
Smock, plaited at the Neck like a Man's Shirt;
but the Opening is &s;o wide, that it leaves their
Shoulders and Brea&s;ts intirely expos'd to the View of
the ravi&s;h'd Beholder: the Sleeves are very large,
and tuck'd up to the Neck-band of the Smock to
which they are fa&s;ten'd with a Pin, &s;o that one may
&s;ee their whole Arms. This Smock is almo&s;t their
intire Habit, for they wear nothing above it but a
very little Pair of Boddice about their Wa&s;te under
<PB N="138" REF="88">
their Brea&s;ts, which being not above a Span long,
&s;erves only to &s;et off the Finene&s;s of their Shape,
and rather expo&s;es than conceals tho&s;e alluring
Charms that &s;trike the Eyes and Hearts of the
Spectator with a &s;weet but irre&s;i&s;tible Violence. The
Mens Habit is not different from ours, at lea&s;t they
endeavour as much as they can, to imitate it.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t all the <HI>Malte&s;e</HI> are &s;erv'd by <HI>Slaves,</HI> who
are &s;uffer'd to walk freely about the Streets all day,
as well as tho&s;e who belong to the Order; but they
are all oblig'd to retire in the Evening to the publick
Baths, as at <HI>Leghorn,</HI> and if any of 'em &s;hou'd fail
to come at the time appointed, he wou'd be put
to death as a Fugitive. The <HI>Galley-Slaves</HI> are the
mo&s;t mi&s;erable Wretches in the World; yet there
are &s;ome Per&s;ons here who have &s;o little regard to
their own Happine&s;s, as to &s;ell them&s;elves for a hun|dred
Crowns to the Order: they continue Slaves
during their whole Life without any Pay, rowing
naked and chain'd as the re&s;t, without any other
Mark of Di&s;tinction than the Title of <HI>Bonne Vogue,</HI>
whereas the <HI>Turks</HI> are call'd <HI>Slaves.</HI> I know there
are al&s;o &s;ome of the&s;e voluntary Slaves at <HI>Venice,</HI>
where they are call'd <HI>Gallioti,</HI> and even the Repub|lick
finds le&s;s Difficulty in levying 'em than in rai|&s;ing
Soldiers: but they are only engag'd to &s;erve
three Years on the Galleys, whereas the <HI>Bonne Vogue</HI>
at <HI>Malta</HI> are perpetual Slaves, without the lea&s;t hope
of recovering their Liberty.</P>
<P>There are only &s;even <HI>Galleys</HI> belonging to the Or|der,
which are &s;ent every Year under the Command
of a General to a&s;&s;i&s;t the <HI>Venetians.</HI> The Govern|ment
is con&s;tantly employ'd about rai&s;ing new
Funds, without which they cannot encrea&s;e the
Number of their Galleys.</P>
<P>There are Three <HI>Languages</HI> &s;poken in the City;
the <HI>French, Spani&s;h,</HI> and <HI>Italian.</HI> The la&s;t of the&s;e
is authoriz'd by the Government, and us'd in pub|lick
<PB N="139" REF="88">
Writings. The Pea&s;ants in the Country &s;peak
a corrupt Dialect of the <HI>Arabic:</HI> and 'twou'd not be
an ea&s;ie Task to make 'em leave it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Holy Office of the Inqui&s;ition,</HI> that dreadful Tri|bunal,
famous for its Inju&s;tice and Cruelty, reigns
more Tyrannically here than at <HI>Rome</HI> it &s;elf. I have
heard a hundred remarkable Stories of its Barbarity;
but I'm too much your Friend to di&s;turb the Tran|quillity
of your Mind with &s;uch di&s;mal Relations.
And therefore in&s;tead of entring on &s;o Melancho|lic
a Subject, I &s;hall only ob&s;erve that <HI>Confe&s;&s;ors,</HI>
who in any other Country would be burnt if they
&s;hould divulge the Secrets with which they are in|tru&s;ted,
are oblig'd here to reveal 'em, as often as
the <HI>Inqui&s;ition</HI> is concern'd in the Di&s;covery. 'Tis
true, they do not own this Maxim, for fear of
&s;poiling their Trade; but the Truth of it is too
well known to be call'd in que&s;tion: In the mean
time, to prevent Su&s;picion, they are &s;ometimes &s;i|lent
for a Year or two, after which the <HI>Inqui&s;itor</HI>
&s;ends for the Party accus'd, and asks him whe|ther
he knows the rea&s;on why he is brought be|fore
him. Then mu&s;t the poor Wretch call to
mind all that ever he &s;aid; and if he has either
forgot his Fault, or refu&s;es to own it, confiding
in the Secrecy and Fidelity of his Confe&s;&s;our,
whom he knows to be his only Confident,
he's a dead Man, and mu&s;t not entertain the lea&s;t
hope of Mercy: For they &s;trangle him in Pri&s;on,
and &s;ome time after tell his Relations that they
may forbear &s;ending him Provi&s;ions. Happy are
they who are not &s;ubject to this Yoke!</P>
<P>I &s;aw a Church, t'other day, in which there
is a little <HI>Grotto,</HI> where 'tis &s;aid S. <HI>Paul</HI> liv'd three
Months: But 'tis &s;o &s;mall, and contriv'd in &s;uch
a manner, that I'm much enclin'd to &s;u&s;pect the
Truth of this Tradition. However, every one
that comes, carries away a piece of it, as a Pre|&s;ervative
<PB N="140" REF="89">
again&s;t the biting of Serpents: And they
pretend that by a perpetual Miracle, the Rock is
never dimini&s;h'd. I will not di&s;pute the Truth of
the Matter of Fact, tho' I can a&s;&s;ure you that
there are vi&s;ible Gaps or Notches in the Rock,
and that they &s;till continue to break off Pieces of
it: But &s;uppo&s;ing it to be as big as ever, I &s;ee
no rea&s;on why we &s;hou'd have recour&s;e to a Mi|racle
on this Occa&s;ion, &s;ince 'tis generally acknow|ledg'd,
that there are &s;ome Rocks which grow
naturally till they be &s;eparated from their Roots:
And our Mariners, who are no very able Philo|&s;ophers,

which is commonly call'd the <HI>Brothers;</HI> and why
may not S. <HI>Paul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s Grotto</HI> be of the &s;ame Nature.
But this is not the only <HI>Miracle</HI> in <HI>Malta:</HI> They
tell us, that there are no <HI>Serpents</HI> in the I&s;land,
and wou'd have us believe that this Privilege was
the Effect of a Viper's biting the &s;ame Apo&s;tle,
as you may read in the <HI>Acts of the Apo&s;tles.</HI> For
my part, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I'm as little &s;atisfy'd
with this Sotry as with the other; for &s;ome Per|&s;ons
a&s;&s;ure me that there are Serpents in <HI>Malta:</HI> But
&s;uppo&s;ing there were none, I had occa&s;ion to men|tion
another I&s;land in my la&s;t, which may boa&s;t

be greater here than at <HI>Guern&s;ey,</HI> where tis
certain there is neither <HI>Toad, Scorpion,</HI> nor any o|ther
Venomous Creature: And, which adds to the
Wonder, I know that the Governour, who is a

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE &s;ail'd from <HI>Malta, June...,</HI> and leaving
<HI>Sicily</HI> on our Left-hand, enter'd the <HI>Archi|pelago.</HI>
After a Voyage of fifteen Days, without
any remarkable Di&s;turbance, we arriv'd at the
Height of <HI>Troy,</HI> and our Ve&s;&s;el &s;tanding in to
<HI>Tenedos,</HI> both by rea&s;on of the contrary Wind,
and to take in &s;ome fre&s;h Provi&s;ions, I took this
Occa&s;ion to vi&s;it the Ruines of that famous City,
which are at pre&s;ent &s;o ob&s;cure and incon&s;iderable,
that unle&s;s a Man's Mind were full of the <HI>Idea</HI> of
it, he might view it all over without perceiving
the lea&s;t rea&s;on to conclude that ever any Town
&s;tood in that place. Yet by a Curious Search, an
inqui&s;itive Traveller may find enough to convince
him, that 'twas formerly of a prodigious Extent:
And I ob&s;erv'd &s;ome Marks of it in four or five
different Places, two of which were about twen|ty
Miles di&s;tant. The next Day we &s;et &s;ail with
a favourable Wind, and enter'd the Canal of <HI>Con&s;tan|tinople,</HI>
otherwi&s;e call'd the <HI>Helle&s;pont,</HI> at the Mouth
of which we found two Ca&s;tles, one in <HI>Europe,</HI>
and the other in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> &s;eparated by the Canal or
Strait, which is about a Mile and a half broad
in this Place, and retains the &s;ame breadth almo&s;t
throughout. The <HI>European</HI> Ca&s;tle is a Ma&s;s com|pos'd
of three great Towers, &s;urrounded with a
weak and incon&s;iderable Wall, after the manner of
a <HI>Fal&s;e-bray,</HI> at the Foot of which there are twen|ty
Pieces of Cannon level with the Water. 'Tis
&s;aid that they carry a fifty Pound Ball of Stone;
and indeed their Mouths are &s;o wide, that the
<PB N="143" REF="90">
very &s;ight of 'em is terrible: Neverthele&s;s, I'm apt
to believe that they are not fit for Service, and
even that they cou'd not bear above one di&s;charge,
both by rea&s;on of their thinne&s;s, and becau&s;e
they are not mounted on Carriages. There is
a Mountain behind the Ca&s;tle that overlooks and
commands it.</P>
<P>The other Ca&s;tle, which is &s;eated upon the
<HI>A&s;ian</HI> Shore, is of a Square Figure, according to the
Ancient manner of Building, defended only with
&s;ome &s;mall Towers join'd to the Wall; and with|out
there is a Battery of Cannons behind a Wall,
as in the other. The Captain was oblig'd to &s;top
at this place, and one of the Officers of the Cu|&s;tom-Hou&s;e
came on board our Ship, and accom|pany'd
us to <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> Having pa&s;s'd the Ca|nal,
we enter'd into the Sea formerly call'd the
<HI>Propontis,</HI> and at pre&s;ent <HI>Marmora,</HI> from the Name
of an I&s;land which contains a great quantity of
very fine Marble. Twenty Miles from thence we
di&s;cover'd <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and had the plea&s;ure of
viewing the fine&s;t Landskip that ever I beheld;
for it &s;trikes all tho&s;e who look upon it with
Wonder and A&s;toni&s;hment. Imagine you &s;ee a
great City &s;tretch'd along the Shore for above &s;ix
Miles, and &s;o &s;ituated &s;loping towards the Sea,
that you perceive at once an infinite Number of
Mo&s;quees, adorn'd with little Domes cover'd with
Lead, and high Turrets, which altogether make
one of the mo&s;t lovely Pro&s;pects in the World:
Whil&s;t the Eye is bu&s;y'd in contemplating this
charming Variety of Objects, 'tis agreeably divert|ed
with the &s;ight of the <HI>Ca&s;tle of the Seven Towers,</HI>
and of the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> which are particularly remark|able
not only for their largene&s;s, but for a va&s;t
Number of gilt Globes and Spires, re&s;embling lit|tle
Steeples. The nearer I approach'd, I &s;till di&s;|cover'd
new Ornaments; and after I had con&s;i|der<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d
<PB N="144" REF="91">
at lei&s;ure &s;o many Wonders, I was at la&s;t
agreeably &s;urpriz'd with the Beauty of the Port:
'Tis three Miles long, and almo&s;t one broad, clean
and deep throughout, even to the Shoar, the lar|ge&s;t
Ships coming up clo&s;e to the Land, &s;o that
one may go on board without making u&s;e of a
Boat. 'Tis &s;trange that the Harbour is never fill'd
up, e&s;pecially near the Shore, &s;ince all the Filth
of the City is ca&s;t into it, without the Advan|tage
of a Tide to carry it away. At the En|trance
into the Port there is a high &s;quare Tower,
commonly call'd <HI>The Tower of Leander,</HI> from a Per|&s;on
of that Name, who, according to the Story,
us'd to &s;wim thither every Night to &s;ee his Mi|&s;tre&s;s,
who was impri&s;on'd in the Tower. There
is a Fountain on the Rock, with &s;ome Pieces of
Cannon, which might defend the Entry in ca&s;e of
Nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we arriv'd, I went with the Captain
to &s;alute the Baron <HI>de Cha&s;teau-neuf,</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador
of <HI>France,</HI> who receiv'd me very civilly. He has
a good Mien, and is Ma&s;ter of a great deal of
Wit: He was formerly Councellor in the Parlia|ment
of <HI>Paris,</HI> and was &s;ent to the Port about the
end of the la&s;t Year, in the room of Mon&s;ieur
<HI>de Girardin,</HI> who died here. He is a <HI>Savoyard</HI> by
birth, but a very zealous Promoter of the Intere&s;ts
of <HI>Franee:</HI> He &s;pares nothing to gain the <HI>Turks;</HI>
he endeavours to win 'em with Pre&s;ents, Care&s;&s;es,
and Entertainments; his Table is always full of
'em; but his principal Care is to oblige tho&s;e
whom he knows to be the Favourites of the great
Officers. I know one among the re&s;t, call'd <HI>So|liman
Aga,</HI> who is extremely debauch'd, and &s;ince
he always finds excellent Win<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> at the Amba&s;&s;a|dor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s
Table, he goes thither very often, and is &s;till
receiv'd with all imaginable Demon&s;trations of
Love and Kindne&s;s. After I had the Honour to
<PB N="145" REF="91">
Sup with the Amba&s;&s;adour, I went to lodge at
a Tavern, or Victualling-Hou&s;e. If I had re&s;olv'd
to have &s;tay'd long in the Country, I wou'd have
boarded in &s;ome Family, for Strangers are very
ill accomodated in the&s;e Publick-Hou&s;es. Every
Nation is permitted to have three; &s;o that there
wou'd be nine in all, if the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI>
thought fit to make u&s;e of their Privilege: 'Tis
&s;till more difficult to obtain a Permi&s;&s;ion to keep
an Oven: One mu&s;t procure a &s;pecial <HI>Mandamus</HI>
from the <HI>Sultan</HI> for that effect, and pay a Thou|&s;and
<HI>Avanies</HI> to the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI> and <HI>Cadi;</HI> and there is
only one allow'd for the u&s;e of each Nation in
every Town; for the <HI>Turks</HI> are &s;o extremely afraid
of Fire, that they &s;uffer very few Ovens to be
kept in their Cities. They are al&s;o very careful to
prevent the Exportation of Corn; for 'tis a Ca|pital
Crime to carry it out of the Country, or
even to &s;ell it to private Families: And for the
more effectual Execution of the&s;e Orders, there
are certain Officers appointed to over-&s;ee the Mar|kets,
who &s;uffer no Man to buy a|bove
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Somewhat more than 20 Quarters.</NOTE><HI>Four Muids</HI> at a time, nor even
the lea&s;t quantity, without a Licence
from the <HI>Nais.</HI> Offences of this Na|ture
are puni&s;h'd with &s;o much Rigour, that if a
Pea&s;ant were convicted of &s;elling his Corn to a
<HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> 'twou'd co&s;t him more than 500 Ba&s;tina|do's.
But before I proceed to de&s;cribe the Man|ners
and Cu&s;toms of the Inhabitants, I &s;hall give
you a &s;hort Account of the City of <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis &s;eated in <HI>Europe,</HI> on a Point or Tongue of
Land that juts out into the Sea of <HI>Marmora,</HI> in
a Triangular Figure, &s;ix Miles long, and fourteen
in compa&s;s, two of its &s;ides being wa&s;h'd by the
Sea. 'Twas founded by <HI>Pau&s;anias,</HI> King of <HI>Sparta,</HI>
who gave it the Name of <HI>Byzantium,</HI> which it re|tain'd
<PB N="146" REF="92">
till <HI>Con&s;tantine the Great,</HI> re&s;olving to make
it the Metropolis of the World, order'd it to be
rebuilt with all imaginable Magnificence; after
which it took the Name of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> or <HI>Con|&s;tantine's
Town;</HI> but the <HI>Turks</HI> call it <HI>Stambol.</HI> The
<HI>French,</HI> in Conjunction with the <HI>Venetians,</HI> took it
in 1203. and fifty Years after &punc;twas re-taken by
the <HI>Greeks,</HI> who remain'd Ma&s;ters of it till the
Year 1453, when it fell into the Hands of <HI>Ma|homet</HI>
II. 'Tis at pre&s;ent the Capital City of the
<HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, as it appears by the <HI>Grand Sig|nior's</HI>
Titles, who &s;tiles him&s;elf, <HI>The Ruler of Kings,
Di&s;tributer of Crowns, Lord of the</HI> White <HI>and</HI> Black
<HI>Seas, of</HI> Bagdat, Grand Cairo, Aleppo, <HI>&amp;c. and
particularly of the fain City of</HI> Stambol the well-defen|ded,
<HI>which is the De&s;ire of the Kings and Princes of
the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Air</HI> is extremely pure, and &s;o whol&s;ome,
that the Inhabitants are never &s;ubject to any
reigning Di&s;ea&s;e but the <HI>Plague,</HI> which vi&s;its 'em
every Year, and makes a dreadful Havock among
'em. I'm apt to think that they wou'd live till
they dropt into their Graves through meer
Age and Weakne&s;s, if their Days were not
&s;horten'd by this Infectious Malady; and they are
&s;o little acquainted with any other mortal Di|&s;temper,
that when a <HI>Frenchman</HI> a&s;&s;ures 'em that
the <HI>Plague</HI> is hardly known in his Country, they
u&s;ually cry, <HI>What d'ye die of then?</HI> The <HI>Climate</HI> is
&s;o Temperate, that the Winters are never exce&s;&s;ively
Cold, and the Summer-Heats are u&s;ually allay'd
with a plea&s;ant Brieze, be&s;ides the drinking of
cool Liquors, which, in my Opinion, is one of
the greate&s;t Plea&s;ures of this Life.</P>
<P>In the Account I have given you of the Situ|ation
and Bigne&s;s of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> I &s;peak only of
the City which properly bears that Name; for
there are four other Towns join'd together, call'd
<PB N="147" REF="92">
<HI>Ca&s;&s;um Pacha, Galata, Pera,</HI> and <HI>Tophana,</HI> which may
be con&s;ider'd as a part, or rather as the Suburbs
of the City, &s;ince they are only &s;eparated from it
by the breadth of the Port, which is &s;o &s;mall a
di&s;tance, that a Man who cries aloud, tho' with|out
extending his Voice to the utmo&s;t, may be
ea&s;ily heard on the other &s;ide. In the&s;e Towns,
and particularly in <HI>Pera,</HI> the Amba&s;&s;adors and all
the <HI>Franks</HI> live; for they are not permitted to
re&s;ide at <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> And 'tis to be ob&s;erv'd,
that the Name of <HI>Franks</HI> is given indifferenly to
Men of all Nations who wear Hats. The&s;e four
Cities are about eight Miles in compa&s;s; &s;o that
if they, together with the Village of <HI>Scutaret,</HI> and
&s;ome other Suburbs, be added to the City of <HI>Con|&s;tantinople,</HI>
and all join'd together to make one va&s;t
Town, <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> in this &s;en&s;e, wou'd be found
to be double of <HI>Paris.</HI> But there is a great variety of
Opinions in this Ca&s;e: Some comprehend all the a|bove-mention'd
places under the Name of <HI>Con&s;tan|tinople,</HI>
others cut off the four Cities; and there
are &s;ome who include the City within the com|pa&s;s
of its own Walls; &s;o that almo&s;t every Tra|veller
gives a different Account of its Extent from
all others.</P>
<P>The Walls with which 'tis at pre&s;ent &s;urroun|ded,
are the &s;ame that were built by <HI>Con&s;tan|&s;tine
the Great,</HI> except in &s;ome places where they
have been repair'd. They are double on the &s;ide
next the Land, with Battlements, after the <HI>Oriental</HI>
fa&s;hion, and Towers from place to place; and be|&s;ides,
they are defended with a lin'd but &s;hallow
Ditch: The&s;e, with the <HI>Ca&s;tle of the Seven Towers,</HI>
are all the Strength of <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> for the Num|ber
of its Inhabitants de&s;erves not to be reckon'd
among its Advantages, &s;ince tho&s;e <HI>Turks</HI> who are
never accu&s;tom'd to War, are &s;o unfit to re&s;i&s;t
an Enemy, that they wou'd only &s;erve to con&s;ume
<PB N="148" REF="93">
the Provi&s;ions, and ha&s;ten a Famine: And be&s;ides,
I'm per&s;uaded that Bombs wou'd do more execu|tion
here than in any other City in the World;
for the Hou&s;es are generally of Wood, and the
Streets &s;o narrow, that in the greate&s;t part of
'em two loaded Hor&s;es cannot go a-brea&s;t. But
this is not the greate&s;t inconvenience of their
manner of Building; for their Hou&s;es jut out &s;o
far near the Top, that in &s;everal places one may
&s;tep from one Window to another, and cro&s;s the
Street without going down from his Chamber.
This Contrivance of their Hou&s;es does not pro|ceed
from want of Room, for the City is full of
Gardens, and large Courts, that are perfectly u&s;e|le&s;s.
But tho' I cannot acquaint you with the
rea&s;on that makes 'em &s;o fond of this manner of
Building, I can a&s;&s;ure you that it expo&s;es 'em to
all tho&s;e fatal Inconveniencies that are occa&s;ion'd
by <HI>Fire,</HI> which breaks out very frequently, and
proceeds with irre&s;i&s;table Fury, till it meets with
&s;ome Garden, or empty Place, where there are
no Hou&s;es to be burnt. Among &s;o many In&s;tan|ces
of this Nature, I &s;hall only take notice of one
that happen'd in the Year 88, which made &s;o ter|rible
a Havock in the City, that there were a|bove
3000 Hou&s;es laid in A&s;hes. But be&s;ides the
dangerous Con&s;equences of this kind of Archite|cture,
'tis al&s;o very offen&s;ive to the Eye; for the
Streets are extremely disfigur'd by this Irregulari|ty:
Nor are there any external Ornaments on the
Hou&s;es to make amends for this Defect, &s;ince they
are only daub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d over with a na&s;ty red Paint, laid
upon the rough Wood, which is neither plan'd,
nor cut with any other In&s;trument than an Axe
or Saw; &s;o that the Hou&s;es are all very ugly.
Judge, Sir, what rea&s;on I had to be &s;urpriz'd,
when after I had view'd with Amazement the
magnificent Pro&s;pect of the City from the <HI>Sea of
<PB N="149" REF="93">
Marmora,</HI> I &s;aw all my Expectations baulk'd, and
in&s;tead of &s;o many Wonders, found only &s;ome
<HI>Mo&s;ques,</HI> and a few Monuments of <HI>Antiquity.</HI> Not
that I wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d di&s;courage any Curious Per&s;on from
undertaking this Voyage; for tho' the Manners
and Cu&s;toms of the Inhabitants ought never to
be propos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d for Imitation, they are &s;o odd and
&s;ingular, that an Inqui&s;itive Traveller may employ
his Time and Curio&s;ity with a great deal of Plea|&s;ure
in ob&s;erving 'em. The <HI>Turks</HI> are oppo&s;ite to
us in almo&s;t all re&s;pects: We content our &s;elves
with one Wife, They marry &s;everal Wives; Our
Habit is &s;hort, Theirs long; We wear our Hair
long, and our Beards &s;hav'd, They &s;have their Hair,
and &s;uffer their Beards to grow; We write in a
&s;treight Line from Left to Right, and They in a
crooked from Right to Left. I cou'd ea&s;ily add
&s;everal other In&s;tances of the &s;ame Nature, &s;ince
the Oppo&s;ition reaches even to the meane&s;t Acti|ons,
&s;uch as the ea&s;ing of Nature; for they crouch
down to Pi&s;s, like Women, and when they have
done, rub their Privities on a Wall, which they
think purifies 'em.</P>
<P>Two Days after our Arrival at <HI>Galata,</HI> the Cap|tain
and I went to &s;ee <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> with the <HI>French</HI>
Interpreter, who accompany'd us on purpo&s;e to
&s;how us all the Curio&s;ities. There are always &s;o
many Boats pa&s;&s;ing from one &s;ide to another, that
the Port is u&s;ually cover'd with 'em, and their Fare
is only an <HI>A&s;per.</HI> We took Boat at the <HI>Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e,</HI>
and enter'd the City at the Gate of <HI>Gala|ta,</HI>
or the next Gate to the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> which we
kept on our Left-hand, and went &s;treight to the
<HI>Be&s;e&s;tin,</HI> which is a di&s;tinct Canton of the City,
enclos'd with Gates and Walls, where all the Mer|chants
keep Shops. This is the fine&s;t and mo&s;t
regular place in <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> not unlike to the
places that are appointed for the keeping of <HI>Fairs</HI>
<PB N="150" REF="94">
among us, &s;uch as that of S. <HI>Germain</HI> at <HI>Paris:</HI>
The Streets are divided after the &s;ame manner, and
cover'd above with Planks join'd together upon
Rafters, which form a kind of Roof, &s;ufficient to
&s;ecure the place again&s;t all the Inconveniences of
bad Weather, tho' there are Holes left to let in
the Light. Here all the fine&s;t and mo&s;t precious
Wares of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> are to be &s;een; for every
Merchant keeps a Shop in this Place, as it were
for a Pattern of all the Goods contain'd in his
Ware-hou&s;e; and the Shops are rank'd and di&s;pos'd
in &s;uch excellent Order, that the Buyer may di|&s;patch
his Bu&s;ine&s;s in le&s;s than a quarter of an
Hour; for all the Trades are &s;eparated, and con|fin'd
to their proper places. Thus one part of the
<HI>Be&s;e&s;tin</HI> is po&s;&s;e&s;s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d by the <HI>gold&s;miths,</HI> who&s;e Work,
indeed, is not &s;o fine, nor their Shops &s;o well
furni&s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d as in <HI>France</HI> or <HI>England;</HI> but I only &s;peak
here of their Order and Regularity: Another
place is &s;et apart for the <HI>Drapers,</HI> or tho&s;e who &s;ell
<HI>Dutch, French,</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloth: Not far from
thence are the Sellers of Silk Stuffs, and Gold and
Silver Brocado's; the Makers of <HI>Talpo,</HI> or Head-Dre&s;&s;es
for Women, which are very magnificent;
the <HI>Babouchi,</HI> or <HI>Shoo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">-makers,</HI> the <HI>Taylors, Grocers,</HI>
and all &s;ort of Shopkeepers, have al&s;o their di|&s;tinct
Streets. The Gates are &s;hut every Evening
at Ten a Clock, by Per&s;ons who are hir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d for
that purpo&s;e, and tho&s;e who have occa&s;ion to pa&s;s
this way later, mu&s;t give two or three Pence to
the Porters, who wait con&s;tantly at the Gates.
This is the only place in <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> where there
are Shops; for the re&s;t of the City con&s;i&s;ts only
of little and narrow Streets, which for the mo&s;t part
are &s;o de&s;olate that one may pa&s;s thro' the Town
without meeting &s;o many Per&s;ons as Streets, unle&s;s in
the Publick Places, &s;uch as the <HI>Hyppodrome,</HI> whither we
went after we had view'd the <HI>Be&s;e&s;tin.</HI> This &s;pacious
<PB N="151" REF="94">
Place was built by the Emperour <HI>Con&s;tantine,</HI> for
Exerci&s;es on Hor&s;e-back, and is &s;till call'd by the
<HI>Turks,</HI> the <HI>Place of Hor&s;es.</HI> 'Tis an Oblong Square,
400 Paces long, and about 200 broad. Towards
the End oppo&s;ite to the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> there are two
<HI>Obelisks;</HI> the fir&s;t con&s;i&s;ting of one Stone, is &s;even|ty
Foot high, adorn'd with &s;everal Hieroglyphical
Figures in <HI>Relief,</HI> and plac'd on a &s;quare Marble
Pede&s;tal. On one of the Faces of the Pede&s;tal,
there is a <HI>Latin</HI> In&s;cription, &s;o ancient and worn,
that all that can be learn'd by it is, that it was
built by <HI>Theodo&s;ius:</HI> The &s;econd contains a like
In&s;cription in <HI>Greek:</HI> The third is adorn'd with
the Figure of the Emperour &s;eated on a Throne,
and accompany'd with his great Officers; and in
the fourth there is a Repre&s;entation of a Battle,
in Memory of &s;ome Victory obtain'd over that
Prince's Enemies. The other <HI>Obelisk</HI> is a &s;harp
pointed <HI>Pyramid,</HI> built of Free-Stones, without any
In&s;cription, and begins to decay extremely. Near
the&s;e <HI>Obelisks</HI> there is a Brazen Pillar of a con&s;i|derable
height, commonly call'd the <HI>Serpentine Co|lumn,</HI>
becau&s;e it con&s;i&s;ts of three Serpents wreath'd
and twi&s;ted together, with their Tails fa&s;ten'd in
the Ground, and ending at the Top in three ga|ping
Heads, which &s;eem to hi&s;s, and threaten the
three parts of the World that were known in
that Age. Some pretend that this Column is a
Hieroglyphical Repre&s;entation of the united Em|pires
of the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t,</HI> extending their Do|minion
over the whole Univer&s;e: But the mo&s;t
common Opinion is, that in the time of the Em|perour
<HI>Leo I&s;aurus,</HI> who was a great Magician,
there were three Mon&s;truous <HI>Serpents,</HI> who made
&s;o prodigious a Havock in the Country about
<HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> that the People were forc'd to aban|don
their Habitations; and that the Emperor
drew the&s;e Serpents by Enchantment into a large
<PB N="152" REF="95">
Ditch, which he made in the middle of the <HI>Hippo|drome,</HI>
where they were kill'd, and cover'd with
Earth. The Story adds, that to prevent a like
Misfortune for the future, this Column was ere|cted
by the &s;ame Prince, as a <HI>Tali&s;man</HI> again&s;t
Serpents, of which there are at pre&s;ent very few
in the Country. One of the&s;e Heads wants the
the Nether-Jaw, and 'tis &s;aid that <HI>Sultan Morat</HI>
broke it off with his Hand. The <HI>Turks</HI> boa&s;t
much of the wonderful Strength of that Empe|rour,

<P>The Story of the <HI>Serpentine Column</HI> is not the only
fabulous Tradition concerning the Emperour <HI>Leo.</HI>
The <HI>Greeks,</HI> e&s;pecially, who are without Contra|diction
the mo&s;t &s;uper&s;titious People in the World,
and mo&s;t addicted to Miracles, take plea&s;ure in
relating a Thou&s;and Wonders of the Life of that
Prince. For Example: They tell us that he made
two <HI>Torto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;es,</HI> by Art Magick, of a &s;urprizing big|ne&s;s,
which drew his Chariot, and both Eat and
Drank, tho' they were not natural Animals; ad|ding,
that the&s;e <HI>Tertoi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> are &s;till to be &s;een in the
<HI>Grand Sign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">or's</HI> Garden, but that they have remain'd
immoveable ever &s;ince his Death. They pretend
al&s;o that the &s;ame Emperour made a <HI>Tree</HI> with

that they &s;eem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d to be perfectly Natural, and that
the Boughs were fill'd with a hundred <HI>Magical
Birds</HI> of different kinds, who upon the lea&s;t breath
of Wind, warbl'd out their various Notes, and all
together made a mo&s;t charming Melody. The&s;e
are &s;ome of the Tales with which the <HI>Greeks</HI> are
wont to talk Men a&s;leep.</P>
<P>There are two other Columns in <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI>
<PB N="153" REF="95">
one call'd the <HI>Hi&s;torical,</HI> and the other the <HI>Burnt

to the&s;e we &s;aw a large Court, appointed for the
u&s;e of <HI>Archers:</HI> The Ma&s;ter of the Sport pre&s;ented
us with a Bow, and we had the Plea&s;ure to &s;hoot
&s;ome Arrows at the Mark, which was fa&s;ten'd on
a Wall, and contain'd &s;everal le&s;&s;er Marks, gra|dually

100 Paces off.</P>
<P>In our return to <HI>Galata</HI> we pa&s;s'd by <HI>Sancta So|phia,</HI>
which is at pre&s;ent the principal <HI>Mo&s;que</HI> of
the City. There are &s;everal Doors that lead into
a Portico, which brought us immediately into the
Mo&s;que. 'Tis 120 Paces long, and 80 broad: The
Walls are Square, but the Vault or Roof is Round,
and &s;o artificially contriv'd, that &s;o large a Stru|cture
is &s;upported without any Columns; for tho&s;e
Rows of Columns that form the two lower Por|tico's,
&s;erve only for Ornament, and are &s;o plac'd
that they cannot be &s;uppos'd to carry any other
weight than that of two Galleries; and even the
greate&s;t part of the&s;e Columns are &s;o old, that they
are forc'd to bind 'em about with great Iron Hoops,
to prevent their falling. I know not what cou'd
occa&s;ion all tho&s;e Chinks that are ob&s;erv'd in 'em,
for they are built of a very hard and poli&s;h'd Stone,
which &s;ome think is a kind of Marble, tho' others
believe it to be the <HI>Serpentine Stone.</HI> There are
thirty on each &s;ide, about &s;ixteen Foot high, with
very fine Cornices: The Vault of the Mo&s;que re|tains
almo&s;t all its ancient Beauty; 'tis enrich'd
with a very fine <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Work, con&s;i&s;ting of little
gilt Stones &s;o exactly join'd together, that they
remain almo&s;t perfectly entire after &s;o many Ages.</P>
<P>At the four Corners of the Building where the
Vault begins to be round, the <HI>four Bea&s;ts</HI> mention'd

the principal Door, repre&s;ented after the <HI>Greek</HI>
Fa&s;hion, upon a Throne, with his Hand lifted,
and two of his Fingers &s;tretch'd out, to ble&s;s a
<HI>Saint,</HI> who lies pro&s;trate before him, with his Face on
the Ground, the <HI>Virgin</HI> appearing on the other &s;ide.
Over the &s;ame Door there is al&s;o a <HI>Ba&s;&s;o-Relievo,</HI>
repre&s;enting the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> in the form of a <HI>Dove,</HI>
which the <HI>Turks</HI> have not in the lea&s;t disfigur'd.
The Tomb of <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> remains al&s;o intire, which
the <HI>Turks</HI> hold in great Veneration; as well as the
Stone on which the <HI>Virgin</HI> wa&s;h'd <HI>Our Saviour's</HI>
Linnen. This Temple is pav'd with very fine
Marble, and the Floor is cover'd with Mats; not
to keep it from being foil'd, for they always put
off their <HI>Babouche's,</HI> or Shooes, before they enter;
but by rea&s;on of the coldne&s;s of the Marble, which
might incommode tho&s;e who come to perform their

times they are &s;o Surly and Ob&s;tinate, that one
can hardly procure that Satisfaction at the rate of
ten Pi&s;toles. 'Tis true, indeed, they are expre&s;ly
forbidden to grant that favour to <HI>Chri&s;tians;</HI> and
the permi&s;&s;ion which is &s;ometimes given to <HI>Franks,</HI>
is only an effect of their Indulgence: For if a

di&s;appear'd, only the Trea&s;ure remain'd, which
the Emperor receiv'd with all the Marks of a joy|ful
Gratitude, and employ'd it in building and
adorning the Church of <HI>Sancta Sophia</HI> in &s;o admi|rable
a manner, that the <HI>Temple of Solomon</HI> in its
highe&s;t Glory, was neither more Beautiful nor Mag|nificent.
He built al&s;o with the &s;ame Money a
large and &s;tately <HI>Ho&s;pital,</HI> where Per&s;ons of all
Nations were charitably entertain'd. And &s;ince
there was &s;till a great quantity of Trea&s;ure left,
which the Emperor's Piety wou'd not &s;uffer him
to employ in prophane U&s;es, he order'd the Jew|els
to be &s;amp'd to Powder, and the Gold and
Silver to be melted, and mixing 'em all together,
he made the mo&s;t precious Table that ever adorn'd
<PB N="157" REF="97">
a Temple, and plac'd it on the High Altar, to
&s;erve at the daily Con&s;ecration of the Sacrament,
where it remain'd till the <HI>Venetians</HI> carry'd it away
with tho&s;e admirable Brazen Gates, which are at
pre&s;ent to be &s;een at S. <HI>Mark's.</HI> But God wou'd
not &s;uffer &s;o Holy a Piece to become a Prey to
tho&s;e who cou'd not pretend any right to it;
the Galley that carry'd it open'd miraculou&s;ly at
the Mouth of the Canal, in the Sea of <HI>Marmora,</HI>
where it &s;unk, and was never afterwards found.</P>
<P>This, Sir, (if you have Faith enough to believe
it) is the Original of <HI>Sancta Sophia,</HI> which was for|merly
a <HI>Chri&s;tian Church,</HI> and is now a <HI>Turki&s;h Mo&s;|quee.</HI>
'Tis at pre&s;ent the only Ancient Structure
of that Nature in <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> for all the re&s;t
were built in this and the la&s;t Age, by the <HI>Sul|tans</HI>
or <HI>Sultane&s;&s;es,</HI> who&s;e Names they bear. There
are &s;even or eight particularly remarkable, I mean
tho&s;e of the <HI>Sultans Mahomet, Achmet, Solyman,</HI> and
<HI>Selim,</HI> with tho&s;e of <HI>Chazadet,</HI> and <HI>Valid&eacute;,</HI> and &s;ome
others, built after the &s;ame Model, and differing
only in the largene&s;s of the Structure, the Num|ber
of the Fountains, and variety of the Painting;
&s;o that the De&s;cription of one will give a ju&s;t
<HI>Idea</HI> of all the re&s;t, and therefore I &s;hall make
choice of that of <HI>Valide,</HI> which is the newe&s;t and
mo&s;t beautiful Mo&s;que I have yet &s;een: 'Twas
built by the <HI>Sultane&s;s Valid&eacute;,</HI> Mother of <HI>Sultan Ma|homet</HI>
IV. and is &s;eated in the mid&s;t of a large
&s;quare Court, re&s;embling a va&s;t Cloy&s;ter, becau&s;e
of the arch'd Roofs that inviron it in form of
Portico's; under which there are many Fountains
with Cocks, where tho&s;e who are polluted may
wa&s;h them&s;elves before they enter the Mo&s;quee.
It has but one Gate, &s;urrounded with a Portico
of a con&s;iderable height, pav'd with white and
black Marble, and &s;upported by &s;ixty four Co|lumns
of red Marble, eight of which are of Por|phyrie,
<PB N="158" REF="98">
plac'd near the Entry, but of no very re|gular
De&s;ign, becau&s;e the bigne&s;s of the Pieces is pre|&s;erv'd
entire: The Plafond is adorn'd with Paint|ing
and Figures, after the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> manner, of which
afterwards you may expect a more particular Ac|count.
The Portico is cover'd with little Domes,
with a very large one in the middle, over-topping
the re&s;t; the whole Structure con&s;i&s;ting of Ma|&s;on's-Work
cover'd with Lead. At the four Cor|ners
of the Building there are four Turrets, call'd
<HI>Minarets,</HI> built of Free-Stone, and &s;o &s;mall that
there is ju&s;t room enough within for a little Winding-Stair-ca&s;e,
reaching to three fourth parts of the
Height, which the <HI>Muezans,</HI> or <HI>Marabouds,</HI> a&s;cend
every Morning and Evening, to give the People
notice of the appointed times of Prayer, &s;houting
till they are out of Breath, with an extremely
har&s;h and di&s;agreeable Tone; for they begin with
a very low Voice, and rai&s;ing it by degrees, end
in a very loud Shriek, &s;o that 'twou'd be impo&s;|&s;ible
to under&s;tand 'em, if the People were not
already acquainted with what they &s;ay. As they
cry, they clap their Hands upon their Ears, and
go round the Turret in a little Balcony, that their
Voice may be heard thro' the whole Town, re|peating
the&s;e Words; <HI>Allah ekber, allah ekber, allah
ekber, e&s;chadou in la illah, illallah, hi alle &s;alla, hi alle
&s;alla, allah ekber, allah ekber, allah ekber, la illah, illal|lah.
God is Great, God is Great, God is Great; give
te&s;timony that there is but One God: Come yield your
&s;elves up to his Mercy, and pray him to forgive you
your Sins. God is Great, God is Great, God is Great,
there is no other God but God.</HI> The&s;e Turrets are very
high, and for the mo&s;t part end in a Globe or Cre|&s;cent,
which is &s;ometimes Gilt. This is a brief
Repre&s;entation of the external Architecture of <HI>Va|lid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI>
and con&s;equently of the other Mo&s;quees.
Within they are either vaulted, or cover'd with a
<PB N="159" REF="98">
Plafond: That of <HI>Valid&eacute;</HI> is vaulted, and adorn'd
with a great Number of Lamps, and Globes of
Gla&s;s. When they &s;ay Prayers, they turn their
Face towards a large Frame at the end of the
Mo&s;que, in the &s;ame place where the High-Al|tar
&s;tands in <HI>Roman-Catholick</HI> Churches. There is
no Figure repre&s;ented on this Frame or Table,
only the Name of GOD is written on it in <HI>Ara|bick</HI>
Characters; and over-again&s;t it &s;tands two
Brazen Candle&s;ticks, with a Taper of Virgin-Wax
in each, bigger than a Man's Thigh. In the Mo&s;|quees
that are founded by Emper&ocirc;rs, there is u|&s;ually
a <HI>Turb&eacute;,</HI> or little Chappel, in which they are
bury'd. Some <HI>Sultans</HI> have built <HI>Turbe's</HI> apart, re|&s;embling
little Mo&s;quees. Tho&s;e of <HI>Amurat</HI> and
<HI>Solyman</HI> I. are th&egrave; fine&s;t: The Body of the la&s;t
lies in a Coffin, like tho&s;e that are us'd in <HI>France,</HI>
cover'd with a large piece of Tapi&s;try, with a
Turbant on his Head, in which there are two fine
<HI>Aigrets.</HI> In the <HI>Turb&eacute;</HI> of <HI>Amurat</HI> there are Ele|ven
of his Children plac'd round him, with two
of his Wives; and at the Head of the Coffin
there is a little Cupboard or Pre&s;s, where his Pra|yer-Books
are kept, which, are adorn'd with
Gold and Precious-Stones, appearing thro' a Lat|ten
Grate, and all <HI>Mu&s;&s;ulmen</HI> are permitted to read
there, for the Repo&s;e of the Souls of the deceas'd.
The Keepers of the <HI>Turb&eacute;</HI> are al&s;o oblig'd to pray
for 'em at certain Hours of the Day. This Sepul|chre
is not very magnificent.</P>
<P>Having &s;een all the above-mention'd places, we
return'd to <HI>Galata,</HI> re&s;olving to &s;pend another Day
in vi&s;iting the re&s;t of the Curio&s;ities at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI>

<HEAD>LETTER XIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THere are &s;o few Palaces or other remarkable
Buildings in <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> that in two Days
I compleated my Walk thro' the City; and the
Ob&s;ervations I made are &s;o incon&s;iderable, that I
&s;hall ea&s;ily be able to fini&s;h, in this Letter, the De|&s;cription
which I began in the la&s;t.</P>
<P>The <HI>Grand Signior&punc;s Ar&s;enal</HI> is at the End of the
Port, beyond <HI>Ca&s;&s;um Pacha</HI> and <HI>Galata.</HI> I found the
Building better than I expected, after what I had
&s;een in the re&s;t of the City; and be&s;ides, it con|tains
a con&s;iderable extent of Ground: The Gal|leys
are laid up under 120 Arches, and 'tis &s;aid
there are Arms in it for 60000 Men. But the
Magazins are inacce&s;&s;ible to <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> and they are
only permitted to &s;ee the Baths where the <HI>Sultan's</HI>
Slaves are &s;hut up; the Number of the&s;e Wretches
amounts to &s;everal Thou&s;ands; and their Lodgings
are &s;o mi&s;erable, that I repented the Curio&s;ity
that engag'd me in &s;o unplea&s;ant a Vi&s;it. The <HI>Cap|tain
Ba&s;&s;a</HI> lives in the <HI>Ar&s;enal,</HI> with all the Officers
of the <HI>Admiralty,</HI> that they may be always ready
upon the Spot to receive his Orders.</P>
<P><HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> is full of certain Hou&s;es, which the
Poverty and ill Cu&s;toms of the place have render'd
nece&s;&s;ary, I mean the <HI>Hans</HI> and <HI>Karavan&s;era&iuml;s.</HI>
The <HI>Hans</HI> con&s;i&s;t of four Sides of Building, enclo|&s;ing
a large &s;quare Court, in which there is al|ways
a Fountain, either in the mid&s;t, or in &s;ome
other part of it. The Walls are very &s;trong, and
the Windows well barr'd, to &s;ecure the Goods that
are laid in the Ware-Hou&s;es. The Roof con&s;i&s;ts
<PB N="161" REF="99">
of little Domes cover'd with Lead, like tho&s;e of the
Mo&s;quees. The&s;e Hou&s;es are appointed for the En|tertainment
of Foreign Merchants: They contain
only two Stories, divided into Rooms, which have
not the lea&s;t Communication with one another.
The lower Story is compos'd of Ware-Hou&s;es for
the Goods, and the upper is divided into little
Chambers, where the Merchants Lodge, but they
mu&s;t take care to furni&s;h them&s;elves with Beds, Pots,
Di&s;hes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for they are only accommodated here
with four bare Walls; and after they have provided
their Furniture, they mu&s;t buy their Meat at the
Market or <HI>Bazar,</HI> and Dre&s;s it them&s;elves, &s;ince o|therwi&s;e
they might &s;tarve with their Pockets full
of Money. And, in the general, the way of Tra|velling
in this Country is &s;o inconvenient and trou|ble&s;ome,
that this Con&s;ideration alone may &s;erve to
di&s;courage any Man that loves his Ea&s;e from vi&s;it|ing
it out of pure Curio&s;ity. For in the fir&s;t place you
mu&s;t neither expect Coach, Waggon, Boat, Hor&s;es,
nor any other convenient Carriage. If your Affairs
oblige you to undertake a Journey, tho' not above 100
Leagues, you mu&s;t wait three Months for a <HI>Caravan,</HI>
which, after all, will not Travel above four Leagues
a day, and carry no other Provi&s;ions but Rice,
Bisket, and Salt Beef, on which you mu&s;t make a
&s;hift to live, and encamp every Night till you ar|rive
at your Journies end, where, if you have not
the conveniency of Lodging with a particular Friend,
'twill be in vain to enquire for the <HI>King's-Head,</HI> the
<HI>White-Cro&s;s,</HI> or the <HI>Golden-Lyon:</HI> You mu&s;t e'en creep
into a <HI>Han</HI> with a hundred Wretches, who&s;e Bru|ti&s;hne&s;s
is altogether in&s;upportable, and reckon your
&s;elf happy when ye can find &s;uch a Lodging,
which, after all, is better than Encamping with the
<HI>Caravan.</HI></P>
<P>You will, perhaps, think it impo&s;&s;ible to repre&s;ent
a more frightful Idea of Travelling; but I can a&s;&s;ure
<PB N="162" REF="100">
you, that all the&s;e Inconveniencies are not compa|rable
to tho&s;e which they who Travel to <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> or
cro&s;s the De&s;arts of <HI>Arabia,</HI> mu&s;t re&s;olve to undergo.
They mu&s;t Travel &s;ix Months together expos'd to all
the Inconveniencies of bad Weather, and for the
mo&s;t part in burning Sand, where there is neither
a Stalk of Gra&s;s, nor a Spring to quench their
Thir&s;t. Be&s;ides, they are perpetually in danger of
being &s;urpriz'd by the <HI>Arabs,</HI> who rob and kill all
that come in their way. But all the&s;e Incommodi|ties
may be either more ea&s;ily avoided or &s;upported
than tho&s;e terrible Di&s;tempers that u&s;ually &s;eize <HI>Eu|ropean</HI>
Travellers, who are not accu&s;tom'd to &s;uch
hot Climates and fatiguing Journeys. I &s;hall take
this occa&s;ion to relate a Story of one of my Friends
who return'd, not long ago, from <HI>Poland,</HI> whither
he went about the beginning of the la&s;t Year by
the King's Order, in the quality of an Interpreter
with Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Chateauneuf's</HI> Chancellor, call'd
<HI>Beauche&s;ne.</HI> He was &s;eiz'd by the way with a vio|lent
Fever and Loo&s;ene&s;s, which brought him &s;o
low, and made him &s;o trouble&s;ome to the <HI>Caravan-Bachi,</HI>
or Captain of the <HI>Caravan,</HI> that his Com|panions
wou'd have left him to peri&s;h without a&s;&s;i|&s;tance,
if that Officer had not been afraid to run
the hazard of offending the Amba&s;&s;ador; yet he
a&s;&s;ur'd me that all their re&s;pect to Mon&s;ieur <HI>Chateau|neuf</HI>
cou'd not have protected him, if the Fever had
&s;eiz'd on his Head, and &s;o made him incapable of
&s;itting on Hor&s;eback. But the&s;e are not the only
di&s;advantages which Travellers &s;uffer in this Coun|try;
they are expos'd to a thou&s;and other vexatious
Accidents, and are con&s;tantly plagu'd with the
Bruti&s;h Humours of the <HI>Camel-drivers.</HI> We are
wont to complain of the Sawcine&s;s of Carriers and
Coach-men; but I a&s;&s;ure you they wou'd be reckon'd
very mild and tractable in this Country, where
every <HI>Camel-driver</HI> is as haughty as a Lord, and the
<PB N="163" REF="100">
poor Traveller mu&s;t keep in his Po&s;t under pain of
a <HI>Ba&s;tanado,</HI> which he mu&s;t take very patiently, for
if he &s;hou'd offer to return the Blow, I wou'd not
en&s;ure his Life for all the Money in the <HI>Caravan.</HI></P>
<P>I thought my &s;elf oblig'd to give you a faithful
Account of all the&s;e Inconveniencies, which mo&s;t
Travellers &s;tudy to conceal; that, if any of your
Friends have a mind to undertake the &s;ame Voyage,
they may at lea&s;t have the advantage of knowing
what they are to expect, which they cou'd not have
done if I had only given you a view of the plea&s;ant
and bright &s;ide of a Traveller's Entertainment. For
my part, I mu&s;t confe&s;s I had &s;o &s;trong an Inclina|tion
to <HI>Travelling,</HI> that I know not whether I &s;hou'd
have &s;topt on this &s;ide <HI>China,</HI> if I had not met with
&s;o many di&s;couraging Rubs: But my Curio&s;ity is
wonderfully abated of late, and I'm &s;o perfectly
cur'd of my gadding Humor, that I'm re&s;olv'd to
confine my &s;elf hereafter to <HI>Europe,</HI> and to Travel
only in &s;uch Places where I may find, at lea&s;t, a
piece of <HI>Beef,</HI> and a pair of clean <HI>Sheets</HI> at Night.</P>
<P>Since I had occa&s;ion to mention <HI>Beauche&s;ne's</HI> Jour|ney
to <HI>Poland,</HI> 'twill not be improper to give you a
&s;hort account of the cau&s;e of it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> being informed of the great Lo&s;&s;es
which the <HI>French</HI> &s;u&s;tain'd during the Campaign of
1689. and of the ill-fortune that attended His Ma|je&s;ty's
Arms in <HI>Flanders,</HI> where the Mare&s;chal <HI>D' Hu|miere</HI>
was un&s;ucce&s;sful in the only attempt he made,
began to give le&s;s credit to the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador's
&s;mooth Harangues, and to de&s;ire a Peace with the
Emperour. The Grand Vi&s;ier &s;poke of it &s;everal
times to Sir <HI>William Trumbal</HI> and Mon&s;ieur <HI>Collier,</HI>
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Amba&s;&s;adors, and &s;ent Orders
to His Ma&s;ter's Envoys at <HI>Vienna</HI> to ha&s;ten the de&s;ir'd
Accommodation. And certainly the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>
had rea&s;on to wi&s;h for a Peace, for his Affairs were
in a very hopele&s;s condition. At the beginning of
<PB N="164" REF="101">
the Campaign his Troops &s;uffer'd a con&s;iderable di&s;|advantage
in <HI>Croatia,</HI> where they lo&s;t above 2000
Men, with &s;everal En&s;igns, and the Ba&s;&s;a who Com|manded
'em. The Prince of <HI>Baden</HI> afterwards
Routed 'em thrice in three memorable Battels, and
they &s;aw them&s;elves expos'd to all the In&s;ults of the
Imperiali&s;ts, who talk'd of nothing le&s;s than of Be|&s;ieging
<HI>Con&s;tantinople. Teme&s;waer, Cani&s;&s;a,</HI> and <HI>Wara|din,</HI>
the only places they po&s;&s;e&s;t in <HI>Hungary,</HI> were
clo&s;ely Block'd up without any hope of Relief.
Thus 'twas plainly the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Turks</HI> to ac|cept
of the Propo&s;als that were made by their Vi|ctorious
Enemies: But the King's Intere&s;t was on
this occa&s;ion directly oppo&s;ite to that of his Allies.
He dreaded the fatal con&s;equences of &s;uch a Re&s;o|lution
and left no means une&s;&s;ay'd to prevent its
taking effect. He cajol'd the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> more
than ever, and flatter'd him with the hope of ma|king
a &s;eparate Peace with the <HI>Polanders,</HI> &s;ince they
had already enter'd into a Negotiation with the
<HI>Tartars,</HI> and had &s;ent Deputies for that effect to
Count <HI>Tekeli,</HI> who was to perform the Office of a
Mediator between 'em. This Stratagem produc'd
the de&s;ir'd effect, and the <HI>Turk</HI> was the more ea&s;ily
deluded, becau&s;e he knew that not long before there
happen'd a &s;ort of Quarrel between the Courts of
<HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Vienna.</HI> For the Emperor had granted
his Protection to the <HI>Moldavians,</HI> and on that &s;core
was to receive the &s;ame Tribute which they for|merly
paid to the <HI>Turks.</HI> The King of <HI>Poland</HI> pre|tended
a right to that Province, as an ancient Fief
of his Crown: But the Emperor wou'd not give
him any &s;atisfaction, and even refus'd to an&s;wer the
<HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador's Remon&s;trances on that &s;ubject.
In the mean time the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;adors
at the Court of <HI>Poland,</HI> were not idle Spectators of
&s;o favourable a Juncture, they endeavour'd to fo|ment
the difference, and <HI>Beauche&s;ne</HI> was di&s;patch'd
<PB N="165" REF="101">
thither with &s;everal In&s;tructions both from the King
his Ma&s;ter, and from the <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier.</HI> But all their
Negotiations were un&s;ucce&s;sful, for they cou'd not
prevail with the King of <HI>Poland</HI> to break his Con|federacy
with the Emperor.</P>
<P>I will not trouble you with an Apology for the
length of this digre&s;&s;ion, into which the way of
Travelling in <HI>Turkey</HI> has in&s;en&s;ibly engag'd me.
For &s;ince at the beginning of our Corre&s;pondence
I re&s;olv'd to entertain you from time to time with
a familiar account, not only of my own Ob&s;erva|tions,
but of what I &s;hou'd learn from others; I
&s;ee no rea&s;on why the pro&s;ecution of that de&s;ign
&s;hou'd oblige me to a nice ob&s;ervance of an exact
and regular Method.</P>
<P>I have already told you, that there are two &s;orts
of <HI>Public Hou&s;es</HI> in <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> the <HI>Hans,</HI> and the
<HI>Karavan&s;era&iuml;s:</HI> And I &s;hall take this occa&s;ion to add
a &s;hort de&s;cription of the <HI>Second</HI> to the larger account
I gave you of the <HI>Fir&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>They are both built after the &s;ame manner, only
the <HI>Hans</HI> are enclos'd with good thick Walls, where|as
the Stone-work in the <HI>Karavan&s;era&iuml;s</HI> reaches no
higher than the fir&s;t or lower Story, the &s;econd be|ing
built of Wood, and cover'd with Bricks. They
have only one Gate, as well as the <HI>Hans,</HI> and &s;erve
to lodge poor Strangers, and the Servants of the
<HI>Caravans;</HI> for which rea&s;on they are call'd <HI>Kara|van&s;era&iuml;,</HI>
or the Hou&s;es of the <HI>Caravans.</HI> All Indi|gent
Per&s;ons re&s;ort to 'em, paying from half a
Crown, to a Crown a Month, according to the
finene&s;s of the Hou&s;e, or the advantages of its
Situation.</P>
<P>After we had taken a &s;light view of &s;everal of
the&s;e Hou&s;es, we went to the <HI>Grand Signior's Seraglio,</HI>
which I cannot de&s;cribe exactly, &s;ince I was not
&s;uffer'd to go further than the &s;econd Court, tho'
I was accompany'd by an <HI>Aga</HI> of the <HI>Jani&s;aries,</HI> to
<PB N="166" REF="102">
whom I had been effectually recommended, and
without who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance I mu&s;t have contented my
&s;elf with a view of the fir&s;t. The <HI>Seraglio</HI> is built
on a Point of Land that juts out into the Sea,
which I had occa&s;ion to mention when I de&s;crib'd
the &s;ituation of the City. 'Tis &s;urrounded with
high Walls of a greyi&s;h Stone, with a Parapet at
the top, and Battlements like tho&s;e of the City. It
contains a va&s;t extent of Ground, almo&s;t four Miles
in compa&s;s, the greate&s;t part of which is taken up
with Gardens. The Structure is irregular, and very
un&s;utable to the boa&s;ted Magnificence of its Ma&s;ter:
For 'tis only a va&s;t heap of Buildings not unlike to
&s;ome old Ca&s;tles in <HI>Chri&s;tendom;</HI> and you &s;ee no|thing
on the out&s;ide but a confus'd medley of
Hou&s;es, adorn'd with tho&s;e little gilt Spires and Globes
I mention'd in my la&s;t, in which all its Beauty con|&s;i&s;ts.
The re&s;t of the Building is &s;o mean, that a
Man wou'd never imagine it to be the <HI>Seraglio,</HI>
that admir'd Palace of the <HI>Grand Signior.</HI> The prin|cipal
Entry is near <HI>Sancta Sophia,</HI> and exactly re|&s;embles
the Gate of an old paltry Town, without
either Architecture or Ornament: Yet 'tis carefully
guarded by the <HI>Capigi,</HI> who keep their Court of
Guard under it, and &s;it on Benches of Stone. This
Gate led us into a large Court, where on the right
hand we ob&s;erv'd the Apartments for the Sick, with
large Matted <HI>Sopha</HI>'s along the Walls, where the
Di&s;eas'd Per&s;ons are plac'd, and lodg'd as poorly as
if they were in a Ho&s;pital. On the left hand are
Magazines containing Arms for a Thou&s;and Men,
that in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> may arm
his Dome&s;tic Servants for the &s;ecurity of his Per&s;on.
But notwith&s;tanding this Precaution, <HI>Ibrahim</HI> was
Strangled, <HI>Mahomet</HI> Dethron'd, and <HI>Solyman</HI> Poi|&s;on'd,
not to mention the Tragical Ends of &s;o ma|ny
other Princes of the &s;ame Line, who&s;e Guards
cou'd not protect 'em from the fury of a Seditious
<PB N="167" REF="102">
Multitude. From this Court we pa&s;s'd into ano|ther,
border'd with two large Portico's. The <HI>Grand
Signior's</HI> Kitchens are on one &s;ide, which are not
kept very hot at pre&s;ent, &s;ince he chu&s;es to re&s;ide at
<HI>Adrianople:</HI> Yet I ob&s;erv'd &s;ome Per&s;ons preparing
<HI>Pilo, Pa&s;ties,</HI> and <HI>Fi&s;h,</HI> for the Women in the old <HI>Se|raglio.</HI>
On the other Side are the Stables, where
there is Room and Accommodation for a hundred
Hor&s;es. If your Curio&s;ity be not &s;atisfy'd with &s;o
imperfect an Account of &s;o famous a Place, you
mu&s;t con&s;ult tho&s;e who were permitted to enter
farther.</P>
<P>Very near this <HI>Seraglio,</HI> and within the &s;ame En|clo&s;ure,
there is another Edifice, commonly call'd
<HI>The Old Seraglio.</HI> 'Twas erected by one who was no
Lover of ill-contriv'd Structures, I mean <HI>Con&s;tantine
the Great;</HI> and yet 'tis certainly a very ugly Ma&s;s
of Building, &s;urrounded with Walls of an unu&s;ual
Heighth, without any Windows on the Out&s;ide. I
will not undertake to ju&s;tifie the De&s;ign of the
Founder, tho' we may be allow'd to &s;uppo&s;e that
he had &s;ome &s;ecret Rea&s;ons for contriving it after
this Manner. Be&s;ides I only &s;aw the Back of it,
and perhaps the Front may be more regularly built.
Here the reigning <HI>Sultan</HI> &s;huts up the Wives of his
Predece&s;&s;ours, who at their Entrance into this
Place may bid adieu to all the Plea&s;ures of this
Life.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent <HI>Sultan's</HI> Wives are lodg'd in a Third
<HI>Seraglio,</HI> which is join'd &s;o clo&s;e to that of the <HI>Grand
Signior,</HI> that he may pa&s;s from one to the other with|out
expo&s;ing him&s;elf to the Rain. I need not tell you
with what &s;everity they are guarded by the white and
black Eunuchs, who never permit 'em to enjoy the
lea&s;t Shadow of Liberty. All the Relations of Tra|vellers
are full of Stories and Reflexions on this Sub|ject,
and therefore in&s;tead of repeating the Ob&s;er|vations
of others, I &s;hall only add, that 'tis a Capi|tal
<PB N="168" REF="103">
Crime to look upon one of the&s;e Women. I &s;aw
a <HI>Turk</HI> at <HI>Galata</HI> who&s;e Father was &s;trangl'd for &s;o
dangerous a piece of Curio&s;ity, under the Reign of
<HI>Amurath,</HI> who&s;e Memory will not be ea&s;ily forgot|ten
in the Places that were &s;ubject to his Dominion;
for he was certainly one of the &s;evere&s;t and mo&s;t vi|gilant
Princes in the World. 'Twas his daily Cu|&s;tom
to walk in Di&s;gui&s;e thro' the City, that he
might be an Eye-witne&s;s of the Care that was ta|ken
to put the Laws in Execution; and he &s;eldom
or never walk'd the Rounds without leaving &s;ome
headle&s;s Monuments of his Ju&s;tice: be&s;ides he fre|quently
ob&s;erv'd what was done in the City from
his <HI>Seraglio,</HI> by the help of &s;ome excellent Pro&s;pe|ctive-Gla&s;&s;es,
with which the <HI>Venetians</HI> had pre&s;ented
him. One day as he was making his u&s;ual. Ob&s;ervations,
he perceiv'd a Man in <HI>Pera,</HI> who had al&s;o a Pro&s;pe|ctive-Gla&s;s,
and was viewing the <HI>Sultane&s;&s;es,</HI> who
were walking in the Garden. Immediately he call'd
a <HI>Capigi,</HI> and commanded him to go with four
<HI>Mutes</HI> to &s;uch a Hou&s;e, and hang a Man, whom
he de&s;crib'd, at the Window; which the <HI>Capigi</HI> ex|ecuted,
and <HI>Amurath</HI> &s;aw him and was &s;atis|fy'd.</P>
<P>From the Account I have given you of the <HI>Sul|tan</HI>'s
Palace, you may rea&s;onably conclude that the
great Officers of the Empire are but meanly lodg'd.
Mo&s;t of their Hou&s;es are inclos'd in a kind of Park,
which contains a Garden, and a large Court bor|der'd
with Stables on one &s;ide, and Kitchens on the
other. The fine&s;t I have yet &s;een is that of <HI>Haly
Ba&s;&s;a, Kaimacan</HI> of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> whither I attended
the Amba&s;&s;adour, when he receiv'd the fir&s;t Audi|ence
of that Mini&s;ter, which was perform'd with
the following Ceremonies.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t march'd &s;ixteen <HI>Livery-Men,</HI> in Red Coats,

la&s;t came the <HI>Amba&s;&s;adour,</HI> accompany'd with his <HI>Se|cretary,</HI>
and <HI>Chancellour,</HI> the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Per&s;ons
of the Nation marching &s;ome Paces after him. In
this Order he walk'd to <HI>Tophana,</HI> where he embark'd
with all his Train, the <HI>Kaimacan</HI> having &s;ent Boats
to attend him, and a very fine gilt one for him&s;elf,
with twelve Rowers. There were a con&s;iderable
number of <HI>French</HI> Ve&s;&s;els in the Port, who &s;aluted
him with all their Guns. At his Arrival on the o|ther
&s;ide he found his Led-Hor&s;es very richly har|na&s;s'd,
with Silver Bridles, and Embroider'd Foot-Cloths
trailing on the Ground. Immediately he
mounted his Hor&s;e, and all his Attendants falling in|to
the &s;ame Order, as before, he rode thro' the City
to the <HI>Kaimacan</HI>'s Hou&s;e, who &s;ent his <HI>Kiaia,</HI> to re|ceive
him at the Foot of the Stairs, accompany'd
with two other Officers, who led him under the
Arms to the Chamber of Audience, where there
was a kind of Chair with a Back, plac'd for him on the
<HI>Sopha:</HI> Immediately after the <HI>Kaimacan</HI> enter'd, and
&s;ate down upon the <HI>Sopha</HI> over-again&s;t him. At fir&s;t
the Di&s;cour&s;e was only general; but after &s;ome
Compliments to the <HI>Kaimacan</HI> on his late Promoti|on,
they began to talk of the pre&s;ent Po&s;ture of
Affairs: and that Mini&s;ter in&s;i&s;ted very long on the
<HI>Grand Vi&s;ier</HI>'s happy Succe&s;s in <HI>Hungary,</HI> informing
the Amba&s;&s;adour, that in le&s;s than two Months he
made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of the Cities of <HI>Ni&s;&s;a, Widin,
Semendria,</HI> and <HI>Belgrade</HI> it &s;elf, which he took by
Storm after a Siege of eight Days, and put the
whole Garri&s;on to the Sword, except 300 Men who
made their E&s;cape. He related al&s;o the particular
Circum&s;tances of Count <HI>Tekeli</HI>'s Engagement with
4000 <HI>Tran&s;ylvanians,</HI> who were entirely routed,
&s;carce 200 of 'em e&s;caping, and General <HI>Heu&s;ter</HI>
<PB N="170" REF="105">
him&s;elf being taken Pri&s;oner. The Amba&s;&s;adour
receiv'd this agreeable News with the highe&s;t Marks
of Joy, and reply'd in the&s;e very Words, <HI>That it
&s;eem'd there was a Sympathy between the two Empires,
&s;ince while the Emperour his Ma&s;ter was triumphing over
their common Enemies beyond the</HI> Rhine, <HI>he had the Plea|&s;ure
to be inform'd of the Glorious Succe&s;s of his High|ne&s;s's
Arms in</HI> Hungary; adding, <HI>That this was cer|tainly
an Effect of that entire Corre&s;pondence which had
united the two Empires for &s;o long and uninterrupted a
Series of Years.</HI> The <HI>Kaimacan</HI> an&s;wer'd, <HI>That he had
taken delight in making the &s;ame Ob&s;ervation, and that
he lookt upon it as a happy Pre&s;age.</HI> Then the <HI>Am|ba&s;&s;adour</HI>
took occa&s;ion to intreat him <HI>to employ all
his Intere&s;t for the E&s;tabli&s;hment and Confirmation of an
Union that was of &s;uch high Importance for the Happi|ne&s;s
of both the Empires; for 'tis plain,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>that the
Intere&s;ts of both our Emperours are the &s;ame. They can|not
break the Union that links 'em together, without
weakening them&s;elves: and it ought to be acknowledg'd
as a Fundamental Maxim, That the Grandeur of the
Emperour my Ma&s;ter confirms that of his Highne&s;s, which
reciprocally contributes to the Glory and Safety of my Em|perour.</HI>
The <HI>Kaimacan</HI> reply'd as one who was of
the &s;ame Opinion; he &s;poke &s;everal times of an
<HI>Alliance</HI> between the two Emperours, adding, That
<HI>'twou'd not be the fir&s;t time the</HI> Ottoman <HI>and</HI> French
<HI>Armies had carry'd on the &s;ame De&s;ign, and even obey'd
the &s;ame Orders.</HI> But the <HI>Amba&s;&s;adour</HI> declin'd to re|turn
a po&s;itive An&s;wer, becau&s;e he could not rely
upon the Fidelity of all that were pre&s;ent, and
perhaps I was one of tho&s;e whom he doubted
mo&s;t, for they begin already to &s;u&s;pect my <HI>Catho|lici&s;m.</HI></P>
<P>Then putting &s;ome odoriferous Matter into a
Cen&s;er, they perfum'd his Head and Cloaths, hold|ing
a large Cloth or Napkin above him to keep the
Fumes from evaporating. After this Ceremony was
<PB N="171" REF="105">
over, they brought <HI>Coffee, Sherbet,</HI> and at la&s;t the
u&s;ual Pre&s;ents, con&s;i&s;ting of <HI>Twenty five Ve&s;ts,</HI> which
were laid before the <HI>Kaimacan.</HI> The fir&s;t was for
the <HI>Amba&s;&s;adour,</HI> and the re&s;t for his twenty four <HI>At|tendants,</HI>
who were call'd in Order by his <HI>Steward.</HI></P>
<P>According as our Names were call'd, we &s;tept
forwards to receive the <HI>Ve&s;ts</HI> from one of the <HI>Kai|macan</HI>'s
Officers, who fir&s;t &s;pread it before the <HI>Am|ba&s;&s;adour,</HI>
and then put it on our Shoulders. The&s;e
Ve&s;ts are &s;uch incon&s;iderable Trifles, that the pre|&s;enting
of 'em &s;eems rather an Affront than a Mark
of E&s;teem; for they are not worth above three
<HI>Half-Crowns</HI> a-piece. They are made of <HI>Cotton,</HI>
branch'd with a little <HI>Silk</HI> of &s;everal Colours, after
a very odd and phanta&s;tical Manner. The <HI>Amba&s;&s;a|dour</HI>'s
was not finer than the re&s;t, only &s;pangl'd here
and there with a little paltry <HI>Gold.</HI> I'm inform'd
that this Cu&s;tom of pre&s;enting <HI>Ve&s;ts</HI> is an u&s;ual Ce|remony
among the <HI>Turks,</HI> proceeding from their
extream De&s;ire of Pre&s;ents, which is the u&s;ual Foun|dation
of their Kindne&s;s and Affection: for 'twou'd
be reckon'd as ridiculous, as 'tis in vain, to endea|vour
to acquire their Friend&s;hip, or convince 'em of
the Sincerity of our Love by Prote&s;tations and other
Marks of Affection, if they be not accompany'd
with Pre&s;ents. I can a&s;&s;ure you that all my <HI>Turki&s;h</HI>
Acquaintances are of the &s;ame Humour: and this
Cu&s;tom prevails &s;o univer&s;ally that every one is ob|lig'd
to comply with it.</P>
<P>After we had receiv'd our Ve&s;ts, his <HI>Excellency</HI> re|tir'd
with the <HI>Kaimacan</HI> to a private Chamber, to
di&s;cour&s;e of &s;ecret Affairs. In the mean time we
had lei&s;ure to view the Apartments of the Hou&s;e,
which were all open'd to us; tho' we might have
contented our &s;elves with the Sight of one, &s;ince
there is no difference between 'em; and therefore
'twill be an ea&s;ie Task to gratifie your Curio&s;ity
with a De&s;cription of 'em. You mu&s;t not expect
<PB N="172" REF="106">
a long Catalogue of rare Pictures, magnificent Beds,
large Looking-Gla&s;&s;es, &s;ilver Tables, curious Hang|ings,
and other rich Furniture: for there are no
&s;uch Ornaments in the Hou&s;e. Four bare Walls,
a <HI>Plafond</HI> or Cieling, and a <HI>Sopha</HI> are all the Riches
and all the Beauty of their Rooms. 'Tis true their
Plafonds are very fine, and painted all over with
<HI>Cochineel, Gold,</HI> and <HI>Azure:</HI> their way of de&s;igning
is peculiar to them&s;elves, but its Oddne&s;s does not
make it le&s;s plea&s;ant; 'Tis a kind of <HI>More&s;co,</HI> the
Figures entering into one another, and appearing
the &s;ame on all &s;ides; and it mu&s;t be acknowledg'd
that the <HI>Turks</HI> have very fruitful Inventions, for, I
believe, there are a Million of &s;everal Sorts of Fi|gures.
The middle of the Plafond is u&s;ually richer
than the re&s;t, both in Gilding and Painting; but
'tis impo&s;&s;ible to make you comprehend either of
'em, unle&s;s you had &s;een &s;omething of a like Na|ture,
which, I believe, you never did, &s;ince there
is not one Room in <HI>France</HI> thus adorn'd. The Walls
are al&s;o cover'd with the &s;ame &s;ort of Paint in&s;tead
of Hangings: and as for the <HI>Sopha,</HI> I cannot repre|&s;ent
it better than as a Bench about two Foot high,
reaching from one end of the Chamber to the
other, on the Side next the Street, under the Win|dows,
which begin a Foot higher in the Wall: 'tis
always between ten and eleven Foot broad, and co|ver'd
with <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> or <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Tape&s;try; be&s;ides which
there are Mats laid along the Wall, 4 or 5 foot broad,
cover'd with Cloth or Velvet, and over the&s;e there are
large Cu&s;hions, &s;tuff'd with Hair or Wooll. The&s;e
Cu&s;hions in great Mens Hou&s;es are either curiou&s;ly
embroider'd, or made of a rich Cloth of Gold: and
'tis here that the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;it night and day cro&s;s-legg'd
like Taylors, &s;moaking <HI>Tabacco,</HI> and drinking <HI>Coffee,</HI>
without any other Diver&s;ion than playing with
Shells, and &s;ometimes a Game at <HI>Tric-trac,</HI> or the
<HI>Goo&s;e.</HI> But &s;ince I &s;hall have occa&s;ion hereafter to
<PB N="173" REF="106">
&s;peak of their Recreations, I &s;hall at pre&s;ent only
give you an Account of their Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>While the Amba&s;&s;adour was di&s;cour&s;ing in private
with the <HI>Kaimacan,</HI> I went down to the Garden,
which is not above 100 Paces long, and 60 broad:
the Walks are gravell'd, border'd in &s;ome places
with Orange-Trees, and in others with Fruit-Trees.
The &s;quare Beds in the Garden are not cut and bor|der'd
like our Flower-Plots, but only &s;eparated with
Divi&s;ions, and fill'd with Flowers, of which the
<HI>Turks</HI> are very curious. In the Middle there is a
pretty large Ba&s;on of Water, from the Centre
of which there ri&s;es a little Marble Spire, gilt
and painted after the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Manner, and ca&s;t|ing
forth Water thro' four Pipes. There are al&s;o
two other Ba&s;ons at each End of the Garden,
which are more remarkable for the peculiar Odd|ne&s;s
of their Structure, than for their Beauty. They
are fram'd almo&s;t like Centinels woodden Boxes,
only they are not quite &s;o deep, and there is a kind
of Chapiter on the Top, adorn'd with Gilding and
Figures. The In&s;ide is cut into the Form of Scal|lop-Shells,
on which the Water falling makes a great
number of little Ca&s;cades that run into a Ba&s;on,
and form another large Ca&s;cade, the Water of
which is receiv'd into a Sort of Tub or Vat, and
from thence thro' &s;everal Holes, runs into little Ca|nals
about the Breadth of four Fingers, cut out of
a large Marble Pavement that reaches from the&s;e
Fountains to the Ba&s;on in the Middle of the Gar|den.
The Pavement was contriv'd on purpo&s;e for
the Conveniency of cutting out the&s;e little winding
Canals, which forming a va&s;t number of regular
and very plea&s;ant Figures, fall at la&s;t into the great
Ba&s;on. This, Sir, is the be&s;t Account I can give
you of the <HI>Kaimacan</HI>'s Garden, which may &s;erve
for all the re&s;t I have hitherto had occa&s;ion to &s;ee,
&s;ince there is no great Difference between 'em. As
<PB N="174" REF="107">
for the Hou&s;e, 'tis a great Ma&s;s of Building, the
Front con&s;i&s;ting of a high and broad Stair-Ca&s;e divi|ded
by two Galleries that reach from one end of
the Hou&s;e to the other; and the whole is dawb'd
over very coar&s;ly with a &s;ort of Red and Green
Paint. Under the Stair-Ca&s;e there is a large &s;quare
Gate, that leads into a Court &s;urrounded with Gal|leries
like the fir&s;t, and &s;upported with woodden
Pillars. Here the <HI>Kaimacan's</HI> Servants lodge,
who&s;e number may amount to fifty or &s;ixty, all
cloath'd after the &s;ame manner, with a <HI>Cafetan</HI> or
white Coat, that covers 'em from Head to Foot.
From thence I went to view the Stables, which in
this Country is u&s;ually the be&s;t furni&s;h'd part of the
Hou&s;e; and in the&s;e I ob&s;erv'd forty good Hor&s;es.
After I had &s;atisfi'd my Curio&s;ity with a View of
all that was remarkable below, I went up again to
my Companions, and &s;ate drinking <HI>Sherbet,</HI> till the
<HI>Amba&s;&s;adour</HI> came out. The <HI>Kiaia</HI> accompany'd
him to the Foot of the Stairs, where he receiv'd
him at his coming, with the &s;ame Officers that &s;up|ported
him under the Arms; but the <HI>Kaimacan</HI>
came not out of his Chamber, which in my Opi|nion
was a little too &s;tately for a Per&s;on of his Cha|racter.
The <HI>Amba&s;&s;adour</HI> did not pull off his Hat,
either at his coming in or going out: not that he
&s;lighted the <HI>Kaimacan,</HI> but out of pure Compliance
to the Manners of the <HI>Turks,</HI> who never uncover
their Heads before Per&s;ons for whom they have
the lea&s;t Re&s;pect. I had forgot to tell you, that
when he enter'd the Chamber all the <HI>Kaimacan's</HI>
Servants bellow'd out thrice, <HI>Is alla Malec allec is
alla:</HI> and at his Departure he was &s;aluted with ano|ther
Hollow; which is the u&s;ual <HI>Welcome</HI> and <HI>Fare|well</HI>
of the <HI>Turks</HI> to Per&s;ons whom they intend to
treat with particular Marks of Honour. I am,</P>

<P>MY unexpected &s;tay in this City has procur'd

at the end of &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful a Campaign.
The <HI>Turks</HI> are &s;o puff'd up with the advantageous

Contempt and Hatred of the Imperiali&s;ts are &s;o ex|treamly

great a quantity of Booty which was brought from
<HI>Hungary,</HI> and is &s;old almo&s;t for nothing in this City,

<HI>Sorlaques,</HI> or <HI>Foot-Guards of the Body,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of,
old pick'd Soldiers who expect Preferment: They
wore tuck'd up Gowns, carrying their Bows in their
Left-hand, and Quivers on their Shoulders: Their
Caps were of Cloth, like tho&s;e of the <HI>Capigi,</HI> but
in&s;tead of a Cone they were only adorn'd with
Plumes of Feathers. A Thou&s;and <HI>Jani&s;aries</HI> march'd
after 'em, Clad in Red, with <HI>Zercola's</HI> on their
Head, made of a large piece of Felt a Foot broad,
which falls back on their Shoulders, with a Cone or
&s;harp point like that of the <HI>Capigi:</HI> Every one of
'em carri'd a great Reed or Cane, eight foot long
and three round, with an Ivory Ball on the top,
and their <HI>Aga</HI> walk'd before 'em.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jani&s;aries</HI> were follow'd by 500 <HI>Chiauox</HI>'s
which are <HI>Hor&s;e Guards,</HI> the la&s;t of 'em carrying the
Standards and Colours that were taken from the
<HI>Imperiali&s;ts.</HI> They had large Caps or Turbants a|bove
two Foot in circumference: They were very
well Mounted, and led by the <HI>Chiaoux-Bachi.</HI> After
'em march'd the <HI>Mutefaraca</HI>'s, who are a &s;ort of
Officers that never go to the War, almo&s;t like our
<HI>Reformades.</HI> Next came the <HI>Ki&s;ler Aga,</HI> accompani'd
by the <HI>White</HI> and <HI>Black Eunuchs,</HI> who walk'd on each
&s;ide of him, to Guard the <HI>Sultane&s;&s;es,</HI> who rode in
eight very fine Coaches, but cou'd not be &s;een by
rea&s;on of a piece of Silk with which the Gla&s;&s;es
were cover'd.</P>
<P>After them appear'd the unfortunate Prince <HI>Ma|homet</HI>
IV. who, with his two Sons, was plac'd in a
Coach clo&s;e barr'd like a Pri&s;on-Window, and
guarded by twelve <HI>Chiaoux</HI>'s. Immediately after
came the <HI>Sultan</HI>'s Great Officers, to the number of
above 200 Per&s;ons, all richly Cloath'd in Embroi|der'd
Ve&s;ts, and Turbants, enrich'd with precious
Stones: Their Hor&s;es were al&s;o adorn'd with Silver
Bridles, and very fine Foot Cloaths, either Embroi|der'd,
or of Cloth of Gold, trailing on the Ground.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="108">
The &s;even <HI>Vi&s;iers of the Bench</HI> brought up the Rear
of this Magnificent Troop, and were follow'd by the
<HI>Mufti,</HI> who was mounted on a white Hor&s;e (but not
&s;o &s;tately as the re&s;t) and attended by four Officers
on Foot. Then came the <HI>Selictar</HI> carrying the <HI>Grand
Signior</HI>'s Sword bare. At la&s;t the <HI>Sultan</HI> him&s;elf ap|pear'd
&s;eated in a triumphal Chariot, open on all
Sides, and cover'd all over with &s;ilver-gilt Plates,
enrich'd with counterfeit Jewels, which neverthe|le&s;s
ca&s;t a great Splendour. The Chariot was drawn
by Eight &s;potted Hor&s;es, cover'd with Red Velvet,
embroider'd with Gold, and adorn'd with gilt Buc|kles.
The In&s;ide of the Chariot was lin'd with Vel|vet
of the &s;ame Colour, embroider'd al&s;o with Gold;
and in it there was a little <HI>Sopha,</HI> with a large Cu&s;hi|on
of a very rich Stuff, on which the <HI>Sultan</HI> &s;ate.
This place of the Chariot was cover'd with a very
rich Canopy, like that of a Coach, and rais'd &s;o
high, that the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> might be ea&s;ily &s;een by
the Spectatours. He is about fifty Years old, of a
&s;evere A&s;pect, and no very fine Shape. He wore
a large <HI>Turbant,</HI> almo&s;t like that of the <HI>Chiaoux</HI>'s,
adorn'd with two very magnificent <HI>Aigrets,</HI> enrich'd
with precious Stones: His <HI>Ve&s;t</HI> was of a very fine Stuff
adorn'd with Pearls, but much inferiour to the Coat
that co&s;t Fifteen Millions, which the King puts
on when he receives Amba&s;&s;adours. About and af|ter
the Chair march'd a hundred <HI>Aga's</HI> on Foot,
with their Officers and Commanders; and in the
la&s;t place came Three hundred <HI>Spahi's.</HI></P>
<P>At Night there were great Illuminations in the
<HI>Seraglio</HI> and all the <HI>Mo&s;quees:</HI> and the People ex|pre&s;s'd
their Joy by Fea&s;ts, Bone-fires, and re|peated
Shouts, crying, without Intermi&s;&s;ion, <HI>Long
live our Emperour, the Re&s;torer of Monarchy, and the
Prophet's Darling.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mon&s;ieur de Chateauneuf,</HI> who omits no occa&s;ion of
plea&s;ing the <HI>Turks,</HI> gave 'em &s;o many and &s;o expen|&s;ive
<PB N="178" REF="109">
Marks of the Share he took in their Joy, that
his Charge cou'd not be much le&s;s than theirs.
His Palace was almo&s;t cover'd with Garlands of
Myrtle; and at Night almo&s;t all the People of <HI>Con|&s;tantinople</HI>
flock'd thither to admire the Beauty of his
Fire-Works. The <HI>French</HI> Ships &s;ignaliz'd their Zeal and
Affection to the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Intere&s;t, according to the Or|ders
they receiv'd from the Amba&s;&s;adour, both by the
Illuminations of which their Ma&s;ts and Ropes were
&s;o full, that they &s;eem'd at a di&s;tance to be on fire,
and by repeated Di&s;charges of their Artillery. Be|&s;ides
the Amba&s;&s;adour prepar'd a &s;plendid Fea&s;t for
&s;everal <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Lords; among whom was the Prince
of <HI>Moldavia:</HI> There were two Tables for twenty
Per&s;ons each, tho&s;e who &s;ate at one being enter|tain'd
by him&s;elf, and tho&s;e at the other by his Se|cretary
<HI>Pelleran.</HI> The Gue&s;ts were regal'd with all
imaginable Magnificence both at Dinner and Sup|per;
and two Fountains run Wine in the Court,
all the while the Fea&s;t la&s;ted, whither all the <HI>Rene|gado's,
Greeks,</HI> and <HI>Mariners,</HI> came to drink the
Healths of the <HI>Two Glorious Emperours,</HI> Lewis <HI>and</HI>
Solyman, <HI>ever Great, and ever Victorious,</HI> pronoun|cing
the Word <HI>Vivat,</HI> according to the Cu&s;tom of
the Country, with loud and repeated Acclamations,
which is the &s;ame thing with the <HI>Engli&s;h Huzza.</HI></P>
<P>But among all tho&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions of Joy, that
which &s;candaliz'd me mo&s;t, was a Pyramid of Fire,
forty Foot high, which burnt in the Court till the
Morning. For there was an Illumination on the
Top of it repre&s;enting on one Side the <HI>Arms of
France,</HI> and on the other, a <HI>Shield</HI> charg'd with <HI>Three
fiery Cre&s;cents.</HI> The <HI>Turks</HI> were extremely pleas'd
to &s;ee with how much Ardour the <HI>French</HI> e&s;pous'd
their Intere&s;ts; and &s;ince that time have look'd more
favourably upon our Countrymen than before. 'Tis
true that they have been of late &s;o much oblig'd to
<HI>France,</HI> that they might ju&s;tly be reckon'd the mo&s;t
<PB N="179" REF="109">
ungrateful People in the World, if they were not
&s;en&s;ible of &s;o many good Offices. For without in|&s;i&s;ting
on the powerful Diver&s;ion made by our For|ces
on the <HI>Rhine,</HI> which has contributed &s;o effectu|ally
to the Succe&s;s of their Arms; they have, to
my certain Knowledge, receiv'd Supplies of Money
from them, which, without pretending to deter|mine
the preci&s;e Sums, I can a&s;&s;ure you amount to a
very con&s;iderable Value; for it has been ob&s;erv'd
in Ships that brought 100000 <HI>Pia&s;ters,</HI> there were not
20000 for the u&s;e of the Merchants.</P>
<P>The Amba&s;&s;adour has the mo&s;t convenient way
that cou'd be de&s;ir'd, to receive the Sums that are
de&s;ign'd for &s;ecret Service: for all the Money that
comes over to the Merchants mu&s;t be carry'd to his
Hou&s;e, where the Owners mu&s;t afterwards receive
it; &s;o that People are not at all &s;urpriz'd, when at
the Arrival of a Ship they &s;ee Che&s;ts of Gold and
Silver carry'd to him. And be&s;ides, who knows
whether the King &s;ends not over Engineers, Gun|ners,
and Officers: I have &s;een &s;everal Per&s;ons of
that Character here, and I my &s;elf refus'd a Place
which <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Chateauneuf</HI> wou'd have given me
in a Company of <HI>French Granadiers,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of
200 Men, who are publickly levy'd in this City.</P>
<P>This puts me in Mind of a remarkable Accident
that happen'd lately at <HI>The&s;&s;alonica.</HI> Two <HI>Engineers</HI>
arriv'd in that Port, pretending to be <HI>French</HI> Gen|tlemen,
and that they travell'd purely out of Cu|rio&s;ity:
the <HI>Con&s;ul</HI> receiv'd 'em with the highe&s;t De|mon&s;trations
of Civility, and invited 'em to lodge at
his Hou&s;e; for 'tis the u&s;ual Cu&s;tom of all the <HI>Con&s;uls</HI>
in the <HI>Levant</HI> to &s;hew a great deal of Re&s;pect and
Kindne&s;s to Strangers that &s;eem to be Per&s;ons of
Note or Quality. But having other conceal'd De|&s;igns,
they addre&s;s'd them&s;elves two Days after their
Arrival, to a <HI>Greek</HI> that wore a <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ruggoman</HI>'s Cap,
and pray'd him to carry 'em to the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;&s;a,</HI> and to in|terpret
<PB N="180" REF="110">
for 'em, without acquainting the <HI>Con&s;ul.</HI>
The <HI>Greek,</HI> who was glad of any Opportunity to
earn Money, embrac'd their Propo&s;al very chear|fully,
and accompany'd 'em to the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI>'s Hou&s;e,
where they declar'd their Profe&s;&s;ion, and offer'd
him their Service, but without intimating in the lea&s;t
that they were willing to renounce their Religion.
The <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Officer receiv'd 'em very favourably,
and promis'd to recommend 'em to &s;ome Per&s;on at
<HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> who wou'd quickly procure 'em an Em|ployment
&s;uitable to their Inclinations. Thus they
return'd to the <HI>Con&s;ul</HI>'s Hou&s;e very well &s;atisfy'd
with the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI>'s Civility: but the Interpreter's Con|&s;cience
not permitting him to have a Hand in a&s;&s;i|&s;ting
the declar'd Enemies of his Religion, he di&s;co|ver'd
the whole Intrigue to the <HI>Con&s;ul,</HI> without con|cealing
the Arguments and earne&s;t Intreaties they
us'd to oblige him to Secre&s;ie. Immediately the
hone&s;t <HI>Con&s;ul</HI> believing that 'twou'd be an acceptable
Piece of Service both to God and the King, to pre|vent
the wicked De&s;igns of his Gue&s;ts, order'd 'em
to be apprehended, and &s;ent back to <HI>France</HI> in Fet|ters.
'Tis plain that his Intentions were good, and
that he could not be ju&s;tly blam'd for taking that
Cour&s;e; but he quickly found, to his Co&s;t, that
they had more potent Friends than he imagin'd, for
after they had made their Complaints, he receiv'd a
&s;evere Reprimand from the Marque&s;s <HI>de Seignelay,</HI>
and was in danger of being turn'd out of his
Office.</P>
<P>The Number of <HI>De&s;erters</HI> that come over to the
<HI>Turks</HI> is almo&s;t incredible. There are at pre&s;ent &s;o
many of 'em in the Service, that there might be
&s;everal compleat <HI>French</HI> Regiments in the <HI>Ottoman</HI>
Army. I know that &s;uch a De&s;ign has been &s;everal
times propos'd to the Amba&s;&s;adour by the <HI>Grand Vi|&s;ier,
Kopergli Oglou,</HI> but the little Regard he &s;till pre|&s;erves
to the external Rules of Decency, has hither|to
<PB N="181" REF="110">
to re&s;train'd him from giving his Con&s;ent. Neither
do I &s;ee any Rea&s;on why the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;hou'd be offen|ded
at his &s;eeming Nicene&s;s, &s;ince 'tis not at all pre|judicial
to their Intere&s;t: For while their main De&s;ign
is &s;erv'd, they may very well di&s;pen&s;e with a needle&s;s
Piece of Formality, and the <HI>French</HI> Soldiers fight as
well when they are di&s;pers'd among the <HI>Ottoman</HI>
Troops, as if they were all united in a di&s;tinct
Body. That which allures 'em to come over in
&s;uch va&s;t Numbers, is the favourable Treatment
they receive at their Arrival: about eight Days ago
I &s;aw a hundred and fifty of 'em march thro' this
City, with Drums beating, and Colours flying, I
mean a Piece of White Cloth, which in this Coun|trey,
as well as upon the Sea, is reckon'd the Ban|ner
of <HI>France.</HI> Pri&s;oners of all Nations, except the
<HI>Germans,</HI> enjoy the &s;ame Priviledges, provided they
claim his Maje&s;ty's Protection. 'Tis true there are
&s;everal pretended De&s;erters, who carry on their hid|den
De&s;igns under &s;o &s;pecious a Di&s;gui&s;e: Nor have
the <HI>Turks</HI> yet learn'd Circum&s;pection, tho' they have
been &s;o often deceiv'd. I cou'd tell you twenty
Stories of this Nature, but I &s;hall content my &s;elf
with relating one In&s;tance, to convince you that
the <HI>Emperour</HI> has as good <HI>Spies</HI> as the King of
<HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>About the End of the la&s;t Year, immediately af|ter
the Death of the Amba&s;&s;adour <HI>Girardin,</HI> one
<HI>Vanel</HI> came over as a De&s;erter to the <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier</HI>'s
Army in <HI>Hungary,</HI> pretending to be a <HI>French</HI> Gentle|man,
who was taken Pri&s;oner on the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and
forc'd to &s;erve as a <HI>Voluntier</HI> in the Emperour's Ar|my,
which he left, a&s;&s;oon as he found a favourable
Occa&s;ion to make his E&s;cape. But not contenting
him&s;elf to remain as a Spy in the Army, he had
the Confidence to a&s;&s;ume the Character of <HI>Agent of
France,</HI> till the Arrival of the Amba&s;&s;adour
whom the King had nam'd. The <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier</HI> &s;ee|ing
<PB N="182" REF="111">
a Man who&s;e very a&s;pect &s;eem'd to an&s;wer for
his Hone&s;ty; and be&s;ides, perceiving that he made
a great Figure, was &s;o far from &s;u&s;pecting him, that
he own'd him as Agent: So that during the whole
Winter he manag'd the King's Affairs with as much
Authority as if he had been empower'd with a
Commi&s;&s;ion from <HI>Ver&s;ailles.</HI> 'Tis true, he &s;eem'd
to be very jealous of the Honour and Intere&s;t of
the Nation; but in private he endeavour'd to per|&s;wade
the <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier</HI> that the only way to pre&s;erve
the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, was to ha&s;ten the conclu&s;ion
of a Peace with the Emperour; and in the mean
time he found out ways to acquaint the Court of
<HI>Vienna</HI> with all the Tran&s;actions at the <HI>Port.</HI></P>
<P>This cunning Spy had the Art to play &s;o difficult
a Game with &s;o much dexterity and &s;ucce&s;s, that he
gain'd the e&s;teem and affection both of the <HI>Grand
Vi&s;ier</HI> and <HI>Sultan,</HI> from whom he receiv'd con&s;idera|ble
Pre&s;ents. And even the <HI>French</HI> had at la&s;t &s;o
good an Opinion of him, that they &s;crupl'd not to
addre&s;s them&s;elves to him on all occa&s;ions, as they
wou'd have done to an Amba&s;&s;ador. So that he
thought his Credit &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed, that he might
boldly expect the arrival of Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Chateauneuf,</HI>
who was coming to per&s;wade the <HI>Vi&s;ier</HI> to continue
the War again&s;t the Empire. <HI>Vanel</HI> went to meet
him a days Journey beyond <HI>Sophia,</HI> and told him,
that &s;ince Fortune had engag'd him in the <HI>Ottoman</HI>
Service, during the Vacancy of the Emba&s;&s;y, he
thought him&s;elf oblig'd by the Honour he had to
be a <HI>French</HI> Gentleman, to do what Service he cou'd
to the Nation, as he had actually done for &s;everal
Months, and was ready to give him an exact ac|count
of all his Proceedings. Afterwards he went
with the Amba&s;&s;ador to the <HI>Vi&s;ier,</HI> who gave him &s;o
favourable a Character, that Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Chateauneuf</HI>
either did not, or &s;eem'd not to doubt of his Zeal
and Affection to the King's Service. However, 'tis
<PB N="183" REF="111">
probable, that he was not entirely &s;atisfi'd with his
Conduct, and that he wrote to &s;everal Places for
better Information concerning him. For having
one Evening receiv'd a Pacquet in <HI>Vanel</HI>'s Pre&s;ence,
that &s;ubtle Spy fearing that the Intelligence might
concern him, adventur'd to peep over the Amba&s;&s;a|dor's
Shoulder, while he was reading the Letters,
and perceiving that they gave a very &s;u&s;picious Ac|count
of him, he re&s;olv'd to prevent the danger that
threaten'd him by a &s;udden Flight. Next Morning
he ro&s;e as &s;oon as the day began to appear, and went
immediately to one <HI>D' Etanchot,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Captain in
Count <HI>Teckely</HI>'s Troops, who was his intimate Friend:
He acco&s;ted him with a Melancholic Air, and in|treated
him to carry him to Count. <HI>Teckely</HI>'s Army,
where he had &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s to di&s;patch that requir'd
all po&s;&s;ible expedition. <HI>D' Etanchot</HI> reply'd, That
he was ready to &s;erve him, and that he would im|mediately
go along with him after he had receiv'd
the Amba&s;&s;ador's Orders. <HI>Vanel,</HI> who dreaded no|thing
more than the di&s;covery of his De&s;ign, con|jur'd
his Friend not to in&s;i&s;t on that piece of For|mality;
and to engage him the more effectually to
comply with his De&s;ires, he offer'd him 1000 Pi|&s;toles,
promi&s;ing to give him as much more at the
end of his Journey. <HI>D' Etanchot</HI> was extreamly &s;ur|priz'd
at his Earne&s;tne&s;s and Impatience, and per|ceiv'd
by the great Offers he made him, that the
bu&s;ine&s;s was of greater Importance than at fir&s;t he
imagin'd: His Fidelity to his Prince was &s;tronger
than his Affection to his Friend, and at la&s;t he told
him plainly, that he wou'd not go with him unle&s;s
he wou'd &s;uffer him to ask the Amba&s;&s;ador's Per|mi&s;&s;ion
before his departure. Then <HI>Vanel</HI> &s;eeing
him&s;elf di&s;cover'd, and fearing Torture more than
Death, which he knew was inavoidable, le&s;t he &s;hou'd
not be able to endure the extream violence of the
Pain, without divulging his Secret, he re&s;olv'd to be
<PB N="184" REF="112">
his own Executioner; and &s;uffering <HI>D' Etanchot</HI> to
walk &s;ome paces before him, without &s;peaking a
Word, he pull'd a Pi&s;tol out of his Pocket, charg'd
with three Bullets, and &s;hot him&s;elf thro' the Head.
His Friend &s;urpriz'd at the unexpected noi&s;e, look'd
back, and &s;eeing him lie groveling on the Ground,
and wallowing in his own Blood, run immediately
to acquaint the Amba&s;&s;ador with the Tragical Ac|cident,
who at fir&s;t cou'd not believe him, but af|terwards
&s;u&s;pecting him to be the Murderer, or|der'd
him to be &s;ecur'd: Then he went with &s;everal
of his Servants, to the place where this unfortunate
Per&s;on lay, and finding him &s;till alive, tho' very
weak, he ask'd him, How he was; <HI>Optim&eacute;,</HI> reply'd
<HI>Vanel,</HI> for they us'd to di&s;cour&s;e in <HI>Latin.</HI> Then the
Amba&s;&s;ador enquir'd, who put him in that condi|tion,
<HI>I did,</HI> an&s;wer'd he: What mov'd you to
&s;uch an act, reply'd the Amba&s;&s;ador; <HI>Becau&s;e,</HI> &s;aid
he, <HI>I was weary of Life.</HI> Afterwards the Amba&s;&s;a|dor
ask'd him &s;everal Que&s;tions concerning the place
of his Birth, and his de&s;ign in coming hither, but
cou'd not obtain any &s;atisfactory An&s;wer; and
(which is hardly credible) he endur'd the mo&s;t ex|qui&s;itely
cruel Torments they cou'd invent, with|out
making the lea&s;t di&s;covery, and even was &s;o
little daunted, that while he lay under the extre|mity
of the Torture, <HI>'Tis in vain,</HI> &s;aid he to the
Amba&s;&s;ador, <HI>to torment me thus, you &s;hall never know
more than I have already told you.</HI> In &s;hort, he gave
&s;o many Marks of an invincible Courage and Re|&s;olution,
that I cou'd hardly forbear comparing
him to <HI>Socrates,</HI> or <HI>Minutius Scaevola,</HI> if I had not a
natural reluctancy to prai&s;e Men of his Profe&s;&s;ion.
Thus he died of his Wounds, and left no Papers of
con&s;equence, that cou'd di&s;cover his Intrigue: But
the Amba&s;&s;ador and his Men &s;eiz'd on ten or
twelve good Hor&s;es, and above 25000 Livres in
Gold that were found in his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>

to the <HI>Bad</HI> Weather we met with about eight days
ago, &s;ince it forc'd our Captain to &s;top at the fa|mous
I&s;land of <HI>Scio,</HI> where we &s;till continue.</P>
<P>The <HI>Greeks,</HI> and in general all the Chri&s;tian In|habitants,
enjoy &s;o many Priviledges, and retain
&s;o many Marks of their ancient Liberty, that if I
did not &s;ometimes &s;ee a <HI>Turbant,</HI> I &s;hou'd almo&s;t
forget that I am &s;till in <HI>Turkey.</HI> The whole com|pa&s;s
of the I&s;land does not amount to 100 Miles;
yet there are above 200 Churches in it, and at
<PB N="186" REF="113">
lea&s;t 30 Mona&s;teries belonging to the <HI>Greek</HI> and
<HI>Latin</HI> Chri&s;tians, who perform their &s;everal Rites
without the lea&s;t di&s;turbance. They are &s;uffer'd
to walk in Proce&s;&s;ion about the Streets, as in <HI>France;</HI>
tho' there is nothing more odious to the <HI>Turks</HI> than
that Ceremony: And which is &s;till more remark|able,
the <HI>Greeks,</HI> who, in all other parts of the <HI>Otto|man</HI>
Empire are reputed Slaves, live here under the
Protection of a Magi&s;trate, who has the Title of
<HI>Con&s;ul.</HI> This Happine&s;s, which ought to be &s;o
much the dearer to the <HI>Greeks</HI> of this I&s;land, be|cau&s;e
'tis peculiar to them&s;elves, is only a continu|ation
of the Favours be&s;tow'd on 'em by <HI>Mahomet</HI> II.
when he made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of <HI>Greece.</HI> For the
<HI>Sciots</HI> perceiving that 'twou'd be in vain to re&s;i&s;t
an Enemy who had lately taken <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> from
the <HI>Palaeologi,</HI> and was &s;till Victorious in all his At|tempts,
re&s;olv'd to mitigate his Fury by a volun|tary
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and own'd them&s;elves his Subjects,
perhaps before he thought of Attaking 'em. <HI>Mahomet</HI>
was &s;o well &s;atisfi'd with this Mark of their Affection,
that he granted 'em &s;everal advantageous Privi|ledges
which they &s;till enjoy. For the <HI>Turks</HI> are
very Religious ob&s;ervers of their Promi&s;es to their
own Subjects; tho' they &s;cruple not to violate
Treaties concluded with Neighbouring Princes, e|&s;pecially
<HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> and <HI>Heretical Mahometans,</HI> &s;uch
as the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> of whom the <HI>Turks</HI> have almo&s;t as
bad an Opinion as the <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> have of <HI>Pro|te&s;tants;</HI>
becau&s;e the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> embrace the Doctrine
of one <HI>Haly,</HI> who pretended to reform the <HI>Maho|metan</HI>
Religion, as <HI>Luther</HI> and <HI>Calvin</HI> have Reform'd
the <HI>Chri&s;tian.</HI></P>
<P>At that time the I&s;land was po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by the <HI>Ju|&s;tiniani,</HI>
with the Title of a <HI>Principality,</HI> under the
Protection of the <HI>Genoe&s;e,</HI> who were then Ma&s;ters
of many fine Countries in <HI>Natolia,</HI> as it appears
by the E&s;cutcheons and Arms of the Republic,
<PB N="187" REF="113">
which are &s;till to be &s;een almo&s;t at every end of a
Field.</P>
<P>There is but one City in the I&s;land, and that
a very &s;mall one, tho' it has eight Gates. The
Streets are broad enough for Coaches; and the beau|ty
of the old Hou&s;es is a &s;ign of the richne&s;s and
&s;plendor of their ancient Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. The Ca&s;tle
is not much le&s;s than the City, and Commands
both that and the Port: Yet &s;ome Years ago the
Marquis <HI>Du Que&s;ne</HI> had the Courage to attack &s;ome
Pirates who retir<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">d under its Walls, and fir'd above
fifty Broad-&s;ides into the City, becau&s;e the Ba&s;&s;a
made a &s;hew of re&s;i&s;ting him. This attempt caus'd
&s;o great a Con&s;ternation among the Inhabitants,
that their fears continue even after the Marqui&s;s's
Death, and they &s;till tremble when they hear his
Name mention'd. The <HI>French</HI> are very proud of
this Expedition, tho' 'tis certain they have no great
rea&s;on to boa&s;t of it, &s;ince it co&s;t the Nation
100000 Crowns, which <HI>Fabre,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Agent,
pay'd to the <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier.</HI> This was, in my Opini|on,
a &s;ufficient reparation to the <HI>Turks;</HI> and there
was no Honour got by &s;o vigorous an Action, but
that which is due to the Memory of the brave Man
that perform'd it.</P>
<P>'Tis equally difficult to enter the Port, and to
get out of it, as our Captain has found to his co&s;t:
For the charge of maintaining the Ships Company
amounts at lea&s;t to 60 <HI>Livres</HI> a day, and I believe
he wou'd willingly give 30 <HI>Louis d' Ors</HI> to be at
Sea again.</P>
<P>The Government of <HI>Scio</HI> is a very con&s;iderable
Po&s;t, and the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI> is oftentimes advanc'd to the
Dignity of <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier.</HI> 'Tis not above a Year
&s;ince <HI>Kopergli Oglou</HI> was remov'd from this place, and
made <HI>Vi&s;ier</HI> after the Death of <HI>I&s;mael.</HI> He has un|der
him a <HI>Kiaia,</HI> a <HI>Kady,</HI> a <HI>Vaivoide,</HI> and a <HI>Receiver
of Cu&s;toms,</HI> as all other Ba&s;&s;a's have. The La&s;t of
<PB N="188" REF="114">
the&s;e Officers has more Employment here than in
mo&s;t other places, by rea&s;on of the <HI>Ma&s;tic</HI> that
grows in this I&s;land, better and more plentiful than
in any other part of the World. There are above
a Thou&s;and Che&s;ts of it gather'd every Year, each
of which contains Three Hundred Weight, and
the total Value amounts to above 200000 Crowns.
But the Inhabitants are not much enrich'd by &s;o
con&s;iderable a Trade: For they are not only oblig'd
to pay one half of the <HI>Ma&s;tic</HI> by way of Tribute,
but mu&s;t &s;ell the re&s;t at a very low rate to the Re|ceiver
of Cu&s;toms. 'Tis a white odoriferous
Gumm, that runs in the Spring out of little holes
which are made in the Bark of a &s;mall, weak, and
twining Shrub that creeps along the Ground, as
<HI>Vines</HI> wou'd do if they were not &s;upported.</P>
<P>I have not hitherto had occa&s;ion to &s;ee any re|markable
Church in this I&s;land, but that which is
call'd <HI>Niaomai:</HI> 'Tis a very ancient Building, and
adorn'd with a piece of <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> Work, like that of
<HI>Sancta Sophia.</HI> I will not trouble you with the Story
of its <HI>Miraculous Image,</HI> &s;ince all the&s;e Legends are
only the &s;ame Tale, repeated with &s;ome &s;mall alte|rations.
The <HI>Greeks</HI> believe and maintain the&s;e
Impo&s;tures with a great deal of Zeal; and even the
<HI>Turks</HI> who abhorr the <HI>Chri&s;tian Religion,</HI> wor&s;e than
<HI>Magic,</HI> are &s;ometimes cheated by 'em: For when
they hear that one of the Saints cures &s;uch a Di|&s;temper,
they procure Ma&s;&s;es to be &s;aid, and pre|&s;ent
Candles with as much Devotion as the mo&s;t Su|per&s;titious
<HI>Greek.</HI> I &s;hall take this occa&s;ion to re|late
an accident that happen'd not long ago in this
place; and perhaps you will not think your time
ill imploy'd in reading &s;o odd and diverting a
Story. You have doubtle&s;s heard of St. <HI>Anthony</HI> of
<HI>Padua,</HI> who is the <HI>Padrone Singularo</HI> of all the <HI>Ita|lians,</HI>
and has acquir'd &s;o great a Reputation of
working Miracles, that tho' he was a declar'd
<PB N="189" REF="114">
<HI>Papi&s;t,</HI> and more than that, a Monk of the Order
of St. <HI>Francis;</HI> the <HI>Greeks</HI> have plac'd him among
their <HI>Tutelar Saints,</HI> and &s;ing <HI>Kyrie Elei&s;on's</HI> to him
with as much Devotion as to St. <HI>Polycarp</HI> him&s;elf.
He has a Magnificent Chapel in this place, and in
it a Wooden Image, which is very well painted,
gilt, and crown'd, and wants neither <HI>He</HI> nor <HI>She</HI> Vota|ries
in abundance. His Miracles are the only &s;ub|ject
of the common Talk. Some own them&s;elves
oblig'd to him for Husbands, and others for Wives;
&s;ometimes he heals a broken Leg, and &s;aves others
from Ship-wrack; and, in a word, I know not
one Per&s;on here who has not receiv'd &s;ome Marks
of his Favour. 'Tis true, he's apt to grow &s;ullen,
and woe be to the poor Suppliants when little
<HI>St. Anthony</HI> takes the pet, for he'll e'en let 'em cry
their Eyes out, without deigning to take notice of
'em: However, there is no Di&s;ea&s;e without its Re|medy,
and a few &s;mart La&s;hes about the Shoul|ders
u&s;ually cures him of the <HI>Spleen.</HI> But when the
Di&s;temper is very &s;tubborn, and the Do&s;e of the
<HI>Whip</HI> proves ineffectual, they either turn him out of
his Lodging, and make him lie abroad in the Wind
and Rain, or dip him ten or twelve times in Water,
with a great Stone at his Neck, which always pro|duces
the de&s;ir'd effect, and makes the little Gen|tleman
as Complai&s;ant as they can wi&s;h. One of the
<HI>Turks</HI> in the Ca&s;tle, who had ventur'd all his Stock
on Board a <HI>Saique,</HI> and was afraid of lo&s;ing it either
by Storm or Piracy, re&s;olv'd to &s;teal <HI>St. Anthony,</HI> of
whom he had heard &s;o many Wonders, and either
by fair or foul means to make him pre&s;erve his
Goods. He waited &s;ome time for a convenient
opportunity to put his de&s;ign in execution; and
one day perceiving that there were none in the
Church but him&s;elf, he hid the miraculous Image
under his Ve&s;t, and carri'd it away undi&s;cover'd.
As &s;oon as he came home he &s;et it in the mo&s;t
<PB N="190" REF="115">
honourable Place of his Hou&s;e, adorn'd it with
Flowers, and kept two Wax Candles perpetually
burning before it; addreffing him&s;elf to it every
day with a great deal of Reverence, and humbly
acquainting it that his whole E&s;tate was on board
the Saique; and that the Lo&s;s of that wou'd en|tirely
ruine him and his Family. Thus he conti|nu'd
as long as he might rea&s;onably hope that the
Saique was &s;afe; but when the time was expir'd,
in which he expected to hear of its Return, he
took away the Flowers and Candles, and began to
treat the Image very roughly, beating it every day,
and threatning a wor&s;e U&s;age, if he &s;hou'd find
that it had neglected his Saique. <HI>Thou infamous Chri|&s;tian,</HI>
&s;aid he, <HI>think'&s;t thou to mock a</HI> Mu&s;ulman,
<HI>who&s;e Slave thou art not worthy to be? By</HI> Mahomet,
<HI>if thou do&s;t not re&s;tore my</HI> Saique, <HI>I'll beat thee to
Pieces.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time both the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romani&s;ts</HI>
were extremely griev'd for the Lo&s;s of their Saint:
and their Con&s;ternation was the greater, becau&s;e
they cou'd not imagine him to be &s;toll'n away, &s;ince
he was only made of Wood. The <HI>Cordeliers</HI> had
not the lea&s;t Share in the common Affliction; but
&s;ince they have an admirable Faculty of improving
every thing to the be&s;t Advantage, they declar'd
publickly that the Saint was not able longer to en|dure
the Coldne&s;s of the Peoples Devotion, and had
therefore withdrawn his Pre&s;ence from among 'em.
And even an old Father dream'd that S. <HI>Anthony</HI> ap|pear'd
to him, and &s;aid, <HI>My Son, I have left this
City, becau&s;e I was no longer able to be a Witne&s;s of
the Crimes that are daily committed in it, and the Want
of Love to God, and Zeal to his Service.</HI> The good
Man related his Dream to the People, and exhort|ed
'em to recall the Saint by Prayers, Vows, and
above all, by a great number of <HI>Ma&s;&s;es.</HI> At la&s;t the
<HI>Turk</HI> heard of the &s;afe Arrival of the <HI>Saique</HI> with
<PB N="191" REF="115">
his Goods, &s;o that thinking him&s;elf oblig'd in Con|&s;cience
to relea&s;e the Saint out of his Pri&s;on, he
carry'd him back with a great deal of Honour, and
told the whole Story. The Image was very joyfully
receiv'd by the <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> who look'd upon this as
a New Miracle; which re-kindl'd their Devotion
to &s;uch a Degree, that it can never be more ardent
than 'tis at pre&s;ent: the <HI>Turk</HI> al&s;o gave 100 <HI>Pia&s;ters,</HI>
as an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> Acknowledgment of the Favour he had re|ceiv'd,
and the Fathers order'd the Money to be
ca&s;t into a &s;ilver Chain, with which they fa&s;ten'd
the Image, to prevent its being &s;toll'n hereafter:
for they con&s;ider'd that People are always apt to
follow a bad Example, and that they might perhaps
mi&s;s their Saint when they &s;hou'd have mo&s;t need of
him.</P>
<P>This Accident has convinc'd me of a Truth I
cou'd never believe before, I mean that Super&s;ti|tion
may bear &s;uch an ab&s;olute Sway in the Minds
of tho&s;e who are under its Power, that even <HI>Turks</HI>
and <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> may join together in &s;ome Rites of
Devotion. I confe&s;s I was &s;o far from giving Cre|dit
to Relations of this Nature, that I could hardly
believe my own Eyes on a like Occa&s;ion at <HI>Lampe|du&s;a,</HI>
where we touch'd in our Voyage to <HI>Malta.</HI>
But &s;ince I am now of another Opinion, I &s;hall take
this Occa&s;ion to acquaint you with an Ob&s;ervation
I made there, which I dur&s;t not mention &s;o long as I
thought it impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>There is in that I&s;land a little Chapel dedicated to
the <HI>Virgin,</HI> in which there is an Altar, and a Coffin
with a <HI>Turbant</HI> laid upon it, which is u&s;ually call'd
<HI>Mahomet's Tomb.</HI> Both <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> have &s;o
great a Veneration for this Chapel, that they never
pa&s;s it by without leaving Money, Victuals, or &s;ome
other Offering. At our Arrival we found two large
and fre&s;h <HI>Pa&s;taiques,</HI> a <HI>Sequin</HI> of Gold, &s;ome &s;ilver
<HI>A&s;pers,</HI> and &s;mall Coin of <HI>Malta,</HI> to which our
<PB N="192" REF="116">
Captain added a <HI>French</HI> Piece of <HI>Three-pence half-peny.</HI>
Our Pilot told me that the&s;e Offerings were de|&s;ign'd
for the Relief of poor Slaves, who oftentimes
e&s;cap'd thither from <HI>Malta</HI> and <HI>Afric;</HI> adding that
the Place was &s;o Sacred and Miraculous that none
but Slaves dur&s;t take any of the&s;e things from the
Altar; or, if they did, that they could not po&s;&s;ibly
get out of the I&s;land. He related al&s;o &s;everal In|&s;tances
of the&s;e Miracles, but all his Arguments and
Stories could not hinder me from eating one of the
<HI>Pa&s;taiques;</HI> for the Weather was very hot, and you
know that tho&s;e who are not accu&s;tom'd to the Sea
are u&s;ually very de&s;irous of Fruit. To return to
<HI>Scio.</HI></P>
<P>I went t'other day to &s;ee a Place call'd the
<HI>Schools</HI> of <HI>Homer,</HI> tho' according to all probability
there were never any Schools in it. I incline rather
to believe that 'twas formerly a Place where Sacrifi|ces
were offer'd to the God <HI>Pan,</HI> or &s;ome other <HI>Ru|ral</HI>
Deity: for I &s;aw nothing but a &s;quare Altar cut
out of a Rock, on the Shore, with &s;ome decay'd
<HI>Ba&s;&s;o-Relievo's</HI> on the Sides, among which you may
di&s;tingui&s;h the Repre&s;entation of an <HI>Oxe, Wolf, Sbeep,</HI>
and <HI>Rabbet,</HI> be&s;ides &s;ome other Bea&s;ts which are le&s;s
di&s;tinct. Not far from thence I &s;aw a paltry Vil|lage,
where they a&s;&s;ur'd me <HI>Homer</HI> was born: but
<HI>Smyrna</HI> pretends a better Title to the Honour of be|ing
the Birth-place of that great Man.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erv'd nothing el&s;e remarkable in this I&s;land,
except their Manner of Living, which is extremely
free: for they give and receive Vi&s;its, make Enter|tainments,
and the Women &s;it at the Doors of the
Hou&s;es, and walk with Young Men to the Fields,
with as much Liberty as if they were in <HI>France.</HI> Be|&s;ides
they are of a very &s;ociable Humour, and any
<HI>Frenchman,</HI> who is Ma&s;ter of a tolerable Stock of
Wit, may quickly find a Mi&s;tre&s;s, and even &s;ome|times
an advantageous Match in this Place. For
<PB N="193" REF="116">
'tis the highe&s;t Ambition of the Women of this
I&s;land to marry a <HI>Frank;</HI> both becau&s;e they are na|turally
of a freer Temper than the Men of the
Country, and are not &s;ubject to the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI>
nor con&s;equently pay any Avanies, Taxes, or Im|po&s;ts;
which are two very con&s;iderable Advan|tages.</P>
<P>This is the only I&s;land in the <HI>Levant,</HI> where the
Cu&s;tom of wearing <HI>long Garments</HI> does not prevail:
for the <HI>Sciots</HI> retain'd the Fa&s;hion us'd by the <HI>Franks,</HI>
after their Subjection to the <HI>Turks.</HI> They &s;till u&s;e
Doublets or Wa&s;t-coats, Breeches, and Shooes; and
be&s;ides they wear their Hair long: but we have
chang'd &s;o many Fa&s;hions &s;ince that time, that they
who have &s;till kept that which was then in u&s;e
appear very ridiculous at pre&s;ent. Their Hats have
broad Brims, not cock'd up, and tapering Crowns,
&s;omewhat re&s;embling a Sugar-Loaf: the Sleeves of
their Doublets are wide and open, but clo&s;e at the
Wri&s;t: their Breeches are open below, edg'd with
Ribbons, and their Drawers appear under 'em: their
Shooes have large open Ears, and are &s;harp-pointed
at the Toe, as they were u&s;ually made in our Coun|try
about Twenty Years ago. The Womens Habit
is not different from that which is us'd by the Com|mon
People in <HI>Bretagne, Maine, Normandy,</HI> and
&s;ome other Parts of <HI>France.</HI> For they wear a kind
of &s;hort Ca&s;&s;ock, fa&s;ten'd with a Lace before, and
over that another of Silk Stuff, of which there is a
great deal made in the I&s;land. This Ca&s;&s;ock, which
the Maids of my Country wou'd call a Wa&s;te-coat,
reaches not below the Middle of the Thigh, and
the Sleeves which are not very long, are tied up a
little below the Bending of the Arm, for the Con|veniency
of wearing Silken Gloves, which are al&s;o
made in <HI>Scio,</HI> and are not unhand&s;ome. Be&s;ides
they have a kind of Petty-Coat, in which there
are (I believe) thirty Ells of Stuff, for 'tis pleited
<PB N="194" REF="117">
quite round, except on the Fore-part, and the&s;e
Foldings are all of an equal Depth, and &s;ew'd to|gether:
this Petty-coat is &s;o &s;hort, that it hides not
above one half of their Legs: and they are always
very careful to wear fine and tight Stockins, le&s;t
that which appears &s;hou'd give a Man an ill Opi|nion
of what is conceal'd. In their Head-Dre&s;s
they differ both from the <HI>Franks</HI> and <HI>Levantines;</HI> for
it con&s;i&s;ts only in a Piece of Cloth wrapp'd about
their Heads.</P>
<P>There are in this I&s;land &s;everal Families that pre|tend
to <HI>Nobility,</HI> and even &s;ome that draw their Pe|digree
from the <HI>Ju&s;tiniani;</HI> but their Education,
and Way of Living, is &s;o un&s;uitable to their
high Birth, that 'twou'd &s;eem altogether incredible,
if it were not atte&s;ted by all the Inhabitants of the

<P>The City is little, but extremely &s;trong, both by rea|&s;on

our <HI>Saviour</HI> and the <HI>Virgin,</HI> repre&s;ented over the
Door in <HI>Ba&s;s-Relief.</HI> Tho' I had not known that
this I&s;land belong'd formerly to the <HI>Knights</HI> of <HI>Mal|ta,</HI>
I &s;hou'd have ea&s;ily di&s;cover'd it by the great
number of In&s;criptions, and Scutcheons of the Or|der,
that are over the Gate of the City, and al|mo&s;t
every where el&s;e. And be&s;ides there are &s;o
many other ancient Monuments of the &s;ame Na|ture,
that I never &s;aw &s;o va&s;t a number of In|&s;criptions
in &s;o &s;mall a Spot of Ground.</P>
<P>'Tis related in the Hi&s;tory of the Order, that this
I&s;land was formerly infe&s;ted by a horrible Dragon,
<PB N="196" REF="118">
above thirty Foot long, who abode in a Cave not
far from the City, and made &s;uch a dreadful Ha|vock
all around, that there was no Safety in the
Country. The Story adds, that his very Breath in|fected
all the Neighbourhood of his Cave, and that
his Skin was &s;o hard, that no Arrow cou'd pierce
it, but that he was kill'd at la&s;t by a <HI>Knight</HI> of <HI>Pro|vence,</HI>
call'd <HI>Dedoat de Go&s;on.</HI> I always &s;u&s;pected the
Credit of this Relation, but mine Eyes have now
convinc'd me of the Truth of it: for the Mon&s;ter's
Head is on one of the Gates of the City towards
the Land, and I had time to take a full View of it.
I cannot repre&s;ent it better than by comparing it to
the Head of a Hog; only 'tis longer and bigger,
and hath no Ears; the Jaws are very large, and
arm'd with long and &s;harp Teeth.</P>
<P>Since I am not over-fond of believing any thing
that &s;eems &s;trange and unaccountable, I mu&s;t beg
leave to per&s;i&s;t in my Incredulity, concerning the
Famous <HI>Colo&s;&s;us,</HI> which was formerly the Glory and
Ornament of this I&s;land.</P>
<P>'Tis true, <HI>Strabo, Pliny,</HI> and &s;everal other Grave
Writers, &s;eem to believe this Story: but Authors as
well as other Men, take Plea&s;ure in relating Won|ders.
This was the u&s;ual Cu&s;tom of the Ancients,
e&s;pecially <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Herodotus,</HI> who have &s;tuff'd their
Writings with &s;uch lofty Fables, as the Reader may
ea&s;ily perceive by a tran&s;ient View of their Works.
And be&s;ides when an Author of any con&s;iderable
Reputation in the Learned World relates a Matter
of Fact, 'tis always confirm'd by the Te&s;timony of
tho&s;e who follow him. Neverthele&s;s in this Ca&s;e,
the Opinions of Authors are very different; for
<HI>Chares</HI> according to &s;ome, erected the <HI>Colo&s;&s;us,</HI> where|as
others a&s;cribe that Honour to <HI>Lacches:</HI> &s;ome with
<HI>Strabo</HI> relate, that 'twas <HI>&s;eventy Cubits</HI> high; and
others affirm that its Height amounted to <HI>Eighty;</HI>
&s;o that the Story is at the be&s;t doubtful and un|certain.
<PB N="197" REF="118">
But to examine the Matter more narrowly,
the large&s;t Computation of the Heighth of the <HI>Colo&s;&s;us</HI>
will hardly amount to what is requir'd by the Circum|&s;tances
of the Story: for the Breadth of the Port of
<HI>Rhodes,</HI> between the oppo&s;ite Shores, where the Feet of
the <HI>Colo&s;&s;us</HI> are &s;aid to have been fix'd, amounts to 324
mea&s;ur'd Feet, &s;o that the whole Figure mu&s;t have
been 500 Foot high. And be&s;ides how is it po&s;&s;ible
to conceive that a Ma&s;s of &s;uch a Prodigious Big|ne&s;s
cou'd be ca&s;t. I know &s;ome pretend that
'twas built by Pieces, and that it con&s;i&s;ted only of
Stone lin'd with Bra&s;s; but this Opinion as well as
the other is clogg'd with un&s;urmountable Difficul|ties,
as 'twill appear from the following Reflexions.</P>
<P>The talle&s;t of the <HI>Egyptian Pyramids,</HI> which are
ju&s;tly reckon'd among the <HI>Wonders of the World,</HI> cou'd
not be rais'd above 520 Foot high; and the Tower
of <HI>Strasburgh,</HI> which has not (and perhaps never
had) its equal in the World, does not exceed 560 Feet.
Now the&s;e admirable Buildings have &s;ufficient Ba&s;es
or Foundations, to &s;upport the Weight of the Su|per&s;tructure;
whereas this enormous Figure mu&s;t
have been four times bigger above than below,
without reck'ning the Arms that hung down, or
at lea&s;t one of 'em which carry'd a Lanthorn, and
(if the Story be true) could not be made but by
the <HI>Architects</HI> whom <HI>Ae&s;op</HI> &s;ent to King <HI>Nectanebus.</HI>
I will not in&s;i&s;t upon the equal poi&s;ing of &s;o great
a Ma&s;s, which was both ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, and ex|tremely
difficult in this Ca&s;e; but &s;hall proceed to
more obvious Rea&s;ons. 'Tis &s;aid that after this <HI>Co|lo&s;&s;us</HI>
was overthrown by an Earthquake, it remain'd
where it fell till the Year 656, or according to
others 952, which is a new Controver&s;ie; and that
the <HI>Saracens</HI> broke it to pieces, and &s;old the Bra&s;s to
a <HI>Jew,</HI> who carry'd it to <HI>Antioch.</HI> And here we
meet with another Variation in the Relations of Au|thors;
for tho' mo&s;t are agreed that 900 Camels
<PB N="198" REF="119">
were loaded with the Bra&s;s, there are &s;ome that re|duce
the Number to 800, but neither of the&s;e Opi|nions
is well grounded.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, I wou'd gladly be inform'd where the <HI>Co|lo&s;&s;us</HI>
fell; and they who maintain the Truth of this
Story, will perhaps find this to be a more puzzling
Que&s;tion than they imagine. For con&s;idering the
Situation of its Legs, they cannot pretend that it
fell towards the Land, and con&s;equently they mu&s;t
acknowledge that it tumbl'd into the Sea, where it
cou'd not lie without &s;topping the Mouth of the
Harbour; nor cou'd that be done without ruining
the Trade of the City, on which all its Riches de|pended.
But the&s;e nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equences of this
Suppo&s;ition, are directly contradicted by Hi&s;tory,
which a&s;&s;ures us, that <HI>Rhodes</HI> was a very flouri&s;hing
City, and that its Port was as good and as much
frequented, as ever, at the Arrival of the <HI>Sara|cens.</HI></P>
<P>But this is not the only Ab&s;urdity that de&s;troys
the Credit of the Story. Tis well known that a
Camel's Burthen never exceeds five or &s;ix hundred
Weight, e&s;pecially when the Journey is con&s;iderably
long: and how then cou'd 900 of tho&s;e Animals
carry away &s;o prodigious a Quantity of Bra&s;s. For
you will find by Calculation, that every Foot in
the Heighth of the <HI>Colo&s;&s;us,</HI> (reckoning 'em one
with another) weigh'd above 3000 Pounds; &s;ince
'tis computed that a &s;quare Foot of that Metal,
containing an Inch in Thickne&s;s, weighs above fifty
Pounds. Now 'tis plain, that the very encompa&s;|&s;ing
of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ody of the <HI>Colo&s;&s;us</HI> wou'd require much
more than &s;ixty &s;uch Pieces, which according to the
above-mention<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d Computation, amount to 1500
Pounds, without reckoning the Overplus; and by
the &s;ame Proportion you may gue&s;s at the
Quantity of Bra&s;s that wou'd have been nece&s;&s;ary
for lining the whole Figure.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="119">
This <HI>Colo&s;&s;us</HI> puts me in mind of the extravagant
Propo&s;al made to <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great by an Archi|tect
call'd <HI>Dinocrates,</HI> who undertook to build a City
on Mount <HI>Atlas,</HI> and to cut it into the Shape of a
Man, with a Cup in his Hand di&s;gorging a River.
Cou'd ever a more ridiculous <HI>Chimaera</HI> enter into a
di&s;temper'd Brain? But the Ancients cou'd ea&s;ily
&s;wallow the greate&s;t Ab&s;urdity, and there are &s;till
too many profe&s;s'd Adorers of tho&s;e fabulous Wri|ters,
who defend all their Lies and Mi&s;takes with a
&s;tupid Ob&s;tinacy. As for my part, I confe&s;s my
Faith is &s;o weak on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, that I cannot
forbear &s;u&s;pecting the Truth of the Story of the
<HI>Rhodian Colo&s;&s;us.</HI> At lea&s;t &s;ince I have &s;o much Com|plai&s;ance
to the Authors that atte&s;t it, as to keep
my &s;elf from denying it ab&s;olutely; I hope they
will give me leave to think that 'twas &s;omewhat
&s;maller, le&s;s wonderful, and &s;ituated in another
Place, than they imagine: for a much le&s;s incredi|ble
Bulk will &s;uffice, if we &s;uppo&s;e that 'twas
plac'd at the Mouth of the Harbour for Galleys.
However I dare not venture to a&s;&s;ure you that I have
&s;een the Place where the <HI>Colo&s;&s;us</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> &s;tood,
but only where 'tis believ'd it &s;tood: for thus I &s;hall
be &s;ure to keep clo&s;e to the Truth, which I have al|ways
made the Standard of my Relations.</P>
<P>We &s;tay'd part of a Day at <HI>Rhodes,</HI> and &s;et Sail
the &s;ame Night with a fair Wind; but a &s;udden
Change of Weather oblig'd us to &s;tand in to the
Road of <HI>Cyprus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cyprus</HI> is an I&s;land almo&s;t of the &s;ame Bigne&s;s
with <HI>Rhodes.</HI> The Air is &s;o &s;weet, clear, and tem|perate,
that the Weather is perpetually fair; at lea&s;t
I can a&s;&s;ure you, that during the little time we
&s;pent in it, I cou'd not perceive the lea&s;t Sign of
Winter. It produces great Abundance of Sugar,
Cotton, and delicious Wine: be&s;ides 'tis the be&s;t
Country in the World for Hunting, and Provi&s;ions
<PB N="200" REF="120">
are &s;o incredibly cheap, that, as the <HI>French Con&s;ul</HI> a&s;|&s;ur'd
me, the greate&s;t Lover of his Belly cannot
&s;pend Forty Pia&s;ters a Year in Eating and Drinking.
The Town is neither large nor neat, inhabited by a
Medley of <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> as all other Places
under the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s Dominion. I &s;aw a Man
in it that had four Arms, two on each Side, one
above the other, but he cou'd only u&s;e the lower.
The 27<HI>th.</HI> in the Morning we &s;et Sail, and arriv'd at
<HI>Alexandria</HI> on the 8<HI>th.</HI> in&s;tant towards Noon.</P>
<P>The Land lies &s;o extremely low, that tho' the
Sun &s;hone very bright, we cou'd not di&s;cover the
Coa&s;t, till we were very near it. At the &s;ame time
we perceiv'd a Saique making towards us, with a
Pilot and four Officers of the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e. Per|haps
mo&s;t of us wou'd have willingly di&s;pens'd with
the la&s;t of our Vi&s;itants; but we &s;tood very much
in need of the Pilot's Help, for both the Road and
Harbour are extremely dangerous, by rea&s;on of the
lurking Rocks that can hardly be avoided without
the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a Seaman of the Country. At
la&s;t having ca&s;t Anchor very happily, I went a-&s;hore
in the Saique. As I pa&s;s'd by the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e,
I was &s;omewhat &s;urpriz'd at the unu&s;ual Exactne&s;s
of the Officers; for they &s;earch'd me all over, and
even thru&s;t their Hands into my Breeches, to know
whether I had brought any Gold or Silver, which
pay a con&s;iderable Impo&s;t to the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> com|monly
call'd <HI>Gold-Duty.</HI> But I was much more &s;ur|priz'd
at Night, when they came to &s;hut us up like
&s;o many Pri&s;oners, as they do every Night in the
Week, and on <HI>Fridays</HI> at Noon; by rea&s;on of a
fooli&s;h Prophecy, that foretells the Conque&s;t of the
City by the <HI>Franks.</HI> For &s;ince 'twou'd be very trou|ble&s;ome
to &s;hut as many Doors as there are
<HI>Franks</HI> in the Town, all tho&s;e who bear that Name
are oblig'd to lodge in certain &s;pacious <HI>Hans,</HI> call'd
<HI>Fondies,</HI> which having but one Gate or Door, are
<PB N="201" REF="120">
quickly &s;ecur'd. The <HI>French, Engli&s;h,</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI>
have each a di&s;tinct <HI>Han,</HI> where they live, without
medling in the lea&s;t with one another's bu&s;ine&s;s,
either in Peace or War. The Merchants who re|&s;ide
here are for the mo&s;t part only Factors to an|&s;wer
the Commi&s;&s;ions of their Corre&s;pondents in
<HI>Chri&s;tendom:</HI> Nor can this City be reckon'd as a
place of Commerce, unle&s;s by the bye, for no con|&s;iderable
<HI>Caravans</HI> come hither, and <HI>Aleppo</HI> is pro|perly
the Seat of Trade, and Re&s;idence of the
Con&s;uls.</P>
<P>The famous City of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> admir'd in for|mer
Ages for its Extent and Beauty, is now a
wretched heap of Cottages, that &s;eem to have been
built on purpo&s;e to in&s;ult over the deplorable fate
of the Ruins on which they are founded. There
cannot be a more lively In&s;tance of the frailty of
human Grandeur, than tho&s;e rich Fragments of
<HI>Marble, Porphyry,</HI> and <HI>Granite,</HI> that are every where
to be &s;een mixt with Earth, Wood, and Stone.
The whole City is as it were buri'd under the Ruines
of overturn'd Palaces; and 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to be|hold
that magnificent Rubbi&s;h, without reflecting
with a certain Melancholic Plea&s;ure on the ancient
Splendor of the&s;e celebrated Structures. But &s;ince
I have rea&s;on to believe that &s;uch general Remarks
wou'd not &s;atisfie your Curio&s;ity, I &s;hall proceed to
give you a more particular account of the admi|rable
Remains of <HI>Alexandria.</HI></P>
<P>It appears by the Walls (which are not &s;o rui|nous
as the Hou&s;es) that the compa&s;s of the City
amounted to Ten Miles: But they are infinitely
more remarkable for their Beauty and Magnifi|cence,
than for the largene&s;s of their Extent.
They are 20 Foot thick throughout, and join'd
with a certain Cement as hard as Stone: From
&s;pace to &s;pace they are flank'd with great &s;quare
Towers, which are &s;o &s;trong and ma&s;&s;ive that they
<PB N="202" REF="121">
appear like &s;o many Ca&s;tles; and within each
Tower there are Ci&s;terns, Halls, and a &s;ufficient
number of Chambers to lodge at lea&s;t 100 Men.
But, which is &s;till more convenient and u&s;eful,
there are Ca&s;emates under the Walls round the
whole City, in which, together with the Towers,
there was room enough to lodge 50000 Men, who
were always ready either to appear in Arms on the
Walls in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, or to march upon occa|&s;ion
to any place in the City. The Walls are al&s;o
&s;urrounded with good Fal&s;e-brays, which are &s;till
entire; and if you add to the&s;e a broad, deep, and
well-lin'd Ditch, I think there cou'd not be more
de&s;ir'd in that Age, for the &s;ecurity and defence of
any City.</P>
<P>Among all the ruinous Beauties of <HI>Alexandria,</HI>
there is none more remarkable than <HI>Cae&s;ar's Palace.</HI>
'Twas certainly a very large Building, and if I may
be allow'd to judge of the re&s;t by the Front which
remains &s;till entire, I may venture to a&s;&s;ure you that
'twas a noble and compleat Work. I ob&s;erv'd al&s;o
&s;everal Columns of <HI>Pophyry</HI> and &s;potted <HI>Green Marble,</HI>
which heighten'd the Idea I had already conceiv'd
of its Magnificence. Near the&s;e &s;tately Ruines
there are others equal to 'em in all re&s;pects, and no
le&s;s rich in <HI>Porphyry</HI> and <HI>Granite,</HI> which are &s;aid to
be Fragments of the Ancient Palace of the <HI>Ptolomies:</HI>
Be&s;ides a great number of others as admirable as ei|ther
of the former. But 'tis &s;o long &s;ince the City
was demoli&s;h'd, and the confu&s;ion is &s;o great at pre|&s;ent,
that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for the mo&s;t curious Anti|quary
to di&s;tingui&s;h the Foundations of &s;o many
Palaces and Temples. The only entire pieces that
have e&s;cap'd the common Fate of the re&s;t, are the
<HI>Column of Pompey,</HI> and four <HI>Obelisks</HI> of <HI>Granite.</HI>
'Tis &s;aid the fir&s;t was erected by <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> to the Me|mory
of <HI>Pompey:</HI> Some think 'tis a kind of <HI>Marble,</HI>
but others incline rather to believe that 'twas built
<PB N="203" REF="121">
of <HI>melted Stone,</HI> ca&s;t in Moulds upon the place.
The latter Opinion &s;eems mo&s;t probable, for there
is not the lea&s;t piece of that Stone to be found in
any part of the World, and the Pillar is &s;o prodi|giou&s;ly
big and high, that it cou'd hardly be erected
without a Miracle. I know 'tis alledg'd by tho&s;e
who believe the Story of the <HI>Rhodian Colo&s;&s;us,</HI> that
the Ancients had the advantage of admirable Ma|chines
to rai&s;e &s;uch bulky Pieces: But I &s;hou'd
reckon my &s;elf extreamly oblig'd to the&s;e Gentle|men,
if they wou'd &s;how me any probable rea&s;on
why among &s;o great a variety of <HI>Egyptian</HI> Monu|ments
of Antiquity there is not one of <HI>Marble,</HI>
and by what an accountable accident the Stone
call'd <HI>Granite,</HI> which was then &s;o common, is now
grown &s;o &s;carce, that the mo&s;t curious Inquirers
into the Works of Nature cannot find the lea&s;t
Fragment of it; that was not employ'd in ancient
Structures. And even tho' I &s;hou'd &s;uppo&s;e with
my Adver&s;aries, that the Quarries out of which this
Stone was dug were by degrees &s;o entirely exhau|&s;ted,
that there is not the lea&s;t Foot&s;tep of 'em
left; and that Nature her &s;elf has lo&s;t &s;o much of
ancient Vigour and Fecundity, that &s;he is not able
to produce new ones: I may &s;till be allow'd to ask
why <HI>Granite</HI> was only us'd in Obelisks or Columns
of a prodigious bigne&s;s: For if it were really a &s;ort
of Stone or <HI>Marble,</HI> I &s;ee no rea&s;on why we might
not find &s;mall pieces of it, as well as of <HI>Porphyry,</HI>
and other precious kinds of <HI>Marble.</HI> The&s;e reflecti|ons,
in my Opinion, may &s;erve to confirm the
Hypothe&s;is of tho&s;e who believe that all the&s;e ad|mirable
Monuments were actually ca&s;t in a Mould:
And if they wou'd take the pains to view this Co|lumn
attentively, they wou'd &s;oon be convinc'd by
the te&s;timony of their own Eyes, that 'tis only a
kind of Cement, compos'd of Sand and calcin'd
Stone, not unlike to Mortar or Lime, which grew
<PB N="204" REF="122">
hard by degrees. I will not pretend to determine
by what Artifice tho&s;e ancient Workmen kept the
Cement from yielding or &s;liding till the Pillar was
compleated; tho' perhaps it might be probably
alledg'd, that they made a Mould of Stone or
Wood, be&s;mear'd on the In&s;ide with &s;ome fat or
unctuous Sub&s;tance, to hinder the Matter from
&s;ticking to its cover; and that after the Work was
fini&s;h'd, and the Column almo&s;t dry, they broke
the Mould that pre&s;erv'd the regularity of its Fi|gure,
and kept it from falling.</P>
<P>This Column is 80 Foot high, and 24 in com|pa&s;s:
'Tis plac'd on a Marble Pede&s;tal eight Foot
&s;quare, and crown'd at the top with a Chapiter of
the &s;ame <HI>Granite,</HI> of which the Pillar con&s;i&s;ts. I
know not what Opinion you may have of the An|cient
Engines, but for my part I mu&s;t confe&s;s,
whether I con&s;ider the weight or bulk of &s;o va&s;t a
Ma&s;s, I find it equally impo&s;&s;ible to conceive that
it cou'd be rais'd by the &s;tronge&s;t and be&s;t contriv'd
Machines that ever were Invented. The four <HI>Obe|lisks</HI>
are al&s;o of <HI>Granite,</HI> and adorn'd with Hiero|glyphic
Figures in <HI>Relief,</HI> like that at <HI>Rome:</HI> Some
of 'em are &s;tanding, and the re&s;t fall'n.</P>
<P>I cannot comprehend the rea&s;on that mov'd the
Founders of <HI>Alexandria</HI> to chu&s;e &s;uch an uninhabi|table
Country for the Seat of &s;o &s;tately a City.
The Heat is &s;o in&s;upportable in the Summer that it
makes all the Inhabitants as Tawny as they can po&s;|&s;ibly
be, without being quite Black. And, which
is &s;till more incommodious, they have no Foun|tains
to qualifie the &s;corching Heat of the Climate:
For the only Springs in <HI>Egypt</HI> are two that are at <HI>Cairo,</HI>
of which I may perhaps give you an account, after
I have &s;een 'em. To &s;upply, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the&s;e
natural defects, the Natives have contriv'd &s;ubter|raneous
Buildings, which are no le&s;s admirable than
the Palaces that formerly adorn'd <HI>Alexandria.</HI> For
<PB N="205" REF="122">
there are va&s;t Ci&s;terns under Ground, Vaulted and
under-prop'd with &s;trong <HI>Marble</HI>-Pillars that &s;up|port
the weight of the Hou&s;es, and of the City,
which is wholly built on the&s;e Caves. All the
Ci&s;terns are border'd with Streets, as if they were
Hou&s;es, &s;o that they &s;eem to form a &s;ubterraneous
City.</P>
<P>This puts me in mind of the <HI>Roman Catacombs,</HI>
tho' they are much inferiour in beauty to the <HI>A|lexandrian</HI>
Ci&s;terns: For the former are narrow, low,
and unadorn'd; whereas the latter are &s;pacious,
enrich'd with <HI>Marble,</HI> and in &s;ome parts with <HI>Por|phyry:</HI>
The&s;e Ci&s;terns were fill'd with Water at the
overflowing of the <HI>Nile,</HI> by a large Canal call'd
<HI>Khaalis,</HI> which &s;till brings Water from the River,
for the u&s;e of tho&s;e few Inhabitants that are left in
the City. The Canal is border'd with Gardens,
which are not beautiful, tho' they contain a va&s;t
number of very large <HI>Orange, Citron,</HI> and <HI>Limon</HI>-Trees.</P>
<P>If you reflect on the u&s;ual Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Romans,</HI>
to imitate the <HI>Egyptians</HI> in every thing, you will
find your &s;elf oblig'd to acknowledge that 'tis at lea&s;t
a probable conjecture, that the <HI>Catacombs</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI>
were built after the Model of certain large Caves,
without the Walls of this City towards the Palace.
The&s;e &s;ubterraneous Vaults are fifteen Foot &s;quare,
and eight or ten Foot high: And there are Tombs
in the Walls cut out of the Rock, like tho&s;e in the
<HI>Roman Catacombs,</HI> but more artificially contriv'd,
and rank'd in better Order, in which there are
many entire Skeletons, tho' tis perhaps above 2000
Years &s;ince they were laid there. The Entry of
the Caves is very low and narrow, for you mu&s;t
creep into a little hole, and &s;lide &s;everal paces
downward before you come to the Vaults.</P>
<P>This Country is Inhabited by a medley of &s;e|veral
Nations; natural <HI>Turks, Moors, Arabs, Greeks,</HI>
<PB N="206" REF="123">
and <HI>Jews.</HI> The <HI>Arabs</HI> are generally Free-booters,
infe&s;ting the Roads, and rifling all the Pa&s;&s;engers
without Mercy, &s;o that 'tis extreamly dangerous to
Travel without a numerous Company. Yet there
are &s;ome of that Nation who live in the Cities, and
are more Civil than their Country-men in the
Fields: But they all pretend to be Magicians, and
are &s;o intoxicated with &s;uch Chimera's, that one
wou'd almo&s;t think they were &s;eiz'd with a &s;ort of
Epidemical Madne&s;s. They have &s;everal ways of
Divination; for &s;ome of 'em pretend to <HI>In&s;piration,</HI>
others Prophecy by <HI>Vi&s;ions,</HI> and there are &s;ome who
throw <HI>Beans</HI> into a Bag, and after they have coun|ted
'em, return an&s;wers to tho&s;e who con&s;ult 'em.
Among all the&s;e Fortune-Tellers, tho&s;e who Divine
by way of <HI>Vi&s;ion,</HI> are reckon'd the mo&s;t skilful, and
are fewe&s;t in number: As for the re&s;t, the Streets
are full of 'em. I have heard &s;everal In&s;tances of
their Predictions, both in <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> and in this
Countrey, without giving Credit to any of 'em,
becau&s;e they were for the mo&s;t part only &s;econd|hand
Stories: But I'm extreamly puzl'd what to
think of an account I had from the Ma&s;ter of our
Ship, for my Author is a Man of Honour, and
part of the Matter of fact is atte&s;ted by all the
<HI>French-men</HI> in <HI>Alexandria.</HI> The Story is this.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Carbonneau,</HI> Ma&s;ter of the Ship, call'd
<HI>St. Augu&s;tin,</HI> bound for this City, was entru&s;ted at
<HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> with a Bag of 200 <HI>Pia&s;ters</HI> of <HI>Sevil,</HI> which
he receiv'd without counting 'em, and oblig'd him|&s;elf
to make good the Summ. At his Arrival he
deliver'd the Bag to the Per&s;on to whom it was
directed, who told the Money immediately, and
finding 50 <HI>Pia&s;ters</HI> wanting, refus'd to receive it,
and entred an Action again&s;t the Captain for the
Overplus. In the mean time <HI>Carbonneau</HI> made a
diligent &s;earch on Board his Ship, to di&s;cover who
had &s;toln the 50 <HI>Pia&s;ters;</HI> for he &s;u&s;pected his
<PB N="207" REF="123">
Clerk and Surgeon as the only Per&s;ons who had en|ter'd
his Chamber: But finding that all his Inquiries
were un&s;ucce&s;sful, he re&s;olv'd to con&s;ult an <HI>Arabian
Sooth-&s;ayer,</HI> who was of the <HI>Vi&s;ionary</HI> Tribe, and re|puted
very skilful. After &s;ome time &s;pent in Cere|monious
Grimaces, the <HI>Arab</HI> told him, that he &s;aw
a Man, who&s;e Per&s;on he de&s;crib'd, tell 150 <HI>Pia&s;ters</HI>
into a Bag of &s;trip'd Ticking, and afterwards tye
it up. The Captain perceiv'd that the&s;e Circum|&s;tances
agreed exactly to the Bag and the Per&s;on
who gave it him; but not being entirely &s;atisfi'd,
he entreated the Diviner to tell him po&s;itively, whe|ther
there were only 150 <HI>Pia&s;ters</HI> put into the Bag,
or 50 of 'em afterwards taken out. After &s;ome
new Ceremonies, the <HI>Sooth-&s;ayer</HI> told him, that he
&s;aw the &s;ame Per&s;on endeavour to put 200 <HI>Pia&s;ters</HI>
into the Bag, which not being large enough to
hold them all, there remain'd 20 that cou'd not be
put in for want of room. 'Tis plain then, added
he, that the compleat Summ neither was nor cou'd
be put into the Bag: And if you make the Expe|riment,
you'll be convinc'd of the truth of what
I &s;ay. Nor was he mi&s;taken, for 'twas found up|on
trial, that the Bag was not large enough to
contain 200 <HI>Pia&s;ters,</HI> and <HI>Carbonneau</HI>'s Adver&s;ary
was &s;o hone&s;t as to put a &s;top to the Action. This
accident made a great noi&s;e among tho&s;e of our
Nation; and the Captain was &s;o extreamly &s;ur|priz'd
at his Fortune-Teller's Skill, that &s;ome days
before his departure, he went again to con&s;ult him
concerning the Succe&s;s of his Voyage. The <HI>Arab</HI>
an&s;wer'd, that he &s;aw neither Fight, Ship-wrack,
nor Arrival, but only four Mariners, whom he
de&s;crib'd, carrying Fire in their hands; and there|fore
advis'd him to have an Eye upon 'em, and to
prevent any accidents that might happen in his Ve&s;|&s;el.
Six days after the Captain having put out to
Sea, and intending to &s;et Sail the next Morning,
<PB N="208" REF="124">
the four Seamen, whom the <HI>Arabian</HI> repre&s;ented,
&s;moaking Tabacco between the Decks, &s;et Fire to
&s;ome Bales of Wool that were part of the Lading,
and the Ship was entirely con&s;um'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arabians</HI> were formerly very Learned, e&s;pe|cially
in <HI>Medicine,</HI> and our <HI>European</HI> Surgeons have
found very u&s;eful Secrets in their Books: But at
pre&s;ent they apply them&s;elves wholly to Divination,
which, in their Opinion, is the only &s;ublime Sci|ence.
They are perfect Strangers to the knowledge
of Religion, and their only Trade is to Rob Pa&s;|&s;engers:
Neverthele&s;s, it mu&s;t be acknowledg'd to
their prai&s;e, that they kill none but <HI>Turks,</HI> and
the&s;e only when they are di&s;oblig'd by the <HI>Grand
Signior.</HI> They are divided into Tribes, commanded
by their particular <HI>Captains,</HI> who are all &s;ubject to
a kind of <HI>Duke</HI> or <HI>Prince,</HI> whom they call <HI>Skeick el
Kebir.</HI> They Encamp in the De&s;erts, where they
&s;pend their whole Lives; for when they have con|&s;um'd
the Gra&s;s in one place they remove to ano|ther.
They are lean and black; their A&s;pect is
Grim and terrible: They are u&s;ually cloath'd with
the Skins of wild Bea&s;ts, and feed upon Milk, But|ter,
Honey, and &s;ometimes a little Camel's Fle&s;h
parch'd in the Sun-Beams, or Roa&s;ted in the Em|bers:
But when they go out on Parties to Attack
<HI>Caravans,</HI> or private Travellers, they carry no
other Provi&s;ions but a little Fle&s;h, which they lay
under 'em upon their Hor&s;e's backs till it grows hot
and tender.</P>
<P>They have the be&s;t Hor&s;es in the World, for
they are incredibly &s;wift, and will ride a whole
day without tyring. 'Tis the Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Ara|bians</HI>
to Gallop perpetually, without &s;topping to
Dine: At Night they tye their Hor&s;es to Stakes,
and feed 'em with Milk, Fle&s;h, and Wheat, as they
do them&s;elves. They e&s;teem a good Hor&s;e above
all things in the World; and to prevent Deceits,
<PB N="209" REF="124">
they keep their Pedigrees in Writing. When they
have occa&s;ion to &s;ell or exchange a Hor&s;e, they
produce his Genealogy, proving him to be lineally
de&s;cended from &s;uch a Stallion and Mare of illu|&s;trious
Memory.</P>
<P>This wandring Nation owes the pre&s;ervation of
its Liberties to the weakne&s;s of the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI>
and of the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI>'s of <HI>Cairo</HI> and <HI>Aleppo,</HI> who not only
connive at 'em, but gratifie the <HI>Sheck el Kebir</HI> with
a Pen&s;ion, which very much re&s;embles Tribute;
For upon the lea&s;t delay of Payment, they burn and
pillage the Country in &s;o barbarous a manner, that
I cannot give you a livelier <HI>Idea</HI> of the havock they
make on &s;uch occa&s;ions, than by putting you in
mind of the <HI>French</HI> Campaign in the <HI>Palatinate.</HI></P>
<P>I have done with the <HI>Arabians,</HI> and &s;hall in the
next place proceed to give you a brief Account of
the <HI>Turks</HI> that live in <HI>Egypt,</HI> before I fini&s;h my Let|ter.
They are &s;o extreamly Super&s;titious, that
when they go abroad in the Morning, if the fir&s;t
Per&s;on they meet be a <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> they return im|mediately,
and having wa&s;h'd them&s;elves, &s;tay at
home all the re&s;t of the day; for they believe that
&s;ome great Misfortune wou'd certainly befall 'em,
if they &s;hou'd venture to go abroad again.</P>
<P>Their hatred and &s;corn to all that profe&s;s the
Faith of Chri&s;t, is extended even to the <HI>Franks,</HI>
who meet with a thou&s;and Indignities, which
the <HI>Greeks</HI> them&s;elves can hardly bear. For not to
mention the Cu&s;tom of Impri&s;oning us every Night,
we are not permitted to appear on Hor&s;eback in
the City, but are oblig'd to ride on A&s;&s;es; and if
a <HI>Frank</HI> were found taking a particular view of a
Fortification, 'twou'd co&s;t him at lea&s;t 500 <HI>Pia&s;ters,</HI>
and he might reckon him&s;elf very Fortunate if he
e&s;cap'd with &s;o mild a Correction. 'Tis &s;till a more
hainous Crime to enter into a Mo&s;quee, and wou'd
be puni&s;h'd with greater Severity: And therefore
<PB N="210" REF="125">
I hope you will not expect that I &s;hou'd acquaint
you whether the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Mo&s;quees are different
from tho&s;e of <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI></P>
<P>I have already told you, that the Men of this
Country are very black; but I'm inform'd, that the
Women are not tann'd in the lea&s;t with that Co|lour,
&s;o careful are they to pre&s;erve their Com|plexions,
and to keep them&s;elves out of the reach
of the Sun. I cou'd tell you &s;ome very diverting
Stories of the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Women, if I were fully
convinc'd of the truth of 'em. 'Tis true, my Au|thors
are very po&s;itive, but the Thing is &s;o odd, that
I dare hardly venture to relate it upon their Credit;
and e&s;pecially in this ca&s;e, I &s;hou'd be glad I cou'd
&s;peak as an Eye-witne&s;s. However, Sir, &s;ince the
mentioning of the Subject may perhaps rai&s;e your
Curio&s;ity, 'twou'd be ill Manners to take leave of
you without giving you &s;ome account of it.</P>
<P>I'm inform'd there are Schools here where Maids
learn to give and receive the Plea&s;ures of Love with
more than ordinary delight. This pretty Art is
taught by Women, who acting the part of Men,
make their fair Scholars exerci&s;e the mo&s;t la&s;civious
Po&s;tures imaginable. Maids of Quality are in|&s;tructed
at home, and I'm a&s;&s;ur'd that this is an
Accompli&s;hment which u&s;ually recommends young
Ladies to the mo&s;t advantageous Matches.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Cannot expre&s;s my Amazement at the &s;ight of
tho&s;e &s;tately Monuments that make <HI>Cairo</HI> the
mo&s;t admirable City in the World, and convince
the Beholder of &s;o many Wonders, that the ancient
Kings of <HI>Egypt</HI> were the mo&s;t powerful Monarchs
in the Univer&s;e. We are u&s;ually fill'd with a high
Idea of the <HI>Roman</HI> Grandeur, becau&s;e we view it at a
le&s;s di&s;tance: But how va&s;tly inferiour are the <HI>Pantheon,
Collie&s;eum, Capitol,</HI> and all the other celebrated Stru|ctures
of <HI>Rome,</HI> to the&s;e Magnificent Sepulchres
which have for &s;o many Ages &s;tood firm again&s;t all
the Attacks of Time and Age, and piercing the
Sky with their lofty Tops, &s;eem to be Copies of
the Tower of <HI>Babel.</HI> At lea&s;t 'tis plain, that the
Founders of the&s;e <HI>Egyptian</HI> Monuments were acted
by the &s;ame De&s;igns that mov'd <HI>Nimrod</HI> to erect
that famous Tower. They &s;aw that all things were
&s;ubject to the irre&s;i&s;tible Power of Fate, which de|&s;troys
in a Moment the mo&s;t illu&s;trious and potent
Empires, and annihilates even the Memory of their
Grandeur. Their Souls were too elevated to &s;ub|mit
to the common De&s;tiny of other Mortals; and
the &s;ublimity of their Courage in&s;pir'd 'em with
the noble and glorious Re&s;olution of making them|&s;elves
Immortal in &s;pite of Death. This was the
de&s;ign of tho&s;e <HI>Egyptian</HI> Hero's, and 'tis to their
Heroical Ambition that we owe the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
the&s;e Wonders of the World. How often do I wi&s;h
you had been an Eye-witne&s;s and Partaker of my
Happine&s;s, when I &s;tood gazing on &s;o many Beau|ties
that are not to be found any where el&s;e, and
<PB N="212" REF="126">
might ju&s;tifie the Curio&s;ity of a Traveller, tho' he
&s;hou'd come from the remote&s;t part of the Uni|ver&s;e
to admire 'em.</P>
<P>The&s;e Monuments are of &s;everal kinds, but there
are none &s;o admirably magnificent as the <HI>Pyramids,</HI>
which are &s;o highly celebrated by ancient Hi&s;tori|ans.
Two of the three principal Pyramids are &s;hut,
the other which appears bigge&s;t is open: 'Tis &s;eated
(I mean the la&s;t) very near the other two, three
Leagues from <HI>Cairo,</HI> if that name be confin'd to the
<HI>New</HI> City, or two Leagues and a half, taking in the
<HI>Old.</HI> 'Tis a va&s;t artificial Mountain, compos'd of
Free-Stones of different bigne&s;s; for we cannot
&s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible, that there cou'd have been a
&s;ufficient quantity of Stones found exactly of the
&s;ame Dimen&s;ions, for the building of &s;o prodigious
a Ma&s;s; but the &s;malle&s;t are a Foot thick, and
two Foot long; &s;ome being three Foot thick, &s;ix
long, and four broad. Its heighth amounts to
520 Feet, and the breadth of each Face to 682.</P>
<P>The A&s;cent con&s;i&s;ts of between 200 and 210 Steps.
The Top appears like the point of a Spire to tho&s;e
that are below; but when they go up to it, they
are &s;urpriz'd to find a Platform 24 Foot &s;quare;
and their Wonder is &s;till encreas'd, when they ob|&s;erve
that &s;o large a &s;pace is pav'd only with 12
Stones; for 'tis hardly conceivable how Stones of
that Bulk cou'd be rais'd to &s;o va&s;t a heighth.
From thence you have the Pro&s;pect of <HI>Boulac,</HI> old
and new <HI>Cairo,</HI> the Ruines of <HI>Memphis,</HI> the Moun|tain
and the De&s;arts of <HI>Egypt:</HI> But he who can
look to the bottom of the Steps without Amaze|ment,
may ju&s;tly boa&s;t of the &s;trength of his Head;
for my part, I mu&s;t confe&s;s I was &s;truck with &s;o
much horror when I ca&s;t my Eye downward, that
I was hardly &s;en&s;ible of any Plea&s;ure in viewing &s;o
great a variety of Objects. There were formerly
Steps on every &s;ide, but Time that con&s;umes all
<PB N="213" REF="126">
things has &s;o wa&s;ted &s;ome of the Stones, that in &s;e|veral
Parts there are dreadful Precipices; and
therefore Strangers dare not venture to a&s;cend with|out
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Guides that are acquainted
with the &s;afe&s;t ways. At the bottom of the Pyra|mid
there is a heap of Sand that reaches to the &s;ix|teenth
&s;tep, where there is a little door, thro' which
(after you have drunk a refre&s;hing Cup) you may
enter into a &s;ort of de&s;cending Alley, 30 paces
long, about three Foot and a half high, and of
equal breadth, &s;o that a Man cannot walk in it
without bowing his Body extreamly. At the end
of this Alley you mu&s;t lie down upon your Belly,
and creep thro' a little Wicket, which is even with
the Ground, and brings you into another little
Alley like the former, only in this you mu&s;t a&s;cend,
whereas you de&s;cended in the other. This Alley
ends in two others; that on the Right-hand has
no inclination, and leads to a little Vaulted Cham|ber
18 Foot long, and 12 broad. At the entrance
into this Alley there is a very deep Pit or Well
without Water: Some Travellers go down into it,
but I did not follow their Example: For I thought
I had already done enough to &s;atisfie my Curio&s;ity,
by creeping thro' tho&s;e Caves which are darker
than Hell it &s;elf, and in all re&s;pects a fit Habitation
for the Dead. Be&s;ides, they are &s;o full of Bats
that flutter about perpetually, and blow out the
Candles, that 'twou'd be very dangerous to venture
in without a Tinder-Box. Directly oppo&s;ite to the
la&s;t Alley, there is another which begins &s;o high in
the Wall, that we were forc'd to climb up to it;
but to make amends for that inconveniency, 'tis
much higher and broader than any of the re&s;t.
After I had walk'd 70 Paces, &s;till a&s;cending, I
found a &s;ort of Hall 32 Foot long, and 16 broad,
pav'd with nine Stones, the length of which is equal
to the breadth of the Room. The Walls are of
<PB N="214" REF="127">
a very fine and precious kind of <HI>Porphyry;</HI> and at
one end there is an empty Tomb of the &s;ame <HI>Por|phyry,</HI>
&s;even Foot long and three broad.</P>
<P>I went afterwards to take a view of the two
other Pyramids, the lea&s;t (and according to all ap|pearances
the mo&s;t ancient) of which was formerly
over-laid with <HI>Porphyry.</HI> 'Tis only 150 Foot high,
and each of its Sides or Faces is 200 Foot broad.
The common Opinion is, That 'twas Founded by
a Young Woman call'd <HI>Rhodope,</HI> who was <HI>Ae&s;op</HI>'s
Fellow-Slave in <HI>Egypt;</HI> and that the Munificence
of her Lovers enabl'd her to build &s;o va&s;t a Work.
The other is almo&s;t as great as the fir&s;t; for its
height amounts to 510 Feet, and the breadth of
each Face to 630. The&s;e three Pyramids are of a
quadrilateral Figure, and I ob&s;erv'd the Ruines of
an ancient Temple before each of 'em; for 'tis not
at all probable, that there were ever any Palaces in
that Place; and the huge <HI>Idol</HI> of Stone that &s;tands
very near tho&s;e decay'd Structures, is, I think, an
evident confirmation of the truth of my Con|jecture.
The People of the Country &s;ay, that
'twas heretofore famous for Oracles, and I believe
'tis no fabulous Tradition; for there is a very deep
Hole in the Head of the Idol, where the Prie&s;ts
might lie conceal'd, and return an&s;wers to tho&s;e
who came to propo&s;e Que&s;tions. 'Tis a <HI>Colo&s;&s;us</HI> cut
in the Rock, repre&s;enting a Woman, and is 26
Foot high, tho' it &s;carce reaches down to her Bo|&s;om,
&s;o that 'tis one of the mo&s;t mon&s;trous Figures
in the World.</P>
<P>Three hours Journey from thence there is a Vil|lage
call'd <HI>Sacara,</HI> in which there are <HI>Catacombs</HI> or
Sepulchral Vaults, but of a different Contrivance
from tho&s;e at <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Alexandria.</HI> For the&s;e are
di&s;tinct &s;ubterraneous Chambers, built of Free-Stone,
without the lea&s;t Communication between
one another: There is an opening above, thro'
<PB N="215" REF="127">
which you are either let down with a Rope, as into
a Well, or mu&s;t go down a Ladder, according to
the various Depth of the Caves. They were here|tofore
full of the Bodies of ancient <HI>Egyptians,</HI> &s;o
skilfully embalm'd, that they were pre&s;erv'd entire,
perhaps above 4000 Years, with their Epitaphs,
Coffins, and curious and magnificent Dre&s;&s;es. The
Coffins were enrich'd with <HI>Hieroglyphics,</HI> and the
Figure of the Deceas'd in <HI>Relievo;</HI> and &s;ometimes
there were Idols and Jewels found in 'em. But the
Curio&s;ity of the <HI>Franks</HI> has at la&s;t exhau&s;ted 'em;
tho' 'tis thought there are &s;ome that were never
open'd, and that the difficulty of finding 'em pro|ceeds
from the Avarice of the <HI>Moors,</HI> who only
know where they are, and keep the Price of &s;uch
Rarities very high. Yet I made 'em let me down
into two or three, where I &s;aw &s;ome Pieces of <HI>Mum|my,</HI>
but &s;o &s;poil'd, that 'twas impo&s;&s;ible to pre&s;erve
any of 'em.</P>
<P>This Place is &s;o full of <HI>Pyramids,</HI> that I believe
there are above a hundred; but they are not com|parable
to tho&s;e I mention'd. Yet I ob&s;erv'd one
that wou'd be as big as the fir&s;t, if it were fini&s;h'd:
there are al&s;o a&s;cending and de&s;cending Alleys in it,
at the end of which there are three Rooms in dif|ferent
Places. I will not trouble you with a De|&s;cription
of it, &s;ince the only remarkable Difference
between it and the fir&s;t, is, that this is only rais'd to
half the intended Heighth, if I may judge by its
Proportion to the re&s;t, whereas that is compleatly
fini&s;h'd.</P>
<P>On the other Side of the <HI>Nile,</HI> directly oppo&s;ite
to this Place, are the Ruines of the ancient City of
<HI>Memphis,</HI> extended along the River, till you come
overagain&s;t <HI>Old Cairo.</HI> They are &s;o confus'd at pre&s;ent,
that I &s;pent half a Day in viewing 'em, without
finding any thing remarkable.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="128">
I confe&s;s, Sir, that in pur&s;uance of the Niceties
of an exact Method, I &s;hou'd have made you ac|quainted
with the City of <HI>Cairo,</HI> before I had car|ry'd
you to vi&s;it the Rarities in its Neighbourhood.
But I cou'd not forbear giving the fir&s;t place to that
which I mo&s;t admir'd; and be&s;ides an Account of
<HI>Cairo</HI> will be as u&s;eful and perhaps as acceptable to
you at the End, as in the Beginning of my Let|ter.</P>
<P>The Ob&s;ervation I made concerning the Variety
of Opinions about the Extent of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> is
equally applicable to this City, which is divided in|to
three Parts, <HI>Boulac,</HI> and <HI>Old,</HI> and <HI>New Cairo.</HI>
Some Travellers &s;cruple to comprehend the&s;e three
Towns under one Name, becau&s;e they are &s;eparated
by Gardens and Fields: but if tho&s;e Gentlemen
were to write to an Inhabitant of any of the&s;e Di|vi&s;ions,
they wou'd certainly direct their Letters to
<HI>Cairo,</HI> and not to <HI>Boulac,</HI> &amp;c. And 'tis as imperti|nent
a Piece of Nicety to make a Di&s;tinction be|tween
Places that are divided by &s;o &s;mall a Di&s;tance;
as 'twou'd be ab&s;urd and improper, according to that
Opinion, to give the City the Title of <HI>Grand Cairo.</HI>
But not to trouble you with more Arguments, I
&s;hall only tell you that I think fit to join all the
three Parts together; and that in this Sen&s;e <HI>Cairo</HI>
contains four large Hours Journey in Length, and
twelve in Compa&s;s.</P>
<P>'Twas taken from the <HI>Soldans</HI> of <HI>Egypt, Ann.</HI> 1517.
by <HI>Sultan Selim</HI> I. who put to death all the <HI>Mamme|lucks</HI>
with their <HI>Soldan:</HI> and &s;ince that it has been
&s;till &s;ubject to the <HI>Turks,</HI> who in all probability will
not be &s;oon nor ea&s;ily driven out of it. 'Tis the
<HI>Metropolis</HI> of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Ba&s;&s;a|&s;hip
in <HI>Turkey:</HI> and &s;ince 'tis a City of a va&s;t Ex|tent,
the three Parts that compo&s;e it are differently
&s;ituated. <HI>Boulac</HI> is the Port of <HI>Cairo</HI> on the <HI>Nile,</HI>
and is alone as large as <HI>Rennes</HI> in <HI>Bretagne,</HI> or the
<PB N="217" REF="128">
<HI>Hague</HI> in <HI>Holland.</HI> The <HI>New</HI> City lies further in the
Country, at the Foot of a great Hill, and the <HI>Old
Cairo</HI> a little beyond it, on the Banks of the <HI>Nile.</HI>
Thus the <HI>New</HI> City is depriv'd of the advanta|geous
Neighbourhood of the River, and receives
all its Water by a <HI>Khaalis</HI> or Canal, like that of
<HI>Alexandria.</HI> All the re&s;t of the Cities of <HI>Egypt</HI> are
al&s;o furni&s;h'd with &s;uch Aqueducts, without which
they wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d be wholly de&s;titute of Water. This is
the Inconveniency, or rather the Mi&s;ery of the
Country; for the Heat is very trouble&s;ome during
the Summer: and &s;o much the more in&s;upportable,
becau&s;e all the Ground is cover'd with Sand, which
grows burning hot, and makes the Air &s;o &s;ultry,
that one can &s;carce breathe in it. Judge, Sir, what
a Plea&s;ure 'twou'd be in that Sea&s;on, to drink a
Cup of cold and fre&s;h Water; and yet the poor In|habitants
mu&s;t content them&s;elves with the na&s;ty
Puddle that has &s;tood about a Year in the Ci&s;terns,
or (which is almo&s;t as bad) with the Water that
is carry'd about the Streets to be &s;old in Pitchers
made of Goats Skins, by the <HI>Moors.</HI> For the <HI>Khaa|lis</HI>
is dry for the Space of &s;ix Months, and begins
not to be fill'd till the Month of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> when the
<HI>Nile</HI> is almo&s;t come to its greate&s;t Heighth. Then
they cut the Dam or Bank, that kept out the Wa|ter,
which immediately gu&s;hes into the Canal, and
continues to flow during the Encrea&s;e of the River,
that is, till near the End of <HI>October,</HI> after which it
decrea&s;es by degrees. The Day of the Opening of
the <HI>Khaalis</HI> is ob&s;erv'd in this City as a Fe&s;tival, with
extraordinary Marks of Joy: but &s;ince I have nei|ther
&s;een, nor am like to &s;ee that Ceremony, you
may con&s;ult &s;ome other Travellers for an Account
of it. The <HI>Khaalis</HI> pa&s;&s;es thro' the <HI>New</HI> City, and
fills a va&s;t number of Ci&s;terns and Ba&s;ons for Gar|dens.
The Inundation of the <HI>Nile</HI> is the only Cau&s;e
of the Fruitfulne&s;s of <HI>Egypt;</HI> for without that
<PB N="218" REF="129">
'twou'd be one va&s;t De&s;art, as tho&s;e Parts are, which
are depriv'd of that Advantage by rea&s;on of their
Di&s;tance from the River. The&s;e Floods, which are
occa&s;ion'd by the Melting of the Snow in the Moun|tains,
fatten the Soil more effectually than the be&s;t
Dung in the World cou'd po&s;&s;ibly do: and indeed
tho&s;e Spots of Ground that are wa&s;h'd by the Inun|dation
are admirably fertil. I cannot leave this Sub|ject
without taking Notice of the Vulgar Errour,
That it never <HI>rains</HI> in this Country; for during the
little time I have &s;pent in it, I have ob&s;erv'd &s;ome
Showers; tho' I mu&s;t confe&s;s it rains not &s;o frequent|ly
here as in other Countries.</P>
<P>The <HI>Nile</HI> is very near as broad as the <HI>Rhine:</HI> it
cro&s;&s;es the whole Country of <HI>Egypt;</HI> and during
the time of its Inundation, it overflows for the &s;pace
of two Months, all the neighbouring Fields, which
only are inhabited, the re&s;t of the Land being co|ver'd
with dry and burning Sands. It falls into the
<HI>Mediterranean</HI> by two Mouths, about 80 Miles di|&s;tant.
'Tis famous over all the World for its <HI>Cro|codiles,</HI>
and it mu&s;t be acknowledg'd that it contains
a great number of very large ones, but they are
neither venomous, nor &s;o terrible as they are u&s;u|ally
repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>If I &s;hou'd tell you that there are 23000 <HI>Mo&s;quees</HI>
in this City, you'd certainly laugh at my Credulity,
that cou'd &s;wallow &s;uch a mon&s;trous Fable. How|ever,
Sir, 'tis held by all the Inhabitants as a mo&s;t
certain Truth; and they are no le&s;s firmly per&s;ua|ded
that there are as many di&s;tinct Quarters or
Wards, containing &s;everal Streets each, according
to which Computation there are at lea&s;t 100000
<HI>Streets</HI> in the City. 'Tis true, they are extremely
&s;mall and narrow, but I dare not po&s;itively a&s;&s;ure
you that there is &s;uch a prodigious Number of 'em,
e&s;pecially &s;ince I never counted 'em. 'Tis al&s;o &s;aid
that when the Plague rages in this Place, it &s;weeps
<PB N="219" REF="129">
away 10000 Per&s;ons a-day; nor do I think this
Story &s;o incredible as the other: for the City is ex|tremely
populous, and there is as great a Concour&s;e
of People at the <HI>Bazar</HI> or Market every <HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> as
at the mo&s;t crowded Fairs in <HI>Europe.</HI> This <HI>Bazar</HI> is the
only to lerable Street in <HI>Cairo,</HI> and the <HI>Be&s;e&s;tin</HI> at one
of the Ends of it is at lea&s;t as fine and rich as that
of <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> At the other End there is a Market
of Slaves, where a Man may be always accommodated
with a pretty Girl, at the Rate of 100 or 150 <HI>Pi|a&s;ters.</HI>
All the Hou&s;es are of Wood, with Plat|forms
on the Top, after the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Fa&s;hion: The
Out&s;ide is as mean, as the In&s;ide is &s;aid to be beau|tiful.
'Tis true, I never view'd 'em within, and
therefore will not de&s;ire you to believe that they
de&s;erve the la&s;t part of that Character; for it de|pends
entirely upon the Te&s;timony of the <HI>Franks,</HI>
who are guilty of an unaccountable Prejudice, in
magnifying the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Magnificence. This is cer|tainly
a very great and inexcu&s;able Weakne&s;s; and
I know not whether it is more unrea&s;onable to ad|mire
all things or nothing. We ought indeed to do
Ju&s;tice to every thing that is either Good or Beauti|ful:
but I know no Rea&s;on that obliges us to extoll
the mo&s;t ordinary Beauty, or rather Deformity it
&s;elf, e&s;pecially in a Place that may ju&s;tly boa&s;t of
&s;o many incomparable Wonders, among which I
may venture to reckon the ancient and va&s;t Ca&s;tle
of <HI>Cairo.</HI> 'Tis true, it may be &s;aid to be a mere
Heap of inhabited Ruines: but the&s;e Ruines are ex|tremely
Magnificent, and &s;uitable to the Glory and
Power of <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> who is reputed to be the Foun|der
both of this Structure, and of the great open
Pyramid. It &s;tands directly in the Middle of the
City, between the <HI>Old</HI> aud <HI>New</HI> Town, on &s;o large
and &s;teep a Rock, that one wou'd think it was pur|po&s;ely
fram'd by Nature to &s;ecure and command
<HI>Grand Cairo.</HI> 'Tis above two Miles in Compa&s;s, and
<PB N="220" REF="130">
was formerly &s;urrounded with thick Walls, like
tho&s;e of <HI>Alexandria;</HI> flank'd at the end of every
hundred Paces with great and very &s;trong Towers.
It has four Gates which lead into a fine open Place,
and from thence to &s;everal Streets; &s;o that it &s;eems
rather to be a Town than a Ca&s;tle. The <HI>Turks</HI> have
profan'd the&s;e venerable Monuments, by disfigu|ring
'em with their Cottages, which look like &s;o
many Rats-Ne&s;ts. Some Parts of <HI>Pharaoh's Palace</HI>
remain &s;till to be &s;een: The Room call'd <HI>Jo&s;eph's
Hall,</HI> is enrich'd with Gold and Azure, and adorn'd
with thirty fine Columns of Porphyry. That of
his Steward or Intendant, is not &s;o entire, and is
only remarkable for twelve Columns of <HI>Thebaic</HI>
Marble, which are not much inferiour to the for|mer
in Beauty. But the entire&s;t and mo&s;t admirable
Work in this Place, is the celebrated <HI>Well</HI> of <HI>Jo&s;eph.</HI>
'Tis cut or hollow'd in the hard Rock, a hundred
and &s;ix Foot deep, of a &s;quare Figure, each Side
containing eleven Feet, without reckn'ning the Stair-Ca&s;e,
which is &s;even Foot broad, and cut out of the
&s;ame Rock. It turns round the Well, and con&s;i&s;ts
of twelve &s;everal Windings, &s;ix of which contain
eighteen Steps a-piece, and the other &s;ix, nineteen;
&s;o that the total Number of the Steps amounts to
to Two hundred twenty two. The Stairs are &s;o
ea&s;ie and commodious, that they make two Oxen
go down every day to the Bottom of the Well,
which is dry, and from thence to a little &s;quare
Room, where there is a Spring, out of which
they draw Water continually, by a certain Con|trivance
of Wheels hung round with Buckets, that
di&s;charge the Water into a Ba&s;on or Ci&s;tern in the
mid&s;t of the dry Pit or Well; from whence 'tis
rais'd up in Buckets fa&s;ten'd to Ropes, that are let
down and drawn up again by the turning of other
Wheels. Round the Stair-Ca&s;e on the In&s;ide there
are Walls that &s;erve in&s;tead of Rails, and &s;ecure
<PB N="221" REF="130">
tho&s;e that go down from falling. At the Bottom
of the Well there is a Door on the Right-hand, and
another on the Left, both cut out of the Rock: and
'tis commonly believ'd that one of 'em leads to the
Red-Sea, and the other to the Pyramids. The fir&s;t
is impo&s;&s;ible, for the Sea is above thirty Leagues di|&s;tant:
but the &s;econd is not at all improbable, con|&s;idering
the great Works that were undertaken and
perform'd by the ancient <HI>Egyptians,</HI> and the Care
they took to dig &s;ubterraneous Pa&s;&s;ages to &s;ecure
their Retreat in ca&s;e of Nece&s;&s;ity. 'Tis true, the
Greatne&s;s of the Di&s;tance, and Hardne&s;s of the
Rock cou'd not but make this Attempt very diffi|cult;
but after all 'tis not near &s;o va&s;t a Work as
the Pyramids, and there mu&s;t be &s;ome Pa&s;&s;age that
begins at this Place: for tho' the Doors are at pre|&s;ent
wall'd up, 'tis plain they were de&s;ign'd for &s;ome
U&s;e. You will not be &s;urpriz'd at the Magnificence
of this Well, nor wonder what made the <HI>Egyptians</HI>
be&s;tow &s;o much Time, Pains and Co&s;t on the dig|ging
of it, if you con&s;ider how precious and valu|able
Water is in this Country. For (as I told
you in my la&s;t) there are but two Springs in all
<HI>Egypt,</HI> This, and That of <HI>Maltharea,</HI> of which I
&s;hall give you &s;ome Account before I fini&s;h my Let|ter.
And it &s;eems the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Monarchs were
afraid that the&s;e two Fountains &s;hou'd at la&s;t be
dry'd up; for they took care to bring Water from
the <HI>Nile</HI> in a very fine Aqueduct, beginning betwixt
<HI>Old Cairo</HI> and <HI>Boulac,</HI> and reaching as far as the
Ca&s;tle. Not far from <HI>Jo&s;eph's Palace</HI> there is a
dreadful <HI>Pri&s;on,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal Dungeons cut
out of the Rock. It bears the Name of the &s;ame
Patriarch, becau&s;e 'twas here, according to the
common Opinion, where he interpreted the Dreams
of the <HI>Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ler</HI> and <HI>Baker:</HI> if this Tradition be true,
it mu&s;t be acknowledg'd, that he was in a lamen|table
Condition, for this is certainly a very di&s;mal
Place.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="131">
<HI>Maltharea</HI> is a Place about a large League di&s;tant
from the City, whither the <HI>Franks</HI> often walk to en|joy
the plea&s;ant Shade of its fine Orange-Trees, and
refre&s;h them&s;elves with its delicious Water. There is
al&s;o a little Chapel in the &s;ame place, which, 'tis &s;aid,
the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin</HI> cho&s;e for her Abode, when &s;he fled
to <HI>Egypt</HI> with her Son <HI>Je&s;us;</HI> but the Circum&s;tances
of the Story are &s;o improbable, that it &s;eems to be
of the &s;ame Stamp with other fabulous Legends.
For they pretend that while &s;he liv'd in that little
Hou&s;e, perceiving at a great di&s;tance the Men whom
<HI>Herod</HI> had &s;ent after her, and, not knowing where
to flee, an old Sycamore bur&s;t open to receive
her and the little <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> and clo&s;ing again &s;ecur'd
'em from the Rage of their Enemies. A&s;&s;oon as
the Danger was over the miraculous Tree let 'em
forth, and remain'd open ever afterwards; but 'tis
extremely decay'd at pre&s;ent, and part of it is fall'n
away. However I &s;pent two Hours near it with a
great deal of Plea&s;ure; for the Sun &s;hone very
bright that Day, and the Verdure of the Myrtle,
Orange, and Limon-Trees was extremely agree|able.</P>
<P>There is another little Chapel in <HI>Old Cairo,</HI> where
the Virgin re&s;ided for &s;ome time: and near that
there are large Store-hou&s;es for Corn, which are
thought to be the &s;ame that <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> built when he
laid up Provi&s;ions again&s;t the &s;even Years of Fa|mine.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, I have entertain'd you with an Ac|count
of &s;ome of the <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Rarities. 'Tis true,
there are many other remarkable Monuments in
this Country, that are worthy of a Traveller's Cu|rio&s;ity;
but the very Sight of tho&s;e howling De|&s;arts
deterr me from undertaking a Journey that
wou'd expo&s;e me to &s;o many Dangers and Incon|veniencies.
Be&s;ides 'twou'd require a great deal of
Money, and I begin already to perceive that I mu&s;t
<PB N="223" REF="131">
take more than ordinary care to Husband my Stock.
I find al&s;o that the &s;ame con&s;ideration will not &s;uf|fer
me to pro&s;ecute my de&s;ign of vi&s;iting the <HI>Holy
Land,</HI> tho' 'tis not without an extream reluctancy
that I'm forc'd to deprive my &s;elf of the fight of a
place which the Saviour of the World hallow'd with
his pre&s;ence. But the Journey is prodigiou&s;ly
chargeable, and I'm re&s;olv'd to deny my &s;elf that
&s;atisfaction rather than to put my &s;elf in a conditi|on
that might oblige me to return to <HI>France.</HI> I in|tend
then to Embark on a <HI>Greek Saique,</HI> which in
few days will &s;et Sail for <HI>Smyrna,</HI> where, I hope, I

<HEAD>LETTER XVIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFter a very trouble&s;ome Voyage that la&s;ted a
whole Month, I arriv'd at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> a City of
<HI>Natolia,</HI> a hundred Miles from <HI>Scio,</HI> where you
may remember I &s;tay'd &s;o long that I found Matter
enough for a whole Letter.</P>
<P><HI>Smyrna</HI> was formerly &s;eated on two Mountains,
&s;eparated by a plea&s;ant Valley that divided the City
into two Parts, one of which was not above a
quarter of a League di&s;tant from the Sea. This
Mountain is &s;o high that you cou'd not go up or
rather climb the &s;teep a&s;cent in le&s;s than a full quar|ter
of an hour: And on the top of it was a large
<PB N="224" REF="132">
Ca&s;tle fortifi'd both by Nature and Art; for be&s;ides
the advantages of its Situation, 'twas &s;urrounded
with high and thick Walls, on which there was a
Parapet embattel'd after the Oriental fa&s;hion; and
certainly 'tis not ea&s;ily conceivable how &s;o many
Stones cou'd be carry'd up &s;o high. The Gate of
the Ca&s;tle is defended by two round Towers join'd
to the Wall: And in the Stone-work of the Tower
that &s;tands on the right hand as you enter, there is
a Figure of a Woman's Head and Neck, a Foot
and a half high, which is &s;aid to repre&s;ent a cer|tain
Amazon call'd <HI>Smyrna,</HI> who having Conquer'd
the City, call'd it by her own Name, and built the
Ca&s;tle. The in&s;ide is a meer heap of Ruines, a|mong
which I ob&s;erv'd a very fair Ci&s;tern twenty
Paces long and twelve broad, Vaulted and &s;up|ported
by &s;ix fine &s;quare Pillars which are all entire.
Be&s;ides, there is a little Chapel built like a Mo&s;quee,
but it &s;eems not to be very ancient. This Ca&s;tle
commanded the City on one &s;ide, and the Port on
the other; and from thence you have an unob|&s;tructed
Pro&s;pect of the Sea. 'Tis at pre&s;ent only
Inhabited by a <HI>Turk</HI> with his Wife and Daughter,
who is oblig'd to keep Watch, and give notice to
the Merchants when he di&s;covers a Ve&s;&s;el. De|&s;cending
from thence we &s;aw the Ruines of an
Amphitheater, about which there are Ditches
where the Lions were kept; and &s;omewhat higher
are the Niches where the Magi&s;trates &s;ate. 'Twas
here that S. <HI>Polycarp,</HI> the fir&s;t Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Smyrna</HI>
was crown'd with Martyrdom. He was one of
St. <HI>John</HI>'s Di&s;ciples, and yet even then the Schi&s;m
of the <HI>Greek</HI> Church was begun; for he was &s;ent to
the Pope to Negotiate an Accommodation, tho'
with very little Succe&s;s. The City was heretofore
very large, as it appears by the compa&s;s of its Walls;
for if any Man will give him&s;elf the trouble to
take an exact view of their Ruines, as I have done,
<PB N="225" REF="132">
he will be quickly convinc'd, that 'twas above
twelve Miles about: And the Error of tho&s;e who
contract its Dimen&s;ions, is only an effect of their
Carele&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>There is a very fine Aqueduct &s;till to be &s;een,
which brought Water to the part of the City next
the Sea. It reaches from one Hill to the other, and
contains 300 Paces in length. In the &s;ame part of
the Town there are very ancient Burying-places,
which at pre&s;ent belong to the <HI>Jews:</HI> And adjoin|ing
to the&s;e are the Burying-places of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
and <HI>Dutch,</HI> where there are very magnificent Marble
Tombs, enrich'd with fine <HI>Relievo's.</HI> This Place is
call'd St. <HI>Veneranda,</HI> from the Name of a <HI>Greek</HI>
Church, near which there is a Spring, fam'd for
curing Fevers miraculou&s;ly; tho' I'm confident its
Vertue con&s;i&s;ts only in quenching the Thir&s;t, which
it does very effectually, for 'tis extreamly cold and
clear, and may for that rea&s;on be reckon'd one of
the Rarities of <HI>Smyrna,</HI> where the Water is generally
bad.</P>
<P>This City was ruin'd in the time of <HI>Mark Anthony,</HI>
who caus'd it to be rebuilt at the foot of the Hill on
the Sea-&s;ide, where it &s;tands at pre&s;ent, &s;tretching
in length about two &s;hort Miles, and a little above
one Mile in breadth. This &s;ituation is more con|venient
for Trade than the former, and be&s;ides, the
Heat of the Summer is agreeably temper'd by a
cool Breeze that blows every day. But the&s;e Ad|vantages
are counter-balanc'd by the <HI>Earthquakes</HI>
that happen &s;o frequently in this place, and make
&s;uch a terrible havock that the Inhabitants often|times
wi&s;h that their Town were plac'd again on
the Hill, where they think the danger wou'd not be
&s;o great. For 'tis generally believ'd, that the Earth|quakes
are occa&s;ion'd by the va&s;t and deep Conca|vities
made by the &s;ubterraneous Streams that fall
from the Mountain, where the Wind and Vapours
<PB N="226" REF="133">
being pent up, and endeavouring to break forth
impetuou&s;ly, cau&s;e tho&s;e dreadful Jolts that are felt
here &s;o often. However I can a&s;&s;ure you, that the
Hill is much le&s;s &s;ubject to <HI>Earthquakes</HI> than the
place where the City &s;tands at pre&s;ent: For &s;ince I
came hither there happen'd four in one day, and
all of 'em &s;trong and violent enough to &s;trike a Ter|ror
into tho&s;e that are not accu&s;tom'd to 'em. Nor
does their frequency make 'em le&s;s dreadful to the
Inhabitants of this place; for as &s;oon as they per|ceive
the lea&s;t &s;haking of the Earth they run out of
their Hou&s;es with all the &s;igns of Fear and Amaze|ment,
and call upon God, every one according to
the Rites of his Religion. Nor can this be ju&s;tly
call'd a Panic Terror, for they were &s;o roughly
handl'd by an <HI>Earthquake</HI> three Years ago, that I
I wonder how any of 'em dur&s;t afterwards venture
to repair their ruin'd Habitations. About Noon,
when they were all at Dinner, the Earth began to
&s;hake &s;o furiou&s;ly as if the whole Machine of the
Univer&s;e had been falling to pieces. A thou&s;and
Hou&s;es were over-turn'd in an In&s;tant with a hide|ous
dinn, and 3000 Per&s;ons were buried under the
Ruines. The re&s;t who had the good Fortune to
e&s;cape, were &s;eiz'd with a terrible Con&s;ternation,
and ran wildly about, not knowing whither to flee,
nor where to hide them&s;elves; for they were &s;till
alarm'd with repeated Jolts. And be&s;ides, the lurk|ing
Fires that lay hid among the Ruines were fann'd
and blown up &s;o violently by a &s;trong Gale, which
accompany'd the <HI>Earthquake,</HI> that the Flame cou'd
not be extingui&s;h'd for the &s;pace of two days, till
the very Rubbi&s;h of the Hou&s;es was con&s;um'd.
Add to this di&s;mal Spectacle the howlings of tho&s;e
Wretches that were not quite kill'd by the fall of
the Hou&s;es, and you'll find your &s;elf oblig'd to ac|knowledge,
that never any accident produc'd a
more lamentable Scene of Mi&s;ery. At la&s;t the Sea|men
<PB N="227" REF="133">
that were on Board the Ve&s;&s;els in the Port,
came a-&s;hore, and found above 500 Per&s;ons alive
under the Ruines, &s;ome with broken Legs, and
others with broken Arms; &s;ome were bruis'd all
over, and all in general were Objects of Pity and
Compa&s;&s;ion. The Captains of the Ships carry'd
tho&s;e who were Hurt or Wounded on Board, with
the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Per&s;ons of their re&s;pective
Nations: But the re&s;t of the Inhabitants were
forc'd to lie abroad till they had prepar'd new
Lodgings, which were only &s;ome paltry Huts of
Straw. That part of the City where the <HI>Franks</HI>
live was mo&s;t violently &s;haken, &s;o that they were
all Sufferers, and mo&s;t of 'em lo&s;t in one day the
fruit of many Years Labour. Some that had &s;trip'd
them&s;elves to the very Shirt to enjoy with greater
Plea&s;ure the Coolne&s;s of the Wind, were reduc'd to
the nece&s;&s;ity of begging Coats to cover their Na|kedne&s;s.
As for the Societies of Merchants, tho'
they were con&s;iderable Sharers in the common Ca|lamity,
the greatne&s;s of their Stocks kept 'em from
falling into &s;uch an exce&s;s of Mi&s;ery. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
and <HI>Dutch</HI> particularly are &s;o rich, that they can
ea&s;ily &s;upport the lo&s;s of 50000 Livres: But every
Man &s;uffer'd proportionably to his E&s;tate, and it
may be &s;aid that the Poor lo&s;t more than the Rich,
becau&s;e they were depriv'd of their All.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>Fabre</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Con&s;ul peri&s;h'd under
the Ruines, notwith&s;tanding all the Endeavours
that were us'd to &s;ave him; and &s;everal Rich Mer|chants
had the &s;ame Fate. Next Year the <HI>Plague</HI>
broke forth among tho&s;e whom the <HI>Fire</HI> and the
<HI>Earthquake</HI> had &s;par'd; and the la&s;t Year may be
reckon'd as Calamitous as either of the former, by
rea&s;on of the horrible Di&s;orders that were commit|ted
here by the <HI>Algerines</HI> and <HI>Barbarians.</HI> Thus,
within the compa&s;s of <HI>Three Years,</HI> this City has
&s;uffer'd <HI>Four</HI> of the &s;evere&s;t <HI>Judgments</HI> that are u&s;ually
<PB N="228" REF="134">
inflicted by Heaven. The&s;e Misfortunes wou'd
have ruin'd a poor Town, but there are hardly
any Foot&s;teps of 'em left in this; for 'tis almo&s;t
quite Rebuilt already, and the Street where the
<HI>Franks</HI> live is fairer than 'twas before.</P>
<P>This is the mo&s;t con&s;iderable &s;eat of Commerce
in the <HI>Levant,</HI> and the Dignity of the <HI>Con&s;uls</HI> who
re&s;ide here is next to that of <HI>Amba&s;&s;adors.</HI> Their
Juri&s;diction is extended over <HI>Natolia, Scio, Metelin,</HI>
and &s;everal other I&s;lands of the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> in which
they appoint <HI>Vice-Con&s;uls,</HI> who govern under their
Authority. This is a very Honourable Employ|ment,
and tho&s;e who are po&s;&s;e&s;t of it are much re|&s;pected,
even by the <HI>Turks,</HI> who have as great a
Veneration for Con&s;uls as for Amba&s;&s;adors, and
receive 'em at Audiences with the &s;ame Ceremonies.
When they go thro' the Streets, the <HI>Turks</HI> draw up
in Files, and open a Pa&s;&s;age for 'em, as for a Ba&s;&s;a:
Nor do they ever walk abroad without two Inter|preters,
and as many <HI>Jani&s;aries,</HI> who march before
'em, and &s;erve in&s;tead of a Life-Guard; and be|&s;ides,
they are accompany'd with two or three
Merchants, and follow'd by their Servants in Li|very.
But on the days of Audience their Train is
more numerous and &s;plendid, for they are always
preceded by &s;ix Interpreters, and a like number
of <HI>Jani&s;aries,</HI> with <HI>Zercola's</HI> on their Heads; and
follow'd by all the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Per&s;ons of the
Nation, who&s;e number &s;ometimes amounts to above
forty. Nor does the Grandeur of this Po&s;t con&s;i&s;t
meerly in external Pomp; for their Power is as
con&s;iderable as their State, and their Authority
over their re&s;pective Nations exceeds that of ordi|nary
Governors, &s;o much the more as they are far|ther
di&s;tant from the Court. 'Tis true, that in the
management of Affairs that meerly regard Trade,
they are oblig'd to call a Meeting of the Principal
Merchants, who decide the Matter by plurality of
<PB N="229" REF="134">
Voices, and the Con&s;ul is only Pre&s;ident of the
A&s;&s;embly. But in all ca&s;es that relate to the admi|ni&s;tration
of Ju&s;tice or the Government of a City,
he repre&s;ents the Per&s;on of the Sovereign, and is as
exactly obey'd. He is the ab&s;olute Judge of all
Suits or Actions, whether Criminal or Civil; and
has under him a <HI>Chancellor,</HI> who performs the Office
of a Clerk and Notary, a <HI>Secretary,</HI> and a <HI>Trea&s;urer,</HI>
who receives all the Money that is &s;ent either on
the publick Account, or by way of private Com|mi&s;&s;ion.
The Dignity of his Function is al&s;o con|&s;picuous
in the Church, where he &s;its in an arm'd
Chair, with a Cu&s;hion of Crim&s;on Velvet to kneel
upon. But the main advantage of this Office is in
my Opinion the largene&s;s of its Revenue, which
&s;eldom or never amounts to le&s;s than 18000 <HI>French
Livres.</HI> All <HI>Franks</HI> are oblig'd at their Arrival to
addre&s;s them&s;elves to their re&s;pective Con&s;uls, and
de&s;ire their Protection, or otherwi&s;e mu&s;t expect to
be &s;eiz'd, and &s;ent back to their own Country.
Yet, without any regard to that Cu&s;tom, I have
put my &s;elf under the Protection of Mon&s;ieur <HI>de
Hochepied,</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> Con&s;ul: For when I went to
&s;ee him, and acquainted him with my de&s;ign, he
offer'd me that Favour with &s;o much Genero&s;ity,
that I neither cou'd, nor was willing, to refu&s;e it.
Nor did his Civility &s;top there, for he oblig'd me
to accept of a Lodging in his fine Hou&s;e, where I
need not be afraid of my Countrymen's Indignation.
However, to avoid any accident that might happen,
I &s;eldom or never go abroad but in his Company,
tho', con&s;idering the kindne&s;s he expre&s;&s;es to me on
all occa&s;ions, I believe I might walk alone without
any danger. For he is &s;o much honour'd, re&s;pected,
and belov'd by all the Nations who re&s;ide here,
and even by the <HI>French</HI> them&s;elves, that there is not
one Per&s;on, &s;mall or great, who wou'd not run to
<HI>Japan,</HI> rather than di&s;oblige him. He is u&s;ually
<PB N="230" REF="135">
call'd, <HI>The Con&s;ul,</HI> without any Addition, as if he
were the only Per&s;on in <HI>Smyrna</HI> who cou'd pretend
to that Character: The re&s;t of the <HI>Con&s;uls</HI> are
known by the Names of their re&s;pective <HI>Nations,</HI>
but he is <HI>The Con&s;ul</HI> by way of Eminency. And,
to give you a better Idea of him, I can a&s;&s;ure you
that &s;o univer&s;al a Love and E&s;teem is purely the
effect of his Merit; for he is Ma&s;ter of a va&s;t Wit,
his Temper is &s;weet, civil, and obliging, and in one
world he is a <HI>compleat Per&s;on,</HI> which I think is the
ju&s;te&s;t and mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive Account I can give you
of him. There are &s;o many Perfections requir'd
to make a Man worthy of that Character, that a
<HI>Compleat</HI> Man is certainly one of the greate&s;t Ra|rities
of this Age: But all the&s;e Qualifications are
united in him. He is de&s;cended of a Noble and
Ancient Family in <HI>Holland,</HI> which can boa&s;t of an
uninterrupted Succe&s;&s;ion for above 300 Years, and
is Ally'd to the Principal Hou&s;es in the <HI>Netherlands.</HI>
Among the re&s;t I &s;hall only mention its late Alliance
with the mo&s;t ancient Family of the <HI>Collier's,</HI> which
is originally of <HI>Scotland:</HI> Their<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Advance.</NOTE> Device
is the fine&s;t that ever I &s;aw, nor do
they bear it in vain. For they have upon all occa|&s;ions
&s;ignaliz'd their Courage in Military Atchieve|ments;
and there are at pre&s;ent three of that Fa|mily
in the King's Service, who &s;eem to make Va|lour
their Favourite Vertue, and are known and
e&s;teem'd by the whole Army, both for that and a
thou&s;and other no le&s;s glorious Endowments.</P>
<P><HI>Madam de Hochepied</HI> is the Si&s;ter of the pre&s;ent,
and Daughter of the late <HI>Dutch Amba&s;&s;ador.</HI> She's
a fini&s;h'd Beauty, and has the Air of a Prince&s;s;
and be&s;ides (which is as true as it &s;eems incredible)
&s;he is ab&s;olutely Mi&s;tre&s;s of <HI>Seven</HI> of the mo&s;t diffi|cult
and oppo&s;ite <HI>Languages</HI> in the World. For be|&s;ides
the <HI>Dutch,</HI> which is her natural Tongue, &s;he
&s;peaks the <HI>French, Italian, Greek, Ru&s;&s;ian, Turki&s;h,</HI> and
<PB N="231" REF="135">
<HI>Arabian</HI> Languages, and &s;peaks 'em all &s;o perfectly
well, that I have often heard her explaining to
Interpreters the true &s;en&s;e of certain hard Words,
of which they were ignorant before. In &s;hort,
&s;he's in all re&s;pects an admirable Per&s;on. Judge,
Sir, whether I can think the time tedious which
I &s;pend in &s;uch agreeable Company, and in a
Hou&s;e where I'm &s;o kindly entertain'd; and whe|ther
you can blame me for not ha&s;tening my de|parture.
I'm re&s;olv'd to expect an occa&s;ion for
<HI>Venice,</HI> and I believe 'twill be a long time before
I can find one; becau&s;e the <HI>Venetian</HI> Ve&s;&s;els never
venture to appear in this part of the Sea, till the
<HI>Turki&s;h Fleet</HI> be laid up, tho' they have no great
rea&s;on to dread it, &s;ince the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> for all
his <HI>Grandeur,</HI> is Ma&s;ter only of <HI>Eleven Ships of War.</HI>
'Tis true, if all his Galleys wou'd put to Sea,
their number might at lea&s;t amount to 200; but
as Affairs are manag'd at pre&s;ent, his Navy
makes no great Figure. You may expect a more
particular Account of the&s;e things in my next.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU might ju&s;tly accu&s;e me of Lazine&s;s, or
want of Complai&s;ance, if I &s;hou'd not employ
the lei&s;ure I enjoy at pre&s;ent in recollecting my
Ob&s;ervations concerning the Government, Religion,
Manners, and Cu&s;toms of the <HI>Turks.</HI> I &s;hall en|deavour
therefore to &s;atisfie your Curio&s;ity, by en|tertaining
you with a &s;hort account of the&s;e Sub|jects,
avoiding all impertinent Repetitions of tho&s;e
obvious and common Remarks that are to be met
with in almo&s;t every Book of <HI>Voyages.</HI> And I hope
the Points I propo&s;e to handle will furni&s;h me with
&s;ufficient Matter for <HI>Three Letters;</HI> the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of which
&s;hall treat of the <HI>Government,</HI> the <HI>&s;econd</HI> of the <HI>Reli|gion,</HI>
and the <HI>third</HI> of the <HI>Manners</HI> and <HI>Cu&s;toms</HI> of
the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Turki&s;h Empire,</HI> according to the primitive
and fundamental Con&s;titution of the Government,
is ab&s;olutely and entirely <HI>De&s;potic;</HI> that is, a Su|pream
and Arbitrary Power is lodg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d in the Per&s;on
of the <HI>Emperor,</HI> who&s;e <HI>Will</HI> is the only <HI>Law</HI> by
which he Rules, and who acknowledges no other
Maxim of Government than <HI>Sic volo, &s;ic jubeo.</HI> He
is not curb'd by any written Law or Cu&s;tom, and
tho&s;e whom he Oppre&s;&s;es have not &s;o much as a
right to Complain. He may take away any Man's
E&s;tate, and either keep it, or give it to another.
Sometimes he pa&s;&s;es by the mo&s;t ancient <HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI>'s,
and in one day advances a &s;imple <HI>Chiaux,</HI> or even
a <HI>Cook,</HI> to the Dignity of <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier.</HI> He &s;ends
for the Heads of tho&s;e whom he has a Mind to be
rid of, who are Murder'd without any Trial or
<PB N="233" REF="136">
Form of Ju&s;tice, and even without knowing the
Rea&s;on of his Di&s;plea&s;ure. In one Word, his Plea|&s;ure
is the &s;upreme and uncontroulable Law. This
unlimited Power of the <HI>Sultan</HI> is founded on the
<HI>Mahometan Religion,</HI> which enjoins a blind Obedi|ence
to all his Commands under Pain of Damna|tion.
But the <HI>Turks</HI> of late have render'd their Slavery
more tolerable; for tho' they have made no Alte|ration
in the Con&s;titution of the Government,
their Practices are very different from what they
were heretofore.</P>
<P>The <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier</HI> is the Chief Mini&s;ter of State,
and is call'd <HI>King</HI> by the <HI>Turks,</HI> to &s;hew how much
the <HI>Sultans</HI> &s;light and undervalue that Title, in Imi|tation
of the Old <HI>Roman Emperours,</HI> who be&s;tow'd
Kingdoms on their Favourites. This is the Rea|&s;on
why the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> &s;tiles him&s;elf <HI>The Pro|tector
of Per&s;ecuted Kings,</HI> and the <HI>Di&s;tributer of
Crowns;</HI> tho' he wears none him&s;elf, not even on
the Day of his Public Inauguration, for the only
Badge of his Imperial Dignity is a magnificent <HI>Sabre,</HI>
enrich'd with precious Stones, which the <HI>Mufti</HI> girds
to his Side. The <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier</HI> is entru&s;ted with the
whole Management of Affairs, and his Power is
almo&s;t equal to the <HI>Sultan</HI>'s. He is in a great mea|&s;ure
the Arbiter of Peace and War, and creates the
Fortune of all the Great Officers in the Empire.
'Tis true, he ought not to do any thing without the
Advice of a Council, compos'd of &s;even <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's,</HI>
call'd the <HI>Vi&s;iers of the Bench:</HI> but they have only a
Shadow of Authority, which &s;carce de&s;erves to be
mention'd.</P>
<P>The next in Order, are the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's,</HI> who are a
&s;ort of Vice-Roys in the Provinces. Their Office
is to admini&s;ter Ju&s;tice exactly, and to keep the Peo|ple
in Subjection to the Government. They are al|&s;o
oblig'd to pay a yearly Tribute to the <HI>Grand Sig|nior,</HI>
both of Money and Slaves, without reck'ning
<PB N="234" REF="137">
the <HI>Carache,</HI> Cu&s;toms, and other Impo&s;ts that are u&s;u|ally
exacted. This is the utmo&s;t Extent of the Legal
Authority of the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's;</HI> but they commonly abu&s;e
their Power, and are more arbitrary Tyrants than
the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> him&s;elf. Their principal Aim is
to rai&s;e their Fortune &s;peedily; and in order to that
they rob the Widow and Orphan, and fill the Land
with Spoil and Oppre&s;&s;ion, never &s;crupling to com|mit
a gainful Crime, tho' attended with the ba|&s;e&s;t
Circum&s;tances. The <HI>Sultan</HI> is forc'd to di&s;&s;em|ble
his Knowledge of the&s;e Di&s;orders, for want of
Power to &s;uppre&s;s 'em: for every <HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI> maintains
&s;ome &s;tanding Forces at his own Charge, who&s;e
A&s;&s;i&s;tance he may command upon all Occa&s;ions, if
their Payment be not wholly neglected. Whereas
the <HI>Sultan,</HI> who for the mo&s;t part wants Money to
pay his Army, and perhaps does not &s;hew him&s;elf
twice in his Life to the Soldiers, is &s;o far from be|ing
Ma&s;ter of 'em, that he is almo&s;t always con|&s;train'd
to &s;ubmit to their Authority. This is the
fatal Source of all tho&s;e Seditions that have &s;o often
&s;haken, and will at la&s;t overturn the Empire. For
how can we &s;uppo&s;e that Subjects will either love
or fear a lazy Prince, that takes no Share in the Bu|&s;ine&s;s
of State or War: a Prince, that contents him|&s;elf
with a Chimerical Show of Grandeur and Pow|er,
and &s;eems rather to be a <HI>Mock-King</HI> in a <HI>Farce</HI>
than a <HI>Ruler</HI> of <HI>Kingdoms?</HI> 'Tis plain both from Rea|&s;on
and Experience, that a great Monarch, who wou'd
be the <HI>ab&s;olute</HI> Ma&s;ter of his Subjects, ought to apply
him&s;elf to the Execution and Reformation of the
<HI>Laws,</HI> and above all, to gain the E&s;teem and Affection
of his <HI>Soldiers,</HI> whom he ought to look upon as the
&s;ure&s;t Prop and Support of his Authority. An <HI>Ar|my</HI>
in a State cannot remain indifferent; they mu&s;t
and will have a Ma&s;ter; and will either continue
faithful to the <HI>Crown,</HI> or e&s;pou&s;e the Intere&s;t of
&s;ome de&s;igning <HI>Subject:</HI> And therefore it ought to
<PB N="235" REF="137">
be the Prince's Care to di&s;cover their Inclinations, and
to act accordingly. <HI>Kings</HI> are as feeble <HI>Creatures</HI> as other
Men, and as unable to perform any Great Action by
their own Power: but when they are at the Head of
100000 Men, all devoted to their Intere&s;t, 'tis then
they become the Terrour of the World, and their
<HI>Power</HI> is almo&s;t as boundle&s;s as their <HI>Ambition.</HI> The
Fate of Monarchs depends on their Armies, and
without the&s;e neither <HI>Alexander, Cae&s;ar,</HI> nor <HI>Lewis</HI>
XIV. cou'd have gain'd one Inch of Ground. This
is &s;o evident and certain a Truth, that never
any Per&s;on had the Confidence to controvert it:
and I believe the <HI>Ottoman Emperours</HI> are of the &s;ame
Opinion, tho' all their Actions &s;eem to be grounded
on very different, and even oppo&s;ite Maxims. A
Prince that wou'd &s;ecure the Loyalty of his For|ces,
mu&s;t take care of 'em him&s;elf, vi&s;it 'em of|ten,
give out all Orders, preferr Men of known Me|rit,
keep both the Officers and Soldiers under an exact
Di&s;cipline, and pay 'em as punctually as he can. The
<HI>Grand Signior</HI> ob&s;erves not one of the&s;e Maxims,
and therefore he may blame him&s;elf for the Unru|line&s;s
of his Army. But the Government is guilty
of another Blunder, which, in my Opinion, is no
le&s;s fatal than the former; I mean the u&s;ual way of
appea&s;ing Seditions, which break forth oftner than
once a Year. For every Tumult that &s;hakes the
<HI>Sultan</HI>'s Throne, co&s;ts him the Heads of a hundred
of his Principal Officers: The <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier</HI> is com|monly
made the fir&s;t Sacrifice, and afterwards that
important Charge is entru&s;ted to &s;ome young and
unexperienc'd Per&s;on, as if a <HI>Mini&s;ter of State</HI> cou'd
&s;pring up in a Night like a <HI>Mu&s;hroom.</HI> This Cu&s;tom
is directly oppo&s;ite to common Sence, which teaches
us that no Man ought to be advanc'd to &s;o high a
Po&s;t, but one that has been long accu&s;tom'd to State-Bu&s;ine&s;s,
and has &s;pent his whole Life in fitting
him&s;elf for the Management of &s;o great a Tru&s;t.
<PB N="236" REF="138">
The&s;e Con&s;iderations give me an <HI>Idea</HI> of the <HI>Turki&s;h
Empire,</HI> which I cannot expre&s;s better than by com|paring
it to a <HI>Coach</HI> drawn by a Sett of <HI>ungovernable
Hor&s;es,</HI> each of which pulls a contrary Way.</P>
<P>If we de&s;cend lower, and take a more particular
View of the Government, we &s;hall every where
find the di&s;mal Effects of the&s;e Di&s;orders. The Di|&s;tempers
of the <HI>Head</HI> are u&s;ually communicated to
the <HI>Inferiour Members:</HI> And I never &s;aw a Country,
where Ju&s;tice is &s;o often and &s;o impudently pervert|ed,
by tho&s;e who are entru&s;ted with the Execution
of it. I know 'tis the Cu&s;tom of &s;ome Travellers
to magnifie the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> way of admini&s;tring Ju&s;tice:
but &s;uch a groundle&s;s Conceit is only the Effect of
the powerful Inclination mo&s;t Men have to admire
every thing that is unu&s;ual or extraordinary. And
I'm confident that a bare Account of their Method
of Judging <HI>Civil</HI> and <HI>Criminal</HI> Cau&s;es, will give you
a very different Notion of their boa&s;ted Ju&s;tice;
You, I &s;ay, who are not tainted with tho&s;e com|mon
Prejudices, but are always wont to judge of
things as they <HI>are in them&s;elves,</HI> without con&s;idering
whether they are <HI>rare</HI> or <HI>common.</HI></P>
<P>They have no <HI>written Laws</HI> but what are con|tain'd

thing that it forbids is e&s;teem'd unlawful and pu|ni&s;hable.
Neverthele&s;s the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's</HI> and <HI>Cadi's</HI> judge
as they plea&s;e, for the Book is very &s;hort, and be|&s;ides
a great deal fuller of Dreams and Ab&s;urdities
than of Laws or Moral Precepts; and tho&s;e few it
contains are &s;o ambiguou&s;ly expre&s;s'd, and deliver'd
in &s;o loo&s;e a Manner, that the&s;e greedy Officers
cannot de&s;ire a more favourable Opportunity to &s;a|tisfie
their Avarice. Be&s;ides they judge without Ap|peal,
and cau&s;e the Sentence to be executed upon
the Spot. 'Tis true, &s;ome highly injur'd Per&s;ons
have recour&s;e to the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s <HI>Divan;</HI> but
<PB N="237" REF="138">
then the Inju&s;tice mu&s;t be very plain and inexcu&s;a|ble,
or 'tis in vain to expect Satisfaction; and that
is &s;o &s;eldom obtain'd, that few prudent Men will
venture on &s;o trouble&s;ome and expen&s;ive a Journey:
for &s;ince 'tis not the Cu&s;tom to record either the
Pleadings, or the Sentence, the Judge may ea&s;ily
elude all the Arguments of his Accu&s;ers. 'Tis true,
the Number of the Plaintiffs is u&s;ually &s;o great, and
the Informations of other Officers &s;o po&s;itive, that
the Truth is at la&s;t di&s;cover'd, and the Offen|ders
are puni&s;h'd. But tho' few <HI>Cadi's</HI> leave the Of|fice
with Honour, there is not the lea&s;t Care taken
to repair the Lo&s;&s;es of tho&s;e whom they have ru|in'd.
For, be&s;ides what I intimated before, that
their Proceedings are not regi&s;ter'd, the new <HI>Cadi</HI>
is u&s;ually as great a Rogue as his Predece&s;&s;our; &s;o
that the poor oppre&s;s'd People mu&s;t bear their Mi&s;|fortunes
as patiently as they can, without the lea&s;t
hope of Redre&s;s.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cadi's</HI> are mere Beggars when they are fir&s;t
advanc'd to that gainfull Po&s;t, and their Commi&s;&s;ion
la&s;ts but a Year: yet in le&s;s than three Months
the&s;e tatter'd Scoundrels exchange their Rags for
gawdy Habits, and a magnificent Equipage, and at
the End of the Year are Ma&s;ters of va&s;t E&s;tates.
We exclaim again&s;t our <HI>Lawyers</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> and will
not &s;uffer tho&s;e who have &s;pend 20 or 30 Years in
a perpetual Hurry of Bu&s;ine&s;s, to enjoy the Fruit of
their Labours in Peace, tho' the Fortunes they ac|quire
are for the mo&s;t part &s;o &s;mall, that they can
hardly &s;ub&s;i&s;t without Employment. But I'm con|fident
a little Acquaintance with the Cu&s;toms of
this Country wou'd quickly &s;top the Mouths of our
Grumblers: for if the <HI>Cadi</HI> of a con&s;iderable City
were permitted to hold his Office <HI>Ten</HI> Years, he
wou'd be richer than a <HI>Pre&s;ident au Mortier.</HI> He

Crowns; and you may ea&s;ily judge how mi&s;e|rably
<PB N="238" REF="139">
the Inhabitants were oppre&s;s'd by a Judge that
cou'd in one Year heap up &s;o great a Trea&s;ure. 'Tis
true he dur&s;t not expect the Coming of his Succe&s;|&s;our,
but march'd off eight days before, without
&s;taying to take leave of his Friends, according to
the prudent Cu&s;tom of his Brother-Rogues. For they
are oblig'd to give an Account of their Admini&s;tra|tion
to the &s;ucceeding <HI>Cadi's,</HI> who make a Report
to the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s <HI>Divan,</HI> and even &s;ecure their
Per&s;ons when the Comlaints again&s;t 'em are very
numerous and grievous. But they are too con&s;cious
of their Guilt, to &s;tand a Trial which they know
wou'd infallibly ruine 'em; and therefore to avoid
&s;o terrible a Danger, they go immediately to their
Patron at the <HI>Port,</HI> who receives his Share in the
Booty, and grants 'em his Protection, without which
they wou'd be puni&s;h'd without Mercy. Yet &s;ome
of 'em chu&s;e rather to buy their Peace of the new
<HI>Cadi,</HI> who, for 8 or 10 <HI>Pur&s;es,</HI> which amounts to 12

as they can de&s;ire.</P>
<P>All <HI>Civil</HI> Affairs are judg'd by the <HI>Cadi</HI> according
to the Depo&s;ition of <HI>Witne&s;&s;es,</HI> without any regard
to <HI>Writings.</HI> For &s;uppo&s;e you had lent 1000 <HI>Pia&s;ters</HI>
to a Man upon his Note or Bond, if he can but
&s;uborn two Men to affirm that they &s;aw him pay
you &s;uch a Summ, you mu&s;t infallibly lo&s;e your
Money. This Cu&s;tom gives a fair Opportunity to
Men of di&s;hone&s;t Principles to abu&s;e their Creditors;
&s;ince they may ea&s;ily find Witne&s;&s;es to prove any
thing, and even without giving them&s;elves the trou|ble
to enquire after 'em. One word, or a Sign to
the <HI>Cadi</HI> is &s;ufficient, who always keeps a Score of
Knights of the Po&s;t ready to &s;erve him or any of
his Friends on &s;uch Occa&s;ions. After the two con|tending
Parties have pleaded their own Cau&s;e as
well as they can, for there are no Barri&s;ters in <HI>Tur|key,</HI>
one of 'em clutches his right Fi&s;t, and
<PB N="239" REF="139">
&s;tretches out one, two, or three of his Fingers, &s;ig|nifying,
that he intends to pre&s;ent the <HI>Cadi</HI> with a
like number of <HI>Pur&s;es:</HI> Then his Adver&s;ary makes
the &s;ame Sign, and offers more or le&s;s, as he thinks
fit. At Night the <HI>Cadi</HI> &s;ends for the highe&s;t Bidder,
and having receiv'd his Pre&s;ent, requites his Com|pliment
very civilly the next Day, with a favourable
Sentence; after which he that is ca&s;t mu&s;t either
pay the Debt immediately, or go to Pri&s;on. And
(which is &s;till more unju&s;t) if you are not able to
maintain him, and pay the Fees of tho&s;e who ar|re&s;ted
him, you mu&s;t re&s;ign the third Part of your
Debt; in Con&s;ideration of which the poor Wretch
is kept rotting in the Gaol, till an exact Enquiry
be made into his E&s;tate. And if it be found
that the Debt exceeds the Value of his Goods and
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, the Payment is chang'd to a Corporal
Puni&s;hment, and he receives as many <HI>Ba&s;tinadoes</HI>
on the Soals of his Feet as he owes <HI>Pia&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rs,</HI> unle&s;s

<P>The Judgment of <HI>Criminal</HI> Affairs belongs to the
<HI>Ba&s;&s;a,</HI> who proceeds after the &s;ame manner: for
<HI>Money</HI> clears the mo&s;t barbarous Malefactor, and
without that, Ju&s;tice degenerates to Cruelty. The
<HI>Stake</HI> and the <HI>Gibbet</HI> &s;eem to be only made for <HI>poor

than when a Man is pro&s;ecuted for Murder or Rob|bery:

of 40000 <HI>A&s;pers,</HI> the u&s;ual Price of Blood, which
they exact of tho&s;e before who&s;e Doors the Murder
was committed; they &s;eldom or never take care to
execute Ju&s;tice on the Murderer. I have &s;een a <HI>Ja|ni&s;ary,</HI>
who had kill'd above 30 Men, walk thro'
the Streets unmole&s;ted, and with as much Confi|dence
as the mo&s;t innocent Per&s;on in Town. Nor

Robbers that infe&s;t the Country, and commit &s;uch
frequent Di&s;orders, that no wi&s;e Man will venture

this City, and put to Death about 20 Criminals: but
after all, the&s;e <HI>Great Inqui&s;itors</HI> are only terrible to tho&s;e
who are unable to buy their Favour, and even he
whom I mention'd had above fifty Cu&s;tomers of
this Sort. Among the re&s;t I &s;hall only take notice
of one In&s;tance of his mercenary Clemency; and
I hope I &s;hall ea&s;ily obtain your Pardon for a Di|gre&s;&s;ion

<P>A Man that us'd to work in a <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant's
Garden, was &s;eiz'd for a Murder, which he had
committed 7 or 8 Years before, and finding him|&s;elf
to be in a very hopele&s;s Condition, &s;ent to beg
the Merchant's A&s;&s;i&s;tance, who was too generous to
&s;uffer one that had &s;erv'd him to be hang'd for wan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
of 2 or 300 <HI>Pia&s;ters.</HI> The poor Man relying upon
his Ma&s;ter's promis'd Kindne&s;s, began immediately
to treat with the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI> for his Ran&s;om, which at la&s;t
was fix'd at 100 <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Pieces of Gold, commonly
call'd <HI>Scherifi,</HI> worth 2 1/4 <HI>Pia&s;ters</HI> each. The Bargain
being thus concluded, the Merchant gave the hun|dred
<HI>Scherifi</HI> to the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's Kiaia,</HI> who deliver'd but
<HI>ninety</HI> to the Trea&s;urer, having kept the other <HI>ten</HI>
for him&s;elf. Now you mu&s;t know that there are in
<HI>Turkey</HI> a &s;ort of Men who pretend to be <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s
<HI>Kin&s;men,</HI> and are highly reverenc'd by all Per&s;ons:
They wear green <HI>Turbants,</HI> and are call'd <HI>Scherifi,</HI>
which (you may remember I told you) is the
Name of the <HI>Pieces of Gold.</HI> When the Trial came
<PB N="241" REF="140">
on, after the Witne&s;&s;es were examin'd, the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI>
perceiving that there were <HI>Ten</HI> Pieces wanting of the
promis'd Summ, and imagining that Defect to be
a de&s;ign'd Breach of the Agreement, &s;eem'd to be
very nice and inexorable, and prote&s;ted that he
cou'd not acquit a Man who was po&s;itively charg'd
with Murder by &s;o many Witne&s;&s;es. But the <HI>Secre|tary,</HI>
who by good Fortune was acquainted with the
whole Tran&s;action, told him, That <HI>tho' the&s;e Wit|ne&s;&s;es
declar'd him Guilty, there were</HI> 100 Scherifi <HI>ar|riv'd,
who a&s;&s;erted his Innocencey, and that their Te&s;ti|mony
was much more convincing. I thought,</HI> &s;aid the
<HI>Ba&s;&s;a, I &s;aw but 90; 'Tis true,</HI> reply'd the <HI>Secretary,
but there were</HI> Ten <HI>more, who by rea&s;on of their great Age,
could not come up to your Pre&s;ence, and therefore &s;taid
below with the</HI> Kiaia. The <HI>Ba&s;&s;a,</HI> who was neither
Deaf nor Dull, under&s;tood the Meaning of tho&s;e
Expre&s;&s;ions, and declar'd the accus'd Per&s;on in|nocent.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal &s;orts of <HI>Puni&s;hments</HI> inflicted on
Malefactors in this Country; &s;uch as <HI>Beheading,
Drowning, Hanging, Strangling, Burning, Impaling,</HI>
and the <HI>Strappado.</HI> The two <HI>la&s;t</HI> are the mo&s;t Cru|el,
and are appointed only for <HI>Turks</HI> that renounce
the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Faith, or <HI>Renegado's</HI> that return to the
Profe&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Religion, or for tho&s;e
who are convicted of &s;ome very enormous Crimes.
<HI>Robbers</HI> and <HI>Murderers</HI> are <HI>hang'd, Women</HI> are <HI>drown'd,</HI>
tho&s;e who are found <HI>guilty</HI> of <HI>Rebellion</HI> or <HI>Sedition</HI>
are <HI>beheaded,</HI> and <HI>Burning</HI> is the Puni&s;hment of <HI>Chri|&s;tians</HI>
for <HI>bla&s;pheming</HI> again&s;t <HI>Mahomet</HI> or the <HI>Alcoran,</HI>
or for <HI>lying</HI> with a <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Woman. Not long ago
an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchant at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> very narrowly
e&s;cap'd Suffering for the la&s;t of the&s;e Crimes. He
kept a fair <HI>Turk</HI> with all imaginable Secrecy, and
never &s;aw her at his own Hou&s;e. To prevent Su&s;pici|on,
he procur'd a very pretty Yacht, in which he
went with her almo&s;t every day, to take the Air
<PB N="242" REF="141">
on the Sea of <HI>Marmora,</HI> or in the Canal of the
<HI>Black Sea,</HI> and u&s;ually &s;taid abroad till Night. But
at la&s;t the whole Intrigue was di&s;cover'd by the In|di&s;cretion
of a Servant; and they were both ap|prehended
by an Order from the <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier,</HI> who
at fir&s;t threaten'd to burn the Merchant, but was af|terwards
prevail'd with to accept a Fine of 10000
<HI>Pia&s;ters,</HI> which he paid upon the Spot. Several
Travellers have particularly de&s;crib'd the Puni&s;h|ments
call'd <HI>Impaling,</HI> and the <HI>Strappado,</HI> as well as
the Manner of giving the <HI>Ba&s;tonnado;</HI> and therefore
I &s;hall forbear troubling you with an Account of
what I &s;uppo&s;e you know already.</P>
<P>The Government of the Cities is manag'd by Five
Kinds of <HI>Officers,</HI> the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a, Sub-Ba&s;&s;a, Vaivode, Cadi,</HI>
and <HI>Receiver of the Cu&s;toms.</HI> The <HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI> is properly the
Governor, and judges criminal Cau&s;es; and the <HI>Sub-Ba&s;&s;a</HI>
is as it were his Deputy. The <HI>Vaivode</HI> takes care
of regulating Affairs in the City; he walks the Round
twice a-week, to examine the Weights and Mea|&s;ures,
to ob&s;erve whether unlicens'd Tipling-Hou&s;es
are kept, to puni&s;h Drunken Per&s;ons, and all tho&s;e
in the general who commit any Di&s;orders in the
City. Tho&s;e who are found guilty of the&s;e or any
other Abu&s;es, mu&s;t immediately &s;ubmit to the <HI>Ba|&s;tonnado,</HI>
e&s;pecially <HI>Drunkards,</HI> who are always very
roughly handl'd. The Function of the <HI>Sub-Ba&s;&s;a</HI> is
not much different. The <HI>Cadi</HI> is the Judge of all Civil
Suits; and the <HI>Receiver of the Cu&s;toms,</HI> who in <HI>France</HI>
is only a private Per&s;on without any Authority, is
in this Country empower'd to take Cognizance of
all fraudulent Practices relating to Pecuniary Duties,
in all which Ca&s;es he is both <HI>Judge</HI> and <HI>Party.</HI></P>
<P>The Jealou&s;ie that reigns among the&s;e Officers is
&s;o furious and extravagant, that they make it their
principal Bu&s;ine&s;s to di&s;credit and ruine one ano|ther.
'Tis a Plea&s;ure to hear the Characters which
they mutually give of each other; and a&s;&s;oon as
<PB N="243" REF="141">
they are acquainted with a Man, they begin to en|tertain
him with a Harangue on that Subject. The
<HI>Vaivode</HI> of this Place, with whom I have contracted
a &s;ort of Friend&s;hip, has told me a thou&s;and Sto|ries
of the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's</HI> and <HI>Cadi's,</HI> which, as diverting as
they are, I &s;hall rather chu&s;e to relate, than to write
to you: and therefore you mu&s;t even content your
&s;elf at pre&s;ent with one, for a Ta&s;te of the plea&s;ant
Entertainment you may expect at our next Meeting.</P>
<P>One who had as little Money as Hone&s;ty, that is,
none at all, was &s;ent in the Quality of a <HI>Cadi,</HI> to a
certain Town, where he hop'd the Wranglings of
the Inhabitants wou'd quickly &s;upply all his Wants.
But, as ill Luck wou'd have it, his Predece&s;&s;ors had
quite &s;poil'd his Market; and <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ion,</HI> which
makes &s;ome <HI>wi&s;e</HI> Men <HI>mad,</HI> had made the&s;e <HI>Fools,
wi&s;e.</HI> They heard he was a very hungry Devil,
and they re&s;olv'd to &s;tarve him out-right; wi&s;ely
con&s;idering that 'twas both their Duty and Intere&s;t
to live in Peace, or at lea&s;t to refer all their Diffe|rences
to the Arbitration of hone&s;t Friends, rather
than by tearing out their own Bowels to feed
their Greedy Devourer. And it &s;eems they &s;how'd
as much Firmne&s;s in pur&s;uing, as Wi&s;dom in ma|king
&s;o advantageous a Re&s;olution: for the <HI>Cadi</HI>
&s;pent &s;ix Weeks or two Months after his Arrival,
without any Employment but Fretting, Cur&s;ing, and
biting his Thumbs out of meer Spite, becau&s;e he
could find nothing el&s;e to exerci&s;e his Teeth upon.
One day as he was walking in the Streets, medita|ting
no doubt on his wretched Fate, he perceiv'd a
Baker, who was drawing a good Fat Goo&s;e out
of his Oven; and the &s;avoury Vapours a&s;&s;aulting
his No&s;e, rais'd a furious Commotion in his empty
Stomach: his Mouth water'd at the delicious Ob|j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ct,
and his Guts began to rumble with a more than
ordinary Violence. In a Word, he was &s;o little
Ma&s;ter of him&s;elf, that he cou'd not forbear beg|ging
<PB N="244" REF="142">
a Piece; but the Baker told him that the Goo&s;e
belong'd to one of his Neighbours, who had &s;ent it
to him to be bak'd. <HI>Come,</HI> reply'd the <HI>Cadi, take
my Advice: We'll eat the Goo&s;e, and when the Man
comes to fetch it, tell him that as thou wert bringing
it out to &s;ee whether 'twas ready, a Flock of Gee&s;e hap|pen'd
to fly by the Door, and that his Goo&s;e perceiving
its old Companions, wou'd not be per&s;uaded to &s;tay be|hind
'em. If he will not be &s;atisfy'd with &s;o fair an
An&s;wer, let him e'en take his Cour&s;e; for he mu&s;t
bring thee before me, and I'll find a Way to &s;ave
thee harmle&s;s.</HI> There was no need of more Argu|ments,
for the Baker's Stomach was on the <HI>Cadi</HI>'s
Side, and his Con&s;cience made no long Re&s;i&s;tance:
and therefore a&s;&s;oon as he had &s;ignify'd his Con|&s;ent,
the <HI>Cadi</HI> began to be&s;tir his Chaps &s;o vigorou&s;|ly,
that by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Friend the Bu&s;ine&s;s
was di&s;patch<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">d in an In&s;tant. Two Hours after the
Man came for his Goo&s;e, and the Baker repeated
his Le&s;&s;on very gravely: but the Je&s;t was &s;ome|what
too gro&s;s, and the Man was &s;o offended at
the Baker<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">s In&s;olency, that he took him immedi|ately
by the Neck, and told him that he mu&s;t ei|ther
re&s;tore his Goo&s;e, or go before the <HI>Cadi;</HI> for
there are no Sergeants or Bailiffs in this Country.
The&s;e Threatnings made no great Impre&s;&s;ion upon
the Baker, &s;ince he knew that he was to be judg'd
by his Fellow-Rogue; &s;o that he was as free from
Fear, as the other was full of Anger and Revenge
and walk'd very peaceably along with his Accu&s;er.
But they had not gone far when they were &s;topp'd
by the Lamentations of a poor Mule-Driver, who&s;e
Mule was fall'n under her Load, and lay &s;prawl|ing
on the Ground. The Baker was mov'd with
Compa&s;&s;ion at the poor Man's Misfortune, who
came to beg his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and took hold of the
Mule's Tail, while the Man him&s;elf endeavour'd t<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter">
rai&s;e her Head: but the Load was &s;o heavy, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="245" REF="142">
the Baker finding more Re&s;i&s;tance than he expected,
and pulling with all the Force of a Brawny Arm, at
la&s;t pluck'd the Tail off at the Root. The Owner of
the Mule was &s;o enrag'd at this unlucky Accident,
which made him incapable of following his u&s;ual Oc|cupation,
that not regarding the Baker's charitable
Intention, he &s;eiz'd him by the Collar, and help'd
the other Man to hale him along, for he was &s;o
far from going willingly as before, that con&s;idering
the <HI>Cadi</HI> was not at all concern'd in this Affair,
and not daring to rely too much on his Friend&s;hip,
le&s;t he &s;hould be oblig'd to pay the Price of
the Mule, he made a &s;hift to get loo&s;e; and think|ing
to make his L&s;cape, ran into a Hou&s;e not far
from the place where he met the Mule-Driver. But,
as Mi&s;chances never come &s;ingle, it happen'd that
there was a Woman &s;ix Months gone with Child,
&s;tanding in the Court of the Hou&s;e where he
thought to &s;ecure him&s;elf, who was &s;o terrify'd at
the &s;ight of a Man running, with two others pur|&s;uing
him furiou&s;ly at his Heels, that &s;he mi&s;car|ry'd
immediately. Thus the poor Baker had the
Mortification to &s;ee the Number of his Enemies en|creas'd;
for the Woman's Husband join'd with the
other Two, and all together carry'd him before the
<HI>Cadi,</HI> whom they acquainted with the Rea&s;on of
their Coming, expre&s;&s;ing their &s;everal Complaints
in a very mournful Tone, to move their Judge to
Compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I'm a very poor Man, <HI>&s;aid he who had receiv'd
the fir&s;t Injury,</HI> and all the Town knows that I had
but one Goo&s;e, which I intended to eat with my Wife
and Children, in Peace and Joy, as I hope for the

<P>Judge, Sir, with what Impatience and Fear the
Baker expected his Doom, and how the <HI>Cadi</HI> was
puzzl'd to bring him off in Spite of &s;o many cla|morous

&s;erv'd only to &s;how the Dexterity of the Judge, as

Plaintiffs.</P>
<P>I cannot, <HI>&s;aid he to the Fir&s;t,</HI> oblige a Man to re|&s;tore
a Goo&s;e, which, he affirms, flew out of his hands.
I confe&s;s the Story is very &s;urprizing and improbable,
but we mu&s;t always give credit to an hone&s;t Man's
Word: And therefore &s;ince thou can&s;t produce no Wit|ne&s;&s;es
to di&s;prove it, thou mu&s;t e'en re&s;olve to bear thy
Mifortune patiently.</P>
<P>As for thee, <HI>&s;aid he to the Second,</HI> 'tis another
Ca&s;e: He has pluck'd off thy Mule's Tail, and made
her unfit for Service. And therefore 'tis ju&s;t that be
&s;hou'd be oblig'd to keep her at his own Charge till
her Rump be heal'd.</P>
<P>But thou, poor Man, <HI>&s;aid he, turning to the Third&punc;</HI>

Labour to get a Child: and after all thy Toil, this

the Rogue to take her home with him, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ill her Belly
again, and to keep her till &s;he be in the &s;ame Conditi|on,
and the Child as old as when he made her mi&s;carry.</P>
<P>I will not ask your Opinion of this Story, till
you have heard both Parties: for the <HI>Cadi</HI> thinks
him&s;elf as hone&s;t a Man, and as worthy of your Audi|ence
as the <HI>Vaivode;</HI> and therefore you mu&s;t e'en be
&s;atisfy'd to hear his Tale next.</P>
<P>A very Rich Man dy'd, and left his Son Heir to
his whole E&s;tate, except 1000 <HI>Pia&s;ters,</HI> which he
bequeath'd to the <HI>Tyrant of the Country.</HI> Now you
mu&s;t know that the <HI>Turks</HI> are very religious Ob&s;er|vers
of the <HI>La&s;t-Wills</HI> of their Relations: and this
Young Man it &s;eems was very nice in that Point.
His Ignorance of his Father's Meaning made him
extremely unea&s;ie; for he concluded that if he
&s;hou'd detain another Man's Right, again&s;t his Fa|ther's
po&s;itive Command, 'twou'd certainly bring
the Cur&s;e of the <HI>Prophet</HI> upon him. After he had
&s;pent &s;ome time in con&s;idering where to be&s;tow the
Legacy, he re&s;olv'd to carry it to the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a,</HI> whom
he addre&s;s'd thus: <HI>Sir, My Father order'd me by his
La&s;t-Will, to give</HI> 1000 <HI>Pia&s;ters to the Tyrant of the
Country, without mentioning the Name of any particu|lar
Per&s;on. I was extremely troubl'd at the Ob&s;curity
of the&s;e Words, and not being able to unriddle the My|&s;tery,
I thought my &s;elf oblig'd to bring the Money to
you not as to a Tyrant, but as to the mo&s;t powerful
Per&s;on in the Country.</HI> The <HI>Ba&s;&s;a,</HI> who by chance was
an hone&s;t Man, reply'd very calmly, <HI>My Son, I neither
am, nor will be a Tyrant, carry the Money to the</HI>
Cadi, <HI>for he has more Right to it than I.</HI> The Young
Man perceiving that 'twou'd be in vain to urge him
to accept it, went according to his Advice, and
<PB N="248" REF="144">
made the &s;ame Complement to the <HI>Cadi,</HI> whom he
found to be as generous as the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a;</HI> for he told
him he cou'd not take it without injuring the Per|&s;on
for whom it was de&s;ign'd, and de&s;ir'd him to
carry it to the <HI>Receiver of the Cu&s;toms.</HI> But that Offi|cer
was as jealous of his Honour as either of the
re&s;t, and &s;ent the young Heir to the <HI>Vaivode,</HI> who
hearing that he had been with the other three, and
what An&s;wers he had receiv'd from 'em, told him that
as his Con&s;cience oblig'd him to ea&s;e a Neighbour of a
Burthen that &s;eem'd to be &s;o trouble&s;ome to him, &s;o it
wou'd not permit him to receive it ab&s;olutely <HI>gratis.
Let us,</HI> added he, <HI>make a feign'd Bargain; you &s;hall
buy all the Snow in my Court for</HI> 1000 Pia&s;ters, <HI>and
then I can take the Money with a &s;afe Con&s;cience.</HI> The
Young Man, who had been bandy'd about &s;o of|ten,
and was glad to be rid of the Money on any
Terms, con&s;ented immediately to the Propo&s;al. As
&s;oon as the Bargain was concluded, and the Deed
of Conveyance written, the <HI>Vaivode</HI>'s Secretary de|manded
his Fees; for in this Country the Purcha|&s;er
mu&s;t always pay for the Contract. The Young
Man was both vex'd and &s;urpriz'd at the Impudence
of the&s;e Blood-&s;uckers, and upbraided 'em with
their Inju&s;tice and Barbarity; adding, That he did
not expect to be troubl'd with their litigious Tricks
after he had freely pre&s;ented 'em with &s;o con&s;iderable
a Summ: But neither his Anger nor Arguments cou'd
prevail, for he was forc'd at la&s;t to give the Se|cretary
<HI>Ten Pia&s;ters</HI> more; after which he went
home with a Re&s;olution to return no more to a
place where he had been &s;o ill treated. But three
Days after the <HI>Vaivode</HI> &s;ent to acquaint him that
'twas time for him to remove his Commodity. The
Young Man imagining that they intended only to
put a Je&s;t upon him for his fooli&s;h Bargain, bid the
Me&s;&s;enger tell his Ma&s;ter, that he might keep both
<PB N="249" REF="144">
the Goods and the Money. But he was quickly
convinc'd, that he had be&s;tow'd the Legacy on the
Man who had the be&s;t right to it: For the <HI>Vaivode</HI>
forc'd him to remove all the Snow that was in his
Court.</P>

<P>IN pur&s;uance of the Method I propos'd in my
<HI>la&s;t,</HI> I &s;hall in <HI>this</HI> Letter give you a brief Ac|count
of the <HI>Turki&s;h Religion,</HI> which, in the Opini|on
of tho&s;e who profe&s;s it, is a <HI>New Law,</HI> In&s;ti|tuted
by GOD, in the room of the <HI>Chri&s;tian Re|ligion.</HI></P>
<P>GOD, they &s;ay, has &s;ent <HI>Four Prophets</HI> to reveal
his Will to Mankind, and in&s;truct us in the way to
Salvation. The fir&s;t was <HI>Enoch,</HI> who Preach'd and
Propheci'd, but did not commit his Doctrine to
Writing. For, in tho&s;e Days, GOD communica|ted
Him&s;elf to Mankind in &s;o &s;en&s;ible a manner,
that there was no need of a Written-Law. After
this Prophet had executed his Commi&s;&s;ion, he was
taken up into Heaven, both Soul and Body. In
<PB N="250" REF="145">
the mean time, GOD &s;eeing that Men perverted
their Ways, and made the want of a Written-Law,
a Cloak and Pretext for their Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, &s;ent
<HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> who brought the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> out of
<HI>Egypt,</HI> and gave 'em the Law which he had re|ceiv'd
from GOD. This was the &s;econd Prophet,
who&s;e Di&s;pen&s;ation was to continue till the coming
of <HI>JESUS CHRIST,</HI> whom they call the <HI>Breath
of God,</HI> acknowledging, that he was Conceiv'd by
Divine Operation, in the Womb of his Mother,
who remain'd a <HI>Virgin,</HI> even after his Birth. He
alter'd and reform'd the Law, according to the
Power with which God had entru&s;ted him, and for
that rea&s;on incurr'd the hatred of the <HI>Jews,</HI> who
&s;ought to put him to Death, and hir'd the Traytor
<HI>Judas</HI> to betray him. But when he came to the
<HI>Oliv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">-Garden,</HI> they were &s;eiz'd with &s;o &s;trange an
Illu&s;ion, that they Crucifi'd <HI>Judas</HI> in&s;tead of his
<HI>Ma&s;ter,</HI> who was, in the mean time, tran&s;lated to
Heaven, where he remains with the two former
<HI>Prophets.</HI> They &s;ay, this Opinion &s;erves much bet|ter
to di&s;play the Glory of <HI>CHRIST,</HI> than the
<HI>Chri&s;tian Doctrine;</HI> and brand us with Folly and Im|piety
for believing that He whom we adore as God,
was &s;hamefully Crucify'd. The very &s;ight of a
<HI>Crucifix</HI> fills 'em with Anger and Rage, pretending
that 'tis a horrid Injury to <HI>CHRIST,</HI> to repre&s;ent
him in a State of Ignominy and Suffering. They
believe al&s;o that He will come to judge the World
at the la&s;t Day; but that He will fir&s;t Reign upon
the Earth, and Marry, and beget Children. They
affirm, that He was a Holy Man, and a cho&s;en
Ve&s;&s;el; but they will not be per&s;waded to acknow|ledge
a <HI>Trinity</HI> of Per&s;ons in the Godhead, &s;aying,
That &s;uch an Opinion wou'd ab&s;olutely de&s;troy
the <HI>Unity</HI> of that Sovereign Being, without which
He cou'd not be GOD.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="145">
<HI>CHRIST</HI> was &s;ucceeded by <HI>Mahomet,</HI> after
whom there &s;hall come no other <HI>Prophet.</HI> 'Twou'd
be an endle&s;s Task to reckon up all the Glorious
Titles they be&s;tow upon him.</P>
<P>They differ not much from us in their Opinions
concerning the <HI>Divine Attributes.</HI> Only they have
&s;uch a peculiar Fondne&s;s for <HI>Prede&s;tination,</HI> that they
extend it even to the mo&s;t Indifferent Actions, yet
with &s;ome Limitations and Circum&s;tances which
'twou'd be very difficult to explain, and which they
them&s;elves do not well under&s;tand. Thus they are
firmly per&s;waded, that under the Reign of &s;uch an
<HI>Emperor,</HI> the State will infallibly and perpetually
have either a di&s;a&s;t'rous or happy Fate: And 'tis
this Per&s;ua&s;ion that makes 'em &s;o inclinable to de|throne
their <HI>Sultans.</HI></P>
<P>They believe, that there is an infinite number of
<HI>Angels,</HI> &s;ome <HI>Good</HI> and others <HI>Bad.</HI> The fir&s;t are
call'd <HI>White,</HI> and the others <HI>Black</HI> Angels or Devils.
They imagine that every Man has two Angels that
attend him continually, and that one of 'em writes
down all his Good, and the other all his Bad Acti|ons.
They addre&s;s their Prayers to the <HI>Black</HI> An|gels
as well as to the <HI>White,</HI> that they may &s;ecure
the Friend&s;hip both of the Inhabitants of <HI>Paradice</HI>
and <HI>Hell,</HI> tho', in their Opinion, the Souls of the
Damn'd enter not into the la&s;t of the&s;e Places till
the Day of Judgment. For 'tis an Article of the
<HI>Turki&s;h Faith,</HI> that the Spirits of the Wicked remain
in their Graves, where they are tormented by the
<HI>Black Angels</HI> till the la&s;t Day, when they &s;hall be
&s;ent to <HI>Hell,</HI> together with their Bodies, and &s;uffer
very cruel Puni&s;hments, for the &s;pace of One or
Two Thou&s;and Years, according to the Crimes
they committed in this Life; after which they
&s;hall be releas'd, and admitted into <HI>Paradice,</HI> where
they &s;hall enjoy the &s;ame Happine&s;s that is appoin|ted
for the Souls of Good Men. They think 'tis
<PB N="252" REF="146">
incon&s;i&s;tent with the Divine Goodne&s;s, and blame
us for believing that GOD will puni&s;h a Man
<HI>Eternally</HI> for the Offences of &s;o <HI>&s;hort</HI> a Life: Yet,
&s;ince they are extremely afraid of <HI>Hell,</HI> they pray
very devoutly to the <HI>Black Angels</HI> that they wou'd
be pleas'd not to write down all their Ill Acti|ons.</P>
<P>Since you will doubtle&s;s look upon their Opini|on,
of the Soul's re&s;ting in the Grave after Death,
to be very Ab&s;urd and Ridiculous, I &s;hall endea|vour
to give you a clearer Idea of their Thoughts
on that Subject.</P>
<P>They differ from us in the account they give of
the manner how the Soul <HI>Informs</HI> and Animates the
Body. For whereas we believe, that the&s;e two
Sub&s;tances are <HI>Hypo&s;tatically</HI> united, and that Death
con&s;i&s;ts in their Separation; they imagine that the
Soul and Body have no dependance on one ano|ther,
and that the ab&s;ence of the Spirit (which,
for Example, may take a Journey to Paradice) is
not nece&s;&s;arily attended with the De&s;truction of the
Corporeal Machine; tho' they acknowledge that
the Body is always depriv'd of Rea&s;on, during its
Separation from the Soul. Thus they believe, that
the only rea&s;on why a <HI>Fool</HI> or <HI>Ideot</HI> acts and &s;peaks
ab&s;urdly, is becau&s;e his Soul (and con&s;equently his
Rea&s;on) has for&s;aken him. As for <HI>Lunatic</HI> and
<HI>Hypochondriacal</HI> Per&s;ons, who have &s;ome lucid Inter|vals,
and are only depriv'd of their Rea&s;on by Fits,
they endeavour to &s;olve the Difficulty, by main|taining,
that the Soul leaves her Man&s;ion at certain
times, and returns again after a &s;hort Ab&s;ence:
And this, they &s;ay, is an effect of Providence,
either for the Puni&s;hment of the Di&s;temper'd Per|&s;on,
or for &s;ome other hidden De&s;ign. When a
Chri&s;tian tells 'em, that the&s;e Fits of Madne&s;s pro|ceed
from the Di&s;order and Indi&s;po&s;ition of the
Organs, which hinders the Soul from performing
<PB N="253" REF="146">
her Functions, they upbraid him with the ab&s;ur|dity
of his Opinion; for, &s;ay they, the Soul of
Man is a <HI>Spirit,</HI> and therefore cannot be &s;topt or
ob&s;tructed in the exerci&s;e of her Faculties by <HI>Mat|ter,</HI>
which is a Sub&s;tance of another, and ab&s;olute|ly
different Nature. From this Principle they infer,
that neither the Pre&s;ence nor Ab&s;ence of the Soul
can produce any alteration in the Machinal cour&s;e
of the Body, which is only mov'd by Springs:
And that when one of the principal Springs fails,
or is &s;poil'd, the Soul cannot prevent the Ruine of
the whole Engine. This, they pretend, is an ob|vious
Truth, and confirm'd by daily Experience:
And therefore we mu&s;t not be &s;urpriz'd, that a
dead Body neither Walks, Breathes, nor performs
any Operation, tho' the Soul be &s;till lodg'd in it:
For &s;ince &s;he is not the Author of the Machine
which &s;he Inhabits, 'tis beyond her Power either
to keep it entire, or to repair it after it falls to de|cay.
GOD alone, who made and contriv'd it,
can re&s;tore it, and renew its motion, as he will do
at the la&s;t Day. To confirm this Hypothe&s;is, they
cite, with a great deal of Confidence, what <HI>Pliny</HI>
relates of a Man who&s;e Soul and Body were wont
to be &s;eparated every day, &s;o that the Body re|main'd
without any appearance of Life or Motion,
till the return of the Soul, which afterwards us'd
to give an Account of all the wonderful things &s;he
had &s;een in the remote&s;t Countries. This, you
know, is one of that Author's fabulous Stories, and
yet the <HI>Turks</HI> pretend to draw from thence an evi|dent
and irrefutable Proof of their Opinion. Be|&s;ides,
they give the Soul a <HI>Figure</HI> exactly like that
of the Body, and upon this Principle maintain,
that the Souls of the Damned are beaten in the
Grave, and &s;uffer Torments, which a pure Spirit
&s;eems incapable of feeling. They believe al&s;o,
that the <HI>Bea&s;ts</HI> &s;hall not be depriv'd of the benefit of
<PB N="254" REF="147">
the Re&s;urrection, and that at the Day of Judg|ment
they will give an Account before <HI>CHRIST,</HI>
of all the Kindne&s;&s;es and Injuries they have re|ceiv'd
from Men. And this Conceit makes 'em
&s;o charitable to <HI>Irrational</HI> Creatures, that &s;ome of
'em buy little <HI>Birds</HI> and live <HI>Fi&s;hes,</HI> that they may
afterwards &s;et 'em at liberty.</P>
<P>They fan&s;ie them&s;elves <HI>polluted</HI> by &s;everal Things,
&s;uch as <HI>Sleeping,</HI> the touching of a <HI>Woman,</HI> and of
all &s;orts of <HI>Excrements;</HI> and therefore after any &s;uch
Accident, they perform their Ablution or <HI>Abde&s;t,</HI>
wa&s;hing their Face, Hands, Ears, and Feet, and
looking towards <HI>Mecca.</HI> In the Day they content
them&s;elves with wa&s;hing their Mouth, which they
repeat as often as they have occa&s;ion to obey the
nece&s;&s;ities of Nature: But after <HI>Copulation</HI> their
Ablutions are much more Ceremonious, for they
wa&s;h their whole Body in a Bath, as they do al&s;o
when a drop of <HI>Wine</HI> falls upon their Garments. I
have &s;een &s;ome of 'em &s;o extreamly Super&s;titious,
that they wou'd never afterwards wear a Ve&s;t that
was pulluted with <HI>Wine;</HI> tho' there are others of
le&s;s &s;crupulous Tempers who never refu&s;e to ta&s;te
that &s;pirituous Liquor, and even &s;ome that continue
Tipling till they have quite lo&s;t their Sen&s;es.</P>
<P>They <HI>Pray</HI> five times a Day, in the Morning at
the break of Day, at Noon, at Three a Clock in
the Afternoon, at Six in the Evening, and an hour
after the clo&s;e of the Evening. But they go only
twice to the <HI>Mo&s;quee,</HI> to the <HI>Sabah</HI> in the Morning,
and to the <HI>Quindy</HI> at Three in the Afternoon: And
even many of 'em perform their public Devotions
only on <HI>Friday,</HI> which is their Fe&s;tival-Day, as
<HI>Sunday</HI> is ours. On that day an <HI>Iman,</HI> or Prie&s;t of
the Law, &s;ays a Prayer, and delivers a kind of
Sermon or Exhortation to the Hearers: But the
Men are too jealous to &s;uffer any of the Fair Sex
to come to the Public Places of Wor&s;hip.</P>

'em. Since they believe <HI>Alms</HI> to be the &s;ure&s;t
Atonement for Sins, they neglect no occa&s;ion of
buying their future Peace. 'Tis this Principle that
excites 'em to leave con&s;iderable Legacies at their
Death, which, according to the Will of the De|ceas'd,
are employ'd in repairing public Fountains,
building Bridges, or paying the Portions of Indi|gent
Maidens. I have already told you, that their
Charity extends even to <HI>Bea&s;ts;</HI> and I &s;hall take this
occa&s;ion to add, that they are particularly kind to
<HI>Dogs,</HI> tho' naturally they do not love 'em, and
keep none in their Hou&s;es. Yet the Cities are full
of 'em, where they wander about the Streets, and
perpetuate their Kind like Wild Bea&s;ts. They are
&s;o mangy, lean, and mi&s;erable, that one wou'd
think they cou'd not live a day; and I have
&s;een &s;ome of 'em at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> &s;o near Starving,
that they wou'd jump into the Sea for &s;ome Bits of
Carrion which they perceiv'd at the bottom. How|ever,
&s;ince they cou'd not po&s;&s;ibly live on what
they find in the Streets, the richer &s;ort of <HI>Turks</HI>
buy Provi&s;ions for 'em, and feed 'em every Morn|ing
at their Doors with Eleemo&s;inary Bread and
Fle&s;h. They reckon it a heinous Crime to kill
a <HI>Dog, Cat, Hor&s;e,</HI> or any other Creature that
is not appointed for the Food and Nouri&s;hment
of Mankind: For they pretend that &s;ince Man is
not the Author of their Life, he ought not to de|prive
'em of it.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="148">
I &s;hall take this occa&s;ion to relate the Story of an
Accident that happen'd in this place, not above
eight days ago. There was a <HI>Dog</HI> that us'd always
to howl, when he heard the <HI>Muezin</HI> calling the
People to Prayers from the <HI>Minaret.</HI> The <HI>Turks,</HI>
who are Super&s;titious, even beyond Imagination,
cou'd not behold their mo&s;t Holy Rites profan'd
by an Impudent Cur, without an extream Indig|nation:
Yet they dur&s;t not kill him for fear of
offending GOD. However, they found out a
way to cha&s;ti&s;e the daring Criminal, without
provoking the Wrath of Heaven: For notwith|&s;tanding
all their Veneration for his Per&s;on, they
were loath to allow him greater Privileges than they
claim for them&s;elves. After mature deliberation
on &s;uch a weighty and important Ca&s;e, they ven|tur'd
at la&s;t to &s;eize him, and carry him before
the <HI>Cadi,</HI> where they Indicted him as a <HI>Dgiahour,</HI>
or <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> who derided the Law of the <HI>Prophet.</HI>
The Evidence was &s;o plain, that after a full Hear|ing
poor <HI>Towzer</HI> was condemn'd to be Cudgel'd to
Death, and the Sentence was immediately execu|ted.
Perhaps the oddne&s;s of this Relation may
make you &s;u&s;pect my Veracity &s;o far as to ima|gine,
that I Invented it on purpo&s;e to divert you:
But, in &s;hort, you mu&s;t either believe it, or in
plain Terms give me the Lye. 'Tis true, I dare
not warrant the truth of the Story I'm going to
tell you, but &s;ince it relates to the &s;ame Subject,
you mu&s;t e'en be content to read it.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the <HI>ordinary Dogs</HI> that wander about the
Streets, there are others call'd <HI>Jaccals,</HI> or <HI>Chacaly,</HI>
that run in the Fields, where they make a hideous
noi&s;e every Night. They do not Bark like other
Dogs, but have a kind of &s;harp or yelling Cry,
peculiar to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Now (if you'll believe the <HI>Turks</HI>) the <HI>Chacaly</HI>
or <HI>Wild-Dogs,</HI> in ancient Times, Inhabited the
<PB N="258" REF="149">
Cities, and the other <HI>Dogs</HI> liv'd in the Fields.
They were perpetual and irreconcilable Enemies
to each other, and fought many bloody Battles, in
one of which the <HI>Chacaly</HI> were Victorious, and the
Forces of the <HI>Dogs</HI> were &s;o &s;hatter'd that they
were oblig'd to beg a Peace, which was granted
by their Generous Enemies on the&s;e favourable
Terms; That the <HI>Dogs</HI> might &s;tay in the City till
their Wounds were heal'd, during which time the
<HI>Chacaly</HI> &s;hou'd retire to the Country; but that af|terwards
both Parties &s;hou'd return to their for|mer
Habitations. The&s;e Conditions were pun|ctually
perform'd by the <HI>Chacaly,</HI> but the <HI>Dogs</HI>
growing lu&s;ty and &s;trong, re&s;olv'd to maintain
their Po&s;t, and have ever &s;ince remain'd in the
City. 'Tis the remembrance of this Injury that
makes the <HI>Chacaly</HI> call to the <HI>Dogs</HI> every Night in
their yelling Language, and &s;ummon 'em to re&s;ign
a Place which they u&s;urp'd &s;o unju&s;tly; and they
an&s;wer as they Bark, crying &s;till, <HI>Yock, Yock,</HI> which,
in the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Language &s;ignifies <HI>No, no.</HI> But, in|&s;tead
of in&s;i&s;ting longer on the&s;e in&s;ipid Fables, I
&s;hall return to the <HI>Turki&s;h Religion,</HI> which is little
le&s;s ab&s;urd and ridiculous.</P>
<P>They are &s;o be&s;otted with their Conceits about
<HI>Prede&s;tination,</HI> that they u&s;e no manner of precau|tion
to pre&s;erve them&s;elves from Infectious Di|&s;tempers,
and are offended at the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> for taking
care of their Health on &s;uch occa&s;ions. A <HI>French|man</HI>
told me the other Day, that during the time
of a very violent Contagion, he perceiv'd at a
di&s;tance &s;ome <HI>Turks</HI> in the Street, who were car|rying
the Body of a Man that dy'd of the Plague
to his Grave. As he was turning another way on
purpo&s;e to avoid meeting 'em, one of the Com|pany
ran after him, and cla&s;p'd him in his Arms,
rubbing his Body upon him &s;everal times; after
which opening his Ve&s;t, and &s;howing him a large
<PB N="259" REF="149">
Plague-Sore under his right Pap, <HI>Learn,</HI> &s;aid he,
<HI>not to for&s;ake dead and dying Men.</HI> And indeed, if
we reflect &s;eriou&s;ly on the little care they take to
&s;top that raging Di&s;ea&s;e, we may rea&s;onably con|clude,
that none of 'em cou'd e&s;cape without a
kind of Miracle, if the Di&s;temper were as Con|tagious
as 'tis generally thought to be. For they
never avoid the Conver&s;e of tho&s;e who come from
an infected Place, and there are few Ports where
there are not &s;ome Ve&s;&s;els that left the Plague
reigning in the Towns from whence they came.
Yet this neglect of the Cautions us'd by other Na|tions
on &s;uch occa&s;ions, is never attended with
the lea&s;t ill-con&s;equence, unle&s;s when the di&s;po|&s;ition
of the Air has a &s;ort of natural tendency
to promote and &s;pread the Contagion, for then it
bur&s;ts forth impetuou&s;ly like Gun-Powder &s;et on
Fire. But this is not the Opinion of the <HI>Turks,</HI>
for they ab&s;olutely deny that the Infection depends
either on the Con&s;titution of the Air, or of hu|mane
Bodies, pretending that it proceeds wholly
from a &s;upernatural Cau&s;e, and that when GOD
de&s;igns to execute the fury of his Vengeance on
ob&s;tinate Sinners, he &s;ends an Army of <HI>black An|gels</HI>
to de&s;troy 'em. They add, that every Angel
receives of Bow and two &s;orts of Arrows, to inflict
either <HI>Death</HI> or <HI>Sickne&s;s,</HI> with orders to &s;hoot their
mortal Arrows at tho&s;e whom they find under the
Power of <HI>Sin,</HI> and to direct the others at &s;uch who
are only tainted with &s;ome <HI>Pollution.</HI> 'Tis then that
Men &s;tand mo&s;t in need of the Protection of their
<HI>White Angels,</HI> who intercede for 'em, and do what
they can toward the Blows that are aim'd again&s;t
'em, &s;ometimes covering a Man entirely, when
they perceive a great number of Enemies ready
to attack him. Yet notwith&s;tanding all their Care,
their A&s;&s;i&s;tance proves oftentimes ineffectual; and
therefore 'tis the Intere&s;t of every Man that re|gards
<PB N="260" REF="150">
his own Safety, to &s;ecure him&s;elf again&s;t the
Vengeance of tho&s;e de&s;troying Spirits, by leading
a &s;inle&s;s Life. The <HI>Turks</HI> pretend, that they infal|libly
perceive the Blow, when the Arrow pierces
'em: And even &s;ome <HI>Franks</HI> who have been two
or three times &s;eiz'd with the Plague, a&s;&s;ure me,
that they felt a certain <HI>Pricking</HI> in the place where
the Carbuncles break forth; which is not at all
improbable, &s;ince 'tis u&s;ual for &s;uch a trouble&s;ome
Sen&s;ation to accompany all &s;orts of Tumors. But
to conclude this Subject with my Letter, I &s;hall
only add, that the Plague which rages &s;o often in
the&s;e Oriental Countries, and &s;weeps away &s;uch
va&s;t numbers of the Inhabitants, is in &s;ome mea|&s;ure
nece&s;&s;ary for their Pre&s;ervation. For the num|ber
of the People is augmented Yearly by at lea&s;t
a fifth Part, and you will be the le&s;s inclin'd to look
upon this as a Paradox, if you con&s;ider that they
are allow'd to marry four Wives, and to keep &s;eve|ral
Concubines, and that there are 50000 Slaves
brought every Year into <HI>Turkey.</HI> So that the Coun|try
wou'd be quickly over-&s;tock'd with Inhabitants,
and in all probability, the People wou'd be in dan|ger
of Starving, if their numbers were not le&s;&s;en'd
by Pe&s;tilential Di&s;tempers. And notwith&s;tanding
the terrible Havock it makes, the Land is &s;till &s;o full
of People, that a Man wou'd think their own In|tere&s;t
&s;hou'd make 'em forbid the Exportation of
<HI>Corn,</HI> e&s;pecially &s;ince they have none to &s;pare.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXI.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Proceed now to give you an account of the
<HI>Manners</HI> and <HI>Cu&s;toms</HI> of the <HI>Turks,</HI> which (you
may remember) was the la&s;t of the three Subjects I
undertook to Di&s;cour&s;e of. I told you once before,
and I &s;hall take this occa&s;ion to repeat it as an
undoubted Truth, that they are oppo&s;ite to us al|mo&s;t
in every thing: And this Oppo&s;ition appears
in nothing more plainly, than in their ob&s;tinate
adhering to their ancient Cu&s;toms. In our Coun|try
we are never at re&s;t till we have Invented &s;ome
new fa&s;hion; and Beauty it &s;elf wou'd hardly
plea&s;e us without the Charms of Novelty. Hence
the <HI>Turks</HI> accu&s;e the <HI>Franks</HI> of Ficklene&s;s and In|con&s;tancy,
and boa&s;t of their own &s;trength of
Mind that fixes &s;teddily on &s;olid Enjoyments,
without deigning to take notice of Trifles. I con|fe&s;s
I was at fir&s;t &s;omewhat &s;urpriz'd at the dif|ference
I ob&s;erv'd between their Temper and ours,
but after I had taken all po&s;&s;ible care to free my
&s;elf of tho&s;e Prejudices that are wont in &s;uch ca&s;es
to put a bia&s;s upon the Judgment, and &s;eriou&s;ly
con&s;ider'd the Genius of that Nation; I found that
what they call <HI>Strength of Mind, Con&s;tancy,</HI> or <HI>Soli|dity,</HI>
is at the bottom nothing el&s;e but a pure <HI>in|&s;en&s;ibility,</HI>
and a <HI>Weakne&s;s</HI> that is altogether inexcu|&s;able
in any rea&s;onable Creature. And you will
certainly be of the &s;ame Opinion when I have told
you, that they are &s;o far from &s;tudying to improve
their Under&s;tandings, that in a manner they profe&s;s
and glory in their Ignorance; and that their Cu|rio&s;ity
is confin'd within &s;o narrow a compa&s;s, that
<PB N="262" REF="151">
they never undertake a Voyage without &s;ome co|vetous
or &s;ordid De&s;ign. Be&s;ides, their Indiffe|rence
and Unconcern'dne&s;s for the Public Intere&s;t;
the almo&s;t Mona&s;tical Solitarine&s;s of their Life,
and the Lazine&s;s of their Temper are convincing
Proofs of the truth of my A&s;&s;ertion. 'Tis true
indeed, this Character mu&s;t not be extended &s;o far
as to comprehend the Principal Officers of State,
or tho&s;e who are engag'd in Court-Intrigues: But
as for all the re&s;t, they &s;carce ever look beyond the
Sphere of their own Families: And provided their
Wives be hand&s;ome, their Hor&s;es well Curry'd, and
their Servants Submi&s;&s;ive and Re&s;pectful, they ne|ver
give them&s;elves the trouble of enquiring after
the Affairs of the re&s;t of the World. Contented
with their Lot, they &s;it whole Days on a <HI>Sopha,</HI>
without any other Occupation than drinking <HI>Coffee,</HI>
&s;moaking <HI>Tobacco,</HI> or care&s;&s;ing their <HI>Wives:</HI> So that
their whole Life is a continual Revolution of
<HI>Eating, Drinking,</HI> and <HI>Sleeping,</HI> intermixt with &s;ome
dull <HI>Recreations.</HI> Yet they cannot be accus'd of
Luxury in Eating, for a Hen boil'd with Rice,
Coriander-&s;eed, and Sugar is the be&s;t Di&s;h that
comes before a Man of 20000 Livres a Year, and
'tis this they call <HI>Pilo.</HI> The re&s;t of the Meal is
made up with a Di&s;h of Fi&s;h, and &s;ome Sweet-Meats,
in which there is always more Honey than
Sugar. When the Hour of Dinner comes, they
lay upon the <HI>Sopha</HI> an Octangular or Hexagonal
Table of Olive-Wood or Walnut-Tree, inlaid with
Ivory, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and u&s;ually not above a Foot and a
half in Diameter. Then having laid the Cloath,
they &s;erve up all the Di&s;hes one after another:
There are no Napkins laid upon the Table, but a
Servant &s;preads 'em on his Ma&s;ter's-Knees', and
&s;tands behind him to cut his Meat; for 'tis beneath
the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Grandeur to do any thing for them|&s;elves.
All their Ve&s;&s;els are of Earth; only the
<PB N="263" REF="151">
Great Men u&s;e Porcelain: For they reckon it a
very heinous Sin to eat in Silver, tho' the Trap|pings
of their Hor&s;es are u&s;ually of that Metal.
They never drink at Meals, tho' they are wont to &s;it
a con&s;iderable while; but a&s;&s;oon as the Table is
remov'd, the Servants bring a Cup of <HI>Sorbet,</HI> and
then <HI>Coffee,</HI> and <HI>Tobacco,</HI> with which they divert
them&s;elves all the re&s;t of the Day, unle&s;s they
take a fancy to go to the Women's Apart|ment,
or to play at <HI>Shells</HI> with one of their
Servants, who mu&s;t always &s;uffer him&s;elf to be
beaten, as he wou'd avoid a wor&s;e Beating with
a Cudgel. At Night there is a Mat brought, with
Sheets and a Coverlet; and they Sleep all Night in
the &s;ame place where they Eat, Drunk, Play'd, and
Doz'd all the Day: For they are altogether ig|norant
of the u&s;e of dark <HI>Alcoves,</HI> and Beds with
double Curtains. This is their con&s;tant manner of
Living, after they cea&s;e to be <HI>Youths;</HI> for betwixt
the Years of <HI>Fifteen</HI> and <HI>Twenty,</HI> they &s;pend their
Time in <HI>Riding, Archery,</HI> throwing <HI>Darts,</HI> and other
Exerci&s;es of that nature in which they u&s;ually at|tain
to a great Perfection. I do not think that we
have any Grooms or Jockeys in <HI>Europe</HI> that exceed
'em, tho' if you &s;aw 'em on Hor&s;eback, you
wou'd think they cou'd not &s;it a moment. For
their Stirrups are &s;o &s;hort, that they mu&s;t almo&s;t
bend their Legs as much as when they &s;it upon a
<HI>Sopha:</HI> Their Boots are of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> or <HI>Goat's</HI>-Lea|ther,
&s;o wide and ill-made, that nothing can be
more trouble&s;ome to a Hor&s;eman: and all the
Furniture of their Hor&s;es is &s;till more incommo|dious.
Their Saddles are as large and high as a
Pack-&s;addle, e&s;pecially before, and fa&s;ten'd on the
Hor&s;e's back, with a broad Girth or Surcingle
drawn over it, without which 'twou'd be impo&s;|&s;ible
to keep it from falling off, by rea&s;on of its
weight. In&s;tead of Bridles they u&s;e Snaffles that
<PB N="264" REF="152">
wou'd be thought bad enough for a Cart-Hor&s;e in
<HI>France,</HI> if they were not richly gilded. Judge, Sir,
what a Figure a Man can make on the back of a
Hor&s;e Trapp'd after &s;uch a manner, and what Com|mand
he can have over him. Yet I a&s;&s;ure you the
<HI>Turks</HI> rule their Hor&s;es as they plea&s;e, without either
Spur or Whip, in&s;tead of which they only u&s;e a
Stick or <HI>Batoon</HI> three Foot long, and as big as a very
large Cane, which they hold in the middle, &s;triking
the Hor&s;e &s;ometimes with one end, and &s;ometimes
with the other, according as they wou'd have him
turn to either &s;ide. I never &s;aw Hor&s;es run &s;o fa&s;t
as the&s;e, nor &s;tretch their Bodies to &s;o great a
length, for their Belly almo&s;t touches the Ground.
The <HI>Turks</HI> have an admirable dexterity at throwing
Darts on Hor&s;eback; for riding at a full Gallop,
they Dart their Sticks at a <HI>Turbant,</HI> which is &s;et up as
a Mark, without once mi&s;&s;ing their Aim. And
which is &s;till more &s;urprizing, they throw their
<HI>Batoon</HI> as far before 'em as they can, then putting
their Hor&s;e to the &s;wifte&s;t Gallop they take it up
with their Hand without &s;topping. You will ea&s;ily
perceive the extraordinary difficulty of &s;tooping &s;o
low to take the Stick from the Ground, if you re|member
what I told you of the extraordinary
heighth of their Saddles and lowne&s;s of their Stir|rups.
None but <HI>Turks</HI> are able to perform this
Feat of Activity, for the <HI>Franks</HI> are &s;o far from
being capable of Learning it, that they can hard|ly
ride the Hor&s;es of this Country. One of our
Merchants, newly come to this place, met with
an Accident t'other Day, that confirms the truth of
what I was &s;aying; for his Hor&s;e ran away with
him &s;o furiou&s;ly, that he cou'd not po&s;&s;ibly pull in
his Head; and I believe he wou'd have certainly
broke his Neck, if he had not been &s;top'd by a
<HI>Greek</HI> who happen'd to meet him. This proceeded
from his Ignorance of the way of &s;topping a Hor&s;e
<PB N="265" REF="152">
in this Country; for when a Hor&s;e runs away with a
Man, he mu&s;t never pull the Bridle, &s;ince that wou'd
only make him go the fa&s;ter; but take hold of one
of the Reins, and turn his Head to the Right-hand,
&s;triking him with the Rod on the other &s;ide.</P>
<P>'Tis none of the lea&s;t Conveniencies of this Coun|try,
that the Keeping of a <HI>Hor&s;e</HI> is &s;o cheap, that the
Charge of one does not amount to above 30 <HI>Pia&s;ters</HI> a
Year: 'Tis true they mu&s;t be very carefully tended,
and the <HI>Turks</HI> make it their principal Bu&s;ine&s;s to look
after 'em. They vi&s;it 'em very often, and when they
find 'em in a good Condition, the <HI>Sa&iuml;s</HI> is always
rewarded with &s;ome Care&s;&s;es; but if there be any
thing ami&s;s, he may certainly expect the <HI>Ba&s;ton|nado.</HI></P>
<P>Nor are their <HI>Servants</HI> more chargeable to 'em
than their Hor&s;es. Their <HI>Valets de Chambre</HI> co&s;t 'em
not above 40 <HI>Pia&s;ters</HI> a year, for Wages, be&s;ides
their Entertainment, which is incon&s;iderable: and
the Servants without the Hou&s;e, &s;uch as the <HI>Sa&iuml;s,
Porters,</HI> and <HI>Gardeners,</HI> have but 25. As for their
Entertainment, the Rate of their Board-Wages is
fixt at a <HI>Paras</HI> a day, be&s;ides Bread. The <HI>Paras</HI> is a
&s;mall Piece of cour&s;e Silver, not exceeding the Va|lue
of five <HI>Dutch Liards:</HI> and yet &s;ome of 'em are
&s;uch admirable Husbands, that they make a &s;hift to
&s;ave part of &s;o poor an Allowance.</P>
<P>I &s;hall in the next place proceed to give you an
Account of the u&s;ual <HI>Habit</HI> of the <HI>Men.</HI> Their
<HI>Breeches</HI> are long and wide, reaching down to
their Heels, and clo&s;e both behind and before, with
leathern Stockings or Socks fa&s;ten'd to the lower
part of 'em: and all this is call'd the <HI>Cha&s;cir.</HI> Their
<HI>Shirts</HI> are of very fine Cotton Cloth, made exactly
like a Woman's Smock, only they are much wider,
e&s;pecially at the Sleeves, which are always left open.
Over this, in&s;tead of a Wa&s;t-Coat, they wear a
<HI>Cafetan,</HI> which is a kind of a long Ca&s;&s;ock with
<PB N="266" REF="153">
narrow Sleeves, button'd at the Wri&s;ts, like the
Sleeves of our Doublets. In the Summer the <HI>Cafe|tans</HI>
are made of very white Cotton Cloth, and in
Winter of Silk Stuff quilted with Cotton. Be&s;ides,
they are girt about the Wa&s;te with a Silken Scarf,
re&s;embling Brocard, that &s;erves to hang their <HI>Gangi|are</HI>
or Poniard, the Handle of which is pretty large,
and oftentimes made of Ivory, the Teeth of a cer|tain
Fi&s;h, or Silver, and enrich'd with Jewels either
true or counterfeit. They never appear with a
<HI>Sword</HI> or <HI>Sabre,</HI> but when they go into the Coun|try:
nor are the <HI>Franks</HI> &s;uffer'd to wear one, except
the Amba&s;&s;adours and Con&s;uls.</P>
<P>Their upper Habit is a Cloth Gown, which they
call a <HI>Ve&s;t.</HI> In Summer 'tis only lin'd with <HI>Taffeta;</HI>
but in Winter 'tis furr'd with a Skin, call'd <HI>Samour,</HI>
which is &s;o co&s;tly that Great Per&s;ons have &s;ome that
are worth 1000 Crowns a piece. The Hair of it
is black, fine, and &s;o long, that one may hide
an Egg in it; I &s;peak only of the be&s;t &s;ort; for
there are &s;ome of all Prices. Be&s;ides they &s;ome|times
furr their Ve&s;ts with Ermins, or with the
Skin of a blui&s;h &s;ort of Wea&s;el, or of the <HI>Mu&s;co|via</HI>
Fox; and the poorer &s;ort with Kid, Foine,

on their Cloaths, unle&s;s on Days of Ceremony,
&s;uch as the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s publick Entry, their Wed|ding-Day,
or &s;ome &s;uch Solemnity: and even then
'tis the peculiar Privilege of the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI>'s and Grandees
of the Port, to wear Ornaments of that Nature.

Continency, are forc'd to make u&s;e of the Privi|lege
of Keeping <HI>Concubines,</HI> or buying <HI>Slaves.</HI> For
a Man mu&s;t not expect to live upon Charity here,
tho' the Women are not at all guilty of Cruelty:
but want of Opportunity hinders 'em from be&s;tow|ing
their Favours, and 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for a Gallant
to thrive among &s;uch cautious Husbands. There is
no Slavery equal to that of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Women;
for a Servant may live Twenty Years in a Family
without &s;eeing the Face of his Mi&s;tre&s;s. The Door
of the Womens Apartment is a <HI>Ne plus ultra</HI> for
every thing that looks like a Man, and the utmo&s;t
Limit of the Womens Liberty; I mean Women of
Quality, who have Baths in their Hou&s;es; for the
meaner Sort mu&s;t go to the public Baths at lea&s;t once
a Week. Notwith&s;tanding this clo&s;e Confinement,
I'm inform'd that they &s;ometimes venture upon a
little Recreation; but they are &s;eldom &s;o bold, and
the Motion mu&s;t always proceed from them&s;elves.
When they are in the Humour, and have cho|&s;en
a promi&s;ing Play-fellow, they &s;end him a
Declaration of Love by &s;ome old Confident. But
wou'd you not be &s;urpriz'd in&s;tead of a <HI>Billet-doux</HI>
to find nothing but Bits of <HI>Charcoal, Scarlet Cloth,
Saffron, A&s;hes,</HI> and &s;uch like Tra&s;h, wrapt up in a
Piece of Paper. 'Tis true the&s;e are as &s;ignificant as
the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate Words; but 'tis a My&s;tical Lan|guage
that cannot be under&s;tood without a <HI>Turki&s;h</HI>
Interpreter. I know a <HI>Frank</HI> that once receiv'd &s;uch
an Invitation, and was extremely puzzl'd to know
the Meaning of it. After &s;everal &s;ucce&s;sle&s;s Trials
to unriddle the My&s;tery, he entru&s;ted the Secret to
one of the Amba&s;&s;adour's Interpreters, who told
him that &s;uch a <HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI>'s Wife de&s;ir'd him to vi&s;it her
&s;uch a day, when her Husband wou'd be gone
from home, and that the Woman who brought him
the Me&s;&s;age wou'd introduce him to her Apartment.
At the &s;ame time he advis'd him not to go, and us'd
<PB N="269" REF="154">
all the Arguments that his Experience or Prudence
cou'd &s;ugge&s;t to di&s;&s;wade him from expo&s;ing him&s;elf
to &s;o terrible and unavoidable a Danger. But the
<HI>Frank</HI> had &s;uch a longing de&s;ire to ta&s;te &s;o delicious a
Bit as he fan&s;i'd his Unknown Mi&s;tre&s;s to be, that
he re&s;olv'd to &s;acrifice all to the Dear Expectation,
and went boldly to the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI>'s Hou&s;e at the time ap|pointed,
where he really found a kind and beautiful
Lady, who put him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his expected
Delight, and entertain'd him with all the Joys of
Love, for two days; at the end of which his
Strength being quite exhau&s;ted by the laborious Plea|&s;ure,
and finding him&s;elf altogether unfit for the Ser|vice,
he ask'd leave to be gone, and was extremely
&s;urpriz'd when his Reque&s;t was deny'd, in a very
har&s;h and uncivil Manner. Then beginning to reflect
on the Interpreter's wi&s;e Admonition; he walk'd
about the whole Apartment, &s;earching in every Cor|ner
for a place where he might e&s;cape unperceiv'd.
At la&s;t he came to the <HI>Laundry</HI> or Wa&s;hing-Hou&s;e,
where he found a Woman-Slave, who perceiving
his Melancholy, and gue&s;&s;ing the Cau&s;e of it, be|gan
to condole his Misfortune in a manner that
made him utterly de&s;pair of Relief. For &s;he told
him that 'twas her Mi&s;tre&s;s's con&s;tant Practice to
&s;ecure her own Reputation by the Death of her Lo|vers;
adding, that to her certain Knowledge above
<HI>Twenty</HI> of 'em had been &s;trangl'd &s;ince &s;he came in|to
the Family, and that he cou'd not rea&s;onably ex|pect
a milder Treatment than his Predece&s;&s;ors had
met with before him. <HI>Yet,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>&s;ince we are both</HI>
Chri&s;tians, <HI>I'll endeavour to &s;ave your Life, if you do
not force me to hate you by refu&s;ing to grant me one Fa|vour.
I have been &s;hut up in this place the&s;e Twenty
Years, and in all that time have not &s;een the Face of
a Man:</HI> Oblige <HI>me but once, and afterwards I &s;hall
find a way to &s;et you at Liberty.</HI> The Terms were
&s;omewhat hard for a Man in his Condition; but
&s;ince his Life was at &s;take, he made a Vertue of Ne|ce&s;&s;ity,
<PB N="270" REF="155">
and <HI>perform'd</HI> as well as he cou'd. The
poor Woman, who had been a Stranger &s;o long to
the Plea&s;ure of Love, was ravi&s;h'd with the unac|cu&s;tom'd
Delight; and having given him a thou|&s;and
Ble&s;&s;ings, help'd him to make his E&s;cape thro'
the Chimney, which brought him to a Platform,
from whence he leap'd into the Street, and has ne|ver
&s;ince found the lea&s;t Inclination to make Love to
a <HI>Turki&s;h Lady;</HI> which is certainly the mo&s;t dange|rous
Recreation that a <HI>Frank</HI> can chu&s;e. The <HI>Turks</HI>
require &s;o much Mode&s;ty and Di&s;cretion in their
Wives, that they wou'd never pardon 'em if they
&s;hou'd &s;uffer a Man to <HI>&s;ee</HI> 'em, or <HI>&s;peak</HI> to 'em:
and I &s;hall never forget what an <HI>Aga</HI> once &s;aid to
<HI>Mon&s;ieur de Chateauneuf</HI>'s Secretary. This Gentleman
was telling the <HI>Aga</HI> after the <HI>French</HI> way, that is very
<HI>indi&s;creetly,</HI> that he had &s;een and &s;poken with one
of <HI>Mahomet the Fourth</HI>'s <HI>Odali&s;che's,</HI> who was turn'd
out of the <HI>Seraglio</HI> after that Prince's Misfortune.
The <HI>Turk,</HI> who cou'd not hear him longer with Pa|tience,
reply'd very angrily, that &s;he was a ba&s;e Wo|man,
and unworthy of her former Dignity. Then
the <HI>Secretary</HI> endeavour'd to per&s;uade him that &s;he
had no ill De&s;ign in what &s;he did, and that 'twas
only an innocent Curio&s;ity that made her willing to
be inform'd of the <HI>French</HI> Cu&s;toms, of the Beauty
of the Ladies in that Country, and of their Way
of Living. But the <HI>Aga,</HI> in&s;tead of being pacify'd,
continu'd to rail again the <HI>Odali&s;che</HI> &s;o vehemently,
that the <HI>Secretary</HI> began to repent his Freedom, and
to &s;wear and prote&s;t that &s;he was one of the mo&s;t
vertuous Per&s;ons in the World, and that &s;he was not
guilty of the lea&s;t criminal Thought. At la&s;t the
<HI>Aga,</HI> lo&s;ing all Patience, reply'd in a Rage; <HI>Sir, All
that you have &s;aid &s;ignifies nothing. If &s;he had been
hone&s;t, &s;he wou'd never have &s;uffer'd you to &s;ee her,
much le&s;s to &s;peak to her. If a Man &s;hou'd put his
<PB N="271" REF="155">
Hand into your Pocket, wou'd you excu&s;e him for &s;ay|ing
that he did it out of pure Curio&s;ity.</HI></P>
<P>Since I have had occa&s;ion &s;o often to mention the
<HI>Turki&s;h Women,</HI> 'twill not be improper to give you
&s;ome Account of their <HI>Habit,</HI> which is not much
different from that of the <HI>Men,</HI> only 'tis a great
deal richer. They wear a <HI>Cafetan</HI> of Gold-Brocard,
fa&s;ten'd before with large Pearls, or little Knots of
Diamonds. It covers their Shoulders entirely, but
'tis cut &s;o deep before, that their whole Brea&s;ts
wou'd remain naked, if their <HI>Smock,</HI> and a little
fort of <HI>Wa&s;te-Coat</HI> that comes over it, did not hide a
part of 'em. This <HI>Wa&s;te-Coat</HI> &s;its very clo&s;e to the
Body, and keeps up the Brea&s;ts, which is a great
Conveniency to tho&s;e who&s;e Brea&s;ts are naturally
loo&s;e and &s;wagging: &s;o that all Defects are con|ceal'd,
and the mo&s;t curious Eye can perceive no|thing
but <HI>enchanting Beauties.</HI> Above the <HI>Cafetan</HI>
they wear a <HI>Leathern Girdle,</HI> cover'd with Plates and
Studs of Gold and Silver, and enrich'd with preci|ous
Stones that ca&s;t a great Lu&s;tre. Their <HI>Smock</HI> is
always of the fine&s;t flower'd Silk, and hangs over
their <HI>Chac&s;ir,</HI> which in Summer is only made of the
&s;ame Silk, by rea&s;on of the exce&s;&s;ive Heat. Every
prudent <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> ought to keep his Eyes from glan|cing
that way; if it be po&s;&s;ible for any Man to
pre&s;erve his Rea&s;on at the Sight of the enflaming
Object, for this Stuff, which is no thicker than Tif|fany
or Gawze, gives the ravi&s;h'd Beholder an al|mo&s;t
unclouded View of all the mo&s;t charming
Beauties that are &s;o carefully conceal'd by our La|dies.
Their upper <HI>Ve&s;t</HI> is either of Cloth or Velvet
embroider'd, or of &s;ome rich &s;ort of Cloth of Gold:
In Summer 'tis furr'd with <HI>Ermin,</HI> and in Winter
with <HI>Samour.</HI> Their <HI>Head-Dre&s;s</HI> is &s;o magnificent
and becoming, that you can hardly form a &s;uitable
Idea of it unle&s;s you had &s;een it; tho' the follow|ing
De&s;cription may in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;atisfie your
<PB N="272" REF="156">
Curio&s;ity. Their <HI>Talpo</HI> is a pretty long Velvet-Cap,
made of Eight Pieces, the outward Circle being
ju&s;t large enough to receive the Head; but it widens
by degrees towards the Top, not unlike to a clo&s;e
Crown. 'Tis adorn'd with the riche&s;t Embroidery
of Gold, Silver, and Pearls: and is &s;o long, that it
wou'd fall back upon the Shoulders, if it were not
very artificially rais'd above the Head, where they
pleit and fold it with as much Care as our Ladies do
their <HI>Fontanges</HI> and <HI>Top-Knots.</HI> 'Tis al&s;o enrich'd
with long Strings of Pearls curiou&s;ly interwoven,
and &s;trew'd with Diamonds, Rubies, and all &s;orts
of Jewels, be&s;ides one or two <HI>Aigrets</HI> of Diamonds.
To keep it up they bind it about the Head with a
<HI>Frontlet,</HI> about two Fingers breadth broad, and &s;o
rich, that it may be fitly call'd a <HI>Diadem;</HI> for 'tis
cover'd all over with Gold and Precious Stones.
Round this <HI>Frontlet</HI> there are little Gold Chains,
with a Diamond hanging at one, an Emerald at
another, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which dangle upon the Forehead, and
on both &s;ides of the Face. I need not tell you that
&s;uch magnificent Dre&s;&s;es are only us'd by <HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI>'s
Wives, for tho' Jewels are cheaper here than in <HI>Eu|rope,</HI>
they are &s;till &s;o chargeable, that it requires a
very con&s;iderable E&s;tate to make &s;o great a Figure.
However I can a&s;&s;ure you that every Woman, ac|cording
to her Ability, decks her &s;elf to the be&s;t
Advantage; and the whole Dowry, or the Money
that is given by the Father, is laid out on Orna|ments
for the Bride. But when a Woman's Porti|on
is not &s;ufficient to purcha&s;e &s;o many Jewels, &s;he
mu&s;t content her &s;elf with a plain <HI>Frontlet</HI> of Gold,
or Silver-gilt; and &s;ome that cannot reach &s;o high,
only tye an embroider'd Handkerchief about their
<HI>Talpo's,</HI> which is the Dre&s;s of the poore&s;t Sort, and
even the meane&s;t <HI>Cobler</HI>'s Wife will not appear with|out
it. As for their <HI>Hair,</HI> they make it up into a
long Tre&s;s, about the breadth of four Fingers, that
<PB N="273" REF="156">
falls backward, and &s;ometimes reaches to their
Heels; and they who&s;e Hair is not becoming, en|deavour
to &s;upply that Defect, by mixing fal&s;e
Hair among it. Be&s;ides, there is a little Curl on
each &s;ide of the Forehead, that runs along the Face:
And they are very careful to keep the&s;e Curls in
Order, and to dye 'em Black with a certain Com|po&s;ition,
that &s;erves al&s;o to dye their <HI>Brows,</HI> which
are always extremely hand&s;ome: For they take
care to have 'em &s;hap'd with a Razor, and after|wards
apply to the &s;hav'd Parts a certain Pa&s;te,
call'd <HI>Pilo,</HI> which hinders the Hair from grow|ing.</P>
<P>In <HI>Turkey,</HI> as well as in <HI>Europe,</HI> the Women generally
<HI>Paint;</HI> for tho' they're a&s;ham'd to acknowledge it, I
met with a <HI>Greeki&s;h</HI> Woman, who &s;crupl'd not to con|fe&s;s
that few of her Sex ab&s;tain from that Cu&s;tom.
Their <HI>White Paint</HI> is a &s;ort of very thick Grea&s;e, which
I cannot de&s;cribe, &s;ince I had not the Curio&s;ity to
enquire how they make it. But as for their <HI>Red
Paint,</HI> 'tis nothing el&s;e but <HI>Cochineel,</HI> prepar'd with
<HI>Cream of Tartar,</HI> and boil'd &s;o long till there re|mains
only a Tenth Part of the Compo&s;ition.
They u&s;e it with &s;o much Succe&s;s, that I believe it
might &s;erve for <HI>Spani&s;h Vermilion,</HI> and even is, in
my Opinion, more natural. They al&s;o Paint their
Nails Red, but not with <HI>Cochineel.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Women are the mo&s;t charming
Creatures in the World: They &s;eem to be made
for Love; their Actions, Ge&s;tures, Di&s;cour&s;e, and
Looks are all Amorous, and admirably well fitted
to kindle a &s;oft and la&s;ting Pa&s;&s;ion. Since they
have nothing el&s;e to do, they make it their only
Bu&s;ine&s;s to <HI>Plea&s;e;</HI> which they do &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully,
and in &s;o natural and ea&s;ie a Manner, that few
Husbands take the benefit of the Law, that allows
'em to divorce their Wives when they plea&s;e. This
&s;eems &s;o &s;trange and &s;urprizing, that I cannot for|bear
<PB N="274" REF="157">
reckoning it a &s;ort of Prodigy, when I reflect
on the <HI>Genius</HI> of all other Nations: For Men are
u&s;ually quite cloy'd with the Plea&s;ures of Matri|mony
in three or four Years; and if a Maid had
nothing el&s;e but her Per&s;on to recommend her to
a Husband, &s;he might e'en de&s;pair of ever ta&s;ting
the lawful Joys of the Bed. Whereas in this Coun|try,
in&s;tead of enriching or maintaining their Hu&s;|bands,
they put 'em to &s;o prodigious a Charge,
that none but Per&s;ons of high Quality are able to
keep four Wives. The extreme Neatne&s;s of the
<HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Women is none of their lea&s;t con&s;iderable
Charms; and this extraordinary Cleanne&s;s is an
effect of their Bathing at lea&s;t once a Week; for
the nicer &s;ort bathe twice. I think I told you be|fore
that Women of Quality have the convenien|cy
of Bathing at Home; and that the re&s;t go to
the common Baths. I mu&s;t now add, that the
Virtue, and even the Mode&s;ty of a Woman is as
&s;ecure in the Public, as in the Private Baths; for
Men are forbidden to enter into the&s;e Sacred Pla|ces
under pain of Death. The&s;e Baths are large
Halls built of Marble, and cover'd with vaulted
Roofs in form of <HI>Domes;</HI> on the Top of which there
are Gla&s;s-Windows to let in the Light, without
&s;uffering the Heat to evaporate. There are no
Windows in the Walls, that the Women may
undre&s;s them&s;elves without fear of expo&s;ing their
Naked Beauties to the Ob&s;ervation of &s;ome Curi|ous
Enquirer into the Works of Nature; and be|&s;ides,
they take care to cover their Di&s;tingui&s;hing
Parts with a Cloth wrapt about their Belly, and
tied on the Back. Then they Sweat a quarter of
an Hour or longer; and for the Conveniency of
tho&s;e who are de&s;irous to bathe in Water, there
is in the &s;ame Place a Va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> or Bathing-Tub,
which they fill with hot Water by turning a Cock,
tempering and allaying it when 'tis exce&s;&s;ively
<PB N="275" REF="157">
hot, by turning another Cock that lets in cold
Water. There are Waiting-Women always ready
to attend tho&s;e who come to bathe, who for a
&s;mall Reward crack all the Joynts of their Arms,
Legs, and Thighs. At the &s;ame time they anoint
the hairy Parts of the Body with <HI>Pilo,</HI> which makes
the Hair fall off, and leaves the Skin extremely
white and &s;mooth. The Men have their Baths
apart, and are &s;erv'd after the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>There are three &s;orts of <HI>Recreations</HI> us'd by the
<HI>Turks; Gaming, Mu&s;ick,</HI> and <HI>Dancing.</HI> You may
perceive by the Account I gave you of their <HI>Games,</HI>
that they are neither Plea&s;ant nor Ingenious: And
I &s;hall take this occa&s;ion to tell you, that their <HI>Mu|&s;ick</HI>
is rather a hideous Dinn than a regular Har|mony,
and re&s;embles exactly the howling Shrieks
of a tortur'd Wretch. The fir&s;t time I heard a
<HI>Turk</HI> &s;ing, I cou'd not forbear &s;topping to look up|on
him, concluding that he was certainly Mad:
For I cou'd not imagine that a Man who had the
u&s;e of his Rea&s;on, wou'd take plea&s;ure in di&s;tort|ing
his Body, and rolling his Eyes in &s;o odd and
extravagant a manner; tho' they pretend that all
tho&s;e unu&s;ual Motions are only the Marks and
Effects of a tender and violent Pa&s;&s;ion. Their <HI>Mu|&s;ical
In&s;truments</HI> are extremely &s;uitable to the Na|ture
of their Harmony: For they have a kind of
<HI>Violin</HI> with three Strings, a Neck as long as a Man's
Arm, and a great Belly like the Block of a Hat;
&s;ome ill-contriv'd <HI>Flutes;</HI> little <HI>Timbrels</HI> about the
bigne&s;s of one's Fi&s;t, a <HI>Drum,</HI> &s;ome paultry <HI>Haut|bois,</HI>
and &s;everal little Brazen <HI>Targets,</HI> which they
hold in their Hands, and knock again&s;t one ano|ther.
Judge, Sir, what a mad Con&s;ort they make
with the confus'd jangling of &s;o many inharmoni|ous
In&s;truments. The only tolerable In&s;trument
they have is the <HI>P&s;alterion,</HI> which is cover'd with
Latten Strings, &s;tretcht as upon a <HI>Harp&s;ical;</HI> and
<PB N="276" REF="158">
they &s;trike upon 'em with little Sticks, which
they hold betwixt their two Fingers. All the Wo|men
play admirably well on this In&s;trument, for
'tis their u&s;ual Diver&s;ion in their Chambers, e|&s;pecially
the <HI>Greeks,</HI> who&s;e Mu&s;ick may be heard
with Plea&s;ure, &s;ince 'tis a great deal more agree|able
than that of the <HI>Turks.</HI> I &s;hall only add on
this Subject, that neither of 'em &s;ing the Notes
without the Words; and our way of &s;inging
Tunes &s;eems &s;o ridiculous to 'em, that they u&s;ual|ly
laugh at the <HI>Franks,</HI> and ask 'em what their
<HI>Tartara lera</HI> &s;ignifies.</P>
<P>Their <HI>Dances</HI> are al&s;o of different kinds. Tho&s;e
which are us'd by Per&s;ons of Quality are taught by
Ma&s;ters and Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, the fir&s;t being appointed to
teach Men, and the others Women. Tho' they
are all very grave, there is a great deal of Action
requir'd in the Hands and Arms; and the fine&s;t
part of the Dance con&s;i&s;ts in the graceful and dex|terous
Motions of tho&s;e Parts: For the Beauty
and Nicene&s;s of the Step cannot be well di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd
by rea&s;on of tho&s;e trouble&s;ome <HI>Chac&s;irs</HI> that
hide the whole Legs. The <HI>Turks</HI> never give any
Balls, for they always Dance &s;ingle; and the Dan|cing
of two Per&s;ons together wou'd be reckon'd
a Crime, or at lea&s;t an indecency among 'em.
Thus after one Per&s;on has entertain'd the Compa|ny
for &s;ome time, the Spectators expre&s;s their Ap|probation
by repeated clapping of Hands. Be&s;ides
'tis to be ob&s;erv'd, that the Women never Dance
but when they are invited to the Wedding of &s;ome
of their Relations, or when they make a familiar
Vi&s;it to &s;ome of their She-Friends, which happens
very unfrequently. Yet there are &s;ome Publick
Dancing-Women, who go to Private Families
when they are call'd, and Dance before 'em in
the mo&s;t La&s;civious manner imaginable: For they

with which they beat the Walls and Ground in a
furious and terrible Manner, and continue tho&s;e
violent Agitations of their Feet, Hands, and Head,
till their Wearine&s;s and want of Strength oblige
them to give over; and even &s;ometimes they Dance
till they fall down in a &s;ort of Exta&s;ie or Fit of
Dizzine&s;s. I had the Plea&s;ure to &s;ee all tho&s;e va|rious
kinds of Dances at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> in Mon&s;ieur
<HI>de Chateauneuf</HI>'s Hou&s;e, on the Day appointed to &s;o|lemnize
the Publick Joy for the advantageous Suc|ce&s;s
of the Campagne again&s;t the <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI> And
the&s;e Diver&s;ions were &s;ucceeded by a certain odd
kind of Show, perform'd by the <HI>Jews.</HI> Since all
&s;orts of Figures are an abomination to the <HI>Turks,</HI>
there were <HI>Puppets</HI> repre&s;ented in Shadows on the
Wall, which Danc'd and Sung to the Satisfaction
of all the Company, as it appear'd by their Laugh|ing
and plea&s;ant Humour. I cou'd not under&s;tand
the Words of their Songs, but if I may be allow'd
to judge of their Expre&s;&s;ions by their Po&s;tures,
they were certainly very ob&s;cene; for I never &s;aw
any thing &s;o bruti&s;h as the Repre&s;entations of tho&s;e
Shadows. Nor will this appear &s;trange to tho&s;e
<PB N="278" REF="160">
who con&s;ider that the <HI>Turks</HI> are more addicted to
that infamous Vice for which <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrha</HI>
were de&s;troy'd, than any other Nation in the
World; and that the Advancement of one half
of the great Officers in the Empire, is an Effect of
their ba&s;e Complai&s;ance to their bea&s;tly Patrons.
Thus the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Songs are doubly naufeous to
the <HI>Franks,</HI> who are not accu&s;tom'd to &s;uch horrid
Impurities.</P>
<P>The <HI>Puppet-Show</HI> was follow'd by another of
almo&s;t the &s;ame Nature. Four <HI>Jews</HI> ty'd certain
Sticks cro&s;s-wi&s;e to their Wri&s;ts and Feet, and
clothing them like Men and Women, plac'd them|&s;elves
all under one Covering; then the fir&s;t &s;tretch|ing
out one of his Arms, made the half Figures
Dance and Sing; after him came another; then a
third; and at la&s;t the eight Arms of the four <HI>Jews</HI>
perform'd &s;everal extravagant Motions on the Co|vering,
accompany'd with a confus'd Din; after
which they &s;tood upon their Heads, and di&s;cover|ing
eight larger Figures that were fa&s;tned to their
Feet, entertain'd the Company with another Show
exactly like the former.</P>
<P>I had occa&s;ion in &s;ome of my former Letters to
mention the re&s;t of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Cu&s;toms; and you
may conclude that what I have omitted is either
incon&s;iderable, or very particularly de&s;crib'd by o|ther
Travellers. And therefore I &s;hall conclude this
Subject after I have added one or two Ob&s;ervati|ons
concerning their <HI>Civility.</HI> They &s;eldom make
any Vi&s;its, but when they come to treat of Bu&s;i|ne&s;s;
and tho&s;e who do are always entertain'd
with <HI>Perfumes, Coffee,</HI> and <HI>Sherbet,</HI> as in the Account I
gave you of Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Cha&s;teauneuf</HI>'s Reception at
the <HI>Caimacan</HI>'s Hou&s;e. The Left-hand is reckon'd
the Place of Honour, becau&s;e 'tis next the Heart;
and when they &s;alute, in&s;tead of pulling off their
Turbants, they lay their Hands upon their Brea&s;t,
<PB N="279" REF="160">
and at the &s;ame time bow their Bodies, which
they repeat &s;everal times when they wou'd expre&s;s a
more than ordinary Affection to the Per&s;on whom
they &s;alute. This is the whole Ceremony of a
&s;imple Salutation; but when they intend to &s;how a
profound Re&s;pect, they mu&s;t not only lay their
Hand upon their Brea&s;t, but make &s;everal low Bows,
and with all the &s;igns of Humility ki&s;s the lower
part of the Per&s;on's Ve&s;t; after which they &s;tand
upright, and continue &s;till to keep their Hand up|on
their Brea&s;t, or even &s;ometimes both Hands, while
they are in the pre&s;ence of him whom they wou'd
re&s;pect. When he goes abroad, they mu&s;t make a
Lane for him, as they &s;ee his Servants do, and &s;a|lute
him with a low Bow as he pa&s;&s;es by. Be&s;ides,
in the Ab&s;ence of the Servants, they u&s;ually pre|&s;ent
their Hands to hold him under the Arms when
he goes up or down Stairs, or Mounts his Hor&s;e,
and on &s;ome other Occa&s;ions of the &s;ame Nature;
But when his Servants are pre&s;ent, 'tis their Office
to offer their A&s;&s;i&s;tance to their Ma&s;ter. When a
<HI>Frank</HI> makes a Vi&s;it to his <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Friends, they &s;till
pre&s;ent him with a <HI>Pipe</HI> after his <HI>Coffee;</HI> which is a
very trouble&s;om piece of Civility to tho&s;e who have
&s;o &s;trong an Aver&s;ion to <HI>Tobacco</HI> as I have, e&s;pecial|ly
con&s;idering the peremptory Stiffne&s;s of the <HI>Turks,</HI>
who will not admit of the mo&s;t rea&s;onable Excu&s;e.
Some great Per&s;ons &s;moak a &s;ort of perfum'd <HI>To|bacco,</HI>
like that of which <HI>Spani&s;h Snuff</HI> is made; but
our <HI>Franks</HI> never u&s;e any of that kind.</P>
<P>I have had occa&s;ion five or &s;ix times to &s;peak
of their <HI>Per&s;ons of Quality,</HI> without acquainting you
with the Nature of their Grandeur and Nobility;
and therefore I &s;hall conclude this Letter with a
&s;hort Account of it. You mu&s;t not imagine that
the&s;e are Per&s;ons of an Ancient and Noble Extra|ction;
for tho' there may be &s;ome of 'em that are
honourably de&s;cended, the greate&s;t part of 'em
<PB N="280" REF="161">
owe their Advancement merely to Fortune, or
are the Creatures of &s;ome <HI>Ba&s;&s;a;</HI> and their fir&s;t
Preferments are only the Rewards of their Ser|vice.
Thus we frequently &s;ee that a poor Slave
is advanc'd by degrees to the highe&s;t Dignities
in the Empire; and it may be &s;aid in the ge|neral,
that Riches are the Fountain of Honour in
<HI>Turkey.</HI> This Reflexion puts me in Mind of a blunt
Repartee that was made to the Marque&s;s <HI>de la
Marzelliere</HI> by one of the&s;e Pretenders to Nobility.
This Marque&s;s was de&s;cended of one of the mo&s;t
illu&s;trious Families in <HI>Bretaigne,</HI> and yet &s;crupl'd
not to marry a Citizen's Daughter of St. <HI>Malo's,</HI>
who brought him a Portion of Two hundred thou|&s;and
Pounds. However, it &s;eems, her Brother, who&s;e
Fortune was equal to hers, did not think him&s;elf
much honour'd by this Allyance; for imagining
that the Lu&s;tre of his Gold was bright enough to
make amends for the Ob&s;curity of his Birth, he
wou'd never be per&s;uaded to &s;hew the lea&s;t re&s;pect
to his Brother-in-Law. One Day as they were di|&s;puting
about &s;ome Points of Honour, after &s;everal
angry Replies, he told the Marque&s;s he knew no
Rea&s;on why he &s;hou'd be &s;o proud of a Title, and
at la&s;t added, that he was as good a Marque&s;s as
him&s;elf. <HI>Marque&s;s of what?</HI> &s;aid Mon&s;ieur <HI>de la Mar|zelliere;
Of what?</HI> reply'd he, <HI>I'm Marque&s;s of Two
Hundred Thou&s;and Crowns in good Lewis d'Ors.</HI></P>
<P>I have made it my Bu&s;ine&s;s to be acquainted with
the Arch-Bi&s;hop of this Place, who is a Per&s;on of
Wit and Merit, and has given me a particular Ac|count
of the principal Differences between the <HI>Grae|cian</HI>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFter the general <HI>Idea</HI> I have given you of the
Religion and Cu&s;toms of the <HI>Turks,</HI> you will
perhaps expect an Account of their <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Sub|jects,
the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and read with plea&s;ure &s;ome Re|marks
on a Subject of which I have often ob&s;erv'd
that even the more inqui&s;itive part of our <HI>European</HI>
World have but a very &s;light and confus'd Noti|on.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Condition of this Nation is &s;o mi|&s;erable,
and &s;o apt to produce all the mo&s;t
tender Motions of Compa&s;&s;ion in tho&s;e who &s;e|riou&s;ly
reflect upon it, that 'twou'd be needle&s;s to
heighten the Gloomine&s;s of the Pro&s;pect by com|paring
it with their former Glory, which after a
long and fatal Eclip&s;e, was re&s;tor'd to its ancient
Splendor by <HI>Con&s;tantine the Great,</HI> who&s;e Memory
will la&s;t till the final Period of the World. But
the Empire of the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> which he founded, and u|nited
to that of the <HI>We&s;t,</HI> was divided again after
his Death, and continu'd in a declining Condition
till the final Overthrow of the <HI>Palaeologi</HI> by the <HI>Turks,</HI>
in the Fifteenth Age; &s;ince which time the <HI>Greeks</HI>
have &s;till been Slaves in a Country of which they
were formerly Sovereigns; and to redeem them|&s;elves
from the Yoak under which they are born,
they are forc'd to pay a yearly Tribute, call'd the
<HI>Carache,</HI> which is only impos'd upon them, and
their Fellow-Slaves the <HI>Jews.</HI> The <HI>Carache</HI> is a per|petual
Poll-Tax, and exceeds not four <HI>Pia&s;ters</HI> a
Man; and yet &s;ince 'tis a Mark of their Bondage,
they have left no Means une&s;&s;ay'd to deliver them|&s;elves
<PB N="282" REF="162">
from it, and have even offer'd to rai&s;e more
con&s;iderable Summs another way. Be&s;ides, there
are oftentimes large <HI>Avanies</HI> impos'd upon 'em,
which they levy among them&s;elves, according to
the proportion of their E&s;tates. All their Patri|archs,
Bi&s;hops, and Abbots are al&s;o oblig'd to pay
for their Patents; and the Prices that are exacted
of 'em cannot but amount to a very con&s;ide|rable
Summ, &s;ince there are above five Thou&s;and
Arch-Bi&s;hops and Bi&s;hops in the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Empire,
who, reckoning one with another, pay above
two Thou&s;and <HI>Pia&s;ters</HI> a-piece, as a Fine to the
<HI>Grand Signior.</HI> The <HI>Greeks</HI> are naturally Proud,
and lovers of Pomp and Magnificence: Mo&s;t of
'em &s;pend higher than their E&s;tates will bear, and
are very fond of the Title of <HI>Chelety</HI> or <HI>Lord.</HI> Yet
even the riche&s;t of 'em, of which there is a con&s;i|derable
Number, are look'd upon as Objects of
Scorn and Contempt by the <HI>Turks.</HI> 'Tis true, they
are not in&s;en&s;ible of their Slavery, and perhaps
wou'd willingly &s;hake off the in&s;upportable Yoak
of their Domineering Ma&s;ters; but the Natural
Impatience of their Temper is more than &s;ufficient|ly
curb'd by their Weakne&s;s, and want of Power;
and they mu&s;t e'en content them&s;elves with repi|ning
in &s;ecret at the re&s;i&s;tle&s;s Tyranny of their Op|pre&s;&s;ors:
For they are &s;eldom or never able to ob|tain
Satisfaction for the Injuries they receive from
the <HI>Turks,</HI> if the Offenders are not wholly de&s;titute
both of Friends and Money.</P>
<P>The Habit of the <HI>Greeks</HI> is very different from
that of the <HI>Turks.</HI> They are not permitted to wear
a white <HI>Turbant;</HI> nor mu&s;t their <HI>Turbants</HI> be of the
&s;ame bigne&s;s with tho&s;e that are us'd by the <HI>Turks,</HI>
nor folded after the &s;ame manner: For they only
wrap a little piece of Cour&s;e Cloth, either blue or
&s;trip'd with blue, two or three times about their
Caps; and even u&s;ually they wear none at all, but
<PB N="283" REF="162">
content them&s;elves with a little red Cap which is
not large enough to cover their Ears. In&s;tead of a
Ve&s;t they have only a plain Wa&s;t-coat, which is ve|ry
&s;hort, and open before; and over that they
wear another that meets on the &s;ide. Neither ought
they to wear a <HI>Chac&s;ir</HI> after the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Fa&s;hion; for
their Breeches are very &s;hort, and reach not below
the Knee. And be&s;ides, they are di&s;tingui&s;h'd
from the <HI>Turks</HI> by their red <HI>Babouches;</HI> for tho&s;e
that are us'd by the <HI>Turks</HI> are yellow. Thus I have
given you a &s;hort Account of the Habit of the
<HI>Greeks;</HI> but tho' mo&s;t of 'em do, and all of 'em are
oblig'd to wear it, &s;ome of the richer &s;ort are &s;o
far from ob&s;erving the&s;e Regulations, that they can
&s;carce be di&s;tingui&s;h'd from the <HI>Turks</HI> but by their
<HI>Turbants:</HI> And even all Per&s;ons of Note, whether
<HI>Franks</HI> or <HI>Greeks,</HI> put on white <HI>Turbants</HI> when they
go out of the City, as I have had occa&s;ion to &s;ee
above fifty times. The <HI>Turks</HI> have of late conniv'd
at tho&s;e Innovations; but they have &s;till &s;uch a
veneration for <HI>Green,</HI> that the <HI>Greeks</HI> dare not pre|&s;ume
to wear it: nor wou'd it be &s;afe for <HI>Franks</HI>
to wear Green in the mid&s;t of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> tho' I
have often &s;een 'em make bold with that &s;acred Co|lour.
Since the Women are generally invi&s;ible,
they are not oblig'd to ob&s;erve the&s;e Marks of Di|&s;tinction;
and the only difference between their
Habit and way of Dre&s;&s;ing, and that of the <HI>Turks,</HI>
is that they mu&s;t, as well as the Men, ab&s;tain from
wearing <HI>Green.</HI> Nor is there a le&s;s Re&s;emblance be|tween
'em in their Manners and Cu&s;toms, and in
their &s;olitary way of living; tho' they find &s;o much
&s;weetne&s;s in the Freedom that prevails among us,
that they who&s;e Husbands or Fathers have frequent
Occa&s;ions to conver&s;e with <HI>Franks,</HI> are ea&s;ily di&s;|pos'd
to renounce their wonted Severity. They are
lovers of Plea&s;ures, Dancing, and magnificent Ha|bits;
and will fix a Pa&s;&s;ion upon a Man whether
<PB N="284" REF="163">
he will or not. But the poor <HI>Frank</HI> that &s;uffers
him&s;elf to be noos'd, mu&s;t re&s;olve either to be
Hen-peck'd, or a Cuckold: He mu&s;t adore his
<HI>Graecian</HI> Spou&s;e; he mu&s;t furni&s;h her with the rich|e&s;t
Habits, and keep a numerous Train of Slaves to
attend her; or, if any of the&s;e things be wanting,
<HI>'Ware Horns.</HI> For the <HI>Franks</HI> have an excellent Fa|culty
at curing a hand&s;ome Lady of the grumbling
Di&s;ea&s;e, and are always ready to do a kind Office
to a Country-man's Wife.</P>
<P>The <HI>Greek</HI> Dances are extremely plea&s;ant, and
full of Mirth. They are of two kinds: The fir&s;t
is a &s;ort of Country-Dance or <HI>Couranto,</HI> danc'd by
Pairs; and the &s;econd a kind of <HI>Gavote</HI> or <HI>Branle,</HI>
in which the Men and Women are mingl'd, as
at <HI>Pa&s;&s;epied</HI> in <HI>France;</HI> only you mu&s;t hold in your
right-hand the Left-hand of your Left-hand Wo|man,

Gay and Amorous: For the Women leaping on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
Step forwards, draw their Bodies backwards with a
certain pretty Turn that cannot be call'd immo|de&s;t,
yet gives a Man occa&s;ion to think of &s;ome|thing
more than he &s;ees. And be&s;ides, the Mu|&s;ick
contributes very much to the plea&s;antne&s;s of
their Dances, for their Tunes are extremely Brisk
and Airy.</P>

<PB N="285" REF="164">
The fitte&s;t time to take the plea&s;ure of viewing
their way of Dancing, is when they are met at a
Wedding; for on &s;uch Occa&s;ions they give them|&s;elves
up to Joy and Plea&s;ure, drinking, eating,
and &s;porting, and indulging them&s;elves in all man|ner
of Diver&s;ions. The next Morning the young
Woman's Relations make a Vi&s;it to the new|marry'd
Couple, and examine the Bridegroom con|cerning
his Wife's Virginity: Then they take the
Bride's Bloody Smock, and expo&s;e it to the View
of all the Company, as if it were &s;ome rare Cu|rio&s;ity.
The <HI>Jews</HI> ob&s;erve the &s;ame Cu&s;tom at the
Marriage of a Maid, and are even nicer and
more &s;crupulous in this Point than the <HI>Greeks;</HI>
for if the Bride's Hone&s;ty be not confirm'd by the
Blood that appears on her Smock, her Reputation
is irrecoverably lo&s;t, and &s;he is immediately di|vorc'd
from her Husband. They unanimou&s;ly a|gree
in believing that this is an infallible Mark
of Virginity: And this Opinion is &s;o generally
receiv'd thro' all <HI>A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> that if a Man
&s;hou'd endeavour to contradict it, he wou'd expo&s;e
him&s;elf to the Laughter and Deri&s;ion of all that
&s;hou'd hear him. The <HI>Italians</HI> are al&s;o per&s;uaded
of the Certainty of this Experiment, tho' they ab|&s;tain
from making a Shew of the Bloody Smock,
for fear of expo&s;ing their own Shame; but the
Husband examines his Bride very narrowly, and
if he finds her not &s;uch as he expects and de&s;ires,
'tis in vain for her to endeavour by the mo&s;t &s;o|lemn
Prote&s;tations to convince him of her Innocen|cy.
Neverthele&s;s this way of trying the Cha&s;tity
of a Maid is e&s;teem'd uncertain and ridiculous by
the <HI>French,</HI> and even by Chirurgeons; nor can I
reflect without a certain Wonder and A&s;toni&s;h|ment
on this Diver&s;ity of Opinions concerning a
Que&s;tion that one wou'd think might have been
fully decided by &s;o many repeated Experiments;
<PB N="286" REF="165">
for I &s;ee no rea&s;on to believe that our Country-Women
are fram'd after another manner than the
re&s;t of their Sex. But leaving this Controver&s;ie to
be decided by others who are better acquainted
with the Works of Nature, I &s;hall proceed in the
Account I promis'd to give you of the mo&s;t re|markable
<HI>Graecian</HI> Cu&s;toms, among which I cannot
forbear taking notice of one that &s;eems to be pecu|liar
to this Nation. On <HI>Ea&s;ter-Day,</HI> and during the
three following Weeks, they &s;alute one another
with three Ki&s;&s;es, one on the Mouth, and one on
each Cheek, at the &s;ame time repeating the&s;e Words,
<HI>Chri&s;tos ane&s;ti,</HI> that is, <HI>Chri&s;t is ri&s;en.</HI> At other times
their familiar Salutation is the &s;ame with that
which is us'd by the <HI>Turks:</HI> But when they de&s;ign
to &s;hew a more than ordinary Re&s;pect to a Man,
they ki&s;s his Hand, and then lay it upon their
Heads. They ob&s;erve the &s;ame Cu&s;tom when they
receive a Pre&s;ent, if it be not either too heavy
or bulky: For this Ceremony of laying a Man's
Hand upon their Head, is a Mark both of their
Re&s;pect and Gratitude. When a Woman accom|panies
her Husband in a Vi&s;it to a Per&s;on of Qua|lity,
&s;uch as a <HI>Con&s;ul,</HI> whether they come to treat of
Bus'ne&s;s, or only out of Civility, &s;he &s;tands direct|ly
behind her Husband; and when the Vi&s;iter
brings his Daughters along with him, they place
them&s;elves at one another's Back behind their Mo|ther;
&s;o that the Husband &s;tanding in the Front
of the File, hides all his Female Train; and when
they intend to go out, they make a half-Turn to
the Right, and the Daughters march out fir&s;t, to
avoid the Indecency of appearing in a Stranger's
Pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of the Method I propos'd to fol|low,
I &s;hall in the next place con&s;ider their Reli|gion.
I'm oblig'd to my Friend, the Archbi&s;hop,
for the following Account, which perhaps will
<PB N="287" REF="165">
give you a clearer <HI>Idea</HI> of this Subject than you can
draw from the Relations of others. For there are
&s;ome who pretend that the <HI>Greeks</HI> are only <HI>Schi&s;|maticks,</HI>
or bare Separati&s;ts from the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church;
whereas others &s;tretch the Point too far on the
other &s;ide, and make their Differences in matter of
Doctrine appear greater and more irreconcilable
than they really are.</P>
<P>They acknowledge only One vi&s;ible <HI>Church</HI> of
God, without which there is no Salvation, unle&s;s
in the Ca&s;e of a &s;udden Conver&s;ion at the Hour

<P>They believe that the Apo&s;tles in&s;tituted five <HI>Pa|triarchs</HI>
to govern the Church upon the Earth, who
were &s;eated at <HI>Rome, Alexandria, Con&s;tantinople, An|tioch,</HI>
and <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and under them &s;everal Arch|bi&s;hops,
Bi&s;hops, and inferiour Pa&s;tors. All the
Members of this Hierarchy have a Right to exer|ci&s;e
a Spiritual Juri&s;diction over tho&s;e that are &s;ub|ordinate
to 'em, and to inflict Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Cen|&s;ures.
But the Patriarchs can only admoni&s;h one
another, and can neither be puni&s;h'd nor depos'd
for their Offences but by the Sentence of a Gene|ral
Council. Yet their Power does not extend
&s;o far as to enable 'em to introduce new Laws
into the Church, and they wou'd be laught at if
they &s;hou'd attempt to grant Indulgencies. The
Bi&s;hop of <HI>Rome</HI> is the fir&s;t of the Patriarchs; nor
do any of the re&s;t pretend to di&s;pute with him for
Precedency: But they refu&s;e to &s;ubmit to that ab|&s;olute
Power he has a&s;&s;um'd in the <HI>We&s;t,</HI> by ta|king
Advantage of the Super&s;tition and Simplicity
of the People, and the Connivance of the Princes.
'Tis plain that the <HI>Greek</HI> Bi&s;hops had Rea&s;on to re|fu&s;e
their Con&s;ent to the Introduction and E&s;ta|bli&s;hment
of a Tyrannical Power in the Church,
&s;ince they cou'd not but fore&s;ee that it wou'd pro|duce
very fatal and pernicious Con&s;equences: And
<PB N="288" REF="166">
yet this is the only Cau&s;e that made the Pope
di&s;charge his Thunders again&s;t 'em, and declare
'em <HI>Schi&s;maticks;</HI> thus violently breaking the &s;acred
Union of the Church, for the Pre&s;ervation of
which he ought to have &s;pent the la&s;t Drop of
his Blood. For this rea&s;on the <HI>Greeks</HI> are not con|tented
with returning the Charge of <HI>Schi&s;m</HI> upon the
<HI>Roman</HI> Church, but pretend that they never actually
&s;eparated from the Communion of <HI>Rome,</HI> &s;ince
they have not e&s;tabli&s;h'd a <HI>Fifth Patriarch,</HI> and &s;till
acknowledge the <HI>Pope</HI> to be the <HI>fir&s;t Bi&s;hop</HI> in the
World, and that therefore they cannot with the
lea&s;t Shadow of Ju&s;tice be blam'd for the Fault of
another, or &s;aid to &s;eparate from a Church which
has violently driven 'em out of her Communion.
I know not whether this is the Opinion of the whole
<HI>Greek</HI> Church; tho' I cannot rea&s;onably decline giving
Credit to a Thing which I have heard &s;o often con|firm'd
with repeated Prote&s;tations by the Archbi&s;hop
of <HI>Smyrna,</HI> who is e&s;teem'd one of the mo&s;t learned
Doctors of that Church in this Age. However,
I took the Liberty to ask him why they did
not &s;end their Bi&s;hops to the la&s;t Councils that
were held in the <HI>We&s;t,</HI> in which all their Differen|ces
might have been amicably terminated. He
reply'd, that their Ab&s;ence wou'd be ea&s;ily excus'd
by tho&s;e who con&s;ider the Severity of the Yoak
under which they groan; and that the &s;ending of
Deputies to the Councils wou'd have given a ter|rible
Umbrage to the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> who wou'd
have been apt to &s;u&s;pect that the&s;e Bi&s;hops were
&s;ent to contrive a Rebellion again&s;t him, and to
plot the Ruine of his Empire; and to deliver him|&s;elf
from the danger of a Revolt, might have been
ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to have put the whole Nation un|der
Military Execution. This An&s;wer &s;eem'd &s;o
rea&s;onable, and agreeable to the Truth, that I
was oblig'd to acknowledge my &s;elf intirely &s;atis|fy'd.
<PB N="289" REF="166">
Thus I have given a &s;hort Account of
the Occa&s;ion of the fatal Breach that divides the
<HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> and <HI>We&s;tern</HI> Churches, and of the Rea&s;ons
alledg'd by the <HI>Greeks</HI> to free them&s;elves of the
Imputation of <HI>Schi&s;m.</HI> I &s;hall in the next Place
examine the Points of Doctrine in which they dif|fer
from the <HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P>The Difference between the&s;e Churches may be
reduc'd to five Articles, of which only two are
Fundamentals: For tho' the other three are of con|&s;iderable
Moment, they wou'd not be &s;ufficient to
excu&s;e a Separation. The fir&s;t is the <HI>Proce&s;&s;ion of
the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> who in their Opinion proceeds not
from the <HI>Son,</HI> but only from the <HI>Father.</HI> To illu&s;trate
and confirm this Doctrine, the Archbi&s;hop told me,
that the <HI>Three Per&s;ons</HI> of the <HI>Trinity</HI> were only di|&s;tingui&s;h'd
by their different Operations and Attri|butes;
That the Property of the <HI>Father</HI> was to be|get
without being begotten; That of the <HI>Son,</HI> to
be eternally begotten, without begetting; and
that of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> to in&s;pire and &s;anctifie our
Hearts. I reply'd, That it did not nece&s;&s;arily fol|low,
becau&s;e the <HI>Son</HI> was begotten, that he cou'd
not co-operate with the <HI>Father</HI> in the <HI>Proce&s;&s;ion of
the Holy Gho&s;t:</HI> But he wou'd not acknowledge
the force of this Rea&s;on, pretending that we cou'd
not a&s;cribe to the <HI>Son</HI> the Attribute of <HI>Generation,</HI>
that belongs only to the <HI>Father,</HI> without overturn|ing
the Order, and confounding the Per&s;ons of
the <HI>Trinity.</HI> Then he repeated what he had &s;aid
before, that the Per&s;ons were only di&s;tingui&s;h'd by
their Attributes; f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">om whence he concluded that
the latter cou'd not be confounded without con|founding
the former. And for a farther Confir|mation
of his Opinion, he &s;hew'd me a large Vo|lume
of S. <HI>Athana&s;ius,</HI> printed at <HI>Venice,</HI> with the
<HI>Latin</HI> on one &s;ide, and the <HI>Greek</HI> on the other, and
made me take Notice of two Pa&s;&s;ages, which I
<PB N="290" REF="167">
tran&s;crib'd, but have unhappily lo&s;t the Paper.
However, tho' I cannot at pre&s;ent call to Mind
the very Words of the Author. I remember that
in the fir&s;t Pa&s;&s;age he &s;poke of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t's</HI>
proceeding from the <HI>Father,</HI> without mentioning
the Son. I reply'd, that the Que&s;tion was not
whether the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> proceeded from the Father;
and that the Author whom he cited did not deny
his Proce&s;&s;ion from the <HI>Son.</HI> But I was oblig'd to
acknowledge that the &s;ame An&s;wer wou'd not
&s;erve to elude the po&s;itive Authority of another
Pa&s;&s;age which he &s;hew'd me in the <HI>Nicene Creed,</HI>
where 'tis expre&s;sly &s;aid, <HI>&agrave; &s;olo Patre procedens.</HI> Thus
my Mouth was &s;topt on this Subject, as well as
on the former; and I mu&s;t leave the Deci&s;ion
of this Controver&s;ie to tho&s;e who&s;e Profe&s;&s;ion
obliges 'em to &s;earch into the&s;e My&s;teries.</P>
<P>The &s;econd difference between the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI>
Churches, is concerning the Doctrine of <HI>Purgatory,</HI>
which the latter expre&s;sly denies, affirming, with us,
that 'tis ab&s;olutely injurious to the Merit and Satisfa|ction
of Chri&s;t: Yet they pretend there is a certain
Bapti&s;mal Fire, through which every one mu&s;t
pa&s;s before he can be admitted into <HI>Paradi&s;e.</HI>
They believe that the Souls of Ju&s;t Per&s;ons at
their Separation from the Body, go into a Third
Place, of the &s;ame Nature with the <HI>Romi&s;h Lim|bo's,</HI>
where they mu&s;t remain till the Day of Judg|ment,
at which Time a &s;udden Fire &s;hall di&s;&s;olve
the World in an In&s;tant, and purifie the Souls of
the Righteous, who after their final Judgment,
&s;hall be receiv'd into everla&s;ting Glory. To con|firm
this Doctrine, they alledge that Pa&s;&s;age of the
Scripture which &s;peaks of the Souls that <HI>re&s;t under
the Altar:</HI> But after all, this Opinion &s;eems not
to be &s;o well grounded as the former; for if the
Dead are not in a &s;uffering Condition, I know
<PB N="291" REF="167">
not what Rea&s;on they can give to ju&s;tifie their
praying for 'em.</P>
<P>The third Point is the <HI>Communion under both kinds:</HI>
for they give the Sacrament to the People in a
Spoon, in which the Bread and Wine are mixt to|gether.</P>
<P>The Fourth is concerning <HI>Leaven'd Bread,</HI>
which they u&s;e in the Con&s;ecration of the Sacra|ment.</P>
<P>The Fifth and la&s;t Point in which they differ
from tho&s;e of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Per&s;ua&s;ion is the <HI>Celibacy
of the Clergy:</HI> For a &s;imple Prie&s;t is allow'd to mar|ry
once, but mu&s;t never proceed to a &s;econd Mar|riage.
The Prie&s;ts wear the Violet-colour'd Habit
of a Bi&s;hop, and a Cap of the &s;ame Colour, with
a little blue <HI>Turbant;</HI> and behind their Cap there
hangs a piece of Cloth of the &s;ame Colour a|bout
half a Foot long and broad, which falls back
on their Shoulders. Be&s;ides the&s;e Prie&s;ts, there
are certain Religious Per&s;ons under a Vow of
Cha&s;tity; and out of their Number the Bi&s;hops,
and even the Pa&s;tors, are cho&s;en, whom they call
<HI>Papa's:</HI> They eat no Fle&s;h, and wear long Hair,
without ever touching it with Sci&s;&s;ors: They al|&s;o
&s;uffer their Beards to grow without &s;having or
clipping 'em, which disfigures their Faces, and
makes 'em &s;eem very ugly. They wear a large
black Gown or Robe, not much different from
our Night-Gowns; only their Sleeves are wider,
and button'd before; and the Neck is like that of
a Ca&s;&s;ock. Their Caps are made of Felt, flat
beneath like the Block of a Hat, and wou'd be
very deep, if they were not cut before; &s;o that
the whole Face appears, but the Ears and hinder|part
of the Head are cover'd. Over this they
wear a Kerchief of black Serge, which hangs o|ver
their Shoulders. This Habit is generally us'd
by all religious Per&s;ons, Pa&s;tors, Bi&s;hops, and Arch|bi&s;hops,
<PB N="292" REF="168">
without any Mark of Di&s;tinction; only
the Bi&s;hops carry in their Hands a Pa&s;toral Staff
of Ebony, eight Foot long, with an Ivory Ball
on the Top. The Bi&s;hops are not u&s;ually rich, but
they are no le&s;s re&s;pected by their Clergy than
our <HI>French</HI> Prelates are by theirs. Their Churches
are built after the manner of ours, but without
the lea&s;t appearance of Pomp or Grandeur. They
have a Quire where the Prie&s;ts place them&s;elves,
with tho&s;e that come to confe&s;s; and a Place for
the Church-Wardens, with a Crucifix, or a Saint,
to which every one pre&s;ents an Offering. The
Bi&s;hops do not ob&s;erve &s;o much State as in <HI>France;</HI>
for my Curio&s;ity having one Day carry'd me to
&s;ee 'em Officiate, the Archbi&s;hop ro&s;e up to &s;a|lute
me, and made me &s;it down by him on one
of the Seats in the Quire, whither a Prie&s;t con|ducted
me by his Order; after which they brought
me &s;ome Frankincen&s;e, as they do to all Per&s;ons
of Note of their own Nation. Their Pontifical
Habit is &s;o &s;ingular and odly contriv'd, that
'twou'd be a hard Task to repre&s;ent it di&s;tinctly;
and therefore I will neither undertake the De|&s;cription
of that, nor of their Ceremonies and
Rites of Wor&s;hip. I &s;hall only add, that when
they enter the Church, they take &s;ome Holy-Water,
and make five large Signs of the Cro&s;s,
at each of which they make a very low Bow, repeat|ing
the &s;ame Ceremony when they go out, to
commemorate the five Wounds of our Savi|our.</P>
<P>It has been &s;o po&s;itively a&s;&s;erted by &s;o many
celebrated Divines, that the Doctrine of <HI>Tran&s;ub|&s;tantiation</HI>
is not acknowledg'd by the <HI>Greek</HI> Church,
that I dare hardly venture to contradict 'em. How|ever,
&s;ince neither Intere&s;t not Authority ought to
deterr us from owning the Truth, I'm re&s;olv'd at
all Adventures to undeceive you of &s;o vulgar an
<PB N="293" REF="168">
Error. 'Tis plain that the Authors of tho&s;e Relations,
on who&s;e Credit that Opinion is grounded, were
either deceiv'd them&s;elves, or intended to deceive
their Readers; unle&s;s perhaps to &s;often the har&s;hne&s;s
of that Cen&s;ure you had rather believe that they
&s;peak of &s;ome ob&s;cure Sect, which is not known in
thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> Countrey: For I can a&s;&s;ure you that the <HI>Greeks</HI>
at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> and <HI>Smyrna</HI> are as firmly per&s;waded
of the truth of that Doctrine as the mo&s;t zealous
<HI>Romani&s;ts;</HI> and the only rea&s;on why they do not
kneel at the Elevation of the Ho&s;t, is becau&s;e
their manner of Adoration is different from ours.
Nor do they wor&s;hip the Sacrament le&s;s devoutly
by bowing their Body, and &s;miting their Brea&s;t,
tho' they &s;tand all the while on their Feet, than
we do by pro&s;trating our &s;elves on the Ground;
and therefore we ought rather to con&s;ider the In|tention
of their Mind than the Po&s;ture of their
Body. But this is not all; for they have a Cu|&s;tom
which may &s;erve for a convincing Proof of
their Belief of that Opinion. On <HI>Good-Friday</HI> they
walk in Proce&s;&s;ion to the <HI>French</HI> Church, to adore
the Sacrament which is expos'd there, and even
pay five hundred <HI>Pia&s;ters</HI> to the <HI>Turks</HI> that they
may be &s;uffer'd to perform their Devotions there
on that Occa&s;ion: So true it is that they are not
willing to be &s;eparated from the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI>
You may depend upon the Certainty of this Sto|ry;
for I can a&s;&s;ure you of the Truth of it on
the Faith of an Eye-Witne&s;s.</P>
<P>They have a great Number of <HI>Images;</HI> and
their Devotion to 'em is not at all inferior to that
which prevails in the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> But I mu&s;t
confe&s;s there is a great Difference in the Structure
and Workman&s;hip of the Images; for whereas in
our Country they may, for the mo&s;t part, be reckon'd
&s;o many Ma&s;ter-pieces of Art, whether we con&s;i|der
the Regularity of the De&s;ign, the Di&s;po&s;ition
<PB N="294" REF="169">
of the Lights and Shades, or the Beauty of the
Colours. The <HI>Greeks</HI> are of Opinion, and &s;cruple
not to &s;ay, that the Pictures of the Saints, as
they are repre&s;ented in the <HI>Roman</HI> Churches are
more proper to rai&s;e Criminal De&s;ires, than to
in&s;pire the Minds of the Spectators with Devoti|on.
And therefore to avoid the dangerous Con|&s;equences
of that Abu&s;e, they confine them&s;elves
to a certain Antick way of Painting, which is
extremely unnatural, e&s;pecially in their Figures of
Virgins, who are almo&s;t all repre&s;ented black, and
&s;o muffled up in Kerchiefs and Gowns, that you
can &s;carce di&s;tingui&s;h their Faces. And their
Painters are &s;o ignorant, and &s;o little acquainted
with the Beauties of the Art they profe&s;s, that
they cannot &s;o much as copy a Head. Nor am
I at all &s;urpriz'd at the Unskillfulne&s;s of the&s;e
pretended Arti&s;ts; for their Method is directly op|po&s;ite
to that of our Painters: Fir&s;t they lay on the
Shades, and de&s;ign the entire Figure, after which
they proceed to the Di&s;po&s;ition of the Light; which
is the mo&s;t prepo&s;terous Method cou'd be imagin'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Armenians</HI> are not &s;o &s;crupulous in this
Point, tho' they profe&s;s almo&s;t the &s;ame Articles
of Faith; for they make u&s;e of the modern way
of Painting; and there is at pre&s;ent on their
High Altar an Image of the <HI>Virgin,</HI> made by a
<HI>French-man,</HI> which &s;hews &s;o much of her Brea&s;ts
that I &s;hou'd be almo&s;t Jealous if my Mi&s;tre&s;s
were painted after that Manner. Neverthele&s;s you
mu&s;t not &s;u&s;pect them of <HI>Libertini&s;m;</HI> for I never heard
of any Religious Order, except the Monks of <HI>Trape,</HI>
that ob&s;erve &s;uch mortifying <HI>Fa&s;ts.</HI> They keep
four <HI>Lents,</HI> which la&s;ts one half of the Year, like
tho&s;e that are ob&s;erv'd by the <HI>Greeks:.</HI> But the <HI>Armen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ns</HI>
do not allow them&s;elves &s;o much Liberty as the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> of their Fellow <HI>Chri&s;tians;</HI> for they ab&s;tain
from eating Fle&s;h, Fi&s;h, and even Shell-Fi&s;h, Butter,
<PB N="295" REF="169">
Milk, Chee&s;e, and every thing that has or ever
had Life; which may be ju&s;tly reckon'd a very &s;evere
piece of Mortification. Their Bi&s;hop has put him|&s;elf
under the Protection of <HI>France,</HI> to deliver
him&s;elf from the in&s;upportable Exactions of the
<HI>Turks;</HI> and 'tis but a very little while ago &s;ince
he was freed from Pri&s;on, where he had lain &s;ix
Months. He is a very hone&s;t and civil Per&s;on,
and diligent in performing the Duties of his Fun|ction.
His Habit is almo&s;t the &s;ame with that of
the <HI>Greek</HI> Bi&s;hop, only he wears a Hood or Cawle
at the Neck of his Gown, and carries in his Hand
a Cro&s;s, like that which is us'd by the <HI>Roman</HI> Bi|&s;hops,
only 'tis made of Wood. This puts me in
Mind of what a certain Author &s;aid concerning
the Ancients, That they were <HI>Golden Bi&s;hops</HI> tho'
they wore <HI>Wooden Cro&s;&s;es;</HI> and I may &s;afely ven|ture
to apply that Saying to this Prelate.</P>
<P>To return to the <HI>Greeks;</HI> I had almo&s;t forgot
to take Notice of one of their Opinions in which
they differ from tho&s;e of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Per&s;ua&s;ion.
You have doubtle&s;s ob&s;erv'd that the <HI>Romani&s;ts</HI> have
an extreme Veneration for tho&s;e Per&s;ons who&s;e
Bodies remain free from <HI>Putrefaction</HI> after their
Death; and that the Incorruption of the Body is
reckon'd a convincing Mark of the Holine&s;s of
the Deceas'd, and is one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable
Proofs that can be offer'd for the <HI>Canonization</HI> of
the Saint; whereas the <HI>Greeks</HI> pretend that 'tis
only an Effect of <HI>Excommunication;</HI> and when they
find a Body in that Condition, they never leave
praying for the Soul of the dead Per&s;on, till his
Body be putrefy'd and corrupted.</P>
<P>The <HI>Interrment</HI> of dead Bodies is perform'd with
almo&s;t the &s;ame Ceremonies that are ob&s;erv'd in
the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> All the Clergy meet toge|ther,
and &s;ing the <HI>de profundis,</HI> and Prayers for the
Soul of the Deceas'd. Several Per&s;ons march be|fore
<PB N="296" REF="170">
with lighted Candles, after whom the Body is
carry'd in an open Coffin, dre&s;t in its fine&s;t Clothes,
with a little Cotton in its Mouth; &s;o that often|times
the Per&s;on &s;eems to be alive. Then comes
the Husband or Wife, accompany'd with the
Children and Slaves of the Deceas'd, all bellowing
out their Grief in &s;o di&s;mal and terrible a Man|ner,
that one wou'd conclude they thought them|&s;elves
irrecoverably ruin'd. The Women e&s;pecial|ly
&s;ignalize their Love by all the wilde&s;t Marks
of De&s;pair, to&s;&s;ing their Bodies &s;o furiou&s;ly from
&s;ide to &s;ide, that they wou'd certainly break
their Necks if they were not &s;upported by two
Per&s;ons who are appointed to attend 'em. Their
u&s;ual Song is <HI>Hai agamimont, hai mathiamont; Ab
my Eyes! ah my Love!</HI> And the Slaves echo back
the howling Mu&s;ick with &s;o hideous a Noi&s;e, that
one wou'd think they de&s;ign'd to &s;care the De|vil.
Tho&s;e who have not a &s;ufficient Number of
Slaves to make a Noi&s;e &s;utable to the Quality of
the Deceas'd, may &s;upply that Defect by hiring
<HI>Weeping-Women,</HI> who for an <HI>J&s;allote,</HI> which is worth
about forty Pence, howl and cry, as if they were
acted by the mo&s;t furious Tran&s;ports of Rage and
De&s;pair. 'Tis true, the Frace is too gro&s;s and vi|&s;ible;
for there is &s;omething &s;o moving in true Sor|row
that it can never be counterfeited; neither
is it po&s;&s;ible for the mo&s;t dextrous Mimick to
imitate the tender Motions of Nature. And even
when tho&s;e pretended Mourners &s;eem to be tran|&s;ported
with Fury and De&s;pair, running about
like Mad-Women, with di&s;hevell'd Hair, the Ar|tifice
is ea&s;ily di&s;cernible. And particularly I ob|&s;erv'd,
that when they pretend to tear their Hair,
they hold it fa&s;t with one Hand near the Roots,
and then pull as hard as they can with the o|ther.
To co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">clude, an unconcern'd Spectator
wou'd be tempted to imagine that all this Mumme|ry
<PB N="297" REF="170">
is acted in deri&s;ion to the deceas'd; for as &s;oon as
he is interr'd, they make a Fea&s;t on his Grave at his
own Charge; and his Wife and Children take care
that nothing be wanting to the Company, who eat
and drink and laugh, as if they were carou&s;ing in a
Tipling Hou&s;e. This is certainly a very extravagant
way of expre&s;&s;ing their Affection to their dead
Friends; nor cou'd they treat a Man wor&s;e who&s;e
Memory they de&s;ign'd to affront. I have al&s;o
had occa&s;ion to &s;ee the Funeral Solemnities of the
<HI>Jews,</HI> which in my Opinion are le&s;s incon&s;i&s;tent
with the Rules of Decency; for tho' they u&s;e
tho&s;e Affected Howlings as well as the <HI>Greeks,</HI> their
De&s;ign is to Mourn and not to Fea&s;t. Among the
Ceremonies that are us'd by the <HI>Iews</HI> at the Death
of their Relations, I took notice of one which
&s;eems to be very Trouble&s;ome and Inconvenient,
I mean their keeping of the Dead Body Three
Days unbury'd: And I leave you to judge what
a &s;ad Companion that mu&s;t be to the Widow and
Children, who are oblig'd to weep without Inter|mi&s;&s;ion
till the Body be interr'd.</P>
<P>Since the De&s;cription of the <HI>Greeki&s;h</HI> Funerals
has given me an Occa&s;ion to mention the <HI>Jews,</HI>
I &s;hall conclude this Letter with a brief Account
of that Nation. 'Twou'd be needle&s;s to enter|tain
you with an Abridgement of their Ancient
Hi&s;tory, and therefore I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that
after the <HI>Romans</HI> became Ma&s;ters of <HI>Pale&s;tine,</HI> the&s;e
unhappy Fugitives were di&s;pers'd, and &s;catter'd
thro' the whole World, and have liv'd ever &s;ince
like hated Vagabonds, without King or Head, ex|pecting
the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> with an Impatience that has
frequently made 'em give Credit to Impo&s;tors.
About Thirty Years ago there aro&s;e a fal&s;e Pro|phet
or <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> in this Country, call'd <HI>Sabatai Sevi,</HI>
who was very learned, and had diligently &s;tudy'd
the <HI>Cabala,</HI> by which means, 'twas thought, he came
<PB N="298" REF="171">
to the Knowledge of certain Magical Secrets, which
he afterwards made U&s;e of to abu&s;e the Credulity
of his Followers. I have heard a Thou&s;and Stories
of him, but &s;hall content my &s;elf with telling you
that he manag'd the Cheat with &s;o much De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">|terity
and Succe&s;s, that he was follow'd by a great
Multitude of People, and began to exerci&s;e &s;o
great an Authority over the <HI>Jews,</HI> that the <HI>Grand
Signior</HI> him&s;elf, growing jealous of his Power and
Credit, order'd him to be apprehended, and
brought in Chains to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> where this pre|tended
<HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> turn'd <HI>Turk</HI> to &s;ave his Life. The
Scandal of this Example, which ought to have
taught the <HI>Jews</HI> more Caution for the future,
cou'd not keep 'em from falling not long after
into another Error of the &s;ame Nature. You mu&s;t
know that during the <HI>Fea&s;t of Tabernacles,</HI> the
young Women of that Nation are oblig'd to lie
abroad under Tents in a place appointed for that
purpo&s;e; and they have an old Tradition that the
<HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> &s;hall be conceiv'd in the Womb of a Vir|gin
during that Fe&s;tival. Now it happen'd that a
certain Maid, who it &s;eems was weary of that
Denomination, re&s;olv'd to make u&s;e of &s;o favour|able
an Opportunity of ta&s;ting the <HI>forbidden Delight,</HI>
and to conceal her Fault, &s;pread abroad a Report
that God came to vi&s;it her every Night, and that
&s;he was to be the Mother of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah.</HI> The&s;e
acceptable News were receiv'd with Joy by the
whole Synagogue, who appointed &s;everal Days
of Solemn Thank&s;giving to be kept with all ima|ginable
Secre&s;ie, for fear of offending the <HI>Turks.</HI>
But their Joy was at la&s;t turn'd into Shame and
Confu&s;ion, when in&s;tead of their expected <HI>Deli|verer,</HI>
the pretended Virgin was brought to B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d
of a <HI>Daughter.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="171">
The <HI>Levantine Jews</HI> are extremely Cunning and
Deceitful, and &s;o dextrous in the Art of Wheed|ling,
that tho&s;e who deal with 'em ought to be
always upon their Guard. Cheating is the Trade
by which they live, as others do by Labour or
Traffick; and 'tis u&s;ually &s;aid here, that a <HI>Jew</HI>
never eats his Breakfa&s;t till he has cheated a <HI>Chri|&s;tian.</HI>
However, 'tis certain that he who tru&s;ts
'em mu&s;t either betray his Ignorance or Impru|dence;
for by a mode&s;t Computation, I may
venture to a&s;&s;ure you, that among <HI>Twenty Jews</HI>
there are always <HI>Nineteen Knaves.</HI> There cannot
be a more convincing Argument to prove that <HI>Re|ligion</HI>
is not always attended with <HI>Hone&s;ty;</HI> for if
it were, the <HI>Jews</HI> wou'd be the hone&s;te&s;t Men in
the World. They ob&s;erve the Precepts of their
Law with an incredible exactne&s;s; and wou'd not
do the lea&s;t Work on the <HI>Sabbath</HI> to prevent the
Ruine of the Univer&s;e. 'Tis not yet a Fortnight
&s;ince we had an eminent In&s;tance of the Power
of Super&s;tition, on occa&s;ion of a Fire which broke
forth in the <HI>Jews</HI> Quarter in this City on the <HI>Sab|bath</HI>
Day; for they &s;uffer'd it to con&s;ume their
Hou&s;es without endeavouring to quench it; and
one among the re&s;t &s;eeing his Child ju&s;t ready to
be devour'd by the Flames, contented him&s;elf
with tearing his Hair, in&s;tead of breaking the Win|dow
of his Hou&s;e, tho' there was no other Way
to &s;ave the Life of his mi&s;erable Infant, which
wou'd have been certainly burnt alive, if it had
not been &s;ea&s;onably re&s;cu'd by &s;ome <HI>Greeks,</HI> who&s;e
Compa&s;&s;ion drew 'em to its A&s;&s;i&s;tance. This Fire
made a prodigious Havock, for it de&s;troy'd above a
Hundred Hou&s;es, in the greate&s;t part of which
there were Warehou&s;es.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jews</HI> are no le&s;s jealous of their Wives than
the <HI>Turks,</HI> and are very careful in keeping 'em
under a clo&s;e Confinement. 'Tis true, they are
<PB N="300" REF="172">
permitted to &s;ee and vi&s;it one another; but if a
Woman &s;hou'd walk a Quarter of a League out
of the City without her Husband or Brother, &s;he
wou'd infallibly be divorc'd.</P>
<P>They wear a large Gown of black Cloth, made
almo&s;t like that of the <HI>Papa's;</HI> and their Shooes
are of a Violet Colour. Their Caps are of Felt,
cover'd with Violet-colour'd Cloth, and re&s;emble a
long Block of a Hat. Round their Caps they tye
a &s;mall &s;trip'd or Violet-colour'd <HI>Turbant,</HI> which
they call a <HI>Tandour.</HI> They are oblig'd to pay the
<HI>Carache</HI> as well as the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and are treated with
more &s;corn and Contempt: But they are naturally
of &s;o intrigueing a Temper, that they thru&s;t them|&s;elves
into all &s;orts to Bus'ne&s;s, and are at pre|&s;ent
the only Managers of Trade; for there are
no other Brokers in the <HI>Levant.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>JU&s;t now I'm inform'd that five <HI>Barbary</HI> Ve&s;&s;els
anchor'd this Morning at <HI>Fo&s;che,</HI> which is a lit|tle
Harbour at the Mouth of the Gulph. If this
be true, we mu&s;t expect to &s;ee the Streets always
full of tho&s;e in&s;olent Scoundrels, from whom the
<HI>Franks</HI> receive a Vi&s;it once every Year, tho' they
wou'd gladly di&s;pence with &s;o trouble&s;ome a piece
of Civility. I have not yet had Experience of
their Deportment; but the Accounts I have re|ceiv'd
from others have extremely abated my na|tural
Curio&s;ity to be acquainted with the Cu&s;toms
of Strangers: And I had much rather hear a De|&s;cription
than be an Eye-Witne&s;s of the Di&s;orders
they committed in this City, which are &s;till &s;o
fre&s;h in the Memory of the People, that they
hardly talk of any thing el&s;e. I know not whe|ther
you cou'd hear without Di&s;turbance a Rela|lation
of tho&s;e Abu&s;es, if you were in a place
where you might &s;hortly expect to &s;ee 'em re|peated:
But &s;ince you are at &s;o great a Di&s;tance
from the Scene of the Tragedy, you may ven|ture
to read it without fearing to be made a Spe|ctator
of it: And be&s;ides, there can be nothing
more proper to give you a clear <HI>Idea</HI> of the Weak|ne&s;s
of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Government.</P>
<P>About a Year ago the &s;ame <HI>Barbary</HI> Ships touch'd
at the Port where they have now ca&s;t Anchor, which
is only four or five Leagues di&s;tant from this place;
and &s;ince the&s;e Sea-Mon&s;ters are not re&s;train'd by
the lea&s;t &s;hadow of Di&s;cipline, one half of 'em
was perpetually in the City. The&s;e pretended
<PB N="302" REF="173">
Soldiers are a meer Rabble of Murderers, Rob|bers,
and the mo&s;t de&s;perate Villains, who, to a|void
the ju&s;t Puni&s;hment of their Crimes, flock
from all parts of <HI>Africk</HI> to the Sea-Coa&s;t, where
they find on board the Ships, a Sanctuary that
&s;ecures 'em from being made accountable for their
pa&s;t Offences, and are at the &s;ame time privileg'd
to re-act their former Barbarities without con|troul;
&s;o that they are equally dreaded by the
<HI>Turks, Greeks,</HI> and <HI>Franks,</HI> tho' the Storm falls hea|vie&s;t
upon the la&s;t, e&s;pecially &s;ince the Bombard|ing
of <HI>Algiers,</HI> which has in&s;pir'd 'em with a hor|rible
Aver&s;ion again&s;t the <HI>French,</HI> and again&s;t all o|ther
<HI>Franks</HI> for their &s;ake.</P>
<P>Two or three Days after their Landing, two of
'em drinking in a Tipling-Hou&s;e pick'd a Quarrel
with a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> who &s;eeing 'em advance towards
him with naked Poniards, di&s;charg'd his Pi&s;tol
at 'em, and then made his E&s;cape. Imme|diately
the two <HI>Barbarianss</HI> one of whom had re|ceiv'd
a &s;light Wound by the Shot, being reinforc'd
by &s;ome of their Fellows, ran thro' the Streets,
&s;wearing like enrag'd Furies, and threatning to
murder all the <HI>French</HI> without exception. In the
Heat of their Rage they met three Mariners of
<HI>Provence</HI> coming out of a Barber's Shop, whom
they in&s;tantly a&s;&s;aulted, and dragg'd by the Hair
along the Street to the <HI>Bazar,</HI> where they butcher'd
'em with their Poniards in a mo&s;t barbarous man|ner.
The <HI>French Con&s;ul</HI> being alarm'd at the News,
commanded tho&s;e of his Nation to keep within
Doors all that Day, and &s;ent for Soldiers and
Arms from on board the Ships that were in the
Port, to &s;ecure him from the In&s;olency of the in|cens'd
Rabble. Next Morning he order'd forty
Men, arm'd with Carabines and Pi&s;tols, to bring
off the Bodies of the three Seamen that had lain
all the while in the Street. As &s;oon as the <HI>Bar|baria<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI>
<PB N="303" REF="173">
heard of their De&s;ign, they re&s;olv'd to op|po&s;e
the Execution of it; but &s;ince they had no
Fire-Arms, and are extremely afraid of Shot, they
fled after the fir&s;t Di&s;charge, and left the Bodies
to the <HI>French,</HI> who carry'd 'em off without any
Oppo&s;ition. In the mean time the <HI>Con&s;ul</HI> had
&s;ent a Me&s;&s;age to the other two <HI>Con&s;uls</HI> of <HI>En|gland</HI>
and <HI>Holland,</HI> to beg their A&s;&s;i&s;tance in the
Common Cau&s;e of the Three Nations: But the&s;e
Gentlemen did not think fit to irritate an enrag'd
Mobb that had not po&s;itively declar'd again&s;t a|ny
other Nation but the <HI>French.</HI> And it appear'd
by the Event, that they acted wi&s;ely in &s;o nice
a Juncture; for the Neutrality they ob&s;erv'd, and
the Care they took not to kindle the Fury of the
<HI>Barbarians</HI> by appearing too much in the Streets,
had &s;o good an Effect, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI>
receiv'd not the lea&s;t Injury during the Tumult,
except &s;ome affronting Words. The <HI>French Con&s;ul</HI>
being di&s;appointed of the A&s;&s;i&s;tance he expected
from the two Nations, and not knowing to what
Saint he &s;hou'd make h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s next Addre&s;s, re&s;olv'd at
la&s;t to demand Protection from the <HI>Cadi.</HI> Imme|diately
he &s;ent two Merchants, and as many In|terpreters
to complain to that Officer of the In|juries
he had receiv'd from the <HI>Barbarians,</HI> and to
a&s;&s;ure him that if the Tumult were not quickly
appeas'd, he wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d &s;eek Redre&s;s at the <HI>Port,</HI> and
in the mean time wou'd Arm tho&s;e of his Nati|on
in their own Defence. But in&s;tead of the Aid
he expected, he had the Mortification to re|ceive
only a faint Excu&s;e; for the mo&s;t favourable
An&s;wer his Me&s;&s;engers cou'd obtain from the <HI>Ca|di</HI>
was, that he had not Forces &s;ufficient to &s;up|pre&s;s
the &s;editious Multitude; and that the be&s;t
Advice he cou'd give his Ma&s;ter, was to defend
him&s;elf as well as he cou'd. The <HI>Con&s;ul</HI> percei|ving
that this was in effect an ab&s;olute Denial,
<PB N="304" REF="174">
di&s;patch'd an Expre&s;s to Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Cha&s;teauneuf,</HI>
to acquaint him with the extreme Danger that
threaten'd the Nation, and to intreat him to u&s;e
his Int're&s;t at the <HI>Port</HI> for the procuring a <HI>Grand
Mandamus</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Barbarians.</HI></P>
<P>Before I proceed farther, 'twill not be impro|per
to inform you, that a <HI>Grand Mandamus</HI> is an
expre&s;s Order from the <HI>Sultan,</HI> which he never
grants but in Ca&s;es of great Nece&s;&s;ity, and of
the highe&s;t Importance. Tho&s;e who refu&s;e to &s;ub|mit
to it are declar'd Rebels again&s;t the <HI>Grand
Signior;</HI> and the Law ordains that &s;uch Per|&s;ons
&s;hall be treated as Infidels: So that the&s;e
Orders may be call'd the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s Thunders;
as Excommunications are &s;aid to be the Thunders
of the <HI>Vatican.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Con&s;ul</HI> waited with an extreme Impatience
for the Return of his Expre&s;s, and during the
&s;pace of three Weeks which that Me&s;&s;enger &s;pent
in his Journey, and in di&s;patching his Bus'ne&s;s,
the <HI>French</HI> were forc'd to &s;uffer the In&s;olency of
the <HI>Barbarians,</HI> who&s;e Fury was &s;o far from being
appeas'd, that it wanted little of its fir&s;t impetu|o&s;ity;
for they continu'd &s;till to beat and affront
all the <HI>Frenchmen</HI> that came in their Way. Nor
cou'd the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Jews</HI> e&s;cape their Rage, for
as many of 'em as were found with yellow <HI>Ba|bouches,</HI>
long Breeches, or any &s;ort of Habit or
Ornament prohibited by Law, were &s;ure of the
<HI>Ba&s;tinado;</HI> the&s;e Villains pretending that they wou'd
re&s;tore Ju&s;tice in the City, and reform the Abu|&s;es
that had crept into the Government. One
Day they happen'd to meet an old <HI>Drogue-man</HI>
with a <HI>Chac&s;ir,</HI> after the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Fa&s;hion, and im|mediately
ask'd him by what Authority he wore
that Habit: The poor Man reply'd, that he wore
it as Interpreter of <HI>France;</HI> but this An&s;wer
in&s;tead of pacifying 'em, irritated 'em &s;o extremely,
<PB N="305" REF="174">
that after a &s;evere Beating they took away his
<HI>Chac&s;ir,</HI> and &s;ent him home with a bare Breech.
At la&s;t the <HI>Grand Mandamus</HI> came, forbidding the
<HI>Barbarians</HI> under pain of Rebellion to mole&s;t the
<HI>French;</HI> and ordaining the <HI>Cadi,</HI> and all the Inha|bitants
of <HI>Smyrna,</HI> to &s;hut up their Shops, and be
ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t the <HI>French</HI> in ca&s;e of any Tumult
or Di&s;turbance. The <HI>Con&s;ul</HI> was extremely proud
of this Order, and after he had notify'd it to the
<HI>Cadi,</HI> thought him&s;elf as &s;ecure as if he had ob|tain'd
a &s;trong Reinforcement: But the <HI>Barbarians,</HI>
who had receiv'd Advice of it from the <HI>Cadi,</HI> in|&s;tead
of &s;ubmitting to the <HI>Sultan</HI>'s Command, be|gan
to Rage with more Violence than before.
The fir&s;t who felt the Fury of this new Storm,
were a Chirurgeon and another <HI>Frenchman,</HI> who
receiv'd three Wounds with a Poniard. After|wards
they be&s;ieg'd the <HI>Con&s;ul</HI>'s Hou&s;e, and wou'd
have &s;et Fire to it, if they had not been prevent|ed
by fifteen or twenty <HI>Jani&s;aries,</HI> whom he had
call'd to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance. The <HI>Cadi</HI> &s;eem'd to be an
unconcern'd Spectator of all the&s;e Di&s;orders; for
when the <HI>Con&s;ul</HI> &s;ent to require his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, ac|cording
to the Order he had receiv'd from the <HI>Port,</HI>
he an&s;wer'd him in plain Terms, that he neither
wou'd nor dur&s;t incen&s;e the <HI>Barbarians,</HI> and that
he was re&s;olv'd to expect the Event without in|terpo&s;ing
in other Mens Affairs. In the mean time
the Inhabitants of the City &s;hut up their Shops,
according to the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s Order; but they
were &s;o far from a&s;&s;i&s;ting the <HI>French,</HI> that they had
not the Courage to appear in the Streets: And if
by good Fortune the <HI>Captain Ba&s;&s;a</HI> had not arriv'd
with &s;even Galleys, 'tis hard to divine what might
have been the i&s;&s;ue of the&s;e Di&s;turbances. You
may ea&s;ily conclude, that our Country-men, after
&s;uch late and fatal Experience of the Barbarity of
tho&s;e Infidels, are extremely alarm'd at the News
<PB N="306" REF="175">
of their Arrival: And their Fears are encreas'd
by the Advice they have receiv'd from <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople,</HI>
that there were two <HI>Frenchmen</HI> murder<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d by
'em there in their own Hou&s;es. 'Tis true, the
two <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Nations have hitherto &s;uffer'd no|thing
but Words; but who can &s;ecure 'em from
the Danger of being made Sharers in the com|mon
Calamity, if another Tumult &s;hou'd happen.
'Tis impo&s;&s;ible to reflect without Horror on their
manner of attacking a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> that has the Mi&s;|fortune
to come in their way. As &s;oon as they
perceive him at a Di&s;tance, they draw their Poni|ards,
and with a Howling and Wolvi&s;h Noi&s;e, run
bellowing out the&s;e Words, <HI>alla, alla, alla,</HI> in the
&s;ame Tone they u&s;e when they board a Ship. In
&s;uch Ca&s;es 'tis in vain to think of Re&s;i&s;tance; and
as &s;oon as a Man &s;ees 'em coming, he mu&s;t place
his only Confidence in the Swiftne&s;s of his Legs;
For if a <HI>Turk</HI> &s;hou'd offer to &s;top 'em, they wou'd
infallibly turn their Poniards again&s;t him.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the fatal and inevitable Con&s;equences
of the Weakne&s;s of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Government: And
the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> mu&s;t be a tame Spectator of the
In&s;olency of three or four Hundred Scoundrels,
(for there were no more of 'em,) and patiently &s;uf|fer
'em to domineer over a great City, &s;light his
<HI>Grand Mandamus</HI>'s, and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate almo&s;t under his
Whiskers tho&s;e whom he had taken into his Pro|tection
in &s;o particular a manner.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent <HI>French Con&s;ul</HI> has been very unfortu|nate
in the Di&s;charge of his Office. He has been
twice affronted by the <HI>Barbarians;</HI> and be&s;ides, he
has a very &s;mall Share in the Amba&s;&s;ador's Friend|&s;hip,
and is yet le&s;s belov'd by the Nation, who
take all Occa&s;ions to mortifie him. T'other Day
there happen'd a Quarrel between him and the
<HI>Capuchins,</HI> who are Curates of the Pari&s;h, on the
Occa&s;ion of the Election of a Grand-Vicar. For
<PB N="307" REF="175">
the <HI>Con&s;ul</HI> was per&s;uaded by the <HI>Je&s;uites</HI> to promote
one whom they recommended to him, and re|&s;olv'd
to make him Officiate on S. <HI>Lewis</HI>'s Day,
and pronounce that Saint's Panegyrick. The <HI>Ca|puchins</HI>
wou'd not own the new Vicar, and were
&s;o incens'd again&s;t the <HI>Con&s;ul,</HI> that they threaten'd
to &s;hut the Doors of their Church; but perceiving
that he was re&s;olv'd to break 'em open, they were
unwilling to expo&s;e them&s;elves to &s;o publick an
Affront, and contented them&s;elves with giving out
that they wou'd Excommunicate the <HI>Con&s;ul,</HI> who
laugh'd at their Anger, and told 'em in a deriding
manner, that &s;ince nothing le&s;s than Excommuni|cation
wou'd &s;atisfie 'em, he wou'd let 'em know
that he cou'd Excommunicate as well as they,
and that they &s;hou'd find his Sentences more ef|fectual
than theirs were wont to be. This <HI>Con|&s;ul</HI>
is ab&s;olutely govern'd by the <HI>Je&s;uites,</HI> and &s;o
intirely devoted to 'em, that he can't live with|out
'em. Among the Marks of his Affection to
that Order, I may reckon the late &s;plendid Enter|tainment
which he gave to Father <HI>Grimaldy,</HI> who
pa&s;s'd by this Place in his Return from <HI>China,</HI>
from whence he was &s;ent with the Character of
an <HI>Envoy</HI> to the <HI>French</HI> King. This <HI>Je&s;uit</HI> has a
&s;trange Ambition to appear Great, and talks per|petually
of the Honours he receives from the King
of <HI>China,</HI> and of the Favours that Monarch be|&s;tows
on &s;ome other Fathers of the Society, whom
he has made <HI>Mandarin's</HI> of the fir&s;t Order. It mu&s;t
be acknowledg'd, that the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> are perfect Ma|&s;ters
of the Art of Intriguing; they have always

the Affection of Princes, and have manag'd their
Ambitious De&s;igns with &s;o much Dexterity and
Succe&s;s, that we have already &s;een &s;ome Fathers
of that Order dignify'd with the Title of Emba&s;|&s;adors
by the Courts of <HI>Siam, China, Poland, Tar|tary,

&amp;c.</HI> You &s;ee, Sir, how &s;uitable their Actions
are to the pretended Humility of their Profe&s;&s;ion:
And I leave you to judge with what Confidence
they can boa&s;t of their renouncing Eccle&s;ia&s;tical
Dignities, while they court Secular Preferments
with &s;o much Eagerne&s;s.</P>
<P>In the Account I gave you of the Temper and
Di&s;po&s;ition of the <HI>Turks,</HI> I forgot to take notice
of their &s;urprizing Neglect of the Public Int're&s;t,
in which Re&s;pect they run exactly Counter to the
Maxims that are ob&s;erv'd in all well-govern'd States.
If we con&s;ider this incurable Flaw in their Go|vernment,
we may venture to conclude that Po|&s;terity
will not find many Objects of Admiration
in the future Monuments of their Power and Glo|ry.
If the <HI>Aegyptians, Greeks,</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> had not
been in&s;pir'd with a nobler Ardour, we &s;hou'd
not now &s;ee &s;o many Curious and Inqui&s;itive Per&s;ons
undertake &s;uch long and trouble&s;ome Voyages to
vi&s;it the Ruines of their ancient Grandeur, or to
di&s;cover the Medals that give &s;ome light to the Hi|&s;tory
of the Great Men for whom they were coin'd.
The <HI>Turks</HI> are &s;o extremely carele&s;s of the Ma|nagement
of Publick Affairs, that their Streets are
not &s;o much as pav'd; and I'm apt to think there
wou'd not be a Fountain in their Cities, nor a
Bridge on their Rivers, if &s;ome dying Per&s;ons did
not bequeath Legacies to be employ'd in erecting
&s;uch u&s;eful Works. The ill Po&s;ture of Affairs in
this Country is a natural Con&s;equence of the
Con&s;titution of the Government; for what Or|der
can be expected in a place where there are
no incorporated Societies, Town-Hou&s;es, Sheriffs,
or Burgo-ma&s;ters. They have no Publick Buil|dings
or Walks, and their Cities are extremely
ill-built. There are no fixt Po&s;ts nor Couriers;
&s;o that when a Man has occa&s;ion to write to any
remote place, except <HI>Con&s;tantinople, Aleppo,</HI> or <HI>Cairo,</HI>

he mu&s;t &s;ometimes wait a whole Year for an Oc|ca&s;ion;
and even between <HI>Smyrna</HI> and <HI>Con&s;tantino|ple</HI>
there are only <HI>Arabs</HI> who go a-foot, and fre|quently
&s;tay a Month before they &s;et out. I
leave you to judge how &s;tale the News mu&s;t
come to &s;everal places, and what an univer&s;al Ig|norance
mu&s;t reign throughout the Empire. There
are &s;ome <HI>Turks</HI> who know not &s;o much as the
Name of the reigning <HI>Sultan;</HI> and even in the
places that are mo&s;t frequented, by rea&s;on of their
Conveniency for Traffick, &s;uch as <HI>Smyrna,</HI> the In|habitan's
are &s;carce acquainted with the mo&s;t im|portant
Tran&s;actions in the World. For they ne|ver
publi&s;h any Books, Journals, Gazettes, or the
lea&s;t Account of Publick Affairs; nor do I be|lieve
that there is in all <HI>Turkey</HI> a Man capable of
&s;uch an Undertaking. The Time they allow for
the Improvement of their Knowledge is intirely
&s;pent in &s;tudying the Art of Magical Divination
and Fortune-telling, which they have borrow'd
from the <HI>Arabs,</HI> and have &s;o high an Opinion of,
that they e&s;teem it a nece&s;&s;ary Qualification in
one that pretends to Learning. There is a very
famous Sooth&s;ayer in this place, call'd <HI>Solyman A|ga,</HI>
of whom I heard &s;o many Wonders, that I
went on purpo&s;e to &s;ee whether there was any
Solidity in &s;o &s;u&s;pected a Science. When I came
to the Place of his Abode, I found a Man who&s;e
Mien and A&s;pect was exactly &s;uitable to the <HI>Idea</HI>
we u&s;ually have of a <HI>Magician;</HI> for he was black and
lean, his Looks was gloomy and di&s;mal, and his
Beard almo&s;t cover'd his Brea&s;t; and be&s;ides, he
had about twenty <HI>Arabick</HI> Books full of Figures. As
&s;oon as I enter'd, I told him, by a Friend that
perform'd the Office of an Interpreter betwixt us,
that the Fame of his great Learning had drawn
me to &s;ee him; and begg'd him to acquaint me
with &s;ome part of my future De&s;tiny. He re|ply'd
<PB N="310" REF="178">
that I was a <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> that my Friend was
al&s;o a <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> and that con&s;equently we were
Brothers. I was not at all pleas'd with &s;o imper|tinent
an An&s;wer; but &s;ince I knew that the <HI>Turks</HI>
are extremely fond of Sentences, I look'd upon
his Bluntne&s;s to be an Effect of his Humour, and
de&s;ir'd my Friend to ask him whether he cou'd
give me a particular Information concerning my
Fortune. <HI>Yes,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>and more than that; if
you plea&s;e I will make you Di&s;cour&s;e with the black
Angel, who will teach you to &s;peak all &s;orts of Lan|guages.</HI>
Since my only de&s;ign was to di&s;cover
the utmo&s;t Reach of his Skill, I took him at his
Word, and earne&s;tly pray'd him to &s;hew me the
Angel, which he promis'd to do the next Morn|ing
at the Hour of <HI>Quindi.</HI> When I return'd at
the appointed Time, I found him extremely
puzzl'd to find out &s;ome way to &s;ave his Credit,
and that he was re&s;olv'd either to flinch from his
Promi&s;e, or to fright me from demanding the
performance of it: For at fir&s;t he ask'd me a Hun|dred
Crowns, concluding that I wou'd not pur|cha&s;e
the Satisfaction of my Curio&s;ity at &s;o dear
a Rate: However, I re&s;olv'd to touch him in the
mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Part, knowing that he wou'd be ex|tremely
concern'd for the Lo&s;s of his Reputati|on.
I told him then that I perceiv'd his Learn|ing
was not &s;o profound as he pretended, and
that if he were not &s;en&s;ible of his own Igno|rance,
he wou'd not demand &s;o extravagant a
Summ for &s;o &s;mall a Matter. The&s;e Words, as I
expected, had &s;ome Influence upon him; for he
told me, but to convince me of the Injury I
did him by &s;u&s;pecting the Truth of his Preten&s;i|ons,
he wou'd &s;how me the Angel, and wou'd
make me &s;peak to him for fifty Crowns. But he
was extremely &s;urpriz'd, when in&s;tead of endea|vouring
to beat down the Price, as he concluded
<PB N="311" REF="178">
I wou'd, I immediately agreed to the Bargain:
However, he conceal'd the Perplexity of his
Thoughts as well as he cou'd, and endeavour'd
to find out &s;ome other Starting-Hole. He a&s;&s;ur'd
me that he wou'd gladly give me the Satisfaction
I de&s;ir'd, but the Ceremony cou'd not be perform'd
till one a-Clock in the Morning: He advis'd me
therefore not to place too much Confidence in
my Courage, which cou'd not pre&s;erve me from
being &s;eiz'd with an A&s;toni&s;hment and Terror
that might be attended with very dangerous Con|&s;equences.
He added a hundred other Rea&s;ons to
deter me from adventuring on &s;o hazardous a piece
of Curio&s;ity; but at la&s;t, perceiving that I conti|nu'd
fix'd in my Re&s;olution, he promis'd to &s;atis|fie
me that Night, and began to talk of Perfumes,
Characters, and Evocations, which were &s;o far
from Daunting either me or my Friend, that we
return'd thither in the Evening, well arm'd, and
re&s;olv'd to Fire briskly at the Devil if he &s;hou'd
have the Confidence to attack us. If you &s;hou'd
ask me what made me &s;o de&s;irous to be acquaint|ed
with Mon&s;ieur <HI>le Diable,</HI> and what Bus'ne&s;s I had
to do with him, I &s;hou'd be exremely puzzl'd to
give you a &s;atisfactory An&s;wer: But to deal plain|ly
with you, I did not believe that 'twas in the
Conjurer's Power to bring us to a Sight of him,
and 'twas that perhaps that made me &s;o re&s;olute
and couragious. At la&s;t Midnight being come, he
began to prepare his Perfumes, and to bring his
Books and In&s;truments, which I concluded he did
only to amu&s;e us; and after all the&s;e Ceremo|nies,
he told us that by rea&s;on of the Ob&s;curity
of the Moon he cou'd not &s;hew us the Angel, but
he wou'd make him &s;peak to us in <HI>Arabick, Tur|ki&s;h,</HI>
or <HI>Italian,</HI> which we pleas'd. This unexpe|cted
Shuffling convinc'd me that he was an Im|po&s;tor,
and I was &s;o enrag'd at the Di&s;appoint|ment,
<PB N="312" REF="179">
that I left him without daining to re|turn
an An&s;wer, and immediately went to my
Lodgings.</P>
<P>By this In&s;tance you may judge of the boa&s;t|ed
Skill of all tho&s;e feign'd <HI>Arabian</HI> Magicians;
for this Man was reputed one of the mo&s;t learn'd
Profe&s;&s;ors of that Art in <HI>A&s;ia:</HI> And yet 'tis as
certain as you may think it incredible, that &s;ome
<HI>Franks</HI> are &s;o be&s;otted with tho&s;e my&s;tical Foole|ries,
that they are not a&s;ham'd to imploy all their
Time in &s;o u&s;ele&s;s an Occupation. I know a ve|ry
expert and much-e&s;teem'd Painter, call'd <HI>Le
Brun,</HI> who neglecting his Bus'ne&s;s, applies him&s;elf
wholly to the Study of <HI>Divination,</HI> and &s;pends
whole Days in turning over his Magical Books,
which he procures to be tran&s;lated into <HI>French</HI> at a
very con&s;iderable Charge. But notwith&s;tanding all
the Confidence of this pretended Diviner, 'tis im|po&s;&s;ible
that his Art can be true, &s;ince the very
Principles on which it depends, are certainly fal&s;e;
and to convince you of the Ab&s;urdity of his Pre|ten&s;ions,
'twill be &s;ufficient to acquaint you with his
u&s;ual Method of Divining. He has two little Bones
with Eight Sides a-piece, on each of which there is
a &s;mall Character engrav'd; and when you pro|po&s;e
your Que&s;tion, he throws the Bones, and ob|&s;erves
the Characters that appear on the &s;ides that
happen to be uppermo&s;t. Then having made &s;e|veral
Combinations of the&s;e Characters, with cer|tain
Numbers, according to the Subject of the
Que&s;tion, he draws a Scheme or Figure, which he
&s;eeks in one of his Books, where he finds a Sen|tence
written, which he fancies to be the de&s;ir'd
Solution. Thus you &s;ee 'tis plain that the whole
My&s;tery depends on the Fortune of the Dice: But
when I endeavour'd to convince him of the Un|certainty
of his Art which betray'd him into &s;o
many Errors, that not One An&s;wer in Thirty was
<PB N="313" REF="179">
found to be exactly true, he reply'd very grave|ly,
that the&s;e Mi&s;takes were occa&s;ion'd by his
Ignorance, and that he did not yet comprehend
the Depths of that infallible Science; adding, as a
Confirmation of the Certainty of the Art, that
notwith&s;tanding the &s;mall Progre&s;s he had made in
it, he never found that his Book had return'd a
Cro&s;s or Impertinent An&s;wer. And to convince
me of the Truth of his A&s;&s;ertion, he made &s;eve|ral
Tryals in my Pre&s;ence, and I ob&s;erv'd always
that the An&s;wer, whether True or Fal&s;e, related to
the Subject of the Que&s;tion; nor will I &s;cruple to
confe&s;s that I was &s;omewhat &s;urpriz'd at &s;o odd an
Effect of Chance.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> are al&s;o very much addicted to the &s;tu|dy
of the <HI>Philo&s;opher's Stone,</HI> or the Art of making
Gold and Silver; and I remember a &s;tory on this
Subject, which I had from a <HI>Turk,</HI> who is reckon'd
a Man of Honour. Two <HI>Per&s;ian Dervi&s;es</HI> came to
<HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> about four Years ago, and after they
had &s;taid a Fortnight, told their Landlord, that
tho' they had no Money to pay for their Lodg|ing
and Entertainment, they were re&s;olv'd not to
go away without giving him entire Satisfaction.
I know not what Credit he gave to their Pro|mi&s;es,
but he quickly perceiv'd the Effect of 'em,
for they took a large Copper-Di&s;h, which they
found in the Hou&s;e, and having melted it down
in his Pre&s;ence, threw a little Powder upon it,
which immediately chang'd the Copper into Sil|ver.
They retain'd one half for them&s;elves, and
left the other with their Landlord, who upon try|al
found it to be true Silver: And be&s;ides, they
pre&s;ented him with a &s;mall Quantity of the
Powder. The <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier I&s;mael,</HI> hearing of this
Accident, &s;ent for the Man, and oblig'd him to
deliver up the Powder, which he &s;how'd to &s;e|veral
expert <HI>Chymi&s;ts,</HI> who according to his Orders,
<PB N="314" REF="180">
endeavour'd to find out the Secret. But all their
Attempts were un&s;ucce&s;sful; and I'm the rather in|clin'd
to believe the Conclu&s;ion of the Story, be|cau&s;e
I look upon this Art to be no le&s;s frivolous
and uncertain than that of <HI>Divination.</HI></P>

<P>IN compliance with your De&s;ire I &s;hall in this
Letter, pre&s;ent you with a &s;hort View of the
Life of <HI>Soliman,</HI> Emperour of the <HI>Turks,</HI> who died
<HI>June</HI> 22. and was &s;ucceeded by his younger Bro|ther,
<HI>Achmet.</HI></P>
<P>The pre&s;ent <HI>Grand Signior, Achmet,</HI> the deceas'd
<HI>Soliman,</HI> and the depos'd <HI>Sultan Mahomet,</HI> were three
Brothers, the Sons of <HI>Sultan Ibrahim,</HI> who was
&s;trangl'd in the Ca&s;tle of the <HI>Seven Towers,</HI> in the
heat of one of tho&s;e mutinous Tumults of the <HI>Ja|nizaries,</HI>
that happen &s;o frequently in this Country.
His elde&s;t Son <HI>Mahomet,</HI> who was then very young, was
declar'd Emperour by the Intere&s;t and Solicitation
of the <HI>Sultana</HI> Mother, and of the famous <HI>Vi&s;ie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">,
Kopergli,</HI> who ow'd his Advancement to her, and
ever afterwards &s;erv'd her with an inviolable Fide|lity.
This Prince's Reign may be ju&s;tly reckon'd
di&s;a&s;trous; for not to mention tho&s;e frequent and
terrible Seditions that made him tremble &s;o often,
and in one of which he was at la&s;t dethron'd, his
<PB N="315" REF="180">
Armies were &s;everal times <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">outed by the <HI>Venetians,</HI>
and the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> before his Death, had al|mo&s;t
driven him quite out of <HI>Hungary.</HI> The
<HI>Turks,</HI> who are the mo&s;t ungovernable Subjects in
the World to an unfortunate Prince, and who are
po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with a Belief of a certain Prede&s;tination,
that over-rules the Fate of their Emperour on which
they imagine the Fortune of the Empire depends,
concluded that the Reign of <HI>Mahomet</HI> would be a
perpetual Scene of Di&s;a&s;ters: and the Grandees en|courag'd
the Super&s;tition of the People, in Expectation
of a favourable Opportunity to execute the De&s;igns
they had premeditated again&s;t the Government.
They cou'd not have de&s;ir'd a more inviting Juncture
to attempt and carry on &s;o va&s;t an Undertaking, than
the Di&s;turbances that were occa&s;ion'd by the ill Suc|ce&s;s
of the Campaign of 1687. and e&s;pecially by
the Lo&s;s of the Famous Battle of <HI>Her&s;an;</HI> where
the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> kill'd Ten thou&s;and <HI>Turks</HI> on the Spot,
pillag'd their Camp, made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of
Ninety Pieces of Cannon, and their whole Train
of Artillery. The Con&s;ternation that was occa&s;i|on'd
among the <HI>Turks</HI> by the News of this Defeat,
was encreas'd by the Advice they receiv'd almo&s;t at
the &s;ame time that the Bridge of <HI>E&s;&s;eck</HI> was &s;eiz'd
by the Count <HI>de Dunevalt,</HI> immediately after the
Victory. The <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier,</HI> who commanded the
Army in Per&s;on, dreading the u&s;ual Fate of his
Predece&s;&s;ors on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, endeavour'd to &s;e|cure
him&s;elf by laying the Blame on the Generals
that commanded under him; and re&s;olving to pre|vent
the De&s;igns of his Enemies, per&s;waded the
<HI>Grand Signior</HI> to put 'em to Death. But tho' the
Orders for that Effect were actually given out,
there was &s;o &s;trong a Party already form'd both
again&s;t the <HI>Vi&s;ier</HI> and the <HI>Sultan,</HI> that the Great Of|ficers
of the Army, with the <HI>Chiaoux Ba&s;&s;a</HI> at their
Head, made the whole Army revolt, and march'd
<PB N="316" REF="181">
towards <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> with a Re&s;olution to depo&s;e
<HI>Mahomet,</HI> and place his Brother <HI>Soliman</HI> on the
Throne. The News of their Approach &s;o terrifi'd
the <HI>Sultan,</HI> that knowing no orher Way to appea&s;e
the Fury of the Rebels, he abandon'd the <HI>Grand vi|&s;ier,</HI>
and &s;ent the Imperial Signet to the <HI>Chiaoux Ba&s;|&s;a,</HI>
whom he thought to gain by &s;atisfying his Am|bition.
But he quickly found that the Danger was
greater than he imagin'd; for that Officer declar'd
that he would not accept the <HI>Sultan</HI>'s Offer till the
<HI>Grand Vi&s;ier, Tefterdar,</HI> Receiver of the Cu&s;toms, the
<HI>Caimacan,</HI> and &s;ome others whom he nam'd, were
put to Death. The Per&s;ons who&s;e Heads he de|manded
were the only faithful Servants of the
<HI>Grand Signior,</HI> who was extremely perplex'd at &s;o
unwelcome a Propo&s;al; knowing that his <HI>Vi&s;ier</HI>'s
Death wou'd infallibly put a Period to his own
Life, or at lea&s;t to his Reign. However the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of his Affairs con&s;train'd him at la&s;t to &s;ign
the fatal Order: the unfortunate <HI>Vi&s;ier</HI> was
&s;trangl'd, and his Head &s;ent to the <HI>Chiaoux Ba&s;&s;a,</HI>
who was &s;o far from being appeas'd, that his In&s;o|lence
was heighten'd by this Mark of the <HI>Sultan</HI>'s
Conde&s;cen&s;ion. He di&s;mi&s;s'd the Me&s;&s;engers with
Scorn, telling 'em in a domineering Manner, That
they cou'd not ju&s;tly expect he wou'd be &s;atisfied
with one Head in&s;tead of Twenty which he had
demanded; and that this way of proceeding con|vinc'd
him that the Government was not much con|cern'd
for the Quiet of the Empire. Thus the <HI>Sul|tan</HI>
was con&s;train'd to &s;end all the re&s;t of the Offi|cers
whom tho&s;e in&s;olent Rebels requir'd; and
&s;oon after perceiv'd there was no Hope of reducing
'em to a Sence of their Duty: for all the Pri&s;oners
were barbarou&s;ly murder'd in the Middle of the Ar|my
by the <HI>Chiaoux Ba&s;&s;a</HI>'s Order. This la&s;t Act of In|humanity
&s;truck &s;uch a Terrour into the <HI>Grand Sig|nior</HI>'s
Mind, that concluding him&s;elf to be irreco|verably
<PB N="317" REF="181">
lo&s;t, he re&s;olv'd in the Fury of his De&s;pair
to put to Death all his Brothers and Sons. To
comprehend the Rea&s;on of this di&s;mal Re&s;olution,
you mu&s;t know that the Religion of the <HI>Turks</HI> in|&s;pires
'em with a certain Veneration for the <HI>Otto|man</HI>
Blood, that over-awes 'em ev'n in the the
mid&s;t of the mo&s;t terrible Seditions, and is &s;o deep|ly
rooted in their Minds, that they wou'd rather
chu&s;e to &s;uffer the mo&s;t cruel Death than to &s;ee
the Throne po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by a Prince of another Fami|ly.
And therefore 'tis the u&s;ual Cu&s;tom of tho&s;e
Emperours to begin their Reign with the Death of
their Brothers, that the Throne may be &s;ecur'd from
the Attempts of &s;o many dangerous Pretenders.
Thus <HI>Sultan Amurath,</HI> the Uncle of the&s;e three Em|perours,
put to Death all the Males of the Family;
and if the Tenderne&s;s of a Mother had not prom|pted
the <HI>Sultana Valid&eacute;</HI> to hide <HI>Ibrahim,</HI> who was the
Younge&s;t, the whole Race had been extingu&s;h'd. For
the <HI>Sultans</HI> are more concern'd for their own Secu|rity
than for the Pre&s;ervation of the Royal Line.
Neverthele&s;s <HI>Sultan Mahomet</HI> wou'd never hearken
to the Per&s;wa&s;ions of &s;ome of his Coun&s;ellours,
who advis'd him to put that cruel Maxim in Exe|cution,
and endeavour'd to make him &s;en&s;ible that
the Quiet of the Empire could never be &s;ecur'd but by
the Death of <HI>Soliman</HI> and <HI>Achmet.</HI> But &s;ince he wou'd
not put 'em to death while they were in his Power,
he found, at la&s;t, that he cou'd not execute that
bloody Re&s;olution when his De&s;pair con&s;train'd
him to attempt it: for the <HI>Bo&s;tangi Ba&s;&s;a,</HI> who was
one of the Con&s;pirators, carry'd the two Princes to
the old <HI>Seraglio</HI> under a &s;trong Guard, who mock'd
the <HI>Sultan</HI> when he demanded to be admitted with
&s;ome of his Servants; and the Army was already
po&s;ted in and about <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> That Night a
Council of the Great Officers was held in <HI>Santa-Sophia,</HI>
where they came to a final Re&s;olution to
<PB N="318" REF="182">
place <HI>Soliman</HI> on the Throne, and he was declar'd
Emperour the next Day with univer&s;al Accla|mations
of Joy. Thus <HI>Mahomet</HI> was depos'd, and
<HI>Soliman,</HI> who was no le&s;s aver&s;e to Cruelty than his
Brother, contented him&s;elf with ordaining that he
&s;hou'd receive the &s;ame Treatment which he had
made him &s;uffer for &s;o many Years. When the
<HI>Capigi Ba&s;&s;a</HI> came to &s;ecure his Per&s;on, and to ac|quaint
him with the New Emperour's Order, he
found him on the <HI>Sopha</HI> drinking Coffee, with a
Serenity of Mind that may be almo&s;t reckon'd a
Prodigy, con&s;idering the deplorable Circum&s;tances
of his Condition. He &s;ubmitted without making
the lea&s;t Re&s;i&s;tance, &s;aying, <HI>That it was impo&s;&s;ible
to oppo&s;e the Decrees of Heav'n, and that what&s;oever is
prede&s;tinated mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily happen.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time the <HI>Caimacan,</HI> who was one
of <HI>Sultan Mahomet</HI>'s Favorites, had the good For|tune
or Intere&s;t, to &s;ecure him&s;elf from being en|roll'd
among the re&s;t of tho&s;e mi&s;erable Victims
that were &s;acrific'd to the Fury of the <HI>Chiaoux Ba&s;&s;a.</HI>
But a&s;&s;oon as he perceiv'd that his Ma&s;ter was irreco|verably
ruin'd, he re&s;olv'd to prevent the implacable
Malice of his Enemies by a &s;peedy flight: and con&s;i|dering
that <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> was the only Place where
he could expect to &s;ecure his Life, he embark'd
that Night on a Saique accompany'd only with
one Servant; and having made a &s;ufficient Provi&s;i|on
of Gold, Silver, and Jewels, attempted to get
into a <HI>French</HI> Ve&s;&s;el of <HI>Ciotad,</HI> commanded by one
Captain <HI>Crevilliers:</HI> but the Mariners who had been
already alarm'd with the News of tho&s;e terrible Di|&s;turbanees,
wou'd not &s;uffer him to approach the
Ship till he had declar'd his Name, and acquainted
'em, that the <HI>Caimacan</HI> of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> de&s;ir'd to
&s;peak with the Captain. A&s;&s;oon as the Captain ap|pear'd,
the <HI>Caimacan</HI> intreated him to receive him
on Board his Ship, and tran&s;port him to <HI>France;</HI>
<PB N="319" REF="182">
a&s;&s;uring him that he might &s;et &s;ail the next night with|out
any Oppo&s;ition, and offering Twenty thou&s;and
<HI>Sequins,</HI> or Fifty thou&s;and Crowns for his Pa&s;&s;age.
This was a very tempting Offer to the Captain,
and he has &s;ince told me, that he wou'd have mo&s;t
willingly accepted it, if the <HI>Caimacan</HI> had had the
the Prudence to conceal his Name; but &s;ince both
that and his Quality was known by the whole
Ship's Company, neither Compa&s;&s;ion nor Covetou&s;|ne&s;s
cou'd prevail with the Captain to run &s;o great
a Hazard; &s;o that the poor <HI>Caimacan</HI> was forc'd to
&s;teer his Cour&s;e towards the Canal of the Black Sea,
thinking to make his E&s;cape that way. But he was
quickly di&s;cover'd by the great Quantity of Silver
which he had about him, and was brought back
to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> where he was beheaded. A Hun|dred
other <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's</HI> underwent the &s;ame Fate; and
the <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier</HI> giving a full Career to his Spite
and Revenge, fill'd the whole City with Blood
and Slaughter. There was nothing to be &s;een in
the Streets but <HI>Janizaries</HI> and <HI>Spahi's,</HI> a&s;&s;aulting and
murdering tho&s;e whom they met; and no Man
when he ro&s;e in the Morning was &s;ure of going to
Bed at Night. The <HI>Franks</HI> were extremely afraid,
le&s;t the Storm &s;hould fall on them: the Amba&s;&s;a|dours
&s;ecur'd their Hou&s;es with &s;trong Guards, and
all the Ve&s;&s;els in the Port, <HI>Engli&s;h, French, Dutch</HI>
and <HI>Venetian,</HI> join'd together, and put out to Sea,
with a Re&s;olution to defend them&s;elves to the la&s;t
Extremity, in ca&s;e they &s;hou'd be attack'd. To
conclude; I have heard &s;ome <HI>Turks,</HI> who are both
very old, and well skill'd in the Hi&s;tory of their
Country, affirm, That the Quiet of the Empire
was never di&s;turb'd by a more Bloody Sedition.
However 'twas at la&s;t appeas'd, tho' the Calm
la&s;ted not long; for in <HI>March</HI> there broke forth
another terrible In&s;urrection again&s;t the New <HI>Sultan,</HI>
whom all Men began to look upon as incapable of
<PB N="320" REF="183">
the Government. Nor were they much mi&s;taken
in their Opinion of him, and 'tis &s;trange they did
not &s;ooner fore&s;ee the dangerons Con&s;equences
of &s;o great a Revolution; for how cou'd a Man
learn the Art of Ruling &s;o trouble&s;ome an Empire,
who had &s;pent his whole Life in a clo&s;e Pri&s;on,
where he cou'd only conver&s;e with Books, and was &s;o
perfect a Stranger to the Management of Affairs,
that he was ignorant ev'n in the mo&s;t common
Things. Thus the be&s;t Quality they could expect
or de&s;ire him to be indu'd with, was an Ea&s;ine&s;s of
Temper, and a Willingne&s;s to be ab&s;olutely go|vern'd
by his Mini&s;ters; and indeed it may be &s;aid,
that there was never a more tractable Prince; for
during the whole Cour&s;e of his Reign he never made
U&s;e of his Ab&s;olute Power in any one Act, but
only in pre&s;erving his Brothers, whom he was
often advis'd to put to Death; e&s;pecially on this
Occa&s;ion, when the Rebels threaten'd to re&s;tore
<HI>Mahomet</HI> to the Throne, and had almo&s;t effected
their Re&s;olution: for the <HI>Vi&s;ier</HI> was ma&s;&s;acr'd in his
own Hou&s;e by the <HI>Janizaries,</HI> who were the Au|thors
of the Revolt, and had made them&s;elves
Ma&s;ters of the City. But the <HI>Sultan</HI> having very
&s;ea&s;onably di&s;play'd the Banner of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> the
<HI>Saphi's,</HI> the <HI>Leventi,</HI> and the People run to his A&s;&s;i|&s;tance,
and di&s;pers'd the the <HI>Janizaries.</HI> After the
Tumult was calm'd, the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI> of <HI>Natolia,</HI> who
headed the Rebels, was oblig'd to beg Pardon, and
above Five hundred of the Mutineers were hang'd;
tho' their Death made but a poor Amends for a
whole Quarter of the City, and above Twenty
Galleys and Sultana's which they had burnt.
'Twou'd be needle&s;s to give you a more particu|lar
Relation of the&s;e Accidents, &s;ince you have doubt|le&s;s
read an Account of 'em in your publick Jour|nals
or News-Papers; and the only Rea&s;on why I
mention'd 'em, is becau&s;e they give &s;ome Light to
<PB N="321" REF="183">
the Tran&s;actions that &s;ucceeded 'em, which perhaps
have not yet come to your knowledge. While the
whole City was in a terrible Combu&s;tion, and the <HI>Le|venti</HI>
animated by a De&s;ire of Plunder, were &s;eeking
an Occa&s;ion of breaking forth into fre&s;h Di&s;orders,
there came a whole Troop of 'em to the <HI>French</HI> Am|ba&s;&s;adour's
Palace, and in a very in&s;olent Man|ner
de&s;ir'd him to receive a certain beggarly <HI>Greek,</HI>
whom they brought along with 'em, to be his <HI>Drugger-Man,</HI>
or Interpreter. At fir&s;t <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Girardin</HI>
rejected the Propo&s;al, telling 'em that he did not
want a <HI>Drugger-Man,</HI> and would not take one upon
their Recommendation; but &s;eeing they began to
be unruly, and threaten to &s;et Fire to his Hou&s;e,
he grew more complai&s;ant, and receiv'd the <HI>Drug|ger-Man</HI>
more civilly. Nor can he be blam'd for
&s;uffering him&s;elf to be hector'd by the Rabble,
&s;ince 'tis certainly the wi&s;e&s;t Cour&s;e to &s;ubmit on
&s;uch Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>After the Sedition was quieted, <HI>Soliman</HI> retir'd to
<HI>Adrianople;</HI> for he did not think him&s;elf &s;afe in a
City that becomes the <HI>Sultan</HI>'s Pri&s;on upon the
fir&s;t breaking forth of an In&s;urrection; and after
that time he never re&s;ided in it. He conferr'd
the Dignity of <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier</HI> on one <HI>I&s;mael Ba&s;&s;a,</HI>
a Man without Experience, and one who had no|thing
to recommend him but the Favour of his
Ma&s;ter. No &s;ooner was he intru&s;ted with the
Admini&s;tration of the Government, but the Em|pire
was over-run with tho&s;e Di&s;orders and Con|fu&s;ions
that are the natural Con&s;equences of the
Unskilfulne&s;s of the Principal Mini&s;ter of State.
Several <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's</HI> began to form Cabals, and enter
into &s;eparate A&s;&s;ociations. Some e&s;pous'd the In|tere&s;t
of the <HI>Sultane&s;s,</HI> the Mother of the depos'd
<HI>Mahomet,</HI> who plotted to re&s;tore her Son; others
declar'd in Favour of one <HI>Jeghen Ba&s;&s;a,</HI> who pre|tended
to be of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Race: &s;ome re&s;olv'd
<PB N="322" REF="184">
to be independent, without acknowledging any
Head of their Party, and all in general re&s;us'd to
&s;ubmit to the pre&s;ent Government.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Emperour carry'd on the
War very pro&s;perou&s;ly; for the Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI>
took <HI>Belgrade</HI> by Storm, and the Prince of <HI>Baden,</HI>
after he had defeated the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Bo&s;nia,</HI> made
him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of the whole Province. The next
Year was remarkable for more Signal and Glorious
Advantages; for the Prince of <HI>Baden,</HI> who com|manded
the Imperial Army in <HI>Hungary,</HI> fought
three Battles &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, and obtain'd as many
important Victories.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Battle was fought near <HI>Pa&s;&s;arowitz,</HI>
where the <HI>Turks</HI> lo&s;t &s;even Thou&s;and Men, a hun|dred
Pieces of Cannon, all their Bombs, Carca&s;&s;es,
Mortars, Powder, Tents, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The &s;econd Victo|ry
was obtain'd on the 24<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>September,</HI> near <HI>Ni&s;&s;a,</HI>
where the <HI>Sera&s;quier</HI> who commanded in Per&s;on,
cou'd not prevent the Lo&s;s of all his Cannon, and
eight Thou&s;and Soldiers. The third Battel was
fought near <HI>Widen;</HI> and during the Heat of the
Action, the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> carry'd the Town by Storm.
Be&s;ides, the Prince of <HI>Baden</HI> had taken <HI>Ni&s;&s;a, Zwor|nick,
Nowigrath, Ar&s;owath,</HI> and &s;everal other Pla|ces,
which open'd a free Pa&s;&s;age into <HI>Bulgaria</HI> and
<HI>Macedonia,</HI> and from thence into <HI>Romania;</HI> &s;o that
if the War had been carry'd on for &s;ome time with
the &s;ame Vigour and Succe&s;s, the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> might
have advanc'd to the Gates of <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> But
in the beginning of the la&s;t Year, the <HI>Vi&s;ier I&s;mael</HI>
was depos'd, and &s;ucceeded by <HI>Kopergli Oglou, Ba&s;&s;a</HI>
of <HI>Scio.</HI> 'Twas then the <HI>Turks</HI> began to hope they
might &s;ee a happy Turn of Affairs; they remem|ber'd
the great Actions of the famous <HI>Vi&s;ier</HI> of that
Name, and were per&s;uaded that this Mini&s;ter wou'd
imitate &s;o glorious a Example. Nor were they
di&s;appointed in their Expectation; for the new
<PB N="323" REF="184">
<HI>Vi&s;ier</HI> was not inferior to his Predece&s;&s;or either in
Valour, Strength of Mind, or any other Endow|ments
that are nece&s;&s;ary to fit a Man for the Ma|nagement
of Affairs; and the Empire was quick|ly
&s;en&s;ible of the Advantageous Influences of his
Government. I have already acquainted you in a
former Letter, with the pro&s;perous Succe&s;s of their
Arms during the la&s;t Campagne, which gave Oc|ca&s;ion
to the <HI>French</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador to take notice of
the Sympathy between the two Empires, and was
afterwards &s;olemniz'd by that Triumph of which I
gave you a &s;hort De&s;cription. And therefore in|&s;tead
of troubling you with a tedious Relation of
tho&s;e Events, which you have doubtle&s;s heard of,
and have not yet forgotten; I &s;hall only tell you, that
if that Great Man had not been kill'd at the Battle
of <HI>Salankemen,</HI> the Chri&s;tians wou'd have had Rea|&s;on
to dread a fatal Revolution, which they cou'd
hardly have prevented any otherwi&s;e, than by a
&s;peedy Peace. And indeed that De&s;ign was carry'd
on &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully, that every one expected a hap|py
Conclu&s;ion of their Negotiations, when they
were unfortunately interrupted by the <HI>Vi&s;ier</HI>'s Death.
For he was not at all aver&s;e to the Propo&s;al, and
was &s;o far from being acted by that ba&s;e Love of
Riches, with which the <HI>Turks</HI> are generally po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd,
that, contrary to the u&s;ual Maxims of his
Predece&s;&s;ors, he pur&s;u'd no other Intere&s;t than
this of the State. He had often di&s;cours'd on that
Subject with <HI>Mon&s;ieur Collier,</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> Amba&s;&s;a|dour,
who&s;e Rea&s;ons made the greater Impre&s;&s;ion
upon him, becau&s;e of the Character he had re|ceiv'd
of his Merit, Capacity, and Dexterity in
publick Negotiations. And that able Mini&s;ter had
prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd the Mind of the <HI>Vi&s;ier</HI> with &s;uch &s;trong
Inclinations to a Peace, that, if we may be al|low'd
to judge by the mo&s;t promi&s;ing Appearances,
he wou'd have actually concluded it, if he had not
<PB N="324" REF="185">
been prevented by Death. For <HI>Mon&s;ieur Collier</HI> had
made &s;o good U&s;e of &s;uch a favourable Opportu|nity,
that almo&s;t all the Articles were agreed on,
and the Emperour had empower'd the Prince of
<HI>Baden</HI> to &s;ign the Treaty; and had appointed the
Counts of <HI>Kinsky</HI> and <HI>Straatman</HI> to be his A&s;&s;i&s;tants.
The King of <HI>Poland</HI> and the Republick of <HI>Venice</HI> had
al&s;o &s;ent their Plenipotentiaries: but in&s;tead of the
much-de&s;ir'd News of a Peace, we receiv'd an Ac|count
of the dreadful Battle of <HI>Salankemen,</HI> in
which the <HI>Vi&s;ier</HI> was one of the fir&s;t that lo&s;t his
Life. The <HI>Aga</HI> of the <HI>Janizaries,</HI> the <HI>Sera&s;quier,</HI>
and Ten other <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's</HI> of Note, had the &s;ame Fate;
and the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Army fled with &s;o much Precipi|tation
and Terrour, that the Memory of the
Olde&s;t Men cannot furni&s;h 'em with an In&s;tance
of &s;o entire a Defeat. They lo&s;t above 20000
Men, all their Cannon and Baggage; and, in a
word, all they had in their Camp. I cannot ex|pre&s;s
the Con&s;ternation that was &s;pread over the
whole <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, by the &s;urprizing and
melancholy News which was brought into this
Country by &s;ome that had the good Fortune to
e&s;cape; who never &s;peak of that Battle without a
certain Dread and Amazement in their Counte|nance,
which gives us a more lively Idea of the
Horrour of that Day, than the mo&s;t particular
Relation that cou'd be made of the Action.</P>
<P><HI>Mon&s;ieur de Chateauneuf</HI> takes &s;o deep a Share in
the Public Sorrow, that I know not whether he
cou'd &s;upport &s;o terrible a Blow, if the <HI>Vi&s;ier</HI>'s
Death did not comfort him a little. For that
Mini&s;ter never had the Happine&s;s of his Favour,
becau&s;e he wou'd not be led by his Advice;
and I know a Man to whom the Amba&s;&s;adour ex|pre&s;s'd
his Thoughts in the&s;e very Words, &s;peak|ing
of a Peace; <HI>'Twill, doubtle&s;s, be &s;peedily conclu|ded,</HI>
&s;aid he; <HI>The Dutch Amba&s;&s;adour is perpetually
<PB N="325" REF="185">
with the Vi&s;ier, and has got &s;uch a Power over him,
that he can undo in one Day all that I am able to do
in Ten.</HI> Nor were his Fears groundle&s;s, for I can
a&s;&s;ure you that Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> is perhaps the fitte&s;t
Man in the World to manage &s;uch a Negotiati|on.
In the fir&s;t place, he knows the Original
of all the Great Men at the Port, and is per|fectly
acquainted with their &s;everal Humours,
Intrigues, and Intere&s;ts. Be&s;ides he is the Son of
an Amba&s;&s;adour, and from his very Birth has
been enur'd to Bu&s;ine&s;s, which by that Means
is become &s;o natural to him, that he manages
the mo&s;t intricate Affairs with a certain happy
Ea&s;ine&s;s that can only be acquir'd by a Per&s;on
of &s;o rare an Indu&s;try, and after a long Re&s;i|dence
at the Court. The&s;e are the Advantages
which <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Chateauneuf</HI> wants: 'tis true, he
has a great deal of Wit, and never &s;leeps away
an Opportunity of Acting; but after all, an Am|ba&s;&s;adour
at his Arrival from <HI>France</HI> may be
reckon'd almo&s;t as great a Stranger at the Port,
as if he had dropt from the Clouds. The Geni|us
and Humour of that Nation is directly oppo&s;ite
to ours, and Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> has &s;tudi'd it &s;o carefully,
and under&s;tands it &s;o perfectly, that he cou'd ea|&s;ily
give the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's</HI> them&s;elves a Le&s;&s;on on this
Subject. So that if <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Chateauneuf</HI> did not
counter-ballance the&s;e Advantages with large Bags of
Gold and Silver, which are always wont to out|weigh
Rea&s;on in <HI>Turkey,</HI> the Peace wou'd have been
long &s;ince concluded. This puts me in Mind of a
Story, which will give you an Idea of the u&s;ual
way of managing Affairs in this place.</P>
<P>The Captain of a <HI>Venetian</HI> Ship, who arriv'd
&s;ome Months ago at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> under the Pro|tection
and Colours of <HI>Holland,</HI> was &s;olicited by
the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;adour to put him&s;elf under his
Protection, and was at la&s;t allur'd to yield to
<PB N="326" REF="186">
that Mini&s;ter's Reque&s;t by the Promi&s;es he
made him to obtain con&s;iderable Favours for
him, both as to the Entry and Exportation of
his Goods. Mr. <HI>Collier,</HI> who upon all Occa&s;ions
maintains the Honour of his Ma&s;ters with the
highe&s;t Zeal and Courage, wou'd not endure an
Affront that &s;eem'd to be directly aim'd at the Re|public.
A&s;&s;oon as he heard of it, he &s;ent Orders
to the Captain to take down the Banner of
<HI>France,</HI> if he was not re&s;olv'd to &s;uffer the ut|mo&s;t
Severity of his ju&s;t Indignation: but that de|luded
Officer &s;lighted the Me&s;&s;age, and &s;o was
him&s;elf the Cau&s;e of all the Misfortunes that af|terwards
befel him. For after his Excellency had
given Notice to the <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier</HI> that there was
a Prize in the Port, Orders were immediately
&s;ent to &s;eize the Ve&s;&s;el, which was declar'd to
be lawful Prize; and the Captain with all the Sea|men
were put in Chains. You may ea&s;ily con|clude
that the <HI>French</HI> were extremely mortifi'd to
&s;ee a hundred Wretches loaded with Fetters, and
&s;old for Slaves, meerly for &s;etting up the Banner
of that Nation. <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Chateauneuf</HI> receiv'd a
very &s;evere Reprimand from <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Pont|chartrain,</HI>
and 'twas generally believ'd that his In|di&s;cretion
on this Occa&s;ion wou'd make him be
recall'd from the Port. In the mean time he
was perpetually at the <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier</HI>'s Gate, im|portuning
him for the Relief of the Ship and
Mariners: but after all his earne&s;t Solicitations,
he cou'd not obtain a more favourable Compo&s;iti|on,
than that he was permitted to redeem the
Men at the Rate of Fifty Crowns a-piece; and
the Ran&s;om of the Ship was fix'd at Ten thou|&s;and
Crowns, which was more than its real Va|lue.
Since that time the Credit of the <HI>French</HI>
Protection is extremely le&s;&s;en'd; and I'm apt to
believe that few Captains will hereafter be guilty
<PB N="327" REF="186">
of the like Imprudence. And even I know &s;everal
<HI>Venetian</HI> Captains who will not put them&s;elves under
the Protection of <HI>France,</HI> becau&s;e the Amba&s;&s;a|dour
has impos'd a Tax of Fifteen thou&s;and
Crowns upon the Ve&s;&s;els of that Nation by way
of Reprizal, for the Money he paid to the <HI>Grand
Vi&s;ier.</HI> This Impo&s;ition occa&s;ions a great murmu|ring
among the <HI>Venetians,</HI> who pretend that he
was oblig'd in Ju&s;tice to redeem the Ve&s;&s;el at
his own Charge, &s;ince he was the only Cau&s;e
of its Misfortune.</P>
<P>I perceive that I have in&s;en&s;ibly wander'd from
my Subject, and am ready to acknowledge that
this wou'd be an unpardonable Fault in an Ex|act
and Methodical Hi&s;tory: but &s;ince I only
promis'd you a clear and faithful Account of
the Ob&s;ervations I &s;hou'd have Occa&s;ion to make
in my Travels, I do not think my &s;elf oblig'd
to make an Apology for every little Digre&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Emperour <HI>Soliman</HI> died on the <HI>twenty &s;e|cond</HI>
of <HI>June</HI> la&s;t: &s;ome believe that his Death
was natural, but others &s;ay that it was occa&s;i|on'd
by the <HI>Sultane&s;s</HI> the Mother of <HI>Mahomet.</HI> The
la&s;t of the&s;e Opinions is mo&s;t generally receiv'd,
and wou'd &s;eem very probable, if it had produc'd
any advantageous Alteration in the Condition of
that unfortunate Prince; but there was not the
lea&s;t Motion made in Order to his Re&s;taurati|on.
<HI>Achmet</HI> was unanimou&s;ly elected, and his Ac|ce&s;&s;ion
to the Throne was attended with a cer|tain
Tranquillity that is rarely ob&s;erv'd in this
Country. The Misfortunes that happen'd in the Be|ginning
of his Reign &s;eem to be the Forerunners
and Pre&s;ages of future Di&s;a&s;ters; for before the fir&s;t
Month was expir'd, he lo&s;t that Great and Me|morable
Battle of <HI>Salankemen,</HI> of which I have

already given you an Account. And if I may be
allow'd to give Credit to the probable Conje|ctures
of tho&s;e who are be&s;t acquainted with the
Genius of his Subjects, I may venture to foretell
that he will never be an old Emperour, tho' he
is already in the <HI>Eight and fortieth</HI> Year of his
Age. For the <HI>Franks</HI> are po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with a le&s;s ad|vantageous
Opinion of him than of his Predece&s;|&s;or
<HI>Soliman,</HI> who&s;e Reign was neverthele&s;s di|&s;turb'd
with an almo&s;t perpetual Revolt that kept
his Throne continually in a tottering Condition.</P>
<P>The Death of the <HI>Vi&s;ier Kopergli,</HI> according to
the u&s;ual Cu&s;tom of this Country, was follow'd
with &s;everal Changes of Officers, and the Death
of many great Per&s;ons, among the re&s;t of one
<HI>Mu&s;tapha Aga,</HI> whom I knew at <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI>
He was born at <HI>Leghorn</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> and had
the Di&s;advantage to be de&s;cended of a Fa|mily
which had no con&s;iderable Fortune. He
was taken by the <HI>Turks</HI> at the Siege of <HI>Candy,</HI>
and renounc'd his Religion at the De&s;ire of the
<HI>Grand Vi&s;ier,</HI> who had a good Opinion of his A|bilities,
and re&s;olv'd to put him in a Way of
Bus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ne&s;s. He was ea&s;ily prevail'd with to em|brace
the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Faith; for &s;ince he was natural|ly
of an a&s;piring Temper, he enter'd with Joy
into the Service of a Man by who&s;e Intere&s;t he
might expect to rai&s;e his Fortune, and either
out of Gratitude, or Policy, he cho&s;e always to
depend on that Family. So that the late <HI>Vi&s;ier,
Kopergli Oglou,</HI> was his particular Patron, and ad|vanc'd
him to the <HI>Tophana,</HI> that is, the Found|ing
or Ca&s;ting of Metals, of which he was Di|rectour-General,
as well as of the Mint, which is
the mo&s;t gainful Po&s;t in the Empire. And be|&s;ides
he made a very con&s;iderable Addition to
the u&s;ual Profits of that Office, by inventing and
introducing a certain Copper Coin, call'd <HI>Man|gours:</HI>
<PB N="329" REF="187">
for each Piece was order'd to pa&s;s at the
Rate of &s;ix <HI>French Deniers,</HI> tho' 'twas no larger
than a <HI>Dutch Doit,</HI> or a &s;ingle <HI>French Denier;</HI> &s;o
that buying the Copper at <HI>twenty Pence</HI> a Pound, the
Profit amounted to <HI>Six</HI> in <HI>Seven.</HI> Not long af|ter
the Advancement of <HI>Kopergli Oglou, Mu&s;tapha</HI>
propos'd this Expedient to fill the Trea&s;ury,
which till this time was very empty; and
had Orders to coin Four thou&s;and <HI>Pur&s;es</HI> of
that Money, or Two millions of Crowns. So
prodigious a Quantity of tho&s;e Pieces cou'd not
but occa&s;ion great Di&s;orders, and a general In|terruption
of Trade; and be&s;ides tho&s;e that were
coin'd at the Mint, there came &s;everal Barks la|den
with 'em from <HI>France</HI> and <HI>The&s;&s;alonica,</HI> where
they were coin'd by the <HI>Jews,</HI> &s;o that there are
above Two hundred thou&s;and Crowns of Coun|terfeit
Money at pre&s;ent in the Empire. At la&s;t
People were &s;o di&s;courag'd at tho&s;e Abu&s;es, that
about three Months ago they began to refu&s;e to
take the&s;e Pieces for more than one half, and at
pre&s;ent they will not take 'em at all, notwith|&s;tanding
the repeated Orders of the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI>
who (as I intimated before) is not much re&s;pect|ed
in this Country. The Di&s;orders occa&s;ion'd by
the deba&s;ing of the Coin, and the va&s;t E&s;tate <HI>Mu&s;ta|pha
Aga</HI> had acquir'd, were the Cau&s;es of his Death.
His Enemies had long before begun to exclaim
again&s;t the Methods he took to oppre&s;s the Peo|ple;
pretending that he was a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> in his
Heart, and that he wou'd at la&s;t make his E|&s;cape
to <HI>Italy</HI> with all the Trea&s;ure he had &s;crap'd
together in the Empire, which certainly had been
the mo&s;t prudent Cour&s;e for a Man in his Cir|cum&s;tances.
But &s;ince the De&s;ire of Riches is like
the Thir&s;t of &s;ome di&s;eas'd Per&s;ons, which is en|creas'd
by Drinking, in&s;tead of heark'ning to the
Advice of his Friends, he took a quite contrary
<PB N="330" REF="188">
Method, and &s;ent for his Si&s;ter and Nephews,
thinking by that Means to vindicate him&s;elf from
the A&s;per&s;ions that were fix'd upon him by his
Adver&s;aries. Be&s;ides he plac'd an entire Confi|dence
in the <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier,</HI> and thought him&s;elf
ab&s;olutely &s;ecure under the Protection of &s;o kind
and powerful a Patron: but he ought to have
con&s;ider'd that his Patron was Mortal, and that
his Intere&s;t wou'd expire with his Life. 'Tis
plain by the Event, that he &s;hou'd have acted
more warily in &s;o dangerous a Po&s;t; for I have
ju&s;t now receiv'd a Letter which informs me that
he was &s;trangl'd, after they had given him
the Torture to make him di&s;cover his Money.
And he was even &s;o &s;trangely infatuated, that
tho' he was not apprehended for the Space of
Eight Days after the <HI>Vi&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">r</HI>'s Death, in&s;tead of
making his E&s;cape, he cho&s;e rather to expect his
Fate at his own Hou&s;e; where he was at la&s;t ar|re&s;ted
by the <HI>Caimacan,</HI> with his Wife, Si&s;ter, and
Nephews. The&s;e unfortunate Creatures, who have
not yet renounc'd the <HI>Catholic</HI> Religion, &s;ent to
beg <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Chateauneuf</HI>'s Protection for the
obtaining of their Liberty: but he is too much a
Politician to hazard his Intere&s;t at the Port to
pre&s;erve the Honour of his Religion.</P>
<P>They begin again to talk of Peace more than
ever; and I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">m inform'd that the <HI>Dutch</HI> Amba&s;|&s;adour

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have not forgot the Promi&s;e I made you at
the End of my la&s;t Letter; but I know not
if you will thank me for keeping my Word,
&s;ince in&s;tead of the News I hop'd to &s;end you,
I mu&s;t acquaint you that the Negotiations for a
Peace are at an End, or rather interrupted for
&s;ome time; for 'tis &s;o much the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s
Int're&s;t to conclude a Treaty, that without pre|tending
to the Spirit of Prophe&s;ie, I may venture
to foretel that it will be renew'd. In the mean
time it will not be improper to give you an Ac|count
of this unexpected Accident. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
and <HI>Dutch</HI> Amba&s;&s;adors arriv'd at <HI>Adrianople</HI> in the
Beginning of the la&s;t Month, and had &s;everal
Conferences with the <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier,</HI> in which the
greate&s;t part of the Articles were mutually agreed
on; and the only Difficulty that ob&s;tructed the
happy Conclu&s;ion of the Treaty, was the <HI>Vi&s;ier</HI>'s
in&s;i&s;ting upon the Re&s;toring of <HI>Buda,</HI> and the keep|ing
of <HI>Caminiec,</HI> concerning which they expected
In&s;tructions from the Emperor. While Affairs
were in this Po&s;ture, the Plague began to rage &s;o
violently at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> that the Amba&s;&s;adors thought
<PB N="332" REF="189">
fit to retire to a Vilage two Leagues on this &s;ide
the Town, till the Fury of the Di&s;temper &s;hou'd
be &s;omewhat abated. But the Baron <HI>de Chateau|neuf</HI>
having receiv'd new In&s;tructions, which in all
probability were accompany'd with &s;ome weigh|ty
Propo&s;als, came to <HI>Adrianople,</HI> tho' he was nei|ther
&s;ent for nor expected; and without the lea&s;t
Regard to the pre&s;ervation of his Life, he had the
Courage to brave Death in the mid&s;t of a City
where &s;he &s;eem'd to have fix'd the Seat of her
Empire; for the Plague made &s;o terrible a Havock,
that there died above a Thou&s;and Per&s;ons a Day.
At the &s;ame time it happen'd that Sir <HI>William Hu&s;&s;y</HI>
was in a Gallery, and perceiving a Company of
Men in the Plain, he had the Curio&s;ity to &s;end one
of his Servants to inquire who they were. As &s;oon
as he heard that 'twas the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, he
began to dread the Con&s;equences of that Mini|&s;ter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s
Journey; for he con&s;ider'd that he wou'd ne|ver
have expos'd him&s;elf to &s;o imminent a Danger,
and even without being call'd, if there had not
been &s;ome hidden and extraordinary De&s;ign in
Agitation. 'Tis thought that the <HI>French</HI> King be|ing
inform'd of the great Progre&s;s that was made
in the Treaty, &s;ent In&s;tructions to his Amba&s;&s;a|dor,
impowering him to conclude a &s;ecret Alliance
with the <HI>Turks;</HI> and 'tis but too plain that the&s;e are
more than bare Conjectures; for the <HI>Vi&s;ier</HI> wou'd
never afterwards hear the lea&s;t Word of a Peace.
However, 'tis certain that Sir <HI>William Hu&s;&s;ey</HI>'s Vexation
at &s;o unexpected a Di&s;appointment, contributed
not a little to his Death; for you mu&s;t not give
credit to the Surmi&s;es of tho&s;e who pretend that
he was poy&s;on'd, &s;ince there was not the lea&s;t
Mark of Poy&s;on found in his Body, which was
open'd by his own Chirurgeon, in the pre&s;ence of
his Chaplain, Secretary, and the re&s;t of his Dome|&s;tick
Servants. But tho' in all probability the
<PB N="333" REF="189">
<HI>French</HI> had no hand in this Gentleman's Death,
I dare not pronounce 'em guiltle&s;s of the Attempt
that was made upon Count <HI>Mar&s;igli,</HI> who was a&s;|&s;aulted
near <HI>Belgrade,</HI> in his return from <HI>Vienna</HI> with
his <HI>Imperial Maje&s;ty's</HI> An&s;wer. His <HI>Chiaoux,</HI> and two
of his Servants, were kill'd upon the Spot, and
he was wounded in five places both with Sa|bres
and Pi&s;tols: But before they had time to di|&s;patch
him, the Prince of <HI>Moldavia</HI> came &s;ea&s;ona|bly
to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, tho' he cou'd not &s;eize the
Murderers, becau&s;e they fled as &s;oon as they per|ceiv'd
him. All the&s;e Circum&s;tances, and the Jun|cture
of the Time, make me very inclinable to
believe that this Attempt was not made without
a particular Order. I took Occa&s;ion Ye&s;terday to
di&s;cour&s;e concerning this Accident with the <HI>Con|&s;ul
de Hochepied,</HI> who&s;e Vertue makes him &s;o inca|pable
of Su&s;picion, that he cannot believe the
<HI>French</HI> wou'd be guilty of &s;o Barbarous an Action;
and be&s;ides, he is per&s;uaded that the Murderers
wou'd have &s;eiz'd on the Count's Papers, if they
had been &s;et on by the <HI>French.</HI> But in my Opi|nion
that Circum&s;tance ought not to be alleg'd
as an Argument in their Vindication; for the &s;ei|zing
of the Papers wou'd have plainly di&s;cover'd the
Authors of the Murder; and we may rea&s;onably
&s;uppo&s;e, that tho' the <HI>French</HI> King takes no care
to conceal the boundle&s;ne&s;s of his Ambition, he
wou'd be loath to be reckon'd an Abettor of Mur|derers.
And be&s;ides, he might well di&s;pen&s;e with
a Sight of the Emperor's Orders and Count <HI>Mar|&s;igli</HI>'s
In&s;tructions, &s;ince he entertains &s;o many Spies
at the <HI>Port,</HI> who make it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to di&s;co|ver
the mo&s;t &s;ecret Tran&s;actions, and had in all
probability acquainted him with every thing that
related to the Negotiation. Thus Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> has
had the Misfortune to &s;ee all his Hopes unexpect|edly
bla&s;ted; and we may rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e that
<PB N="334" REF="190">
his Vexation is con&s;iderably heighten'd by the im|po&s;&s;ibility
of regaining his Ground: For Money is
the prevailing Argument at the <HI>Port,</HI> and the in|fallible
Rule by which all Controver&s;ies are deci|ded.
I cannot better repre&s;ent the Genius of the
<HI>Aga's, Ba&s;&s;a's,</HI> that <HI>Vi&s;iers</HI> that compo&s;e this Court,
than by comparing 'em to a Company of Mer|chants,
who wou'd &s;ell the very State if they
cou'd, to the highe&s;t Bidder. And the &s;ame Cha|racter
may be univer&s;ally apply'd to private Per&s;ons;
for Int're&s;t is the Idol to which they &s;acrifice their
Quiet, Honour, Emperor, and even the Empire it
&s;elf. This is the fatal Source of all tho&s;e terrible
Di&s;orders and Revolutions, of which we find &s;o
many In&s;tances in Hi&s;tory, that wou'd &s;eem alto|gether
incredible if almo&s;t every Day did not
furni&s;h us with fre&s;h Examples of 'em.</P>
<P>There is at pre&s;ent in this Place one of Count
<HI>Tekely</HI>'s Relations, who came lately from <HI>France;</HI>
and 'tis ob&s;ervable, that he was not at all &s;ur|priz'd
at the News of the un&s;ucce&s;sful Conclu&s;ion
of the Treaty, which makes us believe that he ex|pected
&s;o &s;udden a Change, and was not ignorant
of the Cau&s;es of it. He lodges at the <HI>Con&s;ul</HI>'s
Hou&s;e, and is ju&s;t ready to depart for <HI>Con&s;tantino|ple,</HI>
where 'tis &s;aid he intends to lodge with <HI>Mon|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ieur
Chateauneuf.</HI> I know not what Treatment he
expects from the Amba&s;&s;ador, but I'm apt to be|lieve
he will not meet with a very Ceremonious
Reception: For when the Count him&s;elf paid a
Vi&s;it to the Amba&s;&s;ador at <HI>Sophia,</HI> he receiv'd
him in his Bed, and pretended a Fit of Sickne&s;s,
to avoid the Ceremony of a formal Reception;
for there were &s;ome Rea&s;ons that inclin'd him to
receive the Count as Prince of <HI>Tran&s;ilvania,</HI> as
there were others that oblig'd him to treat him
only as Count <HI>Tekely.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="335" REF="191">
I had Occa&s;ion this very Day to &s;ee the Tri|umphant
Proce&s;&s;ion of a <HI>Genoe&s;e</HI> Renegado, who
came hither in a Ship belonging to <HI>Provence.</HI> Since
the <HI>Cadi's</HI> are oblig'd by the Chartel not to re|ceive

he did not know the Man, nor was at all con|cern'd

Cavalcade was to pa&s;s by his Gate, he &s;ent Word

and order the Renegado to be &s;eiz'd in the mid&s;t
of his Triumph, and cha&s;tis'd with five hundred
<HI>Ba&s;tonado's.</HI> Neverthele&s;s he was &s;o far from en|deavouring
to execute his Menaces, that he &s;uf|fer'd
the whole Proce&s;&s;ion to pa&s;s under his Win|dows
without making the lea&s;t Attempt to di&s;turb
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">em. I &s;hall take this Occa&s;ion to give you a
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">ief Account of the Ceremonies that are us'd
when a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> intends to abjure his Religion.
Fir&s;t they in&s;truct him in the Principles of the
<HI>Mahometan</HI> Religion, and after a whole Month
&s;pent in that Exerci&s;e, they gather a Contributi|on
to buy a Sute of Clothes for him, which &s;ome|times
amounts to fifty Crowns, but rarely exceeds
that Summ; and they commonly u&s;e Force when
People are not willing to contribute out of Cha|rity.
Then the Renegado is carry'd before the
<HI>Cadi,</HI> in who&s;e Pre&s;ence, and of two <HI>Effendi's,</HI>
and &s;everal other Per&s;ons, he makes a public Pro|fe&s;&s;ion
of his Faith with the following Ceremo|nies.
Fir&s;t an <HI>I&s;man</HI> makes him perform the <HI>Goul,</HI>
<PB N="336" REF="192">
which is their mo&s;t Solemn Ablution, and as he
begins to wa&s;h him&s;elf, he pronounces the&s;e Words,
<HI>bis millah el azem ve ellem doullillah allah din is lam; In
the Name of the Great God, Glory be to God, the God of the
Mu&s;ulman Faith.</HI> Then the <HI>I&s;man</HI> him&s;elf performs
the <HI>Goul,</HI> for they reckon them&s;elves polluted by
touching a <HI>Chri&s;tian;</HI> after which they both put
on their Clothes, and come before the <HI>Cadi,</HI> who
&s;ays to the Renegado, <HI>Art thou willing to turn Mu|&s;ulman.</HI>
After he has reply'd, <HI>Yes,</HI> the <HI>I&s;man</HI> takes
the <HI>Alcoran</HI> in both his Hands, and holding it a|bove
the <HI>Chri&s;tian's</HI> Head, he &s;ays fir&s;t <HI>bis millah, in
the Name of God;</HI> then addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the
<HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> he proceeds thus; <HI>Allah ecber, allah ecber,
allah ecber, e&s;chad in la illah, illallah, e&s;chad in Mebe|met
re&s;oul allah;</HI> which are almo&s;t the &s;ame Words
that are proclaim'd by the <HI>Muezins</HI> from the <HI>Mi|narets</HI>
or Steeples of the <HI>Mo&s;quees.</HI> The Renegado
replies, <HI>Illah, illallah Mehemet re&s;oul allah; There is no
other God, and Mahomet is his great Prophet;</HI> and as
&s;oon as he has made a public Profe&s;&s;ion of his
Faith by pronouncing the&s;e Words, they put a
<HI>Turbant</HI> on his Head, and make him ki&s;s the <HI>Al|coran,</HI>
which he cou'd not do before without a
Crime. Then they embrace and care&s;s him, and
put all things in order for the Cavalcade, having
already provided two or three Hundred Men,
arm'd with Sabres, Carabines, and Pi&s;tols, with &s;ix
En&s;igns, two of which march before, and the o|ther
four &s;urround the Renegado, who is almo&s;t
entirely cover'd by 'em. He is mounted on a fine
Hor&s;e, which the <HI>Cadi</HI> lends him, adorn'd with a
rich Ve&s;t, which he wears all the re&s;t of the Day.
The Soldiers march four in a Rank, expre&s;&s;ing their
Joy by loud Shouts and repeated Volleys of Shot,
the Renegado walking in the mid&s;t of 'em with
the En&s;igns. Thus they march in a Triumphant
manner thro' the City; but all this Pomp is but
<PB N="337" REF="192">
an Introduction to the Scene of Pain, for as &s;oon
as the Triumph is over, they proceed to Cir|cumci&s;ion,
which is thus perform'd: They draw
their Prepuce over the Glans or Nut of the
Yard, and pre&s;&s;ing it between two little Pieces of
Iron, they cut off with a Razor that part of the
Fore-Skin which reaches beyond the Glans, and
at that very Moment the Apo&s;tate mu&s;t once
more repeat the&s;e Words, <HI>la illah illallah, Mehemet
re&s;oul allah.</HI> After this Ceremony, the new <HI>Mu&s;ul|man</HI>
mu&s;t keep his Bed fifteen Days; for the Cure
of the Wound is rarely compleated &s;ooner; after
which he may chu&s;e what Imployment he plea|&s;es;
that is, he may either Li&s;t him&s;elf in the Ar|my,
or enter into Service, tho' &s;uch Per&s;ons u&s;u|ally
become extremely mi&s;erable. For there is no|thing
more common than to &s;ee a Renegado
begging; and the <HI>Turks</HI> are &s;o far from relieving
'em in their Di&s;tre&s;s, that the very Name of a
<HI>Renegado</HI> is &s;ufficient to make tho&s;e who bear it hated
and de&s;pis'd, not only by the <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> who look up|on
'em as ba&s;e and cowardly Apo&s;tates, but even
by the <HI>Turks,</HI> who can never be per&s;uaded by all
their &s;eeming Devotion that they are &s;incere Pro|fe&s;&s;ors
of the <HI>Mu&s;ulman</HI> Faith.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, I have at la&s;t fini&s;h'd the Account

have &s;atisfy'd my Curio&s;ity with a View of
a very con&s;iderable Rarity, I mean the Bones of
a Giant that were found by &s;ome Work-men in
<PB N="338" REF="193">
that Place, as they were digging the Foundations
of a Hou&s;e for the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a.</HI> All the Chirurgeons
of the Country have examin'd 'em, and have gi|ven
in a formal Atte&s;tation in which they con|clude
that the&s;e are the real Bones of a Man,
who&s;e Height, according to their Computation,
amounted to above Twenty Feet; &s;o that this
may be look'd upon as a Confirmation of the Sto|ry
of the Giant at <HI>Spire</HI> in <HI>Germany.</HI> But I mu&s;t
e'en content my &s;elf with the Accounts I have
heard of that Curio&s;ity, &s;ince our Captain intends
not to touch at that Place. I &s;hall have the good
Fortune during our Voyage to have the Conver&s;ati|on
of one <HI>Signior Stephano,</HI> an <HI>Italian</HI> Engineer, who
having &s;pent Eight or Ten Years in the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI>
Service, is not willing to continue longer in &s;o
dangerous a Po&s;t. He is an ingenious and witty
Per&s;on, and will doubtle&s;s prove a very agreeable
Companion: Be&s;ides, he intends to carry his
Wife along with him, who is a little <HI>Greek,</HI> about
Eighteen Years old, and the prettye&s;t Creature in
the World; &s;o that I hope to pa&s;s the&s;e Seas with
more Plea&s;ure than I did before.</P>
<P>We have ju&s;t now receiv'd the good News of
Count <HI>Mar&s;igli's</HI> Recovery, with which I &s;hall
conclude this Letter. I have already told you that
he was very dangerou&s;ly wounded, and am glad I
can now inform you that the Vigour of his Con|&s;titution,
and the Care of his Phy&s;icians, have hap|pily
re&s;tor'd him to his Health. If the Malice of
his Enemies had &s;ucceeded according to their De|&s;ire,
the Emperor wou'd have had rea&s;on to
bewail the Lo&s;s of a Man who is very well fit|ted
for the Management of important Negotiati|ons.
He was born at <HI>Pi&s;a</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> and is de&s;cen|ded
of a very con&s;iderable Family; but has not
yet been dignify'd with any other Character than
that of Secratary to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Emba&s;&s;y; tho'
<PB N="339" REF="193">
he is really a &s;ecret Envoy from the Emperor,
and only a&s;&s;umes the other Title that he may with
more Security negotiate his Ma&s;ter's Affairs. But
if the Peace were concluded, he wou'd certainly
be rewarded with a higher Po&s;t.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>OUR pre&s;ent Confinement puts me in mind of
the eager Impatience of a <HI>Lover</HI> who <HI>&s;ees,</HI> but
dares not <HI>approach</HI> his <HI>Mi&s;tre&s;s.</HI> For here we mu&s;t
lie in the <HI>Lazaretto,</HI> and content our &s;elves with
making Court to the <HI>Signora Venetia Bella,</HI> without
the lea&s;t hope of enjoying her Beauties, till we
have purchas'd the Charming Delight at the rate
of Forty Days &s;ighing and whining. We are de|tain'd
here by an Order from the <HI>Tribunal of Health,</HI>
lea&s;t we &s;hou'd &s;pread &s;ome Infectious Di&s;temper;
and I among the re&s;t am forc'd to bear this un|ea&s;ie
Re&s;traint, tho' I'm at pre&s;ent in as perfect
Health as any of the&s;e Cautious Gentlemen. But
perhaps you'll be more inqui&s;itive to know how
we came hither, than how we &s;pend our Time
here; and therefore I &s;hall proceed to give you a
&s;hort Account of our Voyage.</P>
<P>I left <HI>Smyrna</HI> &s;ome Days after the writing of
my la&s;t Letter, not without a very &s;en&s;ible Affli|ction
at my taking leave of Mon&s;ieur and Madam
<PB N="340" REF="194">
<HI>de Hochepied,</HI> from whom I had receiv'd &s;o ma|ny
Favours and Civilities during my abode in
their Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Our Voyage was di&s;turb'd by an almo&s;t perpetu|al
Storm, which redoubling its Fury from Day to
Day, made us conclude more than once that we
&s;hou'd certainly be bury'd in the Waves. Poor
<HI>Signior Stephano,</HI> whom I mention'd in my la&s;t,
fell &s;ick two Days after he embark'd, and being
unable to bear the tempe&s;tuous Working of the
Sea, dy'd Eight Days after. The Super&s;tition of
our Ship's Crew furni&s;h'd us with a very plea|&s;ant
Scene; for they unanimou&s;ly concluded him
to be a Sorcerer, becau&s;e they had &s;een him draw
&s;ome Mathematical Figures during the fir&s;t two
Days of our Voyage, and were ab&s;olutely confirm'd
in that Opinion by a curious Mechanical Experi|ment
he happen'd to try in their pre&s;ence, by
lifting up a very con&s;iderable Weight with one
Hand, which tho&s;e thick-skull'd Animals thought
impo&s;&s;ible to be perform'd without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance
of <HI>Magic.</HI> This ridiculous Conceit made &s;o &s;trong
an Impre&s;&s;ion upon upon 'em, that they &s;lighted
all the Arguments and A&s;&s;everations I cou'd u&s;e to
undeceive 'em, and not only per&s;i&s;t in their Belief
of <HI>Signior Stephano's</HI> Skill in the Diabolioal Art, but
impute all the bad Weather to his Conjurations&punc;
The Captain pretends to be of the &s;ame Opinion,
tho' I know not how to reconcile his Complai|&s;ance
to the young Widow to the Sentiments he
&s;eems to have of her Husband; For he obliges her
to perform her <HI>Quarantain</HI> on Board his Ship, and
re&s;olves to make her his Wife.</P>
<P>The Storm forc'd us to &s;tand in to a Canal
between two little I&s;lands, call'd <HI>Millo</HI> and <HI>Argen|tiere.</HI>
The fir&s;t is Forty Miles in Compa&s;s, and
the whole Country is Mountainous, except a plea|&s;ant
and fertil Plain, &s;ix or &s;even Miles long, in
<PB N="341" REF="194">
the mid&s;t of which &s;tands the City of <HI>Millo,</HI> con|taining
about Twenty narrow Streets. The In|habitants
are generally <HI>Greeks;</HI> but there are al&s;o
3 or 400 Souls of the <HI>Latin</HI> Church, who have
their Bi&s;hop and Cathedral. The <HI>Venetians</HI> main|tain
a <HI>Pode&s;tat</HI> in the I&s;land to gather the Tribute;
but there is no Garri&s;on kept in it, tho' it receives
frequent Vi&s;its from the <HI>Turks;</HI> &s;o that the fir&s;t
<HI>Cor&s;air</HI> who comes with a numerous Company, is
King of the I&s;land &s;o long as he plea&s;es to re&s;ide
it it. Yet the Pyrates never commit any di&s;or|ders
in this place, by rea&s;on of the A&s;&s;i&s;tance they
receive from the Merchants that live here, who
furni&s;h 'em with Commodities to be paid out of
the next Prize that falls into their Hands. There
is a <HI>French</HI> Ordinary in the Town, where one may
find pretty good Entertainment: And I remember
I &s;aw a Man there of &s;o free and open a Di&s;po|&s;ition,
that I &s;hou'd have thought him a Rarity
in that Country, if I had not been told that all
the&s;e I&s;landers are generally of that Humour. He
took occa&s;ion to Di&s;cour&s;e of a Maid who was
his Wife's Daughter, and declar'd that he wou'd
willingly di&s;po&s;e of her to a Husband. One who
was pre&s;ent lik'd the Propo&s;al, and told him that
he wou'd ea&s;e him of the Burden if he pleas'd to
be&s;tow her upon him. <HI>With all my Heart,</HI> reply'd
the Father: <HI>Then,</HI> &s;aid the other, <HI>I de&s;ire to know
what you are willing to give with her. What d'ye
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ean,</HI> reply'd the old Gentleman, <HI>Give with her,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">oth' a; Why, I wont give her &s;elf for nothing. You
mo&s;t take me for a &s;illy Coxcomb indeed, if you think I'll
give you a pretty lively Girl, and hire you to take her?
No, I beg your pardon, 'tis you mu&s;t give the Money:
And if I can find none that will take my Daughter on the&s;e
Terms, I'll e'en keep her, and make u&s;e of her my
&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="342" REF="195">
The Women are &s;o accu&s;tom'd to the Conver&s;e
of the Pyrates, that they are generally very liberal
of their Favours, but not quite &s;o frank as their
Neighbours of <HI>Argentiere,</HI> which is another little
I&s;land, about Twenty Miles in Compa&s;s, contain|ing
only a little Town and a Village, both inha|bited
by about Five hundred Women; for there is
not a Man in the I&s;land, except Seven or Eight
<HI>Papa's,</HI> who perform <HI>Divine Service.</HI> The&s;e Wo|men
have no Trade to maintain 'em, but live
purely on the Work of Nature; &s;o that all the
Merchants and Cor&s;airs, who come to the I&s;land,
chu&s;e a Female-Companion, either fair or brown,
according to every Man's particular Fancy. The
Children are left to the Di&s;po&s;al of the Women;
the Girls grow up and work to maintain their Mo|thers;
but a&s;&s;oon as the Boys are Twelve Years
old, they are put on Board the fir&s;t Ve&s;&s;el that
touches at the I&s;land.</P>
<P>From thence we continu'd our Voyage to <HI>Zant,</HI>
a con&s;iderable I&s;land belonging to the <HI>Venetians.</HI> It
contains a hundred Miles in Compa&s;s, and produ|ces
great Store of delicious Wines, both <HI>Mu&s;cadin</HI>
and other Sorts. But &s;ince <HI>Italy</HI> is &s;ufficiently
&s;tock'd with the&s;e Commodities, the Inhabitants
of this I&s;land dry mo&s;t of their Grapes, and
&s;end 'em to <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland.</HI> Both the City
and Harbour are commanded by a very fine Ca|&s;tle,
where the Proveditore, who is always cho|&s;en
out of the Principal Nobility, re&s;ides. The
Inhabitants are Rich, and there are &s;everal Gen|tlemen
among 'em. This is the fir&s;t place as you
come from the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> where you meet with
People cloath'd after the manner of the <HI>Franks;</HI>
yet many of 'em wear a <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Ve&s;t above their
other Cloaths. The <HI>Venetians</HI> have built &s;everal
Churches for the U&s;e of tho&s;e who profe&s;s the
<HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Faith; and do what they can to e&s;tabli&s;h
<PB N="343" REF="195">
that Religion, in Oppo&s;ition to that of the <HI>Greeks,</HI>
which is the Religion of the Natives. The City
is long and narrow; which is all the Account I
can give you of it, for tho&s;e who come from the
<HI>Levant</HI> are not &s;uffer'd to go a-&s;hore till they
have perform'd their <HI>Quarantain.</HI> The Prince of
<HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> who &s;erves in the Army of the Re|publick,
pa&s;s'd the whole la&s;t Winter in this place;
and gain'd the Love of the Inhabitants to &s;uch a
Degree, that there is not a Man of 'em who
wou'd not &s;acrifice him&s;elf for his Sake. I heard
a Story of that Prince, which I'm confident will
give you &s;ome Diver&s;ion. He fell in Love with
a very Beautiful Courtezan, who treated him with
an extraordinary Coyne&s;s; either becau&s;e &s;he had
a particular Aver&s;ion to him, or (which is the
more probable Rea&s;on of the two) becau&s;e &s;he
thought he was very deeply engag'd, and inten|ded
to make him pay dear for a Favour which
he de&s;ir'd with &s;o much Ardour. But whatever
was the true Cau&s;e of her Rigour, the Prince
per&s;i&s;ted in his un&s;ucce&s;sful Court&s;hip; but his Pati|ence
being at la&s;t exhau&s;ted, he re&s;olv'd upon a
Stratagem to &s;atisfie at once both his Love and
Revenge: There are in <HI>Zant</HI> certain Porters call'd
<HI>Ce&s;tariols,</HI> who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s is to carry home the
Provi&s;ions that are bought by the Citizens at the
Market. The irritated Prince procur'd a <HI>Ce&s;ta|riol's</HI>
Habit, which di&s;guis'd him &s;o well that he had
no Rea&s;on to fear a Di&s;covery. In that Dre&s;s
he went to the Courtezan's Waiting-Maid, and
told her, that he was &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately in Love with
her Mi&s;tre&s;s, that he &s;hou'd certainly lo&s;e his Rea|&s;on
if &s;he wou'd not &s;uffer her &s;elf to be touch'd
with a compa&s;&s;ionate Sen&s;e of his Sufferings. And
to engage the Maid to employ her Intere&s;t in his
Favour, he pre&s;ented her with Ten <HI>Sequins,</HI> which
amount to about Five and twenty Crowns; and
<PB N="344" REF="196">
a&s;&s;ur'd her that if by her A&s;&s;i&s;tance he cou'd pro|cure
one Night's Plea&s;ure, he wou'd give her as
many <HI>Sequins</HI> more, and wou'd be&s;ides reward the
<HI>Signora</HI> &s;o liberally, that &s;he &s;hou'd never have
Rea&s;on to repent her Conde&s;cen&s;ion to him. The
Maid was extremely &s;urpriz'd at the <HI>Ce&s;tariol</HI>'s Boun|ty:
however &s;he forgot not to deliver his Me&s;&s;age to
her Mi&s;tre&s;s, who &s;eem'd to receive it very cold|ly;
for &s;he thought &s;uch an Action wou'd make
her be look'd upon as a common Pro&s;titute. But
the Maid, who perhaps was not &s;o &s;crupulous,
and had &s;o con&s;iderable an Intere&s;t in the Suc|ce&s;s
of this Affair, us'd all the Arguments &s;he
cou'd invent, to per&s;wade her Mi&s;tre&s;s to a Com|pliance,
and concluded her Exhortations with this
wi&s;e and prevailing Remark, That a <HI>Ce&s;tariol</HI> with
a full Pur&s;e wou'd prove a better Cu&s;tomer than
a <HI>Proveditore</HI> with an empty one; adding, that the
Mi&s;tre&s;s might expect a very Noble Acknowledg|ment
from one that had been &s;o liberal to the
Maid. The&s;e &s;age Remon&s;trances had &s;o good an
Effect, that the <HI>Ce&s;tariol</HI> was introduc'd in the E|vening
to the <HI>Signora</HI>'s Chamber, where he quick|ly
&s;torm'd the Place that had &s;o long with|&s;tood
his Attacks. 'Twou'd be as needle&s;s to give
you a more particular Account of his Night's
Work, as it wou'd be to repre&s;ent the Confu&s;ion
and A&s;toni&s;ment that &s;eiz'd the Fair One in the
Morning, when &s;he &s;aw her Chamber full of Ser|vants
that came to dre&s;s her Bed-fellow, and found
that the pretended <HI>Ce&s;tariol</HI> was transform'd into the
Prince of <HI>Brun&s;wick.</HI> However &s;he endeavour'd to
&s;et the be&s;t Face &s;he cou'd on &s;o cro&s;s an Adventure,
and comforted her &s;elf with the Expectation of a
magnificent Reward. But &s;he cou'd no longer con|ceal
the Di&s;compo&s;ure of her Mind, when in&s;tead
of a Handful of <HI>Sequins</HI> the Prince pre&s;ented her
with <HI>Three-pence,</HI> adding, That <HI>if &s;he had entertain'd
<PB N="345" REF="196">
him as a Prince, he wou'd have paid her as a Prince;
but &s;ince &s;he had only treated him as a Porter, &s;he mu&s;t
content her &s;elf with Porter's Wages.</HI></P>
<P>Departing from <HI>Zant,</HI> we left <HI>Corfou</HI> on our Left-hand,
and enter'd the Gulf, at the Mouth of which
we lo&s;t our Long-Boat in a Storm. The Fury of
the Tempe&s;t being &s;omewhat abated, we conti|nu'd
our Cour&s;e with a Side-Wind, and about Mid|night
perceiv'd, by the Light of the Moon, a Sail,
which pa&s;s'd very near our Ship without haling us. But
&s;he had &s;carce left us half a Mile when &s;he tack'd
about, and bore down upon us with full Sails; and
&s;ince &s;he was lighter than our Ve&s;&s;el, &s;he quickly
came up with us. Our Captain concluding that
&s;he de&s;ign'd to attack us, commanded every Man
to his Po&s;t, and put all things in a Readine&s;s for
an Engagement, &s;wearing that he wou'd fire at her,
if &s;he came nearer. Some of the Seamen endea|vour'd
to per&s;wade him that a Cor&s;air wou'd hard|ly
venture to cruize in the Gulf; and that if the
Ve&s;&s;el we fear'd had had &s;uch a De&s;ign, &s;he wou'd
have either fir'd at us, or boarded us as &s;he pa&s;s'd
by. But he continu'd fix'd in his Re&s;olution, tel|ling
'em that he plac'd more Confidence in his
Guns than in their Arguments; and that if the
Captain did not know his own Bu&s;ine&s;s, he wou'd
endeavour to in&s;truct him. And indeed he kept
his Word, for a&s;&s;oon as cou'd have a full Aim
to point his Guns at her Side, he gave her a
Broad-&s;ide, and tacking about, rak'd her fore and
aft: but it &s;eems &s;he was better acquainted with
the Rules of Good-breeding than we expected, for
&s;he quickly return'd our Compliment with the &s;ame
Ceremonies, and then bore away. Our Cabbin
was pierc'd with a Shot, which was all the Dam|mage
we receiv'd, except the breaking of a Bar|rel
of excellent Wine, which I had provided
<PB N="346" REF="197">
at <HI>Zant</HI> for my own U&s;e, during the <HI>Quaran|tain.</HI></P>
<P>Two Days after we made the Height of <HI>Ragu|&s;a,</HI>
which is a con&s;iderable City &s;eated on the
Sea-&s;ide; Toward the Sea 'tis defended by a &s;trong
Cittadel, and on the other Side by a high and in|acce&s;&s;ible
Mountain. Its Figure is almo&s;t round,
and its Circuit exceeds not two Miles. The Hou|&s;es
are generally pretty well built; but there are
none that de&s;erve a particular Ob&s;ervation. The
Government is <HI>Ari&s;tocratical,</HI> not much different
from that of <HI>Venice,</HI> only its Weakne&s;s makes it
act more cautiou&s;ly for the Pre&s;ervation of its Li|berty.
The Senate is compos'd of Gentlemen and
a <HI>Doge:</HI> but this Dignity in&s;tead of continuing for
Life, as at <HI>Venice,</HI> la&s;ts but a Month, after which a
New <HI>Doge</HI> is Elected with &s;o little Intriguing, that
oftentimes a Gentleman walking in the Public
Place, is &s;urpriz'd with the News of his Electi|on.
During the time of his Government he is
&s;erv'd and entertain'd at the Public Charge, after
which he returns home to dre&s;s his Garden. Since
the Government of the Ca&s;tle is a more impor|tant
Office, and the Ill-management of it might prove
more fatal to the Republic, it la&s;ts not &s;o long as
the former: for a New Governour is cho&s;en every
Night, and oblig'd to remain in the Ca&s;tle till his
Succe&s;&s;our come to relieve him. So that the No|bles
reckon this Commi&s;&s;ion rather a Trouble than
an Honour; and wou'd be as glad to be exempted
from it, as a Captain wou'd be pleas'd to be excus'd
from mounting the Guard. The Garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ts of
Two hundred Men, and be&s;ides the Burgers are
oblig'd to keep Guard with 'em. The Gentle|men
are exempted from that Trouble, but they
mu&s;t not lie one Night out of the City without
a &s;pecial Permi&s;&s;ion. S. <HI>Blai&s;e</HI> is the Patron of
<HI>Ragu&s;a,</HI> as S. <HI>Mark</HI> is of <HI>Venice:</HI> and is painted on
<PB N="347" REF="197">
their Banners and En&s;igns, and wherever 'tis the
Cu&s;tom to place the Arms of the Republic. A
Mile from the Town towards the Mouth of the
Gulf, &s;tands the ancient City of <HI>Ragu&s;a,</HI> which at
pre&s;ent is call'd <HI>Ragu&s;a Vecchio.</HI> 'Tis inhabited by
&s;ome poor People, and &s;eems rather to be a Village
than a City. The whole Territory of <HI>Ragu&s;a</HI> ex|tends
not Thirty Miles round the City, and at
Sea they are only po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of the I&s;land of <HI>Au|gu&s;ta.</HI>
This little Republic makes a great Noi&s;e
with a certain imaginary Liberty, of which the
<HI>Ragu&s;ans</HI> are extremely fond, tho' really they are
not Ma&s;ters of them&s;elves; for they are ab&s;olute|ly
commanded by the <HI>Venetians,</HI> and mu&s;t do what
whatever they plea&s;e. The <HI>Turk</HI> and Emperour
content them&s;elves with a moderate Tribute, with|out
medling with the Affairs of the Republic; but
if the Payment be delay'd, the <HI>Ragu&s;ans</HI> run the
the Hazard of paying dear for their Neglect. And
be&s;ides they are on &s;everal Occa&s;ions in&s;ulted over
by the <HI>French</HI> King, and other <HI>European</HI> Princes;
and mu&s;t tamely &s;uffer the greate&s;t Abu&s;es, without
daring to repine at the Hand which oppre&s;&s;es 'em.
I have all along ob&s;erv'd, during the whole Cour&s;e
of my Travels, that one may find every-where
fre&s;h In&s;tances of the Folly and Weakne&s;s of
human Nature: and the very Sight of this Place is
&s;ufficient to put a Man in mind of that Reflexi|on.
For 'tis certain that the Liberty or Inde|pendency
of the <HI>Ragu&s;ans,</HI> as well as of &s;everal
other States, is their greate&s;t Misfortune; and
that they wou'd be infinitely more happy under
the Dominion of &s;ome potent Ma&s;ter, that cou'd
protect 'em from all the Injuries and Affronts
which they are daily oblig'd to &s;uffer without the
lea&s;t Hope of Redre&s;s. And I'm confident, if you
con&s;ider, without Prejudice, the Advantages on
both &s;ides, you will conclude with me, That, not|with&s;tanding
<PB N="348" REF="198">
their boa&s;ted Liberty, a Wi&s;e Man
wou'd rather chu&s;e to be a Subject of <HI>Venice,</HI>
than to be a Free Citizen of <HI>Ragu&s;a.</HI> But to return to
my Voyage.</P>
<P>The Wind coming fair, we left <HI>Ragu&s;a,</HI> and the
next Morning we came to an Anchor in the
Harbour of the little City <HI>Parenzo</HI> in <HI>I&s;tria,</HI> where
we took a Pilot. For the Republick keeps always
a &s;ufficient Number of Pilots in this place, for
the Conveniency of Ships that are bound for
<HI>Venice;</HI> which are oblig'd to have Recour&s;e to
their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, becau&s;e from thence to the <HI>La|gunes</HI>
the Pa&s;&s;age is extremely hazardous, by rea|&s;on
of the Banks of Sand that are form'd by the
Rivers <HI>Po</HI> and <HI>Brent</HI> at their Falling into the Sea.
The&s;e Banks are &s;o dangerous, and &s;ubject to &s;o
frequent Alterations, that the mo&s;t skilful Pilots,
who are acquainted with every Rock and Shoal in
the Pa&s;&s;age, are forc'd to &s;teer perpetually with
a Line in their Hand, for fear of &s;ome fatal
Blunder, which wou'd certainly be puni&s;h'd with
Death. The Difficulty of the Pa&s;&s;age is a very
con&s;iderable Di&s;advantage and Ob&s;truction to Trade;
but it may be reckon'd the main Security of <HI>Ve|nice,</HI>
which cannot be attack'd on that Side. For
tho' a Fleet of Ships &s;hou'd be conducted to <HI>Mala|moca</HI>
by <HI>Venetian</HI> Pilots, 'twou'd be impo&s;&s;ible for
'em to ride there, by rea&s;on of the &s;tormy Gu&s;ts
that happen &s;o frequently in that place.</P>
<P>After the charming View of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> from
the Sea of <HI>Marmora,</HI> I never beheld a finer Pro|&s;pect
than that of <HI>Venice.</HI> At the Di&s;tance of
Thirty Miles you begin to perceive the Spires of
the Churches, and the Pro&s;pect is &s;till enlarg'd
the nearer you approach; which gives the ravi&s;h'd
Spectatour the Idea of a Great City &s;pringing out
of the Water. Nor can you po&s;&s;ibly free your
&s;elf from this plea&s;ant Delu&s;ion of the Fancy till
<PB N="349" REF="198">
you have enter'd the Town; for all the outer
Hou&s;es of the City are founded on Piles in the
mid&s;t of the Water. The Port of <HI>Venice</HI> is a large
Plain cover'd with Water, in which there are cer|tain
I&s;lands or Ri&s;ing-Grounds, level with the
Water, on the bigge&s;t of which <HI>Venice</HI> is built.
mo&s;t of the other I&s;lands are al&s;o cover'd with
Buildings, and make particular Towns; the mo&s;t
con&s;iderable of which is call'd <HI>Judeca,</HI> or the <HI>Jews</HI>
Quarter. 'Tis &s;aid to contain Forty thou&s;and
Souls; the Hou&s;es are fair, and there are large
Gardens, whither the Inhabitants go to divert
them&s;elves during the Summer, and are accommo|dated
with all &s;orts of Provi&s;ions, cool Liquors,
and oftentimes with very agreeable Company.</P>
<P>The curious Traveller ought al&s;o to take a View
of the I&s;land of <HI>Mouran,</HI> where the fine Looking-Gla&s;&s;es
are made that are &s;o famous over all <HI>Eu|rope;</HI>
be&s;ides &s;everal other Curious Works in Gla&s;s
and Cry&s;tal.</P>
<P>The&s;e I&s;lands are call'd <HI>Lacunes</HI> or <HI>Lagunes,</HI> both
&s;uch as are, and &s;uch as are not, inhabited. Two
of 'em are &s;et apart for the u&s;e of tho&s;e who come
from the <HI>Levant,</HI> where they are oblig'd to perform
their <HI>Quarantain</HI> in certain large Ho&s;pitals, call'd
<HI>Lazaretti.</HI> The fir&s;t, call'd <HI>Lazaretto Vecchio,</HI> is but
a Mile di&s;tant from <HI>Venice;</HI> but the other, where
we are confin'd, is five Miles from the City. 'Tis
one continu'd Building, con&s;i&s;ting of two Stories,
300 Paces long, and divided by High Walls into
&s;ix Apartments, each of which has a particular
Gate that leads into a Square Court, where there
is a Well, but the Water is &s;o bad, that we never
u&s;e any but what is brought from <HI>Venice.</HI> Every
Apartment contains Twenty Chambers, Ten above,
and as many below, &s;eparated like Cells, with a
Chimney in each. Tho&s;e who perform their <HI>Qua|rantain</HI>
are con&s;tantly attended by a Guardian or
<PB N="350" REF="199">
Keeper, &s;ent for that purpo&s;e by the <HI>Tribunal of
Health.</HI> And we have the Misfortune to be plagu'd
with one who mortifies us extremely: For he not
only denies us the Liberty of conver&s;ing familiar|ly
with tho&s;e who come to &s;ee us, but will not
&s;uffer us to approach within Ten Paces of 'em;
and be&s;ides, they are oblig'd to take the Wind of
us. No Per&s;on what&s;oever, nor even the <HI>Doge</HI>
him&s;elf, is exempted from the&s;e trouble&s;ome Seve|rities,
which are appointed for the Publick Secu|rity,
and for the Pre&s;ervation of the City from
contagious Di&s;tempers. But tho' we are not per|mitted
to entertain tho&s;e who are without the <HI>La|zaretto,</HI>
there are &s;ome things which they are al|low'd
to receive from us, &s;uch as Bread, Wine,
Ve&s;&s;els, Tobacco, Money, Wood, and generally
every thing that does not con&s;i&s;t of Threads. And
yet, which in my Opinion is the mo&s;t intolerable
piece of Nicety in the World, they will not &s;uffer a
Letter to come out of our Hands till it be open'd
and &s;moak'd: And I was even forc'd to open
<HI>Mon&s;ieur de Hochepied's</HI> Letters to his Friends in <HI>Hol|land;</HI>
&s;o that I &s;hall be oblig'd to deliver 'em un|&s;eal'd
to the Per&s;ons to whom they are directed.
When a Man comes to lodge in one of the&s;e
Rooms, he finds nothing but Four bare Walls, and
mu&s;t therefore buy an entire Set of nece&s;&s;ary Fur|niture:
But as for Provi&s;ions, there are <HI>Barcarioli,</HI>
who bring whatever you call for, allowing 'em a
third part of the Price for their Pains. Every
Man mu&s;t be his own Cook, a Di&s;advantage
which is more ea&s;ily &s;upported here than any where
el&s;e; for our Time is &s;o great a Burthen to us,
that we are glad of any Occupation; and that
which in another Place would be reckon'd a Trou|ble,
is e&s;teem'd a Recreation here. The <HI>Lazaretto</HI>
is govern'd by a Prior, appointed by the <HI>Tribunal of
Health.</HI> His Revenue amounts to a Thou&s;and <HI>Du|cats,</HI>
<PB N="351" REF="199">
worth about 3 <HI>s.</HI> 9 <HI>d.</HI> a-piece. He is entru&s;t|ed
with the Keys of the &s;ix Apartments, which
are kept &s;hut from Sun-&s;etting till Eight a-Clock
in the Morning. The Guardians are under his
Command, and are oblig'd to give him an Ac|count
of every thing. There are 120 of 'em in
Office, who are employ'd by Turns, according to
the Number of Ships that arrive in the Port.
Their Salary, which amounts to half a <HI>Ducat</HI> a-Day,
be&s;ides their Entertainment, is not paid by
the Republic, but by a Tax laid upon the Pa&s;&s;en|gers
and Goods that are committed to their Care.
In the &s;ame <HI>Lagune</HI> there is a large Enclo&s;ure where
the Goods are laid in a &s;ort of Stalls or Market-Hou&s;es,
&s;upported by Pillars without Walls, and o|pen
on all Sides. And there are <HI>Faquini</HI> or Por|ters
appointed to remove 'em from time to time,
and to take care that nothing be lo&s;t or da|mag'd.</P>
<P>You have doubtle&s;s heard of the great Number of
Spies that are kept by the Senate to give notice
of every thing that is &s;aid or done again&s;t the Go|vernment.
The&s;e Informers are a horrible Plague
to tho&s;e who are under the Dominion of this Re|publick,
as well natural <HI>Venetians</HI> as <HI>Greeks.</HI> For
the lea&s;t Offence expo&s;es a Man to the Severity
of the Inqui&s;ition of the State, which is at lea&s;t
as terrible a Tribunal as that of <HI>Rome.</HI> Nor is it
po&s;&s;ible for a Man to know when he &s;hou'd be
upon his Guard; for tho&s;e who profe&s;s the great|e&s;t
Friend&s;hip and Fidelity, are oftentimes mere In|formers.
And be&s;ides, there are Spies of all Ranks
and Orders; Servants, Merchants, Officers, Citi|zens,
and Nobles, who di&s;gui&s;e them&s;elves with
&s;o much Care and Dexterity, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible
to penetrate into their hidden De&s;igns. The Re|public
is &s;o cautious in preventing Di&s;coveries of
this Nature, that tho&s;e who undertake &s;uch a Com|mi&s;&s;ion
<PB N="352" REF="200">
are enjoyn'd to conceal it even from their
Wives and Children, under pain of &s;uffering the
mo&s;t rigorous Penalties. And the Scandal and
Odium that attends their Profe&s;&s;ion is alone &s;uf|ficient
to oblige 'em to Secre&s;ie, tho' they were
not kept in awe by the Fear of Puni&s;hment. This
breeds an univer&s;al Diffidence and Shiene&s;s among
all &s;orts of People, and makes 'em extremely re|&s;erv'd
in di&s;covering their Sentiments to one ano|ther,
e&s;pecially in the pre&s;ence of certain Per&s;ons
who are more particularly &s;u&s;pected, &s;uch as <HI>Monks,</HI>
and the <HI>Guardians of Health</HI> in the <HI>Lazaretti,</HI> who
are generally reckon'd to be the Inqui&s;itor's Spies,
and I believe not without rea&s;on, as you will per|ceive
by the Relation of an Accident that hap|pen'd
to my &s;elf.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as a Ve&s;&s;el enters the Port, the <HI>Tribu|nal
of Health</HI> &s;ends immediately a Guardian with a
<HI>Phanti</HI> on board to conduct the Pa&s;&s;engers to the
<HI>Lazaretto,</HI> that no time may be lo&s;t; for the <HI>Qua|rantain</HI>
is not reputed to begin till the Day after
they come a-&s;hore. But tho' this Cu&s;tom is ve|ry
exactly ob&s;erv'd on all Occa&s;ions, there aro&s;e
a Di&s;pute in our Ship about &s;ome Matters relating
to Trade, that retarded our Landing Four Days,
which con&s;equently were not reckon'd in the For|ty
Days of our <HI>Quarantain.</HI> This Delay occa&s;ion'd
a general Di&s;content among us, and we were the
more &s;en&s;ibly afflicted, becau&s;e we neither fore&s;aw
nor knew how to remedy our Misfortunes. How|ever,
the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Venetians</HI> whom he had take
on board at <HI>Zant,</HI> conceal'd their Re&s;entments
with all po&s;&s;ible Care. But I who was not &s;o well
acquainted with the Cu&s;toms of the Place, and
perhaps am naturally of too free a Humour, cou'd
not forbear complaining of this Inju&s;tice that was
done us, and was even &s;o far tran&s;ported, that I
expre&s;s'd my Impatience and Indignation in very
<PB N="353" REF="200">
bold and emphatic Terms. In the mean time I
was extremely &s;urpriz'd to perceive an univer&s;al Si|lence
among tho&s;e who heard me, and was &s;o vex'd
to find that none of 'em wou'd join with me, that
at la&s;t I held my Peace. An Hour after, the Cap|tain
took me a&s;ide, and told me that I was ruin'd:
I entreated him to let me know the rea&s;on that
made him give me &s;o unwelcom an Admonition:
<HI>Becau&s;e,</HI> reply'd he, <HI>you have &s;poken di&s;advantageou&s;ly
of the Government before a Guardian, who is certainly
an Informer;</HI> adding, that he wou'd not have &s;po|ken
&s;o freely for a Hundred thou&s;and Crowns.
Then he related five or &s;ix Tragical Stories of Per|&s;ons
that had lo&s;t their Lives for le&s;s provoking
Crimes, and added &s;o many Arguments to convince
me of my Danger, that I began to be afraid in
good earne&s;t, and to complain of his Unkindne&s;s
in not giving me more timely warning. He re|ply'd,
that he ne'er thought of it, and that he
cou'd not imagine me to be ignorant of a thing
that was &s;o univer&s;ally known. <HI>The only way I
can &s;ugge&s;t to you,</HI> added he, <HI>to prevent your Ruine,
is to be &s;ilent for the future, and to bribe the Guardian
with a Pre&s;ent, which perhaps will &s;top his Mouth.</HI> In
pur&s;uance of his Advice, I gave the Guardian two
<HI>Sequins,</HI> and endeavour'd to oblige him by all
the Marks of Friend&s;hip and Kindne&s;s during the
two days we remain'd on Board after that Accident.
Yet after all, he inform'd again&s;t me, at lea&s;t I had
rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect him; for the Prior told me t'other
Day, that the Inqui&s;itor had &s;poken concerning
me, and had &s;ignify'd to him, that there was a
very turbulent and impatient <HI>Frenchman</HI> in his <HI>La|zaretto.</HI>
This Reprimand abated, in&s;tead of encrea|&s;ing,
my Fears, for the Inqui&s;itor wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d not have
&s;poken to the Prior, if he had intended to puni&s;h
my Boldne&s;s. However, this Accident &s;hall teach
me Circum&s;pection for the future; and may &s;erve
<PB N="354" REF="201">
for a Warning to &s;uch of your Friends who&s;e
Curio&s;ity may incite 'em to vi&s;it this Place in
their Travels: For Strangers are in a more parti|cular
manner expos'd to the Severities of that dread|ful
Tribunal; and I'm per&s;uaded that &s;uch indi|&s;creet

<HEAD>LETTER XXVII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AT la&s;t I have obtain'd my Liberty, and have
bidden a joyful <HI>Farewel</HI> to that na&s;ty <HI>Laza|retto,</HI>
where I was forc'd to do &s;o tedious a Pe|nance
for my Sins. And &s;ince I have rea&s;on to
believe that all my Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions are blotted out
by &s;o &s;evere a Mortification, I'm e'en re&s;olv'd to
venture upon a New Score: There is not a Town
in the World &s;o full of Invitations as this: I &s;ee
every Day &s;uch charming and enflaming Objects
at the <HI>Opera, Ridotti,</HI> and whither &s;o ever I go,
that a le&s;s &s;en&s;ible Heart than mine cou'd not long
re&s;i&s;t the powerful Temptation. There is a greater
Number of lovely Women here than in any other
Place of <HI>Europe,</HI> and their Charms are more allu|ring.
Three Divinities &s;eem to contend which of
'em &s;hou'd contribute mo&s;t to the Embelli&s;hment
of a City where they have fix'd the Seats of their
&s;everal Empires. <HI>Venus</HI> makes it the Scene of all
<PB N="355" REF="201">
the &s;oft Delights of Beauty and Love; <HI>Apollo</HI> di&s;|plays
the ravi&s;hing Variety of his belov'd Harmo|ny;
and <HI>Momus</HI> charms both the Eye and Ear
with &s;plendid Masks and ingenious and witty Co|medies.
<HI>Venice</HI> is a Clu&s;ter of inchanted I&s;lands,
where Joy and Plea&s;ure have e&s;tabli&s;hd their peace|ful
Sway, without the lea&s;t Di&s;turbance from tu|multuary
or gloomy Pa&s;&s;ions. 'Tis all over charm|ing;
every Object in&s;pires Love, and fills the Mind
with a re&s;i&s;tle&s;s and &s;urprizing Delight. But I mu&s;t
not forget that I write to one who is too inqui&s;i|tive
to be &s;atisfy'd with general Hints; and there|fore
I &s;hall proceed to give you a particular Account
of this admirable City. I intended to have begun
my Letter with the Story of a plea&s;ant Accident
that happen'd to one of my Friends at our coming
out of the <HI>Lazaretto,</HI> where he perform'd his <HI>Qua|rantain</HI>
with me; but tho' I am not often guilty
of a &s;crupulous Nicene&s;s in ob&s;erving the Rules of
an exact Method, I'm loath on this Occa&s;ion to
invert the Order I intend to follow in the De&s;cri|ption
of the City; and therefore I &s;hall defer the
Relation of my Friend's Adventure, till I come to
&s;peak of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Curtezans.</P>
<P>The Ob&s;ervation I made concerning <HI>Con&s;tantino|ple</HI>
and <HI>Cairo,</HI> may with equal Ju&s;tice be apply'd
to <HI>Venice,</HI> and in the general to all great and po|pulous
Cities; that there are very different Opini|ons
concerning their Extent, and the Number of
their Inhabitants. Nor is this Controver&s;ie &s;o ea|&s;ily
decided as &s;ome Per&s;ons imagine: For when
did ever a Traveller undertake to count the Streets
of a great City? Or what more can the mo&s;t in|qui&s;itive
Stranger do than to mea&s;ure the Dimen|&s;ions
of a Publick Place, or of a Temple? Judge then
whether any one can make a certain Computati|on
of the Number of the Hou&s;es, or of the Per|&s;ons
that inhabit 'em. And I may venture to
<PB N="356" REF="202">
add, that none but a Soveraign is able to manage
&s;uch a De&s;ign; and that the exacte&s;t Calculations
that can be made by Private Per&s;ons, are mere
uncertain Conjectures, that can never be true but
by a lucky Hit, on which there can be no depen|dance.
The &s;ame may be &s;aid of the Bigne&s;s of a
City, which ought rather to be computed from the
Figure, than from the Extent of its Circumfe|rence:
And 'tis &s;o difficult a Task to find and de|&s;cribe
the true Figure of a Town, that the Inha|bitants
them&s;elves are ignorant of it. How many
different Judgments are made of the comparative
Bigne&s;s of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Paris?</HI> Yet every Man
thinks his own Opinion true; and the &s;ame Re|mark
may be apply'd to all other large Cities.
I will not undertake then to determine &s;o intricate
a Controver&s;ie, but &s;hall content my &s;elf with ac|quainting
you, that <HI>Venice,</HI> as to its Extent, may,
in my Opinion, be compar'd to <HI>Rome,</HI> that the
Streets are Narrow, the Ground extremely well
Husbanded, and the Hou&s;es full of People to the
very Top. It has neither Gates, Walls, nor Cit|tadel,
and yet cannot be ju&s;tly &s;aid to be Weak.
'Tis e&s;teem'd impregnable by many Authors, and
that Opinion is &s;o generally receiv'd, that you
&s;hall hardly hear any Man give an Account of
<HI>Venice</HI> without that Encomium at the End of it.
The <HI>Venetians</HI> them&s;elves tell the Story &s;o often,
that at la&s;t they imagine it to be a certain Truth,
and wou'd fain per&s;uade others to be of the &s;ame
Opinion. But tho' they alledge &s;ome Rea&s;ons in
Confirmation of that A&s;&s;ertion, they mu&s;t not
expect to make us &s;wallow 'em by an implicit
Faith. At lea&s;t I can a&s;&s;ure you, their Arguments
have made no great Impre&s;&s;ion upon me; for I
cou'd never boa&s;t &s;o &s;trong a Faith as to give
Credit to an obvious Ab&s;urdity. However, Ex|perience
has taught me &s;o much Wi&s;dom, that I
<PB N="357" REF="202">
&s;hall hardly venture to own my Opinion in this
Ca&s;e during my abode here. Let 'em magnifie
their City beyond all the Forts in the World,
and defie the Ambition of the mo&s;t potent Sove|reigns
in <HI>Europe;</HI> their Arrogance &s;hall never ex|tort
one indi&s;creet Word from me &s;o long as I
remain within the reach of the Inqui&s;ition: But as
&s;oon as I can &s;et my Foot beyond the Limits of
their Dominions, I &s;hall e'en make bold to talk
as freely to any Man of the boa&s;ted Strength of
their City, as I now intend to write to you.</P>
<P>You may remember I acknowledg'd that <HI>Venice</HI>
is impregnable on the Side next the Sea, and gave
you an Account of the Rea&s;ons which inclin'd me
to be of that Opinion. But I'm fully per&s;uaded
that 'tis not impo&s;&s;ible to attack it with Suc|ce&s;s
on the other &s;ide, unle&s;s it be defended by an
Army &s;trong enough to baffle all the Attempts of
the Be&s;iegers, in which Ca&s;e, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, it
may be &s;aid to be impregnable; but upon the &s;ame
Suppo&s;ition any Town in the World may plead a
Right to that Title: Whereas a Place that may
be properly call'd impregnable, mu&s;t be &s;trong e|nough
to endure a Siege two or three Years with|out
Relief; that is, it mu&s;t be able to re&s;i&s;t any
Enemy but Famine, which is a nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;e|quence
of a long and clo&s;e Siege. I confe&s;s there
are very few &s;uch Places in the World; yet I
have &s;een one, I mean <HI>Malta,</HI> and 'tis probable
there are &s;ome other Forts which merit the &s;ame
Character. As for tho&s;e Places that may be &s;ubdu'd
by Force, tho' not without extreme Difficulty, they
may and ought to be call'd <HI>Strong,</HI> but cannot ju&s;t|ly
be &s;aid to be <HI>Impregnable.</HI> Yet the la&s;t of the&s;e
Epithets is very frequently abus'd and mi&s;apply'd;
for 'tis as u&s;ual to honour a Place with that Title,
as 'tis rare to find one that de&s;erves it.</P>
<P><PB N="358" REF="203">
If this be the true meaning of the controvert|ed
Term, and if none but &s;uch Places as the&s;e
can be properly &s;aid to be impregnable, as 'tis plain
they cannot; I know no rea&s;on that &s;hou'd hin|der
me from excluding <HI>Venice</HI> out of that Number.
It &s;eems to be no very difficult Undertaking to
&s;eize on the <HI>Lido</HI> and <HI>Malamoca,</HI> two inhabited
I&s;lands, and by &s;ecuring tho&s;e Po&s;ts, to intercept
the Communication of the City with the Sea,
and to cut off all Relief that might be expected
that way. An Army might al&s;o &s;oon take Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of &s;everal little uninhabited <HI>Lagunes</HI> about
<HI>Venice,</HI> from whence the City might be ea&s;ily bat|ter'd
and bombarded; and God knows what Ha|vock
the Bombs wou'd make in &s;o compact a Ci|ty
as this. And be&s;ides, the Multitude of the In|habitants
wou'd quickly expo&s;e 'em to all the De|&s;olations
that are u&s;ually caus'd by Famine. I
confe&s;s the Ar&s;enal is &s;o well furni&s;h'd that all the
Burghers might be arm'd in Four and twenty
Hours; but what u&s;e cou'd they make of their
Arms in a Town which in ca&s;e of a Siege wou'd
in&s;tantly be turn'd to a Pri&s;on: For there is no
cover'd Way thro' which they cou'd &s;ally out upon
their Enemies; and tho' they cou'd contrive one, the
Citizens of <HI>Venice</HI> wou'd make but a very feeble
re&s;i&s;tance. I have &s;o mean an Opinion of their
Military accompli&s;hments, that I dare boldly af|firm
that Ten thou&s;and well-di&s;cipln'd Soldiers
wou'd do more execution than a Hundred thou|&s;and
of 'em. Was not <HI>Paris</HI> &s;tarv'd by 30000 Men,
tho' at the &s;ame time it was defended by 150000
Citizens, who might have &s;ally'd out when they
pleas'd? What then wou'd become of <HI>Venice</HI> in
&s;uch a Ca&s;e, where the be&s;ieg'd mu&s;t be coop'd up
in their Hou&s;es, and cou'd never make a Sally to di|&s;turb
or annoy their Enemies? Perhaps I &s;hall be
laugh'd at for maintaining that this wonderful
<PB N="359" REF="203">
Place that di&s;pi&s;es and defies the mo&s;t potent and
triumphant Enemies, might be enter'd and &s;et on
Fire by a &s;ufficient Number of Men with Tor|ches
in their Hands, without the Trouble or
Charge of Bombardment. But I wou'd willingly
be inform'd what cou'd hinder 100000 Men from
making and executing &s;uch an Attempt. There
are no Walls to &s;top or retard their Progre&s;s; the
City is open in Four&s;core &s;everal Places, all the
Hou&s;es that &s;urround it are pierc'd with Doors
and Shops, and many of 'em are built of Wood.
I confe&s;s &s;uch an Expedition wou'd require a va&s;t
Number of Boats; but when I &s;peak of 100000
Men, I do not mean that they &s;hou'd all be em|ploy'd
in the Attempt: The Fifth part of 'em
wou'd &s;erve to carry on the Attack; and the Be|&s;iegers
might find a &s;ufficient Number of Boats in
the adjacent Harbours, without giving them&s;elves
the trouble of making new ones.</P>
<P>My Opinion in this Ca&s;e is &s;o &s;ingular, and &s;o
directly oppo&s;ite to the Notions that are enter|tain'd
by the generality of Mankind, that you will
doubtle&s;s &s;cruple to give Credit to my &s;ingle Te|&s;timony,
e&s;pecially &s;ince the Arguments I bring to
confirm it depend on certain Circum&s;tances with
which you never had occa&s;ion to be acquainted.
And you will be apt to tell me, that the <HI>Veneti|ans</HI>
wou'd certainly have taken care to fortifie
their Capital City, if its Natural Strength were
not incapable of any Artificial Improvements. In
an&s;wer to the fir&s;t part of this Difficulty, I &s;hall
only repeat what I have already told you, that
'twas never my Cu&s;tom to make my Judgment
a Slave to Authority, or to regulate my own, by
the Opinions of others. I'm per&s;uaded that a blind
Submi&s;&s;ion to Vulgar Notions, is one of the mo&s;t
fertil Sources of Error, and that there is nothing
<PB N="360" REF="204">
&s;o variable and uncertain, as the Sentiments of
Men in different Places and Ages.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s the other part of the Objection con|tains
a greater and more puzzling Difficulty. But
tho' the Conduct of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Senate in this
Ca&s;e &s;eems at fir&s;t View to depend upon &s;ome
&s;ecret Rea&s;ons of State, the My&s;tery lies not &s;o
deep but that it may be ea&s;ily unriddl'd by a mo|derate
Degree of Application. You know that the
Government of <HI>Venice</HI> is purely <HI>Ari&s;tocratical,</HI> and
that the Revolutions which happen in &s;uch Con|&s;titutions,
are u&s;ually occa&s;ion'd by &s;uffering one
of the Members of the Body in which the Go|vernment
is lodg'd, to over-top the re&s;t: For an
Ambitious Per&s;on may be ea&s;ily tempted by &s;o
inviting an Opportunity, to e&s;tabli&s;h the Gran|deur
of his Family by oppre&s;&s;ing his Fellow-Ci|tizens,
and to erect a Monarchy upon the Ruines
of the Republick. Hi&s;tory and Experience furni&s;h
us with &s;o many In&s;tances of &s;uch Revolutions,
and the&s;e Examples are &s;o univer&s;ally known, that
'twou'd be needle&s;s either to cite 'em, or to alledge any
other Arguments to prove &s;o well-atte&s;ted a Truth.
Now the Senate of <HI>Venice,</HI> who&s;e Maxims are,
without Controver&s;ie, grounded on the mo&s;t re|fin'd
Politicks, making a wi&s;e u&s;e of the Misfor|tunes
of other States, and being well acquainted
with the weak part of their own, have endea|vour'd
to prevent the Inconveniences that might
ari&s;e from that nece&s;&s;ary Flaw in their Con&s;ti|tution,
by the mo&s;t prudent Laws and Provi&s;o's
that ever were invented; and their Care for the
Pre&s;ervation of the State has been attended with
&s;uch excellent Succe&s;s, that the Republic conti|nues
&s;till to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on the &s;ame Foundations on
which 'twas fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h'd. To give you a Spe|cimen
of the admirable Politicks of that wi&s;e Bo|dy,
I &s;hall briefly take notice of &s;ome of tho&s;e
<PB N="361" REF="204">
Laws and Cu&s;toms that are interwoven with the
Con&s;titution of their Government. The <HI>Doge</HI> is
entru&s;ted with &s;o &s;mall a Share in the Management
of the State, that he may be ju&s;tly call'd a meer
Shadow of Grandeur. There are Inqui&s;itors ap|pointed
to have an Eye upon his Actions, who may
call him to an Account when they plea&s;e. He is not
allow'd the Liberty of public and familiar Con|ver&s;ation,
nor &s;uffer'd to appear in the City but
on certain Days of Ceremony. The Nobles are
forbidden to entertain any corre&s;pondence with
Foreign Princes, or their Mini&s;ters. They are not
permitted to wear Arms, to u&s;e any Ornaments of
Gold or Silver, to keep a numerous Train of Ser|vants,
or to affect any Marks of Grandeur. The
Cu&s;tom of walking in the <HI>Broglio</HI> was introduc'd
to prevent the dangerous Con&s;equences of pri|vate
Cabals. The Inqui&s;itors of State were e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd
for the Security of the Government; and
'tis the &s;ame Con&s;ideration that moves 'em to
entertain above a Thou&s;and Spies. And to con|clude,
that illu&s;trious Body in which the Go|vernment
is lodg'd, the celebrated <HI>Senate of Venice,</HI>
which knows &s;o well how to maintain its Ho|nour
on other Occa&s;ions, keeps neither Guards a|bout
the Place of its meeting, nor a Garri&s;on in
the Town; wi&s;ely con&s;idering, that if ever an In|&s;urrection
&s;hou'd happen, tho&s;e Mercenary Soldiers,
however appointed for the Defence and Pre&s;er|vation
of the State, wou'd be made the In&s;tru|ments
of its Ruine.</P>
<P>I will not trouble you with a particular Ac|count
of all the Laws and Regulations that were
in&s;tituted for the &s;ame end, and are &s;till ob&s;erv'd
in this place. But from what has been &s;aid on
this Subject, you may ea&s;ily perceive that tho&s;e
prudent Senatours make it their principal Care to
prevent Inte&s;tine Di&s;orders, and to render the
<PB N="362" REF="205">
Nobles incapable of invading the Public Li|berty.</P>
<P>Now if the Senate &s;hou'd order a Citadel or
Fort to be built at <HI>Venice,</HI> they might with Ju|&s;tice
be accus'd of contriving the In&s;truments of
their own Ruine, and of undermining that No|ble
Fabric, which they have taken &s;o great Care
to &s;ecure. But they are too wi&s;e to be guilty of
&s;o fatal a Blunder; and 'tis better to be in &s;ome
mea&s;ure expos'd to the In&s;ults of Foreign Inva|ders,
than to lie at the Mercy of Dome&s;tic Ene|mies.
Be&s;ides they have no Rea&s;on to be afraid
of their Neighbours; for 'tis the Intere&s;t of all the
Princes and States of <HI>Italy,</HI> to pre&s;erve the Repub|lic,
that it may continue to be the Bulwark of
<HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> on that &s;ide, and to counter-balance the
Power of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria.</HI> And as for the
<HI>Turks,</HI> they are at too great a Di&s;tance to un|dertake
an Expedition again&s;t the City.</P>
<P>Thus you &s;ee that there are &s;everal weighty
Con&s;iderations that deter the Senate from forti|fying
their Capital City: and there are no le&s;s
pre&s;&s;ing Rea&s;ons that oblige 'em to encourage
the Vulgar Opinion of its pretended Impregna|bility.</P>
<P>If I &s;hou'd &s;end you a particular De&s;cription
of this City, I cou'd only entertain you with a
Repetition of what you have read perhaps in a hun|dred
Authors. And therefore I &s;hall content my
&s;elf with communicating &s;ome of my Remarks to
you, in a loo&s;e and familiar manner.</P>
<P>Some pretend that <HI>Venice</HI> is built on &s;eventy
two I&s;lands or <HI>Lagunes,</HI> which are &s;eparated by
&s;uch narrow Chanels that they &s;eem to form
one little Continent: and there are others who re|ject
this Opinion. I will not undertake to de|cide
the Controver&s;ie, but only tell you what I
have &s;een, and leave the whole Matter to your
<PB N="363" REF="205">
Judgment. 'Tis certain that <HI>Venice</HI> is founded on
a Spot of Ground that ri&s;es at lea&s;t to the Surface
of the Water; for the Earth appears in the Streets,
Keys, public Places, and Hou&s;es. 'Tis true they
are forc'd to make u&s;e of Piles, becau&s;e the Ground
is not firm enough to &s;upport the Weight of a large
Palace without &s;inking: but that ought not to
make us doubt the Truth of a thing that is con|firm'd
by the Te&s;timony of our own Eyes; for
the &s;ame way of Building is generally us'd in all
Moori&s;h or Fenny Places, and particularly in <HI>Hol|land.</HI>
'Tis no le&s;s certain that this Spot of Ground
is at pre&s;ent a Ma&s;s of I&s;lands, &s;o that it remains
only to con&s;ider whether the Canals that &s;epa|rate
the&s;e little I&s;lands be Natural or Artificial.
This Que&s;tion is not ea&s;ily to be determin'd, for
one may alledge very plau&s;ible Arguments either
for the Affirmative or Negative part. 'Tis pro|bable
the <HI>Venetians</HI> might dig the&s;e Chanels, for
the more convenient Carriage of Goods, which by
this means are brought to their Doors, and for
the Embelli&s;hment of the City, which is the on|ly
Town in the World that can boa&s;t of &s;uch a
Situation. But there are &s;o many, and &s;o con&s;i|derable
Rea&s;ons, which favour the contrary Opi|nion,
that I'm almo&s;t entirely convinc'd of the
Truth of it. In the fir&s;t place, 'Tis plain that the
<HI>Venetians</HI> have taken all po&s;&s;ible Care to husband
the Ground on which the City is founded. The
Streets are &s;o narrow, that in mo&s;t of 'em three
Men cannot walk a-brea&s;t, and in &s;ome, one Man
can hardly pa&s;s by another. And the Foundati|ons
of the Hou&s;es on one &s;ide are laid in the
Water, without any Key or Pa&s;&s;age betwixt 'em
and the Canals. We cannot then &s;uppo&s;e, with
the lea&s;t Shadow of Probability, that the Pro&s;pect
of any Conveniency cou'd oblige 'em to wa&s;te
&s;o con&s;iderable a quantity of that Ground which
<PB N="364" REF="206">
they manage &s;o thriftily, that the City is every|where
full of Boundaries, to re&s;train the Proprietors
of the Hou&s;es from breaking in upon the
Streets. And be&s;ides, what Rea&s;on can there be
alledg'd for their leaving &s;o many large Spots of
Ground entire; for tho' you are inform'd that a
Man may go in a Boat to any Hou&s;e in the
City, you mu&s;t not take the&s;e Words in a &s;trict
and literal Sen&s;e, but only as a figurative Expre&s;|&s;ion,
to &s;ignifie that there are a great Number of
&s;uch Hou&s;es in <HI>Venice.</HI> I can a&s;&s;ure you that
there is not a Canal within five hundred Paces
round of the Hou&s;e where I lodge; and that
there are twenty &s;uch Places in the City. I &s;hall
only add that the Canals are crooked, and ge|nerally
unequal both in Length and Breadth;
which, in my Opinion, may &s;erve to convince
any con&s;idering Per&s;on, that they are not Arti|ficial.</P>
<P>All the Streets in the City, without Exception,
are narrow and crooked; but to make amends
for the&s;e Di&s;advantages, they are &s;o clean that one
may walk a Year in 'em without meeting with
any Dirt: and be&s;ides they are pav'd with large
&s;quare Stones, which always after a Shower grow
as white as Marble. In &s;everal parts of the City
there are little empty places call'd <HI>Campi</HI> or Fields;
which were probably left for the Conveniency of
intrenching, if an Enemy &s;hou'd enter the Town;
for they are not at all Ornamental. The only
con&s;iderable Place or Field in <HI>Venice,</HI> is that of S.
<HI>Mark,</HI> which certainly claims all our Admirati|on.
'Tis two hundred and fifty Paces long, and
eighty broad. The Church of S. <HI>Mark</HI> faces one
of the Ends of it, and that of S. <HI>Geminian</HI> the
other. 'Tis border'd on each &s;ide with tho&s;e &s;tate|ly
Piles of Building call'd the <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>New Pro|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters">aties,</HI>
which make it, without Controver&s;ie, the
<PB N="365" REF="206">
mo&s;t Magnificent Place in the World. The
Front of each Procuraty is &s;upported by a large
Portico, ten Paces broad; and all along
there are double Piazza's, one of which entering
into the Building &s;erves for Shops, which are lett
by the <HI>Signiory</HI> to tho&s;e who &s;ell Perfumes, Li|monade,
and Coffee. The Procurators of S. <HI>Mark</HI>
lodge in the&s;e Palaces, which for that Rea&s;on are
call'd the <HI>Procuraties:</HI> but when any Foreign Prince
comes to take a View of 'em, or on &s;ome other
Occa&s;ions of Public Rejoicing, the Partitions are
taken down, &s;o that one may walk from one
End to the other, and all the &s;everal Apartments
are united into one &s;pacious Hou&s;e. That on the
Right-hand, as you go to S. <HI>Mark</HI>'s Church, is
call'd the <HI>New,</HI> and that on the Left the <HI>Old
Procuraty.</HI> The fir&s;t has two principal Fronts, one
of which looks into the Place of S. <HI>Mark,</HI> and
the other into the <HI>Broglio,</HI> over-again&s;t the Palace
of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> which is an Ancient and Magnifi|cent
Structure, where all the Councils meet; &s;uch
as the <HI>Grand Council,</HI> the <HI>Council of the Finances</HI> call'd
the <HI>Ceca,</HI> the <HI>Marine Council,</HI> &amp;c. The <HI>Ceca</HI> is a
di&s;tinct Apartment in the Palace of S. <HI>Mark;</HI>
and tho' 'tis built after the &s;ame Manner, and
with the &s;ame Stones, the large Grates and dou|ble
Doors of Iron, with which 'tis inclos'd, make
it re&s;emble a Pri&s;on rather than a Palace: And
be&s;ides the Smoak that ari&s;es from the Furna|ces
has &s;o penetrated the Stone-Walls, that they are
black even within the Chambers. Here the Mo|ney
is coin'd, and the Public Trea&s;ure kept in
great Iron Che&s;ts, &s;ecur'd with three Locks, the Keys
of which are committed to the Cu&s;tody of three
Procurators, who, under Pain of Death, dare not
make the lea&s;t Attempt to open 'em till they are
all met together. The Council &s;its twice a Week,
<PB N="366" REF="207">
which are the only Days for all &s;orts of Pay|ments.</P>
<P>The little <HI>Ar&s;enal</HI> of the Nobles, who&s;e Arms
are always kept ready charg'd, is in the &s;ame
Palace of S. <HI>Mark;</HI> and the <HI>Doge</HI>'s Apartment is
in the Right-Wing, from whence there is a Pa&s;|&s;age
to the Church, whither he goes &s;ometimes
<HI>incognito</HI> to hear Ma&s;s; but u&s;ually he per|forms
his Devotions at a private Chapel in his own
Apartment.</P>
<P>S. <HI>Mark</HI>'s Church is a large Structure, &s;quare on
the Out-&s;ide, cover'd with four Leaden Domes,
of which the large&s;t is in the Middle, without
any Spires or Steeples. The Top is &s;urrounded
with Stone Bali&s;ters for the Conveniency of walk|ing.
You enter the Church thro' a Portico com|pos'd
of five Arches, the highe&s;t of which is in
the Middle. There you may take a View of
tho&s;e Large and Stately Gates of Bra&s;s, which the
<HI>Venetians</HI> brought from <HI>Santa Sophia</HI> at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI>
when they robb'd that City of &s;o many valuable
Curio&s;ities to enrich their own. Among the re&s;t, I
cannot forbear taking Notice of the four Brazen
Hor&s;es that are plac'd upon the &s;ame Portico. 'Tis Pity
they are not more carefully pre&s;erv'd; for they are
&s;o finely &s;hap'd, that Nature her &s;elf cou'd not
mend tho&s;e Artificial Animals. 'Tis true, they
have endeavour'd to piece 'em, but all their Care
and Skill will never be able to re&s;tore 'em to their
primitive Beauty.</P>
<P>The Figure of the Church within re&s;embles a
Cro&s;s, the Quire repre&s;enting the upper part. 'Tis
vaulted throughout, and enrich'd with very fine
<HI>Mo&s;aic</HI>-Work, like that of <HI>Santa Sophia,</HI> but not
near &s;o la&s;ting: for it decays &s;o fa&s;t, that they are
forc'd to keep &s;ome Workmen on purpo&s;e to re|pair
it; whereas the other remains entire notwith|&s;tanding
its great Antiquity. And be&s;ides there is
<PB N="367" REF="207">
another Difference betwixt the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI>-Work at <HI>Ve|nice,</HI>
and that at <HI>Santa Sophia;</HI> for the latter is
&s;mooth and plain, whereas the former is full of Fi|gures.
The&s;e are the only Pieces of this Nature I
have had occa&s;ion to &s;ee in my Travels, ex|cept
one at <HI>Scio.</HI> The Floor of the Church is
adorn'd with another &s;ort of <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> no le&s;s preci|ous
than the former, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal &s;mall
Pieces of Porphyrie, Ja&s;per, and Serpentine or
&s;peckl'd Marble, not unlike to the Tables and Ca|binets
of Ebony, that are inlaid with Shells and
Naker.</P>
<P>The Arms of all the <HI>Doges</HI> that have hitherto
govern'd the Republic are plac'd round the Walls.
They are generally magnificent, and even &s;ome of
'em are of Silver curiou&s;ly wrought. The only Fault
I can find in this Church is its Ob&s;curity, which
hides the greate&s;t part of its Beauties: For in all
other re&s;pects 'tis enrich'd with the fine&s;t Orna|ments,
&s;uch as Altars, Pictures, and Ve&s;&s;els of Gold
and Silver. 'Twou'd be needle&s;s to pre&s;ent you
with a Catalogue of the rare Curio&s;ities that are to
be &s;een either in the Church or Trea&s;ury, &s;ince
you will find 'em all particularly de&s;crib'd in a
Treati&s;e written by <HI>Mon&s;ieur de S. Didier.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis Pity the <HI>Venetians</HI> &s;hou'd have lo&s;t the Body
of their good Patron, S. <HI>Mark,</HI> and that their Lo&s;s
&s;hou'd be attended with this mortifying Circum|&s;tance,
that they know neither the Time nor Oc|ca&s;ion
of it. 'Tis true the common People believe
that he retir'd into a Pillar, which they &s;hew'd
me, and that he thru&s;t his Hand out of that Co|lumn
when he gave the Ring to the <HI>Doge;</HI> but
mo&s;t of 'em &s;cruple not to confe&s;s that they know
not where he is, nor whither he went.</P>
<P>They made me al&s;o take Notice of a Stone,
which they pretend is the &s;ame that yielded Water
to the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> when they were tormented with
<PB N="368" REF="208">
Thir&s;t in the Wilderne&s;s. If this be true, we mu&s;t
allow that Rock a Power to multiply its Kind; for
'tis &s;till to be &s;een in the De&s;arts of <HI>Arabia,</HI> be|tween
<HI>Sues</HI> and <HI>Tor,</HI> as I have heard &s;everal credible
Per&s;ons affirm, as well <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> as <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Moors,</HI>
who a&s;&s;ure me that it &s;tands by it &s;elf in the
mid&s;t of a Sandy De&s;art; and that one may both
ea&s;ily perceive the Holes that gave a Pa&s;&s;age to the
Water, and di&s;cern the very Track or Print that
was made by the Stream.</P>
<P>The next place in <HI>Venice</HI> that claims a particular
Ob&s;ervation, is the <HI>Ar&s;enal,</HI> which is certainly the be&s;t
furni&s;h'd Magazine in the World. For tho' it
contains no le&s;s than two Miles in Compa&s;s, 'tis
fill'd and even crowded with Cannons, Bombs,
Granadoes, Muskets, Sabres, Gun-powder, Ropes,
Sails, Anchors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> To give you an E&s;timate of
the prodigious Quantity of Ammunition that is
hoarded up in this Place, 'twill be &s;ufficient to
tell you, that in ca&s;e of Nece&s;&s;ity, 'tis &s;ufficient
to arm and equip fifteen Galleys, four Galea&s;&s;es,
as many Ships, and a hundred thou&s;and Men. The
<HI>Ar&s;enal</HI> is govern'd by three Nobles, and under
them by the Pilot of the Republic, whom they
call the Admiral, who is entru&s;ted with the Care
and In&s;pection both of the Stores, and of two or
three hundred Men, that are con&s;tantly kept at
Work. He never goes to Sea but once a Year,
to &s;teer the <HI>Bucentaur</HI> on <HI>A&s;cen&s;ion-Day,</HI> when the
Duke accompany'd by all the Nobles, performs
the Ceremony of Wedding the Sea. They &s;et &s;o
high a Value upon this Ve&s;&s;el, that the Pilot is
oblig'd under Pain of Death to bring it back in
Safety; which makes him &s;o cautious in ob&s;erving
the Weather, that when he perceives any Clouds,
or the lea&s;t Appearance of a Wind on the Day ap|pointed
for the Solemnity, he procures it to be de|lay'd
till the next <HI>Sunday.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="369" REF="208">
'Tis the Opinion of one, That <HI>Venice</HI> contains
Four hundred Palaces, fit to receive and entertain a
King. This is certainly a very bold A&s;&s;ertion; and
yet I dare not po&s;itively contradict it: for the Pa|laces
are &s;o Numerous and Magnificent, that I
may venture, without a <HI>Hyperbole,</HI> to affirm that
they are &s;ufficient to adorn Ten Cities. On the
great Canal alone there are at lea&s;t Two hundred,
which &s;eem to out-rival one another, whether you
con&s;ider the Boldne&s;s of the De&s;ign, or the Fine|ne&s;s
of the Structure; and confound the amaz'd
Spectatour with &s;o va&s;t a Medley of different Beau|ties,
that he knows not which to prefer, or
where to point at the Principal Object of his
Admiration. If your Curio&s;ity &s;hou'd lead you
out of the City, to take a View of the neigh|bouring
Continent, e&s;pecially towards <HI>Padua,</HI> you
wou'd be tempted to fan&s;ie your &s;elf among the
Habitations of the Gods; for every Palace re&s;em|bles
a Magnificent Temple, adorn'd with all the mo&s;t
exqui&s;ite Beauties of Architecture. It mu&s;t be ac|knowledg'd
that the <HI>Italians,</HI> and particularly the
<HI>Venetians,</HI> are the be&s;t Architects in the World;
and that the fine&s;t Hou&s;es in <HI>France</HI> are not
comparable to the&s;e Palaces on the Out&s;ide.</P>
<P>I &s;hall take this Occa&s;ion to give you a gene|ral
Idea of their Manner of Building. The Height
of the Edifice is exactly proportion'd to its Big|ne&s;s,
according to the nice&s;t Rules of Architecture.
The Hou&s;es are cover'd with fine Platforms, where
a Man may enjoy the Plea&s;ure of walking with|out
going out of his own Hou&s;e; and when he grows
weary may either &s;it down on the Benches, or re&s;t
on the Bali&s;ters that &s;urround the Platform. The
Fronts of the Hou&s;es are adorn'd with Portico's, Co|lumns,
Balconies at the Windows, Frizes, Fe&s;toons,
Niches, and Statues. The&s;e Ornaments are accom|pany'd
with Courts, Anti-Courts, delicious Gardens,
<PB N="370" REF="209">
Fountains, Grotto's, and all the other Embelli&s;h|ments
that a luxurious Fancy can contrive. I can
a&s;&s;ure you that this is a true and faithful Re|pre&s;entation
of the&s;e glorious Edifices; and I leave
you to judge whether they may not ju&s;tly be
call'd Palaces, and whether any thing cou'd give a
higher Idea of the Grandeur of the <HI>Venetian</HI> No|bles.
The main Rea&s;on, in my Opinion, that
makes 'em employ &s;o great a part of their Trea&s;ure
in Building, is becau&s;e they are not permitted to
di&s;play their Magnificence any other way. For
&s;ince they are not &s;uffer'd to con&s;ume their Mo|ney
in &s;plendid Equipages, and rich Habits, 'tis
plain they mu&s;t either build, or find &s;ome other
way to be&s;tow their &s;uperfluous Ca&s;h. And, 'tis
probably the &s;ame Re&s;traint that tempts 'em to
throw away &s;uch va&s;t quantities of Money on
Courtezans and at Play. You wou'd hardly be|lieve
me, if I &s;hou'd tell you what prodigious Summs
are con&s;um'd every Year at <HI>Ba&s;&s;ette,</HI> e&s;pecially du|ring
the <HI>Carnaval;</HI> when the <HI>Ridotti</HI> or Gaming-Hou&s;es
are open. None are admitted into the&s;e
Hou&s;es without Masks; that all &s;orts of People
may enjoy an equal Liberty, and that there may
be no Occa&s;ion for Di&s;putes, nor any Marks of
Di&s;tinction in a place where every one is welcome
for his Money, and where there is always a con|fus'd
Medley of Noblemen, Citizens, Ladies, and
Courtezans: Yet this Order is not ob&s;erv'd with
the utmo&s;t Rigour; for one that has a fal&s;e No&s;e,
or counterfeit Whiskers is held to be &s;ufficiently
Mask'd. The Nobles keep the Bank, and relieve
one another by turns from Morning till Night.
They bear good or bad Fortune without di&s;cover|ing
the lea&s;t Alteration either in their Counte|nance
or Humour: and &s;eem as little concern'd
when they lo&s;e a Thou&s;and <HI>Sequins</HI> by one Card,
as when they gain One by another. I have
<PB N="371" REF="209">
had Occa&s;ion two or three times to &s;ee the Bank
broke, but cou'd never perceive the lea&s;t Sign of
Di&s;turbance in the unfortunate Game&s;ter. And
which is no le&s;s &s;urprizing, I have &s;een other No|blemen
continue to play with the Lo&s;er, upon his
bare Word, to the Value of Ten thou&s;and Ducats,
which were always punctually paid next Morning.
'Tis true, the Lo&s;s does not fall wholly upon one
Per&s;on, for there are &s;ometimes a Hundred of 'em
join'd together; and this is perhaps the main Rea|&s;on
that makes 'em bear their Misfortunes &s;o pa|tiently.
Be&s;ides the Bank is &s;eldom a Lo&s;er at
the la&s;t; and the <HI>Ridotti</HI> are &s;ometimes &s;o full of
Money, that they know not where to keep it.
All the Ca&s;h is entru&s;ted to the Care of &s;ome
Nobleman, who is u&s;ually one of the poorer Sort;
and yet 'tis never ob&s;erv'd that he retains &s;o much
as one Peny.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Remember I told you, that the Order of <HI>Mal|ta</HI>
might be divided into four Cla&s;&s;es; and I
&s;hall begin this Letter with applying the &s;ame Ob|&s;ervation
to the Noblemen of <HI>Venice:</HI> for tho' all
who bear that Name are united into one Body,
their Families are not equally Illu&s;trious. The fir&s;t
<HI>Cla&s;&s;is</HI> or Rank, con&s;i&s;ts of tho&s;e Families who foun|ded
the Republic, and were Noble before that
time. The &s;econd comprehends tho&s;e who were
elected before the Shutting up of the Council,
which was call'd, <HI>Il Serrar del Con&s;iglio.</HI> The third
contains tho&s;e who obtain'd that Honour as a Re|compence
for &s;ome eminent Services done to the
State; and are therefore call'd Gentlemen by Me|rit.
And the fourth is made up of <HI>Nobili per Soldi,</HI>
or <HI>Gentlemen by Purcha&s;e,</HI> who bought the Title. But
notwith&s;tanding &s;o con&s;iderable a Difference in their
Pedigrees, they have all an equal Right to give
their Voices, and enjoy the &s;ame Privileges: All,
from the Highe&s;t to the Lowe&s;t, go to the Great
Council, and are honour'd with the Title of <HI>Excel|lency.</HI>
And even it happens not unfrequently that
the mo&s;t Illu&s;trious Members of that Body are not
mo&s;t re&s;pected: for oftentimes a Gentleman of
three Days &s;tanding is advanc'd to the Dignity of
a <HI>Procurator,</HI> while the Ancient Families, and tho&s;e
that gave a Being to the Republic, are in a mi|&s;erable
Condition. Here, as well as every where
el&s;e, 'tis the Cu&s;tom to wor&s;hip the Ri&s;ing Sun, and
to court tho&s;e who &s;eem to be the Darlings of For|tune:
The Riche&s;t are always e&s;teem'd the Greate&s;t
<PB N="373" REF="210">
Lords, and &s;tand faire&s;t for Preferment. However
&s;ince all Elections are decided by Plurality of Voi|ces
in the Grand Council, the poorer Sort of Gen|tlemen
are treated with more Complai&s;ance than
they cou'd expect, if they had not a Right to
Vote on &s;uch Occa&s;ions; &s;ince it may &s;ometimes be
in their Power to di&s;po&s;e of the Procurator&s;hip,
and even of the Ducal Coronet. This puts me
in mind of a Story, which perhaps will divert
you; you mu&s;t take it on the Credit of its Authors.
There was, &s;ay the <HI>Venetians,</HI> a certain poor Gen|tleman,
who had Occa&s;ion to take a Journey into
the Country: Before his Departure he went to a
Great Lord, who was his Neighbour, and intreat|ed
him to lend him a Cloak; but had the Mor|tification
to receive a flat Denyal, and was forc'd to
have Recour&s;e to another. Not long after the <HI>Doge</HI>
di'd, and the rich Nobleman had &s;o great an Inte|re&s;t
in the Council, that when they proceeded to
Balloting, he wanted but one Voice to be cho&s;en.
In the mean time the poor Gentleman happen'd to
come in, and was immediately acco&s;ted by his
wealthy Neighbour, who, with all imaginable
Submi&s;&s;ion and Re&s;pect, begg'd his Voice; and
a&s;&s;ur'd him, that he wou'd always look upon him
as the Author of his Fortune. But the Gentleman
remembring his late Incivility, reply'd in an
angry and di&s;dainful manner, <HI>No, my Lord, you mu&s;t
e'en re&s;olve to go without a Coronet, as you made me
go without a Cloak.</HI> The Con&s;ideration of the fre|quent
Occa&s;ions they have to make u&s;e of the A&s;&s;i|&s;tance
of the re&s;t of their Body, makes 'em treat
one another with a great deal of <HI>Civility,</HI> if I
may be allow'd to u&s;e &s;o weak an Expre&s;&s;ion to
&s;ignifie the Compliments and Ceremonious Nice|ties
of their Salutations, which are &s;o extravagant,
that in any other Country they wou'd be e&s;teem'd
Ridiculous. 'Tis plea&s;ant to ob&s;erve how they
<PB N="374" REF="211">
court one another when they meet on the <HI>Brog|lio:</HI>
I have often &s;een Noblemen who &s;tood Can|didates
for the highe&s;t Preferments, pro&s;trate them|&s;elves
before a poor Gentleman who&s;e Ve&s;t was
not worth a Groat, as if he had been a King,
or &s;omewhat more than Humane. The <HI>Venetian</HI>
Salutations are quite different from Ours; they
perform 'em &s;lowly, to expre&s;s the Mode&s;ty and
Humility of their Re&s;pect, and bowing their Heads
to their very Knees, continue &s;ometimes for the
Space of a Minute in that Po&s;ture, offering their
Service in the mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Expre&s;&s;ions; after
which they rai&s;e their Bodies, and immediately
begin again, repeating the &s;ame Ceremony two
or three times. And they are &s;o nicely &s;crupu|lous
in &s;uch Ca&s;es, that if any Nobleman &s;hou'd
venture to &s;horten his Reverences, or to imitate
the <HI>French</HI> Air in the lea&s;t, he wou'd be rec|kon'd
a ba&s;e Man, who had lo&s;t all Sen&s;e of
Honour.</P>
<P>When a Stranger comes to &s;erve in the <HI>Venetian</HI>
Army, he mu&s;t immediately learn their Fa&s;hions,
as the only way to avoid their Hatred, and to
rai&s;e his own Fortune; tho' it mu&s;t be acknow|ledg'd
the&s;e fawning Ceremonies are extremely
trouble&s;ome and unea&s;ie. I had occa&s;ion t'other
Day to &s;ee the Entry of a Procurator, and took
notice of &s;ome Colonels and other Officers who
march'd before the Senate to the Church, where
they &s;topt within the Door, and &s;aluted every
Nobleman as he pa&s;s'd by, with a Reverence,
&s;uch as I de&s;crib'd before; &s;o that for a large
Quarter of an Hour they were perpetually em|ploy'd
in that trouble&s;ome Task. But be&s;ides tho&s;e
profound Reverences, there are a Thou&s;and other
Niceties, and nau&s;eous Flatteries, which are the
nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equences of their Exce&s;&s;ive Civili|ty.
You mu&s;t weigh every Expre&s;&s;ion you u&s;e
<PB N="375" REF="211">
either in Letters or Di&s;cour&s;e; for 'tis not enough
to avoid the Word <HI>Voi</HI> or <HI>You,</HI> which wou'd be
reckon'd a Downright Affront, and to u&s;e al|ways
the Third Per&s;on <HI>Lei,</HI> or <HI>Ella,</HI> but you mu&s;t
take care to repeat the mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Phra&s;es,
&s;uch as <HI>If it plea&s;e my Patron, If my Patron vouch&s;afe
to command me,</HI> &amp;c. You mu&s;t &s;till &s;ay, <HI>My Patron</HI>
&s;aid or did &s;uch a thing; and whatever Epithet
you be&s;tow upon him, you mu&s;t never forget to
add <HI>i&s;&s;imo</HI> to the End of it; for 'twou'd be rec|kon'd
a poor Compliment to call a Man <HI>Nobile,
Docto,</HI> or <HI>Galanto,</HI> in&s;tead of which you mu&s;t &s;ay
he is <HI>Nobili&s;&s;imo, Docti&s;&s;imo,</HI> and <HI>Galanti&s;&s;imo.</HI> The
&s;ame, or rather greater Ceremonies, are ob&s;erv'd
in <HI>Writing;</HI> I remember I have &s;een &s;ome Letters
from the Captain Generals <HI>Cornaro</HI> and <HI>Mocenigo</HI> to
a <HI>Greek Merchant,</HI> in which they gave him the Ti|tle
of <HI>Molto Illu&s;tre Signor.</HI> Four Fingers breadth
lower the Letter began thus, <HI>Ho ricevuto de vo&s;tra
Signoria molto Illu&s;tre,</HI> &amp;c. and the re&s;t was all of
a Piece: At the End of the Letter were the&s;e
Words, <HI>de vo&s;tra Signoria molto illu&s;tre, devoti&s;&s;imo
Servitore;</HI> then a Space of Six Fingers breadth,
and the Sub&s;cription at the Bottom. I was ex|tremely
&s;urpriz'd at the Extravagancy of the&s;e
Compliments, when I con&s;ider'd the Quality of
the Writers, and of him to whom the Letters
were directed; and I leave you to judge what
Ceremonies mu&s;t be ob&s;erv'd between Equals. A
Letter to a Nobleman mu&s;t be directed thus,
<HI>Al' Illu&s;tri&s;&s;imo &amp; Excellenti&s;&s;imo Signor, &amp; mio Padrone
Colendi&s;&s;imo, il Signor,</HI> &amp;c. and the Body of the Let|ter
mu&s;t be &s;utable to the flattering Super&s;cripti|on.
You mu&s;t take care to give every Man the
Titles that are appropriated to Per&s;ons of his Rank
and Quality: Thus when you &s;peak to a <HI>Trade&s;|man,</HI>
you mu&s;t call him <HI>Signor Pietro,</HI> or <HI>Signor
Paolo;</HI> to a <HI>Citizen</HI> or <HI>Merchant</HI> you mu&s;t &s;ay <HI>Vo&s;tra
<PB N="376" REF="212">
Signoria,</HI> and, in Letters, <HI>Vo&s;tra Signoria molto Illu|&s;tre.</HI>
A <HI>Coun&s;ellor, Phy&s;ician, Notary,</HI> or a <HI>Gentleman</HI>
who is a <HI>Subject</HI> is &s;tyl'd <HI>la Signoria Illu&s;tri&s;&s;ima;</HI>
The proper Title of the <HI>Nobles</HI> is <HI>l' Excellenza;</HI>
and the <HI>Doge</HI> is u&s;ually call'd <HI>la Serenita,</HI> or <HI>il
Sereni&s;&s;imo;</HI> for they rarely &s;ay <HI>il Dogio.</HI> But when
they &s;ay <HI>il Principe,</HI> they always mean the <HI>Re|public.</HI>
Thus all Orders and Proclamations begin
thus, <HI>Il Sereni&s;&s;imo Principe fa &s;apere; The mo&s;t Serene
Prince declares, or gives Notice:</HI> And tis u&s;ually &s;aid
in familiar Di&s;cour&s;e, <HI>Il Principe ha prohibito le Pom|pe;
The Prince has prohibited the wearing of Co&s;tly Appa|rel,</HI>
&amp;c. Thus they &s;peak when they do not &s;o
much as think of the <HI>Doge,</HI> who has no more
Power to make &s;uch Regulations, than the mean|e&s;t
Officer that belongs to the Republic; and far
from being a Soveraign, he is &s;o much a Sub|ject,
that he dares hardly move one Inch with|out
Orders. <HI>Francis Moro&s;ini,</HI> the pre&s;ent <HI>Doge,</HI>
was elected to that Dignity in <HI>April</HI> 1688, while
he was obtaining Victories for the Republick abroad.
And yet as told and infirmas he is, he was forc'd to
continue in that fatiguing Employment, and at la&s;t,
with much ado, and after a whole Year &s;pent
in humble and earne&s;t Solicitations, he obtain'd
leave to quit the Service, and return'd to <HI>Venice</HI>
la&s;t Year. He is the fir&s;t <HI>Doge</HI> that ever enter'd
the City with the Ducal Coronet on his Head:
Nor cou'd the Senate refu&s;e to grant &s;ome unu|&s;ual
Mark of Honour to the Conqueror of all
<HI>Morea.</HI> However, I'm &s;trongly inclin'd to &s;u&s;pect
that the main Con&s;ideration which made him &s;o
unea&s;ie till he had obtain'd a Permi&s;&s;ion to leave
the Army, was his Fear of lo&s;ing the Glory he
had acquir'd. And you will be of the &s;ame O|pinion
if you con&s;ider the ill Succe&s;s of his At|tempt
upon <HI>Negropont;</HI> and the &s;low Progre&s;s he
made in the Siege of <HI>Napoli di Malva&s;ia,</HI> which
<PB N="377" REF="212">
held out two Years again&s;t him, and was &s;till in
&s;o good a Condition at his Departure, that there
was little or no hope of reducing it; tho' for want
of Provi&s;ions the Garri&s;on was oblig'd to &s;urren|der
the Place to the General during the la&s;t
Campaign.</P>
<P>The length of this Siege puts me in mind of
<HI>Candy,</HI> which for &s;o long a time was attack'd and
defended with equal Ob&s;tinacy and Vigour. 'Twas
the &s;ame <HI>Moro&s;ini</HI> who commanded in the Place,
and the Senate being unwilling to wa&s;te &s;o much
Blood and Trea&s;ure in the Defence of a Place
which, after all, they cou'd not hope to pre&s;erve,
&s;ent him po&s;itive Orders to Capitulate. But he
was &s;o de&s;irous of Glory, and had &s;o mean an
Opinion of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Valour, that he a&s;&s;ur'd
the Senate, if they wou'd continue to &s;upply
him with nece&s;&s;ary Provi&s;ions, he wou'd either
&s;ave the Place, or bury him&s;elf under its Ruines.
Yet, for all his bravery, he was forc'd to &s;ubmit
to the Chance of War, without performing ei|ther
part of his Promi&s;e: And at his return to
<HI>Venice</HI> he had the mortification to meet with a ve|ry
bad Reception on the <HI>Broglio.</HI> Some of the No|bles
were &s;o incens'd again&s;t him, that they di&s;|cover'd
their Spite by abu&s;ing him to his Face,
asking by way of Deri&s;ion, <HI>Ha! is not this</HI> Moro|&s;ini;
while others reply'd with equal Bitterne&s;s
and Contempt, <HI>No, no, that can't be the Man who
promis'd to bury him&s;elf under the Ruines of</HI> Candy, <HI>if
he &s;hou'd find him&s;elf unable to pre&s;erve it.</HI> But the Ma|lice
of his Enemies did not evaporate in Je&s;ts,
they were not &s;atisfy'd with &s;o poor a Revenge,
but pro&s;ecuted him &s;o warmly, that his Head was
in a tottering Condition. One of 'em repre&s;ent|ed
his Crime to the Council, and in a vehement
and pathetic Di&s;cour&s;e, accus'd him of abu&s;ing the
Senate, by promi&s;ing &s;uch things as he cou'd not
<PB N="378" REF="213">
perform, and of engaging the Republick in a pro|digious
Charge, which might have been better
employ'd another way. Nor was this the &s;ingle
Opinion of one Per&s;on, for &s;everal others voted
him guilty: Yet his good Fortune deliver'd him
from &s;o great a Danger, and has now &s;et the Co|ronet
on his Head; he is &s;omewhat lean, and of
a middle Stature; his Hair and Beard are white;
he wears Whiskers, and a little Tuft of Hair up|on
his Chin. I &s;aw him at the Entry of his
Kin&s;man the Procurator <HI>Moro&s;ini;</HI> and &s;ince I have
occa&s;ion again to &s;peak of that Solemnity, which
I only mention'd before, I &s;hall now give you a
particular Account of it: But before I de&s;cribe
the Order of the Cavalcade, it will not be im|proper
to acquaint you with the Preparations
that were made in the Church of S. <HI>Mark.</HI></P>
<P>From the Door of the Nave or Body of the
Church to that of the Quire, there was a Lane
border'd with Rows of Benches, thro' which the
<HI>Doge</HI> and Procurators were to pa&s;s; and both the
Floor and Benches were cover'd with <HI>Turki&s;h Tape&s;try.</HI>
The Quire was al&s;o full of Benches, without any
Difference or Mark of Di&s;tinction; only the <HI>Doge</HI>'s
Place was cover'd with red Velvet; and be&s;ides,
there was a Cu&s;hion of the &s;ame Velvet at his
Feet, and another on the Place where he lean'd
at Prayer. The Altar was embelli&s;h'd with the
riche&s;t Jewels, Relicks, Candle&s;ticks, and other Or|naments;
and the Patiarch's great Vicar waited
in his Seat for the <HI>Doge</HI>'s coming. He wore a
Cha&s;uble embroider'd with Pearls, worth above
6000 <HI>Ducats;</HI> and the Hangings of the Altar
were no le&s;s rich.</P>
<P>The Church being thus prepar'd, the Signiory
or Noblemen began their Cavalcade from the Hall
of the Great Council in S. <HI>Mark</HI>'s Palace, where
they were a&s;&s;embl'd to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the Solemnity.
<PB N="379" REF="213">
In the fir&s;t place march'd the <HI>Doge</HI>'s Servants, to
the Number of Forty, in long Livery Cloaks.
Then came the Societies of Trade&s;men, or rather
a confus'd Company of private Per&s;ons who came
of their own accord to honour the new Procu|rator;
for their Pre&s;ence was not requir'd by
any po&s;itive Order. The&s;e were follow'd by a
Hundred <HI>Sclavonian</HI> Soldiers, arm'd only with Sa|bres,
who had obtain'd leave to come from the
Army, and appear'd on this Occa&s;ion at the de&s;ire
of their Commanders. Twelve or Fifteen Offi|cers
march'd before 'em, among whom was a Ser|geant
Major; and there were &s;ome al&s;o in the
Rear. The&s;e Officers were not arm'd, becau&s;e
they came voluntarily, not by command; for at
<HI>Venice</HI> every Man is welcome on &s;uch Occa&s;ions,
tho' he be not invited. Then came the Eight
Standards of the Republick, Two <HI>Red,</HI> Two <HI>White,</HI>
Two <HI>Blue,</HI> and Two of a <HI>Violet-colour;</HI> the <HI>Red</HI> being
carry'd fir&s;t, to &s;ignifie the pre&s;ent War. The&s;e
were immediately follow'd by the Signiory, who
march'd Two and Two, in open-&s;leev'd Gowns,
or Robes of <HI>Red</HI> Cloth furr'd with Ermines. There
were at lea&s;t Three hundred Nobles, comprehen|ding
the Senators and the Procurators, who
form'd the la&s;t Ranks, and con&s;equently were
next the <HI>Doge.</HI> He that made his Entry walk'd
among the re&s;t, without any Mark of Di&s;tincti|on
either in his Habit, or any other Re&s;pect;
&s;o that if &s;ome Per&s;ons had not &s;hew'd him to
to me, I cou'd not have di&s;tingui&s;h'd him from
the re&s;t of the Procurators. The Robes or Gowns
of all the Procurators are exactly alike; nor is
there any difference among the Nobles in re&s;pect
of their Habits; that &s;o none may pretend to Su|periority
over another. After them came the
<HI>Doge,</HI> who repre&s;ents the Soveraign: He had a
Ve&s;t of Red Brocado, with Gold Flowers, and
<PB N="380" REF="214">
over that a Duc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters"> Mantle, of a very rich
Stuff of Gold. His Coronet is a Cap of Pa&s;t|board
neatly cover'd with the &s;ame rich Stuff,
and adorn'd with &s;ome Galoons, without either
Pearls or Precious Stones. There is a &s;ort of
Point on the hinder part of the Cap, that bends
a little forwards. The magnificent Coronet that
is kept in the Trea&s;ury, is only us'd on the Day of
the <HI>Doge</HI>'s Coronation. He was accompany'd on the
Right-hand by the Pope's <HI>Nuncio,</HI> and on the Left
by the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, <HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Haye.</HI>
The fir&s;t was in a Camail and Rochet, and the
other in a black Cloak. Two Citizens bore the
<HI>Doge</HI>'s Train, which otherwi&s;e wou'd have trail'd
above four Feet on the Ground. La&s;t of all
march'd Fifty or Sixty Nobles, in the &s;ame Or|der
as before. As the Noblemen pa&s;s'd by, there
were certain old and young Women that &s;trew'd
the Way with Flowers and Green Leaves, e&s;pe|cially
before the <HI>Doge:</HI> In the mean time the
Guns at the Ar&s;enal were fir'd, and the Compa|ny
was entertain'd with the Noi&s;e of the Prince's
Trumpets and Kettle-Drums, which were plac'd
on the Top of the Portico of the Church, be|tween
the two Brazen Hor&s;es, from whence they
might be ea&s;ily heard, becau&s;e 'tis not Three hun|dred
Paces from thence to the Hall of the Great
Council. As &s;oon as the <HI>Doge</HI> enter'd, he
went immediately to perform his Devotions upon
the Steps of the Altar, where he kneel'd without
a Cu&s;hion. As he return'd to his Place, the <HI>Nun|cio</HI>
happen'd to be on his Left-hand, and the
Amba&s;&s;ador on his Right, but they in&s;tantly
chang'd Places, and proceeded as before to the
Place where the <HI>Doge</HI> was to &s;it. After the <HI>Doge</HI>
had &s;eated him&s;elf, the <HI>Nuncio</HI> &s;ate down on his
Right-hand, and <HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Haye</HI> took his
Place on the Right-hand of the <HI>Nuncio;</HI> &s;o that
<PB N="381" REF="214">
the <HI>Nuncio</HI> &s;ate between the <HI>Doge</HI> and the Am|ba&s;&s;ador.
This prepo&s;terous Order will perhaps
&s;urprize you; for according to the Ceremonies
that are ob&s;erv'd on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, the <HI>Doge</HI>
ought to have &s;ate in the Middle: But I had
forgot to tell you, that there was no particular
Place appointed for the <HI>Doge,</HI> neither a Tribune,
Pew, nor &s;o much as an arm'd Chair; &s;o that
he was forc'd to make u&s;e of the Seat that be|longs
to the Dean of the Canons, which is the
fir&s;t on the Right-hand next the Door of the
Quire. The re&s;t of the Seats in the &s;ame Row
were fill'd by the Procurators and Senators; &s;o
that the <HI>Doge</HI> had only the fir&s;t Place among the
Senators, without any other Mark of Di&s;tinction
than the red Velvet with which his Seat was
cover'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Doge</HI>'s Behaviour during the Ma&s;s was not
very edifying, for he &s;pent the whole time in
di&s;cour&s;ing with the <HI>Nuncio</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> Am|ba&s;&s;ador,
and expre&s;s'd a great deal of Earne&s;tne&s;s
by his Actions. Tho' I cou'd not pretend to
divine the Subject of his Di&s;cour&s;e, I cou'd ea&s;ily
perceive that he talk'd of &s;ome important Affair;
for <HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Haye</HI> ro&s;e from his Place, and
talk'd with him above a quarter of an Hour,
chu&s;ing rather to &s;tand while the <HI>Nuncio</HI> &s;ate, and
to turn his Back to the Altar, than to lo&s;e the
Opportunity of imparting &s;omething with which, in
all probability, he long'd to entertain him. After the
Ma&s;s was ended, the <HI>Doge</HI> and Nobles return'd
in the &s;ame Order as before, to the Palace of
S. <HI>Mark,</HI> where they were regal'd by the New
Procurator with a &s;plendid Collation of <HI>Wax,</HI> for
&s;o it might be properly call'd, &s;ince mo&s;t of the
Di&s;hes contain'd nothing el&s;e. The whole Table
was cover'd with Trophies, Confections, Turky-Cocks,
Partridges, and Fruits repre&s;ented in Wax,
<PB N="382" REF="215">
excepting two or three Places where there were
Di&s;hes of good and delicious Victuals: For the
<HI>Italian</HI> Cooks are at lea&s;t as skilful as ours. I ne|ver
&s;aw People eat more heartily than the&s;e Gen|tlemen,
and I'm apt to believe that their Cu|&s;tom
of &s;erving up the Di&s;hes &s;ingly might &s;harpen
their Appetite; for 'tis certain that the very &s;ight
of a full Table cloys the Stomach. Yet I cou'd
not forbear telling one of the Company, that
this manner of Entertainment, and e&s;pecially the
Fea&s;t of Trophies was very odd and ridiculous: But
the Per&s;on to whom I addre&s;t my &s;elf, made a &s;hift
to an&s;wer my Objection by pretending that they
ob&s;erv'd this Method to avoid the trouble of co|vering
&s;o large a Table &s;everal times, which cou'd not
be done without Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>That and the two following Days were &s;pent
in rejoycing; The Streets were full of People in
Ma&s;querade, and the Merchants expos'd their rich|e&s;t
Commodities. There was nothing to be &s;een
in the Shops but Brocado's of Gold and Silver,
Galoons, Fringes, and Ribbons; Sonnets in Ho|nour
of the Procurator were &s;catter'd about by
Thou&s;ands, and Prints of him every where hung
out. At Night there were great Illuminations at
his Palace, and at that of S. <HI>Mark;</HI> and the
whole City in the general &s;eem'd to be full of
Joy; tho' 'tis certain the Pomp wou'd have been
much greater if the Magi&s;trates, to whom the Re|gulation
of &s;uch Ceremonies does properly be|long,
had not publi&s;h'd an Order three Days be|fore,
to moderate the Expence of the Solemnity:
For otherwi&s;e the whole City wou'd have been
illuminated, the Ladies wou'd have adorn'd them|&s;elves
with Pearls and Jewels, all the Lacqueys
wou'd have appear'd in Liveries, and the Canal
wou'd have been cover'd with magnificent <HI>Gon|dola's,</HI>
embelli&s;h'd with Flaggs and Streamers, and
<PB N="383" REF="215">
fill'd with Con&s;orts of Mu&s;ick. Be&s;ides the Pro|curator's
Friends wou'd have &s;ignaliz'd their Joy
in a particular manner, by Fea&s;ts, Illuminations,
and Fire-Works: But all this Pageantry was pre|vented
by a po&s;itive Order from the above-menti|on'd
Tribunal. At the &s;ame time, another Edict
was publi&s;h'd, which concerns all Per&s;ons in gene|ral,
and is only a Repetition of tho&s;e Regulations
that were formerly made on &s;uch Occa&s;ions. By
this la&s;t Order all <HI>Venetians,</HI> whether Nobles
or Citizens, are prohibited to wear any &s;ort of
Stuff, embroider'd Fringe or Galoon, of Gold, Sil|ver,
Steel, or any thing that &s;hines or ca&s;ts a Lu|&s;tre.
The &s;ame Edict forbids Lace, new Fa&s;hi|ons
of Cloaths, Liveries, and the Painting or
Adorning of <HI>Gondola's;</HI> and re&s;trains the Women
from u&s;ing Gold or Silver Ribbons, and from wear|ing
above three Rows of Fringes or Lace on their
Pettycoats, and even tho&s;e Ornaments mu&s;t only
be worn on the Fore-part of the Pettycoat. But
tho&s;e who are call'd Novices are allow'd, during
the two fir&s;t Years of their Noviciate, to wear a
String of Pearls, and a Gold Fringe about their
Pettycoats. The Novices are &s;uch as are newly
married.</P>
<P>All Strangers are excus'd from complying with
this Order for &s;ix Months after the Day of their
Arrival; but a&s;&s;oon as that time is expir'd, they
mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the Cu&s;tom as well as the Natives,
unle&s;s they belong to the Retinue of an Amba&s;&s;a|dour;
tho' Offences of this Nature are rarely
puni&s;h'd.</P>
<P>When I con&s;ider the extreme Eagerne&s;s with
which the Noble <HI>Venetians</HI> contend for the Ducal
Dignity, I cannot forbear reflecting on the Weak|ne&s;s
of Humane Nature, which expo&s;es us to the
mo&s;t fatal Delu&s;ions, and prompts us to court the
dazzling Appearances of Grandeur, tho' we are
<PB N="384" REF="216">
convinc'd of the Vanity of that Enjoyment in
which we &s;eem to place our Happine&s;s. For, in
my Opinion, the Condition of a &s;imple <HI>Senatour</HI> is
infinitely more happy than that of the <HI>Doge.</HI>
He is permitted to enjoy the Plea&s;ure of Walk|ing,
to vi&s;it his Friends, and to go to the <HI>Opera</HI>
and <HI>Ridotti.</HI> He is not perpetually watch'd, and
haunted Night and Day by a Multitude of Spies,
under the Name of Coun&s;ellours; nor is he ob|lig'd
to give an exact Account of his Actions. But
the <HI>Doge</HI> is a gawdy Slave loaded with Fetters,
which are not the le&s;s heavy becau&s;e they are gilded:
And his Authority extends no farther, than to no|minate
&s;ome Officers of the Palace, and to create
&s;ome <HI>Knights of S. Mark.</HI></P>
<P>This Order of Knighthood may be divided into
three <HI>Cla&s;&s;es</HI> or Ranks. The <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> comprehends the
<HI>Knights of the Golden Star,</HI> who are all Noble <HI>Vene|ians,</HI>
that owe their Dignity to their Merit, and
wear a <HI>Star</HI> border'd with a Gold Galoon. The
<HI>Second</HI> Rank con&s;i&s;ts of the <HI>Knights of S. Mark,</HI>
who are call'd <HI>Knights of the Senate:</HI> And this Ho|nour
is u&s;ually conferr'd as a Recompence, on Co|lonels,
and even &s;ometimes on Captains, who have
&s;ignaliz'd their Bravery in an extraordinary man|ner,
or render'd &s;ome important Services to the
Republic. The Captain-General recommends
the Per&s;on to the Senate, who, if the Bal|loting
run in his Favour, receives the Order, and
with it a Pen&s;ion of at lea&s;t a Thou&s;and Ducats
a Year. The&s;e Knights wear a Medal at one of
their Button-holes, with the Figure of S. <HI>Mark</HI>
on one Side, and a Device on the Rever&s;e, ac|cording
to the Plea&s;ure of the Senate. They are
honour'd with the Title of <HI>Illu&s;tri&s;&s;imo,</HI> and are much
re&s;pected: but the Dignity is indifferently be&s;tow'd
upon all, whether Noble or Ignoble, <HI>Venetians</HI> or
Foreigners. The <HI>Third</HI> and la&s;t Rank is made up
<PB N="385" REF="216">
of the <HI>Doge's Knights,</HI> who confers the Honour
on whom he plea&s;es, and oftentimes on tho&s;e
who never wore a Sword; for any Man may
purcha&s;e the Title of <HI>Illu&s;tri&s;&s;imo</HI> at the Rate of a
Hundred <HI>Sequins,</HI> which, if I am not mi&s;taken,
is the u&s;ual Price of this Dignity. Yet notwith|&s;tanding
the Lowne&s;s of the Rate, the <HI>Doge</HI> finds
but few Cu&s;tomers; for the <HI>Italians</HI> are not over|fond
of &s;o unprofitable Honour. So that this <HI>Cla&s;&s;is</HI>
of Knights con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of Foreign Officers, who
receive &s;ome Benefit by the Title; &s;ince it not
only procures 'em a more than ordinary Re&s;pect,
but confirms 'em in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their Em|ployments.</P>
<P>Since the mentioning of the&s;e Officers puts me in
mind of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Army, I &s;hall take this Occa|&s;ion
to give you &s;ome Account of the Forces
that are maintain'd by the Republick. The total
Number of the Soldiers both at Land and Sea,
hardly amounts to Four and twenty thou&s;and; and
of the&s;e there are u&s;ually Twelve or Fifteen thou|&s;and
in the Field. The <HI>Captain-General,</HI> who com|mands
'em, is always a Noble <HI>Venetian,</HI> and has
under him a <HI>General of the Land-Forces, Lieutenant-Generals,</HI>
and <HI>Sergeant-Majors,</HI> who are almo&s;t al|always
Foreigners; for the Noble <HI>Venetians</HI> are not
very ambitious of Military Employments. 'Tis
true, they cannot be accus'd of Want of Cou|rage;
but &s;ince a Soldier mu&s;t &s;erve his Appren|tice&s;hip
with his Mu&s;quet on his Shoulder, be|fore
he can attain to any Perfection in his Art,
they cannot endure to think of &s;tooping &s;o low:
and even there is hardly one of 'em that wou'd not
think it beneath him to accept a Captain's Com|mi&s;&s;ion.
The <HI>Soldiers</HI> are for the mo&s;t part Fo|reigners,
as well as the <HI>Generals;</HI> for, except three
or four &s;mall <HI>Italian</HI> Regiments, which are not
much e&s;teem'd, the re&s;t of the Army con&s;i&s;ts ei|ther
<PB N="386" REF="217">
of <HI>Germans,</HI> or <HI>Frenchmen,</HI> whom they call <HI>Tra|montani.</HI>
The Pay of Foreigners is double to that
which is allow'd to the <HI>Italians;</HI> and no Captain mu&s;t
receive a Soldier of another Nation into his Compa|ny,
under Pain of being ca&s;hier'd without Remi&s;&s;ion.
But the &s;ame Order is not ob&s;erv'd in the <HI>Italian</HI>
Regiments, for any Man may be admitted to
&s;erve in 'em. And &s;ince the Foreign Captains
wou'd be at a Lo&s;s for want of Men, the Re|public
takes care to &s;upply 'em with Recruits:
Only they mu&s;t be very cautious in preventing
the De&s;ertion of their Men; for when a Compa|ny
is extremely dimini&s;h'd, the Captain is always
<HI>reform'd,</HI> and the Soldiers &s;erve to recruit the re&s;t
of the Regiment. I know &s;everal Officers, who
lo&s;t their Places by Misfortunes of this Nature;
which &s;ometimes cannot be avoided, e&s;pecially a|mong
the <HI>French,</HI> who de&s;ert by Hundreds at a
time. If it were not for this only Inconvenien|cy,
I &s;hou'd have a very good Opinion of the
<HI>Venetian</HI> Service; for a Foreign <HI>Captain</HI> has no le&s;s
than a <HI>Hundred</HI> Ducats a Month, which makes
<HI>Two hundred and fifty French</HI> Livres; a <HI>Lieutenant</HI> has
<HI>Thirty,</HI> and an <HI>En&s;ign Twenty five.</HI> Be&s;ides there
is not a Place in the World where a Soldier has
a nearer Pro&s;pect of Advancement; for &s;ince the
Army is not very Numerous, and the Noble <HI>Ve|netians</HI>
never pretend to Military Preferments, a
Stranger has a fair Opportunity of rai&s;ing his For|tune:
So that a <HI>Captain</HI> mu&s;t either be extreme|ly
unfortunate, or negligent in the Performance
of his Duty, if his Service be not rewarded with
a <HI>Colonel</HI>'s Commi&s;&s;ion, or even with more con|&s;iderable
Preferment. The Army is full of <HI>Sergeant-Majors,</HI>
who owe their Fortune meerly to their
Merit; and there is no Po&s;t &s;o high which a
brave Man may not in time hope to obtain. 'Tis
a wonderful Encouragement to a Young A&s;pirer,
<PB N="387" REF="217">
to &s;ee daily &s;o many Examples that flatter and ex|cite
his Ambition. Be&s;ides their travelling by
Sea frees 'em from the Charge of providing an
Equipage; which is a great Advantage to tho&s;e
who are not over-&s;tock'd with Money. Add to
the&s;e Conveniencies the free and uncon&s;train'd Way
of living <HI>a-la-mode de Venice;</HI> and it mu&s;t be ac|knowledg'd,
that a Man may ea&s;ily chu&s;e a le&s;s com|fortable
Employment. I know the World has ge|nerally
&s;o bad an Opinion of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Service,
that 'tis u&s;ually the la&s;t Refuge of tho&s;e who are
reduc'd to Extremity: Nor am I ignorant that
the Officers are not here on the &s;ame Foot
as in <HI>France,</HI> and that the meane&s;t Scoundrels find
Admittance; but, after all, the Service is not
really le&s;s advantageous for the&s;e Inconvenien|cies.</P>
<P>But, as for the Common Soldiers, their Condi|tion
is &s;o mi&s;erable, that I wou'd rather chu&s;e to
&s;erve a Tinker, than to carry a Mu&s;quet at <HI>Ve|nice.</HI>
Their Pay amounts to no more than <HI>Three
Pence</HI> a Day; and be&s;ides they mu&s;t furni&s;h their
own Clothes. Judge then what Provi&s;ion they
can make for their Bellies, and whether their
De&s;ertion can be reckon'd a Fault. Tho&s;e who
&s;erve at Sea have the &s;ame Pay, and Clothes in|to
the Bargain; but they mu&s;t buy their Provi&s;i|ons,
for they are allow'd only Bread and Water.
There are <HI>Eleven</HI> Ships belonging to the Republic,
commanded by the <HI>Captain-General;</HI> for there is
no <HI>Admiral.</HI> But be&s;ides the little Care that is ta|ken
to keep 'em in Repair, they are &s;o defective
in all Re&s;pects, that they hardly de&s;erve the Name
of <HI>Ships,</HI> much le&s;s of <HI>Men of War.</HI> In every Ship
there is a Noble <HI>Venetian,</HI> with the Title of <HI>Com|mander,</HI>
who pehaps never &s;aw a Ma&s;t before his
coming on Board: but he has under him a <HI>Cap|tain,</HI>
whom he con&s;ults, or rather &s;uffers to com|mand.
<PB N="388" REF="218">
The&s;e Captains (who are u&s;ually old and
expert Pilots) have <HI>Thirty</HI> Ducats a Month be&s;ides
their Entertainment; and may in time be ad|vanc'd
to the Command of a Merchant-Ship, if
the Owners think fit to tru&s;t 'em. The <HI>Ban|ner</HI>
of <HI>Venice</HI> is <HI>Red,</HI> with a <HI>Lyon</HI> in the Middle,
holding an open <HI>Book</HI> in one of his Paws, with
the&s;e Words, <HI>Pax tibi, Marce, Evangeli&s;ta meus.</HI>
Many take this <HI>Lyon</HI> for the <HI>Arms</HI> of <HI>Venice,</HI> but
they are extremely mi&s;taken; for the <HI>Republic</HI> has
no Coat of Arms, and wou'd be loth to adorn
a Scutcheon with that Sacred Bea&s;t, whom they
honour as an Emblem of S. <HI>Mark,</HI> or rather that
Evangeli&s;t him&s;elf repre&s;ented under the Figure
of a <HI>Lyon.</HI> I knew that Painters u&s;ually give that
Saint a <HI>Lyon</HI> for his Companion; but I cou'd
not believe that the <HI>Venetian Lyon</HI> was the <HI>Saint</HI>
him&s;elf, till I was convinc'd by the repeated Af|firmations
of &s;everal credible Per&s;ons, and even
of &s;ome Noblemen; who, to &s;atisfie my Scruples,
told me the following Story.</P>
<P>S. <HI>Mark</HI> was a Youth of &s;uch exqui&s;ite Beauty,
that his only Si&s;ter fell &s;o de&s;perately in Love
with him, that notwith&s;tanding all his Holy Ad|monitions,
&s;he haunted him Night and Day, fol|low'd
him whither&s;oever he went, and continu|ally
begg'd him to &s;atisfie her Pa&s;&s;ion. At la&s;t
the young Saint perceiving that all his Severity
cou'd not extingui&s;h her Criminal Flame, be&s;ought
God to transform him into the mo&s;t hideous
Creature in the World. His Prayer was grant|ed,
and he was in&s;tantly turn'd to a <HI>Lyon,</HI> who&s;e
gaping Mouth, and horrid Roaring, &s;o terrify'd his
Si&s;ter, that immediately &s;he fell upon her Knees,
pray'd to God to forgive her, and was convert|ed.
The <HI>Open Book</HI> he holds in his Talons, re|pre&s;ents
the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> of which they pretend to
have the Original in the Trea&s;ury; and the
<PB N="389" REF="218">
Words that are written in it are the &s;ame with
which <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;aluted him when he came to vi&s;it him
in Pri&s;on.</P>
<P>Perhaps you'll think that this Story de&s;erves a
place in <HI>Ovid</HI>'s <HI>Metamorpho&s;es;</HI> but I can a&s;&s;ure
you the <HI>Venetians</HI> are oblig'd to believe it, under
Pain of being accounted <HI>Hereticks.</HI> Sometimes they
repre&s;ent him with, and &s;ometimes without Wings,
but they &s;eldom or never forget to draw Rays
about his Head; and very often the <HI>Doge</HI> is
painted kneeling before him. At lea&s;t he is
thus repre&s;ented in all the mo&s;t remarkable Pla|ces,
&s;uch as the Front of the Palace of S.
<HI>Mark,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I'm &s;en&s;ible I have already detain'd you too
long, but I mu&s;t not fini&s;h my Letter before I
have fini&s;h'd the Account I promis'd to give you
of the <HI>Venetian Nobles.</HI> I had form'd &s;o &s;trange
an Idea from the Character I had receiv'd of 'em,
that I look'd upon 'em as the mo&s;t Haughty and
Ill-natur'd Men in the World. And even a Fa|mous
Author has the Confidence to affirm that
one of their u&s;ual Recreations is to affront Stran|gers
who &s;eem to be Per&s;ons of Note; thru&s;ting 'em
into the Canal as they walk along the Streets,
&s;pitting upon 'em at the <HI>Opera,</HI> beating 'em with
flaming Torches, and hiring <HI>Bravo's</HI> to murder
'em. Yet to do Ju&s;tice to that Illu&s;trious Body,
I can a&s;&s;ure you, that I never met with more
civil and obliging Per&s;ons in the World. I have
the Honour to know two or three of 'em, and
perceive daily &s;o many con&s;picuous Marks of good
Nature in all their Actions, that I cannot, with|out
Indignation, reflect on the Impudence of tho&s;e
who have &s;o unju&s;tly blacken'd their Character.
'Tis true, they take Care to maintain the Ho|nour
of their Birth, and their Authority over the
Citizens and the re&s;t of their Subjects: but they
<PB N="390" REF="219">
are &s;o far from in&s;ulting or tyrannizing over
'em, that they are always ready to grant their
Protection to hone&s;t Men; and as for Strangers,
there is not a City in the World where they meet
with a kinder and more civil Entertainment.
They may do what they plea&s;e, for no Man ei|ther
enquires into, or comments upon their Acti|ons;
and when they meet with a Nobleman, they
are treated with all imaginable Marks of Honour
and Civility. There are &s;everal <HI>Coffee-Hou&s;es</HI> under
the <HI>Procuraties,</HI> &s;ome of which are &s;et apart for
the Nobility; and that Order is &s;o &s;trictly ob&s;erv'd
that a Citizen never enters into 'em. But if a
Foreigner, who has the Appearance of a Gentle|man,
go in to one of the&s;e Places, all the No|bles
that are there begin immediately to care&s;s
him; and there is not one of 'em who wou'd not
willingly embrace the Offer of his Acquaintance,
provided he belongs not to the Retinue of an
<HI>Amba&s;&s;ador:</HI> for they are &s;everely prohibited by
the Laws of the State to entertain any corre&s;pon|dence
with &s;uch Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Bravo's,</HI> I will not pretend to af|firm
that <HI>Venice</HI> was never plagu'd with tho&s;e
barbarous and inhuman Murderers. It mu&s;t be
acknowledg'd that the Senate tolerated the&s;e Abu|&s;es
too long: There was a time when &s;ome No|bles
kept Fifteen or Twenty o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> tho&s;e Ruffians;
and there were others who were &s;till ready to
&s;erve any Man in their Way, that is, for &s;o ma|ny
<HI>Sequins</HI> wou'd agree to kill a Man, or to break
his Arms for &s;uch a Number of <HI>Ducats.</HI> But the
Face of Affairs is wonderfully chang'd &s;ince that
time, and &s;o va&s;t a Number of tho&s;e Villains
have ended their Lives either on a <HI>Gibbet,</HI> or in
the <HI>Galleys,</HI> that the Race of 'em &s;eems to be quite
extinct. The <HI>Shirts</HI> of <HI>Mail</HI> that were &s;old in
tho&s;e Days for <HI>Fifty Pi&s;toles</HI> a-piece, are now &s;old
<PB N="391" REF="219">
for <HI>half a Crown</HI> to Fi&s;hermen, who u&s;e 'em for
catching Oy&s;ters: For the&s;e Cautions, that were
once thought &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for preventing &s;ecret A&s;|&s;a&s;&s;inations,
are now become &s;o u&s;ele&s;s, that one
may walk as &s;ecure thro' the City by Night as
by Day, and during the <HI>Carnaval</HI> as in <HI>Lent:</HI> At
lea&s;t I have not yet heard of any Di&s;ord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rs &s;ince
my Arrival. On the contrary, I &s;hou'd never de|&s;ire
to conver&s;e with a more harmle&s;s and peace|able
People; and if there are any In&s;olencies com|mitted,
I &s;hou'd rather accu&s;e the <HI>French</HI> as the
Authors of 'em, who in this, as well as in all other
Places, a&s;&s;ume tho&s;e Liberties by which they affect
to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves from other Nations. On|ly
I wou'd not advi&s;e any Man to hunt too bold|ly
in a Nobleman's Inclo&s;ure; for 'tis certain that
there is none of 'em &s;o Complai&s;ant as to &s;ee his
Wife ki&s;s'd, without re&s;enting the Affront, and
that notwith&s;tanding the &s;eeming Extirpation of
the <HI>Bravo's,</HI> the injur'd Nobleman wou'd quickly
find a &s;ufficient Number of 'em to execute his
Revenge. Their Jealou&s;ie is accompany'd with &s;o
implacable a Fury, that they wou'd rather ruine
them&s;elves and their whole Family, than &s;uffer a
bold Intruder into their &s;ecret Delights to e&s;cape
unpuni&s;h'd; and after they had &s;acrific'd the Lo|ver
to their Rage, they wou'd infallibly compleat
their Revenge by the Death of her who betray'd
'em. Such Accidents have &s;ometimes happen'd,
and 'tis to be ob&s;erv'd, that in &s;uch Ca&s;es the Se|nate
never enquires into the Murder. For every
Nobleman may poi&s;on his Wife for Adultery, and
cau&s;e her Gallant to be poniarded, without fear|ing
to be call'd in que&s;tion for &s;o bloody a Re|venge;
&s;ince 'tis &s;uppos'd that no Man wou'd have
recour&s;e to &s;uch violent Methods, if he were not
fully convinc'd of his Wife's Infidelity. I confe&s;s
this way of &s;atisfying their Revenge &s;eems at fir&s;t
<PB N="392" REF="220">
View to be extremely ba&s;e and unworthy of a Man
of Honour: But you will be the le&s;s &s;urpriz'd at their
manner of Proceeding in the&s;e Ca&s;es, if you con|&s;ider
that, notwith&s;tanding their Nobility, 'tis not
their Profe&s;&s;ion to bear Arms. For they are as
much <HI>Men of the Gown</HI> as the <HI>Pre&s;idents</HI> of the <HI>Par|liament</HI>
at <HI>Paris;</HI> and are therefore under a &s;ort
of Obligation to ab&s;tain from Duels. Neverthe|le&s;s
&s;ince 'tis not ju&s;t that they &s;hou'd tamely &s;uf|fer
them&s;elves to be Cuckolded, they mu&s;t exe|cute
their Vengeance by Proxy, &s;ince their Pro|fe&s;&s;ion
re&s;trains em from making their own Hands
the In&s;truments of their Revenge.</P>
<P>I &s;hall in the next place give you a &s;hort Ac|count
of their <HI>Habit:</HI> They wear a black Gown
exactly like that of a <HI>Minime Friar;</HI> only 'tis
longer, wider, and open before; the Sleeves are
&s;o big that they hang down almo&s;t to the Ground,
and they have a little Collar or Neckband like
that which is us'd by the <HI>Je&s;uites.</HI> In the Win|ter
their Gowns are lin'd with a greyi&s;h Fur,
which reaches a hands-breadth beyond the Cloth,
all along the Brea&s;t, and are ty'd about with a
Leathern-Girdle, adorn'd with Silver Buckles and
Bo&s;&s;es. In Summer they u&s;e neither Girdles nor
Furrs; for they wear their Ve&s;ts loo&s;e by rea&s;on of
the Heat, and line 'em with very thin Taffata:
But they &s;till wear Cloth Gowns of the &s;ame big|ne&s;s
as in Winter. On their Shoulders they wear
a &s;ort of Bag or Hood of the &s;ame Cloth, call'd
the <HI>Stole,</HI> 18 or 20 Inches broad, and twice as
long, which is extremely trouble&s;ome. Under
their Gowns they have only a little Doublet, almo&s;t
quite cover'd with black Lace, and adorn'd with
Ribbans at the turning up of the Sleeves. Their
Shirts are always very white and fine. Their
Breeches are open and very wide, like tho&s;e that
were us'd by Citizens in <HI>France</HI> Fifty Years ago;
<PB N="393" REF="220">
and they are al&s;o full of Lace and Ribbans. This
Garb is both &s;tately and cheap; for a Gown la&s;ts
at lea&s;t three or four Years. The only Fault I
find in their Habit is that they u&s;e neither Bands
nor Cravates. Formerly they were oblig'd to wear
their own Hair, but now they u&s;e the fine&s;t and
longe&s;t Periwigs, which is certainly one of the
mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary parts of their Dre&s;s: for their Caps
are &s;o ill-contriv'd, that there can be nothing
more proper to disfigure a Man's Face, which
perhaps is the rea&s;on why at pre&s;ent they only
wear 'em in their Hands like a Fan.</P>
<P>The&s;e Nobles, notwith&s;tanding the Dignity of
their Character, &s;cruple not to go to the Market, and
buy all the little Provi&s;ions that are requir'd for
the maintaining of a Family. But I believe they
are injur'd by tho&s;e who pretend that they carry
home their Provi&s;ions in the Sleeves of their Gowns;
for there are Porters or <HI>Ce&s;tarioli,</HI> who have no
other Occupation, and who&s;e Hire is &s;o &s;mall, that
even the meane&s;t Trade&s;men make u&s;e of 'em.
Nor mu&s;t you imagine that the Principal and
Rich Nobles buy their own Provi&s;ions; for the
Markets are only frequented by the poorer &s;ort of
Gentlemen, of whom there is a con&s;iderable Num|ber,
and who&s;e Condition is the more deplorable,
becau&s;e they mu&s;t not endeavour to improve it by
Trading.</P>
<P>I know not what Apology to make for the ex|ce&s;&s;ive
Length of my Letter, unle&s;s you will be
&s;atisfy'd with that common Excu&s;e for all &s;orts
of Faults, that I did not intend it. I confe&s;s that
will not make amends for the trouble I have gi|ven
you, but I hope you'll for once admit a Plea
that can never be more ju&s;tly urg'd than in Ca|&s;es
of this Nature; for it oftentimes happens, that
when a Man comes to the End of the Leaf
where he de&s;ign'd to have ended his Letter, he
<PB N="394" REF="221">
finds him&s;elf oblig'd to begin another, and per|haps
two or three before he can fini&s;h his Mat|ter.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIX.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have &s;een the famous Ceremony of <HI>A&s;cen&s;ion-Day,</HI>
and was &s;o tran&s;ported with Plea&s;ure at
the Sight of that celebrated Solemnity, that I was
&s;trongly tempted, and almo&s;t fully re&s;olv'd to &s;end
you a De&s;cription of it. But upon &s;econd and
cooler Thoughts, I con&s;ider'd that I cou'd add
nothing to what &s;o many Authors have already
&s;aid on that Subject, and therefore I &s;hall only tell
you, that the prodigious Quantity of <HI>Gondola's</HI> that
cover'd the whole Surface of the Sea from <HI>Venice</HI> to
the Mouth of the <HI>Lido,</HI> made me almo&s;t give
Credit to the u&s;ual Computation of the <HI>Venetians,</HI>
who affirm, that there are <HI>Five and twenty Thou|&s;and
Gondola's</HI> in the City. The Number of tho&s;e
little Ve&s;&s;els might be more ea&s;ily calculated than
that of the Inhabitants; becau&s;e every <HI>Gondolier</HI> is ob|lig'd
to pay a certain Tax to the State. The
Dexterity of the&s;e Boatmen is &s;urprizing, and
even almo&s;t incredible; for tho' they &s;eem to fly
as &s;wift as a Bird, and tho' the Canals are both
narrow, and in &s;everal Places cro&s;s one another,
they never run foul of tho&s;e whom they meet.
<PB N="395" REF="221">
To avoid the Di&s;orders that happen on &s;uch Oc|ca&s;ions,
they make a Noi&s;e at each Corner of the
Canal to give Warning to tho&s;e that are within
the reach of their Voice, who an&s;wer in a Dia|lect
con&s;i&s;ting of Words that are only known to
them&s;elves, &s;uch as <HI>Preci, Prami,</HI> and <HI>Sia,</HI> which
they under&s;tand &s;o well, that immediately they
turn their <HI>Gondola's,</HI> and pa&s;s by without touch|ing
one another. The&s;e <HI>Gondola's,</HI> which are all
made after the &s;ame Fa&s;hion, from that which
belongs to the fir&s;t Procurator to tho&s;e that are
commonly hir'd, are a &s;ort of flat-bottom'd, nar|row,
and very long Boats. In the middle there is
a little Chamber cover'd with cour&s;e black Serge,
with an Opening before in&s;tead of a Door; and
on each Side there is a Window that may be
&s;hut with Curtains, or &s;ometimes with a Piece of
the &s;ame Serge which hangs at the Top of the
<HI>Gondola,</HI> and is u&s;ually turn'd up in fair Weather.
The Price of a <HI>Gondola</HI> ready made amounts to
five and twenty <HI>Ducats;</HI> but in tho&s;e that belong
to &s;ome of the principal Noblemen, there are
Grates that &s;ometimes co&s;t above a Hundred
Crowns; and be&s;ides, the Windows may be a|dorn'd
with Gla&s;&s;es like tho&s;e that are us'd on
Coaches; which is all the Embelli&s;hment that is
allow'd by the Republick. The meane&s;t <HI>Gondolier</HI>
earns half a <HI>Ducat</HI> a Day; and there are &s;ome
who will not &s;erve under a Crown: So that con|&s;idering
that every <HI>Gondola</HI> requires four Men, it
will be found at the End of the Reckoning that
one of the&s;e Boats con&s;umes as much Money as
the keeping of a Coach and Six Hor&s;es.</P>
<P>The Ceremony of the <HI>Bucentaur,</HI> according to
the u&s;ual Cu&s;tom, was &s;ucceeded by a very mag|nificent
Fea&s;t, that la&s;ted Fifteen Days. This may
be reckon'd a &s;econd <HI>Carnaval,</HI> and does really ex|ceed
the fir&s;t. 'Tis true, there are no <HI>Opera</HI>'s nor
<PB N="396" REF="222">
<HI>Comedies,</HI> but that Defect is more than &s;upply'd
by the enlivening Beauty of the Sea&s;on, and by
one of the fine&s;t and riche&s;t <HI>Fairs</HI> in <HI>Europe,</HI> which
is kept in the Place of S. <HI>Mark,</HI> and in the <HI>Brog|lio,</HI>
where the Shops are rank'd with &s;uch a har|monious
Proportion and Uniformity, that one
wou'd think it were a City purpo&s;ely built for
Plea&s;ure. The Street of the <HI>Gold&s;miths,</HI> and that
of the <HI>Mercers</HI> are extremely magnificent; for the
Shops are full of the riche&s;t Commodities, and
every Morning and Evening one may have the
Plea&s;ure to &s;ee the be&s;t Company in Town, and
e&s;pecially the Ladies, who come to oblige the
longing Spectators with a View of their Charms,
and to make Strangers confe&s;s that they are bet|ter
furni&s;h'd with the noble&s;t Ornament of their
Sex than all the mo&s;t celebrated Beauties in o|ther
Countries. And I cannot forbear adding up|on
this Occa&s;ion, that the Liberty I ob&s;erv'd in
this Place &s;eems to be altogether incon&s;i&s;tent with
the Slavery which the&s;e fair ones are &s;aid to &s;uf|fer.
'Tis certain that the Ladies in this Place are
more clo&s;ely confin'd than in <HI>France;</HI> but their
Re&s;traint is not &s;o &s;evere as we commonly ima|gine.
'Tis true, 'twou'd be thought indecent for
a Woman to walk, or to entertain a private Di&s;|cour&s;e
with tho&s;e of our Sex; nor is it u&s;ual for
Ladies to make Matches for Gaming. But to
make amends for the&s;e Niceties, they are permit|ted
to &s;ee <HI>Opera's</HI> and <HI>Plays,</HI> to go to the <HI>Ridotti,</HI>
the <HI>Fre&s;co,</HI> and <HI>Fairs,</HI> and to walk about the
Streets in <HI>Ma&s;querade,</HI> either alone or in Com|pany.
I leave you to judge whether their Con|finement
be &s;o rigorous as 'tis u&s;ually repre&s;ented,
and whether they have rea&s;on to complain of the
Severity of their Husbands. For my part, I'm apt
to think that there are few Men in <HI>France</HI> or
<HI>Holland</HI> that wou'd willingly allow their Wives the
<PB N="397" REF="222">
Liberty to go abroad without any other Compa|ny
than one or two Maids, and after they have
run Ma&s;qu'd about the Streets all Day long, to pop
into a publick Gaming-Hou&s;e, where there are
more Courte&s;ans than any other Company. This
is the u&s;ual Recreation of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Ladies,
which they daily u&s;e without expo&s;ing them&s;elves
to their Husband's Anger, or the Cen&s;ure of their
Neighbours; tho' in &s;uch Frolicks they meet with
many a fair Opportunity of indulging them&s;elves
in more criminal Diver&s;ions; for they are perpe|tually
&s;urrounded with Temptations, and 'tis impo&s;&s;i|ble
for a Lady to ramble about a whole Day with|out
hearing Twenty Compliments of that Nature.
'Tis the Cu&s;tom of the Place, and the particular
Privilege both of the <HI>Carnaval</HI> and <HI>Fair,</HI> that any
Man may demand the <HI>la&s;t Favour</HI> of a Woman
whom he finds alone in a Vizor-Mask; for that
Circum&s;tance alone gives her the Denomination
of <HI>Signora Ma&s;cara,</HI> and &s;he's reckon'd as lawful
Prize as if &s;he were cloath'd in the ob&s;cene&s;t and
mo&s;t extravagant Garb. You may freely acco&s;t
any Woman that wears this Badge, without put|ting
off your Hat, or u&s;ing any other Ceremony
what&s;oever; but if they return no An&s;wer to
your &s;econd or third Que&s;tion, you may leave off
your Court&s;hip, and conclude that they will not
be debauch'd. Neverthele&s;s 'tis highly dangerous
to u&s;e the &s;ame Freedom with a Lady that walks
without a Mask; for in &s;uch Ca&s;es we are only
allow'd the Privilege of Gazing and Wi&s;hing,
and all other Liberties are &s;o rigorou&s;ly prohibi|ted,
that the highe&s;t Affront that can be offer'd
to a Woman, is to &s;alute her; for none but Curte|zans
will permit that Freedom.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Ma&s;querades</HI> are not only very diverting, but
extremely commodious for &s;everal &s;orts of People.
How many Per&s;ons are there who wou'd be con|fin'd
<PB N="398" REF="223">
to their Hou&s;es by the Gravity of their Cha|racter,
if &s;uch a Di&s;gui&s;e did not give 'em an
Opportunity of &s;haring in the publi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> Diver&s;ions.
How many Princes, Dukes, Procurators, and other
Per&s;ons of high Quality, take the Advantage of &s;o
&s;avourable an Occa&s;ion to &s;hake off that Load of
Grandeur with which they are continually op|pre&s;s'd;
and breaking loo&s;e from their gawdy
Pri&s;ons, ramble about <HI>Incognito</HI> among the Crowd,
and find more Plea&s;ure in per&s;onating a Citizen
or Trade&s;man, than ever they cou'd enjoy in
their Palaces. For a <HI>Mask</HI> has this admirable
Quality, that it can in a Moment transform a
Prince into a Porter; and one of the greate&s;t
Advantages of &s;uch a &s;urprizing <HI>Metamorpho&s;is</HI> is,
that every Man may re&s;ume his own Figure when
he plea&s;es. If we may believe the <HI>Venetians,</HI> a
certain Great Prince, who is known over all the
World, &s;crupl'd not to act a part in the&s;e agree|able
Frolicks.</P>
<P>The whole <HI>Carnaval,</HI> and the Fe&s;tival after <HI>A&s;cen&s;i|on-Day</HI>
is &s;pent in <HI>Ma&s;querading,</HI> and all that while there
&s;eems to be a New Republic form'd in the mid&s;t of
the other. There is an univer&s;al Change in the Ha|bits,
Cu&s;toms, and Laws. All <HI>Marks</HI> of <HI>Di&s;tinction</HI> and
<HI>Superiority</HI> are forgotten, or at lea&s;t neglected; All
Per&s;ons are, or &s;eem to be equal: Re&s;pect, Con|&s;traint,
Ceremony, Care, and Bu&s;ine&s;s, are ba|ni&s;h'd
from Society, and are &s;ucceeded by Joy,
Liberty, and an agreeable Sort of Folly. Under
this Di&s;gui&s;e many plea&s;ant Intrigues are carry'd
on; and Strangers are oblig'd to that Concealer
of Blu&s;hes for many a happy Moment. I know
one that was acco&s;ted by a Lady, who carry'd
him to a little Hou&s;e; where, having open'd the
Door with a Key that &s;he had in her Pocket,
&s;he put him in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a thou&s;and
charming Beauties; yet all his Arguments and In|treaties
<PB N="399" REF="223">
cou'd not procure him a &s;ight of her Face;
for her Mask was ty'd on with a Silver Chain
fa&s;ten'd with a little Padlock. But the &s;trange&s;t
<HI>Ma&s;cara</HI> that ever I had occa&s;ion to &s;ee, or per|haps
that ever appear'd in <HI>Venice,</HI> was a Woman
who came to the Fair, cover'd from Head to
Foot with a &s;ort of long Gown or Shroud. She
had no Clothes under it, not &s;o much as a
Smock, and from time to time &s;he open'd her Gown,
and oblig'd the Company with a full View of her
Wares. Thus &s;he walk'd three or four times about
the Fair, and was doubtle&s;s very narrowly and
attententively view'd by the Spectators. This Frol|lick
was thought to be occa&s;ion'd by a Wager.</P>
<P>During the Fair, the whole Place of S. <HI>Mark,</HI> and
part of the <HI>Broglio,</HI> is cover'd with Shops: The
other part is full of <HI>Juglers, Tumblers, Puppet-Players,
Bears,</HI> and <HI>Mountebanks,</HI> who are <HI>dancing</HI>
frequented by all &s;orts of People, from the <HI>Noble|man</HI>
to the <HI>Gondelier.</HI> But the greate&s;t Croud is
about certain <HI>Female-A&s;trologers,</HI> who are mounted
on little Stages or Scaffolds, cover'd with Lace and
Ribbons like Puppets; their Faces painted white and
red, and &s;urrounded with a great Number of Books,
full of Figures and Characters, tho' they under|&s;tand
no more of 'em than to di&s;tingui&s;h the
White from the Black. There are al&s;o &s;ome Men
who follow the &s;ame Trade; but they are not
&s;o much follow'd as the Women, who&s;e triple
Top-knots draw the Multitude after 'em. They
&s;it upon a Chair, from whence, as<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">from a <HI>Tripos,</HI>
they blow good Fortune to their Cu&s;tomers thro'
a Tin Trunk eight or ten Foot long, the Que|ri&s;t
putting the other End to his Ear. The Price
of a Con&s;ultation is no more than <HI>Five-pence;</HI>
and for &s;o &s;mall a Summ you may have the
Promi&s;e of as much Honour and Riches as you
plea&s;e. The&s;e Wenches, who &s;ometimes are not
<PB N="400" REF="224">
ugly, ob&s;erve an admirable Gravity in pronoun|cing
their <HI>Re&s;pon&s;es;</HI> but they are not &s;o &s;tarch'd
in private, and may be ea&s;ily prevail'd with to
lay a&s;ide their affected Severity. One of my
Friends, who is a <HI>Germain</HI> Officer, happen'd t'o|ther
Day to try the Experiment; and &s;ince the
Story is not unplea&s;ant, I &s;hall make bold to en|tertain
you with it. As we were taking our
Diver&s;ion in the Fair, we took particular Notice
of one of tho&s;e <HI>She-A&s;trologers,</HI> who was one of the
prettye&s;t and grave&s;t of the whole Tribe. She
was &s;urrounded with a Croud of People of all
Ages and Ranks, who approach'd one after ano|ther
to the End of her Trunk to learn their Fate,
and to hear the Oraculous Sentences which &s;he
pronounc'd with an incredible Maje&s;ty and Authori|ty.
My Friend took his Turn among the re&s;t,
and after &s;he had acquainted him with his For|tune,
told her that he was de&s;irous to con&s;ult
her about &s;ome private Affair, and therefore in|treated
her to turn the other End of the Trunk,
that he might communicate his Secret to her
without di&s;clo&s;ing it to the Company. But in&s;tead
of propo&s;ing &s;ome Que&s;tions to her about his For|tune,
he told her thro' her Trunk, that he came
not to de&s;ire the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of her pretended Art,
which &s;erv'd only to amu&s;e the Vulgar; that 'twas
in her Power to grant him a more &s;olid Favour;
and that his Bu&s;ine&s;s was to enquire where and
when he might &s;pend a Night with her. A&s;&s;oon
as &s;he had heard his Propo&s;al, &s;he turn'd the
Trunk and reply'd, that he ought not to be &s;ur|priz'd
at her way of Living, by impo&s;ing upon
the Credulity of the People, &s;ince the only Oc|cupation
of the greate&s;t part of Mankind con&s;i|&s;ted
in cheating one another, every one in his
own Way, and according to the Nature of his
Employment; and that for her part &s;he thought
<PB N="401" REF="224">
five or &s;ix Crowns a day but a moderate Recom|pence
for the Pains &s;he took in deceiving tho&s;e that
were willing to be deceiv'd; adding however that
&s;he was glad &s;he had found a Man of Sen&s;e, that
knew the Infirmities of Humane Nature, and wou'd
laugh with her at the Follies of Mankind, and
concluded with giving him an A&s;&s;ignation at an
Inn, where &s;he promis'd to meet him that Evening.
Her agreeable Humour furni&s;h'd us with Matter of
Di&s;cour&s;e for above an Hour; but this was
the End of the Adventure, for the Officer did not
think fit to drive the Je&s;t further.</P>
<P>Tho' the Summer is &s;carce begun, the Heat is
already &s;o violent, that every one endeavours to
make it le&s;s in&s;upportable by the Thinne&s;s and Light|ne&s;s
of his Clothes. Now I &s;peak of Habits, I
wi&s;h you cou'd &s;ee that which is us'd by the
Girls that vi&s;it the Fair every Day to look out
for a Cu&s;tomer. For every Mother that is willing
to be rid of her Daughter, carries her thither
every Day as to a Market, with all the alluring
Ornaments of an advantageous Dre&s;s. They have
large and very fine Top-knots; their Neck and
Brea&s;ts are bare; and their Habit con&s;i&s;ts chiefly
of a little Cloak or Mantle of white Mu&s;lin, a|dorn'd
with red Ribbons, a &s;ingle Petticoat of
the &s;ame Cloth, a neat Pair of Shooes and Silk-Stockins,
exactly fitted to their Legs. There is
nothing more proper to in&s;pire Love than the &s;ight
of tho&s;e young Creatures, who for the mo&s;t part
are charming Beauties; nor is a Man forc'd to
purcha&s;e his Happine&s;s at the Rate of a tedious
Court&s;hip; for a&s;&s;oon as he feels Nature begin to
work, he may immediately addre&s;s him&s;elf to the
Mother, who is always ready to make the Bar|gain.
But tho' it will not co&s;t you a Sigh to
gain your Mi&s;tre&s;s's Heart, you mu&s;t pay dear for
the Enjoymnent of her Per&s;on: for you cannot
<PB N="402" REF="225">
purcha&s;e a hand&s;ome Maiden-Girl under 150
Crowns in hand, and as much every Year for
Entertainment. For 200 you may have the Choice
of the Market, where you may find &s;ome that
look like little Angels. Nor are you oblig'd to
buy a Pig in a Poke; for you may view and
handle her as much as you will, and examine
your Commodity both with your Eyes and Hands
before you agree upon the Price. As for the
Maiden-head, if the Mother promi&s;e to warrant
it, you may depend upon her word: for the&s;e
Matrons are too con&s;cientious to impo&s;e &s;econd-hand
Goods upon a Cu&s;tomer; and be&s;ides they
dare not venture upon a Cheat which they be|lieve
may be &s;o ea&s;ily di&s;cover'd. For 'tis as im|po&s;&s;ible
to root this Opinion out of the Minds
of the <HI>Italians,</HI> as of the <HI>Oriental</HI> Nations; and
whether it be true or fal&s;e, 'tis attended with this
advantageous Con&s;equence, that it makes the young
Women very careful of pre&s;erving their Trea&s;ure,
&s;ince they believe it impo&s;&s;ible to conceal the Lo&s;s
of it; at lea&s;t it has this Effect on tho&s;e who in|tend
to marry. But they who pretend only to be kept
are not &s;o nice, for tho' they take care to pre|&s;erve
their Maiden-head, they never &s;cruple to al|low
a Man all the Liberties that can be us'd
without deflowring 'em. I know a Woman that
has three Daughters; the two Elde&s;t are public</P>
<P>Courtezans, but the Third, who is ve|ry
pretty, is &s;till<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">A Maid.</NOTE> <HI>una Putta, una Vergine,</HI>
tho' &s;he has lain perhaps with a Hundred Men.
Yet &s;he is really a Maid, and wou'd not &s;ell
her Maiden-head a Farthing under Two hundred
Crowns. I cannot leave this Subject without ta|king
Notice of the extravagant Opinion of the
<HI>Italians,</HI> concerning one of the Properties of a
Beautiful Woman. In&s;tead of little, hard, and
well-&s;eparated Brea&s;ts, they love to have 'em
<PB N="403" REF="225">
large and fle&s;hy; &s;o that when they put their
Hand into the Bo&s;om of a Maid whom they in|tend
to purcha&s;e, if &s;he be not &s;o well provided
as they commonly de&s;ire, &s;he is forc'd to make
&s;ome pretty Excu&s;e, or to tell 'em laughing, That
<HI>&s;he has lent her Bubbies to her little Si&s;ter, or has
plaid 'em away at Ba&s;&s;ette.</HI> And even when a <HI>French|man</HI>
meets with &s;uch Girls, and tells 'em that he
is no Admirer of fle&s;hy Brea&s;ts, they u&s;ually an|&s;wer,
<HI>Ay, Sir, you are pleas'd to &s;ay &s;o; but if they
were larger you wou'd like 'em better.</HI></P>
<P>You will be apt to look upon this Way of
buying Girls as very odd and extravagant; but
I'm confident you will be no le&s;s &s;urpriz'd at
the Relation of an Adventure that happen'd to
one of my Friends, who is a <HI>French</HI> Officer late|ly
return'd from the <HI>Venetian</HI> Army. I remember
I promis'd you the Story, and I'm re&s;olv'd to
keep my Word, tho' I mu&s;t run the Hazard of
giving you an ill Opinion of my Friend's Cha|&s;tity.</P>
<P>During our Confinement in the <HI>Lazaretto,</HI> we
had no other Recreation, but what we found in
conver&s;ing with the <HI>Prior,</HI> who is a very accom|pli&s;h'd
Per&s;on: You may ea&s;ily divine the u&s;ual
Subject of our Di&s;cour&s;e. We hardly talk'd of any
thing but the <HI>Venetian</HI> Ladies, of who&s;e Beauty and
Gracefulne&s;s he gave us &s;o lively a De&s;cription,
that his feeling Expre&s;&s;ions made a very &s;trong Im|pre&s;&s;ion
on the Officer's Mind. Then he proceeded
to tell us, that we might ea&s;ily &s;atisfie our Incli|nations
to Love in this great City, without expo&s;ing
our &s;elves to the Cen&s;ures of a Critical and Ill-natur'd
World. In &s;hort, my Friend was &s;o charm'd
with his agreeable Conver&s;ation, and &s;o well pleas'd
with the Hope he gave him, that he cou'd not for|bear
prote&s;ting and repeating his Prote&s;tations more
than once, that he wou'd not leave the City
<PB N="404" REF="226">
without ta&s;ting the <HI>Dear Delight.</HI> His Guardian,
who never left him, and had often heard us talk
on that Subject, concluded that he had met with
a Man fit for his Purpo&s;e, that is, one who wou'd
&s;pare no Co&s;t to indulge his Inclination to Plea|&s;ure.
Re&s;olving then to make the be&s;t Advan|tage
of &s;o promi&s;ing an Opportunity, he took oc|ca&s;ion
to talk with him in private two days be|fore
our Departure, and told him with a great
deal of Confidence, that perceiving him to be a
great Admirer of hand&s;ome Women; and know|ing
that he wou'd probably meet with &s;ome in
that great City whither he was going, he thought
him&s;elf oblig'd to admoni&s;h him of the dangerous con|&s;equences
that frequently attended the Ra&s;hne&s;s of
an unexperienc'd Adventurer upon an unknown
Coa&s;t; &s;ince tho&s;e who &s;eem to be very &s;ound
and beautiful, are oftentimes mere lewd and rot|ten
Strumpets. But, added he, if you will tru&s;t
my Hone&s;ty, and lodge at my Hou&s;e, which is
both very neat and civil, I have an only Daugh|ter,
who has as much Beauty as any Lady in <HI>Venice;</HI>
her I'll be&s;tow upon you, and warrant her as
&s;ound and clean as a Pearl, as I hope in the
mo&s;t holy <HI>Madona.</HI> Then the Officer ask'd
him whether &s;he was a <HI>Maid,</HI> and he ve|ry
ingenuou&s;ly acknowledg'd that &s;he was
not, and that &s;he was kept by a <HI>Venetian</HI> No|bleman,
who allow'd her a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">200 Crowns.</NOTE> hun|dred
<HI>Sequins</HI> a Year: but, continu'd
he, tho' &s;he has hitherto ob&s;erv'd an inviolable Fi|delity
to her Keeper, I have &s;o &s;trong an Inclina|tion
to make you my Friend, that I'm re&s;olv'd to
give her to you, and I'm confident you'll be &s;a|tisfy'd
with her Per&s;on when you &s;ee her. My
Friend con&s;idering that at <HI>Venice</HI> a Man that loves
to keep him&s;elf clean and neat, mu&s;t not take a
Lodging at a Public Hou&s;e of Entertainment, and
<PB N="405" REF="226">
not knowing where to find a convenient Lodging,
accepted his Guardian's Offer, and went to his
Hou&s;e, where he took a very neat Room, and
agreed both for Diet and Lodging at a very rea|&s;onable
Rate. The next Morning his Landlord
carry'd him to his Daughter, who had a very mag|nificent
Apartment, con&s;i&s;ting of three fine Cham|bers
on a Floor, adorn'd with large Looking-Gla&s;|&s;es,
Cupboard and Scrutores of <HI>China,</HI> with two
Maids in a very hand&s;ome Garb to attend her. My
Friend was doubtle&s;s extremely well &s;atisfy'd with
every thing he &s;aw, and e&s;pecially with the lovely
<HI>Donna,</HI> who was one of the mo&s;t charming Beau|ties
in the World: But his Satisfaction la&s;ted not
long, for when he came to talk of the Price, &s;he
ask'd four times as much as he was able or wil|ling
to give her; &s;o that after two hours Wrang|ling,
he was forc'd to leave her without conclu|ding
the Bargain. Yet he continues &s;till to lodge
at her Father's Hou&s;e, who profe&s;&s;es as much
Friend&s;hip to him as ever. He told me that he
ob&s;erv'd one Piece of Furniture in the Young
Lady's Chamber that was very &s;uitable to one of
her Profe&s;&s;ion. 'Twas a very large Couch cover'd
with a Quilt of black Sattin, and directly over it
there hung at the Cieling one of tho&s;e <HI>Fans</HI>
which I had occa&s;ion to mention in one of my
former Letters. She confe&s;s'd that this was her
Lover's Contrivance, to qualifie the extreme Heat
of the Weather, which is never more in&s;upport|able
than when one is already &s;ufficiently heat|ed
with the eager Recreations of Love. And &s;he
a&s;&s;ur'd him that the all Nobles have &s;uch Fans
in their Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>Of all the Cu&s;toms that are peculiar to the
<HI>Italians,</HI> I know none that &s;eems odder and more
incommodious than that of lying &s;tark-naked in
their Beds, which is generally ob&s;erv'd by Men,
<PB N="406" REF="227">
Women, Boys, and Girls; and notwith&s;tanding
the Indecency of &s;uch a Cu&s;tom, the mo&s;t ba&s;hful
Virgin never &s;cruples to &s;trip her &s;elf to a &s;tate of
pure Nature on her Wedding Night, and to be|come
an <HI>Eve</HI> to her new <HI>Adam.</HI> 'Tis true, mo&s;t
Per&s;ons of Quality lie as we do, tho' there are
&s;everal even of that Rank, who follow the com|mon
Fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>The Curtezans enjoy here no le&s;s Liberty than
at <HI>Rome,</HI> and are divided into two di&s;tinct Or|ders.
The fir&s;t con&s;i&s;ts of &s;uch as are kept by par|ticular
Per&s;ons, &s;uch as the Guardian's Daughter;
and the&s;e are &s;o far from being imputed infamous
or contemptible, that they are envy'd by their
Companions, and are e&s;teem'd (as they &s;ay them|&s;elves)
if not <HI>Donne Honorate,</HI> at lea&s;t <HI>Donne de
propo&s;ito.</HI> And be&s;ides, they have this Advantage,
that they can ea&s;ily find a Husband after they
have gain'd Seven or Eight hundred <HI>Ducats;</HI> for
mo&s;t Trade&s;men are extremely fond of &s;uch con|&s;iderable
Fortunes. The other &s;ort of Curtezans
are &s;uch as pro&s;titute them&s;elves to all Comers, and
expo&s;e their Bodies indifferently to all &s;orts of
Per&s;ons. And even the&s;e, tho' they mu&s;t for ever
de&s;pair of retrieving their Honour by Matrimo|ny,
di&s;own the Name of <HI>Putane,</HI> and call them|&s;elves
<HI>Donne d'amore.</HI></P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding the extraordinary Kindne&s;s
and Beauty of the Women, the <HI>Venetians</HI> are ge|nerally
&s;o bruti&s;h, that they wou'd rather chu&s;e a
Boy, tho' as ugly as an Ape, than the mo&s;t A|miable
Girl in the World. This is the predomi|nant
Vice of the Nation, with which they are
&s;o mi&s;erably intoxicated, that they &s;pare no Pains
or Co&s;t to &s;atisfie their bea&s;tly Pa&s;&s;ions: And even
&s;ome of 'em are &s;uch Prodigies of Infamy, and
have &s;o entirely lo&s;t all &s;en&s;e of Humanity, that
they turn <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ccubus's</HI> to <HI>Porters</HI> and <HI>Gondoliers,</HI> whom
<PB N="407" REF="227">
they hire to act that Filthine&s;s upon their polluted
Bodies. All their Conver&s;ations are larded with
tho&s;e dete&s;table Impurities; and as in <HI>France</HI> 'tis
the u&s;ual Cu&s;tom of young Per&s;ons to divert them|&s;elves
with talking of their Intrigues with a love|ly
Mi&s;tre&s;s, their Di&s;cour&s;es in this Place run per|petually
on their Ma&s;culine Amours. Nor are the
<HI>Turks,</HI> them&s;elves more addicted to this unnatural
Abomination than the <HI>Italians</HI> &s;eem to be. The
<HI>Monks,</HI> e&s;pecially, are infamous for <HI>Sodomy</HI> as well
as <HI>Whoredom;</HI> and perhaps not without rea&s;on, for
tho' I am not &s;o particularly acquainted with
their manner of Living, as to give you an exact
Account of their Cu&s;toms and Practice, I can
a&s;&s;ure you (and one &s;ight of their Convents wou'd
convince you) that they a&s;&s;ume a great deal more
Liberty than their Brethren in <HI>France.</HI> About
&s;ome Weeks ago I vi&s;ited the Convent of S. <HI>Joan|ni
Paolo,</HI> to &s;ee the fine Pictures with which 'tis
adorn'd, e&s;pecially that of S. <HI>Peter Martyr,</HI> by <HI>Ti|tian,</HI>
which is e&s;teem'd one of the mo&s;t fini&s;h'd
Pieces in the World; and that of the <HI>La&s;t Supper,</HI>
at the bottom of the <HI>Refectory.</HI> After I had &s;a|tisfy'd
my Curio&s;ity with a View of the&s;e ad|mirable
Pictures, they &s;how'd me the Apartment
of one of the Fathers, which certainly merits the
particular Ob&s;ervation of every curious Traveller;
for I mu&s;t confe&s;s I &s;hou'd have rather fan&s;y'd it
to be the Re&s;idence of a Cardinal than the Ha|bitation
of a &s;olitary Friar. It con&s;i&s;ts of three
&s;mall Pavilions, rank'd in a &s;treight Line, each of
which contains two Chambers and a Hall. They
are &s;eparated by two Gardens, planted with O|range-Trees,
and divided into &s;everal Borders or
Beds of Flowers, adorn'd with Bu&s;ts and Statues.
'Tis true, there is no Water; but that defect is
&s;upply'd by a very fine Per&s;pective, repre&s;enting
a Fountain at the end of a long Walk, border'd
<PB N="408" REF="228">
with Trees. And this artificial Fountain is di&s;|cover'd
from the fir&s;t Pavilion thro' the &s;econd,
which is pierc'd and left open for that Purpo&s;e.
The Beauty of the Chambers is &s;utable to that
of the Garden; and to conclude, there are few
Places in the World le&s;s fit to in&s;pire a Man
with Thoughts of Mortification and Repen|tance.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not fini&s;h my Letter without giving you
&s;ome Account of the <HI>Opera's</HI> and <HI>Comedies,</HI> which
may be reckon'd one of the principal Diver&s;ions
of the <HI>Carnaval.</HI> All the Beauty of the <HI>Opera's</HI>
con&s;i&s;ts in <HI>Vocal Mu&s;ic</HI> and <HI>Machines;</HI> for there is
nothing in the <HI>Habits, Dancing,</HI> and even in the
<HI>Plays</HI> them&s;elves, that merits a particular De&s;cripti|on.
And, generally &s;peaking, they are much In|ferior
to tho&s;e that are repre&s;ented at <HI>Paris;</HI> for tho'
the <HI>French</HI> mu&s;t acknowledge them&s;elves indebted
to the <HI>Venetians</HI> for their <HI>Opera's,</HI> 'tis certain that in
this, as well as in &s;everal other Ca&s;es, they have
&s;urpa&s;s'd their Ma&s;ters. The <HI>Venetian</HI> Mu&s;ic does
not plea&s;e all &s;orts of Ears; &s;ome di&s;like the Af|fectation
of their exce&s;&s;ive Quavering, which made
one &s;ay, That they &s;eem'd to contend with Nigh|tingales,
who &s;hou'd be mo&s;t admir'd for the Volu|bility
of their Throats. But I mu&s;t confe&s;s I'm
of another Opinion, and I'm &s;o charm'd by the
melodious Accents of a fine <HI>Italian</HI> Voice, that I
can hardly forbear crying out with the <HI>Venetians,
I'm lo&s;t, I faint, I die.</HI> 'Tis true, tho&s;e agreeable
Tran&s;ports I u&s;ually feel on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, are
purely occa&s;ion'd by the <HI>Mu&s;ic,</HI> and by the Beau|ty
of the <HI>Voice,</HI> without any regard to the <HI>Words,</HI>
which are &s;o far from contributing to the Delight
of the Hearer, that he ought not to give the lea&s;t
attention to 'em; &s;ince the <HI>Italian</HI> way of &s;inging
is extremely un&s;uitable to tragical Subjects: For
what Impre&s;&s;ion wou'd it make upon your Mind
<PB N="409" REF="228">
to hear an <HI>Orlando Furio&s;o,</HI> or a de&s;pairing <HI>Atis,</HI>
warble out the terrible Pa&s;&s;ions with which they
are agitated, in a perpetual Quavering for a Quar|ter
of an Hour together? Wou'd you not imagine
that tho&s;e Actors de&s;ign'd to ridicule the pa&s;&s;ionate
Lovers whom they pretend to repre&s;ent? This puts
me in mind of the Air with which <HI>Harlequin</HI> us'd
to &s;ing on the Theatre of <HI>Burgundy, Ha! tu vas
trahir malheureu&s;e,</HI> &amp;c. This, Sir, is the main Ad|vantage
that recommends the <HI>French</HI> Way of Sing|ing
beyond the <HI>Italian;</HI> for the Mu&s;ic is made pur|po&s;ely
for the Words, and &s;o admirably well fitted
to 'em in every re&s;pect, that the Singing is more ex|pre&s;&s;ive,
and infinitely more touching than the
Words, e&s;pecially when there is Occa&s;ion to repre|&s;ent
a Per&s;on tran&s;ported with Sorrow, De&s;pair,
or Fury. But ab&s;tracting from this Con&s;ide|ration,
I'm &s;till of the Opinion, that the <HI>Itali|an</HI>
Mu&s;ic, &s;ingly con&s;ider'd, is finer than ours,
and that its Charms are extremely improv'd by
a &s;weet and tuneful Voice, which is no Rarity in
this Place.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o many different Opinions concern|ing
the <HI>Venetian Comedies;</HI> for I have heard &s;everal
Men of Sen&s;e not only de&s;pi&s;e 'em as Trifles, but
ab&s;olutely condemn 'em, as only fit to amu&s;e the
Eyes and Ears of Footmen and Porters. Others,
on the contrary, are &s;o much in love with this
Diver&s;ion, that they wou'd rather chu&s;e to deprive
them&s;elves of Meat and Drink, than to lo&s;e their
Share in &s;o agreeable a Plea&s;ure. For my part, I think
the&s;e Opinions are equally guilty of an Exce&s;s, and
I &s;ee no rea&s;on that &s;hou'd oblige us to run to ei|ther
of the&s;e oppo&s;ite Extremities. If every thing
that is not properly in&s;tructive, and does not di|rectly
tend to the Advancement of Vertue mu&s;t be
<PB N="410" REF="229">
ab&s;olutely rejected; I confe&s;s indeed, that the <HI>Ita|lian
Comedies</HI> ought to be bani&s;h'd out of the Re|publick;
but by the &s;ame Principle <HI>Masks, Balls,
Turnaments,</HI> and all &s;orts of <HI>Games</HI> mu&s;t be con|demn'd,
and the mo&s;t innocent Plea&s;ures mu&s;t be
reputed criminal. But &s;ince my Con&s;cience is not &s;o
nice, I mu&s;t own my &s;elf &s;o much a Friend to the <HI>Ve|netian
Comedies,</HI> that I can ea&s;ily bear with all
their Defects. 'Tis true, they can neither make
us wi&s;er nor better; but that Fault, if it be one,
is &s;ufficiently atton'd for by the Plea&s;ure they give
us. And I have often ob&s;erv'd, that tho&s;e moro&s;e
Criticks who talk of nothing but <HI>Edification,</HI> are
the fir&s;t who bur&s;t forth into Laughter, and expre&s;s
their Satisfaction by clapping their Hands. Yet
there are certain Indecencies which I cou'd wi&s;h
the <HI>Italian</HI> Poets wou'd avoid; and it were to be
de&s;ir'd, that they had more Regard to the Re&s;pect
that is due to the Mode&s;ty of Ladies, and to the
Rules of Civility that ought to be ob&s;erv'd between
Man and Man. But after all, I have a much bet|ter
Opinion of the <HI>French</HI> than of the <HI>Italian</HI> Thea|tre:
For I had rather learn to know my &s;elf in the
Characters of <HI>Moliere,</HI> than to be an u&s;ele&s;s Spe|ctator
of the Po&s;tures of <HI>Harlequin,</HI> or of the
Dreams of Dr. <HI>Balouarde;</HI> tho' if I had a conveni|ent
Opportunity, and knew not how to employ
my Time better, I &s;hou'd never &s;cruple to laugh
an Hour or two at their diverting Fooleries.</P>
<P>I had almo&s;t forgotten to acquaint you with a
plea&s;ant Cu&s;tom which is u&s;ually ob&s;erv'd in this
Place at the hearing of <HI>Opera's.</HI> The Female Mu|&s;icians
are always applauded at the End of their
Songs; but the Hearers make u&s;e of different ways
to expre&s;s their Satisfaction. If they only &s;ay
<HI>Cara, Cara,</HI> 'tis a &s;ign they are but indifferently
<PB N="411" REF="229">
pleas'd; but when they are touch'd to the quick,
they fill the whole Theatre with repeated Accla|mations,
crying as loud as they can, <HI>Mi Moro,
Mi Buto;</HI> and not unfrequently make u&s;e of &s;uch
immode&s;t and ob&s;cene Expre&s;&s;ions, that I dare not
&s;o much as repeat 'em.</P>
<P>In Obedience to your De&s;ire, I have made it
my Bus'ne&s;s to enquire into the Birth and Origi|nal
of the late Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> VIII. You are mi&s;|inform'd
by tho&s;e who a&s;&s;ure you that he was de|&s;cended
from a Noble Family: For <HI>John Ottoboni,</HI>
his Great-Grand-Father, was a Merchant, and was
not much taken Notice of at fir&s;t, tho' he afterwards
gain'd a con&s;iderable E&s;tate, which recommended
both him and his Children to the Con&s;ideration
of the Publick. His Elde&s;t Son, <HI>John Francis,</HI> was
advanc'd to the Dignity of <HI>Great Chancellor,</HI> the
highe&s;t Office to which a Citizen can pretend;
for tho&s;e who are rais'd to that Po&s;t are honour'd
with the Title of <HI>Excellency,</HI> and wear a <HI>Red Gown.</HI>
His Son <HI>Leonard,</HI> who had already &s;erv'd the Re|public
as Secretary to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Emba&s;&s;y, and af|terwards
as Agent in that Country, was advanc'd
to the &s;ame Office in the Year 1639. and conti|nu'd
in that Po&s;t till his Death. He left two Sons,
<HI>Francis,</HI> and <HI>Peter</HI> who was afterwards made Pope:
<HI>Francis</HI> marry'd, and left a Son call'd <HI>Anthony,</HI>
who is &s;till alive; but <HI>Peter,</HI> who had not yet ta|ken
a Wife, endeavour'd to procure a certain Of|fice,
which, notwith&s;tanding all his earne&s;t Solici|tations,
was be&s;tow'd on another Citizen, who&s;e
Family had never been intru&s;ted with the Manage|ment
of any Public Affairs: And he was &s;o nettl'd
at &s;uch an unexpected Di&s;appointment, that for
mere Vexation he re&s;olv'd to embrace an Eccle&s;i|a&s;tical
Life. Two or Three Years after, the Bi|&s;hop
<PB N="412" REF="230">
of <HI>Padua</HI> gave him a Place in his Chapter,
where he continu'd for &s;ome time; but being na|turally
of an impatient and ambitious Temper, he
&s;oon grew weary of that Po&s;t: And I'm inform'd
that he us'd frequently to tell his Friends that
&s;omething whi&s;per'd perpetually in his Ears, and
bid him go to <HI>Rome.</HI> The&s;e Sugge&s;tions flatter'd
his Ambition, and made him &s;o unea&s;ie at <HI>Padua,</HI>
that he left his Place, and went to that Great Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical
Court, where by his Intrigues, Com|plai&s;ance,
and Di&s;&s;imulation, of which he was an
Ab&s;olute Ma&s;ter, he acquir'd &s;everal powerful Pa|trons,
and in&s;inuated him&s;elf &s;o dexterou&s;ly into
the Favour of the re&s;t, that in 1652, he obtain'd
a Cardinal's Cap of Pope <HI>Innocent</HI> X. and was af|terwards
made Bi&s;hop of <HI>Bre&s;cia</HI> in the State of
<HI>Venice.</HI> But his Ambition was not &s;atisfy'd by &s;o
con&s;iderable a Preferment; for he &s;till continu'd
to manage his Game with &s;o much Dexterity and
Succe&s;s, that at la&s;t he was advanc'd to the Papal
Throne by the <HI>French</HI> Faction, and by the Intere&s;t
and Solicitation of Cardinal <HI>de Bouillon,</HI> who to re|gain
his Ma&s;ter's Favour, left no Means une&s;&s;ay'd
to rai&s;e this Prelate to the Apo&s;tolic See. 'Twas
on the 6<HI>th</HI> of <HI>October,</HI> 1689, that the Supreme Dig|nity
was conferr'd upon him; and his Advance|ment
occa&s;ion'd a general Satisfaction. <HI>Rome</HI>
thought &s;he had now a Bi&s;hop, who wou'd aim
at nothing &s;o much as the Exaltation of the
Church and the Holy See: <HI>France</HI> concluded that
&s;he had at la&s;t obtain'd a Pope who was ab&s;olute|ly
devoted to her Intere&s;t: The <HI>Empire</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI>
hop'd that he wou'd promote the Public Good of
<HI>Chri&s;tendom:</HI> And <HI>Venice</HI> was over-joy'd to &s;ee one
of her Citizens in a Condition to rai&s;e the Glo|ry
of his Country. In the la&s;t of the&s;e Places,
e&s;pecially, all po&s;&s;ible Care was taken to expre&s;s
<PB N="413" REF="230">
the publick Satisfaction with all the Marks of
Splendor and Magnificence: <HI>Anthony</HI> the Pope's
Nephew was honour'd with the Title of a No|bleman,
and at the &s;ame time was made <HI>Knight
of the Golden Star,</HI> and Procurator of S. <HI>Mark by
Merit.</HI> He &s;ent his two Sons <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Mark</HI> to
<HI>Rome,</HI> where the latter was immediately preferr'd
to an advantageous Match; and the former was
made <HI>Cardinal Patron.</HI> Dignities and Riches were
heap'd without mea&s;ure upon all the re&s;t of the
Pope's Relations, who &s;eem'd, like &s;o many Mu&s;h|rooms,
to &s;pring up in a Night. Their &s;udden
Advancement gave <HI>Pa&s;quin</HI> occa&s;ion to &s;ay, That
<HI>his Holine&s;s had &s;ignaliz'd his Acce&s;&s;ion to the Pontifi|cal
Throne by a Miracle:</HI> And <HI>Marforio</HI> demanding
what it was, he reply'd, That <HI>the Pope had re&s;tor'd
to Life one that was Dead;</HI> meaning the <HI>Nepoti&s;m,</HI>
which &s;eem'd to have been utterly extingui&s;h'd
by <HI>Innocent</HI> XI. And indeed never Pope made &s;o
good U&s;e of his Time as this <HI>Alexander:</HI> But
&s;ince I have already given you an Account of
his Character and Actions, I &s;hall only add, that
he went out of this World loaded with Cur&s;es,
that his Memory is odious to all Mankind, and
that never any Man's Death was le&s;s lamented
than his. <HI>Rome</HI> dete&s;ts him by rea&s;on of his Luxu|ry,
and becau&s;e he e&s;tabli&s;h'd the <HI>Nepoti&s;m:</HI> The
<HI>Empire</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> hate him as one that was their
declar'd Enemy: <HI>France</HI> is incens'd again&s;t him
becau&s;e of the terrible Blow he gave her towards
the end of his Pontificate: And <HI>Venice</HI> abhors the
Memory of a Citizen, who in&s;tead of proving a
Benefactor to his Country, &s;eem'd on all Occa|&s;ions
to be its mortal Enemy. At <HI>Rome</HI> they be|gan
to expre&s;s their Hatred before he expir'd;
for in the Night in which he dy'd there was a
Paper affix'd to the Gate of the <HI>Vatican,</HI> in
<PB N="414" REF="231">
which he was repre&s;ented in the Po&s;ture of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
that is going to take Hor&s;e, with the&s;e Words
written underneath, <HI>If any Man wou'd &s;end a Let|ter
to the Devil, here is a Po&s;t ju&s;t ready to depart.</HI></P>
<P>After his Death, Prince <HI>Anthony</HI> his Nephew,
endeavouring by his Intrigues to exclude Cardi|nal
<HI>Barberino,</HI> and to promote the Faction of the
<HI>Pignatelli,</HI> the <HI>Venetians</HI> depriv'd him of the Procu|rator&s;hip,
and at the &s;ame time remov'd him from
the Management of Publick Affairs, and even
prohibited him to appear in the Council; &s;o that
at pre&s;ent in&s;tead of a Procurator's Ve&s;t, he wears
only a Citizen's &s;hort Cloak. Yet he was not de|graded,
but only &s;u&s;pended from the Exerci&s;e of
his Offices.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not leave <HI>Venice</HI> without acquainting you
with the ridiculous Opinion the <HI>Italians</HI> have of
the <HI>French</HI> Cu&s;toms: They imagine that a Man
may Ki&s;s and Handle a Young Woman as roughly
and indecently as he plea&s;es before her Father and
Mother, and that one may take the &s;ame Liberty
with a Wife in the Pre&s;ence of her Husband; and
from thence they infer, that they are guilty of
more Criminal Familiarities in private. You &s;ee
what an injurious Opinion they have of our
Nation, and e&s;pecially of the Cha&s;tity of our
Ladies; and yet this extravagant Conceit is on|ly
grounded on the Civility of our Countrymen,
who permit a Friend or Relation to Salute a Wo|man
with a Ki&s;s after a long Ab&s;ence; and are
not &s;o horn-mad as to enter an Action again&s;t a
Man for every Ki&s;s he &s;teals from a Woman.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee how fatally Men are deluded by
that unconquerable Inclination they have to mag|nifie
<PB N="415" REF="231">
every thing. As &s;oon as they hear of any
thing that is unu&s;ual, they in&s;tantly fan&s;ie it to
be a Prodigy, and conclude that 'tis either again&s;t
the ordinary Cour&s;e of Nature, or contrary to
common Sen&s;e. I have had occa&s;ion to di&s;cour&s;e
with &s;everal Per&s;ons that are no <HI>Italians,</HI> who a&s;|&s;ure
me that in <HI>England</HI> a Man may freely Ki&s;s
the fir&s;t hand&s;ome Woman he meets in the Street,
and even that all Women, not excepting the
chief Ladies of the Court, are oblig'd to allow
&s;uch Liberties. But tho' I never was in that
Country, I'm &s;o far from believing the Story,
that I'm confident, and dare venture to affirm,
that 'tis ab&s;olutely fal&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude my Letter with telling you
that I have &s;een <HI>Padua,</HI> which is a very large
Town, but &s;o di&s;peopl'd, that one half of the
Hou&s;es are not inhabited; and that I have bought
a Hor&s;e to carry me to <HI>Holland;</HI> for I cou'd not
endure to be &s;o long &s;hut up in a Coach. I have
already &s;ent my Hor&s;e to <HI>Me&s;tre,</HI> a little Harbour
about five Miles from this City, in the Road to <HI>Au&s;|burg,</HI>
and am putting all things in a readine&s;s for
my Departure. And therefore to fini&s;h the De|&s;cription
of <HI>Venice,</HI> which &s;ome call the <HI>Rich,</HI> others
the <HI>Fair,</HI> and I the <HI>Licentious,</HI> I &s;hall only tell you,
that I'm extremely pleas'd with three things in it,
which I de&s;pair of finding in any other Place:
Fir&s;t, the <HI>Fe&s;tival Solemnities,</HI> which are always ac|company'd
with <HI>Shows:</HI> Secondly, the obliging
<HI>Sweetne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Beauty</HI> of the <HI>Women:</HI> And in the
la&s;t Place, the <HI>Neatne&s;s</HI> of the Hou&s;es within.
I have often heard <HI>Holland</HI> commended for the
extraordinary Neatne&s;s of its Hou&s;es, but I'm
per&s;uaded that even in this re&s;pect it does not exceed
<HI>Venice:</HI> For the very Floors are cover'd with a

&s;mooth and clear as a Looking-Gla&s;s: And all
the Furniture of the Hou&s;e is kept in the be&s;t
Order, and with the &s;ame Care and Exactne&s;s.
Every Cobler in the City takes care to furni&s;h
his Apartment with Hangings of gilt Leather, a
large Looking-Gla&s;s, and &s;ome pretty Pictures;
and the Magnificence of the Hou&s;es is always
&s;utable to the Riches of the Inhabitants.</P>
