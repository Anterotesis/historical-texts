</FIGURE> &leaf; By the King. &leaf; A Proclamation to preuent the furni&s;hing of the King of Spaine and his Subiects, with proui&s;ions for Shipping, or Munition for the Warres, and with Victuals.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_WHereas His Maie&s;tie by His Royall Proclamation, bearing date</HI> the one and thirtieth of December, in the fir&s;t yeere of His Highne&s;&s;e Reigne, for &s;peciall cau&s;es therein at large expre&s;&s;ed, did notifie to all manner of per&s;ons of all conditions, that &s;hould &s;end or carry into <HI>Spaine, Portugall, Burgundie,</HI> or any other of the King of <HI>Spaines</HI> Countries or Dominions, any manner of Graine or other Victuals, or any man|ner of Proui&s;ions, to Serue, Build, Furni&s;h, or Arme any Ships of Warre, or any kinde of Munition for the Warre, or materials for the &s;ame, being not of the nature of meere Merchandize; That Hee would not onely authorize His owne Admiralls and Captaines of His owne Shippes of Warre, but would al&s;o allow and ap|prooue all other His Subiects to Arme their Shippes, and with them to impeach and arre&s;t all Shippes that &s;hould Saile, either out of the Ea&s;t parts, or out of the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> or from any other Parts, with intention to pa&s;&s;e to <HI>Spaine, Portugall, Burgundie,</HI> or any other of the King of <HI>Spaines</HI> Countries or Dominions, or to any the &s;aid King of <HI>Spaines</HI> Ships being on the Seas, ha|uing on Board any &s;uch Graine, Victuall, Proui&s;ions of Warre, or Furniture for Shipping, or materialls for the &s;ame; and the &s;ame to bring into the next good Port, there to bee ordered as goods duely forfeited; the cau&s;es whereof being not onely notoriou&s;ly knowne to be mo&s;t true, but al&s;o much conducing to the common good of all His Maie&s;ties Confederates and Allies in Chri&s;tendome, as in the &s;aid Proclamation is &s;et foorth, His Maie&s;tie well hoped would haue produced that good effect which was de&s;ired.</P>
<PB REF="2">
<P>But becau&s;e it is found by experience, that in all States there will be &s;ome ill di&s;po&s;ed per&s;ons with whom priuate and particular gaine and aduantage will more preuaile then any publique re&s;pects, of what con&s;equence &s;oeuer; His Maie&s;tie intending to remooue all pretexts of ignorance or other exceptions, which may be taken again&s;t the proceedings of His Iudges and Officers, with any the Subiects of His Friends, Confederats, or Allies, who &s;hall hereafter offend in the Premi&s;&s;es, hath thought fit by the&s;e Pre&s;ents to make further declaration a&s;well of the Species or kinds of the things &s;o Prohibited, as of the penalties to be &s;uffered by the parties delinquent in &s;upplying the Enemies with the &s;ame prohibited things. Concerning therefore tho&s;e kinds wherewith His Maie&s;tie may not &s;uffer His &s;aid Enemies to be furni&s;hed, His Maie&s;tie doth by the&s;e pre&s;ents publi&s;h and notifie, that He holdeth the&s;e things following to be of that qualitie and condition; <HI>viz.</HI> Ordinance, Armes of all &s;orts, Powder, Shott, Match, Brim&s;tone, Cop|per, Iron, Cordage of all kinds; Hempe, Saile, Canuas, and Dant&s;e-Pouldauis, Cables, An|chors, Ma&s;ts, Rafters, Boate-Oares, Balcks, Capraues, Deale-board, Clap-board, Pipe-&s;taues, and Ve&s;&s;ells and Ve&s;&s;ell &s;tuffe, Pitch, Tarre, Rozen, Okam, Corne, Graine, and Victuals of all &s;orts, all Proui&s;ions for Shipping, and all Munition of Warre, or of Proui&s;ions for the &s;ame, ac|cording to former Declarations and Acts of State, made in this behalfe in the time of Queene <HI>Elizabeth</HI> of famous memory.</P>
<P>And therefore if any Per&s;on what&s;oeuer after Three Moneths, from the publication of the&s;e Pre&s;ents, &s;hall by any of His Maie&s;ties owne Ships, or the Ships of any His Subiects Autho|rized to that effect, be taken Sayling towards the places afore&s;aid, hauing on board any of the things afore&s;aid, or returning thence in the &s;ame Voyage, hauing vented or di&s;po&s;ed of the &s;aid Prohibited goods, His Maie&s;tie will hold both the Ships and Goods &s;o taken for lawfull prize, and cau&s;e them to be ordered as duely forfeited; whereby as His Maie&s;tie doth put in practi&s;e no Innouation, &s;ince the &s;ame cour&s;e hath beene held, and the &s;ame penalties haue beene heretofore inflicted by other States and Princes vpon the like occa&s;ions, and auowed and maintained by publique writings and Apologies; So now His Maie&s;tie is in a manner inforced thereunto by Proclamations &s;et forth by the King of <HI>Spaine</HI> and the Archduche&s;&s;e, in which the &s;ame and grea|ter &s;euerity is profe&s;&s;ed again&s;t tho&s;e that &s;hall carry or haue carried, without limitation, the like Commodities into the&s;e His Maie&s;ties Dominions.</P>
