<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>NOT to cheat thee with a Preface in&s;tead of a Book, nor make this Brat of my own Brain &s;uch a Rickety Crea|ture, as to have its Head bigger than all the re&s;t of the Body, both middle and t'other end; I'll only di&s;patch a little ne|ce&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s, and then Gentlemen &s;tep in and take your Places: Or to be a little more Heroical, the Mu&s;ick has played the la&s;t time, the Candles are all Snuffed, and the Curtain is ju&s;t about to be drawn up.&mdash;Know ye, fir&s;t and foremo&s;t, that the Name of this following Play relates to another part yet to come, which will more &s;ignally fill the Title; though this has enough of the <HI>Royal Voyage</HI> in it to make that good and proper in this, as well as the other. The <HI>Con|que&s;t of Granada</HI> is only begun in the fir&s;t part, nay, no more than the Siege on't, yet the propriety of the Title none ever que&s;tioned to that part as well as the other.</P>
<P>The next thing I'm to do you, to wit, is, that the <HI>End</HI> of this Play is chiefly to expo&s;e the Perfidious, Ba&s;e, Cowardly, Bloody Na|ture of the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> both in this and all pa&s;t Ages, e&s;pecially to give as lively a Scheme as will con&s;i&s;t with what's pa&s;t, &s;o far of the wor&s;e than Heatheni&s;h Barbarities committed by them on their Peaceable Briti&s;h Neighbours, in that Bloody and Dete&s;table Ma&s;&s;acre and Rebellion of <HI>Forty One,</HI> which will make the Nation &s;tink as long as there's one Bog or Bog-trotter left in it.</P>
<P>Wherein, though every one knows this way of Writing al|lows great Liberty; I prote&s;t 'twas impo&s;&s;ible to invent more dread|ful things than I found ready to my Hand; nay &s;carce could a &s;ingle circum&s;tance be any where added to &s;et their Murders in a better
<PB REF="3">Light,&mdash;the In&s;tances them&s;elves, as Hi&s;tory gives 'em, being &s;uch glaring ones, that Hell-Fire it&s;elf could &s;carce make 'em brighter. Nor even here have I taken any thing for granted, though there's &s;o much abundant Evidence of the truth of all here a&s;&s;erted, even from the acknowledgment of &s;ome more ingenuous among 'em, <HI>Beling, Wal&s;h,</HI> &amp;c. of their own Writers, and from the Pride and glory which others of them take in relating what then happened, in&s;tead of tho&s;e few Hundred Thou&s;ands Murder'd, only wi&s;hing that All had gon the &s;ame way; but dropping that advantage, have confined my &s;elf even to the Cha&s;tne&s;s of an Hi&s;torian, examining as the Reader will find, all the material Objections tho&s;e wicked People can make to our Accu&s;ations, and all tho&s;e thin Excu&s;es where|with they generally impo&s;e upon the Ignorant, and in vain en|deavour to palliate their unheard of Inhumanities. I am confident I have herein done 'em Ju&s;tice, and urged their Arguments as far and as home, perhaps clo&s;er, than any of them could have done for them&s;elves. And if I have made one Exception from the general Rule, and introduced one Iri&s;hman among&s;t 'em all, brave and ho|ne&s;t (as far as his Cau&s;e would let him be,) to foil the re&s;t; if I have gone a little beyond the Pale, and left Truth behind me, 'tis a pardonable fault, and the more ea&s;ily, becau&s;e perhaps it mayn't be &s;o common to err on the &s;ide of Good-nature. In his Character it's indeed de&s;igned to &s;hew that there may po&s;&s;ibly be &s;ome Individuals among 'em better than the re&s;t of the Nation.&mdash;In that of all the re&s;t, that if &s;uch a thing happens, 'tis but a chance, and won't often be brought into Example by the others. After all, let any Man take the pains but to read the Iri&s;h Hi&s;tories, Foreigners as well as others, nay their own too, if he has any patience, into the bargain, and if he does not confe&s;s that I have not, nay cannot mi&s;repre&s;ent the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> when I &s;peak any thing ill of 'em, I'll be content to be &s;ent over in|to that ble&s;&s;ed I&s;land, and live there 'till I've forgot my Mother Tongue, and grow as Iri&s;h as <HI>O Hanlan's,</HI> &amp;c) as their mannerly Proverb has it.)</P>
<P>Tho on t'other &s;ide, &s;o far is this piece from any Reflection on the Briti&s;h there, that one main end thereof is to give 'em their due En|comiums, and ju&s;t Honour.</P>
<PB REF="3">
<P>In order whereunto, the principal brave Actions performed by them at the wonder of the World, and confu&s;ion of their Enemies, under all apparent di&s;advantages imaginable, Treachery of &s;ome, Cowar|di&s;e of others, want of Nece&s;&s;aries, a numerous well-provided Ar|my pre&s;&s;ing again&s;t 'em, are not (as many as could be hand&s;omly brought in here) neglected, tho' the Hi&s;torical order, unnece&s;&s;ary here, perhaps not ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>For the manner in which tho&s;e actions are introduced, 'tis done the mo&s;t inoffen&s;ively that could be po&s;&s;ibly contrived; &mdash;'tis out of choice that I have named no Per&s;ons, unle&s;s of the Enemies &s;ide. &mdash;As all &s;hared in the Danger, &s;o let 'em all in the Glory,&mdash;what|ever parties there might then be, or are &s;ince, there &s;hall be none in this Play, but <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Iri&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>That the de&s;irable work of their entire Conque&s;t may &s;oon be ac|compli&s;hed, which all <HI>Europe</HI> as well as <HI>England</HI> groans for, the Second part of this Drama really acted, and our glorious King <HI>William</HI> there conquering all our Enemies, I am &s;ure every hone&s;t Man wi&s;hes as heartily as I do; &mdash; for tho&s;e who hope the contrary, tho' their own Countries, <HI>Europe</HI>'s, and Religion's implacable Enemies, I'd wi&s;h 'em no greater plague, than po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with all the Rage, Ma|lice, and defeated de&s;perate Wickedne&s;s of an Iri&s;h-man, to &s;tand by and &s;ee our great victorious Prince enter Triumphantly into his Royal City of <HI>Dublin,</HI> &mdash; which a few Weeks may in all fair pro|bability produce, and a few more the <HI>Second Part</HI> of the <HI>Royal Voyage,</HI> or <HI>Iri&s;h Expedition.</HI></P>
