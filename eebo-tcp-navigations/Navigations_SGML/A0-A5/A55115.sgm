<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE Hi&s;tory of the famous <HI>La|zarillo,</HI> needs no Pream|bulatory Di&s;cour&s;es to make it plea&s;ing. The <HI>French, Dutch, Italians,</HI> and, in a word, almo&s;t all Nations have wel|com'd him into their Language.</P>
<PB REF="4">
<P>The nice&s;t Criticks allow him to be a witty Fellow; and judge his Adventures may be read with as much Edificati|on as his Country-mens, <HI>Guzman,</HI> or the Brain|&s;ick Knight of the <HI>Man|cha.</HI></P>
<P>He was no &s;uch Fool to fight with a Wind|mill; or take a Flock of Sheep for a mighty Ar|my. All his conflicts were with his hard For|tune, again&s;t which it be|comes
<PB REF="4"> every wi&s;e Man to combate.</P>
<P>If a Man wants Diver|&s;ion, and be out of Hu|mour; he need only read what happened between him and the worthy Squire his Ma&s;ter, to put him into a fit of Laugh|ter.</P>
<P>The Editions, which have as yet appeared, of this Book in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> are &s;o full of flat and tedious Expre&s;&s;ions (be&s;ides the frequent and bold profa|nations
<PB REF="5"> and appeals to Heaven) as have nece&s;&s;a|rily required this new Tran&s;lation; wherein no|thing has been left out, but needle&s;s and ob&s;olete words, and &s;uch matters of Fact, as <HI>Lazarillo</HI> was never guilty of, as you'll &s;ee in the Adverti&s;ement which follows, to which I refer you if you need further &s;atisfaction.</P>

<HEAD>THE Plea&s;ant LIFE, AND Rare <HI>Adventures,</HI> of the Witty <HI>SPANIARD, Lazarillo de Tormes.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I. Lazarillo</HI> relates his Birth, together with the Amours of <HI>Antoinette Peres,</HI> his Mother, with the <HI>Moor Zaide.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MY Name is <HI>Lazaro de Tormes;</HI> and am the Son of <HI>Thomas Gon&s;ales</HI> and <HI>Antoinette Peres,</HI> both Natives of
<PB N="2" REF="9"> <HI>Tejares,</HI> a Village near <HI>Salamanca.</HI> I was born on the River of <HI>Tor|mes,</HI> whence I took my Sur-name.</P>
<P>My Father (Peace be with his Soul) had the charge of a Mill, which &s;tood on this River, where|in for the &s;pace of Fifteen Years, he laboured like a Man that under|&s;tood his Trade. My Mother be|ing one day in the Mill, big with me, fell in Travel, and was there delivered of me. Whence you may &s;ee, 'tis not without Rea&s;on, I call my &s;elf <HI>de Tormes.</HI></P>
<P>I was about Eight Years old, when my Father was accu&s;ed of bleeding the Sacks of Corn, which were brought thither to be ground. He, good Man, being loath to add Lying to his other Crime, confe&s;&s;|ed the Fact, and patiently under|went his de&s;erved Puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>An Army was rai&s;ed about this time again&s;t the <HI>Moors,</HI> and my Fa|ther who found him&s;elf a bani&s;h'd
<PB N="3" REF="9"> Man from his Country, for the Mi&s;hap afore&s;aid, enter'd him&s;elf into the Service of an Officer; who dying in this War, my Father, like a faithful Servant, followed his Ma&s;ter, &s;oon after, into the other World.</P>
<P>What could my Mother do, a poor comfortle&s;s Widow, after the Lo&s;s of &s;o dear a Husband? She re|&s;olves to live among&s;t vertuous people, determining now to be|come vertuous her &s;elf; wherefore &s;he leaves the Country, to inhabit in the City; takes a little Hou&s;e, and keeps a &s;mall Ord'nary, and turns Landre&s;s to certain Grooms; into who&s;e Stables having often oc|ca&s;ion to re&s;ort, &s;he grew into Fa|miliarity with a certain <HI>Moor,</HI> who look'd after the Hor&s;es under the Grooms: And they were &s;o good Friends in a little time, that the <HI>Moor</HI> came often in the Night to us, whence he did not depart till
<PB N="4" REF="10"> the Morning; he &s;ometimes al&s;o came in the Day-time under pre|tence of buying Eggs, though we never &s;old any; and, in &s;hort, fre|quented our Hou&s;e as it if had been his own.</P>
<P>This Familiarity, at fir&s;t, di&s;|gu&s;ted me; his black and ugly Countenance making me afraid: But when I perceived, his Vi&s;its made our Pot boil, I &s;oon pacified my &s;elf; for he &s;eldom came empty-handed.</P>
<P>But at length, Matters went &s;o forward, that my Mother brought forth a young <HI>Black,</HI> it being my charge to rock and play with him. I &s;hall never forget, how one Day my Father-in-law, the <HI>Moor,</HI> &s;port|ing with his little Son; the Child ob&s;erving my Mother and I were White, and his Father Black, he ran away affrighted to my Mother, and &s;tretching out his Finger, cry|ed, <HI>Mamma, the Devil.</HI> Where|at
<PB N="5" REF="10"> the <HI>Moor,</HI> laughing, &s;aid, <HI>Thou Ba&s;tard, art thou afraid of thy Father?</HI> As much a Child as I was, I could not choo&s;e but reflect on the&s;e Words of my little Bro|ther; &s;aying within my &s;elf, <HI>How many are there in the World, who laugh at others, for want of knowing them&s;elves?</HI> At length the Trade which <HI>Zaide</HI> drove (for this was the <HI>Moor</HI>'s Name) came to the Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e's Ear; and Matters being &s;earched into, it ap|peared that my Father &s;tole half of the Oats allowed the Hor&s;es, not &s;paring the Hor&s;e-Cloths, Shooes, Bridles, and every thing el&s;e which he could carry off fairly; which things he would daily bring to my Mother for the bringing up my young Brother, all which was proved again&s;t him; and I being examined, through Fear confe&s;s'd, I had, by my Mother's order, &s;old &s;everal of the&s;e things: Whereup|on
<PB N="6" REF="11"> my Father-in-law was con|demned to be &s;everely whipt, and my Mother &s;trictly charged, on pain of an Hundred Stripes, to enter no more into the Stables, nor admit the unfortunate <HI>Zaide</HI> into her Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>My poor Mother &s;ubmitted to this cruel Sentence without mur|muring; and to avoid the giving Occa&s;ion to ill Tongues, &s;he changed her Lodging, and placed her &s;elf as a Servant in an Inn.</P>
<P>In this laborious Condition, &s;he made an hard &s;hift to bring up my younger Brother till he could go alone; and, as for my part, I was at that Age, that I was very u&s;eful in tending the Gue&s;ts.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II. Lazarillo</HI>'s Mother places him in the Service of a blind Man. This Man's Conditions, and the plea|&s;ant Tricks which were play'd be|twixt them.</HEAD>
<P>A Blind Man came and lodged in this Inn; and hearing &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e of me, judged I might be a fit per&s;on to lead and tend him; and therefore he de|manded me of my Mother; who not &s;uffering her &s;elf to be much entreated, only told him, that I was the Son of a good Father, who dyed in the defence of the Faith again&s;t the Infidels, at the Battle of <HI>Gelves;</HI> and, that &s;he hoped, I &s;hould prove no le&s;s an hone&s;t Man; and, being a poor Orphelin, entreated him he would become a Father to me. The blind
<PB N="8" REF="12"> Man promi&s;ed more than &s;he could expect; or he, indeed, perform; whereupon, I immediately entred into my Office.</P>
<P>He remained &s;ome Days at <HI>Sala|manca;</HI> but finding his Gain &s;mall there, he re&s;olved to part thence. Having therefore taken my leave of my Mother, we left that Place.</P>
<P>Coming on the way as far as the entrance on the Bridge, there &s;tands a Statue of Stone, repre&s;en|ting a Bull: My blind Ma&s;ter bad me draw near it, &s;aying, <HI>Lazarillo, Put but thine Ear to this Bull, and thou &s;halt hear a &s;trange kind of Noi&s;e;</HI> which I had no &s;ooner done, but this old Rogue pu&s;h'd my Head with that devilli&s;h force again&s;t it, that I thought he had &s;plit my Skul in a Thou&s;and pieces: Scarce had I the u&s;e of my Sen&s;es for Three Days together; and he, for his part, was bur&s;ting out ever and anon into Laughter (which
<PB N="9" REF="12"> was no &s;mall aggravation of my Pain) telling me, <HI>That a blind Man's Boy, &s;hould have one Trick more than the Devil him&s;elf.</HI> Up|on this, I began to con&s;ider, That 'twas time for me to open mine Eyes, and look to my &s;elf, being a poor Boy that was left alone to &s;hift in the World.</P>
<P>We continued on our Journey, and he in&s;tructed me by the way in the <HI>Canting</HI> Language, which, to his great joy, I &s;oon learn'd: And he further &s;aid to me, <HI>See, Friend</HI> Lazarillo, <HI>I can neither give thee Gold nor Silver, but thou &s;halt not want &s;uch Coun&s;el as is of far greater Value:</HI> And truly, his Words were weighty; and though he was blind, yet he taught me to know the World.</P>
<P>He was a mighty ingenious Man in his way; he knew more Pray|ers by Heart, than all the blind Men be&s;ides in <HI>Spain;</HI> and could
<PB N="10" REF="13"> &s;o tone 'em, as made all the Peo|ple in the Church to ca&s;t an Eye towards him. His Mein was de|vout, grave, and humble; no Gri|maces, un&s;eemly rolling the Whites, or wry-Mouths, were ob|&s;ervable in him.</P>
<P>He had a Thou&s;and ways to draw Money from People, having Prayers by Rote, for all occa&s;i|ons; for Women that were bar|ren, for tho&s;e in Labour, for &s;uch as had &s;evere Husbands, and tho&s;e that were &s;tale Maids. He could tell the big-belly'd Women, whe|ther what they went with was a Boy or a Girl.</P>
<P>As for Phy&s;ical Remedies, <HI>Galen</HI> was a mere A&s;s to him. He had admirable Secrets for the Tooth|ach, all &s;orts of Cholicks, and Fits of the Mother. When any one complained to him of any Di&s;tem|per, he had immediately a choice Receipt ready: <HI>Do this,</HI> &s;aid he to
<PB N="11" REF="13"> one; <HI>You mu&s;t u&s;e &s;uch a thing,</HI> to another; <HI>Gather this Herb, take &s;uch a Root.</HI> All the World ran after him, and e&s;pecially the Wo|men-kind, who took him for a Man in&s;pired; though he was, in truth, the ba&s;e&s;t, and mo&s;t covetous Hound on the Face of the Earth.</P>
<P>He was not content to pinch his own Belly, but would needs &s;tarve me too; however, it &s;eldom hap|pened but I made my part good with him, and became the great|e&s;t &s;hearer in his Gain.</P>
<P>He was wont to keep his Provi|&s;ion in a little Cloth-bag, who&s;e Mouth was fa&s;tened with a Lock; and when he put in, or took out thence any thing, he would be &s;o on his Guard, that the craftie&s;t Fel|low in the World, mu&s;t be di&s;cou|raged from attempting to cheat him of the lea&s;t Crumb; and there|fore I mu&s;t be contented with that &s;mall Allowance he gave me:
<PB N="12" REF="14"> which would not amount to Two Mor&s;els. But when he clo&s;ed up his Bag, and imagined my Thoughts diverted on &s;omething el&s;e, I would &s;teal &s;oftly to it, and ripping one of the Sides of it, take thence pie|ces of Bread and Meat, and then dexterou&s;ly &s;ow up the Breach; and thus did I pre&s;erve my Life from Famine.</P>
<P>When any one gave him a piece of Money, whip it went into my Mouth, if it could be changed in|to a piece of le&s;&s;er Value, which I had ready in my Hand for him. He oft complained to me, &s;aying, <HI>Lazarillo, What the Devil means it, that &s;ince thou ha&s;t been with me I receive but half the Money for a Prayer which I was wont to have? &s;urely thou ha&s;t brought Misfortune with thee.</HI></P>
<P>But to be even with the People, he would cut a Prayer in half; and therefore ordered me as &s;oon as
<PB N="13" REF="14"> the per&s;on that imployed him was gone, to twitch him by the Cloak: Then pre&s;ently changing his Tone, he would cry aloud, <HI>Who will hear the Life of this Saint,</HI> or, <HI>hear this or the other Prayer?</HI></P>

<PB N="14" REF="15">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> The &s;ad Story of the Pot of Wine.</HEAD>
<P>AT Dinner or Supper time, he was wont to have an <HI>Earthen Pot of Wine</HI> &s;tanding by him, which was to him in&s;tead of a Bottle, which I would now and then whisk up to my Mouth, taking Two or Three go-downs, and then gently &s;et it in its place. This Trade la&s;ted not long with me; for, he not finding his mea&s;ure, held his Pot thence-forward by the Two Ears. However, this Caution avail'd him little; for getting a Reed, I drew the Wine out with great ea&s;e. The old Thief, I believe, heard me &s;uck at la&s;t; and therefore claps the Pot between his Knees, and laying one Hand upon it he feeds him&s;elf
<PB N="15" REF="15"> with the other. But I was &s;o u&s;ed to Wine, that, like Mon&s;ieur <HI>Ra|goo,</HI> I could live better without a Shirt, or Ho&s;e, than without Wine; however, my Reed &s;tood me in no &s;tead.</P>
<P>I bethought my &s;elf, after this, of making a little hole at the bottom of the Pot, and &s;topping it with &s;oft Wax; Then at Supper-time, pre|tending to be extream cold, I would get between my Ma&s;ter's Legs, and then take our little Lamp, as it were to warm my &s;elf, and applying it to the hole of the Pot, melt the Wax; and then would the Wine &s;purt out like a Spring into my Mouth, which would be &s;ure not to lo&s;e a drop. When my blind Ma&s;ter was for ha|ving th'other bout at it, the Pot was dry; and not being able to di|vine whence this could happen, he would cur&s;e and &s;torm like a mad Man. <HI>You cannot,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>&V;ncle,
<PB N="16" REF="16"> mi&s;tru&s;t me to have drunk your Wine, you take &s;ufficient care of that.</HI> He replyed not a Word, but turned and felt the Pot &s;o on all &s;ides, that he unhappily light on the hole. He &s;eemed at that time to take no notice of it; but the next day planting my &s;elf at the accu&s;tomed time and place in the &s;ame po&s;ture, whil&s;t I was bibbing with my Face upwards, in a plea&s;ing man|ner, with my Eyes half &s;hut, the enraged and cruel blind Man took his opportunity to be revenged of me; for, lifting up with both his Hands this <HI>&s;weet</HI> and <HI>&s;owr Pot,</HI> he di&s;charged it &s;o fiercely on my Face, that I thought the Roof of the Hou&s;e had fallen upon me. Im|po&s;&s;ible 'tis to imagine the Amaze|ment I was in; the Pot was beat into I know not how many pieces, &s;ome of which &s;tuck in my Face, and broke &s;everal Teeth out of my Head, which I want to this day.</P>
<PB N="17" REF="16">
<P>Since that time, I could never look on this malicious old Rogue without ill Will. He might make much of me, if he plea&s;ed; yet I knew well enough, the blow he had given rejoiced his Heart, and therefore I could never forgive him. He wa&s;h'd my Wounds with Wine, and grinningly &s;aid to me, <HI>Thou &s;ee&s;t,</HI> Lazarillo, <HI>how that which has made the Wound, now cures it.</HI> This Raillery was very well, but it did not plea&s;e me.</P>
<P>When I was half cured I began to think, that &s;hould this blind Wretch give me many &s;uch blows, he would &s;oon be rid of me; but I re&s;olved to prevent him by leaving him, tho' I did it not pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>Had I been the be&s;t humour'd Youth in the World, and forgot|ten the <HI>Blow with the Pot,</HI> yet the ill u&s;age he &s;hewed me afterwards, was &s;uch, as I could never forgive. He was always beating me, pinch|ing
<PB N="18" REF="17"> me or pulling me by the Hair. If any tender-hearted body blamed him, then would he recite the ad|venture of <HI>the Pot of Wine; and you believe,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>that this is &s;ome innocent Wretch? I tell you, the Devil him&s;elf cannot out-do him, in all manner of Roguery:</HI> which made tho&s;e that heard him, lift up their Hands, and cro&s;s them&s;elves, &s;aying ever at parting, <HI>Puni&s;h him, puni&s;h him, he will thank you for it another day:</HI> which Coun&s;el the Old Man would not fail to put in practice, nor I be behind hand in my Revenges on him; for I conti|nually led him through the wor&s;t ways. Were there any heap of Stones near us, any puddles and heaps of Dirt, he was &s;ure to pa&s;s through 'em. I mattered not the having my part, being willing to put out one of my own Eyes) as they &s;ay) to put out both his, that never had any. At every trip he
<PB N="19" REF="17"> made, he would be &s;ure to run his Nails into my Head, or make an Anvil of it with the handle of his Stick. It was to no purpo&s;e for me to &s;wear, I was not in fault, and that there was no better Way; this would not pa&s;s with him, he was too &s;ubtle to believe me.</P>

<P>MY Ma&s;ter leaving <HI>Salaman|ca,</HI> he de&s;igned for the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Toledo:</HI> and tho' Mens Charities were not very great, in tho&s;e Parts; yet being a wealthy &s;ort of People, he was led thither by the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Proverb, which &s;ays, <HI>That a Man had better have to do with a rich Niggard, than a Cha|ritable poor Man.</HI> We &s;teer'd then this Cour&s;e, pa&s;&s;ing always through the be&s;t Villages, where, if we found any Encouragement, we made &s;ome &s;tay.</P>
<P>At length we arrived at a Town called <HI>Almorx,</HI> in the time when they gather their Grapes, where
<PB N="21" REF="18"> my Ma&s;ter had a Bunch of excel|lent good ones given him; which he would have kept willingly till next morning, but it being very ripe, 'twould have been &s;poiled. He was forced therefore to eat it; and, to make me amends for the blows and ill u&s;age he had given me that day, he determined to take me in for a Partner.</P>
<P>We &s;ate down then in a &s;hallow gravel Pit, and he &s;aid to me, <HI>La|zarillo, come, let's eat this Bunch of Grapes, dividing them like Brethren; and therefore do thou take a Grape, and I another; but take no more than one at a time; and I, for my part, do promi&s;e thee to do the &s;ame.</HI> The matter was agreed on; but at the &s;econd twitch, the Old Knave broke his Promi&s;e, and be|gan to take 'em by two's, &s;u&s;pect|ing I did the like. When I &s;aw he infring'd the Articles, I did not content my &s;elf with doing as he
<PB N="22" REF="19"> did, but pluck'd Three at a time; and being by means of this expedi|tion, come to an end, he held the &s;talk wagging in his Hand; and &s;haking his Head, cried out, <HI>Ah!</HI> Lazarillo, <HI>thou ha&s;t deceived me: I can &s;afely &s;wear on my Soul, thou ha&s;t taken Three or Four at a time. Pardon me, dear &V;ncle,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>my Con&s;cience is as tender as other folks. Prethee,</HI> replied he, <HI>did I not ob|&s;erve, when thou &s;awe&s;t me eat Two at a time, thou &s;aid&s;t nothing? whence I certainly conclude, thou ha&s;t went beyond me.</HI></P>
<P>We were lodg'd in an Inn at <HI>Sca|lona,</HI> where he gave me a good fat Sau&s;age to roa&s;t for him; and ha|ving eaten the &s;lices of Bread, which he had put under it that the drip|ping might not be lo&s;t, he drew a &s;mall &s;pil of Money out of his Pur&s;e, and bad me go and fetch him &s;ome Wine.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="19">
<P>Occa&s;ion, as they &s;ay, makes the Thief; for there lying in the Chim|ney-corner a great Worm-eaten Root, which was thrown a&s;ide as not fit for the Pot; and the Blind Man and I being alone, I &s;hut mine Eyes to all that might hap|pen; and whil&s;t my Ma&s;ter was putting his Hand into his Pur&s;e, I whipt the Sau&s;age off the Spit, and dexterou&s;ly clapt on this Root in its place. I took the Money for the Wine, and gave him the han|dle of the Spit to turn; he roa&s;t|ing that Root, which was &s;o bad that 'twas not fit to boil.</P>
<P>I &s;oon di&s;patch'd my Sau&s;age, as I went for the Wine; and at my Return, found my old blind Ma|&s;ter &s;queezing the roa&s;ted Root, betwixt Two &s;lices of Bread, thinking it to be the Sau&s;age; but biting into it, and finding what it was, he fell into &s;uch a fit of raging, that he knew not where he was.
<PB N="24" REF="20"> <HI>What a Devil is the meaning of this,</HI> &s;ays he, Lazarillo? <HI>What!</HI> repli|ed I, <HI>I hope you have nothing to lay to my Charge, when you know I have been gone for Wine? &s;ome body has come in and put this Trick upon you. No, no,</HI> cried the old Fellow, <HI>I never let the Spit go out of my Hand; no body has touched it.</HI> I then be|gan to &s;wear, I was no ways con|cerned in the matter; but he re&s;t|ed not much on my Oaths and Im|precations.</P>
<P>He then ro&s;e up, took me fa&s;t by the Crown, and began to &s;mell my Breath: In the rage he was in, he did not the work by halves; but opening my Mouth with both his Hands, he thru&s;t his great &s;harp Snout down my Throat. The fear which I was in, by this &s;ud|dain &s;urprize, together with his Elephants Trunk &s;topping my Breath, made me ca&s;t up this undi|ge&s;ted Meat: What would I not
<PB N="25" REF="20"> have given to a been at that time Forty Foot under Ground; being in a wor&s;e condition, than half dead. My blind Ma&s;ter was now &s;o tran&s;ported with fury, that had not people entred in at the Out-cry, he had certainly &s;trangled me.</P>
<P>They drew me out of his Hands, which remained full of the little Hair I had left in our pa&s;t Com|bats. He told the whole Story, with all its Aggravations, to as many as would hear it; not for|getting the Adventure of the <HI>Pot of Wine,</HI> and the <HI>Bunch of Grapes.</HI> The Old Fellow related my prow|e&s;&s;es &s;o plea&s;antly, that, in as bad a condition as I was, I mu&s;t judge my &s;elf guilty of the greate&s;t &s;tu|pidity, &s;hould I not laugh for company.</P>
<P>But con&s;idering what had pa&s;t, I was extream mad at my &s;elf, that I had not bit off his No&s;e.
<PB N="26" REF="21"> My &s;tomach, without doubt, would have better retained that than the Sau&s;age. Our Ho&s;te&s;s and the re&s;t of the good Folks there pre&s;ent, made peace between us. They wa&s;h'd my Neck and Face with the Wine I went for; which made the blind Man joakingly &s;ay; <HI>This Boy co&s;ts me more in Wine for him in one Year, than I drink in two:</HI> Lazarillo, <HI>Thou mu&s;t own a greater obligation to Wine, than to thy Father: Thou hast received thy Life from him but once; whereas Wine re&s;tores to thee thy Life every day.</HI> Tho&s;e that heard him jear me in this manner, broke out into &s;uch fits of laughter, as put me be|yond all patience.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Of the <HI>Leap</HI> which the blind Man made.</HEAD>
<P>COn&s;idering the &s;tate of Affairs between us, I was re&s;olved of a long time to leave him; but this la&s;t Adventure fully determin|ed me. We went the next morn|ing to beg in the Town; and it having rained hard the night be|fore, we &s;heltered our &s;elves un|der a certain Gate, there to expect people as they pa&s;s'd by; but Night approaching and the Rain not cea&s;ing, the blind Man &s;aid to me, <HI>Lazarillo, this Rain is like to hold, for the darker it grows, the thicker it falls: Let us then return Home betimes.</HI></P>
<P>Betwixt us, and our Inn, there ran a great Canal, which was much encrea&s;ed by the Rain: I
<PB N="28" REF="22"> &s;aid to him then, <HI>&V;ncle, this Gut|ter is very large, but if it plea&s;e you, we will go a little further, where we may pa&s;s without being wet-&s;hod. Now thou art hone&s;t,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>lead me thither, for 'tis not good to take Water into one's Shooes this Winter Weather.</HI></P>
<P>Things being in this Order, I lead him from under the Gate, and brought him to a great Stone Pillar, and placed him directly be|fore it: The Rain fell with great Violence, and he was willing to be as &s;oon out of it, as he could. <HI>Now,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>&V;ncle, you mu&s;t make your Leap. But do you jump fir&s;t,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>Boy;</HI> which I did, and &s;tood behind the Pillar, watching him as a Man that ob&s;erves the Motions and Turnings of a wild Bull. I had no &s;ooner &s;aid, <HI>Come &V;ncle;</HI> but he, like a Ram, went backwards, and then came running, and leap'd with all his force, with
<PB N="29" REF="22"> his Head again&s;t the Pillar: I heard his Head &s;ound like a lea|thern Bottle with the blow. The blind Man fell down backwards half dead; and &s;eeing him fall, <HI>O, are you come,</HI> &s;aid I; <HI>You that have &s;uch a good No&s;e to &s;mell out the Sau&s;age, can't, it &s;eems, &s;mell a Pil|lar! Now, I believe, we are at &s;uch an even Reckoning, that we cannot ju&s;tly laugh at one another.</HI> I bad him, <HI>God b'w'y',</HI> and left him to the care of tho&s;e that came out to &s;uc|cour him; and &s;o tripp'd away, without looking behind me, ar|riving before Night at <HI>Torrigo;</HI> knowing not to this Day what was become of my blind Ma&s;ter; and indeed never much enquired after him.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI. Lazarillo</HI> enters him&s;elf into the Service of a Prie&s;t. His Ma&s;ter's covetous Humour de&s;cribed.</HEAD>
<P>NOT believing my &s;elf in Safety at <HI>Torrigo,</HI> I travel|led to a Village, at greater di|&s;tance, called <HI>Maqueda;</HI> where my Sins made me meet with a Prie&s;t, who &s;eemed to me to be the Curate of the Place; and in which I was not mi&s;taken. As I was about to ask him for an Alms, he prevented me, by demanding, <HI>Whether I knew how to &s;erve at Ma&s;s? Very well,</HI> an&s;wered I, <HI>Sir;</HI> for tho' the villainous blind Man, had ever u&s;ed me ill, yet this I mu&s;t &s;peak in his Prai&s;e,
<PB N="31" REF="23"> That he had taught me &s;everal u&s;e|ful things, and <HI>this</HI> among&s;t the re&s;t.</P>
<P>In a word, the Prie&s;t took me into his Service; whereupon I fell, as they &s;ay, out of the frying Pan, into the Fire. Although the blind Man was <HI>Covetou&s;ne&s;s it &s;elf;</HI> yet may I &s;afely &s;wear, that in compari&s;on of this Prie&s;t, he was a <HI>real Prodigal.</HI></P>
<P>He had a great ancient Coffer, to which was a &s;trong Lock, who&s;e Key he carried always a|bout with him, fa&s;tned to his Dublet, and when he returned from the Church, he would be &s;ure to lock up therein all the Bread, which belonged to the Poor. In all other Hou&s;es a Man &s;hall &s;ee &s;omething that is to Eat; a piece of Bacon (perhaps) hanging up in the Chimney; or, it may be, a Chee&s;e on the Shelf; or, &s;ome pieces of Bread lying up and down;
<PB N="32" REF="24"> or, Crums &s;cattered after Meals; but the Hou&s;e where I light into, would not afford &s;o much as the bare &s;ight of the&s;e.</P>
<P>He had only a <HI>Bunch of Onions</HI> kept under Lock and Key in a Garret, one of which in four Days was my Allowance. When I ask'd him for the Key for this oc|ca&s;ion, if any body was pre&s;ent, my liberal Ma&s;ter would lea&s;urely unty his Key, and very earne&s;tly bid me bring it him again quick|ly, &s;aying, <HI>Thou art ever minding of thy Belly.</HI> A Man would have thought in hearing him &s;peak thus, that he had had all the Varieties in World lock'd up in this Room; the and let me die, if there was any thing more than this wretched <HI>Bunch of Onions</HI> I mentioned, hang|ing on a Nail; the number of which he &s;o well knew, that 'twas impo&s;&s;ible for me to deceive him of one of them.</P>
<PB N="33" REF="24">
<P>After I had lived &s;ome time with him, I was ready to drop down dead with Hunger. What ever Fle&s;h Meat he eat, I was &s;ure not to get the lea&s;t Crum of it; perhaps he might be&s;tow a lit|tle of the Broth on me; but as for Bread, half of what was &s;uf|ficient would have made me think my &s;elf happy. On <HI>Saturday,</HI> he was wont to &s;end me to buy a Pi|teous Sheep's-head, which when 'twas boiled, he would eat the Eyes, Tongue, Brains; and clear all the Fle&s;h from the Cheek-bones; and having made this Ana|tomy, then would he &s;ay, <HI>Here take this away and eat it, and acknow|ledge thou ha&s;t made one good Meal in thy Life. I wi&s;h you may never fare better,</HI> would I &s;ay, grumbling &s;oftly to my &s;elf.</P>
<P>At the end of Three Weeks, I became &s;o weak, that I could &s;carce &s;tand on my Legs, and I was in a
<PB N="34" REF="25"> fare way to my Grave, had not mine own Indu&s;try relieved me. Yet had I been a Thou&s;and times more crafty than I was, what was there to exerci&s;e my &s;ubtilty on? Moreover this Prie&s;t was not blind, as my Old Ma&s;ter, to whom I taught the art of <HI>Leaping.</HI></P>
<P>He had Eyes to pierce through &s;tone Walls: When we were at the <HI>Offerring,</HI> not a Farthing fell into the Ba&s;on, of which he did not take account; he had one Eye on his Pari&s;hioners, and another on my Hands; &s;o that his Eyes were in perpetual Motion; and the <HI>Of|ferring</HI> being over, he took from me the Ba&s;on him&s;elf, and placed it on the Altar. By which means 'twas not in my power to deceive him of one poor Farthing, all the time of my Life, or, to &s;peak bet|ter, all the time of my Death, with him.</P>
<PB N="35" REF="25">
<P>He never gave me the trouble of going to the Tavern for him for Wine. He was &s;o exact, that the Wine of the <HI>Offerring,</HI> which he lock'd up in his great Coffer every <HI>Sunday</HI> morning, &s;erv'd him all the Week. To colour his in|tolerable Covetou&s;ne&s;s, he would &s;ay to me, <HI>That Churchmen ought to live in great Sobriety, and that others Example &s;hould be no Rule to him.</HI></P>
<P>But the Villain &s;poke again&s;t his own Con&s;cience; for when he dined or &s;upp'd at another's Table, he eat like a Woolf, and drank like a Fi&s;h. I never &s;o heartily prayed for the Death of People as I did there; for then, and only then, I was &s;ure to get my Belly|full of Victuals; and therefore did I earne&s;tly be&s;eech Heaven, to call every Day out of this World one of our Pari&s;hioners. When we carried the <HI>Extream &V;nction</HI>
<PB N="36" REF="26"> to the Sick, the Prie&s;t needed not bid me, as is cu&s;tomary, to pray for him; I was always ready e|nough to do this of my &s;elf; and I be&s;ought God, <HI>Not to di&s;po&s;e of him, according to his Will,</HI> as the Prayer runs; but, <HI>To bring him immediately into his everla&s;ting Kingdom.</HI> And if any one after this e&s;caped, Heaven forgive me, for I cur&s;t him to the pit of Hell: Whereas I accompanied with a Thou&s;and Benedictions, tho&s;e who were &s;o charitable as to leave the World. In all the time I &s;erved the Prie&s;t, which was about a Year, there died not above Five and twenty Per&s;ons in all; and I believe I occa&s;ioned their Death, by force of wi&s;hing it.</P>
<P>All went admirably well on days of Burials; then I might be properly &s;aid to live; but the&s;e times made the re&s;t but the more unea&s;ie; and therefore all my hope
<PB N="37" REF="26"> was now in mine own death, as it had been heretofore in that of o|thers.</P>
<P>I thought &s;everal times of leav|ing my Service, but was with-held by Two Rea&s;ons: The fir&s;t, That I could not tru&s;t my Legs; who&s;e weakne&s;s was &s;o great, that they were not able to carry me far: And the other, That having had Two Ma&s;ters already, the fir&s;t made me die with Hun|ger; and having left him for the &s;econd, he had brought me to the brink of the Grave; and &s;hould I leave him, and meet with a wor&s;e, he would certainly pu&s;h me into it. This con&s;ideration made me unre&s;olv'd; being more|over, &s;ufficiently enough per&s;wa|ded of my ill fortune, to believe, it would be wor&s;e and wor&s;e with me.</P>
<P>Another Rea&s;on al&s;o I had, not to leave him &s;o &s;oon; for he had
<PB N="38" REF="27"> already taught me to read; and beginning but newly my Writing, I knew not enough of that, to &s;erve me at my need; and I would willingly gain that Improvement by him, before I left him.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII. Lazarillo</HI> relates the Story of the Tinker's coming to him.</HEAD>
<P>ONE Day my Ma&s;ter being gone out of the Village; there came a Tinker to our Door, or an Angel rather, who ask'd me, <HI>Whether we had nothing to mend;</HI> I an&s;wered &s;oftly to my &s;elf, <HI>More than thou can&s;t do.</HI> But having no time to lo&s;e, I &s;aid to him, <HI>Friend, I have lost the Key of that Coffer you &s;ee there, and if you have one among&s;t that great bun|dle, which will &s;erve, I will pay you well for it, and you will do me an extraordinary Kindne&s;s.</HI> The Tin|ker, without further entreaty, began to try his Keys, and I, at|tentive all the while to what was doing, endeavoured to a&s;&s;i&s;t him
<PB N="40" REF="28"> by my Prayers, when on a &s;ud|dain, I was &s;urprized at the &s;ight of the Coffer's being opened. It &s;eemed to me, that the Heavens were &s;o al&s;o, at the &s;ight of the Bread, which lay therein; and addre&s;&s;ing my &s;elf to the Tinker, tran&s;ported with joy; <HI>Friend,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>I have no Money, but look ye, here's Bread enough, pay your &s;elf with your own Hands.</HI> He took then one of the be&s;t Loaves, and giving me the Key, went away contented, but not &s;o well plea&s;ed as I.</P>
<P>For that time, I touched no|thing; for &s;eeing &s;uch a Trea|&s;ure in my power, I was in a manner half &s;atisfied, as imagining that Hunger now dur&s;t not come within an Hundred Leagues of me. My Ma&s;ter returned, and fortunately took no notice of the Loaf, which was wanting. He no &s;ooner went out the next morn|ing,
<PB N="41" REF="28"> but I opened the ble&s;&s;ed Cof|fer, and taking thence a Loaf, I devoured it in a trice. I forgot not to &s;hut it; and I began to &s;et the Chamber to rights, with &s;o great cheerfulne&s;s, that I could &s;carce feel my &s;elf, imagining that now I could not but live happy|ly. I pa&s;t all that day, and the next morning, in the brave&s;t hu|mour in the World; but this la&s;t|ed no longer than the third day; when I &s;aw my cruel Ma&s;ter rum|maging, and feeling a Thou&s;and times in his Coffer; and begin again as many, the reckoning of his Bread. I made as if I was not at all con|cerned, during this trouble&s;ome &s;earch; but yet I recommended my &s;elf to God, and all the Saints. <HI>O ble&s;&s;ed Saint</HI> John, &s;aid I, <HI>blind him, I mo&s;t humbly be&s;eech thee.</HI> After a long Calculation, and reckoning the Days and Loaves on his Fingers; he breaks out into
<PB N="42" REF="29"> the&s;e words; <HI>In good faith, did not this Coffer &s;tand in a &s;afe place, I &s;hould think &s;ome body has robbed me of my Bread: However, I &s;hall henceforward keep &s;uch an exact Ac|count, that I de&s;ie all the World to deceive me in my reckoning; here's Nine Loaves and a piece.</HI> God give thee Nine Cur&s;es, &s;aid I to my &s;elf: Methoughts I &s;aw all my Blood &s;treaming out of my Body, when I heard him talk thus; and the fore&s;ight of the Diet to which I was to be reduced, made me &s;tarve before hand.</P>
<P>He went out after this; and I opening the Coffer to comfort my &s;elf, and kneeling down before the Loaves, I beheld them without daring to touch them: I counted them to &s;ee, if by good hap the Curate was not mi&s;taken, but I found him too exact to my Grief. All that I dared do, was to ki&s;s and &s;mell to each Loaf, and to cut
<PB N="43" REF="29"> extream thin &s;lices from one that had been much handled; with which I pa&s;t that day, but not with that Content, as I did the others.</P>
<P>And having accu&s;tomed my &s;elf to a greater Quantity of Food, for the&s;e Two or Three days, Hunger tormented me &s;o much the more: I felt my &s;elf dying; and when I was alone, I did nothing el&s;e but open and &s;hut the Coffer, and look on the Bread.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> How <HI>Lazarillo</HI> counterfeited the Mice.</HEAD>
<P>MY good <HI>Genius</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted me again in this urgent Ne|ce&s;&s;ity, by &s;ugge&s;ting to me a new Remedy. This Coffer is old, be|gan I to &s;ay within my &s;elf, and battered in &s;everal places, and the Holes and Clefts be not great in it; yet they are large enough to make it believed, that Mice may have entred it to eat the Bread. To take an whole one will ruine all my after hopes; but what hin|ders me from counterfeiting the Mou&s;e? I began then to nibble the Loaves over a Napkin, which lay in the Coffer. I thus nibbled Three or Four, and taking the Crums in the hallow of my hand,
<PB N="45" REF="30"> I &s;wallowod them like &s;o many Comfets.</P>
<P>Dinner-time being come, my Curate failed not in opening the Coffer, to perceive what had hap|pened; and attributed it to the Mice; &s;o well had I plaid my part. He then examines all &s;ides of the Coffer, and &s;eeing the Holes, through which he thought the Mice had pa&s;t, he called me and &s;aid, <HI>Look here,</HI> Lazarillo, <HI>&s;ee what Per&s;ecution has been rai&s;ed a|gain&s;t our Bread.</HI> I &s;eemed much a&s;toni&s;hed, asking him, <HI>How this happened? Whence &s;hould this hap|pen,</HI> an&s;wered he, <HI>but from the&s;e rogui&s;h Mice, from which nothing is &s;afe.</HI> He &s;ate him down to Din|ner, and gave me the parings of the Bread, and in giving them bad me eat, &s;aying, <HI>Eat, eat,</HI> Lazarillo, <HI>for Mice are cleanly.</HI></P>
<P>We ended our Dinner, if we may call that ending, which was
<PB N="46" REF="31"> never well begun. But I grew &s;ick, when I &s;aw the Curate &s;earching in all Corners for Nails, and little pieces of Wood, to &s;top up the Holes of the Coffer. O thought I to my &s;elf, how &s;hort are the plea&s;ures of this World? I thought I had found &s;ome miti|gation of my Mi&s;ery, when imme|diately he fell upon &s;uch an Inven|tion as drove me to extream de|&s;pair. Whil&s;t I was bu&s;ied in the&s;e thoughts, he had perfected his work. <HI>Now,</HI> &s;ays he, in a great heat, <HI>damn'd Brood, wretch|ed Vermin, you mu&s;t go and pil&s;er el&s;ewhere, live in &s;ome other place, for you'll find but &s;hort Commons here.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as he was gone out, I ran to the Coffer, and found he had not left the lea&s;t Crevice un|&s;topp'd. I opened, it though to no purpo&s;e; and &s;eeing Two or Three Loaves, which my Ma&s;ter
<PB N="47" REF="31"> had been picking, as thinking they had been gnawed by the Mice, I fell al&s;o on pinching them in the mo&s;t careful manner I was able. But the&s;e feeble &s;uccours being no|thing to my furious Appetite, my continual &s;tudy was how to provide &s;ome &s;peedy Remedy.</P>
<P>'Tis &s;aid of Hunger, that it &s;harpens mens Wit, whereas much eating does but dull it. One night when the&s;e thoughts made me re&s;tle&s;s, and I was de&s;igning a fre&s;h attack on the Coffer, with|out being di&s;covered; I heard the Curate &s;horing as he u&s;ed to do when in a deep &s;leep. I ro&s;e up &s;oftly, and making up to the Coffer, I a&s;&s;aulted that &s;ide which I knew to be weake&s;t, with a ru&s;ty Knife; which did not hold out long, &s;o that I made a con&s;ide|rable breach in it. I afterwards o|pened the Coffer &s;oftly, and &s;cratch|ing the &s;everal Loaves with my

<P>The next morning my Curate &s;eeing the Di&s;order, the Hole which I had made, and the Bread nibbled, began to cur&s;e the Mice in a mo&s;t extravagant manner; &s;ay|ing, <HI>What the Devil is the mean|ing of this, that the Mice &s;hould now of late come and torment us in this manner?</HI> And, indeed, he had rea&s;on to wonder at the Mat|ter; for there was no Hou&s;e in the Kingdom, that could pretend with ju&s;ter Title, to a Privilege of Ex|emption from the&s;e &s;ort of Ani|mals; who, for the mo&s;t part, love not to tarry where there's nothing to eat.</P>
<P>He began again to &s;top up the Holes, and I to &s;poil in the Night, what he had done in the Day.
<PB N="49" REF="32"> We each of us wrought &s;o hard, he in &s;topping the Holes, and I in making them, that in a few Nights and Days, the wretched Coffer was more laden with Nails and bits of Timber, than an Old Whores Face is with Paint.</P>
<P>Seeing he only lo&s;t time in the&s;e Repairs, he began thus to rea&s;on: <HI>This Coffer is but an ill compacted thing, the stuff of it is &s;o old and Worm-eaten, that the lea&s;t Mou&s;e can make an hole through it; and if I bu&s;ie my &s;elf in continually mending it, and the Rats and Mice in perpetually making holes in it, the Coffer will be good for nothing in a &s;hort time; however, as bad as it is, I am not willing to be&s;tow Three or Four Shillings on another. My be&s;t way will be to &s;et up a Trap in it, for the&s;e thieving Animals.</HI></P>
<P>He thereupon borrowed one, and baited it with bits of Chee&s;e, which he borrowed of his Neigh|bours,
<PB N="50" REF="33"> and kept it &s;till &s;et up in the Coffer. The&s;e were new <HI>Ragoo's</HI> to me, for though I need|ed not much any thing to &s;harpen my Stomach, yet this, together with &s;ome Crums of Bread, agreed very well with my hungry Appe|tite.</P>
<P>When the good Man returned home, and found his Bread le&s;&s;en|ed, the Trap without Chee&s;e, and no Mou&s;e taken, he gave him&s;elf to the Devil, and went a|bout the Town like a Mad-man; asking his Neighbours, <HI>How it could happen, that a Rat &s;hould eat his Chee&s;e fa&s;tened on the Hook, and the Trap fall without his being taken.</HI> His Neighbours a&s;&s;ured him this was impo&s;&s;ible, or, at lea&s;t, a ve|ry extraordinary Ca&s;e.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> How the Prie&s;t di&s;cover'd the Snake, and <HI>Lazarillo</HI>'s being turn'd out of his Service thereupon.</HEAD>
<P>ONE of my Ma&s;ters Neigh|bours, an ancient Man, told him, he remembred that his Hou&s;e was wont to be vi&s;ited by a Snake, and that very probably &s;he had made this Spoil; and though the Trap had fallen, yet her whole body not entring, &s;he might ea|&s;ily e&s;cape. This Neighbour's Saying, &s;atisfied the whole Com|pany, e&s;pecially my Ma&s;ter, who, from that time, never &s;lept &s;ound|ly; for at the lea&s;t Noi&s;e, he imagined the Snake was gnaw|ing the Coffer. He often leap'd out of his Bed, and with a great
<PB N="52" REF="34"> Cudgel which he held in his Hand, gave &s;everal &s;evere &s;troaks on the poor Coffer, to fright away the <HI>Snake.</HI> The Noi&s;e he made di&s;turb'd all the Neighbourhood; and I, for my part, was not to think any more of &s;leeping.</P>
<P>In this Di&s;cour&s;e of <HI>Snakes,</HI> he was told, that they loved Warmth, and therefore crept often into Childrens Cradles, &s;tung and even kill'd &s;ome of them. Ima|gining therefore the &s;ame thing might happen at his Hou&s;e, he would come oft in the Night, pull me out &s;ometimes of the Bed, and other whiles tumble me and it over one another.</P>
<P>I pretended for the mo&s;t part, to have been a&s;leep; and he would &s;ay to me in the Morning, <HI>Did&s;t thou not hear &s;omething in the Night,</HI> Lazarillo? <HI>I had a long Cour&s;e after the</HI> Snake, <HI>and I re|ally believe he hides him&s;elf in thy
<PB N="53" REF="34"> Bed; he's a very chilly Animal, and &s;eeks for Warmth. I wi&s;h,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>he does me not a Mi&s;chief &s;ome Night or other; for I am great|ly afraid of it.</HI></P>
<P>His fear made him &s;leep very little, and he kept &s;uch &s;trict Watch, that the <HI>Snake</HI> dared not ri&s;e to gnaw the Coffer, which ob|liged me to do my Bu&s;ine&s;s in the day time, whil&s;t he was either at Church, or abroad in the Vil|lage.</P>
<P>This Wa&s;te continuing without Remedy, put him on going the Rounds every Night about his Chamber, and to turn all things top&s;y turvy, to catch the Animal. I was afraid le&s;t in ran&s;acking thus the Chamber and &s;earching about my Bed and Clothes, he &s;hould &s;ometime or other meet with my Key; and therefore I thought it the &s;ure&s;t way to clap it into my Mouth, when I was to go to &s;leep.
<PB N="54" REF="35"> It was but very &s;mall, although it &s;erved for to open a great Coffer. Moreover, I had &s;o accu&s;tomed my Mouth to be a Pouch, whil&s;t I lived with the blind Man, that I could hold Ten or a Dozen Far|things in it, without the lea&s;t Trouble.</P>
<P>I put my Key then every Night in my Mouth, and &s;o &s;lept &s;ecure|ly, not imaging my Ma&s;ter would come and look for it there: But, <HI>when a misfortune is to happen, all means to prevent it are vain.</HI></P>
<P>One Night when I was in a profound Sleep, with my Mouth open; the Key, which was hal|low, lay &s;ituated in &s;uch a man|ner in my Mouth, that breathing into the hole of it, I made &s;uch a whi&s;tling, as rou&s;ed my Ma&s;ter, who thought it had been mo&s;t certainly the hi&s;&s;ing of the Snake: Holding then his Cudgel in his Hand, he made &s;trait to me very
<PB N="55" REF="35"> &s;oftly, lea&s;t the Bea&s;t &s;hould hear him. When he was near me, he thought certainly the Snake was in the Straw, and thereupon lifts up his Cudgel to kill her; but di&s;charged &s;uch a cruel Blow with all his &s;trength upon my Head, that I thought afterwards, when I came to my Sen&s;es, that he had given me my Deaths Wound. Un|der&s;tanding at length his Error by the Groans I uttered, he felt abundance of Blood i&s;&s;uing out of my Head, which made him ha&s;ten for a Candle; which he had no &s;ooner brought, but he &s;aw me groaning, and ga&s;ping with my Key in my Mouth; which taking thence and viewing, he perceived it differed not at all from his. But, for better &s;atisfaction, he went to try it, and &s;o found out tne whole Deceit. 'Tis hard to imagine what Joy and Triumph here was on this di&s;covery of the Snake,
<PB N="56" REF="36"> the <HI>Rat</HI> and the <HI>Mice,</HI> that had given this Trouble, and &s;o de|&s;troyed his Bread. What happen|ed the Three days following I know not, for I was in&s;en&s;ible all that while; but when I came to my &s;elf, I heard him declare the whole matter to as many as came to &s;ee him.</P>
<P>I wondred, being in my Straw, to find my Head &s;o &s;ore and full of Pla&s;ters, which made me ask the meaning of it: <HI>O!</HI> &s;ays the Prie&s;t, <HI>I'll tell thee, my Boy, the meaning of it, I have cha&s;ed away the</HI> Rat <HI>and the</HI> Snake <HI>that has done me &s;uch Hurt;</HI> I then im|mediately began to &s;u&s;pect the Matter. Then came in an Old Woman with &s;ome of the Neigh|bours to dre&s;s my Wounds, and being glad to &s;ee me out of danger, they began to repeat my Adven|tures, and make them&s;elves merry with them, which made me weep
<PB N="57" REF="36"> more heartily than they could laugh. In a word, at Fifteen days end I ro&s;e up, and could walk a|bout, being cured of my Wounds, but half dead with Hunger. The next day after I ro&s;e, my Ma&s;ter took me by the Hand, and led me into the Street, &s;aying, <HI>Laza|rillo, thou art now at Liberty, God be with thee, I have no need of &s;uch an ingenious Servant, thou mu&s;t certainly have &s;erved &s;ome blind Man.</HI> And therewith ble&s;&s;ing him&s;elf from me, as though I had been &s;ome Evil Spirit, he hyes him in, and bolts and locks fa&s;t the Door.</P>

<P>I Had not many pleas ready to offer my Ma&s;ter, and there|fore I took my leave of him, with|out much Ceremony; and craw|led towards <HI>Toledo,</HI> to which City I arrived by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of cha|ritably di&s;po&s;ed Per&s;ons.

<P>At la&s;t I met with a <HI>Squire,</HI> walking along the Street, in a

'Twas now about One of the Clock, when we ar|rived at a Hou&s;e, before which my Ma&s;ter &s;topp'd; then he throw|ing his Cloak over his left Shoul|der, with his right Hand draws a Key out of his Pocket, and there|with opens the Door.

<P>Being within, he throws off his Cloak, and having de&s;ired to &s;ee whether my Hands were clean,

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. <HI>How</HI> Lazarillo <HI>Dined with</HI> Duke Humphrey.</HEAD>
<P>HAving &s;atisfied the Squire's Curio&s;ity, by lying where I thought it advantageous, and concealing whatever might &s;eem injurious to me, he remained &s;ome|time, as it were, in a &s;tudy on what I &s;aid. I &s;tood before him all the while, with my Hands in my Hat, &s;wallowing my Spittle, and &s;taring on him in &s;uch a man|ner, as he might ea&s;ily gue&s;s I asked him, when we &s;hould go to Dinner, though I &s;pake never a word to him of it. 'Twas now Two of the Clock, and I heard no more &s;tir than if I had been in a Charnel-Hou&s;e. Moreover, this clo&s;ed Gate, this profound Silence
<PB N="63" REF="39"> wherein all the Hou&s;e lay, the bare Walls, and the Chambers, which I could perceive through the Windows, to be naked, with|out &s;o much as a Chair, or, &s;o much as a Trunk or Coffer in in them; all this, me thought, promi&s;s'd but ill, and brought a &s;ad Damp upon my Spirits.</P>
<P>The Squire came at la&s;t out of his &s;tudy, and &s;aid, <HI>Ha&s;t thou Dined, Child? No indeed, Sir,</HI> an&s;wered I, <HI>how could I, &s;eeing I have attended your Wor&s;hip ever &s;ince Eight in the Morning? For my part,</HI> adds the Squire, <HI>I had already Breakfasted when I met thee, and when this happens, as it does &s;ometimes, I have no Stomach to my Dinner, thou mu&s;t have patience then till Supper.</HI></P>
<P>I had in good earne&s;t like to have drop'd down at the hearing of the&s;e words, not altogether &s;o much for Hunger, as at the con|&s;ideration
<PB N="64" REF="40"> of Fortunes con&s;tant per|&s;ecuting me. At this in&s;tant, all my pa&s;t &s;ufferings came into my mind; and I e&s;pecially remem|bred the pre&s;age I had, and un|willingne&s;s to leave the Curate's Service, out of an Apprehen&s;ion of meeting with &s;ome Ma&s;ter wor&s;e than him. However, u&s;ing violence on my &s;elf, I &s;aid to him in the be&s;t manner I could, <HI>Sir, 'pray' be not troubled at that; I am, I thank God, of that Temper, that little eating &s;uffices me, and all the Ma&s;ters I ever &s;erved, will give me this Te&s;timony. Temperance is a great Vertue in a Young Man,</HI> re|plied the Squire; <HI>and I love thee the more for this: It belongs only to Swine to glut them&s;elves; and, in my judgment, Temperance, is the chief Note of an hone&s;t Man. I under&s;tand you,</HI> &s;aid I, within my &s;elf; but cur&s;t for ever be this Quality, &s;o greatly admired by
<PB N="65" REF="40"> all the Ma&s;ters I ever yet &s;erved.</P>
<P>I at length made off from my Ma&s;ter, and got into a corner of the Court, and began to eat &s;ome pieces of Bread, which were the remains of &s;ome good Peoples Charity. He coming upon me unawares, ask'd me, <HI>What I was doing there?</HI> I came and &s;hewed him the Bread, not being in a con|dition to give him another An|&s;wer, becau&s;e I had my Mouth full of it.</P>
<P>He took one of the be&s;t and large&s;t pieces of the Three, which I &s;hewed him, and &s;aid to me, <HI>In good faith, Lad, this is good Bread. It's too hard and dry,</HI> re|plied I, <HI>Sir, to be &s;o admirable. But I vow and prote&s;t it is,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>prethee who gave it thee? was it made with clean Hands, can&s;t thou tell? I took it,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>without any Enquiry, and I eat it as you &s;ee, without any Squeami&s;hne&s;s. God
<PB N="66" REF="41"> grant it be cleanly made,</HI> continued he; and putting it to his Mouth, he began to devour it with as great an Appetite as I did mine; &s;ay|ing at every mor&s;el he bit, <HI>This is admirable Bread, as ever I eat in my days.</HI></P>
<P>Ob&s;erving the ha&s;te he made, I thought good to ha&s;ten my pace, lea&s;t he having done be|fore me, &s;hould be &s;o kind and courteous, as to proffer me his far|ther A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>We both laboured &s;o well, that we ended together at the &s;ame In&s;tant.

<P>WE pa&s;t the re&s;t of the Day, he in asking me Que&s;ti|ons, and I in an&s;wering them the be&s;t I could; and Night being come, he made me go into the Room, whence he fetch'd his Pot of Water, and &s;aid to me, <HI>Come let's make my Bed, to the end thou mai&s;t learn how to do it in my Ab|&s;ence.</HI> I pa&s;s'd then on one &s;ide, and he on the other, and thus &s;oon made an end of the Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>This Bed con&s;i&s;ted of an Hur|dle laid over with two wretched Tre&s;&s;es, a &s;illy rotten hard Mat, and on that his Bed-Clothes, which, for want of wa&s;hing, dif|fered little from the Mat. We adju&s;ted all, however, as well as we could: When the Mat
<PB N="69" REF="42"> was &s;pread on the Hurdle, every &s;tick appeared like to the Ribs of a lean Calf: We &s;pread over on this a Coverlet, &s;uitable to the re&s;t of the Gear; 'tis hard to &s;ay of what &s;tuff it was. It being al|mo&s;t Night, <HI>Lazarillo,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>'tis now too late to go to the Market, it being a long way hence, and be|&s;ides, a Man cannot &s;afely pa&s;s the Streets for Ruffins and Thieves, who &s;natch off Mens Hats, Cloaks, or Swords in the Dark; let's there|fore pa&s;s over this Night, as well as we can, to Morrow, God willing, we &s;hall be better provided. The rea&s;on why I am no better &s;tored with Pro|vi&s;ion is, becau&s;e I have hitherto wanted a Servant, and am u&s;ed to eat in the City; but now we &s;hall keep new and better Orders. Sir,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>'pray' take no Care for me; I can pa&s;s very well a day or two without Meat. Thou wilt therefore,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>live the longer, if the Say|ings
<PB N="70" REF="43"> of Wi&s;e Men be true;</HI> That a &s;lender Diet maintains Health. <HI>Well,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>then, I believe I &s;hall never die; for I have always kept to this Rule, though again&s;t my Will, and am afraid mu&s;t ob&s;erve it for ever.</HI></P>
<P>After this he went to Bed, making his Ho&s;e and Dublet his Bol&s;ter, and cau&s;ing me to lie at his Feet, where I never &s;lept a wink; the hard Hurdle galling my naked Bones, which through Hunger and Sorrow, had but little Fle&s;h on them. I cur&s;ed then my hard Fortune a Thou&s;and times; and the greate&s;t vexation of all, was, I dur&s;t not change &s;ides for fear of di&s;turbing him.</P>
<P>When he aro&s;e in the Morning, he began to &s;hake and clean his Ho&s;e, Dublet and Cloak; I was his Bru&s;h, and &s;o he dre&s;s'd him|&s;elf with great lea&s;ure. Then I gave him Water to wa&s;h; and
<PB N="71" REF="43"> having Comb'd him&s;elf, he takes his Sword and ki&s;&s;eth it, and put|ting it on, &s;aid to me, <HI>Laza|rillo, did&s;t thou know the worth of this Blade, thou would&s;t ble&s;s thy &s;elf: no Gold can purcha&s;e it; for as many as</HI> Antonio <HI>made, he could never give &s;uch Temper to any as to this.</HI> Then drawing it out of the Scabbard, he ta&s;ted the Edge with his Fingers, &s;aying, <HI>Do&s;t thou ob&s;erve; I'll undertake to cut through a whole Fleece of Wool with it.</HI> Whereunto I an&s;wered &s;oftly, <HI>And I'll undertake to cut through a Six Penny Loaf with my Teeth, though they be not of &s;uch hard Metal.</HI></P>
<P>Then up went the Sword, which he hung at his Girdle, and &s;o march'd forth into the Street, keeping exact time with his Feet, holding his head up like a Turky|cock, throwing the end of his Cloak &s;ometimes over his Shoulder,
<PB N="72" REF="44"> and otherwhiles under his Arm, with his right Hand always on his &s;ide. At his going out, &s;aid he, Lazarillo, <HI>I go to Ma&s;s, in the mean time make the Bed, and &s;et the Chamber to rights, and after|wards go to the River and fill our Jarr with Water: But be &s;ure, whatever thou dost, have a care of the Door, for fear of Thieves, least any of'em rob us; and lay the Key in</HI> this <HI>private place, that I may have it, &s;hould I chance to return before thee.</HI> Having &s;aid the&s;e words, out he marched, with &s;uch a &s;tately Air, and Ge&s;ture, that a Man would &s;wear, who had not known him, that he was at lea&s;t &s;ome Grandee of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>Being then alone, I could not forbear lifting up my hands with Admiration; <HI>Lord,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>who looking on my Master's Countenance and Gesture, would think what a Supper and Lodging he had last Night,

<PB N="77" REF="46"> Voice; my Hands thru&s;t into my Bo&s;om, and mine Eyes turned up towards Heaven, and the Names of more Saints in my Mouth than ever were in the world; not fail|ing to &s;top at tho&s;e Hou&s;es, where there &s;eemed mo&s;t likelihood of getting any thing.</P>
<P>I had &s;uck'd in this Art, as I may &s;ay, with my Milk, learning all the Secrets of it from my blind Ma&s;ter; who was certainly the greate&s;t Arti&s;t in the World at it. I had made &s;o good u&s;e of his Le&s;&s;ons in this occa&s;ion, that before it was Four of the Clock, notwith|&s;tanding our Citizens hard heart|edne&s;s, and the bad Year, I had &s;ecured a pound of Bread in my belly, and twice as much in my Bo&s;om and Sleeves. I then re|turned Home, and pa&s;&s;ing through the Market, a good Woman gave me a piece of Neats-Foot, and a few bits of boiled Tripe. I found
<PB N="78" REF="47"> at my Return Home, my poor Squire, who had already folded up his Cloak; and having laid it on the Bench, took large &s;trides walking in the Court. As I came in, he made up to me, I thought to quarrel with me for &s;taying &s;o long; but, poor Man, he was of a more peaceable Temper; for he only asked me, <HI>Where I had been. In good Truth, Sir,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>I &s;taid here till pa&s;t Two a Clock, and &s;ee|ing you not Return, I have been a|bout the Town, recommending my &s;elf to the Charity of good People, who have given me what you &s;ee here,</HI> added I, in &s;hewing him the Bread and Tripe, which I pulled out of my Sleeves and Bo&s;om.</P>
<P>I knew this &s;ight rejoiced him; however, he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, <HI>Staying &s;o long I have dined; I do not blame thee; it's better to beg than to &s;teal: Only be careful of my</HI> Honour, <HI>and let it not be known
<PB N="79" REF="47"> thou belong&s;t to me. This is an ea&s;ie Task,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>for I have no great Acquaintance in this Town, and I wi&s;h with all my Heart, I had never come here. 'Pray', Sir, be not &s;olli|citous about this Matter; the World has other Employment, than to come and ask me &s;uch kind of Que&s;tions. Well eat then,</HI> poor Lazarillo, &s;aid he to me, <HI>we &s;hall be better accom|modated one of the&s;e days; for, to &s;peak the Truth, I believe this is an unfortunate Hou&s;e to me.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIV.</HI> He dines his Ma&s;ter, the Squire, as well as him&s;elf, with what he had begg'd.</HEAD>
<P>I &s;at down in the mid&s;t of this Di&s;cour&s;e, on an end of the Bench, and began to eat, to make him believe I was &s;till Fa&s;ting: When I beheld my Hungry Squire, though without &s;eeming to take notice of it, hold his Eyes fix'd on my Bo&s;om and Skirt, which &s;er|ved me both for a Table and Nap|kin.</P>
<P>God pity me, as much as I then pitied this poor Man: I felt his Di&s;temper as much as he did him|&s;elf; my experience rendring me &s;en&s;ible enough in the&s;e ca&s;es. I knew not whether I &s;hould invite him or not; for having told me
<PB N="81" REF="48"> he had dined, I thought he would make it a point of Honour to refu&s;e me: However, I was very will|ing to deliver him from the pain I &s;aw him in, and to impart to him what I had, as I had done before. Be&s;ides, I had better Chear to treat him with, and could better &s;pare it than formerly.</P>
<P>Both our de&s;ires were at length accompli&s;hed; for, having begun to eat, he made up to me in his Walk, &s;aying, <HI>I vow and prote&s;t,</HI> Lazarillo, <HI>thou ha&s;t the be&s;t Grace</HI> in Eating, <HI>of any man in the World; the bare &s;eeing thee Eat, will make a Man's &s;tomach return, though he dined never &s;o well but an hour be|fore.</HI></P>
<P>A very pretty Introduction, thought I; a body would think thy Hunger might &s;pare Apolo|gies, and make thee forget the&s;e Fooleries. However, to help him forward, I &s;aid to him, <HI>Sir, 'tis
<PB N="82" REF="49"> good Work, that makes a good Work|man: This is excellent good Bread, and this Neats-Foot &mdash; How, Neats-Foot?</HI> cried he, inter|rupting me, <HI>Yes Sir,</HI> replied I, <HI>Neats-Foot. If it be &s;o then,</HI> re|plied he, <HI>I have this to &s;ay to thee, Thou ha&s;t the be&s;t Meat in the World; and, in my Fancy, there's no Partridge or Phea&s;ant comes near it. 'Pray' Sir,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>do me the honour to ta&s;te it</HI> (putting at the &s;ame time the Neats-Foot into his Hands, between Two &s;lices of the be&s;t Bread I had) <HI>and you'll find in effect 'tis a dainty for a Prince, &s;o well is it &s;od and &s;ea&s;oned.</HI></P>
<P>He &s;ate down by me without further Entreaty, and began to eat, or rather devour, what I had given him, to the very Bones, which hardly e&s;caped the Fury of his Appetite. <HI>O!</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>what delicious Meat is this?</HI> The Sauce, thought I, wherewith thou eate&s;t
<PB N="83" REF="49"> it, will make every thing reli&s;h well. <HI>In good faith,</HI> added he, at la&s;t, <HI>I have eaten this with as good an Appetite, as if I had eaten no|thing all the day. I do not at all que|&s;tion it,</HI> &s;aid I to my &s;elf; <HI>a Man may &s;afely &s;wear as much.</HI></P>
<P>He bad me give him the Pot of Water, which was as full as when I brought it; and &s;eeing he had forgotten to drink, judge ye whe|ther he had remembred to eat. We pa&s;t over Eight or Ten days in this manner, in every one of which my Ma&s;ter failed not to go take the Air through the Streets, with the &s;ame &s;tately Mo|tion, and affected Gate, leaving me the Care of providing for the Family.</P>
<P>I often reflected on the Froward|ne&s;s of my Fortune; which ha|ving taken me out of the Hands of Two covetous Ma&s;ters, who &s;o &s;cantily fed me, had now made
<PB N="84" REF="50"> me find one, who was &s;o far from maintaining me, that I kept him from &s;tarving. Yet I bore him no ill will, but on the contrary hearti|ly pitied him.</P>
<P>I was fully &s;atisfied of his Mi|&s;ery. One day when he ro&s;e in his Shirt to go to the top of the Hou&s;e to ea&s;e him&s;elf, I felt in his Breeches, which he had left at his Beds Head, and found only a &s;mall Velvet Pur&s;e, in which there was not &s;o much as one &s;ingle Farthing, nor the lea&s;t &s;ign any had been there for this Ten Years. <HI>'Tis a poor mi&s;erable Wretch,</HI> &s;aid I; <HI>no body can give what he has not.</HI> 'Twas not the &s;ame with the covetous Prie&s;t, nor crafty blind Man, who made me &s;tarve, although God had given them &s;ufficient; it co&s;t|ing the one but a <HI>Pax tecum,</HI> and the other a <HI>God re&s;tore it you.</HI> 'Twas the&s;e Tigers I had rea&s;on to hate, for as to my poor Squire, in my
<PB N="85" REF="50"> Con&s;cience, I believe he would have been very liberal, had he had wherewithal. And truly, when I meet with &s;uch &s;ort of People in the &s;ame Garb, like Port and Gra|vity, I cannot but pity 'em; ima|gining they live in the &s;ame man|ner, as the poor Squire, my Ma&s;ter, did. Well, notwith&s;tanding the unlikelihood of growing rich in his Service, I &s;hould preferr the &s;er|ving of him a Thou&s;and times be|fore the others. Yet one thing there was in him which I could not approve of, to wit, his intolerable Pride and Vanity. I would have had him known him&s;elf better, and con&s;idered that <HI>his condition required other Manners.</HI></P>

<P>HOwever, this hindred me not from living quietly with him: But this Year happening to be a Year of great &s;carcity of Provi&s;ions, the Magi&s;trates of the City &s;et forth a Proclamation, en|joining all poor People, that were Strangers, to depart out of the City; &s;uch as were found there after &s;uch a time, being to be pu|ni&s;hed with Stripes. I &s;aw whole droves of poor People whipp'd out of the Town; and this, for a great while together, was the dai|ly, &s;ight; which &s;truck &s;uch Ter|rour in me, that I dared not run the hazard of Begging any more.
<PB N="87" REF="51"> Then might you have &s;een a &s;trange kind of Diet, and &s;ilence in our Family. We pa&s;s'd over Three days without eating a Bit, or &s;peaking a Word. It happened well for me that I had gotten &s;ome &s;mall Acquaintanee, with certain poor Women our Neighbours, who lived on Spinning and Knitting of Caps. They, ala&s;s, were not able to do much for me; yet that little they gave me, &s;aved my Life, and hindred me from Star|ving.</P>
<P>I more pitied my poor <HI>Squire</HI> than my &s;elf; for the Duce a Bit did this mi&s;erable Sinner eat, for Eight Days together at lea&s;t, as I know of. I cannot tell where he went, nor what he did; yet you might &s;ee him &s;ometimes come up the Street, &s;trutting like a Big Belly'd Woman, and looking &s;mi|lingly like a Man that had dined with his Prince. He would &s;tand
<PB N="88" REF="52"> at our Door with his Tooth-pick in his Hand, picking tho&s;e Teeth which had little need for any thing that had &s;tuck in them with eating; lamenting &s;till the unlucki|ne&s;s of the Hou&s;e we dwelt in; <HI>It grieveth me,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>to &s;ee how all our Sorrow comes of this Hou&s;e; thou &s;ee&s;t how dark and uncomforta|ble it is; and as long as we live here, we are like to be thus unhappy; would the Month were out, that we might get far from it.</HI></P>
<P>We lived in this mi&s;ery, per&s;e|cuted by Hunger, when one day, I know not by what Chance, a <HI>Ryal,</HI> (a piece of Money to the value of Six Pence,) fell into his hands. He came home as great in his own thoughts, as if he had had all the Trea&s;ures of the <HI>Indies</HI> in his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; he gave it me tran&s;ported with joy, &s;aying, <HI>Here,</HI> Lazarillo, <HI>God begins to open his Hand; go to the Market, buy
<PB N="89" REF="52"> Bread, and Wine, and Fle&s;h; and fea&s;t in &s;pight of the Devils Malice again&s;t us; and to compleat thy Joy, know, that I have hired another Hou&s;e; and that we &s;hall tarry here in this unhappy Abode no longer than the end of this Month. Cur&s;ed be him</HI> (continued he without giving me leave to An&s;wer) <HI>that laid the fir&s;t Stone for it. As I am a Gen|tleman,</HI> adds he, <HI>not a drop of Wine, nor the lea&s;t Crum of Fle&s;h has went down my Throat all the time I have lived here; neither have I had a Moment of Rest in it; &s;o that I believe hardly can a Man find a more dark, di&s;mal and &s;orrow|ful Place. Go, and return quickly; we &s;hall Dine to day like Princes.</HI></P>
<P>I took my <HI>Ryal</HI> and Jarr, and ha&s;tily bru&s;h'd along the Street to|wards the Market-place, with that joy, as is &s;carely to be ima|gined; and as I ran along, thank|ing God for the A&s;&s;i&s;tance he had
<PB N="90" REF="53"> &s;ent us, and counting on my Fin|gers, how I &s;hould lay out my Money, I &s;aw a dead Corps ap|pear, which was carrying to the Grave, attended by a great Con|voy of Prie&s;ts. I planted my &s;elf again&s;t a Wall, and after the Corps was pa&s;s'd by, I &s;aw a Wo|man in deep Mourning, followed by &s;everal others, who lamented in a mo&s;t piteous manner; And, the better to expre&s;s her Grief, I heard her &s;ay: <HI>Ala&s;s my poor Hus|band! whither are they going to car|ry thee? To the dark and di&s;mal Hou&s;e: To the uncomfortable and &s;orrowful Hou&s;e: To the Hou&s;e were they neither eat nor drink.</HI></P>
<P>The place of our Dwelling ap|peared to me &s;o exactly de&s;cribed in this Woman's Expre&s;&s;ions, as made me break through the Crowd, running down the Street, as fa&s;t as I could, directly Home, where locking and barricadoing the Door

My Curio&s;ity was at length &s;atisfied; for, being one day in better Hu|mour than ordinary, we having made a rea&s;onable good Dinner, he related to me all his Adventures. He told me he was of</HI> Old Ca&s;tile, <HI>and only left his Country, becau&s;e he would not be oblig'd to put off his Cap to a Per&s;on of Quality, his near Neighbour.</HI> But Sir, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> if he were above you by his Birth and Estate, as you &s;eem to acknowledge, you ought certainly to Salute him
<PB N="93" REF="54"> fir&s;t, without doing your &s;elf any injury; &s;eeing that on his part, he was not behind hand with you in Civility.

Truly, Sir, for my part, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> I &s;hould not have been &s;o rigidly exact in the&s;e Matters. Thou art but a Young Man, <HI>repli|ed he,</HI> and do&s;t not under&s;tand the&s;e Points of Honour, which are the only &s;tudy and concern of People of Quality. However, let me tell thee this, That though I am but a bare Squire, and &s;hould meet a Lord in the Streets, and he Saluted not me in as full and lowly a manner as I him, I &s;ay, in as full a manner, the next time I met him, I would turn into &s;ome Hou&s;e, feigning Bu&s;ine&s;s there, or el&s;e pa&s;s by and take no notice of him. Do&s;t thou

I remember, one day, I met with a Neighbour of mine, whom I had like to have run through the Guts; for, in meeting me, he gave me this Salutation, <HI>God &s;ave your Wor&s;hip, Sir. God &s;ave your Wor&s;hip,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>Goodman Log|gerhead; is this your way of &s;a|luting a Man of my Quality?</HI> The poor Man whenever he met me afterwards, would afar off down with his Hat to the Ground, and &s;o word his Complement, that I ne|ver afterwards had occa&s;ion to quar|rel with him.</P>
<P><HI>I could not forbear &s;aying to him here,</HI> 'Pray', Sir, inform me, where's the wrong, in &s;aying to a Man, <HI>God &s;ave you,</HI> or <HI>God give you Happine&s;s?</HI> Thou art a very &s;illy Fellow, <HI>an&s;wered he,</HI> in the&s;e Mat|ters:

<P>Neither am I &s;o poor, <HI>continued the Squire,</HI> but that I have in my Country certain Hou&s;es; which had

I retired into this City, expecting to meet with &s;ome good Fortune, but matters have not fallen out as I expected. I intended to have been Gentleman to &s;ome Nobleman; and I do really believe, had I light on &s;uch a one, I &s;hould have been taken into his Bo|&s;om; &s;o well could I di&s;&s;emble with him, and humour him: I would have burst forth into Laughter at the &s;orriest of his Jests, applaud|ed his Wit, though he had been the greatest Blockhead in <HI>Europe;</HI> ne|ver have mentioned what might di&s;plea&s;e him, though his Life and Honour lay at Stake: I would be

<P>THus did my Ma&s;ter, the Squire, lament his Ill for|tune, and &s;o plea&s;ed was he with this Di&s;cour&s;e, that he would have held it on till night, had he not been interrupted by an Old Woman attended by a Man; the fir&s;t came for Money for the u&s;e of the Bed, the &s;econd for the Rent of the Hou&s;e; both their Summs put together came to about Six or Seven Shillings; more Mo|ney than he touch'd in a whole Year. He gave them very good Words, telling them he was now going out to Change a broad Piece;
<PB N="100" REF="58"> &s;o that if they would be there at Night, they &s;hould not fail of their Money.</P>
<P>He went out indeed, but never came in: And his Creditors fail|ed not to come at the appointed time; but they were forced to put off the Bu&s;ine&s;s till the next Morning, it being late, and he not returned. I dared not to lie in the Hou&s;e alone, and there|fore went to the Neighbours, re|lated to them what had pa&s;s'd, and got a Lodging among&s;t them.</P>
<P>In the Morning the <HI>Creditors</HI> returned to pro&s;ecute their Point, enquired for the Squire among&s;t the Neighbours; but the Bird was flown. The good Women &s;aid to 'em, <HI>Here's his Valet, and the Key of the Door, and this is all we know.</HI> They asked me, <HI>What was become of my Ma&s;ter?</HI> I an&s;wered, <HI>I knew no more than they, he not ha|ving appeared &s;ince he went to change

<P>The <HI>Creditors</HI> hereupon fetch'd an Officer and a Scrivener, and taking the Key, they opened the Door in the pre&s;ence of Witne&s;&s;es to &s;ieze and apprai&s;e the Goods, that they might be paid; but, having, &s;earched all about the Hou&s;e, they found no more Fur|niture than what I have already mentioned.

<P>I was never &s;o terrified in all my Life, and therefore I promi&s;ed to tell them any thing. <HI>Very well then,</HI> replied the Officer, grow|ing now calm, <HI>give us a Categorical An&s;wer to what we &s;hall ask, and then you need not fear any thing.</HI> The Scrivener then &s;ate down on the Bench, to write his Invento|ry, asking me fir&s;t in general, <HI>What E&s;tate my Ma&s;ter had? Sir,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>my Ma&s;ter told me that he had a great deal of fair Ground to build Hou&s;es on; and, be&s;ides, a Dove-hou&s;e, but which is wholly ruined at pre&s;ent. Very well,</HI> &s;aid the Creditors, <HI>how little &s;oever, the&s;e may be worth, yet certainly here's enough to pay us. But where abouts
<PB N="103" REF="59"> in the Town is this Place?</HI> &s;aid the Scrivener to me. <HI>In his own Country, and not in this Town,</HI> an&s;wered I. <HI>Then we are all fair|ly fitted,</HI> replied they. <HI>And of what Country is he then?</HI> continu|ed the Scrivener. <HI>He told me he was of</HI> Old Ca&s;tile, &s;aid I. The Scrivener and Serjeant bur&s;t out into a fit of Laughter at this la&s;t An&s;wer of mine, &s;aying to tho&s;e that had employed them, <HI>Here's enough to pay us all, we need no more.

<P>In fine, after much crying and tempe&s;ting on both &s;ides, in the conclu&s;ion, the Serjeant and Scri|vener, loaded a Porter with the Coverlet belonging to the Old Woman. Although the Load, as may be gathered from what I &s;aid before of it, was not very
<PB N="105" REF="60"> great, yet every one bore a part of it; the Creditors and Officers holding each of 'em a Corner of it, and pulling and &s;triving who &s;hould carry it off, the weak|e&s;t being drawn away by the &s;tronge&s;t. I know not where they &s;etled to end their difference, neither do I know how 'twas at la&s;t deci|ded; yet this I dare &s;wear, that the Coverlet paid for all, it not being in a condition to hold out long again&s;t all their Attacks.</P>
<P>Thus did my Third Ma&s;ter leave me, whereby I perceived that For|tune went continually again&s;t me; for we &s;ee Servants every day leave their Ma&s;ters, but Ma&s;ters &s;eldom their Servants.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XVIII.</HI> How <HI>Lazarillo</HI> enters into the Service of a Friar, and after|wards into that of a Pardon-monger.</HEAD>
<P>I Was now to &s;eek for a Fourth Ma&s;ter, whom I found by the means of my good Neighbours, he being a Friar, and (as they &s;aid) of kin to them. He was a great Enemy to the Choire and Common Table; who loved only to gad abroad, and &s;ee the World; whereby, I believe, he wore out more Shooes than all the <HI>Convent</HI> be&s;ides. The fir&s;t Shooes I ever wore, I had from him; but, be|ing obliged to follow him up and down, I was pre&s;ently ready for another pair. Being not able for want of &s;trength, to endure the&s;e
<PB N="107" REF="61"> continual Marches, and accom|modate my &s;elf to certain &s;otti&s;h Humours of his, which I do not think fit to mention, though I thought good to leave him.</P>
<P>I afterwards pa&s;t over into the Service of a pretended <HI>Pardon-monger,</HI> a &s;pecial Rogue, if ever there was one in the World; having a Thou&s;and Tricks and Devices to put off his fal&s;e Ware.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he came into a Vil|lage, the fir&s;t Vi&s;it he made, was to the Curate, or his Vicars, to make them his Friends, by means of &s;ome &s;mall Pre&s;ents. Before he acco&s;ted them, he had an ac|count of their Abilities. If they were Scholars, then he would be &s;ure not to &s;peak to them in <HI>La|tin,</HI> but content him&s;elf with Complementing them in <HI>Spani&s;h;</HI> but if tho&s;e he applied him&s;elf to were ignorant People, then would he confound them with hard
<PB N="108" REF="62"> Words, and barbarous Terms, which neither he nor they under|&s;tood, whereby they gaped in an Amazement at his Learning.</P>
<P>When he could not put off his Pardons, by ordinary and com|mon ways, then would he have recour&s;e to extraordinary ones. He preached up for Two or Three days the great Efficacy of his Par|dons, in certain places belonging to the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Toledo</HI>'s Dio|ce&s;s; and though he forgot no Artifice to put them off, yet no body came to buy one of them, neither was there any likelihood of a better Market; which brought him into &s;uch fits of Rage, as made him cur&s;e and foam like a Madman. Yet at la&s;t, he fell on this Stratagen. He gave the Peo|ple then to under&s;tand, That he was on the point of Departure, and would therefore take his leave of them the next morning, after
<PB N="109" REF="62"> he had made the la&s;t Publication of his Pardons. He was attended (according to Cu&s;tom) by an Officer of Ju&s;tice, with whom he &s;truck into Play after Supper.</P>
<P>They pretended a Quarrel about a Ca&s;t, and thereupon fell into high Words. My Ma&s;ter &s;aid, <HI>The Officer was a Rogue, and he could prove him one;</HI> and he, on the other hand, affirmed, <HI>My Ma&s;ter was a Cheat.</HI> The fir&s;t &s;iezed on an half Pike, which he found near at Hand, and the o|ther clapped his Hand to his Sword.</P>
<P>At the noi&s;e which we made, the Ho&s;t and Ho&s;te&s;s, together with &s;everal of the Neighbour|hood, ran in betwixt them, who &s;trove in appearance to make a Rejoinder and kill one another. But the People which came in Crowds, drawn thither by the great noi&s;e which &s;ounded all a|bout,
<PB N="110" REF="63"> taking their Weapons from them, they afre&s;h began to in|jure one another with words; and the Officer fail'd not to call my Ma&s;ter Cheat, charging him with drawing up the <HI>Bulls</HI> him&s;elf, and impo&s;ing Counterfeit Pardons on the People.</P>
<P>There &s;eeming no likelihood of according them, the Officer, therefore, was carried to another Hou&s;e, and the Pardon-monger remained in the Inn, with all the marks of a Man highly provoked. The Ho&s;t and Ho&s;te&s;s, together with the Neighbours, u&s;ed all their endeavours to appea&s;e him, but to no purpo&s;e; wherefore they were forced, it being late, to take their leave of him; and &s;o we went to Bed.</P>
<P>The next Morning, my Ma&s;ter got to the Church, and there a&s;|&s;embled the People. Tho&s;e who had been Witne&s;&s;es of the former
<PB N="111" REF="63"> days Quarrel, fail'd not to publi&s;h what they had heard the Officer &s;ay; &s;o that every body now &s;u&s;|pected the Fraud. To hear the&s;e Villagers murmur, I thought our Affairs were ruined in this place, and I would have willingly told my Ma&s;ter as much, if I dared.</P>
<P>In the mean time came the Officer, a&s;&s;uring the people, there was nothing trurer than what he affirmed la&s;t Night; and that, of his Knowledge, the <HI>Bull</HI> was Counterfeited. My Ma&s;ter heard him with great Calmne&s;s, and let him &s;ay what he would. But at length lifting up his Eyes to Heaven, and af|terwards turning them on the Officer with Indignation, he pro|nounced a Cur&s;e on him as a Slanderer. Which proved &s;o weighty, that the poor Officer was thrown on his Back by it, with that violence, that the Pave|ment
<PB N="112" REF="64"> re&s;ounded again; when he began immediately to foam at the Mouth, and &s;pread out his Legs and Hands, to gna&s;h his Teeth, and to be in &s;uch Convul&s;ions, as affrighted all People from coming near him. Yet at length, the bolde&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t among&s;t them caught hold, &s;ome on his Hands, and others on his Legs. Never any Skitti&s;h Mule gave &s;o many kicks with his Feet, as this mali|cious Officer. There were above Fifteen Men upon him, and yet they could not Ma&s;ter him; and if he could but get an Hand loo&s;e, he would be &s;ure to take them over the Face. My Ma&s;ter was all this while in the Pulpit on his Knees, his Eyes and Hands lifted up to Heaven, in &s;uch an Ec&s;tacy, that all the noi&s;e in the Church, could not bring him to mind what was doing below. However, &s;ome compa&s;&s;ionate
<PB N="113" REF="64"> People came up to him, and pull|ing him by the Sleeve, de&s;ired him for the love of God, to try whether he could not by his Pray|ers, take off the Cur&s;e which he had ju&s;tly laid on this Officer, who had &s;o vilely and maliciou&s;ly Slan|dered him.</P>
<P>At length my Ma&s;ter &s;uffered him&s;elf to be awakened out of his Trance, and ca&s;ting his Eyes on them, &s;aith, <HI>To &s;hew that I for|give him, I de&s;ire we may all go together and pray for him; and that, if for his Wickedne&s;s, God has &s;uffered any evil Spirit to en|ter into him, it might plea&s;e him to ca&s;t him forth again.</HI> They all then fell on their Knees before the Altar, and having Sung the <HI>Le|tany,</HI> my Ma&s;ter came with the Cro&s;s and Holy Water, with his Eyes and Hands &s;o lift up to Hea|ven, that nothing but a little of the Whites appeared: Then did
<PB N="114" REF="65"> he begin a no le&s;s long than devout Prayer, wherein he de&s;ired that the poor Offender, who was &s;e|duced by the Devil, might be delivered from his Power and Ty|ranny, and re&s;tored to his former Sen&s;es. Then he &s;ent for one of the Pardons, and laying it on the Patients Head, he began to amend, and by degrees to come to him&s;elf. As &s;oon as he got up, he fell down on his Knees to my Ma&s;ter, beg|ging in a mo&s;t pathetick manner his Pardon, acknowledging, that whatever he had &s;poke again&s;t the Pardons, was at the meer in|&s;tigation of the <HI>Devil,</HI> who great|ly laboured to hinder People from receiving the benefit of them. In &s;hort, my Ma&s;ter freely for|gave him, and they were made Friends.</P>
<P>Hereupon followed &s;uch a Trade for Pardons, that neither Male nor Female, Young nor Old, in
<PB N="115" REF="65"> all the neighbouring Parts, but would have one. So that my Ma&s;ter put off near Ten or Twelve thou&s;and, without giving him&s;elf the trouble of Preaching one Ser|mon for that purpo&s;e. I &s;illy wretch as I was, greatly mar|velled at this &s;trange accident, believing with the People, that all this whole proceeding had been truly miraculous; till I heard my Ma&s;ter and the Officer laughing and joaking in private, at the Peo|ples &s;implicity: Then I plainly under&s;tood the Roguery of the whole Contrivance, and reflected within my &s;elf, how many &s;uch Cheats are u&s;ed in the world, to deceive the ignorant and credulous People. From that time I con|ceived &s;uch a Dete&s;tation at this abominable Cheat, that I could &s;tay no longer with him, and there|fore I left him, having been in his Service about Six Months.</P>

<P>I Afterwards &s;erved a <HI>Painter,</HI> who employed me to grind his Colours, but I &s;oon grew wea|ry of this Ma&s;ter: And being now grown to Man's E&s;tate, I endeavoured to find out &s;ome Em|ploy more proper for me; when entring one day into the Cathe|dral, one of the Chaplains ca&s;ting his Eyes on me, and liking my Looks, gave me an A&s;s in Charge, with Four Tankards and a Whip, to &s;ell Water up and down the Town, and this was the fir&s;t Step of my Preferment; for we had re|gulated our Affairs in this manner:
<PB N="117" REF="66"> I was to bring my Chaplain every day Six Pence, excepting <HI>Satur|day,</HI> which day I had to my &s;elf; and what I could gain be&s;ides o|ver and above my &s;tinted allow|ance.

<P>I after this betook my &s;elf to &s;erve, a Serjeant, but I was &s;oon weary of this place, for the dan|ger that attended it.

<P>I Had the Honour to be employ|ed by Mr. Archdeacon in the crying his Wines, who having a good Opinion of my Hone&s;ty, Married me with his Maid. I con&s;idered &s;uch a Match could not be any ways di&s;advantageous to me. The Wife he gave me proves a good Hou&s;ewife, and Ma&s;ter Archdeacon a&s;&s;i&s;ts and protects me for her &s;ake. He pre&s;ents us every Year with a Load of Wheat, and again&s;t good times, &s;ends us in &s;everal Joints of Meat, and gives us all his ca&s;t Clothes. He made us take a little Hou&s;e near him, and, for the mo&s;t part, on <HI>Sundays</HI> we Dine with him.
<PB N="120" REF="68"> Whence it is that ill Tongues &s;pare not to &s;ay &s;everal things contrary to my Wife's Honour, at which I am not at all moved, for I know &s;he's not a Woman that's fle&s;hly given. The&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es are &s;o common, that Mr. Archdeacon was plea&s;ed to take notice of them him&s;elf, &s;aying to me, before my Wife, <HI>Friend,</HI> Lazarillo, <HI>he that minds what every body &s;ays may do him&s;elf hurt, but no good.

<P>ABout this time the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> V. made his En|trance into this City with all his Court. I &s;hall not make any men|tion of the great Fea&s;tings, and other Solemnities for his Recep|tion. Whil&s;t he was here, I got &s;everal con&s;iderable Acquaintan|ces, going never without a Bottle of good Wine, and &s;ome of the Country Fruits, as a Token of my Trade. I by this means be|came acquainted with &s;everal <HI>Ger|mans</HI> of the Emperor's Atten|dance: And being not hated by
<PB N="124" REF="70"> the re&s;t of the World, I &s;aw my &s;elf &s;o born up, that when I &s;hould have committed a Murther, or fallen into &s;ome great misfortune, with the Friends and &s;upports that I had, I &s;hould come off Scot-free.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t my <HI>Germans</HI> were here, I re&s;orted to their Lodgings, and led them to &s;uch places where the be&s;t Wine was Sold, of which they u&s;ually drank &s;o much, that he who went alone into the Ta|vern, u&s;ually came out thence ac|companied by Four or Five to hold him up. That which I liked be&s;t of all, was, They would not let me &s;pend one Farthing, all the while I kept them Company. And whenever I put my hand to my Pocket, for Manners &s;ake on|ly, they would be ready to quar|rel with me; neither did we on|ly drink together, but always had &s;ome good reli&s;hing Bit; &s;ome|times we had a Joint of Mutton
<PB N="125" REF="70"> Sod in Wine, otherwhiles pieces of Bacon, or &s;ome &s;uch like Meats, with which they would not only Fea&s;t me, but give me enough to carry Home, to &s;erve my Wife and little Family an whole Week.</P>
<P>The good Chear I made, cau&s;ed me to call to mind the Hunger I had heretofore endured.

<PB N="132" REF="75"> Night; and the wor&s;t of it was, That I drank at my own co&s;t, &s;o that in Five or Six Months time, I &s;aw an end of what I had got|ten.</P>
<P>I minded &s;o little my Office of Cryer, that the profit I drew thence, was not &s;ufficient to bear half my Expences; when I want|ed Money, my Wife was forced to &s;upply me, to make me quiet. However, &s;he made no &s;mall noi&s;e on her &s;ide; and Mr. Archdea|con had &s;omething to do to pacifie us.</P>
<P>When I was in a condition to make u&s;e my Rea&s;on, I &s;aw I was not altogether blamele&s;s. I &s;ometimes therefore offered vio|lence to my &s;elf, and &s;taid at home for Three or Four days together. But then could I tarry no longer, being every where unea&s;ie but at the Tavern; having &s;o habitua|ted my &s;elf to tho&s;e Places, that
<PB N="133" REF="75">
'twas in a manner impo&s;&s;ible to leave them. Yet I had &s;o much good Advice, and &s;o &s;eriou&s;ly re|flected thereon, that I &s;hewed con&s;iderable Amendment, &s;o that I now kept at home for a Week together. But whatever care I took of my &s;elf, 'twas plainly &s;een that I did, as it were, force na|ture.</P>
<P>My Wife, who I am &s;ure loved me, could not &s;ee me long &s;uf|fer; and moreover we &s;eemed to incommode one another. Sitting one day in the Chimney-corner, &s;he and I alone, &s;he began to &s;ay to me, <HI>She plainly perceived this was not the Cour&s;e of Life I affect|ed:</HI> She therefore coun&s;elled me to follow my inclinations, to be merry with my Friends, and to leave the re&s;t to her.</P>
<P>From that time, I found my Pockets well &s;upplied, and Mr. Archdeacon and my Wife &s;o chang|ed
<PB N="134" REF="76"> their tone, that 'twas they that pre&s;&s;ed me to leave the care of the Family to them, e&s;pecially when they &s;aw I began to keep home. I did not pretend to dive into the rea&s;ons of this, and with|out Enquiries whence our Income flowed, I led the ea&s;ie&s;t Life in the World.</P>
<P>In the mean time my Wife was brought to Bed of a Son, and Mr. Archdeacon, who was his Godfather, <HI>loved him as dear|ly as if he had been his own.</HI> He daily &s;aid to me, <HI>That if he lived, he would &s;ee that he &s;hould be as well brought up, as if he had been his own,</HI> intending to make him his Heir. I admired the Kind|ne&s;s of this Man to a Child <HI>which was not his own,</HI> which made me &s;pend my days merrily, referring the whole care and conduct of my Family, to my noble Patron, the <HI>Archdeacon.</HI></P>
<PB N="135" REF="76">
<P>Thus happily did I live, till Mr. Archdeacon's Sickne&s;s di|&s;turbed our Felicity. He was &s;iezed with &s;uch a violent Fever, that in Three days time, he was reduced to the greate&s;t Extremi|ty.</P>
<P>His Relations, who laid claim to his E&s;tate, had &s;oon notice of it, and therefore came crowding in upon him; and though it might &s;eem, that their Intere&s;t &s;hould divide them, yet they a|greed too well for my profit. Their fir&s;t care was, to forbid my Wife and I an entrance into the Hou&s;e; and though the good Man often asked for us, they gave him &s;o well to under&s;tand, that he mu&s;t not any more think of the Things of this World, that he pa&s;s'd quietly into the other; we not having &s;o much as the com|fort of taking our leave of him, or without be&s;towing on us the
<PB N="136" REF="77"> lea&s;t token of his Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>One Misfortune &s;eldom comes alone. The Archdeacon was a Man in Authority, &s;o that he was not to be importuned for &s;uch a trifle as the hire of our Hou&s;e. It appeared after his Death, that there was Two Years Rent due. He that owed it was not of accord; that Mr. Arch|deacon had taken it for us, be|cau&s;e his Heirs would not allow it; and therefore he immediate|ly turned us out of Doors, and &s;iezed on our few Moveables for the Payment of his Rent.</P>
<P>Of &s;o many Friends wherewith I abounded Eight Days ago, not one appeared to help me in this urgent occa&s;ion, or, to give me &s;helter; and had it not been for a Charitable Lady, who took my Wife to Suckle her Child, and charge of mine, I mu&s;t immediate|ly have Mump'd about the Streets,

<P>WHat &s;hould I do in this ex|tremity? I knew no bet|ter cour&s;e, than to &s;eek my For|tune in the new World, &s;eeing the Country wherein I was born and bred, would not relieve me. This was a beaten road, it being no new thing in <HI>Spain,</HI> when Bu&s;ine&s;&s;es do not &s;ucceed, to go into the <HI>In|dies</HI> to repair what's wanting.</P>
<P>I re&s;olved then upon this Voy|age. I &s;old my Cryers Office to &s;et me out, and having taken leave of my de&s;olate Family, and ki&s;s'd an

I could not now endure hard&s;hip as heretofore; wherefore I made but &s;mall Journies, and Husband|ed my &s;tock in the be&s;t manner I could.</P>
<P>One day that I &s;et out very early, to advance on my way, I &s;aw a Man walk very gently before me, wrapp'd up in his Cloak. He wore a long Sword, who&s;e end peep'd through his Cloak, by a hole which it had made in it.</P>
<P>It was not yet the time for walking; &s;o that I was &s;urpriz'd to find in the High-Way a Man in this Equipage, which made me that I could not tell what to think of him, in the fear I had that he was there to Di&s;mount Pa&s;&s;en|gers. I Saluted him with a &s;oft Air, &s;aying to him, <HI>God &s;ave you,
<PB N="140" REF="79"> Sir. I forgive thee,</HI> an&s;wered he, without pulling his No&s;e out of his Cloak, <HI>for as I am accoutred, thou art not obliged to &s;peak other|wi&s;e to me.</HI> I was &s;urpriz'd at his an&s;wer, thinking it to be only a pretence to quarrel; but being will|ing to take away all occa&s;ion; <HI>It was not, Sir, my de&s;ign to give you any Offence,</HI> replied I. <HI>Be it &s;o,</HI> an&s;wered he very briskly, <HI>but who learnt thee to &s;alute Gentlemen, in this &s;otti&s;h manner? Let me die, if I do not think this</HI> God &s;ave you <HI>was brought into the World on purpo&s;e to drive me out of it.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e words made me look on him more attentively, and having begun to let down his Cloak, from his Face, I knew him to be the <HI>Squire,</HI> whom I had hereto|fore &s;erved. I was glad, for &s;eve|ral rea&s;ons, to meet him, and ap|proaching him, <HI>Is it po&s;&s;ible, My old Ma&s;ter,</HI> &s;aid I to him, <HI>that Six

<P>After &s;everal Embraces, and kind words on both &s;ides; he ask'd me, <HI>Whither I was going?</HI> and ha|ving told him; <HI>Thou goe&s;t,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>the &s;ame way as I; come, let's go to|gether, and relate to me what has befallen thee, &s;ince the night I was forced to leave thee, for rea&s;ons which thou mai&s;t gue&s;s.</HI> I gave him an exact account, without concealing any thing; and made my Hi&s;tory &s;o long, that we ar|rived, as I fini&s;hed it, at the Vil|lage, where we were to take up that Night.</P>
<P>I went for &s;omething to refre&s;h us: We knew one another per|fectly
<PB N="142" REF="80"> well, &s;o that he did not &s;tand to Complement with me, in putting his Hand into his Pocket.</P>

<P><HI>Having taken this information, I went to one of my Old Neighbours, and publi&s;hed my return into the Vil|lage. He that had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of my E&s;tate, was &s;urprized at it. He could not but know me; my ab|&s;ence had not been long enough to make him forget me. We came therefore to an accommodation. He offered to give me my board as long as I lived, or el&s;e to make me a &s;uitable Pre&s;ent, and thus I &s;hould leave him in quiet Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I accepted of the fir&s;t condition, yet without tying my &s;elf to any thing; however, I required, that I &s;hould at lea&s;t have the &s;econd place at his Table; that he &s;hould &s;alute me on occa&s;ions, &s;aying,</HI> Your Ser|vant,

<P>IT was not my real de&s;ign to go into the Army, and therefore a quar|ter of a League di&s;tant from my Village, I left the Road of <HI>Catalonia,</HI> for that of <HI>Madrid;</HI> where I hoped to make my Fortune with le&s;s dan|ger. For to tell the Truth, though I have worn a Sword all my Life time, yet I had never no great in|clination for Arms; and having ever had an a&s;piring mind, and great thoughts of my &s;elf, I there|fore ea&s;ily fell into the humour of the Grandees of our Nation, who think all Employs in War are be|neath
<PB N="146" REF="82"> them; and that 'tis mean to &s;erve in the Army. To make &s;hort, I arrived at <HI>Madrid,</HI> where I &s;old my Hor&s;e, and hired a neat Cham|ber, and began to view the Town.

<P>I had not taken two &s;trides, when a Lacquey came and pull'd me by the Cloak, telling me the Lady in the Coach de&s;ired to &s;peak with me. You will be &s;urprized, <HI>&s;aid &s;he to me, when I came near her,</HI> at the liber|ty I take: I know you are a Stran|ger, and I read in your Countenance, you are not a man to refu&s;e a credita|ble Employ &s;hould one offer it you. I thank'd her for her freedom, tell|ing her, This was what I &s;ought for
<PB N="147" REF="82"> at <HI>Madrid:</HI> That I was a Younger Brother, who had no great Fortune in the World, and that &mdash; You have &s;aid enough, Sir, <HI>&s;aid &s;he.</HI> I have long wi&s;h'd to meet with &s;uch a Per&s;on as you.

You'll have all things at your de&s;ire, a good Salary, a Foot|man to attend you, a Coach at your &s;ervice, and the pro&s;pect of farther Advancements.</P>
<P>I would have thank'd her; but &s;he would not hear me; you &s;hall thank me, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> when you have experienced the truth of what I tell you. Come up into the Coach, and we will talk further. What part of the Town do you lodge in? I told her, and &s;he made An&s;wer, Very well, 'tis thereabouts my occa&s;ions call me; I will therefore &s;et you down there. I ble&s;s'd a Thou&s;and times, in my mind,
<PB N="148" REF="83"> this fortunate Adventure, which happened when I lea&s;t expected it. She asked me an hundred que&s;tions in the Coach, and you may gue&s;s whether I could conceal any thing from my <HI>Benefactre&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>We arrived in the Street where my quarters were, and &s;he would needs go up into my Chamber, to &s;ee how I was lodged; and as I was about &s;eeking for a Candle, &s;he would not &s;uffer me. We can &s;ee clear enough, <HI>&s;aid &s;he, &s;miling;</HI> and I &s;hould be unwilling every body &s;hould know the freedom I u&s;e with you.

<P>I waited on her to the Coach, with that joy which you may ea&s;ily imagine. But no &s;ooner had I gotten up into my Chamber, with a light; but I found that whil&s;t this kind Lady had amu&s;ed me with the&s;e plea&s;ing expectations, her Lacquey had Ran|&s;ack'd all my Chamber, and left no|thing behind him, but what could not go into the Coach. He was &s;o careful as not to forget my Portmanteau, where I had put my Linen, and Wool|len-Clothes, and almo&s;t all my Money.

<P>This was, as you &s;ee, Friend <HI>Lazarillo,</HI> an ill beginning of making ones Fortune, <HI>continues the Squire.</HI> I remained only with Ten Pieces in my Pocket, and half of this Summ mu&s;t be laid out in repairing the di&s;|order, the rogui&s;h Lacquey had made in my Wardrobe.

<P><HI>Thus did my noble Ma&s;ter fi|ni&s;h the Relation of his Adven|tures, and I comforted him in the be&s;t manner I could; telling him,</HI> Seeing we were both forced to go &s;eek in the <HI>Indies,</HI> what Fortune had de|nied us at home, we ought to thank Heaven for bringing us thus happi|ly together again: That we might be a mutual help to one another, it being a great con&s;olation to have a Friend,

<P>A Fre&s;h gale filled all our Sails, and we were on the point of di&s;covering the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Coa&s;ts. I had gotten on the Fore-deck to be the fir&s;t di&s;coverer of that hap|py Land, which was then the only aim of my De&s;ires; and I with un&s;peakable delight ruminated in my mind on the plea&s;ure I &s;hould have in embracing my Wife and Children, after &s;o long a time as Three Years of Dangers and Fatigues; and that I might al&s;o
<PB N="153" REF="85"> impart to them &s;ome &s;hare of the little Fortune I brought from the place whence I came. I had to the value of Four or Five hundred Crowns in Money and Goods, with which I thought to &s;et up Shop, and with my Indu&s;try get an hone&s;t Sub&s;i&s;tence for my Fa|mily, which I intended to &s;ettle at <HI>Cales,</HI> as being the mo&s;t proper place I imagined for bu&s;ine&s;s. But alas! Fortune was not weary of per&s;ecuting me.</P>
<P>There immediately aro&s;e an horrible Tempe&s;t, which divided our Fleet. The Pilot and the re&s;t of the Seamen having yielded our Ve&s;&s;el to the humour of the Winds. We lay Two days between Death and Life, and the &s;econd Night we fell on a Rock. Although I could not &s;wim, yet I &s;tripp'd my &s;elf, that I might have le&s;s in|tanglements, if I could get hold of &s;ome Plank, which by good
<PB N="154" REF="86"> hap I light of, and was carried along the Shore, where I was taken up by Fi&s;hermen half dead, among&s;t the Mo&s;s and Sedges which grow in the Water.</P>
<P>The Shore, whereto the Waves had driven me, was di&s;tant from the Rock, again&s;t which we ran; the Plank whereon I held being all that came &s;o far of the whole Wrack of our Ve&s;&s;el. The Fi&s;hermen took me at fir&s;t for &s;ome Sea Mon&s;ter, my Skin being &s;o wrinkled, my Face &s;o disfigured, and my whole Body &s;o di&s;gui&s;ed by the Weeds, which were wrapp'd about it. Having well con&s;idered me, they perceived their Error; but the Fi|gure I then made, put a Project into their Heads, which they &s;oon after executed.</P>
<P>They made me di&s;gorge the Water I drank, which done I be|gan to breath. They then carried me into their Hut, where &s;ome
<PB N="155" REF="86"> hours after I rea&s;&s;umed my Spirits, and perceived my &s;elf naked, ly|ing on a wretched Mat, and &s;carce knowable to my &s;elf.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Fi&s;hermen had held a Council among them|&s;elves; and ju&s;t as I was about to give Thanks to Heaven, for ha|ving drawn me out of the Danger, which I remembred to have been in; and was mu&s;ing on my bad Fortune, in having lo&s;t in an in|&s;tant, what I had been gaining for Three Years together, with &s;uch Labour and Care; one of the Fi&s;hermen, who was the greate&s;t Rogue among&s;t them, came to me, and thus &s;aluted me: <HI>How now, Mr.</HI> Triton, <HI>do you know that you are welcome? What news from the re&s;t of your Brethren, the Sea Mon&s;ters? Who, I a Mon&s;ter,</HI> replied I? <HI>Do you not &s;ee I am a Man as you are?

<PB N="156" REF="87">
<P>Whereupon the re&s;t came up, and &s;econded what he &s;aid, &s;wear|ing 'twas true. I &s;wore again as fa&s;t as they, That I was a Man, and Son to a Citizen of the be&s;t Rank in <HI>Madrid;</HI> and further, That I was Married, and had a Wife and Children, <HI>'Pray' leave of arguing,</HI> &s;aid the fir&s;t Rogue, <HI>you are, and &s;hall be a</HI> Triton, <HI>and the mo&s;t hideous Mon&s;ter as ever was &s;een; and therefore hold thy Peace, and be quiet unle&s;s you're minded to be pick'ed up for Cod-fi&s;h.</HI> I was about to reply, but the Fi&s;herman began to take up his Knife, as it were to execute in earne&s;t what he had threatned; whereupon, &s;eeing no remedy, I re&s;olved to be what they would have me, <HI>Triton,</HI> Mon&s;ter or Red-Herring, if they pleas'd.</P>
<P>Yet I could not divine all this while whereunto this tended; but I was &s;oon &s;atisfied, when I &s;aw
<PB N="157" REF="87"> my Ma&s;ters come to me with a Tub full of Water. They &s;wad|led me up in Mo&s;s and other Herbs, tying me down with a Cord, ha|ving nothing but my Head at li|berty, &s;o that a &s;tranger Figure could not appear. They covered my Head with mo&s;&s;y Leaves, and made me a long Beard with Hor&s;e hair; and thus dre&s;&s;ed up, they laid me on my Belly in the Tub, which was flat and of an Oval form, making appear at the end of my Legs a <HI>Triton</HI>'s Tail which they had adju&s;ted. They had al&s;o fa&s;tned a Rope on my Feet, one end of which came out through a leaden pipe, &s;o that if I offered to &s;peak or grumble never &s;o little, they needed only pull the Rope, and I was forced to plunge like a Duck.</P>
<P>Having put all their machins in order, They gave out, they had taken a <HI>Triton;</HI> and &s;o many Peo|ple
<PB N="158" REF="88"> round about came that day to &s;ee me, that though the Fi&s;hermen took but Pence a piece, this amounted to a con&s;iderable Summ. I would have &s;poken when my Spectators began to throng about me, but he that was &s;peaker to the Show, and &s;ate on the &s;ide of the Tub, draw|ing the Cord, every time I at|tempted to open my Mouth, duck'd my Head in the Water, &s;o that I was forced to be &s;ilent, for fear of drowning.</P>
<P>My Ma&s;ters ravi&s;h'd to &s;ee their Project take &s;o well, and encou|raged by the Gain they found; carried me through all the Towns and Villages of <HI>Spain,</HI> in a Cart. One of the&s;e Fi&s;hermen was the Carter, and the other &s;ate in it to take care to pull the Rope, if I offered to &s;peak, when we met any body. They only permitted me to u&s;e my Tongue, when we were alone.</P>
<PB N="159" REF="88">
<P>I ask'd them one Day, what the Devil they meant in thus Tyranni|zing over me. <HI>You know in your own Con&s;cience,</HI> &s;aid I to them, <HI>that I am a Man, endued with &s;en&s;e as well as your &s;elves; if you keep me long in this &s;tinking Water I &s;hall certainly peri&s;h.

Being a Fi&s;h, as thou art, thou can&s;t not live an Hour out of the Water without ex|tream peril of Death; thou oughte&s;t therefore to be thankful for having fallen into &s;uch Hands as ours, who know what belongs to Sea Mon&s;ters.</HI> I had nothing to reply; and &s;o much the le&s;s, becau&s;e I felt al|ready, he began to twitch the Cord, to convince me of the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of my &s;ilence; &s;o that I was forced to be contented, to be a Fi&s;h, till &s;uch time as Heaven
<PB N="160" REF="89"> &s;hould free me from the hands of the&s;e Villains.</P>
<P>They had the impudence to carry me to <HI>Madrid,</HI> but they re|mained not there long. The fir&s;t who came to &s;ee me were Scholars. Having examined me a little more curiou&s;ly than the Country peo|ple, there was one who &s;aid, <HI>In good Faith, he is as much a</HI> Triton, <HI>as I am one; were I an Officer of</HI> Ju&s;tice, <HI>I &s;hould &s;end both the Fi&s;h|ermen and Fi&s;h too to the Galleys, having fir&s;t made 'em fetch a walk about the Town, in the manner as they de&s;erve.</HI> Alas, &s;aid I to my &s;elf, I would willingly be quit for a Thou&s;and La&s;hes, and Ten Years &s;ervice in the Galleys; for I &s;hould &s;uffer le&s;s than I do now. In the mean time this Di&s;cour&s;e alarm'd my Conductors; they apprehended le&s;t &s;ome others &s;hould rea&s;on as clearly as the Scho|lars had done; wherefore they left
<PB N="161" REF="89"> the Town the &s;ame Day, to carry me into the Villages, where the People would be more ea&s;ily impo|&s;ed on.</P>
<P>They at length carried me to <HI>Toledo.</HI> They hired a Ground|room in the very Hou&s;e, wherein I had heretofore lived. All the Town came hither, and I was (you may well think) in a &s;trange taking, to &s;ee my Wife, with lit|tle <HI>Tere&s;a,</HI> among&s;t the re&s;t who was then about Five or Six Years Old, and who appeared to me pret|ty, like an Angel. This fight made &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions on my Heart, that I fell into a Swoon with my Head into the Water; the Fi&s;her|men perceived it, and having cleared the Room of Folks, they emptied the Tub, and took all po&s;&s;ible care for my pre&s;ervation, they being &s;o greatly intere&s;s'd in it. But all &s;eemed in vain, and they thought me dead.</P>
<PB N="162" REF="90">
<P>The fear they had, lea&s;t my Death &s;hould di&s;cover their Ro|guery, made them re&s;olve to throw me by Night into the River, and &s;o to march off. They laid me then athwart one of the Mules, which &s;erved to draw their Cart. The jogging of the Mule made me di&s;|gorge the Water I had &s;wallowed, and come to my Sen&s;es; I under|&s;tood they talk'd about throwing me into the River; &s;eeing the danger I was in, I began to call out for help with all my force, and to cry Murther. The Watch, by good hap, was pa&s;&s;ing through the next Street. They &s;urrounded us in an in&s;tant, and carried us all to Pri&s;on.</P>
<P>We were que&s;tioned the next Morning, and I was known for what I was. The Fi&s;hermen were puni&s;hed, and the Money they had gotten confi&s;cated, one third to the King, the other to the

<HEAD>THE LIFE AND DEATH OF Young <HI>LAZARILLO.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HAVING thus given you a perfect Relation of the Life and Death of the Fa|ther and the Mother, it would be an Inju&s;tice to their Memory, to &s;ay nothing of that &s;ame Sprigg of Iniquity which they left behind. For, that they had a Son between
<PB N="172" REF="95"> them (I mean, <HI>Lazarillo,</HI> and his beloved Spou&s;e or Doxie, no mat|ter whether) all the <HI>Gu&s;manick, Bu&s;conick, Scarronick</HI> Writers a|gree; more e&s;pecially, <HI>The Chief Remembrancer to the Knights of the Order of Indu&s;try,</HI> in his Lives of the Sons and Daughters of Joy, expre&s;ly affirms it. Moreover, he gives &s;everal Rea&s;ons to a&s;&s;ure us, that he was the Father's and Mother's nown Child; and, that for once, his Mother did conceive without the help of Interlopers. For he &s;ays, that the Child did &s;o partake of the natural Di&s;po&s;ition and <HI>Genius</HI> of his Father and Mo|ther, that he might well be call'd a Chipp of the Old Block. The Infant was &s;o far from being only naturally enclined to Thievery after he was born, that he began to &s;tudy it in his Mother's Womb, and &s;o &s;tole him&s;elf into the World. 'Tis true, he did not couzen the
<PB N="173" REF="95"> World as <HI>Garagantua</HI> did; that is to &s;ay, he did not &s;lip through his Mother's <HI>Cotyledons,</HI> into the Hollow Vein, and by that means cro&s;&s;ing the <HI>Diaphragma,</HI> a&s;cend as far as the Shoulders, where that Vein parts in two; and &s;o turn|ing to the left Hand, creep out at his Mother's left Ear. No; but he came &s;o &s;lily into the World, that he was half out before his Mother perceived him; who was delivered of a &s;udden, to her great &s;atisfaction, without the help of Midwife or Nur&s;e, or any other Woman to a&s;&s;i&s;t her. And indeed, he would have been a True Son of <HI>Mercury,</HI> had not an untimely Accident cut him off in the Bloom of his Years, at which you will either Laugh or Weep, when we &s;hall come to relate it.</P>
<P>He was not &s;o forward as <HI>Her|cules,</HI> to Kill Snakes in his Cradle. Good rea&s;on for that; for, <HI>Jupiter</HI>
<PB N="174" REF="96"> was Eight and forty Hours a get|ting him; and the Poet &s;ays, his Deity&s;hip was forced to drudge hard too; and therefore we &s;hall not tell you, what our Young&s;ter did, before he had bred the full number of his Teeth. But no &s;ooner could he &s;peak, but his Father beholding the vigour and &s;prightline&s;s of his Son, thought there &s;hould be nothing wanting on his part; and therefore know|ing the Importance of early In|&s;tructions, he began to tutour him between his Knees, telling him, That the Profe&s;&s;ion of a Thief was one of the Liberal Sci|ences, and did not at all reli&s;h of <HI>Mechanick,</HI> though indeed there were &s;omewhat in that, required the nimblene&s;s and &s;light of Hand; that they who went by the Names oft hone&s;te&s;t Men, made it now adays the greate&s;t part of their Calling; &s;o that whoever did not
<PB N="175" REF="96"> know how to &s;teal, knew not how to live in the World. And therefore (quoth his Father pro|ceeding) why do the Serjeants and Bayliffs &s;o pro&s;ecute us? Only be|cau&s;e one Trade envies another, Why do they Whipp, why Bani&s;h and Hang us up, but becau&s;e they will not &s;uffer any Thieves but them&s;elves to live among them? However, good In&s;tructions and Craft do many times deliver us out of their Clutches. In my Youth (quoth the Old Man) I u&s;ually haunted the Churches and other Places of Publick Meeting, and then &s;ometimes I happened to be &s;napp'd; yet &s;till I got off by my Wits, which were always good at a dead lift. And therefore, my Son (quoth he) keep Wit in thy Brains, and that will keep Money in thy Pocket.</P>
<P>You cannot think how deep the&s;e In&s;tructions &s;ank into the little
<PB N="176" REF="97"> Noddle of Young <HI>Lazarillo,</HI> and throve like <HI>Jeru&s;alem Artichoaks</HI> in a fat Garden; &s;o that he could no &s;ooner make a Ca&s;ting Topp Spin, but he began to &s;hew his Gifts. For, at Eight Years of Age, he was able to have cheated at Cards or Dice, all the Footmen that belong to the <HI>Hou&s;e of Com|mons;</HI> and was fit to have been Captain of the <HI>Black Guard,</HI> that rogue about the Guards near <HI>White|hall.</HI> More particularly, he was the Inventor of that &s;tratagemi|cal Way of Cheating, or rather, robbing the Cu&s;tard Women in the open &s;treet at noon Day; Which was thus performed; So &s;oon as he heard the Voice of the Cu&s;tard-woman &s;etting up her Throat, and bawlling out, <HI>Cu&s;tards, large Custards, Groats a piece,</HI> up he comes with her, and bids her &s;hew him a couple of Cu&s;tards; both the&s;e he takes, and while he
<PB N="177" REF="97"> is poi&s;ing them upon the Palm of his Hands to try which is the be&s;t, pre&s;ently comes another Boy of the Confederacy, well in&s;tru|cted before-hand, and &s;eeing him weighing the Cu&s;tards &s;o bu&s;ily, <HI>What are you doing here?</HI> quoth he, <HI>Doing!</HI> cries the other, <HI>Why I am going to buy one of the&s;e Custards; which &s;hall I take?&mdash;Oh ye Rogue,</HI> quoth the Boy, <HI>buying Custards, and your Grandfather dead! My Grandfather dead!</HI> crys t'other; and, as it were in a &s;trange A|mazement, clapping both the Cu|&s;tards together, runs away with them both as hard as he can drive; while the poor Woman &s;urpriz'd, has neither time to follow, nor time to cry out, till the Young Rogues are got with their Plunder quite out of &s;ight.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time there was a Co&s;termonger, that took up his
<PB N="178" REF="98"> &s;tand in an Evening after Candle|light, before the entrance into a Church, at a good di&s;tance from the Hou&s;es on each &s;ide; only for his own u&s;e the Co&s;termonger had a Candle in a paper Lanthorn &s;tuck at one &s;ide of his Basket. This Young <HI>Lazarillo</HI> ob&s;erving, when he had a mind to fill his own and his Companions Bellies with Fruit, order'd his Gang to follow him. And being furni&s;h|ed with three or four good &s;tones, when he came within reach of the Co&s;termonger's Paper-Lanthorn, at it he lets drive with his unlucky Hand, but if he mi&s;t the fir&s;t hit, at the &s;econd he was &s;ure to fetch down the Candle and extingui&s;h the Light; and then it was that the Co&s;termonger being in the dark, that <HI>Lazarillo</HI> and his fol|lowers had their Opportunity to fill their Pockets, and vani&s;h be|fore the Co&s;termonger could light
<PB N="179" REF="98"> his Candle, to &s;ee who had hurt him, or what Lo&s;&s;es had befallen him.</P>
<P>A Barber ob&s;erving this Toward|line&s;s in <HI>Young Lazarillo;</HI> &s;ays he to him&s;elf, <HI>This Boy may do me great &s;ervice.</HI> Now this Barber, as he was a great Friend and Neigh|bour of <HI>Old Lazarillo</HI>'s, &s;o was he a very arrant <HI>Felon.</HI> Therefore, to fit <HI>Young Lazarillo</HI> for his pur|po&s;e, he &s;ent him to the Pick|pocket School, where the Young Rogue profited &s;o well in a &s;hort time, that he was able to out-do many of his Seniors in that Trade; &s;o that had there been degrees in the Art of <HI>Pocket-picking,</HI> as there are in the Sciences of <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Phy|&s;ick,</HI> he might have Commenc'd <HI>Master of Arts</HI> in half a Years time. Nor did the Barber repent him of his Charity, in putting <HI>Young Lazarillo</HI> out. For, the Barber having got a Trick, when
<PB N="180" REF="99"> he trimmed his Cu&s;tomers, to fill their Eyes full of Camphire Sudds, again&s;t which their only Remedy was to keep their Eyes clo&s;e &s;hut, <HI>Young Lazarillo</HI> was &s;till at hand to open their Pockets, and take much out of more, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> out of little, to the great Be|nefit of the Barber, who by that means doubly, &s;ometimes trebly paid for his Trimming.</P>
<P>At about ten Years of Age, <HI>Young Lazarillo</HI> was put to an ordinary Grammar School in the Country, one of tho&s;e that teach Latin in|deed, but no higher than <HI>Ovid</HI>'s <HI>Metamorpho&s;is,</HI> or <HI>Virgil's Eneads.</HI> While he remained there, his u&s;u|al Practice was, to &s;ecure all the Books that came in his Way; and, that his little Thefts might pa&s;s undi&s;cover'd, before he expo&s;ed his Thieveries to &s;ale, he would &s;o &s;trangely alter their Complexi|ons, that they could never be
<PB N="181" REF="99"> known. If they were new, he would rub their Covers in the A&s;hes; if the Leaves were red, he would alter their Colour into blew or green, or whatever other Colour he could get, for which he had his Uten&s;ils and Materials al|ways by him; or, if old, he would renew their old Faces with fre&s;h Painting. As for his Mo|ney, he had various ways to &s;pend it, in treating and care&s;&s;ing tho&s;e Boys that were able to make his Exerci&s;es, which render'd him ve|ry acceptable to his Ma&s;ter. How|ever, he would often play the Tru|ant, and tho&s;e Truantings were always attended with &s;ome noto|rious piece of Roguery, as Rob|bing of Orchards, Milking the Cows in his Hat, Robbing of Hen-Roo&s;ts, and dimini&s;hing the number of the Farmers Gee&s;e. To which purpo&s;e, he had a &s;hort &s;tick with a &s;tring ty'd to the end
<PB N="182" REF="100"> of it, and a Bullet at the end of that, which would fetch in his Game by the Neck; about which, the Weight of the Bullet twi&s;ted the String &s;o many times, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for the Gee&s;e to di&s;ingage them&s;elves from De|&s;truction. Now, whatever he got, he carry'd to a Hou&s;e, which encouraged him in his Roguery, gave him two Pence for what was worth a Shilling, and fea&s;ted him to boot.</P>
<P>In his rovings, while a mere griftly Bratt, he was very &s;evere; &s;o that if a &s;tronger Boy than him|&s;elf had injur'd him, he would conceal his Re&s;entment, and ex|erci&s;e his Revenge upon him privately; and one Trick he had among the re&s;t for the &s;ame pur|po&s;e, which was, to &s;tick a Pin in the Seat where the Boy was to &s;it.</P>
<P>Another time, one of the Maids having cro&s;s'd him; to be reveng'd
<PB N="183" REF="100"> of her, knowing her to be a drou|&s;y Wench, as &s;he &s;lept by the fire, <HI>Young Lazarillo</HI> took his Oppor|tunity, and having melted a little Glew, gently touch'd the clo&s;ure of both her Eye-lids with a Pencil, and when he thought it cold, he &s;uddenly wak'd the Wench, pre|tending that her Mi&s;tre&s;s call'd her, having fir&s;t &s;et all the Chairs and Stools about the Kitchin in her Way. Pre&s;ently up &s;tarts the Wench, and rubbing her Eyes, away &s;he hurries, but, being blindfold, in her ha&s;te, here &s;he tumbles over the Chairs, there o|ver the Stools; up went her Heels, and up flew her Petty-Coats before and behind, to the great &s;atisfacti|on of <HI>Young Lazarillo,</HI> who was extreamly delighted with this piece of Roguery. On the other &s;ide, the Wench would hardly be per&s;waded, but that it was a Judg|ment upon her for &s;ome Sin &s;he
<PB N="184" REF="101"> had privately committed; and had certainly run Mad, had &s;he not been &s;peedily re&s;tored to her Sight by wa&s;hing off the Glew, which was not &s;o ea&s;ily done neither.</P>
<P>This &s;tuck in the Maids Sto|mach, &s;o that one day being de&s;i|rous to ta&s;te of &s;ome Plum-Broth that was upon the Fire, <HI>Young La|zarillo</HI> de&s;ired the Maid to give him a Ta&s;te; whereupon the Maid taking up a Ladle-full, and hold|ing the Ladle in her own Hand, &s;he bid him &s;up: At what time <HI>Young Lazarillo</HI> opening his Mouth &s;omewhat wider than he needed, the unlucky Baggage pour'd the &s;calding Porridge down his Throat; &s;o that poor <HI>Lazarillo</HI> thought he had &s;wallowed the <HI>Gunpowder Plot.</HI> This put <HI>Lazarillo</HI> upon another De&s;ign: For, he ob&s;er|ving that the Maid in a &s;hort time after carry'd the Plum-Porridge Pot into the Yard, and &s;et it ju&s;t
<PB N="185" REF="101"> under the defending of the Jack-weight; <HI>Young Lazarillo,</HI> &s;o &s;oon as the Weight was down, took it off, and fa&s;tening the Porridge-Pot to the Pully, went into the Kitchin, and wound up the Ket|tle, Pottage and all, to the top of the Penthou&s;e, and then &s;topp'd the Jack, the Meat being taken from the Fire. By and by the Por|ridge was call'd for, but neither Porridge nor Pot were to be found, which put the whole Hou&s;e into an Uproar. And though the Maid &s;wore &s;he &s;aw it but ju&s;t before, and really thought that none but the Devil could have removed it, yet the Miracle could not be di&s;co|vered till the next Roa&s;ting; at what time the Porridge Pot de|&s;cended like an Angel in a Play-Hou&s;e, fa&s;tened to the Pully of the Jack-line.</P>
<P>Now, though the School-Ma&s;ter was an Old Man, yet he would
<PB N="186" REF="102"> not give over teaching for all that; &s;o that when he was indi&s;po&s;ed, he would &s;end for his Scholars in|to his Chamber, and teach them as he lay a-bed. One time among the re&s;t, a Gentleman had &s;ent the Ma&s;ter his Son's Quarteridge, for Diet and Teaching, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all in Gold. Which the Ma&s;ter recei|ving, call'd for a &s;mall Cabinet that &s;tood in the Room, which <HI>Young Lazarillo</HI> more officious than the re&s;t, pre&s;ently ran and fetch'd him; into which, when the Ma|&s;ter had lock'd up his choice Com|modity, he order'd <HI>Lazarillo</HI> to &s;et it where he found it. Pre&s;ent|ly the Devil became his Tutour, and now nothing would &s;erve his Turn but that he mu&s;t have that Gold. After many and various Stratagems and Contrivances, he bethought him&s;elf at length of ta|king the Impre&s;&s;ion of the Key in Wax, which with much difficulty
<PB N="187" REF="102"> he obtain'd, and carried to a Smith Four Miles off. But the Smith &s;u&s;pecting him, and que&s;tioning him what he intended to do with the Key, poor <HI>Lazarillo</HI> was forc'd to betake him&s;elf to his Heels, and run for it, not having any Excu&s;e or &s;pecious Pretence wherewith to couzen Old <HI>Vulcan,</HI> too well acquainted with &s;uch kind of De|vices. This Stratagem failing, he try'd a Pick-lock of his own In|vention; but that not taking Effect neither, he re&s;olv'd at length to take away Cabinet and all. To which purpo&s;e he watch'd his Opportu|nity, which he obtained in a &s;hort time. For, the Ma&s;ter had a Cu|&s;tom to keep within all the Day, and take his Recreations abroad in the Night. Thereupon <HI>Young Lazarillo</HI> watching his time, con|veighed him&s;elf into his Ma&s;ter's Chamber, and hid him&s;elf under the Bed; and when he found the
<PB N="188" REF="103"> Coa&s;t clear, getting the Cabinet into his Cu&s;tody, &s;tole out of the Hou&s;e and march'd all Night. In the Morning he found him&s;elf near a &s;mall Town about Sixteen Miles off from the School, where believing him&s;elf &s;ecure, he thought it requi&s;ite to re&s;t his ten|der weary Limbs, and &s;olace him|&s;elf with the &s;ight of his Purcha&s;e. To which purpo&s;e he enter'd the fir&s;t Inn he came to, and there call'd for &s;ome <HI>Mo&s;catella</HI> Wine, which he had heard much talk of, but never had ta&s;ted in his Life. At which the People of the Hou&s;e admiring that &s;uch a young Ur|chin as he, &s;hould call for &s;uch a &s;ort of dainty Liquor, viewed him very circum&s;pectly, but more e|&s;pecially the Cabinet under his Arm, which bred in them no &s;mall Jealou&s;ies of the Bearer; &s;o that they acquainted their Ma&s;ter with it; who being a kind of <HI>Corrigi|dor</HI>
<PB N="189" REF="103"> or Con&s;table, without craving Pardon for intruding, de&s;ired to be admitted into <HI>Young Lazarillo</HI>'s Society. Upon his admi&s;&s;ion, he began to Catechize <HI>Young Laza|rillo,</HI> asking him, Whence he came, Whither he was going, and, What he had in his Casket? But, before he could &s;tudy an an|&s;wer to the Que&s;tions which were put to him, he was overtaken by tho&s;e that clo&s;ely pur&s;ued him; &s;o that poor <HI>Young Lazarillo</HI> was laid hold on, and his Trea&s;ure taken from him.</P>
<P>Thus, ready to die, he was car|ried back to the place from whence he came; where, by the Ma&s;ter, he was confined clo&s;e Pri&s;oner within a Chamber, though not altogether without Company; for, he was daily vi&s;ited by the Ma&s;ter, who with a Cat-of-Nine-Tails flead his Buttocks twice a-Day; who, after he had Skinn'd
<PB N="190" REF="104"> his Po&s;teriors, would often wa&s;h them with Water and Salt. With|in a Week, his Mother being &s;ent for, arriv'd; who, hearing of the Rogueries of her hopeful Son, grew &s;o impatient, that &s;he would needs take him to Task her &s;elf; but, when &s;he had untru&s;s'd him, and &s;aw in what a woeful Plight he was (his Shirt being &s;tiffen'd like a piece of Buckram with Mat|ter and Blood, and his tender But|tocks all Plough'd and Harrow'd with the Cat-with-Nine-Tails) &s;he began to &s;cold at the Ma&s;ter; who, to pacifie her, told her, that great Offences required &s;evere Pu|ni&s;hments, and u&s;ed &s;o many Ar|guments, that his Mother at length was in part pacified; but, what to do with the Young Stripling &s;he knew not; and therefore &s;he con|&s;ulted with the Ma&s;ter, who told her, He dur&s;t not keep the young Vermin any longer; for that the
<PB N="191" REF="104"> Country People brought in daily mo&s;t grievous Complaints again&s;t him; and, to aggravate his Mo|ther the more, he gave her a Ca|talogue of his Crimes; As, how that once going to correct him for &s;ome unlucky Prank or other, having given him&s;elf a Laxative on purpo&s;e, he Squirted full in his Face upon the fir&s;t La&s;h; That, when he was upon the Boys Backs ready to be Whipp'd, he bit Holes in their Ears; That another time, having &s;urreverenc'd in a Paper, and running to the Window with it that look'd into the Yard, as his Old Mi&s;tre&s;s was gaping up to &s;ee who opened the Ca&s;ement, he let the Contents drop into her Mouth; That, in the Summer|time he watch'd the Lu&s;ty Young Girls, that were wont to Bath them&s;elves in a Brook not far from the School; and hiding him&s;elf under a Bu&s;h till they were &s;trip|ed,
<PB N="192" REF="105"> he would then go and take a|way their Cloths, and make them dance after him &s;tark naked, till he had &s;atisfied his waggi&s;h Humour; That he his Ma&s;ter ha|ving &s;ome choice Apricocks in his Garden, which were kept as chary as the forbidden Fruit for his pe|culiar Tooth, and looking out at his Window while <HI>Young Lazaril|lo</HI> was filling his Pockets, though not able to di&s;cern who it was, and therefore &s;ending for all the Boys together to make a privy &s;earch, her Son under&s;tanding the Bu&s;ine&s;s, cleverly conveigh'd the Fruit into the next Boy's Pocket; by which means, the poor Inno|cent Boy was &s;everely la&s;h'd, for the Crime which he him&s;elf had committed.</P>
<P><HI>Lazarillo</HI> hearing all this, and the &s;erious Con&s;ultation of his Mo|ther, how to di&s;po&s;e of him for the future (wherein &s;he propo&s;ed
<PB N="193" REF="105"> &s;everal Methods, no way plea&s;ing to <HI>Young Lazarillo</HI>) thereupon he re&s;olved to give her the &s;lip, and try his own Fortune in the World.</P>
<P>With this Re&s;olution away he trips, determining to &s;teer his Cour&s;e as Fortune &s;hould guide him. The fir&s;t Dinner he made, was upon the Fruits of the Field, and the Bu&s;hes, and when Night approached, he was forced to be|take him&s;elf to a Hay-Cock; but, con&s;idering with him&s;elf that he had no School-Exerci&s;e to make, nor was in any danger of over|&s;leeping him&s;elf the next Morn|ing, he endur'd his Hard&s;hip with the more Patience.</P>
<P>The next Day he rambled along (all tatter'd and torn with the Bu&s;hes and Briars, and with &s;crambling over the Hedges to get at the Green Pea&s;e as he went a|long) and, by that time 'twas Night, he got to an Inn that
<PB N="193" REF="106"> &s;tood alone upon the Road, where he begg'd Victuals and de&s;ired to lie in the Barn. The Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Hou&s;e call'd him in, and &s;eeing him a comely young Boy, ask'd him, Whence he came, and, Who were his Friends, and, Whither he was going? to all which the young arch Rogue an|&s;wer'd, That he was a poor Fa|therle&s;s and Motherle&s;s Child; That he had been put to School while they lived, and could both Read and Write; but, that his Pa|rents) to whom he gave wrong Names) being lately dead, he was put to his Shifts, and would be willing to &s;erve any Body, and do any thing for a living. The mode&s;t Look of the Boy, and the neatne&s;s of his Delivery, bred Compa&s;&s;ion in the Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Hou&s;e, &s;o that they re&s;olv'd to entertain him; e&s;pecially the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e,
<PB N="194" REF="106"> who, becau&s;e he could neither Write nor Read him&s;elf, was glad of &s;uch an A&s;&s;i&s;tant: For, to &s;ay Truth, <HI>Young Lazarillo</HI> was a very pretty Schollard of his Age.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, this Inn became his Habitation, where he was em|ployed to go of Errands, and up|on &s;everal other Occa&s;ions. But, he had not been long there, be|fore &s;uch a Contrivance came in|to this Young Boy's Noddle, that none but the Devil could have in|vented.</P>
<P>In this Inn there was a Cham|ber call'd the be&s;t Chamber, wherein were Lodg'd none but Per&s;ons of Quality that Travell'd that way. Into this Chamber was this Varlet of a Crack-rope wont to convey him&s;elf in the winter Nights, when any Gue&s;ts of Quality were to be Lodg'd there, and to keep him&s;elf clo&s;e conceal|ed till they were fa&s;t a&s;leep. Or,
<PB N="196" REF="107"> if he found them to be wakeful, betook him&s;elf to his Diabolical Stratagems, of &s;ighing and groan|ing like a <HI>troubled Gho&s;t;</HI> and &s;ometimes by the glimmering of the Coals in the Chimney, would open the Curtains, and &s;hew him|&s;elf in a white Shroud at the Beds &s;ide, till the poor affrighted Gen|tleman, in a dreadful Con&s;terna|tion, was forc'd to wrap him&s;elf in a cold Sweat over Head and Ears; and then was his time to pick their Pockets. Nor did the Gentlemen dare to complain of their Lo&s;&s;es, but were glad they were got out of the Hou&s;e; &s;o that at length the Report was &s;pread about the Country, that the Chamber was haunted. This Practice this young Devil of a <HI>La|zarillo</HI> continued for almo&s;t two whole Winters; till at la&s;t, a Gentleman that had been far|ther up in the Country, and be|ing
<PB N="197" REF="107"> belated in his return home (which was not above Ten Miles from the Inchanted Ca&s;tle) com|ing to the Inn, de&s;ired a Lodging. The Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Hou&s;e made him an&s;wer, That all the Rooms in the Hou&s;e were taken up, but only one Chamber that was haunted. <HI>Let it be haunted with a Legion</HI> (quoth the Gentle|man, who was a Per&s;on of Re&s;o|lution) <HI>if there be but a Mat, let me lie there, rather than in the Street.</HI> Only he de&s;ired a good Fire, two Great Candles, and a Book or two, to wa&s;te that time of the Night, wherein Goblings and Gho&s;ts are mo&s;t active. To be &s;hort, the Gentleman took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the haunted Cham|ber, had a good Supper and drank freely. All the forepart of the Night he &s;at and read; but &s;eeing no Devil appear, between two and three a-Clock in the Morn|ing
<PB N="198" REF="108"> he betook him&s;elf to his Re&s;t. But no &s;ooner had he compo&s;ed him&s;elf to &s;leep, than he felt &s;ome|thing creeping &s;oftly up at the Bed's Feet, and by and by &s;ome|what weighty upon his Shins. At which gathering up his Legs, he gave a &s;pring with both his Legs, which gave the young Devil &s;uch a &s;quelch, that he fell plump upon the Floor. Ay, thought he, the Devil's Airy Body can never make &s;uch a Noi&s;e. And with that, &s;tarting out of his Bed, he ran to the Chamber Door, and holding it fa&s;t lock'd in his Hand, knock'd and call'd as loud as he could to rai&s;e the Hou&s;e. In a &s;hort time, the Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;tre&s;s came, who, with two or three Servants and Lights, being let in, they fell to &s;earching the Cham|ber, not leaving the lea&s;t Hole or Cranny which they did not accurately peep into, yet could
<PB N="199" REF="108"> find nothing, which put the Gen|tleman into &s;ome kind of Amaze. But at la&s;t, remembring they had not look'd under the Table that &s;tood in the middle of the Room, cover'd with a large Carpet that trailed on every &s;ide upon the Ground, they turned up the Car|pet, and there they found the cun|ning Devil, <HI>Young Lazarillo;</HI> who being brought forth and ex|amined by the Gentleman, who was him&s;elf an <HI>Alguezite,</HI> or Ju|&s;tice of the Peace; upon his Exa|mination, confe&s;&s;ed the whole <HI>&s;e|ries</HI> of his Roguery, and was thereupon &s;ent to the next Grand Gaol, there to be puni&s;hed upon the &s;itting of the next <HI>Hermandad.</HI></P>
<P>The News of this Young De|vil being thus &s;pread all over the Country, <HI>Lazarillo</HI>'s Mother knew now where to find her lo&s;t Son. And, &s;uch was her motherly Af|fection, that with much ado, and
<PB N="200" REF="109"> the Expence of &s;ome Money, af|ter the Hangman had vi&s;ited his Shoulders with the Publick La&s;h, &s;he got him Home again.</P>
<P><HI>Young Lazarillo</HI> was by this time arrived at &s;ome years of Di&s;|cretion; and, his Mother belie|ving that his la&s;t Afflictions might have wrought in him &s;ome kind of Reformation, by the Advice of Friends &s;ent him to another School of a higher Order, where, to &s;ay Truth, he &s;trangely impro|v'd, to the great Content of his Parents and his Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>But now Lament and Weep with me; for here comes the di&s;|mal Cata&s;trophe, that nipp'd this Blo&s;&s;om in the Bud; and, for ought we know, deprived us of one of the plea&s;ante&s;t Lives that ever was Writ.</P>
<P>For, it happen'd, that the time for choo&s;ing of <HI>Kings</HI> being near, and the Ma&s;ter intending to give
<PB N="201" REF="109"> &s;ome Recreation to his Scholars, re&s;olv'd to make a <HI>Royalty.</HI> When the Time came, the Cake was divided; and, the Kingdom of the Bean, fell to <HI>Young Lazarillo</HI>'s &s;hare. With which he pre&s;ently acquaint|ed his Mother, that &s;he might pro|vide him Clothes and nece&s;&s;ary Ornaments. The Day of Tri|umph being come, he was moun|ted upon a <HI>Rozinant,</HI> like that of D. <HI>Quixot</HI>'s, a perfect Enchant|ed Hor&s;e, the leane&s;t that ever was &s;een; for, his Chine was at lea&s;t a Mile long; and, he was withal &s;o humble, that he went all the way making of Congies. He had but one Eye, a Neck like a Camel, and a Tail like an Ape, that is to &s;ay, no Tail at all. <HI>Young Lazarillo</HI> being mounted upon this &s;prightly Barb, and attended by all the re&s;t of his School-fellows, dre&s;t up in all the Finery their Mothers could procure for them,
<PB N="202" REF="110"> they all made their Proce&s;&s;ion through the Market-Place; but, coming near the Herb-woman's Stalls, <HI>Lazarillo</HI>'s Hunger &s;tarv'd Hor&s;e fell upon a Basket of Cole|worts, and devour'd them in a Trice, as being not a little over|joy'd at &s;o plea&s;ant a Bait. Upon which, the Herb-woman, who&s;e Coleworts they were, being a &s;ort of unruly Jade, and as Impu|dent as an Oi&s;ter Wench, began to &s;et up her Throat; at which, the whole Tribe came flocking a|bout her, with a great number of Rakehells and Porters, who &s;natch|ing up their great handfuls of Turneps and Onions, fell to pelt|ing of the poor King, who knew not what &s;hift to make; and, at the &s;ame time, one of the&s;e Cuck|oldly Rogues gave his Hor&s;e &s;o full a Charge upon the No&s;e, that being none of the &s;tronge&s;t, he fell backward with the King's
<PB N="203" REF="110"> Wor&s;hip, not upon dry Land, but (with Reverence be it &s;poken) into a Bottomle&s;s Jakes, where, before timely A&s;&s;i&s;tance could come to their Relief, the Hor&s;e and the Rider were &s;tifl'd; where we mu&s;t be forc'd to leave them, without &s;aying any thing of their Funerals; being in&s;tructed by the Proverb, which tells us, <HI>The more you &s;tir, the more 'twill &s;tink.</HI> Be|&s;ides, that it is all that we can find of the Acts and Deeds of <HI>Young Lazarillo,</HI> who&s;e Unfortunate End was bemoaned by all that knew him.</P>
