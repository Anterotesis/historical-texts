<P>THe Rain hath continued here, for four Weeks toge|ther, which hath &s;o &s;welled the <HI>Nei&s;ter,</HI> that notwith|&s;tanding all Endeavours, it hath ruined our Bridge, &s;o that only a part of our Army got over.</P>
<P>The Rains have &s;o far incommoded us, that we as well as our Hor&s;es &s;tand in Mud, and want forrage.</P>
<P>We al&s;o, are not freed from an Inva&s;ion of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> for they in a great Body having already pa&s;t the River, and laid the Country in ruin.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty is much di&s;plea&s;ed, being prevented in his de|&s;igns if he had got over the River: But he re&s;olves to put a good Garri&s;on in <HI>Suaint</HI> and <HI>Soochin,</HI> and then to march for <HI>Camminack,</HI> with hopes, that though he cannot be&s;iege that place, that yet he &s;hall find an opportunity in <HI>Moldavia</HI> to get over the River.</P>
<P>'Tis &s;aid the&s;e <HI>Tartars</HI> are 60000 &s;trong, under Command of the <HI>Cham</HI> and his Son.</P>
