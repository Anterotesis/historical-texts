That I&s;land (by rea&s;on wee could there finde no ground to anchor) we called the I&s;land without ground.

Our &s;hippe ma&s;ter rowed with the Shalop and our boate to &s;ound euery where, and found a fit place to lay the &s;hippe in, which was clo&s;e

The king &s;hewed our men great reuerence, and gaue them foure litle hogs, that day our men fetcht fiue fats full of water peaceably with out quarreling, for when any of the Indi|ans came neere our boate, the king him&s;elfe came the|ther and draue them thence, or &s;ent one of his men to doe it. His men were very obedient vnto him: for as it chanced that one of our coutela&s;&s;es was &s;tolen away from vs, and wee told one of the kings gentlemen thereof, hee gaue &s;ome of the Indians charge to fetch it againe, and pre&s;ently he that had taken it, was &s;ought for, and although hee was gone a good way of, they brought him backe who being come, the coutela&s;&s;e was layd downe at our feete, &amp; he was beaten with &s;taues, they making &s;ignes vnto vs with their fingers vpon their throates, that if the <HI>Herico</HI> (that is the king) knew of it, his head &s;hould be cut off, and after, that wee had no|thing &s;tolen from vs, neither on the &s;hoare, nor in the &s;hippe, nor el&s;e where: neither dur&s;t they take a fi&s;h that wee angled for. Tho&s;e people were very fearefull of our &s;hooting, for when we &s;hot off a mu&s;ket, they all ranne quaking and &s;hivering away, and wee put them in more feare, when wee &s;hewed them that vvee could &s;hoot with the great peeces, which the king de&s;ired vs once to doe, which being done they were all &s;o fearefull and aba&s;ht thereat, that all of them as al&s;o the king, (&s;itting vnder his Belay, or canopy, notwith&s;tanding all that we could &s;ay or doe to per&s;wade them,) &s;ore ama|&s;ed

<P>The crownes were made of long &s;mall white feathers and vnderneath and aboue mixt with &s;ome red, &amp; greene feathers, for they haue many Parrots, and &s;ome Doues, whereof they make great account, for euery one of the kings coun&s;ell had a doue by him &s;itting vpon a &s;ticke, tho&s;e Doues are white on their backes, and all the re&s;t blacke &s;auing their bre&s;ts which are reddi&s;h, all that day wee fetcht water, and bartered for good &s;tore of Cocos nuts, and Vbas rootes.</P>

<P>The nine and twentieth, in the morning, <HI>Iacoble Maire, Aris Claw&s;on,</HI> with <HI>Claus Iohn&s;on, Ban,</HI> and one of our Pi|lots went on &s;hore, and being there, went into the land, and climed vp vpon a hill, to &s;ee what fruite grew there|on, and to behold the cituation of the I&s;land, and being vpon the hill, the old king and his brother came thither to beare them company: there they &s;aw nothing but wil|dernes, and &s;ome valleys that were all bare, by rea&s;on of the great &s;tore of raine that had fallen, they al&s;o found &s;ome red colour, wherewith the women colour their heads and faces, and when they &s;aw that our men were weary with going, they made &s;ignes vnto them to goe downe to the &s;hippe againe, and ledde them by a good way, to a place where there was &s;ome Cocos trees, full of nuts, there they made our men &s;it downe, and the kings Lieuetenant putting a &s;tring about his feete, or

About noone our men came aboord againe, bringing with them the young King and his brother, that dined with vs, and while he &s;ate at the table, we told them that within two dayes we would goe from thence, where|at the young Kinge was &s;o glad, that for Ioy, hee pre|&s;ently leapt from the table, and going into the Galle|rie, cryed out, and &s;ayde, that within two dayes wee would be gon. They were in great feare of vs, (although we &s;hewed them all the friend&s;hip we could,) and doub|ted that we would take their Country from them. Hee promi&s;ed vs that if we would goe thence in 2. dayes, hee would giue vs 10. hogs, &amp; a great number of Cocos nuts, which they called <HI>Ali.</HI> When we had dined, the old king came aboord our &s;hip, who after their manner was a &s;tate|ly &s;eemely per&s;on, about 60. yeares of age, bringing with him 16. of his coun&s;ell: we receiued and welcomed him as well as we might. When hee entered into the &s;hip, he fell downe vpon his face, and prayed, then we ledde him into the hold, and there againe he prayed, he wondred much at that hee &s;aw, as wee al&s;o did at his behauiour: his men ki&s;t our feete, and tooke them in their handes, and laid them on their heads and their neckes, in &s;igne
<PB N="54" REF="32">of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. The King looked into all places of the &s;hippe, both before and behinde, and lookt as if he had beene in a dreame, but &s;pecially hee wondered at the great Ordinance, for 2. dayes before he had heard them &s;hot off, to honour him. When he had &s;eene the &s;hip in euery place he de&s;ired to goe on land againe, and vvent away with great reuerence made vnto vs. Our Marchant went with him, till he came to his <HI>Belay,</HI> where he ordi|narily &s;ate, and then went out to walke with the young king, and about euening came aboord againe. In the eue|ning with moone-&s;hine, <HI>Aris Claw&s;on</HI> went out to fi&s;h, and hauing taken a great &s;hole of fi&s;h, went to the king, there he founde a number of young wenches dauncing before him, one played on a hollow piece of wood like a pump, which made a noy&s;e, whereat the young wenches daun|ced after their maner, very finely, and with a good grace, according to the mea&s;ure of the noy&s;e of the In&s;trument. Our people wondred to &s;ee tho&s;e wilde people daunce in that &s;ort, and in the night they came on boord againe.</P>
<P>The 30.

When the Kinge was neere vnto the other King, hee beganne a farre off with &s;trange ceremonies and reuerence to bow downe his bo|dy, falling with his face vpon the ground, &amp; praying with a great noi&s;e, and much zeale, as we thought. The other king went to meete him, and likewi&s;e with a great noy&s;e and &s;trange ge&s;tures, v&s;ed him very reuerently, and after much adoe, they both ro&s;e vp on their feete, and went and &s;ate together vnder the kings <HI>Belay,</HI> and there were

They al&s;o brought a great number of Vbas rootes, which they had ro&s;ted, and &s;ixteene hogs that were onely ript, and the guts ta|ken out, but all bloudy, and not wa&s;ht, and hauing cer|taine hote &s;tones put into their bellyes, and outwardly their haire &s;inged off by the fire, were wel ro&s;ted after their maner, and they eate them as &s;auourely and with as good an appetite, as wee could doe when they are well &s;odden or ro&s;ted after our manner. Tho&s;e people yeeld great reuerence and re&s;pect vnto their Kinges, for all the meate vvhich they brought before their King, (who in their language they call <HI>Herico</HI>) they laid it vpon their

<P>The 31. in the morning, the kings of both I&s;lands came aboord our &s;hip, with their troupes of gentelmen, after their manner. The chiefe of them hadde greene Cocos leaues about their neckes, in &s;igne of peace. We receiued them (as they had done to vs) with great reue|rence, and led them into the Cabbin, and into euery place of the &s;hippe, and when they hadde &s;eene all, they gaue vs &s;ix hogs. Both the kings them&s;elues layd them fir&s;t one after the other vpon their heads, and then downe before our feet, with great humilitie, bowing their heads downe to the ground, meane time while wee tooke a|way the hogs, we led them into the cabbin againe, where wee gaue them two bundels of beades, and each king two kniues and &s;ix nayles, and there with they friendly tooke their leaue of vs, and went on land. <HI>Iacoble Maire</HI> our Marchant beare them company to the &s;hore, to whom they gaue three hogs more. Which hee brought aboord the &s;hippe, and then wee prepared our &s;elues to &s;et &s;ayle, to the great contentment of the Indians of that I&s;land, becau&s;e as long as wee were there, they alwayes feared we would kil them, and take their country from them. Tho&s;e people were men of good vnder&s;tanding, and of great &s;ta|ture, for the lea&s;t man of them was as big as the talle&s;t
<PB N="57" REF="34">of vs, and the talle&s;t of them was farre higher then any of vs, they were &s;trong men, and well proportioned of bo|dy and limbs, they went very fa&s;t, and &s;wam and diued vn|der the water excellent well, their colour was altogether browne yealow, they were very curious in the dre&s;&s;ing and trimming of their haire, &s;ome hadde it curled, &s;ome frizled, &s;ome ware it bound vp in long foldes 4.5. or 6. together, as our women doe in haire-laces, and &s;ome (which was &s;trange to &s;ee) had their haire &s;tanding vp|right vpon their heads, about a quarter of an elle long like hogs bri&s;tles.

We could not per|ceiue that they wor&s;hipped God, or any Gods, or v&s;ed any deuotion, neither the one nor the other, but li|ued without care, like birdes in the wood. They had no &s;kill of buying or &s;elling, but with flaggs they deliuered vs &s;ome what, and vvee in like &s;ort to them againe. They neither &s;owe nor reape, nor doe any worke, There the earth of it &s;elfe yeeldes all that they neede to &s;u&s;taine their liues: as Cocos, Vbas, Bananas, and &s;uch like fruit.

The Shalop came on boord againe, without finding any ground, telling vs that the peoples language was cleane contrary to the former, we &s;ayled a|long by the coa&s;t, which was very high and greene, plea|&s;ant to behold, there we &s;aw much land as it had bin hou|&s;es, at euening we got about the point into a bay, there we anchored at 45. fathom, vnfit and vneuen ground. The &s;ame euening there came 2.

The hurt men were cured, but one of them dyed, about noone our men row|ed with the 2. wounded men to the land, along the &s;hore, there the pri&s;oners cryed to their fellowes to bring vs hogs, Bananas and Cocos nuts, wherewith one Canoe came aboord, that brought a little hog, and a bunch of

<P>The 28. there came certaine Canoes aboord our &s;hip, but brought nothing with them, neither would they ran&s;om their man, therefore we let him goe on &s;hore a|gaine.

<P>The 29. the wind was variable, and our cour&s;e was northwe&s;t, and northwe&s;t and by north, with faire wea|ther till noone, then it calmd.

<P>The 10. there came at lea&s;t 20. Canoes, on boord of our &s;hip, with men, women, and children in them, all na|ked, only their priuie members couered, but brought no great matter with them.</P>
<P>The 11. in the morning vve put to &s;ea againe, and held our cour&s;e north vve&s;t, and by we&s;t, and we&s;t north we&s;t along the coa&s;t, with the land alwayes in &s;ight 3.2. and a league and a halfe di&s;tant from it, and at noone pa&s;t by a high point.

<P>The 15.

We made towards them, and there found good anchor ground, at 40.30.25. and 20. to 6. and 5. fathom deepe, and there anchored at 13. fathom good ground.

<P>The 17. in the morning, there came 2 or 3 Canoes towards our &s;hip, and threw Cocos nuttes into the water making &s;ignes to vs to fetch them, whereby they &s;ought to be friends with vs, Wee made &s;ignes to them to come aboord, at la&s;t taking better courage, they came clo&s;e to the &s;hippe, and brought vs as many Cocos nuttes and

<P>The 31 we perceiued that we were entred into a place where we had the land round about vs, therefore we held our cour&s;e north, and that euening pa&s;t the Equinoctiall line the &s;econd time, and being clo&s;ed by the land, an|chored at 12. fathom good ground, about a Cannon &s;hot from an I&s;land, that lay clo&s;e by the firme land, but there wee &s;aw no men nor any thing growing.</P>
