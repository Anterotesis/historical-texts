<HEAD>SECTION. I.</HEAD>
<P>_AMongst those
many advan|tages,
which
conduce to en|rich
the mind
with Knowledge, to rectify
the Iudgement, and com|pose
outward manners;
<PB N="2" REF="6">
Forraine Travell is none of
the least.</P>
<P>But to bee a Sedentary
Traveller only, penn'd up be|tween
Wals, and to stand
poring all day upon a Map,
upon imaginary Circles and
Scales, is like him, who
thought to come to bee a
good Fencer, by looking on
Agrippa's book-postures on|ly:
As also to run over and
traverse the world by Heare|say,
and traditionall relation,
with other mens eyes, and
so take all things upon cour|tesie,
is but a confused and
imperfect kind of speculati|on,
which leaveth but weake
and distrustfull notions be|hind
it; in regard the Eare
is not so authen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters">q<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">e a wit|nesse
<PB N="3" REF="6">
as the Eye; because the
Eye, by which as through a
cleare christall Casement,
wee discerne the various
works of Art and Nature,
and in one instant compre|hend
halfe the whole Vni|verse
in so small a roome af|ter
so admirable a manner, I
say the Eye having a more
quick and immediat com|merce
and familiarity with
the Soule (being the princi|pall
of her Cinq ports, and
her Centinell) taketh in farre
deeper Ideas, and so makes
firmer and more lasting im|pressions,
conveying the ob|ject
more faithfully to the
memory, where it remaines
afterward upon record in
particular topicall notes, and
<PB N="4" REF="7">
indelible characters: For
though I confesse with the
Stagirite, that Hearing is the
sense of Learning (and of
Faith also, as the holy Text
tels me) yet the Sight surpas|seth
it by many degrees, if
you respect the curious
workeman-ship of the Or|gan,
the readiest roade to the
heart, and love's best Intelli|gencer
and Usher: As also
for the penetrative apprehen|sion
of the object, with the
intuitive vertue and force of
affection, it worketh inward|ly,
as we find upon good re|cord
that a heard of Sheepe
conceived once by the
strength of the Eye, as like|wise
for the wonderfull
quicknesse of this Sense,
<PB N="5" REF="7">
which is such that i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> makes
the effect oftentimes fore-run
the cause, as we see the Light|ning,
before wee Heare the
Thunder, though thunder
be first in Nature, being by
the violent eruption it makes
out of the Cloud, the cause
of such fulgurations. And
although one should reade
all the Topographers that e|ver
writ of, or anatomiz'd a
Town or Countrey, and
mingle Discourse with the
most exact observers of the
Government thereof, and
labour to draw and draine
out of them all they possibly
know or can remember&punc;
Yet one's own Ocular view,
and personall conversation
will still find out something
<PB N="6" REF="8">
new and unpointed at by any
other, either in the cariage
or the Genius of the people,
or in the Policy and munici|pall
customes of the Coun|trey,
or in the quality of the
Clime and Soyle, and so en|able
him to discourse more
knovvingly and confidently
and vvith a kind of Authori|ty
thereof; It being an Act
of parlament in force a|mongst
all Nations: That
one Eye-witnesse is of more va|lidity
than ten Aur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">cular.</P>
<P>Moreover as every one is
said to abound with his owne
sense, and that among the
race of man-kind, Opinions
and Francies, are found to be
as various as the severall
Faces and Voyces; So in each
<PB N="7" REF="8">
individuall man there is a
differing facultie of Obser|vation,
of Iudgement, of Ap|plication,
vvhich makes that
every one is best satisfied,
and most faithfully instru|cted
by himselfe, I do not
meane soley by himselfe,
(for so he may have a foole to
his Master) but Books also,
and conversation vvith the
Dead must concurre, for
they are likevvise good
Teachers, and edifie infi|nitely;
yet the study of li|ving
men, and a collation of
his ovvn Optique observati|ons
and judgement vvith
theirs, vvork much more
strongly, and where these
meet (I meane the living
and the dead) they perfect.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="9">
And indeed this is the
prime use of Peregrination,
which therefore may be not
improperly called a moving
Academy, or the true Peri|patetique
Schoole: This
made Ulisses to be cryed up
so much amongst the
Gre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ks for their greatest
wise man, because he had
Travelled through many
strange Countreys, and ob|served
the manners of divers
Nations, having seene, as it
was said and sung of him,
more Cities than there were
Houses in Athens, which
was much in that age of the
World: and the Greatest of
their Emperours did use to
glory in nothing so often,
as that he had surveyed more
<PB N="9" REF="9">
Land with his Eye, than other
Kings could comprehend with
their thoughts.</P>
<P>Amongst other people of
the Earth, Islanders seeme to
stand in most need of For|raine
Travell, for they being
cut off (as it were) from the
rest of the Citizens of the
World, have not those ob|vious
accesses, &amp; contiguity
of situation, and other ad|vantages
of society, to
mingle with those more re|fined
Nations, whom Learn|ing
and Knowledge did first
Vrbanize and polish. And
as all other things by a kind
of secret instinct of Nature
follow the motion of the
Sun, so is it observed that
the Arts and Sciences which
<PB N="10" REF="10">
are the greatest helps to Ci|vility,
and all Morall endow|ments
as well as Intellectuall,
have wheel'd about and tra|vell'd
in a kind of concomi|tant
motion with that great
Luminary of Heaven: They
budded first amongst the
Brachma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">s and Gymnosophists
in India, then they blossom'd
amongst the Chaldeans and
Priests of Egypt whence they
came down the Nile, and
crossed over to Greece, and
there they may bee said to
have borne ripe fruit, having
taken such firme rooting,
and making so long a Plan|tation
in Athens and else
where: Afterwards they
found the way to Italy, and
thence they clammer'd over
<PB N="11" REF="10">
the Alpian hils to visit Ger|many
and France, whence
the Britaines with other
North-west Nations of the
lower World fetch'd them
over; and it is not impro|bable
that the next Flight
they will make, will bee to
the Savages of the new di|scovered
World&punc; and so
turne round, and by this
circular perambulation visit
the L<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">vantines again.</P>
<P>Hence we see what a Tra|veller<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">
Learning hath beene
having in conformitie of
cours, been a kind of com|panion
to Ap<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">llo himselfe:
And as the Heavenly bodies
are said to delight in move|ment
and perpetuall circum|gyration,
wherein as Pytha|goras,
<PB N="12" REF="11">
goras, who by the Delphian
Oracle was pronounced, the
wisest man that ever Greece
bredd, did hold, there was a
kind of Musique and Har|monious
concent that issued
out of this regular motion,
which we cannot perceive,
because being borne in it, it
is connaturall to us, so it
is observed to be the Genius
of all active and generous
Spirits,
<Q>Qu&ecirc;is meliore luto finxit prae|cordia
Titan,</Q></P>
<P>To have been always trans|ported
with a desire of Tra|vell,
and not to be bounded,
or confined within the
shoares and narrow circum|ference
<PB N="13" REF="11">
of an Island, without
ever-treading any peece of
the Continent; whereas on
the other side, meane and
vulgar spirits, whose Soules
sore no higher than their
Sense, love to hover ever
about home, lying still as
it were at dead anchor, mo|ving
no further than the
length of the cable, where|unto
they are tyed, not da|ring
to lance out into the
maine, to see the wonders
of the deep: Such a one
was hee of whom Claudian
speakes, to have had his
birth, breeding, and buriall
in one Parish; such slow
and sluggish spirits may be
said to bee like Snailes or
Tortuises in their shels,
<PB N="14" REF="12">
crawling always about their
own home, or like the Cy|nique,
shut up alwayes in a
Tub.</P>
<P>Amongst other Nations
of the World the English are
observed to have gained
much, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">mproved them|selfes
infinitely by voyaging
both by Land and Sea, and
of those foure Worthies who
compassed about the Terre|striall
Globe, I find the ma|jor
part of them were En|glish,
but the scope of this
Discours is to prescribe
precepts for Land Travell
only (for the other requires
another Tract apart) and
first,

<HEAD>SECT. II.</HEAD>
<P>IT is very requisit that hee
who exposeth himselfe
to the hazard of Forraine
Travell, should bee well
grounded and settled in his
Religion, the beginning and
basis of all Wisdome, and
somwhat versed in the Con|troversies
'twixt us and the
Church of Rome, which I
<PB N="16" REF="13">
presume he hath done in the
University, where (I take it
for granted, hee hath been
matriculated, and besides
his initiation in the Arts and
Sciences, and learn't to chop
Logick (&amp; Logick though she
be no Science of her self, but as
she is subservient to another,
Like the Shoomakers Last,
that may bee applyable to any
foot, yet no Science can bee
rightly studied without her
method, nor indeed can
the termes of Art be well un|derstood,
or any Scholler|like
discours fram'd but by
her) where I say, besides
these studies, he hath sucked
the pure milke of true Reli|gion,
and Orthodoxall truth,
and such a one will be rather
<PB N="17" REF="13">
confirmed, than shaken in
the tenets of his Faith, when
he seeth the sundry fond
fantastique formes, which
have crept into the solemne
service of God, since the pri|mitive
times, for the practise
of the Roman Church is
worse than her positions, so
that I have knowne some,
who were wrought upon ve|ry
far by the one, averted a|gain
by the other, I meane
by her Ceremonies, which
in some places are so mimi|call,
and set forth in such an|tique
postures, that it may
be not improperly sayd,
whereas Religion should go
array'd in a grave Matron-like
habit, they have clad
her rather like a wanton
<PB N="18" REF="14">
Courtisane in light dresses:
Such a one, I meane he that
is well instructed in his own
Religion, may passe under
the torrid Zone, and not bee
Sun-burnt, if he carry this
bon-grace about him, or
like the River Danube which
scornes to mingle with the
muddy streame of Sava,
though they run both in one
Channell, or like Arethusa,
which Travelleth many
hundred miles through the
very bowels of the Sea, yet
at her journeys end issueth
out fresh againe, without the
least mixture of saltnesse or
brackishnesse: So such a one
may passe and repasse
through the very midst of
the Roman See, and shoot
<PB N="19" REF="14">
the most dangerous Gulphe
thereof, and yet returne
home an untainted Prote|stant;
nay he will be con|firmed
in zeale to his owne
Religion, and illuminated the
more with the brightnesse of
the truth thereof, by the
glaring lights and specious
glosses, which the other u|seth
to cast; For Opposita ju|xta
se posita magis elucescunt:
Nay the more he is encom|passed
with the superstitions,
of the contrary, the more he
will bee strengthned in his
own Faith; like a good
Well useth to be hotter in
Winter than Summer, per
Antiperistasin, that is, by the
coldnesse of the circumam|bient
ayre, which in a man|ner
<PB N="20" REF="15">
besiegeth it round, and
so makes the intrinsique
heate, unite and concentre
it selfe the more strongly
to resist the invading E|nemy.</P>
<P>After Religion, it is fitting
he should be well versed in
the Topography, Govern|ment
and History of his own
Country, for some are found
Foris sapere, and domi caecu|tire,
to be Eagles abroad, and
stark Buzzards at home, be|ing
not able to satisfie a
stranger by exchange of dis|cours,
in any thing touch|ing
the State of their owne
Countrey.</P>
<P>To this end it were not
amisse to run over Cambden,
Sir Iohn Smiths Common|wealth,
<PB N="21" REF="15">
with those short
pieces of Story, as Daniel and
others who have written
of the English Kings since the
Conquest, and extract out
of them, what traverses of
war, what other passages
and entercourses of State
have happened 'twixt us and
other Nations since the last
Conquest, specially the
French our nearest neigh|bors:
It is also very behoof|full,
that he have a passable
understanding of the Latine
tongue, whereof the Italian,
the Spanish, and French, are
but as it were branches of
the same Tree; they are but
Dialects or Daughters, and
having gain'd the good will
of the Mother, hee will
<PB N="22" REF="16">
quickly prevayle with the
Daughters.</P>
<P>That hee understand the
use of the Map and Globe,
to find out the Longitude
and Latitude of all places,
and to observe and compare
the temper of them as hee
shall passe along.</P>
<P>Lastly that hee seriously
contemplate within himself,
how the eyes of all the
World are upon Him, as his
are upon the World, what
his parents, kindred and ac|quaintance,
yea his Prince
will expect at his returne:
That he is now in the very
forge of his hopes, either
upon making or marring:
That (being of Noble extra|ction)
he is like to be a Star
<PB N="23" REF="16">
of the greatest Magnitude in
the Spheare of his owne
Countrey, therefore com|mon
qualities will not serve
his turne, that the higher the
building is, the more it re|quires
exquisit forme and
symmetry, that Nobility
without inward ornaments
is as faire guilded shels with|out
kernels, or like a sattin
doublet with canvas li|nings,
whereas on the O|ther
side Vertue reflecting
upon a Noble subject, is as
the Sun-beames falling upon
a rock of Cristall, which
makes the reverberation
stronger and far more re|splendent,
or as rich gold|embrodery,
upon a piece
of Tissue: Such thoughts
<PB N="24" REF="17">
as these will worke much
upon an ingenious Spirit,
and bee as a golden Spur,
to set him forward, and
cheere him in this high
roade of Vertue, and Know|ledge.</P>

<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<PB N="25" REF="17">
<HEAD>SECT. III.</HEAD>
<P>THe first Countrey that
is most requisite for the
English to know, is France,
in regard of neighboured, of
conformity in Government
in divers things and necessa|ry
intelligence of State, and
of the use one shall have of
that Language wheresoever
he passe further: And the
younger one goeth to France
the better, because of the
hardnesse of the accent and
pronunciation, which will
be hardly overcome by one
<PB N="26" REF="18">
who hath passed his minori|ty,
and in this point the
French Tongue may bee said
to be like Fortune, who, be|ing
a woman, loves youth
best. Whereas for other
Tongues, one may attaine to
speake them to very good
purpose, and get their good
will at any age; the French
Tongue by reason of the huge
difference 'twixt their wri|ting
and speaking, will put
one often into fits of de|spaire
and passion, as wee
read of one of the Fathers,
who threw away Persius a|gainst
the wals, saying, si non
vis intelligi debes negligi, but
the Learner must not bee
daunted awhit at that, but
after a little intermission hee
<PB N="27" REF="18">
must come on more strong|ly,
and with a pertinacity of
resolution set upon her again
and againe, and woe her as
one would do a coy Mistres,
with a kind of importunity,
untill he over-master her.</P>
<P>Indeed some of riper
plants are observed to over|act
themselves herein, for
while they labour to trencher
le mot, to cut the word, as they
say, and speake like naturall
French-men, and to get the
true genuine tone (and every
tongue hath a tone or tune
peculiar to her self, specially
the French, which hath a
whining kind of querulous
tone specially amongst the
peasantry, which I beleeve
proceeded from that pitti|full
<PB N="28" REF="19">
slavery they are brought
unto) I say while they la|bour
for this, they fall a lis|ping
and mincing, and to di|stort
and strain their mouths
and voyce, so that they ren|der
themselves fantastique
and ridiculous; let it bee
sufficient for one of riper
yeares, to speake French in|telligibly
roundly, and con|gruously
without such forc'd
affectation.</P>
<P>The French tongue like
the Nation, is a bold and
hardy speach, therefore the
learner must not be bashfull
or meale mouth'd in speak|ing
any thing, whatsoever it
is, let it come forth confi|dently
whither true or false
Sintaxis; for a bold vivaci|ous
<PB N="29" REF="19">
spirit hath a very great
advantage in attaining the
French, or indeed any other
Language: He must be cau|telous
not to force any An|glicismes
upon the French
Tongue, that is certaine vul|gar
Phrases, Proverbs, and
Complements, which are
peculiar to the English, and
not vendible or used in
French, as I heard of one
that could not forbeare a
great while to salute his
Land-Lord by bon matin:
Another would be alwayes
complaining at play of his
mauvaise Fortune: Another
when at the racket court he
had a ball struck into his ha|zard,
hee would ever and
anon cry out, estes wous l&agrave; a|vec
<PB N="30" REF="20">
vos Ours, Are you there
with your Beares? which is
ridiculous in any other lan|guage
but English, for every
speech hath certaine Idiomes,
and customary Phrases of its
own, and the French, of all
other, hath a kind of contu|macy
of phrase, in respect of
our manner of speaking, pro|per
to it selfe.</P>
<P>He must alwayes have a
Diary about him, when he is
in motion of Iourneys, to set
down what his Eyes meetes,
with most remarquable in
the day time, out of which
he may raise matter of dis|cours
at night, and let him
take it for a rule, that
Hee offend lesse who writes
many toyes, than he, who omits
<PB N="31" REF="20">
one serious thing. For the
Penne maketh the deepest fur|rowes,
and doth fertilize, and
enrich the memory more than
any thing else,
<Q>Littera scripta manet, sed
manant lubrica verba.</Q></P>
<P>It were very requisit to
have a book of the Topogra|phicall
description of all
places, through which hee
passeth; and I think Bertius,
or the Epitome of Ortelius,
which are small and por|table,
would bee the best.
At his first comming to any
Citie he should repaire to
the chief Church (if not I|dolatrous)
to offer up his sa|crifice
of thanks, that hee is
<PB N="32" REF="21">
safely arrived thither, and
then some have used to get
on the top of the highest
Steeple, where one may
view with advantage, all the
Countrey circumjacent, and
the site of the City, with the
advenues and approaches a|bout
it; and so take a Lands|kip
of it.</P>
<P>Being come to France, his
best cours will be to retire to
some Vniversity abou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> the
Loire, unfrequented by the
English, for the greatest bane
of English Gentlemen a|broad,
is too much frequen|cy
and communication with
their own Countrey-men,
and there let him apply him|selfe
seriously to gaine the
practicall knowledge of the
<PB N="33" REF="21">
Language, and for the time
hoc agere. This hee may do
with more advantage, if hee
repaires sometimes to the
Courts of Pleading, and to
the Publique Schooles; For in
France they presently fall
from the Latine, to dispute
in the vulgar tongue: So
that it were not amisse for
him to spend some time in
the New Academy; erected
lastly by the French Cardi|nall
in Richelieu, where all
the Sciences are read in the
French tongue, which is
done of purpose to refine,
and enrich the Language.</P>
<P>Some have used it as a
prime help to advance Lan|guage,
to have some ancient
Nunne for a Divota, with
<PB N="34" REF="22">
whom hee may chat at the
grates, when hee hath little
else to do, for the Nunnes
speake a quaint Dialect, and
besides they have most com|monly
all the Newes that
passe, and they will enter|taine
discours till one bee
weary, if hee bestow on
them now and then some
small bagatels, as English
Gloves or Knifs, or Ribands;
and before hee go over, hee
must furnish himselfe with
such small curiosities; but
this I dare not advise him to,
in regard the Hazard one
way may bee greater, than
the Advantage the other way.</P>
<P>In this retirement he must
assigne some peculiar dayes
to read the History of the
<PB N="35" REF="22">
Countrey exactly, which is
a most usefull and delight|full
study: For in History,
that great Treasury of Time,
and promptuary of Heroique a|ctions,
there are words to
speake, and works to imitat,
with rich and copious mat|ter
to raise Discours upon:
History, next to Eternity only
triumphs over Time, she, only
after God Almighty can do mi|racles,
for shee can bring back
Age past, and give life to the
Dead, to whom she serves as
a sacred shrine to keep their
names immortall.</P>
<P>Touching Books he must
choose them, as hee should
do his Friends, Few, but
Choyce ones, yet he may have
many Acquaintance: And
<PB N="36" REF="23">
as for morall society, the
greatest Wisdome of a man
is discerned in a judicious
election of his friends,
which are as Commenta|ries
upon one's selfe, and are
more necessary than fire and
water, as the Philosophher
said: So for speculative and
private conversation with
Authors our dead Associates,
there must bee must judge|ment
used in the choice of
them, specially when there
is such a confusion of them,
as in France, which as Africk
peoduceth always somthing
New, for I never knew
week passe in Paris, but it
brought forth some new
kinds of Authors; but let
him take heed of Tumultuary,
<PB N="37" REF="23">
and disjointed Authors, as
well as of frivolous, and pe|dantique.</P>
<P>And touching Bookes, as a
a noble speculative Lord of
this Land said, some are to
be tasted, only, some chewed,
and some swallowed: Here|unto
I will adde that some
are to be dissected and anato|mized
into Epitomes and
Notes.</P>
<P>To this purpose for the
generall History of France,
Serres is one of the best, and
for the moderne times d' Au|bigni,
Pierre Mathieu, and
du Pleix; for the politicall
and martiall government,
du Haillan, de la No&uuml;e, Bodin,
and the Cabinet; Touching
Commines, who was con|temporary
<PB N="38" REF="24">
with Machiavil,
'twas a witty speach of the
last Queen mother of France,
that he made more Heretiques
in Policy, than Luther ever did
in Religion: Therefore he re|quires
a reader of riperyears.</P>
<P>The most difficult taske
in gaining a forrain language
is to turne English into it, for
to translate another Tongue
into English, is not halfe so
hard nor profitable. In
reading hee must couch in a
faire Alphabetique paper|book
the notablest occur|rences,
such alliances, and
encounters of warre (speci|all
in the last Race of the
Kings) that have intervened
'twixt England and France,
and set them by themselves
<PB N="39" REF="24">
in Sections. When he meets
with any great businesse, hee
must observe therein the
preceding Counsels, the action
it selfe the motives of it, and the
mould wherein it was cast, the
progresse &amp; even of it, which if
successeful, he must note by
what kind of Instruments, co~|federations
&amp; cours of poli|cy
it was carried, if not, where
the difficulties and defects
lay. The manner &amp; method
in reading of Annalists is in|finitly
advantagious, if one
take his rise hansomely from
the beginning, and follow
the series of the matter, the
Epoch of the times, and re|gular
succession and contem|porarinesse
of Princes; o|therwise
if one read skip|pingly
<PB N="40" REF="25">
and by snatches, and
not take the threed of the sto|ry
along, it must needs puz|zle
and distract the memory,
wherein his observations will
lye confusedly h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ddled up, like
a skeine of intangle silk.</P>
<P>For Sundayes and Holy|dayes,
there bee many Trea|<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ises
of Devotion in the
French tongue, full of pathe|ticall
ejaculations and Hea|venly
raptures, and his Clo|set
must not be without some
of these. For he must make
account before hand that his
Closet must bee his Church,
and chiefest Chappel abroad.
Therefore it were necessary
when he fixeth in any place,
to have alwayes one in his
chamber, whether to retire
<PB N="41" REF="25">
early and late, to his solilo|quies
and meditations, the

must open and shut the day, and

<P>Peter du Moulin hath many
fine pieces to this purpose,
du Plessis, Allencour, and o|thers;

them. His Closet also must
be his Rendez-vous, when|soever
hee is surprized with
any fit of pensivenesse (as

Kinred will often affect one) 
For no earthly thing exhile|rats

a convalessence at best, which

from the Lord to the Laquay,
from the Peasant to the Prince,

the Ermine is no ill Embleme,

in this life, we cannot pre|vent
but myriads of melancho|ly
cogitations, and thoughtfull
cares and longings will often
seaze upon our imaginations,
yet we may hinder these thoughts
to build their nests within our

<P>HAving by the retirement
aforesaid attained to a

then adventure upon Paris,
and the Court, and visit Am|bassadors,
and going in the
equipage of a young Noble|man,
hee may entertaine a
Cook, a Laquay, and some
young youth for his Page,
to parley and chide withall,
(whereof he shall have oca|sion
enough) and to get some
<PB N="49" REF="29">
faire lodgings to keep house
of himself, and sometimes he
may frequent Ordinaries,
for it will much breake and
enbolden him: As for ex|pences,
he must make ac|compt
that every servant he
hath (whereof there should
be none English but his Go|vernour)
every one will stand
him in 50 pounds a piece per
annum; And for his owne
expences, he cannot allow
himselfe lesse than 300 l. I
include herein all sorts of
exercises, his Riding, Dancing,
Fencing, the Racket, Coach|hire,
with other casuall
charges, together with his
Apparell, which if it bee fa|shionable,
it matters not how
plaine it is, it being a ridicu|lous

vanity to go gaudy a|mongst

<P>The time that he spends
in Paris, must be chiefly em|ployed
to improve himselfe
in the exercises afore-said,
for there the choycest Ma|sters
are of any part of Chri|stendome.
Hee must apply
himselfe also to know the fa|shion
and garb of the Court,
observe the Person and Ge|nius
of the Prince, enquire
of the greatest Noble-men,
and their Pedigree (which I
recommend to his speciall
consideration) of the Favo|rits
and Prime Counsellors
of State, the most eminent
Courtiers, and if there bee
<PB N="51" REF="30">
any famous man, to seek con|versation

was the saying of a great

go fifty miles to heare a wise

<P>For private Gentlemen

where for 150

may be very well accommo|dated,
with lodging and diet
for himselfe and a man, and
be taught to Ride, to Fence,
to manage Armes, to Dance,

<P>There are in Paris every

(yet London hath exceeded

the Gazets and Courants hee
should do well to reade
weekly, and raise Discours
thereon, for though there be
many triviall passages in

<P>One thing I must reco|mend
to his speciall care,
that he be very punctuall in
writing to his Friends once a

must do exactly, and not in a

For Letters are the Ideas and

truest Miror of the Mind;
they shew the inside of a

let it appeare that he
doth not only Remember,
but meditate on his Friend;
not to scribble a few cur|sory
lines, but to write e|laborately
and methodi|cally,

the fittest Countrey
for him to see next is Spaine,
and in his Iourney thither
he shall traverse the whole

and passing through Gascoi|gne

their fashion, for as a Spani|ard
lookes like a bug-beare

any more money than is ab|solutly

his expences, for some in
this particular have beene
Peny-wise, and Pound-foolish,
who in hopes of some small

(as it were) unto them danger
for their Companion, and feare
for their bed-fellow.</P>
<P>For although Sir Thomas
More wisheth one to carry
always his Friends about
him, abroad, by which hee
meanes pieces of gold: Yet
too great a number of such
Friends, is an encomber and
may betray him: It will
make his Iourney all along
to be a Motus trepidationis.
And he that loades himselfe
with a charge of money,
when he may carry it about
him with such security, and
ease, in a small piece of pa|per,
I meane a Letter of cre|dit,

as wise as he, who carried the

<P>In Spaine hee must bee
much more carefull of his
diet, abstemious from fruit,
more reserved and cautelous
in his Discours, but enter|taine
none at all touching
Religion, unlesse it be with
Silence; a punctuall repaire
of visits, extraordinary
humble in his comportment;
for the Spaniards, of all o|ther,
love to be respected at
their own homes, and can|not
abide an <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">nsolent cariage
in a Stranger; On the other
side, Courtesie and Morige|ration,
will gaine mightily
upon them, and courtesie is
the chiefest congnisance of a
Gentleman, which joyned with
<PB N="60" REF="35">
discretion, can only Travaile
all the World over without a
Passeport, and of all sorts of
Friends, he is the cheapest
who is got by Courtesie, and
Complement only: Moreover
a respectfull and humble ca|riage,
is a mighty advantage
to gaine Intelligence and
Knowledge; It is the Key
that opens the breash, and un|locks
the heart of any one:
He that looked downeward,
saw the Stars in the water,
but he who looked only upward
could not see the water in
the Stars: therefore there
is much more to bee got
by Humility than other|wise.</P>
<P>One thing I would dis|swade
him from, which is
<PB N="61" REF="35">
from the excessive commen|dation
and magnifyng of his
own Countrey; for it is too
much observed, that the En|glish
suffer themselves to be
too mvch transported with
this subject, to undervalue
and vilifie other Countreys,
for which I have heard them
often censured. The Earth is
the Lords, and all the
corners thereof, he ereated the
Mountaines of Wales, as
well as the Wiles of Kent,
the rugged Alpes, as well as
the Fertile plaines of Cam|pagnia,
the boggy fennes of
Frizeland, as well as the
daintiest Valleys in France;
and to inveigh against, or
deride a Countrey for the
barrenesse thereof, is tacit|ly
<PB N="62" REF="36">
to taxe God Almighty
of Improvidence or Partiali|ty.
And it had beene
wished, some had beene
more temperate in this
theme at their being in the
Spanish Court, in the yeare
1623. For my part, as
the Great Philosopher holds
it for a maxime, that Moun|taignous
people, are the most
pious; so are they observed to
be the hardiest, as also the
barrener a Countrey is, the
more Masculine and Warlike
the spirits of the Inhabitants
are, having as it were more
of men in them; Witnesse
the Scythian and Goth, and
other rough-hewen hungry
Nations, which so often
over-ranne Italy, for all her
<PB N="63" REF="36">
Policy and Learning; and
herein Nature may seeme to
recompence the hard con|dition
of a Countrey the
other way.</P>
<P>Having passed the Py|reneys
hee shall palpably
discerne (as I have ob|served

and strangest difference
'twixt the Genius and
Garb of two People,
though distant but by a
very small separation, as
betwixt any other upon

I knowe Nature delights

differ not onely Acci|dentally
and Outwardly in

part to the study of the Law

the one is Creatura sine Praete|rito
&amp; Futuro, the other hath
too much of both; the one

Epinetheus; the one appre|hends
and forgets quickly, the

and better fixed, &amp; in se re|conditum;
the one will dis|patch
the weightiest affaires
as hee walke along in the

upon the least occasion
of businesse will retire so|lemnly
to a room, and if a
Fly chance to hum about
him, it will discompose his
thoughts, and puzzle him:
It is a kind of sicknesse for a

long, and all the drugs of E|gypt
cannot get it out of a
Spaniard.</P>
<P>The French capacity,
though it apprehend and as|sent
unto the Tenets of
Faith, yet he resteth not
there, but examines them by
his owne reason, debates the

so is often gravelled upon the

<P>ANd truly I have many
times and oft busied my
spirits, and beaten my brains
hereupon, by taking infor|mation
from dead and living
men, and by my own practi|call
observations, to know
the true cause of this strange
antipathy betwixt two such
potent and so neare neigh|bouring
Nations, which
bringeth with it such mis|chiefe
into the World; and
keepes Christendome in a
perpetuall alarme: For al|though
the Ill Spirit bee the
principall Author thereof, as
<PB N="77" REF="43">
being the Father and fomen|ter
of all discord and hatred
(it being also part of the
Turkes letany, that warres
should continue still betweene
these two potent Nations) to
hinder the happy fruit that
might grow out of their V|nion:
yet neverthelesse it
must bee thought that hee
cannot shed this poyson, and
sow these cursed tares, un|lesse
hee had some grounds
to work his designe upon.</P>
<P>And to fly to the ordina|ry
termes of Sympathy and 
Antipathy, I know it is the 
common refuge of the igno|rant,
when being not able to
conceive the true reason of na|turall
Actions and Passions in
divers things, they fly to inde|finite
<PB N="78" REF="44">
generality, and very
often to these inexplicable
termes of Sympathy and An|tipathy.</P>
<P>Some as Doctor Garcia,
 and other Philosophicall
Authors, attribute this op|position
to the qualities of the
clymes and influences of the
Stars, which are known to beare
sway over all Sublunary bodies,
insomuch that the position of
the Heavens; and Constellati|ons,
which hang over Spaine, 
being of a different vertue and
operation to that of France, 
the temper and humours of the
Natives of the one, ought to
bee accordingly disagreeing
with the other.</P>
<P>An opinion which may
gaine credit and strength from
<PB N="79" REF="44">
the authority of the famous
 Hippocrates, who in his Book
of Ayre, Water, and Climes,
affirmeth that the diversity of
Constellations, cause a diversi|ty
of Inclinations, of humors
and complexions; and make
the bodies whereupon they ope|rate,
to receive sundry sorts of
impressions. Which reason
may have much apparance of
truth, if one consider the diffe|ring
fancies of these two Nati|ons,
as it hath reference to the
Predominant Constellations,
which have the vogue, and
qualifie the Seasons amongst
them.</P>
<P>For then when the heate be|ginneth
in Spaine, the vio|lence
thereof lasteth a long time
without intension, or remission,
<PB N="80" REF="45">
or any considerable change, the
humour of the Spaniard is just
so, for if he resolves once upon
a thing, he perseveres, he pon|ders
and dwels constantly upon
it, without wavering from his
first deliberation; it being
one of his prime axiomes, that
 Deliberandum est diu, quod
statuendum est semel.</P>
<P>It is farre otherwise in
France, for be it Sommer or
 Winter, Autumne orSpring,neither the cold nor heate, nor
serenity of Ayre continueth
nere so long, without a sen|sible
vicissitude and change; so
that it may be truly said there
in the morning,
<Q>Nescis quid serus Vesper
trahat.</Q>
<PB N="81" REF="45">
Therefore it being granted that
all Elementary bodies depend
upon the motion and vertue of
the Heavenly; the people of
France must of necessity par|take
of the inconstancy of the
Clime, both in their passions
and dispositions.</P>
<P>But this reason though pro|bable
enough, resolves not the
question to the full; for al|though
we should acknowledge,
that the Celestiall bodies by
their influxions, do domineere
over Sublunary creatures, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">osse and tumble the humours
and the masse of bloud, as they
list; it cannot be said, notwith|standing,
that this vertue ex|tends
to those actions that de|pend
immediatly upon the abso|lute
empire of the Will, with
<PB N="80" REF="46">
the other faculties and powers
of the soule, which are meerely
Spirituall, as Love and Hatred,
with the like.</P>
<P>They that dispute thus, have
much reason on their side, yet if
we consider well the order and
method that our Understand|ing
and Wils do use in the pro|duction
of their actions, we shal
find, that the influence of the
Heavenly bodies must have
something to do therein, though
indirectly and accidentally:
for all Terrestriall creatures
by a graduall kind of subordi|nation,
being governed by the
Heavenly, it must needs follow
that whatsoever is naturall in
man, as the organs of the body,
and all the senses must feele the
power of their influence.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="46">
Now is the Soule so united
and depends so farre upon the
senses, that she cannot produce
any act, unlesse they ministeri|ally
concurre and contribute
thereunto, by presenting the
matter to her, which is the in|telligibles
species: Whence it ne|cessarily
comes to passe, that in
regard of this straight league
and bond, which is betweene
them, she partakes somewhat,
and yealds to that dominion,
which the Starres have over
the sensuall appetite, which to|gether
with the Will, are dis|possed
off, and incited (I will
not say forced) by their in|fluxes.</P>
<P>And as that famous Wi|sard, 
the oldest of the Trisme|gisti, did hold, that the Intel|ligences
<PB N="84" REF="47">
which are affixed to
every Spheare, doe worke
through the organs of the body
upon the faculties of the mind,
(an opinion almost as old as
the World it selfe) so it may
be said more truly, that by the
sensuall appetite, by the frailty
and depravation of the will, the
Heavenly bodies worke very
farre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">upon the Spirituall Pow|ers
and passions of the Soule;
and affect them diversly,
though by accident and indi|rectly,
as I said before. The
position therefore of the Hea|vens
and Asterismes, which go|verne
the Spanish Clime, be|ing
different in their vertue
and operations to them of
France, the Minds and Fan|cies
of both People, must by a
<PB N="85" REF="47">
necessary consequence bee also
different.</P>
<P>Yet notwithstanding that
this assertion be true, yet it
doth not follow, that the
Influxions of the Starres and
diversity of Climes, are the
sole cause of this Antipathy
and Aversenesse, for there are
many Nations which live un|der
farre more distant and
differing Climes, which dis|affect
not one another in that
degree, therefore there must
be some other concurring
Accidents and extraordinary
motive of this evill.</P>
<P>I reade it upon record in
the Spanish Annales, that
Lewis the eleventh desiring a
personall Conference with
the King of Castile, they
<PB N="84" REF="48">
both met upon the borders,
the Spaniards came full of
Iewels and Gold Chaines
and richely apparelled:
Lewis, though otherwise, a
wise and gallant Prince, yet
had he an humor of his own,
to weare in his hat a Me|daille
of Lead, which he did
at this enterview, nor were
his attendants, but Regis ad
Exemplum&punc; but meanely ac|coutred;
which made the
Spaniards despise them, and
make disdainefull Libels of
them, which broake out af|terwards
into much contempt
and disaffection, which came
to bee aggravated more and
more.</P>
<P>And if we say that the
Devill made use of this oc|casion
<PB N="85" REF="48">
to engender that vio|lent
Hatred, which raignes
between these two Nations,
it would not bee much from
the purpose, for the least ad|vantage
in the World is suffici|ent
for him to iufuse his venom
where he finds hearts never so
little disposed to receive it, ei|ther
by naturall or contingent
causes.</P>
<P>Adde hereunto the vast
extent of greatnesse the Spa|niard
is come to within these
Sixe score yeares, by his sun|dry
new acquest, which fils
the French full of jealousies,
of emulation, and apprehen|sion
of feare; and 'tis an old
Aphorisme, Oderunt omnes,
quem metuunt.</P>
<P>Furthermore, another
<PB N="84" REF="49">
concurring motive may be,
that there passe usually o|ver
the Pyreneys, from
Gascoigne and Bearne great
numbers of poore French
tatterdimallians, being as it
were the Scumme of the
Countrey, which do all
the fordid and abject of|fices
to make a purse of
money, whereof Spaine
is fuller than France&punc; from
Spaine also there come to
France many poore Spani|ards
to bee cured of the
Kings Evill; the common
people of both Nations
measuring the whole by
the part&punc; and thinking all
to be such, it must needs
breed mutuall apprehensi|ons
of disdaine and aver|sion
<PB N="89" REF="49">
between them; so that
what was at first Acci|dentall
seemes in tract of
time, and by these degrees
to diffuse it selfe like Ori|ginall
sinne f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">om Father to

<P>ANd now being come
from France to Spaine,
make accoump for matter of
fertility of soyle, that you are
come from Gods blessing, to the
warme Sun, who is somewhat
too liberall of his beames
here; which makes the
ground more barren, and
consequently to be a kind of
Wildernesse in comparison
of France, if you respect the
number of People, the mul|titude
of Townes, Hamlets,
and Houses: for about the
the third part of con|tinent
of Spaine is made
up of huge craggie Hils and
<PB N="87" REF="50">
Mountaines, amongst which
one shall feele in some places
more difference in point of
temper of heat and cold in
the ayre, then 'wixt Winter
and Sommer under other
Climes. But where Spaine
hath water and Valleis there
she is extraordinarily fruitfull
such blessings humility carieth
alwayes with her. So that
Spaine yeeldeth to none of
her neighbours in perfection
of any thing, but only in
Plenty; which I beleeve was
the ground of a Proverbe
they have amongst them,
No ay cosa mala en Espana,
sino lo que habla, there is no|thing
ill in Spaine, but that
which speakes: And did
Spaine excell in Plenty, as she
<PB N="92" REF="51">
doth in perfection of what she
produceth, specially did she
abound in Corne, whereof
she hath not enough for the
fortieth mouth, as also had
she Men enough whereof,
besides the Warres, so many
Colonies draine her, shee
would prove formidable to
all her Neighbours.</P>
<P>But let the French glory
never so much of their
Country as being the richest
embroidery of Nature upon
Earth, yet the Spaniard drinks
better Wine, eates better
Fruits, weares finer Cloth,
hath a better Sword by his
side, and is better Mounted
than he.</P>
<P>Being entred Spaine, he
must take heed of Posting in
that hot Countrey in the
<PB N="93" REF="51">
Summer time, for it may
stirre the masse of bloud too
much. When hee comes to
Madrid (for I know no other
place secure enough for a
Protestant Gentleman to
live in, by reason of the resi|dence
of our Ambassador)
he may take new Spanish ser|vants,
for I presume he dis|charged
his French when he
forsooke Paris: There hee
shall find the King constant
all the Seasons of the yeare
in the midst of his Kingdom,
as the heart in the body, or the
Sun in the Firmament, whence
the one giveth vigor to the lit|tle
world, th' other to the great
in equall proportion. And the
first thing he must fall to, is
Language, which hee shall
find far more easie than the

French, for in point of crab|bednesse
there is as much
difference betweene the
French and Spanish, as 'twixt
Logique and Philosophy, the

may attaine both these Lan|guages,

<P>I presume by the helpe of

an introduction into the Spa|nish
tongue before hee left

France, so that in one Som|mer

come to speake it discour|sively,
and to good purpose;
being in my judgement the
easiest of all Languages, by
reason of the openesse, and
fulnesse of pronunciation,
the agreement 'twixt the
Tongue and the Text, and the
freedome from Apostrophes,
which are the knots of a Lan|guage,
as also for the proxi|mity
it hath with the Latine,
for the Spanish is nought else
but mere Latine, take a few
Morisco words away, which

<L>Lubricas, sodomiticas, dolosas,</L>
<L>Machinando fraudes cautelosas,</L>

entertainment for Verse, and
Guevara for pure Prose: Nor
shall he be distracted with
that confusion of Authors,
as in France, and else where,
for the Spaniard writes seldom
but soundly, and in a quite
differing straine from other
Nations of Christendome,
savouring rather of an Afri|can
fancy, which argues that
the Moore did much mingle
with him.</P>

highest florish never had the

this day.</P>
<P>There he may converse

them, what they have been
many yeares a gathering:
And very materiall it is to
know here, as every where
else, what commodities the
Countrey affoordeth most
usefull for us, either for ne|cessity
or pleasure: And what
English commodities are
there in greatest request, and
what proportions the Market
usually beareth, for in the
commutative part of Govern|ment
and Mercantile affaires,
lieth the most usefull part of po|licy
'twixt Countrey and Coun|trey;

better in Italy, where
the Prince holdeth it no dis|paragement
to co-adventure,
and put in his stake with the

Marchant: So that the old
Clodian Law is now of no
force at all amongst them.</P>
<P>From South Spaine he may

<P>How the state of the Pope|dome

the forces of their neighbours,
and so most proper to be Um|pires
of all quarrels.</P>
<P>How the Dominions of

<P>How Germany cut out in|to

He must observe the qua|lity
of the power of Princes,
how the Cavalry of France,
the Infantery of Spaine, and
the English Ships, leagued

the Ottoman Tyrant out of

<P>How the power of the

the Dane, the Swede,

so many, they serve only to
balance themselves, who if
<PB N="116" REF="62">

terrible to all the rest.</P>
<P>Spaine in point of treasure
hath the advantage of them al,
She hath a Veteran Army al|ways
afoot; but She is thinne
peopled, She hath many Colo|nies
to supply, which lye squan|dred
up and down in disadvan|tagious
unsociable distances,
Her people are disaffected by
most nations, and incompa|tible
with some; She wants
bread, She hath bold accessible
coasts, and Her West Indy
Fleet, besides the length of the
passage, and incertainty of ar|rivall,
is subject to casualties
of Sea, and danger of interce|ption

<PB N="117" REF="62">
with Her in good earnest into
acts of hostility, those Islands,
which the English have peo|pled,
colonized, and fortified
lately (being warned by Saint
Christopher) in the carrere to
Her mines, would be found to
be no small disadvantage to
Her.</P>
<P>France swarmes with men,
and now (more than ever)
with Soldiers, She is a body
well compacted (though often
subject to Convulsions, and
high fits of Feavers, the bloud
gathering up by an unequall
diffusion into the upper parts)
and it is no small advantage to
Her, that Her forme is circu|lar,
so that one part may quickly
run, to succour the other: She
abounds with Corne, and being
<PB N="116" REF="63">
the thorough fare of Christen|dome,
She can never want
money; She hath those three
things which the Spaniard
said would make Her eternall,
viz. Rome, the Sea, and
Counsell; for She hath the
the Pope for Her friend (ha|ving
had his breeding in Her
twenty years together) Shee
hath Holland for Her Arse|nall,
and Richelieu for Coun|sell;
who since he sate at the

attempt, with that monstrous
cours of Felicity: They of the
Religion, are now Town-lesse,
and Arme-lesse, and so are Her
greatest Peeres most of them
out of Office and Provinciall
command. So that if one would
go to the intrinsique value of
<PB N="117" REF="63">
things, France will not want
much in weight of the vast
unweldy bulk, and disjointed
body of the Spanish Monar|chie.</P>
<P>Great Britaine being encir|cled
by the Sea, and there being
an easie going out for the Na|tives,

for Strangers, and having so
many invincible Castles in
motion (I meane Her Ships)
and abounding inwardly with
all necessaries, and breeding
such men, that I may well say,
no King whatsoever hath more
choyce of able bodies to make
Soldiers of, having also most of
Her trade intrinsique, with
many other Insulary advan|tages,
She need not feare any
one Earthly power, if She bee
<PB N="120" REF="64">
true to Her selfe; yet would
She be puzzled to cope with
any of the other two single, un|lesse
it be upon the defensive
part, but joyning with Holland
She can give them both the
Law at Sea, and leaguing with
any of the other two, She is a|ble
to put the third shrewdly
to it.</P>
<P>Now it cannot be denied, but
that which giveth the greatest
check to the Spanish Monarchy
is France: And there is no
lesse truth than caution in that
saying, that the yeaue of the
Conquering of France, is the
morning of the Conquest of
England (and vice versa.) It
hath not been then without good
reason of State, that England
since that monstruous height of
<PB N="121" REF="64">
power that Spaine is come to
of late, hath endeavoured ra|ther
to strengthen France (to
beare up against Her) than to
enfeeble Her, having contri|buted
both her power and purse
to ransome one of her Kings, at
that time when Spaine began
to shoot out Her braunches so
wide: Besides, during the last
Ligue, which raged so long
through all the bowels of
France with that fury, when
there was a designe to Canto|nize
the whole Kingdome;
Queene Elizabeth though of|fered
a part, would not accept of
it, for feare of weakning the
whole: Therefore this chaine
of reciprocall conservation, lin|king
them together so strongly;
England may well be taken for
<PB N="120" REF="65">
a sure Confederate of France,
while France containes Her
selfe within her present bounds,
but if Shee should reduce the
Spaniard to that desperate
passe in the Netherlands&punc; as
to make him throw the helve
after the hatcher, and to re|linquish
those Provinces alto|gether,
it would much alter the
case: for nothing could make
France more suspectfull to En|gland
than the addition of
those Countreyes, for thereby
they would come to be one conti|nued
piece, and so England her
overthwart neighbour, should
bee in a worse case than if the
Spaniard had them entirely to
himselfe. For it would cause
Her to put Her selfe more
strongly upon Her Guard,
<PB N="121" REF="65">
and so increase Her charge
and care.</P>
<P>To conclude this point, there
cannot be a surer maxime and
fuller of precaution for the se|curity
of England, and Her
Allies, and indeed for all other
Princes of this part of the
World, than Barnevelt gave
of late yeares, a little before he
came to the fatall block.

the likenesse and sym|pathy
of distant Nations, as
the Spaniard with the Irish,

besides my selfe, that have
noted the countenance and
condition of some people of
Italy, specially those that in|habite
Lombardy, to draw
neere unto the ancient Brit|taines
of this Island, which
argues, that the Romanes, who
had their Legions here so
many hundred yeares toge|ther,
did much mingle and
clope with them. Amongst
other particulars, the old Ita|lian
tunes and rithmes both
in conceipt and cadency,
<PB N="123" REF="66">
have much affinity with the
Welsh, (and the genius of a

<P>This agrees pat with the
fancy of the Welch Bards,
whose greatest acutenesse
consists in Agnominations

<P>HE must also observe the
number of Languages,
and difference of Dialects, as
neere as he can, in every
Countrey as hee passeth a|long.</P>
<P>The French have three di|alects,
the Wallon (vulgarly
called among themselves
Romand,) the Provensall,
(whereof the Gascon is a sub|dialect)
and the speech of
Languedoc: They of Bearne
and Navarre speak a Lan|guage
that hath affinity with
the Bascuence or the Canta|brian
tongue in Biscaie, and
<PB N="125" REF="67">
amongst the Pyrenean moun|taines:
The Armorican
tongue, which they of low
Brittaine speake (for there is
your Bas-Breton, and the
Breton-Brittonant or Breton
Gallois, who speakes French)
is a dialect of the old Brittish
as the word Armorica im|ports,
which is a meere Welsh
word, for if one observe the
Radicall words in that Lan|guage
they are the same that
are now spoken in Wales,
though they differ much in
the composition of their sen|tences,
as doth the Cornish:
Now some of the appro|vedst&punc;
Antiquaries positively
hold the Originall Language
of the Celtae, the true ancient
Gaules, to be Welsh: And a|mongst
<PB N="126" REF="68">
other Authors they
produce no meaner than Cae|sar
and Tacitus, to confirme
this opinion: For Caesar
saith that the Druydes of Gaule
understood the Brittish Druyds,
who it seemes were of more
account for their Philoso|phy,
because as he saith, the
Gaules came usually over to be
taught by them, which must
bee by conference, for there
were few books then: Be|sides
Tacitus in the life of Iu|lius
Agricola reporteth,
that the Language of the Brit|taines
and the Gaules little dif|fered,
I restraine my selfe to
the middle part of France cal|led
Gallia Celtica, for they of
Aquitaine spake a language
that corresponded with the
<PB N="127" REF="68">
old Spanish, they of Burgundy
and Champagny with the
German, and most part of
Provence spake Greek, there
having beene a famous Co|lony
of Grecians planted
in Marseilles: Other small
differences there are up and
down in other Provinces of
France, as the low Norman
useth to contract many
words, as he will often say,
I' ay un pet &agrave; faire, for I' ay
un petit affaire, and the Poi|ctevin
will mince the word,
and say, ma Mese, mon pese,
for ma Mere, mon Pere; but
these differences are not con|siderable.</P>
<P>The Spanish or Castilian
tongue, which is usually cal|led
Romance, and of late
<PB N="128" REF="69">
years Lengua Christiana, (but
it is called so only amongst
themselves) for a Spaniard
will commonly aske a stran|ger
whether hee can speake
Christian, that is, Castillian?
The Spanish (I say) hath but
one considerable dialect,
which is the Portugues,
which the Iewes of Europe
speake more than any other
language, and they hold that
the Messias shall come out
that Tribe, that speake the
Portingal language; other
small differences there are in
the pronunciation of the gut|turall
letters in the Castillian,
but they are of small mo|ment.
They of the King|dome
of Valencia and Catalu|nia
(Goth-land) speake rather
<PB N="129" REF="69">
a language mixed of French,
and Italian: In the Moun|taines
of Granada (the Alpu|xarras)
they speake Morisco,
that last part of Spaine that
was inhabited by the Moores,
who had possessed it above
700 yeares.</P>
<P>But the most ancient
speech of Spaine seemes to
have beene the Bascuence or
the Cantabrian tongue spo|ken
in Guipuscoa, the Asturias
and in some places amongst
the Pyrenes; but principally
in the Province of Biscaye,
which was never conquered
by Roman, Cartaginian, Goth,
Vandall or Moore, which
Nations overrunne all the
rest of Spaine, (though some
more, some lesse) therefore
<PB N="130" REF="70">
whensoever the King of
Spaine commeth to any of
the territories of Biscaye, hee
must pull off his shooes upon
the frontiers, when he treads
the first step, being as it were
Virgin holy ground. And as
it is probable that the Bascu|ence
is the primitive lan|guage
of Spaine, so doubt|lesse
the people of that
Countrey are a remnant of
the very Aborigenes, of her
first Inhabitants. For it is
an infallible Rule, that if you
desire to find out (the Indige|<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">nae)
the ancientest people or
language of a Countrey, you
must go amongst the Moun|taines
and places of fastnesse,
as the Epirotiques in Greece,
the Heylanders in Scotland,
<PB N="131" REF="70">
the Brittaines in Wales, with
whom (I meane the last) the
Biscayner doth much sym|bolize
in many things, as in
the position and quality of
ground, in his candor and
humanity towards Strangers
more than any other people
of Spaine, his cryed up An|tiquity;
for the Spaniards
confesse the ancientest race
of Gentry to have been pre|served
there: So that a Bis|cayner
is capable to be a Ca|valier
of any of the three ha|bits
without any scrutiny to
be made by the Office, whe|ther
he be, limpio de la sangre
de los Moros, that is, cleare of
the bloud of the Moores or no,
'tis enough that he be a Mon|tanero,
that he be borne a|mongst
<PB N="132" REF="71">
the Mountaines of
Biscaye. And many may
be the reasons why Hilly
people keep their standings
so well, for being inured to
labour, and subject to the in|clemency
of the Heavens,
distemperatures of Ayre, to
short Commons, and other
incommodities, they prove
the hardier and abler men,
and happily with the eleva|tion
of the ground their spi|rits
are heightned, and so
prove more couragious and
forward to repel an invading
enemy.</P>
<P>Adde hereunto, that the
cragginesse and steepinesse
of places up and down is a
great advantage to the dwel|lers,
and makes them inac|cessible,
<PB N="133" REF="71">
for they serve as
Fortresses erected by Nature
her selfe, to protect them from
all incursions: as Caesar com|plaines
of some places in
Scythia, that Difficilius erat
hostem invenire, quam vin|cere.</P>
<P>And now for further
proofe that the Cantabrian
language is the ancientest of
Spaine, I thinke it will not be
much from the purpose, if I
insert here a strange disco|very
that was made not
much above halfe a hundred
yeares ago, about the very
midle of Spaine, of the Pat|tuecos,
a people that were
never knowne upon the face
of the Earth before, though
Spaine hath been a renown'd
<PB N="134" REF="72">
famous Countrey visited and
known by many warlik Na|tions:
They were discove|red
by the flight of a Faul|con,
for the Duke of Alva
hauking on a time neere
certaine hils, not farre from
Salamanca, one of his Hauks
which he much valued, flew
over those Mountaines, and
his men not being able to
find her at first, they were
sent back by the Duke after
her; these Faulkners clam|mering
up and down, from
hill to hill and luring all a|long,
they lighted at last up|on
a large pleasant Valley,
where they spied a company
of naked Savage people,
locked in between an assem|bly
of huge crags and hils in|dented
<PB N="135" REF="72">
and hemmed in (as it
were) one in another: As
simple and Savage they
were, as the rudest people of
any of the two Indies, whereof
some thought a man on horse|back
to be one creature with the
horse: These Savages ga|zing
awhile upon them,
flew away at last into their
caves, for they were Troglo|dites,
and had no dwelling
but in the hollowes of the
rocks: The Faulconers ob|serving
well the track of the
passage, returned the next
day, and told the Duke, that
in lieu of a hauke, they had
found out a New World, a
New People never knowne
on the continent of Spaine,
since Tubal Cain came first
<PB N="136" REF="73">
thither: A while after, the
Duke of Alva went himselfe
with a Company of Musca|teers,
and Conquered them,
for they had no offensive
weapon but slings; they were
Pythagoreans, and did eat no|thing
that had life in it, but
excellent fruits, rootes and
springs there were amongst
them; they worshipped the
Sun, &amp; new Moone, their lan|guage
was not intelligible by
any, yet many of their simple
words were pure Bascuence,
and their gutturall pronuncia|tion
the very same, and a gut|turall
pronunciation is an in|fallible
badge of an ancient lan|guage;
And so they were re|duced
to Christianity, but
are to this day discernable
<PB N="137" REF="73">
from other Spaniards by their
more tawny complexions,
which proceeds from the re|verberatio~
of the Sun-beams
glancing upon those stony
mountaines wherewith they
are encircled, and on
some sides trebly fenced,
which beames reflects upon
them with a greater strength
and so tannes them.</P>
<P>But I did not think to have
stayed so long in Spain now
nor indeed the last time I
was there, but he that hath to

beleeve were there ever so
many amongst the Greeks,
though their Countrey was
indented and cut out into so
many Islands, which as they
differed in position of place,
so there was some reason
they should differ something

Touching the Latine

those I spake of before, the re|ceived

first Corrupters but it is not
so, as the Learned Bembo, and
our no lesse Learned Brere|wood

the Latine Tongue grew to
perfection by certaine de|grees,
and in Caesar and Cice|ro's
times (whereof the one
for purity, the other for co|piousnesse,
were the best that
ever writ) she came to the
highest flourish together

insensible degrees of corru|ption
<PB N="142" REF="76">
amongst the vulgar, and
intrinsique changes in her

the capitulations of Peace
'twixt Rome and Carthage in
Polybius his time: And e|very
one knowes what kind
of Latine stands upon record
on the Columna Rostrata in
the Capitoll, in memory of
the famous Navall victory
of Duillius the Consull,
which happened but 150

So that as before, so after Ci|cero's

of Italy, or the Oyle and Sal|lets
of Spaine.</P>
<P>Some also there are who
by their Countenance more
than by their Cariage, by
their Diseases, more than by
their Discourses, discover
themselves to have been A|broad
under hot Climats.</P>
<P>Others have a custome to
bee always relating strange
things and wonders, (of the
humor of Sir Iohn Mande|vile)
and they usually pre|sent
them to the Hearers,
through multiplying glasses,
and thereby cause the thing
to appeare far greater than it
is in it self, they make Moun|taines
of Mole-hils, like Cha|renton-Bridge-Eccho,
which

times. Such a Traveller was
he, that reported the Indian
Fly, to be as big as a Fox;
China birds, to be as big as
some Horses, and their Mice
to be as big as Monkeys; but
they have the wit to fetch
this far enough off, because
the Hearer may rather believe
it, than make a voyage so far
to disprove it.</P>
<P>Every one knowes the
Tale of him, who reported hee
had seen a Cabbage under whose
leafes a Regiment of Soul|diers
were sheltred from a
shower of raine: Another
who was no Traveller (yet
the wiser man) said, hee had
passed by a place where there
were 400 brasiers making of a
Cauldron, 200 within, and
<PB N="178" REF="94">
200 without, beating the nayles
in; the Traveller asking for
what use that huge Cauldron
was? he told him, Sir it was to
boyle your Cabbage.</P>
<P>Such another was the Spa|nish
Traveller, who was so
habituated to hyperbolize,
and relate wonders, that he
became ridiculous in al com|panies,
so that he was forced
at last to give order to his
man, when he fell into any
excesse this way, and report
any thing improbable, he
should pul him by the sleeve:
The Master falling into his
wonted hyperboles, spoke of a
Church in China, that was ten
thousand and yards<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> long; his man
standing behind and pulling
him by the sleeve, made him
<PB N="179" REF="94">
stop suddenly: the compa|ny
asking, I pray Sir, how
broad might that Church
be? he replyed, but a yard
broad, and you may thanke my
man for pulling me by the
sleeve, else I had made it foure-square
for you.</P>
<P>Others have another kind
of hyperbolizing vaine, as they
will say, there's not a woman
in Italy, but weares an Iron
girdle next her skin in the ab|sence
of her husband, that for
a pistoll one may be master of
any mans life there; That there
is not a Gentleman in France
but hath his box of play <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word">
about him; That in Germany
every one hath a rouse in his
pate, once a day; That there
are few Dons in Spaine that eat
<PB N="180" REF="95">
flesh once a week, or that hath
not a Mistresse besides his wife;
That Paris hath more Courti|zans
than London honest Wo|men
(which may admit a
double sense;) That Sevill
is like a chesse-bord table, ha|ving
as many Moriscos as Spa|niards;
That Venice hath
more Maquerelles, than Mar|chands;
Portugall more Iews
than Christians: whereas i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc;
is farre otherwise, for the De|vill
is not so black as he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word">
painted, no more are these
Noble Nations and Townes as
they are tainted: Therefore
one should&punc;
<Q>Parcere paucorum diffunder<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">

<PB N="181" REF="95">
And it is a generous kind of
civility to report alwayes the
best.</P>
<P>Furthermore, there is a|mongst
many others (which
were too long to recite here)
an odde kind of Anglicisme&punc;
wherein some do frequently
expresse themselves, as to
say Your Boores of Holland,
Sir; Your Iesuites of Spaine,
Sir; Your Courtisans of Ve|nice,
Sir: whereunto one
answered (not impertinent|ly)
My Courtisans Sir? Pox
on them all for me, they are none
of my Courtisans.</P>
<P>Lastly, some kind of Tra|vellers
there are, whom their
gate and strouting, their ben|ding
in the hammes, and shoul|ders,
and looking upon their
<PB N="182" REF="96">
legs, with frisking and singing
do speake them Travellers.</P>
<P>Others by a phantastique
kind of ribanding themselvs,
by their modes of habit, and
cloathing (and touching vari|ety
of cloathing, there be cer|taine
odde ill-favoured old
Prophecies of this Island,

<P>BVt such Travellers as
these may bee termed
Land-lopers, as the Dutchman
saith, rather than Travellers;
Such may be said to go out
upon such an Arrand, as wee
reade Saules-son went once
out upon; or like the Prodi|gall
son, to feed upon the
huskes of strange Countreys;
or as we reade, Aesope travel|led
to Istria, thence to Afric<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">,
<PB N="188" REF="99">
and sundry other Regions,
only to find out the best
Crabs; or like him who came
from the furthest parts
of Hungary to England, to
eate Oysters: These Travel|lers
in lieu of the Ore of Ophir
wherwith they should come
home richly freighted, may
be said to make their returne
in Apes and Owles, in a carga|zon
of Complements and
Cringes, or some huge mon|strous
Periwigs, which is the
Golden Fleece they bring o|ver
with them.</P>
<P>Such, I say, are a shame
to their Countrey abroad,
and their kinred at home, and
to their parents, Benonies, the
sons of sorrow: and as Ionas
in the Whales belly, travelled
<PB N="189" REF="99">
much, but saw little, why, be|cause
hee was shut up in the
body of that great (aqua|tique)
beast, so these may be
said to have been carried up
and downe through many
Countreys, and after a long
pererration to and fro, to re|turne
as wise as they went,
because their soules were so
ill lodged, and shut up in such
stupid bodies: No, an inge|nious
and discerning Travel|ler
will disdaine this, and
strive to distinguish 'twixt
good and evill, 'twixt that
which is gracefull, and
what's phantastique, 'twixt
what is to be followed, and
what's to be shunned, and
bring home the best: Hee
will strive to be rather Sub|stance
<PB N="190" REF="100">
without shew, than shew
without substance: From the
Italian he will borrow his
reservednesse, not his jealousie
and humor of revenge; From
the French his Horsemanship
and gallantnesse that way,
with his Confidence, and no|thing
else: From the Spani|ard
his Sobriety, not his lust:
From the German (cleane
contrary) his Continency, no:
his Excesse, the other way:
From the Netherland his In|dustry,
and that's all: His
heart must still remaine En|glish,
though I allow him
some choyce and change of
Habit,

<PB N="191" REF="100">
And as the commendablest
quality of Oyle is to smell of
nothing, yet it giveth an ex|cellent
relish to many sorts
of meats: So he is the dis|creetest
Traveller, who Sa|voureth
of no affectation; or
strangenesse, of no exotique
modes at all, after his returne,
either in his Cariage or Dis|cours,
unlesse the subject re|quire
it, and the occasion and
Company aptly serve for
him, to discover himselfe,
and then an application of
his Knowledge abroad, will
excellently season his matter
and serve as golden d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">shes

<P>If any Forrainer be to be
imitated in his manner of
Discours and Comportement,
<PB N="192" REF="101">
it is the Italian, who may be
said to be a medium 'twixt
the Gravity of the Spaniard,
the Heavinesse of the Dutch,
and Levity of our next
Neighbours, for he seemes
to allay the one, and quicken
the other two; to serve as a
buoy to the one, and a ballast
to th'other.</P>
<P>France useth to work one
good effect upon the English,
she useth to take away the
mothers milk (as they say,)
that blush, and bashfull tin|cture,
which useth to rise up
in the face npon sudden sa|lutes,
and enterchange of
Complement, and to enhar|den
one with confidence;
For the Gentry of France
have a kind of loose becom|ming
<PB N="193" REF="101">
boldnes, and forward
vivacity in their cariage,
whereby they seeme to draw
respect from their Superiours
and Equals, and make their
Inferiours keepe a fitting di|stance.</P>
<P>In Italy amongst other
morall cautions, one may
learne not to be over prodigall
of speech when there is no
need, for with a nod, with a
shake of the head, and shrug of
the shoulder, they will answer
to many questions.</P>
<P>One shall learne besides
there not to interrupt one in
the relation of his tale, or to
feed it with odde interlocuti|ons:
One shall learne also
not to laugh at his own jest, as
too many use to do, like a Hen,
<PB N="194" REF="102">
which cannot lay an egge but
she must ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">kle.</P>
<P>Moreover, one shall learne
not to ride so furiously as they
do ordinarily in England,
when there is no necessity at
all for it; for the Italians
have a Proverb, that a gallop|ping
horse is an open sepulcher.
And the English generally
are observed by all other
Nations, to ride commonly
with that speed, as if they
rid for a Midwife, or a Phy|sitian,
or to get a pardon to
save one's life as he goeth to
execution, when there is no
such thing, or any other oc|casion
at all, which makes
them call England, the Hell
of Horses.</P>
<P>In these hot Countreyes
<PB N="195" REF="102">
also, one shall learne
to give over the habit of
an odde custome, peculiar
to the English alone, and
whereby they are distin|guished
from other Nati|ons,
which is, To make
still towards the Chimney,

<P>LAnguage is the greatest
outward testimony of
Travell: Yet is it a vaine and
verball Knowledge that rests
only in the Tongue; Nor are
the observations of the Eye
any thing profitable, unlesse
the Mind draw something
from the Externe object to en|rich
the Soule withall, to in|forme
to build up and unbe|guile
the Inward man, that
by the sight of so various ob|jects

at the best is but a huge Inne,
and we but wayfaring men, but
Pilgrimes, and a company of
rambling Passengers. That
we enter first into this World
by Travaile, and so passe along,

So that it was no improper

<P>In Carthage, the Senat

<P>In Athens the Rich were
not suffered to be Extortioners,

<P>In Rhodes Old men were
Venerable, Young men modest,

<P>In Thebes the Nobles
did fight, the Plebeians la|bour,

<P>In Sicily Iustice was en|tirely

Water, neere the conditi|on
of brute animals, who find
the cloth always ready layed, &amp;
the buttry open: When hee
hath observed what a hard

a dwelling in the holes of the
Rocks; others to dig one un|der
the Sea; when he feeles,
how in some Climes the
Heaven is as Brasse, in others

as a dropping Sponge; in o|thers
as a great Bellowes, most

those rayes which scorch the

At his returne home, hee

there is no where the like,

<P>HAving thus tasted of

next cours should bee, to
settle himselfe awhile in

(which hee may do and
yet bee a Courtier besides)
to understand something of
the Common Lawes of En|gland,
which are the inheri|tance
of every subject, as al|so
<PB N="218" REF="114">
of the constitutions and

most wholesome, and No|blest

in the World, both in re|spect
of King and People:
It being the greatest glory of
a King, to be King of a free
and well-crested people, and
the greatest glory of a People
to bee under a Crown so em|bellished
with Flowers, and
sparckling with such ancient
and sacred gemmes of Royall
Prerogatives: Yet to bee un|der
no Law but of their

Contribution or Taxe, but
what is granted in that great
Epidemicall Counsell, wherein
every one from the Peere to

Vote. And if every de|gree
high and low, both in
Towne and Countrey is there
represented by their Subsi|stutes;
it were a hard mea|sure
(under correction, I
humbly speake it) if the
Levites, the best of all pro|fessions,
who besides the ho|linesse
of their function (as
having charge of the Nobler
halfe of man, of that which
should guide and regulate
the Understanding in making
of all Lawes, I meane the
Conscience) do make a con|siderable
part of the People
<PB N="220" REF="115">
of the Kingdome, should be
thence excluded; for though
it be inconsistent with their
calling to have hands to exe|cute,
yet they may well have
heads to consult in that great
Nationall Senat: It were a
hard case, I say, if those great
Lights, which were used to
shine with that brightnesse
to the Envy (not the reproach
or Scandall of any that I
know of) of all other Re|formed
Churches, should be
now put in wooden Candle|sticks:
That those Promo|tions,
Endowments, and
Honors, which our well di|sposed
Progenitors provided,
to nourish the Arts, and
serve as Spurres to Learning
and Zeale, should now be cut
<PB N="221" REF="115">
off, as if they served only for
Stirrops to Pride. There be|ing
no professions, but have
certaine steps of rising up,
and degrees of Promotion
for their encouragement to
make men aemulari meliora.
And he who hath spent the
vigor of his yeares and Intel|lectuals
in the Lords Vine|yard,
it may well become
him (having served, as it
were, his yeare of Iubile) to
have his gray haires dignifi|ed
with some Honor and
Authority, with reward and
rest in his old age, and by his
long experience and paines
to see that other painefull
Labourers be put into the
Vine-yard, yet to have his
hand often on the Plough
<PB N="222" REF="116">
himselfe. If there bee a
theefe in the Candle, (as wee
use to say commonly) there
is a way to pull it out; and
not to put out the Candle, by
clapping an Extinguisher pre|sently
upon it; If these Lights
grow dim, there is a Trienni|all
Snuffer for them: If these
Trees beare not good fruit,
or shoot forth any Luxuriant
boughs, they are sure to feele
the Pruning iron once every
three yeares.</P>
<P>In the name of God, let
these Lights be brought to
move within the circumfe|rence
of their own Orbes, and
be kept from irregular and
eccentrique motions, And I
am confident it will render
them lesse obnoxious to En|vy
<PB N="223" REF="116">
and Scandall, and draw
upon them a greater opini|on
of Reverence.</P>
<P>There is a Castle in the
grand Caire in Aegypt, called
the Nilescope, where there
stands a Pillar with certaine
markes to observe the height
of the River of Nile, at her
annuall inundation (which
fals out precisely about the
Summer Solstice) if the
streame come to bee higher
or lower than such markes, it
portends dearth, but if at
highest floud it rest about the
middle, it is an infallible
presage of a plentifull yeare:
So we may say of these great
Streames that are appointed
to water the Lords Field,
they must not swell too high,
<PB N="224" REF="117">
nor must they run in too low
a Channell: And as humility
is the fairest gemme that can
shine in a Prelats Miter, so the
greatest badge of a well devoted
Soule, is to reverence the Dis|pensers
of the sacred Oracles of
God, the Ghostly Fathers, and
Governors of the Church,
(which in analogy to the
Triumphant in Heaven, hath
also her degrees of Hierarchy.)
For besides Revenue there is
a Veneration, due to this holy
function, and it were no hard
matter to produce a Gran
Iury of examples both Hu|mane
and Divine, that where
this Reverence fayled, it hath
been a symptome, and an in|fallible
presage of a declining
State, or some approaching
judgement.</P>
