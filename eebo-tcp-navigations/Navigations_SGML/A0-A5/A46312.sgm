<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Brief and Exact Account of the Be&s;ieging and Taking of &s;uch an Important Place as the City of <HI>Mentz,</HI> cannot but be acceptable to all &s;orts of Per&s;ons, not excepting that Party that lo&s;t it; For in it they will ob&s;erve the Candor of a Generous Conqueror, who gives all the Prai&s;es to his Enemies that they de&s;erve: He omits nothing of Importance that the Be&s;ieged did to defend them&s;elves, and he lays down the advantageous Articles upon which this Strong Place was &s;urrender'd. Here even Generals, and Subordinate Field-Officers, will have a full View of tho&s;e Methods which tho&s;e brave <HI>Hero's</HI> who attack'd it, did ob&s;erve. The Inferiour Officers will &s;ee with what Cou|rage and Valour they led on tho&s;e Men which each command|ed in their re&s;pective Po&s;ts. The Common Centries will be fill'd with a Generous Envy and Emulation, to imitate tho&s;e that were employ'd in this Remarkable Siege: And even &s;uch Per&s;ons as are not addicted to Arms, will find a Delight in Reading with what Bravery it was Attack'd and Defended:
<PB REF="3">The rather, becau&s;e that this Relation of it has been tran&s;|mitted to us by an Eminent Officer, who had a great Share in the Action, and that was an Eye-Witne&s;s of the greate&s;t part of the whole Proceeding, &s;o far as the Con&s;iderable Em|ploy which he had, would permit him: And where his Eye could not reach, he made u&s;e of &s;o exact an Inqui&s;ition from tho&s;e who Commanded in their re&s;pective Po&s;ts, that it will give &s;ufficient Satisfaction. In a word, This is the mo&s;t Ex|act Journal that could be made of &s;uch a Siege. I &s;hall no longer detain the Ingenious Reader from &s;atisfying his Curio|&s;ity therein.</P>

<P><HI>June</HI> 21.</P>
<P>HIS Sereni&s;&s;ime Highne&s;s the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> decamped this day from <HI>Mayen</HI> with the whole Army, and having le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> a Garri&s;on of 2000 men in divers &s;mall Towns on the other &s;ide of the <HI>Mo&s;el,</HI> to cover the Country of <HI>Treves</HI> and the Towns of <HI>Cochheim, Mayen, Kay&s;er&s;eck, Andernack,</HI> and o|thers, and to fill &s;ome places &s;ituated on the <HI>Rhine,</HI> in the <HI>Ringga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> near <HI>Coblence,</HI> as al&s;o <HI>Konnig&s;tein,</HI> he marc'd that very day as far as <HI>Mun&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 22. At Noon he took up his general Quarters towards <GAP DESC="blank"> on the <HI>Mo&s;el,</HI> where he caus'd the Bridge of Boats to be brought, which could be put up in three hours time, and his High|ne&s;s pa&s;s'd it that very day with all the Foot, and one Regiment of Dragoons, and encamped his Troops on the other &s;ide of the <HI>Mo&s;el</HI> near <HI>Alcken,</HI> the Artillery and all the Baggage pa&s;&s;ing the River in the night.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 23. The Hor&s;e, with the re&s;t of the Dragoons, pa&s;s'd the Bridge, the re&s;olution of fording the River over, having been chan|ged; and the whole Army leaving on one &s;ide the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Eren|&s;tein,</HI> ruin'd by the <HI>French,</HI> continu'd its March the &s;ame day over high Mountains and &s;trait Pa&s;&s;es, where the Hor&s;e was oblig'd to file off.</P>
<P>The Camp was on a Line between <HI>Herwie&s;en</HI> and <HI>Buckholtz,</HI> and they advanc'd but two hours March that day.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="4">
<P>The <HI>Lunenberg</HI> Army encamp'd beyond <HI>Buckholtz,</HI> where it was come the day before, having taken its March on this &s;ide the <HI>Mo&s;el</HI> over the Mountains. The Imperiali&s;ts left Wing did reach to it: Towards night the Baggage, which had taken another way, joyn'd the Army.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 24. The Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI>'s Hor&s;e and the Dragoons, march'd fir&s;t, the Imperial Foot follow'd them, and they march'd before the Army of <HI>Lanenberg,</HI> which had plac'd it &s;elf near the way, and who&s;e Foot joyn'd that of the Imperiali&s;ts, and the Hor&s;e were to form the Reerguard. The Camp was not far from <HI>Leuningen,</HI> and it was upon two Lines.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 25. That day the Army re&s;ted. Till then there had been no talk of any con&s;iderable Motion of the Enemy, and there was a Ru|mour that there was a great Con&s;ternation among&s;t them: We had information that 14 Cornets were gone from <HI>Mayance</HI> or <HI>Mentz</HI> to|wards <HI>Homburg,</HI> that the Enemies had carried away a great number of Waggons loaded with Baggage and Wine, that they had reduc'd to a&s;hes the Cities of <HI>Landau,</HI> of <HI>Kim</HI> on the <HI>Nohe,</HI> and <HI>Key&s;erlautern.</HI> The Country-people told us al&s;o, that on the 23d a Party of 50 Hor&s;e of the Enemy had advanc'd within two miles of this place. But &s;ome Party of our Forces having been &s;ent to get intelligence of the E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">|mies Motions, return'd without information. Two De&s;erters from <HI>Mount Royal</HI> told us, that that place was furni&s;h'd with 12 Battalions, but that the Garri&s;on de&s;erted in great numbers, &s;o that &s;ome Com|panies con&s;i&s;ted but of 15 or 20 men; they al&s;o inform'd us, that a con&s;iderable Party of Dragoons had intrench'd them&s;elves at <HI>Trar|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ack</HI> under the Cannon of that Place, and that they were working with all po&s;&s;ible diligence on the Fortifications of <HI>Trarback</HI> and <HI>Mount Royal,</HI> that they were already for the mo&s;t part &s;et in a po&s;ture of defence; and that the Governour <HI>Montal</HI> did frequently &s;end out Parties to burn the Country; and that the Enemy had abandon'd the City of <HI>Treves,</HI> without burning or plundering of it, having lodg'd the Garri&s;on that was in it, in <HI>Mount Royal</HI> and <HI>Thionville.</HI></P>

<P><HI>June</HI> 26, 27. The Army remain'd tho&s;e two days in the &s;ame Camp, and there pa&s;s'd nothing of Remark: according to Country-peoples Reports, there had been &s;een near to <HI>Ca&s;tellan,</HI> not far from <HI>Creutzenach,</HI> &s;ome French Parties con&s;iderable &s;trong; but &s;ome Im|perial Parties, which were &s;ent after them, commanded by the Prince of <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">mmercy,</HI> &s;aw none of the Enemy.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 28. The Army being on its March, and having gone through &s;uch narrow Defiles, that in &s;ome places the Hor&s;e could not go but one after another, encamped between <HI>Ki&s;&s;elbach</HI> and <HI>Richereda,</HI> the Camp being po&s;ted all in a Line.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 29. We decamped again, and march'd near two hours through Defiles, on the <HI>Hund&s;ruck,</HI> to a &s;mall River named <HI>Gildenbach,</HI> which falls into the <HI>Nohe,</HI> and the great Fore&s;t of <HI>Sohn,</HI> which extends as far as <HI>Metz.</HI> The Army encamped there on two Lines.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 30. The Army re&s;ted. The &s;ame day came the old Foot Re|giment of Count <HI>Staremberg,</HI> with a Battalion of <HI>Auersberg,</HI> who had pa&s;s'd the River on the Flying Bridge, which had been brought from <HI>Coblence</HI> to <HI>Rude&s;heim.</HI></P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 1. We took that day our March through narrow Defiles, which were very trouble&s;om, high Mountains, and Woods, which la&s;t|ed above three hours; we went and encamp'd between <HI>Schwabenhau&s;on</HI> and <HI>Wald Laber&s;heim,</HI> two Villages that are di&s;tant, in a direct Line, two hours from <HI>Creutzenach</HI> and <HI>Scomberg;</HI> 2000 Foot were command|ed to hide them&s;elves in the Wood, to ob&s;erve the Enemies Motion.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="5">
<P><HI>July</HI> 2. We were ready to decamp; but becau&s;e that <HI>Newbourg</HI>'s and <HI>Palfi</HI>'s Regiments of Hor&s;e, and the Foot Regiments of <HI>New|bourg, Wirtemberg</HI> and <HI>Erf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> as al&s;o the <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> Regiment of Dra|goons (which had been left to cover the Baggage and the Artillery, on a report that the Enemy had appear'd in a Party of 500 men) were not yet return'd, and that they joyn'd us in the Camp but towards three in the Afternoon, the March was countermanded, and the whole Army remain'd encamped in the &s;ame place.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 3. That day we decamp'd, and we took our March within an hour of <HI>Creutzenach,</HI> the Camp being on two Lines, between <HI>Creutze|nach</HI> and <HI>Pret&s;enheim;</HI> in this la&s;t place was found a Ca&s;tle, who&s;e Juri&s;diction is parted betwixt <HI>Lorrain</HI> and a certain Count of <HI>Velon:</HI> that day we al&s;o work'd in the Con&s;truction of the Bridge of Boats, which had gone up the River from <HI>Coblence,</HI> that was done below <HI>Bingen,</HI> a little beneath the fall of the River <HI>Nohe,</HI> which cover'd the &s;aid Bridge; another was al&s;o made clo&s;e by on the River <HI>Nohe.</HI> General <HI>Thungen,</HI> who was commanded thither with a &s;mall Body, cau&s;ing &s;ome Forts to be rais'd, to &s;ecure the fir&s;t of the &s;aid Bridges. Since that the Bridge of Boats of <HI>Bingen</HI> was taken away, becau&s;e that his Electoral Highne&s;s of <HI>Saxony</HI> (who&s;e Army was to pa&s;s over it) de&s;ired that it &s;hould be remov'd a little higher. Which was done ac|cordingly, conveying it gently near to the Army, it was thought that it &s;hould be fix'd at <HI>Ingelheim.</HI> His Highne&s;s the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> not thinking it convenient to have it &s;o near <HI>Mayence;</HI> and thereby expos'd to the Enemies in&s;ults.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 4. We encamped that day, and a Detachment of 10 Battalions of Foot with a Regiment of Dragoons with 6 Pieces of Cannon and 4 Morters, were &s;ent to make them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of <HI>Eberbourg,</HI> a Ca&s;tle within three quarters of a mile of <HI>Creutzenach,</HI> where the French had plac'd 150 men, which the Duke of <HI>Lorra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> with the Ge|neral Officers, had been to view a little before; but tho&s;e Troops were countermanded again, after it had been con&s;ider'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> that the re|duction of that place would require four days. The &s;ame day came to the Army <HI>Caraffa</HI>'s and <HI>Commercy</HI>'s two Regiments of Hor&s;e, who had pa&s;s'd the <HI>Rhine</HI> on the Bridge of Boats at <HI>Bingen.</HI></P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 5. This day the Army decamped, and march'd one hour and half; the Camp was on two Lines, between <HI>Groltzheim</HI> and <HI>Sponheim,</HI> within an hour of <HI>Bingen.</HI></P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 6. The Army being on two Collumns, march'd during three hours through <HI>Ockenheim</HI> and <HI>Altzheim,</HI> the Hor&s;e on the right, and the Foot on the left, not far from the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and the Baggage being
<PB N="5" REF="5">inclo&s;ed between the Two Collumns, we made an Halt at <HI>Nider-Ingel|hei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">:</HI> The Enemy made no great Fire with their Cannon, with which they might have done much Damage, the Squadrons having in&s;en&s;ibly drawn too near to that place: The Rea&s;on mu&s;t be, That mo&s;t part of their Cannon was not yet mounted on the Rampert. We did not unbridle all that Night.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 7. Our Hor&s;e got a little further from that place before day, to avoid the Enemies Cannon. The Foot came that morning with the Bag|gage and the Artillery. The Camp was on one &s;ingle Line; the Re|giments of Hor&s;e and Foot being intermixed, and fronting the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ield: The Camp was extended from the <HI>Rhine,</HI> above the City, to a Wood beneath the City; but it wanted much yet from joyning the <HI>Rhine</HI> be|neath, &s;eeing that the Contravallation extends it &s;elf near Two Hours and an half. The Enemy made all the day long a great fire with their Cannon, which kill'd during tho&s;e Two Days but Twelve of our Men, and &s;ome Hor&s;es. Hitherto they made no Sallies: They po&s;t|ed Three &s;trong Hor&s;e-Guards within 2 of 300 Paces of the Counter|&s;carp, and they were &s;een to work diligently both at the <HI>Rampart</HI> and at the <HI>Glacis.</HI> A Party of Twelve Ma&s;ters of the Regiment of <HI>Pelfi,</HI> who were gone to forrage, having no other Arms but their Car|bines, brought that day to the Camp 18 Pri&s;oners from <HI>Kira,</HI> on the Notice of a <HI>French</HI> Party which was &s;trong of 20 Fool. His Electo|ral Highne&s;s of <HI>Saxony</HI> came that Day to the Camp, with his Mar&s;hal of <HI>Camp,</HI> and a &s;mall Retinue. The &s;aid Elector alighted at the Prince of <HI>Bareith</HI>'s, where the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> went to give him a Vi&s;it. They entertain'd one another for &s;ome time in private, and after that, in pre&s;ence of <HI>Mon&s;ieur Flemming,</HI> Mar&s;hal of <HI>Camp;</HI> after which his Electoral Highne&s;s pa&s;s'd over the <HI>Rhine</HI> at <HI>Ru&s;&s;el&s;heim.</HI></P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 8. That Day the Foot of <HI>Saxony</HI> pa&s;s'd the <HI>Rhine</HI> in Boats, a|bove <HI>Mayence.</HI> The Hor&s;e, which till then had encamped &s;ome time over-again&s;t <HI>Worms,</HI> was to do the &s;ame pre&s;ently after. That Day there al&s;o came into the Camp of <HI>Lorrain</HI> Two Regiments of Foot of the Prince's of <HI>Saxony,</HI> another of Hor&s;e being order'd to follow. The Enemy fired greatly their Cannon on the General Quarters, where it did &s;ome Mi&s;chief, but of no great con&s;equence: That Day there al&s;o came into the Camp a great number of Pea&s;ants to work. The Night of the 8th, till the 9th, &s;ome of the Army of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> who had been commanded, took their Po&s;t in a deep Valley near to a Mill, and open'd the Trenches within 7 or 800 paces of the Counter&s;carp on the Right. Upon this the Enemy &s;allied out, and gave an Alarm, but did &s;oon retire again.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="6">
<P><HI>July</HI> 9, 10, 11. Nothing pa&s;s'd that was con&s;iderable, except that the Trenches were much advanc'd on the Right Hand. <HI>Mon&s;ieur Flem|ming,</HI> the Camp Ma&s;ters Baggage, had almo&s;t been carried to the Ene|mies Fort on the <HI>Rhine,</HI> through the Watermens imprudence, but it was &s;aved by tho&s;e of <HI>He&s;&s;e.</HI> The 10th is Highne&s;s of <HI>Bavaria</HI> name to the Camp for &s;ome Days; His Highne&s;s the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> went to meet him on Hor&s;eback, with the Prince of <HI>Commercy.</HI> The Night of the 11th, till the 12th, tho&s;e of <HI>Saxony</HI> took their Po&s;t with 8oo Men, near to the Convent of the Nuns, beneath the Town, near the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and opened the Trench.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 12. The Trench was carried on very far that Night towards the Left, from that place where the other began, and we began to work about a Redoubt, to &s;ecure them both. The <HI>He&s;&s;eans</HI> did ca&s;t all that Night from beyond the <HI>Rhine,</HI> with Two Mortar-pieces, Bombs into the City, which caus'd therein a great Fire near to the Ca&s;tle, to|wards 10 at Night, which, as may be perceived, con&s;um'd about 8 hou|&s;es, and it was put out about Midnight.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 13. The Enemy by Day did ruine that which had been rais'd up by Night at the Redoubts. At the <HI>Lorrainers</HI> Attack they advanced far that Night in the <HI>Vignes</HI> towards the Left. There was a Line of Communication drawn al&s;o from the Attack on the Left to that on the Right, and they continued to work at the Two Redoubts which had been began. The Enemy made Four fal&s;e Sallies, but pre&s;ently retired each time. There were Four Field Pieces conducted into the Appreaches, which are &s;ometimes us'd with &s;ucce&s;s. Tho&s;e of <HI>Saxo|ny</HI> pu&s;h'd on their Approaches al&s;o on the &s;ide of the <HI>Rhine:</HI> They al|&s;o took their Po&s;ts early in the Morning in the <HI>Grand Charter-hou&s;e,</HI> which is di&s;tanc'd off 450 Paces from the Counter&s;carp, which they found to be abandon'd by the Enemy, contrary to their Opinion: However, they were met with in &s;ome Hou&s;es about &s;ome 50 paces di|&s;tance from thence, where they fortified them&s;elves, above all, in the <HI>Garden</HI> of <HI>Stadian,</HI> where they had met to the Number of 1000 men. They however attempted nothing: That Night &s;ome Pieces of Can|non of 8 or 6 pound bullets, were drawn near to the Approaches, which were not made u&s;e of however before the 10th at Night inclu|&s;ively. The Enemy fired fiercely that day on tho&s;e of <HI>Saxony; Mon|&s;ieur,</HI> the Prince <HI>Palatine, Frederick William,</HI> who was come as a Vo|lunteer in the Camp, was that day kill'd by a Falcon Bullet, at the Head of the Trench, in pre&s;ence of the Princes his Brothers, the Prince Electoral, and the Grand Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Teutonick Order,</HI> the Bullet having gone through his Head. He was carried from thence
<PB N="7" REF="6">to <HI>Franckfort,</HI> there to be embalm'd. And becau&s;e there was a De&s;ign of altering the Camp, and to form it as it was to remain all along the Siege, the General Quarter of <HI>Lorrain</HI> was di&s;lodg'd, and that of <HI>Wei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 span">aw</HI> al&s;o, and it was plac'd a little lower, near to <HI>Prazzen|heim.</HI></P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 14. The Prince of <HI>Hanover</HI> commanded with 4000 <HI>Lunenburg|ers,</HI> in the Approaches of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> which as it had been agreed on, had not been advanc'd that Night: However, there were many at work, to enlarge them, and to put them in condition of Defence: There was al&s;o Two Redoubts perfected, that were on the Right and the Left. The Enemy began to fire fiercely with their Great and Small Shot; and of this la&s;t they made whole Vollies all the Night long, e&s;|pecially from the Counter&s;carp; yet were there but Two Men kill'd, and Two wounded. They al&s;o &s;ometimes gave us Alarms, but al|ways found our Men in readine&s;s. The Trenches were enlarg'd al&s;o on the &s;ide of the <HI>Saxons,</HI> and &s;et in po&s;ture of Defence; but no|thing was advanc'd beyond that; which could not be done neither, be|fore the coming of the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> as I was inform'd by the Prince Elector, who commanded that Night in the Trenches with 1500 men.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 15. That Day we began to trace out the Lines of Circumvalla|tion, to &s;ecure the Camp towards the Field, and to hinder all &s;uccour. There were &s;ome &s;mart Skirmi&s;hes betwixt the Two Hor&s;e-Guards; Divers were kill'd on both &s;ides, and among&s;t the re&s;t of our Men was <HI>d'Andlau,</HI> Captain in <HI>Palfi</HI>'s Regiment. The Enemy took divers of our Men Pri&s;oners that were gone for Forrage, who had ventur'd above 8 hours Way from the Camp; the Number is not yet known. The Prince of <HI>Savoy</HI> came from the Camp of <HI>Bavaria</HI> into this: 'Till now the Trenches could not be carried on at the Electoral Attack, but to 450, and that of <HI>Lorrain</HI> to 500 Paces di&s;tance off the Coun|ter&s;carp. The la&s;t are pa&s;&s;ably well &s;ecur'd: Every Night there are 4000 men lodg'd in the Trenches; the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> are there Two Days together, and a Field-Mar&s;hal Lieutenant commands there every night; the <HI>Lunenburgers</HI> are there every Third Night. I believe, that in &s;o little time there never was &s;o much firing of Artillery from any City as from this; there are every Day above Four or Five Hundred Cannon Shots made: And after all it is to be wondred, that with the great firing there has been yet but Ten Men kill'd. The lo&s;s in the Approaches are al&s;o very &s;light, and will not reach in both the At|tacks to above the Number of 40 per&s;ons. Be&s;ides, the Enemy have al&s;o a con&s;iderable Number of Pieces in the Counter&s;carp. The Night
<PB N="8" REF="7">of the 15th to the 16th, the Prince of <HI>Saxe Gobourg</HI> was in the Trench, which was al&s;o carried on with the lo&s;s of but few Men.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 16. This Night the Labour of the precedent Nights was fi|ni&s;h'd, another Redoubt was made, and the Trench was advanc'd a little; The Enemy did ince&s;&s;antly give Alarms, and fired continual|ly their Cannon and Small Shot; They labour'd al&s;o on a &s;mall Work on the Left, that they might more commodiou&s;ly hinder the Approa|ches. That Night were reckon'd about 30 kill'd and wounded. A Lieutenant who had de&s;erted the City, brought to us the Platform of it, and &s;hew'd us the places where the Enemy had conducted their Mines; He believ'd al&s;o that the City was attack't in its weake&s;t part, e&s;pecially on the <HI>Lorrainers</HI> &s;ide. He further &s;aid, That the Garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ted of 8000 Men, and that it was re&s;olv'd to defend it &s;elf to the la&s;t extremity, and that it would make a very great Sally upon us, &s;o &s;oon as we were got a little nearer.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 17. The <HI>Saxon</HI> Hor&s;e, con&s;i&s;ting of 6 Regiments, namely the Regiment of Guards, Field Mar&s;hal, Baron <HI>Ilato,</HI> of the Prince <HI>Frede|rick, Promnitz,</HI> and a Regiment of the Dragoons under Collonel <HI>Mink|witz,</HI> pa&s;s'd over the Bridge of Boats, belonging to the Imperiali&s;ts, becau&s;e that of <HI>Saxony</HI> was not yet perfected. They lodg'd them&s;elves in tho&s;e Po&s;ts which had been appointed them. His Electoral High|ne&s;s of <HI>Bavaria</HI> came al&s;o at Night in the Camp; the Foot which he brings is from 5000 to 5500 Men; he pa&s;s'd the <HI>Rhine,</HI> in the Night, and this day on <HI>Pontons,</HI> a little above the Bridge. The Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> lodg'd in Per&s;on in the &s;ame Village where is the Elector of <HI>Saxony.</HI> The work of the Trench was al&s;o carried on very far this Night. The Prince of <HI>Hanover</HI> Commanded there, and there were reckoned 12 kill'd and wounded.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 18. Tho&s;e of <HI>He&s;&s;e</HI> gave the fir&s;t time 2000 of their Men for the Approaches, who work'd very well that Night about them, and they ad|vanc'd within 250 or 300 paces of the Counter&s;carp. The Enemy fired extraordinarily all that Night, yet it is to be wondered, that the lo&s;s of our Men did not exceed the number of 26 kill'd and wounded.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 19. The <HI>French</HI> was advanced a little another way al&s;o. We be|gan to rai&s;e a Battery. The Enemy fired furiou&s;ly all the Night long: the lo&s;s of our Men amounted to 28 kill'd and wounded. The Enemy &s;et fire them&s;elves to an Hou&s;e that was near the Gate. The <HI>Saxons</HI> Bridge of Boats was fini&s;hed that day. That Night we began again to work at the Electoral Attack. The Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> pa&s;s'd the whole Night in the Trenches, with a de&s;ign of po&s;ting him&s;elf near an Hou&s;e at 8 pa|ces
<PB N="9" REF="7">di&s;tant from the <HI>Charter-Hou&s;e,</HI> which till then had been the place of Arms; tho&s;e that were commanded for that de&s;ign gave back a lit|tle, perceiving the Enemy to advance in great numbers towards them, which cau&s;ed &s;ome confu&s;ion, &s;o that our own Men began to &s;hoot from the Approaches on tho&s;e that were Commanded. His Electoral High|ne&s;s of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> and the two Camp Mar&s;hals, <HI>Caprara</HI> and <HI>Flemming,</HI> and General <HI>Stenan</HI> got off luckily without being wounded, after they had a long time receiv'd the Enemies and our own &s;hot. Some days &s;ince a certain Captain was &s;eis'd, who is a <HI>French</HI> Engineer, who endea|vour'd to get into the Town, who&s;e Name is <GAP DESC="blank"> <HI>Cormaellan,</HI> of <HI>Mount Royal.</HI></P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 20 and 21. The&s;e two Nights the Trenches were very much ad|vanc'd at the Electoral Attack. They were advanc'd to 300 paces of the Counter&s;carp. There were the fir&s;t Night 60 kill'd and wounded, and the la&s;t, about 50. We continu'd to work at the Battery on the <HI>Lorrainer</HI>'s &s;ide, it is to be mounted with 30 Cannons. The Trenches were enlarg'd, and the Lines were carried on both on the Right and the Left, to make a larger Front before the Town; by that we draw nearer to the point of the Counter&s;carp, from which we have yet 150 paces di&s;tant. The&s;e two Nights there were reckoned about 40 kill'd and wounded. The Enemy, as he was wont, did continually &s;ire both his great and &s;mall Shot towards both the Attacks. They fire not &s;o furiou&s;ly now on the &s;ide of the Champion: there were for divers Nights together, &s;ome De&s;erters of our Camp that went into the City.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 22. Three <HI>French</HI> Officers &s;tole at open day from our Camp into the Town. The work of the Trenches was a little retarded this Night at both the Attacks, through the violent Rain which fell, however the labour of the two precedent Nights were accom|pli&s;hed at the Electoral Attack; and at the <HI>Lorrainers</HI> Attack, there was a little work done at the great Battery. The fir&s;t Night we had about Nine kill'd and wounded, and the la&s;t Night, about Four|teen. Tho&s;e of <HI>He&s;&s;e</HI> did ca&s;t all the Night long, from the o|ther &s;ide of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> Bombs in the Town, out of 4 Mortar-pieces. The Enemy gave that Night a Sign in kindling a Fire on the great Tower; we conjectur'd it was to give <HI>Duras</HI> notice of the Three Officers getting in, which were believ'd to be con&s;iderable Per&s;ons. This day we had a De&s;erter from the Town, who was a <HI>Lorrainer</HI> by Birth, who confirm'd the relation which the others had given, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Enemy had re&s;olv'd to defend them&s;elves to the la&s;t extremi|ty; that they had made divers Mines, which are all di&s;cover'd; that they wanted nothing; that Wine was brought in abundance to the
<PB N="10" REF="8">Souldiers, even on the Ramparts; that there were always Six Batta|lions on the Guard. It has been concluded at the Electoral Attack, that every day, 3500 Men &s;hall &s;erve in the Trenches, of which his E|lectoral Highne&s;s of <HI>Saxony</HI> furni&s;hes a little more than the three fifth parts. At the <HI>Lorrainers</HI> Attack, 4000 ought to be there every day, which is regulated in this manner, That the Imperiali&s;ts &s;hall furni&s;h every third day 5000 Men, the <HI>Lunenburgers</HI> 4000, and the <HI>He&s;&s;ians</HI> 3000, of which, tho&s;e that are de&s;ign'd for the <HI>Lorrainers</HI> Attack, incamp already on this &s;ide the <HI>Rhine.</HI> The greate&s;t part of the Ge|nerals believe that the great Battery will not be ready in 8 days time yet. A <HI>French</HI> Party, of about 400 Foot, has been &s;een not far from <HI>Bingen;</HI> it is thought that they &s;eek to po&s;t them&s;elves in the Neighbourhood, to incommode our Forragers.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 23. We advanc'd but little that day, by rea&s;on of a great Rain. At the Elector's Attack the Trenches were carried on a little, and the Trevaux were more &s;ecur'd: Some Lines al&s;o were carried on at the Attack of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> on the Right and Left, to give a larger Front, they work al&s;o on the Battery and on the Ditch; we had in the Lines one killed and three wounded, and at the Battery two killed and five wounded.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 24. Two <HI>French</HI> Officers were kill'd out of the Camp, that de&s;igned to get into the Town; Five more were pur&s;ued, but could not be taken; a Party of the Enemies, of 300 Men on Hor&s;e-back, were &s;een on <HI>Creutzenach</HI>-Road. A Citizen who had been &s;ent by the Governour of the Town with Letters to the Mar&s;hal of <HI>Duras,</HI> brought them to the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> the mo&s;t &s;ecret Letters were writ in Characters, conceal'd in a Bra&s;s Button which button'd up his Breeches, their Contents are not yet known, there being no body found in the Army that can unravel them. This Night, at the Electo|ral Attack, the Trenches were carried on towards the Left of the Ci|tadel with very little lo&s;s; two &s;mall Pieces were mounted al&s;o, with which the Enemies Hor&s;e-Guard was gall'd, which upon that retir'd into the Town. The Enemy did Palli&s;ado the &s;mall Works, and tho&s;e Ditches which they had in the <HI>Stadian</HI> Garden. At the <HI>Lorrainers</HI> Attack, a Line was drawn on the Right, round the Works, and there was much labouring about the great Battery al&s;o. The Let|ters which have been found on the above-mentioned Citizen, con|tain an Advice from the Marque&s;s of <HI>&V;xelles</HI> to the Mar&s;hal <HI>Duras,</HI> That the Garri&s;on is compos'd but of 6000 Men, among&s;t which are numbred above 1800 &s;ick and wounded, and that the re&s;t are ex|treamly fatigated, re&s;ting neither Night nor Day, &s;o that he &s;hall be
<PB N="11" REF="8">forc'd to &s;urrender the place to the <HI>Germans</HI> if he is not &s;peedily reliev'd; de&s;iring, after that, the Mar&s;hal <HI>Duras,</HI> to let him know with the &s;oone&s;t the Kings plea&s;ure, on that &s;ubject.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 25. Another Line was traced on the Left, we al&s;o work'd very hard at the <HI>Lorrainers</HI> Battery.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 26 Fifteen large Cannon were plac'd on the <HI>Lorrainers</HI> Battery, and the &s;aid Battery was &s;ecur'd with Two Lines newly drawn.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 28. Ten Pieces more were placed on the &s;ame Battery, very large, as al&s;o proportionably of Amunition. The Pieces were plac'd in the Embracements, and a new Redoubt was traced out on the Right 60 paces di&s;tant from the Foot of the Glacis. Thirty Barrels of Powder have been drawn out of two Mines, which have been di&s;co|ver'd near the great Battery of the Imperiali&s;ts, by the means of a <HI>French</HI> Miner who made his e&s;cape out of the place to come to us. Our Army was a little le&s;&s;en'd, by a Detatchment of 6000 Hor&s;e, which were &s;ent towards <HI>Heidelberg,</HI> under General <HI>Dunewald</HI>'s Com|mand. This Day Mar&s;hal <HI>Duras</HI> came before <HI>Heidelberg</HI> with 1500 Men, and at Night they A&s;&s;aulted the Town, and enter'd the Sub|urbs, endeavouring to Po&s;t them&s;elves in the new Church of St. <HI>Ja|cob,</HI> but they were vigorou&s;ly repul&s;ed with the lo&s;s of 350 Men.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 29. From the <HI>Lorrainers</HI> Attack, we began to beat the Coun|ter&s;carp, and in a &s;hort time the Cannon was di&s;mounted, the Em|bracements were &s;o ruin'd that the Enemy were forc'd to take in the &s;aid Pieces on the Neighbouring Ba&s;tion, on the Right, whence they fire at this pre&s;ent with 4 Cannons. This Night we laboured hard on the new Redoubt, and a new Line was traced on the Left, the better to get into the Ditch, near the Gate.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 30. They fired extreamly at the <HI>Lorrainers</HI> Battery this Morn|ing, and by that means, the Enemy were forc'd to remove further off their Pieces. They made good u&s;e of their time however, and after that ours had made their di&s;charge, they fired hard from the Ba&s;tion on the Right Hand, on our Battery, and our Approaches. This Night the great Redoubt was put in a good condition on the left, on which the Enemy Sallied about 60 &s;trong, but were &s;oon repul&s;ed with the lo&s;s of 9 Men, among&s;t which was an Officer, we reckon'd al&s;o that Night upon many kill'd and wounded. Our Miners began this Night their Counter-mines, two able <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Engineers were that Night kill'd.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 31. We fired not &s;o hard from the <HI>Lorrain</HI>'s Battery as we had done the two precedent Days, becau&s;e of the heat; on the con|trary,
<PB N="12" REF="9">the Enemy fired more than before. There was no great firing that Night on either &s;ide with the Cannon, but the &s;mall Shot was the more fierce on the <HI>Electoral</HI> Attack, while they were taking a new Po&s;t. We lo&s;t divers of our Men in that Action, who be|hav'd them&s;elves bravely. Count <HI>Reu&s;s,</HI> Major <HI>Sweinitz,</HI> and Captain <HI>Altback,</HI> were wounded. A Dragoon of the Regiment <HI>Laude,</HI> who &s;urrender'd him&s;elf that Day, told us that the Ground of the Glacis was fill'd with Bombs, cover'd over with Boards, with long Nails, who&s;e points were hid with earth, and that all the angles of the Counter&s;carp were undermin'd.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1. Two Towers that were &s;ituated on the le&s;t were beaten with our Cannon from the Battery of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> all the Day long, not without Succe&s;s. The Enemy did al&s;o fire his Cannon-on us from the Works. This Night tho&s;e of <HI>He&s;&s;e</HI> flung into the Town from beyond the <HI>Rhine</HI> divers Bombs. The Enemy did al&s;o make a vigorous Sally on the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Approaches, but were repul&s;ed by the <HI>Lunen|burgers,</HI> who were that Night on the Guard; we lo&s;t above 100 Men in this Action. The Enemy drew a Line al&s;o of Communication to the Glacis. We likewi&s;e did draw a great Parallel from the Re|doubt on the Left to that on the Right.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 2. The Cannon began to play again from the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Bat|tery by break of Day, on the Works both on the Right and Left, which was continued till Night with good &s;ucce&s;s; there was al&s;o &s;lung from Seven Morter-pieces divers Bombs into the Coun|ter&s;carp. About Noon our Cannon had beaten down the Roof and the be&s;t part of the top of the round Tower, which is on the Left of the Cathedral, whence our Men had received great damage. The &s;quare Tower near St. <HI>Stephen</HI>'s Church, a little higher than the round Tower, was for the mo&s;t part ruin'd al&s;o. The Ramparts and Works on the Right were al&s;o endamag'd. We could plainly &s;ee the Enemy work on the Rampart, &s;o &s;oon as we had di&s;charg'd our Cannon, and that they began to entrench them&s;elves there. The Parallel-Line was this Night fini&s;hed, and tho&s;e of <HI>He&s;&s;e</HI> mounted Six Pieces more of 24 Pound Buliet; there was nothing el&s;e remark|able that pa&s;s'd: Neither did the Enemy fire but their Muskets and &s;mall Pieces; ours did ca&s;t &s;ome Bombs and Carca&s;&s;es into the Town, &s;o did tho&s;e of <HI>He&s;&s;e</HI> from beyond the <HI>Rhine,</HI> which ca&s;t divers Bombs in the Enemies out-works. We had that Night Five killed and Twelve wounded on our &s;ide.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 3. The Cannon play'd from the Battery of <HI>Lorrain</HI> that Day, on the great Tower near the Gate <HI>Gais,</HI> and on the Three
<PB N="13" REF="9">Ba&s;tions, St. <HI>Alexander,</HI> St. <HI>Boniface,</HI> and St. <HI>Martin,</HI> to make a breach, but we fired not &s;o fiercely as the Day before. The Enemy fired very vigorou&s;ly all that Day with their Muskets, and killed and wounded divers of our Men; they al&s;o &s;hot &s;ome Vollies of Cannon in|to the Camp, and towards the Approaches, but with no effect. This Night ours encompa&s;s'd the Redoubt on the Left with Palli&s;adoes, and fini&s;hed the Ditch before the Battery. The Cannon this Night was more quiet on both &s;ides, but the Enemy fired continually their Muskets, we al&s;o ca&s;t &s;ome Bombs into the Town. Colonel <HI>Erfa</HI> was wounded in the right arm by a piece of our Shells.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 4. We continu'd this Day as we had done ye&s;terday in bat|tering the three fore&s;aid Ba&s;tions, and the great Tower near to the Gate <HI>Gau,</HI> but not very much; we had Two De&s;erters, who told us that the Enemies were carrying on a Mine towards the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Battery. This Night a great Parallel Line was drawn towards the Glacis. From the Imperial Attack we ca&s;t all this Night long a great number of Bombs into the Town, to di&s;turb the Ene|my in their labours, there was al&s;o &s;mart firing of &s;mall &s;hot on both &s;ides, for all that the <HI>Lunenburgers</HI> that were that Night on the Guard in the Trenches had but one killed and Ten wounded.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 5. We began again early in the Morning to batter from the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Battery the three Ba&s;tions and the above-mention'd Tower, which was continu'd all Day till Night. The <HI>French</HI> began about Noon to play off their great Cannon on our Batteries and Ap|proaches, from a little Fort, which draws near to the top of the Ca&s;tle, they ca&s;t al&s;o divers Bombs, by which we had above Forty dead and wounded. We al&s;o did ca&s;t, not only all Day but all Night al&s;o, Bombs on the Fort, and all other places where there was any pro&s;pect of indamaging the Enemies Works. The &s;mall &s;hot was al&s;o increas'd this Day on both &s;ides more than ever. A certain De|&s;erter from the Town, &s;aid that the Enemy had fini&s;h'd the Mine, which they had began to conduct towards our Trench and Battery, and that they were ready to &s;tore it with Powder. Moreover, at the Imperial Attack have been brought to perfection the Two new Lines, which are about 25 Paces from the Glacis. This Night has been trac'd the great Battery at the Electoral Attack, which contains 887 Paces in its Circumference, and which is to be mounted with 36 Pieces of large Bores. This Battery is made with two inward Angles, in that place which is advanc'd before the la&s;t place of Arms. The middle of the Battery beats on the Ravelin of the Citadel; our Cannon is to batter in Flank and Front the Enemies
<PB N="14" REF="10">Defences, which an&s;wer to our Attack; after having perfected a Line of Traver&s;e, with double Ba&s;tions to cover our Left Flank, we began to open a Ditch and to rai&s;e higher the Battery. The de&s;ign of it con&s;i&s;ts of 12 Foot thick near the Ditch, 6 at the Berne, 25 at the Platform, and 15 behind.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 6. We began again early in the Morning to Fire our Can|non, and to ca&s;t Bombs from the Imperial Attack, where the Two Generals, <HI>Souches</HI> and <HI>Wallis,</HI> with the Prince of <HI>Saxen Wei&s;&s;enfels,</HI> this Day Commanding, the Enemy have done the &s;ame. They made two vigorous Sallies betwixt Twelve and One, under the favour of a great Rain, with 300 Hor&s;e and 1500 Foot; they &s;lided along from both the Gates of <HI>Altmun&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Gau</HI> towards our Men, Attacking the fir&s;t Line with great fury, of which they ea&s;ily made them&s;elves Ma|&s;ters, it being not yet in po&s;ture of Defence, nor Lin'd with Small &s;hot. Our Men that were in the more remote Lines were diligent, got out of the Trenches on the Right and Left, and vigorou&s;ly drove back the Enemy after a large half hours Combat, with great lo&s;s; &s;o that for the mo&s;t part they ran away on their Feet and Hands, what was found of the Enemy at the head of the Trenches were pre&s;ently cut to pieces, the Soldiers Rage going &s;o far, that they &s;et &s;ome Heads that had been cut off on Spikes before the Camp, and cut Leather Thongs out of the Skins of their Backs; which was afterwards for|bidden by his Highne&s;s the Duke of <HI>Lorraine;</HI> there was great Firing on both &s;ides of Cannons and Bombs during the Combate. The num|ber of killed and wounded on our &s;ide amounts to 300 Men, among&s;t the Dead are the Aid General and Major of the Granadeers, the Baron <HI>Bre&s;&s;ee,</HI> who was &s;ent &s;ome time &s;ince to his Electoral Highne&s;s of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> Captain <HI>Sicking</HI> Canon of <HI>Mentz,</HI> as al&s;o <HI>Lunati</HI> Captain of the Granadeers. After this Combat, &s;ome of the Enemies wounded Officers that had remain'd on the place, ask'd for Quarter from our Men. His Highne&s;s the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> having been inform'd that the ground from the head of the Trenches to the top of the Glacis was cover'd with a great number of <HI>French</HI> Bodies Dead and Dying; the la&s;t of which made &s;uch Cryes and Lamentations as mov'd Compa&s;&s;ion. His Highne&s;s the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> &s;ent a Drummer to the <HI>French</HI> at <HI>Mentz,</HI> but they laught at it, asking whether we had not &s;omething el&s;e to de&s;ire? which oblig'd our Musketeers to di&s;patch the wounded Officers. The Governour did this out of fear, that the &s;ight of &s;o many Dead and wounded &s;hould imprint &s;ome coldne&s;s on the re&s;t of the Garri&s;on; wherefore he thought it not fit to Corre&s;pond to the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI>'s Humanity, chu&s;ing rather to leave his Wounded
<PB N="15" REF="10">and Dying Men among&s;t the Dead without help, than to &s;hew &s;o &s;ad a Spectacle to the Garri&s;on and Towns-men. But through a Chri&s;tian Charity, all tho&s;e that have been found to the very foot of the Glacis have been taken up and Buried. The number of the Dead and woun|ded of the Enemy ought to amount to 500 per&s;ons, according to the De&s;erters reports, and the Li&s;t which they have brought to us thereof. Among&s;t the fir&s;t is &s;aid to be a certain Lieutenant Colonel who was highly con&s;ider'd among&s;t them, and divers other Officers of the Fir&s;t Rank. There was but little firing this Night on either &s;ide, only ours did ca&s;t Bombs into the Town. After this the Enemy made &s;ome &s;hew of Sallying forth again, as they did effectively, with but few Men, out of the Counter&s;carp, doubtle&s;s with a de&s;ign to carry away the Dead and Wounded which they found in great numbers heap'd up to|gether round the Palli&s;ado's, but they were again repuls'd with the lo&s;s of &s;ome kill'd and wounded. Some of our Musketeers going out of the Trenches by &s;tealth to &s;trip &s;ome of the Dead remaining on the place, were made Pri&s;oners by the Enemy. There has been digg'd up at the <HI>Electoral</HI> Attack, on the Right of the fir&s;t Redoubt a large Well, whence a Gallery is to be advanc'd under ground, both to work about &s;ome Mines, and to give vent to tho&s;e which the Enemy may have made under the <HI>Glacis.</HI> The Ditch of the Battery has been advanc'd &s;ome paces this Night, but in the Morning it was found that they had di&s;tanc'd them&s;elves too far from the Right Line, and that con&s;equently that work was expos'd to the Enemy, becau&s;e it might be man'd by them from their Defences.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 7. This Day was but &s;mall Firing; on either Side, which has happen'd on our &s;ide, becau&s;e that we were bu&s;ie in Rai&s;ing a New Battery, yet the Enemy Fired continually with their Small Shot all Night, and we ca&s;t divers Bombs into the Town. The <HI>Lunenburgers</HI> who were this Night in the Trenches lo&s;t &s;ome Officers, and private Centries. Some of the Enemies were made Pri&s;oners, that were endeavouring to carry off &s;ome of their Dead. A new Line has been drawn on the left of the Imperial Attack; we have labour'd Day and Night about the new Battery; at the Electoral Attack, the Wells have been made deeper which were made for the Mines, conveying out of them the Water which was in them.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 8. This day no more than ye&s;terday has there been but little Firing on both &s;ides, the Rea&s;ons on our &s;ide were, that the Batteries and the Mines were not yet brought to perfection. A De&s;erter who came this day to us confirms the great lo&s;s that the Enemy has &s;u|&s;tain'd in the Sally which they made the 6th. pa&s;s'd: He has al&s;o di&s;|cover'd
<PB N="16" REF="11">to us all the Mines of the Enemy, and to what places they had been Conducted. This Night another Redoubt and Battery has been rais'd at the head of the Gallows, and a Line has al&s;o been drawn; we ca&s;t all night long Bombs and Carca&s;&s;es into the Town. On the contrary, the Enemy Fired fiercely their &s;mall &s;hot from the Ramparts and the Counter&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">arp. They al&s;o made a &s;mall Sally on the Imperiali&s;ts, who &s;oon forc'd them to Retreat with the lo&s;s of 20 Men, though of our &s;ide we had not a few kill'd and wounded that Night. His Electoral Highne&s;s of <HI>Bavaria</HI> pa&s;s'd all the Night long in the Trenches, and has caus'd a great Redoubt to be trac'd in a certain place which is very convenient to cover and defend that Battery which has been nam'd St. <HI>Emanuel,</HI> and which is to be of 50 Paces in length on two &s;ides; the Work of the Battery has been carried on al&s;o, and there has been rais'd at the left of the Trench a Traver&s;e, behind which the Guard of Hor&s;e of the Electo|ral Attack is to be Po&s;ted.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 9. This Day our Cannon play'd &s;martly all along, principally on the Tower of the Gate <HI>Gau,</HI> and in the Night divers Bombs were ca&s;t into the Town. The Enemy did likewi&s;e continually fire with their &s;mall &s;hot all the Night long, and ca&s;t al&s;o &s;ome Bombs into our Camp. We labour'd hard to &s;et in defence the newly erected Battery; the Lines on the Right of the Gibbet were fini&s;hed al&s;o, and new Lines were carried on towards the Glacis of the right and left. We conti|nued at the Electoral Attack to work on the Battery and Redoubt be|fore mention'd, and on the Lines of Communication al&s;o.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14th. The&s;e Days there pa&s;s'd no great Matters on either &s;ide; We at the Imperial Attack joyn'd the Lines that were newly rais'd, we al&s;o made &s;ome Embraces for 8 Pieces on the New Battery, 6 of which are to batter the Enemies Ba&s;tions, and batter in flank that Work which the Enemy newly rais'd near to the Gibbet. There was a Well al&s;o made, a little more advanc'd than the Fir&s;t, and by that means we have carried on our Work to the Palli&s;a|does of the Counter&s;carp, where we happily have di&s;covered &s;ome of the Enemies Mines; all that Work has co&s;t us but very few Men, no more than to the <HI>Lunenburgers</HI> who lo&s;t not 10 Men, though that on the 13th at Night when they did Duty in the Trenches, they for|warded much their work by Sapping: The 14th at Night the Great Tower near the Gate <HI>Gan</HI> was beaten down with the Cannon from our New Battery. Divers De&s;erters are come into our Camp, but on the other hand, divers of ours, above all, of the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI>'s Guards, and divers <HI>French</HI> went over to the Enemy. On the 10th the above-mention'd Work was continu'd at the Electoral Attack. This

The 11th the St. <HI>Emanuel</HI>'s Redoubt was fini&s;h'd, the Ditch was al&s;o advanc'd, and we began to rai&s;e the <HI>Parrapet</HI> higher, and to make Platforms, the Miner being already got far under ground, has advanc'd &s;ome paces under the <HI>Glacis.</HI> Two Ma&s;ters of Fire works being got to us from the Town, Confirm'd that the number of kill'd and wounded encrea&s;es much, that the Garri&s;on was much decreas'd, and that the Governour expre&s;s'd a great impatiency for Succour.

The 13th We advanc'd with the Ditch and the Parrapet through the&s;e La|bourers means to that place of the Battery which had been de&s;ign'd; The Right Flank of it was covered with a treble row of Gabions a|gain&s;t the I&s;land which the Enemy &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es on the other &s;ide of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and we have drawn from the &s;aid Flank a Line of Communica|tion, which joyns the Redoubt call'd St. <HI>Margarets.</HI> The 14th There was made on the Right of the Battery 18 Embraces; we al&s;o de&s;ign'd to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">nk the Ditch 14 Foot deeper, and to Rai&s;e the Battery by 12.

<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 15. Prince <HI>Veldents</HI> was greatly wounded after Dinner with a Musket &s;hot. We continu'd at the Electoral Attack to Rai&s;e the Battery and to make more Embracings, the work of the la&s;t has been carried on to 40 Paces on each &s;ide, &s;o that on the Right it is advan|ced to the <HI>Glacis.</HI> At the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack we have not only begun this Night to draw the Parallel Line, but to Rai&s;e a new Battery al&s;o, which co&s;t them 40 Men killed and wounded. The Cannon of the Great <HI>Lor|rain</HI> Battery play'd not &s;o &s;iercely as before, that we may work with more &s;ecurity in the Mines; yet have they with their &s;mall Battery Di&s;mounted the Enemies two Cannons which they had planted on the Gibbet, of which great part has been beaten down, and by that means caus'd the Enemies Hor&s;e, that had po&s;ted them&s;elves there, to Di&s;lodge. Some <HI>French</HI> De&s;erters, among which is found a Hor&s;e|man, who &s;ay that the Governour having had Advite that the la&s;t night our Men would attempt an A&s;&s;ault on the Counter&s;carp, he had Commanded thither all the Granadeers with 4 Men of each Company, and that he had caus'd to be carried thither 500 Granadoes, but that they had been Fired about Eleven at Night by one of our Bombs which had fallen there, and had made &s;uch a havock that all flew into the Air. The &s;ame De&s;erters add, that there are above 4000 reckon'd to be Wounded and Sick in the Town, and that the Governour had Orders to hold out to this Day, but that afterwards he was to attempt a good Capituiation; that upon that the Governour had forbid any more Firing of the Cannon, nor ca&s;ting of Bombs without particular Orders: wherefore for this Rea&s;on they of the Town had not Fired above 10 Cannon-&s;hot a day, nor ca&s;t above 8 Bombs in 8 Days time; above all, to kill no Dog neither within nor without the Town: the Rea&s;on was, that they believ'd that a <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Woman came in and out frequently under the &s;hape of a Dog.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 16 La&s;t Night about 8 of the Clock the Enemies Cannon began to play very hard, which has been continu'd to this Morning. A certain De&s;erter who came this day to us, Confirms that there are a great number of Officers and Common Centries wounded in the Town, that our Bombs and Carca&s;&s;es did a world of damage <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters"> the Enemies Defences, e&s;pecially in the cover'd way, and t hat the Coun|ter&s;carp had been reinforc'd with M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">, &s;earing every moment an A&s;|&s;ault.

<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 17. This Day divers De&s;erters came into the Camp from the Town, who according to the others Relations confirm, that the continual Labour they were put to had forc'd them to do &s;o, That the Governour did ince&s;&s;antly Encourage the Garri&s;on to a vigorous De&s;ence; a&s;&s;uring them that he would defend him&s;elf to the la&s;t extremity. That there had been a noi&s;e in the Town, that the Ar|tillery of the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack was removing to the Electoral Attack, becau&s;e that we were not &s;ufficiently provided with great Cannon to batter the Town. That be&s;ides, it had been &s;pread about in the Town to put a &s;tap to the Souldiers De&s;ertion; That the De&s;erters were very ill treated in the Camp, &s;o far as to refu&s;e them Bread for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; That they were rifled and ill treated, and that they even put to death in the Camp all Per&s;ons that &s;urrendred them|&s;elves there, and that not one could yet get a free Pa&s;&s;age, nor avoid the Be&s;iegers fury. Upon this Report Major General <HI>Werner</HI> was commanded to cau&s;e all the Cannon of the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Battery to fire at the &s;ame time that tho&s;e of the Electoral Attack &s;hould be di&s;|charged. The Sereni&s;&s;ime Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> having been inform'd of the fal&s;e Rumours which the French Officers did &s;pread abroad to affrighten the Souldiers, thought fit to undeceive them of that fal&s;e impre&s;&s;ion; cau&s;ing divers Bills to be writ, which were by an inven|tion &s;hot into the Town, which contain, that all De&s;erters were to expect a kind Treatment, and like unto that which was us'd towards tho&s;e who had already pa&s;s'd into the Camp, a&s;&s;uring them, that far from ill treating tho&s;e that would retire, a free Pa&s;&s;age was gi|ven them, and wherewith to go forwards under good Pa&s;&s;es. <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">|&s;ter,</HI> Colonel of the Dragoons of the Troops of the <HI>Wic.

This night 16 Pieces more of Cannon of large bore have been mounted at the Electoral Attack on the great Battery, opening at the &s;ame time the Embra&s;ings. The Work at the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack has not been advanc'd any further, 15 Souldiers were killed, and 23 wounded.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 18. We began at &s;ix this morning to batter with 36 Pieces of Cannon from the Electoral's great Battery, the high De|fences of the Town and Citandel, in the pre&s;ence of his Electoral Highne&s;s of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> and of many other Generals, and divers Bombs have been al&s;o ca&s;t into it; which has obliged the Enemy to draw back their Cannon. This was immediately followed at the <HI>Lorrain</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="13">Battery by the Di&s;charge of 48 Pieces of Cannon, and of 12 Mortar|pieces, which were repeated divers times, to let the Enemy know we wanted no Artillery. We had begun the night before to fire fu|riou&s;ly from the &s;ame Attack, and to ca&s;t a great number of Bombs and Carca&s;&s;es into the City. The De&s;erters who came in to day relate, that they &s;aw &s;ome of the Bills that had been &s;hot into the City; that the hopes of a good Treatment, which was promis'd to them in it, had made them take this Re&s;olution of coming, and that divers others would follow their Examples. There was drawn this night at the Electoral Attack the Parallel Lines of Comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">nica|tion from the two la&s;t Redoubts to the Battery, where we have be|gun to make a new place of Arms. The Works are advanced a|long the <HI>Glacis</HI> at the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack. And whereas the Enemy have &s;et up a Row of Palli&s;ado's behind the Patrapet of the Counter|&s;carp, and that they have gathered together a great heap of Sythes and of other In&s;truments on the left of the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Trenches, on the apprehen&s;ion that the Be&s;ieged had that we &s;hould attack the covert way; it has been thought fit to leave there that Battalion which was there in re&s;erve this day. In the mean time our Miners are day and night bu&s;ied in di&s;covering the Enemies Furnaces, and to make &s;ome in tho&s;e places where we de&s;ign'd to open. There was this day nine killed, and 21 wounded in the Works. This day about Noon we learnt, that the French had made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of <HI>Cocheim,</HI> where they had made about 600 Pri&s;oners of War, being the 15th of this month, St. <HI>Lewis</HI> his Day, after that the Be&s;ieged had &s;u&s;tained the fourth A&s;&s;ault.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 19. They continued this day to fire all their Cannon from the two Attacks to ruine the Enemy's Defences, which was not with|out effect. They rai&s;ed a little Fort at the Electoral Attack from the other &s;ide of the Bridge, a little higher than the I&s;land: They began al&s;o that night to rai&s;e another Battery, the Work of which co&s;t us many mens lives, and &s;everal wounded. The Count of <HI>Reus,</HI> Major General of the <HI>Saxons,</HI> found a great many wounded, and Captain <HI>Wedel</HI> with a Lieutenant, and divers others killed. They made Platforms at the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack near to all the Regiments, who were be fore the Front of the Lines of Circumvallation, to plant their Field-pieces there, and to hinder by that the Surpri&s;e of the Ene|mies, who, according to the News that was &s;pread, ought to be on their March to relieve the City. This day we met with two De&s;er|ters, who yet could give no intelligence, but that the Enemy had re|lieved the Guard of Hor&s;e, who till this pre&s;ent time, had been po&s;t|ed
<PB N="21" REF="13">at the Gallows, becau&s;e they had received very great Damage from the Redoubt which was on the left &s;ide of the Trenches of <HI>Lor|rain,</HI> that they could not advance any further on the Work. The Enemy had that night &s;prung a Mine at the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack, which had no great effect, but only that it had ruined &s;ome paces of the Gallery which did lead to our Mine, burying two men with it who were found there, and &s;prung al&s;o a Furnace on our left &s;ide under our Gallery nigh 18 feet, making two of our Mines u&s;ele&s;s, yet that did not hinder to carry on our Works, nor kept us from working at four places of the Sap. Another De&s;erter came to the Camp, who did us better Service than the other two: ob&s;erving that one had brought a Pea&s;ant to &s;peak to an Officer of the Guard before the Tent of his Highne&s;s the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> he di&s;covered that he was a man who carried all the Intelligence from without into the place; and that he carried it back to the Mare&s;hal <HI>Duras</HI> and others, all that was fit to be known. He was pre&s;ently &s;eized, and they found that he had &s;ome Letters about him writ in Cyphers: and having con|fe&s;s'd his Crime, there was a Report, that he &s;hould be empaled a|live, after the <HI>Hungarian</HI> manner; to be made an Example to tho&s;e who &s;hould dare to undertake &s;o dangerous an Enterpri&s;e. There will be to morrow 104 pieces of Cannon mounted on the Battery a|gain&s;t the City be&s;ides Mortar Pieces.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 20. The la&s;t night the <HI>Saxons</HI> began to rai&s;e a new Battery, to mount there 12 Cartouches, which they had received from their own Country.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 21. A De&s;erter reported to the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and to the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> that there was great plenty in the Garri|&s;on, and that there was there 5000 fighting men. The <HI>Bavarians</HI> di&s;charged five new Pieces of Cannon upon the Counter&s;carp. The &s;ame day the Enemy &s;prung a Mine on the &s;ide of the <HI>Lunenberg</HI> At|tack, but it had very little effect, having bur&s;t on the &s;ide, becau&s;e the Allies had countermined it. An hour after they &s;ent &s;ome Mi|ners to &s;ind it out there, but they were forced to retire, being half dead, by rea&s;on of a horrible Smoak that came from it. The French had began another Mine on the left &s;ide, but we hoped that that which we had made very near it, would be ready to &s;pring before theirs. The <HI>Saxons</HI> took a new Po&s;t near to the Counter&s;carp, but yet they &s;uffered a great lo&s;s, having had at that time many men kil|led and wounded. <HI>Adjutant Rothkirk</HI> was of the number of the fir&s;t. A Lieutenant in the Regiment of <HI>Schomberg</HI> was dangerou&s;ly hurt in his Body; with many others, as Colonel <HI>Scot,</HI> who was mortally wounded in the Trenches.</P>

<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 22. They continued this Day to fire their Cannon at the Gar|ri&s;on, and we wrought all night at the great Parallel Line, but we did not advance very much, by rea&s;on of the Rocks that hindred us. The Imperiali&s;ts and the <HI>He&s;&s;ians</HI> wrought all night at the Sap, they took their Po&s;t 20 paces from the Palli&s;ade on the left &s;ide; and they maintained their Ground in de&s;pight of the cortinual firing of the Mu&s;queteers and Granadeers of the Be&s;ieged, and from the great quantity of Stones that were &s;hot from their Mortars; yet very &s;ew of the Souldiers were killed or wounded. They made again another great Sally, and the Prince of <HI>Commercy</HI> was re&s;olved to oppo&s;e it with his cu&s;tomary Force, and &s;ucceeded; who put him&s;elf at the Head of his Granadeers, and beat them back, after they had made their fir&s;t &s;hot, even into their covert way. He had on that occa&s;ion, which was very hot, four Hor&s;es killed under him, and the fifth wound|ed. His Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, his Adjutant General, and Baron <HI>Charles D'O&s;ter&s;tein,</HI> who followed the Prince, had al&s;o every one their Hor&s;es killed under them. One of his Trumpetters and one of his Grooms were killed with their Hor&s;es; yet that did not hin|der, but the Prince failed not to make two Lodgments in the open|ings of the <HI>Glacis,</HI> which the Furnaces had done, and they maintained them&s;elves there, tho' the Be&s;ieged made their greate&s;t Efforts, to force them out. We lo&s;t 100 men on this occa&s;ion, and the Enemy &s;uffered little le&s;s in number. And as the great Officers mount the Trenches, as well as the Souldiers, Prince <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> of <HI>Sax-Hall</HI> was there al&s;o killed. To congratulate the Victory that Prince <HI>Waldeck</HI> had gained of Mare&s;hal <HI>d'Humiers,</HI> we this day di&s;charged all our Cannon four times.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 23. The <HI>Lunenbergers</HI> alone relieved the Imperiali&s;ts, and the <HI>He&s;&s;ians</HI> in their Trenches, and advanced their Works on the right &s;ide, as they had proceeded on the le&s;t the night before; &s;o that they found them&s;elves very near to the two &s;ides, and with an equal di&s;tance to the covert way. The &s;ame day we &s;eized on a Re|formade Golonel, who was &s;u&s;pected to have held Intelligence with the Governour of the Garri&s;on.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 24. Two Thou&s;and <HI>Imperiali&s;ts,</HI> and as many of the <HI>He&s;&s;e|ans,</HI> re-gained the Place of the <HI>Lunenbergers,</HI> and advanced their Works by the <HI>Sapp,</HI> within 20 Foot of the Heighth of the <HI>Glaci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> The Enemy &s;prung again Two Mines, which were very ineffectual, except that we had one Soldier killed, and two wounded.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 25. The <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> and the <HI>He&s;&s;ians</HI> got again into their Works, continued the <HI>Sapp</HI> to the very heighth of the <HI>Glacis,</HI> and
<PB N="23" REF="14">made all nece&s;&s;ary preparations to be able to open at the fir&s;t Com|mand. There was al&s;o carried on this Day the Two Branches of the Trenches which they had begun to advance towards the Two &s;ides, to encompa&s;s behind the Redoubt, which the be&s;ieged had rai&s;ed to the Heighth of the Gallows, very nigh to the Palli|&s;ade.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 26. Four Thou&s;and <HI>Lunenbergers</HI> mounted alone the Trench, after their u&s;ual manner, and advanced in the places of Arms with Faggots, and an In&s;trument to open the Ground, and with every thing that they had need to attack the Covert Way. They u&s;ed the &s;ame means at the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Attack, and the <HI>Saxon</HI> Attack, who&s;e Batteries had fired without cea&s;ing all the Days before again&s;t the Defences of the be&s;ieged, and had not only ruined them, but had al&s;o made very great Breaches in the Ramparts, which facilitated their App<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">hes: In&s;omuch, that the Trenches being al&s;o carried on above the <HI>Glacis,</HI> there was great hopes that we &s;hould carry the Covert Way in this Attack, in the &s;ame manner as the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> had done theirs, when they &s;hould come to make an A&s;&s;ault. The Elector of <HI>Saxony</HI> having received at <HI>Franck fort</HI> the &s;ad News of Duke <HI>Chri&s;ti|an</HI> of <HI>Saxe Hall,</HI> who was killed at the Approaches, and being in|formed, that the Army was advanced on all &s;ides, came back imme|diately to the Camp of <HI>Wei&s;&s;enau,</HI> where was his General Quarter, to take again the Command of his Troops which he had given him.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 27. All the Army being di&s;po&s;ed for a general Attack at the Covert Way, and the be&s;ieged having attempted in vain to di&s;lodge the Be&s;iegers from their Works, begun about Four of the Clock in the Afternoon to give an A&s;&s;ault, with all Succe&s;s that in Rea&s;on they could promi&s;e them&s;elves, by the Conduct and Experience of their Generals and their Officers, and from the Valour and Undauntedne&s;s of the Soldiers.

<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, there were embarked in &s;everal Boats which had been &s;ent from <HI>Strasburg,</HI> with Amunition for the Enemy, 6 pieces of Cannon, 2 Mortars, 2 Haubitz, and 1500 &s;ick People, where &s;ome were continually Dying, which they threw over into the <HI>Rhine.</HI> Our Lo&s;s amounted to almo&s;t 8000 Men. We may very well &s;ee that they carried away a great many things, and a va&s;t number of Goods, be&s;ides the Money they had extorted from the Neighbour|ing Countries. As the Marque&s;s of <HI>&V;xelles</HI> was going out of the Garri&s;on, he took his leave of the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> of the Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> and of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> as al&s;o of all the re&s;t of the Princes and Generals, who had been very obliging to him. And as the <HI>French</HI> are very perfidious, and that they could not relye upon their words; the Allies had re&s;erved &s;ome <HI>French</HI> Officers to re|main here as Ho&s;tages, till all the Articles of Agreement had been punctually performed. They a&s;&s;ur'd us that the <HI>French</HI> Garri&s;on did con&s;i&s;t of 11000 fighting Men before the Siege: They were con&s;train'd to &s;urrender the Place becau&s;e they wanted Powder, for there were found but 600 weight of Powder. The time of their departure out of the Garri&s;on, was from Seven a Clock in the Morn|ing till Three of the Clock in the Afternoon. After which time, the Allies took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the City. Our Bombs had done very little hurt to any of the Convents, except a Nunnery; yet there were a great many Hou&s;es who&s;e tops were pierc'd like Sives. They took out of St. <HI>Stephens</HI> Church many Cart-loads of Dead Bodies of the <HI>French,</HI> which they threw into the <HI>Rhine.</HI> There were a great number al&s;o that were not Buried, and a great many in Holes and in Convents, which lay not a foot deep in the Earth, which cau&s;ed a mo&s;t horrid &s;tinking &s;mell in all tho&s;e Places. The Ca&s;tle of the Elector, which the <HI>French</HI> had turn'd to an Ho&s;pital, was fill'd with Dead and Wounded, among which, there were many Sick, who in three days had no kind of Refre&s;hment. The Enemies had wrought Day and Night in fortifying this Garri&s;on, in the time of Nine Months that they were Ma&s;ters of it; for they were &s;o well advanced, and &s;o Regular, that there remained little or nothing to be done. But above all, the Fort that is upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> is a Piece worthy Admiration. The Pea&s;ants began to level the ways for our Approaches, and to de&s;troy the Mines. All the En|gineers who were in that Garri&s;on were either kill'd or wound|ed. And very few remain'd alive on our &s;ide.</P>
