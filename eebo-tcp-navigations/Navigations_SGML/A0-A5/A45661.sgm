<HEAD>THE DEFENCE OF THE <HI>SCOTS Settlement</HI> AT DARIEN, ANSWER'D.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN this Pamphlet came fir&s;t to my Hands, the&s;e bold and unaccountable In|&s;inuations, with which I found it &s;tuff'd up from the very beginning to the end, invited me to make &s;ome Reflections upon it, for my own Diver&s;ion, and the U&s;e of &s;ome few of tho&s;e whom I knew to be both my Friends, and con|&s;tant Adherers to the pre&s;ent Government in <HI>England;</HI> not que&s;tioning but that &s;ome more able Pen than mine would take this Task in Hand, and convince the World of the unrea&s;onablene&s;s of &s;uch an Under|taking by a private Hand, which amounts to no le&s;s than charging both His Maje&s;ty, and the pre&s;ent <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Government with Inju&s;tice, and a mi&s;take of their own Intere&s;t; as will more evidently appear out of the following Sheets.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="3">
The Dedication, which if rightly con&s;idered, is nothing el&s;e but an Introduction to the re&s;t, is to make the World believe, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;tand much indebted to the <HI>Scots,</HI> for &s;uffering them&s;elves to be united with them under one Head, and cannot di&s;charge this Obligation, unle&s;s they maintain them in their pre&s;ent Settlement of <HI>Darien,</HI> which if they don't do, they mu&s;t expect to be treated as an Un|grateful and Unju&s;t People, by the <HI>Scots,</HI> who, if we will take this Gentleman's Word for it, are power|ful enough, either by them&s;elves, or with the A&s;&s;i|&s;tance of their Allies, to reduce us to a more pliable Temper.</P>
<P>That this is the main de&s;ign of the Dedication, as well as the whole Treati&s;e, will &s;ufficiently appear to any one who will take the Pains carefully to pe|ru&s;e them; for tho' he is plea&s;ed to tell His Maje&s;ty at the beginning of the Dedication, that his De&s;ign is to vindicate the Settlement of the <HI>Scots</HI> in <HI>Darien,</HI> again&s;t the A&s;per&s;ions of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Memorial; yet, when not long after he &s;ays, That tho&s;e cannot be look'd upon as Friends to His Maje&s;ty's Dignity as King of <HI>Scots&punc;</HI> who call in que&s;tion what he en|acts in the Parliament of <HI>Scotland;</HI> I &s;ay, the&s;e Words are an undeniable Proof, that the whole is more levell'd again&s;t <HI>England</HI> than <HI>Spain.</HI> I will not pretend to make particular Reflections upon each Pa&s;&s;age here, becau&s;e I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to do it hereafter, but I cannot forbear to take notice of that unaccountable Arrogance which has emboldened &s;ome of our Modern Writers to fo&s;ter the Inventions of their own Brains, and their &s;peculative Politicks upon the World, under the Cloak of the Royal Authority: Will not Po&s;terity &s;tand amazed when they &s;ee a Per&s;on, who&s;e Faith has not only been call'd in que&s;tion, but al&s;o condemn'd by a legal Sentence, to cover his Zeal, Self-Intere&s;t, and pri|vate Pa&s;&s;ion, under the Veil of His Sacred Maje&s;ty's Name? But we will proceed to the Book it &s;elf, which begins thus.</P>

<P>It were ea&s;ie (&s;ays the Author of the Defence of the <HI>Scot</HI>'s Settlement) to make proper Remarks up|on the Weakne&s;s, In&s;olence and Ingratitude of this Memorial, but it is not worth while; all the World knows what the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> owes to His Ma|je&s;ty of <HI>Great Britain;</HI> and therefore a more civil Application might rea&s;onably have been expected to a Prince who had not only &s;av'd the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> but prevented his Catholick Maje&s;ty from being in|&s;ulted on his Throne at <HI>Madrid.</HI> But the&s;e things we pa&s;s over, and come to the chief Point in the Memorial, which is, <HI>That the</HI> Scots <HI>have po&s;ted them|&s;elves in the King of</HI> Spain<HI>'s Demains in</HI> America, <HI>con|trary to the Alliance betwixt the two Crowns.</HI> If this be prov'd to be fal&s;e, then the Cau&s;e of the great Com|plaint cea&s;es, and His Maje&s;ty of <HI>Great Britain</HI> hath rea&s;on to demand Satisfaction for the Affront offe|red thereby to his Ju&s;tice and Sovereignty.</P>

<P>It is a mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing thing to &s;ee the Author Charge one of the greate&s;t Kings in <HI>Europe,</HI> who thinks him&s;elf touch'd in the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible part of his Sovereignty, with In&s;olence and Ingratitude again&s;t His <HI>Britannick</HI> Maje&s;ty&punc; when he, who owns him&s;elf a private Per&s;on, and his Subject, u&s;es &s;o many reflecting Expre&s;&s;ions throughout the whole Treati&s;e, upon the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Government.

<HEAD>DEFENCE.</HEAD>
<P>It is Evident, (&s;ays he) That the <HI>Spaniards</HI> can|not pretend a Title to that Country by Inheritance, Marriage, or the Donation of Prince and People; and as to Conque&s;t it would be ridiculous to al|ledge it, &s;ince the <HI>Dariens</HI> are in actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their Liberty, and were never &s;ubdued, nor re|ceiv'd any <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Governour or Garri&s;on among&s;t them.

<P>We have likewi&s;e a large Account, and a full Confirmation of the War and perpetual Enmity betwixt the <HI>Dariens</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the Hi&s;tory of the Buccaneers of <HI>America, Vol.</HI> 2. <HI>Part</HI> 4. wrote by <HI>Ba&s;il Ringro&s;e,</HI> who was one of their Company. There he informs us, That the <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>Darien,</HI> and the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> are commonly at War with one another; and that the Buccaneers were invited into that Country, and join'd by the <HI>Darien</HI> Princes, Captain <HI>Andreas,</HI> Captain <HI>Antonio,</HI> and the King of <HI>Darien,</HI> who a&s;&s;i&s;ted them in the taking of <HI>Sancta Maria,</HI> and their attempt upon <HI>Panama;</HI> and the King, who&s;e Daughter the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had &s;tole away, promi&s;ed to joyn the Buccaneers with 50000 Men. This is the more remarkable, becau&s;e tho&s;e very Princes or their Succe&s;&s;ors are now in League with the <HI>Scots,</HI> and have joyfully receiv'd them into their Country. So that it is the &s;trange&s;t po&s;ition that can be put upon any Nation, and one of the mo&s;t audacious Affronts that ever was put upon &s;o Great a Prince as K. <HI>William,</HI> for the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to pretend a Right to <HI>Darien,</HI> and accu&s;e him of a Breach of the Peace, becau&s;e a Colony of his Subjects have &s;ettled them&s;elves there: when it is &s;o well known to the World, that the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> has no manner of Title to that Province.</P>
<P>Then as to any Claim by virtue of Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have not the lea&s;t ground of Plea: All they can alledge on this Head, is, That they were once admitted by the Con&s;ent of Captain <HI>Di|ego,</HI> another of the <HI>Darien</HI> Princes, to work on &s;ome Golden Mines within 15 Leagues, or there abouts, of the <HI>Scots</HI> Settlement. But it is plain that this makes nothing for their purpo&s;e. That Prince admitted them only as Labourers, but not as Proprietors; And when they broke the Condi|tions on which they were admitted, <HI>viz.</HI> To allow the <HI>Dariens</HI> &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">d &s;uch Shar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> of the Product,

they were expell'd again by force; and ever &s;ince that time, the <HI>Dariens</HI> refu&s;e to have any further Dealings with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who made them&s;elves odious to them by their Treachery and In&s;olence: So that Mr. <HI>Wafter</HI> tells us, <HI>Pag.</HI> 133.

<HEAD>ANSWER.</HEAD>
<P>Our <HI>Philo-Calydon,</HI> as he calls him&s;elf, pretends to prove here, That the <HI>Spaniards</HI> can lay no Claim to <HI>Darien</HI> as a Conque&s;t: His Rea&s;ons are; Becau&s;e they were never &s;ubdued; but I would fain ask this Gentleman, how he came to know this? 'Tis po&s;&s;ible &s;ome of his Countrymen have been told &s;o, by &s;ome of the <HI>Dariens;</HI> but this will be but a &s;lender Argument again&s;t the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> It is mo&s;t unque&s;tionable, that there is much more probability on the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;ide than on the other. For how can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who have conquer'd &s;uch a va&s;t Tract of <HI>America,</HI> and &s;everal Plantations there, &s;hould not have been able to force a few petty <HI>Indian-Lords,</HI> who are en|clo&s;ed within their Dominions, to a Submi&s;&s;ion? His Arguments, by which he would prove them a free People, is much more ridiculous, than the pre|tended Conque&s;t of the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> it being evi|dent, that a few Cottages, inhabited by a barbarous and unarmed People, headed by many Leaders, re&s;embling the Heads of <HI>Clans</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> did re|quire neither a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Governour nor Garri&s;on. What he alledges concerning the Hatred they bear to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and their joyning with the Bucca|neers again&s;t them, does not in the lea&s;t invalidate the Title of <HI>Spain</HI> to <HI>Darien;</HI> And all what <HI>Wafer, Dampier,</HI> and the Hi&s;tory of the Buccaneers, &s;ays,
<PB N="11" REF="6">
upon this Subject, proves no more, than that tho&s;e Petty <HI>Indian</HI> Lords, who formerly, either volunta|rily or by force, &s;ubmitted to the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> took this opportunity to &s;hake off the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Yoke, and to Revenge them&s;elves upon their Conquerors; For if they had been in a Condition to make War a|gain&s;t them without a foreign A&s;&s;i&s;tance, What need had there been for them to call in the Buc|caneers, and to allow them &s;o large a &s;hare in the Booty? Our <HI>Calidonian</HI> Gentleman further tells us, That the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have no other Plea for Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion, but what was granted them by one of the <HI>Darien</HI> Princes, to Work as Labourers in &s;ome Golden Mines: I mu&s;t confe&s;s this is &s;omewhat difficult to be contradicted at &s;o va&s;t a di&s;tance, and I would have pa&s;s'd by this Point in &s;ilence, if <HI>Pag.</HI> 78. he had not him&s;elf furni&s;h'd me with an Argument again&s;t his A&s;&s;ertion, where he &s;ays: <HI>That they had been informed by a</HI> Frenchman, <HI>who married one of the Natives there, That the</HI> Spaniards <HI>have Gold and Silver Mines on the</HI> I&s;thmus, <HI>which they might make them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of with a</HI> 100 M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n: This, I &s;ay, and the Ho&s;tilities committed already by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Scots</HI> in their New Set|tlement, does&punc; I think, carry with it a great pro|bability, that to this day they are not excluded from the Province of <HI>Darien,</HI> but remain in actual Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;o much of that Province, as they think con&s;i&s;tent with their own Intere&s;t. What he alledges of Captain <HI>Sharp</HI>'s being acquitted in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> by rea&s;on of his Commi&s;&s;ion from one of the <HI>Darien</HI> Princes, can in no wi&s;e affect the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Title; for, &s;uppo&s;ing the Court of <HI>England</HI> was at that time not &s;ufficiently inform'd concerning their Preten&s;ions, What detriment could that be to their real Preten&s;ions? If our Author could have given us an in&s;tance of a Per&s;on who had been acquit|ted upon the &s;ame Account in <HI>Spain,</HI> his Argu|ment would have been of unque&s;tionable Vali|dity, which bears not the lea&s;t weight now, at lea&s;t not in reference to <HI>Spain.</HI> But, let us hear

<P>It remains then that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> can lay no other Claim to <HI>Darien</HI> but what they plead <HI>from the Pope's general Grant of</HI> America, <HI>its being bounded by their Dominions, and the Treaties with</HI> England, which &s;hall be con&s;ider'd in their Order.</P>
<P>To urge the Pope's Grant among&s;t Prote&s;tants is ridiculous, and among&s;t Papi&s;ts them&s;elves but pre|carious: But admitting it were &s;ufficient to ju&s;tifie their Title, it is ea&s;ie to prove that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have forfeited all the Right they can Claim by virtue of that Grant.</P>
<P>The Church of <HI>Rome</HI> will not publickly own her Power to grant a Right of Conque&s;t, but in order to propagate the Faith, and not that neither, ex|cept the Infidel Prince or People be guilty of a Breach of Treaty.

<P>And whereas it is further Objected, That by the great Immunities and freedom from Cu&s;toms grant|ed to the <HI>Scots</HI> Company for &s;o many years, we &s;hall be able to Under Sell the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Company, fore&s;tall their Markets, and le&s;&s;en His Maje&s;ty's Cu&s;toms: We An&s;wer, That this Objection is in a great mea&s;ure obviated, &s;ince we do not now pre|tend to &s;et up an <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade; but admitting it were true, it will be to the general Advantage of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, &s;ince the Buyers are always more than the Sellers.

<HEAD>ANSWER.</HEAD>
<P>Mo&s;t People, I am apt to believe, will &s;oon agree with our Author in this point, That the <HI>French</HI> would be by far the more dangerous Neighbours to the <HI>Spa|niards</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> both in re&s;pect of their Power, and the influence they might have over the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in <HI>America</HI> upon the &s;core of their Religion; but I hope he will al&s;o grant me, that it is much more for the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t, not to be troubled with any Neigh|bours at all there, that may be in any probability to interfere with them either in Power or Traffick; but whether the <HI>Spaniards</HI> will be able, as the ca&s;e now &s;tands, to gain this point, is what mu&s;t be the pre&s;ent Object of our con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>I will for once &s;uppo&s;e the <HI>Scots</HI> to be &s;o unanimous in this matter, as our Author would have them, yet it is much to be doubted whether they would be &s;o fond of a Project that is &s;ubject to &s;o many Ca&s;ualties, and to no &s;mall danger of &s;ucceeding, as the Nobi|lity, Gentry, and others, to mortgage their E&s;tates upon that Score; but &s;uppo&s;ing they &s;hould, it would &s;till be a que&s;tion, Whether they could be in a condition to procure time enough, &s;uch a number of &s;erviceable Ships, and other Nece&s;&s;aries requi&s;ite
<PB N="40" REF="21">
for the maintaining them&s;elves at <HI>Darien</HI> even again&s;t the <HI>Spaniards</HI> alone. For, granting they &s;hould not be in a capacity to force the <HI>Scots</HI> from their Fortifi|cations, they have other means to annoy and inter|cept their Convoys, which, con&s;idering a Com|munication betwixt the <HI>Engli&s;h West-India</HI> Plantati|ons, and the <HI>Scots</HI> Settlement, is taken off, may in all likelihood reduce them to a &s;tarving condition there, or at the be&s;t put the <HI>Scots East-India</HI> Compa|ny under a nece&s;&s;ity of providing their Ships with &s;uch &s;trong Convoys, at &s;o great a di&s;tance, that the Charge may &s;urmount the Profit, notwith&s;tanding the hopes of their rich Mines.</P>
<P>What our <HI>Calidonian</HI> &s;ays of giving Commi&s;&s;ions to the Buccaneers, is little to the purpo&s;e, it being evident that they have no power &s;o to do by vertue of their Letters Patents, and that con&s;equently by &s;o doing, they mu&s;t put them&s;elves in the &s;ame range with them, which would be the ready way for them to forfeit all the Title they can pretend to upon that Settlement.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;hould put the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;o hard to it, as to be obliged to &s;eek for aid by the <HI>French,</HI> who at this juncture &s;eem to be very for|ward to purcha&s;e their good will at any rate, it is very probable that they may have their A&s;&s;i&s;tance upon much ea&s;ier terms, than the Surrender of <HI>Da|rien</HI> into their Hands; neither is it to be que&s;tioned, but that the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who are jealous of the <HI>French</HI> to the highe&s;t degree, might take &s;uch &s;ure Mea&s;ures as to the Number and other Circum&s;tances of the <HI>French</HI> Auxiliaries, as might free them from the dan|ger of being &s;urprized by them, e&s;pecially at this time, when the <HI>French</HI> are &s;o cautious of creating a Jealou&s;ie in that Nation.</P>
<P>What our Author alledges of <HI>Ceuta,</HI> is no paral|lel to this; the only rea&s;on of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> refu&s;ing the Offers of the <HI>French</HI> as to the relief of that place, being no more, than that they thought it incon&s;i|&s;tent with their Grandeur, to leave the Glory of re|lieving a place, which is &s;o near them, to a Foreign

<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have no cau&s;e to think that we were ignorant of the Rea&s;on why their Politick <HI>Henry</HI> VII. cho&s;e rather to Match his Eld<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t Daugh|ter with the King of <HI>Scots,</HI> than with the King of <HI>France,</HI> becau&s;e he fore&s;aw, that if the King of <HI>Scots</HI> &s;hould by that means come to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> he would remove the Seat of his Government thi|ther, which would add to the Grandure and Riches of <HI>England:</HI> Whereas if the King of <HI>France</HI> did by
<PB N="46" REF="24">
that means fall Heir to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Crown, he would certainly draw the Court of <HI>England</HI> to <HI>Paris.</HI> This the <HI>Scots</HI> were &s;o far from being ignorant of, that ma|ny of the Nobility and Gentry did expre&s;s their di&s;|like of the Union of the Crowns, as well knowing that it would reduce our Kingdom into a Subjection and Dependance upon <HI>England,</HI> and drain us of what Sub&s;tance we had; and therefore &s;ome of them ex|pre&s;s'd them&s;elves on that occa&s;ion, That <HI>Scotland</HI> was never Conquer'd till then: Yet &s;uch was our Zeal for the Common Welfare of the I&s;land, the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Prote&s;tant Religion,</HI> and of <HI>Europe</HI> in general, which were then almo&s;t in as much danger by <HI>Spain,</HI> as they have been &s;ince by <HI>France,</HI> that we quietly and freely parted with our King, and &s;uffer'd him to accept the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Crown, rather than that Nation &s;hould be involv'd in War and Confu&s;ion, and the <HI>Prote&s;tant Religion</HI> endanger'd by another Succe&s;&s;or, as it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have been, had the <HI>Infanta</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> who&s;e Title was then promoted by the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t, &s;ucceeded. And all the Re|ward we had for this Conde&s;cen&s;ion and Kindne&s;s, was a Contemptuous and Di&s;dainful Refu&s;al, on the part of <HI>England,</HI> of an Union of the Nations when propo&s;ed, tho' the &s;ame would vi&s;ibly have tended to the Benefit of the whole I&s;land, the general Ad|vantage of <HI>Europe,</HI> and the Security and Increa&s;e of the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Intere&s;t. And our King was &s;o little thankful on his part, that tho' he promis'd &s;olemnly in the Great Church of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> before his Depar|ture&punc; that he would vi&s;it his Ancient Kingdom once in three Years, he never &s;aw it after but once, and that not till Fourteen Years after. And by the in|fluence of that &s;ame Faction in <HI>England,</HI> who are &s;till our Enemies, he made Innovations both in Church and State. The&s;e were the fir&s;t Advantages we had by the Union of the Crowns.</P>
<P>His Son King <HI>Charles</HI> I. had &s;carce a&s;cended the Throne, when we had new Proofs of the Di&s;advan|tages we labour'd under by that Union; for he by the Advice of &s;ome Enemies to our Nation, did in

an Imperious and Arbitrary manner &s;end for our Crown, tho' the only Monument almo&s;t left us of our Independency and Freedom; but was generou&s;|ly an&s;wer'd by him that had it in keeping, That if he would come and be Crown'd in <HI>Scotland,</HI> he &s;hould have all the Honour done him that ever was to his Ance&s;tors; but if he did not think it worth his while, they might perhaps be inclin'd to make choice of another Soveraign, or to that effect; as recorded in the Continuation of Sir <HI>Richard Baker</HI>'s Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Another Di&s;advantage we had by that Union of the Crown, was this, That that Unfortunate Prince being in&s;pir'd with an Aver&s;ion to the Con&s;titution of our Country, by his Education made War upon us to bring us to a Conformity with <HI>England</HI> in Church-Matters.</P>
<P>We &s;hall not here offer to debate which of the Churches was be&s;t Con&s;tituted, or mo&s;t agreeable to the Scripture-Pattern: It &s;uffices for our Argument, That we were Injur'd in having a Foreign Model of|fer'd to be obtruded upon us, which was the Con&s;e|quence of the Union of the Crowns, and of having our King Educated in another Nation; but that was not all, another mi&s;chievous Effect of the Union was this, That whatever King <HI>Charles</HI> had de&s;erv'd at our Hands, yet out of Natural Affection, Con&s;ci|ence and Honour, we were oblig'd to do what we could to prevent his Illegal Trial and Death, and to defend his Son's Title, which threw us into Convul|&s;ions at Home, occa&s;ion'd us the lo&s;s of &s;everal Ar|mies, and expos'd our Nation afterwards to Ruine and Deva&s;tation, by our implacable Enemy the U|&s;urper, which together with the Ungrateful Retri|butions made us by the Government after the Re&s;to|ration, were enough to have wearied any Nation un|der Heav'n, but our &s;elves, of the Union of the Crowns&punc;</P>

<HEAD>DEFENCE.</HEAD>
<P>We &s;hall conclude this matter with one or two more Arguments to prove, That it is the Intere&s;t of <HI>England</HI> to joyn with us in this Affair; by which al&s;o it will appear that there is nothing advanc'd in the&s;e Sheets out of any ill De&s;ign again&s;t the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Nation, or to per&s;uade to a di&s;uniting of the Crowns; but on the contrary, that a &s;tricter Union is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that both Nations may have but one Intere&s;t, which will render us le&s;s liable to Convul&s;ions and inte&s;tine Commotions at home, and put us out of danger of being attacked by Enemies from abroad.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Argument is this; That by incouraging our Settlement at <HI>Darien, Engli&s;h</HI> Ships that have occa&s;ion to pa&s;s by tho&s;e Coa&s;ts will there be certain of a place of Retreat in ca&s;e of attack either by Enemy or Tempe&s;t, without danger of being con|fi&s;cated by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and having their Men con|demn'd to be perpetual Slaves in the Mines.</P>
<P N="2">2. If we be incouraged in our <HI>American</HI> Colony, it will contribute much to heighten the Con&s;ump|tion of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Product; &s;ince what we have not of our own, or wherein we are wanting either as to quality or quantity, we &s;hall &s;upply our &s;elves, for the u&s;e of our Plantation, in <HI>England;</HI> which may be of great benefit to the Northern Counties e&s;pecially, whence we may conveniently furni&s;h our &s;elves with Beeves for Victualling our Ships, our own Cattel being for the mo&s;t part too &s;mall for that u&s;e; be&s;ides many other things that we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to export from <HI>England</HI> for the u&s;e of the Plantation, and to maintain a Commerce with the Natives.</P>
<P N="3">3. By joining with us in this Colony, and &s;ecuring a Po&s;t on the South-Sea, which the Princes of <HI>Da|rien</HI> will no doubt very readily agree to, they may
<PB N="70" REF="36">
&s;horten their Voyages to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> and by that means be able to out-do all their Rivals in that Trade; but if they will be &s;o far wanting to them|&s;elves, as to &s;uffer tho&s;e advantages to fall into the Hands of others who are Enemies to our Religion and common Country, they cannot blame the <HI>Scots,</HI> who have made them &s;uch fair Offers.</P>
<P N="4">4. If after all, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;hould continue in their Oppo&s;ition to us, as their late Proclamations in <HI>A|merica,</HI> and other Pa&s;&s;ages would &s;eem to imply they have a mind to, the World cannot blame the <HI>Scots</HI> to provide for them&s;elves by &s;uch other Alliances as they &s;hall think meet; &s;ince the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are &s;o un|kind, e&s;pecially &s;ince the Re&s;toration of K. <HI>Charles</HI> II. to which we did &s;o much contribute, that without our Concurrence it could never have been effected. This will appear to be incontrovertibly true, if we con&s;ider that in the time of K. <HI>James</HI> I. we were under no Re&s;trictions as to matters of Trade more than they, except as to the Exportation of Wool, and a few other Things of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Product; and &s;o we con|tinu'd till the Re&s;toration, when K. <HI>Charles</HI> II. and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> did very ungratefully lay &s;uch Preclu&s;ions and Re&s;trictions upon us contrary to the Laws rela|ting to the <HI>Po&s;tnati,</HI> by the 12 <HI>Car.</HI> II. <HI>For the incou|raging and increa&s;ing Shipping and Navigation;</HI> and the 15 <HI>Car.</HI> II. <HI>For the Encouragement of Trade;</HI> by which we are put in the &s;ame Circum&s;tances as to Traffick with <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> and in a wor&s;e Condition than <HI>Ireland</HI> that is a Conque&s;t; which is &s;o much the more unrea&s;onable, &s;ince we are always involv'd and ingag'd in the Wars betwixt <HI>England</HI> and other Countries: And tho&s;e with whom they have mo&s;t frequent Wars, being <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> the only two Nations with whom the <HI>Scots</HI> have almo&s;t any Commerce, our Trade mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity &s;ink du|ring &s;uch Wars, whereas <HI>England</HI> hath &s;till a great Trade to other parts of the World; and by this means we are forc'd to be &s;harers in their Troubles, tho' they will not allow us to partake of their Profits,
<PB N="71" REF="36">
nor &s;uffer us to take any mea&s;ures to procure &s;uch as we may call our own.</P>
<P>It is plain from the In&s;tance of <HI>Darien,</HI> and the Proclamations in the <HI>Engli&s;h American</HI> Colonies a|gain&s;t their Subjects entertaining any Commerce with our Settlement there, that we are in a wor&s;e condition than ever; for when any thing happens wherein the Intere&s;t of <HI>England</HI> &s;eems to be contrary to ours, it is certainly carried again&s;t us; &s;o that in this re&s;pect we are in a wor&s;e condition than any Foreigners, with relation to <HI>England;</HI> for if a fo|reign People di&s;cover any thing that may be of Ad|vantage to them, they are at liberty to pur&s;ue it by them&s;elves, or to take in the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of others; and if they find them&s;elves aggriev'd by <HI>England,</HI> they have their re&s;pective Governments to make Application to for Redre&s;s.</P>
<P>To let them &s;ee that it is their Intere&s;t as well as ours it &s;hould be &s;o, we &s;hall only de&s;ire them to con&s;ider how fatal it may be, if by any Emergency we &s;hould be forc'd to break off the Union of the Crowns, and enter again into a <HI>French</HI> Alliance. It's in vain for them to Object, that in &s;uch a ca&s;e we &s;hould betray our Religion; for we &s;ee the per|&s;ecuted <HI>Hungarians</HI> were protected in that by the <HI>Turks,</HI> tho' &s;worn Enemies to it: Nor is it impo&s;&s;i|ble but there may be a change as to that matter in <HI>France; L.</HI> XIV. is not immortal: And even <HI>Julian</HI> the Apo&s;tate him&s;elf found it his Intere&s;t for &s;ome time to protect the Orthodox Chri&s;tians, whom he mortally hated. But &s;uppo&s;ing, (as indeed there's no great likelihood of it) that no &s;uch Alliance as this &s;hould ever happen; yet however, if the&s;e two Nations be not more clo&s;ely united, it may be of ill Con&s;equence to <HI>England</HI> if any of their Kings at any time &s;hould be &s;o far di&s;gu&s;ted as to betake them&s;elves to us: What a Field of Blood and Slaughter mu&s;t <HI>England</HI> have become, had we car|ried off K. <HI>Charles</HI> I. when he came to our Army, or i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> we had join'd him again&s;t the Parliament of <HI>Eng|land?</HI>

<P>The&s;e &s;everal Pages are no more than a Repeti|tion of what he has urged before; with this dif|ference only, that he intermixes them with &s;ome bitter and un&s;eemly Expre&s;&s;ions, which are alto|gether in&s;ufferable in a private Per&s;on and a Sub|ject. He as good as denounces War again&s;t <HI>Eng|land</HI> in ca&s;e the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;hould mi&s;carry, and &s;ounds alarm without any publick Authority.

<P>WE come next to give an Account of their Set|tlement of our Men there; how they were receiv'd by the Natives; what <HI>Indian</HI> Princes there are in their Neighbourhood; in what &s;tate they found the Affairs of the Country; and of the Situ|ation of our Colony.</P>
<P>On the 27th of <HI>October</HI> 1698. our Ships came to an Anchor in a fair &s;andy Bay, three Leagues W. off the Gulph of <HI>Darien;</HI> upon which, two Ca|noes, with &s;everal <HI>Indians</HI> came on board, were very free with our Men, told them they had been long expected, and were very welcome: Our Men gave them &s;ome old Hats, Looking gla&s;&s;es, and Knives, with which they were extremely well pleas'd, and went off. When our Ships &s;tood fur|ther into the Bay, they &s;aw about 20 <HI>Indians</HI> drawn up on the Shore, being arm'd with Bows and Lances; upon which a Boat being &s;ent a&s;hoar, and making a &s;ignal of Peace, they un&s;truug their Bows, talk'd familiarly, and told our Men, that two Great Cap|tains would in a little time come on board our Ships. Accordingly, on <HI>November</HI> the 2d, in the morning, Captain <HI>Andreas,</HI> one of their Princes, accompanied by 12 Men, came on board, and ask'd their Bu&s;i|ne&s;s:
<PB N="84" REF="43">
He was an&s;wered, That we came to live among them, and Trade with them, and would af|ford them <HI>European</HI> Commodities cheaper than any other People. He ask'd if we were Friends or Ene|mies to the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and was an&s;wered, that we were at Peace with all Men, and would make War upon no Man, except they injur'd us. He took us for Buccaneers, and told us, He knew Captain <HI>Swan</HI> and Captain <HI>Davis</HI> in the South-Sea, and com|mended them as Men of Valour. We heard that part of his Di&s;cour&s;e with much Coldne&s;s, and told him we came on no &s;uch de&s;ign as tho&s;e Men did, but had Authority for what we undertook. We treated him civilly, gave him a Hat lac'd with Gold, and &s;ome Toys: And &s;o he parted, promi&s;ing in a little time to come again; which he accordingly did, and brought <HI>Don Pedro,</HI> another of their Princes or Captains, with him. Captain <HI>Andreas</HI> was freer with us than at fir&s;t, plainly own'd that he took us for Buccaneers, and complain'd that &s;ome <HI>Eng|li&s;hmen</HI> of that &s;ort had after great pretences of Friend&s;hip, carried off &s;ome of their People; and therefore <HI>Don Pedro</HI> would not come aboard us till he had further a&s;&s;urance of us.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Andreas</HI> is a Per&s;on of a &s;mall &s;tature; he affects the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Gravity, as having been often among them at the Mines of <HI>Santa Maria, Pana|ma,</HI> &amp;c. and formerly had a Commi&s;&s;ion under them as a Captain, upon which he values him&s;elf above others: The <HI>French</HI> hate him mortally, becau&s;e of &s;omething he did again&s;t &s;ome of their Nation for|merly. When he came on board us, he had a &s;ort of a Coat of red loo&s;e Stuff, an old Hat, a pair of Drawers, but no Stockings nor Shoes; and the re&s;t that came with him were all naked, excepting their <HI>Penis,</HI> which was covered by Extingui&s;hers, as for|merly mention'd.</P>
<P>Upon further Communing, Captain <HI>Andreas</HI> was very well pleas'd with us, offered us what part of the Country we would chu&s;e, and accepted a Com|mi&s;&s;ion from us; and at the &s;ame time we gave

<P>Some of the Princes on this &s;ide the <HI>I&s;thmus</HI> had been in Peace with the <HI>Spaniards</HI> for &s;everal years, and &s;uffered a few of them to re&s;ide among&s;t them, to give notice to <HI>Panama</HI> of what Ships came upon the&s;e Coa&s;ts; but upon &s;ome fre&s;h di&s;gu&s;t, about two months before we arriv'd, Captain <HI>Ambro&s;io,</HI> who is the mo&s;t noted Prince among&s;t 'em, had ob|lig'd them to enter into a common Alliance again&s;t <HI>Spain,</HI> and cut off ten <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who liv'd upon <HI>Golden I&s;land.</HI></P>
<P>The Place where we are &s;ettled is four miles Ea&s;t of <HI>Golden I&s;land,</HI> within a great Bay. We have an excellent Harbour, &s;urrounded with high Moun|tains, capable of holding a thou&s;and Sail Land-lock'd, and &s;afe from all Winds and Tempe&s;ts. The Mouth of the Harbour is about random Cannon|&s;hot over, form'd by a <HI>Penin&s;ula</HI> on the one &s;ide, and a point of Land on the other. In the middle of the Entrance there is a Rock three foot above Water, upon which the Sea breaks mo&s;t terribly when the Wind blows hard; and within the Points there is a &s;mall Rock that lies a little under Water. On both &s;ides the&s;e Rocks there's a very good wide Channel for Ships to come in: That on the South-&s;ide is 3 Cables long, and 7 Fathom deep; and that on the North two Cables long. From the two outermo&s;t points the Harbour runs away Ea&s;t a Mile and an half; and near the middle, on the right hand, a point of Land &s;hoots out into the Bay; &s;o that by rai&s;ing Forts on the &s;aid Point, on the Rock in the middle of the Entrance, and the two outer-mo&s;t Points, it will be the &s;tronge&s;t Harbour, both by Art and Nature, that's in the known World. The Bay within is for the mo&s;t part 6 Fathom Water, and till you come within a Cable's length of the Shoar, three Fathom and an half: So that a Key may be built, to which great Ships may lay their Sides, and unload. The <HI>Penin&s;ula</HI> lies on the Left-Hand,
<PB N="86" REF="44">
is a mile and a half in length, very &s;teep, and high towards the Sea: So that it would be ve|ry difficult for any body to Land, till you come to the <HI>I&s;thmus,</HI> where there's a &s;mall &s;andy Bay that lit|tle Ships may put into, but is ea&s;ie to be &s;ecured by a Ditch and a Fort. There are &s;everal little Rivers of very good Water that fall into the Bay; and it abounds &s;o with excellent Fi&s;h, that we can with ea&s;e take more than it's po&s;&s;ible for us to de&s;troy, having &s;ometimes caught 140 at a Draught: A|mong&s;t others there be Tortoi&s;es, which are excel|lent Meat, and &s;ome of them above 600 weight.</P>

We compute our &s;elves to be a|bout 50 Leagues North of <HI>Carthagena,</HI> and as much South of <HI>Porto-Bello.</HI> The Four <HI>Indian</HI> Kings or Captains on this Coa&s;t vi&s;it us frequently in their Canoes; and the Natives are very kind to us, and &s;ell us Plaintains, Fowls &amp;c. for Toys or old Shifts.

<P>The <HI>Indian</HI> Princes or Captains on this Coa&s;t do &s;omewhat re&s;emble our Heads of Clans in <HI>Scotland;</HI> and by their Conver&s;e at times with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and other <HI>European</HI> Nations, affect Chri&s;tian Names. The fir&s;t of the&s;e Princes we &s;hall name is Captain <HI>Diego;</HI> he commands from the bottom of the Gulph of <HI>Orba</HI> on this &s;ide <HI>Caret</HI> Bay, and has 3000 Men under him; he has been at War with the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;everal years, occa&s;ion'd by an In&s;ult his People had receiv'd from them, when they came to demand their &s;hare in the Mines which they had di&s;cover'd to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in their Country, on condition of being Partners with them: But when they came to demand it, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> treated them villanou&s;ly; beat and abus'd them; upon which they attack'd the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> cut off 20 of their Men, and three Prie&s;ts that belong'd to the Mines.</P>
<P>The next is Captain <HI>Pou&s;igo.</HI> He is an <HI>Indian</HI> Clergy-man, and Brother-in-Law to Captain <HI>An|dreas.</HI> The Penin&s;ula that we po&s;&s;e&s;s, lies betwixt his Territory and that of Captain <HI>Andreas,</HI> who together with his Brother, commands from <HI>Golden I&s;land</HI> to the River <HI>Pinas.</HI> Their Command is greater than that of <HI>Pou&s;igo,</HI> but not &s;o great as that of <HI>Diego.</HI> The&s;e Princes are very u&s;eful to us, becau&s;e of their Neighbourhood and Con&s;anguinity to one another.</P>

Captain <HI>Ambro&s;io</HI> commands from the River <HI>Pinas</HI> to the <HI>Samballoes:</HI> He is a Man of about 60 years of Age, but &s;trong and vigorous, well limb'd, and of a &s;tern Countenance: He is a mortal Enemy to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> with whom he hath had a long War: He is e&s;teemed the brave&s;t of all the <HI>Indian</HI> Captains. His Son-in-Law <HI>Don Pedro</HI> having been taken by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and kept by them as a Slave at <HI>Panama,</HI> he can never forget nor forgive it them: This young Man is a great Friend to the <HI>French,</HI> who they are made to believe de&s;ign to come and &s;ettle among them. <HI>Ambro&s;io</HI> and his Son-in-Law pre&s;t us much to come and &s;ettle in their Dominions, and join with them to make War on the <HI>Spaniards:</HI> We gave them fair Words, and promis'd to come and view their Coa&s;ts, which we accordingly did; and in our way thither, four Leagues We&s;tward of our Settlement, we found an excellent Harbour, capable of 10000 Sail; but it can't be defended without many Forts: Here the Privateers us'd to come and careen. Cap|tain <HI>Ambro&s;io</HI>'s Hou&s;e lies about a League from the Water-&s;ide, on the Bank of a River, having twelve le&s;&s;er Hou&s;es about it: When we drew near it, he advanced 50 Paces to meet us, being attended by 20 Men in white loo&s;e Frocks with Fringes round the bottom, and arm'd with Lances: He &s;aluted us kindly, and gave us a Calaba&s;h of Liquor almo&s;t like Lambs-wool, made of <HI>Indian</HI> Corn and Pota|toes. His Hou&s;e is 90 foot long, 35 broad, and 30 in height, curiou&s;ly thatch'd with Palmetto-Royal, and over that Cotton-Leaves. The Floor is of firm Earth like Tarras, very &s;mooth and clean. The &s;ides are compos'd of large Canes, as thick as a Man's Leg. In this Hou&s;e live <HI>Ambro&s;io</HI> and his Son-in-Law <HI>Don Pedro,</HI> with both their Families, con&s;i&s;ting of about 40 Per&s;ons. We &s;aw <HI>Ambro&s;io</HI>'s Grandmother there, who is 120 years old, and yet was very active in getting things ready for an En|tertainment. She has &s;ix Generations de&s;cended from her now in the Hou&s;e with her. The People live here to 150 and 160 years of Age; but tho&s;e

that conver&s;e much with <HI>Europeans,</HI> and drink &s;trong Drink don't live &s;o long.</P>
<P>From the <HI>Samballoes</HI> to the River of <HI>Conception,</HI> the Country is commanded by one <HI>Corbet,</HI> who is alto|gether in the <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;t, he having contracted a Friend&s;hip with their Priveteers 7 years ago, and done them many good Offices. They promi&s;ed to reward him if he would go to <HI>Petit Guaves,</HI> and in his way thither he was taken by an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Privateer and carried to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> whence the Governor of <HI>Petit Guaves</HI> got him releas'd. He was with <HI>Ponti</HI> at the taking of <HI>Carthagena,</HI> and has a Commi&s;&s;ion from the <HI>French</HI> to be General of all the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI> Forces on that Coa&s;t, and to take, &s;ink, and de&s;troy <HI>Spaniards</HI> or any other Enemies. Yet the <HI>French</HI> them&s;elves, and the &s;en&s;ible part of the <HI>Indians,</HI> don't put any confidence in him; and <HI>Ambro&s;io,</HI> who is the brave&s;t of all tho&s;e <HI>Indian</HI> Captains, keeps him in Awe and within Bounds.</P>
<P>Next to <HI>Corbet,</HI> there's another of their Captains call'd <HI>Nicola,</HI> who is &s;aid to be a wi&s;e, brave and good natur'd Prince; in&s;omuch that the <HI>Indians</HI> had a mind to have &s;et him up in&s;tead of <HI>Ambro&s;io,</HI> who is of a rugged military Temper. But <HI>Ambro&s;io</HI>'s Authority and Power is &s;o great, that they did not find it practicable. <HI>Nicola</HI> is a mortal Enemy to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and can never entertain a good thought of them, &s;ince the Governor of <HI>Porto-Bello</HI> robb'd him of a curious Fu&s;ee that had been pre&s;ented him by &s;ome of the Buccaneers; and being out of order, he &s;ent it thither to be mended; upon which the Governour taking a liking to it, kept it to him|&s;elf, and &s;ent <HI>Nicola</HI> another &s;orry piece in&s;tead of it.</P>
<P>Since we came hither, there have been an <HI>Eng|li&s;h,</HI> a <HI>Dutch,</HI> and a <HI>French</HI> Ship in our Bay. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship was Captain <HI>Long</HI> in the <HI>Rupert</HI> Prize; He had been in the Gulf of <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ba,</HI> but he him&s;elf and his Men own'd, that they had not then been a&s;hore there. He hath &s;ome way or other di&s;oblig'd the Captains <HI>Ambro&s;io</HI> and <HI>Diego.</HI> Tho' we treated him
<PB N="90" REF="46">
with all po&s;&s;ible Civility, yet we are &s;ince inform'd that he hath been a days Journey into the Gulf, and endeavour'd to incen&s;e the <HI>Indians</HI> again&s;t us, telling them that we were Privateers, and that the King of <HI>England</HI> would not protect us. He left &s;ome Men in the Bay, who had &s;ince kill'd &s;ome <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and came to us for Arms and Ammuni|tion, but we told them, we could not grant them any, and that they had done what they could not ju&s;tifie. We gave them however what was nece&s;|&s;ary for &s;itting up a Boat; and as a Reward, they intic'd away the Carpenter and Mate of one of our Ships call'd the <HI>&V;nicorn.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship that came hither was afraid of the Spani&s;h <HI>Barl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">vento</HI> Fleet, and put in here for Protection, that Fleet having made Prize of ano|ther <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship of 32 Guns&punc; and of two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Sloops for Trading on tho&s;e Coa&s;ts.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> Ship that put in here, was that which was order'd to carry back the Church Plate, &amp;c. to <HI>Carthagena,</HI> did afterwards bulge on a Rock, and was ca&s;t away in our Harbour. We &s;av'd all their lives, and Captain <HI>Pincarton</HI> our Commodore endan|ger'd his own life to &s;ave that of the <HI>French</HI> Captain. He inform'd us, That the <HI>French</HI> had four Men of War of 50 Guns each, who thinking we had a De&s;ign on the River <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ipi,</HI> were gone to the Gulf of <HI>Mexico</HI> in que&s;t of us. The <HI>French</HI> have been ve|ry indu&s;trious in cultivating their Intere&s;t, both with the Natives and <HI>Spaniards</HI> in this part of <HI>Ame|rica,</HI> and doubt not of having a good &s;hare in tho&s;e Countries after the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Death. They have got a great Intere&s;t with Captain <HI>Ambro&s;io</HI> by means of his Son-in-Law <HI>Don Pedro,</HI> whom they care&s;s extreamly, and de&s;ign'd to have carried him to <HI>Petit Guavus,</HI> and from thence into <HI>France,</HI> to acquaint the <HI>French</HI> King with the favourable Sen|timents the <HI>Indians</HI> have entertain'd of the <HI>French,</HI> and of their de&s;ign to &s;urrender them&s;elves to his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="46">
This has been projected by the <HI>French</HI> a long time, but the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Indi&s;po&s;ition&punc; and their Pre|ten&s;ions to that Crown, made them refer it: and there's no doubt but our Settlement will quicken tho&s;e Re&s;olutions. Captain <HI>Andreas,</HI> Captain <HI>Pedro</HI> his Brother, Captain <HI>Diego,</HI> and Captain <HI>Pou&s;igo</HI> our Neighbours have no manner of Corre&s;pondence with the <HI>French.</HI> The latter hath acquainted us that there are &s;everal Gold Mines within two Miles of our Settlement which he hath promis'd to &s;hew us; and he hath actually let us &s;ee &s;everal Samples of fine Gold.</P>
<P>This being the Sub&s;tance of &s;everal Journals that were &s;ent from our Colony in <HI>Darien</HI> upon their fir&s;t Settlement there, we hope it's &s;ufficient of it &s;elf to &s;atisfie our Neighbours in <HI>England</HI> of the Ju&s;tice of our Cau&s;e, of the Equity of our Proceedings, of the true Rea&s;on why the <HI>French</HI> are &s;o much our Ene|mies in this matter, of the greatne&s;s of the Provi|dence that has put us in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that Po&s;t, and that it is <HI>England</HI>'s Intere&s;t to joyn with and protect us, by which the De&s;igns of the <HI>French</HI> again&s;t <HI>Eu|rope</HI> in general&punc; and <HI>Great Britain</HI> in particular, may be defeated&punc; and the <HI>Engli&s;h We&s;t-India</HI> Trade &s;e|cur'd.
