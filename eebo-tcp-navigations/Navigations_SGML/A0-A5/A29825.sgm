<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>_HAving given the Engli&s;h World an Account of &s;ome remote and &s;eldome travelled Countries of <HI>Europe,</HI> in the Year, 1673. I remained indifferent, as to the publi&s;hing any thing more, concerning nearer, or bet|ter known places; a great part whereof hath been delivered by &s;ome good, and ob&s;erving Writers; upon which con&s;ide|ration, though written &s;ome years &s;ince, the&s;e Papers have not come abroad, and had &s;till remained private, had not the de&s;ires of Friends &s;olicited this Publica|tion, and al&s;o a Promi&s;e in my former Book oblig'd me to &s;ay &s;omething of <HI>Vi|enna;</HI> as likewi&s;e my Journey unto that Place from <HI>England,</HI> by the <HI>Belgian Pro|vinces</HI>
<PB REF="3"> and <HI>Germany;</HI> and of my Return from <HI>Vienna</HI> by <HI>Au&s;tria Trans-Danu|biana, Moravia, Bohemia, Mi&s;nia, Saxonia,</HI> unto <HI>Hamburg;</HI> hereof I have therefore given &s;ome Account in this Work, not much engaging into the Policy and State Government of Places, which have been &s;o largely delivered, as to make up ju&s;t Volumes, but have rather &s;et down what is Naturally, Artificially, Hi&s;tori|cally, and Topographically remarkable; together with &s;ome Cu&s;tomes and Occur|rencies which might be acceptable unto the Inqui&s;itive Reader, or &s;erve as hints of further Enquiry, to &s;uch Per&s;ons as may hereafter Travel into tho&s;e Parts.</P>

<HEAD>A JOURNEY FROM NORWICH TO COLEN in <HI>GERMANY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_IN the year 1668. I left the large and plea&s;ant City of <HI>Norwich,</HI> and went by land to <HI>Yarmouth</HI> a Port Town in <HI>Norfolk,</HI> at the mouth of the River <HI>Hierus</HI> or <HI>Yare;</HI> large, fairly built and populous, very con&s;iderable for the great Herring fi&s;hing in the Au|tumn, and the commerce it maintain|eth in the Streights; <HI>Baltick, Briti&s;h</HI> and <HI>German</HI> Seas: With <HI>Italians, French, Spaniards, Dutch, Danes,</HI> and <HI>Swedes.</HI> I was here nobly entertained by that worthy and obliging per&s;on, Sr. <HI>Iames Iohn&s;on,</HI> who al&s;o fur|ni&s;h't me with letters of Credit, to <HI>Am&s;terdam, Franck|fort, Venice</HI> and <HI>Vienna;</HI> Whereby I was readily and hand&s;omely accommodated in all Parts where I had af|terwards occa&s;ion to travel.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="4">
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> the 14. about &s;ix a clock at night I went a|board the <HI>Angel-Ketch</HI> in <HI>Yarmouth</HI> Road, a Ve&s;&s;el of a|bout 55 Tuns, and we immediately &s;et &s;ayl for <HI>Rotter|dam;</HI> we left St. <HI>Nicholas-Sand</HI> on the Larboard, and after that the <HI>Nowles,</HI> a new Sand, not taken notice of to be rai&s;ed above twelve years before. We kept our cour&s;e all night, Ea&s;t and by South and Ea&s;t South Ea&s;t. The Sea burned at the head of the Ship at the beginning of the night, but the Moon ri&s;ing there appeared nothing but froth. In the morning we di&s;covered <HI>Grave&s;andt</HI> Steeple. It is the cu&s;tom upon all this coa&s;t to &s;end out Pylot-boats continually to meet all Ships at Sea, and furni&s;h them with Pylots to bring them through the &s;ands, and no Ship is to refu&s;e one: Having taken in our Pylot, we &s;oon di&s;covered <HI>Gor&eacute;&eacute;</HI> Steeple, and then the <HI>Briel.</HI> We entred the River <HI>Mo&s;a,</HI> or <HI>Maes,</HI> a Large and noble Stream, which ari&s;ing in the Mountaines of <HI>Vauge,</HI> or <HI>Voge&s;us,</HI> pa&s;&s;ing by <HI>Verdun, Dinant, Namur, Liege, Mae&s;tricht, Ruremond, Venlo,</HI> and many con&s;iderable Places, doth here fall into the Ocean, we had a very plea&s;ant pa&s;&s;age up the River, &s;ayling by many neat Vil|lages, as <HI>Mae&s;e-&s;luys, Schedam, Delfshaven,</HI> and hand|&s;ome rowes of Trees upon the &s;hore, and arrived at <HI>Rot|terdam</HI> about &s;ix at night. This is one of the three chief pa&s;&s;ages by Sea into <HI>Holland,</HI> the other being by <HI>Flu&s;hing</HI> and the <HI>Texell.</HI> The neare&s;t cut out of <HI>Eng|land</HI> into <HI>Holland</HI> is from <HI>Lai&s;toffe</HI> Point to <HI>Grave|&s;andt,</HI> which is 28 Leagues, and the deepe&s;t part of the Sea is about 28 Fathoms. There lay two of the grea|te&s;t Ships in <HI>Holland</HI> at that time near <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> the <HI>Crane</HI> and the <HI>Wa&s;&s;enaer;</HI> this latter built in lieu of that in which Admiral <HI>Opdam</HI> was blown up, fighting again&s;t his Royal Highne&s;s the Duke of <HI>Yorke.</HI> The Heads or Keyes between which we entred the towne by water are
<PB N="3" REF="4"> hand&s;ome, and Ships of great burden are received into the middle of divers &s;treets without difficulty, (their Channels being deep and large) the hou&s;es are well built, and the town Populous, they have an Exchange or place for Merchants to meet at, the &s;treets are &s;o clean that the Women goe about in white Slippers, they being paved with Bricks laid edgwi&s;e. The <HI>Landthui&s;e</HI> hath a fair front. In the great Church the Organs, the Tower and the Monument of <HI>De wit,</HI> upon the Bridge the Statue of <HI>Era&s;mus,</HI> as al&s;o the hou&s;e where he was born, and the Plea&s;ure boats of the States are worth the &s;eeing. It be|ing then the time of their <HI>Kermis</HI> or Faire, there were playes acted and many rarities &s;hewn, as <HI>Lions, Leopards,</HI> &amp;c, and a great noi&s;e was made about a tall Woman to be &s;hewn of &s;even foot high; but the Boor of <HI>Leckerkir'k,</HI> not far from this town, was higher. <HI>Par&s;ons</HI> and <HI>Evans,</HI> porters to King <HI>Charles</HI> the fir&s;t, did al&s;o exceed her, but I have &s;eldom heard of any that was taller than <HI>Martin Wierw&s;ki</HI> a Polander, who at the age of forty two years was pre&s;ented to the Emperour <HI>Maximilian</HI> the &s;econd, as a rarity of nature, and was full eight foot high, who&s;e picture, as big as the life, I &s;aw, near to the <HI>Franci&s;cans</HI> Con|vent at <HI>Vienna</HI> in <HI>Au&s;tria.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Rotterdam</HI> I pa&s;&s;ed by <HI>Over&s;chee</HI> to <HI>Delft,</HI> by the Powderhou&s;e, which is a hand&s;ome one, built now at &s;ome di&s;tance from the towne to prevent the like acci|dent which befell when the former took fire and blew up part of the town. The <HI>Piazza</HI> or market-place is a very fair one, having the front of the town hou&s;e at one end of it, and the high &s;teeple of the new Church at the o|ther. In the old Church, <HI>Van-Tromps</HI> Tombe is very well carved upon the &s;ide of the Wall, him&s;elf lying up|on a Canon encompa&s;&s;ed with Arms and trophies. In the middle I&s;le of the new Church there is a noble
<PB N="4" REF="5"> monument, the Tombe of <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Na&s;&s;aw</HI> Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> together with his Wife and Son, Prince <HI>Maurice;</HI> his <HI>Statua</HI> is in armour with his Dog at his feet, and four Obelisks are &s;upported by ten Marble pillars. In a hou&s;e of this Town there were &s;hewn me in a Wall the marks of the bullets &s;hot at Prince <HI>William,</HI> who was thereby murthered 1584. and in another Church which was broad and &s;pacious I &s;aw a hand&s;ome Tomb for Sr. <HI>Charles Morgans</HI> Lady, and the Monument of <HI>Peter Hein</HI> the Admiral, who took the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Silver|&s;leet.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hague, Haga Comitis,</HI> the ancient place of Re&s;i|dence of the Counts of <HI>Holland,</HI> and now of the States ge|neral; is about an hours-going di&s;tant from <HI>Delft;</HI> in which pa&s;&s;age, at &s;ome di&s;tance, we had a &s;ight of two of the Prince of <HI>Orange's</HI> hou&s;es. This place is well built; the Prince's Court hand&s;ome; The <HI>Piazza</HI> by it full of green trees; many fair Hou&s;es. The Cour&s;e where the Coach|es meet, the Pall-mall, the Wood, the Park, do much beautifie it, and the way from hence to <HI>Scheveling,</HI> from whence his Maje&s;ty returned into <HI>England,</HI> is very remark|able, it being a &s;treight way cut through the Sand-hills, and paved with Brick for three miles, having on each hand four or five rows of Trees, and <HI>Scheveling</HI> Steeple at the end of it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hague</HI> and <HI>Mad rid</HI> in <HI>Spain</HI> are accounted the greate&s;t Villages, or open unwalled places, in <HI>Europe,</HI> and the <HI>Hollanders</HI> have thought it more honour to be Ma&s;ters of the greate&s;t Village, than of a place which, if it were walled, would come &s;hort of many Cities; but this may prove a dangerous re&s;olution, for formerly upon this ad|vantage, <HI>Martin van Ro&s;&s;em,</HI> Captain to the Duke of <HI>Gueldres,</HI> &s;acked the <HI>Hague;</HI> and it was lately in the like danger when the <HI>French</HI> Forces lay at <HI>Utrecht</HI> and <HI>Wor|den,</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="5"> if they had forced a pa&s;&s;age into that part of <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Leyden</HI> is three hours or three <HI>Dutch</HI> miles from the <HI>Hague,</HI> at pre&s;ent one of the neare&s;t Towns in <HI>Europe;</HI> Well built, hath divers large Streets, beautified with rowes of Trees, and the water pa&s;&s;ing through the middle of them, and al&s;o well fortified after the modern way; I took notice of that Antiquity called <HI>Hengi&s;t</HI> Ca&s;tle, or the <HI>Berg,</HI> &s;aid to be built by <HI>Hengi&s;t</HI> the <HI>Saxon,</HI> and went up to the top thereof: Upon the top there is now an Arbour, and a Maze or Labyrinth round it, and a Well, out of which, they told us, they took a Fi&s;h alive when the Town was almo&s;t fami&s;hed during the &s;iege, which was &s;hewed to the Enemy over the wall, endeavouring to make their condition to appear better than it was, and to di&s;hearten the be&s;iegers. There are now hand&s;ome &s;tairs from the top to the bottom, and a good hou&s;e built by it, where they have their publick &s;ales and en|tertainments. But a nobler Antiquity lieth under the Sea, than any above ground; not far from hence near <HI>Calwyck</HI> is a &s;quare fortre&s;s called <HI>Arx Britannica,</HI> built by <HI>Caligu|la;</HI> in the declining of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire ruined in part by the <HI>Normans,</HI> and afterwards neglected, &amp; over whelm|ed by the Sea. But in &s;ome years, and great retire of the Sea, the ruines have been di&s;covered, and many no|ble Antiquities brought from it, &s;ome having this in|&s;cription <HI>Ex. Ger. Inf. ex Germania inferiori.</HI> The <HI>Stadthui&s;e</HI> hath a fair front towards the &s;treet. In the Anatomy Schools are a very great number of <HI>Skeletons.</HI> Two legs of an <HI>Elephant.</HI> The <HI>Skeleton</HI> of a young <HI>Whale,</HI> of a <HI>Hor&s;e, Deer, Cow, Cat, Fox,</HI> and many other Animals; divers <HI>Skeletons</HI> of Men and Women, &s;ome bodies pre&s;erved with their Mu&s;cles, and one intire, the fle&s;h, skin and all parts defended from corruption. I &s;aw al&s;o here what Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Bils</HI> pretended towards
<PB N="6" REF="6"> the pre&s;ervation of Bodies, but more accurately after|wards at Dr. <HI>Rui&s;ch</HI> his hou&s;e at <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> The Phy&s;ick-garden, although but &s;mall, is well filled with Plants, where are al&s;o many other both natural, and artificiall Curio|&s;ities to be &s;een, and many &s;orts of <HI>Optick gla&s;&s;es.</HI> Near the garden are the Schools built of Brick with the <HI>Officina Elzeviriana</HI> on the top. In the Churches I &s;aw the Monuments of many famous men. There is a Picture in the Chamber for the Burgerma&s;ters, repre&s;ent|ing the day of Judgment, drawn by <HI>Lucas van Leyden,</HI> &s;o much e&s;teemed that, it is &s;aid, the Emperour <HI>Ru|dolphus</HI> would have given for it as many Ducats of Gold as would have covered it. The Table al&s;o upon which <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Leyden</HI> wrought whil&s;t he was a Taylor, is a Curio&s;ity, becau&s;e he proved afterwards &s;o con&s;iderable a di&s;turber of <HI>Germany,</HI> and came to be King of the <HI>Anabapti&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>This City endured a hard &s;iege by the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> forces, and they were reduced unto great extremity, but they &s;aved them&s;elves by overflowing the Country, and &s;o forcing the Enemies to make away with great lo&s;s; and afterwards coyned a memorial-Medall with this In&s;crip|tion.</P>
<P><HI>Ut Senacherib &agrave;</HI> Jeru&s;alem, <HI>&s;ic Hi&s;pani a Leydae noctu fu|gerunt.</HI> 1574.</P>
<P>From <HI>Leyden</HI> I came to <HI>Haerlem,</HI> a neat City, plea|&s;antly &s;eated and having a Grove near it. The great Church is e&s;teemed the large&s;t in <HI>Holland,</HI> with a very high Lanthorn upon it. Within are many In&s;criptions and Monuments, mo&s;t of which are tran&s;cribed and &s;et down in <HI>Gotfr. Hegenitii Itinerarium Hollandicum.</HI> In the Prin|ce's hou&s;e are all the Earles of <HI>Holland</HI> Painted upon the wall, and in the Garden in the Summer-hou&s;e, the Pict|ure of <HI>Laurentius Co&s;terus,</HI> who is &s;aid to have fir&s;t in|vented the art of Printing in this Town; but others attri|bute
<PB N="7" REF="6"> it to <HI>Johannes Gottenberg,</HI> a <HI>German.</HI> On the o|ther &s;ide there is a Picture of a Ship with Saws, in memo|ry of the manner how <HI>Damiata</HI> in <HI>Egypt</HI> was formerly ta|ken by tho&s;e of this Town, who, as they report, accom|panied <HI>Frederick Barbaro&s;&s;a</HI> in an expedition again&s;t the <HI>Saracens,</HI> and when the men of <HI>Pelu&s;ium</HI> or <HI>Damiata</HI> had chamed up their Port, by this invention of fa&s;tning &s;trong Saws to the keels of their Ships, they cut the chains in &s;under, and &s;o took the Town. In the rooms are very good Paintings by <HI>Hemskerk,</HI> and <HI>Goltzius,</HI> as his <HI>Prometheus</HI> and other Peeces; but <HI>Cornelius van Haerlem</HI> mo&s;t delighted me, in his peeces of <HI>Herods</HI> kil|ling the Innocent Children; his fea&s;t of the Gods, in which <HI>Vulcans foot</HI> is e&s;teemed at a great rate; and ano|ther Picture of a Frier and a Nun at a Collation, not in&s;e|riour to the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The old Mens hou&s;e, or an Ho&s;pital for &s;ixty aged per&s;ons, is large and hand&s;ome; having a good Qua|drangle and a Garden in it. The Ho&s;pital al&s;o for the &s;ick is very cleanly kept.</P>
<P>Here I fir&s;t &s;aw the manner of puni&s;hing Malefact|ours by whipping them with rods, which is more &s;e|vere than I imagined; they lead them to a Po&s;t upon a &s;caffold, their hands tyed and by a pully drawn up as high as they can be extended, and then an Iron fa&s;tned a|bout their wa&s;t to keep them &s;teady; in which &s;tretched|out po&s;ture they receive &s;ometimes fifty or &s;ixty &s;tripes or more, according to the merit of their offence.</P>
<P>Not far from this place there is a great Water, or no|ted Lake called <HI>Haerlem Meere</HI> about twenty miles in length, which is frozen over in hard Winters, and men &s;wiftly travel over it by &s;liding, or in &s;leds. When <HI>Haer|lem</HI> was be&s;ieged there was a Naval &s;ight upon it; The <HI>Dutch</HI> having about an hundred and fifty Ve&s;&s;els, and the
<PB N="8" REF="7"> <HI>Spaniards</HI> not many fewer. The Town was afterwards taken by Compo&s;ition, but &s;uch cruelty was u&s;ed by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> that they have not yet forgot it.</P>
<P>From <HI>Haerlem</HI> I went to <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> a City at pre|&s;ent for Riches, Trade, Shipping, fair Streets, and plea&s;ant habitations, &s;carce yielding to any other of the World. It is &s;eated upon the River <HI>Ye,</HI> and hath its name, as 'tis reported, from a Ca&s;tle appertaining long &s;ince to the Lords of <HI>Am&s;tel,</HI> to whom this place al&s;o belonged: At the beginning, the &s;eat of a few fi&s;hermen; but after|wards increa&s;ing, it received many priviledges from the Counts of <HI>Holland,</HI> and was made a Town or City by the favour of their Grants and Charters. In the year 1470. it was walled about with a Brick-wall, to defend it a|gain&s;t the Citizens of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> they having been in great danger to have fallen into their hands, if tho&s;e of <HI>Utrecht</HI> had pur&s;ued their victories. In few Months after al&s;o, the whole Town was almo&s;t reduced to A&s;hes by fire, but by the increa&s;e of their Traffick they ea&s;ily overcame the&s;e lo&s;&s;es, waded through all difficulties, and rendred good &s;ervices to their Counts, and received the honour afterwards from <HI>Maximilian</HI> the Emperour to have the Imperiall Crown over their Armes, which are three <HI>Cro&s;|&s;es</HI> on a <HI>Pale</HI></P>
<P>About the year 1525. <HI>Gelen,</HI> &s;ent from the new King of <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> pa&s;&s;ed through <HI>Frie&s;land</HI> and came to this City; where having made a party, and communicated his de|&s;ign, he re&s;olved to &s;urprize the Town by night, at the time of the &s;ounding of the Bell; to which intent they were already entred the Market place, had &s;et upon the Town hou&s;e: and cut in pieces tho&s;e who re&s;i&s;ted them. When by great providence the rope to the great Bell was taken away; the Magi&s;trates had notice of it, and cau&s;ed all the &s;treets and Avenues leading to the Market-place to
<PB N="9" REF="7"> be &s;topped up with Wool&s;acks and Hop&s;acks, whereby they were hindred in their de&s;ign of taking the Town by night, and the next morning their number being di&s;cover|ed to be incon&s;iderable, they were &s;et upon, driven into the <HI>Stadthuis,</HI> and defeated.</P>
<P>Of late years this City is mightily encrea&s;ed and en|compa&s;&s;ed with a new Wall, and fortified after the modern way. The new Streets are large and uniform: and the whole Town being in a low Mar&s;hy ground, the water is let in through all the con&s;iderable Streets. The River <HI>Am&s;tel</HI> pa&s;&s;eth through the City, being let in under a hand&s;ome well-contrived Bridge of Eleven Arches, which is &s;o built as to make part of the Wall and Rampart, and is 26 paces broad. The whole Town is built upon Piles, or high Firr-trees, driven down perpendicularly into the Earth &s;o thick together, that nothing more can be forced in between them: And by this means they build Hou&s;es in the Sea, and lay Foundations &s;trong enough to &s;upport the greate&s;t Buildings what&s;oever, in places where no &s;olid bottom is to be found. But they mu&s;t needs be at a great expence and labour before they can lay the fir&s;t Stone: And the number of Trees required to each Foundation is con&s;iderable; &s;ince for the Foun|dation of one Tower or Steeple alone, over again&s;t the Church of St. <HI>Katherine,</HI> Mr. <HI>J. de Parivall,</HI> who wrote <HI>Les Delices de la Hollande,</HI> reckoneth that there was ram|med into the ground a <HI>Forre&s;t,</HI> as he calls it, of Six thou|&s;and three hundred and thirty four great Trees. About this manner of work, for the fixing their Foundations, I &s;aw them employed in divers places, particularly at the <HI>Ea&s;t-India-hou&s;e,</HI> and at a place where a <HI>Lutheran</HI> Church was then de&s;igned to be built, So that it was not improbably &s;aid, <HI>That if a man could &s;ee all under this City, he could hardly behold a greater Forre&s;t.</HI></P>
<PB N="10" REF="8">
<P>The <HI>Stadthuis</HI> or <HI>Town-hou&s;e,</HI> is the noble&s;t Building in all the&s;e Countries. A Pile of Free&s;tone of an hundred and ten paces in Front, being larger than the Magnified Front of the Church of St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s at <HI>Rome,</HI> and eighty one paces deep, or on the &s;ides. The Chambers in it, the Pictures and Statues, are worthy to be &s;een and admi|red. The fir&s;t Room on the right hand, or <HI>Judgment|hall,</HI> where the Malefactors receive their Sentence, is a|dorned with large Statues, hanging down their heads in mournful po&s;tures, as if concerned or grieving at what was then pronounced. The Floors are of Marble; the Roofs are richly gil't and painted. Upon the top of all &s;tands <HI>Atlas</HI> or <HI>Columlus,</HI> holding a Globe upon his &s;houl|der made of Copper, of about ten foot Diameter, which is as large perhaps as any Ball or Globe what&s;oever em|ployed to this ornamental u&s;e. That upon St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s at <HI>Rome,</HI> as having been in it, I judge to be le&s;s; as like|wi&s;e that at <HI>Florence.</HI> The <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Ornament to the Tower of their <HI>Mo&s;ques,</HI> is three Balls one above another, and an half Moon over them, but they are le&s;s by far, at lea&s;t &s;uch as I have &s;een: and by relation from Eye-wit|ne&s;&s;es, the large&s;t of the three noble gilded Balls at <HI>Mo|rocco</HI> are inferiour to this. But I will &s;ay nothing more of this great building, the <HI>Stadthuis,</HI> &s;ince there is a peculiar de&s;cription of it in Folio, with Cuts and Figures of the mo&s;t remarkable Curio&s;ities in it. The <HI>Exchange</HI> is fair and large, and above it are Shops: it is very well frequented, and he that cometh after twelve payeth &s;ix &s;tivers.</P>
<P>Divers of their Churches are fair: In the new Church, the partition with Balli&s;ters of Bra&s;s, and the carved Pul|pit, are noble. In the old Church the Tomb of <HI>Van Hul&s;e</HI> and <HI>Heemskerk</HI> are remarkable. <HI>Heemskerk</HI> did his Country great Services in their fir&s;t attempts upon <HI>In|dia:</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="8"> for the King of <HI>Spain</HI> having con&s;i&s;cated &s;ome of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Ships, who traded to his Dominions, which were then the Staple for the <HI>India</HI> Trade. It was re&s;olved by the permi&s;&s;ion of Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> and the States, to &s;et out a Fleet of eight &s;hips for the <HI>Indies;</HI> four of which were to pa&s;s by the way of the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean, and the Cape of <HI>Good-hope:</HI> And the other four were to &s;earch a pa&s;&s;age towards the Kingdoms of <HI>Cathay</HI> and <HI>China</HI> by the North-ea&s;t, whereby the pa&s;&s;age al&s;o into tho&s;e parts might be expected much &s;horter than that which was known to the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>To this intent the&s;e four la&s;t ve&s;&s;els &s;ailed out of the <HI>Texel, June</HI> 5. 1594. and returned in <HI>September,</HI> not be|ing able to proceed by rea&s;on of the Ice. But upon the relation of the Voyage by <HI>William Baren&s;on,</HI> there were two other Expeditions afterwards to <HI>Nova Zembla;</HI> in the la&s;t of which they wintered there, and <HI>Baren&s;on</HI> lo&s;t his life. <HI>Heemskerk</HI> was the chief of the twelve which returned from that cold habitation, where none but Bears and Foxes could well endure the Winter, where he had been twice, and afterwards made two rich Voyages into <HI>India.</HI> Upon who&s;e happy returns the <HI>Holland Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company was fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed, and a prohibition made for any other of that Country to trade thither for the &s;pace of One and twenty years.</P>
<P>But to proceed to other publick Buildings in this Ci|ty. The <HI>Tuchthuis</HI> or <HI>Ra&s;pelhuis,</HI> or Hou&s;e of Correction for debauched young men, &s;uch as are incorrigible and di&s;|obedient to Parents or Laws, hath at the entrance of the Gate two Lions bridled, a proper Embleme, with this In&s;cription, <HI>Virtutis e&s;t domare quae cuncti pavent.</HI> This was formerly a Mona&s;tery belonging to the Nuns of the Order of St. <HI>Clare,</HI> and converted to this u&s;e 1595. They who are put in, are forced to work and gain their Bread
<PB N="12" REF="9"> with hard labour. I &s;aw tho&s;e who ra&s;ped <HI>Brazil,</HI> having a certain task &s;et them every day, work &s;o hard, that be|ing naked and in a &s;weat, and the du&s;t of the <HI>Brazil</HI> wood flying upon them, they were all over painted of a beau|tiful red colour. Which odd &s;ight made me call to mind the Phan&s;ie of my Lady Marchione&s;s of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> of a Nation wherein the People were of Orange-tawny colour, and the King of Purple.</P>
<P>They told us that &s;ome that were committed to their charge, and not to be brought to work by blows, they placed in a large Ci&s;tern, and let the water in upon them; placing only a Pump by them for their relief, whereby they are forced to labour for their lives, and to free them&s;elves from drowning. One we &s;aw put into a narrow Dungeon, and kept from meat. Some are put into this Hou&s;e for a longer time, &s;ome for a &s;horter. It hath been a puni&s;hment for &s;uch as have drawn their Daggers, or offered to &s;tab any one. And &s;ome Citizens, though able and rich enough, contrive it &s;o, that when their Sons are extravagant and ma&s;terle&s;s, the Officers &s;eize upon them, and carry them into this Hou&s;e, where they are not forced to any hard labour, but kept in till they &s;ee &s;uf|ficient &s;igns of a mending their life.</P>
<P>This way of Correction may &s;eem &s;evere to many, yet is not comparable to that which is &s;aid to have been for|merly u&s;ed in <HI>Germany.</HI> Particularly at <HI>Colen,</HI> in the <HI>white Tower,</HI> at the North end of the Town, near the <HI>Rhine;</HI> where it is reported, that &s;uch Youths who were not otherwi&s;e to be reclaimed, were in a barbarous manner &s;hut up in the <HI>white Tower.</HI> The height and thickne&s;s of the walls &s;ecured them from e&s;caping, or from their complaints being heard. Near the top was placed out of their reach a loaf of bread, the la&s;t remedy again&s;t &s;tarving, which while their bold nece&s;&s;ity forced
<PB N="13" REF="9"> them to reach at, they executed their la&s;t &s;entence upon them&s;elves, and mi&s;erably brake their own necks.</P>
<P>Somewhat like the <HI>Ra&s;pelhuis</HI> is the <HI>Spinhuis,</HI> or Hou&s;e of Correction, for the young women who live loo&s;ely, are taken in the night, or can give no account of their living. They are put in for a certain time, according as their fault meriteth, and are bound to make lace, &s;ew, or employ their time perpetually in &s;ome hone&s;t labour.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e of the better &s;ort are permitted to have Cham|bers apart. In one large Room I &s;aw about an hundred of them, and &s;ome very well dre&s;&s;ed and fine, which was an unexpected &s;ight to me, and would &s;ure be more &s;trange to behold in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Wee&s;huis,</HI> or Ho&s;pital for Children, where there are Six hundred Orphans carefully looked after, and well educated.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dolhuis,</HI> or a Hou&s;e for &s;uch as are Delirious, Ma|niacal, or Melancholical of both Sexes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ga&s;thuis,</HI> or Ho&s;pital for the Sick, being large, and hath a great Revenue.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mannenhuis,</HI> or Ho&s;pital for old Men, and &s;uch as are no longer able to labour towards their own &s;up|port.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides all which, there are great Sums of mony col|lected for the poor, &s;o that there is not a Begger to be &s;een in the Streets, and upon all a&s;&s;ignations or appoint|ments of meeting at the Tavern, or el&s;ewhere, and upon many other occa&s;ions, who&s;oever faileth to come at the exact time, forfeiteth more or le&s;s to the u&s;e of the Poor.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ea&s;t-India-hou&s;es</HI> are remarkable, and the great Stores of their Commodities, <HI>Cinamon, Green-ginger, Camphire, Pepper, Calecuts, Indico, &amp;c.</HI> The &s;hips are of a great burden: their Hou&s;e was then enlarging, although
<PB N="14" REF="10"> it was great before; and a perfect Town for all Trades within it &s;elf.</P>
<P>The <HI>Admiralteyt,</HI> or Admiralty where their Stores for War and Shipping are laid up, is encompa&s;&s;ed with wa|ter; near to it there lay then 72 Men of War. In the Hou&s;e we &s;aw their Cables, Grapling irons, Pullies, Oars, Char|ges for Powder, Lanthorns for &s;hips, &amp;c. At the en|trance of the Gate hangeth up a <HI>Canoe</HI> with a man in it, dryed up, &s;o as to be pre&s;erved from corruption, and a Paddle in his hand: he was enclo&s;ed up to the wa&s;te in the <HI>Canoe,</HI> in &s;uch &s;ort, as the Fi&s;h-skins, which were the cover to it, being &s;o &s;ewed together that no water could get in, he might keep the Sea in the greate&s;t Storms with|out danger. The top of this Hou&s;e, as of divers others al&s;o in this City, is a Re&s;ervatory for Rain-water, which they have the more need of, becau&s;e they have little good water hereabouts.</P>
<P>The faire&s;t Streets in the Town are <HI>Harlem-&s;treet,</HI> the <HI>Cingel, Princes Graft, Kai&s;ers Graft,</HI> and the New Build|ings in the I&s;land towards <HI>Gottenburg.</HI> And if they con|tinue to build with Free&s;tone, they will &s;till &s;urpa&s;s the&s;e, which, I'le a&s;&s;ure you, are in no &s;mall mea&s;ure beauti|ful.</P>
<P>I &s;aw a Globe to be &s;old, made by <HI>Vingbomes,</HI> between &s;ix and &s;even foot Diameter, valued at Sixteen thou&s;and Guldens: The Meridian alone, being of bra&s;s, co&s;t a thou&s;and Guldens. The Globe is made of Copper-plates excellently well painted, with all the new Di&s;coveries in it, as that of <HI>Anthony Van Dimons</HI> Land, found out 1642. in 42 degrees of Southern Latitude, and 170 of Longitude, tho&s;e towards the Northwe&s;t of <HI>Japan,</HI> and tho&s;e places both about <HI>N. Z.</HI> and al&s;o in the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Sea beyond the Streights of <HI>Voygats, New-Holland, We&s;t-Frie&s;land, Cape d'Hyver, &amp;c.</HI> but I have &s;ince met with a Book, which
<PB N="15" REF="10"> doth &s;omewhat contradict this; entituled <HI>A Voyage into the Northern Countries by Mon&s;ieur</HI> Martiniere, who went in one of the three &s;hips belonging to the Northern Company of <HI>Copenhagen,</HI> in the year 1653. and by that means had occa&s;ion to conver&s;e with the <HI>Norwegians, I&s;landers, Lap|landers, Kilops, Borandians, Siberians, Zemblians,</HI> and <HI>Samojedes,</HI> who are Neighbours to the <HI>Tartars</HI> and <HI>Tin|gor&s;es,</HI> in his 46 Chapter he expre&s;&s;eth him&s;elf after this manner. There having fallen into my hands &s;everal Geo|graphical Charts of &s;undry eminent and much celebrated Authors, I am much amazed to &s;ee how they are mi&s;taken in the po&s;ition of <HI>Zembla,</HI> which they place much nearer the North Pole than really it is; they divide it likewi&s;e by the Sea from <HI>Greenland,</HI> and place it far di&s;tant from it, when as indeed tho&s;e two Countries are Contiguous, the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Greenland</HI> butting upon the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Zem|bla,</HI> &s;o as did not the great quantity of Snow, and the violence of the cold render tho&s;e Borders uninhabitable, the pa&s;&s;age would be very ea&s;ie by Land from <HI>Greenland</HI> to <HI>Zembla,</HI> and from <HI>Zembla</HI> pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Pater-no&s;ter</HI> Mountains to enter into <HI>Samojedia,</HI> from thence into <HI>Tar|tary</HI> or <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> as one plea&s;ed: But of the truth of this we &s;hall be further informed at the return of Captain <HI>Wood.</HI></P>
<P>I was amazed likewi&s;e to &s;ee they had de&s;cribed the Streight called <HI>Voygat,</HI> not above ten French Leagues in length, whereas it contains above five and thirty Dutch Leagues, which is &s;ix times as much. Again, they would per&s;wade us that through that Streight our &s;hips might pa&s;s into the great <HI>Tartarian</HI> Ocean, which is a mi&s;take. And although they indeed do affirm that in the time of Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> of <HI>Na&s;&s;au,</HI> a Dutch Ve&s;&s;el pa&s;&s;ed that way into that Ocean, yet it is a manife&s;t errour, that Streight being bounded, as I &s;aid before, by the <HI>Pater-no&s;ter</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="11"> Mountains, which are half a League high, and the tops of them covered with perpetual Snow, which never di&s;|&s;olves. And of this I can give a po&s;itive te&s;timony, ha|ving been my &s;elf in that Streight under tho&s;e Mountains in the Dog-days, which is the hotte&s;t time of the year.</P>
<P>From the Steeple of the Old Church of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> I had a good pro&s;pect of the Town, and the great number of &s;hips lying upon one &s;ide of it, like a Wood; and all the Towns about it. The Roofs of the Hou&s;es being &s;harp, it is a mo&s;t uneven Town to be looked upon downward, as it is a hand&s;ome one to be looked on up|ward; and is not &s;o diverti&s;ing or plea&s;ing to the &s;ight, as &s;ome Towns in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> which have flatter Roofs, or el&s;e are covered with a fine black Slat or Ar|doi&s;e. Upon this, and all other Towers of the Town, a Trumpet is &s;ounded at Midnight, and in other parts of the City at &s;ix a Clock night and morning. At eleven a clock, the time of going on to the <HI>Exchange,</HI> there is good Mu&s;ick at the <HI>Stadthuis,</HI> given by the Earl of <HI>Lei|ce&s;ter.</HI> They make good Harmony al&s;o every hour in playing upon their Chimes and Bells in mo&s;t Steeples. And there is a Mu&s;ick-hou&s;e or Entertaining-hou&s;e, where any one is admitted for a Stiver, hears mo&s;t &s;orts of Mu|&s;ick, &s;eeth many good Water-works, and divers motions by Clock-work, Pictures, and other Diverti&s;ements.</P>
<P>During my &s;tay at <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> I had the opportunity of &s;eeing divers Learned Men, and Per&s;ons of Note. Dr. <HI>Rui&s;h</HI> &s;hewed us many Curio&s;ities in Anatomy, as the <HI>Skeletons</HI> of young Children, and <HI>Faetus's</HI> of all A|ges, neatly &s;et together, and very white; the <HI>Lympha|tick ve&s;&s;els</HI> &s;o pre&s;erved, as to &s;ee the <HI>valves</HI> in them. A Liver excarnated, &s;howing the Minute ve&s;&s;els, all &s;hining and clear. The Mu&s;cles of Children di&s;&s;ected and kept
<PB N="17" REF="11"> from corruption: entire Bodies pre&s;erved; the face of one was very remarkable, without the lea&s;t &s;pot or change of colour or alteration of the lineaments, from what might be expected immediately after death: he had then kept it two years, and hoped it would &s;o continue. Dr. <HI>Swammerdam</HI> &s;hewed us divers of his Experiments which he hath &s;et down in his Treati&s;e <HI>De Re&s;piratione;</HI> and a very fair Collection of In&s;ects brought from &s;everal Countries; a <HI>Stagg-fly</HI> of a very great bigne&s;s; an <HI>Indi|an Scolopendria,</HI> or <HI>Forty-foot;</HI> a fly called <HI>Ephemeron,</HI> and many other Curio&s;ities. Old <HI>Glawber</HI> the Chymi&s;t &s;hew|ed us his Laboratory: And we received much civility from <HI>Bla&s;ius</HI> the Phy&s;ick Profe&s;&s;our who hath wrote a Comment upon <HI>Ve&s;lingius.</HI></P>
<P>The Jews live more hand&s;omly and &s;plendidly here, than in any other place: Their chief Synagogue is large, adorned with Lamps of Bra&s;s and Silver. We happen|ed to be there at the Fea&s;t of their <HI>New-year;</HI> &s;o that their blowing of Horns, &s;howting and &s;inging was not omitted: Some of them under&s;tand divers Languages. I &s;aw one <HI>Mo&s;es di Pas,</HI> a Learned young Man, and <HI>Orobio</HI> a Phy&s;ician of Note. And I was &s;orry to &s;ee divers here to profe&s;s them&s;elves publickly Jews, who had lived at lea&s;t reputed Chri&s;tians, for a long time in other places: One who had been a <HI>Franci&s;can</HI> Frier thirty years: and another who had been Profe&s;&s;our &s;ome years at <HI>Tholouze,</HI> and before that Phy&s;ician to the King of <HI>Spain. Juda Leo</HI> a Jew, hath taken great pains in making a Model of the Temple of <HI>Solomon,</HI> of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Hou&s;e, the Fort of the Temple, the Tabernacle, the I&s;raelites encamping, and other Curio&s;ities. I was pre&s;ent at the Circumci&s;i|on of a Child; which is performed by thru&s;ting a Probe in between the <HI>Glans</HI> and <HI>Praeputium,</HI> and &s;eparating it, or dilating the <HI>Praeputium,</HI> &s;o as the inward Skin may be
<PB N="18" REF="12"> drawn forward as well as the outward; then by apply|ing an In&s;trument joynted like a Carpenters Rule, or a Sector, the Skin is held fa&s;t beyond the <HI>Glans,</HI> and with a broad Inci&s;ion-knife, or Circumci&s;ion-knife, the Foreskin is cut off clo&s;e to the In&s;trument; and what remains of Skin is immediately put back, the blood &s;top|ped with Powders, and a Plai&s;ter applyed; the Relations and Acquaintance &s;inging all the while, whereby the cries of the Infant are le&s;s heard.</P>
<P>Leaving <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> I pa&s;&s;ed by a peculiar Burial|place of the Jews, who are not permitted to interr their dead within the Walls, by <HI>Overskerk, Bamburg,</HI> and in &s;ix or &s;even hours arrived at <HI>Utretcht,</HI> in a Boat drawn with Hor&s;es through artificial Cuts of Water, which is the way of Travelling in <HI>Holland, Utretcht,</HI> and divers other Provinces of the <HI>Low-Countries.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Utretcht</HI> is an ancient, large, hand&s;ome City, and chief of the Province of the &s;ame name, called formerly <HI>Anto|nina,</HI> and afterwards <HI>Ultrajectum.</HI> Long famous for its Epi&s;copal See founded by <HI>Dagobert</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> who endowed it richly with Lands and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions: <HI>Willebald,</HI> or <HI>Willebrode</HI> an Engli&s;hman, was their fir&s;t Bi&s;hop, who converted the&s;e Countries unto Chri&s;tianity; and the following Bi&s;hops grew &s;o powerful, that they were able to bring many thou&s;and men into the field, and to wage great Wars again&s;t the Counts of <HI>Holland:</HI> Their Suc|ce&s;&s;ion al&s;o continued for above Nine hundred years. It is now an Univer&s;ity, founded by the States in the Year 1636. I &s;hall not trouble you with the Names of the Pro|fe&s;&s;ors; the Learned Mr. <HI>Ray,</HI> whom I had the honour to meet in divers places abroad, having already cau&s;ed to be printed the <HI>Series Lectionum</HI> of this and many other Univer&s;ities in the <HI>Low-Countries, Germany,</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> in his <HI>Ob&s;ervations Topographical, Moral. Phy&s;iological,</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="12"> &s;et forth 1673. The great Church hath a very high Tower, or three Steeples one above another: From the highe&s;t of which I had not only a good &s;ight of the Town it &s;elf, which lay under mine Eye like a Platform, but of many others al&s;o; <HI>Utretcht</HI> being in a plain flat Country, and &s;o well &s;eated, and encompa&s;&s;ed with &s;o populous a Country, that in a days Journey a man may go from hence to any one of fifty walled Towns and Cities. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Church here is an ancient Building; the Pillar in the middle of it, who&s;e Foundation could not be laid but upon Bulls-hides, is much taken notice of: It was built 1099. and hath the Picture of a Bull upon it with this In|&s;cription;</P>
<Q><L><HI>Accipe Po&s;teritas quod per tua &s;aecula narres,</HI></L>

<P>There is an old Library belonging to this Church, which containeth divers old Books and Manu&s;cripts. A large Bible in &s;ix Volumes, painted and gilded after a very ancient manner: Two Idols taken (in time of war) long &s;ince in <HI>Germany,</HI> and given to this place by the Emper|our <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth, are worth the &s;eeing, not &s;o much for their neatne&s;s, as their Antiquity and odd &s;hape: As al&s;o a Horn made out of a Tooth, &s;aid to be given at the &s;ame time. There are al&s;o three <HI>Unicorns</HI> Horns, little differing in length; the longe&s;t being five foot and an half: I drank out of one of them, the end being tipp'd with Silver, and made hollow to &s;erve for a Cup. The&s;e were of the <HI>Sea-Unicorn,</HI> or the Horn or long wreathed Tooth of &s;ome Sea-Animal much like it, taken in the Northern Seas; of which I have &s;een many, both in Publick Repo|&s;itories, and in Private Hands. Two &s;uch as the&s;e, the one Ten foot long, were pre&s;ented not many years &s;ince
<PB N="20" REF="13"> to the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> being taken near to <HI>Nova Zem|bla;</HI> and I have &s;een &s;ome full fifteen foot long; &s;ome wreathed very thick, &s;ome not &s;o much, and others al|mo&s;t plain: Some large&s;t and thicke&s;t at the End near the head; others are large&s;t at &s;ome di&s;tance from the Head: Some very &s;harp at the end or point, and others blunt. My honoured Father Sir <HI>T. B.</HI> hath a very fair piece of one which was formerly among the Duke of <HI>Curlands</HI> Rarities, but after that he was taken Pri&s;oner by <HI>Doug|las</HI> in the wars between <HI>Sweden</HI> and <HI>Poland,</HI> it came into a Merchants hands, of whom my Father had it, he hath al&s;o a piece of this &s;ort of <HI>Unicorns</HI> Horn burnt black, out of the Emperour of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI>'s <HI>Repo&s;itorie,</HI> given him by Dr. <HI>Arthur Dee,</HI> who was Son to Dr. <HI>John Dee,</HI> and al&s;o Phy&s;ician to the Emperour of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> when his Chambers were burned, in which he pre&s;erved his Curio&s;ities. I have &s;een a walking Staff, a Scepter, a Scabbard for a Sword, Boxes, and other Curio&s;ities made out of this Horn, but was never &s;o fortunate as from experience to confirm its Medical Efficacy again&s;t Poy&s;ons, contagious Di&s;ea&s;es, or any other evident effect of it, although I have known it given &s;everal times, and in great quanti|ty. But of the&s;e <HI>Unicorns</HI> Horns no man &s;ure hath &s;o great a Collection as the King of <HI>Denmark;</HI> and his Fa|ther had &s;o many, that he was able to &s;pare about an hun|dred of them, to build a Magnificent Throne out of <HI>U|nicorns</HI> Horns.</P>
<P>I had the honour to &s;ee divers Per&s;ons of Note in this City; as <HI>D.

<P>This Town is al&s;o beautified with a fair Piazza or Market-place, divers long Streets, and a <HI>Pall-mall</HI> with five rows of Trees on each &s;ide.

He that hath ob&s;erved the ea&s;ie accommodation for Travel there|in, both by Land and Water, their excellent order and regular cour&s;e in all things; the number of Learned men; the abundance of Varieties in all kinds; the indu&s;try, frugality, and wealth of the people; their numerous good Towns; their extraordinary neatne&s;s in their Build|ings and Hou&s;es; their proper Laws and admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice; and their incredible Number of Shipping and Boats, will think it an omi&s;&s;ion to re&s;t in the &s;ight of other Countries without a view of this. A Country of little extent, and &s;oon travelled over, but &s;o repleni&s;hed with People, with good Cities, fair Towns and Villages, as not to be met with upon &s;o little a compa&s;s of ground, except perhaps in <HI>China.</HI></P>

<P>Leaving <HI>Gorcum,</HI> I pa&s;&s;ed by <HI>Worcum,</HI> on the other &s;ide of the River, and then by the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Love&s;teyn,</HI> &s;trongly &s;eated and well fortified; and therefore hath been often made u&s;e of to &s;ecure Per&s;ons of Note.

<P><HI>Hertogen Bo&s;ch, Sylva Ducis, Bo&s;cum Ducis, Boi&s;le|duc, Bolduc,</HI> takes its name from a Wood belonging to the Dukes of <HI>Brabant:</HI> It is a &s;trong plea&s;ant City, &s;eated upon the River <HI>Di&s;a</HI> or <HI>Dee&s;e,</HI> which entreth the <HI>Maes,</HI> about two Leagues below it; one of the greate&s;t Cities in <HI>Brabant;</HI> and for its &s;trength, for which 'tis be|holden both to Nature and to Art, the States of the <HI>Uni|ted Provinces</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;s not any one more con&s;iderable, and is a very good Frontier again&s;t all Enemies on this &s;ide: It is encompa&s;&s;ed on all &s;ides with Fenns and Mar&s;hy Grounds. The <HI>Avenues</HI> to it are by narrow Cau&s;ies, made turning and winding, to be commanded in all pla|ces by one or other of the &s;ix Sconces or Forts built at &s;ome di&s;tance without the Town for its greater Security. Be&s;ides which, the Hollanders having &s;ome rea&s;on to be jealous of the Inhabitants, who&s;e affections might incline them towards the neighbouring Princes, of who&s;e Reli|gion mo&s;t of them are, they have built a Citadel within the Town, a Briel or pair of Spectacles to look more ac|curately into their Affairs. It is a hand&s;om regular Fort of five Ba&s;tions, each Curtain is 84 ordinary paces long; the Faces of each Ba&s;tion 63; and the Flank or Neck 24. There is a hand&s;ome Hou&s;e of Stone for the Centry
<PB N="24" REF="15"> at the point of each Ba&s;tion, and the middle of each Cur|tain, every one of which co&s;t Seven hundred Guldens.

<P>This City was made an Epi&s;copal See, 1559.

<P>This Town was taken from the King of <HI>Spain</HI> by the Forces of the Confederate E&s;tates, in the year 1628. af|ter a long and chargeable Siege; in which the little Sconce, one of the Forts towards the South, did excel|lent Service.</P>
<P>Divers of the Nuns were &s;till alive in this Town, but at <HI>Utretcht</HI> they were all dead.</P>
<P>From the <HI>Bo&s;che</HI> we travelled through a plain Country, &s;omewhat Sandy, to <HI>Breda</HI> upon the River <HI>Merck:</HI> A place very con&s;iderable, plea&s;antly &s;eated, and well|fortified. It hath formerly had more Outworks than at pre&s;ent: For they have taken away the Crown-works, and left only the Half-moons and Horn-works, and Con|&s;erves or Contregards about the Half-moons. There is a large Ditch of Water round the Counter&s;carp, and a &s;mall Ravelin between each Ba&s;tion, joyned to the Ram|part within &s;ide of the Ditch. There is al&s;o a double Haye or Quick&s;et-hedge almo&s;t quite round the Town, be|&s;ides Pali&s;ados. The <HI>Parapet</HI> is very thick, and &s;trengthned
<PB N="25" REF="15"> with a row of Elms, and &s;econded with another row at three or four yards di&s;tance, round the Town; the bo|dies of the <HI>Ba&s;tions</HI> are &s;unk down or h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">llowed away, and filled with a thicket of Elms.

<P>This Town belongeth unto the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> un|to whom it hath de&s;cended by the right of the hou&s;e of <HI>Na&s;&s;aw,</HI> by the Marriage of <HI>Engelbert</HI> the &s;eventh Earle of that hou&s;e, with <HI>Mary</HI> daughter and Heir of <HI>Philip</HI> the la&s;t Lord thereof, about the year 1400.

<P>Leaving <HI>Breda</HI> we &s;oon came by Land to St. <HI>Gertruyden|berg</HI> the la&s;t Town on the North of <HI>Brabant,</HI> where it joyneth to the Province of <HI>Holland,</HI> a &s;mall place, but a good Town for fi&s;hing, lying upon a Hill near the great broad Water called <HI>de Waert,</HI> made by the falling of the <HI>Maes</HI> and many other Rivers into it. This Town is fortified and Garri&s;oned. The Church and Steeple have been Large and fair, and the ruines of the latter are ob&s;ervable, in regard that this Steeple was &s;hot down by a Stratagem of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> while the Governour and chief of the Town were upon it, to ob&s;erve a fal&s;e a|larm in the Prince's Camp, and &s;o lo&s;t them&s;elves and the Town.

<P>In this Town are many fair hou&s;es and plea&s;ant Gar|dens. The great Church is large, the Steeple 312 &s;teps high; the top thereof being made of four large Dy|alls. There is al&s;o an Exchange or Place for Merchants to meet. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have two Churches, and the <HI>French</HI> one. The Key or Head to the water &s;ide is hand&s;ome, and the Country about very plea&s;ant; we &s;aw the Chamber wherein the <HI>Synod</HI> of <HI>Dort</HI> was a&s;&s;embled 1611. a large fair room; and took a collation in the &s;ame hou&s;e, in a high turret overlooking the Town and Coun|try: Our &s;eats Moving round about the Table continu|ally; &s;o as the diver&s;ity of the pro&s;pect made it more delightful.

We Land|ed at <HI>Ter-Vere,</HI> where there is a good Haven and Harbour for Ships, the Walls were built in the year 1357, to|wards the Sea are round towers. The <HI>Piazza</HI> is long. The <HI>Scotch</HI> have had a Factory here for above two hun|dred years, and the <HI>Marqui&s;s</HI> of this Place did formerly make one of the three States, by which <HI>Zealand</HI> was Go|verned.

<P><HI>Middleburg</HI> is the chief Town in the I&s;land <HI>Walachria,</HI> &s;eated almo&s;t in the middle of it, being well built, large, rich, and Populous, it is the fourth Port for the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> trade: hath a large, broad Water within the Town, and a &s;treight cut through the Land to carry Ve&s;&s;els out to Sea, the whole is very well Fortified, the Officers here are cho&s;en by Strangers or Foreigners, the Churches are many and remarkable, the new Church is of an eight|&s;quare figure with a <HI>Cupola,</HI> the Tower of the old great Church very high, the <HI>Stadthui&s;e</HI> with the old &s;tatuas, a|bout it, the round <HI>Piazza,</HI> and many private buildings are Con&s;iderable, and the whole Country about it is fruitful; either divided into Gardens and Orchards, or Planted with <HI>Madder, Pompions,</HI> or Grain and Fruits. The <HI>Zealanders</HI> are generally addicted to the intere&s;t of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and great Lovers of his Per&s;on. I found them not a little delighted that the Prince had been
<PB N="29" REF="17"> with them &s;ome days before, and was made <HI>Premier</HI> Noble, or chief of the States of <HI>Zealand;</HI> which was chiefly brought about, as I was informed, by <HI>Pen&s;ioner Hubert, Le Sage, Duvelaer</HI> and <HI>Vriebergen,</HI> formerly no great friends to the Prince, e&s;pecially <HI>Vriebergen,</HI> who was the mo&s;t earne&s;t of any to bring him in, in de&s;pite to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> for General <HI>Worts</HI> his &s;ake, who be|ing &s;et over the <HI>Zealand</HI> forces by tho&s;e of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> lately affronted <HI>Vriebergens</HI> Son who was a Colonel, at the head of his Regiment.

<P>Returning to <HI>Middleburg</HI> by Land I ob&s;erved there was a row of Trees round the Town between the moat and rampart, where ordinarily there is only a brea&s;t|worke or a hedge, and embarked at <HI>Middleburg</HI> again, and pa&s;&s;ed down the River by the fort <HI>Rammakins,</HI> and &s;o for the <HI>Schelde,</HI> Sayling up that noble River till we had pa&s;&s;ed the Fort <HI>Frederick Henrick</HI> and came to <HI>Lillo;</HI> where we &s;tayd till the Ve&s;&s;ell was &s;earched.

<P>The River <HI>Scaldis</HI> or <HI>Scheld</HI> mentioned by <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> is a gallant River, affording plenty of fi&s;h, and convenience

<P>The Walls of <HI>Antwerp</HI> are very large, faced with Brick and free&s;tone, having divrs rows of Trees upon them, broad walks, and conveniences for the Coaches, to make their tour upon. The <HI>Ba&s;tions</HI> are not &s;o large as generally they build now a dayes, yet after the modern way. The Ditch is very broad and deep, the Country about it, all Gardens. The <HI>Cittadel</HI> is a regu|lar fortification of five <HI>Ba&s;tions,</HI> wherein lies alwayes a Garri&s;on of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Soldiers: upon every curtain there are two mounts or Cavaliers; and between them below, a row of building or lodgings for the Soldiers; the ears of the <HI>Ba&s;tions</HI> are cut down, and <HI>Ca&s;amates</HI> made, and Pali&s;ados &s;et round upon the <HI>E&s;planade;</HI> the Walls are lined with excellent Brick and &s;tone, nor is there any where a more regular beautifull Fortification of five <HI>Ba|&s;tions</HI> that is fini&s;hed: it commands the City, the Ri|ver and the Country: be&s;ides this <HI>Cittadel</HI> there is ano|ther Fort within the Town near the <HI>Scheld,</HI> to command

<P>The Town-hou&s;e is fair, the Hou&s;e built for the Ea&s;t|country Merchants is very &s;tately and large, but runneth now to ruine, in this I &s;aw among other curio&s;ities, divers &s;trange Mu&s;ical in&s;truments, which at pre&s;ent are not under&s;tood, or at lea&s;t not made u&s;e of: The <HI>He&s;&s;en</HI> hou&s;e hath been al&s;o formerly con&s;iderable. The water which they make u&s;e of in Brewing, is brought by an Aqueduct from <HI>Herentall</HI> about thirty miles di&s;tant from hence; and is conveyed into the Town by a large Chan|nel, peculiarly walled in by it &s;elf where it pa&s;&s;eth the Ditch; in this City are many good Collections of Pict|ures both Ancient and Modern, and excellent Mini|ature or Limning by <HI>Gon&s;ol,</HI> one fine piece, which I

<P>From <HI>Antwerp,</HI> I pa&s;&s;ed to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> by water, chang|ing Boats five times, and going through divers locks, by rea&s;on that the Country is &s;o much higher about <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> and the water above two hundred foot lower at <HI>Antwerp.</HI> At <HI>Fontaine</HI> a league and half from <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> three Rivers cro&s;s one another: one of them being carried over a bridg. The <HI>Piazza</HI> of <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> is fair. and oblong in fi|gure upon one of the longe&s;t &s;ides &s;tands the Town|hou&s;e, and over again&s;t it the Kings-hou&s;e, where upon a Scaffold hanged with Velvet, Count, <HI>Fgmond</HI> and <HI>Horne</HI> were beheaded, the whole <HI>Piazza</HI> being hanged with Black Cloth. Upon the top of the Town-hou&s;e, &s;tand: St. <HI>Michael</HI> the Patron of the City in Bra&s;s, Count <HI>Mar&s;ins</HI> hou&s;e formerly belonging to the Prince of <HI>Orange;</HI> hath a fair Court, and overlooks a good part of the City, but a quarter of it is ruined by Lightning. The Thunder bolt or Stone which they affirm to have effected it, is bigger than two Mens heads, and hangs up upon the door at the entrance. The <HI>Ie&s;uites</HI> Church is hand&s;ome, and in it the fair white Tower is beautifully gilded at the top. The <HI>Carmelites</HI> Church hath a noble Altar, and near unto the Church is the <HI>Statua</HI> of a pi&s;&s;ing boy, which is a con|tinual Conduit. The Armory was well furni&s;hed, as we were informed, before the Governours of the low Coun|tries &s;old the Arms; and <HI>Ca&s;&s;el Roderigo</HI> the Governour left it very bare. There remains the Armour of <HI>Charls</HI> the fifth, of Duke <HI>Albert,</HI> of the Prince of <HI>Parma, Er|ne&s;tus,</HI> and of the Duke <HI>d'Alva</HI> and of the Duke <HI>Alberts</HI> hor&s;e who being &s;hot &s;aved his Ma&s;ter, and died the &s;ame day twelve month; Spears for the hunting the wild Boar, one with two Pi&s;tols; The Armour of Cardinal <HI>Infan|te,</HI> and of an <HI>Indian</HI> King; A <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> musket which carri|eth

<P>Somewhat like <HI>Godfrey</HI> of <HI>Bouillons</HI> &s;hooting the three Pigeons near the Tower of <HI>David,</HI> is the &s;hot which <HI>Infanta I&s;abella</HI> made, when with an Arrow &s;he killed a Bird, in memory whereof, a Bird pierced with an Ar|row is &s;et upon the top of a Tower in the Count, which is large; and if the New Buildings and De&s;ign were con|tinued, it would be very hand&s;ome. Before the Court &s;tand five bra&s;s Statues. The Park is plea&s;ant, with Trees &s;et in order, and adorned with Grotto's, Foun|tains, and Water-works, which come very near the <HI>Ita|lian;</HI> one piece &s;omewhat imitating <HI>Fra&s;cati,</HI> in which all Mu&s;ical In&s;truments are imitated, and a perpetual mo|tion attempted: and on the Front of the Buildings &s;tand the <HI>Cae&s;ars</HI> head. But the Eccho is mo&s;t remarkable; which may perfectly be di&s;tingui&s;hed to ten or twelve Replies. The greate&s;t Church is that of St. <HI>Gudula;</HI> in which is her Statua, the Devil &s;triving to blow out the Light of her Lanthorn. Two Chappels therein are re|markable; the one built by <HI>Leopoldus,</HI> very fair on the out&s;ide: the other towards the North, hath been vi&s;ited by five Kings, in which is the Ho&s;t which bled being &s;tabbed by the Jews. In the <HI>Dominican</HI> Church is the Monument of the Duke of <HI>Cleve</HI> and his Dutche&s;s, in <HI>Go|rinthian</HI> bra&s;s. But for a New Church that of the <HI>Be|gennes,</HI> or Pious Maids, is very con&s;iderable; there be|ing Eight hundred of them in this City, who have a par|ticular place allotted to them, where they have built this
<PB N="36" REF="21"> milk white Church. The Plague was much in this place at that time, three hundred Hou&s;es being &s;hut up, and a Garland placed on the doors, in the middle of which &dagger; was written IHS. I &s;aw the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nunnery, and o|ther con&s;iderable Buildings. And after I had refre&s;hed my &s;elf at the Fi&s;h-Tavern, which is worth the &s;eeing, e&s;pecially for two Rooms in it, furni&s;hed from top to bottom with very good Pictures, I returned to <HI>Ant|werp.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Octob.</HI> 4. I travelled through an open Country, and lodged at <HI>Molin bru&s;l&egrave;.</HI> The <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Souldiers met us upon the Road this day, &s;ome of them well mounted and armed, and begged of us, and were well &s;atisfied with a &s;mall Benevolence. The next day we entred the Country of <HI>Liege,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ed great Heaths, and on the Sixth, in the morning, arrived at <HI>Mae&s;treicht.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Trajectum ad Mo&s;am,</HI> or <HI>Mae&s;treicht,</HI> is a &s;trong Town, &s;eated upon the <HI>Maes,</HI> four Leagues below <HI>Liege.</HI> The Out-works are very con&s;iderable; the Wall is old. To|wards the South-ea&s;t lyeth a Hill, which ari&s;eth gently, and overlooks part of the Town. Under this Hill is one of the noble&s;t Quarries of Stone in the World. To &s;e|cure the Town from the di&s;advantage it might receive from this Hill, there was formerly a Fort built upon it, but it hath been long &s;ince &s;lighted; and they have made out an Horn-work within Musket-&s;hot of it, and the Ba|&s;tion an&s;wering to it is made very high, to cover the Town. On the other &s;ide of the River &s;tandeth <HI>Wicke,</HI> very well fortified al&s;o, and rather &s;tronger than <HI>Mae|&s;treicht,</HI> into which they might retire if the Town &s;hould be taken by Storm, it being united to <HI>Mae&s;treicht</HI> by a hand&s;ome Bridge over the <HI>Maes,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of Nine Ar|ches. All about <HI>Wicke</HI> the Country is flat: there are

<P>The private Hou&s;es of <HI>Mae&s;treicht</HI> are generally cove|red with a black Slat, or Ardoi&s;e, otherwi&s;e not very beautiful. The Town hou&s;e is fair, &s;eated in one of the <HI>Piazza's,</HI> built of white Stone; it hath Nine large Windowes in a row on each &s;ide, and within is very well painted by <HI>Theodorus van der Schuer,</HI> who was Painter to the Queen of <HI>Sweden.</HI> In another <HI>Piaz|za</HI> is a Fountain, rows of Trees, and the great Church. This Town was be&s;ieged and taken from the King of <HI>Spain</HI> by the Confederate States, in the year 1632.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> the Seventh I dined at <HI>Gallop,</HI> a &s;mall place, and came that night to <HI>Aken, Aix la Chapelle,</HI> or <HI>Aqui&s;|grane,</HI> an ancient noble City, the Inhabitants Courteous, and much frequented by rea&s;on of its hot Baths, of which I &s;hall &s;peak more particularly in my Journey from <HI>Colen</HI> to <HI>London.</HI> Leaving <HI>Aken</HI> I travelled to|wards <HI>Juliers</HI> or <HI>Gulick,</HI> but it being late before we arrived, the Gates were &s;hut up, &s;o as we went on|ly under the Walls, leaving it on our right hand. Near unto <HI>Gulick</HI> runneth a &s;hallow &s;wift River, called the <HI>Roer.</HI> At the Mouth of it, where it fal|leth into the <HI>Maes,</HI> is &s;eated a con&s;iderable Town, called <HI>Roermonde,</HI> through which I pa&s;&s;ed in the year 1673. when Sir <HI>Lionel Jenkins</HI> and Sir <HI>Jo&s;eph Wil|liam&s;on</HI> were &s;ent Plenipotentiaries to <HI>Cologne,</HI> in our Journey from <HI>Antwerp</HI> to that City.

<P><HI>_COlen, Coln,</HI> or <HI>Colonia Agrippina,</HI> was anciently the Capital City of the <HI>Ubii,</HI> a people who were at fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Countries now called <HI>Berg</HI> and <HI>March,</HI> but being over run by the <HI>Ger|mans</HI> next to them, <HI>Agrippa,</HI> Lieutenant of <HI>Gallia,</HI> received them into protecti|on, and placed them upon this &s;ide of the <HI>Roman</HI> &s;hoar of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> where they built this place, and called it <HI>Oppidum Ubiorum,</HI> and the <HI>Romans</HI> &s;eating them&s;elves here for the defence of the Country, in Honour of <HI>A|grippina,</HI> daughter to <HI>Germanicus,</HI> and wife to <HI>Claudius,</HI> who&s;e Birth-place it was, gave it afterwards the Name of <HI>Colonia Agrippina.</HI> It is at pre&s;ent one of the large&s;t, if
<PB N="40" REF="23"> not the greate&s;t, of any City in <HI>Germany,</HI> &s;ecured to|wards the Land by a high Wall, and two deep Trenches, and towards the Water by a Wall of Stone. The <HI>Rhine</HI> renders it delightful upon one &s;ide, and divers rows of Trees enclo&s;e the Town towards the Land. They have &s;ome Out-works, as Half-moons and Ravelins, but their be&s;t &s;ecurity is in the great number of men which they are able to rai&s;e within them&s;elves. Many of the Streets are broad, and paved with broad &s;tones.</P>
<P>It received the Chri&s;tian Faith very early, and <HI>Ma|ternus</HI> was their Bi&s;hop above 1350 years &s;ince, who &s;ub&s;cribed, among&s;t others, to the Council of <HI>Arles.</HI> They have a great number of Churches, and well endowed, which take up a great part of the Town; The Prebends and Canons Hou&s;es having in many places Vineyards, and large Gardens adjoyning. Towards the North end of the Town, the Church of St. <HI>Kunibald</HI> is con&s;iderable. The Convent of the <HI>Dominicans</HI> is fair, and newly built, with a Garden in the Court, and all the Chambers uniform. The Je&s;uites Church is well built and &s;tored with rich Copes, Altar-pieces, and other Ornaments. In the Church of St. <HI>Gereon,</HI> a Saint of great name here, marty|red about <HI>Colen</HI> in the time of <HI>Maximianus,</HI> are about a thou&s;and Saints heads, and on each &s;ide of the Altar a large Statua, whereof one is of a Moor; and under the Quire another Church. The Convent of the <HI>Carmelites</HI> is al&s;o con&s;iderable, wherein the Treaty of Peace was held with good accommodation in it, though with no &s;ucce&s;s, in the year 1673. In the Church of St. <HI>Ur&s;ula</HI> is her Tomb, and the Tombs of divers of the Eleven thou&s;and Virgins, martyred by the <HI>Huns.</HI> Upon the Monument of St. <HI>Ur&s;ula</HI> is this In&s;cription;

<PB N="41" REF="23"> Upon many of the Tombs which are old are Cro&s;&s;es and Lamps. Many Bones and Heads of the Martyrs are al&s;o kept in this Church. The Cathedral is dedicated to St. <HI>Peter,</HI> and is very large, but not fini&s;hed. The Body of the Church hath four rows of Pillars within it. The Quire is hand&s;ome and very high: behind it are believed to be the Tombs of the three Wi&s;e men which came from the Ea&s;t to wor&s;hip our Saviour, or the Kings of <HI>Arabia,</HI> of whom it was prophe&s;ied that they &s;hould bring Gifts, commonly called the three Kings of <HI>Colen: Melchior,</HI> who offered Gold, <HI>Ga&s;par</HI> Frankincen&s;e, and <HI>Baltha&s;ar</HI> Myrrhe. Their Bodies, as the account goeth, were fir&s;t removed to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> by <HI>Helena</HI> the Mother of <HI>Con|&s;tantine</HI> the Great; then to <HI>Milan</HI> by <HI>Eu&s;torfius</HI> Bi&s;hop thereof; and they have now re&s;ted at <HI>Colen</HI> for above five hundred years, being tran&s;lated from <HI>Milan</HI> hither by <HI>Rainoldus</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Colen,</HI> in the year 1164. There are al&s;o divers other Monuments of Bi&s;hops, and Noble Per&s;ons in Bra&s;s and Stone, and one in the &s;hape of a Ca&s;tle with &s;ix Towers. The Canons of this Church are all Noblemen; among whom the Duke of <HI>Newburg,</HI> who ordinarily re&s;ides at <HI>Du&s;&s;eldorff,</HI> about twenty <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> miles below this City, upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> hath two Sons. In a Church dedicated to all the Apo&s;tles, they &s;hew a Tomb, which being opened by Thieves, intending to plunder it, the woman buried in it aro&s;e up and went home, and lived with her Husband divers years after. In one of the Streets is a Tower, or rather one Tower upon another, which &s;eems to be ancient, now made a Pri&s;on. Upon another Ruine al&s;o in the Streets lies a Tombemade out of one Stone; of which &s;ort of Tombs there are ma|ny in this City and other places; but the greate&s;t number of them I ever &s;aw was at <HI>Arles</HI> in <HI>Provence.</HI></P>
<P>The Senate Hou&s;e is Noble, having a fair Tower upon
<PB N="42" REF="24"> it, from whence there is a good pro&s;pect over the City. Upon the Front of the Senate Hou&s;e is a Man in <HI>Ba&s;&s;o re|lievo,</HI> fighting with a Lyon, who, as it was related to me, was formerly one of the Con&s;uls, who having had a conte&s;t with &s;ome Clergy-men about the Government of the City, on a &s;uddain they cau&s;ed a Lyon to be let in up|on him: upon which occa&s;ion he behaved him&s;elf &s;o well, as he delivered him&s;elf, and &s;lew the Lyon.</P>
<P>The Elector or Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Colen</HI> hath two Palaces in the City, but by agreement between him and the Town, he is not to &s;tay here above three days together. Only this pre&s;ent Archbi&s;hop, upon the coming down of the Im|perial Forces, and his lo&s;s of <HI>Bonna,</HI> took Sanctuary here in the Convent of St. <HI>Pantaleon,</HI> where he continued a great while.</P>
<P>The City is Imperial and Free, and yet it doth Ho|mage to the Elector, much after this Form: <HI>We free Ci|tizens of</HI> Colen <HI>promi&s;e to the Archbi&s;hop, to be faithful and favourable unto him as long as he pre&s;erves us in Right and Honour, and in our ancient Priviledges, Us, our Wives, our Children, and our City of</HI> Colen. Mo&s;t of the City are of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, and the whole Town &s;o full of Convents, Churches, Church-men and Reliques, that it is not unde&s;ervedly &s;tyled the <HI>Rome of Germany.</HI> The <HI>Lutherans</HI> have al&s;o a Church within the Walls, and the <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> at <HI>Mulheim,</HI> half a League down the Stream on the other &s;ide of the <HI>Rhine.</HI></P>
<P>Over again&s;t <HI>Colen</HI> lieth <HI>D&uacute;tz,</HI> a &s;mall Village, inhabi|ted chiefly by Jews. The Ve&s;&s;els which come out of the <HI>Low-Countries</HI> hither are long, round bellied, and of great burden. Near to the Wall of the Town, upon the Quay or Key, is a kind of Harbour made for them, into which they may be drawn, and e&s;cape the Injuries they would otherwi&s;e &s;uffer by the Ice in Winter.</P>

<P>Be&s;ides the rich Clergy, there are many wealthy Citi|zens and Merchants here, and they maintain a Traffick and Corre&s;pondence with divers Countries, e&s;pecially by the convenience of the <HI>Rhine.</HI> They &s;peak not the be&s;t <HI>High-dutch;</HI> but <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>French</HI> are under&s;tood by many: Divers Ho&s;ts in Inns &s;peak <HI>Latin,</HI> and the Ser|vants <HI>French;</HI> which proves a good help unto Travellers.

It was not long &s;ince very well fortified by the order of the pre&s;ent Archbi&s;hop, and the direction of Colonel <HI>Bi|&s;er,</HI> a blind man, having <HI>Cataracts</HI> in both his eyes. The Archbi&s;hops Palace is very Noble, and there is a Cham|ber &s;eated a good way into the <HI>Rhine,</HI> to which they pa&s;s thorow a Gallery. This Night we lodged at the foot of the highe&s;t of the &s;even Hills by the <HI>Rhine,</HI> which are &s;een at a great di&s;tance; and upon divers of them &s;tand old ruined Ca&s;tles. On the <HI>15th</HI> we pa&s;&s;ed by a plea&s;ant I&s;land with a Convent in it: at <HI>Remagen</HI> is al&s;o a Con|vent upon a Rock, fortified with round Towers. In the Evening we lodged near to a Ca&s;tle, ruined four years before by the Electors of <HI>Triers</HI> and <HI>Colen,</HI> it belonging at that time to the Duke of <HI>Lorrain.</HI> On the <HI>16th</HI> early in the Morning we came to <HI>Andernach,</HI> where the plague was very much at that time, and they kept a great many of their &s;ick in Boats upon the <HI>Rhine.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Andernach,</HI> of old <HI>Antenacum,</HI> was one of the <HI>Roman</HI> Fortre&s;&s;es. Upon this River, &s;ome think that <HI>Caligula</HI> was born, and that <HI>Valentinian</HI> was buried hereabouts. Near unto this place are al&s;o Mineral Springs, well fre|quented, and much made u&s;e of.

<P>In places where the <HI>Rhine</HI> runneth through a low Coun|try and a fat Soyl, it wa&s;heth away the Banks: to &s;ecure which, in divers places they have made great Works of Wood, and al&s;o to &s;ecure Ve&s;&s;els from the danger of the Ice. And I remember, riding near the Banks of the Ri|ver <HI>Loire</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> I ob&s;erved them in &s;ome places to be hand&s;omly defended for a long way together with Free|&s;tone.</P>
<P>Near unto <HI>Coblentz,</HI> upon a Hill, is a Convent of <HI>Car|thu&s;ians. October</HI> the <HI>17th</HI> we went up the <HI>Rhine</HI> to <HI>Bop|part,</HI> a walled Town, upon the we&s;tern bank, where <HI>Van Trump</HI> was at that time: It is a very old Town, one of the <HI>Roman</HI> Fortre&s;&s;es again&s;t the <HI>Germans,</HI> called anci|ently <HI>Bodobriga;</HI> &s;ome would have it called <HI>Bopport</HI> from <HI>Beauport, Fair-haven,</HI> or <HI>Bonport,</HI> a good convenient place for Ve&s;&s;els to retire into, or to ride in.</P>
<P>On the <HI>18th</HI> we dined at St. <HI>Guer,</HI> a plea&s;ant Town belonging to the <HI>Landtgrave</HI> of <HI>He&s;&s;e,</HI> who hath a Ca&s;tle

The Queen of <HI>Sweden</HI> pa&s;&s;ing by this place, gave a great Silver Cup, out of which they now drink at this Ceremony. We lodged this night at <HI>We&s;el,</HI> a Town &s;ituated between a high Hill and the River, belonging to the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Triers.</HI> Here in the Market-place they &s;hew us the print of St. <HI>Huberts</HI> Hor|&s;es foot in a Free-&s;tone.</P>
<P>On the <HI>19th</HI> we came to <HI>Baccharach,</HI> or <HI>ad Bacchi aras,</HI> belonging to the Elector <HI>Palatine;</HI> a place famous for Ex|cellent Wines. We pa&s;&s;ed by an old Ca&s;tle &s;eated upon a Rock in the middle of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> being of an irregular figure, called <HI>Pfalts,</HI> where formerly the Prince <HI>Pala|tines</HI> of the <HI>Rhine</HI> were born, the Prince&s;&s;es being &s;ent hither to be brought to Bed. We came this night to <HI>Dreick&s;hau&s;en;</HI> the next day we went by a dangerous Pa&s;|&s;age, there being many Rocks under water, which cau&s;e the River to run very rapid and unequally. A little a|bove this we came to a round Tower, on a Rock in the <HI>Rhine,</HI> called the <HI>Mou&s;e-tower,</HI> built by <HI>Hatto</HI> Archbi|&s;hop of <HI>Mentz,</HI> in the year 900. who, as the Story goeth, in a time of great Scarcity, pretending to relieve the poor who wanted bread, invited them together into a Barn, where he burnt them all, &s;aying, <HI>They were like the Rats and Mice which would devour the Corn.</HI> After which he was &s;o per&s;ecuted with Rats and Mice, that to avoid them he cau&s;ed this Tower to be built in the middle of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> which did not avail him, for they followed him
<PB N="48" REF="27"> thither al&s;o, and at la&s;t devoured him.

<P><HI>Bing,</HI> or <HI>Bingium,</HI> was an old <HI>Roman</HI> Fortre&s;s upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> where the River <HI>Navus</HI> or <HI>Naw</HI> entreth into it; over which latter there is a hand&s;ome Stone-bridge: In this Town were many of the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI>'s Army &s;ick and wounded, who three weeks before had main|tained a fight again&s;t the Forces of the Elector <HI>Palatine,</HI> near this place.

<P>From <HI>Mentz</HI> I pa&s;&s;ed by water up the River <HI>Main,</HI> to <HI>Franckfort,</HI> a free City of the Empire, called <HI>Trajectum Franconum,</HI> a Pa&s;&s;age or Ford of the <HI>Franks,</HI> as &s;erving them for a Retreat, when they entred or returned from <HI>Gaul;</HI> at pre&s;ent <HI>Franckford</HI> upon the <HI>Main,</HI> to differ|ence it from <HI>Franckford</HI> upon the River <HI>Oder,</HI> which is an Univer&s;ity: It is a large Town, divided into two parts by the River; the le&s;&s;er called <HI>Saxonhau&s;en,</HI> or <HI>Saxon|hou&s;es,</HI> united to the other by a Stone-bridge over the <HI>Main,</HI> of twelve or thirteen Arches. It is a place of good Trade, and well &s;eated for it, as having the ad|vantage of the River <HI>Main,</HI> which pa&s;&s;eth by <HI>Bamberg, Schweinfurt, Wurtzburg, Guemund,</HI> or <HI>Gaudia mundi;</HI> and al&s;o the <HI>Tauber,</HI> and other Rivers running into it, af|fordeth conveniency for Commerce with the remoter parts of <HI>Franconia;</HI> and the <HI>Main</HI> running into the <HI>Rhine,</HI> makes a large communication both up and down that Stream.</P>
<P>But this place is mo&s;t remarkable for the Election of the Emperour, which, by the Laws of the <HI>Golden Bull,</HI> &s;hould be in this City, as al&s;o for two great Marts or
<PB N="51" REF="28"> Fairs kept in <HI>March</HI> and <HI>September;</HI> at which times there is an extraordinary concour&s;e of people from remote parts, in order to buying and &s;elling of &s;everal Commo|dities, e&s;pecially for Books, as well printed here as in other parts, whereof they afford two Catalogues every year, and have no &s;mall dealings that way, by the Fa|ctors of the <HI>Germans, Hollanders, Italians, French,</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h:</HI> although at other times their trading in Books &s;eems not great; for when I was there out of the time of the Mart, the <HI>Stationers</HI> Shops being &s;hut up, made but a dull &s;how. Here are al&s;o a great number of good Hor&s;es bought and &s;old: and on the North-&s;ide of the City there is a &s;pacious place for a Hor&s;e-Fair. The City is &s;trong and well fortified; and mo&s;t part of the Town are <HI>Luthe|rans.</HI> In the <HI>German</HI> wars, the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> having taken <HI>Hanaw,</HI> &s;ent a Me&s;&s;enger to <HI>Franckfort</HI> to know whether the City would peaceably and &s;peedily &s;et open their Gates unto him, and accept fairly of a Garri&s;on, or &s;tand to the hazard of a Siege: And although they were unwilling to yield, yet for fear of the wor&s;t, they con|&s;ented, That the King &s;hould have free pa&s;&s;age for his Army through the City; and that for the better a&s;&s;urance of it, &s;ix hundred of his men &s;hould be received for a Garri&s;on into <HI>Saxonhau&s;en;</HI> and al&s;o that the Magi&s;trates and People &s;hould take an Oath unto his Maje&s;ty. So that upon the <HI>17th</HI> of <HI>November,</HI> 1631. the King's Army pa&s;|&s;ed through <HI>Saxonhau&s;en</HI> over the Bridge, quite through the Town. Colonel <HI>Vitzthumb</HI> was left Governour in <HI>Saxonhau&s;en;</HI> and the King him&s;elf rode bare-headed through the Streets: and by his obliging behaviour did generally win the affections of the beholders; and three days after returned thither again with the <HI>Landtgrave</HI> of <HI>He&s;&s;en-Ca&s;&s;ell,</HI> and the <HI>Landtgrave</HI> of <HI>He&s;&s;en-Darm&s;tadt,</HI> where they met the Seventeen Earls of the <HI>Wetteraw,</HI> or

<P>In <HI>Saxonhau&s;en</HI> there is a Hou&s;e anciently belonging unto the Knights of the <HI>Teutonick</HI> Order, which hath the priviledge of a Sanctuary for Man-&s;layers and Bankrupts; but it is a &s;ecurity but for fourteen days. Upon this &s;ide there is the large&s;t portion of Land belonging to <HI>Franck|fort;</HI> on the other &s;ide very little.</P>
<P>This being a trading place, it is no wonder that there are &s;o many Jews in it; for a di&s;tinction they wear great Ruffs, their Sons Bonnets, and their Wives a peculiar dre&s;s of their Head.</P>
<P>The Collegiate Church of St. <HI>Bartholomew,</HI> where ma|ny of the Emperours have been crowned, is large, hath a high Steeple, and is built of a red &s;tone. There are divers hand&s;ome Fountains in the Town, and good Hou|&s;es; in one of the be&s;t of which liveth Mon&s;ieur <HI>Pierre Neufville,</HI> a great Merchant, and a civil worthy per&s;on, well known in mo&s;t places of Commerce; who obliged me with Letters to <HI>Venice,</HI> and other places.</P>
<P>From <HI>Franckfort</HI> I continued my Journey through the <HI>Berg&s;traes,</HI> pa&s;&s;ing by <HI>Darm&s;tadt,</HI> which belongs to one of the Brothers of the Hou&s;e of <HI>He&s;&s;en,</HI> commonly known by the name of the <HI>Landtgrave</HI> of <HI>He&s;&s;en Darm&s;tadt;</HI> and afterwards through a fruitful plain Country, in the &s;ight of Hills, and &s;ometimes near them: the whole Country planted with Wallnut-trees, Vines, Corn, and in &s;ome places with Tobacco; till I arrived at <HI>Heidelberg.</HI></P>
<P>In coming into this Town we pa&s;&s;ed over the River <HI>Neccar, Nicer,</HI> or <HI>Necarus,</HI> upon a Bridge covered over from one end to another, with a large Roof of Wood: in the &s;ame manner is the long Bridge covered at the en|trance of the City of <HI>Ale&s;&s;andria della paglia</HI> in <HI>Italy.</HI></P>

<P>The River <HI>Neccar</HI> ari&s;eth near the <HI>Sylva Martiana,</HI> now <HI>Swartzwald,</HI> or <HI>Black Fore&s;t,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ing through the Territories of the Duke of <HI>Wittenberg,</HI> runneth into the <HI>Rhine</HI> at <HI>Manheim:</HI> This, though none of the great|e&s;t, yet is a con&s;iderable River of <HI>Germany;</HI> and hath di|vers good Towns upon it and near it, as <HI>Sultz, Tubingen, Wirtingen, E&s;&s;ingen, Stutgard, Can&s;tat, Lauffen, Hallbrun, Heidelberg.</HI></P>
<P>There being wars at that time when I was in this Coun|try, between the Elector <HI>Palatine</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Lo|rain:</HI> The Elector re&s;ided for the mo&s;t part at <HI>Franken|dale,</HI> to be near his Forces.</P>
<P><HI>Heidelberg</HI> is &s;eated on the South-&s;ide of the River <HI>Neccar,</HI> between it and a ridge of high Hills, &s;o as it cannot well admit of a modern Fortification, or hope to be extraordinary &s;trong, as being over-looked by the ad|jacent Mountains: It lieth mo&s;t at length from Ea&s;t to We&s;t: It hath been an Univer&s;ity &s;ince the year 1346. at which time it was begun by <HI>Rupertus,</HI> Count <HI>Palatine,</HI> and at pre&s;ent is much frequented. In the great Church was kept the famous Library, which, after that the <HI>Spa|niards</HI> had taken this Town 1620. was carried to <HI>Rome,</HI> and added to the <HI>Vatican,</HI> where I &s;aw it in the year 1664. being placed upon one &s;ide of a very long Gallery be|longing to the <HI>Vatican</HI> Library; and the Duke of <HI>Urbin</HI>'s Library placed on the other&s;ide, over-again&s;t it: both which made a notable addition to the Papal Library. In this Church and the Church al&s;o of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> are divers Monuments of Princes of the <HI>Palatine</HI> Family, and of Learned and Famous Men. The <HI>French</HI> have a Church here, and the pre&s;ent Elector is of the Order of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t;</HI> and his Son a Mare&s;chal of <HI>France:</HI> and good <HI>French</HI> and <HI>High-dutch</HI> are both generally &s;poken here. The <HI>Lutherans</HI> have al&s;o a Church in this Town, by the
<PB N="54" REF="30"> favour of the pre&s;ent Elector; although he him&s;elf be a <HI>Calvini&s;t:</HI> and to expre&s;s his generous kindne&s;s the higher in this point, the fir&s;t Stone was laid by him&s;elf and his Son; and it is called the <HI>Church of Providence,</HI> according to the Elector's Motto, <HI>Dominus Providebit.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the Town-hou&s;e is a Clock with divers Moti|ons, and when the Clock &s;trikes, the figure of an Old man pulls off his hat, a Cock crows, and &s;hakes his wings, Souldiers fight with one another, and the like. The Prince's Stables for above a hundred Hor&s;es are &s;eat|ed upon the River very conveniently, but were fairer formerly, above half thereof having been ruined by the Imperiali&s;ts; as al&s;o divers of the Statues on the out|&s;ide of the Ca&s;tle, which is &s;eated high above the Town.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Elector is <HI>Carolus Ludovicus,</HI> Son to the King of <HI>Bohemia, Frederick</HI> the Fifth; he was born in the year 1617. and pa&s;&s;ed his Youth an Exile from his Fathers Kingdom and Electorate: and at the pacification at <HI>Prague</HI> 1635. he was excluded from any re&s;titution to be made to him. But at length, in the Treaty of <HI>Mun|&s;ter</HI> 1648. he was re&s;tored to the lower <HI>Palatinate,</HI> and 1652. returned to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Fortunes: a highly accompli&s;hed Prince, much honoured and beloved by his Subjects. In the year 1650. he married <HI>Charlotta,</HI> Daughter to <HI>William</HI> the Fifth, <HI>Landgrave,</HI> and to the famous <HI>Amelia Elizabeth, Landgrave&s;s</HI> of <HI>Ha&s;&s;ia;</HI> by whom he had the <HI>Chur</HI> Prince, or Electoral Prince <HI>Charles,</HI> and a Daughter, the Prince&s;s <HI>Charlotta Elizabetha;</HI> but up|on &s;ome di&s;content the Prince&s;s Electre&s;s &s;ince returned to her own Friends and Country.

<P>In his Palace or Ca&s;tle at <HI>Heidelberg,</HI> are divers things remarkable; a very great Tower to be equalled by very few; within which is a Theatre for Comedies. This was formerly called <HI>Trutzkai&s;ar,</HI> or the Tower that bad Defi|ance, or threatned the Emperor; but &s;ince the Re&s;taura|tion of the Elector, there are &s;ome Works drawn about it in the figure of a Star, and the old di&s;obliging Name is by Proclamation forbidden to be continued, and it is at pre&s;ent called the <HI>Stern&s;chanz,</HI> or the <HI>Star-fort.</HI> By it is a hand&s;ome Garden; in the Ditch whereof there was then kept a great Bear, and a very large Wolf. The Grotto's and Water-works are very hand&s;ome: they were al&s;o making divers others, having the advantage of the &s;ide of the Hill to bring down the water, and to make Grots and Caves in the Rock. Among&s;t other Fountains, that of the Lions head with a Frog in his Ear, is taken notice of. The Cellars are very large and cool, filled with Ve&s;&s;els of no ordinary &s;ize; yet incon&s;iderable, if com|pared to the great Tun kept in a great Building joyning to the Cellars; it was built by this pre&s;ent Elector's Or|der, 1664. and goeth far beyond any made before: It contains 204 Faiders and odd mea&s;ure, or about two hundred Tuns: in&s;tead of Hoops it is built with large knee Timber, like the ribs of a Ship, which are painted and carved, and have divers In&s;criptions upon them, and &s;upported by carved Pedi&s;tals. Upon one &s;ide of it is a hand&s;ome Stairca&s;e to a&s;cend to the top of the Ve&s;|&s;el; upon the top of which is a Gallery &s;et round with Balli&s;ters, three and forty &s;teps high from the ground.</P>
<P>About an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> mile from <HI>Heidelberg,</HI> between the Hills, is a &s;olitary place, where three large Streams or Springs gu&s;h out of the Mountain, and pre&s;ently fill five Ponds, have three hand&s;ome Ca&s;cates or Falls, and after run into the Plain, and are &s;trong enough in a

<P>While I was at <HI>Heidelberg,</HI> two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> men came kind|ly to me, Mr. <HI>Villers,</HI> and <HI>Timothy Middleton,</HI> belonging to <HI>Lobensfeldt Cloi&s;ter,</HI> a Convent formerly of the Je&s;u|its, but &s;ince let out to about an hundred <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who left their Country 1661. came up the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and by the permi&s;&s;ion of the Elector, &s;etled them&s;elves a few miles from hence, living altogether, men, women, and chil|dren, in one Hou&s;e; and having a community of many things: They are of a peculiar Religion, calling them|&s;elves Chri&s;tian Jews; and one Mr. <HI>Poole,</HI> formerly li|ving at <HI>Norwich,</HI> is their Head. They cut not their Beards, and ob&s;erve many other Ceremonies and Duties, which they either think them&s;elves obliged to from &s;ome Expre&s;&s;ions in the Old Te&s;tament, or from &s;ome New Ex|po&s;ition of their Leaders.</P>

<PB N="57" REF="31"> which ari&s;e in the Empire are determined, and the Electors and other Princes, in &s;ome tryals at Law, may be called hither. It is a &s;ettled Court, which <HI>Maximi|lian</HI> the Fir&s;t, for the better ea&s;e of all per&s;ons, placed fir&s;t at <HI>Worms,</HI> and not long after it was fixed at <HI>Spire,</HI> from whence it cannot be now removed, but by the con|&s;ent of all the E&s;tates. Things Cogno&s;cible in this Court are determined by an Imperial Judge, and &s;ealed with the Emperours Arms, &s;o that there lieth no appeal unto the Emperour.</P>
<P>Another day I went to <HI>Manheim,</HI> formerly a Village, &s;eated at the Confluence of the <HI>Rhine</HI> and <HI>Neccar;</HI> but walled about by the Elector <HI>Frederick</HI> the Fourth, and &s;ince is much encrea&s;ed; all the Streets being large and uniform, and a Noble Citadel built; within which, over|again&s;t the Gate, the Elector de&s;igns a Palace, the Model of which I &s;aw: and at pre&s;ent, on the right hand, there are three Pavilions of Lodgings: in one of which lodgeth the Elector <HI>Palatine;</HI> in another the Prince his Son; and in the third the Prince&s;s his Daughter: behind the&s;e there is a hand&s;ome Garden and Lodgings for <HI>Degen Felderen,</HI> the <HI>Churfur&s;ts</HI> Mi&s;tre&s;s. Here are &s;ome good Pictures, as a Head of <HI>Hans Holben,</HI> and a Landskip with the Sto|ry of the Union of the <HI>Swi&s;&s;ers.</HI> The Bridge over the Moat of the Citadel into the Town, is al&s;o remarkable, as having &s;ix Draw-bridges upon it, three great ones, and three &s;mall ones on the &s;ide. There are Pali&s;ado's all a|long the bottom, in the middle of the Ditch, and with|out upon the <HI>E&s;planade.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Heidelberg</HI> I travelled to <HI>Nurnberg</HI> in the Compa|ny of Captain <HI>Wagen&s;eyl,</HI> who had been in the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Hungarian</HI> wars, and was employed a little before in blowing up the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Laun&s;teyn,</HI> belonging to the E|lector <HI>Palatine,</HI> to prevent its &s;urpri&s;al by the Duke of
<PB N="58" REF="32"> <HI>Lorrain.</HI> He was then employed to rai&s;e a Company at <HI>Nurnberg,</HI> for the Service of the Elector <HI>Palatine.</HI> I had a good advantage in my Journey by his Company; for he travelled with Authority, and was a generous, knowing, and courteous per&s;on.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t day we travelled near to the <HI>Neccar,</HI> in &s;tony and rocky way; and it being dark before we came to <HI>Mo&s;pach,</HI> the Pea&s;ants conducted us from Village to Vil|lage with bundles of lighted Straw.</P>
<P>The next day we came to <HI>Poxberg,</HI> where there is an old Ca&s;tle, and in the afternoon reached <HI>Morkenthal,</HI> or <HI>Mergetheim,</HI> the Seat of the Grand Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Herrhn Deutchern,</HI> or the <HI>Teutonick Order.</HI> The Town is well|built, hath a fair <HI>Piazza,</HI> with a large Fountain in it, and a Statue of one of the Grand Ma&s;ters, with a long <HI>Corridore</HI> from his Palace. This Order hath been of great Fame, and hath had large Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, as may be &s;een in the exact Account of the <HI>Teutonick Knights</HI> of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> made out from the be&s;t Authors, by my worthy honoured Friend Mr. <HI>A&s;hmole,</HI> in his Noble De&s;cription of the Order of the Garter; and as <HI>Lewis du May,</HI> Coun&s;ellor unto the Duke of <HI>Wirtenberg,</HI> hath &s;et it down. <HI>For the Knights Templars and of St.</HI> John, <HI>having fought pro&s;perou&s;ly again&s;t the Infidels, rai&s;ed an Emulation in &s;ome</HI> German <HI>Gentlemen, who waited upon the Emperour</HI> Frederick <HI>the Fir&s;t, in his Expedition to the</HI> Holy Land, <HI>to take the</HI> Croi&s;ado. <HI>And becau&s;e they were in&s;talled in the Church and Ho&s;pital of St.</HI> Mary <HI>at</HI> Jeru&s;alem, <HI>they were called</HI> Marianites. <HI>Their Order differed nothing from tho&s;e above-mentioned, but in the form and colour of their Cro&s;s, and was approved by Pope</HI> Cele&s;tin <HI>the Third. Afterwards when</HI> Jeru&s;alem <HI>was ta|ken by</HI> Saladin, <HI>tho&s;e Knights betook them&s;elves to</HI> Ptole|mais, <HI>from whence the Emperour</HI> Frederick <HI>the Second, &s;ent them back into</HI> Germany, <HI>and employed them again&s;t the</HI>
<PB N="59" REF="32"> Pru&s;&s;ians <HI>and</HI> Livonians, <HI>who at that time were &s;till Pa|gans. But by the Valour and Piety of tho&s;e Knights, their Souls were brought into &s;ubjection to Chri&s;t, and their Bo|dies to the Order which began that war in the year 1220. a little while after the&s;e Knights found them&s;elves Ma|&s;ters of a Country of very large Extent, which obeyed the Order, till the year 1525. at which time</HI> Sigi&s;mond, <HI>King of</HI> Poland, <HI>gave the inve&s;titure of</HI> Pru&s;&s;ia <HI>unto</HI> Albert <HI>Mar|qui&s;s of</HI> Brandenburg. <HI>In the year 1563. the Great Ma|&s;ter became Secular again, and took a part of the Lands &s;ub|ject to the Order, with the name of Duke of</HI> Curland. <HI>And</HI> Livonia <HI>having been the Subject and Theatre of many wars between the</HI> Polanders, Mu&s;covites, <HI>and</HI> Swedes; <HI>the&s;e la&s;t did at length become Ma&s;ters of it, and have it in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;till. So that there is no more remaining of the</HI> Teutonick Order, <HI>but &s;ome Commanderies &s;cattered here and there in</HI> Germany. <HI>And the Great Ma&s;ter hath his Seat and Re&s;i|dence at</HI> Mergenthal.</P>
<P>They wear on a white Mantle a plain black Cro&s;s. The Dignity of Grand Ma&s;ter is generally held by &s;ome Great and Honorable Per&s;on; and in the Great A&s;&s;embly he ta|keth place of all Bi&s;hops. The pre&s;ent is the Baron of <HI>Am|ring;</HI> and the Grand Ma&s;ter before him was <HI>Leopold Wil|liam,</HI> only Brother to the Emperor <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Third.</P>
<P>From hence we travelled to <HI>Lauterbach,</HI> near which we pa&s;&s;ed through a Wood, and found a Noble Church up|on the top of a high Hill, which being much frequented by Pilgrims, they have made hand&s;ome &s;tone Stairs from the bottom to the top: then to <HI>Rotenburg,</HI> and lodged at <HI>Burgperner,</HI> and the next day by <HI>Schantzbach</HI> we came to <HI>Nurenberg. Rotenburg</HI> is an Imperial City, which &s;ome have likened unto <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> for its Situation upon hilly places, and many Turrets in it. It is Situated near
<PB N="60" REF="33"> the head of the River <HI>Tauber,</HI> which may be accounted the &s;econd River of <HI>Franconia,</HI> pa&s;&s;ing by <HI>Rottingen, Lan|den,</HI> and <HI>Werthaim,</HI> where it runneth into the <HI>Main.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nurenberg</HI> is the faire&s;t City that I &s;aw in <HI>Germany;</HI> the Hou&s;es mo&s;t of them of Free-&s;tone, very high; and divers of them painted on the out&s;ide, and adorned with gilded Balls on the top; many are of &s;ix or &s;even Stories high. <HI>Der Herr Peller</HI> hath one of the faire&s;t. The City is very populous and full of Trade, although it &s;tands in a barren Country, and wants a Navigable River. The three be&s;t Churches are the <HI>Ho&s;pital Church,</HI> lately built very fair; St. <HI>Laurence,</HI> which is very large, with two high Steeples in the Front; and St. <HI>Sebald</HI> the be&s;t of the three. The Body of St. <HI>Sebald</HI> being laid upon a Cart drawn with Oxen, in that place where the Oxen &s;tood &s;till, they buried the Body, and erected this Church in his memory. In this Church is a Crucifix of Wood, very well carved, and e&s;teemed at a high rate. The Cru|cifix without the Church is very great, and of a black colour: and &s;ome fancy that the <HI>Raht Herrn,</HI> or Magi|&s;trates of the Town, have repo&s;ited a Trea&s;ure within it. The Pulpit is well carved and gilded, and the whole Church &s;o &s;tately, that it may pa&s;s in the fir&s;t rank of <HI>Lutheran</HI> Churches; that Religion being here practi&s;ed in its &s;plendour. The Prie&s;t every morning reads the Scripture to the people for half an hour, or preacheth a Sermon. The Town-hou&s;e is well worth the &s;eeing: In it the Hall is &s;pacious, as al&s;o the Chambers, and furni&s;h|ed with good Pictures, and Stones well gilded and pain|ted with white and gold, green and gold, dark coloured and gold, and the like. There is one Picture of mo&s;t of the Great Per&s;ons in <HI>Germany</HI> entertained in the Great Hall; another of the three Brothers of <HI>Saxony;</HI> one of an Elephant as big as the life; a piece of St. <HI>John</HI> and
<PB N="61" REF="33"> St. <HI>Mark,</HI> and another of St. <HI>Peter</HI> and St. <HI>Paul,</HI> both by <HI>Albert Durer:</HI> but the mo&s;t rare piece is that of <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> by the &s;ame Ma&s;ter, with this In&s;cription:
<Q>Albertus Durer Almang faciebat po&s;t Virginis partum, 1507.</Q> Another excellent one is that of St. <HI>Luke</HI> drawing the Picture of our Saviour and the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin. Over the Gate at the entrance of the Shambles is a large Oxe carved in Wood, and painted over, with this In&s;crip|tion:</P>
<Q><L><HI>Omnia habent ortus &s;uaque incrementa, &s;ed ecce</HI></L>
<L><HI>Quem cernis, nunquam Bos fuit hic, Vitulus.</HI></L></Q>
<P>The Ca&s;tle &s;tandeth upon a high Hill, from whence the Town makes a hand&s;ome &s;how: In it are ob&s;ervable a very deep well, the Emperors Chappel, his Picture, and the Pictures of the Electors; good Night pieces; and one of a man behind a white Curtain tran&s;parent, very well expre&s;&s;ed. The Armour of <HI>Hebbele van Gailinghen</HI> the great Sorcerer is here &s;hown; and in the Wall of the Ca|&s;tle the marks of his Hor&s;es feet, when he leaped from thence over the <HI>Town ditch.</HI></P>
<P>The new Fountain was not then fini&s;hed; but the Sta|tua's in Bra&s;s made for it were excellent; the Sea-Hor&s;es large, the Sea-Nymphs much bigger than the life; and <HI>Neptune,</HI> who was to &s;tand on the top, is above three yards and a half high. When I came fir&s;t into this place, I was not a little &s;urprized to behold the fairne&s;s of the Hou&s;es, hand&s;ome Sreets, different Habits, indu&s;trious People, and neatne&s;s in all things, more than I had ob|&s;erved in <HI>German</HI> Cities before; and no place hath grea|ter number of curious Artificers in Steel, Bra&s;s, Ivory,
<PB N="62" REF="34"> Wood, wherein they work at an extraordinary cheap rate; and there are Officers to in&s;pect and enquire into the works of Artificers, that they be true, perfect, and without fraud: they make &s;trong and hand&s;ome Clock|work. The King of <HI>Poland</HI> pre&s;ented the Grand Signi|or with a very noble Clock, who took &s;o much delight in it, that when it required &s;ome mending (the <HI>Turks</HI> be|ing ignorant in Clock-work) he &s;ent it from <HI>Adrianople</HI> as far as <HI>Nurenburg,</HI> to be &s;et in order again.</P>
<P><HI>Gu&s;tavus Adolphus,</HI> King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> was more magnifi|cently received and entertained in this City, than in any other of <HI>Germany;</HI> which &s;o incen&s;ed <HI>Wallen&s;teyn,</HI> that he afterwards encamped before their Town, and did great &s;poil upon their Territories: But the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> marched thither towards their Relief, and from thence towards <HI>Lutzen,</HI> where in a bloody Battel he lo&s;t his life.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Pegnitz</HI> runneth through <HI>Nurnberg,</HI> and hath divers Stone Bridges over it; and below the Town, joyning with the River <HI>Rednitz,</HI> runneth into the River <HI>Main</HI> at <HI>Bamberg;</HI> and the <HI>Main</HI> runs at la&s;t into the <HI>Rhine.</HI> The <HI>Reduitz</HI> ari&s;eth at <HI>Wei&s;senberg,</HI> and is not far from the River <HI>Altmul,</HI> which runneth into the <HI>Da|nube,</HI> towards <HI>Regen&s;burg.</HI> Upon this convenience, <HI>Charles</HI> the Great de&s;igned to make a Communication of pa&s;&s;age between the <HI>Danube</HI> and the <HI>Rhine;</HI> and made a <HI>Canale</HI> thirty paces broad between the <HI>Rednitz</HI> and the <HI>Altmul,</HI> to joyn tho&s;e Streams for the commodity of Pa&s;|&s;age by Boat; but after he had proceeded two <HI>German</HI> miles in this work, Boggs, Rains, and his warlike Di|ver&s;ions made him give over that noble De&s;ign, whereby there might have been a Commerce by water, from the <HI>Low-Countries</HI> to <HI>Vienna,</HI> and even unto the <HI>Euxine Sea.</HI></P>
<PB N="63" REF="34">
<P>The <HI>Roman</HI> Lieutenant in <HI>Nero</HI>'s time, had a de&s;ire to unite the River <HI>Soane</HI> and the <HI>Mo&s;ella;</HI> and to make a pa&s;&s;age between the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> and the <HI>German</HI> Oce|an; having been at the mouth of the <HI>Mo&s;ella</HI> by <HI>Coblentz,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ed from <HI>Chaalon</HI> upon the &s;oft and noble River <HI>Araris</HI> or <HI>Soane</HI> unto <HI>Lyon,</HI> I cannot but think the&s;e ve|ry goodly Streams, and fit for &s;uch a purpo&s;e. The pre&s;ent King of <HI>France</HI> hath a de&s;ign to unite the River <HI>Aude</HI> with the <HI>Garonne,</HI> and &s;o to have a pa&s;&s;age by Boat from the <HI>Mediterranean Sea</HI> by <HI>Tholou&s;e</HI> and <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> into the Ocean. When I travelled in tho&s;e parts, view|ing the Country well, I thought it would be a difficult work, and &s;o it proveth: but the King hath proceeded already very far therein.</P>
<P>About four Leagues from <HI>Nurnberg</HI> lyeth <HI>Altdorff,</HI> be|longing unto it, made an Univer&s;ity in the year 1623. con|taining, when I was there, about 150 Scholars. The Phy&s;ick Garden is hand&s;ome, and well &s;tocked with Plants, to the number of two thou&s;and. Dr. <HI>Hoffman</HI> the <HI>Botanick</HI> and <HI>Anatomick Profe&s;&s;our,</HI> &s;hew'd me many of the mo&s;t rare of them; and pre&s;ented me with divers. The <HI>Anatomy</HI> School is not large; yet the only one in tho&s;e parts of <HI>Germany:</HI> And they have divers Curio&s;ities pre|&s;erved in it, as the <HI>Skeleton</HI> of a Hart, of a Hor&s;e, of a Man, of a Bear bigger than a Hor&s;e: And &s;ome Pictures, as one of a <HI>Ninivite,</HI> and another of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> which they take to be Ancient. Dr. <HI>Wagen&s;eyl,</HI> Profe&s;&s;our of Law and Hi&s;tory, brother to Captain <HI>Wagen&s;eyl,</HI> who travel|led with me from <HI>Heidelberg,</HI> invited us to lodge at his Hou&s;e, and &s;hew'd me his Library, and all his Rarities and Coyns, whereof he hath a good Collection, having lived in mo&s;t places of <HI>Europe,</HI> and &s;peaks many Lan|guages well; he gave me a piece of the fir&s;t mony that was coined in <HI>Germany.</HI> In the Univer&s;ity Library I

<P>At <HI>Nurnberg</HI> I met with the Son and the Secretary to the <HI>Holland</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador in <HI>Turky,</HI> who had travelled hi|ther over-land from <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> in their return into the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> travelling in <HI>Greek</HI> Habits.</P>
<P>From hence I went to <HI>Newmarkt,</HI> a good Town in the upper <HI>Palatinate</HI> belonging to the Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> and the next day through <HI>Heinmaw,</HI> &s;ubject to the Duke of <HI>Newburg,</HI> to <HI>Regensburg.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rati&s;bona, Regen&s;burg, Augu&s;ta Tiberii, Colonia Quarta|norum,</HI> the chief place of the <HI>Roman</HI> Forces in this limit of the Empire, where the fourth <HI>Italick</HI> Legion had a con&s;tant &s;tation; was made a Colony by <HI>Tiberius</HI> in the year, as &s;ome conceive, of the Pa&s;&s;ion of our Saviour. It was much augmented and adorned by the Emperour <HI>Arnulphus,</HI> who had a great affection for this place, &s;o plea&s;antly &s;eated, and in a good Country. Here the River <HI>Regen</HI> runs into the <HI>Danube;</HI> from whence it was called <HI>Regen&s;burg.</HI> There are two Bridges, one of wood below the Town, and another Bridge of &s;tone of about fifteen Arches; which is the faire&s;t &s;tone Bridge o|ver the <HI>Danube.</HI> It is an Imperial City, but not with|out &s;ome acknowledgment to the Duke of <HI>Bavaria:</HI> And although it be &s;trongly fortified, yet it was taken by the <HI>Swedes</HI> in the <HI>German</HI> wars. There are many fair build|ings in it, both private and publick; and though I am not able to confirm what &s;ome report, that there as many Churches and Chappels in this City, as there are dayes in the year; yet are there many fair Churches and Convents: As the Cathedral of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> in the South-&s;ide of which is the Picture of St. <HI>Peter</HI> in a &s;hip; and on the North a|other of the Apo&s;tles fir&s;t Mi&s;&s;ion. In the <HI>Piazza</HI> &s;tands a neat little Church, the Convent of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> founded
<PB N="65" REF="35"> by St. <HI>Wolfgangus</HI> Bi&s;hop of this place, the Convent of St. <HI>Emerammus</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Rati&s;bone,</HI> a Saint of great Ve|neration here, though but of little mention or name in o|ther parts. The name of <HI>Albertus Magnus,</HI> Bi&s;hop of this place, hath al&s;o added unto the Fame of <HI>Regen&s;burg.</HI></P>
<P>But that which chiefly promoteth its lu&s;tre, is the General Diet or Parliament, which is often held in this City, and is not to be called in any part out of <HI>Germany;</HI> and the place is not unfit for the accommodation of &s;uch a noble Convention, as are the E&s;tates of <HI>Germany.</HI> The Vice-Mar&s;hal taketh care to provide Lodgings re&s;pe|ctively to their per&s;ons, and &s;eeth that all things be brought hither, and at a ju&s;t price; that the Hall or Place of A&s;&s;embly be furni&s;hed and adorned &s;utably to the dignity of the Per&s;ons convened, and hath an e&s;peci|al eye and regard towards the Publick &s;afety. By this Convention the great Concerns of <HI>Germany</HI> are much &s;ecured, and their peace and quiet E&s;tabli&s;hed. Wherein <HI>Germany</HI> &s;eems to have a better advantage than <HI>Italy;</HI> For <HI>Italy</HI> being likewi&s;e divided into many Dominions and Principalities, hath no Common Diet or Great Council, whereby to proceed for their Publick &s;afety: Which makes them often &s;o divided in their common Concerns in times of Danger, and when they mo&s;t need a joynt Combination.</P>
<P>I entred the notable River <HI>Danubius</HI> at this place, which hath already run a good cour&s;e, and pa&s;&s;ed by ma|ny fair Towns or Cities; as the large City of <HI>Ulme</HI> in <HI>Swabenland,</HI> where it beginneth to be Navigable; as al&s;o <HI>Donawert, Neuburg,</HI> and <HI>Ingol&s;tadt,</HI> and hath already received the con&s;iderable River of <HI>Licus</HI> or <HI>Leck,</HI> where|by the Commodities of that great Trading City of <HI>Aug&s;|burg</HI> are brought into it. When I fir&s;t embarked at <HI>Re|gen&s;burg,</HI> I thought I might have taken leave of the <HI>Da|nube</HI>
<PB N="66" REF="36"> not far below <HI>Vienna,</HI> but an opportunity made me &s;ee this great Stream beyond <HI>Belgrade,</HI> as I have declared in another Account of my Travels.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t day we pa&s;&s;ed by <HI>Thonaw&s;teyn,</HI> where there is a Ca&s;tle &s;eated upon a high Rock, and came to <HI>Pfeter</HI> or <HI>Vetera Ca&s;tra</HI> of old, now but an ordinary place. The Boats upon the <HI>Danube</HI> are generally painted black and white, are flat bottom'd, and broad at the Head and Stern; there is a Chamber built in the middle; and the Rudder is very large, to be able to command the Boat where the River is rapid, and of a &s;wift Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The next day we came to <HI>Straubing,</HI> a hand&s;ome walled Town, belonging to the Duke of <HI>Bavaria;</HI> the Streets are &s;treight; and there is a Tower in the Market-place, painted all over with green and gold-colour: There is al&s;o a Bridge of wood over the <HI>Danube.</HI> We pa&s;&s;ed by <HI>Swartz</HI> in the Afternoon, where the Church is &s;eated up|on a Hill, and is frequented by Pilgrims, and lodged at <HI>Deckendorff,</HI> where there is another Bridge. Near this Town comes into the <HI>Danube</HI> that con&s;iderable River <HI>I&s;er,</HI> or <HI>I&s;ara,</HI> having pa&s;&s;ed by divers con&s;iderable Towns; as <HI>Land&s;hut, Fri&s;ing,</HI> and <HI>M&uuml;nchen,</HI> the Seat of <HI>Ferdinan|dus Maria,</HI> Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> Great Steward of the Empire, and at pre&s;ent the fir&s;t of the Secular Electors, and he is to take place immediately after the King of <HI>Bo|hemia,</HI> it being &s;o concluded on at the Treaty of <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> where <HI>Maximilian</HI> Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> was allowed to hold the Elector&s;hip, which was confirmed upon him by the Emperour <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Second, when he excluded <HI>Frederick</HI> the Fifth, Count <HI>Palatine,</HI> and in lieu hereof there was an eighth Elector&s;hip erected for the <HI>Palatinate</HI> Family, who al&s;o, if the <HI>Bavarian</HI> branch doth fail, are to re-enter into their ancient Elector&s;hip, and the other newly erected is to be aboli&s;hed.</P>

<P><HI>Thur&s;day, November</HI> the fifteenth, we came by <HI>Wil&s;ho|ven</HI> to <HI>Pa&s;&s;aw, Patavia,</HI> or <HI>Boiodurum,</HI> a long and no|ble City in the lower <HI>Bavaria,</HI> or <HI>Bayern,</HI> made up of three Towns, <HI>Ilt&s;tadt, Pa&s;&s;aw,</HI> and <HI>Inn&s;tadt,</HI> at the con|currence of the River <HI>Inne,</HI> the <HI>Danube,</HI> and the <HI>Iltz.</HI> As Towns are commonly of great Antiquity which are built at the Confluence of great Rivers, for the Strength of the Situation and convenience of Commerce; &s;o is this accounted ancient, as being a <HI>Roman</HI> Co|lony, and the place of the <HI>Ca&s;tra Batava</HI> in old times.</P>
<P>The Church of St. <HI>Stephen</HI> is &s;tately, be&s;ides other fair Churches. The Bi&s;hop, who is Lord of the City, hath a &s;trong Palace upon a Hill; his Revenues are large, and be&s;ides what he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth hereabouts, he hath the tenth part of the notable great Lead-Mine at <HI>Bleyberg</HI> in <HI>Carinthia.</HI> This place had lately &s;uffered much by fire; but a good part was rebuilt, and very fairly after the <HI>Italian</HI> manner: So that this may well be reckoned as one of the ten con&s;iderable Cities, which are upon the <HI>Danube,</HI> accounting from <HI>Ulme</HI> unto <HI>Bel|grade,</HI> as <HI>Ulme, Ingol&s;tadt, Rati&s;bone, Pa&s;&s;aw, Lintz, Vienna, Pre&s;burg, Strigonium, Buda, Belgrade;</HI> all which from <HI>Rati&s;bone</HI> I had the opportunity to &s;ee be|fore the end of my Journey.

<P><HI>_VIENNA,</HI> or <HI>Wien,</HI> which the <HI>Turks</HI> call <HI>Berch,</HI> is the chief City of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> in the Latitude of forty eight Degrees, twenty Minutes, not much differing from the Latitude of <HI>Paris.</HI> The old Seat of the Dukes of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> and for a long time of the Emperours of <HI>Germany.</HI> Ac|cording to ancient account it &s;tandeth in <HI>Pannonia &s;upe|rior,</HI> the Bounds of <HI>Pannonia</HI> extending unto <HI>Kalemburg,</HI> or <HI>Mons Cetius,</HI> five or &s;ix miles We&s;tward of <HI>Vienna;</HI> beyond which &s;till We&s;tward all that lieth between that Hill and the great River <HI>Oenus,</HI> or <HI>Inne,</HI> which runneth into the <HI>Danube</HI> at <HI>Pa&s;&s;aw,</HI> or <HI>Ca&s;tra Batava,</HI> was anci|ently called <HI>Noricum.</HI></P>
<P>It was an ancient place of Habitation in the time of the <HI>Romans,</HI> and called <HI>Vindobona,</HI> as the Learned <HI>Petrus Lambecius</HI> hath at large declared, where the <HI>Cla&s;&s;is I&s;trica</HI>
<PB N="72" REF="40"> &s;ometimes lay, and the tenth <HI>German Legion</HI> had its &s;ta|tion; all this &s;hoar or &s;ide of the <HI>Danube</HI> being famous for the actions of <HI>Roman</HI> Emperours again&s;t the <HI>Marco|manni</HI> and <HI>Quadi,</HI> who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Country on the o|ther &s;ide of the River, and e&s;pecially for the wars of <HI>Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Philo&s;ophus,</HI> who notably de|feated tho&s;e Nations, and who, as <HI>Aurelius Victor</HI> (who was Governour of <HI>Sirmium</HI> in <HI>Pannonia inferior,</HI> in the time of <HI>Con&s;tantius</HI>) affirmeth, fell &s;ick at <HI>Carnuntum,</HI> now <HI>Petronel,</HI> and died at <HI>Vindobona,</HI> now <HI>Vienna.</HI> And to confirm the Antiquity hereof, be&s;ides what <HI>Wolfgangus Lazius</HI> hath delivered, not many years &s;ince &s;ome Anti|quities were found. For in the year 1662. when a wall was digged up near the old Palace, the workmen digging &s;till on below the Foundation, found a Stone Trough or Coffin, containing hard Earth and Bones, with a &s;mall Gold Coyn, a Gla&s;s Urn enclo&s;ed in a Bra&s;s one, an Iron Knife like a <HI>Sice&s;pita,</HI> or Knife u&s;ed about Sacrifices, a little Roll or Scroll of pure Gold, &s;hut up with a Gol|den cover at both ends, wherein was an In&s;cription in &s;trange Characters: Not far from the Sepulchral Monu|ment were found a Head in Bra&s;s, a Brazen <HI>Patera,</HI> Lamps, Lachrymatories, and other Ve&s;&s;els, and a Copper Coyn of <HI>Antoninus Caracalla.</HI> The writing in the Golden Scroll, which no man could read, was conceived by the Learned <HI>Lambecius</HI> to be the old <HI>Pannonian</HI> Character, and that this might be the Monument of &s;ome <HI>Pannonian</HI> Prie&s;t in the days of <HI>Caracalla,</HI> who, as good Authors deliver, &s;pent &s;ome time about the&s;e parts.</P>
<P>It is &s;eated on the South-&s;ide of the <HI>Danube,</HI> on the <HI>ripa Romana,</HI> that &s;ide neare&s;t to <HI>Rome,</HI> and many <HI>Roman</HI> Colonies, according to the u&s;ual po&s;ition of <HI>Roman</HI> Sta|tions, both upon this River and the <HI>Rhine,</HI> as may be ex|emplified in <HI>Colen, Bonna, Andarnach, Coblentz, Ments,
<PB N="73" REF="40"> Wormes, Spier,</HI> and <HI>Stra&s;burg.</HI> And in like manner in the old <HI>Roman</HI> Stations, on the South or <HI>Roman</HI> &s;ide of the <HI>Danube,</HI> which were in no &s;mall number in or near the <HI>Au&s;trian</HI> &s;hoar, as <HI>Carnuntum,</HI> or <HI>Petronel, Vi&s;chmund,</HI> or <HI>Aquinoctium, Eber&s;dorff,</HI> or <HI>Ala Nova, Melck,</HI> or <HI>No|male, Arlape,</HI> or <HI>Pechlarne, Lentia,</HI> or <HI>Lintz;</HI> for here|by they better &s;ecured their Conque&s;ts, and hindred the incur&s;ions of the Barbarians before them.</P>
<P>It is not &s;eated upon the main &s;tream of the <HI>Danube,</HI> but by a branch thereof; for the River running through a low Country; it is divided into &s;everal Streams, and maketh many I&s;lands. A &s;mall River named <HI>Wien,</HI> run|neth by the Ea&s;t part of this City, and entreth the <HI>Da|nube</HI> below it, which upon floods doth often much hurt, yet &s;ometimes low and very &s;hallow, &s;o as I have &s;tepped over it; &s;ome will have it to give the Name unto this Ci|ty: it divideth part of the Suburbs from it, and hath divers Bridges over it. For that we may have a di&s;tinct apprehen&s;ion of <HI>Vienna,</HI> we mu&s;t con&s;ider the City and Suburbs thereof; the Suburbs are very great, and not without fair Hou&s;es, Gardens, Walks, and all Accommo|dations at large.</P>
<P>The City it &s;elf is that walled and fortified part, de|&s;igned not only for convenience of Habitation, but al&s;o to &s;u&s;tain a Siege, or any Attack from the <HI>Turk,</HI> and is now &s;eparated from the Suburbs by a fair <HI>E&s;planade,</HI> or open Ground, above a Musket &s;hot over. The Hou&s;es near the wall were pulled down &s;ince the la&s;t Fortificati|on in the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> war, when they were in &s;ome fear that the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Forces about <HI>Gran</HI> and <HI>New-heu&s;el,</HI> would move towards them. It is fortified <HI>a la moderna,</HI> with ten Ba&s;tions towards the Land, and a very deep Ditch, into which they can let the <HI>Danube:</HI> and with two other Ba&s;tions towards the water, on that part of the River
<PB N="74" REF="41"> which lieth on the North-&s;ide of the Town. The Ba&s;tions are large; upon one of them I &s;aw Count <HI>Souches</HI> mu&s;ter a good part of the Militia of the City. The Ditch is large and very deep, into which although they can let in the River, yet it is commonly kept dry, le&s;t they might incommode their deep Cellars. There are two walls, the one old and inward, little con&s;iderable at pre&s;ent, built at fir&s;t with the ran&s;ome of our King <HI>Richard</HI> the Fir&s;t, who in his return from the Holy War, was detained Pri&s;oner by the Duke of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> upon the <HI>20th</HI> of <HI>Decem|ber,</HI> 1192. The <HI>Au&s;trians</HI> pretending they had received &s;ome affront from the King at <HI>Joppa,</HI> and that he had taken down the En&s;ign and Banner of Duke <HI>Leopold</HI> in a con|temptuous way. The other outward of a great breadth, made of Earth, and faced with Brick, edged with Free|&s;tone, &s;o well built, as to render this City one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable fortified places in <HI>Europe.</HI> The <HI>E&s;pla|nade</HI> gently de&s;cendeth from the Town for three hundred Paces; there are very few Out-works.</P>
<P>It is very uncertain who was the fir&s;t Builder of <HI>Vien|na,</HI> and after it had been long built, it ran to decay a|gain for Four hundred years together, till <HI>Henry</HI> the Fir&s;t, Duke of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> in the year 1158. did much re|pair it; and the ran&s;ome afterwards of King <HI>Richard</HI> beautified it.</P>
<P>The whole compa&s;s, taking in the Suburbs, makes a very large Circuit, but the City it &s;elf, which is walled in, may be about three miles in Circumference, and is exceeding populous, as full of People, for the bigne&s;s of the place, as mo&s;t of the great Cities. And I could not but take delight to behold &s;o many Nations in it, as <HI>Turks, Tartars, Graecians, Tran&s;ylvanians, Sclavonians, Hunga|rians, Croatians, Spaniards, Italians, French, Germans, Polanders, &amp;c.</HI> all in their proper Habits.</P>

There is al&s;o a Bridge within the City of <HI>Vi|enna,</HI> called the <HI>Hochbrug,</HI> or <HI>High-bridge,</HI> which is made by the cro&s;&s;ing of two Streets at equal Angles; the ground of one &s;treet being as high as the tops of the Hou|&s;es of the other, &s;o that to continue it, they were for|ced to build a Bridge or Arch in the <HI>Lower-&s;treet,</HI> to let the upper pa&s;s over it.</P>
<P>The City is fairly built of &s;tone, and well paved; ma|ny Hou&s;es are of &s;ix &s;tories high; they are &s;omewhat flat roofed after the <HI>Italian</HI> way; the Streets are not narrow, but the compa&s;s of ground will not admit them to be very broad; and their Buildings are remarkable both above and below ground; their Cellars are very deep. To &s;a|tisfie my curio&s;ity, I went into &s;ome of them, and found four Cellars one under another; they were arched, and
<PB N="76" REF="42"> had two pair of Stairs to de&s;cend into them. Some have an open &s;pace in the middle of each roof, to let the Air out of one Cellar into another, and from the lowe&s;t an <HI>adit</HI> or <HI>tube</HI> unto the top, to let the Air in and out from the &s;treet, &s;omewhat after the manner of the Mines.</P>
<P><HI>Aenaeas Sylvius,</HI> about two hundred years &s;ince, com|mending the City of <HI>Nurnburg,</HI> among other expre&s;&s;ions lets fall this: <HI>Cuperent Scotorum Reges tam egregi&egrave; quam mediocres Cives</HI> Norinbergen&s;es <HI>habitare.</HI> The Kings of <HI>Scots</HI> would be content to dwell &s;o well as the middle &s;ort of Citizens of <HI>Nurnburg.</HI> I mu&s;t confe&s;s, when I fir&s;t entred <HI>Nurnburg,</HI> I was much &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee &s;uch a noble, large, &s;pruce, rich, and well built City: But <HI>Vi|enna</HI> doth al&s;o de&s;erve the commendation which he af|fordeth it: <HI>Ubi Palatia digna Regibus &amp; Templa quae mi|rari</HI> Italia <HI>po&s;&s;it.</HI> Where there are Palaces fit for Kings and Churches, which <HI>Italy</HI> may admire. And this being &s;po|ken &s;o long ago, is now better verified of it.</P>
<P>The Imperial Palace is very Noble, Sub&s;tantial, and Princely furni&s;hed, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of two Courts; the one very large, the other le&s;&s;er, wherein the Emperour lodgeth. At the Entrance over the Gate, are &s;et in Ca|pital Letters the five Vowels, <HI>A, E, I, O, U;</HI> whereof the Phancies of men make various Interpretations.

<P>They have this Account how the&s;e came fir&s;t to be &s;et up in this place: That when <HI>Solyman</HI> the Magnificent be|&s;ieged <HI>Vienna,</HI> perceiving the Forces in the City to be ob&s;tinate, he had an intent to batter down the Steeple a|bout their ears: But &s;ome of the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's</HI> and great Com|manders, adverti&s;ing him how unprofitable a bu&s;ine&s;s it would prove, and withal when he took the City, what an honour it would be unto him to have &s;uch a Noble Py|ramid in his Dominions: He &s;ent word into the Town, That he was willing to &s;pare the Steeple, upon condition that they would &s;et up the half Moon and Star (the <HI>Tur|ki&s;h</HI> Arms) upon the top thereof. They returned An|&s;wer that they would, if he would &s;end the &s;ame
<PB N="80" REF="45"> unto them, which he did, and they placed it where it &s;tandeth.</P>
<P>This Spire hath the large&s;t Crockets I have ob&s;erved in any, they being above a yard long, and adorned with foliage work. The Spire of <HI>Land&s;hute</HI> in <HI>Bavaria,</HI> is accounted the highe&s;t in <HI>Germany;</HI> that of <HI>Stra&s;burg</HI> the neate&s;t and faire&s;t; and this of <HI>Vienna</HI> the large&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t. And therefore it is no wonder that when the Amba&s;&s;adours of <HI>Bo&s;na</HI> formerly came unto <HI>Vienna,</HI> they &s;o often viewed and admired this Fabrick, and plainly &s;aid that all the mony in their Country was not &s;ufficient to have built it.</P>
<P>This Steeple is accounted about four hundred &s;ixty and five foot high, being about half way up three hundred and thirty eight &s;teps. Be&s;ides other Hills, I could &s;ee <HI>Haimburger</HI> Hill within two miles of <HI>Pre&s;burg,</HI> and a great part of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> which the long Cour&s;e of the <HI>Da|nube</HI> rendred very plea&s;ant and delightful unto the eye. In the Chamber or Room from whence I had this pro&s;pect, there is a Clock, who&s;e Ca&s;e being of wood, was in part burnt down by Lightning, and therefore there is water always kept in this place to extingui&s;h the fire, and a man continually watcheth in the place where the Bells hand. There is al&s;o an In&s;trument of wood, or wooden Bells or Hammers, which they make u&s;e of from <HI>Good|friday</HI> till <HI>Ea&s;ter-&s;unday,</HI> all the time that our Saviour was in the Grave, during which time they permit no Bells to ring.</P>
<P>At one of the doors of the Church there is a &s;tone pla|ced in the wall, which is generally conceived to be one of the &s;tones wherewith St. <HI>Stephen</HI> was &s;toned. It &s;eem|ed to me &s;ome kind of pebble, and is worn and poli&s;hed by the hands of the people, who when they enter at that door, do touch it with their fingers. I was al&s;o &s;hewed

<P>The Univer&s;ity of <HI>Vienna</HI> is al&s;o remarkable, if we con&s;sider the Antiquity thereof, the number of Scholars, their cour&s;e of Studies, their accommodations, privi|ledges and advancements. This is &s;aid to have been be|gun by <HI>Albertus</HI> the Third, above three hundred years pa&s;t; and their Rules, Orders, and Statutes to have been borrowed from the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Paris,</HI> and the Students were di&s;tingui&s;hed into four Divi&s;ions or Nations; who, be&s;ides the General, have their particular Rules and Officers, and were comprehended under the <HI>Cla&s;&s;is</HI> of <HI>Au&s;trians,</HI> Nations of the <HI>Rhine, Hungarians,</HI> and <HI>Saxons.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>Au&s;trian</HI> Divi&s;ion were contained the <HI>Friulians,</HI> all of the Dioce&s;e of <HI>Trent,</HI> all <HI>Italy,</HI> with the other Pro|vinces beyond the Mountains. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>vian</HI> the <HI>Cla&s;&s;is</HI> of the <HI>Rhine</HI> were comprehended <HI>Sue|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="5 letters">, Al&s;atians, Franconians, Ha&s;&s;ians,</HI> d all the Pro|vinces

<P>The&s;e Divi&s;ions take up all the Nations of <HI>Europe;</HI> and indeed there are Students here of many Nations: and upon Contentions and Differences the &s;everal <HI>Cla&s;&s;es</HI> will hold unto their own, and take parts, and bandy again&s;t each other, but will all unite and hold together in differ|ences with Towns-men or Jews, which happen &s;ometimes unto an high degree.</P>
<P>They follow here the old beaten way of Knowledge: and I met with few who had any good in&s;ight in new <HI>Phi|lo&s;ophy;</HI> but there are many good <HI>Philologers,</HI> and are well ver&s;ed in Languages, Hi&s;tory and Antiquity: and there are many Learned Men either educated here, or come from other parts. Some who had taken notice of the <HI>Royal Socie|ty</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> were very inqui&s;itive after it; and when I had &s;atisfied them in all particulars, were very much plea&s;ed therewith. If they &s;hould fall into the way of <HI>Experimental Philo&s;ophy,</HI> being very indu&s;trious, 'tis ve|ry probable they may do much therein, and they were &s;ure to have the countenance of the Emperour. I found them al&s;o much affected with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Society in other parts of <HI>Germany.</HI> At the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Altorff</HI> I was much enquired of concerning it: and a Magi&s;trate of <HI>Nurnburg,</HI> who had got a <HI>Tele&s;cope</HI> from <HI>London,</HI> invited

<P>During my &s;tay at <HI>Vienna,</HI> I went unto a publick Ana|to my of a Woman that was beheaded: the <HI>Lecture</HI> la&s;ted &s;o long, that the Body was Nineteen days unburied. It was performed by a Learned Phy&s;ician, Dr. <HI>Wolf&s;tregel,</HI> who read in <HI>Latin</HI> to the &s;atisfaction of all per&s;ons. What I mo&s;t particularly ob&s;erved therein was this, The <HI>Pyra|midal Mu&s;cles</HI> very plain and large; the <HI>Uterus</HI> larger than is u&s;ually ob&s;erved; the <HI>Cartilago En&s;iformis</HI> double; the <HI>Lungs</HI> very black; the <HI>Eye</HI> was very well &s;hown; he produced an artificial Eye of Ivory, and another large one of Pa&s;tboard and Paper, contrived and made by him|&s;elf; the <HI>Mu&s;cles</HI> of the <HI>Pharynx, Larynx, Os Hyoides,</HI> and the <HI>Tongue,</HI> after their di&s;&s;ection, he reduced very hand&s;omely into their proper places again, to &s;hew their natural &s;ituation and po&s;ition. The <HI>Anatomy-Theatre</HI> was of capacity to receive above an hundred per&s;ons; and according to the cu&s;tome of other places, to avoid imper|tinent Spectators, a piece of Mony was given for admi&s;|&s;ion. Of <HI>Anatomy-Theatres,</HI> until of late, there have been few in <HI>Germany,</HI> or none. And when I was in the <HI>Anato|my-School</HI> at <HI>Altorff,</HI> near <HI>Nurenburg,</HI> that learned and ci|vil Profe&s;&s;or, Dr. <HI>Mauritius Hoffmannus,</HI> told me that the &s;ame was the Fir&s;t in <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Paulus de Sorbait,</HI> Prime Profe&s;&s;or, Phy&s;ician unto <HI>E|leonora</HI> the Empre&s;s Dowager, and Knight of <HI>Hungary,</HI> was the <HI>Rector Magnificus. Zwelfer,</HI> who writ <HI>Animad|ver&s;ions
<PB N="84" REF="48"> upon the Di&s;pen&s;atory of Au&s;burg,</HI> was in great re|pute in <HI>Vienna,</HI> and had built for him&s;elf a noble Hou&s;e in the City, but he died &s;ome time before my coming thi|ther.</P>
<P>In fine, the Univer&s;ity is noble, their Advancements con&s;iderable, their Priviledges great, and they have the power of life and death, from ancient and latter Conce&s;|&s;ions of their Dukes and Emperours.</P>
<P>But the greate&s;t lu&s;tre unto <HI>Vienna</HI> is the Re&s;idence of the pre&s;ent Emperour <HI>Leopoldus;</HI> he was born in the year 1638. he was Son unto the Emperour <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Third; he was baptized by the Names of <HI>Leopoldus, Ig|natius, Franci&s;cus, Balthazar, Jo&s;ephus, Felicianus.</HI> His elde&s;t Brother <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> King of the <HI>Romans,</HI> died of the Small Pox in his Fathers time. His Brother <HI>Carolus Jo&s;ephus,</HI> Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Teutonick Order,</HI> dyed 1662. He married <HI>Margareta</HI> Infanta of <HI>Spain,</HI> daughter unto King <HI>Philip</HI> the Fourth, who&s;e Children died Infants; a ver|tuous, affable, grave, and worthy Prince, and &s;eemed to me to live very happily here, in the love and honour of his People, Souldiers, and Clergy.</P>
<P>His Per&s;on is grave and graceful; he hath the <HI>Au&s;trian</HI> Lip remarkably, his Chin long, which is taken for a good Phy&s;iognomical mark, and a &s;ign of a con&s;tant, placid, and little troubled mind. He is conceived to carry in his Face the lineaments of four of his Predece&s;&s;ours, that is, of <HI>Rudolphus</HI> the Fir&s;t, of <HI>Maximilian</HI> the Fir&s;t, of <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth, and <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Fir&s;t. He was very affecti|onate unto his Empre&s;s, who, though but young, was a mode&s;t, grave Prince&s;s, had a good a&s;pect, was zealous in her Religion, and an Enemy unto the Jews. He &s;hewed al&s;o great re&s;pect and ob&s;ervance unto the Empre&s;s Dow|ager <HI>Eleonora,</HI> who was a &s;ober and prudent Prince&s;s, well skilled in all kind of curious Works, and delighted
<PB N="85" REF="48"> &s;ometimes to &s;hoot at Deer from a Stand, or at other Game, out of her Coach. He was al&s;o very loving unto his Si&s;ters, beautiful and good Ladies; whereof one, the elde&s;t, was &s;ince married unto that Noble Prince <HI>Michael Wi&s;nowitzski,</HI> King of <HI>Poland.</HI></P>
<P>He &s;peaks four Languages, <HI>German, Italian, Spani&s;h,</HI> and <HI>Latin.</HI> He is a great countenancer of Learned Men, and delighteth to read, and when occa&s;ion permitteth, will pa&s;s &s;ome hours at it. The worthy <HI>Petrus Lambe|cius</HI> his Library Keeper, and who is in great e&s;teem with him, will u&s;ually find out &s;ome Books for him which he conceiveth may be acceptable. While I was there he re|commended a Tran&s;lation of <HI>Religio Medici</HI> unto him, wherewith the Emperour was exceedingly plea&s;ed, and &s;pake very much of it unto <HI>Lambecius,</HI> in&s;omuch that <HI>Lambecius</HI> asked me whether I knew the Author, he be|ing of my own name, and whether he were living: And when he under&s;tood my near Relation to him, he became more kind and courteous than ever, and de&s;ired me to &s;end him that Book in the Original <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> which he would put into the Emperours Library: and pre&s;ented me with a neat little <HI>Latin</HI> Book, called <HI>Princeps in Com|pendio,</HI> written by the Emperours Father, <HI>Ferdinandus</HI> the Third.</P>
<P>He is al&s;o skilful in Mu&s;ick, compo&s;eth well, and de|lighted much in it, both at his Palace and the Church, which makes &s;o many Mu&s;icians in <HI>Vienna;</HI> for no place abounds more with them; and in the Evening we &s;eldom failed of Mu&s;ick in the Streets, and at our Windows: And the Emperours delight herein makes the Church-men take the greater care to &s;et off their Church-mu&s;ick, for he goeth often to Church, and not to one, but divers, e|&s;pecially the be&s;t Conventual Churches: and in his own Chappel &s;ome of his own Compo&s;itions are often play'd.
<PB N="86" REF="49"> He hath al&s;o excellent Mu&s;ick in his Palace, both Vocal and In&s;trumental; and his private Chappel is well &s;er|ved, where be&s;ides the excellent Mu&s;ick, there are al|ways eight or ten Counts, Pages to the Emperour, who &s;erve at the Altar with white wax Torches in their hands; and after the manner of the <HI>Italian</HI> Princes, divers <HI>Eunuchs</HI> to &s;ing.</P>
<P>For his Recreations abroad, he delighteth much in Hunting, e&s;pecially of the wild Boar in due &s;ea&s;ons; I have known him bring home &s;ix Boars in a morning. Some &s;tout per&s;ons, particularly Count <HI>Nicholas Serini,</HI> would encounter a wild Boar alone, but at la&s;t he unfortunately peri&s;hed by one, which hath made others more wary &s;ince; and therefore when the Boar is at a Bay, the Hunt&s;|men &s;o &s;tand about him, that the Emperour, or other great per&s;ons, may more &s;afely make u&s;e of their Boar|&s;pears upon him.</P>
<P>Surely there are great numbers of them about the Country, for they are no unu&s;ual or extraordinary Di&s;h in the City, though of a delicious and plea&s;ing ta&s;te. They feed upon <HI>Acorns, Beech-ma&s;t,</HI> and <HI>Che&s;nuts,</HI> upon the &s;pring or &s;prout of <HI>Broom, Juniper,</HI> and <HI>Shrubs,</HI> and up|on the roots of <HI>Fern,</HI> and will range into Corn-fields, and come out of Forre&s;ts into Vineyards. The Hunt&s;|men are notably ver&s;ed and skilful in that Game; for though they &s;ee it not, they will di&s;tingui&s;h a wild from a common Swine, and ghe&s;s whether that which they hunt be Male or Female, old or young, large or &s;mall, fat or lean; and this they chiefly conjecture from their tread or foot, and the ca&s;ting their hindfeet out of the track of their forefeet.</P>
<P>The Emperour being &s;o good a Hunt&s;man, it is the le&s;s wonder that he is e&s;teemed a good Hor&s;man. Certain it is, that he hath a very noble Stable of Hor&s;es, procured
<PB N="87" REF="49"> from all parts, <HI>Turki&s;h, Tartarian, Polonian, Tran&s;ylvanian, Saxon, Bohemian, Hungarian, Naples, &amp;c.</HI> and they are well managed; and they ride them to the &s;atisfaction of the Beholders.</P>
<P>Having &s;een the <HI>Ar&s;enal</HI> at <HI>Venice,</HI> the <HI>Stores</HI> at <HI>Chat|ham,</HI> and the <HI>Naval Provi&s;ions</HI> at <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> I am not like to admire any other, e&s;pecially &s;o far from the Sea, and looked for nothing of that nature in this place. Not|with&s;tanding I found an <HI>Ar&s;enal,</HI> and place for Naval Ve&s;&s;els to be &s;et out upon occa&s;ion, and &s;ome thereof were employed in the la&s;t <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> war, when they at|tempted to de&s;troy the Bridge of Boats which the <HI>Turks</HI> had made over the <HI>Danube,</HI> a little above <HI>Gran</HI> and <HI>Bare|han.</HI> They are built &s;omewhat like <HI>Galleys,</HI> carry great Guns, and a good number of Souldiers, and will make a &s;ight upon the broad deep &s;tream of the <HI>Danube,</HI> and may be hand&s;omely brought into the Town behind one of the Ba&s;tions, when the River is high; and hereof there are &s;ome at <HI>Rab</HI> and <HI>Komora,</HI> as I have declared el&s;ewhere.</P>

And &s;urely Strangers of parts and indu&s;try, &s;o they be of the <HI>Roman Church,</HI> are not like to rai&s;e their Fortunes any where better than in the&s;e parts.</P>
<P>Though the Emperour goeth not to war in Per&s;on, yet hath he been &s;ucce&s;sful in his wars, e&s;pecially in the la&s;t Battel with the <HI>Turks</HI> at St. <HI>Godart,</HI> where the bu&s;ine&s;s was hand&s;omly and actively managed, to &s;et upon the body of the <HI>Turks,</HI> which had pa&s;&s;ed the River <HI>Rab,</HI> before the whole Forces of the <HI>Vizier</HI> could come over, to the great &s;laughter of the <HI>Jani&s;aries</HI> and <HI>Turks,</HI> who fought &s;tout|ly, and were fir&s;t put to a Retreat by the <HI>French</HI> Caval|ry. For at fir&s;t the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;eemed to prevail, and had &s;lain a great part of two Regiments of the <HI>Auxiliaries</HI> which came out of <HI>Franconia,</HI> and after their cu&s;tome, had cut off their Heads.</P>
<P>Among the many notable things in <HI>Vienna,</HI> the <HI>Imperi|al</HI> Library is very remarkable. He who hath &s;een the <HI>Bodleian</HI> Library at <HI>Oxford,</HI> and the <HI>Vatican</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> would be much &s;urpri&s;ed to find &s;uch a notable one here, as may compare with them; e&s;pecially upon the extreme Borders of the Learned part of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The number and noblene&s;s of the Books doth much ex|ceed the receptacle or place which containeth them, as
<PB N="91" REF="51"> making no fair &s;hew at the entrance, and &s;omewhat want|ing light. But as for the number and value of the Books, they are of opinion here that it yieldeth unto none, but rather excelleth any other Library in <HI>Europe.</HI> There was a place de&s;igned for the building of a fit receptacle for them; but, I know not how, a Theatre for Comedies is now built in that place.</P>
<P>It is divided into eight Chambers or Rooms, which are &s;o well filled, that many Books are fain to lye upon the Floor; and the Shelves &s;tand &s;o clo&s;e, that there is but ju&s;t room to pa&s;s between them. The Manu&s;cripts &s;tand di&s;tinct from the printed Books, according to their Languages, being divided into &s;ix <HI>Cla&s;&s;es, Theological, Juridical, Medical, Philo&s;ophical, Hi&s;torical, Philologi|cal.</HI> There can &s;carce be a more admirable Collection than the Manu&s;cripts in part of the fir&s;t Chamber, of <HI>He|brew, Syriack, Arabick, Turki&s;h, Armenian, Aethiopick,</HI> and <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Books.</P>
<P>It was begun, at lea&s;t the Books began to be placed in this receptacle, by <HI>Maximilian</HI> the Fir&s;t, but hath been much encrea&s;ed by &s;ucceeding Emperours, mo&s;t of them, &s;ince <HI>Rodolphus</HI> the Fir&s;t, being much addicted unto Learning, there having been large acce&s;&s;ions from many noble Libraries, and mo&s;t upon the co&s;t of the Emper|ours. The choice&s;t Books in the famous Library of <HI>Bu|da,</HI> of King <HI>Matthias Corvinus,</HI> Son unto <HI>Huniades,</HI> are now in it. The notable Library of <HI>Wolfgangus La|zius,</HI> who was Library-Keeper, was brought hither, and Three thou&s;and Books of <HI>Johannes Sambucus</HI> are now in this Repo&s;itory.</P>
<P><HI>Augerius Bu&s;bequius,</HI> &s;ometime Library-Keeper hereof, added much unto it; and in his two <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Emba&s;&s;ies procured great number of noble <HI>Greek</HI> Manu&s;cripts at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> which are in&s;cribed with his own hand,
<PB N="92" REF="52"> <HI>Aug. de Bu&s;beck. emit Con&s;tantinopoli.</HI> A great many were added from the Library of the Learned <HI>Johannes Cu&s;pini|anus,</HI> Library Keeper, and Coun&s;ellor unto the Emper|our. The notable Libraries and Mathematical In&s;tru|ments of <HI>Tycho Brahe, Kepler,</HI> and <HI>Ga&s;&s;endus,</HI> were pur|cha&s;ed for it. But the large&s;t acce&s;&s;ion was made by the noble Library of Count <HI>Fugger,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ix|teen thou&s;and Volumes, was purcha&s;ed by <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Third. Many were brought, &s;ome few years pa&s;t, from the <HI>Ambra&s;ian</HI> Library by <HI>In&s;pruck,</HI> by the Learned <HI>Pe|trus Lambecius,</HI> Library Keeper, Hi&s;toriographer, and Coun&s;ellor unto the pre&s;ent Emperour; who hath al&s;o an excellent Library which is like to be added unto the <HI>Imperial.</HI> He then reckoned the Volumes in this great Library to amount at lea&s;t to Four&s;core thou&s;and; and by this time that number may be increa&s;ed, for he ad|deth &s;ome yearly. And the number might almo&s;t be endle&s;s, if they would make u&s;e of their priviledge, for the Emperour hath a right to have two Books of all that are printed in <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>They have al&s;o a great advantage at <HI>Vienna,</HI> to acquire good <HI>Manu&s;cripts</HI> from the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Dominions, for the Emperour is obliged to have a Re&s;ident with the Grand <HI>Signor</HI> where&s;oever he moveth or ordereth him to be; even at the la&s;t &s;ight of St. <HI>Godart,</HI> the Emperour's Re&s;ident was in the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Camp. And when I was at <HI>Lari&s;&s;a</HI> in <HI>The&s;&s;aly,</HI> the Re&s;ident <HI>Signor di Ca&s;a Nova,</HI> was inqui&s;i|tive after Books to be found among the <HI>Greeks</HI> in Mona|&s;teries and other places. And this Emperour, like his Father, will &s;pare no co&s;t toward &s;uch Acquiries.</P>
<P>By the e&s;pecial favour of my noble Friend <HI>Lambecius,</HI> I went many times into this Library, and he was &s;o cour|teous as to let me have what Books I de&s;ired unto my pri|vate Lodging: He would &s;hew me divers Books upon

A neat <HI>Table</HI> of <HI>Inlay'd Stone</HI> made by the pre&s;ent Empre&s;s Dowager <HI>Eleonora.</HI> A <HI>Nail</HI> of our <HI>Saviour</HI>'s <HI>Cro&s;s</HI> almo&s;t a foot long; our <HI>Saviour</HI>'s <HI>Blood;</HI> and two <HI>Thorns</HI> of his <HI>Crown,</HI> the one whiter than the other. <HI>Prie&s;ts Garments</HI> covered all over with large <HI>Pearl.</HI> The great and high e&s;teemed <HI>Agate Di&s;h,</HI> between three and four &s;pans Diameter, with XRISOS naturally in it. Unto which one applied that of St. <HI>Luke, Dico vobis quia &s;i hi tacuerint, lapides clamabunt.</HI></P>
<P>Unto which magnificent Rarities there is one more added, the noble <HI>Chain</HI> of <HI>Pearl</HI> of eight yards long, ta|ken from the <HI>Graff Tokoly</HI> in the late <HI>Hungarian</HI> war, as I under&s;tand &s;ince my Return.</P>
<P>I went unto divers noted Places about <HI>Vienna:</HI> I walk|ed unto the Hill of <HI>Vienna,</HI> two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> miles di&s;tant from the Town, going up all the way by an ea&s;ie A&s;cent; from whence I had a pro&s;pect of the City, and the Campagnia about it, together with the high Mountains in <HI>Steirmark</HI> covered with Snow: and in my return &s;aw the Palace of the Empre&s;s Dowager without the Town, called <HI>la Favo|rita,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ed by the Convent of the <HI>Paulini.</HI></P>
<P>About two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> miles Ea&s;tward from <HI>Vienna,</HI> there is a very noble Garden-place belonging to the Emperour, built by <HI>Rodolphus</HI> the Second, which hath been formerly
<PB N="101" REF="56"> well furni&s;hed, and provided with Plants, but now &s;eems to be neglected, and &s;omewhat ruinous. It con&s;i&s;teth of an inward and an outward &s;quare Garden: The inward is two hundred ordinary paces &s;quare, about the &s;ame big|ne&s;s with the Place Royal at <HI>Paris:</HI> It hath a <HI>Portico</HI> or <HI>Cloy&s;ter,</HI> &s;upported by Forty Pillars of white Stone on each &s;ide, and is covered with Copper; as are al&s;o the Pavilions which the common people think to be Gold. Be&s;ides this, there is an hand&s;ome row of Buildings well &s;eated, called <HI>N&eacute;w-gaba&uacute;,</HI> in which at pre&s;ent are many wild Bea&s;ts kept. Lions and Tigres breed here, and have young ones. Some &s;ay this was the place of <HI>Solyman</HI> the Magnificents Tent when he be&s;ieged <HI>Vienna.</HI></P>
<P>There is al&s;o, about two or three miles from <HI>Vienna,</HI> a noted place of Devotion, called <HI>Arnols,</HI> much frequen|ted, e&s;pecially in <HI>Lent,</HI> divers carrying Cro&s;&s;es very heavy all the way upon their &s;houlders. There is here a little Hou&s;e built exactly after that of the Sepulchre at <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> and al&s;o a hand&s;ome Copy of the Picture of our Saviour and the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> with their exact heights. That of our Saviour is about two yards high; that of the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin three or four &s;ingers breadth lower: The&s;e are taken from the Original in St. <HI>John de Lateran</HI> at <HI>Rome.</HI> Hither the Empre&s;s de&s;ired to go one morning from her own Palace on foot, out of Devotion, which &s;he perform|ed, though with a great deal of difficulty, &s;he being not u&s;ed to walk, and the way was du&s;ty. The Emperour accompanied her, and all the Court followed on foot, which made a hand&s;ome &s;hew.</P>
<P>Nearer unto <HI>Vienna</HI> there is al&s;o a remarkable place for Devotion, called <HI>Itzing:</HI> and in the way from <HI>Vienna</HI> unto it, the twelve Stations of the Cro&s;s are marked out in imitation of what is ob&s;erved near <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> in the <HI>Via Crucis,</HI> or <HI>Doloro&s;a,</HI> in our Saviours proceeding from
<PB N="102" REF="57"> the City unto Mount <HI>Calvary;</HI> the Figures thereof are printed, and the &s;everal paces between every Station &s;et down. The Emperour hath a hand&s;ome Park near <HI>Vien|na,</HI> called the <HI>Brater,</HI> wherein I beheld the effects of the great Lightning and Thunder which happened three days before, upon many great Trees which were torn, &s;plit, or twi&s;ted. There is a Hou&s;e of Plea&s;ure in it, where among other things, I could not but take notice of a Mu&s;ical In&s;trument which I had not &s;een before, a <HI>Seat</HI> or <HI>Che&s;t-drum;</HI> it hath a Cord like that of a <HI>Sea-trumpet,</HI> but &s;oundeth like a <HI>Kettle-drum.</HI></P>
<P>I went al&s;o unto <HI>Laxambourg,</HI> whither the Emperour often retireth; he hath a Hou&s;e in this place, but it is old, and not large. There is al&s;o a Hou&s;e of Plea&s;ure in the Mote, into which there is no other pa&s;&s;age but through a high <HI>Gorridore.</HI> The Ca&s;tle is commodiou&s;ly &s;eated for the Emperours recreation; and there is an eight-&s;quare Hou&s;e in the <HI>Mar&s;h,</HI> from which the Nobility and the Empre&s;s Dowager &s;ometimes u&s;ed to &s;hoot, &s;he being very expert therein. Over the Gate of the Emperours Hou&s;e hangs a great Rib and Jaw-bone, whereof I could get no better account, then they were the Rib and Jaw-bone of a heathen-maid. They &s;eemed to me to be Bones of an <HI>Elephant</HI> But many things that are old or ob&s;cure, they call, in this Country, Heathen: as <HI>Roman</HI> Coyns, they call Heathen mony. And the Pea&s;ants brought me, in a place which had been formerly an old <HI>Roman</HI> Station, part of the bit of a Bridle digged up, which they concluded to be a Heathen Key.</P>
<P>From hence I went unto <HI>Manner&s;dorff,</HI> &s;eated not far from the River <HI>Leyta,</HI> where there is a natural <HI>hot Bath,</HI> called the <HI>Wildebath;</HI> it ari&s;eth under a Church, the Church being built over the Spring-head. The water of it is but Lukewarm, and therefore when they de&s;ire it hotter, they boyl it, and &s;o bathe in Tubs in a large room.
<PB N="103" REF="57"> From that Sub&s;tance which &s;ticketh to the &s;ides of the Coppers in the boyling of it, they judge it to be impreg|nated with <HI>Sulphur, Salt-peter,</HI> and <HI>Chalk.</HI> The water colours the &s;tones, and makes them look, when wet, like fine <HI>Turquoi&s;es.</HI> And the vapour of the Bath hanging up|on the Mo&s;s on the &s;ides, gives it an Amber or Gold co|lour. The Phy&s;icians of <HI>Vienna</HI> have given a good ac|count concerning the u&s;e of the&s;e Baths in <HI>High-dutch.</HI> Not far from hence is a noted Quarry of Stone, out of which a great part of <HI>Vienna</HI> is built. The Stones being large they cut and &s;quare them at the Quarry.</P>
<P>From hence I proceeded to the <HI>New&s;idler-&s;ea</HI> or <HI>Lake,</HI> &s;o called from <HI>New&s;idle,</HI> which is a Town &s;eated upon the Northern part of it, con&s;i&s;ting of one &s;treet and &s;ome back-hou&s;es, and a &s;mall, &s;quare, old Ca&s;tle upon a Hill, from whence I had a good pro&s;pect over the Lake. It is about three <HI>German</HI> miles broad, and &s;even miles long. The faire&s;t Lake in the&s;e parts, affording plenty of Fi&s;h; encompa&s;&s;ed and thickly &s;et about with &s;mall Towns and Villages; and hath no River, at lea&s;t not con&s;iderable, running into or out of it. A little way from the Gate of <HI>New&s;idle</HI> they dig out a black earth, out of which they make <HI>Salt peter.</HI> In this Journey, not far from <HI>Himburg,</HI> we pa&s;&s;ed by a place called <HI>Rauckward,</HI> which, though it &s;eems not high, looks over a great part of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> and as far as <HI>Brin,</HI> the &s;econd City of <HI>Moravia,</HI> a part al&s;o of the Kingdom of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and a part of the Kingdom of <HI>Hungaria.</HI> I went afterwards four <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> miles up the Stream of the <HI>Danube,</HI> to &s;ee a noted Quarry of Stone in a Hill called <HI>Altenburg.</HI> The beds, rows, or ca&s;es of the Stones lye not horizontally, but rather elevated Northward, about the height of the Angle forty, yet are not always &s;o regularly placed, but rather follow the &s;hape of the Hill, and according to that are differently
<PB N="104" REF="58"> &s;ituated. Here I al&s;o ob&s;erved a Sub&s;tance between a Clay and a Stone called <HI>Leber&s;tein,</HI> or <HI>Liver&s;tone;</HI> and upon many of the&s;e Stones I found the figures of Trees and Leaves, though not &s;o deep or neat as upon the Stones by <HI>Florence;</HI> yet very prettily marked, and often with broader Leaves than I had el&s;ewhere ob&s;erved. I pa&s;&s;ed forward to <HI>Clo&s;ter-Neuburg,</HI> a Town mo&s;t of it belonging to that notable rich Mona&s;tery &s;eated here, founded by St. <HI>Leopoldus</HI> Marque&s;s of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> and &s;ince much enriched by &s;ucceeding Donations.</P>
<P><HI>Matthaeus Merian</HI> hath a goodcut of the Pro&s;pect of the <HI>Danube</HI> here abouts, and in what manner it pa&s;&s;eth down|wards between the two great Hills of <HI>Kalenburg</HI> and <HI>Bi&s;n|burg.</HI> Upon one Peak of <HI>Kalenburg</HI> live divers <HI>Camal|dulen&s;es,</HI> of an Order the mo&s;t &s;evere of any, living mo&s;t upon Roots and Herbs, in the manner of <HI>Hermites.</HI> Near their Cells they had paved the ground with tho&s;e Stones I mentioned, which were naturally marked with the &s;hapes of Trees and Plants.</P>
<P>After an open Autumn there followed a &s;harp Winter at <HI>Vienna,</HI> in the months of <HI>December</HI> and <HI>January.</HI> The branches of the <HI>Danube</HI> were &s;oon frozen over. The main Stream, by rea&s;on of its &s;wift Current, held out longer, but was afterwards al&s;o frozen. Some have thought that this River is more apt to freez than others. And we read of Battels which have been fought upon this River frozen; but I could not make any regular Ob&s;ervation thereof. This hard weather the ground being covered with Snow, afforded hand&s;ome Recreations unto men, and &s;ome unto the Ladies, in running Cour&s;es in hand&s;ome Sleds and Devices upon the Snow. Their Sleds were well contrived in the &s;hape of <HI>Gryphins, Tigers, Swans, Scallop Shells, Dolphins, Peacocks,</HI> and the like Curio&s;ities, carved, paint|ed, and gilded. The Lady &s;its in one of the&s;e, richly ha|bited
<PB N="105" REF="58"> in Velvet, lined with rich Furrs, &s;et off with Lace and Jewels, in a Velvet Cap lined with Sables. The Sled is drawn by a Hor&s;e, dre&s;&s;ed up with Feathers of all co|lours, and Bells hanging about him, a pair of Stags horns behind his head, Ribbons and other Ornaments: one or more Pages ride by on Hor&s;e-back with Torches in their hands. And after this manner they perform their Cour&s;e upon the frozen Snow about the &s;treets of <HI>Vienna</HI> in the night, with good &s;peed one after another. A Gentleman &s;its behind the Lady and guides the Hor&s;e. But the Fro&s;t breaking up put an end to the&s;e Recreations. The Fro&s;t began and ended here the &s;ame day that it began and end|ed in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Fe&s;tivity of <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> was ob&s;erved much after the &s;ame Manner, Ceremonies, and Solemnities as in <HI>Italy.</HI> On <HI>Chri&s;tmas-day</HI> the Emperour dined publickly, attend|ed with many Nobles and great Per&s;ons, and three re|markable low Dwarfs. Upon St. <HI>Stephens-day</HI> he went to the Cathedral of St. <HI>Stephen,</HI> and went up to the Altar, kneeled, and ki&s;&s;ed the Plate whereon the <HI>Ho&s;tia</HI> had lain. At the <HI>Epiphany</HI> or <HI>Twelfth-tide,</HI> the old cu&s;tome of choo|&s;ing King and Queen was ob&s;erved at Court. Count <HI>Le&s;ley</HI> happened to be King, the Emperour laid the Cloath, and the Empre&s;s filled out Wine, together with other old Cu&s;tomes.</P>
<P>Before <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> there was extraordinary mirth and jollity at the Court upon occa&s;ion of a Marriage: For Count <HI>Serau,</HI> Governour of <HI>Gratz</HI> in <HI>Styria,</HI> married a natural Daughter of <HI>Philip</HI> the Fourth, King of <HI>Spain,</HI> which was ob&s;erved with many noble Solemnities and Bravery. And the Nobility and Ladies were &s;o &s;ub|&s;tantially &s;plendid, that I was much &s;urpri&s;ed there|at.</P>
<PB N="106" REF="59">
<P>This was followed by a Funeral Solemnity for the Count of <HI>Draun,</HI> who was Colonel of the Forces in <HI>Vienna,</HI> and who had one of the noble&s;t Hou&s;es in the City; his Corps was brought out of <HI>Italy,</HI> and interred in the <HI>Dominican</HI> Church, where he formerly built a very fair Altar, there was rai&s;ed for him a <HI>Ca&s;trum Do|loris,</HI> hand&s;omely contrived and &s;et round with white Wax Torches and Candles.</P>
<P>While I was in <HI>Vienna,</HI> the Empre&s;s <HI>Margarita</HI> was delivered of a Daughter, which was Chri&s;tned by the Name of <HI>Maria, Antonina, Jo&s;epha, Benedicta, Ro&s;alia, Petronella,</HI> but &s;he lived not many months. When the Empre&s;s came abroad, &s;he brought the Child to the <HI>Au|gu&s;tines</HI> Church, where Cardinal <HI>Carlo Caraffa,</HI> the Pope's Nuncio, received it, ble&s;&s;ed it, and laid it upon the Altar.</P>
<P>During my &s;tay here, the Election was in readine&s;s for a King of <HI>Poland,</HI> after the voluntary re&s;ignation of that Crown by King <HI>Ca&s;imir;</HI> and Couriers often pa&s;&s;ed be|tween that Country and this. There were Competitors the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI>'s Son, the Duke of <HI>Newburg,</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Lorrain.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> moved actively for the Duke of <HI>Newburg,</HI> the Emperour for the Prince of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> who was then at <HI>Vienna,</HI> in great favour with the Emperour, who greatly promoted his intere&s;t; a Per&s;on of great e&s;teem, and who, if General <HI>Lubomirski</HI> had been living, who was his intimate Friend, in all pro|bability might have obtained the Crown; and thereupon it was conceived that he &s;hould have married the Emper|our's Si&s;ter. But the <HI>Poles</HI> made choice of one of their own Country, who was no Competitor, <HI>Michael Wi&s;no|witski,</HI> lately decea&s;ed, who al&s;o married the Si&s;ter of the Emperour.</P>
<PB N="107" REF="59">
<P>When I was here, there were many Amba&s;&s;adours of Note, <HI>Don Baltha&s;ar de la Cueva,</HI> Marqui&s;s of <HI>Malagon,</HI> and brother to the Viceroy of <HI>Naples,</HI> was Amba&s;&s;adour for <HI>Spain.</HI> Cardinal <HI>Carlo Caraffa</HI> was the Pope's Nuncio. The <HI>Venetian</HI> Amba&s;&s;adour Extraordinary, &s;olicited for a&s;&s;i&s;tance for <HI>Candia,</HI> and he obtained the Regiment of <HI>Porcia</HI> under Marqui&s;s <HI>Pio.</HI> Count <HI>Souches</HI> the younger, who was Governour of <HI>Leopold&s;tadt,</HI> and many noble and valiant Souldiers were preparing for that Expedition. The <HI>Turks</HI> gave a&s;&s;urance of the <HI>Grand Signor</HI>'s intention to maintain the Peace inviolably; and reque&s;ted the Em|perour not to a&s;&s;i&s;t the <HI>Venetians</HI> or <HI>Tran&s;ilvanians,</HI> nor to promote, but rather hinder, the Election of the Em|perour of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI>'s Son to the Crown of <HI>Poland.</HI> The Bi&s;hop of <HI>Beziers,</HI> &s;ent by the King of <HI>France</HI> to the E|lection of the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> came not hither, but pa&s;|&s;ed through <HI>Nurenburg,</HI> where I lodged at the &s;ame Inn: They were generally here again&s;t the <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;t, and &s;o were a great part of the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Nobility. An Amba&s;&s;a|dour came al&s;o from the <HI>Cham</HI> of <HI>Tartary,</HI> to confirm a Peace, and afford mutual A&s;&s;i&s;tance upon occa&s;ion. <HI>Cha Gagi Aga</HI> was the Amba&s;&s;adour, who brought a Pre&s;ent of the be&s;t <HI>Tartarian</HI> Hor&s;es, which are of high e&s;teem for &s;wiftne&s;s, hardine&s;s, boldne&s;s in pa&s;&s;ing frozen Ri|vers, and taking and &s;wimming over great Streams. He was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with noble Pre&s;ents of Plate. The Em|perour pre&s;ented the <HI>Cham</HI> of Tartary with a fair Silver Ba&s;on and Ewer, and a curious Watch; and &s;ent Pre&s;ents unto the <HI>Chammine</HI> his Wife,; and al&s;o to his Si&s;ter and four Brothers. His Followers were &s;tout men, of good &s;tature, cour&s;e Complexions, wearing long furr'd Ve&s;ts and Calpack's, or furr'd Caps. Some of them had &s;ilver Rings with the &s;ame Signatures of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Seales. They took much Tobacco in very long Pipes. Their
<PB N="108" REF="60"> Tobacco is not in Rolls, but in Leaves, and dry. They went about wandring and gazing at mo&s;t things, as Chur|ches, Hou&s;es, Shops: And took much delight to be in the Fair, where they would take much notice of &s;mall trifles. Yet the&s;e are the men that make &s;uch &s;ad Incur|&s;ions into the Ea&s;tern parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> and carrying away &s;o many thou&s;ands, &s;ell them to the <HI>Turks,</HI> and &s;o repair the defect of People in <HI>Turky.</HI> And now after the Con|&s;umption of men in <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and the Country about by the Plague, are like to be active in that Trade, ho|ping to find better Markets for their Plagiaries and De|predations.</P>
<P>There are divers <HI>Greeks</HI> who trade to <HI>Vienna,</HI> and ma|ny live in the Town, among which I met with three con|&s;iderable per&s;ons. One a grave Abbot, who was forced from his Convent by the <HI>Turk,</HI> upon &s;u&s;picion that he cor|re&s;ponded with tho&s;e of <HI>Candia.</HI> Another who went by the name of <HI>Con&s;tantinus Catacuzenos,</HI> and was of the Blood Royal of the <HI>Catacuzeni.</HI> The third was <HI>Jeremi|as</HI> a <HI>Greek</HI> Prie&s;t, who had travelled through <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>France</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> and from thence through the <HI>Low-Countries</HI> and <HI>Germany</HI> to <HI>Vienna,</HI> and intended for <HI>Con|&s;tantinople.</HI> He came into <HI>England</HI> to enquire after a young man who was in a Ship which was fir&s;t taken by an <HI>Algerine,</HI> and afterwards by an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> man of war in the <HI>Levant.</HI> He was very kindly u&s;ed in <HI>England,</HI> and particu|larly at <HI>Cambridge.</HI> He did a great deal of honour at <HI>Vienna</HI> unto the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, declaring that they were the mo&s;t civil, generous, and learned people he had met with in all his Travels, and that he no where found &s;o many who could &s;peak or under&s;tand <HI>Greek,</HI> or who gave him &s;o good &s;atisfaction in all parts of Knowledge: And as a te&s;timony of his re&s;pect and gratitude, reque&s;ted me to enclo&s;e a <HI>Greek</HI> Letter unto Dr. <HI>Pier&s;on,</HI> now Lord
<PB N="109" REF="60"> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Barrow,</HI> now Ma&s;ter of <HI>Tri|nity Colledge</HI> in <HI>Cambridge.</HI></P>
<P>Mo&s;t men live here plentifully, there being abundance of all provi&s;ion. They have great quantity of Corn, which upon Scarcity, by the help of the <HI>Danube,</HI> might be brought unto them from remoter parts. The Country affordeth &s;uch plenty of wine, that they &s;end a con&s;ide|rable quantity up the River. They have al&s;o rich wines out of <HI>Hungary</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> and &s;uch variety, that there are more than thirty &s;everal &s;orts of Wine to be &s;old in <HI>Vien|na.</HI> They are not al&s;o without good Beer. <HI>Hal&s;tadt</HI> in <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> affordeth them Salt, where they make it by letting in water into the hollow parts of a Mountain, where it drinketh in the Salt of the Earth, and is afterwards let out and boiled up. This affordeth great profit to the Emperor, and therefore the <HI>Hungarian</HI> Salt is not permit|ted to be brought higher than <HI>Pre&s;burg.</HI> They have al&s;o plenty of Sheep and Oxen; but for Oxen at pre&s;ent they are al&s;o &s;upplied from <HI>Hungary,</HI> nor only from the Coun|tries in the Emperours Dominions, but from the Turki&s;h parts, by permi&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Grand Signor;</HI> and they are brought hither by the Ea&s;tern Company of <HI>Vienna.</HI> They eat much wild Boar, whereof the Fat is delicious, like that of Veni&s;on with us. They want not Hares, Rab|bets, Partridges, Phea&s;ants. A Fowl called <HI>Ha&s;enhendal,</HI> or <HI>Gallina Corylorum,</HI> is much e&s;teemed by them, which made me the more wonder to meet with &s;ome odde di&s;hes at their Tables; as <HI>Guiny-pigs,</HI> divers &s;orts of <HI>Snails,</HI> and <HI>Tortoi&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Danube,</HI> and many Rivers which run into it, afford them plenty of Fi&s;h, extraordinary <HI>Carps, Trouts, Ten|ches, Pikes, Eels,</HI> &s;everal &s;orts of <HI>Lampries,</HI> and many Fi&s;hes finely coloured; the white Fi&s;h, <HI>Crevi&s;es</HI> very large; the be&s;t come out of the River <HI>Swechet,</HI> not far
<PB N="110" REF="61"> from <HI>Vienna.</HI> They have al&s;o that &s;ub&s;tantial large fi&s;h, called a <HI>Scheiden,</HI> or <HI>Silurus Ge&s;neri,</HI> larger than <HI>Pike, Salmon,</HI> or any of our River Fi&s;hes; but the great Fi&s;hes called <HI>Hau&s;ons,</HI> or <HI>Hu&s;ones,</HI> in <HI>John&s;tonus,</HI> for largene&s;s ex|ceed all others; &s;ome being twenty foot long. Some think this to be the &s;ame Fi&s;h which <HI>Aelian</HI> nameth <HI>An|tacetus,</HI> and &s;peaketh largely of the fi&s;hing for them in <HI>I&s;ter.</HI> I was at the fi&s;hing places for <HI>Hau&s;ons</HI> in <HI>Schut</HI> I&s;land, between <HI>Pre&s;burg</HI> and <HI>Komara,</HI> for they come not u&s;ually higher, e&s;pecially in &s;hoals; and it is much that they come &s;o high, for they are conceived to come out of the <HI>Euxine-&s;ea,</HI> and &s;o up the &s;tream. They eat them both fre&s;h and &s;alted; they ta&s;te mo&s;t like <HI>Sturgeon.</HI> It is a Cartilagineous Fi&s;h, con&s;i&s;ting of gri&s;tles, and they have a hollow nervous chord all down the back, which being dried &s;erveth for a whip. When they fi&s;h for them they blow a Horn or Trumpet, and know where they go by the moving of the water. From <HI>Venice</HI> they are &s;upplied with Oy&s;ters, with &s;alt <HI>Sturgeon,</HI> and &s;ome|times with red <HI>Herrings,</HI> and great variety of other Fi&s;hes pickled up: as al&s;o with <HI>Oranges, Limons,</HI> and other Fruits. Ob&s;erving much freedom, mu&s;ick, and jollity in the City. I wondered how they could content them|&s;elves without Plays, for there were few while I was there, till the Players came hither out of <HI>Saxony,</HI> and a|cted here for a time. The Je&s;uites would &s;ometimes en|tertain the Emperour and Empre&s;s with a Comedy at their Colledge; and I had once the favour to be at one when they were pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>But they have Dancing and Fencing often, and every <HI>Holy-day</HI> after dinner, the people flock to &s;ome Inns where there is Dancing in the inward Rooms, and Fencing and Playing of Prizes upon a Stage in the Yard; and at the Windows, or from the Galleries, behold the Fencers

<P>In Trea&s;on and high Crimes they cut off the right Hand of the Malefactor, and his Head immediately after. I &s;aw a Woman beheaded &s;itting in a Chair, the Executioner &s;triking off her Head with a Fore-blow, &s;he behaved her &s;elf well, and was accompanied unto the Market place by the <HI>Confraternity</HI> of the <HI>Dead,</HI> who have a charitable care of &s;uch Per&s;ons, and are not of any Religious Order, but <HI>Lay men,</HI> among whom al&s;o in this place there are many Fraternities and Orders; as of the <HI>Holy Virgin,</HI> of the <HI>Holy Cro&s;s</HI> and others. Another per&s;on al&s;o executed after the &s;ame manner; as &s;oon as his Head fell to the ground, while the Body was in the Chair, a man ran &s;peedily with a Pot in his hand, and filling it with the Blood yet &s;pouting out of his Neck, he pre&s;ently drank it off, and ran away; and this he did as a Remedy again&s;t the <HI>Falling Sickne&s;s.</HI> I have read of &s;ome who have ap|proved the &s;ame Medicine; and heard of others who have done the like in <HI>Germany.</HI> And <HI>Gel&s;us</HI> takes notice, that in his time &s;ome Epileptical per&s;ons did drink the Blood of the <HI>Gladiatours.</HI> But many Phy&s;icians have, in all times, abominated that Medicine. Nor did I &s;tay after|wards &s;o long as to know the effect thereof, as to the in|tended cure. But mo&s;t men looked upon it as of great uncertainty: and of all men the Jews, who &s;uffer no Blood to come into their Lips, mu&s;t mo&s;t di&s;like it.</P>
<P>At <HI>Pre&s;burg</HI> they have a &s;trange way of Execution, &s;till u&s;ed at <HI>Metz,</HI> and &s;ome other places, by a Maid, or En|gine like a Maid finely dre&s;&s;ed up with her hands before her. The Malefactor &s;alutes her fir&s;t, and then retireth. But at his &s;econd &s;alute &s;he openeth her hands and cuts his Heart in &s;under.</P>

<P>Though the Winter was &s;harp, yet the advantage of Stoves, and lying between two Feather-beds, made it tolerable: For they u&s;e Stoves here as in other parts of <HI>Germany,</HI> where they lodge and eat in Stoves; and great Per&s;ons have Stoves in the Church, or &s;uch as look into the Church. There are Stoves al&s;o in the publick Schools where Lectures are read. And this way of ly|ing between two Feather-beds, with a neat laced &s;heet &s;pread over, is more convenient in a cold Country, than mo&s;t others they make u&s;e of. For in the common Inns in <HI>Germany</HI> they generally &s;leep upon Straw, and al&s;o in <HI>Hungary</HI> almo&s;t every where; and more Ea&s;terly upon the ground, &s;preading a Carpet or Saddle-cloath under them: and more Northerly they content them&s;elves with the Skins of Bea&s;ts, <HI>Bears, Elks,</HI> or the like; upon which they &s;leep in the night. Tho&s;e that &s;leep lowe&s;t are coole&s;t in a Stove; tho&s;e that lye upon Tables, Benches, or higher, are more expo&s;ed to the heat. The Citizens of <HI>Vienna</HI> are well attired, and u&s;e Furs very much. The Women wear a high Velvet Bonnet, lined or faced there|with. The Place &s;eemed to be healthful; but they &s;peak much of the <HI>Colica Au&s;triaca,</HI> as an Endemial and Local Di&s;ea&s;e, very hardly yielding unto good <HI>Medicines.</HI> They &s;peak good <HI>German</HI> at the Court and in the City; but the Common and Country people &s;eemed to &s;peak grumb|lingly, and be&s;ides their accent, have divers words different from other parts.</P>
<P>They have a Cu&s;tome upon St. <HI>Nicholas-day</HI> to put &s;ome &s;mall Gift into the Childrens &s;hoes; among other things they put in Medals and Dollars made of paper and flower gilded and &s;ilvered over, yet &s;carce worth a penny. They &s;ell <HI>Trochies</HI> or <HI>Tablets</HI> in the Markets, made of the pulpe of the Fruit of <HI>Hip-briar,</HI> made &s;harp with <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>Sul|phur,</HI> very refre&s;hing.

<P>When I was at <HI>Venice</HI> in the time of the <HI>Carnival,</HI> I ob|&s;erved many Recreations and Shews, as Rope-dancing, flying down the Rope, cutting off Bulls-necks with Swords, and many other. But at <HI>Vienna</HI> a notable trick which I &s;aw there plea&s;ed me much: A man of a middle Stature laid down upon his back, and a heavy Anvil was placed upon his Brea&s;t, as much as two men could well lift, then two other men with great Hammers laid on, un|til they had given almo&s;t an hundred blows, and cut in &s;un|der a great Hor&s;hoe of iron, about half an inch thick.</P>
<P>Here is no Chri&s;tian Religion publickly permitted but the <HI>Roman,</HI> and therefore tho&s;e of the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> and <HI>Re|formed Religion</HI> are fain to re&s;ort unto <HI>Pre&s;burg,</HI> Forty miles off, for which they have &s;ome convenience by the <HI>Danube,</HI> and a <HI>Coach</HI> which goeth every day. In the time of <HI>Maximilian</HI> the Second, they were permitted the Ex|erci&s;e of their Religion in the Church of the <HI>Holy Cro&s;s,</HI> in the City of <HI>Vienna.</HI> But afterwards were prohibited by <HI>Rodolphus</HI> the Second. The Emperour <HI>Matthias</HI> gave them permi&s;&s;ion to meet at <HI>Hernals,</HI> a little more than an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> mile from <HI>Vienna;</HI> and gave leave to their <HI>Mini|&s;ters</HI> to come into the City, and there to <HI>chri&s;ten, marry, baptize,</HI> and <HI>vi&s;it</HI> the <HI>&s;ick.</HI> From which time they encrea|&s;ed very much, till <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Second, returning from the Battel of <HI>Prague,</HI> bani&s;hed their <HI>Mini&s;ter</HI> from <HI>Vi|enna</HI> and <HI>Arnols;</HI> &s;ent the <HI>Freyherr Jorger,</HI> to whom the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Arnolds</HI> belonged, Pri&s;oner unto <HI>Lintz;</HI> and never gave over till he had taken away their Priviledges and Freedom of meeting publickly in any part of <HI>lower Au&s;tria.</HI></P>
<P>But here are no &s;mall number of <HI>Jews,</HI> who have a di|&s;tinct Habitation a&s;&s;igned them over the Water. They have
<PB N="114" REF="65"> al&s;o a Street allowed them in the City for the day time, but they mu&s;t all depart at night beyond the River into the Suburbs.</P>
<P>They are much di&s;ta&s;ted by the Citizens and Trade&s;|men, and the Scholars agree but ill with them. While I was at <HI>Vienna</HI> there was a quarrel between them to an high degree. For the <HI>Scholars</HI> a&s;&s;aulted the <HI>Jews</HI> Town, beat, wounded, and threw divers of them into the Ri|ver. Divers <HI>Scholars</HI> were wounded, &s;ome killed, and al&s;o &s;ome Souldiers who were commanded out to com|po&s;e the Fray: and the <HI>Jews</HI> Town was guarded many days by the Souldiers of the City. This begot &s;uch ill Blood and Complaints; that a good number of the <HI>Jews</HI> were to be bani&s;hed at a certain day. The <HI>Jews,</HI> to in|gratiate with the Empre&s;s, then with Child, pre&s;ented her with a noble <HI>Silver Cradle,</HI> but &s;he would not receive it. And there was great danger of the general bani&s;hment of them when I left that City, which was afterwards effe|cted, they being &s;everely prohibited from living, not on|ly at <HI>Vienna,</HI> but in any part of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> where there were formerly whole Villages of them, &s;o as they were forced to betake them&s;elves into the Dominions of the <HI>Turk,</HI> unto <HI>Venice,</HI> into <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Bohemia.</HI> They be|ing not permitted to dwell in the Neighbour Countries of <HI>Hungary</HI> &s;ubject to the Emperour, <HI>Styria,</HI> or <HI>Carinthia.</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s they &s;eemed u&s;eful unto the place for rea|dy accommodation of any thing, either by &s;ale or ex|change, but the people looked with an evil eye upon them, as taking away much of their Trade and Employ|ment. They al&s;o looked upon them as u&s;ele&s;s in war for defence of the place; and were not without &s;ome jealou|&s;ie that they held corre&s;pondence with the <HI>Turks,</HI> and gave Intelligence of their Affairs unto them. Yet the Souldiery dealt much with them, and Captains for the &s;uddain ha|biting,
<PB N="115" REF="65"> furni&s;hing, and accommodating of their Compa|nies. And dining one day with a Commander at a <HI>Jews</HI> Hou&s;e, among&s;t other Di&s;cour&s;e I asked the <HI>Jew</HI> con|cerning the <HI>ten Tribes,</HI> and where they were? He &s;aid <HI>they were far off in</HI> A&s;ia, <HI>beyond a great Lake which was continually &s;tormy, and &s;carce pa&s;&s;able, but upon their Sab|bath-day, upon which days the Jews do not willingly travel.</HI></P>
<P>I have &s;een their <HI>Circumci&s;ion</HI> at <HI>Rome, Padua,</HI> and o|ther parts. Their <HI>Phy&s;icians</HI> ordinarily profe&s;s great skill in <HI>Urines;</HI> and the common people re&s;ort unto them rather than unto <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> and are &s;o credulous, and have &s;uch an opinion of them, that they might be made to believe they have &s;ome old <HI>Receipts</HI> of King <HI>Solomon.</HI></P>
<P>There are many <HI>Jews</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> yet they &s;eem to me to be in greater numbers in <HI>Germany.</HI> In <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> they are al&s;o grown very numerous. At <HI>Franckfurt</HI> they told me there were &s;even thou&s;and of them, which &s;eemed &s;carce credible. At <HI>Colen</HI> they are in great numbers: at <HI>Ham|burg</HI> not a few. But the greate&s;t number &s;urely is in <HI>Prague.</HI></P>
<P>Though they be permitted in many Countries, yet di|vers <HI>Chri&s;tian Princes</HI> and <HI>States</HI> have a&s;&s;igned them &s;ome mark in their <HI>Habits,</HI> to di&s;tingui&s;h them. In <HI>Avignon</HI> their <HI>Hats</HI> are <HI>yellow.</HI> In <HI>Italy</HI> their <HI>Hats</HI> are covered o|ver with <HI>Taffate.</HI> In <HI>Germany</HI> they wear <HI>Ruffs</HI> and <HI>Gowns</HI> with great <HI>Capes.</HI> In <HI>Holland</HI> I ob&s;erved no di&s;tinction. But the <HI>Jews</HI> there, mo&s;t of them having come out of <HI>Portugal,</HI> there may be &s;ome &s;u&s;picion of them from their Complexion.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, when I con&s;ider the old &s;trength of <HI>Vienna,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting in an old <HI>wall</HI> and a deep <HI>ditch,</HI> I cannot much wonder that <HI>Matthias Corvinus,</HI> King of <HI>Hungary,</HI> took this City. And I mu&s;t a&s;cribe it, under God, unto the &s;ingular valour and re&s;olution of the Defendants, that
<PB N="116" REF="66"> <HI>Solyman</HI> the Magnificent, with two hundred thou&s;and men, was not able to take it, and though he made large brea|ches, could never enter it, but lo&s;t &s;ome thou&s;ands at an A&s;&s;ault, and departed at la&s;t with the lo&s;s of a great part of his Army. But this place is now in a far better con|dition, &s;trongly fortified, and able to re&s;i&s;t the greate&s;t Forces of <HI>Turky.</HI> The <HI>hou&s;es</HI> are cleared from the <HI>wall;</HI> and yet for better &s;ecurity, when I was there, Count <HI>Souches</HI> advi&s;ed the Emperour to pull down part of the <HI>Suburbs</HI> upon the other &s;ide of the neare&s;t branch of the <HI>Danube,</HI> le&s;t the <HI>Turks</HI> might take advantage to play up|on the two <HI>Ba&s;tions</HI> on that &s;ide.</P>
<P>It would be a &s;ad lo&s;s for <HI>Chri&s;tendome</HI> if this place were in the hands of the <HI>Turk;</HI> and no man knows where he would re&s;t. If he &s;hould begin with this place, and take it, the &s;trong holds of <HI>Rab, Komara,</HI> and <HI>Leopold|&s;tadt</HI> would want their &s;upport, and &s;oon fall into his po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion; and if he were Lord of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> a great part of <HI>Germany</HI> would lye bare unto him: and probably it would not be long before he vi&s;ited <HI>Italy,</HI> into which Country he would then find other ways than by <HI>Palma nova.</HI></P>

<P>Leaving <HI>Cottenburg,</HI> I came to <HI>Colline</HI> and to <HI>Bohemi|an Broda,</HI> &s;o named to di&s;tingui&s;h it from <HI>Dutch</HI> or <HI>Teu|tonick Broda</HI> before mentioned, a con&s;iderable good Town, and from thence came to <HI>Prag,</HI> or <HI>Prague,</HI> the Capital and Royal City of the Kingdom of <HI>Bohemia.</HI> The <HI>Walls</HI> of this City &s;eem to enclo&s;e the greate&s;t Citcuit of ground of any I have &s;een in <HI>Germany,</HI> but the Hills and void &s;paces within it take up a large Tract, and therein it is like the City of <HI>Lyon</HI> in <HI>France;</HI> it is &s;eated upon the River <HI>Muldau,</HI> by the <HI>Bohemians</HI> named <HI>Ultaue,</HI> a large rapid River, ari&s;ing in the South part of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and before at arriveth at <HI>Prague,</HI> receiveth the River <HI>Sar&s;ua</HI> and the <HI>Watta</HI> into it; and Northward of <HI>Prague</HI> the River <HI>Egra,</HI> and joyneth with the <HI>Elbe.</HI></P>
<P>This great place con&s;i&s;teth of three Towns, named the <HI>Old,</HI> the <HI>New,</HI> and the <HI>Kleine Seitten,</HI> or <HI>le&s;&s;er Town.</HI> The <HI>old Town</HI> lieth upon the Ea&s;t of the River <HI>Muldau,</HI> is very populous, full of Buildings, private and pub|lick. Very con&s;iderable in this part is al&s;o the Univer&s;i|ty, wherein are great numbers of Students and Scholars, there being but one Univer&s;ity in <HI>Bohemia;</HI> many per&s;ons al&s;o re&s;orting thither from other Countries. It is &s;carce credible what is reported of the number of Scholars in <HI>Prague</HI> in former Ages, as hath been delivered by divers
<PB N="123" REF="69"> Authors. And <HI>Lewis du May,</HI> Coun&s;ellor unto the Duke of <HI>Wittenburg,</HI> affirmeth, That there are at pre&s;ent &s;carce &s;o many Students in all <HI>Germany,</HI> as there were at <HI>Prague</HI> in the year 1409. when they reckoned above Forty thou&s;and under the <HI>Rector&s;hip</HI> of <HI>John Hus. Charles</HI> the Fourth, Emperour, and King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> founded the <HI>Univer&s;ity</HI> of <HI>Prague,</HI> giving equal priviledges to the <HI>Bohemians, Polanders,</HI> and <HI>Germans:</HI> and when he would re|trench his favours towards Strangers, there went out of the Town in a weeks time twenty four thou&s;and Scholars, and a little after, &s;ixteen thou&s;and, whereby we may judge there were more Scholars in <HI>Prague</HI> than other per&s;ons in &s;ome great Cities. There are al&s;o in this <HI>old Town</HI> di|vers <HI>Colledges</HI> and <HI>Cloy&s;ters.</HI> The <HI>Je&s;uites</HI> have a fair, hand&s;ome <HI>Colledge,</HI> near unto the <HI>Bridge,</HI> but the <HI>Build|ings</HI> of the <HI>old Town</HI> are inferiour to tho&s;e of the <HI>le&s;&s;er Town.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>new Town</HI> is large, and together with the River, encompa&s;&s;eth the <HI>old,</HI> and is divided from it by a large <HI>Trench</HI> or <HI>Ditch,</HI> in o which they can let in the River. The <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> have a <HI>Cloy&s;ter</HI> of <HI>Franci&s;cans</HI> near unto an old <HI>Tower</HI> in the <HI>Wall</HI> of the <HI>old Town.</HI> The <HI>Je&s;uites</HI> have al&s;o be|gun a large <HI>Cloy&s;ter,</HI> which, if fini&s;hed according to its beginning and de&s;ign, will be very &s;pacious and noble. They are now making <HI>Ba&s;tions</HI> about the <HI>Town</HI> at one end thereof; there is al&s;o a <HI>Citadel,</HI> but not fini&s;hed, at <HI>Wi&s;&s;e|raht,</HI> or <HI>Wi&s;&s;egrade,</HI> formerly the Seat of the Princes of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and al&s;o of the famous Prince&s;s <HI>Libu&s;&s;a,</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Crocus,</HI> and Wife unto <HI>Primi&s;laus.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Kleine Seitten,</HI> or <HI>le&s;&s;er Prague,</HI> far exceedeth the other for plea&s;antne&s;s and beauty of Buildings and fair Palaces. This part lieth We&s;tward of the River <HI>Mul|daw,</HI> which between this and the <HI>old Town,</HI> is pa&s;&s;able by a &s;trong <HI>Stone-bridge,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ixteen great Arches,
<PB N="124" REF="70"> being about Seventeen hundred foot long, and Thirty five foot broad, and two open Gates under two high Towers of Stone at each end. A great part of this Town lieth high, and upon the Hill &s;tandeth <HI>Hrat&s;chin,</HI> or <HI>Upper Prague,</HI> and a Summer Hou&s;e of the Emperours, be&s;ides a Magnificent Palace of the Emperours, as King of <HI>Bohemia;</HI> and by it a fair <HI>Cathedral Church</HI> dedicated to St. <HI>Veit,</HI> fir&s;t built by St. <HI>Wence&s;laus,</HI> Duke of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> 923. from whence the Town and River is be&s;t viewed. In this Church are divers <HI>old Monuments</HI> for great Per|&s;ons; as for <HI>Pogiebrachius</HI> a <HI>Bohemian</HI> King, <HI>Wence&s;laus, Rodolphus</HI> the Second, <HI>Charles</HI> the Fourth, <HI>Ladi&s;laus, Maximilian</HI> the Second, and other <HI>Arch-Dukes</HI> and <HI>Em|perours.</HI> There are al&s;o many Hou&s;es of the <HI>Nobility</HI> in this part of the City. The Palace and Garden of <HI>Colare|do</HI> is exceeding neat, though &s;mall. But I was mo&s;t plea|&s;ed with the Palace of Count <HI>Wallen&s;teyn,</HI> Duke of <HI>Fried|land,</HI> General unto the Emperour <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Second, who being &s;u&s;pected to U&s;urp that Kingdom, was after|wards killed at <HI>Egra.</HI> This Palace was built upon the Ruins of an hundred Hou&s;es, purpo&s;ely plucked down to make room for it; wherein the Hall is large, the Gar|den hand&s;ome; upon one &s;ide whereof there is a place to manage Hor&s;es, and near unto it a Fi&s;h-pond: in ano|ther part there is a noble <HI>Aviary</HI> with a Garden and Trees in it, after the manner of the <HI>Aviary</HI> of Prince <HI>Doria</HI> at <HI>Genoa,</HI> which is eighty paces long, and eighteen broad. The Stable is large, and worth the &s;eeing, wherein there is a <HI>Marble Pillar</HI> between each Hor&s;e, and for every Hor&s;e there is placed in a nich of the Wall a Rack of Steel, and Manger of Marble, and over his Head hangeth a Picture of the Hor&s;e, as big as the Life, with his Name under it. Among the re&s;t, I ob&s;erved that a Bay-hor&s;e had for his Name <HI>Monte d'Oro,</HI> a Mare, <HI>Bella donna,</HI> ano|ther
<PB N="125" REF="70"> <HI>E&s;pagnoletta,</HI> and his mo&s;t beloved Hor&s;e was named <HI>Mas Querido.</HI></P>
<P>Some have thought that the be&s;t <HI>high German</HI> is &s;poken in this part of <HI>Prague;</HI> and there living &s;o many of the Nobility and great Per&s;ons, it is not to be wondred at, that their Language is better than ordinary. But the common Language of <HI>Bohemia</HI> is a Dialect of the <HI>Sclavoni|an,</HI> though very many &s;peak al&s;o <HI>High dutch,</HI> as we found in all our pa&s;&s;age through that Country. <HI>Koning&s;mark</HI> being with his Forces on the Frontiers of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> a di&s;contented Colonel of the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> came unto him, making it probable that he might &s;urprize <HI>Hrat&s;chin,</HI> and the le&s;&s;er &s;ide of <HI>Prague,</HI> which he &s;uddainly attempted, and &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully, that he &s;urprized many Officers, and old <HI>Colaredo</HI> in his Bed, getting &s;o great a Booty, that he could &s;carce carry it away.</P>
<P>A part of <HI>Prague</HI> is inhabited by Jews, and called the <HI>Jews Town;</HI> there are no &s;mall number of them, and ma|ny rich, as trading in all Commodities, and have good skill in Jewels, and &s;everal &s;orts of Stones digged out of the <HI>Mines</HI> in <HI>Bohemia:</HI> I bought &s;ome <HI>Bohemian Topazes</HI> of them, neatly cut and well-figured, and &s;ome which were very large and clear, were at the rate of &s;even or eight <HI>Dollars.</HI> During my &s;tay here, I had a great de&s;ire to have &s;aluted <HI>Johannes Marcus-Marci,</HI> a famous Phy&s;ici|an and Philo&s;opher of <HI>Prague,</HI> and al&s;o to have induced him to a Corre&s;pondence with the <HI>Royal Society,</HI> but I under&s;tood that he had left this World, to the great grief of Learned Men in the&s;e and other parts.</P>
<P>Many here do &s;peak &s;till of <HI>John Hus</HI> and <HI>Jerome</HI> of <HI>Prague,</HI> and I have &s;een <HI>Silver Medals</HI> of them. They were &s;urely very notable men; and I &s;hall only &s;et down what <HI>Aeneas Sylvius,</HI> or Pope <HI>Pius</HI> the Second &s;aid of them. <HI>Jo|hannes aetate major &amp; authoritate, doctrin&acirc; &amp; facundi&acirc; &s;u|perior

None of the old Philo&s;ophers endured their death with &s;uch a courageous mind as the&s;e the fire.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Author compareth <HI>Prague</HI> unto the City of <HI>Florence</HI> in <HI>Tu&s;cany,</HI> wherefore having &s;een both places, I cannot omit to &s;ay &s;omething. I had a view of the Ci|ty of <HI>Florence</HI> from the top of the <HI>Domo,</HI> or <HI>Cathedral,</HI> and of <HI>Prague</HI> from the Church of St. <HI>Veit,</HI> upon the Hill in the le&s;&s;er Town: <HI>Prague</HI> &s;eemed to my eye to contain a far greater Circuit than <HI>Florence;</HI> it &s;eemed al&s;o more populous, and to exceed it very much in the number of People, the Streets larger, and the Windows of Palaces and fair Hou&s;es being of Gla&s;s, looked not &s;o tatterdly as the ragged Paper Windows of <HI>Florence.</HI> The River <HI>Arno,</HI> which runs through <HI>Florence,</HI> is not to be compa|red with the <HI>Muldau</HI> at <HI>Prague,</HI> having run about an hun|dred miles from its Head. The large, ma&s;&s;y, long Stone-Bridge exceedeth any of, if not all, the four Bridges of <HI>Flo|rence.</HI> The Emperours Palace al&s;o upon the Hill is very &s;tately: But as for the well-paved Streets of <HI>Florence,</HI> the <HI>Domo</HI> or <HI>Cathedral</HI> with black and white Marble, with a <HI>Cupola,</HI> &s;econd only to that of St. <HI>Peters</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> for the incomparable <HI>Chappel</HI> of St. <HI>Laurence,</HI> and the <HI>Dukes
<PB N="127" REF="71"> Gallery</HI> and <HI>Rarities,</HI> I mu&s;t confe&s;s I &s;aw not any thing in <HI>Prague</HI> which an&s;wered them. At <HI>Wei&s;&s;enberg,</HI> or the <HI>white Hill</HI> near <HI>Prague,</HI> that deciding Battel was fought <HI>Novemb.</HI> 8. 1620. between <HI>Frederick</HI> Prince <HI>Palatine</HI> of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> elected King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and the Forces of the Emperour <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Second, which gave &s;uch a deep blow unto the <HI>Prote&s;tant Party,</HI> wherein &s;o many of <HI>Frederick</HI>'s Forces were &s;lain and drowned in the River in their &s;light, wherein al&s;o that famous Commander <HI>Pa|penheim</HI> was found lying among the dead, who notwith|&s;tanding died not of his wounds, but was re&s;erved to end his days with the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> in the memorable Battel of <HI>Lutzen.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Prague</HI> I de&s;igned to pa&s;s by water down the <HI>Muldaw,</HI> which uniteth with the <HI>Elbe</HI> about <HI>Melnick,</HI> and &s;o down the <HI>Elbe</HI> unto <HI>Hamburg.</HI> But the Winter advan|cing, and the Weather proving cold, the Boats did not go as in Summer, and therefore I took my Journey by Land, and leaving <HI>Prague</HI> and the <HI>Muldau</HI> on the right hand, I pa&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t day to <HI>Zagethal,</HI> the next to <HI>We|luerne,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Budin</HI> and <HI>Laba&s;itz</HI> upon the <HI>Elbe.</HI> Ha|ving pa&s;&s;ed over the <HI>Egra,</HI> a con&s;iderable River, ari&s;ing not far from the City of <HI>Egra,</HI> and at la&s;t running into the <HI>Elbe;</HI> the next day by the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Krieg&s;tein,</HI> or <HI>Warre&s;tone,</HI> &s;eated upon a high &s;teep Rock, I came to <HI>Au&s;ig,</HI> a &s;mall City not far from the <HI>Elbe,</HI> having little remarkable in it, like many other &s;mall Cities of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and &s;o forward to <HI>Nolndorff,</HI> where we lodged upon Mount <HI>Knin&s;berg,</HI> the day after we entred into <HI>Mi&s;nia,</HI> pa&s;&s;ing by <HI>Peter&s;wald,</HI> and <HI>Hellendorff</HI> the fir&s;t Village in <HI>Mi&s;nia,</HI> and <HI>Ki&s;ibel,</HI> where are <HI>Iron Mines</HI> about eigh|teen Fathoms deep, and <HI>Iron works.</HI></P>
<P>We now under&s;tood that <HI>Bohemia</HI> was a larger Country than we expected; it lieth round, and &s;ome &s;ay it is three
<PB N="128" REF="72"> days po&s;tage over; others that the Diameter extendeth two hundred miles. From <HI>Igla</HI> upon the Confines unto <HI>Hellendorff,</HI> it took me nine days Journey in <HI>November</HI> by <HI>Coach,</HI> not reckoning the time I &s;taid at <HI>Prague.</HI> In many places there are very ill Pa&s;&s;ages, and &s;o rudely mended with great Trees, laid &s;ide by &s;ide, that they are often very trouble&s;ome to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>We travelled afterwards towards <HI>Dre&s;den,</HI> in a fruitful Country, wherein were many <HI>Deer</HI> in mo&s;t parts of the way, in &s;ight of the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Pilnitz,</HI> a &s;trong place, and &s;eated high. I could not but ca&s;t an eye on the <HI>Rocks</HI> behind us in the Fore&s;t of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> which looked like the Ruines of a Wall which formerly enclo&s;ed <HI>Bohemia,</HI> which Country is de&s;cribed with a Fore&s;t or Woods round about it. But I confe&s;s I did not really perceive that there was &s;uch a Wood round about it as is common|ly &s;et forth in <HI>Mapps;</HI> only both within, and al&s;o in many parts of the Borders, there are great Woods which are conceived to have been part of the <HI>Hercinian Fore&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Bohemians</HI> are a &s;trong, &s;tout, and hardy People, make good Souldiers, and have made great wars both at home and abroad; and <HI>Hi&s;tories</HI> are full of their warlike Exploits. The chief <HI>Magazine</HI> of the King is at <HI>Egra,</HI> a &s;trong City, accounted the Second of <HI>Bohemia.</HI> The Country affordeth al&s;o lu&s;ty and &s;trong Hor&s;es. The common &s;ort of People are boy&s;terous, rough, and quarrel|&s;ome, e&s;pecially in drink, whereto they are too much addicted. The Nobility and Gentry are civil and kind unto Strangers. There are many great Families of the Nobility, among which that of <HI>Ro&s;enberg</HI> and <HI>Popel</HI> is an|cient, and of high e&s;teem. Since the unhappy accepting of the Crown by <HI>Frederick</HI> Count <HI>Palatine,</HI> and the ill &s;ucce&s;s upon it, there hath been a great alteration in this Country, both as to People and their Manners; for there|upon
<PB N="129" REF="72"> many thou&s;ands left the Kingdom, and many who re|mained, turned their Religion. And the Emperours have u&s;ed the like &s;everity upon others in their Hereditary Dominions.</P>
<P>The next con&s;iderable place we came unto was <HI>Dre&s;|den</HI> in <HI>Mi&s;nia,</HI> as well worth the &s;eeing, as almo&s;t any Town in <HI>Germany. Dre&s;den</HI> is the Seat and Re&s;idence of the Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> &s;eated upon the River <HI>Elbe,</HI> over which there is a very noble Stone-bridge of Seventeen Arches. The City is very well fortified after the Mo|dern way, the <HI>Ba&s;tions Reve&s;tues,</HI> and in each <HI>Ba&s;tion</HI> a <HI>Cavallier:</HI> It hath al&s;o a large <HI>Trench</HI> or <HI>Ditch</HI> about it, in &s;ome places double; and the River <HI>Elbe</HI> addeth unto its &s;trength. The Walls are very &s;trong: and they &s;ay, that when the fir&s;t Stone was laid to build them, there was placed in the Earth a <HI>Silver Cup</HI> gilded, a <HI>Book</HI> of the <HI>Laws,</HI> and another of <HI>Coyns,</HI> and three <HI>Gla&s;&s;es</HI> filled with <HI>Wine.</HI> It hath al&s;o three Gates. The places mo&s;t worth the &s;eeing are the&s;e: The <HI>Italian</HI> Garden in the Suburbs; the <HI>Hunters Hou&s;e</HI> in the <HI>old Town</HI> beyond the <HI>River;</HI> the <HI>Electors Palace;</HI> his <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> for <HI>wild Bea&s;ts;</HI> his <HI>Stable|hou&s;e</HI> and <HI>Ar&s;enal,</HI> of which I &s;hall &s;et down &s;ome things ob&s;ervable in their kind. In the <HI>Electors Palace,</HI> the <HI>Hall</HI> is very large, and hand&s;omely painted with Cities, Gy|ants, and the Habits of &s;everal Nations, and &s;et out with &s;even large branched Candle&s;ticks: But that which af|fordeth the greate&s;t delight is his <HI>Kun&s;tkammer, Art-Chamber,</HI> or <HI>Collection of Rarities,</HI> both of <HI>Art</HI> and <HI>Na|ture.</HI> In the fir&s;t Partition are to be &s;een all manner of well-made <HI>In&s;truments</HI> belonging to mo&s;t <HI>Trades,</HI> as <HI>Joyners, Turners, Barbers, Smiths, Chirurgeons,</HI> and o|ther <HI>Artificers: In&s;truments</HI> to force open <HI>Doors, Che&s;ts, &amp;c.</HI> In the other Chambers the&s;e and the like are ob&s;er|vable.</P>

<P>Dr. <HI>Luthers</HI> Holiday was kept when I was there. The chief Church is very fair: They preach every morning at &s;even a Clock. The <HI>Lutheran</HI> women mourn in <HI>white,</HI> as others do in <HI>Black:</HI> and the woman of the Hou&s;e doth ordinarily &s;ay Grace in&s;tead of the man. The be&s;t <HI>High|dutch</HI> is &s;poken in this place, and other parts of <HI>Mi&s;nia,</HI> which is a very plea&s;ant fruitful Country, and full of good Towns and Villages.</P>
<P>Leaving this noble place, I took not the neare&s;t Road, but turned out of the way unto <HI>Freiberg,</HI> a place noted for <HI>Silver Mines;</HI> whereof I had read &s;omething in <HI>A|gricola,</HI> and heard very much in the&s;e parts. About an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> mile or two from <HI>Freiberg,</HI> there are many remar|kable <HI>Mines.</HI> I took notice of three of them: One called <HI>Auff den hohen berg,</HI> or <HI>upon the high Hill,</HI> which is the deepe&s;t in the&s;e parts, as being &s;eventy &s;even of their <HI>Fathoms</HI> deep; each of their <HI>Fathoms</HI> contains twelve of their <HI>Ells,</HI> and three of their <HI>Ells</HI> makes one of our <HI>Fa|thoms.</HI> So that the depth of this <HI>Mine</HI> exceedeth any of tho&s;e wherein I was in <HI>Hungary.</HI> There is another <HI>Mine</HI> called <HI>Himmelfur&s;t,</HI> or the <HI>Prince of Heaven,</HI> where|in not long &s;ince there was <HI>Ore</HI> found &s;o rich, as in an hundred pounds weight to contain an hundred and thirty Marks of <HI>Silver,</HI> or &s;ixty five pounds in the hundred, but there was not much of it: And where the <HI>Veyns</HI> are riche&s;t, they are ob&s;erved to be thine&s;t, about two &s;in|gers broad; but the ordinary <HI>Ore</HI> is but poor, holding an ounce, or an ounce and a half, in an hundred pounds weight; and if it holdeth but half an ounce they work it. Nor is this much to be wondered at, for in the va&s;t rich <HI>Mines</HI> of <HI>Peru</HI> and <HI>Chili,</HI> they will work the <HI>Silver Ore</HI> which containeth four or five ounces in a hundred pound
<PB N="135" REF="78"> weight, and ten or twelve ounces is the ordinary rate of the common <HI>Ore</HI> of that rich Mountain of <HI>Poto&s;i,</HI> out of which Hill alone, if we believe <HI>Albero Alon&s;o Barba,</HI> Cu|rate of the Pari&s;h of St. <HI>Bernard</HI> in that City, there hath been more <HI>Silver</HI> taken than would cover all <HI>Mi&s;nia</HI> o|ver and over: For thus he &s;aith, Poto&s;i <HI>hath already yielded between four and five hundred Millions of pieces of Eight.</HI> A quantity &s;ufficient to make &s;uch another Hill of <HI>Silver:</HI> It is hard to form a conception equal unto &s;o exorbitant a heap of Riches; but the better to help our imagination herein, know, that if the Ground were cove|red with &s;o many pieces of Eight, laid as clo&s;e to one another as is po&s;&s;ible, they would take up the &s;pace of &s;ix|ty Leagues &s;quare.</P>
<P>Here at <HI>Freiberg</HI> they have many ways to open the <HI>Ore</HI> whereby it may be melted; as by <HI>Lead</HI> and a &s;ort of <HI>Sil|ver Ore</HI> which holds <HI>Lead</HI> in it. They have al&s;o <HI>Sulphur Ore</HI> found here, which after it is burned, doth help much towards the fu&s;ion of <HI>Metals:</HI> And be&s;ides the&s;e, <HI>Slich,</HI> or pounded and wa&s;hed <HI>Ore;</HI> and <HI>Slacken,</HI> which is the Dro&s;s or Cake, or Skum taken out of the <HI>Vortiegel,</HI> or <HI>Pan</HI> which receiveth the <HI>melted Minerals</HI> let out at the bottom of the <HI>melting Furnace.</HI> Their <HI>Treib&s;hearth,</HI> or <HI>driving Furnace,</HI> where the <HI>Litharge</HI> is driven off, agreeth better with the Figure of it in <HI>Agricola,</HI> than tho&s;e of <HI>Hungary;</HI> &s;ome of the <HI>Litharge</HI> is green: Their <HI>Buck|work</HI> and their <HI>Engines</HI> which pound the <HI>Ore,</HI> the <HI>Coal,</HI> and <HI>Clay,</HI> are al&s;o very neat. Much of their <HI>Ore</HI> is wa&s;hed, e&s;pecially the poore&s;t, and that which is mixed with <HI>&s;tones, quarts,</HI> or <HI>&s;parrs.</HI></P>
<P>This is peculiar in their working, that they burn the pounded and wa&s;hed <HI>Ore</HI> in the <HI>Roa&s;thearth,</HI> before they melt it in the <HI>Smeltzoven,</HI> or <HI>melting Furnace.</HI></P>

But I &s;hall omit the De&s;cription of it, becau&s;e it is &s;et down in divers Books, and it cannot be &s;o well de|&s;cribed as &s;hown to the Eye.</P>
<P>I &s;aw al&s;o another <HI>Mine,</HI> called <HI>Auff der Hal&s;brucker,</HI> about eighty of our <HI>Fathoms</HI> deep, and much worked: They have divers &s;orts of <HI>Ore;</HI> but they contain either <HI>Silver</HI> and <HI>Copper, Silver</HI> and <HI>Lead,</HI> or all three; but they work them only for <HI>Silver.</HI> They have divers <HI>damps</HI> in the&s;e <HI>Mines,</HI> where it is deep. The <HI>Mines</HI> are cold where the outward Air comes in; but where not, warm. The greate&s;t trouble they have is by du&s;t, which &s;poileth their <HI>Lungs</HI> and <HI>Stomachs,</HI> and frets their <HI>Skins.</HI> But they are not &s;o much troubled with water; and have ve|ry good <HI>Engins</HI> to draw the water out.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sulphur,</HI> or <HI>Brim&s;tone Ore</HI> which is found here, is al&s;o rich; it is hard and &s;tony, as other <HI>Ores</HI> are: that which hath <HI>red &s;pots</HI> is accounted the be&s;t. They u&s;e a peculiar <HI>Furnace</HI> to melt the <HI>Brim&s;tone</HI> from the <HI>Ore;</HI> &s;ome whereof yieldeth three pounds of <HI>Sulphur</HI> out of an hundred weight of <HI>Ore,</HI> which as it melteth runneth out of the <HI>Furnace</HI> into water, or the Exhalations from the <HI>Ore</HI> near or in the Fire, are conden&s;ed into <HI>Brim&s;tone</HI> by the Surface of the Water placed to receive it; this is once again melted and purified. Some of the <HI>Brim&s;tone Ore</HI> containeth <HI>Silver,</HI> &s;ome <HI>Copper,</HI> and &s;ome both in a &s;mall proportion.</P>
<P>After the <HI>Sulphur</HI> is melted from the <HI>Ore,</HI> the remain|der &s;erveth for two u&s;es; that is, either for the melting of <HI>Silver,</HI> or for the making of <HI>Vitriol:</HI> To the former only

<P>The other u&s;e, and which is more con&s;iderable, is for the making of <HI>Vitriol,</HI> or <HI>Coppero&s;e</HI> in this manner: They take the <HI>Ore</HI> out of which the <HI>Brim&s;tone</HI> hath been already melted, and burn it once again, or let it &s;till burn in the open Air; then putting it into a large Fatt, they pour water upon it, &s;o as to imbibe and drink in the <HI>Vitriol;</HI> this Water is afterwards boyled to a &s;ufficient height, and let out into the Coolers, where &s;ticks are &s;et in it, as in the making of <HI>Sugar Candy:</HI> The pure&s;t Chry&s;tallized <HI>Vitriol</HI> &s;ticks unto the wood, the re&s;t to the &s;ides and bot|tom.

Some of the <HI>Cadmia</HI> is blacki&s;h and dark brown; and there are <HI>Fluores</HI> between the Cavities of the <HI>Stone</HI> hand|&s;omely figured, but mo&s;t of a <HI>blacki&s;h colour.</HI> The <HI>works</HI>
