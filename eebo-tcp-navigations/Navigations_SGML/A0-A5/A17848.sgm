<P>The certaine and inward knowledge of that which is

any thing detracted more from the dignitie of our tongue,

wi&s;e <HI>Romans</HI> thought no &s;mall part of their honour to con|&s;i&s;t
in the honour of their language, e&s;teeming it a di&s;ho|nour
to an&s;wer any forraine in his owne language. As for
a long time the Engli&s;h placed in the Borrough townes of
<HI>Ireland</HI> and <HI>Wales,</HI> would admit neither Iri&s;h nor Wel&s;h a|mong

<P>As for the <HI>Mono&s;yllables</HI> &s;o rife in our tongue which were

and borrowed forraine words in ours, as in any other
what&s;oever. Notwith&s;tanding the diver&s;iue of Nations
which have &s;warmed hither, and the practi&s;e of the Nor|mans,
who as a monument of their Conque&s;t, would have
yoaked the Engli&s;h vnder their tongue, as they did vnder
their command, by compelling them to teach their children
in &s;chooles nothing but French, by &s;etting downe their
lawes in the Norman-French, and enforcing them mo&s;t ri|gorou&s;ly
to pleade and to be impleaded in that tongue one|ly,
for the &s;pace of three hundred yeares, vntill K. <HI>Edward</HI>
the third enlarged them fir&s;t from that bondage. Since which
time, our language hath ri&s;en by little, and the proverbe pro|ved
vntrue, which &s;o long had beene v&s;ed, <HI>Iacke would be a
gentleman, if he could &s;peake any French.</HI></P>
<P>Heerein is a notable argument of our Ance&s;tors &s;ted|fa&s;tnes
in e&s;teeming and retaining their owne tongue. For
as before the Conque&s;t they mi&s;liked nothing more in K.
<HI>Edward</HI> the Confe&s;&s;or, than that he was Frenchified, &amp; ac|counted
the de&s;ire of forraine language, then to be a fore|token
of the bringing in of forraine powers, which indeede
happened. In like manner after the Conque&s;t, notwith&s;tan|ding
tho&s;e enforcements of the Normans in &s;upplanting it,
and the nature of men, which is mo&s;t pliable with a curious
iolitie to fa&s;hion &amp; frame them&s;elves according to the man|ners,
attyre, and language of the Conquerours. Yet in all
that long &s;pace of 300. yeares, they intermingled very few
French-Norman words, except &s;ome termes of law, hun|ting,
hawking, and dicing, whenas wee within the&s;e 60.
yeares, have incorporated &s;o many Latine and French, as
the third part of our tongue con&s;i&s;teth now in them. But
like them&s;elves, continue &s;till tho&s;e old Engli&s;hmen which

places, and not to per&s;ons in their &s;ignifications, if any will
marke the Locall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">erminations which I lately &s;pecified.

<P>And I doubt not but they will confe&s;&s;e that Townes

<P>It may al&s;o be prooved that many places which nowe
have Lordes denominated of them, had Lordes and ow|ners

be verified, which when he heard of, Engli&s;hmen called
God and Divell, &s;aide, that the Engli&s;h borrowed names
from all things what&s;oever, good or bad.</P>
<P>It might be heere que&s;tioned, whether the&s;e &s;urnames
were a&s;&s;umed and taken at the fir&s;t by the per&s;ons them|&s;elves,
or impo&s;ed and given vnto them by others. It may
a&s;well &s;eeme that the locall names of per&s;ons were partely
taken vp by them&s;elves, if they were owners of the place,
as given by the people, who have the &s;overaignty of words
and names, as they did in the Nicke-names before Sur|names
were in v&s;e. For who would have named him&s;elfe,
Peaceable, Vnready, Without-land, Beauclerke, Strong|bow,
Gagtooth, Blanch-mayne, Bo&s;&s;ue, i. Crook-backe,
but the concurrent voyce of the people, as the women
neighbours gave the name to <HI>Obed</HI> in the booke of <HI>Ruth;</HI>
and likewi&s;e in Surnames. In the&s;e pretty names, as I may
terme them, from floures, fi&s;hes, birdes, habitudes, &amp;c: it
may bee thought that they came from Nur&s;es in former
times heere, as very many, or rather mo&s;t in <HI>Ireland</HI> and
<HI>Wales</HI> doe at this pre&s;ent. The&s;e Nicke-names of one &s;il|lable
turned to &s;urnames, as <HI>Dickes, Nickes, Toms, Hobbes,
&amp;c.</HI> may al&s;o &s;eeme to proceed from Nur&s;es, to their Nur|&s;lings;
or from fathers and mai&s;ters to their boyes and &s;er|vants.

one &s;hould have a donation &s;urmounting a thou&s;and
crownes, vpon the &s;ame condition. But to retyre to our
purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Not a few have a&s;&s;umed the names of their fathers
Baronies, as in former times the i&s;&s;ue of <HI>Richard Fitz-Gil|bert,</HI>
tooke the name of <HI>Clare,</HI> which was their Barony: and
in late time, &s;ince the <HI>Suttons</HI> came to the Barony of <HI>Dud|ley,</HI>
all their i&s;&s;ue tooke the name of <HI>Dudleyes:</HI> that I may
omit others. The di&s;like of others hath cau&s;ed al&s;o a
change of names, for King <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t, di&s;liking the
iteration of <HI>Fitz,</HI> commanded the Lord <HI>Iohn Fitz-Robert,</HI>
a mo&s;t ancient Baron,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. Mona&s;terii Sibeton.</NOTE> (who&s;e Ance&s;tours had continued
their Surnames by their fathers Chri&s;tian names,) to leave
that manner, and to be called <HI>Iohn Clavering,</HI> which was
the capitall &s;eate of his Barony. And in this time, many that
had followed that cour&s;e of naming by <HI>Fitz,</HI> tooke them
one &s;etled name, and retained it as <HI>Fitz Walter,</HI> and others.</P>
<P>Al&s;o at that time the names of <HI>Thom&s;on, Richard&s;on,
Will&s;on,</HI> and other of that forme began to be &s;etled, which
before had varied according to the name of the father. <HI>Ed|ward</HI>
the fourth likewi&s;e (as I have heard,) loving &s;ome
who&s;e name was <HI>Picard,</HI> would often tell them that hee
loved them well, but not their names, wherevpon &s;ome of
them changed their names: and I have heard that one of
them which tooke the name of <HI>Ruddle,</HI> being the place of
his birth in that re&s;pect. And in late yeares in the time of
King <HI>Henry</HI> the eight, an ancient wor&s;hipfull gentleman
of <HI>Wales,</HI> being called at the panniell of Iury by the name
of <HI>Thomas Ap William, Ap Thomas, Ap Richard, Ap Hoel,
Ap Evan &V;aghan, &amp;c.</HI> was advi&s;ed by the Iudge to leave
that old manner. Wherevpon he after called him&s;elfe <HI>Mo|ston,</HI>
according to the name of his principall hou&s;e, and left
that Surname to his po&s;terity.</P>
<P>Offices have brought new names to divers families, as
<PB N="128" REF="69">
when <HI>Edward Fitz-Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">bald,</HI> of <HI>Ireland,</HI>
the Earles of <HI>Ormond</HI> and others de&s;cended from them,
tooke the name of <HI>Butler.</HI> So the di&s;tinct families of the
<HI>Con&s;tables</HI> in the County of <HI>Yorke,</HI> are &s;aide to have ta|ken
that name, from &s;ome of their Ance&s;tours which bare
the office of Con&s;tables of &s;ome Ca&s;tles. In Like manner
the <HI>Stewards, Mar&s;halls, Spencers.</HI> That I may &s;ay nothing
of &s;uch as for well acting on the &s;tage, have carried away
the names of the per&s;onages which they acted, and have
lo&s;t their owne names among the people.</P>
<P>Schollers pride hath wrought alteration in &s;ome names
which have beene &s;weetned in &s;ound, by drawing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">hem to
the Latine <HI>Analog<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">.</HI> As that notable Non-re&s;ident in our
fathers time Doctor <HI>Magnus,</HI> who being a foundling at
<HI>Newark</HI> vppon <HI>Trent,</HI> where hee erected a Grammer
&s;choole, was called by the people <HI>T. Among vs,</HI> for that he
was found among them: But he profiting in learning, tur|ned
<HI>Among vs,</HI> into <HI>Magnus,</HI> and was famous by that name,
not onely heere, but al&s;o in forraine places where he was
often Amba&s;&s;adour.</P>
<P>It were needele&s;&s;e to note heere againe, how many
have taken in former times the Chri&s;tian name of their
father, with prefixing of <HI>Fitz</HI> or <HI>Filz,</HI> as <HI>Fitz-bugh, Fitz-alan,
Fitz-william,</HI> or adding of <HI>Son,</HI> as <HI>Richard&s;on, Tom&s;on,
Iohn&s;on, &amp;c.</HI> and &s;o altered their Surnames if they had any.
Whereas divers ancient Gentlemen of <HI>England</HI> do beare
Coates of Armes, which by old roules and good proofes
are knowne to belong to other names and families, and
cannot make proofe that they matched with tho&s;e fami|lies,
it is worth ob&s;ervation, con&s;idering how religious
they were in elder times in keeping their owne Armes:
whether they were not of tho&s;e ancient hou&s;es who&s;e
Armes they beare, and have changed their names in re|&s;pect
of their habitation, or partitions and lands gotten by
their wives. As <HI>Pickering</HI> of the North, beareth Ermin a
Lion rampant Azure crowned, Or, which, as it is in the

the &s;ame Armes, may &s;eeme to haue beene of the &s;ame
&s;tocke, and to haue varied their names in diuers re&s;pects.</P>
<P>Finally, among the common people which &s;way all in
names, many Surnames haue bene changed in re&s;pect of
occupations, and not a few have beene changed in re&s;pect
of ma&s;ters, for in every place we &s;ee the youth very com|monly
called by the names of their ocupations, as <HI>Iohn</HI> Ba|ker,
<HI>Thomas</HI> Taylor, <HI>Will</HI> Butcher, <HI>Dic</HI> Barber, and many
by their ma&s;ters names, as <HI>Iohn Pickering, Thomas Watkins,
Nicholas French,</HI> whenas they &s;erved mai&s;ters of tho&s;e
names, which often were conveyed to their po&s;teritie, and
their owne Surnames altogether forgotten. Some other
cau&s;es of alteration of names may be found, as for crimes
committed when men have beene enforced to leave their
countries. But heereby it may be vnder&s;tood that an <HI>Alias</HI>
or double name cannot preiudice the hone&s;t: and it is
knowne that when Iudge <HI>Catiline</HI> tooke exception at one

name, &amp; came in with an <HI>Alias.</HI> The party asked him what
exception his Lord&s;hip could take to Ie&s;us Chri&s;t, Alias,
Ie&s;us of <HI>Nazareth.</HI></P>
<P>I doubt not but &s;ome men among vs in changing their

proove that hee did wrong, than even the name of his bare of|fice

And the fellow &s;eemed but a &s;eely &s;oule, and &s;ate &s;till, and &s;ayde
nothing; they made noreckoning of him, but &s;aide. We be agreed
now, come, let vs goe and give vp our verdict. Then when the
