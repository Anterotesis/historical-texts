<HEAD>TO THE KING'S Most Excellent Majesty.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Interest you have in the flourishing of Your Antient King|dom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> whose Crown is transmitted to You by an Hundred and eleven of your Ancestors, without ever having been on the Head of a Forraigner, emboldens the Author to lay the following Sheets at your Majesties Feet.</P>
<P>The design of them is to vindicate the Settlement of the <HI>Scots</HI> in <HI>Darien,</HI> and Your Majesties Justice in protecting them, against the O|blique Aspersions which are cast upon it in the <HI>Spanish</HI> Memorial.</P>
<P>The Soveraignty of the Crown of <HI>Scotland</HI> hath alwise been held Sacred by our Ancestors, who never were sparing of their Blood to de|fend it either from the Invasion of Foreigners, or the mean Compliance of some few of our Princes that were unworthie to wear it; and there|fore were either totally excluded from it, as the Family of <HI>Baliol,</HI> or oblig'd to reassert its Right when rescu'd out of the Hands of their E|nemies, as happen'd to our <HI>William I.</HI> and <HI>James I.</HI></P>
<P>Providence having now plac'd it on the Head of Your Majesty, whose Heroic Courage is known to all the World, our Nation should be unjust to Your Character to expect any thing less than that our Crown, which You receiv'd free and independent from Your Ancestors, should be trans|mitted by You with greater Advantages than ever to Your Successors.</P>
<P>Therefore it is, Great Sir, that a privat Subject of your Antient Kingdom takes the holdness to vindicate the Soveraignty and Dignity of Your Crown as Kings of <HI>Scots,</HI> and to put such as are Enemies to it in mind, that when <HI>Edward I,</HI> and <HI>II.</HI> of <HI>England</HI> invaded it, the <HI>Scotish</HI> Nation did gallantly defend it, advanced <HI>Robert Bruce</HI> to the
<PB REF="3">
Exclusion of <HI>Baliol</HI> the nearest Heir, and acquainted the Princes of <HI>Christendom</HI> that they did so in defence of their Independency; adding that they would expel <HI>Robert Bruce,</HI> if he offered to betray their Li|berty, and would never subject their Crown to that of <HI>England,</HI> whilst there were <HI>100 Scots men</HI> alive.</P>
<P>This being the fundamental Constitution of our Government, and the Condition on which that Prince and his Successors were admitted to Our Crown; they can in no wise be look'd upon as Friends to your Majesties Dignitie as King of <HI>Scots,</HI> who call in question what You enact in the Parliament of that Kingdom, or that offer to traverse it by contrary Proclamations.</P>
<P>We are Your Majesties Subjects as well as our Neighbours, and have an equal Right to share your Protection, which its hop'd they will at last be convinc'd it is their Interest to agree to in relation to our <HI>Ame|rican</HI> Settlement.</P>
<P>Your Majesty's Paternal Affection to the Kingdom of <HI>Scorland,</HI> hath discover'd it self in many Instances: nor is it to be desired or expected by our Nation, that it should any way interfere with the like Care and Affection, which is owing to our Brethren of <HI>England;</HI> but there is no reason that they should enjoy a Freedom of Trade throughout the World, and that we should be denied it.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">our Majesty in yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">r Gracious Proposals os an Union, gave sufficient Evidence of a Fatherly Concern for both Nations.

<HEAD>A <HI>DEFENCE</HI> of the Settlement of the <HI>SCOTS</HI> on the Isthmus of DARIEN in <HI>America</HI> With Ar|guments to prove, That it is the Interest of <HI>England</HI> to join with them, and to protect them in that Colony.</HEAD>
<P>THE Heads propos'd to be insisted upon in the following Sheers, ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">, <HI>The Legality of the</HI> SCOTS <HI>Establishment, The Advantage or Disadvantage that may redound from it to</HI> England: <HI>Whether the</HI> Scots <HI>without the Assistance of the</HI> English <HI>may be able to maintain their footing in</HI> America; <HI>and what, may probably be the Consequences, if the</HI> Scots <HI>should be oppos'd therein by the</HI> English, <HI>and miscarry in the Undertaking.</HI></P>
<P>The chief Objections against the Legality of their Establish|ment, ari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e from the Memorial delivered in against it to the King, by the Ambassad or Extraordinary of <HI>Spain, May</HI> 3, 1699. O, S, as follows:</P>
<Q><P>THE Under-Subscriber, Ambassador Extraordinary from his Catholick Majestie, finds himself oblig'd by express Orders, to represent to your Majesty, that the King his Master having receiv'd Information from different places, and last of all from the Governor of <HI>Havana,</HI> of the In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ult and Attempt of some <HI>Scots</HI> Ships, equip'd with Men and other things requisit, who design to settle themselves in his Majestres Sove|raign Demains in <HI>America,</HI> and particularly the Province of <HI>Da|rien.</HI> His Majesty receiv'd those Advices with very much dif|content, and looks upon the same as a Token of small Friend|ship, and as a Rupture of the Alliance betwixt the two Crowns (which his Majesty hath observed hitherto, and alwayes ob|serves
<PB N="2" REF="4">
very religiously, and from which so many Advantages and profits hath resulted both to your Majesty and you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> Sub|jects) as a Consequence of which good Correspondence, his Majestie did not expect such sudden Insults and Attempts by your Majesties Subjects, and that too in a time of Peace, with|out pretext (or any Cause) in the very heart o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> his Demains.</P>
<P>All that the King desires, is, That this may be represented to your Majesty, and that your Majesty may be acquainted, that he is very sensible of such Hostilities and unjust Procedures, a|gainst which his Majesty will take such Measures as he thinks convenient.</P></Q>
<P> Given at <HI>London, May</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">. 1699.</P>
<P>It were easie to make proper Remarks upon the Weakness, Insolence and ingratitude of this Memorial, but it is not worth while; all the World knows what the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> ows to his Majesty of <HI>Great Britain;</HI> and therefore a more civil Appli|cation might reasonably have been expected to a Prince, who hath not only saved the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> but prevented his Catho|lick Majesty from being insulted on his Throne at <HI>Madrid.</HI> But these things we pass over, and come to the chief point in the Me|morial, which is, <HI>That the</HI> Scots <HI>have posted themselves in the King of</HI> Spain'<HI>s Demains in</HI> America, <HI>contrary to the Allyance be|twixt the two Crowns.</HI> If this be proved to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">alse, then the cause of the Complaint ceases, and his Majesty of <HI>Great Britain</HI> hath reason to demand Satisfaction for the Affront offered thereby to his Justice and Soveraignty.</P>
<P>To prove the falshood of the Allegation, That the Province of <HI>Darien</HI> is part of the King of <HI>Spains</HI> Demains: It is positively denied by the <HI>SCOTS,</HI> who challenge the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to prove their Right to the said Province, either by <HI>Inheritance, M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">rriage, Donation, Purchase, Reversion, Surrender</HI> or <HI>Conquest;</HI> which being the only Titles by which they or any other People can claim a Right to those or any other Dominions, if the <HI>Spaniards</HI> cannot make out their Right by those of any of those, their Claim must of consequence be null and void.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="4">It is evident that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> cannot pretend a Tittle to that Countrey by Inheritance, Marti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">, or the Donation of Prince and People; and as to Conquest it would be ridiculous to al|leadge it; since the <HI>Dariens</HI> are in actual possession of their Liber|ty, and were never subdued, nor receiv'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ny <HI>Spanish</HI> Govern|or or Garison amongst them.

<P>Capt. <HI>Sharp</HI> in the Journal of his Expedition, published in Cap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> <HI>Hacke</HI>'s Collection of Voyages, gives an account, that in 1680 he landed at <HI>Golden Island</HI> with 330 Men, and being joyn'd by one of the <HI>Darien</HI> Princes, whom they call'd <HI>Emperor,</HI> and another to whom they gave the Tittle of <HI>King Golden&punc; Cap,</HI> with some hundreds of their Men, took <HI>Sancta Maria,</HI> attempted <HI>Panama,</HI> and made prize of several <HI>Spanish</HI> Ships; which is the more re|markable, because Capt. <HI>Sharp</HI> was afterwards tryed in <HI>England</HI> for Robbery and piracy on this very Account, but acquitted be|cause of his Commission from those <HI>Darien</HI> Princes: which is a plain Demonstration that the Government of <HI>England</HI> did then look upon <HI>Darein</HI> to be no way subject to <HI>Spain,</HI> whateve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> some who are Enemies to the SCOTS, do now say against the Legality of their Settlement in that Country.

<P><PB N="4" REF="5">We have likewise a large Account, and a full Confirmation of the War and perpetual Enmity betwixt the <HI>Dariens</HI> and the <HI>Spa|niards</HI> in the History of the Buccaneers of <HI>America, Vol. 2. Part</HI> 4. wrote by <HI>Basil Ringrose,</HI> who was one of their Company. There he in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">orms us that the <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>Darien,</HI> and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are commonly at War with one another; and that the Buccaneers were invited into that Countrey, and join'd by the <HI>Darien</HI> Prin|ces, Capt. <HI>Andrea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">,</HI> Captain <HI>Antonio,</HI> and the King of <HI>Darien,</HI> who assisted th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">m in the taking of <HI>Sancta Maria,</HI> au<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> their Attempt u|pon <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">anama;</HI> and the King whose Daughter the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had stole away, promised to join the Buccaneers with 50000 Men. This is the more remarkable, because those very Princes, or their Successors are now in League with the <HI>Scots,</HI> and have joy|fully receiv'd them into their Countrey. So that it is the strang|est Imposition that can be put upon any Nation, and one of the most audacious affronts that ever was put upon so Great a Prince as K <HI>William,</HI> for the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to pretend a Right to <HI>Darien,</HI> and accuse him of a B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">each of the Peace, because a Colony of his Subjects have settled themselves there; when it is so well known to the World that the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> has no manner of Title to that Province.</P>

and Insolence: So that Mr. <HI>Wafer</HI> tells us <HI>pag.</HI> 133. they allow a distinguishing Mark of Honour to him who has kill'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> <HI>Spaniard:</HI> and <HI>pag.</HI> 179. that <HI>Lacenta</HI> one of the chief of the <HI>Darien</HI> Princes, did in his converse with him, express his Sense and Resentment of the havock made by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the West of <HI>America,</HI> at their first coming thither.</P>
<P>It remains then that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> can lay no other claim to <HI>Darien</HI> but what they plead <HI>from the Pope's general Grant of</HI> Ame|rica, <HI>its being bounded by their Dominions, and the Treaties with</HI> England. which shall be considered in their Order.</P>
<P>To urge the Pope's Grant amongst Protestants is ridicolous, and amongst Papists themselves but precarious: but adm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">tting it were sufficient to justifie their Title, it is easie to prove that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have forf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ited all the Right that they can claim by vir|tue of that Grant.</P>
<P>The Church o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> <HI>Rome</HI> will not publickly own her power to grant a Right of Conquest, but in order to propagate the Faith, and not that neither, except the Infidel Prince or People be guilty of a breach of Treaty. So that the Pope's Grant with these Re|strictions is so far from establishing the Title of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that it plainly overth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ows it.</P>
<P>That the <HI>Indians</HI> were committed to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> by Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> the VI. on condition that they should teach them the Christian Religion, is proved by <HI>Don Bartholomew de las Casas</HI> Bishop of <HI>Chi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">pa, iu his Account of the first Voyages and Discoveries made by the</HI> Spaniards <HI>in</HI> America, <HI>and the Relation of their unpa|rallel a Cruelties,</HI> p. 165. and there he likewise owns, <Q>that their acquitting themselves so ill of that Commission, they ought to make Restitution of all they have taken from them under this pret<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">xt.</Q> And <HI>pag.</HI> 200, he charges them with breach of the Terms prescrib'd by the Apostolical Brief, tho Queen <HI>Isabella&punc;</HI> to whom it was granted earnestly entreated them to keep exactly to it. <HI>P.</HI> 218. he says that the Title of the King of <HI>Spain</HI> to the

<P>Having thus made it evident that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have no man|ner of Title or Right to <HI>Darien,</HI> it is Natural in the next place to shew that they themselves are guilty of the Breach of Treaty by proceeding in this Affair as they have done.</P>
<P>By the third Article of the Treaty between the Crowns of <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>Spain&punc;</HI> concluded at <HI>Madrid May</HI> 23. 1667. it is pro|vided, <HI>That if any Injury shall be done by either of the said Kings, or by the People or Subjects of either of them, to the People or Subjects of the other, against the Articles of that Alliance, or against common Right, there shall not therefore be given Letters of Reprisal, Marque or Countermarque, by any of the Confederates, until such time as Justice is follow'd in the ordinary Course of Law.</HI> Yet the <HI>Spaniards</HI> with|out any such Procedure, or offering in the least to prove their Title to <HI>Darien,</HI> present a virulent and huffi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">g Memorial, at the very first charging the King <HI>with want of Friendship, and a Breach of Alliance, and threatning to take such measures as they shall think meet:</HI> when their sickly Monarchy has not yet had time to breath, since rescu'd from the common danger, wherein <HI>Europe</HI> was involv'd, by the Arms of that very Prince whom they treat so ungratefully.</P>
<P>But this is not all; for contrary to the express Words of that same Treaty, they attack the <HI>Scots</HI> by Sea and Land, who had done them no Injury, but acquainted them that they came peaceably, without any hostile design against them or any other People; And
<PB N="9" REF="7">
were so generous as to reject the Motion of Capt. <HI>Andreas,</HI> one of the <HI>Darien</HI> Princes, and their Ally, when he offered to make them Masters of <HI>Panama,</HI> if they would but join him with 500 of their Men.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> have also, contrary to the <HI>10th</HI> and <HI>11th</HI> Arti|cles of the Treaty concluded at <HI>Madrid. July</HI> 18 1670, concern|ing <HI>America,</HI> detain'd the <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>English</HI> Prisoners who were forc'd ashoar at <HI>Carthagena</HI> by Shipwrack, tho all such practices be expresly provided against by the said Articles; and they have also violated the <HI>14th</HI> Article of that Treaty, which forbids Re|prisals, except in case of denying or unreasonably delaying Justice, From all which it is evident, that the King of <HI>Great Britain</HI> has just reason to demand Satisfaction of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> sor attacking his Subjects contrary to Treaty; and that the <HI>SCOTS</HI> being thus injuriously treated, may very lawfully, not only make Reprisals upon the <HI>Spaniards</HI> for themselves, but join with the King of <HI>Da|rien</HI> in taking <HI>Sancta Maria, Panama,</HI> or any other place helong|ing to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in that Countrey, of which the <HI>Dariens</HI> are Natural Lords, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Tyrannical Usurpers, as is pleaded by the King of <HI>Darien</HI> himself; and therefore he invit|ed the <HI>English</HI> Buccaneers to assist him to retake it: and by this Capt. <HI>Sawkins</HI> justified his proceedings in a Letter to the Gover|nor of <HI>Panama,</HI> asserting that the King of <HI>Darien</HI> was true Lord of <HI>Panama,</HI> and all the Countrey thereabouts; and that they came to assist him. <HI>History of Buccaneers,</HI> Vol. 2. part 4. p. 32. And we have mentioned before that Capt. <HI>Sharp,</HI> who was accused of Piracy, for that same Expedition, and succeeded <HI>Sawkins</HI> in his Command, was acquitted in <HI>England,</HI> because he had that Prince's Commission.</P>
<P>Having fully prov'd that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have no Title in <HI>Darien,</HI> it remains to be prov'd that the SCOTS have as good and just a Title to their Settlement there, as any People in the World can have; which may easily be demonstrated thus:</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="8">They were authorized by an Act of Parliament, and the Kings Letters Patent, <HI>to plant Colonies in</HI> Asia, Africa, <HI>or</HI> America, <HI>upon Places not inhabited, or any other Place by Consent of the Natives, not possest by any</HI> European <HI>Prince or State.</HI> Being provided with this Authority than which there cannot be a Greater, or one more duly and honestly limited, they equipp'd their Ships, and landed on the North side of the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>Darien</HI> in <HI>November</HI> 1698. where the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> as has been fully prov'd, never had any possession, and no other <HI>European</HI> Prince or State pretends any Claim to it. Being arriv'd there, they fairly obtained the Con|sent of the Princes and People of the Country, and particularly of Captain <HI>Andreas,</HI> who is the chief Man in that Tract; And after a solemn Treaty and Alliance deliberatly made, and wrote in <HI>Spanish,</HI> because the said Prince understands that Language, they peaceably enter upon their new Colony, without either Force or Fraud. So that they have religiously kept to the Con|ditions of the Act and Patent, which is a plain demonstration hat they have a just and legal Title to their Settlement. and a Right to the Protection of the Government, against the Attempts of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> or any other People whatsoever.</P>
<P>The next Topick to be insisted upon. is the Advantage or Dis|advantage that may redound to <HI>England</HI> from this Settlement. We shall begin with the Disadvantage which consists in the supposed Damage it may do to the Trade of <HI>England,</HI> and that it may, as is pretended, occasion a Rupture between them and <HI>Spain.</HI> To this we may easily reply, that being a distinct and independent Nation, we are not oblig'd to consult their Interest, any further than they consult ours; and that we have as much Reason to maintain this Colony, because of the Advantage it may bring to our selves, as they have to oppose it, because of the Disadvanta|ges that they fancy may arise from thence to <HI>England.</HI> But with|al we deny that it can be any damage to their Trade, which from that part of the World consists chiefly in Sugar and Tobacco, nei|ther of which are yet to be found in <HI>New Caledonia.</HI> But that which
<PB N="11" REF="8">
we look upon to be a compleat Answer to the Objection, is this, That they may be sharers with Us in the settlement if they please, and by consequence Partners in the Profits and Trade, and lay it under such Regulations as may prevent its endamaging the Com|merce of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>And whereas it is further objected, That by the great Immuni|ties and freedom granted to the SCOTS Company for so many Years, we shall be able to undersell the <HI>English</HI> Company forestal their Markets, and lessen his Majesties Customs; we answer, that this Objection is in a great measure obv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ated, since we do not now pretend to set up an <HI>East-India</HI> Trade; but admitting it were true, it will be to the general Advan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">age of the <HI>English</HI> Na|tion, since the Buyers are always more than the Sellers. It must certainly be better for the Kingdom in general, that every one who has occasion for Musl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">n or <HI>Indian</HI> Silks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> should have so many shillings <HI>per</HI> Yard or peice in their Pockets, than that some two or three Merchants should once in an Age get Money enough to make a Daughter or two a Countess or Dutchess. No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> can it be denied but it's better for <HI>England,</HI> that Housekeepers in general should save that Money to buy Provisions for their Fami|lies, which consumes our own Product, than that a dozen of Mer|chants should be enabled by the extravagant prices of those com|modities to keep their Coaches. Add to this, that the <HI>English</HI> if they please by joining with the <HI>SCOTS,</HI> may have an equal share of all those Immunities; and if there should be for some time a lessening of the King's Customs, of which there is at present no manner of prospect, it will be sufficiently made up in time to come by a large Addition, if that Colony prospers; so that the King's Bounty in that respect, is but like the bestowing of charge to improve barren or waste Ground, which will return with treble Interest to him or his Heirs.</P>

<P>Had we but seem'd to have made such Overtures, the <HI>English</HI> must needs have foreseen that the natural Consequences of such a design, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> it had taken effect, must have been these, <HI>viz</HI> the late King's Adherents in <HI>England</HI> would certainly have join'd

<P>To shew that this is not a mere Conjecture, that has no other ground but a Vision of the Brain, they may be pleased to consider the honourable Privileges granted US by their Ancestors, and some of the greatest Princes that ever swayed their Scepter, <HI>viz;</HI> King <HI>Edward</HI> and <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, who by the Consent of the States in Parliament assembled, enacted, <HI>That the</HI> Scots <HI>should be accounted Deniz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ns of</HI> England, <HI>and enjoy the same privileges with themselves, because of their frequent Intermarriages with the</HI> English, <HI>and that they did ever stand stoutly as one Man with them, for the common Utility of the Crown and Kingdom, against the</HI> Danes <HI>and</HI> Norwegians, <HI>fought it most valiantly and unanimously against the com|mon Enemy, and bore the burden of most fierce Wars in the Kingdom.

<P><PB N="26" REF="16">It must be granted, that the Reasons of such a grateful Retri|bution are redoubled now: Intermarriages betwixt the two Na|tions are more frequent than ever; the Union of the Kingdoms under one Crown for almost 100 years; the generous Concurrence of the <HI>Scots</HI> in the last Revolution; their loss of so many gallant Officers and brave Soldiers in the common Cause during the late War, and the preservation of <HI>Ireland,</HI> which hath been twice ow|ing to ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> Countreymen, might reasonably entitle us to the same Priviledges now, that our Ancestors were formerly allow'd by K. <HI>Edward,</HI> and <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror. <HI>We need not insist on another sort of Obligati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">n, that we have put upon</HI> England, <HI>twice within this 60 years,</HI> viz: <HI>the delivering them from their Oppressions in the time of</HI> K.

<P><PB N="28" REF="17">Then as to <HI>England,</HI> we were under no manner of obligation to continue the Union with them; <HI>We might have insisted upon having our King obliged to reside as much amongst us, as amongst them: that we should be govern'd without any Consideration or respect to their Interest, any further than it fell in with our own.</HI> We might have insisted upon an Act, that we should not be oblig'd to at|tend his Majesty at any time at the Court of <HI>England,</HI> about our Affairs; but that he should either attend upon our Administra|tion in person <HI>pro re nata,</HI> as he does now upon the Affairs of <HI>Holland,</HI> or lay down Methods to have his Pleasure signified to us at Home in such cases as it was requir'd; which would save a vast deal of Money annually to the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland.</HI> Then as to the Succession, we were under no Necessity of settling it in the same manner as they did in <HI>England;</HI> for since they had made a Breach in the Line, they could not handsomely have blam'd us to have made an improvement of it, and either to have limited the Reversion after his present Majesty's Death, or otherwise as we should have thought best, for the Security of our Civil and Religious Liberties; or we might have settled it upon the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and his Issue by any other Wife, there be|ing cause enough then to conceive that he was never like to have any by his late excellent Princess.

It's reasonable to believe, that the <HI>English</HI> will be so wise as to forbear Hostilities, tho we are very well satisfied, there is a Party in that Nation, who bear ours no Good-will; but they being such as are either disaffected to the present Constitution, or acted by a sordid principle of private Interest, it's to be hop'd they will never be able so far to leaven the sound part of the <HI>English</HI> Nation, as to occasion a Rupture betwixt them and us, Yet we must needs say, that we look upon their way of treating us to be a very unaccountable thing, and that it was no small surprise to us, to find that an <HI>English</HI> Parliament should look on our taking Subscriptions in <HI>England,</HI> in order to admit them Joint-Sharers with our selves, in the benefit of the Act to encour|age our Trade, to be no less than a high Misdemeanour. We have reason likewiwe to complain of their constant practice of pressing our Sea-men in time of War, as if they were their own Subjects, and that they should treat us in other respects, as if we were Aliens; and sometimes confiscate Ships, by reckoning <HI>Scots</HI> Mariners as such: So that the <HI>English</HI> have not only depriv'd us of our Government, and the warm influences of our Court, the want o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> which is a considerable addition to the Natural cold|ness of our Climate, but they likewise oppress us on all occasions,

and do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> endeavour to prevent our Application to Trade. We know there's a Party in that Nation, who think we sustain'd no great loss by the removal of our Princes; but we would wish them to consider what a murmuring they themselves make when the King goes annually to the <HI>Netherlands</HI> (tho the safety of <HI>Eu|rope</HI> requires it) because of the damp it puts upon Trade, and the Money it carries out of the Kingdom. Let them consider then what our Nation hath suffered in that respect now for almost 100 years, besides the lessening our Esteem in the eyes of the World, so that our Honour and Substance are both swallow'd up by the Kingdom of <HI>England;</HI> and yet they will neither admit us to the privileges of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ellow-Subjects with themselves, nor suffer us to take such measures as may enable us to stand on our own bot|tom. Certainly this is not the way to establish the Peace, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> to increase the Wealth of the Island.</P>
<P>We know that it was a Maxime in some of the late Reigns. That it would never be well, till all that part of <HI>Scotland</HI> on this side <HI>Forth,</HI> were reduc'd to a hunting Field: but we were in hopes the bitterness of those days had been past: yet it seems that Party have still so far the ascendant amongst our Neighbours, as to procure a publick Opposition to all our Endeavours for raising our Nation by Trade.</P>
<P>It will upon due Examination be found as bad policy as it is Christianity, to urge, as some of our Neighbours do, that it is the Interest of <HI>England</HI> to keep the <HI>Scots</HI> low, because they are an independent and free Nation&punc; and were our ancient Enemies; and therefore may be dangerous Neighbours if they grow rich and potent. Nothing but Rancor and inveterate Malice can suggest such sour thoughts as these. It were fit that sort of Men should be purg'd of their Choler.

<P>This we think sufficient to convince those angry G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ntlemen in our neighbouring Nation, that are so very much disgusted with our <HI>American</HI> Settlement, that it is the Interest of <HI>England</HI> to join with us and support it, and that it may be of dangerous Conse|quence to them? either to oppose or neglect us: Whereas by joining cordially in this Matter, they may unite us inseparably to themselves for ever, inrich their own Nation, secure and ad|vance the Protestant Interest, keep the Ballance of <HI>Europe</HI> in their Hands, <HI>and prevent the returns of its danger,</HI> their own Expence of Blood and Treasure to save its being threatned with Slavery any more, either by the House of <HI>Bourbon</HI> or <HI>Austria.

<P>WE Come in the next place to give a Description of the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>Darien.</HI> It lies betwixt the <HI>8th</HI> and the <HI>10th</HI> Degrees of <HI>Northern Latitude&punc;</HI> and in the Narrowest place is betwixt 60 and 80 <HI>Italian</HI> Miles over. We shall not trouble our selves with the Description of any more of it than is in the Possession of the Natives, which is in length from E. to W. on the North side from the Mouth of the River <HI>Darien</HI> to Port <HI>Scrivan,</HI> above 140 <HI>Italian</HI> Miles; From <HI>Caret</HI> Bay to the River of <HI>Cheapo</HI> on the South side&punc; it is about 160 in length. It is sup|posed to take its Name from the great River of <HI>Darien,</HI> that bounds its <HI>Northern Coast</HI> to the Eastward. It is bounded on the North and South with the vast Oceans that carry the Names of

<HI>Santa Maria, Panama,</HI> &amp;c. and formerly had a Commission under them as a Captain, upon which he values himself above others. The <HI>French</HI> hate him Mortally, because of something he did a|gainst some of their Nation formerly. When he came on board us, he had a sort of a Coat of red loose Stuff, an old Hat, a pair Drawers, but no Stockings nor Shoes; and the rest that came with him were all naked, excepting their <HI>Penis,</HI> which was co|vered by Extinguishers, as formerly mention'd.</P>
<P><HI>Upon further communing, Capt.</HI> Andreas <HI>was very well pleas'd with us, offered us what part of the Country we would chuse, and accepted a Commission from us; and at the same time we gave him a Basket hilt|ted Sword, and a pair of Pis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ols: upon which he promised to defend us to the last of his Blood.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Some of the Princes on this side the</HI> Isthmus <HI>had been in Peace with the</HI> Spaniards <HI>for several years, and suffered a few of them to reside a|mongst them, to give notice to</HI> Panama <HI>of what Ships came upon these Coasts; but upon some fresh disgust, about two months before we arriv'd, Capt.</HI> Ambrosio, <HI>who is the most noted Prince among'st 'em, had o|blig'd them to enter into a common Alliance against</HI> Spain, <HI>and cut off ten</HI> Spaniards, <HI>who liv'd upon</HI> Golden-Island.</P>
<P>The Place where we are setled is 4 Miles East of <HI>Golden-Island,</HI> within a great Bay. We have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> excellent Harbour, surrounded with high Mountains, capable of holding a Thousand Sail Land|lock'd, and safe from all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> and Tempests. The Mouth of the Harbour is about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> Cannon-shot over, form'd by a <HI>Pe|ninsula</HI> on the one side, and a point of Land on the other. In the middle of the Entrance there is a Rock three foot above water, upon which the Sea breaks most terribly when the Wind blows hard; and within the Points there is a small Rock that lies a little under water. On both sides these Rocks there's a very good wide Channel for Ships to come in: That on the South-side is three Cables lon, and seven Fathom depth; and that on the North two Cables long. From the two outermost points the Harbour runs
<PB N="54" REF="30">
away East a Mile and an half; and near the midle, on the Right hand, a point of Land shoots out into the Bay: so that by rais|ing Forts on the said Point, on the Rock in the midle of the En|trance, and the two outermost Points, it will be the Strongest Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">bour, both by Art and Nature, that's in the known World. The Bay within is for the most part 6 Fathom Water, and till you come within a Cable's length of the shoar, three Fathom and an half: So that a Key may be built, to which great Ships may lay their Sides, and Unload. The <HI>Peninsula</HI> lies on the left hand, is a mile and an half in length, very sleep, and high towards the Sea: so that it would be very difficult for any Body to land, till you come to the <HI>Isthmus</HI> where there's a small sandy Bay that little Ships may put into, but is easie to be secu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ed by a Ditch and a Fort. There are several little Rivers of very good Water that fail into the Bay; and it abounds so with excellent Fish&punc; that we can with ease take more than it's possible for us to destroy, having sometimes caught 140 at a Draught: amongst others there be <HI>Tor|toises,</HI> which are excellent Meat, and some of them above 600 Weight.</P>
<P>The <HI>Peninsula</HI> was never inhabited, and is cover'd all over with Trees of various sorts, as stately Ced<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">rs, Brasil-wood, <HI>Lig|num Vitae,</HI> Box-wood, Fustick-wood, Yellow Sanders, Man|shinel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the like sorts, besides others whose Names we know not. grow on the Continent; and we doubt not of finding out the <HI>Nicaragua</HI> Wood: We have found Cabbage trees, the Fruit of which eats like Collyflowers. <HI>The Natives have no Plan|tation wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">in t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">o Miles of u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">.</HI></P>
<P>We have a Watch Tower upon an high Hill adjoining to our Plantation, about a mile South of the Bay, from whence we can see the Ships in the Bay, the Fort we have raised on the Mouth of the Bay, and as far as the Mouth of the River <HI>Darien:</HI> We can see above thirty Miles Southward, and have a fine Prospect of <HI>Golden-Island,</HI> and the Isle of <HI>Pines,</HI> Westward towards <HI>Porto|bello,</HI>
<PB N="55" REF="30">
and Northward towards <HI>Jamaica.</HI> The Hill is about a Mile in height; so that we can see any Ships before they come within some Leagues of the Harbour. We Compute our selves to be about 50 Leagues North of <HI>Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">thagena,</HI> and as muc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> South of <HI>Portobello.</HI> The four <HI>Indian</HI> Kings or Captains on this Coast, visit us frequently in their Canoes: and the N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">tives are very kind to us, and sell us Plantains, Fowls, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">or Toys or old Shift A <HI>French man</HI> who hath married one of the Natives, informs us, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have Silver and Gold Mines on the <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">thmus</HI> which we might make our selves Masters of with a 100 Men; So that if they commit Hostilities upon us, as we hear th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">y threaten to do, it's not unlikely that we may visit them. We found some French Refugee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> in the Country, who are willing to settle under us, and having been several Years in these Parts, and un|derstanding the Language of the Natives, are very useful to us. We have seen some Sand in the Rivers, which looks as if it were mixt with Gold, and in some places the Earth seems to be very much mixt with it: So that it's concluded, there's more Gold-dust here, than in any part of <HI>Guinea.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Indian</HI> Princes or Captains on this Coast, do somewhat resemble our Heads of Clans in <HI>Scotland;</HI> and by their Converse at times with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and other <HI>European</HI> Nations, affect Christian Names.

<P>From the <HI>Samballoes</HI> to the River of <HI>Conception,</HI> the Countrey is commanded by one <HI>Corbet;</HI> who is altogether in the <HI>French</HI> inte|rest, he having contracted a Friendship with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">heir Privateers seven years ago, and done them many good Offices.

<P>Next to <HI>Corbet,</HI> there's another of their Captains call'd <HI>Nicola,</HI> who is said to be a wise, brave and good natur'd Prince, insomuch that the <HI>Indians</HI> had a mind to have s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">t him up instead of <HI>Ambro|sio,</HI> who is of a rugged military temper: But <HI>Ambrosio</HI>'s Authori|ty and Power is so great, that they did not find it practicable. <HI>Ni|cola</HI> is a mortal Enemy to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and can never entertain a good thought of them&punc; since the Governor of <HI>Porto Bello</HI> rob'd him of a curious Fusee that had been presented him by some of the Buccaneers; and being out of Order, he sent it thither to be mend|ed;

<P>Since we came hither, there have been an <HI>English,</HI> a <HI>Dutch,</HI> and a <HI>French</HI> Ship in our Bay.

He left some Men in the Bay, who have since kill'd some <HI>Spani<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">rds,</HI> and came to us for Arms and Ammunition, but we told them we could not grant them any, and that they had done what they could not justify.

<P>The <HI>French</HI> Ship that put in here, was that which was order'd to carry back the Church-plate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to <HI>Carthagena,</HI> did after|wards bulge on a Rock, and was cast away in our Harbour.

The <HI>French</HI> have been very industrious in cultivating their Interest, both with the Natives and <HI>Spaniards</HI> in this part of <HI>America,</HI> and doubt not of having a good share in those Countries after the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Death.</P>
