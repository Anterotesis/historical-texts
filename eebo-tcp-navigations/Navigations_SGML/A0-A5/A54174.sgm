<HEAD>A Letter from <HI>William Penn,</HI> Proprietor and Governour of <HI>PENNSYLVANIA,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Kind Friends;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Kindne&s;s of yours by the Ship <HI>Thomas</HI> and <HI>Anne,</HI> doth much oblige me; for by it I perceive the Intere&s;t you take in my <HI>Health</HI> and <HI>Reputation,</HI> and the <HI>pro&s;perous Begin|nings</HI> of this <HI>Province,</HI> which you are &s;o kind as to think may much depend upon them. In return of which, I have &s;ent you a long Letter, and yet containing as brief an Ac|count of <HI>My &s;elf,</HI> and the <HI>Affairs</HI> of this <HI>Province,</HI> as I have been able to make.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, I take notice of the <HI>News</HI> you &s;ent me, whereby I find &s;ome Per&s;ons have had &s;o little Wit, and &s;o much Malice, as to report my <HI>Death,</HI> and to mend the matter, <HI>dead a Je&s;uit too.</HI> One might have rea&s;onably hop'd, that this <HI>Di&s;tance,</HI> like <HI>Death,</HI> would have been a protection again&s;t <HI>Spite</HI> and <HI>Envy;</HI> and indeed, <HI>Ab&s;ence</HI> being a kind of <HI>Death,</HI> ought alike to &s;ecure the <HI>Name</HI> of the <HI>Ab&s;ent</HI> as the <HI>Dead;</HI> becau&s;e they are equally unable as &s;uch to defend them&s;elves: But they that intend <HI>Mi&s;chief,</HI> do not u&s;e to follow <HI>good Rules</HI> to effect it. However, to the great Sorrow and Shame of the <HI>Inventors,</HI> I am &s;till <HI>Alive,</HI> and <HI>No Je&s;uit,</HI> and I thank God, <HI>very well:</HI> And without Inju&s;tice to the Authors of this, I may venture to infer, That they that wilfully and fal&s;ly <HI>Report,</HI> would have been glad it had been <HI>So.</HI> But I perceive, many <HI>Idle Stories</HI> have been <HI>Invented</HI> &s;ince my Departure from <HI>England,</HI> which perhaps at this time are no more <HI>Alive,</HI> than I am <HI>Dead.</HI></P>
<P>But if I have been <HI>&V;nkindly</HI> u&s;ed by &s;ome I left behind me, I found <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Re&s;pect</HI> enough where I came; an univer&s;al kind <HI>Welcome,</HI> every &s;ort in their way. For here are &s;ome of &s;e|veral <HI>Nations,</HI> as well as divers <HI>Judgments:</HI> Nor were the <HI>Natives</HI> wanting in this, for their <HI>Kings, Queens</HI> and <HI>Great Men</HI> both vi&s;ited and pre&s;ented me; to whom I made &s;uitable Returns, &amp;c.</P>
<P>For the <HI>PROVINCE,</HI> the general Condition of it take as followeth.</P>
<P N="1">I. The Country it &s;elf in its <HI>Soyl, Air, Water, Sea&s;ons</HI> and <HI>Produce</HI> both Natural and Artifi|cial is not to be de&s;pi&s;ed. The <HI>Land</HI> containeth divers &s;orts of <HI>Earth,</HI> as <HI>Sand</HI> Yellow and Black, Poor and Rich: al&s;o <HI>Gravel</HI> both Loomy and Du&s;ty; and in &s;ome places a <HI>fa&s;t fat Earth,</HI> like to our be&s;t <HI>Vales</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> e&s;pecially by <HI>Inland-Brooks</HI> and <HI>Rivers,</HI> God in his Wi&s;dom having ordered it &s;o, that the <HI>Advantages</HI> of the <HI>Country</HI> are divided, the <HI>Back-Lands</HI> being generally <HI>three</HI> to <HI>one Richer</HI> than tho&s;e that lie by <HI>Navigable Waters.</HI> We have much of another <HI>Soyl,</HI> and that is a <HI>black Ha&s;el-Mould,</HI> upon a <HI>Stony</HI> or <HI>Rocky</HI> bottom.</P>
<P N="2">II. The <HI>Air</HI> is &s;weet and clear, the Heavens &s;erene, like the <HI>South-parts</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> rarely <HI>Overca&s;t;</HI> and as the <HI>Woods</HI> come by numbers of People to be more <HI>clear'd,</HI> that it &s;elf will Refine.</P>
<P N="3">III. The <HI>Waters</HI> are generally good, for the <HI>Rivers</HI> and <HI>Brooks</HI> have mo&s;tly <HI>Gravel</HI> and <HI>Stony Bottoms,</HI> and in Number hardly credible. We have al&s;o <HI>Mineral Waters,</HI> that operate in the &s;ame manner with <HI>Barnet</HI> and <HI>North-hall,</HI> not two Miles from <HI>Philadelphia.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. For the <HI>Sea&s;ons</HI> of the Year, having by God's goodne&s;s now lived over the <HI>Colde&s;t</HI> and <HI>Hotte&s;t,</HI> that the <HI>Olde&s;t Liver</HI> in the <HI>Province</HI> can remember, I can &s;ay &s;omething to an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t, Of the <HI>Fall,</HI> for then I came in: I found it from the 24th of <HI>October,</HI> to the beginning of <HI>December,</HI> as we have it u&s;ually in <HI>England</HI> in <HI>September,</HI> or rather like an <HI>Engli&s;h mild Spring.</HI> From <HI>December</HI> to the beginning of the Moneth called <HI>March,</HI> we had <HI>&s;harp Fro&s;ty Weather,</HI> not foul, thick, black Weather, as our <HI>North-Ea&s;t Winds</HI> bring with them in <HI>England;</HI> but a Skie as clear as in <HI>Summer,</HI> and the Air dry, cold, piercing and hungry; yet I remember not, that I wore more <HI>Clothes</HI> than in <HI>England.</HI> The rea&s;on of this <HI>Cold</HI> is given from the great <HI>Lakes</HI> that are fed by the <HI>Fountains</HI> of <HI>Canada.</HI> The <HI>Winter</HI> before was as <HI>mild,</HI> &s;carce any <HI>Ice</HI> at all; while this for a <HI>few dayes Froze</HI> up our great River <HI>Delaware.</HI> From that Moneth to the Moneth called <HI>June,</HI> we enjoy'd a <HI>&s;weet Spring,</HI> no <HI>Gu&s;ts,</HI> but <HI>gentle Showers,</HI> and a fine Skie. Yet this I ob&s;erve, that the <HI>Winds</HI> here as there, are more Incon&s;tant <HI>Spring</HI> and <HI>Fall,</HI> upon that turn of Nature, than in <HI>Summer</HI> or <HI>Winter.</HI> From thence to this pre&s;ent, Moneth, which endeth the <HI>Summer</HI> (commonly &s;peaking) we have had <HI>extraordinary Heats</HI> yet mitigated &s;ometimes by <HI>Cool Br<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ezese.</HI> The <HI>Wind</HI> that ruleth the <HI>Summer-&s;ea&s;on,</HI> is the
<PB N="4" REF="3"><HI>South-We&s;t;</HI> but <HI>Spring, Fall</HI> and <HI>Winter,</HI> 'tis rare to want the <HI>whole&s;ome North We&s;ter</HI> &s;even dayes together: And what-ever <HI>Mi&s;ts, Fogs</HI> or <HI>Vapours</HI> foul the Heavens by <HI>Ea&s;terly</HI> or <HI>Southerly Winds,</HI> in two Hours time are blown away; the <HI>one</HI> is alwayes followed by the <HI>other:</HI> A Re|medy that &s;eems to have a peculiar Providence in it to the Inhabitants; the multitude of <HI>Trees,</HI> yet &s;tanding, being liable to retain <HI>Mi&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Vapours,</HI> and yet not one quarter &s;o <HI>thick</HI> as I expected.</P>
<P N="5">V. The <HI>Natural Produce</HI> of the Country, of <HI>Vegetables,</HI> is <HI>Trees, Fruits, Plants, Flowers.</HI> The <HI>Trees</HI> of mo&s;t note are, the <HI>black Walnut, Cedar, Cyprus, Che&s;tnut, Poplar, Gumwood, Hic|kery, Sa&s;&s;afrax, A&s;h, Beech</HI> and <HI>Oak</HI> of divers &s;orts, as <HI>Red, White</HI> and <HI>Black; Spani&s;h Che&s;tnut</HI> and <HI>Swamp,</HI> the mo&s;t durable of all: of <HI>All</HI> which there is plenty for the u&s;e of man.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fruits</HI> that I find in the <HI>Woods,</HI> are the <HI>White</HI> and <HI>Black Mulbery, Che&s;tnut, Wallnut, Plumbs, Strawberries, Cranberries, Hurtleberries</HI> and <HI>Grapes</HI> of divers &s;orts. The great <HI>Red Grape</HI> (now ripe) called by Ignorance, the <HI>Fox-Grape</HI> (becau&s;e of the Reli&s;h it hath with unskilful Palates) is in it &s;elf an extraordinary <HI>Grape,</HI> and by Art doubtle&s;s may be Cultivated to an excellent <HI>Wine,</HI> if not &s;o &s;weet, yet little inferior to the <HI>Frontiniack,</HI> as it is not much unlike in ta&s;te, Ruddine&s;s &s;et a&s;ide, which in &s;uch things, as well as Mankind, differs the ca&s;e much. There is a <HI>white</HI> kind of <HI>Muskedel,</HI> and a little <HI>black Grape,</HI> like the Clu&s;ter-Grape of <HI>England,</HI> not yet &s;o ripe as the other; but they tell me, when Ripe, &s;weeter, and that they only want skilful <HI>Vinerons</HI> to make good u&s;e of them: I intend to venture on it with my <HI>French-man</HI> this &s;ea&s;on, who &s;hews &s;ome knowledge in tho&s;e things. Here are al&s;o <HI>Peaches,</HI> and very good, and in great quantities, not an <HI>Indian Plantation</HI> without them; but whether naturally here at fir&s;t, I know not, however one may have them by <HI>Bu&s;hels</HI> for little; they make a plea&s;ant <HI>Drink</HI> and I think not inferior to any <HI>Peach</HI> you have in <HI>England,</HI> except the true <HI>Newington.</HI> 'Tis di&s;pu|table with me, whether it be be&s;t to fall to <HI>Fining</HI> the Fruits of the Country, e&s;pecially the <HI>Grape,</HI> by the care and skill of Art, or &s;end for <HI>forreign Stems</HI> and <HI>Sets,</HI> already good and approved: It &s;eems mo&s;t rea&s;onable to believe, that not only a thing groweth be&s;t, where it naturally grows; but will hardly be equalled by another <HI>Species</HI> of the &s;ame kind, that doth not naturally grow there. But to <HI>&s;olve</HI> the doubt, I intend, if God give me Life, to try <HI>both,</HI> and hope the con&s;equence will be as <HI>good Wine</HI> as any <HI>European</HI> Countries of the &s;ame Latitude do yield.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The <HI>Artificial Produce</HI> of the Country, is <HI>Wheat, Barley, Oats, Rye, Pea&s;e, Beans, Squa&s;hes, Pumkins,</HI>
<NOTE>Note, that <HI>Edward Jones,</HI> Son|in-Law to <HI>Thomas Wynn,</HI> living on the <HI>Schulkil,</HI> had with ordinary Cul|tivation, for one <HI>one Grain</HI> of <HI>Engli&s;h Barley, &s;eventy Stalks</HI> and <HI>Ears</HI> of <HI>Barley;</HI> And 'tis common in this Country from <HI>one Bu&s;hel</HI> &s;own, to reap <HI>forty,</HI> often <HI>fifty,</HI> and &s;ometimes <HI>&s;ixty.</HI> And three <HI>Pecks</HI> of <HI>Wheat</HI> &s;ows an <HI>Acre</HI> here.</NOTE> <HI>Water-Melons, Mu&s;-Melons,</HI> and all Herbs and Roots that our Gardens in <HI>England</HI> u&s;ually bring forth.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Of living Creatures; <HI>Fi&s;h, Fowl,</HI> and the Bea&s;ts of the Woods, here are divers &s;orts, &s;ome for Food and Profit, and &s;ome for Profit only: For Food as well as Profit, the <HI>Elk,</HI> as big as a &s;mall <HI>Ox, Deer</HI> bigger than ours, <HI>Beaver, Racoon, Rab|bits, Squirrels,</HI> and &s;ome eat young <HI>Bear,</HI> and commend it. Of <HI>Fowl</HI> of the Land, there is the <HI>Turkey</HI> (Forty and Fifty Pound weight) which is very great; <HI>Phe&s;ants, Heath-Birds, Pidgeons</HI> and <HI>Partridges</HI> in abundance. Of the Water, the <HI>Swan, Goo&s;e,</HI> white and gray, <HI>Brands, Ducks, Teal,</HI> al&s;o the <HI>Snipe</HI> and <HI>Curloe,</HI> and that in great Numbers; but the <HI>Duck</HI> and <HI>Teal</HI> excel, nor &s;o good have I ever eat in other Countries. Of <HI>Fi&s;h,</HI> there is the <HI>Sturgeon, Herring, Rock, Shad, Cat&s;head, Sheep&s;head, Ele, Smelt, Pearch, Roach;</HI> and in Inland Rivers, <HI>Trout,</HI> &s;ome &s;ay <HI>Salmon,</HI> above the Falls. Of <HI>Shel|fi&s;h,</HI> we have <HI>Oy&s;ters, Crabbs, Cockles, Concks</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;hels;</HI> &s;ome <HI>Oy&s;ters &s;ix Inches</HI> long, and one &s;ort of <HI>Cockles</HI> as big as the Stewing <HI>Oy&s;ters,</HI> they make a rich Broth. The Creatures for Profit only by <HI>Skin</HI> or <HI>Fur,</HI> and that are natural to the&s;e parts, are the <HI>Wild Cat, Panther, Otter, Wolf, Fox, Fi&s;her, Minx, Musk-Rat;</HI> and of the Water, the <HI>Whale</HI> for <HI>Oyl,</HI> of which we have good &s;tore, and two Companies of <HI>Whalers,</HI> who&s;e Boats are built, will &s;oon begin their Work, which hath the appearance of a con&s;iderable Improvement. To &s;ay nothing of our rea|&s;onable Hopes of good <HI>Cod</HI> in the <HI>Bay.</HI></P>
<P N="8">VIII. We have no want of <HI>Hor&s;es,</HI> and &s;ome are very good and &s;hapely enough; two Ships have been freighted to <HI>Barbadoes</HI> with <HI>Hor&s;es</HI> and <HI>Pipe-Staves,</HI> &s;ince my coming in. Here is al&s;o Plenty of <HI>Cow-Cattle,</HI> and &s;ome <HI>Sheep;</HI> the People <HI>Plow</HI> mo&s;tly with <HI>Oxen.</HI></P>
<P N="9">IX. There are divers <HI>Plants</HI> that not only the <HI>Indians</HI> tell us, but we have had occa&s;ion to prove by <HI>Swellings, Burnings, Cuts,</HI> &amp;c. that they are of great Virtue, &s;uddenly curing the Pa|tient: and for <HI>&s;mell,</HI> I have ob&s;erved &s;everal, e&s;pecially one, the <HI>wild Mirtle;</HI> the other I know not what to call, but are mo&s;t <HI>fragrant.</HI></P>
<P N="10">X. The <HI>Woods</HI> are adorned with lovely <HI>Flowers,</HI> for <HI>colour, greatne&s;s, figure</HI> and <HI>variety:</HI> I have &s;een the <HI>Gardens</HI> of <HI>London</HI> be&s;t &s;tored with that &s;ort of Beauty, but think they may be im|proved by our <HI>Woods:</HI> I have &s;ent a few to a Per&s;on of Quality this Year for a tryal.</P>
<P>Thus much of the <HI>Country,</HI> next of the <HI>Natives</HI> or <HI>Aborigines.</HI></P>
<P N="11"><PB N="5" REF="3"> XI. The <HI>NATIVES</HI> I shall con&s;ider in their <HI>Per&s;ons, Language, Manners, Religion</HI> and <HI>Government,</HI> with my &s;ence of their <HI>Original.</HI> For their <HI>Per&s;ons,</HI> they are generally tall, &s;treight, well-built, and of &s;ingular Proportion; they tread &s;trong and clever, and mo&s;tly walk with a lofty Chin: Of Complexion, <HI>Black,</HI> but by de&s;ign, as the <HI>Gyp&s;ies</HI> in <HI>England:</HI> They grea&s;e them&s;elves with Bears-&s;at clarified, and u&s;ing no defence again&s;t <HI>Sun</HI> or <HI>Weather,</HI> their skins mu&s;t needs be &s;warthy: Their <HI>Eye</HI> is little and black, not unlike a &s;traight-look't <HI>Jew:</HI> The <HI>thick Lip</HI> and <HI>flat No&s;e,</HI> &s;o frequent with the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indians</HI> and <HI>Blacks,</HI> are not common to them; for I have &s;een as comely <HI>European-like faces</HI> among them of both, as on your &s;ide the Sea; and truly an <HI>Italian Complexion</HI> hath not much more of the <HI>White,</HI> and the <HI>No&s;es</HI> of &s;everal of them have as much of the <HI>Roman.</HI></P>
<P N="12">XII. Their <HI>Language</HI> is lofty, yet narrow, but like the <HI>Hebrew;</HI> in Signification full, like <HI>Short-hand</HI> in writing; <HI>one</HI> word &s;erveth in the place of <HI>three,</HI> and the re&s;t are &s;upplied by the Under&s;tanding of the Hearer: Imperfect in their <HI>Ten&s;es,</HI> wanting in their <HI>Moods, Participles, Adverbs, Conjunctions, Interjections:</HI> I have made it my bu&s;ine&s;s to under&s;tand it, that I might not want an Interpreter on any occa&s;ion: And I mu&s;t &s;ay, that I know not a Language &s;poken in <HI>Europe,</HI> that hath words of more &s;weetne&s;s or greatne&s;s, in <HI>Accent</HI> and <HI>Empha&s;is,</HI> than theirs; for In&s;tance, <HI>Octorockon, Rancocas, Oricton, Shakamaron, Poque&s;&s;in,</HI> all which are names of Places, and have Grandeur in them: Of words of Sweetne&s;s, <HI>Anna,</HI> is <HI>Mother, <HI>I&s;|&s;imus,</HI> a Brother, <HI>Qetap,</HI> Friend, <HI>u&s;que oret,</HI> very good; <HI>pone,</HI> Bread, <HI>met&s;e,</HI> eat, <HI>matta,</HI> no, <HI>hatta,</HI> to have, <HI>payo,</HI> to come; <HI>Sepa&s;&s;en, Pa&s;&s;ion,</HI></HI> the Names of Places; <HI>Tamane, Secane, Menan&s;e, Secatereus,</HI> are the Names of Per&s;ons. If one ask them for any thing they have not, they will an&s;wer, <HI>matt&aacute; ne hatt&aacute;,</HI> which to tran&s;late is, <HI>not I have,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>I have not.</HI></P>
<P N="13">XIII. Of their <HI>Cu&s;toms</HI> and <HI>Manners</HI> there is much to be &s;aid; I will begin with <HI>Children.</HI> So &s;oon as they are born, they wa&s;h them in <HI>Water,</HI> and while very young, and in cold Weather to chu&s;e, they <HI>Plunge</HI> them in the Rivers to harden and embolden them. Having wrapt them in a Clout, they lay them on a &s;traight thin Board, a little more than the length and breadth of the Child, and &s;wadle it fa&s;t upon the Board to make it &s;traight; wherefore all <HI>Indians</HI> have flat Heads; and thus they carry them at their Backs. The Children will go very <HI>young,</HI> at <HI>nine Moneths</HI> commonly; they wear only a &s;mall Clout round their Wa&s;te, till they are big; if <HI>Boys,</HI> they go a Fi&s;hing till ripe for the Woods, which is about <HI>Fifteen;</HI> then they Hunt, and after having given &s;ome Proofs of their Manhood, by a good return of <HI>Skins,</HI> they may <HI>Marry,</HI> el&s;e it is a shame to think of a <HI>Wife.</HI> The <HI>Girls</HI> &s;tay with their Mothers, and help to hoe the Ground, plant Corn and carry Burthens; and they do well to u&s;e them to that <HI>Young,</HI> they mu&s;t do when they are <HI>Old;</HI> for the <HI>Wives</HI> are the true <HI>Servants</HI> of their <HI>Husbands:</HI> otherwi&s;e the Men are very affectionate to them.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. When the <HI>Young Women</HI> are fit for <HI>Marriage,</HI> they wear &s;omething upon their Heads for an Adverti&s;ement, but &s;o as their Faces are hardly to be &s;een, but when they plea&s;e: The <HI>Age</HI> they <HI>Marry</HI> at, if <HI>Women,</HI> is about <HI>thirteen</HI> and <HI>fourteen;</HI> if <HI>Men, &s;eventeen</HI> and <HI>eighteen;</HI> they are rarely elder.</P>
<P N="15">XV. Their <HI>Hou&s;es</HI> are <HI>Mats,</HI> or <HI>Barks of Trees</HI> &s;et on Poles, in the fa&s;hion of an <HI>Engli&s;h Barn,</HI> but out of the power of the Winds, for they are hardly higher than a Man; they lie on <HI>Reeds</HI> or <HI>Gra&s;s.</HI> In <HI>Travel</HI> they lodge in the <HI>Woods</HI> about a great Fire, with the Mantle of <HI>Duffills</HI> they wear by day, wrapt about them, and a few Boughs &s;tuck round them.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. Their <HI>Diet</HI> is <HI>Maze,</HI> or <HI>Indian Corn,</HI> divers ways prepared; &s;ometimes <HI>Roa&s;ted</HI> in the A&s;hes, &s;ometimes beaten and <HI>Boyled</HI> with Water, which they call <HI>Homine;</HI> they al&s;o make <HI>Cakes,</HI> not unplea&s;ant to eat: They have likewi&s;e &s;everal &s;orts of <HI>Beans</HI> and <HI>Pea&s;e</HI> that are good Nouri&s;hment; and the <HI>Woods</HI> and <HI>Rivers</HI> are their <HI>Larder.</HI></P>
<P N="17">XVII. If an <HI>European</HI> comes to &s;ee them, or calls for Lodging at their Hou&s;e or <HI>Wigwam,</HI> they give him the be&s;t place and fir&s;t cut. If they come to vi&s;it us, they &s;alute us with an <HI>Itah,</HI> which is as much as to &s;ay, <HI>Good be to you,</HI> and &s;et them down, which is mo&s;tly on the Ground, clo&s;e to their Heels, their Legs upright; may be they &s;peak not a word more, but ob&s;erve all Pa&s;&s;ages: If you give them any thing to eat or drink, well, for they will not ask; and be it little or much, if it be with Kindne&s;s, they are well plea&s;ed, el&s;e they go away &s;ullen, but &s;ay nothing.</P>

<HEAD>A &s;hort Adverti&s;ement Upon the Scituation and Extent of the CITY of PHILADELPHIA And the en&s;uing <HI>PLAT-FORM</HI> thereof.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By the Surveyor General.</BYLINE>
<P>THe City of <HI>Philadelphia</HI> now extends in <HI>Length,</HI> from River to River, <HI>two Miles,</HI> and in <HI>Breadth</HI> near a <HI>Mile;</HI> and the <HI>Governour,</HI> as a further manife&s;tation of his Kindne&s;s to the <HI>Purcha&s;ers,</HI> hath freely given them their re&s;pective <HI>Lots</HI> in the City, without defalcation of any their <HI>Quantities</HI> of <HI>purcha&s;ed Lands;</HI> and as its now placed and modelled between <HI>two Navigable Rivers</HI> upon a Neck of Land, and that Ships may ride in good <HI>Anchorage,</HI> in <HI>&s;ix</HI> or <HI>eight Fathom Water</HI> in both Rivers, clo&s;e to the City, and the Land of the City level, dry and whol&s;om; &s;uch a <HI>Scituation</HI> is &s;carce to be parallel'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Model</HI> of the <HI>City</HI> appears by a &s;mall <HI>Draught</HI> now made, and may hereafter, when time permits, be augmented; and becau&s;e there is not room to expre&s;s the <HI>Purcha&s;ers Names</HI> in the <HI>Draught,</HI> I have therefore drawn <HI>Directions</HI> of <HI>Reference,</HI> by way of <HI>Numbers,</HI> whereby may be known each mans <HI>Lot</HI> and <HI>Place</HI> in the <HI>City.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>City</HI> is &s;o ordered now, by the <HI>Governour's Care</HI> and <HI>Prudence,</HI> that it hath a <HI>Front</HI> to each <HI>River,</HI> one half at <HI>Delaware,</HI> the other at <HI>Skulkill;</HI> and though all this cannot make way for <HI>&s;mall Purcha&s;ers</HI> to be in the <HI>Fronts,</HI> yet they are placed in the <HI>next Streets,</HI> contiguous to each <HI>Front, viz.</HI> all Purcha&s;ers of <HI>one Thou&s;and Acres,</HI> and upwards, have the <HI>Fronts</HI> (and the <HI>High-&s;treet</HI>) and to every <HI>five Thou&s;and Acres Purcha&s;e,</HI> in the <HI>Front</HI> about an <HI>Acre,</HI> and the <HI>&s;maller Purcha&s;ers</HI> about <HI>half an Acre</HI> in the <HI>backward Street;</HI> by which means the lea&s;t hath room enough for <HI>Hou&s;e, Garden</HI> and <HI>&s;mall Orchard,</HI> to the great Content and Satisfaction of all here concerned.</P>
<P>The <HI>City</HI> (as the <HI>Model</HI> &s;hews) con&s;i&s;ts of a <HI>large Front-&s;treet</HI> to each River, and a <HI>High-&s;treet</HI> (near the middle) from <HI>Front</HI> (or River) to <HI>Front,</HI> of <HI>one hundred foot broad,</HI> and <HI>a broad Street</HI> in the middle of the City, from <HI>&s;ide</HI> to <HI>&s;ide,</HI> of the like breadth. In the Center of the City, is a <HI>Square</HI> of <HI>Ten Acres;</HI> at each Angle are to be Hou&s;es for <HI>publick Affairs,</HI> as a <HI>Meeting-Hou&s;e, A&s;&s;embly</HI> or <HI>State-Hou&s;e, Market-Hou&s;e, School-Hou&s;e,</HI> and &s;everal other Buildings for <HI>Publick Concerns.</HI> There are al&s;o in each Quarter of the City, a <HI>Square</HI> of <HI>eight Acres,</HI> to be for the like U&s;es, as the <HI>Moor-fields</HI> in <HI>London;</HI> and <HI>eight Streets</HI> (be&s;ides the &s;aid <HI>High-&s;treet</HI>) that run from <HI>front</HI> to <HI>front,</HI> and <HI>twenty Streets</HI> (be&s;ides the <HI>broad-&s;treet</HI>) that run cro&s;s the City, from <HI>&s;ide</HI> to <HI>&s;ide;</HI> all the&s;e Streets are of <HI>fifty Foot breadth.</HI></P>
<P>In each <HI>Number</HI> in the <HI>Draught,</HI> in the <HI>Fronts</HI> and <HI>High-&s;treet,</HI> are placed the <HI>Purcha&s;ers</HI> of <HI>One Thou&s;and Acres,</HI> and upwards, to make up <HI>five Thou&s;and Acres Lot,</HI> both in the &s;aid <HI>Fronts</HI> and <HI>High-&s;treet,</HI> and the <HI>Numbers</HI> direct to each <HI>Lot,</HI> and where in the City; &s;o that thereby they may know, where their Concerns are therein.</P>
<P>The <HI>Front Lots</HI> begin at the <HI>South-ends</HI> of the <HI>Fronts,</HI> by the <HI>Numbers,</HI> and &s;o reach to the <HI>North-ends,</HI> and end at <HI>Number</HI> 43. The <HI>Hight-&s;treet Lots</HI> begin towards the <HI>Fronts</HI> at <HI>Number</HI> 44. and &s;o reach to the Center.</P>
<P>The <HI>le&s;&s;er Purcha&s;ers</HI> begin at <HI>Number</HI> 1. in the <HI>&s;econd Streets,</HI> and &s;o proceed by the <HI>Numbers,</HI> as in the <HI>Draught;</HI> the <HI>bigge&s;t</HI> of them being <HI>fir&s;t placed,</HI> neare&s;t to the <HI>Fronts.</HI></P>
