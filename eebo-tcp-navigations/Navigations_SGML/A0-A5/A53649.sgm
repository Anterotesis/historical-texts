<P>ON <HI>April</HI> the 11th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ship's departure from <HI>Eng|land.</HI></NOTE> 1689. the Memorable Day, whereon their Maje&s;ties, King <HI>Wil|liam</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary</HI> were Crown'd, did the <HI>Ship Benjamin</HI> break ground from <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> towards her intended Voyage to <HI>Suratt</HI> in the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies.</HI> Whither &s;he was &s;ent as an Advice-Ship of that wonderful Revolution, whereby their Sacred Maje&s;ties were peaceably &s;etled in

the Throne, and had been receiv'd with the Univer&s;al Joy of all the Nation. In all places where we came, we were welcomed with loud and chearful Acclamations, and were entertain'd with unu&s;ual Congratula|tions and Re&s;pect, as happy Me&s;|&s;engers of as grateful News, as ever arrived in tho&s;e Parts. They were every where truly &s;en&s;ible of their unexpected Deliverance from that Mi&s;ery and Thraldom which even there threatned them, and likewi&s;e of the invaluable Ble&s;&s;ing of living under a Peaceable Government, free from their former Apprehen&s;ions, ei|ther of violence upon their Temporal Enjoyments, or di&s;turbance to the Tranquility of their Minds.</P>
<P>We had not long left the Lands-End of <HI>England,</HI> before we e&s;pied a great Fleet of Ships, which appear'd to us at a di&s;tance like a floating Fo|re&s;t, and &s;eiz'd us with no little Con|&s;ternation. Their lying off not far from <HI>Bre&s;t,</HI> made us for &s;ome time conjecture them to be <HI>French,</HI> till we were happily undeceived by the ap|proach of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Frigot, which
<PB N="3" REF="10">
di&s;cover'd them to be Friends. How|ever, one of our Company, who had faithfully ingaged to &s;tand by us, and on who&s;e A&s;&s;i&s;tance we de|pended, without any Ceremony, be|ing apprehen&s;ive of the danger, clapt upon a wind, and &s;o left us.</P>
<P>After this, we kept on our cour&s;e with a favourable Wind, till we arrived at <HI>Madeira,</HI> a &s;mall I&s;land appertaining to the Crown of <HI>Por|tugal,</HI> &s;ituated about the Two and Thirtieth Degree of Latitude; it is in length, about Twenty Five Miles, about Eight or Ten broad, and Sixty in its Circumference.</P>

<HEAD>THE ISLAND OF <HI>MADEIRA.</HI></HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The I&s;land of <HI>Madei|ra.</HI></NOTE>THis I&s;land, as we are inform'd by good Hi&s;torians, was fir&s;t di&s;cover'd by <HI>John Gon&s;alvo</HI> and <HI>Tri|&s;tan,</HI> under the Patronage of <HI>Henry In|fanto</HI> of <HI>Portugal.</HI> But the pre&s;ent Inhabitants give us a different Ac|count of its Di&s;covery, <HI>viz.</HI> That in the Year 1344. an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentleman,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The di&s;co|very of this I&s;land by the <HI>Eng|li&s;h.</HI></NOTE> having Married a Lady of a con&s;ide|rable Fortune, and &s;etting out with her for <HI>France</HI> from the Port of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> was by gu&s;ty weather, and oppo&s;ite winds, driven into this I&s;land: Where, upon his Landing, finding it a forlorn Place, both Uncultivated and Unpeo|pled, he fell into an extream fit of Melancholy, and yielding too much to that black Di&s;temper, contributed by
<PB N="5" REF="11">
his own Death to make it &s;till the more de&s;olate. The Mariners however, who were not &s;o readily dejected at this Mi&s;adventure, &s;et Sail with their Ve&s;&s;el, and landed &s;afely on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Barbary;</HI> where, after &s;ome Re|fre&s;hment and Re&s;pite upon the place, they fortunately fell into the Company of &s;ome Ingenious <HI>Portugue&s;e;</HI> to whom, after a little Conference, they Related the Hard&s;hips of the Voyage, the Situation and Native Plea&s;antne&s;s of the uninhabited, but mo&s;t habitable I&s;land they had left, and the ju&s;t hopes and pro&s;pect they had of regaining a &s;ight of it, were they but provided with Ships and Men. This excited the Attention of the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> and likewi&s;e, without much reluctancy, procur'd their Promi&s;e of endeavour|ing with their Prince to incline him to hearken to the&s;e Propo&s;als, and like|wi&s;e to equip them with Nece&s;&s;aries and Conveniencies for a &s;econd Under|taking: And &s;ucceeding with him ac|cording to their wi&s;hes, they &s;et for|ward, found the I&s;land, landed their Men, and in a &s;hort time converted the Wilderne&s;s into a Garden of Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="12"><NOTE PLACE="marg">The di&s;co|very of this I&s;land by the <HI>Portu|gue&s;e.</HI></NOTE>Some &s;ay <HI>Madeira</HI> was di&s;cover'd by the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> in <HI>Anno</HI> 1429. and de|riv'd its Name from the abundance of Wood that grew there. It was over|&s;pread with Wilderne&s;&s;es and plenty of Trees, (which gave it this Name,) as with one intire Wood; the tedious thoughts of cutting down which, per|&s;waded them to a more &s;peedy Method of de&s;troying it by fire. After it was kindled, the Flames grew to &s;uch a head, raged &s;o violently, and by de|grees became &s;o furious, that the Peo|ple were forc'd for their Ea&s;e and Pre|&s;ervation, to betake them&s;elves to the water, to avoid the violence of the heat.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The rea&s;on of the fruit|fulne&s;s of the I&s;land.</NOTE>The remaining A&s;hes contributed &s;o much to the Fertility of the Ground, that it at fir&s;t produced &s;ixty for one, the fruitful Vines brought forth more Grapes than Leaves, Clu&s;ters of two or three &s;pans length; and in all its Products, their Beauty and Fertility were &s;o remarkable, that it gain'd the Title of the <HI>Queen of I&s;lands.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Its good Air.</NOTE>The Air here, to which the Plea&s;ure as well, as Health of Humane Life is &s;o much owing, is generally very

Temperate and undi&s;turbed, and the Heavens &s;miling and &s;erene. For tho&s;e Climates which are placed be|tween the Thirtieth and Fortieth De|grees of Latitude, enjoy a Tempera|ture, generally very equal and conve|nient, infe&s;ted neither with the ex|ce&s;s of Heat, nor rigid Coldne&s;s, but moderately participating of tho&s;e trou|ble&s;ome Extreams. They &s;eem indi|&s;putably to be mo&s;t &s;uited to the Plea|&s;antne&s;s of Humane Life, and accom|modated to our Con&s;titutions; afford|ing that delight to the Body, which Virtue imparts to the Mind, in avoid|ing all exce&s;&s;es, as dangerous and un|grateful, and oppo&s;ite to the Ea&s;e, as well of the Sen&s;itive, as Intellectual Part.</P>
<P>The principal Town is <HI>Tunchal</HI> or <HI>Tonzal,</HI> &s;ome of them term it <HI>Funchal,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Metro|polis.</NOTE> from the abundance of Fennel which they &s;ay grew there.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Four &s;orts of Grapes that make the Wine.</NOTE>The main product of the I&s;land is Grapes, brought hither fir&s;t from <HI>Candy,</HI> of which there are three or four kinds, whereof they make their Wine. One is coloured like Champaign, of little e&s;teem; another is more &s;trong and pale as White Wine; the third &s;ort is rich and delicious, called Malm&s;ey; the fourth is <HI>Tento,</HI> equalling Tent in colour, but far inferiour in Ta&s;te; it is never drunk unle&s;s in other Wines, with which it is mixt to give them a Tincture, and to pre&s;erve them. And
<PB N="9" REF="13">
for fermenting and feeding them, they brui&s;e and bake a certain Stone, called Je&s;s, of which nine or ten pounds are thrown into each Pipe.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;ingu|lar Virtue of the <HI>Ma|deira</HI> Wine.</NOTE> The <HI>Ma|deira</HI> Wine has in it this peculiar Ex|cellence, of being meliorated by the heat of the Sun when it is prick'd, if the Bunghole being open'd 'tis ex|pos'd to the Air.</P>
<P>The Product of the Vine is equally divided between the Proprietor and him that gathers and pre&s;&s;es the Grapes; and yet for the mo&s;t part the Merchant is Thriving and Rich, whil&s;t the Grape-gatherer, imploy'd by him, is but Poor.

<P>After this we &s;tood off from Shore, fill'd our Sails, and without any Cere|monious Adieu, either to the Governour or the Fort, we left the I&s;land.

are train'd to it after this manner. Whenever the Hawk they breed up to it is hungry, they fix its meat upon the No&s;e of a Counterfeit Antilope, and from thence only feed it, without allowing it any Meat but what it Eats there. After this they carry one or two of the&s;e Falcons into the Fields, and flying one of them at an Antilope, it fa&s;tens ju&s;t upon his No&s;e, which &s;o blinds and &s;tops the Antilope, by the force and fluttering of its Wings, that he can neither well e&s;py his way, nor find his Feet as nimbly as he would; and this gives a very ea&s;ie admittance to the Men or Dogs to come in and catch him. If this Hawk is beaten off, which is &s;ometimes done with much a|do, another aloft &s;toops and lights up|on the &s;ame place, and &s;trikes him backwards with his Talons, 'till at length he is made a Prey: For one of the Hawks always mounts as the o|ther &s;toops.</P>

Upon each &s;ide of the Back-bone of the Men are &s;tuck two Iron Hooks into the Fle&s;h, by which they are lifted up to the top of a Pole &s;tanding out like a Gibbet, above 20 Foot high. This Gibbet is fa&s;ten'd to an Engine with four Wheels, which is drawn upon the Ground above a Mile, with the Men hanging upon the Ten|ters all the way. The Women have each of them a &s;ort of Ba&s;on upon their Heads, upon which are &s;et Six Cups as large as Tea-Cups, one upon another, with Fire in each of them, which being very tottering, makes the Women ex|ceding careful how they tread; le&s;t if they &s;lip, and thereby any Cup falls, or the Fire be &s;haken out of any, the Woman forfeits her Life, and is &s;en|tenc'd to immediate Death.

<PB N="377" REF="201">
the nearer the Dog is brought to the dead Body, the nearer are its approach|es to Felicity. And if the hungry Cur can by bits of Cake be brought &s;o nigh the Decea&s;ed, as to come up to him, and take a piece cut of his Mouth, 'tis then an unque&s;tionable Sign, that the Condition he died in was very hap|py; but if the timorous Dog &s;tartles at the &s;ight, or loaths the Object, or being lately well fed, has no Stomach to that ordinary Mor&s;el, which he mu&s;t &s;natch out of the dead Man's Jaws, the Ca&s;e then with him is de&s;perate, and his &s;tate deplorable.

All the while they were thus gabling, a piece of White Paper fa&s;ten'd to each Ear, o'rethwart the Face, hung down two or three Inches below the Chin; and as &s;oon as they had ended their Petitions, the <HI>Halalchors</HI> took up the Corps, and conveyed it to the Re|po&s;itory, which was near; all the Com|pany ranking them&s;elves by two and two, and following it with joined Hands. The place of Sepulture is in the open Fields, within a Wall built in form of a Circle, about twelve Foot high, and about an hundred in the Cir|cumference; in the middle of which was a Door of Stone about &s;ix foot from the ground, which was open'd to ad|mit the Corps. The Ground within the Walls is rais'd above four Foot, and made &s;helving towards the Corner, that the Filth and Moi&s;ture which are drain'd continually from the Car|ca&s;&s;es, may by an ea&s;ie pa&s;&s;age de&s;cend into a Sink made in the middle to re|ceive them.

<P>Having &s;poke thus much of <HI>Arabia</HI> in general, of the Extent and Situa|tion of <HI>Mu&s;catt,</HI> and the quality of its Climate, of the Stature and Comple|xion of the Inhabitants, and nature of the Soil thereabouts; I will now relate one thing ob&s;ervable concerning the Food of their Cattle, and will then pro|ceed to an Account of the Temperance and Ju&s;tice of the <HI>Arabians</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;catt,</HI> for which two things they are more re|markable than any other Nation this day in the World.</P>
<P>Their Cattle here are fed with Fi&s;h,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fi&s;h the Food of their Cat|tle.</NOTE> which is a &s;ort of Food that &s;eems as Unnatural for them as for Fi&s;h to live
<PB N="426" REF="226">

But the Fi&s;h which they eat is not fre&s;h, and ju&s;t taken out of the Sea, but when a great quantity of it is caught, the <HI>Mu&s;catrers</HI> dig a large Hole in the Ground wherein they put it, 'till it remains &s;o long that it rotts and comes to a kind of Earth. After this it is taken up, and boil'd with Water in great Earthen Pots, which makes a kind of thick Broth; and &s;tand|ing 'till it is cool, it is then given to the Cattle, by which they grow extreme Fat, and yet their Fle&s;h is very &s;avory, not tainted with either an ill Ta&s;te or Smell.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Food of the Na|tives.</NOTE>The Inhabitants of <HI>Mu&s;catt</HI> feed pro|mi&s;cuou&s;ly upon either Fi&s;h or Fle&s;h; they eat Beef, Mutton, Goat and Deer, and the Fle&s;h of Camels is admir'd by them, and is in repute for a Healthful &s;ort of Meat. But they are very nice and curious in killing tho&s;e Animals on which they feed, and which they refu&s;e to ta&s;te 'till the Meat is cleans'd and wa&s;ht from the Blood. They abound too in many &s;orts of Fi&s;h, and are &s;cru|pulous in Eating of &s;ome kinds of them, &s;uch e&s;pecially as have no Scales, from

which they totally refrain, and e&s;teem the Food of &s;uch as well as of Blood, an Abomination. The Soil affords abun|dance of Wheat, which might be proper|ly made u&s;e of for their Bread, but the Dates are &s;o plentiful, &s;o plea&s;ant and admir'd, that they mix them with all their Food, and eat them in&s;tead of Bread, through all the&s;e parts of <HI>Arabia,</HI> both with their Fi&s;h and Fle&s;h.</P>
<P>But of all the Followers of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and zealous Admirers of his four princi|pal Doctors, <HI>Abu Becre, O&s;man, Omar</HI> and <HI>Hali,</HI> none are &s;o rigidly Ab&s;temi|ous as the <HI>Arabians</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;catt,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The great Ab&s;tinence of the Na|tives.</NOTE> as well from the Juice of the Grape, as other more common and innocent Liquors.

They were perfect &s;trangers both of them to each others Per&s;ons and Language, and therefore one among the re&s;t, who lookt like the Governour, rais'd a heap of Sand, as they &s;at near one another, upon the Shoar, which he divided into three parts, re&s;erving two to him&s;elf, and offering the other to the Captain. But the Captain e&s;teeming it unequally proportion'd, &s;hook his Head, in token that he di&s;lik'd the Bargain. The Governour &s;eeing this, adju&s;ted the matter with more equality,
<PB N="434" REF="230">

The Money which was brought on Shoar, and &s;aved from the Wrack, was twelve or fourteen Thou&s;and Pounds, which they contriv'd to divide in this manner. They tyed to a Stick two Baskets in&s;tead of a pair of Scales, and made them as equipoize as they could, and by the&s;e they weighed each parcel that was brought off from the Ship with great exactne&s;s; if there ap|pear'd any &s;eeming advantage in either Ballance, the Governour forc'd that al|ways upon the Captain, &s;o that he was not injur'd one Mite, nor in all that Ac|count lo&s;t a Farthing that was his Due.

While they were thus eager for his De&s;truction, and intent in ta|king away his Life, they e&s;pyed a Rich Prize which diverted their Fury and De&s;ign; for the Captain wore a &s;ett of Gold Buttons upon his Coat, which they pre&s;ently flew at upon the fir&s;t &s;ight, and were &s;o zealous for the Pur|cha&s;e, that he ran&s;om'd his Life by the price of his Gold.

<P>The method made u&s;e of in taking the Turtle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Di&s;cour&s;e concerning the Turtle.</NOTE> is carefully to ob&s;erve tho&s;e particular times they come on Shoar, to lay or hatch their Eggs, at which times they turn them by &s;urprizal upon their Backs, which is a Po&s;ture they are utterly unable to recover from, and are thereby fru&s;trated of all Defence or E&s;cape, and are a ready Prey to any that re&s;olves to &s;eize them. When the &s;en&s;ible Creatures find them&s;elves in this de&s;perate Po&s;ture, by which they know them&s;elves in a lo&s;t and hopele&s;s &s;tate, they then begin to lament their Condi|tion in many heavy &s;ighs, and mourn|ful Groans, and &s;hed abundance of water from their Eyes, in hopes, if po&s;&s;ible, to &s;ecure their Safety by their Tears, and Mollifie the cruel A&s;&s;aults upon their Lives.

The parts of Reptiles con|tinue, I think, animated for &s;ome con&s;i|derable time after they are di&s;&s;ected from one another, becau&s;e of the vi&s;cous Quality of their Animal Spirits, but for the Heart of &s;o large an Animal as this, to move for &s;ome Hours after it was torn from the Body, &s;eems a little more &s;trange and &s;urprizing.

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF A Late Revolution IN THE KINGDOM OF <HI>GOLCONDA.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Account of this Revolution, and tho&s;e other matters which are di&s;cours'd of in this Appen|dix, might have fallen in very luckily in &s;ome part of the preceding Voyage,
<PB N="526" REF="276">
had I been &s;o fortunate as to have had the peru&s;al of the Papers while the Book was a fini&s;hing; but not coming to my Hands 'till it was Printed, I thought it be&s;t to affix them to it, as both agreeable to the Subject, and con|taining things in them very remarkable and New: And mu&s;t needs own the peculiar Obligation I am under to a very worthy Gentleman, Mr. <HI>Daniel Sheldon,</HI> in the free and kind Commu|nication of the&s;e Memoirs. I &s;hall not therefore detain the Reader with a|ny further account of this matter, but pa&s;s on to what I am &s;atisfied will be very agreeable to him, <HI>viz.</HI> The Hi&s;to|ry of this Revolution in <HI>Golconda.</HI></P>
<P>The pre&s;ent King of <HI>Golconda</HI> was Son to an <HI>Arabian</HI> of good Family and E&s;teem, but low in E&s;tate and Fortune; to rai&s;e which, re&s;olving to Travel, and &s;eek Employment from &s;ome Foreign Prince, he came to <HI>Golconda;</HI> and, by the Favour of &s;ome per&s;ons of Quality, had the opportunity of pre&s;enting him|&s;elf and his Service to King <HI>Cotub &s;ha;</HI> who, being plea&s;ed with his Per&s;on and manner of Addre&s;s, gave him a &s;mall Government, wherein he behav'd
<PB N="527" REF="276">
him&s;elf &s;o well, that he was advanc'd to one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Com|mands in the Kingdom, in which and his Prince's favour he continued 'till his Death: After which his E&s;tate (being very great) was &s;eiz'd on by the King, who is the general Heir of all his Nobles and Per&s;ons employ'd by him (none of tho&s;e Countreys having any Heredita|ry E&s;tates) &s;o that his Son was reduc'd to a very poor Condition; but, ha|ving that left which could not be ta|ken from him, <HI>viz.</HI> his Father's Wit and Courage, he re&s;olv'd to follow his Example, hoping to find his Fortune. Full of which hopes he enters him&s;elf into <HI>Mun&s;ub</HI> (that is, the Kings Pay) and had allow'd him twelve or fifteen new <HI>Pagotha</HI>'s (which is about four Pounds &s;ixteen Shillings, or &s;ix Pounds Sterling) <HI>per</HI> Month, with which, and the hopes of better Preferment, he made a &s;hift to maintain him&s;elf. The King <HI>Cotub-&s;ha</HI> had at this time no Son, but three Daughters; the Elde&s;t of which was Married to Sultan <HI>Mamood,</HI> Elde&s;t Son to the <HI>Great Mogul, Aureng-Zebe:</HI> The &s;econd to an <HI>Arabian</HI> of great Quality, <HI>Meera Mamood;</HI> and the
<PB N="528" REF="277">
third was unmarried: To this unmar|ried Daughter an <HI>Arabian</HI> of high Birth and Quality called <HI>Siud Sultan,</HI> was an importunate Suitor; and the King grown Old, and oppre&s;s'd with the Fa|ctions of tho&s;e to whom he had left the management of Affairs (having all his time wholly minded Plea&s;ures, and left Bu&s;ine&s;s and the Concerns of the King|dom to the Cares of others) and mor|tally hating Sultan <HI>Mamood</HI> (who by a cruel War, almo&s;t to the utter Ruine of him and his Kingdom, had forc'd his Con&s;ent to the Marryage of his Elde&s;t Daughter, hoping thereby, after <HI>Cotub-&s;ha</HI>'s Death, to add the Kingdom of <HI>Golconda</HI> to the Empire of the <HI>Great Mogul)</HI> and having no Kindne&s;s for his &s;econd Daughter or her Husband, but being extreamly fond of his Younge&s;t, he de&s;ign'd to Marry her to one who&s;e Quality, Parts, and Courage, might make him able either to break or ma|nage the Factions of his Court; with|&s;tand Sultan <HI>Mamood,</HI> who he re&s;olv'd &s;hould not &s;ucceed him; and one, who being rais'd by his Favour, he thought would wholly depend upon it, and there|by only expect the Succe&s;&s;ion. And
<PB N="529" REF="277">
this Young Servant to his Daughter, being an <HI>Arabian</HI> (who in the&s;e Coun|treys are thought the Wi&s;e&s;t and fit|te&s;t for Government) and of the Ca&s;t of the <HI>Siuds</HI> (that is of the Family or Kindred of <HI>Mahumet,</HI> and there|fore much reverenc'd by all) likewi&s;e of a brisk and lively Wit and Spirit: He thought him a fit Per&s;on by whom to manage his De&s;igns, and con&s;e|quently to Marry his Daughter; there|fore countenanc'd his Adre&s;&s;es to her; but the young Man was &s;o dazled with the pro&s;pect of &s;o glorious a Fortune, that he could not &s;ee his right way to it; for, pre&s;uming too &s;oon upon the King and Prince&s;&s;es Fa|vour, in&s;tead of contriving how to in|crea&s;e and &s;trengthen his Intere&s;t, by gaining the Con&s;ent and Support of the great Mini&s;ters of State; he car|ried him&s;elf &s;o in&s;olently towards them, that he utterly di&s;oblig'd, and made him&s;elf hateful to them; and they fear|ing the Tyranny of one who, when their Equal, began to exerci&s;e it over them, re&s;olv'd to di&s;grace and ruin him, by hindring the Match. The chiefe&s;t Per&s;ons about the King, were <HI>Mo&s;o
<PB N="530" REF="278">
Cawne, Siud Meer Zapher,</HI> and <HI>Mus&s;huke,</HI> the&s;e three managed the King and his great Affairs; for <HI>Meera Mamood,</HI> the King's Son in Law, being not in Fa|vour, was not in Bu&s;ine&s;s; yet not &s;o quite laid a&s;ide, but that he had free Acce&s;s to the Court and Pre&s;ence, and was by all re&s;pected as one, that ha|ving Married the King's Second Daughter (Circum&s;tances con&s;ider'd) was likely enough to &s;ucceed him. Therefore having great hopes (and not enduring the In&s;olent Carriage of this new Favourite, nor to think of his Marrying the King's beloved Daugh|ter) put him&s;elf in the Head of the Faction again&s;t him: And the Old Courtiers perfectly knowing the King, and the u&s;ual and &s;ure&s;t ways of work|ing him to their De&s;igns, &s;oon un&s;etled the unwary young Man in his Af|fections, and then threw him from the height of his Prince's Favour, to the contempt and &s;corn of the meane&s;t Subject. For they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his Ma|je&s;ty with an Opinion, that he was an high Spirited, Ambitious Man, and aim'd at great things; that he was at the Head of a great Party and Facti|on
<PB N="531" REF="278">
at Court; that if he were once &s;trengthen'd with &s;o near an Alliance to the King, he might do what&s;oever he de&s;ign'd; what he de&s;ign'd they knew not, but he gave them great Rea&s;on to fear, it was not his Maje|&s;ty's &s;afety, nor the Kingdom's Peace; and Affairs being wholy manag'd by their Directions, and all Officers at Court about the King being their Creatures, they made their Information &s;eem more than probable. The King being naturally jealous, and frighted with the Shadow of any thing that he thought might di&s;turb his Plea&s;ures, was quickly per&s;waded not to marry the Prince&s;s to &s;o dangerous a Per&s;on, and immediately upon the breaking off the Match, one of the three Per&s;ons before mention'd, ('tis not certainly known which of them, but thought <HI>Mus&s;huke)</HI> advis'd his Maje&s;ty to find out &s;ome one for the Prince&s;s of &s;mall Fortune, but noble Birth and Courage; a comly Per&s;on, and of a generous and chearful Di&s;po&s;ition, and inclin'd ra|ther to Plea&s;ures than Bu&s;ine&s;s; for, if he was qualified with high Birth, and the Endowments of Nature, it lay in
<PB N="532" REF="279">
the King's Power to &s;upply the Defects of Honour, Riches, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and Men of &s;uch Di&s;po&s;itions (being given to Plea|&s;ure) were &s;eldom ambitious or de|&s;igning; therefore &s;uch a one being Created meerly by his Favour, would wholly &s;ubmit by it, and enjoying what he mo&s;t de&s;ir'd, (his Plea&s;ures) would not di&s;turb him&s;elf or them with the thoughts of Bu&s;ine&s;s, or Cares of Government, but be Obedient and perfectly contented with the Condition he was in, without a&s;piring to un|timely Greatne&s;s. The Advice was liked, and communicated to the two o|ther Coun&s;elors, who (con&s;idering it was a way for continuing them in their Governments, and all Affairs and Bu&s;i|ne&s;s in their management) confirmed the King, by approving of the Coun|&s;el given him; and having his Order to find out &s;uch a Per&s;on, the Young <HI>Arabian</HI> Souldier (who&s;e Father's E|&s;tate had been &s;eiz'd on by the King) was propos'd as one every way qua|lified according to the King's de&s;ire. He is therefore &s;ent for by <HI>Ziud Meer Zapher</HI> to his Hou&s;e, and (the King be|ing plac'd where he might perfectly
<PB N="533" REF="279">
&s;ee and hear, without being taken no|tice of) <HI>Ziud Meer Zapher</HI> entertain'd the Young Souldier with &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e concerning the Greatne&s;s and Merits of his Father; how much he was belov'd and favour'd by the King; told him he was &s;orry to &s;ee the Son of &s;o great a Man in &s;o low a Condition; promis'd his A&s;&s;i&s;tance in getting &s;ome hand&s;om Command for him; bid him there|fore be chearful and not dejected and Melancholy: And after he thought the King had fully view'd, di&s;mi&s;s'd him. When he was gone, the King told <HI>Ziud Meer Zapher,</HI> he was not &s;o comly a Per&s;on as he was pre&s;ented to be, nor had he that Life and Vigour in his Countenance, that he would wil|lingly have in the Per&s;on he made choice of. To which <HI>Meer Zapher</HI> re|ply'd, that his Maje&s;ty rather &s;aw his Misfortunes than the Man him&s;elf; for, being the Son of &s;o great a Per&s;on, and having liv'd in all the plenty of his Father's Great E&s;tate, to be now reduc'd to the poor Condition and Al|lowance of an Ordinary Hor&s;e-man, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity make melancholy Im|pre&s;&s;ions both upon his Body and
<PB N="534" REF="280">
Mind; but if his Wants were &s;upply|ed with Money to maintain him ac|cording to his Birth and Quality, he would quickly come to, and appear like him&s;elf, and to be &s;uch a one as his Maje&s;ty &s;ought for. The King re|&s;olves to try, and therefore orders <HI>Meer Zapher</HI> to contrive how to fur|ni&s;h him with as much Money as he would have, without letting him know the Bountiful Hand that reliev'd him. Immediately &s;ome <HI>Xeruffs,</HI> (or Money Merchants) are &s;ent for, and <HI>Meer Za|pher</HI> gives them directions to offer and let him have as much Money as he would take, promi&s;ing to &s;ee them re|paid again; but &s;trictly Commanded them (upon the forfeiture, not only of their Money, but Lives) not to let him know they had any &s;uch Order to fur|ni&s;h him. Away the <HI>Xeruffs</HI> go and give him &s;everal Vi&s;its, under a pretence of de&s;iring his A&s;&s;i&s;tance in &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s they had with &s;ome great Men; for, he being a Man of high Birth and Quality (&s;uch Per&s;ons tho' never &s;o poor, being by all much re&s;pected in tho&s;e Countries) would have better Acce&s;s, and be &s;ooner heard and ta|ken

<P>In the mean time the two great men (or rather Kings) &s;trove who &s;hould procure the fine&s;t Women, be&s;t Min|&s;trels and Dancers to divert the King, thinking by &s;uch Charms to continue him in the Lethargy they thought he was in.

At fir&s;t he was &s;o out of his Wits, that he would not, but (being per&s;waded by better temper'd Men, and his Friends) at la&s;t he return'd to his own Hou&s;e, leaving the <HI>Duan</HI> half dead with Fear; who coming to him&s;elf, goes immedi|ately

to the King, and de&s;ires him to con&s;ider with what &s;afety he could be in his Palace, if &s;uch Outrages were committed in the Garri&s;on. The King calmly tells him, he will take care both for his own, and his future &s;afety, by preventing &s;uch Violences for the time to come, and by perfectly reconciling the General to him; and tho' the <HI>Duan</HI> knew that to be impo&s;&s;ible, yet &s;eems to go away contented.

thinking he had no Equal in the King's Favour, takes upon him to meddle in every Man's matter, depriving &s;eve|ral of the Benefit of their Places, by taking their Bu&s;ine&s;s out of their Hands; and the King lets him go on without taking notice of &s;mall Pre&s;umptions, &s;o that by degrees he grows &s;o confident of his own Authority, and the King's neglect, that he begins to do things of the greate&s;t Con&s;equence, without ac|quainting his Maje&s;ty; and at la&s;t (ha|ving made him&s;elf hateful, by doing and undoing every Man's Bu&s;ine&s;s, according to his own Intere&s;t and De|&s;igns) his Ruin was &s;o generally wi&s;h'd, that there was a nece&s;&s;ity of removing &s;o great a grievance; which gave the King a fit opportunity of doing what he had &s;o long de&s;ign'd.

his own Vindication and publick Ju&s;tice, on the behalf of his oppre&s;s'd and in|jur'd Subjects: However as a Reward of &s;ome former good Services he had done, he gave him his Life and the Go|vernment of &s;uch a Province, com|manding him immediately (upon the forfeiture of both) to retire to his Go|vernment, and for the future not to meddle with any Bu&s;ine&s;s but what concern'd it.

<P>The Quarrel about the&s;e Jewels is &s;aid to have cau&s;ed as much Blood|&s;hed among the Neighbouring Kings hereabouts, as might have been &s;uffici|ent for the obtaining an entire Em|pire; the Conte&s;t being not &s;o much for the value of the Jewels, as that they are &s;uppos'd to bring along with them a right, or at lea&s;t a claim of Do|minion over the Neighbouring Princes. And now they are in the Hands of this King, but never worn by him, except upon the Day of his Coronation.

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS Concerning the Nature of the <HI>SILK-WORMS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN <HI>India</HI> the <HI>Silk-Worms</HI> in <HI>Novem|ber</HI> are in Eggs 12 Days. Or ac|cording to the Natives Account, one <HI>Aggoa,</HI> from which the Silk then made, is called <HI>Aggoued-bund,</HI> and is the be&s;t that is made all the Year. After twelve Days from the fir&s;t of <HI>November,</HI> the Worms are hatch'd, or come out of their Eggs, and are laid upon Matts.</P>
<P>The four fir&s;t Days after they are laid upon Matts, they give them Mul|berry Leaves, cut into &s;mall thin pieces, to feed upon Four times a Day, <HI>viz.</HI> Morning, Noon, and at 3 and 9 a Clock.</P>
<P><PB N="600" REF="317">The 5th Day they mu&s;t not be fed at all.</P>
<P>The 6th day the Worms will be &s;omewhat bigger, and mu&s;t be fed with big pieces of Leaves, and that four times a Day, according to the times before mention'd.</P>
<P>The 7th, 8th, 9th, feed them as on the 6th day.</P>
<P>The 10th Day they mu&s;t not be fed at all.</P>
<P>The 11th Day they mu&s;t be fed with larger pieces of Leaves, and four times a day, as formerly.</P>
<P>The 12th day they are to be fed with whole Leaves, and four times a Day.</P>
<P>The 13th and 14th they mu&s;t not be fed at all.</P>
<P>The 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, they mu&s;t be fed with whole Leaves, and four times a day.</P>
<P>The 19th Day, feed them five times, <HI>viz.</HI> Morning, Noon, at 3, and 9 a Clock, and at Mid-night, and con|tinue to feed them &s;o to the 26th in|clu&s;ive.</P>
<P><PB N="601" REF="317">The Worms from about the 14th day, will begin to be green, and at the 26th day will be about 2&frac14; Inches long.</P>
<P>The 17th day they will be of a Co|lour like Yellow and White, and then you mu&s;t not feed them any more, becau&s;e they begin to &s;pin.</P>
<P>The 28th day, they mu&s;t be put upon Ledges of Matt, fa&s;ten'd to a large piece of round Matting, the Led|ges being about an Inch high from the Mat, and running round like a Screw, beginning at the Center of the Mat, and running round at about a hand|ful or three Inches di&s;tance to the Cir|cumference. When the Worms are put upon tho&s;e Ledges, they &s;et the Mats leaning in the Sun, about 8 in the Morning, and let them &s;tand for 1&frac12; Hour; then they put them into the Hou&s;e or Shade, leaning again&s;t the Wall; after, at 4 a Clock in the After|noon, they put them again into the Sun, and let them &s;tand 'till Sun-Set; then they put them in the Hou&s;e or Shade, leaning again&s;t a Wall, and in this Day and Night's time, they will have made their Hou&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="602" REF="318">The 29th Day they take the Worms with their new Silk Hou&s;es, and put them upon other Mats, flat, without any Ledges or Partitions, and &s;o lay &s;everal Mats upon Frames one over another.</P>
<P>The 30, 31, 32, and 33 days, they &s;pin within their Hou&s;es of Silk, and then they take each Worm with its Hou&s;e, and &s;hake it at their Ears, and tho&s;e that are alive, they are good, and fit for Breeders, which are kept for &s;uch, and tho&s;e that make no noi&s;e are dead, having &s;pun away their Life. Sometimes &frac18; &frac14; 1/16 live; &s;ometimes more, and &s;ometimes le&s;s; for great Heats and Colds kill many.</P>
<P>The 34, 35, 36, 37th days, they con|tinue &s;pinning.</P>
<P>The 38th day the Worms eat thro' their Hou&s;es, and are like a Butterfly; after which they take up their Hou&s;es, and put the Worms upon new Mats; the Males they know by their &s;lender|ne&s;s, and the Females by the contra|ry, which, being plac'd near each o|ther, join; but if there be more of one &s;ort than the other, then after they have done with the le&s;&s;er number, ei|ther

Males or Females, they join them with the re&s;t, and let them lie all Night.</P>
<P>The 39th day they throw away the Males.</P>
<P>The 40th the Females lay their Eggs, after which they throw them away likewi&s;e. So that the whole Life of the&s;e Worms, is but 12 days in the Egg, and 40 days out of it; in all 52 Days.</P>
<P>The next Silk is made in <HI>January;</HI> and then the Worms are fourteen days in the Egg, and 40 afterwards before they die. This Silk is called <HI>Maug-Bund,</HI> and is the Sixth, and wor&s;t &s;ort of Silk. The making of it ends about <HI>February</HI> the 14th.</P>
<P>The next is made from <HI>February</HI> the 14th to the 24th of <HI>March,</HI> and is cal|led <HI>Cheita-bund.</HI> The Worms &s;tay in the Eggs 8 days, and live 32 days af|ter. This is e&s;teem'd the &s;econd &s;ort for goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>The next is <HI>Sauk-Bund,</HI> e&s;teem'd the fifth &s;ort for Goodne&s;s. The Worms &s;tay in their Eggs 8 days, and live 32 days after. The making of this Silk ends about the 6th of <HI>May.</HI></P>

<P>This is the Nature of the <HI>Silk-worms</HI> in the <HI>Indies</HI> where the Heat of the Sun renders them much more fruitful than with us; for in <HI>India</HI> the Worms breed and &s;pin their Silk &s;ix times in the Year, and in <HI>England</HI> only once, be|cau&s;e here they remain in the Egg from the latter end of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 'till a|bout the latter end of <HI>May.</HI> There likewi&s;e they are &s;ooner brought to per|fection, and begin to work &s;ooner, <HI>viz.</HI> 28 days after they are hatcht, but in <HI>England</HI> not 'till the 40th. Where al&s;o they are by a third part more tedious in breaking out of their Hou&s;es, from the fir&s;t day of their Spinning, than they are in the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> which is there done in ten days, but here only in fif|teen.</P>
<P><PB N="605" REF="320">The Silk-worm derives its Birth from the Seed of the Butterfly, which is as &s;mall as the Heads of Pins, and does &s;omewhat re&s;emble Rape-Seed, being flatted on both &s;ides. This In|&s;ect, by who&s;e Indu&s;try we have the Silk, which is &s;pun out of its Bowels, and artificially form'd by its Mouth into the Fa&s;hion of a Clew, differs not very much from a Caterpillar, either in the Shape or Bulk, baiting that this is more Hairy, and its Web is weaker, and of another Colour. And yet for want of Mulberry-Leaves (which is the mo&s;t proper Food for the Silk-Worm) when they are forc'd to &s;ub|&s;i&s;t by the Leaves of the Ro&s;e-Bu&s;h, Lettice, or &s;ome others (which &s;ome|times are made u&s;e of) this Nouri&s;h|ment either weakens the Thread they Spin, and makes it as u&s;ele&s;s as that of the Caterpillars, or el&s;e they will not work at all. But that which &s;eems mo&s;t remarkable and wonderful in this Animal, is its change of &s;hape, and one would think of Species, in the transformation of it from a Reptile to a Volatile, from a creeping Worm into a Butterfly.
