<P>THE Country of <HI>Malabar</HI> begins at <HI>Cana|nor,</HI> a Town in the Northern <HI>Latitude</HI> of 11 degrees and 20 minutes, and ends at Cape <HI>Comorim,</HI> in the Northern <HI>Latitude</HI> of 7 degrees and &frac23;ds.</P>
<P>It contains divers Kingdoms, as <HI>Cochim, Tra|vancor, Gundaca, Pimenta, Margate,</HI> &amp;c. and a|bounds with Ports, as <HI>Calecut, Cale, Cochim, Cou|lam,</HI> &amp;c. Mo&s;t of its Princes and Nations are <HI>Heathens,</HI> and extreamly &s;uper&s;titious in the Wor|&s;hip
<PB N="2" REF="13"> of <HI>Pagods,</HI> of which there are &s;everal a|mong them of incredible Riches.</P>
<P>The <HI>Serra</HI> or <HI>Gate,</HI> as the Natives call it, is a Ridge of Mountains running 200 Leagues from North to South, the South end whereof is inha|bited by Chri&s;tians, who call them&s;elves the <HI>Chri|&s;tians of St. Thomas,</HI> upon the account of their ha|ving fir&s;t been converted to the Chri&s;tian Faith by the Apo&s;tle of that Name.

<PB N="16" REF="20"> affirmed, it is plainly contradicted by the 33d <HI>Arabick</HI> Canon of the Council of <HI>Nice,</HI> which tho' not the genuine Canons of that Council, are yet very ancient. The Canon runs thus:
<Q><HI>Canon 33.</HI> Let the See of <HI>Seleucia,</HI> which is one of the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> Cities, be honoured likewi&s;e, and have the Title of <HI>Catholicon,</HI> and let the Prelate thereof, ordain Arch-Bi&s;hops as the o|ther Patriarchs do, that &s;o the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> Chri|&s;tians who live under Heathens, may not be wronged by waiting the Patriarch of <HI>Antioch</HI>'s lei&s;ure, or by going to him, but may have a way opened to them to &s;upply their own Nece&s;&s;ities; neither will any injury be done to the Patriarch of <HI>Antioch</HI> thereby, &s;eeing he has con&s;ented to its being thus, upon the Synod's having de&s;ired it of him.</Q></P>
<P>From which Canon it is plain, That the Church of <HI>Seleucia</HI> or <HI>Babylon</HI> was anciently &s;ubject to the Patriarch of <HI>Antioch,</HI> who of all the Patriarchs was their nighe&s;t Neighbour. So that if the <HI>Chal|daean</HI> Bi&s;hops do own that they derived all their Authority from the <HI>We&s;tern</HI> Fathers, as is pre|tended they do, they mu&s;t mean by the <HI>We&s;tern</HI> Fathers, the Bi&s;hops of <HI>Antioch.</HI></P>

<PB N="17" REF="20"> &s;aid, but from the whole Tenor of the following Synod, and of all the late Reports of the <HI>Por|tuguezes</HI> concerning that Church: As it does like|wi&s;e, That all tho&s;e Patriarchs of <HI>Babylon,</HI> who came to <HI>Rome,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the great Noi&s;e they made in this Part of the World, were mere Impo&s;tors, never owned by the Churches they pre|tended to be Patriarchs of.

<P><HI>Mar Abraham,</HI> having well con&s;idered the matter, and perceiving how difficult it would be for him to e&s;cape being Dragoon'd by the <HI>Portuguezes,</HI> who&s;e power increa&s;ed daily in tho&s;e Parts, if he &s;hould di&s;obey this Summons, deter|mined, whatever came on it, to repair to the Council, at which he a&s;&s;i&s;ted, and was obliged once more to Abjure, and make a profe&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Roman</HI> Faith, promi&s;ing withal, to &s;ee all the Decrees made in that <HI>Synod,</HI> in relation to his Bi&s;hoprick, punctually executed, and to &s;end in all the Heretick Books in his Dioce&s;s to be burn|ed or amended; and having confe&s;&s;ed, that in <HI>the Ordination of Prie&s;ts</HI> there was no Wine in the Cup, which he delivered into their hands, toge|ther with the Ho&s;t, he was commanded to Or|dain all that he had Ordained before over-again.</P>
<P>Now if this, of there being no Wine in the Cup, which was delivered into the hands of tho&s;e who were Ordained <HI>Prie&s;ts,</HI> was the only ground whereon the <HI>Romani&s;ts</HI> founded the in|validity of the <HI>Chaldaean</HI> Orders, as it is the only thing they have been plea&s;ed to in&s;tance in, what a &s;tretch was this to invalidate the Orders of a whole Church by?

I am &s;ure the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> has much more rea&s;on to apprehend that the Sacrilege of denying the Cup to the Laity

<P>But after all this &s;tir, the Doctrine of the deli|vering the Bread and Cup into the hands of tho&s;e who are to be ordained Prie&s;ts, being e&s;|&s;ential to Orders, is &s;o far from being true, that it is owned to be a Novelty by all the Modern Learned Divines of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and is moreover contradicted by her daily Practice, who, as all the World knows, allows the <HI>Greek Orders</HI> to be good, in the Collation whereof &s;he knows, the Bread and Cup is not put into the hands of tho&s;e who are ordained Prie&s;ts.</P>
<P>It is true, the Council of <HI>Florence,</HI> in her In|&s;tructions to the <HI>Armenians,</HI> &s;eems to have doted into the &s;ame Error with this of the <HI>Portuguezes,</HI> in making that new Ceremony e&s;&s;ential to <HI>Orders.</HI> But let that be as it will, it is certain that both the pre&s;ent practice of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, and all her truly Learned <HI>Sons,</HI> the Modern <HI>Schoolmen</HI> not excepted, do condemn it as an Error; for which I &s;hall only quote two of her mo&s;t emi|nent Schoolmen, and one of her able&s;t Criticks.</P>

<P>When the Arch-Bi&s;hop was vi&s;iting the City of <HI>Damaon,</HI> he received Letters of the 16th. of <HI>Feb.</HI> 1597. from the Viceroy <HI>Matthias Dalbuquer|que,</HI> advi&s;ing him of the Death of <HI>Mar Abra|ham.</HI> On the &s;ame day he received this news, he in obedience to the Pope's <HI>Brief,</HI> con&s;tituted <HI>Franci&s;co Roz,</HI> a <HI>Je&s;uite,</HI> and who was afterwards made Bi&s;hop of the <HI>Serra,</HI> Governour and <HI>Vicar-Apo&s;tolical</HI> of the &s;aid Dioce&s;s.</P>
<P>The <HI>May</HI> following the Arch-Bi&s;hop being re|turned to <HI>Goa,</HI> a Con&s;ultation was held about the Affairs of the Church of the <HI>Serra,</HI> where it was unanimou&s;ly agreed; that notwith&s;tanding the Pope in his <HI>Brief</HI> had commanded none to be made Governour or <HI>Vicar Apo&s;tolical</HI> of the Dioce&s;s, but what was of the <HI>Roman</HI> Communi|on, it was convenient to nominate the pre&s;ent Arch-Deacon to it, which they did, joining <HI>Franci&s;co Roz,</HI> and the <HI>Rector</HI> of the <HI>Je&s;uites</HI>-College of <HI>Vaipicotta,</HI> in Commi&s;&s;ion with him. But it being required of the Arch-Deacon, that he &s;hou'd &s;ub&s;cribe the Profe&s;&s;ion of Faith made by <HI>Pius</HI> IV. before he had his Patent he decli|ned doing it, pretending he was not &s;atisfied
<PB N="45" REF="34"> with having two joyned with him in Com|mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Arch-Bi&s;hop, tho' he was &s;en&s;ible that it was the Sub&s;cription that &s;tuck with him chiefly, thought fit to di&s;&s;emble, &s;o far as to &s;eem to be|lieve him, and by a new Patent con&s;tituted him the &s;ole Governour of the Bi&s;hoprick.</P>
<P>The Arch-Deacon accepted of this Patent, but at the &s;ame time declared, That it gave him no Authority but what he had before; but when he was called upon to Sub&s;cribe the forementi|oned Profe&s;&s;ion of Faith, he de&s;ired four Months to con&s;ider of it, hoping by that time a Bi&s;hop might be &s;ent them by the Patriarch of <HI>Babylon,</HI> when the four Months were expired. Being ur|ged a fre&s;h to Sub&s;cribe, he told them flatly, that he would never do it, nor &s;ubmit to the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, which he was &s;ure had nothing to do with the Apo&s;tolical Church of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> no more than that of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> had to do with the <HI>Roman.</HI> And not being &s;atisfied with having made this Declaration as to him&s;elf, he further|more a&s;&s;embled a Synod of mo&s;t of the Prie&s;ts, and mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial Chri&s;tians at <HI>Angamale,</HI> the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of the Dioce&s;s, where they all &s;wore to &s;tand by their <HI>Arch-Deacon,</HI> in the defence of the ancient Faith they and their Fore-fathers had been bred up in, &s;o as not to &s;uffer the lea&s;t alte|ration to be made therein, nor ever to admit of any Bi&s;hop, but what &s;hould be &s;ent them by the Patriarch of <HI>Babylon;</HI> of all which they made a publick In&s;trument, and having Sworn to main|tain
<PB N="46" REF="35"> it with their Lives and Fortunes, ordered it to be publi&s;hed thorow the whole Dioce&s;s.</P>
<P>After the meeting of this Synod, the Chri&s;ti|ans of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> came to be &s;o far enraged again&s;t the <HI>Latins,</HI> for what they had done to de&s;troy their ancient Faith, and for their having treated &s;o many of their Arch-Bi&s;hops, &s;o barbarou&s;ly as they had done, that they would &s;uffer no <HI>Latin</HI> Prie&s;t to officiate in their Churches, nor &s;o much as to live among them. Two <HI>Je&s;uites,</HI> one at <HI>Angamale,</HI> and another at <HI>Carturte,</HI> having very narrowly e&s;caped being murdered by them. The <HI>Je&s;uites,</HI> and other <HI>Latin</HI> Prie&s;ts, were &s;o far inti|midated, by the fury that Synod had put that whole Chri&s;tianity into, that for &s;ome time none of them were found &s;o hardy, as to ven|ture to go among them.</P>
<P>The news of this great and unexpected Heat, as it did &s;trangely afflict the Arch-Bi&s;hop, who had &s;et his Heart &s;o much on the reducing of tho&s;e Chri&s;tians; &s;o it was the thing that made him re&s;olve to go in Per&s;on to the <HI>Serra</HI> to try what his Pre&s;ence and Authority would do.</P>
<P>Not only the Viceroy, but the whole Clergy and Laity, and particularly the whole Chapter of <HI>Goa,</HI> together in a body, did all they could, as it is &s;aid, to di&s;&s;wade him from &s;o dangerous an enterpri&s;e, but tho' he was deaf to all the Re|mon&s;trances of his Friends, yet upon a War breaking out &s;uddenly in the Year 1598. betwixt the Kings of <HI>Mangate</HI> and <HI>Paru,</HI> in who&s;e Ter|ritories mo&s;t of the&s;e Chri&s;tian Churches &s;tand,

<P>The Arch-Deacon, when he received this Let|ter, dreading nothing &s;o much as the Arch-Bi|&s;hop's coming in Per&s;on among them, declared that he had refu&s;ed to Sub&s;cribe the forementi|oned Profe&s;&s;ion of Faith, for no other rea&s;on, but becau&s;e he was Commanded to do it before the Rector of the <HI>Je&s;uites</HI> College of <HI>Vaipicotta,</HI> with whom and his whole Order he pretended to be ju&s;tly di&s;&s;atisfied, giving the Arch-Bi&s;hop to under&s;tand at the &s;ame time, that if he would order any other Prie&s;t or Friar to take his Sub|&s;cription, that he was ready to make it.</P>
<P>But the Arch-Bi&s;hop looking upon this only as a Trick to throw an <HI>Odium</HI> upon the whole Order of <HI>Je&s;uites,</HI> and that for no other rea&s;on, but becau&s;e they were the mo&s;t indu&s;trious in the reduction of tho&s;e Chri&s;tians to the <HI>Roman</HI> Faith, would not comply with the Arch-Deacon's Re|que&s;t, in naming &s;ome body el&s;e to take his Sub|&s;cription; for which Conduct the Arch-Bi&s;hop was very much blamed, mo&s;t People, and e&s;pe|cially the other Orders of Friars murmuring a|gain&s;t him, as one grown &s;o fond of the <HI>Je&s;uites,</HI> as to lo&s;e the reduction of &s;o many thou&s;and

It is furthermore &s;aid, that <HI>Mar Abraham,</HI> when he was upon his Death-bed called the Rector of the College of <HI>Vaipicotta</HI> to him, and having all his Clergy about him, declared, that he commit|ted his Flock to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Rome,</HI> as the chief Pa&s;tor and Prelate of the whole Church, and Commanded the Arch-Deacon, and all his Prie&s;ts,
<PB N="49" REF="36"> to obey the <HI>Je&s;uites,</HI> whom his <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> had &s;ent to cultivate that Vineyard in all things, and to be &s;ure to follow the Doctrines that they taught, which were the whole truth, and nothing but the truth; after which Charge he is &s;aid further|more to have be&s;eeched and conjured the Rector, by <HI>the love of Chri&s;t,</HI> and the <HI>great friend&s;hip</HI> there had been always between them, to take care of the Government of his Church after his Death, and to have ordered an authentick in&s;trument to be made of all this to remain as a Te&s;timony of his la&s;t Will, and of the Faith he died in.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Hi&s;tory furthermore tells us, That this Church was &s;o far reconciled to the Pope, in the Year, 1596. that when the <HI>Jubile</HI> of <HI>Clement</HI> VIII. was publi&s;hed among them by the <HI>Je&s;uites,</HI> they gave his <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> a thou&s;and Ble&s;|&s;ings for it, and took a &s;ingular plea&s;ure in pro|nouncing his Name; and that during the whole time of the <HI>Jubile,</HI> they were at Church from Morning to Night, without taking any refection, and were &s;o zealous to confe&s;s them&s;elves to the Fathers, that they waited in the Church till Mid|night in great Crowds to do it. Now accor|ding to this report of things, the Arch-Bi&s;hop, when he came into the <HI>Serra,</HI> had little more to do than to open his Arms to embrace a People, who, being before hand prepared by the <HI>Je&s;uites,</HI> were ready to throw them&s;elves into them.</P>
<P>But to leave Romance, and return to Hi&s;tory, having only ob&s;erved by the way, that it is vi|&s;ible from this gro&s;s mi&s;repre&s;entation of tho&s;e

<P>But a thing happened at this time, which, tho' in it &s;elf not con&s;iderable, did abundantly ma|nife&s;t how little di&s;po&s;ed the Clergy of this Church was to &s;ubmit to the <HI>Pope.</HI></P>
<P>A Boy, that went to School to the <HI>Je&s;uites</HI> at <HI>Vaipicotta,</HI> having been taught by them to name the Pope in his Prayers before the Patriarch of <HI>Babylon,</HI> being over-heard doing it in the Church by &s;ome of the <HI>Malabar</HI> Prie&s;ts, was, after they had beat him &s;everely, turned out of the Church; they &s;poke al&s;o to his Father to whip him out of pray|ing for the Pope, who, they &s;aid, was none of their Prelate, nor had any thing to do with them. The Arch-Bi&s;hop being informed thereof, writ immediately to the Arch Deacon, commanding him to make Examples of tho&s;e impudent He|reticks, for what they had &s;aid and done to the Boy: which the Arch-Deacon was &s;o far from doing, that he Honoured them the more for it.

<P>The Arch-Deacon having nothing to object again&s;t the <HI>Franci&s;can</HI> Friar, and being extreamly de&s;irous, if it was po&s;&s;ible, to keep the Arch-Bi&s;hop from coming into the <HI>Serra,</HI> tho' he refu|&s;ed to Sub&s;cribe the Creed of <HI>Pius</HI> IV. yet con|de&s;cended to Sub&s;cribe a Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith, wherein he profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf a <HI>Catholick,</HI> and that he believed <HI>as the Church believed,</HI> but without naming the <HI>Roman,</HI> or acknowledging the Pope as univer&s;al Pa&s;tor of the Church; he is furthermore &s;aid, upon the Arch-Bi&s;hop's &s;ig|nifying his di&s;&s;atisfaction at the ambiguous Pro|fe&s;&s;ion he had made, to have given his con&s;ent publickly to that of <HI>Pius</HI> IV. being read to him in <HI>Portugueze,</HI> of which he did not under&s;tand a Syllable.

<P>On the 27th. of <HI>December,</HI> 1598. the Arch-Bi&s;hop Embarked upon a Gally Commanded by <HI>Don Alvaro de Menezes,</HI> and on the day of <HI>Epi|phany,</HI> arrived at the Bar of <HI>Cunahle,</HI> where he joined the whole <HI>Portugueze</HI> Armada, Comman|ded by the Viceroy's Brother, he was &s;aluted with all the Guns and Mu&s;ick of the Fleet; and having called a Council of War, and heard the &s;everal Opinions of all the Captains con|cerning the be&s;t way to take <HI>Cunahle,</HI> he di&s;patch|ed the re&s;olution they had come to thereon, to the Council of State at <HI>Goa;</HI> a mo&s;t Apo&s;tolical begin|ning of a Vi&s;itation.

<P>Next day, when the Magi&s;trates of the City came to Complement him at his Hou&s;e, he ac|quainted them with his de&s;ign of reducing the Chri&s;tians of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> before he returned to

<P>The day following His <HI>Grace</HI> having called the common Council of the City together, re|commended the enterpri&s;e of <HI>Cunahle</HI> to them, whom he made &s;o &s;en&s;ible of how great impor|tance it was to their City above all others, to have that Fortre&s;s wre&s;ted out of the hands of the <HI>Ma|hometan</HI> Pyrates, who had lately made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of it, that they immediately cau&s;ed 150 Men to be Rai&s;ed and Armed at their own Charge, whom, together with a great quantity of all &s;orts of Ammunition, they &s;ent upon five &s;tout Ships to joyn the <HI>Armada</HI> before <HI>Cunahle;</HI> the Arch-Bi|&s;hop al&s;o, to give the more life to the enterpri&s;e, &s;ent one of the be&s;t of his own <HI>Manchua's</HI> or Yachts, mann'd with his own menial Servants, along with them.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Cochim</HI> was much troubled to hear of the Arch-Bi&s;hop's being &s;o hot upon the re|duction of <HI>Cunahle,</HI> being &s;en&s;ible that a Peace betwixt the <HI>Portuguezes</HI> and the <HI>Samorim,</HI> with|out who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance by Land, it wou'd be hard for them to reduce that Fortre&s;s, mu&s;t be the Con|&s;equence of the enterpri&s;e. And as there had been nothing, the Kings of <HI>Cochim</HI> had been always more careful to hinder &s;uch a Peace, which they than did on purpo&s;e to keep the <HI>Portuguezes</HI> in a clo&s;er dependance upon them; &s;o the pre&s;ent King fol|lowing the wi&s;e mea&s;ures of his Ance&s;tors, en|deavour'd, by a Stratagem, to de&s;troy the Con|fidence he &s;aw the <HI>Portuguezes</HI> had already repo|&s;ed

<P>The <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop,</HI> who under&s;tood the In|trigues of Princes, as well as any Man living, returned the King his Thanks for his Intelligence, but withal &s;ent him word, that they were re|&s;olved to tru&s;t the <HI>Samorim</HI> in this occa&s;ion; and the rather, becau&s;e they did not want Power to be revenged on all that &s;hould deceive the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> either in Peace or War.</P>
<P>The King, when he found his Plot had not &s;ucceeded according to his expectation, re&s;olved to divert the <HI>Samorim</HI> from &s;ending an Army to <HI>Cunahle,</HI> by making a War pre&s;ently upon the <HI>Caimal,</HI> or Prince of <HI>Corngeira</HI> his Friend and Allie: and having with incredible expedition got an Army of 60000 Men together, he &s;ent to let the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI> know, that before he marched he de&s;igned to wait upon him. The <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop,</HI> tho' he did not go over his Thre&s;hold to meet the King, received him, when he came,

<P>The <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI> having put the Affairs of the Siege in a good po&s;ture, begun to apply him&s;elf to the reduction of the Chri&s;tians of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> and the fir&s;t &s;tep he made towards it, was to &s;end to the <HI>Arch-Deacon</HI> to come and &s;peak with him at <HI>Cochim.</HI> But after having expected him &s;ome days, and finding that he neither came him&s;elf, nor returned him any an&s;wer, he con|cluded, as well he might, that he was afraid to venture him&s;elf in that City; whereupon he &s;ent him a Letter of <HI>&s;afe Conduct,</HI> &s;wearing he would not que&s;tion him about any thing that was pa&s;t.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arch-Deacon,</HI> upon this occa&s;ion, A&s;&s;em|bled a great number of <HI>Ca&ccedil;anares,</HI> and other

<P>Upon all which Con&s;iderations it was agreed, That they &s;hould give way to his &s;aying of <HI>Ma&s;s,</HI> and his Preaching in their Churches, which their Books told them was a common Civility, that is every where paid to Bi&s;hops, tho' out of their own Dioce&s;&s;es; but as for any Acts of Juri&s;dicti|on, &s;uch as Vi&s;iting, Conferring Orders, Excom|municating, and the like, if he &s;hould pretend to exerci&s;e any &s;uch Acts, as it was to be feared he would, that they &s;hou'd then put him off as well as they cou'd with delays, until he returned to <HI>Goa,</HI> which they thought he would in two Months at farthe&s;t; by which means they might, without embroiling them&s;elves with &s;o powerful a Prelate, wait till they had a Bi&s;hop &s;ent them by the Patriarch of <HI>Babylon,</HI> to whom they had writ for one; of all which they made a pub|lick

<P>All this while no <HI>Arch-Deacon</HI> appeared, who came not to <HI>Vaipicotta,</HI> till two days after the arrival of the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop.</HI> He had delayed his coming on purpo&s;e, that he might not by his pre|&s;ence, &s;eem to con&s;ent to any of tho&s;e things, which he knew the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI> would offer to do at that place.</P>

<P>The Chri&s;tians of the Village, when they came to hear of what had been done, run, as if they had been Mad, in a Body to the <HI>Arch-Dea|con</HI>'s Lodgings, where, with one voice, they &s;et up a mo&s;t lamentable howl, crying out, <HI>That the Arch-Bi&s;hop of</HI> Goa, <HI>with his</HI> Portuguezes <HI>was come to de&s;troy their Religion, and had affronted their</HI> Patriarch, <HI>by whom they had been Governed for above</HI> 1200 <HI>Years;</HI> and after having exclaimed again&s;t the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI> at a mo&s;t bitter rate, and bewailed their great Mi&s;ery, in having Strangers come among them to de&s;troy the Religion they had been born and bred in, they told their <HI>Ca&s;&s;a|nares,</HI> that if they would but give way to it, they would either Sacrifice their Lives in defence of their Religion, or be revenged on tho&s;e that had affronted it.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Arch-Deacon</HI> having made a &s;ign, that he de&s;ired to be heard, they all held their Peace, he told them, <HI>There was a time for all things, and that that was not a time for Revenge, but Di&s;&s;imu|lation; that it was true he had Signed the Excom|munication, but that he did it purely out of Fear, for they were to con&s;ider, that, be&s;ides the Strength the</HI> Arch-Bi&s;hop <HI>had brought along with him, he had engaged the King of</HI> Cochim, <HI>in who&s;e Country they were, to protect him in all he did, and who, if they &s;hould offer any affront to the</HI> Arch-Bi&s;hop, <HI>would certainly revenge it on their Lives and E&s;tates.

<P>The <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI> was extreamly troubled at this News, as well upon the account of the great numbers of Per&s;ons of Quality that had been killed in the Action, as becau&s;e he feared it would very much hearten the Kings of <HI>Malabar,</HI> who had till then &s;till looked upon the <HI>Portuguezes</HI> as Invincible.

<P>The&s;e tricks of the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI> coming &s;o thick, one upon the neck of another, for here we have no fewer than three of them in le&s;s than a Fortnight, puts me in mind of what <HI>Manuel de Faria</HI> &s;aith of him in the <HI>3d.</HI> Tome of his <HI>A&s;ia Portugue&s;a,</HI> which I &s;hall give the Reader in his own words, <Q REND="margDblQuotes">E&s;te illu&s;tre Prelado e&s;tuviera yo por ventura en el numero de los &s;antos, &s;i no pa&s;&s;ara a E&s;panna a donde le quito e&s;ta gloria, en la opinion mortal, la deficil del acierto en el maneio de los grandes pue&s;tos que vinoa ocupar, o fue&s;&s;en &s;olicitudos, o fue&s;&s;en ofrecidos.</Q> <Q REND="italic">This Illu&s;trious Prelate, had he never returned to <HI>Spain,</HI> had, in all probability, been made a Saint before this time, where, thro' the difficulty there is in the managery of high Po&s;ts, whether offered to him or procured by Sollicitations, he lo&s;t all the Glory he had acquired in the <HI>Indies</HI> in the Opinion of the World.</Q></P>

<PB N="79" REF="51"> would Ordain both <HI>Latins</HI> and <HI>Chaldaeans,</HI> it be|ing his bu&s;ine&s;s to de&s;troy that di&s;tinction by bringing all Chri&s;tians under one head. Upon this the <HI>Arch-Deacon</HI> finding nothing el&s;e would do, ordered an Edict to be publi&s;hed in all the Churches of the Dioce&s;s, prohibiting all Chri&s;ti|ans, upon pain of Excommunication, <HI>latae &s;enten|tiae,</HI> to receive any Orders from him, with which he &s;ent another In&s;trument, commanding all Prie&s;ts and Chri&s;tian People not to &s;uffer him to come into any of their Churches, as al&s;o not to be pre&s;ent at any of his <HI>Ma&s;&s;es</HI> or <HI>Sermons.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI> had Preached two days fol|lowing, and had confirmed a great many before the&s;e In&s;truments had reached <HI>Diamper;</HI> but after they came once to be publi&s;hed, they put a full &s;top to what went on &s;o currently before: The olde&s;t <HI>Ca&ccedil;anar</HI> of the Church requiring the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop,</HI> upon the receipt of them, to leave the place, and not to offer to &s;et his Foot in their Church any more, nor to Confirm any Body, which among them, who anointed Children on the Head when they were Baptized, was an un|nece&s;&s;ary Ceremony.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this, the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI> continued &s;till a Preaching, and when the day appointed for the Ordination was come, Ordained 37 on it, having fir&s;t obliged them to &s;ub&s;cribe the Faith of <HI>Pius</HI> IV. and to &s;wear obedience to the Pope. After this Solemnity was over, the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI> determined to pa&s;s the <HI>Holy Week,</HI> and <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> at <HI>Carturte,</HI> a con&s;iderable Town of

<P>The <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI> not knowing but that the <HI>Por|tuguezes</HI> Mu&s;ick might charm the common People, and reconcile them to the <HI>Latin</HI> Service, to which they &s;eemed to have a great aver&s;ion, &s;ent for a full Quire from <HI>Cochim,</HI> and on <HI>Palm-Sunday</HI> had high <HI>Ma&s;s</HI> performed with the &s;ame Ceremony and Maje&s;ty that he could have had it done at <HI>Goa:</HI> but the <HI>Ca&ccedil;anares</HI> and People were &s;o far from being &s;atisfied with the Mu&s;ick and pompous Ceremony of that Service, that if they liked it ill before, they liked it a great deal wor&s;e after that, as in truth none but they that

<P>The Queen of <HI>Pimenta</HI> being importun'd to it by &s;everal Chri&s;tians, and her own Jealou&s;ies, &s;ent an Order to the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI> to leave her Kingdom in three days upon pain of Death, and not to trouble her Subjects with his <HI>Novelties,</HI> un|der which, &s;he had rea&s;on to apprehend &s;ome ill de&s;ign again&s;t her State was couched.

<P>What made the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI> the &s;touter in this occa&s;ion, was his knowing that he had &s;ecured mo&s;t of her <HI>Regedores,</HI> namely him of <HI>Carturte,</HI> and the Country about it to his Party, whom
<PB N="82" REF="53"> he had engaged by very rich Pre&s;ents to favour and protect him in the execution of his de&s;igns.

They all owned that His <HI>Grace</HI> had great rea&s;on to be angry with the <HI>Arch-Deacon;</HI> but yet &s;ee|ing he was but a young Man, and had had the ill luck to be in the hands of bad Coun&s;ellors, they intreated His <HI>Grace,</HI> before he declared his place void, to allow them &s;ome time to admoni&s;h him in, and to try whether they could not per|&s;wade him to Conformity; for which they de&s;i|red but twenty days, promi&s;ing, that if he did not &s;ubmit within the time, that they would never own him more, but would &s;ubmit to any

<P>On <HI>Ea&s;ter-Eve</HI> the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI> had a &s;econd Ordination, whereat he Ordained a great many that had been hindred by the <HI>Regedores</HI> from coming to the fir&s;t.

<P>On <HI>Ea&s;ter-day</HI> the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI> intended to have a mo&s;t &s;olemn <HI>Proce&s;&s;ion,</HI> which the <HI>Heathens</HI> having notice of, were re&s;olved either to hinder or di&s;turb it; but finding they were not &s;trong enough to do the former, by rea&s;on of the <HI>Re|gedore</HI>'s guarding the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI> as he did, they hired the mo&s;t infamous Sorcerer of the whole Country to kill the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI> in the <HI>Proce&s;&s;ion,</HI> which he undertook to do with a Charm that
<PB N="85" REF="54"> had never failed him, but as he begun to do his <HI>Tricks</HI> in the <HI>Proce&s;&s;ion,</HI> he was &s;eized on and &s;ent to Pri&s;on, and a Currier was immediately di&s;patched away to the Queen to acquaint her with what had been done: The Queen &s;traight|ways &s;ent back an Order, that he &s;hould be put on the <HI>Caloete,</HI> which is a &s;harp Stake fa&s;tned in the Ground, which being &s;tuck thorow the Body of the Malefactor, he dies thereon in great tor|ment. But the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI> would not give way to his being puni&s;hed &s;o, but condemned him to greater puni&s;hment, in &s;ending him to <HI>Cochim</HI> to Row in the Gallies as long as he lived, which &s;hews how great the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI>'s Power, how|ever he came by it, was at <HI>Carturte,</HI> where he made his fir&s;t great Conver&s;ion.</P>
<P>When the Morning-Service was over, the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI> was invited by the <HI>Ca&ccedil;anares</HI> to the <HI>Nercha,</HI> which is a Fea&s;t kept in the Church on certain days, all the Chri&s;tians that are pre&s;ent &s;itting down to it. The Bi&s;hop, if pre&s;ent, craves the Ble&s;&s;ing, and in his ab&s;ence, the elde&s;t Prie&s;t of the Church. The Bi&s;hop has one half of the Provi&s;ion, the Prie&s;ts a quarter, and the People a quarter among them. In many Churches there are certain Rents dedicated to the maintenance of tho&s;e Fea&s;ts, which &s;eem to be the &s;ame with the Apo&s;tolical <HI>Agapae</HI> or <HI>Love-Fea&s;ts,</HI> I do not know but St. <HI>Paul</HI> might allude to this double Portion that the Bi&s;hop has at the&s;e Fea&s;ts, when he &s;aith, <HI>That they who rule well, and labour in the Word and Doctrine, are
<PB N="86" REF="55"> worthy of double Honour;</HI> and the rather becau&s;e he immediately &s;ubjoyns, <HI>Thou &s;halt not muzzle the Ox that treadeth out the Corn,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>In the Evening the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI> went and vi|&s;ited all the Sick in the Town, and gave them both Money and Gho&s;tly Coun&s;el, the People imagining that this was the common Practice of all the <HI>Roman</HI> Prelates, began to cry them up to the Skies, as much more humble and charita|ble than the <HI>Chaldean</HI> Bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>On <HI>Ea&s;ter-Tue&s;day</HI> the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI> went out to <HI>Nagpili,</HI> a Church about a quarter of a League from <HI>Carturte,</HI> where having Preached, he confir|med a great many, and reconciled &s;everal <HI>Ca&ccedil;a|nares</HI> to the <HI>Roman</HI> Church.

<P>Next day the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI> &s;et Sail for <HI>Molan|durte,</HI> where, when he arrived, he found the People much changed from what they were, when he was there la&s;t, for they had &s;hut the Church doors again&s;t him, neither did there &s;o much as one &s;ingle Per&s;on appear to receive him at the place where he was to Land, which was a quarter of a League from the Town.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI> under&s;tanding how things were a&s;hoar, did not offer to Land for fear of rai&s;ing a Tumult, but wrote away immediately to the Governour of <HI>Cochim,</HI> to &s;end the King of <HI>Cochim</HI>'s chief <HI>Regedor</HI> to him before <HI>Mo|landurte.</HI> The King, tho' he did not love to hear of the Chri&s;tians of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> &s;ubmitting them|&s;elves to the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop,</HI> being very &s;en&s;ible, if they were once brought under <HI>Portugueze</HI> Bi&s;hops, it would not be long before they would be entirely under the Crown of <HI>Portugal</HI> too, by which means he &s;hould lo&s;e 50000 of the be&s;t Soldiers in his Kingdom; yet at the &s;ame time he appear|ed very zealous to promote that work, having more than once Commanded all his Chri&s;tian Subjects in all things to do what the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI> would have them, and accordingly when the Go|vernour &s;ent him word that the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI> de&s;i|red to &s;peak with the chief <HI>Regedor</HI> at <HI>Molandurte,</HI> he immediately ordered him to go and wait on him.</P>
<PB N="88" REF="56">
<P>When the <HI>Regedor</HI> was come, the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI> complained to him of the vexation his Ma&s;ter had given the Chri&s;tians of <HI>Molandurte,</HI> for no other rea&s;on but for the kind reception they had given him when he was there la&s;t. The <HI>Regedor</HI> endeavoured to palliate the matter, and promi&s;ed to acquaint his Ma&s;ter with what the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI> had told him, <HI>Who, if any thing were ami&s;s,</HI> he &s;aid, <HI>would be &s;ure to redre&s;s it, and to give his</HI> Grace <HI>&s;atisfaction.</HI> The <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI> here took him up &s;hort, and told him, <HI>That he ex|pected no kindne&s;s from his Ma&s;ter, &s;ince he had de|nied him &s;o &s;mall a favour, as to order the Mu&s;|quets that were lodged in the Quire of the Church, to be removed to a proper place, which, tho' he had faithfully promi&s;ed to do, yet he under&s;tood the Mu&s;|quets were there &s;till.</HI> The <HI>Regedor</HI> told him, <HI>The</HI> Regedor <HI>of the Place, and not his Ma&s;ter, was to blame for that, who, to his knowledge, was ordered to have done it.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI> and <HI>Regedor</HI> went to Church together, where the <HI>Regedor,</HI> in his hear|ing, commanded all the Chri&s;tians of the place, in the King's Name, to do what&s;oever the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI> &s;hould command them. But, tho' he is &s;aid, at the &s;ame time to have whi&s;pered &s;ome in the Ear, That the King would rather that they &s;hould adhere to their <HI>Arch-Deacon,</HI> and their old Cu&s;toms, than &s;ubmit to the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop,</HI> yet that did not appear in the &s;udden change that was wrought in their Carriage, by what the <HI>Regedor</HI> had told them publickly; for they

<P>The <HI>Regedor</HI> a&s;&s;ured him a &s;econd time, that his Ma&s;ter always had, and always would favour his de&s;igns in the <HI>Serra, I &s;hall quickly know that,</HI> &s;aid the Arch-Bi&s;hop, <HI>for if you be &s;incere, you will pre&s;ently call all the Chri&s;tians together, and Command them, in the King's Name to acknow|ledge me as their Prelate, and to unite them&s;elves to the Church of</HI> Rome. The <HI>Regedor</HI> promi&s;ed to do it pre&s;ently, and having called all the Chri&s;tians together, commanded them before the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI> on pain of the King's high di&s;plea&s;ure, to obey the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI> in all things, a&s;&s;uring them withal, that this was His Maje&s;ty's Will, and therefore they &s;hould give no credit to any that &s;hould whi&s;per the contrary to them; and thus, by Hectoring and Bribing of Kings and their <HI>Regedores,</HI> the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI> made both &s;udden and great Conver&s;ions.</P>
<P>Having di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the <HI>Regedor,</HI> the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI> gave them a Sermon, and commanded them to come to Church next Morning to be confirmed by him.

<PB N="91" REF="57"> and to blame the <HI>Arch-Deacon</HI> for his ob&s;tinacy.

<P>Before the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI> left <HI>Vaipicotta,</HI> the <HI>Caimal</HI> of <HI>Angamale,</HI> who was called the <HI>black King</HI> of <HI>Malabar,</HI> came to give him a vi&s;it: The <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI> received him kindly, and at parting pre|&s;ented him with &s;ome pieces of very rich Cloath;
<PB N="107" REF="65"> which was what he went well furni&s;hed withal from <HI>Goa,</HI> having laid out 18000 <HI>Pardaos</HI> in Goods, to make Pre&s;ents of in the <HI>Serra.</HI> The <HI>Caimal,</HI> who was a boi&s;terous and bloody Prince, was &s;o well plea&s;ed with his Pre&s;ent, that he pro|mi&s;ed the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI> to &s;ee him obeyed in all things.</P>

<P>What remained to be done, after having en|gaged all the Neighbouring Princes, and their <HI>Regedors</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, was to &s;ecure the <HI>Major</HI> Vote in the Synod; and in order thereunto he Ordained no fewer than fifty Prie&s;ts on <HI>Trinity-Sunday,</HI> in the Church of <HI>Paru,</HI> which fifty being added to the thirty eight he had Ordained but a little before at <HI>Diamper,</HI> and to tho&s;e he had Ordained at <HI>Carturte,</HI> who are &s;aid to have been many, mu&s;t make up at lea&s;t two thirds of the Prie&s;ts that were pre&s;ent at the Synod, who in all were but 153. of which two thirds the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI> was &s;ecure, having before he Or|dained them, made them abjure their old Reli|gion, and &s;ub&s;cribe the Creed of <HI>Pius</HI> IV.</P>

<PB N="108" REF="66"> the <HI>Procurators,</HI> by making them great Pre&s;ents, giving to one of them a Cro&s;s &s;et with <HI>Diamonds</HI> of great value, as he did another of equal price, to an old <HI>Ca&ccedil;anar,</HI> who had been a great Com|panion of Arch-Bi&s;hop <HI>Mar Abraham.</HI> Upon which, and the other Precautions made u&s;e of by the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI> to compa&s;s his ends in the Synod, Father <HI>Simon</HI> in his 109 Pag. of his <HI>Hi&s;torie Critique,</HI> makes the following judicious reflection: <HI>All that the&s;e methods have hitherto produced, &s;erves only to let the World &s;ee by what means the</HI> Roman <HI>Religion has been e&s;tabli&s;hed in the</HI> Ea&s;t, <HI>which he that knows will not wonder, that all the re-unions which have been made with tho&s;e People we call</HI> Schi&s;maticks <HI>in tho&s;e Parts, have been &s;o &s;hort lived.</HI></P>
<P>On the 9th. of <HI>June</HI> the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI> accompa|nied with &s;ix <HI>Je&s;uites</HI> and his Confe&s;&s;or, who were all Divines, and &s;everal <HI>Ca&ccedil;anares,</HI> arrived at <HI>Diamper,</HI> where he immediately erected a <HI>Junto</HI> of eight of the mo&s;t popular <HI>Ca&ccedil;anares,</HI> before whom he laid the Decrees, de&s;iring their opini|on of them; and when they came to con&s;ider the Decrees relating to manners, he called four of the grave&s;t of the <HI>Procurators</HI> al&s;o to be pre&s;ent at the Examination of them; after &s;ome Debates the Decrees were all agreed to by the <HI>Junto,</HI> which, for that rea&s;on, was given out to be the Author of them.</P>
<P>On the 20th. of <HI>June</HI> 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">99. the Synod was opened, at which &s;olemnity were pre&s;ent the <HI>Dean</HI> and <HI>Chapter</HI> of <HI>Cochim,</HI> with their whole <HI>Quire,</HI> as al&s;o the Governour, the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the

<P>I will detain the Reader no longer from the peru&s;al of the Synod it &s;elf, in which he is not to wonder if he meets with the whole ma&s;s of <HI>Popery,</HI> con&s;idering that all its Decrees were com|po&s;ed by a Popi&s;h <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI> who a&s;&s;embled it on purpo&s;e to e&s;tabli&s;h the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion in the <HI>Serra;</HI> in the doing whereof, tho' he was in|&s;trumental in letting the World know more of the Orthodoxy of that Apo&s;tolical Church, than its like they would ever have known of it other|wi&s;e, we have rea&s;on to ble&s;s Providence, but none at all to thank him for it, who intended nothing le&s;s than the making of &s;uch a happy di&s;|covery.</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Synod is printed at the end of the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Dom Frey Aleixo de Menezes,</HI> Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Goa</HI>'s Vi&s;itation of the Chri&s;tians of Saint <HI>Thomas</HI> in the <HI>Serra</HI> or Mountain of <HI>Malabar,</HI> made immediately after the Celebration, and in pur&s;uance of the Order of the &s;aid Sy|nod; the Hi&s;tory of which Vi&s;itation was compos'd by <HI>Antonio de Gouvea,</HI> an <HI>Au&s;tin Friar,</HI> and Reader of Divinity in <HI>Goa,</HI> at the Command of the Provincial of his Order in <HI>Portugal.</HI> It contains divers things that are fit for all Prote&s;tants to know; namely, the rude and boi&s;terous Methods, that the <HI>Roman</HI> Prelates, where they may do it with &s;afety, make u&s;e of in the Reduction of tho&s;e
<PB REF="69"> they call <HI>Hereticks;</HI> together with clear Con|firmations of the Truth of what we meet with in the Fourteenth, and other Decrees of the Third Action of this Synod; to wit, That the Three great Doctrines of Popery, the <HI>Pope</HI>'s <HI>Supremacy, Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation,</HI> the <HI>Adoration of Images,</HI> were never believed nor practi&s;ed at any time in this ancient Apo|&s;tolical Church; but, on the contrary, were rejected and condemned by her, and that in her Publick Offices. So that upon what we learn from this Synod and Hi&s;tory, I think one may venture to &s;ay, That before the time of the late Reformation, there was no Church that we know of, no not that of the <HI>Vaudois,</HI> abating that one thing of her being infected with the Here&s;ie of <HI>Ne&s;torius,</HI> of which too &s;he is cleared by one of the <HI>Roman</HI> Communion, that had &s;o Few Er|rors in Doctrine, as the Church of <HI>Ma|labar.</HI></P>
<P>If the Synod I here publi&s;h &s;hould be well received, as I have rea&s;on to hope it will, by all Prote&s;tants, and lovers of Truth, upon the account of the clear Di&s;coveries
<PB REF="69"> it makes of the forementioned Popi&s;h Er|rors, having never been at any time the Doctrines of the Univer&s;al Church, which we know is confidently affirmed, and much boa&s;ted of; and for further &s;atisfaction in &s;o important a Matter, the above-named Hi&s;tory &s;hould be de&s;ired, I &s;hall be rea|dy to tran&s;late and publi&s;h it with all ex|pedition, alone, and in the &s;ame Volume with this of the Synod; together with the be&s;t Account I can procure of the Church of <HI>Malabar,</HI> and the other Oriental Churches, that were never within the Bounds of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire; for it is in tho&s;e Churches that we are to expect to meet with the lea&s;t of the Leaven of Popery.</P>
<P>As to the Synod, to prevent all &s;urmi&s;es of its being a Piece either forged by &s;ome Prote&s;tant, or of no Authority in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> tho' &s;et forth by a Member of her Communion; I have, together with the whole Title Page, which tells where, when, and by whom it was printed, tran&s;lated and publi&s;hed all the <HI>Licences</HI> that it came out with: And if any &s;hould &s;u&s;pect the Tran&s;|lation,
<PB REF="70"> if they plea&s;e, they may &s;atisfie them|&s;elves of its Fidelity, by having recour&s;e to the Original in the <HI>Bodleian Library</HI> at <HI>Ox|ford;</HI> to which, as the &s;afe&s;t, as well as no|ble&s;t Repo&s;itory of Books in the World, I de&s;ign to give it.</P>
<P>I have here and there added &s;ome &s;hort Remarks upon &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages, which will not, I hope, be unacceptable to the Rea|der.</P>

<P>But perceiving that our Mandate in that behalf had no effect, what we had ordered, not having been obeyed in the &s;aid Dioce&s;s, &s;o that what our mo&s;t Holy Father, the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Rome,</HI> had de&s;igned, was like to be fru&s;trated, after having laboured therein for the &s;pace of two Years, Schi&s;m and Di&s;obedience to

<P>BUt the forementioned Here&s;ies are not only to be met with in the&s;e Books, but are like|wi&s;e in the Common Prayer, and Breviaries that they u&s;e in their Churches, which having been compo&s;ed by <HI>Ne&s;torian</HI> Hereticks, are full of Bla&s;phemies, Here&s;ies, Fables, and Apocry|phal &s;tories, whereby in&s;tead of prai&s;ing God, they are continually bla&s;pheming him in their Divine Offices.</P>
<P>In the Book called the <HI>Great Breviary,</HI> it is &s;aid, That the Divine Word did not a&s;&s;ume Fle&s;h, ignorantly pretending to prove it thus; becau&s;e if the Word had a&s;&s;umed Fle&s;h, to what purpo&s;e was the Holy Spirit's over&s;hadowing the Virgin?

<PB N="168" REF="112"> him continually only the Temple of God; and in the Fea&s;t of the Nativity, there is a propo&s;i|tion in one of the &s;olemn Antiphona's, that di|rectly contradicts St. <HI>John,</HI> in which it is &s;aid, that <HI>the Word was not made Fle&s;h,</HI> and that all that be|lieve the contrary, are di&s;obedient to the Church, and are ob&s;tinate Rebels again&s;t the Faith; &s;o that the whole Offices of the Advent and Nativi|ty are little el&s;e than pure Bla&s;phemy.</P>

<P>THe Fourth Sacrament is that of <HI>Penance,</HI> in which the Acts of the Penitent are, as it were, the Matter, and are di&s;tingui&s;hed into the&s;e three parts, <HI>Contrition of Heart, Confe&s;&s;ion of the Mouth,</HI> and <HI>Satisfaction for Sins, according to the direction of the Confe&s;&s;or.</HI> It belongs to the <HI>Con|trition of the heart,</HI> that the Penitent be &s;orry at his Soul for the Sins that he has committed, and dete&s;ting them, is firmly re&s;olved not to com|mit them any more: which <HI>Contrition,</HI> tho' it &s;ometimes happen to be perfect through Charity, &s;o as to reconcile one to God even before he has actually received the Sacrament of <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion,</HI> yet it can never be perfect, nor a means of reconci|liation with God, if not attended with a readi|ne&s;s and purpo&s;e of mind to confe&s;s tho&s;e very &s;ins which it is conver&s;ant about; &s;uch &s;ins be|ing no le&s;s &s;ubject than others, to the Keys and the ingagements to <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion.</HI> It belongs to the <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion of the mouth,</HI> that the Penitent Confe&s;s him&s;elf entirely to his own Prie&s;t, as to all the &s;ins that he remembers, u&s;ing all due diligence according to the length of the time, &s;ince he la&s;t Confe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf; and this <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion</HI> is not to be only of &s;ins in general, nor only of the
<PB N="262" REF="159"> <HI>Species</HI> of them, but of every &s;in in particular, and as far as the Penitent is able to remember of their number; declaring withal, all the ag|gravating Circum&s;tances, and all &s;uch as change the <HI>Species;</HI> in a word, all <HI>mortal</HI> &s;ins, how &s;e|cret &s;oever, tho' only in thoughts and wicked de&s;ires; as al&s;o all faults committed again&s;t the two la&s;t Commandments; <HI>Thou &s;halt not covet thy Neighbours Wife; Thou &s;halt not covet any thing that is anothers;</HI> &s;uch &s;ins being at &s;ome times more dangerous for the Soul, than others that are open; all which we are commanded to do by the Divine Law; our Saviour when he a&s;cended into Heaven, leaving the Prie&s;ts for his Vicars upon Earth, and con&s;tituting them Judges, before whom all <HI>mortal</HI> &s;ins committed by Chri&s;tians, were to be brought, that by the power of the Keys, which he committed to them to forgive or retain &s;ins, they may pronounce Sentence, which cannot be ju&s;t and Righteous, neither can the puni&s;hments they impo&s;e be e|qual or proportionated to the Nature of the Faults, without their having a full knowledge of the &s;ame, as of the matter that they pa&s;s Sentence upon; which knowledge cannot be had but by the Penitents confe&s;&s;ing all and every <HI>Mortal</HI> Sin, whereon Judgment is to pa&s;s, not only in gene|ral, but in <HI>&s;pecie</HI> and number, making mention of every &s;uch Sin in particular, with all its ne|ce&s;&s;ary circum&s;tances, that &s;o a ju&s;t &s;entence o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> ab&s;olution or retention may be pronounced up|on them. And as to <HI>Venial</HI> Sins which we fre|quently
<PB N="263" REF="159"> fall into, and for which we are not ex|cluded from the Grace of God, tho' the confe&s;|&s;ing of, and being ab&s;olved from them, is very profitable to the Soul, yet we are not under any &s;uch preci&s;e obligation of confe&s;&s;ing them, there being other ways by which they may be pardoned, &s;o that it is no &s;in not to di&s;cover them. The third part of <HI>Penitence,</HI> is, <HI>Satisfa|ction for Sins according to the judgment of the Con|fe&s;&s;or;</HI> which <HI>&s;atisfaction</HI> is chiefly performed by Prayer, Fa&s;ting and Alms, the Penitent being obliged to comply with the Penance impo&s;ed upon him by the Prie&s;t, who being as a Judge in the place of God, ought to impo&s;e what he thinks to be nece&s;&s;ary, not only with re&s;pect to the amendment of Sin for the future, but chief|ly with re&s;pect to the <HI>Satisfaction</HI> and <HI>Penance</HI> of pa&s;t Sins. The Form of this Sacrament is, <HI>I ab&s;olve thee,</HI> to which nece&s;&s;ary words the Church has thought fit to add the words following, <HI>from all thy Sins, in the Name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> There are al&s;o &s;ome Pray|ers which the Prie&s;t &s;aith immediately after o|ver the Penitent, which, tho' they are not e&s;|&s;ential to the form, yet are very profitable and healthful for the Penitent. Now by pronouncing the form, not only all the Sins that are confe&s;|&s;ed, but all tho&s;e likewi&s;e which after a due di|ligence and Examination of the Con&s;cience do not occurr to the Memory, &s;o as to be di&s;cover|ed, all &s;uch being included in the &s;aid Confe&s;&s;i|on, are all pardoned; tho' with an obligation of
<PB N="264" REF="160"> confe&s;&s;ing them, if they &s;hould ever after come to be remembred, &s;ins being as it were chains to the Soul, from which it is delivered by the ab&s;olution of the Prie&s;t, which is applicable to &s;uch, as by virtue of contrition joyned with a de&s;ire of confe&s;&s;ing, have obtained pardon of God for their Sins, which they were under an obli|gation to have confe&s;&s;ed: as al&s;o to tho&s;e Sins which were never confe&s;&s;ed, becau&s;e not re|membred after a due diligence, and to tho&s;e likewi&s;e which having been once lawfully con|fe&s;&s;ed and truly pardoned, are by the Penitent of his own accord, and for the greater Penance confe&s;&s;ed and &s;ubmitted to the Keys &s;everal times. The Mini&s;ter of this Sacrament is a Prie&s;t, <HI>who hath Authority to ab&s;olve,</HI> and is either the <HI>Or|dinary,</HI> as the Prelates, or &s;uch as are commi&s;&s;ion|ed and approved of by them.

<HEAD>The Doctrine of the Sacrament of <HI>Order.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe &s;ixth Sacrament is that of <HI>Order,</HI> which was in&s;tituted by our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t the day before he &s;uffered for us, after that he had made an end of in&s;tituting the Sacrament of the Euchari&s;t, that &s;o he might in&s;titute the Sacrifice and the Prie&s;ts that were to offer it together; at which time he created the Apo&s;tles Prie&s;ts, giving them withal power to con&s;ecrate others, that &s;o the Sacrifice and the Prie&s;thood might be continued in the Church till the end of the World. The Matter of this Sacrament is that which is delivered to the Per&s;on that is ordained, for the exerci&s;e of that Order he has received; to the Prie&s;ts, a Cup with Wine in it, and a Patten with Bread; to a Deacon the Book of the Go&s;pels; and to a Sub-Deacon an empty Cup and Patten, and &s;o as to the other inferiour Orders: The Form of the Prie&s;thood and other Orders, are the words &s;poke by the Bi&s;hop when he
<PB N="289" REF="172"> delivers to every one that which belongs to his Mini&s;try and the exerci&s;e of his Order. The Mini&s;ter of this Sacrament is only a Bi&s;hop, to whom only Chri&s;t committed the power of Con&s;ecrating Prie&s;ts; the effect of it is the en|crea&s;e of Grace, to the end that the Per&s;on or|dained may be a fit Mini&s;ter. This Sacrament was in&s;tituted by Chri&s;t as highly nece&s;&s;ary in his Church; for a Sacrifice and Prie&s;thood are &s;o join|ed, that the one cannot be without the other; wherefore &s;ince under the New Te&s;tament the vi&s;ible. Sacrifice of the Holy <HI>Euchari&s;t</HI> was to be in&s;tituted, it became therefore nece&s;&s;ary, that there &s;hould be a new, vi&s;ible and eternal Prie&s;t|hood in the &s;ame Church, whereby the ancient Prie&s;thood of the Old Law was tran&s;lated; and there were Prie&s;ts provided accordingly for the Offering of the Divine Sacrifice; which Prie&s;ts be|ing lawfully ordained, our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t has given them power over his true and real Body, to Con&s;ecrate, Offer, and Admini&s;ter it, as al&s;o o|ver his My&s;tical Body the Church; giving them power to pardon and retain Sins; to which power <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">t likewi&s;e belongs to rule and govern all Chri|&s;tian People, and to lead them in the way to Eternal Life. Now the Prie&s;thood being &s;o high an Office, that it may be exerci&s;ed with the more decency and veneration, it was conveni|ent that there &s;hould be different Orders or Mini&s;ters, who are bound by their Function to &s;erve the Prie&s;thood, and to be divided in &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> manner, that after having received the <HI>Clerical

<P>THe &s;eventh Sacrament is that of <HI>Matrimo|mony,</HI> which according to the Apo&s;tle is the &s;ignification of that Union which is betwixt Chri&s;t and his Church. The efficient Cau&s;e of Matrimony regularly, is the Con&s;ent of both par|ties declared by Words or Signs <HI>de prae&s;enti.</HI> This Sacrament our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t Founded on the Matrimonial Contract, which has always been in the World, and in all Religions, from whence it is that Matrimony is to be con&s;idered in two re&s;pects; either as a Natural Contract, or as a Sacrament in&s;tituted by our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t: The Bond of Matrimony God hath made to be perpetual, in&s;omuch that it cannot be di&s;&s;olved by any thing but Death, according to what Chri&s;t &s;aid, <HI>Whom God hath joined let no Man put a&s;under;</HI> which is al&s;o in it &s;elf very con|venient. As it is a Sacrament, there is Grace re|ceived therein, as in other Sacraments, our Lord Chri&s;t, who was the Author and In&s;titutor of the Divine Sacraments, having by his Pa&s;&s;ion merited Grace for us, whereby the Natural Love which is betwixt the Married couple is perfect|ed, and the conjunction that is betwixt them is
<PB N="318" REF="187"> confirmed, and made Perpetual, and the Hu&s;|band and Wife are Sanctified. There are two Rea&s;ons or Ends for which Matrimony was or|dained and in&s;tituted; the fir&s;t and principal is the Procreation or Generation of Children, for the con&s;ervation of the World, and the multi|plication of the Faithful, and Servants of God. The &s;econd is, for a remedy for Uncleanne&s;s; and that &s;uch as are inclined to that Vice, might have a remedy given them by God, &s;o that li|ving with their Wives, they might not fall into that Sin, from whence it is that People may not only Marry once, but as often as one of the Parties dies, becau&s;e this end of Matrimony may not only be compa&s;&s;ed in the fir&s;t, but equally in the &s;ub&s;equent Marriages; wherefore the Church dete&s;ts tho&s;e as Hereticks, who condemn &s;econd Marriages, holding them to be unlawful; as &s;ome Hereticks did anciently; and as &s;ome of the mo&s;t Super&s;titious Heathens do at this day in the&s;e Parts; from whence it may al&s;o be collected, that this Sacrament may not only be lawfully ce|lebrated betwixt Per&s;ons capable of having Chil|dren, but al&s;o betwixt tho&s;e, who according to the ordinary cour&s;e of Nature, cannot have any, becau&s;e the &s;econd end may be an&s;wered in &s;uch Marriages; but where neither the one nor the other end can be an&s;wered, as in Children, for whom the Church has &s;et a certain time, and in &s;uch as are under a Natural Impotency that will la&s;t as long as they live, as to Matrimonial Acts, Matrimony is not to be celebrated: And
<PB N="319" REF="187"> tho' both under the Law of Nature and of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> there were Di&s;pen&s;ations whereby Matri|mony was made to deviate from its fir&s;t Origi|nal, &s;ome of the Patriarchs having had &s;everal Wives at once by a Divine Di&s;pen&s;ation, and the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> having permitted Divorces, or the repudiating of Wives, yet under the Evan|gelical Law, by which Matrimony was perfected and re&s;tored again to its fir&s;t E&s;tate and Purity, it is prohibited for a Man to have more than one Wife at a time, and to turn away his Wife and take another &s;o long as &s;he lives. The Be|nefits of Marriage are three principally; the fir&s;t is the Generation and Education of Chil|dren for the Wor&s;hip and Service of the true God; the &s;econd is the Fidelity which the Mar|ried couple ought to keep to one another; and the third is the Perpetuity of Matrimony, which, in that it cannot be di&s;&s;olved, &s;ignifies that in|&s;eparable Conjunction and Union that is betwixt Chri&s;t and his Church: And notwith&s;tanding for the cau&s;e of Fornication or Adultery, it is law|ful for the Married couple to part as to Coha|bitation, yet it is not lawful to Marry with any other, becau&s;e the Bond of Matrimony, being once lawfully tied, is Perpetual, and cannot be di&s;&s;olved by any thing but the death of one of the Parties.</P>

<PB N="441" REF="248"> wanting to our Duty in the&s;e Matters, it did not proceed from any Ob&s;tinacy of Mind, or from any Inclination we had to be Hereticks, or Schi&s;maticks, but purely for want of the Light of true Doctrine and healthful and Catholick Food, which was not given us by our Pre|lates, but who did in&s;tead thereof, poy&s;on us with the fal&s;e Doctrines of <HI>Ne&s;torius,</HI> and &s;everal other Errors; from which we are now, by the Divine Mercy, re&s;cued; and by the goodne&s;s of God, and the Mini&s;try of our <HI>Metropolitan,</HI> enlightened: from whence al&s;o ro&s;e the Rebellion which was made by us, when the Truth began to be fir&s;t preached to us; as al&s;o all the Troubles and Vex|ations that we gave to our <HI>Metropolitan,</HI> and the manife&s;t Dangers we expo&s;ed him to; for all which we are now heartily &s;orry, and do dayly more and more lament it: But whereas God has been plea|&s;ed to enlighten us with his Doctrine, the <HI>Metro|politan</HI> being di&s;couraged by none of tho&s;e things to go on preaching in our Churches, the light of the Truth coming to us by that means, we have cordially embraced, and have with an unanimous con&s;ent and great alacrity, made profe&s;&s;ion thereof in this Synod; having al&s;o put the Affairs of our Church in the be&s;t Order we were able, and &s;ub|mitting our &s;elves to the Judgment of our <HI>Metro|politan Mar Aleixo,</HI> who as our Ma&s;ter, has in&s;tructed us in all things: But whereas his Lord|&s;hip, after his Vi&s;itation of this Dioce&s;s is over, is to go to re&s;ide in his<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Own Dioce&s;s.]</HI> The Arch-Bi&s;hop cured them of the&s;e fears, for &s;ome time at lea&s;t, at the end of his Vi&s;itation, when he made a &s;olemn renunciation of the Arch-Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>God,</HI> and as &s;olemn an acceptation of that of the <HI>Serra,</HI> and that judi|cially and in Form; de&s;iring the Chri&s;tians of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> to whom he delivered both tho&s;e In&s;tru|ments, to &s;ollicite the Pope and King of <HI>Spain</HI> to give way to the Tran&s;lation; and promi&s;ing with|al to employ all his own intere&s;t in both to per&s;wade them to it; but it &s;eems all would not do, for the next News we hear of him, is, That in&s;tead of being gratified with the Arch-Bi&s;hoprick of the <HI>Serra,</HI> he was condemned to be Governour-General of the <HI>In|dies</HI> for three Years, and after that tran&s;lated to the Primacy of <HI>Portugal.</HI></NOTE> own Dioce&s;s, which we

</HEADNOTE>
<P>AMong the other things which the mo&s;t Reverend Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Goa,</HI> and Primate of the <HI>Indies, Dom Frey Aleixo de Menezes,</HI> put in Order in the <HI>Dioce&s;an</HI> Synod, a&s;&s;embled by him in the Bi&s;hop|rick of <HI>Angamale</HI> of the <HI>Serra</HI> of <HI>Malabar,</HI>
<PB REF="250"> of the Chri&s;tians of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> in which he purged the Church of the <HI>Ne&s;torian</HI> Here&s;ies, and reduced it to the Obedience of the Holy <HI>Roman</HI> Church; one of the chief was the reforming the <HI>Syrian</HI> Ma&s;s, which was &s;aid in the <HI>Chaldee</HI> Tongue in this Bi&s;hoprick, which having been com|po&s;ed or inlarged by <HI>Ne&s;torian</HI> Hereticks, was full of Errors and Bla&s;phemies both in the Prayers and Commemorations of <HI>Ne&s;torius, Theodorus,</HI> and <HI>Diodorus,</HI> and &s;e|veral other <HI>Ne&s;torian</HI> Hereticks, to whom as to Saints, they prayed, for to intercede for them: And whereas this People was in a profound Ignorance, nay the very Bi&s;hops, who came from <HI>Babylon,</HI> not knowing the true Form of Con&s;ecration, all of them adding to it and taking from it at their plea&s;ure; there being no certain particular Form of Con&s;ecration among them, un|til a certain Arch-Bi&s;hop came who had more knowledge than the re&s;t in Eccle|&s;ia&s;tical Matters, and the Holy Scriptures; who perceiving that the Form wherewith they Con&s;ecrated, contained in it &s;ome
<PB REF="251"> Errors, contrary to the Truth of the Di|vine Sacrament, did e&s;tabli&s;h the true Form, adding &s;ome words to it, both in the Con&s;ecration of the Body and Blood, in contradiction to the Error and Here&s;ie of tho&s;e who &s;ay that the Sacrament is <HI>only the Figure of the Body of Chri&s;t our Lord.</HI> From whence it is more than probable, the Hereticks of our Times, the revivers of the Errors of all the ancient condem|ned Sects, took this Opinion: The Form e&s;tabli&s;hed by the forementioned Arch-Bi|&s;hop, was, <HI>This is in truth my Body; this is in truth the Cup of my Blood, which was &s;hed for you and for many, for the propitia|tion and remi&s;&s;ion of your Sins; and this &s;hall be a Pledge to you for ever and ever;</HI> in which Form they have now Con&s;ecrated for &s;everal Years. But the mo&s;t Reve|rend Arch-Bi&s;hop Primate, having remo|ved the words that are not nece&s;&s;ary, e|&s;tabli&s;hed the proper Form u&s;ed in the Catholick Church, as it is in the <HI>Roman Mi&s;&s;al,</HI> laying a&s;ide divers and Sacrilegious and ignorant Ceremonies al&s;o, which &s;ig|nified
<PB REF="251"> &s;ome Here&s;ies and Errors that were among&s;t them: And having thus refor|med their <HI>Ma&s;s,</HI> he continued it however in its ancient Form, until &s;uch time as he had con&s;ulted the Apo&s;tolical <HI>See</HI> about it, to know what our Lord the Pope would determine in that Matter; many of the emendations are noted in the Synod, <HI>Dec.</HI> 10. <HI>Act.</HI> 5. of the Holy Sacrifice of the Ma&s;s, and in the Action of Matters of Faith, where they are to be &s;een; I &s;hall here pre&s;ent the Curious only with the <HI>Ma&s;s</HI> re|formed, and as its &s;aid among them at this time.</P>
