<HEAD>THE THEATER OF IAPONIA'S CONSTANCY.</HEAD>
<P>_THE cau&s;e of the en&s;uing &s;o &s;trange and cruell Martyrdomes, &s;uch as were neuer heard of in the Kingdom of <HI>Iaponia,</HI> &s;ince the Per&s;ecution a|gain&s;t the Chri&s;tians there began, was this as followeth.</P>
<P>Whereas the Emperour of <HI>Iaponia</HI> &s;ome yeares pa&s;t, had forbidden, by Proclamation throughout all the Prouinces of that Kingdome, vpo~ paine of death, that no Sayler or Mariner &s;hould bring any Chri&s;tian Religious man into <HI>Iaponia;</HI> which was a thing very ea&s;y to be done, in regard that <HI>Manila</HI> the chiefe Cit|ty of the <HI>Philippine</HI> Ilands is &s;o neare, and where there is &s;o great trafficke betweene the <HI>Spanyards</HI> and <HI>Iapo|nians:</HI> Notwith&s;tanding &s;ome there were both Chri|&s;tians, and Catholike Marriners, who &s;tyrred vp with zeale of Gods Honour, not regarding the threats and penaltyes of the lawes, did bring at &s;undry tymes from <HI>Manila</HI> into <HI>Iaponia,</HI> many Religious men, in
<PB N="4" REF="3"> &s;ecular apparell, to cultiuate and manure that new-planted Vineyard of this new-found Chri&s;tendome.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the &s;ayd Marriners there was one more famous the~ the re&s;t, Captayne of a &s;hip, called <HI>Ioachim,</HI> who as he &s;ayled from <HI>Manila</HI> towards <HI>Iaponia,</HI> car|ried with him two very Reuerend Religious men, the one wherof was called Father <HI>Pedro de Zuniga</HI> of the Order of <HI>S. Au&s;ten,</HI> and the other, Father <HI>Lewis de Flores</HI> of the Order of <HI>S. Dominicke,</HI> whome he could not tran&s;port &s;o &s;ecretly, but they were betrayed by certayne <HI>Hollande s,</HI> who euen vpo~ the very &s;hoare of <HI>Iaponia,</HI> inuaded and robbed <HI>Ioachims</HI> &s;hip, and al&s;o ac|cu&s;ed him before the Emperours Officers, for brin|ging the &s;ayd Religious men with him into <HI>Iaponia,</HI> contrary to the Emperours Proclamation: And for this cau&s;e was <HI>Ioachim</HI> pre&s;ently ca&s;t into pri&s;on at <HI>Fi|randum,</HI> togeather with the &s;ayd two Fathers, and all the other Marriners that were Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>There was at that tyme in the &s;ame Citty re&s;i|ding another Religious ma~ of the order of <HI>S. Dominick</HI> who went about to deliuer the fore&s;ayd Father <HI>Lewis</HI> out of pri&s;on; which indeed he had almo&s;t effected, to|geather with the deliuery of many more Chri&s;tians that were in the &s;ame Pri&s;on; but becau&s;e he could not breake open the pri&s;on doores without great noy&s;e, nor bring to pa&s;&s;e what he had determined, with that &s;ecrecy he de&s;ired, his plot was &s;oone di&s;couered, and all the Pri&s;oners brought backe againe into pri&s;on.</P>
<P>When the Emperour heard of this, he tooke the matter &s;o heynou&s;ly, and was &s;o inraged again&s;t the Chri&s;tians, a&s;well in regard of the new comming of
<PB N="5" REF="3"> tho&s;e Religious men into his Kingdome, to preach the Chri&s;tian fayth, as al&s;o, becau&s;e they had broken his Maie&s;ties pri&s;on; that without delay, he comma~|ded the Gouernour of <HI>Nanga&s;achi</HI> pre&s;e~tly to repayre to <HI>Firandum,</HI> and there put to death fir&s;t of all <HI>Ioachim</HI> the Captayne, and afterwards the two Religious men that he brought with him, as al&s;o all the other Marriners, that were Chri&s;tians. Moreouer he com|manded, that all other Religious men, whether they were of <HI>Europe,</HI> or of <HI>Iaponia</HI> who were impri&s;oned in diuers Cittyes &s;hould be put to death. And the like pu|ni&s;hment he charged to be inflicted vpon all Widows, and Orphanes, who&s;e Husbands, or Parents had in the former Per&s;ecution of late yeares, &s;uffered death for the fayth of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>The Gouernour with all &s;peed, at the Empe|rours commaundment, came to <HI>Firandum,</HI> where cal|ling for the pri&s;oners, he began to examine and aske them many que&s;tions; as, whether they were Chri|&s;tians? From whence they came? Of what Nation they were? And when, and where they were bapti|zed? Nor he did forget, now and then to exhort them to renounce their Fayth, promi&s;ing them their liues, if they would &s;o do; &amp; affirming that he had full power and Commi&s;&s;io~ from the Emperour, for what he promi&s;ed.</P>
<P>But to this la&s;t, one and the &s;elfe &s;ame mo&s;t con|&s;tant Reply was made by all; That nothing in the world &s;hould cau&s;e them deny their fayth, nor breake the promi&s;e they had made to IESVS CHRIST in Bap|ti&s;me. Vpon which an&s;were and firme re&s;olution, the
<PB N="6" REF="4"> Gouernour pre&s;ently pronounced &s;entence, and con|demned the Captayne <HI>Ioachim,</HI> and the two Religious Fathers <HI>Pedro de Zuniga</HI> the <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> Friar, and Father <HI>Lewis de Flores</HI> the Dominican, to be burned aliue, &amp; the re&s;t of the Marriners, who were twelue in number, to be beheaded.</P>
<P>Now the&s;e holy Confe&s;&s;ours of IESVS CHRIST hauing receaued this doom, the more to increa&s;e their ioy and a&s;&s;urance of dying for Chri&s;ts &s;ake, demanded of the Gouernour, for what cau&s;e he adiudged them to death? And they receiued this an&s;were in very plaine tearmes: to wit, that the Religious men mu&s;t dye, becau&s;e they had again&s;t the Emperours decree, entred into <HI>Iaponia</HI> to preach the law of Chri&s;t; and the re&s;t for that they had brought the &s;aid Preachers into the Countrey to that end. Which plaine declara|tion was an exceeding ioy and Iubily of heart vnto them all, when they &s;aw them&s;elues condemned to death for the fayth, and loue of IESVS CHRIST.</P>
<P>The place appointed for the execution, was out of the Citty of <HI>Firandum,</HI> where there was a faire and large plot of ground, like vnto an Amphitheater, all inclo&s;ed round with woodden rayles. Hither were the holy Co~fe&s;&s;ours brought forth of the Citty, with infinite multitudes of people, and the three foremo&s;t placed ech one at a pillar, or &s;take, whereunto they were bound, with great aboundance of fagots, and wood layd round about them. But before the fire was kindled, the other twelue Marriners heads were &s;troke~ off within the fore&s;aid place, before the eyes of the Holy Confe&s;&s;ours, that &s;tood now ready at the &s;take
<PB N="7" REF="4"> to be burned.</P>
<P>Heere now the good Captayne <HI>Ioachim</HI> made knowne the force of Chri&s;tian Eloquence, being not only permitted, but al&s;o commanded by the &s;ayd two Religious Fathers his Companions (who by rea&s;on of the &s;hort tyme of their abode in <HI>Iaponia,</HI> had not yet learned the language of that countrey) to profe&s;&s;e the fayth of Chri&s;t in the name of all the re&s;t. Of whome, &s;uch as did both &s;ee and heare him, do affirme, that he &s;eemed rather to &s;peake like an Apo&s;tle, then an ordi|nary Preacher, much le&s;&s;e a poore Marriner; &s;uch was the feruour, &s;uch the courage wherewith he preached IESVS CHRIST, in the very midde&s;t of the fyre and &s;moke. And by how much more the barbarous Gen|tils endeauoured a&s;well by often interrupting him, as by threats, to make him hold his peace; &s;o much the more did he cry out, and &s;ay, that it was meet he &s;hould rather obey God then Man. Neyther, can I be terri|fied (&s;ayd he) by your threatninges: for what more cruell, or more grieuous torment can you deui&s;e, then that which I now indure in burning heere aliue? And this he &s;aid out of the midde&s;t of the burning fire, as if it had bene out of a flaming pulpit, with an admira|ble feruour of &s;pirit, being indeed inflamed with the loue of IESVS CHRIST. Nor did he leaue darting out &s;uch fiery words, vntill him&s;elfe, togeather with his two mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed Companions, with wonderfull con&s;tancy ended their liues, and that in &s;o quiet a manner, as if they had been altogeather immoueable, and wrapt in heauenly contemplation.</P>
<P>This fir&s;t Pageant was repre&s;ented vpon the
<PB N="8" REF="5"> one and twentith day of Augu&s;t, in the yeare of our Lord 1622. in pre&s;ence of an infinite number of Chri|&s;tians, who by continuall acclamations and crying out, and calling vpon God to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, endeauou|red by all meanes po&s;&s;ible to encourage the holy Mar|tyrs to &s;uffer death patiently, for the loue of IESVS CHRIST.</P>
<P>The Executioners, as &s;oone as they perceyued that the Martyrs were dead, went, and expo&s;ed the heads of tho&s;e which they had fir&s;t &s;troken of, vpon a very high Table, to the greater feare, and terrour of all that &s;hould behold them. But the bodyes, a&s;well of tho&s;e that were beheaded, as of tho&s;e that were bur|ned, they layd them all vpon a heape togeather, with|in the place of execution, well guarded round about with railes of wood, as al&s;o with &s;ouldiers, vntill fur|ther order were giue~ what &s;hould be done with them.</P>
<P>The concour&s;e of the people that came thither both night and day to wor&s;hip tho&s;e Holy Reliques, was wonderfull; notwith&s;tanding the many and grie|uous blowes, yea and wounds which they receyued of the &s;ouldiers who were commanded there to watch, that no Chri&s;tian &s;hould take away any of the &s;ame. But yet all they could do, was not inough to preuaile again&s;t the good de&s;ires of the Chri&s;tians, but that &s;ome of the more principall &s;ort, what by their owne Indu&s;try, and what by bribing of the &s;ouldiers, with pious deceyt &s;tole away &s;ome of the bodyes. Among&s;t which they had a particular care to take away the whole body of Father <HI>Pedro de Zuniga,</HI> with intention to conuay it fir&s;t to the Citty of <HI>Manila,</HI> &amp; fro~ thence
<PB N="9" REF="5"> to &s;end it into <HI>Spaine,</HI> where the Honour of &s;o worthy a death, and the ornaments of &s;o glorious a Triumph, due not only to the excellency of his Vertue and Pie|ty, but al&s;o to the Nobility of his bloud and birth (his Father being Marque&s;&s;e of <HI>Manrique,</HI> &amp; &s;ometymes Viceroy of <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> or new <HI>Spaine</HI>) are expected to be celebrated with all due Reuerence and Solemnity.</P>
<P>The Gouernour of <HI>Nanga&s;achi,</HI> after he had be|&s;towed the crowne of Martyrdome vpon the&s;e victo|rious Champions, &s;ent his Officers to <HI>Omura</HI> to fetch tho&s;e other Chri&s;tians, of whome we made mention before, who lay there in pri&s;on, de&s;iring and longing for nothing &s;o much as to &s;ee that happy houre, wher|in they might come to &s;hed their bloud for the loue of IESVS Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Behold now heere, I be&s;eech you (Gentle Spe|ctators) behold heere a conflict, nay rather an admira|ble Combate, and &s;uch a Combate as the like was ne|uer &s;eene before in all <HI>Iaponia.</HI> Fiue and fifty valiant Champions of IESVS Chri&s;t, vpon one and the &s;elfe &s;ame day, obteined the victorious Palme of martyr|dome, in manner as followeth.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e mo&s;t happy Warryours of Chri&s;t, fiue &amp; twenty were taken out of pri&s;on at <HI>Omura,</HI> wherin, though &s;ome longer then others, yet all in generall, as young &s;ouldiers they had bene trayned vp in this pri|uate Fencing-Schoole, with &s;o hard, and mi&s;erable a v&s;age, as barbarous Heathens are accu&s;tomed to en|tertaine &s;uch gue&s;ts withall. For, there was made vnder the ground, a mo&s;t horrible and filthy Caue, &s;carce large inough for twelue ordinary matt-beds of
<PB N="10" REF="6"> bulru&s;hes, to lye one by another. Heere &s;ometimes thirty pri&s;oners, &s;ometimes more, three and three to a matte of eight palmes long, and three in breadth, were con&s;trained to lodge both night and day, with|out hauing &s;o much as one foote of roome more to &s;tir vp and downe in: &amp; which is more (and of it &s;elf alone had bene inough to di&s;patch them all in &s;hort tyme) in the very &s;ame roome, they were to giue place vnto the nece&s;&s;ity of nature. And as for their dyet, the daily pittance allowed them, was a little di&s;h of blacke Ryce, with a few broyled Pilchards, or as it chanced now and then a &s;uppe of broth, wherein Radi&s;h lea|ues had bene boyled.</P>
<P>In the meane time, while&s;t the Officers were taking the&s;e couragious Cha~pions out of the fore&s;aid mi&s;erable dungeon, to be conueyed to the place of ex|ecution, the Gouernour called for thirty men &amp; wo|men al&s;o out of the pri&s;on of <HI>Nanga&s;achi,</HI> whome he determined to put to death togeather, with tho&s;e that were to come from <HI>Omura.</HI> And when he had giuen &s;entence of death again&s;t them, commanding that the &s;ame &s;hould be put in execution the next day, he &s;ent them backe againe vnto pri&s;on: who albeit they went chayned all togeather, like malefactours, worthy to dye for mo&s;t notorious crymes; yet they departed fro~ the Iudgment &s;eat with great Ioy and Iubily of heart, euery one holding vp a Crucifix, or other Cro&s;&s;e in his hand, as high as he could, in &s;igne of Tryumph.</P>
<P>The troupe of couragious Women marched fir&s;t; among&s;t whome one more eminent, as Captayne, went before the re&s;t, with a banner of Chri&s;t IESVS
<PB N="11" REF="6"> crucifyed di&s;played in her hands. After her followed all the re&s;t in ma~ner of proce&s;&s;ion, &s;ounding forth the pray&s;es of Almighty God, with all honour, and mag|nificence, and contempt of the Idols with all &s;corne and reproach: wherof many of the woman lifted vp in their armes towards Heauen, their little &s;ucking Chri&s;tian Babes, as Sacrifices ready to be offred vn|to God together with them&s;elues.</P>
<P>After the women followed the vndaunted band of me~, putting likewi&s;e the~&s;elues in &s;uch order of proce&s;|&s;io~, that affoarded a mo&s;t worthy &amp; plea&s;a~t &s;hew vn|to the eyes of God, &amp; to all the Chri&s;tians that beheld the &s;ame; who not contented with the only beholding therof, but inflamed with an holy emulation of their hapines, went al&s;o in great nu~bers acco~panying the~, &amp; following their &s;teps with great reuere~ce &amp; deuotion.</P>
<P>Not long after this, entred into the Citty the fore&s;aid Pri&s;oners that were &s;ent for from <HI>Omura,</HI> in number fiue and twenty, among&s;t whome one and twenty were Religious men of diuers Orders: Whom when the Chri&s;tians of <HI>Nanga&s;achi</HI> beheld, what flock|ing made they (thinke you) to come to &s;ee, and to &s;a|lute them? Who is able to recount with what teares and &s;ighes euery one now entertained his gho&s;tly Fa|ther, by whome he had bene baptized, and regenera|ted in Chri&s;t IESVS? Who can expre&s;&s;e with what weeping and lamentation they deplored their owne mo&s;t lamentable ca&s;e, that the&s;e their &s;pirituall Fa|thers, Tutours, and Mai&s;ters, &s;hould now be depri|ued of life, by who&s;e meanes the life of grace had not only bene &s;o long nouri&s;hed and con&s;erued, but euen
<PB N="12" REF="7"> fir&s;t of all infu&s;ed into their &s;oules? In the meane tyme, the ioyfull Fathers cea&s;ed not to comfort their affli|cted children, bidding them be of good comfort; &amp; encouraging them to put their tru&s;t in the Fatherly protection of Almighty God; a&s;&s;uring them that his Infinite Goodnes would neuer let them want other Fathers and Mai&s;ters to nouri&s;h, and increa&s;e their good de&s;ires. And &s;o finally exhorting, &amp; animating them to per&s;euere con&s;tantly in the &s;incere and true fayth of IESVS Chri&s;t, euen vntill death, they tooke their la&s;t farewells.</P>
<P>Being now come vnto the place of execution, the Officers a&s;&s;igned euery one a pillar or &s;take, wher|at he was to be burned; which euery one of the holy Prie&s;ts, before they were bound vnto them, falling downe vpon his knees, with great reuerence imbra|ced, and &s;aluted with a thou&s;and ki&s;&s;es: The like al&s;o did the lay Religious Brothers, being moued therunto by the pious example of the Prie&s;ts. The &s;ight wherof was a cau&s;e of great admiration to the Beholders, and &s;tirred vp in the harts of many &s;o great feeling of de|uotion, that they could not refraine from teares.</P>
<P>In this meane tyme, while&s;t tho&s;e thirty pri&s;o|ners, which (as before we recounted) had bene &s;ent backe with their &s;entence of death to the pri&s;on, in the &s;ame Citty, were coming towards the &s;ame place of execution; the officers were bu&s;ied in binding to their &s;euerall pillars the fiue and twenty before na|med, all whome they bound but very loo&s;ely in or|der following.</P>
<P>Vnto the foure fir&s;t pillars were bound foure Men,
<PB N="13" REF="7"> condemned for no other crime, but only becau&s;e they had &s;ometimes entertained and lodged in their hou&s;es with great charity &s;ome of the &s;ayd Religious Fathers. Next vnto the&s;e &s;tood the one and twenty Religious men, &s;ome of <HI>Europe,</HI> and the re&s;t of <HI>Iaponia.</HI> The fir&s;t place among&s;t the&s;e, was allotted to the Reuerend Father <HI>Charles Spinola,</HI> an Italian Prie&s;t of the Society of IESVS, borne in <HI>Genua,</HI> and de&s;cended of the re|nowed Bloud and Family of the <HI>Spinola's,</HI> greatly re|uerenced and accounted of among&s;t all men, by rea|&s;on of his Birth, but much more in regard of his ex|cellent Vertue, his rare parts, and &s;ingular endowme~ts both of mind and body; as al&s;o for his exce&s;&s;iue and continuall labours &amp; paines, employed in cultiuating the vineyard of Chri&s;t IESVS in <HI>Iaponia,</HI> &s;o far from his Natiue Country, which he, and all the re&s;t of tho&s;e who were of Europe, had for&s;ake~ for the loue of God, to gaine &s;oules in <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P>After Father <HI>Spinola,</HI> followed the Reuere~d Fa. <HI>An|gelus Ferrerius</HI> of the order of <HI>S. Dominicke;</HI> Fa. <HI>Io&s;eph de S. Iacintho</HI> of the &s;ame Order; Fa. <HI>Iacinthus,</HI> al&s;o of the &s;ame. Then followed Father <HI>Seba&s;tian Quimura</HI> of the Society of IESVS, a Cittizen of <HI>Firandum</HI> borne in <HI>Ia|ponia,</HI> who had liued there thirty yeares in the Society of IESVS, of which he had bene Prie&s;t for the &s;pace of twenty; being him&s;elf the fir&s;t <HI>Iaponian</HI> that euer tooke vpo~ him the holy Order of Prie&s;thood, wherin he &s;he|wed him&s;elfe a mo&s;t worthy labourer in the vineyard of his Country, a ma~ endowed with &s;ingular Vertues, and an excellent Preacher in the Iaponian language.</P>
<P>Then followed the Reuerend Father <HI>Peter de A|uila</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="8"> of the order of <HI>S. Francis;</HI> Father <HI>Richard de S. An|na</HI> of the &s;ame Order; Father <HI>Alfon&s;us de Mena</HI> of the order of <HI>S. Dominicke;</HI> Father <HI>Francis de Morales</HI> of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>They that were not Prie&s;ts, were placed in this order: <HI>Vincentius,</HI> a Religious Brother of the order of <HI>Saint Francis</HI> borne in <HI>Europe: Anthony Fugia</HI> a Iapo|nian, of the Society of IESVS: <HI>Gon&s;aluus Fu&s;ay</HI> of the &s;ame Society and Countrey: <HI>Petrus Zampo</HI> of the &s;ame both religion and Countrey: <HI>Michael Iaponen&s;is</HI> of the &s;ame Order. After the&s;e againe followed foure o|ther of the order of <HI>S. Dominicke:</HI> And la&s;t of all were brought three of the Society of IESVS borne in <HI>Iapo|nia,</HI> to wit <HI>Thomas Aca&s;gin, Ludouicus Cauarato,</HI> who were likewi&s;e bound to their pillars, and <HI>Iohn Chacoco,</HI> who alone among&s;t tho&s;e fiue and twenty that were condemned to the fire, for want of a pillar whereat to be burned, was beheaded pre&s;ently; and fir&s;t of all obtayned the crowne of Martyrdome by the &s;word.</P>
<P>So as to reckon them ouer againe there were of &s;ecular men Foure, that were co~demned for receiuing of the Religious Fathers into their hou&s;es, Nine reli|gious men of the order of <HI>S. Dominicke,</HI> Three of Saint Francis, and Nine of the Society of IESVS, all which being put together, do make the full number of fiue and twenty Crowned-Martyrs. The Executioners had &s;carce made an end of placing and binding the&s;e vnto their pillars, when behold that other new troupe of thirty glorious Confe&s;&s;ours which were condem|ned to be beheaded, were brought to the &s;ame place, who as &s;oone as they &s;aw the religious men, they fell
<PB N="15" REF="8"> &s;odainly to imbracing, and &s;aluting them with many teares and &s;ighes.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the re&s;t, a certaine Matrone called <HI>I&s;a|bella Fernandez,</HI> came running to the pillar wherunto Father <HI>Charles Spinola</HI> was bound, to giue him the la&s;t farewell. She was the wydow of a mo&s;t noble Martyr who for hauing entertained the &s;aid Father in his hou&s;e had vnder gone a glorious death. She had a little child called <HI>Ignatius,</HI> &s;carce fiue yeares old, whom &s;he mo&s;t deerely and tenderly loued. When &s;he was euen now ready to lay hold vpon the pillar, and Father <HI>Charles</HI> ready to &s;alute her, he cryed out vnto her, <HI>&ocirc; I&s;abella, I&s;a|bella, vbi e&s;t tuus Ignatiolus? vbi est? vbi e&s;t, inquam, fi|liolus tuus?</HI> Where is your little <HI>Ignatius?</HI> where is, I &s;ay, your little Sonne? <HI>I&s;abella</HI> hearing this, as &s;he had her hart all inflamed and &s;et on fire, and to the end &s;he might make an&s;were no le&s;&s;e by deedes, the~ by words, made no more a doe, but &s;traight fetching forth her little One from among&s;t the throng of people, tooke him in her armes, and lifting him vp towards Heauen, pre&s;ented him before the Father, &s;aying: Behold heere (my deare&s;t Father) behold my little Sonne; behold heere I bring you my little <HI>Ignatius;</HI> I offer you my little &s;onne, that he may be &s;acrificed vnto God, and become a martyr, togeather with his mother, in this your Company.</P>
<P>When Father <HI>Charles</HI> &s;aw, and heard the Mother vtter &s;uch re&s;olute &s;peaches, co~cerning her little &s;o~ne, it is incredible what comfort, and &s;pirituall ioy he conceiued in his &s;oule.</P>
<P>Now approached the happy houre &s;o much lon|ged
<PB N="16" REF="9"> for of all this couragious Troupe: now was the fuell all &s;et ready round about the pillars; but before the fire was put vnto it, the Executioners, with mo&s;t barbarous cruelty, cut off the heads of tho&s;e thir|ty men and women, as al&s;o of twelue young children, the elde&s;t whereof was not yet full ten yeares old. And when it was demanded of them, Why they be|headed the&s;e before they had burned the others, that came fir&s;t to the &s;take? They an&s;wered, they did it, to terrify and di&s;animate them, that they might haue little courage to vndergoe the torme~t of the fire. And to the end they might better accompli&s;h what they did pretend, they tooke vp the heads of tho&s;e whome they had &s;laine, yet warme, and all-imbrued with their owne innocent bloud, and bowled, &amp; tumbled them vp and downe before their eyes.</P>
<P>But when they &s;aw that the holy Confe&s;&s;ours could not be daunted, or di&s;comfited with this, they kindled the fire. The fuell now, which on euery &s;ide enuironed the fiue and twenty Holy Martyrs, began indeed to flame, and burne vehemently: But (as many with particuler diligence ob&s;erued) there was a great &s;pace left betwixt the fire, and the Reli|gious men; and as &s;ome, that were more curious then others, and tooke the mea&s;ure of it, &s;ay it was no le&s;&s;e then three yards di&s;tant fro~ them on euery &s;ide. And this was al&s;o done of &s;et purpo&s;e, that they might be tormented &amp; con&s;umed by little and little, with a &s;low &amp; lingring fire; and therfore the Officers were &s;till ready at hand to quench the flame when it bur|ned too fa&s;t, for feare of di&s;patching them too &s;oone.</P>
<PB N="17" REF="9">
<P>But for what end did they this? For no other &s;urely, but that &s;uch as would for&s;ake their faith, and woor&s;hip their fal&s;e Gods, might the more ea&s;ily e&s;|cape. And for this purpo&s;e al&s;o they left their bands &s;o &s;lacke, that they might them&s;elues ea&s;ily vntye the~, and he that would yeild to the Pre&s;idents offer be|fore mentioned, might therby &s;aue his life. And for the &s;ame cau&s;e likewi&s;e they &s;et the gate of the place of Executio~ wide open, that who&s;oeuer would, might ca&s;t downe his crowne of Martyrdome, and e&s;cape both fire and &s;word.</P>
<P>But there was not found one among&s;t all the&s;e Glorious Confe&s;&s;ours, who did not in the very mid|de&s;t of the &s;corching flames reioyce and triumph in our Lord: Who did not fixe his eyes vpon Heauen, with all hope and confidence in God: and who did not finally indure the burning fire with a quiet and cheerfull heart, and with his whole body &s;o immo|ueable,

<P>Neither was it for any &s;hort tyme, that this ad|mirable Con&s;tancy of the valiant Champions, remai|ned &s;till inuincible, and vndaunted in the midde&s;t of the raging flames: For there wanted not &s;ome (who&s;e diligence is greatly to be commended) who hauing of purpo&s;e brought hower-gla&s;&s;es with them, to note the
<PB N="18" REF="10"> tyme, affirme, that mo&s;t of the&s;e holy Martyrs endu|red with incredible courage and magnanimity, this horrible torme~t, for the &s;pace of an hower and a halfe, and &s;ome others for the &s;pace of two whole howers. Nay (which is more) concerning the ble&s;&s;ed Martyr <HI>F. Sebastian Quimura</HI> of the Society of IESVS, they do con&s;tantly report, that they &s;aw him broyling aliue in the fire for the &s;pace of three whole howers, dilige~t|ly noted by the hower-gla&s;&s;es, to the wonderfull a&s;to|ni&s;hment of the Barbarous Gentils, who for many dayes after did talke of nothing el&s;e, but of this holy Martyrs &s;o long &s;ufferance, &amp; that not without great wonder, and admiration.</P>
<P>One thing there was, that among&s;t the re&s;t, was a chiefe and &s;peciall cau&s;e of the great courage and con&s;tancy of the&s;e noble Champions, I meane the &s;o extraordinary and great concour&s;e of Chri&s;tians that were pre&s;ent, which could not choo&s;e but be &s;o much the greater, by how much they had notice of the time &amp; place long before, by meanes a&s;well of the Procla|mation, as al&s;o in regard of the de&s;ire they had to &s;ee &s;o many famous Religious men, both of <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>Ia|ponia,</HI> and &s;uch venerable Prie&s;ts, who had &s;o long laboured and taken paines in the Vineyard of <HI>Iaponia,</HI> &s;ome for twenty, &s;ome for twenty fiue, yea and &s;ome for whole thirty yeares togeather.</P>
<P>But that we may make &s;ome ghe&s;&s;e at the number of the &s;pectatours, it will not be ami&s;&s;e to call to mind what Father <HI>Iohn Baptista de Baeza</HI> of the Society of IESVS, Rectour of <HI>Nanga&s;achi,</HI> who hath dwelt in <HI>Ia|ponia</HI> now full foure and thirty yeares, doth te&s;tify in
<PB N="19" REF="10"> his Letters &s;ent from thence to <HI>Manila,</HI> that there were to be found in that one only Citty of <HI>Nanga&s;achi,</HI> and in the Territory of the &s;ame, aboue fifty thou&s;and Chri&s;tians: &s;o as there were pre&s;ent an infinite num|ber of the &s;aid Chri&s;tians, to &s;ee, and with great ioy and comfort to behold, how cheerfully the&s;e holy Martyrs all ended their liues in the mid&s;t of burning flames; and how &s;ome of them as they were mo&s;t pit|tifully broyling, humbly falling vpon their knees, dyed mo&s;t &s;weetly, imbracing and ki&s;&s;ing their &s;takes which now togeather with the Martyrs, were halfe con&s;umed by the fire.</P>
<P>The fire was no &s;ooner out, but the Chri&s;tians in&s;tantly with great violence brake into the place of Execution, to reuerence and gather vp the &s;acred Reliques. The Barbarous Guard bega~ at fir&s;t to oppo&s;e them&s;elues again&s;t them, laying about them as hard as they could with their weapons: but when they &s;aw they could not preuaile by this meanes, they inuen|ted another, that therby both them&s;elues might &s;eeme to depart with victory from the holy Bodyes; and al|&s;o that there &s;hould not remaine the lea&s;t iote, or &s;igne of the &s;acred Reliques, in memory of the Martyrs.</P>
<P>The Pre&s;ident therfore commanded a huge deepe pit to be made in the ground, and in the &s;ame a very great fire of wood, and all the bodies of the ble&s;&s;ed Martyrs, togeather with the pillars and &s;takes wher|vnto they had byn tyed, to be ca&s;t into the &s;ame, and there burnt to a&s;hes, and la&s;tly all the a&s;hes very care|fully put in &s;ackes to be carryed in &s;hips farre out of the &s;ight of <HI>Nanga&s;achi,</HI> and there to be &s;cattered,
<PB N="20" REF="11"> and ca&s;t into the mayne &s;ea.</P>
<P>The day next en&s;uing after this mo&s;t illu&s;trious Martyrdome, which was the eleauenth of September, was beheaded <HI>M. Ga&s;par Cotengan-doxico,</HI> who was wont to accompany Father <HI>Camillus Con&s;tantius</HI> of the Society of IESVS, the Apo&s;tle of <HI>Iaponia;</HI> and who by trauailing vp and downe diuers parts of the Coun|try did greatly a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the conuer&s;ion of the Infi|dels. There were al&s;o beheaded with him two chil|dren, that were the &s;onnes of Martyrs, one wherof was but &s;eauen, the other a little aboue nine yeares old.</P>
<P>Another Chri&s;tian al&s;o as he was gathering vp &s;ome &s;mall Reliques or a&s;hes of the &s;acred bodyes of the burned Martyrs, which were kept with watch &amp; ward, within the for&s;aid place of Execution, was in the night apprehended, and brought before the Go|uernour; Who when he vnder&s;tood that he was a Cit|tizen of <HI>Omura,</HI> &s;ent him thither pre&s;ently as pri&s;oner, where the Gouernour of that Citty, as &s;oone as he arriued, put both him, and all his family to death; and &s;o for the fayth of Chri&s;t they all obtayned a crowne of Martyrdome.</P>
<P>The twelfth day of September there was at <HI>Omu|ra</HI> a famous Martyrdome of the R. Father <HI>Thomas de Summarega,</HI> one of the mo&s;t auncient among&s;t tho&s;e of <HI>S.

Francis;</HI> and al&s;o of diuers other Iaponians, who were all con&s;umed by fire, for the
<PB N="21" REF="11"> fayth and loue of IESVS Chri&s;t. Among&s;t the&s;e was a certaine Woman who&s;e admirable piety and deuotion de&s;erueth euerla&s;ting memory: for that after &s;he had beene found by the Officers among&s;t the &s;acred Reli|ques of the fornamed holy Martyrs, and had already giuen &s;ufficie~t te&s;timony, both by praying &amp; co~men|ding her &s;elfe to their merits, what &s;he was; being de|manded what &s;he was doyng, &amp; whether &s;he were a Chri&s;tia~, or no, an&s;wered very couragiou&s;ly, that they might ea&s;ily &s;ee, if they had eyes, by what &s;he did, that &s;he was a Chri&s;tian. And what, (&s;aid &s;he) will you haue any thing el&s;e with me? For this her re&s;olute an|&s;were they made no more a doe, but in&s;tantly in the &s;ame place cut off her head, and ca&s;t her body vpon the heape of the re&s;t of the Martyrs, which together with hers, do in all make the number of fifteene more.</P>
<P>Ten other holy Martyrs al&s;o, togeather with <HI>Au|gu&s;tine Onda</HI> of the Society of IESVS, who were all companions to Father <HI>Camillus Constantius</HI> of the &s;ame Society, were put to death at <HI>Yquinotima,</HI> a Towne of <HI>Iaponia</HI> nere vnto <HI>Firandum,</HI> for the fayth of Chri&s;t, being all burned aliue, and con&s;umed to a&s;hes.</P>
<P>But the happy death of Father <HI>Camillus</HI> fell vpon the fifteenth day of September at <HI>Firandum,</HI> who there obteined a Crowne of Glory, ending the cour&s;e of his Martyrdome by fire: where the concour&s;e of people was exceeding great, by rea&s;on that there were then lying in the Hauen at anker by <HI>Firandum,</HI> thirteene Engli&s;h and Holland &s;hips well fraught with mercha~|dize, and con&s;equently no &s;mall &s;tore of pa&s;&s;engers, Marriners, &s;ouldiers, factours, and the like, that came
<PB N="22" REF="12"> to &s;ee this &s;aid &s;pectacle. Father <HI>Camillus</HI> was an <HI>Ita|lian,</HI> borne in <HI>Romagnia,</HI> who could &s;peake the Flemi&s;h tongue well, and diuers other languages be&s;ides. He was a man of an Apo&s;tolicall &s;pirit, of which he gaue &s;ufficie~t te&s;timony by preaching in diuers Countries, wherby he greatly moued the peoples hearts, a&s;well by rea&s;on of his rare Eloquence, as of the vehement feruour of his deuotion. In this Amphitheater where he was to be con&s;umed by fire, from out the pile of wood, as from &s;ome chaire or pulpit, he made a &s;peach vnto all the &s;pectatours. But the Epilogue, or Con|clu&s;ion therof he conuerted vnto the <HI>Iaponians</HI> them|&s;elues alone, of who&s;e cu&s;tomes and ceremonies he had got no &s;mall knowledge: in which he mo&s;t effica|ciou&s;ly proued, and concluded, that the fayth of IE|SVS Chri&s;t was both true, nece&s;&s;ary, and &s;ecure. And whil&s;t be &s;pake thus, he did &s;o raui&s;h the <HI>Iaponians</HI> hearts with the &s;weet harmony of his Eloquence, that they would not &s;uffer the fire to be kindled &s;o &s;oone, as otherwi&s;e it &s;hould haue byn, that they might not be &s;o &s;oone depriued of that &s;weet fruite of his diuine &s;peach. Neyther was the heat of the fire able to ouer|come that heat of Charity which burned within his bre&s;t. For euen after that the wood was all &s;et on fire round about him, he &s;till ca&s;t out fiery words on euery &s;ide vnto all the beholders, and could neuer make an end of &s;peaking, vntill he made an end of liuing.</P>
<P>The &s;econd day of October, Nine other noble Martyrs illu&s;trated the Citty of <HI>Nanga&s;achi</HI> with their glorious deathes, wherof three little children died ma~|fully for the fayth of Chri&s;t. But that which happe|ned
<PB N="23" REF="12"> to one of the nine is admirable to recount: For being in mo&s;t cruell manner tortured for the &s;pace of &s;eauen dayes vpon the Racke, becau&s;e he refu&s;ed to betray, and di&s;couer certaine Religious men: not|with&s;tanding all their racking, they were not able to wre&s;t from him any other words then <HI>Ie&s;us Maria, O Ie&s;us Maria! O what an ardent and burning de&s;ire haue I to enter into the Glory of my Ie&s;us!</HI> with &s;uch other like exclamations. So as the Executioners now perceiuing on the one &s;ide, that they laboured in vaine, and on the other &s;ide, being a&s;hamed to acknowledge them|&s;elues to be ouercome by a Chri&s;tian, they opened (O mo&s;t barbarous or rather inhumane cruelty!) they o|pened, I &s;ay, a hole in the fle&s;h of his &s;houlder, and therin poured boyling lead: Notwith&s;tanding all this, the valiant Champion of IESVS Chri&s;t remained &s;till &s;o inuincible, that the Executioners quite de&s;payring of the victory, with all rage and fury ca&s;t him, toge|ther withall his family, into the fire, and when there was nothing el&s;e of them left but a&s;hes, they gathered them vp, and threw it into the &s;ea.</P>
<P>The 23. of September fiue other Chri&s;tians did con&s;ecrate their liues to God, for hauing entertained and hidden in their hou&s;es, the holy Martyr, Father <HI>Hyacinthus</HI> a Religious man of the Order of <HI>S. Domi|nicke,</HI> wherof three, to wit, the husband, his wife, and their Child, were burned, and the other two behea|ded.</P>
<P>The 27. day of May, fower miles from <HI>Firan|dum</HI> two other Chri&s;tians were put to death for the loue of IESVS Chri&s;t; the one for hauing lodged Fa|ther
<PB N="24" REF="13"> <HI>Camillus</HI> in his hou&s;e, the other for hauing carryed him in his Barke to diuers places, to and fro, to preach the holy Gho&s;pell of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Not long after this, happened a mo&s;t rare Mar|tyrdome of a very Venerable man of foure&s;core and fiue yeares old. This man was ca&s;t headlong into the &s;ea, hauing tyed vnto his feet two &s;o huge great &s;tones, that one of them would haue bene inough to load foure lu&s;ty &s;trong fellowes; who in&s;tantly, and as it were in the twinckling of an eye &s;unke downe to the very bottome: but behold a very &s;trang thing, as if both he, and the two great &s;tones al&s;o had beene made of the lighte&s;t Corke, he came gliding vp againe to the very top, where &s;wimming aboue the water, like the &s;wan he began to &s;ing before his death, and with a mo&s;t &s;weet &amp; plea&s;ant voice, he repeated thrice this mellifluous ditty <HI>Ie&s;us Maria, Ie&s;us Maria, Ie&s;us Maria,</HI> and then by the weight of the &s;toones being drawne downe againe into the &s;ea, neuer appeared more.</P>
<P>This Miraculous &s;ight and Martyrdome fell v|pon the 2. of Iune, to the great admiration of all the beholders, and particular ioy and comfort of innume|rable Chri&s;tians, that were pre&s;ent, and did &s;ee the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Vpon the next day after, which was the 3. of Iune another Chri&s;tian man, and companion of Father <HI>Ca|millus Constantius</HI> of the Society of IESVS, was likewi&s;e put to death, for hauing a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in Eccle&s;ia&s;tical functions and mini&s;teries. And vpon the 8. day of the &s;ame Moneth, another al&s;o &s;uffered death, for the &s;ame cau&s;e.</P>
<PB N="25" REF="13">
<P>Vpon the 28, of Iuly were three other Chri&s;tians, put to death, for a very &s;trange cau&s;e: for that (for|&s;ooth) they would not lend their hor&s;es to carry the holy Martyrs to execution; for indeed the Chri&s;tians did piou&s;ly belieue, and per&s;uade them&s;elues, that it was a &s;inne for any of them, &s;o lend his hor&s;e to help forward the execution of &s;o barbarous a Cruelty.</P>
<P>Two others al&s;o, that were Twinnes by birth, were put to a cruell Martyrdome, only for animating and encouraging of other Martyrs, that were &s;trug|ling hand to ha~d with death in a grieuous agony. And another likewi&s;e, in another place, was crowned with Martyrdome for refu&s;ing to lend his hor&s;e to carry the Martyrs to their death.</P>
<P>Neyther is he to be pa&s;&s;ed ouer with &s;ilence, who though his Name, and the manner of his Martyrdome in particuler be not knowne, yet was he put to death for the fayth of Chri&s;t in the Suburbes of a little town neere vnto <HI>Firandum,</HI> where certaine Husbandmen haue a few cottages for their habitation.</P>
<P>This mo&s;t illu&s;trious and glorious Combat of purpled Martyrs, died in their owne bloud, &s;hall be clo&s;ed vp and concluded with the death of that renow|ned Apo&s;tle of IESVS Chri&s;t, the R. Father <HI>Paulus Na|uarrus</HI> of the Society of IESVS, who&s;e memory in <HI>Iapo|nia</HI> will liue for euer, where him&s;elf gaue his life for his flocke which he had for the &s;pace of 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> yeares, like a good Sheepheard mo&s;t carefully fed, &amp; among&s;t &s;o many rauenous wolues mo&s;t &s;toutly defended.

<PB N="26" REF="14"> preach the Chri&s;tian fayth, therby to ouerthrow the wor&s;hip of their Idols, and fal&s;e Gods. When he had receiued this &s;entence, all repleni&s;hed with ioy and co~|fort, he was brought vnto the &s;take, or pillar; wher|to after he was bound, and the fire kinded about him, he began to preach IESVS Chri&s;t with his Apo&s;to|licall &s;pirit, and &s;o continued euen vnto the la&s;t ga&s;pe, when he rendred his ble&s;&s;ed and pure Soule into the hands of his Creatour, and receiued the Crowne of his glorious Martyrdome, vpon the fir&s;t day of No|uember, and fea&s;t of All-Saints.</P>
<P>Neyther did he enioy this happy Crowne alone, but had for his Companions, and fellow-&s;ouldiers in Chri&s;t IESVS, two Brothers of the &s;ame Society of IESVS, to wit, <HI>Dennis,</HI> and <HI>Peter Sandaye:</HI> from who&s;e company we mu&s;t in no ca&s;e exclude another Chri|&s;tian, that was both companion and guide to Father <HI>Paulus Nauarrus,</HI> to direct him the way vp and downe the country, and therfore de&s;erued in like manner to be made worthy of his ble&s;&s;ed death, in requitall of his kindne&s;&s;e, and togeather with him, to obtaine a glo|rious Crowne of Martyrdome.</P>

<P>The &s;ame day, <HI>Mary Pariente</HI> wife to <HI>Alon&s;o Bue&s;&s;o,</HI> who hauing no v&s;e at all of her left arme, after &s;he had &s;ought and applied many remedies without any good &s;ucce&s;&s;e, but rather greater harme, &s;eing that in|&s;teed of curing her, the Chirurgeons had broken the bone of her arme, &amp; that the Phi&s;itians had now aban|doned her as one de&s;perate &amp; incurable: And calling to mind what had pa&s;&s;ed with <HI>Mary Gua&s;con</HI> afore|&s;aid, prayed thus deuoutly into the Saint: O ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Ignatius,</HI> if God through thy merits, would be plea&s;ed to cure me, I would &s;hew forth his prai&s;es and thine, to my vttermo&s;t power. And euen at that in&s;tant, &s;he felt in her left arme, a great conuul&s;ion of the bones and &s;ynewes, and pre&s;ently after found her &s;elfe well, and her arme perfectly recouered. Wherfore with a loud voyce &s;he vttered the&s;e words, <HI>I am whole, and cured by the fauour and merits of S.

<P>Within a while after <HI>Mary Santijus</HI> wife to <HI>Pa&s;|qual Bueno de la Muda,</HI> who being almo&s;t blind, and could only di&s;cerne but the bulkes of bodies, with|out knowing any per&s;on; comming to the Chap|pell where the fore&s;aid picture was newly &s;et vp,

<P><HI>Bernardina Benedid</HI> of the age of 31. yeares, wife to <HI>Philip Gomez,</HI> dwelling in <HI>Munebrega,</HI> had for the &s;pace of eight yeares bene torme~ted with diuers di&s;ea|&s;es, as hauing one vlcer in the liuer, and another in the &s;pleene, togeather which a defluction from the Head to the Lungs; and &s;ometimes al&s;o there grew a kind of impo&s;tume in her &s;tomacke, which breaking made her vomite much putrified matter, and bloud; by which meanes &s;he came to haue &s;o great weakenes and debi|lity of &s;tomacke, that for &s;ix yeares togeather &s;he could not retaine any kind of meate, but was fayne pre&s;ently to ca&s;t all vp againe; &amp; when&s;oeuer &s;he v&s;ed any force to hold it in, it would breake through her no&s;trills: &amp; in ca&s;e there remained any thing behind, cleauing to &s;ome parts of the &s;tomacke, it bred &s;uch &s;tore of bloud, that nece&s;&s;arily she was driue~ to be let bloud twice or thrice euery other moneth, for feare of being choaked; by which meanes al&s;o &s;he fell many tymes into fits of &s;woundings, and at la&s;t was brought &s;o low and fee|ble that &s;he &s;eemed nothing els but skin and bones, being vnable either to &s;tirre her &s;elfe, or &s;uffer that o|thers
<PB N="33" REF="18"> &s;hould &s;o much as touch her, for feare of increa|&s;ing her great paines.

At which <HI>Phi|lip Gomez</HI> her &s;onne, much grieuing and lamenting his mothers pittifull ca&s;e, told her, that he would carry her to the Church where <HI>S.

She an|&s;wered that, that was euen to carry her thence to her graue, by rea&s;on of her weakenes. Pre&s;ently after came in Father <HI>Valerius Piquer,</HI> &amp; &s;ayd vnto her: Haue confidence in God, and in his Saint: and withall gaue vnto her a Relique of <HI>S.

Vpon this &s;he fell into a &s;wound, and extraordinary &s;weate: but when &s;he came to her &s;elfe againe, &s;he cryed out; I find my &s;elfe throughly well, let me go to the Saints Picture in the Church. And within halfe an houre af|ter (for before &s;he could not get away from the peo|ple which came &s;o fa&s;t into the hou&s;e to &s;ee her) &s;he ro&s;e vp from her bed well and &s;trong, and went alone downe the &s;tayres: but the people not permitting her to go any further a foote, would needes carry her to the Church doore in a chaire, from whence &s;he went her &s;elfe on foote to the Chappell, and gaue thankes to God, and to <HI>S.

<P>And after &s;he had ended her prayer, &s;he returned home to her own hou&s;e a foote, &amp; &s;upped with the re&s;t

The next day after &s;he went againe to the Church, where &s;he made her Confe&s;&s;ion and receiued the ble&s;&s;ed Sa|crament with great deuotion and thanksgiuing, &s;till remaning in good health &amp; perfect &s;trength of body.</P>
<P><HI>Pa&s;chalis Gabrerizo</HI> an hone&s;t poore inhabitant of <HI>Munebrega</HI> had bene for the &s;pace of 12 yeares di&s;ea|&s;ed, and &s;o benummed in his feet, that he was not able to go without one crutch at lea&s;t; be&s;ides, he had no v&s;e of one of his armes, and did almo&s;t continually &s;uffer extreame paine of the Goute, togeather with a great palpitation of the hart.

The Ma&s;&s;e be|ing ended, he ro&s;e vp with his Crutch to go backe to|wards his hou&s;e, and at the Church doore he found him&s;elfe wel, and free from the lamene&s;&s;e of his leggs: &s;o as ca&s;ting away his Crutch, he very nimbly and &s;peedily went vp and downe, prai&s;ing God and <HI>S.

<PB N="35" REF="19"> all the towne of <HI>Munebrega,</HI> that mo&s;t of the people lea|uing their &s;hops and hou&s;es repayred and flocked to the Church to admire the &s;ucce&s;&s;e; and the poore man was there found among&s;t them giuing thanks to God and the Saint: in who&s;e Chappell he hanged vp his Crutch for a perpetuall memory.</P>
<P>A little child called <HI>Mary Pardo</HI> daughter to <HI>Do|minike Pardo,</HI> and <HI>Magdalene Ximeno,</HI> dwellers of <HI>Mune|brega,</HI> had &s;ome two yeares before fallen into the fire, and burnt her left arme, e&s;pecially about the Elbow, wherby the &s;ynewes were dryed &amp; &s;hrunke vp in &s;uch &s;ort, that &s;he had no v&s;e at all of that arme. <HI>Peter de Vil|lar,</HI> a Religious man of <HI>S.

<P><HI>Mary Corriz,</HI> wife to <HI>Pedro Bueno</HI> dwelling in the towne of <HI>Munebrega,</HI> hauing a foule Canker in one of her legs wherby &s;he was in da~ger to haue it cut off, cau|&s;ed a Ma&s;&s;e to be &s;aid at the Altar of <HI>S.

The good woman followed the Chirurgeons coun&s;ayle, &amp; went to <HI>Munebrega</HI> to vi&s;it the Chappell of <HI>S.

<P>There was another woman in <HI>Munebrega,</HI> a wid|dow and very poore, who had a grieuous &s;oare in her right foote, and both her legs greatly &s;wollen, which made her perforce go with crutches. Being thus priuy to her owne mi&s;ery and affliction, &amp; &s;eing the wonders which God did worke by meanes of <HI>S.

But fir&s;t of all &s;he forgot not to render her be&s;t thankes
<PB N="37" REF="20"> vnto God, and the Saint for &s;o &s;ingular a benefit.</P>
<P><HI>Agnes Cauallero</HI> wife to <HI>Martin de Huerta</HI> Inha|bitants of <HI>Nueualo,</HI> being blind, in &s;uch manner as that &s;he could not go a &s;tep without a guide, hauing al&s;o a foule Canker growing ouer one of her lips; and hea|ring of the miracles which <HI>S.

She was led thither, &amp; for the &s;pace of 3. dayes made conti|nuall prayer with great deuotion and confidence in his Chappell, &amp; annoynting her lip and eyes with the oile of the Lampe that burned before his Altar, obtay|ned perfect recouery both of her lippe &amp; eyes; &amp; euer &s;ince her eye-&s;ight hath bene &s;o good, as &s;he is able to threed a very &s;mall needle.</P>
<P><HI>Antony Franco</HI> inhabitant of <HI>Castejon</HI> vpon <HI>Alarua</HI> in <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> hauing bene abroad, came home to his hou&s;e with a burning feuer on his backe, and an impo&s;tu|me al&s;o, ri&s;en through heate, in his &s;tomacke, which cau&s;ed him extreme payne. The Phi&s;itian came vnto him, and &s;eing that his &s;icknes was mortall, bad him di&s;po&s;e of his &s;oule, and temporall e&s;tate, for he could not a&s;&s;ure him aboue twelue houres of life.

<P>The Phi&s;itian which dwelleth at this day in <HI>Mu|nebrega,</HI> had an Infant &s;ome 2. or 3. monthes old, that being fed with certaine &s;ops, was choaked on a &s;ud|daine, and as his Father iudged, and &s;ince prote&s;ted &s;tarke dead, in &s;o much that he gaue order for his bu|riall; but the mother with more fayth and deuotion, annoynted her little babe with &s;ome of the oyle of the lampe of <HI>S. Ignatius,</HI> making deuout &s;upplication to the Saint for the recouery of life againe in her &s;onne, and therwith all &s;he offred him to <HI>S. Ignatius.</HI> At that very in&s;tant the child came againe to him&s;elfe, and be|gan to cry, and by the fauour and merits of the Saint, continueth &s;till in perfect health.</P>
<P>&para; This fore&s;aid Picture of <HI>S. Ignatius,</HI> which God Almighty hath made the meanes of &s;o many, and &s;o wonderfull miracles, &s;ome &s;ixteene yeares &s;ince was, by <HI>Don Rocque de Villar</HI> Chanon of <HI>Calatayude,</HI> fir&s;t &s;et vp in the Sacri&s;ty, or Ve&s;try of the Pari&s;h Church of <HI>Munebrega,</HI> togeather with other Founders of Reli|gious Orders amo~g&s;t the pictures of diuers Cardinals, Archbi&s;hops, Bi&s;hops, Mai&s;ters of the Order of Knight|hood of <HI>Malta,</HI> Vicechancellours, Iu&s;tices, Coun|cellors of E&s;tate, Iudges of his Catholike Maie&s;ty, and of other worthy and famous Per&s;ons, which had bene &s;ometimes promoted from this place to the&s;e dignities;
<PB N="43" REF="23"> and being compared with many other pictures of the &s;ame Saint, &s;eemeth to differ from them all, as &s;hewing, &s;omewhat &s;uperiour, and extraordinary, for the ma|ie&s;ty it carrieth in the Face.</P>
<P>Vpon the fir&s;t Friday, after it was placed vpon the Altar, being the 21. day of Aprill, hauing bene kept alwayes before in a dry place, it began to &s;weat on the right &s;ide vnder the arme, and &s;o continued for the &s;pace of 4. howers; which &s;weat was an extraordina|ry kind of liquor, much differing from water, although it &s;eemed &s;o in colour, as al&s;o from oyle, or any other running liquor; but it came out &s;welling, like certaine full &amp; thicke drops; and as fa&s;t as it was dryed vp, pre|&s;ently the &s;ame liquor began to flow out againe; all which was gathered, and drunke vp with two great linnen Towlls, and is yet there kept.</P>
<P>Vpon Friday al&s;o a fortnight after, being the 5. of <HI>May,</HI> the &s;ame &s;weat began againe to flow forth, for the &s;pace of two houres. Witne&s;&s;es of the&s;e &s;weatings were many Eccle&s;ia&s;ticall, and Religious per&s;ons, who &s;aw them, &amp; the R. Father <HI>Friar Peter Villar</HI> of the Or|der of <HI>S. Augu&s;tine,</HI> and Bachelour of Diuinity, did wet two handkerchers therwith, which are kept vn|till this day.</P>
<P>Some few dayes after, a certaine woman of the towne of <HI>Alarua,</HI> hauing heard of the miracles of <HI>S. Ig|natius,</HI> out of a de&s;ire to find remedy again&s;t a dange|rous great &s;welling which &s;he had in her bre&s;ts, to her extreme griefe and payne; came to <HI>Munebrega</HI> and re|co~mending her &s;elfe deuoutly to the Saint, in his Chap|pell, pre&s;ently &s;he felt certaine drops of water to run
<PB N="44" REF="24"> downe her brea&s;t, as if it had bene &s;ome &s;weat of that &s;welling, which much ea&s;ed her paine, and which be|gan to grow le&s;&s;e. Vpon this, one of the Towells wher|with the &s;weat afore&s;aid of the Picture had byn dryed vp, was applyed vnto her bre&s;t, and the &s;welling pre|&s;ently re&s;olued it &s;elfe into great aboundance of water, &amp; by and by after the woman remained wholy cured.</P>
<P>Many other famous miracles haue bene wrought there, by the Merits and Interce&s;&s;ion of <HI>S. Ignatius,</HI> which do exceed the number of an hundred; all which haue byn wrought within the &s;pace of one month, and are mo&s;t notorious to all the Inhabitants therabout. A|mong&s;t which, be&s;ides tho&s;e aboue mentioned, there haue byne foure blind re&s;tored to their &s;ight, many Cripples, many deafe, and many &s;icke of diuers infir|mityes perfectly cured. So that it would be ouer long to recount them all heere in this briefe Relation, &s;ince there &s;carce pa&s;&s;eth any day, wherin &s;ome one miracle or other is not wrought, and &s;ome dayes three or foure. Therfore it is no meruaile if vpon the certaine fame of &s;o many, and continuall miracles, there be &s;o great concour&s;e of people, from all parts of <HI>Arragon,</HI> and o|ther places of <HI>Spaine,</HI> vnto this Chappell of <HI>S. Ignatius.</HI></P>
<P>Al&s;o many Cittyes, Townes, and Villages do daily repaire thither in &s;olemne Proce&s;&s;ion; in &s;o much that continually the Church of <HI>Munebrega</HI> is full of Pil|grims, &s;ome blind, &s;ome lame, &s;ome with vlcers, others with other di&s;ea&s;es, who daily through the merits and interce&s;&s;ion of this glorious Saint do receiue health, and mo&s;t &s;ingular fauours at the hands of God. And if the Church of <HI>Munebrega</HI> were &s;ix times larger the~ it is
<PB N="45" REF="24"> (and it is of a rea&s;onable good bignes:) yet would it be too little for all commers, who &s;triue to be there early in the morning, yea, and many tymes remayne there all night, to occupy, and preuent the getting of a good and commodious place.</P>
<P>Moreouer, it is iudged for a thing certaine, that there is no one holy Place or Pilgrimage throughout all <HI>Spaine,</HI> more frequented at this day, then is the for&s;aid Chappell of Saint Ignatius in <HI>Munebrega.</HI> Wherfore the &s;ayd towne of <HI>Munebrega</HI> hath cho&s;en this Saint Ignatius, for their &s;peciall Patron, and vowed to cele|brate his fea&s;t yearely with all &s;olemnity po&s;&s;ible. Al&s;o in <HI>Maluenda, Villaroy,</HI> and other places within the Pre|cincts, and Territoryes of <HI>Calatayude,</HI> they haue lately dedicated diuers Chappells and Altars vnto <HI>S. Ignatius</HI> of Loyola, Founder of the Society of IESVS.</P>
<P>That which mo&s;t of all ought to be pondered, co~|cerning this famous place of Pilgrimage, is the great fruite, and the notable conuer&s;ions of many lo&s;t and damnable &s;oules, which vpon this occa&s;ion hath byn wrought by generall Confe&s;&s;ions; be&s;ides the wonder|full changes in many from mo&s;t wicked and de&s;perate, vnto vertuous and godly liues. And without all doubt, this is that, which principally <HI>S. Ignatius</HI> pretendeth by the working of &s;o great Miracles. For although in his life tyme, he alwayes exerci&s;ed him&s;elfe in Corporall workes of Mercy; yet principally did he practi&s;e the Spirituall, with all po&s;&s;ible endeauour, as mo&s;t grate|full, and plea&s;ing to the diuine Goodnes.</P>
