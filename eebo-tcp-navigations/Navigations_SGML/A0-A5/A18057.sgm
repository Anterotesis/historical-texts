<P>_WHen I had taken in hande to tran|&s;late thys Treati&s;e, which I did for the benefite and behoofe of tho&s;e that &s;hall attempt any newe di&s;co|uerie in the Northwea&s;t partes of <HI>America,</HI> I thought good brieflye to touch the v&s;e of my tran&s;lation, that the Reader may &s;ee and con|&s;ider the drift of my trauell. For, al|though this Di&s;cour&s;e may &s;eeme very barraine, and not to containe &s;uche matter as is pretended, as beyng a particular Relation of certaine Prouinces whyche haue beene hitherto of all men rather contemned than throughly knowen: yet if the Marchant Venturer, or skilfull Pilot, or who&s;oeuer de|&s;irous of newe Di&s;coueries, haue the readyng and peru&s;ing thereof, for whome e&s;pecially I haue done it into Engli&s;he, they will find matter worthy the looking, and con&s;equently, gratefully accept my paines herein. For here is the De&s;crip|tion of a Countrey no le&s;&s;e fruitful and plea&s;ant in al re&s;pects than is <HI>England, Fraunce,</HI> or <HI>Germany,</HI> the people, though &s;im|ple and rude in manners, and de&s;titute of the knowledge of God or any good lawes, yet of nature gentle and tractable, and mo&s;t apt to receiue the Chri&s;tian Religion, and to &s;ubiect them&s;elues to &s;ome good gouernement: the commodities of the Countrey not inferiour to the Marchandize of <HI>Mo&s;couy, Danske,</HI> or many other frequented trades: the voyage verye &s;horte, being but three weekes &s;ayling from <HI>Bristowe, Plym|mouth,</HI> or any commodious Porte of the Wea&s;t Country, with

a direct cour&s;e to the coa&s;t of the Newe found land. Al which oportunities be&s;ides manye others, mighte &s;uffice to induce oure Engli&s;hemen, not onely to fall to &s;ome traffique wyth the Inhabitants, but al&s;o to plant a Colonie in &s;ome conueni|ent place, and &s;o to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e the Countrey without the gain|&s;aying of any man, whiche was the iudgement and coun&s;ell of <HI>Iohn Baptista Ramu&s;ius,</HI> a learned and excellent Co&s;mogra|pher, &amp; Secretary to the famous &s;tate of <HI>Venice,</HI> who&s;e words, bicau&s;e they are not impertine~t to this purpo&s;e, I haue here &s;et downe. Why doe not the Princes (&s;aieth he) whyche are to deale in the&s;e affaires, &s;ende forth two or three Colonies to in|habite the Country, &amp; to reduce this &s;auage natio~ to &s;ome ci|uilitie? con&s;idering what a battle and fruitfull &s;oyle it is, how repleni&s;hed with all kinde of graine, how it is &s;tored wyth al &s;ortes of Byrdes and Bea&s;tes, wyth &s;uch faire and mighty Ri|uers, that Captaine <HI>Carthier</HI> and his company, in one of them &s;ayled vppe a hundreth and foure &s;core leagues, findyng the countrey peopled on both &s;ides in greate abundaunce. And moreouer, to cau&s;e the Gouernors of tho&s;e Colonies to &s;end forth men to &s;earch and di&s;couer the North lands about <HI>Ter|ra del Lauorader,</HI> and toward Wea&s;t northwea&s;t to the Seas whiche are to &s;aile to the Country of <HI>Cataya,</HI> and from thence to the Ilands of <HI>Molucke.</HI> The&s;e were enterpri&s;es to purcha&s;e immortall prai&s;e, which the Lord <HI>Anthony di Mendoza</HI> Vice|roy of <HI>Mexico,</HI> willing to put in execution, &s;ent forth his Cap|tains both by Sea and by Land vpon the Northwea&s;t of <HI>Nuo|ua Spagona,</HI> and di&s;couered the Kingdome of the &s;eauen Cities about <HI>Ciuola</HI>&punc; And <HI>Franci&s;cus Va&s;ques de Coronada,</HI> pa&s;&s;ed from <HI>Mexico</HI> by lande towarde the Northwea&s;t 2850. miles, in &s;o muche, that he came to the Sea, whyche lyeth betweene <HI>Ca|taya</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> where he met with the Catayan &s;hyppes. And no doubt, if the French men in this their newe <HI>Fraunce,</HI> would haue di&s;couered vp further into the land towards the Wea&s;t northwea&s;t partes, they &s;houlde haue founde the Sea, and might haue &s;ayled to <HI>Cataya.</HI> Thus much out of <HI>Ra|mu&s;ius,</HI> where you may &s;ee this learned mans iudgement con|cerning

All whyche thyngs, ex|cepte they builde and inhabite, can neuer be atchieued, for as <HI>Fraunci&s;cus Lopez di Gomara,</HI> and dyuers other Spani&s;he Au|thors affirme, the Spanyards neuer pro&s;pered or preuailed, but where they planted: whych of the Portingales maye al|&s;o be verifyed, as in the Hi&s;tories of all theyr Conque&s;ts and Di&s;coueries doth manife&s;tly appeare. And as there is none, that of right may be more bolde in this enterprice than the Engli&s;hmen, the land being fir&s;t found out by <HI>Iohn Gabot</HI> the Father, and <HI>Sebastian Gabot,</HI> one of hys three &s;onnes, in the yeare 1494. in the name and be halfe of King <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ea|uenth, as both by the fore&s;aide <HI>Ramu&s;ius</HI> in his fir&s;t Volumes, and our owne Chronicles, and <HI>Sebastian Gabots</HI> letters pa|tents yet extant, and in his Mappe maye be &s;eene: &s;o there is no nation that hath &s;o good righte, or is more fit for this pur|po&s;e, than they are, who trauayling yearely into tho&s;e partes with 50. or 60. &s;aile of &s;hippes, might very commodiou&s;lye tran&s;porte a &s;ufficient number of men to plant a Colonie in &s;ome conuenient Hauen, and al&s;o might yeeld them yearly &s;uccour, and &s;upply of al things nece&s;&s;ary, receyuing againe &s;uch commodities as the country doth produce. And this the Frenchmen had done long &s;ince, if fir&s;t their warres with the Spanyardes, and &s;ince their cruell di&s;&s;entions at home, had not hindered them. And <HI>Iohannes Varrozzana</HI> a Florentine, if he had not beene preuented by death, purpo&s;ed (as the fore|&s;ayde <HI>Ramu&s;ius</HI> writeth) to per&s;wade <HI>Francis</HI> the French King to &s;end forth good &s;tore of people to inhabite certaine places of the&s;e coa&s;tes, where the aire is mo&s;te temperate, and the &s;oyle mo&s;te fruitfull, with goodly Riuers and Hauens &s;uffici|ent to harborough any nauie, the inhabitantes of which pla|ces might be occa&s;io~ to bring many good purpo&s;es to effecte,

and amonge&s;t manye others, to reduce tho&s;e poore rude and ignorant people to the true wor&s;hip and &s;eruice of God, and to teache them how to manure and till the ground, tran&s;por|ting ouer Bea&s;tes and Cattell of <HI>Europe</HI> into tho&s;e large and champion countreys, and finally, in time they might di&s;couer vp into the land, and &s;earch, whether among &s;o many Ilands as are there, there be any pa&s;&s;age to the Sea of <HI>Cataya.</HI> And thus much oute of the third Volume of Voyages and Naui|gations, gathered into the Italian tongue by <HI>Ramu&s;ius:</HI> whi|che Bookes, if they were tran&s;lated into Engli&s;h by the libe|ralitie of &s;ome noble Per&s;onage, ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Sea-men of <HI>England,</HI> and others, &s;tudious of Geographie, &s;houlde know many worthy &s;ecrets, whiche hitherto haue beene concealed.

The Thur&s;day following we came to &s;euen very high Ilandes, whiche we named <HI>The round Ilands.</HI> The&s;e Ilandes are di&s;tant from the others a|bout fourtie leagues, and &s;tretche out into the Sea aboute thr&eacute;e or foure leagues. Aboute the&s;e there are goodly lowe groundes to be &s;&eacute;ene full of goodlye tr&eacute;es, whiche we the Fry|day following, with our boates compa&s;&s;ed aboute. Ouer|thwart the&s;e Ilandes there are diuer&s;e &s;andie &s;helues more than two leagues into the &s;ea, very daungerous, whiche at a a lowe water remaine almo&s;t dry. At the furthe&s;t boundes of the&s;e lowe Ilands, that containe about tenne leagues, ther is a riuer of fre&s;h water, that with &s;uch &s;wiftne&s;&s;e runneth into the &s;ea, that for the &s;pace of one league within it the water is as fre&s;he as anye fountaine water. We with our boates entred into the &s;aide riuer, at the entraunce of whiche we fou~d about one fadome water. There are in this riuer many fi&s;hes &s;haped like hor&s;&s;es, which as our wilde men told vs, al the daye long lye in the water, and the night on lande: of which we &s;awe therein a great number.

In the &s;ame place by occa&s;ion of contrarie winds and foggie my&s;tes, we were con&s;trayned to &s;tay, not being either able to come out of it, or hoy&s;e &s;ayle til the four &amp; twentith of the month. On which day we departed &amp; came to a hauen on the Southerly coa&s;t, about 80. leagues from the &s;aid Ilands. This hauen is ouer again&s;t thr&eacute;e flat Ila~ds y^t lye amid&s;t a riuer, bycau&s;e on the half way of y^e &s;ayd Ilands, &amp; the &s;aid Hauen toward the North, there is a verye great riuer that runneth betw&eacute;ene the high &amp; low Ilands, &amp; more than thr&eacute;e leagues into the &s;ea: it hath many &s;helues, &amp; there is not altogither one fadome water, &s;o that the place is very dangerous: &amp; from bank to bancke of the &s;aide &s;helues, there is either xv. or xx. yardes. All the Northerly co&s;t ru~neth Ea&s;t Northea&s;t and South Southwe&s;t. The &s;aide hauen wherin we &s;tayed, is as it were but a &s;luce of the waters that ri&s;e by the floud, and but of &s;mal accompt, we named them <HI>S.

<HEAD>&para; How we came to the Towne of <HI>Hochelaga,</HI> and the entertaynemente there we had, and of certayne giftes oure Captayne gaue them, with diuers other things. CHAP. 8.</HEAD>
<P>SO &s;oone as we were come n&eacute;ere the Towne, a greate number of the inhabitoures thereof came to pre&s;ente them&s;elues before vs after their fa&s;hion, making very much of vs: we were by our guides brought into the mid&s;t of the Towne. They haue in the middlemo&s;t parte of their hou&s;es a large &s;quare place, b&eacute;eing from &s;ide to &s;ide a good &s;tones ca&s;t, where we were brought, and there with &s;ignes were commaunded to &s;tay: then &s;uddaynely all the Women and Maydens of the Towne gathered them&s;elues togither, parte of which had their armes full of yong Children, and as ma|nie as could, came to rubbe our faces, our armes, and what parte of the bodye &s;oeuer they could touch, w&eacute;eping for verye ioy that they &s;aw vs, &s;hewing vs the be&s;t countenance that po&s;&s;ible was, de&s;iring vs with theyr &s;ignes, that it woulde plea&s;e vs to touche theyr Children. That done, the menne cau&s;ed the Women to withdrawe them&s;elues backe, then they euery one late downe on the ground round about vs, as if they would haue &s;hewen and rehear&s;ed &s;ome Comedie, or other &s;hew: then pre&s;ently came the Women agayne, euery one bringing a foure&s;quare Matte in manner of Carpettes, and &s;preading them abroad on the ground in that place: then they cau&s;ed vs to &s;it vpon them. That done, the Lord &amp; King of y^e country was brought vpon nine or ten mens &s;houlders, (whome in theyr toung they call <HI>AGOVHANNA</HI>) &s;itting vpon a great Stagges Skinne, and they layde him downe vpon the for&s;ayde mattes n&eacute;ere to our Captayne, euery one beckning vnto vs that he was theyr Lord and King. This <HI>Agouhanna</HI> was a manne aboute fiftie yeares olde: he was no whitte better apparelled than any of the re&s;t, onely ex|cepted,

that he had a certaine thing made of bea&s;ts Skinnes (called <HI>Ricc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>) like a redde towell, and that was in &s;teade of his Crowne. He was full of the pal&s;ey, and his members &s;hronke togither. After he had with certayne &s;ignes and beckes &s;aluted our Captaine and all his company, and by manife&s;t tokens bidde vs all welcome, he &s;hewed his legges and armes to our Captaine, and with &s;ignes de&s;i|red him to touch them, and &s;o he did, rubbing them with hys owne hands: then did <HI>Agouhanna</HI> take the wreath or crown he had about his head, and gaue it vnto our Captaine, that done, they broughte before him diuer&s;e di&s;ea&s;ed men, &s;ome blinde, &s;ome criple, &s;ome lame and impotent, and &s;ome &s;o olde that the heare of their eyel&eacute;eds came downe and couered their Ch&eacute;ekes, and laide them al along before our Captaine, to the ende they mighte of him be touched: for it &s;&eacute;emed vnto them that God hadde bene de&s;cended and come downe from Heauen to heale them. Our Captaine &s;&eacute;eing the mi&s;ery and deuotio~ of this poore people, recited the Go&s;pel of <HI>Saint Iohn,</HI> that is to &s;aye, <HI>In the beginning was the word:</HI> touching eue|rie one that were di&s;ea&s;ed, praying to God that it wold plea&s;e him to open the harts of this poore people, and to make them knowe his holy worde, and that they might receiue bapti&s;me and Chri&s;tendome: that done, he toke a booke in his hande, &amp; with a lowde voyce redde all the pa&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t, worde by word, that al the by&s;tanders might hear him, al which while this poore people kept &s;ilence, &amp; were maruellou&s;ly attentiue, loking vp to heaue~, &amp; imitating vs in ge&s;turs. The~ h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> cau&s;ed he men al orderly to be &s;et on one &s;ide, y^e wome~ on another, &amp; likewi&s;e the children on another, and to the chiefe&s;t of them he gaue Hatchets, to the other kniues, and to the women beades, and &s;uch other &s;mal trifles. Then where the children were, he ca&s;te rings, counters, and branches made of Tin, whereat they &s;&eacute;emed to be verie gladde. That done, our Cap|taine commaunded Shaw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es, and other mu&s;ical in&s;trume~ts to be &s;ounded, which when they heard, they were very mer|rie. Then we toke our leaue and wente to our boate&punc; the wo|me~

&s;&eacute;eing that, put them&s;elues before to &s;tay vs, and brought vs out of their meates that they had made readie for vs, as fi&s;he, pottage, beanes, and &s;uche other things, thinking to make vs eate, and dine in that place: but bycau&s;e the meats hadde no &s;auoure at all of &s;alte, we liked them not, but than|ked them, and with &s;ignes gaue them to vnder&s;tand that we hadde no n&eacute;ede to eate. When we were out of the Towne, diuer&s;e of the men and women followed vs, and broughte vs to the toppe of the for&s;ayde mountaine, which we named <HI>Mount Roiall,</HI> it is aboute a league from the Town.

The di&s;tance ouer from one &s;ide to the other, is about 35. or 40. leagues. In the midde&s;t it is aboue 100. faddome deepe. The &s;ure&s;t way to &s;ayle vpon it, is on the South &s;ide, and towarde the North, that is to &s;ay, from the &s;ayd &s;eauen Ilandes, where from &s;ide to &s;ide, there is &s;eauen leagues, where are al&s;o two great Riuers that come downe from the hilles of <HI>Saguenay,</HI> and make diuers very dangerous &s;healues in the Sea. At the entrance of tho&s;e two Riuers, we &s;aw many and great &s;tore of Whales, and &s;ea Hor&s;es. Ouer|thwart the &s;ayd Ilands, there is another little Riuer that runneth along tho&s;e marri&s;h groundes about thr&eacute;e or foure leagues, wherein there is great &s;tore of water fowles.
