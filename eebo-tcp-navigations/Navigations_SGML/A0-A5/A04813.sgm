<HEAD>To the Fauourers of the Voyage for <HI>Guiana.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_IN thinges earne&s;tly de&s;ired, though neuer &s;o likelie, we are &s;till &s;u&s;picious: thinking it more credite to our common wi&s;dome, to di&s;credit mo&s;t noble and profitable in|deuours with di&s;tru&s;t; then touch to our valures and &s;afeties to lie wilfullie idle. So that how&s;oeuer an action well and iudiciallie attempted, be e&s;teemed halfe performed: yet, is this my iealous con|ceipt concerning the <HI>Guiana,</HI> that nothing is begun, be|fore all be ended. In this regarde (gentle Reader) I haue pre&s;umed to burthen thine eares, with the weake plea of a good cau&s;e, and in &s;teede of opening it throughlie, to thy prudent con&s;ideration, to note onlie mine own vn&s;atisfied affection: hoping that becau&s;e I do name the <HI>Guiana</HI> vnto thee, thou wilt vouch&s;afe, <HI>hoc nomine,</HI> to vaile and couer all other my defectes in the de&s;erte of a good meaning. In publi&s;hing this treati&s;e, my labour principallie tendeth to this end: to remooue all fig-leaues from our vnbeleefe; that either it may haue cau&s;e to &s;hake off the colourable preten|ces of ignorance: or, if we will not be per&s;waded; that our &s;elfe-wil may re&s;t inexcu&s;able. They that &s;hall applie, and con&s;true this my doing, to &s;erue the Spaniard his turne &s;o well as our owne; in &s;o much as it may &s;eeme to in&s;truct, warne, and arme him: for their &s;atisfaction heerein, they mu&s;t not be ignorant, that his eyes in &s;eeing our &s;hipping there, doe as effectuallie informe him, that manie of our heartes are toward that place: as if it &s;hould bee crediblie aduerti&s;ed, by &s;ome corrupt hireling that we thinke, write and di&s;cour&s;e of nothing els. Neither can I imagine, that to conceale our knowledge herein (which to conceale may perhaps prooue, and bee hereafter taken for wor&s;e then paricide) would be of better purpo&s;e, then to hoodwincke our &s;elues, as who would &s;ay, no man &s;hall &s;ee vs. Be&s;ides:
<PB REF="4">
if the action were whollie to bee effected at her Maie&s;ties charge: then might it at her Highnee&s;&s;e plea&s;ure, be &s;ha|dowed with &s;ome other drift, and neuer bee di&s;couered, vntill it were acted: But &s;ince it craueth the approbati|on and pur&s;es of manie Aduenturers: who cannot be &s;o prodigall, both of their po&s;&s;e&s;sions and liues as voluntarily to run them&s;elues out of breath, in pur&s;uing they knowe not what: great rea&s;on it is, that where a&s;si&s;tance is to be asked, due cau&s;es bee yeelded, to per&s;wade &amp; induce them vnto it. The Spaniard is not &s;o &s;imple, vn&s;etled, and vncertaine in his determinations; as to build them on our breath, or to make our papers his Bulwarkes; nor &s;o &s;lowe, as to expect a pre&s;ident of our forwardne&s;&s;e. His proceedings are &s;uffici|entlie &s;trengthened with the trauailes, reportes, and &s;ub|&s;tanciall proofs of his own men, that haue aboue 60. yeares beaten round about this bu&s;h. And, to &s;ay a truth, the expe|dition that he hath v&s;ed, in &s;ending &s;o manie &s;hips in Fe|bruarie la&s;t, to people this countrey, and di&s;appoint vs: as it doth con&s;equentlie &s;hew, that he findeth his chiefe&s;t force and &s;inewes to con&s;i&s;t in golde: &s;o doth he thereby plainly to our faces exprobate our remi&s;&s;ne&s;&s;e and long deliberati|ons, that in twelue monethes &s;pace haue done, or &s;ought to doe nothing woorthie the ancient fame, and reputation of our Engli&s;h nation, interre&s;&s;ed in &s;o waightie bu&s;ine&s;&s;e<NOTE PLACE="marg">In Iune la&s;t</NOTE> His late proui&s;ion of a new &s;upplie of whole familes to the number of &s;ixe hundred per&s;ons, bound for <HI>Guiana,</HI> but that it plea&s;ed God, that by meanes of that right honourable &s;er|uice mo&s;t re&s;olutelie performed in the &s;ea-fight, and &s;acking of <HI>Cades,</HI> the &s;hips, wherein they &s;hould haue beene conuey|ed, were conuerted into a&s;hes: what might it &s;ignifie? Cer|tes, as it doth euidentlie prooue, that <HI>El Dorado</HI> hath vn|doubted credite and account in their iudgements: &s;o poin|teth it at vs, while&s;t we onlie to entertaine idle time, &s;it li|&s;tening for <HI>Guiana</HI> newes, and in&s;tantlie forget it, as if it were nought els, but a plea&s;ing dreame of a golden fancie.
<PB REF="5">
If we with our &s;elues &s;hall expo&s;tulate, how this commeth to pa&s;&s;e that the aduantage wholie re&s;ting on our &s;ide, in re&s;pect that <HI>Berrec</HI> was this la&s;t yeare beaten out, the coun|try throughlie di&s;couered and the Inhabitantes made de&s;i|rous of her &s;acred Maie&s;ties happie gouernment; they not|with&s;tanding by entring before vs: haue nowe gotten the &s;tart of vs: what may we thinke? &s;hall wee iudge that their natiue country is le&s;&s;e deare, or more weari&s;ome vnto them, then ours is vnto vs? Their <HI>Peruleri</HI> who going bare and emptie out of <HI>Spaine,</HI> do againe within three or foure years returne from <HI>Peru,</HI> rich and in good e&s;tate, do apparantlie di&s;prooue all &s;uch conceipts of them. Shall we &s;ay that they haue more &s;pare men to be imployed in &s;uch actions? It is no &s;ecrete to know the contrarie. Are they &s;ubiect to penu|rie? In all partes of Chri&s;tendome, where money is not &s;cant, all other things are plentifull. Or is their land not able to &s;u&s;tain their numbers of people? They buy many &s;laues to follow their husbandrie, and them&s;elues di&s;daining ba&s;e idlene&s;&s;e, and beggerie, do all honour militarie profe&s;sion, highlie e&s;teeming it, in their mercenaries and &s;trangers. Is it then want of abilitie, in tho&s;e that are willing? lacke of incouragement. Or default of &s;peedie order and direction for tho&s;e that doe voluntarile offer them&s;elues, their &s;ub|&s;tance, and be&s;t indeuour to further this cau&s;e; that ma|keth vs to be thus coated by the Spaniard? The fir&s;t is no que&s;tion. The latter needeth no an&s;were. The profit then by their example to be gathered, is, not to loo&s;e opportu|nitie by delay, or to &s;eeme fearfull and di&s;mayed, where there is no cau&s;e of doubt. For as yet their po&s;t ha&s;t doth no way preiudice our adui&s;ed ley&s;ure in &s;etting forward, &s;ince their preparations of <HI>Negroes</HI> to worke in the mynes, their hor&s;es, cattel, and other nece&s;&s;aries, may, (by the fauour of God) at our fir&s;t comming, both &s;tore vs with quantities of gold oare, and ea&s;e vs of much trouble, paines, and trauaile.

<HEAD>The &s;econd &V;oyage <HI>to Guiana.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_MVnday, the 26. of Ianuary, in the yeer of our Lord 1595 we depar|ted from <HI>Portland</HI> road, in the <HI>Darling</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> hauing in company the Di&s;couerer, a &s;mal Pynnace, whome wee lo&s;t at &s;ea, in foule weather, the Thur&s;day night next following. Fryday, the 13. of Februarie, we fell with the <HI>Canarie</HI> Ilands, where we ex|pected our pynnace, according to our appointment, &s;euen or eight dayes. Here we tooke two boats, the one a pa&s;&s;enger, we bulged, the other wee towed at our &s;hip &s;terne, &s;teering &s;outh &s;outh we&s;t for the Ilandes of <HI>Gap. de Verd.</HI> There hence we &s;et &s;aile the 28. of Februarie, keeping a we&s;t &s;outh we&s;t cour&s;e. In this pa&s;&s;age we found verie &s;mooth &s;eas, faire weather, &amp; &s;teddie winds, blowing ordinarilie between the Ea&s;t, and North ea&s;t pointes. Neere 300. leagues from the&s;e Ilands, we came into a growne &s;ea, the &s;wollen waters ma|king a &s;trange noi&s;e and hurtling together, as if it might be two &s;trong currentes encountring each other. The 12. of March we &s;ounded, and had &s;andie ground in 47. fadam. At midnight in twelue fadam we came to an ancor, the ground &s;andie oa&s;e. Sunday the 14. towardes night, about &s;ome &s;ixe
<PB REF="10">
leagues from the &s;hoar, we de&s;cried a low land in the bottom of a bay. From the 9 of March vntill this time, wee kept for the mo&s;t part a &s;outh &s;outh we&s;t cour&s;e. The water in this place is &s;mooth, but muddie, and the collour red or Tawny. From the we&s;termo&s;t of the <HI>Cap. de Verd.</HI> Ilands vnto this bay I do e&s;timat the di&s;tance to be neer 550. leagues. It &s;emed to mo&s;t of our &s;ea-men to be the verie banke of a &s;hoald vpon a leigh &s;hoare: the rather becau&s;e without it, in the cleane greene &s;ea we had but 7. fadam depth: but after by proofe finding that there is no &s;udden alteration in anie part of the coa&s;t and that the &s;ea is &s;moothe&s;t nere the land, we alwaies at night &s;ought to ancor in three or four fadam. And doubt|le&s;&s;e as the hand of God is woonderfull in all his workes: &s;o heerin his mercifull prouidence is mo&s;t admirable, that vpon a leigh &s;hore, &s;ubiect to a perpetuall ea&s;terlie g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">le, neither much wind can endanger &s;hipping by rea&s;on that the foule heauie water is not capable of vehement motion, and the &s;ofte light oa&s;e, if they touch, cannot brui&s;e them: nor is there anie ieopardie in being wind-bound or imbayed: for the mo&s;t forcible windes make the greate&s;t floud-tydes, whereby the fre&s;hets, when they take their ordinarie cour&s;e of ebbe, doe grow &s;trong and &s;wift, &s;etting directlie off to &s;ea again&s;t the wind. We by turning went cleare of all bayes: howbeit in this ca&s;e, as al&s;o in the riuers, the v&s;e of a droue &s;ayle &s;eemeth a good and readie help. The fir&s;t place wher|in we ancored, was in the mouth of <HI>Arrowa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">,</HI> a faire &amp; great riuer. It &s;tandeth in one degree and fourtie minutes: for we fell &s;o farre to the &s;outhwards by your Lord&s;hips dire|ction. The bar without hath at the lea&s;t three fadam, at the &s;holde&s;t place, when it is low ebb The depth within is eight and ten fadam. The water alwayes bracki&s;h. We found not anie inhabitantes in this place neere the &s;ea coa&s;t. I omit here to recite the names of the nations that are borderers, their townes, Captaines and commodities that their coun|tries doe yeelde, as al&s;o the &s;oundinges, tydes, and how the
<PB REF="10">
coa&s;t lyeth &amp;c. thinking it fitte&s;t to reduce the&s;e di&s;ioyned and &s;cattered remembrances to one place. As we pa&s;&s;ed we alwaies kept the &s;hoare within view and &s;topped the flouds, &s;till ancoring at night in three or foure fadam. When wee came to the north-hed la~d of this bay (which we named <HI>Cape Cecyl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>) we &s;awe two high mountaines like two Ilandes but they ioyne with the mayne. In this tract lying north north-we&s;t neere 60. leagues, there fall into the &s;ea, the&s;e &s;euerall great riuers <HI>Arrowari, Iwaripoco, Maipari, Coanawini, Caipu|rogh.</HI> We ancored in two fadam not far from the&s;e hilles and filled all our caske with fre&s;h water by the &s;hip &s;ide for in the &s;ea 30. miles from the mouth of anie riuer it is fre&s;h and good This &s;econd bay extendeth it &s;elfe aboue 30. leagues to the we&s;tward, &amp; containeth within it the&s;e riuers <HI>Arcooa, Wi+apoco, wanari, Caparwacka, Cawo, Carare, wia, Macuria Cawroor Cura&s;&s;awini.</HI> Here leauing the &s;hip at ancor, I tooke into the boat <HI>Iohn Prouost,</HI> my <HI>Indian</HI> Interpreter, <HI>Iohn Lyn&s;er,</HI> and 8. or nine others, intending to &s;earch &s;ome of the&s;e riuers, and to &s;eeke &s;peech with the <HI>Indians.</HI> In <HI>Wiapoco</HI> at the foot of the Ea&s;termo&s;t mountaine, where the riuer falleth into the &s;ea, we found twentie or thirtie hou&s;es, but not inhabited. Wee &s;tayed there but one night. <HI>Wanari</HI> we ouerpa&s;&s;ed, becau&s;e the entrance is rockie and not deep. In <HI>Capperwacka</HI> we &s;ai|led &s;ome fourtie miles but could &s;ee no <HI>Indian.</HI> At one of their portes vnder the &s;ide of a hill, we took in &s;o much Bra|fill wood as our boat could carie. Among&s;t other trees wee cut downe one for an example, which I doe verilie beleeue to bee the &s;ame &s;orte of Sinamon, which is founde in the &s;treightes of <HI>Magellane.</HI> From <HI>Capurwacka</HI> wee pa&s;&s;ed to <HI>Cawo,</HI> and there met with a <HI>Canoa,</HI> wherein were two <HI>Indi|ans.</HI> It was long time before we could procure them to come neere vs, for they doubted lea&s;t we were Spani&s;h. When my interpreter had per&s;waded them the contrarie, and that wee came from <HI>England,</HI> they without farther &s;peech or delay, brought vs to <HI>Wareo</HI> their Captaine, who entertained vs
<PB REF="11">
mo&s;t frendly: and then at large declared vnto vs, that he was latelie cha&s;ed by the <HI>Spaniard</HI> from <HI>Moruga,</HI> one of the neighbour riuers to <HI>Raleana,</HI> or <HI>Orenoque:</HI> and that hauing burnt his owne hou&s;es, and de&s;troyed his fruites and gar|dens, he had left his countrey and townes to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Arwaccas;</HI> who are a vagabound nation of <HI>Indians,</HI> which finding no certaine place of abode of their owne, do for the mo&s;t part &s;erue and follow the <HI>Spaniardes.</HI> He &s;hewed mee that he was of the nation of the <HI>Iaos,</HI> who are a mightie peo|ple, and of late time were Lordes of all the &s;ea coa&s;t &s;o farre as <HI>Trinidado,</HI> which they likewi&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Howbeit, that with a generall con&s;ent, when the <HI>Spaniardes</HI> fir&s;t began to borrow &s;ome of their wiues: they all agreed to change their habitation, &amp; doe now liue vnited for the mo&s;t part towards the riuer of <HI>Amazones.</HI> But the e&s;peciall cau&s;e of his pre&s;ent remooue was, becau&s;e two or three yeares pa&s;t, twenty <HI>Spa|niardes</HI> came to his towne, and &s;ought to take his be&s;t wife from him: but before they caried her away, hee at time and place of aduantage killed halfe of them: the re&s;t fled, mo&s;t of them &s;ore hurt. Now in this ca&s;e he thought it be&s;t to dwel far ynough from them. Your <HI>Indian</HI> Pilot <HI>Ferdinando,</HI> who conducted you by <HI>Amana,</HI> and now abideth neere the head of <HI>De&s;&s;ekeebe,</HI> is one of this mans &s;ubiects: By whom (as it may &s;eeme) hee hath taken good notice of our Prin|ce&s;&s;e and country. For he de&s;cended more particularlie to inquire what forces were come with vs, a&s;&s;uring me of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> being in <HI>Trinidado,</HI> and that the <HI>Indians</HI> our friends betwixt hope and feare, haue earne&s;tlie expected our return from <HI>England</HI> the&s;e foure or fiue moneths. When I had an|&s;wered him, that at our departure we left no <HI>Spaniards</HI> aliue to annoy them; that we now came onlie to di&s;couer, &amp; trade with them; and that if her Maie&s;tie &s;hould haue &s;ent a power of men, where no enemie was to re&s;i&s;t, the <HI>Indians</HI> might per|haps imagine, that we came rather to inuade, then to defend them. He replyed, that this cour&s;e very well &s;orted with the
<PB REF="11">
report, which they had heard of our Prince&s;&s;e Iu&s;tice, rare graces, &amp; vertues: the fame of who&s;e power in being able to vanqui&s;h the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and &s;ingular goodne&s;&s;e in vnderta|king to &s;uccour and defend the afflicted <HI>Indians,</HI> was now &s;o generall that the nations farre and neere were all agreed to ioyne with vs and by all meanes po&s;sible to a&s;si&s;t vs in ex|pelling and rooting out the <HI>Spaniards</HI> from all partes of the land: and that we were deceiued, if we thought this country not large ynough to receiue vs, without mole&s;tation or in|tru&s;ion vpon the <HI>Indians,</HI> who wanted not choi&s;e of dwelling places, if they for&s;ooke one to liue in another: but &s;tood in neede of our pre&s;ence at all times to aide them, and maintaine their libertie, which to them is dearer then land or liuing. He then farther de&s;ired, that hee with his people might haue our fauour again&s;t the <HI>Arwaccas,</HI> who not be|ing content to enioy their groundes and hou&s;es, had taken from them manie of their wiues and children, the be&s;t of who&s;e fortune was, if they liued, to liue in perpetuall &s;lauerie vnder the <HI>Spaniardes.</HI> Wee put him in good hope and comfort thereof. And he to de&s;erue &s;ome part of this friend&s;hip, commended vnto vs an elderlie man to bee our Pilot in bringing vs to <HI>Raleana.</HI> When we were readie to de|part,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bra&s;il wood</NOTE> he demanded whether we wanted any <HI>Vrapo</HI> which is the wood, that is v&s;ually carried from the&s;e partes to <HI>Trini|dado</HI> in <HI>Canoas,</HI> and is there &s;olde to the <HI>French</HI> for trade: he offered, if we would bring our &s;hip neer his Port; to put in her lading thereof. But becau&s;e mo&s;t of our caske was not yron bound, and in making &s;toage way to remooue it, would haue bene the lo&s;&s;e of our Syder and other drinke; I therefore referred the taking of any quantity to fitter op|portunitie: thinking it &s;ufficient at this time, to haue only my boates lading therof: which afterwardes in extremity of foule weather before we could get aboord our &s;hippe, wee were inforced in a dark nigh to heaue al ouerbord: thinking our &s;elues happy, to haue recouered thither at &s;euen dayes
<PB REF="12">
end, with &s;afety of lyfe onlie. All which time wee could no where &s;et foot on &s;hore, but re&s;ted day and night wet &amp; wea|ther beaten in our couertles boat which was &s;ometimes rea|die to &s;inke vnder vs. For we had in this place without com|pari&s;on more raine, wind, and gu&s;tes then els where at anie time. To be breefe, my men became weake and &s;icke, and if we had &s;tayed anie longer time out, I doubt whether the greate&s;t part of vs had euer come abord again. I afterwards vnder&s;tood by my <HI>Indian</HI> Pilot, that this weather is for mo&s;t part of the yeare v&s;uall neere the Iland <HI>Oncaiarie,</HI> which ly|eth North from the riuer <HI>Capurwacka</HI> &s;ome &s;ixe leagues in|to the &s;ea: and that they hold opinion this Iland to be kept by &s;ome euill &s;pirit: for they verily beleeue, that to &s;leepe in the day time neere it (except it be after much drinke) is pre&s;ent death. The onely &s;ea&s;on wherein little raine doth fall there, is (as I gathered by their &s;peach they diuiding all times by their moones) at our winter Sol&s;tice. The mother winde of this coa&s;t is for the mo&s;t part to the Northwarde of the Ea&s;t, except when the Sunne is on this &s;ide of the E|quinoctiall, for then it often yeares Southerly, but mo&s;t in the night. This our guide is of the <HI>Iaos,</HI> who doe all marke them&s;elues, thereby to be knowne from other nations af|ter this maner. With the tooth of a &s;mall bea&s;t like a Rat, they race &s;ome their faces, &s;ome their bodies, after diuers formes, as if it were with the &s;cratch of a pin, the print of which ra&s;ure, can neuer be done away againe during lyfe. When he had &s;ome time conuer&s;ed with our <HI>Indians,</HI> that went from <HI>England</HI> with vs he became willing of him&s;elfe to &s;ee our country. His &s;ufficiency, tru&s;tines, &amp; knowledge is &s;uch, that if the prete~ded voyage for the <HI>Guiana</HI> do take place, you &s;hall (I doubt not) find him many wayes able to &s;teed your Lord&s;h. in your de&s;ignes &amp; purpo&s;es. For be&s;ides his preci&s;e knowledge of all the coa&s;t, of the <HI>Indian</HI> townes and dwellings, he &s;peaketh all their languages, was bred in <HI>Guiana,</HI> is a &s;worne brother to <HI>Putima,</HI> who &s;lew the <HI>Spani|ards</HI>
<PB REF="12">
in their returne from <HI>Manoa,</HI> can direct vs to many Golde mines and in nothing will vndertake more, then he a&s;&s;uredlie will performe.</P>
<P>To the We&s;tward this bay hath many good roades vnder &s;mall Ilandes, whereof the greate&s;t, named <HI>Gowateri,</HI> is in|habited by the <HI>Shebatos:</HI> and be&s;ides the plentie of foule, fi&s;h fruites wilde Porkes and Deere, which are there to bee had: where <HI>Caiane</HI> falles into the &s;ea, (for it &s;tandeth in the mouthes of <HI>Wia</HI> and <HI>Caiane</HI>) it yeeldes &s;aie and good har|bour in foure and fiue fadam for &s;hips of great burthen. On all that coa&s;t we found not any like it: we therfore honou|red this place by the name of <HI>Port Howard.</HI> The road vn|der <HI>Triangle</HI> Ilands; which are the We&s;termo&s;t from the re&s;t and &s;tand in 5. degrees which haue al&s;o &s;tore of fi&s;h foule, Deere and <HI>Iwanas</HI> is good, but not comparable with this o|ther, where in all windes and weather &s;hippes though they be manie, may all ride &s;ecurelie. The hils and high lands are limits to this bay on each &s;ide: for to the Ea&s;tward beyond it appeare none at all, and to the We&s;tward of Mount <HI>Hob|be&iuml;gh</HI> very few. Where the mountaines faile, there Bra&s;ill wood is no farther to be &s;ought for: but in all partes cotten, pepper, &s;ilke, and <HI>Bal&s;amum</HI> trees do grow in aboundance. The rootes of the herbe <HI>Wiapa&s;&s;a</HI> are here mo&s;t plentifull: I find them in ta&s;te nothing different from good Ginger, &amp; in operation verie medicinable again&s;t the flixe and head|ach. The&s;e riuers, as al&s;o others neerer <HI>Raleana,</HI> do al fal out of the plaines of the Empire ouer rockes, as the riuer <HI>Caroli</HI> doeth into <HI>Raleana:</HI> and in mo&s;t places within the vtmo&s;t hedge of woods, the land within is plaine, voyd of trees; and beareth &s;hort gra&s;&s;e like <HI>Arromaiaries</HI> country.</P>
<P>Next adioyning vnto the&s;e, are the riuers <HI>Cunanamma, &V;racco, Mawari, Mawarparo, Amonna, Marawini, Oncowi, Wiawiami, Aramatappo, Camaiwini, Shurinama, Shurama, Cupanamma, Inana, Curitini, Winitwari, Berbice, Wapari, Maicaiwini, Mahawaica, Wappari, Lemerare, De&s;&s;ekebe, Caopui,

In this variety of goodly riuers, <HI>Amonna</HI> among&s;t the re&s;t poureth him&s;elfe into the &s;ea in a large and deepe channel: his &s;wiftnes &s;uf|fereth no barre, nor refu&s;eth any &s;hipping of what burthen &s;oeuer they be: within his mouth for good and hopefull re|&s;pectes is port <HI>Burley</HI> placed. The inhabitants that dwell Ea&s;tward, doe neuer pa&s;&s;e lower then <HI>Berbice</HI> to trade. A|boue <HI>Curitini</HI> in the woods they gather great quantities of honey. Farther to the Ea&s;tward then <HI>De&s;&s;ekebe,</HI> no <HI>Spaniard</HI> euer trauelled.

I an&s;wered them as before I did the others, that we now came onlie to trade, not knowing vntil this pre&s;ent that any Spaniards wer in the <HI>Guiana;</HI> that vpon our returne our whole Fleete will ha|&s;ten to &s;et forwards, and that in the meane time, we woulde now vi&s;ite our friends and help them &s;o farre as we could in anie thing, that we &s;hould finde needfull pre&s;ently to be done.

euolt from the Spaniard was now in election to bee chiefe commander of all the Indian forces in tho&s;e partes, cannot in pollicie, for <HI>Gualtero</HI> his &s;ake, who&s;e inheritance he &s;ought to v&s;urpe, be a fa&s;t friend vnto vs: that the Spaniards abiding in <HI>Winicapora</HI> (for there were ten) might well before wee could doe any thing, and returne, cau&s;e &s;ome others of <HI>Ber|reo</HI> his men to ioyne with them, in the way to intercept vs: and forethinking withall, that there being no meanes, but by our &s;elues to make known our di&s;couerie, if we returned not; in our misfortune the hope of following this voyage would be buried: but be&s;ides all this, and the re&s;pect of &s;uch &s;pyals, as the Spaniards kept to ob&s;erue our dooings, fore|knowing that if the enemie &s;hould by our lingring &s;top our pa&s;&s;age, which in one or two places of aduantage, fewe of them might ea&s;ilie doe: it would be a que&s;tion how with our &s;hip to get out of the riuer, except fir&s;t wee could remooue them: I thought it be&s;t (all other po&s;sibilities &s;et apart) to &s;eeke in time to bee free from the hazard of the for&s;aid euil pa&s;&s;ages.</P>
<P>While&s;t we were &s;earching at the &s;hore for the <HI>Indians,</HI> my barge took a <HI>Canoa,</HI> with three men in her: the one a &s;eruant to <HI>Berreo</HI> (as before is mentioned,) the other two marchants of <HI>Ca&s;&s;aua.</HI> They had a letter &s;ent from the Gouernour to be coueied to <HI>Trinidado:</HI> which I receiued. There was al&s;o a great hatchet, and twentie kniues, wherewith this <HI>Indian</HI> &s;eruant &s;hould buy a <HI>Canoa,</HI> and hyre Indians to carie her vp the ri|uer towards <HI>Nueuo Reyno.</HI> This <HI>Canoa</HI> for&s;ooth with foure others was to be &s;ent to bring downe <HI>Berreo</HI> his &s;onne with all his forces, which now haue bene I think, full three yeares in preparing, If fiue &s;uch boates be &s;ufficient to conuoy him his men, and all their proui&s;ion: it may &s;eeme, hee commeth with no great &s;trength.</P>
<P>This &s;eruant, as he was a man of e&s;peciall tru&s;t, and neer <HI>Berreo:</HI> &s;o appeared hee to haue &s;ome in&s;ight in his procee|dings. Hee &s;hewed mee that the Indians, who with the&s;e
<PB REF="18">
kniues &s;hould be hired, were to pa&s;&s;e vp &s;o high, as where &s;ome of the <HI>Ca&s;&s;anari</HI> do dwell in &s;mall villages. That <HI>Berreo</HI> his purpo&s;e was, when they came thither to leaue them there, and make them his chiefe Officers ouer the other <HI>Indians:</HI> and in their places &s;ome of the <HI>Ca&s;&s;anari</HI> &s;hould re|turn, who likewi&s;e &s;hould be made Iu&s;tices and Con&s;tables ouer them of <HI>Guiana:</HI> that from <HI>Trinidado</HI> he meant to re|mooue mo&s;t of the old inhabitants, that would be tractable; and interpo&s;e them among&s;t the <HI>Ca&s;&s;anarians</HI> of <HI>Guiana,</HI> and the <HI>Guianians</HI> of the <HI>Ca&s;&s;anari.</HI> That the <HI>Arwaccas</HI> &s;hould wholly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e <HI>Trinidado,</HI> and the riuer &s;ide of <HI>Raleana.</HI> That they alreadie were prouided of three&s;core <HI>Negroes,</HI> to worke the mines in the&s;e places. And that by this meanes <HI>Berreo</HI> hoped to keepe the&s;e &s;euerall nations in mutual en|mitie each again&s;t other, all to &s;erue his turne, and neuer to become &s;trong, or likelie to ioine the~&s;elues again&s;t him. He farther &s;hewed me that <HI>Topiawarie</HI> &s;oone after our depar|ture from the riuer, fled into the mountaines carrying <HI>Hugh Godwyn</HI> with him, and leauing a Sub&s;titute in his countrie, as afore&s;aid: and that the next newes they heard of him was, that he was dead, and the Engli&s;h boy eaten by a Tyger. That the Spaniardes beleeue neither the one, nor the other. That about the end of Iune, when the riuer &s;hall be impa&s;&s;able, the ten &s;hips &s;hall depart from <HI>Trinidado.</HI> And that <HI>Berreo</HI> euer &s;ince his comming to <HI>Guiana,</HI> hath &s;pent his time altogether in purueying of victuals, whereof there is &s;uch &s;car&s;itie, by rea&s;on that the Indians for&s;aking their hou&s;es, haue not this half year planted any of their grounds, that the Spaniards are inforced to &s;eeke their bread far off, and content them&s;elues to liue with little.</P>
<P>In &s;ailing vp the riuer, we pa&s;&s;ed by <HI>Toparimacko</HI> his port, which in one place is verie &s;hoald, the channell lying clo&s;e aboord the &s;hoare. We returned therfore another way by the maine riuer on the South &s;ide: this branch we founde large, deep, and without danger. When we were come nere
<PB REF="19">
<HI>Carapana</HI> his port: he &s;ent fiue or &s;ixe &s;euerall <HI>Canoas,</HI> pro|mi&s;ing this day and the next, that he would come and &s;peak with vs. Thus we lingred &s;ix or &s;euen daies, but he came not. In the end hee &s;ent one of his aged followers, to certifie vs, that he was &s;icke, olde and weake: that the wayes neere his dwelling are not ea&s;ie: and that therefore he de&s;ired vs to hold him excu&s;ed for not comming. This olde man dilated vnto vs, that <HI>Carapana</HI> in hope of our returne, hath euer &s;ince your Lord&s;hips being in that countrie, kept the mountains, where the Spaniards can hardlie anie way inforce him; that they haue taken from him and his people, manie of their wiues, becau&s;e they refu&s;ed to furni&s;h them weekelie with a certaine proportion of bread and victualles: that <HI>Don Iuan</HI> otherwi&s;e called <HI>Eparacano</HI> hath the commandement of all his &s;ubiectes, excepting onelie a choi&s;e guarde of men &s;uffi|cient to keep the place hee now dwelleth in. That it repen|teth him of his ambition, euer to haue &s;ought by the Spani|ards meanes, to haue enlarged his countries and people. For true it is that from the beginning he was a Lord of no other then ordinarie power among&s;t them, vntil he had en|tered into frined&s;hip with <HI>Berreo:</HI> for then the Indians on all &s;ides left &s;ome their habitations, and manie their com|manders to become his &s;ubiectes, that &s;o they might haue the priuiledge to trade with the Spaniards for hatchets and kniues, which are rare iewels of great price among&s;t them. that he now &s;aw no other choi&s;e, but that the <HI>Indians</HI> mu&s;t, if they will doe well, without farther di&s;&s;embling of their nece&s;sitie, either entertaine vs their friends, or els giue place to the Spaniards their enemies. For the plentie of golde that is in this countrie, being now known and di&s;couered, there is no po&s;sibilitie for them to keepe it: on the one &s;ide; they could feele no greater mi&s;erie, nor feare more extremitie, then they were &s;ure to finde, if the Spaniardes preuayled, who perforce doe take all things from them, v&s;ing them as their &s;laues, to runne, to rowe, to be their guides, to carrie
<PB REF="19">
their burthens, and that which is wor&s;t of all, to be content, for &s;aftie of their liues, to leaue their women, if a Spaniard chaunce but to &s;et his eie on anie of them to fancie her: on the other &s;ide; they could hope for, nor de&s;ire no better &s;tate and v&s;age, then her Maie&s;ties gracious gouernment, and princelie vertues do promi&s;e, and a&s;&s;ure vnto them. For, &s;aid he, when the other yeare, we fled into the mountains, and mea&s;uring your doinges by the Spaniardes in like ca&s;e, made no other account, but that your Commander being able, as he was, would doubtle&s;&s;e haue per&s;ecuted vs to the vttermo&s;t, as the onlie maintaineres and &s;upporters of your enemies, and would at the lea&s;t, if hee could not reach vs, take our townes, and make vs ran&s;ome our wiues and children: we found it farre otherwi&s;e, and that none of your well gouerned companie dur&s;t offer any of vs wrong or vi|olence, no not by &s;tealth when vnknowne they might haue done it. We then beleeuing it to be true, that your grand Captaine reported of his Prince&s;&s;e, tooke this for a good proofe of her royall commandement and wi&s;edome, that had framed her &s;ubiects to &s;uch obedience, and of your hap|pine&s;&s;e, that enioyed the benefite thereof: that <HI>Carapana</HI> weighing the good and friendlie cour&s;e of our proceedings, doth humblie craue of her Maie&s;tie for him&s;elf and his peo|ple, that with the re&s;t of the <HI>Indians,</HI> which whollie depende on her princelie regard towards them; hee al&s;o may enioy her fauourable protection, that he doth this, not as a man left vnto him&s;elfe, and for&s;aken by the Spaniards, but as one that knoweth their iniu&s;tice hateth their cruelties, &amp; taketh it fos his be&s;t choi&s;e, vtterlie to di&s;claime their friend&s;hip. It may bee pertinent (as &s;urelie it is a thing worth the noting) to con&s;ider how this pre&s;ident, of your moderation &amp; good order, which to vs &s;eemeth a matter but of &s;mal, and ordina|rie re&s;pect, hath both alienated their hearts altogether from the Spaniard, and &s;tirred vp in them true loue and admi|ration therof. For as gouernment is the only bond of com|mon
<PB REF="20">
&s;ocietie: &s;o to men lawle&s;&s;e, that each one to another are, <HI>Omnes hoc iure mole&s;ti, quo fortes:</HI> To men, I &s;ay, that liue in daylie tumultes, feares, doubtes, &s;u&s;pitions, barbarous cruelties, neuer &s;leeping &s;ecure, but alwaies either drunke, or practi&s;ing one anothers death: to &s;uch men as the&s;e be, who wanting di&s;cipline, iu&s;tice, &amp; good order to confirme them in a quiet and peaceable cour&s;e of liuing knowe not where to find it: the &s;ence and &s;weetne&s;&s;e thereof, is as the dewe of <HI>Hermon:</HI> it is as the harmonie of a well tuned In&s;trument: to be briefe, it carieth in it &s;elfe not onlie a due and worthie commendation; but is auayleable without &s;troke &s;triking to gaine a kingdome. For the <HI>Indians</HI> in all partes within and neere the <HI>Guiana,</HI> doe offer their &s;eruice, and promi&s;e to prouide victuall, and what els their countrie yeeldeth, de|&s;iring onlie that &s;ome force of men may remaine with them, to deliuer them from oppre&s;sion and tyrannie. And now by generall con&s;ent (though hatchets and kniues be the onelie things of reque&s;t and v&s;efull vnto them) they haue agreed by no means to trade with the Spaniard for anie thing. Far|ther, this old man &s;hewed me, whe~ce mo&s;t of their gold co~|meth, that is formed in &s;o manie &amp; diuers fa&s;hions: whence their Spleene-&s;tones, and others of all &s;ortes are to be had in plentie: where gold is to be gathered in the &s;andes of their riuers: from what partes the Spaniards, both by trade, and otherwi&s;e, haue returned much golde. This he vttered with <HI>Carapana</HI> his con&s;ent (I doubt not) hoping thereby to in|duce vs to returne againe. For contrarie to their lawe of &s;ecrecie, which in this ca&s;e they doe all generallie ob&s;erue, &s;harplie puni&s;hing the breakers thereof, as enemies vnto their natiue countrie: I found this man no whit &s;crupulous, but verie free and liberall of &s;peech in all things.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e we might know, that wee &s;hould not want handes or helpe, in this or anie other our enterpri&s;es, if per|haps we &s;hould find cau&s;e to pa&s;&s;e vp to the head of this ri|uer: he declared that the Spaniards haue no Indians to tru&s;t
<PB REF="20">
vnto but &s;ome of the <HI>Arwaccas,</HI> which &s;ince they were not manie could be but of &s;mal force: That the <HI>Charibes</HI> of <HI>Gua|nipa,</HI> the <HI>Crawannas</HI> among&s;t the <HI>Tiuitiuas,</HI> the <HI>Shebaios, Iaos, Amaipagotos, Ca&s;&s;ipagotos, Putpagotos, Samipagotos, Serowos, Etaiguinams, Ca&s;&s;amari,</HI> with the re&s;t of the nations farre and neere, were all readie, on what &s;ide &s;oeuer the Spaniard &s;hal &s;tirre, to fight again&s;t them: that the <HI>Pariagotos,</HI> through who&s;e country they mu&s;t fir&s;t pa&s;&s;e, are alone &s;ufficie~t to in|counter them, &s;uch is the &s;trength of their countrie, and the valure of the men. The Indians hold opinion, that they are notable &s;orcerers, and inuulnerable. In the mountains where they dwell white &s;tones are founde of &s;uch hardne&s;&s;e, that by no arte or meanes they can bee pearced: they imagine that the&s;e <HI>Pariagotos</HI> become inuulnerable, by eating the&s;e &s;tones. The fable omitted, happelie they may prooue good Diamonds.</P>
<P>Then hee &s;hewed howe the <HI>Iwarewakeri</HI> haue nouri&s;hed gra&s;&s;e in all places, where pa&s;&s;age is, the&s;e three yeares, and that it is at this pre&s;ent &s;o high as &s;ome of the trees; which they meane to burne, &s;o &s;oone as the Spaniard &s;hall be with|in danger thereof. La&s;tlie, he &s;hewed mee that <HI>Wariarima|goto</HI> the Emperours chiefe Captaine for tho&s;e partes, hath gathered together manie thou&s;ands of the <HI>Epuremai,</HI> to keep the borders of the Empire; and that hee lay now on the &s;outh &s;ide of the mountaines, &s;ome one dayes iourney, or little more from the Spaniard. To be &s;hort, hee certified me, that they all were re&s;olued not to &s;eeke vpon them (for indeed they feare their &s;hot) but to defend their owne, and to expect our comming. In the meane time they take op|portunities, when they finde anie of them &s;traggling or deuided from their &s;trength, by little &amp; little, to le&s;&s;en their number.</P>
<P>The place, where we were at an ancor was but one daies iourney from <HI>Carapana:</HI> I therefore made motion to this Captaine to &s;taie with two or three of his company aboord
<PB REF="21">
the &s;hip, &amp; to cau&s;e his men to bring me with my Interpre|ter to <HI>Carapana</HI> his dwelling: he an&s;wered that it were not good &s;o to doe, lea&s;t perhaps &s;ome Spie might informe the <HI>Spaniardes</HI> thereof, whereby daunger would growe to <HI>Ca|rapana.</HI> For they haue manie times v&s;ed manie meanes to reconcile him vnto them: but hee from time to time hath dalyed with them, neither profe&s;sing him&s;elfe their enemy, nor in aught &s;hewing them anie friend&s;hip. Now &s;aid hee) if the <HI>Spaniard</HI> &s;hall by anie meanes come to knowledge, that you haue conferred together, they will take this occa&s;i|on to per&s;ecute him with all extremitie, as their open ene|mie, whom they now neglect, or at the lea&s;t feare not as be|ing an harmele&s;&s;e olde man. And for this cau&s;e onelie hath <HI>Carapana</HI> forborne to come vnto you.</P>
<P>By this I perceiued, that to &s;tay longer for him (though gladlie I could haue bene content to &s;pende one &s;euenight more to &s;peake with him) would bee purpo&s;ele&s;&s;e. Where|fore hauing a&s;&s;ured &s;o manie of the <HI>Indians,</HI> as at anie time came vnto vs, of our &s;peedie returne, promi&s;ing them plenty of kniues, beades, and hatchets, if they would re&s;erue their <HI>Ca&s;&s;aua,</HI> and prouide &s;tore of their peeces of golde for vs: I de&s;ired this Captaine to bee a meanes that our friendes of <HI>Trinidado</HI> might vnder&s;tand of our being in the riuer, and that wee meant to releeue them &s;o &s;oone, as conueni|entlie might bee. Hee promi&s;ed in <HI>Carapana</HI> his behalfe, that this &s;hould not be forgotten. One of the Captaines of the <HI>Cyawannas,</HI> who doe now dwell in the riuer <HI>Arawawo,</HI> neere <HI>Trinidado,</HI> vndertooke al&s;o without faile to a&s;certaine them thereof. I was the more carefull herein, becau&s;e &s;o ma|ny &s;hips being there, I doubted lea&s;t they would take order that no <HI>Indian</HI> &s;hould &s;peake with vs. For &s;o indeed it fell out.</P>
<P>This Captain of the <HI>Cyawannas</HI> came likewi&s;e to ioyn with vs, and had prouided fifteen <HI>Canoas</HI> for that purpo&s;e. Their dwelling was lately in <HI>Macureo,</HI> wher the <HI>Spaniards</HI> one night
<PB REF="21">
&s;tealing on them, killed twentie of their men, and burnt their hou&s;es, becau&s;e they refu&s;ed to trade with them for certain images of gold made with manie heades, which they had gotten out of the <HI>Guiana.</HI> I &s;ent a pre&s;ent of Yron to <HI>Cara|pana,</HI> and then &s;et &s;aile.</P>
<P>In turning downe the riuer we &s;pent eight daies. In ma|nie places where the channell lyeth, wee found twentie fa|dam depth: where it is &s;holde&s;t wee had two fadam and a halfe, and that but in one or two places. Of the woorthy|ne&s;&s;e of this riuer, becau&s;e I cannot &s;ay ynough, I wil &s;peak nothing. Wee haue pre&s;umed to call it by the name of <HI>Raleana,</HI> becau&s;e your &s;elfe was the fir&s;t of our nation that e|uer entred the &s;ame, and I thinke it nothing inferiour to <HI>A|ma&s;ones,</HI> which is be&s;t knowne by the name of <HI>Oreliana,</HI> the fir&s;t di&s;couerer thereof. By turning onlie, without helpe of owers, to pa&s;&s;e &s;o long a way, in &s;o &s;horte a time, again&s;t the winde, may &s;ufficiently prooue, that the channell is verie large, good, and likelie to &s;econd our hopes in all that we can de&s;ire. Without the mouth of this riuer, our Pynnace, the <HI>Di&s;couerer,</HI> whome wee lo&s;t neere the coa&s;t of <HI>England,</HI> came vnto vs. She fel with this land &s;omewhat to the South|ward of <HI>Cape Cecyll,</HI> and had &s;pent three weeks and od daies in ranging along&s;t the coa&s;t, when &s;he met with vs. <HI>William Downe</HI> the Mai&s;ter, informed me that they entred, &amp; &s;ear|ched the&s;e foure riuers. In <HI>Wiapoco</HI> they &s;ayled &s;o farre, vntil the rocks &s;topped their pa&s;&s;age. In <HI>Caiane</HI> they went vp one dayes iourny. In <HI>Cunanama</HI> they found manie inhabitants. <HI>Curitini</HI> was the la&s;t riuer they had bene in. Whence, hauing no other means to find <HI>Raleana,</HI> they were inforced to bor|row a Pilot again&s;t his wil: whom afterwards I would haue returned with reward to his contentment; but he would not.</P>
<P>Our Engli&s;h that to &s;teale the fir&s;t ble&s;sing of an vntra|ded place, will perhaps &s;ecretlie ha&s;ten thither, may bee be|holding to me for this caueat, if they take notice thereof. They may be a&s;&s;ured, that this people, as they no way &s;ought
<PB REF="22">
our harme, but v&s;ed our men with all kindne&s;&s;e: &s;o are they impacient of &s;uch a wrong, as to haue anie of their people perforce taken from them, and will doubtle&s;&s;e &s;eek reuenge. The example of the like practi&s;e vpon the coa&s;t of <HI>Ginnie,</HI> in the yeare 1566. and againe at <HI>Dominica,</HI> where Alderman <HI>Wats</HI> his &s;hip hardlie e&s;caped being taken may &s;erue for our warning in like ca&s;e to looke for no good, before they bee &s;atisfied for this iniurie.</P>
<P>When we had taken aboord vs &s;uch victuals as were in the Pynnace: we &s;et fire in her, (for her Rudder could &s;erue her to no longer v&s;e) and &s;topping the flouds, plyed to wind|ward with the ebbe neere the &s;hoare, vntill we were &s;ixteen leagues to the Ea&s;tward of the riuers mouth, and then &s;tan|ding off to &s;ea, we fell in 24. houres &s;ayling with <HI>Punto Gal|lera</HI> the Northea&s;termo&s;t part of <HI>Trinidado.</HI> But hauing <HI>To|bacco</HI> Iland in &s;ight, we fir&s;t went thither. This Iland is plen|tifull of all thinges, and a very good &s;oyle. It is not nowe inhabited, becau&s;e the <HI>Charibes</HI> of <HI>Dominica,</HI> are euil neigh|bours vnto it. They of <HI>Trinidado</HI> haue a meaning and pur|po&s;e to flie thither, when no longer they can keep <HI>Trinida|do.</HI> Their onlie doubt is, that when they are &s;eated there, the <HI>Spaniard</HI> will &s;eeke to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e it al&s;o. The Gouernour of <HI>Marguerita</HI> went latelie in a pynnace to viewe this Iland. <HI>Gilbert</HI> my Pylot who &s;omtime liued there, noteth it for the be&s;t and fruitfulle&s;t ground that he knoweth.</P>
<P>Thence we returned to <HI>Punto Gallera</HI> and ancored in ten fadam vnder the north&s;ide of the Ilande &s;ome fiue or &s;ixe miles from the &s;aid point. The floud-tyde &s;triketh along&s;t the coa&s;t to the Ea&s;tward verie &s;tronglie. Wee di&s;charged a peece of ordinance, and afterwardes went to the &s;hoare in our boat: but no <HI>Indian</HI> came vnto vs. I would haue &s;ent <HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>Trinidado</HI> to procure &s;ome of them to &s;peake with vs: but he was altogether vnwilling, alleadging that their dwellings were farre within the mountaines, and that he knew no part of that &s;ide of the Iland.

but fell with the <HI>Granadas,</HI> which we found not inhabited, S. <HI>Vincent</HI> we hardly recouered by turning vnder the liegh of the Iland. The <HI>Tobacco</HI> of this place is good: but the <HI>Indians</HI> being <HI>Canibals,</HI> promi&s;ing vs &s;tore, and delaying vs from day to day, &s;ought onlie opportunitie to betray, take and eat vs, as latelie they had deuoured the whole companie of a French &s;hip This their treacherie being by one of their &s;laues reuealed, from thencefoorth they did all forbeare to come vnto vs. To &s;it downe on their lowe &s;tooles, when they by offring &s;uch ea&s;e, will &s;eeme to &s;hewe curte&s;ie, abodeth death to &s;trangers, that &s;hall tru&s;t them. At <HI>Matalino</HI> wee found not any inhabitants. La&s;tlie, wee came to <HI>Dominica,</HI> where we could get no good Tobacco. But hauing intelli|gence of a Spani&s;h &s;hip, that was taking in of fre&s;h water, at the northwe&s;t &s;ide of the Iland; we wayed ancor to &s;eek him He de&s;crying vs, &s;tole away by night. The <HI>Indians</HI> of this place haue determined to remooue, and ioyne with them of <HI>Guanipa,</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who lately di&s;peopled one of their Ila~ds, &amp; at our being ther, one of their <HI>Canoas</HI> returned fro~ <HI>Guanipa,</HI> &amp; certified vs, that the ten Spani&s;h &s;hips at <HI>Tri|nidado,</HI> do ride &s;ome of them at <HI>Conquerabia,</HI> the re&s;t at the &s;mall Ilandes neere the difimboging place.

although in a cau&s;e not doubtfull, my allegation is no way needfull: yet becau&s;e the waightine&s;&s;e thereof, and the ex|pectation of others, &s;eemeth of due &amp; right to claime, &s;om|thing to be &s;aid by me whom your e&s;pecial tru&s;t and fauour hath credited and graced with this imployment: Pardon it (I be&s;eech your Honour) if, where my lamp had oile, it bor|row light al&s;o; and my &s;peech, which is altogether vn&s;auo|rie, &s;ea&s;on it &s;elfe with &s;ome of the leauen of your own di&s;|cour&s;e touching this di&s;couerie.

This, if, is nowe cut off through a &s;ingular and incomparable temper, in ouer|comming euill with good: This your &s;econd di&s;couerie hath not onlie found a free &amp; open entrance into <HI>Raleana,</HI> which the Naturals call <HI>Orenoque:</HI> but moreouer yeeldeth choi&s;e of fourtie &s;euerall great riuers (the le&s;&s;er I doe not recken) be|ing for the mo&s;t part with &s;mall ve&s;&s;els nauigable, for our merchants and others, that doe now finde little profit in &s;et|ting foorth for repri&s;all, to exerci&s;e trade in.

al&s;o by the proofes mentioned in the di&s;cour&s;e of the fir&s;t di&s;couery, and &s;ince that, by the <HI>Indians</HI> owne voluntarie re|lations: and la&s;tlie, by the proui&s;ion that the <HI>Spaniardes</HI> doe make to acquite vs thereof. Nece&s;&s;arie it is, as being the onlie help to put a byt in the mouth of the vnbrideled <HI>Spa|niard;</HI> the onlie way to enter into his trea&s;urie of <HI>Nueuo Rey|no,</HI> and <HI>Peru;</HI> the onlie means to animate the wronged <HI>In|dians,</HI> with our a&s;si&s;tance, to &s;eeke reuenge for the extreame murthers and cruelties, which they haue endured, and to ruinate his naked cities in all tho&s;e partes of the Inlande, who&s;e foundations haue beene laid in the bloud of their parents and ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>The forces that the <HI>Spaniard</HI> hath alreadie &s;ent to <HI>Trini|dado,</HI> to fortifie there, and keep the pa&s;&s;age of this riuer, are an euident argument, that the king feareth and doubteth the &s;equele of this di&s;couerie.

&s;elfe to redeeme their tre&s;pa&s;&s;e and offence, how great &s;oe|uer it &s;hould be.</P>
<P>The &s;undry attempts and ouerthrowes of the Spaniards being men of power, and honourable place, in labouring the&s;e 63. yeares, and vpwards to inlarge the kingdome of <HI>Spaine,</HI> with this mightie and great Empire, doe plainlie &s;how, that they long time &s;ought a path, where in one mo|neth a high way was found: that the lo&s;&s;e of their liues wit|ne&s;&s;eth their de&s;ires, &amp; the worthine&s;&s;e of the thing, where to vs the ea&s;ine&s;&s;e of obtaining di&s;crediteth the greatne&s;&s;e of the attempt: and that if now at the la&s;t they doe preuaile, they mu&s;t holde by tyrannie that which they get by the &s;word; where then our returne nothing by the <HI>Indians</HI> is more wi&s;hed for, nothing expected more earne&s;tly.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e obiections, which haue bene made by manie &s;ee|ming wi&s;e, and the impediments likelie to ari&s;e, as they haue &s;uppo&s;ed, are be&s;t an&s;wered by the vnreprooued witne&s;&s;e of the&s;e mens actions. Some haue tearmed the&s;e di&s;coue|ries fables, and fanta&s;ies, as if there had bene no &s;uch land, or territorie: others allowing both of the place, and that &s;uch a kingdome or country is di&s;couered, make conclu&s;ion that if it had beene &s;o rich, as wee haue &s;uppo&s;ed: that no doubt the king of <HI>Spaine</HI> would by this time haue po&s;&s;e&s;t it. But if they con&s;ider that the Spani&s;h-nation hath already conquered the two Empires of <HI>Mexico,</HI> and <HI>Peru,</HI> with &s;o manie other kingdomes and prouinces: wee may very well an&s;were, that his power is not infinite, and that hee hath done well for the time. And yet it is manife&s;t, that this very Empire hath beene by all tho&s;e &s;euerall Spaniards (the ca|talogue of who&s;e names, is by it &s;elfe hereunto annexed) at &s;undrie times vndertaken, and neuer performed. Howbeit, the world hath rea&s;on to admire their con&s;tancie, and their great labours, and we may well blu&s;h at our owne idle, di&s;|pairefull, and loytering di&s;po&s;itions, that can find abilitie in another barren, and &s;terued nation, to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e &s;o much of
<PB REF="25">
the worlde: and can doe nothing but frame argumentes a|gain&s;t our &s;elues as vnfit and powerle&s;&s;e to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e one pro|uince already di&s;couered and of which our nation hath a&s;|&s;urance of the peoples loue, and that all the Chieftaines and principalles haue vowed their obedience and &s;eruice to her Maie&s;tie; the nauigation being withall &s;o &s;hort, dangerle&s;&s;e and free from infectious &s;ickne&s;&s;e. If doubt of perils might moderate the mindes of men once mooued with &s;tedfa&s;t hope, that golde &s;hall be the reward of their trauels: it may ea&s;ilie be perceiued that all tho&s;e lettes and hinderances, that can anie way bee alleadged, or wre&s;ted &s;o much, as but to touch vs, doe deeply and neerelie concerne the Spa|ni&s;h king, and in a manner violentlie with-holde him from that, which he notwith&s;tanding carieth with &s;ucce&s;&s;e, whi|le&s;t we out of &s;ea&s;on, doe affect the bare &s;tyle, to bee named men &s;tayed and circum&s;pect in our proceedings. It is repor|ted, that <HI>Calanus</HI> the <HI>Indian</HI> threw downe before <HI>Alexander</HI> the great, a drie &s;eare peece of leather, and then put his foot on one of the endes of it: the leather being trode downe on that &s;ide, ro&s;e on all partes els. By this the wi&s;e man did &s;hewe vnto him a figure and &s;imilitude of his kingdome, which being exceeding large, mu&s;t of nece&s;sitie in all o|ther partes excepting the place of the kings re&s;idence, bee alwayes ful of &s;tirres, tumults, &amp; in&s;urrections. The end after|wards confirmed, that this Empire con&s;i&s;ting of &s;undry na|tions, could not keep it &s;elfe from di&s;&s;olution. No potentate liuing hath, or can haue &s;o faithful &amp; incorrupt Coun&s;ellers, as be the examples and hi&s;tories of fore pa&s;&s;ed ages. Wee may therefore be bold to thinke that the Gouernours of the Spani&s;h affaires &s;hould mind it, that their kings lu&s;tfull de|&s;ire, and ambicious thoughtes to e&s;tabli&s;h ouer all <HI>Europe</HI> one lawe, one Lord, one religion, are built and erected on a dangerous vngrounded re&s;olution: Con&s;idering that many of the neighbour kingdomes being of equall force in men, or greater then he can make, are &s;etled in a long continued

e&s;tate, are entire within them&s;elues, and hate to heare the voyce of a &s;tranger. It is not vnlikelie that they in this ca&s;e &s;houlde lay before their king the fatall de&s;tinies of manie Worthies, that haue beene con&s;trayned for want of &s;uffi|cient numbers of their naturall &s;ubiectes, after manie yeares &s;pent in the warres, to retyre to their owne coun|tries, and haue bene glad peaceablie to hold their owne Sig|niories at home, re&s;igning all that vnto others, which they haue gotten abroad by hard aduenture, and much effu&s;ion of blood. The King of <HI>Spaine</HI> cannot but di&s;cerne, that his &s;pacious Empires and kingdomes being &s;o manie, and &s;o farre diuided one from another, are like the members of a mon&s;trous bodie, tyed together with cables onlie For take away the trafique of vnnece&s;&s;arie commodities tran&s;ported out of <HI>Spaine:</HI> tho&s;e huge countries of the <HI>Indies</HI> hauing no common linke of affinity, lawe, language, or religion, and being of them&s;elues able to maintaine them&s;elues without forreine commerce, are not &s;o &s;imple, as not to know their owne &s;trength, and to finde, that they doe rather po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e <HI>Spaniardes,</HI> then that they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by them. He cannot be ignorant that <HI>Spaine</HI> it &s;elf is on all &s;ides enuironed with many pui&s;ant enemies, mighty &amp; great princes, who know|ing it to be rich without men, confident without rea&s;on, proud &amp; aduenturous without means &s;ufficient; may happe|lie confederate to cha&s;ti&s;e him, as an in&s;olent intruder, and di&s;turber of all quietne&s;&s;e; and going no farther then <HI>Spaine</HI> it &s;elfe, may euen there &s;hake the foundation of his long con|triued deui&s;es, and in one act redeeme the time, controll his a&s;piring humor, and breake the bandes in &s;under, that im|port &s;eruitude, and &s;ubuer&s;ion to all the dominions of Chri|&s;tendome. Againe, his coun&s;ell may well informe him, that to di&s;people and di&s;able him&s;elfe at home, in hope to ob|taine the <HI>Guiana,</HI> being a countrey &s;trong of it &s;elfe, and defended with infinite multitudes of <HI>Indian</HI> enemies, being rich, and by the inhabitantes offered vnto the Engli&s;h: his

He may be per&s;waded, that to leaue no other &s;uccour or &s;aftie to his nakednes, but the olde, &s;tale practi&s;e of &s;preading rumours, and giuing out fal&s;e intelli|gence of preparations to inuade <HI>England,</HI> thereby to keepe vs at home; or els of hyring and &s;uborning &s;ome <HI>Machaui|lian</HI> vnder hand by &s;ecrete conueyance, to &s;top the cour&s;e of our proceedings; or la&s;tlie, of procuring &s;ome wilde out|law to di&s;quiet our tranquilitie; is but a poore, weake, and vncertaine &s;taie to vphold his e&s;tate by. And yet &s;etting &s;uch like driftes a&s;ide: what can be imagined likelie to hinder vs from preuailing in the <HI>Guiana,</HI> rather then him, who&s;e di&s;ad|uantage it is to be encombred with the &s;elf &s;ame, and mani|fold more impedimentes, then can any way bee &s;uppo&s;ed, with good cau&s;e to impeach, or diuorce vs from &s;o profita|ble an attempt? All this notwith&s;tanding, if the Spani&s;h king not being able to di&s;&s;emble his de&s;ire, or beare the lo&s;&s;e of this one kingdome; putting him&s;elfe out of his &s;trength at home, and expo&s;ing his people to the hazarde of all ca&s;ual|ties abroad, be re&s;olued what&s;oeuer &s;hall happen, not to re|linqui&s;h the <HI>Guiana,</HI> but to keep this one Iron more in the fire, on no other a&s;&s;urance, but a peremptorie di&s;daine of preuention: If he appeare &s;o eagerlie bent for the <HI>Guiana,</HI> as if it were enacted for a lawe among&s;t them&s;elues, <HI>Viis &amp; modis</HI> to thru&s;t for it and not to heare, conceiue, or beleeue anie thing, that may di&s;&s;wade or deter them from the con|que&s;t thereof: It then appertayneth vnto vs, not to inforce tho&s;e obiections again&s;t our &s;elues, which he with le&s;&s;e rea|&s;on reiecteth, as friuolous; &s;ince by how much the more ear|ne&s;t hee is in following this purpo&s;e: by &s;o much the le&s;&s;e
<PB REF="26">
cau&s;e haue we to be diuerted from it. To &s;uch as &s;hall bee willing farther to wade in this argument; fos breuities &s;ake, I doe propo&s;e onlie this bare a&s;&s;ertion: that <HI>England</HI> &amp; the <HI>Guiana</HI> conioyned, are &s;tronger, and more ea&s;ilie defended, then if <HI>England</HI> alone, &s;hould repo&s;e her &s;elfe on her owne force, and poerfulne&s;&s;e. The rea&s;ons that might be inferred to prooue this, need no rationall di&s;cour&s;e: they are all in|timated in the onlie example of <HI>Spaine</HI> it &s;elfe; which with|out the <HI>Indies,</HI> is but a pur&s;e without money, or a painted &s;heath without a dagger. In &s;um: it &s;eemeth vnto me that whereas the difficultie of performing this enterpri&s;e, hath bene produced for a di&s;couragment: it were a dull con|ceipt of &s;trange weaknes in our &s;elues, to di&s;tru&s;t our own power &s;o much; or at lea&s;t, our owne hearts and courages; as valewing the Spani&s;h nation to be omnipotent; or yeelding that the poore <HI>Portugall</HI> hath that mai&s;tering &s;pirite, and conquering indu&s;trie, aboue vs; as to be able to &s;eat him|&s;elfe among&s;t the manie mighty princes of the Ea&s;t <HI>Indies,</HI> to frontier <HI>China,</HI> to holde in &s;ubiection the <HI>Philippines, Zei|lan, Calecut, Goa, Ormus, Mozambique,</HI> and the re&s;t; the na|uigation being &s;o tedious and full of perill: to &s;uffer our &s;elues to be put backe for worthle&s;&s;e cyphers, out of place, without account. All which Regions being now al&s;o by the late conque&s;t of <HI>Portugall,</HI> entituled to the Spani&s;h king: to whome the <HI>Colenies</HI> of tho&s;e partes doe yet generallie re|fu&s;e to &s;weare fealtie and allegeance: and the care depen|ding on him, not onlie of gouerning them in the Ea&s;t, &s;o farre off; but al&s;o of ordering and &s;trengthening of tho&s;e di&s;vnited, &s;cattered, and ill guarded Empires and prouin|ces in the We&s;t: It might verie well be alleadged to the &s;aid Spani&s;h king, that it were more wi&s;edome for him to a&s;&s;ure and fortifie &s;ome part of tho&s;e already gotten then to be|gin the conque&s;t of <HI>Guiana,</HI> &s;o farre &s;eperate from the re&s;t of his <HI>Indies:</HI> in which he hath had &s;o manie misfortunes, and again&s;t whome the naturall people are &s;o impetuou&s;lie

<DIV2 TYPE="to the reader">
<HEAD>An aduerti&s;ment to the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>IN this Breuiarie, the names onlie are compri&s;ed of &s;uch as being led with the generall fame of <HI>Guiana,</HI> haue endeuoured to di&s;couer &amp; po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;e it. The whole hi&s;tories are long and cannot &s;uddenlie be tran&s;la|ted, or Engli&s;hed at large, as we in the&s;e Elegies find them. It may per|haps &s;eeme &s;trange and incredible, that &s;o manie Caualeros &s;hould all faile in this one attempt, &s;ince in many partes of the Indies, far &s;maller numbers in &s;horter time haue performed as great matters, and &s;ubdued mightie Kingdoms: I haue therefore thought it good, here to alleadge tho&s;e rea&s;ons, which by circum&s;tance may be gathered to haue beene chief impediments to the Spaniard in this intended &s;earch &amp; conque&s;t.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t may be the remotene&s;&s;e or di&s;tance of their places of <HI>Ronde|vow,</HI> from the <HI>Dorado:</HI> which appeare to be foure, <HI>Nueuo Reyno:</HI> the mouth of <HI>Amazones</HI> or <HI>Oreliano. Cubagua,</HI> or the coa&s;t of the <HI>Carackas:</HI> &amp; <HI>Trinidado.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. From <HI>Moisbanda,</HI> where <HI>Oreliano</HI> hath his head-&s;pring to his mouth the Spaniards account it 2000. leagues. <HI>Raleana</HI> ri&s;eth neere the &s;aide mountaines in <HI>Moiabanda,</HI> and tributeth his waters to the &s;ea, not farre from the other: <HI>Guiana</HI> is enuironed with the&s;e two fre&s;h water &s;eas, wher their di&s;tance is greate&s;t from their ri&s;inges, and is be&s;ides guarded with impa&s;&s;able mountains, which in clo&s;e &amp; defend it on al partes, excepting <HI>Topiawaries</HI> country. It is no maruel then, if the vigor, heat, &amp; life of tho&s;e Spaniards, who &s;ought it from <HI>Nueuo Reyno,</HI> were allayed and &s;pent, be|fore they came nere it in tho&s;e long, de&s;olate, and vncomfortable waies.</P>
<P N="2">2. From <HI>Cubagua</HI> to &s;eek it by &s;ea, in ve&s;&s;els of any burthen, is a worke of farre greater labour, then to &s;aile directly from <HI>Spaine.</HI> And to pa&s;&s;e
<PB REF="33">
ouerland is a matter of great difficultie, by rea&s;on that the Indian Nati|ons inhabiting between the coa&s;t of the <HI>Carackas</HI> and <HI>Guiana,</HI> being wea|ried and harried with the daylie incur&s;ions of the Spaniards, haue now turned their abu&s;ed patience into furie, refu&s;ing to &s;uffer any forces of men to be led through their countries. For the Spaniards trauelling in tho&s;e parts, when they found not golde an&s;werable to their expectation, ouerlaid them with cruelties, tyrannie, and thraldom: forbearing neither men, women friends, nor foes. Which maner of dealing, though in &s;ome &s;ort it &s;atisfied their de&s;ire of pre&s;ent profit: yet hath it otherwi&s;e done them much harme in hardening and driuing tho&s;e nations to de&s;perate re&s;olutions.</P>
<P N="3">3 From the mouth of <HI>Oreliano</HI> to &s;eeke entrance with any number of men, and to bore a hole through the mountaines, is all one. Neither find we, that any &s;eeking it that way, haue at anie time boa&s;ted of their gaines or plea&s;urable iourneyes.</P>
<P N="4">4 From <HI>Trinidado</HI> as the cour&s;e is &s;horte&s;t: &s;o doth it promi&s;e be&s;t like|lihood of &s;ucce&s;&s;e. Howbeit, impo&s;&s;ible it is with any ve&s;&s;ell of ordinarie burthen by that way to recouer the riuer of <HI>Raleana.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;econd. The Spaniards haue bene &s;o far from furthering and hel|ping on another, or admitting partners or coadiutors in the <HI>Guiana</HI> cau&s;e that among&s;t &s;o many attempts, from the beginning to the la&s;t, I cannot find any one, when they were otherwi&s;e liklie&s;t to preuaile, free from di&s;|cords, mutinies, and cruel murders among&s;t them&s;elues.</P>
<P>Thirdly. The Spaniards in this place haue mi&s;t that aduantage, which els where hath &s;teeded them in all their conque&s;ts: namelie, the di&s;&s;enti|tions and mutuall warres of the Indians among&s;t them&s;elues, Which of what force it is, may be gathered by the example of <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">awcania</HI> in <HI>Peru.</HI> For the Indians of that one prouince containing in circuit not aboue 20. leagues, haue maintained warres aboue the&s;e 30. yeares, again&s;t all the Spaniards, and in de&s;pight of them haue kept their own countrie, often|times di&s;comforting their enemies in many &s;et battayles, burning &amp; de|&s;troying &s;ome of their &s;tronge&s;t townes. The chiefe rea&s;on wherof I take to be, becau&s;e no Indian nation was enemy vnto them. And how&s;oeuer the Spaniards vaunt of their redoubted exploits in the Indies: yet do their owne writings in effect te&s;tifie, that without the aid of the Indians diuided among&s;t rhem&s;elues, <HI>Mexico, Peru,</HI> and the re&s;t, had neuer bene Spani&s;h.</P>
<P>La&s;tly. I can impute it to no cau&s;e &s;o rightly, as immediately to the di|uine prouidence. For by him princes raigne. And in my beleefe (except we will looke to be warned by miracle from heauen,) we need no far|ther a&s;&s;urances, then we already haue to per&s;wade our &s;elues that it hath plea&s;ed our God of his infinit goodne&s;&s;e, in his will and purpo&s;e to ap|point and re&s;erue this Empire for vs.</P>
