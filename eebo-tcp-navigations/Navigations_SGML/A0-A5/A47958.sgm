<P>They cho&s;e twelve reformers for making new Laws,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laws concern|ing the Doge.</NOTE> the fir&s;t of which was, that the Duke or Doge &s;hould continue but two years in office, that his Govern|ment &s;hould expire on the la&s;t of <HI>December.</HI> And that his authority might be the more &s;tinted, it was added, that he could not be con|tinued; that after that day he &s;hould have no Power; that none of his Name and Family &s;hould be cho&s;en immediatly after him, and

<P>The <HI>Government</HI> of <HI>Genoa</HI> con&s;i&s;ts of two Councils, the one called the great Council,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two Councils in <HI>Genoa.</HI></NOTE> and the other the lit|tle, in both which the Doge Head of the Republick pre&s;ides, who, as hath been &s;aid, is changed every two years, and hath always for his a&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ors twelve Senators, eight Procu|rators, and tho&s;e who have carried the &s;upream Dignity of Doge.</P>

<P>I have told you that for pre&s;i|ding in tho&s;e two Councils, the Doge had for A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors twelve Se|nators and eight Procurators: They continue in Office two years, and every Six Months three Senators and two Procurators are &s;ub&s;titu|ted in the Place of tho&s;e that go out; the Election being performed in this manner.</P>

All the&s;e Granaries together can hold a &s;ufficient quantity of Corn to &s;upply the Town for three years; and as one is empti|ed, another is filled; with this prudent care, that if it be a plen|tiful year and the Corn cheap, the Granaries are filled double: and if the year be barren, and the Corn very dear, they &s;pend the time with the former Provi&s;ion,
<PB N="74" REF="40"> and wait till the following year to fill them again: So that it is not to be thought &s;trange, if by &s;o wi&s;e a conduct the Bread is no dearer at one time than at ano|ther; the People being never &s;en|&s;ible of the barrenne&s;s of the Earth, which by divine Providence hath never for two years together refu&s;ed to man his &s;u&s;tenance.</P>
<P>Out of the&s;e publick Grana|naries all the Bakers are obliged to buy their Corn, with which they &s;upply the people with bread: and they are prohibited under &s;evere Penalties to buy it el&s;ewhere.

<P>Others there may be, of which I have not been informed.</P>
<P>The Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e is always provided of all &s;orts of Commo|dities, as Silk, Sugars, Spice, cloth of Gold, &s;ilken and wool|len Stuffs, and of every thing that nece&s;&s;ity or luxury requires.</P>
<P>The Port is much frequented by <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> who trade
<PB N="91" REF="48"> with the City of <HI>Genoa,</HI> in Silks, Oil, Velvet, Damask, Honey, Wax, and Commodities of the <HI>Levant.</HI></P>
<P>The mo&s;t con&s;iderable Forts of the <HI>Terra firma</HI> or main Land are <HI>Savona, Gavi, Sarzana,</HI> and the Fort St. <HI>Marie,</HI> in the Gulf <HI>delle Spetie;</HI> and in <HI>Cor&s;ica</HI> they have <HI>Calvi, Boniface,</HI> and <HI>Aiazzo;</HI> but the whole State hath not both by Sea and Land &s;ix hun|dred Piece of bra&s;s Cannon.</P>
<P>The Gari&s;on of <HI>Genoa</HI> exceeds not two thou&s;and five hundred Men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This was writ|ten before <HI>Genoa</HI> was Bombed by the <HI>French.</HI></NOTE> who have never &s;een the fire of an Enemy nor a Mortar-piece play; its Walls towards the Land &s;ide and Mountains, are two <HI>French</HI> Leagues in extent, they make a double enclo&s;ure, of which the outermo&s;t is almo&s;t wholly cut out of the Rock, but the Ditch of it is narrow and &s;hal|low, and the Covert-way is &s;o far from being large, that two
<PB N="92" REF="49"> Men cannot pa&s;s it a brea&s;t, be|&s;ides that the Works which de|fend the Town, the Gates and Po&s;ts which of nece&s;&s;ity mu&s;t be furni&s;hed, require as many to defend it, as are nece&s;&s;ary to at|tack the &s;ame.</P>
<P>In bringing &s;uccours from the <HI>Milane&s;e,</HI> there is a nece&s;&s;ity of marching through a great many narrow pa&s;&s;es, in the Mountains that divide their States, and two or three thou&s;and Dragoons po&s;t|ed in the avenues of the&s;e Pa&s;&s;es, would be enough to hinder all relief: Men may land not onely without Mu&s;quet &s;hot, but it is ea&s;ie for them al&s;o in landing to lodge under Covert, either on the &s;ide of <HI>Bizagne,</HI> or on the &s;ide of S. <HI>Peter des Arenes.</HI> Batteries may be rai&s;ed betwixt the <HI>Fanal</HI> and the new Mole without the reach of any a&s;&s;ault, which would bat|ter down the City on all &s;ides; be&s;ides, there is nothing more
<PB N="93" REF="49"> ea&s;ie, than to cut the Aqueducts which make the <HI>Milns</HI> to go and furni&s;h the City with fre&s;h water, &s;o that the People without Bread and Water, &s;tarved with hunger and thir&s;t, would quickly cry for Peace, the whole City is al&s;o full of common Sewers and &s;ubterra|nean Vaults which di&s;charge them&s;elves into the Sea, and no|thing hinders but Mines and o|ther Engines may be made to play, which would overthrow the Walls that cro&s;s tho&s;e Sewers, and make in them as many breaches as might be thought fit: from whence it may be conclu|ded that that City is &s;upported more by its name, haughtine&s;s, and outward appearance, than by any &s;olid &s;trength.</P>
<P>That Republick then, though exceeding rich, is notwith&s;tand|ing in it &s;elf very weak for two rea&s;ons: Fir&s;t, Becau&s;e the pro|found Peace it hath for a long
<PB N="94" REF="50"> time enjoyed, has inured the People to &s;oftne&s;s and luxury; and &s;econdly, becau&s;e though the private Per&s;ons be extreme weal|thy, yet the Revenues of the State are but very moderate, and it is no ea&s;ie matter in Common-wealths to impo&s;e new Taxes for defraying the charges of War, which always di&s;plea&s;es the Peo|ple who are naturally inclined to re&s;t. But to remedy this weak|ne&s;s which the <HI>Genoe&s;e</HI> them&s;elves are &s;en&s;ible enough of, they are &s;o &s;traitly linked in Intere&s;t with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that they will al|ways be &s;upported with all the Forces of that Kingdom. That &s;trict Alliance is founded not onely, on what I have already &s;aid, of the great E&s;tates which the <HI>Genoe&s;e</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;s in the Terri|tories of the Catholick King; but al&s;o becau&s;e the <HI>Milane&s;e</HI> borders upon the States of <HI>Ge|noa;</HI> and that <HI>Final,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Final.</NOTE> which be|longs
<PB N="95" REF="50"> to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> is a place apart, and &s;ituated betwixt <HI>Al|begnao</HI> and <HI>Savona,</HI> in the middle of the States of this Republick, which inviron it on all hands: &s;o that <HI>Milan</HI> can have no commu|nication with that important Maritime place, but by pa&s;&s;ing through the Lands of <HI>Genoa,</HI> which are bordered on the We&s;t by the Mountains of <HI>Piemont;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The limits of the State of <HI>Genoa.</HI></NOTE> on the North by <HI>Montferrat</HI> and the <HI>Milane&s;e;</HI> on the Ea&s;t by the States of the Dukes of <HI>Florence</HI> and <HI>Parma;</HI> and on the South, by the Sea of <HI>Liguria.</HI></P>
<P>Some time before the <HI>Pyrenean</HI> Peace, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> fearing that the <HI>French</HI> might &s;eize <HI>Final,</HI> propo&s;ed to &s;ell it to the <HI>Genoe&s;e:</HI> the price was agreed upon;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Genoa</HI> bar|gains for <HI>Final.</HI></NOTE> but the Marque&s;s <HI>de los Balbaces</HI> a Grandee of <HI>Spain</HI> of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Spinola,</HI> as a faithful Subject, preferring the Intere&s;t of the King he &s;erved, before that of his own
<PB N="96" REF="51"> Country, oppo&s;ed it. He was Coun&s;ellour of State for the Af|fairs of <HI>Italy,</HI> and with much vigour and &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s he repre|&s;ented, that if <HI>Final</HI> were aban|doned, and the <HI>Genoe&s;e</HI> &s;hould afterwards break with <HI>Spain,</HI> it would be impo&s;&s;ible to &s;end re|lief in to the <HI>Milane&s;e:</HI> but that if the <HI>Genoe&s;e</HI> &s;hould abandon <HI>Spain,</HI> relief might always be &s;ent by <HI>Final,</HI> and <HI>Montferrat,</HI> with|out being obliged to them. His rea&s;ons were good, becau&s;e at that time <HI>Montferrat</HI> was not in the hands of the <HI>French:</HI> but if at pre&s;ent <HI>Genoa</HI> abandoned <HI>Spain, Milan</HI> would be without relief; becau&s;e to go from <HI>Final</HI> to <HI>Mi|lan, Montferrat</HI> being &s;hut, there is a nece&s;&s;ity of pa&s;&s;ing through the State of <HI>Genoa.</HI> The advice of <HI>Los Balbaces</HI> was followed:<NOTE PLACE="marg">And is di&s;ap|pointed.</NOTE> the Treaty of <HI>Final</HI> was broken off; and the <HI>Genoe&s;e</HI> thereupon conceived &s;o great indignation
<PB N="97" REF="51"> again&s;t <HI>Balbaces</HI> their Country|man, that they deprived him of all his priviledges, which were to go with his Servants armed, to have the Cu&s;hion at Church, and to be vi&s;ited by the Nobility without the permi&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Doge:</HI> which obliged him whol|ly to renounce <HI>Genoa,</HI> and to &s;ettle in <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Final</HI> then, is one of the chief links that unites <HI>Genoa</HI> with the Catholick King. Neverthele&s;s, what Efforts &s;oever <HI>Spain</HI> makes in favour of that Republick, yet it can give them but very mode|rate a&s;&s;i&s;tances by Land; becau&s;e it can onely help them with the Forces of the <HI>Milane&s;e</HI> which it dares not ungari&s;on. But by Sea it can defend them with all the Galleys of the Squadrons of <HI>Naples, Sicily, Sardinia</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI> So that provided a powerful Prince who intended to attack <HI>Genoa,</HI> had a Fleet &s;trong enough
<PB N="98" REF="52"> to give a check to the Naval forces of <HI>Spain,</HI> it would be ea&s;ie for him by <HI>Piemont</HI> and <HI>Montferrat</HI> to a&s;&s;ault that Republick by Land, and in a &s;hort time to triumph over its pride, with a &s;maller number of men than one may imagine; and &s;o much the rather that Commerce being the Soul of that Republick, a Fleet crui&s;ing before their Harbours, would no &s;ooner interrupt their Trade, but that the People and Artificers would be reduced to extremity; be&s;ides that <HI>Genoa,</HI> the Country furni&s;hing but very little Corn, is obliged to &s;upply it &s;elf from <HI>Sicily</HI> and <HI>Africa</HI> by Sea; and that finding them&s;elves be&s;ieged by Land, and blocked up by Sea, with little relief from the Forces of the <HI>Milane&s;e,</HI> and out of con|dition of being revictualled from any where el&s;e, it would quickly be reduced to the la&s;t pinch, ha|ving but very few &s;tanding Sol|diers,
<PB N="99" REF="52"> and the Militia of the Coun|try altogether undi&s;ciplined.</P>
<P>But if the Nobility as well as People of <HI>Genoa,</HI> could be once cleared of the fal&s;e notions they have conceived of a Government contrary to that under which they live; if once they could be per&s;uaded that the Republican yoke gives in&s;tead of one lawful Ma&s;ter, an hundred in&s;atiable Tyrants, that it is a <HI>Hydra</HI> of many Heads, which &s;eldom agree in their re&s;olutions; that a King governs alone, in imitation of the Deity; whereas popular A&s;|&s;emblies are for the mo&s;t part but a confu&s;ed <HI>Babylon;</HI> that by an inclination of Nature which tends always to perfection, all Repub|licks &s;oon or late terminate in a Monarchy, as heretofore <HI>Rome,</HI> and <HI>Florence</HI> in later days furni&s;h the <HI>Genoe&s;e</HI> with almo&s;t a dome|&s;tick in&s;tance: if they would al&s;o call to mind that they freely
<PB N="100" REF="53"> gave them&s;elvs over to <HI>Charles</HI> VI. and his Succe&s;&s;ours upon condi|tions religiou&s;ly ob&s;erved on the part of our Kings, who by con|&s;equent are their true and lawful Sovereigns: If to all the&s;e Rea|&s;ons, they added &s;erious refle|ctions upon the incomparable Virtues of the greate&s;t King that ever <HI>France</HI> had; and that touch|ed with a remor&s;e for a revolt that made them &s;hake off his Dominion, they would &s;incerely return under his Royal Protecti|on, to what pitch of grandeur might not that rich Republick advance? what Traffick might not the <HI>Genoe&s;e</HI> a&s;pire to, under the triumphant banner of <HI>France?</HI> and what <HI>Cor&s;aires</HI> dur&s;t appear in the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> when our Squadrons joined to twenty Gal|leys that <HI>Genoa</HI> might entertain, &s;hould crui&s;e from <HI>Europe</HI> to <HI>A|frica</HI> again&s;t the&s;e infe&s;ters of the Seas?</P>
<PB N="101" REF="53">
<P>I &s;ay that <HI>Genoa,</HI> which com|monly &s;ends out but &s;ix Galleys, might ea&s;ily maintain not onely twenty, but al&s;o &s;ix men of War at lea&s;t; to convey their Merchant Ships, if that Republick were again under the protection of the Kings of <HI>France:</HI> for &s;eeing then they could have no cau&s;e to fear a War from their Neighbours, all their Revenues might be wholly employed in Navigation, that they might become Ma&s;ters of all the Trade of the <HI>Mediterra|nean,</HI> and &s;ucce&s;sfully carry it on as far as the Ea&s;t and We&s;t <HI>Indies.</HI> And as the Nobles of <HI>Genoa</HI> are extraordinarily rich, and have no le&s;s Wit and Courage than Wealth, what employments might not they render them&s;elves capable of under a King, who with wonderful exactne&s;s knows how to di&s;cern the merit of his Sub|jects, and who would furni&s;h them with continual occa&s;ions of cul|tivating
<PB N="102" REF="54"> a <HI>genius,</HI> that is da&s;tar|dized by plea&s;ures, and of em|ploying a Courage, which by an unactive Peace langui&s;hes in idle|ne&s;s? The principal Dignities of the State, the highe&s;t Commands in the Army the con&s;iderable Of|fices of the Kingdom, would be as much the recompences of their merit, as of their &s;incere &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ions; and it would be a plea&s;ant thing to &s;ee them &s;hare in the good fortune and glory of a State, who&s;e Intere&s;ts would go hand in hand with their own. <HI>Genoa</HI> and <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> united under the Standard of the <HI>Flower-de-luce,</HI> would give the Law from <HI>Cadiz</HI> to the <HI>Dardanelles,</HI> keep all <HI>Barbary</HI> in awful re&s;pect, and make the <HI>Sul|tan,</HI> tremble even in the <HI>Seraglio</HI> of <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> The Trea&s;ures of the <HI>Ligurians,</HI> would daily in|crea&s;e by the free Trade that they might have in their own hands: and that great Commerce draw|ing
<PB N="103" REF="54"> into the Coffers of the King's Subjects all the Money of <HI>Europe,</HI> would render his own the more inexhau&s;tible for the enlarge|ment of that high Power to which his Virtues buoyed up by extraordinary fortune have rai&s;ed him. May Heavens grant that that invincible Monarch may reunite to his Crown that pre|cious Flower, which a revolt heretofore &s;truck out of it, and that <HI>Louis the Great</HI> and the <HI>Ge|noe&s;e</HI> may contend who &s;hall have the better on't; he by Clemency, and they by profound Submi&s;|&s;ions.</P>
