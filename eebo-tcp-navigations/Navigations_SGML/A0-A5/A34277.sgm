<HEAD>A Congratulatory Poem, Dedicated to his Excellency, the <HI>Amba&s;&s;ador,</HI> from the Emperor of <HI>Fez,</HI> and <HI>Morocco.</HI></HEAD>
<L>SErene SIR, you'r Welcome to the Nation,</L>
<L>A Man of Honour, and Splendid in your &s;tation;</L>
<L>Who&s;e noble worth, and ever-matchle&s;s Fame,</L>
<L>Does cau&s;e the vulgar to applaud the &s;ame.</L>
<L>Had th' <HI>Indian</HI> King no other Man to &s;end</L>
<L>But th'Duke his Brother, and his Natural Friend?</L>
<L>Surely this love it mu&s;t be reckoned high</L>
<L>By us, pretenders to Civility;</L>
<L>Should we not render good for good, when we</L>
<L>(Nay, all the World) knows your Conformity:</L>
<L>Therefore to be uncivil to a Stranger,</L>
<L>Is like to a Dog &s;narling in a Manger:</L>
<L>For, &s;aies the Philo&s;opher, an untaught Man</L>
<L>Flies off from Nature, and from Rea&s;on &s;trong;</L>
<L>He's wor&s;e then the Bea&s;ts in doing &s;o ill,</L>
<L>For they act according to their Species &s;till:</L>
<L>So that an ignorant and rude Man's but at be&s;t,</L>
<L>A kind of Manly unmannerly Bea&s;t;</L>
<L>To affront a &s;tranger out of his Country dear,</L>
<L>That out of love comes to us about <HI>Tangier:</HI></L>
<L>I do prote&s;t it was &s;o wondrous rude,</L>
<L>That nothing could do it but th'multitude,</L>
<L>A &s;ort of Bea&s;ts that knows nothing but to Eat</L>
<L>And Drink, be drunk, and then lye down and &s;leep.</L>
<L>Wi&s;e Men and of under&s;tanding high,</L>
<L>Were angry at the Multitudes folly:</L>
<L>Whil&s;t Noble <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>-men &s;uch crimes dete&s;t,</L>
<L>And &s;corn to bear &s;uch thoughts within their brea&s;t:</L>
<L>Ignorance is &s;o great a Mon&s;ter, 'tis begot</L>
<L>Only by Eating, and by the idle Pot;</L>
<L>Whereas Men of Learning and pruden<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;till,</L>
<L>Are civil to <HI>Amba&s;&s;adors,</HI> 'tis their will:</L>
<L>A rude Man is no Man, but a Gla&s;s Bottle,</L>
<L>According to the Precepts of <HI>Ari&s;totle:</HI></L>
<L>So tho&s;e that affronted you are really none</L>
<L>But Flies, and Fleas, and Scare-Bees of the Sun:</L>
<L>Like Fi&s;h with &s;pringing Tides come up in Shoals,</L>
<L>And night draws on the play of Batts and Owls:</L>
<L>So may the Rabble fitly compared be</L>
<L>To the&s;e poor Creatures of &s;tupidity:</L>
<L>Therefore pray Sir, let it all pa&s;s over,</L>
<L>And don't Record it with your good Red Oker.</L>
<L>You are a Hor&s;e-man good, a Marks-man &s;traight,</L>
<L>The like it has never been &s;een of late;</L>
<L>With throwing of a Dart up to the Sky,</L>
<L>Catching it again, when falling from on high,</L>
<L>And with his Launce he runs it through a Ring,</L>
<L>Performing of that beyond any thing;</L>
<PB REF="2">
<L>And at a large, di&s;tance his Javelin lets flye,</L>
<L>And &s;hoots a Man in order for to dye:</L>
<L>Thus is he accompli&s;h'd in the Arts mo&s;t high,</L>
<L>Of &s;wift, Hor&s;man &s;hip, and good Archery&punc;</L>
<L>Which pleas'd the King &s;o extreamly, well,</L>
<L>Quoth he where's the Man that can this parallel:</L>
<L>Be&s;ides <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 chunk">ead your Noble Speech,</L>
<L>Enough a great Chri&s;tian for to teach.</L>
<L>Shewing though you'r dark without, you'r Fair within&punc;</L>
<L>Innocence in action is the beauty of each thing;</L>
<L>And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 word"> demons&s;trated to us from Nature's Eye;</L>
<L>The Star <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 word"> brighte&s;t in the Cloudie&s;t Sky,</L>
<L>A Metaphor for your Exceliency high,</L>
<L>Nature's great Wonder in Epitomy.</L>
<L>We thank you therefore for your Vi&s;it fine,</L>
<L>And as a Star in Friend&s;hips Orb doth &s;hine:</L>
<L>Glisten <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 word"> you go to your own Country dear,</L>
<L>And part with poor <HI>Englands</HI> Hemi&s;phere;</L>
<L>And when you'r gone, this we will proclaim,</L>
<L>You left behind you a &s;weet and Ro&s;ie Name:</L>
<L>Ab&s;ence in love it is a kind of Death.</L>
<L>Before we do de&s;cend to Mother-Earth:</L>
<L>Life's but an Emba&s;&s;ie, having been heard,</L>
<L>What's to be done, and what to be learn'd;</L>
<L>It is then gone, and &s;o vani&s;hes away,</L>
<L>As Mi&s;ts are lo&s;t upon a Rainy day;</L>
<L>Till the Sun breaks out afre&s;h and agen,</L>
<L>To chear the hearts of all the Sons of Men:</L>
<L>Teaching how fir&s;t we live, and then we dye,</L>
<L>And &s;o go off to all Eternity.</L>

<L>To <HI>White-Hall,</HI> the Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>Morooco;</HI></L>

<L>And each fine Lord deck'd up with Golden lace;</L>
<L>From thence he went into <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall,</HI></L>

<L>With all agility without the lea&s;t delay,</L>
