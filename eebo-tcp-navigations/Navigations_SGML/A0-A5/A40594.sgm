<HEAD>A FULL and TRUE RELATION OF THE GLORIOUS VICTORY OF THE <HI>CHRISTIANS</HI> over the <HI>T&V;RKS.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>THe Amazing Progre&s;&s;es of the Imperial Arms, being the Pre&s;ent Entertainment of the World, and having as yet had no good Ac|count of their Source, which was the late Great Victory over the</HI> Turks, <HI>We pre&s;um'd it would not be ami&s;s if we toucht it o'er anew; and the rather for that a mo&s;t particular Relation being come from one of the Principal Officers that was pre&s;ent in that Action, it will not only rectify &s;everal Mi&s;takes that have been committed in mo&s;t of the other Ac|counts that have been Publi&s;h'd, but give a perfect Idea of that Glorious Battle.</HI></P>
<PB N="2" REF="2">
<P>THe Hard&s;hips &s;uffered by the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts,</HI> as well in going to the Enemies, when they were Encamped under <HI>E&s;&s;eck,</HI> as in re|turning thence, having as it were &s;pent all their Forces, the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> had no &s;ooner pa&s;s'd the <HI>Drave</HI> again, but that he pre|vail'd with the Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> to draw near the <HI>Danube,</HI> where Provi&s;ions could not be &s;o &s;carce as in the Parts whence they came. This was a Cour&s;e &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for the Army, that there was no other way to re&s;cue it from ab&s;olute Ruine; the Cavalry, more e&s;pecially, had been in want of Forrage for above a Month, for having been almo&s;t continually in the Moera&s;&s;es, it had had no o|ther &s;ub&s;i&s;tence than what they afforded.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> knowing it's Di&s;tre&s;s, and being al&s;o encourag'd by what had befall'n them near <HI>E&s;&s;eck,</HI> they march'd after it. In the mean while, the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> got to <HI>Mohatz,</HI> where they &s;taid eight whole days to recover them&s;elves of their Fatigues. There the <HI>Danube</HI> furni&s;h'd them with abundance of Provi&s;ions, and their Army being in &s;ome wi&s;e recover'd, a Council of War was held to con&s;ult on what undertaking it &s;hould be employed. Herein it was re&s;olv'd that <HI>Alba-Regalis</HI> &s;hould be Be&s;ieged, and that they &s;hould immediately begin their March to execute this De&s;ign. During the&s;e Tran&s;actions, &s;ome Parties of <HI>Tartars</HI> advanc'd un|der favour of the Woods, and &s;napt up our Forragers. The next day they did the &s;ame again, and our Spies brought back word that the whole <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Army was at hand, and was moving on|ward with Intention of Beleaguering <HI>Ziclos.</HI> A De&s;erter and a Pri&s;oner, taken by a Party, Confirm'd this Report; whereupon a new Council of War was held, the Re&s;ult of which was to demo|li&s;h <HI>Ziclos</HI> and <HI>Five-Churches,</HI> take the Garri&s;ons thence, and all that was within them, and then to march on to <HI>Alba-Regalis,</HI> where we were in hopes of making good Lines before the <HI>Turks</HI> could come up to us. On the 8th of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> we left <HI>Mohatz</HI> to put this De&s;ign in Execution, but we had no &s;ooner began our March, but that there appeared a Body of full three thou&s;and Hor&s;e, that advanced very near us, which compell'd us to halt. It Skirmi&s;h'd in good Order, in&s;omuch as to hinder the Army from getting that day to the place where the D. of <HI>Lorrain</HI> had de&s;ign'd to Encamp. Thus it &s;topp'd within half a League above <HI>Mohatz,</HI> where the Spies not only Confirm'd the News they had brought the day be|fore, but further that the <HI>Grand-Vizier</HI> had &s;o efficaciou&s;ly repre|&s;ented to the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> that he was in a Condition to fight the <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> that he had received Orders to give Battle. The
<PB N="3" REF="2"> Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> imparted the&s;e News to the Elector of <HI>Bavariae</HI> and the General Officers, who did not Que&s;tion the Truth of the Information, &s;eeing with what Boldne&s;s the three thou&s;and Hor&s;e had &s;topp'd them the day before. Neverthele&s;s they per&s;i&s;ted in the De&s;ign they had projected, and Orders were given for the continuing the March on the morrow. In the mean while, part of the Night was &s;pent in &s;ending out Parties, and in Clearing our Arms. The Parties gave not any Account on which any Reliance could be had, but a Spye that had been in the <HI>Turks</HI> very Camp, brought back word, that the <HI>Grand-Vizier</HI> had caus'd the Orders he had received from <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> to be proclaimed throughout the whole Camp, with a promi&s;e of rewarding all tho&s;e that &s;hould behave them&s;elves as became them in the Battle. The <HI>Imperial</HI> Army having renew'd it's March at break of day, it was again di&s;turb'd by a Body of Hor&s;e, that did not di&s;continue Skirting it, and ever and anon coming up to try it's temper. The Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> drew up Forces to receive them, but they made &s;o very Orderly a Retreat, that there was no way to get them to an Engagement. This pa&s;s'd on the 9th of the Month, and the Enemies Conduct was &s;till the &s;ame on the 10th and 11th, &s;till following the Army that was marching towards <HI>Ziclos.</HI> At la&s;t the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> being come that day near the Hill of <HI>Her&s;an,</HI> at the foot of which was formerly a fine Village bearing the &s;ame name, but which War has totally ruined, the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> had notice that the <HI>Grand-Vi|zier</HI> after having march'd Day and Night, had made &s;uch expe|dition that he was but a League di&s;tant from him, nay that he had po&s;&s;e&s;s'd him&s;elf of a Wood that was on his way, and wherein he had put &s;ome Troups, hoping to fall upon his in the Flank. As nothing was to be neglected with &s;uch an Enemy, that &s;ince the beginning of the Campagne had exerted &s;uch great Skill and Ex|perience as was not to have been expected in the <HI>Turks,</HI> it was thought expedient to call a Council of War anew: It was the E|lector of <HI>Bavaria</HI>'s turn to Command the Vanguard the next day; but as it was dangerous to make &s;uch a Movement, it was re&s;olv'd, contrary to what is commonly practic'd in a March, that every one &s;hould remain at the Po&s;t where he was the day before. We again &s;ent out &s;everal Parties, but of few men only, to know exactly whether what was &s;aid of the Enemy was true; but the Enemy on his &s;ide being not willing to lye &s;till, &s;ent two or three thou&s;and Hor&s;e that very Evening, which gave an Allarum to the Camp. As the whole Army &s;tood at their Arms, it was impo&s;&s;ible for them to
<PB N="4" REF="3"> do any thing, on the contrary they were drove back to the very Thickets, and we dur&s;t not pu&s;h them further, as fearing there might be &s;ome con&s;iderable Succours behind the Bu&s;hes. The Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> to be a&s;certain'd of this, caus'd Men to climb up to the Hill of <HI>Her&s;an,</HI> and they bringing him word that there appeared a great Body beyond the Thickets; &s;ome Voluntiers advanc'd to fire their Pi&s;tols at them; but not being &s;o advantageou&s;ly moun|ted as many of the <HI>Turks</HI> they went to attacque, they were imme|diately Surrounded, and their Heads hewn off in the pre&s;ence of the whole Army. This was done with &s;uch fearfull howlings, that it daunted all tho&s;e that had not yet been Engag'd with tho&s;e Barbarians. In the mean while, each Man withdrew into his Camp, and as it was not que&s;tion'd but that there would be a con&s;iderable Bru&s;h the next day, the Greater part of the Generals &s;pent the Night on Hor&s;eback, and towards break of day the Enemies came to Surprize and take away the main Guard. Some Blows were given in this Occa&s;ion, but the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> being in a due Po&s;ture, they kill'd 5 or 6 <HI>Turks</HI> for as many of theirs which &s;ell upon the Place. One of tho&s;e Barbarians who was not yet Dead, having been que&s;tion'd, &s;aid that the <HI>Grand-Vizier</HI> was there hard by with his Army, con&s;i&s;ting of Seaventy thou&s;and Men, that he had been Retrenching him&s;elf all the Night, that he had al&s;o lin'd the Wood, above mention'd, with more Men, that he pre|tended he was &s;o advantageou&s;ly Encamp'd, that he bragg'd he &s;hould defeat the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Army, without being compell'd to give Battle. Hereupon a Council of War was held a-new, and as the falling back would have been the abandoning of <HI>Zyclos</HI> and the other Places on the <HI>Drave,</HI> they agreed to pur&s;ue their march to|wards the former of tho&s;e Places. The Orders having accordingly been given, the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> put him&s;elf at the head of the Vanguard, which was compo&s;ed of the Right Wing, and that he might be under Cover from the Enemies that were in the Wood, he left &s;ome Dragoons and Battaillons to cover the flank of the Hor&s;e. The Enemies lying at watch to take their Advantages, made then a Movement which perplex'd the Duke of <HI>Lorrain;</HI> He perceiv'd that they were going to fall upon the Duke of <HI>Bava|ria;</HI> wherefore he Detach'd <HI>Picolomini</HI> with his Brigade to go give him Succours. And indeed they began to Skirmi&s;h with that Duke, who advancing to encourage his Men by his Pre&s;ence, a <HI>Turk</HI> &s;lipt along under &s;avour of the Bu&s;hes, and &s;eeing the Elector have a Red-Embroidered Coat on, with a white feather
<PB N="5" REF="3"> in his Hat, and thence pre&s;uming him to be a Per&s;on of Quality, he fancy'd it would be a Brave Exploit in him to kill him. Where|upon he fired his Fu&s;il at him, but in&s;tead of hitting him in the Body, he hit him in the left hand, and this made &s;o much noi&s;e that all tho&s;e that were not far from his Per&s;on believed him to be dangerou&s;ly wounded. Without farther Enquiry this &s;ame ru|mour was immediately &s;pread about his Troups, and this might have been of ill Con&s;equence, had he not &s;hewn him&s;elf immedi|ately to them all.</P>
<P>In the mean while, the Army being on its march, and the Van|guard having pa&s;s'd a Bottom, it mov'd up along a furrow, at the Upper End of which there was a Hedge that covered a Plain; Beyond this Hedge were &s;ome <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Hor&s;e, which were to amu&s;e the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> while the main Body fell upon the Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> made a &s;hew as if they meant to come to Blows with him; but having avoided the Battle at the &s;ame time they &s;eem'd to of|fer it: the whole &s;tre&s;s fell upon the Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> who having orders not to Engage, contented him&s;elf with &s;tanding upon the Defen&s;ive. This did &s;till the more Embolden the Infidels, and coming up very clo&s;e and every other moment to try his Tem|per, he &s;ent to acquaint the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> with the Po&s;ture of his Affairs, and to ask his leave to fight. The Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> &s;ent him back word to follow the Orders they had agreed on in the Morning, but his Electoral Highne&s;s &s;eeing him&s;elf &s;till more and more pre&s;s'd, &s;ent back to tell the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> that when they were in a Council of War, they might argue as they pleas'd, but that when the Enemies were pouring upon them the ca&s;e was very Different; that every other minute there fell-upon him new Battaillons and new Squadrons, which it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to &s;tand the Brunt of, by meerly keeping upon the Defen&s;ive, that his Men being thereby Expo&s;ed, began to murmur at &s;o much prudence; that it was to be feared that after their having &s;uffer'd much, they might take the Cour&s;e of avoid|ing the Danger by flight, &s;ince po&s;&s;ibly they would imagine they might honourably do &s;o, &s;ince we led 'em not on to fight.</P>
<P>During the&s;e Occurrences the Number of the Infidels did vi&s;i|bly multiply, and having &s;lipt along a Wood, they wholly fac'd it, in&s;omuch that when the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> came to pa&s;s, they made a Di&s;charge upon them, which laid &s;ome of them upon the &s;pot, and compell'd the Re&s;t to halt. To perplex them the more, they appeared at the &s;ame time at the Vanguard, but their De&s;ign being
<PB N="6" REF="4"> to make their utmo&s;t On&s;ets on the &s;ide of the Elector of <HI>Bavaria;</HI> They proceeded no further then to Skirmi&s;h, which hindred the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> from being able to &s;end other Snccours than that before-mentioned to the Reer. In the mean while, as every thing till then had promis'd them the Victory, a Body that had not as yet fall'n on, advanc'd the Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> with di&s;mal &s;creams and howlings, in&s;omuch that he &s;aw him&s;elf thereby forc'd, with|out &s;taying for the Permi&s;&s;ion he had to demand to fight, to u&s;e his utmo&s;t Endeavours to free him&s;elf from &s;o great a danger. He made head again&s;t them with &s;uch Troups as in whom he mo&s;t Confided, and having caus'd &s;mall Field-Pieces to be plac'd at the head of the Battaillons, they were put to &s;o good a u&s;e that they kept the Enemies in great Re&s;pect. In the mean while, <HI>Picolomini,</HI> who, as has been &s;aid, was &s;ent to the Duke of <HI>Bavaria's</HI> Succours, thinking him in great Danger, ran to him with his Men, and the Duke &s;eeing him come, Commanded him to drive the <HI>Turks</HI> from a Bottom, which he had newly pa&s;&s;ed him&s;elf. <HI>Picolomini</HI> execu|ted this Order with great Courage, and being &s;econded by good Fortune, he not only remained Ma&s;ter of the Bottom, but al&s;o pur&s;ued the Enemies to the very Wood, which they &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, and which was the place of their Retreat. There they perceived that they had unaccountably given way, &s;ince he had none to back him; In&s;omuch that being a&s;hamed of what they had done, they returned to the Charge, and made &s;uch havock of the Regiment of <HI>Commerci,</HI> which was of that Brigade, that in a trice they killed two hundred of it's men. The re&s;t &s;eeing this, betook them&s;elves to flight, and the &s;ooner for that they were all terrified to &s;ee the&s;e <HI>Barbarians,</HI> who had cut off the heads of the greater part, which they carried before them, howling at &s;uch a rate as was capable of daunting the mo&s;t Re&s;olute. In this Occa&s;ion was it that the Prince of <HI>Commerci</HI> was wounded with a Launce, and that the Count <HI>de Ligneville,</HI> the Major of his Regiment was killed, who&s;e Head they cut off as well as the re&s;t. The re&s;t of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Cavalry, ha|ving this advantage on it's &s;ide, fell then anew with extraordina|ry fury upon the Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> who was not a little put to it to &s;tand this fir&s;t On&s;et; Neverthele&s;s having of his own Per&s;on performed Wonders, and thereby given an Example to others, they all &s;tood firm; In&s;omuch that after a long and very ob&s;tinate fight the <HI>Turks</HI> began to Buckle; but in &s;uch good order, that in turning their backs they &s;eem'd le&s;s to Fly then make a Re|treat. This induced the Elector to con&s;ider whether he ought to
<PB N="7" REF="4"> pur&s;ue them or not; but that held him not long in &s;u&s;pence, they of them&s;elves return'd to the Charge, and that too with &s;o much Re&s;olution and Fury, that had not the Elector commanded Can|non to be brought, they had been Capable of routing him. But having caus'd it to be charg'd with Cartridges, he di&s;per&s;ed the mo&s;t daring. An infinite number of Volleys were fired in a trice, and this with &s;o much Succe&s;s, that we heard the Cries of tho&s;e that were wounded by them, which did &s;o very much intimidate the re&s;t, that they betook them&s;elves to flight. They retired a&s;ide the Wood, which put a &s;top for &s;ome time, apprehending it might be lin'd, and that in&s;tead of pro&s;ecuting a Victory, we might hazzard the receiving an Affront. In the mean while, the Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> having caus'd it to be view'd, and none of them being there found, we pur&s;ued them, but the Pur&s;uit was not long. After we had march'd a very little time we perceived they had entred into Retrenchments, which we could not believe tho' we &s;aw it with our Eyes. The&s;e Retrenchments had indeed been made in ha&s;t, and we &s;aw they had not had time to compleat them: But as their &s;cituation was advantageous (for they were between a Moera&s;s and a Wood) it was not judg'd convenient to advance further, without fir&s;t u&s;ing mature con&s;ideration. We perceived it to be the <HI>Grand-Viziers</HI> Camp, which was confirm'd to us by &s;ome Pri&s;oners, who inform'd us that there were &s;till &s;everal fre&s;h forces that had not as yet &s;tirr'd out of it. This occa&s;i|on'd new thoughts, as al&s;o for that the head of this Camp was defended by a Battery of twelve Pieces of Ordinance, which began to &s;peak to us in Thunder. It was &s;till further augmented in a Moment, and the <HI>Turks</HI> fearing that the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> would undertake to force them, notwith&s;tanding &s;o many difficulties, fell to work in our very &s;ight to &s;top up &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages that were as yet quite open. Nay, and we perceiv'd a Man with a Tur|bant all be&s;et with Jewels, and a &s;tately Ve&s;tment give his Orders without &s;eeming to be under the lea&s;t Concern. We judg'd as well by this Character as from the Richne&s;s of the things newly mention'd, that if it was not the <HI>Grand-Vizier,</HI> it was at lea&s;t a Per&s;on of very great Eminency among them. This aug|mented the Greedine&s;s of the Soldiery, who being vex'd that they had fought &s;o long without having got any thing, ask'd why they &s;topp'd at &s;uch &s;mall Impediments. The Elector was altogether of the &s;ame Opinion, but the General Officers about him having given him to under&s;tand that the undertaking to force tho&s;e Retrenchments without Cannon, would be too great
<PB N="8" REF="5" MS="y"> a venture, &s;everal Pieces were brought up, which were plac'd Battery-wi&s;e with wonderfull Expedition. The greater part of the Retrenchment being only of Dirt and Mud, having been hereby Levell'd in a trice, all of a Sudden we &s;aw the Cavalry march, without &s;taying for Orders, telling each other that if they could but pa&s;s, they were enrich'd for Ever. That of the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;eeing it coming with &s;o much Re&s;olution grew daunted, and without &s;taying for its coming up, fled cowardly away, a|bandoning the Infantry to the Di&s;cretion of the Conquerors. The <HI>Janizaries</HI> were &s;tartled at the De&s;ertion of their Hor&s;e, neverthele&s;s they march'd up to the Breach, which they defended with &s;uch Courage as was near a-kin to de&s;pair. But the Cavalry having open'd it &s;elf a pa&s;&s;age thro' other Places, they were quickly Surrounded and put to the Sword. The Re&s;t of the In|fantry &s;uffer'd very much, and none E&s;cap'd but the mo&s;t ready at their heels. All the Tents were found in the Camp, which the Elector having entred made directly up to that of the <HI>Grand-Vizier,</HI> which was ob&s;ervable for its Extraordinary wealth, and for &s;everal marks which are peculiar to the Generals of tho&s;e <HI>Barbarians.</HI> He found no body in it, nor about it, tho' it was well worth the pains of looking to, as well in regard of its &s;elf, as of what it contain'd.</P>
<P>In the mean while, the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> advanc'd, and Com|plemented his Electoral Highne&s;s upon the happy Succe&s;s of that Day; but having not lei&s;ure to enlarge much upon that, he gave <HI>Dunewaldt</HI> Order to pur&s;ue the Runaways, and detach'd Ten thou&s;and Hor&s;e for that Expedition. This Gen. found &s;ome of the Fugitives on the way, but making directly to the Bridge which the <HI>Turks</HI> had o're the <HI>Drave,</HI> he found the main Body had pa&s;s'd it, and had broke the Bridge after them. But the &s;hore was all &s;trew'd with Cloaths, and Bodies lay all floating o're the River. Two <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's,</HI> and &s;everal of the Principal Officers were taken Pri&s;oners, with about Eight hundred Common Soldiers, and the Dead ten times as many. The Conquerors got all the Cannon, con&s;i&s;ting in Ninety pieces of Ordinance, and twelve Mortar-pieces, with Tents, Camels, Waggons, and Elephants in Abundance, with all other &s;orts of Booty allmo&s;t beyond Imagi|nation. This Victory co&s;t the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> not above &s;ix Hundred Men, as they them&s;elves &s;ay, and as others Eighteen hundred. And thus ended that Glorious Day, for which <HI>Te Deum</HI> was &s;ung in the Camp, at <HI>Vienna, Rome,</HI> and <HI>Venice.</HI></P>
