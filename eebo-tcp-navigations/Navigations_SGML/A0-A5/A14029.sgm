<P><HI>_RYght</HI> hono|rable and renou|med Barons, it is nobly written by <HI>I&s;ocrates,</HI> that chil+dren oughte too keepe their fathers Friends as dilige~t|ly: as they woulde their owne inheri|tance. And your father of worthy me|morie, loued my father deerely, &amp; hee liued togither with your Grandfather many yeeres in the Courte of Duke George the noble Duke of <HI>Saxonie,</HI> and he was borne in the dayes of your Greatgrandfather of <HI>Austine Turler</HI> his father, who was then Con&s;ull of
<PB REF="3"> <HI>Le&s;nick,</HI> which towne is vnder your in|ri&s;diction at this day, and whereof my Vncle is nowe at this pre&s;ent Con|&s;ull, one whom yee knowe ryghtwell. Wherefore, I haue often deui&s;ed with my &s;elf, by what meanes I might like|wi&s;e continue this frendship, or rather te&s;tefie my dutie towards you &amp; your familie, and if it could bee, how to en|large the &s;ame, but hetherto I coulde finde no good opportunitie, for that yee were of &s;o &s;mal yeeres that wanted rather in&s;truction in di&s;cretion, and good manners: then to bee occupied in debating of graue matters, and al&s;o yee had &s;uch in&s;tructers, and &s;choole|mai&s;ters, that if yee followed their do|cumentes there should redownd great honour to your &s;elues, and great com|moditie to your &s;ubiectes. Albeit then it be &s;o, that ye haue no neede of myne admonicio~, either to the &s;tudie of ver|tue &amp; godline&s;&s;e, or towards the attai|ning of good artes &amp; learning: yet the &s;ignificatio~ of a mans dutie is wont to be acceptable to good natures, &amp; &s;uch
<PB REF="3"> e&s;pecially &s;uch as are of Nobilitie, and de&s;cended of the greate&s;t parentage. Thus &s;taying my &s;elf vpo~ this grou~d: I &s;e~d vnto ye this booke which I haue written in the behalf of &s;uch as are de|&s;ierous to traueill, and to &s;ee forreine Cuntries, &amp; &s;pecially of &s;tudents. For &s;ince Experience is the greate&s;t parte of humane wi&s;edome, and the &s;ame is increa&s;ed by traueil: I &s;uppo&s;e there is no man will deney, but that a ma~ may become the wi&s;er by traueiling. How beit if in any thing: &s;urely in this mo&s;t diligent circum&s;pection is very requi|&s;ite, by rea&s;on of the daungers that of|fer them&s;elues vnto traueilers, and the weakene&s;&s;e of mans iudgment, which vnle&s;&s;e it be then confirmed by v&s;e &amp; experience, and holpen by the coun&s;el of others: it will &s;oone be brought into errour. Here is moreouer to be added, that the youth and flourishing yeeres are mo&s;te commonly employd in tra|ueill, which of their owne cour&s;e and condicion are inclined vnto vice, and much more erne&s;tly imbrace the &s;ame
<PB REF="4"> if it be enti&s;ed thereto, which manica time and often chaunceth in trauey|ling: wherfore, mee thinkes they do a good deede, and well de&s;erue of al me~: that gyue preceptes of traueyling. Which thing, althoughe I perceyue that &s;ome haue doone: yet haue they doone it heere and there in &s;undrie Bookes, and not in any one certeine place. And being a nece&s;&s;arie thing to haue all &s;uch matter in a readine&s;&s;e as may well and profitably be &s;aid of one thing: I haue therefore handled that argument according to the definitiue Methode, as they &s;peake in the &s;chooles, and haue comprehended al|&s;o, as I iudge, in one Booke, what&s;oe|uer is nece&s;&s;arie for any to know con|cerning the due taking in hand of tra|ueill, and the pro&s;perous perfourming of the &s;ame. I haue al&s;o adioyned vn|to this di&s;cour&s;e another booke, wher|in I haue applied tho&s;e preceptes of mine, vnto &s;uch things as &s;eemed vnto me worthy the &s;eing and ob&s;eruing in the Realme of <HI>Naples,</HI> which beeinge
<PB REF="4"> none other thing then an example of &s;uch documentes as wee haue &s;et down in the fir&s;t Booke: I haue therefore made the title vnto all the whole wri|ting, <HI>Of Traueill, and of the Realme of Naples,</HI> becau&s;e no man shall thinke that I haue coupled contrary thinges togither. For although in deede it bee one thing to intreate of the Realme of <HI>Naples,</HI> and another thing to giue pre|ceptes vnto &s;uch as meane to traueill: yet &s;ince traueiling con&s;i&s;teth of view|ing &amp; diligent con&s;ideratio~ of things, and preceptes are lightned by exam|ples: there is no iu&s;t impediment to the contrarie, but that I maye ioyne the&s;e twaine togither. And as I haue al&s;o admonished in the booke: I tru&s;t that this my labour will bee the more acceptable vnto &s;ome, for the &s;ame cau&s;e. For if they shall want preceptes they shall finde them heere in a readi|ne&s;&s;e, and if they do require an exam|ple agreeable to preceptes, they haue heere &s;uche a one beefore their eyes which may both in&s;truct their mindes
<PB REF="5"> and al&s;o inflame them vnto the know+ledge of mo&s;t bewtifull &s;ightes, and Antiquitie. Receiue in good parte, Right honorable and renoumed Ba|rons, this &s;imple gifte from mee, and therin my dutie and &s;eruice towardes ye and your familie. Which if it shall plea&s;e you to do: I wil do min indeuor to omit nothing which I may thinke to tende vnto the commendation and ornament of your hou&s;e: and that my good will may be knowen vn|to you hereafter, by &s;ome tra|ueill of more graue ar|gument.</P>

<P><HI>_THis worde Pe|regrinus</HI> which &s;ignifi|eth a &s;traunger or tra|ueiler, in the Latine tongue in &s;undrye ages hath had &s;undry &s;ignifications.

<PB N="2" REF="10"> calling all &s;uch only by the name of Straungers as were not fr&eacute;e of the Citie of <HI>Rome,</HI> as beeing perhaps La|tines borne, or altogither Aliens: and in this &s;ignification it is v&s;ed at this pre|&s;ent. So that this worde <HI>Peregrinari</HI> to traueile, de&s;cendeth from the worde <HI>Pe|ragrare</HI> to wander, which &s;ignifieth to traueyle in &s;traunge and forreine Cun|treyes, to wander in places a&s;well vn|knowne as knowne out of a mans own Cuntrey, or Citie.

But I lyke of <HI>Platoes</HI> opinion well enough.

<PB N="11" REF="14"> bicau&s;e that a de&s;olate Citie, and &s;uch an one as knoweth not what is good or bad in forein countreys, is verie far from perfection. And whereas hee hath apointed that terme of y&eacute;eres to be emploid in traueill: the rea&s;on is this, for that h&eacute;e would haue that time e&s;pe|ciallye to b&eacute;e b&eacute;e&s;towed in learninge of maners and &s;earchinge other know|ledge. For &s;ince at tho&s;e y&eacute;eres mans iudgement is mo&s;te perfect: h&eacute;e is the better able to di&s;cerne and iudge of mat|ters, then in his youth, or old age, wher|of the one is rather enclined to vice then vertue and is ruled by affection, the other beginneth to fail in memory, and cannot well v&s;e the iudgement of the &s;ences. And although h&eacute;e forbidde not young men to traueill, wherby they al|&s;o may &s;umdeale profite in maners and knowledge: notwith&s;tandinge fora&s;|much as that age is but of weake iudg|ment, hee co~mitteth that care to men of ryper y&eacute;eres, not &s;o much for priuat, as for common co~modytie.

The other kind of gaine is di&s;hone&s;t, which repug|neth w^t nature and vertue, &s;uch as they do practize which giue them&s;elus wholy to robbing and &s;poyling, who being vn|mindfull of the law of armes, and of the Oth which &s;ouldiours take: do not &s;pare nor ab&s;taine from their friendes goods. That kind of gain al&s;o which is co~mon|ly hatefull among men, as v&s;urers, and others that heap vp wealth by right or wrong with &s;uch gredines and auarice, that as the Poet &s;aith, they run to the furthe&s;t Indians, and all to e&s;chew po|uertie, leauing nothing vna&s;&s;aied wher|of they may rai&s;e to them&s;elues &s;ome gain.

<P>But principally wee mu&s;t weigh and

Howbeit h&eacute;e mu&s;t n&eacute;edes doe them both if h&eacute;e will do well.

For there be certen cuntries, Realmes, and Cities at this pre&s;ent, whiche are gouerned by the Kinge and the Nobillitie together, as <HI>Denmarke:</HI> and as it was likewi&s;e at <HI>Rome</HI> in the time of the Kings vnto the <HI>Tarquines:</HI> &s;ome by the King and commonaltie, as <HI>Per&s;ia:</HI> &s;ome by the Nobilitie and com|monalty, as <HI>Florence, Siene,</HI> and diuers other Cities of <HI>Italie,</HI> the lyke whereof was practized at <HI>Rome</HI> after the expul|&s;ion of the Kinges, at <HI>Lacedaemon,</HI> and <HI>Athens:</HI> finally, &s;ome are gouerned by the Kinge, Nobylitie, and co~monaltye,

<P>Let vs moreouer con&s;ider al the Mo|narchies of the world, and w&eacute;e &s;hal per|ceaue that the Princes that ruled in them, atchieued mo&s;t excellent exployts by traueilling, as <HI>Ninus</HI> &amp; <HI>Nabucadne|zer</HI> in the fir&s;t Monarchie: <HI>Cyrus, Da|rius</HI> and <HI>xerxes</HI> in the &s;econd: and <HI>A|lexander</HI> the great in the thirde, with whom al&s;o that Monarchie began and ended.

<HEAD><HI>The.</HI> 8. <HI>Chapter.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BUt there are &s;ome y^t much emba&s;e traueilling, deterring men fro~ it ma|ny waies. The&s;e holde opinion that the name of Traueillyng is not only infa|mous, but al&s;o the thing it &s;elfe: which they proue out of certen places of <HI>Tully,</HI> and of <HI>Vlpian</HI> the Lawyer. For in the <HI>Thu&s;culane Que&s;tions, Tullie</HI> compareth bani&s;hment with Traueill, and in an Epi&s;tle to <HI>Caelius,</HI> h&eacute;e emba|&s;eth Traueill, terminge it reprochfull, and filthy. And <HI>Vlpain</HI> calleth it <HI>Depor+tation,</HI> a tearme of the law, being a pu|ni&s;hme~t, wherin a man both loo&s;eth his goodes, is di&s;frauched his citie, and is a|pointed certen limits within which h&eacute;e &s;hall dwell and abide. After this maner
<PB N="89" REF="53"> the Poet <HI>Ouid,</HI> was exiled vnto the ci|tie of <HI>Tomos</HI> in <HI>Pontus,</HI> l&eacute;e&s;ing the be|nefit of the citie, and all his goods being excheated. Quer this, they obiect that Traueillers are in hatred amonge good men, reguarded none otherwi&s;e but as Rogues and Vacaboundes that can ta|rie in no place, although ind&eacute;ede they haue verie iu&s;t cau&s;e to goe abroad. And therfore they call them wandring Pla|nets and Vacaboundes, as if they were forced thereto for &s;ome puni&s;hment, or were in &s;uch wi&s;e by God puni&s;hed. And y^t by y^e example of <HI>Cain</HI> who~ God cur&s;ed, &s;aying that he &s;hould be a Vaca|bounde vpon the earth: b&eacute;einge al&s;o an accu&s;tomable maner of cur&s;ing among the ancient people in foretime, as <HI>Odei|pus</HI> did among the Tragidies writers. Whervpon hath growne the Prouerbe <HI>Oedipus cur&s;e,</HI> &amp; <HI>Laertius</HI> writeth that <HI>Diogenis</HI> the Ethnick was wont to &s;ay that he had met w^t &s;ome tragicall cur&s;e. For hee (&s;aide he) was without hou&s;e, without Citie, depriued of his cuntrey, hauinge no certentie of his lyfe.</P>
<PB N="90" REF="54">
<P> Thirdly, they crie out again&s;t trauei|lers as iniurious to their Parentes, friendes, wyues, and children, whyl&s;t they &s;eperate the~&s;elues after a maner, voluntarely from them. Like as <HI>Pro|pertius</HI> inueieth again&s;t one <HI>Po&s;thu|mus,</HI> that through an vn&s;atiable de&s;ire of warfare: &s;uffred him&s;elfe to be caried away from the mo&s;t plea&s;aunt compa|nie of his wife, who&s;e cur&s;e is this.</P>
<L>If I may wishe: would God yee gree|die wretches all were dead,</L>
<L>Or who &s;o el&s;e loues warres aboue his faithfull &s;pou&s;es bed.</L>
<P>And no le&s;&s;e they wi&s;h vnto him com|mo~ly, who hath more delight to wa~der abrood, and neuer bide in one place, the~ tariyng in their owne natiue cuntrey, enioy the mo&s;t acceptable companie &amp; conuer&s;atio~ of their friends &amp; kin&s;folks, whervpo~ it was written by the Poet.</P>
<L>Him I accu&s;e, and much accompt vnwi&s;e,</L>
<L>Abandoning his natiue Cuntrey &s;oile:</L>
<L>Who &s;o the &s;ame &s;o lightly doth di&s;pi&s;e,</L>
<L>And loues abrod in foreine land to toile.</L>
<P>Fourthly, they complaine that Tra|ueilers mu&s;t indure infinite labours
<PB N="91" REF="54"> and troubles, &amp; not only &s;tand in daun|ger of their goods: but often of their life al&s;o. Which thing &s;urely ca~not be deni|ed, as it is prooued by the examples of <HI>Vli&s;ses,</HI> and <HI>Aeneas.</HI></P>
<P>Fifthly, this &s;aying is v&s;ually obiec|ted again&s;t them, that is to &s;ay: <HI>They which run ouer&s;ea, chaunge the aire &amp; not their minde,</HI> and reprochfully they allege tho&s;e ver&s;es which are written again&s;t &s;uch, who, traueiling abroad to &s;tudie: returne home againe neuer a whit better learned then when they went foorth.</P>
<L>Who&s;o to Paris to his booke doth &s;end a foolish A&s;se:</L>
<L>Shall there be made no hor&s;e, but bide as er&s;t before he was.</L>
<P>By the&s;e &amp; &s;uch like prouerbes, &amp; &s;ay|ings, they &s;&eacute;eme to auouch thr&eacute;e things. Fir&s;t y^t the exchaunge of place doth not change the per&s;ons nature. Secondly, y^t vertues &amp; vices, are borne w^t vs, and not fir&s;t grow in vs. Thirdly, that ver|tues cannot b&eacute;e learned, nor vices for|gotte~.

<P> Sixtly, the cite <HI>Lycurgus</HI> lawe out of <HI>Plato,</HI> wherein h&eacute;e forbad his Citizens the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> to traueill, alledg|inge for a cau&s;e, that then they &s;hall not bring &s;traunge orders and fa&s;hions into the Commonwealth, which is a rea&s;on verie plau&s;ible, and alledged al&s;o by <HI>Plato.</HI></P>
<P>Seuenthly, they bring foorth <HI>Claudia|nus</HI> ver&s;es again&s;t them.</P>
<L>O happie hee that &s;pent his daies in natiue Soyles delight,</L>
<L>Whom one &s;elf hou&s;e hath &s;eene a child, and eke an aged wight.</L>
<L>Who limping with his &s;taffe wher once he playd the litle Mou&s;e:</L>
<L>Can count the manie yeeres which hee hath pa&s;t in one poore hou&s;e.</L>
<P>And al&s;o the ver&s;es of <HI>Horace</HI> writen in the ij <HI>Ode,</HI> with <HI>Ouid</HI> likewi&s;e wher he &s;ayth.</P>
<L>Who lea&s;t hath liu'd in light: beleeue mee be&s;t his dayes hath &s;pent,</L>
<L>And eche man ought to liue within his boundes, and be content.</L>
<P>Al which te&s;timonies i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">inctly confirm,
<PB N="93" REF="55"> that the happie lyfe con&s;i&s;teth in Idle|ne&s;&s;e. But Traueilers may not liue idly if they be carefull of their affaires, and meane to looke well to their bu&s;i|ne&s;&s;e: wherby they cannot b&eacute;e thought to leade the happy lyfe, &s;ince they mete with &s;o many mi&s;cheifes, and dangers, with &s;undrye ca&s;ualities of Fortune that b&eacute;efall in traueillinge. Let vs ther|fore examine the&s;e argumentes, and an&s;wer to the&s;e obiections, being mind|full of y^e &s;ame definition which we haue &s;et downe at the b&eacute;eginning, and of &s;uch matter as we haue declared in the for|mer chapter touching y^e declaracio~ of it.</P>
<P>And as touchinge the fir&s;t two argu|ments. For that which they call <HI>De|portation</HI> or exile is one thing, and tra|ueill an other, and that by con&s;ent of all Gramarianes. And although the antique Writers haue frequented one of the&s;e wordes for an other: notwith|&s;tanding ech of them haue begon now to haue their proper and di&s;tinct &s;ig|nification which the cu&s;tume of &s;uch as &s;peake properly hath obtayned. And
<PB N="94" REF="56"> therefore, although <HI>Cicero</HI> do compare exile w^c traueill: yet is exile one thing, and traueill another. Againe, it is one thing perpetually to traueill, of which kind of trauel <HI>Cicero</HI> &s;peketh in y^e place alledged: another thing to traueill for a time, wherof we intreate in this place: and therfore it is no merueill if <HI>Cicero</HI> terme the fir&s;t, filthie, and much emba|&s;eth it. For he that traueyleth perpetu|ally, and neuer returneth into his cun|trey from which h&eacute;e hath been long ab|&s;ent, or &s;&eacute;eketh not &s;ome other place where to abide there to enioy the com|modities which he hath gathered by his long traueill: nothing differeth from a bani&s;hed ma~. And in y^t he &s;heweth him|&s;elf iniurious to his Cuntrey and kin&s;|folkes, who~ he might helpe w^t his coun|&s;ell and adui&s;e, or otherwi&s;e: he is wor|thely accoumpted an infamous per&s;on. So <HI>Vlpian</HI> likewi&s;e &s;peaketh of perpe|tuall traueil, which is re&s;e~bled to death. For h&eacute;e that is puni&s;hed with <HI>Depor|tation,</HI> loo&s;eth the benefite of the Citie, and his fr&eacute;edome, as is accoumpted a
<PB N="95" REF="56"> dead per&s;on. And truly the word Tra|ueiler or Straunger, &s;ignified by the Latine <HI>Peregrinus</HI> in many places in the law is taken in the better part, and v&s;ed in the proper &s;ignification, as I haue b&eacute;efore declared where I &s;pake of traueillers Priuiledges, highly com|mending y^t traueiling of <HI>Cicero, Plato,</HI> and <HI>Pythagoras.</HI></P>
<P>And by this di&s;tinction al&s;o w&eacute;e may &s;hape an an&s;wer to y^e third argument. For like as we &s;peake not of perpetual traueiling: &s;o doe we not excu&s;e them that traueill for intent to b&eacute;e fr&eacute;e from &s;uch burdens &amp; charges, as they &s;houlde beare at home: or y^t they might loo&s;e the reines vnto al licentiou&s;nes which they might not be &s;uffred to doe at home: or el&s;e by right or wrong by fal&s;e mercha~|dize, or other &s;ini&s;ter meanes: purloyne mony fro~ the &s;trange nations, b&eacute;eyng ignorant of their deceitful dealing. And like as the lawes haue prouided y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> there &s;hall none &s;uch b&eacute;e &s;uffred in any place, yea, if there b&eacute;e any that &s;elleth vnlaw|full Wares for lawfull is not put
<PB N="69" REF="57"> to his fine nor amer&s;ed, but ether is ba|ni&s;hed or put to death: &s;o they that doo altogether mi&s;lyke of traueill agr&eacute;e with vs in this poynct: that w&eacute;e wi&s;h &s;uch di&s;&s;emblers and vacabundes &s;huld not only not be &s;uffred in eny place, but al&s;o vtterly b&eacute;e rooted out, and expelled from euery place.</P>
<P>Vnto the third argument it may b&eacute;e an&s;wered out of the &s;econd, and third chapters. For there w&eacute;e haue put a di&s;|tinction b&eacute;etw&eacute;ene tho&s;e that are m&eacute;ete to traueill, &amp; tho&s;e y^t ar not m&eacute;ete. Like|wi&s;e b&eacute;etw&eacute;ene them that traueill with frute and &s;uch as take that labour vpon them for plea&s;ure only, if &s;o it b&eacute;e, that labour may bee called a plea&s;ure. But perhaps &s;ome man wil demaund, whe|ther &s;uch as be maried b&eacute;e m&eacute;ete to tra|ueill? For ouer that, that w&eacute;emen are forbidden, as it were of hone&s;tie and womanhoode, not to take long or often iourneis in hand: it is the lawe of ma|trimonie that tho&s;e whiche bee coupled therin &s;hall dwell euermore together, and the one to b&eacute;e a comforte vnto the
<PB N="97" REF="57"> other. Howb&eacute;eit this matter, as ap|perteyning to y^e w&eacute;eme~, dependeth vpo~ the cu&s;tome of the Cuntrey, as I haue touched before, in re&s;pect whereof Ma|trimonie is not hindred. Yea, what if a man take &s;uch a viage in hand whiche would be profitable to the~ both, y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> wife and all the hou&s;hold affaires, &s;uch as are the iourneis of Merchants, &amp; other that traueil for vertue &s;ake? Moreouer, ther may be mutuall frind&s;hip and affection &s;hewed eue~ in traueiling, &amp; one minde, and one &s;oule remaine in two bodies, although the two bodies be di&s;tant far a &s;under. And the Ciuile lawes al&s;o per|mitte men to traueill after they haue contracted mariage, if they haue a law|full cau&s;e: wherefore it &s;uffreth them lykewi&s;e that are maryed, &s;ince agr&eacute;e|ing together, not lying together, ma|keth the Maryage. And &s;o farre of are traueylers from hurting their parents, and friendes: that if they had &s;tayde at home oftentimes they helpe them but little, but hauing traueyled, doe aduan|tage them very much.</P>
<PB N="98" REF="58">
<P> Fourthly, that which they alledge cannot b&eacute;e denied, as I haue &s;hewed. But there hence it followeth not that traueill is to be neglected, &s;ince there be other meanes al&s;o wherby a man may come to ca&s;ualtie and lo&s;&s;e of goods, or b&eacute;e in daunger of his lyfe. And payne which is annexed vnto traueill, is lyke|wi&s;e common vnto all other affayres that are of any accoumpt, and whereof w&eacute;e &s;&eacute;eke prai&s;e and renoume, that I may &s;peake nothing of the commoditie that en&s;ueth theron.</P>

<P>The fifth argument is plau&s;ible, bea|ring experience w^t it for witne&s;&s;e.

Wherefore, it is no merueill at all, if &s;uch men continue al|waies like them&s;elues, nothing amen|ding their manners: for they neuer &s;et|led the~&s;elues therto. But if they would diligently ob&s;erue tho&s;e thinges which we haue noted before in y^e third Chap|ter they &s;huld become the better, &amp; haue a more erne&s;t care to furni&s;h, and decke their minde. This di&s;commoditie al&s;o en&s;ueth, y^t returning fro~ &s;trang lands: they ioyne the~&s;elues to the &s;ame or like companions as they were delighted w^t all before, or el&s;e forgetting al dau~gers, giue the~&s;elues ouer vnto all leudne&s;&s;e, and &s;en&s;ualitie.

<P>As &s;aith y^e Satyrical Poet. Otherwi&s;e their &s;aying is fal&s;e, y^e affirme how the cha~ging of y^e place, changeth not a ma~s nature. Since experience vppon which they rea&s;on, teacheth the contrarie, and

For if fields by dilige~t hu&s;ban|ding maye bee amended: what impedi|me~t is there, but a rude per&s;on &amp; prone to vice may bee made better by dayly co~uer&s;ation w^t good men?

Wher|fore, we mu&s;t diligently take h&eacute;ede that we imitate the vertues and not y^e vices of other, of which point I haue admoni|&s;hed before.

<P><HI>Fredirick</HI> the &s;econde Emperoure of <HI>Rome,</HI> founded the Vniuer&s;itie in this Citie, whiche flouri&s;heth at this daye.

The &s;ame, b&eacute;e&s;ides the Booke whiche h&eacute;e wroat of the bur|ninge of the cuntrie of, <HI>Puteolis,</HI> wher|of I made mencion b&eacute;efore, wroat a Booke of the Soule, of the Sen&s;es, of Coulers, of the <HI>Germain</HI> Mayden, and many other moe. One <HI>Mercellus</HI> of <HI>Siene</HI> was of great renowme amonge the <HI>Icti,</HI> a man very well learned and eloquent: as for Diuinitie that was in tho&s;e daies &s;ent to the Mona&s;teries and Abbeies, as it was likewi&s;e in the more part of all <HI>Italie. Naples</HI> f&eacute;eleth winter &s;car&s;elye the &s;pace of two Monthes, to wit, <HI>Ianuarie</HI> &amp; <HI>Februarie.</HI> They haue raine often, but without &s;nowe, and in Summer &s;ea&s;on extreame heat, by rea|&s;on whereof they &s;eldome haue anye

There are ma|ny Th&eacute;eues, and in &s;undrye places the Neapolitanes are euill &s;poken of, not &s;o mutch for that them&s;elues be of an euill Nature: but bicau&s;e they harbour ma|ne naughty per&s;ons, and haue naughtie neighbours.

<P>WIthout the Citie, on y^e &s;ide which is contrarie or oueragain&s;t y^t hill <HI>Pau&s;ilipus:</HI> are &s;&eacute;ene the kinges Pittes or Pondes commonly called <HI>Pozzi reali,</HI> truely verie fayre, and worthie to b&eacute;e throughly viewed. And vnle&s;&s;e I b&eacute;e deceaued, there is the lyke place at <HI>Rome,</HI> and at <HI>Ferraria Ilbel Veder,</HI> which is to &s;aye, as I interprete it, A

From hence againe w&eacute;e goe into other gardeines: at length w&eacute;e come vnto a fountaine or conduite head pa&s;&s;ing faire and cleare, and full of hol&s;ome &s;w&eacute;ete water. Hard by this conduite head &s;toode certen Cagies and Couppes, wherein were kepte &s;undry kindes of bea&s;ts, and liuing things, but they were al&s;o broken by the French|men.

<P>From this place w&eacute;e maye goo too &s;&eacute;e the remainder and monumentes of the citie <HI>Palaeopolis,</HI> whereof <HI>Liuius</HI> ma|keth mencion. There is al&s;o another
