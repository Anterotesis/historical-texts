<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS the late <HI>Revolution</HI> that has given birth to this new Piece of Work; a New Face of Things required a <HI>New State of Eng|land.</HI> And of all the Changes this King|dom has gone through, as this was the mo&s;t &s;udden, &s;o it is the mo&s;t wonderfull. To &s;ee Popery in &s;o few days crowing upon the Throne and groaning under its Ruins, but t'other day upon the Pinnacle and now &s;tun|ned with its &s;udden Fall, is &s;uch a Change as may de&s;erve the Admiration of this and future Ages. In &s;hort, &s;uch is our pre&s;ent Settlement, upon Their Maje&s;ties happy Ac|ce&s;&s;ion to the Crown, that the Popi&s;h Party may a&s;&s;oon &s;ee a Prote&s;tant Pope of Rome as a Popi&s;h King of England.</P>
<PB REF="4">
<P>Now, to make this Work the more accep|table and u&s;efull to the Publick, I have di|vided it into three &s;everal Parts. In the <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> you have a particular De&s;cription of <HI>EN|GLAND</HI> in its &s;everal Counties; of e|very County-Town, with the Di&s;tance, and the common Road to it, from <HI>London</HI> the Metropolis; and of all other Places of note in each County. Here you have particularly a Li&s;t of the Market-Towns in every Shire, with the Days pointed when their Markets are kept; al&s;o, an account of mo&s;t other Remarkable Things, either of Nature or Art. Be&s;ides the Honours, or Noblemens Titles, from Counties, Cities, Towns, Man|nors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And the Number of Men each City, or Borough, &s;ends to &s;erve in Parlia|ment. I conclude this Part with a particular De&s;cription of <HI>London, Oxford,</HI> and <HI>Cam|idge. London</HI> as the Capital City of England, the Seat of its Monarchs, and the Center of Trade. <HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Cambridge,</HI> as being the two famous &V;niver&s;ities of the Land, and the glorious Seats of the Mu&s;es.</P>
<P>The <HI>Second Part</HI> treats of the <HI>INHA|BITANTS</HI> of England; their Com|plexion,
<PB REF="4">Temper, Genius, Language, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Of the Engli&s;h Way of Living, Commerce, Laws, Religion, and Government. Of the King of England, and the Royal Family; particularly of the pre&s;ent King <HI>WILLIAM</HI> and Queen <HI>MARY,</HI> with a brief Relation of their Acce&s;&s;ion to the Crown, and the &V;n|rea&s;onablene&s;s of the Di&s;affected Party under their Government. Of Their Maje&s;ties Court, Forces, and Revenues. Of the Queen Dowager, the Prince, and the Prin|ce&s;s of Denmark. Of the Nobility, Gen|try, and Commonalty. Of the Epi&s;copal, Dignify'd, and Inferiour Clergy. And la&s;t|ly of Women, Children, and Servants. All of them with their re&s;pective Privi|ledges.</P>
<P>The <HI>Third</HI> and <HI>la&s;t Part</HI> is about the <HI>COURTS</HI> of <HI>JUDICATURE.</HI> Viz. The High Court of Parliament, with a large Account of their Proceedings, Orders, Debates, Pa&s;&s;ing of Bills and Acts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Of the Privy-Council, and there particular|ly of the Principal Secretaries of State. Of the Chancery, Kings-Bench, Common Pleas, Exchequer, Dutchy of Lanca&s;ter, and all
<PB REF="5">other Courts. To which is annexed a Cata|logue of the chief Per&s;ons of the Realm both in Church and State, Magi&s;trates, and Of|ficers Civil and Military. Who being &s;ubject to Change, though the Offices continue the &s;ame, I thought it improper to mix Cer|tainties and &V;ncertainties together. There|fore I cho&s;e rather to place the Officers toge|ther by them&s;elves, as I have done here, than to have them di&s;per&s;ed where I &s;peak of their Offices. And from this Method you will reap this Conveniency, that, by Interleaving of the Catalogue only, you may fill up Vacan|cies as they become void.</P>
<P>Thus you have (as it were) a <HI>Scheme</HI> of the whole Drift of this Book. The Foundati|on whereof is that Ingenious Piece <HI>De Repub|lica Anglorum,</HI> written in Latin by <HI>Sir Tho|mas Smith,</HI> Improved as you &s;ee, and fitted to the pre&s;ent Times. The Matter of it &s;elf, is of a general &V;&s;e both for Engli&s;h and Foreiners; and the Variety &s;o great, that it cannot but be Plea&s;ant and &V;&s;efull to the Reader.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">England</HEAD>
<P><HI>ENGLAND</HI> is the be&s;t and large&s;t Part of the greate&s;t I&s;land of <HI>Eu|rope.</HI> An I&s;land anciently called <HI>Albion,</HI> from its white chalky Cliffs; but &s;ince better known by the Name of <HI>Great Britain. Great,</HI> for the va&s;t Extent of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, reaching (as it does) in Length, from North to South, about 600 Miles. <HI>Britain,</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="21">that is, a Country Inhabited by Painted Men, as formerly they were wont to be.</P>
<P>At this time 'tis principally divided into three Parts, <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Wales;</HI> the fir&s;t two being two di&s;tinct Kingdoms, the la&s;t a Principality, but all of them happily united under one Head.</P>
<P><HI>ENGLAND</HI> takes up the South Parts of the I&s;land, being parted from <HI>Scotland</HI> North|ward by the River <HI>Tweede;</HI> from <HI>Wales</HI> We&s;t|ward, in part by the River <HI>Dee;</HI> and from the re&s;t of the World, by the <HI>Ocean.</HI> Thus it con|tains in Length, from North to South, as from <HI>Barwick</HI> to <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> 320 miles; and in breadth, from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, as from <HI>Dover</HI> to the Lands End, 270.</P>
<P>But &s;uch is the Variety of its Breadth, that in the South Parts, which face the Channel, 'tis three times the Breadth of the North. And all along the Sea-Coa&s;t in general there are &s;o many Creeks and Inlets, &s;ome greater and &s;ome le&s;&s;er, that <HI>England</HI> (and indeed the whole I&s;land) delineated as it is in Globes and Maps, makes but an odd kind of Figure. However in this Spot of Ground, not exceeding one third Part of <HI>France,</HI> there are reckoned 30 millions of Acres.</P>
<P>In reference to the Globe, it lies between the 50, and 57 Degree of North Latitude; the longe&s;t Day in the mo&s;t Northern Parts being 17 hours, 30 minutes; and the &s;horte&s;t in the mo&s;t Southern, almo&s;t eight hours long.</P>
<P>The name of <HI>ENGLAND</HI> it took from the <HI>Angles,</HI> an ancient People of <HI>Jutland</HI> in <HI>Denmark;</HI> who, joyning with their Neighbours the <HI>Saxons,</HI> went under their Name in the Conque&s;t of <HI>Britain.</HI> And this Name was
<PB N="3" REF="21">given it by a &s;pecial Edict of <HI>Egbert,</HI> the fir&s;t &s;ole Monarch of <HI>England,</HI> &s;ince the Hep|tarchy. Who, being de&s;cended from tho&s;e <HI>Angles,</HI> and having reduced the whole Coun|try from a divided State into one intire Body, called it (with the Concurrence of the States of the Realm, then convened at <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> Anno 819.) by the Name of <HI>Engle-lond,</HI> &s;ince turned into <HI>ENGLAND.</HI> From whence the Nation and Language came to be called <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>

Whereas <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> took its Denomination from the Briti&s;h <HI>Devinam,</HI> &s;ignifying low Valleys, of which this County does very much con&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>Others again, from &s;ome Accidents therein As <HI>Bark&s;hire,</HI> from <HI>Beroc,</HI> a certain place wherein grew good &s;tore of Box; <HI>Rutland,</HI> q. d. Red Land, from the Redne&s;s of its Soil.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t part from the principal Town of the County; as <HI>Gloce&s;ter&s;hire</HI> from <HI>Gloce&s;ter, Oxford&s;hire</HI> from <HI>Oxford, Cambridge&s;hire</HI> from <HI>Cambridge,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<P>Be&s;ides the former Divi&s;ion of England into Counties, there is a common way of dividing it but into Two Parts, <HI>North</HI> and <HI>South,</HI> that is, all the Counties on the North and South-&s;ide of the River Trent.

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>The Advantages</HI> of ENGLAND <HI>from its</HI> Situation, <HI>in oppo&s;ition to Inland Countries. The natural</HI> Beauty <HI>of it. A De&s;cription of its principal</HI> Rivers.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>OF all the <HI>States</HI> of Europe, there's none more happy than <HI>ENGLAND,</HI> whe|ther we con&s;ider the Advantages of its <HI>Situation,</HI> the Temperatene&s;s of its <HI>Air,</HI> the
<PB N="8" REF="24">Richne&s;s of its <HI>Soil,</HI> the happy temper of its <HI>In|habitants,</HI> or the Ble&s;&s;ed Con&s;titution of its <HI>Go|vernment,</HI> e&s;pecially under their pre&s;ent Ma|je&s;ties.</P>
<P>As it is in a manner &s;urrounded by the <HI>Sea,</HI> it injoys Two great <HI>Advantages,</HI> the One in Re|lation to foreign <HI>Trade,</HI> and the Other in point of Security from forein <HI>Inva&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>In relation to forein <HI>Trade,</HI> it lies open to all Parts of the World that are adjacent to the Sea, either for the Exportation of home|bred, or the Importation of foreign Commo|dities. To which purpo&s;e, as Nature has fenced its Sea-Coa&s;ts from the Irruptions and Inunda|tions of the Sea with high <HI>Cliffs,</HI> &s;o &s;he has fur|ni&s;hed it with abundance of &s;afe and capacious <HI>Harbours</HI> for the &s;ecurity of Ships.</P>
<P>As for a forein <HI>Inva&s;ion,</HI> 'tis certain, that I&s;lands of any great Importance, are by Nature the mo&s;t defen&s;ible Places, and the lea&s;t open to Conque&s;ts. The Sea, that fluid Element which &s;urrounds them, is &s;uch a Bar to their E|nemies Attempts; the Winds that govern it, &s;o fickle and uncertain; the Charges of a Fleet and Land Army &s;o va&s;t; the Preparations &s;uch as cannot be carried on with that &s;peed and &s;e|crecy as for an Inva&s;ion by Land; and the Dif|ficulty of Landing &s;o great, in ca&s;e of Oppo&s;i|tion.</P>
<P>'Tis true no Continent perhaps was oftener Conquered than <HI>ENGLAND,</HI> fir&s;t by the <HI>Romans,</HI> then by the <HI>Saxons,</HI> afterwards by the <HI>Danes,</HI> and la&s;t of all by the <HI>Normans.</HI> But how was it done? always by the help of &s;ome di&s;|contented, or corrupted Party in the I&s;land. Thus <HI>Bericus,</HI> a noble (but di&s;gu&s;ted) <HI>Britain,</HI> incouraged <HI>Claudius</HI> the Roman Emperour, to &s;tretch his Empire hither. And <HI>Vortiger</HI> an U&s;ur|per
<PB N="9" REF="24">of the Briti&s;h Throne, called in the Saxons to his help; who, having got a footing here, could not be &s;o ea&s;ily expelled as brought in. In &s;hort, it may be &s;aid, England was never, and can &s;carce be Conquered but by England; e&s;pecially &s;ince its happy Conjunction with <HI>Scot|land,</HI> and the Annexion of <HI>Wales.</HI> As to the late <HI>Revolution,</HI> 'tis &s;elf evident, that the chief Part of the Nation had a hand in it; and as it proved, we may ju&s;tly call it, not an Inva&s;ion, (as King <HI>James</HI> affected to do,) but a wonderful and &s;ignal Deliverance.</P>
<P>To tho&s;e Two great Advantages of <HI>Trade</HI> and <HI>Security,</HI> which England does injoy from its Si|tuation near the Sea, let us add the Pro&s;pect it has from the Sea-Coa&s;t of the wonderful <HI>Ocean,</HI> one of the three great Antiquities of the World; and the plentiful Variety of Fi&s;h, and Sea-Fowl, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it affords to this I&s;land.</P>
<P>But that which rai&s;es my Admiration of <HI>ENGLAND,</HI> is the <HI>Beauty</HI> of it, being gene|rally a flat and open Country, not overgrown with wild and unwhol&s;om Fore&s;ts, nor dreadful high Mountains. What <HI>Hills</HI> it has are gene|rally very gentle and plea&s;ant, and rai&s;ed as it were to give a charming Pro&s;pect to the Eye; as its <HI>Fore&s;ts</HI> &s;eem only contrived for Variety, and the plea&s;ure of Hunting.</P>
<P>But one Thing there is, which adds much to the Beauty of it, and that is its excellent <HI>Verdure.</HI> Which by rea&s;on of the mildne&s;s of the Air, even in the Winter-Sea&s;on, exceeds in dura|tion of Time the mo&s;t fruitful Places of <HI>Eu|rope.</HI></P>
<P>To which add the Concour&s;e of &s;o many <HI>Ri|vers,</HI> which glide through this Country, and &s;trive to make it agreeable and fruitful.</P>

From whence taking its cour&s;e Ea&s;tward, with many Wind|ings and Turnings, it parts <HI>Buckingham&s;hire</HI> from <HI>Bark&s;hire, Middle&s;ex</HI> from <HI>Surrey,</HI> and <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> from <HI>Kent.</HI> Where being &s;welled with the In|flux of &s;everal le&s;&s;er Rivers, it di&s;charges it &s;elf into the Sea; watering by the way, among&s;t o|ther Towns, <HI>Reading</HI> and <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> in Bark&s;hire, <HI>King&s;ton</HI> and <HI>Southwark</HI> in <HI>Surrey, London</HI> in Middle&s;ex, <HI>Barking</HI> in E&s;&s;ex, and <HI>Grave&s;end</HI> in Kent. A River the Water whereof is extra|ordinary whol&s;om, the Stream exceeding gentle, and the Tides very commodious for Naviga|tion. For the Sea flows gently up this River a|bout 80 Miles, almo&s;t as far as <HI>King&s;ton,</HI> being 12 Miles by Land, and 20 by Water, above London.</P>
<P>The <HI>Medway</HI> is a Kenti&s;h River, not &s;o re|markable for the length of its Cour&s;e, as for the Depth of its Channel; and therefore made u&s;e of for harbouring the Royal Navy.

<P>The <HI>Ou&s;e</HI> has its &s;ource in the South-Borders of <HI>Northampton&s;hire.</HI> From whence it runs through the Counties of <HI>Bucks, Bedford, Huntington, Cam|bridge,</HI> and <HI>Norfolk,</HI> where it di&s;charges it &s;elf in|to the Ocean; watering in its Cour&s;e <HI>Bucking|ham, Bedford, Huntington, Ely,</HI> and the Sea-Port of <HI>Lyn</HI> in Norfolk.

<P>The <HI>Trent,</HI> which divides England into Two Parts, North and South, has its Ri&s;e in <HI>Staf|ford&s;hire;</HI> and from thence runs through <HI>Darby|&s;hire, Nottingham&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Lincoln&s;hire,</HI> where it falls into the <HI>Humber</HI> not far from <HI>Hull.</HI> It wa|ters in its cour&s;e the&s;e three chief Places, <HI>Not|tingham, Newark,</HI> and <HI>Gainsborough.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Humber</HI> is a York&s;hire River, if that can be called a di&s;tinct River which has no Spring of its own, but is more properly a Compound (or rather a Mouth) of &s;everal Rivers joyning into one Stream, e&s;pecially the <HI>Trent,</HI> and the <HI>York Ou&s;e,</HI> the <HI>Dun,</HI> and the <HI>Darewent.</HI> The Town of
<PB N="12" REF="26"><HI>Hull</HI> is &s;eated upon it, before which Place it widens it &s;elf (much like the <HI>Severn</HI> at its Mouth) to a great breadth, and &s;o falls into the Sea.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tees</HI> is another River of the North, parting <HI>York&s;hire</HI> from the <HI>Bi&s;hoprick of Dur|ham,</HI> and running from We&s;t to Ea&s;t into the Sea.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tine,</HI> famous for its Coal-trade, parts for &s;ome Miles <HI>Durham</HI> from <HI>Northumberland,</HI> run|ning likewi&s;e from We&s;t to Ea&s;t Seaward, by <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> therefore called <HI>Newca&s;tle upon Tine.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Twede</HI> is the furthe&s;t River Northward, and that which parts <HI>England</HI> from <HI>Scotland.</HI> At the Influx whereof into the Sea is &s;eated <HI>Barwick,</HI> called from this River <HI>Barwick upon Twede.</HI></P>
<P>But, be&s;ides the&s;e principal Rivers, and many others of le&s;s note, though &s;everal of them Na|vigable, I cannot but mention tho&s;e plea&s;ant <HI>Rivulets</HI> and <HI>Brooks</HI> which are &s;o numerous in this Country.

<HEAD>CHAP. III. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the</HI> Air <HI>of</HI> ENGLAND. <HI>Its Temperatene&s;s, and the Effects of it.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>BY the Situation of <HI>ENGLAND,</HI> &s;o far North as it is, one would think the <HI>Air</HI> &s;hould be pretty &s;harp here, and at lea&s;t colder than in France, which lies South from it. Whereas it is &s;o Temperate, Winter and Sum|mer, that the Winters are milder here, and the Summers much more moderate.</P>
<P>In Winter-time the warm Vapours of the Sea on every &s;ide do &s;o thicken the <HI>Air,</HI> that it can|not &s;o &s;oon penetrate as the thin Air of hot Countries. In Summer the frequent Interpo&s;i|tion of Clouds, often di&s;&s;olving into Rain, and the u&s;ual Bla&s;ts from the Sea, allay tho&s;e ex|ce&s;&s;ive Heats, which both hot and cold Cli|mates are troubled with in that Sea&s;on, for want of Wind and Rain.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>ENGLAND</HI> has the happine&s;s of being &s;eldom tired, either with a long <HI>Fro&s;t</HI> in Winter, or <HI>Drought</HI> in Summer. On the con|trary, while Continents in the &s;ame Latitude, and &s;ome of a much more Southern Situation, ly under Snow, pinched with a hard Fro&s;t, it happens often that our Fields are here cloathed with Gra&s;s, as in the Spring. And whil&s;t the Sun in Summer &s;corches the Plants, and the In|habitants them&s;elves of hot Climates, here it &s;hines &s;o kindly, that it does but warm us by
<PB N="14" REF="27">a moderate Heat, which makes the Country &s;o plentiful both of Corn and Pa&s;ture.</P>
<P>'Tis true, on the other &s;ide, the Air is no|thing &s;o pure, nor the Weather &s;o &s;erene, or regular, as it is in Continents. Mo&s;t part of the Winter <HI>ENGLAND</HI> is under a Cloud, often &s;tuffed up with Fogs, troubled with rainy Weather, and (except there happens a Fro&s;t) but &s;eldom injoying the Sun in its &s;plendour. Whence proceed tho&s;e frequent <HI>Colds,</HI> which are in a manner the original Cau&s;e of mo&s;t of our Di&s;tempers; and from the frequency of Rain, <HI>Land-floods,</HI> which drown the Countries where the Rivers &s;well out of their Channels, and break over their Banks.</P>
<P>And yet, as rainy as this Country is, we &s;el|dom &s;ee here &s;uch impetuous Showers (or rather Storms) of Rain, as hot Countries are &s;ubject to, which often drown the faire&s;t Hopes of the Husbandman. For, if they have Rain but &s;el|dom, they have it by the great, and &s;ometimes with a Vengeance. Whereas in England, where it is more frequent, it proves mo&s;t com|monly a gentle &s;oaking Rain.</P>
<P>But there is another Inconveniency in the Weather here, and that is its <HI>Changeablene&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Irregularity,</HI> according to the Wind that blows. Which happens &s;ometimes to be &s;o fre|quent and &s;udden, that in the &s;pace of 24 hours I have ob&s;erved four different &s;orts of Weather, proper enough for the four Sea&s;ons of the Year. This I confe&s;s, is an extraordinary Ca&s;e. But however &s;uch is the Mutablene&s;s of the Wea|ther, that it &s;eldom holds out many Days in the &s;ame degree, either of Warmth, Coldne&s;s, or Drine&s;s. And of all Times of the Year, the Month of March is the mo&s;t &s;ubject to Change, witne&s;s the u&s;ual Expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>March Many-wea|ther.</HI></P>
<PB N="15" REF="27">
<P>And yet this may be &s;aid for Changeablene&s;s of Weather, that it creates Diver&s;ion by its Variety. What is more comfortable in Win|ter than a warm Day after a fit of cold Wea|ther; and a cool Day in Summer, after a fit of hot Weather? The quicke&s;t and mo&s;t re|fined Plea&s;ures grow dull by their Continuance, but Change &s;ets an edge upon 'em. And, as glorious as the Sun appears in its greate&s;t &s;plendour, I have oftentimes been weary of its undi&s;continued Appearance for a long time to|gether.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide <HI>ENGLAND</HI> is nothing near &s;o &s;ubject to <HI>Hail,</HI> to <HI>Thunder,</HI> and <HI>Lightning,</HI> or to the Heavens darting of <HI>Thunderbolts,</HI> as many other Regions, which are frequently a|larmed with tho&s;e dreadful Meteors.</P>
<P>And, if Nature be &s;omewhat too prodigal of Moi&s;ture in this Country, &s;he is on the other &s;ide as careful to cure it. Scarce a fit of Rain is over, but comes a fit of <HI>Wind</HI> to dry up the Moi&s;ture, and purify the Air. So that the mo&s;t part of the Year is commonly divided be|twixt the&s;e two Gods of the Heathens, <HI>Jupiter</HI> and <HI>Aeolus.</HI></P>
<P>The Wind that reigns mo&s;t in <HI>ENGLAND</HI> is the <HI>We&s;terly Wind,</HI> which blows from the va&s;t We&s;tern Ocean perhaps three parts in four of the Year. But when I &s;ay a We&s;terly Wind, I don't mean only that which blows directly from the Cardinal Point, but all the Collateral Points from South to North.</P>
<P>An <HI>Ea&s;terly Wind,</HI> e&s;pecially in the Spring, is lookt upon here to be fatal to Plants; and if the Proverb be true, to Man and Bea&s;t.</P>
<P>For <HI>high Winds,</HI> and <HI>tempe&s;tuous Weather,</HI> we have here two Times of the Year, &s;eldom free from it. And tho&s;e are the two Equinoxes,
<PB N="16" REF="28">in September and March. But for <HI>Hurricanes,</HI> and <HI>Earthquakes,</HI> England of all the Countries in Europe, is the lea&s;t &s;ubject to 'em. The Storm indeed which hapned on the 12th of Ja|nuary la&s;t, was &s;o very violent, blew with &s;uch impetuous Gu&s;ts, and proved &s;o mi&s;chievous, that it may pa&s;s for an Hurricane. But it was &s;uch as the like has not been known here within the Memory of Man.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, whatever be the Di&s;advantages of <HI>ENGLAND</HI> in point of <HI>Air,</HI> in re&s;pect to other Countries, the &s;ame is &s;ufficiently coun|tervailed by the Sweetne&s;s and Comforts of it, as 'twill further appear by the in&s;uing Chap|ter.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the</HI> Products <HI>of</HI> ENGLAND, <HI>both from the Land and Water, and the</HI> Fruitfulne&s;s <HI>thereof.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>'TIS &s;aid of Henry the Seventh, one of the wi&s;e&s;t Kings that ever &s;at upon the Throne of England, but who&s;e Breeding had been low and private, That, be|ing once pre&s;&s;ed by &s;ome of his Council to pur|&s;ue his Title to France, he returned this An|&s;wer; 'Tis true, &s;ays he, France <HI>is a noble and gallant Kingdom, but</HI> England <HI>in my mind is as fine a Seat for a Country Gentleman as any is in Europe.</HI></P>
<P>I pa&s;s by the Reflection; and taking his An|&s;wer in a plain literal Sen&s;e, I own, that En|gland
<PB N="17" REF="28">is, in mo&s;t Things, one of the fine&s;t and be&s;t Countries in Europe. I have already de|mon&s;trated wherein its Beauty con&s;i&s;ts, and now the Subject of this Chapter &s;hall be its Plentifulne&s;s.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t for <HI>Corn,</HI> either for Man or Bea&s;t, it may cerainly outvy mo&s;t Countries in Eu|rope; As it may for <HI>Pasture,</HI> which makes the Cattel thrive here exceedingly. And, though here be many Heaths, yet they are not &s;o barren, but that they afford wherewithall to feed a World of Sheep.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>ENGLAND</HI> yields, not only Plen|ty of <HI>Corn,</HI> to make Bread and Drink with, &amp;c. but al&s;o abundance of all manner of <HI>Cattle,</HI> for whole&s;om &s;ub&s;tantial Food; with plenty of <HI>Salt, Chee&s;e,</HI> and <HI>Butter.</HI> For Dainties and Variety, 'tis &s;tocked with <HI>Fallow Deer,</HI> beyond any part of Europe. <HI>Hares</HI> and <HI>Conies,</HI> tame and wild <HI>Fowl,</HI> eatable <HI>Roots</HI> and <HI>Herbs, Fruits</HI> of mo&s;t &s;orts it has abundance of. And &s;o con&s;tant is the Continuance of the&s;e Things in England, by rea&s;on of the Clemency of the Air, that it has not felt a Famine for &s;everal Ages.</P>
<P>The Sea and Rivers, on the other &s;ide, fur|ni&s;h it with plenty of all manner of <HI>Fi&s;h,</HI> as <HI>Herrings, Mackerels, Whitings, Pilchards, Soles, Plaices, Flounders, Cods, Salmons, Sturgeons, Lampreys, Congers, Turbots, Thornbaeks, Loh&s;ters,</HI> and <HI>Oysters,</HI> &amp;c. the&s;e la&s;t being famous, a|mong the old Romans, for their extraordinary goodne&s;s. Here is al&s;o abundance of <HI>Carps. Pikes, Perches, Trouts, Gudgeons, Tenches, Roaches, Daces, Breams, Eeles, Cray-fi&s;h,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Spices</HI> we have, as all the re&s;t of Europe, from the Ea&s;t and We&s;t-Indies; and from this la&s;t, that inchanting Commodity which has got &s;o
<PB N="18" REF="29">much the vogue here, I mean <HI>Tobacco.</HI> Not but that the Engli&s;h Soil can bear it plenti|fully, as has been found by Experience; but, becau&s;e it is more proper, for &s;everal Rea&s;ons of State, to fetch it at that di|&s;tance.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, what other Things <HI>ENGLAND</HI> wants, whether for delight or fancy, are ea&s;i|ly &s;upplied by Sea from tho&s;e Countries where they grow; which either exchange 'em fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Mony, or &s;uch Commodities of our Growth as we can &s;pare, and they &s;tand in need of.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Wine,</HI> 'tis &s;aid indeed the South Parts of <HI>ENGLAND,</HI> as <HI>Kent</HI> and <HI>Hamp|&s;hire</HI> among&s;t others, have had formerly great Numbers of Vineyards, and (as the Summe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> proved) made of them tolerable Wine. But &s;ince better Wine could be had from o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Neighbours at an ea&s;ier rate, the Vineyard were laid a&s;ide, and the Soil turned to bette<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> account. And yet, when the Sea&s;on does an|&s;wer to the &s;ingular Care and Indu&s;try of the Husbandman, I may &s;ay this without Pre|judice, and from my own Experience, that England then affords in &s;ome Places as good and delicious <HI>Grapes</HI> as mo&s;t Parts of France. The &s;ame I may aver of &s;ome other Fruits, as <HI>Peache<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> among&s;t others; but then I mu&s;t confe&s;s, Ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> has a great hand in it.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, The want of Wine is otherwi&s;e &s;up|plied by <HI>Beer</HI> and <HI>Ale,</HI> the u&s;ual Drinks of the Country. Which, rightly made, is as whole|&s;om a Liquour, though not &s;o cheerful, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Wine.</P>
<P>Now for <HI>Rayment,</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Wool</HI> is famous all over the World, both for its finene&s;s and
<PB N="19" REF="29">goodne&s;s. But that of <HI>Cot&s;wold</HI> in Gloce&s;ter|&s;hire, of <HI>Lem&s;ter</HI> in Hereford&s;hire, and of the I&s;le of <HI>Wight,</HI> has the pre-eminency. Of this Wool are made excellent broad <HI>Cloths,</HI> di&s;per&s;ed not only all over England, but all over the World, e&s;pecially high Germany, Poland, Mo&s;|covy, Turky, and Per&s;ia, to the great bene|fit of this Kingdom. For the advancing of which Manufacture, that nece&s;&s;ary Earth, called <HI>Fullers-Earth,</HI> is no where el&s;e produ|ced in that abundance and excellency as in En|gland.</P>
<P>For <HI>Flax</HI> and <HI>Hemp,</HI> to make <HI>Linnen</HI> of, here is a great deal of good and proper Soil; which I wonder &s;hould not be improved for that purpo&s;e, rather than have &s;o much <HI>Lin|nen</HI> imported as there is from beyond Sea. But, as for <HI>Leather,</HI> here's great Plenty of it, and &s;uch as is excellent for all manner of U&s;e. And, as England does &s;warm with <HI>Conies,</HI> their Furs go a great way for the making of Hats.</P>
<P><HI>Silks</HI> al&s;o might be here produced, as it was once de&s;igned by King James the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>For other nece&s;&s;ary Conveniences, as for building of <HI>Hou&s;es, ENGLAND</HI> wants not Materials, except &s;uch <HI>Timber</HI> as comes from Norway. For <HI>Firing,</HI> here is indeed in mo&s;t Places a Scarcity of <HI>Wood;</HI> but that Defect is abundantly &s;upplied by the <HI>Coal-Mines.</HI></P>
<P>For <HI>Shipping,</HI> no where better <HI>Oak.</HI> For <HI>Land-Carriage,</HI> Plenty of good &s;tout Hor&s;es. For <HI>Hunting,</HI> or <HI>Racing,</HI> &s;uch as are incompara|ble. And for <HI>Beauty</HI> or <HI>Finene&s;s,</HI> &s;carce any Country like this.</P>
<P><HI>Dogs</HI> of all &s;orts, &s;izes, and u&s;es are al&s;o to be found here. Among&s;t which the <HI>Mastiffs,</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="30">whether Bear or Bull-dogs, are extraordinary, the fir&s;t for their Size, and both for their Stoutne&s;s. Our <HI>Spaniels</HI> al&s;o, and all &s;orts of <HI>Hounds</HI> for Hunting, are of great reque&s;t be|yond Sea.</P>
<P>For <HI>Smell</HI> and <HI>Ornament,</HI> here all &s;orts of <HI>Flowers,</HI> even tho&s;e that come from the remo|te&s;t Countries, thrive to admiration. But no Region perhaps abounds like this in <HI>Laurel</HI> and <HI>Ro&s;emary,</HI> two remarkable Plants for their perpetual Greenne&s;s.</P>
<P>For <HI>Phy&s;ical &V;&s;es,</HI> it &s;carce wants any <HI>Simple.</HI> Here grows plenty of excellent <HI>Saffron</HI> and <HI>Li|cori&s;h;</HI> neither does it want <HI>Hony</HI> or <HI>Wax,</HI> of the be&s;t fort. Here are al&s;o <HI>hot Baths,</HI> and abundance of <HI>Medicinal Springs.</HI></P>
<P>I come now to tho&s;e inexhau&s;tible Trea|&s;ures of <HI>Coals, Lead, Copper, Tin,</HI> and <HI>Iron,</HI> which are dug out of the Bowels of the Earth in this Kingdom. The <HI>Coal-mines</HI> do chiefly in|rich Newca&s;tle in Northumberland, from whence a great part of the Kingdom is &s;up|plied with Coals for Fewel; without which it could not po&s;&s;ibly &s;ub&s;i&s;t, &s;o great is the Decay of Woods, and the Neglect of plant|ing.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lead-Mines</HI> are mo&s;t con&s;iderable in the Peak of Derby&s;hire; and tho&s;e of <HI>Tin</HI> in Cornwal, where they dig Tin not much infe|riour to Silver in finene&s;s. Here are al&s;o <HI>Cop|per-Mines,</HI> but herein Cumberland does exceed it. As for the <HI>Mines</HI> of <HI>Iron,</HI> 'tis true they bring more Damage to the Publick by the Spoil of Woods, than the Profit that accrues thereby to private Per&s;ons amounts to.</P>
<P>Here are al&s;o <HI>Silver-Mines,</HI> as in <HI>Cornwal, Lanca&s;hire,</HI> and the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Durham,</HI> richer than the very Mines of Poto&s;i, in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="30">whence the King of Spain has mo&s;t of his Silver. For, whereas the&s;e yield u&s;ually but one Ounce and a half of Silver in one hun|dred Ounces of Oar, our Engli&s;h Mines com|monly yield &s;ix or eight Ounces per Cent. 'Tis true ours lying deeper, and harder to come unto, and the Workmen being dear (which is otherwi&s;e in <HI>Poto&s;i,</HI>) all the&s;e things concurring together, are like to &s;ecure them from any further Attempt.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, though &s;ome Countries excel <HI>ENGLAND</HI> in &s;ome Things, yet this may be &s;aid of it in general; That there is &s;carce any Country, who&s;e Fields are better &s;tored with all &s;ort of <HI>Corn;</HI> the Pa&s;tures, with <HI>Cat|tel;</HI> the Woods, and Forre&s;ts, Parks, and War|rens, with <HI>wild Bea&s;ts,</HI> only for Recreation and Food; the Air with <HI>Birds</HI> and <HI>Fowls;</HI> the Seas and Rivers, with <HI>Fi&s;hes;</HI> and the Mines with <HI>Coals</HI> and <HI>Metals.</HI></P>
<P>On the other &s;ide, there is &s;carce a Coun|try &s;o little troubled with <HI>hurtful</HI> and <HI>ravenous Beasts,</HI> with <HI>venomous Serpents,</HI> or noi&s;om <HI>Flies</HI> and <HI>Vermine.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wolves,</HI> which of all ravenous Bea&s;ts are the mo&s;t pernicious and de&s;tructive of Cattel, have been &s;o wonderfully extirpated out of this Land, that I cannot omit the Hi&s;tory of it. I know it has been a Tradition of old Writers, that <HI>England</HI> never had any <HI>Wolves</HI> at all, and that being brought hither from other Places, they would not live. But Hi&s;tory tells us the contrary, here being abundance of them, till King <HI>Edgar</HI> commuted for 300 Wolves the yearly Tribute paid him by the Prince of Wales. Which made the Welch &s;o indu&s;trious and active in Wolf-hunting, that the Wolves were in time quite rooted out of the Land,
<PB N="22" REF="31">the Welch prote&s;ting at la&s;t, they could find no more of 'em.</P>
<P>Whereby 'tis come to pa&s;s, that whereas in other Countries they are at the Charge and Trouble of guarding their Sheep, and hou&s;ing them by night, here they are left feeding in the Fields day and night, &s;ecure from any Danger, unle&s;s it be &s;ometimes from <HI>Men-Wolves,</HI> or Sheep-&s;tealers.</P>
<P>And yet I am credibly informed, that in &s;ome Places, as Warwick&s;hire among the re&s;t, &s;ome Wolves from time to time have been di&s;covered. But, as it happens but &s;el|dom, &s;o upon the lea&s;t notice the Country ri&s;es amain, as it were again&s;t a common Ene|my; there being &s;uch a hue and cry after the Wolf, that it is hard for him to e&s;cape the <HI>Po&s;&s;e Comitatus.</HI></P>

<P>This I&s;land runs in <HI>Length,</HI> from North to South, about 30 miles; and in <HI>Breadth,</HI> where it is broade&s;t, 10 miles.

<P>The <HI>Air</HI> of this I&s;land is &s;harp, and &s;ubject to high Winds; but 'tis healthful. And, as &s;harp as it is in Winter, yet the Fro&s;ts are &s;hort, and the Snow does not ly very long in the Val|leys.</P>
<P>The <HI>Soil</HI> is pretty fruitful, both in Corn and Pa&s;ture; affording good &s;tore of Wheat and o|ther Grain, and feeding good Flocks of Sheep and Herds of Cattle, but none of the bigge&s;t &s;ize.

<P>Next to the River <HI>Trent,</HI> wherewith the South Parts of it are irrigated, that of chief note is <HI>Derwent,</HI> which cro&s;&s;ing the Country from North to South, empties it &s;elf into the <HI>Trent,</HI> and &s;o divides the County into Ea&s;t and We&s;t.</P>
<P>The <HI>Soil,</HI> in the South and Ea&s;t Parts, is ve|ry fruitful, and yields both good Gra&s;s and Corn. But the North and We&s;t Parts, being both Hilly and Stony, with a black and mo&s;&s;y barren Ground, are not &s;o fertile. Yet they are not without &s;ome rich Valleys; and on the Hills them&s;elves are bred abundance of very good (though not very large) Sheep.</P>
<P>For <HI>Fewel,</HI> it is not beholden to Wood, the Woods having been de&s;troyed in a great mea|&s;ure by the Countries Iron-Works, Lead-mines, and Coal-Delfs. But 'tis &s;o well &s;tored with Coals, that it &s;upplies with this &s;ort of Fewel many neighbouring Counties, as Leice&s;ter, Nor|thampton, Rutland, and Lincoln. Who&s;e In|habitants frequently bring Barley to &s;ell at Darby, and load them&s;elves back with Coals.</P>
<P>For <HI>Buildings,</HI> it affords, not only good Clay for Bricks, but al&s;o &s;tore of Free-Stone, or du|rable Greet Stone; and in many parts Lime|&s;tone, both u&s;eful in Building, and for manu|ring the Ground. Here is al&s;o Alaba&s;ter, Cry|&s;tal, black and grey Marble, not only very du|rable, but &s;uch as poli&s;hes well.</P>
<P>As for Mill-Stones, and Whet-&s;tones, here's whole <HI>Quarries</HI> of 'em; in the working where|of a great many hands are imployed, before they come to be di&s;per&s;ed over the Nation.</P>
<P>But the chiefe&s;t Commodity of this Country is <HI>Lead,</HI> which for goodne&s;s or Plenty yields to no Place in the World. Famous for this is
<PB N="55" REF="47">the Peak of Derby&s;hire, as well as for its Quar|ries; but particularly for its three wonderful Caves.</P>
<P>This <HI>Peak</HI> ly's among&s;t the Mountains, in the North-We&s;t Parts; and its three Caves, of a wonderful va&s;t height, length, and depth, are known by the Names of <HI>Devils Ar&s;e, Elden|hole,</HI> and <HI>Pools hole.</HI> From the <HI>Devils Ar&s;e</HI> a Water comes, which is &s;aid to ebb and flow 4 times in an hour, (as the Well in the Peak Fo|re&s;t) and to keep its ju&s;t Tides.

<P>But the greate&s;t Wonder of all is that of <HI>Buxton-Wells.</HI> Nine Springs ari&s;e out of a Rock in the compa&s;s of 8 or 9 Yards, eight of which are warm, and the ninth very cold. The&s;e Springs run from under a &s;quare Building of Free Stone, and about 300 foot off receive an|other hot Spring from a Well inclo&s;ed with four flat Stones; near unto which another very cold Spring bubbles up.

<P>This Town is &s;eated upon the We&s;t Bank of <HI>Derwent</HI> (from whence probably the Name of <HI>Derby</HI> is extracted) over which there is a fine Bridge of free Stone, and upon the Bridge a Chap|pel called St. Maries Chappel.

<P>'Tis a large, populous, and rich Place, few inland Towns equalizing it. Here are five Pari&s;h Churches, of which that of All-Saints is the faire&s;t. Who&s;e Tower-Steeple (in which are 8 tunable Bells) built at the only Charge of the young Men and Maids about the Reign of Q. Mary, is equalled for height and beauty by few in the Nation.

<P><HI>DEVONSHIRE,</HI> a Maritime County in the We&s;t of England, lies open to the Sea, both Northward and Southward; on the <HI>North</HI> being bounded with the North Sea, otherwi&s;e called the Severn Sea, or S.

But <HI>Ea&s;tward</HI> it is bounded by Somer&s;et&s;hire and Dor&s;et&s;hire; and <HI>We&s;tward,</HI> by Cornwal.</P>
<P>It contains in <HI>Length,</HI> from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, a|bout 52 miles; in <HI>Breadth,</HI> from North to South, 46. The whole divided into 33 <HI>Hundreds,</HI> wherein 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">4 <HI>Pari&s;hes,</HI> and 32 <HI>Market Towns.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Air</HI> of this County is &s;harp and whole|&s;om.

<P>This City is &s;o called from the River <HI>Ex,</HI> on the Ea&s;t-banks whereof it is &s;eated, and over which it has a fair Stone bridge, not above 12 or 15 miles from its fall into the Sea.

<P>Next to the <HI>Severn,</HI> which cro&s;&s;es the Coun|try from North to South, here's the <HI>Avon</HI> which parts it from Somer&s;et&s;hire, the <HI>Wye</HI> which &s;evers it in part from Monmouth&s;hire, be&s;ides the <HI>Stroud</HI> and the <HI>I&s;is.</HI> All which afford great plenty of Fi&s;h, and the <HI>Severn</HI> particularly abundance of Salmon.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fore&s;t</HI> of <HI>Dean,</HI> which ly's in the We&s;t|&s;ide of the County between the Severn and the Wye, is reckoned to be 20 miles long, and 10 broad.

<P><HI>Gloce&s;ter,</HI> the County Town, is 81 miles di|&s;tant We&s;t and by North from London.

<P>A City of good Antiquity, and fir&s;t built by the Romans, to whom it was known by the Name of <HI>Glevum.</HI> It ly's &s;tretch|ed out in length on the Severn, over which it has a fine Bridge, and on the Banks thereof a large Key or Wharf, very commodious for the Merchandize and Trade of the Place. The Streets are generally fair, and the Town well built upon an ea&s;y A&s;cent, the Streets de&s;cending every way from the Cro&s;s. It has been for|merly walled about with a &s;trong Wall, except on the Rivers &s;ide; and &s;ome Remains of its Walls are &s;till in many places to be &s;een, which &s;hew what &s;trength they were of.</P>
<PB N="86" REF="63">
<P>The City is not very large, but very well in|habited and frequented, and enjoying a good Trade. It has two Markets a Week, <HI>viz. Wed|ne&s;days</HI> and <HI>Saturdays,</HI> which are very great for Corn and Cattle, and well &s;erved with all Pro|vi&s;ions. And, for Divine Wor&s;hip, here are twelve Pari&s;h-Churches; be&s;ides the Cathedral, a fine piece of Architecture, noted among&s;t o|ther things for its <HI>Whi&s;pering Place,</HI> which is in an Arch of the Quire? but chiefly for be|ing the Burying-place of <HI>Lucius,</HI> the fir&s;t Chri|&s;tian King; and of the unfortunate King <HI>Ed|ward</HI> II. who at Barkley-Ca&s;tle was barbarou&s;ly murdered by the Cruelty of I&s;abel his Wife.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, this City is both a Bi&s;hops See, and a County of it &s;elf, being made a County by King Richard III, once Duke of Gloce&s;ter. And, as it has the advantage of denominating &s;o rich a Country as this, &s;o it has been of|ten dignified with the Title of a Dukedom, &s;ometimes that of an Earldom, in tho&s;e eminent Per&s;ons who in their &s;everal Times and Ages have been either Dukes or Earls of <HI>Gloce&s;ter.</HI> The Number of 'em is too great for me to produce 'em all here. Therefore I &s;hall only &s;ay, that the la&s;t Duke of <HI>Gloce&s;ter</HI> was <HI>Henry,</HI> the third Son of King Charles I, declared by his Royal Father Duke of <HI>Gloce&s;ter,</HI> and Earl of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and &s;o Intituled Anno 1641, but not &s;o created till the Year 1659. He lived to &s;ee the Re&s;tauration of the Royal Family, and died the &s;ame Year it hapned, viz. Sept. 13. 1660.

It is both plea&s;antly and commodiou&s;ly &s;eat|ed at the fall of the <HI>Frome</HI> into the <HI>Avon,</HI> which five Miles from thence empties it &s;elf into the Severn. By this River the City is divided in|to two Parts, the chief Part in Gloce&s;ter|&s;hire, and the other in Somer&s;et&s;hire, but with the conveniency of Communication by means of a fair Stone Bridge. Which (like London Bridge) is &s;o covered with Hou&s;es, that it looks more like a Street than a Bridge. Its Streets are neatly ordered, and &s;et out with many fine Edifices. Among which may be reckoned the Cathedral, and mo&s;t of the Pari&s;h Churches, which are 18 in Number. The City is be|girt with a Wall, be&s;ides other Fortifi|cations. At the Ea&s;t end of it &s;tood a Ca&s;tle, wherein King Stephen was kept a Pri&s;oner by Maud the Empre&s;s. But it was demoli&s;h|ed by Oliver Cromwel, and is now built in|to Streets, called Ca&s;tle-&s;treet and Ca&s;tle-Green.</P>
<P>But that which has chiefly made <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> &s;o con&s;iderable is the goodne&s;s of its Port. The principal Key whereof &s;tands on the <HI>Frome,</HI> which at Spring-Tides does flow about 40 Foot, and &s;o brings Ships in of a great Burden. Thus <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> by its Commodiou&s;|ne&s;s for Shipping, is become a Place of great Re&s;ort both for Merchants and Trade&s;men; tho&s;e driving a great Trade to mo&s;t Parts of the Known World, the&s;e a Home-Trade, e&s;|pecially to Wales, to Shrop&s;hire, and other Counties.</P>
<P>About <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> is great &s;tore of Coals; al&s;o, a &s;ort of Precious Stone, called from thence <HI>Bri&s;tol-Stones,</HI> taken out of S. Vincents Rock.

<P>La&s;tly, though <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> &s;tands partly (as I &s;aid before) in this County, and partly in Somer|&s;et&s;hire; yet, as it is a County of it &s;elf, it yields Obedience to neither.

<P>'Tis but about 150 Years &s;ince this Town came to he a Bi&s;hops See, this being one of the &s;ix new Sees erected by Henry VIII. by virtue of an Act of Parliament made in order to it.

<P><HI>Cirence&s;ter,</HI> commonly pronounced <HI>Circe&s;ter,</HI> is &s;eated on the River <HI>Churn,</HI> over which it has a Bridge.

This City was taken from the Britains by the We&s;t-Saxons, and afterwards po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Mercians, till laid in A&s;hes by a Stratagem of the mercile&s;s Danes, in tying fire to the Wings of Sparrows, from whence it came to be called the <HI>Sparrows City.</HI> Since which De&s;olation, it could never recover it &s;elf to any thing beyond the Name of a good Borough Town.</P>

But mo&s;t of all memorable for the Battel fought here Anno 1471. between King <HI>Henry</HI> VI. and his immediate Succe&s;&s;or Edward IV, that is, between the Hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter and York, where the Lanca&s;trians were intire|ly defeated, and the young Prince Edward (the only Son of King Henry) &s;lain.</P>

<P><HI>Southampton,</HI> the Shire-Town, bears from London South-We&s;t by We&s;t, and is di&s;tant therefrom 60 miles, thus.

<P>This Town is commodiou&s;ly &s;eated at the very Mouth of the Rivers Te&s;t and Itching both which Streams being here united together into one go under the Name of <HI>Hampton,</HI> which is more like an Arm of the Sea than a River. And 'tis capable of Ships of good Burden to the very Key, which is very com|modious for lading and unlading of Ships. Ac|cordingly this Town has flouri&s;hed for &s;ome time, and injoy'd a great Trade with France
<PB N="93" REF="66">e&s;pecially; being conveniently &s;eated, oppo|&s;ite to Normandy, and its adjacent I&s;les, Jer|&s;ey and Garn&s;ey.

At pre&s;ent both its Trade and Strength are very much decay'd and dimini&s;hed. How|ever it is &s;till of that extent as to contain five Pari&s;h Churches.

<P>The Bi&s;hops of Winche&s;ter were anciently reputed to be Earls of <HI>Southampton,</HI> and are &s;o &s;tiled in the new Statutes of the Garter made by Henry VIII.

<PB N="94" REF="67">Itching. A City of great Antiquity, and noted among the Romans for being the Place where the rich Imbroideries were made for their Emperours. In the time of the Saxons it was twice con&s;umed by fire, and by them rebuilt; being made the Royal Seat of the We&s;t-Saxon Kings, and the chief Epi&s;copal See. Afterwards it felt, with many other Places, the fury of the Danes. In the time of the Normans it was repaired, and honoured with the keeping of the publick Records of the Kingdom. But &s;oon after it had a Relap&s;e, be|ing &s;ore oppre&s;&s;ed during the Civil Wars of Maud the Empre&s;s and King Stephen. At la&s;t it began in the Reign of Edward III. to reco|ver it &s;elf, having made it the Mart for Wool and Cloth.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent this City contains, within its Walls, about a mile and a half in Circuit, but not without &s;ome wa&s;te.

<P>For Divine Wor&s;hip, here are five Pari&s;h Churches.

For the Education of Youth, here is in the Suburbs a fair Colledge, liberally endowed, and a place of good Lite|rature; built and endowed by <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Wickham</HI> for a Seminary to his other Colledge in Oxford. And for the Relief of the Poor, a very fair Ho&s;pital, called S. <HI>Cro&s;les,</HI> not far off from the Colledge. Here is al&s;o a goodly and capacious Palace for the Bi&s;hops Dwel|ling,

<P>The Soil hereof abundantly an&s;wers the Pains of the Husband man.

<P>This I&s;land is divided into two principal Parts, <HI>viz. Ea&s;t,</HI> and <HI>We&s;t-Meden;</HI> containing 36 <HI>Pari&s;hes,</HI> and in them 3 <HI>Market-Towns.</HI></P>

<P>At <HI>Kyneton,</HI> a pretty large and well-built Town, they drive a good I rade for narrow Cloths; and the Market is counted the be&s;t for Corn, Cattle, Provi&s;ions, and &s;everal other Commodities, e&s;pecially the Wedne&s;days before Chri&s;tmas, Ea&s;ter, and Whit&s;untide.</P>
<P><HI>Ledbury;</HI> &s;eated near the <HI>Malvern Hills,</HI> in a rich Clay Ground, is a well built Town, and much inhabited by Clothiers, who drive a good Trade here.</P>
<P>Among the Things remarkable in this Coun|ty, here is fir&s;t, by Snod-hill Ca&s;tle, a Quar|ry of excellent Marble.

<P>Neither can I omit to relate the Story of <HI>Mar&s;ley Hill,</HI> tho' I could &s;carce give credit to it, were it not related both by Cambden and Speed, two Authentick Authors. This Hill, in the Year 1571, removed it &s;elf with a roar|ing noi&s;e from the place where it &s;tood, and for 3 days together travelled from its old Seat. It began this Motion on Saturday the 7th of February about 6 a Clock at Night, and by 7 a Clock the next Morning it had gone about 200 Foot; carrying with it Sheep in their

<P>In former time this County was very Woody, being counted a Fore&s;t, and &s;uch as afforded excellent Game for Hunting, from whence it took its Denomination.

<P>But the <HI>Air</HI> is neither &s;o &s;erene, nor &s;o health|ful here, as in other Counties, e&s;pecially near the Sea and Mar&s;hes; which makes this Coun|try
<PB N="110" REF="75">&s;o noted for its Kenti&s;h Agues. Now, that you may know in few words the Nature of this Country, both as to its Air and Soil, I &s;hall bring in the Remark made upon it, which is, that there are 3 Ridges of Hills in Kent, one called Health without Wealth, the &s;econd Health and Wealth, and the third Wealth without Health. Others, as to the Soil, give this different Character of it. <HI>The Weald</HI> for Wood, <HI>Ea&s;t Kent</HI> for Corn, <HI>Rumney</HI> for Meadow, <HI>Tenham</HI> for an Orchard, <HI>Shepey</HI> and <HI>Reculver</HI> for Wheat, <HI>Thanet</HI> for Barley, and <HI>Hed|corn</HI> for Capons.</P>
<P>In general this may be &s;aid of Kent, that it is a Country very good for Corn, and fit for Pa&s;turage, according to the &s;everal Plots and Parts thereof; and wondrous full of fruitful and well-ordered Orchards, from whence the City of London is &s;upplied with mo&s;t &s;orts of Fruit, but chiefly with Pippins and Cherries, which are counted the be&s;t in England. On the Cliffs between Deal and Dover, there grows a great &s;tore of Samphire.</P>
<P>The &s;ame is well watered with <HI>Rivers.</HI> For, be&s;ides the <HI>Thames</HI> that wa&s;hes its North Parts, here is the <HI>Medway,</HI> which in a manner parts it in the middle, the <HI>Stower</HI> that runs by Can|terbury, the <HI>Tun</HI> through Tunbridge, and the <HI>Rother</HI> upon which Appledore is &s;eated, not to mention the <HI>le&s;&s;er Streams.</HI></P>
<P>Of all the Counties in England, this was the fir&s;t Kingdom of the Heptarchy, and had a par|ticular King to it &s;elf, which no other County ever had. Neither was it conquered by the Normans, the Kenti&s;h Men yielding upon Ar|ticles, and having their ancient Franchi&s;es and Cu&s;toms confirmed to 'em by William the Con|queror. One of which is the <HI>Cavelkind,</HI> where|by

Al&s;o, the Son (tho of a convicted Father for Felony or Murder) &s;ucceeds him in &s;uch Kind of Lands.</P>
<P>The Kenti&s;h Men be&s;ides have this to glo|ry in, that they were the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians of this I&s;land. And this is the only County at this time that has two Cities, or Epi&s;copal Sees, namely Canterbury and Roche&s;ter.</P>

<P>A City of great Antiquity, if it was built (as &s;ome Authors aver) 900 years before Chri&s;t.

Whereupon the King re|moved his Seat to <HI>Reculver,</HI> a Town by the Sea|&s;ide.

The Town is large, and well inhabited; and its Markets well &s;erved with Provi&s;ions. But it is counted an Agui&s;h Place. Here was ere|cted an Abbey by King Stephen where him|&s;elf, his Queen, and Eu&s;tace his Son were bu|ried. Of late years it has been dignified with the Title of an Earldom, in the Per&s;on of the Right Honourable <HI>Lewis de Duras,</HI> Earl of Fever&s;ham, &amp;c.

<HEAD>The Kenti&s;h I&s;les, <HI>Thanet</HI> and <HI>Shepey.</HI></HEAD>
<P>In the North-Ea&s;t Parts of Kent, near <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">andwich, is an I&s;land called <HI>Thanet,</HI> &s;ur|rounded on all &s;ides with the Sea, except We&s;t|ward, where it is &s;evered from the main Land by the River Stoure, here called Yenlade; but &s;o, that, by the benefit of a Cau&s;ey and Pa&s;&s;age for the Waters in convenient Places, it is united to the Continent (or main Land) of Kent. This I&s;land called by the Saxons <HI>Thanet,</HI> from <HI>Thanatos,</HI> or <HI>Athanatos,</HI> by which Name it is found in <HI>Solinus,</HI> is about 9 Miles in length, and 8 in breadth at the broade&s;t.</P>
<P>An I&s;land plentifully &s;tored with Provi&s;ions, but Corn e&s;pecially; and withall very popu|lous. Famous for being the Place which the Saxons landed at, when they fir&s;t came into Britain; the fir&s;t Livery and Sei&s;in which they had of the whole Kingdom, conferred by the improvident Bounty of Vortiger, to who&s;e
<PB N="120" REF="80">Aid they were called in. And no le&s;s remar|kable for being the Landing Place of Augu|&s;tine the Monk, when he brought the Go&s;pel to the victorious Heathen Saxons, and by his Preaching &s;ubjected them to the Rules of Chri|&s;tianity.</P>
<P>At <HI>Stonar,</HI> a Port Town of this I&s;land, is the Sepulchre (&s;ays <HI>Heylin</HI>) of <HI>Vortimer,</HI> King of the Britains. Who, having vanqui&s;hed the Saxons in many Battels, and finally driven them out of the I&s;land, de&s;ired to be here interred, on a fond conceit that his dead Corps would fright them from Landing any more upon the&s;e Goa&s;ts. Which he did probably in imi|tation of that <HI>Scipio,</HI> who having had a for|tunate Hand again&s;t tho&s;e of Carthage, gave order that his Tomb &s;hould be turned towards Africk, to fright the Carthaginians from the Coa&s;ts of Italy. But the Britains found at la&s;t by &s;ad experience, the difference there is be|twixt a King in the Field and a King in the Grave.</P>
<P>On the North Shore of this I&s;land is a Point of Land, of &s;pecial note among Mariners, by the Name of <HI>North Foreland.</HI> And the whole I&s;le in general is noted for giving the Title of Earl to the Right Honourable <HI>Thomas Tuf|ton,</HI> the pre&s;ent Earl of Thanet.</P>
<P><HI>Shepey</HI> is another I&s;land, much about the bigne&s;s of the former. Surrounded on all &s;ides with the Sea, except Southward, where it is parted by the Medway from the main Land of Kent. This is likewi&s;e a very fruitful I|&s;land, winch from the great Flocks of Sheep that feed here, came perhaps to be called <HI>She|pey.</HI> 'Tis well watered with Rivers, e&s;pe|cially the South Parts of it. And the Soil of it has a peculiar quality, in not breeding
<PB N="121" REF="80">of Moles. This I&s;land has been much hara&s;|&s;ed by the Danes, and by the Followers of Earl Goodwin and his Sons. At pre&s;ent it gives the Title of Counte&s;s to the Lady Eli|zabeth, Counte&s;s of Shepey, Lady Dacres, &amp;c. The chief Place is <HI>Queenborough,</HI> which &s;tands on the We&s;t Coa&s;t. Be&s;ides which here are &s;e|veral other Towns, as <HI>Minster, Ea&s;t-Church, Warden, Ley&s;den, Elmley,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>We&s;t from this I&s;land is another of a &s;mall Compa&s;s, on which &s;tands the Fort called <HI>Sheerne&s;s,</HI> which commands the Mouth of the Thames and Medway.</P>
<P>To conclude, as to the County of <HI>Kent,</HI> it &s;tands now divided between the Dioce&s;e of Canterbury and Roche&s;ter, and was (as I &s;aid before) a Kingdom of it &s;elf in the Time of the Heptarchy. Called <HI>Cantium</HI> and the Inha|bitants <HI>Cantii,</HI> by the Romans.</P>
<P>Out of it are elected, be&s;ides the two Knights of the Shire, 16 Members of Parliament. Viz.

<P>It has been for &s;everal Ages dignify'd with the Title of an Earldom, that is, ever &s;ince the Entrance of the Normans, but not without &s;eve|ral Interruptions.

<PB N="123" REF="83">but &s;mall, in &s;o large a quantity of Ground; but that there are many Chappels of Ea&s;e, equal to Pari&s;hes el&s;ewhere for Multitudes of People.</P>
<P>Here the <HI>Air</HI> is &s;harp, thin, and piercing, &s;eldom troubled with Fogs. And the Inhabi|tants accordingly are healthfull, comely, &s;trong, and long-lived, not &s;ubject to many Di&s;ea|&s;es.</P>
<P>The <HI>Soil</HI> differs much, according to its dif|ferent nature and &s;ituation; &s;ome Parts being Mountainous, and of the Champain Country &s;ome very fruitfull, &s;ome Mo&s;&s;y, and the re&s;t Moori&s;h.</P>
<P>The Champain Country is very good for Wheat and Barley; but that which lies at the bottom of the Hills is be&s;t for Oats.</P>
<P>From the Mo&s;&s;es, which are not unlike the Iri&s;h Bogs, &s;ome of them many Miles in Com|pa&s;s, the common People get Turves for their Firing. And &s;ometimes they dig up Trees out of them, which &s;erve both for Building and Fewel. Cambden &s;eems to be of Opinion, that they are &s;ubterraneous Trees growing un|der Ground, as &s;ome other Plants do.</P>
<P>The Mountainous Part, which lies Ea&s;t|ward, is full of &s;tony, craggy, and barren Hills, bare of Wood, and the Habitation of Foxes, Conies, Otters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Among&s;t the&s;e Hills, &s;ome are of a prodigious height; e&s;pe|cially <HI>Pendle-Hill,</HI> on the top whereof grow's a peculiar Plant called <HI>Cloudsberry,</HI> as coming from the Clouds. But one thing be&s;ides is remarkable in this Hill, that, whenever the Top of it is covered with a Mi&s;t, 'tis an in|fallible Sign of Rain.</P>
<PB N="124" REF="84">
<P>The Country in general is well watered with <HI>Rivers;</HI> the chief whereof are the <HI>Mer|&s;ey,</HI> the <HI>Rible,</HI> and the <HI>Lon,</HI> all three running from Ea&s;t to We&s;t into the Iri&s;h Sea. The <HI>Mer&s;ey</HI> Waters the South Parts, and &s;erves for a Boundary betwixt this County and Che|&s;hire; the <HI>Rible</HI> waters the middle; and the <HI>Lon,</HI> the North Parts.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e Rivers, and many others of le&s;s note, here are &s;everal great <HI>Meers</HI> (or <HI>Lakes,</HI>) as <HI>Merton,</HI> and <HI>Winder</HI> (or <HI>Wimander</HI>) Meer. This la&s;t divides part of <HI>Lanca&s;hire</HI> from <HI>We&s;t|morland,</HI> reaching about 10 miles in length, and 3 or 4 in breadth. It has (as mo&s;t Lakes in the North) a clear pebbly Bottom, whence the Saying, that this Lake is all paved with Stone. And it breeds great &s;tore of Fi&s;h, particularly Trouts, Pikes, Pearches, Eels, and Skellies. But there's one &s;ort of Fi&s;h peculiar to it, and not to be found el&s;e|where, except in <HI>Vlles Water,</HI> another Lake, bordering both upon Cumberland and We&s;t|morland. <HI>Charre</HI> is the Name of it, and 'tis a dainty Fi&s;h, whereof many Pies are yearly &s;ent abroad for Pre&s;ents.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, tho' this Country in general cannot be called a fruitfull Country, yet what is good of it yields abundance of good Gra&s;s and Corn, the faire&s;t Oxen in England, and in general all &s;orts of Provi&s;ions. Fi&s;h and Fowl particularly here's great plenty of; and in the River Lon, near Cockerfand Abbey, is great &s;tore of Salmon.</P>

The Ru|ins of its &s;tately Buildings, Palaces, Temples, Theaters, together with the Water-pipes, Vaults, Hot-Hou&s;es, Altars, and Roman Coyns, often digged up here, do &s;ufficiently evidence its former Antiquity and Greatne&s;s. Here King Arthur kept his Court; and in this City was a famous School or Colledge, to learn A&s;tronomy, and other Arts. As for its pre|&s;ent State, the Town is pretty large, and the Hou&s;es for the generality built of Stone. It has yet the Ruins of a Ca&s;tle &s;tanding.</P>

<P>The <HI>Yare,</HI> particularly noted for its great plenty of a certain Fi&s;h called <HI>Ruff,</HI> who&s;e body is all Prickled over; the tail and fins &s;potted with black Specks.

A Town of good antiquity, large, and well built, containing 3 Pari&s;h-Churches; and for its Defence, incompa&s;&s;ed with a Wall, and a good Ditch. Well Inhabited by Mer|chants and Trade&s;men, who drive a con&s;ide|rable Trade, and the more by rea&s;on of its commodious Haven. Yet it is much eclip&s;ed in its Trade, to what it was formerly, be|cau&s;e of the &s;toppage of a Sluce upon the Ou&s;e, which do's &s;o ob&s;truct the Current of &s;alt Water, that the River is &s;carce navigable to Cambridge.</P>
<P>Nigh unto this Town, on the other &s;ide of the Ou&s;e, is a little Mar&s;h Country, called <HI>Mar&s;h-Land,</HI> very &s;ubject to the Inundations of the Sea, and therefore very moi&s;t and agui&s;h.

Of &s;pecial note be&s;ides, for Herring|fi&s;hing, in the Seas adjacent, in the Month of September.

<P><HI>Thetford</HI> is an Inland Town, &s;ituate on the Confluence of the Thet and the little Ou&s;e, over wich it has a Bridge leading to Suffolk. A Place of great Antiquity, built out of the Ruins of the ancient City <HI>Sitomagus,</HI> which was de&s;troyed by the mercile&s;s Danes. The Bi|&s;hop's See of the Ea&s;t Angles was from North-Elmham removed hither, and from hence to Norwich. It is not very well Inhabited, to what it has been.

<P>Not far from Hickling, in the North-Ea&s;t Parts, is the ancient decay'd <HI>Abbey of St. Bennet's in the Holme,</HI> built by the Dani&s;h King Ca|nute. An Abbey &s;o fortified afterwards by its Monks with Walls and Bulwarks, that it &s;eemed rather a Ca&s;tle than a Cloy&s;ter; and yet was betrayed by a Monk to William the Conqueror. The Bi&s;hop of Norwich re|tains to this Day the Title of Lord Abbot of St. Bennets. And it is ob&s;ervable, that hereabouts both Cockles and Perwinkles are digged out of the Ground.</P>

<P>La&s;tly, this County (which is the large&s;t in England next to York&s;hire, but much more populous) was Part of the Kingdom of the Ea&s;t-Angles, in the time of the Heptarchy; and its Inhabitants, part of the <HI>Iceni,</HI> as the Romans called them.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;erved of the People in this Coun|ty, that they are notably indu&s;trious for Plough and Manufactures, in&s;omuch that one &s;hall hardly &s;ee a Beggar throughout all the Coun|try. And yet (which one would wonder at) they are notable Wranglers, and generally &s;o well ver&s;ed in the Quirks of the Law, that they create more work for the A&s;&s;izes than almo&s;t all the Circuit el&s;e. Accordingly Nor|folk is the County, which commonly yields the be&s;t Breed of Lawyers, and has furni&s;hed the Courts of Ju&s;tice with many an emiment Man in the Laws of England. But a great Antiquary has made another material Ob&s;er|vation, That in this County are a hundred Families of ancient Gentry, that never were attainted of high Trea&s;on. Which if it be true, the Gentry here have had better fortune than the Dukes, Dutche&s;&s;es, and Earls of Nor|folk.</P>

<HEAD>Northum|berland,</HEAD>
<P><HI>NORTH&V;MBERLAND,</HI> a Mari|time County, and the furthe&s;t North in England, is bounded <HI>on the Ea&s;t</HI> by the German Ocean; <HI>on the We&s;t,</HI> by Cumber|land, and the Cheviot Hills which part it from Scotland; <HI>Northward,</HI> by the River <HI>Twede,</HI> which divides it al&s;o from Scotland; and <HI>Southward,</HI> by the Bi&s;hoprick of Durham, from which &s;evered in part by the River <HI>Tine.</HI></P>
<P>Its <HI>Form</HI> is triangular, contains in <HI>Length</HI> from North to South about 40 long Miles, and in <HI>Breadth</HI> from Ea&s;t to We&s;t (at the broade&s;t) 30. The Whole divided into &s;ix <HI>Wards,</HI> wherein 460 <HI>Pari&s;hes,</HI> and but 6 <HI>Mar|ket-Towns.</HI></P>
<PB N="164" REF="104">
<P>The <HI>Air</HI> of this County is &s;harp and piercing in Winter, and &s;ometimes troubled with deep Snows and pinching Fro&s;ts, &s;utable to its Cli|mate. But yet 'tis nothing near &s;o &s;harp as the People. And by my late Experi|ence, here wet Weather is not &s;o &s;en&s;ible and &s;earching, as it is in Middle&s;ex. 'Tis po&s;&s;ible the warm Breaths that continually come out of its numberle&s;s Colepits helps, with the Vapours of the Sea, to take off the rawne&s;s of a cold dampi&s;h Air.</P>
<P>For the <HI>Soil,</HI> as this County is nearly re|lated to Scotland, &s;o it is one of the wor&s;t Counties in England; being for the mo&s;t part rough and hilly, and hard to be manured. Yet in &s;ome Parts, chiefly towards the Sea, it is fertile enough. But the greate&s;t Ri|ches of this Country lies in the Bowels of the Earth, full of Coal-mines. Which &s;upply with Coals, not only this Country (where that Fewel is always bought at very ea&s;y rates) but a good Part of England be|&s;ides; and London particularly, for who&s;e U&s;e many hundred Sail of Ships have yearly from hence their Loading.</P>
<P>The Coal-Pits, made u&s;e of to get up this Trea&s;ure, are all &s;quare, commonly 7 or 8 foot in diameter, and timbered from top to bottom; &s;ome 30, &s;ome 40, more or le&s;s, but few above 50 fadoms deep. A great Depth for Workmen, to go and rake a Livelyhood. And yet here is a Legion of &s;uch Men, bred and born to it, that &s;pend mo&s;t of their Life in this Land of Darkne&s;s; in continual Danger (be&s;ides that of the Rope) of being cru&s;hed below by a <HI>Thru&s;t,</HI> &s;ometimes in Danger of Water, and in &s;ome places of Fire.</P>
<PB N="165" REF="104">
<P>The Way to go down the&s;e Pits, and to come up, is by the help of a Rope; one end whereof being made into a Loop, the Work|man gets a Leg and Knee into it, as far as the very Hip. Thus hugging the Rope with one Arm, his Life wrapt up with it, down he goes, while the Rope turns about an En|gine made for that purpo&s;e. If the Rope fails, as &s;ometimes it does through Carele&s;|ne&s;s, there's an end of the Man and of the Conveyance.</P>
<P>By a <HI>Thru&s;t</HI> is meant the fall of &s;ome Earth, or great Stones, whereby 'tis the ill fate of &s;ome to be cru&s;hed; as it is of others to be drowned by a &s;udden Irruption of Waters, from an old Wa&s;te, or otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>But &s;ome Pits at Sunderland, in the Bi&s;hop|rick of Durham, are &s;ubject be&s;ides to <HI>Fire-Damps.</HI> So they call an Inflammation of the Air in tho&s;e &s;ubterraneous Parts, which be|ing more than ordinary affected with &s;ulphu|rous matter, are &s;ometimes apt to catch fire, and then all go's to wrack. It breaks out like a Thunder-bolt, carries all away with it higher than the Pits Mouth, and that with a di&s;mal noi&s;e, as it were with a crack of Thun|der. In this Ca&s;e one might compare the inflamed Sulphur to Gun-powder, the Coal|pit to a great Gun, and what it brings up with it to Bullets, it comes up with &s;uch a force. But, when this happens, the Work|men fore&s;ee it, by their Candles burning blue and blazing more than ordinary. Where|upon they lay them&s;elves flat upon the Ground, and let the Meteor work it &s;elf a|bove it.</P>

<P>This Town is &s;eated on the North-Bank of the River <HI>Tine,</HI> about 7 miles from its fall into the Sea. Over the River it has a fair Stone-Bridge leading to Gate&s;head in the Bi|&s;hoprick of Durham, with an Iron-Gate upon it, which parts the two Counties. It &s;tands high and low, part upon a &s;teep Hill, and part in the bottom on't near the River. The Streets upon the A&s;cent are &s;o very &s;teep, that they &s;tand like &s;o many Ladders. And yet both Men and Hor&s;es are &s;o u&s;ed to 'em, that they make little of it, either with or without a Load. The Hou&s;es are mo&s;t of Stone, &s;ome Timber, and a few Brick-hou&s;es. In &s;hort, it is a Place of that extent as to contain four large Pari&s;hes, with as many Churches. The Whole incompa&s;&s;ed with a Wall, and fortified with a Ca&s;tle, but neg|lected, and going to ruin.

<PB N="169" REF="106">by no le&s;s than 14 or 15 Arches. But as it &s;tands on the North &s;ide of the River, by the Bounds of Northumberland, it ought rather to be counted in Scotland than En|gland. And, becau&s;e it has been in the hands of the Engli&s;h from the Reign of Edward IV, therefore in all Acts of Parliament, and Royal Proclamations, wherein this Town is con|cerned, <HI>Barwick upon Twede</HI> is always named by it &s;elf, as a di&s;tinct Part of this Realm, and of Northumberland by con&s;equence. How|ever, as it is &s;o near a Neighbour to this County, I am unwilling to deviate from the Method of all Geographers, who&s;e way is to bring it under this Head, as if it were a part of Northumberland.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, <HI>Barwick,</HI> by its Situation, is a Place of good Strength, being almo&s;t &s;urrounded with Water, what with the Sea, and what with the River. But it is fortified be&s;ides with good Walls and a Ca&s;tle, be&s;ides other Forti|fications. The Occa&s;ion of it was its being a Frontire-Town, &s;ometimes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Scots, and &s;ometimes by the Engli&s;h, before the&s;e two Nations came to be united under one Head. So that, upon the lea&s;t Rupture, this Town was &s;ure to undergo the fir&s;t brunts of the War. It is large and populous, and the Hou&s;es well built; injoying a good Trade, e&s;pecially for Corn and Salmon. Here one may have a good Salmon for 12 pence.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, <HI>Barwick</HI> is, like Newca&s;tel, a Coun|ty of it &s;elf.

<P><HI>Holy I&s;land,</HI> the bigge&s;t of the three, and yet of no great extent, is not far from Bar|wick. This I&s;land, being in &s;hape not un|like a Wedge, runs out with a Neck of Land towards Northumberland.

The Memory whereof has continued for &s;everal Ages in the Cu&s;tom u&s;ed here of making a Dragon yearly, and carrying it about the Town in great Jollity on Mid&s;ummer Eve, with the addition of a Giant to it. At pre|&s;ent <HI>Burford</HI> is a famons Place for Saddles; and &s;omething advantaged be&s;ides by the neigh|bouring Downs, much re&s;orted unto by the Gentry for Hor&s;e races.

<P><HI>SOMERSETSHIRE,</HI> a large Ma|ritime County in the We&s;t of England, is &s;o called from <HI>Somerton,</HI> once the mo&s;t famous and mo&s;t con&s;iderable Town in all the County, and now but a &s;mall Market-Town of little or no credit.</P>
<P>'Tis bounded <HI>on the Ea&s;t</HI> by Wilt&s;hire and part of Devon&s;hire; <HI>on the West,</HI> by Devon|&s;hire; <HI>Northward,</HI> by the Severn Sea, and part of Gloce&s;ter&s;hire; <HI>Southward,</HI> by the Coun|ties of Devon and Dor&s;et.</P>
<P>Its <HI>Length,</HI> from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, is about 55 miles; its <HI>Breadth,</HI> from North to South, 40. The Whole divided into 42 <HI>Hun|dreds,</HI> wherein 385 <HI>Pari&s;hes,</HI> and 30 <HI>Market-Towns.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Air</HI> of this County, in the Summer Sea&s;on, is very agreeable; but, in Winter|time, 'tis apt to be too moi&s;t and foggy.</P>
<P>Accordingly the <HI>Soil</HI> in Winter is wet, miry, and moori&s;h, e&s;pecially in the mid&s;t of the Country, which makes the Roads very unea&s;y to Travellers. But in Summer there is no plea&s;anter Country, being garni&s;hed (as it is) with rich Pa&s;tures and delight|ful Meadows. Which has given occa&s;ion to an u&s;ual Proverb here, that <HI>what is wor&s;e for the Rider is be&s;t for the Abider.</HI></P>
<P>And, be&s;ides Corn and Cattle, wherewith this Country is plentifully &s;tored, here are in|&s;ome Parts, e&s;pecially towards Wilt&s;hire, rich Lead-Mines, to the great benefit not only of the County, but of the whole Kingdom. The&s;e Mines are found particularly in the Hills called <HI>Mendip-Hills;</HI> of no &s;mall Profit to the Owners.</P>
<P>As for its Diamonds, commonly called Bri|&s;tol-Stones,
<PB N="189" REF="116">I refer you to Bri&s;tol in Glo|ce&s;ter&s;hire.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the <HI>Severns</HI> Mouth, whereby the North-We&s;t Part of this Country is water|ed, here is the <HI>Avon,</HI> which parts this Coun|ty from Gloce&s;ter&s;hire, the <HI>Parret,</HI> the <HI>Tor, Tone, Frome,</HI> and others, well &s;tored with ex|cellent Fi&s;h.</P>
<P>In this County are three Cities, <HI>Bri&s;tol, Bath,</HI> and <HI>Wells. Bri&s;tol</HI> indeed &s;tands al&s;o in Glo|ce&s;ter&s;hire; and, as I have already de&s;cribed it there, I &s;hall pa&s;s it over here.</P>
<P><HI>Bath</HI> bears We&s;t and by South from Lon|don, and is di&s;tant therefrom 94 miles. Viz. from London to <HI>Reading,</HI> 32 miles, as you may &s;ee in Park&s;hire; from thence to <HI>Newbery,</HI> 15; and to <HI>Marlborough,</HI> 15 more; thence to <HI>Chipenham,</HI> 15; and to <HI>Bath</HI> 13 more.</P>
<P>It is &s;o called from its Medicinal hot Baths, much re&s;orted unto from all Parts, as being found by long experience to be of great virtue in the curing of Aches and other Di|&s;tempers.</P>
<P>Its Situation is on the River <HI>Avon,</HI> over which it has a Stone-Bridge; and there it lies in a low and &s;mall Plain, &s;urrounded with Hills very high and &s;teep, out of which i&s;&s;ue forth &s;everal Springs of Water, which pay Tribute to it. This is a Place of great Antiquity, as does appear by many Roman In&s;criptions and Images commonly found in the Walls which incompa&s;s it. And where the Abbey now &s;tands, 'tis &s;aid there was of old a Temple con&s;ecrated to Minerva, the Godde&s;s of Fountains and Baths. In &s;hort, 'tis a fine City, graced with well|built Hou&s;es; and for divine Wor&s;hip, hav|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> a Pari&s;h Church, be&s;ides its Cathe|dral.</P>

<P>The Baths in it are four in number, viz. the <HI>Cro&s;s,</HI> and the <HI>hot Bath,</HI> in the We&s;t Parts of the City, the <HI>King's</HI> and the <HI>Queen's-Bath,</HI> in the middle.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cro&s;s Bath,</HI> &s;o called from a Cro&s;s that formerly &s;tood in the mid&s;t of it, is Triangular, about 25 foot long, and as broad at one end. This is of a more gentle heat than the re&s;t, becau&s;e it has fewer Springs. About 100 foot from it is the <HI>Hot-Bath,</HI> &s;o called, becau&s;e formerly it was much hotter than the re&s;t, when it was not &s;o large as now it is.</P>
<P>The <HI>King's Bath</HI> is about 60 foot &s;quare, and has about the middle of it many hot Springs ri&s;ing, whence it has the greater heat. The <HI>Queen's Bath</HI> has no Spring in it, but on|ly receives the Water from the King's Bath, from which it is only divided by a Wall; and &s;o it is more temperate than the King's. In the&s;e two Baths is a Pump, to pump Water upon the Di&s;ea&s;ed, where &s;trong Embrocati|ons are required.</P>
<P>In every one of the <HI>Baths</HI> are Seats of Stone, for the conveniency of tho&s;e that u&s;e 'em. But from 8 a Clock in the morning till about 3 in the afternoon, the&s;e Baths are &s;hut up, and none permitted entrance; being then &s;o very hot, that they work and ca&s;t up a filth from the bottom.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of <HI>Bath</HI> do not only find a great advantage by the&s;e Medicinal Springs, but al&s;o by their Cloth Manufacture, wherein they drive a con&s;iderable Trade. And, for Provi&s;ions, they have two Markets a Week, viz. Wedne&s;days and Satur|days.</P>
<PB N="191" REF="117">
<P>This City is Partner with <HI>Wells,</HI> the Bi|&s;hops See, in the Title Epi&s;copal.</P>
<P>Noted be&s;ides, for giving the Title of Earl to the Right Honourable <HI>John Granvile,</HI> creat|ed Earl of Bath by King Charles the II. Anno 1661. Which Title was formerly in|joy'd by the Heirs of <HI>John Bourchier,</HI> who was created Earl of Bath by King Henry VIII.

<P><HI>Langport</HI> &s;tands on the top of a Hill, in a miry and moori&s;h Country, and near the River <HI>Parret,</HI> which next to the Avon is the mo&s;t con&s;iderable.</P>

The fir&s;t is a large, well-inhabited, and frequented Town, adorned with the Title of an Earldom, in the per&s;on of the Right Ho|nourable <HI>John Egerton,</HI> the pre&s;ent Earl of Bridgewater.

But he dying with|out I&s;&s;ue, this Title died with him; till re|vived, as afore&s;aid.</P>
<P><HI>Gla&s;&s;enbury,</HI> of old called the I&s;land of <HI>Avalon,</HI> is of chief note for its once famous and &s;tate|ly Abbey; the Monks whereof (for the Cre|dit of it) gave it out, that the Body of <HI>Jo|&s;eph of Arimathea</HI> lay there Interred. Cer|tain it is, that this was a Shelter to the Britains in the latter Times of the Briti&s;h Churches, when they were mi&s;erably hara&s;&s;ed and per&s;ecuted by the Pagan Saxons And it might be (as Dr. <HI>Stillingfleet</HI> &s;ays) of far greater reque&s;t among the Britains, becau&s;e it was the Place where King <HI>Arthur</HI> was bu|ried. Who&s;e Body was found there very deep in the Earth in the Reign of Henry II, with a Latine In&s;cription on a leaden Cro&s;s, ex|pre&s;&s;ing

<P><HI>Axebridge</HI> is &s;o called from the River Axe, on which it is &s;ituate, <HI>Pensford</HI> and <HI>Cane&s;ham</HI> ly North and by Ea&s;t from Axebridge; both &s;eated on the Chire, and the la&s;t at its very fall into the Avon, near Bri&s;tol. <HI>Philip-Nor|ton</HI> and <HI>Froum&s;elwood</HI> &s;tand near the Froume, on the Confines of Wilt&s;hire. <HI>Shepton-Malles</HI> and <HI>Somerton</HI> ly South and by We&s;t from 'em; both pretty large, but poor Towns.

<P><HI>Ilche&s;ter,</HI> &s;o called from the River <HI>Ill,</HI> or <HI>Yeovel,</HI> upon which it is &s;eated, is a Town of great Antiquity, and was once a Place of good Strength.

<P>But, to conclude, this County in general is noted for two Things, be&s;ides the fore-men|tioned.

But, upon the Re&s;tauration of King Charles the Second, the Title was re&s;tored to the Line in the per&s;on of <HI>William Seymour,</HI> the great Grandchild of the fore&s;aid Duke; from whom it is now devolved to the pre&s;ent Duke, Bro|ther to <HI>Francis</HI> who was killed in Italy.</P>
<P>'Tis remarkable be&s;ides, that this County was few Years &s;ince the Scene which brought the late Duke of Monmouth, with many of his Followers, to their tragical End; and gave an Opportunity to the Popi&s;h Party, by the uncontroulable Authority of the late King James, to hurry on their De&s;ign of Intailing Popery and Slavery upon the&s;e Nations. Which was wonderfully defeated, under God, by the Magnanimity of our pre&s;ent King.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, this County (which formerly was Part of the Kingdom of the <HI>We&s;t-Saxons,</HI> and its Inhabitants Part of the <HI>Belgae</HI> in the Time of the Romans) is now in the Dioce&s;e of <HI>Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h</HI> and <HI>Wells.</HI></P>

Plea|&s;ure, for they afford the greate&s;t plenty of

And &s;o great was formerly the Number of Parks and Warrens in this Shire, that there was &s;carce any Gentlemans Seat in the Coun|ty but what had both Park and Warrens.

<P>In &s;hort, the North Part of this Country is full of Hills, and Woods, the South &s;tored with Coals and Mines of Iron, and the middle Part (being watered with the River Trent) adorned with fair Corn-fields and Meadows. And yet in the North-Parts the Pa&s;tures near the River Dove yield the &s;weete&s;t and fatte&s;t Mutton in England.</P>
<P>For Manuring the Ground, here's plenty both of Lime and Marl. For Building, a|bundance of Timber and Stone, which la&s;t for its finene&s;s and durablene&s;s is held in good e&s;teem.

In the South Part, which is the greater of the two, &s;tands a Grammar-School for the Education of Children, and an Ho&s;pi|tal dedicated to S. John, for the Relief of the Poor. In the other Parts there's nothing con&s;iderable but a fair Cathedral, and that &s;uf|ficient of it &s;elf to renoun the Place. Fir&s;t built by O&s;win, King of Northumberland, about the Year 656, who gave the Bi&s;hops hereof many Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. Afterwards being taken down by Roger de Clinton, the 37th Bi|&s;hop of this Dioce&s;e, that which now &s;tands was built by him, and dedicated to the Vir|gin Mary and S. Chad. Be&s;ides the Cathedral, this City has 3 Pari&s;h Churches. And its Weekly Markets, kept on Tue&s;days and Fri|days, are well &s;erved with Provi&s;ions.</P>

<P>As to the <HI>Soil,</HI> the Ea&s;tern Parts all along the Coa&s;t, for five or &s;ix miles Inland, are ge|nerally heathy, &s;andy, and full of blea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Hills; yet &s;uch as yield abundance of Rye Pea&s;e, and Hemp, and feed abundance o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Sheep.

But the Parts about Bury, and to the North-We&s;t from thence, are generally Champain, abounding with excellent Corn of all &s;orts. And as for Parks, here are reckoned in this County near upon fifty.</P>
<P>For <HI>Rivers,</HI> few Counties are &s;o well wa|tered. Be&s;ides the little <HI>Ou&s;e</HI> and the <HI>Wave|ney,</HI> which part it from Norfolk here is the <HI>Stoure,</HI> which &s;evers it from E&s;&s;ex, the <HI>Orwell</HI> or <HI>Gippe,</HI> the <HI>Ore, Blithe, Deben,</HI> and <HI>Breton,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<P>This is one of the be&s;t and mo&s;t thriving Towns in England, &s;eated in the South-Ea&s;t Parts of the County, on the Banks of the <HI>Orwell,</HI> about 20 miles from its fall into the Sea.

But, that Storm being over, it began in the Nor|mans Time to recover it &s;elf. So that at this pre&s;ent, whether we con&s;ider its Extent, Populou&s;ne&s;s, or Trade, it yields to very few Cities in England.

<P>Among which <HI>Bury,</HI> or <HI>S. Edmunds Bury,</HI> is the mo&s;t remarkable; being &s;o called from King <HI>Edmund</HI> the Martyr, here interred. Who, for not renouncing the Chri&s;tian Faith, was &s;hot to death at Hoxon by the Danes, and his Body &s;tuck by degrees with Arrows. In this Town was erected the fir&s;t Chri&s;tian Church by Sigebert, King of the Ea&s;t-Angles, in which King Edmund was buried. And, in Memory of him, here was erected a mo&s;t &s;tately Abbey, of which and the Town it &s;elf take this De&s;cription from an ancient Author. The Sun, &s;ays he, has not &s;een a Town more finely or delicately &s;eated, upon the Ea&s;t A&s;cent of a Hill, with a River running on the Ea&s;t &s;ide. Nor a more &s;tately Abbey, incom|parable either for Magnificence or Revenues, in who&s;e pro&s;pect appeareth rather a City than a Mona&s;tery. So many Gates it has for entrance, and many of them Bra&s;s; &s;o many Towers; and, above all, a mo&s;t glorious Chuch. Upon which attend three others, &s;tanding all in the &s;ame Church-yard, all of them very fine, and of curious Artifice. The Town, at pre&s;ent, do's con&s;i&s;t of two Pari&s;h-Churches; the Hou&s;es pretty well built; the Market-hill, Fair-&s;tead, and Corn-Cro&s;s, &s;pa|cious and hand&s;om. And for what remains of the Abbey it &s;elf (in who&s;e Yard &s;tands an old Shire-Hou&s;e) 'tis far more maje&s;tick, than any other Ruins of its kind. The Market is of &s;pecial note, for the extraordinary Quan|tities of Corn brought to it, for which 'tis u&s;ually the Standard of the Country. La&s;t|ly, not far from this Town was that great Battel fought again&s;t King Henry the Second, where this King had the good fortune to overthrow Robert Earl of Leice&s;ter, with his
<PB N="206" REF="126">Rabble of Flemings, who joyned with the rebellious Son of King Henry, the Earl him|&s;elf and his Wife being taken Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P><HI>Stow-Market</HI> and <HI>Needham</HI> are both &s;eated upon the Orwell. The fir&s;t, as it were, in the Center of the County, having a fair Pro|&s;pect down the River Ea&s;tward. 'Tis a large and beautifull Town, graced with a &s;pacious Church, and its Steeple adorned with a huge and lofty Pinnacle, not ea&s;y to be paral|lelled. The grand Trade of this Town is in Tammeys, and other Norwich Stuffs, this be|ing the only Town in Suffolk con&s;iderable for &s;uch Things.</P>
<P><HI>Needham,</HI> an ominous Name, drives &s;till a Trade (but le&s;s than formerly) in the Suf|folk blue and broad Cloths for Ru&s;&s;ia, Turky, and orher Countries. Which creates &s;pinning Work for the poorer &s;ort of Women, whil&s;t others get a Livelyhood by making of Bone|lace.</P>
<P><HI>Debenham,</HI> and <HI>Woodbridge,</HI> are on the River. Deben. The la&s;t a large Town, &s;eated on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of a &s;andy Hill, watered with &s;everal Streams, and having a plea&s;ant Pro|&s;pect down the River Deben, which about 12 miles lower di&s;charges it &s;elf into the Sea. Here is a fair Church, with &s;everal Monu|ments in it. In the mid&s;t of its Market-Place is al&s;o a fair Pile of brick, in a Chamber whereof are held the Quarter-Se&s;&s;ions for the Liberty of S. Ethelred and Audry. The Mar|ket well traded unto, e&s;pecially for Hemp. In this Town are four or five good Docks for building of Ships, mo&s;t of 'em well imploy'd, and noted among Seamen for good Work|man&s;hip. The Inhabitants, for their part, drive a con&s;iderable Trade by Sea, for which
<PB N="207" REF="126">they are furni&s;hed with &s;everal Ships of bur|den. And the principal Commodities they deal in are Butter, Chee&s;e, Pouldavis, Sack|cloth, Planks, &amp;c. be&s;ides their refining of Salt.</P>
<P><HI>Orford,</HI> a few miles Ea&s;t and by South from Woodbridge, is &s;eated between the River Ore on the Ea&s;t and a &s;maller Stream on the We&s;t, within two miles from the Sea. Here is a Church well mounted, but un&s;ightly with|in; and hard by it the Ruins of a high clo&s;e-built Ca&s;tle. Which, together with the Church-Steeple, are good Directions to Sea|men, as the Light-hou&s;e at the Ne&s;s is by night.</P>
<P>In the Reign of Henry the Second (&s;ay's Sir Richard Baker) there was taken near <HI>Or|ford</HI> a Fi&s;h in the Shape of a Man, which was kept in the Ca&s;tle above 6 months. This Fi&s;h eat all manner of Meat, but delighted chiefly in Fi&s;h. An Author that comments upon it &s;ays very &s;eriou&s;ly, that <HI>he &s;poke not one Word,</HI> and Rea&s;on good, for it was a Fi&s;h; and that <HI>the People brought him &s;ometimes to Church, but he never &s;hewed any Sign of Adoration,</HI> which is no wonder of a Fi&s;h. At length, for want of looking to, this Man-Fi&s;h &s;tole into the Sea, and was never more &s;een, <HI>becau&s;e</HI> (I gue&s;s) <HI>the Water was his Element.</HI></P>
<P>But here is &s;omething more admirable. On the narrow &s;tony Beach, that &s;hoots Southerly betwixt the Town and the Sea, 'tis &s;aid that in the Year 1555, when there was a great Dearth, there &s;prang up among the <HI>Meer|&s;hingle</HI> &s;uch Quantities of Pea&s;e, that the People gathered of 'em above 100 Quarters; which both abated the price of Corn, and pre&s;erved many from fami&s;hing. And at the
<PB N="208" REF="127">South Point of it, there &s;till comes up yearly certain cour&s;e gray Pea&s;e, and good Coleworts out of the Stone-heaps.</P>
<P><HI>Alborough,</HI> another Coa&s;t-Town, ly's 2 miles North-Ea&s;t of <HI>Orford.</HI> Plea&s;antly &s;eated in a Dale, between the Sea on the Ea&s;t, a high Hill on the We&s;t where &s;tands a large and old-built Church, and a &s;mall River that runs to the Southward. This is a long, large, and plain-built Town, with mean Hou&s;es. Chief|ly noted for its Fi&s;hery, for which they have a commodious Key at <HI>Slaughden,</HI> a quarter of a mile Southwards; and, along the Beach towards <HI>Orford,</HI> Conveniencies above other Towns, for the drying of their North-Sea-Fi&s;h. A little North of the Town is a Village, call|ed <HI>Thorp,</HI> whence &s;everal Parts of the County are &s;erved with Lob&s;ters and Crabs.</P>
<P><HI>Saxmund&s;ham</HI> lies North of Alborough, and at &s;ome di&s;tance from the Sea, upon a &s;mall River.</P>
<P><HI>Dunwich,</HI> on the Sea-&s;hore, was the fir&s;t Bi&s;hops See of the Ea&s;t-Angles, for the Coun|ty of Suffolk. Then a Town capable of that Dignity; now ruinous, decay'd, and for the greate&s;t part worn into the Sea. However it do's &s;till contain two Pari&s;h Churches. Fi&s;hing of Sprats in Winter, and of Herrings, Mackerels, Soles, and the like, in their pro|per Sea&s;ons, is the chief Imployment of its Inhabitants, as it is with tho&s;e of Albo|rough.</P>
<P><HI>Swold,</HI> or <HI>Sowold,</HI> a few miles more North|ward, &s;tands al&s;o by the Sea-&s;ide. Seated on a plea&s;ant Cliff, the Sea on the Ea&s;t, the Har|bour on the South, the River Blithe with a Draw-bridge on the We&s;t, and a &s;mall Neck of Land on the North. So that it is almo&s;t
<PB N="209" REF="127">incompa&s;&s;ed with Water, e&s;pecially at every floud. And, be&s;ides the natural Situation of the Place, which renders it a Town of good &s;trength, here are planted on the Cliff &s;eve|ral Pieces of Ordnance. Its Bay called <HI>Swolds Bay,</HI> &s;o famous for Ships to ride in, is chiefly made by the Shooting forth of <HI>Ea&s;ton Ne&s;s,</HI> a little North of it, which is the mo&s;t Ea&s;tern Part of all England.</P>
<P><HI>Le&s;toft</HI> is the mo&s;t Northern Sea-Town of this County, and a good thriving Place. Its chief Trade con&s;i&s;ts in fi&s;hing for Cod in the North Sea, and at home for Herrings, for which it lies mo&s;t conveniently over again&s;t the chief Herring-Beds.</P>
<P><HI>Beckles</HI> and <HI>Bungay</HI> are both &s;eated on the banks of the Waveney. The fir&s;t has two Pari&s;h-Churches; and a Grammar-School, with ten Scholar&s;hips for Emanuel Colledge in Cambridge. Here the Womens Imploy is to knit Wor&s;ted Stockings, whil&s;t at Di&s;s in Norfolk on the other &s;ide of the River they imploy them&s;elves in knitting of Silk ones.</P>
<P><HI>Hale&s;worth, Framlingham,</HI> and <HI>Eye,</HI> make a kind of Triangle. The fir&s;t is a thriving Town for Retail Trade, dealing much in Linnen, Yarn and Sale Cloth.</P>
<P><HI>Framlingham,</HI> a good large Town, is &s;eated upon a Clay-hill, near the head of the River Ore. Defended by a &s;pacious tall Ca&s;tle of Saxon Work, well walled, and double ditched on one part, with a large Meer on the other part. This Ca&s;tle had once no le&s;s than 13 high Towers; and was counted &s;o &s;trong, that Robert, the rebellious Earl of Leice&s;ter again&s;t King Henry the Second, took up his Quarters here. Its Inworks are now
<PB N="210" REF="128">much defaced, there being only a large Dwelling-hou&s;e, a Grammar-School-Hou&s;e, &amp;c; but the Outworks are more like a Ca&s;tle, than the Ruins of one.</P>
<P><HI>Eye,</HI> a pretty large Market-Town, and an ancient Corporation, is &s;ituate in a watery Place. It &s;hew's a fair Church, with the Ruins of a Ca&s;tle, and of an ancient Bene|dictine Abbey called S. Peter's. The Wo|mens Imploy in this Town is making of Bone|lace. This Corporation is a Peculiar of the Crown, an Honour of ancient Time, and has been given in Joynture with the Queens of England.</P>
<P><HI>Budde&s;dale,</HI> &s;ome miles We&s;t of Eye, is but a little Borough-Town, &s;eated (according to its Name) in a Dale. Here is a Grammar-School indowed, with certain Scholar&s;hips a&s;|&s;igned to Bennet (or Corpus Chri&s;ti Colledge) in Cambridge.</P>
<P><HI>Hadleigh</HI> and <HI>Lavenham</HI> are both &s;eated on the River Breton, and <HI>Bil&s;ton</HI> on a Rivulet that falls into it. The fir&s;t a Town of great ac|count formerly for its Clothing, has a fine Church, which is a great Ornament to it, and is a Peculiar of Canterbury. Of &s;ome note for the Martyrdom of Dr. Taylor, their &s;ome|time famous Mini&s;ter, who &s;uffered here for his Religion.</P>
<P>But, whereas <HI>Hadleigh</HI> is &s;eated in a Bot|tom, <HI>Lavenham</HI> on the contrary &s;tands on an Eminence. This al&s;o has a comely and &s;pacious Church and Steeple, injoy's a pretty good Trade, and is &s;omething the more fre|quented for its famous Lecture.</P>
<P><HI>Bil&s;ton,</HI> or <HI>Bilde&s;ton,</HI> is noted for its Blues and Blankets. And the Women here either &s;pin corded Wool for the Clothier, or white Work for the Packer.</P>
<PB N="211" REF="128">
<P><HI>Neyland, Sudbury, Clare,</HI> and <HI>Haverill,</HI> are all four &s;eated on the River Stower. The fir&s;t, in a rich Bottom, is a good Country Town, noted for its Clothing, but chiefly for its Bays and Sayes, wherein the Inhabitants drive a Trade with London.</P>
<P><HI>Sudbury</HI> is a good large Town, having a fair Bridge over the River Stower, which leads in|to E&s;&s;ex. It contains 3 Pari&s;h Churches, and drives a good Trade of Cloathing; being chiefly noted for Says, as Colche&s;ter in E&s;&s;ex for Bays. Of &s;ome Note be&s;ides, for giving the Title of Baron to his Grace the Duke of <HI>Grafton.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Clare</HI> is a Town of more antiquity than beauty, having nothing to boa&s;t of but the Ruins of a Ca&s;tle and Collegiate Church, but that it gave both Name and Title to that noble Family &s;urnamed <HI>De Clare,</HI> who in their Times were Earls of <HI>Hartford, Clare,</HI> and <HI>Glo|ce&s;ter.</HI> The la&s;t of that Name was <HI>Gilbert de Clare,</HI> who died Anno 1295. He had a Si&s;ter and Coheir, <HI>Elizabeth</HI> by Name, the Wife of <HI>William de Burg,</HI> Earl of Ul&s;ter in Ireland, by whom &s;he got a Daughter, their &s;ole Heir. To this great Heire&s;s <HI>Lionel,</HI> the third Son of King Edward III, was married, and upon his Marriage made Duke of <HI>Clarence,</HI> the Termi|nation of the Title being only changed, not the Place denominating.

<P><HI>Southwark,</HI> commonly pronounced <HI>Suthrick,</HI> &s;tands oppo&s;ite to the City of London on the Banks of the Thames. A Place which, for number of Buildings and Inhabitants, goes beyond mo&s;t of the Cities in England. But,

And here the Inhabitants drive a con&s;iderable Trade with the whole County, this being the mo&s;t convenient Place for the <HI>Surrey</HI> Carriers that come up; for who&s;e Accommodation here is Multitude of Inns.

<HEAD>Warwick|&s;hire.</HEAD>
<P><HI>WARWICKSHIRE,</HI> an Inland County, is bounded on the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> by the Counties of Leice&s;ter and Northampton; on the <HI>We&s;t,</HI> by Worce&s;ter&s;hire; on the <HI>North,</HI> by Stafford&s;hire; on the <HI>South,</HI> by the Counties of Oxford, Gloce&s;ter, and Worce&s;ter.</P>
<P>Its <HI>Length,</HI> from North to South, is &s;ome|thing le&s;s than 40 miles; its <HI>Breadth,</HI> from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, about 30. The Whole divided into &s;ive <HI>Hundreds,</HI> wherein 158 <HI>Pari&s;hes,</HI> and 15 <HI>Market-Towns.</HI></P>
<P>Here both the <HI>Air</HI> is whol&s;om, and the <HI>Soil</HI> rich, e&s;pecially the South Parts of it, called <HI>Feldon.</HI> Which affords rich Meadows, feeds &s;tore of Sheep and Cattle, and is exceeding grateful to the Hu&s;bandman in its Crops of Corn. The North Parts, formerly called <HI>Arden,</HI> and &s;ince <HI>Woodland,</HI> from its great plenty of Woods (though at this time much wa&s;ted by rea&s;on of its Iron Mines) are not altogether &s;o|fruitful as the Southern Parts.</P>
<PB N="231" REF="138">
<P>It is generally well watered with fre&s;h Streams; the principal of which is the <HI>Avon,</HI> which with many windings and turnings runneth through the Country, and falls at la&s;t into the Severn.</P>
<P><HI>Warwick,</HI> the Shire-Town, from whence the County took its Name, bears from London North-We&s;t, and is di&s;tant therefrom 70 miles, thus. From London to <HI>Buckingham</HI> 44 miles, as you may &s;ee in Buckingham|&s;hire; from thence to <HI>Banbury,</HI> 10; to <HI>Kyne|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on,</HI> 8 more; and to <HI>Warwick,</HI> 8 more.</P>
<P>'Tis &s;eated on the Banks of the River <HI>Avon,</HI> over which it has a well compact Stone-Bridge. A Town adorned with very fair Hou&s;es, &s;pacious and well ordered Streets, with a fine Market-hou&s;e of free-Stone, &s;u&s;tained by &s;eve|ral Pillars. It contains two fair Pari&s;h-Churches, of which S. Maries is the chief. Here is al&s;o, for the Education of Youth, a free School; and, for decay'd Gentlemen, a well indowed Ho&s;pital. But the chief Beauty of it, as heretofore &s;o now, is a mo&s;t &s;tately and magnificent Ca&s;tle, the Seat of Sir <HI>Fulk Grevill,</HI> the late Lord <HI>Brooks,</HI> by whom it was repaired at his great co&s;t and charges. In &s;hort, this Town injoy's a good Trade, chiefly for Mault; and the rather as being the Place where the A&s;&s;izes and general Se&s;|&s;ions for the County are kept. Its Market, which is kept on Saturdays, is great, and well furni&s;hed with all &s;orts of Provi&s;i|ons.</P>
<P>But that which has added the mo&s;t Lu&s;tre to this Town is the honourary Titles where|with it has been dignify'd for &s;everal Ages. Of Earl, fir&s;t in the per&s;on of <HI>Henry de New|burg,</HI> Created Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> by Wi&s;liam
<PB N="232" REF="139">the Conquerour, Anno 1076; and continued in five more of his name, viz. <HI>Roger, Wil|liam, Waleran, Henry,</HI> and <HI>Thomas de Newburg.</HI> From whom it pa&s;&s;ed through &s;everal Fami|lies, either by Marriage or Bloud allied to the former. Till at la&s;t the Title of Earl was by King Henry VI, turned into that of Duke in the per&s;on of <HI>Henry Beauchamp,</HI> who was made and crowned King of the I&s;les of <HI>Wight, Jer&s;ey,</HI> and <HI>Garn&s;ey,</HI> and &s;oon after created Duke of <HI>Warwick.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis true the Title of Duke went no fur|ther, and that of Earl was renewed in the per&s;on of <HI>Richard Nevil,</HI> who married <HI>Ann</HI> the Duke's Si&s;ter. From him it went to <HI>George,</HI> Duke of <HI>Clarence,</HI> who married <HI>Ann</HI> Daughter of <HI>Richard Nevil;</HI> and from <HI>George,</HI> to <HI>Edward Plantagenet,</HI> his Son. From the&s;e it came to two <HI>Dud eys</HI> &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, to wit <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Ambro&s;e,</HI> de&s;cended from the Lady <HI>Margaret,</HI> Daughter of <HI>Richard Beauchamp,</HI> Earl of <HI>Warwick.</HI> And in the Year 1618. King James I. conferred it upon <HI>Robert,</HI> Lord <HI>Rich</HI> of <HI>Leeze;</HI> in who&s;e Line it con|tinued, till <HI>Charles</HI> his great Grand&s;on died without I&s;&s;ue. Upon who&s;e Death, <HI>Robert Rich</HI> Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> his Cou&s;in german, &s;ucceeded in the Earldom of <HI>Warwick,</HI> and &s;o injoy'd both Titles. Which fell by his Death to his Son, the Right Honourable <HI>Edward Rich,</HI> the pre&s;ent Earl of <HI>War|wick.</HI></P>
<P>Near Warwick is a Cliff, mo&s;t delectably &s;eated among Groves and fre&s;h Streams; and called <HI>Guy-Cliff,</HI> from the Hercules of England, <HI>Guy</HI> of <HI>Warwick.</HI> Who, having left off his noble and valiant Exploits, betook him&s;elf (as the Story &s;ay's) to this Place, where he
<PB N="233" REF="139">led a kind of Hermetical Life, and built a Chappel wherein he was interred.</P>
<P>But, though Warwick be the County-Town, and a con&s;iderable Place upon other accounts; yet here is another of greater im|portance, which therefore doth de&s;erve a par|ticular De&s;cription in this place, before we proceed to the Li&s;t of the Market-Towns. And that is</P>
<P><HI>Coventry,</HI> a City &s;o called from an old Con|vent (or Mona&s;tery) founded by King Ca|nute. It &s;tands upon a &s;mall Stream, called <HI>Sherborn,</HI> which joyning with another Stream runs not far from thence into the River Avon. 'Tis a fair, neat, and large City; beautify'd with hand&s;om Hou&s;es, and &s;pacious Streets, be&s;ides a Cro&s;s of curious Workman&s;hip, and its two Churches of St. Michael and of the Holy Trinity that are loftily built. It was formerly begirt with a fine Wall, with 13 Gates giving entrance into the City; and what with the Convent and the tran&s;lating the See Epi&s;copal from Lich&s;ield hither it grew exceeding rich and wealthy. 'Tis true now it has neither Convent nor Epi&s;|copal See, more than in the Ruin and Title; and yet it does &s;till continue its old Wealth, being the be&s;t City for Trade in all the&s;e Parts, and more than ordinarily frequented for an Inland Town. Among other its Ma|nufactures, here are great quanti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ies of Cloths made and vended. And its Market for Pro|vi&s;ions is kept on Fridays.</P>
<P>It belonged once unto the Earls of Che&s;ter, and after wards by many Conveniances to John of Eltham Earl of Cornwal, whereby it be|came annexed to that Earldom. Nor did it lo&s;e any thing, but rather gain much, by
<PB N="234" REF="140">that Annexation; Henry the VI, laying un|to it &s;everal adjacent Towns and Villages, and making it with them a County Corporate, clearly di&s;tinct from that of Warwick. Thus Coventry, though within the Confines of War|wick&s;hire, became exempted from its Juri&s;|diction. And, in the very fir&s;t Year of the Reign of William the Conquerour, it was ho|noured with the Title of an Earldom in the Per&s;on of <HI>Edwin</HI> a Saxon, with whom the Title died, and lay buried till the Reign of King James I, when <HI>George Villiers</HI> (the late Duke of Buckingham's Father) was created Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and Earl of <HI>Coventry,</HI> Anno 1623.</P>

<P>The <HI>Air,</HI> by rea&s;on tho&s;e Hills and the Northern Situation of the Country, is very &s;harp and piercing, and not &s;o &s;ubject to the Fogs as many other Counties. Whereby the People are very healthfull, free from &s;trange and infectious Di&s;ea&s;es, and commonly live to a great Age.</P>
<PB N="237" REF="141">
<P>As for <HI>Rivers,</HI> this County is very well watered. The principal of which are the <HI>Eden,</HI> the <HI>Can,</HI> or <HI>Ken,</HI> the <HI>Lon,</HI> and the <HI>Ea|mon.</HI> The <HI>Can,</HI> of &s;ome note for its two Cataracts, or Water-falls, near <HI>Kendall,</HI> where the Waters de&s;cend with a great fall and noi&s;e. From which the Country-people have made this Ob&s;ervation, that when the North Water|fall &s;ounds clearer and louder than the other, 'tis a certain pre&s;age of fair Weather. But, when the other does &s;o, they expect rainy Weather.</P>
<P>Here are al&s;o two noted <HI>Lakes,</HI> or Meers, the one called <HI>&V;lles Water,</HI> and the other <HI>Winder</HI> (or <HI>Wimander</HI>) Meer; the fir&s;t bordering both upon Cumberland and We&s;tmorland, and the la&s;t upon this County and Lanca&s;hire, where you will find it de&s;cribed.</P>
<P><HI>Kendall,</HI> or <HI>Candale,</HI> the Shire Town, from whence one of the Wards (or Divi&s;ions) has the Name of <HI>Kendall</HI> Ward, bears from Lon|don North-We&s;t and by North, and is di&s;tant therefrom 201 miles, thus. From London to <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> 181 miles, the particulars whereof you may &s;ee in <HI>Lanca&s;tire;</HI> and from Lanca&s;ter to <HI>Kendall,</HI> 14.</P>
<P>It is &s;eated in a Dale, on the River <HI>Ken,</HI> whence it had the Name; built in the man|ner of a Cro&s;s, two long and broad Streets thwarting one another, be&s;ides &s;ome by-Streets. The &s;ame is a rich, populous, and well-traded Town; e&s;pecially for the making of woolen Cloth, Druggets, Serges, Hats, and wor&s;ted Stockings, whereby the poor people are im|ployed, and the adjacent Parts inriched. Over the River it has two fair Stone-Bridges; be&s;ides another of Wood, which leads to the Ruins of a Ca&s;tle, the Birth-place of Queen
<PB N="238" REF="142">Catherine, the &s;ixth Wife to King Henry VIII. Here is a fair and large Church, to which (as the Pari&s;h-Church) belong 12 Chappels of Ea&s;e. And by the Church-yard &s;tands a Free-School, being a large Building, well in|dowed with good Exhibitions for poor Scho|lars, going from hence to Queens Colledge in Oxford. Here are al&s;o in this Town &s;even Companies, viz. the Mercers, Shearmen, Cordwainers, Tanners, Glovers, Taylors, and Pewterers, having their re&s;pective Halls for managing their Concerns. And, for Pro|vi&s;ions, here is a great Market, which is kept on Saturdays.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, this Town is an ancient Barony. Noted be&s;ides for giving the Title of an Earl to <HI>John</HI> Duke of <HI>Bedford,</HI> Regent of France; and to <HI>John de Foix,</HI> created Earl hereof by King Henry VI.</P>

<P><HI>Appleby,</HI> the <HI>Abellaba</HI> of the ancient Ro|mans, is memorable for its Antiquity.

<PB N="239" REF="142">once of good Strength, in the nether end the Church, and not far from it a free School. In the Ea&s;t &s;ide of the Street leading to the Ca&s;tle is an Amls-Hou&s;e (or Ho&s;pital) found|ed and liberally indowed by the Lady Clifford. Where, about the Year 1652, &s;he placed a decea&s;ed Mini&s;ter's Wife, with her 12 Daugh|ters, whereof eleven Widows, and the twelfth a maimed Maid. She al&s;o purcha&s;ed Lands (which &s;he &s;ettled upon Feoffees in Tru&s;t) for the Repairing of the Church then very ruinous, the School-Hou&s;e, the Moot (or Town) Hall, and the Bridge, as Occa&s;ion re|quired. In this Town the A&s;&s;izes and Be&s;&s;ions are u&s;ually held.</P>
<P><HI>Kirby Lon&s;dale,</HI> that is, the Church-Town in <HI>Lon&s;dale,</HI> is &s;eated on the Banks of the Ri|ver <HI>Lon,</HI> in the plea&s;ant and rich Vale of <HI>Lon&s;|dale,</HI> towards Lanca&s;hire. A large, and well|built Town, well inhabited and re&s;orted unto, being the greate&s;t Town in the County, ex|cept <HI>Kendale.</HI> Beautified with a fair Church, and a large Stone-Bride, and driving a good Trade for Cloth. This Place gives Name to one of the four Divi&s;ions of the County, from hence called <HI>Lon&s;dale Ward,</HI> of &s;ome note be&s;ides, for the many deep and hollow Caves near it.</P>
<P><HI>Kirby Stephens,</HI> a goodly Town, is &s;eated in Ea&s;t ward, near the Skirts of the Hills which &s;ever this County from York&s;hire. Beautified with a fair Church, and much improved by the Trade of making Stockings. Near this Town is <HI>Wharton-Hall,</HI> a Seat belonging to the Lord <HI>Wharton.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Burton,</HI> an indifferent Town, &s;tands in a Valley, near the great Hill called <HI>Farleton-Knot-Hill.</HI> And <HI>Orton,</HI> among the Heaths, is &s;o
<PB N="240" REF="143">de&s;titute of Wood, that the people &s;ay, they han't &s;o much as a Stick to hang a Dog on.</P>
<P>I pa&s;s by the other Towns, as incon&s;ide|rable, to take notice of the Stone-Cro&s;s upon <HI>Stainmore-Hill,</HI> a Hill &s;o called for its being exceeding &s;tony, <HI>Stain</HI> in the North being the Word u&s;ed for a Stone. The Cro&s;s &s;aid to be erected upon a Peace concluded between William the Conquerour and Malcolm King of Scotland, with the Arms of the King of En|gland on the South-&s;ide, and tho&s;e of the King of Scotland on the North-&s;ide. Which &s;erved for a Boundary, as the Ca&s;e &s;tood then, be|twixt the two Kingdoms.</P>
<P>In the North-We&s;t Parts, at the joyning of the River Eamont with the Lowther, is <HI>Whin|feld Forest,</HI> and hard by it, <HI>Brougham-Ca&s;tle,</HI> which by the Coyns &amp;c. that have been there digged up &s;eems to have been a Place of good account in the time of the Romans.</P>
<P>By the High-Way &s;ide, leading between Lowther and Eamont Bridges, is a large Circle of Ground with a fair Plain in the mid&s;t. Which the Country-people give out to be the Place made u&s;e of by the Knight of the Round Table for their Tilts and Turnaments, there being two oppo&s;ite Pa&s;&s;es to make their Approaches in. And accord|ingly they call it <HI>King Arthur's Table.</HI></P>

<P>On the Banks of the Lowther is <HI>Lowther-Hall,</HI> the Seat of Sir <HI>John Lowther</HI> Baronet. Who&s;e Family has there flouri&s;hed &s;o long a time, that they reckon 30 De&s;cents lineally from Father to Son, and the greate&s;t part of 'em Knights. Neither do's the Hou&s;e only carry the Name of the Family, but al&s;o the Park belonging to it, the Pari&s;h, and (which is remarkable) the very River, with the Bridge over it.</P>
<P>To conclude, this County (formerly a Part of the Kingdom of the <HI>Northumbers,</HI> and its Inhabitants part of the <HI>Brigantes,</HI> as the Ro|mans called them) &s;tands now divided betwixt the Dioce&s;es of <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Carli&s;le.</HI></P>
<P>Out of it are elected, be&s;ides the two Knights of the Shire, but two Members of Parlia|ment, and <HI>Appleby</HI> has the Right of Electi|on.</P>
<P>As for honourary Titles, this County be|gan to be dignify'd with the Title of an Earldom in the Reign of Richard II.

<P><HI>WILTSHIRE,</HI> an Inland County, is bounded <HI>on the Ea&s;t</HI> with Bark&s;hire and Hamp|&s;hire; <HI>on the We&s;t,</HI> with Somer&s;et&s;hire; <HI>North|ward,</HI> by Gloce&s;ter&s;hire; and <HI>Southward,</HI> by Dor&s;et&s;hire.</P>
<P>Called <HI>Wilt&s;hire</HI> from <HI>Wilton,</HI> once the chief Town of it; as this is from the River <HI>Willy,</HI> upon which it is &s;eated.</P>
<P>It contains in <HI>Length,</HI> from North to South, at lea&s;t 40 miles; in <HI>Breadth,</HI> from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, 30. The Whole divided into 29 <HI>Hun|dreds,</HI> wherein 304 <HI>Pari&s;hes,</HI> and 23 <HI>Market-Towns.</HI></P>
<P>A Country not only plea&s;ant and delight|&s;om, but withall very plentifull. Its Northern Part, called <HI>North Wilt&s;hire,</HI> has very plea&s;ant Hills, and well cloathed with Woods. The <HI>Southern Parts</HI> are more even, and yield plenty both of Gra&s;s and Corn. But the <HI>Middle Parts,</HI> called the Plains, are mo&s;t &s;cant of Corn. Yet as they are wonderfull large and &s;pacious, reaching round about to the Horizon, they feed &s;uch innumerable Flocks of Sheep, that the Inhabitants find a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> much profit by their Fleece, and the gainful Trade of Cloathing, as others do by their more fertile Grounds.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Rivers,</HI> here is the <HI>I&s;is,</HI> which with the <HI>Tame</HI> makes up the Thames. The <HI>Kennet</HI> which runs We&s;tward from this County through Bark&s;hire into the Thames. The <HI>Avon</HI> (a Name common to many Engli&s;h Ri|vers) which runs from North to South, and then bending its Cour&s;e to the We&s;tward fal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> into the Severn not far from Bri&s;tol.

Be&s;ides &s;everal le&s;&s;er Streams, among which is the <HI>Deverill,</HI> which runs a mile under Ground.</P>
<P>Now, before I proceed any further in my u&s;ual Method, it will not be improper to take notice in this Place of two Remarkable Things in this County, viz. the <HI>Wan&s;dike,</HI> and <HI>Stone-henge.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t is a Dike running for many miles from We&s;t to Ea&s;t in the mid&s;t of this Shire, and which (according to the vulgar Opinion) was ca&s;t up by the Devil upon a Wedne&s;day, from whence the Name of <HI>Wan&s;|dike.</HI> But, as Cambden ob&s;erveth, it was ra|ther made by the We&s;t-Saxons, for the di|viding of their Kingdom from that of the Mercians; this being the Place where they u&s;ually fought, in order to &s;tretch the Bounds of their Dominions.</P>
<P><HI>Stone-henge,</HI> the greater Wonder of the two, and indeed the mo&s;t admirable Rarity this I&s;land affords, is a &s;tupendious Piece of Work. It con&s;i&s;ts of huge Stones, &s;tanding upright in three Ranks round like a Crown, and laid overthwart one another; &s;ome of which are 28 foot high, and 7 broad. Now the Que&s;tion is, how the&s;e Stones came hither. For the whole Country round for &s;ome miles hardly affords a Stone, either great or &s;mall; and the&s;e &s;eem too va&s;t to be brought hi|ther by Wagon, Cart, or any other Arti|fice. Cambden therefore is of Opinion, that
<PB N="244" REF="145">they were made there by Art, of pure Sand and &s;ome unctuous Cement, the Ancients having had the Art of making Stone. Thus the Ce&s;terns of Rome were made of Sand digged out of the Ground, which with the &s;tronge&s;t kind of Lime wrought together be|came &s;o hard, that they &s;eemed Stones.</P>
<P><HI>Salisbury,</HI> the chief Place of this County, is reckoned 70 miles We&s;t-South-We&s;t from London, thus. From London to <HI>New Brent|ford,</HI> 8 miles; thence to <HI>Stanes,</HI> 7; to <HI>Hart|ley-row,</HI> 16 more; from thence to <HI>Ba&s;ing|&s;toke,</HI> 8; thence to <HI>Whitchurch,</HI> 10; to <HI>Ando|ver,</HI> 6 more; and from Andover to <HI>Salisbury,</HI> 15.</P>
<P>This is the City otherwi&s;e called <HI>New Sarum,</HI> rai&s;ed out of an old one known to the Romans by the Name of <HI>Sorbiodunum,</HI> which was drily &s;eated on a great Eminence, being a Place only de&s;igned for Strength. Yet it was for &s;ome time honoured with an Epi&s;|copal See, and a fair Cathedral. As to the pre&s;ent City, 'tis plea&s;antly &s;eated among &s;e|veral Rivers, who&s;e Streams do commodi|ou&s;ly water mo&s;t of the Streets; and almo&s;t incompa&s;&s;ed with open Fields and Plains, which take their Name from it. In which Plains, about 6 miles di&s;tance, is to be &s;een the <HI>Stone-henge,</HI> as before de&s;cribed. In &s;hort, this City for fair Buildings is inferiour to none, and tran&s;cends all others for the benefit of Water, almo&s;t every Street having a River running through the mid&s;t thereof, among which the <HI>Avon</HI> is the principal. The Streets are large and &s;pacious, accommodated with a fine Market-Place, and adorned with a fair Building, the Town-Hall. But the greate&s;t Ornament of this City, and indeed one of
<PB N="245" REF="145">the principal Ornaments of England, is the Cathedral, a mo&s;t &s;tately and magnificent Church. Which, being begun by <HI>Richard Poore</HI> Bi&s;hop of this See, and fini&s;hed in the Year 1258. by <HI>Bridport,</HI> the third Bi&s;hop from him, was dedicated to the honour of the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin. This Church has 12 Gates, 52 Windows, and 365 Pillars great and &s;mall; the fir&s;t an&s;wering to the Number of Months, the &s;econd to that of the Weeks, and the third to the Number of Days, in the Year. Its Steeple has a lofty Spire, which proudly &s;hews it &s;elf from a great di&s;tance. And (which is remarkable) an Imperial Crown &s;tood at the very top of all, which by a &s;udden Gu&s;t of Wind was thrown down to the Ground at the very time when the late King James was at Salisbury, in order to oppo&s;e the Prince of Orange's Forces coming this way from the We&s;t. Which two days after was followed by his De&s;ertion of that Place, and &s;oon after by the De&s;ertion of the Crown and Government.</P>
<P>Moreover, this City has been for &s;everal Ages honoured with the Title of an Earldom, 1. in the per&s;ons of <HI>Patrick</HI> and <HI>William D'Ev|reux,</HI> &s;ucce&s;&s;ively. 2.

A Town &s;tretched out from Ea&s;t to We&s;t upon the a&s;cent of a Hill, watered by the Kennet, not far from the head of it; and having the conveniency both of a Fore&s;t and Cha&s;e in its Neighbour|hood, the fir&s;t called <HI>Savernake-Fore&s;t,</HI> and the
<PB N="247" REF="146">other <HI>Aldburn Cha&s;e.</HI> It had once a Ca&s;tle belonging unto John, &s;urnamed <HI>Sans Terre,</HI> who afterwards was King of England.

But King Charles 1. at this Coronation made it yet more notable, in making it the Honour, as it was the Neigh|bour, of <HI>James</HI> Lord <HI>Ley,</HI> Lord Trea&s;urer, created by that King Earl of <HI>Marlbourough</HI> An|no 1625. Which Title continued in three Per&s;ons more of his Name and Family; and, &s;ince the late Revolution, was conferred by our pre&s;ent King upon the Right Honourable <HI>John Churchill,</HI> the pre&s;ent Earl of <HI>Marlborough.</HI> This Town has &s;uffered very much by the fre|quent Misfortune of Fire, under which it groans to this day.</P>

<P><HI>Malmesbury,</HI> another good Town, &s;tands in the North-We&s;t Parts of the County, plea|&s;antly &s;eated on a Hill, near the Spring of the River <HI>Avon,</HI> over which it has &s;ix Bridges, being almo&s;t incircled with that River.</P>
<P><HI>Chippenham</HI> and <HI>Bradford</HI> are al&s;o &s;eated on the Avon; and <HI>Troubridge,</HI> near it; <HI>Amer&s;|bury,</HI> or <HI>Ambresbury,</HI> (commonly pronounced <HI>Ambsbury</HI>) on the other Avon, near the <HI>Stone-henge,</HI> and but 6 miles North of Sali&s;|bury.

<P>I pa&s;s by the re&s;t as Incon&s;iderable, to take notice of <HI>Clarendon;</HI> a fine &s;pacious Park lying near to and Ea&s;tward of Salisbury.

Adorned in Times pa&s;t with a Royal Hou&s;e, which in proce&s;s of time is faln|to ruin. But more remarkable for that in the Reign of Henry the Second, Anno 1164, here was made a certain Recognition and Re|cord of the Cu&s;toms and Liberties of the Kings of England before the Prelates and Peers of the Kingdom, for the avoiding Di&s;|&s;entions between the Clergy, the Judges, and Barons of the R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lm.

<P>To conclude, this County (which formerly was Part of the Kingdom of the <HI>We&s;t-Saxons,</HI> and its Inhabitants part of the <HI>Belgae,</HI> as the Romans called them) is now in the Dioce&s;e of <HI>Salisbury.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Worce&s;ter|&s;hire.</HEAD>
<P><HI>WORCESTERSHIRE,</HI> an In|land County, is bounded <HI>on the Ea&s;t</HI> by Warwick&s;hire, and part of Gloce&s;ter&s;hire; <HI>on the We&s;t,</HI> by Hereford|&s;hire, and part of Shrop&s;hire; <HI>on the North,</HI> by Stafford&s;hire; and <HI>on the South,</HI> by Glo|ce&s;ter&s;hire.</P>
<P>It contains in <HI>Length,</HI> from North to South, about 35 miles; in <HI>Breadth,</HI> from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, about 25. The Whole divided into &s;e|ven <HI>Hundreds,</HI> wherein 152 <HI>Pari&s;hes,</HI> and 11 <HI>Market-Towns.</HI></P>
<P>A County of an <HI>Air</HI> &s;o temperate, and a <HI>Soil</HI> &s;o fortunate, that it gives place to none about it, either for health or plenty. Abun|dant certainly it is in all &s;orts of Fruits this Climate can afford, Pears and Cherries e&s;pe|cially, in&s;omuch that here is made abun|dance of Perry. Here are al&s;o many Salt-pits, called <HI>Wiches,</HI> which yield excellent Salt, and &s;uch as for whitene&s;s and hardne&s;s imitateth Loaf-Sugar.</P>
<P>'Tis true this County is pretty full of Hills, but &s;uch Hills as are not barren, yielding plen|ty of Wood and &s;tore of Pa&s;turage; whil&s;t the Valleys on the other &s;ide feed abundance of Cattle, and bear good Crops of Corn.</P>
<PB N="252" REF="149">
<P>Through the&s;e Valleys run &s;o many Rivers, that few Counties are better watered with fre&s;h Streams. Here we meet again that noble River, the <HI>Severn,</HI> which runs quite through the Country from North to South, and affords here great &s;tore of fre&s;h-Water Lampreys. Be&s;ides the <HI>Avon,</HI> the <HI>Team,</HI> the <HI>Salwarp,</HI> &amp;c. which run into the Severn, and yield abundance of Fi&s;h.</P>
<P><HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> the chief Place hereof, and from whence the County is denominated, bears from London We&s;t-North-We&s;t, and is di&s;tant therefrom near upon 90 miles, thus. From London to <HI>Oxford</HI> 47 miles, as you may &s;ee afterwards in my De&s;cription of Oxford; from thence to <HI>Chipping-Norton,</HI> 12; and to <HI>Campden,</HI> 12 more; thence to <HI>Per&s;hore,</HI> 10; and to <HI>Wor|cester,</HI> 6 more.</P>
<P>Plea&s;antly &s;eated on the Ea&s;t Bank of the Severn, over which it has a fair Stone-Bridge with a Tower upon it, and thence ari&s;ing with a gentle a&s;cent affords to the upper Parts a very goodly Pro&s;pect in the Vale beneath. A City every way con&s;iderable, for Situation, neat Buildings, Number of Churches, and Wealth of the Inhabitants, by rea&s;on of their Cloth-Trade which does here flouri&s;h very much.</P>
<P>This City called by Antonine and Pto|lomy <HI>Branonium,</HI> and by the Romans <HI>Vigor|nia,</HI> is &s;aid to have been fir&s;t built by the Romans, the better to &s;ecure them&s;elves from the Britains beyond the Severn. But in the time of King Canute, it &s;uftered much from the Danes, and afterwards by frequent Con|flagrations, which laid it almo&s;t wa&s;te, and de&s;pairing of a Recovery. Yet it ro&s;e at la&s;t out of its A&s;hes, and by degrees &s;o impro|ved as to contain at pre&s;ent nine Pari&s;h-Churches,
<PB N="253" REF="149">be&s;ides the Cathedral. This is a &s;tately Structure, in who&s;e Quire are the Monuments of King John in white Marble, and of Arthur Prince of Wales, and Son to Henry VII. in blak Jeat. The Ca&s;tle I &s;hall &s;ay nothing of, as having nothing left of it but the Name and Ruins.</P>
<P>But <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> is particularly memorable for the Battel fought there Sept. 3. 1651. be|twixt the late King Charles and the Par|liament Forces, wherein the King's Army was totally defeated. So that he was fain to &s;hift for him&s;elf, and to wander &s;ix Weeks in Di&s;gui&s;e about the Country, till he was at laft tran&s;ported from a Creek near Sho|ram in Su&s;&s;ex to <HI>Feccam</HI> near <HI>Havre de Grace</HI> in France.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, this City has a long time given the Title of Earl, and at la&s;t that of Marque&s;s, to the Family of the <HI>Somer&s;ets,</HI> extracted by the <HI>Beauforts</HI> from <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Gaunt.</HI> For <HI>Charles Somer&s;et,</HI> who was created Earl of <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> by King Henry VIII, was ba&s;e Son of <HI>Henry Beaufort,</HI> the 8th Duke of <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> beheaded in Edward the fourth's Reign.</P>

<P><HI>Eve&s;ham</HI> (or <HI>Eve&s;holm</HI>) and <HI>Per&s;hore</HI> are both &s;eated on the Avon, over which they have each a Bridge.

<HEAD>York&s;hire.</HEAD>
<P><HI>YORKSHIRE,</HI> a Maritime County, and the greate&s;t in the whole Kingdom, is bounded <HI>Ea&s;tward</HI> by the German Ocean; <HI>We&s;tward,</HI> by Lanca&s;hire and We&s;tmorland; <HI>Northward,</HI> by the &s;aid Ocean, and the Bi&s;hoprick of Durham, from which parted by the River Tees; and <HI>Southward,</HI> by Lincoln, Nottingham, and Derby Shires.</P>
<P>Its <HI>Length,</HI> from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, is 80 miles; its <HI>Breadth,</HI> from North to South, 70. The Whole divided fir&s;t into three Parts, called <HI>Ridings,</HI> viz. the <HI>Ea&s;t, We&s;t,</HI> and <HI>North Ri|ding.</HI> Which together contain 26 <HI>Wapentakes</HI> or <HI>Hundreds,</HI> wherein 563 <HI>Pari&s;h-Churches,</HI> and 49 <HI>Market-Towns.</HI> A &s;mall number of Pa|ri&s;hes for &s;uch an Extent of Ground, but that there are great many Chappels of Ea&s;e, e|qual for bigne&s;ss and re&s;ort of people to any Pari&s;h el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>The <HI>East-Riding</HI> (which is by much the lea&s;t of the three) takes up only that part of York&s;hire which lies between the River Der|went
<PB N="256" REF="151">went and the Sea. The <HI>North-Riding</HI> takes up the North Parts as far as We&s;tmorland. And the <HI>We&s;t-Riding,</HI> the large&s;t of the three, is bounded on the North by the two former <HI>Ridings,</HI> on the South by the Counties of Derby, Nottingham, and Che&s;hire, Ea&s;tward by Lincoln&s;hire, and We&s;tward by Lanca|&s;hire.</P>
<P>The <HI>Soil</HI> is generally fruitfull, in a very good mea&s;ure. And, (as &s;ays <HI>Speed,</HI>) if one Part thereof is &s;tony and barren Ground, another is as fertile and richly adorned with Corn and Pa&s;turage. If here you find it naked and de&s;titute of Woods, in other Places you &s;hall find it &s;hadowed with mo&s;t &s;pacious Fore&s;ts. If it be &s;omewhere moori&s;h, miry, and un|plea&s;ant, el&s;ewhere it is as plea&s;ant as the Eye can wi&s;h.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Rivers,</HI> here are many of good note. For, be&s;ides the <HI>Tees</HI> which parts this County from Durham, here you will find the <HI>Swale,</HI> the <HI>Youre,</HI> and the <HI>Nyd,</HI> of which the <HI>Ou&s;e</HI> at York is a Compound. Be&s;ides the <HI>Warfe,</HI> the <HI>Are,</HI> the <HI>Calder,</HI> and <HI>Derwent,</HI> which from &s;everal Parts fall into the Ou&s;e below York. To which add the <HI>Dun,</HI> which &s;evers part of this County from Lincoln&s;hire; and the <HI>Hull,</HI> which falls into the Humber at Hull. As for the <HI>Humber,</HI> which is the large&s;t of all, it cannot be &s;aid properly to be a di|&s;tinct River, but rather a Compound, or a Mouth, of &s;everal Rivers joyning into one Stream, as I have already hinted in the be|ginning of this Part.</P>
<P><HI>York,</HI> (in Latin <HI>Eboracum</HI>) the chief Place of York&s;hire, bears from London North-by-We&s;t, and is di&s;tant therefrom 150 miles; thus. From London to <HI>Huntington,</HI> 48 miles,

<P>A City which, for fame and greatne&s;s, is the &s;econd City of England. It is in the <HI>North-Riding,</HI> &s;ituate on the River <HI>Ou&s;e,</HI> which divides it into two Parts, but joyned toge|ther by a &s;tately Stone-Bridge. Of which two Parts, that towards the Ea&s;t is the mo&s;t po|pulous, the Hou&s;es &s;tanding thicker, and the Streets narrower. In general, 'tis a fair, large, and beautifull City, adorned with ma|ny fair Buildings both publick and private, and inclo&s;ed with a &s;trong Wall, with &s;everal Turrets upon it. A City rich and popu|lous, well inhabited by Gentry and wealthy Trade&s;men, and containing about 30 Pari&s;h-Churches and Chappels, be&s;ides its Cathedral, dedicated to St. Peter. Fir&s;t built by <HI>Edwyn,</HI> the fir&s;t Chri&s;tian King of the Northumbers Anno 627, and fini&s;hed by King <HI>O&s;wald</HI> his next Succe&s;&s;or but one. But, being after|wards de&s;troyed by Fire, and by the fury of the Danes, that which now &s;tands was ere|cted in the place thereof by Archbi&s;hop <HI>Tho|mas,</HI> the 25th of this See, and after by de|grees adorned and beautify'd by his Succe&s;&s;ors. Of that magnificent Structure, which may ju&s;t|ly put her in the fir&s;t Rank of the Cathe|drals in Europe.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the Romans of old had this City in &s;uch great e&s;teem, that <HI>Severus</HI> their Emperour had his Palace here, where he ended his Days. Here al&s;o, upon the Death of <HI>Fl. Va|lerius Con&s;tantius,</HI> &s;urnamed <HI>Chlorus,</HI> his Son
<PB N="258" REF="152"><HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> was forthwith proclaimed Empe|rour. Nor did this City flouri&s;h only under the Romans, for it has been of as eminent Repu|tation in all Ages &s;ince; and in the &s;everal Turns and Changes which have befallen this Kingdom, under the Saxons, Danes, and Nor|mans, has &s;till pre&s;erved its ancient Lu&s;tre. Adorned it was with an Archbi&s;hops See in the time of the Britains; nor &s;tooped it low|er when the Saxons imbraced the Go&s;pel. Richard II, laying unto it a little Territory on the We&s;t-&s;ide thereof, made it a County Incorporate, as our Lawyers term it; in which the Archbi&s;hops of York injoy the Right of Palatines. It is governed, as Lon|don, by a Lord Mayor, London and York being the only Cities who&s;e Mayors bear the Title of Lord. But not &s;o much famed by that, as by the Title of Duke it has given to divers Princes of the Royal Bloud; and par|ticularly to the late King James, before he came to the Crown.</P>

<P><HI>Gisborough</HI> is plea&s;antly &s;eated in a Flat, between Mulgrave and the River Tees. A mean Town to what it was, when it had its rich Abbey; but of &s;ome note however, for being the fir&s;t place where Allum was made in England. Not far from which is <HI>Ro&s;eberry-Topping,</HI> a Hill Pyramid-like, &s;erving to Sail|ers for a Land-Mark, and being to the Coun|try-people a certain Sign of Rain, when they &s;ee a Cloud over it. Almo&s;t at the top of it is a Spring of Water coming out of a huge Rock, counted good for &s;ore Eyes.</P>
<PB N="273" REF="159">
<P><HI>Stoke&s;ley</HI> is a Market-Town well watered with fre&s;h Streams. <HI>Yarum,</HI> but a mean Town, is &s;eated on the <HI>Tees,</HI> which divides this County from the Bi&s;hoprick of Dur|ham, and over which it has a fair Stone-Bridge. <HI>North-Allerton,</HI> a large Borough-Town, &s;tands near the <HI>Wisk,</HI> a &s;mall Stream that falls into the Swale. And <HI>Thirsk</HI> is a &s;mall Bo|rough-Town that had once a very &s;trong Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P><HI>Bedal, Middleham,</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;ham</HI> are all three in Richmond&s;hire. The fir&s;t, &s;eated on the <HI>Swale,</HI> and a &s;mall Stream that falls there into it, <HI>Middleham</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;ham,</HI> on the <HI>Youre.</HI> And not far from Ma&s;ham is <HI>Aldborough,</HI> an ancient Borough-Town.</P>
<P><HI>New Malton, Pickering, Kirby-More&s;ide,</HI> and <HI>Helmley,</HI> ly all four Ea&s;tward, not far di&s;tant from each other, nor from the Sea. The fir&s;t, a Borough-Town, is &s;eated on the Banks of the River <HI>Derwent,</HI> over which it has a Stone-bridge; and contains 3 Pari&s;h Churches, being well-inhabited, and accommodated with good Inns for Travellers. Its Market on Saturdays is counted one of the be&s;t in all the County for Hor&s;es, living Cattle, Pro|vi&s;ions, and mo&s;t Country-Commodities, e&s;|pecially Tools for Husbandry. The other three are all &s;eated on &s;mall Rivers, which after &s;ome &s;mall Cour&s;e joyn together into one Stream, and &s;o fall into the <HI>Derwent,</HI> a little below New Malton.</P>
<P>To conclude, this County (formerly a Part of the Kingdom of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and its In|habitants Part of the <HI>Brigantes,</HI> as the Ro|mans called them,) is now in the Dioce&s;e of <HI>York.</HI></P>
<P>Out of it are elected, be&s;ides the two Knights of the Shire, 28 Members of Par|liament;
<PB N="274" REF="160">Viz. Two by each of the&s;e following Towns, <HI>York, King&s;ton upon Hull, Knaresborough, Scarborough, Rippon, Richmond, Heydon, Borough|bridge, Malton, Thirsk, Aldborough, Beverly, North-Allerton, Pomfret.</HI></P>
<P>And, which is remarkable, it yields at this time two <HI>Dukes,</HI> and one <HI>Dutche&s;s,</HI> one <HI>Mar|que&s;s,</HI> and nine <HI>Earls.</HI> The Dukes are of <HI>Rich|mond,</HI> and <HI>Bolton;</HI> the Dutche&s;s, of <HI>Cleveland;</HI> the Marque&s;s, of <HI>Halifax;</HI> the Earls, of <HI>Mulgrave, King&s;ton, Strafford, Craven, Burlington, Holderne&s;s, Derwentwater, Faulconberg,</HI> and <HI>Scarborough.</HI></P>
<P>Thus I have compa&s;&s;ed a very difficult Task, the De&s;cription of forty Counties, with &s;o much variety of Matter, in &s;o &s;hort a Compa&s;s. The Reader perhaps expects in the next place, I &s;hould give an Account of the Twelve <HI>Counties</HI> of <HI>Wales,</HI> as being In|corporated with <HI>England,</HI> at lea&s;t in point of Government. But what Union &s;oever it may have with <HI>England,</HI> 'tis but like tho&s;e remote Cities conquered by the Romans, who&s;e Inhabitants were <HI>Civitate donati,</HI> that is, made Citizens of Rome. <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales</HI> are naturally &s;o di&s;tinct from each other, both as to the Country and the Inhabitants, that they cannot po&s;&s;ibly fall under the &s;ame Character. And &s;o I lay <HI>Wales</HI> a&s;ide to pre&s;ent you, by way of Precapitulation, with a <HI>Table,</HI> &s;hewing by di&s;tinct Columns the Number of <HI>Hundreds, Pari&s;hes,</HI> and <HI>Market-Towns</HI> belonging to every County of England, with the Names of the <HI>Shire-Towns.</HI> Only 'tis to be ob&s;erved that, in|&s;tead of <HI>Hundreds,</HI> Durham is divided into <HI>Wakes;</HI> Cumberland, We&s;tmorland, and Nor|thumberland, into <HI>Wards.</HI> Al&s;o, that &s;ome Counties are more generally divided than into
<PB N="275" REF="160"><HI>Hundreds;</HI> as York&s;hire, fir&s;t into three <HI>Ri|dings,</HI> Kent into five <HI>Lathes,</HI> Su&s;&s;ex into &s;ix <HI>Rapes,</HI> Lincon&s;hire into the&s;e three Parts, <HI>Lind|&s;ey, Ke&s;teven,</HI> and <HI>Holland.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of <HI>LONDON</HI> and <HI>WEST|MINSTER.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I Joyn the&s;e two together, becau&s;e conti|guous. And, tho' they be two di&s;tinct Cities, both by their Foundation and di&s;tinct Government; yet, as they make to|gether one compact Body, the City of We&s;t|min&s;ter, under that Notion, is generally com|prehended under the Name of London, and lookt upon as a Part of it. In the De&s;cri|ption whereof, I &s;hall joyn and part them, as occa&s;ion &s;hall offer.</P>
<P>My De&s;ign is not to make a long Pream|ble about the uncertain <HI>Original</HI> of <HI>LONDON,</HI> which (as &s;ome write) was built above eleven hundred Years before the Birth of our Saviour.
<PB N="277" REF="161">That it is a mo&s;t ancient City, is a thing pa&s;t all doubt. For Hi&s;tory tells us, that the Briti&s;h King <HI>Lud,</HI> above 60 Years before our Saviours Birth, repaired and improved it. The Romans, in who&s;e Time it was an Archbi&s;hop's See, gave it the Title of <HI>Au|gu&s;ta.</HI> And Animianus Marcellinus, who wrote near 1300 Years ago, calls it then an ancient City.</P>
<P>As for its <HI>Name,</HI> the mo&s;t probable Con|jecture in my Judgment is that of tho&s;e who derive it from the Briti&s;h Word <HI>Llongdin,</HI> a Town of Ships.</P>
<P>Its <HI>Situation</HI> is, upon all accounts, very ad|vantageous, whether we con&s;ider the Soil on which it &s;tands, the River that waters it, the Fruitfulne&s;s of the Country about it, the Roads that lead into it, or its convenient Di&s;tance from the Sea.</P>
<P>The Soil is gravelly, and therefore &s;o much the whol&s;omer. And, as it &s;tands upon a gentle ri&s;ing Bank, on the North-&s;ide of the River, this adds much to the healthfulne&s;s of the Place; the South-&s;ide being counted &s;omething unhealthy by rea&s;on of the Vapours the Sun draws upon it.</P>
<P>The Thames that waters it I have already de&s;cribed, as the chief River of England, and an excellent navigable River. This City &s;tands where the River is ca&s;t into the form of a Cre&s;cent; and &s;tretches it &s;elf in length along the Shore, as Cologne does upon the Rhine. Which is a great Advantage, upon &s;everal Accounts, e&s;pecially to a great City Fir&s;t, becau&s;e it ly's the more convenient for the &s;everal U&s;es and Benefits of the River. Se|condly, for the Freene&s;s of the Air; which makes it &s;o much the healthfuller; lying open
<PB N="278" REF="162">to the Fields Northward, and to the River Southward. Whereas Paris, and all other Cities of an orbicular Form, ly clo&s;e toge|ther, and the middle Parts half choackt for want of Air. To which add another Conve|niency in London by its Situation along the River, that by the Cour&s;e of it one may &s;ooner find out any Place than is po&s;&s;ible in Paris, which is a very Labyrinth in com|pari&s;on.</P>
<P>This River be&s;ides is full of excellent Fi&s;h, &s;uch as Barbels, Trouts, Chevins, Pearches, Smelts, Breams, Roaches, Daces, Gudgeons, Flounders, Shrimps, Eels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And, after the Smelt-time is pa&s;t, it yields al&s;o &s;weet Sal|mons. But Carps it is &s;carce of, except up|on Land-flouds, when they get out of Gen|tlemens Ponds. Great number of Swans are daily &s;een upon this River. Be&s;ides a per|petual Motion of Wherries and &s;mall Boats, above 2000 in Number, whereby 3000 Water|men are maintained, by carrying Goods and Pa&s;&s;engers thereon. Not counting tho&s;e large Tilt-Boats, Tide-Boats, and Barges, which ei|ther carry People, or bring Provi&s;ion from mo&s;t Parts of the neighbouring Coun|ties.</P>
<P>For Navigation, no River more commodi|ous, as may appear by a Pa&s;&s;age in the Reign of King James I. Who, being di&s;plea&s;|ed with the City, for refu&s;ing to lend him a Sum of Mony he required, threatned the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, that he would remove his Court, with all the Records of the Tower, and the Courts of We&s;tmin|&s;ter-Hall, to another Place, with further expre&s;&s;ions of his Indignation. Your Maje|&s;ty, an&s;wered the Lord Mayor calmly, may
<PB N="279" REF="162">do what you plea&s;e therein, and your City of London will prove &s;till dutifull; but &s;he comforts her &s;elf with the Thoughts, that your Maje&s;ty will leave the Thames behind you.</P>
<P>This River be&s;ides is &s;o Kind, that it &s;el|dom indamages any Part of this City by its Overflowings. Here the highe&s;t Tides are upon a Land-floud, and the Moon at full, when &s;ometimes it does &s;well over its Banks. But then We&s;tmin&s;ter, lying low, feels alone the effects of it, and that &s;eldom further than the Cellars. Whereas the Chambers and Upper Rooms at Rome and Paris are &s;ome|times overflowed, Rome by the Tiber, and Paris by the Seine.</P>
<P>From this River the City, by Water-En|gines, is in many places &s;upplied with good Water. But, to &s;erve with Water the North Parts of the City, as the Thames does the South Parts, it has the Conveniency of an artificial River, commonly called the <HI>New River,</HI> which was begun Anno 1608, and fi|ni&s;hed in five Years time. A noble Under|taking of Sir <HI>Hugh Middleton,</HI> who for this great Work de&s;erves his Statue in Bra&s;s. This River he brought from Amwell and Chad|well, two Springs near <HI>Ware</HI> in Hartford&s;hire; from whence, in a turning and winding Cour&s;e, it runs near upon 60 miles, before it reach|es this City. In this Undertaking, fitter in|deed for a Prince than any Subject, there have been &s;ix hundred Men at once imploy|ed, which was a prodigious Charge. The Channel in &s;ome Places 30 foot deep, in o|thers carried over Valleys 20 foot at lea&s;t above Ground, in open Troughs. And over this River are 800 Bridges, &s;ome of Stone,
<PB N="280" REF="163">&s;ome of Wood, and others of Brick.</P>
<P>This City be&s;ides has the Conveniency of &s;everal Conduits of Spring-Water, &s;o com|modiou&s;ly placed, that they &s;erve all the chief Parts of it. And it is &s;o &s;ituated, that in all Parts (though on the highe&s;t Ground) 'tis abundantly &s;erved with Pump-Water, the Pumps in many Places not &s;ix foot deep in the Ground.</P>
<P>For a con&s;tant Supply of Provi&s;ions, be|&s;ides the fruitfull County of <HI>Middle&s;ex,</HI> in which it &s;tands, and that of <HI>Surrey</HI> on the other &s;ide of the River (both which are rea|dy at hand to furni&s;h it with their Provi&s;i|ons) it is neighboured with many other plentifull Counties, out of who&s;e abundance this City lives in great plenty, and &s;eldom knows what Scarcity is.</P>
<P>The Conveyance &s;o ea&s;y, both by Land and Water, that no City in Europe has bet|ter Conveniencies. So large, fair, and &s;mooth are the High Ways that lead from all Parts to it, and &s;o convenient is the River, that almo&s;t all the Fewel for firing is brought up that Way to Town. The Coals from New|ca&s;tle, and the Wood from Kent and E&s;&s;ex; &s;ome of which la&s;t comes al&s;o down the River from Surrey and Middle&s;ex. La&s;tly, as it has the Command of the Sea, &s;o there is &s;carce any Ble&s;&s;ing in the Terre&s;trial Globe but this City has her Share in it.</P>
<P>Moreover, its Di&s;tance from the Sea (which is about 60 Miles) is a great Argument of the Founder's Wi&s;dom. For, by that Di&s;tance, as it is not &s;o near as to be annoyed by the unwhol&s;om Vapours of the Sea, or to be &s;ud|denly &s;urpri&s;ed by an Enemies Fleet; &s;o it is not &s;o far but that, by the help of the
<PB N="281" REF="163">Tide (which comes up every 12 hours) Ships of great burden may be brought into her bo&s;om.</P>
<P>In point of Latitude, 'tis in 51 Degree, 30 Minutes.</P>
<P>I come now to its full <HI>Extent,</HI> with its Suburbs and Places adjacent. Its Length from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, that is, from Lime-hou&s;e to the further end of Mill-Bank in We&s;tmin|&s;ter, is above 7500 Geometrical Paces, which comes to &s;even mea&s;ured miles and an half, at 1000 paces a mile; that is, about five computed miles, or two Pari&s;ian Leagues and a half. The Breadth indeed is not pro|portionable, the City being built in Length for the Conveniency of the River. And yet, taking Southwark in on the other &s;ide of the River, as it is under the Lord May|or's Juri&s;diction, and joyned to London by the Bridge, this va&s;t City reaches there in Breadth, from North to South, that is, from the further end of White-Chappel Street to St. George's Fields in Southwark, near upon 3 miles. So that I cannot but conceive that, if London were ca&s;t (as Paris) into an or|bicular Form, the Circumference of it would be much larger than that of Paris. So much it is increa&s;ed in Buildings, &s;ince the di&s;mal Con|flagration in the Year 1666.</P>
<P>But whether it is profitable to the Body of the State or not, to have &s;o va&s;t a Head, may be made a Que&s;tion. And, if Dr. <HI>Heylin</HI> had cau&s;e to complain in his time of its being grown then too big for the Kingdom, he might with much more rea&s;on do it now. Great Towns, &s;ays he, in the Body of a State are like the Spleen or Milt in the Bo|dy natural. The mon&s;trous Growth of which

<P>The&s;e are all, I confe&s;s, very plau&s;ible Ar|guments.

On the other &s;ide, <HI>London</HI> having the Conveni|ency of the Sea and of a navigable River, is &s;o much the le&s;s &s;ubject to a Famine; for that in ca&s;e of Scarcity at home, it may be &s;upply'd from abroad. And, as in &s;o great a Body there be commonly different Parties led by oppo&s;ite Intere&s;ts, &s;o there is the le&s;s Cau&s;e to fear In&s;urrections, becau&s;e one Par|ty keeps &s;till another in aw. Ju&s;t &s;o <HI>Geneva</HI> and <HI>Hamburg,</HI> two free Cities, do not &s;ub|&s;i&s;t &s;o much by their own Strength, as by the Jealou&s;y of the &s;everal States that neigh|bour upon 'em.</P>
<PB N="283" REF="164">
<P>But the greate&s;t Danger incident to great Cities (and omitted by Dr. <HI>Heylin</HI>) is in Ca&s;e of Contagious Di&s;ea&s;es; Which, the more Matter they find to work upon, make &s;o much the greater havock; and like a ra|ging Fire, get &s;trength by their Motion. Witne&s;s the Year 1665, when at <HI>London</HI> there died of the Plague in one day no le&s;s than 1200.</P>
<P>When all is done, I have this to urge in the behalf of great Cities, that they are a vi&s;ible Sign of a flouri&s;hing State, and &s;uch as draws Re&s;pect from its Neighbours, who look upon it as the Luxuriancy and Re&s;ult of its Wealth. And, of all the Cities of Eu|rope, none can &s;o ju&s;tly challenge the Pre|eminency in this Point as <HI>London,</HI> the Metropo|lis of England; being not only perhaps the mo&s;t ancient, but al&s;o the wealthie&s;t, and (reckoning all its Annexes) the greate&s;t City now extant in Europe.</P>
<P>Such a City as contains above 600 Streets, Lanes, Courts, and Alleys; and in them all, by a late Computation, at lea&s;t a hundred thou&s;and Hou&s;es. So that, allowing only 8 Per&s;ons to each Hou&s;e one with another, (which I think is moderate) the Number of the Inhabitants will amount at that rate to above eight hundred thou&s;and Souls. Be|fides a World of Seamen, that live and &s;warm in that con&s;tant (tho' moving) Fore&s;t of Ships down the River, on the Ea&s;t &s;ide of the Bridge.</P>
<P>The Dwelling Hou&s;es rai&s;ed &s;ince the Fire are generally very fair, and built much more convenient and uniform than heretofore. Be|fore the Fire, they were mo&s;t Timber Hou|&s;es, built with little regard to Uniformity;
<PB N="284" REF="165">but &s;ince the Fire, Building of Bricks has been the general Way, and that with &s;o much Art and Skill in Architecture, that I have often wondered to &s;ee in well-compact Hou&s;es &s;o many Conveniences in a &s;mall com|pa&s;s of Ground. In &s;hort, our Engli&s;h Build|ers have built &s;o much of late Years, that no Nation perhaps at this time can vy with them for making much of any Ground (tho' never &s;o little) and contriving all the Parts of it to the be&s;t advantage, in the neate&s;t and mo&s;t regular way, with all the Conveni|ences the Ground can po&s;&s;ibly afford. And that which adds much to the Neatne&s;s of the late Buildings is the Wain&s;cot, now &s;o much in u&s;e. Which, as it is the cleane&s;t Furniture, &s;o it is the mo&s;t durable, and indeed the mo&s;t proper for &s;o moi&s;t a Country.</P>
<P>If we come to Stateline&s;s, I confe&s;s the Noblemens Hou&s;es at Paris, being built of free Stone (as mo&s;t of that City are) with large Courts before 'em for the Reception of Coaches, make a fine outward Appearance. But, for uniformity, &s;tate, and magnificence, we have &s;ome here, and chiefly <HI>Montague-Hou&s;e,</HI> that exceed by far mo&s;t of 'em. As for great Merchants Hou&s;es, and fair Taverns, &s;carce any City &s;urpa&s;&s;eth London in this particu|lar. For publick Buildings, as Halls, Inns of Court, Exchanges, Market-Places, Ho&s;pitals, Colledges, Churches, be&s;ides the Bridge upon the River, the Monument, Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e, and the Tower, they are Things worth any Stran|gers Curio&s;ity to view, at lea&s;t a good part of them. Mo&s;t of which have indeed the di&s;ad|vantage of being built backward, and out of the way, to make room for Trade&s;mens Shops in the Streets. Whereas, if they had
<PB N="285" REF="165">been all built towards the Street, as generally they are in other Countries, few Cities could make &s;o great an Appearance.</P>
<P>But for &s;tately, &s;trait, and &s;pacious Streets, (to pa&s;s by many curious Courts) where &s;hall one &s;ee finer than <HI>Cheap&s;ide, Cornhill, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ombard-Street, Fleet-Street, Hatton Garden, Pall|nall,</HI> and &s;everal others, e&s;pecially near the Court?

<P>La&s;tly, when I reflect upon that di&s;inal Fire, which in three Days time con&s;umed a|bove thirteen thou&s;and Hou&s;es (be&s;ides 89 Pari&s;h Churches, the va&s;t Cathedral of S. Paul, divers Chappels, Halls, Colledges, Schools, and other publick Edifices) it is a matter of amazement to me to &s;ee how &s;oon the Engli&s;h recovered them&s;elves from &s;o great a De&s;ola|tion, and a Lo&s;s not to be computed. At 3 Years end near upon ten thou&s;and Hou&s;es were rai&s;ed up again from their A&s;hes, with great Improvements. And by that time the fit of Building grew &s;o &s;trong, that, be&s;ides a full and glorious Re&s;tauration of a City that a raging Fire had lately buried in its A&s;hes, the Suburbs have been increa&s;ed to that de|gree, that (to &s;peak mode&s;tly) as many more Hou&s;es have been added to it, with all the Advantages that able and skilfull Builders could invent, both for Conveniency and Beau|ty.</P>
<PB N="286" REF="166">
<P>But it is time to come to Particulars The City, properly &s;o called, is begirt with a <HI>Wall,</HI> which gives entrance at &s;even prin|cipal <HI>Gates,</HI> be&s;ides <HI>Posterns</HI> of later erection Viz. on the We&s;t-&s;ide <HI>Ludgate</HI> and <HI>Newgate,</HI> both which &s;erve for Pri&s;ons; the fir&s;t, for &s;uch Debtors as are Freemen of the City the other for Malefactors both of the City and Country, and is be&s;ides the County Goa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for Debt.

<P>Within the Compa&s;s of the Walls there are reckoned 97 Pari&s;hes; and in relation to the Civil Government, the City within the Walls and Freedom is divided into 26 Wards or Aldermanries, of which more hereaf|ter.</P>
<P>As to the publick Buildings here, I &s;hall begin with the <HI>Tower,</HI> a Fort upon the Thames, which commands both the City and River. Called the Tower, from the great white Tower in the middle, which gives Name to the Whole. 'Tis all &s;urrounded with a Wall and Ditch about a mile in compa&s;s, with Cannon planted on the Walls, and the Tur|rets thereof. But it is be&s;ides the principal Store-hou&s;e of England for Arms and Ammu|nition, &s;uch as is &s;aid to contain Arms for about 60000 Men.</P>
<P>Here are al&s;o kept the Jewels and Orna|ments of the Crown, and the ancient Re|cords of the Nation. As among others, the Original of all the Laws that have been enacted or recorded till the Reign of Richard II. The Grants of &s;everal Kings to their Subjects at home and abroad, and

The Homage and De|pendency of Scotland upon England. The E&s;ta|bli&s;hment of Ireland in Laws and Dominions. The&s;e, and many other Records, are repo&s;ited in <HI>Wakefield Tower,</HI> near the Traytors Gate, under the Cu&s;tody of an Officer, called the <HI>Keeper of the Records,</HI> and who&s;e Salary is 500 <HI><ABBR>l.</ABBR> per Annum.</HI> This Place is properly in the Ma&s;ter of the Rolls his Gift.</P>
<P>Every day of the Week (except Sundays, Holy-Days, publick Fa&s;ting, and Thank&s;giv|ing-Days, and Times of great Pe&s;tilence) they that have occa&s;ion to look into the Re|cords have admittance.

Who&s;e Train-bands, making two intire Regiments of Foot, and above 3000 Men, are to attend the Kings Per&s;on when commanded, but are to march no farther than the King. They were &s;ometimes the Gards of the Tower, and are bound (if occa&s;ion be) to reinforce the Garri&s;on, upon the Con&s;table's Com|mand. Who, by his Place is to be in the Commi&s;&s;ion of the Peace for the City of London, and the Counties of Middle&s;ex, Kent, and Surrey. And &s;o is the <HI>Lieutenant,</HI> who is &s;ubordinate, to the Con&s;table for the time being, but in his ab&s;ence commands with the full Power of both. His Salary is 200 <HI><ABBR>l.</ABBR> per annum,</HI> with all the Fees and Perqui&s;ites, which are very con&s;iderable, both from the Pri&s;oners that happen to be in the Tower, and from the Warders Places, which are all at his Di&s;po&s;al.</P>
<PB N="289" REF="167">
<P>Under the Command of the Con&s;table, and the Lieutenant of the Tower in his ab&s;ence, are the <HI>Gentleman Porter,</HI> the 24 <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eomen Warders,</HI> and the <HI>Gunners of the Tow|er.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Gentleman Porter</HI> (who holds his Place by Patent) has the Charge of the Gates.

<P>The <HI>Warders</HI> are accounted the King's Do|me&s;tick Servants, and &s;worn accordingly by the Lord High Chamberlain, or by the Clerk of the Check. Their Duty is to wait at the Gates, and by the Lieutenant of the Tower's appointment to attend Pri&s;oners of State, which is the mo&s;t profitable and be|neficial part of their Station. At the Gates they examine every Stranger that offers to go in, and before admittance (according to the Rules of Military Di&s;cipline) tho&s;e that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ear Swords mu&s;t leave 'em in their hands, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ill they go out.

Paul's &s;hould be Rebuilt from their Foundations, with all Magnificence; That Bridges, Gates, and Pri&s;ons &s;hould be new made, the Sewers clean&s;ed, the Streets made &s;trait and regular, &s;uch as were &s;teep le|velled, and tho&s;e too narrow made wider; Markets and Shambles removed to &s;epa|rate Places. They al&s;o Enacted, that eve|ry Hou&s;e &s;hould be built with Party Walls, and all in Front rai&s;ed of equal height, and tho&s;e Walls all of &s;quare Stone or Brick, and that no man &s;hould delay Building be|yond the &s;pace of &s;even Years. Moreover, Care was taken by Law, to prevent all Suits about their Bounds. Al&s;o anniver|&s;ary Prayers were injoyned; and, to per|petuate the Memory hereof to Po&s;terity, they cau&s;ed this Column to be erected. The Work was carried on with diligence, and London is re&s;tored; but, whether with greater &s;peed or beauty, may be made a que&s;tion. At three years time the World &s;ees that fini&s;hed, which was &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Bu&s;ine&s;s of an Age.</Q>
<P>From the Monument I come now to the <HI>Royal Exchange,</HI> the fine&s;t Building of this kind in Europe. Fir&s;t erected in the year
<PB N="296" REF="171">1566 (ju&s;t one hundred years before it was burnt) at the Co&s;t and Chargers of a no|ble Merchant, Sir <HI>Thomas Gre&s;ham;</HI> and, by the &s;pecial Command of Queen Elizabeth, proclaimed in a &s;olemn manner by the Name of the <HI>Royal-Exchange.</HI> But then it was built mo&s;t of Brick; and now all of free-&s;tone within and without, with admirable Archi|tecture.</P>
<P>The &s;ame is Quadrangular, with a &s;tately Front to it, and a high Turret at the top, with a Chime of 12 Bells. Within is a large Court, wherein the Merchants meet daily about one a Clock; and all round it fine arched Galleries or Walks, for a Shelter in ca&s;e of Rain, or hot Sun-&s;hiny Wea|ther.</P>
<P>In the middle of the Court &s;tands a fine Statue of white Marble, upon a Pede&s;tal 7 foot high. 'Tis the Statue of King Charles II, done with great beauty and &s;pirit in the ancient Habit of the Roman Cae&s;ars, with a Wreath of Laurel on his Head. The Work of Mr. <HI>Gibbons,</HI> (a mo&s;t skilfull Arti&s;t,) at the charge of the Merchant Adventurers of England.</P>
<P>But the greate&s;t Ornament of this Place is in the Niches above, where the Kings of England from William the Conquerour are now partly &s;et up, till the re&s;t can be fini&s;h|ed.</P>
<P>Above Stairs is the Exchange, chiefly for wearing Apparel. It con&s;i&s;ts of almo&s;t 200 Shops, where the riche&s;t &s;ort of Commodi|ties are &s;old, both for U&s;e and Orna|ment.</P>
<P>The whole Fabrick co&s;t above 50000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> whereof one half being disbur&s;ed by the Chamber of London, and the other by the
<PB N="297" REF="171">Company of Mercers, they now reimbur&s;e them&s;elves by the Rent of the Shops above and below Stairs, and the vaulted Cellars un|der Ground. Which comes to about 4000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> a Year, be&s;ides 30 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> Fine, which is paid for every Shop. And, as Dr. <HI>Chamberlain</HI> ob|&s;erves, this goodly Fabrick not taking up quite an Acre of Ground, is perhaps the riche&s;t piece of Ground in the whole World.</P>
<P>In our Way towards We&s;tmin&s;ter, before we come to St. Pauls Cathedral, are three Things worth taking notice of. On the left hand, a <HI>Statute</HI> of King Charles II. on Hor&s;e|back in Stock-Market, with a fine Con|duit to it, <HI>Bow &s;teeple</HI> in the middle of Cheap&s;ide, and on the right hand the <HI>Guild|hall.</HI> The fir&s;t done in white Marble, at the Co&s;t and Charges of Sir Robert Viner. The other a &s;olid and beautifull Structure, compo&s;ed of four of the Orders of Building, which &s;hews the rare Invention of the Ar|chitect. The whole Height of it from the Ground is 225 foot, and yet is but half &s;o high as the intended Dome of St. Pauls Ca|thedral is de&s;igned to be. Noted be&s;ides for its Ring of Bells, reputed to be the be&s;t in all England. <HI>Guildhall,</HI> where the the City Courts of Judicature are held; and where the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common-Council meet for the Management of the City-Concerns, is a &s;pacious Building, but more glorious within than without. At the fir&s;t coming in is a &s;pacious Hall, &s;et out (among other Things) with the Pictures of Their Maje&s;ties King William and Queen Mary, with tho&s;e of &s;everal Judges. Here are al&s;o two Giauts, that &s;tand up in their bulky Figures.</P>
<PB N="298" REF="172">
<P><HI>Blackwell-Hall</HI> is &s;o near this Place, and &s;o famous for the Sale of Woollen-Cloths, that I cannot pa&s;s it by in Silence. The &s;ame was purcha&s;ed by the Lord Mayor and Com|monalty in the Beign of Richard II, and has been &s;ince imployed as a Weekly Market-Place for all &s;orts of Woollen-Cloth, broad and narrow, brought from all Parts of the Kingdom there to be &s;old. And it is to this day the greate&s;t Market and Store-hou&s;e for all &s;orts of Woolen-Cloth.</P>
<P>And now we come to St. <HI>Pauls Cathedral,</HI> &s;eated on the highe&s;t Part of all the City, and fir&s;t built by Sebert, the fir&s;t Chri&s;tian King of the Ea&s;t-Saxons. Before the Fire it was in Length 690 Foot, that is 20 foot long|er than St. Peter's in Rome, which for beauty, proportion, and divers other Things, excels all other Churches. Its Breadth and Height were proportionable to the Length, &s;o that it &s;tood upon &s;o much ground as contained above 3 Acres and a half. This famous Church, as va&s;t and &s;olid as it was, was devoured by that dreadfull Fire in the Year 1666. But, &s;ome Years after, Sir <HI>Chri|&s;topher Wren</HI> having, by the King's Command, de&s;igned a new Model of it, a new Foun|dation was laid accordingly. And, ever &s;ince, this &s;tately Fabrick has been carried on to that height we &s;ee it now. So that for Great|ne&s;s and Figure, for Solidity, Magnificence, and curious-Architecture, 'tis like to excel all Churches in Chri&s;tendom, except in &s;ome particulars St. Peter's Church in Rome. To this Cathedral belongs a Dean, and thirty Prebendaries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

Upon which he is admitted to one of the four Inns of Court, where he is fir&s;t called a Student, or Inner-Barri&s;ter, till after 7 Years Study he becomes a Mootman or Utter-Bar|ri&s;ter, and &s;ome Years after a Bencher.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e are Utter-Barri&s;ters, who from their Learning and Standing are called by the Benchers, in the Mooting Time, to plead and argue Moots, that is doubtfull Ca&s;es and Que&s;tions. And, whil&s;t they argue the &s;aid Ca&s;es, they &s;it uttermo&s;t on the Forms of the Benchers. Out of the&s;e Mootmen, are cho&s;en Readers for the Inns of Chancery, where in Term-Time and Grand Vacations they argue Ca&s;es in the pre&s;ence of Attor|neys and Clerks. In the four Inns of Chan|cery &s;eated in Holbourn, the Moots are read either by tho&s;e of Grays-Inn, or Lincolns-Inn; and in the others, by tho&s;e of the two Temples.</P>
<P>The Benchers, &s;o called from the Bench whereon they &s;it at the upper end of the Hall, are the Seniors, to whom is committed the Government of the whole Hou&s;e; and out of who&s;e Number is yearly cho&s;en a Trea|&s;urer, who receives, disbur&s;es, and accounts for all Moneys belonging to the Hou&s;e. Out of the&s;e are al&s;o cho&s;en tho&s;e Readers, who&s;e Reading is kept with &s;o much fea&s;ting and &s;o|lemnity. To which are invited the chief Nobles, Judges, Bi&s;hops, great Officers of the King|dom, and &s;ometimes the King him&s;elf. Such a Fea&s;ting as has co&s;t &s;ome Readers 1000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> After which the Reader wears a long Rob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|different
<PB N="305" REF="173">from other Barri&s;ters, and is then in a capacity to be made a Sergeant at Law, the Sergeants being u&s;ually cho&s;en out of the&s;e Readers.</P>
<P>The Manner of their Choice is thus. When the Number of Sergeants is &s;mall, the Lord Chief-Ju&s;tice of the Common Pleas, by the advice and con&s;ent of the other Judges, makes choice of &s;ome of the mo&s;t grave and learned of the Inns of Court, and pre&s;ents their Names to the Lord Chancellour, or Lord Keeper. Who &s;ends, by the King's Writ, to each of them, to appear on &s;uch a day be|fore the King, to receive the State and De|gree of a Sergeant at Law. At the appoint|ed Time, they, being habited in party|coloured Robes, come to We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall, accompany'd with the Students of the Inns of Court, and attended by a Train of Ser|vants and Retainers in their Cloth Liveries. Where they take in publick a &s;olemn Oath, and are cloathed with Coifs, which they wear always in publick. After this, they fea&s;t the great Per&s;ons of the Nation in a mo&s;t &s;plendid manner, and pre&s;ent them with gold Rings, according to their Quality. Out of the&s;e Sergeants the King calls by Writ &s;ome of them to be of his Council at Law. The&s;e fit within the Bar in all Courts at We&s;t|min&s;ter, except in the Common-Pleas.</P>
<P>The <HI>Inns of Court</HI> are &s;o called, either be|cau&s;e the Students therein are to &s;erve the Courts of Judicature, or elfe (as <HI>Forte&s;cue</HI> affirms) becau&s;e the&s;e Colledges received only the Sons of Noblemen and better &s;ort of Gentlemen. They are the large&s;t and the mo&s;t beautiful Inns; <HI>Grays-Inn</HI> particularly being beautify'd of late with a fine Square,
<PB N="306" REF="174">and another being now building in <HI>Lincolns-Inn,</HI> which will be a great Set-off and Orna|ment to it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Two Temples</HI> (heretofore the Dwell|ing of the Knights Templers, purcha&s;ed above 300 years &s;ince by &s;ome Profe&s;&s;ors of the Common Law) are called the <HI>Inner</HI> and <HI>Middle Temple,</HI> in relation to E&s;&s;ex-Hou&s;e, now built up into Streets. Which Hou&s;e was part of the Knights Templers, and called the <HI>Outer-Temple,</HI> becau&s;e &s;eated without Temple-Bar.</P>
<P><HI>Lincolns Inn</HI> is &s;o called from the ancient Earls of Lincoln, who&s;e Hou&s;e it was; and <HI>Grays-Inn,</HI> from the noble Family of the Grays, to whom it formerly belonged.</P>
<P>In the&s;e four Inns of Court are reckoned about 800 Students.</P>
<P>The <HI>Inns of Chancery</HI> were heretofore pre|paratory Colledges for younger Students; where they were u&s;ually entred, before they could be admitted into the Inns of Court. Now they are for the mo&s;t part taken up by Attorneys, Sollicitors, and Clerks; who have here their Chambers apart, and their Diet at an ea&s;y rate. Here they eat in a Hall to|gether, where they are obliged to appear in their Robes, and black round knit Caps.</P>
<P>The&s;e Inns belong to the Inns of Court, &s;ome to one, &s;ome to another. As <HI>Bernard's</HI> and <HI>Staple-Inns</HI> to Grays Inn, <HI>Thavies</HI> and <HI>Furnival's</HI> to Lincolns-Inn, and the re&s;t to the two Temples. Accordingly the Inns of Court &s;end yearly &s;ome of their Barri&s;ters to Read in tho&s;e Colledges, all which one with another contain about 500 Lawyers.</P>

<P>But, be&s;ides tho&s;e 8 Inns of Chancery, there is another in Chancery-Lane, known by the Name of <HI>Symonds Inn,</HI> being formerly a publick Inn kept by one <HI>Symond.</HI> This is an Inn by it &s;elf, belonging to no Inn of Court, nor liv|ing under any Rules, &s;uch as the other Inns live under.</P>
<P>Now 'tis to be ob&s;erved, that the fore&s;aid Societies are no Corporations, and have no Judicial Power over their Members. Only they have among them&s;elves certain Orders, which by Con&s;ent have the force of Laws. Neither have they any Lands or Revenues, as Societies; and, for the defraying the Charges of the Hou&s;e, they have but what is paid at Admittances, and Quit-rents for their Cham|bers. At the Colledge-Chappel, or Hall, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll Courts of Judicature, they wear a black Robe and Cap; at other times they walk in Gentlemens Habit. For light Offences they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re only Excommoned, and not to eat with the re&s;t. For great Offences they lo&s;e their Chambers, and are expelled the Colledge; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd, being once expelled, they are never received by any of the three other Socie|ties.</P>

<P>But London being in a manner an Univer|&s;ity, there are in it &s;everal other Colledges worth our taking notice.</P>
<P>I begin with the <HI>Colledge of Phy&s;icians,</HI> which &s;tood formerly in Knight-Rider Street; and was the Gift of Dr. <HI>Linacre,</HI> Phy&s;ician to King Henry VIII. Since which a Hou&s;e and Ground was purcha&s;ed by the Society of Phy|&s;icians at the end of Amen-Street, whereon a &s;tately Structure for a Library and a public<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Hall was erected by Dr. <HI>Harvey,</HI> Anno 1652. who indowed the &s;ame with his whole In|heritance, which he re&s;igned while he wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> yet living and in health. But this goodly Edifice could not e&s;cape the rage of the gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Fire. And that Ground being but a Lea&s;e
<PB N="309" REF="175">the Society purcha&s;ed a Piece of Ground in Warwick Lane near Newgate, whereon they have rai&s;ed the pre&s;ent Colledge, a magnifi|cent Edifice.</P>
<P>The Phy&s;icians of this Colledge have, by Charters and Acts of Parliament, &s;uch Pri|viledges as exclude all others (though Gra|duates in Phy&s;ick, of Oxford or Cambridge) from practi&s;ing Phy&s;ick in London, or with|in 7 miles of it, without a Licence under the Colledge-Seal. And all Offenders in that Ca&s;e, and divers others, they may fine, and impri&s;on. They have Authority to &s;earch all the Shops of Apothecaries in and about London, to &s;ee if their Drugs and Compo&s;iti|ons are whol&s;om and well made. And, by virtue of the &s;aid Charters, they are freed from all trouble&s;om Offices, as to &s;erve upon Juries, to be Con&s;table, to keep Watch and Ward, to bear Arms, or provide Arms or Am|munition, &amp;c.</P>
<P>This Colledge do's chiefly con&s;i&s;t of Fellows and Candidates; be&s;ides the honourary Fellows, and Licentiates. The Number of <HI>Fellows</HI> is always to be forty, be&s;ides the King's Phy&s;i|cians. And, when any Fellow dies, or leaves this City, the next Candidate &s;ucceeds to make up the Number. But the <HI>Candidates,</HI> before their Admi&s;&s;ion, are &s;trictly examined (or at lea&s;t ought to be &s;o) in all Parts of Phy&s;ick. The <HI>honourary Fellows</HI> and <HI>Licentiates</HI> do both injoy the Priviledges of the Colledge, but have no &s;hare in the Government.</P>
<P>The Title of <HI>Honourary</HI> was fir&s;t be&s;towed on &s;ome worthy Phy&s;icians who were un|willing or unable to come in by the right Line of Candidates. The <HI>Licentiates</HI> are &s;uch as for want of &s;ufficient Learning, &amp;c. are
<PB N="310" REF="176">judged unfit to be received into the Num|ber of Fellows or Candidates. Yet, becau&s;e they may be &s;erviceable to the Publick, and do good at lea&s;t in &s;ome &s;orts of Di&s;ea&s;es, they are, after due Examination and Appro|bation, licen&s;ed to practi&s;e.</P>
<P>Of this Colledge there is a Pre&s;ident, four Cen&s;ors, and eight Elects, who are all prin|cipal Members of the Society. Out of the&s;e one is cho&s;en every Year to pre&s;ide, and Michaelmas is the Time of Election. But, if the Pre&s;ident chance to die before, the elde&s;t Fellow has full power to execute his Place till the next Election. As for the Cen&s;ors, 'tis their province to look to and correct tho&s;e Interlopers that practi&s;e without Au|thority. Who&s;e Number in London is great, and yet connived at, according to the Rule, <HI>Si Populus vult decipi, decipiatur.</HI> But one would wonder there &s;hould be &s;o many, con&s;idering the Hazard both they and their Patients do run by their Practice. They by the Law of England, which makes it Felony in any one pre&s;uming to practi&s;e Phy&s;ick without Authority, who&s;e Patient dies under his hand.</P>
<P>The next Colledge of note is <HI>That of the Heralds,</HI> commonly called the <HI>Heralds Office,</HI> being upon S. Bennets Hill, near Doctors Commons. An ancient Hou&s;e, fir&s;t built by that Earl of Darby who married the Mother of Henry VII, and be&s;towed by Queen Mary on the Kings Heralds and Pur|&s;evants at Arms for ever. The greate&s;t Part of which is rebuilt &s;ince the great Fire, which laid it in A&s;hes.

<P>Within the Walls of London (in Bi&s;hops-Gate Street) is al&s;o &s;eated the Colledge call|ed <HI>Gre&s;ham Colledge,</HI> from his Founder Sir Thomas Gre&s;ham, who al&s;o built the Royal Exchange. After the Building whereof he gave one Moity of its Revenue to the May|or and Commonalty of London, and their Succe&s;&s;ors; the other Moiety, to the Com|pany of Mercers in tru&s;t, that the Mayor and Aldermen &s;hould find in all Time to come four able Per&s;ons to read within this Col|ledge Divinity, Geometry, A&s;tronomy, and Mu&s;ick, allowing each of them (be&s;ides their Lodgings) 50 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> a year; and that the Com|pany of Mercers &s;hould find three more able Men to read Civil Law, Phy&s;ick, and Rhe|torick, with the &s;ame Allowance as to the former.

<P>This Colledge is noted be&s;ides, for being the Meeting Place of that famous Society of Virtuo&s;o's called the <HI>Royal-Society;</HI> made a Cor|poration by virtue of a Charter King Charles II. granted them, bearing date the 22th of A|pril 1663. It con&s;i&s;ts of a Pre&s;ident, a Coun|til, and &s;everal Fellows; among which there is a Trea&s;urer, two Secretaries, and a Num|ber of Curators or Experimentors. Their Bu&s;ine&s;s is, by Experiments to promote the Knowledge of Natural Things, and u&s;efull Arts; which they have hitherto done in a great mea&s;ure. For, by the great Number of their Experiments and Inventions, they have mightily improved the Naval, Civil, and Military Architecture, but e&s;pecially the
<PB N="312" REF="177">Art of Navigation. They have al&s;o incon|raged Husbandry to that degree, that not on|ly England, but many other Countries, and even the remote&s;t of our foreign Plantations, feel the &s;weet effects of it. But, be&s;ides tho&s;e Experiments of Fruit and Profit, they have made many curious Di&s;coveries, &s;uch as the learned Lord <HI>Bacon</HI> calls Experiments of Light. And, if they have not an&s;wered to the full the Expectation of &s;ome People in point of U&s;efulne&s;s, they have at lea&s;t very indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly laid a &s;olid Ground-work for future Ages to improve Experimental Know|ledge.</P>
<P>Therefore King Charles gave them for their Coat of Arms a Scutcheon, with 3 Lyons of England in chief, intimating that the Society was Royal; for the Cre&s;t an Eagle, and for the Supporter hunting Hounds, to intimate the Sagacity imployed in penetra|ting and &s;earching after the Works of Na|ture.

<P>Their Meeting is upon Wedne&s;days, at 3 a Clock in the Afternoon. And the Office of the <HI>Pre&s;ident</HI> is to call and di&s;&s;olve the Meet|ings, to propo&s;e the Matter to be con&s;idered of, to put Que&s;tions, and call for Experi|ments, to admit the Members that from time to time &s;hall be elected, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The <HI>Trea&s;urer</HI> receives, and disbur&s;es all Moneys. The <HI>Se|cretaries</HI> read all Letters and Informations both from England and foreign Parts, directed to the Society, and make &s;uch Returns as the Society thinks fit. They take notice of the Orders and material Pa&s;&s;ages at the Meet|ings, &s;egi&s;ter all Experiments, all certain

<P>The Council con&s;i&s;ts of 21 Members, eleven whereof are to be continued for the next Year, and the other ten to be cho&s;en yearly upon the Fea&s;t of St. Andrew in the Mor|ning. After which they all dine together at a Veni&s;on-Fea&s;t.</P>
<P>The Manner of electing their <HI>Fellows</HI> is by Ballotting, according to the Venetian way. The Candidate is propo&s;ed at one A&s;|&s;embly by &s;ome that know him well, and the next he may be put to the Scrutiny. To carry it, he mu&s;t have the major Number of 21 Suffrages at the lea&s;t. And then at that, or the next A&s;&s;embly, he may be in|troduced, and &s;olemnly admitted by the Pre|&s;ident. At his Admi&s;&s;ion he &s;ub&s;cribes this Promi&s;e, <HI>That he will indeavour to promote the Good of the Royal Society of London, for the Improvement of Natural Knowledge;</HI> pays to the Trea&s;urer only 40 Shillings, and &s;o long as he continues a Member 13 Shillings a Quarter. But he may at any time free him|&s;elf from this Obligation, by &s;ignifying under his hand to the Pre&s;ident that he de&s;ires to withdraw from the Society.</P>
<P>Of this Society there have been all along, and are &s;till, Per&s;ons of the highe&s;t Rank, and many eminent Gentlemen and Doctors, both Engli&s;h and Foreiners, &s;ober, learned, &s;olid,
<PB N="314" REF="178">and ingenious Per&s;ons. Who, though of diffe|rent Degrees, Religions, Countries, Profe&s;&s;ions, Trades, and Fortunes; yet, laying a&s;ide all Names of Di&s;tinction, have united together, amicably to promote Experimental Know|ledge. Among which I cannot but make par|ticular mention of the Honourable Mr. <HI>Ro|bert Boyl,</HI> the Glory of England, and the O|racle of Europe in point of Philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>In this Colledge is the <HI>Repo&s;itory,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of many Rarities of Nature, &s;ome of 'em brought from the furthe&s;t Corners of the World. Such as Bea&s;ts, Birds, Fi&s;hes, Ser|pents, Flies, Shells, Feathers, Seeds, Minerals, Mummies, Gums, &s;ome things petrify'd, o|thers O&s;&s;ify'd, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Colledge I am to &s;peak of is another al&s;o within London, called <HI>Sion Colledge,</HI> near Cripplegate. Founded by <HI>Thomas White,</HI> Doctor in Divinity, for the U&s;e of the Cler|gy of London, and the Liberties thereof; and part for 20 poor People. To perform all which he gave 3000 <ABBR><HI>l</HI></ABBR>; and for the main|tenance of tho&s;e Poor, he &s;ettled 120 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> a year for ever. Be&s;ides 40 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> a year for a Sermon in Latine, at the beginning of every Quarter, and a plentifull Dinner for all the Clergy that &s;hall then meet there.</P>
<P>In this Colledge (now repaired, &s;ince the dreadfull Fire) is a fair &s;pacious Library, built by <HI>John Symp&s;on</HI> Rector of St. Olaves Heart-&s;treet, and one of the &s;aid Founder's Executors. Which Library, by the Bounty o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> divers Benefactors, has been well furni&s;hed with Books, e&s;pecially &s;uch as relate to Di|vinity.</P>
<PB N="315" REF="178">
<P>There are likewi&s;e in London divers <HI>Pub|lick Schools</HI> indowed, as <HI>St. Pauls, Merchant Taylors, Mercers Chappel,</HI> &amp;c. which in other Countries would be &s;tiled Colledges. But e|&s;pecially <HI>Paul's School,</HI> a commodious and &s;tate|ly Building at the Ea&s;t end of St. Paul's Ca. thedral. Founded in the Year 1512. by <HI>John Collet,</HI> Dr. of Divinity, and Dean of St. Pauls, for 153 Children to be taught there gratis. For which purpo&s;e he appointed a Ma&s;ter, a Sub-Ma&s;ter or U&s;her, and a Chaplain, with large Stipends for ever; committing the Over&s;ight thereof to the Ma|&s;ters, Wardens, and A&s;&s;i&s;tants of the Mercers in London, his Father <HI>Henry Collet</HI> (&s;ome|time Lord Mayor of London) having been of their Company.</P>
<P>Moreover, for the Correction of Vagabonds, and other Per&s;ons of a loo&s;e Life and Con|ver&s;ation, there are &s;everal <HI>Work-hou&s;es.</HI> The principal of which is <HI>Bridewell</HI> near Fleet-Bridge. A &s;tately Building, fir&s;t built by King Henry VIII. for the Reception of the Em|perour Charles the fifth, but &s;ince converted to this U&s;e. And, for Trying of Malefactors, there is in the Old-Baily the <HI>Se&s;&s;ions-Hou&s;e,</HI> which may go with the re&s;t among the Ornaments of this glorious City, as unplea|&s;ant as it is to many people that are there tried for their Lives.</P>
<P>Within the Precincts of We&s;tmin&s;ter are al&s;o many Things worthy our Ob&s;ervati|on.</P>
<P>I begin with <HI>Whitehall,</HI> belonging hereto|fore to Cardinal Wool&s;ey, and &s;ince his Time become the u&s;ual Place of Re&s;idence of the Engli&s;h Monarchs. 'Tis &s;eated betwixt the
<PB N="316" REF="179">Thames on the Ea&s;t and a fine Park on the We&s;t, amid&s;t the Plea&s;ures of the Water, and the Charms of a fine &s;pacious Spot of Ground. The River of one &s;ide affording a great deal of Variety by the Multitude of Boats that cover it; the Park on the other &s;ide charming the Eye with its delicate Walks, well gravelled and as well &s;hadowed, parted with a fine Canal in the middle, and this fronted with a brazen Statue, which for cu|rious Workman&s;hip is admired by Arti&s;ts them&s;elves.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Whitehall</HI> it &s;elf, I confe&s;s its out|ward Appearance is not great, but it is very convenient, and more glorious within than without. And yet the Chamber at the front of it, called the <HI>Banquetting-Hou&s;e,</HI> is &s;uch a Piece of Building as for Spaciou&s;ne&s;s, Beau|ty, Painting, and exact Proportion, is not to be parallelled by any King in Europe; the Cieling whereof was all painted by the hand of the famous Sir <HI>Peter Paul Rubens.</HI> Here is al&s;o, be&s;ides the Prote&s;tant Chappel, a neat one built by the late King James for his U&s;e, which by the Grace of God ly's now dormant. And in one of the Courts &s;tands his Brazen Statue, which has had bet|ter luck than that of Newca&s;tle upon Tine.</P>
<P>On the North-We&s;t &s;ide of the Park is an|other Royal Pallace, called <HI>St. James,</HI> which gives name to the Park. In the Strand is another Pallace, called <HI>Somer&s;et-Hou&s;e,</HI> where the Queen Dowager re&s;ides, and keeps her Dourt. This was built by Edward, Duke of Somer&s;et, Uncle to King Edward the fixth.</P>
<PB N="317" REF="179">
<P>But the Glory of We&s;tmin&s;ter is the <HI>Abbey-Church</HI> there, founded before the Norman Conque&s;t by King Edward the Confe&s;&s;our, and mo&s;t richly indowed; afterwards rebuilt from the Ground by King Henry III. This huge Fabrick &s;tands on that piece of Ground which formerly was called <HI>Thorney-I&s;land;</HI> then &s;ur|rounded with Water, and where of old &s;tood a Temple dedicated to Apollo. In this Church is u&s;ually performed the Coronation of our Kings, with that Pomp and Magni|ficence as becomes &s;uch potent Monarchs. On the Ea&s;t end of it is <HI>Henry the Sevenths Chappel,</HI> built by that King with admirable artificial Work both within and without. And here are the Tombs and Monuments of &s;everal of our Kings and Queens, among which that of ma&s;&s;y Bra&s;s is &s;o curiou&s;ly wrought, that it is &s;carcely to be parallelled.</P>
<P>The Abbey was converted into a Collegi|ate Church by Queen Elizabeth, who pla|ced therein a Dean, and 12 Prebendaries; be&s;ides about 30 petty Canons and others, belonging to the Quire. The Dean is in|tru&s;ted with the Cu&s;tody of the <HI>Regalia</HI> at the Coronation, and honoured with a Place of nece&s;&s;ary Service at all Coronations.</P>
<P>Adjoyning to this Church is a famous <HI>School</HI> and <HI>Colledge</HI> called <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter School,</HI> a Seminary for the Univer&s;ities. The Colledge con&s;i&s;ts of 40 Scholars, commonly called <HI>Kings Scholars;</HI> who, being cho&s;en out of the School, and put into the Colledge, are there maintained. And, as they are fitted for the Univer&s;ity, they are yearly elected away, and placed with good Allowances in Chri&s;t-Church Colledge in Oxford, and Trinity College in Cambridge.</P>
<PB N="318" REF="180">
<P>Here is al&s;o in the Cloy&s;ters a fair publick <HI>Library,</HI> free for all Strangers to &s;tudy both Morning and Afternoon always in Term|time.</P>
<P>Next this Church &s;tood the <HI>Royal Pallace</HI> of the Kings of England, a great Part where|of was burnt down in the Time of Henry VIII. What remained has &s;till been imploy'd for the U&s;e of the Lords and Commons a&s;|&s;embled in Parliament, and for the chief Courts of Judicature. The great Hall where the&s;e are kept, commonly called <HI>We&s;imin&s;ter-Hell,</HI> is 270 foot in length, and 74 in breadth, for its Dimen&s;ions not to be equalled by any Hall in Chri&s;tendom. And were it &s;et out according to its Greatne&s;s and the Dignity of the Courts that are kept there, it might pa&s;s for one of the mo&s;t remarkable Build|ings in Europe. Erected, as &s;ome &s;ay, by King William Rufus; or, according to others, by Richard II, about 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">0 years ago.</P>
<P>But this is not all that <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> affords wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h our taking notice. The <HI>Brazen Statue</HI> of King Charles I, at Charing-Cro&s;s, the <HI>New Exchange,</HI> and <HI>Exeter Change</HI> in the Strand, the <HI>Savoy</HI> once a famous Ho&s;pital, &s;everal <HI>Noblemens Hou&s;es</HI> more like Princely Pallaces (&s;uch as Montague, Berkley, Wall|ingford, Southampton, and Northumberland Hou&s;e) the <HI>New Buildings</HI> rai&s;ed from York, Arundel, Worce&s;ter, E&s;&s;ex, Newport, and Clarendon-Hou&s;e. Tho&s;e of <HI>Sohoe,</HI> which alone might make a good large City, and many more too numerous to in&s;i&s;t upon; All the&s;e, together with &s;o many fine <HI>Piazza's</HI> or <HI>Squares</HI> I have already mentioned, are enough (if
<PB N="319" REF="180">duly con&s;idered) to rai&s;e the Admiration of all Strangers.</P>
<P>But, for a publick Building of a late Erection, 'tis worth our while to &s;tep out of the Way, and take a View of <HI>Chel&s;ey-H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;pital.</HI> Begun by Charles II. continued by King James his Brother, and brought to perfection by our pre&s;ent King and Queen; for the Refuge and Maintenance of poor and di&s;abled Souldiers that have faithfully &s;erved their King and Country. A &s;tately Pile, which in &s;ome re&s;pects outdo's, in others is out done by the famous <HI>Hotel des Invalides</HI> at Pa|ris.</P>
<P>As for the Government of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter, the City of London, with the Liberties thereof, is governed in chief as to Civil Affairs, by a <HI>MAYOR,</HI> with the Title of <HI>Lord</HI> prefixt, given to no Mayor in England but that of London, and of late to the Mayor of York. In the Time of the Romans, he was called <HI>Prefect of London;</HI> in the Saxons time, <HI>Port-greeve,</HI> and &s;ometimes <HI>Provo&s;t of London;</HI> and, after the Coming in of the Normans, <HI>Bayliff.</HI> 'Twas King Richard I, who in the Year 1189 (being the fir&s;t of his Reign) changed the Name of Bayliff into that of <HI>Mayor,</HI> a French Word originally; which has continued ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>This great and mighty Magi&s;trate is yearly cho&s;en by the Citizens, upon Michaelmas Day, the 29th of September. The Body out of which he is cho&s;en are the 26 <HI>Aldermen,</HI> all Per&s;ons of great Wealth and Wi&s;dom, at lea&s;t ought &s;o to be. Tho&s;e that chu&s;e him are fir&s;t the <HI>Livory-men,</HI> or Members of the &s;everal Companies of Trade&s;men within the City,
<PB N="320" REF="181">and at la&s;t the Aldermen; which is done in this manner. Fir&s;t, the Livery-Men do u&s;u|ally put up four Candidates, out of which they chu&s;e two by the Plurality of Voices; and, out of the&s;e two, the Court of Alder|men &s;elect whom they think fit. And, though they be free in their Choice, yet commonly they have a regard for the Senior Alderman that has not been Lord Mayor, and give him the Precedence.</P>
<P>The Mayor Elect being Proclaimed, is &s;worn fir&s;t at Guildhall, and afterwards at We&s;tmin|&s;ter. There he &s;wears to maintain the Pri|viledges of the People; and here, to be True to the King.</P>
<P>The In&s;tallation-Day is the 29th of October, a Month after the Election. The Solemnity of which Day upon his Account is &s;o great, that no Magi&s;trate in Europe appears with &s;o much &s;tate and grandure as the Mayor of London upon his In&s;tallation. Fir&s;t, he go's by water to We&s;tmin&s;ter in his Barge of &s;tate, accompanied with the Aldermen in all their Formalities, with their Scarlet Robes and Chains of gold hanging before their Brea&s;ts. The Twelve Companies al&s;o, in their &s;everal Barges, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">et out with their Arms, Colours, and Screamers on both &s;ides, attend him in their furred Gowns. In his way he is &s;aluted from the Shore with the noi&s;e of great Guns; and, as he pa&s;&s;es by Whitehall, the King from thence viewing the Solemnity gives him and his Brethren a Mark of his Re&s;pect. At la&s;t being landed at We&s;tmin&s;ter Bridge, the &s;eve|ral Companies march in order to their Hall, and after them the Mayor and Aldermen, with the Sword and Mace before them, the Sword|bearer with his Cap of Maintenance on his
<PB N="321" REF="181">head. At their Entrance into the Hall, the Hall is Intertained with the harmonious Mu|&s;ick of a Set of Hoboys, marching in order before them, and playing all the Way. Fir&s;t they walk round the Hall, where they pay their re&s;pects to each Court of Judicature; and from the Hall they proceed to the Exche|quer-Chamber, where the New Lord Mayor is Sworn by the Barons. This done, they walk again in Proce&s;&s;ion round the Hall, to invite the &s;everal Judges of each Court to Dinner at Guildhall. And, after this, the whole Proce&s;&s;ion returns in the &s;ame man|ner by Water to Black-Friars. From whence the Lord Mayor and Aldermen make their Cavalcade to Guildhall, all mounted upon Hor&s;es richly Capari&s;oned; the Livery-Men marching before in good order. And now the <HI>Artillery men</HI> make their be&s;t appearance, with their Buff-coats and Head-pieces. But the mo&s;t diverting Sight is that of the <HI>Pageants,</HI> here and there in motion to divert the Spectators. At la&s;t a mo&s;t &s;plendid Din|ner, to which, be&s;ides the Judges, many of the great Lords and Ladies, the Privy Coun|&s;ellours, the forein Emba&s;&s;adors, and often|times the King and Queen are invited, con|cludes the Solemnity.</P>
<P>Such is the Magnificence of the Lord Mayor of London, though always a Citizen and Trade&s;man, being a Member of one of the 12 Companies. Who, for his great Dignity, is u&s;ually Knighted by the King, before the Year of his Mayoralty be expired; unle&s;s he had received that Honour before, whil&s;t he was an Alderman, as of late has been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|&s;hal.</P>
<PB N="322" REF="182">
<P>His Authority reaches, not only all over this great City and part of the Suburbs, (except &s;ome particular Places) but al&s;o on the Thames as far as the Mouth of it, and We&s;tward as far as Stanes-Bridge.</P>
<P>And &s;o great is his Power, that he may cau&s;e any Per&s;on inhabiting within London, or the Liberties thereof, to be Summoned to appear before him, upon the Complaint of any Citizen; and, for Non-appearance, may grant his Warrant to bring &s;uch Per&s;on before him. For he has Power to determine Differ|ences between Party and Party.</P>
<P>His Attendance, whil&s;t he is a Mayor, is very con&s;iderable. For, be&s;ides his proper Servants, fir&s;t he has four principal Officers that wait on him as Lord Mayor, who are reputed E&s;quires by their Places. And tho&s;e are the <HI>Sword-bearer,</HI> the <HI>Common Hunt,</HI> the <HI>Common Crier,</HI> and the <HI>Water-Bayliff;</HI> who&s;e Places are very advantageous, and purcha&s;ed (when vacant) at a great rate from the Lord Mayor for the time being. Be&s;ides them, there is the <HI>Coroner,</HI> 3 <HI>Sergeants Carvers,</HI> 3 <HI>Sergeants of the Chamber,</HI> 1 <HI>Sergeant of the Channel,</HI> 4 <HI>Yeomen of the Water&s;ide,</HI> 1 <HI>&V;nder Water-Bayliff,</HI> 2 <HI>Yeomen of the Chamber,</HI> 3 <HI>Meal|Weighers,</HI> 2 <HI>Yeomen of the Wood-Wharf,</HI> and &s;everal others. Mo&s;t of which have Servants allowed them, with Livories. Among which the <HI>Sword-bearer</HI> has a 1000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> a Year allow|ed him for his Table in the Lord Mayor's Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>When he appears abroad on hor&s;eback (which is his u&s;ual Appearance) 'tis with rich Capari&s;on, and always in long Robes, &s;ometimes of fine Scarlet-Cloth richly furred, &s;ometimes Purple, and &s;ometimes Puke, with
<PB N="323" REF="182">a black Velvet Hood over his Robes, and a great Chain of Gold (with a rich Jewel to it) hanging from his Neck downwards. At|tended by &s;everal Officers walking before, and on both &s;ides of him.</P>
<P>He keeps an open Table all the Year to all Comers of any quality; and &s;o well fur|ni&s;hed, that it is always fit to receive the greate&s;t Subject of England, or of any other Po|tentate. He has a Priviledge to hunt, not only in Middle&s;ex, but al&s;o in E&s;&s;ex and Sur|rey, and for this purpo&s;e has a Kennel of Hounds always maintained. On the King's Coronation-Day he claims to be the chief Butler, and bears the King's Cup among the highe&s;t Nobles of the Kingdom which &s;erve on that Day in other Offices. And, upon the King's Death, he is &s;aid to be the prime Per&s;on of England. Therefore, when King James I, was invited to come and take the Crown of England, <HI>Robert Lee,</HI> then May|or of London, &s;ub&s;cribed in the fir&s;t place, before all the Officers of the Crown, and all the Nobility.</P>
<P>One Thing is ob&s;ervable, which hapned not long &s;ince. I mean four Mayors the City had in little more than half a Year; viz. <HI>Sir John Shorter, Sir John Eyles, Sir John Chapman,</HI> and <HI>Sir Thomas Pilkington.</HI> For, upon the Death of the fir&s;t in September 1688, <HI>Sir John Eyles</HI> was made Lord Mayor; and in October fol|lowing, the Charter being re&s;tored, <HI>Sir John Chapman</HI> was cho&s;en Lord Mayor. Who dying in March following, <HI>Sir Thomas Pilkington</HI> was cho&s;en in his room. In who&s;e Per&s;on the Chance is turned almo&s;t quite contra|ry. For, if he do's outlive the Time appointed for his Mayoralty by his late
<PB N="324" REF="183">Re-election, in&s;tead of being Mayor but one Year, according to the u&s;ual Cour&s;e, his Mayoralty will reach near two Years and a half.</P>
<P>Next to the Lord Mayor there are

<P>The 26 Aldermen pre&s;ide over the 26 Wards of the City, a peculiar Alderman being a&s;|&s;igned to every Ward. Who has under him a certain Number of Common-Council-Men, and one of them his Deputy; be&s;ides Con&s;ta|bles, Scavengers, Beadles, &amp;c. Now the Aldermen who have been Lord Mayors, and the three elde&s;t Aldermen that have not yet arrived to that honourable e&s;tate, are by the City-Charter Ju&s;tices of Peace of the City. Upon the Death of an Alderman, the Lord Mayor i&s;&s;ues out his Precept to the Ward whereof he was Alderman, to chu&s;e two &s;ub&s;tantial Men of the City, and return their Names to the Court of Aldermen. Which being done, the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen &s;elect one of the two, &s;uch as they judge fitte&s;t for that Station.</P>
<P>The <HI>Recorder</HI> is u&s;ually a grave and learned Lawyer, well ver&s;ed in the Laws and Cu&s;toms of the City, and in that Capacity is an A&s;|&s;i&s;tant to the Lord Mayor. He takes his place in Councils, and in Court, before any Man that has not been Mayor; and 'tis he that de|livers the Sentences of the whole Court.</P>
<PB N="325" REF="183">
<P>The two <HI>Sheriffs</HI> of this City are al&s;o <HI>She|riffs</HI> of the County of Middle&s;ex. They are yearly cho&s;en in the Guildhall on Mid&s;ummer-Day, by the Livery-Men of the re&s;pective Companies, that is, by the Citizens from a|mong them&s;elves. A high Priviledge, con&s;i|dering the Importance of this Magi&s;tracy, e|&s;pecially in their power of Impanelling Juries. Yet my Lord Mayor by his Prerogative may drink to any Citizen, and nominate him to be one of the Sheriffs; In which Ca&s;e the U&s;age has been for the Commons to confirm &s;uch a Per&s;on, and to elect another to &s;erve with him. However, the new-cho&s;en Sheriffs are not &s;worn till Michaelmas Eve, and till then they do not enter upon their Office. If any of the Parties cho&s;en refu&s;e to hold, he in|ours a Penalty of 450 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> unle&s;s he do take his Oath, that he is not worth ten thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>Each <HI>Sheriff</HI> has under him an <HI>&V;nder-She|riff,</HI> and &s;ix <HI>Clerks,</HI> viz. a Secondary, a Clerk of the Papers, and four other Clerks. He has al&s;o a certain Number of <HI>Sergeants,</HI> and every Sergeant a <HI>Yeoman.</HI> The <HI>&V;nder-Sheriffs</HI> have al&s;o <HI>Clerks</HI> under them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chamberlain</HI> is an Officer of great Power in the City. For without him no man can &s;et up Shop, or follow his Trade without being &s;worn before him; neither can one be bound an Apprentice to any Trade&s;man, but by his Licence. He may Impri&s;on any that di&s;obey's his Summons, or anv Apprentice that mi&s;demeans him&s;elf, or el&s;e he may puni&s;h him in another man|ner.</P>

<P>Each Company (or My&s;tery) has a Ma&s;ter yearly cho&s;en from among them&s;elves; and other &s;ubordinate Governours, called War|dens, and A&s;&s;i&s;tants. Such is the Harmony of this Government, that the&s;e Companies do exactly corre&s;pond to the general Govern|ment of the City by a Lord Mayor and Com|mon Council, who are &s;elected out of the&s;e &s;everal Companies. For he that is cho&s;en Lord Mayor mu&s;t be free of one of the&s;e 12 Companies; and, if he be of any other Company, he pre&s;ently removes to one of the&s;e. Which have got &s;o great Credit and Reputation in the World, that &s;everal Kings have honoured &s;ome of them by taking their Freedom thereof. The pre&s;ent King was late|ly plea&s;ed to accept of the Freedom of the
<PB N="327" REF="184">Company of Grocers; pre&s;ented to Him in a golden Box in the Name of the City by Mr. <HI>Box;</HI> upon which he was Knighted by His Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, &s;uch are the Priviledges of the Citizens of London, that they are Toll-free throughout England. And the Lord Mayor u&s;ually, at the Reque&s;t of any Citizen that trades in remote Parts, grants him his War|rant or Certificate.</P>
<P>They have al&s;o the Priviledge to keep out all Artificers and Handicraft&s;men not free of the City. So that if a Freeman of London do imploy any &s;uch to work within the City or Liberties, he is liable to the Forfeiture of 5 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> a Day, and an Action lies again&s;t him for the &s;ame. An Alien indeed may be imploy'd &s;ix Weeks, but no longer. And how &s;evere &s;oever this may &s;eem to Foreiners, yet it is grounded upon Equity. For were it not for that Priviledge, here would be &s;uch a Con|cour&s;e of Foreiners, that it would prove (as it has by Experience) the utter undoing of a great Number of poor Citizens and Free|men, who&s;e Livelyhood depends upon their Handicrafts.</P>
<P>Another great Priviledge they have, is their &s;ending no le&s;s than four Members to Par|liament, which is twice the Number of other Cities and Borough-Towns in England. And it is ob&s;ervable, that their Members do u&s;u|ally appear in their Scarlet-Robes the fir&s;t Day the Parliament &s;its, when all other Mem|bers (except the Speaker of the Hou&s;e) ap|pear in their u&s;ual Habit.</P>
<PB N="328" REF="185">
<P>Thus the Lord Mayor of London, under the gracious Influences of the Engli&s;h Mo|narchs, makes a Figure more like a Prince than a Subject. And the Citizens of London, though under the &s;ame general Government as all the re&s;t of the Kings Subjects, yet live within them&s;elves, ble&s;t with &s;o many Advan|tages, that I can compare them no better than to the old Citizens of Rome under the be&s;t of their Emperours.</P>
<P>And indeed the main Thing which has in|couraged Trade here to that degree as to ren|der this Place &s;o rich and flouri&s;hing, is the great Charters, Priviledges, and Immunities it is inve&s;ted with, by the Munificence of &s;everal of the former Kings. Whereby the Londoners are Impowered to chu&s;e their own Magi&s;trates, to do them&s;elves Ju&s;tice, to main|tain their own Peace, and pur&s;ue all the good and advantagious Ends of Trade, with the better Succe&s;s and greater Security. In or|der to which they keep within them|&s;elves many Courts and Councils, where they make Laws for the better Govern|ment of the &s;everal Ranks and Orders of Men among them. And, though the&s;e grand Priviledges were judged to be for|feited by the Court of Kings Bench upon the <HI>Quo Warranto</HI> brought in at the latter end of Charles II his Reign, and a new Charter granted the City, but with &s;everal Re&s;trictions of great moment; yet that Judgement was Rever&s;ed upon their late Application to the Parliament, and their ancient Charter Con|firmed. So that Things run now, as they did before that Judgment, in their proper Channel.</P>
<PB N="329" REF="185">
<P>For Military Affairs, the City of <HI>London</HI> is a Lieutenancy of it &s;elf. So that the Power of a Lord Lieutenant is in the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, and other principal Members of the City, for the Time being. Who, by a peculiar Commi&s;&s;ion from His Ma|je&s;ty, are authorized to act as his Lieutenants in London, for the ordering the City-Mi|litia, with the &s;ame Power that the Lord Lieutenants have in their re&s;pective Coun|ties.</P>
<P>Now the City-Militia con&s;i&s;ts of 6 Regi|ments of Foot, making about 90000 men; be&s;ides the Hamlets of the Tower 2 Regiments, and the Regiment of Southwark. To which if we add the Militia of We&s;tmin&s;ter, con&s;i&s;t|ing of 2 Regiments, called Holborn and We&s;t|min&s;ter, each of 2000 men, we find in all eleven Regiments. But, in ca&s;e of Nece&s;&s;ity the Auxiliaries are rai&s;ed, con&s;i&s;ting of Ap|prentices, which make up &s;ix Regiments more; every Freeman that has two Apprentices find|ing one for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>To &s;upply the City Train-Bands and Auxiliary men with Commanders, there is a Nur&s;ery of Souldiers, called the <HI>Artillery Com|pany,</HI> of above 60 Years &s;tanding. This Company con&s;i&s;ts of 600 choice men, com|manded in chief by the King, and under his Maje&s;ty by a Leader. Who exerci&s;es this Company every Tue&s;day fortnight in the Artillery-Ground, a &s;pacious Place near Moorfields, inclo&s;ed for that purpo&s;e with a fair Brick-Wall. And the other Tue&s;day the Exerci&s;e is performed by the &s;everal Mem|bers of the Company, who are there trained up to command, mo&s;t of them being Com|manders of the Train-Bands. They have a
<PB N="330" REF="186">Court-Mar&s;hal, con&s;i&s;ting of a Pre&s;ident, Vice-Pre&s;ident, Colonel, and 24 Members of the Company. On the &s;econd Tue&s;day in February is their general Rendezvous every Year, when they chu&s;e their Officers. Which, be&s;ides the Leader, are two Lieutenants, 2 En&s;igns, 2 Sergeants, a Provo&s;t Mar&s;hal, 3 Gentlemen of Arms, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Church-Government is by the Bi&s;hop of London. The Pari&s;hes whereof, for the mo&s;t part provided with able and eminent Divines under the Title of Rector or Vicar, are under his Juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>And, for maintaining the&s;e Divines, with their Families, there is in mo&s;t Pari&s;hes a Par&s;onage, or Vicarage-Hou&s;e, with a yearly Allowance, be&s;ides the Perqui&s;ites ari&s;ing from Chri&s;tenings, Marriages, and Burials. Which Allowance, &s;ince the Reformation, falls much &s;hort of what it was in the time of Popery; when, be&s;ides the Tythes of the Trade&s;|mens Gains, the Mortuaries, Obits, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Prie&s;t (tho' in a &s;tate of Celibacy) had 3 &s;hillings and 5 pence in the pound of the yearly Rent of all the Hou&s;es and Shops in his Pari&s;h. Which afterwards was brought to 2 &s;hillings, 9 pence in the pound, by an Act of Parliament under the Reign of Hen|ry VIII, and that confirmed by a &s;ub&s;equent Act. But, &s;ince the Reformation, this being lookt upon as too large an Allowance, it has been &s;o curtailed, that 'twill be hard to bring back that golden Age. 'Tis true under the Reign of Charles II. a Regulation was made by Act of Parliament, but it concerned only tho&s;e Pari&s;hes, who&s;e Churches had been demo|li&s;hed by the dreadfull Fire. And, according
<PB N="331" REF="186">to the &s;everal Extents of Pari&s;hes, the Par|&s;ons thereof, by virtue of that Act, have a certain yearly Allowance, none under 100 Pounds, and none above 200; but mo&s;t be|tween one and two hundred Pounds. The &s;ame to be rai&s;ed, in lieu of Tythe, within the &s;aid re&s;pective Pari&s;hes, by rating the Hou|&s;es and Shops therein proportionably to their re&s;pective Rents. As to tho&s;e Pari&s;hes all over the City and Suburbs where there is, be&s;ides the Par&s;on, a Lecturer, he has his maintenance no otherwi&s;e than by a voluntary Contribution from the Pari&s;hio|ners.</P>
<P>As for the City of We&s;tmin&s;ter, the Dean and Chapter are inve&s;ted with all man|der of Juri&s;diction, both Civil and Eccle&s;ia|&s;tical; not only within the City of We&s;t|min&s;ter, but al&s;o in other Places of their Ju|ri&s;diction, as the Precincts of S. Martin le Grand within the Walls of London, and &s;ome Towns in E&s;&s;ex. The Dean in particular has a Commi&s;&s;ion of Peace within the City and Liberties of We&s;tmin&s;ter.</P>
<P>The principal Officer in it, called the High Steward of We&s;tmin&s;ter, is u&s;ually one of the prime Nobility. Under whom there is a De|puty Steward, then the Bayliff, and the two high Burge&s;&s;es, the&s;e cho&s;en every Year.</P>
<P>Within the Precincts of We&s;tmin&s;ter, but chiefly near the Court, the Nobility and Gen|try take up for the mo&s;t part their Quarters. But the proper Station of the Lawyers is in their Inns, between the City and the Court; and that of Merchants and Seamen, in and a|bout the Ea&s;t-end of the City.</P>
<PB N="332" REF="187">
<P>Thus you have a &s;hort De&s;cription of the famous City of London, the Metropolis of England, the Seat of the Briti&s;h Empire, the Epitome and Glory of this Kingdom. A City which for Greatne&s;s, Beauty, Conveni|encies, Plenty of Provi&s;ions, Commerce, Riches, and good Government, is inferiour to none beyond Sea. 'Tis a Magazine of all &s;orts of Commodities, nece&s;&s;ary or expedient for the U&s;e or Plea&s;ure of Mankind. The great Rendez-vous of the Nobility, Gentry, Cour|tiers, Divines, Lawyers, Phy&s;icians, Mer|chants, Seamen, of the be&s;t Artificers, the mo&s;t refined Wits, and the greate&s;t Beauties of the Land.</P>
<P>For a con&s;tant Supply of Provi&s;ions, here are abundance of <HI>Markets,</HI> the be&s;t furni&s;hed of any in Chri&s;tendom; but e&s;pecially <HI>Leaden-Hall-Market,</HI> near the Royal Exchange in the City, the greate&s;t Fle&s;h-Market about the City, and a great Magazine of Corn. So that there is &s;carce a great City in Europe, where poor People, or &s;uch as love a frugal Life, may live cheaper, or the &s;plendid Liver, gallanter.</P>
<P>To get a Livelyhood, and rai&s;e him&s;elf in the World, no Place like this; by Me|chanick or Liberal Arts, by Merchandizing, Offices, Preferments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>For Conveniencies and Delight, here all is at hand; and &s;carce any Thing wanting, that Money can purcha&s;e. In point of So|ciety, here learned and unlearned, high and low, rich and poor, good and bad, may fit them&s;elves any where.</P>
<P>And this I mu&s;t needs &s;ay to the Prai&s;e of <HI>London,</HI> that, there is not a Place in Eu|rope of &s;uch a va&s;t Confluence of all &s;orts of
<PB N="333" REF="187">People, where Murders and Outrages, &s;o fre|quent in great and populous Cities beyond Sea, are &s;o &s;eldom heard of. Which argues a great deal of Wi&s;dom in the Magi&s;trate, that &s;o great a Body &s;hould be kept in &s;o good Order.</P>
<P><HI>William the Conquerour,</HI> to prevent Di&s;orders and Mi&s;chiefs in the Night, commanded that in every Town and Village a Bell (called <HI>Curfew-Bell,</HI> a Corrupt Word from the French <HI>Couvre-feu</HI>) &s;hould be rung every Night at 8 of the Clock, and that all people &s;hould then put out their Fire and Candle. This continued in his Reign, and that of his next Succe&s;&s;or <HI>William Rufus.</HI> But <HI>Henry</HI> I. revoked that Order; and <HI>Henry</HI> III. Anno 1253. command|ed Watches to be kept in Cities and Boroughs, for the Pre&s;ervation of Peace and Quietne&s;s among his Subjects.</P>
<P>Therefore there are in the re&s;pective Streets of London to this day convenient Stations for the Watchmen; who are to examine all Per&s;ons walking in un&s;ea&s;onable Hours, and to &s;ecure till next Day &s;uch as are either &s;u&s;|picious or riotous. And then they bring them before a Ju&s;tice of Peace, who deals with them according to the Merit of the Cau&s;e. Thus Murders, Robberies, Felonies, Fires, and other Evils, are oftentimes pre|vented; which could not be avoided in &s;o great and populous a Place, where a great many wicked People ly lurking for Mi&s;chief. This Duty of Watching is commonly perform|ed by Men hired for that purpo&s;e, and paid for't by the Citizens, under the Command of a Con&s;table, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Eeadle of the Pari&s;h. In ca&s;e of a publick Riot, the King u&s;ually &s;ends a Party of his Gards to &s;up|pre&s;s
<PB N="334" REF="188">it; and, if occa&s;ion requires, part of the Militia is rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>But, to draw to a Conclu&s;ion, if we ca&s;t our Eyes upon the va&s;t Traffick and Com|merce, whereby this Place is become &s;o flou|ri&s;hing, it will every where afford matter of Admiration. The &s;ame does plainly appear by the Cu&s;toms yearly paid for all Merchan|di&s;e Imported and Exported, by the great Wealth of many Citizens, by the infinite Number of Shops both in the City and Su|burbs for the Retailing Trade, and la&s;tly by the incredible Abundance of Apprentices which are here brought up to all manner of Trades.</P>
<P>The Cu&s;toms for this City alone (tho' ve|ry moderate, in compari&s;on of mo&s;t other Places in Europe) did lately amount to near 400000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> a Year. The Wealth of the Citi|zens &s;o va&s;t, that &s;ome of 'em, for great E|&s;tates in Mony, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> excel &s;ome Princes be|yond Sea; and live accordingly in great &s;tate and plenty, few &s;o penuriou&s;ly as mo&s;t of the Dutch Merchants do. The Number of Shops both in the City and Suburbs &s;o great, and indeed &s;o far beyond that of any forei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> City, that it is to Strangers a ju&s;t Matter of Amazement. Proportionable to which is That of the Apprentices, reckoned to be at lea&s;t forty thou&s;and.</P>
<P>Now this great Trade of the Londoners runs into three &s;everal Streams, 1. among them|&s;elves, 2 in the Country, and 3 beyond Sea, of which in my &s;econd Part.</P>
<P>Only I &s;hall ob&s;erve here, that the va&s;t Trade of this Place has chiefly occa&s;ioned that great Appearance in it of <HI>Pictures in the
<PB N="335" REF="188">Air,</HI> a Thing taken particular notice of at the fir&s;t view by Strangers. I mean the Multi|tude of Signs which hang before the Hou&s;es; many of them very rich and co&s;tly, and all together yielding a fine Pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>But, on the other &s;ide, its frequent <HI>Dirt</HI> in Winter, and <HI>Du&s;t</HI> in Summer, are two &s;uch Nu&s;ances as take off very much from the Glory of it. And yet both of them might with ea&s;e be Remedied, and will (I hope) in time. For, in point of Cleanne&s;s, few Towns are better Seated than London is, &s;tanding upon an ea&s;y A&s;cent from the River. And the Allowance for it from each Hou&s;e|keeper is &s;o con&s;iderable, that one would think it enough to keep it cleaner than it is. But the Truth is, there's a &s;ort of <HI>Chy|mi&s;ts,</HI> that can extract Gold out of Dirt. And I conjecture the le&s;s Care has been ta|ken to take off that Reproach from &s;o noble a City, becau&s;e of the two great Conve|niences it has to go free from the Dirt from one End of it to the other, that is, by Land in Coaches, and by Water in Boats. Be&s;ides that the principal Streets, and mo&s;t of the New Buildings, are paved a good conveni|ent Breadth on each &s;ide with &s;mooth hewn Stone, for the benefit of Foot-Pa&s;&s;engers. Which is a great Commodiou&s;ne&s;s, as well as an Ornament.</P>
<P>I conclude, as to <HI>Loudon,</HI> with three no|table Conveniencies it has, not el&s;ewhere to be found; Viz. the <HI>New Lights,</HI> the <HI>Peny-Po&s;t,</HI> and the <HI>In&s;urance-Office for Hou&s;es in ca&s;e of</HI> Fire.</P>
<PB N="336" REF="189">
<P>The <HI>New Lights</HI> is &s;o ingenious and u&s;efull an Invention, that Mr. <HI>Edmund Heming</HI> the Inventor de&s;erves an immortal Prai&s;e for it. He brought it to light about 6 Years ago, with a Patent from King Charles II, for the Injoyment of the Profits thereof. And &s;uch is the Reflexion of the&s;e Lights, tho' at a good di&s;tance from each other, that few of them &s;erve to light a whole Street in the Night, better than ten times the Number of Gla&s;s Lanthorns. For, by the regular Po&s;ition of one of them before the Front of every tenth Hou&s;e on each &s;ide of a broad Street, there is &s;uch a mutual Re|flection, that they all &s;eem to be but one great &s;olar Light.</P>
<P>And &s;o cheap is this Conveniency, that for five Shillings down and five Shillings a Year for five Years, to be paid at two Quar|terly Payments, the Inventor obliges him&s;elf to light the Front of ones Hou&s;e from Mi|chaelmas to Lady Day every Night from &s;ix to twelve, beginning the third Night after every Full-Moon, and ending the &s;ixth Night after every New Moon, which is in all 120 Nights.</P>
<P>The <HI>Peny-Post</HI> is &s;uch a Contrivance, that for one Peny a Letter, or Parcel not ex|ceeding one pound Weight, or ten pounds in value, is pre&s;ently conveyed from all Parts of the Town and Suburbs to the remote&s;t Places thereof. And it has been &s;o far im|proved, &s;ince the fir&s;t &s;ettling of it, as to reath ten miles about London. He that &s;ends pays the Peny; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd, when the Letter or Parcel goes beyond the Bounds of the Weekly Bills of Mortality, the Receiver pays another Peny.</P>
<PB N="337" REF="189">
<P>To carry on this u&s;efull De&s;ign, fir&s;t there are about the Town four or five hundred Hou|&s;es to take in Letters and Parcels. And, to convey them according to their Directi|ons, there are about 100 me&s;&s;engers imploy|ed from Morning to Night, to call every Hour at the &s;aid Hou&s;es, and take what Let|ters and Parcels they find there. Who carry the &s;ame to their re&s;pective Offices, from whence the Letters and Parcels are di&s;patch|ed away according to their Directions. The Offices are &s;ix in Number; Viz.

<P>The whole Concern is managed in chief by three Per&s;ons, a <HI>Comptroller,</HI> an <HI>Accomptant,</HI> and a <HI>Receiver.</HI> Every one of the <HI>Me&s;&s;engers,</HI> imployed in the bringing in and carrying out of Letters, gives 50 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> Security by Bond to the Office for his Fidelity. And for this Contrivance the Publick is indebted to that ingenious Citizen of London, Mr. <HI>William Dockwrea,</HI> who &s;ettled it &s;ome Years &s;ince, not without much trouble and co&s;t. But the late King, when Duke of York, &s;ued him for the lame, as his Right, and carried it from the Inventor. So that the Benefit of it is now inherent in the Crown.</P>
<P>The <HI>In&s;urance Office for Hou&s;es in ca&s;e of Fire</HI> is al&s;o an Invention worth our taking notice. To In&s;ure, for example, 100 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> upon a Brick|hou&s;e,
<PB N="338" REF="190">the Rates are 6 Shillings for one Year, 12 for two Years, 18 for three Years; and double for a Timber-hou&s;e. But, if any In&s;ure for four Years, there is a Di&s;count allowed for paying down the Mony, &s;o that he pays but three Years and a Quarter; and propor|tionably five for &s;even, &s;even for eleven Years In&s;urance. And, as often as the Hou&s;e is Burnt, or Demoli&s;hed by rea&s;on of Fire, within the Term In&s;ured, the Mony In&s;ured on the Hou&s;e is to be paid; but, if only Damaged, then to be Repaired at the Charge of the Office. For the &s;ecurity of which Payment, the Office has a Fund to the Value of 60000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> in Ground-Rents of Inheritance (which is above 2600 <HI><ABBR>l.</ABBR> per annum</HI>) to an&s;wer Lo&s;|&s;es and Damages; and &s;ettled on Twelve Gentlemen Tru&s;tees, by many of the mo&s;t eminent Coun&s;el at Law.</P>
<P>This Ingenious and U&s;efull Invention was fir&s;t put into practice about 8 Years &s;ince, and has de&s;ervedly met with good Incourage|ment, in&s;omuch that there are now above 7300 Hou&s;es In&s;ured. The Office is kept on the Back-&s;ide of the Royal-Exchange, and at the Rainbow Coffee-hou&s;e by the Inner-Temple Gate in Fleet&s;treet.</P>

<P>That <HI>Oxford</HI> has been for many Ages a Place of publick Studies, is a Thing pa&s;t all doubt. But it is true withal, that there has been a Time of Decay; when this City &s;haring with the re&s;t of the Land in tho&s;e common Calamities brought by the Saxons and Danes, the Mu&s;es were di&s;per&s;ed, and &s;hifted for them&s;elves. <HI>Alfred,</HI> the learned Sa|ron King of England, was he that recalled them; who, having intirely &s;ubjected the irk|&s;om Danes to his Government, made it his bu&s;ine&s;s to re&s;tore this Univer&s;ity, and re|pair the Ruins thereof. And, the better to in|vite Students to Oxford, he &s;ent thither his Son <HI>Ethelward,</HI> which dr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> the young Nobles from all Parts to <HI>Oxford.</HI> This came to pa&s;s about the latter end of the ninth Cen|tury. Then <HI>Oxford</HI> began to flouri&s;h again, and by degrees to grow to what it is.</P>
<P>But, as now in <HI>Leyden</HI> and many other forein Univer&s;ities, &s;o anciently in Oxford the Students lived in Citizens Hou&s;es, having only Meeting Places to hear Lectures and Di&s;putations, and that without any di&s;tincti|on of Habit. After that, there were divers Hou&s;es (now called Halls) for Students only to live together in Society, as now the Inns of Court and of Chancery at London. A|mong&s;t which &s;ome afterwards Indowed by the bounty of divers Patrons of Learning; who thought be&s;t to &s;ettle for ever plenti|tiful Revenues in Lands and Hou&s;es, in order to maintain &s;uch Students as by merit and worth &s;hould from time to time be cho&s;en,

<P>Now, to make a particular De&s;cription of tho&s;e &s;tately Colledges, their Halls, Chappels, and Libraries, their excellent Accommodation for young Noblemen and Gentlemen, their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arge Revenues, great Salaries for publick Profe&s;&s;ors, and Allowances for poor Scholars, &amp;c. would require another Volume. But this I mu&s;t &s;ay of the <HI>Bodlean Library,</HI> a no|table
<PB N="344" REF="193">light&s;om Fabrick, that for Number of choice Books, rare Manu&s;cripts, diver&s;ity of Languages, liberty of &s;tudying, and facility of finding any Book, it &s;carce falls &s;hort of the famous Vatican. The New <HI>Theatre,</HI> built for Schola&s;tick Exerci&s;es by Dr. <HI>Sheldon,</HI> the late mo&s;t Reverend Archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury, is &s;o curious a Piece of Architecture, that it were a Tre&s;pa&s;s not to take notice of it. And the publick <HI>Phy&s;ick Garden,</HI> &s;ur|rounded with &s;tately Stone-Walls, and abound|ing with Variety of choice Plants, is &s;o de|lightful a Place, that I could not do le&s;s than mention it.</P>
<P>But the lately erected <HI>Mu&s;aeum,</HI> fini&s;hed in the Year 1683, de&s;erves a brief Account. 'Tis a large and &s;tately Pile of &s;quared Stone, built at the Charge of the Univer&s;ity, and de&s;igned not only to advance the Studies of true and real Philo&s;ophy, but al&s;o to conduce to the U&s;es of Life, and the Improvement of Phy&s;ick. This Building borders upon the We&s;t-end of the Theater, having a &s;tately Portal on that &s;ide, &s;u&s;tained by Pillars of the Corinthian Order. But the Front of it is to the Street Northward. It con&s;i&s;ts of ten Rooms, whereof the three principal and larg|e&s;t are publick, being in length about 56 foot, and in breadth 25. The uppermo&s;t is properly the <HI>Mu&s;aeum A&s;hmoleanum,</HI> &s;o called from <HI>Elias A&s;hmole</HI> E&s;quire, who inriched it with a noble Collection of Curio&s;ities. To which have been added &s;ince &s;everal Hiero|glyphicks, and other Aegyptian Antiquities by Dr. <HI>Robert Huntington;</HI> an intire Mum|my, by Mr. <HI>Aaron Goodyear;</HI> a large Cabinet of Natural Rarities, by <HI>Martin Li&s;ter,</HI> Dr. of Phy&s;ick; be&s;ides &s;everal Roman Antiqui|ties,
<PB N="345" REF="193">as Altars, Medals, Lamps, &amp;c. found here in England. So that in a few Years this is like to be one of the mo&s;t famous Re|po&s;itories in Europe. The middle Room is the School of Natural Hi&s;tory, where the Profe&s;&s;or of Chymi&s;try reads 3 times a Week, on Mundays, Wedne&s;days, and Fridays, during the time of the Chymical Cour&s;e, which continues a whole Month. His Bu&s;i|ne&s;s is to explain the natures, qualities, and virtues, &amp;c. of all natural Bodies, relating to and made u&s;e of in Chymical Preparations. The lower Room is the Laboratory, furni&s;h|ed with all &s;orts of Furnaces, and other Ma|terials, in order to Chymical Practice. Near unto which is the Store-Room for Chymical Preparations, and another fitted for a Chy|mical Library.</P>
<P>Now every Colledge has within its own Walls Lectures and Di&s;putations in all Libe|ral Arts; and &s;ome of them publick Le|ctures for all Comers, with large Salaries for the Readers. In&s;omuch that they &s;eem to be &s;o many Univer&s;ities.</P>
<P>The whole Number of Students in Oxford, that live upon the Revenues of the Colledges, is about One thou&s;and; and of other Students, about twice as many. Be&s;ides Stewards, Manciples, Butlers, Cooks, Porters, Garden|ers, &amp;c.</P>
<P>He that intends to take any Degree is to take his Diet and Lodging, and have a Tu|tor con&s;tantly, in &s;ome Colledge or Hall; where he mu&s;t be &s;ubject to all Statutes, and to the Head of the Hou&s;e. He mu&s;t be likewi&s;e &s;ubject to the chief Magi&s;trate of the Univer&s;ity, and the publick Statutes thereof. He is con&s;tantly to wear a black Cap and
<PB N="346" REF="194">Gown, only the Sons of Noblemen are herein indulged. By Night all Scholars are to be &s;hut up in their &s;everal Hou&s;es. And, before they can attain to any Degree, they mu&s;t per|form all Exerci&s;es.</P>
<P>The <HI>Degrees</HI> taken in the Univer&s;ity are in Arts properly but two, viz. of <HI>Batchelour</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;ter.</HI> To take the Degree of <HI>Batchelor</HI> is required 4 Years, and 3 Years more for to be <HI>Ma&s;ter of Arts.</HI></P>
<P>In the three Profe&s;&s;ions of Divinity, Law, and Phy&s;ick, there is a higher Degree, that of <HI>Doctor,</HI> which requires a great deal more time. For, to attain unto it, a Ma&s;ter of Arts mu&s;t be fir&s;t capable of being a <HI>Batche|lor</HI> in any of tho&s;e Profe&s;&s;ions; which in Divinity requires 7 Years more, in Law or Phy&s;ick mo&s;t commonly but 3. And, after that, before the Degree of <HI>Doctor</HI> can be had, 4 Years more is requi&s;ite.</P>
<P>The Exerci&s;es required for taking the&s;e Degrees are many, and difficult enough; yet not &s;uch but that they may be performed in le&s;s time by any Man of good Abilities. But &s;o much Time is required, fir&s;t becau&s;e Judgement and Di&s;cretion comes with Time and Years; and perhaps, that tho&s;e of &s;lower Parts might by Time and Indu&s;try make them|&s;elves capable of that Honour, as well as tho&s;e of quicker Abilities.</P>
<P>The Time of compleating the Degree of <HI>Batchelor of Arts</HI> is in Lent, at which time there commonly proceed about 200 Batche|lors. And that of compleating the Degree of <HI>Master of Arts,</HI> or of <HI>Doctor</HI> in any of the three Profe&s;&s;ions, is always the Munday after the &s;ixth of July, when there proceed <HI>Ma|&s;ters</HI> or <HI>Doctors</HI> yearly about 150. Then is
<PB N="347" REF="194">the <HI>Act,</HI> that is the Time, not only for pub|lick Exerci&s;es, but al&s;o for Fea&s;tings and Comedies, unle&s;s &s;ome extraordinary Occa|&s;ion do hinder it. Which draw's a mighty Concour&s;e of Strangers from all Parts to their Friends and Relations then compleat|ing their Degrees. Whereby, and by the &s;et Fees, it u&s;ually co&s;ts a Doctor about 100 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> &s;terling, and a Ma&s;ter of Arts 20 or 30 pounds.</P>
<P>But, be&s;ides the&s;e famous Societies in the Colledges and Halls of this Univer&s;ity, there is another lately e&s;tabli&s;hed, by the Name of the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Society,</HI> for the Improvement of real and experimental Philo&s;ophy. This Society (being much of the &s;ame nature as the Royal Society at London, with whom they have &s;ettled a Corre&s;pondency) meets every Tue&s;day in the Afternoon, by the per|mi&s;&s;ion and favour of the Government, in the Natural Hi&s;tory-School.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, as this City con&s;i&s;ts of two &s;orts of Inhabitants, Students and Citizens, living one among another, &s;o they are wholly &s;epa|rate for Government and Manners.</P>
<P>The chief Magi&s;trate of the Univer&s;ity is called the <HI>Chancellor,</HI> who is u&s;ually One of the prime Nobility, and neare&s;t in favour with the King; Elected by the Students them&s;elves in Convocation, to continue <HI>du|rante Vita.</HI> Who&s;e Office is to take care of the Government of the whole Univer&s;ity, to maintain the Liberties and Priviledges there|of, to call A&s;&s;emblies to hear and determine Controver&s;ies, to call Courts, puni&s;h Delin|quents, &amp;c.</P>
<PB N="348" REF="195">
<P>The next is the <HI>Vice-Chancellor,</HI> who is yearly nominated by the Chancellor, and is commonly the Head of &s;ome Colledge. His Duty is, in the Chancellor's ab&s;ence, to do whatever almo&s;t the Chancellour might do if he were pre&s;ent. He keeps Judicial Courts, wholly ruled by the Civil Law, which all Members of the Univer&s;ity are &s;ubject to. And, by Charter of Henry IV, it is left to his Choice, whether any Member in the Uni|ver&s;ity there inhabiting, accu&s;ed for Felony or High Trea&s;on, &s;hall be tried by the Laws of the Land, or by the Laws and Cu&s;toms of the Univer&s;ity. Though now, where Life or Limb is concerned, the Criminal is left to be tried by the Laws of the Land. But in all Suits for Debts, Accounts, Contracts, Injuries, &amp;c. betwixt the Students, he is the proper Judge; and has Power to determine &s;uch Cau&s;es, to Impri&s;on, to give corporal Puni&s;h|ment, to excommunicate, to &s;u&s;pend, and to bani&s;h.</P>
<P>'Tis the Vice-Chancellor's Bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;ee, that Sermons, Lectures, Di&s;putations, and other Exerci&s;es, be performed; that lewd people, Hereticks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> be expelled the Univer&s;ity, and the Conver&s;e with Stu|dents; that the Proctors, and other Officers of the Univer&s;ity, duly perform their Duty; that Courts be duly called, and Law-Suits determined without delay. In a word, that whatever is for the Honour and Benefit of the Univer&s;ity, or may conduce to the Ad|vancement of good Literature, may be care|fully obtained.</P>
<P>Next to the Vice-Chancellor are the two <HI>Proctors,</HI> yearly cho&s;en by turns out of the &s;everal Colledges. The&s;e are to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the
<PB N="349" REF="195">Government of the Univer&s;ity; more parti|cularly in the bu&s;ine&s;s of Schola&s;tick Exer|ci&s;es, and taking Degrees, in &s;earching after and puni&s;hing all Violaters of Statutes or Pri|viledges of the Univer&s;ity, all Night-Walkers, &amp;c. They have al&s;o the Over&s;ight of Weights and Mea&s;ures, that Students may not be wronged.</P>
<P>Next in order is the <HI>Publick Orator.</HI> Who&s;e Charge is to write Letters, according to the Orders of the Convocation or Congregation; and, at the Reception of any Prince or great Per&s;on that comes to &s;ee the Univer&s;ity, to make proper Harangues, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Then there is the <HI>Cu&s;tos Archivorum,</HI> or Keeper of Records. Who&s;e Duty is to collect and keep the Charters, Priviledges, and Records that concern the Univer&s;ity; to be always ready to produce them before the chief Officers; and to plead the Rights and Priviledges of the Univer&s;ity.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, there is a <HI>Regi&s;ter</HI> of the Univer|fity; who&s;e Office is to regi&s;ter all Tran&s;acti|ons in Convocations, Congregations, Delega|cies, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the fore&s;aid Officers, there are cer|tain publick Servants, the chief whereof are the &s;ix <HI>Beadles,</HI> and the <HI>Verger.</HI> Three of the fir&s;t are called <HI>Squire Beadles,</HI> who carry large Maces of Silver gilt; and the other three, <HI>Yeomen Beadles,</HI> who&s;e Maces are of Silver but ungilt. Their Office is always to wait on the Vice-Chancellor in publick, doing what belongs to his Place; and, at his Command, to &s;eize any Delinquent, and carry him to Pri&s;on; to &s;ummon, and publi&s;h the Calling of Courts or Convocations, to conduct Preachers to Church, and Lecturers to School,
<PB N="350" REF="196">&amp;c. But, upon Solemnities, the <HI>Verger</HI> ap|pears with a Silver Rod in his hand; and, walking with the other &s;ix before the Vice-Chancellor, is to ob&s;erve his Commands, and to wait on Grand Compounders, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I have already mentioned &s;everal great Priviledges, granted by former Kings to this Univer&s;ity. That of &s;ending two Burge&s;&s;es to Parliament they hold from King James I. An|other, that no Victuals be taken by the King's Purveyors within 5 miles of Oxford, unle&s;s the King him&s;elf comes thither, is of a much more ancient Date.</P>
<P>But one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable is That granted by Charter of King Edward III, whereby the Mayor of Oxford is to obey the Orders of the Vice-Chancellor, and be in &s;ubjection to him. Accordingly the May|or, with the chief Burge&s;&s;es in Oxford, and the High-Sheriff of Oxford&s;hire be&s;ides, eve|ry Year in a &s;olemn manner take an Oath, given by the Vice-Chancellor, to ob&s;erve and con&s;erve the Rights, Priviledges, and Li|berties of the Univer&s;ity of Oxford. And every Year on the tenth of February, be|ing the Day of <HI>S. Schola&s;tica,</HI> a certain Num|ber of the principal Burge&s;&s;es, publickly and &s;olemnly do pay to each Colledge a Peny, in token of their Submi&s;&s;ion to the Orders and Rights of the Univer&s;ity.</P>
<P>Thus you have a &s;hort De&s;cription of <HI>Ox|ford,</HI> as a City and an Univer&s;ity. My next Bu&s;ine&s;s is the De&s;cription of <HI>Cam|bridge.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="University town">
<HEAD>Cambridge.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CAMBRIDGE,</HI> the chief Town of Cambridge&s;hire, and that from whence the Country is denominated, bears from London
<PB N="351" REF="196">North by Ea&s;t, and is di&s;tant therefrom 44 miles, thus. From London to <HI>Waltham</HI> 12; to <HI>Ware,</HI> 8 more; thence to <HI>Puckeridge,</HI> 5; to <HI>Barkway,</HI> 7; and to <HI>Cambridge,</HI> 12 more.</P>
<P>'Tis &s;eated at the Confluence of two Ri|vers, the <HI>Cam</HI> and the <HI>Grant;</HI> which running from thence Northward in one Channel empty them&s;elves in the Ou&s;e, 3 miles above Ely. By the&s;e Rivers it is &s;eparated into two (but unequal) Parts, but they have Communication by a Bridge.</P>
<P>It is a Place of a large Extent, number|ing 14 Pari&s;hes. And, according to Doctor <HI>Fuller's</HI> Ob&s;ervation in his Worthies of En|gland, 'tis a Town within an Univer&s;ity, whereas <HI>Oxford</HI> is an Univer&s;ity within a Town. For in <HI>Cambridge</HI> the Colledges are not &s;o &s;urrounded with Streets as in <HI>Oxford,</HI> but for the generality &s;eated in the Skirts of the Town, which afford them the better and more delightfull Walks and Gardens about them.</P>
<P>There are in <HI>Oxford</HI> (as I &s;aid before) 18 Indowed Colledges, and 7 Halls. In <HI>Cam|bridge</HI> there is but 12 Colledges, and 4 Halls.

<P>The Batchelors of Arts compleat their De|gree in Lent, beginning at A&s;h-Wedne&s;day.

<P>The <HI>Mayor</HI> of the Town is like that of Oxford, &s;ubject to the Univer&s;ity, and takes a &s;olemn Oath, at the Entrance into his Office, to ob&s;erve and con&s;erve the Priviledges, Liberties, and Cu&s;toms thereof. And on Fri|day before St. Simon and Jude he brings with him to St. Maries Church, allotted for the A&s;&s;embly of the whole Univer&s;ity, two Al|dermen, four Burge&s;&s;es, and two of every Pari&s;h, to take their Oaths before the Vice-Chancellor, for the due &s;earch of Vagabonds, and &s;u&s;pected Per&s;ons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> At the &s;ame time are &s;worn 14 Per&s;ons for the Univer&s;ity, and 14 for the Town, to look to the Clean&s;ing and Paving of the Streets.</P>
<P>The Univer&s;ity has al&s;o a <HI>Court-Leet,</HI> held twice every Year, wherein are pre&s;ented all Nu&s;ances, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>What remains is the Que&s;tion about the Antiquity of <HI>Cambridge</HI> as a Place of Learn|ing, in oppo&s;ition to <HI>Oxford.</HI> To me it ap|pears to be in that re&s;pect of an older date than Oxford. For <HI>Cambridge,</HI> in the time of the Romans, (among whom it was known by the Name of <HI>Camboritum,</HI> or, as &s;ome Copies have it, <HI>Camboricum,</HI>) was a Roman Colony, mentioned in the be&s;t Copies among the 28 Cities of Britain. And the Roman Co|lonies had their Schools of Learning, where|in the &s;everal Profe&s;&s;ors of Arts and Sci|ences did in&s;truct both the Roman and Bri|ti&s;h Youth. In the Bull of Pope Honorius the fir&s;t, bearing date Febr. 20. 624, men|tion is made of Priviledges granted to the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Cambridge.</HI> The <HI>Bull</HI> &s;ays by <HI>Eleutherius,</HI> the 12th Bi&s;hop of Rome, who lived about the latter end of the &s;econd Cen|tury, but King Arthur's <HI>Diploma</HI> &s;ays by
<PB N="355" REF="198">Lucius, a Briti&s;h King, the fir&s;t Chri&s;tian King in Europe, and Contemporary with the &s;aid Eleutherius. Which <HI>Diploma</HI> &s;ays, that King Lucius was converted by the preaching of the Doctors of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> for which rea&s;on he gave Priviledges to that Univer&s;ity, which were confirmed by King Arthur. Whether the <HI>Diploma</HI> be counterfeit or not, or whe|ther the afore&s;aid Priviledges were granted by King Lucius or Pope Eleutherius, is a Que&s;tion by it &s;elf. Certain is, that both the <HI>Diploma</HI> and the <HI>Bull</HI> agree, in point of Time. So that here is Proof enough, to make it at lea&s;t probable, that in the time of King Lucius and Pope Eleutherius there might be a &s;ufficient Number of learn|ed Men in Cambridge to have in&s;tructed King Lucius in the Chri&s;tian Faith; and that Eluanus and Medwinus, who were &s;ent by that King to Rome for his fuller Satisfa|ction in that point, might be of that Num|ber.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e Grounds it mu&s;t be granted, that <HI>Cambridge</HI> is a Place long &s;ince dedi|cated unto Learning; and I doubt much whether Oxford (as great a Re&s;pect as I have for it) can pretend to &s;o great an Anti|quity.</P>
<P>But Dr. Heylin, an Oxonian, alledges a notable Rea&s;on for the Precedency of <HI>Oxford</HI> before <HI>Cambridge;</HI> Viz. the Re&s;olution of the Commons in the fir&s;t Parliament held under King James I. For (&s;ays he) when the Clerk of that Hou&s;e had put the Name of <HI>Cam|bridge</HI> before <HI>Oxford,</HI> they taking di&s;dainfully that <HI>Hy&s;teron-Proteron</HI> commanded the Antiqui|ties of both Univer&s;ities to be &s;earched, and after &s;earch made gave place to Oxford.</P>
<PB N="356" REF="199">
<P>To clear this Point, we mu&s;t take notice, that both <HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Cambridge,</HI> &s;ince their fir&s;t Foundation, lay for &s;everal Ages for|lorn and di&s;continued, during the long Wars of the Saxons and Danes in this I&s;land. Till <HI>Oxford</HI> had the happine&s;s to be fir&s;t re&s;tored by King Alfred, towards the latter end of the Ninth Century. Which from that time grew into &s;uch e&s;teem, as to be counted one of the four principal Univer&s;ities of Europe, the other three being <HI>Paris</HI> in France, <HI>Bono|nia</HI> (now <HI>Bologna</HI>) in Italy, and <HI>Salamanca</HI> in Spain. Whereas <HI>Cambridge</HI> did not begin to flouri&s;h again, till the Reign of Henry I, for his Learning &s;urnamed <HI>Beau-Clerc,</HI> that is in the beginning of the Twelfth Century. So that in point of Re&s;tauration, 'tis plain that <HI>Oxford</HI> has got the &s;tart of <HI>Cambridge.</HI></P>
<P>But let us leave this Speculation of <HI>Cam|bridge</HI> as an Academy, and look upon it as a Title of Honour. In this Point we &s;hall find <HI>Cambridge</HI> to have the Preeminency. For it has been Dignify'd, not only with the Title of an Earldom in &s;everal eminent Per&s;ons, but al&s;o with the Title of a Dukedom, in four Sons of the late King James, when Duke of York. Three of them by the fir&s;t Dutche&s;s, <HI>Charles, James,</HI> and <HI>Edgar,</HI> who all died very young; and the fourth, by the la&s;t Dutche&s;s <HI>Charles</HI> by Name, the &s;hort Hopes of the Popi&s;h Faction. Who, being born Nov. 7. 1677. died Dec. 12. following, and &s;o lived but five Weeks.</P>
<P>Thus I have done with <HI>OXFORD</HI> and <HI>CAMBRIDGE,</HI> tho&s;e two great Foun|tains of Learning, both &s;eated at almo&s;t an e|qual Di&s;tance from London, the one We&s;t,
<PB N="357" REF="199">and the other North. From whence are year|ly &s;ent forth a great Number of Divines, Civilians, Phy&s;icians, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to &s;erve all Parts of this Kingdom.</P>
<P>For a con&s;tant Supply whereof there are &s;everal Colledges and famous Schools in Eng|land; the principal <HI>Winche&s;ter, Eaton, We&s;t|min&s;ter, St. Pauls, Merchant-Taylors,</HI> and <HI>Charter-Hou&s;e,</HI> all richly Indowed, to maintain Ma|&s;ters, U&s;hers, and a certain Number of Scho|lars. So that a Child, once admitted into any of the&s;e Schools, may by his Capacity be preferred to be a Scholar, or Fellow in &s;ome Colledge of one of the&s;e Univer&s;ities. Where having a good Allowance, he will want little or no help from his Parents all his Life|time after.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THAT the <HI>Britains</HI> were the ancient Inhabitants of <HI>England,</HI> is a Thing agreed by all. But, whether they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ere the <HI>Aborigines,</HI> that is, the very fir&s;t In|abitants of all, it may be made a Que&s;tion,
<PB N="2" REF="202">and &s;uch as can &s;carce be &s;olved. Therefore that wi&s;e Roman Hi&s;torian, <HI>Tacitus,</HI> puts it off with an Ignoramus; <HI>Qui Mortales</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>Initio coluerint, parum compertum e&s;t.</HI> As to the Original of the <HI>Britains</HI> them&s;elves, <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> proves them to be derived from the <HI>Gauls,</HI> by their Agreeablene&s;s in their Making, Speech, Man|ners, Laws, and Cu&s;toms. A rude and illite|rate Nation, who&s;e Learning (&s;uch as it was) was all lockt up in the brea&s;ts of the <HI>Druids,</HI> their Prie&s;ts; who communicated what they knew to none but tho&s;e of their own Order, and by that means kept the People (much like the Papi&s;ts of our Days) in continual Ignorance of their &s;acred My&s;teries.</P>
<P>The Romans began the Conque&s;t of this Peo|ple under the Emperor <HI>Claudius,</HI> about the middle of the fir&s;t Century, and compleated it in the time of <HI>Domitian,</HI> as far at lea&s;t as the <HI>Frythes</HI> of <HI>Edenburgh</HI> and <HI>Dunbarton</HI> in Scotland; unwilling to venture further, where there was nothing to be got but blows, cold, and hunger. For, as to <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> he rather di&s;covered than con|quered England; and his three next Succe&s;&s;ors, <HI>Augu&s;tus, Tiberius,</HI> and <HI>Caligula,</HI> made no Attempt upon it. So that we cannot properly reckon the Conque&s;t of England, but from the Empire o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Claudius,</HI> Uncle to <HI>Caligula.</HI> Thus the <HI>Britains</HI> continued &s;ubject to the <HI>Romans</HI> about 400 Years after Chri&s;t, till the Reign of <HI>Honorius:</HI> When Italy being invaded by the Goths, the Romans abandoned Britain, to defend their own Country.</P>
<P>After the <HI>Romans</HI> were departed, under who&s;e Protection and ea&s;y Government the <HI>Britains</HI> lived comfortably, they &s;oon became a Prey to the <HI>Picts</HI> and <HI>Saxons;</HI> but chiefly t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the <HI>Saxons</HI> who never left off teazing of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="3" REF="202"><HI>Britains,</HI> till the&s;e quitted the Stage, and re|tired beyond the Severn into Wales. Thus <HI>England</HI> came to be wholly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by a new Nation, that is, an aggregate Body of many People among&s;t the Germans, who came hither to try their fortune.</P>
<P>After the <HI>Saxons</HI> came the <HI>Danes,</HI> the next con&s;iderable, and the mo&s;t cruel Actors on the Stage of England. Who, in the time of <HI>Egbert</HI> the Saxon Monarch, (that is, in the Ninth Century) fir&s;t invaded this Country; and &s;o exerci&s;ed the patience of his Po&s;terity, till at la&s;t they overpowred them, and got the King|dom to them&s;elves. But then the <HI>Saxons</HI> and <HI>Danes</HI> lived together, mixed in Marriages and Alliance, and &s;o made one Nation con&s;i&s;ting of <HI>Saxons</HI> and <HI>Danes.</HI></P>
<P>At la&s;t, in the eleventh Century, the <HI>Nor|mans</HI> (a Northern People of France) came in with their Duke <HI>William.</HI> Who in one Battel got his pretended Right to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> and from a &s;ingle Victory the Title of <HI>Conquerour.</HI> Now the <HI>Normans</HI> mixing (as they did) with the Body of this Nation, we may &s;ay, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bloud at this day is a Mixture chiefly of <HI>Saxon, Dane,</HI> and <HI>Norman,</HI> not without a Tincture of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> and <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Blood.</P>
<P>And, as the Country is temperate and moi&s;t, &s;o the Engli&s;h have naturally the advantage of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> clear Complexion; not Sindged as in hot Climates, nor Weather-beaten as in cold Regi|ons. The generality, of a comely Stature, graceful Countenance, well-featured, gray|yed, and brown-haired. But for Talne&s;s and Strength the We&s;tern People exceed all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;t.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="203">
<P>The Women generally more hand&s;om than in other Places, and without Sophi&s;tications &s;ufficiently indowed with natural beauties. In an ab&s;olute Woman, &s;ay the Italians, are re|quired the Parts of a Dutch-Woman from the Wa&s;te downwards; of a French-Woman, from the Wa&s;te up to the Shoulders; and over them an Engli&s;h Pace. Therefore an Engli&s;h-Woman makes one of the &s;ix Things wherein England excels, comprehended in this Latine Ver&s;e,
<Q>Anglia, Mons, Pons, Fons, Eccle&s;ia, Foemina, Lana.</Q></P>
<P>That is to &s;ay, For Mountains, Bridges, Rivers, Churches fair, Women, and Wool, <HI>England</HI> is pa&s;t Compare.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, there is no Country in Europe where Youth is generally &s;o charming, Men &s;o proper and well proportioned, and Women &s;o beauti|ful.</P>
<P>The Truth is, this Happine&s;s is not only to be attributed to the Clemency of the Air. Their ea&s;y Life unde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e be&s;t of Governments, which &s;aves them from the Drudgery and Hard|&s;hip of other Nations, has a great hand in it. And the Experience of a Neighbouring People &s;hew's us &s;ufficiently, there's nothing more de|&s;tructive of good Complexion than that Mon|&s;ter of Slavery. A fit Subject therefore for that Sex, which is &s;o tender of Beauty, to chew upon.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h <HI>Temper</HI> is naturally &s;utable to their Climate. They are neither &s;o fiery a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the French, nor &s;o cold as the Northern People; better tempered for Coun&s;el than th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> fir&s;t, for Execution than the la&s;t. A happy tem|per
<PB N="5" REF="203">be&s;ides for all &s;orts of Learning. The gene|rality of them re&s;erved and wary, not apt to communicate but with their be&s;t and &s;erious Acquaintances. And as their Friend&s;hip is not ea&s;ily gained, &s;o when once got 'tis not ea&s;ily lo&s;t.</P>
<P>The Mi&s;chief is, that by their different In|tere&s;ts both in Civil Matters and Points of Re|ligion, they are apt to be divided into Facti|ons, which takes off very much from their Happine&s;s. After &s;o great a Deliverance as they were lately ble&s;&s;ed with, who would have thought that there &s;hould be now a Party, (tho incon|&s;iderable) which repineth at it? And that a Prote&s;tant Party; who, like the I&s;raelites, have a lingering Mind after the Onions of Egypt. Brought as they are out of Captivity by the wounderful hand of Providence into a happy &s;tate of Liberty, they grumble, and weary of their happine&s;s &s;eem willing to exchange their Mo&s;es for a Pharaoh. Were none but they concerned in the Change, 'tis pity but they &s;hould have it, and be cru&s;hed into Common Sen&s;e. They put me in mind of tho&s;e &s;illy Women in Mo|&s;covy, (which according to Olearius) fancy their Husbands love them be&s;t that whip 'em mo&s;t.</P>
<P>For Courage, I cannot but &s;ay this for the Engli&s;h, That Death, the King of Terrours, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o where &s;o affronted as it is among&s;t them. Whether I look upon tho&s;e that die privately in their Beds, or publickly upon a Scaffold or Gibet, I &s;ee &s;o much Unconcernedne&s;s, that 'tis a wonder how a Nation that lives in &s;o much ca&s;e &s;hould value their Lives &s;o little. In point of Fighting, 'tis true they are not altogether &s;o ha&s;ty as the French to fight out a &s;ingle Quar|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">el. But 'tis not &s;o much for want of Courage,
<PB N="6" REF="204">as out of re&s;pect to the Laws, which are &s;evere upon tho&s;e that break the Peace.</P>
<P>For, upon a publick Account, when Men fight with Authority, no Nation &s;hew's more forwardne&s;s. As they are a free People, their Spirits are accordingly aver&s;e from Slavery, and as greedy of Glory. Their Fore fathers Exploits, which by oral Tradition, and read|ing of Hi&s;tories, they are generally pretty well acquainted with, adds much to their Courage, But e&s;pecially the Notion of their Conque&s;t of France is &s;o univer&s;ally &s;pread all over the Nation, and their Antipathy again&s;t the French &s;o great and univer&s;al, that one may rea&s;onably expect a good Succe&s;s from their fir&s;t Attempt upon France, when Opportunity &s;hall &s;erve. For de&s;perate Attempts no Nation like the Engli&s;h, either by Sea or Land. If they be bent upon Fighting, they go to it undaunted, without telling the Number, or valuing the Strength of their Enemies. With this bold and undaunted Courage, not common with other Nations, they have &s;ometimes outdone the very Romans them&s;elves; and for this I appeal particularly to the Hi&s;tory of France, where with a hand-full of Men they have rout|ed and defeated the brave&s;t Armies. 'Tis true they were at la&s;t expelled from thence, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their Expul&s;ion was not &s;o much the Fruit o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the French Valour, as the Effect of our Divi|&s;ions. So redoubted they were afterwards i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> France, that in the Wars between Charles VIII and the Duke of Bretagne, the Duke, to &s;trik<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a Terrour among&s;t the French, apparelled 150<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of his own Subjects in the Arms and Cro&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> England. But it proved as the A&s;s, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> had on the Lions Skin.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="204">
<P>For a further Proof of the Engli&s;h Valour, I might recount their Victories of old over the Iri&s;h, Scots, Cypriots, and Turks. And Spain it &s;elf has &s;ufficiently experienced both by Sea and Land the Engli&s;h Valour, to its co&s;t; but by Sea e&s;pecially. Wit|ne&s;s the Battel <HI>Anno</HI> 1588. where Q. Eliza|beth, with a few Ships, vanqui&s;hed the Spa|ni&s;h Fleet, which for the greatne&s;s of it was called <HI>Invincible.</HI> Sir Francis Drake, the Year before that, had with four Ships only took from the Spaniard one Million and 189200 Ducats in one Voyage. And afterwards with 25 Ships he awed the Ocean, &s;acked S. Jago, S. Dominico, and Carthagena; carrying away with him, be&s;ides Trea&s;ure, 240 Pieces of Ord|nance. Sr. Richard Greenvile, Captain of one of the Queens Ships called the Revenge, with 180 Souldiers (whereof 90 were di&s;abled with Sickne&s;s) maintained a Sea-fight for 24 hours a|gain&s;t an incredible Number of the Spani&s;h Gal|leons, &s;unk four of the greate&s;t, and killed &s;e|veral thou&s;ands of their Men. Till at la&s;t, her Powder being &s;pent to the la&s;t Barrel, &s;he yielded upon honourable Terms, yet was never brought into Spain. To this I &s;hall add the famous Adventure of John Oxenham an Eng|li&s;hman, one of the Followers of Sr. Francis Drake, in the We&s;t Indies. Where being land|ed in a &s;mall Barque, with 70 of his Compa|nions, a little above <HI>Nombre de Dios</HI> in the I&s;thmus of Panama, he drew his Barque on Land, covered it with Boughs, and marched over the Land with his Company, guided by Negroes, till he came to a River. There he cut down Wood, to make him a Pinnace; where|with he entred the South Sea, and went to the I&s;le of Pearls. About which I&s;land in few days
<PB N="8" REF="205">he &s;urprized two Spani&s;h Ships, with an incre|dible Trea&s;ure of Gold and Silver, and &s;o re|turned in &s;afety to the Land. An Adventure not to be forgotten, and recorded by Spani&s;h Writers with much admiration; &s;o bold was the Attempt, &s;o &s;trange the Succe&s;s, and &s;o prodigious the Booty.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things I thought fit to record, now this is a Time for Action. We have a great Enemy to incounter with, the Iri&s;h, but only great by their Numbers. 'Tis but fighting with Cyphers. But with the French there is both Laurels and Booty to be got. And, if the Eng|li&s;h Souldiery will but &s;eriou&s;ly reflect how much this Nation has been in the late Reigns abu&s;ed and undermined by Them, who&s;e Ma|&s;ters they were formerly, I doubt not but with Gods Ble&s;&s;ing and their natural Courage, under the Conduct of a magnanimous King and of a great General, they will right them&s;elves, and be a glorious In&s;trument for the &s;etling the Peace of Europe upon a &s;ure and la&s;ting Foun|dation.</P>
<P>The Character of Pride which <HI>Scaliger</HI> gives the Engli&s;h Nation,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Scaliger <HI>de Re Poe|tica, Lib.</HI> 3. <HI>Cap.</HI> 16.</NOTE> when he calls them <HI>In|flatos &amp; Contemptores,</HI> is a Character common to mo&s;t Nations, but to none &s;o well adapted as to his own. For the French, like the Ro|mans of old, look upon mo&s;t other Nations as barbarous, and count them&s;elves the mo&s;t ac|compli&s;hed. I confe&s;s they have great many good Qualifications, but this pre&s;umptuous Con|ceit &s;poils all. And, all Things being con&s;i|dered, if the Engli&s;h have a little Pride, it is perhaps the be&s;t grounded of any Nation.</P>
<P>Cruelty and Barbarity, which the &s;ame Au|thor charges 'em with, when he calls them <HI>Inho&s;pitales, Immanes,</HI> is a meer Phanta&s;m of his
<PB N="9" REF="205">own. 'Tis true, the Engli&s;h are not &s;o fawn|ing as the French upon Strangers, becau&s;e they can make better &s;hift without them; but I hope they don't want common Civility. They have indeed &s;ome thing of a natural Antipathy again&s;t the French, as there is to this day be|twixt the French and the Spaniards. Yet, when the French Prote&s;tants fled to them for Refuge in the late Per&s;ecution, the &s;trength of their Charity overcame their Nature. They laid a|&s;ide their inbred Prejudices, and forthwith made it their bu&s;ine&s;s to relieve them as Bre|thren, who &s;uffered for their Religion. How mo|derate they have been towards the plotting Papi&s;ts, I leave the World to judge. Had the Huguenots of France plotted again&s;t the Go|vernment there, as the Papi&s;ts have done here ever &s;ince the Reformation, what do you think could have expiated their Crime? Nothing but a quick and general Ma&s;&s;acre, &s;uch as they &s;uffered under Charles IX, without the lea&s;t Provocation. The late Experience tells us, what Spirit of Cruelty has po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the French; when, upon the Kings Prote&s;tant Subjects ut|mo&s;t Submi&s;&s;ion to him in Civil Matters, and his mo&s;t &s;olemn and &s;acred Ingagements to pre|&s;erve their Liberties, this very Prince (whom they had lifted upon the Throne, with the ex|pence of their Bloud) contrary to Equity and the Laws of the Land, to his Oaths and Promi&s;es, and to the Rules of Gratitude and Humanity, let them loo&s;e to the Cruelty of his Apo&s;tolick Dragoons; by whom they were cru&s;hed, per&s;ecu|ted, and u&s;ed beyond the Barbarity of the very Heathens them&s;elves. But in England, as obnoxi|ous as the Catholicks are to the Government, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d liable to the la&s;h of the Law, &s;till they are tole <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|ted, and connived at, almo&s;t beyond mea&s;ure. Were
<PB N="10" REF="206"><HI>Scaliger</HI> alive, what could he &s;ay to all this? How could he an&s;wer the late cruel Burnings and Deva&s;tations the French made in Germany, con|trary to the Rules of War, and the very Pra|ctice of the mo&s;t barbarous Nations? And what could he &s;ay to their genteel Way of Poy&s;on|ing, wherein they have been of late &s;o dexte|rous, and the Engli&s;h &s;o dull?</P>
<P>But, to clear further the Engli&s;h from that foul Imputation of Cruelty and Barbarity, if we look upon their Plantations abroad, who more courteous and gentle than this Nation? If we in&s;pect their Proceedings again&s;t Male|factors, no Nation in the World &s;hews &s;o much humanity, or proceeds with more equity. The barbarous U&s;e of Racks, apt to extort Confe&s;|&s;ion right or wrong, is ab&s;olutely laid a&s;ide among&s;t us. Nothing but the Pri&s;oners un|forced Confe&s;&s;ion, or the Depo&s;ition of Wit|ne&s;&s;es upon Oath made out with good Circum|&s;tances, will take a Mans Life away. The Break|ing on the Wheel, and other like torturing Deaths, are lookt upon here as too cruel for Chri&s;tians to u&s;e. Neither are the Criminals, who with their Lives have expiated their Crimes before the World, denied Chri&s;tian Burial, ex|cept in particular Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>All this &s;hews a great deal of Moderati|on, and aver&s;ene&s;s from Cruelty. And, if we look upon the Engli&s;h in their private Fami|lies, there we &s;hall find a greater Harmony than perhaps in any Nation. For here generally Husbands are the mo&s;t Kind to their Wives, Wives as tender of their Husbands, and Pa|rents indulgent to Children. The fir&s;t is &s;o great a Truth, that England is every where acknowledged to be the Paradi&s;e of Women, as it is the Hell of Hor&s;es. And it is a com|mon
<PB N="11" REF="206">By-Word among the Italians, that, if there were a Bridge over the Narrow Seas, all the Women of Europe would run into England. For here they are neither &s;o &s;ervilely &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive as the French, nor &s;o jealou&s;ly garded as the Italian. Here they have the upper hand in the Streets, the upper place at Table, the Thirds of their Husbands E&s;tates, and in many Ca&s;es &s;hare in all Lands.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h I could clear the Engli&s;h a&s;well from Wantonne&s;s and Debauchery, as I have from Cruelty. But, if they have too much degene|rated in this point from their Ance&s;tors, the Rea&s;on of it is at hand,
<Q>Regis ad Exemplum totus componitur Orbis.</Q></P>
<P>And, if that Rule be con&s;tantly true, we have now the faire&s;t Pro&s;pect of a Reformation that ever Nation had, and the greate&s;t Rea&s;on to hope &s;hortly to &s;ee the Engli&s;h, now under a &s;ober and religious (as well as a warlike) Prince, recover their Reputation, which has been &s;o long ob&s;cured by the Licentiou&s;ne&s;s of two effeminate Reigns.</P>
<P>From their Temper I proceed to their <HI>Genius,</HI> wherein our Characterizer is no le&s;s abu&s;ive. And one would think his too much Learning made him mad, when he calls the Engli&s;h no le&s;s than <HI>&s;tolidos, amentes, inertes,</HI> that is, wit|le&s;s, and dull. The Truth is, other Nations are as deeply ingaged as the Engli&s;h again&s;t him in this Quarrel, of whom he gives like|wi&s;e an unmanly Character. But, to confute him in this Point, this I dare aver, that no Nation has been more indu&s;trious than the Eng|li&s;h in Mechanick Arts, and the World to this day is obliged to them for many of their u&s;e|full
<PB N="12" REF="207">Inventions and Di&s;coveries. For Merchan|dizing and Navigation, no People can com|pare with them but the Hollanders, and their great Wealth ari&s;ing from thence is a plain Proof and Demon&s;tration of it. For Litera|ture, e&s;pecially &s;ince the Reformation, there is no Nation in the World &s;o generally knowing. And, as Experimental Philo&s;ophy, &s;o Divinity both Schola&s;tick and Practical has been Im|proved here beyond all other Places. Which makes Forein Divines, and the be&s;t &s;ort of them, &s;o conver&s;ant with the learned Works of tho&s;e famous Lights of the Church, our be&s;t Engli&s;h Divines.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the Engli&s;h <HI>Genius</HI> is for clo&s;e Speaking and Writing, and always to the Point. They look upon loo&s;e and rambling Di&s;cour&s;es with contempt and indignation, tho' they be &s;ea&s;oned with never &s;o much wit. The gawdy part and pomp of Rhetorick, &s;o much affected by the French, is &s;lighted by the Engli&s;h; who, like Men of Rea&s;on, &s;tick chiefly to Logick. And what they &s;peak in publick they deliver it with a Gravity &s;utable to the Subject, &s;lighting tho&s;e mimical Ge&s;ticulations &s;o much u&s;ed be|yond Sea, and indeavouring not &s;o much to move the Hearer's Affections as to convince his Rea&s;on. <HI>Gutta cavat Lapidem.</HI></P>
<P>No Nation perhaps is more <HI>Satyrical,</HI> and quicker in <HI>Repartees,</HI> but &s;till with much gravi|ty; and I have often wondered at the Acute|ne&s;s of &s;ome of the common Sort, which ar|gues more Wit than our Cen&s;urer allow's.</P>
<P>To expre&s;s them&s;elves &s;ignificantly, and with the greate&s;t advantages, they have a mo&s;t happy <HI>Language,</HI> tho' (like their Bloud) it be but a Mixture. For it is a Compound
<PB N="13" REF="207">chiefly of the&s;e three, <HI>Saxon, Latine,</HI> and <HI>French;</HI> but &s;o that the <HI>Saxon</HI> is the Stock, in which the other two are Ingrafted.</P>
<P>As for the Excellency of it, I have little to add to what has been lately publi&s;hed by Mr. <HI>Miege</HI> in his Prefatory Di&s;cour&s;e to his <HI>Engli&s;h Grammar.</HI> The Excellency (&s;ays he) of the Eng|li&s;h Tongue con&s;i&s;ts in the&s;e four Things, viz. its <HI>Facility, Copiou&s;ne&s;s, Significancy,</HI> and <HI>Sweetne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Its <HI>Facility</HI> is ea&s;ily demon&s;trable in its Ex|emption from Flexions, from that Multiplicity of Ca&s;es, and other Variations, which an Au|thor calls the Emblems of Babel's Cur&s;e and Confu&s;ion. The Invariablene&s;s of its Nouns Adjective makes their Concordance ea&s;y with the Sub&s;tantives. The Pronouns, &s;o puzzling and intricate in French, admit of little diffi|culty in Engli&s;h; and what is more ea&s;y than the Conjugation of Engli&s;h Verbs? In&s;tead of one Particle <HI>(To)</HI> u&s;ed before the Infinitive, the French have no le&s;s than three Prepo&s;iti|ons, <HI>de, a</HI> and <HI>pour,</HI> differently u&s;ed in that Mood. Nor is the Engli&s;h troubled with Verbs Reciprocal, one of the harde&s;t Ingredients of that Language; e&s;pecially when u&s;ed with an Interrogation, and the&s;e intricate Particles <HI>en, y, ne,</HI> and <HI>pas,</HI> the right placing of which is &s;o puzzling to Strangers.</P>
<P>The <HI>Copiou&s;ne&s;s</HI> I need not u&s;e much art to demon&s;trate. For, be&s;ides the Trea&s;ures of the old Saxon which the Engli&s;h retains in its Mono&s;yllables, the choicer Wits of the Nation have fetcht hither the very Quinte&s;&s;ence of &s;ome forein Languages; who, like Bees, have gathered the be&s;t, and left the wor&s;t. By which means they have &s;o happily improved their Mother-Tongue, that tho&s;e among&s;t Fo|reiners who under&s;tand the Genius of it are
<PB N="14" REF="208">in a maze to &s;ee this Language &s;o far outdo their own, and to find many of their tran&s;|planted Words thrive better in England than in their proper and natural Soil. And, where|as the French is &s;tinted, and grown barren through its exceeding Nicety, the Engli&s;h on the contrary is grown mighty Copious, by its innate Liberty of making &s;uch Compounds and Derivatives as are proper and &s;utable to abridge the Expre&s;&s;ion, and to &s;ay <HI>Multum in parvo.</HI> In&s;omuch that it do's almo&s;t equalize the Greek, and even exceed the Latine, in a peculiar grace of compounding Words toge|ther, which is one of the greate&s;t Beauties that can be in a Language. Nor do's its Abundance ly here altogether; there being Court and Country Engli&s;h, and peculiar Dia|lects (be&s;ides the general one) in the We&s;t and North Countries. In &s;hort, no Vulgar Lan|guage can deliver a Matter with more Variety, either plainly by Synonima's, or by Circumlo|cution with Metaphors.</P>
<P>The <HI>Significancy</HI> of the Engli&s;h is made out to my hand by the <HI>Vindex Anglicus,</HI> in Words to this effect. There is &s;carce, &s;ays he, any Variety that any other Nation can brag of, but the Engli&s;h has almo&s;t with equal felicity made its own. Witne&s;s the <HI>Italian Courtier,</HI> the <HI>French Salu&s;t,</HI> the <HI>Spani&s;h Guzman,</HI> the <HI>Latine Na&s;o,</HI> and the <HI>Greek Polybius.</HI> Whoever reads that matchle&s;s E&s;&s;ay of Mr. <HI>Sandys</HI> upon the <HI>Aeneids,</HI> would think it writ &s;o by the peerle&s;s <HI>Maro</HI> him&s;elf. How properly has the renown|ed Lord <HI>Bacon</HI> taught us to &s;peak the Terms of Art in our own Language? A Thing Judged impo&s;&s;ible, till we &s;aw it performed. What matchle&s;s and incomparable Pieces have we &s;een in our Time, and where &s;hall one &s;ee
<PB N="15" REF="208">more &s;en&s;e in &s;o few Words? What Poetry has more Maje&s;ty, and bears a greater &s;en&s;e than the Engli&s;h, when it flows from a true Poet?</P>
<P>In point of <HI>Sweetne&s;s,</HI> whereas the <HI>Italian</HI> &s;warms with Vowels, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> with Con|&s;onants, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> has the Advantage of them both in a happy Mixture. 'Tis true, the <HI>Italian</HI> is an excellent, Princely, and plea&s;ant Language; but it wants Sinews, and pa&s;&s;es as &s;ilent Water. The <HI>French</HI> is truly delicate, but &s;omething too nice and affected; the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Maje&s;tical, but terrible and boi&s;terous; the <HI>Dutch</HI> manly, but har&s;h. Now the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> is both &s;weet, and man|ly. 'Tis true, there are in it &s;ome particular &s;ounds unknown to the French Tongue; which are indeed &s;omething har&s;h and uncouth in the mouth of a French Learner, and yet very &s;mooth when they run in their proper and na|tural Channel. Viz. <HI>i</HI> long, as in <HI>Vice; ou</HI> and <HI>ow,</HI> in <HI>Cloud, Vow,</HI> &amp;c; <HI>o</HI> and <HI>i,</HI> as in <HI>God, Lord, bird,</HI> and <HI>&s;hirt,</HI> pronounced with a mixt &s;ound of the French <HI>o</HI> and <HI>a.</HI> But tho&s;e which puzzle mo&s;t of all the French Learner are the found of <HI>g</HI> before <HI>e</HI> and <HI>i,</HI> and (which is the &s;ame Thing,) of <HI>j</HI> Con&s;onant before any Vowel, as in <HI>ginger, jack, je&s;t, jil, jog,</HI> and <HI>jug;</HI> of <HI>ch,</HI> as in <HI>Chamber;</HI> but chiefly of <HI>th,</HI> called a <HI>t</HI> a&s;pi|rate, as in <HI>thanks, thief, thorough, thunder,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, &s;uch is the mixture of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that one may frame his Speech maje&s;tical, plea|&s;ant, delicate, or manly, according to the Sub|ject. Of all which Advantages inherent to the Engli&s;h Tongue Foreiners are at la&s;t become very &s;en&s;ible. For, whereas they u&s;ed to &s;light it as an In&s;ular Speech, not worth their taking notice, they are at pre&s;ent great Admirers of it.</P>
<PB N="16" REF="209">
<P>What remains is to an&s;wer the u&s;ual <HI>Ob|jections</HI> again&s;t it, whereby &s;ome People pretend to degrade it from the Worth of a Language, viz. its <HI>Mixture,</HI> and <HI>Mutability. Mixture,</HI> a Thing &s;o very natural to Languages, that none but the <HI>Hebrew</HI> (if that) is free from it. The <HI>Latine</HI> it &s;elf had a great Mixture of Greek and Gothi&s;h. The <HI>French</HI> con&s;i&s;ts of Latine, Dutch, and old Gallick. The <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> of Latine, Gothi&s;h, and Mori&s;co. And the <HI>German</HI> it &s;elf, as Original as it is pretended to be, has a ta&s;te of the Ro|man Empire, and the bordering Neighbours. As for its <HI>Mutability,</HI> 'tis at lea&s;t as groundle&s;s an Objection. For 'tis well known, that Lan|guages, as States, have their Infancy and Age, their Wax and Wane.</P>
<P>But now the Engli&s;h Tongue is come to &s;o great Perfection, now 'tis grown &s;o very Co|pious and Significant, by the acce&s;&s;ion of the quinte&s;&s;ence and life of other Tongues, 'twere to be wi&s;hed that a &s;top were put to this un|bounded Way of Naturalizing forein Words, and that none hereafter &s;hould be admitted but with Judgement and Authority. For the Truth is, there is as much in it as is needful, and as much as the Engli&s;h Soil is well able to bear.</P>

<P><HI>Of the Engli&s;h</HI> Names, <HI>and of their Way of</HI> Computing.</P>

<P>CHri&s;tian Names, &s;ays <HI>Cambden,</HI> were fir&s;t impo&s;ed for the Di&s;tinction of Per&s;ons; Surnames, for the Di&s;tinction of Fa|milies.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t, among&s;t the Engli&s;h, are either Saxon; as <HI>Edward, Gilbert, Henry, Richard, Walter, William,</HI> &amp;c. Or taken out of the Holy Writ; as <HI>Abraham, Jacob, James, J&s;aac,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>'Tis rare for the Engli&s;h to have two Chri&s;ten Names together, as they have in Ger|many. But it is not unu&s;ual with them to chri&s;ten Children by their Godfathers Sur|names, which is unpracti&s;ed beyond Sea.</P>
<P>The Ancients took particular care to give their Children &s;ignificative and good Names, according to the Proverb, <HI>Bonum Nomen, Bonum Omen.</HI> And the Pythagoreans affirmed the Minds, Actions, and Succe&s;&s;es of Men to be ac|cording to their Fate, Genius, and Name. In &s;hort, &s;uch was Mens Super&s;tition of old in this particular, that they u&s;ed a kind of Divination by Names, called <HI>Onomantia,</HI> which was con|demned by the la&s;t General Council.</P>
<P>The Story of Augu&s;tus the Emperour is re|markable upon this Subject. The Day before his Sea-fight at <HI>Actium,</HI> the fir&s;t Man he met was a poor Man, driving his A&s;s before him. Augu&s;tus demanded his Name; and he an&s;wer|ed

<P>Alfon&s;o IV. King of Ca&s;tille had two Daugh|ters, by one of the Daughters of Henry II. King of England.

The Name of <HI>&V;rraca,</HI> though the more beautiful Lady, proved unplea&s;ing; and that of the Lady <HI>Blanche,</HI> &s;ignifying Fair and Beautiful, carried it, as a Name that would be more acceptable in France.</P>
<P>For my part, though I am not &s;o much a Pythagorean as to think a Mans Name &s;hould in|terpret his Fate; yet I think it not ami&s;s to name Children with Names of a happy &s;ignifi|cation, as it was u&s;ual among the Primitive Chri&s;tians, were it but to &s;tir them up to live according to their Names, and not give them|&s;elves the lie.</P>

<PB N="27" REF="214">Fitz-William,</HI> that is, Robert the Son of Wil|liam; <HI>Henry Fitz Gerard,</HI> that is, Henry the Son of Gerard.</P>
<P>What remains is to an&s;wer the Que&s;tion, how people came by their Names. <HI>Cambden</HI> thinks (as it is probable enough) that &s;ome took up their Names them&s;elves, and others had their Names given them by the People, in whom lies the Sovereignty of Words and Names. Among&s;t the fir&s;t he reckons tho&s;e that a&s;&s;umed local Names of &s;uch Places as they were Owners of. And, among&s;t the Au|thors of the la&s;t, e&s;pecially the Diminutives, he brings in the Nur&s;es as the principal.</P>
<P>Neither is it improbable, &s;ay's he, but that many Names, that &s;eem unfitting for Men, as tho&s;e of bruti&s;h Bea&s;ts, &amp;c. came from the very Signs of the Hou&s;es where they inhabited. And he alledges for In&s;tance &s;ome that, living at the Sign of the Dolphin, Bull, and White-Hor&s;e, were commonly called <HI>Thomas</HI> at the <HI>Dolphin, Will</HI> at the <HI>Bull, George</HI> at the <HI>White-Hor&s;e.</HI> Which Names (as many others of the like &s;ort) with omitting <HI>At,</HI> became after|wards hereditary to their Children.</P>
<P>Another Thing ob&s;ervable in Names is their frequent Change, a Thing practi&s;ed of old by the Romans them&s;elves. For &s;ome have chan|ged their Names, to avoid the Opinion of Ba&s;e|ne&s;s; others, in remembrance of their more honourable Progenitors. Some upon the Ac|count of Adoption, others in remembrance of &s;ome particular Favours. Some again, by ta|king the Names of tho&s;e who&s;e Lands they had; and others, by taking the Name of their own Office. As when <HI>Edward Fitz-Theobald</HI> was made <HI>Butler</HI> of Ireland, the Earls of <HI>Or|mond,</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="215">and others de&s;cended from them, took the Name of <HI>Butler.</HI></P>
<P>The Pride of Scholars has al&s;o wrought Al|terations in &s;ome Names. And the fear of Puni&s;hment has been all along the Occa&s;ion of &s;everal Mens changing their Names, to avoid being di&s;covered. But Time e&s;pecially has changed Names the mo&s;t, by contracting, curtailing, and mollifying of them in &s;uch a manner, that they are quite another Thing from what they were at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, Foreiners may ob&s;erve, that Women in England at their Marriage change their Surnames, and pa&s;s into their Husbands Names. Which is but rea&s;onable, becau&s;e married peo|ple <HI>Non &s;unt duo, &s;ed Caro una,</HI> they are but one Fle&s;h. And yet in France, and el&s;ewhere, married Women retain &s;o far their own Names with their Husbands, as to write them&s;elves by their Fathers Surnames.</P>
<P>I come now to the Engli&s;h Way of Com|puting. Who do not begin the Year till the 25th of March, being the Day of Chri&s;t's Incar|nation; wherein they agree with Spain. This is the Rule, both in Church and State; accord|ing to which they date all their publick Writ|ings. Though, according to the Cycles of the Sun and Moon, they allow the Year to begin only the fir&s;t of January; which therefore is by them called, as by mo&s;t other Chri&s;tians in Europe, the New-Years Day. And, to di|&s;tingui&s;h that mongrel Time from the fir&s;t of January to the 25th of March following, 'tis u&s;ual with many, in the Dates of their Letters during that Interval, to &s;et down both the Years thus, as from the 1&s;t of January 1688. to the 25th of March 1689/90</P>
<PB N="29" REF="215">
<P>As for the Natural Day, con&s;i&s;ting of 24 hours, the Engli&s;h begin (as mo&s;t Parts of Europe do) at Midnight, counting 12 hours to Noon the next Day, and 12 hours more to next Midnight; according to the Cu&s;tom of the Egyptians, and ancient Romans. Whereas in &s;ome other Countries, as Italy, Poland, and Bohemia, they reckon 24 hours together, from Sun-&s;et to Sun-&s;et, which mu&s;t needs be very trouble&s;om to tell after the Clock. In Mo&s;covy, and &s;ome Places in Germany (as Nuremberg, and Wirtemberg) they begin the Day and end it with the Sun; &s;o that the fir&s;t Hour of the Day is with them at Sun ri&s;e, and the fir&s;t hour of the Night at Sun-&s;et, which is according to the old Babylonian Account.</P>
<P>The Old Style is u&s;ed in England, as in mo&s;t Prote&s;tant States; and the New Style, in all Popi&s;h States. According to this Style, the&s;e reckon ten Days before us regularly, as to the beginning of Months, and all fixt Fe&s;ti|vals; but for all moveable Fea&s;ts, the Account proves various.</P>
<P>The Old Style is otherwi&s;e called the <HI>Ju|lian Account,</HI> from <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar;</HI> who, 43 Years before our Saviours Birth, ordained the Year to con&s;i&s;t of 365 Days and 6 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ours. And, as the&s;e 6 hours, at 4 Years end, make up 24 hours, therefore a Day is then added to the Month of February; and that Year called Leap Year, or Bi&s;&s;extile Year, from the Latine <HI>Bi&s;&s;extilis.</HI></P>
<P>The New Style is otherwi&s;e termed the <HI>Gre|gorian Account,</HI> from <HI>Pope Gregory XIII;</HI> who, above 100 Years ago, undertook to correct the Calendar, by the advice and direction of Anto|nius Lilius, and other excellent Mathematicians. For, tho the Julian Account for many Ages &s;eemed to have no &s;en&s;ible Errour; yet it was
<PB N="30" REF="216">at la&s;t di&s;covered to be not altogether agree|able with the natural Motion of the Sun. In &s;hort, it was made out, that the Julian Year exceeded the true Solar Year by 10 Minutes and 48 Seconds; whereby the Equinoxes and Sol|&s;tices yearly changed their places, and flew back &s;o many minutes and &s;econds. Therefore Pope Gregory ordered the Year to con&s;i&s;t of 365 Days, 5 hours, 49 minutes, 12 &s;econds. And, that the Vernal Equinox (which then was on the 11th of March) might be reduced to the 21th, as it was at the time of the fir&s;t Nicene Council, he commanded ten Days in October to be left out, by calling the fifth Day thereof the fifteenth.</P>
<P>To find Ea&s;ter, the Church of <HI>England</HI> ob|&s;erves &s;till the Cycle found out and fini&s;hed in the &s;ixth Century by that worthy Roman, <HI>Diony&s;ius Exiguus,</HI> or <HI>Abas.</HI> Whereas the Ro|man Church, having invented new Rules about Ea&s;ter, it happens &s;ometimes that their Ea&s;ter is full five Weeks before ours, &s;ometimes with, but never after ours.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the Engli&s;h Way of Living, as to Lodging, Fewel, Food, Rai|ment, Exerci&s;e, Recreations, and &s;ome particular Cu&s;toms.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHen I compare the Modern Engli&s;h Way of <HI>Building</HI> with the Old Way, I cannot but wonder at the Genius of old Times. Nothing is more delightful and convenient than Light, nothing more agreeable to health than a free Air. And yet of old they u&s;ed to dwell in Hou&s;es, mo&s;t with a blind Stair|ca&s;e, low Cielings, and dark Windows; the Rooms built at random, often with Steps from one to another. So that one would think the Men of former Ages were afraid of Light and good Air, or loved to play at Hide and Seek. Whereas the Genius of our time is altogether for light&s;om Stair-Ca&s;es, fine Sa&s;h-Windows, and lofty Cielings. And &s;uch has been of late our Builders Indu&s;try, in point of Compactne&s;s and Uniformity, that a Hou&s;e after the new Way will afford upon the &s;ame Quantity of Ground as many more Conveniences.</P>
<P>The Contrivance of Clo&s;ets in mo&s;t Rooms, and the painted Wain&s;cotting now &s;o much u|&s;ed, are al&s;o two great Improvements; the one for Conveniency, the other for Cleanne&s;s and Health. And indeed, for &s;o damp a Country as <HI>England</HI> is, nothing could be better contrived
<PB N="32" REF="217">than Wain&s;cot, to keep off the ill Impre&s;&s;ion of damp Walls. In &s;hort, for hand&s;om Accommo|dations and Neatne&s;s of Lodgings, <HI>London</HI> un|doubtedly has got the preeminence.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t Objection again&s;t the London-Hou&s;es (being for the mo&s;t part Brick) is their Slightne&s;s, occa&s;ioned by the Fines exacted by the Landlords. So that few Hou&s;es, at the com|mon rate of Building, la&s;t longer than the Ground-Lea&s;e, that is about 50 or 60 Years. In the mean time, if there happens to be a long fit of exce&s;&s;ive Heat in Summer or Cold in Winter, the Walls being but thin, become at la&s;t &s;o penetrated with the Air, that the Te|nant mu&s;t needs be unea&s;y with it. But tho&s;e Extreams happen but &s;eldom. And this Way of Building is wonderful beneficial to all Trades relating to it; for they never want Work in &s;o great a City, where Hou&s;es here and there are always repairing, or building up again.</P>
<P>The plai&s;tered <HI>Cielings,</HI> &s;o much u&s;ed in <HI>Eng|land</HI> beyond all other Countries, make by their Whitene&s;s the Rooms &s;o much light&s;omer, and are excellent again&s;t a raging Fire. They &s;top the pa&s;&s;age of Du&s;t, and le&s;&s;en the Noi&s;e over|head. In Summer-time the Air of the Room is &s;omething the cooler for't, and the warmer in Winter.</P>
<P>The U&s;e of <HI>Stoves,</HI> &s;o common in Northern Countries, as Germany, Denmark, Sueden, Po|land, and Mo&s;covy, and even &s;o far Southward as Swi&s;&s;erland, is in a manner unknown in this Country. And indeed its Temperatene&s;s does no way require it. Therefore the Engli&s;h u&s;e no outward Remedy again&s;t Cold Weather but a Chimney-Fire, which is both comfortable to the Body, and chearful to the Sight. 'Tis true,
<PB N="33" REF="217">there is a double Conveniency in Stoves. Fir&s;t in point of Savingne&s;s, for once heating of a Stove in the Morning, keeps the Room warm a whole Day. Secondly, in Point of Warmth, the Room being &s;o warm with it, that all Pla|ces in it feel the benefit thereof. But tho&s;e two Conveniences are more than over-ballanced by one Inconveniency, <HI>viz.</HI> the aptne&s;s of Stoves to gather and foment all the noi&s;om Smells of a Room for want of Vent, which mu&s;t needs be very unwhol&s;om; whereas a Chimney-fire draws 'em to it, and there they find vent with the Smoak. To that Inconveniency we may add the chilling Impre&s;&s;ions of a cold and &s;harp Air, upon ones coming into it out of &s;o warm a Room as commonly Stove-rooms are. Be&s;ides the Cumber&s;omne&s;s of Stoves in Summer-time, when being altogether u&s;ele&s;s, they take up a great deal of room to no purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Fewel,</HI> England affords three Sorts, Wood, Coals, and Turves; but Coals is the mo&s;t common, in London e&s;pecially, where they have 'em by Sea from Newca&s;tle and Sun|derland. A la&s;ting &s;ort of Fewel, being a mix|ture of &s;mall and round Coals together, which by their aptne&s;s to cake, is the mo&s;t durable of any; and for Kitchin U&s;e, far beyond Wood it &s;elf, as yielding not only a more even, but more piercing Heat. The Smoak of it is indeed gro&s;&s;er, and of a corro&s;ive nature; but yet no|thing &s;o offen&s;ive to the Eye, whatever it is to the Lungs, as &s;ome pretend it to be. In many Parts of the Country they have Pit-coals, which is a cleaner and more chearful Fewel, but not &s;o durable as Sea-coals. But the Cheapne&s;s of the&s;e at London in Time of Peace is worth ta|king notice; where for &s;o &s;mall a matter as two or three pence a Day one may keep a con&s;tant
<PB N="34" REF="218">moderate Fire from Morning till Bed-time. Which is a mighty Advantage to &s;o va&s;t and populous a Place, e&s;pecially con&s;idering it comes 300 miles by Sea. And whatever the Pari&s;ians can &s;ay to the prai&s;e of their Wood|fires, I dare &s;ay the common &s;ort of People there would be glad, could they compa&s;s it, to change in Winter-time Fewel with the Lon|doners.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h <HI>Diet</HI> falls next under our Con&s;i|deration; which for the eating part, does mo&s;t con&s;i&s;t in Fle&s;h, and chiefly in Butchers Meat. For, though they have great Plenty and Variety of Fi&s;h and Fowl, Roots and Herbs, yet they are mo&s;t commonly u&s;ed but as a Supplement or an Acce&s;&s;ory to the Principal. And there|fore the Engli&s;h ever went among&s;t Strangers for the greate&s;t Fle&s;h-eaters. Which is cer|tainly the be&s;t, and the mo&s;t proper nouri&s;h|ment for this Country.</P>
<P>But, whereas formerly the Engli&s;h u&s;ed to eat three or Four Meals a Day, the generality of them, &s;ince the long Civil Wars in the Reign of Char. I. have u&s;ed them&s;elves to eat but one Meal a Day. If then they eat plentifully, and perhaps beyond the rate of other People, who eat three or four times a Day, it is no matter of amaze|ment. Some thing more than ordinary mu&s;t be laid up in &s;tore, to hold out 24 Hours. There is the le&s;s Time lo&s;t in eating, and the more &s;a|ved for Bu&s;ine&s;s. So that, if other Nations live to eat, the Engli&s;h may be &s;aid to eat only to live. In &s;hort, all things con&s;idered, we may reckon the Engli&s;h, (who heretofore were perhaps not unju&s;tly taxed of Gluttony, and to be a People mo&s;t given to their Bellies) to be now one of the mo&s;t &s;ober Nations of Europe, as to Eating.</P>
<PB N="35" REF="218">
<P>Not but that in their Fea&s;tings, both pub|lick and private, they are as great as any Na|tion. Witne&s;s (for publick ones) the Fea&s;ts at Coronations, at the In&s;tallation of the Knights of the Garter, Con&s;ecration of Bi&s;hops, Inter|tainments of Emba&s;&s;adors, the Fea&s;ts of the Lord Mayor of London, of Sergeants at Law, and of Readers in the Inns of Court. And yet, as &s;umptuous and magnificent as they are in the&s;e Times, they are not to compare to the wonderful Fea&s;tings of elder Times. 'Tis re|corded (&s;ays Dr. <HI>Chamberlain,</HI>) of Richard Earl of Cornwal, Brother to Henry III, that at his Marriage-Fea&s;t he had thirty thou&s;and Di&s;hes of Meat; and that King Richard II, &s;pent dai|ly at a Chri&s;tmas 26 Oxen, and 300 Sheep, be&s;ides Fowl, and all other Provi&s;ion propor|tionably. Anciently, &s;ays <HI>Forte&s;cue,</HI> at a Call of Sergeants at Law, each Sergeant &s;pent 1600 Crowns in Fea&s;ting, which in tho&s;e Days was more than 1600 Pounds now.</P>
<P>But the Civil Wars afore&s;aid are not the on|ly Thing which has brought the Engli&s;h to this Moderation of eating but one Meal a Day. The frequent U&s;e of Tobacco, Tea, and Coffee, has had al&s;o a great hand in it. And the Experi|ence of making but &s;light Suppers, or rather of turning Suppers into Beverages, has proved &s;o conducive to Health, that few People in England make a &s;et Supper. Whereas, beyond Sea, 'tis counted the principal Meal.</P>
<P>The Plainne&s;s of the Engli&s;h Diet is al&s;o very ob&s;ervable in point of Health. Their u&s;ual Way is downright Boiled and Roa&s;ted, without any Sophi&s;tication; and 'tis certainly the mo&s;t agree|able to ones Health. The French Kick&s;haws are meer Kitchin Sophi&s;try, invented more toplea&s;e a curious Palate, than to &s;atisfy a natural Appetite.
<PB N="36" REF="219">Their Cooks meer Legerdemains. You take one thing for another, the proper Ta&s;te of the Meat is gone, and another by the virtue of <HI>Co|quus Pocus</HI> is &s;ub&s;tituted: Thus the Palate is gra|tified, and the Stomack cheated. 'Tis true, the dainty Frenchified Palates in England love this kind of Tran&s;migration; but tho&s;e who are for Variety, may find here pretty Knacks enough, without running to France for it. For Pa&s;try no Nation excels the Engli&s;h, but in Veni&s;on-Pa&s;ties they excel all Nations.</P>
<P>But if we go from the Kitchin to the Butte|ry, here indeed the Engli&s;h Butler does outdo the French Cook in point of Variety. Be&s;ides the Diver&s;ity of Wines from abroad, from the Ea&s;t and from the South, here we find Beer and Ale, &s;mall and &s;trong of both &s;orts; and of the la&s;t twenty Species, all noted for &s;ome peculiar quality, mo&s;t for their &s;trength. Nothing plea|&s;anter than this to the Eye, or to the Palate, when skill and age has brought it to perfection; but nothing more treacherous. It goes down gently and palatably; but, as if it were too no|ble a Liquor for tho&s;e lower Parts, it pre&s;ently flyes up to the Head, and puts all there in a con|fu&s;ion. So quick is the Operation of tho&s;e &s;trong &s;orts of Liquors, upon too large a Do&s;e, that they run a Man out of his Sen&s;es, before he can have an Interval of Mirth. I &s;peak of Men that are not &s;o well u&s;ed to tho&s;e &s;orts of Liquors as the North Country Men are, who know be&s;t how to deal with them.</P>
<P>But, be&s;ides the Variety of Wines from a|broad, of Beer and Ale brewed at home, here is drunk abundance of Sider, Perry, Mead, Me|theglin, Mum, and &s;ince the Plague, French Brandy, and Iri&s;h U&s;quebach: two dangerous &s;orts of Drink, when taken immoderately. To con|clude,
<PB N="37" REF="219">I wi&s;h I could &s;ay the Engli&s;h are as &s;o|ber in point of Drinking, as they are in their Eating. But, &s;ince <HI>Scaliger's</HI> Time, they have in a great mea&s;ure clubbed with the Germans, their old Kinred, in the Character he gives of the&s;e in one of his Epigrams.</P>
<Q><L>Tres &s;unt Convivae, <HI>Germanus, Flander,</HI> &amp; <HI>Anglus;</HI></L>
<L>Dic quis edat meli&ugrave;s, quis meli&ugrave;&s;ve bibat.</L>
<L>Non comedis, <HI>Germane,</HI> bibis; tu non bibis <HI>Angle,</HI></L>
<L>Sed comedis; comedis <HI>Flandre,</HI> bibi&s;que bene.</L></Q>
<P>In Engli&s;h thus.
<Q><L><HI>Dutch, Flemings, Engli&s;h,</HI> are your only Gue&s;ts;</L>
<L>Say which of all do's eat, or drink it be&s;t.</L>
<L>Th' <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> love mo&s;t to eat, the <HI>Dutch</HI> to &s;will,</L>
<L>Only the <HI>Fleming</HI> eats and drinks his fill.</L></Q></P>
<P>Thus was it in <HI>Scaliger's</HI> time with the Eng|li&s;h Nation. But now the Ca&s;e is altered, &s;o far at lea&s;t as concerns the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who are at this time le&s;s Eaters, but more addicted to Drinking than formerly; and yet not to that exce&s;s neither generally, as the Germans are.</P>
<P>The U&s;e of Coffee and Tea, two &s;ober Li|quours now &s;o prevalent in England, do's take off people con&s;iderably from drinking of &s;trong Liquours. And, were it but for that, the Coffee-hou&s;es ought to be kept up and in|couraged.</P>
<P>Now Coffee is made with the berries of a Tree that grows in the Levant, and Tea with the leaves of an India Plant; both hot and dry, and therefore very proper for Phleg|matick people. And, whereas &s;trong Liquours
<PB N="38" REF="220">are apt to di&s;order the Brain, the&s;e on the contrary do &s;ettle and compo&s;e it. Which makes it &s;o much u&s;ed by Men of Learning and Bu&s;ine&s;s, who know be&s;t the virtue of 'em.</P>
<P>As for Tobacco, the U&s;e whereof is indeed more univer&s;al, 'tis a Remedy for phlegmatick people, and con&s;equently not ami&s;s in this Country. Tis a Companion in Solitude, an Amu&s;ement in Company, an innocent Diver|&s;ion to Melancholy, and a Help to Fancy in private Studies and Meditations.</P>
<P>I come now to the Engli&s;h Wearing <HI>Apparel,</HI> wherein this Nation has &s;hewed in former Ages much Pride and Levity. So fooli&s;h and ex|travagant they were, &s;o &s;uperfluous and ob&s;cene, that divers Statutes were made again&s;t that Ex|ce&s;s, even before the Reformation. Then an Engli&s;h-man was wont to be pictured naked, with a pair of Sheers in his hand, a piece of Cloth under his Arm, and Ver&s;es annext, in|timating that he knew not what fa&s;hion of Cloaths to have. In Q. Elizabeths Time, &s;ometimes they took up the German, and &s;ometimes the Spani&s;h Mode. But the French Fa&s;hion has prevailed for the mo&s;t part &s;ince. Only there was a Time in King Charles the &s;e|cond his Reign, that is, about 23 Years &s;ince, when Men took up a grave &s;ort of Habit, &s;ome|thing like that of the Oriental Nations. But it was &s;oon laid a&s;ide, and the French Mode taken up again, which has continued ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>Cloth, among&s;t Men, is the general and al|mo&s;t the only Wear. And that with &s;o much plainne&s;s and comeline&s;s, with &s;o much mo|de&s;ty and &s;o little prodigality, that the Eng|li&s;h,
<PB N="39" REF="220">formerly &s;o api&s;h in imitating forein Na|tions in their Garb, might go now for a Model. The Women indeed, who value them|&s;elves mo&s;t upon a fine outward Appearance, cannot keep within tho&s;e Bounds. Whether it be to make a Figure in the World, or out of Emulation among&s;t them&s;elves, or out of De&s;ign upon Men, they go &s;till in rich Silks, with all the Set-offs that Art can po&s;&s;ibly invent from time to time. They know that Love do's love Toys, and that Men love to be caught in a fine Net. And herein the Citizens Wives, and Maid-Servants, do run into &s;uch Exce&s;s as makes a Confu&s;ion. So hard it is &s;ometimes to know a Trade&s;mans Wife from a Lady, or the Maid from the Mi&s;tris.</P>
<P>As for the Engli&s;h <HI>Exerci&s;es</HI> and <HI>Recreations,</HI> &s;ome they have common with other Nations, as Hunting, Hawking, Fowling, Fi&s;hing, Tennis, Bowling, Shooting at Bow and Arrows, Leap|ing, Wre&s;tling, Dancing, Mu&s;ick, Stage-Plays, Operas, Ma&s;carades, Balls, Ballets, &amp;c. A|mong&s;t which their Way of Bowling in fine Greens, contrived and kept for that purpo&s;e, is beyond any Thing that forein Countries do afford. Wre&s;tling is an Exerci&s;e, wherein they have a peculiar Skill, but chiefly the North and We&s;tern People. Their Mu&s;ick, like their Temper, inclines to gravity. And, if France outdo's the Engli&s;h in Comedies, England may be &s;aid to outdo all Europe in Trage|dies.</P>
<P>But, be&s;ides tho&s;e Exerci&s;es and Recrea|tions u&s;ual with other Nations, they have &s;ome more peculiar to them&s;elves; &s;uch as Paddock-Cour&s;es, Hor&s;e-races, Cock-fighting, Bear-baiting, Bull-baiting, Prizes, Cudgels,
<PB N="40" REF="221">Foot-ball, Throwing at Cocks, and their Way of Ringing of Bells. Among&s;t which the Races &s;hew the Swiftne&s;s of Engli&s;h Hor&s;es brought up for that purpo&s;e, which to Fo|reiners unacquainted with it go's almo&s;t for a Romance. Cock-fighting &s;hews the Courage of their Cocks; Bear-baiting, and Bull-baiting that of their Dogs; and Prizes, the dexterity of &s;ome Men in handling of Weapons, tho' with &s;ome effu&s;ion of Bloud. Foot ball is a rude Diver&s;ion for the common &s;ort of People in fro&s;ty Weather. Throwing at Cocks is not only rude, but cruel. And, as to the Mu|&s;ical Way of Ringing the Bells in England, the frequency of it makes it rather a Recrea|tion to the Ringers than others.</P>
<P>The Publick Days for Fea&s;ting, among&s;t the Engli&s;h, are fir&s;t the Holy Daies at Chri&s;tmas, Ea&s;ter, and Whit&s;untide, but chiefly Chri&s;t|mas Holy-Days: When 'tis u&s;ual for Landlords to treat their Tenants, for Relations and Friends to invite each other, and pa&s;s the Time in Merriments. And, though tho&s;e Holy-Days are not kept of late Years with that Profu&s;ene&s;s as formerly they were; yet I could wi&s;h they were kept with more devo|tion, and le&s;s intemporatene&s;s.</P>
<P>From All-Saints Day to Candlemas, 'tis u&s;ual for each Inn of Court to have Revels on Holy-Days, that is, Mu&s;ick and Dancing; and for this they chu&s;e &s;ome young Student to be Ma&s;ter of the Revels. Before Chri&s;tmas, the Students, who are for the mo&s;t part Gentle|men of quality that come hither only to learn &s;o much Law as may &s;erve their turn to pre|&s;erve their E&s;tates, meet together in order to keep a &s;olemn Chri&s;tmas. At this Meeting, which they call a Parliament, Officers are
<PB N="41" REF="221">cho&s;en from among them to bear Rule in the Hou&s;e during the whole Chri&s;tmas; as a Com|ptroller, Trea&s;urer, &amp;c. Sometimes, when their publick Trea&s;ury can reach it, they make a Prince among them&s;elves, who keeps a Court accordingly. By whom many of the chief Nobility and great Officers of State are fea&s;ted, and intertained with Interludes, &amp;c.</P>
<P>But, whether a Prince or no, the whole Chri&s;tmas-time (except Sundays) is devoted here to Fea&s;ting, Mu&s;ick, Dancing, and Di|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing. This la&s;t, being allowed to all Comers, is &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, that the Box-mony do's u&s;ually amount to about 50 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> each 24 hours. Which Mony go's a great way towards the defraying the Charges of the whole Chri&s;tmas, the re&s;t being made up by a Contribution from each Student.</P>
<P>But, be&s;ides Chri&s;tmas Holy-Days (which may be called the Carnaval of England) there are other Days of publick Rejoycing. As, the King and Queens Birth and Coronation-Days; the pre&s;ent Kings Birth-Day being the 4th of November, the Queens the 30th of April, and their Coronation Day April the 11th.</P>
<P>The 5th of November, being Gun-powder Trea&s;on Day, when the Popi&s;h Con&s;pirators had prepared all Things to blow up King James I. and his Parliament then &s;itting, is a Day of Thank&s;giving, &s;olemnly kept to the eternal Confu&s;ion of Popery. This is the Day, when the Pope, by way of Reta|liation, u&s;ed &s;olemnly to be burnt in Effigie at Temple-Bar in King Charles the Seconds Time, with &s;o much State and Pomp, that the Undertakers &s;pared for nothing to have it
<PB N="42" REF="222">done &s;utable to the Subject. But, this being di&s;continued, &s;ince the late King came to the Crown, and being lookt upon be&s;ides by &s;ober people as a Piece of Exorbitancy, I have done with it, and hope it won't be renew|ed.</P>
<P>My Lord Mayors Day, being the 29th of October, is al&s;o a &s;olemn Day of publick Re|joycing and Fea&s;ting for the City of London. Societies have likewi&s;e their Fea&s;ting Days, when they meet in a Body, either upon the Election of a new Officer, or on &s;ome other account. But, of all the Societies, there is none to be compared in this point to the Inns of Court, for &s;tate and magnificence.</P>
<P>As to private Families, 'tis u&s;ual with many to celebrate their Birth and Marriage-Days with their mo&s;t intimate Friends.</P>
<P>To improve Society, the life of Recreation, the Engli&s;h have, be&s;ides their u&s;ual and friend|ly Meetings called <HI>Clubs,</HI> the Conveniency of <HI>Coffee-Hou&s;es,</HI> more common here than any where el&s;e. In the&s;e all Comers intermix together, with mutual freedom; and, at the &s;mall Charge of a peny or two pence of &s;uch Liquours as are &s;old there, Men have the Op|portunity of meeting together, and getting Acquaintance, with choice of Conver&s;ation, and the advantage of reading all forein and do|me&s;tick News.</P>
<P><HI>S. Bartholomew</HI>'s (vulgarly called <HI>Bartelmy</HI>) Fair is a particular Time for Diver&s;ion to the City of London. It begins on S. Bartholo|mew's Day the 24th of Augu&s;t, and conti|nues 14 Days in We&s;t-Smithfield; at the end whereof it removes for &s;o many Days more to Southwark, on the other &s;ide of the River. Then is the dead Time of the Year, which
<PB N="43" REF="222">among&s;t Citizens is the mo&s;t proper for their Diver&s;ion. This Fair is famous, not &s;o much for Things bought or &s;old, as for its great Variety of Shews, either of Nature or Art. So that one may apply to it what the Romans of old u&s;ed to &s;ay of Africk, <HI>Quid novi fert Africa?</HI> For here is always to be &s;een &s;trange &s;orts of living Creatures. And for &s;uch as love Feats of Activity, Comical, or Tragical Shews, here they are to be &s;een in the utmo&s;t per|&s;ection. Which draws daily during the Fair a great Concour&s;e of people, to the benefit of the Shewers and the &s;atisfaction of the Be|holders.</P>
<P>And now, among&s;t the Engli&s;h particular <HI>Cu&s;toms,</HI> I &s;hall in the fir&s;t place take notice of their Way of Pledging one another, where|of this is the Original. When the Danes Lorded it over England, they u&s;ed, when the Engli&s;h drank, to &s;tab them, or cut their Throats. To avoid which Villany, the Party then drinking reque&s;ted &s;ome of the next to him to be his Surety or Pledge, for his Life. From whence came the Expre&s;&s;ion u&s;ed to this day of Pledging one another, when the Party drunk to takes his turn, and drinks next after him.</P>
<P>Another Cu&s;tom the Engli&s;h had formerly upon the Danes account; which Time has &s;o corrupted, that there remains no &s;ign of the fir&s;t In&s;titution, except in the Name <HI>Hock-tide,</HI> an old Saxon Word, which &s;ignify's the Time of Scorning, or Triumphing. The Eng|li&s;h, in the Reign of King Ethelred, were &s;o oppre&s;&s;ed and broken by the Danes, that E|thelred was fain to buy his Peace of them at the yearly Tribute of 10000 pound, &s;oon af|ter
<PB N="44" REF="223">inhaunced to 48000, which Monies were rai&s;ed upon the Subjects by the Name of <HI>Dane|gelt.</HI> But the King, weary of this Exaction, plotted with his Subjects to kill all the Danes, as they &s;lept in their Beds. Which was ac|cordingly done on <HI>S. Brice</HI>'s Night, <HI>Nov.</HI> 12.1012. The joyfull Engli&s;h, having thus clear|ed their Country of the Danes, in&s;tituted the annual Sports of <HI>Hock tide;</HI> in Imitation of the Romans <HI>Fugalia,</HI> at the expul&s;ion of their Kings. This Solemnity con&s;i&s;ted in the merry Meerings of the Neighbours in tho&s;e Days during which the Fe&s;tival la&s;ted, and was ce|lebrated by the younger &s;ort of both Sexes, with all manner of Exerci&s;es and Pa&s;times in the Streets. At Coventry they yearly acted a Play called <HI>Hock-Tue&s;day,</HI> till Q. Elizabeths Time.</P>
<P>The 14th of February, being <HI>S. Valentines</HI> Day, has been kept Time out of mind, (and is &s;o to this day) both by the Engli&s;h and Scots, with &s;ome relation to the In&s;tinct of Animals. For Nature teaches us, that about this time of the Year the Bea&s;ts of the Field and Fowls of the Air feeling a new heat by the approach of the Sun, the Males chu&s;e their Females, and begin to couple. From whence it is probable young Men and Maidens took occa&s;ion to meet together at this time to an equal Number; and, having their re&s;pective Names writ down &s;everally upon pieces of paper rolled up, the Men draw the Maidens Names, and the&s;e the Mens. So the Lot gives every Man a She Valentine, and every Maid a He one; the Men wearing their Lots for &s;ome Days rolled up about their Hat-bands, and the Women before their Brea&s;t. Where|upon they make each other a Pre&s;ent, and
<PB N="45" REF="223">&s;ometimes it comes to be a Match in good earne&s;t.</P>
<P>The&s;e Particulars, &s;o well known to the whole Nation, I would not have in&s;i&s;ted up|on, but for the &s;atisfaction of Foreiners. Up|on who&s;e Account I &s;hall likewi&s;e explain, but in few Words, the Story of the Wel&s;h Cu&s;tom of wearing Leeks on their Hats the fir&s;t day of March, being S. David's Day. Once upon a time (to u&s;e the old Engli&s;h Style) the Wel&s;h Liberty lay grievou&s;ly at &s;take; and they mu&s;t either be victorious, or lo&s;e it. In that Extremity they called for help upon S. David, their Patron. Armed with Confidence in that Saint, they cro&s;&s;ed Fields &s;owed with Leeks, before they came to ingage; and, for di&s;tinction &s;ake, each Soul|dier took up a Leek. The Wel&s;h got the Vi|ctory; and, to perpetuate the Memory thereof, as well as out of re&s;pect to the Saint, they made a Law among&s;t them&s;elves, that on S. David's Day every Man &s;hould wear a Leek about his Head. Which is religiou&s;ly by them ob&s;erved every Year; the common people wearing but Garden Leeks, and the better &s;ort wrought ones. The King him&s;elf, out of Complacency to that People, wears one upon that Day.</P>
<P>The Scots, on their fide, wear a blue Cro&s;s on the fore-part of their Hats upon S. An|drew's Day, their Patron. And the Iri&s;h a red Cro&s;s on one &s;ide of their Hats, to the Me|mory of their old Patron, S. Patrick.</P>

<P>IV. <HI>Of the great Trade of Eng|land, in foreign Parts.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>BE&s;ides the Conveniency of <HI>Travelling</HI> by Water, either by Sea, or here and there upon Rivers, I may &s;ay the Engli&s;h Na|tion is the be&s;t provided of any for Land-Tra|vel, as to Hor&s;es and Coaches. And the Truth is, there is not perhaps a Country &s;o proper for't, 'tis generally &s;o open and level.</P>
<P>Travelling on Hor&s;eback is &s;o common a Thing in England, that the meane&s;t &s;ort of People u&s;e it as well as the re&s;t. Which &s;ome|times fills the Roads with Riders, not without frequent Di&s;putes about giving the way, which is unu&s;ual beyond Sea. And, as Engli&s;h Hor&s;es are the be&s;t for Expedition, &s;o 'tis rare upon the Road to &s;ee an Engli&s;hman but upon the Gallop.</P>
<P>But for Per&s;ons that are tender, or di&s;abled, England excels all other Nations in the Con|veniency of Coaches, but e&s;pecially in that of
<PB N="47" REF="224">Stage-Coaches; a very commodious and ea&s;y Way of Travelling. Here one may be tran&s;|ported without over-violent Motion, and &s;hel|tered from the Injuries of the Air, to mo&s;t no|ted Places in England. With &s;o much &s;peed, that &s;ome of the&s;e Coaches will reach above 50 Miles in a Summer Day; and at &s;o ea&s;y Rates, that it is in &s;ome Places le&s;s than a Shil|ling for every Five Miles.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Po&s;t,</HI> for Intercour&s;e of Letters, there is a general Office in the City of London, from whence Letters and Pacquets are di&s;patch|ed to all Parts, and the Returns according to their re&s;pective Directions.</P>
<P>This Office, now in Lombard-&s;treet London, is managed in chief by the Po&s;t-ma&s;ter General, who is con&s;tituted thereto by the King's Let|ters Patents under the Great Seal of England, who&s;e Place is counted to be worth 2000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> a Year. Under him he has a Deputy, and other Officers to a great Number, who give their actual attendance re&s;pectively in the Di&s;patch of Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Upon this General Po&s;t-Office depends 182 Deputy Po&s;t-Ma&s;ters in England and Scotland; mo&s;t of which keep regular Offices in their Stages, and Sub-Po&s;t Ma&s;ters in their Branches. So that there is no con&s;iderable Market-Town but has an ea&s;y and certain. Conveyance for Letters to and from the &s;aid Po&s;t Office in the due Cour&s;e of the Mails every Po&s;t.</P>
<P>There are Weekly three general Po&s;t Days to &s;end from London to any Part of <HI>England, Wales, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> viz. Tue&s;day, Thur&s;day, and Saturday. The Returns certain upon Mundays, Wedne&s;days, or Fridays; ex|cept
<PB N="48" REF="225" MS="y"><HI>Ireland,</HI> from whence the Return is not &s;o certain, by rea&s;on of the Sea.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Kent</HI> and the <HI>Downs,</HI> the Po&s;t goes thi|ther from London every Day of the Week, ex|cept Sundays.</P>

<P>Now for the Conveniency of the Londoners that live far from the Po&s;t-Office, there are particular Po&s;t-Hou&s;es from Place to Place ap|pointed to take in the Letters, to be tran&s;mit|ted from thence in due time to the General Po&s;t-Office.</P>
<P>By what is &s;aid, it may ea&s;ily be gue&s;&s;ed in general, that the Charge of the Po&s;t-Office is infinitely great. But the Return of it to the King does &s;o much over-ballance it, that this Office yields to his Maje&s;ty yearly about Fifty thou&s;and pounds, all Charges born.</P>
<P>Another U&s;e of this excellent Conveniency is in relation to Travellers, who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s re|quires expedition.

<P>Formerly all Engli&s;h <HI>Coyns</HI> were coyned or &s;tamp'd by Hammers; but, &s;ince the Re&s;taura|tion of King Charles II, a new Way of Stamp|ing by a Mill or Screw was found out, and fol|lowed ever &s;ince.

<P>But, be&s;ides the fore&s;aid Officers, there is the Provo&s;t of the Company of Moneyers, the King's chief Clerk, and four other Clerks for the Receipt Office, the Melters and Smiths, the Blanchers, Moulders, Labourers, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The <HI>Weights</HI> and <HI>Mea&s;ures</HI> ought to be by Magna Charta, the &s;ame all over England, that is, according to the King's Standard kept in the Exchequer by the Clerk (or Comptroller) of the Market.</P>
<P>The <HI>Weights</HI> now u&s;ed throughout all Eng|land are of two &s;orts, the one called <HI>Troy-Weight,</HI> and the other <HI>Avoir du pois;</HI> the fir&s;t containing 12 Ounces, and the other 16 in the Pound. But then the Ounce <HI>Avoir du pois</HI> is lighter than the <HI>Ounce Troy</HI> by almo&s;t a 12th part.

<P>By the <HI>Troy-Weight</HI> are weighed Pearls, pre|cious-Stones, Gold, Silver, Bread, all manner of Corn and Grain; and this Weight the Apo|thecaries do or ought to u&s;e. By <HI>Avoir du pois</HI> are weighed all Grocery Ware, Fle&s;h, Butter, Chee&s;e, Iron, Hemp, Flax, Tallow, Wax, Lead,
<PB N="53" REF="227">Steel, and all things whereof comes Wa&s;te. In con&s;ideration whereof 112 Pound <HI>Avoir du pois</HI> goes to a Hundred-Weight, and proportio|nably 56 pound to half a Hundred, and 28 to a Quarter, or Tod. A Stone among&s;t Lon|don Butchers makes 8 pounds of this Weight, but in the Country 'tis for the mo&s;t part 14.</P>
<P>In <HI>Troy-Weight</HI> 20 Grains make a Scruple, thus marked &scruple;, 3 Scruples a Drachm &dram;, 8 Drachms an Ounce &ounce;, and 12 Ounces a Pound <ABBR>lb.</ABBR> In <HI>Avoir du pois Weight,</HI> 16 Drachms make an Ounce, 16 Ounces a Pound, 28 Pound a Quar|ter, 4 Quarters a Hundred, and 20 Hundred a Tun.</P>
<P>In <HI>Troy Weight,</HI> 24 Grains of Wheat make a Peny-Weight Sterling, 20 Peny-Weights an Ounce, and 12 Ounces a Pound. And, when Wheat is at 5 Shillings the Bu&s;hel, the Peny Wheaten Loaf is then by Statute to weigh 11 Ounces Troy, and three half Peny White Loaves to weigh as much. But the Hou&s;hold Peny-Loaf is to weigh 14 Troy Ounces, and two thirds.</P>
<P>As for the Weight called <HI>Venice-Ounce</HI> u&s;ed here, as in other Countries by Silk-men, there is no Standard of it, nor is it allowed by Law. This Ounce being but 13 Peny Weight and 12 Grains, it falls out that 12 Ounces <HI>Venice</HI> is but 8 Ounces 4 peny <HI>Troy,</HI> and 9 Ounces <HI>Avoir du pois.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mea&s;ares</HI> are either Applicative, or Recep|tive, that is, &s;uch as Things are mea&s;ured by out|wardly, or inwardly.</P>

<P>Now an <HI>Acre</HI> of Land in England con&s;i&s;ts of 40 Perches in length, and 4 in breadth; a <HI>Yard-Land,</HI> commonly of 30 Acres; and an <HI>Hide</HI> of Land of 100 Acres.</P>
<P>The Receptive <HI>Mea&s;ure</HI> is two-fold, that is, either for liquid, or dry Things. For Liquid, as a <HI>Pint,</HI> which is &s;ubdivided into le&s;&s;er Parts, as <HI>half a Pint,</HI> a <HI>Quartern</HI> or quarter of a Pint. Now 2 Pints make a <HI>Quart,</HI> 2 Quarts a <HI>Pottle,</HI> 2 Pottles a <HI>Gallon,</HI> 8 Gallons a <HI>Firkin</HI> of Ale, and 9 a <HI>Firkin</HI> of Beer. Two Firkins of either &s;ort make a <HI>Kilderkin,</HI> and 2 Kilderkins a <HI>Bar|rel.</HI> But &s;till the Difference in the Number of <HI>Gallons</HI> as to Beer and Ale ought to be minded and allowed. For, as a Kilderkin of Beer con|tains 18 Gallons, and one of Ale but 16; &s;o a Barrel of Beer being double a Kilderkin, con|tains 36 Gallons, and one of Ale but 32.</P>
<P>Now a Barrel and a half of Beer (being 54 Gallons) make a <HI>Hog&s;head,</HI> 2 Hog&s;hheads a <HI>Pipe</HI> or <HI>Butt,</HI> and 2 Pipes a <HI>Tun.</HI></P>
<P>Note, that a Barrel of Butter or Soap is the &s;ame with a Barrel of Ale.</P>
<P>As for Wine-Mea&s;ures, they fall &s;o much &s;hort of tho&s;e of Ale and Beer, that Four Gal|lons
<PB N="55" REF="228">of the&s;e make Five Gallous of Wine mea|&s;ure. Thus they hold proportion as four to five. Of the&s;e Gallons a <HI>Rundlet</HI> of Wine holds 18, <HI>half a Hog&s;head</HI> 31 and a half, a <HI>Tierce</HI> 42, a <HI>Hog&s;head</HI> 63, a <HI>Punchion</HI> 84, a <HI>Pipe</HI> or <HI>Butt</HI> 126, a <HI>Tun</HI> 252.</P>
<P>For dry Things, &s;uch as Corn or Grain, there is fir&s;t the <HI>Gallon,</HI> of a fize between the Wine and the Beer Gallon.

<P>To conclude now with the <HI>Great Trade of England</HI> to Foreign Parts, be&s;ides the &s;everal Companies I have took notice of in my De|&s;cription of London, there are other <HI>Compa|nies</HI> or Societies of Merchants, e&s;tabli&s;hed for the promoting or incouraging of foreign Trade. Which have Power and Immunities granted them to make Acts and Orders, for the benefit of Commerce in general, and of their Compa|nies in particular. Such are among&s;t others, the <HI>Company of Merchant Adventurers,</HI> the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia, Turky,</HI> and <HI>Ea&s;t-India Companies,</HI> and the <HI>Royal African Company.</HI> Be&s;ides the <HI>Spani&s;h, French, Ea&s;t-Land,</HI> and <HI>Greenland Companies,</HI> and the <HI>Company trading to Hud&s;on's Bay,</HI> the Priviledges and Trade of which la&s;t were lately confirmed by Act of Parliament.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t being the <HI>Company of Merchant Ad|venturers,</HI> is the mo&s;t ancient of all, having had their Original in the Reign of Edward I, and their Continuance ever &s;ince. Grounded at fir&s;t upon the Exportation of Wool only, be|ing the prime and &s;taple Commodity of Eng|land; &s;ince converted into Cloathing, and now including all manner of Drapery. This Com|pany
<PB N="56" REF="229">is managed in England by a Governour, Deputy, and certain A&s;&s;i&s;tants; beyond Sea, by a Deputy, and certain A&s;&s;i&s;tants.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia Company</HI> had their Beginning in the Reign of Edward VI, upon the Di&s;covery made by the Engli&s;h of the North-Ea&s;t Pa&s;&s;age to Archangel, whereby they opened a great Trade in the Dominions of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">zars of Mo&s;covy, removed hither from Narva up|on the Baltick. Their Charter was after|wards confirmed and inlarged by Queen Eliza|beth.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turky-Merchants,</HI> otherwi&s;e called the <HI>Levant Company,</HI> from their Trade in the Levant, was Incorporated by Queen Elizabeth, and had their Charter Confirmed and Inlarged by King James I.</P>
<P>But the greate&s;t and mo&s;t eminent Compa|ny is that which manages the <HI>Ea&s;t-India Trade,</HI> which begun likewi&s;e in Queen Elizabeths Time, Anno 1600. For the Managing whereof, they imploy a joint Stock, and have a great Hou&s;e in Leaden-Hall-Street, called the Ea&s;t-India Hou&s;e. By which Trade and Stock they have built a great Number of War-like Ships, and brought hither tho&s;e Indian Commodities which be|fore were brought to us by the Portugueze, being the fir&s;t Di&s;coverers of the Ea&s;t-India Pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>So that by the Ea&s;t-India and the Levant Companies, England, and many other Countries by their &s;econd Tran&s;portation, have ever &s;ince been &s;upplied with tho&s;e Rich Merchandizes which <HI>Italy, Turky, Arabia, Per&s;ia, India,</HI> and <HI>China</HI> yield; where they have their re&s;pective Agents. On the Coa&s;t of <HI>Coromandel</HI> is the <HI>Fort St. George,</HI> belonging to the Ea&s;t-India Company, where they have a Pre&s;ident of all
<PB N="57" REF="229">the Factories on that Coa&s;t, and of the Bay of <HI>Bengala.</HI></P>
<P>As to the <HI>Royal African Company,</HI> King Charles II was plea&s;ed by his Letters Patents, to grant them a Liberty of Trading all along the We&s;tern Coa&s;ts of Africk, from Cape Vert as far as the Cape of good Hope, with prohibition of Tra|ding there to all his other Subjects. At <HI>Cape-Coa&s;t</HI> is the Re&s;idence of the chief Agent of the Company, where they have a &s;trong Place or Fort.</P>
<P>I pa&s;s by the other Companies, though &s;ome of them very con&s;iderable; and the great Trade of the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> generally managed by Mer|chants not Incorporated. Only I &s;hall add, that every Company has the Priviledge to govern them&s;elves by &s;etled Acts and Orders, under &s;uch Governours, Deputies, A&s;&s;i&s;tants, and A|gents as they think fit to chu&s;e among them|&s;elves. And this way has been found to be &s;o profitable and beneficial, by Exporting the na|tive Commodities thereof, by &s;etting the Poor on Work, by building of many brave Ships, and by Importing hither of forein Commodities both for U&s;e and Ornament, that the Benefit accruing thereby to the&s;e Nations cannot be expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The principal Commodities exported from hence into forein Countries are Woollen Cloths of all &s;orts, broad and narrow, the Engli&s;h be|ing now the be&s;t Cloth-Workers in the World. To which add <HI>Sattins, Tabies, Velvets, Plu&s;hes,</HI> and infinite other <HI>Manufactures;</HI> &s;ome of which make very good Returns from the foreign Plan|tations.</P>
<P>Abundance of <HI>Tin, Lead, Alum, Copper, Iron, Fullers Earth, Salt,</HI> and <HI>Sea-Coal,</HI> of mo&s;t &s;orts of <HI>Grains,</HI> but <HI>Wheat</HI> e&s;pecially, of <HI>Skins</HI> and

<P>From whence the Merchants make good Re|turns, and bring a great deal of Trea&s;ure and rich Commodities, to the Inriching of them|&s;elves, the un&s;peakable benefit of the Nation, and the Credit of the Engli&s;h in general. Who are as indu&s;trious and active, as fair Dealers, and great Undertakers as any Nation in the World.</P>
<P>For, though the Hollanders perhaps do drive a greater Trade, 'tis neither for want of Stock, nor for want of Indu&s;try, on the &s;ide of the Engli&s;h. The Hollanders, being &s;queezed as they are within the narrow Bounds of their Coun|try, find little or no Land to purcha&s;e, with the Returns of their Trade. This puts 'em upon a kind of Nece&s;&s;ity of improving &s;till their Stock, and of &s;ending back tho&s;e Riches a float|ing upon the Sea which they cannot fix on the Land. Whereas our Engli&s;h Merchants having the Opportunity of Injoying the Fruits of their Indu&s;try, in a &s;pacious, delicate, fruitful Coun|try, by purcha&s;ing E&s;tates for them&s;elves and Families, are apt to yield to the Temptation, and to exchange the hurry of Trade for the plea&s;ures of a Country-life.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the Engli&s;h Laws, and Religion.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Laws of England are of &s;everal Sorts, and &s;everally u&s;ed according to the Subject.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t there is the <HI>Common Law,</HI> that is, the Common Cu&s;toms of the Nation, which have by length of time obtained the force of Laws. This is the Summary of the Laws of the Sax|ons and Danes, fir&s;t reduced into one Body by King Edward the Elder, about the Year 900. Which, for &s;ome time being lo&s;t, were revived by King Edward the Confe&s;&s;or, and by Po&s;terity named his Laws. To the&s;e William the Conquerour having added &s;ome of the good Cu&s;toms of Normandy, he cau&s;ed them all to be written in his own Norman Dialect; which, being no where vulgarly u&s;ed, varies no more than the Latine. Therefore to this day all Reports, Pleadings, and Law-Exerci&s;es, Declarations upon Original Writs, and all Records are written in the old Nor|man.</P>
<P>But where the Common Law falls &s;hort, the <HI>Statute Law</HI> makes it up. Which are the Laws made from time to time by King and Par|liament.</P>
<P>The <HI>Civil Law,</HI> which is counted the Law of Nations, is peculiarly made u&s;e of in all Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Courts, in the Court of Ad|miralty,
<PB N="60" REF="231">in That of the Earl Mar&s;hal, in Trea|ties with forein Princes, and la&s;tly in the Two Univer&s;ities of the Land.</P>
<P>The <HI>Canon-Law,</HI> otherwi&s;e called the Eccle|&s;ia&s;tical Laws, takes place in Things that meer|ly relate to Religion. This Law comprehends the Canons of many ancient General Councils, of many National and Provincial Engli&s;h Sy|nods, divers Decrees of the Bi&s;hops of Rome, and Judgments of ancient Fathers, received by the Church of England, and incorporated into the Body of the Canon Law. By which &s;he did ever proceed in the Exerci&s;e of her Juri&s;diction, and do's &s;till by virtue of an Act in the Reign of Henry VIII, &s;o far as the &s;aid Canons and Con&s;titutions are not repugnant to the Holy Scripture, to the Kings Preroga|tive, or the Laws of this Realm. But, where|as Temporal Laws inflict Puni&s;hment upon the Body, the&s;e properly concern the Soul of Man. And, as they differ in &s;everal Ends, &s;o they differ in &s;everal Proceedings.</P>
<P>The <HI>Martial Law</HI> reaches none but Souldiers and Mariners, and is not to be u&s;ed but in time of actual War. But the late King, who ran headlong to Arbitrary Power, made nothing of violating this, and mo&s;t other Laws.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fore&s;t-Law</HI> concerns the Fore&s;ts, and in flicts Puni&s;hment on tho&s;e that tre&s;pa&s;s up|on them. By virtue of this Law, the Will is reputed for the Fact; &s;o that, if a Man be taken hunting a Deer, he may be Arre&s;ted as if he had taken it.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, there are <HI>Municipal Laws,</HI> common|ly called <HI>Peculiar</HI> (or <HI>By</HI>) <HI>Laws,</HI> proper to Corporations. The&s;e are the Laws which the Magi&s;trates of a Town or City, by virtue of the King's Charter, have a Power to make for
<PB N="61" REF="231">the benefit and advantage of their Corpora|tion; Provided always, that the &s;ame be not repugnant to the Laws of the Land. The&s;e By-Laws properly bind none but the Inhabi|tants of the Place, unle&s;s they be for publick Good, or to avoid a publick Inconvenience. In which Ca&s;e they bind Strangers.</P>
<P>Thus much in general as to the Laws of Eng|land. The chief Particulars will come in of cour&s;e, when I come to treat of the Government.</P>
<P>The <HI>Religion</HI> of England, as it is e&s;tabli&s;h|ed by Law, is the be&s;t Reformed Religion, and the mo&s;t agreeable to the primitive Times of Chri&s;tianity. But, before I come to &s;hew the Occa&s;ion, Time, and Methods of its Re|formation, it will not be improper to give a brief hi&s;torical Account how the Chri&s;tian Faith came to be planted in this I&s;land, to &s;et forth its Progre&s;s, Decay, and Re&s;tauration; then its Corruption with Rome, and at la&s;t its Reformation.</P>
<P>That Chri&s;tianity was planted here in the Apo&s;tles Times, long before King <HI>Lucius,</HI> is plainly demon&s;trated by the <HI>Antiquity of the Briti&s;h Churches,</HI> writ &s;ome Years &s;ince by <HI>Dr. Stillingfleet,</HI> the pre&s;ent Bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter. Where he learnedly di&s;proves the Tradition concerning <HI>Jo&s;eph of Arimathea</HI> (&s;uppo&s;ed by many to have been the fir&s;t Planter of the Go|&s;pel here) as an Invention of the Monks of <HI>Gla&s;&s;enbury,</HI> to &s;erve their Intere&s;ts, by ad|vancing the Reputation of their Mona&s;tery; and makes it highly probable, that S. Paul (rather than S. Peter, as others would have it) was the fir&s;t Founder of a Church in this I&s;land. But, by rea&s;on of Per&s;ecutions, or for want of a &s;upply of Preachers, Chri&s;tianity
<PB N="62" REF="232">did not flouri&s;h here till the Reign of <HI>Lucius</HI> the Briti&s;h King, and the fir&s;t Chri&s;tian King in Europe. Of who&s;e imbracing Chri&s;tianity the learned Bi&s;hop gives this Account from the Te&s;timony of ancient Writers, that the was fir&s;t inclined thereto by the Per&s;ua&s;ion of <HI>Eluanus</HI> and <HI>Eduinus,</HI> two Briti&s;h Chri&s;tians, who were probably imploy'd to convince him. But, being workt upon on the other &s;ide by his <HI>Druids,</HI> he would not come to any Re&s;olu|tion, till he had &s;ent to Rome for his further Satisfaction, and to know how far the Briti&s;h Chri&s;tians and tho&s;e of Rome agreed. <HI>Elen|therus</HI> was then Bi&s;hop of Rome, and the twelfth from the Apo&s;tles. To whom he &s;ent the fore&s;aid <HI>Eluanus</HI> and <HI>Meduinus</HI> about the Year 180, pre&s;uming (as he might rea&s;onably then) that the Chri&s;tian Doctrine was there truly taught, at &s;o little di&s;tance from the A|po&s;tles, and in a Place whither a Re&s;ort was made from all Parts, becau&s;e of its being the Imperial City. For there was then no Ima|gination of S. Peter's having appointed the Head of the Church there, nor a long time after in the Briti&s;h Churches, as appears by the Conte&s;t of the Briti&s;h Bi&s;hops with Augu&s;tine the Monk.</P>
<P>King <HI>Lucius,</HI> being &s;atisfied upon the Return of his Emba&s;&s;adors from Rome, imbraced the Chri&s;tian Faith, and received the Bapti&s;m. So that by the piety of his Example, and the diligence of the fir&s;t Preachers, Chri&s;tianity &s;oon &s;pread over his Dominions, and &s;ometime after over all the I&s;land. And then the <HI>Britains</HI> had Bi&s;hops of their own, without any Juri|dical Dependency from the See of Rome, the Briti&s;h Church continuing a di&s;tinct and in|dependent Church from all others.</P>
<PB N="63" REF="232">
<P>But, when the Heathen <HI>Saxons</HI> came to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this Part of the I&s;land, and the Natives forced to take &s;helter among&s;t the Mountains of Wales, the Chri&s;tian Faith fled with them, and this Country was again dark|ened with Heatheni&s;m. Till about the Year 596. Au&s;tin the Monk was &s;ent by Pope Gre|gory the Great, to preach the Go&s;pel here. By who&s;e Diligence and Zeal the Work pro|&s;pered &s;o well, that all the Saxons were by degrees converted to the Chri&s;tian Faith, and Au&s;tin made the fir&s;t Arc&s;h-bi&s;hop of Canter|bury, but with a &s;ubjection to the Church of Rome. Thus, as the Errours crept on in the Roman, the Briti&s;h Church grew infected with them, and continued &s;ubject to the Power and Errours of Rome, till King Henry VIII laid the Ground for a Reformation, by his re&s;um|ing the Power of the Chri&s;tian Briti&s;h Kings his ancient Predece&s;&s;ors, and removing by virtue of it the forfeited Primacy of Rome to the See of Canterbury. But 'tis Ob&s;ervable withall, that this Ejection of the Pope's Au|thority was not done (as in other Nations) tumultuou&s;ly, and by the Power of the People, but by the Coun&s;el and Advice of godly and learned Divines a&s;&s;embled in Convocation by the King's Authority, and ratified by the Three States in Parliament.</P>
<P>Thus the ancient Dignity and Supremacy of the Kings of England being re&s;tored, and the Subjects delivered from the Spiritual Ty|ranny of the Pope of Rome, the King and Clergy took this Occa&s;ion to inquire into and reform the great Abu&s;es and Errours crept into the Church. Who&s;e Method in this Work (begun in Henry's Reign, and brought
<PB N="64" REF="233">to perfection in his next Succe&s;&s;or's Time) Dr. <HI>Heylin</HI> &s;ets forth in the&s;e Words. The Architects, &s;ays he, in this great Work, with|out re&s;pect unto the Dictates of Luther or Calvin, looking only on God's Word and the Primitive Patterns, aboli&s;hed &s;uch Things as were repugnant unto either, but &s;till retained &s;uch Ceremonies in God's publick Wor&s;hip as were agreeable to both, and had been coun|tenanced by the Practice of the Primitive Times. A Point wherein they did ob&s;erve a greater Mea&s;ure of Chri&s;tian Prudence and Moderation, than their Neighbour Churches, Which in a meer dete&s;tation of the See of Rome, allowed of nothing which had formerly been in u&s;e among&s;t them, becau&s;e defiled with Popi&s;h Errors and Abu&s;es; utterly avert|ing thereby tho&s;e of the Papal Party from joyning with them in the Work, or coming over to them when the Work was done. Whereas, had they continued an allowable Corre&s;pondency in the&s;e Extrin&s;ecals of Re|ligion with the Church of Rome, their Party in the World had been far greater, and not &s;o much &s;tomached as it is. And this Opini|on of his he backs with the Sentiment of the Marque&s;s <HI>de Rho&s;ne</HI> in this point, after Duke of <HI>Sully,</HI> and Lord High Trea&s;urer of <HI>France,</HI> one of the chief Men of the Reformed Party there. Who, being &s;ent Emba&s;&s;ador to King James from Henry IV. King of France, admired the Decency of Gods publick Service in the Church of England.</P>
<P>Three Things principally are to be con&s;ider|ed in point of Religion, viz. The Doctrine, the Manner of publick Wor&s;hip, and the Church Government.</P>
<PB N="65" REF="233">
<P>As for the Doctrine of the Church of Eng|land, 'tis the &s;ame in all Points with other Reformed Churches, as it appears by her Con|fe&s;&s;ion of Faith contained in the 39 Articles. The Manner of publick Wor&s;hip differs in nothing from them, but in the Excellency of it. So many admirable Prayers the Engli&s;h Liturgy contains, &s;utable to all Occa&s;ions, di|ge&s;ted in a plain Evangelical Style, without Rhetorical Raptures, which are fitter for a de|&s;igning Orator than an humble Addre&s;&s;er to the Mercy-Seat of God. In &s;hort, there is no|thing wanting in the Church of England, in order to Salvation. She u&s;es the Word of God, the Ten Commandments, the Faith of the Apo&s;tles, the Creeds of the Primitive Church, the Articles of the four fir&s;t General Councils, an excellent Liturgy, the Admini|&s;tration of the Sacraments, and all the Pre|cepts and Coun&s;els of the Go&s;pel. She attri|butes all Glory to God, wor&s;hips his mo&s;t holy Name, and owns all his Attributes. She a|dores the Trinity in Unity, the Unity in Tri|nity. She teaches Faith and Repentance, the Nece&s;&s;ity of good Works, the &s;trictne&s;s of a holy Life, and an humble Obedience to the Supreme Power. Charity, which is the grand Mark of the true Church, is &s;o e&s;&s;ential to this, that &s;he do's not ingro&s;s Heaven to her &s;elf, &s;o as to damn all others into Hell. For the publick Service and Wor&s;hip of God &s;he has Places, Times, Per&s;ons, and Revenues &s;et a|part for that purpo&s;e; and an uninterrupted Succe&s;&s;ion of Bi&s;hops, to ordain Prie&s;ts and Deacons, and do all other Duties iucumbent to that Dignity.</P>
<PB N="66" REF="234">
<P>Happy were it for England, if all its Sub|jects would live in the Communion of this Church, and not &s;eparate from it; which is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Thing more to be wi&s;hed, than hoped for. But &s;uch is the de&s;igning and ambitious Spirit of Popery, to weaken the Church of England (ever &s;ince the Reformation lookt upon as the chiefe&s;t Bulwark again&s;t Popery) that it has cau&s;ed all our Di&s;tractions, in order to fi&s;h the better in troubled Waters. Yet whatever have been the Effects of it hitherto, God has wonderfully defeated their De&s;igns. In&s;omuch that this Church, formerly &s;cattered and eclip|&s;ed in the Reign of Charles I, re&s;tored (but afterwards undermined) by Charles II, and lately threatned with utter Ruin by his imme|diate Succe&s;&s;or, is now, by the &s;pecial Provi|dence of God, in a Houri&s;hing Condition, un|der the happy Influence of our pre&s;ent King William, the Re&s;torer of our Laws, Religion, and Liberties.</P>
<P>As for the Spirit of Per&s;ecution which the Church of England has been charged with in relation to Di&s;&s;enters, it cannot be ju&s;tly laid to her Charge. For whatever has been done in that Ca&s;e was but according to Law, and the Penal Laws were made (as all Statute-Laws) in a regular Manner by the Votes of Parliament, the Repre&s;entatives of the People, as well Di&s;&s;enters as others. 'Tis true, the Church-Party proved the mo&s;t predominant. And yet, in point of Execution, the &s;ober part of the Church were always very tender, and none but hot Men among&s;t them ready for Execution. Influenced thereto by the Court; which, far from de&s;igning the Di&s;&s;en|ters Union with the Church, u&s;ed the Rigour of the Law, to create an implacable Hatred
<PB N="67" REF="234">betwixt the afflicting Church and the &s;uffering Body of the Di&s;&s;enters. Which had a &s;utable Effect. For the&s;e, imbittered what with Fines, what with Impri&s;onments, tho according to Law, failed not to clamour on all &s;ides again&s;t the per&s;ecuting Spirit of the Church of Eng|land, and again&s;t tho&s;e bloudy Laws, as they u&s;ed to call 'em. The Sen&s;e of their pre&s;ent &s;tate made them forget what they had done, when they u&s;urped the Regal Power; and how bu&s;y they were to impri&s;on, to bani&s;h, to &s;eque&s;ter. With Grief I rake up the&s;e old Sores, and nothing but a ju&s;t De&s;ire of right|ing both Parties could have extorted this from me.</P>
<P>But now the Di&s;&s;enters have got Liberty of Con&s;cience by a late Act of Parliament, with the ready Concurrence of the Church-Party in both Hou&s;es, I hope there's no Ground left for Animo&s;ities between the Church and Them. And, if the <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> who are the neare&s;t to the Church of England, and the greate&s;t Party among Di&s;&s;enters, now they have &s;een &s;o much of her incomparable Learning, and in|vincible Stedfa&s;tne&s;s to the Prote&s;tant Religion and Intere&s;t, would but &s;hake off their ground|le&s;s Prejudices, and prefer the happine&s;s of a Reunion before the Danger of a Schi&s;m, what a Ble&s;&s;ing it would prove to this Nation is al|mo&s;t unconceivable. 'Tis not long &s;ince the Church was their Sanctuary, when they expect|ed no Mercy from a late King, who came to the Throne, full of Re&s;entment and Indig|nation again&s;t them. Tho afterwards, to com|pa&s;s his own Ends, he tacked about, and kil|led them almo&s;t with Kindne&s;s. And why they &s;hould now &s;eparate from a Church, which was &s;o lately their Refuge, when they crowd|ed
<PB N="68" REF="235">the very Church-Men out of Church, it is pa&s;t my Under&s;tanding. For the Church of England is the &s;ame &s;till. Were they but &s;o well-minded as to make the lea&s;t &s;tep towards a Reunion, I am a&s;&s;ured the Church of Eng|land would be very forward to meet them. Rather than they &s;hould continue their Sepa|ration, and be Accountable to Gods Tribunal for it, I am more than confident &s;he would readily part with &s;uch Ceremonies as give 'em mo&s;t offence. But it is feared, they would not be &s;atisfied with tho&s;e &s;mall Conde&s;cen|&s;ions. They are for more &s;ub&s;tantial Things, which for Peace &s;ake I &s;hall forbear to name, and leave for the Reader to gue&s;s.</P>
<P>The main Points wherein they differ from the Church of England is the Church Govern|ment, and the publick Wor&s;hip. They hold, that the Church was governed in the begin|ning by Presbyters or Elders, and that it &s;hould be &s;o governed &s;till, not by Bi&s;hops; upon which account they got the Name of Presbyterians. They except both again&s;t the latitude of the Bi&s;hops Power, and the large|ne&s;s of their Revenues, as if neither of them could be u&s;ed by the Clergy with Chri&s;tian Moderation. But it is more probable, the un&s;haken fidelity of Bi&s;hops to Monarchy which many of the Di&s;&s;enters were never very fond of, &s;ticks mo&s;t in their Stomack For publick Wor&s;hip they u&s;e no Liturgy wherein they differ from the Prote&s;tan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Churches, beyond Sea. They look upon Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Forms as dead Prayers, and delight only o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Extemporal. Therefore the Lord's Prayer i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in a manner exploded by the rigid Sort o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> them.

<PB N="69" REF="235">prays before the Congregation, his Prayer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s a &s;et Form to &s;uch as pray with him. The Surplice, the Sign of the Cro&s;s, the bowing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t the Name of Je&s;us, and the kneeling at the Communion, are to them &s;o many Sins. They deal plainly with God, at lea&s;t in out|ward appearance; and are re&s;olved, as far as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ee, to &s;erve him without Ceremony. Great Prede&s;tinarians many of 'em are, and very &s;trict Ob&s;ervers of the Sabbath. In &s;hort, their ap|parent Soberne&s;s in Conver&s;ation, and Zeal in their Devotion, has &s;o increa&s;ed their Num|ber, that they are lookt upon as the chief Party among&s;t all the Di&s;&s;enters.</P>
<P>Next to whom, both in their Opinions and Number, are the <HI>Independents,</HI> or <HI>Congregationa|li&s;ts.</HI> So called, for that they will have every particular Congregation to be ruled by their own Laws, without dependence upon any other in Church-Matters.

The Holy Scripture is no Rule for 'em to go by, but In&s;piration and the Light they pretend to is all in all with them. So that any Man or Woman in their Meetings that fancies fir&s;t to be &s;eized with the Spirit, is free to &s;tand up for a Teacher to the Con|gregation, and utter what comes next. They u&s;e no Sacraments, and con&s;equently they are but half Chri&s;tians. Their Principle is for E|quality among&s;t Men, which of it &s;elf tends to Anarchy. Therefore they &s;hew re&s;pect to no Man, tho they love it well enough from Men of other Principles.

<P><HI>ENGLAND,</HI> if we except the late di|&s;tracted Times before the Re&s;tauration of Charles II, has been always governed by Sovereign Princes. Before the Romans came in, the Britains being divided into &s;everal Na|tions, each of them was governed by its own Kings and particular Princes.</P>
<P>When Britain became a Member of the Ro|man Empire, then the Britains were under the Roman Emperours.

<P>After the Romans had quitted the Stage of Britain, upon the Irruption of the Huns into Ita|ly in the Empire of Honorius, (which hap|ned in the Fifth Century) the Kingly Govern|ment returned to the Britains. Who cho&s;e for their King <HI>Con&s;tantine,</HI> Brother of Aldroinus, King of Britany in France, a Prince of the Briti&s;h Blood.

<P>This Heptarchy continued thus for &s;everal Ages &s;eparate and di&s;tinct, till the prevailing Fortune of the We&s;t-Saxons united them all into one, by the Name of <HI>England.</HI> Which hapned Anno 819, in the Reign of King <HI>Egbert,</HI> the la&s;t King of the We&s;t-Saxons, and the fir&s;t of England. Who, having vanqui&s;hed all the re&s;t of the Saxon Kings, and added mo&s;t of their E&s;tates to his own, cau&s;ed the whole uni|ted Body to be called <HI>Engel-lond,</HI> &s;ince turned into <HI>England,</HI> in a Parliament (or Council) held at Winche&s;ter, in the Year afore&s;aid. And by that Name he was then crowned in the pre&s;ence of his Nobles, and the re&s;t of his Subjects. Though the Truth is, King <HI>Alfred,</HI> a Grandchild of <HI>Egbert,</HI> was he who total|ly united the Saxon Heptarchy into one E|&s;tate.</P>
<P>Thus, from the Time of Egbert to this pre&s;ent Time, <HI>England</HI> has continued a Monarchy above 870, Year. Fir&s;t, under 15 Kings of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Bace; then under 3 <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Kings; and next to them, under Edward the Confe&s;&s;our, and <HI>Ha|rold</HI> II, two Kings of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Blood. Who were &s;ucceeded by four <HI>Norman</HI> Kings. And after Stephen the la&s;t of the Four, the <HI>Saxon</HI> Blood was again re&s;tored in the Per&s;on of King Henry II, Anno 1155, in who&s;e Blood the Crown has continued ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>Now the Engli&s;h Monarchy is none of tho&s;e De&s;potical Monarchies, where the Subjects (like Slaves) are at the Arbitrary Power and Will of their Sovereign. An unnatural &s;ort of Govern|ment, and directly contrary to the true end of Government, which is the Pre&s;ervation, Welfare, and Happine&s;s of the People. And what Happi|ne&s;s can a People propo&s;e to them&s;elves, when in&s;tead of being protected, they may be plun|dered
<PB N="76" REF="239">and murdered at the will of their Prince? Men had as good live in a &s;tate of Anarchy, as ly at &s;ome Princes Mercy, who&s;e unlimited Power &s;erves only to make them furious and outragious. And where lies the Advantage, when the King proves a cruel Tyrant, to be Robbed or Murdered by a Royal, or a common Robber?</P>
<P>The Government of England, Thanks be to God, is better Con&s;tituted. 'Tis a Monarchy, but not with that Dominion which a Ma&s;ter has over his Slave. For then the King might lawfully &s;ell all his Subjects, like &s;o many Head of Cattel, and make Mony of his whole Stock when he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>Here the Legi&s;lative Power is divided be|twixt the King and his People, but the Execu|tive Power is lodged &s;olely in the King. Here the King has his Prerogative, which is the Sup|port of the Crown; and the People their Pri|viledges, which a&s;&s;ert their Liberty. If the King &s;tretches his Prerogative &s;o far beyond its Bounds, as to overthrow the Liberty of the Subject, he unhinges the Government; and the Government being di&s;&s;olved, He and the Na|tion are to &s;eek as in the late King's Ca&s;e. If any part of the Subjects incroach upon his Preroga|tive, they undergo the la&s;h of the Law; which is no le&s;s tender of the Kings Prerogative, than of the Subjects Liberty.</P>
<P>But the Que&s;tion is, in ca&s;e of a Difference betwixt the King and his People, who is a com|petent Judge.</P>
<P>To an&s;wer this Objection, I &s;hall make u&s;e of the <HI>Inquiry into the Mea&s;ures of Submi&s;&s;ion to the Supream Authority.</HI> 'Tis to be con&s;idered, &s;ays the Learned and Judicious Author, that &s;ome Points are ju&s;tly di&s;putable and doubtful; and
<PB N="77" REF="239">others &s;o manife&s;t, that any Objections made again&s;t them are rather forced Pretences, than &s;o much as plau&s;ible Colours. If the Ca&s;e be doubtful, the Intere&s;t of the publick Peace and Order ought to carry it. But the Ca&s;e is quite different, when the Inva&s;ions that are made up|on Liberty and Property, are plain and vi&s;ible to all that con&s;ider them.</P>
<P>But, upon &s;uch an Inva&s;ion, how can the Sub|jects of England take up Arms again&s;t their King, when the Militia is by &s;everal expre&s;s Laws lodged &s;ingly in the King; and tho&s;e Laws have been put in the form of an Oath, which all that have born any Imployment either in Church or State have &s;worn? So that, though the Subjects have a Right to their Property by many po&s;itive Laws, yet they &s;eem now to have no Right or Means left to pre&s;erve it. And here &s;eems to be a Contradiction in the Engli&s;h Government; <HI>viz.</HI> a publick Liberty challenged by the Nation, and grounded upon Law, and yet a Renouncing of all Re&s;i&s;tance, when that Liberty is invaded, and that al&s;o grounded upon Law.</P>
<P>This is indeed the main Difficulty. But, in An&s;wer to it, this we mu&s;t take for a general Rule, when there &s;eems to be a Contradiction between two Articles in the Con&s;titution: That we ought to examine which of the two is the mo&s;t evident, and the mo&s;t important, and &s;o fix upon it; then we mu&s;t give &s;uch an accom|modating &s;en&s;e to that which &s;eems to contra|dict it, that &s;o we may reconcile 'em together. 'Tis plain, that our Liberty is only a Thing that we injoy at the Kings Di&s;cretion and du|ring his Plea&s;ure, if the other again&s;t all Re&s;i|&s;tance is to be under&s;tood according to the ut|mo&s;t extent of the Words. Therefore, &s;ince the chief De&s;ign of our whole Law, and of all
<PB N="78" REF="240">the &s;everal Rules of our Con&s;titution, is to &s;e|cure and maintain our Liberty, we ought to lay that down for a Conclu&s;ion, that it is both the mo&s;t plain, and the mo&s;t important of the two. And the other Article again&s;t Re&s;i&s;tance ought to be &s;o &s;oftened, as that it do not de&s;troy us.</P>
<P>If the Law never de&s;igned to lodge the Le|gi&s;lative Power in the King, as it is &s;elf-evident, 'tis plain it did not intend to &s;ecure him in it, in ca&s;e he &s;hould go about to a&s;&s;ume it. Therefore the not re&s;i&s;ting the King can only be applied to the Executive Power, that &s;o, up|on no pretence of ill Admini&s;trations in the Execution of the Law, it &s;hould be lawful to re&s;i&s;t him. Another Proof that the Law only de&s;igned to &s;ecure the King in the Executive Power, is the Words of the Oath, which makes it unlawful to bear Arms again&s;t the King, or any Commi&s;&s;ionated by him. For, if the Com|mi&s;&s;ion be not according to Law, 'tis no Com|mi&s;&s;ion; and con&s;equently tho&s;e who act by virtue of it, are not Commi&s;&s;ionated by the King in the &s;en&s;e of the Law.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, all general Words, how compre|hen&s;ive &s;oever, are &s;till &s;uppo&s;ed to have a tacit Exception and Re&s;erve in them, if the matter &s;eem to require it. Thus Children are commanded to obey their Parents in <HI>all Things;</HI> and Wives are declared by the Scripture to be &s;ubject to their Husbands in <HI>all Things, as the Church is unto Chri&s;t.</HI> For odious Things ought not to be &s;u&s;pected, and therefore not named upon &s;uch Occa&s;ions; but when they fall out, they carry &s;till their own force with them. So by our Form of Marriage, the Parties &s;wear to one another, <HI>till Death them do part;</HI> and yet few doubt but that this Bond is di&s;&s;olved by Adultery, though it is not named.</P>
<PB N="79" REF="240">
<P>In &s;hort, when a King of England &s;trikes at the very Foundations of the Government, as the late King did, and that his Malever&s;ations are not only the effect of Humane Frailty, of Ignorance, Inadvertencies, or Pa&s;&s;ions, to which all Princes may be &s;ubject, as well as other Men, in &s;uch Ca&s;es that King may fall from his Pow|er, or at lea&s;t from the Exerci&s;e of it, and &s;uch his Attempts (in the very Judgement of the greate&s;t A&s;&s;ertors of Monarchy,) naturally di|ve&s;t him of his whole Authority. To this purpo&s;e we have &s;till fre&s;h before us the Example of the late King of Portugal, who for a few Acts of Rage fatal to very few Per&s;ons, was put under a Guardian&s;hip, and kept a Pri&s;oner till he died, and his Brother the pre&s;ent King made Regent in his place. Which it &s;eems was (at lea&s;t &s;ecretly) approved by mo&s;t of the Crowned Heads of Europe, and even our Court gave the fir&s;t Countenance to it. Though of all others, King Charles II. had the lea&s;t Rea&s;on to do it, &s;ince it ju&s;tified a Younger Brother's &s;upplanting the Elder. But the Evidence of the Thing carried it even a|gain&s;t Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The&s;e are my Authors Arguments, which I thought fit to in&s;i&s;t upon, to ju&s;tify the Na|tions taking up Arms for the Defence of their Laws, Religion, and Property, again&s;t the late King's actual and bare-faced Subverting the whole Frame of this mo&s;t happy and ble&s;&s;ed Government.</P>
<P>A Government which has made many Kings glorious beyond the Great Nimrod of France, and their People happy beyond all other Na|tions. A Government which allows enough to a King that cares not to be a Tyrant, and e|nough to the People to keep them from Sla|very.
<PB N="80" REF="241">When the King's Prerogative do's not interfere with the Liberty of the People, or the Peoples Liberty with the Kings Preroga|tive, that is, when both King and People keep within their own Sphere, there is no better framed Government under the Sun. Here is Monarchy without Slavery; a great King, and yet a free People. And, the Legi&s;lative-Power being lodged in the King, Lords, and Com|mons joyntly, 'tis &s;uch a Monarchy as has the main Advantages of an Ari&s;tocracy in the Lords, and of a Democracy in the Commons, without the Di&s;advantages or Evils of either.</P>
<P>The Government of England being thus con|&s;titued, I &s;ee no Ground there is for pa&s;|&s;ive Obedience, where the Kings Commands are vi&s;ibly contrary to Law, and de&s;tructive of the Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>The Mea&s;ures of Power, and con&s;equently of Obedience, mu&s;t be taken from the expre&s;s Laws of the State, or from Immemorial Cu|&s;toms, or from particular Oaths which the Sub|jects &s;wear to their Princes. And, in all Di|&s;putes between Power and Liberty, Power mu&s;t always be proved, for Liberty proves it &s;elf; that being founded only upon a Po&s;itive Law, this upon the Law of Nature.</P>
<P>Now 'tis plain, the Law of Nature has put no Difference (or Subordination) among&s;t Men, except it be that of Children to their Parents, or of Wives to their Husbands. So that, with relation to the Law of Nature, all Men are born Free; and this Liberty mu&s;t be &s;till &s;uppo&s;ed intire, unle&s;s &s;o far as it is limit|ed by Contracts, Provi&s;ions, and Laws.</P>
<P>And, as a private Per&s;on can bind him&s;elf to another Man by different Degrees, either as a common Servant for Wages, or as an Ap|prentice
<PB N="81" REF="241">appropriate for a longer Time, or as a Slave by a total giving him&s;elf up to an|other; &s;o may &s;everal Bodies of Men give them&s;elves upon different Terms and Degrees to the Conduct of others. And, as in tho&s;e Ca&s;es the general Name of <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> may be equally u&s;ed, tho the degrees of his Power are to be judged by the nature of the Contract; &s;o in the&s;e all may carry the &s;ame Name of <HI>King,</HI> and yet every ones Power is to be taken from the Mea&s;ures of that Authority which is lodged in him, and not from any general Spe|culations founded on &s;ome equivocal Terms, &s;uch as King, Sovereign, or Supream.</P>
<P>But this has been of late &s;o learnedly argued, that I &s;hall wave any further Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this Matter. This only I &s;hall add, that the King of England is, by the moderate A&s;&s;ertors of this Monarchy, called <HI>Pater Patriae,</HI> and <HI>Spon&s;us Regni.</HI> By which Metaphorical Characters the King and his Subjects come within the Relation of a Father and Children, or within that of a Husband and Wife; which is proper enough to repre&s;ent the Nature and Mildne&s;s of the Engli&s;h Government. Others make King and Subject to be no other Relation than that of <HI>Gardian</HI> and <HI>Ward. Ad tutelam namque</HI> (&s;ays Forte&s;cue) <HI>Legis Subditorum, ac eorum Corporum &amp; Bonorum, Rex huju&s;modi erectus e&s;t;</HI> the King being ordained for the Defence or Gardian&s;hip of the Laws of his Subjects, and of their Bodies and Goods.</P>
<P>I have done, and now I proceed to a fur|ther De&s;cription of this Monarchy. 'Tis Free and Independent, that is, not holden of any Earthly Potentate, or any ways obliged to do Homage for the &s;ame; as the Kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> holden of the Pope by the King of
<PB N="82" REF="242">Spain, and that of <HI>Scotlund</HI> which held <HI>in Ca|pite</HI> of the Crown of England. Whereas the Kingdom of <HI>England</HI> owns no Superiour upon Earth.</P>
<P>A Monarchy that ju&s;tly challenges a Free|dom from all Subjection to the Emperour, or Laws of the Empire. For, tho the Ro|man Emperors were anciently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this Country, and got by force of Arms the Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of it; yet, upon their quitting the &s;ame, the Right (by the Law of Nations) returned to the former Owners <HI>pro Derelicto,</HI> as the Ci|vilians &s;peak.</P>
<P>The &s;ame is al&s;o free from all manner of Subjection to the Pope of Rome, and con&s;e|quently from tho&s;e &s;everal Inconveniencies and Burdens which ly upon Popi&s;h Kingdoms. As Taxes paid to that Bi&s;hop, Provi&s;ions and Di&s;pen&s;ations in &s;everal Ca&s;es to be procured from the Court of Rome, and Appeals thither in Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Suits.</P>
<P>'Tis an Hereditary Monarchy, and &s;uch as allow's of no <HI>Interregnum;</HI> free therefore from tho&s;e Mi&s;chiefs and Inconveniencies which fre|quently attend &s;uch Kingdoms as are Elective. Though it is granted, at lea&s;t it &s;eems appa|rent by Hi&s;tory, that England has been an E|lective Kingdom, e&s;pecially in the Time of the Saxons; When, upon the King's Death, tho&s;e Per&s;ons of the Realm that compo&s;ed the then Parliament a&s;&s;embled, in order to the chu&s;ing of another. And, tho one or other of the Royal Bloud was always cho&s;en, yet the next in lineal Succe&s;&s;ion was often &s;et a&s;ide, as is evident from the Genealogies of the Sax|on Kings. But, however it was in tho&s;e and after Times, certain it is that ever &s;ince King Henry VII. the Crown has run in a cour&s;e
<PB N="83" REF="242">of lineal Succe&s;&s;ion by Right of Inheritance. Till the late King, having for&s;aken the Go|vernment and abdicated the Kingdom, the Crown (with the general Con&s;ent of the Na|tion) was &s;et upon the Head of the Prince of Orange (our pre&s;ent King) joyntly with the Prince&s;s the next Heir to King James, and the Succe&s;&s;ion &s;ettled as will appear afterwards. And upon William and Mary, our Gracious King and Queen, may the Crown long flouri&s;h.</P>
<P>To conclude, whatever be the Bent and In|clination of &s;ome Men among&s;t us for a Com|monwealth, the Generality of the Nation is &s;o much for Monarchy, that it is like &s;o to continue as long as the World indures. In that Eclip&s;e of Monarchy which hapned before the Re&s;tauration of King Charles II, how bu&s;y then the Commonwealth Party was to provide again&s;t its Return, and to &s;ettle here Democra|cy for ever, all the World know's. No Stone was left unturned, and what came of it? As &s;oon as ever Opportunity &s;erved, the very Presbyterians them&s;elves joyned with the Royali&s;ts to bring in the exiled King, and re|e&s;tabli&s;h the ancient Government. So &s;oon the Nation grew &s;ick of the Commonwealth, and &s;o &s;trong was then the Current for Monar|chy, that, without the &s;hedding of a drop of Bloud, the fir&s;t was in a manner hi&s;&s;ed out of the Nation, and Monarchy re&s;tored with the greate&s;t Pomp and Joy imaginable.</P>
<P>I &s;et a&s;ide the Zeal of our Engli&s;h Clergy for Monarchy, and their Influence upon the Laity. The great Number alone of our Nobi|lity and Gentry, with their proportionable A&s;|cendent upon the People, makes me look upon it as a moral Impo&s;&s;ibility for Commonwealth-Government ever to prevail here. 'Tis well
<PB N="84" REF="243">known, the Genius of Commonwealths is for keeping down the Nobility, and extingui&s;hing all tho&s;e Beams of Royalty. Therefore as 'tis their Intere&s;t, &s;o I &s;uppo&s;e it will be their Care, to &s;tick to Monarchy.</P>

In
<PB N="85" REF="243">who&s;e Succe&s;&s;or's Reign, Henry VIII, they were made by Act of Parliament one Nation with the Engli&s;h, &s;ubject to the &s;ame Laws, capable of the &s;ame Preferments, priviledged with the &s;ame Immunities, and inabled to &s;end Knights and Burge&s;&s;es to the Engli&s;h Parlia|ment. So that the Name and Language only excepted, there is now no Difference be|tween the Engli&s;h and Wel&s;h. A very happy Union.</P>
<P><HI>Scotland</HI> was al&s;o brought into Subjection by the &s;ame King Edward; &s;o that he received Homage of its King and Nobility, and had there his Chancery and other Courts under a Vice|roy.

In&s;omuch that he ex|cluded David, the Son of <HI>Robert Bruce</HI> from the Crown, then forced to fly into France, and re&s;tored the Hou&s;e of <HI>Baliol</HI> to the King|dom, in the per&s;on of <HI>Edward</HI> Son of King <HI>John Baliol.</HI> Who, upon his coming to the Crown, did Homage to this King Edward, as his Father had done to King Edward I. But 'twas not long before the Scots quitted again their Subjection and Va&s;&s;alage to the Crown of England, the Roll of <HI>Ragman</HI> being trea|cherou&s;ly delivered into their hands by Roger Mortimer Earl of March. Which Roll con|tained a Confe&s;&s;ion and Acknowledgement of the E&s;tates of Scotland, &s;ub&s;cribed by all their Hands and Seals; whereby they owned the
<PB N="86" REF="244">Superiority of the Kings of England, not only in regard of &s;uch Advantages as the Sword had given them, but as of their original and un|doubted Right.</P>
<P>But, &s;etting a&s;ide this point of Va&s;&s;alage, the Kings of England are Kings of Scotland by a better Title. For King James VI of Scot|land, and the fir&s;t of England, &s;ucceeded Q. Elizabeth in the Realm of England, as the next Heir to the Crown, Anno 1602; being de&s;cended, by Mary Queen of the Scots his Mother, from Margaret, the elde&s;t Daughter of Henry the VII. King of England, and Wife to James IV, of Scotland. And here the Wi&s;|dom and prudent Fore&s;ight of Henry is very remarkable. Who, having two Daughters, be|&s;towed the Elde&s;t (contrary to the Mind of his Council) on the King of Scots, and the younger on the French King; that, if his own I&s;&s;ue Male &s;hould fail, as it did by the Death of his Grand&s;on King Edward VI, and that a Prince of another Nation mu&s;t inherit England, then Scotland as the le&s;&s;er Kingdom, &s;hould depend upon England, and not England wait on France, as upon the greater. In which Succe&s;&s;ion of the Scots to the Crown of England, the Prophecy of the fatal Stone received ac|compli&s;hment. I mean the Stone which the Scots lookt upon as their <HI>Palladium,</HI> kept at <HI>Scone</HI> in Scotland, the u&s;ual Place for the Coronation of the Scoti&s;h Kings; upon which they received their Crown, till the Removal of it unto We&s;t|min&s;ter by King Edward I. The Ver&s;es of old ingraven upon this Stone run thus,
<Q><L>Non fallat Fatum, Scoti quocunque locatum,</L>
<L>Invenient Lapidem, regnare tenentur ibidem.</L></Q></P>
<PB N="87" REF="244">
<P>Tran&s;lated in old Meeter thus.
<Q><L>The Scots &s;hall brook that Realm as natif Ground,</L>
<L>If <HI>Weirds</HI> fail not, where ere this Stone is found.</L></Q></P>
<P>Thus the Scots, &s;o often quelled and curbed by the Engli&s;h, never &s;ubdued England but by this ble&s;&s;ed Victory.</P>
<P>Ever &s;ince this happy Union, Scotland has been deprived of its Kings Re&s;idence there, who changed the wor&s;e Seat for the better. But under the King there is a chief Gover|nour appointed by his Maje&s;ty, the <HI>Lord High Commi&s;&s;ioner</HI> of <HI>Scotland;</HI> who, by that Title, injoys the ordinary Power and Authority of a Viceroy. In this manner <HI>Scotland</HI> has con|tinued to this day a &s;eparate Kingdom, governed by its own Laws. 'Tis true there have been &s;everal Attempts made to unite it into one Kingdom with England, as <HI>Wales</HI> was by Henry VIII. But hitherto they proved un|&s;uccesfull.</P>
<P>So far we have cleared in few Words by Hi|&s;tory the whole I&s;le of <HI>Great Britain</HI> to the King of England; with the numerous I&s;lands about it, the principal of which are the I&s;les of <HI>Shepey, Thanet, Wight, Angle&s;ey,</HI> and <HI>Man.</HI></P>
<P>The next that offers it &s;elf is the Kingdom of <HI>Ireland,</HI> a great Part whereof was Con|quered by the Engli&s;h about the Year 1172. in the Reign of Henry II, and the Occa&s;ion thus. Ireland being then divided among&s;t &s;e|veral <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">petty Kings, the King of Lein&s;ter was by the King of Meath driven out of his Kindom.
<PB N="88" REF="245">He fled to England for Refuge; where, applying him&s;elf to King Henry, Henry re&s;olved to at|tempt his Re&s;tauration; which he did effectu|ally, and in the doing of it, brought the be&s;t part of the I&s;land under the Engli&s;h Subjection. King John, the Younger Son of Henry, was the fir&s;t who was Intituled Lord of Ireland. Which Stile was granted him by Pope Urban III, and continued to his Succe&s;&s;ors (though in effect Kings thereof) till the Year 1542; when Henry VIII, was declared in an Iri&s;h Parliament King of Ireland, as a Name more &s;acred and re|plete with Maje&s;ty. But the Engli&s;h never made a full and entire Conque&s;t of that King|dom till the latter end of Queen Elizabeths Reign, upon the great Defection of the Iri&s;h. Which ended in a total Overthrow of the Re|bels, then under the Conduct of <HI>Hugh O Neal,</HI> Earl of <HI>Tiroen;</HI> and the con&s;equence of it, ac|cording to the Rule, That every Rebellion, when 'tis &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, does make the Prince &s;tronger, and the Subjects weaker: Which I hope will be the effect of the pre&s;ent Rebellion in that Kingdom.</P>
<P>But, be&s;ides Great Britain and Ireland, the King of England is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of <HI>Jer&s;ey, Garn|&s;ey, Alderney,</HI> and <HI>Sark,</HI> four I&s;lands of good note (e&s;pecially the two fir&s;t) on the Coa&s;t of Nor|mandy in France. The &s;ame are holden in right of that Dukedom, which was Conquered by Henry I, of England, and continued Engli&s;h till the Days of King John; when Philip II, of France, &s;urnamed Augu&s;tus, &s;eized on all the E&s;tates the Engli&s;h had in France, as Forfei|tures, Anno 1202. And, &s;ince the French &s;ei|zed upon Normandy, they have often attemp|ted <HI>Jer&s;ey,</HI> and <HI>Garn&s;ey,</HI> but always with repul&s;e and lo&s;s. So affectionate are the People to the
<PB N="89" REF="245">Engli&s;h Government, and jealous of the Privi|ledges they injoy under it, which they could not hope for from the French.</P>
<P>In America the King of England is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of <HI>New-England, Virginia, Mary-Land, New York, Pen&s;ylvania, Carolina,</HI> and <HI>Hud&s;ons-Bay.</HI> Be&s;ides many noted I&s;lands, as <HI>New-found Land, Jamaica, Bermudos, Barbados;</HI> and, among&s;t the Lee|ward I&s;lands, <HI>Nevis, Antego, Mont&s;erat, Anguil|la,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>In A&s;ia he has the I&s;le of <HI>Bombay</HI> near Goa, which was Part of the pre&s;ent Queen Dowagers Portion; be&s;ides Conveniencies for Traffick in India, China, and the Levant. The &s;ame he has upon the Coa&s;t of Africk.</P>
<P>The King of England has a Claim be&s;ides to the <HI>Sovereignty of all the Seas</HI> round about Great Britain and Ireland, and all the I&s;les adjacent, even to the Shores of all the Neighbouring Na|tions. Therefore all Foreiners Ships have an|ciently demanded Leave to Fi&s;h, and to pa&s;s in the&s;e Seas; and to this day lower their Top-Sails to all the Kings Ships of War. Our Law faith, the Sea is of the Liegeance of the King, as well as the Land. And accordingly Children born upon our four Seas (as &s;ometimes it does happen) are accounted natural born Subjects of the King of England, without being naturali|zed.</P>
<P>The King of England has moreover a Title to the Kingdom of France. Fir&s;t Challenged by King Edward III, as Son and Heir of I&s;abel, the Daughter of King Philip the Fair, and Si&s;ter of Lewis IX, Philip V, and Charles the Fair, who reigned &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, and died without I&s;&s;ue Male. To pro&s;ecute which Title, he entred in|to France with an Army, took upon him the Title of King of France, and cau&s;ed the Flower
<PB N="90" REF="246">de luces to be quartered with the Lions of England; which has been continued ever &s;ince among&s;t all his Succe&s;&s;ors. The French (oppo&s;ing his Title by virtue of a pretended Salique Law, di&s;abling Women from the Succe&s;&s;ion to the Crown) he overthrew in two great Battels, with a &s;mall Force under the Conduct of the in|comparable Edward the Black Prince his Son, Duke of Aquitain. Tho&s;e were the <HI>Battels</HI> of <HI>Cre&s;&s;y</HI> and <HI>Poitiers,</HI> the fir&s;t being fought Anno 1343, in the Reign of <HI>Philip</HI> VI, &s;urnamed <HI>de Valois,</HI> and that of Poitiers in the Reign of his Son King <HI>John,</HI> who was taken Pri&s;oner with Philip his Son, and brought over into England. But &s;uch is the Vici&s;&s;itude of Humane Affairs, that the Engli&s;h &s;oon after lo&s;t all they had got in the&s;e Wars, <HI>Calais</HI> excepted. For Charles V, of France, the Son of John, proved too hard for Richard II, of England, one of our unfortu|nate Kings, the next Succe&s;&s;or of King Edward III, and his Grand&s;on by Edward the Black Prince.</P>
<P>But Henry V, his next Succe&s;&s;or but one, did &s;o far pur&s;ue the Title of France, that he won it, after he had won the great Battle of <HI>Agin|court,</HI> which happened Anno 1415. The Op|portunity was great, whether we con&s;ider the Weakne&s;s and di&s;tracted Condition of Charles VI, then King of France, or the very Di&s;traction of the Kingdom at that time occa&s;ioned by the Faction of Burgundy again&s;t that of Orleans. So that, being &s;ought to for Peace, he granted it with the&s;e Conditions, that upon his Mar|riage with the Lady Catharine, Daughter to King Charles, he &s;hould be made Regent of France, during Charles his Life, and after the Death of Charles, the Crown of France and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> its Rights &s;hould remain to King Henry and
<PB N="91" REF="246">his Heirs for ever; which was agreed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oth &s;ides. And, though Henry did not live <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o po&s;&s;e&s;s the Kingdom, yet his Son Henry VI, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ad the fortune to be Crowned King of France in Paris; which he held during the life of his Uncle John of Bedford, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Humfrey of Glo|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;ter. After who&s;e Deaths he not only lo&s;t France to the French, but England and his Life to the Yorki&s;h Faction.</P>
<P>Thus Charles VII, Son of Charles VI, after <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> long and bloody War, recovered from the Engli&s;h, then divided at Home, all their Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions in France, except <HI>Calais.</HI> Which la&s;t remained under the Engli&s;h till Queen Maries Reign, and was taken from her by Henry II, of France. And ever &s;ince Things have remained much in the &s;ame Po&s;ture, the Kings of Eng|land with the Title to France, and the French Kings with the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Nay we have had two Kings of late &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately inamoured with the pre&s;ent French King, that far from attempting to take the lea&s;t Flower of his Crown from him, have promoted his Greatne&s;s, and encou|raged his Rapines and unju&s;t U&s;urpations. The Scope whereof at la&s;t appeared to be no le&s;s than the In&s;laving this Nation, with the A&s;|&s;i&s;tance of France; and, far from rai&s;ing the Glory of the Engli&s;h, to make them an Object of Scorn and Contempt to the World.</P>
<P>But now we are ble&s;t with a wi&s;e, ju&s;t, and magnanimous King, three Vertues that have been long ab&s;ent from the Throne of England, we may hope &s;hortly to &s;ee France, if not Con|quered again, at lea&s;t &s;o humbled and weaken|ed, that it &s;hall not be in her power to in&s;ult and incroach upon her Neighbours as &s;he has in our Time, to the Ruin and De&s;olation of the be&s;t Part of Europe. 'Twas a notable (if
<PB N="92" REF="247">not Prophetick) An&s;wer which an Engli&s;hman made to a French Officer; who, after the Eng|li&s;h had lo&s;t France, asked him in a &s;coffing manner, <HI>When they would return thither? Whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> your Sins,</HI> &s;ays he <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">re greater than ours.</HI> As ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> as this Nation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> been, 'tis apparent the French have far outdone us in their Pride and Lewdne&s;s, Cruelties and U&s;urpations. So that I hope, from the Di&s;po&s;ition of the pre|&s;ent Affairs of Europe, the Time is come for France to give an Account thereof to God and Man.</P>
<P>I come now to the King of England's <HI>Titles,</HI> which run thus at pre&s;ent, joyntly with Queen Mary; <HI>William and Mary, by the Grace of God, King and Queen of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, Defenders of the Faith.</HI> Which la&s;t Title was given by Pope Leo X, to King Hen|ry VIII, for a Book written by him again&s;t Luther, in Defence of &s;ome Points of the Ro|mi&s;h Religion; and afterwards confirmed by Act of Parliament, for Defence of the ancient Catholick and Apo&s;tolick Faith, as it is now profe&s;&s;ed by the Church of England. Where|as the King of France is called <HI>Mo&s;t Chri|&s;tian,</HI> and the King of Spain <HI>Mo&s;t Catho|lick.</HI></P>
<P>The Title of <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> came not into u&s;e in England till the Reign of Henry VIII. In&s;tead whereof the Title of <HI>Grace,</HI> now appropriated to the Dukes and the two Archbi&s;hops, was gi|ven to former Kings; and that of Highne&s;s to the fore&s;aid King <HI>Henry,</HI> till the Word <HI>Ma|je&s;ty</HI> prevailed.</P>

<P>He has the Choice and Nomination of all Coun&s;ellours and Officers of State, of all the Judges, Bi&s;hops, and other high Dignities in the Church.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the King is the Fountain of Ho|nour, Ju&s;tice, and Mercy.

<P>In point of Phy&s;ick, by an ancient Record, it is declared, That no Phy&s;ick ought to be ad|mini&s;tred to the King, without a Warrant &s;igned by the Privy Council, by no other Phy&s;ician but what is mentioned in the Warrant, and the Phy&s;icians to prepare it them&s;elves with their own hands. If there be occa&s;ion for a

<P>'Tis true, the King of England is not free to act contrary to, or to di&s;pen&s;e with the known e&s;ta|bli&s;hed Laws. Neither can he of him&s;elf re|peal a Law, or make any new Law, without the Concurrence of both Hou&s;es of Parliament. A happy Impotency, both to King and People. For, whil&s;t the King keeps within the Bounds of the Law, he can do no Wrong, and the People can receive no Harm.</P>
<P>Had the late King but acted accordingly, he might have been a mo&s;t glorious Monarch, in|&s;tead of being now a general Object of Pity. Far from being nece&s;&s;itated to creep under the &s;helter of a Proud Monarch, he might have been a Curb to his Pride, and the Refuge of many Nations that &s;uffered Fire and Sword, to advance what he called his Glory. Three Crowns at once are too great a Sacri|fice, not to God, but to a Mercenary Crew of Prie&s;ts and Je&s;uits. <HI>Tantum Religio potuit &s;uadere Malorum.</HI></P>
<P>As to the <HI>Rank</HI> and <HI>Reputation</HI> of the Kings of England, when all Chri&s;tendom in the Coun|cil of <HI>Con&s;tance</HI> was divided into Nations, the Engli&s;h was one of the Principal, and not Sub|altern, having its Voice of equal ballance with the Nations of France or Italy.

<P>However the King of England acknowledges no Precedence to any Monarch, but only to the Emperour, and that upon the Score of An|tiquity. For the Crown of England is free and independent, and therefore has been declared in Parliaments long &s;ince to be an Imperial Crown.</P>

<P>After that, the Litany was &s;ung by two Bi|&s;hops. And after the Epi&s;tle, Go&s;pel, and Nicene Creed, the Bi&s;hop of Salisbury began the Sermon, his Text being taken out of 2 Sam. 23. V. 3 &amp; 4.</P>

<P>And, as to that divine Prerogative which the Kings of England claimed as a Thing <HI>de Jure divino,</HI> I mean the Curing of the <HI>King's Evil,</HI> only by the King's laying his hands on the Sick, a&s;&s;i&s;ted with a &s;hort Form of Divine Service, it is now laid a&s;ide, as a Traditional Errour, at lea&s;t a Doctrine not fit to be tru&s;ted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o. So that the French King is at this time the only Monarch that pretends to this Mira|culous Priviledge. Our Hi&s;torians derived it here from King Edward the Confe&s;&s;our, who lived &s;o holy a Life, that (as they &s;ay) he re|ceived Power from above, Intailed to his Royal Succe&s;&s;ors for ever, to cure this &s;tubborn Di&s;|ea&s;e.

<P>In the fir&s;t Sen&s;e, <HI>England,</HI> if well united, is of all the States in Europe the lea&s;t &s;ubject to an Inva&s;ion, e&s;pecially &s;ince the Conjunction of Scotland. The whole I&s;land is naturally &s;o well &s;enced with the Ocean, and (when Occa&s;ion requires) &s;o well garded by tho&s;e moving Ca&s;tles, the King's Ships of War, the &s;tronge&s;t and be&s;t built in the whole World. The Kingdom be|&s;ides is &s;o abundantly furni&s;hed with Men and Hor&s;es, with Provi&s;ions and Ammunition, and Mony the Sinews of War, that nothing but our inte&s;tine Divi&s;ions can make us a Prey to the greate&s;t Potentates of Europe, tho uni|ted together.</P>
<PB N="114" REF="258">
<P>As for the King's Power abroad, not only our Neighbours, but the mo&s;t remote Places, have &s;ufficiently felt it, and this at a time when Scotland and Ireland were u&s;ually at enmity with Him. 'Tis true, &s;ince the Reign of Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Elizabeth, what with our Di&s;tractions at home, and the Weakne&s;s or Effeminacy of &s;ome of one Kings, <HI>England</HI> has either been Idle, or taken up with Inte&s;tine Broils. Only, in Cromwel's Time, we humbled the Hollanders, &s;cowred the Al|gerines, kept the French and the Pope in aw, and took Jamaica from Spain. Our greate&s;t Exploits were upon our own &s;elves, when, be|ing unhappily involved in Civil Wars for &s;e|veral Years together, we de&s;troy'd one an|other with a fatal Courage. Then were com|puted about two hundred thou&s;and Foot, and fifty thou&s;and Hor&s;e, to be in Arms on both, &s;ides; which, had they been imploy'd abroad, might have &s;haken the greate&s;t part of Europe.

<P>The next Thing that offers it &s;elf to our Con|&s;ideration, is the King of England's <HI>Court,</HI> which for State, Greatne&s;s, and good Order, be&s;ides the con&s;tant Concour&s;e of Nobility and Gentry re&s;orting thither, when there is no Jealou&s;y be|tween the King and his People, is one of the chief Courts of Europe. It is, as an Author &s;ays, a Monarchy within a Monarchy, con&s;i&s;t|ing of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical, Civil, and Military Per|&s;ons, the two la&s;t under their proper Govern|ment.</P>
<P>To &s;upport the Grandure of this Court, and the other Charges of the Crown in time of Peace, the Kings of England have always had competent <HI>Revenues.</HI> Which never were rai&s;ed by any of tho&s;e &s;ordid Ways u&s;ed in other Countries; but con&s;i&s;t chiefly in Domains or Lands belonging to the Crown, in Cu&s;toms, and Exci&s;e.</P>
<P>Anciently the very Domains of the Crown, and Fee-Farm Rents, were &s;o con&s;iderable, that they were almo&s;t &s;ufficient to di&s;charge all the ordinary Expences of the Crown, without any Tax or Impo&s;t upon the Subject. Then there was &s;carce a County in England but the King
<PB N="116" REF="259">had in it a Royal Ca&s;tle, a Fore&s;t, and a Park, to Receive and Divert Him in his Royal Pro|gre&s;&s;es. A piece of Grandure, which no King el&s;e could boa&s;t of. But, upon the Re&s;taura|tion of King Charles, the Crown Revenues be|ing found much Impaired, and the Crown Char|ges increa&s;ing upon the growing Greatne&s;s of our Neighbours the French and Dutch, the Parliament &s;ettled upon the King a Yearly Re|venue of Twelve Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds, by &s;everal Impo&s;ts; be&s;ides the Domains and other Profits ari&s;ing to the Crown in Tenths and Fir&s;t-Fruits, in Reliefs, Fines, Amercia|ments, and Confi&s;cations. And the whole Re|venue improved to that degree, that in the late Reign it was judged to amount to near two Millions. Which is a Fair Revenue in Time of Peace.</P>
<P>In Time of War, the Parliament &s;upplies the King, according to his Occa&s;ions, by &s;uch Taxes to be rai&s;ed upon the Nation as they think mo&s;t convenient.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the Government of</HI> England <HI>by Regency; Al&s;o, of the Succe&s;&s;ion to the Crown.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THere are three Ca&s;es, wherein the King|dom of England is not immediately governed by the King, but by a Sub|&s;titute Regent. And tho&s;e are the Kings Minori|ty, Ab&s;ence, or Incapacity.</P>
<P>The King is by Law under Age, when he is under twelve Years old. And, till he has at|tained to that Age, the Kingdom is governed by a <HI>Regent, Protector,</HI> or <HI>Gardian,</HI> appointed ei|ther by the King his Predece&s;&s;or, or (for want of &s;uch Appointment,) by the Three States a&s;|&s;embled in the Name of the Infant King. Who, in &s;uch Ca&s;e, u&s;ually make choice of &s;uch a Per&s;on among the Nobility, as is fit for that Station, who&s;e private Intere&s;t is to pre&s;erve the Kings Life and Authority, and to whom lea&s;t benefit can accrue by his Death or Dimi|nution.</P>
<P>Thus, in the Ca&s;e of Edward VI, the Duke of Somer&s;et, his Uncle by the Mothers &s;ide, was made Lord Protector during the Kings Mi|nority. And, when this Rule has not been ob|&s;erved, as in the Minority of Edward V, it has proved of very ill con&s;equence.</P>
<PB N="118" REF="260">
<P>But this is ob&s;ervable withall, that when th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> King comes to be 24 Years of Age, he may b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his Letters Patents under the Great Seal (a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|cording to a Statute made in the Reign of <HI>He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ry</HI> VIII,) revoke and utterly null what&s;oeve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> has been Enacted in Parliament during his M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|nority.</P>
<P>When the King was Ab&s;ent upon any &s;o reign Expedition (as &s;everal of our Kings have been with good &s;ucce&s;s,) the Cu&s;tom was for merly to con&s;titute a Vicegerent, by Com+mi&s;&s;ion under the Great Seal, with the Tit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of <HI>Lord Warden</HI> (or <HI>Lord Keeper</HI>) of the King+dom, and &s;ometimes that of <HI>Protector.</HI> And &s;uch was the Latitude of his Power, that, ex|cept wearing of the Crown, he was as great a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the King. But &s;ometimes the Kingdom, durin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the King's Ab&s;ence, has been committed to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Care of &s;everal Noblemen.</P>
<P>During the Ab&s;ence of Henry VIII, in France which hapned two &s;everal times, the Quee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was made <HI>Regent.</HI> And &s;o is at this time o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Gracious Queen Mary, during his Maje&s;ties &s;o reign Expedition.</P>
<P>So, in ca&s;e of the Kings Incapacity to go|vern, either through Age, or Weakne&s;s, or by rea&s;on of &s;ome Incurable Di&s;ea&s;e, a <HI>Gardian <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Regent</HI> is con&s;tituted to govern the Kingdom for Him.

<P>I come now to the <HI>Succe&s;&s;ion to the Cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> Which is not in England as in France, Tur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">

<P>In &s;hort, upon the Death of the King or Queen upon the Throne, the next of Kindred (though born out of the Dominions of Eng|land, or of Parents not Subjects of England) is immediately King or Queen, before any Pro|clamation, or Coronation.

<P>But the Government being lately Di&s;&s;olved by King James his Mi&s;government as well as Abdication, the Crown was &s;ettled in this man|ner by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons a&s;&s;embled at We&s;tmin&s;ter in the Month of December, Anno 1689.

<P>When King Edward I, had compleated the Conque&s;t of <HI>Wales,</HI> He divided it into Seven Shires, to which Henry VIII, added five more out of the March Lands. Over each of the Se|ven Shires King Edward placed a particular Engli&s;h Lieutenant, and over the whole he de|&s;igned a Vicegerent. The <HI>Welch</HI> being di&s;gu&s;ted at this, He &s;ent for his Queen, then great with Child, to <HI>Caernarvan,</HI> where &s;he was delivered of a Son. Upon the News whereof, the King a&s;&s;embled the Chief Men of that Nation, and offered to name them a Governour born in <HI>Wales,</HI> who could not &s;peak one word of En|gli&s;h, and again&s;t who&s;e Life they could take no ju&s;t exception. Such a one when they had all &s;worn to obey, he named his young Son Edward. Whereupon He created him Prince of <HI>Wales;</HI> and &s;ince that time, the Kings of England el|de&s;t Sons have been called Princes of <HI>Wales.</HI> Whereas, while Normandy was in the Power of the Engli&s;h, which la&s;ted till the Reign of King John, they were &s;tiled Dukes of Nor|mandy.</P>
<P>The Inve&s;titure is performed by the Impo&s;i|tion of a Cap of E&s;tate, and a Coronet on the Princes Head, as a Token of his Principality; by delivering into his hand a Verge of Gold, the Emblem of Government; by putting a Gold Ring on his Finger, in token that he mu&s;t be a Husband to his Country, and a Father to her Children; and by giving him a Patent, to hold the &s;aid Principality to Him and his Heirs Kings of England. By which Words the Se|paration of it from the Crown is prohibited, and the King keeps to him&s;elf an excellent Oc|ca&s;ion
<PB N="124" REF="263">of obliging unto Him his Son, when he plea&s;es.</P>

<P>The Mantle worn in Parliament by the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> has (for Di&s;tinctions &s;ake) one gard more than a Duke's; his Coronet, of Cro&s;&s;es and Flower de luces, and his Cap of State in|dented.</P>

<P>Though he is a Subject, yet the Law looks upon his Per&s;on as &s;o Sacred, that it is high Trea&s;on to imagine his Death, or violate his Wife.</P>
<PB N="125" REF="263">
<P>The <HI>Younger Sons</HI> of <HI>England</HI> depend altoge|ther upon the King's Favour, both for Titles, of Honour, and Revenues &s;utable to their Birch.

<ITEM>The Lord <HI>High Admiral.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The Lord <HI>High Steward</HI> of <HI>England</HI> is the highe&s;t Officer under the King. His Office not unlike that of the <HI>Mayre of the Pallace</HI> under the ancient Kings of France, is to rule and govern the Kingdom under the King, in Time of Peace and War, during his Reign, Which Power being thought too large and exorbitant for a Subject to have, this Great Officer has been di&s;continned ever &s;ince <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Bullingbrock,</HI> Son to John of Gaunt, Duke of Lanca&s;ter, afterwards King of England under the Name of Henry IV. Only at a Co|ronation, al&s;o for the Trial of a Peer or Peere&s;s for Trea&s;on or Felony, or &s;ome other great Crime, the King makes a High Steward for
<PB N="127" REF="264">that Time. Who, during his Steward&s;hip, is called <HI>His Grace;</HI> and bears a <HI>white Staff</HI> in his hand, which he openly breaks when the Bu&s;ine&s;s is over, and &s;o ends his Of|fice.</P>
<P>By virtue of his Office at a Coronation, he &s;its Judicially at the King's Pallace at We&s;t|min&s;ter. Where he receives the Bills and Petiti|ons of all &s;uch Noblemen and others, who (by rea&s;on of their Tenure, or otherwi&s;e) claim to do Services at the King's Coronation, and to receive the accu&s;tomed Fees and Allowances. In the Proce&s;&s;ion on the Coronation-Day, 'tis he that carries the King's Crown. The Right Honourable the Earl of Devon&s;hire was ho|noured with this great Office in the la&s;t Coro|nation.</P>
<P>Upon the Trial of a Peer he &s;its under a Cloth of State, and his Commi&s;&s;ion is to pro|ceed <HI>&s;ecundum Legem &amp; Con&s;uetudinem Angliae.</HI> He is not Sworn, nor the Lords who are the Tryers of the Peer arraigned; and, tho he call all the Judges of the Land to a&s;&s;i&s;t him; yet he is the &s;ole Judge.</P>
<P>Next to the Lord High Steward is the <HI>Lord High Chancellour,</HI> who in Civil Affairs (now there is no High Steward) is the highe&s;t Per|&s;on in the Kingdom next to the Royal Family, as the Arch-bi&s;hop of Canterbury is in Eccle|&s;ia&s;tical.</P>
<P>His Oath is to do Right to all manner of People, rich and poor, after the Laws and Cu&s;toms of the Realm, truly to coun&s;el the King, and keep &s;ecret the King's Coun&s;el, to &s;tand for the Rights of the Crown, &amp;c.</P>
<PB N="128" REF="265">
<P>The Great Seal of England is in his Cu|&s;tody. He is the Judge of the Court of Chan|cery, otherwi&s;e called the Court of Equity; where he is to judge, not according to the Rigour and Letter of the Law, but with Equi|ty and Con&s;cience. He al&s;o be&s;tow's all Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical Benefices in the King's Gift under 20 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> a Year in the King's Books.</P>
<P>Since the Reign of Henry VII. this great Office has been commonly executed by Lawyers; whereas formerly Bi&s;hops, and other Clergy|men learned in the Civil Laws, were u&s;ually intru&s;ted with it.</P>
<P>The Lord High Chancellour holds his Place but <HI>durante Regis Beneplacito,</HI> during the King's Plea&s;ure. And his Place is counted to be worth 8000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> a Year.</P>
<P>Anciently he had &s;ometimes a Vice-Chan|cellour, commonly called Keeper of the Great Seal. But of later Times they differ only in Name. For the late Kings have always be|flowed the Great Seal, either with the Title of Lord Keeper, or of Lord Chancellour; but &s;till with the &s;ame Power, and Right of Pre|cedence. Only the Lord Chancellour re|ceives a Patent from the King for his Office, which the Lord Keeper do's not; and by the Title of Chancellour he is lookt upon as in greater favour with the King.</P>
<P>But his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, &s;ince his Acce&s;&s;ion to the Crown, thought fit to have this Office managed by Commi&s;&s;ioners; and accordingly it has been hitherto managed by <HI>three Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners.</HI></P>
<P>The third Great Officer of the Crown is the <HI>Lord High Trea&s;urer,</HI> who has the Charge and
<PB N="129" REF="265">Government of all the King's Revenue kept in the Exchequer.</P>
<P>He has the Gift of all Cu&s;tomers, Comptro|lers, and Searchers in all the Ports of Eng|land; and the Nomination of all E&s;cheators in every County. He has al&s;o the Check of all the Officers imploy'd in collecting all the Re|venues of the Crown. He has power either by him&s;elf, or with others joyned in Commi&s;|&s;ion with him, to let Lea&s;es of all the Crown-Lands. And it is he that gives Warrants to certain Per&s;ons of Quality, to have their Wine Cu&s;tom-free.</P>
<P>Anciently he received this Office and Dig|nity by the delivery of the golden Keys of the Trea&s;ury, which is now done by deli|very of a white Staff to him by the King.</P>
<P>His Oath do's not differ much from that of the Lord Chancellour; and he holds his Place, as he do's, during his Maje&s;ties Plea&s;ure. His Place is al&s;o reckoned to be worth 8000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> <HI>per ann.</HI></P>
<P>But this great Office is now executed by four Per&s;ons, called the <HI>Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Trea&s;ury.</HI></P>
<P>Next is the <HI>Lord Pre&s;ident of the King's Privy Council,</HI> an Officer as ancient as King John's Time, made by the King's Letters Patent under the Great Seal, <HI>durante Beneplacito.</HI> His Office is to manage the Debates in Council, to pro|po&s;e Matters from the King, and report the Tran&s;actions to his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>In the late Reigns this Office was often &s;up|plied by the Chancellour.</P>
<P>Next to the Lord Pre&s;ident is the <HI>Lord Privy Seal,</HI> who&s;e Office is of great Tru&s;t and Skill. He is &s;o called from the Privy Seal,
<PB N="130" REF="266">which is in his cu&s;tody. All Charters and Grants of the King, and all Pardons &s;igned by the King, pa&s;s through his hands, before they come to the Great Seal of England. And h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> ought not to put this Seal to any Grant, with<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> out good Warrant under the King's Privy Signet; nor with Warrant, if it be again&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Law or Cu&s;tom, until the King be fir&s;t ac|quainted. He manages al&s;o divers other Mat|ters of le&s;s concernment, which do not pa&s;s the Great Seal.</P>
<P>He is, by his Place, of the King's Privy Council, and takes his Oath accordingly; be&s;ides a particular Oath, as Lord Privy Seal. Whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> there is a Court of Reque&s;ts, he is the chie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Judge of it.</P>

<P>The &s;ixth Great Officer of the Crown i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the <HI>Lord Great Chamberlain of England,</HI> an Of|ficer of State, and of great Antiquity, who&s;e chief Bu&s;ine&s;s is on the Coronation-Day. For it is his Office that Day to bring the King his Shirt, Coyf, and Wearing Cloaths before his Maje&s;ty ri&s;es; and to carry at the Coronation the Coyf, Gloves, and Linnen to be u&s;ed by the King upon that Occa&s;ion. In the Church where the King is Crowned he undre&s;&s;es and attires his Maje&s;ty with Robes Royal, and give<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Him the Gold which is offered by Him at the Altar. Before and after Dinner he &s;erves the King with Water, to wa&s;h his hands.</P>
<P>For this Service he has 40 Ells of Cri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|&s;on Velver for-his own Robes, the King's Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and all the Furniture of his Bed-Chamber all the King's Night-Apparel, and the Ba&s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and Towels u&s;ed at Dinner, for his Fees.</P>
<PB N="131" REF="266">
<P>He has al&s;o Livery and Lodging in the King's Court, certain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ees from all Peers of the Realm at their Creation, and from each Arch-Bi&s;hop or Bi&s;hop when they do their Ho|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">age or Fealty to the King.</P>
<P>To him belongs the Care of providing all Things in the Hou&s;e of Lords in Parliament-Time, and therefore has an Apartment al|lowed him near the Hou&s;e of Lords.</P>
<P>This Office is Hereditary, and belongs to the Earls of Lind&s;ey.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lord High Con&s;table</HI> is another great Of|ficer, but of too great Authority and Power to be continued, and therefore is only created for the Solemnity of the King's Coronation. The Duke of Ormond was High Con&s;table in the la&s;t.</P>
<P>The next is the <HI>Earl Mar&s;hal of England,</HI> an Of|ficer of great Antiquity, and anciently of great Power. His proper Office is to &s;ummon the Nobi|lity to the King's Coronation, with &s;uch Directi|ons for State and publick Appearance as be|comes that Solemnity. He al&s;o takes Cogni|zance of Matters of War and Arms out of the reach of the Common Law, and in the&s;e Matters he is commonly guided by the Civil Law. Neither can any obtain a Coat of Arms, but he mu&s;t fir&s;t apply him&s;elf to the Earl Mar&s;hal, to whom the Heralds Colledge is &s;ubordinate.</P>
<P>The la&s;t is the <HI>Lord High Admiral of Eng|land;</HI> an Office held by Patent, and of &s;o great a Tru&s;t, that it has u&s;ually been given to Princes of the Royal Bloud.</P>
<PB N="132" REF="267">
<P>For the Lord High Admiral is Intru&s;ted with no le&s;s than the Management of all Mari|time Affairs, with the Government of the King's Navy, with Power of Deci&s;ion in all Cau&s;es Maritime, a&s;well Civil as Criminal, of all Things done upon or beyond the Sea in any Part of the World, in all Ports and Ha|vens, upon the Sea-Coa&s;ts, and all Rivers be|low the fir&s;t Bridge next towards the Sea. In &s;hort, the Admiralty being in a manner a &s;eparate Kingdom from the re&s;t, the Lord High Admiral may be reputed at lea&s;t the Vice|roy thereof.</P>
<P>A Multitude of Officers high and low are under him, both at Sea and Land; &s;ome of a Military, others of a Civil Capacity; &s;ome Judicial, others Mini&s;terial. And under him is held the High Court of Admiralty, the Places and Offices whereof are in his Gift.</P>
<P>The la&s;t High Admiral of England was the late King, when Duke of York. For, &s;ince he came to the Crown, the Office was executed by Seven Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners, as it is to this day.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of Their pre&s;ent Maje&s;ties, King</HI> WILLIAM <HI>and Queen</HI> MARY, <HI>With a brief Account of Their Acce&s;&s;ion to the Crown.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>KING <HI>WILLIAM,</HI> our pre&s;ent Mo|narch, is the only I&s;&s;ue of the late Il|lu&s;trious Prince <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Na&s;&s;aw,</HI> Prince of Orange, and of the Decea&s;ed Prin|ce&s;s Royal <HI>Mary,</HI> elde&s;t Daughter to King Charles I, who was wedded to the fore&s;aid Prince in the Year 1641.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty was born in Holland Nov. 4th 1650, ten days after his Fathers Death; and was Chri&s;tened by the Names of <HI>William Henry, William</HI> being his Fathers Name, and <HI>Henry</HI> his Grandfathers.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of <HI>Na&s;&s;aw</HI> is an Ancient and mo&s;t Illu&s;trious Family, &s;o called from <HI>Na&s;&s;aw,</HI> a Town and County in <HI>Weteravia</HI> a Province of Germany. That Branch of it from whence the King is de&s;cended had their u&s;ual Seat at <HI>Dillenburg,</HI> not far from <HI>Na&s;&s;aw,</HI> before they &s;ettled in the Low-Countries; whence, for Di&s;tinctions &s;ake, they were named the Earls of <HI>Na&s;&s;aw</HI> of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Dillenburg.</HI></P>
<PB N="134" REF="268">
<P><HI>Otho</HI> of <HI>Na&s;&s;aw,</HI> who died Anno 1190, was the Founder of the pre&s;ent Family of the Princes of <HI>Orange;</HI> out of which de&s;cended <HI>Adolph,</HI> Earl of <HI>Na&s;&s;aw,</HI> who was cho&s;en Em|perour in the Year 1292. By the Marriage of <HI>Engelbert,</HI> the &s;eventh Earl of this Hou&s;e, with Mary Daughter and Heir of Philip Lord of <HI>Breda</HI> in Brabant, that Town and Barony, with many other fair E&s;tates in the Nether|lands was added to the Family. And by the Marriage of <HI>Henry</HI> (the tenth Earl of <HI>Na&s;&s;aw</HI>) Anno 1515. with Claude of Chalons, Si&s;ter and Heir of Philibert Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> this Principality, bordering upon Provence and Dau|phene within the Dominions of France, ac|crued to the Family. So much the wor&s;e for having &s;o ill an Neighbour as the pre&s;ent French King, who has long &s;ince rapaciou&s;ly &s;eized upon it; but left however what he could not take away, the King's ju&s;t Title to it.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, our Gracious King William is the 18th Earl of <HI>Na&s;&s;aw,</HI> beginning with Otho afore&s;aid; and the 7th Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> of his Family, beginning with Rene of Na&s;&s;aw, Son of Henry and Claude, who &s;ucceeded Philibert his Uncle in the Principality of Orange.</P>
<P>A Family as much honoured for the per|&s;onal Merit of the Princes of it as any other in Europe, and to which the States of Hol|land ow the Liberty and Greatne&s;s they injoy. All the World knows how great a Patron and A&s;&s;ertor of the Belgick Liberties again&s;t the Spaniard was the mo&s;t noble and generous Prince <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Na&s;&s;aw,</HI> one of his Maje&s;tie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Ance&s;tors. And, to pa&s;s by the generous Ex|ploits
<PB N="135" REF="268">of his noble Succe&s;&s;ors till the pre&s;ent King William, 'tis well known what his Ma|je&s;tly has done to re&s;cue, not only his Native Country, but the be&s;t Part of Europe from its Oppre&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>It has been of late Years, both at home and abroad, the Maxim of &s;ome Princes, to outvy each other in preying upon and de&s;troy|ing not only their Neighbours, but their own Prote&s;tant Subjects, by all Methods of Perfidi|ou&s;ne&s;s and Cruelty. To e&s;tabli&s;h or maintain their Tyranny, they went about to introduce a general Ignorance. For where Subjects part with their Rea&s;on, 'tis ea&s;y for them to part with their Liberty; witne&s;s tho&s;e mi&s;erable In&s;laved Countries where Popery domineers.</P>
<P>On the contrary the Hou&s;e of Orange has always appeared again&s;t that ravenous and in|humane Principle. And, as if Providence had appointed them for a Check to Tyranny, God has been plea&s;ed accordingly to ble&s;s their ju&s;t Indeavours.</P>
<P>Never the Liberty of England, and the Pro|te&s;tant Intere&s;t in general, lay more at &s;take than it did in the late Reign. 'Tis plain there was a general De&s;ign to extirpate Here|ly in a Popi&s;h Sen&s;e, and to in&s;lave all Eu|rope. The Plot was laid in the Reign of <HI>ble&s;&s;ed</HI> King Charles, who with a &s;hew of Pro|te&s;lanti&s;m made the Way &s;mooth for Pope|ry. At la&s;t, when all Things were finely prepared to the hand of his next Heir, King Charles go's off the Stage; and his Brother, to play the la&s;t Act, enters, and a&s;cends the Throne.</P>
<P>No Prince more Courteous, more Obliging, or more Promi&s;ing at fir&s;t than He was to his
<PB N="136" REF="269">new Subjects. The Church of England Trium|phed in his Exaltation, and Addre&s;&s;ed Him from all Parts of the Kingdom, as their Tutela<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Angel. The People in general look'd upon him as an Incomparable Hero, who would quickly make it his Bu&s;ine&s;s to pull down the Hector of France, and <HI>to carry the Glory of Eng|land beyond all his Predece&s;&s;ors.</HI> In &s;hort, &s;o great were the Hopes of this King, that Ed|ward III, and Henry V, the mo&s;t glorious Mo|narchs of England, were upon his Account to be hi&s;&s;ed out of our Engli&s;h Chronicles.</P>
<P>No body dreamed of a <HI>Popi&s;h Catechi&s;m,</HI> to be the fir&s;t &s;tep to this Glory, nor of an Army to be rai&s;ed for the defence of it. Under who&s;e &s;helter, be&s;ides a &s;ecret League with France, the Prerogative began pre&s;ently to &s;well above its Banks, the Laws to be Overwhelmed the Liberty and Property of the Subject Invaded, the Church of England Cru&s;hed that had rai&s;ed the King to the Throne, Popery crowing over all the Nation, and to crown all their Hopes, <HI>pre&s;to,</HI> a Prince of Wales. In &s;hort, to &s;peak in terms of War, the Miner was fix'd, and we mu&s;t ei|ther Surrender, or be Stormed.</P>
<P>This was our Condition, when the Prince of Orange (our pre&s;ent King) undertook our De|liverance, and effected it, under God, in a mi|raculous manner. Upon who&s;e Approach our <HI>Ma&s;s-Hero</HI> fled, left us to &s;hift for our &s;elves, and the Popi&s;h Party to the mercy of the Rab|ble.

Whil&s;t they work upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ody, &s;he works upon the Soul. They pull one way, &s;he another; and &s;o they divide the Spoil, making a Prey of the People every where. Therefore, if the Engli&s;h Papi&s;ts under&s;tand their true Intere&s;t, as their Wi&s;e Ance&s;tors did, they ought to &s;tand for the Engli&s;h Liberty, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ong as they can have any Indulgence in matter of Religion.</P>
<P>But, be&s;ides the Roman Catholicks, which are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">deed the mo&s;t excu&s;able in this Ca&s;e, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ould have imagined that <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> &s;hould be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">anable of le&s;&s;ening them&s;elves their own Hap|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ine&s;s in this Change?

<PB N="146" REF="274">their Way, without Mole&s;tation. This Liberty they got &s;ince this Change by Act of Parliament, with the ready Concurrence of the Church of England Members, and the King's A&s;&s;ent to it; but now it won't &s;erve their turn. If nothing will plea&s;e them but to &s;ee a Church run down that &s;tood alone at the Gap in the late Reign, that &s;o learnedly baffled all the Popi&s;h Writers, and was therefore by a Roman Decree to be &s;tript of all, and de&s;troyed, when the Di&s;&s;en|ters were much in favour in that Court, God forbid they &s;hould ever be plea&s;ed. The King knows who are the be&s;t Friends to the Crown, and upon whom he may &s;afely rely. He loves all his Subjects, but perhaps not all alike.</P>
<P>The Mi&s;chief is, that &s;ome of our <HI>Churchmen</HI> are al&s;o out of Humour, or rather out of order. One lies &s;ick of a Scruple of Con&s;cience, another langui&s;hes in love with King James, a third is e'en di&s;tracted betwixt a King <HI>De Jure</HI> and a King <HI>De Facto.</HI> But tho&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es (I thank God) are not &s;o Epidemical, as to indanger a Convul&s;ion in the State. There are excellent and approved Remedies for them in the <HI>Pa&s;to|ral Letter</HI> of the pre&s;ent Bi&s;hop of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> and in the <HI>Collection of Papers,</HI> but particularly in the late Book put out by that eminent Divine <HI>Dr. Sherlock,</HI> to which for brevity &s;ake I refer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Di&s;ea&s;ed.

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the pre&s;ent KING and Q&V;EEN's Court.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THeir Maje&s;ties Court is compo&s;ed of two di&s;tinct Bodies, one of Laymen, another of Churchmen. I &s;hall begin with the fir&s;t, not out of any Di&s;re&s;pect to the &s;econd, but becau&s;e this &s;eems to me the mo&s;t proper and natural Method.</P>
<P>The Court-Laymen are &s;ubdivided into two di&s;tinct Parts, Civil and Military.</P>
<P>But, before we de&s;cend to Particulars, 'tis to be ob&s;erved,</P>
<P N="1">I. That the Court, wherever it is, has within it &s;elf a certain Latitude of Juri&s;diction, called the <HI>Verge of the Court;</HI> which is every way within 12 miles of the chief Tunnel of the Court, except London, which is exempted by Charter.</P>
<P N="2">II. That the King's Court, or Pallace where is Maje&s;ty re&s;ides, is counted &s;o &s;acred a Place, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">at not only Striking of any one there in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;&s;ion is &s;everely forbidden, but al&s;o all Oc|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;ions of Striking. The fir&s;t, by the ancient <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aws of England, was puni&s;hed with Death, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d Lo&s;s of Goods. And to this day, who|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">er pre&s;umes to &s;trike another within the Pal|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce where the King's Per&s;on re&s;ides, and does <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> draw blood by his Stroke, is liable, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">thout His Maje&s;ties Pardon, to lo&s;e his right
<PB N="148" REF="275">Hand, to be Fined at the King's Will, and ly in Pri&s;on till the Fine be paid. And, further to deter any one from pre&s;uming to Strike in the King's Court, the Puni&s;hment for it is executed with great Ceremony.</P>
<P N="3">III. That, as great as the Court is, yet it falls much &s;hort of what it has been formerly, whe|ther we con&s;ider the prodigious Plenty the Court lived in, or the Greatne&s;s of the Hou&s;hold. The Diminution whereof was fir&s;t occa&s;ioned by the Troubles in the Reign of Charles I, continued by Charles his Son and made greater by the late King James. Before the Troubles afore&s;aid, this Court went far beyond all others in Plenty and Magnificence, no le&s;s than 86 Tables being kept here, furni&s;hed in all with about 500 Di&s;hes each Meal, with all Things &s;utable. A Pro|fu&s;ene&s;s (I confe&s;s) becoming the Times, when the Engli&s;h were more addicted to Fea&s;ting, than they are at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>But, to come to the pre&s;ent State of the Court, the King's Hou&s;hold is managed in chief by the&s;e three principal Officers; who&s;e re&s;pec|tive Salaries I have annexed. Viz.</P>

<P>He is a <HI>White-Staff Officer,</HI> and the White|&s;taff is taken for a Commi&s;&s;ion. In the King's Pre&s;ence he holds it up in his hand; and at o|ther times, when he goes abroad, 'tis carried by a Footman bare-headed. Upon the King's Death, he breaks his Staff over the King's Her&s;e, and thereby di&s;charges all Court-Officers under him.</P>
<P>By his Office, without any Commi&s;&s;ion, he judges of all Trea&s;ons, Murders, Felonies, and Bloud&s;heds committed in the Court, or within the Verge. Which is much for the King's Honour, that where His Maje&s;ty is, no Ju&s;tice &s;hould be &s;ought but immediately from his own Officers.</P>

<P>Their Office in the <HI>Compting Hou&s;e</HI> is there to &s;it day by day, to take (as I &s;aid before) the Accompts for all Expences of the King's Hou&s;hold, to make Provi&s;ions for it, to make the Payments, and &s;uch Orders as they think fit for the Servants</P>
<P>In &s;hort, to Them is committed the Charge and Government of the King's Hou&s;e; with Power to correct all the Servants therein that &s;hall any way offend, and to keep the Peace not only within it, but within the Verge of the Court. And, whereas the King's Servants are free from Arre&s;t, the Creditors of &s;uch as are backward to pay have no other way for Payment, but to make their application to the Board of <HI>Green Cloth,</HI> which upon hearing of the Matter, take care to &s;ee Ju&s;tice done to the Creditors.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Lord Steward</HI>'s Ab&s;ence, the <HI>Trea&s;urer</HI> has power, with the <HI>Comptroller,</HI> and <HI>Steward of the Mar&s;hal&s;ea,</HI> (by virtue of their Office, and without Commi&s;&s;ion) to hear and determine

<P>The <HI>Comptroller's</HI> Office is to Comptrol the Accounts of the Green Cloth.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cofferer</HI> pays the Wages to the King's Servants, above and below Stairs; and for the Hou&s;hold Provi&s;ions, according to the Allow|ance and Direction of the Green Cloth. He has al&s;o a particular Charge and Over&s;ight of the inferiour Officers of the King's Hou&s;e.</P>

<P>Under the Dean there is a <HI>Sub-Dean,</HI> or <HI>Pra|centor Capellae;</HI> and next to him 12 <HI>Prie&s;ts.</HI> Whereof ones peculiar Office is to read the fir&s;t Morning Prayers to the Kings Hou&s;hold, to vi&s;it the Sick, to examine and prepare Com|municants, and to do all other Duties-proper for his Station.</P>
<P>Next to the Prie&s;ts there are 20 Gentle|men, commonly called the <HI>Gentlemen</HI> (or <HI>Clerks</HI>) <HI>of the Chappel;</HI> who, with the afore|&s;aid Prie&s;ts, perform in the Chappel the Office of Divine Service in Praying, Singing, &amp;c.

<P>Moreover, for the Service of the Chappel, there are 12 <HI>Children</HI> in Ordinary, who make up the Mu&s;ical Choir. The&s;e are in&s;tructed in the Rules and Art of Mu&s;ick by one of the able&s;t Clerks, who is allowed con&s;iderably for their Board and his Teaching.</P>
<P>Here are al&s;o attending the Chappel, four Of|ficers, called <HI>Vergers,</HI> from the Silver. Rods which they carry in their Hands.

<P>For the Preaching part, the King has no le&s;s than 48 <HI>Chaplains</HI> in Ordinary, who are u&s;ual|ly eminent Doctors in Divinity, and mo&s;t Deans or Prebends. The&s;e are under the particular Charge and Direction of the Lord Chamber|lain, who appoints them the Time for their Service at Court, being to wait four of them

<P>And, as Lent is a particular Time of the Year for Devotion (tho it is not ob&s;erved in England with that Strictne&s;s and Super&s;tition as it is in the Roman States) &s;o the Royal Chappel &s;hews an excellent Example, at that time e&s;pecially, to all other Churches and Chappels of England.</P>
<P>In order to which the Lord Chamberlain, &s;ome time before Lent, do's appoint the <HI>Lent-Preachers,</HI> and cau&s;es a Li&s;t of them to be printed, with their re&s;pective Times for Preaching during Lent. Then the Sermon-Days are Wedne&s;days, Fridays, and Sundays, Weekly. The fir&s;t Wedne&s;day, being A&s;h-Wedne&s;day, is fixt for the <HI>Dean of the Chappel</HI> to preach before the King; and the Friday after for the <HI>Dean of S.

<P>Upon Chri&s;tmas, Ea&s;ter, and Whit&s;unday, the King and. Queen do u&s;ually receive the Holy Sacrament, only with &s;ome of the Royal Fa|mily, and two or three of the principal Bi&s;hops.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e are three Days of twelve in the Year, on which Their Maje&s;ties, attended with the principal Nobility adorned with their Colla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of the Garter, together with &s;ome of the He|ralds in their rich Coats, make in a grave &s;o|demn manner their Offering of Gold at the
<PB N="172" REF="288">Altar, which by the Dean of the Chappel is di&s;tributed afterwards among the Poor. The &s;ame is a Sum of Gold, to this day called the <HI>Be&s;ant,</HI> or the <HI>Bizantine,</HI> from <HI>Bizantium</HI> the old Name of Con&s;tantinople, where the piece of Gold was coined which anciently was Of|fered by the Kings of England. The Gold to be offered is delivered to the King and Queen by the Lord Steward, or &s;ome other of the principal Officers; and it is Offered to God by Their Maje&s;ties, as an Acknowledgement that by his Grace They hold their Kingdoms of him.</P>
<P>The other Days of the Year on which they make the &s;ame Offering, are All-Saints, New-Years Day, Candlemas, Annunciation, A&s;cen|&s;ion Day, S. John the Bapti&s;t, and Michaelmas Day, when only Gold is offered. To which add Twelfth Day, when Gold, Frankincen&s;e, and Myrrh are Offered by the King in &s;everal Pur&s;es.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lord Almoner</HI> is u&s;ually a Bi&s;hop. Who&s;e Office is to di&s;po&s;e of the Moneys allowed by the King for Alms, of all Deodands, and Goods of Self Murderers, forfeited to the King, and always be&s;towed in Alms to the Poor. He has the Priviledge to give the King's Di&s;h, that is, the fir&s;t Di&s;h at Dinner, which is &s;et upon the King's Table, to what&s;oever Poor-man he plea&s;es, or Mony in lieu thereof upon his Maje&s;ties account. Wherever the Court re|&s;ides, 24 Poor men are nominated by the Offi|cers of the adjacent Pari&s;h, among whom Mony, Bread, and Beer, or all Mony, is equally divi|ded at the Court Gate by the Lord Almoner Order at 7 of the Clock every Morning. And it has been the Cu&s;tom for every Poor-man, be|fore he received the Alms, to repeat the Cre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">

Be&s;ides, there are many poor Pen|&s;ioners to the King and Queen below Stairs, who have a Competency duly paid unto them by the Almoner. And, when the King is in his Progre&s;s, his Lord&s;hip, or his Sub-Almoner for him, is to &s;catter new-coined Two-pences in the Towns and Places where the King pa&s;&s;es through in his Progre&s;s, to a certain Sum by the Year&punc; The <HI>Lord Almoner</HI> is to &s;ee all the&s;e Things done; for the Performance whereof he has 3 Officers allowed under him, to wit a <HI>Sub-Almoner,</HI> a <HI>Yeoman,</HI> and a <HI>Groom.</HI> And for that purpo&s;e there is at Court a parti|cular Office, from hence called the <HI>Almon|ry.</HI></P>
<P>On Maundy Thur&s;day, (being the Thur&s;|day before Ea&s;ter) &s;o called from the French <HI>Mande</HI> a &s;ort of Basket, is performed the Ce|remony of Wa&s;hing the Feet of as many Poor|men as the Years the King has reigned. Which is done &s;ometimes by the King him|&s;elf, and in his ab&s;ence by the <HI>Lord Almoner;</HI> a piece of Humility taken from the Pattern of our Saviour. When the Poor-mens Feet are wa&s;hed, he wipes them with a Towel. Then he gives every one of them for Cloathing two Yards and a half of Woollen-Cloth, Linnen-Cloth for Two Shirts, a pair of Shoes, and a pair of Stockings. For Eating, &s;ix Peny-loaves of Bread, with 3 Di&s;hes of Fi&s;h in Platters; whereof one of Salt Salmon, another of green Fi&s;h or Cod, the third of pickle or red Her|rings, or red Sprats. For Drink, a Gallon of Beer, and a Quart bottle of Wine. And, for Pocket Mony, a red-leather Pur&s;e, with as ma|ny &s;ingle Pence as the King is Years old; and,

<P>La&s;tly, the King has a <HI>Clerk of the Clo&s;et,</HI> who is commonly a reverend, &s;ober, and learn|ed Divine. His Office is to attend at the King's right hand during Divine Service, to re&s;olve all Doubts concerning Spiritual Matters, and to wait on his Maje&s;ty in his Clo&s;et or private Oratory.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dean of the Chappel's</HI> Fee is 200 l. Yearly, and a Table; the <HI>Sub-Dean's,</HI> 100; the <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Clerks of the Chappel,</HI> each 70 l.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lord Almoner</HI> has no Fee. The <HI>Sub-Almoner</HI> has but 6 l. 18. &s;h. a Year. But the <HI>Yeoman</HI> has 30, and the <HI>Groom</HI> 20 l. a Year.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of their pre&s;ent</HI> Maje&s;ties <HI>Land and Sea Forces, and the Ma|nagement thereof.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THeir Maje&s;ties Land-Forces are either <HI>Ordinary,</HI> as the Hor&s;e and Foot Guards, the &s;everal Garri&s;ons, and the &s;tanding Militia of the Country. Or <HI>Ex|traordinary,</HI> as the pre&s;ent victorious Army in Ireland.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hor&s;e</HI> and <HI>Foot-Guards</HI> I have already de|&s;cribed in the foregoing Account of the King and Queens Court, where it appears they a|mount to 7000 Men at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>The principal <HI>Garri&s;oned Places</HI> in England are <HI>Port&s;mouth, Plimouth,</HI> the <HI>Tower of London, Wind|&s;or-Ca&s;tle, Che&s;ter, Carli&s;le, Hull, Berwick, Do|ver-Ca&s;tle,</HI> and the&s;e two Forts on the Thames, <HI>Sheerne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Tilbury.</HI></P>
<P>In the I&s;le of Wight there are con&s;tant Gar|ri&s;ons, at <HI>Cowes, Sandham Fort, We&s;t-Yarmouth,</HI> and <HI>Carisbrook.</HI> So there is at <HI>Hur&s;t</HI> and <HI>Cal&s;hot Ca&s;tles,</HI> upon two Points of Hamp&s;hire &s;hoot|ing forth into the Sea over again&s;t the &s;aid I&s;le. To which add <HI>Upner Ca&s;tle</HI> in Kent, <HI>Landguard Fort</HI> in Suffolk, <HI>Clifford Tower</HI> and <HI>Scarborough Ca&s;tle</HI> in York&s;hire, <HI>Tinmouth Ca&s;tle</HI> in Northumberland, and <HI>Holy I&s;land</HI> near the Coa&s;t of that County, <HI>S. Maries Ca&s;tle</HI> among
<PB N="178" REF="291">the I&s;les of Scilly, <HI>Pendennis</HI> in Cornwal, and <HI>Portland Ca&s;tle</HI> in Dor&s;et&s;hire. Be&s;ides the I&s;lands of <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> and <HI>Garn&s;ey,</HI> on the Coa&s;t of Normandy.</P>
<P>The Number of Men in each of tho&s;e Gar|ri&s;ons is uncertain; for it is greater or le&s;&s;er, as Occa&s;ion &s;erves. Mo&s;t of them are unregimen|ted Companies.</P>
<P>The&s;e, together with the Royal Guards, be|ing the &s;tanding Land-Forces in Their Ma|je&s;ties Pay, there is for the Paying of them, fir&s;t a general Officer, called the <HI>Pay-Ma&s;ter General,</HI> who has &s;everal Clerks under him.</P>
<P>Next is the <HI>Commi&s;&s;ary General of the Mu&s;ters,</HI> who has a <HI>Deputy Commi&s;&s;ary</HI> in London; be&s;ides eight other <HI>Deputy-Commi&s;&s;aries,</HI> who have their di&s;tinct Circuits in the Country, for Mu&s;tering the Forces which lye in the &s;everal Garri&s;ons.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o a <HI>Secretary at War,</HI> with &s;everal Clerks, and a Me&s;&s;enger under him.</P>
<P>Which three con&s;iderable Offices are kept at the Hor&s;e-Guard.</P>
<P>Moreover, there is a <HI>Judge Advocate,</HI> a <HI>Scout-Ma&s;ter General,</HI> an <HI>Adjutant General,</HI> and a <HI>Mar&s;hal of the Hor&s;e;</HI> be&s;ides a <HI>Chirurgeon Ge|neral.</HI></P>
<P>Among&s;t Their Maje&s;ties Land Forces we may reckon the <HI>Militia,</HI> or <HI>Train Bands</HI> of e|very County, as being wholly at the King's Di&s;po&s;al, and bound to A&s;&s;i&s;t Him upon all Occa&s;ions within the Bounds of the Realm.</P>
<P>In Queen Elizabeth's Time a general Mu&s;ter was made, by her Order, of all Men able to bear Arms, from the Age of 16 to 60; who
<PB N="179" REF="291">then amounted to three Millions of Men, whereof &s;ix hundred Thou&s;and fit for War. But, in Time of Peace, the Matter is &s;o regu|lated, that there is not above one hundred thou|&s;and Hor&s;e and Foot actually Inrolled for the Defence of the Realm.</P>
<P>The Management whereof is in the hands of the <HI>Lord Lieutenants</HI> of the &s;everal Counties of England, who are u&s;ually of the principal Rank among&s;t the Peers of the Realm, cho&s;en for that purpo&s;e by the King, and &s;o created by his Commi&s;&s;ion. They have Power by Act of Par|liament to charge any Per&s;on with Hor&s;e, Hor&s;emen, and Arms, that has 500 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a Year, or 6000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> per&s;onal E&s;tate; and with a Foot Souldier, any Per&s;on that has 50 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> yearly Re|venue, or 600 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> per&s;onal E&s;tate. Tho&s;e that have meaner E&s;tates are to joyn two or three together, either to find a Hor&s;e and Hor&s;e|man, or a Foot Souldier, according to their E|&s;tates.</P>
<P>They have al&s;o Power to Arm, Array, and Form the Forces into Companies, Troops, and Regiments, and to make their Officers by gi|ving them Commi&s;&s;ions; and, upon any Re|bellion or Inva&s;ion, to lead and imploy the Men &s;o Armed within their re&s;pective Coun|ties, or into any other County, as the King &s;hall give Order.</P>
<P>They name their <HI>Deputy Lieutenants,</HI> and pre&s;ent them to the King, for his Confirmation. Who are to be of the principal Gentry of the Country, and have the &s;ame Power as the Lord Lieutenant in his ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>To find out Ammunition and other Nece&s;|&s;aries, there is a Tax of 70000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a Month upon the whole Kingdom, whereof the Lord Lieu|tenants or Deputies, or any three (or more) of
<PB N="180" REF="292">them, may levy a Fourth Part of each Mans Proportion in it. And, when occa&s;ion &s;hall be to bring the Militia into actual Service, the Per|&s;ons &s;o charged are to provide each Souldier re|&s;pectively with pay in hand for a Month, at the rate of 2 &s;hill. a Day for a Hor&s;eman, and 12 pence for a Foot Souldier. For Repayment of which Mony, and the &s;atisfaction of the Of|ficers for their Pay, during the time afore&s;aid, Provi&s;ion is to be made by the King out of the publick Revenue; and, till the &s;ame be actually performed, none can be charged with another Months Pay.</P>
<P>The&s;e Forces are always to be in readine&s;s, with all Things nece&s;&s;ary at the beat of Drum, or &s;ound of Trumpet, to appear, mu&s;ter, and be at certain times trained and di&s;cipli|ned.</P>
<P>Now, to give &s;peedy notice of an approach|ing Inva&s;ion, there are all over England high Poles erected upon eminent Places both Inland and Maritime, with Pitch-barrels fa&s;tened on the Top, known by the name of <HI>Beacons.</HI> Which being &s;et on fire, one by the &s;ight of another, the whole Kingdom has thereby no|tice in few Hours of the approaching Danger. Whereupon the Militia, to &s;ecure the Kingdom, makes ha&s;te to the Sea-Coa&s;ts.</P>
<P>As for the pre&s;ent <HI>Army,</HI> which God has lately ble&s;t with a glorious Victory, carrying with it the Reduction of Ireland, and (I hope) a Fate upon France, it was lately Computed to be near Fifty thou&s;and &s;trong, Hor&s;e, Foot, and Dragoons; con&s;i&s;ting of Engli&s;h, Iri&s;h, French, Dani&s;h, and Dutch Forces.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h, for the &s;atisfaction of the Reader, that I could give a particular and exact Account of
<PB N="181" REF="292">this brave and gallant Army. But, rather than do it imperfectly, I beg the Reader's leave to decline it.</P>
<P>And &s;o I come to the <HI>Maritime Power</HI> of England. Which con&s;i&s;ts in general of about 130 <HI>Men of War;</HI> be&s;ides <HI>Fire&s;hips, Yachts, Hulks, Ketches, Sloops, Hays,</HI> and <HI>Smacks,</HI> and &s;eve|ral other Ve&s;&s;els for Tenders and Victual|lers.</P>
<P>The Men of War are divided into &s;ix Rates, or Ranks; Built in &s;everal Places, but mo&s;t at <HI>Woolwich, Chatham, Deptford, Blackwall, Har|wich,</HI> and <HI>Port&s;mouth.</HI></P>
<P>The following Li&s;t gives you the Names of them, according to their Rates, in the Alpha|betick Order, with the Year when they were built; al&s;o the Number of Tuns, Men, and Guns each of them commonly carries abroad in Time of War. Tho&s;e who&s;e Names be in the Roman Letter, are the Thirty that were built by an Act of Parliament made in the Year 1676.</P>

<P>The <HI>Sloops</HI> carry all 4 Guns each; the <HI>Hoys</HI> and <HI>Smacks,</HI> none.</P>
<P>Now, as to our Men of War in particular, 'tis to be ob&s;erved, that for <HI>Strength</HI> they are Incomparable, being built of Engli&s;h Timber, which is the mo&s;t excellent for that purpo&s;e.

<P>The <HI>Britannia,</HI> a new Ship, is much the &s;ame; but that &s;he was not perhaps &s;o carefully built as the Royal Sovereign, there being found late|ly &s;ome Defect in the Timber, which is now repairing.</P>
<P>As to the Charge of Building &s;o great a Ve&s;|&s;el, together with Guns, Tackle, and Rigging, be&s;ides Victualling, 'tis computed at lea&s;t to 60000 pound.

<P>The four principal Officers are the <HI>Trea&s;urer, C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mptroller, Surveyor,</HI> and <HI>Clerk of the Acts.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Trea&s;urer</HI>'s Office is to pay the Charges of the Navy out of the Exchequer, having fir&s;t a Warrant for the Mony from the Lords Com|mi&s;&s;ioners of the Trea&s;ury, and for the Pay|ment thereof another Warrant from the prin|cipal Officers of the Navy. His Allowance is 3000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a Year.</P>
<P>The <HI>Comptroller</HI>'s Office is to attend and comptroll all Payments of Wages. He is like|wi&s;e to know all the M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rket Rates of all Stores for Shipping, to audit and examine all Trea&s;u|rers, Victuallers, and Store-Keepers Accounts.

<P>The <HI>Surveyor's</HI> Bu&s;ine&s;s is to know the &s;tate of all Stores, and &s;ee their Wants &s;upplied; to &s;urvey the Hulls, Ma&s;ts, and Yards, and have their Defects repaired at rea&s;onable rates. What Stores the Boat&s;wains and Carpenters receive in order to a Voyage, he is to charge them with by Indenture; and at their return, to &s;tate and audit their Accounts. His Salary is 400 l. a Year.</P>

<P>Both the principal Officers and Commi&s;&s;ioners hold their Places by Patent, under the Great Seal of England; and have Clerks allowed to each of them, with re&s;pective Salaries, for the Di&s;patch of Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>The <HI>Commi&s;&s;ioners for Victualling the Navy</HI> are commonly four, and their Salary is each 400 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a Year.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, the Navy-Office is &s;ubordinate to the <HI>Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Admiralty,</HI> as they execute the Office of the Lord High Admiral of England; of who&s;e Power and great Privi|ledges I have already &s;poken among&s;t the Great Officers of the Crown.</P>

<P>In Wales there's but two <HI>Vice-Admiralties,</HI> one in the North, and the other in the South Parts of Wales.</P>
<P>To reflect upon what is pa&s;t relating to our Naval Force, this (I confe&s;s) was much wea|kened by the late King <HI>Charles</HI> his &s;trange Neg|lect of Shipping and Seamen, to the great di&s;|credit and damage of this Nation. Then, and not till then, the French grew upon us; and grew (like a Weed) &s;o fa&s;t, that they have been ever &s;ince a great Di&s;couragement and Ob&s;truction to our Engli&s;h Trade. To &s;ee tho&s;e Sea-Mu&s;hrooms, the French, dare be &s;o bold as to crow over the Engli&s;h, who would not have Imployed them for <HI>Swabbers</HI> &s;ome Years &s;ince, 'twere enough to inrage a &s;en&s;ible Nation. But, if one may gue&s;s at future Events from the pre&s;ent Di&s;po&s;ition of Things, I am apt to think this prodigious <HI>Gallicinium,</HI> or Crowing of the French King, is a Pre&s;age of his Fall. And, without Inquiring into the &s;e|cret Cau&s;es of the late unu&s;ual and wonderful Tamene&s;s of our Fleet, (which gave him the &s;atisfaction to rove a while undi&s;turbed in our Seas) now &s;uch Mea&s;ures are taken as will in all probability make him lower his Top-&s;ail. As for <HI>Tourville</HI> his Admiral's Exploit at <HI>Ting<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nouth,</HI> 'tis &s;uch as de&s;erves Deri&s;ion, more than a Tri|umph.
<PB N="194" REF="299"><HI>Tingmouth,</HI> a &s;mall, open, and ob&s;cure Place, the Re&s;ort of a few Fi&s;hermen who had there &s;ome Thatched Hou&s;es, was wonder|fully Stormed, and irre&s;i&s;tibly Burnt by this Victorious Fleet. Which, flu&s;hed with this great Expedition, and its happy Come-off in the Sea|fight, &s;ailed few Days after with flying Colours for <HI>Bre&s;t. Bre&s;t,</HI> which expected great Spoils from the Briti&s;h Shore, and &s;ome Return for Millions expended to make this proud Appea|rance at Sea, wondered to &s;ee nothing but their Fleet come &s;hort home; &s;ome Ships wanting, and others halting, with part of what Men they had left alive half &s;tarved, or &s;ick to death, as if they had come from <HI>Terra Incognita.</HI> But the <HI>Paris Gazette</HI> made amends, which celebrated this Expedition at that rate, that one would have thought the Venetians Victory over the Turks in the Gulf of Lepanto fell &s;hort of this paultry one. And, to rai&s;e the Credit of the great Exploit at <HI>Tingmouth,</HI> there <HI>Tingmouth</HI> was repre&s;ented as a flouri&s;hing Harbour, crowded with Men of War, and Merchant Ships richly laden, of which a Sacrifice was made to the new French Neptune. Thus, by a fal&s;e and pompous Relation (which indeed &s;ounded much to the glory of a Hamlet) the French Court de&s;igned to amu&s;e the World, to rai&s;e on the one &s;ide the Spirits of the drooping French, and at the &s;ame time &s;trike an Aw among&s;t the Confederates. Which &s;hews what &s;hifts the French are put to in this Juncture of Time, to &s;upport their Reputation.</P>
<P>What remains is to give an Account of Their Maje&s;ties <HI>Office of Ordnance,</HI> relating to their Forces both by Sea and Land, and Kept within the Tower of London. Which Office concerns
<PB N="195" REF="299">all the principal Preparatives and In&s;truments of War for the Defence and Safety of the King|dom, and has the ordering and di&s;po&s;ing of all the Magazines, as well for Sea as Land.</P>
<P>The principal of the&s;e Magazines is the <HI>Tower,</HI> where there are Arms for 60000 Men, and a fine Train of Artillery Kept, with all &s;tores proportionable.</P>
<P>This, and all other Magazines in the King|dom (as tho&s;e of <HI>Port&s;mouth, Plimouth, Wind&s;or-Ca&s;tle,</HI> &amp;c.) are under the <HI>Ma&s;ter-General of the Ordnance,</HI> a Place of great Tru&s;t, and of a general Influence over all the Kingdom.

<P>The <HI>Surveyor</HI>'s Office is to &s;urvey all Their Maje&s;ties Ordnance and Stores in the Store-Keeper's Cu&s;tody, and to &s;ee them placed to the be&s;t advantage.

<P>The <HI>Keeper of the Stores</HI> has in his particular Charge all the Ordnance and Stores.

<P>The <HI>Trea&s;urer,</HI> or <HI>Pay-Ma&s;ter,</HI> makes the Pay|ments of all the Salaries and Bills of Debt; but &s;o that no Mony is to be by him allowed to any Per&s;on, without being li&s;ted, or appointed to be paid by the Ma&s;ter General under his hand.

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of Their Maje&s;ties pre&s;ent Reve|nues, and the Management there|of.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE pre&s;ent publick Revenues of the King and Queen, as they were lately &s;ettled by King and Parliament, differ in &s;everal Points from the Settlement made in the Reign of Charles II, and Confirmed to the late King James.</P>
<P>'Tis true, the <HI>Exci&s;e</HI> (which con&s;i&s;ts in cer|tain Impo&s;itions upon Beer, Ale, and other Li|quors) is Settled upon Them for their Lives, and the Life of the Survivor of Them. But out of it a Yearly Rent of 20000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> comes to Her Royal Highne&s;s, the Prince&s;s of Denmark, and her I&s;&s;ue, during Their Maje&s;ties Lives, and the Survivor of Them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cu&s;tom</HI> upon Commodities Imported and Exported, which was &s;ettled upon King Charles II, and afterwards his Succe&s;&s;or, for their re|&s;pective Lives, is now Confined within the Term of four Years, to commence on the 24th Day of December 1690. And that great Branch of the Revenue, the <HI>Hearth-Mony,</HI> which was for ever Settled in the Crown, to the great Grievance of the People, is now lopt off by Act of Parliament, upon the King's ge|nerous
<PB N="200" REF="302">Motion, for the Relief of His Sub|jects.</P>
<P>As to Their Maje&s;ties other Revenues, I re|fer you to the Ninth Chapter.</P>
<P>Which, with the Exci&s;e and Cu&s;tom, come to above Twelve hundred thou&s;and Pound a Year, that is about 16 Millions of French Livers. A Revenue which may &s;erve in Time of Peace to Keep up the Honour of the Crown, not to in|able any Ambitious (or Over-covetous) Prince to Invade the Property and Liberty of the Eng|gli&s;h Subjects, or under a vain Pretence of his own Glory to di&s;turb the Peace and Quiet of his Neighbours. A &s;ad Experience whereof we have &s;een of late Years by the Practice of that Ambitious Monarch, the French King; who&s;e exorbitant Incomes have helped him to Cru&s;h fir&s;t his Subjects, and then mo&s;t of his Neighbours.</P>
<P>But, when the Nation is concerned in a fo|rein War, and the War grounded upon Equity and Honour, the Parliaments of England &s;el|dom fail of Supplying the King with <HI>Sub&s;idies</HI> &s;uitable to the pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion, by a Land-Tax, Poll-Mony, and &s;uch other Ways as they think mo&s;t convenient.</P>
<P>In the mean time, as the <HI>Cu&s;tom</HI> and <HI>Exci&s;e</HI> are the two principal Branches of Their Ma|je&s;ties Revenues, let us &s;ee how the &s;ame are managed, how the Products thereof come into the Exchequer, and are there di&s;po&s;ed of by &s;uch thrifty Methods, that (all Charges born) it co&s;ts the King little above 2 Shillings in the Pound.</P>
<P>For the Managing of the <HI>Cu&s;tom-Revenue,</HI> there are in the fir&s;t place at pre&s;ent <HI>Seven Com|mi&s;&s;ioners,</HI> who have the Charge and Over&s;ight
<PB N="201" REF="302">of all Their Maje&s;ties Cu&s;toms in all Ports of England. Which Cu&s;toms amount to about 600000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a Year, whereof the Port of London only pays two Thirds, that is about 400000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> Yearly</P>
<P>The &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;it day by day at the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e, London, They hold their Places by Patent from the King, and have each a Sa|lary of 1000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> <HI>per Annum.</HI></P>
<P>Under the&s;e are a great Number of Officers imployed, both at London and in the Out-Ports, &s;ome of them of con&s;iderable quality and ability. Such as <HI>Collectors, Cu&s;tomers, Comptrol|lers, Surveyors, Regi&s;ters, Searchers, Waiters.</HI> &amp;c. who&s;e due Perqui&s;ites are &s;o con&s;iderable, that to &s;ome they are more than their re&s;pective Sa|laries.

<P>And, as there are a great many Officers for Collecting the King's Revenues, &s;o there are not a few to Receive and Disbur&s;e the &s;ame, ac|cording to His Maje&s;ties Order.</P>
<P>The principal Officer is the <HI>Lord Trea&s;urer,</HI> One of the Great Officers of the Crown. Who&s;e Place is &s;ometimes, as it is at this pre&s;ent, managed by Commi&s;&s;ioners, appointed by His Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>The next is the <HI>Chancellour of the Exchequer,</HI> an Officer of great Account and Authority; who&s;e Power extends not only in the Exchequer Court, but al&s;o here, in the managing and di&s;|po&s;ing of the King's Revenue. He is Under-Trea&s;urer, has the Exchequer-Seal in his Cu&s;to|dy, and a Superintendency over the Lord Trea|&s;urer's Roll. The Places of the Comptroller of the Pipe, of the Clerk of the Pleas, the Clerk of the Nichils, and the two Prai&s;ers of the Court, be&s;ides the Seal thereof, are all in his Gift.</P>

So that when this Book was opened upon any Difference, the Cheat appeared, and Judgement was given according|ly. This Tax-book has been written above 600 Years ago, viz. in the Reign of William the Conquerour, and was &s;ix Years a making. The &s;ame is Kept under three Locks and Keys, not to be lookt into under 6 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 8 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> and for every Line tran&s;cribed is to be paid 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR></P>
<P>Under the two Chamberlains are their <HI>Depu|ties,</HI> who &s;it in the Tally-Court, where they examine the Tallies; and there is al&s;o a <HI>Tally|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">utter</HI> attending, this Way of Tallies being found by long experience to be ab&s;olutely the be&s;t Way to avoid all Cozenage in the Kings Revenue. Which is after this manner;</P>
<P>He that pays any Monies into the Exchequer receives for his Acquittance a Tally, that is, a &s;tick with Words written on it on both &s;ides, containing the Acquittance proper to expre&s;s what the Mony received is for. This being cloven a&s;under by the Deputy-Chamberlains, the Stock is delivered to the Party that paid the Mony, the Counter-&s;tock (or Counter-foil) re|maining with them. Who afterwards deliver it over to other Deputies to be Kept till it be cal|led for, and joyned with the Stock. After which they &s;end it by an Officer of their own to the Pipe, to be applied to the Di&s;charge of the Accomptant.</P>
<P>Next to the two Chamberlains is the <HI>Auditor of the Receipts,</HI> who files the Bills of the Tel|lers, whereby they charge them&s;elves with all the Monies received, and upon the Lord High
<PB N="205" REF="304">Trea&s;urer's Warrant, or the Lords High Com|mi&s;&s;ioners, draws all Orders to be &s;igned by him or them, for I&s;&s;uing forth all Monies by virtue of Privy Seals. Which Orders are recor|ded by the Clerk of the Pells, and are entred and lodged in the &s;aid Auditor's Office. He al&s;o, by Warrant of the Lord Trea&s;urer or Commi&s;&s;io|ners, makes <HI>Debenturs</HI> to the &s;everal Per&s;ons, who have Fees, Annuities, or Pen&s;ions by Let|ters Patents from the King out of the Exchequer, and directs them for Payment to the Tellers. He daily receives the &s;tate of each Teller's Ac|count, and weekly certifies the Whole to the Lord High-Trea&s;urer or Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners, who immediately pre&s;ent the Ballance to the King. Twice a Year, viz. at Lady-Day and Mi|chaelmas, he makes an Ab&s;tract of all Accounts made in the preceeding Half-Year, whereof he delivers a Copy to the Lord Trea&s;urer, and an|other to the Chancellour of the Exchequer. He keeps the &s;everal Regi&s;ters, appointed for pay|ing all Per&s;ons in cour&s;e, upon &s;everal Branches of the Kings Revenue. La&s;tly, he has five <HI>Clerks,</HI> to manage under him the e&s;tate of Monies received, disbur&s;ed, and remain|ing.</P>
<P>Next, there are <HI>four Tellers;</HI> who&s;e Office is to receive all Monies due to the King. And, though their Salary from the King be &s;mall and incon&s;iderable, yet they are bound to His Ma|je&s;ty in 20000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> Security, and Keep each of them two <HI>Clerks,</HI> who con&s;tantly attend their Offices.</P>
<P>There is moreover a <HI>Clerk of the Pells,</HI> &s;o called from <HI>Pellis</HI> a Skin, his Office being to enter every Teller's Bill into a Parchment Skin. He has two <HI>Clerks</HI> un|der

<P>And they are called the <HI>Peerage</HI> of England, becau&s;e they are all <HI>Peers;</HI> the <HI>Barons</HI> as well as the re&s;t. They have al&s;o, all of them, the Title of <HI>Lord.</HI></P>
<P>All the&s;e Honours are given by the King, who is the &s;ole Fountain of Honour; and what|ever Title a Subject of England receives from any forein Prince is not only In&s;ignificant here, but Unwarrantable by Law.</P>
<P>All <HI>Noblemen</HI> at their Creation have two En|&s;igns, which &s;ignify two Duties. Their Heads are adorned, in token that they are to a&s;&s;i&s;t their King and Country with good Coun&s;el in time of Peace; and they are girt with a Sword, as be|ing to &s;upport the King and defend the King|dom with their Lives and Fortunes in time of War.</P>

<P>All the <HI>Peers</HI> have Coronets, but with the&s;e Di&s;tinctions. A <HI>Baron</HI> has &s;ix Pearls upon the Circle; a <HI>Vi&s;count,</HI> the Circle of Pearls without number; an <HI>Earl</HI> has the Pearls rai&s;ed upon Points, and Leaves low between; a <HI>Marque&s;s,</HI> a Pearl and a Strawberry-leaf round, of equal height; and a <HI>Duke,</HI> Leaves without Pearls. On|ly the <HI>Dukes</HI> of the <HI>Royal Blood</HI> bear (like the Prince of Wales) a Coronet of Cro&s;&s;es and Flower de Luce. Which is the &s;ame with the King's, excepting the Arches, Globe, and Cro&s;s on the top of the King's Crown.</P>
<P>But the greate&s;t Di&s;tinction among&s;t the <HI>No|bles</HI> is their Parliament Robes, in their &s;everal Gards on their Mantles, and &s;hort Cloaks about their Shoulders. For a <HI>Baron</HI> has but two Gards, a <HI>Vi&s;count</HI> two and a half, an <HI>Earl</HI> three, a <HI>Mar|que&s;s</HI> three and a half, and a <HI>Duke</HI> four. Be&s;ides that the Mantle of a <HI>Duke, Marque&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Earl</HI> is faced with Ermine; that of a <HI>Vi&s;count</HI> and <HI>Ba|ron</HI> with plain white Furr.</P>
<P><HI>Dukes</HI> were at fir&s;t &s;o called <HI>a ducendo,</HI> being anciently Generals and Leaders of Armies in time of War. <HI>Marque&s;&s;es,</HI> from their Govern|ment of Marches, and Frontire-Countries. <HI>Earls,</HI> in Latine <HI>Comites,</HI> becau&s;e they had the Go|vernment of Counties. <HI>Vi&s;counts,</HI> in Latine <HI>Vice-Comites,</HI> as being A&s;&s;i&s;tants or Deputies in the Government of Counties. <HI>Barons,</HI> according to Bracton, <HI>qua&s;i Robur Belli;</HI> the &s;afety of the King and People, in Time of War, depending

<P>Anciently a <HI>Duke</HI> was made &s;o for Term of Life, then held by Lands and Fees; till Dukes came to be Titular and Hereditary. In tho&s;e Times likewi&s;e there was no Earl but had a County or Shire for his Earldom; who, for the &s;upport of his State, had the third Peny out of the Sheriffs Court, i&s;&s;uing out of all Pleas of that County whereof he was Earl. Al&s;o, tho&s;e <HI>Barons</HI> only were accounted Peers of the Realm, that held of the King <HI>per integram Baroniam,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ted of 13 Knights Fees, and one third part, that is of 400 Marks, each Knights Fee being 20 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> And whoever had &s;o much was wont to be &s;ummoned to Parliament. But then 100 Marks was as much as 2000 pounds at this day, as may be gue&s;&s;ed by comparing the Prices of Things. 'Tis true King Henry III, after he had with much ado &s;uppre&s;&s;ed his Ba|rons, called by Writ unto Parliament only &s;uch great Men as had continued loyal, or were like &s;o to be. Which Example being followed by his Succe&s;&s;ors, they only were accounted Peers of the Realm that were &s;o called by the King's &s;pecial Writ. Till <HI>Barons</HI> came to be made by Pa|tent, as well as by Writ; and at la&s;t mo&s;t by Patent, which makes it hereditary.</P>
<P>But there are <HI>Barons</HI> in England, that have no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;hare in the Peerage, as &s;uch; viz. the <HI>Barons</HI> of the Exchequer, and the Barons of the Cinque-Ports Such as the&s;e the Earls Palatines, and the Eath of England Marches, had anciently under them and &s;uch there are yet in Che&s;hire.

<P>A <HI>Duke</HI> has the Title of <HI>Grace</HI> given him; and the other <HI>Peers,</HI> that of <HI>Lord&s;hip</HI> on <HI>Honour.</HI> Accordingly we commonly give to the&s;e the Epithet of <HI>Right Honourable.</HI></P>

And, whereas the law allows any one of the Commonalty ar|raigned for Trea&s;on or Felony to challenge 35 of his Jury without &s;hewing Cau&s;e, and others by &s;hewing Cau&s;e; a Peer of the Realm cannot challenge any of his Jury, or put any of them to their Oath, the Law pre&s;uming that they be|ing Peers of the Realm, and judging upon their Honour, cannot be guilty of Fal&s;hood, Favour, or Malice.</P>
<P>In Criminal Cau&s;es a Peer cannot be tried but by a Jury of the Peers of the Realm; who are not, as other Juries, to be put to their Oath, but their Verdict given in upon their Honour &s;uf|ficeth.</P>
<P>All Peers of the Realm being lookt upon as the King's con&s;tant Coun&s;ellors, their Per&s;ons are at all Times priviledged from Arre&s;ts, except in Criminal Ca&s;es. Therefore a Peer cannot be Outlawed in any Civil Action, and no Attach|ment lies again&s;t him. The only Way for &s;a|tisfaction from a Peer is by Execution taken forth upon his Lands and Goods, and not by Attachment, or Impri&s;onment of his Per|&s;on.</P>
<P>So tender is the Law of the Honour, Credit, Reputation, and Per&s;ons of Noblemen, that there is a Statute on purpo&s;e, called <HI>Scandalum Magnatum,</HI> to puni&s;h all &s;uch as by fal&s;e Reports <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ring any &s;candal upon them.</P>
<PB N="216" REF="310">
<P>They are exempted from all Attendance at Leets, or Sheriffs Turns, where others are ob|liged to take the Oath of Allegiance. And, whereas, for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing of Riots, the She|riff may rai&s;e the <HI>Po&s;&s;e Comitatus;</HI> yet he can|not command any Peer of the Realm to attend that Service.</P>
<P>In Civil Cau&s;es, they are not to be Impanelled upon any Jury or Inque&s;t <HI>de facto,</HI> though in a Matter between two Peers; and, if a Peer be returned upon any &s;uch Jury, there lies a &s;pecial Writ for his Di&s;charge.</P>
<P>They are, upon no Ca&s;e, to be bound to their good Behaviour, or put to &s;wear they will not break the Peace; but only to promi&s;e it upon their Honour, which was ever counted &s;o &s;acred as upon no terms to be violated.</P>
<P>Every Peer of the Realm &s;ummoned to Par|liament may con&s;titute, in his lawful ab&s;ence, a Proxy to Vote for him; which none of the Commons may do. And any Peer in a Place of Tru&s;t is free to make a Deputy, to act in his ab|&s;ence, whil&s;t he attends the Per&s;on of the King.</P>
<P>Where a Peer of the Realm is Defendant, no Day of Grace is to be granted to the Plaintiff; the Law pre&s;uming, that a Peer of the Realm mu&s;t always be ready to attend the Per&s;on of the King, and the Service of the Commonwealth Therefore he ought not to be delayed any lon|ger than the ordinary U&s;e of the Court, but t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> have expedition of Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>In any Civil Trial, where a Peer of the Real<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is Plaintiff or Defendant, there mu&s;t be at lea&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> one Knight returned of the Jury.

<PB N="217" REF="310">
<P>In all Ca&s;es wherein the Priviledge of the Clergy is allowed to other Men, and in divers Ca&s;es where that Priviledge is taken away from them, a Peer of the Realm, upon his Reque&s;t, &s;hall be for the fir&s;t time adjudged as a Clerk Convict, though he cannot read. And that without burning in the Hand, lo&s;s of In|heritance, or Corruption of Bloud.</P>
<P>In ca&s;e of Amerciaments of the Peers of the Realm upon Non-Suits, or other Judgments, a Duke is to be amerced but Ten Pounds, and all others under Five. This to be done by their Peers, according to <HI>Magna Charta;</HI> though it has been often done of late by the King's Ju|&s;tices.</P>
<P>A Peer of the Realm, being &s;ent for by the King to Court, Parliament, Council, or Chan|cery, has the Priviledge, pa&s;&s;ing by the King's Park or Fore&s;t, both coming and returning, to Kill one or two Deer. An Earl has 8 Tun of Wine Cu&s;tom-free, and the re&s;t proportiona|bly.</P>
<P>All Peers of the Realm have a Priviledge of Qualifying a certain Number of Chaplains, to hold Plurality of Benefices, with Cure of Souls. But it mu&s;t be with a Di&s;pen&s;ation fir&s;t obtain|ed from the Archbi&s;hop, and the &s;ame ratified under the Great Seal of England. Thus a Duke may qualify &s;ix Chaplains, a Marque&s;s and Earl five, a Vi&s;count four, and a Baron <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hree.</P>
<P>A Peer of the Realm has al&s;o the Priviledge <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f Retaining &s;ix Aliens, whereas another may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ot Retain above four.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the chief Priviledges belonging to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Nobility of England, which are great and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on&s;iderable. And yet none of them ever had
<PB N="218" REF="311">the Priviledge of the Grandees of Spain, to be covered in the King's Pre&s;ence, except <HI>Henry Ratcliff,</HI> Earl of Surrey. 'Tis true the Princes of the Bloud have often had the honour of be|ing covered, but then it was by the King's gra|cious Command, not by virtue of any con&s;tant Priviledge.</P>
<P>Neither are our Noblemen exempted, as in France, from <HI>Tailles</HI> and Contributions; but always bear a &s;hare proportionable. And, in ca&s;e of a Poll-Act, they are u&s;ually thus Rated, according to their &s;everal Degrees of Honour. Viz.

<P>The Nobles to bear up their Rank, have ge|nerally great and plentiful E&s;tates, &s;ome of them
<PB N="219" REF="311">beyond tho&s;e of &s;everal Princes beyond Sea. And, till the Civil Wars in the Reign of Charles I. they lived with &s;uitable &s;plendour and Magni&s;i|cence; Keeping a plentiful Table, and a nume|rous Attendance, with &s;everal Officers; de|lighting in noble Exerci&s;es, and appearing a|broad according to their Rank and Quality. Honour and Integrity, Ju&s;tice and Sobriety, Courage and Wi&s;dom, were Virtues they ex|celled in. A Lord's Hou&s;e was then lookt upon as a well di&s;ciplined Court, where Servants lived not only in Plenty, but in great Order, with the Opportunity of getting good Breeding, and the Pro&s;pect of rai&s;ing them&s;elves in the World by their Lords Bountifulne&s;s and innate Gene|ro&s;ity. How far the Ca&s;e is altered, 'tis but too plain. Yet it is hoped, a virtuous and ge|nerous Prince will bring back that Golden Age.</P>
<P>But there is an additional Honour, the mo&s;t ancient <HI>Order of the Garter,</HI> wherein &s;ome of the chief of our Nobility have ever had a &s;hare, &s;ince its fir&s;t In&s;titution. The Founder of this Order was that warlike and potent Prince, King Edward III, who &s;everal times triumphed over France and Scotland. <HI>Polydore Virgil</HI> gives it a &s;light O|riginal; but his Grounds by his own Confe&s;&s;ion, grew from the vulgar Opinion. Which is, that Edward III, having obtained many great Victo|ries (King John of France, and David Bruce of Scotland being both his Pri&s;oners, King Henry of Ca&s;tille the Ba&s;tard expul&s;ed, and Don Pedro re&s;tored by Edward the Black Prince) did upon no weighty Occa&s;ion fir&s;t erect this Order, An|no 1350. Who dancing with the Queen, and other Ladies of the Court, took up a <HI>Garter</HI> that hapned to fall from one of them. Whereat
<PB N="220" REF="312">&s;ome of the Lords &s;miling, the King &s;aid, that e're it were long he would make that <HI>Garter</HI> to be of high Reputation, and &s;hortly after in&s;titu|ted this Order. A very unlikely Thing, that &s;o noble an Order &s;hould be rai&s;ed on &s;o mean a Foundation.</P>
<P>Whereas, according to <HI>Cambden,</HI> and &s;everal others, the In&s;titution of this Order by the fore|&s;aid King Edward was upon his good &s;ucce&s;s in a Skirmi&s;h, wherein the King's <HI>Garter</HI> was u&s;ed for a Token. The Order fir&s;t In&s;tituted by the Name of the <HI>Order of S. George,</HI> the Patron of England, and of this Order in particular. And, becau&s;e the <HI>Garter</HI> was the only part of the whole Habit of the Order, made choice of at fir&s;t to be con&s;tantly worn, it came in pro|ce&s;s of Time to be called the <HI>Order of the Gar|ter.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ame con&s;i&s;ts of a <HI>Sovereign</HI> (which is always the King of England) and 25 <HI>Companions,</HI> called <HI>Knights of the Garter;</HI> &s;ome of them Prin|ces of other Countries, and the re&s;t Noblemen of this Kingdom. And 'tis ob&s;erved, that there have been of this Order, &s;ince the In&s;titution, no le&s;s than 8 Emperours, and 27 or 28 forein Kings, be&s;ides many Sovereign Princes of a lower Rank.</P>
<P>The <HI>Garter,</HI> to be daily worn upon the left Leg by the Companions of this Order, is a blue <HI>Garter</HI> deckt with Gold, Pearl, and precious Stones, and a Buckle of gold. They are not to be &s;een abroad without it, upon pain of paying two Crowns to any Officer of the Or|der who &s;hall fir&s;t claim it. Only upon a Journey a blue Ribbon may &s;erve in&s;tead of it.</P>
<PB N="221" REF="312">
<P>The Meaning of the <HI>Garter</HI> is, to put the Companions of the Order in mind, that, as by this Order they were joyned in a firm League of Amity and Concord, &s;o by their <HI>Garter,</HI> as by a fa&s;t Tie of Affection, they are obliged to love one another. Now, to prevent an ill Con|&s;truction of it, King Edward commanded the&s;e French Words to be fixt upon it, <HI>Honi &s;oit qui mal y pen&s;e,</HI> that is, Shame be to him that thinks evil of it. And it was done in France, becau&s;e England being then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a great Part of France, the French Tongue was the u|&s;ual Language in the King of England's Court.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the <HI>Garter,</HI> the honourable Compa|nions are to wear at In&s;tallations and high Fea&s;ts, a <HI>Surcoat,</HI> a <HI>Mantle,</HI> a high black <HI>Velvet Cap,</HI> a <HI>Collar</HI> of pure gold, with other &s;tately and mag|nificent Apparel. The <HI>Collar</HI> compo&s;ed of Ro&s;es enamelled Red, within a Garter enamelled Blue, with the u&s;ual Motto in Letters of gold, and be|tween each of the&s;e Garters a Knot with Ta&s;&s;els of gold.</P>
<P>By an Order made April 1626, they are to wear on the left &s;ide of their Upper Garment (whether Cloak or Coat) an <HI>E&s;cutcheon of the Arms of S. George,</HI> that is, the Cro&s;s of England incirled with the Garter and Motto, from whence round about are ca&s;t Beams of Silver, like the Rays of the Sun in full lu&s;tre, which is com|monly called the <HI>Star.</HI></P>
<P>To this Order belongs a <HI>Colledge,</HI> &s;eated in the Ca&s;tle of Wind&s;or, with <HI>S. George's Chappel</HI> there erected by King Edward, and the <HI>Chapter|hou&s;e.</HI> The <HI>Colledge,</HI> being a Corporation, has a great Seal, and &s;everal Officers belonging to it.</P>
<PB N="222" REF="313">
<P>The principal of the&s;e is the <HI>Prelate of the Garter,</HI> which Office is &s;ettled on the Bi&s;hop|rick of Winche&s;ter. Next, the <HI>Chanceliour of the Garter,</HI> the Bi&s;hop of Salisbury for the time being. A <HI>Regi&s;ter,</HI> the Dean of Wind&s;or. <HI>Gar|ter,</HI> the principal King at Arms, who manages and mar&s;hals their Solemnities at their In&s;talla|tions and Fea&s;ts. And la&s;tly, the <HI>U&s;her of the Garter,</HI> who is al&s;o the U&s;her of the Black-Rod.</P>
<P>To the <HI>Chappel</HI> there belongs 14 <HI>Secular Ca|nons,</HI> and 13 Vicars, all Prie&s;ts. Be&s;ides 26 <HI>poor Knights,</HI> maintained by this Colledge, for their Prayers to the Honour of God, and S. George.</P>
<P>The Solemnity of this Order is performed yearly on S. <HI>George's Day,</HI> the 23th of April. As for the Orders and Con&s;titutions belonging to this Society, touching the Solemnities in making the&s;e Knights, their Duties after Creation, and their high Priviledges, they are too long to be in&s;erted here.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the Gentry of England.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>NExt to the Nobility, which is lookt upon as the Flower of the Kingdom, let us take a View of the Engli&s;h <HI>Gentry,</HI> cal|led by &s;ome the le&s;&s;er (or lower) Nobility, and Keeping a middle Rank betwixt the Nobles and the Common People. Of the&s;e there are three Degrees; <HI>Knights, E&s;quires,</HI> and <HI>Gentle|men.</HI></P>
<P>We have now but three &s;orts of Knights in England, be&s;ides the Knights of the Garter. Viz. <HI>Baronets, Knights of the Bath,</HI> and <HI>Knights Bat|chelours.</HI></P>
<P>The Degree of <HI>Baronets</HI> is the next to Ba|rons, and the only Degree of Knighthood that is Hereditary. An Honour fir&s;t In&s;tituted by King James I, Anno 1611, conferred by a Patent upon a Man, and his Heirs Males of his Body lawfully begotten. The Purcha&s;e of it does commonly ari&s;e, Fees and all, to 1200 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> the Purcha&s;er being to pay, be&s;ides the Fees, as much Mony as will pay for 3 Years 30 Foot-Souldiers at 8 pence a Day, to &s;erve in the Pro|vince of Ul&s;ter in Ireland. Therefore they have the Priviledge to bear in a Canton of their Coat of Arms, or in a whole Scutcheon, the Arms of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l&s;ter,</HI> viz. in a Field <HI>Argent</HI> a Hand <HI>Gules.</HI> In the King's Armies, they have place in the
<PB N="224" REF="314">gro&s;s near the King's Standard. And for their Funerals they have al&s;o particular Privi|ledges.</P>
<P>The whole Number of them, by the fir&s;t In|&s;titution; is not to exceed 200 at one and the &s;ame time. After which Number compleated, as any one for want of Heirs come to be ex|tinct, the Number is not to be made up by new Creations, but be &s;uffered to dimini&s;h, as appears by their Patent. And yet the very Founder, King James I, tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t his Rule, by creating 203. Charles, his next Succe&s;&s;or, made 455. But King Charles II, outdid them both, by creating near upon 900 during his Reign. At this time there are reckoned above 700 li|ving.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Nicholas Bacon</HI> of Suffolk was the fir&s;t <HI>Ba|ronet</HI> created, who&s;e Succe&s;&s;or is therefore &s;tiled <HI>Primus Baronettorum Angliae.</HI></P>
<P>No Honour is ever to be created between Ba|rons and Baronets.</P>
<P>As for the other two Degrees of <HI>Knighthood,</HI> they are but Per&s;onal, and not Hereditary; &s;o that the Honour dies with the Per&s;on Knighted, and de&s;cends not to his Son.</P>
<P><HI>Knights of the Bath</HI> are &s;o called, from their Bathing the Night before the Creation within the Li&s;ts of the Bath. The fir&s;t of this &s;ort were made by Henry IV; but now they are u&s;ually made at the Coronation of a King or Queen, or Creation of a Prince of Wales.</P>
<P>They wear a Scarlet Ribbon Belt-wi&s;e; and take place of Knights Batchelours, but come af|ter Baronets. There are but a few Knights of this Order.</P>
<P><HI>Knights Batchelours</HI> are the lowe&s;t &s;ort of Knights, and the mo&s;t common. Anciently this Degree was in greater e&s;teem than it is at the
<PB N="225" REF="314">pre&s;ent, when it was only conferred upon Sword|men for their military Service, who from the Gilt Spurs u&s;ually put upon them were called in Latine <HI>Equites Aurati.</HI> Whereas now a days this Honour is al&s;o be&s;towed upon Gown-men, viz. Lawyers and Phy&s;icians. And all the Ce|remony u&s;ed in their Creation is their Kneeling down before the King, and His Maje&s;ties lightly touching them on the &s;houlder with a naked Sword.</P>
<P>Anciently there was another Sort of Knights now di&s;u&s;ed, I mean the <HI>Knights Bannerets,</HI> who were Knighted in the Field. This Order was accounted very honourable, had the precedency of the Knights of the Bath, and bore their Arms with Supporters, which was not allowed to any under this Degree.</P>
<P>Next to Knights are the <HI>E&s;quires,</HI> &s;o called from the French <HI>E&s;cuyer,</HI> this from the Latine <HI>Scutiger;</HI> which Name was given of old to him that attended a Knight in time of War, and carried his Shield. Whereas E&s;quire with us is a meer Title of Dignity next to and below a Knight, and &s;ignifies a Gentleman, or one that beareth Arms as a Te&s;timony of his Nobility and Gentry.</P>
<P>They who by right claim this Title now are all the younger Sons of Noblemen; and, by the Common Law of England, their very elde&s;t Sons are E&s;quires, and no more. Next are the E&s;quires of the King's Body, the elde&s;t Sons of Noblemens younger Sons, Knights elde&s;t Sons, and their elder Sons for ever. Next, E&s;quires created by the King, by putting about their Necks a Collar of S's, and be&s;towing on them a pair of Silver Spurs.</P>
<PB N="226" REF="315">
<P>Tho&s;e that are reputed, or lookt upon as e|qual to E&s;quires, tho none of them be really &s;o, are &s;everal Magi&s;trates, and Officers in the King's Court; as Judges, Sergeants at Law, Sheriffs, Mayors, Ju&s;tices of the Peace, Coun|&s;ellors at Law, and the principal Commanders of an Army. So Heads of Hou&s;es in the Uni|ver&s;ities, Doctors of Law, Phy&s;ick, and Mu&s;ick, u&s;ually take place next to Knights, and before ordinary Gentlemen.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, <HI>Gentlemen</HI> are properly &s;uch as are de|&s;cended of a good Family, bearing a Coat of Arms, without any particular Title. And the&s;e we call Gentlemen born.</P>
<P>But U&s;e has &s;o far &s;tretched the &s;ignification of this Word, both high and low, that every Nobleman, nay the King him&s;elf, may be cal|led a Gentleman. And, on the other &s;ide, any one that, without a Coat of Arms, has either a liberal, or genteel Education, that looks Gentle|man-like (whether he be &s;o, or not) and has wherewithall to live freely and hand&s;omely, is by the Courte&s;y of England u&s;ually called a Gentleman. Others, by their Offices, are lookt upon as &s;uch; particularly mo&s;t of the King's Menial Servants, and the principal Officers in Noble-mens Families, &amp;c. The Military Profe&s;&s;ion, which has been always counted Noble, &s;eems to give the very meane&s;t Profe&s;&s;ors of it a Title to this Quality. But it is more particularly adapted to two di&s;tinct Bodies of the King's Guards; the one called <HI>Gentlemen Pen&s;ioners,</HI> who gard his Per|&s;on within Doors; and the other the <HI>Gentlem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n of the Guard,</HI> by whom is meant his Body of Hor&s;e Guards, who gard the Kings Per&s;on on hor&s;eback without Doors.</P>
<PB N="227" REF="315">
<P>As in Germany all Noblemens, &s;o in England all Gentlemens Arms de&s;cend to all the Sons a|like. Only the elde&s;t Son bears Arms without difference, which the younger may not.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides above 700 Knights Baronets, and the few Knights of the Bath, there are reckoned to this day above 1400 ordinary Knights, and 6000 E&s;quires and Gentlemen; who&s;e younger Bro|thers in all may make up at lea&s;t 12000 all over England. And the Land in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them all has been computed to amount at lea&s;t to four Millions yearly.</P>
<P>The Law of England, which is &s;o Favourable to the Nobility, has not a proportionable Regard for the Gentry. For, whether they be Knights, E&s;quires, or Gentlemen, they are all reckoned by law, even Noblemens Sons, among&s;t the Com|mons of England. So that the elde&s;t Son of a Duke, though by the Courte&s;y of England &s;tiled an Earl, &s;hall be Arraigned (if charged with a Crime) by the Title of E&s;quire only, and tried by a Jury of Common Free-holders. In Parlia|ment he can &s;it only in the Hou&s;e of Commons, if elected, unle&s;s he be called by the King's Writ to the Hou&s;e of Lords.</P>
<P><HI>Knights</HI> are di&s;tingui&s;hed in England by the Title of <HI>Sir</HI> prefixt to their Chri&s;ten names. And Gentlemen have no other Title but that of <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> when &s;poken of; and that of <HI>Sir,</HI> when &s;poken to. But, if one writes to an E&s;quire, the Direction ought to be thus, as <HI>To Thomas Whit|field E&s;quire.</HI></P>
<P>The Epithet of <HI>Honourable</HI> is u&s;ually given to any Knight, E&s;quire, or Gentleman, di&s;tingui&s;h|ed by &s;ome eminent and per&s;onal Worth.</P>

<P>BY the Commonalty I mean Yeomen, Mer|chants, Artificers, Trade&s;men, Mariners, and all others getting their Livelyhood after a Mechanick Way.</P>
<P><HI>Yeomen</HI> are &s;uch among&s;t the Commonalty who having Land of their own to a good value, Keep it in their own hands, husband it them|&s;elves, and live with their Families upon it. They are therefore by the Law called <HI>Freeholders,</HI> be|cau&s;e they hold Lands or Tenements Inheritable by a perpetual Right to them and their Heirs for ever. Their Number is great in England, and many of them have E&s;tates fit for Gentlemen. Forty or Fifty pounds a Year is ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ordinary, 100 or 200 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a Year in &s;ome Counties is not rare, in Kent there are tho&s;e who have 1000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> and &s;ome more <HI>per Annum.</HI> Which is not ea&s;y to be found among&s;t Men of this Rank any where el&s;e in Europe.</P>
<P>And, whereas Husbandry is commonly lookt upon as the mo&s;t innocent Life, and the free&s;t from the Corruption and Cheats that attend o|ther Profe&s;&s;ions, therefore the Law of England has a better Opinion of the Yeomanry that oc|cupy Lands, than of Trade&s;men or Artificers. And accordingly Yeomen are capable of bearing
<PB N="229" REF="316">&s;ome Offices, as of Con&s;table, and Church-War|den, to &s;erve upon Juries, to be Train-Soul|diers, to vote in the Election of Knights of the Shire to &s;erve in Parliament, &amp;c. And, by the Statutes of England, certain Immunities are gi|ven to Freeholders and Land-men, tho they are not Gentlemen.</P>
<P>Next to Freeholders are the <HI>Copy-holders,</HI> who are much of the &s;ame nature. I mean tho&s;e <HI>Copy|holders,</HI> that hold Copy-holds certain. Which is a kind of Inheritance, in many Places called <HI>Cu&s;tomary;</HI> becau&s;e the Tenant dying, and the Hold being void, the next of Bloud, paying the Cu&s;tomary Fine (as two Shillings for an A|cre, or &s;uch like) may not be denied his Admi&s;|&s;ion. They are called <HI>Copy-holders,</HI> from the Copy of Court-Roll of the Mannor within which they hold their Land, by which Copy only they hold it. For this is all a <HI>Copy-holder</HI> has to &s;hew for his Title, which he takes from the Steward of the Lord of the Mannor's Court.</P>
<P>But, as England is one of the mo&s;t trading Countries in Europe, &s;o the greate&s;t Body of its Commonalty is that of <HI>Traders,</HI> or Men that live by Buying and Selling.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t eminent whereof are tho&s;e we call <HI>Merchants,</HI> who trade only by Whole-&s;ale. The&s;e are the Men who, by their Stock and Indu&s;try, have found the Way, not only to Inrich them|&s;elves, but to make the whole Nation thrive and flouri&s;h by a perpetual Circulation of Trade, by exporting home-bred and importing forein Commodities, by incouraging thereby Naviga|tion, and by procuring comfortable Imployment to a va&s;t Number of Artificers, Trade&s;men, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">etailers.</P>
<PB N="230" REF="317">
<P>In &s;hort, &s;uch is the benign Influence of Trade and Commerce by their means all over the Nation, that there is &s;carce any part of it but feels the Benefit thereof. And for this great Advantage to the Publick, as well as their pri|vate Wealth, they have got a proportionable e&s;teem and re&s;pect from the re&s;t of the Nation. In&s;omuch that, whereas Trading formerly ren|dred a Gentleman ignoble, now an ignoble Per&s;on makes him&s;elf by Merchandizing as good as a Gentleman; and many Gentlemen Born (&s;ome of them Younger Sons of Noble|men) take upon them this Profe&s;&s;ion, without any prejudice or blemi&s;h to their Birth. Nay, the Law of England, that ever had but a &s;light Opinion of Traders, is &s;o far Obliterated in this Point by Cu&s;tom and Intere&s;t, that, whereas by Law a Ward come to Age may bring his Action of Di&s;paragement again&s;t his Gardian for offering any &s;uch in Marriage, now 'tis common for Gentlemens and Merchants Sons and Daugh|ters to Intermarry.</P>
<P>The truth is, Gentility with competent Means is an excellent Compound; but with|out it, 'tis but a wretched Condition, as the World goes now. And who would not rather be a &s;ub&s;tantial hone&s;t Trader, &s;o as to &s;tand upon his own Legs, and make &s;ome figure in the World, than for want of Imployment to &s;tarve with a point of Honour, or live a bor|rowed Life; in this Age e&s;pecially, where Po|verty is &s;o little pitied, and grown &s;o contemp|tible?</P>
<P>Poverty (&s;ays an Author) the general Scare|crow of Mankind, the fear of which keeps Men in perpetual Morion, and makes them run head|long into the greate&s;t Dangers.</P>
<PB N="231" REF="317">
<Q>Per Mare Pauperiem fugiunt, per Saxa, per Ignes.</Q>
<P>Poverty, a lingering kind of Death, that, having once &s;eized upon ones Spirits, dejects and &s;tupifies him, takes away the edge of his Sen&s;es, weakens his Memory, di&s;compo&s;es his Mind, and makes him almo&s;t uncapable of any Thing. Poverty, in a Word, that turns Men into ridicule, as <HI>Juvenal</HI> has it in the&s;e Words,
<Q><L>&mdash;Nil habet Paupertas durius in &s;e,</L>
<L>Quam quod Ridiculos homines facit&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>In France indeed, where if a Gentleman born betakes him&s;elf to Trade forfeits his Gentility, the Gentry &s;tand &s;o much upon their Honour, that it is very rare to &s;ee a French Gentleman turn to Merchandizing. But there they have greater Opportunities for preferring them&s;elves according to their quality, e&s;pecially by the Way of Arms. And &s;o jealous is the whole Body of them of this their Gentility, that rather than have it expo&s;ed in any of their Members by naked and hungry Poverty, their Way is to help one another to the utmo&s;t of their Power, and (which is very commendable) they &s;eldom fail to give a Gentleman, though never &s;o needy, the Re&s;pect due to his Birth. But it is &s;omething &s;urprizing, they &s;hould &s;o much decline Mer|chandizing, their King <HI>Lewis le Grand,</HI> not to mention his other Commodities, being the greate&s;t Salt-Merchant in the Known World,</P>
<PB N="232" REF="318">
<P>But, to return to our <HI>Commonalty,</HI> it may be &s;aid to comprehend three Parts in four of the Nation, the Generality of them Imployed in Husbandry, Trade, and Navigation, &s;ome in a higher, others in a le&s;&s;er Degree. And &s;uch is the Happine&s;s of this People in general, that none injoy greater Priviledges, or are more &s;ecure by Law from Oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>They are &s;ubject to no Taxes or Laws, but what they contrive them&s;elves by their Repre|&s;entatives in Parliament. And, in point of Trials, none of them can be Tried but by a Jury of his Peers, that is, by Twelve Men Com|moners like him&s;elf. Nor can he be Condemned but by the Laws of the Land.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the Government is &s;o very favoura|ble to the Common People of England, that unle&s;s the Laws be invaded, (which are the Bulwark of the Government) they need not fear to be any Way oppre&s;&s;ed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXII. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the Clergy of England, and fir&s;t of the Bi&s;hops.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Clergy of England is, like the Laity, divided into &s;everal Ranks, or Degrees. For as the Laity con&s;i&s;ts of Nobility, Gentry, and Commonalty; &s;o the Clergy is divided into Bi&s;hops, Dignitaries, and Inferious Clergy.</P>
<PB N="233" REF="318">
<P>The <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> are tho&s;e who take upon them the Government of the Church of England, ac|cording to Law, every one in his Dioce&s;e. And, as England con&s;i&s;ts of 26 Dioce&s;es, or Bi&s;hopricks, &s;o there are accordingly 26 Bi&s;hops, or Dioce&s;ans. Be&s;ides the Bi&s;hoprick of the I&s;le of Man, which is a di&s;tinct Bi&s;hoprick.</P>
<P>Their Office being <HI>Pa&s;toral,</HI> their Bu&s;ine&s;s is to feed their Flocks with the whol&s;om Doctrine of the Church, and &s;o to over&s;ee the Inferiour Clergy that by their Lives and Doctrine the People may Keep the Truth, and live according to the Rules of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>And, as each of them has a Canonical Au|thority over all the Prie&s;ts of his Dioce&s;e, &s;o they have all in chief the <HI>Power of Ordination;</HI> Which however is never performed but by the Bi&s;hop joyntly with &s;ome other Prie&s;ts.</P>
<P>They are al&s;o Impowred to grant In&s;titutions to Benefices upon Pre&s;entations of other Patrons, to command Induction to be given, to order the collecting and pre&s;erving of the Profits of va|cant Benefices for the Succe&s;&s;ors U&s;e.</P>
<P>They are bound to defend the Church-Liber|ties, and once in three Years to Vi&s;it each his Dioce&s;e. In this triennial Vi&s;itation they Inquire of the Manners, Carriages, and Offences of Mi|ni&s;ters, Church-Wardens, and the re&s;t of the Pari&s;hioners, principally of Offenders again&s;t Ju&s;tice, Piety, and Sobriety. Wardens of Ho&s;|pitals, Phy&s;icians, Chirurgeons, Schoolma&s;ters, and Midwives fall particularly under the Care of their Vi&s;itation.</P>
<P>Of the fore&s;aid 26 Bi&s;hops, there are two called <HI>Archbi&s;hops,</HI> the one of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and the other of <HI>York.</HI> The&s;e have a Superintenden|cy over all the Church of England, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure over the other Bi&s;hops.</P>
<PB N="234" REF="319">
<P>They have each of them his <HI>Province,</HI> or Ju|ri&s;diction; but that of <HI>Canterbury</HI> is much the greater of the two. For, of 26 Dioce&s;es, it takes up 22. Whereof 18 in England, viz. <HI>Canterbury, Lon|don, Winche&s;ter, Lincoln, Exeter, Hereford, Salisbury, Coventry</HI> and <HI>Lichfield, Bath</HI> and <HI>Wells, Oxford, Chiche&s;ter, Ely, Norwich, Carli&s;le, Worce&s;ter, Glo|c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ter, Bri&s;tol, Peterborough;</HI> and four in <HI>Wales,</HI> viz. <HI>S. A&s;aph, Landaff, Bangor,</HI> and <HI>S. Davids.</HI> Whereas the Province of <HI>York</HI> has but four Dio|ce&s;&s;es, <HI>York, Durham, Che&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>Carli&s;le;</HI> be|&s;ides that of the <HI>I&s;le of Man.</HI></P>
<P>Each of the&s;e Archbi&s;hops is called <HI>Primate</HI> of England, and <HI>Metropolitan</HI> of his Province. Yet the fir&s;t has &s;ome kind of Supereminency over the other, and has Power to Summon him to a National Synod.</P>
<P>Next to the two Archbi&s;hops are the Bi&s;hops of <HI>London, Durham,</HI> and <HI>Winche&s;ter;</HI> the Order of the re&s;t being by no other Rule than the Priority of their Con&s;ecration.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bi&s;hop of London</HI> has the Precedency of all the other Bi&s;hops, not only as being Bi&s;hop over the Metropolis of England, but as Provincial Dean of Canterbury. And, upon the Vacancy of the Archiepi&s;copal See, the Bi&s;hop of London has been u&s;ually tran&s;lated to that See; except|ing the Ca&s;e of Dr. <HI>William Sandcroft,</HI> the pre|&s;ent Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, who from Dean of Paul's was preferred to this Dignity by King <HI>Charles</HI> II.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bi&s;hop of Durham</HI> has been a Count Pa|latine &s;ix or &s;even hundred Years. The common Seal of his Bi&s;hoprick has been of a long time an <HI>Armed Knight,</HI> holding in one hand a <HI>Naked Sword,</HI> and in the other a <HI>Church.</HI> He has al&s;o at this day the Earldom of <HI>Sadberg,</HI> annexed long ago to this Bi&s;hoprick.</P>
<PB N="235" REF="319">
<P>The Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter was anciently re|puted Earl of <HI>Southampton,</HI> and &s;o &s;tiled by Hen|ry VIII, in the Statutes of the Honourable Or|der of the Garter. But that Earldom was &s;oon after di&s;po&s;ed of.</P>
<P>The Manner of making a Bi&s;hop in England is &s;o &s;olemn, that it is not to be pretermitted. When a Bi&s;hops See becomes vacant, fir&s;t the Dean and Chapter of the Cathedral give notice of it to the King, as the Patron of all the Bi&s;hop|ricks in England; and humbly reque&s;t his Ma|je&s;ty, that He will give them Leave to chu&s;e a|nother. Whereupon the King grants them his <HI>Conge d'e&s;lire,</HI> that is, Leave to elect; and withal does u&s;ually recommend unto them whom His Maje&s;ty thinks fit. Then the Dean &s;ummons a Chapter, that is, the Prebendaries of the Cathe|dral; who either elect the Per&s;on recommended by the Kings Letters, or &s;hew Cau&s;e to the con|trary. The Election being over, it is certified to the Party elected. Who does mode&s;tly refu&s;e it the fir&s;t and &s;econd time; if a third time, the &s;ame is certified to the King, who recommends another. When the Election is accepted, it is cer|tified to the King, and the Archbi&s;hop of that Province. The King thereupon gives his Royal A&s;&s;ent under the Great Seal of England, which is exhibited to the Archbi&s;hop of that Province, with Command to confirm and con&s;ecrate him. Then the Archbi&s;hop &s;ub&s;cribes <HI>Fiat Confirmatio,</HI> and gives. Commi&s;&s;ion under his Epi&s;copal Seal to his Vicar General, to perform all the Acts thereunto required.</P>
<P>Then a Citation comes forth from the &s;aid Vi|car General in the Name of the Archbi&s;hop, &s;ummoning all the People that have any Thing to object again&s;t the Party elected to appear at a
<PB N="236" REF="320">certain Time and Place, to make their Objecti|ons. Which is done fir&s;t by Proclamation three &s;everal times, at Bow-Church; and then the Citation is affixt on the Church door for all people to read. At the Day and Place a&s;&s;igned for the Oppo&s;ers Appearance, the Vicar General &s;it|ting as Judge, the Proctor for the Dean and Chapter exhibits the Royal A&s;&s;ent, and the Com|mi&s;&s;ion of the Archbi&s;hop. Which being read and accepted by the Vicar General, the Proctor exhibits the Proxy from the Dean and Chapter, pre&s;ents the Bi&s;hop elect, returns the Citation, and de&s;ires the Oppo&s;ers to be called in three times. This being done accordingly, and none appearing, they are pronounced Contumacious; and a Decree made to proceed to Sentence, in the behalf of the Bi&s;hop elect. Who thereupon takes the Oaths of Supremacy, Simony, and Ca|nonical Obedience; and then the Judge of the Arches reads and &s;ub&s;cribes the Sentence. After which there is u&s;ually an Entertainment made for the Officers and other there pre&s;ent. And the Bi&s;hop elect, being thus Confirmed, may act as Bi&s;hop, even before he is Con&s;ecrated.</P>
<P>Some time after this follows the Con&s;ecration. For the Bi&s;hops are a di&s;tinct Order of them|&s;elves, there being three Orders in the Church of England, Bi&s;hops, Prie&s;ts, and Deacons. And, as none may be admitted a Deacon (without a Di&s;pen&s;ation) under the Age of 23 Years, nor a Prie&s;t under 24; &s;o none can be made a Bi&s;hop, till he be full 30 Years of age. And, whereas Prie&s;ts and Deacons, when they take their re|&s;pective Orders, are &s;aid to be Ordained; a Bi|&s;hop, when he takes the Epi&s;copal Order, is &s;aid to be Con&s;ecrated.</P>
<P>The Con&s;ecration is performed by the Arch|bi&s;hop of the Province, or &s;ome other Bi&s;hop
<PB N="237" REF="320">Commi&s;&s;ioned by him, with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of two other Bi&s;hops, either in the Chappel of the Archbi&s;hop, or of any other Bi&s;hop. And it is done either upon a Sunday or Holy-day, after Morning-Service. Then the Archbi&s;hop (or his Deputy) begins the Communion-Service. And, after a certain Prayer appointed for this Occa|&s;ion, one of the Bi&s;hops pre&s;ent reads the Epi&s;tle 1 Tim. 3, another the Go&s;pel John 21. Which is followed by the Nicene Creed, and next to that a Sermon. After Sermon, the Bi&s;hop elect, being ve&s;ted with his Rochet or Linnen-Gar|ment, is by two Bi&s;hops pre&s;ented to the Arch|bi&s;hop, or his Deputy, &s;itting in his Chair; who demands the King's Mandate for the Con&s;ecra|tion, and cau&s;es it to be read. That done, the Bi&s;hop elect takes the Oath of Supremacy, and of Canonical Obedience to the Archbi&s;hop. After which, they fall to Prayers. Then the Bi&s;hop elect does An&s;wer &s;everal Interrogatories that are put to him; and, after his An&s;wers, the re&s;t of the Epi&s;copal Habit is put upon him. This done, they Kneel down to Prayers again. Which being ended, the Bi&s;hop elect being upon his Knees, the Archbi&s;hop and Bi&s;hops there pre&s;ent lay their Hands on his Head, and by a pious grave Form of Words they Con&s;ecrate him. After|wards the Archbi&s;hop delivers a Bible to the Bi&s;hop elect, with another &s;et Form of Words. Then they all proceed to the Communion; and having received the Sacrament, they depart with the Ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>Then the new Bi&s;hop treats at a &s;pelendid Din|ner, the chief of the Nobility, Clergy, Judges, Privy Coun&s;ellours, &amp;c. Which Dinner (with the Fees of Con&s;ecration) does u&s;ually amount to five or &s;ix hundred Pounds.</P>

<P>The&s;e Suffragan Bi&s;hops had the Name, Title, and Dignity of Bi&s;hop, and (as other Bi&s;hops) were Con&s;ecrated by the Archbi&s;hop of the Pro|vince. They executed each of them &s;uch Power, Juri&s;diction, and Authority, and received &s;uch Profits as were limited in their Commi&s;&s;ions by the Bi&s;hops (or Dioce&s;ans) who&s;e Suffragans they were. In the&s;e Bi&s;hops ab&s;ence, when they were either re&s;iding at Court to advi&s;e the King, or imployed upon Emba&s;&s;ies abroad, the Suffragans u&s;ually &s;upply'd their Places. Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> in publick A&s;&s;emblies, took place next after the Temporal Peers of the Realm. But &s;ince the Dioce&s;an Bi&s;hops grew le&s;s Courtiers, and more Re&s;identiary, the Suffragan Bi&s;hops began to be laid a&s;ide, &s;o that there have been none for ma|ny Years in the Church of England.</P>
<PB N="241" REF="322">
<P>I come now to the Prerogatives, Priviledges, Bower, Revenues, and great Deeds of Bi|&s;hops.</P>
<P>All the Bi&s;hops of England are Barons and Peers of the Realm, and &s;it as &s;uch in the Hou&s;e of Lords. They are the Spiritual Lords, lookt upon as the Fathers (or Gardians) of the Church, and therefore commonly &s;tiled <HI>Right Reverend Fathers in God.</HI> And, as 'tis u&s;ual in England for well-bred Children to ask their Pa|rents Ble&s;&s;ing Morning and Evening, with one Knee upon the Ground; &s;o the true Sons of the Church, looking upon the Bi&s;hops as their Spiri|tual Fathers, commonly begin their Addre&s;&s;es to them by asking their Ble&s;&s;ing in the &s;ame re&s;pectful manner.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the Priviledges injoy'd by Bi&s;hops, as Peers, and therefore common with tho&s;e of the Temporal Lords, they have &s;ome peculiar Pre|rogatives, and tho&s;e of a high nature. 'Tis unde|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iable, that all Juri&s;diction in England is in&s;epa|rably annexed to the Crown. And yet the Bi|&s;hops Courts, tho held by the King's Authority, are not counted to be properly the King's Courts. Therefore the Bi&s;hops &s;end forth Writs in their own Names, <HI>Te&s;te</HI> the Bi&s;hop, and not in the King's Name, as all the King's Courts properly &s;o called do.</P>
<P>And, whereas in other Courts there are &s;eve|ral Judges to each, a Bi&s;hop in his Court judges, and pa&s;&s;es Sentence alone by him&s;elf.</P>
<P>A Bi&s;hop be&s;ides has this tran&s;cendent Privi|ledge, that he may (as the King does) depute his Authority to another, as to a Bi&s;hop Suffra|gan, his Chancellour, or Commi&s;&s;ary. Which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">one of the King's Judges can do.</P>
<PB N="242" REF="323">
<P>Bi&s;hops, in what&s;oever Chri&s;tian State they come, their Epi&s;copal Dignity and Degree is acknow|ledged; and may, as Bi&s;hops, confer Orders, &amp;c. Whereas no Temporal Lord is in Law acknow|ledged &s;uch out of the Prince's Dominions who conferred his Honour.</P>
<P>The Law of England attributes &s;o much to the Word of a Bi&s;hop, that, not only in the Trial of Ba&s;tardy, the Bi&s;hops Certificate &s;hall &s;uffice, but al&s;o in Trial of Here&s;y, which toucheth a Mans Life.</P>
<P>If a Clergy-man Kills his Bi&s;hops or Ordinary, the Law looks upon it as a Parricide; and 'tis Petty-Trea&s;on, by Law.</P>
<P>Every Bi&s;hop may by Statute Law qualify &s;ix Chaplains, which is as many as a Duke.</P>
<P>But, if the Bi&s;hops Priviledges be &s;o great, the <HI>Archbi&s;hops</HI> are much greater, e&s;pecially his Grace of Canterbury's. Who is the fir&s;t Peer of the Realm, and next to the Royal Family precedes not only all Dukes, but all the great Officers of the Crown.</P>
<P>Though he holds his Place from the King, yet in the King's Writs to him he is &s;tiled <HI>Dei Gratia Archiepi&s;copo Cantuarien&s;i;</HI> and, whereas other Bi&s;hops write <HI>Divina Permi&s;&s;ione,</HI> he writes him|&s;elf <HI>Divina Providentia.</HI> When he is Inve&s;ted in the Archbi&s;hoprick, he is &s;aid to be Inthro|ned.</P>
<P>It belongs properly to him to Crown the King; and he had formerly the Power of appointing the Lent Preachers, which is now in the Lord High Chamberlain.</P>

<P>He has the Prerogative, with two other Bi&s;hops, to Con&s;ecrate a new made Bi&s;hop; to appoint Coadjutors to infirm Bi&s;hops; to confirm the E|lection of Bi&s;hops within his Province; to call Provincial Synods according to the King's Writ directed to him; to be Moderator in the Synods or Convocations, and there to give his Suffrage la&s;t of all.

<P>And yet I mu&s;t &s;ay this to the eternal Prai&s;e of the Epi&s;copal Order, that they have done <HI>great Things</HI> for the Publick out of their Reve|nues. For mo&s;t of the great <HI>publick Works</HI> now

<P>In former Reigns, when the Clergy were judged to be the fitte&s;t Per&s;ons to execute mo&s;t of the chief Offices and Places of the Realm, &s;uch Benefits and Advantages accrued thereby to this Kingdom, that there are few Things of any great Con&s;equence to the Welfare thereof but the Bi&s;hops and Prelates were the chief Actors therein. The excellent <HI>Laws</HI> (&s;ays an Author) made by &s;everal of the Saxon Kings, from whom we have our Common Laws, and our Priviledges mentioned in <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> were all made by the Per&s;ua&s;ions and Advice of Bi&s;hops, named in our Hi&s;tories.

The <HI>Union</HI> of the two Hou&s;es of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> (whereby a long and cruel Civil War was ended) was by the Ad|vice and Coun&s;el of Bi&s;hop Morton, then a Pri|vy Coun&s;ellour.

<P>But, above all, the Converting England to Chri&s;tianity, the Reforming of it when corrup|ted, and the Defence of the Reformation again&s;t all Romi&s;h Writers, is principally (if not &s;ole|ly) owing to Bi&s;hops and Prelates.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIII. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the Dignify'd Clergy.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS among&s;t the Laity the Gentry Keeps a middle Rank betwixt the Nobility and the Commonalty, &s;o among&s;t the Cler|gy of England there is a middle Station between the Epi&s;copal Order and the inferiour Clergy. Which Station is properly that of the <HI>Dignify'd Clergy,</HI> as <HI>Deans, Arch-Deacons,</HI> and <HI>Prebenda|ries,</HI> the Subject of this Chapter.</P>
<P>For a Supply of able and fit Per&s;ons to make Bi&s;hops, or to a&s;&s;i&s;t Bi&s;hops, a certain Number of eminent Divines both for their Piety and Learning were thought fit by our Fore-fathers to be placed in a Collegiate manner at every Cathedral, or Epi&s;copal See; out of which Se|minaries fit Per&s;ons from time to time might be cho&s;en to govern the Church. Who, living here in a Society together, have the Opportuni|ty of getting Experience, of reading Men, and rai&s;ing them&s;elves by degrees above their for|mer Familiarity with the inferiour Country
<PB N="247" REF="325">Clergy. Whereby they fit them&s;elves for Go|vernment and Authority in the Church.</P>
<P>Accordingly in every Cathedral Church in England there is a certain Number of <HI>Prebenda|ries,</HI> or <HI>Canons,</HI> and a <HI>Dean</HI> over them; mo&s;t of them with a plentiful Maintenance, but &s;o that the Dean has commonly a double Por|tion.</P>
<P><HI>Deans</HI> of the old Foundations, which were before the Suppre&s;&s;ion of Mona&s;teries, are brought to their Dignities much like Bi&s;hops. The King fir&s;t &s;ends forth his <HI>Conge d'e&s;lire</HI> to the Chapter, who thereupon proceed to the E|lection. To their Election the King grants his Royal A&s;&s;ent; then the Bi&s;hop confirms the Par|ty elected, and gives his E&s;pi&s;copal Mandate to In&s;tal him. Whereas the Deans of the new Foundations (upon Suppre&s;&s;ion of Abbeys or Priories transformed by Henry VIII, into Dean and Chapter) are In&s;talled a much &s;horter way, by virtue of the King's Letters Patents, without either Election or Confirmation.</P>
<P>In the Cathedral Churches of <HI>S. David,</HI> and of <HI>Landaff,</HI> in Wales, there never has been any Dean. But the Bi&s;hop in either is Head of the Chapter; and, in the Bi&s;hops ab&s;ence, the Chan|ter at <HI>S. Davids,</HI> and at <HI>Landaff</HI> the Arch-Dea|con.</P>
<P>'Tis ob&s;ervable be&s;ides, that there are &s;ome Deans in England without any Juri&s;diction, but only for Honour &s;o called; as the Dean of the Chappel Royal, the Dean of S. George's Chap|pel at Wind&s;or, the Deans of Rippon and Garn&s;ey, and all the Deans created by Henry VIII.</P>
<P>Some Deans there are without any Chapter, that injoy however certain Juri&s;dictions; as the Deans of Croydon, Battel, and Bocking.</P>
<PB N="248" REF="326">
<P>A <HI>Prebendary</HI> is &s;o called (as &s;ome will have it) <HI>a praebendo Auxilium aut Con&s;ilium Epi&s;cope vel Decano,</HI> from giving Help or Coun&s;el to the Bi&s;hop or Dean. Or (as others) from the Word <HI>Prebend,</HI> which &s;ignifies the Portion which every Member or Canon of a Cathedral Church re|ceives for his Maintenance out of the common Stock of the Church. Of which Prebends &s;ome are <HI>Simple,</HI> or have no more but the Revenue towards their Maintenance; and others <HI>with Dignity,</HI> &s;uch as have Juri&s;diction annexed to them, according to the divers Orders of Churches.</P>
<P>Now among the Prebendaries (or Canons) of the old Foundations, &s;ome are <HI>Canonici actu,</HI> &s;uch as have Right to vote in the Chapter. O|thers <HI>Canonici in Herba,</HI> that have a Stall in the Quire, but no Vote in the Chapter; only ha|ving right to the next Prebend that &s;hall be|come void.</P>
<P>The Dean and Prebendaries ought to re&s;ide in their re&s;pective Cathedral and Collegiate Churches, to frequent publick divine Service, to preach by turns upon Sundays and all fe&s;ti|val Days, and at due time to admini&s;ter the Lord's Supper. They ought to in&s;truct the weake&s;t &s;ort of the Country Clergy, to direct them how and what to preach, whereby they may be&s;t profit their Auditors. In &s;hort, they ought to &s;hew good Example to the Inferiour Clergy. And, when &s;ummoned by the Bi&s;hop, they are to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in &s;ome of his Epi&s;copal Functions; as Ordinations, Deprivations <HI>ab Of|ficio &amp; Beneficio,</HI> Condemnation of ob&s;tinate He|reticks, &amp;c. Upon the King's Writ of <HI>Conge d'e&s;lire,</HI> they elect the Bi&s;hop of that Dioce&s;e.</P>
<PB N="249" REF="326">
<P>The chief of the Prebendaries is the <HI>Sub-Dean,</HI> who &s;upplies the Deans part in his ab|&s;ence.</P>
<P><HI>Arch-Deacons</HI> are &s;o called for their Charge over the Deacons, who are in every Dioce&s;e to be guided and directed under the Bi&s;hop there|of by the Arch Deacon, though a Presbyter him&s;elf.</P>
<P>There are of the&s;e 60 in all England, each Dioce&s;e having in it one or more Arch-Dea|conries, for Di&s;patch of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Bu&s;ine&s;s, Their Office is to Vi&s;it two Years in three, the third Year being the Bi&s;hops Vi&s;itation Year. Then the Arch-Deacon is to inquire of Repa|rations and Movables belonging to the Churches under his Juri&s;diction, to reform Abu&s;es in Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical Matters, and to bring the more weigh|ty Affairs before the Bi&s;hop of the Dioce&s;e. Therefore he is called <HI>alter Epi&s;copi Oculus,</HI> the other being the Dean. He is al&s;o, upon the Bi&s;hops Mandate, to Induct Clerks into their Benefices, and thereby to give them Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the Profits thereunto belonging.</P>
<P>Many Arch-Deacons have, by Pre&s;crip|tion, their Courts and Officials, as Bi&s;hops have.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, there are <HI>Rural Deans,</HI> anciently cal|led <HI>Archipresbyteri, &amp; Decani Chri&s;tianitatis,</HI> perhaps becau&s;e they had the Over&s;ight of a cer|tain Number of Prie&s;ts. Now their Office is, upon the Bi&s;hops Orders, to convocate the Cler|gy, to &s;ignify unto them (&s;ometimes by Let|ters) the Bi&s;hops Plea&s;ure, and to give Induction in the Arch-Deacons place, when he lives far off.</P>
<PB N="250" REF="327">
<P>Every Arch-Deaconry is &s;ubdivided into few|er or more Rural Deanries.</P>
<P>Note, that, be&s;ides Bi&s;hopricks, all Deanries are in the Kings Gift; and &s;o are mo&s;t Prebends and Canonicates, with many great, and &s;ome &s;maller Par&s;onages.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIV. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the Inferiour Clengy; Al&s;o, of the Church-Wardens, Side&s;men, and Pari&s;h-Clerks.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>BY the Inferiour Clergy I mean the <HI>Pari&s;h Prie&s;ts,</HI> and <HI>Deacons.</HI> The fir&s;t vulgarly called <HI>Par&s;ons,</HI> are either <HI>Rectors,</HI> or <HI>Vi|cars.</HI> The Prie&s;t of every Pari&s;h is called <HI>Rector,</HI> unle&s;s the Praedial Tythes be Impropriated; and then he has the Title of <HI>Vicar, qua&s;i vice fungens Rectoris.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, as I &s;aid before page 236, there are three Orders in the Church of England, Bi&s;hops, Prie&s;ts, and Deacons. That of Deacons is the fir&s;t &s;tep into the Service of the Church, and &s;eems only mini&s;terial to the Prie&s;tly Office. For the Charge of Deacons is to take care of the Poor, baptize, read in the Church, a&s;&s;i&s;t the Prie&s;t at the Lord's Supper, by giving the Cup|only. And this is properly to fit and prepare him for the Prie&s;tly Office.</P>
<PB N="251" REF="327">
<P>None may be admitted a Deacon before the Age of 23 Years, without a Di&s;pen&s;ation; nor may a Deacon be admitted into the Prie&s;tly Or|der, without a Di&s;pen&s;ation, till he has &s;erved as Deacon the &s;pace of one Year.</P>
<P>The Ordination of Prie&s;ts and Deacons is performed four times in the Year, upon four &s;everal Sundays in the Ember Weeks. Which, by the Laws of the Church, is a Time of Prayer and Fa&s;ting for the whole Nation, that &s;o by their joynt Prayers they may recommend to God all that are to receive Ordination. Tho&s;e are the Weeks called <HI>Quatuor Tempora</HI> by the ancient Fathers, and of great Antiquity in the Church. The proper Days for this Devotion are the <HI>Wedne&s;day, Friday,</HI> and <HI>Saturday</HI> next after Quadrage&s;ima Sunday, after Holy-Rood Day in September, and S. Lucies Day in De|cember.</P>
<P>The Ordination is performed in a mo&s;t &s;o|lemn, grave, and devout manner, by a Bi&s;hop, a&s;&s;i&s;ted with &s;ome of the Dignified Clergy, or others in Prie&s;tly Order. I begin with that of Deacons, which is thus</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, after Morning Prayer, there is a Ser|mon about the Duty and Office of Deacons and Prie&s;ts. The Sermon ended, tho&s;e that &s;tand for Deacons being decently habited are pre&s;ent|ed to the Bi&s;hop by the Arch-Deacon, or his Deputy. Whom the Bi&s;hop asks, if he has made due Inquiry of them; and then asks the Peo|ple, if they Know any notable Impediment or Crime in any of them. Then follow certain godly Prayers, with the Collect, and Epi&s;tle ap|pointed for this Solemnity. After which, the Oath of Supremacy is admini&s;tred to every one of them; and the Bi&s;hop puts divers godly Que&s;tions to them. Which being an&s;wered,
<PB N="252" REF="328">they all Kneel; and he laying his Hands up|on them &s;everally does Ordain them Deacons. Then he delivers to every one of them the New Te&s;tament, and gives them Authority to read the &s;ame in the Church. Whereup|on the Bi&s;hop appoints one of them to read the Go&s;pel. This done, they with the Bi|&s;hop proceed to the Communion; and &s;o are di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with the Ble&s;&s;ing pronounced by the Bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>The Ordination of Prie&s;ts is much after the &s;ame manner. Only the Epi&s;tle and Go&s;pel are different; and, after the Que&s;tions and An|&s;wers made, the Bi&s;hop puts up a particular Prayer for them. Which being ended, he de&s;ires the Congregation to recommend them to God &s;ecretly in their Prayers; for doing of which there is a competent time of general Si|lence. Then follows <HI>Veni Creator Spiritus,</HI> in Meter to be &s;ung. And, after another Prayer, they all Kneeling, the Bi&s;hop, with one or two of the grave Prie&s;ts there pre&s;ent, lays his Hands upon the Head of every one of them &s;everally, and &s;o gives them Ordination in a grave &s;et Form of Words, different both from that of Bi&s;hops, and that of Deacons. The re&s;t is the &s;ame as in the Ordaining of Dea|cons.</P>
<P>What the Office of a Pari&s;h-Prie&s;t is, is &s;o well known, that I need not in&s;i&s;t upon it. His Or|ders he has from the Bi&s;hop, but the Benefice he holds from the Patron. Now we call tho&s;e <HI>Patrons of Churches,</HI> who by fir&s;t building of Churches, or fir&s;t indowing them with I ands, have obtained for them and their Heirs a Right of Advow&s;on or Patronage. Who, when the Church is void, is to propo&s;e a fit Clerk to
<PB N="253" REF="328">the Bi&s;hop, to be by him Canonically In&s;titu|ted.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Revenues</HI> of the Inferiour Clergy, they are (as in all Places) unequally divided. So that &s;ome Par&s;ons have a very plentiful, &s;ome but a competent, and others but a &s;mall Maintenance; &s;ome two or three hundred pounds <HI>per Annum</HI> or more, others one hun|dred or thereabouts, and &s;ome much &s;hort of that. Which, be&s;ides the Glebe-Land, is mo&s;tly rai&s;ed by way of Tythes, and the Du|ties paid for Chri&s;tenings, Marriages, and Fu|nerals.</P>
<P>The Plurality of Benefices, that is, the Pri|viledge of holding more Livings than one, al|lowed by the Church of England for the In|couragement of worthy and eminent Divines, makes room for many <HI>Curates.</HI> So we call tho&s;e who officiate in tho&s;e Churches, where &s;uch as hold Plurality of Livings do not Keep their Re&s;idence. The&s;e <HI>Curates</HI> are &s;uch Clergy-men as they think fit to appoint in their places, with &s;uch an Allowance as is a|greed upon among&s;t them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The Condition of <HI>Vicars</HI> is much the &s;ame as that of Curates, if not wor&s;e. The&s;e pro|perly officiate in tho&s;e Livings which are cal|led <HI>Impropriations,</HI> of which there are in Eng|land no le&s;s than 3845. For above a third part of the be&s;t Benefices of England, being an|ciently by the Popes Grant appropriated to Mo|na&s;teries towards their Maintenance, were upon the Di&s;&s;olution of the Mona&s;teries made Lay|fees. Which Benefices ever &s;ince have been ac|cordingly provided, not with the be&s;t Allow|ances, nor with the be&s;t of the Clergy.</P>
<PB N="254" REF="329">
<P>Among&s;t the <HI>Priviledges</HI> of the Clergy, this is one of the principal, that all Deans, Arch-Deacons, Prebendaries, Rectors, and Vicars may, &s;ome by them&s;elves, others by Proxy or by Repre&s;entative, &s;it and vote (as Commons Spiritual) in the Lower Hou&s;e of Convoca|tion.</P>
<P>No Sub&s;idies, or other Tax to the King, might formerly be laid upon them, without their own Con&s;ent fir&s;t had in Convocation. And indeed the Clergy paying to the King the fir&s;t Fruits, that is, the fir&s;t Years Profits of all Spiritual Benefices, and yearly the Tenth of all the &s;aid Benefices, 'twas thought but rea&s;onable they &s;hould be exempted from all other Taxes. Though, to give the Laity good Example, they have often laid upon them&s;elves Sub&s;idies, and other great Taxes.</P>
<P>The Glebe-Lands, and Spiritual Revenues of Clergy-men, being held <HI>in pura &amp; perpe|tua Eleemo&s;yna,</HI> that is (as the Law calls it) in <HI>Frankalmoine,</HI> are exempted from arraying and Mu&s;tering of Men, or Hor&s;es for the War. And, as by their Function they are prohibited to wear any Arms, therefore they cannot &s;erve per&s;onally in War. But they &s;erve their Coun|try otherwi&s;e, by being our Leaders in our Spi|ritual Warfare.</P>
<P>Neither can any Clergy-man be compelled to undergo any other Per&s;onal Functions, or Services in the Common-wealth. For, if any Man, by rea&s;on of his Land, be liable to be elected to any Servile Office, if he takes Or|ders, he is free, and there lies a Writ purpo&s;ely to free him.</P>
<PB N="255" REF="329">
<P>Clergy-Men are not obliged to appear at Sheriffs Turns, or Courts-Leet, there to take their Oath of Allegiance.</P>
<P>By <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> no Clergy-man ought to he Fined or Amerced according to his Spiritual Means, but according to his Temporal E&s;tate, and to the Crime committed.</P>
<P>The Goods of Clergy-men are di&s;charged, by the Common Law of England, from Tolls and Cu&s;toms of Average, Pontage, Murage, and Panage; for which they have the King's Writ to di&s;charge them, provided they don't trade with them.</P>
<P>All Clergy-men are free from the King's Purveyors, Carriages, Po&s;t, &amp;c. for which they may demand a Protection from the King, with the Clau&s;e <HI>Nolumus.</HI></P>
<P>As to the whole <HI>Number of the Clergy</HI> in England, be&s;ides the two Archbi&s;hops, and the twenty four Bi&s;hops, there are 26 Deans of Cathedral and Collegiate Churches, 576 Prebendaries, 9653 Rectors and Vicars; be|&s;ides as many more Curates and others in ho|ly Orders.</P>
<P>In point of Learning and good exemplary Life, England (I dare &s;ay) is outdone by no Clergy in the Chri&s;tian World. If, among&s;t the Inferiour Clergy there be &s;ome ignorant lewd Livers, the dignified Clergy, and the E|pi&s;copal Colledge, are generally Men noted both for their great Piety and deep Learning. And the late Scuffle they had with the Roma|ni&s;ts in &s;o difficult a Juncture as King James his Reign, as it has &s;ufficiently &s;hewn the greatne&s;s of their Parts and the Depth of their Learning, &s;o it expre&s;&s;ed to the World their
<PB N="256" REF="330">&s;trong and invincible Zeal for the Prote&s;tant Religion, and the gro&s;s Mi&s;take of Di&s;&s;enters that lookt upon them as broad-faced Pa|pi&s;ts.</P>
<P>Nothing troubles me more, than to &s;ee &s;ome of the Clergy &s;o much infatuated as to indea|vour to defeat (as far as in them lies) the late &s;ignal Providence, that re&s;cued us &s;o wonder|fully from Popery and Slavery. I do not re|flect upon tho&s;e who remain quiet under their Scruples of Con&s;cience, and are not &s;o far di&s;turbed in their Mind as to di&s;turb the Go|vernment. But to &s;ee &s;ome &s;o low-&s;pirited as to fall a hugging their old Enemies the French, and admire them as their Tutelar Angels who were but 'tother Day the greate&s;t Object of their Scorn and Contempt, this affords matter of admiration. 'Tis pretty to &s;ee the Temper of the&s;e Men, and tho&s;e they have infected, all made up of Contradictions. They hate their Friends, and love their Enemies. They deride Popery, and yet do their utmo&s;t to bring it in. None more aver&s;e than they from Slave|ry, but leave no Stone unturned to work it into the&s;e Kingdoms. Who&s;e Condition is like that of a Sick Per&s;on, that longs for Health, and yet is greedy to catch at any Thing that plea&s;es his Fancy, let it prove never &s;o fatal. The Truth is, 'tis nothing el&s;e in the bottom but a malignant Humour, that cau&s;es Inflam|mation, and &s;trikes up to the Brain; lately a catching, but now (thanks be to God) a va|ni&s;hing Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>I conclude with the <HI>Pari&s;h-Church Officers,</HI> which are indeed Lay-men; but, as they have a peculiar Relation to the Church, they may be counted to be half-Clergy-men.</P>
<PB N="257" REF="330">
<P>The <HI>Church-Wardens,</HI> among&s;t the&s;e, are the principal. Who&s;e Office is to &s;ee, that the Church be in good Repair, and want nothing for Divine Service, &amp;c. That the Church-yard be well inclo&s;ed, and an exact Terrier of the Glebe-Land be Kept. They are al&s;o to &s;ue for any Thing Kept from the Church, that is of right belonging to it; to inquire after, ad|moni&s;h, and pre&s;ent to the Bi&s;hop &s;candalous Livers, and to collect the Charity of the Pa|ri&s;hioners. The Bi&s;hops Orders they are both to declare, and to execute.</P>
<P>They &s;erve commonly two Years in that Sta|tion, and Ea&s;ter-Week is the time for their E|lection. U&s;ually they are elected by the Par&s;on and the Pari&s;hioners, where it is &s;o agreed. If not, the Par&s;on chu&s;es one, and the Pari&s;hio|ners the other.</P>
<P>In &s;ome great Pari&s;hes there are joyned <HI>Side&s;men</HI> to the Church-Wardens, to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in the Inquiries into the Lives of inor|dinate Livers, and in pre&s;enting Offenders at Vi&s;itations.</P>
<P>Next is the <HI>Clerk,</HI> who&s;e Office is to &s;erve at Church the Prie&s;t and Church-Wardens. He ought to be at lea&s;t 20 Years old, and a Man of good Life and Conver&s;ation, that can read, write, and &s;ing P&s;alms, the tuning whereof is part of his Office. He is commonly cho&s;en by the Par&s;on only.</P>
<P>In many Pari&s;hes there is al&s;o one <HI>Sexton,</HI> or more. So we call tho&s;e that attend the Pa|ri&s;hioners at Church, and let them into their Pews.

<HEAD>CHAP. XXV. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of Women.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>ALL Women in England are either <HI>Noble,</HI> or <HI>Ignoble.</HI> The fir&s;t are &s;o by <HI>De&s;cent, Creation,</HI> or <HI>Marriage.</HI></P>
<P>By <HI>De&s;cent,</HI> as when a Lady holds an E&s;tate by a noble Title. For Titles of Honour &s;ome|times, for want of Males, do de&s;cend to Fe|males. But only to one of them, becau&s;e they are Things in their own nature intire, and not to be divided among&s;t many, as the Lands and Tenements are, which de&s;cend in equal Propor|tion to all the Daughters. By <HI>Creation,</HI> &s;ome Women have been made, at the King's plea&s;ure, Barone&s;&s;es, Counte&s;&s;es, and Dutche&s;&s;es.</P>
<PB N="259" REF="331">
<P>But the greate&s;t Part of the Engli&s;h Noble|women are &s;o only by <HI>Marriage,</HI> all Women being counted Noble that are married to any Peer of the Realm. And &s;o (as the Law &s;ays) <HI>Uxor fulget Radiis Mariti.</HI></P>
<P>Yet, if afterwards they marry to Men not No|ble, they lo&s;e by Law their former Dignity, and follow their latter Husbands Condition; though by the Courte&s;y of England, they are &s;till lookt upon and re&s;pected as Noble, and called by the Name of the former Husband. But Women, Noble by De&s;cent or Birth-right, or by Creation, retain by Law their Nobility, tho they Marry afterwards to Husbands under their Degree.</P>
<P>'Tis ob&s;ervable, that any Noble-woman by Birth, being married to a Baron, takes place but as Barone&s;s, though &s;he be a Duke's Daughter. But, if &s;he marry to one under the Degree of a Nobleman, as to a Knight or Gentleman, the Courte&s;y of England gives her place according to her Birth, and not her Husbands Condi|tion.</P>
<P>A Noble-woman marrying to an Ignoble Man adds no Honour to him. Her Honour is all hers, and he has no &s;hare in it, though by Marriage he becomes Ma&s;ter of all her Goods and Chattels. But her Dignities with the Lands, de&s;cend to her next Heir.</P>
<P>Noble-women, in the Eye of the Law, are Peers of the Realm; and accordingly they in|joy mo&s;t of the Priviledges of Peers. But it is thought, they cannot maintain an Action upon the Statute <HI>De Scandalo Magnatum.</HI></P>
<P>As happy as the Condition of married Wo|men is generally all over England, yet the Laws of this Kingdom are in the main very &s;e|vere
<PB N="260" REF="332">upon them. For, when a Woman marries, &s;he gives her &s;elf over, and what &s;he brings with her, to the power of her Husband. What|ever &s;he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, the Husband becomes the Proprietor of it; and her very nece&s;&s;ary Appa|rel is not hers in Propriety. If &s;he has any Te|nure, it is all <HI>in Capite,</HI> that is, &s;he holds it of, and by her Husband, who is the Head of his Wife. And all the Chattels per&s;onal &s;he had at the Marriage are &s;o much her Husbands, that, he dying before her, they &s;hall not return to his Wife, but go with his other Goods and Chattels to the Husband's Executor or Admini&s;trator. Except the <HI>Paraphernalia,</HI> that is, tho&s;e Goods which a Wife, be&s;ides her Dower or Joyn|ture, is after her Husbands Death allowed to have, as Furniture for her Chamber, wear|ing Apparel, and Jewels if &s;he be of quali|ty; which are not to be put into her Hus|band's Inventory, e&s;pecially in the Province of York.</P>
<P>The Wife can make no Contract without her Husband's Con&s;ent; and without it &s;he cannot &s;et, &s;ell, give away, or alienate any Thing.</P>
<P>So great is her Subjection to her Husband's Will, that, in the Sen&s;e of the Law, &s;he has no Will of her own. Therefore, when a Man and his Wife commit a Felony together, the Wife can neither be Principal, nor Acce&s;&s;ory; the Law &s;uppo&s;ing &s;he was forced thereunto, in regard of the Subjection and Obedience &s;he ows to her Husband.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, by the Law of England, a Wife is &s;o much in the Power of her Husband, that &s;he is no better than a Child, or the be&s;t of Ser|vants. For &s;he can call nothing her own, more
<PB N="261" REF="332">than a Child, whom his Father &s;uffers to call many Things his own, yet can di&s;po&s;e of no|thing. And, when &s;he offends, 'tis in her Husband's Power to correct her, as a Servant. Therefore, if &s;he wrong another by her Tongue, on by Tre&s;pa&s;s, her Husband mu&s;t an&s;wer for her Fault, and make Satisfaction.</P>
<P>But a Woman, upon Marriage, does not on|ly lo&s;e the Power over her Per&s;on, Will and Goods; but &s;he mu&s;t part with her very Name, and ever after u&s;e her Husband's Surname, contrary to the Cu&s;tom of &s;ome other Coun|tries.</P>
<P>One Thing more there is yet which eviden|ces the great Subjection of a Wife to her Husband. And that is the Puni&s;hment inflict|ed upon a Woman that has Killed her Hus|band, which is to be Burnt alive; the Offence being counted Petty-Trea&s;on by Law, that is, as great a Crime as the Killing of his Father, or Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Yet in &s;ome things the Law is very favour|able to the female Sex of England. As for Ex|ample, if a Wife bring forth a Child begotten before Marriage by another Man than her pre|&s;ent Husband, her Husband is bound to own the Child, and that Child &s;hall be his Heir at Law. So literally we take the Saying, <HI>Pater e&s;t quem Nuptiae demon&s;trant.</HI></P>
<P>If a Husband be a long time ab&s;ent from his Wife, though it be for &s;ome Years, and his Wife bring forth a Child during his Ab&s;ence, he mu&s;t father that Child, in ca&s;e he lived all the while in this I&s;land, or (to &s;peak the Words of the Law) <HI>inter quatuor Maria.</HI> And, if that Child be her fir&s;t-born Son, and her Husband's E|&s;tate
<PB N="262" REF="333">Intailed, or left without Will, that Child &s;hall be Heir to it.</P>
<P>Another Priviledge of Engli&s;h-Women is, that the Wife having no Joynture &s;ettled before Marriage, may challenge, after her Husband's Death, the third part of his yearly Rents of Land during her Life; and within the City of London, a third Part of all her Husband's Mo|veables for ever. If there be many Children, the re&s;t comes to the elde&s;t; if not, to the next Heir at Law. And, if &s;he do not approve of the Divi&s;ion, &s;he may claim the Right of being Indowed with the be&s;t of the Land, to a third part.</P>
<P>But, if the Law be &s;o favourable in &s;ome Ca&s;es to married Women, Cu&s;tom, or rather the good Nature of Engli&s;hmen, makes their Condition much happier. Who&s;e Re&s;pect and Tenderne&s;s for them is generally &s;o great, that every where they give 'em the Precedency, and put them the lea&s;t of any Nation upon Drud|gery and Hard&s;hip. Women are not here mew|ed up as in Italy and Spain; and that mi&s;|chievous Pa&s;&s;ion of Jealou&s;y has got &s;o little footing here, that the Nation is little troubled with its trouble&s;om Influences, or fatal Con|&s;equences. In &s;hort, married Women have here more Liberty, than any where el&s;e. Their chief Care is of the Hou&s;e and Hou&s;hold, ac|cording to the ancient Cu&s;tom of the Greek Wives; which is indeed the proper Office of a Wife, as the Husband's is to mind his Con|cerns abroad.</P>
<P>And &s;uch is generally their Carriage to their Husbands, and their mutual Tenderne&s;s for them, that, where the Law gives them nothing, the dying Husband often leaves all behind him to the Di&s;po&s;al of his Wife. Except in Lon|don,
<PB N="263" REF="333">where a peculiar Order is taken by the City agreeable to the Civil Law.</P>
<P>A Knight's Wife is, by the Courte&s;y of England, counted and called a Lady. If her Husband die before her, and &s;he take afterwards <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Husband of a lower e&s;tate, &s;till &s;he &s;hall be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">alled Lady with the &s;urname of her fir&s;t husband, and not of the &s;econd. Which is by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he Courte&s;y of England, and according to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">adies of a higher Rank, as I have before ob|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erved.</P>
<P>In point of real E&s;tate, 'tis Ob&s;ervable, that, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f the Wife be an Heire&s;s, and bring to her Husband an E&s;tate in Land, that Land de&s;cends <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o her elde&s;t Son; and, if &s;he has no Sons, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut only Daughters, it is divided among&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hem. But, if &s;he dies without I&s;&s;ue, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">and goes immediately to the next Heir at Law. Only the Husband &s;hall enjoy the Pro|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">es thereof during his Life, if &s;o be that he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d a Child alive of her Body, that had been heard once to cry. And this al&s;o is called the Courte&s;y of England.</P>
<P>As to what I &s;aid before touching real and per&s;onal E&s;tates in ca&s;e of Matrimony, the &s;ame is to be under&s;tood in the &s;en&s;e of the Common Law, where there is no private Contract. For whatever Contract or Covenants were made before the Marriage betwixt the husband and the Wife, either by them&s;elves, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y their Parents, or Friends, they take place, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd are of force to be Kept according to the Validity thereof.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, the Wife in England is accounted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> much one with her Husband, that &s;he cannot
<PB N="264" REF="334">be produced as Witne&s;s for or again&s;t her Husband. And &s;o &s;trong is the Tie that joyns them together, that they may not be wholly Se|parated by any Agreement between them&s;elves, but only by a Judicial Sentence.</P>
<P>Now there is a twofold Separation, both cal|led by the name of Divorce. The one in ca&s;e of Adultery, <HI>a Men&s;a &amp; Thoro,</HI> Which is no|thing el&s;e but a living a&s;under, without a li|berty-to Remarry, whil&s;t either Party is alive. Whereas the other is <HI>a Vinculo Matrimonii,</HI> from the Bond of Matrimony, whereby each Party is free to Remarry. And this is allowed upon a Nullity of the Marriage, or upon &s;ome e&s;&s;en|tial Impediment, as Con&s;anguinity or Affinity within the Degrees forbidden, Precontract, Impotency, or &s;uch like. Of which Divines reckon fourteen, according to the&s;e Ver&s;es,

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of Children, and Servants.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>FRom the Condition of Women in Eng|land, I come now to that of <HI>Children</HI> and <HI>Servants.</HI> As to the fir&s;t, a Father in England has a more ab&s;olute Authority over his Children, than is u&s;ual in our Neighbour Countries. Here a Father may give all his E&s;tate Unintailed from his Children, and all to one Child; the Con&s;ideration whereof is apt to keep his Children in aw, and within the bounds of filial Obedience.</P>
<P>But commonly the elde&s;t Son inherits all Lands, and the younger Children Goods and Chattels, by which is meant the Per&s;onal E|&s;tate. Among the Nobility and Gentry, the elde&s;t Son's Wife's Portion does u&s;ually go for the Portions of his Si&s;ters; and the younger Sons are put out to &s;ome Profe&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;on why the elde&s;t Son is &s;o well provided beyond the re&s;t of the Children is, that he may be the better able to bear up the Honour of the Family, which in cour&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">alls to the &s;hare of the Elde&s;t. For, when all is done, Titular Honour without Means, is commonly lookt upon but as an empty Sha|dow.</P>
<PB N="266" REF="335">
<P>But, if there be no Son, the Lands, as well as Goods, are equally divided among the Daughters.</P>
<P>A Son at the Age of 14, his Father being dead, may chu&s;e his Gardian, and may claim his Land holden in Socage, that is, &s;uch Lands as Tenants hold by, or for certain inferi|our Services of Husbandry to be performed to the Lord of the Fee. He is free to con&s;ent to Marriage, and may by Will di&s;po&s;e of Goods and Chattels.</P>
<P>At the Age of 15, he ought to be Sworn to his Allegiance to the King; at 21 he is &s;aid to be of full Age. Then he is free to make any Contracts, and to pa&s;s by Will both Goods and Lands; which in other Countries may not be done till the Age of 25, called <HI>Annus Con&s;i&s;tentiae.</HI></P>
<P>A Daughter at the Age of 7 Years, may con&s;ent to Marriage; but at 12, &s;he is free to retract or confirm it. If &s;he confirms it, then the Marriage is good, and &s;he may make a Will of Goods and Chattels.</P>
<P>At 21 &s;he may Contract, or Alienate her Lands by Will, or otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Servants</HI> in England are either tied to a certain Number of Years, or only by the Year; the&s;e being free to quit their Service at &s;uch a Warning as is agreed upon between the Ma&s;ter (or the Mi&s;tris) and the Ser|vant.</P>
<P>By tho&s;e that are tied to a certain Num|ber of Years, I mean <HI>Apprentices,</HI> the u&s;ual Time for their Apprenti&s;hip being 7 Years. This is the mo&s;t Servile Condition in England,
<PB N="267" REF="335">con&s;idering the La&s;h they ly under, together with their long and &s;trict Confinement, under Articles. And, whereas other Servants re|ceive Wages for their Service, the&s;e common|ly do pay a Sum of Mony to their Ma&s;ters for their Prentice&s;hip.</P>
<P>The Condition of other <HI>Servants</HI> is much ea&s;ier all over England. For, be&s;ides that few undergo the Hard&s;hip that Prentices do, they may be free at the Years end, giving 3 Months Warning; and, if a Servant do not like one Ma&s;ter, he may go to another, where perhaps he may find more favour or advantage. But, before a Per&s;on ventures upon &s;uch a Servant, 'tis civil fir&s;t to get his former Ma&s;ters Leave, and prudential to have from him a te&s;timony of his faithfulne&s;s and dili|gence.</P>
<P>Now there are &s;o many Degrees of <HI>Ser|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ants</HI> in England, that if &s;ome live meanly, there are others who live genteely, and &s;ome of the&s;e &s;o &s;plendidly as to keep Servants of their own. In great Families where a Per|&s;on of quality makes a proper Figure, and has a &s;utable Attendance, there is a nece&s;&s;ary Subordination of Servants; &s;o that the Infe|riour Servants may be at the beck of their Superiour Officers, to an&s;wer the &s;everal parts of their re&s;pective Duties. Thus a great Man lives like a Prince, and Keeps a Court of his own.</P>
<P>In general it may be &s;aid, no Country is more favourable than England to Servants; who generally live here with more ea&s;e and le&s;s Subjection, and have larger Salaries than any where el&s;e.</P>

<P>The truth is, if we con&s;ider the nature of a Servant, how by going to Service he deve&s;ts him&s;elf of what is deare&s;t to Mankind, his Li|berty, and Subjects his Will to another, who &s;ometimes proves magget-headed, cruel, or ty|rannical, I think it but rea&s;onable, to have a tender Regard for good Servants. For this, among&s;t other Things, was that great Man of Spain, Cardinal <HI>Ximenes,</HI> &s;o noted in his time; who proved &s;o bountiful and &s;o generous a Ma&s;ter to his Servants, that Hi&s;tory to this day does admire him for it.</P>
<P>As for &s;tubborn and unruly Servants, the Law of England gives Ma&s;ters and Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es Power to correct them; and Re&s;i&s;tance in a Servant is puni&s;hed with &s;evere Penalty. But for a Servant to Kill his Ma&s;ter or Mi&s;tris is &s;o high a Crime, that it is counted Petty Trea|&s;on, or a Crime next to High Trea&s;on.</P>
<P>Since Chri&s;tianity prevailed here, England admits of no forein <HI>Slaves.</HI> In forein Planta|tions indeed, the Engli&s;h, as other Nations, buy and &s;ell Negro's as Slaves. But a forein Slave brought over into England is, upon Land|ing, <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> free from Slavery, though not from ordinary Service.</P>
<P>'Tis true there has been a &s;ort of Tenure here, called a Tenure in <HI>Villenage,</HI> and the Te|nant <HI>Villain,</HI> who was in effect a Bond-man to the Lord of the Land. For the Lord might take Redemption of him to marry his Daugh|ter, and to make him free. He might put him out of his Lands and Tenements, Goods and Chattels, at his Will; and might beat and cha&s;ti&s;e, but not maim him. Now &s;uch <HI>Vil|lains</HI> are out of date, though the Law con|cerning them &s;tands unrepealed to this day.

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the Parliament of England.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE <HI>High Court of Parliament</HI> being the Great Council of England, the Supreme Court of Judicature, and One of the mo&s;t Augu&s;t A&s;&s;emblies the World, is the Court that I am to &s;peak in the fir&s;t place.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="339">
<P>It came to be called <HI>Parliament</HI> from the French <HI>Parlement,</HI> and this from their Verb <HI>Parler</HI> to &s;peak (or talk) together. The &s;ame is taken in a two-fold Sen&s;e. Fir&s;t, as it includes the Legi&s;lative Power of England, as when we &s;ay an <HI>Act of Parliament.</HI> In which Accepta|tion it includes the King, Lords, and Commons; each of which have a Negative Voice in ma|king Laws, &s;o that without their joynt Con&s;ent no Law can by either abrogated, or made. Se|condly, in a Vulgar Sen&s;e; as when we &s;ay <HI>the King and Parliament,</HI> or the <HI>King has called a Parliament,</HI> by which is meant the Two Hou&s;es, <HI>viz.</HI> the Hou&s;e of Lords and the Hou&s;e of Commons.</P>
<P>This Court is a Body Corporate, con&s;i&s;ting (according to the fir&s;t Acceptation of the Word) of the Three E&s;tates of the Realm. And though the Name <HI>Parliament,</HI> by which it is now called, be not probably older than the Con|que&s;t by William Duke of Normandy; yet 'tis made plain by ancient Records and Precedents, that the former Kings of England, even in the Saxons-time, had from time to time great Na|tional Councils, much of the &s;ame nature as our Parliaments. In the Saxons Time, &s;ays <HI>Lam|bard,</HI> the great Council of the Nation con&s;i&s;ted of the King, Lords, and Commons. It is mo&s;t apparent, (&s;ays <HI>Prinn</HI>) by all the old Prece|dents before the Conque&s;t, that all our ancien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Councils were nothing el&s;e but Parliaments, cal|led by different Names in &s;everal Ages, till at la&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that of Parliament was fixed upon them; and that our Kings, Nobles, Senators, Aldermen Wi&s;emen, Knights, and Commons were u&s;uall pre&s;ent, and voted there as Members and Judge The &s;ame is averred by many Records an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Precedents touching this Matter, in the Appen|dix
<PB N="3" REF="339">to <HI>Petyt</HI>'s <HI>Mi&s;cellanea Parliamentaria.</HI> Which does not quadrate with the Opinion of tho&s;e who have affirmed, that there was never any Parliament in England, according to the pre|&s;ent Con&s;titution thereof, till the Reign of Hen|ry III, that is, betwixt four and five hundred Years &s;ince; and that the grand Council con&s;i&s;ted on|ly of the great Men of the Nation, till that King was plea&s;ed to call the Commons to &s;it al&s;o in Parliament.</P>
<P>The Power of Convening (or Calling) a Par|liament is &s;olely in the King. But, if the King be under Age, or not <HI>Compos Mentis,</HI> or Ab|&s;ent out of the Realm upon &s;ome Expedition, 'tis lodged in the Protector or Regent, who then &s;ummons the Parliament, but &s;till in the King's Name.</P>
<P>The Summons ought to be at lea&s;t 40 Days before the Day appointed for the Meeting; and it is done by Writ in Law-Latin, expre&s;&s;ing that it is with the Advice of the Privy Council. Which Writ is a kind of &s;hort Letter directed and &s;ent by the Lord Chancellour (or Commi&s;|&s;ioners of the Chancery) to every Lord Spiri|tual and Temporal, to appear at a certain Time and Place, to treat and give their Advice in &s;ome important Affairs concerning the Church and State, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And, as for the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, Writs are &s;ent to all the Sheriffs, com|manding them to &s;ummon the People to elect two Knights for each County, two Citizens for each City, and one or two Burge&s;&s;es for each Borough, according to Statute, Charter, or Cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>And, whereas there are &s;ome Cities and Towns that are Counties of them&s;elves, or that have each within it &s;elf the Priviledge of a
<PB N="4" REF="340">County, the Writ is directed to them as it is to Sheriffs of other Counties.</P>
<P>At every County, after the Delivery of the Parliament Writ to the Sheriffs, Proclamation is made in the full County of the Day and Place appointed for the Parliament to &s;it, and for all Freeholders to attend &s;uch a Time and Place for the Election of the Knights for that County. But the Sheriff ought to give a con|venient Time for the Day of Election, and &s;uf|ficient Warning to tho&s;e that have Voices, that they may be pre&s;ent. Otherwi&s;e the Election is not good, if, for want of due Notice, part of the Electors be ab&s;ent.</P>
<P>Now, by an Act in the Reign of Henry VI, it was Ordained, that none &s;hould have any Suffrage in the Election of the Knights of the Shire, but &s;uch as were Freeholders, did re&s;ide in the County, and had a yearly Revenue, at lea&s;t to the Value of 40 Shillings; which, be|fore the Di&s;covery of the Gold and Silver in A|merica, was as much as 30 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> now. And the Sheriff has Power by the &s;aid Act to examine upon Oath every &s;uch Chu&s;er, how much he may expend by the Year, if he doubt the value of it.</P>
<P>If any Man keep a Hou&s;hold in one County, and remain in Service with another Family in another County, yet he may be at the Chu&s;ing of Knights of the Shire where he Keeps his Family; for it &s;hall be &s;aid in Law a Dwelling in that County.</P>
<P>The Election ought to be in full County be|tween 8 and 9 of the Clock, according to Sta|tute. And no Election (&s;ays the Lord <HI>Coke</HI>) can be made of any Knight of the Shire but between 8 and 11 of the Clock in the Forenoon. But, if the Election be begun within the
<PB N="5" REF="340">Time, and cannot be determined within tho&s;e Hours, the Election may be proceeded up|on.</P>
<P>Before Election can be made, or Voices gi|ven, the Precept directed to the Sheriff ought to be read and publi&s;hed. And, if the Party or Freeholders demand the Poll, the Sheriff ought not to deny the Scrutiny, for he cannot di&s;cern who be Freeholders by the View. In &s;hort, of &s;o many as &s;tand for Competitors, the two that have mo&s;t Voices are declared to be duly elected for the in&s;uing Parlia|ment.</P>
<P>Plurality of Voices does likewi&s;e carry it for Citizens that &s;tand for Cities, and Burge&s;&s;es for Boroughs. Where in &s;ome Places none but Freeholders have a Right of Election, in others all Hou&s;holders have a &s;hare in it. And, though no Alien can be a Parliament Man; yet, if he be a Hou&s;holder, his Voice is good, as in the E|lection of the Members for the City of We&s;t|min&s;ter.</P>
<P>A Burge&s;s elected for two &s;everal Boroughs, as it &s;ometimes happens, mu&s;t wave one Election when he comes to the Hou&s;e, and chu&s;e for which Place of the two he will &s;erve; &s;o as a Writ may i&s;&s;ue for a new Election, that the Number may be full.)</P>
<P>All Elections ought to be freely and indiffe|rently made, notwith&s;tanding any Prayer or Command to the contrary. Or el&s;e the Parlia|ment is not, as it &s;hould be, free. 'Tis true the Elections can never be &s;o free, as not to be lia|ble to the Temptations of private Intere&s;t, or the Influence of Fea&s;ting, two unavoidable E|vils. Yet it does not follow but that a Parlia|ment may be called Free, when the Court has no hand in the Elections by &s;uch unlaw|ful
<PB N="6" REF="341">Methods as were u&s;ed in the late Reign, by Clo&s;etting, by fair Promi&s;es, and foul Threats.</P>
<P>The Returns concerning the Parties cho&s;en are made in the Crown-Office, by the Sheriffs, Mayors, or Bayliffs, whom the Writs were &s;ent to, and to whom it belongs to manage the Elections.</P>
<P>Upon a fal&s;e Return, which happens but too frequently, the Sheriff who made the Return is liable to the Forfeiture of 100 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> to the King, and 100 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> more to the Party injured, and to be Impri&s;oned for a Year without Bail or Mainprize And every Mayor or Magi&s;trate of a Town &s;o offending, is to pay 40 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> to the King, and as much to the Party. This Action to be within 3 Months after the Parliament commenced by the Party injured, or by any other Man who will.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Party returned remains a Member of the Hou&s;e, till his Election be de|clared void by the &s;ame.</P>
<P>For denying the Poll when required, al&s;o for advi&s;ing and abetting the &s;ame, the guilty Par|ty has been adjudged by the Hou&s;e to &s;tand Committed to the Sergeant during Plea&s;ure, to pay all due Fees, to defray the Charge of Wit|ne&s;&s;es, to be A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by four of the Committee, to acknowledge his Offence upon his Knees at the Bar, and read a Submi&s;&s;ion. This was the Ca&s;e of <HI>Thom&s;on</HI> Sheriff of York, and his A|bettor Alderman <HI>Henlow,</HI> in the Reign of Charles I.</P>
<P>The Per&s;ons to be Elected as the fitte&s;t to an|&s;wer the true Intere&s;t of the Nation, ought to be Sober, Under&s;tanding, Well-principled, and Well-affected to the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Government by Law. If Men of E&s;tates, it is &s;o much the
<PB N="7" REF="341">better, &s;uch Men being &s;uppo&s;ed to be le&s;s Cor|ruptible. But this is left to the Peoples Choice.</P>
<P>'Tis true, that by Law &s;uch as &s;tand for Knights of the Shire ought to be Knights, E&s;quires, or Gentlemen fit to be made Knights.</P>
<P>By the Statute none ought to be cho&s;en a Burge&s;s of a Town in which he do's not in|habit. But the U&s;age of Parliament di&s;pen&s;es with that Act.</P>
<P>Neither can any be legally cho&s;en that is not of full Age, that is, 21 Years old at lea&s;t. And rea&s;on good, for, if no Man under that Age can di&s;po&s;e of his E&s;tate, much le&s;s &s;hould he have any &s;hare in the &s;upream Power of the Nation, to judge, vote, or di&s;po&s;e of the E&s;tate of the Realm. Yet the Practice in the Hou&s;e of Commons has often been otherwi&s;e; in the Hou&s;e of Lords, but &s;eldom.</P>
<P>Whoever &s;tands to be Elected mu&s;t be a Native Engli&s;hman, or at lea&s;t mu&s;t be Na|turalized by Act of Parliament. No Alien Denizated ought to &s;it here.</P>
<P>None of the Judges can be cho&s;en, that &s;it in the Bench, Common Pleas, or Exchequer, becau&s;e they are A&s;&s;i&s;tants in the Lords Hou&s;e, But any that have Judicial Places in other Courts Eccle&s;ia&s;tical or Civil, being no Lords of Parliament, are Eligible.</P>
<P>No Sheriff, nor Clergy-man can be cho&s;en a Member of Parliament. Not the fir&s;t, be|cau&s;e his per&s;onal Attendance is required with|in his Bayliwick, during the time of his Sheriffalty. Nor the la&s;t, becau&s;e he is of another Body, viz. the Convocation; and the Clergy of the Convocation-Hou&s;e are no Part or Member of the Parliament.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="342">
<P>A Man attainted of Trea&s;on or Felony, &amp;c. is not Eligible. For he ought to be <HI>magis ido|n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">us, di&s;cretus, &amp; &s;ufficiens.</HI> But a Per&s;on Outlawed in a Per&s;onal Cau&s;e may be a Bur|ge&s;s. And, tho the Common Law do's di&s;in|able the Party; yet the Priviledge of the Hou&s;e being urged prevails over the Law.</P>
<P>Anciently the Elected Members had a com|petent Allowance from the re&s;pective County, City, or Borough, for which they &s;erved in Parliament. A Knight of the Shire was al|lowed 4 &s;hill. and a Citizen or Burge&s;s 2 &s;hill. a Day; which in tho&s;e Days was a con&s;iderable Sum. But then the Se&s;&s;ions were but &s;hort, &s;ometimes but eight Days, &s;ometimes le&s;s, &s;eldom above three or four Weeks; and yet during that &s;hort &s;pace of time &s;everal great and weighty Affairs were di&s;patched. Which (as &s;ome think) were prepared to their hand by the King and Council, as it is now pra|cti&s;ed in Sweden by the 40 Coun&s;ellors of State, and in Scotland by the Lords of the Articles. And, if they did only debate upon &s;uch Things as the King did propo&s;e, a little Time might &s;erve well enough to do it. But it do's not appear to be &s;o by what pa&s;&s;ed Feb. 9. 1597, 39 Eliz. When the Queen gave her Royal A&s;&s;ent to 24 publick and 19 private Bills; but refu&s;ed 48 Bills more, which had pa&s;&s;ed both Hou&s;es. Certain it is, that there was le&s;s Canva&s;&s;ing, and more Plainne&s;s in tho&s;e Days, than there is at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The Place of Meeting for this honourable A&s;&s;embly is in what&s;oever City, Town, or Hou&s;e the King plea&s;es. But of latter times it has been ufually at the Kings ancient Palace at
<PB N="9" REF="342"><HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter;</HI> the Lords in a Room by them|&s;elves, and the Commons not far from them, in another Room, which formerly was S. Ste|phens Chappel.</P>
<P>When the Day prefixt by the King in his Writs of Summons is come, His Maje&s;ty u&s;ual|ly comes in per&s;on to the Hou&s;e of Lords, cloathed with his Royal Robes, the Crown up|on his head, and the Sword of State before Him. At the upper end of the Room is placed a Chair of State under a Canopy, upon which His Maje&s;ty &s;its.</P>
<P>Then all the Temporal Peers appear in their Scarlet Robes, every one according to his De|gree; and the Spiritual Lords, in their Epi&s;|copal Habit, which they do all the Se&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>On the Kings right hand, next the Wall, are placed on a Form the two <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hops;</HI> next below, on another Form, the Bi&s;hops of <HI>London, Durham,</HI> and <HI>Winche&s;ter;</HI> then, upon other Forms on the &s;ame &s;ide, all the re&s;t of the <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> &s;it, according to the priority of their Con&s;ecration.</P>
<P>The Lord Chancellor, or Keeper (when there is one) &s;tands behind the Cloth of State, or fits on the fir&s;t Wool-&s;ack, before the Chair of State, with his Great Seal and Mace by him.</P>
<P>On the Kings left hand are placed the Trea|&s;urer, Pre&s;ident of the Council, and Lord Privy Seal, of they be Barons, above all Dukes, but tho&s;e of the Royal Family; if not Barons, then they &s;it uppermo&s;t on the Wool-&s;acks. And on the &s;ame &s;ide &s;it the <HI>Dukes, Marque&s;&s;es,</HI> or <HI>Earls,</HI> according to their Creation. Cro&s;s the Hou&s;e, below the Wool-&s;acks, the fir&s;t Form is that which the <HI>Vi&s;counts</HI> &s;it upon; and, up|on the next Forms, the <HI>Barons,</HI> all in order.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="343">
<P>The King being thus &s;eated in his Throne, with this noble Appearance of the Peers of the Realm, all &s;tanding uncovered, his Maje&s;ty &s;ends for the Commons from their Room where they are a&s;&s;embled. Who being come (at lea&s;t part of them) &s;tand at the Bar of the Lords Hou&s;e. Whereupon the King makes a &s;hort Speech to both Hou&s;es, concerning &s;uch Matters as He thinks fit to lay before them for the Good of the Kingdom. Among&s;t which that of a Sup|ply of Mony is mo&s;t commonly one, in order to an&s;wer the extraordinary Charges of the Crown.</P>
<P>The King having ended his Speech, the Chancellor (or Lord Keeper) did formerly u&s;e by the Kings Appointment to inlarge upon it, with all the Rhetorick and Logick the Matter could bear, to di&s;po&s;e both Hou&s;es to a Com|pliance with the King. But His pre&s;ent Ma|je&s;ty has declined that Method, and being a Prince of few Words gains more upon ratio|nal Men by his conci&s;e and plain Way of De|livery, (as the more agreeable to a true gene|rous Nature) than perhaps he might with all the Windings and Turnings of artificial Rhe|torick.</P>
<P>Then the Speaker of the Hou&s;e of Lords commands, in the Kings Name, the Commons to a&s;&s;emble in their Hou&s;e, there to chu&s;e one of their Members for their Speaker, and to pre&s;ent him &s;uch a Day to His Maje&s;ty. Up|on which the King withdraws, and the Com|mons pre&s;ently re-a&s;&s;emble them&s;elves in the Lower Hou&s;e, in order to chu&s;e one of their Members for Speaker.</P>
<P>Sometimes, as in the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion, the Speaker is cho&s;en by the Kings Command, be|fore
<PB N="11" REF="343">fore His Maje&s;ty delivers his Speech to both Hou&s;es of Parliament.</P>
<P>After the Speaker is cho&s;en, and the Choice approved by the King, His Maje&s;ty leaves both Hou&s;es to their private Debates upon the Sub|ject of his Speech; and do's no more appear among&s;t them that Se&s;&s;ion in his Royal Robes, except upon the pa&s;&s;ing of any Act, or at the Clo&s;e of the Se&s;&s;ion, whether it be by Adjourn|ment, Prorogation, or Di&s;&s;olution. 'Tis true, upon any extraordinary Debate in the Hou&s;e of Lords, 'tis cu&s;tomary with the Kings of England to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the &s;ame; not to argue upon it, or to influence the Hou&s;e one way or other, but only to hear the Arguments of the Hou&s;e upon the Matter in Debate. But then the King appears without his Crown and Robes, and every Peer &s;its (except when he &s;peaks to the Hou&s;e) as if the King were not there.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hou&s;e of Lords,</HI> otherwi&s;e called the <HI>Hou&s;e of Peers,</HI> or the <HI>&V;pper Hou&s;e,</HI> con&s;i&s;ts of 189 Members. Viz. 163 Temporal Lords, whereof 14 <HI>Dukes,</HI> 3 <HI>Marque&s;&s;es,</HI> 72 <HI>Earls,</HI> 9 <HI>Vi&s;counts,</HI> 65 <HI>Barons;</HI> and 26 Spiritual Lords, whereof 2 <HI>Arch-bi&s;hops,</HI> and 24 <HI>Bi&s;hops.</HI></P>
<P>But the King may, by virtue of his Prero|gative, increa&s;e the Number of the Peers to &s;it and vote in their Hou&s;e, as Barons, by &s;end|ing his Writs for that pupo&s;e to whom&s;oever His Maje&s;ty thinks fit for that Service.</P>
<P>The Lord Chancellor, or Lord Keeper (when there is one) is of cour&s;e the Speaker of this Hou&s;e. Otherwi&s;e they may appoint any of their own Members, or el&s;e one of the Judges, for that Place; as in the Ca&s;e of their late Speaker, the Right Honourable the Marquis of
<PB N="12" REF="344"><HI>Hallifax,</HI> and that of Sir Robert <HI>Atkins,</HI> Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer, the pre&s;ent Speaker of the Hou&s;e of Lords.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the fir&s;t Wool-&s;ack, which is the u&s;ual Seat for the Lord Chancellor or Lord Keeper, there are other Wool-&s;acks; Upon which the <HI>Judges,</HI> the Kings <HI>Council at Law,</HI> and the <HI>Ma&s;ters of Chancery</HI> (not being Ba|rons) &s;it, not to give their Suffrage, but only their Advice, when required thereto. The U&s;e of which <HI>Wool-&s;acks</HI> is probably to put them in mind of the great Advantages the Eng|li&s;h Wool has brought to this Nation, &s;o that it may never be neglected.</P>
<P>On the lowermo&s;t Wool &s;ack are placed the <HI>Clerk of the Crown,</HI> and <HI>Clerk of the Parliament;</HI> The fir&s;t being concerned in all Writs of and Pardons in Parliament, and the other in keep|ing the Records of all Things pa&s;&s;ed therein. Under this there are two <HI>Clerks,</HI> who kneeling behind the Wool-&s;ack write upon it.</P>
<P>Without the Bar of the Hou&s;e &s;its the <HI>Black Rod,</HI> &s;o called from a black Stick he carries in his hand, who is (as it were) the Me&s;&s;enger of this Hou&s;e. For he is imploy'd, among&s;t other Things, to call for the Hou&s;e of Com|mons to the Hou&s;e of Lords upon His Maje&s;ties Command; and to his Cu&s;tody are Commit|ted all &s;uch Peers as the Hou&s;e things fit to Commit upon any Tre&s;pa&s;s. Under him is a <HI>Yeoman &V;&s;her</HI> that waits at the Door within, a <HI>Crier</HI> without, and a <HI>Sergeant at Mace</HI> always attending the Speaker.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hou&s;e of Commons,</HI> otherwi&s;e called the <HI>Lower hou&s;e,</HI> is by much the greater Body of the two. For, as England con&s;i&s;ts of 40 Counties, in which there are 25 Cities, 8 Cinque-Ports,
<PB N="13" REF="344">
2 Univer&s;ities, and 168 Borough-Towns, all which are Priviledged to &s;end Members to Par|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ament, if we reckon two Members from each, the Whole amounts to 486 Members. To which adding 24 from Wales, the Whole is 510.</P>
<P>'Tis true, there are three Boroughs in Eng|land, each of which &s;ends but one Member; viz. <HI>Abington</HI> in Oxford&s;hire, <HI>Higham-Ferrers</HI> in Northampton&s;hire, and <HI>Bewdley</HI> in Wor|ce&s;ter&s;hire. But the&s;e three, wanting of the Number, are made up by the City of <HI>London,</HI> which &s;ends four Members; and by the City of <HI>Bath,</HI> which &s;ends three.</P>
<P>Of all this great Number, many are u&s;ually ab&s;ent, upon Bu&s;ine&s;s, or Sickne&s;s, &amp;c. So that, if they be three hundred met together, 'tis counted a pretty full Hou&s;e. And, if they be but forty Members in all, they make a hou&s;e.</P>
<P>This Hou&s;e, repre&s;enting the whole Com|mons of the Realm, do's generally con&s;i&s;t of the Flower of the Gentry; &s;ome of them Noblemens Sons, Privy Coun&s;ellors, Courtiers, Men learned in the Law, Officers and Com|manders, Merchants, &amp;c. but mo&s;t of them Gentlemen of good E&s;tates, with the advan|tage of a liberal and genteel Education.

<PB N="14" REF="345">the Clerk of the Hou&s;e &s;itting near him at the Table. But none wears a Robe but the Speaker, except (as I hinted before) the Members of Parliament for the City of London, who at their fir&s;t Meeting appear in their Scarlet Robes. Every Member wears what he fancies mo&s;t, and &s;o do the Temporal Lords in their Hou&s;e, on all Days when the King comes not thither in State. To Strangers, I confe&s;s, it looks &s;omething odd, that &s;o augu&s;t an A&s;&s;em|bly, ve&s;ted with a Legi&s;lative Power, and met together for the Exerci&s;e of the &s;ame, &s;hould have no proper Garb for &s;o great a Council, but appear in their u&s;ual Dre&s;s. But Cu&s;tom has &s;o far prevailed again&s;t the Inconveniencies that attend tho&s;e Formalities, (which the Engli&s;h Ne|bility and Gentry are generally aver&s;e from) that they are not like to be ever ballanced by the Re&s;pect and Veneration that might be gained, as in forein Countries, by the &s;mall trouble of them.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual Time for the Meeting of each Hou&s;e is in the Forenoon, from eight or nine a clock till twelve or one; except Sundays, high Fe&s;tivals, and Fa&s;t-Days.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things being premi&s;ed, my next Bu|&s;ine&s;s is to &s;peak about the Choice of the <HI>Speaker</HI> of the Hou&s;e of Commons; Who is the Mouth of the Hou&s;e, and &s;o nece&s;&s;ary a Part thereof, that they can do no Bu&s;ine&s;s with|out him. For 'tis the Speakers Part to &s;ee the Orders of the Hou&s;e ob&s;erved, to &s;tate the Bills that are brought in, to collect the Sub|&s;tance of the Debates, and the Sen&s;e of the Hou&s;e upon them.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="345">
<P>The fit&s;t Day each Member is called by his Name, every one an&s;wering for what Place he &s;erveth. That done, a Motion is made to chu&s;e their Speaker; who ought to be a Per|&s;on of great Ability, and is u&s;ually one of the long Robe. And, to avoid all Delays, the Choice is commonly &s;uch as the King approves of.</P>
<P>This Choice is made by the Plurality of Votes. Upon which the Party cho&s;en de&s;ires (according to ancient Cu&s;tom) to be excu&s;ed from &s;o weighty an Office, and prays the Hou&s;e to proceed to a new Election. But he is commonly an&s;wered with a full Con&s;ent of Voices upon his Name. And then two of the principal Members go to him, and lead him from his Place to the Speakers Chair; where being &s;et, they return to their Places.</P>
<P>Then the Speaker ri&s;es, and makes a &s;hort Speech to the Hou&s;e, con&s;i&s;ting of his humble Thanks for their good Opinion of him, with Promi&s;es of his be&s;t Indeavours for their Ser|vice.</P>
<P>At the Day appointed for his Pre&s;entation to the King (which is u&s;ually the next Day) His Maje&s;ty being come to the Hou&s;e of Lords in his Royal Robes, and the Lords al&s;o in their Robes, the Commons are called in. Who be|ing come, the <HI>Speaker</HI> is brought between two of them, with low Obey&s;ance to the Bar, and &s;o pre&s;ented at the Bar to His Maje&s;ty; where he makes likewi&s;e a mode&s;t Refu&s;al. But the King approving the Commons Choice, and not allowing of his Excu&s;e, the <HI>Speaker</HI> nakes an Oration to His Maje&s;ty; the Matter whereof is left to his own Thoughts, having <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o Direction about it from the Commons. But it u&s;ually ends with the&s;e three Petitions.
<PB N="16" REF="346">Fir&s;t, that the Commons may have, during their Sitting, <HI>a free Ace&s;s to His Maje&s;ty;</HI> Se|condly, <HI>Freedom of Speech in their Hou&s;e;</HI> And thirdly, <HI>Freedom from Arre&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>Which humble and mode&s;t Way of the Peoples addre&s;&s;ing to the King, for His Maje|&s;ties A&s;&s;ent to their ancient Priviledges, is be|coming the Reverence due to the Maje&s;ty of the Prince. But it is no Argument (as &s;ome would have it) that either the Laws there|upon made, or the Priviledges &s;o allowed, are precarious, and may be refu&s;ed them.</P>
<P>The Speakers Oration being an&s;wered in the Kings Name, by the Speaker of the Hou&s;e of Lords, and his Petitions allowed, he with the Commons departs to the Lower Hou&s;e. And then is the fir&s;t time that the Mace is carried before him. Being come to the Chair, he makes a &s;hort Speech to the Hou&s;e to this effect, That, <HI>Whereas they have been plea&s;ed to chu&s;e him for their Speaker, he hopes they will a&s;&s;i&s;t him in that Station, and favourably accept hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;incere Proceedings for their Service.</HI></P>
<P>That done, the Cu&s;tom is to read, for that Time, only one Bill left unpa&s;t the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ions to give him Sei&s;in (as it were) of his Place.</P>
<P>In the Lords Hou&s;e 'tis ob&s;ervable, that, when the King is ab&s;ent, the Lords at their en|trance do reverence to the Chair of State, as is (or &s;hould be) done by all that come into the Kings Prefence-Chamber.</P>
<P>And then the Judges, when called in upon any Point of Law, may &s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> but may not be Covered, till the Speaker &s;ignify unto the them Leave of the Lords. The Kings Coun|cil and Ma&s;ters of Chancery &s;it al&s;o, but may

<P>But, we have dwelt long enough upon the Preliminaries (if I may &s;ay &s;o) of a Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament; and 'tis time to &s;hew their Proceedings, the manner of their Debates, and Pa&s;&s;ing of Bills and Acts, which is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hus.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Care is taken in each Hou&s;e to Vote <HI>Thanks</HI> to his Maje&s;ty for his Gracious Speech. Then they appoint their &s;tanding Committees, of which more afterwards. And, to di&s;cover what Members are ab&s;ent without ju&s;t Cau&s;e or leave of the Hou&s;e, the Hou&s;e is called from time to time thus. Every Member who&s;e Name is called over, uncovers his Head, and &s;tands up at the mention of his Name. If he be ab|&s;ent, he is either excu&s;ed and entred according|ly; or, if none excu&s;e him, he is entred <HI>De|fieit.</HI> Such as are pre&s;ent are marked; and the Defaulters called over again the &s;ame Day, or the Day after, &s;ometimes &s;ummoned and &s;ometimes &s;ent for by the Sergeant.</P>

<P>As they are be&s;t acquainted with the State of the Nation, and the publick Grievances, the&s;e often do take place. If any Laws are fit to be Abrogated, and new ones Made, this is a proper Subject for them to go upon. And, whil&s;t they mind the Welfare of the Na|tion, 'tis to be &s;uppo&s;ed they mind that of the King.</P>
<P>In order to which, any Member of the Hou&s;e may offer a <HI>Bill</HI> for the publick Good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> except it be for Impo&s;ing a Tax, which is not to be done but by Order of the Hou&s;e fir&s;t had. And he that tenders the Bill mu&s;t fir&s;t open the Matter of it to the Hou&s;e, and offer the Rea&s;ons for admitting thereof; upon which the Hou&s;e will either admit, or deny it.</P>
<P>But, if any member de&s;ire, that an Act made, and in force, may be Repealed or Al|tered, he is fir&s;t to move the Hou&s;e in it, and have their Re&s;olution, before any Bill to that purpo&s;e may be offered. If the Hou&s;e &s;hall think it fit, upon the Rea&s;ons alledged, their u&s;ual Way is to appoint one or more of the Members to bring in a Bill for that pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>A private Bill, that concerns any particular Per|&s;on, is not to be offered to the Hou&s;e, till the Leave of the Hou&s;e be de&s;ired, and the &s;ub|&s;tance of &s;uch Bill made Known, either by Mo|tion or Petition.</P>
<P>Petitions are u&s;ually pre&s;cribed by Members of the &s;ame County the Petitioners are of. If they be concerning private Per&s;ons, they are to be &s;ub&s;cribed, and the Per&s;ons pre&s;enting them called in to the Bar, to avow the &s;ub|&s;tance of the Petition, e&s;pecially if it be a Com|plaint again&s;t any.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="347">
<P>The preferring of Bills, either to be Read or Pa&s;&s;ed, ly's much in the Speaker's Power. For, though he be earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed by the Hou&s;e for the Reading of &s;ome one Bill; yet, if he have not had convenient time to Read the &s;ame over, and to make a Breviate thereof for his own Memory, he may claim a Priviledge to defer the Reading thereof to &s;ome other time. Formerly the Speaker had liberty to call for a trivate Bill, to be Read every Morning.</P>
<P>The Clerk of the Hou&s;e is u&s;ually directed by the Speaker, and &s;ometimes by the Hou&s;e, what Bill to read, who with a loud and di|&s;tinct Voice fir&s;t reads the Title of the Bill; and, after a little Paw&s;e, the Bill it &s;elf. Which done, Ki&s;&s;ing his hand, he delivers the &s;ame to the Speaker. Then the Speaker &s;tands up un|covered, whereas otherwi&s;e he &s;its with his Hat on; and holding the Bill in his hand &s;ays, <HI>This Bill is thus Intituled,</HI> and then reads the Title. Whereupon he opens to the Hou&s;e the &s;ub&s;tance of the Bill; which he does, either by tru&s;ting to his Memory, or with the help of a Breviate, filed to the Bill.</P>
<P>The effect of the Bill being thus opened, he declares to the Hou&s;e, <HI>that it is the fir&s;t Read|ing of the Bill,</HI> and delivers it again to the Clerk. For every Bill is to be Read three times, before it can be made an Act. Except a Bill of Indemnity coming from the King, which has but one Reading in each Hou&s;e, becau&s;e the Subject ought to take it as the King will give it. The &s;ame it is with a Bill of Sub&s;idies granted by the Clergy.</P>
<P>At the fir&s;t Read<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of the Bill 'tis not u&s;ual with the Hou&s;e to &s;peak to it, or put it to the Que&s;tion; but rather to take time till the &s;e|cond Reading, in order to con&s;ider of it in the
<PB N="20" REF="348">mean while. Nor to move for any Addition to it, which were to imply, that the Body of the Bill is good, before it comes to a regular Trial upon the Second Reading.</P>
<P>But, if any Bill originally begun in the Lower Hou&s;e happen, upon the fir&s;t Reading to be debated to and fro, and that upon the De|bate the Hou&s;e do call for the Que&s;tion; the Que&s;tion ought to be, not <HI>Whether the Bill &s;hall be read the &s;econd time</HI> (which is the ordi|nary Cour&s;e,) but <HI>Whether it &s;hall be Rejected</HI> Whereas to a Bill coming from the Lords &s;o much favour and re&s;pect is &s;hewn, that if, up|on the fir&s;t Reading, it be &s;poken again&s;t, and pre&s;&s;ed to be put to the Que&s;tion, the Speak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> does not make it for Rejection, as in the fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|mer Ca&s;e, but for the Second Reading; and if that be denied, then for Rejection.

<P>When the Que&s;tion for Rejection is made, and the greater Voice is to have the Bill Reject|ed, the Clerk ought to &s;et it down <HI>Rejected</HI> in the Journal, and &s;o to Indor&s;e it on the back of the Bill; and it &s;hall be no more Read that Se&s;|&s;ion. But, if it be altered in any Point mare|rial, both in the Body and the Title, it may be revived and received a &s;econd time. If the Voice be to have the Bill Retained, then it &s;hall have his &s;econd Reading in Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>'Tis unu&s;ual for one and the &s;ame Bill to be Read twice in one Day, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">le&s;s there be &s;pecial Rea&s;ons for it. Yet it has been done &s;ome|times, for want of other Bu&s;ine&s;s, when the Bill was not of any great Con&s;equence; but

<P>Though a Bill may be &s;econdly Read the next Day after the fir&s;t Reading, yet the u&s;ual Cour&s;e is to forbear for two or three Days, that Men may have more time to con&s;ider upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t; except the Bu&s;ine&s;s requires ha&s;te.</P>
<P>After the Bill is &s;econdly read, the Clerk, as before, in humble manner, delivers it to the Speaker; who reads again the Title and his Breviate, as he did upon the fir&s;t Reading. Up|on which he paw&s;es a while, till &s;ome Member or other of the Hou&s;e do &s;peak to it. For then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd not before, is the time when to &s;peak.

<P>After every Speech is ended, the Speaker ought to &s;tay a while, before he make the Que|&s;tion for the Committing thereof, to &s;ee whe|ther any Man will &s;peak thereto. And, when he perceives the Debate is at an end, he directs the Hou&s;e in the&s;e Words; <HI>As many as are of Opinion, that this Bill &s;hall be Committed, &s;ay Yea.</HI> And, after the Affirmative Voice given he proceeds thus to the Negative, <HI>As many as are of the contrary Opinion, &s;ay No.</HI> The Speak|er ought by his Ear to judge which of the Voi|ces is the greate&s;t; but, if the Thing be doubt|ful, the Hou&s;e does Divide upon it. And, if upon Divi&s;ion of the Hou&s;e, it appear that the Numbers are equal, the Speaker has the ca&s;ting Voice upon all Que&s;tions.</P>
<P>If the Affirmative Voice be the greater, he ought to put the Hou&s;e in mind about Naming of the <HI>Committees,</HI> which is thus. Any Mem|ber of the Hou&s;e may be named to be one of the Committee; and the Clerk ought in his Journal to write under the Title of the Bill the Name of every one called for that purpo&s;e, at lea&s;t of &s;uch who&s;e Names in that Confu&s;ion he can di&s;tinctly hear. And this he ought to do without Partiality, either to tho&s;e that name, or to the Party named. But he that has directly &s;poken again&s;t the Body of the Bill may no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be named to be of the Committee; it being &s;uppo&s;ed, that he who is again&s;t the Bill is no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a proper Per&s;on to be imployed for the amend|ing (or improving) of it.</P>

<P>When a Bill &s;ent from the Lords is twice Read, the Que&s;tion ought to be for the Com|mitment. If it be denied, it ought to be Read the third time; and the next Que&s;tion, not for the Ingro&s;&s;ing, as when the Bill begun in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ower Hou&s;e, but for the Pa&s;&s;ing of the Bill.

<P>As to the &s;ubject Matter of the Debates, the Speaker is not to argue for, or again&s;t any &s;ide; but only to hear the Arguments of the Hou&s;e, and (as I &s;aid before) to collect the &s;ub&s;tance of them. Neither has he any Voice, but the Ca&s;ting Voice.</P>
<P>Whoever &s;peaks to a Bill ought to &s;tand up Uncovered, and direct his Speech to the Speaker. If two ri&s;e at the &s;ame time, and fall &s;peaking together, the Speaker has power to determine which &s;hall give way to the other. He that &s;peaks is to be heard out, and not interrupted, unle&s;s by Mr. Speaker; which he may do in &s;ome Ca&s;es, as when the Di&s;cour&s;e &s;pins out to too great a length, or is from the Matter in hand, &amp;c.</P>
<P>None ought to &s;peak twice to a Bill in one Day, unle&s;s &s;ometimes by way of Explication. But, if the Bill be oftner Read than once, a Man may &s;peak as often as the Bill is read.
<PB N="24" REF="350">And, if any Thing be done contrary to the Orders of the Hou&s;e, one may ri&s;e up and &s;peak to it in the mid&s;t of a Debate, in ca&s;e the Speaker do not.

But whoever ri&s;es up to &s;peak to the Orders of the Hou&s;e in the mid&s;t of a Debate mu&s;t keep within that Line, and not fall to the Matter it &s;elf. If he do, he may be taken down by the Speaker, or any other Member, calling to the Orders of the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>No Member in his Di&s;cour&s;e is to mention the Name of any other then pre&s;ent, but to de&s;cribe him by his Title or Addition, as <HI>that Noble Lord, that Worthy Knight.</HI> Or by his Of|fice, as <HI>Judge, Sergeant, Gentleman of the long, or &s;hort Robe.</HI> Or by his Place, as <HI>the Gentle|man near the Chair, near the Bar, on the other &s;ide;</HI> or <HI>that Gentleman that &s;pake la&s;t, or la&s;t &s;ave one,</HI> or the like.</P>
<P>No reviling, or reflecting Expre&s;&s;ions mu&s;t be u&s;ed. And, though freedom of Speech and Debates be an undoubted Priviledge of the Hou&s;e, yet what&s;oever is &s;poken in the Hou&s;e is &s;ubject to the Cen&s;ure of the Hou&s;e. But, if any &s;peak irreverently or &s;editiou&s;ly again&s;t the Prince or the Privy Council, he is not only Interrupted, but &s;ometimes &s;ent to the Tower.</P>
<P>After the Debate is ended, the Speaker ought to put the Que&s;tion for Ingro&s;&s;ing. If the Plu|rality of Voices be again&s;t it, the Clerk ought to make an Entry in his Journal, that the &s;ame was Da&s;hed, and to make a Note of it upon the back of the Bill, and the Day when. If for
<PB N="25" REF="350">it, he mu&s;t make his Entry and Note accor|dingly.</P>
<P>A Bill that has been Committed, and is Re|ported, ought not in an ordinary Cour&s;e to be Recommitted, but either Da&s;hed or Ingro&s;&s;ed. Yet, when the Matter is of Importance, it is &s;ometimes Recommitted, and commonly to the &s;ame Committee.</P>
<P>Some few Days after the Bill has been order|ed to be Ingro&s;&s;ed, the &s;ame being accordingly Ingro&s;&s;ed, is offered by the Speaker to be Read the third time, for the Pa&s;&s;ing thereof. And, to prevent carrying of Bills with a few Voi|ces, it has &s;ometimes been ordered, that no Bills &s;hould be put to the Pa&s;&s;ing until Nine of the Clock; at which time the Hou&s;e is com|monly full, or &s;hortly after.</P>
<P>But 'tis Ob&s;ervable, that the Speaker &s;eldom puts any one Bill to the Pa&s;&s;ing by it &s;elf alone; for he commonly &s;tays, till there be divers Bills ready Ingro&s;&s;ed for the third Reading. And, when he has a convenient Number, (as four, or five) he gives Notice to the Hou&s;e, that <HI>he pur|po&s;eth next Day to offer up &s;ome Bills for the Pa&s;|&s;ing, and de&s;ireth the Hou&s;e to give &s;pecial At|tendance for that purpo&s;e.</HI> Accordingly the Day following, he puts 'em to the third Reading; fir&s;t private Bills, till the Hou&s;e be pretty full, and then the publick ones Ingro&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>A Bill being Read the third time by the Clerk of the Hou&s;e, he delivers it to the Speak|er; who (as before) Reads the Title, explains the Nature of the Bill, and then tells the Hou&s;e that it has now been Read thrice, and that with their Favours he will put it to the Pa&s;&s;ing. But, before he does it, he pau&s;eth a while, that the Members may have liberty to &s;peak thereto. For, upon the third Reading, the Matter comes
<PB N="26" REF="351">to a fre&s;h Debate, and for the mo&s;t part it is more &s;poken unto at this time, than upon any of the former Readings. But then 'tis very rare to have it Recommitted, unle&s;s it be for &s;ome particular Clau&s;e or Provi&s;o.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, the Debate being over, (the Speaker &s;till holding the Bill in his hand) puts it to the Pa&s;&s;ing thus; <HI>As many as are of Opinion that this Bill &s;hould pa&s;s, &s;ay Yea.</HI> And after the Af|firmative Voice given, he proceeds thus to the Negative, <HI>As many as are of the contrary Opi|nion, &s;ay No.</HI> Whereupon the Speaker is to de|clare his Opinion, whether the <HI>Yea's</HI> or the <HI>No</HI>'s have it; and his Opinion is to &s;tand at the Judgement of the Hou&s;e, unle&s;s the Ca&s;e be doubtful, and a Motion be made for the Divi|ding of the Hou&s;e. Then the Que&s;tion is put, whether the <HI>Yea</HI>'s or <HI>No</HI>'s are to go out of the Hou&s;e. Which commonly falls out to be the Lot of the <HI>Yea's,</HI> e&s;pecially upon a new Bill; for it &s;eems but rea&s;onable, that tho&s;e &s;hould &s;it &s;till who are for the old Law, becau&s;e they are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. To count the Hou&s;e, the Speaker does nominate two of the <HI>Yea's,</HI> and two of the <HI>No's.</HI> Who, having each a Staff in his Hand, are to count the Members that re|main &s;itting in the Hou&s;e; and then to &s;tand within the Door, two on each &s;ide, and count the Number of them who went forth, as they come in.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e being thus told, the two Tellers that have the mo&s;t Votes, &s;tanding at the Bar on the right hand of the two others (the re&s;t being all &s;et in their places) make their ap|proaches together to the Table, with the u&s;ual Obey&s;ance to the Hou&s;e. He that &s;tands on the right hand declares to the Speaker the Num|ber
<PB N="27" REF="351">of the <HI>Yea's</HI> and <HI>No's.</HI> That done, they all depart, with like Reverence into their Places; and Mr. Speaker makes the Report to the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>If it be carried in the Affirmative, the Clerk is to enter the Vote, <HI>Re&s;olved.</HI> If in the Ne|gative, thus; <HI>The Que&s;tion being put</HI> (then he &s;ets down the Words of the Que&s;tion) <HI>it pa&s;&s;ed in the Negative.</HI></P>
<P>While the Hou&s;e is divided, or dividing in order to gather the Voices, no Member is to &s;peak, or to remove out of his Place, except &s;uch as go forth upon the Divi&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Bill being thus pa&s;&s;ed, the Clerk (if the Bill be originally exhibited in the Hou&s;e of Commons) ought to write within the Bill on the top toward the right hand, <HI>Soit baille aux Seigneurs,</HI> that is, Let it be &s;ent up to the Lords. But, if the Bill pa&s;&s;ed be originally be|gun in the Lords Hou&s;e, then ought the Clerk to write underneath the Sub&s;cription of the Lords (which always is at the foot of the Bill) <HI>Ace Bill les Communes ont a&s;&s;enti.</HI></P>
<P>And, when the Speaker has in his hands a convenient Number of Bills ready pa&s;&s;ed, he then puts the Hou&s;e in mind of &s;ending them up to the Lords, and de&s;ires the Hou&s;e to ap|point the Me&s;&s;engers. Among&s;t which a prin|cipal Member of the Hou&s;e is appointed for that purpo&s;e, to whom the Bills are delivered in &s;uch Order as he is to pre&s;ent them to the Lords, by the Direction of the Speaker, except the Hou&s;e be plea&s;ed to give &s;pecial Direction therein.</P>
<P>This principal Me&s;&s;enger, coming in the fir&s;t Rank of his Company (u&s;ually con&s;i&s;ting of 30 or 40 Members) to the Bar of the Lords Hou&s;e,
<PB N="28" REF="352">with three Congies, the Lords ri&s;e from their Places, and come down to meet them at the Bar. Then the chief Me&s;&s;enger tells them, that the Knights, Citizens, and Burge&s;&s;es of the Hou&s;e of Commons have &s;ent unto their Lord|&s;hips certain Bills. Whereupon he reads the Title of every Bill, as it lies in order; and de|livers the &s;ame in an humble manner to the Speaker of the Hou&s;e of Lords, who is come down of purpo&s;e to receive them.</P>
<P>But, when any An&s;wer is to be delivered by the Speaker of this Hou&s;e, in the name and be|half of the whole Hou&s;e, to &s;uch Knights and Burge&s;&s;es as come from the Commons, the Lords are to keep their Places, and the Speaker is to deliver their An&s;wer with his Head co|vered, whil&s;t the Knights and Burge&s;&s;es &s;tand uncovered toward the lower end of the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>In this Hou&s;e the Lords give their Voices, beginning at the <HI>Pui&s;ne,</HI> or lowe&s;t Baron, and &s;o the re&s;t <HI>Seriatim,</HI> every one an&s;wering apart, <HI>Content,</HI> or <HI>Not Content;</HI> fir&s;t for him&s;elf, and then &s;everally for &s;o many as he hath Letters and Proxies.</P>
<P>For any Peer of the Realm, by Licen&s;e of the King upon ju&s;t Cau&s;e to ab&s;ent, may make a Proxy, that is, may con&s;titute another Lord to give his Voice in the Upper Hou&s;e, when any Difference of Opinion, and Divi&s;ion of the Hou&s;e &s;hall happen. Otherwi&s;e, if no &s;uch Divi&s;ion fall out, it never comes to be que|&s;tioned or Known to whom &s;uch Proxies are directed.</P>
<P>By an Order of this Hou&s;e in the Reign of Charles I, it was Ordered, that no Peer &s;hould be capable of receiving above two Proxies,
<PB N="29" REF="352">or more to be numbred in any Cau&s;e vo|ted.</P>
<P>If a Bill pa&s;&s;ed in one Hou&s;e, and being &s;ent to the other, this demur upon it, then a <HI>Conference</HI> is demanded in the Painted Chamber. Where the deputed Members of each Hou&s;e meet, the Lords &s;itting cover|ed at a Table, and the Commons &s;tanding bare with great re&s;pect. There the Bu&s;ine&s;s is debated; and if they cannot agree, it is nul|led.</P>
<P>When Bills are pa&s;&s;ed by both Hou&s;es, upon three &s;everal Readings in either Hou&s;e, before they can have the force of Law, they mu&s;t have the <HI>Royal A&s;&s;ent,</HI> which puts life into them. For, as there is no Act of Parliament but mu&s;t have the Con&s;ent of the Lords and Commons, and the Royal A&s;&s;ent of the King; &s;o what&s;oever pa&s;&s;eth in Parliament by this threefold Con&s;ent, hath the force of an Act of Parliament.</P>
<P>The Royal A&s;&s;ent, which u&s;ed formerly to be deferred till the la&s;t Day of the Se&s;&s;ion, is given after this manner, whenever the King thinks fit. His Maje&s;ty then comes into the Hou&s;e of Peers, with his Crown on his Head, and cloathed with his Royal Robes. Being &s;eat|ed in his Chair of State, and all the Lords in their Robes, the Hou&s;e of Commons is &s;ent for up (as before) by the Black Rod. Thus the King, Lords, and Commons being met, the Clerk of the Crown reads the Title of each Bill, and after the Reading of every Title, the Clerk of the Parliament pronounces the Royal A&s;&s;ent, according to his In&s;tructions from the King. If it be a publick Bill, to which the
<PB N="30" REF="353">King a&s;&s;enteth, the Words are <HI>le Roy le veut,</HI> the King wills it. Whereas to a publick Bill which the King forbears to allow, the An&s;wer is, <HI>Le Roy S'avi&s;era,</HI> the King will con&s;ider; which is look'd upon as a civil Denial. To a Sub&s;idy-Bill, <HI>le Roy remercie &s;es loyaux Sujets, accepte leur Benevolence, &amp; au&s;&s;i le veut,</HI> the King thanks his loyal Subjects, accepts their Be|nevolence, and &s;o wills it. And to a private Bill allowed by the King, <HI>Soit fait comme il e&s;t de&s;ire,</HI> be it done as it is de&s;ired.</P>
<P>But, in ca&s;e of a General Pardon, as it is the King's Gift, &s;o the Return is from the Lords and Commons to His Maje&s;ty in the&s;e Words, <HI>los Prelats, Seigneurs, &amp; Communes en ce Parle|ment a&s;&s;emblez, au nom de tous vos autres Sujets, remercient tres humblement Votre Maje&s;te, &amp; pri|ent Dieu qu'il vous donne bonne &amp; longue Vie en Sante,</HI> the Prelates, Lords, and Commons in this Parliament a&s;&s;embled in the Name of all Your other Subjects, do mo&s;t humbly thank your Maje&s;ty, and pray God to give You a good and long Life in Health.</P>
<P>'Tis ob&s;ervable in the mean while, how we have retained about making of Laws, &s;o many French Expre&s;&s;ions, derived to us doubtle&s;s from the Normans.</P>
<P>The U&s;e of <HI>Committees</HI> is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for the Di&s;patch of Parliament Bu&s;ine&s;s, and their Way of managing Bills &s;o fair and honourable, that it will be proper to add &s;omething to what has been &s;aid before concerning them.</P>
<P>They con&s;i&s;t of &s;uch Members as each Hou&s;e chu&s;es from among them, to make a &s;trict Exa|mination of the Bills, and therein &s;uch A|mendments and Alterations as their Rea|&s;on will dictate upon a full Debate among
<PB N="31" REF="353">them&s;elves, and to Report the &s;ame to the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Now there are three &s;orts of <HI>Committees,</HI> viz. <HI>Standing, Select,</HI> and <HI>Grand Committees.</HI></P>
<P>There are in the Hou&s;e of Commons five <HI>Standing Committees</HI> u&s;ually appointed in the beginning of the Parliament, and remaining du|ring all the Se&s;&s;ion. Viz. One for <HI>Priviledges and Elections,</HI> another for <HI>Religion,</HI> a third for <HI>Grie|vances,</HI> another for <HI>Courts of Ju&s;tice,</HI> and the fifth for <HI>Trade.</HI></P>
<P>Among&s;t which the <HI>Committee for Privi|ledges and Elections</HI> has always had the Prece|dence, being commonly the fir&s;t Committee ap|pointed, either the &s;ame Day the Speaker did take his Place, or the next day after. Their Power was anciently to examine, and make Re|port of all Ca&s;es touching Elections and Re|turns, and all Ca&s;es for Priviledge as might fall out during the Parliament. But that Power has been &s;ince abridged, e&s;pecially in Matters of Priviledge; which are heard in the Hou&s;e, and not in a Committee, unle&s;s in &s;ome &s;pe|cial Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>By a <HI>Select Committee,</HI> I mean a Committee particularly cho&s;en to inquire into a Bill. In the Choice whereof this Rule is ob&s;erved in the Hou&s;e, that they who have given their Voice again&s;t the Body of a Bill, cannot be of the Com|mittee. And, though any Member of the Hou&s;e may be pre&s;ent at any &s;elect Committee, yet he is not to give any Vote there, unle&s;s he be na|med to be of the Committee. As to their Number, they are &s;eldom le&s;s than eight, but have been &s;ometimes many more, and com|monly Men well ver&s;ed in Parliament Bu&s;i|ne&s;s.</P>
<PB N="32" REF="354">
<P>Upon the fir&s;t Meeting of a Committee in their Committee Chamber, they chu&s;e among them a <HI>Chair-man,</HI> who is much like the Speak|er in the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>After any Bill is Committed upon the &s;econd Reading, it may be delivered indifferently to any of the Committee. Who are fir&s;t to read it, and then to con&s;ider the &s;ame by Parts. If there be any Preamble, 'tis u&s;ually con&s;idered after the other Parts of the Bill. The Rea&s;on is, be|cau&s;e upon Con&s;ideration of the body of the Bill &s;uch Alterations may therein be made, as may al&s;o occa&s;ion the Alteration of the Pream|ble, which is be&s;t done la&s;t</P>
<P>The Committee may not raze, interline, or blot the Bill it &s;elf; but mu&s;t in a Paper by it &s;elf &s;et down the Amendments. Which ought to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oe done by &s;etting down in the Paper the Number of the Folio where the Amendment is made, naming the Place particularly where the Words of the Amendment are to be In&s;erted, or tho&s;e of the Bill Omitted. The Breviat al&s;o annexed to the Bill mu&s;t be amended ac|cordingly, and made to agree with the Bill.</P>
<P>When all the Amendments are perfected, e|very one being Voted &s;ingly, all of them are to be read at the Committee, and put to the Que&s;tion, <HI>Whether the &s;ame &s;hall be Reported to the Hou&s;e.</HI> But, when the Vote is to be put, any Member of the Committee may move to add to tho&s;e Amendments, or to Amend any o|ther part of the Bill.</P>
<P>If the Vote of the Committee pa&s;s in the Af|firmative, then commonly the Chair-man is appointed to make the Report. Which being done, that Committee is di&s;&s;olved, and can act no more without a new Power.</P>
<PB N="33" REF="354">
<P>The u&s;ual Time for the Hou&s;e to receive the Reports is, after the Hou&s;e is full. And 'tis commonly the fir&s;t Thing they go then upon; unle&s;s there be Bills Ingro&s;&s;ed, which are to take place, and publick Bills before pri|vate.</P>
<P>The Reporter mu&s;t fir&s;t acquaint the Hou&s;e, That he is to make a Report from &s;uch a Com|mittee, to whom &s;uch a Bill was Committed. Then &s;tanding in his place, he reads each of the Amendments, with the Coherence in the Bill; opens withal the Alterations, and &s;hews the Rea|&s;ons of the Committee for &s;uch Amendments, until he has gone through all. When that is done, if his Seat be not next the Floor, he mu&s;t come from his Place to the Bar, and &s;o come up to the Table; where he delivers both the Bill and A|mendments to the Clerk, to be read. Whil&s;t he &s;tands by the Clerk, the Clerk reads twice the Amendments only that are to be In&s;erted, and then he delivers the Bill with the Amend|ments to the Speaker.</P>
<P>Whereupon any Member may &s;peak again&s;t all, or any of the Amendments, and de&s;ire the Coherence to be read. But he is to make all his Objections at once to all the Amendments, without &s;peaking again.</P>
<P>Note, that in the Hou&s;e of Lords, the Judges, and other A&s;&s;i&s;tants there of the long Robe, are &s;ometimes Joyned to the Lords Commit|tees, though they have no Voice in the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>But whereas in the Hou&s;e they &s;it covered by the Leave of the Peers, at a Committee they are always uncovered.</P>
<P>A <HI>Grand Committee,</HI> called a <HI>Committee of the whole Hou&s;e,</HI> is the Hou&s;e it &s;elf re&s;olved into a
<PB N="34" REF="355">freedom of Debate from the Rules of the Hou&s;e to the Nature of a Committee; and therefore 'tis commonly called <HI>a Committee of the whole Hou&s;e.</HI> The&s;e Grand Committees are u&s;ed, when any great Bu&s;ine&s;s is in hand that requires much Debate; as Bills to impo&s;e a Tax, or rai&s;e Mony from the People. Which Bills particularly do always begin in the Hou&s;e of Commons, as their Repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>In the&s;e Committees every Member is free to &s;peak to one Que&s;tion as often as he &s;hall &s;ee Cau&s;e, (which is not permitted in the Hou&s;e) and to an&s;wer other Mens Rea&s;ons and Argu|ments. So that it is a more open Way, and &s;uch as leads mo&s;t to the Truth; the Pro|ceeding more honourable and advantagious, both to King and Parliament.</P>
<P>When the Hou&s;e inclines to re&s;olve it &s;elf into a Committee, it is done by a Que&s;tion. Which being carried in the Affirmative, the Speaker leaves the Chair, and thereupon the Committee makes choice of a <HI>Chair-man.</HI> If a Di&s;pute ari&s;es about the Choice, the Speaker is called back to his Chair; and after the Choice is cleared, he leaves it. The Chair|man &s;its in the Clerks Place at the Table, and writes the Votes of the Committee; the ga|thering whereof is according to the Rules of the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>When the Committee has gone through the Matter in hand, the Chair-man, having read all the Votes, puts the Que&s;tion, <HI>That the &s;ame be Reported to the Hou&s;e.</HI> If that be Re|&s;olved, he is to leave the Chair; and the Speaker being called again to the Chair, the Chair-man is to Report what has been re&s;olved at the Committee, &s;tanding in his u&s;ual Place. From whence, if it be not in the Seat next
<PB N="35" REF="355">the Floor, he is to go down to the Bar, and &s;o to bring up his Report to the Table.</P>
<P>In ca&s;e the Committee cannot perfect the Bu&s;ine&s;s at that &s;itting, Leave is to be asked, <HI>That the Committee may Sit at another time on that Bu&s;ine&s;s.</HI> But, if the Matter has been throughly Debated, and is judged fit to be Re&s;olved in the Hou&s;e, the Speaker is called to the Chair for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>In other Things the Proceedings are the &s;ame as in the Hou&s;e. And &s;o much for the Committees.</P>
<P>I proceed now to the Manner of <HI>Adjourn|ing, Proroguing,</HI> or <HI>Di&s;&s;olving</HI> the Parliament, which is done at the Kings Plea&s;ure, and that in the Hou&s;e of Lords, with the &s;ame Ap|pearance and Solemnity as I have already de|&s;cribed.</P>
<P>An <HI>Adjournment</HI> and <HI>Prorogation</HI> are to &s;ome convenient time appointed by the King him|&s;elf; but with this Difference, that an <HI>Ad|journment</HI> do's not conclude the Se&s;&s;ion, which a <HI>Prorogation</HI> do's. So that by an <HI>Adjournment</HI> all Things debated in both Hou&s;es remain <HI>in &s;tatu quo,</HI> and at the next Meeting may be brought to an I&s;&s;ue. Whereas a <HI>Prorogation</HI> makes a Se&s;&s;ion; and then &s;uch Bills as pa&s;&s;ed either Hou&s;e, or both Hou&s;es, and had not the Royal A&s;&s;ent, mu&s;t at the next A&s;&s;embly begin anew, before they can be brought to perfection.</P>
<P>Upon an <HI>Adjournment,</HI> or <HI>Prorogation,</HI> the King do's u&s;ually make a Speech to both Hou&s;es of Parliament. And he ought to be there in Per&s;on, or by Repre&s;entation, as on the Day of their fir&s;t &s;itting, Now the Kings Per&s;on may be repre&s;ented by Commi&s;&s;ion under the
<PB N="36" REF="356">Great Seal to certain Lords in Parliament, au|thorizing them to begin, adjourn, prorogue, &amp;c.</P>
<P>But 'tis Ob&s;ervable, that each Hou&s;e has al&s;o a Power to Adjourn them&s;elves, which when they do, 'tis at the mo&s;t but for a few Days.</P>
<P>A <HI>Di&s;&s;olution</HI> is that whereby the Hou&s;e of Commons becomes Vacant, in order to a new Election. Now a Parliament may be Di&s;&s;olved by the King at any time, whether they be actu|ally &s;itting, or not.</P>
<P>But, if a Parliament do &s;it, and be Di&s;&s;olved, without any Act of Parliament pa&s;&s;ed, or Judgment given, 'tis no Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament, but a Convention.</P>
<P>The King being the Head of the Parliament, if his Death happens when there is a Parlia|ment, 'tis <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> Di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P>'Twas a Cu&s;tom of old, after every Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament, for the Sheriff to Proclaim, by the Kings Command, the &s;everal Acts pa&s;&s;ed in that Se&s;&s;ion, that none might pretend Ignorance. And yet, without that Proclamation, the Law &s;uppo&s;es every one has noticeby his Repre&s;en|tative of what is tran&s;acted in Parliament. But that Cu&s;tom has been laid a&s;ide, &s;ince Printing came to be of common U&s;e.</P>
<P>The Parliament ought to &s;it, by Law, at lea&s;t once in three Years.</P>
<P>Thus I have laid open the Supream Court of England, which without the Kings Con|currence can legally, do nothing that's binding to the Nation, but with it can do any thing. For whatever is done by this Con&s;ent is called firm, &s;table, and <HI>&s;anctum,</HI> and is taken for Law. Thus the King and Parliament may abrogate old Laws, and make new, &s;ettle the Succe&s;&s;ion to the Crown, Define of doubtful Rights
<PB N="37" REF="356">whereof no Law is made, Appoint Taxes and Sub&s;idies, E&s;tabli&s;h Forms of Religion, Natu|ralize Aliens, Legitimate Ba&s;tards, Adjudge an Infant (or Minor) to be of full Age, At|taint a Man of Trea&s;on after his Death, Con|demn or Ab&s;olve them who are put upon their Trial, Give the mo&s;t free Pardons, Re&s;tore in Bloud and Name, &amp;c. And the Con&s;ent of the Parliament is taken to be the Con&s;ent of every Engli&s;hman, being there pre&s;ent in Per|&s;on, or by Procuration.</P>
<P>King John having re&s;igned up the Crown of England to the Pope, and &s;ubmitted to take it at his hand again at a yearly Tribute, the Pope (in the Reign of Edward III.) demanded his Rent, and all the Arrears. Upon which i&s;&s;ued this Re&s;olve of the Parliament, <HI>that neither the King, nor any other, could put the Realm, nor the People thereof, into a forein Subjection, with|out their A&s;&s;ent.</HI> This was a high Re&s;olution in Law, in one of the highe&s;t Points of Law, concerning the Kings Claim of an ab&s;olute Power, when the Pope was in his height. How|ever this intimates, that with their joynt Con|&s;ent the Crown may be di&s;po&s;ed of.</P>
<P>But, how tran&s;cendent &s;oever be the Power and Authority of the King and Parliament, yet it do's not extend &s;o far as to bar, re|&s;train, or make void &s;ub&s;equent Parliaments; and, tho divers Parliaments have attempted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, yet they could never effect it. For the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">atter Parliament hath &s;till a Power to abrogate, &s;u&s;pend, qualify, explain, or make void the former in the Whole, or any Part thereof, notwith&s;tanding any Words of Re&s;traint, Pro|hibition, or Penalty in the former; it being a Maxim in the Law of Parliament, <HI>Quod Leges
<PB N="38" REF="357">po&s;teriores priores contrarias abrogant.</HI> 'Twas therefore but in vain, that the late King James pretended &s;o to &s;ettle that Liberty of Con&s;cience which he u&s;hered in by his Declaration, as to make it a Law unalterable, like the Laws of the Medes and Per&s;ians. It was but a Blind for Di&s;&s;enters to bring them into his Snare; and, tho he had really de&s;igned it, he mu&s;t have been at lea&s;t Immortal to &s;ecure it.</P>
<P>One of the fundamental and principal Ends of Parliaments was to Redre&s;s Grievances, and ea&s;e the People of Oppre&s;&s;ions. The chief Care whereof is in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, as being the Grand Inque&s;t of the Realm, &s;ummoned from all Parts to pre&s;ent publick Grievances to be redre&s;&s;ed, and pub|lick Delinquents puni&s;hed, as corrupted Coun|&s;ellours, Judges, and Magi&s;trates. Therefore Parliaments are a great Check to Men in Authority, and con&s;equently abhorred by De|linquents. Who mu&s;t expect one time or other to be called to a &s;trict and impartial Account, and be puni&s;hed according to their Demerits. Remember, &s;aid the Lord Bacon to his Friend <HI>Sr. Lionel Cranfield,</HI> when he was made Lord Trea&s;urer, that <HI>a Parliament will come.</HI></P>
<P>In this Ca&s;e the Hou&s;e of Commons (the Parliament &s;itting) Impeaches, and the Hou&s;e of Lords are the Judges; the Commons In|form, Pre&s;ent, and Manage the Evidence, the Lords upon a full Trial give Judgment upon it. And &s;uch is the Priviledge of the Hou&s;e of Commons in this particular, that they may Impeach the highe&s;t Lord in the Kingdom, either Spiritual or Temporal; and he is not to have the benefit of the <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> Act (that is, he cannot come out upon Bail) till
<PB N="39" REF="357">his Trial be over, or the Parliament Di&s;&s;olved, which la&s;t &s;ome of the late Judges have de|clared for. But the Lords cannot proceed a|gain&s;t a Commoner, except upon a Complaint of the Commons.</P>
<P>In a Ca&s;e of Mi&s;demeanour both the Lords Spiritual and Temporal are Judges, and the Kings A&s;&s;ent to the Judgment is not nece&s;&s;ary. But, if the Crime be Capital, the Lords Spiri|tual (tho, as Barons, they might &s;it as Judges, yet they) ab&s;ent them&s;elves during the Trial; becau&s;e, by the Decrees of the Church, they may not be Judges of Life and Death. For, by an Ordinance made at the Council at We&s;t|min&s;ter in 21 Hen. 2. all Clergymen were for|bidden <HI>agitare Judicium Sanguinis,</HI> upon pain to be deprived both of Dignities and Orders.</P>
<P>When a Peer is Impeached of High Trea|&s;on, a Court is u&s;ually erected for his Trial in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall; and the King makes a Lord Steward (which commonly is the Lord Chan|cellour) to &s;it as Judge thereof. The Trial being over, the Lords Temporal re&s;orting to their Hou&s;e give Judgment upon it, by Voting the Party arraigned, upon their Honours, <HI>Guilty, or not Guilty;</HI> and he is either Con|demned, or Acquitted by the Plurality of Voices. If found Guilty, he receives Sentence accord|ingly by the Mouth of the Lord High Ste|ward.</P>

<P>In Ca&s;e of Recovery of Damages, or Re&s;ti|tution, the Parties are to have their Remedy (the Parliament being ended) in the Chance|ry, and not in any inferiour Court at the Com|mon Law. But the Lords in Parliament may direct how it &s;hall be levied.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, by the ancient Laws and Con&s;titu|tions of this Kingdom, it belongs to the Hou&s;e of Peers to interpret Acts of Parliament, in Time of Parliament, in any Cau&s;e that &s;hall be brought before Them.</P>
<P>I conclude with the <HI>Priviledges of Parlia|ment,</HI> which are great in both Hou&s;es, and fit for &s;o honourable a Court.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, as to the Per&s;ons of the Commoners, they are Priviledged from Suits, Arre&s;ts, Im|pri&s;onments, except in Ca&s;e of Trea&s;on and Felony; al&s;o, from Attendance on Trials in inferiour Courts, &s;erving on Juries, and the like. Their nece&s;&s;ary Servants that tend upon them during the Parliament, are al&s;o Priviledged from Arre&s;t, except in the afore&s;aid Ca&s;es. Which Priviledge is their due, <HI>eundo, morando, redeundo,</HI> that is, not only for that time the Parliament &s;its, but al&s;o during 40 Days before, and 40 Days after the Parliament fini&s;hed. And that, not only for the Per&s;ons of Mem|bers, and their nece&s;&s;ary Servants; but al&s;o, in &s;ome Ca&s;es, for their Goods and E&s;tates du|ring that Time.</P>
<P>Moreover this Priviledge do's likewi&s;e ex|tend to &s;uch Officers as attend the Parliament; as the Clerks, the Sergeant at Arms, the Por|ter of the Door, and the like.</P>
<PB N="41" REF="358">

<HEAD>CHAP. II. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the King's Privy Council.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>NEXT to the Court of Parliament, which is the great Wheel that gives motion to the re&s;t, is <HI>the Kings Privy Council.</HI> A Court of great Honour and Antiquity; In|corporated (as it were) to the King Him&s;elf, and bearing part of his Cares in the great Bu|fine&s;s of the Government. In&s;omuch that, up|on their Wi&s;dom, Care, and Watchfulne&s;s de|pends the Honour and Welfare of His Maje|&s;ties Dominions, in all Parts of the World. For, according to their Oath, they are chiefly to Advi&s;e the King upon all Emergencies to the be&s;t of their Judgment, with all the Fide|lity and Secrecy that becomes their Station. And, as the King has the &s;ole Nomination of them, &s;o 'tis his main Intere&s;t to make choice of &s;uch eminent Per&s;ons as are be&s;t able, with their Wi&s;dom, Experience, and Integrity, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;wer tho&s;e great Ends they are appointed for.</P>
<P>They ought to be Per&s;ons of &s;everal Capa|cities, that nothing be wanting for good Coun|&s;el and Advice in a Court from whence in a great mea&s;ure depends the Safety, Honour, and
<PB N="44" REF="360">Welfare of the King and Kingdom. General|ly they are pickt out among&s;t the Nobility; and, for Things that relate to Church Affairs the Arch-bi&s;hop of Canterbury and the Bi&s;hop of London u&s;e to be Members thereof.</P>
<P>In the late Kings Reign, not only Popi&s;h Lords were admitted contrary to Law; but, in defiance as it were of the Nation, a Tray|tor by the Law, and the wor&s;t of Coun&s;ellours, a mercurial hot-headed <HI>Je&s;uit,</HI> who&s;e perni|cious Coun&s;els and Influences proved accord|ingly fatal to King James, and all the Po|pi&s;h Party.</P>
<P>As for the Number of Privy Coun&s;ellours, 'tis at His Maje&s;ties plea&s;ure. Anciently they u&s;ed to be but twelve, or thereabouts; but, &s;ince, their Number has increa&s;ed &s;ometimes to forty.</P>
<P>The Privy Council is kept in the Kings Court, or Pallace, and the King him&s;elf do's commonly &s;it with them. The u&s;ual Days for their &s;itting is Wedne&s;days and Fridays, in the Morning out of Parliament or Term-time, and in the Afternoon in Parliament or Term|time. But, upon extraordinary Occa&s;ions, the King calls them together at any time. Ac|cordingly they wait on His Maje&s;ty in the Council-Chamber, and fit at the Council Board in their Order, bare-headed, when the King pre&s;ides. To whom His Maje&s;ty declares what He thinks fit, and de&s;ires their Advice in it. At all Debates the lowe&s;t Coun&s;ellour delivers his Opinion fir&s;t, that &s;o he may be the more free; and the King la&s;t of all, by declaring his Judgment, determines the Matter.</P>
<P>'Tis with the Advice of the Privy Council, that the King puts out Proclamations, Orders, and Declarations, which being grounded upon
<PB N="45" REF="360">Statute, or Common Law, are binding to the &s;ubject. And, upon any &s;udden Emergency, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">herein the publick Safety may be Indangered, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or want of &s;peedy Redre&s;s, the King and Council may take a latitude of Power &s;utable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Formerly the Council heard and determi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed Cau&s;es between Party and Party. But of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">te, le&s;t private Cau&s;es &s;hould hinder the Pub|lick, they &s;eldom meddle with them, but leave <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">em to the Kings Courts of Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>There are two di&s;tinct and important Offices <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">longing to this Court. The fir&s;t is the <HI>Lord Pre&s;idents,</HI> who is one of the Nine Great officers of the Crown. He is called Lord Pre|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">dent of the Privy Council, becau&s;e by his office he is in a manner the Director of it. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">Tis he that reports to the King, when His <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aje&s;ty has been ab&s;ent from the Council, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ate of the Bu&s;ine&s;&s;es tran&s;acted there.</P>
<P>The other Great Office is that of <HI>Secretary,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mmonly called a <HI>Secretary of State;</HI> which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rmerly was &s;ingle, till about the end of Henry III. his Reign. Who, con&s;idering the Im|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rtance of this great and weighty Office, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ought fit to have it di&s;charged by two Per|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ns of equal Authority, and therefore both <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed <HI>Principal Secretaries of State.</HI></P>
<P>In tho&s;e Days, and &s;ome while after (&s;ays <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Chamberlain</HI>) they &s;at not at Council-board. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, having prepared their Bu&s;ine&s;s in a Room joyning to the Council-Chamber, they came <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and &s;tood on either hand of the King; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d nothing was debated at the Table, until <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Secretaries had gone through with their
<PB N="46" REF="361">Propo&s;als. Which Method afterwards was al|tered in Q. Elizabeths Reign; who &s;eldom coming to Council ordered the two Secretaries to take their places as Privy Coun&s;ellours, which has continued ever &s;ince. And a Coun|cil is &s;eldom or never held, without the pre|&s;ence of one of them at the lea&s;t.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the publick Concerns of the Nation, mo&s;t of which pa&s;s through their hands, they are al&s;o concerned with Grants, Pardons, Di&s;|pen&s;ations, &amp;c. relating to private Per&s;ons. For in their hands are lodged mo&s;t of the Sub|jects Reque&s;ts to be repre&s;ented to the King; whereupon they make Di&s;patches, according to His Maje&s;ties Directions. In &s;hort, &s;o great is their Tru&s;t, and their Imployment of that great latitude, that it requires their con&s;tant Attendance upon the King.</P>
<P>As for Home Concerns, whether publick o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> private, both the Secretaries do equally re|ceive and di&s;patch whatever is brought to them. But, for forein Affairs, each has his di&s;tinct Province; receiving all Letters and Addre&s;&s;e from, and making all Di&s;patches to the &s;evera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Princes and States in his Province.</P>
<P>They keep each of them his Office (called the <HI>Secretaries Office</HI>) at Whitehall: Where they have al&s;o Lodgings for their own Accom|modation, and tho&s;e that attend upon it; wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a liberal Diet at the Kings Charge, or Board wages in lieu of it.

<P>The Secretaries and Clerks they imploy u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|der them are wholly at their own choice, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> have no Dependance upon any other.</P>
<PB N="47" REF="361">
<P>La&s;tly, they have the Cu&s;tody of the <HI>Signet,</HI> one of the Kings Seals. To which belongs the <HI>Signet-Office,</HI> where four Clerks wait Monthly by turns, preparing &s;uch Things as are to pa&s;s the <HI>Signet,</HI> in order to the Privy Seal, or Great Seal. He that is in waiting is always to at|tend the Court, where&s;oever it removes; and to prepare &s;uch Bills or Letters for the King to &s;ign (not being Matter of Law) as by War|rant from the King, or Secretaries of State, or Lords of the Council he is directed to prepare. And to this Office all Grants prepared by them|&s;elves, or the Kings Learned Council at Law, for the Kings hand, are returned, when &s;igned, and there tran&s;cribed again. The Tran&s;cripti|on is carried to one of the Principal Secreta|ties of State, to be &s;ealed with the Signet. This done, it is directed to the Lord Privy Seal, and is his Warrant for i&s;&s;uing out a Privy Seal upon it. But then it mu&s;t be fir&s;t tran&s;|cribed by the Clerks of the Seal, who are al&s;o four in Number; and, when it has the Privy Seal affixt, 'tis &s;ufficient for the Payment of any Monies out of the Exchequer, and for &s;e|veral other U&s;es. If the Grant requires the pa&s;&s;ing the Great Seal, as &s;everal Grants do, the Privy Seal is a Warrant to the Lord Chan|cellour (or the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners) to pa&s;s it, as the Signet was to the Lord Privy Seal. But here al&s;o a new Tran&s;cription mu&s;t be made of the Grant. The Rea&s;on why a Grant mu&s;t go through &s;o many Hands and Seals, be|fore it can be perfected, is, that it may be duly con&s;idered, and all Objections cleared, be|fore it take its effect.</P>
<P>The <HI>Paper-Office,</HI> at Whitehall, is al&s;o de|pending on the Secretaries of State. Where all the Papers and Di&s;patches that pa&s;s through
<PB N="48" REF="362">their Offices (as Matters of State and Council, Letters, Intelligences, and Negotiations of forein Mini&s;ters here, or of the Kings Mini&s;ters abroad) are from time to time tran&s;mitted, and there remain, di&s;po&s;ed by way of Library. The Keeper whereof has a yearly Salary of 160 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> payable out of the Exchequer.</P>
<P>To conclude, the Lords of the Privy Coun|cil have always been of &s;uch high value and e&s;teem, that if a Man did but &s;trike another in a Privy Coun&s;ellors Hou&s;e, or el&s;ewhere in his pre&s;ence, he was fined for the &s;ame. To con|&s;pire the Death of any of them was Felony in any of the Kings Servants, and to kill one of them was High Trea&s;on.</P>
<P>A Privy Coun&s;ellour, though but a Gentle|man, has precedence of all Knights Baronets, and younger Sons of all Barons and Vi&s;counts. And a Secretary of State has this &s;pecial Ho|nour, that, if he be a Baron, he takes place (as &s;uch) of all other Barons. So honourable an Imployment it is, that in the late Reign the Earl of Sunderland, was both principal Se|cretary of State, and Lord Pre&s;ident of the Privy Council.</P>

<P>All the fore-mentioned Courts are opened four times a Year, called the four Terms; Viz. <HI>Ea&s;ter, Trinity, Michaelmas,</HI> and <HI>Hilary Term.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ea&s;ter-Term</HI> begins always the 17th Day after Ea&s;ter, and la&s;teth 27 Days. <HI>Trinity</HI> (or <HI>Mid|&s;ummer</HI>) <HI>Term</HI> begins the fifth Day after Trini|ty Sunday, and la&s;teth 20 Days. <HI>Michaelmas-Term</HI> begins the 23th of October, and la&s;teth 37 Days.

<P>Next to the Parliament of England, and the Kings Privy Council, by who&s;e Influences the Nation is chiefly governed under the King, the <HI>High Court of Chancery</HI> is the chief, and the mo&s;t ancient Court of Judicature. Other|wi&s;e
<PB N="50" REF="363">called the <HI>Court of Equity,</HI> in oppo&s;ition to other inferiour Courts, the Judges whereof are tied to the Letter of the Law; Whereas this is a Court of Mercy, in which the Rigour of the Law is tempered with Equity. And there|fore the Kings of England would have this Court Superiour to the other Tribunals, as well as for being the Original of all other Courts, and the Fountain of all our Proceedings in Law. For, as <HI>Sir Edward Coke</HI> &s;ays, this Court is <HI>Of|ficina Ju&s;titiae,</HI> out of which all Original Writs and all Commi&s;&s;ions which pa&s;s under the Great Seal go forth, which Great Seal is <HI>Clavis Regni,</HI> the Key of the Kingdom; and for tho&s;e ends this Court is always open.</P>
<P>In the Chancery are two Courts, one Ordi|nary, and the other Extraordinary. In the fir&s;t the Proceedings are in Latine, <HI>Secundum Legem &amp; Con&s;uetudinem Angliae,</HI> according to the Laws and Statutes of the Realm. In the &s;econd, by Engli&s;h Bill, <HI>Secundum aequum &amp; bonum,</HI> accor|ding to Equity.</P>
<P>The Manner of Proceeding is much like that in the Courts of the Civil Law; the Actions by Bill or Plaint, the Witne&s;&s;es examined in private, and the Decrees in Engli&s;h or Latin, not in French. No Jury of twelve Men, but all Sentences given by the Judge of the Court.</P>

<P>The chief of them is the <HI>Ma&s;ter of the Rolls,</HI> who&s;e Place is both very honourable and bene|ficial. The &s;ame is in the King's Gift, either Life, or during his Maje&s;ties Plea&s;ure.

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the Court of Kings Bench.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THis Court is called the <HI>Kings Bench,</HI> be|cau&s;e in it are handled all Pleas of the Crown; as all manner of Trea&s;ons, Felonies, Mi&s;pri&s;ion of Trea&s;on, &amp;c.</P>
<P>But it has Power be&s;ides to examine and cor|rect all Errours <HI>in fait,</HI> and in Law, of all the Judges and Ju&s;tices of the Realm in their Judge|ments and Proceeding in Courts of Record; and this not only in Pleas of the Crown, but in all Pleas real, per&s;onal, and mixt, the Court of Exchequer excepted.</P>
<P>This Court has al&s;o Power to correct other Errours and Mi&s;demeanors extrajudicial, tend|ing to the Breach of the Peace, or Oppre&s;&s;ion of the Subject. It grants Prohibitions to Courts Temporal and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical, to Keep them with|in their proper Juri&s;diction; and may bail any Per&s;on for any Offence what&s;oever. If a Free|man in City, Borough, or Town Corporate, be Disfranchi&s;ed unju&s;tly, this Court may relieve the Party, although he has no Priviledge in it.</P>
<P>This Court moreover has power to hold Plea by Bill for Debt, Detinue, Covenant, Promi&s;e, and all other per&s;onal Actions, again&s;t any that is in the Mar&s;hals Cu&s;tody, or any Officer, Mi|ni&s;ter, or Clerk of the Court. For, if they &s;hould be &s;ued in any other Court, they would
<PB N="56" REF="366">be allowed the Priviledge of this, in re&s;pect of their nece&s;&s;ary Attendance here; and, le&s;t there &s;hould be a failure of Ju&s;tice, they &s;hall be Im|pleaded here by Bill, though the&s;e Actions be common Pleas. Likewi&s;e the Officers, Mini|&s;ters, and Clerks of this Court, priviledged by Law, may Implead others by Bill here in the fore&s;aid Actions.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the Juri&s;diction of this Court is ge|neral, and extends all over England. 'Tis more uncontrolable than any other Court, becau&s;e the Law pre&s;umes the King to be there in per|&s;on. For anciently the Kings of England &s;at &s;ometimes in this Court, and that on a high Bench, his Judges at his Feet, on a low Bench. From whence &s;ome think this Court came to be called the <HI>King's Bench.</HI> However the Judica|ture always belonged to the Judges, and in the King's pre&s;ence (as now in his ab&s;ence) they an&s;wered all Motions, &amp;c.</P>
<P>So Supream is al&s;o the Juri&s;diction of this Court, that, if any Record be removed hither, it cannot (being as it were in its Center) be remanded back, but by an Act of Parlia|ment.</P>
<P>In this Court &s;it commonly four Grave Re|verend Judges, The principal whereof is called the <HI>Lord Chief Ju&s;tice of the King's Bench,</HI> and is thus created by Writ. <HI>A. B. Militi Salutem. Sciatis quod Con&s;tituimus Vos Judiciarium no|&s;trum Capitalem, ad Placita coram nobis tenenda, durante Beneplacito no&s;tro. Te&s;te meip&s;o apud</HI> We&s;tm.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the Judges of the King's Bench hold their Places by Letters Patent in the&s;e Words. <HI>Rex omnibus ad quos prae&s;entes Litera pervenerint, Salutem. Sciatis quod Con&s;tituimus dilectum &amp; fidelem B. C. Militem unum Ju&s;ticia|riorum,
<PB N="57" REF="366">ad Placita coram nobis tenenda, durante Beneplacito no&s;tro. Te&s;te,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Though in the Writ or Patent made to the&s;e Judges they are not named Sergeants, yet none can be a Judge of this Court, unle&s;s he be a Sergeant of the Degree of the Coif, that is, a Sergeant at Law; who, upon taking this De|gree, is obliged to wear a Lawn Coif under a black Cap.</P>
<P>The&s;e Judges, or Ju&s;tices, are the Sovereign Ju&s;tices of <HI>Oyer</HI> and <HI>Terminer,</HI> Goal-Delivery, Con&s;ervators of the Peace, &amp;c. in the Realm. So that, when this Court comes and &s;its in any County, the Ju&s;tices of <HI>Eire,</HI> of <HI>Oyer</HI> and <HI>Ter|miner,</HI> and <HI>Goal-Delivery,</HI> &amp;c. are <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> void, without writing to them. They are likewi&s;e the Sovereign Coroners of the Land; and there|fore where the Sheriff and Coroners may receive Appeals by Bill, much rather the Ju&s;tices of this Court may do it.</P>
<P>Their Salary from the King is each 1000 l. <HI>per Annum,</HI> be&s;ides Robes and Liveries out of the great Wardrobe, and two Tun of Wine to the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>In this Court all young Lawyers that have been called to the Bar are allowed to practi&s;e.</P>
<P>Here are three di&s;tinct <HI>Offices;</HI> Viz. the <HI>Crown Office,</HI> the <HI>Protonotaries,</HI> and the <HI>Cu&s;tos Brevium's Office.</HI></P>
<P>To the fir&s;t belong, the <HI>Clerk of the Crown,</HI> a <HI>Secondary,</HI> and &s;everal <HI>entring Clerks.</HI> The fir&s;t is a Cap-Officer, who &s;its covered in Court.

<P><HI>Of the Court of Common-Pleas.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THis Court is &s;o called, becau&s;e here are debated the u&s;ual Pleas between Subject and Subject. For in this Court all Civil Cau&s;es, real and per&s;onal, are u&s;ually tried, ac|cording to the &s;trictne&s;s of the Law. And real Actions are pleadable; nor Fines levied, or Re|coveries &s;uffered, in no other Court but this. Which may al&s;o grant Prohibitions, as the Court of the King's Bench doth.</P>
<P>Here are al&s;o commonly four Judges, the chief whereof is called the <HI>Lord Chief Ju&s;tice of the Common Pleas,</HI> or <HI>of the Common Bench.</HI> Who holds his Place by Letters Patent, as the other Three do, <HI>derante Beneplacito.</HI> Their Fee is the &s;ame as that of the King's Bench Judges.</P>
<P>None but Sergeants at Law may plead in this Court; and &s;o many of them as the King &s;hall appoint, are bound by Oath to a&s;&s;i&s;t all that have any Cau&s;e depending here; for which the King allows them Fees, Reward, and Robes.</P>
<P>Many are the Officers belonging to this Court. The principal whereof is the <HI>Cu&s;tos Brevium,</HI> who is the fir&s;t Clerk of the Court, and who&s;e Office is to receive and keep all Writs returna|ble here, to receive of the Protonotaries all the Records of <HI>Ni&s;i-prius,</HI> called <HI>Po&s;teas.</HI> He holds
<PB N="60" REF="368">his Place by Patent from the King, has the Gift of the &s;econd Protontaries Place, and of the Clerk of the Juries.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Three Protonotaries,</HI> who enter and in|roll all Declarations, Pleadings, A&s;&s;izes, Judg|ments, and Actions, and make out Judicial Writs. In who&s;e Offices all the Attorneys of this Court enter their Cau&s;es.</P>
<P>Now each of them has a <HI>Secondary,</HI> who draws up the Rules of Court, &amp;c. And the&s;e Se|condaries are commonly the able&s;t Clerks or Attorneys of the Court.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o a <HI>Chirographer,</HI> who&s;e chief Bu|&s;ine&s;s is to ingro&s;s Fines acknowledged; and for who&s;e Office there is a <HI>Regi&s;ter,</HI> and &s;e|veral <HI>Clerks,</HI> having their &s;everal Counties al|lotted them, for which they Ingro&s;s the Fines levied of Lands in their re&s;pective Divi|&s;ions.</P>

The <HI>Clerk of the Inrollments of Fines and Recoveries,</HI> who is by Statute under the three Pui&s;ne Judges of this Court, and removable at their Plea&s;ure. 3. The <HI>Clerk of the Outlawries;</HI> who, after the Party is returned Outlawed, makes out the Writs of <HI>Capias Uelegatum,</HI> in the name of the Attorney General, to whom
<PB N="61" REF="368">this Office does properly belong, and who ex|erci&s;eth it by Deputy.</P>
<P>There is be&s;ides a <HI>Clerk of the Warrants,</HI> who enters all Warrants of Attorney for Plaintiff and Defendant, and inrolls all Deeds acknow|ledged before any of the Judges of the Com|mon Pleas.</P>
<P>The <HI>Clerk of the King's Silver,</HI> to whom e|very Fine (or final Agreement upon Sale of Land) is brought, after it has been with the <HI>Cu&s;tos Brevium,</HI> and to whom Mony is paid for the King's U&s;e.</P>
<P>The <HI>Clerk of the Juries,</HI> who makes out the Writs called <HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> and other Writs for appearance of the Jury.</P>

<P>The <HI>four Exigenters;</HI> who&s;e Office is to make all Exigents and Proclamations in all Actions where Proce&s;s of Outlawry does ly.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe&s;e two I joyn together, becau&s;e they both concern the King's Revenue, and take Cognizance of all Cau&s;es ari&s;ing from it.</P>
<P>The Judges of this Court are called <HI>Barons of the Exchequer,</HI> ever &s;ince Barons of the Realm u&s;ed to &s;it here as Judges; though in latter times Men learned in the Law have u&s;ually fil|led up this Station. They are commonly four that &s;it in this Tribunal, as in the two former Courts; the principal whereof is &s;tiled Lord <HI>Chief Baron.</HI> But 'tis to be ob&s;erved, that the Lord Trea&s;urer and the Chancellour of the Ex|chequer, may &s;it here as Principal, though they &s;eldom do it.</P>
<P>The Lord Chief Baron is created by Letters Patents, to hold this Dignity, <HI>Quamdiu &s;e bene ge&s;&s;erit,</HI> which the Law intends for Life; &s;o that he is better fixed than either of the Chief Ju&s;tices. His Place is of great Honour and Profit. In Matter of Law, Information, and Plea, he an&s;wers the Bar, and gives Order for Judgement thereupon. He alone in the Term-time
<PB N="63" REF="369">doth &s;it upon <HI>Ni&s;i prius,</HI> that come out of the King's Remembrancer's Office, or out of the Office of the Clerk of the Pleas, which can not be di&s;patched in the Mornings for want of time. He takes Recognizances for the King's Debts, for Appearances, and Ob&s;erving of Or|ders. He takes the Pre&s;entation of all Officers in Court under him&s;elf, and of the Mayor of London, and &s;ees the King's Remembrancer to give them their Oaths. He al&s;o takes the Declaration of certain Receivers Accounts of the Lands of the late Augmentation made before him by the Auditors of the Shires, and gives two <HI>Parcel-makers</HI> Places by vertue of his Office.</P>
<P>In his ab&s;ence, his Place is &s;upplied by the o|ther three Barons, his A&s;&s;i&s;tants, according to their Seniority.</P>
<P>The&s;e Judges, and tho&s;e of the two former Courts of King's Bench and Common Pleas, make up the Number of Twelve; who all &s;it in on their Tribunals in Robes, and &s;quare Caps.</P>
<P>Next to the four Barons of this Court, is fir&s;t the <HI>Cur&s;itor,</HI> who admini&s;ters the Oath to the Sheriffs, Under-Sheriffs, Bayliffs, Searchers, Surveyors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Then the <HI>King's Remembrancer,</HI> in who&s;e Of|fice are entred the States of all Accompts what|&s;oever concerning the King's Revenue, except Sheriffs and Bayliffs Accounts.

From whence accordingly i&s;&s;ue forth Proce&s;s, to cau&s;e all Accountants to come in, and ac|count. And, as the Exchequer do's con&s;i&s;t of two Courts, the one of Law, and the other of Equity, all Proceedings touching the &s;ame are in this Office, with many other Things relating to the Kings Revenue.

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the Sheriffs, and their two Courts, called the County-Court, and the Sheriffs Turn; of Ju&s;tices of Peace, and their Quarter-Se&s;&s;ions; with an Account of the Grand Jury; of the Coroners, Clerks of the Markets, and their Courts.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>FOR the Civil Government of Counties, Cities, Towns, and Villages, there are divers Officers, to whom belong &s;everal Courts for the due Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t in every County (except Durham and We&s;tmorland) there is a <HI>Sheriff,</HI> which is a yearly Office, the Power whereof extends all over the County, except &s;uch Cities and Towns as are Counties of them&s;elves, that is, which have the Priviledge of Counties. In Middle|&s;ex only there are two <HI>Sheriffs,</HI> upon the ac|count of London the Capital City of the King|dom.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sheriffs</HI> were heretofore cho&s;en, as Knights of the Shire, by the Suffrages of the People: But now they are appointed by the King, after this manner. Fir&s;t the Judges no|minate &s;ix fit Men of each County, that is, Knights or E&s;quires of good E&s;tates. Out of
<PB N="68" REF="372">that Number three are cho&s;en by the Privy Coun&s;ellors, and the twelve Judges a&s;&s;embled in the Exchequer, and there &s;worn in order to it. And out of this Number the King him|&s;elf chu&s;es whom he thinks fit.</P>
<P>Heretofore the &s;ame Sheriff &s;erved many years together, and to this day this Office is hereditary to the <HI>Cliffords</HI> in the County of We&s;tmorland, by Charter from King John.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sheriffs</HI> Office is both Mini&s;terial, and Judicial. As Mini&s;terial, he is to execute the Kings Mandates, and all Writs directed to him out of the Kings Courts, to Impannel Juries, to bring Cau&s;es and Criminals to Trial, and to &s;ee the Sentences executed. In &s;hort, there is no Execution of the Law but by the Sheriff, for by him all Suits begin, and all Proce&s;s &s;erved. He is likewi&s;e to collect all publick Profit, as Taxes, Fines, Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and Amer|ciaments into the Kings Exche quer, or where|ever the King &s;hall appoint; and to make &s;uch Payments out of it, as he &s;hall have due Order for. At the A&s;&s;izes he is to wait on, and gard the Itinerant Judges, &s;o long as they continue within the County.</P>
<P>As to the Judicial Part of his Office, he holds, by virtue thereof, two &s;everal Courts; the one called the <HI>County-Court,</HI> and the other the <HI>Sheriffs Turn.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>County-Court</HI> is held every Month by the <HI>Sheriff</HI> him&s;elf, or his Deputy the <HI>&V;nder Sheriff</HI> wherein he hears and determines Civil Cau&s;es of the County under 40 &s;hillings, which an|ciently was a con&s;iderable Sum. But this is no Court of Record.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sheriffs Turn</HI> is held twice a Year, viz. within a month after Ea&s;ter, and within a mont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> after Michaelmas. In this Court he inquire
<PB N="69" REF="372">of all Criminal Offences again&s;t the Common Law, wherein he is not re&s;trained by any Statute. For all the Bi&s;hops, Earls, Barons, and all &s;uch as have Hundreds of their own to be kept, are exempted from the Juri&s;diction of this Court. In &s;hort, this is a Court of Re|cord, in all Things that belong to it. 'Tis the Kings Leet through all the County, whereof the <HI>Sheriff</HI> is Judge, this Court being incident to his Office.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ju&s;tices of Peace,</HI> anciently called <HI>War|dens</HI> (or <HI>Gardians</HI>) <HI>of the Peace,</HI> are &s;uch a|mong&s;t the Gentry (and &s;ometimes among&s;t the Clergy) as are appointed by the Kings Com|mi&s;&s;ion to attend the Peace of the County where they dwell.</P>
<P>Their Original is from the fir&s;t year of Ed|ward the III, but they were not called Ju&s;tices till the 36th Year of his Reign.</P>
<P>Their Office is to call before them, ex|amine, and commit to Pri&s;on Rioters, wan|dering Rogues, Thieves, Murderers, fal&s;e Moneyers, tho&s;e that hold Con&s;piracies, and almo&s;t all Delinquents that may occa&s;ion the Breach of Peace and Quiet to the Kings Sub|jects, and to &s;ee them brought forth in due time to Trial.</P>
<P>If any one Swears him&s;elf to be in danger of his Life upon the Threats of another, he may bind him over to his good Behaviour, and the Ju&s;tice &s;hall commit him to Pri&s;on, unle&s;s the finds good Security for his good Behaviour during a Year and a Day.</P>
<P>Among the Ju&s;tices of Peace, the Number whereof is as His Maje&s;ty thinks fit, there are &s;ome particularly called <HI>Ju&s;tices of the Quorum,</HI> from the&s;e Words in the Commi&s;&s;ion, <HI>Quorum
<PB N="70" REF="373">A.B. unum e&s;&s;e volumus.</HI> As for Example, Where a Commi&s;&s;ion is directed to &s;even Per&s;ons, or any three of them <HI>Whereof</HI> A.B. and C.D. to be two, the&s;e are &s;aid to be of the <HI>Quorum,</HI> becau&s;e the re&s;t cannot proceed without them. So that a <HI>Ju|&s;tice of Peace and Quorum</HI> is one without whom the re&s;t of the Ju&s;tices in &s;ome Ca&s;es cannot proceed.</P>
<P>Every Quarter, or three Months, the <HI>Ju&s;tices</HI> of each County meet at the chief (or Shire) Town; from whence this Court came to be called the <HI>Quarter Se&s;&s;ions.</HI> Where the Grand Inque&s;t (or Jury) of the County is &s;ummoned to appear; who upon Oath are to inquire of Malefactors, Rioters, and &s;u&s;pected Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>The <HI>G and Jury</HI> do's commonly con&s;i&s;t of 24 grave and &s;ub&s;tantial Gentlemen, or &s;ome of the better &s;ort or Yeomen, cho&s;en indiffe|rently (or at lea&s;t ought &s;o to be) by the Sheriff out of the whole Shire, to con&s;ider of all Bills of Inditement preferred to the Court. Which Bills they do either approve by Writing upon them <HI>Billa Vera,</HI> or di&s;allow by indor&s;ing <HI>Ignoramus.</HI> Pre&s;ently upon the Allowance of a Bill, the Party concerned is &s;aid to be Indited, and is committed to Pri&s;on. But what Bills are Di&s;allowed are delivered to the Bench, by whom they are forthwith cancelled or torn. If the approved Bills touch Life and Death, they are further referred to another Jury to be con&s;idered of, becau&s;e the Ca&s;e is of &s;uch Importance; but others of lighter moment are proceeded upon by fining the De|linquents, without any more ado. Unle&s;s the Party traver&s;e the Inditement, or challenge it for In&s;ufficiency, or remove the Cau&s;e to a higher Court by <HI>Certiorari;</HI> in which two former Ca&s;es it is referred to another Jury, and in the latter tran&s;mitted to a higher
<PB N="71" REF="373">Court. In &s;hort, the Trial is u&s;ually referred to the next A&s;&s;izes, when the Judges at We&s;t|min&s;ter go their Circuits.</P>
<P>Originally this Court &s;eems to have been erected only for Matters touching the Peace, but now it extends much further. The She|riff, or his Under-Sheriff, is bound to attend upon this Court, with his Con&s;tables, Bay|liffs, &amp;c.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o in every County commonly four Officers, called <HI>Coroners</HI> (vulgarly pro|nounced <HI>Crowners</HI>) becau&s;e they deal princi|pally with Pleas of the Crown, or Matters concerning the Crown. His Office is to In|quire by a Jury of Neighbours how and by whom any Per&s;on came by a violent Death, and to enter the &s;ame upon Record. And, whereas the Sheriff in his Turn may inquire of all Felonies by the Common Law, except a Mans Death; the Coroner can inquire of no Felony but of the Death of Man, and that <HI>&s;uper vi&s;um Corporis,</HI> upon view of the Body. Which Inqui&s;ition of Death taken by him he ought to deliver at the next Goal-Delivery, or certify the &s;ame into the Kings Bench. Therefore he ought to put in writing the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ffect of the Evidence given to the Jury be|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ore him, and has power to bind over Wit|ne&s;&s;es to the next Goal-Delivery in that Coun|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y.</P>
<P>For doing his Office, he is to take nothing, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pon grievous Forfeiture. But by 3 <HI>H.</HI> 7. he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to have upon an Inditement of Murder 13 <ABBR>s. d.</ABBR> of the Goods of the Murderer.</P>
<P>But, be&s;ides his Judicial, he has likewi&s;e a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ini&s;terial Power as a Sheriff. As, when there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ju&s;t Exception taken to the Sheriff, Judi|cial

<P>There are, as I &s;aid before, commonly four of the&s;e Officers in every County of England. But <HI>Che&s;hire</HI> has but two, and each Shire in Wales has no more.</P>
<P>The &s;ame are cho&s;en by the Freeholders of the County, by virtue of a Writ out of the Chancery; and continue, notwith&s;tanding the Demi&s;e of the King, in their Office. Which was of old in &s;o great e&s;teem, that none could have it under the degree of a Knight. And, by the Writ <HI>De Coronatore eligendo,</HI> the Party to be cho&s;en mu&s;t have &s;ufficient Knowledge and Ability to execute this Office; which is implied in the&s;e Words, <HI>Et talem eligi facias qui melius &s;ciat &amp; po&s;&s;it Officio illi intendere.</HI> After he is elected, the Sheriff is to take his Oath, only to execute his Office.

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of Mayors and Aldermen, Bailiffs, Stewards, and their re&s;pective Courts; with an Account of the Con&s;tables.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>Every City of England, &s;ays <HI>Dr. Chamber|lain,</HI> is, by their Charters or Priviledges granted by &s;everal Kings, a little Com|mon-wealth apart; governed, not (as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ties of France and Spain) by a Nobleman <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Gentleman placed there by the King, but wholly by them&s;elves. For in Cities the Ci|tizens chu&s;e them&s;elves for their Governour <HI>Mayor,</HI> commonly out of 12 Aldermen. And, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n &s;ome other Corporations, a <HI>Bayliff</HI> is cho&s;en <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f a certain Number of Burge&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mayor</HI> is the Kings Lieutenant, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uring his Mayoralty (which is but for one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ear) is in a manner a Judge to determine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">atters, and to mitigate the Rigour of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">w. Therefore he keeps a Court, with his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ethren the <HI>Aldermen.</HI> With the&s;e, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ommon Council, he can make By-Laws, for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e better Government of the City, provided <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ey be not repugnant to the known Laws of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e Realm. So that the Mayor, Aldermen, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d Common Council a&s;&s;embled, are in a man|ner,
<PB N="74" REF="375">an Image of the King, Lords, and Commons convened in Parliament.</P>
<P>If the Citizens be Taxed, 'tis by them&s;elves or their Repre&s;entatives; every Trade having &s;ome of their own Members always of the Council, to &s;ee that nothing be enacted to their Prejudice.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Sheriffs</HI> have al&s;o a good &s;hare in the Government of Cities; as being the proper Judges of Civil Cau&s;es within the &s;ame, and the principal Officers appointed to &s;ee all Executions done, whether Penal or Capi|tal.</P>
<P>As every County of England is divided into Hundreds, &s;o the King's Subjects formerly had Ju&s;tice mini&s;tred to them by Officers of Hun|dreds, called <HI>Bayliffs,</HI> who might hold Plea of Appeal and Approvers. But, in the Reign of Edward III, the&s;e Hundred Courts (certain Franchi&s;es excepted,) were di&s;&s;olved into the County-Courts. Yet there are &s;till divers con|&s;iderable Towns, the chief Magi&s;trates whereof have retained the name of <HI>Bayliff,</HI> as Ip&s;wich, Yarmouth, Colche&s;ter, &amp;c. Where the <HI>Bayliff's</HI> Authority is the &s;ame with the Mayor's in other Places, and they keep Courts accord|ingly.</P>
<P>The Truth is, they differ in nothing but the Name. For the Mayor of London, before the Reign of Richard the Fir&s;t, was called the <HI>Bay|liff</HI> of London. So King John, following the Example of Richard, made the <HI>Bayliff</HI> of Kings Lynn a Mayor, in the year 1204; and Henry V. made the <HI>Bayliff</HI> of Norwich a Mayor, Anno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> 1419.</P>
<PB N="75" REF="375">
<P>But there are others to whom the name of <HI>Bayliff</HI> is &s;till appropriate; as the <HI>Bayliff</HI> of Do|ver Ca&s;tle; that is, the Governour thereof. There be likewi&s;e <HI>Bayliffs</HI> of Mannors, or Hus|bandry; &s;uch as have the Over&s;ight of Under-Servants to private Men of great Sub&s;tance, that &s;et every Man to his Labour and Task, gather the Profits to their Lord and Ma&s;ter, and give him an Account thereof.</P>
<P>The vile&s;t &s;ort of <HI>Bayliffs</HI> to this day are tho&s;e Officers that &s;erve Writs, and Arre&s;t Peo|ple by virtue thereof. And the&s;e are of two Sorts, <HI>Bayliffs Errants,</HI> and <HI>Bayliffs of Franchi|&s;es.</HI> The fir&s;t are &s;uch as the Sheriff makes and appoints to go any where in the County to &s;erve Writs, to &s;ummon the County, Se&s;&s;ions, A&s;&s;izes, and &s;uch like. <HI>Bayliffs of Franchi&s;es</HI> be tho&s;e that are appointed by every Lord of a Mannor, to do &s;uch Offices within his Liberty as the Bayliff Errant doth at large in the Coun|ty.</P>
<P>By <HI>Stewards,</HI> I mean here &s;uch as are Im|ployed by &s;ome Lords of Mannors to hold their Courts, called <HI>Court-Leet,</HI> or <HI>View of Frank|pledge;</HI> the word <HI>Leet</HI> &s;ignifying properly a Law-Day.</P>
<P>This is a Court of Record, not incident to every Mannor; but to tho&s;e only which by &s;pe|cial Grant, or long Pre&s;cription, hold the &s;ame. For 'tis likely Kings did not intru&s;t any with this Power, but &s;uch as they had great Kind|ne&s;s for and Confidence in. To this Court tho&s;e that are within the Homage, and &s;ome|times tho&s;e out of it, are called to Swear Fi|delity to the Prince. Here al&s;o Inquiry is made of Privy Con&s;piracies, Frays, Blood&s;hed, and
<PB N="76" REF="376">Murders. To which was added the Over&s;ight of Mea&s;ures. And what Offences are found, e&s;pecially great ones, ought to be Certified to the Ju&s;tices of A&s;&s;ize, by a Statute made in the Reign of Edward III. For in who&s;e Mannor &s;oever this Court be Kept, it is accounted the King's Court, becau&s;e the Authority thereof originally belongs to the Crown.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, this Court (fir&s;t derived from the Sheriffs Turn) is ordinarily Kept but twice a Year, and that at certain times.</P>
<P>But there is another Court incident to every Mannor, called <HI>Court-Baron,</HI> becau&s;e in ancient times every Lord of a Mannor was &s;tiled Ba|ron.</P>
<P>To this Court are all the Tenants Summoned that belong to the Mannor; where part of the Tenants being Sworn, make a Jury, which is not called the Inque&s;t, but the Homage. Here the Steward &s;its as Judge, and directs the Jury to enquire of &s;uch Things as are proper for this Court. And the&s;e principally Inquire of Copy-holders and Free-holders that be dead &s;ince the la&s;t Court, and bring in their Heirs and next Succe&s;&s;ors. They likewi&s;e Inquire of any Incroachment or Intru&s;ion of Tenants a|gain&s;t the Lord, or among them&s;elves. They al&s;o make Orders and Laws among&s;t them|&s;elves, with a Penalty annexed for Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ors payable to the Lord of the Man|nor.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the&s;e Courts are of great U&s;e for Men that are willing to be ordered by their Neighbours, and who prefer their Quiet and Advantage in Husbandry to the Trouble and Charges of Law-Suits. Otherwi&s;e either Party
<PB N="77" REF="376">may procure a Writ out of a higher Court, to remove the Plea to We&s;tmin&s;ter.</P>
<P>Courts-Baron may be held every three Weeks, or at any longer time, according to the Lords plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>I conclude with <HI>Con&s;tables,</HI> called in &s;ome Places <HI>Headboroughs,</HI> and in others <HI>Tithing-men,</HI> who&s;e Office is only Mini&s;terial. The&s;e Men, &s;ays <HI>Sir Thomas Smith,</HI> were formerly called <HI>Cu&s;todes Pacis,</HI> or Guardians of the Peace, and were in much greater e&s;teem than they be now, who&s;e Power and Authority he &s;uppo&s;es to have been equal with that of the pre&s;ent Ju&s;tices of Peace.</P>
<P><HI>Lambert</HI> looks upon this Office as a Stream of that great Dignity lodged in the Lord High Con&s;table of England. Out of this high Ma|gi&s;tracy, &s;ays he, were drawn tho&s;e lower <HI>Con|&s;tables,</HI> which we call <HI>Con&s;tables of Hundreds and Franchi&s;es.</HI> Fir&s;t ordained by the Statute of Winche&s;ter, 13 <HI>Ed.</HI> I. which appoints for the Con&s;ervation of the Peace, and view of Ar|mour, two Con&s;tables in every Hundred and Franchi&s;e, called in Latine <HI>Con&s;tabularii Capita|les,</HI> in Engli&s;h, High Con&s;tables. And, by rea&s;on of the Increa&s;e both of People and Of|fences, others were made in proce&s;s of time, called <HI>Petty Con&s;tables,</HI> which are of like Nature, but of inferiour Authority to the o|ther.</P>
<P>The Office of a Con&s;table is properly to ap|prehend &s;uch as break the Peace, and common Malefactors, and even Per&s;ons &s;u&s;pected of any Crime, upon a Charge given them, or a War|rant for it from a Ju&s;tice. For a Badge of his Authority, he carries a long Staff painted, with the King's Arms; and, for a Surpri&s;e, &s;ome|times
<PB N="78" REF="377">he u&s;es a &s;hort Staff, which he hides till he thinks it convenient to produce it. The Party apprehended he keeps in his Cu&s;tody, till he can bring him before a Ju&s;tice of Peace; who, upon a &s;trict Examination of the Fact, and hear|ing of the Evidence, commits the Party to Pri&s;on, if he &s;ees cau&s;e, in order to his Trial. Upon which the Con&s;table conducts him to Pri&s;on, and there delivers him to the Goalers Cu&s;tody, with the <HI>Committimus</HI> directed by the Ju&s;tice of Peace to the Jayler. And the Party mu&s;tly in Pri&s;on, till the Ju&s;tices of Peace do meet either at their Quarter-Se&s;&s;ions, or at their Goal-Delivery, when the Pri&s;oners are by Law either condemned, or acquit|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed.</P>
<P>When he is upon Duty, and about to appre|hend one, he may call his Neighbours to aid; and whoever declines to give him a&s;&s;i&s;tance, is liable by Law to Puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>In ca&s;e of Theft, Robbery, or Murder, in a Country Town or Village, and the Malefactor be upon flight, the Con&s;table having notice of it, is to rai&s;e the Pari&s;h in pur&s;uit of him. And this is called <HI>Hue and Cry.</HI> If the Malefactor be not found in the Pari&s;h, the Con&s;table and his A&s;&s;i&s;tants are to go to the next, to get the <HI>Hue and Cry</HI> rai&s;ed there by the Con&s;table of it. In this manner the <HI>Hue and Cry</HI> is carried from Pari&s;h to Pari&s;h, till the Criminal be found. And that Pari&s;h which does not do its Duty, but gives way by its Negligence for the Male|factors E&s;cape, is not only to pay a Fine to the King, but mu&s;t repay to the Party robbed his Damages.</P>
<P>When the Malefactor is taken, he is pre|&s;ently carried by the Con&s;table, or any other by whom he was apprehended, to a Ju&s;tice of
<PB N="79" REF="377">Peace. Who examines the Malefactor, writes the Examination, and (if he do confe&s;s) his Confe&s;&s;ion. Then he binds the Party robbed, or him that &s;ueth, together with the Con&s;table, and &s;o many as can give Evidence again&s;t the Malefactor, to appear at the next Se&s;&s;ions of Goal-Delivery, there to give their Evidence for the King. He binds them in a Recognizance of 10. 20. 30. 40. or 100. <ABBR>l.</ABBR> more or le&s;s, accord|ing to his Di&s;cretion and the quality of the Crime. Which, being certified under his hand, fails not to be levied upon Recognizance, if they fail of being there.</P>
<P>Thus the <HI>Con&s;tables,</HI> which formerly had much the &s;ame Authority as our modern Ju&s;tices of Peace, are now &s;ub&s;ervient to them upon all Occa&s;ions, either to bring the Criminals before them, or to carry them by their Command to the common Pri&s;on. And accordingly this Of|fice does commonly fall into the hands of Trade&s;men and Artificers, and Men of &s;mall experience and ability; who hold it for a Year, there being commonly two of them to each Pari&s;h, cho&s;en by the Ve&s;try. But the harde&s;t part of their Office in London, e&s;pecially is their Watching a Nights, and walking the Rounds in their &s;everal Pari&s;hes. But then they have the chief Command of the Watch; and becau&s;e &s;eldom a greater Power appears a|broad at that time, therefore a Con&s;table came to be called the <HI>King of the Night.</HI></P>

<P>BE&s;ides the publick Ju&s;tice admini&s;tred at four times of the Year in We&s;tmin&s;ter, both for Civil and Criminal Cau&s;es, the Twelve Judges take twice a Year a Progre&s;s in the Country, and exerci&s;e their Judicial Power in the &s;everal Counties the King is plea&s;ed to appoint them for. The Times of the Year fixt for it are pre&s;ently after the end of Hilary-Term, and after the end of Trinity Term; that being called the <HI>Lent,</HI> and this the Summer <HI>A&s;&s;izes.</HI> In relation to which, England is divided into Six Parts, called <HI>Circuits.</HI> Viz.
<LIST>

<ITEM>6. <HI>Northern Circuit,</HI> Comprehending York, Durham, Northumberland, Cumberland, We&s;t|morland, Lanca|&s;ter.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Be&s;ides the two <HI>Circuits</HI> for <HI>Wales,</HI> viz. North and South Wales, for each of which two Ser|geants at Law are appointed.</P>
<P>Now the&s;e Courts are called <HI>A&s;&s;izes,</HI> and the Judges thereof <HI>Ju&s;tices of A&s;&s;ize,</HI> from their Commi&s;&s;ion of <HI>A&s;&s;ize;</HI> by vertue whereof they are to do Right upon Writs called <HI>A&s;&s;izes,</HI> and brought before them by &s;uch as are (or pretend to be) wrongfully thru&s;t out of their Lands. The Writs &s;o called, 1. Becau&s;e they &s;ettle the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and &s;o an outward Right in him that obtaineth by them. 2. Becau&s;e they were originally executed at a certain Time and Place formerly appointed. 3. For that they are tried commonly by &s;pecial Courts appointed for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>But, be&s;ides this Commi&s;&s;ion, there are four others, by which the&s;e Itinerant Judges admi|ni&s;ter Ju&s;tice in the Country. As, the <HI>Com|mi&s;&s;ion to take Ni&s;i-prius,</HI> directed to none
<PB N="82" REF="379">but the Judges them&s;elves, and their Clerks of A&s;&s;izes, by which they are called <HI>Ju&s;tices of Ni&s;i prius.</HI> Which is a common Adjournment of a Cau&s;e in the Common Pleas, to put it off to &s;uch a Day, <HI>Ni&s;i prius Ju&s;ticiarii venerint ad eas Partes ad capiendas A&s;&s;i&s;as,</HI> from which Words <HI>Ni&s;i prius</HI> the Writ came to be called a Writ of <HI>Ni&s;i prius,</HI> the Ju&s;tices, <HI>Ju&s;tices of Ni&s;i prius,</HI> as well as <HI>Ju&s;tices of A&s;&s;ize.</HI> Yet there is this Difference, that as <HI>Ju&s;tices of A&s;&s;ize,</HI> they have Power to give Judgement in a Cau&s;e, whereas <HI>Ju&s;tices of Ni&s;i prius</HI> take only the Ver|dict. Be&s;ides that tho&s;e in a &s;trict &s;en&s;e, med|dle only with the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ory Writs called A&s;&s;ize; but the&s;e do deal in Cau&s;es both real and per&s;o|nal.</P>
<P>Another is a <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion of Peace,</HI> in every County of the Circuit.</P>
<P>But the large&s;t <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion</HI> of all is That of <HI>Oyer and Terminer,</HI> directed to the Judges, and many others of the be&s;t account in their Cir|cuits; but in this Commi&s;&s;ion, the Judges of A&s;&s;ize are of the <HI>Quorum,</HI> &s;o as without them there can be no Proceedings. This Commi&s;&s;ion gives them Power to judge of Trea&s;ons, Mur|ders, and all manner of Felonies and Mi&s;de|meanors.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, they have a <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion of Goal Deli|very,</HI> directed only to them&s;elves, and the Clerk of the A&s;&s;ize a&s;&s;ociate. By which Commi&s;&s;ion they are to deal with every Pri|&s;oner in Goal, for what Offence &s;oever he be there.</P>
<P>Now the&s;e Courts are u&s;ually held at the principal Town of every County, with great pomp, &s;plendour, and fea&s;ting, two Judges being appointed for every Circuit. Then the Sheriff of the County is bound to attend in
<PB N="83" REF="379">per&s;on, with his Under-Officers, the Clerks, Stew|ards of Courts, Bayliffs of Hundreds, Con&s;ta|bles, Jaylors, Sergeants or Beadles, and a gal|lant Train of Servants in rich Liveries, all ri|ding on Hor&s;eback at the Reception of the Judges; whom they wait on and guard, &s;o long as they continue in the County. If the Sheriff cannot come him&s;elf, he mu&s;t depute one to fill up his Place; who is to be allowed by the Judges. The Ju&s;tices of Peace are al&s;o to wait on the Judges. And, if either the Sheriff, or they fail in this part of their Duty, without lawful Impediment, the Judges may &s;et a Fine upon him or them, at their plea&s;ure and di&s;|cretions.</P>
<P>The Di&s;patch of the&s;e Itinerant Judges in the Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice in their &s;everal Cir|cuits is worthy our Ob&s;ervation. For with|in each County all Controver&s;ies grown to I&s;&s;ue in the Courts at London, are commonly deter|mined here in two or three Days. Which is done, not as in forein Countries, by the &s;ole Arbitrement of the Judges, but by a <HI>Jury of Twelve Men</HI> in each County, cho&s;en by the Sheriff thereof, and only directed in point of Law by the Judges. For every Trial by A&s;&s;ize (be the Action civil or criminal, publick or private, per&s;onal or real) is referred for the Fact to a Jury, as it is in mo&s;t Courts of the Com|mon Law; and, as they find it, &s;o pa&s;&s;eth the Judgement.</P>
<P>The Way of Trying Criminals in England being &s;omething &s;ingular and different from o|ther Nations, it will not be improper (after that excellent and mo&s;t ingenious Author, Sir <HI>Thomas Smith</HI>) to &s;hew the Manner of it,
<PB N="84" REF="380">were it but for the &s;atisfaction of Forei|ners.</P>
<P>How Criminals are taken into Cu&s;tody in order to their Trial, and how the &s;ame are In|dited at the Quarter-Se&s;&s;ions, I have already &s;hewed. The Inditement is no definitive Sen|tence, but only <HI>Praejudicium,</HI> or the Opinion the Country has of the Malefactors Ca&s;e. There|fore Men are often Indited in their ab&s;ence. But no Man once Indicted can be delivered without an Arraignment; for as a Jury of Twelve Men have given a Prejudice again&s;t him, &s;o Twelve again mu&s;t acquit or condemn him.</P>
<P>At the A&s;&s;izes the Judges &s;it either in the Town-hou&s;e, or in an open Place, where a Tribunal is &s;et up for Judgement The Judges &s;it in the middle, the principal Ju&s;tices of Peace on each &s;ide of them according to their Degree, and the re&s;t on a lower Bench before the Judges Seat. Something lower a Table is &s;et before them, at which the <HI>Cu&s;tos Rotulorum</HI> or Keeper of Writs, the Under-Sheriff, the E&s;|cheater, and the Clerks do &s;it. Near the Table there is a Bar for the Jury to come in, when they are called; and behind that &s;pace another Bar for the Pri&s;oners to &s;tand at, who are brought thither in Chains.</P>
<P>Then the Cryer crieth, and commandeth Si|lence. One of the Judges makes a &s;hort Speech, wherein he declares (among&s;t other Things) the cau&s;e of their coming. His Speech is no &s;ooner ended, but the Pri&s;oners are called in by Name, and every one mu&s;t an&s;wer to his Name. Then the Keeper of the Writs produces the In|ditements, and the Judges name one, or two, or three of the Pri&s;oners Indited, to proceed upon their Trial.</P>
<PB N="85" REF="380">
<P>The Clerk bids one of them come to the Bar, and hold up his hand. Then he charges him with his Crime, to which he bids him an&s;wer <HI>Guilty,</HI> or <HI>Not Guilty.</HI></P>
<P>If the Pri&s;oner &s;tands mute, and will not an&s;wer, after he has been once or twice &s;o In|terrogated (which happens very &s;eldom,) he is Judged Mute, or Dumb by Con|tumacy; the Puni&s;hment whereof is to be Pre&s;&s;ed to Death, of which more after|wards.</P>
<P>If the Pri&s;oner cries <HI>Guilty,</HI> (which is but &s;eldom too) his Trial is over, and all the Bu|&s;ine&s;s is to pronounce Sentence upon him, ac|cording to Law.</P>
<P>But the common An&s;wer is <HI>Not Guilty,</HI> though the Party be never &s;o apparently Guilty, and his An&s;wer be perhaps contrary to his Confe&s;|&s;ion of the Fact before the Ju&s;tice of Peace by whom he was examined and committed. The Rea&s;on is, becau&s;e he flatters him&s;elf, that he may chance to come off for want of right Evi|dence. For the Law of England is &s;o ten|der of Mens Lives, that unle&s;s the Evidences (which are upon their Oaths) be po&s;itive and clear again&s;t any Pri&s;oner, he may come off.</P>
<P>Upon the Pri&s;oner's pleading <HI>Not Guilty,</HI> the Clerk asketh him, whether he will be Tried by God and the Country. If he an&s;wer <HI>Yes,</HI> the Clerk tells him, he has been <HI>Indited</HI> of &s;uch a <HI>Crime,</HI> &amp;c. That he has pleaded <HI>Not Guilty</HI> to it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd that being asked how he would be Tried, he has an&s;wered <HI>by God and the Country.</HI> Then he tells him of the <HI>Jury</HI> pre&s;ent, that repre&s;ent the Country; and, if he has &s;omething to ob|ject again&s;t any of them, he bids him take a
<PB N="86" REF="381">view of them, and &s;peak, for that he &s;tands upon Life and Death.</P>
<P>Upon this the Jury is Sworn, con&s;i&s;ting of 12 Men at lea&s;t. And, if the Pri&s;oner be a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Stranger, 'tis a Party Jury, con&s;i&s;ting half o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Engli&s;hmen, and half of Foreiners. In ca&s;e the Pri&s;oner has no Exception to make again&s;t any of them, by that time Twelve are Sworn, the&s;e &s;tand to give the Verdict. Whereupon the Crier &s;ays aloud, <HI>If any one can give Evi|dence, or can &s;ay any thing again&s;t the Pri&s;oner, let him come now, for he &s;tands upon his Deli|verance.</HI> If none come in, the Judge doth ask who &s;ent him to Pri&s;on. And, if the Ju|&s;tice of Peace be pre&s;ent who did it, he de|livers up the Examination he took of him, &s;ub&s;cribed by tho&s;e whom he has bound to give Evidence; who, for not appearing, mu&s;t pay their Recognizance. In the mean time the Jury acquit the Pri&s;oner, tho he has con|fe&s;&s;ed the Crime to the Ju&s;tice of Peace.</P>
<P>But, if they come in that are bound to give Evidence, fir&s;t the Ju&s;tices Examination is read; and then the Party robbed (being pre|&s;ent) is &s;worn, next to him the Con&s;table and &s;uch as were with him at the taking of the Pri&s;oner, and at la&s;t as many more as are there to give Evidence. Who are all &s;et in a con|venient place to &s;ee the Judges and Ju&s;tices, the Jury, and the Pri&s;oner, &s;o as to hear them, and to be heard of them all.</P>
<P>The Judge, after they be &s;worn, asketh fir&s;t the Party robbed, if he know the Pri&s;oner, and bids him look upon him. The Party rob|bed &s;ays Yes, and upon that relates the Rob|bery, with all its Circum&s;tances. But the Pri&s;oner &s;tanding &s;till upon the Negative, tho&s;e who were at the Taking of him, or any other
<PB N="87" REF="381">that can Evidence again&s;t him are heard one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fter another.</P>
<P>The Pri&s;oner on the other &s;ide is free to make what Defence he can. And, tho the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing be Party again&s;t him as one that has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">oke his Peace, yet the Judges do freely hear what he can &s;ay for him&s;elf, provided he keep within bounds. But he is allowed no Council, which in Civil and Pecuniary Matters is ne|ver denied; be it for Land, Rent, Right, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, tho he plead again&s;t the King.</P>
<P>When the Judge has heard them all, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sks them if they can &s;ay any more. Upon their &s;ilence he directs the Jury, and bids them di&s;|change their Con&s;ciences. If the Ca&s;e be plain, they con&s;ult together without going from the Bar; and, if they do all agree, the Fore-man of the Jury, in the Name of him&s;elf and the re&s;t, pronounces the Pri&s;oner <HI>Guilty.</HI> If the Ca&s;e requires a Debate, they withdraw into a Room, only with a Copy of the Inditement; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">and there they are to remain by them&s;elves, till they be all agreed on the Verdict, with|out bread, drink, meat, or fire. To which purpo&s;e there is a Bayliff appointed to watch them. If but one of the Jury &s;tands it out again&s;t the re&s;t, he mu&s;t either bring them over to him, or they mu&s;t bring him over to them, before they can &s;tir out of the Room, or have the lea&s;t Refre&s;hment in it. So that it is in the power of one to make all the re&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n a manner Pri&s;oners; and, if he be ob&s;ti|tate, to put them to Inconveniencies for want <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f Nece&s;&s;aries, till he him&s;elf can bear with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hem no longer.</P>
<P>When the Jury have agreed upon the Ver|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ict, they give notice of it to the Bayliff, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ay to be heard. Then the Pri&s;oner being
<PB N="88" REF="382">&s;ent for again to the Bar, each one of the Jury is called in by his Name, and he an&s;wer to it. The Clerk asketh, if they be agreed and who &s;hall &s;peak for them. Which being an&s;wered, the Pri&s;oner is bidden to hold up his hand, to whom the Clerk &s;peaks in the&s;e Words; <HI>Thou art Indited by the Name of</HI> A <HI>of &s;uch a Place,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and being Arraigned Tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> pleade&s;t thereto</HI> Not Guilty; <HI>being Asked how Thou would&s;t be Tried, Thou &s;aid&s;t</HI> By God and the Country; <HI>The&s;e hone&s;t Men were given t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> thee by God and thy Prince for thy Country Hearken what they &s;ay.</HI> Then he asketh of the Jury, <HI>What &s;ay you? Is he Guilty, or No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Guilty?</HI> The Fore-man makes an&s;wer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> one word, <HI>Guilty,</HI> or in two, <HI>Not Guilty.</HI> The fir&s;t is Death to the Pri&s;oner, and the la&s;t Acquits him; for neither the Judges, nor the Ju&s;tice can alter or rever&s;e this Judgment.</P>
<P>Then the Clerk asketh, what Lands or Chat|tels the Pri&s;oner had at the time of the Fe|lony committed. Which is commonly an|&s;wered by the Jury with an <HI>Ignoramus.</HI> But the Sheriff and the E&s;cheator are diligent enough to find it out, both for the Princes and their own Advantage.</P>
<P>Upon this the Judge doth ask the Pri&s;one<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Convicted what he can &s;ay for him&s;elf, why Sentence &s;hould not pa&s;s upon him. If he ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> read never &s;o little, he demands the <HI>Benefit of the Clergy,</HI> an ancient Liberty of the Church, which has been confirmed by divers Parlia|ments. By vertue whereof one in Orders ar|raigned of Felony by a Secular Judge, might pray his Clergy, which was as much as if he prayed to be delivered to his Ordinary, to purge him&s;elf of the Offence objected. But
<PB N="89" REF="382">the ancient Cour&s;e of the Law in this point of Clergy is much altered, &s;o that Lay-men have been made capable of this Benefit in many Ca&s;es; As in Theft of Oxen, Sheep, Mony, and other Things, not forcibly taken to the terrour of the Owner. So favourable is our Law, that for the fir&s;t Fault the Felon &s;hall be admitted to his Clergy. In order to which the Bi&s;hop &s;ends a Clergy-man, with a Com|mi&s;&s;ion under his Seal, to be Judge in that matter at every Goal-Delivery. If the Pri|&s;oner demands to be admitted to his Book, the Judge commonly gives him a P&s;alter, and turns to what place he plea&s;es. The Pri&s;oner reads as well as he can, and it happens mo&s;t times but &s;adly. Then the Judge asketh of the Bi&s;hops Commi&s;&s;ary, <HI>Legit ut Clericus?</HI> To which the Commi&s;&s;ary mu&s;t an&s;wer <HI>Legit,</HI> or <HI>Non legit;</HI> for the&s;e be the formal Words, and our Men of Law are the mo&s;t preci&s;e in their Forms. If he &s;ay <HI>Legit,</HI> the Judge pro|ceeds no further to Sentence of Death. But, if he &s;ay <HI>Non legit,</HI> the Sentence follows either that Day or the next, in the&s;e Words, <HI>Thou</HI> A. <HI>ha&s;t been Indited of</HI> &s;uch <HI>a Felony, and there|fore Arraigned; Thou ha&s;t pleaded</HI> Not Guilty, <HI>and put thy &s;elf upon</HI> God and thy Country; <HI>They have found thee</HI> Guilty, <HI>and Thou ha&s;t no|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hing to &s;ay for thy &s;elf; The Law is, that Thou halt return to the Place from whence thou came&s;t, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd from thence Thou &s;halt go to the Place of Execution, where Thou &s;halt Hang by the Neck <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ill Thou be dead.</HI> Whereupon he charges the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">heriff with the Execution. But he that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">aimeth his Clergy in Ca&s;es where it is ad|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itted is in the pre&s;ence of the Judges burnt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the brawn of his Hand with a hot Iron,

Then he is delivered to the Bi|&s;hops Officer, to be kept in the Bi&s;hops Pri&s;on; from whence, after a certain time, he is deli|vered by a Jury of Clerks. But, if he be taken and found Guilty again, and his Mark di&s;covered, then 'tis his Lot to be hanged.</P>
<P>But he whom the Jury pronounces <HI>Not Guilty</HI> is Acquitted forthwith and Di&s;charged, paying the Jaylor his Fees.</P>
<P>And, as to tho&s;e Pri&s;oners who &s;tand not Indited, but were only &s;ent to Pri&s;on upon Su&s;picion, the Way is to Proclaim 'em fir&s;t in this manner; <HI>A. B.

<P>THE <HI>Court Martial,</HI> otherwi&s;e called <HI>Court of Chivalry,</HI> is the Fountain of Martial Law, and is only held in Time of War, for Martial Di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>The proper <HI>Judges</HI> of this Court are the Lord <HI>High Con&s;table,</HI> and the <HI>Earl Mar&s;hal of England;</HI> which la&s;t is al&s;o to &s;ee Execution <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tone.</P>

<P>The Rhodian Laws were compiled by the Inhabitants of <HI>Rhodes,</HI> a People anciently very powerful at Sea; and who&s;e Maritime Laws were e&s;teemed &s;o ju&s;t and equitable, that the very Romans (&s;o skilful in making of good Laws) referred all Debates and Controver&s;ies in Sea-Affairs to the Judgment of the Rhodian Laws.</P>

<P>FROM the Church Legi&s;lative, I come to the Executive Power, for which there have been &s;everal Courts provided. Among&s;t which is the <HI>Court of Arches,</HI> the chief and mo&s;t ancient Con&s;i&s;tory that belong|eth to the Arch-Bi&s;hop of Canterbury, for the debating of Spiritual Cau&s;es. So called from the arched Church and Tower of <HI>S. Mary le Bow</HI> in Cheap&s;ide London, where this Court is wont to be held. The Judge whereof is called <HI>Dean of the Arches,</HI> or the <HI>Official</HI> of the Court of Arches, becau&s;e with this Officialty is commonly joyned a peculiar Juri&s;diction of 13 Pari&s;hes in London, termed a Deanry, be|ing exempt from the Bi&s;hop of Londons Ju|ri&s;diction, and belonging to the Arch-Bi&s;hop of Canterbury. All Appeals in Church-Mat|ters within the Province of Canterbury are di|rected to this Court. In which the Judge &s;its alone without A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, hearing and de|termining all Cau&s;es without any Jury.</P>
<PB N="101" REF="388">
<P>The <HI>Advocates</HI> allowed to plead in this Court are all to be Doctors of the Civil Law. Who, upon their Petition to the Arch-Bi|&s;hop of Canterbury, and his <HI>Fiat</HI> obtained, are admitted by the Judge of this Court, but mu&s;t not practi&s;e the fir&s;t Year.</P>
<P>Both the Judge and the Advocates always wear their Scarlet Robes, with Hoods lined with Taffety if they be of Oxford, or white Minever Furr if of Cambridge, and all round black Velvet Caps.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the Advocates, here are al&s;o ten <HI>Proctors,</HI> to manage other Mens Cau&s;es. Who wear Hoods lined with Lambs-Skin, if not Graduates; but if Graduates, Hoods proper to the Degree.</P>
<P>According to the Statutes of this Court, all Arguments made by Advocates, and Petitions by the Proctors, are to be made in Latine. All Proce&s;s of this Court runs in the Name of the Judge.</P>
<P>To this Court belong two principal Officers that attend it. Viz. an <HI>Actuary,</HI> who &s;ets down the Judges Decrees, regi&s;ters the Court Acts, and &s;ends them in Books to the Regi&s;try.</P>
<P>Then a <HI>Regi&s;ter,</HI> who&s;e Office is by him&s;elf, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or Deputy, to receive all Libels or Bills, Al|legations, and Exhibits of Witne&s;&s;es, to file all Sentences, and keep the Records of the Court.</P>

<P>All Places and Offices belonging to this Court are in the Arch-Bi&s;hops Gift.</P>
<PB N="102" REF="389">
<P>The <HI>Audience Court</HI> is a Court of equal Au|thority with the Arches, tho inferiour both in Antiquity and Dignity. The Original of this Court was thus. The Arch-Bi&s;hop of Can|terbury heard many Cau&s;es extrajudicially at home in his own Pallace; but, before he would finally determine any thing, he did u&s;ually commit them to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by certain Men learned in the Civil and Canon Laws, who thereupon were called his Auditors, till at la&s;t tho&s;e Cau&s;es were committed to One, thence named <HI>Cau&s;arum Negotiorumque Audi|entiae Cantuarien&s;is Auditor &s;eu Officialis.</HI> And with this Office was joyned heretofore the Arch-Bi&s;hops Chancery, which properly meddles not with any point of contentious Juri&s;di|ction, or deciding of Cau&s;es between Party and Party, but only of Office; as the Grant|ing the Cu&s;tody of the Spiritualities during the Vacation of Bi&s;hopricks, In&s;titution to Benefices, Di&s;pen&s;ing with Banes of Matri|mony, &amp;c. But this is now di&s;tingui&s;hed from the <HI>Audience.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Prerogative Court</HI> is the Court wherein all Wills are proved, and all Admini&s;trations taken, that belong to the Arch Bi&s;hop by his Prerogative; that is, where the Decea&s;ed had Goods of any con&s;iderable value out of the Dioce&s;e wherein he died. And that Value is u&s;ually 5 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> except it be otherwi&s;e by Compo|&s;ition between the Arch-Bi&s;hop and the Bi|&s;hop, as in the Dioce&s;e of London, where it is 10 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> If any Contention ari&s;e between Two or more touching any &s;uch Will or Admini|&s;tration, the Cau&s;e is properly debated and decided in this Court. The Judge whereof is
<PB N="103" REF="389">termed <HI>Judex Curiae Praerogativae Cantuarien&s;is,</HI> the Judge of the Prerogative Court of Can|terbury.</P>
<P>Who is attended in the Court by a <HI>Regi&s;ter,</HI> or his Deputy, who&s;e Office is to &s;et down the Decrees and Acts of the Court, to Keep the Re|cords, all Original Wills and Te&s;taments of Parties decea&s;ed that have left <HI>Bona Not abilia,</HI> &amp;c. His Office is commonly called the <HI>Prerogative Office,</HI> now Kept in the Deans Court near St. Paul's Church-yard; where, for a moderate Fee, one may have a Copy of any &s;uch Te&s;tament. And Under the Regi&s;ter are Six <HI>Clerks,</HI> &s;everally appointed for &s;uch and &s;uch Counties.</P>
<P>This Court, formerly held in the Con&s;i&s;tory of St. Pauls, is now Kept in the Common-Hall at Drs. Commons, next Day after the Ar|ches, in the Afternoon.</P>
<P>All Places belonging to this Court are in his Grace's Gift.</P>
<P>The Archbi&s;hop of York has al&s;o the like Court, which is termed his <HI>Exchequer,</HI> but far inferiour to this in Power and Profit. He has al&s;o an Audience Court.</P>
<P>For Civil Affairs that concern the Church, the highe&s;t Court is the <HI>Court of Delegates.</HI> A Court which con&s;i&s;ts of Commi&s;&s;ioners delega|ted or appointed by the King's Commi&s;&s;ion, to &s;it upon an Appeal to Him in the Court of Chancery, and is granted in three Ca&s;es. Fir&s;t, when a Sentence is given in any Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Cau&s;e by the Archbi&s;hop, or his Official. Se|condly, when any Sentence is given in any Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Cau&s;e in Places exempt. Thirdly, when Sentence is given in the Admiralty in Suits Civil and Marine, by order of the Civil Law.</P>
<PB N="104" REF="390">
<P>The Judges are appointed by the Lord Chan|cellour, under the Great Seal of England, <HI>pro illa vice;</HI> and upon every Cau&s;e or Bu&s;ine&s;s there is a new Commi&s;&s;ion, and new Judges, according to the nature of the Cau&s;e. As &s;ome|times Bi&s;hops, Common-Law Judges, Noble|men, Knights, and Civilians; &s;ometimes Bi|&s;hops, and Civilians; at other times Common Law Judges, and Civilians; and &s;ometimes Ci|vilians only.</P>
<P>This Court is Kept in the &s;ame Place as the former, the next Day after the Prerogative-Court in the Afternoon. Here the Citations and Decrees run in the King's Name, and to this Court belongs a &s;tanding <HI>Regi&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>From this Court lies no Appeal in common Cour&s;e. But the King may (and &s;ometimes does) grant a Commi&s;&s;ion of Review, under the Great Seal.</P>
<P>The <HI>Court of Peculiars</HI> is about certain Pa|ri&s;hes that have Juri&s;diction within them&s;elves for Probate of Wills, &amp;c. being exempt from the Ordinary, and the Bi&s;hops Courts. 'Tis an ancient Priviledge of the See of Canterbury, that where&s;oever any Mannors or Advow&s;ons do belong to it, they forthwith become exempt from the Ordinary, and are reputed <HI>Peculiars.</HI> And there are reckoned in his Province no le&s;s than 57 &s;uch Peculiars. So the King's Chappel is a <HI>Royal Peculiar,</HI> exempt from all Spiritual Juri&s;diction, and re&s;erved to the Vi&s;i|tation and immediate Government of the King him&s;elf, who is &s;upreme Ordinary.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e Courts &s;erving for the whole Province, every Bi&s;hop has his Court held in the Cathedral of his Dioce&s;e. Over which
<PB N="105" REF="390">he hath a <HI>Chancellour,</HI> anciently termed the Church-Lawyer, who being skilled in the Ci|vil and Canon Law, &s;its there as Judge. But, if his Dioce&s;e be large, he has in &s;ome more remote Place a <HI>Commi&s;&s;ary,</HI> who&s;e Authority is only in &s;ome certain Places of the Dioce&s;e, and certain Cau&s;es limited to him by the Bi&s;hop in his Commi&s;&s;ion. The&s;e are called <HI>Con|&s;i&s;tory Courts.</HI></P>
<P>Every Arch-Deacon be&s;ides has his <HI>Court</HI> and Juri&s;diction, where &s;maller Differences a|ri&s;ing within his Limits are pleaded. The Dean and Chapter of every Cathedral or Collegiate Church have al&s;o a <HI>Court,</HI> wherein they take Cognizance of Cau&s;es happening in Places be|longing to the Cathedral.</P>
<P>The proper Matters belonging to Eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal Courts are Ordinations, In&s;titution of Clerks to Benefices, Celebration of Divine Service, Tythes, Oblations, Obventions, Mortuaries, Dilapidations, Reparation of Churches. Rights of Matrimony, Divorces, general Ba&s;tardy, Probate of Wills, Admini&s;trations, Pen&s;ions, Procurations, Commutation of Penance, &amp;c. the Cognizance whereof does not belong to the Common Law. Al&s;o Apo&s;tacy from Chri&s;tia|nity, Simony, Here&s;y, Schi&s;ms, Bla&s;phemy, Fornication, Ince&s;ts, Adulteries.</P>
<P>The Manner of Trials here is different from tho&s;e at Common Law, as thus. Fir&s;t goes forth a <HI>Citation,</HI> then a <HI>Bill and An&s;wer,</HI> after that they proceed to <HI>Proofs, Witne&s;&s;es,</HI> and <HI>Pre|&s;umption,</HI> the Matter being argued <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con,</HI> and the <HI>Canon</HI> and <HI>Civil Laws</HI> quoted. Upon which the definitive <HI>Sentence</HI> of the Judge
<PB N="106" REF="391">pa&s;&s;eth without any Jury, and then <HI>Execution.</HI> follows.</P>
<P>And for Criminal Cau&s;es, they are here tried by <HI>Accu&s;ation,</HI> as when one takes upon him to prove the Crime. Or by <HI>Denunciation,</HI> when the Church-Wardens pre&s;ent, and are not bound to prove, becau&s;e it is pre&s;umed they do it without malice, and that the Crime is noto|rious.</P>

<P>THE City of London is, among&s;t other Things, &s;o remarkable for her tran&s;|cendent Priviledges in Keeping her own Courts of Ju&s;tice, that it will not be im|proper to de&s;cribe 'em here.</P>
<P>I begin with the <HI>Lord Mayor's Court,</HI> which is a Court of Record, held in the Chamber of Guildhall. The Recorder of the City is Judge of this Court; but the Lord Mayor and Alder|men may &s;it as Judges with him, if they plea&s;e. In this Court all manner of Actions may be entred and tried by a Jury, as in other Courts,
<PB N="107" REF="391">for any Debt, Tre&s;pa&s;s, or other Matter what|&s;oever, ari&s;ing within the Liberties of London, and to any value. There are only four Attor|neys belonging to it; and &s;ix Serjeants at Mace, one of them con&s;tantly attending at the Lord Mayor's Hou&s;e, and the re&s;t at the Attorneys Offices.</P>
<P>The Charge of entring an Action in this Court is but 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> be&s;ides the King's Duty. It may be brought to a Trial for 30 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> Charge, and in 14 Days time; the Day for Trials being every Tue&s;day. An Action entred in this Court will remain in force for ever; although no Proceedings; be had thereupon. Whereas an Action entred at either of the Compters dies, and may be cro&s;&s;ed after 16 Weeks.</P>
<P>The Advantages of making Attachments in this Court are con&s;iderable, as you may &s;ee in the Book called <HI>Lex Londinen&s;is,</HI> or the City Law.</P>
<P>The <HI>Court of Aldermen</HI> is a Court of Record, held in the Inner Chamber of Guildhall every Tue&s;day and Thur&s;day, except Holy-days, and in the Time of Se&s;&s;ions of Goal-Delivery. This Court does con&s;tantly appoint the A&s;&s;ize of Bread, determines all Matters touching Lights, Water-cour&s;es, and Party-Walls, and here mu&s;t be &s;ealed all Bonds and Lea&s;es that pa&s;s under the City-Seal.</P>
<P>Several Places are in the Gift of the Lord Mayor and this Court. Viz. The Recorder, Sword-bearer, Four City Coun&s;el, a City Re|membrancer, the Common Hunt. Water-Bay|liff, Cities Sollicitor, Comptroller of the Cham|ber, two Secondaries, Four Attorneys of the Lord Mayor's Court, Clerk of the Chamber, Hall-Keeper, Three Sergeant Carvers, Three

<P>There are other Places in the gift of the Mayor, Aldermen, and Sheriffs; as the City-Carpenter, and other Artificers. But the Rent-Gatherer has been put in by Mr. Chamberlain.</P>
<P>If any Officer (&s;ays <HI>Lex Londinen&s;is</HI>) &s;hall misbehave him&s;elf in his Office, upon Com|plaint made thereof to this Court, and Proof of the Fact, &s;uch Offender may be, and is u&s;u|ally &s;u&s;pended from the Profits of his Place, during the plea&s;ure of this Court.</P>
<P>The Rulers of the Company of Watermen are annually elected and appointed by this Court.</P>
<P>The <HI>Court of Common Council</HI> con&s;i&s;ts of two Orders, as the Parliament of England; viz. the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, which repre&s;ent the Hou&s;e of Lords, and the Common Council Men which repre&s;ent the Hou&s;e of Commons, who&s;e Number amounts to 231, belonging to their re&s;pective Wards, whereof &s;ome have more, &s;ome le&s;s. This Court is held in the
<PB N="109" REF="392">Chamber of Guildhall, at &s;uch Times as the Lord Mayor appoints and directs, being in his Lord&s;hips power to call and di&s;mi&s;s this Court at his plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Several Committees are annually appointed and elected by this Court for the better and more &s;peedy Di&s;patch of the City-Affairs, who make Report to this Court of their Proceedings, as Occa&s;ion requires. Viz. a Committee of 6 Al|dermen and 12 Commoners, for letting and de|mi&s;ing the Cities Lands and Tenements; who u&s;ually meet every Wedne&s;day in the After|noon at Guildhall for that purpo&s;e. A Com|mittee of 4 Aldermen, and 8 Commoners, to let and di&s;po&s;e of the Lands and Tenements given by Sir Tho. Gre&s;ham, who u&s;ually meet at Mercer's Hall, at &s;uch Times as the Lord Mayor for the time being directs and appoints; and the Lord Mayor him&s;elf is commonly cho|&s;en one of this Committee.</P>
<P>This Court does al&s;o annually elect Com|mi&s;&s;ioners for the Sewers, and Pavements. And by this Court are annually elected a Governour, Deputy-Governour, and A&s;&s;i&s;tants, for the Ma|nagement of the Cities Lands in Ul&s;ter in Ire|land.</P>
<P>A Stranger born may be made free of this City by Order of this Court, and not other|wi&s;e. The Places of Common Serjeant, Town-Clerk, and Common Crier, are in the Gift of this Court. The Judges of the Sheriffs Court have &s;ometimes been elected by this Court, and &s;ometimes by the Court of Alder|men.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hu&s;tings</HI> is a very ancient Court of Re|cord, always held in Guildhall, and commonly every Tue&s;day, before the Lord Mayor and
<PB N="110" REF="393">Sheriffs of London for the time being. When any Matter is to be argued or tried in this Court, Mr. Recorder &s;its as Judge with the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs, and gives Rules and Judgement therein. And, though the Original Writ be directed to the Mayor and Sheriffs joyntly, yet the&s;e by Commandment of the Lord Mayor, are Mini&s;ters to execute all Pro|ce&s;s out of this Court.</P>
<P>In this Court Deeds may be Inrolled, Reco|veries pa&s;&s;ed, Wills proved; and Replevins, Writs of Error, Right, Patent, Wa&s;te, Parti|tion, and Dower may be determined for any Matters within the City of London, and the Liberties thereof.</P>
<P>The Attorneys of the Lord Mayor's Court are Attorneys al&s;o in this Court; and the &s;e|cond Attorney is always Clerk of the Inroll|ments, and Inrolls all Deeds brought for that purpo&s;e. Now a Deed Inrolled in the <HI>Hu&s;tings</HI> is counted as good as a Fine at Common Law; for that it bars the Wife from claiming her Dower.</P>
<P>In this Court al&s;o the Burge&s;&s;es to &s;erve for the City in Parliament are elected by the Live|ry-men of the re&s;pective Companies, which is done after this manner, in the pre&s;ence of the Court. Fir&s;t, the Lord Mayor and Aldermen are put up (according to ancient Cu&s;tom) for Candidates, and after them are u&s;ually nomina|ted four Commoners. And out of them all, the four that have the plurality of Voices are declared by the Sheriffs to be duly cho&s;en. But, if there be any Conte&s;t about the Election, it is u&s;ually decided by a Poll.</P>
<P>The <HI>Court of Goal Delivery</HI> is u&s;ually held 8 times a Year at the Old-Baily, both for the Ci|ty
<PB N="111" REF="393">of London and County of Middle&s;ex, for the Trial of Criminals. The Lord Mayor is the chief Judge of this Court, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;ome of the Judges, be&s;ides the Recorder, and the two Sheriffs. He has the Power of Reprieving condemned Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>The <HI>Two Sheriffs Courts</HI> are held in Guild|hall, the one by one Sheriff, every Wedne&s;day and Friday, for Actions entred at the Wood|&s;treet Compter, the other by the other Sheriff, every Thur&s;day and Saturday, for Actions entred at the Poultry Compter.</P>
<P>To the&s;e Courts belong 8 Attorneys, who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s here is not to keep any Record, but only to a&s;&s;i&s;t their Clients, and take their Fees due to them in every Cau&s;e. Two Secondaries, who allow and return all Writs brought to re|move Cau&s;es out of the&s;e Courts. Two Clerks of the Papers, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s is to draw the Subpoenas for Witne&s;&s;es to appear, and to file and copy all Declarations upon Actions in the&s;e Courts. Two Protonotaries, who draw and ingro&s;s all &s;uch Declarations. Eight Clerk-&s;it|ters, who enter Actions and Attachments, and take Bails and Verdicts.</P>
<P>In the&s;e Courts may be tried Actions of Debt, Ca&s;e, Tre&s;pa&s;s, Accompt and Covenants broken, Attachments, and Seque&s;trations. And, if ei|ther Party &s;hall have a Witne&s;s that cannot &s;tay in London till the Day of Trial, his Te&s;timony may be taken in writing, which will be allow|ed as good Evidence.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Chamberlain's Court,</HI> or <HI>Office,</HI> 'tis Kept in the Chamber of Guildhall. As he is intru&s;ted with the Cities Ca&s;h, and the Orphans Mony, &s;o when he takes this Office upon him,
<PB N="112" REF="394">he mu&s;t give good Security to the Court of Aldermen; and he is accountable to Auditors appointed and cho&s;en for that purpo&s;e. To him belongs the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Apprentices, over whom he has a great Authority. There|fore he attends at Guildhall u&s;ually every Forenoon, to Inroll and turn over Ap|prentices, and to make &s;uch Free as have duly &s;erved the full Term of 7 Years, and have not married nor taken Wages in that Time.</P>
<P>When any Difference happens betwixt a Ma|&s;ter and his Apprentice, the mo&s;t prudential Way is to refer the matter before the Cham|berlain, who will freely hear both Parties, and decide the Controver&s;y for 3 Shill. Charge, viz. 1 Shill. to the Officer for the Summons, and 2 Shill. to the Clerk for the Order. Whereas, if they proceed at Law for Relief, it may co&s;t both Parties five or &s;ix pounds in Charges; and the Conclu&s;ion may be le&s;s &s;atisfactory, than if decided by &s;uch Reference as afore|&s;aid.</P>
<P>If an Apprentice &s;hall be unruly or di&s;order|ly in his Ma&s;ter's Hou&s;e, or commit any noto|rious Fault, Mr. Chamberlain (upon Complaint made thereof) will &s;end one of his Officers for &s;uch Apprentice, and &s;end him to Bridewell, or puni&s;h him otherwi&s;e, according to the nature of the Offence.</P>
<P>And, if any Ma&s;ter &s;hall mi&s;u&s;e his Ap|prentice, by beating him unrea&s;onably, or with unlawful Weapons, or by neglecting to in&s;truct him, or to find him Nece&s;&s;aries, Mr. Chamberlain (upon Complaint thereof made) will &s;end a Summons for the Ma&s;ter to appear before him; and upon hearing both Parties, will relieve the Apprentice, or leave him to
<PB N="113" REF="394">take his Remedy again&s;t his Ma&s;ter in the Lord Mayor's Court. And, if the Ma&s;ter &s;hall refu&s;e to appear before the Chamberlain being duly Summoned, My Lord Mayor, or Mr. Re|corder (upon Complaint made thereof) will grant a Warrant to apprehend &s;uch Freeman, and compel him to appear.</P>
<P>When an Apprentice is, by Con&s;ent of his Ma&s;ter, to be turned over to another Ma&s;ter of the &s;ame Trade, it mu&s;t be done fir&s;t before the Company where he was bound, and then before the Chamberlain. For hereby the fir&s;t Ma&s;ter is di&s;charged from him, and the &s;econd obliged to keep him, as the Apprentice on his &s;ide is obliged to &s;erve him the full Term of the Indentures. Other|wi&s;e there is no Obligation upon the &s;econd Ma&s;ter to Keep &s;uch Apprentice, nor upon this to &s;erve him, &s;o that the Apprentice may &s;ue out his Indenture again&s;t his fir&s;t Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>If any Ma&s;ter &s;hall refu&s;e to make his Ap|prentice free when the Term in his Indenture <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> expired, upon Complaint thereof made, Mr. Chamberlain will cau&s;e the Ma&s;ter to be Sum|moned before him; and, if he cannot &s;hew good Cau&s;e to the contrary, will make the Ap|prentice free.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, if any Freeman, to make an Appren|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ice Free of London, do te&s;tify, that he has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eally &s;erved him the full Term of 7.

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the Orphans Court, the Court of Con&s;cience</HI> or <HI>Reque&s;ts, the Court for the Con&s;ervation of the River, and the Pie-powder Court.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE <HI>Orphans Court</HI> is held before the Mayor and Aldermen, who are Guar|dians to the Children of all Freemen of London, that are or &s;hall be under the Age of 21 Years at the time of their Father's De|cea&s;e. This Court meets at Guildhall but once a Year, viz. on the Munday morning after Mid|lent Sunday, which is termed Call-Day. For then they meet purpo&s;ely to hear the Name called over of all the Securities that &s;tand bound for Orphans Portions; and upon that Day on of every of the Sureties ought to appear to give an Account, whether the other Securi|ties are living, and in good Condition, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> whether the Orphans are living and mar|ried.</P>
<P>If none of the Securities appear upon th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Day, they forfeit their Bonds and Recogn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|zances. Then the Clerk of this Court (wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is always the younge&s;t Attorney in the Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Mayor's Court) makes out Proce&s;s again&s;t the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="115" REF="395">forces 'em to an Account, and they mu&s;t pay the Charges of the Proce&s;s.</P>
<P>But, that you may Know more fully how this great Concern of the Orphans is managed for their benefit, and what Care is taken of their Welfare, I &s;hall make bold to inlarge a little upon this Subject, out of <HI>Lex Londinen|&s;is.</HI></P>
<P>When a Freeman of London dies, leaving Children under Age, the Clerks of the re&s;pec|tive Pari&s;hes within the Bill of Mortality ought to give the Name of &s;uch Freeman to the com|mon Crier of the City. Who is thereupon to &s;ummon the Widow or Executor of &s;uch Free|man to appear before the Court of Aldermen, there to be bound to bring in an Inventory of the Te&s;tator's E&s;tate, within the &s;pace of two Months. And, that the Inventory may be given in due time, the Court of Aldermen have made an Order, not to allow any finding Mony (or Intere&s;t) for any Mony that &s;hall be paid into the Chamber of London by any Executor or Ad|mini&s;trator belonging to any Freemans E&s;tate, until &s;uch time as the Executor or Admini|&s;trator do bring in and exhibit upon Oath a true and perfect Inventory to the be&s;t of his Knowledge.</P>
<P>If the Party &s;ummoned do not appear, the Lord Mayor &s;ends his Warrant, and forces an Appearance. And, if any Executor re|&s;u&s;e to become bound to bring in an In|ventory, the Court of Aldermen have power to &s;end him to Newgate, there to remain till <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he &s;ubmit; and the Courts at We&s;tmin&s;ter will not relea&s;e &s;uch Per&s;on.</P>
<P>After the Bond given, the Executor mu&s;t procure 4 Freemen to apprai&s;e the Te&s;tator's Goods. In order to which he mu&s;t cau&s;e them
<PB N="116" REF="396">to appear before a Ju&s;tice of Peace in Lon|don, and take their Oaths, that they &s;hall make a ju&s;t and true Valuation and Apprai&s;e|ment of the Goods and Chattels of the Decea|&s;ed, according to the be&s;t of their Judgements and Skills.</P>
<P>When the Apprai&s;ement is to be made, the Common Crier is to have notice of it before|hand, being appointed by the Court of Alder|men to &s;ee the &s;ame be fairly done, and to the be&s;t advantage of the Orphan. And, un|le&s;s the Common Crier, or his Deputy be pre&s;ent, and the Inventory &s;igned by the Com|mon Crier, the Court of Aldermen will not al|low thereof.</P>
<P>The Apprai&s;ement being made as afore&s;aid, and &s;igned by the Common Crier and the Ap|prai&s;ers, it mu&s;t be given to the Common Ser|geant of the City, or one of his Clerks, at his Office in Guildhall-Yard; he being the only Per&s;on intru&s;ted by the Court of Aldermen, to take all Inventories and Accounts of Freement E&s;tates. If he approves thereof, he will cau&s;e it to be Ingro&s;&s;ed, and a Duplicate of it to be made for the Executor or Admini&s;trator. And, when the &s;ame is examined by him, and his hand &s;et thereto in te&s;timony thereof, the Exe|cutor or Admini&s;trator mu&s;t in the Court of Aldermen &s;wear the &s;ame Inventory to be a true Inventory of the Goods and Chattels of the Party decea&s;ed, according to the be&s;t of his Knowledge.</P>
<P>When the Inventory is &s;o exhibited, the Executor mu&s;t become bound in a con&s;iderable Penalty, either to bring in the Mony that &s;hall appear due to the Orphans by the Inventory, or within two Months to give good Security to pay the &s;ame into the Chamber of London for
<PB N="117" REF="396">the U&s;e of the Orphans, when they &s;hall come to Age, or be married.</P>
<P>If the Executor pay the Mony into the Chamber of London, the Court of Aldermen u&s;ually allow five <HI>per Cent</HI> Intere&s;t for &s;o much Mony of the Te&s;tator's E&s;tate as is due to the Orphans by the Cu&s;tom of London, &s;o as the &s;ame exceed not 500 <ABBR><HI>l;</HI></ABBR> and for Legacy-mony, 3 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> 6 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 8. <ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> per Cent.</P>
<P>But, if the Executor &s;hall not think fit to pay the Mony into the Chamber, he mu&s;t become bound with 3 Sureties to the Chamberlain of London for the time being in one or more Re|cognizances, or el&s;e by Bond to pay the Mony due to Orphans. And, in ca&s;e the Security live within the Liberties of London, they mu&s;t be bound by Bond.</P>
<P>Now, as to Recognizances, the Cu&s;tom is ne|ver to make any touching Orphans of greater Penalty than 400 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> and not for the Payment of above 300. Therefore, if the Sum (for Example) be 900 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> the Security mu&s;t become bound by 3 Recognizances, each for the Pay|ment of 300 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P>If a Freeman leaves Lands and Tenements to his Children, the Executor mu&s;t become bound with Sureties to account for the Rents and Profits thereof.</P>
<P>The Securities mu&s;t take particular care that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">one of the Orphans marry, or be put Appren|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ice with their Con&s;ents, without the Leave of the Court of Aldermen fir&s;t obtained for that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">urpo&s;e. And as the Orphan comes to be of the Age of 21 Years, or to be married with the Con&s;ent of the Court of Aldermen, the Se|curities mu&s;t take care to bring him to Guildhall, with a per&s;on to prove his Age. Then the Or|phan mu&s;t acknowledge &s;atisfaction for the Mo|ny
<PB N="118" REF="397">due to him, or her, of the Te&s;tator's E|&s;tate, which mu&s;t be done in the Court of Al|dermen. And, upon Motion made by Mr. Common Sergeant, the Court does order, that all Bonds entered into for the Payment of &s;uch Orphan's Portion, &s;hall be delivered up, and cancelled. And, if the Security became bound by Recognizances, the Clerk of the Or|phans will cro&s;s and di&s;charge &s;uch Recogni|zances.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the Puni&s;hments inflicted on Malefactors.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the 9th Chapter of this Part I have &s;hewn at large the Manner of Trying Criminals in England; wherein is to be commended our Engli&s;h Humanity towards Pri&s;oners that are upon their Trial. When other Nations, under pretence that no Man ought to be put to Death but upon his own Confe&s;&s;ion of the Crime he &s;tands charged with, have devi&s;ed &s;uch <HI>racking Tortures</HI> to extort the Confe&s;&s;ion, as make often the Innocent cry Guilty, and prefer Death to the Rack. But this I have al|ready toucht upon in my fir&s;t Part.</P>
<P>My Bu&s;ine&s;s is now to &s;peak of the Puni&s;h|ments inflicted here upon Criminals of what nature &s;oever.</P>
<P><HI>Hanging</HI> is the u&s;ual Puni&s;hment to Death in England, either for High Trea&s;on, Petty Trea|&s;on, or Felony. But the Manner is different.</P>
<P>For a Traytor to the King and Govern|ment is to be drawn upon a Hurdle or Sledge to the Gallows, and there to be hanged by the Neck. But then he is pre&s;ently cut down <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">live, his Entrals pulled out of his Belly and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">urnt before his Face, his Head cut off, and his Body divided into four Parts, and both the Head and Body hung up or impaled where the King &s;hall command.</P>
<PB N="126" REF="401">
<P>This Puni&s;hment indeed, con&s;idering all its Circum&s;tances, &s;eems cruel to &s;uch as do not narrowly con&s;ider the nature of the Crime. Whereas the Law thinks it but rea&s;onable, that who&s;oever indeavours to cut off the King, or rend the Government, &s;hould be him&s;elf cut off and rent, as before &s;aid.</P>
<P>As for his Lands and Goods, they are for|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eited to the King; his Wife, if married, lo&s;es her Dower; and, if he be Noble, his Children lo&s;e their Right of Nobility, a&s;well as Inheritance. For, by the Law, Trea&s;on taints the Bloud.</P>
<P>But it is ob&s;ervable, as to the Kings Per&s;on, that it is not only downright killing (or mur|dering) the King which makes it High Trea&s;on. For the very imagining (or contriving) his Death, without any overt Act, is High Trea|&s;on.</P>
<P>Fal&s;ifying and Clipping of Mony is al&s;o <HI>High Trea&s;on,</HI> by Law. But the Offender's Puni&s;h|ment is only to be Drawn, and Hanged by the Neck, till he be dead.</P>
<P>The &s;ame it is with one guilty of <HI>Petty Trea&s;on,</HI> as when a Servant kills his Ma&s;ter or Mi&s;tris, a Wife her Husband, or a Clergy-man his Prelate, to whom he ow's Obedience.</P>
<P>For <HI>Felony,</HI> as Murder, Theft or Robbery, and other Capital Crimes, for which anciently there were &s;everal &s;orts of Puni&s;hments, the Malefactor is but Hanged, &s;ince the Reign of Henry I.</P>
<P>But, when the Robbery is attended with Murder, the Criminal, after he is hanged and dead, is taken down to be hanged in Chains; and &s;o to hang <HI>in terrorem</HI> till the Body be quite rotted off, or eaten up by the Birds of the Air.</P>
<PB N="127" REF="401">
<P>As to Per&s;ons of great Birth and Quality, convicted of High Trea&s;on, Petty Trea&s;on, or Felony, tho the Judgment be the &s;ame with that of common Per&s;ons, yet by the Kings Fa|vour they are u&s;ually <HI>Beheaded.</HI> Which is performed with an Ax, upon a Block lying on the Scaffold; and not as in other Countries, by a Sword, kneeling or &s;tanding.</P>
<P>The Notion of Murder, as a Capital Crime, invites me to explain two Law-Terms relating to it, viz. <HI>Man&s;laughter</HI> and <HI>Chance-medley.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Man&s;laughter</HI> is the unlawful killing of one without prepen&s;ed Malice. As when two, that formerly meant no harm one to another, meet together; and falling out upon &s;ome &s;udden Occa&s;ion, the one kills the other. It differs from <HI>Murder,</HI> becau&s;e it is not done with fore-going Malice; and from <HI>Chance|medley,</HI> becau&s;e it has a pre&s;ent Intent to kill. 'Tis Felony, but it is allowed the Bene&s;it of the Clergy for the fir&s;t time.</P>
<P><HI>Chance-medley,</HI> otherwi&s;e called Man&s;laughter by Mi&s;adventure, &s;ignifies the ca&s;ual Killing of a Man, not altogether without the Killer's Fault, though without an evil Intent; for which the Offender &s;hall have his Pardon of cour&s;e. But here mu&s;t be con&s;idered, whether the Offender, when he committed this Man|&s;laughter by Chance-medley, was doing a law|ful Thing. For, if the Act were unlawful, it is Felony. As if two are fighting together, and a third Man comes to part them, and is killed by one of the two, without any Malice fore-thought, or evil Intent in him that killed the Man, yet this is Murder in him, and not Man&s;laughter by Chance-medley or Mi&s;ad|venture, becau&s;e they two that fought toge|ther were doing an unlawful Act. And, if
<PB N="128" REF="402">they were met with prepen&s;ed Malice, the one intending to kill the other, then it is Murder in them both.</P>
<P><HI>Burning alive</HI> is &s;ometimes u&s;ed, but only for Witches, and Women convicted of High Trea|&s;on, or Petty Trea&s;on.</P>
<P>In the Time of Popery, e&s;pecially in the Reign of Queen Mary, this was the proper Puni&s;hment for Hereticks, that is, in the Po|pi&s;h Sen&s;e, for Prote&s;tants. When the Pa|pi&s;ts, who ever delighted in humane Sacrifices, made Bonefires of them, and re&s;erved Hell-fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e for them&s;elves.</P>
<P><HI>Pre&s;&s;ing to Death,</HI> called by the Law <HI>Peine forte &amp; dure,</HI> is a Puni&s;hment for tho&s;e only that being Arraigned either of Petty Trea&s;on or Felony, refu&s;e to An&s;wer, or to put them|&s;elves upon the ordinary Trial of God and the Country. Which by the Law is called <HI>to &s;tand Mute.</HI> And for this Contumacy the Of|fender is to be &s;ent back to the Pri&s;on whence he came, there to be laid in &s;ome low dark Room, all naked but his privy Members, his Back upon the bare Ground, his Arms and Legs &s;tretched with Cords fa&s;tened to the &s;e|veral Quarters of the Room. Then is laid up|on his Body Iron and Stone as much as he may bear, or more. The next Day he &s;hall have three mor&s;els of Barley-bread without Drink; and the Day after he &s;hall have for his Drink as much of the next Water to the Pri&s;on as he can drink three &s;everal times, except it be running Water, and that with|out any bread. And this is to be his Diet, till he Die. Which grievous kind of Death &s;ome &s;tout Men have cho&s;en, to &s;ave their
<PB N="129" REF="402">E&s;tates to their Children, and keep their Bloud from being &s;tained. But, in ca&s;e of High Trea&s;on, though the Criminal &s;tand mute, yet Judgment &s;hall be given again&s;t him as if he had been Convicted, and his E&s;tate &s;hall be Confi&s;cated.</P>
<P>In many Parts beyond Sea the Criminals hanged or beheaded are denied <HI>Chri&s;tian Burial,</HI> their Society being declined in the Grave who were not fit to live in the World. In England, where they are charitably lookt up|on as reconciled to God upon their penitent Departure out of this World, their Friends are allowed to inter them decently where they think fit. He therefore that has Friends to look to his Burial go's to the Place of Execu|tion, his Coffin in the Cart with him, a good <HI>Memento Mori.</HI> And, after he has hanged about a quarter of an hour, he is cut down, laid in his Coffin, and conveyed in a Coach to the Place from whence he is de&s;igned to be buried. But <HI>Apo&s;tates, Hereticks,</HI> and <HI>Extor|&s;ioners,</HI> all <HI>perjured</HI> Per&s;ons, and &s;uch as die <HI>Excommunicate,</HI> al&s;o any one that is <HI>Felo de &s;e,</HI> or that has wittingly made him&s;elf away, all &s;uch are by Law denied <HI>Chri&s;tian Burial.</HI> And &s;o are for the mo&s;t part Men that die for <HI>High Trea&s;on,</HI> and <HI>Robbers</HI> guilty of Murder.</P>
<P>For <HI>Petty Larceny,</HI> or &s;mall Theft, that is under the ancient value of 12 d. the Puni&s;h|ment &s;ince Edward III. is by <HI>Whipping,</HI> and in the late Reigns has been often by Tran&s;porta|tion into the We&s;t-Indies, where they live for &s;ome Years a &s;lavi&s;h Life. But, if the Of|&s;ender be found by the Jury to have fled for the &s;ame, he forfeits all his Goods.</P>
<PB N="130" REF="403">
<P>For <HI>Mi&s;pri&s;ion of High-Trea&s;on,</HI> that is, for neglecting or concealing it, the Offender's Pu|ni&s;hment is Forfeiture of the Profits of his Lands during Life, and of all his Goods, be|&s;ides Impri&s;onment for Life.</P>
<P><HI>Perjury,</HI> whereby Mens E&s;tates, Reputation, and Lives ly at &s;take, is commonly puni&s;hed only with the <HI>Pillory;</HI> never with Death, though it has co&s;t the Lives of many. 'Tis true a Per|jurer Convict is by Law incapable of being a Witne&s;s, or Admini&s;trator, or of bearing any publick Office. And, in the &s;trictne&s;s of the Law, he ought to be burnt in the forehead with a P, his Goods to be Confi&s;cated, and his Trees growing upon his Ground rooted up.</P>
<P>But all this is counted too little by tho&s;e Nations where wilful Perjury is puni&s;hed with Death. At lea&s;t it &s;eems but equi|table, which is the Practice of Spain, that the Perjurer &s;hould &s;uffer the &s;ame Puni&s;h|ment which he intended for another by his Perjury.</P>
<P><HI>Forgery, Bla&s;phemy, Cheating, Libelling, Fal&s;e Weights and Mea&s;ures, Fore&s;talling the Market, Offences in Baking and Brewing,</HI> are al&s;o puni&s;h|ed with &s;tanding in the <HI>Pillory.</HI> But &s;ometimes the Offender is Sentenced be&s;ides to have one or both Ears nailed to the Pillory and cut off, or his Tongue there bored through with a hot Iron.</P>
<P>For <HI>Striking in the Kings Court, &s;o as to draw Bloud,</HI> the Criminal is to have his right Hand cut off in a mo&s;t &s;olemn manner. And for <HI>Striking in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall,</HI> whil&s;t the Courts of Ju&s;tice are there &s;itting, the Offender is im|pri&s;oned during Life, and all his E&s;tate for|feited.</P>
<PB N="131" REF="403">
<P>For one found in a <HI>Praemunire,</HI> that is, one who incurs the &s;ame Puni&s;hment which was inflicted on tho&s;e who tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the Statute of Rich. II. commonly called the <HI>Statute of Prae|munire</HI> (which Statute was properly made a|gain&s;t &s;uch as avouched the Popes pretended Right of be&s;towing by Provi&s;ion mo&s;t of the be&s;t Livings in England, by Mandates,) the Puni&s;hment is Forfeiture of all his E&s;tate, to be put out of the King's Protection, and Impri|&s;oned during the King's Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><HI>Vagabonds,</HI> and the like, who can give no good account of them&s;elves, are puni&s;hed by &s;etting their Legs in the <HI>Stocks</HI> for certain hours. And <HI>Scolding Women</HI> (that are always teazing their Neighbours) by being &s;et in a <HI>Cucking Stool</HI> placed over &s;ome deep Water and duck'd therein three &s;everal times, to cool their heat and choler.</P>
<P>Other <HI>Mi&s;demeanours</HI> are commonly puni&s;hed with <HI>Impri&s;onment</HI> or <HI>Fines,</HI> and &s;ometimes with both.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e are the <HI>Corporal Puni&s;hments</HI> common|ly u&s;ed in England for Criminals that happen to fail into the hands of Ju&s;tice. But there are al&s;o Spiritual Puni&s;hments, &s;uch as concern the Soul e&s;pecially, and are in the power of the Spiritual Courts. 'Tis true they are but &s;eldom put into practice, but let us &s;ee however what the Law is in this point.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, for refu&s;ing to appear in the Eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal Court upon Summons, or for not obeying the Orders of the Court, the Party Delinquent is admoni&s;hed. If he &s;light the Admonition, then comes upon him <HI>Minor Excommunicatio,</HI> the Le&s;&s;er Excommunication, whereby he is Excommunicated, or excluded from the Church;
<PB N="132" REF="404">if not from the Church, at lea&s;t from the Com|munion of the Lords Supper. And by this le&s;&s;er Excommunication, he is di&s;inabled to be Plaintiff in a Law-&s;uit, &amp;c. Which Power of Excommunication the Bi&s;hop may dele|gate to any grave Prie&s;t with the Chancel|lour.</P>
<P>But for Here&s;y, Ince&s;t, Adultery, Perjury, and other grievous Crimes, <HI>Excommunicatio ma|jor,</HI> or the greater Excommunication, is u&s;ed, and pronounced by the Bi&s;hop him&s;elf in per&s;on. Now this is not only an Exclu&s;ion from the Com|pany of Chri&s;tians in Spiritual Duties, but al&s;o in Temporal Concerns. For a Per&s;on &s;o ex|communicated cannot in any Civil or Eccle|&s;ia&s;tical Court be Plantiff, or Witne&s;s. And, if he continue 40 Days Excommunicated, with|out acknowledging and giving &s;atisfaction for his Offence, the Chancery grants the King's Writ again&s;t him, <HI>De Excommunicato capiendo,</HI> to take him up and ca&s;t him into Pri&s;on, with|out Bail; where he is to ly, till he has fully &s;atisfied for his Offence.</P>
<P>Then comes the <HI>Anathema,</HI> but this is only inflicted upon an ob&s;tinate Heretick. Where|by he is declared a publick Enemy of God, cur&s;ed, and delivered over to eternal Damna|tion. And this is to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">one by the Bi&s;hop him|&s;elf in Per&s;on, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Dean and Chap|ter, or twelve other grave Prie&s;ts.</P>
<P>Sometimes the Delinquent is compelled to make a publick Confe&s;&s;ion of his Fault, and to bewail it in the Church before the whole Con|gregation. Now this is called a <HI>publick Penance,</HI> and the Manner of it is thus. The Delinquent is to &s;tand in the Church-porch upon a Sunday, bare-headed and bare-footed, in a white Sheet, and with a white Rod in his hand. Having
<PB N="133" REF="404">there bewailed him&s;elf, and begged every one that pa&s;&s;es by to pray for him, he enters the Church, falling down, and Ki&s;&s;ing the Ground. Then he is placed in the middle of the Church in a con&s;picuous Place over again&s;t the Mini|&s;ter. Who makes a Di&s;cour&s;e upon the foul|ne&s;s of his Crime, and having received his humble Acknowledgement of the &s;ame, and his &s;olemn Promi&s;e with God's help and a&s;|&s;i&s;tance to watch more carefully for the time to come again&s;t the Temptations of the World, the Fle&s;h, and the Devil, pronounces in Chri&s;t's Name the Ab&s;olution. The Penitent on his &s;ide humbly be&s;eeches the Congregation to par|don him, and receive him into their holy Com|munion, and in te&s;timony thereof to vouch|&s;afe out of their Chri&s;tian Charity, to &s;ay with him aloud the Lord's Prayer. Which &s;eems to be the Way u&s;ed by the Primitive Churches.</P>
<P>But, when the Crime is not notorious and publick, the fore&s;aid Pennance may, by the Ca|nons of the Church, be commuted (at the Par|ties Reque&s;t) into a <HI>Pecuniary Mulct,</HI> for the Poor of the Pari&s;h, or &s;ome pious U&s;es; Pro|vided that it may appear to be the more pro|ble Way for the Delinquents Reformation. Such is the Temper of &s;ome Men that, far from being likely to be reclaimed by a publication of their Offence, they will rather grow obdu|rate and impudent, when they perceive their Reputation to be lo&s;t.</P>
<P>To all the fore&s;aid Puni&s;hments and Cen&s;ures of the Church both the Laity and Clergy are &s;ubject. But there are other Puni&s;hments to which the faulty Clergy only are liable, which are four in Number; commonly called <HI>Su&s;|pen&s;io
<PB N="134" REF="405">ab Officio, Su&s;pen&s;io a Beneficio, Deprivatio a Beneficio,</HI> and <HI>Deprivatio ab Officio.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> is, when a Mini&s;ter for a time is de|clared unfit to execute his Office. The <HI>&s;econd,</HI> when he is for &s;ome time deprived of the Pro|fits of his Benefice. Both which are wont to be for &s;maller Crimes.</P>
<P><HI>Deprivatio a Beneficio,</HI> is when a Mini&s;ter, for a greater Crime, is wholly, and for ever deprived of his Living. And the <HI>la&s;t</HI> is, when he is wholly and for ever deprived of his Or|ders; which is properly called in Engli&s;h a De|po&s;ing, or Degradation.</P>
<P>This is commonly for &s;ome hainous, or Ca|pital Crime. And then the Mini&s;ter is &s;olemn|ly &s;tript by the Bi&s;hop of his Prie&s;tly Ve&s;tments in the pre&s;ence of the Civil Magi&s;trate, to whom he is then delivered to be Puni&s;hed as a Lay-man for the like Offence.</P>
