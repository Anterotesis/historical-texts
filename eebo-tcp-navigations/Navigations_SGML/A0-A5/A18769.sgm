<HEAD>&leaf;To the Queenes most Excellent Maiestie, Elizabeth, by the grace of God, Queene of England, Fraunce and Ireland, &amp;c. Thomas Church|yard wisheth alwayes blessednes, good fortune, victorie, and worldly honour, with the encrease of quiet raigne, vertuous lyfe, and most Princely gouernment.</HEAD>
<P>_MOST Redoubted and Royall Queene, that Kings doe feare, Subiects doe honour, strangers seeke succour of, and people of speciall spirit acknowledge (as their manifold books declare) I least of all, presume to farre, either in presenting matter to be iudged of, or to ad|uenture the cracking of credite, with writing any thing, that may breede mislike (presents not well ta|ken) in the deepe iudgement of so high and mightie a Princesse. But where a multitude runnes forward (forced through desire or fortune) to shewe duetie, or to see what falleth out of their forwardnes, I step|ping in among the rest, am driuen and led (by affec|tion
<PB REF="3">
to followe) beyond the force of my power or fee|ling of any learned arte. So being thrust on with the throng, I finding my self brought before the presence of your Maiestie (but barely furnished of know|ledge) to whom I must vtter some matter of delight, or from whom I must retourne all abashed with open disgrace. Thus Gracious Lady, vnder your Prince|ly fauour I haue vndertaken to set foorth a worke in the honour of VVales, where your highnes aunce|stors tooke name, and where your Maiestie is as much loued and feared, as in any place of your high|nesse dominion. And the loue and obedience of which people so exceedes, and surpasseth the common good|will of the worlde, that it seemeth a wonder in our age (wherein are so many writers) that no one man doth not worthely according to the countries good|nes set forth that noble Soyle and Nation. Though in deede diuers haue sleightly written of the same, and some of those labours deserueth the reading, yet except the eye be a witnes to their workes, the wri|ters can not therein sufficiently yeeld due commen|dation to those stately Soyles and Principalities. For which cause I haue trauayled sondry times of purpose through the same, and what is written of I haue beheld, and throughly seene, to my great con|tentment
<PB REF="3">
and admiration. For the Citties, Townes, and goodly Castles thereof are to be mused on, and merites to bee registred in euerlasting memorie, but chiefly the Castles (that stand like a company of Fortes) may not be forgotten, their buyldings are so princely, their strength is so greate, and they are such stately seates and defences of nature. To which Castles great Royaltie and liuings belongeth, and haue bene and are in the giftes of Princes, now pos|sessed of noble men and such as they appoint to keep them. The royalties whereof are alwayes looked vn|to, but the Castles doe dayly decay, a sorrowfull sight and in a maner remediles. But nowe to come to the co~ditions of the people, &amp; to shew somewhat of their curtesie, loyalty, &amp; naturall kindnes, I presume your Maiestie will pardon me to speake of, for of trueth your highnes is no soner named among them, but such a generall reioysing doth arise, as maketh glad any good mans hart to behold or heare it, it proceeds of such an affectionate fauour. For let the meanest of the Court come downe to that countrey, he shalbe so saluted, halsed and made of, as though he were some Lords sonne of that soyle, &amp; further the plain people thinks it debt &amp; duetie, to follow a strangers Stirrop (being out of the way) to bring him where
<PB REF="4">
he wisheth, which gentlenes in all countries is not vsed, and yet besides all this goodnes and great re|gard, there is neither hewe nor cry (for a robbery) in many hundreth myles riding, so whether it be for feare of iustice, loue of God, or good disposition, small Robberies or none at all are heard of there. They triumph likewise so much of fidelitie, that the very name of a falsifier of promes, a murtherer or a theef, is most odious among them, especially a Traytor is so hated, that his whole race is rated at and abhord as I haue heard there, report of Parrie and others, who the common people would haue torne in peeces if the lawe had not proceeded. And such regard they haue one of another, that neither in market townes, high wayes, meetings, nor publicke assemblies they striue not for place, nor shewe any kind of roysting: for in sted of such high stomackes and stoutnes, they vse frendly salutations and courtesie, acknowled|ging duetie thereby, &amp; doing such reuerence to their betters, that euery one in his degree is so well vn|derctood and honored, that none can iustly say hee hath suffered iniurie, or found offence by the rude &amp; burbarous behauiour of the people. These vsages of theirs, with the rest that may be spoken of their ciuil maner and honest frame of lyfe, doth argue there is
<PB REF="4">
some more nobler nature in that Nation, then is ge|nerally reported, which I doubt not but your High|nes is as willing to heare as I am desirous to make manifest and publish: the hope whereof redoubleth my boldnes, and may happely sheeld me from the ha|zard of worlds hastie iudgement, that condemnes men without cause for writing that they know, and praysing of people before their faces: (which suspi|cious heads call a kind of adulation) but if telling of troth, be rebukable, and playne speeches be offensiue, the ignorant world shall dwell long in errors, and true writers may sodaynly sit in silence. I haue not only searched sondry good Authors for the confir|mation of my matter, but also paynfully traueiled to trye out the substance of that is written, for feare of committing some vnpardonable fault and offence, in presenting this Booke vnto your Highnesse. VVhich worke, albeit it is but litle, (because it trea|teth not of many Shieres) yet greatly it shal reioyce the whole Countrey of VVales, whe~ they shall heare it hath found fauour in your gracious sight, &amp; hath passed through those blessed hands, that holds the rayne and bridle of many a stately Kingdome, and Terrytorie. And my selfe shall reape so much glad|nesse, by the free passage of this simple labour, that
<PB REF="5">
hereafter I shall goe through (GOD sparing life) with the rest of the other Shieres not heere named. These things only taken in ha~d, to cause your High|nesse to knowe, what puysance and strength such a Princesse is of, that may commaund such a people: and what obedience loue and <UNCLEAR>loyaltie</UNCLEAR> is in such a Countrey, as hereunto hath bin but little spoken of, and yet deserueth most greatest lawdation. And in deede the more honorable it is, for that your High|nesse princely Auncestors sprong forth of the noble braunches of that Nation. Thus duetifully pray|ing for your Maiesties long preseruation, (by whose bountie and goodnesse I a long while haue liued) I wish your Highnesse all the hap, honour, victorie, and harts ease, that can be desired or imagined.</P>

<HEAD>&leaf;To euery louing and friendly Reader.</HEAD>
<P>_IT may seeme straunge (good Rea|der) that I haue chosen in the end of my daies to trauaile, and make discription of Countries: whereas the beginning of my youth (and a long while after) I haue hau~ted the warres, and written somewhat of Martiall Discipline: but as euery season breedeth a seuerall humour, and the humours of men are diuers: (drawing the mynd to sondrie dispositions) so common occasion that commands the iudgement, hath set me a worke, and the warme good will &amp; affection, borne in breast, towards the worthie Coun|trey of Wales, hath haled me often forward, to take this la|bour in hand, which many before haue learnedly handled. But yet to shewe a difference in writing, and a playnnesse in speech (because playne people affects no florishing phrase) I haue now in as ample a maner (without borrowed termes) as I could, declared my opinion of that sweete Soyle and good Subiects therof, euen at that very instant, when Wales was almost forgotten, or scarce remembred with any great lawdation, when it hath merited to be written of: for son|drie famous causes most meete to be honored, and necessary to be touched in. First, the world will confesse (or els it shall do wrong) that some of our greatest Kings (that haue con|quered much) were borne &amp; bred in that Countrey: which Kings in their times, to the glory of England, haue wrought wonders, &amp; brought great benefites to our weale publicke. Among the same Princes, I pray you giue me leaue to place our good Queene Elizabeth, and pardo~ me withall to com|mit
<PB REF="6">
you to the Chronicles, for the seeking out of her Aun|cestors noble actions, and suffer me to shewe a little of the goodnesse, gathered by vs, from her Maiesties well doing, and possessed a long season from her princely and iust dea|lings. An act so noble &amp; notorious, that neither can escape immortall fame, nor shall not passe my pen vnresited.</P>
<P>Now weigh in what plight was our state when she came first to the Crowne, and see how soone Religion was refor|med, (a matter of great moment) peace planted, and warres vtterly extinguished, as the sequell yet falleth out.</P>
<P>Then behold how she succoured the afflicted in <HI>Fraunce,</HI> (let the going to <HI>Newhauen</HI> beare witnesse) and chargeably without breaking of League mainteyned her friends and a|mazed her enemies.</P>
<P>Then looke into the seruice and preseruation of <HI>Scotland</HI> (at the siege of <HI>Leeth</HI>) and see how finely the French were al shipped away (they being a great power) and sent home in such sort, that neuer since they had mynd to returne thether againe, in that fashion and forme that they sayled towards <HI>Scotland</HI> at the first.</P>
<P>Then consider how bace our money was, &amp; in what short tyme (with little losse to our Countrey) the bad coyne was conuerted to good siluer: and so is like to continue to the end of the world.</P>
<P>Then in the aduancing of Gods word and good people, regard how <HI>Rochell</HI> was relieued, and <HI>Rone</HI> and other places fou~d cause to pray for her life, who sought to purchase their peace and see them in safetie.</P>
<P>Then thinke on the care she tooke for <HI>Flaunders,</HI> during the first troubles, and how that Countrey had bene vtterly destroyed, if her Highnes helping hand had not propped vp that tottering State.</P>
<P>Then Christianly co~ceiue how many mul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">itudes of stran|gers she hath giuen gracious countenance vnto, and hath freely licensed them to liue here in peace and rest.</P>
<P>Then paise in an equall ballance the daungerous estate of <HI>Scotland</HI> once againe, when the Kings owne Subiects kept
<PB REF="6">
the Castle of <HI>Edenbrough</HI> against their owne naturall Lord &amp; Maister: which presumptuous part of Subiects, her High|nesse could not abide to behold: wherevpon she sent a suffi|cient power to ayde the Kings Maiestie: which power vali|antly wonne the Castle, and freely deliuered the same to the right owner thereof, with all the treasure and prisoners therein.</P>
<P>Then regard how honourably she hath dealt with diuers Princes that came to see her, or needed her magnifice~t sup|portation and countenance.</P>
<P>Then looke throughly into the mightinesse &amp; managing of all matters gone about and put in exercise princely, and yet peaceably since the day of her Highnesse Coronation, and you shalbe forced to confesse that she surmounts a great number of her Predecessors: and she is not at this day no whit inferiour to the greatest Monarke of the world.</P>
<P>Is not such a peereles Queene then, a comfort to Wales, a glorie to England, and a great reioysing to all her good neighbours? And doth not she daily deserue to haue bookes dedicated in the highest degree of honor to her Highnesse? Yes vndoubtedly, or els my sences and iudgement fayleth me.</P>
<P>So (good Reader) do iudge of my labours: my pen is pro|cured by a band of causes to write as farre as my knowledge may leade: and my duetie hath no end of seruice, nor no li|mits are set to a loyall Subiect, but to wish and worke to the vttermost of power.</P>
<P>Within this worke are seuerall discourses: some of the beautie &amp; blessednes of the Countrey: some of the strength and statelynesse of their inpregnable Castles: some of their trim Townes and fine situation: some of their antiquitie, shewing from what Kings and Princes they tooke their first name and prerogatiue. So generally of all maner of matters belonging to that Soyle, as Churches, Monuments, Moun|taynes, Valleys, Waters, Bridges, fayre Gentlemens houses, and the rest of things whatsoeuer, may become a writers pen to touch, or a readers iudgement to knowe. I write not
<PB REF="7">
contenciously to find fault with any, or confute the former writers and tyme:<NOTE PLACE="marg">William <UNCLEAR>Malmesburie</UNCLEAR> de regibus an|glorum. Dauid Powell a <UNCLEAR>late</UNCLEAR> writer, yet excellently learned, made a sharp <UNCLEAR>inuec|tiue</UNCLEAR> against William Par|uus and Polli|dor Virgill (&amp; all their com|plices) accu|sing them of lying tongues, enuyous de|traction, mali|cious slaun|ders, reproach|full and veno+mous lan|guage, wilfull <UNCLEAR>ignora~ce</UNCLEAR>, dog|ged enuie, and <UNCLEAR>canckered</UNCLEAR> mindes, for that thei spake vnreuerently of Arthur, and many other thrise noble Princes. Jeffrey of Monmouth. Matthewe of Westminster, and others are here in like sort to be read &amp; looked on.</NOTE> but to aduaunce and winne credite to the present trueth, agreeing and yeelding to all former tymes and ages, that hath iustly giuen euery Nation their due, and truely without affection hath set downe in plaine words the worthines of plaine people: for I honor and loue as much a true Author, as I hate and detest a reporter of trifeling fa|bles. A true Historie is called the Mistresse of life: and yet all Historyographers in writing of one thing, agree not well one with another: because the writers were not present in the tymes, in the places, nor saw the persons they make me~|tion of: but rather haue leaned and listned on the common report, than stayed or trusted to their owne experience.</P>
<P><HI>Strabo</HI> a most famous writer findes fault (for the like oc|casion) with <HI>Erstaotheus, Metrodorus, Septius, Possidonius,</HI> and <HI>Patrocles</HI> the Geographer: And such discord did arise amo~g writers in tyme past, as <HI>Iosephus</HI> saith against <HI>Appio,</HI> that they reprooued one another by bookes, and all men in generall reprooued <HI>Herodotus.</HI></P>
<P>God shield me from such caueling: for I deliuer but what I haue seene and read: alledging for defence both auncient Authors, and good tryall of that is written. Wherefore (lo|uing Reader) doe rather struggle with those two strong pil|lars of knowledge, than striue with the weaknesse of my in|uention: which to auoyde sharpnesse (and bitter words) is sweetned and seasoned with gentle verses, more pleasant to some mens eares then prose, and vnder whose smooth grace of speech, more acceptable matter is conuayed, then the common sort of people can comprehend. For verses like a familiar friend (with a gallant phrase) rides quietly by thou|sands, and dasheth no one person, and galloping cleanly a|way merites no rebuke: when prose with a soft pace cannot with such cunning passe vnperceiued. But all is one when in neither of both is found no matter of mistrust, nor speeches to offend, there is no cause of dislike. So crauing thy good opinion, good Reader farewell.</P>

<HEAD>&para; An Introduction to the Letters sent from Lucius Tyberius, at the Coro|nation of King Arthur.</HEAD>
<P>NOt vnwilling to delate and make large the matter now written of, &amp; further because the raigne of King <HI>Arthur</HI> is diuersly treated on and vncertainly spoken of (the men of this world are growen so wise) I haue searched and found (in good Authors) such certaintie of King <HI>Arthur,</HI> and matter that merits the reading, that I am compelled with pen to explaine, and with some paines and studie to p<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">esent the world with in ge|nerall. The substance whereof being in Latin, (may be read and vnderstood by thousands) is englished because the common sorte (as well as the learned) shall see how little the Kings and Prin|ces of this Land, haue esteemed the power of the <HI>Romaines,</HI> or manasing and force of any forraine foe whatsoeuer. And for the amending of my tale, let our Soueraine Ladie be well conside|red of, (whose graces passeth my pen to shewe) and you shall see great things are encountred, and no small matters gone about and brought to good passe, in the action afore named: which be|commeth well a Qu&eacute;ene of that race, who is descended of so no|ble a progenie. But now purposing orderly to proc&eacute;ede to the
<PB REF="18">
former discourse, and to rehearse word for word, as it was left by our forefathers, (men of great learning and knowledge) I haue set doune some such Letters and Orations, as peraduenture wil make you to maruell of, or at the least to thinke on so much, that some one among a multitude, will y&eacute;eld me thankes for my la|bour, and rather encourage a true writer to continue in the like exercises, then to giue him any occasion to sit ydle, and so forget the vse of pen. There followeth hereafter those things before mentioned, which I hope the Readers will iudge with aduise|ment, and construe to the best intent and meaning. For this mat|ter not only shewes by good authoritie the royall Coronation of King <HI>Arthur,</HI> but in like maner declares with what pride and pomp the <HI>Romaines</HI> sent hether (at the very instant of this great tryumph) for tribute and homage: at which proud and presump|tuous demaund, King <HI>Arthur</HI> (and all his other Princes about him) began to bee greatly moued, and presently without further delay, gaue so sharpe and sodaine an answer to the Embassadors of <HI>Rome,</HI> that they were so vexed and abashed therewith, that they neither knewe well how to take it, nor made any further re|ply: as followes by matter presently here, if you please throughly to reade it. Consider withall, that after this Embassage, King <HI>Arthur</HI> in plaine battaile slue <HI>Lucius,</HI> and had gone to <HI>Rome</HI> to haue bene crowned Emperour there, if <HI>Mordred</HI> had not made a reuolt in <HI>Arthurs</HI> owne kingdome.</P>

<P>THE appoynted tyme of the solemnitie approching, and all being readie assembled in the Citie of <HI>Carleon,</HI> the Arch|bishops, <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Yorke</HI>: and in the Citie of <HI>Carleon</HI> the Archbishop <HI>Dubright</HI> were conueighed to the Palace, with
<PB REF="19">
royall solemnitie to crowne King <HI>Arthur. Dubright</HI> therefore (because the Court then lay within his Diocesse, furnished him|selfe accordingly to perfourme and solemnize this charge in his owne person. The King being crowned, was royally brought to the Cathedrall Church of that Metropoliticall See. On either hand of him, both the right and the left, did two Archbishoppes support him. And fower Kings, to wit, <HI>Angusell</HI> King of <HI>Alba|nia, Caduall</HI> King of <HI>Venedocia, Cador</HI> King of <HI>Cornewall,</HI> &amp; <HI>Sater</HI> King of <HI>Demetia,</HI> went before him, carying iiii. golden Swords. The companies also and concourse of sondrie sorts of officers, played afore him most melodious &amp; heauenly harmonie. On the other parte, the Qu&eacute;ene was brought to the Church of professed Nunnes, being co~ducted and accompanied with Arch|bishops and Bishops, with her Armes and titles royally garni|shed. And the Qu&eacute;enes, being wiues vnto the fower Kings a|foresayd, caryed before her (as the order and custome was) fower white Doues or Pigeons.</P>
<P>For behold, twelue discr&eacute;ete personages of reuerend counte|nance came to the King in stately maner, carying in their right hands in token and signe of Ambassage, Oliue boughes.

<HEAD>&para;Cador the Duke of Cornewall his Oration to the King.</HEAD>
<P>I Haue hitherto bene in feare, least the <HI>Britaines</HI> through much ease and long peace, should growe to flouth and cowardize&punc; and lose that honorable reputation of Cheualrie and martiall prowesse, wherein they are generally accoumpted to surmount all other Nations. For where the vse of Armes is not est&eacute;emed, but in st&eacute;ede therof, Dyeing, Carding, dalying with women and other vayne delites frequented, it cannot choose, but there cowar|dize and sluggardie must n&eacute;edes dimme and deface all vertue, honour, valiaunce, and fame. There bee now almost fiue y&eacute;eres passed, since we hauing lacked Martial exercise, haue effeminate|ly bene nuzzeled in these foresayd delites. God therefore not wil|ling to see vs any longer marred and stayned with sluggardie,
<PB REF="20">
hath stirred vp the <HI>Romaines,</HI> that they should be the meanes to reduce our auncient valour vnto the former state and dignitie. While h&eacute;e vsed these and such like wordes, confirmed by those that were there at that tyme in presence, they came at length to their Benches or Seates, where after that euery person was set and placed: <HI>Arthur</HI> vsed this sp&eacute;ech vnto them.</P>

<HEAD>&leaf;The Oration of Arthur to his Lords and people.</HEAD>
<P>MY fellowes (sayth he) and companyons both of aduersi|tie and prosperitie: whose fidelities I haue heretofore both in your sound counsels, and in exployting militare seruices had good tryall and experience of: listen now and affoord vnto me your aduise, and wisely foresee, what you thinke conue|nient for vs, touching such demaunds and commaundements, to be done. For, when a thing is wisely aforehand deliberated and carefully foreseene, when it commeth to the pinch, it is more ea|silie auoyded and tolerated. We shall therefore the easier bee able to abyde the imperious demaund of <HI>Lucius,</HI> if wee lay our heads together and foresee, how and which way, wee may best defeate and infringe the same. And (surely) for my part, I doe not thinke that we haue any cause greatly to feare him, sith vpon an vnrea|sonable cause he seeketh to haue a tribute payed out of <HI>Britaine.</HI> For, he alledgeth, that the same is due and payable to him, be|cause it was payd to <HI>Iulius Caesar</HI> and others his Successors, which being inuited and called hether through the discorde and iarres of the auncient <HI>Britaines,</HI> arriued here in <HI>Britaine</HI> with numbers of armed Soldiours: and with force and vyolence, brought vnder their subiection, this our Countrey, miserably tos|sed with ciuile garboyles and domesticall discord. And because they in this sort, got the possession of it, they haue since taken and vniustly receiued a Tribute out of it. For nothing that is gotten by force and vyolence, is iustly possessed by him that offered the vyolence. The cause therefore which he pretendeth is vnreasona|ble,
<PB REF="20">
whereby he d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span">eth vs by law and right to be tributarie vn|to them.

<HEAD>&para; Of Valey Crucis Thlangothlan, and the Castle Dynosebrane.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THE great desire, to see <HI>Denbigh</HI> at full,</L>
<L>Did drawe my muse, from other matter true:</L>
<L>But as that sight, my mynd away did pull</L>
<L>From former things, I should present to you.</L>
<L>So duetie bids, a writer to be playne,</L>
<L>And things left out, to call to mynd agayne:</L>
<L><HI>Thlangothlan</HI> then, must yet come once in place,</L>
<L>For diuers notes, that giues this booke some grace.</L>
</LG>

<PB REF="54">
<L><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Abbey of Valey Crucis.</HI></NOTE>An Abbey nere, that Mountayne towne there is,</L>
<L>Whose walles yet stand, and steeple too likewise:</L>
<L>But who that rides, to see the troth of this,</L>
<L>Shall thinke he mounts, on hilles vnto the Skyes.</L>
<L>For when one hill, behind your backe you see,</L>
<L>Another comes, two tymes as hye as hee:</L>
<L>And in one place, the Mountaynes stands so there,</L>
<L>In roundnesse such, as it a Cockpit were.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Their height is great, and full of narrowe waies,</L>
<L>And st&eacute;epe downe right, of force ye must descend:</L>
<L>Some houses are, buylt there but of late daies,</L>
<L>Full vnderneath, the monstrous Mountaynes end:</L>
<L>Amid them all, and those as man may gesse,</L>
<L>When rayne doth fall, doth stand in sore distresse:</L>
<L>For mightie streames, runnes ore both house and thatch,</L>
<L>When for their liues, poore men on Hilles must watch.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Beyond the same, and yet on Hill full hye,</L>
<L><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Castle <UNCLEAR>Dy|nosebraen</UNCLEAR>.</HI></NOTE>A Castle stands, an old and ruynous thing:</L>
<L>That haughtie house, was buylt in weathers eye,</L>
<L>A pretie pyle, and pleasure for a King.</L>
<L>A Fort, a Strength, a strong and stately Hold</L>
<L>It was at first, though now it is full old:</L>
<L>On Rocke alone, full farre from other Mount</L>
<L>It stands, which shewes, it was of great account.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Betw&eacute;ene the Towne, and Abbey built it was,</L>
<L><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>A goodly bridge of stone here.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Towne and the bridge with the vyo|lent Riuer be|fore that Towne.</HI></P></NOTE>The Towne is n&eacute;ere, the goodly Riuer D&eacute;e,</L>
<L>That vnderneath, a Bridge of stone doth passe,</L>
<L>And still on Rocke, the water runnes you see</L>
<L>A wondrous way, a thing full rare and straunge,</L>
<L>That Rocke cannot, the course of water chaunge:</L>
<L>For in the streame, huge stones and Rocks remayne,</L>
<L>That backward might, the flood of force constrayne.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB REF="54">
<L>From thence to Chirke, are Mountaynes all a rowe,</L>
<L>As though in ranke, and battaile Mountaynes stood:</L>
<L>And ouer them, the bitter winde doth blowe,</L>
<L>And whirles betwixt, the valley and the wood.</L>
<L>Chirke is a place, that parts another Sheere,</L>
<L>And as by Trench, and Mount doth well appeere:</L>
<L>It kept those bounds, from forrayne force and power,</L>
<L>That men might sl&eacute;epe, in suretie euery hower.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here <HI>Denbighshiere,</HI> departs from writers pen,</L>
<L>And <HI>Flintshiere</HI> now,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A little spoke of Fluntshiere.</HI></NOTE> comes brauely marching in,</L>
<L>With Castles fine, with proper Townes and men,</L>
<L>Whereof in verse, my matter must begin:</L>
<L>Not for to fayne, and please the tender eares,</L>
<L>But to be playne,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Author fell sicke here.</HI></NOTE> as worlds eye witnesse beares:</L>
<L>Not by heresay, as fables are set out,</L>
<L>But by good proofe, of vewe to voyd a dout.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHen Sommer sw&eacute;ete,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The writer takes here breath till a better season serues.</HI></NOTE> hath blowne ore Winters blast,</L>
<L>And waies waxe hard, that now are soft and foule:</L>
<L>When calmie Skyes, sayth bitter stormes are past,</L>
<L>And Clowdes waxe cl&eacute;ere, that now doth lowre and skoule,</L>
<L>My muse I hope, shall be reuiu'de againe,</L>
<L>That now lyes dead, or rockt a sleepe with paine.</L>
<L>For labour long, hath wearied so the wit,</L>
<L>That studious head, a while in rest must sit:</L>
<L>But when the Spring, comes on with newe delite,</L>
<L>You shall from me, heare what my muse doth write.</L>
</LG>
<TRAILER>Here endeth my first booke of <HI>the worthines of Wales:</HI> which being wel taken, wil encourage me to set forth another: in which work, not only the rest of the Shieres (that now are not written of) shalbe orderly put in print, but likewise all y^e auncient Armes of Gentlemen there in general shalbe plainly described &amp; set out, to the open vewe of the world, if God permit me life and health, towards the finishing of so great a labour.</TRAILER>
