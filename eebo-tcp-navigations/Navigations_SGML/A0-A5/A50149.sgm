<P>THE Station in which the Hand of the God of Hea|ven hath di&s;po&s;ed His Ma|je&s;ties Heart to place your Honour, doth &s;o mani|fe&s;tly entitle your Lord&s;hip to this in|&s;uing Narrative, that its being thus Pre|&s;ented to your Excellencies Hand is thereby both Apologized for and Ju&s;ti|fied. I believe, had the Writer of it, when he Penned it, had any Knowledge of your Excellency, he would him&s;elf have done it, and withal would have amply and publickly Congratulated the
<PB REF="3">People of <HI>New England,</HI> on account of their having &s;uch a Governour, and your Excellency on account of your be|ing made Governour over them. For though as to &s;ome other things it may po&s;&s;ibly be a place to &s;ome Per&s;ons not &s;o de&s;irable, yet I believe this Character may be ju&s;tly given of them, that they are the be&s;t People under Heaven; there being among them, not only le&s;s of o|pen Profanene&s;s, and le&s;s of Lewdne&s;s, but al&s;o more of the &s;erious Profe&s;&s;ion, Practi&s;e, and Power of Chri&s;tianity in proportion to their number, then is a|mong any other People upon the Face of the whole Earth. Not but I doubt, there are many bad Per&s;ons among them, and too many di&s;temper'd Humours, per|haps even among tho&s;e who are truly good. It would be a wonder, if it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e; for it hath of late Years on various accounts, and &s;ome ve|ry &s;ingular and unu&s;ual ones, been a Day of &s;ore Temptation with that whole People. Neverthele&s;s, as I look upon it as a Favour from God to tho&s;e Plantations
<PB REF="3">that he hath &s;et your Excellency over them, &s;o I do account it a Favour from God to your Excellency, that he hath committed and tru&s;ted in your Hand, &s;o great a part of his peculiar Trea&s;ure and precious Jewels, as are among that Peo|ple. Be&s;ides, that on other accounts the Lord Je&s;us hath more of a vi&s;ible Inte|re&s;t in <HI>New England,</HI> then in any of the outgoings of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation in <HI>Ame|rica.</HI> They have at their own Charge not only &s;et up Schools of lower Learning up and down the Country; but have al|&s;o erected an Univer&s;ity, which hath been the happy Nur&s;ery of many u&s;eful, Learned, and excellently accompli&s;hed Per&s;ons. And moreover, from them hath the ble&s;&s;ed Go&s;pel been Preached to the poor barbarous &s;avage <HI>Heathen</HI> there, and it hath taken &s;uch root among them, that there were lately four and twenty A&s;&s;emblies in which the Name of the Lord Je&s;us was con&s;tantly called on, and celebrated in their own Lan|guage. In the&s;e things <HI>New England</HI> out&s;hineth all the Colonies of the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI>
<PB REF="4">in tho&s;e goings down of the Sun. I know your Excellency will Favour and Countenance their Univer&s;ity, and al&s;o the Propagating of the Go&s;pel among the Natives; for the Intere&s;t of Chri&s;t in that Part of the Earth is much concerned in them. That the God of the Spirits of all Fle&s;h would abundantly repleni&s;h your Excellency with a &s;uitable Spirit for the Service to which he hath called your Lord&s;hip, that he would give your Honour a pro&s;perous Voyage thither, and when there, make your Excellency a rich Ble&s;&s;ing to that People, and them a rejoycing to your Excellency, is the Prayer of</P>

<P>HIS Friends earne&s;tly &s;olicited him to &s;ettle among them in a Plantation of the <HI>Ea&s;t;</HI> but he had an Unaccountable <HI>Impul&s;e</HI> upon his Mind, per&s;wading him, as he would privately hint unto &s;ome of them, <HI>That he was Born to Greater Matters.</HI> To come at tho&s;e <HI>Greater Matters,</HI> his fir&s;t Contrivance was to bind him|&s;elf an Apprentice unto a <HI>Ship-Carpenter</HI> for Four Years; in which Time, he became a Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Trade,</HI> that once in a Ve&s;&s;el of more than <HI>Forty Thou|&s;and Tuns,</HI> Repaired the Ruines of the Earth. He then betook him&s;elf an Hundred and Fifty Miles further a Field, even to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> the chief Town of <HI>New-England;</HI> which being a Place of the mo&s;t Bu&s;ine&s;s and Re&s;ort in tho&s;e parts of the World; he expected there more commodiou&s;ly to pur&s;ue the <HI>Spes Majorum &amp; Melio|rum, Hopes</HI> which had In&s;pir'd him. At <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> where it was that he now learnt, fir&s;t of all, to <HI>Read</HI> and <HI>Write;</HI> be followed his Trade for about a Year; and, by a laudable Deportment, &s;o recommended him&s;elf, that he Married a Young Gentlewoman of Good Re|pute, who was the Widow of one Mr. <HI>John Hull,</HI> a well-bred Merchant, but the Daughter of one Captain <HI>Roger Spencer,</HI> a Per&s;on of good Fa&s;hion, who having &s;uffer'd much dammage in his E&s;tate, by &s;ome unkind and un|ju&s;t actions, which he bore with &s;uch Patience, that for fear of thereby injuring the Publick, he would not &s;eek &s;atisfaction, <HI>Po&s;terity</HI> might afterwards &s;ee the reward of his <HI>patience,</HI> in what Providence hath now done for one of his own <HI>Po&s;terity.</HI> Within a little while after his Marriage, he Indented with &s;everal
<PB N="6" REF="10">per&s;ons in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> to build them a Ship at <HI>Sheeps-coat</HI> River, two or three Leagues Ea&s;tward of <HI>Kennebeck;</HI> where having Lanched the Ship, he al&s;o provided a <HI>Lading</HI> of Lumber to bring with him, which would have been to the advantage of all concern'd. But ju&s;t as the Ship was hardly fini&s;hed, the barbarous <HI>Indians</HI> on that River, broke forth into an Open and Cruel War upon the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and the mi&s;erable People, &s;urpri&s;ed by &s;o &s;udden a &s;torm of Bloud, had no Refuge from the Infidels, but the <HI>Ship</HI> now fini&s;hing in the Har|bour. Whereupon, he left his intended <HI>Lading</HI> be|hind him, and in&s;tead thereof, carried with him, his Old Neighbours and their Families, free of all Char|ges to <HI>Bo&s;ton;</HI> So, the <HI>Fir&s;t Action</HI> that he did, after he was his own Man, was to <HI>Save his Fathers Hou&s;e,</HI> with the re&s;t of the Neighbourhood, from Ruine; but the Di&s;appointment which befel him from the Lo&s;s of his other <HI>Lading,</HI> plunged his Affairs into greater Embara&s;&s;ments with &s;uch as had employ'd him.</P>

<P>BUT he was hitherto, no more than beginning to make <HI>Scaffolds</HI> for further and higher <HI>Actions!</HI> He would frequently tell the Gentlewoman his Wife, That he &s;hould yet be <HI>Captain of a King's Ship;</HI> That he &s;hould come to have the <HI>Command of better Men</HI> than he was now accounted him&s;elf; And, That he &s;hould be Owner of a <HI>Fair Brick-Hou&s;e</HI> in the <HI>Green-Lane</HI> of <HI>North-Bo&s;ton;</HI> and, That it may be, this would not be all that the Providence of God would bring him to. She entertained the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages with a &s;ufficient Incredulity; but he had &s;o <HI>&s;erious</HI> and <HI>po|&s;itive</HI> an Expectation of them, that it is not ca&s;ie to &s;ay, what was the <HI>Original</HI> thereof. He was of an Enterprizing <HI>Genius,</HI> and naturally di&s;dained <HI>Little|ne&s;s:</HI> But his Di&s;po&s;ition for <HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> was of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Mould, where, with a little &s;hew of <HI>Wit,</HI> there is as much <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> demon&s;trated, as can be &s;hewn by any Nation. His Talent lay not in the <HI>Airs,</HI> that &s;erve chiefly for
<PB N="7" REF="10">the plea&s;ant and &s;udden Turns of <HI>Conver&s;ation;</HI> but, he might &s;ay, as <HI>Themi&s;tocles, Though he could not play upon a Fiddle, yet he knew how to make a little City be|come a Great One.</HI> He would <HI>prudently</HI> contrive a weigh|ty Undertaking, and then patiently pur&s;ue it unto the End. He was of an Inclination, cutting rather like a <HI>Hatchet,</HI> than like a <HI>Razor;</HI> he would propo&s;e very Con&s;iderable Matters to him&s;elf, and then &s;o <HI>cut through</HI> them, that no Difficulties could put by the <HI>Edge</HI> of his Re&s;olutions. Being thus of the <HI>True Temper,</HI> for doing of <HI>Great Things,</HI> he betakes him&s;elf to the <HI>Sea,</HI> the Right <HI>Scene</HI> for &s;uch Things; and upon Advice of a <HI>Spani&s;h Wreck</HI> about the <HI>Bahama's,</HI> he took a Voyage thither; but with little more &s;ucce&s;s, than what ju&s;t &s;erved him a little to furni&s;h him for a Voyage to <HI>Eng|land;</HI> whither he went in a Ve&s;&s;el, not much unlike that, which the <HI>Dutchmen</HI> &s;tamped on their <HI>Fir&s;t Coin,</HI> with the&s;e Words about it, <HI>Incertum quo Fata ferant.</HI> Having fir&s;t informed him&s;elf, that there was another <HI>Spani&s;h Wreck,</HI> wherein was lo&s;t a mighty Trea&s;ure, hi|therto undi&s;covered, he had a &s;trong Impre&s;&s;ion up|on his Mind, that <HI>He</HI> mu&s;t be the Di&s;coverer; and he made &s;uch Repre&s;entations of his De&s;ign at <HI>White-Hall,</HI> that by the Year 1683, he became the Captain of <HI>a King's Ship,</HI> and arrived at <HI>New-England,</HI> Com|mander of the <HI>Algier-Ro&s;e,</HI> a Frigate of Eighteen Guns, and Ninety five Men.</P>

<P>TO Relate all the <HI>Dargers</HI> through which he pa&s;&s;ed, both by Sea and Land, and all the Tire&s;ome Trials of his <HI>Patience,</HI> as well as of his <HI>Courage,</HI> while Year after Year, the mo&s;t vexing Accidents imaginable, delay'd the Succe&s;s of his De&s;ign, it would even Tire the pa|tience of the Reader: For very great was the Expe|riment that Captain <HI>Phips</HI> made of the <HI>Italian</HI> Ob&s;er|vation, <HI>He that cann't &s;uffer both Good and Evil, will ne|ver come to any great Preferment.</HI> Wherefore I &s;hall &s;uper&s;ede all <HI>Journal</HI> of his Voyages to and fro, with
<PB N="8" REF="11">reciting one In&s;tance of his Conduct, that &s;how'd him to be a Per&s;on of no contemptible Capacity. While he was Captain of the <HI>Algier-Ro&s;e,</HI> his Men growing weary of their un&s;ucce&s;sful Enterprize, made a Muti|ny, wherein they approach'd him on the Quarter-Deck, with Drawn Swords in their Hands, and required him to join with them in Running away with the Ship, to drive a Trade of Pyracy on the <HI>South Seas.</HI> Captain <HI>Phips,</HI> though he had not &s;o much of a Weapon, as an <HI>Ox-Goad,</HI> or a <HI>Jaw-bone</HI> in his Hands, yet like ano|ther <HI>Shamgar</HI> or <HI>Samp&s;on,</HI> with a mo&s;t undaunted For|titude, he ru&s;h'd in upon them, and with the Blows of his bare Hands, <HI>Fell'd</HI> many of them, and <HI>Quell'd</HI> all the Re&s;t. But this is not the In&s;tance which I intend|ed: That which I intend is, That (as it has been related unto me) One Day, while his Frigate lay <HI>Careening,</HI> at a de&s;olate <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> I&s;land, by the &s;ide of a Rock, from whence they had laid a Bridge to the Shoar, the Men, whereof he had about an <HI>Hundred,</HI> went all but about Eight or Ten, to divert them&s;elves, as they pretended, in the <HI>Woods:</HI> Where, they all entred into an <HI>Agreement,</HI> which they Sign'd in a Ring, That about &s;even a Clock that Evening, they would &s;eize the Captain, and tho&s;e Eight or Ten, which they knew to be True unto him, and leave them to peri&s;h on this I&s;land, and &s;o be gone away unto the <HI>South Sea</HI> to <HI>&s;eek their Fortune.</HI> Will the Reader now imagine, that Captain <HI>Phips</HI> having Advice of this Plot, but about an Hour and half before it was to be put in Execution, yet within <HI>Two Hours</HI> brought all the&s;e Rogues down upon their Knees, to beg for their lives? But &s;o it was! For the&s;e Knaves con&s;idering, that they &s;hould want a <HI>Carpenter</HI> with them in their <HI>Villanous Expedition,</HI> &s;ent a Me&s;&s;enger to fetch unto them the <HI>Carpenter,</HI> who was then at Work upon the Ve&s;&s;el; and unto him they &s;hew'd their <HI>Articles,</HI> telling him what he mu&s;t look for, if he did not <HI>&s;ub&s;cribe</HI> among them. The <HI>Carpenter</HI> being an hone&s;t Fellow, did with much importunity, prevail for one half hours Time to con&s;ider of the Matter; and returning to
<PB N="9" REF="11">Work upon the Ve&s;&s;el, with a <HI>Spy</HI> by them &s;et upon him, he feigned him&s;elf taken with a Fit of the <HI>Cho|lick,</HI> for the Relief whereof he &s;uddenly run unto the Captain in the Great Cabbin for a <HI>Dram;</HI> where, when he came, his bu&s;ine&s;s was only in brief, to tell the Captain of the horrible Di&s;tre&s;s which he was fallen into; but the Captain bid him as briefly, re|turn to the Rogues in the <HI>Woods,</HI> and Sign their <HI>Arti|cles,</HI> and leave <HI>him</HI> to provide for the Re&s;t. The <HI>Car|penter</HI> was no &s;ooner gone, but Captain <HI>Phips</HI> calling together the few Friends (it may be &s;even or eight) that were left him aboard, whereof the Gunner was one, demanded of them, whether they would &s;tand by him in the Extremity, which he informed them was now come upon him; whereto they reply'd, <HI>They would &s;tand by him, if he could &s;ave them;</HI> And he An&s;wer'd, <HI>By the help of God, he did not fear it.</HI> All their Provi&s;ions had been carried a &s;hoar to a Tent, made for that purpo&s;e there; about which they had placed &s;everal Great Guns to defend it, in ca&s;e of any <HI>A&s;&s;ault</HI> from <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that might happen to come that way. Wherefore Captain <HI>Phips,</HI> immediately ordered tho&s;e Guns to be &s;ilently Drawn and Turn'd; and &s;o, pulling up the Bridge, he charged his Great Guns aboard, and brought them to Bear on every &s;ide of the Tent. By this Time the <HI>Army of Rebels</HI> comes out of the Woods; but as they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">rew near to the Tent of Provi&s;ions, they &s;aw &s;uch a change of Circum|&s;tances, that they cryed out, <HI>We are Betray'd!</HI> and they were &s;oon confirm'd in it, when they heard the Cap|tain with a &s;tern Fury call to them, <HI>Stand off, ye Wretches at your Peril!</HI> He quickly &s;aw them ca&s;t into a more than ordinary confu&s;ion, when they &s;aw <HI>Him</HI> ready to Fire his Great Guns upon them, if they offered one Step further than he permitted them: And, when he had &s;ignified unto them his <HI>Re&s;olve</HI> to abandon them unto all the De&s;olation which they had pur|po&s;ed for <HI>him;</HI> he cau&s;ed the <HI>Bridge</HI> to be again laid, and his Men begun to take the Provi&s;ions aboard. When the Wretches beheld what was coming upon
<PB N="10" REF="12">them, they fell to very humble Entreaties; and at la&s;t, fell down upon their Knees, prote&s;ting, <HI>That they never had any thing again&s;t him, except only his unwill|ingne&s;s to go away with the King's Ship upon the</HI> South-Sea <HI>De&s;ign: But upon all other Accounts, they would choo&s;e rather to Live and Die with him, than with any Man in the World; however, &s;ince they &s;aw how much he was di&s;&s;atisfied at it, they would in&s;i&s;t upon it no more, and humbly begg'd his Pardon.</HI> And when he judg'd, that he had kept them on their <HI>Knees</HI> long enough, he having fir&s;t &s;ecur'd their <HI>Arms,</HI> received them aboard; but he immediately weighed Anchor, and arriving at <HI>Jamai|ca,</HI> he Turn'd them off. Now with a &s;mall Compa|ny of other Men, he &s;ailed from thence to <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> where, by the Policy of his Addre&s;s, he fi&s;hed out of a very old <HI>Spaniard,</HI> (or <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI>) a little advice about the true Spot where lay the <HI>Wreck,</HI> which he had been hitherto &s;eeking, as unpro&s;perou&s;ly, as the <HI>Chymi&s;ts</HI> have their <HI>Aurifick Stone:</HI> That it was up|on a <HI>Reef of Shoals,</HI> a few Leagues to the Northward of <HI>Port de la Plata,</HI> upon <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> a Port &s;o call'd, it &s;eems, from the Landing of &s;ome of the <HI>Ship-wreck'd</HI> Company, with a Boat full of Plate, &s;aved out of their Sinking Frigate: Neverthele&s;s, when he had &s;earched very narrowly the Spot, whereof the Old <HI>Spaniard</HI> had advi&s;ed him, he not hitherto exactly lit upon it. Such <HI>Thorns</HI> did vex his Affairs, while he was in the <HI>Ro&s;e-Frigat;</HI> but none of all the&s;e things could retund the Edge of his Expectations to find the <HI>Wreck;</HI> with &s;uch Expectations he return'd then into <HI>England,</HI> that he might there better furni&s;h him&s;elf to Pro&s;ecute a <HI>New Di&s;covery;</HI> for though he judged, he might, by proceeding a little further, have come at the right <HI>Spot,</HI> yet he found his pre&s;ent Company too ill a Crew to be confided in.</P>

<P>SO <HI>proper</HI> was his Behaviour, that the be&s;t Noble Men in the Kingdom, now admited him into their

He who can wait, hath what he de&s;ireth.</HI> This his Indefatigable <HI>Patience,</HI> with a proportion|able <HI>Diligence,</HI> at length overcame the Difficulties that had bin thrown in his way; and prevailing with the Duke of <HI>Albemarl,</HI> and &s;ome other Per&s;ons of Quality, to fit him out, he &s;et Sail for the <HI>Fi&s;hing-Ground,</HI> which had bin &s;o well <HI>baited,</HI> half an Hundred Years before: And as he had already di&s;covered his <HI>Capacity for bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> in many con&s;iderable Actions, he now added unto tho&s;e Di&s;coveries, by not only <HI>provid|ing</HI> all, but al&s;o by <HI>inventing</HI> many of the In&s;truments nece&s;&s;ary to the pro&s;ecution of his intended <HI>Fi&s;hery.</HI> Captain <HI>Phips</HI> arriving with a Ship and a <HI>Tender,</HI> at <HI>Port de la Plata,</HI> made a &s;tout <HI>Canoo</HI> of a &s;tately <HI>Cot|ton Tree,</HI> &s;o large as to carry Eight or Ten Oars, for the making of which <HI>Periaga</HI> (as they call it) he did, with the &s;ame indu&s;try that he did every thing el&s;e, employ his own <HI>Hand</HI> and <HI>Ad&s;e,</HI> and endure no little hard&s;hip, lying abroad in the Woods many Nights to|gether. This <HI>Periaga,</HI> with the <HI>Tender,</HI> being Ancho|red at a place convenient, the <HI>Periaga</HI> kept Bu&s;king to and again, but could only di&s;cover a <HI>Reef of Ri&s;ing Shoals</HI> thereabouts, called <HI>The Boilers,</HI> which Ri&s;ing to be within Two or Three Foot of the Surface of the Sea, were yet &s;o &s;teep, that a Ship &s;triking on them, would immediately &s;ink down, who could &s;ay, <HI>how many Fa|thom?</HI> into the Ocean. Here they could get no other Pay for their long <HI>peeping</HI> among the <HI>Boilers,</HI> but only &s;uch as cau&s;ed them to think upon returning to their Captain, with the <HI>bad News</HI> of their total Di&s;appoint|ment. Neverthele&s;s, as they were upon the Return, one of the Men looking over the &s;ide of the <HI>Periaga,</HI> into the calm Water, he &s;pied a <HI>Sea Feather,</HI> growing as he judged, out of a Rock; whereupon they bad one of their <HI>Indians</HI> to Dive, and fetch this <HI>Feather,</HI> that they might however carry home <HI>&s;omething</HI> with
<PB N="12" REF="13">them, and make, at lea&s;t, as fair a Trinmph as <HI>Cali|gula</HI>'s. The <HI>Diver,</HI> bringing up the <HI>Feather,</HI> brought therewithal a &s;urprizing &s;tory, That he perceived a Number of <HI>Great Guns</HI> in the <HI>Watry World</HI> where he had found his <HI>Feather;</HI> the <HI>Report</HI> of which <HI>Great Guns</HI> exceedingly a&s;toni&s;hed the whole Company; and at once, turned their <HI>De&s;pondencies</HI> for their ill &s;ucce&s;s, in|to <HI>A&s;&s;urances,</HI> that they had now lit upon the <HI>True &s;pot</HI> of Ground which they had been looking for; and they were further confirmed in the&s;e <HI>A&s;&s;urances,</HI> when upon further Diving, the <HI>Indian</HI> fetcht up a <HI>Sow,</HI> as they &s;til'd it, or a Lump of Silver, worth perhaps, Two or Three Hundred Pounds. Upon this they prudently <HI>Buoy'd</HI> the place, that they might readily find it again; And they went back unto their Captain, whom for &s;ome while, they di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with nothing but &s;uch <HI>Bad News,</HI> as they formerly thought they mu&s;t have carri|ed him: Neverthele&s;s they &s;o &s;lipt in the Sow of Silver, on one &s;ide under the Table, where they were now &s;itting with the Captain, and hearing him ex|pre&s;s his Re&s;olutions to wait &s;till patiently upon the Providence of God under the&s;e Di&s;appointments, that when he &s;hould look on one &s;ide, he might &s;ee that <HI>Odd Thing</HI> before him. At la&s;t he <HI>&s;aw</HI> it; &s;eeing it, he cryed out with &s;ome Agony, <HI>Why? What is this? Whence comes this?</HI> And then, with changed Counte|nances, they told him <HI>how,</HI> and <HI>where</HI> they got it: <HI>Then,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>Thanks be to God! We are made;</HI> And &s;o, away they went, all hands to Work; wherein they had this one further piece of Remarkable Pro&s;perity, that whereas, if they had fir&s;t fallen upon that part of the <HI>Spani&s;h Wreck,</HI> where the Pieces of Eight had been &s;towed in Bags among the Balla&s;t, they had &s;een a more laborious, and le&s;s enriching time of it: Now, mo&s;t happily, they fir&s;t fell upon that Room in the <HI>Wreck,</HI> where the <HI>Bullion</HI> had been &s;tored up; and they &s;o pro&s;pered in this <HI>New Fi&s;hery,</HI> that in a little while they had, without the lo&s;s of any Man's Life, brought up <HI>Thirty Two Tuns</HI> of Silver; for it was now come to mea&s;uring of Silver by <HI>Tuns.</HI> Be&s;ides which, one <HI>Ad|derly</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="13">of <HI>Providence,</HI> who had formerly been very help|ful to Captain <HI>Phips</HI> in the Search of this <HI>Wreck,</HI> did upon former Agreement meet him now, with a little Ve&s;&s;el here; and <HI>he,</HI> with his few hands, took up about <HI>Six Tuns</HI> of Silver; whereof neverthele&s;s, he made &s;o little u&s;e, that in a year or two, he died at <HI>Bermudas,</HI> and as I have heard, he ran <HI>Di&s;tracled</HI> &s;ome while be|fore he died. Thus did there once again, come into the Light of the Sun, a Trea&s;ure which had been half an Hundred Years <HI>groaning under the Waters:</HI> And in this time, there was grown upon the Plate, a Cru&s;t like <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ime&s;tone,</HI> to the thickne&s;s of &s;everal Inches; which Cru&s;t being broken open, by Irons contrived for that purpo&s;e, they knockt out whole Bu&s;hels of ru&s;ty Pieces of Eight, which were grown thereinto. Be&s;ides that in|credible Trea&s;ure of Plate in various forms, thus fetch'd up, from &s;even or eight Fathom under Water, there were va&s;t Riches of <HI>Gold</HI> and <HI>Pearls</HI> and <HI>Jewels,</HI> which they al&s;o lit upon; and indeed, for a more Compre|hen&s;ive <HI>Invoice,</HI> I mu&s;t but &s;ummarily &s;ay, <HI>All that a</HI> Spani&s;h <HI>Frigate u&s;es to be enricht withal.</HI> Thus did they continue <HI>Fi&s;hing</HI> till their Provi&s;ions failing them, 'twas time to be gone; but before they went, Captain <HI>Phips</HI> cau&s;ed <HI>Adderly</HI> and his Folk to &s;wear, That they would none of them Di&s;cover the place of the <HI>Wreck,</HI> or come to the Place any more till the next Year, when he expected again to be there him&s;elf. And it was al&s;o Remarkable, that though the Sows came up &s;till &s;o fa&s;t, that on the very la&s;t Day of their being there, they took up <HI>Twenty,</HI> yet it was afterwards found, that they had in a manner wholly cleared that Room of the Ship, where tho&s;e <HI>Ma&s;&s;y things</HI> were Stowed.</P>
<P>But there was one extraordinary Di&s;tre&s;s which Captain <HI>Phips</HI> now found him&s;elf plunged into: For his Men were come out with him upon Seamens Wages, at &s;o much <HI>per</HI> Month; and when they &s;aw &s;uch va&s;t Litters of Silver <HI>Sows</HI> and <HI>Pigs,</HI> as they call them, come on Board them, at the Captains Call, they knew not how to bear it, that they &s;hould not <HI>&s;hare</HI> all among them&s;elves, and be gone to lead <HI>a &s;hort life and a merry,</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="14">in a Climate, where the Arre&s;t of tho&s;e that had hired them, &s;hould not reach them. In this terrible Di|&s;tre&s;s, he made his Vows unto Almighty God, that if the Lord would carry him &s;afe home to <HI>England,</HI> with what <HI>he</HI> had now given him, <HI>to &s;uck of the abundance of the Seas, and of the Trea&s;ures hid in the Sands,</HI> he would for ever Devote him&s;elf unto the Intere&s;ts of the Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and of his People, e&s;pecially in the <HI>Country</HI> which he did him&s;elf Originally belong unto. And he then u&s;ed all the obliging <HI>Arts</HI> imaginable, to make his Men true unto him, e&s;pecially by a&s;&s;uring them, that be&s;ides their <HI>Wages,</HI> they &s;hould have ample <HI>Re|quitals</HI> made unto them; which if the re&s;t of his Em|ployers would not agree unto, he would him&s;elf di&s;tri|bute his <HI>own &s;hare</HI> among them. Relying upon the Word of One, whom they had ever found worthy of their <HI>Love,</HI> and of their <HI>Tru&s;t,</HI> they declared them|&s;elves <HI>Content:</HI> But &s;till keeping a mo&s;t careful Eye upon them, he ha&s;tned back for <HI>England,</HI> with as much <HI>Money</HI> as he thought he could then &s;afely <HI>Tru&s;t</HI> his Ve&s;&s;el withal; not counting it &s;afe to &s;upply him&s;elf with nece&s;&s;ary Provi&s;ions at any nearer Port, and &s;o return unto the <HI>Wreck,</HI> by which delays, he wi&s;ely feared le&s;t all might be lo&s;t, more ways than one. Though he al&s;o left &s;o much behind him, that many from divers parts made very con&s;iderable Voyages of <HI>Gleanings</HI> after his <HI>Harve&s;t:</HI> which came to pa&s;s by certain <HI>Bermudians,</HI> compelling of <HI>Adderly</HI>'s Boy, whom they <HI>&s;pirited</HI> away with them, to tell them the exact place where the <HI>Wreck</HI> was to be found. Captain <HI>Phips</HI> now coming up to <HI>London,</HI> in the Year 1687. with near <HI>Three Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds &s;terling</HI> aboard him, did acquit him&s;elf with &s;uch an Exemplary Ho|ne&s;ty, that partly by his fulfilling his A&s;&s;urances to the Scamen, and partly by his exact and punctual Care to have his Employers defrauded of nothing that might con&s;cientiou&s;ly belong unto them, he had le&s;s than <HI>&s;ixteen Thou&s;and pounds</HI> left unto him&s;elf: As an acknow|ledgment of which <HI>Hone&s;ty</HI> in him, the Duke of <HI>Albe|marl</HI> made unto his Wife, whom he never &s;aw, a Pre|&s;ent

Accordingly the King, in con&s;ideration of the Service done by him, in bringing &s;uch a Trea|&s;ure into the Nation, conferr'd upon him the Honour of <HI>Knighthood;</HI> And if we now reckon him, <HI>A Knight of the Golden Fleece,</HI> the Stile might pretend unto &s;ome circum&s;tances that would ju&s;tifie it.

<P>Thus, he was worthy to pa&s;s among the In&s;tances of <HI>Heroick Vertue</HI> for that <HI>Humility</HI> that &s;till Adorned him: He was <HI>Rai&s;ed,</HI> and though he prudently ac|commodated him&s;elf to the <HI>Quality</HI> whereto he was now <HI>Rai&s;ed,</HI> yet none could perceive him to be <HI>Lift|ed up.</HI> Or, if this were not <HI>Heroick,</HI> yet I will Relate one Thing more of him, that mu&s;t certainly be accounted &s;o.

<P>It was under the Re&s;entments of the&s;e Things, that Sir <HI>Williom Phips,</HI> returned into <HI>England,</HI> in the year 1688.

But when Sir <HI>William</HI> arrived at <HI>New-England,</HI> he found a New Face of Things; For about an Hun|dred Indians in the <HI>Ea&s;tern parts</HI> of the Country, had unaccountably begun a War upon the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> in <HI>July,</HI> 1688. and though the Governour then in the <HI>We&s;tern Parts,</HI> had immediate Advice of it, yet he not only delayed and neglected all that was nece&s;&s;ary for the <HI>Publick Defence,</HI> but al&s;o when he at La&s;t returned, he manife&s;ted a mo&s;t Furious Di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t tho&s;e of the Council, and all others that had forwarded any one thing for the &s;ecurity of the Inhabitants; while at the &s;ame time, he di&s;patched &s;ome of his Creatures upon &s;ecret Errands unto <HI>Canada,</HI> and &s;et at Liberty &s;ome of the mo&s;t Murderous <HI>Indians</HI> which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had &s;eized upon.</P>
<P>This Conduct of the Governour, which is in a <HI>Printed</HI> Remon&s;trance of &s;ome of the Be&s;t Gentlemen in the Council, complained of, did extreamly di&s;&s;atisfy the <HI>Su&s;picious</HI> People: Who were doubtle&s;s more

<P>BEHOLD the great Things which were done by the Sovereign God, for a Per&s;on, once, as little in his <HI>own Eyes,</HI> as in <HI>other Men's.</HI> All the Returns which he had hitherto made unto the <HI>God of his Mercies,</HI> were but Preliminaries to what remain to be Related. It has been the Cu&s;tom in the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> &s;till to expect from &s;uch Per&s;ons, as they admitted unto con&s;tant Communion with them, That they do not only Publickly and Solemnly <HI>Declare</HI> their <HI>Con&s;ent</HI> unto the <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> and particularly to tho&s;e Duties of it, wherein a <HI>particular Church-&s;tate</HI> is more immediately concerned, but al&s;o fir&s;t Relate unto the <HI>Pa&s;tors,</HI> and by them unto the <HI>Brethren,</HI> the &s;pecial Impre&s;&s;ions which the <HI>Grace</HI> of God has made upon their Souls in bringing them to this <HI>Con&s;ent.</HI> By this <HI>Cu&s;tom</HI> and <HI>Caution,</HI> though they can|not
<PB N="27" REF="20">keep <HI>Hypocrites</HI> from their Sacred Fellow&s;hip, yet they go as far as they can, to render and pre&s;erve them|&s;elves <HI>Churches of Saints,</HI> and they do further very much <HI>Edifie one another.</HI> When Sir <HI>William Phips</HI> was now re|turned unto his <HI>own Hou&s;e,</HI> he began to bethink him&s;elf, like <HI>David,</HI> concerning the <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> of the <HI>God,</HI> who had &s;urrounded him with &s;o many Favours in <HI>his own;</HI> and accordingly he applied him&s;elf unto the <HI>North Church</HI> in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> that with his open Profe&s;&s;ion of his hearty Sub|jection to the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, he might have the <HI>Ordinances</HI> and the <HI>Priviledges</HI> of the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> ad|ded unto his other Enjoyments. One thing that quick|ned his Re&s;olution to do what might be in this Matter expected from him, was a Pa&s;&s;age which he heard from a Mini&s;ter, Preaching on the Title of the <HI>Fifty Fir&s;t</HI> P&s;alm: <HI>To make a publick and an open Profe&s;&s;ion of Repen|tance, is a thing not mi&s;-becoming the greate&s;t Man alive. It is an Honour to be found among the Repenting People of God, though they be in Circum&s;tances never &s;o full of Suffer|ing. A famous Knight going with other Chri&s;tians to be Crowned with Martyrdom, ob&s;erved, That his Fellow-Suffer|ers were in Chains, from which the Sacrificers had, becau&s;e of his Quality, excus'd him; whereupon he demanded, that he might wear Chains as well as they.</HI> For, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> I would be a Knight of that Order too; <HI>There is among our &s;elves a repenting People of God, who by their Con|&s;e&s;&s;ions at their Admi&s;&s;ions to His Table, do &s;ignalize their being &s;o; and Thanks be to God, that we have &s;o little of &s;uffering in our Circum&s;tances. But if any Man count him|&s;elf grown too big to be a</HI> Knight of that Order, <HI>the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t Him&s;elf, will one Day be a&s;hamed of that Man!</HI> Upon this Excitation, Sir <HI>William Phips</HI> made his Ad|dre&s;s unto a <HI>Corgregational-Church,</HI> and he had therein One Thing to propound unto him&s;elf, which few Per&s;ons of his Age, &s;o well &s;atisfied in <HI>Infant-Bapti&s;m</HI> as he was, have then to Ask for. Indeed, in the Primitive Times, although the <HI>Lawfulne&s;s</HI> of <HI>Infant-Bapti&s;m,</HI> or the Pre|cept and Pattern of <HI>Scripture</HI> for it, was never &s;o much as once made a Que&s;tion, yet we find <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> was fre|quently delayed by Per&s;ons, upon &s;everal &s;uper&s;titious
<PB N="28" REF="21">and unrea&s;onable Accounts, again&s;t which we have &s;uch Fathers as <HI>Gregory Nazianzen, Gregory Ny&s;&s;en, Ba&s;il, Chry|&s;o&s;tom, Ambro&s;e,</HI> and others, employing a variety of Argument. But Sir <HI>William Phips</HI> had hitherto delayed his <HI>Bapti&s;m,</HI> becau&s;e the Years of his Child-hood were &s;pent where there was no &s;ettled Mini&s;ter, and there|fore, he was now not only willing to attain a good Satis|faction of his own Internal and Practical <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> before his receiving that <HI>Mark</HI> thereof, but he was al|&s;o willing to receive it among tho&s;e <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> that &s;eemed mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible of the <HI>Bonds</HI> which it laid them under. Offering him&s;elf therefore, fir&s;t unto the <HI>Bap|ti&s;m,</HI> and then unto the <HI>Supper</HI> of the Lord, he pre&s;ent|ed unto the Pa&s;tor of the Church, with his own <HI>Hand|writing,</HI> the following <HI>In&s;trument;</HI> which becau&s;e of the Exemplary <HI>Devotion</HI> therein expre&s;&s;ed, and the Re|markable <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> which it gives of &s;everal Occurrences in his Life, I will here Faithfully Tran&s;cribe it, without adding &s;o much as one Word unto it.</P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">The Fir&s;t of God's making me &s;en&s;ible of my <HI>Sins,</HI> was in the year 1674. by Hearing your Father Preach concerning, <HI>the Day of Trouble near.</HI> It plea&s;ed Almighty God to &s;mite me with a Deep &s;ence of my mi&s;erable Condition, who had Lived until then, in the World, and had <HI>Done nothing for God.</HI> I did then begin to think <HI>What I &s;hould Do to be &s;aved?</HI> and did bewail my <HI>Youthful Days,</HI> which I had &s;pent <HI>in vain:</HI> I did think that I would begin to mind The <HI>Things of God.</HI> Being then &s;ome time, under your Father's Mini&s;try, much troubled with my <HI>Burden,</HI> but thinking on that Scripture, <HI>Come unto me, you that are weary and heavy Laden, and I will Give you Re&s;t.</HI> I had &s;ome Thoughts of Drawing as near to the Communion of the Lord <HI>Je&s;us</HI> as I could, But the Ruines, which the <HI>Indian Wars</HI> brought on my Affairs, and the Entanglements which my following the <HI>Sea,</HI> laid upon me, hindred my pur&s;uing the welfare of my own Soul, as I ought to have done.

<P>THE Addition of this <HI>French</HI> Colony to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Dominion, was no more than a <HI>little &s;tep</HI> towards a <HI>greater Action,</HI> which was fir&s;t in the De&s;ign of Sir <HI>William Phips,</HI> and which was, indeed, the <HI>Greate&s;t Acti|on</HI> that ever the <HI>New-Englanders</HI> Attempted. There was a time, when the <HI>Phili&s;tines</HI> had made &s;ome Inroads and A&s;&s;aults from the <HI>North-ward,</HI> upon the Skirts of <HI>Go|&s;hen,</HI> where the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> had a Re&s;idence, before their coming out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> The <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> and e&s;pecially that
<PB N="33" REF="23">Active Colony of the <HI>Ephraimites,</HI> were willing to Re|venge the&s;e Injuries upon their wicked Neighbours; they pre&s;umed them&s;elves Powerful and Numerous enough to Encounter the <HI>Canaanites,</HI> even in their own Country; and they formed a brisk <HI>Expedition,</HI> but came off unhappy Lo&s;ers in it; the <HI>Jewi&s;h Rabbins</HI> tell us, they lo&s;t no le&s;s than <HI>Eight Thou&s;and</HI> Men.

<P>It was <HI>Canada</HI> that was the chief Source of <HI>New-Eng|land</HI>'s Mi&s;eries. <HI>There</HI> was the main Strength of the <HI>French; There</HI> the <HI>Indians</HI> were mo&s;tly &s;upplied with Ammunition; <HI>Thence</HI> I&s;&s;ued Parties of Men, who uni|ting with the Salvages, barbarou&s;ly murdered many In|nocent <HI>New-Enlanders,</HI> without any Provocation on the <HI>New-Engli&s;h</HI> part, except this, that <HI>New-England</HI> had Proclaimed King <HI>William,</HI> and Q. <HI>Mary,</HI> which they &s;aid were <HI>&V;&s;urpers;</HI> And, as <HI>Cato</HI> could make no Speech in the Senate, without that Conclu&s;ion, <HI>Delenda e&s;t Carthago;</HI> &s;o it was the general Conclu&s;ion of all that Argued &s;en&s;ibly, about the &s;afety of that Country, <HI>Ca|nada mu&s;t be Reduced.</HI> It then became the concurring Re&s;olution of all <HI>New-England,</HI> with <HI>New-York,</HI> to make a Vigorous Attack upon <HI>Canada</HI> at once, both by Sea and Land.</P>
<P>And a Fleet was accordingly fitted out from <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> under the Command of Sir <HI>William Phips,</HI> to fall upon <HI>Quebeque,</HI> the chief City of <HI>Canada.</HI> They waited until <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> for &s;ome Stores of War from <HI>England,</HI> whither they had &s;ent for that purpo&s;e, early in the Spring;

How|ever, the Ships being taken up, and the Men on board, his u&s;ual Courage would not permit him to De&s;i&s;t from the Enterprize; but he &s;et Sail from <HI>Hull</HI> near <HI>Bo&s;ton, Augu&s;t</HI> 9. 1690. with a Fleet of <HI>Thirty two</HI> Ships and Tenders; whereof one, called <HI>the Six Friends,</HI> carrying Fourty Four great Guns, and Two Hundred Men, was <HI>Admiral.</HI> Sir <HI>William</HI> dividing the Fleet into &s;everal Squadrons, whereof there was <HI>the Six Friends,</HI> Captain <HI>Gregory Sugars</HI> Commander, with Eleven more of the Admiral's Squadron, of which one was al&s;o a Capital Ship, namely, <HI>The John and Thomas,</HI> Captain <HI>Thomas Car|ter</HI> Commander; Of the <HI>Vice-Admirals,</HI> the <HI>Swan,</HI> Cap|tain <HI>Thomas Gilbert</HI> Commander, with Nine more; Of the <HI>Rear-Admirals,</HI> the <HI>America-Merchant,</HI> Captain <HI>Jo|&s;eph Eldridge</HI> Commander, with Nine more; and above Twenty Hundred Men on Board the whole Fleet: He &s;o happily managed his Charge, that they every one of them Arrived &s;afe at Anchor before <HI>Quebeck,</HI> although they had as dangerous, and almo&s;t untrodden a <HI>Path,</HI> to take <HI>&V;n-Piloted,</HI> for the whole Voyage, as ever any Voyage was undertaken with. Some &s;mall <HI>French Prizes</HI> he took by the way, and &s;et up <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colours upon the Coa&s;t, here and there, as he went along; and be|fore the Month of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> was out, he had &s;pent &s;everal Days as far onward of his Voyage, as between the I&s;land of <HI>Anteco&s;ta,</HI> and the <HI>Main.</HI> But when they entred the mighty River of <HI>Canada,</HI> &s;uch adver&s;e Winds encoun|tred the Fleet, that they were <HI>Three Weeks</HI> di&s;patching the way, which might otherwi&s;e have been gone in <HI>Three Days,</HI> and it was the Fifth of <HI>October,</HI> when a fre&s;h Breeze coming up at <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> carried them along by the <HI>North</HI> Shore, up to the I&s;le of <HI>Orleans;</HI> and then haling <HI>Southerly,</HI> they pa&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> end of that I&s;land, with the whole Fleet approaching the City of <HI>Quebeck.</HI> This lo&s;s of Time, which made it &s;o late before the Fleet could get into the Country, where a cold and
<PB N="35" REF="24">fierce <HI>Winter</HI> was already very far advanced, gave no very <HI>good</HI> Pro&s;pect of Succe&s;s to the Expedition; but that which gave a much <HI>wor&s;e,</HI> was a mo&s;t horrid <HI>Mi&s;|management,</HI> which had, the mean while, happened in the <HI>We&s;t.</HI> For a Thou&s;and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> from <HI>New-York,</HI> and <HI>Albany,</HI> and <HI>Connecticut,</HI> with Fifteen Hundred <HI>Indians,</HI> were to have gone over-Land, in the <HI>We&s;t,</HI> and fallen upon <HI>Mount-Royal,</HI> while the Fleet was to Vi&s;it <HI>Quebeck</HI> in the <HI>Ea&s;t;</HI> and no Expedition could have been better laid than <HI>This,</HI> which was thus contrived.

<P>Had this <HI>We&s;tern Army</HI> done but &s;o much as con|tinued at the <HI>Lake,</HI> the Diver&s;ion thereby given to the <HI>French</HI> Quartered at <HI>Mount-Royal,</HI> would have ren|dered the Conque&s;t of <HI>Quebeck</HI> ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">e and certain; but the Governour of <HI>Canada</HI> being Informed of the Re|treat made by the <HI>We&s;tern</HI>-Army, had opportunity, by the cro&s;s Winds that kept back the Fleet, unhap|pily to get the whole Strength of all the Country into the City, before the Fleet could come up unto it.

And this Evening, a <HI>French</HI> De|&s;erter coming to them, a&s;&s;ured them, that Nine Hun|dred Men were on their March from <HI>Quebeck</HI> to meet them, already pa&s;&s;ed a little Rivulet that lay at the end of the City, but &s;eeing them Land &s;o &s;uddenly, and &s;o valiantly run down tho&s;e that fir&s;t Encountred them, they had Retreated: Neverthele&s;s, That Count <HI>Fron|tenac</HI> was come down to <HI>Quebeck,</HI> with no fewer than <HI>Thirty Hundred</HI> Men to defend the City, having left but <HI>fifty</HI> Souldiers to defend <HI>Mount Real,</HI> becau&s;e they had under&s;tood, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Army on that &s;ide, were gone back to <HI>Albany.</HI> Notwith&s;tanding this di&s;piriting Information, the common Souldiers did with much ve|hemency Beg and Pray, that they might be Led on, profe&s;&s;ing, that they had rather lo&s;e their Lives on the &s;pot, than fail of taking the City; but the more wary Commanders, con&s;idered how ra&s;h a thing it would be, for about Fourteen Hundred Raw Men, tired with a long Voyage, to a&s;&s;ault more than Twice as many Ex|pert Souldiers, who were <HI>Galli in &s;uo &s;terquilinio,</HI> or <HI>Cocks Crowing on their own Dunghil.</HI> They were, in truth, now gotten into the grievous Ca&s;e, which <HI>Livy</HI> de&s;cribes, when he &s;ays, <HI>Ibi grave e&s;t Bellum gerere, ubi non con&s;i&s;tendi aut procedendi locus; quocunque aspexeris Ho&s;tilia &s;unt omnia;</HI> Look on one &s;ide or 'tother, all was full of <HI>Ho&s;tile Difficulties.</HI> And indeed, whatever Po|pular Clamour has been made again&s;t any of the Com|manders, it is apparent, that they acted con&s;iderately, in making a <HI>Pau&s;e</HI> upon what was before them; and they did a greater kindne&s;s to their Souldiers than they have &s;ince been thanked for. But in this time, General <HI>Phips</HI> and his Men of War, with their <HI>Canvas, Wings,</HI> flew clo&s;e up unto the We&s;t-end of the City, and there he behaved him&s;elf with the Greate&s;t Brave|ry imaginable; nor did the other Men of War forbear

<L>In Flames of Lightning, and in Clouds of Smoke:</L></Q></P>
<P>He lay within <HI>Pi&s;tol-&s;hot</HI> of the Enemies Cannon, and beat them from thence, and very much Batter'd the Town, having his own Ship &s;hot through in an hun|dred places, with <HI>four and twenty Pounders,</HI> and yet, but one Man was killed, and only two mortally wounded aboard him, in this hot Engagement, which continued the greate&s;t part of that Night, and &s;everal hours of the Day en&s;uing. But wondring, that he &s;aw no <HI>Sig|nal</HI> of any Effective Action a&s;hoar, at the Ea&s;t end of the City, he &s;ent that he might know the condition of the Army there; and received An&s;wer, That &s;everal of the Men were &s;o frozen in their Hands and Feet, as to be di&s;abled from &s;ervice, and others were apace fall|ing &s;ick of the <HI>Small-Pox.</HI> Whereupon he order'd them on Board immediately to refre&s;h them&s;elves, and he in|tended then, to have renew'd his Attack upon the City, in the Method of Landing his Men in the face of it, under the &s;helter of his Great Guns; having to that purpo&s;e, provided al&s;o, a con&s;derable number of well-&s;haped <HI>Wheel-Barrows,</HI> each of them carrying Two <HI>Pe|tarraro</HI>'s a piece, to March before the Men and make the Enemy fly, with as much Contempt as overwhelmed the <HI>Phili&s;tines,</HI> when undone by <HI>Foxes</HI> with <HI>Torches</HI> in their Tails; (remembred in an Anniver&s;ary Diver&s;ion, every <HI>April,</HI> among the Ancient <HI>Romans,</HI> taught by the <HI>Phenicians.</HI>)</P>
<P>While the Mea&s;ures to be further taken, were debat|ing, there was made an Exchange of Pri&s;oners, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> having taken &s;everal of the <HI>French</HI> in divers acti|ons, and the <HI>French</HI> having in their Hands divers of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> whom the <HI>Indians</HI> had brought Captives unto them.

<PB N="41" REF="27"><HI>Quebeck,</HI> or if they had mi&s;&s;ed of doing it by &s;torm, they knew that they might, by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them&s;elves of the I&s;le of <HI>Orleans,</HI> in a little while, have &s;tarved them out. Incredible Damage they might indeed, have done to the Enemy, before they Embarked, but they were will|ing to pre&s;erve the more undefen&s;ible parts of the Country, in &s;uch a condition, as might more &s;en&s;ibly encourage the Submi&s;&s;ion of the Inhabitants, unto the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> who&s;e Protection was de&s;ired by &s;o many of them. And &s;till they were loth to Play for any le&s;&s;er Game than the immediate Surrender of <HI>Que|beck</HI> it &s;elf.

<P>Thus, by an evident <HI>Hand of Heaven,</HI> &s;ending one unavoidable Di&s;a&s;ter after another, as well-formed an Enterprize, as perhaps was ever made by the <HI>New-Eng|landers,</HI> mo&s;t unhappily mi&s;carried; and General <HI>Phips</HI> underwent a very mortifying Di&s;appointment of a De&s;ign, which his Mind was, as much as ever any, &s;et upon.

He al&s;o relieved the unea&s;ine&s;s of his Mind, by con&s;idering, that his Voyage to <HI>Canada,</HI> diverted from his Country an <HI>Horrible Tempest</HI> from an Army of <HI>Bo&s;s-Lopers,</HI> which had prepar'd them&s;elves, as 'tis affirmed, that Winter, to fall upon the <HI>New-Engli&s;h</HI> Co|lonies, and by falling on them, would probably have laid no little part of the Country de&s;olate.

The third Night they were mo&s;t lov|ingly Treated, at the Hou&s;e of a very Godly Man, from whom, when they went in the Morning, the An|gel meeting a Servant of his, threw him over the Bridge into the Water, where he was drowned.

By the &s;eventh of <HI>May,</HI> &s;eeing no Land, but having once more &s;pent all their Provi&s;ion, they were grown almo&s;t wholly hopele&s;s of Deliverance, but then a Fi&s;hing Shallop of Cape <HI>Ann,</HI> came up with them, fifteen Leagues to the Ea&s;tward of that Cape. And yet, be|fore they got in, they had &s;o Tempe&s;tuous a Night, that they much feared peri&s;hing upon the Rocks, after all: But God carried them into <HI>Boston</HI> Harbour the Ninth of <HI>May,</HI> unto the great &s;urpri&s;e of their Friends, that were in Mourning for them: And there furni&s;h|ing them&s;elves with a Ve&s;&s;el fit for their Undertaking, they took a Cour&s;e in a few Weeks more to fetch home their Brethren, that they left behind them at <HI>Anteco&s;ta.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Your Subjects there, have been willing to venture their Lives, that they may enlarge Your Dominions; The</HI> Expe|dition <HI>to</HI> Canada, <HI>was a great and Noble &V;ndertaking.</HI></P>

<PB N="57" REF="35">
<P>Two Days after this, the King, upon what was propo&s;ed by certain Lords, was very inqui&s;itive, whe|ther He might without breach of Law, &s;et a Gover|nour over <HI>New-England;</HI> whereto the Lord Chief Ju|&s;tice, and &s;ome others of the Council, an&s;wered, That whatever might be the Merit of the Cau&s;e, ina&s;much as the <HI>Charter</HI> of <HI>New-England,</HI> &s;tood vaca|ted by a Judgment again&s;t them, it was in the King's Power to put them under what <HI>Form of Go|vernment</HI> He &s;hould think be&s;t for them.</P>
<P>The King then &s;aid, <Q REND="margQuotes">That He believed it would be for the Advantage of the People, in that Co|lony, to be under a Governour appointed by Him|&s;elf: Neverthele&s;s (becau&s;e of what Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> had &s;poken to Him) He would have the Agents of <HI>New-England</HI> nominate a Per&s;on, that &s;hould be a|greeable unto the Inclinations of the People there; and notwith&s;tanding this, He would have Charter-Priviledges re&s;tored and confirmed unto them.</Q></P>
<P>The Day following, the King began another Voy|age to <HI>Holland;</HI> and when the Attorney General's Draught of a Charter, according to what he took to be his Maje&s;ty's Mind, as expre&s;&s;ed in Council, was pre&s;ented at the <HI>Council-Board,</HI> on the eighth of <HI>June,</HI> &s;ome Objections then made, procured an Or|der to prepare <HI>Minutes</HI> for another Draught, which deprived the <HI>New-Englanders</HI> of &s;everal <HI>E&s;&s;ential Pri|viledges</HI> in their other Charter. Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> put in his Objections, and vehemently prote&s;ted, that he would &s;ooner part with his <HI>Life,</HI> than con&s;ent unto tho&s;e <HI>Minutes,</HI> or any thing el&s;e, that &s;hould infringe any Liberty or Priviledge of Right belonging unto his Country; but he was an&s;wered, That the Agents of <HI>New-England</HI> were not <HI>Plenipotentiaries</HI> from ano|ther Soveraign State, and that, if they would not &s;ubmit unto the King's Plea&s;ure in the &s;ettlement of the Country, they mu&s;t <HI>take what would follow.</HI></P>
<PB N="58" REF="36">
<P>The di&s;&s;atisfactory <HI>Minutes</HI> were, by Mr. <HI>Mather</HI>'s Indu&s;try, &s;ent over unto the King in <HI>Flanders;</HI> and the Mini&s;ters of State then with the King were ear|ne&s;tly applied unto, that every mi&s;take about the good Settlement of <HI>New-England</HI> might be prevent|ed; and the Queen Her &s;elf, with Her own Royal Hand, wrote unto the King, that the Charter of <HI>New-England</HI> might either pa&s;s as it was drawn by the Attorney General, or be deferred until His own Return.</P>
<P>But after all, His Maje&s;ties Principal Secretary of State received a Signification of the King's Plea&s;ure, That the Charter of <HI>New-England</HI> &s;hould run in the Main Points of it, as it was now granted: Only there were &s;everal Important Articles, which Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> by his unwearied Sollicitations obtained afterwards to be in&s;erted.</P>
<P>There were &s;ome now of the Opinion, That in|&s;tead of &s;ubmitting to this New Settlement, they &s;hould, in Hopes of getting a Rever&s;ion of the Judg|ment again&s;t the Old Charter, declare to the Mini|ni&s;ters of State, That they had rather have no Char|ter at all, than &s;uch an one as was now propo&s;ed unto Acceptance. But Mr. <HI>Mather,</HI> advi&s;ing with many unprejudiced Per&s;ons, and Men of the greate&s;t Abilities in the Kingdom, <HI>Noblemen, Gentlemen, Di|vines,</HI> and <HI>Lawyers,</HI> they all agreed, That it was not only a lawful, but all Circum&s;tances then con&s;i|dered, a needful Thing, and a part of Duty and Wi&s;dom, to accept what was now offered, and that a peremptory Refu&s;al, would not only bring an In|conveniency, but a Fatal, and perhaps a Final Ruine upon the Country; whereof Mankind would lay the blame upon the Agents.</P>
<P>It was argued, That &s;uch a Submi&s;&s;ion was no Surrender of any thing; That the Judgment, not in the Court of Kings <HI>Bench,</HI> but in <HI>Chancery</HI> again&s;t the Old Charter, &s;tanding on Record, the Pattent
<PB N="59" REF="36">was thereby Annihilated; That all attempts to have the Judgment again&s;t the Old Charter, taken off, would be altogether in vain, as Men and Things were then di&s;po&s;ed.</P>
<P>It was further argued. That the Ancient Charter of <HI>New-England,</HI> was in the Opinion of the Lawyers, very Defective, as to &s;everal <HI>Powers,</HI> which yet were ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the Plantation: It gave the Government there no more Power, than the Corporations have in <HI>England;</HI> Power in Capital Ca&s;es was not therein particular|ly expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>It mentioned not, an <HI>Hou&s;e of Deputies,</HI> or, an <HI>A&s;&s;embly of Repre&s;entatives;</HI> the Governour and Company had thereby (they &s;aid) no Power to impo&s;e Taxes on the Inhabitants, that were not Free|men, or to erect Courts of Admiralty. Without &s;uch Powers, the Colony could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t, and yet the be&s;t Friends that <HI>New-England</HI> had, of Per&s;ons mo&s;t learned in the Law, profe&s;&s;ed, that &s;uppo&s;e the Judgment again&s;t the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et</HI>-Charter might be Rever&s;ed, yet, if they &s;hould again Exert &s;uch Pow|ers, as they did before the <HI>Quo Warranto</HI> again&s;t their Charter, a new Writ of <HI>Scire Facias</HI> would undoub|tedly be i&s;&s;ued out again&s;t them.</P>
<P>It was yet further argued, That if an Act of Par|liament &s;hould have Rever&s;ed the Judgment again&s;t the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et-Charter,</HI> without a grant of &s;ome o|ther Advantages, the whole Territory had been, on many Accounts, very mi&s;erably Incommoded: The Province of <HI>Main,</HI> with <HI>Hamp&s;hire</HI> would have been taken from them; and <HI>Plymouth</HI> would have been annexed unto <HI>New-York;</HI> &s;o, that this Colony would have been &s;queezed into an <HI>Atom,</HI> and not only have been render'd <HI>In&s;ignificant</HI> in it's Trade, but by ha|ving it's Militia al&s;o, which was ve&s;ted in the King, taken away, it's <HI>In&s;ignificancies</HI> would have become, out of mea&s;ure, humbling; whereas now, in&s;tead of
<PB N="60" REF="37">&s;eeing any Relief by Act of Parliament, they would have been put under a Governour, with a Com|mi&s;&s;ion, whereby ill Men, and the King's and Coun|try's Enemies, might probably have crept into Op|portunities to have done ten thou&s;and ill Things, and have treated the be&s;t Men in the Land, after a very uncomfortable Manner.</P>
<P>It was la&s;tly, argued, That by the New Charter very great Priviledges were granted unto <HI>New-Eng|land;</HI> and, in &s;ome re&s;pects greater, than what they formerly enjoyed. The <HI>Colony</HI> is now made a <HI>Pro|vince,</HI> and their General Court, has, with the King's Approbation, as much Power, in <HI>New-England,</HI> as the King and Parliament have in <HI>England.</HI> They have all <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liberties, and can be touched by no Law, by no Tax, but of their own making. All the Li|berties of their Holy Religion are for ever &s;ecured, and their Titles to their Lands, once, for want of &s;ome Forms of legal Conveyance, conte&s;ted, are now confirmed unto them. If an ill Governour &s;hould happen to be impo&s;ed on them, what Hurt could he do to them? None, except they them&s;elves plea&s;ed; for he cannot make one Coun&s;ellour, or one Judge, or one Ju&s;tice, or one Sheriff to &s;erve his Turn: Di&s;advantages enough, one would think, to di&s;cou|rage any ill Governour from de&s;iring to be Stati|oned in tho&s;e unea&s;ie Regions. The People have a Negative upon all the Executive Part of the Civil Government, as well as the Legi&s;lative, which is a va&s;t Priviledge, enjoyed by no other Plantation in <HI>America,</HI> nor by <HI>Ireland,</HI> no, nor hitherto by <HI>Eng|land</HI> it &s;elf. Why &s;hould all of this Good be refu|&s;ed, or de&s;pi&s;ed, becau&s;e of &s;omewhat not &s;o Good attending it? The De&s;pi&s;ers of &s;o much Good, will certainly de&s;erve a Cen&s;ure, not unlike that of <HI>Cau|&s;abon,</HI> upon &s;ome who did not value what that learn|ed Man counted highly valuable, <HI>Vix illis optari quid. quam pejus pote&s;t, quam ut fatuitate &s;ua fruantur:</HI>

<P>WHEN <HI>Titus Flaminius</HI> had freed the poor <HI>Gre|cians</HI> from the Bondage which had long oppre&s;&s;ed them, and the Herald Proclaimed among them the Articles of their Freedom, they cryed out, <HI>A Saviour! a Saviour!</HI> with &s;uch loud Acclamations, that the very <HI>Birds</HI> fell down from Heaven, a&s;toni&s;h'd at the Cry.

<P>And as the Obliged People thus gave <HI>Thanks</HI> unto the God of Heaven, &s;o they &s;ent an Addre&s;s of <HI>Thanks</HI> unto Their Maje&s;ties, with other Letters of <HI>Thanks</HI> unto &s;ome Chief Mini&s;ters of State, for the <HI>Favoura|ble A&s;pect</HI> herein ca&s;t upon the Province.</P>
<P>Nor were the People mi&s;taken, when they promi&s;ed them&s;elves all the Kindne&s;s imaginable from this <HI>Go|vernour,</HI> and expected, <HI>&V;nder his &s;hadow we &s;hall live ea&s;ie among the Heathen:</HI> Why might they not look for <HI>Halcyon</HI>-days, when they had &s;uch a <HI>Kings-Fi&s;her</HI> for their Governour?</P>
<P>Governour <HI>Phips</HI> had, as every Rai&s;ed and U&s;eful Per&s;on mu&s;t have, his <HI>envious Enemies;</HI> but the pale&s;t Envy of them, who turned their wor&s;t Enmity upon him, could not hinder them from confe&s;&s;ing, <HI>That ac|cording to the best of his Apprehen&s;ion, he ever &s;ought the good of his Country:</HI> His Country quickly felt this on innumerable Occa&s;ions; and they had it eminently demon&s;trated, as well in his promoting and Approving the Councils Choice of good <HI>Judges, Ju&s;tices</HI> and <HI>She|riffs,</HI>
<PB N="64" REF="39">which being once e&s;tabli&s;hed, no <HI>Succe&s;&s;our</HI> could remove them, as in his urging the <HI>General A&s;&s;embly</HI> to make them&s;elves happy by preparing a Body of Good Laws, as fa&s;t as they could, which being pa&s;&s;ed by him in his Time, could not be nulled by any o|ther after him.</P>
<P>He would often &s;peak to the Members of the Ge|neral A&s;&s;embly, in &s;uch Terms as the&s;e, <HI>Gentlemen, you may make your &s;elves, as ea&s;ie as you will for ever; con&s;ider what may have any tendency to your welfare; and you may be &s;ure that whatever Bills you offer to me con&s;i&s;tent with the Honour and Intere&s;t of the Crown, I'll pa&s;s them readily; I do but &s;eek Opportunities to &s;erve you; had it not been for the &s;ake of this thing, I had never accepted the Government of this Province; and when ever you have &s;ettled &s;uch a Body of good Laws, that no Per&s;on coming after me, may make you unea&s;ie, I &s;hall de&s;ire not one Day longer to continue in the Government.</HI> Accordingly, he ever pa&s;&s;ed every Act for the welfare of the Province propo&s;ed unto him; and in&s;tead of ever putting them upon Buy|ing his A&s;&s;ent unto any good Act, he was much forwarder to give it, than they were to a&s;k it: Nor indeed, had the <HI>Hunger of a Salary,</HI> any &s;uch Impre&s;&s;ion upon him, as to make him decline doing all po&s;&s;ible Service, for the Publick while he was not &s;ure of having any proportionable, or honourable acknowledgments.</P>
<P>But yet he minded the Pre&s;ervation of the King's Rights, with as careful and faithful a Zeal, as be|came a good Steward for the Crown: And, indeed, he &s;tudied nothing more, than to ob&s;erve &s;uch a Temper in all things, as to extingui&s;h what others have gone to di&s;tingui&s;h; even the Pernicious Noti|on of a &s;eparate Intere&s;t. There was a Time, when the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, was infe&s;ted with a va&s;t number of Governours, who were infamous for Infi|nite Avarice and Villany; and referring to this Time,
<PB N="65" REF="39">the Apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> had a Vi&s;ion of, <HI>People killed with the Bea&s;ts of the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>But Sir <HI>William Phips</HI> was none of tho&s;e Gover|nours; wonderfully contrary to this wretchedne&s;s, was the Happine&s;s of <HI>New-England,</HI> when they had Governour <HI>Phips,</HI> u&s;ing the tenderne&s;s of a Father towards the People, and being of the Opinion, <HI>Di|tare magis e&s;&s;e Regium qu&agrave;m Dite&s;cere,</HI> that it was a braver Thing to enrich the People, than to grow rich him&s;elf. A <HI>Father,</HI> I &s;aid; and what if I had &s;aid, an <HI>Angel</HI> too. If I &s;hould from <HI>Clemens Alex|andrinus</HI> from <HI>Theodoret,</HI> and from <HI>Jerom,</HI> and others among the Ancients, as well as from <HI>Calvin</HI> and <HI>Bucan,</HI> and <HI>Peter Martyr,</HI> and <HI>Chemnitius</HI> and <HI>Bullin|ger,</HI> and a thou&s;and more among the <HI>Moderns,</HI> bring Authorities for the A&s;&s;ertion, <HI>That each Coun|try and Province, is under the &s;pecial care of &s;ome An|gel, by a &s;ingular Deputation of Heaven a&s;&s;igned there|unto,</HI> I could back them with a far greater Autho|rity than any of them all. The Scripture it &s;elf does plainly a&s;&s;ert it: And hence the mo&s;t Learned <HI>Grotius,</HI> writing of <HI>Common-Wealths,</HI> has a pa&s;&s;age to this purpo&s;e, <HI>His &s;ingulis, &s;uos Attributos, e&s;&s;e Angelos, ex Daniele, magno con&s;en&s;u, &amp; Judaei &amp; Chri&s;tiani ve|teres colligebant.</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>New-England</HI> had now, be&s;ides the <HI>Guardian-Angel,</HI> who more invi&s;ibly intended it's welfare, a <HI>Governour,</HI> that became wonderfully agreeable there|unto, by his whole Imitation of &s;uch a Guardian-Angel. He employed his whole Strength, to guard his People from all Di&s;a&s;ters, which threatned them either by Sea, or Land; and it was remark'd, that nothing remarkably Di&s;a&s;trous did befal that Peo|ple, from the Time of his Arrival to the Government, until there arrived an Order for his leaving it: (Except one Thing which was begun before he en|tred upon the Government:) But in&s;tead thereof, the <HI>Indians</HI> were notably defeated, in the A&s;&s;aults,
<PB N="66" REF="40">which they now made upon the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and &s;everal <HI>French</HI> Ships did al&s;o very advantageou&s;ly fall into his Hands; yea, there was by his means a Peace re|&s;tored unto the Province, that had been divers Years langui&s;hing under the Hectic Feaver of a Lingring War.</P>
<P>And there was this one thing more, that rende|red his Government the more de&s;irable; That where|as 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for a meer Man to govern without &s;ome <HI>Error,</HI> when ever, this Governour was advi&s;ed of any Error in any of his Admini&s;trations, he would immediately retract it, and revoke it, with all po&s;&s;ible ingenuity; &s;o that if any occa&s;ion of ju&s;t complaint aro&s;e, it was u&s;ually his endeavour, that it &s;hould not long be complain'd of

<P>But having in a <HI>Parenthe&s;is,</HI> newly intimated, that His Excellency, when he entred on his Government, found one Thing, that was <HI>remarkably Di&s;a&s;trous</HI> be|gun upon it: Of that one Thing, we will now give &s;ome Account.</P>

<P>ABOUT the Time of our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord's coming to Re&s;ide on Earth, we read of &s;o many <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with Devils,</HI> that it is commonly thought the <HI>Number</HI> of &s;uch Mi&s;e|rable <HI>Energumens</HI> was then encrea&s;ed above what has been u&s;ual in other Ages; and the <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> of that In|crea&s;e,
<PB N="67" REF="40">has been made a Matter of &s;ome Enquiry.

<P>It is very certain, there were hardly any People in the World grown more fond of <HI>Sorceries,</HI> than that unhappy People: The <HI>Talmuds</HI> tell us of the little <HI>Parchments</HI> with Words upon them, which were their common <HI>Amulets,</HI> and of the <HI>Charms</HI> which they mut|ter'd over <HI>Wounds,</HI> and of the various <HI>Enchantments</HI> which they u&s;ed again&s;t all &s;orts of Di&s;a&s;ters what&s;oe|ver. It is affirmed in the <HI>Talmuds,</HI> that no le&s;s than Twenty four Scholars in one School, were killed by <HI>Witchcraft;</HI> and that no le&s;s than <HI>four&s;core</HI> Per&s;ons were Hanged for <HI>Witchcraft</HI> by one Judge in one Day. The <HI>Glo&s;s</HI> adds upon it, <HI>That the Women of</HI> I&s;rael <HI>had gene|rally fallen to the Practice of Witchcrafts;</HI> and therefore it was required. That there &s;hould be &s;till cho&s;en into the Council, One &s;kilful in the <HI>Arts of Sorcerers,</HI> and able thereby to di&s;cover who might be guilty of tho&s;e <HI>Black Arts</HI> among &s;uch as were accu&s;ed before them.</P>
<P>Now the Arrival of Sir <HI>William Phips</HI> to the Govern|ment of <HI>New-England,</HI> was at a Time, when a Go|vernour would have had Occa&s;ion for all the Skill in <HI>Sorcerie,</HI> that was ever nece&s;&s;ary to a <HI>Jewi&s;h Councellor;</HI> A Time when Scores of poor people had newly fallen under, a prodigious <HI>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Devils,</HI> which it was then generally thought had been by <HI>Witchcrafts</HI> intro|duced.
<PB N="68" REF="41">It is to be confe&s;&s;ed and Bewailed, That many Inhabitants of <HI>New-England,</HI> and Young people e&s;pecial|ly, had been Led away with Little <HI>Sorceries,</HI> wherein they <HI>did Secretly tho&s;e Things that were not Right again&s;t the Lord their God;</HI> They would often cure Hurts with <HI>Spells,</HI> and practi&s;e dete&s;table Conjurations with <HI>Sieves,</HI> and <HI>Keys,</HI> and <HI>Pea&s;e,</HI> and <HI>Nails</HI> and <HI>Hor&s;e|&s;hoes,</HI> and other Implements, to Learn the Things, for which they had a forbidden and impious Curio|&s;ity. Wretched Books had &s;toln into the Land, where|in Fools were in&s;tructed, how to become able For|tune-Tellers: Among which, I wonder that a blacker Brand is not &s;et upon that Fortune-telling Wheel, which that Sham-Scribler, that goes under the Let|ters of <HI>R. B.</HI> has propo&s;ed in his <HI>Delights for the In|genious,</HI> as an <HI>hone&s;t and plea&s;ant Recreation:</HI> And by the&s;e Books, the minds of many had been &s;o poi&s;o|ned, that they &s;tudied this <HI>Finer Witchcraft;</HI> until, 'tis well, if &s;ome of them were not betray'd, into what is gro&s;&s;er, and more &s;en&s;ible and Capital. Al|though the&s;e <HI>Diabolical Divinations</HI> are more ordina|rily committed perhaps all over the <HI>whole World,</HI> than they are in the Country of <HI>New-England,</HI> yet, That being a Country Devoted unto the Wor&s;hip and Service of the Lord <HI>JES&V;S CHRIST</HI> above the <HI>Re&s;t of the World. He</HI> &s;ignalized his Vengeance again&s;t the&s;e wickedne&s;&s;es, with &s;uch extraordinary Di&s;pen&s;ations, as have not been often &s;een in others Places.</P>
<P>The <HI>Devils,</HI> which had been &s;o play'd withal, and, it may be, by &s;ome few Criminals more Expli|citely engaged and imployed, now broke in upon the Country, after as aftoni&s;hing a manner, as was ever heard of. Some &s;cores of People, fir&s;t about <HI>Salem,</HI> the Centre and fir&s;t Born, of all the Towns in the Colony, and afterwards in &s;everal other Places, were arre&s;ted with many <HI>Praternatural Vexations</HI> upon their Bodies, and a variety of cruel Torments, which were
<PB N="69" REF="41">evidently inflicted from the <HI>Daemons</HI> of the <HI>Invi&s;ible World.</HI> The People that were <HI>infected</HI> and <HI>infe&s;ted</HI> with &s;uch <HI>Daemons,</HI> in a few Days Time, arrived unto &s;uch a <HI>Re&s;ining Alteration</HI> upon their Eyes, that they could &s;ee their Tormentors; they &s;aw a <HI>Devil</HI> of a little <HI>Stature,</HI> and of a Tawny <HI>Colour,</HI> attended &s;till with <HI>Spectres,</HI> that appeared in more Humane Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Tormentors,</HI> tendred unto the Afflicted, a <HI>Book,</HI> requiring them to <HI>Sign</HI> it, or to <HI>Touch</HI> it, at lea&s;t, in token of their con&s;enting to be Li&s;ted in the Service of the <HI>Devil;</HI> which, they refu&s;ing to do, the <HI>Spectres</HI> under the command of that <HI>Black|man,</HI> as they called him, would apply them&s;elves to Torture them, with prodigious Mole&s;tations.</P>
<P>The afflicted Wretches were horribly <HI>Di&s;torted</HI> and <HI>Convul&s;ed;</HI> they were <HI>Pinched</HI> Black and Blew; <HI>Pins</HI> would be run every where in their Fle&s;h; they would be <HI>&s;calded</HI> until they had <HI>Bli&s;ters</HI> rai&s;ed on them; and a thou&s;and other things before Hundreds of Witne&s;&s;es were done unto them, evidently <HI>Prae|ternatural:</HI> For, if it were <HI>Praeternatural,</HI> to keep a rigid <HI>Fa&s;t,</HI> for <HI>Nine,</HI> yea, for <HI>Fifteen</HI> Days together; or, if it were <HI>Praeternatural,</HI> to have ones Hands <HI>ty'd</HI> clo&s;e together, with a <HI>Rope</HI> to be plainly &s;een, and then by <HI>un&s;een Hands</HI> pre&s;ently pull'd up a great way from the Earth, before a croud of People: Such <HI>Praeternatural</HI> Things were endured by them.</P>
<P>But of all the <HI>Praeternatural</HI> Things which befel the&s;e People, there were none more <HI>unaccountable</HI> than tho&s;e, wherein the prae&s;tigious <HI>Daemons</HI> would ever now and then cover the mo&s;t <HI>Corporeal</HI> Things in the World, with a <HI>Fa&s;cinating Mi&s;t</HI> of <HI>Invi&s;ibility.</HI> As now; A Per&s;on was cruelly a&s;&s;aulted by a <HI>Spectre,</HI> that, &s;he &s;aid, run at her with a <HI>Spindle,</HI> though no Body el&s;e in the Room could &s;ee either the <HI>Spectre</HI> or the <HI>Spindle:</HI> At la&s;t in her Agonies, giving a &s;natch at the <HI>Spectre,</HI> &s;he pulled the <HI>Spindle</HI> away;
<PB N="70" REF="42">and it was no &s;ooner got into her Hand, but the other Folks then pre&s;ent, beheld that it was indeed a real, proper, Iron <HI>Spindle;</HI> which when they lock|ed up very &s;afe, it was neverthele&s;s by the <HI>Daemons</HI> taken away to do farther Mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>Again; A Per&s;on was haunted by a mo&s;t abu&s;ive <HI>Spectre,</HI> which came to her, &s;he &s;aid, with a <HI>Sheet</HI> about her, though &s;een to none but her &s;elf.

There wanted not the <HI>Oaths</HI> of good credible Peo|ple, to the&s;e particulars.</P>
<P>Al&s;o, It is well known, that the&s;e wicked <HI>Spectres</HI> did proceed &s;o far as to &s;teal &s;everal Quantities of Money from divers People, part of which Individual Money, was dropt &s;ometimes out of the Air, before &s;ufficient <HI>Spectators,</HI> into the Hands of the Afflicted, while the <HI>Spectres</HI> were urging them to &s;ub&s;cribe their <HI>Covenant with Death.</HI> Moreover, <HI>Poi&s;ons</HI> to the &s;tanders-by, wholly <HI>Invi&s;ible,</HI> were &s;ometimes forced upon the Afflicted; which when they have with much Reluctancy &s;wallowed, they have <HI>&s;woln</HI> pre&s;ent|ly, &s;o that the common Medicines for <HI>Poi&s;ons</HI> have been found nece&s;&s;ary to relieve them: Yea, &s;ome|times the <HI>Spectres</HI> in the <HI>&s;truggles,</HI> have &s;o dropt the <HI>Poi&s;ons,</HI> that the Standers by have &s;melt them, and view'd them, and beheld the <HI>Pillows</HI> of the mi&s;era|ble &s;tained with them.</P>
<PB N="71" REF="42">
<P>Yet more, the mi&s;erable have complained bitterly of <HI>burning Rags</HI> run into their forceably di&s;tended <HI>Mouths,</HI> and though no Body could &s;ee any &s;uch <HI>Clothes,</HI> or, indeed any <HI>Fires</HI> in the Chambers, yet pre&s;ently the <HI>&s;calds</HI> were &s;een plainly, by every Bo|dy, on the Mouths of the Complainers, and not on|ly the <HI>Smell,</HI> but the <HI>Smoke</HI> of the Burning, &s;en&s;ibly fill'd the Chambers.</P>
<P>Once more; the mi&s;erable exclaimed extreamly of <HI>Branding Irons</HI> heating at the Fire, on the Hearth, to mark them; now though the &s;tanders-by could &s;ee no <HI>Irons,</HI> yet they could &s;ee di&s;tinctly the Print of them in the A&s;hes, and <HI>&s;mell</HI> them too as they were carried by the <HI>not-&s;een Furies,</HI> unto the Poor Creatures for whom they were intended; and tho&s;e Poor Creatures were thereupon &s;o <HI>&s;tigmatized</HI> with them, that they will bear the <HI>Marks</HI> of them to their Dying Day.

The Exi&s;tence of &s;uch <HI>Witches,</HI> was now taken for granted by tho&s;e good Men, wherein &s;o far the generality of rea&s;onable Men have
<PB N="73" REF="43">thought, <HI>they ran well;</HI> and they &s;oon received the <HI>Con|fe&s;&s;ions</HI> of &s;ome <HI>accu&s;ed</HI> Per&s;ons to confirm them in it; but then, they took one thing more for granted, wherein 'tis now as generally thought they <HI>went out of the Way.</HI> The Afflicted People vehemently accu|&s;ed &s;everal Per&s;ons in &s;everal Places, that the <HI>Spectres</HI> which afflicted them, did exactly re&s;emble <HI>Them;</HI> un|til the importunity of the Accu&s;ations did provoke the Magi&s;trates to examine them. When many of the <HI>accu&s;ed</HI> came upon their Examination, it was found, that the <HI>Daemons,</HI> then a thou&s;and ways abu|&s;ing of the poor <HI>afflicted</HI> People, had with a marvel|lous exactne&s;s <HI>repre&s;ented</HI> them; yea it was found that many of the <HI>accu&s;ed,</HI> but ca&s;ting their Eye on the <HI>af|flicted,</HI> the <HI>afflicted,</HI> though their Faces were never &s;o much another way, would fall down and lye in a &s;ort of a &s;woon, wherein they would continue, what|ever Hands were laid upon them, until the Hands of the <HI>accu&s;ed</HI> came to touch them, and <HI>then</HI> they would revive immediately: And it was found, that variou|kinds of <HI>natural Actions</HI> done by many of the <HI>accu&s;ed</HI> in or to their own Bodies, as <HI>Leaning, Bending, Turn|ing</HI> Awry, or <HI>Squeezing</HI> their Hands or the like, were pre&s;ently attended with the like things <HI>praeternaturally</HI> done upon the Bodies of the <HI>Afflicted,</HI> though they were &s;o far a&s;under that the <HI>Afflicted</HI> could not at all ob&s;erve the <HI>Accu&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P>It was al&s;o found that the Fle&s;h of the Afflicted was often <HI>Bitten,</HI> at &s;uch a rate, that not only the <HI>Print of Teeth</HI> would be left on their <HI>Fle&s;h,</HI> but the very <HI>Slaver</HI> of Spittle too: And there would appear ju&s;t &s;uch a <HI>&s;et of Teeth,</HI> as was in the <HI>Accu&s;ed,</HI> even &s;uch as might be clearly di&s;tingui&s;hed from other Peoples.

<PB N="74" REF="44">
<P>Now many good Men took up an Opinion, That the <HI>Providence</HI> of God would not permit an <HI>Innocent Per&s;on</HI> to come under &s;uch a <HI>Spectral Repre&s;entation;</HI> and that a concurrence of &s;o many Circum&s;tances, would prove an <HI>Accu&s;ed</HI> Per&s;on to be in a <HI>Confederacy</HI> with the <HI>Daemons</HI> thus afflicting of the Neighbours; they judged, that except the&s;e Things might amount unto a <HI>Conviction,</HI> it would &s;carce be po&s;&s;ible ever to <HI>Convict</HI> a <HI>Witch;</HI> and they had &s;ome <HI>Philo&s;ophical Schemes</HI> of <HI>Witcheraft,</HI> and or the Method and Manner, wherein <HI>Magical Poi&s;ons</HI> operate, which further &s;up|ported them in their Opinion.</P>
<P>Sundry of the <HI>Accu&s;ed</HI> Per&s;ons were brought unto their <HI>Trial,</HI> while this Opinion was yet prevailing in the Minds of the <HI>Judges,</HI> and the <HI>Juries,</HI> and perhaps the mo&s;t of the People in the County, then mo&s;tly Suffering; and though again&s;t &s;ome of them that were Tried, there came in &s;o much <HI>other Evidence</HI> of their Diabolical Compacts, that &s;ome of the mo&s;t <HI>Judici|ous</HI> and yet <HI>vehement</HI> Oppo&s;ers of the Notions then in Vogue, publickly declared, <HI>Had they them&s;elves been on the Bench, they could not have Acquitted them;</HI> ne|verthele&s;s, divers were Condemned, again&s;t whom the <HI>chief Evidence</HI> was founded in the <HI>Spectral Exhibitions.</HI></P>
<P>And it happening, that &s;ome of the <HI>Accu&s;ed</HI> coming to confe&s;s them&s;elves <HI>Guilty,</HI> their <HI>Shapes</HI> were no more &s;een by any of the <HI>Afflicted,</HI> though the Confe&s;&s;ion had been kept never &s;o Secret, but in&s;tead thereof the <HI>Ac|cu&s;ed</HI> them&s;elves became in all Vexations ju&s;t like the <HI>Afflicted;</HI> this yet more confirmed many in the Opinion, that had been taken up.</P>
<P>And another thing that quickned them yet more to Act upon it, was, That the Afflicted were frequent|ly entertained with <HI>Apparitions</HI> of <HI>Cho&s;ts</HI> at the &s;ame Time, that the <HI>Spectres</HI> of the &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>Witches</HI> trou|bled them: Which <HI>Chri&s;ts</HI> always ca&s;t the Beholders into far more Con&s;ternation than any of the <HI>Spectres;</HI> and when they exhibited them&s;elves, they cryed out

<P>The <HI>Afflicted</HI> People, many times, had never heard any thing before of the Per&s;ons appearing in <HI>Gho&s;t,</HI> or of the Per&s;ons <HI>Accu&s;ed</HI> by the <HI>Apparitions;</HI> and yet the Accu&s;ed upon Examination have confe&s;&s;ed the Murders of tho&s;e very Per&s;ons, though the&s;e <HI>Accu&s;ed</HI> al&s;o knew nothing of the <HI>Apparitions,</HI> that had come in again&s;t them; and the <HI>Afflicted</HI> Per&s;ons likewi&s;e without any private Agreement or Collution, when &s;ucce&s;&s;ively brought into a Room, have all a&s;&s;erted the &s;ame <HI>Apparations</HI> to be there before them: The&s;e <HI>Mur|ders</HI> did &s;eem to call for an Enquiry.</P>

<P>AS one of the fir&s;t Actions <HI>done</HI> by Sir <HI>William,</HI> af|ter he came to the Age of <HI>Doing,</HI> was to &s;ave the Lives of many poor People from the Rage of the <HI>Di|abolical Indians</HI> in the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> Parts of the Country, &s;o now he was come to the Government, his Mind was very vehemently &s;et upon recovering of tho&s;e Parts, from the Mi&s;eries, which a New and a Long War of the <HI>Indians</HI> had brought upon them. His <HI>Birth</HI> and <HI>Youth,</HI> in the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> had rendred him well known unto the <HI>In|dians</HI> there; he had Hunted, and Fi&s;hed many a wea|ry Day, in his Childhood with them; and when tho&s;e rude Savages had got the Story by the End, that <HI>he had found a Ship full of Money, and was know become all-one-a-King!</HI> They were mightily a&s;toni&s;hed at it: But when they farther under&s;tood that he was become the Governour of <HI>New-England,</HI> it added a further De|gree of Con&s;ternation to their A&s;toni&s;hment. He likewi&s;e was better acquainted with the Scituation of tho&s;e Regions, than mo&s;t other Men; and he con&s;i|der'd what va&s;t Advantages might ari&s;e, to no le&s;s, than the whole <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, from the <HI>Lumber,</HI> and <HI>Fi&s;hery</HI> and <HI>Naval-&s;tores,</HI> which tho&s;e Regions might &s;oon &s;upply the whole Nation withal, if once they were well &s;ettled with good Inhabitants.</P>
<P>Wherefore Governour <HI>Phips,</HI> took the fir&s;t Oppor|tunity, to rai&s;e an Army, with which he Travelled in Per&s;on, unto the <HI>Ea&s;t-Country</HI> to find out and cut off the Barbarous Enemy, which had continued for near four Years together, making horrible Havock on the
<PB N="83" REF="48">Plantations, that lay all along the Northern <HI>Frontiers</HI> of <HI>New-England:</HI> And having pur&s;ued tho&s;e wor&s;e than <HI>Scythian Wolves,</HI> till they could be no longer fol|lowed, he did, with a very laudable <HI>Skill,</HI> and unu&s;ual <HI>Speed,</HI> and with le&s;s <HI>Co&s;t</HI> unto the Crown, than per|haps ever &s;uch a Thing was done in the World, erect a &s;trong <HI>Fort,</HI> at <HI>Pemmaquid,</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Fort,</HI> he contrived &s;o much in the very Heart of the Country now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Enemy, as very much to hinder the &s;everal Nations of the Tawnies from <HI>Clanning</HI> together, for the common Di&s;turbance; and his De&s;ign was, that a &s;ufficient Garri&s;on being here po&s;ted, they might from thence, upon Advice, i&s;&s;ue forth to &s;urprize that ferocient Enemy. At the &s;ame time he would fain have gone in Per&s;on up the Bay of <HI>Funda,</HI> with a convenient <HI>Force,</HI> to have &s;poiled a Nea&s;t of Rebellious <HI>Frenchmen,</HI> who being Rendez|vouzed at St. <HI>John</HI>'s, had a yearly Supply of Aminu|nition from <HI>France,</HI> with which they &s;till &s;upplied the <HI>Indians,</HI> unto the extream Detriment of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> but his Friends for a long time, would not permit him to expo&s;e him&s;elf unto the Inconveniencies of that Expedition.</P>
<P>However, he took &s;uch Methods, that the <HI>Indian Kings of the</HI> Ea&s;t, within a little while, had their Stomachs brought down, to &s;ue and beg for a <HI>Peace;</HI> And making their Appearance at the New-Fort, in <HI>Pemmaquid,</HI> Aug. 11. 1693. They did there Sign an In&s;trument, wherein, lamenting the Mi&s;eries which their Adherence to the <HI>French Coun&s;els,</HI> had brought them into, they did for them&s;elves and with the Con|&s;ent of all the <HI>Indians</HI> from the River of <HI>Merrimack,</HI> to the mo&s;t Ea&s;terly Bounds of all the Province, ac|knowledge their Hearty Subjection and Obedience un|to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> and &s;olemnly Covenant, Promi&s;e, and Agree, to and with Sir <HI>William Phips,</HI> Captain General and Governour in Chief over the Province, and his Succe&s;&s;ors in that Place, <HI>That</HI> they
<PB N="84" REF="49">would for ever cea&s;e all Acts of Ho&s;tility towards the Subjects of the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> and hold a Con&s;tant Friend&s;hip with all the <HI>Engli&s;h. That</HI> they would ut|terly abandon the <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;ts, and not &s;uccour or conceal any Enemy <HI>Indians,</HI> from <HI>Canada</HI> or el&s;ewhere, that &s;hould come to any of their Plantations within the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Territories: <HI>That</HI> all <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Captives, which they had among them, &s;hould be returned with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed, and no Ran&s;om or Payment be giv|en for any of them; <HI>That</HI> their Maje&s;ties Subjects the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> now &s;hould quietly enter upon, and for ever improve and enjoy all and &s;ingular their Rights of Lands, and former Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, within the Ea&s;tern Parts of the Province, without any claims from any <HI>Indians,</HI> or being ever di&s;turbed therein: <HI>That</HI> all Trade and Commerce, which hereafter might be allowed between the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;hould be under a Regulation &s;tated by an Act of the <HI>General A&s;&s;embly,</HI> or as limitted by the Governour of the Province, with the Con&s;ent and Advice of his Council. And <HI>That,</HI> if any Controver&s;ie hereafter happen between any of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and the <HI>Indians,</HI> no Private Revenge was to be taken by the <HI>Indians,</HI> but proper Applica|tions to be made unto His Maje&s;ties Government, for the due Remedy thereof: <HI>Submitting them&s;elves here|withal to be Governed by His Maje&s;ty's Laws.</HI></P>
<P>And for the Manife&s;tation of their <HI>Sincerity</HI> in the <HI>Submi&s;&s;ion</HI> thus made, the <HI>Hypocritical Wretches</HI> deli|vered <HI>Ho&s;tages</HI> for their Fidelity; and then &s;et their <HI>Marks</HI> and <HI>Seals,</HI> no le&s;s than thirteen <HI>Sagamores</HI> of them, (with <HI>Names</HI> of more than a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> length) unto this In&s;trument.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Ri&s;e of this <HI>Indian War,</HI> had hitherto been almo&s;t as Dark as that of the River <HI>Nilus:</HI> 'Tis true, if any <HI>Wild Engli&s;h</HI> did ra&s;hly begin to provoke and affront the <HI>Indians,</HI> yet the <HI>Indians</HI> had a fairer way to obtain Ju&s;tice, than by Blood&s;hed: However, up|on the <HI>New-Engli&s;h Revolution,</HI> the State of the <HI>War</HI>
<PB N="85" REF="49">became wholly <HI>New:</HI> The Government then employ|ed all po&s;&s;ible ways to procure a good Under&s;tanding with the <HI>Indians,</HI> but all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Offers, Kindne&s;&s;es, Courte&s;ies were barbarou&s;ly requited by them, with New Acts of the mo&s;t perfidious Ho&s;tility. Notwith|&s;tanding all this, there were &s;till &s;ome <HI>Nice People,</HI> that had their &s;cruples about the <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> of the <HI>War;</HI> but upon this New Submi&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Indians,</HI> if ever tho&s;e <HI>Rattle-&s;nakes</HI> (the only <HI>Rattle-&s;nakes,</HI> which, they &s;ay, were ever &s;een to the Northward of <HI>Merimack-River</HI>) &s;hould &s;tir again, the mo&s;t &s;crupulous Per&s;ons in the World mu&s;t own, <HI>That it mu&s;t be the mo&s;t unexceptiona|ble piece of Ju&s;tice in the World for to extingui&s;h them.</HI></P>
<P>Thus did the God of Heaven ble&s;s the unwearied Applications of Sir <HI>William Phips,</HI> for the re&s;toring of <HI>Peace</HI> unto <HI>New-England,</HI> when the Country was quite <HI>out of Breath,</HI> in its Endeavours for its own Pre&s;erva|tion, from the continual out-rages of an inacce&s;&s;ible E|nemy, and by the <HI>Poverty coming in, &s;o like an armed Man</HI> from the un&s;ucce&s;sfulne&s;s of their former <HI>Armies,</HI> that it could not imagine, how to take one &s;tep fur|ther in it's Wars. The mo&s;t Happy Re&s;pite of <HI>Peace</HI> beyond <HI>Merimack-River</HI> being thus procured, the Go|vernour immediately &s;et him&s;elf to u&s;e all po&s;&s;ible Me|thods, that it might be <HI>Peace, like a River,</HI> nothing &s;hort of <HI>Everla&s;ting.</HI></P>
<P>He therefore prevailed with Two or Three Gentle|men to join with him, in &s;ending a Supply of <HI>Nece&s;|&s;aries for Life,</HI> unto the <HI>Indians,</HI> until the General A&s;&s;embly could come together to &s;ettle the <HI>Indian-Trade</HI> for the Advantage of the Publick, that the <HI>In|dians</HI> might not by Nece&s;&s;ity be driven again, to be|come a <HI>French</HI> Propriety; although by this Action, as the Gentlemen them&s;elves were great <HI>Lo&s;ers</HI> in their E&s;tates, thus <HI>He</HI> Him&s;elf declared unto the Mem|bers of the General A&s;&s;embly, that he would upon Oath, give an Account unto them of all his own Gains, and count him&s;elf a Gainer, if in lieu of all, they would
<PB N="86" REF="50">give him <HI>one Beaver-Hat.</HI> The &s;ame Genero&s;ity al&s;o cau&s;ed him to take many a tedious Voyage, accom|panied &s;ometimes with his <HI>Fidus Achates</HI> and very Dear Friend, Kin&s;man and Neighbour, Colonel <HI>John Philips,</HI> between <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> and <HI>Pemmaquid;</HI> and this in the bitter Weeks of the <HI>New-Engli&s;h,</HI> which is almo&s;t a <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Winter.</P>
<P>He was a &s;ort of <HI>Confe&s;&s;or</HI> under &s;uch Torments of <HI>Cold,</HI> as once made the <HI>Martyrdom</HI> of <HI>Muria,</HI> and o|thers commemorated in Orations of the Ancients; and the <HI>Snow</HI> and <HI>Ice</HI> which <HI>Pliny</HI> calls, <HI>The Puni&s;h|ment of Mountains,</HI> he chearfully endured, without any other <HI>Profit</HI> unto him&s;elf, but only the <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI> of thereby e&s;tabli&s;hing and centinuing unto the People the Liberty to <HI>Sleep</HI> quietly in their <HI>warm Ne&s;ts</HI> at home, while he was thus concerned for them abroad. <HI>Non mihi &s;ed Populo,</HI> the Motto of the Emperour <HI>Ha|drian,</HI> was engraved on the Heart of Sir <HI>William:</HI> NOT FOR MY SELF, BUT FOR MY PEOPLE: Or that of <HI>Maximin, Quo major, hoc Laborio&s;ior,</HI> the more Honourable, the more Laborious.</P>
<P>Indeed the <HI>Re&s;tle&s;ne&s;s</HI> of his Travels to the <HI>Southern</HI> as well as the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> Parts of the Country, when the Publick Safety call'd for his Pre&s;ence, would have made one to think on the Tran&s;lation which the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> on a very extraordinary occa&s;ion, gave the Fourth Ver&s;e in the Hundred and Twenty fir&s;t <HI>P&s;alm. He will not &s;lumber, nor will he &s;uffer to &s;leep, the Keep|er of</HI> I&s;rael. Nor did he only try to <HI>Cicurate</HI> the <HI>Indians</HI> of the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> by other Prudent and Proper Treatments, but he al&s;o furni&s;hed him&s;elf with an <HI>In|dian</HI> Preacher of the Go&s;pel, whom he carried unto the <HI>Ea&s;tward,</HI> with an Intention to teach them the Principles of the <HI>Prote&s;tant Religion,</HI> and unteach them the mixt <HI>Paganry</HI> and <HI>Popery</HI> which hitherto <HI>Diabo|liz'd</HI> them. To <HI>unteach</HI> them, I &s;ay; for they had been <HI>Taught</HI> by the <HI>French</HI> Prie&s;ts <HI>this</HI> among other things, That the Mother of our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour was
<PB N="87" REF="50">a <HI>French Lady,</HI> and that they were <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> by whom our Saviour was murdered; and that it was therefore a <HI>meritorious</HI> Thing to de&s;troy the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation. The Name of the Preacher whom the Governour carried with him, was <HI>Nahauton,</HI> one of the Natives; and becau&s;e the pa&s;&s;ing of &s;uch Expre&s;&s;ions from the Mouth of a Poor <HI>Indian</HI> may upon &s;ome Accounts be worthy of <HI>Remembrance,</HI> let it be <HI>Remembred,</HI> that when the Governour propounded unto him &s;uch a <HI>Mi&s;&s;ion</HI> to the <HI>Ea&s;tern Indians,</HI> he replied, <HI>I know that I &s;hall probably Endanger my Life by going to Preach the Go&s;pel among the Frenchified</HI> Indians, <HI>but I know that it will be a Service unto the Lord Je&s;us Christ; and therefore I will venture to go.</HI></P>
<P>God grant that his <HI>Behaviours</HI> may be in all things, at all times, according to the&s;e his <HI>Expre&s;&s;ions!</HI> While the&s;e things were doing, having Intelligence of a <HI>French</HI> Man of War, expected at St. <HI>John's,</HI> he Di&s;|patched away the <HI>Non-&s;uch-Frigat</HI> thither to intercept him; neverthele&s;s by the gro&s;s <HI>Negligence</HI> and per|haps <HI>Cowardi&s;e</HI> of the Captain, who had lately come from <HI>England,</HI> with Orders to take the Command of her, in&s;tead of one, who had been by Sir <HI>William</HI> a while before put in, and one who had &s;ignalized him|&s;elf by doing of notable Service for the King and Country in it, the <HI>Frenchman</HI> arrived, unladed, and went away untouch'd.

<P>But while the <HI>Genero&s;ity</HI> of Sir <HI>William,</HI> cau&s;ed him to de&s;ire a <HI>Liberty of Con&s;cience,</HI> his <HI>Piety</HI> would not allow a <HI>Liberty of Prophanene&s;s,</HI> either to him&s;elf or others.

<P>Neverthele&s;s, he did &s;how a Con&s;cientious De&s;ire to ob&s;erve the Laws of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t in his <HI>Conver&s;ation;</HI> and he con&s;cientiou&s;ly attended upon the Exerci&s;es of <HI>Devotion</HI> in the Sea&s;ons thereof, on <HI>Lectures,</HI> as well as on <HI>Lords-Days,</HI> and in the <HI>Daily-Sacrifice,</HI> the Morning and Evening Service of his own Family; yea, and at the <HI>Private Meetings</HI> of the De|vout People kept every <HI>Formight</HI> in the Neighbour|hood.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides all this, when he had <HI>great Works</HI> before him, he would Invite good Men to come and <HI>Fa&s;t</HI> and <HI>Pray</HI> with him at his Hou&s;e for the Succe&s;s there|of; and when he had &s;ucceeded in what he had un|dertaken, he would prevail with them to come and keep a Day of Solemn <HI>Thanksgiving</HI> with him. His <HI>Love</HI> to Almighty <HI>God,</HI> was indeed, manife&s;ted by nothing more, than his <HI>Love</HI> to tho&s;e that had the <HI>Image</HI> of God, upon them; He Heartily, and with a Real <HI>Honour</HI> for them, <HI>Loved</HI> all <HI>Godly Men;</HI> and in &s;o doing, he did not confine <HI>Godline&s;s</HI> to this or that Party, but wherever he &s;aw the <HI>Fear of God,</HI> in one of a <HI>Congregational,</HI> or <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> or <HI>Antipaedobap|tist,</HI> or <HI>Epi&s;copalian</HI> Per&s;wa&s;ion, he did, without any Difference, expre&s;s towards them a Reverent Affe|ction.</P>
<PB N="93" REF="54">
<P>But he made no Men more welcome, than tho&s;e <HI>Good Men,</HI> who&s;e <HI>Office</HI> 'tis to promote and pre&s;erve <HI>Goodne&s;s</HI> in all other Men; even the <HI>Ministers</HI> of the Go&s;pel: E&s;pecially when they were &s;uch as faithfully Di&s;charged their Office: And from the&s;e at any Time, the lea&s;t Admonition or Intimation of any good Thing to be done by him, he entertain|ed with a mo&s;t obliging Alacrity. His <HI>Religion</HI> in Truth, was one Principle that added <HI>Virtue</HI> unto that va&s;t <HI>Courage,</HI> which was always in him to a De|gree <HI>Heroical.</HI> Tho&s;e Terrible Nations, which made their De&s;cents from the <HI>Northern</HI> on the <HI>Southern</HI> Parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> in tho&s;e Elder Ages, when &s;o to <HI>&s;warm out</HI> was more frequent with them, were in|&s;pired with a <HI>valiant Contempt of Life,</HI> by the Opi|nion, wherein their famous <HI>Odin</HI> in&s;tructed them. <HI>That their Death was but an Entrance into another Life, wherein they who Died in Warlike Actions, were bravely feasted with the God of War for ever:</HI> 'Tis inexpre&s;&s;ible, How much the <HI>Courage</HI> of tho&s;e fierce Mortals was fortified by that Opinion.</P>
<P>But when Sir <HI>William Phips</HI> was asked by &s;ome that ob&s;erved his <HI>Valiant Contempt of Death,</HI> What it was that made him &s;o little afraid of <HI>Dying,</HI> he gave a better grounded Account of it, than tho&s;e <HI>Pagans</HI> could; his An&s;wer was, <HI>I do humbly believe, That the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;hed his Precious Blood for me, by His Death procuring my Peace with God: and what &s;hould I now be afraid of Dying for?</HI></P>
<P>But this Leads me to mention the <HI>Humble</HI> and <HI>Mode&s;t</HI> Carriage in him, towards other <HI>Men,</HI> which accompanied this his <HI>Piety.</HI> There were certain <HI>Pomps</HI> belonging unto the &s;everal <HI>Places of Honour,</HI> through which he pa&s;&s;ed; <HI>Pomps,</HI> that are very taking to Men of <HI>little Souls:</HI> But although he ro&s;e from &s;o <HI>little,</HI> yet he di&s;covered a marvellous <HI>Contempt</HI> of tho&s;e Aie|ry Things, and as far, as he hand&s;omely could, he declined being ceremoniou&s;ly, or any otherwi&s;e than
<PB N="94" REF="55">with a <HI>Dutch Mode&s;ty</HI> waited upon. And it might more truly be &s;aid of him, than it was of <HI>Ari&s;tides, He was never &s;een the Prouder for any Honour, that was done him from his Country-men.</HI></P>
<P>Hence, albeit I have read that complaint, made by a worthy Man, <HI>I have often ob&s;erved, and this not without &s;ome Blu&s;hing, that even good People have had a kind of &s;hame upon them, to acknowledge their low be|ginning, and u&s;ed all Arts to hide it.</HI> I could never <HI>ob&s;erve</HI> the lea&s;t of that Fault in this worthy Man; but he would &s;peak of his own <HI>low beginning</HI> with as much Freedom and Frequency, as if he had been afraid of having it forgotten.</P>
<P>It was counted an Humility in King <HI>Agathocles,</HI> the Son of a <HI>Potter,</HI> to be &s;erved therefore in <HI>Earth|en Ve&s;&s;els,</HI> as <HI>Plutarch</HI> hath informed us: It was counted an Humility in Arch-Bi&s;hop <HI>Willigis,</HI> the Son of a <HI>Wheel-wright,</HI> therefore to have <HI>Wheels</HI> hung a|bout his Bed-Chamber, with this In&s;cription, <HI>Recole und&egrave; Veneris,</HI> i. e. <HI>Remember thy Original.</HI> But &s;uch was the <HI>Humility</HI> and <HI>Lowline&s;s</HI> of this <HI>Ri&s;ing Man!</HI> Not only did he after his return to his Country in his Greatne&s;s, one Day, make a &s;plendid Fea&s;t for the <HI>Ship Carpenters</HI> of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> among whom he was willing at his Table, to Commemorate, the Mercy of God unto him, who had once been a <HI>Ship Car|penter</HI> him&s;elf, but he would on all occa&s;ions <HI>permit,</HI> yea, <HI>Study</HI> to have his <HI>Meanne&s;&s;es</HI> remembred.</P>
<P>Hence upon frequent occa&s;ions of Unea&s;ine&s;s in his Government, he would chu&s;e thus to expre&s;s him|&s;elf, <HI>Gentlemen, were it not that I am to do Service for the Publick, I &s;hould be much ea&s;ier in returning un|to my Broad Ax again!</HI> And hence, according to the <HI>Affable</HI> Courte&s;ie, which he ordinarily u&s;ed unto all &s;orts of Per&s;ons (quite contrary to the <HI>A&s;perity,</HI> which the old Proverb, expects in the <HI>Rai&s;ed</HI>) he would particularly, when Sailing in &s;ight of <HI>Kenne|beck,</HI> with Armies under his Command, call the

<P>In fine, our Sir <HI>William</HI> was a Per&s;on of &s;o &s;weet a Temper, that they who were mo&s;t intimately ac|quainted with him, would commonly pronounce him, <HI>The best Conditioned Gentleman in the World!</HI> And by the continual Di&s;coveries and Expre&s;&s;ions of &s;uch a <HI>Temper;</HI> he &s;o gained the Hearts of them who waited upon him in any of his Expeditions, that they would commonly profe&s;s them&s;elves willing &s;till, <HI>to have gone with him to the End of the World.</HI></P>
<P>But if all other People found him &s;o kind a <HI>Neighbour,</HI> we may ea&s;ily inferr what an Hu&s;band he was unto his <HI>Lady.</HI> Leaving unmentioned that <HI>Vir|tue</HI> of his <HI>Chastity,</HI> which the Prodigious Depravati|on, brought by the Late Reigns upon the Manners of the Nation, has made worthy to be mentioned as a <HI>Virtue</HI> &s;omewhat <HI>Extraordinary;</HI> I &s;hall rather pa&s;s on to &s;ay, That the <HI>Love,</HI> even to <HI>Fondne&s;s,</HI> with which he always treated her, was a Matter not on|ly of <HI>Ob&s;ervation,</HI> but even of &s;uch <HI>Admiration,</HI> that every one &s;aid, <HI>The Age afforded not a kinder Hu&s;|band!</HI> This Kindne&s;s appeared not only in his ma|king it no le&s;s his <HI>Delight</HI> than <HI>Study,</HI> to render his
<PB N="96" REF="56">whole Conver&s;ation agreeable to her, but al&s;o, and perhaps chiefly, in the <HI>Satisfaction</HI> which it gave him, to have his Intere&s;ts very much at her Com|mand.

<P>In the mean Time, I cannot but relate a wonder|ful Experience of Sir <HI>William Phips,</HI> by the Relation whereof &s;omething of an <HI>Antidote</HI> may be given a|gain&s;t a <HI>Poi&s;on,</HI> which the Diabolical <HI>Figure-Flirgers,</HI> and <HI>Fortune-Tellers</HI> that &s;warm all the World over, may in&s;inuate into the Minds of Men. Long before Mr. <HI>Phips</HI> came to be Sir <HI>William,</HI> while he &s;ojourn|ed in <HI>London,</HI> there came into his Lodging an Old <HI>A&s;trologer,</HI> living in the Neighbourhood, who making &s;ome <HI>Ob&s;ervation</HI> of him, though he had &s;mall or no <HI>Conver&s;ation</HI> with him, did (howbeit by him wholly unde&s;ired) one Day &s;end him a Paper, where|in he had, with Pretences of a Rule in <HI>A&s;trology</HI> for each Article, di&s;tinctly noted the mo&s;t material Pa&s;&s;ages that were to befall this our <HI>Phips,</HI> in the remaining Part of his Life; it was particularly A&s;|&s;erted and In&s;erted, That he &s;hould be engaged in a De&s;ign, wherein by Rea&s;on of Enemies at <HI>Court,</HI> he &s;hould meet with much Delay; That neverthe|le&s;s in the <HI>Thirty Seventh</HI> Year of his Life, he &s;hould find a <HI>mighty Trea&s;ure;</HI> That in the <HI>Forty Fir&s;t</HI> Year of his Life, his <HI>King</HI> &s;hould employ him, in as great a <HI>Tru&s;t beyond Sea,</HI> as a Subject could ea&s;ily have: That &s;oon after this, he &s;hould undergo an hard <HI>Storm</HI> from the Endeavours of his Adver&s;aries to

<P>Mr. <HI>Phips</HI> received this unde&s;ired Paper with Trou|ble and with Contempt; and threw it by among cer|tain loo&s;e Papers, in the Bottom of a Trunk, where his Lady &s;ome Years after accidentally Lit upon it. His Lady with Admiration, &s;aw &s;tep after &s;tep, very much of it accompli&s;hed; but when &s;he heard from <HI>England,</HI> that Sir <HI>William</HI> was coming over with a Commi&s;&s;ion to be Governour of <HI>New-England,</HI> in that very Year of his Life, which the Paper &s;pecified, &s;he was afraid of letting it ly any longer in the Hou&s;e, but ca&s;t it into the <HI>Fire.</HI></P>
<P>Now the Thing which I mu&s;t invite my Reader to Remark is this; That albeit Almighty God may permit the <HI>Devils</HI> to <HI>predict,</HI> and perhaps to <HI>perform</HI> very many particular things to Men, that &s;hall by &s;uch a <HI>pre&s;umptuous and unwarrantable Juggle,</HI> as <HI>A&s;tro|logy</HI> (&s;o Dr. <HI>Hall</HI> well calls it!) or any other <HI>Di|vination,</HI> con&s;ult them, yet the <HI>Devils</HI> which <HI>fore-tel</HI> many <HI>True</HI> Things, do commonly <HI>fore-tel</HI> &s;ome that are <HI>Fal&s;e,</HI> and it may be propo&s;e by the Things that are <HI>True</HI> to betray Men into &s;ome fatal Mi&s;belief and Mi&s;carriage about tho&s;e that are <HI>Fal&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Very &s;ingular therefore was the Wi&s;dom of Sir <HI>William Phips,</HI> that, as he ever Treated the&s;e <HI>Pro|phecies</HI> about him with a mo&s;t <HI>Pious neglect,</HI> &s;o, when he had &s;een all but the <HI>two La&s;t</HI> of them ve|ry punctually fulfilled, yea and &s;een the beginning of a Fulfilment unto the <HI>La&s;t but one</HI> al&s;o, yet when I plea&s;antly mentioned them unto him, on purpo&s;e to <HI>Try</HI> whether there were any occa&s;ion for me humbly

<P>But Sir <HI>William Phips</HI> who might in a <HI>Calm</HI> of the Common-Wealth have admini&s;tred all things, with as General an Acceptance, as any that have gone before him, had the Di&s;advantage of being &s;et at <HI>Helm</HI> in a Time as full of <HI>Storm</HI> as ever that <HI>Province</HI> had &s;een; and the People having their Spirits put into a <HI>Tumult</HI> by the di&s;compo&s;ing and di&s;tempering Varie|ty of Di&s;a&s;ters, which had long been rendring the Time Calamitous, it was natural for them, as 'tis for all Men <HI>then,</HI> to be <HI>complaining;</HI> and you may be &s;ure, the <HI>Rulers</HI> mu&s;t in &s;uch Ca&s;es, be always <HI>complained</HI> of, and the chief Complaints mu&s;t be heaped upon tho&s;e that are <HI>Commanders in Chief.</HI> Nor has a certain Proverb in <HI>A&s;ia</HI> been improper in <HI>America, He de&s;erves no Man's good Word, of whom every Man &s;hall &s;peak well.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>William</HI> was very hardly <HI>Handled</HI> (or <HI>Torgued</HI> at lea&s;t) in the Liberty which People took to make mo&s;t unbecoming and Injurious Reflections upon his Conduct, and Clamour again&s;t him even for tho&s;e very Actions, which were not only <HI>Nece&s;&s;ary</HI> to be done, but highly <HI>Beneficial</HI> unto them&s;elves; And though he would ordinarily &s;mile at their <HI>Froward|ne&s;s,</HI> calling it, <HI>His Country Pay,</HI> yet he &s;ometimes re&s;ented it with &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s; he &s;eem'd unto him|&s;elf &s;ometimes almo&s;t as bad as Rolled about in <HI>Re|gulus</HI>'s Barrel; and had occa&s;ion to think on the <HI>Ita|lian</HI> Proverb, <HI>To wait for one who does not come; to ly a Bed not able to &s;leep; and to find it impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e tho&s;e whom we &s;erve, are three Griefs enough to kill a Man.</HI></P>
<P>But as <HI>Forward</HI> as the People were, under the <HI>Epedemical Vexations</HI> of the Age, yet there were ve|ry few that would not acknowledge unto the very La&s;t, <HI>It will be hardly po&s;&s;ible for us to &s;ee another Governour, that &s;hall more entirely Love and &s;erve the
<PB N="101" REF="59">Country:</HI> Yea, had the Country had the Choice of their own <HI>Governour,</HI> 'tis judged their <HI>Votes,</HI> more than forty to one, would have &s;till fallen upon him to have been the Man: And the <HI>General A&s;&s;embly</HI> therefore on all occa&s;ions renewed their Petitions un|to the King for his Continuance.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, there was a little Party of Men, who thought they mu&s;t not <HI>&s;leep till they had cau&s;ed him to fall:</HI> And they &s;o vigorou&s;ly pro&s;ecuted certain Articles before the Council-board at <HI>White-hal</HI> again&s;t him, that they imagined they had gained an <HI>Order</HI> of His Maje&s;ty in Council, to &s;u&s;pend him immedi|ately from his Government, and appoint a <HI>Committee</HI> of Per&s;ons nominated by his Enemies, to hear all <HI>De|po&s;itions</HI> again&s;t him; and &s;o a Report of the whole to be made unto the King and Council.</P>
<P>But His Maje&s;ty was too well informed of Sir <HI>William</HI>'s Integrity, to permit &s;uch a &s;ort of Proce|dure; and therefore He &s;ignified unto His mo&s;t Ho|nourable Council, that nothing &s;hould be done again&s;t Sir <HI>William,</HI> until he had Opportunity to clear him|&s;elf; and thereupon He &s;ent His Royal Commands unto Sir <HI>William</HI> to come over. To give any retort|ing Accounts of the Principal Per&s;ons, who thus ad|ver&s;aried him, would be a Thing &s;o contrary to the Spirit of Sir <HI>William Phips</HI> him&s;elf, who, at his leav|ing of <HI>New-England,</HI> bravely declared, that he <HI>freely forgave them all,</HI> and if he had returned thither a|gain, would never have taken the lea&s;t revenge up|on them, that <HI>This</HI> alone would oblige me, if I had no other Obligations of Chri&s;tianity upon me, to for|bear it; and it may be for &s;ome of them, it would be <HI>to throw Water upon a drowned Mou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Nor need I to preduce any more about the <HI>Ar|ticles</HI> which the&s;e Men exhibited again&s;t him, than <HI>This;</HI> that it was by mo&s;t Men believed, that if he would have connived at &s;ome <HI>Arbitrary Oppre&s;&s;ions</HI> too much u&s;ed by &s;ome kind of Officers, on the Kings
<PB N="102" REF="60">Subjects, <HI>Few</HI> perhaps, or <HI>None</HI> of tho&s;e Articles, had ever been formed; and that he apprehended him|&s;elf to be provided with a full <HI>Defence</HI> again&s;t them all.</P>
<P>Nor did His Excellency &s;eem loath to have had his Ca&s;e Tried under the Brazen Tree of <HI>Gariac,</HI> if there had been &s;uch an one, as that mentioned by the Fabulous <HI>Murtadi,</HI> in his Prodigies of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> a Tree which had Iron Branches with &s;harp <HI>Hooks</HI> at the End of them, that when any fal&s;e Accu&s;er ap|proached, as the Fable &s;ays, immediately flew at him, and &s;tuck in him, until he had cea&s;ed Injuring his Adver&s;ary.</P>
<P>Wherefore in Obedience unto the Kings Com|mands, he took his leave of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> on the &s;eventeenth of <HI>November,</HI> 1694. attended with all proper Te&s;ti|monies of Re&s;pect and Honour from the <HI>Body</HI> of the People, which he had been the <HI>Head</HI> unto; and with <HI>Addre&s;&s;es</HI> unto their Maje&s;ties, and the Chief Mini|&s;ters of State from the General A&s;&s;embly, humbly im|ploring, that they might not be deprived of the Hap|pine&s;s which they had in &s;uch an <HI>Head.</HI></P>
<P>Arriving at <HI>White-Hall,</HI> he found in a few Days, that notwith&s;tanding all the Impotent Rage of his Adver&s;aries particularly vented and Printed in a <HI>Vil|lanous Libel,</HI> as well as almo&s;t in as many other ways, as there are Mouths, at which <HI>Fyal</HI> &s;ometimes has vomited out its In&s;ernal Fires, he had all <HI>Hu|mane A&s;&s;urance</HI> of his returning in a very few Weeks again, the Governour of <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore, there were e&s;pecially <HI>two De&s;igns,</HI> full of Service to the whole <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, as well as his own particular Country of <HI>New-England,</HI> which he applied his <HI>Thoughts</HI> unto. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> He had a new <HI>Scene</HI> of Action opened unto him, in an opportunity to &s;upply the Crown with all <HI>Naval Stores</HI> at mo&s;t <HI>ea&s;ie Rates,</HI> from tho&s;e <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> Parts of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;et</HI> Province, which through the Conque&s;t that <HI>He</HI>
<PB N="103" REF="60">had made thereof, came to be In&s;erted in the <HI>Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;et</HI>-Charter. As no Man was more <HI>capable</HI> than <HI>He,</HI> to improve this opportunity unto a va&s;t Advan|tage, &s;o his <HI>Inclination</HI> to it, was according to his <HI>Ca|pacity.</HI></P>
<P>And he longed with &s;ome Impatience, to &s;ee the King furni&s;hed from his <HI>own Dominions,</HI> with &s;uch floating and &s;tately Ca&s;tles, tho&s;e <HI>Wooden-Walls</HI> of Great <HI>Britain,</HI> for much of which He has hitherto Traded with <HI>Forreign Kingdoms. Next,</HI> if I may &s;ay <HI>next</HI> unto this, he had an Eye upon <HI>Canada;</HI> all at|tempts for the reducing whereof had hitherto prov|ed Abortive.</P>
<P>It was but a few Months ago, that a con&s;iderable Fleet, under Sir <HI>Francis Wheeler,</HI> which had been &s;ent into the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> to &s;ubdue <HI>Martineco,</HI> was orde|red then to call at <HI>New-England,</HI> that being recruit|ed there, they might make a further De&s;cent upon <HI>Canada;</HI> but Heaven frowned upon that Expedition, e&s;pecially by a terrible Sickne&s;s, the mo&s;t like the <HI>Plague</HI> of any thing that has been ever &s;een in <HI>A|merica,</HI> whereof there Died, e're they could reach to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> as I was told by Sir <HI>Francis</HI> him&s;elf, no le&s;s than <HI>Thirteen</HI> Hundred Sailers out of <HI>Twenty One,</HI> and no le&s;s than <HI>Eighteen</HI> Hundred Souldiers out of <HI>Twen|ty four.</HI></P>
<P>It was now therefore his de&s;ire to have &s;atisfied the King, that his whole Intere&s;t in <HI>America</HI> lay at Stake, while <HI>Canada</HI> was in <HI>French</HI> Hands: And there|withal to have laid before &s;everal Noblemen, and Gentlemen, how beneficial an Undertaking it would have been for them to have pur&s;ued the <HI>Canadien</HI>-Bu&s;ine&s;s, for which the <HI>New-Englanders</HI> were now grown too Feeble; their Country being too far now, as <HI>Bede</HI> &s;ays <HI>England</HI> once was, <HI>Omni Milite &amp; floridae Juventutis Alacritate &s;poliata.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e <HI>two</HI> De&s;igns in the <HI>Thoughts</HI> of Sir <HI>William,</HI> there was a <HI>Third,</HI> which he had Hopes that
<PB N="104" REF="61">the King would have given him leave to have pur|&s;ued, after he had continued &s;o long in his Govern|ment, as to have obtained the more <HI>General welfare</HI> which he de&s;igned in the former In&s;tances. I do not mean the making of <HI>New-England</HI> the Seat of a <HI>Spani&s;h Trade,</HI> though &s;o va&s;tly profitable a Thing was likely to have been brought about, by his being one of an Honourable Company engaged in &s;uch a Project.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Spani&s;h Wreck,</HI> where Sir <HI>William</HI> had made his fir&s;t <HI>good Voyage,</HI> was not the <HI>only,</HI> nor the <HI>Rich|e&s;t</HI> Wreck, that he knew to be lying under the Wa|ter. He knew particularly that when the Ship, which had Governour <HI>Boadilla</HI> Aboard, was ca&s;t a|way, there was, as <HI>Peter Martyr</HI> &s;ays, an entire Ta|ble of <HI>Gold</HI> of <HI>Three Thou&s;and, Three Hundred and ten Pound Weight.</HI></P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Albemarl</HI>'s Patent for all &s;uch <HI>Wrecks</HI> now expiring, Sir <HI>William</HI> thought on the <HI>Motto,</HI> which is upon the Gold <HI>Medal,</HI> be&s;towed by the late King, with his <HI>Knighthood</HI> upon him, <HI>Semper Tibi pendeat Hamus:</HI> And &s;uppo&s;ing him&s;elf to have gain|ed &s;ufficient Information of the right Way to &s;uch a <HI>Wreck,</HI> it was his purpo&s;e upon his Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from his Government, once more to have gone unto his old <HI>Fi&s;hing-Trade,</HI> upon a mighty Shelf of Rocks and Bank of Sands, that ly where he had informed him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>But as the Prophet <HI>Haggai</HI> and <HI>Zechariah,</HI> in their <HI>P&s;alm</HI> upon the Grants made unto their People by the Emperours of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> have that Reflection, <HI>Man's Breath goeth forth, he returns to his Earth; in that very Day his Thoughts peri&s;h.</HI> My Reader mu&s;t now &s;ee what came of all the&s;e con&s;iderable <HI>Thoughts.</HI> About the middle of <HI>February</HI> 1694. Sir <HI>William</HI> found him&s;elf indi&s;po&s;ed with a Cold, which obliged him to keep his Chamber; but under this Indi&s;po|&s;ition, he received the Honour of a Vi&s;it from a ve|ry

<P>After all, I do not know that I have been, by any per&s;onal Obligations or Circum&s;tances, charmed into any <HI>Partiality</HI> for the <HI>Memory</HI> of this Worthy Man; but I do here from a real Satisfaction of Con|&s;cience concerning him, declare to all the World, that I reckon him, to have been really a very <HI>Wor|thy Man;</HI> that few Men in the World ri&s;ing from &s;o mean an <HI>Original,</HI> as he, would have acquitted them&s;elves with a thou&s;andth Part of his <HI>Capacity</HI> or <HI>Integrity;</HI> that he left unto the World a notable Example of a Di&s;po&s;ition to <HI>Do Good,</HI> and encountred and overcame almo&s;t invincible <HI>Temptations</HI> in doing it.</P>
<P>And I do mo&s;t &s;olemnly Profe&s;s, that I have mo&s;t con&s;cientiou&s;ly endeavoured the utmo&s;t Sincerity and Veracity of a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> as well as an <HI>Hi&s;torian</HI> in the <HI>Hi&s;tory,</HI> which I have now given of him.

<P>And I will &s;ay this further; That when certain Per&s;ons had found the <HI>Skull</HI> of a <HI>Dead Man,</HI> as a <HI>Greek</HI> Writer of Epigrams has told us, they all fell a Weeping, but only one of the Company, who Laughed and Flouted, and through an unheard of Cruelty, threw <HI>Stones</HI> at it, which <HI>Stones</HI> wonderful|ly rebounded back upon the Face of him that threw

<P>But the Name of Sir <HI>WILLIAM PHIPS</HI> will be heard Honourably mentioned in the <HI>Trum|pets</HI> of <HI>Immortal Fame,</HI> when the Names of many, that <HI>Antipathied</HI> him, will either be Buried in Eter|nal Oblivion, without any <HI>Sacer Vates</HI> to pre&s;erve them, or be remembred, but like that of <HI>Pilate</HI> in the Go&s;pel, or <HI>Judas</HI> in the Creed, with Eternal Infamy.</P>
<P>The old <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> indeed, according to the Report of <HI>Agathias,</HI> expo&s;ed their <HI>Dead</HI> Friends to be Torn in pieces by <HI>Wild Bea&s;ts,</HI> believing that if they lay long <HI>unworried,</HI> they had been <HI>unworthy</HI> Per&s;ons; but, all attempts of &s;urviving Malice, to demon&s;trate in that way, the <HI>worth</HI> of this <HI>Dead</HI> Gentleman, give me leave to <HI>Rate off</HI> with Indignation.</P>

<P>And there now remains nothing more for <HI>me</HI> to do about it, but only to recite herewithal, a well-known Story related by <HI>Suidas,</HI> That an <HI>Envious</HI> Man, once going to pull down a <HI>Statue,</HI> which had been rai&s;ed unto the Memory of one whom he maligned, he only got this by it, that the <HI>Statue</HI> falling down, knock'd out his Brains.</P>
<P>But <HI>Poetry</HI> as well as <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> mu&s;t pay it's dues unto him. If <HI>Cicero</HI>'s Poem intituled <HI>Quadrigae,</HI> where|in he did with a <HI>Poetical Chariot</HI> extol the Exploits of <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> in <HI>Britain</HI> to the very Skies, were now Ex|tant in the World, I would have Borrowed &s;ome <HI>Flights</HI> of <HI>That</HI> at lea&s;t, for the Subject now to be Adorned.</P>
<P>But in&s;tead thereof, let the Reader accept the en|&s;uing <HI>Elegy.</HI></P>
