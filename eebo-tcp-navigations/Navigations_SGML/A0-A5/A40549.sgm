<P>LEtters ye&s;terday Afternoon (by three <HI>Flanders Mails</HI>) of the 21&s;t. in&s;tant from <HI>Vienna</HI> bring us the Joyful increa&s;e, and Particulars of the Intire and Accompli&s;h'd Victory the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Army have obtain'd over the <HI>Turks,</HI> near <HI>Darda</HI> the, 12th. Courant, for which Glorious Atchievment, their Imperial Maje&s;ties attended by all the Nobility of that Court, paid their Devotions in the Cathedral of St. <HI>Stephen,</HI> where <HI>Te Deum</HI> was Sung (with a Royal <HI>Salvo</HI>) of a Triple Di&s;charge of all the Canon upon the Ramparts, continued by Vollies of Mu&s;quets, Re&s;ounding with Ringing of Bells, Bonefires, and Acclamations of the People; the &s;ame being brought the Emperor from the Duke of <HI>Lorain,</HI> by General Count <HI>Taaffe,</HI> &s;ince the di&s;patch of Prince <HI>Eugine</HI> of <HI>Savoy.</HI></P>
<P>The better to con&s;erve the Method of acquiring this mighty Action, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary at fir&s;t to know the Inducement that oblig'd the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> to quit his Impregnable Retrenchment, and give Battle to the <HI>Chri&s;tians;</HI> on the 27th. the Grand <HI>Vizier</HI> pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Drave</HI> with his Army, and Fortified his Camp near <HI>Darda,</HI> with two Modern Retrenchments in the Front, &s;trengthned with <HI>Palli&s;ados,</HI> having <HI>E&s;&s;eck</HI> and the <HI>Drave</HI> in his Rear, the <HI>Danube</HI> and the <HI>Mora&s;s</HI> on his right, with a Wood and a <HI>Mora&s;s</HI> on his left; which being view'd by the Generals, 'twas judg'd Impo&s;&s;ible without hazar|ding the Ruine of the whole Army, to attaque and force his Camp; there|fore 'twas re&s;olv'd by &s;ome Stratagams of War, to draw the Grand <HI>Vizier</HI> from tho&s;e &s;ecured Retrenchments, &s;o March'd and Counter-march'd the Army in divers Figures, one Detatchment of them making &s;hew as if they would repa&s;s the <HI>Danube</HI> at <HI>Mohaez,</HI> and go into high <HI>Hungary,</HI> whil&s;t another made a feigned movement, of Marching towards <HI>Sygeth</HI> and <HI>Syclo&s;s,</HI> not without being able &s;uddenly to re-unite their Main Body, which the <HI>Turks</HI> perceiving, look'd upon it at fir&s;t, as really it was intended, to decoy him out of his Po&s;t; and thereupon would &s;carce permit the Ravaging <HI>Tar|tars</HI> to pick up &s;ome of our <HI>Forrigers,</HI> till believing they might be retreating in earne&s;t, made &s;ome Detatchments to ob&s;erve the Countenance of our Army, and &s;ometimes Skirmi&s;hed with our advanced Guards, gave us the Alarm; and having taken 200. of our Men, return'd to the Camp (flu&s;hed with this advantage) the <HI>Turks</HI> began to &s;hew them&s;elves in different Parties; our Generals contrived new Methods, Marching their Armies in &s;everal Fronts further afield, as well to be di&s;tant from a Wood, which incommo|ded our <HI>Foragers,</HI> as to give the Grand <HI>Vizier</HI> a larger &s;pace of Ground with de&s;ire to follow us; But this March was yet in vain, yet notwith&s;tanding, the &s;ame day we perceived a con&s;iderable Body of <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Cavalry in our Rear; But &s;o &s;oon as we faced about, and began to Skirmi&s;h with them, they made a ha&s;ty Retreat: The Duke of <HI>Lorain,</HI> by this time, judging that he &s;hould not be able to cau&s;e him to give Battle in open Field, took a re&s;olution to March for <HI>Syclo&s;s</HI> and <HI>Five-Churches,</HI> and withdraw tho&s;e Garri&s;ons, Demoli&s;hing the Fortifications, which otherwi&s;e might have fallen into the Enemies po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, began to move towards them on the 10th. and with ea&s;ie Marches, continued the 11th. &s;ending Baron <HI>De
<PB N="2" REF="2" MS="y">Orlick</HI> to precede the Vant-Guard with 4 or 500 Hor&s;e; In this March, a great Body of <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Spahies did what they could to interrupt our mo|tion, &s;hewing them&s;elves &s;ometimes on the Wing, then on the Flanks; We enter'd upon Di&s;pute with them, but they Retired with recipitation: On the Twelfth, the Grand <HI>Vizier</HI> thinking the <HI>CHRISTIANS</HI> were making the be&s;t of their way from him, would not loo&s;e the opportunity, but detach'd &s;ome of his be&s;t Troops, to give us a Diver&s;ion; and about two in the Afternoon 10000 <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Cavalry, and half the number of <HI>Janizaries</HI> came right upon our Left Wing, Commanded by the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> and Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Baden,</HI> preceded by &s;ome <HI>German Curia&s;iers,</HI> who vigo|rou&s;ly &s;u&s;tain'd the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Charge, but retir'd into their fir&s;t Line: on a &s;ud|dain The <HI>Janizaries</HI> were Po&s;ted on an Eminence, with &s;ome Field-Pieces, and made continual Firing with &s;mall Shot, whil&s;t 10000 of their Hor&s;e en|deavour'd to put us in Di&s;order, which oblidg'd the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> to extend his Front to be in proportion with that of the Enemy, the Regi|ments of <HI>Savoy</HI> and <HI>Comercy</HI> &s;u&s;tain'd this fir&s;t Charge, which was very fierce and ob&s;tinate; the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> continuing firm with great Re&s;olution and Courage, notwith&s;tanding they were Attaqu'd in Front and Flank, the E|lector came in Per&s;on to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and found the Di&s;pute &s;o warm, that he received a Shot in his Hand, Prince <HI>Comercy</HI> a Wound in the Brea&s;t with an Arrow, which yet did not hinder his continuing in the Action, to give what nece&s;&s;ary Orders were requir'd.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Lorain</HI> to get ground, cau&s;es at the &s;ame time, the Right Wing to March cro&s;s, and &s;tretch towards the Flank of the Enemies, who Attack'd on the Left, and the Left went to meet another Body of Hor&s;e and Foot which March'd to Charge them, and now the Fight began to be bloo|dy on both &s;ides, the Victory hanging in &s;u&s;pen&s;e for two or three hours; but by the coming in of a fre&s;h Detachment on the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> &s;ide, the <HI>Turks</HI> began to lo&s;e ground, afterwards to mend their pace; and in the end, to take a perfect Flight. One Body of their Cavalry relying upon their Foot, put the whole in di&s;order; a great Slaughter being made, and we pur&s;u'd the Enemy with &s;o much Rigour and Heat, that we enter'd Pell Mell into their <HI>Camp;</HI> and made our &s;elves with little re&s;i&s;tance, Ma&s;ters of both the En|trenchments, and pur&s;ued the Enemy as long as the day would permit. This Victory is &s;o great, as not to have any parallel for &s;ome Ages: We drove many into the <HI>Mora&s;s</HI> and <HI>Drave,</HI> where they peri&s;hed; the Bridge over the River, through the weight of People thronging to get over, broke down; &s;ome &s;ay the Grand <HI>Vizier</HI> caus'd the &s;ame to be done, leaving a multitude on this &s;ide the <HI>Drave,</HI> who are retir'd to the <HI>Woods, Mar&s;hes,</HI> and <HI>I&s;les,</HI> where they are &s;hut up: and mu&s;t Surrender upon di&s;cretion, for want of Food: And &s;ome Per&s;ons report that there is no le&s;s than 25 or 30000 Men thus di|&s;pers'd. And of 15000 old <HI>Jani&s;aries,</HI> &s;carce 50 are &s;aved; and they reckon above 20000 are Kill'd and Drown'd. They have Sei&s;ed a mighty Rich Booty, the Grand <HI>Vizier</HI>'s Tent, which is fell to the Lot of the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> is &s;o Rich in <HI>Gold, Pearl, Precious Stones,</HI> &amp;c. as is ine&s;timable. 116 <HI>Cannon,</HI> and <HI>Mortars</HI> taken, 6000 Head of Cattle, 1500 <HI>Camels,</HI> an hundred <HI>Buffulors</HI> &s;eized 2000 Waggons with Provi&s;ion and Ammunition, are fell into our Hands, a number of Tents, Standards, and Hor&s;es Tails, and there is &s;carce a Souldier but abounds in Gold and Silver. The Pri&s;oners al&s;o Report, that the Grand <HI>Vizier</HI> had not been induced to come out of his Retrenchments, but by the Per&s;wa&s;ion of &s;ome <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> in his Army, who Flatter'd him with a&s;&s;urance of Succe&s;s; and that they &s;hould certainly take Pri&s;oners the Dukes of <HI>Lorain</HI> and <HI>Bavaria;</HI> and thereby oblige the Empe|rour to make Peace with the Grand <HI>Seigneur,</HI> and re&s;tore all the places in <HI>Hun|gary</HI> he has Conquer'd during the War: But Providence has di&s;pos'd other|wi&s;e, and 'tis not to be doubted, but that this Glorious Victory will have a quite contrary Effect.</P>
