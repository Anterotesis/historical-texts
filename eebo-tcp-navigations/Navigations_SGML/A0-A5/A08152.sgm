<HEAD>THE VVONDERFVLL PROCEEDINGS AND progre&s;&s;es of Count <HI>Mansfield in the</HI> PALATINATE, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_I Mu&s;t needs now remember the returne of the explorators of the Land of <HI>Ca|naan,</HI> who terrified the people, with a report of Enachims and Giants, yron gates, and high Towers, &s;trong walles, and impregnable Bulwarkes, great Ar|mies, and formidable Soldiours, onely <HI>Caleb</HI> and <HI>Io&s;hua</HI> oppo&s;ed them&s;elues with a contrary di&s;couery of a plentifull Countrey, and large inheritance; for which the people had like to haue &s;toned them. Thus haue they dealt with the King of <HI>Bo|hemia,</HI> euer &s;ince the lo&s;&s;e of <HI>Prague,</HI> and <HI>Spinola's</HI> entring into the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> geering and deriding his attempts, as if it were impo&s;&s;ible to pro&s;ecute any enterpri&s;e again&s;t the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> and with&s;tand the King of Spaines Ar|mies, with &s;uch auxiliary Princes, as depend vpon his So|ueraignty: whereupon they haue not onely &s;corned his Election, but taught their tongues a le&s;&s;on of defamation, and their hands a cunning of deciphering his weakene&s;&s;e and temerity, in many calumnious Pictures, and &s;canda|lous reports, neuer remembring <HI>Ahabs</HI> little cloude, and what an inundation of raine it grew vnto, nor the childrens of <HI>I&s;raell</HI> making of Bricke in the Land of <HI>Go&s;hen,</HI> and what
<PB N="2" REF="3">a glorious Nation they came vnto, nor the deridings of <HI>Sanbolet</HI> and <HI>Tobias,</HI> when they re-edified the Temple, and how they preuayled in de&s;pight of oppo&s;ition: nor in a worde, how the Church of God for all the watchings of the Dragon in the Wilderne&s;&s;e, hath beene &s;till delinered like that woman, and flouri&s;hed in the end for all her hard beginnings, and outragious aduer&s;aries; and why may not time bring foorth the like birth for the happy deliuerance of the Palatinate, and her Ma&s;ter, for all this thicke han|ging cloud ouer her head, threatning a tempe&s;t of vtter de&s;truction, and de&s;olation.</P>
<P>But my meaning is, not to trouble you with repititions, or vnbinde the fardell of tumor, concerning former mat|ters; wherein you &s;hall finde her garment be-painted with many tongues on the out&s;ide, and as many hearts on the in&s;ide, to intimate thus much, that men will be talking ac|cording to the di&s;po&s;ition of their hearts: &s;ome like Pa|pi&s;ts, &s;ome like Polliticians, &s;ome like irreligious Neuters, &s;ome like Hi&s;paniolized in&s;truments, &s;ome like true Pro|te&s;tants, and euery one as their fancy induceth: Nay, I will not &s;peake a worde of former preparations, nor how the Duke of <HI>Bauaria</HI> proued &s;o good a Seruitour to the Emperour, that vpon his comming into the Palatinate, the Papi&s;ts about <HI>Vdenhem,</HI> in the vpper part of the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Spires,</HI> made a Comedy of the lo&s;t King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> as they tearmed him, and v&s;ed many vn&s;eemely &s;peeches a|gain&s;t him in that Interlude, with &s;uch vndecencies, that England it &s;elfe e&s;caped not their &s;candalous minortiues: but it pa&s;&s;ed not away with that &s;uccesfull jollity as they pretended, for the comming downe of Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> quickly &s;topped all their mouthes, and quenched the heat of the&s;e burning reproches; as for tho&s;e vn&s;auory vntruths of making compo&s;ition of agreement with the Emperour,
<PB N="3" REF="3">or Duke of <HI>Bauaria:</HI> there neuer was &s;uch a thought, nor motiue, either of reuolt from the King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> or re|conciliation to them, and therefore of him onely and his proceedings, according to the Poet: <HI>Arma virum&abque; vno,</HI> I will now &s;peake, and &s;hew you by Gods grace the &s;ucce&s;&s;e of his affaires, and then iudge your &s;elues what po&s;&s;ibility he &s;tands in, and whether fairer dayes may come in the &s;tead of tempe&s;tuous weather, yea, I make no que&s;tion (according to another Poet:)</P>
<Q>Saepe premente Deo fert Deus alter opem.</Q>
<P>The 14 of October 1621. his Excellency, for &s;o we mu&s;t &s;tile him: or Generall, with his whole Army came out of the vpper Palatinate toward <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">delberg,</HI> being eight Re|giments of foote, containing 108. Companies, and 56. Cornets of Hor&s;e, &s;omewhat weake, and wearyed with long Marches, yet were they 10000. &s;trong by Pole: but hearing of the &s;iege of <HI>Franckendale,</HI> they &s;tayed not long there, as re&s;oluing to rai&s;e it, and releeue the Countrey, to which they were the rather animated, becau&s;e that Gene|rall <HI>Vere</HI> &s;ent Colonel <HI>Ouertrant</HI> out of <HI>Mainhem,</HI> with fixe Cornets of Hor&s;e, foure Demy Cannons, and two Pieces of &s;ixe pound bullets vnto him, who were welcommed ac|cordingly, and &s;o his Excellency with 2000. in his owne Regiment. Colonell <HI>Mer&s;en</HI> with 1200. Colonell <HI>Wald|mans Haw&s;en</HI> with 2000. and part of a new Regiment vnder Colonell <HI>Band&s;haw,</HI> being 1000. with foure Pieces more: be&s;ides tho&s;e which Colonell <HI>Ouertrant</HI> brought, marched pre&s;ently to <HI>Franckendale;</HI> but the Enemy hearing of his approach, disbandied them&s;elues, and left the &s;iege, reti|ring toward <HI>Wormes:</HI> yet fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the Bridge, they had made right ouer again&s;t <HI>Steine.</HI></P>
<P>But this was not &s;o couertly done, but they of <HI>Franc|kendale</HI> had notice of the &s;ame, and made a braue Salley,
<PB N="4" REF="4">wherein the Engli&s;h, whom Generall <HI>Vere</HI> had left in Ga|ri&s;on, there performed their partes like hone&s;t men, and worthy Soldiers, for there were forty of the Enemy &s;laine, an Italian Captaine with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">n En&s;igne taken pri&s;oners, and many others ouertaken in the flight; by which occa&s;ion they were freed of the &s;iege, and deliuered from the feare of vtter de&s;truction: For although the Towne was well fortified and had many Bulwarkes and Trenches, which Generall <HI>Vere</HI> before his departure had ouer&s;eene, and pre|pared: yet were they not &s;o perfected and warrantable, but &s;uch an Army, as the Spaniard had of 9000. at lea&s;t, might in time either batter, or enforce, con&s;idering the Gari&s;on decayed, and proui&s;ion failed: but God was their protec|tor, and as you haue heard, &s;ent this &s;upply to put new life into their courages, and relieue their di&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Now the &s;iege of Franckendale was in this manner; the Enemy taking aduantage of Generall <HI>Veres</HI> retiring to Mainhem, came with 9000. before it, and for foure weekes continually battered the Bulwarks; but by rea&s;on he had not taken in any of the Scon&s;es, nor di&s;mantled the prin|cipall out-works, he could not endamage the Towne it &s;elfe. Nay: when he had valiantly and fortunately got in|to the Counter&s;carfe, he was forced out againe with the lo&s;&s;e of 100. men, and taught to know, that a &s;tronger arme putteth out the &s;trong man: yet not altogether di&s;|heartned, as re&s;olued, that Honour worketh vpon difficult attempts, he obtained a halfe Moone, from whence he was al&s;o fiered, and repul&s;ed with the like lo&s;&s;e: For when we perceiued, that they were Ma&s;ters of the &s;ame, and in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Trenches, we pre&s;ently made a Mine, which pro&s;pered &s;o well, that we blew them into the ayre: For the Towne hauing a pa&s;&s;age at the back of the halfe Moon after the fa&s;hion of rauelings, we did the better effect our
<PB N="5" REF="4">purpo&s;e, though the worke it &s;elfe was quite defaced. There was al&s;o another halfe Moone &s;omewhat le&s;&s;e made vpon the ditches, which likewi&s;e the Enemy attempted; but belike hearing of the failing of the former, they de|&s;i&s;ted, although they had made many brauadoes to a&s;&s;ault euen the ditches them&s;elues, wherein they might haue en|dangered their whole Army: For they were &s;o well de|fended, that 3000. men could not &s;urpri&s;e them, then had they the wall to come to, which mu&s;t haue endangered them a great deale more: nay, if they had obtained the wall, which mu&s;t be done with the like lo&s;&s;e: there were many Scafferies behind, and a new wall begun to be made, which al&s;o would haue much endamaged them: &s;o that by the iudgement of experienced Souldiers, and the &s;ucce&s;&s;e of that, wherein they had beene engaged, con&s;idering they could not bring the Cannon to batter for the out-workes, this Army would que&s;tionle&s;&s;e haue been con&s;umed in ob|taining this one place, and yet they might haue failed to. For in three weekes they lo&s;t 3000. men, and diuers per|&s;ons of account, be&s;ides great Officers and Captaines, who&s;e bodies were embalmed and &s;ent to Stein: but (God be thanked) to preuent our further feare, and vaine &s;uppo|&s;es of what might haue beene done on both &s;ides, the com|ming of Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> preuented all our accounts, and the Enemy departed within foure dayes toward Wormes, &s;o that the Generall came not to Franckendale at all, but pre&s;ently followed the Enemy to Wormes, and there en|camped him&s;elfe round about the 18. of October, whether repaired Generall <HI>Vere,</HI> &amp; &s;ome Engli&s;h Captaines, hauing lea&s;ure to treat of their affaires, &amp; &s;end to Heidelberg, and other places both to comfort &amp; &s;upply them: But the truth is, we determined to &s;et vpon the Enemy at his Bridge, had we not found many inconueniences in the &s;ame.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="5">
<P>For as he lay betweene the Rhein and a Mar&s;h, well in|trenched and in&s;con&s;ed by Stein, wee could not come at him, or if you will, dur&s;t not &s;et vpon him, becau&s;e men were precious vnto vs, and many wants came vpon vs, be|&s;ides the time of yeere which threatned vs with vn&s;ea&s;o|nable weather, the Countrey was al&s;o forraged, and the warres had looked vpon this flouri&s;hing Prouince, with as angry a countenance, as when &s;he threatned to depopu|late, and de&s;troy a Countrey indeed: For both the Enemy and our &s;elues mu&s;t be here, and now &s;upplied: Where|vpon his Excellency about the 22. of October re&s;olued to retire, and di&s;pierce his Army, and &s;o &s;ome went to Franc|kendale: &s;ome returned with Generall <HI>Vere</HI> to Mainhem: both the Colonels <HI>Mer&s;en, Band&s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">w</HI> went to Heidelberg, and his Excellency him&s;elfe departed to Mainhem, but ta|ried not long, by rea&s;on of many inconueniences: &s;o hee ob&s;cured his time, and pa&s;&s;ed ouer the Bridge into the Bi&s;hoprick of Spires, taking all places he came at, and ran|&s;acking euery Town, wherein he determined not to recide except Vdenhem: from thence vnder&s;tanding of the &s;len|der guard of other places, he deuided his Army, &s;ending &s;ome forces to Ben&s;hem, &s;ome to Heppenhem, and &s;ome to Weinhem, all which he quickly &s;urpri&s;ed, taking the &s;poile for his Souldiers, &amp; as quickly for&s;ooke, when the Enemy approched, who indeede watched him very narrowly: Yet Colonell <HI>Tilley</HI> pa&s;&s;ed mo&s;t indu&s;triou&s;ly to Badenberg, &amp; there made a Bridge ouer the Necker, and rai&s;ed a Scon&s;e right again&s;t Neckerhau&s;en, where he quartred him&s;elfe, as his Excellency had done in other places, to the refre&s;hing of his Souldiers, and enriching his Army.</P>
<P>Till this the Bauarians were at variance with the Spani|ards, and &s;ome vnkindne&s;&s;e aro&s;e about Precedency of places: For the Spani&s;h Generall <HI>Don Cordona</HI> would not
<PB N="7" REF="5">giue place to the Bauarians, which Colonell <HI>Tilley</HI> challen|ged, as lying neere&s;t the Enemy, and skirmi&s;hing often with his Excellency, whereupon they fell to blowes, and that at la&s;t deuided them a&s;&s;under: &s;o the Bauarians going ouer Odenwald, tooke Mosbach, and Ederback on the Necker, and al&s;o Steinbach, and Schonam, which hee might doe with ea&s;e, con&s;idering Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> retur|ned once againe to Mainhem about the 13. of Nouember, and &s;o was this Bi&s;hoprick of Spieres to&s;&s;ed as it were be|tweene two Seas, and ready to be &s;wallowed of either: For both the Armies were needy, and the belly hauing no eares, nor eyes to di&s;cerne parties, called for meat, and en|tertained all that came.</P>
<P>But what with the nece&s;&s;ity of his affaires, &amp; the &s;tirring|nes of his &s;pirit, his Excellency could not re&s;t long in a place, &amp; &s;o the 15 of Nouem went ouer the Bridge againe, taking in Diete&s;hen, which after 8. Cannon &s;hot yeelded without re&s;i&s;tance, wherein Duke <HI>Saxon Lowanbord</HI> &s;tayed with his Regiment. From thence the 16. of Nouember, his Excellency took Keichweild Towne, and a Ca&s;tle &s;tanding in a mar&s;h by compo&s;ition: for it &s;hould &s;eeme both Cap|taine and Souldiers (though for the mo&s;t part Subiects of the Bi&s;hoprick of Spires) were well addicted to his Excel|lency, and &s;o yeelded without battery, making interce&s;&s;ion to &s;erue him, and &s;o they were entertained, and remained among&s;t vs, &amp; the rather, becau&s;e the Enemy was &s;trong in the&s;e parts &amp; places, as lodging the chiefe Lieutenant Co|lonell <HI>Lipp,</HI> vnder <HI>Graue Rheinhart van Solmes,</HI> with his Regi|ment, and 2000. Hor&s;e vnder the <HI>Saxon Lowanbord,</HI> who were all di&s;pier&s;ed, for maintainance in the Countrey, and lay thus vpon aduantage to &s;et forward the &s;eruice.</P>
<P>The 18. of Nouember we marched toward Lunterbord, taking both the Ca&s;tle and the Towne without re&s;i&s;tance.
<PB N="8" REF="6">For the Inhabitants hearing of our approach, abandoned their dwellings, except 10. Burgers, and the Secretary of the State, who &s;ubmitted them&s;elues, and admitted of our preuailing: the re&s;t of the people fled &s;ome houre be|fore we came, whereby we found much Hou&s;hold-&s;tuffe, apparell, and linnen; all which fell to the Souldiers, by his Excellencies appointment, who de&s;iring rather money, then to be encombred with &s;uch vnportable &s;tuffe, &s;old that for a Florine, which was worth tenne: for when peace and &s;afe conduct was proclaimed to all, that would returne, and repo&s;&s;e&s;&s;e their hou&s;es, many came backe againe and redeemed their furniture at ea&s;ie rates: &s;o his Excellency made his chiefe quarter here, and grew &s;o &s;trong, that the Townes both of Wormes and Spiers, de&s;ired his Protecti|on, and paid great &s;ummes of money, the one was granted, the other receiued; by who&s;e example other Townes con|di&s;cended likewi&s;e to contribution: For Landaw and Wei&s;enburg, both rickes Townes; disbur&s;ed great &s;ums: Haggenaw paid 5000. ricks dollers, and hath yeelded her &s;elfe with the tender of all &s;eruice, and the &s;upply of his Excellencies wants, e&s;pecially to &s;end him Prouant and Munition, if he went to Lanterburg, yea all the places and people &s;ubmitted them&s;elues, and applauded his fidelity and endurances.</P>
<P>In&s;o much, that from the 18. of Nouember, to the 25. there a&s;&s;embled &s;o great a number of Earles, Barons, Colonels, Captaines, and Gentlemen, be&s;ides the wonderfull con|cur&s;e of people, that as it is one way incredible, &s;o is it another way remarkable, that either the per&s;on or the cau&s;e &s;hould thriue &s;o &s;uddainely, and again&s;t all expectation: euery man offering his &s;eruice to his Excellency, and euery thing giuing waie to his fortunes, and the &s;ucce&s;&s;e of his enterpri&s;es, <HI>Don Court,</HI> a Baron of Loraine, hath mu&s;tred
<PB N="9" REF="6">600. Hor&s;e: Graue <HI>Ca&s;simire van Lowe&s;tein</HI> 1000. Colonell <HI>Carle&s;ton</HI> 600. Hor&s;e, and to make the Companies com|pleat both with Foot and Hor&s;e, Commi&s;&s;ions were gran|ted about the end of Nouember, to rai&s;e 6000. Foot more, whereof the mo&s;t part are come already: &s;o that in my con|&s;cience, if multitudes of men will performe any exploit, here are men enough to ouer-runne a Kingdome; or if tho&s;e men they haue may be paid and kept together, here are &s;pi|rits, that propo&s;e great matters to them&s;elues, and as great &s;eruice to their Generall. The Duke of Bulloigne propor|tioneth 4000. Foot, and 1000. Hor&s;e. The Prince of Wit|tenberg with diuers great States, and other Ricks Townes promi&s;e faire, and &s;end his Excellency word, they haue al|ready 8000. in Armes, and at the Spring will make them vp 15000. for the defence of the Palatinate; and as it &s;hould &s;eeme, all the Princes of the Vnion, &s;omewhat a&s;hamed of their former retraction, will rea&s;&s;ume new courages, and make a triall of new fortunes: &s;o that by this computation, if we may flatter our &s;elues with the hopes of promi&s;es, and coadiutements of men, &s;uch as the Romanes were wont to Auxiliary forces, and Pre&s;idiary Colonies, the King of Bohemia reckoning his own helps, may pre&s;ume of 60000. men: but yet farre be it from pre&s;umption, becau&s;e God worketh many times with le&s;&s;er number greater workes, then either the recouery of the Palatinate, or Kingdome of Bohemia.</P>
<P>To this we may adde that Army which is already vnder the commands of <HI>Iohn George</HI> Marque&s;&s;e of Iaggendorpe, and the Earle of Thorn, being at the lea&s;t 16000. &s;trong in Bohemia, and the Prouinces of Sile&s;ia and Morauia, for all the threatnings of the Duke of Saxony, and incon&s;tancy of the Citizens of Prague, and why may I not name the Hun|garians, and Tran&s;iluanians vnder <HI>Bethelem Gabor,</HI> who
<PB N="10" REF="7">que&s;tionle&s;&s;e will not deale ingenerou&s;ly with the King of Bohemia, but &s;tep in as a &s;harer in this recouery, and keepe all the contracts in de&s;pight of rumour, that will haue him at peace with the Emperour, or at lea&s;t at truce in this time of his ab&s;ence from Vienna, as is reported, that he is gone toward Italy about a marriage: But whether it be &s;o or no, &s;uch be the Letters, &s;uch is the report, and euery man &s;tands gazing on the&s;e preparations, as if they were to be|hold &s;ome prodigious comet, falling onely into the &s;cru|ple of coniecture, what &s;hould be the i&s;&s;ue of both. For my part I leaue all to the vn&s;earchable prouidence of God, and returne to the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e in hand, which turneth me ouer to a new worke.</P>
<P>By the occa&s;ion of the&s;e warres, and dilacerating the peace and plenty of Countries, this goodly Prouince of the Palatinate had come into the hands of cruell v&s;urpers, and vnnaturall &s;trangers, who haue re&s;pected nothing, but the pre&s;ent time, and &s;upplying of wants, not caring what became of her hereafter, nor how deformed they made her for to welcome her owne parents: For they cut downe her Woods, euen before Franckendale, and other places, to preuent annoyance from the Enemy, who kept in the &s;ame as vnder &s;helter, and from thence made many &s;allyes vpon the people, and lay as it were in Ambu&s;cado to &s;urpri&s;e the Souldiers: they ouer-trampled her Vines, and made the hoofes of their Hor&s;es &s;peake cruelly to the rootes: they digged vp her fields for Trenches and Bulwarks: they pul|led downe their hou&s;es round about their Townes to rai&s;e rauelings and counter&s;carps, they oppre&s;&s;ed the people, &s;uffering no man to enioy his owne, nor to giue it away to whom they plea&s;ed: &s;o that they which before in a manner liued &s;ecurely without walls, and fortifications, are not now &s;afe within walls, trenches, and the mounting of Can|nons:
<PB N="11" REF="7">and this is the mi&s;ery of di&s;cention, and the rage of Princes, who will not be pacified without mi&s;chiefe and reuenge, as is apparant all ouer Bohemia, and tho&s;e Coun|tries, where the Enemies haue come in with the &s;ound of ho&s;tility: &s;o that if any demand, why Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI> be|ing &s;o &s;trong, &s;o well prouided, and befriended, doth not returne into the Palatinate, and either contriue the rendi|tion, or pro&s;ecute the Enemies expul&s;ion. I an&s;wer plainly: 1. The Souldiers loue the &s;poile better then pay, and &s;o are kept together with the hopes of reward, and enriching them&s;elues. 2. Secondly, the Palatinate being thus for|raged, will not &s;upply the wants of &s;o great an Army. 3. Thirdly, they mu&s;t be con&s;umed again&s;t fortified tren|ches and Scon&s;es: For they will not come to a maine bat|tell except they li&s;t. 4. Fourthly, trea&s;ure being wa&s;ted, he is not &s;ure alwaies to pay them, and it is a rule in Mar|tiall di&s;cipline, not to let the Souldier want, while he lieth in the field. 5. For all his Excellency be thus forward, yet is he &s;ubiect to direction, and expecteth more friends. 6. La&s;t of all, to expul&s;e the Spaniard &amp; Bauarian by force out of the Palatinate, mu&s;t co&s;t a great effu&s;ion of blood, and Princes that are good, would &s;pare the liues of their Subiects, yea, of Chri&s;tian Enemies as much as may be. But to returne where we left.</P>
<P>About the 21. of Nouember, the Enemy approched Diete&s;hen with 8000. hor&s;e and foot, and foure Peeces of Ordnance, notwith&s;tanding Captaine <HI>Banbierg</HI> de&s;i&s;ted from oppo&s;ing or fighting with him, as pretending he had no &s;uch Commi&s;&s;ion, but only to &s;tay for his Excellencies comming, who was re&s;olued to encounter with him in|deed, but the Enemy taried in no place, but rather retired backe, and &s;o there was no hunting him in a depopulated Countrey. The 25. of Nouemb, his Excellency left Lan|derberg,
<PB N="12" REF="8">leauing but one Company, as a Gari&s;on therein, and marched with all his forces toward Gern&s;ham, and the next day toward Diete&s;hen, with foure Peeces of Ord|nance of 15. pound bullet, where the Enemy and he skir|mi&s;hed: for though they retired about the 22. of Nouemb. yet they &s;till houered here about, and re&s;olued vpon any aduantage or opportunity to be&s;iege the Towne, by which occa&s;ion when we found them here, we came to blowes: but their maine forces lay entrenched by a Mar&s;h, and kept the fa&s;tne&s;&s;e, &s;o that we could neither enforce them, nor fight any &s;et battaile: wherefore his Excellency loath to loo&s;e time in the euening, retired to Bern&s;hem againe, whereby the Enemy had lea&s;ure to be&s;iege Diete&s;hen, and &s;o with nine dayes battery, and the lo&s;&s;e of 200. men, he tooke it by compo&s;ition, after we (as I &s;aid) had skirmi&s;hed with them the 26. and 27. many times.</P>
<P>The 29. of Nouemb, the Burgoma&s;ter <HI>Nonnelts</HI> of Spiers was &s;ent vnto his Excellency with gratification and a&s;&s;u|rance, that they would take vp 1000. men, and giue them three moneths pay, and &s;o &s;end them well furni&s;hed to his Excellency, by which example the Townes of Landaw, Wei&s;enburch, and Hagenaw haue done the like, according to proportion of Inhabitants: but <HI>Strasbourg</HI> hath beat vp the Drums for 4000. with her Villages, who are ready to come vnto vs: &s;o that we encrea&s;e daily, and finde the Pro|te&s;tants to their power, willing to &s;upply vs with men, mo|ney, and munition; whereupon we returned to Diete&s;hen againe, and repo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the place, putting the Enemy out, and &s;o left 300. men as a Gari&s;on in the &s;ame, which was done the 12. of Decemb. we did the like to Fridel&s;hem, but that fell into the Enemies hand, as &s;oone as we departed: For you mu&s;t know, that the&s;e places are neither fortified, nor walled, but as the &s;tronger forces po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e them, and
<PB N="13" REF="8">make them &s;eruiceable to their v&s;es.</P>
<P>The 16. of December wee marched from Bern&s;hen to Hagenaw, and &s;o to Wantzenaw by Strasburch, and at la&s;t tooke El&s;az-&s;auoren without any great hurt; but mo&s;t chiefly we forraged the whole Bi&s;hoprick to the &s;upplying our wants, and enriching the Souldiers. For when <HI>Stra&s;|burg</HI> vnder&s;tood what was done, and that we were going away with the &s;poiles; they &s;ent vnto vs, and redeemed the &s;ame with the disbur&s;ing of 200000. Ricks dollers; where|by our Souldiers full of money and courage, cryed out for the Rhine, and the riuer of Maine: For we now mu&s;tered 16000. foot, and 6000. Hor&s;e, hauing hone&s;t and probable certificate, that the Bauarians and Spaniards were not 14000. and &s;o &s;tood in feare of his Excellencies comming vpon them, which no que&s;tion he would haue done, like thunder, if they would any manner of way had endured the triall, but they had learnt the tricke of entrenching, and &s;o expected the good houre of &s;upplying their Armies both from Sauoy and Italy.</P>
<P>The 6. of Ianuary Mon&s;ieur <HI>Bonni Court,</HI> a Baron of Lo|raine, came to Hagenaw to his Excellency with 600. hor&s;e and the Baron <HI>Bouo</HI> with 4000. foote, &s;o that it &s;hould &s;eeme his Excellency is much feared in Loraine: For ma|ny of his Companies haue already ta&s;ted the fruits of the Countrey, and with reciprocall gentlene&s;&s;e been welcom|med among&s;t them, yea, it is certaine, that France her &s;elfe &s;u&s;pects his approch, and the Prote&s;tants euery where pray for his &s;ucce&s;&s;e, and comming among&s;t them, becau&s;e it is rumoured, that the King of France hath taken the Sa|crament to ouer-runne them all.</P>
<P>Thus is the mu&s;tring of Souldiers, and taking vp of men on all &s;ides: for as his Excellency encrea&s;eth his Company with the inhabitants of Loraine, who willingly &s;uffer his
<PB N="14" REF="9">Mu&s;ter-ma&s;ters among them, and hath at lea&s;t 1000. &s;ub|iects of Spiers likewi&s;e to attend his &s;eruice: &s;o doe the Ba|uarians &amp; Spaniards &s;eeke daily to augment their troopes, and be&s;ides great hopes out of Italy and Sauoy, haue the helpe and a&s;&s;i&s;tants of the Catholike Bi&s;hops, Princes, Gentlemen, and Townes: &s;o that the Earle <HI>George van Low|e&s;ten</HI> hath taken vp a Regiment of foote, and 600. hor&s;e, who all lye in and about Landaw. Colonell <HI>Tilley</HI> quarte|reth with 500. men by and in Landeburg, &amp; hath his other troopes di&s;pier&s;ed in &s;euerall places: For &s;ome 14. dayes &s;ince, he tooke Wimphen, and as we heard many of Hei|delberg retired them&s;elues to Mainhem, being full of feare, that in the ab&s;ence of Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI> the Bauarians would come backe againe to Heidelberg it &s;elfe, but wee hope it is too &s;trong and well peopled for them, and they dare not as yet leaue the other places wherein they abide, naked and abandoned: be&s;ides, Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> is not re|tired &s;o farre, but he can come againe vpon them to pre|uent further mi&s;chiefe: for Captaine <HI>Cheuit</HI> lying in Diel&s;|berg about the end of December, tooke in a little Towne by the meanes of a playing Petard, and &s;lew many of the Bauarians, &s;poiling and burning the place: yet did yet be|long to our Colonell <HI>Land&s;hat,</HI> who is a natiue of that Countrey.</P>
<P>In this manner are all the&s;e Countries turmoyled, and the people in Armes, &s;o that his excellency groweth &s;tron|ger and &s;tronger, and the Palatinate is much comforted, and expecteth a faire recouery: For in Heidelberg lyeth Colonell <HI>Mer&s;en</HI> as Gouernour, and hath foure Compa|nies in his Regiment; with him is ioyned Colonell <HI>Land|&s;hat</HI> with foure Companies, and two Engli&s;h Companies, who are well appointed, and the Generall <HI>Vere</HI> is very care|full and indu&s;trious, that the Bauarians take him not at any
<PB N="15" REF="9">aduantage; whereupon Franckendale was al&s;o newly re|lieued, &s;o that there are now in it 12. Companies, be&s;ides, the Burgers and many hundreds of Pe&s;ants, who &s;erue for Pyoners, and to &s;et forward the workes: nay, they are &s;o &s;trong and cheerefull, that they &s;ent a conuoy with diuers Gentlemen, and well appointed Companies of foot to conduct the Pal&s;graue Corne &amp; Wine out of Attenbergs: Schonauer and Niewhau&s;en hoof, with other places, which belonged to his Royalties, to bring all &s;afe to Francken|dale: but they of Wormes denied vs pa&s;&s;age, and &s;hut their gates, keeping their Scon&s;es again&s;t vs, becau&s;e they pretended a treaty and capitulation with the Bauarians, and either dur&s;t not yeeld to our reque&s;ts, or were indeed di&s;affected to vs in their hearts: whereupon Generall <HI>Vere</HI> not thinking it meete to endure &s;uch neutrality, or giue way to affronts, which might di&s;parage his Honour; &s;ent vs Commi&s;&s;ion to malepri&s;e all the commodities, and Marchandize, that came from Wormes, and intercept the Wagons of all &s;orts, that pa&s;&s;ed and repa&s;&s;ed too and from them; whereby we quickly tooke 100. Fats of Wine, much Corne, Hor&s;es, and many other commodities, teaching them a better le&s;&s;on of friendline&s;&s;e and con&s;tancie: &s;o that euer &s;ince they haue agreed, and bound them&s;elues to be more &s;eruiceable, and at that time bought out their Corne and Wine againe at rea&s;onable rates, though with great lo&s;&s;e to the Marchant, who in the bargain disbur&s;ed 1000. Dollers extraordinary, which were deuided among&s;t the Souldiers, who brought them&s;elues and that they went for quietly to Franckendale.</P>
<P>After this, we grew bolder and bolder, and made diuers out-roades and in-roades into the Bi&s;hoprick of Spiers, where we obtained good booty, and faw the mi&s;ery of the&s;e places, which were preyed vpon on all &s;ides, and
<PB N="16" REF="10">made &s;ubiect to the v&s;urpation of &s;trangers, who were not dainty to di&s;robe her of her be&s;t ornaments: For as I &s;aid before euen at Franckendale it &s;elfe, we were enforced to cut downe the goodly Woods round about it, and many thou&s;and trees in other places, becau&s;e they &s;erued only as a &s;helter for the Spaniards to lye in Ambu&s;cado, and &s;o breake vpon vs vnawares; or if you will lye continually &s;hooting at vs to our great lo&s;&s;e and hinderance, without any endemnity to them&s;elues: but now God be thanked it is otherwi&s;e, though to the Countries damage and defa|cing, and we are preparing for to rai&s;e out-works, and ca&s;t rafts and trenches, which will que&s;tionle&s;&s;e put the Enemy to great lo&s;&s;e and trouble to winne, and demoli&s;h, before he can come neere our Townes: and in this e&s;tate &s;tandeth the Palatinate it &s;elfe at this houre, both our &s;elues and the Enemy well fortified in euery place, and re&s;olued, that if they come not to an orderly rendition, it will be now a matter of great difficulty, to put the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors out of their holds and fortifications, e&s;pecially if the Souldiers be well paid, and take notice of the Officers care to &s;upply their wants: For although the Countrey be much forraged, yet for money proui&s;ion will come on all &s;ides, and the ri|uers can &s;end downe their Boats and Punts from remoter places, with corne, cattell, wine, and other nece&s;&s;aries, as occa&s;ion &s;hall &s;erue.</P>
<P>While we thus bu&s;ied our &s;elues in the Palatinate, and lay watching one another to preuent the mi&s;chiefes, which might be taken vpon aduantages, his Excellency grew &s;tronger and &s;tronger, and had planted him&s;elfe as it were in a new Countrey: whereupon the &s;pirituality of Mentz, and the confines of Loraine, yea &s;ome &s;ay of Metts like|wi&s;e, de&s;ired with one con&s;ent a truce for two moneths, ei|ther expecting reliefe, which I know not from whence it
<PB N="17" REF="10">&s;hould come, or re&s;oluing to buy out their peace, which is that Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> de&s;ired, as knowing money to be the very &s;inewes of his &s;trength, and binding cords to keepe all &s;trongly together, or fearing his forces and prote&s;tations: For concerning the one, they &s;aw apparantly, that as the Scriptures &s;aid of <HI>Iehu,</HI> he came or marched furiou&s;ly: &s;o did this Champion of Honor, whirle vp and downe their Countries with violence, and added forces to forces to firme him&s;elfe the &s;tronger. Concerning the other, &s;eeing the Spaniards and Bauarians had led him the way, and taught him a le&s;&s;on of intru&s;ion, and v&s;urping another mans right; why &s;hould not he doe the like, paying them with their owne money, and prizing the ballances with their owne weights? nay, if they were &s;o ready to rob and &s;poile the Prote&s;tants in the Palatinate? why &s;hould not hee be as willing and propence to forrage the Papi&s;ts, where&s;oeuer they recided, or he could finde them. The&s;e con&s;iderations made the Bi&s;hops and other Clergy men &s;u&s;pect their e&s;tates, and re&s;olue to compound for their quietne&s;&s;e: For as I &s;aid, they &s;aw no forces ready either to oppo&s;e or expell the Mansfildians, as I may call them, nor could indeed coniecture, what would be the &s;ucce&s;&s;e of the&s;e affaires, or whether this glorious Army would march, much le&s;&s;e in what attempts it might be pro&s;pe|rous. For they &s;aw plainely the Bi&s;hoprick of Spiers was &s;poiled, and that the Towne it &s;elfe had agreed with him, and in a manner promi&s;ed, not to entertaine any Spani&s;h Cati&s;ons, though <HI>Don Cordona</HI> and Mon&s;ieur <HI>Tilley</HI> impor|tuned the &s;ame: yet for all this did the Bi&s;hop retire with certaine Cornets of Hor&s;e to Idenheim, where Mon&s;ieur <HI>Tilley</HI> was re&s;ident, and his Excellency perceiuing the Pa|pi&s;ts onely to tempori&s;e, was the vnwillinger to come to any compo&s;ition with them, but would rather aduenture
<PB N="18" REF="11">on the &s;poile: but at la&s;t his re&s;olution was to be contented with &s;o much money ready paid.</P>
<P>You haue heard before, that there was &s;ome contro|uer&s;ie betweene the Spaniards and Bauarians about points of honour, or (if you will) tumors of vaine-glory and am|bition, which now bur&s;t out againe: For about the 7. of Ianuary, while the Bauarians were re&s;olued to attempt &s;ome places: <HI>Don Cordoua</HI> again&s;t all expectation would endure the field no longer, nor hazard his Souldiers in the extremity of Winter, which now came vpon them, and &s;o retired him&s;elfe to Winter his troopes in better lodging; whereby wee had the more lea&s;ure to &s;urpri&s;e &s;uch Mar|chandize, as pa&s;&s;ed to and fro the Countrey: yea, his Ex|cellency commanded the Rhine at Germ&s;hem, and had di|uers Ships and Boats ready either to make a Bridge ouer the &s;ame, or to tran&s;port his Army and Proui&s;ion to &s;uch places, as he determined to lodge in: but he went pre|&s;ently as you heard into the Bi&s;hoprick of Mentz, and they of Strasburg gaue liberty to his Captaines to mu&s;ter men, and take vp SOuldiers in his name, though the Archduke <HI>Leopoldus</HI> had &s;ent an Amba&s;&s;adour to diuers Townes by way of countermaund and prohibition: But alas! Amba&s;|&s;ies will doe no good, where men are Ma&s;ters of the field, and Armies lye ready to pro&s;ecute any tyranny contradic|ted, or in the heat of fury and reuenge: For &s;uch was the &s;ucce&s;&s;e of Earle <HI>Mansfields</HI> affaires, that he tooke vp men in all places, and &s;o went directly to El&s;as, a Towne of great expectation: for although &s;ome two moneths be|fore he had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame, as he thought, hauing receiued &s;ome Souldiers into the Towne, whereby it was confidently giuen out, that El&s;as, or El&s;as Saueren was his owne, being a fortified place, &s;ubiect to the Archduke <HI>Leo|paldus,</HI> who is Lord of that Countrey they call <HI>Al&s;atia,</HI> ly|ing
<PB N="19" REF="11">betweene Switzerland and Mentz, arriuing by the Bi|&s;hoprick of Spiers, and the Palatinate, full of Riuers, and extraordinary commodities, and euery way conuenient for his Excellencies affaires: yet they reuolted againe, and put out all his gari&s;ons, &s;tanding firme for their owne Lord the Archduke <HI>Leopoldus:</HI> &s;o that much exa&s;perated again&s;t them, about the 17. of Ianuary, he &s;ent mo&s;t part of his Ar|my either to be&s;iege or &s;urpri&s;e it, who in the march tooke all the Bi&s;hops Booers, with their Hor&s;es and Waggons, and made good booty.</P>
<P>But before I proceed any further, you mu&s;t con&s;ider, that in all your Dutch Currantoes, this word <HI>El&s;as</HI> is taken for the whole Countrey of <HI>Leopoldus,</HI> as much as for the Towne it &s;elfe, and therefore may bring confu&s;ion to the Reader, that he &s;uppo&s;eth &s;ometimes the Country is taken, when it is but the Towne, and the Towne is taken, when he is onely marching in the Countrey. Another error ari|&s;eth from the&s;e Currantoes in confu&s;ion of time, by <HI>&s;tilo nouo,</HI> yea by many antidates, and po&s;tdates, &s;o that they place that fir&s;t, which &s;hould be la&s;t, and that la&s;t, which had a pa&s;&s;age of former time. Thirdly, that they build too much vpon heare-&s;ayes and reports, and &s;o tru&s;ting vnto various opinions, huddle all newes together, becau&s;e they would be thought to know &s;omething. La&s;t of all, your Dutch Letters haue a &s;trange cu&s;tome of partiality to &s;et out the glory, and renowne of their owne Countrey-men, and &s;carce to mention either the Engli&s;h, or any other Nation, who are indeed the be&s;t Actors in &s;uch &s;eruices: As for example, in the di&s;cription of the fiege of <HI>Fran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ken|dale,</HI> not an Engli&s;h-man in any Curranto, or Dutch Let|ter is named: but onely Captaine <HI>Ouertrant,</HI> and &s;uch like, when yet the Engli&s;h de&s;erued better then any Nation. Againe: in the gouernment of Heidelberg, onely the
<PB N="20" REF="12">Dutch Gouernour is commended, but the Engli&s;h are &s;paringly pa&s;t ouer, with naming of two Engli&s;h Compa|nies in the Towne: Nay, in the de&s;cription of Mainhem it &s;elfe, the Generall <HI>Vere</HI> is &s;lightly charactered, when yet by commi&s;&s;ion from the King of Bohemia, he is the great Commaunder of the whole Countrey; and Count <HI>Man&s;|field</HI> him&s;elfe, while he is re&s;ident there, mu&s;t acknowledge his authority. The&s;e thinges I thought good to certifie you of by way of tran&s;ition, that you bee not altogether tran&s;ported with Dutch newes, and partiality, nor con|founded with tran&s;mutation of time and names, nor af|frighted with any relation, which &s;hall &s;eeme to darken the glory of the&s;e affaires, or the hope of better &s;ucce&s;&s;e in the Palatinate bu&s;ines. But to auoyde all doubts, que&s;ti|ons and oppo&s;itions, I haue (gentle Reader) for your &s;ake compo&s;ed this di&s;cour&s;e, and in a plaine phra&s;e, that you may rely vpon one truth, and teach your hearts a &s;ong of thanke&s;giuing to the God of truth, and battailes, that hath thus begun to bring matters about, again&s;t all expectation: and &s;o to our bu&s;ine&s;&s;e againe.</P>
<P>In Lotringhem the Spaniards Commi&s;&s;aries, as well as Earle <HI>Mansfields,</HI> met to take vp men, and mu&s;ter Souldi|ers, and were very iealous one of another, who &s;hould pre|uaile in their greater numbers, how they &s;ped I cannot tell, but we were plea&s;ed in our accounts: For although diuers went to Eln&s;hi&s;em to &s;erue Duke <HI>Leopoldus,</HI> with a&s;&s;urance that more would follow: yet we made a &s;trong party, and marched forward with 16. peeces of Ordinance, &amp; leauing 300. men in Germer&s;heim, tooke our way to Lanterbergh, where wee had a great skirmi&s;h, and lo&s;t &s;ome men, not without reciprocall damage to the Enemy: but before we pa&s;&s;ed from hence, newes came of the Spaniards comming to Germer&s;heim, with re&s;olution to make a &s;hip Bridge
<PB N="21" REF="12">there, and that 600. Bauarian Souldiers were gone out vpon booty, whom we watched narrowly to catch in their returne, but we failed at this time, and were cro&s;&s;ed againe with a new report, that the Towne of Spiers had entertained 1000. Souldiers to defend the &s;ame, as &s;u&s;pec|ting we might come thither, and take them at &s;ome ad|uantage: and thus were the Catholike Bi&s;hops likewi&s;e &s;tanding on their guards, and neither went abroad without a conuoy, nor &s;lept in their Pallaces without Courts of guard; nay, the alarum went as farre as Cullein, and all places prepared to delend them&s;elues: for the Papi&s;ts per|ceiued that Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> re&s;olued to draw the warre from the Palatinate, into the Bi&s;hops Countries, and were in great feare, that the young Duke of Brun&s;wick with di|uers Lords, in the behalfe of the King of Bohemia, would make a &s;trong party on the other &s;ide of the Rhine, as well as Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> had done on this &s;ide toward Loraine, and the borders of France.</P>
<P>The 20. of Ianuary, wee tooke in the Towne and free|dome of Hagenaw, re&s;oluing to quarter our &s;elues there, and &s;o remained quiet a while, till his Excellency re&s;olued to pro&s;ecute the fiege of El&s;as Saberen more throughly, &s;uppo&s;ing that, as the Archduke <HI>Deopoldus</HI> kept there his Court of Chancery, he had al&s;o beene there in per&s;on, but the truth was, he had not long &s;ince retired him&s;elfe into the Valtolina. In briefe: after we had di&s;armed all the Souldiers that were in the Townes, we tooke, &s;poiled the lewes, and forraged the Countries, as turning our &s;elues round about without any certaine pa&s;&s;age forward, or backward. Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> &s;ent Colonell <HI>Ouertrant</HI> as Ge|nerall of this new Army, with 3000. foot, and 1000. Hor&s;e, &s;eauen peeces of Cannon, &s;ome Petards, and many Pyo|ners and Workmen, who &s;eated them&s;elues before the
<PB N="22" REF="13">Towne, making large quarters, and yet fortifying them|&s;elues after the cu&s;tome of trenched Camps: the fir&s;t thing they doe, was the &s;ummoning the place to the v&s;e of Count <HI>Mansfield;</HI> the next thing they attempted, was the threat|ning of the &s;ame, as farre as demolition, if they did not or|derly &s;urrender and compound for their quietne&s;&s;e. They of the Towne demaunded three dayes re&s;pite: they of the Campe murmured at the delay, whereupon <HI>Onertrant</HI> &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger to his Excellency to know his re&s;olution; who remembring former grieuances, and exa&s;perated for their fir&s;t reuolt, &s;ent 1000. men more with a &s;euere impo&s;ition, not to allow them three houres by way of di&s;puting, except they determined at the time prefixed to yeeld indeed: for haue it he would, what&s;oeuer it co&s;t him. In the meane while all the Bi&s;hopricks were &s;poiled, and the Papi&s;ts had not now &s;o great a cau&s;e of ioy and triumph, as at the be|ginning their o&s;tentation &s;hewed.</P>
<P>So that I will be bolde to &s;ay, neuer was &s;uch an alterati|on: For though Prague is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Emperour, who hath wracked his rage vpon &s;uch he named Traytors, and the Palatinate is thus &s;orraged by the Bauarians and our Souldiers. Yet marke what followed, euen in a man|ner the deua&s;tation of all Germany, and the Papi&s;ts euery where are &s;et vpon by the Prote&s;tants, &amp; our Enemies op|po&s;ed with as great Armies and forces: For how the Duke of Saxony is turmoiled in Sile&s;ia, and his owne Countrey is apparant, &s;o that in my con&s;cience he wi&s;heth an end of the Warre. The Hungarians forrage euen Sile&s;ia it &s;elfe, and &s;pare none, who haue beene oppo&s;ite to the King of Bohemia. <HI>Bethelem Gabor</HI> takes it ill, that the Emperour will rai&s;e Souldiers out of Poland to di&s;turbe his friends, and &s;o procured the Turke to &s;end a Chau&s;e vnto him, to certifie his plea&s;ure of mi&s;liking the &s;ame; and withall

<P>While the&s;e things haue their &s;euerall pa&s;&s;ages in the remoter places, Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> pro&s;ecuteth his determi|nation again&s;t El&s;as Saueren, and the whole Countrey of the Archduke <HI>Leopaldus,</HI> &s;o that diuers Swi&s;s haue offered him their &s;eruice, and the Archduke is much mole&s;ted to &s;ee &s;uch a fire rai&s;ed again&s;t him: whereupon by the Bi|&s;hop of Strasburgs inticement, he &s;ent three per&s;ons of re|putation by the way of an Amba&s;&s;ie, that if he would leaue the Dioce&s;&s;e of Strasburg, and his Countrey vnmole&s;ted, he would re&s;tore the Veltolina againe, and make a perfect

Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> replied, he mu&s;t haue other compo&s;ition, ere he de&s;i&s;ted what was his owne, or knew he could make his owne, he would keepe vntill the Palatinate were re&s;tored, and the Bauarians and Spaniards departed, he would either diuert the Warre to other places, or enrich his Army out of other mens pur&s;es: as for the name of peace, it had an ill accent in the&s;e times, confidering their owne examples: For what did he any more then was taught him, and could he doe le&s;&s;e, then &s;et on foot &s;ome reuenge. If the Spaniards and Bauarians vn|der the colour of the Emperours &s;eruice, had &s;et vpon the Palatinate, and Prote&s;tants there, the auncient inheritance of a religious Prince, and Elector of the Empire: why might not he for the &s;eruice of the King of Bohemia i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> other Countries, who were irreligious Papi&s;ts, and held tho&s;e Diabolicall po&s;itions of murthering, and depo&s;ing of Princes.</P>
<P>This an&s;wer was much di&s;plea&s;ing to <HI>Leopoldus,</HI> but he &s;aw no remedy. For to adde vnto his di&s;contentment, the Switzers re&s;olued not to admit of his gouernment, and &s;o &s;ent word to the Duke of Millane of the &s;ame, who could doe nothing without the King of Spaines re&s;olutions: but they would not tarry his an&s;wer, but &s;ought all the meanes they could to free them&s;elues, and a&s;&s;i&s;t the Grizons for the recouery of the Valtolina againe: whereupon they certi|fied Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> of all their affaires, who re&s;olued to follow <HI>Leopoldus</HI> whether &s;oeuer he went, and to pre&s;&s;e him to make an end of the Warre, and that intru&s;ion.</P>
<P>In the meane while, the Towne of El&s;as is now befieged, and the three dayes they demaunded, expired, &s;o they re|&s;o lued to fight it out, and &s;ent word to the Ca&s;tle of He genbart, &s;tanding vpon a very high rock, to annoy the Ar|my as they could, which they did night and day: For the
<PB N="25" REF="15">Mansfildians lay within &s;hot, and the Towne thought vp|on nothing but re&s;cue: but neither did the Artillery doe any great harme to the Army, nor could <HI>Leopoldus</HI> preuent the mi&s;chiefe which followed: For about the 27. of Ianua|ry, the Army gaue a braue affault vpon the Towne, and with diuers batteries, and the lo&s;&s;e of 400. men, with two principall Captaines, they tooke the &s;ame, as al&s;o Mours Men&s;ter, where were &s;laine 300: but in both they found &s;ufficient riches, with 300. Tunne of Wine, and many thou&s;and mea&s;ures of Corne, but neither &s;poile, not rapes were committed: For vpon &s;mall payments their hou&s;es &s;tood with their Hou&s;hold-&s;tuffe and Vten&s;els vn&s;tirred, and none were ran&s;ommed, but the hone&s;t Papi&s;ts: For the Abbot and diuers others, were faine to flye, and di&s;pierce them&s;elues into Lotteringhen, and &s;undry places of &s;ecu|rity: yet could not preuent great disbur&s;ements of mony, nor in a manner ran&s;omming them&s;elues: For the Mark|graue of Tourlack tooke his Excellencies part, and got ma|ny people and Souldiers to be retained in his Excellencies Army, which was mu&s;tred anew, and &s;o he marched backe againe toward Loraine with all the Peeces, which he had at Hagenaw, who were faine to di&s;bur&s;e 10000. ricks dol|lers, to buy out their peace; yea, the Duke of Lottinghem him&s;elfe came to a compo&s;ition of 100000. ricks dollers, that he would paffe quietly without forraging his domini|ons, which order he ob&s;erueth with all the places, that doe quietly &s;urrender; as for tho&s;e that oppo&s;e again&s;t him, ei|ther Village or Towne he leaueth to the &s;poile of the Soul|dier, and when they haue no &s;poile, he payeth them out of his trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>Now you mu&s;t con&s;ider, that how euer El&s;as Saueren was taken, yet there was a compo&s;ition made, and condi|tions of agreement ratified betweene them for the pay|ment
<PB N="26" REF="16">of 300000. Ricks dollers, which were demanded the fir&s;t of February, and for want of disbur&s;ing, much vnkind|ne&s;&s;e and threatning followed: yet had they fine dayes lon|ger re&s;pite: in which interim Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> retiring him&s;elfe to Hagenaw, gaue the Army leaue to vi&s;ite the Countrey, and &s;uch places where they might imagine any booty was to be gotten, or Enemy to be met withall: and &s;o about the third of February 9. Cornets of Horfe pa&s;&s;ed Strasburag Bridge to intercept the Bauarians, who were gone vpon &s;ome de&s;igne to Swatwood: And vpon the fourth of-February many Companies went out another way, and burned foure of the Bi&s;hops Villages, watching the Markets, and taking many Bauarians pri&s;oners, who lye vpon the Countrey; as well as them&s;elues, and take one another at aduantage, as opportunity feiues their turnes. The fift of February the &s;peech was, that the whole Army would ri&s;e and march forward to Hem&s;es Heim, Brifac, and Friburg: but hearing that the Bauarians were going to new lodging, they de&s;i&s;ted for that time, and did not meane to &s;tirre, till they were a&s;&s;ured where the Enemy would di&s;po&s;e of him&s;elfe.</P>
<P>While the&s;e things were &s;howne on the Stage of Varie|ty, and all Chri&s;tiandome &s;tood looking on to behold, what &s;cenes the&s;e &s;eruants of Bellona would act: Letters both of gratification and direction came from the King of Denmark, and all that fauoured the cau&s;e of the Palatinate, wherein he had particular intelligence, that the Prote&s;tant Princes were re&s;olued vpo~ an Army of their own, that is to &s;ay, to be paid at their owne charges, vnder the commaund of the Earle of Tourlach, and to that purpo&s;e <HI>Murterbergh</HI> taketh vp 3000. Foot, and 500. Hor&s;e: the Barrons <HI>Me&s;&s;airs de Bounoies,</HI> and <HI>Frandecount,</HI> two Regiments, the <HI>Marc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">graue</HI> of Baden, and Duke <HI>Weymaren</HI> 3000. Foot, and 500. Hor&s;e,
<PB N="27" REF="16">Duke <HI>Magnus</HI> 1000. foot, and 400. hor&s;e, <HI>Hem&s;teder</HI> 3000 foot, the <HI>Rheien Graf Oue</HI> 500. hor&s;e, <HI>Flecken&s;teine</HI> 600. hor&s;e, and <HI>Gol&s;tein</HI> 3000. foot, and 400. hor&s;e: all which with di|uers others &s;hall march vnder the &s;tandard of the Princes of the Vnion: For although they vnder&s;tand of great pre|parations from Sauoy, Naples, Millaine, Spaine, Poland, Au&s;tria, and the Princes combined vnto the Emperour and his &s;eruice: yet they are a&s;&s;ured that the Switzers haue leagued them&s;elues, both Prote&s;tants and Papi&s;ts to ca&s;t off the yoke of the Spani&s;h gouernment, and to moue in their owne free Orbes, as they did before: yea, <HI>Leopald<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> him|&s;elfe doth much repine at the Spaniards intru&s;ion into the Valtolina, or any territories of the Grizons for the go|uernment, did euer belong vnto a younger hou&s;e of Au|&s;tria, and one of the Archdukes in former times lo&s;t his life about the &s;ame, and with much adoe it was obtained.</P>
<P>And thus much of Earle <HI>Mansfields</HI> proceedings, to the 12. of February la&s;t, who&s;e comming downe into the Pa|latinate, be&s;ides the running away &s;o fortunately with his owne actions, hath made the pa&s;&s;age the ca&s;ier for Gene|rall <HI>Veres</HI> care and diligence to fortifie &s;uch principall pla|ces, as lay open before to the daring approches of a &s;trong Enemy, and the fearefull batteries of a Cannon, or other &s;tratagems of Warre: but now Heidelberg with many other Townes are well fortified, the pa&s;&s;ages haue Scon|&s;es: the confines are garri&s;ond, the riuers haue Bridges, which they can take away at their plea&s;ure, and the very Boores, though labouring like Pyoners, returne to their Villages with the reputation of a Souldier: &s;o that in my con&s;cience, if <HI>Spinola</HI> him&s;elfe were now to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion into this Countrey, he would finde it more difficult, then he did, and who&s;oeuer may conceit by the &s;ame argu|ment, that therefore the Bauarian and Spaniard, being
<PB N="28" REF="17">now fortified, will hardly be compul&s;ed out without ren|dition, or compo&s;ition. I an&s;wer plainely, I thinke &s;o to: For &s;o I am a&s;&s;ured the behalfe of the Bauarians, that they will hardly get any further places of account, then they haue: but if the Warre be diuerted to other Countries, as you &s;aw, how the Romanes dealt with <HI>Anniball,</HI> to draw him to defend Carthage, that had been 17. yeares in Italy, and could not be &s;tartled from thence by force, or pollicy, then it may be the&s;e intruders will be glad to goe home againe to keepe their Countrey from the cruell Armes of deua&s;tation: or if &s;ome thundring troopes come vpon them, with a well di&s;ciplined and gouerned Army, then may the &s;tronger arme put out the &s;trong man.</P>
<P>As for their obiection, that would commend the piety of the Enemy, in not ouer-running the Countrey at his fir&s;t entrance into it. What hath hee done better then Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> hath done in many Countries? but I will an&s;wer more particularly; peraduenture he could not, af|ter the Noble <HI>Vere</HI> came to intercept his forwardnes: per|aduenture he was willing to ta&s;te of the Grapes and fruits many dayes, and then it had beene folly to haue made an vntimely Vintage, and deuoured all in one day. Perad|uenture he was loath to goe too farre, for loo&s;ing him&s;elfe in a Wood, or hazard his returne when he would, if &s;uch came behind him, as would make him leape ouer their Pikes, or peraduenture he had limitation, lea&s;t by prouing too cruell, he might &s;top vp the gap of all piety and com|mi&s;eration, if euer the wheele of Fortune would turne a|bout, and leaue the triumpher him&s;elfe in the hands of compa&s;&s;ion, as in all ages and chances of Warre hath hap|pened, where many a time the Sonne hath beene &s;tabbed for his Fathers cruelty, &amp; the Generall reconciled, by find|a noble aduer&s;ary. But here me thinks I am an&s;wered with
<PB N="29" REF="17">peremptorine&s;&s;e, that the&s;e Countries haue &s;uch mighty aduer&s;aries, that there is no po&s;&s;ibility of extenuating their greatne&s;&s;e, much le&s;&s;e of bringing them to the barre of a new examination.</P>
<P>Be not too pre&s;umptuous, nor runne away &s;o fa&s;t with ouer-confidence of any worldly &s;tability: remember rather what <HI>Mordecay</HI> &s;aid to <HI>He&s;ter:</HI> That if &s;he did not goe in to the King for the pre&s;eruation of her people, God would rai&s;e &s;ome help another way to bring his purpo&s;es to pa&s;&s;e: &s;o &s;ay I of the Palatinate, when we runne away with an opinion of inuincible Armados, and for euitable Armies: the windes and weather may di&s;cipate the one, and very weake oppo&s;ition, ouerthrow the other. For the God of windes and battailes, hath a trick to humble vs with hard beginnings at the fir&s;t; that pro&s;perity may be the better welcome, when it is hammered out (as it were) on the Anuill of toile, trauaile, wants, di&s;grace, contempt, and other fearefull endurances.</P>
