<P>Concerning the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> treatie of peace, wee haue yet no other tidings, but that there is come a <HI>Turki&s;h Chiany</HI> (being accompanied with few per&s;ons) to the Imperiall Commi&s;&s;ioners, to &s;alute and receiue them: and that he hath pro|pounded &s;ome few Articles, which the Empe|rour is not to admit in any manner of wayes, although the <HI>Grand Signieur</HI> would moderate them.</P>
<P>They write from <HI>Raba,</HI> that they &s;tand there in feare that the <HI>Turkes</HI> will come and pillage the Countrie there about, and that they keepe &s;trong watches, and have planted their Ord|nance vpon their walles and bulwarkes, to &s;a|lute them at their arriuall: as likewi&s;e how that there being a hou&s;e fired by ca&s;ualtie, the In|habitants and Souldiers which are in <HI>Commora</HI> were mightilie afraid, and &s;u&s;pected that it had beene done by the <HI>Turkes</HI> to &s;urpri&s;e the place the better.</P>
<P>In the beginning of this Moneth was a Pro|clamation at <HI>Linty</HI> in the vpper <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> procla|med in the name of the Emperour, to cite all &s;uch as haue beene guiltie in the former Rebel|lion, to appeare within the &s;pace of &s;ixe weekes and three daies in the head Towne of <HI>Linty,</HI> be|fore the Emperiall Pre&s;ident and Coun&s;ell Namelie, the Count of <HI>Neggaw,</HI> Gouernour of the lower <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> the Lord of <HI>Hoyes</HI> Pre&s;edent of the Coun&s;ell of the lower <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> the Lord of <HI>Reck,</HI> one of his Maie&s;ties Imperiall Coun&s;ell,

But the Preachers are authors of the Rebellion (as they write thence) are &s;ome 8. dayes agoe di&s;mi&s;t of their charge, and commanded to depart within the &s;pace of 8. daies, which expired ye&s;terday: At the &s;ame time was not onely the preaching forbidden to the Mini&s;ters, but al&s;o the ringing and &s;ounding of Belles to the Sextons, vpon paine of death.</P>
<P>On the 15. of this Moneth were the Booke-&s;ellers Shops viewed in this Citie, and the &s;el|ling of Prote&s;tant Bookes forbidden. On the &s;ame day arriued here the Count <HI>Nicolas Wolsky</HI> Great Mar&s;chall of the Kingdome of <HI>Polonia,</HI> and it is rumored that he is to goe thence into the <HI>Low-Countries</HI> to the <HI>Infanta,</HI> which lieth at <HI>Bru&s;&s;ell.</HI></P>
<P>Two daies agoe perri&s;hed two Barkes in the Riuer of <HI>Donaw,</HI> that were &s;ailing with Corne to the frontier Townes and Ca&s;tles of <HI>Hungarie.</HI></P>
<P>The tidings which wee had heare lately, how that Mon&s;ieur <HI>Tilly</HI> had taken the bridge of <HI>Strasbourg</HI> is fal&s;e, but it is &s;ure that he hath &s;topt the pa&s;&s;ages of the <HI>Rhyne,</HI> that nothing can come vp or downe without his leaue.</P>

<P>The 19. of this Moneth departed the great Mar&s;chall of <HI>Pelonia</HI> hence, and went as it is ru|mored towards <HI>Florence.</HI></P>
<P>On the &s;ame day came his Imperiall Maie&s;tie here backe againe from <HI>Eber&s;doof,</HI> and gaue on
<PB N="4" REF="4">the next Sunday after he had heard the Ma&s;&s;e audience to the Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>Bethlem Gabor;</HI> he did the like on the following Munday to the Amba&s;&s;ador of the Elector of <HI>Cullen,</HI> and graun|ted on the next Tue&s;day the Regalia and Fulde to the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Abbot of <HI>Fulden,</HI> which demanded them in his name. On the next Wen&s;day, as likewi&s;e ye&s;terday went the Em|perour abroade to hunt the wilde Bore.</P>
<P>Fewe dayes agoe arriued here the Arch-bi|&s;hop of <HI>Pragne</HI> comming here po&s;te, and it is ru|mored that the <HI>Land-graue Charles</HI> of <HI>Lichten|&s;tayn</HI> is likewi&s;e to come hitherwards with great &s;peede.</P>
<P>The Count <HI>Serin Banus</HI> of <HI>Croatia,</HI> who came here likewi&s;e fewe dayes agoe, reporteth that he hath not onelie &s;laine many <HI>Turkes,</HI> which were pillaging the &s;ame Country, but that he al&s;o him&s;elfe hath made an inroade on the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Dominion, and gotten there rich booties. The <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> treatie of Peace is not begunne as yet, by rea&s;on that the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners are not come together, and e&s;pecially &s;eing that the chiefe&s;t of them all is yet at <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI></P>
<P>They write from <HI>Prague,</HI> that there are put in pri&s;on three men of them which robbed the Duke of <HI>Saxon Lawenborg</HI> when he was riding towards this Citie of <HI>Vienna.</HI></P>
<P>This weeke was a Po&s;tillion or Me&s;&s;enger &s;laine, when he had taken the 9. po&s;t hor&s;e be|twixt <HI>Prague</HI> and <HI>Vienna,</HI> the lttters being found by a husband man, he carried them to the next
<PB N="5" REF="4">po&s;t, but wee cannot learne as yet in what. man|ner this happenned, nor who was the author.</P>
<P>We vnder&s;tand by Letters written from <HI>Lin|ty,</HI> that the Prote&s;tant States of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> haue promi&s;ed to pay the wages to the prote&s;tant Preachers which are bani&s;hed, for two yeares, and that they gaue to euerie one of them 1000. Rix-Dollers before their departure, and that moreouer the Prote&s;tant Burgurs gaue them when they tooke their leaue of them 1.2. yea. 3. Rix-Dollers, and &s;ome of the richer &s;orts whole hand fulls of Rix-Dollers, and Duckets.</P>
<P>They write out of <HI>Hungaria,</HI> that the Lord <HI>Bo&s;niach</HI> hath &s;urpri&s;ed the &s;mall Towne of <HI>Waith,</HI> which was in the bounds fo the <HI>Tu ke,</HI> and hauing &s;laine there 2000. <HI>Turkes,</HI> tooke moreouer 70. of them as pri&s;oners, &amp; got there 970. <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> hor&s;e, be&s;ides many other rich bo|ties: Hee re&s;cued likewi&s;e all tho&s;e Chri&s;tians which the <HI>Turkes,</HI> as we mentioned heretofore had taken at <HI>Ferrels.</HI></P>
<P>The Lord <HI>E&s;terha&s;i</HI> who is Gouernor rf <HI>New|hen&s;ed,</HI> hauing &s;inck fortified <HI>Ferrele,</HI> the <HI>Grand Signiour</HI> hath &s;ent him word, that he &s;hould di&s;|mantle the place againe, &s;eing it was again&s;t the treatie of Peace, to make any new fortifications vpon the frontiers. But he the Lord <HI>E&s;terha&s;i</HI> re|turned this an&s;were, namely, that &s;eing he had &s;uffered his co&s;in, and diuers other Chri&s;tians to be taken thence as pri&s;oners, after his <HI>Truki&s;h</HI> Souldiers had pillaged the place, which was di|rectlie again&s;t the treatie of Peace, he had forti|fied
<PB N="6" REF="5">the fame place, that the Chri&s;tians might liue there &s;ecurle, and out of danger to be &s;urpri|&s;ed at the plea&s;ure of the <HI>Turkes.</HI></P>

<P>The Amba&s;&s;adors of <HI>Bethlem Gabor</HI> are not as yet di&s;pacht, nor haue vnder&s;tood the Empe|rours re&s;olution vpon their propo&s;itions which they haue made in the name of <HI>Bethlem Gabor.</HI> In the meane time they are dayly fea&s;ted by &s;eue|rall Lords, and among&s;t others the Count of <HI>Meggaw</HI> fea&s;ted them fewe daies agoe in great Pompe and State, not &s;paring any co&s;t vpon Players and Mu&s;itians. It is thought that for this time (&s;eing they brought &s;ome pre&s;ents to the Emperor) that they &s;hall likewi&s;e be &s;ent home with &s;ome pre&s;ents.</P>
<P>There is yet &s;mall likelihood of the treatie of peace, &s;eing that the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of <HI>O&s;sen</HI> hath decla|red him&s;elte, that hee will not &s;uffer the Lord <HI>Curty</HI> the Amba&s;&s;ador of his Imperiall Maie&s;tie, to goe thence before the Peace be concluded.

<P>Although the Emperour hath now many times giuen order, that the &s;ouldiers &s;hould be &s;ent out of this Kingdome into the Empire, they will not obey his order: by rea&s;on of their want of payment which they expect from the Empeour, and if they continue heere any longer, we are likely to haue a generall dearth in this Kingdome; for they haue already in many places of this Kingdome con&s;u|med the Victualls.</P>
<P>One who came lately from <HI>Olmits</HI> in <HI>Morauia</HI> brought heere tiding, how that the mo&s;t part of the Co&s;&s;acks which haue layne in <HI>Sele&s;ia,</HI> and <HI>Mo|rauia,</HI> (when they were in the pay of the Emperor) are now entered into the &s;eruice of <HI>Bethlem Gabor;</HI> and many are therefore of opinion that he (<HI>Bethlem Gabor</HI>) is not to be tru&s;ted.</P>
<P>The Elector of <HI>Saxony</HI> is with 500 hor&s;e gone to <HI>Berlin</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t there at the Chri&s;tning of a child of the Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh.</HI> But there are &s;ome which hold that they are to treat there more|ouer of &s;ome matters of great importance.</P>

<P>The tyding is confirmed againe out of <HI>Spaine</HI> how that the Generall <HI>le Hermite</HI> hath taken and pillaged the Towne of <HI>Lima,</HI> and gotten there rich booties. And they write likewi&s;e thence that there is no hope that the &s;iluer fleet &s;hall this yeare come out of the We&s;t-Indies, and that the King of <HI>Spaine</HI> his Factors can therefore hardly take any money vp for the &s;eruice of his Maie&s;ty.</P>
<P>Moreouer they adui&s;e vs thence that the fleete which is to be &s;ent again&s;t the <HI>Hollanders</HI> to reco|uer the <HI>Bay</HI> of <HI>Todos los Sanctos</HI> out of their hands, cannot &s;oone be made ready for want of money, &s;hips, munition, and men, although there walke dayly many Spani&s;h Signiors by the &s;teetes, with their feathers vpon their Hats, and threaten the <HI>Hollanders</HI> mightily.</P>

<P>But as yet heere was not a period of their power nor an end of their conque&s;t, for they proceded in the acquiring of a farther victory, laying &s;iedge to the Towne of <HI>Vima:</HI> where having encamped, they &s;ent &s;ome &s;hot to the Towne, as an Amba&s;&s;ador to tell them thundring in their eares, the &s;cope of their approach, notwith&s;tanding the Towne made &s;ome &s;mall re&s;i&s;tance; but to &s;mall purpo&s;e: for it did but procra&s;tinate, not mittigate their mi&s;ery, in fine it was taken, from whence they carryed 5 peices of Ordinance, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of which they went on yet further, and they be&s;iedged the towne of <HI>Lunnen,</HI> and that not without as hapy &s;ucce&s;&s;e, as they had formerly done the other: for haueing di&s;charged &s;ome Cannons vpon it, the towne not very well likeing of &s;uch language as the Cannon noy&s;e, nor approouing of &s;uch me&s;&s;engers as dead|ly bullots, &s;ubmitted them&s;elues vnto them, and yeeld their per&s;ons and their pur&s;es, their goods &amp; them&s;elues into their hands, which being accom|pli&s;ht with without further delay (which allures great danger in martiall matters) they po&s;ted let|ters to <HI>Emerick,</HI> the contents of which were to this effect <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>That they would &s;end them more ayde to the intent they might &s;coure away the &s;paniards which like ru&s;t hung about the countrys, and con&s;trayne them to flye out of that corner.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="9">
<P>I doubt not but this will be a <HI>Habeas corpus</HI> for <HI>Spinola,</HI> from the &s;iedge of <HI>Breda:</HI> for me thinks it &s;tands with rea&s;on that when he &s;ees his owne hou&s;e on fire, he &s;hould looke to the quenching of that rather then fircing of others, he &s;ees a certainty of lo&s;&s;e in the parting with tho&s;e Townes, but as yet no a&s;&s;urance of gayne in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of others, for hee hath not as yet attained it.</P>
<P>But to returne to our former di&s;cour&s;e, Fame which is more &s;wift then <HI>Pega&s;us,</HI> certifieth the Spani&s;h Commanders, which lyeth in the Town of <HI>We&s;ell</HI> of the&s;e proceeedings who immediatly, &s;elected of their and the other adioyning Garri&s;on of <HI>Sterelen, Gelder, Rhyneberg,</HI> and marched after|wards with them vp into the Land of <HI>Marke,</HI> tak|ing with them, certaine number of peices of ordi|nance: with an intent to make re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the afore mentioned Captaine <HI>Quait,</HI> and to en|ter into battaile with him.</P>
<P>But on the contrary &s;ide the States of the Vni|ted Prouinces, together with the Coun&s;aile of Marquis <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> &s;ent multituds of &s;ouldi|ers to defend and mayntaine the Townes which were &s;urpri&s;ed by them.</P>
<P>Of late there arriued in our Campe eight companyes of <HI>Freizland,</HI> each of them being &s;ome 150 men &s;trong: and they had a further expectati|on of other 8 companies which were coming out of the Bi&s;hoppricke, and the Land of <HI>Greuinger.</HI></P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> hauing receiued intelli|gence of Count <HI>Man&s;fields</HI> approach to <HI>Seuern|bergen</HI> &s;ent his owne Coach accompaned with
<PB N="15" REF="9">foure others, 30 waggons, 2 Troopes of hor&s;e to feth him in pompe, with no le&s;&s;e honour then magnificence.</P>
<P>On the 4 day o this month the Count of <HI>Stirum,</HI> and the Count of <HI>Hellaine,</HI> being departed out of our Campe, and intending their cour&s;e to <HI>Bergen vp Zoome,</HI> in the interim Count <HI>Man&s;fild</HI> ioyd our campe with his arriuall, hauing in his Society, the as good as old Count of <HI>Thinna</HI> the Count <HI>Ernest</HI> of <HI>Na&s;saw,</HI> with many other Lordes, Commanders, and Genelemen, who rod abroad to meete, &s;alute, and congratulate his comming in the name of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> who receiued him with Pompe and State, bee|&s;eeming the wellcome of &s;uch a noble, vertuous, and vallient, per&s;onage.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> likewi&s;e made no long &s;tay after them, but being accompaned with ma|ny Earles, Barrons, and Nobles, very Princely, and Nobley &s;hewed him much countenance, and Entertayned him with much curte&s;ie: long may they bee &s;o hounoured, which haue &s;o nobly fought it.</P>
<P>Our Camp is very fortunately, and daily en|richt, with multitudes of Pri&s;oners, and prizes, taken from the Enemies: to the no le&s;&s;e aug|mentation of our ioy, then the demunition of
<PB N="16" REF="10">their &s;olace; for as meat doth feed the body, &s;o mony doth fle&s;h and incourage the heart: but the mo&s;t memorable booty that ble&s;t our Camp, was Lieutenant <HI>Roland Vanos,</HI> who was a Captaine of the company of their enemies foot, who was taken with &s;eauen hor&s;es, and three mules, laden with Truncks of a great Spani&s;h Commanders, was carryed into <HI>Bergen vp Zoom</HI> where as yet he lyeth in the Towne.</P>
<P>All the Trenches, Ditches, Batteryes, and Fortifications, in our Camp, are now fully fini|&s;hed, and ab&s;olutly compleat.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Orang</HI> likewi&s;e, hath recalled his &s;auegards, granted to the villages, &s;cituated in the <HI>Kempen:</HI> and hath al&s;o giuen very &s;trickt and &s;treight probition in Proclamations, or fixed Bills at <HI>Bergen vp Zoom, Seuernbergen,</HI> and other adioyning places: that they &s;hall neither make &s;ale, or carryage of any kind of Grayne to the Camp.</P>
<P>Through which meanes the dearth and fa|mine in the Spani&s;h Camp doth daily encrea&s;e; for a pound of Butter is vallued, and &s;old there for ten and twelue Stiuers, a pound of Chee&s;e
<PB N="17" REF="10">is at the &s;ame price, and a quart of Beere for eight pence.</P>
<P>Moreouer they haue as little &s;tore of money, as of meate &s;tirring in their Army, in &s;o much that men in generall haue conceiued a hope, and are &s;trongly opinionated that Marquis <HI>Spinoloa</HI> hath more will then power to continue the &s;iedge of <HI>Breda;</HI> and it is thought that if not the Warres and &s;poyle done in other places, yet the hunger at home in his owne Campe, will force him to for&s;ake the &s;iedge, for if hee hath not money to get meate, nor meate to &s;tay his Souldiers &s;to|mackes, it is ea&s;ie to bee coniectured that they will follow their appetites; and if hee leaue not the &s;iedge, his Companies will for&s;ake him; <HI>Et &s;ic famem non famam habent,</HI> they haue more hunger then honour, and report hath given vs to vnder&s;tand, that they haue &s;tomackes like Lyons, but it is <HI>Magis ad pa&s;&s;endum quam pugnandum,</HI> ra|ther to feede then to fight, but to leaue the &s;iedge and to come to the be&s;idged.</P>
<P>This weeke were fiue Souldiers which made an e&s;cape by night out of <HI>Breda,</HI> by who&s;e re|lation wee vnder&s;tood that the Towne is as yet rea&s;onable well prouided for victualls, and &s;uffici|ently furni&s;hed with other &s;u&s;tinance and nece&s;&s;a|ries, for it is their a&s;&s;ertion that how&s;oeuer they bee de&s;titute, and haue want of Butter, yet
<PB N="18" REF="11">they are fully furni&s;hed with Corne, and haue great &s;tore of Cattle, aboundance of &s;alt, bread, Chee&s;e, Honey, Oyle, Syrrop, and other pro|ui&s;ion requi&s;ite for the &s;u&s;tenance and maynte|nance of this our weake and frayle life: And wee learne by particular Letters &s;ent <HI>Breda,</HI> that &s;ome three weekes &s;ince, there beeing a &s;uruey made of the &s;u&s;tenance, and proui&s;ion in the Towne, they found and vnder&s;tood that there was yet remay|ning 40000. quarters of Corne vn&s;pent or vn|toucht, which doth &s;till adde to the former ex|pectation of <HI>Spinolaes</HI> relinquiching the &s;iedge, for if the Towne bee &s;o well furni&s;hed with men, meate, and munition, it is probable that <HI>Spinola</HI> being &s;o defectiue in pur&s;e and proui&s;ion doth but <HI>littus arare,</HI> as they &s;ay, or <HI>Aethiopem lauare,</HI> la|bour in vaine, as the &s;owing on the &s;hore, or the wa&s;hing of a Blackamore; but to leaue this to the cen&s;ure of &s;ound iudgements, I proceede in my di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Count Henry</HI> of <HI>Na&s;&s;aw</HI> hath lately likewi&s;e fully fini&s;hed all his Quarters, with all the workes appertayning and belonging to them: Hee hath al&s;o prouided, and taken order that none of our victualls or any other of our adherents &s;hall tran&s;|port or carry any &s;u&s;tinance to any of our enemies or foes forces.</P>
<P>Count <HI>Man&s;field</HI> and the old Count of <HI>Thieru</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="11">hauing had long conference, and large con&s;ul|tation with his Excellence, the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> tooke their leaue and farewell of him, who as fame tells vs, are after the expiration of a &s;mall time, are to meete the Engli&s;h at the places by them appoynted, although from vs concealed, and heere of late haue beene great &s;ummes of money gathered, and &s;ent ouer into the&s;e prouin|ces out of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Neither is it buryed in concealement, that the <HI>French</HI> King hath receiued into his pay 2800 Hor&s;e, the which haue formerly &s;erued <HI>Moun&s;ier Tilly,</HI> who became humble and carne&s;t &s;uitors to &s;erue vnder Count <HI>Man&s;field,</HI> and there are yet expected 1000 Hor&s;e more which will come to offer their &s;eruice very &s;peedely, and to enter into the pay of the King of <HI>France,</HI> who is &s;till encrea&s;ing his Forces, who&s;e power as it is not yet in the full, &s;o yet it is not in the Wayne: For euery day there bee more addi|tions to it.</P>
<P>We haue likewi&s;e intelligence, and vnder&s;tand further more by letters, that the Con&s;table <HI>Lon|guiare</HI> hath with no le&s;&s;e &s;peed then &s;ucce&s;&s;e ariued among&s;t the Gri&s;ons, for he is not onely already there, but he hath &s;ubiected to the yoake of his o|bedience many places and pa&s;&s;ages, the which hee
<PB N="20" REF="12">hath effected, wrought and brought to pa&s;&s;e, as well by his owne proper forces as by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Duke of Sauoy, moreouer the French king hath &s;ent ouer al&s;o three regiments to ayde him.</P>
