<HEAD>An Epi&s;tle to a Member of Parliament, con|cerning Mr. <HI>George Oldner</HI>'s Invention to Pre|&s;erve Ships from Foundering or Sinking at Sea, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN Obedience to your Commands, I have made it my Bu&s;ine&s;s to Search out for mo&s;t of the New Pamphlets that have been Publi&s;h't, &s;ince I had the Happine&s;s of your Conver&s;ation, at your Hou&s;e in the Countrey. 'Tis true, we live in a very Teeming Age: Never was the Pre&s;s more guilty of Impertinent Productions, than &s;ince the Expi|ration of the Act of Licen&s;ing: The whole Nation &s;eems to have run a Gadding, and every little Trifler &s;ets up now for Wit, Politicks, or Projects. But among&s;t all that have ap|pear'd openly, none &s;eems to be more endu'd with &s;uch a Mon|&s;trous and Unaccountable Air of Whim&s;ie and Confidence, as the Invention of Mr. <HI>George Oldner,</HI> to pre&s;erve Ships from Foun|dering and Sinking at Sea, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> A noble Undertaking, I con|fe&s;s, if it can ever be Accompli&s;hed: But by the Method of his Propo&s;als, which I have &s;ent you, it may ju&s;tly be &s;u&s;pected to &s;avour both of De&s;ign and Vanity. For he mu&s;t certainly have a very mean Opinion of Mankind, to &s;uppo&s;e they can be prevail'd upon to Join in his Sub&s;criptions, upon &s;o &s;lender a Foundation, as an Experiment of his Invention made in a Model of Six Foot long, in the River, upon the Te&s;timony of Half a Score Hone&s;t Gentlemen, &s;ome of whom, po&s;&s;ibly, are not equal Judges; and one of the mo&s;t Honourable of them, by his own Marginal Acknowledgment, was not pre&s;ent at the Trial. For, what Proportion is there, I be&s;eech you, betwixt
<PB REF="3">a Ship of Three or Four Hundred Tun, and his Diminitive Mo|del? Or betwixt the <HI>Thames</HI> and the Main <HI>Ocean?</HI> Can there be any po&s;&s;ible Compari&s;on between the Effects of his little Model, and tho&s;e of a Loaden Ship of a Thou&s;and Tun in Tempe&s;tuous Weather? Be&s;ides, that there is a Wonderful dif|ference in the Effects of Water near the Surface, and Deeper down. But becau&s;e I wou'd not exceed the Dimen&s;ions of a familiar Letter, I &s;hall only take notice of &s;ome few Ob&s;ervati|ons that occurr'd in the reading his Propo&s;al, and &s;o leave it to your more mature Con&s;ideration, whether it may de&s;erve any Encouragement from the Hou&s;e, if ever it &s;hall have the Con|fidence to appear in Parliament.</P>
<P>There is then no manner of Argument from the Performance of his Model: An Averrment in &s;uch Ca&s;es is very Doubtful and Pre&s;umptuous, and the Event has put very Wi&s;e Men to a <HI>Nonplus.</HI> As great Certainties, and as well Founded as This, have utterly failed in the Proof, as in the Experiment of the Diving Engines, where there appear'd a wonderful Di&s;pro|portion in the Effects of the Model, and the main Works.</P>
<P>The Di&s;ingenuity of the&s;e Patentees ought to be Con&s;ider'd, who have made bold to Mi&s;apply to their Service, a Certificate given by the <HI>Chirurgeons</HI> in favour of a much more Con&s;ider|able <HI>Invention;</HI> which has &s;o far approv'd it &s;elf by &s;undry full and open Experiments, as to merit a Vote from the Hou&s;e of Commons, the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ions, for its Favour and Encouragement. This is a very Un-Gentleman-like Prevarication, to Impo&s;e a Certificate of another's Invention upon the World, in Evidence of the goodne&s;s of their Project: And in <HI>primo limine,</HI> in the very beginning of their Endeavours gives us probable Grounds to &s;u&s;pect the Sincerity of their whole Proceeding.</P>
<P>Again, con&s;idering they Affirm their Invention to be &s;o Con|triv'd, that it will take very little Room, requires little Labour, not Difficult, but done with &s;mall Charge, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> If it be &s;o Cheap and Ea&s;ie, had it not been rea&s;onable for them to have made their Experiment at large, in a Ship already Built, and not pre|tend
<PB REF="3">to Wheedle Mankind with the <HI>Chimerical</HI> Effects of an In&s;ignificant Model? This wou'd have put the Matter out of all Di&s;pute, and have been a Noble and Inconte&s;table Induce|ment to bring in Sub&s;cribers.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, one of the Patentees offers, upon a Conditional Re|ward, to go to <HI>Holland</HI> in a Ship that has &s;uch Breaches, that Twenty of the be&s;t known Pumps, tho' manag'd with as many Hands as can Work them, &s;hall not be able to &s;ave her from &s;inking Four or Five Hours together: But it would have been much more for his purpo&s;e, if he could truly have told us, that he return'd from thence in &s;uch a Ship. All this, he &s;ays, is to be done with the U&s;e but of Two Pumps, &s;tanding in as little Room, and requiring as little Strength, as tho&s;e now ge|nerally u&s;ed.</P>
<P>Now it is to be Ob&s;erved, That a Ship Pump, in U&s;e, delivers Eighty Tun of Water in an Hour; and a Gentleman preten|ded to the la&s;t Parliament, to produce a Pump &s;hou'd do Fifteen times as much, which Amounts to Twelve Hundred Tun an Hour, and the&s;e Two little Pumps pretend to exceed that Twenty times, which ari&s;es to Twenty four Thou&s;and Tun of Water an Hour: <HI>Credentne Po&s;teri!</HI> Here's a brave Foundation now, whereon to build a Creed for <HI>Apella</HI> the <HI>Jew!</HI> For no Man but a <HI>Solifidian</HI> can Entertain &s;uch a Be|lief.</P>
<P>Again, A <HI>Secret,</HI> liable to &s;o many Doubts and Objecti|ons, and yet promi&s;ing &s;uch wonderful Effects, ought not to be hid in the Dark. It ought to &s;upport it &s;elf upon its own Sufficiency, and not &s;uppo&s;e that the Atte&s;tation of a few pri|vate Gentlemen, is &s;ufficient to Overbear and Inveigle Mankind into Prepo&s;terous Sub&s;criptions again&s;t common Rea&s;on, and plain Sence, without very good <HI>Security,</HI> that the Sub&s;cribers &s;hall be reimbur&s;ed their Payments, if the Project prove ineffe|ctual. Truth loves the open Light; 'tis Error and Impo&s;ture that de&s;ires Veils and Lurking Holes; to Conceal the My&s;tery of their Project, under pretence of making an Advantage with Fo|reign
<PB REF="4">N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">tions, &s;mells very Rank of Partiality and De&s;ign; as the Treaty they &s;ay they are upon with the <HI>French, Dutch, Sweeds,</HI> and other Neighbouring States, by way of Advantage and Rewards.</P>
<P>It had been a fairer Proceeding, to have po&s;tpon'd the va&s;t De&s;ire of Improving their own Intere&s;t, to the Good of the Pub|lick, and not pretend to go Proling and Hawking abroad af|ter Foreign Rewards, and in the mean while neglect the put|ting their Works forward at Home, for the Good of their Country. By this Method they wou'd have gotten more by ad|vancing the Value of their Shares, than they could rea&s;onably expect from tho&s;e Exotic Rewards: Which, be&s;ides, if the In|vention an&s;wers their Preten&s;ions, can never be lo&s;t. This would have facilitated the De&s;ign of engaging Sub&s;cribers, and have been no Prejudice to the Undertakers, becau&s;e they are a&s;&s;ur'd of their Invention.</P>
<P>Again, The&s;e Propo&s;als are Matters of great Con&s;equence; 60000 <HI>l.</HI> is a very large Summ, to be rais'd upon a blind Con|fidence, and requires a due and mature Con&s;ideration of the Foundation, whereon they are built, and can never, without a &s;trict Examination, have any Weight with thinking Men, much le&s;s a Parliament, who know by Experience, That main Works very often fall &s;hort, in an&s;wering the Ends that Mo|dels pretend to.</P>
<P>If they alledge, that the Sincerity and Integrity of the Per|&s;ons Certifying, is a &s;ufficient Foundation for Encouragement of Sub&s;criptions; I reply, That nothing but meer Hopes of Gain, can induce any Rational Man into &s;uch a Belief, who knows that Water in its own Nature will not ri&s;e above its Le|vel without Force or Violence: And that Length, Breadth and Depth, Number, Weight and Mea&s;ure, Centre and Cir|cumference, give Laws to all Natural and Mechanical Moti|ons. Neither do the Qualifications of the Per&s;ons, making or compo&s;ing any Engine or In&s;trument, whether they are Wi&s;e and Hone&s;t, Knaves or Fools, vary its Effects. For as
<PB N="7" REF="4">they are Compo&s;ed, &s;o they will Operate; for the L<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">w of Na|ture is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">overaign, and without Subjection.</P>
<P>To Conclude; for Innumerable In&s;tances of Su&s;picion and In&s;incerity may be advanced again&s;t the&s;e Propo&s;als; they tell us, that for removing all Doubts, and for full Satisfaction of all Per&s;ons that &s;hall be concerned with them, they re&s;olve and declare, that no more than Fifty Shillings &s;hall be paid, till a Conditional Grant of a Reward is obtain'd from the Go|vernment, and a Trial of the &s;aid Invention be made by a Voyage to <HI>Holland,</HI> and the &s;afe Arrival of the Ship at <HI>Rot|terdam.</HI></P>
<P>This is a new way of Removing of Doubts, by throwing us into greater; for 'tis de&s;ir'd they would make it out, how a Promi&s;e of a Conditional Reward from the Government, will any ways a&s;certain the Truth of their Invention? And how a Certificate from a Notary Public in <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> is of any Avail, to ju&s;tifie what pa&s;t in the Ship at Sea? Surely they needed not have been in &s;uch ha&s;te; but have &s;tay'd till the &s;afe Return of the Ship to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But what &s;eems more &s;trange to me, is, That they abate the Value of their Invention, as they fall in their Price. For when they propos'd their Invention, at 60000 <HI>l.</HI> Mr. <HI>Lurtin</HI> and Mr. <HI>Warren</HI> were for making the Experiment in a Ship to the <HI>Streights,</HI> or the <HI>We&s;t-Indies;</HI> but now when they have de&s;cen|ded to a Sub&s;cription but of 15000 <HI>l.</HI> they will make their Voyage but to <HI>Holland:</HI> It &s;eems now they begin to mi&s;tru&s;t the Sufficiency of their Invention, being caution'd, perhaps, by the Succe&s;s of Sir <HI>William Petty</HI>'s <HI>Double-Keel'd Experiment.</HI></P>
<P>You may under&s;tand, Sir, by the&s;e few Obvious Hints, what a Ba&s;is &s;uch mighty Preten&s;ions are founded on: Notwith|&s;tanding which, they have the Vanity to tell the World, in the <HI>Flying-Po&s;t,</HI> that &s;everal eminent Merchants have &s;ignify'd their Intentions to Sub&s;cribe, and Pay large Sums of Money beforehand, to &s;ave them&s;elves the Trouble of Attending.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="5">
<P> This is a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 chunk">er palpable Plan, and as Incredible as the Prin|<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 chunk"> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ropo&s;al it &s;elf; certainly 'tis the fir&s;t time that ever the, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters">rchants were &s;o fond of parting with their Money, e&s;pe|cially upon a Pro&s;pect &s;o doubtful, that few or none have yet been let into the My&s;tery of the Invention.</P>
<P>Really, Sir&punc; I would do any thing, rather than le&s;&s;en the Reputation of any Propo&s;al that &s;hou'd tend to the Advan|tage of Mankind: But this is the bolde&s;t Stroke that I ever met with, propos'd with a &s;erious Countenance; and a Pro&s;pect of &s;uch Effect and Influence as this pretends to, &s;ought to have &s;omething more than a bare Atte&s;tation for its Encourage|ment and Confirmation.</P>
<P>When they have fini&s;h'd this Exploit, I hope they will find out a Method to teach Ships to fly, and &s;hape a better Cour&s;e to the Moon, than Mon&s;ieur <HI>Bajerac</HI> with all his Wit cou'd ever imagine.</P>
<P>Sir, I &s;hall interrupt you no farther, but recommend the Propo&s;al it &s;elf to your Peru&s;al, which I doubt not will give you a &s;econd Tedious Entertainment.</P>
