<P>_THat a Stranger &s;hould pre&s;ume (though with Sir <HI>William Berk|ly</HI>'s Commi&s;&s;ion) to go into tho&s;e Parts of the <HI>American</HI> Continent where <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> never had been, and whi|ther &s;ome refu&s;ed to accompany him, was, in <HI>Virginia</HI> look'd on as &s;o great an in&s;olence, that our Traveller at his Return, in&s;tead of Welcom and Applau&s;e, met nothing but Af|fronts and Reproaches; for indeed it was their part, that for&s;ook him in the Expedi|tion, to procure him di&s;credit that was a witne&s;s to theirs: Therefore no indu&s;try was wanting to prepare Men with a prejudice against him, and this their malice improved to &s;uch a general Animo&s;ity, that he was not &s;afe in <HI>Virginia</HI> from the outrage of the Peo|ple, drawn into a per&s;wa&s;ion, that the Pub|lick Levy of that year, went all to the ex|pence
<PB REF="4">of his Vagaries. Forced by this &s;torm into <HI>Maryland,</HI> he became known to me, though then ill-affected to the Man, by the &s;tories that went about of him: Neverthe|le&s;s finding him, contrary to my expectation, a mode&s;t ingenious per&s;on, &amp; a pretty Scho|lar, I thought it common Ju&s;tice to give him an occa&s;ion of vindicating him&s;elf from what I had heard of him; which truly he did with &s;o convincing Rea&s;on and circum|&s;tance, as quite aboli&s;hed tho&s;e former im|pre&s;&s;ions in me, and made me de&s;ire this Ac|count of his Travels, which here you have faithfully rendred out of Latine from his own Writings and Di&s;cour&s;e, with an entire Map of the Territory he traver&s;ed, copied from his own hand.

<HEAD>THE Di&s;coveries of JOHN LEDERER from <HI>Virginia</HI> to the We&s;t of <HI>Carolina,</HI> and other parts of the Continent.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>A General and brief Account of the North-<HI>American</HI> Continent.</HEAD>
<P>_NOrth, as well as South-<HI>America,</HI> may be di|vided into three Regions: the Flats, the Highlands, and the Mountains. The Flats (in Indian, <HI>Ahkynt</HI>) is the Terri|tory lying between the Ea&s;tern Coa&s;t, and the falls of the great Rivers, that there run into the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean, in extent generally taken Ninety miles. The Highlands (in Indian, <HI>Ahkont&s;huck</HI>) begin at tho&s;e falls, and determine at the foot of the great ridge of Mountains that runs thorow the mid&s;t of this Con|tinent, Northea&s;t and Southwe&s;t, called by the Spaniards <HI>A|palataei,</HI> from the Nation <HI>Apalakin;</HI> and by the Indians, <HI>Pae|motinck.</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="7">According to the be&s;t of my ob&s;ervation and con|jecture, they lie parallel to the <HI>Altantick</HI> Sea-coa&s;t, that bearing from <HI>Canada</HI> to Cape <HI>Florida,</HI> Northea&s;t and South|we&s;t, and then falling off due We&s;t as the Mountains do at <HI>Sara:</HI> but here they take the name of <HI>Suala; Sara</HI> in the <HI>Warrennuncock</HI> dialect being <HI>Sa&s;a</HI> or <HI>Sualy.</HI></P>
<P>The Flats, of <HI>Ahkynt,</HI> are by former Writers made &s;o well known to Chri&s;tendom, that I will not &s;top the Reader here, with an unnece&s;&s;ary de&s;cription of them; but &s;hall onely &s;ay, that by the rankne&s;s of the Soyl, and &s;alt moi&s;t|ne&s;s of the Air, daily di&s;coveries of Fi&s;h-&s;hells three fathom deep in the earth, and Indian tradition; the&s;e parts are &s;up|po&s;ed &s;ome Ages pa&s;t to have lain under the Sea.</P>
<P>The Highlands (or <HI>Ahkont&s;huch</HI>) though under the &s;ame Parallels, are happie notwith&s;tanding in a more temperate and healthful Air. The ground is over-grown with under|wood in many places, and that &s;o perplext and interwoven with Vines, that who travels here, mu&s;t &s;ometimes cut through his way. The&s;e Thickets harbour all &s;orts of bea&s;ts of prey, as Wolves, Panthers, Leopards, Lions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (which are neither &s;o large nor &s;o fierce as tho&s;e of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Africa</HI>) and &s;mall Vermine, as wilde Cats, Foxes, Racoons. The&s;e parts were formerly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Tacci,</HI> ali&agrave;s <HI>Dogi;</HI> but they are extinct; and the Indians now &s;eated here, are di|&s;tingui&s;hed into the &s;everal Nations of <HI>Mahoc, Nuntaneuck,</HI> a|li&agrave;s <HI>Nuntaly, Nahy&s;&s;an, Sapon, Managog, Mangoack, Akenat|zy,</HI> and <HI>Monakin,</HI> &amp;c. One Language is common to them all, though they differ in Dialects. The parts inhabited here are plea&s;ant and fruitful, becau&s;e cleared of Wood, and laid open to the Sun. The Valleys feed numerous herds of Deer and Elks larger then Oxen: the&s;e Valleys they call <HI>Savanae,</HI> being Mari&s;h grounds at the foot of the <HI>Apalataei,</HI> and year|ly laid under water in the beginning of Summer by flouds of melted Snow falling down from the Mountains.</P>
<P>The <HI>Apalataean</HI> Mountains, called in Indian <HI>Paemotinck,</HI> (or the origine of the Indians) are barren Rocks, and
<PB N="3" REF="7">therefore de&s;erted by all living creatures but Bears, who cave in the hollow Cliffs. Yet do the&s;e Mountains &s;hoot out to the Ea&s;tward great Promontories of rich Land, known by the high and &s;preading trees which they bear: the&s;e Pro|montories, becau&s;e lower then the main Ridge, are called by the Indians <HI>Tanx-Paemotinck</HI> (ali&agrave;s <HI>Aquatt</HI>). To the North|ea&s;t the Mountains ri&s;e higher; and at <HI>Sara</HI> they &s;ink &s;o low, that they are ea&s;ily pa&s;&s;ed over: but here (as was &s;aid before) they change their cour&s;e and name, running due We&s;t, and being called <HI>Sualy:</HI> now the <HI>Sualian</HI> Mountains ri&s;e higher and higher We&s;tward.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Manners and Customs of the <HI>Indi|ans</HI> inhabiting the We&s;tern parts of <HI>Ca|rolina</HI> and <HI>Virginia.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Indians now &s;eated in the&s;e parts, are none of tho&s;e which the Engli&s;h removed from <HI>Virginiae,</HI> but a peo|ple driven by an Enemy from the Northwe&s;t, and invited to &s;it down here by an Oracle above four hundred years &s;ince, as they pretend: for the ancient inhabitants of <HI>Virginia</HI> were far more rude and barbarous, feeding onely upon raw fle&s;h and fi&s;h, until the&s;e taught them to plant Corn, and &s;hewed them the u&s;e of it.</P>
<P>But before I treat of their ancient Manners and Cu&s;toms, it is nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould &s;hew by what means the knowledge of them hath been conveyed from former ages to po&s;terity. Three ways they &s;upply their want of Letters: fir&s;t by Counters, &s;econdly by Emblemes or Hieroglyphicks, third|ly Tradition delivered in long Tales from father to &s;on, which being children they are made to learn by rote.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="8">
<P>For Counters, they u&s;e either Pebbles, or &s;hort &s;cantlings of &s;traw or reeds. Where a Batted has been fought, or a Colony &s;eated, they rai&s;e a &s;mall Pyramid of the&s;e &s;tones, con&s;i&s;ting of the number &s;lain or tran&s;planted. Their reeds and &s;traws &s;erve them in Religious Ceremonies: for they lay them orderly in a Circle when they prepare for Devo|tion or Sacrifice; and that performed, the Circle remains &s;till; for it is Sacriledge to di&s;turb or to touch it: the di&s;|po&s;ition and &s;orting of the &s;traws and reeds, &s;hew what kinde of Rites have there been celebrated, as Invocation, Sa|crifice, Burial, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The faculties of the minde and body they commonly ex|pre&s;s by Emblems. By the figure of a Stag, they imply &s;wiftne&s;s; by that of a Serpent, wrath; of a Lion, courage; of a Dog, fidelity: by a Swan, they &s;ignifie the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> alluding to their complexion, and flight over the Sea.</P>
<P>An account of Time, and other things, they keep on a &s;tring or leather thong tied in knots of &s;everal colours. I took particular notice of &s;mall Wheels &s;erving for this purpo&s;e among&s;t the <HI>Oenocks,</HI> becau&s;e I have heard that the <HI>Mexicans</HI> u&s;e the &s;ame. Every Nation gives his particular En&s;igne or Arms: The <HI>Sa&s;que&s;ahanaugh</HI> a Tarapine, or &s;mall Tortoi&s;e; the <HI>Akenatzy's</HI> a Serpent; the <HI>Nahy&s;&s;anes</HI> three Arrows, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In this they likewi&s;e agree with the <HI>Mexican</HI> Indians. <HI>Vid. Jo&s;. &agrave; Co&s;ta.</HI></P>
<P>They wor&s;hip one God, Creator of all things, whom &s;ome call <HI>Okae&egrave;,</HI> others <HI>Mannith:</HI> to him alone the High-prie&s;t, or <HI>Periku,</HI> offers Sacrifice; and yet they believe he has no regard to &s;ublunary affairs, but commits the Government of Mankinde to le&s;&s;er Deities, as <HI>Quiaco&s;ough</HI> and <HI>Tagka|ny&s;ough,</HI> that is, good and evil Spirits: to the&s;e the inferi|our Prie&s;ts pay their devotion and Sacrifice, at which they make recitals, to a lamentable Tune, of the great things done by their Ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>From four women, <HI>viz. Pa&s;h, Sepoy, Askarin,</HI> and <HI>Mara|skarin,</HI> they derive the Race of Mankinde; which they
<PB N="5" REF="8">therefore divide into four Tribes, di&s;tingui&s;hed under tho&s;e &s;everal names. They very religiou&s;ly ob&s;erve the degrees of Marriage, which they limit not to di&s;tance of Kindred, but difference of Tribes, which are continued in the i&s;&s;ue of the Females: now for two of the &s;ame Tribe to match, is ab|horred as Ince&s;t, and puni&s;hed with great &s;everity.</P>
<P>Their places of Burial they divide into four quarters, a&s;|&s;igning to every Tribe one: for, to mingle their bodies, e|ven when dead, they hold wicked and ominous. They commonly wrap up the corp&s;e in bea&s;ts skins, and bury with it Provi&s;ion and Hou&s;hold&s;tuff for its u&s;e in the other world. When their great men die, they likewi&s;e &s;lay pri&s;o|ners of War to attend them. They believe the tran&s;mi|gration of &s;ouls: for the Angry they &s;ay is po&s;&s;e&s;t with the &s;pirit of a Serpent; the Bloudy, with that of a Wolf; the Timorous, of a Deer; the Faithful, of a Dog, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and therefore they are figured by the&s;e Emblemes.</P>
<P><HI>Elizium,</HI> or the abode of their le&s;&s;er Deities, they place beyond the Mountains and Indian Ocean.</P>
<P>Though they want tho&s;e means of improving Humane Rea&s;on, which the u&s;e of Letters affords us; let us not therefore conclude them wholly de&s;titute of Learning and Sciences: for by the&s;e little helps which they have found, many of them advance their natural under&s;tandings to great knowledge in Phy&s;ick, Rhetorick, and Policie of Govern|ment: for I have been pre&s;ent at &s;everal of their Con&s;ulta|tions and Debates, and to my admiration have heard &s;ome of their Seniors deliver them&s;elves with as much Judgement and Eloquence as I &s;hould have expected from men of Ci|vil education and Literature.</P>

<HEAD>The Fir&s;t EXPEDITION, From the head of <HI>Pemaeoncock,</HI> ali&agrave;s <HI>York-River</HI> (due We&s;t&punc; to the top of the <HI>A|palataean</HI> Mountains.</HEAD>
<P>UPon the ninth of <HI>March</HI> 1669, (with three Indians who&s;e names were <HI>Magtakunh, Hopottoguoh,</HI> and <HI>Naunnugh</HI>) I went out at the falls of <HI>Pemaeoncock</HI> ali&agrave;s <HI>York-River</HI> in <HI>Virginia,</HI> from an Indian Village called <HI>Shicke|hamany,</HI> and lay that night in the Woods, encountring no|thing remarkable, but a Rattle-&s;nake of an extraordinary length and thickne&s;s, for I judged it two yards and a half or better from head to tail, and as big about as a mans arm: by the di&s;tention of her belly, we believed her full with young; but having killed and opened her, found there a &s;mall Squirrel whole; which cau&s;ed in me a double won|der: fir&s;t, how a Reptile &s;hould catch &s;o nimble a creature as a Squirrel; and having caught it, how &s;he could &s;wallow it entire. The Indians in re&s;olving my doubts, plunged me into a greater a&s;toni&s;hment, when they to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">d me that it was u&s;ual in the&s;e Serpents, when they lie basking in the Sun, to fetch down the&s;e Squirrels from the tops of trees, by fixing their eyes &s;tedfa&s;tly upon them; the horrour of which &s;trikes &s;uch an affrightment into the little bea&s;t, that he has no power to hinder him&s;elf from tumbling down into the jaws of his enemy, who takes in all his &s;u&s;tenance without chew|ing, his teeth &s;erving him onely to offend withal. But I ra|ther believe what I have heard from others, that the&s;e Ser|pents climb the trees, and &s;urpri&s;e their prey in the ne&s;t.</P>
<P>The next day talling into Mari&s;h grounds between <HI>Pemae|oncock</HI> and the head of the River <HI>Matapeneugh,</HI> the heavine&s;s of the way obliged me to cro&s;s <HI>Pemaeoncock,</HI> where its North
<PB N="7" REF="9">and South-branch (called <HI>Ackmick</HI>) joyn in one. In the Penin&s;ula made by the&s;e two branches, a great Indian King called <HI>Tottopottoma</HI> was heretofore &s;lain in Battel, fighting for the Chri&s;tians again&s;t the <HI>Mahocks</HI> and <HI>Nahy&s;&s;ans,</HI> from whence it retains his name to this day. Travelling thorow the Woods, a Doe &s;eized by a wild Cat cro&s;&s;ed our way; the mi&s;erable creature being even &s;pent and breathle&s;s with the burden and cruelty of her rider, who having fa&s;tned on her &s;houlder, left not &s;ucking out her bloud until &s;he &s;unk under him: which one of the Indians perceiving, let flie a luckie Arrow, which piercing him thorow the belly, made him quit his prey already &s;lain, and turn with a terrible grimas at us; but his &s;trength and &s;pirits failing him, we e&s;caped his re|venge, which had certainly en&s;ued, were not his wound mortal. This creature is &s;omething bigger then our Eng|li&s;h Fox, of a reddi&s;h grey colour, and in figure every way agreeing with an ordinary Cat; fierce, ravenous and cun|ning: for finding the Deer (upon which they delight mo&s;t to prey) too &s;wift for them, they watch upon branches of trees, and as they walk or feed under, jump down upon them. The Fur. of the wilde Cat, thought not very fine, is yet e&s;teemed for its vertue in taking away cold Aches and Pains, being worn next to the body: their fle&s;h, though rank as a Dogs, is eaten by the Indians.</P>
<P>The eleventh and twelfth, I found the ways very uneven, and cumbred with bu&s;hes.</P>
<P>The thirteenth, I reached the fir&s;t Spring of <HI>Pemaeoncock,</HI> having cro&s;&s;ed the River four times that day, by rea&s;on of its many windings; but the water was &s;o &s;hallow, that it hardly wet my hor&s;es pa&s;terns. Here a little under the &s;ur|face of the earth, I found flat pieces petrified matter, of one &s;ide &s;olid Stone, but on the other &s;ide I &s;inglas, which I ea|&s;ily peeled off in flakes about four inches &s;quare: &s;everal of the&s;e pieces, with a tran&s;parent Stone like Cry&s;tal that cut Gla&s;s, and a white Marcha&s;ite that I purcha&s;ed of the Indi|ans, I pre&s;ented to Sir <HI>William Berkley</HI> Governour of <HI>Virginia.</HI></P>
<PB N="8" REF="10">
<P>The fourteenth of <HI>March,</HI> from the top of an eminent hill, I fir&s;t de&s;cried the <HI>Apalataean</HI> Mountains, bearing due We&s;t to the place I &s;tood upon: their di&s;tance from me was &s;o great, that I could hardly di&s;cern whether they were Mountains or Clouds, until my Indian fellow travellers pro|&s;trating them&s;elves in Adoration, howled out after a bar|barous manner, <HI>Ok&eacute;e poeze,</HI> i. e. <HI>God is nigh.</HI></P>
<P>The fifteenth of <HI>March,</HI> not far from this hill, pa&s;&s;ing o|ver the South-branch of <HI>Rappahanock</HI>-river, I was almo&s;t &s;wallowed in a Quick&s;and. Great herds of Red and Fallow Deer I daily &s;aw feeding; and on the hill-&s;ides, Bears cra&s;h|ing Ma&s;t like Swine. Small Leopards I have &s;een in the Woods, but never any Lions, though their skins are much worn by the Indians.

<P>The eighteenth of <HI>March,</HI> after I had in vain a&s;&s;ayed to ride up, I alighted, and left my hor&s;e with one of the In|dians, whil&s;t with the other two I climbed up the Rocks, which were &s;o incumbred with bu&s;hes and brambles, that the a&s;cent proved very difficult: be&s;ides, the fir&s;t precipice was &s;o &s;teep, that if I lookt down, I was immediately taken with a &s;wimming in my head; though afterwards the way was more ea&s;ie. The height of this Mountain was very extraordinary: for notwith&s;tanding I &s;et out with the fir&s;t appearance of light, it was late in the evening before I gain|ed the top, from whence the next morning I had a beautiful

<HEAD>The Second EXPEDITION, From the Falls of <HI>Powhatan,</HI> ali&agrave;s <HI>James-River,</HI> in <HI>Virginia,</HI> to <HI>Mahock</HI> in the <HI>Apalataean</HI> Mountains.</HEAD>
<P>THe twentieth of <HI>May</HI> 1670, one Major <HI>Harris</HI> and my &s;elf, with twenty <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Hor&s;e, and five <HI>Indians,</HI> marched from the Falls of <HI>James-River,</HI> in <HI>Virginia,</HI> to|wards the <HI>Monakins;</HI> and on the Two and twentieth were welcomed by them with Volleys of Shot. Near this Village we ob&s;erved a Pyramid of &s;tones piled up together, which their Prie&s;ts told us, was the Number of an <HI>Indian</HI> Colony drawn out by Lot from a Neighbour-Countrey o|ver-peopled, and led hither by one <HI>Monack,</HI> from whom they take the Name of <HI>Monakin.</HI> Here enquiring the way to the Mountains, an ancient Man de&s;cribed with a &s;taffe two paths on the ground; one pointing to the <HI>Mahocks,</HI> and the other to the <HI>Nahy&s;&s;ans;</HI> but my <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Compani|ons &s;lighting the <HI>Indians</HI> direction, &s;haped their cour&s;e by the Compa&s;s due We&s;t, and therefore it fell out with us, as
<PB N="10" REF="11">it does with tho&s;e Land-Crabs, that crawling backwards in a direct line, avoid not the Trees that &s;tand in their way, but climbing over their very tops, come down again on the other &s;ide, and &s;o after a days labour gain not above two foot of ground. Thus we ob&s;tinately pur&s;uing a due We&s;t cour&s;e, rode over &s;teep and craggy Cliffs, which beat our Hor&s;es quite off the hoof. In the&s;e Mountains we wan|dred from the Twenty fifth of <HI>May</HI> till the Third of <HI>June,</HI> finding very little &s;u&s;tenance for Man or Hor&s;e; for the&s;e places are de&s;titute both of Grain and Herbage.</P>
<P>The third of <HI>June</HI> we came to the South-branch of <HI>James</HI>-River, which Major <HI>Harris</HI> ob&s;erving to run North|ward, vainly imagined to be an Arm of the Lake of <HI>Ca|nada;</HI> and was &s;o tran&s;ported with this Fancy, that he would have rai&s;ed a Pillar to the Di&s;covery, if the fear of the <HI>Mahock Indian,</HI> and want of food, had permitted him to &s;tay. Here I moved to cro&s;s the Rive and march on; but the re&s;t of the Company were &s;o weary of the enterprize, that crying out, <HI>One and All,</HI> they had offered violence to me, had I not been provided with a private Commi&s;&s;ion from the Governour of <HI>Virginia</HI> to proceed, though the re&s;t of the company &s;hould abandon me; the &s;ight of which laid their fury.</P>
<P>The le&s;&s;er Hills, or <HI>Akont&s;huck,</HI> are here unpa&s;&s;able, be|ing both &s;teep and craggy; the Rocks &s;eemed to me at a di|&s;tance to re&s;emble Eggs &s;et up an end.</P>
<P><HI>James</HI>-River is here as broad as it is about an hundred mile lower at <HI>Monakin;</HI> the pa&s;&s;age over is very dangerous, by rea&s;on of the rapid Torrents made by Rocks and Shelves forcing the water into narrow Chanels. From an ob&s;erva|tion which we made of &s;traws and rotten chuncks hanging in the boughs of Trees on the Bank, and two and twenty foot above water, we argued that the melted Snow falling from the Mountains &s;welled the River to that height, the Flood carrying down that rubbi&s;h which, upon the abate|ment of the Inundation, remained in the Trees.</P>

<P>THe fifth of <HI>June,</HI> my Company and I parted good friends, they back again, and I with one <HI>Sa&s;que&s;a|hanough-Indian,</HI> named <HI>Jackzetavon,</HI> only, in pur&s;uit of my fir&s;t Enterprize, changing my cour&s;e from We&s;t to South|we&s;t &amp; by South, to avoid the Mountains. Major <HI>Harris</HI> at parting gave me a Gun, believing me a lo&s;t man, and gi|ven up as a prey to <HI>Indians</HI> or &s;avage Bea&s;ts; which made him the bolder in <HI>Virginia</HI> to report &s;trange things in his own prai&s;e and my di&s;paragement, pre&s;uming I would ne|ver appear to di&s;prove him. This, I &s;uppo&s;e, and no other, was the cau&s;e that he did with &s;o much indu&s;try procure me di&s;credit and odium; but I have lo&s;t nothing by it, but what I never &s;tudied to gain, which is Popular applau&s;e.</P>
<P>From the fifth, which was <HI>Sunday,</HI> until the ninth of <HI>June,</HI> I travelled through difficult Ways, without &s;eeing any Town or <HI>Indian;</HI> and then I arrived at <HI>Sapon,</HI> a Village of the <HI>Nahy&s;&s;ans,</HI> about an hundred miles di&s;tant from <HI>Mahock,</HI> &s;cituate upon a branch of <HI>Shawan,</HI> ali&agrave;s <HI>Rorenock</HI>-River; and though I had ju&s;t cau&s;e to fear the&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> becau&s;e they had been in continual Ho&s;tility with the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> for
<PB N="12" REF="12">ten years before; yet pre&s;uming that the Truck which I carried with me would procure my welcome, I adventured to put my &s;elf into their power, having heard that they never offer any injury to a few per&s;ons from whom they ap|prehend no danger: neverthele&s;s, they examined me &s;trict|ly whence I came, whither I went, and what my bu&s;ine&s;s was. But after I had be&s;towed &s;ome trifles of Gla&s;s and Metal among&s;t them, they were &s;atisfied with rea&s;onable an&s;wers, and I received with all imaginable demon&s;trations of kindne&s;s, as offering of Sacrifice, a complement &s;hewed only to &s;uch as they de&s;ign particularly to honour: but they went further, and con&s;ulted their Godds whether they &s;hould not admit me into their Nation and Councils, and oblige me to &s;tay among&s;t them by a Marriage with the Kings or &s;ome of their great Mens Daughters. But I, though with much a-do, waved their courte&s;ie, and got my Pa&s;tport, having given my word to return to them within &s;ix months.</P>
<P><HI>Sapon</HI> is within the limits of the Province of <HI>Carolina,</HI> and as you may perceive by the Figure, has all the attributes requi&s;ite to a plea&s;ant and advantagious Seat; for though it &s;tands high, and upon a dry land, it enjoyes the benefit of a &s;tately River, and a rich Soyl, capable of producing many Commodities, which may hereafter render the Trade of it con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>Not far di&s;tant from hence, as I under&s;tood from the <HI>Nahy&s;&s;an</HI> Indians, is their Kings Re&s;idence, called <HI>Pintahae,</HI> upon the &s;ame River, and happy in the &s;ame advantages both for plea&s;ure and profit: which my curio&s;ity would have led me to &s;ee, were I not bound, both by Oath and Commi&s;&s;ion, to a direct pur&s;uance of my intended purpo&s;e of di&s;covering a pa&s;&s;age to the further &s;ide of the Moun|tains.</P>
<P>This Nation is governed by an ab&s;olute Monarch; the People of a high &s;tature, warlike and rich. I &s;aw great &s;tore
<PB N="13" REF="12">of Pearl unbored in their little Temples, or Oratories, which they had won among&s;t other &s;poyls from the Indians of <HI>Florida,</HI> and hold in as great e&s;teem as we do.</P>
<P>From hence, by the Indians in&s;tructions, I directed my cour&s;e to <HI>Akenatzy,</HI> and I&s;land bearing South &amp; by We&s;t, and about fifty miles di&s;tant, upon a branch of the &s;ame Ri|ver, from <HI>Sapon.</HI> The Countrey here, though high, is le|vel, and for the mo&s;t part a rich &s;oyl, as I judged by the growth of the Trees; yet where it is inhabited by Indians, it lies open in &s;pacious Plains, and is ble&s;&s;ed with a very healthful Air, as appears by the age and vigour of the peo|ple; and though I travelled in the month of <HI>June,</HI> the heat of the weather hindred me not from Riding at all hours without any great annoyance from the Sun. By ea&s;ie jour|neys I landed at <HI>Akenatzy</HI> upon the twelfth of <HI>June.</HI> The current of the River is here &s;o &s;trong, that my Hor&s;e had much difficulty to re&s;i&s;t it; and I expected every &s;tep to be carried away with the &s;tream.</P>
<P>This I&s;land, though &s;mall, maintains many inhabitants, who are fix'd here in great &s;ecurity, being naturally fortified with Fa&s;tne&s;&s;es of Mountains, and Water of every &s;ide. Up|on the North-&s;hore they yearly reap great crops of Corn, of which they always have a twelv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">-months Provi&s;ion afore|hand, again&s;t an Inva&s;ion from their powerful Neighbours. Their Government is under two Kings, one pre&s;iding in Arms, the other in Hunting and Husbandry. They hold all things, except their Wives, in common; and their cu|&s;tome in eating is, that every man in his turn fea&s;ts all the re&s;t; and he that makes the entertainment, is &s;eated betwixt the two Kings; where having highly commended his own chear, they carve and di&s;tribute it among&s;t the gue&s;ts.</P>
<P>At my arrival here, I met four &s;tranger-Indians, who&s;e Bodies were painted in various colours with figures of Ani|mals who&s;e likene&s;s I had never &s;een: and by &s;ome di&s;|cour&s;e and &s;ignes which pa&s;&s;ed between us, I gathered that they were the only &s;urvivours of fifty, who &s;et out together
<PB N="14" REF="13">in company from &s;ome great I&s;land, as I conjecture, to the Northwe&s;t; for I under&s;tood that they cro&s;&s;ed a great Wa|ter, in which mo&s;t of their party peri&s;hed by tempe&s;t, the re&s;t dying in the Mari&s;hes and Mountains by famine and hard weather, after a two-months travel by Land and Wa|ter in que&s;t of this I&s;land of <HI>Akenatzy.</HI></P>
<P>The mo&s;t rea&s;onable conjecture that I can frame out of this Relation, is, that the&s;e Indians might come from the I&s;land of new <HI>Albion</HI> or <HI>California,</HI> from whence we may imagine &s;ome great arm of the Indian Ocean or Bay &s;tretches into the Continent towards the <HI>Apalataean</HI> Mountains in the nature of a mid-land Sea, in which many of the&s;e Indians might have peri&s;hed. To confirm my opinion in this point, I have heard &s;everal Indians te&s;tifie, that the Nation of <HI>Ricko|hockans,</HI> who dwell not far to the We&s;tward of the <HI>Apala|taean</HI> Mountains, are &s;eated upon a Land, as they term it, of great Waves; by which I &s;uppo&s;e they mean the Sea-&s;hore.</P>
<P>The next day after my arrival at <HI>Akenatzy,</HI> a <HI>Rickohockan</HI> Amba&s;&s;adour, attended by five Indians, who&s;e faces were co|loured with <HI>Auripigmentum</HI> (in which Mineral the&s;e parts do much abound) was received, and that night invited to a Ball of their fa&s;hion; but in the height of their mirth and dancing, by a &s;moke contrived for that purpo&s;e, the Room was &s;uddenly darkned, and for what cau&s;e I know not, the <HI>Rickohockan</HI> and his Retinue barbarou&s;ly murthered. This &s;truck me with &s;uch an affrightment, that the very next day, without taking my leave of them, I &s;lunk away with my Indian Companion. Though the de&s;ire of inform|ing my &s;elf further concerning &s;ome Minerals, as <HI>Auripig|mentum, &amp;c.</HI> which I there took &s;pecial notice of, would have per&s;waded me to &s;tay longer among&s;t them, had not the bloody example of their treachery to the <HI>Rickohockans</HI> frighted me away.</P>
<P>The fourteenth of <HI>June,</HI> pur&s;uing a South-&s;outhwe&s;t cour&s;e, &s;ometimes by a beaten path, and &s;ometimes over hills and
<PB N="15" REF="13">rocks, I was forc'd to take up my quarters in the Woods: for though the <HI>Oenock</HI>-Indians, whom I then &s;ought, were not in a direct line above thirty odde miles di&s;tant from <HI>A|kenatzy,</HI> yet the Ways were &s;uch, and obliged me to go &s;o far about, that I reached not <HI>Oenock</HI> until the &s;ixteenth. The Country here, by the indu&s;try of the&s;e Indians, is very open, and clear of wood. Their Town is built round a field, where in their Sports they exerci&s;e with &s;o much la|bour and violence, and in &s;o great numbers, that I have &s;een the ground wet with the &s;weat that dropped from their bo|dies: their chief Recreation is Slinging of &s;tones. They are of mean &s;tature and courage, covetous and thievi&s;h, in|du&s;trious to earn a peny; and therefore hire them&s;elves out to their neighbours, who employ them as Carryers or Por|ters. They plant abundance of Grain, reap three Crops in a Summer, and out of their Granary &s;upply all the adja|cent parts. The&s;e and the Mountain-Indians build not their hou&s;es of Bark, but of Watling and Plai&s;ter. In Sum|mer, the heat of the weather makes them chu&s;e to lie abroad in the night under thin arbours of wilde Palm. Some hou|&s;es they have of Reed and Bark; they build them generally round: to each hou&s;e belongs a little hovel made like an oven, where they lay up their Corn and Ma&s;t, and keep it dry. They parch their Nuts and Acorns over the fire, to take away their rank Oyline&s;s; which afterwards pre&s;&s;ed, yeeld a milky liquor, and the Acorns an Amber-colour'd Oyl. In the&s;e, mingled together, they dip their Cakes at great Entertainments, and &s;o &s;erve them up to their gue&s;ts as an extraordinary dainty. Their Government is Demo|cratick; and the Sentences of their old men are received as Laws, or rather Oracles, by them.</P>
<P>Fourteen miles We&s;t-Southwe&s;t of the <HI>Oenocks,</HI> dwell the <HI>Shackory</HI>-Indians, upon a rich Soyl, and yet-abounding in Antimony, of which they &s;hewed me con&s;iderable quanti|ties. Finding them agree with the <HI>Oenocks</HI> in Cu&s;toms and Manners, I made no &s;tay here, but pa&s;&s;ing thorow their
<PB N="16" REF="14">Town, I travelled till the nineteenth of <HI>June;</HI> and then after a two days trouble&s;ome Journey thorow Thickets and Mari&s;h grounds, I arrived at <HI>Watary</HI> above fourty miles di&s;tant, and bearing We&s;t-Southwe&s;t to <HI>Shakor.</HI> This Nati|on differs in Government from all the other Indians of the&s;e parts: for they are Slaves, rather then Subjects to their King. Their pre&s;ent Monarch is a grave man, and courteous to &s;trangers: yet I could not without horrour behold his bar|barous Super&s;tition, in hiring three youths, and &s;ending them forth to kill as many young women of their Enemies as they could light on, to &s;erve his &s;on, then newly dead, in the other world, as he vainly fancyed. The&s;e youths during my &s;tay returned with skins torn off the heads and faces of three young girls, which they pre&s;ented to his Maje&s;tie, and were by him gratefully received.</P>
<P>I departed from <HI>Watary</HI> the one and twentieth of <HI>June;</HI> and keeping a We&s;t-cour&s;e for near thirty miles, I came to <HI>Sara:</HI> here I found the ways more level and ea&s;ie. <HI>Sara</HI> is not far di&s;tant from the Mountains, which here lo&s;e their height, and change their cour&s;e and name: for they run due We&s;t, and receive from the Spaniards the name of <HI>Suala.</HI> From the&s;e Mountains or Hills the Indians draw great quantities of <HI>Cinabar,</HI> with which beaten to powder they colour their faces: this Mineral is of a deeper Purple then <HI>Vermilion,</HI> and is the &s;ame which is in &s;o much e&s;teem among&s;t Phy&s;itians, being the fir&s;t element of Quick&s;ilver.</P>
<P>I did likewi&s;e, to my no &s;mall admiration, find hard cakes of white Salt among&s;t them: but whether they were made of Sea-water, or taken out of Salt-pits, I know not: but am apt to believe the later, becau&s;e the Sea is &s;o remote from them. Many other rich Commodities and Minerals there are undoubtedly in the&s;e parts, which if po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by an in|genious and indu&s;trious people, would be improved to va&s;t advantages by Trade. But having tied my &s;elf up to things onely that I have &s;een in my Travels, I will deliver no Conjectures.</P>

<P>The&s;e Indians are &s;o indi&s;creetly fond of their children, that they will not cha&s;ti&s;e them for any mi&s;chief or in&s;o|lence. A little Boy had &s;hot an Arrow thorow my body, had I not reconciled him to me with gifts: and all this an|ger was, becau&s;e I &s;purred my hor&s;e out of another Arrows way which he directed at him. This cau&s;e &s;uch a mutiny among&s;t the Youth of the Town, that the Seniors taking my hor&s;e and &s;elf into protection, had much ado (and that by intreaties and prayers, not commands) to appea&s;e them.</P>
<P>From <HI>Sara</HI> I kept a South-Southwe&s;t cour&s;e until the five and twentieth of <HI>June,</HI> and then I reached <HI>Wi&s;acky.</HI> This three-days march was more trouble&s;ome to me then all my travels be&s;ides: for the direct way which I took from <HI>Sara</HI> to <HI>Wi&s;acky,</HI> is over a continued Mari&s;h over-grown with Reeds, from who&s;e roots &s;prung knotty &s;tumps as hard and &s;harp as Flint.

<P>This Nation is &s;ubject to a neighbour-King re&s;iding up|on the bank of a great Lake called <HI>&V;&s;hery,</HI> invironed of all &s;ides with Mountains, and <HI>Wi&s;acky</HI> Mari&s;h; and therefore I will detain the Reader no longer with the di&s;cour&s;e of them, becau&s;e I comprehend them in that of <HI>&V;&s;hery.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ix and twentieth of <HI>June,</HI> having cro&s;&s;ed a fre&s;h River which runs into the Lake of <HI>&V;&s;hery,</HI> I came to the Town, which was more populous then any I had &s;een be|fore in my March. The King dwells &s;ome three miles from it, and therefore I had no opportunity of &s;eeing him the two nights which I &s;tayed there. This Prince, though his Dominions are large and populous, is in continual fear of the <HI>Ou&s;tack</HI>-Indians &s;eated on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the Lake; a people &s;o addicted to Arms, that even their wo|men come into the field, and &s;hoot Arrows over their hu&s;|bands

The men it &s;eems &s;hould fight with Silver-Hatchets: for one of the <HI>&V;&s;heryes</HI> told me they were of the &s;ame metal with the Pomel of my Sword. They are a cruel genera|tion, and prey upon people, whom they either &s;teal, or force away from the <HI>&V;&s;heryes</HI> is <HI>Periago's,</HI> to &s;acrifice to their Idols. The <HI>&V;&s;hery</HI>-women delight much in feather-orna|ments, of which they have great variety; but Peacocks in mo&s;t e&s;teem, becau&s;e rare in tho&s;e parts. They are rea&s;ona|bly hand&s;ome, and have more of civility in their carriage then I ob&s;erved in the other Nations with whom I conver|&s;ed; which is the rea&s;on that the men are more effeminate and lazie.</P>
<P>The&s;e mi&s;erable wretches are &s;trangely infatuated with il|lu&s;ions of the devil: it cau&s;ed no &s;mall horrour in me, to &s;ee one of them wrythe his neck all on one &s;ide, foam at the mouth, &s;tand bare-foot upon burning coals for near an hour, and then recovering his &s;en&s;es, leap out of the fire without hurt, or &s;igne of any. This I was an eye-witne&s;s of.</P>
<P>The water of <HI>&V;&s;hery</HI>-lake &s;eemed to my ta&s;te a little bracki&s;h; which I rather impute to &s;ome Mineral-waters which flow into it, then to any &s;altne&s;s it can take from the Sea, which we may rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e is a great way from it. Many plea&s;ant Rivulets fall into it, and it is &s;tored with great plenty of excellent fi&s;h. I judged it to be about ten leagues broad: for were not the other &s;hore very high, it could not be di&s;cerned from <HI>&V;&s;hery.</HI> How far this Lake tends We&s;terly, or where it ends, I could neither learn or gue&s;s.</P>
<P>Here I made a days &s;tay, to inform my &s;elf further in the&s;e Countries; and under&s;tood both from the <HI>&V;&s;heries,</HI> and &s;ome <HI>Sara</HI>-Indians that came to trade with them, that two-days journey and a half from hence to the Southwe&s;t, a powerful Nation of Bearded men were &s;eated, which I &s;uppo&s;e to be the Spaniards, becau&s;e the Indians never have any; it being an univer&s;al cu&s;tom among&s;t them, to prevent
<PB N="19" REF="15">their growth, by plucking the young hair out by the roots. We&s;tward lies a Government inho&s;pitable to &s;trangers; and to the North, over the <HI>Suala</HI>-mountains, lay the <HI>Rickohoc|kans.</HI> I thought it not &s;afe to venture my &s;elf among&s;t the Spaniards, le&s;t taking me for a Spy, the would either make me away, or condemn me to a perpetual Slavery in their Mines. Therefore not thinking fit to proceed further, the eight and twentieth of <HI>June</HI> I faced about, and looked homewards.</P>
<P>To avoid <HI>Wi&s;acky</HI>-Mari&s;h, I &s;haped my cour&s;e Northea&s;t; and after three days travel over hilly ways, where I met with no path or road, I fell into a barren Sandy de&s;ert, where I &s;uffered mi&s;erably for want of water; the heat of the Summer having drunk all the Springs dry, and left no &s;igne of any, but the Gravelly chanels in which they run: &s;o that if now and then I had not found a &s;tanding Pool, which provident Nature &s;et round with &s;hady Oaks, to de|fend it from the ardour of the Sun, my Indian companion, hor&s;e and &s;elf had certainly peri&s;hed with thir&s;t. In this di&s;tre&s;s we travelled till the twelfth of <HI>July,</HI> and then found the head of a River, which afterwards proved <HI>Eruco;</HI> in which we received not onely the comfort of a nece&s;&s;ary and &s;ea&s;onable refre&s;hment, but likewi&s;e the hopes of coming into a Country again where we might finde Game for food at lea&s;t, if not di&s;cover &s;ome new Nation or People. Nor did our hopes fail us: for after we had cro&s;&s;ed the River twice, we were led by it upon the fourteenth of <HI>July</HI> to the Town of <HI>Katearas,</HI> a place of great Indian Trade and Com|merce, and chief Seat of the haughty Emperour of the <HI>Zoskiroro's,</HI> called <HI>Kacku&s;ara</HI> vulgarly <HI>K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters">.</HI> His grim Maje&s;tie, upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">y fir&s;t appearance, demanded my Gun and Shot; which I willingly parted with, to ran&s;om my &s;elf out of his clutches&punc; for he was the mo&s;t proud imperious Barbarian that I met with in all my Marches. The people here at this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;eemed prepared for &s;ome extraordinary
<PB N="20" REF="16">Solemnity: for the men and the women of better &s;ort had decked them&s;elves very fine with pieces of bright Copper in their hair and ears, and about their arms and neck, which upon Fe&s;tival occa&s;ions they u&s;e as an extraordinary brave|ry: by which it &s;hould &s;eem this Country is not without rich Mines of Copper. But I dur&s;t not &s;tay to inform my &s;elf further in it, being jealous of &s;ome &s;udden mi&s;chief to|wards me from <HI>Kaskous,</HI> his nature being bloudy, and pro|voked upon any &s;light occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Therefore leaving <HI>Katearas,</HI> I travelled through the Woods until the &s;ixteenth, upon which I came to <HI>Ka|witziokan,</HI> an Indian town upon a branch of <HI>Rorenoke</HI>-ri|ver, which here I pa&s;&s;ed over, continuing my journey to <HI>Menchoerinck;</HI> and on the &s;eventeenth departing from thence, I lay all night in the Woods, and the next morning betimes going by <HI>Natoway,</HI> I reached that evening <HI>Apama|tuck</HI> in <HI>Virginia,</HI> where I was not a little overjoyed to &s;ee Chri&s;tian faces again.</P>

<HEAD>The third and la&s;t EXPEDITION, From the Falls of <HI>Rappahanock</HI>-River in <HI>Virginia,</HI> (due We&s;t) to the top of the <HI>Apalataean</HI> Mountains.</HEAD>
<P>ON the twentieth of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1670, Col. <HI>Catlet</HI> of <HI>Virgi|nia</HI> and my &s;elf, with nine Engli&s;h Hor&s;e, and five In|dians on foot, departed from the hou&s;e of one <HI>Robert Tali|fer,</HI> and that night reached the falls of <HI>Rappahanock</HI>-river, in Indian <HI>Mantepeuck.</HI></P>
<P>The next day we pa&s;&s;ed it over where it divides into two
<PB N="21" REF="16">branches North and South, keeping the main branch North of us.</P>
<P>The three and twentieth we found it &s;o &s;hallow, that it onely wet our hor&s;es hoofs.</P>
<P>The four and twentieth we travelled thorow the <HI>Savanae</HI> among&s;t va&s;t herds of Red and Fallow Deer which &s;tood ga|zing at us; and a little after, we came to the Promontories or Spurs of the <HI>Apalataean</HI>-mountains.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Savanae</HI> are low grounds at the foot of the <HI>Apa|lataeans,</HI> which all the Winter, Spring, and part of the Summer, lie under &s;now or water, when the &s;now is di&s;&s;ol|ved, which falls down from the Mountains commonly a|bout the beginning of <HI>June;</HI> and then their verdure is wonderful plea&s;ant to the eye, e&s;pecially of &s;uch as having travelled through the &s;hade of the va&s;t Fore&s;t, come out of a melancholy darkne&s;s of a &s;udden, into a clear and open skie. To heighten the beauty of the&s;e parts, the fir&s;t Springs of mo&s;t of tho&s;e great Rivers which run into the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean, or <HI>Che&s;eapeack</HI> Bay, do here break out, and in various branches interlace the flowry Meads, who&s;e luxu|rious herbage invites numerous herds of Red Deer (for their unu&s;ual largene&s;s improperly termed Elks by ignorant peo|ple) to feed. The right Elk, though very common in <HI>New Scotland, Canada,</HI> and tho&s;e Northern parts, is never &s;een on this &s;ide of the Continent: for that which the <HI>Virginians</HI> call Elks, does not at all differ from the Red Deer of <HI>Eu|rope,</HI> but in his dimen&s;ions, which are far greater: but yet the Elk in bigne&s;s does as far exceed them: their heads, or horns, are not very different; but the neck of the Elk is &s;o &s;hort, that it hardly &s;eparates the head from the &s;houlders; which is the rea&s;on that they cannot feed upon level ground but by falling on their knees, though their heads be a yard|long: therefore they commonly either brou&s;e upon trees, or &s;tanding up to the belly in ponds or rivers feed upon the banks: their Cingles or tails are hardly three inches long. I have been told by a <HI>New-England</HI>-Gentleman, that the
<PB N="22" REF="17">lips and no&s;trils of this creature is the mo&s;t delicious meat he ever ta&s;ted. As for the Red Deer we here treat of, I can|not difference the ta&s;te of their fle&s;h from tho&s;e in <HI>Eu|rope.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ix and twentieth of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> we came to the Moun|tains, where finding no hor&s;e-way up, we alighted, and left our hor&s;es with two or three Indians below, whil&s;t we went up afoot. The a&s;cent was &s;o &s;teep, the cold &s;o inten&s;e, and we &s;o tired, that having with much ado gained the top of one of the highe&s;t, we drank the Kings Health in Brandy, gave the Mountain His name, and agreed to return back again, having no encouragement from that pro&s;pect to pro|ceed to a further di&s;covery; &s;ince from hence we &s;aw ano|ther Mountain, bearing North and by We&s;t to us, of a pro|digious height: for according to an ob&s;ervation of the di|&s;tance taken by Col. <HI>Catlet,</HI> it could not be le&s;s then fifty leagues from the place we &s;tood upon.</P>
<P>Here was I &s;tung in my &s;leep by a Mountain-&s;pider; and had not an Indian &s;uckt out the poy&s;on, I had died: for re|ceiving the hurt at the tip of one of my fingers, the venome &s;hot up immediately into my &s;houlder, and &s;o inflamed my &s;ide, that it is not po&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s my torment. The means u&s;ed by my Phy&s;ician, was fir&s;t a &s;mall do&s;e of Snake|root-powder, which I took in a little water; and then ma|king a kinde of Plai&s;ter of the &s;ame, applied it neer to the part affected: when he had done &s;o, he &s;wallowed &s;ome by way of Antidote him&s;elf, and &s;uckt my fingers end &s;o vio|lently, that I felt the venome retire back from my &s;ide into my &s;houlder, and from thence down my arm: having thus &s;ucked half a &s;core times, and &s;pit as often, I was ea&s;ed of all my pain, and perfectly recovered. I thought I had been bit by a Rattle-&s;nake, for I &s;aw not what hurt me: but the Indian found by the wound, and the effects of it, that it was given by a Spider, one of which he &s;hewed me the next day: it is not unlike our great blue Spider, onely it is &s;ome|what longer. I &s;uppo&s;e the nature of his poy&s;on to be much like that of the <HI>Tarantula.</HI></P>
<PB N="23" REF="17">
<P>I being thus beyond my hopes and expectation re&s;tored to my &s;elf, we unanimou&s;ly agreed to return back, &s;eeing no po&s;&s;ibility of pa&s;&s;ing through the Mountains: and find|ing our Indians with our hor&s;es in the place where we left them, we rode homewards without making any further Di&s;covery.</P>

<HEAD>CONjECTURES of the Land beyond the <HI>Apalataean</HI> Mountains.</HEAD>
<P>THey are certainly in a great errour, who imagine that the Continent of North-<HI>America</HI> is but eight or ten days journey over from the <HI>Atlantick</HI> to the <HI>Indian</HI> Ocean: which all rea&s;onable men mu&s;t acknowledge, if they con&s;i|der that Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> kept a We&s;t-Northwe&s;t cour&s;e from <HI>Cape Mendocino</HI> to <HI>California.</HI> Neverthele&s;s, by what I gathered from the &s;tranger Indians at <HI>Akenatzy</HI> of their Voyage by Sea to the very Mountains from a far di&s;tant Northwe&s;t Country, I am brought over to their opinion who think that the Indian Ocean does &s;tretch an Arm or Bay from <HI>California</HI> into the Continent as far as the <HI>Apala|taean</HI> Mountains, an&s;werable to the Gulfs of <HI>Florida</HI> and <HI>Mexico</HI> on this &s;ide. Yet I am far from believing with &s;ome, that &s;uch great and Navigable Rivers are to be found on the other &s;ide the <HI>Apalataeans</HI> falling into the Indian Ocean, as tho&s;e which run from them to the Ea&s;tward. My fir&s;t rea&s;on is derived from the knowledge and experience we already have of South-<HI>America,</HI> who&s;e <HI>Andes</HI> &s;end the greate&s;t Rivers in the world (as the <HI>Amazones</HI> and <HI>Rio de la Plata,</HI> &amp;c.) into the <HI>Atlantick,</HI> but none at all into the <HI>Pacifique</HI> Sea. Another Argument is, that all our Water|fowl which delight in Lakes and Rivers, as Swans, Gee&s;e,
<PB N="24" REF="18">Ducks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> come over the Mountains from the Lake of <HI>Canada,</HI> when it is frozen over every Winter, to our fre&s;h Rivers; which they would never do, could they finde any on the other &s;ide of the <HI>Apalataeans.</HI></P>

<HEAD>INSTRUCTIONS to &s;uch as &s;hall march upon Di&s;coveries into the North-<HI>American</HI> Continent.</HEAD>
<P>TWo breaches there are in the <HI>Apalataean</HI> Mountains, o|pening a pa&s;&s;age into the We&s;tern parts of the Conti|nent. One, as I am informed by Indians, at a place called <HI>Zynodoa,</HI> to the Norward; the other at <HI>Sara,</HI> where I have been my &s;elf: but the way thither being thorow a va&s;t Fo|re&s;t, where you &s;eldom fall into any Road or Path, you mu&s;t &s;hape your cour&s;e by a Compa&s;s; though &s;ome, for want of one, have taken their direction from the North-&s;ide of the trees, which is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t by quantities of thick Mo&s;s growing there. You will no meet with many hinderances on hor&s;eback in your pa&s;&s;age to the Mountains, but where your cour&s;e is interrupted by branches of the great Rivers, which in many places are not Fordable; and therefore if you be unprovided of means or &s;trength to make a Bridge by felling trees acro&s;s, you may be forced to go a great way about: in this re&s;pect company is nece&s;&s;ary, but in others &s;o inconvenient, that I would not advi&s;e a|bove half a dozen, or ten at the mo&s;t, to travel together; and of the&s;e, the major part Indians: for the Nations in your way are prone to jealou&s;ie and mi&s;chief towards Chri|&s;tians in a con&s;iderable Body, and as courteous and hearty to a few, from whom they apprehend no danger.</P>
<P>When you pa&s;s thorow an even level Country, where
<PB N="25" REF="18">you can take no particular remarks from hill or waters to guide your &s;elf by when you come back, you mu&s;t not forget to notch the trees as you go along with your &s;mall Hatchet, that in your return you may know when you fall into the &s;ame way which you went. By this means you will be certain of the place you are in, and may govern your cour&s;e homeward accordingly.</P>
<P>In &s;tead of Bread, I u&s;ed the meal of parched <HI>Mayz,</HI> i.e. Indian Wheat; which when I eat, I &s;ea&s;oned with a little Salt. This is both more portable and &s;trengthning then Bi&s;|cuit, and will &s;uffer no mouldine&s;s by any weather. For other provi&s;ions, you may &s;ecurely tru&s;t to your Gun, the Woods being full of Fallow, and <HI>Savanae</HI> of Red-Deer, be|&s;ides great variety of excellent Fowl, as wilde Turkeys, Pi|geons, Partridges, Phe&s;ants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But you mu&s;t not forget to dry or barbecue &s;ome of the&s;e before you come to the Mountains: for upon them you will meet with no Game, except a few Bears.</P>
<P>Such as cannot lie on the ground, mu&s;t be provided with light Hamacks, which hung in the trees, are more cool and plea&s;ant then any bed what&s;oever.</P>
<P>The Order and Di&s;cipline to be ob&s;erved in this Expedi|tion is, that an Indian Scout or two march as far before the re&s;t of the company as they can in &s;ight, both for the finding out provi&s;ion, and di&s;covery of Ambu&s;hes, if any &s;hould be laid by Enemies. Let your other Indians keep on the right and left hand, armed not onely with Guns, but Bills and Hatchets, to build &s;mall Arbours or Cottages of boughs and bark of trees, to &s;helter and defend you from the inju|ries of the weather. At nights it is nece&s;&s;ary to make great Fires round about the place where you take up your lodging, as well to &s;care Wild-bea&s;ts away, as to purifie the air. Neither mu&s;t you fail to go the Round at the clo&s;e of the evening: for then, and betimes in the morning, the In|dians put all their de&s;ignes in execution: in the night they never attempt any thing.</P>
<PB N="26" REF="19">
<P>When in the remote parts you draw near to an Indian Town, you mu&s;t by your Scouts inform your &s;elf whether they hold any corre&s;pondence with the <HI>Sa&s;que&s;ahanaughs:</HI> for to &s;uch you mu&s;t give notice of your approach by a Gun; which among&s;t other Indians is to be avoided, becau&s;e being ignorant of their u&s;e, it would affright and di&s;po&s;e them to &s;ome treacherous practice again&s;t you.</P>
<P>Being arrived at a Town, enter no hou&s;e until you are in|vited; and then &s;eem not afraid to be led in pinion'd like a pri&s;oner: for that is a Ceremony they u&s;e to friends and e|nemies without di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t accept of an invitation from the Seniors, be|fore that of young men; and refu&s;e nothing that is offered or &s;et afore you: for they are very jealous, and &s;en&s;ible of the lea&s;t &s;lighting or neglect from &s;trangers, and mindful of Revenge.</P>

<HEAD>Touching TRADE with Indians.</HEAD>
<P>IF you barely de&s;igne a Home-trade with neighbour-Indi|ans, for skins of Deer, Beaver, Otter, Wild-Cat, Fox, Racoon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> your be&s;t Truck is a &s;ort of cour&s;e Trading Cloth, of which a yard and a half makes a Matchcoat or Mantle fit for their wear; as al&s;o Axes, Hoes, Knives, Si|zars, and all &s;orts of edg'd tools. Guns, Powder and Shot, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are Commodities they will greedily barter for: but to &s;upply the Indians with Arms and Ammunition, is prohibited in all Engli&s;h Governments.</P>
<P>In dealing with the Indians, you mu&s;t be po&s;itive and at a word: for if they per&s;wade you to fall any thing in your price, they will &s;pend time in higgling for further abate|ments, and &s;eldom conclude any Bargain. Sometimes you
<PB N="27" REF="19">may with Brandy or Strong liquor di&s;po&s;e them to an hu|mour of giving you ten times the value of your commodi|ty; and at other times they are &s;o hide-bound, that they will not offer half the Market-price, e&s;pecially if they be a|ware that you have a de&s;igne to circumvent them with drink, or that they think you have a de&s;ire to their goods, which you mu&s;t &s;eem to &s;light and di&s;parage.</P>
<P>To the remoter Indians you mu&s;t carry other kinde of Truck, as &s;mall Looking-gla&s;&s;es, Pictures, Beads and Brace|lets of gla&s;s, Knives, Sizars, and all manner of gaudy toys and knacks for children, which are light and portable. For they are apt to admire &s;uch trinkets, and will purcha&s;e them at any rate, either with their currant Coyn of &s;mall &s;hells, which they call <HI>Roanoack</HI> or <HI>Peack,</HI> or perhaps with Pearl, Vermilion, pieces of Chri&s;tal; and towards <HI>&V;&s;hery,</HI> with &s;ome odde pieces of Plate or Buillon, which they &s;ometimes receive in Truck from the <HI>Oe&s;tacks.</HI></P>
<P>Could I have fore&s;een when I &s;et out, the advantages to be made by a Trade with tho&s;e remote Indians, I had gone better provided; though perhaps I might have run a great hazard of my life, had I purcha&s;ed con&s;iderably among&s;t them, by carrying wealth unguarded through &s;o many dif|ferent Nations of barbarous people: therefore it is vain for any man to propo&s;e to him&s;elf, or undertake a Trade at that di&s;tance, unle&s;s he goes with &s;trength to defend, as well as an Adventure to purcha&s;e &s;uch Commodities: for in &s;uch a de&s;igne many ought to joyn and go in company.</P>
<P>Some pieces of Silver unwrought I purcha&s;ed my &s;elf of the <HI>&V;&s;heries,</HI> for no other end then to ju&s;tifie this account I give of my Second Expedition, which had not determined at <HI>&V;&s;hery,</HI> were I accompanied with half a &s;core re&s;olute youths that would have &s;tuck to me in a further di&s;covery towards the Spani&s;h Mines.</P>
