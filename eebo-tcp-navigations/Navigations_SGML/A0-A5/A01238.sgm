<HEAD>The Declaration and Information of the high and pui&s;&s;ant King of BO|HEMIA, again&s;t the vniu&s;t Mandates publi&s;hed in the name of the Empe|rour; as al&s;o again&s;t tho&s;e that are fur|ther threatned to be decreed and exe|cuted, touching the Crowne of BO|HEMIA.</HEAD>
<P>_WE, <HI>Fredericke,</HI> by the grace of God, King of Bohemia, Count Palatine of the Rheine, and Prince Elector, Duke of Bauaria, Marquis of Morauia, Duke of Lut|zelburge and Sile&s;ia, Mar|quis of vpper and lower Lu|zatia, &amp;c. To all Chri&s;tian Potentates, Princes Electors, Princes, and States in generall, and to e|uery one of them in particular; as al&s;o to all others of what qualitie, &s;tate, or condition &s;o euer they be; make knowne our willing &s;eruice, friend&s;hip, and gracious will, giuing them hereby to vnder|&s;tand, that we haue beene certainly and mo&s;t truly informed, in what manner not long &s;ince, vnder the name of the Emperours Maie&s;tie, diuers ri|gorous, &amp; vnaccu&s;tomed Mandates and Patents, (to our mo&s;t great preiudice, defamation, and
<PB REF="3"> di&s;honour) haue beene here and there di&s;per&s;ed, as well within as without the Empire, and in &s;ome places publikely &s;et vp: Thereby vnder pretence of all manner of vntrue narrations and friuolous &s;ugge&s;tions, pretending, that our true and law|full Election vnto the Kingdome of Bohemia, made and performed by the generall vnanimous con&s;ent and agreement of the States of the &s;aid Kingdome of Bohemia, together with the Coun|tries thereunto incorporated, is vtterly void, and <HI>de facto,</HI> of no force, or of none effect. And withall affirming, that all the Princes, States, and Mem|bers of the Empire, (which hitherto out of a Chri|&s;tian compa&s;&s;ion, haue in any manner and by any meanes ayded and a&s;&s;i&s;ted the oppre&s;&s;ed Chri&s;ti|ans of the Kingdome of Bohemia and the incor|porated Countries thereunto annexed, inhumane|ly per&s;ecuted and mole&s;ted by extreame Tyran|nies, Murthers, Robberies, Burnings, and inno|cent bloud-&s;hedding) are by the &s;aid Declarati|ons, and Letters Pattents, vpon the auoiding of the actuall declaration and execution of the pains and penalties in that ca&s;e &s;et down and appointed by the Imperiall con&s;titutions, commanded and &s;trictly enioyned to leaue ayding and a&s;&s;i&s;ting of the &s;aid greatly per&s;ecuted and oppre&s;&s;ed Chri&s;ti|ans, and &s;pecially Vs, their now orderly elected and lawfully crowned King. And further, by mo&s;t friuolous vntrue and &s;landerous, imputations again&s;t vs, and with like &s;euere menacings, by Em|periall
<PB REF="3"> power, within a certaine time therein limi|ted and &s;et downe; commanding Vs, expre&s;&s;ely, without any delay, certainly, infallibly and actu|ally to abandon, leaue, and giue ouer our &s;aid Kingdome of Bohemia, and the Countries incor|porated thereunto, obtayned by &s;o iu&s;t and lawful a Title, and being in vndeniable iu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Now &s;etting apart that, which to the &s;lander and di&s;grace of the States of Bohemia, hath at large (though vntruly) beene publi&s;hed concer|ning the di&s;placing and remoouing of certaine vn|fit, peruer&s;e and turbulent Officers, alteration of Gouernment, and e&s;tabli&s;hing of Orders for the naturall defence and protection of their Subiects, whereunto by nature they are bound:</P>
<P>As al&s;o that, which for the confirmation of the pretended imaginary claime of Inheritance made by the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria to the &s;aid kingdome, may be, and is produced and obiected, out of the &s;len|der, in&s;ufficient and partiall Declaration made by the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the Fourth; concerning the free Election belonging to the Bohemians; as al|&s;o from that vnformal and di&s;orderly priuate te&s;ti|fication made by King <HI>Vladi&s;laus;</HI> and of that out of the Decree, &s;euen and fortie yeares &s;ince, by fire and &s;word compul&s;iuely extorted and wrung from the a&s;&s;embly of the States in Parliament at Prague; together with the ill alleaged ob&s;eruation of their pretended eight hundred yeares &s;ucce&s;&s;i|on. Sith that all the&s;e things haue beene fully an|&s;wered
<PB REF="4"> and confuted by the Apologies and dedu|ctarie Declarations made and publi&s;hed by the &s;aid States, with &s;uch truth and good ground, as that we thinke it needle&s;&s;e here to rehear&s;e or de|duce the &s;ame againe at large.</P>
<P>Only for the better and plainer iu&s;tification of our owne Per&s;on, we &s;ay that we doubt not, but that all men of indifferent and vnpa&s;&s;ionate minds, (that haue &s;eene and read our Declaration dated the twentieth of October (and &s;euenth of No|uember) publi&s;hed in Prague, and the Bohemian deduction therein mentioned and &s;et downe,) &s;uf|ficiently perceiue &amp; vnder&s;tand, vpon what mo&s;t vrgent and ineuitable rea&s;ons and motiues, after &s;o great and notorious nece&s;&s;ities, calamities, and mi&s;eries endured, and thereby inforced defence; the &s;aid States of the renowned Kingdome of Bohemia, together with the Prouinces incorpo|rated to the &s;ame, haue beene forced and compel|led vnto that wel-ordered abdication and reiecti|on, to them permitted both by the Lawes of God and man, and by vertue of their lawfull priuile|ges hitherto inuiolably maintained. And by what occa&s;ion wee for our parts haue beene mooued, and incited to accept of the &s;aid vacant Crowne, (vnexpected by vs, and without any thought of Ours) and lawfully ca&s;t vpon vs by a ioynt, free, and generall a&s;&s;emblie of the States of the King|dome of Bohemia, according to the ancient Pri|uileges and Freedome of Election re&s;erued vnto
<PB REF="4"> them by their fundamentall Lawes. As al&s;o that in the acceptation thereof wee neuer had any re|&s;pect to the further aduancement or increa&s;ing of our owne dignitie, and pre&s;ent particular profit, but chiefly and before all things to the glorie of God, the common wel-fare of our natiue Coun|trey, and as much as po&s;&s;ibly might bee, to the pre&s;eruation of this famous Kingdome, and Ele|ctorate Principalitie there, by ho&s;tile power and force almo&s;t vtterly &s;poyled and ruinated; withall hauing commi&s;eration and taking pitie vpon the mi&s;eries, &s;ighes, and lamentable teares which wee had before our eyes of &s;o many poore di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians. And therefore with our pure con&s;ci|ences we doe now againe te&s;tifie, that if by the re|fu&s;all of this Crowne then offered vnto vs, wee might haue beene a meanes that the deuouring fire of di&s;&s;ention rai&s;ed in the &s;aid Kingdome and the Territories thereof, (and &s;till more and more in|crea&s;ing) might haue beene quenched, the per&s;e|&s;ecution for Religion cea&s;&s;ed, their infringed Pri|uileges re&s;tored, the Countrey freed and &s;ecured from menaced bondage and &s;uppre&s;&s;ion, and the Empire al&s;o, and &s;pecially wee our &s;elues, and o|ther States bordering about vs, freed from appa|rant dangers: Wee would not only haue refu&s;ed the acceptation of the &s;aid Crowne offered vnto vs, but mo&s;t willingly haue employed our vtter|mo&s;t endeuour in that behalfe.</P>
<P>And wee hope, that no man to whom our acti|ons
<PB REF="5"> and proceedings, from and before the begin|ning of the&s;e troubles rai&s;ed in Bohemia, are knowne and made manife&s;t, can as well any waies doubt of our &s;inceritie, &s;eeing it is vndeniable, that we not onely particularly, but ioyntly al&s;o with other godly and true hearted Princes Ele|ctors, and Princes, pre&s;ently vpon their verie fir&s;t bur&s;ting out, as vpon the encrea&s;ing of this hurt|full fire, for the preuention of en&s;uing mi&s;chiefes, haue not &s;pared nor refu&s;ed to v&s;e any good meanes, nor to giue any true and vpright coun&s;ell therein. To the which end, at the la&s;t election day holden in Frankefort, by our fully authori&s;ed deputies, (together with the aduice and coun&s;ell of our fellow temporall Princes Electors) wee did mo&s;t faithfully and diligently labour, and gaue our aduice, to procure, that before wee handled or dealt in any other matter, the ho&s;tile troubles ray|&s;ed in the Empire, and &s;pecially in the Kingdome of Bohemia, might fir&s;t be brought and reduced to a peaceable and quiet State; for the effecting wherof, we wi&s;hed &amp; de&s;ired nothing more, then that the Amba&s;&s;adours of the States of Bohemia, then &s;ent to Frankefort, (which by our deputies was oftentimes moued) at their in&s;tant reque&s;t might haue beene admitted and heard, and not (as they were) &s;o contemptuou&s;ly reiected and put off.</P>
<P>And the electorall Records of the la&s;t procee|dings in the &s;aid Election at Franckfort, can wit|ne&s;&s;e,
<PB REF="5"> That our fully authori&s;ed deputies were as vnwilling vnto the &s;aid contumelious refu&s;all of the Bohemian Amba&s;&s;adours, as we were readie to the approuing and admi&s;&s;ion of his Imperiall Maie&s;tie (as King of Bohemia) into the electorall Colledge; but rather oftentimes haue prote&s;ted and declared, that wee by no meanes would dero|gate any thing from the liberties and rights of the States of the Crowne of Bohemia, nor thereby in any manner &s;eeke to prejudice either the one or the other.</P>
<P>Therefore, becau&s;e &s;uch good and faithfull ad|monitions, aduice, and prote&s;tations could take no effect, but to the contrarie, the &s;aid Amba&s;&s;a|dours of the States of Bohemia (again&s;t their an|cient nationall Lawes and Priuiledges) were con|&s;trained with great di&s;grace to goe home againe vnheard; their propo&s;itions &s;et downe in writing, not propounded nor read in the Electorall Col|ledge, nor yet the cau&s;e orderly and lawfully di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed and handled, (the Countrie in the meane time being &s;o grieuou&s;ly afflicted, by continuall and mo&s;t extreame ho&s;tilitie and deua&s;tation) as the like hath not beene heard of:</P>
<P>So that the interpo&s;ition then made and pro|pounded to the electorall Colledge (which not|with&s;tanding required much time, and in the meane while the Kingdome of Bohemia might haue beene vtterly &s;poyled and ouerthrowne) could not be brought to any effectuall treatie, nei|ther
<PB REF="6"> was by the contrary part earne&s;tly, nor with befitting zeale e&s;teemed of, nor con&s;idered vpon, as conueniently it ought to haue beene; but much rather, purpo&s;ely the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e was delayed, that &s;o in the meane time the Countrie might bee weakned and tyred out.</P>
<P>For the&s;e con&s;iderations, the States at that time a&s;&s;embled together in the Citie of Prague, beeing then in danger of falling into mo&s;t great extremi|tie and di&s;tre&s;&s;e, as al&s;o de&s;payring of any equall and impartiall redre&s;&s;e of that the contumelious reiection and refu&s;all of their &s;aid Amba&s;&s;adours; were con&s;trayned and forcibly compelled, to vn|dertake &s;ome other meanes (by vertue of their ancient and legall priuiledges) and to proceede to the lawfull alteration of the Crowne, as it is now knowne vnto the World: thereby to pre&s;erue and &s;aue them&s;elues from vtter ruine and final de|&s;tructions, as by their publique Apologies and De|ductions &s;et forth, and imprinted, doth &s;ufficiently and at large appeare.</P>
<P>From whence all men, yea al&s;o euerie &s;imple man, may ea&s;ily know and perceiue, That the cau&s;es and motiues, whereby the States of Bohe|mia, and the Prouinces thereinto incorporated, were enforced to this finall re&s;olution, are not in any manner to be a&s;cribed vnto vs, who&s;e care and indeuour &s;till was imployed by all the meanes that could be, to procure that peace, quietne&s;&s;e, and concord, might be againe reduced, and re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
<PB REF="6"> within the holy Empire; as al&s;o, that in the &s;aid Kingdome of Bohemia (as a &s;peciall and prin|cipall Electorall Principalitie) the troubles rai|&s;ed and begun, might be appea&s;ed, and the &s;ame reduced to a peaceable and quiet State: But much rather vnto tho&s;e, who at the verie beginning, (preferring force of armes before friendly means) at the afore&s;aid Electorall day, neglected, and re|iected all good coun&s;ell, admonition, and prote&s;ta|tions; &s;eeking all the meanes and waies they could, to aduance and effect that their &s;o long before pre|meditated intent and &s;ecret meaning.</P>
<P>And the proce&s;&s;e of the&s;e affaires manife&s;tly &s;hew, how little the contrarie part is and hath bin inclined to any peaceable cour&s;e of proceeding, as their actions &s;ufficiently te&s;tifie; and e&s;pecially hereby, in that we (at the beginning of our Regall gouernement) when occa&s;ion was motioned of entering into a peaceable treatie, willingly offered to yeeld thereunto. The &s;ame was notwith&s;tan|ding by them vtterly refu&s;ed and reiected.</P>
<P>And whereas it is imputed vnto vs, as if wee by our accepting and taking of the Crowne offered vnto vs, both orderly, and without all intru&s;ion, and (according to the ancient Lawes and funda|mentall Ordinances of the Kingdome of Bohe|mia, and their olde cu&s;tomes) by lawfull pre|cedent abdication altogether free and vacant) &s;hould thereby rebelliou&s;ly &amp; by force of armes, haue, of our owne actuall manner, vndertaken to
<PB REF="7"> pull away the &s;aid Kingdome and Prouinces incor|porated vnto the &s;ame, from his Imperiall Maie|&s;tie, contrarie to the common peace of the Em|pire: therein we finde our &s;elfe to be altogether ouer much wronged, and may in regard thereof, vndergoe and &s;tand vnto the cen&s;ure of all indiffe|rent per&s;ons, both within and without the Em|pire. For &s;eeing that by the fore-mentioned &s;eue|rall publi&s;hed deductorie Writings of the wor|thie Bohemian States, not onely their right and lawfull cau&s;es of vndertaken Reiection, but al&s;o their anciently de&s;cended, &amp; well grounded law|full Right of free Election: and that no man with equitie, nor vpon any good ground or &s;olid rea|&s;on, and iu&s;t foundation, can boa&s;t of any lawfull &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the &s;aid Realme; much le&s;&s;e by dan|gerous conuentions, ce&s;&s;ations, and tran&s;ports (wholly oppo&s;ite to the Fundamentall Lawes) made again&s;t and without the knowledge and con|&s;ent of the &s;aid States, tran&s;port the often fore&s;aid Kingdome of Bohemia, and proprietie of the Em|pire, and other the noble Countries, vnto any out-landi&s;h &s;trangers:</P>
<P>That all men may &s;ufficiently perceiue what great wrong and iniu&s;tice is offered thereby vnto vs, by proceeding again&s;t vs in &s;uch manner, who neuer &s;ought nor de&s;ired to wrong any one, nor take away again&s;t right from any man (of how meane e&s;tate &s;oeuer he were) any thing that be|longed vnto him.</P>
<PB REF="7">
<P>And although the Emperours Maie&s;tie within a &s;hort time after our Coronation, in an edict pub|li&s;hed before this latter <HI>Mandate,</HI> by diuers colou|rable circum&s;tances and allegations, hath taken vpon him, not onely to contradict, but altogether to annihilate and make void the afore&s;aid Reiecti|on, Election, and Coronation made, &amp; conferred vpon vs by the &s;aid States of the Crowne of Bo|hemia: Wee doubt not, but that euery man may ea&s;ily iudge, and di&s;cerne that his Maie&s;tie, (who in this cau&s;e touching the &s;aide States of Bohe|miaes Abdication or Reiection, and therupon en|&s;uing Election and Coronation, pre&s;umeth vpon certaine &s;uppo&s;itions, and pretences of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, being but a partie plaintife) is not for him&s;elfe to iudge, whether the States of Bohemia haue herein done lawfully, and according to their ancient Lawes and priuiledges; and &s;o whether the new Election be in force, and of &s;ufficiencie, or not: nor can he be warranted by any Law, or vnder any colour of ab&s;olute Imperial authority, power, and Soueraigntie, to aduance and pre&s;&s;e thorow the priuate de&s;&s;ignes and particular Au|&s;trian pretences, with peremptory proce&s;&s;e of exe|cution, &amp; by his own power to make him&s;elf iudge in his own cau&s;e, contrarie to all the Laws &amp; Or|dinances of the Empire; no more then the decea&s;|&s;ed Emperours <HI>Frederick, Charles, Rodulph,</HI> and others, in their owne particular controuer&s;ies, and pretences again&s;t any of the States of the Empire,
<PB REF="8"> did euer vndertake and a&s;&s;ume vnto them&s;elues, to be both Iudges and parties.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this; The States of the Crowne of Bo|hemia, and the prouinces incorporated to the &s;ame, acknowledge not any iuri&s;diction or Supe|rioritie in the Emperor, in or ouer the Kingdome, (excepting that which concerneth the Feudarie Lands had from the holy Empire) becau&s;e they are not &s;ubiect to the Romaine Emperour, nor to any of the holy Empires cen&s;urers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note this well.</NOTE> either at the Imperiall Court, nor in the Chamber at Spires; nor al&s;o to any other con&s;titutions of the Empire, nor A&s;&s;emblings and common decidings, decrees, Tracts, and deci&s;ions of the Empire, but haue their owne ancient Countrie Lawes, Priuiledges, Ordi|nances, Exemptions, and Cu&s;tomes, whereby they are gouerned.</P>
<P>Whereby it ea&s;ily appeareth, how vn&s;ea&s;ona|bly and without rea&s;on, the Emperours priuie Councell in this priuate bu&s;ine&s;&s;e arrogate again&s;t vs vnto them&s;elues the office of Iudges, whereun|to in regard of their Per&s;ons or Qualities they are not called; nor by the temporall Princes Electors, and other Princes, are acknowledged or deemed to be &s;uch as are worthie, of their owne authoritie to a&s;&s;ume &s;uch Princes power, as by &s;uch vnfit and di&s;ordered proces, of no force nor validitie, to pro|ceede again&s;t a King, and a Prince Elector.</P>
<P>But if his Imperiall Maie&s;tie, as Archduke of Au&s;tria, be re&s;olued orderly and by due cour&s;e of
<PB REF="8"> Law to pro&s;ecute and produce his pretended heredi|tarie claime to the Crowne of Bohemia, then he ought not to doe it before his owne priuie Councel and &s;er|uants,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A poynt verie ob|&s;eruable.</NOTE> but (according to the Lawes and Priuiledges of the Crowne of Bohemia) before their owne Iudges, vnto whom &s;uch high and weightie cau&s;es doe ap|pertaine, and mu&s;t as plaintife and actor <HI>Forum rei,</HI> &s;ue and follow the &s;ame, before them, and according to the Ordinances of the generall Common Law: as on the other &s;ide, if as Emperour of Rome, hee be &s;u|ed by order of Law, by any other, according to the golden Bull of <HI>Charles</HI> the Fourth, hee ought to ap|peare, plead, and an&s;wer before a Pal&s;graue &amp; Prince Elector; and therefore neither can nor ought to be his owne Iudge. As now it is to be hoped, that no impar|tiall per&s;on what&s;oeuer may any waies doubt of the in&s;ufficiencie and manife&s;t nullitie of the afore&s;aide pretended Imperiall Edict of ca&s;&s;ation: So likewi&s;e, we are fully per&s;waded, that from the &s;ame or the like grounds, no man will nor can, but hold and e&s;teeme the alreadie thereupon en&s;ued Imperiall rigorous mandates; as al&s;o all &s;uch others which are threatned, as may hereafter follow, and be made again&s;t vs, or o|thers, either belonging vnto vs, or aiding of vs; to bee void and of none effect (as in verie truth of them&s;elues they are) and which we (as occa&s;ion &s;erueth, and our nece&s;&s;itie requireth) are determined in all euents as is lawfully permitted vnto vs, to with&s;ta~d &amp; repugne; in as much as the &s;aid proceedings deriued from a pa&s;&s;ionate minde, and concerning his owne priuate pretended right, are done without any lawfull exami|nation
<PB REF="9"> or knowledge of the cau&s;e, and then &s;pecially when his Maie&s;tie hath alreadie hitherto cho&s;en ano|ther cour&s;e by force of armes, and therein hath not o|mitted any kind of ho&s;tilitie what&s;oeuer; &amp; whereby he hath directly not onely proceeded contrarie to the common Lawes of all Nations, but al&s;o again&s;t the good and profitable Con&s;titutions of the Empire, and the Sacred corporall Oath ratified by Imperiall Ca|pitulation, whereunto his Maie&s;tie al&s;o hath bound and obliged him&s;elfe, in the&s;e words following:</P>
<P>That neither he, nor any other for him, or in his name or behalfe, will or &s;hall, by violence or force, mole&s;t or trouble any of the Princes Electors, Prin|ces, Prelates, Earles, Barons, nor other States of the Empire, in any manner: But that, if his Imperiall Ma|ie&s;tie him&s;elfe, or any other particular per&s;on, hath right or cau&s;e to demand or &s;ue for any thing of them all in generall, or of any of them in particular (for the auoyding and preuenting of all di&s;&s;entions, troubles, and other inconueniences in the Empire, thereby to pre&s;erue and maintaine peace and vnitie) he will and &s;hall proceede by lawfull order and proce&s;&s;e; and in &s;uch ca&s;es, where hee or they may haue iu&s;tice by Law, be willing to &s;ubmit them&s;elues thereunto: and will by no meanes, nor vnder any pretence what&s;oe|uer, permit nor &s;uffer them to be mole&s;ted, hurt, or inuaded by warre, burning, defiances, or any other manner of ho&s;tilitie what&s;oeuer. That his Maie&s;tie al&s;o &s;hall fore&s;ee, and hereafter by no meanes &s;uffer nor permit, that any of the States, of high or low de|gree, Princes Electors, Princes, or any others, &s;hall
<PB REF="9"> without iu&s;t cau&s;e and lawfull audience, wrongfully be proclaimed or declared guiltie of pro&s;cription and bani&s;hment: But that all ca&s;es &s;hall bee proceeded in according to the ordinarie proce&s;&s;e, and the holy Ro|mane Empires Lawes e&s;tabli&s;hed, to the direction of the Lawes of the holy Empire, and the reformed or|der held in the Imperiall Chamber, and agreeably be fully and &s;trictly ob&s;erued and followed.</P>
<P>And then la&s;tly, that his Maie&s;tie (contrary to the golden Bull, and other Lawes and Ordinances of the holy Empire) &s;hall not in any manner, nor by any meanes, of his owne authoritie, &s;end out any Re&s;cript, Mandate, or other preiudiciall Commi&s;&s;ion, nor by way of entreatie procure the &s;ame from any other magi&s;trate what&s;oeuer: with this expre&s;&s;e clau&s;e, That if any thing repugnant to the afore&s;aid Articles and &s;peciall points, be either obtained, or &s;ent forth, that the &s;ame &s;hall be in all re&s;pects wholly fru&s;trate, void, and of no force at all.</P>
<P>As therefore in this pre&s;ent difference, wherein We now are at controuer&s;ie with the Emperous Maie&s;tie, concerning the priuate particular pretence which hee maketh (as Archduke of Au&s;tria) vnto our lawfully po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Kingdome of Bohemia, and the Prouinces incorporated thereunto, We are not as yet at all &s;um|moned by ordinarie cour&s;e of Law, to appeare, which We are readie and willing to doe and performe, &s;o it be in an indifferent and conuenient place, and before vnpartiall Iudges (according to the priuiledges of Bohemia:) So no man can nor ought to think hard|ly of Vs, for refu&s;ing to obey the Imperiall Monitorie
<PB REF="10"> Mandate, publi&s;hed and &s;ent forth again&s;t Vs, bearing date the 30. of Aprill la&s;t pa&s;t; as being wholly oppo|&s;ite and contrarie to all the Lawes and Ordinances of the Empire, and which al&s;o is by vertue of the afore|&s;aid Imperiall Capitulation, and the golden Bull, of it &s;elfe fru&s;trate, void, and of none effect at all.</P>
<P>And Wee al&s;o hope, that other States and fellow-members of the Empire (that haue not as yet openly &s;ubmitted them&s;elues vnto the Spani&s;h &s;eruitude, or that haue not betaken them&s;elues vnto the &s;eruice of that Hou&s;e,) wil not be moued by the &s;aid Imperiall Mandate to them directed (which for the rea&s;ons a|fore&s;aid is of no force) to de&s;i&s;t from their mo&s;t com|mendable intents and purpo&s;es, which hitherto they haue had, for the glorie of God, and the comfort and con&s;olation of &s;o many poore Chri&s;tians wrongfully oppre&s;&s;ed. And the rather, for that we are per&s;waded no man of vnder&s;tanding that is not led by vntimely immoderate affection, or blinded with priuate con&s;i|derations &amp; imaginarie re&s;pects, can iudge or cen&s;ure, that Wee or Our a&s;&s;i&s;tants haue in the lea&s;t re&s;pect done any thing contrarie to the Con&s;titutions of the Empire, by means of this our firme re&s;olution, which We haue bin, and are forced to take again&s;t the Em|perours Maie&s;tie; not as he is Romane Emperour, (for in that re&s;pect We neither doe, nor will derogate any thing from him, but rather, according to the Imperi|all Lawes, in all things duely honour and re&s;pect him) but as Archduke of Au&s;tria, in regard of his pretended particular and priuate pretences. And therefore, that neither by law nor equitie doe the penalties &s;et down
<PB REF="10"> in the &s;aid actuall peremptorie menacing Declaration and Execution, (as grounded vpon the Con&s;titutions of the Empire) belong vnto Vs, and &s;o much the le&s;&s;e, &s;eeing they pretend, that the hitherunto attempted &amp; the hereafter further threatned proce&s;&s;e, is groun|ded vpon the Empires Con&s;titutions, which yet are not by Vs at all: but much rather by them of the o|ther part, cleane laid a&s;ide, and wholly neglected; yea, and in &s;uch manner &s;o ouer&s;tridden and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, and with &s;uch vnheard of cruell in&s;olencies, by the forraigne barbarous &s;ouldiers who are brought in; as that the inforced Defence and Deliuerance permitted by all Lawes Naturall and Nationall, neither can nor ought by any the like &s;urmi&s;e and colour of Lawe, or other pretended ground of Rea&s;on what&s;oeuer, be drawne and taken at all away from the oppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>And if yet his Imperiall Maie&s;tie (beyond all ex|pectation) &s;hall &s;till &s;uffer him&s;elfe to be &s;o far tran&s;|ported and carried away, as that (not regarding nor re&s;pecting the precious Oath he hath taken) in re&s;pect of the claim he pretends (again&s;t Vs) to Our Crowne of Bohemia, and the Prouinces thereunto incorpora|ted; continually to mole&s;t and grieue Vs, our friends, and Allies, with intimated proce&s;&s;e of Pro&s;cription <HI>(ex authoritate propria)</HI> and of him&s;elfe actually pro|ceede &s;o farre, e&s;pecially as in ho&s;tile manner, to in|uade our hereditarie Countries and Territories, and by that meanes (as he hath already done, and yet con|tinueth to doe, both in the Kingdome of Bohemia, and the neighbouring confines thereof) occa&s;ion new commotions, di&s;tractions, diui&s;ions, and alterations in
<PB REF="11"> other places of the Empire, and thereby (as much as in him lyeth) &s;eeke to &s;ubuert &amp; ouerthrow the publike peace of the &s;aid Empire: We mu&s;t indeed then with patience commit our Cau&s;e vnto God the highe&s;t Iudge, with a&s;&s;ured confidence, that as hitherto Wee haue palpably felt and &s;eene his great and wonderfull prouidence, and mightie out-&s;tretched arme extended towards Vs, &s;o We hope that his diuine Omnipotence will al&s;o not hereafter for&s;ake nor abandon Vs, but fatherly affoord vnto Vs &s;uch meanes, that, by his powerfull a&s;&s;i&s;tance, We may be able to defend Our &s;elfe and Our right, again&s;t &s;o vnlawfull wrongs, and vnexpected barbarous attempts. And hereby We doe expre&s;&s;ely and in the be&s;t manner that Wee may or can, truly prote&s;t, both before God and man, that if, by further menacings, and vnlawfull &s;euere pro|ce&s;&s;es of Execution, a generall fire of wars (which our good GOD graciou&s;ly auert) &s;hall be kindled in Our natiue Countrie of Germanie (as is to be feared) that then the calamities and mi&s;eries that thereby may en|&s;ue, &s;hall not in any wi&s;e be laid vpon, nor imputed vnto Vs; but vnto tho&s;e Coun&s;ellors, and Seruants, that haue not onely neglected to put his Imperiall Maie&s;tie in remembrance of the Capitulation where|unto Hee hath &s;worne (as by duty they were bound) but al&s;o for their owne benefit, particular commodi|tie, and imaginarie greatne&s;&s;e in the Countrie of Bo|hemia, and out of a reuengefull de&s;ire, haue mini&s;tred &s;uch means as in many particulars are directly again&s;t the afore&s;aid Capitulation, and the common peace and tranquillitie of the whole Countrie.</P>
<PB REF="11">
<P>And this We thought expedient (as al&s;o our nece&s;|&s;itie requireth) to giue notice of vnto euerie one; ve|rily hoping, that no man (who fauoureth rea&s;on, truth, and equitie) vpon the &s;ight of this Our mo&s;t true Information, can or will bee moued to cen&s;ure badly of Vs, or to di&s;ta&s;te Our Actions, in regard of his Maie&s;ties friuolous Mandate (repugnant to Lawe and the Imperiall Capitulation) publi&s;hed and &s;ent forth again&s;t Vs, Our friends, Allies, and adherents, in regard of this controuer&s;ie that Wee haue with his Maie&s;tie, as Archduke of Au&s;tria: nor &s;uffer any taxa|tions towards the performance of the execution of &s;uch priuat pretences, to be laid or louied vpon them; which the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria it &s;elfe, did neuer hereto|fore re&s;pect nor account of, nor yet euer did any thing or contributed in the like ca&s;es of Execution, but did euer, and vpon all occa&s;ions, wholly exempt and free them&s;elues from the &s;ame.</P>
<P>In regard whereof, the Princes Electors, Princes, and States of the Empire, at this time, haue le&s;&s;e cau&s;e to trouble and to burthen them&s;elues therewith on the behalfe of the &s;aid Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, again&s;t Vs; but on the contrarie, to be readie and willing, if We or Ours, in manner afore&s;aid, &s;hall be a&s;&s;aulted and inuaded, to aide and a&s;&s;i&s;t Vs with their aduice and meanes, and according to the Order of Executions, (which Wee euer, and at all times, haue duely re&s;pe|cted and ob&s;erued;) and &s;o much the rather, to afford Vs their helpe, for that euery particular Grant, Tract, and State of the Empire, ought, and is reciprocally
