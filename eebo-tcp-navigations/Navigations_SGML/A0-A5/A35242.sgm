<P>THis Relation comming to my Hands, I thought it might be &s;ome Diver&s;ion, to Ob&s;erve what the Ig|norant are made to Believe, of tho&s;e once Famous Places.</P>
<P>And though others have for|merly Treated of the&s;e Parts, yet we have hardly had an Exact Account &s;ince Mr. <HI>Sandys,</HI> which being &s;o long &s;ince, No doubt &s;ome things are Altered, &s;ome Worn out of Memory, and it may be, many more <HI>Legends</HI> Added, Ac|cording as it may &s;tand with the Intere&s;t and Profit of the Prie&s;ts.</P>

If the Stile be not &s;o Polite and Curious, as might be Wi&s;ht, I dare A&s;&s;ure the Reader that the Author never intended it for Pub|like Veiw, but Writ it only as a Letter, to &s;atisfy the de&s;ire of his Intimate Friends; wherein Men do not commonly &s;o much Study Elloquence, as plaine&s;s and Truth; The la&s;t whereof I Suppo&s;e the Author is Guilty of, becau&s;e he had no Temptation to do Other|wi&s;e; for I think it is not much Material to him, whether it be Be|lieved or noe.

<HEAD>A Brief De&s;cription of <HI>Pale&s;tine,</HI> with an Ac|count of the Ancient and Modern State of tho&s;e Countries.</HEAD>
<P>_IN Former Ages, this was One of the mo&s;t Famou&s;|e&s;t Provinces of <HI>Sy|ria:</HI> Called,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, The Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> from <HI>Canaan</HI> the Son of <HI>Cham,</HI> who by his often Cha|&s;ings
<PB REF="6">was driven to Po&s;&s;e&s;s and Inhabite the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Secondly, It was called the <HI>Land of Promi&s;e,</HI> becau&s;e the Lord had Promi&s;ed it to the Pa|triarcks, <HI>Abraham, I&s;aack</HI> and <HI>Ja|cob,</HI> and their Seed.</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>J&s;rael,</HI> of the <HI>I&s;rae|lites,</HI> &s;o called from <HI>Jacob,</HI> who was Sur-named <HI>I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, <HI>Judea,</HI> from the <HI>Jews,</HI> or People of the Tribe of <HI>Juda.</HI></P>
<P>Fifthly, <HI>Pale&s;tine,</HI> by <HI>Ptolo|mays</HI> and others, <HI>qua&s;i Phili&s;tini:</HI> The Land of the <HI>Phili&s;tines,</HI> a potent Nation that dwelt there.</P>
<P>Sixthly, The Holy Land, &s;o Na|med by the Chri&s;tians, becau&s;e herein was Wrought by <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> the Work of our Salvation.</P>
<P>This Country is Situated in
<PB REF="6">the mid&s;t of the World, Be|tween the Third and Fourth Cli|mates, the longe&s;t Day being Fourteen Hours and a quarter, be|tween the <HI>Midland Sea</HI> and <HI>A|rabia,</HI> from which it is Bulwar|ked beyond <HI>Jordan</HI> with a con|tinual Ridg of Mountaines; on the Ea&s;t lyes <HI>Celo&s;goia,</HI> and <HI>A|rabia Petrea;</HI> on the South <HI>Idu|mea,</HI> the Wilderne&s;s of <HI>Pharam</HI> and <HI>Egypt;</HI> in the We&s;t a part of <HI>Phenicia,</HI> and the re&s;t, hath the <HI>Mediterranean-Sea;</HI> and on the North are the Mountaines of <HI>Libanus,</HI> and a part of <HI>Pheni|cia:</HI> It is di&s;tant from the Equi|noctial Thirty one Degrees, exten|ding to Thirty Three; &s;o that in length from <HI>Dan</HI> unto <HI>Ber&s;heba,</HI> it containeth not more then Four Hundred Miles; and where
<PB REF="7">it is Broade&s;t, not Fifty.</P>
<P>This Famous Land was once commended above all Coun|tries under the Sun, e&s;pecial|ly in regard of the Salubritie and Whol&s;omene&s;s of the Ayr, being Seated under a Tempe|rate Clime, where the Win|ter is not too Cold, nor the Summer too Hot; and for Fer|tility, a Land that Floweth with Milk and Hony, Adorned with Beautified Mountaines, and de|lightful Valleys; the Rock pro|ducing Excellent Waters, and no part empty of Delight or Profit; for the Soyle yeilds abundance of all Fruits and In|crea&s;e.</P>
<P>This Land aboundeth in &s;weet Springs, and plea&s;ant Pa&s;tures; where they feed a great many
<PB REF="7">Flocks of Sheep, and herds of Cattle and Cowes which give excellent Milk as is in any Country in the World; There is al&s;o brave Hunting and Hawking; for Deere, Goats, Hares, Partridges, Quailes, and other Birds: Likewi&s;e, they have all kind of Fowle, al&s;o there are great &s;tore of Lyons, Beares and Wolves, found in Abundance.</P>
<P>The Land of <HI>Canaan</HI> was heretofore divided into Thirty Kingdomes, and Kings when the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> Conquered it; the mo&s;t of the Ancient inhabitants being for their Sins by God Ex|cluded the Land, and put to the Sword by the <HI>I&s;raelites:</HI> The <HI>I&s;|raelites</HI> Ruled this Land, about Foure Hundred Years, by Prin|ces and Judges, till the time of
<PB REF="8"><HI>Samuel:</HI> The&s;e Princes or Judges, were not all of one Tribe, but the Be&s;t, Grave&s;t, and Elde&s;t, were Selected, and Cho&s;en out of every Tribe. Afterwards the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> growing weary of this Government, at their Earne&s;t re|que&s;t, the Lord appointed them a King, and &s;o their Government was Changed into a <HI>Monarchie,</HI> which continued many Ages; but in proce&s;s of time, the <HI>I&s;rae|lites</HI> endured many Mi&s;eries, and Afflictions, till at la&s;t they &s;aw the utter Ruine and &s;ubvertion of their Kingdome.</P>
<P>What Alteration hapened to this Nation, and with how ma|ny &s;everal Wars they were Pla|gued (either becau&s;e of their own &s;tifneckedne&s;s, that they would not be Obedient to their
<PB REF="8">own Prince, or brook any for|reign Government, or that for their Rebellion and Sins, the Wrath of God was oftentimes Kindled again&s;t them; or that Forreigne Princes were Ambi|tious to Incorporate this happy Land, Holy Writ and <HI>Hi&s;tori|graphers</HI> Witne&s;s the &s;ame at large; for how many times were they Subdued and brought into Slavary, and Bondage, becau&s;e of their Sins, and that they did not Govern and behave them&s;elves well? for &s;ometimes their Necks were brought under the Yoakes of their Neighbours, as the <HI>E|gyptians, Caldeans, Meads, Per|&s;ians, Macedonians</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> yea, and would never cea&s;e by their Rebellions, Seditions, and Con&s;piracies, till they had
<PB REF="9">brought their Government and Countrey to utter De&s;truction, by Per&s;ecuting and putting to Death, the Saints and Prophets, &s;ent them from God; yea, and at la&s;t Crucifying the Son of God, the Lord of Glory, and the Saviour of Man-kind, by their Horrible and Murderous Hands, and Nailing him to the Cro&s;s.</P>
<P>And finally, wi&s;hing that his In|nocent Bloud &s;hould be on them and their Children;</P>
<P>Which accordingly &s;oon after happened to the utter De&s;olation of their Countrey, the <HI>Romans</HI> laying wa&s;t, and levelling to the Ground, the Magnificent Struct|ures and Buildings thereof, de|&s;troying and burning <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> the Temple, and all the Orna|ments
<PB REF="9">thereof; &s;o that herein was verified the Prophecy of Chri&s;t while he was upon the Earth, <HI>that one Stone &s;hould not be left upon Another.</HI></P>
<P>And as for the People, Di|vine Venegance did continually pur&s;ue them till the mo&s;t part of them were de&s;troyed, and the re&s;t Di&s;per&s;ed through out the World, even to this Day.</P>
<P>For Fir&s;t, The Inhabitants of <HI>Ce&s;area</HI> &s;lew of the <HI>Jews</HI> in one Day, about Twenty Thou&s;and, and &s;uch as fled, were taken and Impri&s;oned by <HI>Florus</HI> the Leiu|tenant of <HI>Judea.</HI></P>
<P>To Revenge this Slaughter, the <HI>Jews</HI> &s;et upon the <HI>Syrians;</HI> in which Skirmi&s;h Thirteen Thou|&s;and of them were Slain. The People of <HI>Alexandria</HI> put Fifty
<PB REF="10">Thou&s;and of them to the Sword; They of <HI>Dama&s;cus</HI> ten Thou&s;and of them: and <HI>Antonius</HI> a <HI>Roman</HI> Captain, &s;lew in <HI>A&s;calon</HI> Ten Thou&s;and; and <HI>Ce&s;tius</HI> another Captain, &s;lew Four&s;core Thou|&s;and and Forty Per&s;ons. And now to come to the Wars man|naged here by <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ion,</HI> in the Seige of <HI>Aphaca,</HI> &s;lew and took Pri&s;oners Seventeen Thou&s;and, One Hun|dred and Thirty Per&s;ons: in <HI>Sama|ria</HI> Eleaven Thou&s;and Six Hun|dred Per&s;ons: and in <HI>Jo&s;epata</HI> Forty two Thou&s;and two Hun|dred Per&s;ons. In <HI>Joppa</HI> &s;o ma|ny Killed and Drowned them|&s;elves, that the Sea threw up again Four Thou&s;and two Hundred Per|&s;ons; and the re&s;t &s;o totally pe|ri&s;hed, that there remained none
<PB REF="10">to carry tydings to <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> of the lo&s;s of the Town.</P>
<P>In the City of <HI>Tarichea,</HI> were Slain and made Captives, Forty five Thou&s;and Per&s;ons, be&s;ides tho&s;e which were given to the King <HI>Agrippa:</HI> In <HI>Gamala</HI> there peri&s;h|ed Ninety Thou&s;and, and none were left alive but only two Wo|men. In <HI>Ga&s;cala</HI> Five Thou&s;and Men died by the Sword. In the City of <HI>Gadara,</HI> there were Slain Thirty two Thou&s;and two Hun|dred, be&s;ides an infinite number of &s;uch as Drowned them&s;elves. In <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> it &s;elf, there Died Eleven Hundred Thou&s;and of them, partly by the Sword, and partly by Famine, the wor&s;e E|nemy of the two; there were found two Thou&s;and in Privies and Sinks; and Ninety Seaven
<PB REF="11">Thou&s;and were taken pri&s;oners, in&s;omuch, that thirty <HI>Jews</HI> were &s;old for a Peny.</P>
<P>Now that <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> was able to contain &s;uch a number of Peo|ple, is evident, in that when <HI>Ce&s;tius</HI> was Leiuetenant of <HI>Jury,</HI> the high Prie&s;t did, at his Re|que&s;t, number the People, which came to Eat of the <HI>Pa&s;chal</HI> Lamb, and found them to be two Mil|lions, and Seven Hundred Thou|&s;and living Souls, all Sound and Purified.</P>
<P>And when <HI>Titus</HI> laid Seige to the City, it was at the Fea&s;t of the Pa&s;&s;eover, when mo&s;t of the People were there A&s;&s;embled; God as it were thus Impri&s;oning them.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Ma&s;&s;acres, be&s;ides di|vers others Omitted, and infinite
<PB REF="11">Numbers which were Slain in the Feilds and Villages, which Drow|ned them&s;elves, and were pri|vately made away, Amounting to almo&s;t two Millions of Peo|ple, happened in the compa&s;s of foure Years, beginning in the twel&s;e of <HI>Nero,</HI> and ending in the &s;econd of <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian.</HI></P>
<P>Yet was not the whole Nati|on Rooted out till the Year One Hundred Thirty Six. For then this Mi&s;erable People having &s;tir|red two notable Rebellions, Fir&s;t under <HI>Trajan,</HI> and a&s;terward under <HI>Adrian</HI> the Emperours, they were generally Bani&s;hed their Native Countrey, and never again &s;uf|fered to inhabit it, but as Stran|gers.</P>
<P>After this De&s;olation, the <HI>Jews</HI> were di&s;per&s;ed all over the World,
<PB REF="12">and e&s;pecially in <HI>Spain,</HI> where <HI>Adrian</HI> Commanded many of them to dwell; yet they found every where &s;o little Favour, that having divers times been put to greivous Mulcts and Ran&s;omes, they were at la&s;t quite t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ru&s;t out of <HI>Europe</HI> al&s;o.</P>
<P>The Fir&s;t Chri&s;tian Prince that expelled the <HI>Jews</HI> out of his Territories, was that Heroick King, our <HI>Edward</HI> the Fir&s;t, who was &s;uch a &s;ore Scowrge al&s;o to the <HI>Scots;</HI> and it is thought, di|vers Families of tho&s;e Bani&s;hed <HI>Jews</HI> fled then to <HI>Scotland,</HI> where they have propagated &s;ince in great Numbers; Witne&s;s the A|ver&s;ion this Nation hath above others to Hogs-Fle&s;h.</P>
<P>Nor was this their Extermi|nation for their Religion, but for
<PB REF="12">their notorious Crimes; as poi|&s;oning of Wells, Counterfeiting of Coins, fal&s;ifying of Seals, and Crucifying of Chri&s;tian Chil|dren; with other Villanies. This happened in the Year One Thou|&s;and Two Hundred Ninety One.</P>
<P>And Sixteen Years after, <HI>France</HI> followed our Example.</P>
<P>It was neer two Hundred Years after, that <HI>Ferdinand</HI> turn'd them out of <HI>Spain;</HI> and five years after him, <HI>Emanual</HI> of <HI>Por|tugal</HI> did the like.</P>
<P>But the Countreys from whence they were La&s;t expelled, were <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Sicily,</HI> in the Year One Thou&s;and Five Hundred Thirty Nine. In other parts of Chri|&s;tendome they re&s;ide yet, in great numbers, as in <HI>Germany</HI> High and Low; <HI>Bohemia, Lituania,
<PB REF="13">Poland</HI> and <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia;</HI> In <HI>Italy</HI> al&s;o they are found, but in no Coun|trey which is &s;ubject to the King of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>They live very quietly at <HI>Rome</HI> under the Popes no&s;e, and St. <HI>Mark</HI> makes no Scruple to entertain them at <HI>Venice:</HI> In &s;un|dry places of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire they are found very numerous; &s;o that it is thought <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople</HI> and <HI>The&s;&s;alonica</HI> only, have near upon twenty Thou&s;and of them.</P>
<P><HI>A&s;ia</HI> is full of them, as <HI>Aleppo, Tripoly, Dama&s;cus, Rhodes,</HI> and in|deed all places of commerce and Traffique; There are numbers of themifound al&s;o in <HI>Per&s;ia, Arabia,</HI> and about <HI>Cranganor</HI> in <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P>And to come to <HI>Affrick,</HI> they have their Synagogues and Lum|bards
<PB REF="13">bards, in <HI>Alexandria,</HI> the <HI>Gran Cairo,</HI> as al&s;o in <HI>Fe&s;&s;e,</HI> in <HI>Tre|mi&s;eu,</HI> and divers places in the Kingdome of <HI>Morocco:</HI> there are about one hundred Families left in <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> But the place where they are mo&s;t unmingled, is <HI>Tibe|rias,</HI> which the <HI>Turks</HI> gave to <HI>Mendez</HI> the <HI>Jew,</HI> for &s;ome &s;ignal &s;ervices; thither they oftentimes bring or &s;end the bones of their dead freinds, who have left large Legacies to be there interred from other places.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> was af|terward re-edified by <HI>Elius A|drianus,</HI> and given to the Chri&s;ti|ans, from whom it was taken by <HI>Co&s;roes,</HI> and the <HI>Pre&s;ians,</HI> in the Year Six Hundred Fifteen, and from them forcibly wre&s;ted by <HI>Hau|mar,</HI> and the <HI>Saracens,</HI> in the Year
<PB REF="14">Six Hundred Thirty Seven. Next it fell into the power of <HI>Cutlu Mo&s;es,</HI> and the <HI>Turks,</HI> in the Year One Thou&s;and Nine; under who&s;e oppre&s;&s;ion, when it had long groa|ned, <HI>Peter</HI> the Hermit &s;tirred up the <HI>We&s;terne</HI> Princes to relieve the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians, who&s;e de&s;igns attained their wi&s;hed effect, under the Banner of the Victorious Prince, <HI>Godfrey</HI> of <HI>Bullen,</HI> in the Year One Thou&s;and Ninety Nine. This <HI>Godfrey,</HI> for his merits, was to have been inve&s;ted with the Royal Wreath of Maje&s;ty, which he denied, thinking it unfit to wear a Crown of Gold, where his Saviour had Worn a Crown of Thorns; yet for the Common good &s;ake he accepted the Title; after whom
<PB REF="14">reigned the&s;e Chri&s;tian Prin|ces.</P>
<P>Second, <HI>Baldwin.</HI> Third, <HI>Baldwin</HI> the Second. Fourth, <HI>Fulk</HI> Earl of <HI>Anjou.</HI> Fifth, <HI>Bald|win</HI> the Third. Six, <HI>Almerick.</HI> Seventh, <HI>Baldwin</HI> the Fourth. Eight, <HI>Baldwin</HI> the fifth. Ninth, <HI>Guy</HI> of <HI>Lu&s;ignan,</HI> the la&s;t King of <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> during who&s;e time, <HI>Saladine</HI> the Sultan of <HI>Egypt,</HI> won the Kingdom, which his Succe&s;&s;ours defended again&s;t all inva&s;ions, till the Year One Thou&s;and Five Hundred Seven|teen, when <HI>Selinus</HI> the fir&s;t Em|perour of the <HI>Turks,</HI> added the Holy <HI>Land</HI> together with <HI>Egypt</HI> to his Empire: And &s;o the whole Countrey of <HI>Pale&s;tine,</HI> with the City of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> are under the dominion of the <HI>Turk</HI> to this
<PB REF="15">day, and is inhabited by &s;ome <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> (who make a great benefit of &s;hewing the Sepulcher of Chri&s;t) and of late Years al&s;o, by <HI>Moors, Arabians, Greeks, La|tines, Turks, Jews,</HI> nay, I may &s;afely, and probably &s;ay, with People of all Nations.</P>
<P>The whole Land containeth Four Regions, <HI>Idumea, Judea, Samaria,</HI> and <HI>Gallilee, Idumea,</HI> beginneth at Mount <HI>Ca&s;&s;ius;</HI> or as &s;ome will, at the Lake <HI>Sirbon,</HI> reaching to the Ea&s;tward of <HI>Judea;</HI> The Cheif Cities are <HI>Mare&s;a, Rhinocorura, Rapha, Antedon, A&s;calon, Azotus,</HI> and <HI>Gaza.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mare&s;a</HI> was the birth-place of the Prophet <HI>Micha.</HI> Neer unto this town, <HI>Judas Machabeus</HI>

<PB N="2" REF="24">yet according to your de&s;ires, I pre&s;ent you with this my De&s;cription.</HI></P>
<P>TUe&s;day <HI>May</HI> 3. 1669. we &s;et Sail from <HI>Scanderoon,</HI> with a <HI>N. E.</HI> wind on the <HI>Margaret, Tho. Middleton</HI> Commander, be|ing fourteen Engli&s;h Men, (of the Factory of <HI>Aleppo</HI>) in Com|pany; but being forced to re|turn three times, by contrary Winds, by <HI>May</HI> 10. we arrived at <HI>Trippoly,</HI> who&s;e Port is guar|ded with &s;ix &s;mall Ca&s;tles, near the Sea, and one great Ca&s;tle upon the Land; and is defen|ded from Tempe&s;ts, on the We&s;t with I&s;lands, and on the Ea&s;t, with a Cape of Land; &s;o that none but a North wind can be
<PB N="3" REF="24">prejudicial to Ships in this Port: the Ground is &s;tony, which forc'd the Captains to buoy up their Cables, the &s;hips riding in &s;ix or &s;even Fathom Wa|ter.</P>
<P>The Town is about a mile from the Marine, &s;ituated upon the &s;helf of a Hill, and hath one good Ca&s;tle for its defence; the Town is ruinate, and there were few People to be &s;een, at that time, it being the time of making white Silk, mo&s;t of the People being in their Gardens.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> Thirteen, after three days Treatment by the <HI>Con&s;ul</HI> (for <HI>Engli&s;h, French</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI>) with extraordinary Civility; about four of the clock in the after|noon, we &s;et forward for Mount
<PB N="4" REF="25"><HI>Lebanon,</HI> and two hours Riding from <HI>Trippoly,</HI> we pitched our Tent at the Village <HI>Coffer&s;inue;</HI> the Inhabitants are Chri&s;tians, and live in hou&s;es made of Reeds, and Covered with Bu&s;h|es; and the Rode to this Vil|lage, is very good and plea&s;ant, pa&s;&s;ing to it, through a Forre&s;t of Olive Trees; and in the Val|leys, are Gardens of Mulberries, with which they feed their Silk-Worms.</P>
<P>Friday <HI>May</HI> fourteenth, we de|parted from <HI>Coffer&s;inue,</HI> about four of the clock in the morning, pa&s;&s;ing in a good Rode, and through Plains &s;owed with Wheat: about &s;ix of the Clock, we pa&s;&s;ed over &s;everal Moun|tains re&s;embling Marble, if not
<PB N="5" REF="25">really &s;o; from which we had a very good Pro&s;pect of the fruit|fulne&s;s of the Valleys: between the&s;e Mountains, upon the a&s;cent of an Hill, we came to a Foun|tain where we break-fa&s;ted; at &s;even of the clock we ro&s;e from the Fountain, and having pa&s;|&s;ed a very dangerous ragged Mountain, about nine of the Clock we came to <HI>Eden,</HI> a &s;mall Village, and extraordinary plea&s;antly &s;eated, being &s;ur|rounded with Mulberries, Wal|nuts, and other &s;orts of Trees; Walnut e&s;pecially we found ve|ry common on this Mount: we went to the <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> Hou&s;e, a mo&s;t mi&s;erable ruinated Cottage, where the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> coming to bid us welcome, appeared more like a
<PB N="6" REF="26">Dunghil-raker then a <HI>Bi&s;hop.</HI> We enquired whence this Village had its name, the <HI>Maronites</HI> (which generally inhabit the Mountains) &s;ay, this was the place where <HI>Adam</HI> commit|ted the &s;in of Eating the For|bidden Fruit; but the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> told us, it was in Heaven, where there were three Trees, <HI>Adam</HI> being forbidden to eat of one of them which wa the Fig-tree: but having eaten, he fell from Hea|van, and fell among the <HI>Cedars</HI> (which are &s;ome two hours ri|ding from the <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> hou&s;e), and there he began to till the Ground. But the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> being very Igno|rant of the&s;e things, we forbear to enquire farther. The <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> have great re&s;pect &s;hewed them,
<PB N="7" REF="26">every one Ki&s;&s;ing his Hand on their Knees bareheaded: in his Hou&s;e he hath a ruinate Church, with an Altar in it; and a little beyond his hou&s;e, is a little Chappel, neer the head of the Rivolet that feeds his hou&s;e with water, where we found many men with <HI>Frank</HI> names, which had continued there from the Year 1611.</P>
<P>Mid-day coming, the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> made what Preparation his hou&s;e would afford for Dinner, killing two Kids, and a Goat, and giving us the be&s;t Wine the Mountain did afford, being a well reli&s;hed Red and White Wine.</P>
<P>Night coming, after Sup|per, we ki&s;s'd his Hand; and next
<PB N="8" REF="27">morning, we being now but twelve in Company, went to take our leave of him, and made him a pre&s;ent of Livers, be&s;ides &s;omething to the &s;er|vants, as is u&s;ual for Pilgrims that take this Voyage; two of our Company waiting our re|turn at <HI>Trippoly.</HI></P>
<P>Saturday <HI>May</HI> the fifteenth, about five a Clock in the mor|ning, we ro&s;e from thence, and a|bout eight of the Clock we came to the <HI>Cedars;</HI> all that remain of them, being in a very &s;mall compa&s;s: We &s;pent &s;ome time in cutting &s;ticks, and &s;etting our Names on the great Trees.</P>
<P>At this place there came to us the Captain of a Village, cal|led <HI>Up&s;hara,</HI> an hours riding from
<PB N="9" REF="27">the <HI>Caedars.</HI> In our way, as we returned; he envited us to Din|ner at his Village, which we ac|cepted of, and after dinner made him a Pre&s;ent; This man is a <HI>Maronite,</HI> and takes <HI>Caffar</HI> or Toll of the <HI>Turks,</HI> which pa&s;s that way with their Sheep and Oxen; he hath a hundred Soul|diers under his Command, who are all Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>About two a clock we moun|ted, and after three hours riding, we came to a mighty deep De|&s;cent, winding in and out, which is the way to the Patriark of the <HI>Maronites</HI> hou&s;e, called <HI>Caunibone;</HI> it is a very good Convent, and lies under the Rocks, they have a Bell in the Church as in <HI>Europe,</HI> and goe
<PB N="10" REF="28">to their Devotions Morning and Evening: After we had ki&s;&s;ed the Patriarks hand, we deman|ded what was to be &s;een, and the Druggerman carried us to &s;ee <HI>St. Marene's</HI> Grot, of whom they recount this Story.</P>
<P><Q>That a <HI>Venetian,</HI> in the time that the <HI>Franks</HI> had the Coun|trey, came with his wife and and one daughter to live there; and after &s;ome years, his Wife dying, he was re&s;olved to goe into the Covent and live a reli|gious life, and would therefore have his Daughter to leave him; but his per&s;wa&s;ions could not prevail with her; but ra|ther than leave her Father, &s;he would put on mans Apparrel, and live a devoted life with
<PB N="11" REF="28">him al&s;o; which at la&s;t (though unwilling) he a&s;&s;ented to (&s;he being young and hand&s;om;) there they lived very &s;trictly for &s;everal years; afterward her Father dyed: And the lay Brothers and Fathers going out, as u&s;ually, to Till the ground; She &s;eldome went with them, the Chief of the Convent keeping her at home (being much taken with &s;uch a hand&s;ome young man as he thought) whereupon they be|gan to grumble, that St. <HI>Mar|rene</HI> did not go with them; &s;o that at la&s;t, to &s;atisfy the <HI>Fratres,</HI> he was &s;ent out to work among them near the Village <HI>Tur&s;a:</HI> pre&s;ently after, one of the young Virgins of that Vil|lage
<PB N="12" REF="29">proving with Child, &s;he came to the Convent, and laid it to the charge of St. <HI>Marrena;</HI> who was thereupon pre&s;ently excommunicated, and lived a Religious life in the Grot neer the Convent, for the &s;pace of 7 years; and being then again ad|mitted into the Covent, &amp; &s;till continuing to live a very &s;trict Life, he at length dyed; and the Fathers coming according to their Cu&s;tome, to Anoint the Body, found that he was a Woman; whereupon they began to Cro&s;s them&s;elves, and to beg Pardon for Ex|communicating her; and have built an Altar in the Grot, and call it by the Name of St. <HI>Mar|rena;</HI> as they have al&s;o in &s;e|veral
<PB N="13" REF="29">Grots thereabouts, in remembrance of the Religious Relicks of tho&s;e that dwelt therein; and when they carry any body to &s;ee them, they pre&s;ently fall down to Pray|ers.</Q></P>
<P>About a League from the Convent, are two <HI>French-men</HI> that live a Hermits life, have|ing Bread and Wine allowed them by the Patriark: Night comming on, we went to Sup|per with the Patriark, the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Aleppo,</HI> and two o|ther Bi&s;hops, they having pro|vided what the Place affor|ded; At Supper they brought out a great Gla&s;s, which held neer two Quarts, with which the Old Man &s;oon made him|&s;elf
<PB N="14" REF="30">merry, it being their Cu&s;|tome to drink freely; He telling us, that that Gla&s;s had belon|ged to the Convent more than one hundred Years, and that the <HI>Turks</HI> coming once to Ran|&s;ack the Convent, &s;eeing this Gla&s;s, told one of the <HI>Fratres,</HI> if he could drink off that full of pure Wine, he would &s;ave the Convent; which one of them doing, the <HI>Turks</HI> went away admiring what &s;ort of People they were.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> &s;ixteen, We took our leave of the Patriark, and pre|&s;ented him with &s;ome Livers, as al&s;o to the poor <HI>Frasres,</HI> and other People that belonged to the Convent, and &s;o took our Journey to <HI>Trippoly,</HI> having had
<PB N="15" REF="30">a fair review of tho&s;e Moun|taines, and the Countrey ad|jacent, which is over-&s;pread with many fair Villages, and hath many fruitful Vallyes &s;own with Corn, and great quantity of Mulberry Gardens; it being the general imploy|ment of the Inhabitants to make Silk.</P>
<P>We Return to <HI>Trippoly</HI> to the Con&s;uls Hou&s;e that Night, where after two dayes repo&s;e, and having been extraordinary well Treated, we took our leave of the Con&s;ul.</P>
<P><HI>May,</HI> eighteen, about mid|night, we &s;et &s;ail for <HI>Joppa,</HI> with a good Wind; in the Morning we came in &s;ight of <HI>Cape-Blan|co,</HI> where the wind proving
<PB N="16" REF="31">contrary, we were forced to beat up and down for two days, before we could weather the Cape the wind coming good, we weatherd the Cape, and came in &s;ight of <HI>Cape-Carmel,</HI> which two Capes make the Bay of <HI>Aerica,</HI> on which there is a Convent of white Friers, and there they &s;hewd us <HI>Eli&s;has</HI> Tomb. And three or four hours Sail fur|ther, we came in &s;ight of <HI>Ce&s;area,</HI> now Ruinate, and inhabited by a Company of Savage <HI>A|rabs.</HI></P>
<P><HI>May</HI> twenty three, we Arri|ved at <HI>Joppa,</HI> which hath no harbour to defend Ships from Storms, but hath very good ground to Anchor in, about ten Fathom Water: It is a poor
<PB N="17" REF="31">Town, and hath one Ca&s;tle to defend tho&s;e &s;hips that come in clo&s;e to the Shore; the cheif Trade thereof, is Pot-a&s;hes for Soap, and a few Cottons, and Cotton-Yarn, which the <HI>Franks</HI> bring from thence.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> twenty four, We Arri|ved at <HI>Ramah,</HI> which is a plea|&s;ant Village; the great Trade of the Inhabitants is in Fil|lado's; the People are poor, and the livelyhood of the Wo|men is to Spin that Commodity: We were Treated there at the Convent, till a Me&s;&s;enger was di&s;patched to the Convent at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> for our Admittance to pa&s;s thither, becau&s;e of &s;ome extravagant Stories that flew abroad, of the Plague raging
<PB N="18" REF="32">in the place from whence we came: our me&s;&s;enger returned back that night.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> the twenty fifth, in the morning, we mounted to take our Journey for <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and baited at St. <HI>Jeroms</HI> Church a|bout twelve of the Clock, to Eat what &s;mall provi&s;ions we had with us: and the heat of the Day being pa&s;&s;ed, we procee|ded on our Journey; and about four of the Clock in the after|noon we Arrived at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> at <HI>Joppa</HI> Gate; where we tar|ried till the Druggerman of the Convent went to the <HI>Caddy</HI> for Licence for us to enter the City; which having obtained, and delivering up our Swords, and what other Armes we had,
<PB N="19" REF="32">to be carried to the Convent; we entred the City on Foot, and were conducted by the Durggerman to the <HI>Latines</HI> Con|vent, with two or three Fa|thers Accompanying us; we &s;ound them at their Devotions, and afterwards we all went in|to the Father <HI>Guardians</HI> Cham|ber, who imbraced us, and bid us welcome; We were carried to our Lodgings, and the Fa|ther Procurator came to us, and pa&s;&s;ed a Complement on us, bringing two or three bottles of the be&s;t Wine, and de&s;iring us to call for what we wanted; this was our fir&s;t Entertain|ment.</P>
<P>But I &s;hould have given you an Account that our Drugger|man,
<PB N="20" REF="33"><HI>Mallinis Salley</HI> by name, who conducted us from <HI>Joppa,</HI> through the Mountains up to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> was formerly a Rob|ber him&s;elf, and could there|fore the better carry us through the <HI>Arabs,</HI> who mole&s;t tho&s;e Mountaines and live all upon Purcha&s;e; he was a <HI>Greek</HI> by Nation and Religion.</P>
<P>Now to our further Enter|tainment at <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> the next morning Father <HI>Toma&s;o,</HI> a Lay|brother, one mighty &s;erious, and Religious in their way, came to our Chamber with Milk, Wine and Fruit, (with a Ble&s;&s;ing in his Mouth) the &s;ea|&s;on being very hot: and a|bout twelve of the Clock we went to Dinner, two or three
<PB N="21" REF="33">Lay Brothers attending at the Hall door, with a Ba&s;on and Ewer for us to wa&s;h; and then entring the Hall, the Fathers &s;tood all on one &s;ide near one another, &s;aying Grace in La|tin, and then &s;inging the Lords Prayer altogether; and after|ward bowing toward the Picture of our Saviour at Supper with his Apo&s;tles, which is placed over the <HI>Guardians</HI> Head, ador|ned with Silver Cro&s;&s;es about it, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The <HI>Guardian</HI> hath his Table alone in the middle of the Room, and two long Tables &s;tand of each &s;ide, one for the Pilgrims, and the other for the Fathers; after they had ki&s;s'd the ground, we all &s;ate down, and had eve|ry
<PB N="22" REF="34">one his alotment brought in a little di&s;h, of which we ne|ver wanted three or four Cour|&s;es of &s;everal &s;orts of Meat: our Wine, Water, and Fruit, was &s;et ready for us; the Wine was about a Quart, the Water &s;omething le&s;s, which was the allowance of two men, and had two Gla&s;&s;es belonging to it: a|bout the middle of Dinner, the <HI>Frater</HI> came, and changed our Water, that it might drink the fre&s;her.</P>
<P>Dinner being ended, the Fa|ther &mdash; <HI>Guardian</HI> knocks, and the <HI>Fraters</HI> ri&s;e and kneel with their Faces toward the Picture of our Saviour with his Di&s;ciples at Supper, and mumbling &s;ome|thing to them&s;elves, they ki&s;s
<PB N="23" REF="34">the ground, and then begin to take away; one taking away the Di&s;hes, another the Knives, every one having his appoint|ment, and then give Thanks in the &s;ame manner as before Dinner; then wa&s;hing at the door, they go into the Church to Prayer, for a quarter of an hour; this they do daily, ri&s;ing always early, and in the Night al&s;o, to go to Ma&s;s.</P>
<P>At this time there were two or three Chri&s;tians come from <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> who&s;e art is to make the Figure of our Saviours Se|pulcher, or what Holy Story you plea&s;e, upon your Arm; they make it of a blew colour, and it is done by the continu|all pricking of your Arm with
<PB N="24" REF="35">Needles; they began pre&s;ently to go to work on &s;ome of us, and having pre&s;ented us the Patterns of abundance of Prints, every one took his Fan|cy.</P>
<P>The next day, <HI>May</HI> twenty &s;even, we all agreed to goe in|to the Temple, and about four a Clock in the afternoon we went: There are about ten or twelve Fathers that live there continually, and have their Church there: The door is &s;ea|led with the <HI>Caddys</HI> Seal, and when any man goes in, he pays fourteen Livers; we being en|tred the Temple, the Fathers came and Saluted us, and con|ducted us to their Lodgings; where after we had been about
<PB N="25" REF="35">an hour, they prepared to go in Proce&s;&s;ion to all the holy places, pre&s;enting us every one a Book of Holy Songs, for every place in <HI>Latin.</HI></P>
<P>And &s;o we &s;et out, the Fa|thers being dre&s;&s;ed in white Surplices; and the <HI>Cheif</HI> a|mong them with Cloth of Sil|ver over his Surplice, with two more dre&s;&s;ed in the like Garb to lead him: there was a great Silver Cro&s;s carried before him, with the Picture of our Savi|our Crucified upon it, and two men going on each &s;ide of it, with Incen&s;e Pots, to per&s;ume every Holy Place, that we came to. And &s;o we went to the&s;e places following:</P>
<P N="1">1 To the Pillar to which our
<PB N="26" REF="36">Saviour was bound when he was &s;courged.</P>
<P N="2">2 To the Pri&s;on, wherein our Saviour was put.</P>
<P N="2">3 To the place where the Soldi|ers divided our Saviours Garments.</P>

<P>I might give you a particu|ler de&s;cription of the Adorn|ment of the&s;e Places; but to be &s;hort, every one have Lamps burning at them; &s;ome are pa|ved with Marble, others are hung with Pictures; the place where our Saviour was laid down to be nailed to the Cro&s;s, is paved with Marble; the place where he was Crucified, is pa|ved with Marble al&s;o; but in the exact place where the Cro&s;s &s;tood, the Marble is covered over with Silver, with Silver Lamps, and wax Candles con|tinually burning; and our Sa|viour

<P>After our Proce&s;&s;ion, we went to veiw all the places and Chur|ches again; the <HI>Greeks</HI> have a place in the middle of their Church, which they &s;ay, is the middle of the World: they have another place by the Pri|&s;on of Chri&s;t, with two holes to put the Feet in: there is al|&s;o a narrow Pa&s;&s;age between two Pillars, which is in imita|tion of the &s;traightne&s;s of the Path to Heaven, which the

<P><HI>May</HI> the twenty eight, we went out of the City at <HI>Da|ma&s;cus</HI> Gate, and turning on the right Hand, we came to one of the Fi&s;h-ponds, belonging to the

<P><HI>May</HI> the Twenty-ninth, we repo&s;ed, &s;ome of our Compa|ny being a Marking.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> Thirty, we took Hor&s;e to go for <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> and went out at the We&s;t-Gate called <HI>Joppa</HI>-Gate, and turning on the left hand, and taking the lower Path, we pa&s;&s;ed along the Road that the <HI>Virgin Ma|ry</HI> brought our Saviour, when She came to offer him at the
<PB N="34" REF="40">Temple; and half a mile from the City is the place where the Tree <HI>Tirabintha</HI> grew, which the <HI>Virgin Mary</HI> &s;at under to give him Suck; but the Tree being Cut down, the place is incompa&s;&s;ed with a Wall.</P>

<P>A Mile further is the place where the Angels appeared to the Shep|pards, and &s;ayd, <HI>Gloria in ex|cel&s;is,</HI> &amp;c. when our Saviour was Born, where there hath been a Convent; but now there only remaines an Arched Vault, where we paid Money to the <HI>Arabs;</HI> who when they e&s;py a|ny <HI>Franks</HI> going thither, Ride po&s;t before to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion

<PB N="37" REF="41">comes from the Fountains which feed <HI>Solomons</HI> Ci&s;terns; pa&s;&s;ing a Mile along by the A|queduct, we came to <HI>Solomons</HI> Ci&s;terns, which are Three; the fir&s;t had no Water in it, and might be about two hundred and fifty Yards long, and &s;ixty Yards broad, and of a great depth; the &s;econd, it had lit|tle Water, and was &s;omething le&s;s in Compa&s;s; the third was full of Water and as big as the fir&s;t: they run one into another, and are fed by the &s;pring that feeds the City.</P>
<P>The Fathers &s;ay, that they were made to Swim in, they being built with &s;teps for a Man to goe down, but they &s;eem rather to be intended for a re&s;erve of Water for the City

<P>We mounted our Hor&s;es to pro|ceed on our Journy, leaving the Ca&s;tle on the Right Hand, and at a di&s;tance we &s;aw St. <HI>Georges</HI> Church, where the Fathers &s;ay, the Chaines remain wherewith St. <HI>George</HI> was bound, which

<P>After an hour and a halfes Riding, we came neer to <HI>Beth|lehem,</HI> where pa&s;&s;ing through a narrow Lane, the Guard con|&s;i&s;ting of four or five Mu&s;que|tiers, received five Livers of e|very one of us, and our Drug|german that went with us, re|ceived three: and arriving at the Convent, we payd one for our entrance; and after our being welcomed by the Fa|thers, we took our repo&s;e till five of the Clock in the Evening; and then we prepared to goe in Proce&s;&s;ion to the Holy Pla|ces in the &s;ame manner as we did at the Temple in <HI>Jeru&s;a|lem;</HI> the Places we Vi&s;ited were the&s;e:</P>

<P>At Evening we went to vi&s;it the place of our Saviours Birth, which formerly belonged to the <HI>Latins,</HI> till the <HI>Greeks</HI> bought it out of their Hands; &s;o that now the <HI>Latins,</HI> when they goe their Proce&s;&s;ion, Pray at that Door by which they formerly en|tred.</P>
<P>The <HI>Precipior</HI> hath two Doors, one exactly over again&s;t the o|ther, which are well Lined with Carved Iron, and &s;trengthed with Iron Spikes: We went in Bare-foot, on the Right hand in the entrance, is the place they &s;ay where our Saviour was Born, which is Lined with Marble; and in the midle of the Room there is a little place covered

<P><HI>June</HI> the &s;econd, We began to &s;earch for the Holy places, which are the&s;e following.</P>

<P>Having now &s;een all that was Remarkable in the&s;e Parts, we made toward the Convent, having got a great deal of Cre|dit with Father <HI>Toma&s;a;</HI> that we &s;hould be &s;uch Zealous Pil|grims,
<PB N="65" REF="55">as to walk from five a Clock in the Morning till Mid|day; but he to encourage us, would &s;till be formo&s;t; and told us always, there was &s;ome place more worth our &s;eeing, then any we had &s;een before: and though he was an old man, and the Weather hot, yet at the going up of a Hill, he would run, that he might be foremo&s;t: and gave us all the good Words that could be, to encourage us Prote&s;tants, who never hoped or thought, that we Merited any thing by it: but at length we came to the Convent again, and being well weary, every one retired to his Lodings.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> Third, we repo&s;e at the Convent; after Dinner, one
<PB N="66" REF="56">the Fathers came and told us, that the Father <HI>Guardian</HI> would wa&s;h our Feet; which Honour we accounted too great for us, and de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed&punc; but we were forced to comply with the Orders of the Convent; The Ba&s;on, which was as big as a Tub, was placed by a Chair; there were Ro&s;e-Leaves and Herbs put into the Wa|ter; the Fathers all &s;tood in a Row, Singing Godly Hymns; we &s;at down, and the Father <HI>Guardian</HI> wrapt a Towel about our Knees, to keep our Cloths from Water; then they began to &s;crub our Leggs and Feet, (being Ma&s;ters of their Art) there were two <HI>Fratres</HI> atten|ding, one on one Leg, and ano|ther on the other; having fir&s;t
<PB N="67" REF="56">dryed the left Foot, the <HI>Frater</HI> ki&s;&s;es it, and puts on our Slip|per; then he dryes the Right Foot, and wraps the Towel a|bout the Sole of the Foot, and &s;etting it on his Knee, and co|vers the Toes with his Hand, and then come all the <HI>Fratres,</HI> and Ki&s;&s;es it; this being done, he gives us a little Candle, in taking of which, we ki&s;s his Hand, and &s;o ri&s;e and &s;tand by, till all our Company are Wa&s;hed in like manner. Then went we in Proce&s;&s;ion, round their Chappel, they &s;aying &s;e|veral Prayers, at their three Altars, and &s;o we return to our Chambers.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> the Fourth, Af|ter Dinner, we went into the Kitchen, where we found
<PB N="68" REF="57">all the Fathers, with Napkins before them, wa&s;hing the Di&s;h|es, every one taking his part, even to the Father <HI>Guardian</HI> him&s;elf; &s;ome were cleaning &s;ome handing away; but all the while, with one Con&s;ent, they &s;ay &s;ome Prayer; it &s;eeming to be their endeavour, that all that they do, may be done to the Glory of God; this being done, they goe all to the Chap|pel to Prayers, and you &s;hall never &s;ee the Chappel, with|out &s;ome of them at Prayers; yea, and two or three times in the Night they Ri&s;e to Pray|ers.</P>
<P>On Whit&s;unday, the Chap|pel was Adorned &s;omething Extraordinarily, and there was a very Rich Canopy, &s;et on
<PB N="69" REF="57">the Right Hand of the high Altar, for the Father <HI>Guardian</HI> to &s;it under; when the Pray|ers began, the Father <HI>Guardi|an</HI> came into the Chappel, and &s;ate under this Canopy: There were three or foure Fathers Dre&s;t in Cloth of Silver, much after the manner of a He|rald; two whereof attend on each &s;ide of the <HI>Guardian,</HI> and two &s;tand over again&s;t him.</P>
<P>Then they began to dre&s;s the Father <HI>Guardian</HI> in his Fe&s;ti|val Robes, and having read two or three Lines, they put a peice of Linnen laced about this Neck, and then his Surplice, Reading &s;till between every Robe that was put on. Then they cover him with a Garment of Rich Sattin, and Cloth of Silver; the two
<PB N="70" REF="58">that &s;tand over again&s;t him, bowing at &s;ome words. His body being thus dre&s;t, the two Fathers, put a Myter upon his head, doing it with all the Re|&s;pect Imaginable; after a &s;hort Prayer, they take the Father-<HI>Guardian</HI> by the hand, and lead him to the Altar, he &s;tand|ing in the middle of the four Fathers, adorned as afore&s;aid; the other Fathers have their Surplices on, and the Organs go; then making a &s;hort Pra|yer at the Altar, they lead the <HI>Gardian</HI> to his place again; and after a little reading, they take off his Myter, and he &s;its bare till the Prayer be done: then they put on another Myter; the fir&s;t was of Cloth of Silver, and the &s;econd was of Cloth of
<PB N="71" REF="58">Gold, &s;et full of Rubies, and Diamonds, and other &s;orts of Stones; they afterward took off that al&s;o, and put on a third Myter, which was of Cloth of Gold, &s;omething differing in &s;hape, from the others.</P>
<P>The Guardian being led, to and from the Altar, a great while, at length, when they came to read that place, where the Holy Gho&s;t came down upon the Apo&s;tles, a&s;&s;embled together, there was a Father upon the Terra&s;s, appointed to throw down a white Pidgeon dre&s;t up with Ribbons, in imitation of the Holy Gho&s;t, but he met with &s;ome difficulty; for the window was &s;o fa&s;t &s;hut that he could not open it a great while, &s;o that we had like to
<PB N="72" REF="59">have gone away without their Holy Gho&s;t: but this difficulty being overcome, he made the Dove de&s;cend among us; which being done, after a Prayer, they began to undre&s;s the Fa|ther <HI>Guardian</HI> again, reading all the while his Robes were taking off; and &s;o that days &s;ervice was done.</P>
<P>Now we began to think of going to the Dead Seas, and the River Jordan, we therefore de|manded what our expence would be, the Fathers &s;ay, twen|ty five Livers, but we all agreed not to give above twenty; The Fathers &s;ent our re&s;olution to the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a,</HI> and he return'd us this an&s;wer, That if we would goe, we &s;hould pay twenty two Livers; and if we would not,
<PB N="73" REF="59">he would have ten Livers a man; we thinking our &s;elves under his command, and not willing to embroyl the Convent, for they are to bare all damages, as they have done for &s;everal; but thanks be to God, none hapned in our time.</P>
<P>We all re&s;olved to goe, except Mr. <HI>T. H.</HI> and one Engli&s;hman more, and a Dutchman, not thinking the <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI> had been in earne&s;t; but becau&s;e they went not, they were forced to pay ten Livers for nothing; we then came to <HI>Bethany,</HI> now a &s;mall Village, where entring into a Grot under ground, we &s;aw a Tomb, from whence they &s;ay our Saviour ray&s;ed <HI>Laza|rus,</HI> after he had been dead &s;o many dayes; here we had the
<PB N="74" REF="60"><HI>Ba&s;haws</HI> guard to wait upon us, for fear of the <HI>Arabs,</HI> who are on the other &s;ide <HI>Jordan</HI> in the land of <HI>Moab;</HI> who doe often make incur&s;ions, and have &s;harp di&s;putes, at the end of the Lance, with tho&s;e that live on this &s;ide, in the land of Pro|mi&s;e; The <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI> pretended, that he mu&s;t &s;end fifty men with us, but it proved but fourteen or &s;ixteen,</P>
<P>Having repo&s;ed a little on the ground, about nine of the clock at night, we mounted our Hor&s;es, and pa&s;&s;ing through the turning and winding of the Mountains, we came in the Morning to the foot of the <HI>Qua|rantine</HI> Mountain, where we di&s;mounted; and making the cold earth our bed, we &s;lept
<PB N="75" REF="60">two or three hours, having our hor&s;es made fa&s;t to our hands, and the Sun ri&s;ing, we ro&s;e al&s;o, and walked to <HI>Eli&s;ha's</HI> Fountain, a &s;tones throw off; and before the Sun was too hot, we Mounted our Hor&s;es at the foot of the Mountain, and &s;o began to a&s;cend, it being very &s;teep; having a&s;cended a great height, we came to the place where they &s;ay, our Saviour &s;lept, when he Fa&s;ted Forty days; and from that the Moun|tain received its name; this place is neer the height of the Mountaine, but the pa&s;&s;age to the top, is Known only to the <HI>Arabs;</HI> here is a Church over this place, where &s;ome <HI>Fathers</HI> have lived, till they were Mur|dered by the <HI>Arabs.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="61">
Below this place are &s;everal Ci&s;terns of water, and &s;everal Fronti&s;peices of Chappels, but the pa&s;&s;age to them is cut off; as we were going up, the thoughts of the danger of de|&s;cending, enters into our heads, and the Emperour of <HI>Germanies</HI> Druggerman for the&s;e Coun|trey Languages, being extra|ordinary fearful, got two <HI>Turks</HI> to conduct him down, and &s;o we having all had a &s;afe de&s;cent, we rode cheerfully back to <HI>Eli&s;ha's</HI> Fountain, which was formerly bitter; but he throwing in a handful of &s;alt, the waters be|came &s;weet.</P>
<P>Here we lay till Four a clock, and the heat of the Sun being over, we made for <HI>Jericho,</HI> where we arrived about five,
<PB N="77" REF="61">where there are now, only a few poor Cottages: we pitched by <HI>Zacheus</HI> Tree, the Inhabi|tants are for the mo&s;t part <HI>Ara|bians,</HI> and &s;ome few <HI>Greeks:</HI> here the Captain of the Village came to welcome our <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI> and his people; he was moun|ted upon a Mare, valued at a Thou&s;and Livers, Mares be|ing only in e&s;teem among them; here we repo&s;ed under a rotten hedg, till about four of the Clock next mourning; ha|ing little plea&s;ure in our com|panions, the Gnats, and other &s;tinging creatures.</P>
<P>We proceed for the River <HI>Jordan,</HI> where we arrived by day-light, and tarried about an hour to &s;wim in the River; the &s;tream is &s;trong, and rapid;
<PB N="78" REF="62">and the force of a man, can little more then re&s;i&s;t it; it runs in|to the Dead Sea.</P>
<P>Our Guard were very ha&s;ty for us to be gone, being afraid their Enemies &s;hould find them; therefore we all made ready, and &s;et forward for the Dead Sea; about two hours after in our way to the Sea, we pa&s;&s;ed through a mo&s;t cur&s;ed barren place, not having &s;o much as a green herb or gra&s;s, and the face of the earth was covered with Salt, and though it was dry, yet our Hor&s;es &s;unk up to the Knees.</P>
<P>We come now to the Dead Sea, being about Seventy or Eighty Miles in Breadth, and about Eighteen Over: There is no place Vi&s;ible from whence
<PB N="79" REF="62">the Water, which comes in|to it, runs out again, except it be under the earth; neither doth it &s;eem to Increa&s;e with the water of the River <HI>Jordan,</HI> and of &s;evaral other waters that run into it: It was once a fruit|full Valley, and compared for delight, unto Paradi&s;e, and was called <HI>Pentapolis,</HI> of her five Cities, and was afterward de|&s;troyed with fire from Heaven, and turned into this &s;ilthy Lake, and barren de&s;olation which doth encompa&s;s it: &amp; to try the virtue, that is reported to be in the water, wherein they &s;ay, a man cannot &s;ink; &s;ome of our Company went into the Sea, and found it impo&s;&s;ible to get their bodies under water, yea could hardly keep their legs
<PB N="80" REF="63">under; The water is &s;ulphury, and the extremity of the &s;alt|ne&s;s is not to be expre&s;t; when they came out of the water, there was a perfect Oyl upon their bodies.</P>
<P>Our Eyes being &s;atisfied with Curio&s;ities, and Rarities, we make what ha&s;t we can, back to <HI>Jeru&s;alem:</HI> but I &s;hould have given you an Account, that the Ruins of one of the Cities, that were de&s;toryed for Sodomy, now lyes good part out of the water, and is &s;uppo&s;ed to be <HI>Zeboim.</HI></P>
<P>Now the Sun gets &s;trenght, and grows extraordinary hot, and by reflection on the ground, makes the heat &s;o violent, that our faces looked as if the skin were flead off, by riding
<PB N="81" REF="63">in the Sun, from Morning till four of the Clock in the after|noon; but the Fathers being accu&s;tomed, to meet with ten|der-faced Travellers, &s;oon pro|vided &s;omething to mitigate our pain, which was much in|crea&s;ed, by rea&s;on of the &s;alt|ne&s;s of the water of the <HI>Dead Sea:</HI> this night we took little plea&s;ure in eating, but more in &s;leeping, having had but little in this Voyage.</P>
<P>Having now vi&s;ited all the places in the Holy Land, which Pilgrims u&s;ually do, we pre|pare our &s;elves for our return. <HI>June</HI> Ninth, we being re&s;ol|ved to &s;et forward in our Return; In the Morning the Father <HI>Guardian</HI> came to us, and gave us his ble&s;&s;ing, and
<PB N="82" REF="64">&s;prinkled us with Holy Water, de&s;iring us to excu&s;e our Bad Treatment, and that if at any time we had been di&s;|ta&s;ted, we would pa&s;s it over; but we Knew it was but a com|plement, for we had the Civile&s;t Entertainment imaginable, and very far from di&s;gu&s;ting us; for there were none of them, but were not only ready to be our &s;ervants, but our Slaves, yea, my hone&s;t name-&s;ake, Fa|ther <HI>Toma&s;o,</HI> never cea&s;ed from Morning to Night, from bringing us either Victuals or Drink, or asking us whether we wanted any thing; and now for this his fourteen days &s;er|vice, we were no ways capa|ble to recompence him; for they would take no money,
<PB N="83" REF="64">but for our Victuals, and for &s;ome other &s;mall &s;ervices; we therefore pre&s;ented to the Con|vent, thirty Livers apeice, and &s;ome that had &s;ervants pre&s;ent|ed more. The Father <HI>Procurator</HI> receiving it, they entred all our names in a Book, and the &s;ums we gave; the Book where the names only were written, we had a view of, and took a Coppy, of all the <HI>Engli&s;hmens</HI> names that were in it, from the year One Thou&s;and Five Hundred Sixty One, to this day, being One Hundred Fifty Eight in number.</P>
<P>Now taking our leaves of the Fathers, they all &s;hewed a great deal of affection to us, weeping, and expre&s;&s;ing their de&s;ires, to enjoy our company
<PB N="84" REF="65">longer; and our de&s;ires were as much to be nearer home, that we might have an Account of our Freinds.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> the Fourth we departed, our <HI>Muletters</HI> having provided us Hor&s;es; and our intentions were to take <HI>Emaus</HI> in our way, but night drawing on, we made St. <HI>Jeroms</HI> Church our &s;leep|ing place; there were formerly Fathers lived in it, but the <HI>Arabs</HI> came upon them in the night, and cut all their throats; The Church is very well built, and hath been adorned with Pictures upon the wall, of which &s;ome remain to this day.</P>
<P>About too hours riding from <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> we pa&s;&s;ed over the brook, out of which they &s;ay,
<PB N="85" REF="65"><HI>David</HI> gathered the pebble &s;tones, wherewith he &s;lew <HI>Go|liah.</HI></P>
<P><HI>June</HI> Fifth, we arrived at the Convent in <HI>Ramath,</HI> about ten of the Clock in the Morning; where we tarried till about mid|night, at which time there was a Ship to depart, and &s;ome of us intended to embarque; the re&s;t of us took a little boat, about the bigne&s;s of a <HI>Grave&s;end</HI> Barge; we put our provi&s;ions of Bread and Wine aboard, and &s;o we put to Sea, keep|ing always neer the &s;hore, for fear of a &s;torm.</P>
<P>After three days &s;ayl, we ar|rived at <HI>Aerica,</HI> formerly called <HI>Ptolemais,</HI> we always coming to Anchor at night; this place is famous for nothing but the ruins,
<PB N="86" REF="66">the Road being &s;o bad, that all the Art Captains have, can but keep their Cables toge|ther.</P>
<P>The Commodities in this place, are only <HI>Cottons, Pot-a&s;hes,</HI> and fome <HI>Filletto's.</HI></P>
<P>Two days after we arrived at <HI>Tripoly,</HI> where we made bold, at our old Hou&s;e; the Con&s;ul receives us very gladly, and our de&s;ign was, to depart next day, but the Plague &s;till raging at <HI>Aleppo,</HI> the Con&s;ul forced us to &s;tay with him Twelve or Fourteen days; all which time we were treated like Princes, and then by his leave, we imbarqued on a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship for <HI>Scanderoon;</HI> the re&s;t of our Company (whom we left at <HI>Aerica</HI> to goe to &s;ee the

<P><HI>June</HI> Twenty Six, we arrived at <HI>Scanderoon,</HI> where &s;ome were dead, and others dying, and one flying from another.</P>
<P>We tarried upon the Mount, and aboard the Ship for &s;ome time: and <HI>July</HI> 2d we arrived at <HI>Aleppo,</HI> where there dyed at that time, Seventy or Eighty of a day of the Plague.</P>
