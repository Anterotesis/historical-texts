<P>AS I am in duty bound to give you Account of my being, as you are the Per&s;on from whom I derive it, &s;o I ac|knowledge my &s;elf obliged (next after God, from who&s;e infinite Mercies I do from the bottom of my Heart con|fe&s;s to receive my pre&s;ervation and well-being) to let you, and my Friends in <HI>England</HI> under&s;tand, as well as of my &s;elf, the pre&s;ervation of a great part of Chri&s;tendom, from the fury, rage and threatning Ruine, of that implacable and univer&s;al Enemy the <HI>Turk,</HI> who under the Command of the Grand <HI>Vi&s;ier,</HI> with a very power|ful Army, con&s;i&s;ting of near an Hundred and Fifty Thou&s;and men, had a very con&s;iderable time Be&s;eiged the Imperial City of <HI>Vienna;</HI> for the relief of which the Emperour had confederated all the Friends and Allyes he could in all the adjacent Territories, among which indeed I mu&s;t &s;ay the chiefe&s;t was th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> King of <HI>Poland,</HI> who&s;e Conduct and Valour had been &s;ufficiently proved again&s;t the <HI>Turks,</HI> by the &s;everal con&s;iderable overthrows he hath given them, in Defence of that &s;mall Kingdom of <HI>Poland,</HI> and together with him the Dukes of <HI>Bavaria, Saxany,</HI> and others of the Princes; of the Empire had joyned as they were able to bring up their Forces &s;o that in effect, with the Duke of <HI>Lorraine,</HI> who Commanded as General all the Im|perial &s;tanding Forces, they had compacted a prety con&s;iderable Body with which it was advi&s;ed they might, with the ble&s;&s;ing of God, relieve this mi&s;erably di&s;tre&s;&s;ed City. And thus we marched on to try what could be done, but the King of <HI>Poland</HI> de&s;ired Fir&s;t, that he might be a little ac|quainted with the po&s;ture of the Enemy, and to that purpo&s;e drew out a con&s;iderable party of Hor&s;e, and marched on till he came within view of their Leaguer, the Army, e&s;pecially of Hor&s;e, following after with all di|ligence and Expedition, &s;o that although the <HI>Turk,</HI> had by his Scout and Spies Intelligence, that there was a powerful Army approaching him, yet he drew lei&s;urely out of his Trenches, not dreading, any great Oppo&s;ition, e&s;pecially becau&s;e he was informed of a &s;trong body of the <HI>Bours</HI> of the
<PB REF="2" MS="y">Country, who had gathered to an Head not far from him, Now indeed the&s;e poor people having been &s;o long oppre&s;&s;ed, and driven from their Habita|tions by the <HI>Turks,</HI> ever &s;ince they came before <HI>Vienna,</HI> hearing of the Conjunction of &s;o many good Chri&s;tian Princes, drawing towards <HI>Vienna</HI> to relieve it, thought it was now time, not to hide them&s;elves any longer in Holes, and therefore addre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves to &s;ome old Commanders, who were in an equal condition with them&s;elves, they marched on a little too ha&s;tily towards the Enemy, who &s;uppo&s;ing the&s;e the greate&s;t Force com|ing upon him, &s;ent pre&s;ently a party to di&s;&s;olve them, which fell with &s;uch Violence upon the&s;e poor Men, but half armed, and at the Fir&s;t wor&s;ted them, and as is &s;uppo&s;ed de&s;troyed above 1500 on the place; but ju&s;t at the &s;ame In&s;tant the King of <HI>Poland</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Emperour him&s;elf and the others, with a full Body of re&s;olute Hor&s;e, fell violently upon the <HI>Turks</HI> Army, who by this time had clearly left their Trenches, and fell upon them with that Conduct, valour and re&s;olution, e&s;pecially upon the <HI>Jani&s;aries,</HI> that they were &s;oon di&s;ordered, and in a &s;hort time became a Prey to the Swo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">d, by which means the <HI>Turks</HI> main Strength and relyance was quite di&s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">ed, and all the re&s;t, who were very numerous, being now bravely a&s;|&s;aulted on all hands, (for by this time the <HI>Bours,</HI> who had before &s;uffered, &s;ome little di&s;comfeiture, by the conduct and advice of their Leaders had rallyed and made con&s;iderable Oppo&s;ition) &s;ubmitted to a General defeat. Tho I mention onely the conduct of that Heroick King of <HI>Poland,</HI> who&s;e Honour can never be enough applauded, yet his Imperial Maje&s;ty was in per&s;on an Actor in this memorable Battle, as al&s;o &s;everal Princes of the Empire, who&s;e Catalogue would &s;well my Letter to an unplea&s;ing length.

<P>I Have been &s;o intent in relating the Proceedings of the Armies, that I had quite omitted the condition in which we found <HI>Vienna,</HI> who th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;uffici|ently couragious, yet was in very great di&s;tre&s;s. The la&s;t Storm the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">nemy made upon them was forced on with &s;uch Violence, that the account the people of the City gave of it, &s;eems, in their own words very proper as they render it, that they came upon them like Mountains of Men, as they appeared, more then Armies, for the <HI>Turk</HI> forced his men on &s;o fa&s;t, that they run over one another and tho&s;e that were &s;lain or beaten down, were but Foot&s;teps and degrees of advantage, to mount the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Troop to that height, that they could in a manner overlook the City-Walls, and in that manner came pouring on with &s;uch a de&s;peration, it was very hard to with&s;tand them.
