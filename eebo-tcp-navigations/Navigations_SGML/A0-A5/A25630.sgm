<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN your la&s;t, I received two Letters in Print, Concerning the <HI>Ea&s;t India-Company;</HI> which, con&s;idering that you have been acquainted, how great a part of my E&s;tate is entru&s;ted to that <HI>Society,</HI> I cannot but take it as a Friendly Adverti&s;ement; for which, be plea&s;ed to accept my Hearty Thanks. And I a&s;&s;ure you, whatever my Sentiments are of the affair, I do and &s;hall own it for an evident Demon&s;tration of your Affection, that in the mid&s;t of your great Affairs, you &s;hould be &s;o mindfull of my Concerns.</P>
<P>I have peru&s;ed the &s;aid Letters, and can &s;ee no rea&s;on to believe that &s;uch Di&s;cour&s;es &s;hould be publi&s;hed by any per&s;on who&s;e E&s;tate was entru&s;ted to the &s;aid <HI>Company;</HI> or that had any real de&s;ire of receiving or giving &s;atis|faction concerning the &s;ecurity of Money lent to them. No <HI>Creditor</HI> can be &s;uppo&s;ed to act &s;o contrary to his own intere&s;t, as to make it his endeavour to weaken or le&s;&s;en his &s;ecurity, by Expo&s;ing and Ruining his <HI>Debtors Cre|dit;</HI> or teaching him a way to defraud him&s;elf, which is the Language of tho&s;e Papers. It mu&s;t therefore be &s;ome other Per&s;on then a <HI>Creditor,</HI> and &s;ome other De&s;ign than a doubt about <HI>Security,</HI> that occa&s;ioned the Pub|li&s;hing the&s;e Letters. There hath been a report that the <HI>Dutch</HI> had in De|&s;ign to propo&s;e at the <HI>Treaty</HI> at <HI>Nimegen,</HI> a Re&s;traint of the Importation of <HI>Callico</HI> into <HI>Europe,</HI> becau&s;e it hinders the con&s;umption of <HI>French, Hol|land, Flanders,</HI> and <HI>German Linnens:</HI> And lately &s;ome here did Decry the <HI>Ea&s;t-India-Company</HI> and Trade, becau&s;e <HI>Callico</HI> (as they &s;aid) hindred the vent of <HI>Fu&s;tians</HI> and &s;ome other Native Manufactures. The&s;e corre&s;|ponding &s;o exactly, give ground to think they proceed from the &s;ame Coun|cell, and the <HI>Authour</HI> of the&s;e Letters may be of that <HI>Caball.</HI></P>
<P>He fir&s;t endeavours to de&s;troy the <HI>Credit</HI> of the <HI>Company,</HI> by telling us, <HI>That their Seal is le&s;s &s;ecurity, than the word of any one &s;ufficient man among them; for that not any one of the Companies Per&s;ons or E&s;tates,</HI> (he meanes be&s;ide what is in the joynt &s;tock of the Company) <HI>whether Real or Per&s;onal is thereby bound,</HI> neither <HI>can any of them be arre&s;ted or impleaded by virtue thereof,</HI> Who is there &s;o ignorant, but knowes this? though the <HI>Gentle|man</HI> &s;uppo&s;eth all are &s;uch Fools, that have lent money to the Company, that they were <HI>like fi&s;h drawn into the Net, by vainly imagining that every mem|ber in the Company in his Particular and Private capacity was bound to an|&s;wer for the &s;ame.</HI> I dare &s;ay not one of forty that have lent money to
<PB N="2" REF="3">the <HI>Company</HI> thought &s;o. I have heard indeed of one that had a con&s;ide|rable &s;umme there, who upon the advice of &s;ome <HI>Councel</HI> of this <HI>Gentle|mans</HI> Capacity, demanded his money, which being pre&s;ently paid him by the <HI>Ea&s;t-India-Company,</HI> he lodged it in <HI>Lombard&s;treet,</HI> where it lyes (and is like toly) till the opening of the Exchequer. I &s;uppo&s;e he rendered the <HI>GEntleman</HI> no thanks for his advice, nor accounts him&s;elf the wi&s;er man for following it. If it be &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;idered, on what grounds, per&s;ons have cho&s;en to put their money into the <HI>Ea&s;t-India-Companies</HI> hands, rather than to entru&s;t it el&s;ewhere; it will appear they were no &s;uch Fools, as they are character'd for, nor the Security &s;o &s;light, as the <HI>Gentleman</HI> would have us be|lieve it to be.</P>
<P>The <HI>Gentleman preferrs a &s;ufficient mans word,</HI> (I will &s;uppo&s;e his bond which is more valid, in regard of the uncertainty of life.) It's difficult to know who is <HI>&s;ufficient;</HI> all is not Gold that gli&s;ters, or every man <HI>&s;ufficient</HI> that is thought &s;o. If he be <HI>&s;ufficient</HI> when you lend the money, who can a&s;&s;ure him&s;elf, he will Continue either <HI>&s;ufficient,</HI> or <HI>hone&s;t.</HI> Men are change|able, and their E&s;tates &s;ubject to accidents. Doth not experience evi|dence, that lo&s;&s;es at &s;ea, lo&s;&s;es by fire, lo&s;&s;es by bad debts, and other Ca&s;ualties, have rendred <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> in&s;olvent, that had great <HI>E&s;tates</HI> and <HI>Cre|dit,</HI> as al&s;o that &s;ometimes <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> have purcha&s;ed lands in their <HI>Chil|drens</HI> names, and otherwi&s;e &s;o conveyed away their <HI>E&s;tates,</HI> that their <HI>Creditors</HI> could never reach them; and if they &s;eize their Per&s;ons they can live in the <HI>Rules,</HI> and laugh at their <HI>Creditors.</HI> As for lending money on <HI>Mortgages</HI> and <HI>real &s;ecurity,</HI> which is e&s;teemed the be&s;t <HI>&s;ecurity;</HI> Is it not very trouble&s;ome to attend on <HI>Councell,</HI> to examine <HI>Titles,</HI> to make <HI>Con|veyances?</HI> And when all is done with the greate&s;t advice and circum&s;pec|tion; is it not very hazardous, in regard of bad <HI>Titles, Dormant Con|veyances,</HI> and <HI>Precontracts?</HI> can the mo&s;t eminent and &s;ubtile <HI>Lawyers</HI> &s;e|cure them&s;elves? have ot &s;ome of them been over-reached? And &s;ome|times when the &s;ecurity is good as to the main; yet what difficulty, trou|ble, and vexation is there to arrive at &s;atisfaction, by attending long <HI>Sutes</HI> in <HI>Chancery,</HI> accounting for profits, The <HI>Creditor</HI> being often|times made the Debtors &s;teward, and that without Salary or Compen&s;a|tion for his pains. And on &s;uch <HI>Securities</HI> who can depend on his money to an&s;wer his Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>If he have a <HI>Daughter</HI> to <HI>Marry,</HI> a Son to preferre in <HI>Trade,</HI> or a <HI>Pur|cha&s;e</HI> to make, all his de&s;igns are fru&s;trated, His money being (if not in Hell unretreviable, yet) in <HI>Purgatory,</HI> whence it cannot be delivered but in a long Tract of time, and that by patient undergoing the &s;marting Torment of Tedious and Chargeable Sutes. It mu&s;t be acknowledged, that there
<PB N="3" REF="3">is no ab&s;olute certainty or a&s;&s;urance of any thing in this World; and whoever believes otherwi&s;e, is gone beyond the bounds of <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>Religion;</HI> and fit only to re&s;ide in the new <HI>Palace</HI> in <HI>Moorfields.</HI> All that can be de&s;ired in the putting out of money, is to have a vi&s;ible <HI>fond</HI> engaged, that is <HI>morally</HI> (not only at the time of lending) mo&s;t &s;uffici|ent to &s;ecure it, but al&s;o in probability mo&s;t likely to continue &s;o, and to an&s;wer the Occa&s;ions of the Lender.</P>
<P N="1">1. Then, They that lend Money to the <HI>Ea&s;t India-Company,</HI> on their <HI>Common Seal,</HI> have a vi&s;ible <HI>fond</HI> engaged that is &s;ufficient to &s;ecure the &s;ame. Though the <HI>Members</HI> of the <HI>Company</HI> are neither re&s;pon&s;ible in their Per&s;ons, nor private E&s;tates for what is taken up thereupon, yet all the Moneys, Goods, and Effects belonging to the <HI>Joynt &s;tock</HI> of the <HI>Company</HI> are engaged, as the Gentleman him&s;elf is nece&s;&s;itated to acknow|ledge. His in&s;inuations concerning the ca&s;e of the <HI>Merchant-Ad|venturers,</HI> and <HI>Grocers Company,</HI> are not to the purpo&s;e; tho&s;e <HI>Compa|nies</HI> never had any <HI>Joint-&s;tock,</HI> as a vi&s;ible <HI>fund</HI> to &s;ecure what they bor|rowed, but were tru&s;ted upon their bare Reputation and Credit. It is farre otherwi&s;e here. Suppo&s;e there hath been lent to the <HI>En&s;t-Iudia-Com|pany</HI> 5 or 600 thou&s;and pound, the Lenders either do or might know, that there is in the <HI>Joint-&s;tock</HI> of the &s;aid Company in real value upwards of 900 thou&s;and pound, (I may &s;ay a <HI>Million</HI> of pounds <HI>&s;terling</HI>) be|&s;ides their dead &s;tock, which is al&s;o con&s;iderable. All which, being toge|ther a <HI>Million</HI> and <HI>Half</HI> of <HI>pounds &s;terling,</HI> &s;tands by their <HI>Common Seal</HI> bound and engaged to pay their <HI>Creditors.</HI> The <HI>Gentleman</HI> doth Ignorantly, if not Malitiou&s;ly a&s;&s;ert, pag. 4. That the <HI>Ea&s;t-India-Com|pany trades wholly with their Creditors Money, and that it's &s;eldome that they have above</HI> 600 <HI>thou&s;and pounds in value in their India Factories, and on the Seas at the &s;ame time.</HI> To demon&s;trate the fal&s;ity of which, take but an account of what they &s;ent out this la&s;t year, and it will be found to be upwards of 450 thou&s;and pounds: And to that adde the value of the 3 <HI>Ships</HI> already arrived this year from <HI>Bantam;</HI> and the 5 <HI>Ships</HI> from <HI>Surrat;</HI> with the other 6 or 7 <HI>Ships</HI> expected from the <HI>Coa&s;t Surrat</HI> and <HI>Bantam,</HI> which will amount at lea&s;t to 800 <HI>thou&s;and pounds</HI> (and as Sales may prove, to a great deal more) &s;o that there ap|pears to have been above 12 <HI>hundred thou&s;and pounds value</HI> on the Seas at one time, be&s;ide all the remains of Goods and Debts in <HI>India</HI> and in <HI>England.</HI> There being then &s;uch a <HI>&s;tock,</HI> it cannot be denyed but that there is a vi&s;ible and &s;ufficient <HI>fond</HI> to &s;ecure the Creditors the Moneys that they have lent. But the <HI>Gentleman</HI> tells us, <HI>pag.</HI> 4. <HI>The Indians or Infidels may de&s;troy their Factories, and Goods in India;
<PB N="4" REF="4">their Ships and Cargo's may be lo&s;t or taken in Warr, or by Pirates, and the Company may make a Divident to &s;ecure their own E&s;tates, and leave the Creditors to find a thing in the Clouds.</HI> Therefore it will be nece&s;&s;ary in the next place to evidence that the <HI>joynt &s;tock</HI> of the <HI>Ea&s;t-India-Com|pany</HI> is on Morall and Rational grounds, mo&s;t likely to continue &s;uffi|cient to &s;ecure the moneys lent thereupon. That which might render it in&s;ufficient according to the <HI>Gentlemans</HI> &s;ugge&s;tions, is either lo&s;&s;es arriv|ing from Forreign accidents, or di&s;hone&s;t practices either by concealment, or by making dividents of the <HI>&s;tock</HI> among&s;t the Members of the <HI>Com|pany,</HI> without regard to the payment of the Debtors.</P>
<P N="1">1. As to Ca&s;ualties, whereby lo&s;&s;es may happen to the &s;tock; The Gentleman mentions a Concatenation of Evils, <HI>De&s;truction</HI> from the <HI>In|dians, Lo&s;&s;es</HI> by <HI>Stormes,</HI> by <HI>War</HI> and by <HI>Pirates.</HI> Should we wrack our fancies to find out, and then &s;uffer our thoughts to dwell on the con&s;i|deration of the accidents that may fall out in Humane affaires, we &s;hould never enjoy quiet in our Mindes; or el&s;e we &s;hould be deterred from re|&s;olving or &s;etting upon any affair. For as the wi&s;e man tells us, <HI>He that ob&s;erves the Wind &s;hall not Sow, and he that regardeth the Clouds &s;hall not Reap.</HI> It is &s;ufficient, that we take the mo&s;t probable ways of Security, and leave the re&s;t to Divine Providence. Now if we con&s;ider the affaires of the <HI>Ea&s;t-India-Company</HI> without prejudice, we cannot but conclude that their <HI>&s;tock</HI> of 1600 <HI>thou&s;and pounds,</HI> will always be &s;ufficient to an|&s;wer 600 <HI>thou&s;and pounds.</HI> For the whole at no time, is hazarded in one bottom, as it often falls out in private mens dealings; Some part is in <HI>England</HI> in Goods and Debts, &s;ome part in <HI>India</HI> in Trade and Voy|ages, and &s;ome part is at Sea, Going and Coming; not in one Ship but in 30 Ships or more, not in one Cour&s;e or Voyage, but in &s;everal: So that though a lo&s;s &s;hould happen to &s;ome part, yet in the ordinary cour&s;e of providence, there is Rational ground to believe there would be alwayes enough pre&s;erved to an&s;wer the Engagements.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. As to di&s;hone&s;t practices, is it Rationally to be &s;uppo&s;ed that a Number of men can &s;o ea&s;ily engage in wicked and cheating actions? The <HI>Government</HI> of the <HI>Ea&s;t-India &s;tock</HI> is committed to 26 <HI>Per&s;ons,</HI> and no Affair can be Tran&s;acted without 13, &s;o that if the Major part be Per&s;ons of Hone&s;ty and Con&s;cience, you are &s;ecure; nothing can be done unworthily. Yea if there &s;hould be but one Hone&s;t man of 13, yet you are &s;ure, &s;eeing &s;uch an act of knavery, as would defraud the <HI>Creditors,</HI> would be detected. The <HI>Gentleman</HI> tell us, (<HI>pag.</HI> 3.) <HI>You may &s;ue the Company on their common Seal, and have Execution again&s;t their Goods, but then asks where &s;hall you find the Goods of the Company to pay</HI> 5 s.
<PB N="5" REF="4"><HI>in the pound:</HI> and withall addes, <HI>That were there Goods of a greater value, the Company may divide them among&s;t them&s;elves, and &s;o the Creditors have never a penny, unle&s;s they can catch it in the</HI> Indies.</P>
<P>Since the E&s;tabli&s;hment of the <HI>Ea&s;t-India Company</HI> in this pre&s;ent <HI>joynt-&s;tock,</HI> which is now neer nineteen years, was ever any per&s;on that lent Money to the <HI>Company</HI> on their <HI>common</HI> Seal, forced to &s;ue them? Have not all men been payd their Money readily whenever they demand|ed it?</P>
<P>How is it po&s;&s;ible that the <HI>Companyes</HI> goods &s;hould be concealed, that mu&s;t pa&s;s through &s;o many hands, and are in &s;uch va&s;t quantities, and of &s;uch &s;orts as may ea&s;ily be di&s;tingui&s;hed from others? It hath been for|merly a <HI>Maxim</HI> among&s;t the <HI>Committee</HI> of that <HI>Company</HI> (as I have heard) never to take up more money at Intere&s;t, than they had reall Effects in <HI>England,</HI> in Debts or Goods to &s;atisfie. If for the la&s;t two years they have exceeded, to expatiate and extend the <HI>Trade</HI> for the Benefit of the <HI>Kingdom;</HI> It is however but for a very &s;mall time that it is otherwi&s;e, for at the arrival of their Ships from <HI>India</HI> in <HI>June, July,</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> they have con&s;tantly a va&s;t E&s;tate in <HI>England</HI> over and above what will an&s;wer all their Debts. And if there be not alwayes &s;o much at the latter end of <HI>March,</HI> when their Ships are di&s;peeded for <HI>India;</HI> in a few months after, when the former years Ships return, there is an abuudant Surplu&s;age. So that if it &s;hould fall out (which never yet hath done, nor is it probable it &s;hould) that any per&s;on &s;hould &s;ue the <HI>Company</HI> for Money lent them at Intere&s;t on their <HI>common Seal,</HI> and Execution again&s;t their Goods &s;hould be obtained, I &s;ay in &s;uch a Ca&s;e every per&s;on concerned, might ea&s;ily and without any difficulty find Effects in <HI>England,</HI> to di&s;charge all he can claim or challenge, nor is he left to <HI>find a thing in the Clouds, nor yet &s;end to India to catch it;</HI> which Expre&s;&s;ions the <HI>Gentleman</HI> might well have &s;pared.</P>
<P>That the <HI>Company</HI> &s;hould make a <HI>Divident</HI> among them&s;elves of their Goods and E&s;tate, to defraud their <HI>Creditors,</HI> is not onely very <HI>unchari|tably,</HI> but al&s;o very <HI>irrationally</HI> &s;ugge&s;ted. No <HI>Dividend</HI> can be made but by the <HI>Committee</HI> which (as before noted) con&s;i&s;ts of 26 <HI>Per&s;ons,</HI> and tho&s;e (or at lea&s;t mo&s;t of them) of the be&s;t <HI>Reputation</HI> for <HI>hone&s;ty</HI> and <HI>integrity</HI> in the <HI>City</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> and can it be in Charity &s;uppo&s;ed, that they would joyn in &s;uch an Act? I am confident they do abominate the thoughts of it. Be&s;ides it is not in the power of the <HI>Committee,</HI> accord|ing to their Con&s;titution, to make any <HI>Dividend</HI> in <HI>Goods.</HI> All <HI>Dividends</HI> are to be made in <HI>Money,</HI> and <HI>Goods</HI> are not to be &s;old by <HI>private Con|tract,</HI> but at a <HI>publick Sale.</HI> So that it is impo&s;&s;ible, according to the pre|&s;ent
<PB N="6" REF="5"><HI>Rules</HI> and con&s;titution of the <HI>Company,</HI> that any <HI>Dividend</HI> can be made to the prejudice of the <HI>Creditors,</HI> but they mu&s;t have &s;ufficient no|tice thereof, and may &s;ecure them&s;elves. But could it be imagined, that &s;uch <HI>Dividends</HI> might be made, and that the <HI>Committee</HI> &s;hould &s;o far degenerate from all Principles of Hone&s;ty, yet notwith&s;tanding what the <HI>Gentleman</HI> in&s;inuates, <HI>viz.</HI> That this might be done &s;o as to leave the <HI>Cre|ditor</HI> remedile&s;s in <HI>Law,</HI> I cannot believe, but rather think, the <HI>Gentle|man</HI> is mi&s;taken, and that he hath not well &s;tudied or con&s;idered the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>N.</HI> lends 1000 <HI>l.</HI> to the <HI>Ea&s;t-India Company</HI> on their <HI>common Seal,</HI> on this ground, that there is at that time a joynt-&s;tock of the Companyes, of the value of 900 thou&s;and pounds to &s;ecure and an&s;wer his Debt; the <HI>Committee</HI> divide this <HI>Stock</HI> of 900 thou&s;and pounds (after the lending of the Money) among&s;t them&s;elves and other the Members of the Com|pany: I now enquire, whether the <HI>Committee</HI> that made this <HI>Divident,</HI> be not in their own <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> and <HI>E&s;tates</HI> obliged in Law or Equity to an|&s;wer the Debt to <HI>N.</HI></P>
<P>For <HI>N.</HI> did not tru&s;t his Money on a vain Fancy, that the <HI>individual Members</HI> of the <HI>Company</HI> were in their private Capacities obliged to re&s;pond for his Money, but on this Foundation, That the <HI>joint-&s;tock</HI> of the <HI>Company</HI> was to be his Security and <HI>guarant.</HI> This <HI>joint-&s;tock</HI> was entru&s;ted into the hands of the <HI>Committee</HI> to manage for the Benefit of the <HI>Adventurers,</HI> before they took up Money at Intere&s;t; but when they had taken up Money at Intere&s;t, then the <HI>joynt-&s;tock</HI> is in the hands of the <HI>Committee</HI> in tru&s;t, in the fir&s;t place to an&s;wer and &s;atisfie the mo|neys taken up at intere&s;t: So that now the <HI>Committee</HI> are <HI>Tru&s;tees</HI> for <HI>N.</HI> till his Debt be payd. If Lo&s;&s;es and Accidents in the Cour&s;e of Trade &s;hould render the Stock incapable to an&s;wer the money to <HI>N.</HI> he mu&s;t be content to &s;it down by the lo&s;s; but if the Committee by any wilfull act of theirs di&s;po&s;e of the <HI>Stock,</HI> and convert it to their private u&s;e, before they have payd <HI>N,</HI> they are guilty of breach of tru&s;t, and thereby have rendred them&s;elves an&s;werable in their own <HI>private capacities</HI> to make &s;atisfaction to <HI>N.</HI> This was the opinion of one of the mo&s;t eminent and famous <HI>Lawyers</HI> of his time; (Serjeant <HI>Glyn;</HI>) and it &s;eems &s;o rational, that I am ea&s;ily per&s;waded to believe it to be &s;o. And were it but a doubtfull Ca&s;e, would it not be a mo&s;t imprudent act of the <HI>Committee,</HI> to divide the <HI>Stock</HI> among the <HI>Members</HI> of the <HI>Company,</HI> and expo&s;e them&s;elves in their own <HI>private capacities</HI> and <HI>E&s;tates</HI> to an&s;wer the <HI>Cre|ditors,</HI> or at lea&s;t to be liable to Suits and Mole&s;tations.</P>
<P>As to what the Gentleman ob&s;erves, (<HI>p.</HI> 4.) <HI>That the King who im|powered
<PB N="7" REF="5">the Company to u&s;e a common Seal, thought it not &s;ufficient &s;e|curity for his Cu&s;toms:</HI> But provided in their Patent that <HI>they &s;hould give good and &s;ufficient bond with &s;urety for the payment thereof.</HI> However, whether it be &s;o, or no, in the Patent, I know not; But this I'm well a&s;&s;ured of, that it &s;erves little to the purpo&s;e he intends it; it being evi|dent that tho&s;e words were not in&s;erted out of any doubt that either the <HI>King</HI> or his <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> had of the <HI>Companyes</HI> &s;ecurity by their <HI>common-Seal,</HI> but put in as words of cour&s;e, a form u&s;ual in &s;uch ca&s;es, for that the Kings Officers have never refu&s;ed, but alwayes readily accepted the <HI>Companyes</HI> Obligation by their <HI>common Seal,</HI> for the payment of the <HI>Cu&s;toms.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Gentleman</HI> believes, as he tells us, (<HI>pag.</HI> 5.) That <HI>the Company had never been &s;uch Bankers, as to have de&s;erved Court Letters about their Officers, if they had given Bond with Sureties for the Money they have borrowed.</HI> (p. 2.) It &s;eems what pa&s;&s;ed between the <HI>Court</HI> and the <HI>Company,</HI> was not &s;uch a <HI>Noli me tangere,</HI> but he would have one fling at it. To this he &s;ubjoyns a fooli&s;h in&s;ignificant pity, in reference to the <HI>Lombard-&s;treet Bankers,</HI> to which I &s;ay, that as I leave him to his own belief, &s;o for his pity, I am &s;ure I &s;hall never need it, upon the account of lending my money to the <HI>Company.</HI> Nor did the <HI>Gentlemans</HI> Friend de&s;erve a reproof, for not advi&s;ing with him before he parted with his money to the Company, though he might have had it &s;o unu&s;ually cheap.

<P>The <HI>Gentleman</HI> in the next place, that he may effectually carry on his De&s;ign, having in&s;inuated <HI>p.</HI> 5. That the <HI>Company hath no firm legal Foundation, and &s;o was in no probability of &s;tanding,</HI> gives us a <HI>Tran|&s;cript</HI> of &s;ome Clau&s;es in the <HI>Companies Charter,</HI> and then takes the liberty to arraign the <HI>Kings Grant;</HI> Calls it a <HI>Monopoly,</HI> and <HI>a Monopoly of Mo|nopolies;</HI> Quotes the <HI>Statute</HI> of 21 <HI>Jac. cap.</HI> 3. cites &s;ome <HI>Law-ca&s;es;</HI> talks of <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> and <HI>French Va&s;&s;als;</HI> tells us, that he wonders, yea <HI>pro|te&s;ts that he is a&s;toni&s;hed,</HI> to think <HI>how any dur&s;t draw &s;uch a patent;</HI> To omit other expre&s;&s;ions of the like, if not a wor&s;e complexion.</P>
<P>It would be improper for me, who you know am no Lawyer, to take upon me to an&s;wer the&s;e matters. The Gentleman is plea&s;ed to name
<PB N="8" REF="6">Mr. <HI>Solliciter,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Attorney General,</HI> and they are able to do it to purpo&s;e. However I am per&s;waded, notwith&s;tanding all the blu&s;ter and noi&s;e he makes, his zeal in the De&s;ign (rather than in his profe&s;&s;ion) hath carried him beyond his under&s;tanding, and that he is mi&s;taken in the whole matter. He quotes the Statute of 21 <HI>Jac. c.</HI> 3. as the Devil doth Scripture by halfes; for in the &s;aid Statute it is thus expre&s;&s;ed. <HI>Provid|ed al&s;o, and it is hereby further intended, declared, and enacted, that this Act, or any thing therein contained, &s;hall not in any wi&s;e extend, or be prejudiciall to the City of</HI> London, <HI>or to any City, Burrough, or Town Corporate within this Realm, for or concerning any Grants, Charters, or Letters Patents, to them or any of them, made or granted, or for or con|cerning, any Cu&s;tome or Cu&s;tomes, u&s;ed by or within them or any of them, Or to any Corporations or Fellow&s;hips of any Art Occupation or My&s;tery, or to any Companies or Societies of Merchants within this Realm, Erected for the Maintenance, Enlargement, or Ordering of any Trade of Merchan|di&s;e.

<P>The <HI>Gentleman</HI> gives us a Definition of a <HI>Monopoly,</HI> and then tells us (<HI>pag.</HI> 6.) <HI>the Statute provides that all Per&s;ons, Bodies Politick and Corporate, which then were or thence after &s;hould be, &s;hould &s;tand, and be di&s;abled, to have u&s;e, or exerci&s;e, or put in u&s;e any &s;uch Monopolies.</HI> The word <HI>&s;uch,</HI> is not in the <HI>Statute</HI> in that place; and if we take the &s;ub&s;equent words in that Statute, to Define or Explain what a <HI>Monopoly</HI> is; It refers only to matters within the <HI>Realm,</HI> which will not concern the pre&s;ent ca&s;e.

<PB N="9" REF="6">of the <HI>King,</HI> who hath the undoubted Prerogative of making War and Peace, upon which the &s;ame depends.

But in &s;ome Ca&s;es, and under &s;ome Circum|&s;tances, hath not his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> a Prerogative (nay, ought he not on the &s;ame right of Fatherhood) as to prefer the <HI>General</HI> Benefit, to that of <HI>Particular;</HI> &s;o &s;ometimes to extend &s;peciall <HI>Priviledges</HI> and <HI>Grants</HI> to &s;ome <HI>Particulars</HI> for the <HI>General Benefit,</HI> though other particulars may &s;eem to receive prejudice thereby?

<PB N="11" REF="7">to pay their Debts, by <HI>being condemn'd in Treble dammages, or fined at the Common Laws for accepting &s;uch a Patent,</HI> (p. 9.) to which our Barri&s;ter, without under&s;tanding, (if not without con&s;ulting his Books) thinks them lyable.</P>
<P>The Gentleman in the clo&s;e of his Letter would in&s;inuate, that the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade is of no Benefit to the Nation, and if it were, yet that it might be more advantageou&s;ly mannaged than by a Company in a Joynt-Stock. This I gue&s;s to be his meaning, but le&s;t I &s;hould mi&s;take, I will repeat his own words, pag. 10. <HI>I that am no Trader know that the Parliament could, if it be an u&s;efull Trade to</HI> England, <HI>(which I am no proper Judge of) have e&s;tabli&s;hed legally &s;uch Rules whereby the Trade, might have been managed, and Factories, Forts, and Ca&s;tles maintained; and the liberty of Trade might have been pre&s;erved to every Engli&s;h-man, and five times the trade gained, and the price of our own Manufactures of Cloath and others advanced, by the multitude and freedom of Buyers; and the price of the goods imported much le&s;&s;ened to the Engli&s;h, and much more Trade with the&s;e Commodities gained into other parts of the World. An In&s;tance of this is well known in the Turkey Company, where no Merchant can be excluded or denyed to trade with their particular Stock; yet the &s;ame pretence might have been for re&s;traint, that &s;ome do vainly &s;ugge&s;t in this.</HI></P>
<P>Who is &s;o bold as blind <HI>Bayard?</HI> they that know lea&s;t, are apt to think they know mo&s;t. Ignorance and Confidence are often Compani|ons. The Gentleman tells us, though he be no <HI>Trader, yet he knows.</HI> what doth he know? he doth not know whether the <HI>Trade</HI> to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> be an <HI>u&s;eful Trade</HI> to <HI>England;</HI> that he is not a proper Judge of, as he &s;aith. He might with little &s;tudy or ob&s;ervation have known, that it's a <HI>Trade</HI> all <HI>Nations</HI> have and do court at the highe&s;t rate: A <HI>Trade</HI> that the <HI>Dutch</HI> have adventured their All to purcha&s;e; A <HI>Trade</HI> which as it is carryed on onely by a <HI>Company</HI> in the way of <HI>Joynt-&s;tock,</HI> &s;o the gain thereby accrewing, maintains the <HI>Republick</HI> in Honour, Pow|er, and Opulency; A <HI>Trade</HI> whereby they have &s;o encrea&s;ed to Riches and Strength, as almo&s;t to become Ma&s;ters of the World: A <HI>Trade</HI> wherein the <HI>Engli&s;h Company</HI> employ and maintain above forty Ships, from 3 to 500 Tuns, and upwards of 3000 <HI>Sea-men;</HI> a <HI>Trade</HI> that &s;upplyes the <HI>Nation</HI> with nece&s;&s;ary Commodities, at a tenth part of the price the Nation mu&s;t otherwi&s;e pay for them. <HI>Pepper</HI> would be as dear as <HI>Nutmegs,</HI> if the <HI>Dutch</HI> were &s;ole Ma&s;ters of it; <HI>Callico</HI> mu&s;t be &s;upplyed by <HI>French, Dutch</HI> and <HI>Flanders</HI> Linnen; A <HI>Trade</HI> that makes us Ma&s;ters of the <HI>Salt-petre,</HI> enables us to defend our &s;elves, frees our
<PB N="12" REF="8">hou&s;es from tho&s;e Vermin, (the Salt-petre-men) that dug up our roomes; A <HI>Trade</HI> that upholds our forreign Trades, by bringing us Commodities to carry abroad to <HI>France, Spain, Italy, and Turkey,</HI> to a farther in|crea&s;e of our Navigation. A <HI>Trade</HI> that be&s;ides the <HI>Cu&s;tomes</HI> to his <HI>Ma|je&s;ty,</HI> which are very con&s;iderable, brings an <HI>Annual Addition,</HI> of &s;eve|ral 100000 pounds to the real <HI>Stock</HI> of the <HI>Kingdom.</HI> There are be&s;ides the&s;e, divers other advantages, too many to enumerate. All this is &s;o per&s;picuous, that the <HI>Gentleman</HI> might ea&s;ily have di&s;cerned it, were his &s;ight clear, and not clouded by prejudice, or ob&s;tructed by the in|tervention of &s;ome private (if not forrein) intere&s;t. But though he knows not whether the Trade be u&s;efull for <HI>England,</HI> yet he knows if it were, the <HI>Parliament could have e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;uch rules, &amp;c.</HI> Excellent! how comes it to pa&s;s the <HI>Parliament</HI> hath not done it all this while? The Rea&s;on is &s;ugge&s;ted, It was not an u&s;efull trade for <HI>England.</HI> But might it not have been made an u&s;efull Trade, If &s;uch Rules had been made to have gained 5 times the Trade, to have advanced the price of our Manu|factures, and le&s;&s;ened the price of Goods imported, and have gained much more trade into other parts of the World? Certainly the <HI>Parliament</HI> hath not been of the <HI>Gentlemans</HI> mind, neither to have Judged the Trade u&s;ele&s;s, For then they would have put it down; Nor yet to think that &s;uch <HI>Rules</HI> as he Imagines could have been made to effect what he fancies, for then they would have e&s;tabli&s;hed them. The Gentleman might have done well for the Benefit of his Countrey (if he intended it) to have &s;ug|ge&s;ted (if he could) what the&s;e <HI>Rules</HI> were, that they might have been con&s;idered; and till he declares what <HI>Rules</HI> he means, I can make no o|ther con&s;truction of his words, than that he knows that the Parliament, could have made &s;uch Rules, though he knows not what. I Readily grant, the <HI>Parliament,</HI> (which is the Wi&s;dome, and Supream Authority of the Nation) can and will make all nece&s;&s;ary rules for the good of the Kingdome, and to &s;ay &s;uch Rules could have been made and yet never were, (though many <HI>Parliaments</HI> have been &s;ince the fir&s;t E&s;tabli&s;hment of the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade) &s;eems too much to reflect on that great A&s;&s;em|bly. The <HI>Gentleman</HI> tells us, an <HI>in&s;tance of this is well known in the Turkey Company.</HI> An In&s;tance of what? that the <HI>Parliament</HI> could have E&s;tabli&s;hed &s;uch <HI>Rules</HI> as to have gained 5 times, the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade? &s;ure that cannot be the meaning; the Parliament having never made any Rules, much le&s;s &s;uch <HI>Rules</HI> for the <HI>Turkey Company.</HI> The Gentleman &s;ure was &s;o a&s;toni&s;hed, that he was in a <HI>Labyrinth,</HI> and lo&s;t his &s;en&s;es.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="8">
<P>To help him therefore out, though this be no In&s;tance of the Parlia|ments making <HI>Rules,</HI> yet may it not be an In&s;tance, that if the <HI>Ea&s;t-In|dia Company</HI> did admit all Merchants to trade with their particular Stocks, (as he &s;aith the <HI>Turkey</HI> Company do, though therein he mi&s;takes; for its only their own Members that have liberty,) it would have increa&s;ed and augmented the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade five times more than now it is? This certainly mu&s;t be the thing he intended, yet I cannot find how it is an in|&s;tance. The <HI>Turkey</HI> Company never were in a <HI>Joynt-&s;tock</HI> (that not be|ing &s;o nece&s;&s;ary and &s;uitable to that Trade) &s;o it could never be known what Increa&s;e the alteration from one to the other would have made; and it is evident, that the <HI>Ea&s;t-India Trade</HI> hath been more increa&s;ed and in|larged within the&s;e few years under a <HI>Joynt-&s;tock,</HI> than the <HI>Turkey-trade</HI> hath been under a <HI>Regulation.</HI> It is al&s;o certain (as before noted) that the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade in three or four years time of open Trade was almo&s;t totally ruined, and could not have been upheld &s;o much to the <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> and Benefit of the Kingdom, unle&s;s it had been reduced into a <HI>Company, and Joynt-&s;tock.</HI></P>
<P>The Inconfi&s;tency of maintaining and carrying on the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> trade in a Regulation without a Company and a Joynt &s;tock, the great mi&s;chief and ruine it might be to the Kingdom, both in point of Wealth and Strength (which includes all,) If we &s;hould lo&s;e or be cheated of that Trade, and what may be further done for the &s;ecuring and augmenting of it, are Subjects would require larger Di&s;cour&s;es than my time at pre&s;ent will admit of. I hope, Sir, what I have &s;aid, may be enough to &s;atisfie you, that the <HI>Joynt-&s;tock</HI> of the <HI>Ea&s;t-India Company</HI> is a <HI>&s;ufficient &s;ecurity,</HI> and that the &s;aid Company is neither &s;o obnoxious, nor my &s;elf or others that have lent Money to them, &s;o ill advi&s;ed, as the <HI>Gentleman</HI> in his Letter would in&s;inuate.
