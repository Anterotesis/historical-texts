<HEAD>THE
Author's Preface.</HEAD>
<P>IF I had taken the lea&s;ure to make a
&s;erious Reflection on the boldne&s;s of
my de&s;ign, I had not publi&s;ht this Ac|count
of my Voyages; the raw Age in
which I made them, had been a &s;ufficient
rea&s;on to di&s;courage me from it, be&s;ides
the con&s;ideration of the polite Age we
live in. For tho' I have followed Truth
with the greate&s;t &s;everity, yet the&s;e Re|lations
want perhaps tho&s;e other Advan|tages
that are apt to recommend things
of this nature to the Reader, &s;uch as Air
and Stile in the writing of them, &s;o much
valued at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Yet however devoid of the&s;e Ornaments,
I &s;hall venture to pre&s;ent them to the
Publick, after &s;o ingenious an acknowledg|ment,
in hopes the young Traveller will
meet with a mild and ea&s;y cen&s;ure of his
fir&s;t attempts, while he gives the Publick
a mo&s;t exact account of the particulars of
Mon&s;ieur <HI>Duque&s;ne</HI>'s Voyage and Under|takings
in the <HI>Indies,</HI> which has been &s;o
earne&s;tly and impatiently expected; of his
<PB REF="3">
Engagements with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch;</HI>
with the Advantages he has gain'd of them;
and his Conduct in bringing back a Squa|dron
&s;afe with which his Maje&s;ty entru|&s;ted
him, through a Voyage of &s;ix Thou&s;and
Leagues, through Storms and Tempe&s;ts, and
all the rage and power of the Enemy.</P>
<P>Perhaps the Reader will be pleas'd with
the variety of the Subject with which I
have furni&s;ht this Relation, which can't
but render it the more agreable and en|tertaining;
as likewi&s;e with &s;ome Re|marks
curious enough, concerning the va|rious
Nations and Countries thro' which
we pa&s;t, and the horrible Tempe&s;t that &s;ur|priz'd
us in our return in the Latitude of
<HI>Ma&s;carin.</HI> I have writ all in the natural
order in which they fell out, with exact|ne&s;s
and fidelity, obliging my &s;elf to omit
nothing of moment, and to relate no|thing
of which I was not an Eye-wit|ne&s;s:
So after acquainting the Reader
before hand with &s;ome Repetitions, which
by a frequent recurring of the &s;ame things
were unavoidable, I have nothing more to
de&s;ire for his &s;atisfaction, or my own ad|vantage,
but that the &s;tile had been more
polite and correct, there being nothing el&s;e
wanting to compleat his &s;atisfaction.</P>

<P>THE Squadron thus Arm'd, had
not been Ten Days before the
I&s;le of <HI>Groge,</HI> when Orders came from
Court to Sail immediately. So <HI>Fri|day</HI>
the 24th of <HI>February</HI> (90,) Mon&s;ieur
<HI>Duque&s;ne</HI> coming aboard at Five in the
Evening, weighed Anchor, after
giving the parting Guns; we pre&s;ent|ly
were under Sail, with the Wind at
<HI>North,</HI> and a delicate Gale as could
be wi&s;h'd, but it did not la&s;t long,
coming about at Ten next Morning;
&s;o that we were obliged to put back
again; but by the 27th we Sailed a|gain,
<PB N="5" REF="7">
the Wind being more favourable
than at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>We made &s;uch way, that we &s;oon
lo&s;t &s;ight of Land, which we were
not like to &s;ee again in a good while:
The Wind contiued &s;o favourable, that
by the Tenth of <HI>March</HI> we doubled
<HI>Cape Fene&s;ter:</HI> The Sea is commonly
Boy&s;terous in this Latitude, and the
pa&s;&s;age dangerous, and there's no
bearing much Sail here.</P>
<P>The Sixth Day became remarkable,
by an Accident that happen'd to us.
The Gabier, who is one appointed to
look to the Ma&s;ts and Tackling, hang|ing
on the Forema&s;t Sail-yard, un|hapily
fell into the Sea, which was
then very boi&s;terous; we did all we
could to &s;ave him, threw out Ropes,
hoi&s;ted out the Boat, but all in vain,
for the Storm was &s;o violent, that he
&s;unk pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>Great are the terrors of this Ele|ment,
and there is nothing apter to
make a Man &s;erious, when he con&s;i|ders
there is but a Plank between him

<P>WE Steer'd our Cour&s;e for the
<HI>Madera</HI> I&s;lands, where with
plea&s;ure, we waited to take in &s;ome
refre&s;hments, tho' 'twas not above
Nine Days that we had lo&s;t &s;ight of
Land. But the Currents which we
met having carried us too far to the
<HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> or rather to the great Foggs at
Land, having hinder'd us from the
&s;ight of it; we left it to the Right,
without perceiving it, till we had
doubled it. The 9th we di&s;covered
the I&s;le of <HI>Savages,</HI> which was the
fir&s;t Land we made &s;ince we parted
from <HI>Port-Lewis;</HI> 'tis &s;cituated in 30
Degrees of the <HI>Northern</HI> Latitude, and
Twenty Minutes Longitude. This is
an uninhabited I&s;land, very dangerous
for the Steep Craggy Rocks that in|viron
it for above a League; that
<PB N="7" REF="8">
&s;carce a Boat can go a Shoar; by this
&s;ight of Land we judged we were
not far from the <HI>Canary</HI> I&s;lands, which
doubtle&s;s we &s;hould have come to
&s;ight of, the next Morning, if we had
not been delay'd by a Calm, which
happily la&s;ted but a little while; for,
in the Evening it began to blow a brisk
Gale, &s;o that by the Eleventh, at 7 a
Clock in the Morning, we were with|in
Thirteen Lagues of the Pike of
<HI>Teneriffe.</HI></P>
<P>By Noon we were near it, being in
Twenty Eight Degrees, Thirty Six
Minutes, <HI>North</HI> Latitude, and Three
Hundred and Fifty Nine Degrees of
Longitude. The Pike of <HI>Teneriffe</HI> is
&s;een Forty Leagues off, and undoubt|edly
may pa&s;s for one of the highe&s;t
Mountains in the World. Some make
it &s;even Leagues high, others Twelve.
This proud Mountain wraps its head
in the Clouds, which appears white,
by rea&s;on of the Snow that covers
it Winter and Summer, ri&s;ing through
the middle Region of the Air, which
makes it &s;o cold that none was ever
able to mount it.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="9">
Behind this Mountain &s;tands the
Town of <HI>Canary,</HI> of which the I&s;land
bears the Name; which is very Fruit|ful,
and abounds in Corn, and is fa|mous
for the rich Wines it produces,
which are carried to all Parts of the
World. Three are be&s;ides Three o|ther
I&s;lands; the fir&s;t, that of <HI>Gomer,</HI>
of the &s;ame &s;ide with the Pike, and
not above Six or Seven Leagues di&s;tant.
The &s;econd is <HI>Palm</HI> I&s;land, memorable
for the Death of Forty Je&s;uits, who
going to <HI>Brazill,</HI> to Preach the Faith
of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, were there Martyr'd
by the <HI>Calvini&s;ts,</HI> about a Hundred
Years ago. This latter is oppo&s;ite to
the Pike of <HI>Teneriffe,</HI> and is about
Twelve or Thirteen Leagues di&s;tant.
We pa&s;t between the&s;e two, having
<HI>Palme</HI> I&s;land on the Right, and the
Pike of <HI>Teneriffe</HI> on the Left. And
the la&s;t is the I&s;le of <HI>Fer,</HI> where Geo|graphers
commonly place the fir&s;t
<HI>Meridian.</HI> The&s;e four I&s;lands belong
to <HI>Spain,</HI> &s;o that we could not take a

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The different Opinions concerning the Trading Winds.</HEAD>
<P>THe Wind which had hardly &s;tir'd
all day, began to blow fre&s;h in
the Evening, &s;o that we cou'd ea&s;ily
perceive the Trading Winds, which are
&s;o u&s;eful for Sailing; they are call'd
&s;o by rea&s;on of their continuing three
or four months without changing. The&s;e
&s;ort of Winds Blow always from the
North Ea&s;t in the Southern parts, and
from the South Ea&s;t in the Northern
parts, which very much perplexes cu|rious
people to find out the true rea|&s;on
of it. Some maintain, that the
Trading Winds are no other then
tho&s;e which blow from the We&s;t, and
the North with great violence, which
pa&s;&s;ing over <HI>Europe</HI> to the Ea&s;t and
South, rarify and grow weaker as
they approach the warmer Cli|mates;
on the contrary, in the Sou|thern
<PB N="10" REF="10">
parts, the We&s;tern and Southern
Winds blowing with the &s;ame vio|lence
towards <HI>Africa,</HI> are thence dri|ven
towards the Ea&s;t and North, and
abate by degrees as they approach the
warmths of the Line, and quite cea&s;e
when they reach it.</P>
<P>Others explain this matter after a
different manner; they will have it,
that the exce&s;&s;ive heats of the Line
draw the&s;e Winds from the Poles,
where the Exhalations and Vapors,
which are the matter of the Winds,
being &s;tronger and in greater abun|dance
cau&s;e more violent and la&s;ting
ones, and that afterwards the&s;e Winds
or Exhalations are drawn towards the
Zone, and there abated by the exce&s;|&s;ive
heat.</P>
<P>Behold the be&s;t Account I could
meet with, to &s;atisfy tho&s;e who are
curious in this matter; but whatever
the Natural Cau&s;e of them may be, it
may be truly &s;aid, they are the &s;weet|e&s;t

&s;ome of our men have bought an Ox

<P>They were no le&s;s careful to &s;upply

if it were not for the inacc&s;&s;ible Moun|tains.
The <HI>Orange</HI> and <HI>Lemon</HI> Trees

nor &s;ize of a true natural Orange.</P>
<P>The I&s;land produces be&s;ides, ex|cellent
Rice and Mill, thrice as large
as that of <HI>France,</HI> and were it more
even and compact, would be very fit
to live in. It &s;eems to be but thinly
peopl'd, for I &s;aw but one Village,
of about three&s;core or four&s;core cot|tages,
made and cover'd with branches
of <HI>Palm,</HI> under which the <HI>Negro's</HI> lie;
the entrance into them is &s;o low, that

they &s;leep on Mats of rice &s;traw,
which they lay on the ground; one
&s;ees nothing here which does not ar|gue
the mi&s;erable life the&s;e Savages
lead.</P>
<P>Taking a view of this Village,
I had the curio&s;ity to enter into a
wretched Hutt, built of &s;tone and &s;and;
which they told me was a Pagod, or
Temple, in which the&s;e wretches wor|&s;hip
an Oxe's head, the forehead being
in&s;crib'd with <HI>Arabick</HI> characters; they
made him a grot in the wall, adorn'd
with &s;hell work, where they plac'd
this reverend Divinity, and which
they remov'd a little after we went in,
whither 'twas they believ'd us unwor|thy
to look on't, or that they ob&s;erv'd
we &s;lighted it as much as it de&s;erv'd:
The middle of the Pagod was matted,
and on the right &s;ide as you enter,
there was a pole &s;tuck in the ground
forkt at one end, &s;upporting &s;ome
mother of pearl burnt; on the in&s;ide,
which I &s;uppo&s;e &s;erv'd for a lamp;
and a little lower of the &s;ame &s;ide,
was a &s;tair-ca&s;e of 5 &s;teps, leading to
the place where the King &s;its.</P>

eat, drink, or &s;moak 'till the &s;un's
&s;et, and they are &s;o exact in't, that
no per&s;wa&s;ions or threats can make
'em do otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Negro's</HI> appear'd more Savage
than they of <HI>Saintiague,</HI> ruder in their
manner of living, but more plain in
their dealing; they are large, and
&s;trong bodied, but very fearful; a
Pi&s;tol &s;hot will &s;care them &s;o, that
they'll run into the woods to hide,
&s;o much they fear fire Arms. They
were long beards, and their hair cover|ing
their &s;houlders; for 'tis to be ob|&s;erv'd,
that to the &s;outh of the Line,
they all have them thus, and to the
North, have &s;hort friz'd hair; they
all go naked, having only a rag of
Linen to cover their nakedne&s;s,
and &s;ome wear beads about their
necks without cro&s;&s;es, and holes in
<PB N="43" REF="26">
their Ears that your finger will go
through.</P>
<P>I could never imagine that the&s;e
Savages could be &s;o jealous of their

Cottages as we pa&s;t by, that we
might not &s;ee them, judging our in|clinations
I &s;uppo&s;e by their own;
we &s;aw, &s;ome of their women who

from their Men, but by their habit;
which con&s;i&s;ts of a piece of Linen that
cro&s;&s;es their Stomacks, and &s;o falls
down their brea&s;ts, with another which
binds their Thghes behind and before
like drawers: They are very wild,
for when I but touch'd one of their
ears, to ob&s;erve three little pieces of
wood &s;he had in them, &s;he skriekt
out, and ran as if I intended to eat
her.</P>
<P>Tho' Idolaters, yet they are very
temperate and &s;ober; and for the mo&s;t
part feed only on fi&s;h, fruits and Rice,
and rarely eat any fle&s;h, tho' they
have plenty. Their be&s;t drink is
<HI>Tarry,</HI> which is very refre&s;hing, and

&s;ent an arm'd &s;loup with an Officer,

<P>It might be now about eleven a

to the <HI>Rock</HI> with the&s;e orders; Mon|&s;ieut
<HI>de Pouriere,</HI> the Captain of it,
&s;ent us a young <HI>Malouin</HI> Seaman, who
made his e&s;cape from aboard the ene|my
by &s;wiming, and had come aboard
him, after his &s;econd di&s;charge.</P>
<P>This man inform'd us, that the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Captain, after giving all his
men a large bowl of Canary, exhorted
them to fight it out to the la&s;t; tell|ing
them at the &s;ame time too, that
he was re&s;olv'd to &s;et fire to the &s;hip
before ever it &s;hould fall into our hands,
<PB N="52" REF="31">
if we prov'd to be <HI>French;</HI> which he
but too well perform'd, as you'l &s;ee
by what follows. The &s;hips name
was the <HI>Herbert&punc;</HI> built for eighty
Guns; carrying but 54; and two
hunderd and fifty men, with about
four&s;core pa&s;&s;engers, among&s;t whom
was a rich <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bankrupt, who had
four&s;core thou&s;and crowns in &s;ilver,
having with him his wife and a daugh|ter,
a great beauty about twenty years
old, with two young &s;ons, one of
which was born under the Line.</P>
<P>He told us the Cargo of the &s;hip
con&s;i&s;ted of Laces, and Brocard of
gold, &s;carlet cloaths, Bevers, Iron, To|bacco,
Canary wines, and a great
deal of Money; ordered for commerce,
and paying off the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;oldiers
in the &s;ervice of the Company, who
had receiv'd no pay in four years time,
and that if taken would prove a va&s;t
rich Prize, which very much rejoyc'd
us. But the de&s;perate Captain took
care that none &s;hould be the richer for't,
or gain by what he lo&s;t.</P>
<P>So we gave over firing in good time,
for be&s;ides that it &s;ignify'd nothing;
we &s;hould a done our &s;elves as much
<PB N="53" REF="31">
damage as the enemy; at length he
made four or five &s;hot at us, to waken
our Squadron out of that profound
&s;teep it &s;eem'd to have been in, and
then lay &s;till; and continuing &s;o for
&s;ome time, about two in the morning
the wind blowing fre&s;h, &s;he made all
the &s;ail &s;he could to e&s;cape the ap|proaching
danger.</P>
<P>He thought the &s;ame happine&s;s
would have attended him now; which
he had had at the <HI>Canary</HI> I&s;lands,
where its &s;aid he clear'd him&s;elf of
three &s;tout <HI>Algerines</HI> that &s;urrounded
him; but he &s;oon found to the con|trary,
for he was no &s;ooner under &s;ail,
but we began to follow him, when
&s;eeing there was no po&s;&s;ibillity of e&s;cap|ing,
and that as &s;oon as 'twas day, we
&s;hould bear down upon him in a line,
and &s;ink him; Fir'd with rage and de&s;|pair,
he took the mo&s;t cruel re&s;oluti|on
in the world; and without any more
delay &s;et fire to his &s;hip, placing two
che&s;ts of powder under the highe&s;t
part of the &s;tern, near the Mizzen
Ma&s;t; making his e&s;cape him&s;elf thro'
the Gunners room in his boat, in which
they perceiv'd a light, but he endea|vour'd
<PB N="54" REF="32">
to hide it that they might not
follow him.</P>
<P>This dreadful &s;pectacle amaz'd us ex|ceedingly,
and as eargerly as we endea|vour'd
to attack her before, as ha&s;tily we
attempted to avoid her now; our men
lookt on't as belonging to them&s;elves;
and could not but cen&s;ure the Cap|tain,
for acting &s;o cruel and inhumane
a part, as not to &s;ave his Cargo, or
peri&s;h with them him&s;elf. But this
horrible proceeding quite ruin'd the
opinion, we had before conceiv'd of
his bravery.</P>
<P>Some of our men heard the&s;e mi&s;er|able
people crying out like the damn'd,
and runing up the bolt &s;prit in crowds,
endeavouring to avoid the flames,
which rag'd &s;o violenty, but 'twas in
vain. The &s;hip continually burning
for three hours, when at length the
flames catching in the powder room,
it blew up all at once; &s;o that in le&s;s
than half a quarter of an hour there
was nothing to be &s;een of that rich
&s;hip, but dreadful conflagration.</P>
<P>Our &s;ingle &s;hip fir'd for her &s;hare
no le&s;s than 200 and 80 guns, and we
had five men kill'd and &s;ix wounded;

to be &s;een throughout the whole Ve&s;&s;el
but the perfect picture of a &s;hipwrack,
to which the winds and Seas &s;eem'd
to con&s;pire; this night we had the
the <HI>Jack Staff</HI> carried away by one
&s;ingle Wave.</P>
<P>We waited for day Break with more
impatience than our Friends for our
Return&punc; as tho' 'twould alay the &s;torm,
<PB N="158" REF="86">
or re&s;cue us from danger; at la&s;t it
came, but alas it only &s;erv'd to give
us a clearer &s;ight of our Mi&s;ery, &s;o
that <HI>Friday</HI> in the morning, the wind
and the &s;eas having abated nothing of
their rage, but &s;till encrea&s;ing; and
finding our &s;elves quite &s;pent, we
with horror beheld the Wild and al|mo&s;t
inevitable death that waited for
us.</P>
<P>We had recour&s;e to GOD as the
only means left, and with tears in
our Eyes, and terror in our Hearts,
we implor'd his Infinite Goodne&s;s,
by the &s;uffrages of the Ble&s;&s;ed Vir|gin,
and St. <HI>Jo&s;eph;</HI> whom we pray'd
to interpo&s;e their credit to obtain
mercy for us. In the mean time
we ply'd four pumps continually,
and having di&s;cover'd two great Leaks,
the one afore, the other aff't we were
oblieg'd to make a well in the bottom
of the keel, and to draw the water
thence with Buckets and Pails to pre|vent
&s;inking.</P>
<P>'Twas &s;trange, that tho' watching
and fa&s;ting had quite &s;pent us; yet
we &s;hou'd gather &s;trength out of our
very weakne&s;s, and work and toil on,
<PB N="159" REF="86">
without &s;o much as reflecting on our
mi&s;erable condition; each of us thought
of nothing but di&s;puting his life, which
he &s;aw pre&s;t and attackt with a thou|&s;and
dangers at once.</P>
<P>We continued thus toyling in our
Mi&s;ery, till four in the evening, when
not knowing what farther cour&s;e to
take to &s;ave our &s;elves, or to re&s;i&s;t the
violence of the &s;torm, we a &s;econd time
adre&s;t our &s;elves to GOD, vowing
upon a deliverance to have a Service,
or each his particular Ma&s;s &s;aid at
St. <HI>Anns</HI> in <HI>Auray.</HI></P>
<P>We crept up upon the Deck, and
our <HI>Almoner</HI> on his knees, under
the quarter deck, as did all the re&s;t
invok the aid and mercy of Heaven,
in the name of two hundred and fifty
Saints more, who poured out their
Souls in the &s;ame devotion, implor|ing
the mercy of GOD; never was a
more moving Spectacle &s;een, and I
then with horror read our ruin in the
di&s;paring looks of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Duque&s;ne,</HI>
who kneeling on his bed, and looking
fixedly on the raging Seas, mounting
high in the air, and threatning us
with ruin, &s;eem'd to tell us there was
<PB N="160" REF="87">
no more hopes left but in the immedi|ate
Favour of Heaven: The Vow be|ing
made, he let him&s;elf fall on his
bed, &s;aying his only hopes were in
the Infinite mercy of GOD, and that
'twas invain to &s;trive any longer.</P>
<P>This, I own threw me into the la&s;t
de&s;pair, yet we were re&s;olv'd to try
once more what we could do; re&s;olv|ing
to &s;ave our &s;elves, or peri&s;h; we
try'd to hoi&s;t a &s;econd time our fore|ma&s;t
&s;ail, where we us'd care in tak|ing
of the ri&s;e; each with fear and
impatience waited the &s;ucce&s;s of a
cour&s;e, that was either to &s;ave or ruin
us; and at this very time we were
quite con&s;um'd with the labour of the
mercile&s;s Sea.</P>
<P>A little after a Seaman, whom the
Sea had &s;wept out of the &s;hip, was
thrown in again by the Waves, and
&s;av'd.</P>
<P>But GOD at la&s;t &s;how'd us mercy,
and pitty, and was pleas'd to put an
end to all our Fatigues and &s;ufferings;
for unfurling the forema&s;t &s;ail, it re|&s;i&s;ted
the wind; when full of joy and
acknowledgement for &s;o vi&s;ible a pro|tection,
we began to pur&s;ue our way;
<PB N="161" REF="87">
and in our turn, triumphing over
tho&s;e Waves that had &s;o in&s;ulted us
for two days together.</P>
<P>We ran thus the re&s;t of the night,
and next day, being <HI>Saturday,</HI> the
wind began to alter about four in the
morning; &s;o that at break of day we &s;aw
our &s;elves out of that danger, which
continually threatned us for eight and
forty hours together, without &s;leeping,
or eating, or drinking, &s;ave a little
Bi&s;cuit and Rack.</P>
<P>When we had &s;topt the two leakes
as well as we could, we fell to &s;ettling
all things in the in&s;ide of the &s;hip,
that were in confu&s;ion; for nothing
cou'd be &s;een but Che&s;ts and Arms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
&s;catter'd up and down; fowls and
bea&s;ts drown'd; in &s;hort, an Emblem

taking breath, began to provide for
him&s;elf, &s;ome pre&s;t with hunger, be|gan
to &s;earch for Victuals; but the
kitchins being &s;poiled we could have
none dre&s;t in three days time; and
others almo&s;t dead for want of &s;leep,
fell to drying their beds and cloaths
in the Sun.</P>

greatful than the &s;ight of the Sun to us,

<P>The third of <HI>April,</HI> I remember

<P>This Mon&s;trous creature does not
&s;hun Men, as other fi&s;h do, for he no

where I ob&s;erv'd one thing that was
very extraordinary: The Birds which
&s;tood thick on the Rocks, &s;uffered us
to come &s;o near them, that we might
take them with our hands, and I
&s;tooping to gather &s;ome Pur&s;loine,
&s;everal hovering round my head,
came and pearcht on my Hat, of
which I took four alive, and kill'd
two more with my Cane.</P>
<P>The great numbers of the&s;e Birds,
de&s;troy the young Tortoi&s;es as &s;oon
as hatch'd, for they love their fle&s;h &s;o
<PB N="176" REF="96">
well, that they are continually pur|&s;uing
them; and before they leave the
Egg, or are able to gain the Sea, or
&s;wim on the &s;urface of the Water;
they kill them with their Beaks; but
after they are grown bigger, the light|ne&s;s
of their &s;hell makes them &s;wim
with more &s;trength, and defends them
from the&s;e Birds of Prey. Yet not|with&s;tanding
this va&s;t de&s;truction of
them, their number is immen&s;e; the
Tortoi&s;e being one of tho&s;e Creatures,
that multiply mo&s;t. Nor will they ad|mire
at it, who con&s;ider it as one of
the large&s;t fi&s;h, that has its Nutri|ment
from this Element.</P>
<P>Its &s;hape and colour being known
by mo&s;t people, I thought it unne|ce&s;&s;ary
to give you a particular de|&s;cription
of it here; I &s;hall only &s;ay,
that its head re&s;embles that of an
Eagle, and the Fins, which are about
a foot and half long, are hid under
their Shells: And for that rea&s;on,
when the <HI>Requiems</HI> (a fi&s;h I have men|tioned
before) meet with the Tortoi&s;es,
they always &s;eize upon that part fir&s;t,
and &s;o kill them; their Shell being
but thin, and uncapable of re&s;i&s;ting
<PB N="177" REF="97">
&s;o great a &s;trength, as that of the <HI>Re|quiem:</HI>
This Battle I have often &s;een
my &s;elf, and &s;o can the better atte&s;t
the truth of it.</P>
<P>Some who have been ill inform'd,
have &s;aid, that they make u&s;e of their
Paws in fighting, as the Land Tor|toi&s;es
do; but nothing is more fal&s;e
than this, they having nothing like
a Paw, only a few Prickles at the end
of their Fins, which they Crawl a&s;hoar
with, and dig holes in the ground to
lay their Eggs in; which having done,
they immediately return to Sea again,
leaving them covered, to be hatch'd
by the warmth of the Sun.</P>
<P>Great care and diligence mu&s;t be
u&s;ed in the taking of them, for they
are very quick-&s;ighted, you mu&s;t
range your &s;elf in the night, in &s;eve|ral
places of the Creek, where they
are known to come a&s;hoar, and when
you perceive them at a &s;ufficient di|&s;tance
from the Water, run to 'em and
throw 'em on their backs, and then
'tis impo&s;&s;ible for 'em to ri&s;e again.</P>
<P>The Tortoi&s;es that are taken at the
I&s;le of <HI>A&s;cention,</HI> are the bigge&s;t that
ever I &s;aw; there are &s;ome that weigh
<PB N="178" REF="97">
three or four hundred weight, &s;uffici|ent
to feed &s;o many men at a time;
the fle&s;h is very whol&s;om and delicate,
and the Eggs, which are exactly round,
and are found in great quantities a|long
the coa&s;t, are almo&s;t as big as an
Hen's, but their &s;hells are &s;o thick, that
if you throw them again&s;t the ground,
they will rebound without breaking.</P>

<HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the 9th of <HI>April</HI> 1682. I
embark'd with four Sons of a Family
which went with us: as Mon&s;ieur <HI>Dan|cort</HI>
continu'd &s;till at <HI>Bre&s;t,</HI> the&s;e Gen|tlemen
and I diverted our &s;elves a little
with Hunting, believing we might as ea|&s;ily
go a-&s;hore again as we came aboard:
the Director's Cook who came aboard a|bout
&s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s, made u&s;e of a little
Skiff which was row'd by two Lads,
which we us'd to go a-&s;hore in; and
were now got 2 Leagues on the Sea near
<HI>Cameret,</HI> without minding which way
he &s;hould get back: we were &s;o earne&s;t
taking the Diver&s;ion of Hunting, that
we did not care where we put a-&s;hore,
without minding the Danger we ran,
in pa&s;&s;ing over craggy Rocks hanging
over the Sea, into which I had like to
fall two or three times. And after all
this pains, we had the Di&s;appointment to
meet with no Game; we were forc'd
to employ our &s;elves in killing Larks,
which prov'd afterwards more of u&s;e to
us then we imagin'd then: tir'd therefore
with this &s;ort of Hunting, we pa&s;t to a
better Entertainment, and fell to a Hare-Pa&s;ty,
which we brought with us, and a
Gla&s;s of good Wine.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="110">
After we had &s;pent our Provi&s;ions, we
return'd to our little Boat, and were no
&s;ooner at Sea again, than a &s;udden Storm
aro&s;e, in which I thought we &s;hould
have peri&s;h'd every moment. One of
our Gentlemen who was very much fa|tigu'd,
had fall'n a&s;leep as &s;oon as ever
he came into the Skiff, and was wa|ken'd
by our Noi&s;e, and the to&s;&s;ing of
the Boat; and when we were half way,
tho' he was &s;carce throughly awake, he
was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the Danger we were in,
that he cry'd out, We were certainly
lo&s;t if we did not return again.</P>
<P>Our little Rowers were almo&s;t &s;pent,
but not their Courage, who pretended
to chear us, &s;aying, There was no Dan|ger
of the Boat, tho' &s;he rowl'd &s;o; and
if the wor&s;t came to the wor&s;t, 'twas on|ly
&s;wimming for't: but they were mi|&s;taken
as to me; and be&s;ides, the Waves
were &s;o great and violent, that in&s;tead
of landing us, they had da&s;h'd us in pie|ces
again&s;t the Rocks.</P>
<P>We follow'd the Coun&s;el of our Com|panion,
and turn'd back again, rowing
with all our Might; and at la&s;t, with
much ado, got a-&s;hore, where we wait|ed
for calmer Weather.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="110">
In the mean time, while we were en|joying
our Safety a-&s;hore, we heard a
&s;ingle Gun, and &s;aw at the &s;ame time
the Top-Sails loo&s;e, which is the u&s;u|al
Signal of Sailing: There were &s;eve|ral
Lighters near us, which might have
carry'd us aboard; but we could not
prevail with any of the Ma&s;ters to whom
they belong'd, to give us a Ca&s;t.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;aw our Ship under Sail, the
Admiral &s;aluted with &s;even Guns, ma|king
the be&s;t of her way, running be|fore
the Wind, with all the Sail &s;he could
make; and I was not a little troubled
to be left behind thus, and all my Things
aboard.</P>
<P>We follow'd the &s;ight of our Ve&s;&s;el,
haling her as loud as ever we could baul,
and di&s;charging our Fu&s;eels, but all in
vain, the Ve&s;&s;el di&s;appear'd; one of our
Companions, who was but an ill Foot|man,
took <HI>Cameret</HI> Road, believing
he &s;hould find us there; and being in
&s;earch of him, we &s;pent a good part
of the Night in looking after one ano|ther.</P>
<P>Many Misfortunes attended us on our
way; for ever and anon, one was bogg'd
in the Mar&s;hes, another would fall into
<PB N="8" REF="111">
a Ditch, each calling on the other for
help, and all cur&s;ing the Cha&s;e: Hun|ger
follow'd our other Mi&s;eries, when
at la&s;t we got into an Inn, where every
thing was proportionable to our &s;hort
Pur&s;es; wretched Provi&s;ion and Beds:
however, all that we had was &s;pent that
Night, and we were forc'd to depart
Fa&s;ting next Morning.</P>
<P>As we went again in &s;earch of our
&s;tray'd Companion, and coa&s;ting by the
Sea, we perceiv'd Ma&s;ts, which at fir&s;t
we took for high Trees which grew by
the Sea, not &s;o much as flattering our
&s;elves that we &s;hould ever &s;ee our Ship
again, which we thought had been far
enough off; but coming near, we found
we had not lo&s;t our Pa&s;&s;age, for &s;he An|chor'd
in <HI>Camaret</HI> Road, three Leagues
from <HI>Bre&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Great was our Joy, and we had now
no more to do but to find out our Com|panion,
and go aboard: we endeavour'd
by Signals to give notice of us to the
Ship, but with no better Succe&s;s than
the Day before; &s;o that the Sloap did
not come to fetch us.</P>
<P>As we &s;ought all imaginable ways to
get out of our Troubles, we ob&s;erv'd a
<PB N="9" REF="111">
Bark at Sea plying towards the Ship; I
don't know how we came to fancy that
he whom we &s;ought might be in it; but
we fancy'd right, and he was the fir&s;t
Man we perceiv'd from the Shore; &s;o we
made Signs to 'em at a di&s;tance, which
he under&s;tood, and the Bark made to|wards
us: but it being impo&s;&s;ible to
come near, by rea&s;on of the Rocks,
'twas our Bu&s;ine&s;s to get aboard as well
as we could.</P>
<P>At la&s;t we did; and after a great deal
of Rejoycing at our Meeting &s;o happily
again, we thought of nothing but taking
our Re&s;t: but this was not the time;
for the Sea was &s;o rough, that the Waves
went over the Ship, and we were wet
from Head to Foot. This, joyn'd with
the exce&s;&s;ive Cold, and the Danger we
were in of being ca&s;t-away, which the
Seamen them&s;elves fear'd not a little,
ca&s;t us into a fre&s;h Concern, till after
much Difficulty and Hazard we got
aboard.</P>
<P>At our lei&s;ure we revolv'd all our pa&s;t
dangers, and pre&s;ently fell to eating
after hard Fa&s;ts; we remain'd &s;ome
time in the Road, waiting for Mon&s;ieur

&s;he was mounted with 80 Guns, and came

Succe&s;&s;ion to a little poor Sovereignty;
they were Brother and Son to the late
<PB N="100" REF="164">
Prince, and bottom'd their Preten&s;ions
on divers Rea&s;ons, too tedious, and too
incon&s;iderable to be mention'd here.
They propos'd to end their Difference
by force, or the King's deci&s;ion; the
King having forbid the fir&s;t, they
were forc'd to &s;tand to his Judg|ment.</P>
<P>On the Day appointed for giving
Judgment in their Difference, the two
Parties met in the great Place before
the Court, accompanied with great
Numbers, that &s;eem'd to form two Bat|talions,
about thirty Yards di&s;tant from
one another; they were arm'd with
Darts, Bows, Zagages, Javelins, and Mo|ri&s;co
Knives; the King follow'd by &s;ix
hundred Men, accoutred with their <HI>Gris-Gris</HI>'s,
appear'd mounted on a fine <HI>Bar|bary</HI>
Hor&s;e, and &s;o plac'd him&s;elf be|twixt
the two Rivals.</P>

yet they made u&s;e of Interpre|ters,
who told the King again what
they heard. The Son of the deceas'd
ended his Di&s;cour&s;e, in remon&s;trating
to him, That &s;eeing it had plea&s;ed GOD
to be&s;tow the Sovereignty in di&s;pute
on his Father, the Right of it now be|long'd

to him, which he hop'd his Ma|je&s;ty
would confirm to him. The King

has given it you, and I give it you a|gain

<P>Such an An&s;wer pre&s;ently di&s;pers'd
the Party of the Uncle, who retir'd
all alone. The <HI>Guiriot</HI>'s with their In|&s;truments
