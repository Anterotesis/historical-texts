<P>_WHere as in the yere of our Lorde God 1562. it plea&s;ed God to moue your honour, to choo&s;e and appoynt vs, to di&s;|couer and vewe a cer|taine longe coa&s;t of the We&s;t India, from the head of the land called Laflo|rida, drawyng toward the N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="4 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters">t, vnto the head of Brittons, di&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters">m the &s;ayd head of Laflorida 900. leagues, or there aboute: to the ende we might certifie you and make true report of the temperature, fertilitie, Ports, Hauens, Ryuers, and generally of all the com|modities that be &s;&eacute;en and found in that land, and al&s;o to learne what people were there dwelling, which thing you haue lo~g time ago de&s;ired, being &s;tirred therevnto by this zeale. That Fraunce might one day through new di&s;coueries
<PB REF="3"> haue knowledge of &s;traunge countryes and al&s;o thereof to receyue (by meanes of continuall trafique) riche &amp; ine&s;tima|ble commodities, as other nacions haue done by taking in hand &s;uch far nauiga|tions, bothe to the honour &amp; prowe&s;&s;e of their kinges &amp; princes, &amp; al&s;o to the en|crea&s;e of great profit &amp; v&s;e to their com|mon wealthes, countreys &amp; dominions, which is mo&s;t of all without co~pari&s;on to be con&s;idered &amp; e&s;temed. It &s;eemeth wel that ye haue bene &s;tirred herevnto euen of god aboue, &amp; led to it by the hope and de&s;iere you haue that a number of bruti&s;he people &amp; ignoraunt of Ie&s;us Chri&s;t, may by his grace come to &s;ome knowledge of his holy lawes &amp; ordinan|ces. So therefore it &s;eemeth that it hath plea&s;ed God by his godly prouidence to re&s;erue the care which he hath had of their &s;aluation vntill this tyme, and wil bryng them to our faith, at the time by him&s;elf alone for&s;&eacute;en &amp; ordeyned. For if it were n&eacute;edfull to &s;hew how many fro~ tyme to tyme haue gone about to finde
<PB REF="3"> out this great lande, &amp; to inhabit there: who neuerthele&s;&s;e haue alwayes failed and bene put by from their entention &amp; purpo&s;e: &s;ome by fear of &s;hipwracks, and &s;ome by great windes &amp; tempe&s;ts that droue them backe to their merueylous griefe. Of the which there was one a ve+ry famous &s;traunger named Seba&s;tian Cobote an excellent Pylot &s;ent thither by king Henry, the yere 1498. &amp; many others, who neuer could attaine to any habitation nor take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion there of one only fote of grou~d, nor yet approche or enter into the&s;e parties &amp; faire riuers into the which God hath brought vs. Wherefore, my lord, it may be wel &s;ayd that the liuing God hath re&s;erued this greate lande for your poore &s;eruauntes and &s;ubiectes as well to the ende they might be made great ouer thys poore people, and rude nation: as al&s;o to approue the former affection whyche our Kynges haue hadde vnto thys di&s;|couerie.</P>

<P>For the late king Fraunces the fir&s;t (of happye memorie) a prince endued with excellent vertues. The yere 1524. &s;ent a famous &amp; notable man a Florentine, named Me&s;&s;ire Iehan de Varran, to &s;erch &amp; di&s;couer the We&s;t parts as far as might be: Who departing fro~ D&eacute;epe with two ve&s;&s;elles litle differing from the making &amp; burden of the&s;e two Pin|naces of the kinges, which your honour hath ordeyned for this pre&s;ent nauiga|tion. In the which land they haue found the eleuation the Pole, an viij. degr&eacute;es. The countrey (as he writeth) goodly, fruitfull, &amp; &s;o good temperature, that it is not po&s;&s;ible to haue the better: being then as yet of no man &s;&eacute;ene, nor di&s;cer|ned. But they being not able to bryng to pa&s;&s;e at this fir&s;t voyage that whiche he had entended, nor to arriue in anye Port, by rea&s;on of &s;ondry inconuenien|ces, which commonly happen, were con+&s;trained to return into Fraunce: where after his arriuall, he neuer cea&s;&s;ed to make &s;uite vntill he was &s;ent thither
<PB REF="4"> again, where at la&s;t he died. The which occa&s;ion gaue &s;mall corage to &s;end thi|ther againe, &amp; was the cau&s;e that this laudable enterpri&s;e was left of, vntyll the yere 1534. at which time his Maie|&s;ty (de&s;iring always to enlarge his king+dome, countreys &amp; dominions, &amp; thad|uauncing &amp; ca&s;e of his &s;ubiects) &s;ent thi|ther a Pilot of S. Mallowes, a Briton, named Iames Cartiere, wel &s;&eacute;en in the art &amp; knowledge of nauigation, &amp; e&s;pe|cially of the North parts, commonly cal+led the new lande, led by &s;ome hope to finde pa&s;&s;age that wayes to the South &s;eas: Who being not able at his fir&s;t go+yng to bring any thing to pa&s;&s;e, that he pretended to do: was &s;ent thither again the yere folowing, &amp; likewi&s;e le &s;yre Hemerall, and as it is wel knowen thei did inhabite &amp; bylde, &amp; plant the kinges armes in the North part a good way in the land, as far as Tauadu &amp; Ochi&s;aon Wherefore my Lord tru&s;t iu&s;tly that a thing &s;o commendable &amp; worthy to be with good corage attempted that God
<PB REF="5"> woulde guyde &amp; k&eacute;epe vs, de&s;iring al|wayes to fulfil your commaundement. When we had done your bu&s;ines, and made our preparations the .xviij. day of February 1562, through the fauour of God we departed with our two ve&s;&s;els out of the hauen of Claue de Grace in|to the road Caur: and the next day hoy|&s;ted vp &s;ayle (the wynde beyng in the Ea&s;t) whiche la&s;ted &s;o fyue dayes, that we coulde not arriue at the nauch that is from betwene the coa&s;t of Brit|ton and Englande and the Iles of Surlinos and Wi&s;kam: So that the Wynde blowyng wyth great furye &amp; tempe&s;t out of the We&s;t, and We&s;t Southwe&s;t, altogether contrarye to our waye and cour&s;e, &amp; all that we coulde doe was to none effecte, be&s;ydes the great daunger of breakynge of our Ma&s;tes, as al&s;o to be hyndered in our other labours. Wherefore as well to &s;honne manye other inconueniences, whiche myght folowe to the preiudice &amp; breache of our viage, hauynge regard
<PB REF="5"> al&s;o to the lykely daunger of death, that &s;ome of our gentlemen &amp; &s;ouldiours be|ing troubled with feuers &amp; whot &s;icken+ne&s;&s;es, might haue fallen into: as al&s;o for other con&s;iderations, we thoughte good to fal into the road of Bre&s;t in Bri+tain, to &s;et there our &s;ick folke on land, &amp; &s;uffer the tempe&s;t to pa&s;&s;e. Fro~ whence (after we had taried there two dayes) we retourned againe to &s;eaward to fo|low our nauigation, &s;o that (my Lorde) albeit the wynde was for a long &s;ea&s;on very much agayn&s;t vs, &amp; trouble&s;ome: yet at the end (God geuyng vs through his grace &amp; accu&s;tomed goodnes a m&eacute;e|tely fauourable wynde) I determined with al diligence to proue a new cour&s;e which hath not ben yet attempted: tra|uer&s;ing y^e &s;eas of Octian 1800 leagues at the lea&s;t, whyche in d&eacute;ede is the true and &s;horte cour&s;e that hereafter mu&s;te be kepte, to the honour of our nacion, reiectynge the olde con&s;erued opinion, whyche to longe tyme hathe bene hol|den as trewe.</P>
<PB REF="6">
<P>Which is, that it was thought a thing impo&s;&s;ible to haue the wynde at Ea&s;t, Northe&s;t, &amp; k&eacute;epe the race &amp; cour&s;e we enterpri&s;ed, but that we &s;hould be dri|uen toward the region of Affrica, the Iles of Canaria, Madera, &amp; other lands thereabouts. And the cau&s;e why we haue bene the more prouoked &amp; a&s;&s;ured to take this newe race, hath bene be|cau&s;e that it &s;&eacute;emed to euerye one that we might not pa&s;&s;e nor go in this naui|gation without the &s;ight &amp; touching of the Antillies &amp; Lucaries, &amp; there &s;o|iourne &amp; take fre&s;he waters &amp; other ne|ce&s;&s;aries, as the Spaniards do in theyr voyage to new Spaine: whereof (than|ked be God) we haue had no n&eacute;ed, nor entered the chanell of Roham: whiche hath ben thought impo&s;&s;ible. For&s;eing al&s;o that it was not expedient for vs to pa&s;&s;e through the Ilands, as wel to &s;hon many inconueniences that might hap|pen in pa&s;&s;ing that waye (whereof &s;prin+geth nothing but innumerable quarels pleadings, confu&s;ions, &amp; breache of all

<PB REF="7"> neuer able to &s;ay or wryte to the full, as vnder the a&s;&s;ured hope that we haue al|wayes had in executing vprightlye that which I had receyued in charge of you, God would ble&s;&s;e our wayes &amp; nauiga|tions. After we had con&s;tantly &amp; wyth diligence in tyme conuenient determi|ned vppon the waye, we &s;houlde haue thought it noy&s;ome &amp; tedious to all our company, if it had before bene knowen vnto any without tourninge or waue|ring to or fro from their fir&s;t entention. And not with&s;tanding that Sathan did often what he coulde to &s;owe many ob|&s;tractes troubles &amp; lettes, accordyng to his accu&s;tomed &s;ubtelties, &s;o it is come to pa&s;&s;e, that God by his only goodnes hath geuen vs grace, to make the fur|the&s;t arte &amp; trauars of the &s;eas, that euer was made in oure memorie or knowledge, in longitude from the Ea&s;t to the We&s;t: and therefore was it com|monly &s;ayd both in Fraunce &amp; Spaine, &amp; al&s;o among vs, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for vs &s;afely to arriue thither, whither
<PB REF="7"> the Lorde dyd conducte vs. All whiche per&s;uaded but of ignoraunce &amp; lacke of attempting: whiche we haue not bene afrayde to geue aduenture to proue. Albeit that all Mariners Cardes do &s;et the Coa&s;ts with &s;hipwracks wyth|out Ports or Ryuers: whiche we haue founde otherwy&s;e as it foloweth.</P>
<P>Thur&s;daye the la&s;te of Apryll at the breake of the daye, we di&s;couered and clearely perceyued a faire coa&s;t, &s;tret|chynge of a great length couered with an infinite number of high &amp; fayre tr&eacute;es, we being not pa&s;t 7 or 8 leagues fro~ the &s;hore, the cou~trey &s;&eacute;eming vnto vs plain without any &s;hewe of hilles, &amp; appro|ching nearer within foure or fyue lea|gues of the lande, we ca&s;t an Anker at tenne fadome water, the bottome of the Sea beynge playne wyth muche Ocias and fa&s;te holde on the Southe &s;yde, as farre as a certayne poynte or Cape &s;ituate vnder that Latitude of nine &amp; twenty degr&eacute;es &amp; a half, which we haue named Cape Francois.</P>
<PB REF="8" MS="y">
<P>We coulde e&s;pye neyther Ryuer nor Bay, wherefore we &s;ent our Botes fur+ni&s;hed wyth men of experience, to &s;ou~d and knowe the coa&s;t nere the &s;hore: who retournyng to vs about one of the clock at after noone, declared that they had founde among other things .viij. fadom of water at the hard bancke of the &s;ea. Wherevpon hauing diligently wayed vp our Ankers, &amp; hoy&s;ted vp our &s;ayles with wynde at wyll we &s;ayled &amp; vewed the coa&s;t all alonge with vn&s;peakable plea&s;ure, of the odorours &s;mel &amp; beautie of the &s;ame. And becau&s;e there appea|red vnto vs no &s;ygne of any Port, about the &s;ettyng of the Sunne we ca&s;t anker agayne: which done, we did beholde to and fro the goodly order of the Woods wherwith God hath decked euery way the &s;ayde lande. Then perceyuyng to|ward the North a leaping &amp; a breaking of the water, as a &s;treame falling out of the land into the &s;ea. For the which we &s;et vp &s;ayles agayne to double the &s;ame whyle it was yet day. And as we had &s;o
<PB REF="8" MS="y"> done, &amp; pa&s;&s;ed beyond it: there appeared vnto vs a fayre entrye of a fayre Riuer which cau&s;ed vs to ca&s;t Anker agayne there nearer the lande: to the ende the next day we might &s;&eacute;e what it was, and though that the wynde blew for a tyme vehemently to the &s;horeward: yet the holde &amp; ankerage was &s;o good, that one cable &amp; one anker held vs fa&s;t, with out daunger or &s;lydyng.</P>
<P>The next day in the morning, beyng the fir&s;t of May, we a&s;&s;ayed to enter this Port, with two new Barges &amp; a Boate well trymmed, fyndyng lytle water Barges whiche might haue a&s;tonied &amp; cau&s;ed vs retourne backe to &s;hipborde, if God had not &s;peedely brought vs in. Where fyndyng .536. fadome water, en+tered into a goodly and great Ryuer, which as we went founde to encrea&s;e &s;tyll in depth and largenes, boyling and roryng through the multitude of all kynde of fy&s;he. This being entered we perceyued a great number of the In|dians inhabitantes there, commynge

Forthwith one of appearaunce, out of the be&s;t among them, brother vnto one of theyr Kynges, or gouernours, com|maunded one of the Indians to enter into the water: and to approche our boates to &s;hewe vs the coa&s;tes landing place. We &s;eing this (without any more douting or difficultie) landed, &amp; the me&s;|&s;enger (after we had rewarded him with &s;ome lookyng gla&s;&s;e, &amp; other pretie things of &s;male value) ranne inconti|nently towarde his Lorde: Who forth with &s;ent me hys Gyrdle, in token of a&s;&s;uraunce &amp; frend&s;hip, which Gyrdle was made of red leather, as well coue|red &amp; coloured as was po&s;&s;ible: and as I began to go towards him, he &s;et forth &amp; came &amp; receyued me gentlye, &amp; rey&s;ed after his maner all his men, folowyng
<PB REF="9"> with great &s;ilence &amp; mode&s;tie: yea more then our men did. And after we had a whyle with gentle v&s;age congratula|ted with him: we fell to the grounde a lytle waye from them, to call vpon the name of God, &amp; to be&s;eche hym to con|tinue &s;till hys goodnes towards vs, &amp; bring to the knowledge of our Sauiour Chri&s;t this poore people. Whyle we were thus praying (they &s;itting vppon the ground, which was &s;trawed &amp; dre&s;|&s;ed with Baye bowes) behelde &amp; harke|ned vnto vs, very attentiuelye without either &s;peaking or mouing: &amp; as I made a &s;igne vnto their king, lifting vp myne arme, &amp; &s;tretching forth one finger, only to make them looke vp to heauenward. He lykewy&s;e liftinge vp his arme to|wardes heauen put forth two fingers: whereby it &s;&eacute;emed that he made vs to vnder&s;tande, that they wor&s;hipped the Sunne &amp; the Moone for Gods: as after|wards we vnder&s;tood it &s;o. In the mean time their numbers increa&s;ed, &amp; thither came the Kynges brother, that was

For it is their maner to talke &amp; bargaine &s;itting: &amp; the chiefe of them to be aparte, from the meaner &s;orte, with a &s;hewe of great obedience to theyr Kynges, Superiours, &amp; El|ders. They be all naked, &amp; of a goodlye &s;tature, myghtye, fayre, &amp; as well &s;ha|pen &amp; proporcioned of bodye, as anye people in the worlde: verye gentle, cur|tey&s;e, and of a good nature.</P>
<P>The mo&s;te parte of them couer theyr Raynes &amp; priuities with fayre Hartes &s;kynnes, paynted mo&s;te commonlye with &s;undrye colours: &amp; the fore parte of theyr bodye &amp; armes, be paynted wyth pretye deui&s;ed workes, of Azure, red, &amp; blacke, &s;o well &amp; &s;o properly as the be&s;t Painter of Europe coulde not a|mende it.

<P>But de&s;yring to imploye the re&s;t of the daye on the other &s;yde of this Riuer, to view &amp; knowe tho&s;e Indians that we &s;awe there.

<P>Soone after this came thither the king with his brethren &amp; others with bowes &amp; arrowes in their hands, v&s;ing there|withall a goodly &amp; a graue fa&s;hion, with their behauiour right &s;ouldierlyke, &amp; as warlyke boldnes as may be.

<P>The night nowe approchynge, we were fayne to retourne to our &s;hyppe, very muche to our griefe: for that we dur&s;te not hazarde to enter wyth our &s;hyppe, by rea&s;on of a Barre of Sande, that was at the enterye of the Porte, howe be it, at a full Sea there is two fadome &amp; a halfe of water at the lea&s;te, and it is but a leape ouer a &s;urge to pa&s;&s;e this Barre, not pa&s;&s;ynge the length of two Cables.

Beynge entered into them about thr&eacute;e leagues, we fou~de in a place very commodious, &s;tronge, &amp; plea&s;ant of &s;ituation, certaine Indians, who receyued vs very gently: Howe be it, we being &s;omewhat neare their hou|&s;es, it &s;eemed it was &s;omewhat again&s;t their good wylles that we went thi|ther, for at theyr cryes and noy&s;es they made theyr wyues and chyldren and hou&s;holde &s;tuffe to be caryed into

And it &s;&eacute;emeth y^e men maye &s;ayle without daunger through all the countrey, &amp; neuer enter into the great &s;ea, which were a wonderfull aduan|tage.

It is &s;et vnder &s;o good a climate, that none of our men (though we were there in the hote&s;t tyme of the yere, the Sunne entring in|to Cancer) were troubled with any &s;ic|kene&s;&s;es.

<P>The channell &amp; depth of this Riuer of Seyne, is on the &s;ide of the medow that is in the Ile of May.

And as we had &s;ay|led about &s;ixe or &s;euen leagues, there ap+peared vnto vs another Bay, where we ca&s;t anker, &amp; tarying &s;o all the night, in the morning we went thither, &amp; finding (by our &s;ounding) at the entrie manye bancks &amp; beatings, we dur&s;t not enter there w^t our great &s;hip, hauing named y^e riuer Somme, which is 8. 9. 10. 11. fadom depth, deuiding it &s;elf into many great Ilandes, &amp; &s;mall goodly medow grou~ds &amp; pa&s;tures, &amp; euery where &s;uch abun|daunce of fi&s;he as is incredible, &amp; on the We&s;t Northwe&s;t &s;ide, there is a great Ryuer that commeth from the cou~trey of a great length ouer: &amp; another on the Northea&s;t &s;ide, which retourne into the &s;ea.

And be&s;ides this we di&s;couered &amp; found al&s;o 7. riuers more, as great &amp; as good, cutting &amp; deuiding the land into fayre &amp; great Ilands. The India~s inhabitants there be like in maners, &amp; the countrey in fertillitie apt &amp; commodious through out to beare &amp; bring forth plentifully all that men woulde plant or &s;owe vpon it.

And to be &s;hort there lacketh nothing. Wherfore being not able to enter &amp; lye wyth our great ve&s;&s;els there, we coulde make no long abiding, nor enter &s;o farre into the ryuers &amp; countreys as we would fayne haue done: for it is well knowen howe many inconueniences haue happened vnto men, not only in attempting of newe di&s;coueries, but al&s;o in all places

<P>Vppon Whit&s;onday the xxvij. day of May, after we had perceyued &amp; con&s;ide|red that there was no remedye, but ts a&s;&s;ay to finde the meanes to harber our &s;hips, as wel to amend &amp; trimme them, as to get vs fre&s;h water, Wood, &amp; other nece&s;&s;aries, whereof we hauynge opi|nion that there was no fayrer or fytter place for the purpo&s;e, then port Royall. And when we had &s;ounded the entrye and the Channell (thancked be God)

<P>In thys parte there are manye Ry|uers of meane bygne&s;&s;e and large, where wythoute daunger the greate&s;t &s;hyppes of the worlde myght bee har|bered, whyche we founde, no Indian inhabityng thereaboutes.

<PB REF="21"> as good &amp; likely co~modities be found as in other places thereby. For we founde there a great number of Pepertrees, the Pepper yet gr&eacute;ene, &amp; not ready to be gathered: Al&s;o the be&s;t water of the worlde, &amp; &s;o many &s;orts of fi&s;hes that ye may take them without net or angle &s;o many as ye wyll. Al&s;o an innumerable &s;orte of wylde foule of all &s;orts, &amp; in li|tle Ilandes at the entrye of this hauen, on the Ea&s;t Northe&s;t &s;yde, there is &s;o great number of Egreps that the bu&s;|&s;hes be all whyte &amp; couered with them, &s;o that one may take of the yonge ones with his hand as many as he wyll carye away. There be al&s;o a number of other foules, as Hernes, Bitters, Cuxlues. And to be &s;hort, there is &s;o many &s;mall byrdes that it is a &s;traunge thyng to be &s;eene. We founde the Indians there more doubtful &amp; fearfull then the others before. Yet after we had bene in theyr hou&s;es, &amp; congregated with them, and &s;hewed curte&s;ey to tho&s;e that we found to haue abandoned there through boats
<PB REF="21"> meale, victuall, and &s;mall hou&s;holde &s;tuffe, &amp; both in, not takyng awaye or touchyng any part thereof, and in lea|uing in y^e place where they dre&s;&s;ed theyr meate, Knyues, Loking gla&s;&s;es, litle Beades of gla&s;&s;e, which they loue and e&s;teme aboue Golde &amp; Pearles, for to hange them at their eares &amp; necke, and to geue them to their wyues &amp; children; they were &s;omewhat emboldened.</P>
<P>For &s;ome of them came to our Boates, of the which we caried two goodly and &s;trong abourde our &s;hyppes, clothyng and v&s;ing them as gently as it was po&s;|&s;ible. But they &s;ea&s;ed not day nor night to lament, &amp; at length they e&s;caped a|way. Wherefore albeit, I was willing (according to your commaundement &amp; memoriall) to bringe awaye &s;ome of them with vs, on the Princes behalfe &amp; yours, I forbare to do &s;o for many con&s;i+derations &amp; rea&s;ons that they told me, &amp; for that we were in dout that (leauing &s;ome of our men there to inhabite) all the countrey, men, women, &amp; children,
<PB REF="22" MS="y"> would not haue &s;ea&s;ed to pur&s;ue them for to haue theirs agayne: &s;eyng they be not able to con&s;ider &amp; waye to what en|tent we &s;hould haue caried them away: and this may be better done to their con+tentation, when they haue better ac|quaintaunce of vs, and know that there is no &s;uch crueltie in vs, as in other peo|ple and nacions, of whome they haue bene beguyled vnder colour of good faith: which doing in the ende tourned to the doers no good. This is the ryuer of Iordain in mine opinion, whereof &s;o much hath bene &s;poken, which is verye faire and the countrey good, both for the ea&s;ie habitation, &amp; al&s;o for many other things, which &s;huld be to long to write.</P>
<P>The .xx. of May we planted another columne or pillor grauen w^t the kings armes on the &s;outh &s;ide, in a high place, of thentry of a great riuer, which we cal+led Libourne: where there is a lake of fre&s;h water very good, &amp; on the &s;ame &s;ide a litle lower towards thentry of y^t haue~ is one of y^e faire&s;t fou~tains y^t a man may
