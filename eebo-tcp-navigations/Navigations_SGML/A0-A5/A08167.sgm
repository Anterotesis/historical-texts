<HEAD>The Copy of a Letter from Bru&s;&s;els, dated the 23 of <HI>Aug.</HI> concerning the Progre&s;&s;e and Re&s;olution of <HI>Count Mansfield,</HI> &s;ince his being in Lorraine. With his la&s;t Conflict and Victory with <HI>Gon&s;alo,</HI> the 19. of <HI>Aug.</HI> in Brabant.</HEAD>
<P>SIr, I know you cannot be ignorant of the various reports &s;pred abroad (throughout all the&s;e parts of Chri&s;tendome) of <HI>Count Mansfields</HI> being for the&s;e two monthes pa&s;t: Some affirming that hee is very weake; others, that he is very &s;trong: &s;ome, that hee &s;hould be entertained by the French King, and that he &s;hould be falne off from the Duke of <HI>Brun&s;wicke,</HI> vpon a breach betwixt them; and that there &s;hould be a mutiny in their Army, whereupon they &s;hould bee vtterly di&s;per&s;ed.</P>
<P><HI>Count Mansfield</HI> being pa&s;&s;ed through <HI>Loraine,</HI> (where he payed for what he tooke, and commanded his Souldiers to forbeare doing any wrong, or taking any thing from any of the Duke of <HI>Loraines</HI> Subiects; notwith&s;tanding, at a place or two his Souldiers of|fered &s;ome violence.) ariuing in <HI>Champaigne,</HI> made his Randeuow vpon the Frontier thereof, almo&s;t for this two monthes. In the meane time the French King made great preparation, as fearing le&s;t he &s;hould in|uade
<PB N="6" REF="6"> his Countrey: but vpon triall he found him to come not as an enemy, but as one who intended to doe him &s;eruice, and did thereupon giue command to Duke <HI>Deniuers</HI> to treate with the &s;aid C. <HI>Mansfield</HI> vpon certaine Articles or propo&s;itions, namely, on the Kings behalfe: <HI>Deniuers</HI> propounded vnto him both honors and profits, as that he would make him a Mar|&s;hall of France, and a Generall of certain forces which he would &s;end for the recouery of the <HI>Valtoline;</HI> that he would giue him 200000. Crownes in hand, and 20000. Crownes <HI>per annum. Mansfield</HI> on the other &s;ide was to bring to the Kings &s;eruice of his Army 6000. foot, and 2000. Hor&s;e, which &s;hould pre&s;ently receiue pay of his Maie&s;ty. But <HI>Mansfield</HI> hauing a farther reach (as by the &s;equell appeares) intends no|thing el&s;e by the &s;aid treaty, but to get him&s;elfe more aduantage, and to preuent &s;u&s;pition in the matters which he directly intended, namely, for the ioyning with the <HI>Hollanders:</HI> For being at a towne called <HI>Mo|&s;oon,</HI> on the Frontiers of France, hee gaue out of pur|po&s;e that <HI>Brun&s;wicke</HI> and he were fallen out, and that he was fallen from the &s;aid Duke of <HI>Brun&s;wicke:</HI> and had &s;ecured him&s;elfe in the &s;trong Towne of <HI>Mo&s;oon,</HI> and would ioyne with the French King; by which policy, the way to <HI>Brabant</HI> was the more &s;ecure, and his enemy <HI>Gon&s;alo</HI> made the le&s;&s;e ha&s;te after him: For this treaty of his with the French King, did &s;o amaze his enemies that they knew no other but that hee would haue concluded with him, on the contrary you &s;hall vnder&s;tand, about the 16 day of this month, in the night (hauing before &s;elected out 6000. of his be&s;t hor&s;e, whereof 2. thou&s;and are Carabins or light
<PB N="7" REF="6"> hor&s;e, and 3000. &s;peciall footmen: which &s;aid foote he likewi&s;e prouided hor&s;e for the mo&s;t part of them) marched away from <HI>Mo&s;oon</HI> vnexpected, towards <HI>Mouns</HI> in <HI>Henalt,</HI> where he ariued the 18 of this month near the Riuer of the <HI>Mozel</HI> with the D. of <HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> leauing behind 8000. foot, and 1000. hor&s;e, with all his Canon, and the mo&s;t part of their baggage to the command of the Duke of <HI>Bulloin,</HI> and tho&s;e of the religion.

<P>TO collect out of Stories the many and wonderfull iudgements of God from time to time &s;hewed and executed vpon the &s;onnes of men, is a labour be|yond my purpo&s;e at this time to vndertake, and there|fore I will onely relate vnto you a &s;tory of a late won|derfull and lamentable accident, which happened in <HI>Deuon&s;hire,</HI> and there in chiefly of a &s;hipwracke in <HI>Cat|water</HI> rode by <HI>Plimouth,</HI> on Sunday night and Mun|day morning the 18. and 19. of Augu&s;t la&s;t. There be|ing floting in the Rode of <HI>Catwater</HI> diuers &s;hips, &s;ome newly ariued, others bound out for &s;euerall places; among the re&s;t, two Merchants &s;hips hired by Moun|&s;eur <HI>Sabe&s;a</HI> to tran&s;port certaine men for Rochell, both which &s;hips being preparing, and partly proui|ded of their men, the one was ca&s;t away with other &s;hips and barkes riding in the &s;aid Rode afore&s;aid: The other onely buldge. But before this &s;torme aro&s;e, I will not omit to &s;et downe a &s;trange accident which happened in one of the &s;hips, there being in her both Mariners and Souldiers. About &s;ome three dayes before the &s;torme, one man in her &s;eeming to be fran|ticke
<PB N="11" REF="8"> or &s;icke of &s;ome violent di&s;ea&s;e, required leaue to goe a &s;hore, for his time was come and hee mu&s;t away. The Captaine notwith&s;tanding would not &s;uf|fer him; in&s;omuch that the fellow &s;aid, If they would not let him goe it would bee the wor&s;e for them all; for, &s;aid he, doe you not &s;ee two deuils yonder, and pointed with his finger; nay, &s;aid he, there will come three more anon. They notwith&s;tanding cau&s;ed him to be bound and put in the &s;tronge&s;t hold of the &s;hip, vnder hatches, the hatches being clo&s;e kept downe: but about the euening when they were at prayers, hee came vp and walked on the hatches a while, whereat they were much amazed, till on a &s;uddaine he leaped ouer board, and after him &s;eemed to leape a thing like a great ma&s;tiffe dog; whereupon did ari&s;e &s;uch a tem|pe&s;tuous &s;torme of wind, thunder, and lightning, that the &s;hip wherein this mi&s;erable wretch was, left her anckers, and was &s;plit on the Rockes, and all her men except about 8. were ca&s;t away; &s;ome of them being ca&s;t vp vpon the rockes, and a proper Gentleman a|mong&s;t the re&s;t, was for certaine dayes &s;tanding vp|right betwixt two rockes, as though he were aliue, and impo&s;&s;ible to be got out vnle&s;&s;e the rockes bee beaten away. In the &s;aid rode were likewi&s;e ca&s;t away &s;euen other Ships &amp; Barks, one wherof was driuen with the violence of the &s;torme, vpon the top of a hie rock, not much impaired, &s;o &s;trangely that it is thought a thing impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould come there, and is as impo&s;&s;ible to be gotten off againe without &s;poyling, beeing dri|uen &s;o farre from the water: In this &s;torme is repor|ted to bee lo&s;t out of the&s;e 8. &s;hips 300. men, be&s;ides the Ships and goods.

<PB N="12" REF="9"> places be&s;ides, were many &s;hips ca&s;t away, &s;o that it is thought the lo&s;&s;e by &s;hipwracke in the we&s;t parts of England is 40. or 50000. pounds.</P>
<P>Now concerning the hurt done by land, by thun|der and lightning the &s;ame time through <HI>Deuon&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Summer&s;et&s;hire;</HI> in many places whole fields of Corne bla&s;ted, &s;tackes of Corne bla&s;ted and &s;corched, nay the violence of the winde and thunder was &s;uch, that is &s;catttered and di&s;per&s;ed the Corne as if it had beene &s;owne againe, and as if God would not &s;uffer vs to reape the fruits of the earth, but would &s;catter it againe, nay out of the eares, as if the flayle had beene vpon it.
