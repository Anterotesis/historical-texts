<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>I</HI> Here pre&s;ent you with a Di&s;h of Dainties, I a&s;&s;ure you
you no <HI>Kick&s;haws,</HI> though dre&s;t after the French mode.
To de&s;cribe that people aright, a man mu&s;t have in him
extraordinary of the Mimmick, and therefore I would de&s;ire
the Reader in the peru&s;al of the&s;e Lines, to adde to them
&s;omething of action; for it is impo&s;sible to per&s;onate a
French-man aright, unle&s;s he with it play the Antick:
My reque&s;t therefore is to all tho&s;e who &s;hall read this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ook
in Taverns, Ale-hou&s;es, or Coffee-hou&s;es, to have a &s;pecial
care therein, that I may not be murthered in my own Lines,
but to adde to it a graceful &s;haking of the head, drawing back
the legs, and thru&s;ting out the &s;houlders, and then it will
be <HI>ala mode France.</HI> If all the humors I have writ of them
do not &s;uit patt to the Nation the &s;ame time you read this,
you mu&s;t impute it to the ficklene&s;s of tho&s;e people, who&s;e
incon&s;tancy is &s;uch, that let me now write never &s;o real a
truth of their Garb or Clothes, though the Author and
Printer make all the ha&s;te imaginable, they will be in another
fa&s;hion before the Book can be publi&s;hed, that a Taylor may
as well take mea&s;ure of a Garment for the Moon, as an Au|thor
to de&s;cribe the Habits and Fa&s;hions of that People. So
now Reader, having told you at the door how you are to be|have
your &s;elf, if you plea&s;e walk in and &s;ee the Show.</P>

<SPEAKER>Engli&s;h-man.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed a Fidler in <HI>France</HI> is a man of a very high repute, for I
remember about five years ago being in your Countrey at a town
<PB N="4" REF="3">
not far di&s;tant from <HI>Orleans,</HI> while&s;t I and the re&s;t of my compa|ny
(among&s;t which was a <HI>Fille de Joy</HI> of <HI>Paris</HI>) were at Dinner,
there entred into our Room three of the&s;e uncouth fellows, with
Flats on their heads like cover'd Di&s;hes, and in &s;uch a garb as our
Countrey-men u&s;e to clothe Poles wherewith to affrighten Crows
from eating their Corn, being for the mo&s;t part pinn'd together,
and the re&s;t fa&s;tened with here and there a &s;titch, &s;o that they
were <HI>a la mode de Tatterdemallion.</HI> At the fir&s;t &s;ight of them I
ca&s;t one eye on my Cloak, and the other on my Sword, as not
knowing what occa&s;ion I might have of the one, to de&s;end the
other; for by their in&s;ol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">nt int<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;ion and &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">cy boldne&s;s, I could
not imagine them to be other than Thieves: but when I took a
more &s;trict &s;urvey of their Apparrel, I &s;oon alter'd that opinion,
and rather gue&s;s'd them to be the Excrement of a Pri&s;on, though
it &s;oon appeared that I was alike deceived in my thoughts, they
being neither better nor wor&s;e than errant Fidlers. The&s;e fel|lows,
though &s;uch as we in <HI>England</HI> &s;hould not hold worthy of the
Whipping-po&s;t, without leave, and without reverence on their
parts performed, fell to their work, abu&s;ing our ears with &s;uch an
har&s;h Le&s;&s;on, that one of our School-boys playing on the <HI>Jews-Trump</HI>
compared to this, might have been taken for the Mu&s;ick
of the Spheres: but as if this had not been puni&s;hment enough un|to
us, they mu&s;t needs adde to it one of their Songs, but then
how did I ble&s;s my &s;elf in the remembrance of our Ballad-&s;ingers
when they Chant the Tunes of <HI>In Summer time,</HI> and <HI>Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">vy-Cha&s;e!</HI>
Now though I under&s;tood not French perfectly yet by that little
I had, and the &s;impering of the <HI>Fille de Joy,</HI> I perceived it was
Bawdy, yea, &s;uch as could not patiently be endured by any but a
French-man.</P>

<SPEAKER>Engli&s;h man.</SPEAKER>
<P>But <HI>Mon&s;ieur,</HI> give me leave to proceed in my Story: what to
do to be rid of the&s;e fellows I knew not, for I knew not how to
call them Rogues hand&s;omly in French, and for other Languages
<PB N="5" REF="3">
they under&s;tood none, and to beat them, they were Villains of
&s;uch an inferior quality, as indeed was not worthy of mine or any
hone&s;t mans anger; a knot of Ra&s;cals &s;o infinitely below the &s;e|verity
of a Statute, that they would have di&s;credited the Stocks;
and to have hang'd them, as it would have hazarded the reputa|tion
of the Gallowes, &s;o it would have been unprofitable to the
Executioner, their Clothes being onely fit for the Rag-woman;
it would have puzzled a man in a whole years time to have &s;tudi|ed
a Vengeance for them which they would not have injured, in
the &s;uffering the greate&s;t torment one could inflict on them, be|ing
not to hearken to their Ribaldry. But to proceed, after their
Song was ended, one of them pulled a Di&s;h out of his pocket,
and &s;et it before us, into which we were to ca&s;t our Benevolence,
which by cu&s;tom (you know <HI>Mon&s;ieur</HI>) is but but onely a Soll from
every man; &s;uch a rare Calling it is to be a Fidler in <HI>France!</HI></P>

which place being a greater &s;trength unto it, and more powerful

ours; the French men mo&s;t commonly carrying all their wealth
on their back, &s;o that when they are in their be&s;t Clothes, they
may be &s;aid to be in the middle of their E&s;tates, when the poore&s;t
Trade&s; man in <HI>London</HI> hath his Plate to drink in, and is &s;erved up
with his Pewter-di&s;hes of &s;everal &s;orts, your Arti&s;ans of <HI>Paris</HI>

<SPEAKER>Engli&s;h-man.</SPEAKER>
<P>The French Barber trims &s;o as makes a man look like a Mon|key,
come <HI>Mon&s;ieur</HI> I mu&s;t help you out with it: You French men
are indeed excellent fellows for Toys, very perfect at Tooth|picks,
Beard-bru&s;hes, and Gentle womens Fans; but in other more
&s;ub&s;tantial Trades how infinitely &s;hort do you come of the Eng|li&s;h?
Your Cutlers make &s;uch abominable and fearful Knives, as
would grieve a mans heart to &s;ee them, enough almo&s;t to make
one loathe the Victuals that &s;hould be cut by &s;uch mi&s;-&s;hapen In|&s;truments.
And your Glovers are wor&s;e than your Cutlers, for
you would imagine by their Gloves, that the hand for which they
were made, were cut off by the wri&s;t. And what excellent work|men
<PB N="7" REF="4">
your Painters are, may be &s;een by the Signes hanging over
each door in <HI>Paris</HI> for a di&s;tingui&s;hment, as with us at <HI>London:</HI> but
&s;o hideou&s;ly are the&s;e made, and &s;o little re&s;embling the thing &s;ig|nified,
that if a Hen did not &s;crape better Pourtraitures on a
Dunghil, I would be bound to eat no other meat but of a French
pai&s;ant womans dre&s;&s;ing during life, which would be a torment
next to &s;tarving; very convenient therefore is it that they have
it printed in Capital Letters under every Sign what it is, for fear
the Spectators &s;hould take a Cock for a Bull, or a Pigg for a
Go&s;s-hawk.</P>

<P>For your Countrey, I mu&s;t confe&s;s indeed the &s;oyl thereof is

what is that to the poor pea&s;ant, who onely beholdeth it with his
eyes, &s;eldom or never &s;o much as ta&s;ting it with his mouth; a
Capon or Rabbit being almo&s;t as unlawful for the&s;e mi&s;erable
Creatures to eat, as it was in the Old Law for any but the Prie&s;ts
to eat Shew-bread. I believe one of your Countrey Taylors has
but an ordinary Trade with them, they thinking them&s;elves hap|py
if in their apparel they can but mount to Canva&s;s, for wool|len
Cloth is beyond the reach of their pur&s;e, and he that a&s;pires
to Fu&s;tain, will not &s;tick to ju&s;tle for the be&s;t place in the Pari&s;h,
even to that of the Church-warden: For Hats they will be &s;ure
to have them, though their Bellies pinch for it, and that it may
appear they have them, they alwayes keep them on their heads.
I &s;uppo&s;e they are great Enemies to Ho&s;iers and Shooe-makers,
<PB N="8" REF="5">
becau&s;e they &s;eldom wear any Shooes or Stocking;, but &s;uch as
Nature furni&s;hes them withal, unle&s;s it be on &s;ome principal Ho|ly-day,

<P>What is &s;poken of your Nation in general, that they are won
with a Feather, and lo&s;t with a &s;traw, may more particularly be
applyed to the&s;e your <HI>de brave Gentil men,</HI> who at fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t &s;ight will
be as familiar with you as your &s;leep, and follow you as doth your
&s;hadow; but upon the lea&s;t di&s;ta&s;te, for a word &s;peaking they
will draw their &s;word: They are brave fellows at a fir&s;t On-&s;et,
begin an action like thunder, and end it in a &s;moke, at the fir&s;t
encounter more than men, in the clo&s;e thereof le&s;s than women.
They are very Complemental, and full of their Court Cringes,
without which none is accounted a Gentil-man. At my fir&s;t co|ming
to <HI>Paris,</HI> one of the&s;e Mon&s;ieurs add e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me,
carrying his head as if he had been ridden with a Martingal, then
did he draw back his legs, and thru&s;t out his &s;houlders in &s;uch a
ridiculous po&s;ture, that made my Wor&s;hip to laugh heartily to &s;ee

you into better manners you will take it kindly, ki&s;s your hand,
and cry <HI>Serviteur.</HI> I mu&s;t confe&s;s at fir&s;t when I came to <HI>Paris,</HI> I
did much admire the gallantry of your Nation, thinking no place
in the world comparable to it for Nobility and Gentry, until at
la&s;t one foul mi&s;take rectified my judgement, which was this:
There came to vi&s;it a Scotch Lord of my acquaintance a French
<PB N="9" REF="5">
Gallant, who had on him a Sute of Turky Grogram doubled
with Taffata, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">a&s;ht after the French fa&s;hion, and belayed with
Bugle-lace, a Shirt of pure Holland appearing through the open|ings
of his Doublet, which was likewi&s;e wrought with curious
Needle-work; the Points at his Wa&s;te and Knees (for &s;o the fa|&s;hion
there then was) alledged with a Silver-edging; his Garters,
Ro&s;es, and Hat-band &s;utable to his Points; a Beaver Hat, and a
pair of Silk-&s;tockings; his Cloak al&s;o of Turky Grogram cut up|on
black Taffaty. This man by his Habit I gue&s;&s;ed to be no le&s;s
than a Lord, (for who would have imagined <HI>Ae&s;ops</HI> Fable to have
been a real truth, that the A&s;s was dre&s;t up in the Lyons skin)
and according to the man that I imagined him to be, I gave him
the Stile of <HI>My Lord</HI> at every word. After &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e, he &s;ee|ing
me to clap a Handkerchief to my cheek, and to make a kinde
of a &s;owre face, asked me what I ailed? I told him I was very
much troubled with the Tooth-ache. Alas, &s;aid he, that is a grie|vous
pain, but ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">l on me at my Lodging the next morning, and I
&s;hall pre&s;ently give you ea&s;e: I humbly thanked his Lord&s;hip for
&s;uch an immen&s;e favor, with the greate&s;t obey&s;ance I could de|vi&s;e;
and the next morning &s;omewhat before the time appoint|ed,
&s;ent my &s;ervant for a Barber to trim me and make me neat,
becau&s;e I could not tell what occa&s;ion I might have of &s;eeing his
Lady, or his Daughters. This Me&s;&s;enger chanced to happen on
his Lord&s;hip, who was no other than a Barber; but when I &s;aw
him come in with his Apron before him, and pulling a Ca&s;e of In|&s;truments
out of his pocket, ble&s;s me! I thought I &s;hould have
&s;plit my &s;elf with laughing, had not the con&s;ideration of my own
folly, of being &s;o obey&s;ant to him the night before, &s;omething re|&s;trained
me. His Lord&s;hip, though he gue&s;&s;ed the cau&s;e of my
extraordinary mirth, yet fell to work about me, to the earning
of a <HI>Quarde&s;ou,</HI> and indeed he was very dexterous in his Art, and
&s;oon made my Chin <HI>ala mode;</HI> then would he have proceeded to
to the pulling out of my Tooth, but the pain being now &s;ome|thing
abated, I told his Lord&s;hip I would retain it in my head a
little longer: wherefore pocketing up his <HI>Quarde&s;ou,</HI> with a low
cringing, and le&s;s courte&s;ie on my part than before, his Lord&s;hip
departed.</P>

<P>A Friend and I having a great de&s;ire to &s;ee the Countrey, we

been mounted on a Po&s;t, as on &s;uch Jades; as lean they were as
<HI>Envy</HI> is by the Poets feigned to be, having neither fle&s;h on their
bones, nor skin on their fle&s;h, nor hair on their skin; neither was
it &s;o alone, that their bones might be numbred through their skin,
but the Spur-galls had made &s;uch Ca&s;ements in their fle&s;h, that an
ordinary Farrier might have known what Di&s;ea&s;es they were trou|bled

&s;urely <HI>Don Quixot</HI>'s <HI>Rozinante</HI> was a hor&s;e of State to
either of the&s;e. Being thus mounted, and galloping a foot pace,
in twelve hours we had ridden fourteen miles; night coming on,
and a pretty big Town ju&s;t before us, we re&s;olved to lodge there,
whert enquiring for one of the chief Inns, we were directed to
the skelliton of a Hou&s;e, which in <HI>England</HI> would &s;carcely have
pa&s;&s;ed for an Ale-hou&s;e, and yet there it was an Inn, ay, and an
honorable one too: Alighting at the door, the Hoa&s;t of the hou&s;e
came out unto us, at fir&s;t &s;ight I took him to be one of the three
Fidlers I told you of before, a pitiful ragged, &s;habby fellow.</P>

Ale-hou&s;es are a &s;tory higher prai&s;e worthy than your Inns,
as may appear by the de&s;cription of this, and by which you may
give a gue&s;s at the re&s;t. No &s;ooner were we alighted, but our
Hoa&s;t (the ragged fellow I told you of before) conducted us to a
<PB N="11" REF="6">
room, &s;omewhat re&s;embling a Charnel-hou&s;e, being full as dark
and as dampi&s;h; on one &s;ide whereof was a pretty big hole, which
formerly had been a Gla&s;s-window, but the Gla&s;s being gone it
was for the mo&s;t part &s;topped up with Pea&s;e &s;traw: In this room
was the re&s;emblance of three Beds, for by their de&s;cription you
will &s;ay it was improper to call them Beds; the foundation of
them was of &s;traw, which not having been &s;hifted in many a year,
it was &s;o infinitely thronged together, that the Wooll-packs which
our Judge &s;it on in the Parliament, were melted Butter to them.
Upon this lay a large Bag containing a Medley of Flocks and Fea|thers,
but &s;o ill ordered, that they &s;tuck out of the &s;ides like to the
knobs of a Crab-tree Cudgel; the Sheets on tho&s;e Beds were
<HI>party per pale,</HI> a mean betwixt white and black, and &s;o cour&s;e, that
a Mariner would have di&s;dained to have u&s;ed them for a Sayl; the
Coverlets were alike an&s;werable to the re&s;t of the Bedding, here
a hole, and there a patch, and for Curtains and Valances, my
Landlady had di&s;robed the Beds of them two years before, to make

Meat being on the Board, we fell unto it, hunger making us the
better able to dige&s;t the Na&s;tine&s;s of the Cookery: After Sup|per,
de&s;irous to go to Bed to refre&s;h our Bodies, weary with ri|ding
on tho&s;e tyred Jades, we called for a <HI>Chamberlain,</HI> but you
might a good have &s;poken Greek to them, none of them under|&s;tanding
what a Chamberlain was: at la&s;t came a fellow with &s;ome
patches hanging on him, but for the mo&s;t part open to the skin,
who having pulled off our Boats, pre&s;ently had recour&s;e to the
Coverlet to wipe them, and having rubb'd one &s;ide a little, left the
other part to be fini&s;hed by us if we would have it; it was enough
for him that he had written the Copy. Thus forced to make a
Law of Nece&s;&s;ity, we lay till morning, not making extraordinary
ha&s;te out, le&s;t perchance we might have lo&s;t the &s;ight of my Hoa|&s;te&s;s

<P>Well then, to proceed: Being mounted, and riding very &s;oftly

had forced to walk with a &s;taff in the &s;treet, here taught their feet

<P>That which to you is &s;o plea&s;ing, &s;oon wearied us, wherefore

about Noon came to another Town &s;omewhat bigger than a Vil|lage,
and comparable to the wor&s;er &s;ort of Market-Towns in
<HI>England,</HI> di&s;tant from the place where we lay before, about five
miles, (for we rid very hard, and &s;pared not for Hor&s;e-fle&s;h) here
we re&s;olved to bait both our &s;elves and our hor&s;es, and to that
purpo&s;e &s;ingled out an Inn where we expected to finde be&s;t ac|commodations,
and indeed we thought we had found a great pur|cha&s;e,
for there it was our fortune to meet with a Rabbet, larded
it was, as all meat is in that Countrey, otherwi&s;e it is &s;o lean it
would be burnt up ere it could be roa&s;ted, it was &s;erved up with
the feet on, and the rea&s;on of the cu&s;tom thereof in that Country
is (I conceive) that being a frugal Nation, they would make them
go the further. The &s;ight of this Di&s;h gave us great content, but
when we came to eat thereof, it proved &s;o tough, that I verily
think it was no more than two removes from that Rabbet which
was in the Ark; but though it proved &s;o bad in the eating, the
price thereof was good enough, no le&s;s than Half a Crown Eng|li&s;h.
My Companion thought it to be very dear, but I adjudged
otherwi&s;e, for certainly the Gra&s;s which fed it was worth more
than eight times the money.</P>

<P>Now <HI>Mon&s;ieur,</HI> I &s;hall &s;peak &s;omething of what I ob&s;erved of the
women in your Country, and to begin with the Pea&s;ants, as being
mo&s;t in number: They are a &s;ort of people which cannot &s;ay the
lea&s;t claim to any &s;hare of beauty, &s;o that &s;he which with us is rec|koned
among&s;t the vulgar, would be among&s;t them e&s;teemed for a
Prince&s;s, quite contrary to the women in <HI>England,</HI> where you have
many thatched Cottages that harbour &s;uch Beauties, as would
tempt <HI>Jupiter</HI> from his Throne to court them in a golden Showre.
An&s;werable to their Beauty is their Attire, their head being wrap|ped
about with an old Di&s;h clout turned out of &s;ervice, or the cor|ner
of a Table-cloath re&s;erved from wa&s;hing; the goodne&s;s of
their faces tells us that that is &s;ufficient, for why &s;hould the back|part
of their head be hand&s;omer than the fore-part? They have no
need of Masks, and the Bacon-rined colour of their faces tells us
that they were &s;trangers to Bon graces when they were children.
As concerning Petticoats, they have all of them &s;uch a kinde of
Garment, but mo&s;t of them &s;o &s;hort, you would think them cut off
at the Placket; Now when the Parents have worn them till &s;uch
time as the rottenne&s;s of them will &s;ave a labor of undre&s;&s;ing, they
are a nevv cut out and fitted for the children, by vvhich time they
have done vvith them, they &s;peed to the dunghil, being &s;corned to
be taken up by the Rag-vvoman. For &s;hooes and &s;tockings they
take no great care for, few of them ever had above one pair in all
their lives, and vvhich they vvear every day, being very durable.
In this degree hath Nature placed them, and the greate&s;t happi|ne&s;s
that they do enjoy, is that they are contented vvith the &s;ame.</P>

<P>But vat is dis of de Pai&s;ant to de France Gentil woman.</P>

<SPEAKER>Engli&s;h-man.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, next I will &s;peak &s;omthing of the middle &s;ort of wo|men,
or &s;uch as live in Cities and great Towns, (for I &s;hall for|bear
to mention the Court, as being above my &s;phere) of the&s;e
&s;ort of women there is much difference from the Pea&s;ants; but
in what? &s;urely nothing but in attire, otherwi&s;e Nature hath
not been over prodigal to them for beauty, &s;o that <HI>Don Quixot</HI>
did not &s;o de&s;ervedly a&s;&s;ume to him&s;elf the title of <HI>The Knight
of the ill favoured face,</HI> as they may that of the <HI>Damo&s;els</HI> of it;
The mo&s;t comly and be&s;t proportioned part about them is their
hands, long, white, and &s;lender; but &s;carce &s;hall you &s;ee one
of a hundred, who&s;e wri&s;ts, and betwixt their fingers is no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">
all over-run with a &s;cab like to a lepro&s;ie. Their di&s;po&s;itions
hold good corre&s;pondency with their faces, and &s;uit as well as
a Toa&s;t and Nutmeg doth with a pot of Ale in the depth of Win|ter,
all which you will &s;wear to be truth, when you once come
but to hear them &s;peak; no better Character being to be ga|thered
of them, then from their prating, which is &s;o tedious
and infinite, that you &s;hall &s;ooner want ears than they Tongues;
&s;et but their Tongues once a going, and they are like to a
Watch, you need not winde them up above once in twelve hours,
for &s;o long will the Thread of their di&s;cour&s;e be in &s;pinning,
&s;uch everla&s;ting Talkers are they all, that they will &s;ooner
want breath then words, there being no wayes to &s;ilent them,
but only to go out of their Companies. But were this only to
&s;ome of their Familiars, it were the more tolerable, but &s;tran|ger
or acquaintance, all is one, though indeed no man is to
them a &s;tranger, for in two houres time you &s;hall have them as
familiar, and as merry with you, as if you had been of their ac|quaintance
&s;even yeares, or bred up in a hou&s;e together ever
&s;ince you were born; Now though I cannot condemn any of
them of di&s;hone&s;ty, as having had no &s;uch experience of them,
yet to an Engli&s;hman &s;uch &s;udden affability argues &s;omwhat of

much famed for rare fellows, but their skill con&s;i&s;ts not in

<P>Now you talk of ki&s;&s;ing, I cannot but much admire that humor
of the French women, who though (as I &s;aid before) they are &s;o
light and wanton in their di&s;cour&s;e and ge&s;tures, yet are &s;o coy of
<PB N="28" REF="15">
their Lips that they will not admit of a ki&s;s, accounting that wo|man
that is ki&s;&s;ed, more than half whored, be her deportment o|ther
wayes never &s;o civil&punc; Now, though I mu&s;t confe&s;s I like this
their cu&s;tom very well, it &s;paring me many an un&s;avory piece of
mannerline&s;s when I was among&s;t them, yet it was to me a kinde
of a &s;trange Riddle, that they &s;hould confine all immode&s;ty and
la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s to a harmle&s;s ki&s;s. But as it is &s;aid of the Italian,
<HI>That he will rather murther a man in private, than &s;peak ill of him
openly,</HI> &s;o it may be thought of the&s;e Damo&s;els, that they will not
refu&s;e a mans bed in private, although they deny to ki&s;s him
openly.</P>

<P>Yes <HI>Mon&s;ieur,</HI> I &s;hall tell you of a piece of Civility of one of
your Madams, as I was informed by an Acquaintance of mine
who was an Eye-witne&s;s to it. That being at a Tilting, a Rogui&s;h
Boy was peeking under a Ladies Coats, a Courtier &s;eeing it, went
about to remove him from that &s;awcy action: but when her La|dy&s;hip
perceived his intention, &s;he hindred him with this Com|plement,
<HI>Lai&s;&s;e Mon&s;ieur, lai&s;&s;e les yeux ne &s;ont pas larrons:</HI> The
boys eyes would &s;teal nothing away. Certainly tho&s;e who are
&s;o w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">nton in their di&s;cour&s;e and actions abroad, will not &s;tick out
of play, when Night and the Curtains may conceal it.</P>

<SPEAKER>Engli&s;h-man.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will not deny but there may be &s;ome of them very con&s;cien|tious,
but generally they are mo&s;t irreverent and irreligious;
great Scoffers, yea in matters of Religion, and at tho&s;e times
when they &s;hould be mo&s;t &s;olid, witne&s;s that Gallant who lying
on his Death-bed, when he had the <HI>Hoa&s;t</HI> (&s;o they call the Sacra|ment
of the Lords Supper) brought to him by a Lubberly Prie&s;t,
he &s;aid, <HI>That Chri&s;t came to him, as he went into</HI> Jeru&s;alem, <HI>riding&punc;
upon an A&s;s.</HI> Another of them being to receive the Sacrament,
<PB N="29" REF="15">
when the Prie&s;t had with many words per&s;waded him that the
Bread and Wine was the real Body and Blood of Chri&s;t, he refu|&s;ed
to ta&s;te of it, becau&s;e it was then Fryday. And I was infor|med
by a Gentleman, that at a Ma&s;s in the <HI>Cordeliers</HI> Church in
<HI>Paris,</HI> he &s;aw two French Papi&s;ts, when the mo&s;t &s;acred My&s;tery
of their Faith was celebrating, break out into &s;uch a bla&s;phemous
and athei&s;tical laughter, that even an <HI>Ethnick</HI> would have blu&s;hed
to have heard it. Can we then think the&s;e men to be religious,
who make a &s;coff at the Divine My&s;teries of our Salvation? Cer|tainly
had a <HI>Lutheran</HI> done this, &s;ome French hot-head or other,
would have &s;ent them laughing to <HI>Pluto.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Engli&s;h-man.</SPEAKER>
<P>I remember dat old woman very well, who was of &s;uch an age,
that it is que&s;tionable whether &s;he were ever young or no: for,
but that I have read the Scriptures, otherwi&s;e I &s;hould have been
apt to have believed that &s;he was one of the fir&s;t Pieces of the
Creation, and that by &s;ome mi&s;chance or other &s;he had &s;caped
the Flood: Our Countrey-man <HI>Tom. Parr</HI> the <HI>Salopian Wonder,</HI>
was but an Infant to her; at the lea&s;t you could not but have ima|gined
her one of the Reliques of the fir&s;t Age after the building of
<HI>Babel,</HI> &s;everal Ages before the birth of the <HI>Wandring Jew;</HI> her
face was for all the world like unto that of <HI>Sibylla Erythrea</HI> in an
old Print, or like that of <HI>Solomons</HI> two Harlets in the Painted
Cloth, or like tho&s;e Statuas on the out-&s;ide of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey,</HI>
which for the&s;e &s;ix hundred years have been expo&s;ed to winde and
weather. It is doubtful whether our Arch Poet <HI>Ed. Spen&s;er,</HI> when
he writ his Poem of <HI>The Ruines of Time,</HI> did not purpo&s;ely in|tend
it of her; &s;ure I am it is very appliable in the Title. Now
by rea&s;on that all her Teeth were out, her Tongue was boundle&s;s,
and without cea&s;ing would move for &s;ix and twenty hours toge|thet,
the fa&s;tidious pratler which <HI>Horace</HI> mentioneth in his <HI>Ninth
Satyr,</HI> was but a Poi&s;ne to her. Now whether &s;he be living &s;till,
<PB N="30" REF="16">
or no, I know not, but if &s;he once come to be &s;peechle&s;s, I &s;up|po&s;e
&s;he is then pa&s;t all recovery.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Engli&s;h-man.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well <HI>Mon&s;ieur,</HI> onely one word before you go, and then fare|well.
There is an old Proverb, that the Emperor of <HI>Germany</HI> is
<HI>Rex Regom,</HI> the King of <HI>Spain</HI> is <HI>Rex Hominem,</HI> the King of
<HI>France Rex A&s;inorum,</HI> and the King of <HI>England Rex Diabalo|rum.</HI>
The Emperor of <HI>Germany</HI> is called <HI>Rex Regem,</HI> in re&s;pect
of having &s;o many free Princes under him, who have power of
them&s;elves to Coyn Money, rai&s;e Soldiers, and other Immuni|ties
con&s;enant to Regal Authority. The King of <HI>Spain Rex Ho|minem,</HI>
for that his Subjects are &s;o con&s;tant and faithful in their
Allegiance, not que&s;tioning what the Prince does, but obeying
becau&s;e he &s;o commands it. The King of <HI>France</HI> is called <HI>Rex
A&s;inorum,</HI> becau&s;e of the Subjects patient bearing of tho&s;e in&s;up|portable
Taxes which he &s;ucks out of their &s;weat and blood. Pride
in matters of Sumptuou&s;ne&s;s, and the Civil Wars which la&s;ted a
long time in that Countrey, having occa&s;ioned mo&s;t of the Crown
Lands to have been &s;old or mortgaged, &s;o that the Subject is
now onely the Revenue of the Crown. The Kings hand lying &s;o
heavy upon them, that it hath almo&s;t thru&s;t them into an <HI>Egyp|tian</HI>
bondage: To recite all tho&s;e Impo&s;itions which this mi&s;er|able
people are afflicted withal, were almo&s;t as wretched as the
payment of them, I &s;hall briefly in&s;tance in &s;ome few, and fir&s;t
<HI>Gabelle de Sel,</HI> or Gabel on Salt, which is an Impo&s;ition that no
man in the Kingdom (&s;ome few Countries excepted) can eat any
Salt, but he mu&s;t buy it of the King, and at his price; but this
is not all, for though through poverty many of them could be con|tented
to eat meat (when they can get it) without Salt, yet are
they forced to take &s;uch a quantity of it, or how&s;oever they will
have of them &s;o much money. This Impo&s;ition is exacted with
&s;uch uncon&s;cionable rigour, that it is thought to be worth unto
the King 3000000 of Crowns yearly. Next is the <HI>Taillon,</HI> a
<PB N="31" REF="16">
heavy burthen which lies almo&s;t altogether upon the poor Pea|&s;ant,
who are a people of any other the mo&s;t unfortunate, paying
&s;uch infinite Rents to their Lords, and &s;uch innumerable Taxes
to the King, that all their care and extream labour is onely &s;uffi|cient
to pay their Duties, and keep them from the extremities of
cold and famine. This Impo&s;ition was at fir&s;t levyed by way of
Extraordinary Sub&s;idy, and lay alike heavy upon all, but now it is
confined onely to the Pea&s;ant; the greater Towns, the Of|ficers
of the Kings Hou&s;e, the Officers of War, the Pre&s;ident,
Councellors, and Officers of the Courts of Parliament, the No|bility,
the Clergy, and the Scholars of the Univer&s;ity, being freed
from it. Divers Impo&s;ts have they be&s;ides, as the Soll upon the
Liure, which is the twentieth penny of all things bought or &s;old,
onely <HI>Corn</HI> and <HI>Sallets</HI> excepted. Impo&s;ts upon Wine double and
treble, and after all this, the poor Vintner forced to pay the 8th
penny of that Wine which he &s;elleth, to the King. Then is there
be&s;ides Impo&s;ts on all &s;orts of Fruits, Provi&s;ions, Wares, and Mer|chandize,
to which we may adde the ba&s;e and corrupt money in it,
being for the mo&s;t part made of Tin and Bra&s;s. Hardly &s;hall you
&s;ee a Piece of Gold of the French &s;tamp, &s;carce any but what
comes out of <HI>Spain,</HI> which are very ill proportioned, and which
one re&s;embles to a French Chee&s;e, being neither long, nor &s;quare,
nor round, nor thick, nor thin, nor great, nor little, nor any one
of the&s;e, but yet all, and yet none of them.</P>
<P>The&s;e Circum&s;tances con&s;idered, we may the clearer &s;ee our
own felicities, which to expre&s;s in a word, is to &s;ay onely this,
<HI>That the Engli&s;h Subject is in no circum&s;tance a French man,</HI> though
we are &s;o blinde as herein not to &s;ee our own happine&s;s, but by
our often Rebellions have given occa&s;ion to that Apellation, that
the King of <HI>England</HI> is <HI>Rex Diabalorum.</HI></P>
