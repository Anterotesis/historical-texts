<OPENER><SALUTE>_MOst excellent Prince:</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>my Author (knowing that there are &s;omeworks &s;o naturally great of them&s;elues, that they challenge the gratious protecti|on of Princes) hath offered this his Hi&s;torie to the Royall patronage of the most Christian King, two Queenes, and the Dauphin, to the end it might &s;tirre them the more to pro&s;ecute the popula|ting of the lands heerein de&s;cribed, to bring the Naturals thereof (Sauage and mi&s;erable people) to ciuilitie and right knowledge of God, and &s;o to the &s;aluation of their &s;oules. A&s;&s;uming the like pre&s;umption, I haue hoped (notwith&s;tan|ding the defects which nece&s;&s;arily attend a &s;tranger, who can neuer attaine the naturall <HI>Idiome</HI> of this eloquent lan|guage) that it might not be an iniury to your Highne&s;&s;e; but an addition of Honor, and &s;afetie of tbis worke, if I &s;hould dare to in&s;cribe your Princely name on the forehead there|of Which bouldne&s;&s;e, the noble vndertaking of the Engli&s;h Nation hath nouri&s;hed, who haue &s;o lately begun (by the permi&s;sion, and vnder the protection of his excellent Maie|&s;tie, your mo&s;t Royall Father) to plant Chri&s;tianitie in Vir|ginia, being one continent, &amp; next adioining land to the&s;e.
<PB REF="3">
For who may better &s;upport, and manage magnanimous actions, &s;uch as be the peopling of lands, planting of Colo|ries, erecting of ciuill Gouernementes, and propagating of the Go&s;pell of Chri&s;t, (which are Royall and Princely foun|dations) then tho&s;e whom the King of Kings, hath establi|&s;hed as <HI>Atla&s;&s;es</HI> of kingdoms &amp; Chri&s;tian common weales? God hath nece&s;sitated in his Prophecie, Kings and Queenes to be nur&s;ing Fathers and nur&s;ing Mothers of his Church: &s;o that he hath not onely committed the gouernment of a ripe and &s;trong body, able to &s;ub&s;ist, but hath impo&s;ed the care of the tenderne&s;&s;e and infancie thereof vpon them. A|lexander being yet young, would haue runne in the Olym|pian games if kings had runne there; now Kings doe run; now Princes doe worke in the Lords harue&s;t, to &s;pread that name which must gather the elect from the vtmost endes of the world, if not in their per&s;ons, yet with their authori|tie and meanes. I know your Highne&s;&s;e would not be inferi|our, but rather excell in &s;o noble an action: &s;uch an emula|tion is plea&s;ing to God; your birth leadeth vnto it; Chri&s;ti|an charitie inuiteth you to be chiefe worker in the &s;auing of millions of &s;oules: The nece&s;sitie of your Countrie of Great <HI>BRITAINE,</HI> (ouer populous) doth require it: And la&s;tly your poore Virginians doe &s;eeme to implore your Princely aide, to helpe them to &s;hake off the yoke of the diuel, who hath hitherto made them liue wor&s;e then bea&s;ts, that hence|foorth they may be brought into the fould of Christ, and (in time) to liue vnder your Chri&s;tian gouernme~t: So then hauing thus runne, you &s;hall obtaine an euerla&s;ting Crowne of glory, being as well planter, as defender of the Faith.</P>

<P>The whole volume of the Nauigations of the French nation into the We&s;t Indies (compri&s;ed in three bookes) was brought to mee, to be tran&s;|lated, by M. Richard Hackluyt, a man, who for his worthy, and profitable labours, is well know|en to mo&s;t men of worth, not onely of this kingdome, but al&s;o of forrain parts: and by him this part was &s;elect|ed and cho&s;en from the whole worke, for the particu|lar v&s;e of this Nation, to the end, that comparing the goodne&s;&s;e of the lands of the Northerly parts heerein mentioned with that of <HI>Virginia,</HI> which (though in one, and the &s;elfe &s;ame continent and both lands adioyning) mu&s;t be far better, by rea&s;on it &s;tands more Southerly, neerer to the Sunne, greater encouragement may be giuen to pro&s;ecute that generous and godly action, in planting and peopling that Country, to the better pro|pagation of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, the &s;aluation of innu|merable &s;oules, and generall benefit of this land, too much pe&s;tred with ouer many people. Which tran&s;la|tion (as I haue &s;aid) is but a part of a greater volume. If therefore you finde that &s;ome references of things men|tioned in the former part of the &s;aid volume are not to be found in this tran&s;lation, do not thinke it &s;trange, in a&s;much as they could not wel be brought in, except the whole volume &s;hould be tran&s;lated, which of purpo&s;e was left vndone, as well to auoid your farther charges, as becau&s;e it was thought needle&s;&s;e to tran&s;late more then concerneth that which adioyneth to <HI>Virginia.</HI>

What good the Engli&s;h Nation may reape of this worke, by the onely de&s;cription that is found therein of Nations, Ilands, Harbours, Bayes, Coa&s;ts, Riuers, Rockes, Shoulds, Sands, Bankes, and other dangers, which the Saylers into tho&s;e parts may now the more ea&s;ily finde, and auoid, by the knowledge that this tran&s;lation giueth them of it, let the Nauigators iudge therof, who (for want of &s;uch knowledge) haue found them&s;elues in euident perill of death, and many alto|gether ca&s;t away. If a man that &s;heweth foorth effe|ctually the zealous care he &punc;hath to the well-fare, and common good of his country, de&s;erueth prai&s;es of the &s;ame, I refer to the iudgement of them that abhor the vice of ingratitude (hatefull aboue all to God, &amp; good|men) whether the &s;aid M. Hackluyt (as well for the fir&s;t procuring of this tran&s;lation, as for many workes of his, &s;et out by him for the good, and euerla&s;ting fame of the Engli&s;h Nation) de&s;erueth not to reape thankes. As for this my labour, if it be cen&s;ured fauorably, and my good affection (in vndertaking the tran&s;la|ting of this worke, for the benefit of this land) taken in good part, it will en|courage me to endeauour my &s;elfe to doe better heereafter.</P>

<P>AL New France in the end being conteined in two &s;hips, they waighed ankers from Porte <HI>Du Mout|ton,</HI> for to imploy their time, and to di&s;couer lands as much as might before Winter. We came to <HI>Cape de Sa|ble,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cap De Sable,</HI> or the Sandie Cape. Saint Maries Baye. Faire place to inhabite. Mines of Iron and Sil|uer.</NOTE>or the Sandie Cape; and from thence we &s;ailed to the Baie of <HI>Saint Marie,</HI> where our men lay at anker fifteene daies, while&s;t the lands and pa&s;&s;ages as well by &s;ea as by riuer might be de&s;cried and knowen. This Baye is a very faire place to inhabite, becau&s;e that one is readily carried thither without doubling. There are mines of Iron &amp; Sil|uer; but in no great abundance, according to the triall made thereof in France. Hauing &s;oiorned there &s;ome 12 or 13 daies, a &s;trange accident hapned, &s;uch as I will tell you. There was a certaine Churchman of a good fa|milie in Paris, that had a de&s;ire to performe the voyage with <HI>Mon&s;ieur De Monts,</HI> and that again&s;t the liking of his friends, who &s;ent expre&s;ly to <HI>Honfleur</HI> to diuert him therof, and to bring him backe to Paris. The &s;hips lying at anker in the &s;aid Baye of <HI>Saint Marie,</HI> he put him&s;elfe in <NOTE PLACE="marg">An acci|dent of a man lo&s;t in the woods the &s;pace of 16. daies.</NOTE>companie with &s;ome that went to &s;port them&s;elues in the woods.

returned backe to &s;eeke it: but hauing found it, forgetfull from what part he came, and not con&s;idering whether he &s;hould goe Ea&s;t or We&s;t, or otherwi&s;e (for there was no path) he tooke his way quite contrarie, turning his backe from his companie, and &s;o long trauelled that hee &s;ound him&s;elfe at the &s;ea &s;hoare, where no &s;hips were to be &s;een, (for they were at the other &s;ide of a nooke of land farre reaching into the &s;ea) he imagined that he was for&s;aken, and began to bewaile his fortune vpon a rocke. The night being come, euery one being retired, he is found wanting: hee was asked for of tho&s;e that had beene in the woods, they report in what maner he departed from them, and that &s;ince they had no newes of him. Whereupon a Pro|te&s;tant was charged to haue killed him, becau&s;e they quarrelled &s;ometimes for matters of Religion. Finally, they &s;ounded a trumpet thorow the fore&s;t, they &s;hot off the Canon diuers times, but in vaine: for the roaring of the Sea, &s;tronger than all that, did expell backe the &s;ound of the &s;aid Canons and trumpets. Two, three and foure daies pa&s;&s;e, he appeareth not. In the meane while the time ha|&s;tens to depart, &s;o hauing taried &s;o long that hee was then held for dead, they weighed ankers to goe further, and to <NOTE PLACE="marg">La Baye Fran|&ccedil;oi&s;e.</NOTE>&s;ee the depth of a Baye that hath &s;ome 40 leagues length, and 14 (yea 18) of bredth, which was named <HI>La Baye Francoi&s;e,</HI> or the French Baye.</P>
<P>In this Bay is the pa&s;&s;age to come into a Port, wherein|to our men entred, &amp; made &s;ome abode, during the which they had the plea&s;ure to hunt an Ellan, or Stagge, that cro&s;&s;ed a great lake of the Sea, which maketh this Port, and did &s;wimme but ea&s;ily.

There are three or foure mountains, imminent a|boue the others, on the &s;ides: But on the North &s;ide, from whence the riuer runneth downe, there is but a &s;harpe pointed one, aboue two leagues di&s;tant.

As for the exerci&s;e and occupation of our Frenchmen, during the time of their abode there, we will mention it briefely, hauing fir&s;t conducted backe our &s;hips into France.</P>
<P>The Sea and maritime charges in &s;uch enterpri&s;es as that of <HI>Mon&s;ieur De Monts,</HI> be &s;o great, that he who hath not a good &s;tocke and foundation &s;hall ea&s;ilie &s;inke vnder &s;uch a burthen, and for to &s;upplie, in &s;ome &s;ort, tho&s;e expences, one is forced to &s;uffer and beare infinite di&s;commodities, and put him&s;elfe in danger to bee di&s;credited among vn|knowen people, and which is wor&s;e, in a land which is vn|manured, and all ouer growen with fore&s;ts. Wherein this action is the more generous, by &s;o much as the perill is more euidently dangerous; and notwith&s;tanding all this, fortune is not left vnattempted, and to treade downe &s;o ma|ny thornes that &s;top the way. <HI>Mon&s;ieur De Monts</HI> his &s;hipes returning into France, he remaineth in a de&s;olate place, with one barke and one boate onely.

of the French name, which by this meanes is made ridicu|lous and a by word to other nations.

<P>Now let vs prepare and hoi&s;e vp &s;ailes. <HI>Mon&s;ieur De Poutrincourt</HI> made the voyage into the&s;e parts with &s;ome men of good &s;ort, not to winter there, but as it were to &s;eeke out his &s;eat, and finde out a land that might like him.

<P>THe Spring time &s;ea&s;on being pa&s;&s;ed in the voyage of the <HI>Armouchiquois, Mon&s;ieur De Monts</HI> did tem|pori&s;e at Saint <HI>Croix</HI> for the time that he had agreed

This time was alreadie expired, and they were readie to &s;et &s;ailes, not expecting more any &s;uc|cour <NOTE PLACE="marg">The arriuall of <HI>Mon&s;ieur Du Pont.</HI> 1605.</NOTE>nor refre&s;hing, When <HI>Mon&s;ieur Du Point,</HI> &s;urnamed <HI>Grau&egrave;,</HI> dwelling at <HI>Honfleur,</HI> did arriue with a company of &s;ome fortie men, for to ea&s;e the &s;aid <HI>Mon&s;ieur De Monts</HI> and his troupe, which was to the great ioy of all, as one may well imagine: and canon &s;hots were free and plentiful at the comming, according to cu&s;tome, and the &s;ound of trumpets. The &s;aid <HI>Mon&s;ieur Du Pont,</HI> not knowing yet the &s;tate of our French men, did thinke to finde there an a&s;&s;ured dwelling, and his lodgings readie: but con&s;idering the accidents of the &s;trange &s;ickne&s;&s;e whereof we haue &s;poken, he tooke aduice to change place. <HI>Mon&s;ieur De Monts</HI> was very de&s;irous that the new habitation had beene about 40. degrees, that is to &s;ay, 4. degrees farther then <HI>Saint Croix:</HI> but hauing viewed the coa&s;t as farre as <HI>Malebarre,</HI> and with much paine, not finding what hee de&s;ired, it was deliberated to goe and make their dwel|ling in <HI>Port Royal,</HI> vntill meanes were had to make an am|pler <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tran&s;migra|tion from S. <HI>Croix</HI> to <HI>Port Royal.</HI></NOTE>di&s;couery. So euery one began to packe vp his things: That which was built with infinite labour was pulled downe, except the Store-hou&s;e, which was too great and painefull to be tran&s;ported, and in executing of this, many voyages are made. All being come to <HI>Port Royal</HI> they found out new labours: the abiding place is cho&s;en right <NOTE PLACE="marg">New buil|dings.</NOTE>ouer again&s;t the Iland, that is at the comming in of the ri|uer <HI>L' Equille,</HI> in a place where all is couered ouer and full of woods, as thicke as po&s;&s;ible may be. The Moneth of September did already begin to come, and care was to be taken for the vnlading of <HI>Mon&s;ieur Du Pont</HI> his &s;hip, to make roome for them that &s;hould returne backe into France. Finally there is worke enough for all. When the

&s;hip was in a readine&s;&s;e to put to &s;ailes, <HI>Mon&s;ieur De Monts</HI> hauing &s;eene the beginning of the new habitation, &s;hipped him&s;elfe for his returne with them that would fol|low him. Notwith&s;tanding many of good courage (for|getting the griefes and labours pa&s;&s;ed) did tary behinde, among&s;t whom were <HI>Mon&s;ieur Champlain</HI> and <HI>Mon&s;ieur Champdor&egrave;,</HI> the one for <HI>Geographie,</HI> and the other for the conducting and guiding of the voyages that &s;hould be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to be made by &s;ea.

BEing come to Rochell, we found there <HI>Mon&s;ieur De Monts,</HI> and <HI>Mon&s;ieur De Poutrincourt,</HI> that were come in Po&s;t, and our &s;hip called the <HI>Ionas,</HI> of the burthen of 150. tonnes, readie to pa&s;&s;e out of the chaines of the Towne, to tary for winde and tyde. The tyde I &s;ay, becau&s;e that a great &s;hip laden, cannot come to &s;ea from Rochell, but in &s;pring tydes, vpon the new and full moone, by rea&s;on that in the towne roade there is no &s;ufficient depth. In the meane while we made good cheare, yea &s;o good, that we did long to be at &s;ea to make diet: which we did but too &s;oone, being once come thither: for during two whole monethes we &s;aw not a whit of land, as we will farther tell anone. But the workemen, thorow their good cheare (for they had euery one two &s;hillings a daies hire) <NOTE PLACE="marg">The prai&s;es of Rochell.</NOTE>did play maruellous pranckes in Saint Nicholas quarter, where they were lodged, which was found &s;trange in a towne &s;o reformed as Rochell is, in the which no notorious riots nor di&s;&s;olutions be made; and indeed one mu&s;t behaue him&s;elfe orderly there, vnle&s;&s;e he will incurre the danger either of the cen&s;ure of the Maior, or of the Mini&s;ters of the Towne. Some of tho&s;e di&s;ordered men were put in pri&s;on, which were kept in the Towne-hou&s;e till the time of going, and had beene further puni&s;hed, had it not beene vpon con&s;ideration of the voyage, where they knew they &s;hould not haue all their ea&s;es, but &s;hould afterwards pay deere enough their madde bargen, in putting the &s;aid Ma|&s;ter <HI>Macquin</HI> and Ma&s;ter <HI>Georges</HI> to &s;o much trouble, to keepe them in order. I will not, for all that, put in the num|ber of this di&s;ordred people, al the re&s;t, for there were &s;ome <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Croquans</HI> (Sig|nifying hookes) why &s;o called.</NOTE>very ciuill and re&s;pectiue.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Negligence in the keep|ing of the <HI>Ionas.</HI></NOTE> Our <HI>Ionas</HI> hauing her full loade, was in the end rowed out of the Towne into the roade, and we thought to &s;et out the 8. or 9. of Aprill. Captaine <HI>Foulques</HI> had taken the charge for the conducting of the voyage. But as common|monly there is negligence in mens bu&s;ine&s;&s;es, it hapned that this Captaine (who notwith&s;tanding I haue knowen very diligent and watchfull at &s;ea) hauing left the &s;hip ill manned, not being in her him&s;elfe, nor the Pilot, but only 6. or 7. mariners good and bad, a great South-ea&s;t winde aro&s;e in the night, which brake the <HI>Ionas</HI> cable, fa&s;tend with one onely ancker, and driueth her again&s;t a forewall which is out of the towne, backing and proping the Tow|er of the chaine, again&s;t which &s;he &s;trake &s;o many times, that &s;he brake and &s;unke downe; and it chanced well that it was then ebbing, for if this mi&s;hap had come in flowing time, the &s;hip was in danger to be ouerwhelmed with a farre greater lo&s;&s;e then we had, but &s;he &s;tood vp, and &s;o there was means to mend her, which was done with &s;peed. Our workemen were warned to come and helpe in this ne|ce&s;&s;ity, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hyred work|men negli|gent.</NOTE>either to draw at the pompe, at the Cape&s;tane, or to any other thing; but few there were that endeuoured them&s;elues to doe any thing, the mo&s;t part of them going away, and mo&s;t of them made a mocke of it. Some hauing gone &s;o far as to the oare, went backe complaining that one had ca&s;t water vpon them, being of that &s;ide that the wa|ter came out of the pompe, which the winde did &s;catter vpon them. I came thither with <HI>Mon&s;ieur De Poutrin|court,</HI> and &s;ome other willing men, where wee were not vnprofitable. Almo&s;t all the inhabitants of Rochell were beholding this &s;pectacle vpon the rampiers. The &s;ea was
<PB N="62" REF="41">
yet &s;tormy, and we thought our &s;hip would haue da&s;hed oftentimes again&s;t the great Towers of the towne. In the end, we came in with le&s;&s;e lo&s;&s;e then wee thought of. The &s;hip was all vnladen, being forced to tackle and furni&s;h her anew. The lo&s;&s;e thereby was great, and the voyages al|mo&s;t broken off for euer: for I beleeue, that after &s;o many trials, none would haue ventured to goe plant Colonies in tho&s;e parts; that Country being &s;o ill &s;poken of, that eue|ry one did pittie vs, con&s;idering the accidents happened to <NOTE PLACE="marg">The courage of <HI>Mon&s;ieur De Monts</HI> and his a&s;&s;ociates.</NOTE>them that had beene there before.

And I mu&s;t needs be &s;o bold as to tel in this occurra~ce that if euer that country be inhabited with Chri&s;tians and ciuill people, the fir&s;t prai&s;e thereof mu&s;t of right be due to the Authors of this voyage.</P>
<P>This great trouble hindered vs aboue a moneth, which was emploied in the vnlading, and lading againe of our &s;hip. During that time, we did walke &s;ometimes vnto the places neere about the towne, and chiefly vnto the Con|vent of the Cordeliers, which is but halfe a league off from <NOTE PLACE="marg">The fron|tiers ought to be furni|&s;hed with good Soul|diers.</NOTE>the towne: where being one Sunday, I did maruell how in tho&s;e places of frontier, there is no better garri&s;on, having &s;o &s;trong enemies neere them. And &s;eeing I take in hand to relate an hi&s;tory of things, according to the true maner of them: I &s;ay that it is a &s;hamefull thing for vs, that the Mi|ni&s;ters of Rochell, pray to God euery day in their Congre|gations <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mini&s;ters doe pray for the conuer&s;i|on of the Sa|uages.</NOTE>for the conuer&s;ion of the poore Sauage people, and al&s;o for our &s;afe conducting, and that our Church-men doe not the like. In very truth we neuer required neither the one nor the other to doe it, but therin is knowen the zeale of both &s;ides. In the end, a little before our departing, it came to my minde to aske of the Par&s;on or Vicar of Ro|chell if there might be found any of his fraternity that would come with vs, which I hoped might ea&s;ily be done, becau&s;e there was a rea&s;onable good number of them: and be&s;ides, that being in a maritime towne, I thought
<PB N="63" REF="41">
they tooke delight to haunt the &s;eas: but I could obtaine nothing: and for all excu&s;es, it was tolde me, that none would goe&punc; to &s;uch voyages, vnle&s;&s;e they were mooued with an extraordinary zeale and pietie: And that it would bee the be&s;t way to &s;eeke to the fathers&punc; Ie&s;uites for the &s;ame. Which we could not then doe, our &s;hip hauing almo&s;t her full lading. Whereupon I remember to haue heard oftentimes of <HI>Mon&s;ieur De Poutrincourt,</HI> that after his fir&s;t voiage, being at the Court, an Eccle&s;ia&s;ticall per|&s;on, e&s;teemed very zealous in the Chri&s;tian religion, de|manded of him what might be hoped for in the conuer&s;ion of the people of New France, and whether there were any great number of them. Whereunto he an&s;wered&punc; that a hundred thou&s;and &s;oules might be gotten to <HI>Ie&s;us Christ,</HI> (naming a number certaine for an vncertaine.) This Cler|gie man making &s;mall account of &s;uch a number, &s;aid ther|upon by admiration, <HI>is that all!</HI> as if that number did not de&s;erue the labour of a Church-man. Truly though there were but the hundreth part of that, yea yet le&s;&s;e, one mu&s;t not &s;uffer it to bee lo&s;t. The good Sheepheard hauing a|mong <NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 18. ver&s;. 12. 132.</NOTE>an hundred &s;heepe one a&s;tray, left the 99. for to go and &s;eeke out the one that was lo&s;t. We are taught &amp;) I be|leeue it &s;o) that though there were but one man to be &s;aued, our Lord <HI>Ie&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> had not di&s;dained to come, as well for him, as he hath done for all the world. In like maner, one mu&s;t not make &s;o &s;mal account of the &s;aluation of the&s;e poore people, though they &s;warme not in number as with|in Paris or Con&s;tantinople.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cu&s;tome of the ancient Chri&s;tians, carying the Euchari&s;t in their voyages.</NOTE> Seeing it auailed me nothing in demanding for a Church|man, to admini&s;ter the Sacrament vnto vs, be it during our nauigation, or vpon the land: The ancient cu&s;tome of the Chri&s;tians came into my minde, which going in voyage did carry with them the holy bread of the <HI>Eucharist,</HI> and this did they, becau&s;e they found not, in all places, Prie&s;ts to admini&s;ter this Sacrament vnto them, the world being then yet full, either of Heathens or Heretickes.

The 16. of May we met with 13. Holanders, go|ing for Spaine, which did inquire of our voyage, and &s;o held their cour&s;e. Since that time we were a whole moneth, &s;eeing nothing el&s;e out of our floting towne, but Skie and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Meeting of a Pirate or out|lawed.</NOTE>water, one &s;hip excepted, neere about the <HI>A&ccedil;ors,</HI> well fil|led with Engli&s;h and Dutchmen.

If one aske me the cau&s;e why: I wil an&s;wer, that I thinke it to proceed of a certaine conflict between the Ea&s;t &amp; we&s;terly windes, which doe encounter in that part of the &s;ea, and e&s;pecially in Summer, when the We&s;t windes doe ri&s;e vp, and with a great force pierce and pa&s;&s;e thorow a great di&s;tance of &s;ea, vntill they finde the windes of the&s;e parts, which doe re&s;i&s;t them; Then it is dangerous for a &s;hip to be at the&s;e windy encounters. This rea&s;on &s;eemeth the more probable vnto me, in this, that vntill we came neere the <HI>A&ccedil;ores</HI> we had the
<PB N="67" REF="43">
winde fit enough, and afterward, we had almo&s;t alwaies either South-we&s;t or Norwea&s;t, little North and South, which were not good for vs, but to &s;aile with the bowline: For Ea&s;terly windes we had none at all, but once or twice, <NOTE PLACE="marg">We&s;terly windes ordi|nary in the We&s;terne Sea.</NOTE>which continued nothing with vs (to &s;peake of.) Sure it is that the We&s;terly windes doe raigne much a long that &s;ea, Whether it be by a certaine repercu&s;&s;ion of the Ea&s;t winde which is &s;tiffe and &s;wift vnder the Equinoctiall line, wher|of we haue &s;poken el&s;e-where, or becau&s;e that this We&s;tern land, being large and great, al&s;o the winde that i&s;&s;ueth from thence doth abound the more. Which commeth e&s;peci|ally in Summer, when the &s;unne hath force to draw vp the <NOTE PLACE="marg">from whence the windes doe come.</NOTE>vapors of the earth, for the windes come from thence, i&s;&s;u|ing from the dennes and Caues of the &s;ame. And therefore the Poets doe faine that <HI>Aeolus</HI> holdeth them in pri&s;ons, from whence hee draweth them, and giueth them liberty when it plea&s;eth him. But the &s;pirit of God doth confirm it vnto vs yet better, when he &s;aith by the mouth of the Pro|phet, that Almighty God, among other his maruels, draw|eth <NOTE PLACE="marg">P&s;al. 135.</NOTE>the windes out of his trea&s;ures, which be the Caues whereof I &s;peake.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the word Bancke: and de&s;cription of the fi&s;hing Bancke.</NOTE> Heere I will, before I proceed any further, decipher vnto you, what meaneth this word <HI>(Bancke)</HI> which paraduen|ture putteth &s;ome in paine to know what it is. They &s;om|times call Banckes a &s;andy bottome which is very &s;hallow, or which is a drie at low water. Such places be mortall for &s;hips that meete with them. But the Bancke whereof we &s;peake, are mountaines grounded in the depth of the wa|ters, which are rai&s;ed vp to 30. 36. and 40. fadams, neere to the vpper face of the &s;ea. This Bancke is holden to be of 200. leagues in lenght: and 18. 20. and 24. leagues broad, which being pa&s;&s;ed there is no more bottome found out, then in the&s;e parts, vntill one come to the land. The &s;hips being there arriued, the &s;ailes are rowled vp, and there, fi&s;hing is made of the greene fi&s;h, as I haue &s;aid, whereof we &s;hall &s;peake in the booke following. For the &s;atisfying of my reader, I haue drawen it in my Geogra|phy call Map of New-found-land, with prickes, which is all may be done to repre&s;ent it. There is, farther off, other banckes, as I haue marked in the &s;aid Map, vpon the which good fi&s;hing may be made: and many goe thither that know the places. When that we parted from Rochel, there was (as it were) a forre&s;t of &s;hips lying at <HI>Chef de Bois,</HI>

<P>Hauing &s;eene and noted the Bancke, wee hoi&s;ted vp &s;ailes and bare all night, keeping &s;till our cour&s;e to the We&s;t. But the dawne of day being come, which was Saint <NOTE PLACE="marg">The fi&s;hing of Cod.</NOTE>Iohn Bapti&s;ts Eue, in Gods name we pulled downe &s;ailes, pa&s;&s;ing that day a fi&s;hing of Cod-fi&s;h, with a thou&s;and mirthes and contentments, by rea&s;on of fre&s;h meates, whereof we had a&s;much as we would, hauing long before wi&s;hed for them. <HI>Mon&s;ieur De Poutrincourt,</HI> and a yong man of <HI>Retel</HI> named <HI>Le Feure,</HI> who, by rea&s;on of the &s;ea|&s;ickne&s;&s;e were not come out from their beds nor cabanes, from the beginning of the Nauigation, came vpon the hatches that day, and had the plea&s;ure, not onely of fi&s;hing of Cod, but al&s;o of tho&s;e birds, that bee called by French mariners, <HI>Happe-foyes,</HI> that is to &s;ay <HI>Liuer-catchers,</HI> becau&s;e <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Happe-foyes</HI> Why &s;o cal|led.</NOTE>of their greedine&s;&s;e to deuour the liuers of the Cod-fi&s;hes that are ca&s;t into the &s;ea, after their bellies bee opened, whereof they are &s;o couetous, that though they &s;ee a great powle ouer their heads, ready to &s;trike them downe, yet they aduenture them&s;elues to come neere to the &s;hip, to catch &s;ome of them, at what price &s;oeuer.

But in this action one of our &s;hip|wrights fell downe in the &s;ea.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sea-dogges skinnes.</NOTE> In this fi&s;hing we &s;ometimes did take &s;ea-dogges, who&s;e skinnes our Ioyners did keepe carefully to &s;mooth their worke withall.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The weather in tho&s;e &s;eas contrary, then in ours.</NOTE> It is to be noted that from the 18. of Iune vntill wee did arriue at Port Royall, we haue found the weather quite otherwi&s;e to that we had before. For (as we haue already &s;aid) we had colde mi&s;tes or fogges, before our comming to the Bancke (where we came in faire &s;un&s;hine) but the next day, we fell to the fogges againe, which (a far off) we <NOTE PLACE="marg">The cau&s;es of mi&s;ts on the We&s;t &s;ea.</NOTE>might perceiue to come and wrappe vs about, holding vs continually pri&s;oners three whole daies, for two daies of faire weather that they permitted vs: which was alwaies accompanied with colde, by rea&s;on of the Summers ab|&s;ence. Yea euen diuers times wee haue &s;eene our &s;elues a whole &s;ennight, continually in thicke fogges, twice with|out any &s;hew of Sunne, but very little, as I will recite heereafter. And I will bring foorth a rea&s;on for &s;uch effects which &s;eemeth vnto me probable. As wee &s;ee the fire to draw the moi&s;tne&s;&s;e of a wet cloath, oppo&s;ite vnto it, like|wi&s;e the &s;unne draweth moi&s;tne&s;&s;e and vapours both from the &s;ea and from the land. But for the di&s;&s;oluing of them, there is heere one vertue, and beyond tho&s;e parts another,
<PB N="77" REF="48">
according to the accidents and circum&s;tances that are found. In the&s;e our countries it rai&s;eth vp vapours onely from the ground, and from our riuers: which earthly va|pours, gro&s;&s;e and waighty, and participating le&s;&s;e of the moi&s;t ellement, doe cau&s;e vs a hot aire, and the earth di&s;|charged of tho&s;e vapours, becomes thereby more hot and parching. From thence it commeth, that the &s;aid vapors, hauing the earth of the one part, and the Sunne on the o|ther, which heateth them, they are ea&s;ily di&s;&s;olued, not re|maining long in the aire, vnle&s;&s;e it be in winter, when the earth is waxen colde, and the Sunne beyond the <HI>Equinocti|all</HI> line, farre off from vs. From the &s;ame rea&s;on proceedeth the cau&s;e, why mi&s;tes and fogges be not &s;o frequent, nor &s;o long in the French &s;eas, as in New-found-land, becau&s;e that the Sunne, pa&s;&s;ing from his ri&s;ing, aboue the grounds, this &s;ea, at the comming thereof, receiueth almo&s;t but earthly vapours, and by a long &s;pace retaineth this vertue to di&s;&s;olue very &s;oone the exhalations it draweth to it &s;elfe. But when it commeth to the midde&s;t of the Ocean, and to the &s;aid new found land, hauing eleuated and a&s;&s;umed in &s;o long a cour&s;e a great abundance of vapours, from this moi&s;t wide Ocean, it doth not &s;o ea&s;ily di&s;&s;olue them, as well, becau&s;e tho&s;e vapours be colde of them&s;elues, and of their nature, as becau&s;e the Element which is neere&s;t vnder them, doth &s;impathize with them, and pre&s;erueth them, &amp; the Sunne beames being not holpen in the di&s;&s;oluing of them, as they are vpon the earth. Which is euen &s;eene in the land of that countrie, which (although it hath but &s;mall heat, by rea&s;on of the abundance of woods) not|with&s;tanding it helpeth to di&s;per&s;e the mi&s;tes and fogges, which be ordinarily there, in the morning, during &s;ummer, but not as at Sea, for about eight aclocke in the mor|ning they begin to vani&s;h away, and &s;erue as a dew to the ground.</P>

arriued there, on Mondy the la&s;t of Iuly, and tarried yet in Port Royall vntill the 28. of Augu&s;t.

<P>At the very beginning, we were de&s;irous to &s;ee the coun|try vp the riuer, where we found medowes, almo&s;t conti|nually aboue twelue leagues of ground, among which, brookes doe run without number, which come from the hils and mountaines adioyning. The woods very thicke on the water &s;hoares, and &s;o thicke, that &s;ometimes, one cannot goe thorow them.

<P>THe night beginning to giue place to the dawning of the day, the &s;ailes are hoi&s;ed vp, but it was but a ve|ry perilous nauigation.

than did our owne people: true it is, that by &s;ignes he com|prehended better than they what he would &s;ay. This Sa|uage &s;hewed the places, where no depth was, and where was any, and did &s;o well indenting and winding heere and there, alway the led in hand, that in the end they came to the Port &s;hewed by him, where &s;mall depth is: wherein the barke being arriued, diligence was v&s;ed to make a forge <NOTE PLACE="marg">A forge and an ouen made.</NOTE>for to mend her with her rudder, and an ouen to bake bread, becau&s;e there was no more bisket left.</P>
<P>Fifteene daies were imployed in this worke, during the which <HI>Mon&s;ieur De Poutrincourt,</HI> according to the lauda|ble <NOTE PLACE="marg">A cre&s;&s;e &s;et vp.</NOTE>cu&s;tome of Chri&s;tians, made a Cro&s;&s;e to be framed and &s;et vp, vpon a greene bancke, as <HI>Mon&s;ieur De Monts</HI> had done two yeeres before at <HI>Kinibeki</HI> and <HI>Malebarre.</HI> Now among the&s;e painefull exerci&s;es they gaue not ouer make|ing good cheere, with that which both the &s;ea and the land might furni&s;h in that part.

<P>After certaine daies, the &s;aid <HI>Mon&s;ieur De Poutrincourt,</HI> &s;eeing there great a&s;&s;embly of Sauages, came a&s;hore, and to giue them &s;ome terrour, made to march before him one <NOTE PLACE="marg">The triall of French wea|pons before the Sauages.</NOTE>of his men, flouri&s;hing with two naked &s;words.

Now his care was that we &s;hould haue good and wor&s;hipfull fare, which was &s;o well ob&s;erued, that (although the Belly-Gods of the&s;e parts doe often reproch vnto vs that we had not <HI>La Rue</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>La Rue aux Ours,</HI> or Beare &s;treet, is, as Pie-corner, or &s;uch a Cooke place in London.</NOTE><HI>aux Ours</HI> of Paris with vs) we haue ordinarily had there, as good cheare as we could haue at <HI>La Rue aux Ours,</HI> and at farre le&s;&s;er charges.

So well, that at breakfa&s;t we neuer wanted &s;ome modicum or other, of fi&s;h or fle&s;h: and at the repa&s;t of dinners and &s;uppers, yet le&s;&s;e; for it was the great banquet, where the Gouernour of the fea&s;t, or Steward (whom the Sauages doe call <HI>Atoctegi)</HI> hauing made the Cooke to make all things ready, did march with his napkin on his &s;houlder, and his &s;taffe of office in his hand, with the colar of the order about his necke, which was worth aboue foure crownes, and all them of the order following of him, bearing euery one a di&s;h. The like al&s;o was at the bringing in of the fruit, but not with &s;o great a traine. And at night after grace was &s;aid, he re&s;igned the Colar of the order, with a cup of wine, to his &s;ucce&s;&s;or in that charge, and they dranke one to another. I haue heere|tofore &s;aid that we had abundance of fowle, as Mallards, <HI>Outards,</HI> Gee&s;e, gray and whit, Partriges and other birds: Item, of <HI>Ellans</HI> (or &s;tagge fle&s;h) of <HI>Caribous</HI> (or Deere) Be|uers, Otters, Beares, Rabbets, Wilde-cats (or <HI>Leopards) Nibach&egrave;s</HI> and &s;uch like, which the Sauages did take, wher|with we made as good di&s;hes of meat, as in the Cookes &s;hops that be in <HI>La rue aux Ours</HI> (Beare &s;treet) and grea|ter &s;tore: for of all meates none is &s;o tender as <HI>Ellans</HI> fle&s;h (whereof we made good pa&s;ties) nor &s;o delicate as the Be|uerstaile.

<P>It was great griefe vnto vs to abandon (without hope of returne) a land that had produced vnto vs &s;o faire Corne, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Engli&s;h nation going to Virginia with a zea|lous intent to plant true re|ligion and &s;o to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 span">&s;e Chri&s;ts ble&s;|&s;ed flocke, no doubt he will be their lea|der.</NOTE>and &s;o many faire adorned gardens.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_ALmighty God, in the creation of this world, hath &s;o much deligh|ted him&s;elfe in diuer&s;ity, that, whether it be in Heauen, or in the Earth, either vnder the &s;ame or in the profound depth of wa|ters, the effects of his might and glory doe &s;hine in euery place. But the wonder that far exceedeth all others, is, that in one and the &s;elfe &s;ame kind of Creature, I meane in Man, are found more va|riety than in other things created. For if one enters in|to the con&s;ideration of his face, two &s;hall not be found who in euery re&s;pect doe re&s;emble one another: If he bee con&s;idered in the voice, the &s;ame variety &s;hall be found: If in the &s;peech, all Nations haue their proper and peculiar language, whereby one is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the other. But in maners and fa&s;hion of life, there is a maruellous difference, which (without troubling
<PB N="138" REF="80">
our &s;elues in cro&s;sing the Seas to haue the experience thereof) we &s;ee vi&s;ibly in our very neighborhood. Now fora&s;much as it is a &s;mall matter to know, that people differ from vs in cu&s;tomes and maners, vnles we know the particularities thereof; a &s;mall thing is it likewi&s;e to know, but that, which is neere to vs: but the faire Science is to know the maner of life of all Na|tions of the World, for which rea&s;on <HI>Vly&s;&s;es</HI> hath beene e&s;teemed, becau&s;e he had &s;eene much and knowen much.

<P>_THe authour of the booke of Wi&s;dome, called Salomon, witne&s;&s;eth vnto vs a mo&s;t true thing, that <HI>All men haue a like entrance into the world, and the like going out.</HI> But ech &s;euerall people hath brought &s;ome ceremonies, after the&s;e were accompli&s;hed. For &s;ome haue wept, &s;eeing the birth of man vpon this worldly Theater. Others haue reioyced at it, as well becau&s;e Nature hath giuen to euery creature a de&s;ire to pre&s;erue his owne kinde, as for that, Man hauing beene made mortall by &s;inne, he de&s;ireth to bee in &s;ome &s;ort re&s;tored againe to that lo&s;t right of immortality, and to leaue &s;ome vi&s;ible image i&s;&s;u|ed from him, by the generation of children. I will not heere di&s;cour&s;e vpon euery Nation, for it would be an infi|nite thing. But I will &s;ay that the <HI>Hebrews</HI> at the natiuity of their children did make &s;ome particular ceremonies vn|to them, &s;poken of by the Prophet <HI>Ezechiel,</HI> who hauing <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezech. 16. ver&s;. 23. 4.</NOTE>in charge to make a demon&s;tration to the Citie of <HI>Hieru&s;a|lem</HI> of her owne abomination, doth reproch vnto her, &s;aying, that &s;he is i&s;&s;ued and borne out of the <HI>Cananaeans</HI> Country, that her father was an <HI>Amorite,</HI> and her mo|ther an <HI>Hittite.</HI> And <HI>as for thy birth</HI> (&s;aith he) <HI>in the day that thou wast borne thy nauell was not cut, neither wast thou wa&s;h|ed in water to &s;often thee, nor &s;alted with &s;alt, nor any wi&s;e</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iulian. imp.

did plunge theirs into the riuer <HI>Rhine,</HI> to know if they <NOTE PLACE="marg">Augu&s;t. epi&s;t. ad Maxim.

As for our Sauages of New France, when that I was there, thinking nothing le&s;&s;e than on this Hi&s;tory, I tooke not heed of many things which I might haue ob&s;erued: But yet I remember, that as a woman was deliuered of her child they came into our Fort, to demand very in&s;tantly for &s;ome grea&s;e or oyle to make the child to &s;wallow it downe be|fore they giue him the dugge or any food: they can ren|der no rea&s;on for this, but that it is a cu&s;tome of long con|tinuance. Whereupon I coniecture that the diuell (who hath alwaies borrowed ceremonies from the Church, as well in the ancient as in the new law) would, that his peo|ple (&s;o doe I call them that beleeue not in God, and are out of the Communion of Saints) &s;hould be anointed like to Gods people: which vnction he hath made to be inward, becau&s;e the &s;pirituall vnction of the Chri&s;tians is &s;o.</P>

<P>I Will not call (as &s;ome haue done) by the name of Prie&s;ts, them that make the ceremonies and inuocations of di|uels among the We&s;t Indies, but in as much as they haue the v&s;e of &s;acrifices and gifts that they offer to their Gods, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hebr. 8. ver&s;. 3.</NOTE>for as much as (as the Apo&s;tle &s;aith) euery Prie&s;t or Bi&s;hop is ordained to offer gifts and &s;acrifices: &s;uch as were them of <HI>Mexico,</HI> the greate&s;t whereof was called <HI>Papas,</HI> who of|fered incen&s;e to their Idols, the chiefe of them was that of the god whom they did name <HI>Vitzilipuztli,</HI> although ne|uerthele&s;&s;e, the generall name of him, whom they held for &s;upreame Lord and author of all things, was <HI>Viracocha,</HI> to whom they attributed excellent qualities, calling him <HI>Pachacamac,</HI> which is, Creator of Heauen and Earth: and <HI>V&s;apu,</HI> which is, admirable, and other &s;uch like names. They had al&s;o &s;acrifices of men, as them of <HI>Perou</HI> haue yet, which they &s;acrificed in great number, as <HI>Io&s;eph Acosta</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioan. Aco&s;ta, lib. <HI>5.</HI> ch. <HI>20. 21.</HI></NOTE>di&s;cour&s;eth thereof at large. Tho&s;e may be called Prie&s;ts or Sacrificers: But in regard of them of <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Flori|da,</HI> I doe not &s;ee any &s;acrifices they make, and therefore I will qualifie them with the name of <HI>Wi&s;ards,</HI> or Ma&s;ters of the Ceremonies of their religion, which in <HI>Florida</HI> I finde to be called <HI>Iarvars,</HI> and <HI>Ioanas:</HI> in <HI>Virginia, Vuiroances:</HI> in <HI>Bra&s;ill Caribes:</HI> and among ours (I meane the <HI>Sori|quois) A&uuml;tmoins. Laudonniere,</HI> &s;peaking of <HI>Florida:</HI> <Q>They haue (&s;aith he) their Prie&s;ts, vnto whom they giue great credit, becau&s;e they be great Magicians, great Sooth&s;aiers and callers on diuels. The&s;e Prie&s;ts doe &s;erue them for Phy&s;icians and Chirurgians, and carrie alwaies with them a bagge full of hearbes and drugges to phy&s;icke them that be &s;icke, which be, the mo&s;t part, of the great pockes: for they loue women and maidens very much,</Q> whom they

call the daughters of the Sunne. If there be any thing to be treated, the King calleth the <HI>Iarvars,</HI> and the anciente&s;t men, and demandeth their aduice. See moreouer what I haue written heeretofore in the &s;ixt Chapter of the fir&s;t <NOTE PLACE="marg">Virginia.</NOTE>booke. As for them of <HI>Virginia,</HI> they are no le&s;&s;e &s;uttle than them of <HI>Florida,</HI> and do procure credit to them&s;elues, mak|ing them to be re&s;pected, by trickes or &s;hew of religion, like to them that we haue &s;poken of in the la&s;t chapter, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ato&s;ta <HI>6.</HI> booke ch. <HI>19.</HI></NOTE>&s;peaking of &s;ome dead men ri&s;en vp againe. It is by &s;uch meanes, and vnder pretect of religion that the <HI>Inguas</HI> made them&s;elues heeretofore the greate&s;t Princes of <HI>America.</HI> And them of the&s;e parts that would deceiue and blinde the people haue likewi&s;e v&s;ed of that &s;uttelty, as <HI>Numa Pom|pilius, Li&s;ander, Sertorius,</HI> and other more recent, doing (as &s;aith <HI>Plutarke)</HI> as the plaiers of tragedies, who de&s;irous to &s;hew foorth things, ouerreaching the humane &s;trength, haue refuge to the &s;uperior power of the Gods.</P>
<P>The <HI>Aoutmoins</HI> of the la&s;t land of the <HI>Indies</HI> which is the neere&s;t vnto vs, are not &s;o blocki&s;h but that they can make the common people to attribute &s;ome credit vnto them. For by their impo&s;tures they liue and make them&s;elues e&s;teemed to be nece&s;&s;ary, playing the part of Phy&s;icions and Chirurgions as well as the <HI>Floridians.</HI> Let the great <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Phy&s;ici|ons and Chi|rurgions of the Sauages.</NOTE><HI>Sagamos Membertou</HI> be an example thereof. If any body be &s;icke, he is &s;ent for, he maketh inuocations on his diuell, he bloweth vpon the part grieued, he maketh inci&s;ions, &s;ucketh the bad bloud from it: if it be a wound he healeth it by the &s;ame meanes, applying a round &s;lice of the Bea|uers &s;tones. Finally, &s;ome pre&s;ent is made vnto him, ei|ther of veni&s;on or skinnes. If it be que&s;tion to haue newes of things ab&s;ent, hauing fir&s;t que&s;tioned with his &s;pirit, he rendreth his oracles commonly doubtfull, very often fal&s;e, but &s;ometimes true: as when he was asked whether <HI>Pano|niac</HI> were dead, he &s;aid, that vnle&s;&s;e he did returne within fifteene daies, they &s;hould not expect him any more, and that he was killed by the <HI>Armouchiquois.</HI> And for to haue

this an&s;wer he mu&s;t be pre&s;ented with &s;ome gift. For there is a triuiall prouerbe among the Greekes, which beareth, That without mony Phoebus Oracles are dumbe. The &s;ame <HI>Membertou</HI> rendered a true Oracle of our comming to <HI>Mon&s;ieur du Pont,</HI> when that he parted from Port Roy|all, &s;or to returne into France, &s;eeing the 15. daie of Iuly pa&s;&s;ed without hauing any newes. For he did maintaine &s;till, and did affirme that there &s;hould come a &s;hip, and that his diuell had told it him. Item when the Sauages be a hun|gred they con&s;ult with <HI>Membertous</HI> Oracle, and he &s;aith vnto them, Go yee to &s;uch a place &amp; you &s;hal finde game. It happeneth &s;ometimes that they finde &s;ome, and &s;ome|times none. If it chance that none be found, the excu&s;e is, that the bea&s;t is wandering and hath changed place: but &s;o it comes to pa&s;&s;e, that very often they finde &s;ome: And this is it which makes them beleeue that this diuell is a god, and they know none other, to whom notwith&s;tand|ing they yeeld not any &s;eruice nor adoration in any forme of religion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How the <HI>Aoutmoins</HI> inuocate the Diuell.</NOTE> When that the&s;e <HI>Aoutmoins</HI> make their mowes and moppes, they fix a &s;taffe in a pit, to which they tie a cord, and putting their head into this pit, they make inuocations or coniurations in a language vnknowen to the others that are about, and this with beatings and howlings, vntill they &s;weat with very paine: yet I haue not heard that they &s;ome at the mouth as the Turkes doe. When this diuell is come, this ma&s;ter <HI>Aoutmoin</HI> makes them beleeue that he holdeth him tied by his cord, and holdeth fa&s;t again&s;t him, forcing him to giue him an an&s;wer before he let him goe. By this is knowen the &s;ubtilty of this enemy of nature, who begui|leth thus the&s;e mi&s;erable creatures, and his pride withall, in willing that they which doe call vpon him, yeeld vnto him more &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion then euer the holy Patriarches and Prophets haue done to God, who haue onely praied with their faces towards the ground. <NOTE PLACE="marg">A &s;ong to the prai&s;e of the Divell.</NOTE></P>
<P>That done he beginneth to &s;ing &s;ome thing (as I thinke)

to the prai&s;e of the diuell, who hath di&s;couered &s;ome game vnto them: and the other Sauages that are there doe an|&s;wer, making &s;ome concordance of mu&s;icke among them. Then they dance after their maner, as we will heereafter &s;ay, with &s;ongs which I vnder&s;tand not, neither tho&s;e of ours that vnder&s;tood their &s;peech be&s;t. But one day go|ing to walke in our Medowes along the riuer, I drew neere to <HI>Membertous</HI> cabine, and did write in my table booke part of that which I vnder&s;tood, which is written there yet in the&s;e termes; <HI>haloet ho ho h&eacute; he ha ha haloet ho ho h&eacute;,</HI> which they did repeat diuers times. The tune is in my &s;aid table booke in the&s;e notes: <HI>re fa &s;ol &s;ol re &s;ol &s;ol fa fa re re &s;ol &s;ol fa fa.</HI> One &s;ong being ended, they all made a great ex|clamation, &s;aying <HI>E!</HI> Then began againe another &s;ong, &s;aying: <HI>Egrigna hau egrigna he he hu hu ho ho egrigna hau hau hau.</HI> The tune of this was, <HI>fa fa fa &s;ol &s;ol fa fa re re &s;ol &s;ol fa fa re fa fa &s;ol &s;ol fa.</HI> Hauing made the v&s;uall exclamation they began yet another &s;ong which was: <HI>Tameia alleluia tameia dou veni hau hau h&eacute; h&eacute;.</HI> The tune whereof was: <HI>&s;ol &s;ol&s;olfafarererefafa&s;olfa&s;olfafarere.</HI> I attentiuely hark|ned vpon this word <HI>alleluia</HI> repeated &s;undry times, and could neuer heare any other thing. Which maketh mee thinke that the&s;e &s;ongs are to the prai&s;es of the diuel, if not|with&s;tanding this word &s;ignifie with them that which it &s;ignifieth in Hebrew, which is, <HI>Prai&s;e ye the Lord.</HI> All the other Nations of tho&s;e Countries doe the like: but no bo|dy hath particularily de&s;cribed their &s;ongs, &s;auing <HI>Iohn de Leri,</HI> who &s;aith that the <HI>Bra&s;ilians</HI> doe make as good agree|ments, in their Sabbaths.

Likewi&s;e that they had, with all ve|hemency, threatned the <HI>Ouetacas</HI> their enemies to be in ve|ry &s;hort time taken and eaten by them, according as the <HI>Caraibes</HI> had promi&s;ed them: and that they had al&s;o made mention of the floud &s;poken of in the former chapter. I leaue vnto them that doe write of <HI>Demonomanie</HI> to philo&s;o|phize vpon that matter. But moreouer, I mu&s;t &s;ay that while&s;t our Sauages do &s;ing in that maner before &s;aid, there be &s;ome others which doe nothing el&s;e but &s;ay <HI>He</HI> or <HI>Het</HI> (like to a man that cleaueth wood) with a certaine motion <NOTE PLACE="marg">The daunces of the Saua|ges.</NOTE>of the armes: and daunce in round, not holding one ano|ther, nor moouing out of one place, &s;triking with their feet again&s;t the ground, which is the forme of their daunces, like vnto tho&s;e which the &s;aid <HI>De Leri</HI> reporteth of them of <HI>Bra&s;ill,</HI> which are aboue 1500. leagues from that place.

Be&s;ides all this, they put halfe a pole out of the top of the Cabin where they are, at the end whereof there is &s;ome <HI>Matachias,</HI> or &s;ome thing el&s;e tied, which the diuell cari|eth away.

<P>The <HI>Bra&s;ilians</HI> haue their <HI>Caraibes,</HI> who trauell thorow the villages, making the people beleeue that they haue communication with &s;pirits, through who&s;e meanes they can, not onely giue them victory again&s;t their enemies, but al&s;o, that of them depends the fertility or &s;terility of the ground. They haue commonly a certaine kinde of belles or rattles in their hands, which they call <HI>Maraca,</HI> made with the fruit of a tree, as bigge as an E&s;triches egge, which they make hollow, as they doe heere the bottels of the Pilgrims that goe to Saint Iames: And hauing filled <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tho&s;e bot|tles, or ratties are made of Pompions.</NOTE>them with &s;mall &s;tones, they make a noi&s;e with them, in their &s;olemnities, like the bladders of hogges: and going from towne to towne they beguile the world, telling the people that their diuell is within the &s;ame.

The hats that be made of it are in v&s;e but &s;ince that time: not that the inuention thereof is new: for in the ancient orders <NOTE PLACE="marg">Beuer-hats.</NOTE>of the Hat-makers of Paris, it is &s;aid that they &s;hall make

hats of fine Beuers (which is the Ca&s;tor) but whether it be for the dearene&s;&s;e, or otherwi&s;e, the v&s;e thereof hath beene long &s;ince left off.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the pro|nounciation.</NOTE> As for the Pronounciation, our <HI>Souriquois</HI> haue the Greeke (&ougr;) which we call <HI>(v),</HI> and their words doe com|monly end in <HI>(a)</HI> as <HI>Souriquois, Souriquoa: Captaine, Ca|pitaina: Normand, Normandia: Ba&s;que, Ba&s;quoa: vne Martre</HI> (a Marten) <HI>Martra:</HI> a banquet, <HI>Tabaguia:</HI> &amp;c.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of their clothing and wearing of their haires.</HEAD>
<P>GOd in the beginning did create man naked, and in|nocent, made all the parts of his body to bee of ho|ne&s;t &s;ight. But &s;in hath made the members of gene|ration to become &s;hamefull vnto vs, and not vnto bea&s;ts which haue no &s;inne. It is the cau&s;e why our fir&s;t parents
<PB N="175" REF="99">
hauing knowen their nakedne&s;&s;e, de&s;titute of clothes, did <NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen&s;. 3.</NOTE>&s;ow figge leaues together for to hide their &s;hame there|with: But God made vnto them coates of skinnes, and clothed them with it; and this before they went out of the garde~ of <HI>Eden.</HI> Clothing then is not only to defend vs from cold, but al&s;o for decencie, and to couer our &s;hame. And neuerthele&s;&s;e many nations haue anciently liued, and at this day doe liue naked, without apprehen&s;ion of this &s;hame, decencie, and hone&s;tie. And I maruell not of the <HI>Bra&s;ilien</HI> Sauages that are &s;uch, as well men as women, nor of the ancient Picts (a nation of great Britaine) who <HI>(He|rodian</HI> &s;aith) had not any v&s;e of clothes, in the time of <HI>Se|uerus</HI> the Emperour: nor of a great number of other na|tions that haue beene and yet are naked: for one may &s;ay of them, that they be people fallen into a reprobate &s;en&s;e, and for&s;aken of God: But of Chri&s;tians which are in <HI>Aethiopia</HI> vnder the great <HI>Negus,</HI> whom we call <HI>Pre&s;ter-Ihon;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Nakedne&s;&s;e of the Aethio|pians.</NOTE>which, by the report of the Portingals that haue wri|ten hi&s;tories of them, haue not their parts which wee call priuie members, any waies couered. But the Sauages of New France and of <HI>Florida,</HI> haue better learned and kept in minde the le&s;&s;on of hone&s;tie, than tho&s;e of <HI>Aethiopia.</HI> For they couer them with a skinne tied to a latch or gir|dle of leather, which pa&s;&s;ing between their buttocks, ioin|eth the other end of the &s;aid latch behind. And for the re&s;t of their garments, they haue a cloake on their backs, made with many skinnes, whether they be of Otters or of Bea|uers: and one only skin, whether it be of <HI>Ellan,</HI> or Stagges skinne, Beare, or Lu&s;erne, which cloake is tied vpward with a leather riband, and they thru&s;t commonly one arme out, but being in their cabins, they put it off, vn|le&s;&s;e it be cold: And I cannot better compare it than to pictures that are made of <HI>Hercules,</HI> who killed a lion and put the skinne thereof on his backe. Notwith&s;tanding they haue more ciuilitie, in that they couer their priuie <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Wo|men.</NOTE>members. As for the women, they differ onely in one
<PB N="176" REF="100">
thing, that is, they haue a girdle ouer the skin they haue on: and doe re&s;emble (without compari&s;on) the pictures that be made of Saint Iohn Bapti&s;t. But in Winter they make good Beuer &s;leeues, tied behind, which keepe them very warme. And after this maner were the ancient Ger|mans clothed, by the report of <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> and <HI>Tacitus,</HI> hauing the mo&s;t part of the body naked.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Armouchiquois</HI> and <HI>Floridians</HI> they haue no furres, but onely &s;hamois: yea the &s;aid <HI>Armouchiquois</HI> haue very often but a peece of matte vpon their backe, for fa&s;hions &s;ake, hauing neuerthele&s;&s;e their priuie mem|bers <NOTE PLACE="marg">Gods proui|dence.</NOTE>couered. God hauing &s;o wi&s;ely prouided for mans infirmitie, that in cold countries he hath giuen furres, and not in the hot, becau&s;e that otherwi&s;e men would make no e&s;teeme of them. And &s;o for that which concerneth the body. Let vs come to the legges and feet, then we will end with the head.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Ho&s;ing.</NOTE> Our Sauages in the Winter, going to &s;ea, or a hunting, doe v&s;e great and high &s;tockings, like to our boote-ho&s;en, which they tie to their girdles, and at the &s;ides outward, there is a great number of points without tagges. I doe not &s;ee that they of <HI>Bra&s;il</HI> or <HI>Florida,</HI> doe v&s;e of them, but &s;ee|ing they haue leather, they may as well make of them, if they haue need as the others.

<P>AMong&s;t all the formes of liuing and bodily crea|tures, that of man is the faire&s;t and the mo&s;t per|fect. Which was very decent, both to the creature and to the Creator, &s;eeing that man is placed in this world to command all that is heere beneath. But although that Nature indeuoureth her&s;elfe alwaies to doe good, not|with&s;tanding &s;hee is &s;ometimes &s;hort and forced in her actions, and thereof it commeth that we haue mon&s;ters and vgly things, contrary to the ordinary rule of others. Yea euen &s;ometimes after that nature hath done her office, we helpe by our artes to render that which &s;he hath made, rediculous and mi&s;shapen: As for example, the <HI>Bra&s;ilians</HI> are borne as faire as the common &s;ort of men, but comming out of the wombe, they are made deformed in &s;quizing of their no&s;e, which is the chiefe&s;t part wherein con&s;i&s;teth the beauty of man. True it is that as in certaine Countries
<PB N="180" REF="102">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bra&s;ili|ans be &s;hort no&s;ed.</NOTE> they prai&s;e the long no&s;es, in others the hawke no&s;es, &s;o a|mong the <HI>Bra&s;ilians</HI> it is a faire thing to be flat no&s;ed, as al|&s;o among the Moores of <HI>Africa,</HI> which we &s;ee to be all of the &s;ame &s;ort. And with the&s;e large no&s;trils, the <HI>Bra&s;ilians</HI> are accu&s;tomed to make them&s;elues yet more deformed by Art, making great holes in their cheekes, and vnder the lower lippe, for to put therein greene &s;tones and of other colours, of the bigne&s;&s;e of a te&s;ter: &s;o that tho&s;e &s;tones be|ing taken away, it is a hideous thing to &s;ee tho&s;e people. But in <HI>Florida,</HI> and euery where, on this &s;ide the <HI>Tropique</HI> of <HI>Cancer,</HI> our Sauages be generally goodly men, as they be in Europe: if there be any &s;hort no&s;ed one it is a rare thing. They be of a good &s;tature, and I haue &s;eene no dwarffes there, nor any that drew neere to it. Notwith|&s;tanding (as I haue &s;aid el&s;ewhere) in the Mountaines of the <HI>Iroquois,</HI> which are beyond the great fall of the great riuer of <HI>Canada,</HI> there is a certaine Nation of Sauages, little men, valiant and feared euery where, which are more often a&s;|&s;ailers than defenders. But although that where we dwelt the men be of a good height, neuerthele&s;&s;e I haue &s;een none &s;o tall as <HI>Mon&s;ieur De Poutrincourt,</HI> who&s;e talene&s;&s;e be|commeth him very well. I will not &s;peake heere of the <HI>Patagons,</HI> a people which is beyond the riuer of <HI>Plate,</HI> whom <HI>Pighafetta</HI> in his voyage about the world, &s;aith to be of &s;uch an height, that the tale&s;t among vs could &s;car&s;e reach to their girdle. The &s;ame is out of the limits of our New France. But I will willingly come to the other cir|cum&s;tances of body of our Sauages, &s;eeing the &s;ubiect cal|leth vs thereunto.</P>
<P>They are all of an Oliue colour, or rather tawny colour, like to the Spaniards, not that they be &s;o borne, but being the mo&s;t part of the time naked, they grea&s;e their bodies, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>The colour of the Saua|ges.</P>

<PB N="181" REF="102">
prince of flies hath there a great Empire. The&s;e flies are <NOTE PLACE="marg">The di&s;cripti|on of the flies of New France.</NOTE>of a colour drawing towards red, as of corrupted bloud, which maketh me to beleeue that their generation com|meth but from the rottenne&s;&s;e of woods. And indeed we haue tried that the &s;econd yeare, being in a place &s;omwhat more open, wee haue had fewer of them than at the fir&s;t. They cannot endure great heat, nor winde: but other|wi&s;e (as in clo&s;e darke weather) they are very noy&s;ome, by rea&s;on of their &s;tings, which they haue, long for &s;o &s;mall a body: &amp; they be &s;o tender that if one touch them neuer &s;o little they are &s;qui&s;ed. They begin to come about the 15. <NOTE PLACE="marg">When the flies come in and when they goe out.</NOTE>of Iune, and doe retire them&s;elues in the beginning of Sep|tember. Being in the Port <HI>De Camp&s;eau</HI> in the moneth of Augu&s;t I haue not &s;eene nor felt any one; whereof I did wonder, &s;eeing that the nature of the &s;oile and of the woods is all one. In September, after that this vermine is gone away, there grow other flies like vnto ours, but they are not trouble&s;ome, and become very bigge. Now our Sa|uages <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sauages remodies a|gain&s;t the flies.</NOTE>to &s;aue them&s;elues from the &s;tinging of the&s;e crea|tures, rubbe them&s;elues with certaine grea&s;es and oiles, as I haue &s;aid, which make them foule and of a tawni&s;h colour. Be&s;ides that alwaies they lie on the ground, or be expo&s;ed to the heat and the wind.</P>
<P>But there is cau&s;e of wondering, wherefore the <HI>Bra&s;ili|ans,</HI> and other inhabitants of <HI>America</HI> betweene the two <HI>Tropikes,</HI> are not borne blacke as they of <HI>Africa,</HI> &s;eeing that it &s;eemeth it is the &s;elfe&s;ame ca&s;e, being vnder one and the &s;elfe&s;ame parallell and like eleuation of the Sunne. If the Poets fables were &s;ufficient rea&s;ons for to take away this &s;cruple, one might &s;ay that <HI>Phaeton</HI> hauing done the foo|li&s;h deed in conducting the Charet of the Sunne, onely <HI>Africa</HI> was burned, and the hor&s;es &s;et againe in their right cour&s;e, before they came to the New world. But I had ra|ther <NOTE PLACE="marg">From whence commeth the burning of <HI>Africa.</HI></NOTE>&s;ay, that the heat of <HI>Lybia,</HI> being the cau&s;e of this blackne&s;&s;e of men, is ingendred from the great lands ouer which the Sunne pa&s;&s;eth before it come thither, from
<PB N="182" REF="103">
whence the heat is &s;till carried more abundantly by the &s;wift motion of this great Heauenly torch. Whereunto the great &s;ands of that Prouince doe al&s;o helpe, which are very capable of tho&s;e heates, &s;pecially not being watered <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fro~ whence proceedeth the cooling of America.</NOTE>with &s;tore of riuers, as <HI>America</HI> is, which aboundeth in ri|uers and brookes as much as any Prouince in the World: which doe giue perpetuall refre&s;hing vnto it, and makes the region much more temperate: the ground being al&s;o there more fat, and retaining better the dewes of Heauen, which are there abundantly, and raines al&s;o, for the rea|&s;ons abue&s;aid. For the Sunne finding in the meeting of the&s;e lands tho&s;e great moi&s;tne&s;&s;es, he doth not faile to draw a good quantitie of them, and that &s;o much the more plentifully, that his force is there great and maruel|lous: which makes there continuall raines, e&s;pecially to them that haue him for their zenith. I adde one great rea|&s;on, that the Sunne leauing the lands of <HI>Africa,</HI> giueth his beames vpon a moi&s;t element by &s;o long a cour&s;e, that he hath good meanes to &s;ucke vp vapors, and to draw toge|ther with him great quantitie thereof into tho&s;e parts: which maketh that the cau&s;e is much differing of the co|lour of the&s;e two people, and of the temperature of their lands.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Black haires.</NOTE> Let vs come to other circum&s;tances, and &s;eeing that we are about colours, I will &s;ay, that all they which I haue &s;eene haue blacke haires, &s;ome excepted which haue a|bram colour haires: but of flaxen colour I haue &s;eene none, and le&s;&s;e of red: and one mu&s;t not thinke that they which are more Southerly be otherwi&s;e: for the <HI>Floridi|ans</HI> and <HI>Bra&s;ilians</HI> are yet blacker than the Sauages of New found land. The beard of the chinne (which our Sauages call <HI>migidoni)</HI> is with them as blacke as their haires. They all take away the producing cau&s;e thereof, except the <HI>Sa|gamos,</HI> who for the mo&s;t part haue but a little. <HI>Membertou</HI> hath more than all the others, and notwith&s;tanding it is not thicke, as it is commonly with Frenchmen. If the&s;e
<PB N="183" REF="103">
people weare no beards on their chinne (at the lea&s;t the mo&s;t part) there is no cau&s;e of maruelling. For the ancient Romans them&s;elues, e&s;teeming that that was a hinderance vnto them, did weare none, vntill the time of <HI>Adrian</HI> the Emperour, who fir&s;t began to weare a beard. Which they tooke for &s;uch an honour, that a man accu&s;ed of any crime, had not that priuiledge to &s;haue his haires, as may be gathered by the te&s;timonie of <HI>Aulus Gellius,</HI> &s;peaking <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. Gel. li. <HI>3 c. 4.</HI></NOTE>of <HI>Scipio,</HI> the &s;onne of <HI>Paul.</HI> As for the inferiour parts, our Sauages doe not hinder the growing or increa&s;ing of haires there. It is &s;aid that the women haue &s;ome there al|&s;o. And according as they be curious, &s;ome of our men haue made them beleeue, that the French women haue beards on their chinnes, and haue left them in that good opinion, &s;o that they were very de&s;irious to &s;ee &s;ome of them, &amp; their maner of clothing. By the&s;e particularities one may vnder&s;tand, that all the&s;e people haue generally le&s;&s;er haires than we: for along the body they haue none at all: &s;o farre is it then that they be hairie as &s;ome thinke. This belongeth to the inhabitants of the Iles <HI>Gorgades,</HI> from whence <HI>Hanno</HI> the Carthaginien captaine brought two womens skinnes, which he did &s;et vp in the temple of <HI>Iuno</HI> for great &s;ingularitie: But heere is to bee noted what we haue &s;aid, that our &s;auage people haue almo&s;t all their haires blacke: for the Frenchmen in one and the &s;elfe&s;ame degree are not commonly &s;o. The ancient au|thors <NOTE PLACE="marg">The corpo|rall qualities of the anci|ent Gaullois.</NOTE><HI>Polybius, Cae&s;ar, Strabo, Diadore</HI> the Cicilian, and particularly <HI>Ammian Marcellin,</HI> doe &s;ay, that the anci|ent <HI>Gaullois</HI> had almo&s;t all their haires as yellow as gold, were of high &s;tature, and fearefull for their ga&s;tly lookes: be&s;ides quarel&s;ome and readie to &s;trike: a fearefull voice, neuer &s;peaking but in threatning. At this time tho&s;e qua|lities are well changed. For there are not now &s;o many yellow haires: nor &s;o many men of high &s;tature, but that other nations haue as tall: As for the fearefull lookes, the delicacies of this time haue moderated that: and as for
<PB N="184" REF="104">
the threatning voice, I haue &s;car&s;e &s;eene in all the <HI>Gaules</HI> but the Ga&s;cons, and them of Languedoc, which haue their maner of &s;peech &s;ome what rude, which they retaine of the Goti&s;h and of the Spaniard, by their neighbour|hood. But as for the haires it is very farre from being &s;o commonly blacke. The &s;ame author <HI>Ammian</HI> &s;aith al&s;o, that the women of the <HI>Gaules</HI> (whom he noted to be good &s;hrewes, and to bee too hard for their husbands, when they are in choler) haue blue eies: and con&s;equently the men: and notwith&s;tanding in that re&s;pect wee are much mingled: which maketh that one knoweth not what <NOTE PLACE="marg">The beauty of the eies.</NOTE>rarene&s;&s;e to chu&s;e for the beautie of eies. For many doe loue the blue eies, and others loue them greene: which were al&s;o in ancient time mo&s;t prai&s;ed. For among the Sonnets of <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Couci,</HI> (who was in old time &s;o great a clerke in loue matters, that &s;ongs were made of it) greene eies are prai&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Germans haue kept better than we the qualities which <HI>Tacitus</HI> giueth them, likewi&s;e that which <HI>Ammian</HI> reciteth of the <HI>Gaullois:</HI> In &s;o great a number of men (&s;aith <HI>Tacitus)</HI> there is but one fa&s;hion of garments: They haue blue eies and fearefull, their haires &s;hining as gold, and are very corpulent. <HI>Pliny</HI> giueth the &s;ame bodily qualities to the people of the <HI>Taprobane,</HI> &s;aying that they haue redde haires, their eies blue, and the voice horrible and feare|full. Wherein I know not if I ought to beleeue him, con|&s;idering the climate, which is in the 8, 9. and 10. degrees onely, and that in the kingdome of <HI>Calecute,</HI> farther off than the <HI>Aequinoctial</HI> line, the men are blacke. But as for our Sauages, concerning their eies, they haue them neither blue nor greene, but blacke for the mo&s;t part, like to their haires: and neuerthele&s;&s;e their eies are not &s;mall, as they of the ancient <HI>Scythians,</HI> but of a decent greatne&s;&s;e. And I may &s;ay a&s;&s;uredly and truely, that I haue &s;eene there as faire boies and girles, as any can be in France. For as for the mouth, they haue no bigge moori&s;h lippes, as in <HI>Afri|ca,</HI>

In the vallies the aire is gro&s;|&s;er, and the lands fatter, and con&s;equently vnhole&s;ommer. The nations that be between the <HI>Tropikes,</HI> haue al&s;o more agilitie than the others, participating more with the firie nature than they that are farther off.

in &s;uch maner, that <HI>Hanno</HI> the Carthaginian could not catch any one of them.

And <HI>Maffeus</HI> in his Hi&s;tories of the Indies re|porteth, that the <HI>Naires</HI> (&s;o the nobles and warriours are called) of the kingdome of <HI>Malabaris,</HI> are &s;o nimble and &s;o &s;wift, as it is almo&s;t incredible, and doe handle &s;o well their bodies at will, that they &s;eeme to haue no bones, in &s;uch &s;ort, that it is hard to come to skirmi&s;h again&s;t &s;uch men, fora&s;much as with this agilitie, they aduance and re|coile as they li&s;t.

For the holy Scripture maketh mention of one <HI>Hazael</HI> an I&s;raelite, of whom it witne&s;&s;eth, that he was as light of foot as a Roe bucke of the fields. And for to come to the people of the North, the <HI>Heruli</HI> are renouned for being &s;wift in runing, by this ver&s;e of <HI>Sidonius:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cur&s;u Herulus, iaculis Hunnus, Francu&s;que natatu.</HI> And by this &s;wiftne&s;&s;e the Germans &s;ometimes troubled very much <HI>Iulius Cae&s;ar.</HI> So our <HI>Armouchiquois</HI> are as &s;wift as grey hounds, as we haue &s;aid heertofore, and the other Sauages are little inferior vnto them, and yet they do not force nature, neither doe they v&s;e any Art to run well. But as the ancient <HI>Gaulois,</HI> being addicted to hunting (for
<PB N="187" REF="105">
it is their life) and to warre, their bodies are nimble, and &s;o little charged with fatte, that it doth not hinder them from running at their will.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their dexte|ritie in &s;wim|ing.</NOTE> Now the Sauages dexteritie is not knowen onely by running, but al&s;o in &s;wimming; which they all can doe: but it &s;eemes, that &s;ome more than others. As for the <HI>Bra|&s;ilians</HI> they are &s;o naturall in that trade, that they would &s;wimme eight daies in the &s;ea, if hunger did not pre&s;&s;e them, and they feare more that &s;ome fi&s;h &s;hould deuoure them, than to peri&s;h through wearine&s;&s;e.

The women likewi&s;e haue a maruellous di&s;po&s;ition to that exerci&s;e: for the Hi|&s;tory of <HI>Florida</HI> maketh mention that they can pa&s;&s;e great riuers in &s;wimming, holding their children with one arme: and they climbe very nimbly vp the highe&s;t trees of the countrey. I will affirme nothing of the <HI>Armouchi|quois,</HI> nor of our Sauages, becau&s;e I tooke no heed to it: but it is very certaine that all can &s;wim very cunningly. For the other parts of their bodies they haue them verie perfect, as likewi&s;e the naturall &s;en&s;es. For <HI>Membertou</HI> (who is aboue an hundred yeeres old) did &s;ee &s;ooner a &s;haloupe or a Canow of the Sauages, to come afarre off vnto Port Royall, than any of vs: and it is &s;aid of the <HI>Bra|&s;ilians</HI> and other Sauages of <HI>Peru</HI> hidden in the moun|taines, that they haue the &s;melling &s;o good, that in &s;mel|ling of the hand, they know if a man be a Spaniard or a French man: And if he be a Spaniard, they kill him with|out remi&s;&s;ion, &s;o much doe they hate him for the harmes that they haue receiued of them.

<P>The Spani&s;h women in <HI>Peru</HI> do go beyond that, for their &s;hooes are &s;et ouer with nothing but plates of gold and &s;iluer, and garni&s;hed with pearles.

But if thou ha&s;t not &s;o much of them, do not vex thy &s;elfe at it, &amp; be not tempted through enuy: &s;uch things are but earth, digged and purified with a thou&s;and troubles, in the bottome of hell, by the incre|dible labor, &amp; with the life of men like vnto thee: Pearles are but dew, receaued within the &s;hell of a fi&s;h, which are <NOTE PLACE="marg">Pearles what they be.</NOTE>fi&s;hed by men that be forced to become fi&s;hes, that is to &s;ay, to be alwaies diuing in the depth of the &s;ea.

And where tho&s;e things doe abound, there delights doe abound, and con&s;equent|ly vices: and to conclude, behold what God &s;aith by his Prophet: <HI>They &s;hall ca&s;t their &s;iluer out into the &s;treetes, and their gold &s;hall be but dung, and &s;hall not deliuer them in the</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezec. 7. 19.</NOTE><HI>day of my great wrath.</HI> Hee that will haue further know|ledge of the cha&s;ti&s;ements wherewith God doth threaten the woman that abu&s;e carkenets and iewels, which haue no other care but to attire and decke them&s;elues, goe with their brea&s;ts open, their eies wandring, and with a proud gate, let him reade the third chapter of the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah.</HI> I will not for all that blame the Virgins which haue &s;ome golden things, or chaines of pearles, or other iewels, al&s;o &s;ome mode&s;t ve&s;ture: for that is comline&s;&s;e, and all things are made for the v&s;e of man: but exce&s;&s;e is that which is to be blamed, becau&s;e that vnder that, very

The <HI>Bra&s;ilians, Floridians,</HI> and <HI>Armouchiquois,</HI> doe make carkenets and bracelets (called <HI>bou-re in Bra&s;ill,</HI> and by ours <HI>Matachias)</HI> of the &s;helles of tho&s;e great &s;ea cockles, which be called <HI>Vignols,</HI> like vnto &s;nailes, which they break &amp; gather vp in a thou&s;and pee|ces, then doe &s;mooth them vpon a hot &s;tone, vntill they do make them very &s;mall, and hauing pierced them, they make them beads with them, like vnto that which wee call <HI>Pourcelaine.</HI> Among tho&s;e beads they intermingle be|tweene &s;paces other beads, as blacke as tho&s;e which I <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iet.</NOTE>haue &s;poken of to be white, made with Iet, or certain hard and black wood which is like vnto it, which they &s;mooth and make &s;mall as they li&s;t, and this hath a very good grace. And if things are to be e&s;teemed for their fa&s;hion, as we &s;ee it practi&s;ed in our merchandi&s;es, the&s;e colars, skarffes, and bracelets made of great periwincles or pour|celaine, are richer than pearles, (notwith&s;tanding none will beleeue me heerein) &s;o doe they e&s;teeme them more than pearles, gold or &s;iluer: And this is that which they of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Beades much e&s;teemed.</NOTE>the great riuer of <HI>Canada</HI> in the time of <HI>Iam.

women doe decke them&s;elues with &s;uch things, and will haue chaines that will goe twelue times about their necks, hanging downe vpon their bre&s;ts, and about their hand wre&s;ts, and aboue the elbow. They al&s;o hang long &s;trings of them at their eares, which come downe as low as their &s;houlders. If the men weare any, it will bee onely &s;ome yong man that is in loue. In the country of <HI>Virginia</HI> where <NOTE PLACE="marg">Pearles in Virginia.

But in Port Roy|all, and in the confines thereof, and towards New-found land, and at <HI>Tadou&s;&s;ac,</HI> where they haue neither pearles nor vignols, the maides and women doe make <HI>Mattachi|as,</HI> with the quilles or bri&s;tles of the <HI>Porc-epine,</HI> which they die with blacke, white, and red colours, as liuely as po&s;&s;ibly may be, for our skarlets haue no better lu&s;tre <NOTE PLACE="marg">Excellent skarlet die.</NOTE>than their redde die: But they more e&s;teeme the <HI>Matta|chias</HI> which come vnto them from the <HI>Armouchiquois</HI> countrey, and they buy them very deare; and that be|cau&s;e they can get no great quantitie of them, by rea&s;on of the warres that tho&s;e nations haue continually one a|gain&s;t another.

<P>This fir&s;t and chiefe&s;t article being mentioned, let vs come to the others. Our Sauage women after they haue brought foorth the fruite of this exerci&s;e, by I know not what practi&s;e, doe ob&s;erue without law that which was <NOTE PLACE="marg">Leuit. 12. purification.</NOTE>commanded in the lawe of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> touching purifica|tion.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Heere aboue chap. 14.</NOTE> I haue &s;aid in the chapter of the <HI>Tabagie</HI> that among the Sauages, the women are not in as good a condition as they were anciently among the <HI>Gaullois</HI> and <HI>Germans.</HI> For (by the report of <HI>Iames Quartier</HI> him&s;elfe) they labour more then the men, &s;aith he, whether it be in fi&s;hing, be it in til|ling or in any thing el&s;e. And notwith&s;tanding they are neither forced, nor tormented: but they are neither in their <HI>Tabagies</HI> nor in their coun&s;els, and doe the &s;eruile bu&s;ine&s;|&s;es, for want of &s;eruants. If there be any veni&s;on killed, they goe to flay it and to fetch it, yea were it three leagues off: and they mu&s;t finde it out by the onely circum&s;tance that &s;hall be de&s;cribed to them by words. They that haue pri&s;oners doe al&s;o employ them to that, and to other la|bours, as to goe fetch wood with wiues: which is folly in them to goe fetch drie and rotten wood very farre
<PB N="237" REF="130">
off for to warme them, although they be in the midde&s;t of a forre&s;t. True it is that the &s;moake is very irke&s;ome to them: which it may be is the cau&s;e thereof.</P>
<P>Touching their &s;maller exerci&s;es; when the winter doth approch they prepare that which is nece&s;&s;ary to oppo&s;e them&s;elues again&s;t this rigorous aduer&s;ary, and make mattes of ru&s;hes, wherewith they garni&s;h their Ca|bins, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mattes.</NOTE>and others to fit vpon, and all very artificially, yea al&s;o colouring their ru&s;hes, they make partitions in their workes, like to them that our gardeners doe make in their garden knots, with &s;uch mea&s;ure and proportion as no|thing is found ami&s;&s;e therein.

If they be little they few many together, and make cloakes, &s;leeues, &s;tockens, and &s;hooes, vpon all which things they make workes which haue a very good grace. Item they <NOTE PLACE="marg">Panniers.</NOTE>make Panniers of ru&s;hes and rootes, for to put their nece&s;|&s;ities in, as corne, beanes, pea&s;on, fle&s;h, fi&s;h and other things.

all their labours, yet commonly they loue their <NOTE PLACE="marg">The womens loue to their husbands.</NOTE>husbands more then the women of the&s;e our parts.

<P>THe warre being ended, humanity doth inuite vs to bewaile for the dead, and to bury them. It is a worke wholy of pietie, and more meritorious then any other.

This le&s;&s;on being come, whether it be by &s;ome traditi|on, or by the in&s;tinct of nature, as farre as to our Sauages, they haue yet at this day that common with the nations of the&s;e parts to weepe for the dead, and to keepe the bo|dies of them after their decea&s;e, as it was done in the time of the holy Patriarches Abraham, I&s;aac, and Iacob, and &s;ince.

Of what kinde this balme is, I could not know, not being able to enquire of it vpon the places. I be|leeue they iagge the dead corp&s;es and make them to dry. Certaine it is that they pre&s;erue them from rottenne&s;&s;e: which thing they doe almo&s;t throughout all the&s;e Indies.

<P>It is a thing well knowen that the ancient <HI>Aegyptians</HI> did enbalme the dead bodies, and kept them carefully.

From the Riuer of Saint Croix the &s;aid decea&s;&s;ed <HI>Pano|niac</HI> was brought into Port Royall, where againe he was wept for.

<P>It is a thing woorthy maruelling that nations &s;o far di|&s;tant doe agree in tho&s;e ceremonies with many of the he|ther world.

<P>The old <HI>Gaullois</HI> and <HI>Germains</HI> did burne with the dead bodie all that which he had loued, euen to the very bea&s;ts, papers of accounts and obligations, as if by that meanes they would either haue paied, or demanded their <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> in the 6. booke of the warre of the <HI>Gaullois.</HI></NOTE>debts. In &s;uch &s;ort, that a little before that <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> came thither, there was &s;ome that did ca&s;t them&s;elues vpon the pile where the body was burned, in hope to liue el&s;e where with their kinred, Lords, and friends.

<P>The&s;e fa&s;hions haue beene common anciently to many nations, but our Sauages are not &s;o fooli&s;h as that: for they take good heede from putting them&s;elues into the fire, knowing that it is to hot. They content them&s;elues then in burning the dead man his goods: And as for the body they put him honourably in the graue. This <HI>Pano|niac</HI> of whom wee haue &s;poken was kept in the cabin of <HI>Niguiroet,</HI> his father, and of <HI>Neguioadetch,</HI> his mother, vn|till the Spring time, when that the a&s;&s;embly of the Saua|ges

Tho&s;e I&s;les which doe &s;erue them for Church-yardes are &s;ecret among&s;t them, for feare &s;ome enemy &s;hould &s;eeke to torment the bones of their dead.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Plin. l.</HI> 7. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">. 56.</NOTE> <HI>Pliny,</HI> and many others, haue e&s;teemed that it was foo|li&s;hne&s;&s;e to keepe dead bodies vnder a vaine opinion that after this life one is &s;omething. But one may apply vn|to him that which <HI>Portius Fe&s;tus</HI> Gouernour of <HI>Cae&s;area</HI> did fooli&s;hly &s;ay to the Apo&s;tle <HI>Saint Paul: Thou art be|&s;ides</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 26. v. 34.</NOTE><HI>thy &s;elfe: much learning hath made thee mad.</HI> Our Sa|uages are e&s;teemed very bruti&s;h (which they are not) but yet they haue more wi&s;edome in that re&s;pect then &s;uch Philo&s;ophers.</P>
<P>We Chri&s;tians doe commonly bury the dead bodies, that is to &s;ay, we yeeld them to the earth (called <HI>Humus,</HI> from whence commeth the word <HI>Homo a Man)</HI> from which they were taken, and &s;o did the ancient Romans before the cu&s;tome of burning them. Which among&s;t the We&s;t Indians the Bra&s;ilians doe, who put their dead into pits digged after the forme of a tunne, almo&s;t vp|right, &s;ometimes in their owne hou&s;es, like to the fir&s;t Ro|mans, according as <HI>Seruius</HI> the Commentor of <HI>Virgill</HI> doth &s;ay. But our &s;auages as far as <HI>Perou</HI> do not &s;o, but rather do keepe them whole in Sepulchers, which be in many places as &s;caffoldes of nine and ten foote height. the rooffe wher|of is all couered with mattes, whereuponthey &s;tretch out their dead rancked according to the order of their decea&s;e. So almo&s;t our Sauages doe, &s;auing that their &s;epulchers are le&s;&s;er and lower, made after the forme of Cages, which they couer very properly, and there they lay their dead.
<PB N="304" REF="164">
Which we call to bury, and not to interre &s;eeing they are not within the earth.</P>
<P>Now although that many nations haue thought good to keepe the dead bodies: yet it is better to follow that which nature requireth, which is, to render to the earth that which belongeth vnto her, which (as <HI>Lucrece</HI> &s;aith)

<P>The Romans did leaue the entombing of the bodies, hauing perceiued that the long warres did bring di&s;order vnto it, and that the dead corps were vnburied, which <NOTE PLACE="marg">Arnob. lib. <HI>8.</HI></NOTE>by the lawes of the twelue Tables it was behoouefull to bury out of the towne, like as they did in <HI>Athens.</HI> Wher|upon <HI>Arnobius</HI> &s;peaking again&s;t the Gentils: <HI>Wee doe not feare</HI> (&s;aith he) <HI>as you thinke, the ran&s;acking of our graues, but wee keepe the mo&s;t ancient and be&s;t cu&s;tome of burying.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> (who blameth the <HI>Gaullois</HI> as much as he can) &s;aith in his <HI>Phociques,</HI> that they had no care to bury their dead, but we haue &s;hewed the contrary heeretofore: And though it were &s;o, he &s;peaketh of the ouerthrow of the army of <HI>Brennus.</HI> The &s;ame might haue beene &s;aid of the <HI>Nabateens,</HI> Who (according to <HI>Strabo)</HI> did that
<PB N="305" REF="164">
which <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> doth obiect to the <HI>Gaullois,</HI> and buried the bodies of their kinges in dunghils.</P>
<P>Our Sauages are more kinde then &s;o, and haue all that which the office of humanitie may de&s;ire, yea euen more. For after they haue brought the dead to his re&s;t, euery one maketh him a pre&s;ent of the be&s;t thing he hath. Some doe couer him with many skinnes of Beuers, of Otters and other bea&s;tes: others pre&s;ent him with bowes, ar|rowes, quiuers, kniues, <HI>Matachiaz,</HI> and other thinges. Which they haue in common, not onely with them of <HI>Florida,</HI> who for want of furres, doe &s;et vpon the &s;epul|chers the cuppe wherein the decea&s;&s;ed was accu&s;tomed to drinke, and all about them they plant great number of ar|rowes: Item they of Bra&s;ill who doe bury with their dead, thinges made of feathers and Carkenets: and they of <HI>Pe|rou,</HI> who (before the comming of the the Spaniardes) did fill their tombes with trea&s;ures: But al&s;o with many na|tions of the&s;e our partes, which did the &s;ame euen from the fir&s;t time after the floud, as may be coniectured by the writing (though deceitfull) of the Sepulcher of <HI>Semi|ramis</HI> Queene of Babylon, containing that he of her &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors that had neede of mony &s;hould make it to be ope|ned, and that he &s;hould finde there euen as much as he would haue. Whereof <HI>Darius</HI> willing to make triall, found in it nothing el&s;e but other letters &s;peaking in this &s;orte: <HI>&V;nle&s;&s;e thou wert a wicked man and vn&s;atiable thou wouldst not haue, through couetou&s;ne&s;&s;e, &s;o troubled the quiet of the dead, and broken downe their Sepulchers.</HI> I would thinke this cu&s;tome to haue beene onely among the Hea|then, were it not that I finde in <HI>Io&s;ephus</HI> his hi&s;tory that <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Io&s;eph.</HI> 7. booke 12 th. of the anti|quity of the Iewes.</NOTE><HI>Salomon</HI> did put in the Sepulcher of <HI>Dauid</HI> his father a|boue three millions of gould, which were rifled thirteene hundred yeeres after.</P>
<P>This cu&s;tome to put gould into the Sepulchers being come euen to the Romans, was forbidden by the twelue tables, al&s;o the exce&s;&s;iue expences that many did make in
<PB N="306" REF="165">
watering the bodies with precious liquors, and other my|&s;teries that we haue recited heeretofore. And notwith|&s;tanding many &s;imple and fooli&s;h men and women did or|daine by will and te&s;tament, that one &s;hould bury with their bodies their ornamentes, ringes, and iewels (which the Greekes did call <HI>entaphia)</HI> as there is a forme &s;eene of <NOTE PLACE="marg">L. Medico. D de auro, arg. &amp;c. leg. L. fer|uo alieno. D. de leg. <HI>1.</HI> L. &amp; &s;i|quis.

<Q><P>Thou that pa&s;&s;est by, whom&s;oeuer thou bee&s;t, and from what parte &s;oeuer thou comme&s;t, for I am &s;ure that thou wilt come: I am that Cyrus who got the dominion to the Per&s;ians: I pray thee enuie not this little parcell of grounde which co|uereth my poore body.</P></Q>
<P>So then our Sauages are not excu&s;able in putting all the be&s;t ornamentes they haue into the Sepulchers of the dead, &s;eeing they might reape commodity by them. But one may an&s;wer for them that they haue this cu&s;tome e|uen from their fathers beginning (for we &s;ee that almo&s;t from the very time of the floud the like hath beene done in this hither world) and giuing to their dead their furres, <HI>Matachias,</HI> Bowes, Arrowes, and Quiuers, they were thinges that they had no neede of.</P>
<P>And notwith&s;tanding this doth not cleere the Spani|ardes from blame, who haue robbed the Sepulchers of the Indians of <HI>Perou,</HI> and ca&s;t the bones on the dunghill: nor
<PB N="307" REF="165">

<P><HI>For as</HI> I&s;odorus <HI>&s;aith of</HI> Damiette <HI>in an Epi&s;tle:</HI> It is the parte of enemies voide of all humanitie to robbe the bodies of the dead, which cannot defende them&s;elues, Nature it &s;elfe hath giuen this to many, that hatred doth cea&s;&s;e after death, and doe reconcile them&s;elues with the decea&s;&s;ed.
