<HEAD>To the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>_HAving heretofore publi&s;hed to the World &s;everall <HI>Treati&s;es</HI> tending to the Practice of the <HI>Sciences Mathematicall;</HI> as, my <HI>Arithmetick</HI> in Four Parts, 1. <HI>Vulgar,</HI> 2. <HI>Decimal,</HI> 3. <HI>In&s;trumental,</HI> and 4. <HI>Alge|braicall;</HI> my <HI>Arithmeticall Recreations;</HI> my <HI>&V;&s;e of the Line of Proportion made ea&s;ie; the &V;&s;e of Napiers Bones;</HI> my <HI>Compleat Surveyor;</HI> my <HI>Platform for Purcha&s;ers, Guide for Builders,</HI> and <HI>Mate for Mea&s;ures,</HI> &amp;c. All which have found good acceptance in the World, as may appear by the &s;everall <HI>Editions</HI> which &s;ome of them have pa&s;&s;ed the Pre&s;s: I thought good at length to publi&s;h &s;omething that might be <HI>u&s;efull</HI> and <HI>beneficial</HI> for my <HI>Country-men, Engli&s;h Navigators;</HI> hoping that I &s;hall receive from them (for the pains I have already, and hereafter &s;hall take for their good and advantage) no le&s;s En|couragement by their acceptance of what (out of free good will) I tender to them, then I have already from others, for what I have made publick for their U&s;e and Service.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Nine</HI> following <HI>Treati&s;es</HI> I have furni&s;hed the <HI>Young Sea-man</HI> with &s;uch practical <HI>Exerci&s;es</HI> as tend wholly to his <HI>Em|ployment</HI> at <HI>Sea:</HI> beginning, fir&s;t, with &s;ome few <HI>Geometricall Rudiments</HI> that are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for him to under&s;tand and be perfect in the Practice of, before he launch farther into the <HI>Mathematicall Ocean.</HI></P>
<P>From the&s;e <HI>Elements,</HI> I proceed to the <HI>Geometricall Dimen|&s;ion</HI> of <HI>Triangles</HI> both <HI>Plain</HI> and <HI>Sphericall,</HI> upon the <HI>Solution</HI>
<PB REF="4"> whereof all the <HI>Practick Parts</HI> of the <HI>Mathematicks</HI> do depend. For on the <HI>Solution</HI> of <HI>Right-lined Triangles,</HI> all <HI>Propo&s;itions</HI> which concern <HI>Longimetria,</HI> or the Mea&s;uring of <HI>Heights, Depths</HI> and <HI>Di&s;tances,</HI> either upon the <HI>Land</HI> or at <HI>Sea;</HI> all in <HI>Planometria,</HI> as Mea&s;uring of <HI>Land, Board, Gla&s;s, Pavements, Hangings,</HI> &amp;c. all in <HI>Striometria,</HI> or the Men&s;uration of <HI>Solids,</HI> &s;uch as <HI>Stone, Timber,</HI> and the like; all Problems of <HI>Sailing,</HI> both by the <HI>Plain Sea-Chart,</HI> and al&s;o by that of <HI>Mercator</HI>'s Projection; all that concerns <HI>Fortification, Gunnery,</HI> &amp;c. have their depen|dence.&mdash;And by the <HI>Solution</HI> of <HI>Sphericall Triangles, Problems</HI> in <HI>A&s;tronomie, Geography, Sailing by the Arch of a great Circle, Dialling,</HI> Mea&s;uring of the Di&s;tance of <HI>Stars, Comets,</HI> &amp;c. are to be re&s;olved.</P>
<P><HI>Trigonometria,</HI> therefore, being the <HI>Ba&s;is</HI> or <HI>Foundation</HI> upon which the forementioned <HI>Super&s;tructures</HI> are <HI>erected;</HI> I cho&s;e fir&s;t to begin with that. And how I have performed it, and to what U&s;es I have applied it, which tend to the Practice of <HI>the Art of Navigation,</HI> the <HI>Contents</HI> of the &s;everall <HI>Exerci&s;es</HI> will (in part) declare.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Geometricall re&s;olving</HI> of <HI>Triangles</HI> both <HI>plain</HI> and <HI>&s;phe|ricall,</HI> I have gone in a <HI>Path</HI> not before <HI>beaten.</HI> And therefore, if I have at any time gone out of my way, either by <HI>deficiency</HI> or <HI>redundancy,</HI> I hope the <HI>Reader</HI> will pardon me. I am &s;ure the ingenious <HI>Mathematician</HI> (who (at fir&s;t &s;ight) will di&s;cover the manner and waies of Working, and al&s;o the Ground and De|mon&s;tration thereof) will not <HI>carp</HI> or <HI>cavilat,</HI> but rather in|form <HI>me</HI> or the <HI>Reader</HI> of any &s;uch <HI>Deviation.</HI> But in the Pur|&s;uance of every <HI>Exerci&s;e,</HI> I have therein retained &s;uch a <HI>Me|thod,</HI> that I could not well &s;tep a&s;ide. And for the certainty of the manner of the <HI>Geometricall Operations,</HI> (if they be carefully performed) I dare aver that you may (if the Radius of your Line of Chords be but 4 or 5 <HI>Inches</HI>) come within a few Mi|nutes of Calculation; which will be &s;ufficient for the <HI>Sea-man's &V;&s;e,</HI> for him thereby to re&s;olve &s;uch <HI>Problems</HI> in <HI>A&s;tronomie, Geography</HI> or <HI>Navigation,</HI> as at any time he &s;hall (in his Practice)
<PB REF="4"> have occa&s;ion for. And that Proof or Triall may be made thereof, (though I could in a few Lines demon&s;trate the nature and manner of Working) I have to every <HI>Ca&s;e, Propo&s;ition</HI> and <HI>Problem</HI> in the whole <HI>Work</HI> contained, added the <HI>Analogies</HI> or <HI>Proportions</HI> by which they may be <HI>&s;olved</HI> by the <HI>Canons</HI> of <HI>Ar|tificial Sines</HI> and <HI>Tangents,</HI> and the <HI>Chiliads</HI> of <HI>Logarithms:</HI> So that &s;uch as have tho&s;e Tables (and know their U&s;e) may work any <HI>Propo&s;ition</HI> by them, and by that di&s;cover the Diffe|rence between <HI>Calculation</HI> and this <HI>Geometricall</HI> way of <HI>Opera|tion.</HI></P>
<P>And that the <HI>young Sea-man</HI> may not (at any time) be to &s;eek of <HI>Tools</HI> to work with, (in ca&s;e of any Mi&s;carriage at Sea) I have not onely &s;hewed him how to <HI>u&s;e,</HI> but al&s;o the manner how to <HI>make,</HI> all &s;uch <HI>In&s;truments</HI> as will be in u&s;e to him in the Practice of the&s;e <HI>Exerci&s;es:</HI> As of his <HI>Line of Chords,</HI> which is the chief; and al&s;o of a <HI>Sea-Chart</HI> according to <HI>Mercator</HI>'s Pro|jection, without the help of a <HI>Table</HI> of <HI>Meridionall Parts,</HI> or a <HI>Meridian Line,</HI> but <HI>ea&s;ily</HI> and <HI>&s;peedily</HI> by a <HI>Line of Chords</HI> onely; and that either <HI>General,</HI> from the <HI>Aequinoctial</HI> towards either <HI>Pole;</HI> or <HI>Particular,</HI> for any de&s;igned <HI>Navigation.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, in the Working of the &s;everall <HI>Que&s;tions</HI> by <HI>Mer|cator</HI>'s <HI>Chart,</HI> I have, at the end of every <HI>Problem,</HI> given an ac|count of the Difference ari&s;ing between Working by that and the <HI>Plain Sea-Chart;</HI> whereby the <HI>Errours</HI> of the one are clearly detected, and the <HI>Verity</HI> of the other di&s;covered.</P>
<P>I might have proceeded farther, to the performance of other things by the <HI>Line of Chords</HI> onely; as to &s;hew the manner of <HI>Sailing</HI> by the <HI>Arch of a great Circle:</HI> but that, with &s;ome other things tending to <HI>Navigation,</HI> I &s;hall &s;hortly make publick in a <HI>Treati&s;e</HI> formerly written by my &s;elf and Mr. <HI>Vincent Wing,</HI> now in my hands, and almo&s;t ready for the <HI>Pre&s;s,</HI> and wholly de&s;ign|ed for the U&s;e of <HI>Sea-men.</HI>&mdash;And for farther U&s;e of this Line, I have in a Treati&s;e (now in the Pre&s;s) taught the manner how to delineate all manner of <HI>Sun-Dials</HI> by <HI>projecting</HI> of the <HI>Sphere in Plano,</HI> whereby not onely the <HI>Making,</HI> but the <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> al&s;o, of
<PB REF="5"> <HI>Dials</HI> is di&s;covered. To which Treati&s;e (if my pre&s;ent occa&s;i|ons will permit) I &s;hall adde both an Arithmeticall and an In|&s;trumentall way of <HI>Dialling</HI> al&s;o.</P>
<P>Thus, friendly Reader, at pre&s;ent, I pre&s;ent thee with This; and in a few Months thou &s;halt (God willing) participate of tho&s;e above mentioned. All which I hope will be as kindly accepted, as they are freely tendered by</P>

<P N="8">8. The Complement of an Angle to a Semicircle is &s;o much as that Angle wanteth of 180 degr. So the Angle C being 53 degr. 7 min. take 53 degr. 7 min. from 180 degr.

<P N="13">13. A Triangle is either right-angled, or oblique-angled.</P>
<P N="14">14. A right-angled Triangle is &s;uch a Triangle as hath one right Angle. As the Triangle C A B hath one right Angle, namely, that at A, which containeth ju&s;t 90 degr.</P>
<P N="15">15. In every right-angled Triangle, that Side which &s;ub|tendeth (or lieth oppo&s;ite to) the right Angle is called the <HI>Hypotenu&s;e;</HI> and of the other two Sides the one is called the Perpendicular, and the other the Ba&s;e, at plea&s;ure: But mo&s;t commonly the &s;horter &s;ide is called the Perpendicular, and the longer the Ba&s;e. Thus in the Triangle C B A, B C is the Hypotenu&s;e, C A the Perpendicular, and A B the Ba&s;e.</P>
<P N="16">16. In every right-angled Triangle, if you have one of the acute Angles given, the other is al&s;o given, it being the Complement thereof to 90 degr. As in the Triangle C A B, if you have the Angle at C 53 degr. 7 min. given, you have al&s;o the Angle at B given, it being the Complement of that at C to 90 degr. wherefore take 53 degr. 7 min. from
<PB N="14" REF="13"> 90 degr. and there will remain 36 degr. 53 min. which is the quantity of the Angle at B.</P>

<FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>geometrical diagram</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE> equal to two right Angles, or contain 180 degr. Therefore, if you have any two Angles of a Triangle given, you have al&s;o the third given, it being the Complement of the other two to 180 degr.&mdash;Thus in the Triangle C D B, if there were given the Angle C D B 43 degr. 20 min. and the Angle C B D 14 degr. 40 min. I &s;ay, by con&s;equence you have the third Angle D C B al&s;o given, it being the Complement of the other two to 180 degr. For the two given Angles B D C 43 degr. 20 min. and C B D 14 degr. 40 min. being added together, make 58 degr. which being taken from 180 degr. there will remain 122 degr. the quantity of the obtu&s;e Angle D C B.</P>
<P N="18">18. In all Triangles what&s;oever, the Sides are in proportion one to the other as the Sines of the Angles oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e Sides. So in the Triangle C D B, the Sine of the Angle at D is the proportion to the Side C B, which is oppo&s;ite to it; as the Sine of the Angle at B is to the Side C D, or the Angle at C to the Side D B.</P>

<P>BY the Third Propo&s;ition you found the Sun's <HI>Amplitude</HI> at his <HI>ri&s;ing</HI> or <HI>&s;etting</HI> to be 33 degr. 20 min. from the true <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> or <HI>We&s;t</HI> Points of the <HI>Horizon</HI> towards the <HI>North.</HI> Having thus before-hand found the <HI>Amplitude,</HI> in the Morning I &s;et my <HI>Compa&s;s</HI> to the Sun at his Ri&s;ing; and if I find that the Sun by my Compa&s;s do ri&s;e 33 d. 20 m. from the <HI>We&s;t</HI>-point thereof towards the <HI>North,</HI> then may I be a&s;certain'd that my <HI>Compa&s;s</HI> hath no <HI>Variation,</HI> but that the <HI>Fly</HI> or <HI>Wires</HI> do point directly <HI>North</HI> and <HI>South.</HI>&mdash;But finding before-hand the <HI>Amplitude</HI> to be 33 d. 20 m. and I &s;hould find the Sun to ri&s;e but 28 degr. from the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI>-point of my Compa&s;s, then &s;ub&s;tracting 28 degr. from 33 degr. 20 min. the difference is 5 degr. 20 min. and &s;o much doth my <HI>Compa&s;s</HI> varie from the true <HI>Ea&s;t</HI>-point, and con|&s;equently all the other Points of the <HI>Compa&s;s</HI> as much.</P>

<HEAD>The Making of the <HI>Plain Sea-Chart.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A <HI>Sea-Chart</HI> may be made either <HI>general,</HI> or <HI>particular.</HI> A <HI>General Sea-Chart</HI> is that who&s;e Degrees of <HI>Latitude</HI> pro|ceed from the <HI>Aequinoctial</HI> to either <HI>Pole,</HI> which in the <HI>com|mon Sea-Chart</HI> may be done; but it will be egregiou&s;ly fal&s;e, as the Degrees of <HI>Latitude</HI> grow nearer the <HI>Pole,</HI> as I have al|ready declared.&mdash;A <HI>Particular Sea-Chart</HI> is &s;uch a one as is made properly for one particular <HI>Navigation:</HI> as if your
<PB N="159" REF="90"> whole <HI>Navigation</HI> were not to exceed the <HI>Latitudes</HI> of 48 and 60 degr. of <HI>Latitude,</HI> and not to differ in <HI>Longitude</HI> above 8 degrees.</P>
<P>Now to <HI>project</HI> or <HI>make</HI> &s;uch a <HI>Chart;</HI> Fir&s;t, draw a right Line A B, repre&s;enting the <HI>Meridian,</HI> and cro&s;s it at right Angles in the Point A with another right Line A D, repre&s;enting the <HI>Parallel</HI> of your lea&s;t <HI>Latitude,</HI> namely, of 48 degr.&mdash; Secondly, con&s;ider what Di&s;tance you will have your <HI>Parallels of Longitude</HI> and <HI>Latitude</HI> to be, (for in this <HI>Chart</HI> they are both equal,) whether an Inch, 2, 3, or 4 Inches, (for the lar|ger the better.) But in this Example I have made them one|ly half an Inch. I take therefore half an Inch out of an exact <HI>Scale,</HI> and run it up upon the <HI>Meridian Line</HI> A B, from A to 49, from 49 to 50, from 50 to 51, &amp;c. till I come to my greate&s;t <HI>Latitude,</HI> which is here &s;uppo&s;ed to be 60 degr.&mdash;Thirdly, run the &s;ame Di&s;tance of half an Inch from A towards D, upon the Line A D, eight times, becau&s;e the Difference of <HI>Longitude</HI> in your whole <HI>Navigation</HI> will not exceed 8 degrees.&mdash; Fourthly, draw the Line C D, parallel to A B, and B C, par|allel to A D, and run the &s;ame Di&s;tances upon the Line B C as are upon the Line A D, and the &s;ame upon C D as are upon the Line A B.&mdash;Fifthly, from each Degree of <HI>Latitude</HI> in the Line A B draw to the like Degree of <HI>Latitude</HI> in the Line C D a right Line, as 49, 49; 50, 50; 51, 51; 52, 52; &amp;c. till you have drawn all your <HI>Parallels</HI> of <HI>Latitude.</HI>&mdash;Sixthly, for your <HI>Meridians,</HI> they are to be drawn in like manner as were the <HI>Parallels</HI> of <HI>Latitude,</HI> all of them equidi&s;tant, and par|allel to your fir&s;t <HI>Meridian</HI> A B, as the Lines 1, 1; 2, 2; 3, 3; &amp;c. And by this means have you the <HI>Meridians</HI> and <HI>Parallels</HI> drawn.</P>
<P>The <HI>grand Divi&s;ions,</HI> or <HI>whole Degrees,</HI> being thus &s;et upon your <HI>Chart,</HI> we now come to &s;ub-divide them. And for the dividing of the Degrees of the <HI>Aequinoctial</HI> at the top and bottom of your <HI>Chart,</HI> let each of them be divided into 5 or 10 parts, and each of tho&s;e parts &s;ub-divided into 5 or 10
<PB N="160" REF="91"> more le&s;s parts, according as Quantity will permit; for eve|ry one of them is &s;uppo&s;ed to be divided into 100 or 1000 parts.</P>
<P>For the dividing of the <HI>Degrees of Latitude;</HI> they may be di|vided as tho&s;e of <HI>Longitude</HI> were, into 100 parts. But &s;ome|times each Degree is &s;ubdivided into 60 <HI>Minutes,</HI> or <HI>Engli&s;h Miles,</HI> or into 20 <HI>Leagues.</HI>&mdash;Now I have divided the <HI>Degrees of Latitude</HI> in this <HI>Chart</HI> each of them into 5 parts, by which means it is capable of the <HI>Numeration</HI> either by <HI>Miles, Leagues, Cente&s;ms,</HI> or 100 parts.&mdash;For if you count by 60 <HI>minutes,</HI> or <HI>miles,</HI> then every of tho&s;e Divi&s;ions will be 12 <HI>minutes,</HI> or <HI>miles;</HI> if by 20 <HI>Leagues,</HI> then every Divi&s;ion will contain 4 <HI>Leagues;</HI> and if by <HI>Cente&s;ms</HI> or 100 parts, then every of them is 20 <HI>Cente&s;ms.</HI> And thus much concerning the <HI>Making</HI> or <HI>Projecting</HI> of this <HI>Chart.</HI> I now come to &s;hew</P>

<HEAD><HI>PROBL. I.</HI> How to &s;et any Place upon your <HI>Chart</HI> according to its Longitude and Latitude.</HEAD>
<P>IF the two Places lie under one and the &s;ame Parallel, dif|fering not at all in Latitude, but onely in Longitude, then the Cour&s;e leading from the one to the other is directly Ea&s;t or We&s;t. As E and F are two Places lying under the Par|allel of 50 degr. of Latitude, and differ in Longitude 5 &frac12; deg. Lay a Ruler to 5 &frac12; degr. both at the top and bottom of the Chord, and where the Ruler cro&s;&s;eth the Parallel of 50 degr. as at F, there is your other Place upon the Chart. So E and F lie in 50 degr. of Latitude, and differ in Longitude 5 &frac12; degr.</P>
<P>But if the two Places to be &s;et upon the Chart differ onely in Latitude, and lie under the &s;ame Meridian as G F, then the Cour&s;e leading from the one to the other is directly North or South, and the Difference of Latitude of F and G is 2 degr. G lying in the Latitude of 48 degr. and F in the Latitude of 50 degr.</P>
<P>But if the Places to be &s;et upon the Chart differ both in Longitude and Latitude, as A and F, then the Cour&s;e lea|ding from the one to the other is upon &s;ome other Point of the Compa&s;s, &s;o far di&s;tant from the Meridian as is the quanti|ty of the Angle E A F, which here is 70 degr. 1 min. that is upon the E. N. E. Point 2 degr. 31 min. Ea&s;terly.</P>
<P>This Angle may be found either by Protraction by your Line of Chords, or it may be protracted by your <HI>Protracting
<PB N="162" REF="92"> Quadrant,</HI> which in all the&s;e Operations upon the Chart is be&s;t, for that it avoids the drawing of Arches of Circles upon your Chart or Blank. So then if you were to protract the Angle E A F by your <HI>Protracting Quadrant;</HI> Lay the Centre A of your Quadrant upon the Point A in your Chart, and the Meridian Line of the Quadrant A B upon the Meridian Line of your Chart; then will the Line A C of the Quadrant lie upon the Parallel A D of your Chart: and the Angle that you are to protract being 70 degr. 1 min. by the edge of your Quadrant make a &s;mall Mark or Prick with your Needle, and from A through that Point draw a right Line, which will be the Line A F.</P>

<P>Then to find their Difference of Longitude; Take in your Compa&s;&s;es the Di&s;tance between R and S, and mea&s;uring it upon the bottom of the Chart, it will reach from A to 4 degr. 24 min. And &s;uch is the Difference of Longitude of the two Places Q and R.</P>

And if a Chart were made that the Aequinoctial Degrees were two Inches di|&s;tant, and it pa&s;&s;ed upon a &s;mooth Board, many Nauticall Con|clu&s;ions might be wrought upon it very exactly. Being thus far prepared, I will now &s;hew you how, from the Line A B,</P>
<DIV5 TYPE="solution">
<HEAD>To divide the Meridian Line of a Sea-Chart.</HEAD>
<P>A Sea-Chart, according to this Projection, may be made either General, or Particular. I call that a General Sea-Chart, who&s;e Line E H, in the following Figure, repre&s;ents the Aequinoctial, as the Line E H there doth the Parallel of 49 degr. and &s;o I will make the Chart following to contain all Latitudes between 49 degr. and 57 degr. who&s;e Difference of Longitude exceedeth not 8 degr.</P>
<P>Now to project &s;uch a Chart, having drawn the Line E F for the Meridian, and cro&s;&s;ed it at right Angles with another Line repre&s;enting the Parallel of 49 d. parallel thereto draw another Line F G, repre&s;enting the Parallel of 57 degr. and another Meridian G H, parallel to F E. So &s;hall you have made the Parallelogram E F G H.</P>
<P>This done, con&s;ider how far di&s;tant you would have your Degrees of Longitude upon the Aequinoctial each from other, as &s;uppo&s;e (and as in this Chart I have made them to be) half an Inch. Take half an Inch out of a Line of Inches, and run that Di&s;tance along the Line E H from E to 1, from 1 to 2, from 2 to 3, &amp;c. And al&s;o doe the like upon the Line F G, at the top of the Chart, drawing the Lines 1, 1; 2, 2; 3, 3; &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now for the Dividing of the Meridians E F and H G, re|pair to the foregoing Figure, taking in your Compa&s;&s;es the Di&s;tance that is between Degree and Degree of the Aequino|ctial,
<PB REF="101">
<PB REF="102">
<PB N="177" REF="102">which in our Example is half an Inch. With this Di|&s;tance, &s;et one foot of the Compa&s;&s;es in the Point D, and with the other de&s;cribe the Arch <HI>m m;</HI> by the very Edge whereof draw the Line A G: &s;o is your Figure prepared to divide the Meridian-line of a Sea-Chart who&s;e Degrees of Longitude are half an Inch di&s;tant.</P>
<P>Now in re&s;pect that your fir&s;t Parallel of Latitude E H in your Chart is drawn for 49 degr. your next Parallel mu&s;t be 50 degr. Wherefore &s;et one foot of your Compa&s;&s;es upon 50 degr. in the Line A B, and with the other take the neare&s;t Di&s;tance to the Line A G: that is done by turning the Com|pa&s;&s;es about till the moveable foot do onely touch the Line A G; which when it &s;o doth, that Di&s;tance at which your Com|pa&s;&s;es then are, being &s;et upon the Meridian of your Chart, will reach from 49 degr. to 50, which being &s;et upon your Chart, on both &s;ides thereof, from 49 draw the Line 50. 50 will give you the Parallel of 50 d. of Latitude. In like man|ner for the Parallel of 51 degr. Set one foot of the Compa&s;&s;es in 51 degr. upon the Line A B of the former Figure, and with the other take the lea&s;t Di&s;tance to the Line A G: this Di&s;tance &s;et upon the Meridian of your Sea-Chart, on both &s;ides thereof, will reach from 50 to 51; and there draw the Parallel 51, 51.&mdash;Likewi&s;e for the Parallel of 52 degr. Set one foot of the Compa&s;&s;es in 52 degr. in the Line A B, taking the neare&s;t Di&s;tance to the Line A G: that Di&s;tance &s;et upon the Meridian of your Sea-Chart, on both &s;ides thereof, will reach from 51 to 52; and there draw the Parallel of 52, 52. Doe thus with all the Degrees, as 53, 54, 55, 56, and 57. So &s;hall the Meridians of your Chart E F and H G be divided into whole Degrees.</P>
<P>For the Sub-divi&s;ions of the&s;e Degrees, they may be divi|ded each of them into equal parts, as the Divi&s;ions at the top and bottome of the Chart ought to be; but the Degrees of the Meridian, as they grow higher, they ought &s;till to grow greater. But the Difference is &s;o &s;mall, that it cannot produce
<PB N="178" REF="103"> any con&s;iderable Errour, though the Sub-divi&s;ions be all made equal between Degree and Degree. You may therefore di|vide them either into 60 Minutes or Engli&s;h Miles, or into 20 Leagues, or into 100 parts of Degrees, as you &s;hall be&s;t like of.</P>
<P><HI>But if you would make a Chart that the Di&s;tance between De|gree and Degree upon the Aequinoctial &s;hould be an Inch, or any other Di&s;tance le&s;s then A D in the foregoing Figure; take that Di|&s;tance (as &s;uppo&s;e an Inch) in your Compa&s;&s;es, and &s;etting one foot in D, with the other de&s;cribe the Arch</HI> o o, <HI>and draw the Line A H onely to touch the Arch</HI> o o. <HI>The lea&s;t Di&s;tance taken from each Degree to this Line A H &s;hall give you the Di&s;tance of the Degrees upon the Meridian of a Sea-Chart, who&s;e Di&s;tance of Degrees up|on the Aequinoctial are an Inch from each other.</HI></P>

<P>LET two Meridians, A B and C D, be drawn through A and C, according to the Difference of Longitude, and a Parallel of Latitude through A, cro&s;&s;ing the Meridian C D in the Point D. Then upon the Point A protract an Angle of 33 degr. 45 min. the quantity of the Rhumb from the Meri|dian, and draw the Line A C cro&s;&s;ing the Meridian C D in C.

<PB N="186" REF="107"> mea&s;ured upon the Meridian-line of the Chart, (re&s;pect be|ing had to the Latitude of the Places) that is, &s;o much above the greater Latitude as below the le&s;&s;er Latitude, you will find it to contain 6 degr.</P>

<P>Through the two given Latitudes 50 d. and 52 &frac12;, at A and O draw two Parallels, O P and A D, upon which &s;et the Dif|ference of Longitudes from O to P, and from A to Q, 6 degr.

<P>Then to find the proper Di&s;tance upon the Rhumb; Take the Line A P in your Compa&s;&s;es, and mea&s;ure it upon the Me|ridian-line, &s;o that one foot may be above the greater Latitude &s;o much as the other is below the le&s;&s;er; and you will find the Compa&s;s-points to re&s;t in E and S, E being one whole Degree below the le&s;&s;er Latitude, and S one Degree above the grea|ter.

<P>THE Rhumb-Line A P being drawn, &s;et off thereupon 36 Leagues (which was the way that the Ship made upon the fifth Rhumb before the Wind changed) from A to T, (which Di&s;tance mu&s;t be taken out of the Meridian-line by opening the Compa&s;&s;es from 50 d. to 51, 48. or better, to as much below 50 d. as above 51 d.) So &s;hall the Point T be the Place that the Ship was in when the Wind altered. So a Paral|lel drawn through T upon the Chart will cut the Meridian at V in 51 d. and in that Latitude the Ship was. Now to find in what Longitude &s;he was; Take in your Compa&s;&s;es the Line T V, and mea&s;ure it at the bottom of the Chart, you &s;hall find it will reach from E to 2 d. 21 m. And in that Longitude the Ship then was.</P>
<P>This done, upon the Point T (where the Wind changed, and drove the Ship 2 Points more Ea&s;twardly, namely, upon the E. by N. Point) protract an Angle of 22 d. 30 m. namely, the An|gle P T X, which is the Rhumb upon which the Ship &s;ailed 50 Leagues after the Wind changed. Therefore take 50 Leagues out of the Meridian-line, and &s;et them from T to X. So &s;hall X be the Place that the Ship was in after &s;he had &s;ailed 50 Leagues upon the E. by N.
