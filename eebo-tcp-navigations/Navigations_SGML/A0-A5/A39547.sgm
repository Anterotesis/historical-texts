<PB REF="1" MS="y">
<HEAD><HI>Fair Trade,</HI> be&s;ides the Heavy Duties it lies under, &s;uffers yet more from the <HI>Frauds</HI> of <HI>Smuglers</HI> and the <HI>Exactions</HI> of <HI>Officers,</HI> for preventing both which, the <HI>BILL</HI> before the <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> is Calculated &s;o that 'tis no wonder if the Pri|vate Intere&s;ts of <HI>Clande&s;tine Traders</HI> and <HI>Officers,</HI> &s;hould unite, in rai&s;ing a Clamour again&s;t it.</HEAD>
<P><TABLE>
<ROW>
<CELL ROLE="label">The <HI>Clau&s;es</HI> whereof are to the Effect following.</CELL>
<CELL ROLE="label">&nbsp;</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>1. THAT all Ships under ju&s;t &s;u&s;picion of an Irregular Trade, by hover|ing and remaining unnece&s;&s;arily near the Shore, &s;hould be &s;ubject to a Search, and the Ma&s;ter obliged to declare his Con&s;ignment.</CELL>
<CELL>SUCH Declaration of the Ma&s;ter, is no more than what is already required from all who come into Port, and this Clau&s;e will not delay any Ship which duly pro|&s;ecutes her Voyage, or prevent taking in ne|ce&s;&s;ary Supplies.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>2. The &s;econd Clau&s;e &s;ubjects all Per&s;ons any way aiding or a&s;&s;i&s;ting in Smugling, to a Penalty, and al&s;o forfeits the Hor&s;es or Car|riages imployed in &s;uch Service.</CELL>
<CELL>This was in the French Prohibition Act, and the &s;peedy Conviction, will make it more Ef|fectual, as well as more U&s;eful, to the Poor.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>3, 4, 5. The third, fourth, and fifth Clau|&s;es require the Making True Entries, with re|ference to the Countrey, and al&s;o the Proper|ty of the Goods, under a Penalty, on any Prevarication.</CELL>
<CELL>This nece&s;&s;ary to prevent Colouring French or Aliens Goods, under other Names; but if the Swearing <HI>Toties Quoties</HI> be objected to, a General Oath may &s;uffice in&s;tead of it.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>6. The &s;ixth Clau&s;e provides for the Secu|rity of Goods ca&s;ually ca&s;t on Shore, till the Duties are paid.</CELL>
<CELL>The King's Intere&s;t in &s;uch Goods, would help to pre&s;erve the Subjects Right better than it would be otherwi&s;e.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>7. Brandy in &s;mall Casks, or Salt in Bags, to be forfeited, if found on board Ships pre|tending to be bound to <HI>Ireland,</HI> or the Neigh|bouring I&s;lands, as well as if Imported to <HI>Eng|land.</HI></CELL>
<CELL>This Clau&s;e makes the Smugling more diffi|cult in the&s;e In&s;tances, wherein it was before too frequently practi&s;ed.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>8. No Hou&s;e to be broken open in Search of Uncu&s;tomed Goods, but on fre&s;h Pur&s;uit, or Information upon Oath, and the Informer to have Equal Share with the Officer.</CELL>
<CELL>'Tis no unu&s;ual Practice for Merchants to di|&s;turb one another in the &s;ame Trade, by whi|&s;pering Stories to Officers, without any Foun|dation, which is a great Mi&s;chief, when it goes &s;o far as to break into Hou&s;es. The other part is for Encouraging Ju&s;t Informations.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>9. All Merchants to be Civilly treated and diligently di&s;patched, on pain of &s;u&s;pending the Officer who neglects his Duty herein. That is in di&s;patching due Certificates of Over En|tries or Damage; and Po&s;t Entries to be a|voided as much as is po&s;&s;ible.</CELL>
<CELL>The Fundamental Security to the Revenue ari&s;es from the Obligation upon Merchants to enter their Goods before they land them; And all Short Entries under Colour of Damage or any other Pretence what&s;oever, &s;ubjects &s;o much to Frauds by Collu&s;ive Practices with the Officers at the Water-&s;ide.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>10. Goods brought to the Ware-hou&s;e at the Merchants de&s;ire, for &s;ecuring the Duty to be entred in a certain time, or the Ware|hou&s;e room to be paid for.</CELL>
<CELL>This only to oblige the Merchants to di|&s;patch the Entring their Goods, in order to clear the Kings Ware-hou&s;e.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL><PB REF="2"> 11. Wines to be Imported in Certain Cask, on pain of Lo&s;ing the 12 <HI>per Cent.</HI> for Leakage, and to be obliged to enter as fill'd up, gaug|ing the Wine if otherwi&s;e Imported.</CELL>
<CELL>The Rule in the Book of Rates, which al|lows Outs, &s;uppo&s;es Certain Cask, and the Mer|chant who had before his Election on the En|try, Whether to Enter fill'd or unfill'd; will have it now on the Importation.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>12. Damaged Tobacco to be de&s;troyed, on certain Conditions.</CELL>
<CELL>The partiality of Officers in the Allowances for Damage, is a great Di&s;couragement to Fair Trade, which this Clau&s;e prevents, as well as prejudice to the Subject, by the Mix|ing of Unwhol&s;om Tobacco with Sound: and if the like Practice might be u&s;ed to Un&s;ound Wines, it would probably have the &s;ame good Effect every way.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>13. No Per&s;on to be admitted to Claim any Goods &s;eized, without giving Security to an|&s;wer Co&s;ts of Suit.</CELL>
<CELL>This to prevent Sham-Claims of Per&s;ons no way intere&s;ted in the Property of the Goods.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>14. No Goods to be carried Coa&s;t-ways without a Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e Di&s;patch, or Landed, but in pre&s;ence of an Officer.</CELL>
<CELL ROWS="3">The&s;e Three Clau&s;es nece&s;&s;ary to prevent the Frauds u&s;ually practi&s;ed in the Coa&s;t Trade.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>15. Fi&s;her Boats, Coal Ships, or other Coa&s;t|ing Ve&s;&s;els, taking in any Uncu&s;tomed or Prohibited, or Certificat Goods at Sea, with|out Warrant, &s;hall be forfeited, unle&s;s in Ca|&s;es of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>16. Foreign Goods carried up the Naviga|ble Rivers, &s;hall have Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e Di|&s;patches, as if carried from Port to Port.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>17. Endor&s;ed Cocquets to be by Actual En|dor&s;ement on the fir&s;t Warrant in all Ca&s;es where 'tis practicable.</CELL>
<CELL>This &s;aves the Merchant the unnece&s;&s;ary trouble and charge of Two Entries, and &s;e|cures the Revenue better from double Ship|ping of Sub&s;idy Goods and Double Deben|tures for Certificat Goods.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>18. No Bounty to be paid for Corn Ex|ported, without the &s;ame Proof which the Law already requires, before the Bond be Cancell'd.</CELL>
<CELL>Security being already required for Export|ing &s;uch Corn, the Rea&s;on of the Law holds again&s;t paying the Bounty, till &s;uch Security be duly di&s;charged by a Certificat of the Actual Exportation.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>19. No Ship importing any Foreign Goods &s;hall di&s;charge the &s;ame into Lighters, but on a Sufferance with Condition to &s;ecure a due Entry of all &s;uch Goods.</CELL>
<CELL>The un&s;hipping Goods before Entry creates a Forfeiture in Law; And tho' Trade may be accommodated in this Particular, yet the King's Security &s;hould not be le&s;&s;ened.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>20. Officers to be &s;ettled in the I&s;les of <HI>Man, Guernzy,</HI> and <HI>Jerzy,</HI> &amp;c. with Autho|rities to prevent Irregular Trade.</CELL>
<CELL>Without &s;uch Care tho&s;e I&s;lands may be made Magazines for Plantation and Prohibited Goods, which will be more ea&s;ily &s;tollen from thence into <HI>England.</HI></CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>21. and 22. Certain enumerated Goods paying very high Duties, as al&s;o all <HI>French</HI> and Prohibted Goods being &s;eized and con|demned to be &s;old by Inch of Candle; The King to have Two thirds of &s;uch Sale, paying the charge of Pro&s;ecution, and no Letter of Li|cence to be granted for Compounding &s;uch Seizures.</CELL>
<CELL>The Rea&s;on of the&s;e Clau&s;es is, that the King's Share by Compo&s;ition, and even his Moiety of the ordinary Apprai&s;ements, comes to le&s;s than the Duty on &s;ome Goods, which tends to run the Revenue into Forfeiture by Collu&s;ive Seizures, wherein the Merchant will find his Account.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL><PB REF="2"> 23. The Commi&s;&s;ioners may compound Petty Seizures only where the Sub&s;idy does not exceed 40 &s;hillings.</CELL>
<CELL>This always allowed in the Commi&s;&s;ion of the Cu&s;tom, as &s;uppo&s;ing the Goods will not an&s;wer the Charge of the Pro&s;ecution in the <HI>Exchequer;</HI> neverthele&s;s the Practice of it is unea&s;ie to hat Court.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>24. The Regi&s;ter of Ships hitherto requi|red for &s;uch only as trade to the Plantations, to be extended to all <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships trading to any Foreign Parts, in order to pre&s;erve the Pri|vileges intended by the Act of Navigation to <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Seamen entire to them.</CELL>
<CELL>This Clu&s;e does only pur&s;ue the Inten|tion of the Act of Navigation, by encoura|ging the Juilding of Ships in <HI>England,</HI> and employing of <HI>Englili&s;h</HI> Seamen.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>25. Ma&s;ters of Ships coming from Foreign Parts, tho' pretending to be in Balla&s;t, to make Declaration at the <HI>Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e</HI></CELL>
<CELL>That <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">he Pretence of Balla&s;t may not be a Cover to Fraud, as it proves too often.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>26, &amp; 30. The Commanders of Men of War and Yatchs coming from Foreign Parts, as al&s;o Ma&s;ters of Ve&s;&s;els employed in the Service of the Navy, Victualling, or Tran|&s;ports, to be &s;ubject to Declaration and Rules as well as others.</CELL>
<CELL>This nought to be a nece&s;&s;ary Caution, to prevent Opportunities of Smuggling, under Colour of the Publick Service.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>27, 28, 29. The Oaths required from Ma|&s;ters of Ships to be writ down on the Reports Inwards, and the Contents Outwards, to be Signed by the Ma&s;ters of the Ships, and to be atte&s;ted by the proper Officers admini&s;tring the &s;ame re&s;pectively.</CELL>
<CELL>The Law already requires the Oath and the making it more &s;olemn, by writing it down to be read and &s;ub&s;cribed, before &s;worn may procure a greater Regard of it.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>31. A Regular Account of all Seizures to be given from time to time to the Commi&s;&s;ioners.</CELL>
<CELL>The nece&s;&s;ary to prevent Di&s;charges with|out die Cour&s;e of Law.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>32. All Bonds duly Certified to be Cancelled, and the Certificate to be annexed to the Bond, to ju&s;tifie the Officer in Cancelling the &s;ame.</CELL>
<CELL>The pre&s;ent Practice, is to return the Bonds into the <HI>Exchequer</HI> without Cancelling; &s;o that if the Certificate happens to be lo&s;t, the Mer|chantis unrea&s;onably pro&s;ecuted.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>33. Bonds not duly Certified, to be re|turned regularly into the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> in or|der to a Pro&s;ecution.</CELL>
<CELL>This no le&s;s rea&s;onable than the other, to di&s;courage Irregular Practices.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>34. The Impo&s;itions to be accompted for in the <HI>Exchequer</HI> by the Patent-Officers in the Year-Books as well as the Sub&s;idy.</CELL>
<CELL>Tho&s;e Duties now amounting to more than the Old Sub&s;idy, may de&s;erve as much Care from the Officer in rendring a ju&s;t Account of then.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>35. Collectors to give in their Quarterly Accounts of Incidents upon Oath, and all Officers to attend diligently at rea&s;onable Hours the Di&s;patch of Merchants Bu&s;ine&s;s.</CELL>
<CELL>The fir&s;t Part but a rea&s;onable Caution from the Officer, and the other a ju&s;t Regard to the Accommodation of Trade.</CELL>
</ROW>
</TABLE></P>
<P>&V;pon the whole Matter, This Bill is of very Publick Concernment: For as there was in the Year ending at <HI>Michaelmas</HI> l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t near 1500000 <HI>l.</HI> in Money received for Duties at the <HI>Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e,</HI> and applied to the Di&s;charge of the Debt of the Nation, It is plain that a due Collection of the&s;e Duties does not only tend to en|courage Trade in General, but to ea&s;e the Land of every Gentleman in <HI>England</HI> of &s;o much of that Publick Burthen which mu&s;t otherwi&s;e come upon it. And if there be ony one Clau&s;e in the whole Bill, which upon due Deliberation &s;hall be found Impracticable or too Rigorous, the Bill being framed as it is by Rules to make it more intelligible in fewer Words, any one of them may be left out without Pre|judice to the re&s;t, as having no nece&s;&s;ary Dependance on, or Connexion with one another.</P>
