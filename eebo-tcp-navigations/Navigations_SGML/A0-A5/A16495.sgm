<HEAD>TO THE MOST EXCELLENT PRINCE.</HEAD>
<P>_THough you haue gra|ced the Labours of &s;ome (as much admi|red for your courte&s;ie as they for their in|di&s;cretion) who might haue beene condem|ned for pre&s;uming to importune you for their Patron; yet it would &s;eeme a prophanation of greatne&s;&s;e to place your name vpon the Fron|ti&s;pice of euery vulgar Paper, but as no Worke hath more need of your countenance, then the <HI>En|couraging of Colonies;</HI> So it would appeare to me (I know not &s;u&s;pecting my owne partiali|tie, whither &s;educed by De&s;ire, or warranted by Rea&s;on) that there is no ground whereupon your
<PB REF="4">countenance may &s;hine with a more publike ap|plau&s;e. This is the way (making the Go&s;pell of Ie&s;us Chri&s;t knowne in vnknowne parts) by &s;up|plying the nece&s;sities of many, with a lawfull in|crea&s;e of nece&s;&s;ary commerce, to procure glorie vnto God, honour to your &s;elfe, and benefit to the World; By this meanes, you that are borne to rule Nations, may bee the beginner of Nations, enlarging this Monarchie without bloud, and ma|king a Conque&s;t without wronging of others, whereof in regard of your youth any good begin|ning in this (like your vertue vpon which it doth defend) boding a &s;peedie Progre&s;&s;e Time in your own time, doth promi&s;e a great perfection. The glo|ry of greatnes (that it may haue a harmonie with goodne&s;&s;e) con&s;i&s;ting more in ray&s;ing then in rui|ning of others, it is a farre better cour&s;e to pur|cha&s;e fame by the Plantation of a new World, nor as many Princes haue done by the de&s;olation of this. And &s;ince your Royall Father during who&s;e happie raigne, the&s;e &s;eeds of Scepters haue beene fir&s;t from hence &s;owne in <HI>America,</HI> by his gracious fauour farre aboue any merit of mine hath emboldened mee the meane&s;t of many thou|&s;ands of his &s;ubiects to attempt &s;o great an Enter|prize, as to lay the foundation of a Worke that way &s;o much import the good of that ancient
<PB REF="4">Kingdome, where &s;o many of your&punc; Ance&s;tors were buried, and where your &s;elues were borne. I haue both by reading what doth re&s;t vpon Re|cord, and by conferring with &s;undry that haue beene imbarked in &s;uch a bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, beene curious to remarke the managing thereof, that the ex|perience of times pa&s;t might with the le&s;&s;e dan|ger at the charges of others, improoue them that are to practize at this pre&s;ent. And the fruits of my Labours I doe humbly offer heere vnto your Highne&s;&s;e, hoping by the commendable endeuours, therein remembred (though it &s;elfe be but a tri|uiall Treati&s;e, not worthy your &s;ight) to conci|liate your good opinion towards them that are to aduenture in this kind. Amongst whom (if euer my fortunes haue any conformitie with my mind) I purpo&s;e to contribute as much as my weake abi|lities can bee able to affoord for accompli&s;hing this braue De&s;igne, wherein my greate&s;t Ambi|tion &s;hall be that both this Age and the Po&s;teri|tie may know how much I de&s;ire by &s;ome ob&s;erua|ble effect to be remembred for being</P>

<HEAD>AN ENCOVRAGEMENT TO COLONIES.</HEAD>
<P>_THe &s;ending forth of Colo|nies (&s;eeming a nouelty) is e&s;teemed now to bee a &s;trange thing, as not one|ly being aboue the cou|rage of common men, but altogether alienated from their knowledge, which is no wonder, &s;ince that cour&s;e though both ancient, and v&s;uall, hath beene by the intermi&s;|&s;ion of &s;o many ages di&s;continued, yea was impo&s;sible to be practi&s;ed &s;o long as there was no va&s;t ground, how&s;o|euer men had beene willing, whereupon Plantations might haue beene made, yet there is none who will doubt but that the world in her infancy, and innocency, was fir&s;t peo|pled after this manner.</P>
<P>The next generations &s;ucceeding <HI>Shem</HI> planted in <HI>A&s;ia, Chams</HI> in <HI>Africke,</HI> and <HI>Iaphets</HI> in <HI>Europe: Abraham</HI> and <HI>Lot</HI> were Captaines of Colonies, the Land then being as free as the Seas are now, &s;ince they parted them in euery part where they pa&s;&s;ed, not taking notice of natiues with|out
<PB N="2" REF="8">impediment. That memorable troope of <HI>Iewes</HI> which <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> led from <HI>Aegypt</HI> to <HI>Canaan</HI> was a kind of Colonie though miraculou&s;ly conducted by God, who intended thereby to aduance his Church and to de&s;troy the rejected Ethnikes. <HI>Salmanezer</HI> King of <HI>A&s;hur</HI> was remarked for the fir&s;t who did violate the naturall ingenuitie of this com|mendable kind of policy by too politike an intention; for hauing tran&s;ported the ten Tribes <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> to the end that tran&s;planting and di&s;per&s;ing them, hee might either wea|ken their &s;trength, or aboli&s;h their memorie by incorpora|ting of them with his other Subjects; he to preuent the dangers incident among&s;t remote va&s;&s;als did &s;end a Colo|nie to inhabite <HI>Samaria</HI> of a purpo&s;e thereby to &s;ecure his late and que&s;tionable conque&s;t.</P>
<P>Who can imagine by this indu&s;trious cour&s;e of Planta|tions, what an vnexpected progre&s;&s;e from a de&s;pi&s;ed be|ginning hath beene &s;uddenly made to the height of great|ne&s;&s;e! The <HI>Phoenicians</HI> quickly founded <HI>Sidon,</HI> and <HI>Tirus,</HI> &s;o much renowned both by &s;acred, and humane writers, and a few <HI>Tirians</HI> builded <HI>Carthage,</HI> which had fir&s;t no more ground allowed her than could be compa&s;&s;ed by the extended dimen&s;ions of a Bulls hide, which for acquiring of the more ground they diuided in as many &s;undrie parts as was po&s;sible, yet in end that Town became the Mi&s;tre&s;&s;e of <HI>Afrike,</HI> and the riuall of <HI>Rome:</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> it &s;elfe that great Ladie of the World, and terrour to all Nations, am|bitiou&s;ly clayming for her fir&s;t founders a few &s;candali|zed fugitiues that fled from the ruines of <HI>Troy,</HI> did ri&s;e from &s;mall appearances to that exorbitancy of power, which at this day is remembred with admiration; Though the walls of it at that time were very lowe when the one bro|ther did kill the other for jumping ouer them, either jea|lou&s;ie already preuayling aboue naturall affection, or el&s;e vnadui&s;ed anger con&s;tructing that which might haue been ca&s;ually or carele&s;ly done, in a &s;mi&s;trous &s;en&s;e to the hate|full behauiour of in&s;olency or &s;corne; Their number then was not only very &s;mall, but they wanted women, with|out
<PB N="3" REF="8">which they could not encrea&s;e, nor &s;ub&s;i&s;t, till they ra|ni&s;hed the daughters of the <HI>Sabins,</HI> by a violent match at fir&s;t, portending their future rapins, and what a furious off-&s;pring they were likely to ingender. And when that haughty Citie beganne to &s;uffer the mi&s;eries which &s;he had &s;o long beene accu&s;tomed to inflict vpon others, the vene|rable Citie of <HI>Venice</HI> (keeping for &s;o many ages a &s;potle&s;&s;e reputation) was fir&s;t begunne by a few di&s;couraged per|&s;ons, who fleeing from the furie of the barbarous Nations that then encroached vpon <HI>Italie,</HI> were di&s;tracted with feare and (&s;eeking for their &s;afety) did &s;tumble vpon a commo|dious dwelling.</P>
<P>The <HI>Graecians</HI> were the fir&s;t, at lea&s;t of all the Gentiles, (who joyning learning with armes) did both doe, and write that which was worthie to be remembred; and that &s;mall parcel of ground who&s;e greatne&s;&s;e was then only va|lued by the vertue of the inhabitants, did plant <HI>Trapizonde</HI> in the Ea&s;t, and many other Cities in <HI>A&s;ia</HI> the le&s;&s;e, the protecting of who&s;e liberties was the fir&s;t cau&s;e of warre between them and the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Monarchs; then be&s;ides all the adjacent Iles they planted <HI>Siracu&s;a</HI> in <HI>Sicile,</HI> mo&s;t part of <HI>Italie,</HI> which made it to bee called <HI>Gracia maior,</HI> and <HI>Mar&s;eills</HI> in <HI>France.</HI> O what a &s;trange alteration! that this part, which did flouri&s;h thus, while&s;t it was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by vigorous &s;pirits, who were capable of great enterpri&s;es, did &s;o many braue things &s;hould now (the &s;eate of ba&s;e &s;eruile people) become the mo&s;t abject and contemptible part of all the Territories belonging to the .barbarous <HI>Ottomans,</HI> who&s;e in&s;olent Iani&s;&s;aries (as the Pretorian Guards did with their Emperours, and Mamalukes of <HI>Egypt</HI> with their Soldans) pre&s;ume at this time to di&s;po&s;e of the Regall power, vpbrayding the mi&s;erable follie of Chri&s;tians, who dangerou&s;ly embarqued in inte&s;tine warres, though inui|ted by an encountring occa&s;ion, neglect &s;o great, &s;o glo|rious, and &s;o ea&s;ie a conque&s;t.</P>
<P>The <HI>Romanes</HI> comming to command a well peopled World, had no u&s;e of Colonies, but onely thereby to re|ward
<PB N="4" REF="9">&s;uch old de&s;eruing Souldiers as (age and merit plea|ding an immunitie from any further con&s;trained trauell) had brauely exceeded the ordinary cour&s;e of time appoin|ted for military &s;eruice, which cu&s;tome was v&s;ed in <HI>Germa|nie, France, Spaine,</HI> and <HI>Brittaine,</HI> and likewi&s;e that the Townes erected in this &s;ort might &s;erue for Citadels impo|&s;ed vpon euery conquered Prouince, whereof &s;ome doe flouri&s;h at this day, and of others nothing doth remaine but the very name onely, their ruines being &s;o ruined, that wee can hardly condiscend vpon what &s;olitary part to be|&s;towe the fame of their former being.</P>
<P>I am loth by di&s;putable opinions to dig vp the Tombes of them that more extenuated then the du&s;t are buried in obliuion &amp; will leaue the&s;e di&s;regarded relicts of greatne&s;&s;e to continue as they are, the &s;cornc of pride, witne&s;sing the power of time. Neither will I after the common cu&s;tome of the world, ouerualuing things pa&s;t di&s;ualue the pre&s;ent, but con&s;idering &s;eriou&s;ly of that which is lately done in <HI>Ireland,</HI> doe finde a Plantation there inferiour to none that hath beene heretofore. The <HI>Babylonians</HI> hauing conque|red the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> did tran&s;plant them as expo&s;ed to ruine in a remote Countrey, &s;ending others of their owne Na|tion (that they might be vtterly extirpated) to inhabite <HI>Sa|m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ria</HI> in their places. And our King hath only diuided the mo&s;t &s;editious families of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> by di&s;per&s;ing them in &s;undry parts within the Countrey, not to extingui&s;h, but to di&s;sipate their power, who now neither haue, nor giue cau&s;e of feare. The <HI>Romanes</HI> did build &s;ome Townes which they did plant with their owne people by all rigour to curbe the Natiues next adjacent thereunto, And our King hath incorporated &s;ome of his be&s;t <HI>Brittaines</HI> with the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> planted in &s;undry places without power to op|pre&s;&s;e, but onely to ciuilize them by their example. Thus <HI>Ireland</HI> which heretofore was &s;carcely di&s;couered, and on|ly irritated by others, prouing to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> as the <HI>Lowe-Countries</HI> did to <HI>Spaine,</HI> a meanes whereby to wa&s;te their men, and their money, is now really conquered, becom|ming
<PB N="5" REF="9">a &s;trength to the State, and a glorie to his Maje&s;ties gouernment, who hath in the &s;etling thereof excelled all that was commended in any ancient Colonie.</P>
<P>As all fir&s;t were encouraged to Plantations by the large|ne&s;&s;e of the conque&s;ts that were propo&s;ed vnto them, fea|ring onely want of people, and not of. land, &s;o in after ages when all knowne parts became peopled, they were quickly entangled with the other extremitie, grudging to be boun|ded within their pro&s;pect, and jarring with their neigh|bours for &s;mall parcels of ground, a &s;trife for limits limi|ting the liues of many who entring fir&s;t in controuer&s;ie vpon a point of profit though with the lo&s;&s;e of ten times more, valuing their honour by the opinion of others be|hooued to proceed as engaged for the &s;afety of their repu|tation. Then riche&s;&s;e being acquired by indu&s;trie, and glo|rie by employments, the&s;e two did beget auarice, and am|bition, which lodging in &s;ome &s;ubtile heads vpon a poli|tike con&s;ideration to vnite inte&s;tine diui&s;ions did transferre their &s;plene to forraine parts, not &s;eeking to rectifie the af|fections, but to bu&s;ie them abroad where lea&s;t harme was feared, and mo&s;t benefit expected, &s;o that where they had fir&s;t in a peaceable &s;ort &s;ought for Lands onely wherewith to furni&s;h their nece&s;sity, which conueniency, or &s;ufficien|cy, did ea&s;ily accommodate, now ayming at greatne&s;&s;e the de&s;ires of men growne infinite, made them &s;trangers to contentment, and enemies to re&s;t.</P>
<P>Some Nations &s;eeking to exchange for better &s;eates, o|thers to command their neighbours, there was for many ages no &s;peach but of wrongs and reuenges, conque&s;ts and reuolts, razings and ruining of States, a continuall reuolu|tion determining the periods of Time by the mi&s;eries of mankind, and in regard of the populou&s;ne&s;&s;e of the&s;e ages during the Monarchies of the <HI>A&s;&s;irians, Per&s;ians, Graecians,</HI> and <HI>Romanes,</HI> the world could not haue &s;ub&s;i&s;ted if it had not beene purged of turbulent humours by letting out the bloud of many thou&s;ands, &s;o that warre was the vniuer&s;all Chirurgeon of the&s;e di&s;tempered times: And thereafter
<PB N="6" REF="10">O what mon&s;trous multitudes of people were &s;laine by huge deluges of barbarous armies that ouerflowed <HI>Italie, France</HI> and <HI>Spaine!</HI> and the Chri&s;tians haue long beene &s;ubject to the like calamities wanting a commoditie how they might (not wronging others) in a Chri&s;tian manner employ the people that were more chargeable then nece&s;&s;ary at home, which was the cau&s;e of much mi&s;|chiefe among them&s;elues, till at that time when <HI>Spaine</HI> was &s;triuing with <HI>France</HI> how to part <HI>Italie,</HI> as <HI>Italie</HI> had formerly done with <HI>Carthage</HI> how to part <HI>Spaine.</HI> Then is plea&s;ed God hauing pitie of the Chri&s;tians who for pur|po&s;e of &s;mall importance did prodigally pro&s;titute the liues of them whom hee had purcha&s;ed with &s;o precious a ran&s;ome, as it were for diuerting that violent kind of vani|tie, to di&s;couer a new world, which it would &s;eeme in all rea&s;on &s;hould haue tran&s;ported them with de&s;ignes of more moment, whereby glory and profit with a guiltle&s;&s;e labour was to bee attayned with le&s;&s;e danger whereunto they are as it were inuited, and prouoked with &s;o many e|minent aduantages palpably expo&s;ed to any cleare judge|ment that I thinke (this obuious facilitie vilifying that which a further difficulty might the more endeare) the ea&s;ine&s;&s;e of the prey hath blunted the appetite.</P>
<P>When <HI>Chri&s;topher Columbus</HI> had in vaine propounded this enterpri&s;e to diuers Chri&s;tian Princes, <HI>I&s;abella</HI> of <HI>Ca|&s;tile</HI> again&s;t the opinion of her husband (though &s;o much renowned for wit yet not reaching this my&s;terie) did fir&s;t furni&s;h him for a Voyage, as if it were fatall that that Na|tion &s;hould owe the greate&s;t part of their greatne&s;&s;e to the female Sexe, And if the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would &s;incerely, and gratefully haue be&s;towed the benefits whereby God did al|lure them to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e this Land for the planting of it with Chri&s;tians enclined to ciuilitie, and religion, it had at this day con&s;idering the excellency of the &s;oyle, for all the per|fections that nature could afford; beene the mo&s;t &s;ingu|larly accompli&s;hed place of the world, but it hath infortu|natly fallen out farre otherwi&s;e, that the mea&s;ures that are
<PB N="7" REF="10">drawne from thence (mynes to blowe vp mindes and rockes to ruine faith) doe proue the &s;eed of di&s;&s;ention, the &s;inewes of the warre, and nurcerie of all the troubles a|mong&s;t Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> that were &s;o happie as to chance fir&s;t vp|on this new World, were of all others (hauing but a va&s;t mountainous Countrey) in regard of their &s;carcity of peo|ple mo&s;t vnfit for planting thereof, and could not but &s;oone haue abandoned the &s;ame, if they had not &s;o quick|ly encountred with the rich Mynes of <HI>Mexico, New Spaine</HI> and <HI>Peru</HI> which were once likely to haue beene lo&s;t for lacke of wood, till the way was inuented of refining Sil|uer by quick&s;iluer, which may bee ea&s;ily done out of any oare that is free from Lead, and (all the <HI>Spaniards</HI> di&s;day|ning worke as a &s;eruile thing belowe their abilities) their greate&s;t trouble is the want of workmen: for the Natiues that are extant, &s;uruiuing many vexations, if they become ciuile out of an indulgency to libertie, and ea&s;e, whereun|to all the <HI>Americans</HI> (liking better of a penurious life thus then to haue plenty with taking paines) are naturally encli|ned, that they may haue a &s;ecure ea&s;e warranted by an or|der doe betake them&s;elues to Cloi&s;ters, &s;o that they haue no meanes to pro&s;ecute the&s;e workes but by drawing yeer|ly a great number of <HI>Negroes</HI> from <HI>Angola,</HI> and other parts, which being but an vnnaturall merchandi&s;e, are bought at a deare rate, and maintayned with danger, for they once of late, as I haue heard from one that was there at that time de&s;igned to murther their Ma&s;ters, by a plot which &s;hould haue beene put in execution vpon a Good-friday, when all being exerci&s;ed at their deuotion were lea&s;t apt to apprehend &s;uch a wicked cour&s;e, and it is alwaies feared that to reuenge what of nece&s;sitie they mu&s;t &s;uffer, and to procure their libertie hating mo&s;t what they feele for the pre&s;ent, and hoping for better by a change, they will joyne with any &s;trong enemy that landing there dare attempt the conque&s;t of that Countrey.</P>
<P>I will not here in&s;i&s;t in &s;etting downe the manned how
<PB N="8" REF="11">the <HI>Spaniards</HI> made them&s;elues Ma&s;ters of &s;o many rich and plea&s;ant Countries, but doe leaue that to their owne Hi&s;tories, though I confe&s;&s;e (like wi&s;emen) they are very &s;paring to report the e&s;tate of the&s;e parts, and doe barre all &s;trangers from hauing acce&s;&s;e thereunto, wi&s;hing to enjoy that which they loue in priuate, and not incon&s;iderately vanting by the vanitie of prai&s;es to procure vnto them|&s;elues the vexation that they might &s;uffer by the earne&s;t pur&s;uit of emulating riuals, but as they did brauely begin, and re&s;olutely pro&s;ecute their Di&s;coueries in <HI>America,</HI> &s;o hath it ju&s;tly recompenced their courage, prouing the ground of all that greatne&s;&s;e which this time (not with|out cau&s;e) doth make them (as able, or willing, to conquer others if not both) &s;o much &s;u&s;pected by euery jealous State. And <HI>Henry</HI> the Seuenth the <HI>Salomon</HI> of <HI>England</HI> had his judgement onely condemned for neglecting that good occa&s;ion which was fir&s;t offered vnto him by <HI>Colum|bus,</HI> yet did he pre&s;ently &s;eeke to repaire his errour by &s;en|ding forth <HI>Seba&s;tian Chabot</HI> a <HI>Venetian</HI> who did di&s;couer the Ile of <HI>Newfound-land,</HI> and this part of the Continent of <HI>America</HI> now intended to bee planted by his Maje&s;ties Subjects vnder the name of New <HI>England,</HI> and New <HI>Scot|land,</HI> &s;o that the fruits of his happie raigue &s;till growing to a greater perfection and now ripe to bee gathered by this age, as he made way by the marriage of his elde&s;t daugh|ter for vniting the&s;e two Nations at home, &s;o did hee the &s;ame likewi&s;e by this di&s;couerie abroad, but the accom|pli&s;hment of both was re&s;erued for his Maje&s;tie now raign|ing, and no Prince in the world may more ea&s;ily effectuate &s;uch a purpo&s;e &s;ince his Dominions affoord abundance of braue men &s;ingularly valued for able bodies and actiue &s;pi|rits whereof the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> haue already giuen good proofe of their &s;ufficiency in forraine Plantations; but before I proceed further in that which doth concerne them I mu&s;t ob&s;erue what the <HI>French</HI> haue done in this kind.</P>

<P>And it is a thing not yet comprehended by the cour&s;e of naturall rea&s;on, how the&s;e parts of the World came fir&s;t to be peopled: We mu&s;t grant (according to the grounds of Diuinitie) their people to be de&s;cended from <HI>Noah,</HI> and it is not long &s;ince that (the Load&s;tone being found out) the be&s;t Saylers (&s;corning as in fomer times to be only coa&s;ters) haue broutht the Art of Nauigation to that perfection, that they dur&s;t re&s;olutely aduenture to &s;earch the mo&s;t remote

<P>But the thing mo&s;t wonderfull of all is this, though now it bee cleerely di&s;couered, that &s;o few are willing to make v&s;e therof; This doth chiefly proceed from want of know|ledge, few being willing to aduenture vpon that where|with they are not acquainted by their owne experience, and yet tho&s;e who haue not made triall them&s;elues, if they will tru&s;t others, may bee abundantly &s;atisfied by the re|ports of a number, who to Plant and Traffique doe yeerely

<PB N="44" REF="30">But leauing the&s;e worldly re&s;pects, the greate&s;t incouragement of all for any true Chri&s;tian is this, that heere is a large way for aduancing the Go&s;pel of Ie&s;us Chri&s;t, to whom Churches may bee builded in places where his Name was neuer knowne; and if the Saints of Heauen reioyce at the conuer&s;ion of a Sinner, what exceeding ioy would it bee to them to &s;ee many thou|&s;ands of Sauage people (who doe now liue like brute bea&s;ts) conuerted vnto God, and I wi&s;h (leauing the&s;e dreames of Honour and Profit, which doe intoxicate the braines, and impoy&s;on the minde with tran&s;itory plea&s;ures) that this might bee our chiefe end to be|gin a new life, &s;eruing God more &s;incerely then before, to whom we may draw more neere, by retyring our &s;elues fur|ther from hence.</P>
<P>As I would haue no man that hath a mind for this cour&s;e, to abu&s;e his iudgement, by tru&s;ting too much to the ferti|litie of the bounds where he is to goe, and too little to his owne prouidence, and indu&s;trie, whereby he may be made to neglect the preparing himm&s;elfe for this Voyage after &s;uch a manner as is requi&s;ite, So I altogether di&s;like them that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the prepo&s;terous apprehen&s;ions of feare (like the lazie man of whome <HI>Salomon</HI> &s;peaketh, that pretending difficulties to preuent trauell, would &s;ay there was a Lion in the way) will needs imagine the wor&s;t that is in po&s;&s;ibilitie to happen: for &s;uch a man (too inge|niou&s;ly &s;ubtill in coniecturing danger) doth both by pre|iudicated opinions di&s;able him&s;elfe, and di&s;courage them, who not being duely informed, are confirmed by the con|fidence of other vndertakers, that profe&s;&s;e to haue know|ledge, there is no man at home where he was borne, &s;o free from the accidents of fortune who may not quickly by a publike, or by a priuate calamitie be brought in &s;ome mea|&s;ure to &s;uffer, and much rather &s;hould wee arme our &s;elues with a high re&s;olution again&s;t all inconueniences that can occurre in &s;uch a forraine enterpri&s;e (being circum&s;pectly
