<OPENER><SALUTE>May it plea&s;e your Maje&s;tie,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_YOur Maje&s;ties mo&s;t loyall, and faith|full Subjects, the Lords and Com|mons in Parliament have duly con|&s;idered the Me&s;&s;age received from your Maje&s;ty, concerning your pur|po&s;e of going into <HI>Ireland</HI> in your own per&s;on to pro&s;ecute the warre there with the bodies of your <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Subjects levied, tran&s;ported, and mayntained at their charge, which you are plea|&s;ed to propound to us, not as a matter wherein your Maje&s;ty de&s;ires the advice of your Parliament, but as already firmely re&s;olved on, and forthwith to be put in execution, by granting out Commi&s;|&s;ions for the levying of two thou&s;and foot, and two hundred Hor&s;e for a Guard for your per|&s;on when you &s;hall come into that Kingdome, wherein we cannot chu&s;e but withall reverence and humility to your Maje&s;ty, ob&s;erve that you have declined your great Councell the Parliament, and varied from the u&s;uall cour&s;e of your Royall Prede|ce&s;&s;ors, that a bu&s;ine&s;&s;e of &s;o great importance con|cerning the peace and &s;afety of all your Subjects, and wherein they have a &s;peciall intere&s;t by your Maje&s;ties promi&s;e, and by tho&s;e great &s;ums which
<PB N="2" REF="3">they have disbur&s;ed, and for which they &s;tand in|gaged &s;hould be concluded and undertaken without their advice, whereupon we hold it our duty to de|clare, that if at this time your Maje&s;ty &s;hall goe into <HI>Ireland,</HI> you will very much endanger the &s;afety of your Royall Per&s;on and Kingdoms, and of all other States profe&s;&s;ing the Prote&s;tant Religion in Chri|&s;tendome, and make way to that cruell, and bloudy De&s;igne of the Papi&s;ts every where to root out and de&s;troy the Reformed Religion as the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Papi&s;ts have in a great part already effected in that King|dome and in all likelyhood would quickly be at|tempted in other places, if the con&s;ideration of the &s;trength and union of the two Nations of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> did not much hinder, and di&s;courage the execution of any &s;uch de&s;igne, and that we may manife&s;t to your Maje&s;tie, the danger and mi&s;ery, which &s;uch a journey and enterprize would procure we pre&s;ent to your Maje&s;ty the Rea&s;ons of this our humble opinion, and advice.</P>
<P N="1">1 YOur Royall per&s;on will be &s;ubject not one|ly to the ca&s;ualty of warre, but to &s;ecret pra|cti&s;es, and con&s;piracies e&s;pecially your Maje&s;ty continuing your profe&s;sion to mayntaine the Pro|te&s;tant Religion in that Kingdome which the Pa|pi&s;ts are generally bound by their vow to extirpate.</P>
<P N="2">2 It will exceedingly encourage the Rebels who doe generally profe&s;&s;e, and declare that your Ma|je&s;ty doth favour and allow their proceedings, and this in&s;urrection was undertaken by the warrant of your Commi&s;sion, and it will make good their ex|pectation of great advantage by your Maje&s;ties pre|&s;ence
<PB N="3" REF="3">at this time of &s;o much di&s;traction in this King|dome, whereby they may hope we &s;hall be di&s;abled to &s;upply the warre there, e&s;pecially there appearing le&s;&s;e nece&s;&s;itie of your Maje&s;ties Journey at this time, by rea&s;on of the manifold &s;ucce&s;&s;es which God hath given again&s;t them.</P>
<P N="3">3. It will much hinder and impaire the meanes, whereby this warre is to bee &s;upported, and will encrea&s;e the charge of it, and in both the&s;e re&s;pects, make it more in&s;upportable to your Subjects: and this we can confidently affirme, becau&s;e many of the Adventurers who have already &s;ub&s;cri|bed, doe upon the knowledge of your Maje&s;ties In|tentions, declare their re&s;olutions, not to pay in their money, and others very willing to have &s;ub&s;cribed, doe now profe&s;&s;e the contrary.</P>
<P N="4">4. Your Maje&s;ties ab&s;ence mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily very much interrupt the proceedings of Parliament, and deprive your Subjects of the benefit of tho&s;e further Acts of Grace, and Ju&s;tice which we &s;hall humbly expect from your Maje&s;ty for the e&s;tabli&s;hing of per|fect union, and mutuall confidence betwixt your Ma|je&s;ty and your People, and procuring and confirming the pro&s;perity and happine&s;&s;e of both.</P>
<P N="5">5. It will exceedingly encrea&s;e the jealou&s;ies and feares of your people, and render the doubts of your Subjects more probable, of &s;ome force intended by &s;ome evill coun&s;ells neere your Maje&s;ty, in oppo&s;iti|on to the Parliament, and favour of the malignant party of the Kingdome.</P>
<P N="6">6. It will bereave your Parliament of that advan|tage, whereby they were induced to undertake this
<PB N="4" REF="4">warre upon your Maje&s;ties promi&s;e, that it &s;hould be managed by their advice, which cannot be done, if your Maje&s;tie contrary to their Coun&s;ell &s;hall under|take to order and governe it in your owne Per&s;on.</P>
<P>Upon which and divers other rea&s;ons wee have re|&s;olved by the full and concurring agreement of both Hou&s;es, that we cannot with the dutie which belongs to us, con&s;ent to any Levyes, or rai&s;ing of Souldiours to be made by your Maje&s;ty, for this your intended expedition into <HI>Ireland,</HI> or to the payment of any Army or Souldiers there, but &s;uch as &s;hall bee im|ployed and governed according to our advice and di|rection, and that if &s;uch Levyes &s;hall be made by any Commi&s;&s;ion of your Maje&s;ty, not agreed to by both Hou&s;es of Parliament, wee &s;hall be forced to inter|pret the &s;ame to be ray&s;ed to the terrour of your peo|ple, and di&s;turbance of the publicke peace, and hold our &s;elves bound by the Lawes of the Kingdome, to apply the authority of Parliament to &s;uppre&s;&s;e the &s;ame.</P>
<P>And we doe further mo&s;t humbly declare, that if your Maje&s;ty &s;hall by ill coun&s;ell, be per&s;waded to goe contrary to this advice of your Parliament (which we hope your Maje&s;ty will not, We doe not in that ca&s;e hold our &s;elves bound to &s;ubmit to any Commi&s;&s;ioners, which your Maje&s;ty &s;hall choo&s;e, but doe re&s;olve to pre&s;erve and governe the King|dome by the coun&s;ell and advice of Parliament for your Maje&s;tie and your Po&s;teritie according to Alle|giance, and the Law of the Land.</P>
<P>Wherefore we mo&s;t humbly pray, and advi&s;e your Maje&s;ty, to de&s;i&s;t from this your intended pa&s;&s;age
<PB N="5" REF="4">into <HI>Ireland,</HI> and from all preparation of men and Armes tending thereunto, and to leave the managing of that warre to your Parliament, according to your Maje&s;ties promi&s;e made unto us and your Royall Commi&s;&s;ion granted under your great Seale of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> by advi&s;e of both Hou&s;es, in pro&s;ecution where|of, by Gods ble&s;&s;ing we have made a pro&s;perous en|trance by many defeats of the Rebels, whereby they are much weakned and di&s;-heartened, and have no probable meanes of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, if our proceedings &s;hall not be interrupted by this interpo&s;ition of your Maje&s;ties J urney, but that we may hope upon good grounds, that within a &s;hort time, without hazard of your Maje&s;ties per&s;on, and &s;o much dangerous con|fu&s;ion to your Kingdomes, which mu&s;t needs en&s;ue if you &s;hould proceed in this re&s;olution: We &s;hall be enabled fully to vindicate your Maje&s;ties right and authority in that Kingdome, and puni&s;h tho&s;e horri|ble and outragious cruelties which have bin commit|ted in the murthering, and &s;poyling &s;o many of your Subjects, and bring that Realme to &s;uch a Con|dition as may be much for the advantage of your Ma|je&s;ty, and this Crown, the honour of your government and contentment of your people, for the better, and more &s;peedy effecting whereof we doe againe renew our humble de&s;ires of your returne to your Parlia|ment. And that you will plea&s;e to reject all Coun|&s;els, and apprehen&s;ions which may any way derogate from that faithfulne&s;&s;e, and Allegiance which in truth and &s;inceritie we have alwayes borne, and pro|fe&s;&s;ed to your Maje&s;ty, and &s;hall ever make good to the uttermo&s;t with our lives and fortunes.</P>
