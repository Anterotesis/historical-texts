<HEAD>MEMOIRS OF Capt. James Whitney, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>TO Commence our Hi&s;tory from the very Birth of our <HI>Hero,</HI> the Subject of our pre&s;ent Treati&s;e, he de&s;cended from very bumble Parentage, being born near <HI>Hitchin:</HI> About the Age of 14 he was put Apprentice to a <HI>Butcher</HI> at <HI>Che&s;&s;on,</HI> in <HI>Hertford&s;hire;</HI> but before he had half &s;erved his time, being too Ma&s;terly for a Servant, and having a Natural A|ver&s;ion to &s;o &s;ordid a Profe&s;&s;ion, his higher Thoughts led him to a contemptible Opinion of at lea&s;t &s;o &s;lovenly an Occupa|tion of Throat-cutting, po&s;&s;ibly fancying him&s;elf Capacitated for more manly Attacks than upon Tame Heifers and blearing Sheep, in&s;omuch that he got loo&s;e from that Subjection by con|&s;ent of all &s;ides; and then Marrying a Countrywoman there|about, he took the <HI>Bear Inn</HI> in <HI>Che&s;&s;on.</HI> In this Po&s;t his Fortune was no ways an&s;werable to his Expectation, our Hero found not half. Trade enough to make the Pot Boyl; till 'twas ob&s;erved that once in four or five Days a Jolly Troop of well Mounted Gallants wou'd vi&s;it his Hou&s;e, and by &s;pending and Revelling at a very high rate, make a little amends for the &s;low doings all the Week be&s;ides. 'Twas thought that this Jovial Gang laid the fir&s;t Foundation of his Ambition in Emulating tho&s;e Gay Examples; and thence a&s;piring to the Mercurial Life of a Rover and Son of Fortune. For very &s;oon after, our Spigget Merchant made his Abdication from <HI>Che&s;&s;on,</HI> for farther Walks abroad, and bolder Adventures. Now his poor Dome&s;tick Hou&s;hold-&s;tuff, his Wife, as trouble&s;ome Lumber was dropt at a poor cott near <HI>Enf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ild;</HI> where neverthele&s;s, though his now more elevated Gentleman Appetite di&s;dained the De&s;picable cour&s;e Fare of an homely Mattimon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">al Di&s;h, as dayly Fea&s;ting
<PB N="2" REF="3">and Rioting upon the variety of Gay Mi&s;&s;es, and <HI>Lond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">n</HI> Dames; however he took that care as now and then to drop a <HI>Guinea</HI> in his Travels to Melancholly Spou&s;e at home; and in fine, to keep her Hou&s;e over her Head, and Bread in Cupboard. I am the more &s;hort in this Part of our Sory, as that &s;everal little Pamphlets, already peep'd abroad, have been more prolix in this part of his Life, and therefore I &s;hall not treat my Reader with &s;o in&s;ipid a Repetition. Nor &s;hall I make it my Bu&s;ine&s;s to Enumerate every particular gro&s;&s;er Robbery, which affording little Matter more than the rough Compliment of <HI>Stand and De|liver,</HI> would con&s;equently make but a dull and undiverti&s;ing Narration, &s;uch as the Robbing the <HI>Lanca&s;hire</HI> Carrier, his Butchery of the poor Hor&s;es at <HI>Mimms Wa&s;h,</HI> or any other of his heavyer Feats of Activity, as the tire&s;ome Pamphleteers upon the &s;ame Subject have fooli&s;hly done before me. No, the de&s;ign of this Treati&s;e is only to &s;elect tho&s;e more Intriguing and more Comical Rencounters of his, of which kind near four years Reign of his cannot want Variety; and thereby make my Reader a more plea&s;ant Entertainment.</P>
<P>To return therefore to our Captain, and &s;horten the Satur|nine part of our Hi&s;tory. I &s;hall only inform you that to qua|lify him for this re&s;olute Imployment, he was one of the great|e&s;t Dear-&s;tealers in the Nation, an excerci&s;e highly in fa&s;hion with him in his very Prenti&s;hip; and a very good Initiation to him for the Hazards and Hardine&s;s of the Highway. In the beginning of his performance for &s;ome con&s;iderable while he excerci&s;ed his Prowe&s;s in Robbing alone. But when Time had laid Honour and Reputation upon his Back, a great many young Adventurers were proud of Li&s;ting under &s;o brisk a Lea|der, and the Jolly Troop increa&s;ing he acquired the honourable Title of Capt. <HI>Whitney.</HI> And now notwith&s;tanding I have &s;ought and received the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial Authority for the Cre|dit and Truth of the following Narrations; however, I have not tyed my &s;elf up to that nicety, as to be too critical in the ex|act order and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of his Exploits, that difficult and need|le&s;s Information is more than our Subject requires, or my Rea|der may expect; as to all other. Points we value our &s;elves up|on playing the Faithful Hi&s;torian.</P>
<P>But before I proceed to our Hi&s;tory, I &s;hall only tell you that his fir&s;t De&s;ertion of his Inn-keeping, was on this occa&s;ion: One of the Gang of his high-flown Gue&s;ts being Apprehended about four years &s;ince for &s;u&s;picion of Robbery, his kind Ho&s;t was plea&s;ed to offer him&s;elf and another Man, a pretended <HI>Londoner,</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="3">to be his Bayl before Sir <HI>H&mdash;G&mdash;</HI> a worthy Ju&s;tice of Peace of <HI>Hartford&s;hire;</HI> but Se&s;&s;ions &s;oon after Drawing on, the Principal and both the Seconds, all three of the Birds were fairly flown, and from that day the Captain was no farther &s;een or heard of thereabouts, but in the Fame and Trumpets of his publick Atcheivements, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And &s;o to come to our Memoirs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Being one Evening alone upon the Parade near <HI>Newbery,</HI> he over took a good Motherly neat Country woman, and a very Pretty young Creature her Daughter, both indifferently Mount|ed, and in very deep Tears and Lamentation. The Captain could not forbear looking with a great deal of Compa&s;&s;ion up|on the Sweetne&s;s and Innocence of the young Dam&s;el, e&s;pecially in that wayling condition. And hereupon (tho indeed already &s;u&s;pecting the Cau&s;e) he asked the occa&s;ion of &s;o much &s;awcy &s;orrow, that dur&s;t give &s;o violent a Di&s;turbance to the &s;weet Eyes of &s;o pretty a Creature. The Mother, of the two, being the readier with an An&s;wer, immediately told him, <HI>That her &s;elf and her Daughter had been mo&s;t inhumanly Rob'd of the &s;um of forty Pounds, that they were both utterly undone, for that very Money was her Daughters Portion, the all in the whole World &s;he had to give her, and that to morrow &s;he was to have been Marryed to a very hone&s;t Countryman, a Mealman, near</HI> Newbery, <HI>that had long Wooed her; and that now the Lo&s;s of the Money would not only undoubtedly break off the Match, but likewi&s;e be the utter inevitable Ruine of her poor mi&s;erable Child.</HI> The Captain, who pre&s;ently &s;melt the Rat, and was partly &s;a|tisfied which of his Gang had done this Execution; neverthe|le&s;s felt a great deal of tenderne&s;s for the Afflicted Dam&s;el, and endeavour'd to pacify both Mother and Daughter, by telling them, <HI>That the Bridegroom intended, could never be &s;uch a Barbarian &s;ure, as to de&s;ert his contracted Bride for what was her Misfortune, not her Fault. That con&s;idering the Beauty and Charms of &s;o pretty a Crea|ture he was going to po&s;&s;e&s;s certainly &s;o poor a Trifle as the incon&s;iderable Sum of Forty Pounds, would break no &s;quares, nor make any Bars to either of their Happine&s;s. Alas,</HI> replyed the Mother, <HI>you are a Gentleman, and I &s;uppo&s;e a Man of an E&s;tate, and forty Pounds may be little in yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters"> Pocket, but truly, 'tis a great &s;um in a poor Countryman's Pur&s;e. A Pox of Mony</HI> (replyed the Captain, interrupting her) <HI>does not he Love her? Ay, Sir,</HI> rep'yed the Young Virgin, <HI>He does Love me, and heartily too, otherwi&s;e I &s;hould not be &s;uch a fooli&s;h Crea|ture as to Sacrifice my whole Life to a man that did not Love me. But, alas, Sir, you Courteirs and Gallants have a great deal higher Notions of Love, than poor Country Folks; Love with us mu&s;t have Conveni|ence</HI> go along with it. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">d as much Beauty and Charms
<PB N="4" REF="4">and other fine things, as you are plea&s;ed to lay to my Charge, if my Portion be to &s;eek, I may go &s;eek for a Husband too. A great deale of Di&s;cour&s;e pa&s;t more upon the &s;ame Subject, but to come to Bu&s;ine&s;s, the Captain offered to Inn with them at <HI>Newberry,</HI> and wait the Lovers intended Vi&s;it next Morning, (as he under&s;tood he was to meet 'em there) and &s;ee what per|&s;wading Influence he could have over him, or at lea&s;t what he would propo&s;e towards making an Accommodation in this bu&s;ine&s;s. They accepted the Gentlemans kind offer, tho with very little hopes of &s;ucce&s;s from it, for they were pretty well a&s;&s;ured that a few kind pacyfying words, for that was the mo&s;t they could expect from a Stranger, would do bur little in &s;o important a Negotiation. As they travelled &s;oberly towards the Town, the Captain de&s;ired them to make no Noi&s;e of their Lo&s;s at the Inn, but hu&s;h their Misfortunes for &s;ome Rea&s;ons he would give them there: As they travelled along the old woman told him how they had been at <HI>London,</HI> to fetch this mony from a Friend, in who&s;e hands it had been Lodged there for her Childs &s;ake, and afterwards gave him a long Relation of her own Family and her Affairs, in which there was nothing worth the Captains remembrance, except a very comical de|&s;cription of the hard Labour &s;he had with this poor Girl to bring her into the World, and the harder Labour &s;he had to Nur&s;e her up.</P>
<P>When they came to the Inn, the matter was di&s;cu&s;s'd over again, where 'twas urged, that the Husband de&s;ign'd was a wa|ry thrifty Man, and would no more Marry a Beggar tho with all the Charms of an <HI>Arch Angel,</HI> then he would build Churches. And in &s;hort, nothing but Ruine and De&s;pair lay before 'em, for truly the Girle did very much love him, and really had cau&s;e for it, for he had wooed her 2 whole years to|gether, with all the Pa&s;&s;ion and Faith imaginable, and more to that purpo&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Captain by this Time, mightily &s;mitten with the young Bride, very frankly offered to lay down the 40 <HI>l.</HI> which he had in Gold about him, to make up the Portion, and reconcile the Lovers. They were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">oth a&s;to|ni&s;ht at this &s;urprizing Goodne&s;s, and could not really believe him in Earne&s;t in &s;o great a Favour, unle&s;s he had &s;ome hard Terms to joyn with it, and therein they were not deceived, for truly the Captain in all the in&s;inuating &s;mooth Language he could dre&s;s it, told 'em that he would not lend, but pre|&s;ent her with the Money, for to lend it, as that he might do, and force her Husband to pay it afterwards, would
<PB N="5" REF="4">not only be a very great hard&s;hip upon him, but po&s;&s;ibly make a great fraction in their Peace, and rai&s;e an irreconcileable Fewd betwixt Man and Wife; no, he would accommodate her on much gentler Terms; what Returne he expected, (as really he could not but be &s;o much mercinary) was the happi|ne&s;s of this one Nights Lodging with the Bride. The Mother and Daughter, as you may well imagine, were highly &s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">tled at &s;uch a Propo&s;al, which the Capt. had no ways to excu&s;e, but by urging the &s;trange hold that this young Creature, tho in &s;o &s;hort a Conver&s;ation, had got upon his Heart, with a 100 more pa&s;&s;ionate Expre&s;&s;ions upon &s;o tender a theme to the &s;ame amo|rous tune. A very great flood of Tears followed from the fair Eyes at &s;o har&s;h a motion: but to draw matters to a point, and omit the Arguments bandyed on both &s;ides; the lo&s;s of a Hus|band, the lo&s;s of a Fortune, and indeed all the poor Girls ex|pectation in this World, were &s;uch potent con&s;iderations, that in fine, to repair &s;o fatal a Breach, as this Gentlemans kind 40 <HI>l.</HI> would re-cement, the Mothers heart beginning to molly&s;y fir&s;t, &s;he could not, though with much Regret, but yeild. And truly to &s;often the Daughter, after &s;ome &s;mall reflections upon the Gentlemans hard terms, &s;he u&s;ed a Motherly Authority, to in|duce her Daughter to Complyance; 'tis true, indeed &s;he obje|cted, that 'twas a little &s;evere to rob a poor longing Bridearoom of an expected Virginity; yet con&s;idering that means might be u&s;ed to make him wholy un&s;en&s;ible of his Lo&s;s, what the Eye &s;aw not the Heart rued not; be&s;ides the hard&s;hip and Calamity that lay upon her mu&s;t oblige her to a Con&s;ent, which would be a great le&s;&s;ening to her Fault, under her nece&s;&s;ity that forced it. The Capt. too exerci&s;ed his &s;oftning Talent, and among&s;t other pre&s;&s;ing Arguments, he told the young Girl 'twas not &s;o hani|ous a fault as perhaps &s;he fancied it. The time was when by the cu&s;tom of &s;ome Tenures in &s;ome Countries the Lords of the Mannor claimed the fir&s;t Night with the Bride, and that with the very Husbands con&s;ent, but this gentler Night carry|ed with &s;ilence and &s;ecre&s;y, would be a ten times ea&s;ier and more venial Tre&s;pa&s;s At la&s;t, the Fort being won, it was concluded, (after a &s;plendid Supper at the Capt's Charge, in which, a chea|ful Gla&s;s of Wine had perhaps a little help'd forwards,) that their Bed-chambers being cho&s;en next Room to each other, the Mother &s;hould leave the door a-jar on purpo&s;e for the Captain's admi&s;&s;ion, and then retire her &s;elf to his bed chamber, for the Ca|ptain's Accommodation with the Daughter. The Plot thus laid, I dare not recount the Sweets the Capt. ta&s;ted at the fir&s;t gathering
<PB N="6" REF="5">of &s;uch <HI>unblown Ro&s;es;</HI> 'tis enough to tell you, that the Capt. appli|ed that <HI>&s;ub&s;tantial Eloquence</HI> to his &s;weet Bed-fellow, as &s;often'd infi|nitely more than all the <HI>ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">al Rhetorick</HI> he had u&s;ed before; in&s;o|much that not altogether &s;o much repining at the Captain's hard Terms (as we call'd 'em before) &s;he had not quite &s;o re&s;enting a thought of her Bridegroom's Hard&s;hip, nay truly, before morning (&s;uch miraculous operation had one &s;hort night wrought) that &s;he could not forbear, among&s;t other Endearments, to tell her bed-mate, <HI>That truly her Bridegroom</HI> (as much as we told you &s;he loved him before) <HI>was but an ordinary Countryman, and truly &s;he could wi&s;h he were but half &s;o &s;weet a Per&s;on as him&s;elf; but that was a happine&s;s too high for a poor Country Girls Ambition,</HI> &amp;c. How ravi&s;hingly the Capt. &s;pent his dear Night, may be better gue&s;t than told. Let it &s;uffice, he was &s;o pleas'd with his Bedfellow, that he threw in a Five Pound Peice of Gold to the 40 before &s;tipulated.</P>
<P>Early in the morning the Bridegroom, and &s;ome few friends at|tended the <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed Virgin Bride,</HI> and among&s;t many Country Jokes, &s;ome of his friends were pleas'd to <HI>droll</HI> upon the hard Nights Labour he mu&s;t expect, little imagining that the Capt. had taken that Toyl off his hands. The Bride was pleas'd to recommend the Capt. to her Husband's Acquaintance, telling him, that &s;he had fortunately met a Gentleman that proved to be a Cou&s;in of hers, one Mrs. &s;uch a one, his &s;econd Cou&s;in, being a fir&s;t Cou&s;in to a third Cou&s;in of hers, <HI>Mary</HI> &s;uch a one, or &s;ome &s;uch kind of <HI>Altiance</HI> between 'em; in&s;omuch that &s;everal <HI>mutual Compliments pa&s;t upon the Claiming Kin to &s;o Honourable a Relation.</HI> To conclude, the Capt's Affairs not per|mitting him to make one at the Wedding, tho much invited, all the fair Bride at parting could do, was to tell him, her husband's hou&s;e was at &s;uch a Place, and to make her husband Joyn with her in the &s;ame reque&s;t, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to conjure him, whenever he travell'd that way, to make their hou&s;e his home; and &s;o they &s;hook hands, and ki&s;t, not without a <HI>falling Tear,</HI> a <HI>Pearl</HI> be&s;tow'd upon the Capt. at parting, from the fair Bride, in &s;pight of <HI>all her endeavours to conceal it.</HI></P>
<P>This Adventure not ending here, it happened that about Ten Months after, the Capt. in his Travels that way, made bold to ac|cept of the Invitation afore&s;aid, and made the New Couple a Vi|&s;it at their hou&s;e near <HI>Newberry.</HI> Now it fell out that the poor wo|man was then in the Straw, having lain in about 3 Weeks. Here was great Joy of all hands for their long look'd for Gentle Couzen, more particularly on the female &s;ide. The husband (it being nigh Supper-time) pre&s;ently kills a couple of the fatte&s;t Fowls, and makes preparations for an extraordinary Entertainment; but the good Lady not being &s;atisfied with tho&s;e Regales the hou&s;e could
<PB N="7" REF="5">afford, be&s;ought her dear Spou&s;e to take a Walk to a Neighbouring <HI>Miller</HI>'s, &s;omething above half a Mile off, for a brace of Trouts. The good man offered to &s;end his Servant; but the good woman (for Rea&s;ons that &s;hall be namele&s;s) thought her husband the propere&s;t me&s;&s;enger; telling him, that his Man was &s;uch a Blockhead he knew not a Fi&s;h in &s;ea&s;on from one out of it. No, &s;he was re&s;olv'd none &s;hould manage a Di&s;h for her Couzen's Entertainment but him&s;elf. When the good man was upon the march for the Fi&s;h, the good Dame, who had her Nets to lay, was extreamly fond of her Vi&s;itant; nay, &s;he could not forbear telling him, that the thum|ping Boy &s;he &s;how'd him in the Cradle, was his own proper fle&s;h and blood; de&s;iring him to number back Weeks and Days to that dear Night with him at <HI>Newberry,</HI> and he &s;hould find the Account exactly agreeing: be&s;ides, &s;he was pleas'd, among&s;t a great many amorous Care&s;&s;es, to let him know, &s;he ta&s;ted tho&s;e bli&s;&s;es that Night which were never equall'd &s;ince, intimating, that there was not Manhood enough at home to go to the making of &s;o Lu&s;ty a Bantling. This Conver&s;ation, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the husband's ab&s;ence, made way for &s;ome nearer and dearer familiarity; and tho, tis true, a green woman, yet the Capt. not valuing colours, and the Lady tru&s;ting to the &s;trength of her Con&s;titution, gave him the Invitati|on of laying a foundation for a New Scion from the &s;ame fruitful Stock. Before the husband's Return, being all alone with the Capt. and being now a little hardier Love-Combitant than in her fir&s;t En|gagement with him, &s;he laid heads together with him for his com|pany the whole night with her; the de&s;ign being much fa|vour'd by the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of her Nur&s;e the day before to a new Mrs. Now all things convenient, and the Gue&s;t-Room for Lodging of Strangers being a lower Parlour, and lying beyond her husband's bed-room, through which he mu&s;t pa&s;s, &s;he dur&s;t not advi&s;e him to come and &s;teal that way up to her Chamber, as being too dange|rous a hazard. Upon mature re&s;ult, it came to this conclu&s;ion, that the Captain having a &s;mall back-door into the Yard from his Chamber, and the Room next to hers was a kind of Granary, into which her husband craned up all his Sacks of Meal, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it was agre|ed he &s;hould, after the whole hou&s;e was in bed, &s;teal out to the Crane, and &s;he would draw him up (being a matter not beyond her &s;trength) into the Granary, and &s;o take him to bed with her.</P>
<P>After this Project was laid, the Husband returned with a Brace and an half of good Trouts, which, together with &s;ome other Pro|vi&s;ions, made a &s;umptuous Banquet. During Supper-time, among&s;t other di&s;cour&s;e in prai&s;e of the Trouts, the Captain was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, he was a peice of a Fi&s;herman him&s;elf, but all the Trouts he
<PB N="8" REF="6">took were with tickling; which the &s;miling Young Dame was plea|&s;ed to &s;ay, was a very pretty way of fi&s;h catching. Bed time draw|ing on, and the Capt. being introduc'd to the Parlour, to his intend|ed Lodging, he undre&s;t him&s;elf for Bed; but as &s;oon as by all &s;igns he found all fa&s;t, he &s;lipt on his Coat, Breeches and Shooes only, and &s;oftly unbolting the back door. went to the Crane, where the kind Lady above &s;oon hoy&s;ted him up; and nothing now but a clear Stage, and from him no Favour, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Thus they continued all night, till a glimmering of day began to appear. But as a &s;pight|ful peice of <HI>Ill Luck,</HI> the poor husband fea&s;ting a little too heartily in the Entertainment of his Couzen, had a nece&s;&s;ity to go to the back|&s;ide for a certain occa&s;ion. From whence returning, he &s;py'd the Parlour open, at which a little &s;urpriz'd, he made bold to peep into the Captain's Room, where by the &s;mall dawn of day he plainly perceived the bed empty, &s;eeing only the Hat, Wig, and &s;ome other of the Capt's Accoutrements remaining on the Table.

Here, in &s;ine, he run on at a high Rate, how many Heroick Feats he had perform'd, how many Men, Captains and Collonels, he had kill'd with his own Hand, and what extraordi|nary Proofs of Manhood he had &s;hewn in all the Battles from before <HI>Londonderry</HI> to <HI>Agrim.</HI> Our Captain, who&s;e Patience almo&s;t tired, having heard him out with a &s;eeming Admiration of &s;o re|nown'd a Commander, could not forbear throwing in this unlucky Que&s;tion; Prithee, dear Captain, &s;ays be, if thou ha&s;t been in &s;o ma|ny Skirmi&s;hes, and Battles, and Sieges, and behav'd thy &s;elf in all of 'em with &s;uch &s;ignal Te&s;timonials of thy undaunted Valour; how comes it about, that with a good Hor&s;e under thee, a pair of Pi&s;tols before thee, and all things an&s;werable, thou ha&s;t &s;o tamely and coldly &s;uffered one &s;ingle Man, no better provided than thy &s;elf, to rob thee of all thou ha&s;t in the World, to keep thee from &s;tarving, without the lea&s;t di&s;pute or re&s;i&s;tance for &s;o important a Pre&s;ervation?

Poor Teague was &s;o highly tran&s;ported at this un|expected Favour, that he gave him a hundred Prayers; but above all, be&s;ought him to take care of his &s;weet Life, and not fall into the Heretick Hands of Law, till his great Ma&s;ter came to his Crown again; which would be as &s;oon as ever King <HI>Lewis</HI> could land him on Shore, and lead him to <HI>Whitehall;</HI> and then if he had commit|ted ten thou&s;and Robberies, this one favour to poor Teague, &s;hould &s;eal him a Pardon for 'em all.</P>
<P>Our Captain, more e&s;pecially in the beginning of his Travels, was extream hardy, and would daily venture into &s;everal Compa|nies in all Parts of the Town, but chiefly in the Out-parts, as <HI>Bi|&s;hop&s;gate-street, Minories, Spittle-fields,</HI> &amp;c. and was many times his own Intelligencer where to &s;et a good Prize, through his di&s;covery which way Mony travell'd, and where a lumping Booty was to be gotten. He happen'd one Evening to drink a Gla&s;s of Wine with an old Fellow, formerly an Alderman of the City of <HI>Durham,</HI> and pretty &s;trong in Pocket; the Captain being that time in a mode&s;t black Suit, profe&s;t him&s;elf a piece of a Doctor of Phi&s;ick, where|upon the Alderman, in the mirth of his brisk Cups, began to un|bo&s;ome &s;ome little part of his Soul, and tell him, He had made an A&s;&s;ignation with a very pretty young Girl, and the Morrow-night was to Bed with her all night; but, truly, being within a Year or two of Three&s;core, and under the Ro&s;e, a pretty Weather-beaten Fornicator, really he was afraid he &s;hould not hold out, to perform an&s;werable to his de&s;ire in the Enjoyment of &s;o &s;weet a Creature; and, therefore, if 'twere po&s;&s;ible for him to get any &s;trengthning Cordial to invigorate Nature, and make him a little brisk for that
<PB N="12" REF="8">one dear night, he would grutch no Reward to the Ingenious Arti&s;t that would accommodate him with &s;uch a favour. The Captain immediately engaged to &s;erve him in it, and that he would prepare him a Bolus, and &s;end it him to Morrow-morning, that &s;hould make him an ab&s;olute Boy of 22, &s;o vigorous a Lover, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and indeed make him perform Wonders; that he had had experience of the Preparation already, and had gotten good Gold by it. This gene|rous Promi&s;e extreamly inliven'd the old Spark, who paying the whole Shot, about one in the morning they &s;hook Hands, and part|ed, with a Promi&s;e of a Gratuity, according to the Skill of his Do|ctor, and the Merit of his Medicine. Accordingly, the Captain makes u&s;e of a Quack, a Friend of his, and &s;ends him in the morn|ing a Pot of Electuary, with Directions to take the quantity of a large Walnut, about 3 in the Afternoon, and about Bed-time he &s;hould find the Effects de&s;ired to his Hearts content. The night after the Doctor and Patient, about the hour of 9, had agreed to meet at the &s;ame Tavern, and there the Alderman was to make him a Large&s;s of acknowledgment, proportionable to the Raptures he ta&s;ted in the &s;oft Arms of his &s;weet Bed-fellow, and the prowe&s;s and pui&s;&s;ance he had received from his in&s;piring Electuary. They both met at the hour preci&s;ely, and our new Doctor &s;aluting his Patient, and inquiring how Matters &s;tood with him? Stood! with a Pox, replies the Alderman. Ay Friend, how and how did&s;t thou perform? How many dear Bouts old Boy? Was it not rare Phy|&s;ick? Did I not tell you what Miracles it would work? Hold a lit|tle (quoth Alderman) fair and &s;oftly: I tell you and your Doctor|&s;hip, never was Man &s;o abu&s;ed as I have been; Electuary in the De|vil's Name! If this be your Cordial, with a vengeance? Why how no Man, replies the Doctor, &s;ure you do but banter with me; I'll &s;tand by my Electuary to the la&s;t Penny of my E&s;tate, and an&s;wer the Compo&s;ition to the whole Colledge of Phy&s;icians; and there|fore prithee &s;peak plain, out with it Man; what Effects, what Operation, old Lad? Operation! (quoth Alderman) with a pite|ous mortifyed Look. Ay Friend, reply'd the Captain, Operation. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible that &s;uch a Preparation &s;hould fail; and therefore to make no Secret with thy Bodily Confe&s;&s;or, but in the Name of &s;oft Love and &s;weet Lechery, how and how my Heart of Oak? In &s;hort, after much pre&s;&s;ing from his importunate Quack, to know the full force and effects, what it had done, and how it had wrought, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> at la&s;t, after a very deep Sigh, this doleful An&s;wer broke out. Only three Stools (quoth Alderman) that's all. Stools, replied
<PB N="13" REF="8">the Captain, hardly holding his Countenance at &s;o comical an An|&s;wer. Lord, Sir, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible. Ay, Stools, quoth the Alder|man, nothing in the whole World, but three wicked filthy Stools; a Plague of your bea&s;tly Phy&s;ick. The Captain &s;eem'd very much concerned (hardly crediting the Relation) at &s;uch an unexpected Operation; and therefore de&s;ired the Alderman to tell him, how and when, and how much he took of it. So that the Alderman made an&s;wer, that truly he took it about the Hour of Three, ac|cording to pre&s;cription; and that being re&s;olved not to fail in the Do&s;e, but lay a more than ordinary Foundation for his intended Fe|licity, as he had order'd the quantity of one Walnut, to make &s;ure work, he had taken the quantity of two. Ounds, Man, replied the Captain, you &s;poil'd all; two Do&s;es at once! Death, I won|der it had not kill'd you; three Stools! Nay, 'tis well you come off &s;o well. Wou'd any, but a Madman, outrun his <HI>Recipe!</HI> and be wi&s;er than his Doctor! and &s;o make Poi&s;on of his Phy&s;ick. In fine, the Captain carried on the Rebuke with a very high Hand, and re|primanded his Patient's Folly and Frenzy at no &s;mall rate, in&s;o|much that the Alderman cried Peccavi, imputed his Misfortune to his own Indi&s;cretion, and the Doctor recover'd his Reputation as fair and whole again as his Heart cou'd wi&s;h. And now the poor lamenting Alderman unbo&s;oming his whole Load of Sorrow, told him, how the contrary Effects of his Bolus had utterly di&s;abled him from ta&s;ting any Delights at all with his young Bedfellow; nay, what was wor&s;t of all, it being his mi&s;chance to be lock'd up in the Room, together with her, and the Key in another Body's hand, not able to get out, he was forced to make u&s;e of the Cham|ber-pot, and that, as the Devil would have it, not large enough for the treble Di&s;charge afore&s;aid, he was compell'd to make u&s;e of the Chimney for di&s;po&s;ing the Overplus, to his great &s;hame and confu&s;ion, being not only a mo&s;t impotent, but likewi&s;e a mo&s;t un|&s;avoury Bedfellow. And all he could do to excu&s;e his Calamity, was by telling the whole naked Truth to the poor defeated Crea|ture, and laying the whole Fault upon the Villany of the Phy&s;i|cian. That the Girl was kindly pleas'd (much more than he de|&s;erved) to commi&s;erate rather than laugh at him, and that truly having atoned for his Mi&s;carriage by a brace of Jacobu&s;&s;es next Morning, he had made a new Contract with her, and &s;ent her down to a Lodging at <HI>North-hall,</HI> whether him&s;elf was next Morn|ing to follow her, and there to enjoy her for the whole Water|&s;ea&s;on.
<PB N="14" REF="9">The Captain offer'd his Service of waiting him thither, having (as he told him) a long Inclination to a little Diver&s;ion at tho&s;e Wells, which the Alderman kindly embraced; whether lovingly letting out together early next Morning, the Doctor, at a convenient opportunity in the Road, was pleas'd to give his Pa|tient a gentle Purgation of about fifty odd Pounds, and &s;ome other &s;mall Toys about him, as a Ring, Watch, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and &s;o left the poor Limberham as feeble in Pur&s;e as before in Back, to his be&s;t Enter|tainment of his <HI>North hull Bona Roba.</HI></P>
<P>Another no le&s;s divertive Narrative we have to make you, <HI>viz.</HI> That one Evening, according to his cu&s;tomary hardine&s;s of Com|pany-keeping, he fell into the Society of three or four &s;turdy Ja|cobites of good Quality and Fa&s;hion. One of which a Gentleman of a con&s;iderable E&s;tate, and a little above mid-way, between 20 and 30 Years old, lay under an obligation of never cutting his Beard, till K. <HI>James</HI> return'd; and having commenced his Oath as far &s;ince as the fir&s;t day of Abdication, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and being naturally a hand&s;om black Man, his overgrown, Raven-colour'd Excre&s;cence in &s;o many Years, unhappily brindled with a mixture of white, had reacht down almo&s;t to his Wa&s;te, and perhaps altogether was not &s;o modi&s;h nor &s;o beaui&s;h a Figure, as otherwi&s;e &s;o accompli&s;ht a Gentleman might have made. Neverthele&s;s his high Adoration for his old Ma&s;ter, and his Veneration for the Solemne&s;s of his Vow &s;uper&s;eded all other Con&s;iderations, and no Advice nor Intere&s;t whatever could prevail with our re&s;olute <HI>Nazareen</HI> to part with the lea&s;t Twig from &s;o &s;preading a Bu&s;h. Nay, as ill luck wou'd have it, the Gentleman was at that time fal'n de&s;perately in Love with a young and mo&s;t beautiful Lady, who had no di&s;like to his Per&s;on, nor any di&s;reli&s;h to his Addre&s;&s;es, only &s;he utterly refu&s;ed to marry him, till he would yield to &s;acrifice that unweildy Crab|ne&s;t, and bring a &s;mooth Chin to her &s;oft Embraces. In fine, his Beard being the only Bar to his Felicity, the Con&s;ummation, he de|clared, was wholly ob&s;tructed on no other account. This Subject being a great part of the pre&s;ent Conver&s;ation, &s;ome of the Com|pany were pleas'd to applaud his Ma&s;culine Re&s;olution, in keeping firm to his Loyal Vow, whatever the Effeminate Whi&s;pers of Love might per&s;wade to the contrary. Others were a little more in|clining to the Lady's Party, and cou'd not but approve her Re&s;olu|tion in not expo&s;ing her &s;oft Lips and &s;mooth Cheeks to &s;uch rude and barbarous Bri&s;tles. The Gentleman for his part avow'd, that
<PB N="15" REF="9">he could half hang or drown to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;o &s;weet a Creature, never|thele&s;s could no ways recede from his Oath; and if &s;he per&s;i&s;ted wholly inexorable, whatever his Sufferings would prove, he mu&s;t continue deaf, even to the lea&s;t thought of violation of &s;o &s;olemn an Engagement. In fine, as fa&s;t and as deep as the Lady was in his Heart, his Beard was as fa&s;t rooted too; and nothing but the Return of his great Ma&s;ter, with the bright Sword in his Hand, &s;hould ever bring the gentle Razour to his Chin.</P>
<P>Many Arguments were bandied round among&s;t this jolly Com|pany, and a great Conte&s;t of Love and Honour, betwixt Beard and Mi&s;tre&s;s, was no &s;mall piece of the Entertainment, and among&s;t the many Bumpers to the old Ma&s;ter, and the young Lady, a good Health to the honourable Beard, made one or two cheerful Gla&s;&s;es go round extraordinary. The Captain being as high a Jacobite as the be&s;t of them, took occa&s;ion highly to commi&s;erate the Gentle|man's unhappine&s;s in the &s;trange ob&s;tinacy of his fair Adored; for that was the be&s;t Name he could give to her unrea&s;onable Denials, of &s;o accompli&s;ht a Gentleman, on &s;o trivial an Account. What the Devil mu&s;t the Women in &s;ome parts of the World do for Husbands, if the Objection of a Beard were a &s;ufficient refu&s;al? Nay, what mu&s;t all our great Grand-mothers here in <HI>England</HI> have done in the old Days of Gravity, when thicker Chins and thinner Foretops were in fa&s;hion? Some Beard, not all Perriwig; a little lower Tire, not all upper Tire, Curl and Friz. For his part, he did not doubt but if he had the Honour of &s;eeing this fair Lady, but he &s;hould be &s;o powerful an Orator in his behalf, as to reduce her to rea&s;on, and make an intire Accommodation in the Affair: Nay, &s;omething (he proceeded) whi&s;per'd him, that he was cer|tainly born to do the Gentleman &s;ome &s;ervice in this Bu&s;ine&s;s, and undoubtedly obtain him his Lady. The Gentleman could not but return him his hearty thanks for the Zeal he expre&s;t in his behalf, and that truly &s;ince all Interce&s;&s;ion and Eloquence had hitherto pro|ved un&s;ucce&s;sful, neverthele&s;s, if he pleas'd to try his abler Rheto|rick in the matter, he &s;hould be proud of his good Company at the Lady's at Dinner to Morrow, &s;he living not above a dozen Miles out of Town, and whither an Hour and a half's riding in the cool of the Morning would bring 'em &s;o early Vi&s;itants as to nick the La|dy's upri&s;ing. Hands being &s;hook upon it, and the next Morning's loving Journey accordingly concluded, the Company &s;oon after broke up, and the Captain fail'd not to awake the Gentleman out
<PB N="16" REF="10">of his Bed next Morning, and to call our amorous Knight Errant for Mount and Away. The Gentleman, on his &s;ide, took no Ser|vant with him, only the Captain had his Friend, a Gentleman who had occa&s;ion of travelling that way, and would make one to in|crea&s;e the good Company. So all three merrily jogging on, Con|venience &s;oon offer'd, when the Captain de&s;iring to &s;earch the Depth of the Gentleman's Pocket, the Gentleman, though other|wi&s;e pretty brisk, yet well remembring, that two to one, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> was an old Proverb, was forced peaceably to unhor&s;e, and &s;urrender at di&s;cretion, and di&s;cumber his Pocket of a Gold-Watch, and a|bout half a hundred Yellow-Boys, being at that time his whole Cargo. Nay, &s;ays the Captain, &s;ince you have &s;o very generou&s;ly re&s;ign'd, though, perhaps, I may have &s;urpriz'd you in this unex|pected Treatment, neverthele&s;s I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">all be as big as my Promi&s;e in &s;erving you with your Mi&s;tre&s;s, a Compen&s;ation that &s;hall over|pay the&s;e incon&s;iderable Trifles: And therefore, <HI>Tom,</HI> (&s;ays he) turning to his Comrade, Where are the Snippers? Here, Ma|&s;ter, replies his Mate, pulling out of his Pocket a large Pair of Barber's Sci&s;&s;ors. To come to the point, They over-ma&s;ter'd the poor Gentleman, and getting both upon him, they held him down by main force, till <HI>Tom</HI> made a hard &s;hift to &s;nip off intirely ju&s;t one &s;ide of his Beard, clo&s;e to his Face; then giving him fair leave to ri&s;e, the Captain addre&s;t him&s;elf in this manner: Look you, Sir, &s;ays he, here's Love and Honour reconcil'd. You have &s;worn, you would never con&s;ent to cut your Beard, till K. <HI>J.</HI> returned; and now thank Heav'n for rai&s;ing you tho&s;e Friends that have cut it with|out your con&s;ent. You have &s;worn you'll wear a Beard, Right; but you have not &s;worn you'll wear one &s;ide of one, when t'other's off.

<P>The Gentleman how unkindly &s;oever he might re&s;ent this In&s;ult and Raillery upon him, however partly as overpowered, but chiefly &s;atisfied in the plain Truth of the ca&s;e, (how drollingly &s;oever the Captain had worded it,) cou'd not forbear, after two or three hearty Oaths, telling the Captain, that By G&mdash;he was an hone&s;t fellow and had done his work for him; And therefore &s;ince he had found out &s;o dexterous a Di&s;pen&s;ation to his long trouble&s;ome vow, and open'd &s;o fair a path to his Mrs's Arms upon the Honour of a Gentleman he truly forgave him all he had took from him; To which were it twice as much he was hear|tily welcome; And to &s;hew him he was &s;o, he kindly invited him to his Wedding, binding it with an hundred Oaths that not a Hair of his Head &s;hould &s;uffer, if he would grant him that fa|vour of his Company; The Captain &s;eeing him &s;o heartily pre&s;s it, gave him as &s;olemn a promi&s;e that he would make one at the Nuptials, and accordingly agreed that he &s;hould give him notice of the day by a Penny Po&s;t Letter left in &s;uch a name at &s;uch a Hou&s;e in <HI>London.</HI> 'Twas not ten days after, before the inviting Letter came, and the Day appointed, the Nuptials to be cele|brated at his own Seat about 30 Miles from <HI>London.</HI> In the Af|ternoon about two hours after the Bridal Fea&s;t, a jolly Troop of about half a &s;core of Sparks well mounted, all with half Vi|zords Lighted at the Gentlemans Gate, and de&s;ired admi&s;&s;ion as Ma&s;quers to entertain the Bride and Bridegroom, which was im|mediately granted, and they all very ceremoniou&s;ly introduced. The Captain took the Bridegroom a&s;ide and di&s;covered his Face, telling him he had kept his word, but withal de&s;iring his &s;ecre|cy, at the &s;ame time a&s;&s;uring him, that tho' the re&s;t of his Gang were all Brothers of his own My&s;tery, yet as this Vi&s;it was pure|ly Honour and Friend&s;hip, neither him&s;elf nor any one of his Honourable Gue&s;ts, &s;hould &s;uffer the lea&s;t farthing either going or coming, by him&s;elf or any one of his &s;mall Troop. The Gentleman no ways di&s;tru&s;ting his Fidelity, the be&s;t half of the Night was pa&s;t in Dancing, Fea&s;ting and Revelling, the Ma&s;que|raders performing in all points to Admiration, and gaining as far upon all the uningaged Female Hearts in the Company, as nimble Heels and half Faces could pu&s;h towards a Conque&s;t. When the Bride, not till near Cock-crowing, could get loo&s;e, &s;toln out by her kind Bridemaids, to the envied felicity of a Nuptial Bed, and the brisk now &s;mooth-chind Lover was pre|paring to follow her, the Captain took his leave being extream|ly care&s;t by his Honourable Ho&s;t.</P>

<P>About three months after the Captain had &s;et a Booty of two hundred pound, being &s;ome part of the Pelf of an Overgrown Mi&s;er travelling up with it to <HI>London</HI> in the <HI>Banbury</HI> Stage Coach. It happen'd that the Coach was full, having five Women be|&s;ides Sir <HI>Mammon</HI> him&s;elf in it, who infinitely di&s;obliged his Fe|male Fellow Travellers by &s;moaking all the way a &s;ort of a <HI>Ber|mudas</HI> Funk, &s;trong and cheap, and though highly courted to &s;ome moderation in his Mundungo, yet being an ill natured old chuff, and pa&s;t the Age of Complai&s;ance, not all the intreaties of the Fair Sex could prevail, in&s;omuch that he had almo&s;t poy&s;on'd or at lea&s;t half choak'd them. But the Captain de&s;tined for their Deliverance with 3 or 4 more of his Retinue, riding up to the Coach de&s;ired the favour of ea&s;ing the Coach-box of two hun|dred pound burthen. The old Muckworm as (you may ima|gine) in no &s;mall con&s;ternation at this mortal Alarm, &s;o fright|ed that 'twas hard to di&s;tingui&s;h which end of him &s;tunk wor&s;t; the Ladies were a little &s;tartled at fir&s;t, but the Captain &s;oon di&s;|&s;ipated their fears by profe&s;&s;ing all the kindne&s;s and civility they could de&s;ire, being indeed always generous to that Sex. How|ever after he had unca&s;ed our fat old Fox he &s;pyed a Diamond Ring upon one of the Ladies Fingers, and a Necklace of Pearl upon anothers Neck, both which he was pleas'd to reque&s;t, which were accordingly granted him; only the young Mi&s;s from whom he took the Necklace being not above thirteen years old fell in|to a de&s;perate fit of crying for the Lo&s;s of her Necklace, which the Captain perceiving, in kind pity returned it her again; and not to be partial in his favours was going to do the like by the Lady from whom he took the Ring, making her a very cour|teous Complement be&s;eeching the whole fair Companies Par|don, avowing that &s;oft Sex &s;hould have no rea&s;on to complain of Captain <HI>Whitney,</HI> whatever murmurs the old Hunk, the gruff Sir with them might conceive again&s;t him.</P>
<P>The Lady at the name of <HI>Whitney</HI> utterly refu&s;ed the return of her Ring, de&s;iring him to wear it for her &s;ake, telling him that he had helpt her to the be&s;t Husband in Chri&s;tendom, and &s;o &s;mall a pre&s;ent was the lea&s;t Acknowledgment of &s;o &s;ignal an Obligation, de&s;iring him withal to accept of a Gla&s;s of <HI>Aqua Mirabilis,</HI> &s;o drinking to him out of a Gla&s;s Bottle his own Health, not forgetting his Man <HI>Tom,</HI> the be&s;t mad Shaver in the three Kingdoms; the Captain pledged her, and dealt the La|dies Health round among&s;t his Brothers of the <HI>Pad,</HI> and &s;o took his leave, having at lea&s;t &s;o far obliged them all, that the Old
<PB N="19" REF="11">Tobacco-monger had broken his Pipe for madne&s;s at the lo&s;s of his Money, and this la&s;t &s;ad Whiff had put him &s;o out of all his patience, or thoughts of Smoking, that the Air began a little to clear again among&s;t 'em; But of all his Adventures this follow|ing is perhaps the bolde&s;t and brave&s;t. Among&s;t his Intelligencers he had been adverti&s;ed of &s;even hundred Guineas that a per&s;on of very high Quality, and a great Cock-fighter, had taken up, and &s;uch a day was to move home with them about thirty Miles We&s;tward, and accordingly a &s;ub&s;tantial Attaque was re&s;olved upon at &s;uch a Po&s;t in the Road; but as matters fell out, a Mag|got and a Gla&s;s extraordinary in the Gentlemans Head mounted him a day &s;ooner than re&s;olved, in&s;omuch that the Captain was defeated of the Prize, his whole Gang being over-reacht by coming a day after the Fair, and the Gentleman reaching Har|bour with the <HI>Cargo</HI> &s;afe within Walls and Sanctuary. This Di&s;|appointment vext the Captain to the Soul, but re&s;olved not to give over the Game as de&s;perate as it &s;eem'd, he at la&s;t invent|ed one of the mo&s;t politick and hardie&s;t Stratagems that po&s;&s;ibly was ever undertaken; which take as follows.</P>
<P>The Gentleman one day &s;oon after, as cu&s;tomary with him, taking his Hor&s;e, (without any Ceremony of Retinue or Ser|vants) to Dine with another Countrey-Gentleman about half a dozen Miles off, in the Evening returning on the Road, and within two Miles of home, he was a&s;&s;aulted by five High-way|men, who led him about &s;ix or &s;even Pole a&s;ide into a By-Lane, but not out of &s;ight of the Road; there they di&s;mounted him, took away his Watch, and that little Money he had about him, and not contented with that, &s;trip'd him of his Coat, Hat, and embroider'd Wa&s;tcoat, binding him hand and foot, and re|&s;olving to drag him up higher in the By-Lane out of hearing, and &s;ight of the Road, there to gag him, and leave him bound in a Ditch all night. This Barbarity, you may well imagine, was a very terrible Apprehen&s;ion to the unhappy Gentleman, who though not valuing his incon&s;iderable Lo&s;s, neverthele&s;s the Dread of being expo&s;ed almo&s;t naked all night, &s;ugge&s;ted little le&s;s than his certain Death from &s;o much Inhumanity. But ju&s;t in this doleful Minute of Horrour and De&s;pair, it happened that a Gentleman very well dre&s;t, and nobly well mounted, attended by a Servant in the <HI>Nor&s;olk</HI> Livery, and as well mounted as his Ma&s;ter, travelling that way, who di&s;covering a pack of Thieves with an unfortunate Prey in their Talons, <HI>Lamn me</HI> &s;ays he <HI>what's yonder?

Here our generous Champion and his Man both di&s;mounted to un|bind the poor Gentleman, who could &s;carce forbear acknow|ledging his Gratitude for &s;o &s;ignal a Deliverance upon his knees. But among&s;t other Care&s;&s;es humbly de&s;iring to know to whom he owed this extraordinary protection; The Stranger was plea|&s;ed to an&s;wer him his Name was <HI>B.

And look you Sir to un|riddle your Amazement, for I perceive you are &s;urpriz'd, in plain Engli&s;h you were a &s;aver la&s;t night to be a lo&s;er to day; for in&s;tead of the Right Honourable <HI>B. H.</HI> I am only the Right Hone&s;t Captain <HI>Whitney,</HI> and &s;o without more Ceremony I mu&s;t have that &s;even hundred pound, or your Life Sir.

<P>Now Reader, having given you this choice Collection of his livelie&s;t and &s;prightlie&s;t Adventures, I &s;hall only conclude with that la&s;t Rencounter, the misfortune of which brought him to his Cata&s;trophe.</P>
<P>About <HI>Michaelmas</HI> la&s;t on the <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> Road, being that time by chance alone, he met a Gentleman Mounted upon a pretty indif|ferent good Hack, with a Pair of Pi&s;tols before him and his Lady &s;ingle Hor&s;ed, attended by a &s;turdy Lout, with a Sword tyed to his Breech. This odds of two to one di&s;heartned not our brisk Captain, who very fairly perking up to the Ma&s;ter, gives him the cu&s;tomary &s;alute of <HI>Stand and Deliver;</HI> The Gentle|man, whether thro' &s;urprize, or any other con&s;ideration, with|out any Re&s;i&s;tance, very patiently delivers him the All he had, being not above five or &s;ix pounds. The Gentlewoman &s;eeing her Husband &s;o Cow-hearted, in &s;o tame a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, fell very loud upon him, call'd him a hundred Chicken-&s;oul'd Cowards, and in &s;hort no name bad enough. The Captian &s;eeing the La|dy &s;o Spirited a <HI>Virago,</HI> addre&s;t him&s;elf to her, telling her, the little Money he had taken, was not worth all this Pa&s;&s;ion The Money! Damn the Money, replied the Dame, for though as little as 'tis, 'tis &s;omething in an Abdicated Officers Pocket, yet 'tis not that Trifle I am concern'd for, no 'tis the Nature of the Brute, the &s;hame of the Coward and Craven that Delivered it, that di&s;turbs me; A fellow that has had the honour of a Com|mi&s;&s;ion in his Pocket, and to have a Heart no bigger. Princes are finely help'd up with &s;uch doughty Commanders. Him&s;elf and his overgrown Booby at his Ar&s;e, both of 'em &s;uch a pair of Tame Turtles, to &s;uffer them&s;elves to be &s;o ba&s;ely and &s;can|dalou&s;ly rob'd. Death! If I had been half &s;o well armed my &s;elf, I'd have changed one brace of Bullets with you before I'd have yielded. The Captain was &s;trangely amazed and as highly delighted with the Spirit and Bravery of the Woman, together with no little charm in her Face, to add to his Delight, being indeed a very lovely Creature; And gave her a great many very care&s;&s;ing Compliments, which the Lady as courteou&s;ly returned, at which the Captain &s;eeing the Gray Mare the better Hor&s;e, very generou&s;ly made her a pre&s;ent of what he had taken from her Husband, which the Lady thankfully received, telling him, that &s;he had that veneration for &s;o much Honour and Bravery, that if ever it were her good fortune to meet him in <HI>London,</HI> &s;he would expre&s;s her gratitude for his genero&s;ity and her e&s;teem for his Gallantry in a more &s;ub&s;tantial acknowledgment. The
<PB N="23" REF="13">Captain &s;wore a great Oath he would make it his bu&s;ine&s;s to find her out there. That you may &s;oon do, replied the Lady, if you have old-fa&s;hion'd Religion enough to carry you to the Spani&s;h Amba&s;&s;adors Chappel, whither the little Devotion I have brings me generally every Morning. The Captain told her that whatever his own Religion was, his Re&s;pects to &s;o fair a Lady cou'd convert him to any Church, and he &s;hould not fail the Pious A&s;&s;ignation afore&s;aid. But to prevent his Que&s;t of his fair Inviter at Chappels and High Altars, it was his Fortune to meet her in le&s;s Holy Ground; For one Morning about five or &s;ix days after, the Captain muffled in his Cloak and in a Coach with the Windows drawn up, had occa&s;ion to make a &s;tand in the <HI>Strand</HI> for one of his Comrades to meet him there. During his &s;top there, through a broken Pane in the Coach Window, he di&s;covered the very Lady at a Milliners Shop buying a pair of Gloves and &s;ome other &s;mall matters, which when &s;he had pur|cha&s;ed, turning her Face to the Street-ward, a Coach was call'd for her, which the Captain perceiving threw open the door of his Coach, and told the Lady here was one at her Service; The Lady immediately remembring the Face. Oh dear Couzen, &s;ays &s;he, are you there! And &s;o accepting his Kindne&s;s, imme|diately &s;tept into the Coach to him; Where the Door and Win|dow where both pre&s;ently clo&s;ed again. The Captain very joy|fully embracing her, and asking whither they &s;hould drive; an|&s;wer was made, e'ne where he pleas'd. Hereupon the Coach|man was bid to drive to <HI>Knights-bridge,</HI> where lighting at the Swan, a very &s;umptuous Dinner was be&s;poken, and the Lovers (for &s;o I'll venture to call 'em) left to all the Enjoyment and Felicity the Accommodation of &s;o Ho&s;pitable a Hou&s;e could yield 'em. I &s;hall not be tedious in telling you, that this Meet|ing ended in Love, and the be&s;t and heartie&s;t effects of it the Captain could give her. Let it &s;uffice the &s;atisfaction was infi|nitely plea&s;ing on both &s;ides, the Lady among&s;t a hundred other Care&s;&s;es, a&s;&s;uring him, that this was the fir&s;t time &s;he ever wrong'd her Husband in this kind, (at lea&s;t you have the Ladys word for't if Cuckolding a Coward may be properly called wronging him, being indeed the lea&s;t he de&s;erv'd. Among&s;t the re&s;t of the Conver&s;ation &s;he told the Captain how her Hu&s;|band was once a Cornet in K. <HI>J&mdash;s</HI> his Army, that &s;he had always affectionately loved him, with all the Truth and Fidelity of a Wife, till that Adventure upon the Road utterly alienated her Heart from him, conceiving &s;uch a natural Aver&s;ion to a
<PB N="24" REF="14">to a Coward, (in which to her long delu&s;ion, &s;he had never till then an occa&s;ion of trial of him) that &s;he loath'd the very thought of him. This Declaration was but a new Spur to the Captains Affections, being &s;trangely delighted both with her Per&s;on and Humour, in&s;omuch that before they parted, a match was &s;truck up between 'em, that the Lady &s;hould leave her Husband, and live with him, who would take care to main|tain her like a Gentlewoman, &s;he being indeed &s;o pleas'd with the Captain, that &s;he was ea&s;ily won to relinqui&s;h the broken Fortune of a &s;lighted Husband, for the Embraces of a Darling Gallant.</P>
<P>Accordingly, the Captain in a day or two after, (by which time &s;he &s;o managed matters at home, as to troop off with all the Bag and Baggage &s;he could make) provided her a Retire|ment, a Lodging <HI>Alamode;</HI> And accompanied her as often as Affairs would permit, with all the Endearments and Care&s;&s;es imaginable. But as Men of his cautious Profe&s;&s;ion generally make their Re&s;idences, like Tartar Camps, not long in a place, but always in motion, he danced her about from one quarter of the Town to another, and at la&s;t a Lodging was fixt for her at one Mr. <HI>Hills</HI> a Turner, his Hou&s;e in a Court at <HI>Hounds-Ditch:</HI> Hither the Captain made his vi&s;its, under the Title of a Brother, his name Captain <HI>Alcock;</HI> For by this time his Fame being loud in the World, and him&s;elf under the Apprehen&s;ion of too many clo&s;e Hunters, he made it his &s;tudy to cro&s;s the Scent by &s;hort turns, and &s;mall &s;tops; In&s;omuch that his vi&s;its here were but once in five or &s;ix days, and tho&s;e generally of <HI>Saturdays,</HI> and always at Night Time, not daring to &s;tay a whole Night with his dear Mi&s;tre&s;s, and therefore on purpo&s;e dignified at this Lodg|ing by no higher a Title than a Si&s;ter. The Landlord had &s;ome time before &s;een and known Captain <HI>Whitney,</HI> but this new name of <HI>Alcock,</HI> and the &s;everal years ago &s;ince this little know|ledge of his per&s;on had almo&s;t defaced that remembrance, in&s;o|much that he went and came without any curio&s;ity or ob&s;erva|tion from his Landlord, till unfortunately about a week before his apprehen&s;ion the Lady having occa&s;ion to call him back at the Stair Head, upon his departure, in&s;tead of Brother or <HI>Alcock,</HI> unluckily cried, Mr. <HI>Whitney,</HI> Mr. <HI>Whitney,</HI> one word with you before you go. This being ca&s;ually overheard by his Landlord perfectly refre&s;ht his Memory, and recollected his &s;leeping know|ledge of the Captain; and accordingly re&s;olving to be prepared for his next vi&s;it, and bid fair for the 40 <HI>l.</HI> &s;et upon his Head, he

But it fell out, as the Mi&s;s 'tis thought had &s;ome &s;mall &s;moking of danger, and therefore had given him &s;ome cautionary Advice, this la&s;t Vi&s;it was an extream &s;hort one, for before the Con|&s;table could be fetched, the Captain had taken leave, and ru&s;ht by the ju&s;tled Con&s;table; but his Landlord more pre&s;&s;ing and hardy, pu&s;ht forward, and boldly grappled him alone him&s;elf in the Street, in the &s;urprize tripping up the Captains Heels; but the Captain recovering him&s;elf, and getting the Advantage of his weaker A&s;&s;ailant, drew his Sword, and backward under his Cloak wounded the Joyner in his Thigh, at which he fell, and a great Out-cry of Stop Thief en&s;uing, throwing off his Cloak, made a fair pair of Heels for his Life; when unluckily mi&s;tak|ing his way, in&s;tead of running down <HI>Bedlam</HI> Lane, he ran through a Ho&s;iers Shop, where for want of a pa&s;&s;age through, being &s;topt in the back Room, the whole Body of the Mob &s;oon advanced, and our Captain with Sword and Pi&s;tol in hand &s;tood at Bay and faced them, till &s;uch time Me&s;&s;age was &s;ent both to Major <HI>Richard&s;on</HI> and the Sheriffs, who approaching with their Re&s;pective Retinue, Re&s;i&s;tance was thought wholly in vain, and the Captain patiently &s;urrendred; from whence be|ing Hand cuft, and put into a Coach, he was u&s;hered in great Ceremony, (e&s;pecially if Crouds and Noi&s;e be any part of State) to <HI>Newgate.</HI></P>
<P>In this unhappy Durance, though his Leggs were a little tyed, his Name roved far enough; for the whole Town rung at no little rate: His Vi&s;itants were pre&s;ently numerous; for where one came under any pretence of charging him with any Rob|bery, a hundred came purely for a &s;ight of his &s;weet Face. To the&s;e la&s;t &s;ort of Gue&s;ts he behaved him&s;elf with a &s;ort of a pride and &s;trutt, as if he &s;eem'd plea&s;ed with &s;o popular a Vanity as making a Raree-&s;how. To the other &s;ort that came in as Spies, he de&s;ired 'em to be cautious how they charg'd him with any thing; for it had been a cu&s;tomary Fallacy among&s;t the High|way-men on all occa&s;ions, to own them&s;elves all to be <HI>Whitneys,</HI> by a trick of &s;hewing their left Hands with their Thumbs &s;lipt into the palm of their Gloves; whereby very notorious Faults were fathered upon him, of which he was utterly innocent.</P>
<P>Among&s;t his Vi&s;itants one hone&s;t Countrey-man came to Im|peach him of a very Extraordinary Robbery, <HI>viz.</HI> a Maiden-head that the Captain had taken from a young Girl, the Countrey|mans Sweet-heart, which was no little heart-breaking to him,
<PB N="26" REF="15">as being no mean adorer (if that word be not too high for him) of his dear La&s;s thus unhappily debaucht, and wor&s;e than ravi&s;ht from him. The Captain was much concern'd at the poor Coun|trey-mans Tears and Sighs on &s;o &s;orrowful a Subject, and like a Man of Honour utterly abjured &s;o much as his lea&s;t knowledge of the poor Girl &s;o traduced and &s;landered, averring her to be a Virgin and a Saint for any thing he knew of her; and in &s;hort &s;o &s;alved her wounded Reputation, and &s;o &s;weetened the be|lieving good Man into an opinion of her Innocence, that he begg'd a hundred pardons, and immediately troop'd to the very next Gold-&s;miths for a certain Implement call'd a Thumb-Ring, and thence to <HI>Snow-Hill</HI> to the fir&s;t Sales-mans Shop, re&s;olving to rig him&s;elf for a Bridegroom immediately, and con&s;ummate before to morrow night; being only heartily afflicted that he could not have the Captain for a Bride-man, unle&s;s he would make u&s;e of the <HI>Ordinary</HI> for a Chaplain.</P>
<P>But to take our leave of his gentler Conver&s;ation his kind pri|&s;on Vi&s;itants, and bring him before more formidable Faces the Se&s;&s;ion drew on, and on <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the &s;eventeenth of <HI>January,</HI> he was brought to the <HI>Old-Bayly</HI> and Indited for a Burglary com|mitted upon the Hou&s;e of <HI>John Flanders</HI> of <HI>Enfield</HI> in the Coun|ty of <HI>Miale&s;ex,</HI> on the 28th of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> was twelve month la&s;t pa&s;t. Here the Evidence, as you have been told at length in the common Se&s;&s;ions paper, not fully proving the charge upon him, he was Acquited of this fir&s;t Inditctment: But on the morrow on a new charge, for a Robbery committed at <HI>South-Mims wa&s;h,</HI> on the tenth of <HI>November</HI> la&s;t, he was pre&s;t a little more home, and po&s;&s;itively charged with the &s;aid Robbery, upon Coviction whereof, he received Sentence of Death.</P>
<P>After &s;uch Serious Circum&s;tances as the con&s;ideration of ap|proaching Death we ought to &s;uit our di&s;cour&s;e accordingly, neverthele&s;s we cannot omit one plea&s;ant Adventure more. One of his Feminie Votaries was plea&s;ed to write him this fol|lowing Letter,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am very &s;orry to hear of your Fatal Sentence, but do not pre&s;ume &s;o brave a valiant Man as your &s;elf will fail of Pardon, but if you are in danger, &s;end word by the Bearer, and if you think it can be procured, a Party of young Ladies are re&s;olved to petition Their Ma|je&s;ties in your behalf; but I am told it cannot be done without taking for better for wor&s;e, and then I am &s;ure there is a great Objection in the way, being your &s;elf al|ready in the Matrimonial Noo&s;e. Now my &s;imple Opi|nion is, after Sentence is pa&s;t a Per&s;on is free, but that's but a Womans imagination, and one that does heartily wi&s;h it may be &s;o. If what I propo&s;e be po&s;&s;ible, and you have Courage to venture on the mo&s;t unde&s;erving of our whole Sex, I'll venture to cro&s;s my Inclination to &s;ave what I cannot give, for I have ever been aver&s;e to|wards Matrimony, nor do I now do it for the &s;ake of a Husband, or any other Self-Intere&s;t; for if I were once a&s;&s;ured of your dear Life, I de&s;ire no more to &s;ee you.</P>
</LETTER>
<P><HI>After his peru&s;al hereof, he borrowed &s;ome Minutes from his deepe&s;t Meditations to return this Acknowledging An|&s;wer.</HI></P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am now at a &s;tand how to expre&s;s my Thanks for your mo&s;t generous Intentions towards me, and can|not imagine how I have merited two &s;uch great Favours as you are plea&s;ed to mention; fir&s;t to &s;ave my Life,
<PB N="28" REF="16">and then to make that happy by this way you mention. As for the Noo&s;e you &s;peak of, 'tis ea&s;ier &s;lipt, than that I am like to come into, if not prevented by you, having no A&s;&s;urance or Hopes of Life from any body.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>We will not pre&s;ume to enquire into the Integrity of this profe&s;&s;ing kind Lady, or whether her &s;elf in the Head of her Female Troop were true to their A&s;&s;ignation, in meet|ing at the doleful <HI>Padington</HI> Scene, in their nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplica|ting Virgin Weeds, as the foremention'd charitable &s;uppliants for his Deliverance by tying one Noo&s;e for the &s;lipping the other; all we have to a&s;&s;ure you is that both our Letters are ver|batim from the Originals.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding the di&s;mal Voice of Fate; <HI>viz. To the Place of Execution, &amp;c.</HI> the Captain &s;o divided the Affections of the People, that the favourable Party had that extraordi|nary E&s;teem for &s;omething they were pleas'd to call Bravery in him, that whether from their skill in the Stars that &s;ome Be|nign <HI>Mercurial</HI> Planet &s;mil'd upon him, or that they fancied the Court mu&s;t look upon him with Their Eyes, they concluded for certain that a Beam of Royal Mercy would &s;hine for his Deli|verance. In&s;omuch that his Life and Death, like the Surrender of <HI>Limerick,</HI> was the daily &s;ubject of very high Wagers. But the high-flown Deliverance-Men received &s;ome &s;mall Mortification when they &s;aw him move off up the <HI>High-Holborn</HI> Road, the Right-hand-man of the fir&s;t File, with &s;even others of his Me|lancholy Brethren on <HI>Friday</HI> the 27th of <HI>January.</HI> But their drooping Hearts were &s;oon enliven'd again. For the Deputy Mar&s;hal by a Reprieve from the Court of <HI>Kings-Bench</HI> po&s;ting towards <HI>Tyburn</HI> in a Coach through <HI>Hide-Park,</HI> attended his Reception there, where the Croud was &s;o thick, that he could not po&s;&s;ibly get up to the Captain but by mounting a Hor&s;e to make his way through the Pre&s;s. The Captain was then dre&s;t in a fine Silk Night-Gown, a large white Wig, and a white Beaver-Hat; all which per&s;onal Imbelli&s;hments more highly attracted a great many favourable, if not &s;ome wet Eyes, and po&s;&s;ible more particularly entituled him to that la&s;t univer&s;al Civility always paid to his circum&s;tances; <HI>viz. That every Man's hand&s;ome that goes to be hang'd.</HI> But when his Reprieve came, there was no &s;mall repeated Shouts among&s;t his numerous
<PB N="29" REF="16">Spectators. From thence pre&s;ently mounted behind a Rugged|fac'd Man-catcher of the <HI>Poultrey-Compter,</HI> his particular Friend, and as to the A&s;pect much more the Butcher of the two; and under a Detachment of &s;ome other of the Halbeteers he was with great Joy u&s;her'd back towards <HI>Newgate;</HI> where by the way, to take a cheering Cup, he was convey'd to the <HI>Fountain</HI> Tavern on <HI>Snow-Hill,</HI> and entertain'd for near two hours to the Tune of Two and twenty &s;hillings Reckoning: For which his afore&s;aid hard-favour'd <HI>Poultrey-Steward,</HI> at that time being not &s;trong in pocket, for want of the <HI>Rhino,</HI> very kindly dropt his Silver Sword at the Bar, as honourable Guarrantee for the &s;aid &s;um. During his Entertainment here, the Hou&s;e was &s;o throng'd, that the Landlord was forc'd to be at the charge of Watch and Ward to keep his Door; and 'twas no &s;mall Ticket could gain Admi&s;&s;ion. Acce&s;s being &s;o difficult, among&s;t the other crouding Vi&s;itants, were four pa&s;&s;ionate Females, being a French Baud, and three of her fair Nur&s;ery, who though they were Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of but little Engli&s;h, had happily &s;o much French Stratagem, that coming all dre&s;t in white Sarcenet-Hoods, Night-Rails, and white Aprons, they pretended they had been at the Gallows with a de&s;ign to have begg'd his Life, and therefore de&s;ired the honour of coming to the &s;peech of him: So generous a preten|&s;ion &s;oon made their way up to him; but the Captain being al|together a &s;tranger to 'em, and truly a little wanting Faith, gave 'em but a &s;hort, and not over courteous Reception. However this &s;hort-&s;natcht Ble&s;&s;ing had tho&s;e tran&s;porting Effects, that our four white Dam&s;els, with two kind Cullies, their warm Companions, made a <HI>Jubilee</HI> Afternoon on't, the Revel not concluding till pa&s;t Twelve at Night, in which time they made a hard &s;hift to &s;uck up Thirty &s;hillings in good &s;oft Sack, in which 'twas ob&s;erved that the dear Captain's often repeated Health made it go &s;o glibly down, that in truth they &s;taled as much as they drank.</P>
<P>But to return to our Captain, this &s;hort-liv'd Reprieve was attended by a new Summons to Mortality; <HI>viz.</HI> a new Warrant received on <HI>Sunday</HI> Morning following for his Execution at the May Pole in the <HI>Strand</HI> on <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> next the fir&s;t of <HI>February.</HI> Here our Wager Men's Hearts began to beat again; and for a &s;uitable Accommodation for his Funeral Gue&s;ts, a great many Scaffolds were accordingly built, and &s;eats be&s;poken at pretty lumping Prices, in Balconies, Windows, Turrets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 word"> their
<PB N="30" REF="17">great defeat, by Virtue of a &s;econd Warrant not received till late on <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> night, the Tragick Scene was chang'd to St. <HI>Johns-Street</HI> between <HI>Hicks Hall,</HI> and <HI>Smithfield Bars.</HI> Hither accord|ingly our departing Capt to bid the World adieu, was u&s;her'd with the u&s;ual Formalities; and po&s;&s;ibly this la&s;t Exit Scene was cho|&s;en for him, on purpo&s;e to take his farewel among&s;t his own Original Fraternity, the Brothers of the Pole-axe and Cleaver, the <HI>Smithfield Bar</HI> Neighbourhood; and partly as a rebuke to their over in&s;olent rejoycings at his Reprieve, and over ha&s;ty confidence of his Life and Pardon.</P>
<P>But now to &s;hake hands with the Rover, and to take a little Di&s;cour&s;e with the Chri&s;tian at parting. We mu&s;t do his Me|mory this Right, that not only his whole Behaviour in the Pri|&s;on was all along very Mode&s;t and Serious; but after his Sen|tence he was &s;o &s;en&s;ibly toucht with the Thoughts of Death, that he made a con&s;iderable Preparation for appearing before a Higher Tribunal. 'Tis true he did not think fit in all his peni|tence to oblige the World with any particular Detection of his Accomplices, or the Arraignment of any other &s;ins but his own. And at the Place of Execution (where he received the favour of about an hour and a halfs preparation for Eternity) he was extreamly penitent, pray'd heartily for the King, acknowledg|ing his grateful Thanks for his kind five days Reprieve, owning Charity to all Mankind, and dying with all the Symptoms of the mo&s;t fervent Zeal and Devotion.</P>
