<P>_WHereas the Kings mo&s;t Excellent Maje&s;ty, for many weighty and important rea|&s;ons, hath prepared a Royal Navy, which is now ready to &s;et to Sea, and to be employed on &s;uch de&s;igns as His Maje&s;ty, by the Advice of His Council, hath or &s;hall direct, for the Honour and Safety of His Maje&s;ties Realms and Dominions. And whereas by the Laws of this Realm, every Mariner, Sea-man and Soul|dier, receiving Pre&s;s-money to &s;erve the King in any of His Ships, and after re|fu&s;ing to &s;erve, or ab&s;enting him&s;elf at the time and place appointed unto him for his Service, doth incur the danger and penalty of Felony, and is to be puni&s;hed, and forfeit as a Felon. Neverthele&s;s His Maje&s;ty is informed that &s;everal Mariners, Sea-men and Souldiers Pre&s;&s;ed for His Service, and having received Pre&s;s-money, do neglect to repair to, and di&s;ert the &s;aid Service, whereby His Ships may be unfurni&s;hed, and His Service di&s;appointed, to the Di&s;honour of His Maje&s;ty, and danger of His People, e&s;pecially in this time when Foreigners are ready prepared to infe&s;t His Dominions, and deprive His Subjects of their priviledge of Trade, and

His Maje&s;ty therefore in His Princely Wi&s;dom and Providence, fore&s;eeing the incon|veniences which may en&s;ue, hath thought fit, with the Advice of His Privy Council, to publi&s;h this His Royal Proclamation, and doth hereby &s;traitly Charge and Command all Mariners, Sea-men and Souldiers, who are, or &s;hall hereafter be Pre&s;&s;ed for His Service in any Ships or Ve&s;&s;els belong|ing to the &s;aid Navy, and have received, or &s;hall receive Pre&s;s-money for that purpo&s;e, That they duely repair and come to the places, and at the times appointed unto them, and there continue in the Service unto which they are or &s;hall be re&s;pectively Commanded, upon pain of death, and all &s;uch other Pains, Penalties and Forfeitures, as by the Law can be inflicted or impo&s;ed upon them: And for the &s;peedy and effectual pro&s;ecution of &s;uch Offenders, His Maje&s;ty hath thought fit, and doth intend forthwith to i&s;&s;ue Commi&s;&s;ions of <HI>Oyer</HI> and <HI>Terminer</HI> for their Legal Tryal and Puni&s;hment according to Iu&s;tice. And for the better execution of this His Royal intention, doth hereby Charge and Command all and &s;ingular Lieutenants, Deputy-Lieutenants, Mayors, Sheriffs, Iu&s;tices of the Peace, Bayliffs, Con&s;tables, Headboroughs, and other His Officers, Mini&s;ters and Subjects what&s;oever, within any of His Realms or Dominions, with all care and diligence to make &s;earch for, di&s;cover and appre|hend all and every per&s;on and per&s;ons offending as afore&s;aid; and &s;uch as &s;hall be apprehended, forth|with to Commit, or cau&s;e to be Committed to the next Goal of the County, City, or place where they &s;hall be &s;o apprehended, there to remain until they &s;hall be duely proceeded again&s;t, and delivered by cour&s;e of Law: And that the names of the per&s;ons &s;o Apprehended and Committed, be forthwith &s;ent to His Maje&s;ty or Privy Council, that care may be taken for their &s;peedy pro&s;ecution accordingly.</P>
