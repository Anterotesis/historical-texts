<L>I vndertooke my Voyage downe the <HI>Thames.</HI></L>

<L>Then after many farewels, Cups and Glasses,</L>

<L>About the waste or <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Noone if you'le take it so.</NOTE> Nauell of the Day,</L>
<L>Not being dry or Drunke, I went my way.</L>
<L>Our Wherry somewhat olde, or strucke in age,</L>
<L>That had endur'd neere 4. yeares Pilgrimage,</L>
<L>And caryed honest people, Whores, and Thieues,</L>
<L>Some Sergeants, Bayliffes, and some <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Boats are like Bar|bars Chairs Hackneyes or Whores: common to all estates.</NOTE> vnder-Shrieues,</L>
<L>And now at last it was her lot to be</L>
<L>Th'aduent'rous bonny Barke to carry me.</L>
<L>But as an olde Whores Beauty being gone</L>
<L>Hides Natures wracke, with Artlike painting on:</L>
<L><PB REF="4">So I with Colours finely did repaire</L>
<L>My Boates defaults, and made her fresh and faire.</L>
<L>Thus being furnish'd with good Wine and Beere,</L>
<L>And Bread and Meate (to banish hungers feare)</L>
<L>With Sayles, with Ancker, Cables, Sculs and Oares,</L>
<L>With Carde and Compasse, to know Seas and Shores,</L>
<L>With Lanthorne, Candle, Tinder-box and Match,</L>
<L>And with good Courage, to worke, ward, and watch,</L>
<L>Well man'd, well ship'd, well victual'd, well appointed,</L>
<L>Well in good health, well timberd and well joynted:</L>
<L>All wholly well, and yet not halfe Fox'd well,</L>
<L>Twixt <HI>Kent,</HI> and <HI>Essex,</HI> we to <HI>Grauesend</HI> fell.</L>
<L>There I had welcome of my friendly Host,</L>
<L>(A Grauesend Trencher, and a Grauesend Tost)</L>
<L>Good meate and Lodging at an easie Rate,</L>
<L>And rose betimes although I lay downe late.</L>
<L>Bright <HI>Lucifer</HI> the messenger of Day,</L>
<L>His burnisht twinkling splendour did display:</L>
<L>Rose cheek'd <HI>Aurora</HI> hid her blushing face,</L>
<L>She spying <HI>Phoebus</HI> comming gaue him place.</L>
<L>Whilest <HI>Zephirus,</HI> and <HI>Auster,</HI> mix'd together,</L>
<L>Breath'd gently, as fore-boding pleasant weather.</L>
<L>Olde <HI>Neptune</HI> had his Daughter <HI>Thames</HI> supplide,</L>
<L>With ample measure of a flowing Tide,</L>
<L>But <HI>Thames</HI> supposde it was but borrowed goods,</L>
<L>And with her Ebbes, payde <HI>Neptune</HI> backe his Floods.</L>
<L>Then at the time of this Auspicious dawning,</L>
<L>I rowz'd my men, who Scrubbing, stretching, yawning,</L>
<L>Arose, left <HI>Grauesend,</HI> Rowing downe the streame,</L>
<L>And neere to <HI>Lee,</HI> wee to an Ancker came.</L>
<L>Because the Sands were bare, and Water lowe,</L>
<L>We rested there, till it two houres did Flowe:</L>
<L><PB REF="4">And then to trauell went our Galley foyst,</L>
<L>Our Ancker quickly weigh'd, our sayle soone hoyst,</L>
<L>Where thirty miles we past, a mile from shore,</L>
<L>The water two <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">These star Sands are called the Spi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter">s.</NOTE> foote deepe, or little more.</L>
<L>Thus past we on the braue East Saxon Coast,</L>
<L>From 3. at morne, till 2. at noone almost,</L>
<L>By <HI>Shobury, Wakering, Fowlenesse, Tittingham,</HI></L>
<L>And then wee into deeper water came.</L>
<L>There is a crooked Bay runnes winding farre,</L>
<L>To <HI>Maulden, Esterford,</HI> and <HI>Colchester,</HI></L>
<L>Which cause 'twas much about, (to ease mens paine)</L>
<L>I left the Land, and put into the mayne.</L>
<L>With speed, the crooked way to scape and passe,</L>
<L>I made out straight for <HI>Frinton,</HI> and the <HI>Nasse.</HI></L>
<L>But being 3. Leagues then from any Land,</L>
<L>And holding of our Maine sheate in my hand,</L>
<L>We did espy a coleblacke Cloud to rise,</L>
<L>Fore-runner of some Tempest from the Skies;</L>
<L>Scarce had we sayl'd a hundred times our length,</L>
<L>But that the winde began to gather strength:</L>
<L>Stiffe <HI>Eolus,</HI> with <HI>Neptune</HI> went to Cuffes,</L>
<L>With huffes, and puffes, and angry counter-Buffes,</L>
<L>From boyst'rous Gusts, they fell to fearefull flawes,</L>
<L>Whilest we 'twixt winde &amp; water, neere Death's iawes</L>
<L>Tost like a Corke vpon the mounting maine,</L>
<L>Vp with a whiffe, and straight way downe againe,</L>
<L>At which we in our mindes much troubled were,</L>
<L>And said <HI>God blesse vs all, what Wethers heere</HI>?</L>
<L>For (in a worde) the Seas so high did growe,</L>
<L>That Ships were forc'd to strike their topsailes lowe,</L>
<L>Meane time (before the winde) wee scudded braue,</L>
<L>Much like a Ducke, on top of euery waue.</L>
<L><PB REF="5">But nothing violent is permanent,</L>
<L>And in short space away the Tempest went.</L>
<L>So farewell it; and you that Readers be</L>
<L>Suppose it was no welcome Guest to me:</L>
<L>My Company and I, it much perplext,</L>
<L>And let it come when I send for it next.</L>
<L>But leauing jesting, Thankes to God I giue,</L>
<L>Twas through his mercy wee did scape and liue.</L>
<L>And though these thinges with mirth I doe expresse,</L>
<L>Yet still I thinke on God with thankefulnes.</L>
<L>Thus ceast the Storme and weather gan to smile,</L>
<L>And we Row'd neere the shoare of <HI>Horsey</HI> Ile.</L>
<L>Then did Illustrious <HI>Titan</HI> seeme to steepe</L>
<L>His Chariot in the Westerne Ocean deepe:</L>
<L>We saw the farre spent Day, withdraw his light,</L>
<L>And made for <HI>Harwich,</HI> where we lay all night.</L>
<L>There did I finde an Hostesse with a Tongue,</L>
<L>As nimble as it had on Gimmols hung:</L>
<L>Twill neuer tire, though it continuall toyl'd,</L>
<L>And went as yare, as if it had bin Oyl'd:</L>
<L>All's one for that, for ought which I perceiue,</L>
<L>It is a fault which all our Mothers haue:</L>
<L>And is so firmely grafted in the Sexe,</L>
<L>That hee's an Asse that seemes thereat to vexe.</L>
<L><HI>Apolloes</HI> Beames began to guild the Hils,</L>
<L>And West Southwest the winde the Welkin fils.</L>
<L>When I left <HI>Harwich,</HI> and along we Row'd</L>
<L>Against a smooth Calme flood that stifly flow'd,</L>
<L>By <HI>Bawdsey</HI> Hauen, and by <HI>Orford Nasse,</HI></L>
<L>And so by <HI>Aldbrough</HI> we at last did passe.</L>
<L>By <HI>Lestoffe,</HI> we to <HI>Yarmouth</HI> made our way,</L>
<L>Our third dayes trauell being Saturday,</L>
<L><PB REF="5">There did I see a Towne well fortifide,</L>
<L>Well gouern'd, with all Natures wants supplide,</L>
<L>The scituation in a wholesome ayre,</L>
<L>The Buildings (for the most part) sumptuous, faire,</L>
<L>The people courteous, and industrious, and</L>
<L>With labour makes the Sea inrich the land.</L>
<L>Besides (for aught I know) this one thing more,</L>
<L>The Towne can scarcely yeeld a man a Whore:</L>
<L>It is renownd for fishing farre and neere,</L>
<L>And sure in <HI>Britaine</HI> it hath not a Peere.</L>
<L>But noble <HI>Nash</HI> thy fame shall liue alwayes,</L>

<P>A Booke called the praise of the red Herring.</P></NOTE> Herrings praise</L>
<L>Hath done great <HI>Yarmouth</HI> much renowned right,</L>
<L>And put my Artlesse Muse to silence quite:</L>
<L>On Sunday we a learned Sermon had,</L>
<L>Taught to confirme the good, reforme the bad;</L>
<L>Acquaintance in the Towne I scarce had any,</L>
<L>And sought for none, in feare to finde too many,</L>
<L>Much kindnesse to me by mine Host was done,</L>
<L>(A Marriner <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">And a ship Car|penter.</NOTE> nam'd <HI>William Richardson</HI>)</L>
<L>Besides mine Hostesse gaue to me at last</L>
<L>A Cheese, with which at Sea we brake our fast,</L>
<L>The Guift was round, and had no end indeede,</L>
<L>But yet we made an end of it with speede:</L>
<L>My thanks surmounts her bounty, all men sees</L>
<L>My Gratitudes in Print: But where's the <HI>Cheese</HI>?</L>
<L>So on the Munday, betwixt one and twaine,</L>
<L>I tooke my leaue, and put to Sea againe.</L>
<L>Down <HI>Yarmouth</HI> Roade we Row'd with cutting speed,</L>
<L>(The Wind all quiet, Armes must doe the deed)</L>
<L>Along by <HI>Castor,</HI> and Sea-bord'ring Townes,</L>
<L>Whose Cliffes &amp; shores abide sterne <HI>Neptunes</HI> frownes,</L>
<L><PB REF="6">Sometimes a mile from land, and sometimes two,</L>
<L>(As depthes or sands permitted vs to do)</L>
<L>Till drawing toward night, we did perceaue</L>
<L>The wind at East, and Seas began to heaue:</L>
<L>The rowling Billowes all in fury Roares</L>
<L>And tumbled vs, we scarce could vse our Oares:</L>
<L>Thus on a Lee shore, darknesse gan to come,</L>
<L>The Sea grew high, the winds gan hisse and hum:</L>
<L>The foaming curled waues the shore did beate,</L>
<L>(As if the Ocean would all <HI>Norfolke</HI> eate)</L>
<L>To keepe at Sea, was dangerous I did thinke,</L>
<L>To goe to land I stood in doubt to sinke:</L>
<L>Thus landing, or not landing (I suppos'd)</L>
<L>We were in perill <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">We were in a puz|zell.</NOTE> round about inclos'd;</L>
<L>At last to Rowe to shore I thought it best,</L>
<L>'Mongst many euils, thinking that the least:</L>
<L>My men all pleas'd to doe as I command,</L>
<L>Did turne the Boates head opposite to land,</L>
<L>And with the highest Waue that I could spie,</L>
<L>I bad them Row to shore immediatly.</L>
<L>When straite we all leap'd ouer-boord in hast,</L>
<L>Some to the knees, and some vp to the waste,</L>
<L>Where suddainly t'wixt Owle-light and the darke,</L>
<L>We pluck'd the Boat beyond high water marke.</L>
<L>And thus halfe sowsde, halfe stewd, with Sea and sweat,</L>
<L>We land at <HI>Cromer</HI> Towne halfe dry, halfe wet.</L>
<L>But we supposing all was safe and well</L>
<L>In shunning <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">We were like Floun|ders aliue in a frying Pan, that leap'd into the fire to saue them|selues.</NOTE> <HI>Silla,</HI> on <HI>Caribdis</HI> fell:</L>
<L>For why some women, and some children there</L>
<L>That saw vs land, were all possest with feare:</L>
<L>And much amaz'd, ranne crying vp and downe,</L>
<L>That Enemies were come to take the Towne.</L>
<L><PB REF="6">Some said that we were Pyrats, some said Theeues,</L>
<L>And what the women saies, the men beleeues.</L>
<L>With that foure Constables did quickly call,</L>
<L>Your ayde! to Armes you men of <HI>Cromer</HI> all!</L>
<L>Then straitway forty men with rusty Bills,</L>
<L>Some arm'd in Ale, all of approued skills,</L>
<L>Deuided into foure stout Regiments,</L>
<L>To guard the Towne from dangerous Euents;</L>
<L>Braue Captaine <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">These were the names of the cum|bersome <HI>Cromorian</HI> Consta|bles.</NOTE> <HI>Pescod</HI> did the Vantguard lead,</L>
<L>And Captaine <HI>Clarke</HI> the Rereward gouerned,</L>
<L>Whilst Captaine <HI>Wiseman,</HI> and hot Captaine <HI>Kimble,</HI></L>
<L>Were in the mayne Battalia fierce and nimble:</L>
<L>One with his squadron watch'd me all the night,</L>
<L>Least from my lodging I should take my flight:</L>
<L>A second (like a man of speciall note)</L>
<L>Did by the Sea side all night watch my Boate,</L>
<L>The other two, to make their names Renownd,</L>
<L>Did Guard the Towne, and brauely walke the Rownd.</L>
<L>And thus my Boat, my selfe, and all my men,</L>
<L>Were stoutly Guarded, and Regarded then:</L>
<L>For they were all so full with feare possest,</L>
<L>That without mirth it cannot be exprest.</L>
<L>My Inuention doth Curuet, my Muse doth Caper,</L>
<L>My Pen doth daunce out lines vpon the Paper,</L>
<L>And in a word, I am as full of mirth,</L>
<L>As Mighty men are at their first sonnes birth.</L>
<L>Me thinkes <HI>Moriscoes</HI> are within my braines,</L>
<L>And <HI>Heyes</HI> and <HI>Antiques</HI> run through all my vaines:</L>
<L>Heigh, to the tune of <HI>Trenchmoore</HI> I could write</L>
<L>The valient men of <HI>Cromers</HI> sad affright:</L>
<L>As Sheepe doe feare the Wolfe, or Geese the Fox,</L>
<L>So all amazed were these sencelesse blockes:</L>
<L><PB REF="7">That had the Towne beene fir'd, it is a doubt,</L>
<L>But that the women there had pist it out,</L>
<L>And from the men Reek'd such a fearefull sent,</L>
<L>That People three <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">People did come thither 3. or 4. miles about, to know what the matter was.</NOTE> miles thence mus'd what it meant,</L>
<L>And he the truth that narrowly had sifted,</L>
<L>Had found the Constables, had need t'haue shifted.</L>
<L>They did examine me, I answer'd than</L>
<L>I was <HI>Iohn Taylor,</HI> and a Waterman,</L>
<L>And that my honest fellow <HI>Iob</HI> and I,</L>
<L>Were seruants to <HI>King Iames</HI> his Maistie,</L>
<L>How we to <HI>Yorke,</HI> vpon a Mart were bound,</L>
<L>And that we landed, fearing to be drownd:</L>
<L>When all this would not satisfie the Crew,</L>
<L>I freely op'd my Trunke, and bad them view,</L>
<L>I shew'd them Bookes, of Chronicles and Kings,</L>
<L>Some Prose, some verse, and idle Sonnettings,</L>
<L>I shewed them all my Letters to the full,</L>
<L>Some to <HI>Yorkes</HI> Archbishop, and some to <HI>Hull,</HI></L>
<L>But had the twelue Apostles sure beene there</L>
<L>My witnesses, I had beene nere the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">I had as good to haue said nothing.</NOTE> neere.</L>
<L>And let me vse all Oathes that I could vse,</L>
<L>They still were harder of beliefe then Iewes.</L>
<L>They wanted faith, and had resolu'd before,</L>
<L>Not to belieue what e're we said or swore.</L>
<L>They said the world was full of much deceit,</L>
<L>And that my Letters might be <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Diligent Officers.</NOTE> counterfeit:</L>
<L>Besides, there's one thing bred the more dislike,</L>
<L>Because mine Host was knowne a Catholike.</L>
<L>These things concurring, people came in Clusters,</L>
<L>And multitudes within my lodging Musters,</L>
<L>That I was almost wooried vnto death,</L>
<L>In danger to be stifled with their breath.</L>
<L><PB REF="7">And had mine Host tooke pence a peece of those</L>
<L>Who came to gaze on me, I doe suppose,</L>
<L>No <HI>Iack</HI> an <HI>Apes, Baboone,</HI> or <HI>Crocodile</HI></L>
<L>'Ere got more money in so small a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The dan|cing on the Ropes, or a Puppet play, had come short of his ta|kings, ac|counting time for time.</NOTE> while.</L>
<L>Besides, the Pesants did this one thing more,</L>
<L>They call'd and dranke foure shillings on my score:</L>
<L>And like vnmanner'd Mungrells went their way,</L>
<L>Not spending aught, but leauing me to <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">This was more then I could willingly afford.</NOTE> pay.</L>
<L>This was the houshold businesse, in meane space</L>
<L>Some Rascals ran vnto my Boate apace,</L>
<L>And turn'd and tumbled her, like men of <HI>Goteham,</HI></L>
<L>Quite topsie turuy vpward with her bottome,</L>
<L>Vowing they would in tatters piece-meale teare,</L>
<L>The cursed Pyrates Boate, that bred their feare;</L>
<L>And I am sure, their madnesse (to my harme)</L>
<L>Tore a Boord out, much longer then mine arme.</L>
<L>And they so bruis'd, and split our Wherry, that</L>
<L>She leak'd, we cast out water with a Hat.</L>

<L>To feare we would a Market Towne surprise!</L>
