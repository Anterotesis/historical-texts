<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>IF we peru&s;e the Hi&s;tories of the Ancients, we &s;hall find the <HI>Mediterranean Sea</HI> to have been the fir&s;t mo&s;t Eminent <HI>Neptunean</HI> Theater of Blood and Slaughter. And the &s;ame Stories tell us, with A&s;to|ni&s;hment, (for all Exce&s;&s;es are wonderful to Man) of the Naval Force of all the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Empire, quite broken and de&s;troyed at <HI>Artemi&s;ium</HI> by <HI>Euribeas</HI> the <HI>Lace|demonian;</HI> and at <HI>Salamine,</HI> by <HI>Themi&s;tocles</HI> the <HI>A|thenian</HI> Admiral. Succeeding Hi&s;tories relate the Bloody Conte&s;ts of the <HI>Athenians</HI> and <HI>Lacedemonians,</HI> the <HI>Romans</HI> and <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> for the Dominion of the <HI>Mediterranean.</HI> A&s;terwards, we hear of <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> and <HI>Mark Anthony,</HI> covering the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> with Two powerful Fleets, contending for the Empire of al|mo&s;t all the Inhabited World, till the Engagement at <HI>Actium</HI> decided the Controver&s;ie. I might add to the&s;e, a di&s;mal pro&s;pect of the <HI>Genoe&s;es</HI> and <HI>Venetian</HI> Fleets for many Years together, conte&s;ting upon the &s;ame Seas for Superiority: The Two va&s;t Fleets of <HI>Se|lym</HI> the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Sultan, and that of the <HI>Chri|&s;tians</HI> under <HI>Don John</HI> of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> that met near the Bay of <HI>Lepanto,</HI> where the Victory, wre&s;ted from the <HI>Infidels,</HI> within the &s;pace of a few Hours, &s;et at li|berty no le&s;s than <HI>13000 Chri&s;tian</HI> Captives. And la&s;tly, that Invincible <HI>Armada,</HI> with which the King of
<PB REF="3"><HI>Spain</HI> then thought not only to have conquered <HI>England,</HI> but to have freighted the &s;pacious I&s;land it &s;elf, and re|mov'd it into his own Seas. But all the&s;e Numerous Fleets of Gallies, and Cock-boats, would have made but a &s;mall Figure on that Watry Stage, had the Magni|ficent Terror of the Fir&s;t, Second, Third and Fourth Rates, at this pre&s;ent, under the Command of Admiral <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> &s;pread it &s;elf among 'em. Great things are therefore expected from &s;uch a prodigious Force, than which the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> never carried upon her Shoul|ders a more Formidable, &s;ince the <HI>Phaenicians</HI> fir&s;t taught the Art of Sayling. No que&s;tion then, but a ju&s;t and true Account of the Exploits perform'd by &s;uch a Con|gre&s;s of Thunder and Lightning cannot choo&s;e but be acceptable to all the World. Which as we have already began to give, &s;o we &s;hall continue, as Occa&s;ions offer. All that we can &s;ay as yet, though this be al&s;o very great, is only that it has &s;av'd one of the mo&s;t &s;pacious Provinces of <HI>Spain</HI> from the compleat Conquest of an In&s;ulting E|nemy; and that, if any thing of Unhappine&s;s has hitherto attended it, 'tis only that no Oppo&s;ition dares meet it: While <HI>Tourville,</HI> an Admiral now without a Fleet, is &s;o far from pre&s;uming to adventure an Engagement, that he does all he can to &s;ecure his <HI>Terribles</HI> and his <HI>Tri|umphants</HI> with Land Fortifications; afraid to tru&s;t 'em in their proper Elements. Fear makes him avoid the &s;ight of this Formidable Fleet, and Fear makes others court the Terror of it; witne&s;s the Submi&s;&s;ive Language of the haughty <HI>Algerines</HI> to the Admiral that com|mands it. This I &s;ay, is all very great; but as greater things are expected, &s;o there is no que&s;tion but we &s;hall give the World an Account of them, the next time we appear in Print.</P>

<HEAD>A JOURNAL OF THE <HI>ENGLISH</HI> and <HI>D&V;TCH</HI> FLEET, Under the Command of <HI>Admiral Ru&s;&s;el.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ABOUT the end of <HI>April,</HI> in the Year 1694, the Right Honourable Admiral <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> being appointed by his Maje&s;ty to command the Confederate Fleet, then de&s;ign'd for the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea, arrived at <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> and the next Morning after his Arrival there, went on Board the <HI>Britannia.</HI> The whole Fleet which was nu|merou&s;ly formidable, was &s;aid to be vittl'd for Four Months, which made mo&s;t People conclude what was only conjectur'd
<PB N="2" REF="4">before, that &s;uch great Preparations were not intended for a &s;hort Expedition. For it was plainly &s;een by the Letter which the King of <HI>France</HI> &s;ent to the <HI>Bey</HI> of <HI>Algier,</HI> purporting, that he had order'd a Numerous Fleet of 50 Ships of Line of Battel, 20 Bomb-Ve&s;&s;els, and 44 Galleys, into the <HI>Mediter|ranean,</HI> to Bomb and De&s;troy all the Sea-port Towns of <HI>Spain,</HI> that would not pre&s;erve them&s;elves from utter Ruin by large Contributions of Money, and to exact great Sums from <HI>Genoa</HI> and <HI>Legorn,</HI> That <HI>Tourville</HI> was to brave it in the <HI>Le|vant,</HI> and &s;hut up the Pa&s;&s;ages of the Streights in &s;uch a man|ner, that there &s;hould be no Trading for either <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>Dutch;</HI> and for the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> they were to be exterminated out of the Ocean. 'Twas therefore thought convenient to di|vide the Confederate Fleet, and &s;end the greate&s;t part of it un|der Admiral <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> in &s;earch of this &s;ame Threatning Ene|my, in order to fight the Mar&s;hal where e're they found him, if he would &s;tand the &s;hock, and to keep the Seas open for free|dom of Trade.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e, upon the 5th of <HI>May,</HI> he &s;et Sail from St. <HI>Helens,</HI> with part of the Fleet, directing his Cour&s;e We&s;t|ward; the re&s;t of the Men of War remaining behind at the <HI>Spit-head,</HI> under the Command of Sir <HI>Cloud&s;ly Showell,</HI> Vice-Admiral of the Red Squadron.</P>
<P>As he &s;ail'd on, the Admiral had intelligence, that there lay in <HI>Bertume</HI> Road, a con&s;iderable Fleet of <HI>French</HI> Merchant-Men, Ea&s;tward bound. Upon which he &s;ent away Capt. <HI>Pickard</HI> in the <HI>Monmouth,</HI> together with the <HI>Re&s;olution</HI> and <HI>Roebuck</HI> Fire-&s;hip, either to bring them away, or to de&s;troy them. Accordingly upon the 10th of the &s;ame Month, as &s;oon as it was light, they made toward the <HI>French</HI> Shore, about Seven Miles from the Fleet; and by Five a Clock in the Morning, they de&s;erv'd &s;everal Ships behind a Point of Land near <HI>Conquet</HI> Bay; which, immediately upon a Signal given from one of their Scouts, hois'd their Sails. In the mean time Capt. <HI>Pickard</HI> pur&s;u'd the Man of War that was their Convoy, and forc'd her to hale in with the Shore, and run again&s;t the Rocks, under the Ca&s;tle that &s;tood farthe&s;t into the Sea. This Man of War, as the Pri&s;oners afterwards de|clar'd,
<PB N="3" REF="4">hapn'd to be the <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> Frigate, which the <HI>French</HI> had taken from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ome time before, in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and which &s;oon after was blown up, either by Acci|dent or Voluntarily, 'tis not material whether. After this, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men of War &s;tood into <HI>White Bay,</HI> as far as they could with &s;afety, plying the <HI>French</HI> Ships that were there with their great Guns; but their Ve&s;&s;els being 27 in number, all ran a&s;hore together, with as many more in and about <HI>Con|quet.</HI> The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Frigates then &s;tood into <HI>Bertume</HI> Bay, and took one of the Merchants Ships, though the Ca&s;tle ply'd them all the while with their great Shot and Bombs. There were in this Fleet Six Sloops, carrying from Ten to Sixteen Guns, two of which, as the Pri&s;oners confe&s;t, were burnt by the blowing up of the <HI>Jer&s;ey.</HI> There were al&s;o among them, Four Ve&s;&s;els of good Burthen, part of who&s;e Lading was Guns and Mortars, the bigge&s;t of which ran a&s;hore again&s;t the Rocks of St. <HI>Matthew</HI>'s Point. The Merchants Ships were in all about 55 Sail, of which 35 were either burnt or &s;unk, 25 in <HI>White-Bay,</HI> 4 on the South-&s;ide of the Point of the Bay, and 6 on the South-&s;ide of <HI>Conquet,</HI> their Lading being for the mo&s;t part Salt, Wine and Brandy. The News of this Exploit &s;o luckily perform'd, came to <HI>Whitehall</HI> by an Expre&s;s dated from the Fleet, the 18th of <HI>May.</HI></P>
<P>By another Expre&s;s dated the 19th of the &s;ame Month, an Account was given, That Capt. <HI>Town&s;end</HI> in the <HI>Fore&s;ight,</HI> and Capt. <HI>Cooper</HI> in the <HI>England</HI> Frigate, having Four <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pri|vateers in their Company, upon the 17th, about Six a Clock in the Morning, to the Ea&s;t-ward of Cape <HI>la Hogue,</HI> got &s;ight of another Fleet of <HI>French</HI> Merchants, bound for <HI>Diep</HI> and <HI>Dunkirk;</HI> and giving them Cha&s;e, tack'd upon Five of them, one of which happened to be a Man of War of 23 Guns, and ran them all a&s;hore, in a Rocky Place, call'd <HI>Omonvel,</HI> where they were protected by a &s;mall Ca&s;tle. Upon which they made after the re&s;t of the Fleet, and forc'd &s;everal of them a&s;hore near <HI>Sherburg;</HI> and while they kept off the <HI>French</HI> Con|voy, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Privateers took Six of them: The whole Fleet con&s;i&s;ting of about 50 Sail, laden with Corn and Bread for the &s;ervice of the <HI>French</HI> Army in <HI>Flanders.</HI></P>
<PB N="4" REF="5">
<P>This fir&s;t motion of part of the Confederate Fleet, was on|ly to ob&s;erve the Countenances of the <HI>French</HI> in <HI>Bre&s;t,</HI> and to get the be&s;t intelligence that could be had, what Strength they had left behind in the Ocean; for that the Admiral did not &s;ail from S. <HI>Helens</HI> till the 29th of <HI>May</HI> in the Morning, at what time there being but little Wind, and that which was being again&s;t him, he was forced to come to an Anchor a|gain; but at length upon the 30th in the Morning, the Wind choping about to the North with a fre&s;h Gale, the whole Fleet &s;et &s;ail, and before Noon of the &s;ame day, were quite out of fight.</P>
<P>'Tis &s;aid, that the whole Fleet, <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> con&s;i&s;ted of 48 Sail, or 56, as was &s;aid by others; particularly that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet was compo&s;ed of 3 Fir&s;t Rates, the <HI>Britannia,</HI> the <HI>Sovereign,</HI> and the St. <HI>Andrew;</HI> 6 of the Second, 18 of the Third, 6 of which carried 80 great Guns apiece; 6 of the Fourth, 2 of the Fifth, 6 of the Sixth, together with 9 Fire-Ships: which were to be reinforced by 23 Sail more, that lay at <HI>Cadiz,</HI> and to be farther al&s;o joyn'd by the Men of War, and Galleys of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time, <HI>Nouailles</HI> being ready to take the Field in <HI>Catalogna, Tourville</HI> was &s;ent down to <HI>Toulon,</HI> to ha&s;ten out the <HI>French</HI> Fleet with all the &s;peed imaginable; and he was &s;o quick, that he was got with a Squdron of Men of War in|to the Road of <HI>Toulon,</HI> and was ready to &s;et Sail. But upon the 9th of <HI>May,</HI> &s;o violent a Storm, attended with Thunder and Lightning, aro&s;e in tho&s;e Parts, that the Admirals Ship; and Two more, were &s;o much endamag'd in their Ma&s;ts, that it was the 14th before he could put to Sea, in order to joyn the Galleys, and &s;o &s;et fayl together towards the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Catalogna,</HI> where he was to a&s;&s;i&s;t with his Bombs from the Sea, while the <HI>French</HI> attacked the Sea-port Towns of that Province by Land. To that purpo&s;e, he &s;ail'd away with the Galleys from <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> to the Bay of <HI>Ro&s;es,</HI> where he was joyn'd by <HI>Cha&s;teau Renaut,</HI> with a Squadron from <HI>Bre&s;t.</HI></P>
<PB N="5" REF="5">
<P>And now the <HI>French</HI> carri'd all things before them in <HI>Ca|talogna; Tourville</HI> rode Triumphant at Sea, and <HI>Nouailles,</HI> Vi|ctorious by Land; had won <HI>Palamos</HI> and <HI>Gironne,</HI> and there was no que&s;tion but that <HI>Barcellona</HI> would have been the next that would have been Be&s;ieg'd; which &s;eem'd indeed to be the principal De&s;ign of that Campaign. But the Ti|dings that Admiral <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> was approaching toward the <HI>Streights,</HI> quite alter'd the Mea&s;ures of the <HI>French;</HI> &s;o that <HI>Tourville</HI> in&s;tead of &s;ailing from <HI>Palamos</HI> to <HI>Barcellona</HI> according to his Fir&s;t Orders, was directed to return to <HI>Toulon,</HI> with all the ha&s;t he could. And indeed 'twas a lucky E&s;cape for the <HI>French</HI> Admiral, who got into <HI>Toulon</HI> but the 4th of <HI>July;</HI> whereas Admiral <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> as the Letters from <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> at that time confirm'd, appear'd at the heighth of <HI>Barcellona</HI> the 7th.</P>
<P>However it were, it was not to be imagin'd, that the Confederate Fleet, which could &s;ail no fa&s;ter than the Wind could carry them along, and of who&s;e Motion the <HI>French</HI> Court was able to give more &s;peedy Intelligence, and as much as was nece&s;&s;ary for <HI>Tourville</HI>'s Pre&s;ervation, more conveniently than the Admiral could ha&s;ten to prevent it; for the&s;e Rea|&s;ons, I &s;ay, it was not to be imagin'd, that the Confederate Fleet could ea&s;ily &s;urprize the <HI>French.</HI> After the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ad|miral had weigh'd, and &s;et forward from St. <HI>Hellens,</HI> there was little or no News heard of him; only that he was &s;een to pa&s;s at a di&s;tance by <HI>Dartmouth</HI> and <HI>Plimouth</HI> the 5th of <HI>June;</HI> and that upon the Ninth at Night, the <HI>Alliance</HI> Packet-Boat bound from <HI>Corona</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> in her Voyage to <HI>Fal|mouth,</HI> di&s;cover'd a great number of Lights to the South We&s;t of <HI>&V;&s;hant,</HI> which he judg'd to be the Fleet under Admiral <HI>Ru&s;&s;el.</HI> To which we may add the Report of the Ma&s;ter of another Ve&s;&s;el which put into <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> and about the &s;ame time, brought Advice, that he met Admiral <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> in the heighth of <HI>Lagos,</HI> in <HI>Portugal,</HI> &s;teering toward the <HI>Streights</HI> with a favourable Wind. So that after it was heard, that he had doubled the Cape of St. <HI>Vincent,</HI> between <HI>Lisbon</HI> and <HI>Ca|diz,</HI> the fir&s;t Expre&s;s that came from him, and was received at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> was dated on Board the <HI>Britannia,</HI> the fir&s;t of
<PB N="6" REF="6"><HI>July,</HI> Old Stile, off of <HI>Tangier,</HI> wherein the Admiral gave an Account that he had not &s;o much as touch'd at <HI>Cadiz,</HI> but that he had &s;ent Orders to Rear Admiral <HI>Nevil,</HI> who rode in that Bay, with a Squadron of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Men of War, to joyn him to the We&s;tward of Cape <HI>Spartel;</HI> which they accordingly did on the 30th of <HI>June.</HI> Farther, that when tho&s;e Letters were written, he was ha&s;tning with all the &s;peed he could toward <HI>Barcellona,</HI> being inform'd that the <HI>French</HI> Fleet lay between that Place and <HI>Alfagues.</HI> That he had likewi&s;e order'd the <HI>Turkey</HI> Ships both <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> together with the Men of War appointed for their Convoy, to make the be&s;t of their way to <HI>Cartagena,</HI> and there to &s;tay for &s;uch farther Orders which he &s;hould &s;end them from <HI>Alicant,</HI> according to the Intelligence which he &s;hould re|ceive of the Enemy.</P>
<P>Upon the 13th of <HI>July,</HI> the &s;ame welcom News was &s;ent by an Expre&s;s from <HI>Cadiz</HI> to <HI>Madrid,</HI> where the Tydings were joyfully received in the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Court, that Admiral <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> had pa&s;&s;ed by that Harbour with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet toward the <HI>Streights,</HI> having &s;ent in a &s;mall Frigate before, with Orders to Rear Admiral <HI>Nevil,</HI> to joyn him near Cape <HI>Spartel.</HI> This Frigate arriv'd at <HI>Cadiz</HI> the 8th of the &s;ame Month, and the next Morning the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Squa|dron, together with Ten Spani&s;h Men of War which lay in that Bay, &s;ail'd away all together with a fair Wind. And now fearle&s;s of Mole&s;tation, divers Satees and other &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els were order'd from <HI>Cadiz,</HI> Port St. <HI>Mary,</HI> and St. <HI>Lu|car,</HI> freighted with above 2000 Souldiers and Sea-men, for the Succour of <HI>Barcellona,</HI> to <HI>Malaga;</HI> where lay Six Galleys ready to convoy them, with Sixteen more that were gon before to <HI>Cartagena,</HI> in expectation of others that were to joyn them, which being joyn'd, would make Twenty Eight in all, and were to attend the main Fleet, or at lea&s;t the greate&s;t part of them.</P>
<P>Upon the 23d of <HI>July,</HI> an Expre&s;s from <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> brought News to the Court at <HI>Madrid,</HI> that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Squadron commanded by Rear Admiral <HI>Nevil,</HI> and the Ten <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Men of War, had joyn'd Admiral <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> upon the

<P>Upon the 17th of <HI>July,</HI> Capt. <HI>Banks</HI> in the <HI>Car&s;lile</HI> Frigate, with Four Ketches, was &s;ent to <HI>Malaga,</HI> to &s;etch fre&s;h Pro|vi&s;ions for the Fleet, which he rejoyn'd the next day, &s;till directing its cour&s;e for <HI>Barcellona:</HI> For the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Admiral thought it not convenient to come in &s;ight of <HI>Malaga,</HI> but pa&s;s'd by it the &s;ame day that he &s;ent Capt. <HI>Banks</HI> thither, keeping more to the Shore of <HI>Barbary.</HI> All this while no <HI>French</HI> Fleet appear'd; only Six of their Men of War were &s;een off <HI>Almeria,</HI> upon the 13th, where they would have had Provi&s;ions for their Money, but it was refus'd them; they being &s;uppos'd to be Scouts &s;ent forth to get intelli|gence of the Confederate Fleet. In the mean time, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchants Ships bound for <HI>Turkey</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> under the Convoy of Five Men of War, proceeded unmole&s;ted in their Voyages.</P>
<P>On the 8th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> Admiral <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> arrived before <HI>Bar|cellona</HI> with the whole Fleet, con&s;i&s;ting of about 140 Sail, of which 88 were Ships of Line. He had met with &s;everal Re|mora's, occa&s;ion'd by contrary Winds, which render'd the Voyage &s;omewhat Tedious, though every Moment were im|prov'd to ha&s;ten it. Of this Mar&s;hal <HI>Novailles</HI> gave the King of <HI>France</HI> advice, by an Expre&s;s from his Camp at <HI>Blaines,</HI> (not far from <HI>Barcellona</HI>) adding withal, that while Admiral <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> anchor'd before the City, Two and Twenty of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Galleys came before the Place; and making in as clo&s;e to the Shore as they could, Canonado'd the <HI>French</HI> Troops that were po&s;ted near the Shoar.</P>
<P>Admiral <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> continu'd before <HI>Barcellona</HI> with the whole Fleet riding in Three Lines, from the 8th to the 26th, at what time he weigh'd, and the next day appear'd before <HI>Blaines,</HI> which is about Four Leagues from <HI>Palamos.</HI> And there was no que&s;tion but the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Admiral would have been glad that Mar&s;hal <HI>Tourville</HI> would have tarry'd for his coming. But
<PB N="8" REF="7">upon the News of his Approach to the <HI>Streights,</HI> or, at lea&s;t, of his having pa&s;s'd the <HI>Streights,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Admiral in&s;tead of Sailing to <HI>Barcellona</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t <HI>Nouailles</HI> in the Siege of that Place, according to his fir&s;t Orders, made a &s;peedy return to <HI>Toulon,</HI> and was &s;o early in his Retreat, that he enter'd that Port upon the 4th of <HI>July.</HI> And &s;uch was his fear of being a&s;&s;ayl'd in the Harbour, that he &s;ent away &s;ome part of the Galleys to <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> and moor'd the re&s;t before his Men of War for their better Security: And more than this, he took out the great Guns out of the great Men of War, to make Batteries upon the Shore; for the rai&s;ing of which, his Men wrought Day and Night, and of which he try'd the firm|ne&s;s, and how far they were able to annoy an A&s;&s;ayling Ene|my, after they were fini&s;h'd. He al&s;o caus'd the bigge&s;t of his Ships to be hail'd within the Ca&s;tles. He al&s;o caus'd &s;e|veral Pieces of Canon to be planted upon the I&s;lands near <HI>Mar&s;ailles.</HI> And &s;till for the &s;ecurity of the great Ships at <HI>Toulon,</HI> he order'd moreover a &s;trong Chain and a Boom to be laid cro&s;s the Entrance of the Port. Nor was all this thought &s;ufficient, till be&s;ides all the&s;e Precautions, he had rais'd a New Fort, which was call'd <HI>Fort Tourville,</HI> to defend the en|trance into the Haven.</P>
<P>This was a &s;ign, that the <HI>French</HI> Admiral lay under great Apprehen&s;ions of Danger; and yet in the mid&s;t of the&s;e fears, it was then reported, that <HI>Tourville</HI> held a Council of War, wherein it was debated, whether he &s;hould put to Sea and fight the Confederate Fleet, upon an Imagination that the Sea-men were tyr'd out with the length of their Voyage, and Sickly; upon which Suppo&s;itions, he thought there might be &s;ome Advantage gain'd. But it was carri'd in the Nega|tive, all the Officers alledging, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> were no fre&s;h-water Souldiers, and therefore that it would be a Madne&s;s to engage &s;o formidable a Fleet. However it was at the &s;ame time confirm'd, that the whole Coa&s;t of <HI>Provence</HI> was in a great Con&s;ternation, and that the Inhabitants of the Sea-Towns carry'd away the be&s;t of their Goods up higher in|to the Country, for fear of being Bomb'd in their Hou&s;es. The Court of <HI>France</HI> al&s;o was not a little mi&s;tru&s;tful of their
<PB N="9" REF="7">own Sea-men; and therefore fearing lea&s;t the Officers and Sea-men belonging to the Galleys &s;hould play their Officers a &s;curvy Trick upon the appearing of the Confederate Fleet upon the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Provence,</HI> remitted to <HI>Mar&s;ailles</HI> an Hundred Thou&s;and Livres, for the payment of part of their Wages, thereby to engage them to &s;tand firm in their Duty.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide, there was great Joy in the Court of <HI>Madrid,</HI> to hear of the Arrival of the Confederate Fleet upon the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Spain.</HI> The King particularly, as a de|mon&s;tration of his great &s;atisfaction, &s;ent a Pre&s;ent of a Jewel to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Admiral, valued at Five and Twenty Thou&s;and Crowns, and another to Vice Admiral <HI>Calenberg,</HI> valued at Twelve Thou&s;and.</P>
<P>When the Confederate Fleet arriv'd in the Bay of <HI>Bar|cellona,</HI> the Duke of <HI>E&s;calona,</HI> Viceroy of <HI>Catalogna,</HI> went on Board the <HI>Britannia,</HI> to Compliment the Admiral, and during their Interview, all the Canon of the Fleet, and the City, were di&s;charg'd Three times. The next day Admiral <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> went A&s;hore to repay the Viceroy his Vi&s;it; who received him with all the Honour and Re&s;pect that was due to his Per&s;on. After a Conference of a little more than an Hour, there was held a Council of War; at the Conclu&s;ion of which, the Admiral return'd to his Ship. The Viceroy al&s;o &s;ent him as a Pre&s;ent, a Hundred and Fifty Sheep, Four Calves, Six Hundred Candles of Virgins Wax, Six Hundred Tallow Candles, Six Hundred Pound of Choco|late, One Thou&s;and Six Hundred Pound of Sugar, a great number of Capons, Pullets and Turkies, a great quantity of Pul&s;e, and all &s;orts of Fruits, a Hundred Barrels of Excellent Wine, and proportionably of other Liquors, with a proportionable quantity of Snow to cool his Wine. The Magi&s;tracy al&s;o of <HI>Barcellona</HI> made him a Pre&s;ent of Two <HI>Barbary</HI> Hor&s;es richly harne&s;&s;ed, to the value of Three Hundred Pi&s;toles.</P>
<P>And now to return to the Cour&s;e of the Confederate Fleet, Admiral <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> having &s;tay'd before <HI>Barcellona</HI> from the 8th to the 26th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> &s;et &s;ail from thence the
<PB N="10" REF="8">&s;ame Day, no body knowing what Cour&s;e he intended to &s;teer; only that he proceeded as &s;ar as <HI>Blanes,</HI> Four Leagues beyond <HI>Barcellona,</HI> as the Letters from <HI>Toulon</HI> &s;ignified. For Moun&s;ieur <HI>Tourville</HI> no &s;ooner heard of Admiral <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI>'s leaving <HI>Barcellona,</HI> but he &s;ent out &s;everal light Frigates to get intelligence of his Motions; but whether it were that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Admiral was well inform'd that the <HI>French</HI> Fleet was too &s;trongly Barricado'd up in the Port of <HI>Toulon,</HI> to be attack'd without time and lei&s;ure, or that perhaps he had not then received his Orders to winter in the <HI>Me|diterranean;</HI> and therefore finding the Sea&s;on far &s;pent, thought it high time to return back into the Ocean, he &s;teer'd back again for the <HI>Streights,</HI> and upon the 5th of <HI>September,</HI> pa&s;s'd by <HI>Alicant,</HI> with a fair Wind; and the next Day in the Afternoon, the whole Fleet pa&s;s'd by <HI>Car|tagena,</HI> with the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Men of War, the Gallies only being order'd back to <HI>Cartagena;</HI> and upon the 15th he came before <HI>Malaga.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time, the <HI>French</HI> Admiral meditated Two De&s;igns, either to &s;lip by the Confederate Fleet, and get before Admiral <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> with the Squadrons of <HI>Bre&s;t,</HI> into the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean, while the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> were bu&s;ied in the more di&s;tant part of <HI>Provence;</HI> for there was a Rumour &s;pread abroad, of an intended Bombing of <HI>Nice,</HI> or el&s;e to watch the return of the Fleet to the <HI>Streights,</HI> and &s;ail away a &s;econd time for <HI>Barcellona,</HI> where <HI>Nouailles</HI> lay ready, together with &s;uch new Succours as he &s;hould bring him, to fini&s;h the Conque&s;t of <HI>Catalogna.</HI> The fir&s;t he had received Orders at one time to attempt, when Ad|miral <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> cover'd <HI>Barcellona;</HI> but upon better Con&s;ide|rations, the Court of <HI>France</HI> not finding it fea&s;ible to get by a watchful Enemy without being encounter'd, di&s;charg'd him of tho&s;e Cares.</P>
<P>As to the &s;econd, &s;o &s;oon as Admiral <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI>'s Back was turn'd, and while there was yet no certainty of Admiral <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI>'s wintring in the <HI>Mediterranean, Nouailles</HI> and <HI>Tourville</HI> were in great hopes, that they together, might carry <HI>Bar|celona</HI> before the end of the Campaign; and the Court of
<PB N="11" REF="8"><HI>France</HI> flatter'd her &s;elf with the &s;ame Expectations. <HI>Tour|ville</HI> therefore having &s;ent before Seven or Eight Men of War, and &s;ome Fite&s;hips, under the Command of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Beaujeu,</HI> on which were embark'd &s;everal Regiments, &s;et &s;ail with the re&s;t of the Fleet for the Coa&s;t of <HI>Catalogna.</HI> The News of this &s;ayling of the <HI>French</HI> Fleet, carrying with it &s;ome Thou&s;ands of Land Souldiers for the Rein|forcement of <HI>Nouailles,</HI> and the Marching thither at the &s;ame time of a con&s;iderable Body of <HI>French</HI> Hor&s;e by Land, made all People believe that &s;ome great Enterprize was to be undertaken on that &s;ide, and that the Siege of <HI>Barcelona</HI> was re&s;olv'd upon. About the &s;ame time al&s;o, Three <HI>French</HI> Men of War, of Sixty and Seventy Guns, appeared off of <HI>Alicant,</HI> attended by a Fire&s;hip, which gave a &s;u&s;picion of a greater Number. All the&s;e things put together, brought Admiral <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> again into <HI>Alicant</HI> Road, where he ca&s;t Anchor upon the 20th of <HI>September,</HI> New Stile: Of which when the <HI>French</HI> were inform'd, and moreover that it was re&s;olv'd that the Confederate Fleet &s;hould winter in the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> new Orders were di&s;|patch'd away from Court to the Mar&s;hal, which he re|ceived ju&s;t as he was beginning to land his Men at <HI>Pala|mos</HI> and <HI>Blanes;</HI> &s;o that he was forced to return again with all the &s;peed he could to <HI>Toulon,</HI> where he arrived the 23d of <HI>September,</HI> having &s;cap'd Two very terrible Storms, one at his &s;etting out, which brought him again into Har|bour to repair the Ma&s;ts and Rigging of &s;everal Men of War; the &s;econd at his Return, which &s;catter'd his Ships, though they all rejoyn'd at length, except one large Man of War, which had &s;everal Companies of Souldiers A|board, and a Fly-boat laden with Bombs and Mortars. Af|ter which di&s;appointment and ill &s;ucce&s;s, they fell to un|rigging their Ships, the whole Fleet being order'd to be laid up.</P>
<P>While Admiral <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> lay in the Road of <HI>Alicant,</HI> he was taken ill of a Fever; but after he had been &s;ome days a&s;hore in that City, was perfectly re&s;tor'd to his Health, and return'd Aboard the Fleet, a con&s;iderable Squadron

<P>Much about the &s;ame time, Six <HI>Dutch</HI> Privateers as they were Crui&s;ing not far from the I&s;land of <HI>Maltha,</HI> came up with Two <HI>French</HI> Men of War, the one of Sixty, the o|ther of Forty Four Guns, having Four Merchants Ships richly laden from <HI>Smyrna</HI> under their Convoy; upon which the Privateers attack'd the Two Men of War, and &s;o rudely handl'd the bigge&s;t, that &s;he was forced to bear a|way for <HI>Maltha</HI> to &s;ave her &s;elf; but the Privateers took the other, together with the Four Merchant Men.

And while one of the Privateers guarded the Prize to <HI>Palermo,</HI> the other Two met Three <HI>French</HI> Men of War, of Sixty and Forty Guns, which they fought &s;everal Hours, till Night parted them.</P>
<P>This quick Return of Mar&s;hal <HI>Tourville</HI> to <HI>Toulon,</HI> upon Admiral <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI>'s &s;ayling back to <HI>Alicant,</HI> was in &s;ome mea&s;ure ridicul'd by the <HI>French</HI> them&s;elves, as appear'd by a Letter written from <HI>Paris,</HI> upon occa&s;ion of <HI>Tourville</HI>'s Retreat, to this effect.</P>

The Departure of the whole Fleet, and the Expence of &s;etting it out, with Bomb Galliots and Mortars, &s;hew'd that there was &s;omething el&s;e intend|ed, than a bare Landing of Men; nor did they &s;end their Hor&s;e by Land, to go up the Hill, and &s;o come down again.

<P>When it was that Admiral <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> receiv'd his Orders from <HI>England</HI> to Winter in the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> is not ma|terial.

<PB N="14" REF="10">appear'd in the &s;ight of that Port the &s;ame Day; and that at the &s;ame time al&s;o an Hundred Sail of Ships from <HI>England,</HI> with Provi&s;ions and other Nece&s;&s;aries for the Fleet, under the Convoy of &s;everal Men of War, arriv'd in that Port.</P>
<P>In the mean time, it was confirm'd on all Hands by fre&s;h Intelligence, that the <HI>French</HI> were unrigging all their Men of War at <HI>Toulon,</HI> except Six, who were to Crui&s;e during the Winter; and that the Sea-men of the We&s;tern Provinces, were to return back by Land to <HI>Bre&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding tho&s;e Confirmations, Admiral <HI>Ru&s;&s;d</HI> careful to avoid all Surpri&s;es of the <HI>French,</HI> under the pre|tence of unrigging their Ships, though he appear'd before <HI>Cadiz</HI> upon the 12th of <HI>October,</HI> yet kept off at Sea for &s;everal Days; nor was it till the 17th, that he came to Anchor in the Bay of the &s;ame Place, after he had le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">t &s;e|veral Men of War to crui&s;e in the Streights. All this while, notwith&s;tanding the Rumours &s;pread abroad by the <HI>French,</HI> to le&s;&s;en the Fears of the People, that there was a great Mortality, and want of Provi&s;ions in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet, and that they had lo&s;t one third part of their Men, the whole Fleet continued Healthy, and in a good Condition, as being all along carefully pro|vided with all things nece&s;&s;ary, both as to the Men and Ships.</P>
<P>At length however, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Admiral who lay ready to &s;ail, in order to crui&s;e about the <HI>Streights</HI> Mouth, be|ing a&s;&s;ur'd that the <HI>French</HI> were in earne&s;t as to the un|rigging their Ships, and that there was no fear of their ma|king any farther Attempts that Sea&s;on, he took up his &s;tation in the Bay of <HI>Cadiz,</HI> about the beginning of <HI>No|vember;</HI> where he fir&s;t gave order for the Cleaning and Careening of the &s;maller Ships with all the &s;peed that po&s;|&s;ibly could be, in order to their Crui&s;ing, intending after|words to do the like by the Great ones.

<P>In this &s;ame Po&s;ture of Affairs, the main Bu&s;ine&s;s now was to keep &s;ome Men of War always in a readine&s;s to prevent all &s;ini&s;ter Events, and to &s;end forth other Fri|gates upon the &s;cout, to di&s;cover what Ships the Enemy had Abroad, and for the pre&s;ervation of the Merchants Trade.

We admir'd the Prudence and Conduct of your Captain, in the Proofs which he gave of his good With, and in his whole manner of Act|ing; but we were not in a capacity to &s;hew him that kindne&s;s which he merited.

<P>Nor were the Calm Words of this Letter, the &s;ole effect which the wintring of Admiral <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> wrought upon the Pyrates of <HI>Barbary;</HI> for upon the 5th of <HI>September</HI> la&s;t, Mr. <HI>Baker</HI> then Con&s;ul for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation at <HI>Argier,</HI> went from thence in an <HI>Algerine</HI> Man of War for <HI>Tunis,</HI> and being conducted to the Camp of <HI>Shahan Dey,</HI> who then lay before that City, deliver'd to him the Letter from His Maje&s;ty of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> Upon which, the <HI>Dey</HI> calling together all the <HI>Tripoline</HI> Officers that were in the Camp, recommended to them the renewing the Peace which they had with the King of <HI>England;</HI> and having written to the &s;ame Effect, to the <HI>Dey</HI> of <HI>Tripoli,</HI> order'd a Man of War to carry Mr. <HI>Baker</HI> thither, where he was not only welcom'd with a Reception, but ea&s;ily obtain'd his De&s;ires, which ended in a Confirmation of Peace with the Governour of that Place, much to the Advantage of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, and as much to the Di&s;appointment of the <HI>French,</HI> who endeavour'd all they could to prevent it.

<P>The 31th of <HI>December</HI> arriv'd at <HI>Cadiz,</HI> under the Con|voy of the <HI>Rupert,</HI> and &s;everal other Men of War, the Store-Ships and Victuallers that &s;et Sail from the <HI>Spit-Head,</HI> the 5th of the &s;ame Month.</P>

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>AN ABSTRACT OF A LETTER FROM THE <HI>Count de Chalard,</HI> TO THE French Court.</HEAD>
<P>UPon the 28th of <HI>January, (&s;ays he,)</HI> early in the Morning, we di&s;covered Six Sail, which we judged to be <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>By Two a Clock in the Afternoon, we were joyn'd by a Ve&s;&s;el, which as we judg'd, carried about Six Guns, which came up within Pistol Shot before &s;he fir'd a Gun. The <HI>Trident</HI> and I fought her for &s;ome time, but &s;he being &s;oon after join'd by &s;ome others that were the mo&s;t nimble Saylers of her Squadron, the <HI>Trident</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="15">divided her Fire, while I ply'd the fir&s;t Ve&s;&s;el altoge ther till Night came on; at what time my Adver&s;ary having lo&s;t one of her Ma&s;ts, kept off; but then I was attack'd by another Ve&s;&s;el, which left the <HI>Trident,</HI> to fall upon me.</P>
<P>All this while the <HI>Trident</HI> fought with great Violence, &s;uffering &s;everal Di&s;charges from tho&s;e that came toward the <HI>Content;</HI> but &s;he lo&s;t one of her Ma&s;ts a little be|fore Night came on: After which I &s;aw no more of her. In the Condition that I was, I &s;ail'd toward the I&s;le of <HI>Maretimo,</HI> being continually chas'd by Three Ships, of which one was as big as the <HI>Content,</HI> which joyn'd me about Seven at Night, and fought me about Two Hours, and very much di&s;abl'd me. However I continued my cour&s;e as well as I could.</P>
<P>The next Day in the Morning, I was rejoyn'd by the Ship that fought me the Evening before, which was follow'd by Two more; &s;o that by Ten a Clock in the Morning I lo&s;t my Main Ma&s;t.</P>
<P>The Enemy pur&s;u'd their Advantage, and in the Af|ternoon cut down my Mizon, and all the re&s;t of my Ma&s;ts; &s;o that the great Ship play'd upon me as &s;he pleas'd her &s;elf; for we had neither Helm nor Sails left to govern our Ship. For which rea&s;on, finding my &s;elf in this piti|ful condition, I call'd the Officers together to have their Advice, who all te&s;tified their willingne&s;s to &s;acrifice their Lives for the King's Service; but con&s;idering the Condition of the Ship, and the Superior Number of the Enemy, it was re&s;olv'd that we &s;hould yield, which was done the 29th, at Four in the Afternoon.</P>
<P>The Officers and the Marine Guards, behav'd them|&s;elves with extraordinary Courage and Bravery.</P>
<PB N="26" REF="16">
<P>After we had yielded, we were put Aboard the <HI>Carli&s;le;</HI> by the Captain of which Ve&s;&s;el we were ex|treamly well u&s;ed; nor did they take away our Swords, which was done out of a particular e&s;teem which they had for my Per&s;on.</P>
<P>We were carried to <HI>Me&s;&s;ina,</HI> where we met the other <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men of War, and the Officers of the <HI>Trident,</HI> which far'd no better than we did, though the Officers and Souldiers behav'd them&s;elves with all the Bravery imaginable. And the next day that we arrived in the Port, the Governour of <HI>Me&s;&s;ina</HI> &s;ent us a Civil Com|pliment, offering to &s;erve us to the utmo&s;t of his Power, and order'd us to want for nothing. <HI>This Letter was &s;ub&s;crib'd</HI></P>

<P>Upon the 8th of <HI>March,</HI> Five <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and Four <HI>Dutch</HI> Men of War, &s;ail'd away from <HI>Cadiz,</HI> to meet the Home|ward bound <HI>Turky</HI> Ships, and the <HI>Mary, Canterbury, Dra|gon,</HI> and <HI>Mury Galley</HI> returned from Crui&s;ing. And much about the &s;ame time Rear Admiral <HI>Nevil</HI> was going out with another Squadron of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Men of War.</P>
<P>Toward the beginning of <HI>April,</HI> the <HI>Port&s;mouth, Grey|hound</HI> and <HI>Lark</HI> returned from Crui&s;ing, having been as far as <HI>Toulon,</HI> where they took a fi&s;her Boat with Six Men, who confirm'd what had been reported before, that the <HI>French</HI> had no de&s;ign to fit out their Fleet at <HI>Toulon,</HI> but that they were Forti&s;ying the Town and the Haven, to &s;ecure it again&s;t the A&s;&s;aults of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch:</HI> More-e&s;pecially, that they were at work to Clean&s;e and Fortify a &s;mall Port in <HI>Provence,</HI> wherein to lay up their Galleys, as believing they will be more &s;afe there, than at <HI>Mar|&s;eilles.</HI></P>

<P>Upon the 18th of <HI>April,</HI> Six <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Frigates return'd to <HI>Cadiz,</HI> that &s;et &s;ail from thence &s;ome time before, having left in the Port of <HI>Me&s;&s;ina,</HI> the Two <HI>French</HI> Ships of Seventy and Sixty Five Guns, which they took in the Channel of <HI>Malta.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the 20th of the &s;ame Month, Admiral <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> or|der'd the whole Fleet to fire their Guns at a Minutes Di|&s;tance between the Firing of every Gun, as being a Solem|nity due upon the fir&s;t notice of the Queen's Funeral.</P>
<P>Upon the 22d of <HI>April,</HI> a numerous Fleet of Store-Ships, Victuallers, Bomb-ketches, Tran&s;port-Ships, and Merchant-Men, making in all Sixty Sail, arriv'd at <HI>Cadiz</HI> from <HI>England,</HI> under a Convoy of &s;everal Men of War, com|manded by Captain <HI>Warren;</HI> and then it was &s;aid, that Ad|miral <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> would &s;peedily put to Sea with the whole Fleet. 'Tis al&s;o &s;aid, that there is an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;ul arriv'd at <HI>Rome,</HI> to a&s;&s;ure that Court, that if the Confederate Fleet came into tho&s;e Seas, it would not be to do the lea&s;t Da|mage to the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical State; and that he al&s;o at the &s;ame time demanded that the &s;aid Fleet might have leave to buy Fre&s;h Provi&s;ions at <HI>Civita Vecchia,</HI> in ca&s;e they &s;hould &s;tand in need of them.</P>
<P>After this, the Letters of the 4th In&s;tant, gave an Ac|count, that the Fleet had lain &s;everal Days with their Top &s;ails loo&s;e, &s;o that 'twas generally believ'd they were put to Sea e're this.</P>
<P>Other Letters al&s;o from <HI>Coronna,</HI> gave an Account, that Two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Frigates had lately taken a <HI>French</HI> Privateer of Twenty Four Guns off of the Southern Cape; moreover that the <HI>Delaval</HI> had taken a Brigantine of Six Guns, and Seventy Men: And farther, that Captain <HI>Goade</HI> in the <HI>Boyn,</HI> has brought to <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> a Great <HI>French</HI> Ship richly laden, that pretended to be a <HI>Venetian.</HI></P>
<PB N="28" REF="17">
<P>Thus we have accompanied this Magnificent and For|midable Fleet in all the la&s;t Summers Expedition, to the great di&s;appointment of <HI>France,</HI> brought it into Har|bour during the Winter, and &s;een it ready to put to Sea again. So that if the <HI>French</HI> have not made <HI>Toulon</HI> and <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> Inacce&s;&s;ible to Fire and Flames, and Impenetrable to the Batteries of Marine Thunder, it may be expected, and, we doubt not, but to give a more plea&s;ing Relation of the Actions of this Summer, and fuller of Variety in the next Account.</P>
