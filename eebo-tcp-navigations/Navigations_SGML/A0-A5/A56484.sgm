<HEAD>A Particular ACCOUNT Of the Suddain and Unexpected <HI>Siege of Vienna,</HI> The Capital City of AUSTRIA, And Re&s;idence of the Emperour of GERMANY, At pre&s;ent Be&s;ieged by the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Army, Con|&s;i&s;ting of a Hundred and Fifty Thou&s;and Men, (the 8th. of <HI>July,</HI> 1683.) under the Command of the <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier,</HI> and what pa&s;&s;ed during the Seige, as well within the City, as without it.</HEAD>
<P>THis famous City took its Name from the River <HI>Wien,</HI> which flows into the <HI>Danube,</HI> and is the Re&s;idence of the Emperour, and Metropolis of <HI>Au|&s;tria,</HI> a Royal Fortification, Surrounded with thick Walls, Ba&s;tions, deep Ditches, and lofty Towers, in &s;uch &s;ort as She may well be Stiled the <HI>Bulwark</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Turks,</HI> the Key of <HI>Germany,</HI> and of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> World, as She made it appear in the Year 1529. When <HI>Solyman</HI> the <HI>Magnificent,</HI> Emperour of the <HI>Turks,</HI> Sate down before it, with Three Hundred Thou&s;and Men, and after Six Months Furious and unu&s;ual Attacques, was forced to withdraw, whereupon that <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> City was delivered.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Emperour, in this pre&s;ent Year, 1683, Like a Tyrant thir&s;ting after <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Bloud (by the Encouragement of the Rebel <HI>Count Teckley</HI>) &s;ent a|gain into <HI>Hungary,</HI> Two Hundred Thou&s;and Men, under the Conduct of the <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier</HI> to Commence a War with the <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> which is now carried on with great Fury: The <HI>Turks</HI> have lately made an Incur&s;ion near <HI>Raab,</HI> in which the Regiment of Dragoons Commanded by the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> were Routed, the Duke him&s;elf, and the Prince of <HI>Arembergh</HI> Wounded, &s;o that they Died; Whereupon the <HI>Imperi|al</HI> Infantry retreated to the I&s;le of <HI>Schut,</HI> and the <HI>Cavelry</HI> to <HI>Vienna,</HI> near the <HI>Da|nube.</HI> After which the <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier</HI> pa&s;&s;ed the Cities of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="3 letters">orra</HI> and <HI>Raab,</HI> and (the 8th. of <HI>July</HI>) Be&s;eiged the City of <HI>Vienna,</HI> with a Hundered and Fifty Thou|&s;and Men; and ordered the Re&s;t of the Forces, to lay wa&s;te the Country in their March, &s;o as utterly to extirpate <HI>Chri&s;tianity.</HI> The <HI>Be&s;iegers</HI> immediately rai&s;ed Three &s;everal Batteries before <HI>Vienna,</HI> and Fired thence into the Town, Day and Night, with great Fury, but the brave Governour, Count <HI>Starembergh</HI> made a Vi|gorous
<PB REF="2">Defence, levelled the Batteries, and in many A&s;&s;aults happily repul&s;ed the E|nemy, &s;o as there were Slain of the <HI>Turks</HI> in the&s;e Attacques above Twenty Thou|&s;and, and of the <HI>Be&s;eiged</HI> about Twenty Per&s;ons killed, and &s;ome Wounded: The <HI>Turks</HI> &s;ent &s;everal times their Propo&s;als for a &s;hort Re&s;pite to Bury their Dead, which was refu&s;ed them, &s;o as in the End, the Annoyance from dead Bodies, and tho&s;e they found in the Mines, that Died of the Pe&s;tilence, Obliged them to draw &s;ome di&s;tance off from the City. In the mean time, the Be&s;eiged were refre&s;hed, and Vow|ed to Defend it to the la&s;t drop of Bloud. All Things in the City Remained in a good Po&s;ture, and at length they &s;eize'd two Incendiaries, who had privately conveyed Matches of Gunpowder with Artificial Fires into many Hou&s;es with de&s;ign to Burn them, and to Fire the <HI>Scotch Monastery</HI> and <HI>Church;</HI> but their De&s;ignes were timely Dicovered, and the Contrivers were fir&s;t Torterd, then ca&s;t alive into the Fire.</P>
<P>The Be&s;eiged did then believe the Enemy had for&s;ook the City, but they returned and rai&s;ed new Batteries, on which they mounted Six large peices of Ordinance and many new Mortar&mdash;peices, which they Di&s;charged with greater Vigour than before. They gave out, that the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> wou'd come in per&s;on before his Army, and bring extraordinary Supplies with him. Notwith&s;tanding, the Be&s;ieged &s;upported them&s;elves with great Re&s;olution, for there came over not long before an Engineer who brought with him a Draught of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Camp to the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and a&s;&s;ured him, that the <HI>Turk</HI> wanted Provi&s;ions; and there|fore that if the Three Mines they had &s;prung were ineffectual, they mu&s;t &s;peedilly rai&s;e the Siege: The Enemy blew up two of them, which were between the <HI>Ca&s;tle</HI> and <HI>Karndter Gate;</HI> One of which was countermined, and in it many of the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;lain: but the Second, weakened the <HI>Counters Carp,</HI> and the <HI>Turks</HI> lodged them|&s;elves in the <HI>Ditch,</HI> but by a brisk Sally, they were beaten off again,</P>
<P>The 29th. of the la&s;t <HI>Month,</HI> were &s;lan in a general A&s;&s;ault more than Ten Thou&s;and <HI>Turks.</HI> In &s;hort, the City of <HI>Vienna</HI> wou'd endure, with the help of God, four or five Months longer, being &s;o well &s;tored with Provi&s;ions that Governour <HI>Starembergh</HI> &s;ent as much Bread for two Pence to the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Camp as wou'd co&s;t with them &s;ix Crownes: Wee hope by the Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance, that the Cheif <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> City will be pre&s;erved from the Cruelty of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Emperour, and that he may langui&s;h in his De&s;ires and return to <HI>Mahomets</HI> Stables, and that the great God will dwell in the Garri&s;on of <HI>Vienna,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of twenty Thou&s;and Men Effective, be&s;ides the Scholars and Young Men, the Auxiliary Forces of <HI>Poland</HI> and tho&s;e of the Empire.</P>
