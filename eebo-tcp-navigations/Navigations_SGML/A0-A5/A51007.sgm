<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE only Con&s;iderati|on that engag'd me to Publi&s;h this Work, was my De&s;ire to plea&s;e You, and to &s;ecure that Intere&s;t in Your Goodne&s;s, with which You are pleas'd to Honour me. I con|fe&s;s my Re&s;olution was a little &s;hock'd, when I reflected on the Dangers and Di&s;courage|ments to which an Author ex|po&s;es him&s;elf, by appearing in &s;o Nice and Knowing an Age: But my Reluctancy was quick|ly
<PB REF="4">
overcome by the &s;en&s;e I had of my Obligation to give You this Mark of my Acknow|ledgment and Re&s;pect.</P>
<P>When <HI>His Grace</HI> the DUKE of <HI>ORMOND, Your Grandfa|ther,</HI> did me the Honour to commit the Care of Your E|ducation to me, I labour'd with all the Application I was capable of, to di&s;charge that great Tru&s;t with &s;uitable Di|ligence and Fidelity: And, to &s;peak only of Your <HI>Travels,</HI> I may &s;ay without Vanity, that I was very careful to make You receive all that Plea&s;ure and Advantage You might de&s;ire or expect from 'em. My pre&s;ent Attempt is but a Continuation of my for|mer Care: My chief De&s;ign in the Publication of the&s;e
<PB REF="4">
Letters being to refre&s;h and pre&s;erve the <HI>Idea's</HI> of what You then ob&s;erv'd, and to make that Satisfaction la&s;ting, which, perhaps, Time would have in&s;en&s;ibly de&s;troy'd.</P>
<P>I hope, SIR, You will re|ceive favourably this Effect of my Zeal and Affection to Your Service. If You were as <HI>&s;evere</HI> a <HI>Critick,</HI> as You are an <HI>exact Judge,</HI> I might ju&s;t|ly de&s;pair of plea&s;ing You: But all my Fears vani&s;h when I reflect on that peculiar Sweet|ne&s;s of Temper, and that Na|tural Inclination You have to con&s;ider Things on the mo&s;t Advantageous &s;ide. This Thought in&s;pires me with &s;o much Confidence, that no|thing le&s;s than Your <HI>Mode&s;ty,</HI> could over-awe me, and re|&s;train
<PB REF="5">
the Impetuo&s;ity of my De&s;ires. I would give You all the Prai&s;es You de|&s;erve, and think my &s;elf ob|lig'd to take this Occa&s;ion to proclaim the Genero&s;ity, Pro|bity, Courage, Moderation, and all the other Vertues which I have &s;o often admir'd in You, if I were not &s;en&s;ible that I could not do You Ju&s;tice without offending You.</P>
<P>And therefore all that I &s;hall &s;ay on &s;o alluring a Sub|ject is, That tho&s;e admirable Perfections are a part of Your Heritage, as being in&s;eparably united to the Illu&s;trious Blood that fills Your Veins. True Nobility, and Greatne&s;s of Mind have been always entail'd on Your Family. The Repu|tation of His Grace the late

DUKE of <HI>ORMOND</HI> is &s;pread over all <HI>Europe,</HI> in the mo&s;t Glorious manner imagi|nable. And the EARL of <HI>OSSORY,</HI> Your Father, ap|ply'd him&s;elf with equal Care and Succe&s;s to the Imitation of &s;o Noble a Pattern: That Great Captain was at once the Terror of His Prince's Enemies, the Joy and Love of the People, the Delight of the Court, and Admiration of Strangers. The Honour which I had in Your Company, to approach &s;everal <HI>Sovereign Princes,</HI> gave me the Oppor|tunity to learn from their own Mouths, how highly they e|&s;teem'd him, and with how &s;en&s;ible an Affliction they re|ceiv'd the News of the un|timely Period of &s;o bright a Life. <HI>His Grace</HI> the DUKE

<HEAD>THE AUTHOR's PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I undertook the Voyage de&s;crib'd in the following Letters, I re&s;olv'd to keep an exact Journal of the mo&s;t remarkable Things that &s;hould fall under my Ob&s;ervation; and &s;ome of my Friends having engag'd me to communicate my Remarks to 'em, from time to time, my intended Jour|nal was in&s;en&s;ibly chang'd to Let|ters.</P>
<P>I will not trouble the Reader with an Account of the Rea&s;ons that oblige me to &s;uffer this little Work to appear in Publick: But, perhaps, it will not be improper to inform him,
<PB REF="7">
why I thought fit to &s;end it abroad in its Native Dre&s;s. The Style of the Letters is Conci&s;e, Free, and Familiar, and in all re&s;pects mo&s;t &s;uitable to my De&s;ign. When an Author under|takes to give a particular De&s;cription of the Subject on which he writes, he is oblig'd to acquaint his Reader with all its Circum&s;tances, and to omit no|thing that relates to it. But there is a very wide difference between an ex|act De&s;cription of a Country, and a brief Account of it in a Letter.</P>
<P>So that if it be Objected, that I have forgot to mention &s;everal things that de&s;erv'd to be taken notice of, I &s;hall content my &s;elf with making this &s;hort Reply, that, He who Pro|mi&s;es nothing, cannot be ju&s;tly accus'd of Forgetting any thing. The&s;e are familiar Letters, in which I do not in the lea&s;t oblige my &s;elf to in|&s;ert all that might be &s;aid of the Pla|ces mention'd in 'em: Only I relate
<PB REF="7">
what I have &s;een, or heard, from Per&s;ons of unque&s;tion'd Credit; and what, in my Opinion, de&s;erves to be communicated to the Publick.</P>
<P>If it be further pretended, that I treat of &s;ome things which were gene|rally known before; I an&s;wer, That if all tho&s;e who repeat the Ob&s;ervati|ons of others mu&s;t be condemn'd with|out Mercy, by the &s;ame Sentence mo&s;t Books that are extant, mu&s;t be doom'd to the Fire: For the new Di&s;coveries of a whole Age would &s;carce fill a &s;mall Volume. Every Man has a dif|ferent way of expre&s;&s;ing his Thoughts, and of repre&s;enting the Subjects of which he treats; which makes 'em in a manner different from them&s;elves, when de&s;crib'd by another, and gives a right to each particular Per&s;on to make new Reflections on 'em. But not to in&s;i&s;t on that Plea; The Rea|der of the&s;e Letters will find an Ac|count of tho&s;e Things that happen'd
<PB REF="8">
in my Time, and of &s;ome late Alte|rations, which I cannot be &s;uppos'd to have borrow'd from tho&s;e who wrote before me: And, in the general, I &s;ee no rea&s;on why the Book, which I now offer to the Publick, may not ju&s;t|ly claim the Title of a <HI>New Work,</HI> and I'm confident, it will be acknow|ledged as &s;uch, by all unprejudic'd Per&s;ons, who &s;hall con&s;ider either that I have added &s;everal remarkable Cir|cum&s;tances, or e&s;tabli&s;h'd <HI>Idea's</HI> that I found to be ju&s;ter, and more exact than tho&s;e I had receiv'd from the Re|lations of others; or, to add no other Con&s;iderations, that I have given a new Turn of Expre&s;&s;ion to &s;uch things as were already de&s;crib'd. And tho' I could not wholly omit &s;ome Pa&s;|&s;ages that had been formerly taken no|tice of by other Authors, without &s;poil|ing the Connexion of the Parts of my Work, and depriving the future Traveller of part of the Advantage
<PB REF="8">
which I hope he may receive from my Labours; yet, upon a careful Exami|nation, it will be found that many of my Ob&s;ervations are in all re&s;pects New and Uncommon.</P>
<P>I could not leave the Places thro' which I pa&s;t on the Road, without examining and enquiring into the mo&s;t remarkable Things that were to be found in 'em, and without giving &s;ome account of 'em in my Letters. But &s;ince the main De&s;ign of our Voyage was to &s;ee <HI>Italy;</HI> and &s;ince I have chiefly in&s;i&s;ted on the De&s;cription of that Countrey, I thought fit to give that Title to the whole Work, which a|grees properly to the principal part of it.</P>
<P>Of tho&s;e who travel into <HI>Italy,</HI> &s;ome make it their only bu&s;ine&s;s to enquire after its Antiquities; and o|thers apply them&s;elves wholly to the &s;tudy of Painting and Architecture: There are &s;ome who mind nothing but
<PB REF="9">
Libraries, and Cabinets of Curio&s;ities; and others &s;pend their time in vi&s;iting Churches and Relicks. But my Cu|rio&s;ity was more Univer&s;al, and would not &s;uffer me to confine my Enquiries to one Subject; which gives my Let|ters the advantage of Variety, and at lea&s;t in this re&s;pect, I hope they will not &s;eem unplea&s;ant to the generality of Readers.</P>
<P>When I found my &s;elf under an almo&s;t indi&s;pen&s;able nece&s;&s;ity to con&s;ent to the Publication of this Work, I thought my &s;elf oblig'd to make it u&s;eful to tho&s;e who &s;hall afterwards undertake the &s;ame Voyage: And therefore I have in&s;erted &s;everal Pa&s;|&s;ages in tho&s;e Letters, which I did not think fit to mention, when they were only directed to two or three Friends: And, in pur&s;uance of the &s;ame De&s;ign, I have &s;ubjoin'd an <HI>Appendix</HI> at the end of the Book, containing Ad|vice or In&s;tructions to a Traveller.</P>
<P><PB REF="9">To &s;atisfie the importunate de&s;ires of tho&s;e with whom I entertain'd a Corre&s;pondence during my Travels, I was forc'd to give 'em an account of every thing I ob&s;erv'd, without omit|ting even the &s;malle&s;t and lea&s;t con&s;i|derable Remarks. But &s;ince the Cu|rio&s;ity of mo&s;t Readers extends not &s;o far, I was &s;oon per&s;uaded to obey tho&s;e who advis'd me to cut off &s;eve|ral Pa&s;&s;ages in my Letters, which perhaps would have been e&s;teem'd Imper|tinent or Trifling. For tho&s;e who have the Happine&s;s to be Ma&s;ters of an Uni|ver&s;al Wit, and of an equally &s;olid and nice Judgment, are capable of making Advantage of every thing, and are u&s;ually &s;ooner pleas'd than tho&s;e who are le&s;s beholding to Nature for the liberal Di&s;tribution of her Fa|vours. If it be &s;till urg'd, that I have left &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages which might have been cut off with the re&s;t, I mu&s;t beg leave to tell tho&s;e pretended
<PB REF="10">
Criticks, that They are very much mi|&s;taken if they imagine that nothing ought to be admitted into Works of this Nature, but what is great and important. The&s;e are neither Ser|mons, nor Negotiations of Amba&s;&s;a|dors; and that which might be ju&s;tly call'd a Trifle in a Di&s;cour&s;e upon a lofty Subject, de&s;erves another Title in &s;uch a Relation as this, and e&s;pe|cially in a Letter. Be&s;ides, there are &s;ome mean and &s;eemingly trifling Things, which, for all their meanne&s;s, are yet very plea&s;ant and diverting. The Publick has receiv'd &s;ome Rela|tions very favourably, which take no|tice of the &s;malle&s;t Circum&s;tances, not forgetting even the Signs of Taverns; neither indeed is it ju&s;t to oblige a Traveller to relate nothing but Pro|digies. 'Tis true, he ought not to fill his Journal with in&s;ipid Ob&s;ervations; but there is hardly any thing on which an exact and ingenious Per|&s;on
<PB REF="10">
is not capable of making Re|flexions.</P>
<P>I have ob&s;erv'd, that tho&s;e who &s;peak of <HI>Italy</HI> are u&s;ually full of Prejudices, which are extremely to the Advantage of that Country. Mo&s;t Young Travellers being per&s;uaded that they &s;hall find there an infinite Num|ber of &s;urprizing Rarities, go thither with a Re&s;olution to admire every thing they &s;ee. And all the Relati|ons we have of it, &s;eem to have been de&s;ign'd for Panegyricks. The Fame of that part of the World has been rais'd &s;o high, and &s;o &s;trongly e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd, that 'tis e&s;teem'd an unpar|donable Crime to le&s;&s;en its Reputation. The Grandeur, for Example, and the almo&s;t infinite Magnificence of the celebrated City of <HI>Rome,</HI> with the ancient Charms of <HI>Bayae</HI> and <HI>Capua,</HI> in&s;pire the generality of Mankind with a Veneration for a few pieces of Marble, which are the only Re|mainders
<PB REF="11">
of their Ruines; tho' 'tis certain that tho&s;e Places, if we con|&s;ider 'em in their pre&s;ent Condition, are not at all preferrable to a va&s;t Number of others, which are not &s;o much as taken notice of in the World. But there is al&s;o another Rea&s;on, which doubtle&s;s contributes very much to confirm Travellers in their Preju|dices; and that is, the u&s;ual manner in which the <HI>Italians</HI> &s;peak of their Country. 'Tis certain, that the Peo|ple of that Nation have &s;o much Fire in their Imagination, and their Phra&s;es are naturally &s;o &s;trong and &s;ignificative, that they are oftentimes apt to &s;peak of Things with too much Force. 'Tis true, they have many &s;oft and plea&s;ant, not to &s;ay Api&s;h and Childi&s;h Expre&s;&s;i|ons; but when they change their Style, they are apt to run to the other ex|treamity, and, on a &s;udden, lo&s;e them&s;elves in wild and unnatural Hy|perboles. This Humour of the <HI>Ita|lians</HI>
<PB REF="11">
by degrees infects &s;ome of tho&s;e Strangers who re&s;ide among 'em, and in conjunction with their former Pre|judices, prompts 'em to make long and lofty Di&s;cour&s;es, on the mo&s;t in|con&s;iderable Subjects. The Ob&s;ervati|on of tho&s;e Mi&s;carriages in others, made me very careful to avoid falling into the &s;ame Errors: I examin'd things coolly, and &s;uffer'd tho&s;e perpetual Admirers to evaporate in &s;ublime Fi|gures, and Exclamations of Wonder, without regarding their pompous and &s;uperlative Expre&s;&s;ions. But tho' I had not the Complai&s;ance to admire every thing which they extoll'd, I hope I &s;hall not have the Misfor|tune to be accus'd of being po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with a Prejudice, oppo&s;ite to that which I blame in others; for the equitable Reader will ea&s;ily perceive, that I take Plea&s;ure to do ju&s;tice to tho&s;e things which I think de|&s;erve Prai&s;e.</P>
<P><PB REF="12">I wrote the&s;e Letters without con&s;ulting the Authors who have treated of the &s;ame Subject before me: For be&s;ides that the hurry of Tra|velling made &s;uch a De&s;ign impra|cticable, I could not have receiv'd much benefit by it, &s;ince, as I in|timated before, I intended only to relate what I &s;aw, or learn'd, with|out engaging in a particular and exact De&s;cription of the Country. I thought fit to make this ingenu|ous Declaration, That if any Pa&s;|&s;ages in this Work be found to be incon&s;i&s;tent with the Relations of others, I may not be accus'd of ta|king Plea&s;ure to contradict 'em; for I only give a &s;incere and na|tural Account of my own Ob&s;er|vations, or of what I heard from Per&s;ons of un&s;u&s;pected Credit, without the lea&s;t De&s;ign to offend any Man what&s;oever.</P>
<P><PB REF="12">I hope every candid Reader will make a Di&s;tinction between tho&s;e things which I affirm po&s;itively, and tho&s;e which are u&s;her'd in with a <HI>'Tis &s;aid;</HI> tho' even in the&s;e Ca&s;es I have related nothing but what is grounded on the general Opinion, and was never contradicted by any with whom I have had occa&s;ion to conver&s;e: For, after all, I would not be oblig'd to warrant the Truth of the&s;e common Reports, which are of|tentimes found to be common Lyes.</P>
<P>To avoid the Confu&s;ion occa&s;ion'd by the various length of Leagues and Miles in <HI>Germany;</HI> I u&s;ually expre&s;s the di&s;tance of Places by the Number of Hours that are com|monly &s;pent in travelling between 'em; and if at any time I make u&s;e of the Word <HI>League,</HI> I under&s;tand an Hour's Journey. The <HI>Italian</HI> Miles are generally known, and need no explication; only the Reader may take
<PB REF="13">
notice, That Two Miles in <HI>Pied|mont</HI> make almo&s;t Three, after the ordinary way of reckoning; and that the Miles of <HI>Lombardy</HI> are the &s;horte&s;t of all. I &s;hall only add, That when I mea&s;ure any Di&s;tance by a certain number of Paces, I mean the Steps I u&s;ually make in Walking,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>HOLLAND</HI> is a Country &s;o near and &s;o well known to yours, that I &s;hould, perhaps, have &s;aid nothing of it, had not your ex|pre&s;s Commands obliged me to it; in com|pliance therefore with your de&s;ires, I will endeavour to give you an Idea of this rare Country, with a particular Account of the Cities I &s;aw there. As to the re&s;t, <HI>Holland</HI> hath &s;o many particulars worth your Ob|&s;ervation and View, that I think it im|po&s;&s;ible you &s;hould decline making a Voyage thither: The Pa&s;&s;age over is but &s;hort, and
<PB N="2" REF="15">
you will have a thou&s;and opportunities to render it convenient. But being per&s;uaded, that you will not fail, one day, to &s;atisfie &s;o rea&s;onable a Curio&s;ity, I &s;hall not enter|tain you &s;o largely as I might, with an ac|count of tho&s;e charming Provinces, wherein I have formerly, for a long time, &s;ojourned.</P>
<P>We ob&s;erved, from our Ve&s;&s;el, as we ap|proach'd the&s;e Coa&s;ts, that the nearer we came, we perceived the tops of the Trees, and the &s;ummits of the Steeples, as if they i&s;&s;ued out of a Land &s;unk under Water. In &s;hort, <HI>Holland</HI> is univer&s;ally flat and low, like one continued Meadow. 'Tis cut in|to Canals, and large Ditches, to receive and drain the Waters, which otherwi&s;e would &s;oak the Lands like drunken To&s;ts; there are but few Places that can be Cultivated. A Country like this is not naturally Habi|table; yet, Indu&s;try, con&s;tant Labour, and the Love of Profit, have brought it into &s;uch a State, that there is not in the World, one &s;o Rich, and &s;o well Peopled, propor|tionably to its extent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Pufendorf.</HI> Others pretend that the Seven Provinces to|gether do not contain more than Two Mil|lions of Inha|bitants.

Thus you &s;ee how commodious their Canals are, but this is not all the convenience they receive, by the drain of their Waters; they are al&s;o u&s;eful for Traffick, and tran&s;port of Goods as well as Men. The Earth which they take out, rai&s;es the Banks, and makes the ways more fit for Foot-Men; they &s;erve both for Enclo&s;ure and Ornament. In &s;ome Places they have plenty of Fi&s;h.</P>
<P>Abundance of things are naturally want|ing in <HI>Holland:</HI> But Foreign Countries plentifully &s;upply them with Corn, as well as Wines and all other Nece&s;&s;aries for Life.

<P>I Had &s;ome regret to write my la&s;t Letter to you from <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">AMSTER|DAM.</NOTE> without giving any account of that famous City, but that I fan&s;ied I &s;hould do well to refre&s;h my Me|mory with its Idea, that I might write things more certainly. In the mean time I intreat you to remember, that I have not promi&s;ed to give you an intire de&s;cription of any place: It would require a long con|tinuance in this City to learn every thing of it, and a great Volume to write it all.</P>
<P><HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> is without doubt one of the mo&s;t beautiful, admirable, and important Cities in the World; and 'tis certain, that it an&s;wers in every point the great Reputa|tion it hath in the World: But that one may be more Surpri&s;ed with its Beauty, it would be be&s;t not to have known before|hand, the other Cities of <HI>Holland.</HI> I con|fe&s;s, that after I had &s;een the Haven of <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> and the Beauties of the <HI>Hague</HI> and <HI>Leyden,</HI> I was but little &s;urpri&s;ed when I came fir&s;t to <HI>Am&s;terdam:</HI> I found nothing there which might much di&s;tingui&s;h it from tho&s;e other Cities.

There are among&s;t them &s;ome of all &s;orts of Qualities, and nothing is required to make them capable of admittance but good Te&s;timonials, and an E&s;tate &s;ufficient to maintain them at their own Charges; every <HI>Beguine</HI> may have her Hou&s;e and ne|ce&s;&s;ary conveniences by her &s;elf, or they may joyn &s;everal together, according as Kindred or Friend&s;hip may incline them. The place of this Society bears the name of the <HI>Beguinage,</HI> which is commonly like a little City inclo&s;ed within another, and hath about it a Wall and a Ditch. There is one Church in this inclo&s;ure, where the <HI>Beguines</HI> are obliged to be pre&s;ent at the hours appointed for their Devotions. Their Habits are black, and &s;omething fanta&s;tical. They regulate their Expences as they plea&s;e

them&s;elves, as well for their Table as Fur|niture. They receive and pay Vi&s;its when they plea&s;e. They quit the <HI>Beguinage</HI> when they are minded to Marry, or on any other occa&s;ion. And it may be &s;aid, that this retreat, far from the vowed con&s;traint of a Convent, is a very &s;weet and rea&s;onable manner of living.</P>
<P>The confu&s;ion cau&s;ed by the Coaches, by rea&s;on of the perpetual Carriage of Mer|chandizes, and the danger of &s;haking the Hou&s;es, which, as I told you, are founded on Piles, is the rea&s;on that none but Strangers and Phy&s;icians are allowed to have any; Sleds indeed are permitted, but that being a &s;low and unea&s;ie Carriage, there are none but old Women who make u&s;e of it.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE were &s;even whole hours on the Canal between <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> and <HI>U|trecht,</HI> but the way was extreamly plea&s;ant, as well becau&s;e of the fair Weather, and the fine Country, as of the good Company we had in the Boat.</P>
<P>We left on the Right-hand, three Leagues from <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> the old Ca&s;tle of <HI>Abcow,</HI> with the Village of the &s;ame name, where are the bounds of the Province of <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>It was late when we came to <HI>Utrecht,</HI> and our Affairs allowed us to &s;tay there but &s;ome part of the next day.

<P>A Gentleman of <HI>Utrecht</HI> imparted a cu|rious Ob&s;ervation to me, by which you may judge of the number of Towns throughout this Country; he found forty eight, to each of which one may go ea&s;ily from <HI>Utrecht</HI> in a day, and there are thirty three of them to which you may go and come back the &s;ame day.</P>
<P>When you go out of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> you find a Country altogether different from that we left la&s;t.

<P>Between <HI>Rhenen</HI> and <HI>Arnheim</HI> the Fields are almo&s;t wholly Planted with Tabaco, and the Stakes by which it is propped, make a &s;hew of Vineyards at a di&s;tance.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THis Letter will give you an Account of part of what I could ob&s;erve at <HI>Cologne</HI> in three days.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>COLOGNE,</HI> an Imperial City and Hans-Town. <HI>Otho</HI> the Great made it an Imperial City, and gave it the Privi|ledges it now enjoys.</NOTE> As we wander'd in our Walks abroad, you mu&s;t expect no regular Order in the little Relations which I &s;end you. I am glad to give you this Adverti&s;ement by the by, that you may not expect to have things in a better Me|thod than we found them.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="31"><HI>Cologne</HI> is to be &s;een far enough off, and all in plain view in a level Country. The City is very great,<NOTE PLACE="marg">There are <HI>24</HI> Gates, <HI>13</HI> to the Land, and <HI>11</HI> on the <HI>Rhine.</HI></NOTE> &s;urrounded with a Wall and dry Ditch, with Towers and Ba&s;tions which defend its Gates. There is rarely &s;o great a number of Steeples to be any where &s;een, as appeared to us on the &s;ide we ap|proached it.</P>
<P><HI>Cologne,</HI> as you know, is an Imperial City, governed by its Burgo-Ma&s;ters: But the Arch-Bi&s;hop hath there a very great Power. This Prince takes cognizance of all Affairs both Civil and Criminal, and can Pardon tho&s;e whom the Magi&s;trates con|demn. And the Oath which the City takes, &s;eems to be a kind of Homage: It is in the&s;e terms; <HI>We Free Burge&s;&s;es of</HI> Cologne, <HI>do this day, for now, and for ever promi&s;e to &mdash; Arch-Bi&s;hop of</HI> Cologne, <HI>to be faithful and favourable to him, as long as he &s;hall con&s;erve in our Rights and Honour, and in our ancient Priviledges, Us, our Wives, our Children, and our City of</HI> Cologne. <HI>So God and his Saints help us.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">There is great Jealou&s;ie be|tween the City and the Elector. They will not &s;uffer him to &s;tay long there with any great Train. Many Arch-Bi&s;hops have attempted their Liberties. &V;nder the Reign of the Emperour <HI>Adol|phus</HI> of <HI>Na&s;&s;aw,</HI> the Inhabitants went in Arms to meet their Arch-Bi|&s;hop, as far as <HI>Woringhen</HI> in <HI>Brabant,</HI> where having put the Keys of their City between him and them in the Field of Battel, to be the price of the Victory, they obtained that with their Keys and Franchi&s;es. They have ever &s;ince celebrated a Fe&s;tival on this Account, with a great deal of Ceremony. <HI>Hei&s;s.</HI></NOTE>If you plea&s;e, you may have the An&s;wer which the Bi&s;hop returns them; it was a Burgo-Ma&s;ter gave me them both.</P>

In Te&s;timony whereof,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Chapter of <HI>Cologne</HI> is compo&s;ed of &s;ixty Canons, who ought all to be Princes or Earls. The four and twenty Elde&s;t are the Capitularies.</P>
<P>It was formerly the Electors of <HI>Cologne,</HI> who Crowned the Emperour according to the Con&s;titution of the <HI>Golden-Bull;</HI> but the&s;e Electors not having been Prie&s;ts for a long time, tho&s;e of <HI>Mentz</HI> perform that Office in their &s;tead, and the la&s;t have<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">They pretend al&s;o to this right, in quality of the fir&s;t Arch-Bi&s;hops. The Emperour now reigning was Crowned by the Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Cologne.</HI></NOTE> &s;ince remained in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that Privi|ledge.</P>
<P>I am inform'd that there are here many <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> known to be &s;uch: They go into the Lands of the Duke of <HI>New|bourg,</HI> to exerci&s;e their Religion. They are always call'd by their old name of

<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">Tho&s;e who pre&s;ented the Petition were Habited all alike. They never take it ill to be called <HI>Gueux,</HI> and to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves by that Name, they hung a Medal at their Necks, upon which, on one &s;ide, was the Effigies of the King, <HI>(Philip II.)</HI> and on the other, two hands joyned to|gether, which held two Budgets, with divers little Porringers, and round about was written, <HI>Faithful to the King even to Beggary.</HI> Gab. Chappuys, <HI>Hi&s;t. of the Wars of</HI> Flanders.</NOTE> <HI>Gueux,</HI> or <HI>Beggars,</HI> which, as you know, was given at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> to the Authors of the Agreement, by the Count <HI>de Barlemont.</HI></P>
<P>The Town-Hou&s;e is a great <HI>Gothick</HI> Building. We &s;aw there, among&s;t other things, Chambers full of Bows, Arrows, Cro&s;s-Bows, Quivers, Bucklers, and other ancient Arms. I mea&s;ured one of tho&s;e great Cro&s;s-Bows which had need of Re&s;ts; The Bow was of Whale-Bone, and had twelve Foot of length, eight Inches broad, and four Inches thick. It is very plea|&s;ant to behold <HI>Cologne,</HI> and the delicate Country about it, from the top of the Tower of this Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The little part of the City, which is on the other &s;ide of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> is the Propriety of the Elector, and is the Quarter allotted to the <HI>Jews.</HI></P>
<P>The Cathedral Church remains in a very imperfect State; it is great pity &s;o fine a beginning &s;hould never attain its end. In the Year 1622. the three pretended Kings, who came to adore our Saviour, were brought from <HI>Milan</HI> into this Church,<NOTE PLACE="marg">When <HI>Frede|rick Barba|ro&s;&s;a</HI> cau&s;ed <HI>Milan</HI> to be</NOTE> where Fame attributes many Miracles to them. They &s;ell for a peny a dozen little Billets, which have touched them, and com|municate their Virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="32">An extraordinary Drought having cau&s;ed a Famine in <HI>Hungary</HI> (I know not po&s;i|tively in what time it was) a great number of the People of that Country, came to &s;upplicate the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the three Kings, after they had in vain invoked the Saints of their Country and Neighbourhood; who had no &s;ooner &s;poke the word, but it rained in great abundance. From that time a Proce&s;&s;ion of <HI>Hungarians</HI> comes every &s;eventh Year to pay Homage to their Be|nefactors; and the&s;e People are treated and waited upon by the Magi&s;trates for fifteen days, in a very fine Hou&s;e built on purpo&s;e for them.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved a hole three or four Foot wide, on the top of the Vaulted Roof of the Church, and almo&s;t over the Chapel, where are kept the&s;e Royal Reliques. There are the&s;e words written round this Overture, <HI>Anno</HI> 1404. 30.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> To. II. Letter xxiii.</NOTE> <HI>Octob. ventus de nocte flat ingens grandem per tectum lapi|dem pellit. On the</HI> 30th. <HI>of</HI> October, <HI>in the Year</HI> 1404. <HI>a great Wind blew in the Night, and drove a great Stone through the Roof.</HI> This Stone lies on the Pavement near the Cha|pel. Our Guide told us, they call'd it, <HI>the Devil's Stone,</HI> becau&s;e it is believed, the Devil threw it out of Malice to de&s;troy the Chapel. I ob&s;erv'd likewi&s;e in the &s;ame Church, over one of the doors, thirty &s;ix gilded Staves, about three foot long each; and this Di&s;tich is written underneath:
<Q><L>Quot pendere vides Baculos tot Epi&s;copus Annos</L>
<L>Huic Agrippinae praefuit Eccle&s;iae.</L></Q>

And in effect, the Elector is at this time in the thirty &s;eventh Year of his Arch-Bi|&s;hoprick. But I could not learn neither the Original, nor the Benefit of this Cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>We &s;aw, as we pa&s;&s;ed, the curious Church of the Je&s;uits, and from thence went to that of St. <HI>Ur&s;ula.</HI> You know, without doubt, the Legend of this Saint, and of her eleven thou&s;and Virgins, who were Ma&s;&s;acred with her by the <HI>Huns</HI> at <HI>Cologne,</HI> in the Year 238. Tho&s;e who fir&s;t wrote this Story, &s;uppo&s;ed that there was one <HI>Etherus,</HI> King of <HI>England,</HI> and Husband of <HI>Ur&s;ula,</HI> and one Pope <HI>Cyriack,</HI> his Con|temporary, Per&s;ons of whom no notice is taken in Hi&s;tory. In the mean time, every one of the eleven thou&s;and Virgins, have done eleven thou&s;and Miracles, and fur|ni&s;hed a great number of Reliques. The Body of <HI>Ur&s;ula</HI> lay for a long time con|founded among&s;t the re&s;t; but they &s;ay it was at la&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed by a Pigeon; who, for &s;everal days, came regularly at a &s;et hour to her Tomb: And at pre&s;ent the Saint is laid near her Husband <HI>Etherus.</HI> The Church is filled with the Tombs of many of the Virgins, and you find always a multitude of Old-Women in it, repeating of <HI>Pater-no&s;ters</HI> from Morning to Night. They &s;ay the Earth of this Church will not endure any other dead Corps; and to prove this, they there &s;hew the Tomb of a Daughter of a certain Duke of <HI>Brabant,</HI> who, after they had forcibly Interred her there, rai&s;ed up her &s;elf, and remained in
<PB N="39" REF="33">
the Air, &s;o that they were fain to fix her with Iron, as &s;he is now two or three Feet from the Earth, again&s;t one of the Pillars of the Church.</P>
<P>It is plea&s;ant to &s;ee in a great Chapel, which is on the &s;ide of this &s;ame Church, the Bones of the Virgins, with which it is adorned and hung, after the manner which you &s;ee the Swords and Pi&s;tols ranged at <HI>White-Hall,</HI> in the Guard-Chamber. The&s;e Bones, except the Heads, have no Orna|ments, but to the Heads they have done particular Honours; for &s;ome of them are put up in ca&s;es of Silver, and others have coverings of Gold, there is none which have not at lea&s;t their Caps of Cloath of Gold, or a Bonnet of Crim&s;on-Velvet, wrought with Pearls and Jewels. Behold, Sir, what, together with the pretended three Kings, is the chief Object of the Devotion of <HI>Cologne,</HI> and from whence it comes to be called <HI>Cologne the Holy:</HI> and from hence al&s;o it is, that the Arms of this City are, <HI>Argent, eleven Flames Gules,</HI> with a <HI>Chief of the Second, charged with three Crowns Or.</HI> The <HI>eleven Flames</HI> are in Memorial of the eleven thou&s;and Virgins, and the <HI>three Crowns</HI> re|pre&s;ent the three Kings.</P>
<P>In the Church of the <HI>Maccabees</HI> there is a Crucifix which wears a Peruke, which is very &s;ingular; but that which is marvellous and edifying is, that when the <HI>Hungarian</HI> Pilgrims come to <HI>Cologne,</HI> they do each of them cut off a lock of Hair from this Peruke, and yet it never dimini&s;hes.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="34">I ob&s;erv'd, at the entrance into the Church of the Twelve Apo&s;tles, a Picture, which repre&s;ents a very rare Event; which never|thele&s;s might ea&s;ily be received for Truth, if the end of the Story did not render it &s;u&s;picious. The Wife of a Con&s;ul of <HI>Cologne,</HI> being Buried in the Year 1571. with a Ring of great Price, the Sexton, the Night following, opened the Tomb to &s;teal the Ring; I leave you to judge if he were not frighted when he felt his hand caught hold of, and when the good Lady gra&s;ped him to get out of the Sepulchre, and yet he loo&s;ed him&s;elf and fled away, without further Conver&s;ation. The Per&s;on rai&s;ed, unwrapped her &s;elf as well as &s;he could, and went to knock at the door of her Hou&s;e; She called a Servant by his Name, and in few words told him the &s;umm of her Adventure, that he might not let her Peri&s;h with Cold: But the Man thought her a Gho&s;t, and all in a fright run to tell the thing to his Ma&s;ter. (So far may be true, now comes the Fable.) The Ma&s;ter, as incredulous as the Man, called him Fool, and &s;aid he would as &s;oon be|lieve his Hor&s;es were in the Garret, and in&s;tantly a mo&s;t dreadful noi&s;e was heard in the Garret; the Man went up thither, and found &s;ix Coach-Hor&s;es there, without counting the re&s;t in the Stable. The Con&s;ul, amazed at &s;o many Prodigies, was not able to &s;peak; the Man was in an Exta&s;ie or Swound in the Garret, and the living deceas'd, quaking in her Shroud,
<PB N="41" REF="34">
was expecting to be let in: at la&s;t it came to pa&s;s that the door was opened, and they chafed and us'd her &s;o well, that &s;he reviv'd as if nothing had pa&s;s'd; and the next day they made Machines nece&s;&s;ary to let down the Hor&s;es. And to make the truth of this appear, there is at this day to be &s;een in the Garret, &s;ome Wooden Hor&s;es, which are covered with the others Skins. And they &s;hew in the Church of the Twelve Apo&s;tles, a great piece of Linen Cloath which this Woman Spun after her return to the World; in which &s;he lived &s;even Years afterwards.</P>
<P>I have nothing further to tell you of <HI>Cologne,</HI> only that this is the Country where|in we fir&s;t begun to find Vines; tho' Wine here is very dear in the Hou&s;es of Enter|tainment.

<P>As we parted from <HI>Baccharach,</HI> a furious Storm aro&s;e, which ca&s;t away a large Boat, and ours was not without &s;ome danger. We went a&s;hore a little before we came to <HI>Rudi&s;heim,</HI> where the bad Weather con|&s;trained us to &s;tay a while; and we pa&s;&s;ed by an old ruinous Hou&s;e, which they &s;aid belonged to that wicked Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Mentz,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mentz</HI> was made an Arch-Bi&s;hoprick by Pope <HI>Zachary, Anno, 745.</HI></NOTE> who was eaten by Rats. The <HI>Rhine</HI> makes there a little I&s;land, in the mid&s;t of which is a &s;quare Tower, which they call the <HI>Tower of Rats:</HI> And it is commonly reported, that this Prelate, who was then the mo&s;t wicked and cruel Man alive, fell &s;ick in that Hou&s;e which I lately mentioned (&s;ome &s;ay it was in another a little further off, but that is nothing to the Story,) and that, by an extraordinary Judgment of God, he was environed with Rats, which could by no means be driven away. They add, that he cau&s;ed him&s;elf to be carried into the I&s;land, where he hoped he might have been freed from them, but the Rats multiplied, &s;wam over the River and devoured him. An ingenious Man, whom I &s;aw in this place, a&s;&s;ured me, that he had read this Story in &s;ome old Chronicles of the Coun|try. He &s;aid he remembred, that the Arch-Bi&s;hop was there nam'd <HI>Renald,</HI> and that this happened in the Tenth Age. I
<PB N="45" REF="36">
would willingly give credit to this Story, but I fear however that there is &s;ome mi|&s;take in it. For I know that about this time there was a certain Prie&s;t, named <HI>Ar|nald,</HI> who fraudulently di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Arch-Bi&s;hop <HI>Henry;</HI> and that this <HI>Arnald</HI> was Ma&s;&s;acred by the People, which may have given occa&s;ion to &s;ome confu&s;ion in the&s;e Hi&s;tories. Another Per&s;on told me, that the Name of the Arch-Bi&s;hop was <HI>Hatton</HI> II. &s;urnamed <HI>Bono&s;us;</HI> and that in a time of Famine, he cau&s;ed a great number of poor People to be a&s;&s;embled in a Barn, where he caus'd them to be burnt, &s;aying, <HI>The&s;e are the unprofitable Vermine, which are good for no|thing but to con&s;ume the Bread which &s;hould &s;erve for the Su&s;tenance of others.</HI> However,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pliny,</HI> upon the Te&s;timony of <HI>Varro,</HI> relates that the I&s;le of <HI>Gyara,</HI> one of the <HI>Cyclades,</HI> was abandoned by the Inhabi|tants becau&s;e of Rats.

Ca&s;tles there are al&s;o very frequent, mo&s;t of them built on a&s;cents, and even on the points of the &s;harpe&s;t Rocks. I counted forty &s;ince my departure from <HI>Cologne.</HI></P>

<P>The bad Weather hindred us from &s;eeing the Ar&s;enal, as well as the Citadel and o|ther Fortifications. But we were a&s;&s;ured our lo&s;s was not great, there being nothing at all rare in any of them.</P>
<P>They told us, that in the middle of the Citadel there is a kind of Tower, com|monly call'd the Tomb of <HI>Dru&s;us.

that his Body was carried to <HI>Rome</HI> to be burnt in the Field of <HI>Mars.</HI> It is true, that after <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> had cau&s;ed the Senate to give him the Surname of <HI>Germanicus,</HI> he al&s;o made Statues to be erected for him, with triumphal Arches, and other Monu|ments on the Banks of the <HI>Rhine:</HI> And perhaps this Tower or Mau&s;oleum was one of his honorary Tombs, which the Anci|ents call'd <GAP DESC="foreign">.</P>
<P>The Ornaments in which the Electors cele|brate Ma&s;s are extraordinary Rich: And the Canopy under which the Ho&s;t is carried, on certain occa&s;ions, is all covered with Pearls.

On the &s;ide of this Chamber is the Hall, where certain Ceremonies are ob|&s;erved which &s;ucceed the Election; and when they are over, the Emperour de&s;cends from the Hall, and goes to the Church, where he is Crowned.</P>
<P>The Golden Bull is a Book of twenty four Leaves of Parchment, in <HI>Quarto,</HI> which are &s;ewed together, and covered with ano|ther piece of Parchment, without any Or|nament. The Seal is fa&s;tned to it by a &s;ilken String of many Colours, and is co|vered with Gold, &s;o as it re&s;embles a Me|dal: It is two Inches and a half in breadth, and a large Line in thickne&s;s. Upon the Seal is the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> IV. Seated and Crowned, holding a Scepter in his Right-hand, and the Globe in his Left. The Shield of the Empire is on his Right, and that of <HI>Bohemia</HI> on his Left. And a|bout it is written, <HI>Carolus quartus divin&acirc; fa|vente clementi&acirc; Romanorum Imperator &s;emper Augu&s;tus,</HI> and on each &s;ide near the two Scutcheons, <HI>Et Bohemiae Rex.</HI> On the Re|ver&s;e there is a kind of a Gate of a Ca&s;tle between two Towers, which appa|rently denotes <HI>Rome,</HI> this Ver&s;e being writ|ten about:

And upon the Gate between the two Towers, <HI>Roma aurea.</HI></P>
<P>This Bull was given at <HI>Nuremberg,</HI> in the Year 1356. by the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> IV. with the con&s;ent of all the States of the Empire. The de&s;ign of the In&s;titutors was, that this Edict &s;hould be perpetual and irre|revocable, yet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Particularly in the Treaties of <HI>We&s;tphalia.</HI></NOTE> many Innovations have been made &s;ince.

The Bull is written in <HI>Latin.</HI></NOTE> the King of the <HI>Romans,</HI> whom it fre|quently &s;tiles the Temporal Head of the Chri&s;tian World. It regulates many things that relate to the Electors, touching their Rank, their A&s;&s;emblies, their Rights and Immunities, the Right of Succe&s;&s;ion to the Electorate, and the Manner after which every one of them is to perform his Functi|on in publick Ceremonies. It ordains the&s;e Princes to a&s;&s;emble once in the Year to &s;ettle the Affairs of the Empire. The E|lector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> in conjunction with the Elector Palatine, are declared Regents, after the Death of the Emperour. But things, as you know, having been changed in favour of the Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> that Elector pretends to the Regency.

<P>They &s;ay, that a Lord of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Alberg,</HI> having brought a great many <HI>Jews</HI> from <HI>Pale&s;tine,</HI> &s;old Thirty of them for a Piece of Silver, at the City of <HI>Worms:</HI> where they were for a long time treated as Slaves, before they could obtain the Liberty which they at pre&s;ent enjoy in common with the other Inhabitants.</P>
<P>The Church of St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;eems to be an ancient Building, but I believe that of St. <HI>John</HI> is the older. This la&s;t is built with very great &s;quare Stones, and its Figure is quite irregular. The Walls are above twelve Foot thick, the Windows are narrow, and there are Galleries all round the out&s;ide of the Building ju&s;t under the Roof. There is but little Appearance that this was built for a Church: the Cathedral is a long Structure of a con&s;iderable Height, with a Tower at each of the four Corners; the whole Build|ing is very ma&s;&s;ive, and embelli&s;hed with <HI>Gothick</HI> Ornaments. They &s;hewed us a cer|tain Animal, over one of the Doors of this Church, of which the People tell a hun|dred Stories. This Animal is as big as an A&s;s, and hath four Heads; one Head of a Man, one of an Oxe, one of an Eagle,
<PB N="57" REF="42">
and one of a Lion: it lifts up the two fir&s;t, and hangs down the other two. The right Foot before is a Man's, the left an Oxe's, the two hinder Feet are of an Eagle and a Lion: and a Woman &s;its upon the Bea&s;t. If I dur&s;t penetrate into this My&s;tery, I think it might be conjectured, that this Hie|roglyphick is a Chimera compo&s;ed of the four Animals in the Vi&s;ion of <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> and that the Woman repre&s;ents the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>I took notice of a Picture, over the Al|tar of one of the Chapels of this Church, in which the Virgin is repre&s;ented receiving Chri&s;t as he de&s;cends from the Cro&s;s, while &s;everal Angels carry the In&s;truments of the Crucifixion to Heaven. But either the Pain|ter has forgot, or el&s;e the Angels have &s;ince brought back all the&s;e Reliques.</P>
<P>There is another very curious Picture, at the Entrance of the Church of St. <HI>Martin,</HI> over a moveable Altar. This Picture is about five Foot Square. God the Father is on the Top of one Corner, from whence he &s;eems to &s;peak to the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> who is on her knees in the mid&s;t of the Picture: &s;he holds the little Infant Je&s;us by the Feet, and puts his Head into the Hopper of a Mill: the twelve Apo&s;tles turn the Mill by a Wheel, with their Hands, and they are a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the&s;e four Bea&s;ts of <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> which we ju&s;t &s;poke of, who work on the other &s;ide. Not far off the Pope kneels to receive the Ho&s;ts, which fall from the Mill ready made into a Cup of Gold. He pre&s;ents one to a Car|dinal,
<PB N="58" REF="43">
the Cardinal gives it to a Bi&s;hop, the Bi&s;hop to a Prie&s;t, and the Prie&s;t to the People.</P>
<P>There are in the City two publick Hou|&s;es; one of which is called the Burgher's Hou&s;e, in which the Senate a&s;&s;embles twice every Week, about the Affairs of the State: the other is for the Magi&s;tracy, and is the Place where common Cau&s;es are pleaded. It was in the fir&s;t that <HI>Luther</HI> made his Ap|pearance on an occa&s;ion known to all the World. They tell us, that this Doctor, ha|ving &s;poke with much eagerne&s;s, and being be&s;ides heated by the fire which was before him, &s;ome body brought him a Gla&s;s of Wine, which he receiv'd; but &s;uch was his ve|hemence, that he forgot to drink, and with|out thinking of it, &s;et it on a Bench which was by his &s;ide: they add, that the Gla&s;s im|mediately after broke without any Per&s;on's touching it, and it pa&s;&s;ed for current that the Wine was poi&s;oned. I will make no Glo&s;s upon this Story. But afterwards the Bench on which he &s;et the Gla&s;s was bro|ken, and &s;ome Pieces were taken out of it, which &s;ome zealous <HI>Lutherans</HI> keep in memo|ry of their Ma&s;ter.</P>

They al&s;o &s;hew another little round piece of Vellum, about the bigne&s;s of a Guiney, upon which the Lord's-Prayer, without abbreviation, is written. But this is no extraordinary thing. I know a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Maximin Mo&s;&s;ileni.</NOTE> Man who wrote the &s;ame Prayer &s;ix times in the &s;ame compa&s;s, more di&s;tinctly. This Hou&s;e hath a long <HI>Portico,</HI> between the Arches of which hang great Bones and Horns. They &s;ay the Bones are the Bones of Giants, and the Horns the Horns of the Oxen which drew the Stones with which the Cathedral is built. And are not the&s;e very curious and venerable Pieces? The out&s;ide of the Hou&s;e is full of &s;everal Pictures, among&s;t which there are many of Armed Giants, which in the In&s;cription below are called <HI>Vangiones.</HI> We know very well that the People who formerly inhabited this part of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> were called <HI>Vangiones,</HI> as we find in <HI>Tacitus,</HI> and others. But I cannot tell the rea&s;on, why they would have the&s;e <HI>Vangiones</HI> to be Giants. Neverthele&s;s, the&s;e great Men there make a great noi&s;e at <HI>Worms,</HI> they tell a thou&s;and Stories of them, and when they have done, every one is at liberty to &s;ay what he plea&s;es of them.</P>
<P>We only pa&s;&s;ed by <HI>Frankendal,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">FRANKEN|DAL.</NOTE> the For|tifications of which are pretty good, and would be better if they were lined; but
<PB N="60" REF="44">
they are forced to &s;lope them too much, be|cau&s;e the too &s;oft and ill cemented Earth could not otherwi&s;e be &s;upported. This defect is yet apparently greater in the For|tifications of <HI>Manheim.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">MANHEIM.</NOTE> The&s;e two little places belong to the Elector Palatine. 'Tis but two hours Travel from one to the other. The &s;ituation of <HI>Manheim</HI> is its greate&s;t Strength: For it is not commanded by any ri&s;ing Ground, and is almo&s;t &s;urrounded by the <HI>Neckar</HI> and the <HI>Rhine.</HI> There is a good Gari&s;on in the Citadel, but the greate&s;t Rarity that I found in it is the Temple of Concord. The Elector <HI>Charles Louis,</HI> Fa|ther of <HI>Charles the La&s;t,</HI> Decea&s;ed, cau&s;ed this Church to be built, to &s;erve in common for the <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> both <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Lu|therans.</HI> But this Prince being of a plea&s;ant Humour, and not very &s;crupulous about Religion, the fir&s;t day they Preach'd in this Church, permitted a Curate of the Neigh|bourhood to Preach there al&s;o; who made rather an Encomium of the Prince, than a Sermon. But they pretended not then that this was to be continued by cour&s;e, and after that time the <HI>Lutherans,</HI> with the other Reformi&s;ts, &s;olely made u&s;e of the Church. But in fine, this pre&s;ent Elector being a <HI>Romani&s;ts,</HI> hath thought fit to joyn tho&s;e of his Communion with the others. And be|&s;ides his Will, which is mo&s;t &s;trong and pre|valent, he pretends this rea&s;on, that it is not contrary to the Will of the Founder, which he proves from the Harangue of the Curate. Therefore now the three Mini|&s;ters
<PB N="61" REF="44">
of the three Religions, perform each in their turn the Service in the Church of Concord. They begin and end &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, in &s;uch manner as in three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Sun|days, each of the three Mini&s;ters hath the priviledge to begin fir&s;t, as al&s;o to be &s;e|cond or third. The Church is not great, but is very fine. The Pulpit is in common, when the <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> have ended Ma&s;s, they draw the Curtain, and hide the Al|tar.</P>
<P>About forty Years ago, <HI>Manheim</HI> was but a little Village, <HI>Frederick,</HI> Father of <HI>Charles Louis,</HI> cau&s;ed it to be fortified, and named it <HI>Fredericksburg;</HI> at the &s;ame time this City was built, which re&s;um'd the name of <HI>Manheim,</HI> and was fortified al&s;o. All the Streets are in &s;traight Lines, and in &s;ome are Trees planted, as in <HI>Holland. Manheim</HI> is a very pretty place. Every day at five of the Clock in the Morning, at Noon and at &s;ix in the Evening, there are hired Mu&s;icians, who &s;ing part of a P&s;alm on the Tower of the Town-hou&s;e. They have &s;uch loud In&s;truments that they are heard all over the Town. This is done in mo&s;t places of the Palatinate.</P>
<P>When we left <HI>Manheim,</HI> after we had pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Neckar,</HI> over a Bridge of Boats, we traver&s;ed a very fertile Plain, which continued for three hours, to the foot of the Mountains of <HI>Heidelberg.</HI> The&s;e Moun|tains make a long ridge as if they would hinder ones going further: Yet there we met with an opening, through which the
<PB N="62" REF="45">
<HI>Neckar</HI> goes out. This River is pa&s;&s;ed over on a cover'd Bridge, and you find the City of <HI>Heidelberg</HI> on the other &s;ide, which lies high and low among&s;t the Trees and Rocks. It is no very fine City, and I know not by what Spirit of Contradiction, they have built it almo&s;t all of Wood, whereas they might have had good Stone in abun|dance. The Prince's Palace is upon an a&s;cent, it con&s;i&s;ts of many Pieces begun and not fini&s;hed.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">This City was Storm'd, and utterly laid wa&s;te by the <HI>French, May 22. 1693.</HI></NOTE> The whole is built of hewn Stone, and there are &s;ome parts of this Structure of fine Architecture. They have made fine Gardens among&s;t the Rocks, but for all the care they have taken to adorn the place, it is &s;till Melancholy and Irregular, if we take all together; and I think it would be prai&s;e enough, to call this Hou&s;e a magnificent Hermitage.

<P>The Tabacco and the Hops &s;upply the place of Vines, when you approach this Place, and the mountainous Country be|gins to grow plain and lower; &s;o that you may &s;ee the great and fair City of <HI>Nurem|berg</HI> at a good di&s;tance.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>NUREM|BERG,</HI> an Imperial City.</NOTE> Before we came at it, we often found our &s;elves on the Banks of the little River of <HI>Pegnitz,</HI> which runs from it, but &s;erves only to turn the Mills.

The Tradition of the Country will have <HI>Nuremberg</HI> to be built by <HI>Nero,</HI> and there is one of the Towers of the Ca&s;tle which is called the Tower of <HI>Nero,</HI> but this is but a poor Argument; I rather think that <HI>Nori|berga,</HI> called al&s;o in Latine <HI>Mons Noricorum,</HI> was derived from <HI>Noricum,</HI> the old Name of the Country, and the word <HI>Berg,</HI> which in high Dutch &s;ignifies a Mountain.</P>

<P>The Town-Hou&s;e is very great, and has a very beautiful and well-proportion'd Front, but it wants a Court before it. When we went from thence, our Friends brought us to the City Cellar, which is two hundred and fifty Paces long, and contains, as they

tell us, Twenty thou&s;and Aums of Wine, that is to &s;ay, Twenty thou&s;and middle|&s;iz'd Tuns. We mu&s;t allow it to be a very fair Cellar: but the truth is, &s;uch Peo|ple as we, know not how to enjoy all the Plea&s;ures of it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Germans</HI> are, you know,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Germanorum vivere bibere e&s;t.</NOTE> &s;trange Drinkers; but there are no People in the World more obliging, more civil, or more officious, and yet they have terrible Cu|&s;toms as to the Point of Drinking. Every thing is done there by drinking, and they drink in all they do. There is not time given to &s;peak three Words in a Vi&s;it, but pre&s;ently comes the Collation, or at lea&s;t &s;ome large Jacks of Wine, with a Plate full of Cru&s;ts of Bread ha&s;h'd with Pepper and Salt, a fatal Preparative for puny Topers. But before we proceed I mu&s;t give you an account of tho&s;e &s;acred and inviolable Laws that are afterwards to be ob&s;erv'd. Every Draught mu&s;t be a Health, and a&s;&s;oon as you have emptied your Gla&s;s, you mu&s;t pre&s;ent it full to him who&s;e Health you drunk. You mu&s;t never refu&s;e the Gla&s;s which is pre&s;ented, and you mu&s;t drink it off to the la&s;t drop. Do but re|flect a little on the&s;e Cu&s;toms, and &s;ee how it is po&s;&s;ible to leave off drinking: And in|deed they never make an end,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> &s;ai h in his Voyage, that the <HI>Germans</HI> have &s;ucceeded better than all the Mathematicians of the World in finding out the perpetual Motion, by the continual Agitation of their Cups.</NOTE> but ca|rou&s;e in a perpetual Round: to drink in <HI>Germany</HI> is to drink eternally.

Entertainment in the Cellar. You mu&s;t do penance there for &s;ome time, and at la&s;t hide your &s;elf behind the Casks, &s;teal away and make your e&s;cape.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t further know, that the Gla&s;&s;es are as much re&s;pected in this Country as the Wine is beloved. They place them all <HI>en Parade.</HI> The greate&s;t part of the Cham|bers are wain&s;cotted, even to two thirds of the Walls, and the Gla&s;&s;es are ranged all about, upon the Corni&s;h of the Wain|&s;cot, like Pipes of Organs. They begin with the Little, and end with the Great ones; and the&s;e Great ones are always us'd, and mu&s;t be empty'd at a draught, when there is any Health of Importance. At going out of the Cellar we went to Con&s;ort, where we hoped we &s;hould do nothing but &s;ing, but the Bread, the Pepper, the Salt, and the Wine followed in &s;uch a|bundance, that an Air was no &s;ooner fini&s;h|ed, but the whole Company ro&s;e up to drink.</P>

<P>The Husband was in Black Cloaths, with a Cloak over-laid with Lace, a great Ruff, and a little Crown of Gold Plate-Lace a|bove his Peruke. But the Wife's Dre&s;s will be a little more difficult to de&s;cribe. The be&s;t Account I can give you of it, is to tell you, That in framing to your &s;elf an Idea of her Head-Tire, you mu&s;t fan&s;ie a Mixture of Plate-Wire gilded, like a Bob-Peruke, half a Foot higher than her Fore|head, and very much frizzed and &s;welled out on the Sides. This was ordered after &s;uch a manner, that in all the Thickne&s;s of this Bu&s;h there was no more &s;pace or di|&s;tance between the Threads, than was &s;uffi|cient to fa&s;ten to them an infinite Number of little Plates of Gold, round, poli&s;hed and &s;hining, which hung both within and without, and waved with the lea&s;t Motion. Her Habit was Black, with long Skirts re|&s;embling the <HI>Hongrelines</HI> which were not ve|ry long &s;ince u&s;ed in <HI>France.</HI> The Body of this little Ca&s;&s;ock, which was cut very &s;hort, had a Gold Lace over all the Seams. The Skirts were full of little clo&s;e Knots of black Sattin Ribbon, and the
<PB N="74" REF="54">
&s;treight Cuffs fell ju&s;t on the Fi&s;t. Over this &s;he had a Neck-band of Fine Antique Lace, cut before like a Man's Band, and ending in a Point behind, which reached down to the middle of the Back. She had be&s;ides a great Gold Chain on her Shoulders, ju&s;t like the Collar of &s;ome Order, and &s;uch another Chain for her Girdle. Her Pet|ticoat was &s;hort enough, and adorn'd below with Gold Fringe and Black Bone-Lace. We had the Plea&s;ure to &s;ee this Fair one dance with a Senatour in a great Ruff; and I believe at <HI>Japan</HI> there could not be found Cu&s;toms more different from ours, than tho&s;e which we ob&s;erved at this Fea&s;t. I &s;hould never make an End if I &s;hould un|dertake to de&s;cribe all the other Habits. But, as fanta&s;tical as all the&s;e Dre&s;&s;es might &s;eem at fir&s;t view, one might be ea&s;ily accu&s;tom'd to them, and every Habit appears hand|&s;om and becoming, when the Per&s;ons that wear them are of them&s;elves beautiful and agreeable.</P>

I can|not expre&s;s the Particular Kindne&s;s they have for Horns; for all their Hou&s;es are full of them. They are every where in|&s;tead of Pictures, and other curious things.

<P>We were but poorly treated on all the Road from <HI>Heidelberg,</HI> and Straw was com|monly our Bed.

&s;tronge&s;t place. It is indifferently large. The mo&s;t part of the Hou&s;es are painted or whited without. The Streets are broad, &s;traight, and well pav'd: And the whole City &s;eemed plea&s;ant enough, though it be poor and ill Peopled. They boa&s;t much of the <HI>Ar&s;enal,</HI> but you mu&s;t be put to trouble to obtain liberty to &s;ee it, &s;o that we would not take the pains. I know very well that the&s;e inacce&s;&s;ible Ar&s;enals are com|monly the wor&s;t provided for; if they were well filled and furni&s;hed, they would make a publick Show of them, rather than hide them. But they excu&s;e them&s;elves upon &s;ome &s;ecret Rea&s;ons, when they have no|thing to &s;how but Cro&s;s-Bows and ru&s;ty Firelocks. Nothing is more ea&s;ily obtain'd, than the &s;ight of the Ar&s;enals of <HI>France,</HI> and it is as true, that nothing is finer and in better order.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erv'd at <HI>Ingol&s;tadt,</HI> as in mo&s;t of the other Cities of <HI>Germany,</HI> that every where near the Fountains there are Casks of Wood or Bra&s;s, mounted on little Car|riages with four Wheels, which &s;erve to carry Water when any Fire happens. And this is very wi&s;ely contriv'd; But they have another Cu&s;tom throughout all this Coun|try, which we thought much more trouble|&s;ome than u&s;eful. The&s;e are certain Singers in the Night, who trot about every hour: They gave notice to beware of Fire, and afterwards exhort us to &s;leep quietly, with|out con&s;idering that their horrid Mu&s;ick keeps all the City awake.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="56"><NOTE PLACE="marg">NEW|BOURG.</NOTE>We came from <HI>Ingol&s;tadt</HI> to <HI>Newbourg,</HI> which is a very little City, and without Fortifications. It &s;tands on the right Bank of the <HI>Danube,</HI> which is grown broad and rapid, tho' at this place, it be very far di|&s;tant from its main &s;trength. We pa&s;t it over a Bridge to go up into the City, at our entry we had a view of the Ca&s;tle, which is &s;eated on a Rock. Though the out&s;ides are with|out Ornaments, yet they make a hand&s;ome appearance. Within there are great Ap|partments, even with the Ground, which are very convenient. But the <HI>Elector Pa|latine,</HI> to whom this <HI>Dutchy</HI> of <HI>Newbourg</HI> belongs, was con&s;train'd to &s;end all the Furniture of this Ca&s;tle to that of <HI>Heidel|berg,</HI> this la&s;t being &s;tripp'd, as I have al|ready told you: There remains only one Cabinet, which is full of rare Pictures and other Curio&s;ities, which we had not time to examine particularly. I remember to have ob&s;erved a round piece of very hard Stone, which weighs four pound, and was found in the Body of a Hor&s;e: I believe we might ju&s;tly call this Stone a kind of <HI>Bezoar,</HI> &s;ince according to the report of <HI>Tavernier,</HI> the <HI>Bezoar</HI> is found in the Paunches of Cows and Apes, as well as in tho&s;e of Goats.</P>
<P>The Church of the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> is the faire&s;t in the City, but there is a plea&s;ant thing to be &s;een in that of St. <HI>Peter, Mark d'Aviano,</HI> the <HI>Capouchin,</HI> famous for the Miracles which are attributed to him, was at <HI>Newbourg,</HI> about five Years &s;ince. As he went into
<PB N="79" REF="56">
St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Church, he perceiv'd in a corner an old <HI>No&s;tradame</HI> of Wood, which was all mangl'd, and covered over with Du&s;t. The zealous Father could not without Grief be|hold our <HI>Lady</HI> in &s;o unbecoming a condi|tion. He pro&s;trated him&s;elf before her, and began to thump his Brea&s;t, and to break out into Lamentations. As he was in the mid&s;t of his Groans, he &s;uddenly cry'd out. <HI>A Miracle!</HI> and prote&s;ted that the good <HI>Lady</HI> had mov'd her Eyes, and look'd on him. There were then many old Women in the Church, who ran to|gether at the cries of the <HI>Capouchin,</HI> and with joy embraced the occa&s;ion that they were able to &s;ay, that they had been witne&s;&s;es to a Miracle: There was no need of many Arguments to convince them, for they all cried out with the <HI>Capouchin,</HI> that our <HI>Lady</HI> had look'd upon him: Immediately he went out with them, and fill'd all the City with the noi&s;e of the pretended Miracle. He was &s;upported by the great ones, and after certain Preambles, which 'tis needle&s;s to relate, they went to St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s in Pro|ce&s;&s;ion: They cleaned the Statue, took the Sacrament off the great Altar which was dedicated to it, dre&s;s'd our <HI>Lady</HI> in a &s;plendid Habit, and plac'd her on that Al|tar, where &s;he works Miracles by Millions. The Princes and the People load her with Pre&s;ents, and People come from all parts in Pilgrimage to her.</P>

All the floors of the Chambers are pav'd with a certain yellowi&s;h Marble which comes from <HI>Tirol;</HI> and the Ceilings are either of Joyners-work, with Compartiments, or of a certain Cement, which poli&s;hes very well, and is very durable. But there is one great Irregularity in all their manner of Building.

It is I know not how long &s;ince, they dug out a Pillar five or &s;ix Foot high, over which was the figure of a Pine-Apple. There were al&s;o found &s;ome Medals of <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> on the Rever&s;e of which the like Pillar is to be &s;een. As it was the u&s;ual Cu&s;tom, to mark out by &s;ome bounds, the increa&s;e of the Empire, on the Frontiers of the Conquer'd Countries, and to joyn to tho&s;e limits &s;ome repre&s;entations of the things which were mo&s;t common in the new Pro|vinces: It is very probable, that this was the u&s;e of the Pillar I ju&s;t now mention'd, and of the Pine-Apple which is over it; for all this part of <HI>Germany</HI> is full of Pines and Firr-Trees. There is al&s;o a great deal of appearance, that for this rea&s;on <HI>Ausbourg</HI> bears a <HI>Pine-Apple</HI> in its Arms.</P>
<P>Though there be hardly any thing good or regular in the Fortifications of this Town, yet hath it &s;ometimes &s;u&s;tain'd very rude A&s;&s;aults with much vigour. It is now
<PB N="82" REF="58">
Forty three Years, &s;ince the <HI>Swedes</HI> and <HI>French</HI> be&s;ieged it, and reduced it to Famine, without being able to take it. It is an Im|perial City, and its Senate are half <HI>Luthe|rans,</HI> and half <HI>Roman Catholicks:</HI> But this Senate is not the &s;ole Ma&s;ter of the State; five or &s;ix Sovereigns &s;hare it among them. A good part belongs to the Bi&s;hop: Almo&s;t all the Territory is his Deme&s;ne; and he hath his Palace in the City, though he re&s;ides at <HI>Dillengen,</HI> where al&s;o the Univer&s;ity is. You know that all the Bi&s;hops of the Em|pire are Temporal Princes in their Dioce&s;&s;es, except tho&s;e of the Hereditary Countries of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> here make publick Proce&s;&s;ions, and carry the Ho&s;t publickly. The <HI>Lutherans</HI> commonly pull off their Hats when they cannot avoid meeting the Ho&s;t.</P>
<P>They do all they can po&s;&s;ibly, to avoid giving &s;candal to either Party. The Poor of both Religions are put into the &s;ame Ho&s;pitals, and are there a&s;&s;i&s;ted by their own Mini&s;ters without any oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jews</HI> have a &s;eparate place in the City; they are obliged to pay, when they re&s;ort thither, a Florin <HI>per</HI> hour, which is a piece of Money worth about three Shil|lings <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>The Town-Hou&s;e is a great four-&s;quare Building, of very fair hewn Stone. The Portal is of Marble, and almo&s;t all the Rooms are Wain&s;coted and Ciel'd with A&s;h of <HI>Poland,</HI> which is very fine. The great Hall is extreamly Magnificent. It is
<PB N="83" REF="58">
one hundred and ten foot long, fifty eight broad, and fifty two foot high; the Pave|ment is of green Marble. The Walls are covered with Paintings, between which there are many Devices and Emblems, which relate to the Government; but the Roof excells all the re&s;t in Beauty. It con|&s;i&s;ts of Compartments, the Squares and Pannels of which are inriched with gilded Sculptures, and filled with Pictures and o|ther Ornaments. And this is all &s;o well ordered and performed, that it de&s;erves a particular Ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>The Ar&s;enal is very great: The two Halls below are full of Cannon, of which the greate&s;t part are of Bra&s;s. There is a Culverin of Leather twenty &s;ix foot long, which is a &s;ix Pounder. The upper Stories are filled with good Arms.</P>
<P>During the Wars of the Neighbouring Princes, in this la&s;t Age, the People of <HI>Ausbourg</HI> were careful to &s;hut the Gates of the City early at Nights, which Cu&s;tom was trouble&s;ome to Strangers, as well as to them&s;elves. Wherefore they invented a kind of &s;ecret Gate, by which there was Pa&s;&s;age to come in, without fear of &s;urprize or other danger. This Gate remains &s;till with all its Locks and Machines, and is a thing very &s;ingular. I have drawn a de&s;ign of it, which I could &s;hew you, but the de&s;cription would at pre&s;ent be too difficult and tedious.</P>
<P>The Trade of <HI>Ausbourg</HI> decay'd, as that of <HI>Holland</HI> increas'd. Almo&s;t all Merchan|dizes

<P>Three Years after <HI>Gu&s;tavus the Great</HI> had made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of <HI>Ausbourg,</HI> it was retaken by the Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> who took away all the Churches from the <HI>Lutherans;</HI> in which ca&s;e they remained from the Year Thirty five, till Forty eight, at which time all things were re&s;tor'd by the Peace of <HI>Mun&s;ter.</HI> During which interval, the <HI>Lutherans</HI> had no liberty to a&s;&s;emble but in a College, from the Window of which they Preached to the People in the Court-yard. This College is &s;till in their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and I have &s;een a long In&s;cription, which is Graved under the Window, and begins thus: <HI>Praeclu&s;is omnibus Evangelicorum tem|plis, coelum tamen ip&s;is patuit,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>All the Churches of the Profe&s;&s;ors of the Go&s;pel being &s;hut, Heaven was yet open to them,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

From thence we went to the Cathedral, where there is a Gate of Bra&s;s, over which many places of the Sacred Hi|&s;tory are repre&s;ented in <HI>ba&s;&s;o relievo,</HI> and they
<PB N="85" REF="59">
made us ob&s;erve in the Hi&s;tory of the Creation, that it was the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> who created <HI>Eve,</HI> and form'd her out of one of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Ribbs.</P>
<P>They are no le&s;s ingenious at <HI>Ausbourg,</HI> than at <HI>Nuremberg,</HI> and even they excel par|ticularly in Clock and Gold&s;miths-work, and in works in Ivory. We &s;aw &s;everal Clocks which were valued at fifteen or twenty thou&s;and Crowns, they are plac'd in ca&s;es that are very richly wrought. And be&s;ides what relates to the motion of the Stars, and the Divi&s;ion of the Times and Sea&s;ons, they adorn them with many other things, which would be both plea&s;ant and profitable, were they a little more la&s;ting.</P>
<P>Their way of turning in Ivory is very curious, and de&s;erves to be taken notice of with admiration. But one of the rare&s;t Works which I &s;aw here, I &s;hall give you an account of: They are Gla&s;&s;es made hol|low and well &s;haped, with a Ring made of the &s;ame piece in turning, which plays be|tween the bottom and the bowl of the Gla&s;s, without po&s;&s;ibility of taking off. There are an hundred with their Rings in a grain of Pepper of an ordinary &s;ize.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The&s;e Gla&s;&s;es are in my hands.</NOTE> I often examined this little Miracle of Art, and ob&s;erved the &s;tripes and traces of the Tool with which they are turned, &s;o that I found no &s;ecret in it, but that it was the pure work of the Eyes and the Hand.</P>
<P>They have here another very plea&s;ant Bauble, which are Fleas fa&s;tned by the Neck with Chains of Steel. This Chain is
<PB N="86" REF="60">
&s;o fine, that though it be near a Span long, the Flea will lift it up when it leaps. The Animal, Chain and all is &s;old for Ten Pence.</P>
<P>The variety of Habits, and difference of their Colours, is yet greater here than at <HI>Nuremberg.</HI> This is an Affair regulated by the Policy of the Magi&s;trates, and you may know the Quality and Religion of the greate&s;t part of the People, by the difference of their Cloaths. I will only repre&s;ent to you the manner after which the Widow of a <HI>Roman Catholick</HI> Merchant wears Mourn|ing for her Husband. She hath a Chri&s;tning Kercher, well whited and &s;tarched, with Wings and Cornets ordinary for this Dre&s;s, a black Petticoat, and a black Cloak, made like that of a Man, which comes to her Knees. A great white Veil behind, which hangs at the tail of the Kercher, down to her Heels, enlarging it &s;elf by degrees; a piece of the &s;ame Linnen with the Kercher, four foot long, and at lea&s;t two broad, which is very much &s;tarched and &s;tretched on a &s;quare of Wire-thred, fa&s;tned by the middle of one of its ends, ju&s;t below the Lips, and covers all the fore part of the Body.</P>
<P>They have turned a little branch of the River <HI>Leck,</HI> and made it pa&s;s through the Town; the Waters are &s;o clear and good, that they need &s;eek for no other; there are four or five Towers upon this Arm of the River; on the tops of which they have made Fi&s;h-Ponds, and the Mills which are below cau&s;e Pumps to play, which lift up

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Ob&s;erved at my going out of <HI>Ausbourg,</HI> in many Gardens, that they cover all their Vines and Fig-Trees, carefully with Straw or Mats, to pre&s;erve them from the Fro&s;t; the Cold being &s;harper in this Coun|try than in <HI>England,</HI> where we are not obliged to make u&s;e of the&s;e Precautions, though we lie nearer the <HI>North.</HI> It is cer|tainly true, that the divers degrees of Heat and Cold, are not always proportion'd to the diver&s;ity of Climates: There are ter|rible Winters in <HI>Canada</HI> in the mid&s;t of the temperate Zone, whil&s;t every where el&s;e, under the &s;ame Climate, they enjoy a &s;weet and plea&s;ant Air.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="63"><NOTE PLACE="marg">MUNICH.</NOTE>The Country is level enough between <HI>Ausbourg</HI> and <HI>Munich,</HI> but it is not very good; it is every where a mixture of Wood and Fields, and Firr-Trees. <HI>Munich</HI> is not above half &s;o big as <HI>Ausbourg.</HI> It is a fine City, but ill fortified, and has no Trade; and without doubt little notice would be taken of this place, if the Elector's Re|&s;idence were not there, and if that Prince's Palace were not extraordinarily Magnifi|cent. Almo&s;t all the Hou&s;es of the City are painted on the out-&s;ide, but in&s;tead of Painting in <HI>Fre&s;co</HI> or in Oyl, they make u&s;e of a kind of bad Plai&s;ter, which is liable to all the Injuries of the Weather: It wears off quickly, and ri&s;es hollow in many places, which maims all the Figures, and renders them very ugly.</P>
<P>We had heard &s;ome Per&s;ons boa&s;t &s;o much of the Je&s;uits Library, that it was the fir&s;t thing we would &s;ee when we came to <HI>Munich;</HI> but it did not an&s;wer our Ex|pectations. For, be&s;ides that, it is neither very good, nor well conditioned; they or|dered a Brother <HI>Cut-Cabbage,</HI> who knew better what belong'd to the Kitchin than to Books, to &s;hew it us. I confe&s;s I could not believe &s;uch gro&s;s Ignorance could lurk un|der the Habit of one who call'd him&s;elf a Je&s;uite. It was ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible for us to make him under&s;tand, what tho&s;e Au|thors were whom we called <HI>the Fathers.</HI> He pre&s;ently named all the Fathers of his Convent, to try if he could find out whom we looked for. And at la&s;t, with a &s;cow|ling
<PB N="89" REF="63">
look, he pray'd us to talk of &s;omething el&s;e. This is all I can tell you of the Li|brary, and the Library-keeper, or at lea&s;t of his Deputy: For it is not very probable that all the re&s;t of this Society are of the &s;ame Stamp. However, they carry four fair and high Corners in their Caps; and their Hou&s;e may be &s;aid to be a &s;tately Palace. Their Church is al&s;o extreamly fine; it is of but one Body, very high, large, and &s;trongly roofed; the Ve&s;try is full of Riches, and they want no Reliques: They &s;hewed us a Joynt as big as that of an Elephant, or &s;ome huge Animal; and this great Bone, as we were inform'd, is in great veneration with them, as being one of the Joynts of great St. <HI>Chri&s;topher</HI>'s Back-Bone.</P>
<P>Leaving the Church of the Je&s;uites, we went to that of the <HI>Augu&s;tines,</HI> where are Pictures of great value.</P>
<P>We went thence to the <HI>Cajetans,</HI> who have a great and fair Church. I ob&s;erv'd in a Map of <HI>Munich,</HI> that this City bears a Monk for its Arms,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This City was built in the Year <HI>962.</HI> by Duke <HI>Henry. Otho</HI> inclo&s;ed it with Walls, in <HI>1157.</HI></NOTE> and that it is called <HI>Mo|nacum,</HI> or <HI>Monachium,</HI> becau&s;e there was a Mona&s;tery on the place where it is built. We al&s;o went to &s;ee in the Church of <HI>No|&s;tre Dame,</HI> the Tomb of the Emperor <HI>Louis</HI> IV. This Sepulchre is adorn'd with many fine Marble and Bra&s;s Figures. Having advan|ced Ten or Twelve Steps from the entrance of the great Door of this Church, you be|hold one of the Stones of the Pavement, on which is a double Cro&s;s; and it hath been ob&s;erv'd, that when you &s;tand up|right
<PB N="90" REF="64">
in this Place, the Pillars of the Church are &s;o placed, that you cannot &s;ee one of the Windows, though they are very many. All that come to Wor&s;hip in tho&s;e Chur|ches have a lighted Wax-Candle in their Hands; and that Candle is bigger or le&s;&s;er, according to the Quality of the Saint, or their Devotion.</P>

You mu&s;t not expect that I &s;hould give you an ample De&s;cription of a Place that is &s;o va&s;t, and &s;o full of Rarities. I tell you in general, that all &s;orts of Beauties and Ri|ches are found there in abundance. The great Hall of the Emperour's Apartment is One Hundred and Eighteen Foot in length, and Fifty Two Feet in breadth. We may ju&s;tly &s;ay, that it is in every re&s;pect Mag|nificent. All its Pictures are highly e&s;teem|ed: They are Hi&s;tories, the Sacred on one &s;ide, and the Prophane on the other; there are <HI>Latine</HI> Ver&s;es to every Hi&s;tory. I will

<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>The In&s;cri|ption over the Door runs thus:</HI> D. O.

But the Trea&s;ury infinitely exceeds all the re&s;t. There are many Ser|vices of Ve&s;&s;els of Gold, and many other precious Ve&s;&s;els. A prodigious quantity of great Pearls, Diamonds, Rubies, and other oriental Stones of exqui&s;ite Beauties; and an infinite number of excellent Pi|ctures, curious Works, Medals, and other Rarities. I cannot forget the Cherry-&s;tone,

upon which you may di&s;tinctly perceive the graving of One Hundred and Forty Heads; nor the Boat of Palm-Wood turn|ed into Stone, on which they have in&s;cri|bed the&s;e two Ver&s;es:

<L>Si non Neptunus navita Bacchus erit.</L></Q></P>
<P>Marble is to be found every where in this Palace, yet we mu&s;t not cheat our &s;elves; for they have the &s;ecret with a cer|tain Compo&s;ition to make it; which be|comes &s;o hard, and poli&s;hes &s;o well, that tho&s;e who are not very skilfull, take it for true Marble.</P>
<P>They have made divers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Walks under Ground.</NOTE> Galleries of Communication, which cro&s;s the Streets and Hou&s;es, by which they can go pri|vately from the Palace to all the Churches and Convents of the City.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFter we had for &s;ome time follow'd the Banks of the <HI>I&s;er,</HI> which is the River of <HI>Munich,</HI> we entred into a Fore&s;t; at our coming out of which, we &s;aw di|&s;tinctly the beginning of the <HI>Alps:</HI> Their Snowy tops are mingled with the Clouds, and re&s;emble very much the &s;welling and foaming Waves of a tempe&s;tuous and raging Sea. If the Courage of tho&s;e has been ad|mir'd, who fir&s;t expos'd them&s;elves to the Fury of that Element, here is matter e|nough of A&s;toni&s;hment, that any one
<PB N="94" REF="66">
&s;hould venture him&s;elf among the Cavities of &s;uch frightful Mountains.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Day we departed from <HI>Mu|nich,</HI> we came to a Village call'd <HI>Lagrem,</HI> which is at the Foot of the Mountains, and near to a little Lake of very fre&s;h Wa|ter; there they gave us Fi&s;h, who&s;e Names we knew not. The fir&s;t thing our Ho&s;t treat|ed us with, was a Chafing-Di&s;h full of In|cence, with which he perfum'd our Cham|bers; and truly we found more neatne&s;s in this little &s;olitary Habitation, than in many great Cities in our Journey. After we had coa&s;ted the Mountains about Two Hours, we entred there, and for a long time mounted among&s;t the Rocks, Firr-Trees, and Snow. Nothing is more wild and di&s;|mal than the&s;e places. Sometimes you find &s;ome Fi&s;her-men's Cottages, on the Banks of two or three Lakes, which are between the Mountains: But there is no &s;ign of any till'd Land; and probably a little Goat's Chee&s;e, with &s;ome Fi&s;h, is the principal Diet of the&s;e poor People. Their Cabins are made of the Roots of Firr-Trees, well joined together, and their Boats are fram'd of the &s;ame Trees hollow'd. They gave us Goats Fle&s;h, and great Salmon-Trouts in the Village of <HI>Mittenwald,</HI> which is Three Leagues farther. This Village is in the middle of a plea&s;ant Plain, and the Rocks which environ it are extraordinary high. Our Ho&s;t &s;hew'd us &s;ome Balls, or brown Ma&s;&s;es, about the bigne&s;s of a Hen's Egg, or le&s;s, which are a kind of &s;oft and im|perfect
<PB N="95" REF="66">
<HI>Bezoar,</HI> and are commonly found in tho&s;e Parts, in the Stomachs of the Goats. The good Man a&s;&s;ured us of their great Vir|tues, and that he often &s;old them to Travel|lers. He valued them at Ten Crowns a-piece; and I believe we &s;hould have done him a Courte&s;ie, if we had taken Five or Six which he had, at that price.</P>
<P>A little farther we met a very plea&s;ant Troop of Beggars; when they perceiv'd us at a good di&s;tance, one of them, who car|ried a Tree loaden with Red Fruits, plant|ed it in the middle of the Way, and &s;ate down by the &s;ide of it; a little Demi-Devil in the &s;hape of a Crocodile, fa&s;tened him&s;elf to the Tree, and a Girl with long and di&s;he|vel'd Hair, approach'd to it; an old Fellow cloath'd in Black, with a Peruke and Beard of Mo&s;s, &s;tood at a little di&s;tance, with a young Boy clad in White, who held a Sword. When they thought we were near enough, the little Divel open'd the Come|dy with a Balderda&s;h Song, and we could without difficulty Divine, that all was to re|pre&s;ent the Hi&s;tory of the Fall. One of us as he pa&s;&s;ed by the Old Man, ask'd him, &s;ince he kept at a di&s;tance from them, whe|ther he was of the Company; the poor Mortal an&s;wer'd coldly, That he was God the Father, and that if we would &s;tay a lit|tle, we &s;hould &s;ee him act his part, with his little Dagger-carrier, which was St. <HI>Michael</HI> the <HI>Arch-Angel.</HI> Behold the Product of the re|pre&s;entations which they make of the Deity!</P>
<P>A quarter of an Hour after this fine Ren|counter, we pa&s;s'd by the Fort of <HI>Chernitz,</HI>
<PB N="96" REF="67">
which is built between two inacce&s;&s;ible Rocks, and which &s;eparates the County of <HI>Tirol</HI> from the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Frei&s;inghen.</HI> This Bi&s;hoprick is in <HI>Bavaria;</HI> and <HI>Tirol</HI> is one of the Emperor's Hereditary Provinces. We came very late to the Village of <HI>Seefeld,</HI> after we had made many Turnings and Windings among the Mountains. There is a Convent of <HI>Augu&s;tines</HI> in this Village, and you may &s;ee in their Church two or three pretended Mi|racles, with which they make no &s;mall noi&s;e.</P>
<P>They tell of a certain Gentleman, na|med <HI>Mil&s;er,</HI> who lived at the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Schlosberg,</HI> about a quarter of a League from thence; and was very much dreaded in this Village, that he was &s;o vain as to de&s;ire to communicate with the great Ho&s;t, which is only for the u&s;e of the Clergy: They endeavour'd to per&s;wade him out of this Fancy, but all in vain. When they had put the Ho&s;t into his Mouth, it ca&s;t out, as they &s;ay, a Flood of Blood, and at the &s;ame time the Legs of the Communi|cant &s;unk into the Pavement up to the Knees: He would have &s;upported him&s;elf on the Altar, but the Stone gave way, and &s;oftned under his Hand, and the poor mi|&s;erable Man had been &s;wallow'd alive, if he had not been retriev'd by a &s;peedy Repentance. The <HI>Augu&s;tines</HI> &s;hew this pre|tended Ho&s;t, chewed, and bloody, in a Repo&s;itory of Gla&s;s. They &s;hew al&s;o the print of a Hand on one of the Stones of the Altar, and a Hole in the Pavement of the Church near the &s;ame Altar, as of two Legs &s;unk into &s;oft Ground. They &s;ay
<PB N="97" REF="67">
that this Ho&s;t worketh Miracles; and they find it not inconvenient to their Con|vent.</P>
<P>Two good Leagues on this &s;ide <HI>Seefeld,</HI> we began to de&s;cend, and three quarters of an Hour afterwards, we arriv'd in a deep Val|ley, which was at lea&s;t a Mile in breadth. The River <HI>Inn</HI> glides plea&s;antly along; and waters many not unhand&s;ome Villages. We turn'd to the left in this Valley, and fol|low'd always the Foot of the Mountain. And a little League farther, they made us ob&s;erve a &s;traight and cragged Rock, which they &s;aid was above an Hundred Fathom high, and was call'd <HI>The Emperor's Rock.</HI> About three quarters of the height of this Rock, there was a Nich dug,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> Stephen Pegius <HI>in his</HI> Hercules Pro|dicius.</NOTE> in which there was a Crucifix, and a Statue on each &s;ide of it. They &s;ay that <HI>Maximilian</HI> I. being in cha&s;e of a wild Goat, alighted ju&s;t at this place from the top of the Rock, which joins to the Mountains behind; and that the Emperour not daring to remount his Hor&s;e, was feign to have recour&s;e to Ma|chines to get down.</P>
<P><HI>In&s;pruck</HI> is but Two &s;hort Hours beyond the middle of the Valley,<NOTE PLACE="marg">INSPRUCK.</NOTE> upon the River <HI>Inn:</HI> You pa&s;s this River over a Bridge be|fore you enter the City; and it is therefore called <HI>In&s;pruck,</HI> that Word having the &s;ame &s;ignification in <HI>High-Dutch,</HI> as <HI>Aenipons,</HI> or <HI>Aenipontum</HI> in <HI>Latin.</HI></P>

tho&s;e who are not acquainted with them; for not only the Roofs are flat, but in&s;tead of the Rafters ri&s;ing to a Point, they are rever&s;ed, and the Rain falls into the middle of the Roof.</P>
<P>After the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> had the mi&s;|fortune to lo&s;e his E&s;tates, the Emperour gave him the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Tirol;</HI> and the Re&s;idence of this Prince was at <HI>In&s;pruck,</HI> in the Palace which was formerly the Arch-Duke's. This Palace hath many Conveni|encies, and is of a &s;ufficient extent, but it was built at &s;everal times, and hath neither Beauty nor Regularity.</P>
<P>They &s;how'd us here one thing &s;ingular, of which I will endeavour to give you the mo&s;t certain Account I could any way learn; though all my Indu&s;try to that pur|po&s;e &s;ignify'd but little. The Hou&s;e which they call the <HI>Chancery,</HI> is on the Place in the mid&s;t of the City. The Portrait of this Hou&s;e is like a little Porch without, to a Roof which is &s;upported by the Wall of the Hou&s;e; and they a&s;&s;ure us that this Roof is cover'd with Plates of Gold. This is what they told us of it. A Rebellion, and almo&s;t general Sedition being rais'd a|gain&s;t an Arch-Duke call'd <HI>Frederick,</HI> whom they particularize no otherwi&s;e; that Prince was forc'd to hide him&s;elf, but not being willing to go far off, that he might be ready to Act, in ca&s;e his Affairs &s;hould be in a bet|ter Po&s;ture; he engag'd him&s;elf, &s;ay they, to &s;erve a Miller in a Village of the neighbour|ing Mountain. In effect, the Troubles

<P>This Hi&s;tory contains nothing impo&s;&s;ible, and it was related to us for a certain Truth, by People who &s;eem'd to me Wi&s;e and Sen|&s;ible: neverthele&s;s, to &s;peak freely, I cannot but &s;u&s;pect it. I believe no Author ever writ of it, and &s;o &s;ingular a thing could not have been omitted. Perhaps &s;omething not un|like to this did really happen, which might give occa&s;ion to this Tradition.</P>
<P>I could not touch the Roof, becau&s;e it is a little too high, but I have attentively look'd upon it, and &s;aw di&s;tinctly that the Plates of Bra&s;s are placed on the Timber, and &s;erve for Tiles; and I perceiv'd al&s;o that each of the&s;e Plates is cover'd with another thin one of other Metal, which &s;eem'd to me to be about a Line in thick|ne&s;s. If the&s;e la&s;t Plates are not of Gold, I am &s;ure they are gilded; but if there be but a &s;imple Gilding, why Metal upon Metal? and why could they not al&s;o gild the Brazen Tiles?</P>
<P>The Roof may be about Fifteen Foot &s;quare; and if it be of Gold, I find by cal|culation that it co&s;t about Two hundred thou&s;and Crowns.</P>

They have taken a|way all the Furniture of ordinary u&s;e, but we found Galeries full of fine and very rare things. They led us pre&s;ently into a large Hall, where truly the Arms were more curious than u&s;eful. They made us take notice, among&s;t other things, of an extraordinary great and heavy Lance, which the Arch-Duke <HI>Ferdinand</HI> u&s;ed in Turnaments. They &s;aid that Prince<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The &s;ame is related of <HI>Lio|nardo du Vin|ci,</HI> a Painter of <HI>Florence.</HI></NOTE> could &s;top a Coach and Six Hor&s;es, by ta|king hold of a Spoak of the Wheel; and that he broke with his Hands, two Crown-Pieces joined together: and I know not how many other prodigious things, more difficult to be believ'd than the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Frederick.</HI></P>
<P>We went out of this Hall into a Galery, where were to be &s;een many Princes upon

their be&s;t Hor&s;es, with all their Armour, and all the Ornaments they u&s;ed in Turnaments.

<P>From this they brought us into another Galery, in which was a double Rank of great Cupboards, which were joined by the Backs and Sides, and which fill'd the mid|dle of the Galery, even to the top, &s;o that there was but a little room left to walk round. The Three fir&s;t Cupboards were full of Works of Alaba&s;ter, Gla&s;s, Coral, and Mo|ther of Pearl. In the Fourth were Medals and Money of Gold and Silver. The Fifth was garni&s;h'd with Ve&s;&s;els of Porcelane, and Seal'd Earth. In the Sixth were many little Cabinets very rich, of curious inlaid Works; the Boxes were fill'd with Medals, and little Works of <HI>Agat</HI> and <HI>Ambergree&s;e:</HI> There are Seven great Volumes cover'd with Black Velvet, with Plates and Cla&s;ps of Silver; and in&s;tead of Leaves they con|tain flat Boxes, which inclo&s;e a great num|ber

In the &s;eventh Cupboard are ancient or curious Arms: I I ob&s;erved a Cro&s;s-bow which included four and thirty Bows, and di&s;charged thirty four Arrows at a flight. The eighth is full of Animals, Plants, and other Productions of Nature. That which is e&s;teemed the greate&s;t Rarity, is the Horn of an Oxe, which is &s;ix Inches diameter. There are al&s;o Works of Wood, of Ivory, and of the Pen, in the three following Cupboards. The twelfth is filled with Manu&s;cripts, and curious Books. It would grieve one to pa&s;s this over &s;lightly, becau&s;e tho&s;e who &s;how it know not its worth. In the thirteenth are only works of Steel, and particularly my&s;terious Padlocks, and other Locks of curious Invention.

In the eighteenth are many &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els of diffe|rent Materials, and a very great number of the fine&s;t Shells in the World. The nine|teenth is the mo&s;t precious of all, it is full of Ve&s;&s;els of Gold, Chry&s;tal, Agat, Chal|cedony, Onyx, Cornelian, <HI>Lapis Lazuli,</HI> and other precious Stones, all of it inrich'd with Gold and Diamonds, in <HI>ba&s;&s;o releivo,</HI>

They &s;ay the la&s;t great Duke of <HI>Tu&s;cany</HI> would have given an hundred thou&s;and Crowns for it. Be&s;ides the Medals which I have told you of, and who&s;e number is infinitely great, there is above a great Mule's Load, that lie huddled together in a Che&s;t. When we parted from hence they brought us to the Library, which we found in very bad or|der, and our Guide could tell us nothing at all. From the Library we pa&s;&s;ed into a Galery, where there is a great number of Statues, Bu&s;ts, and other Pieces of Antiqui|ty, and we &s;aw afterwards a great many Chambers hung round with Pictures of great Price.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A Small League from <HI>In&s;pruck,</HI> we re|enter'd into the Mountains, and for &s;even hours together did nothing but a|&s;cend; this was the mo&s;t trouble&s;ome day's Journey we had all the way. A place &s;eemed to us to be among&s;t the Clouds, which a little while after we &s;aw below us. At length we came very late to a little Vil|lage, which is not yet at the top of the Mountain. It is called <HI>Gru&s;&s;e,</HI> that is, the <HI>Salutation;</HI> and it was &s;o named becau&s;e <HI>Charles</HI> V. and <HI>Ferdinand</HI> his Brother met in this place: you may find the Story about two hundred Paces from the Village, on a Marble Stone, which was plac'd exactly where the&s;e two illu&s;trious Brothers em|braced each other.</P>
<P>We had for Supper divers &s;orts of Wild-Fowl and Veni&s;on: almo&s;t all the Hares
<PB N="105" REF="71">
here, as well as the Foxes and Bears, are white; the Patridges are likewi&s;e &s;o for the mo&s;t part: there are a great many Heath-Hens, Phea&s;ants, and other great Fowl, which they call <HI>Schenhakn,</HI> or <HI>Cock</HI> of the Snow. All the&s;e &s;ort of Wild-Fowl have their Feet velvetted about the Claws, with a kind of Furr, which I cannot call either Hair or Feathers, but &s;o thick as the Snow cannot pierce it.</P>
<P>The Mountain is called <HI>Brennerberg,</HI> which &s;ignifies a fiery Hill; and the rea&s;on is, that be&s;ides the Thunders which are fre|quent in Summer, there are Winds &s;ome|times which pierce and burn. They force them&s;elves into the Throats or Pa&s;&s;ages of the Neighbouring Mountains, as into Pipes; and the&s;e various Torrents of the Air &s;hock one another &s;o impetuou&s;ly, that they pro|duce roaring and furious Hurricanes, which tear up both Trees and Rocks by the Roots. They &s;ay, that Travellers are &s;ometimes con&s;trained, to wait many days till the&s;e Storms are over. As for us, we left this unplea&s;ant Quarter the next day, and about two hours from thence, came to the highe&s;t acce&s;&s;ible part of this Mountain. There we &s;aw a thing very remarkable: It was a great Spring which falls upon a Rock, and &s;traightway &s;eparates it &s;elf into two Currents, which in a little time after be|came two con&s;iderable Rivers. The one turns to the <HI>South,</HI> and di&s;gorges it &s;elf into the <HI>Inn,</HI> near <HI>In&s;pruck.</HI> The other runs <HI>Northward,</HI> and after it hath pa&s;&s;ed <HI>Brixen</HI>
<PB N="106" REF="72">
and <HI>Bol&s;ane</HI> falls into the <HI>Adige,</HI> a little above <HI>Trent.</HI> We dined the &s;ame day at <HI>Steert|zingen,</HI> where they gave us Oy&s;ters of <HI>Venice,</HI> and &s;ome Fle&s;h of a certain Bea&s;t call'd <HI>Steinbokt,</HI> which is between a He-Goat and a Doe, and is mo&s;t delicate Food. At this Town we turned out of the direct way to <HI>Trent,</HI> becau&s;e it is dangerous, by rea&s;on of the Precipices, and took that of <HI>Brixen,</HI> which is not &s;o rough, and is the mo&s;t fre|quented.</P>
<P>This day we met more than an hundred Waggons which came from the Fair of <HI>Bol&s;ane;</HI> they were almo&s;t all drawn by Oxen. I ob&s;erved that the Cloven Feet of the&s;e Cattle were both parts &s;hod with Iron. The Pea&s;ants of the&s;e Mountains have little Carts with two Wheels, which they draw them&s;elves, and which they make u&s;e of to fetch Salt from <HI>Hall,</HI> which is a little City in the Valley of <HI>In&s;pruck.</HI> There are Salt-Pits there, the Water whereof being boiled, turns to Salt.</P>
<P>The Habits of the&s;e Mountaineers are the mo&s;t plea&s;ant in the World: Some of them have green, others yellow and blue Hats; and in &s;ome places it is difficult to know the Men from the Women. But as we change Countries, we may in all things ob&s;erve the variety which reigns in the World. We find not only new Languages and new Cu&s;toms, but al&s;o new Plants, new Fruits, new Cattle, and a new Face of the Earth. Almo&s;t quite throughout <HI>Tirol,</HI> the Sheep are black, in &s;ome places they
<PB N="107" REF="72">
are of a red tawny, and in others altogether white. There are &s;ome Provinces in which they have Horns; and others, where a horned Sheep would be look'd upon as a Mon&s;ter. We ob&s;erved al&s;o many diffe|rences in Bea&s;ts of the &s;ame kind: Nor are the Humours of Men without their Vari|eties. Not to leave the example of the Sheep; I know &s;ome Provinces, as that of <HI>Poitou,</HI> where the Milk of the&s;e Creatures is preferred before that of the Cows.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Montague</HI> &s;aith, the <HI>Tar|tars</HI> preferr Mares-Milk to all other Milk.</NOTE> In mo&s;t others they will not trouble them&s;elves to Milk them, &s;o little do they value their Milk. I once liv'd a con&s;iderable while in a Country, where, when a Sow Pigs, if there be any white ones they drown them, becau&s;e they believe, that all the white Pigs are Meazled. I have been al&s;o in a|nother Country, where the black Hogs were in le&s;s e&s;teem than others. In <HI>Nor|mandy</HI> the Milk of a black Cow is look'd on as a &s;pecifick Remedy; the Doctors pre|&s;cribe it for &s;uch, becau&s;e the black Cows are le&s;s common than the red. And in &s;ome places of your Country it is quite contrary, they mo&s;t highly e&s;teem the red Cows Milk; the cau&s;e is plain, becau&s;e the Cows are almo&s;t all black. Some can en|dure to look on nothing but what they are accu&s;tom'd to &s;ee; and others value nothing but what is rare and unknown. Cu&s;tom and Prejudice domineer over the World, and fanta&s;tical Humour reigns every where with them.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="73"><NOTE PLACE="marg">BRIXEN.</NOTE><HI>Brixen</HI> is yet in <HI>Tirol,</HI> it is a very little City, notwith&s;tanding it is a Bi&s;hoprick, and the Bi&s;hop re&s;ides in it. I cannot tell you the rea&s;on why the be&s;t Lodgings in this Country are always in the uppermo&s;t Story. It is true, that there you have le&s;s noi&s;e, but the trouble to get up to them is an inconvenience.</P>
<P>From <HI>Brixen</HI> to <HI>Bol&s;ane,</HI> which are but &s;even hours di&s;tant, we pa&s;s almo&s;t always between the River and the Mountains. Here the Rocks are &s;o high that they pierce the Clouds; and when the Snow meets, or a &s;udden Thaw comes, it occa&s;ions &s;uch a rowling of the&s;e Rocks as makes the way very dangerous: A Traveller is pent up there as in a &s;treight, or among&s;t many &s;treights, and has not room enough to go either forward or backward, without dan|ger, which is alike either way. The Ac|cidents which happen, and the Coaches which are overturned, often in the&s;e un|even ways, have occa&s;ioned the&s;e little Ora|tories with which the&s;e Ways are lined.

Tho&s;e who are in any kind of danger, implore either their Saint or their Relique, or their miraculous Image, If they are delivered they call their Pre&s;ervation a Miracle, and accompli&s;h their Vows. There have been already more than a Cart-load of Heads, Arms, and other Members of Silver, offered to our new Lady of <HI>Newbourgh.</HI> You may &s;ee great Churches all furni&s;hed and hung round with the like Monuments. They every day bring new ones, and the old give place to them, but you may be &s;ure no|thing is lo&s;t.</P>
<P>When we entred into the Valley of <HI>Bol|&s;ane,</HI> we were a&s;toni&s;hed to find the Air as &s;weet as could be imagined. The Vine|yards were all green, as well as the Willows, the Ro&s;es, the Mulberies, and a great num|ber of other Trees. A true Spring in the middle of Winter. This proceeds from its being &s;heltred from ill Winds, or from &s;ome other circum&s;tance of the Country.</P>
<P><HI>Bol&s;aner</HI> is in the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Trent;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">BOLSANE.</NOTE> it is a very little City, and its Fairs are all it can boa&s;t of. There are four in the Year, and each la&s;ts fifteen days; in which the Mer|chandizes of <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> are ex|changed. We ob&s;erved in the Roof of the Body of the great Church, a round Hole about three foot diameter; round about which is a kind of Garland, which is tied
<PB N="110" REF="75">
with Ribbons of &s;everal Colours, and on which I know not how many great Wafers hang. They told us, that on A&s;cen&s;ion-day, there was a kind of Opera in this Church, and that a Man which repre&s;ented <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> was lifted up to Heaven through this hole.</P>
<P>All the Valley of <HI>Bol&s;ane</HI> is full of Vine|yards, and the Vines are highly e&s;teem'd by the People of the Country; but Strangers are not plea&s;ed with them, becau&s;e of their &s;weeti&s;h Ta&s;te. It is but a good days Jour|ney between <HI>Bol&s;ane</HI> and <HI>Trent,</HI> through the Valley which is very fruitful and plea&s;ant. From place to place, near the Vines, are little Huts of Straw, which are &s;upported by three high Firr-Poles, placed like a Trevet; there they hide them&s;elves with a Carbine, in one of the&s;e little Ba|racques, and kill the Bears which come down from the Mountain to eat the Grapes.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">TRENT.</NOTE><HI>Trent</HI> is a little City, not much bigger than <HI>Bol&s;ane,</HI> and is almo&s;t &s;ituated after the &s;ame manner. It is founded on a flat Rock of a kind of white and reddi&s;h Marble, of which mo&s;t of the Hou&s;es are &s;olidly built. This City hath many times been laid wa&s;te, by the Inundations to which it is &s;ubject. The River often overflows, and the Brooks of <HI>Levis</HI> and <HI>Fer&s;ena,</HI> tumble &s;ometimes from the Mountains with &s;uch a terrible impetuo&s;ity, that they drive before them great Rocks, and rowl them even into the Town. <HI>Trent</HI> is begirt with a &s;ingle Wall,
<PB N="111" REF="75">
and the <HI>Adige</HI> runs by the &s;ide of it. They boa&s;t of the Bridge which is built over this River, without having any thing extraordi|nary to &s;how. They recommended to us the Bi&s;hop's Palace, as a great and &s;plendid Edi|fice; and I remember I have formerly heard the &s;ame things &s;aid of it: But the&s;e Re|ports created in us fal&s;e Notions of that Hou&s;e, which is low, and but of a very in|different &s;ize. The Bi&s;hop is a Temporal and Spiritual Lord in his Dioce&s;s, which is of a large extent. Some place it in <HI>Ita|ly,</HI> others make it part of <HI>Tirol:</HI> But the&s;e la&s;t deceive them&s;elves, if we may believe the People of the Country, for they &s;ay <HI>Trent</HI> is in <HI>Italy,</HI> though the Bi&s;hop be a Prince of the Empire; and the common Language of <HI>Trent</HI> is <HI>Italian.</HI></P>
<P>They &s;hew'd us in a Chapel of the Ca|thedral, the Crucifix <HI>under which the Synod was &s;worn, and promulg'd:</HI> It is as big as the Life, and, they &s;ay, it bowed its Head, to te&s;tifie the Approbation which it gave to the Decrees of that A&s;&s;embly. They add, That no Man ever knew what it was made of; &s;o that many doubt whether it were made with Hands. They are about to take it from the dark Place in which we &s;aw it, and place it in a magnificent Cha|pel, which will &s;hortly be fini&s;hed; where they expect it will do more Miracles than ever: It is call'd by way of Eminency, <HI>The Holy Crucifix.</HI> From thence we went to St. <HI>Mary Major,</HI> which yet is but a little Church. It is built of a kind of ba&s;e Mar|ble,

who&s;e Squares are only cut a little le&s;s; and it was in this place the Council &s;ate. The Organs of this Church are extraordi|narily great. They played to us many new Ayres, and counterfeited the Cries of a great many Animals: They beat a Drum, and did I know not how many other things, which have little relation to this place, or to the gravity of the Council, which is repre|&s;ented in a great Picture hard by.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rigord,</HI> Phy|&s;ician and Hi|&s;toriographer of <HI>Philip Augu|&s;tus,</HI> writes that in <HI>1180,</HI> the <HI>Jews</HI> of <HI>Paris</HI> tore by Whipping, and Crucified a Boy of <HI>12</HI> Years old, named <HI>Richard,</HI> the Son of a Citi|zen; that the Criminals were put to death; that all the <HI>Jews</HI> were driven out of the Kingdom, and young <HI>Richard</HI> was canonzied. <HI>R.

In a Word, the whole Villany was di&s;cover'd; the <HI>Jews</HI> were convicted, Thirty nine of them hang'd, and the re&s;t bani&s;h'd the City for ever. <HI>Sixtus</HI> IV. who was then Pope, being inform'd of the whole matter, thought fit to Canonize the Child, and gave it the name of <HI>Simonin,</HI> the diminitive of <HI>Simon,</HI> the Father's Name.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">ROVEREDO.</NOTE>WE pa&s;&s;ed thro' the little City of <HI>Rove|redo,</HI> where there is a great Trade of Silk. <HI>Bourguetto</HI> is not far off, which is the la&s;t Village of the <HI>Trentin,</HI> and <HI>O&s;&s;enigo</HI> the fir&s;t of the State of <HI>Venice;</HI> a little Cro&s;s of Wood makes the Separation between the&s;e two Sovereignties. A little on this &s;ide of <HI>Roveredo,</HI> we travers'd a Country all full of loo&s;e Rocks, &s;catter'd here and there, as if an Earthquake had thus &s;ow'd them from the Ruines of &s;ome Mountain: This is call'd the <HI>Wood of Roveredo,</HI> though there be not &s;o much as the Branch of a Tree in it. The Pa&s;&s;age is &s;ometimes dangerous, by rea&s;on of Thieves, as well as the Fore&s;t of <HI>Verg|nara,</HI> which is between <HI>O&s;&s;enigo,</HI> and the Fort of <HI>Guardara.</HI> Our Me&s;&s;enger advis'd us to take a Convoy in this la&s;t Pa&s;&s;age. When you are come into the States of <HI>Ve|nice,</HI> you find no more of tho&s;e Stoves, of which <HI>Germany</HI> is full; and you find a &s;en|&s;ible change in every thing.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">CHIUSA.</NOTE>We were con&s;train'd to lodge in a little Village call'd <HI>Seraino,</HI> becau&s;e it was too late to get to <HI>Sclu&s;e.</HI> That is a very con&s;i|derable Fort, who&s;e Situation is &s;omething like that of the <HI>Sclu&s;e</HI> which we met be|tween <HI>Geneve</HI> and <HI>Lyons,</HI> on the River <HI>Rho&s;ne;</HI> I fan&s;ie I have &s;een the De&s;cri|ption
<PB N="115" REF="77">
of it in your Clo&s;et. The fir&s;t is at the Foot of a high Rock; the way which leads to it is dug out of the craggy part of the &s;ame Rock; and on the other &s;ide is a Precipice, at the bottom whereof rowls the <HI>Adige.</HI> After we had pa&s;s'd this Fort, and had for &s;ome time follow'd the Banks of that River, which glides along among high Rocks, we found the Heaven open'd, and entred into a va&s;t Plain; whereas ever &s;ince our Departure from <HI>Munich,</HI> we had been enclos'd between the Mountains.</P>
<P>This Plain is &s;tony and barren in divers Places: There are in it &s;ome Olive-Trees, and White Mulberries for the Silk-Worms; the Vines ate planted at the foot of Cher|ry-Trees, and young Elms, and they join them&s;elves in Garlands from Tree to Tree. We pa&s;s'd the <HI>Adige</HI> in a Ferry-Boat, two good Leagues from <HI>Seraino;</HI> and a quarter of an Hour after,<NOTE PLACE="marg">VERONA.</NOTE> we plainly perceiv'd <HI>Ve|rona,</HI> where we arrived the &s;ame Day. By what we &s;aw at our entrance into it, we judg'd it to be but thinly Peopled. There are great void places on this &s;ide, and Gra&s;s growing in the Streets, and the great|e&s;t part of them not paved: It's true, the re&s;t of the City is not like this part; but putting all together, <HI>Verona</HI> looks like a poor place; and indeed there is but little Trade in it, and tho&s;e which live on their Rents make no great Figure. If there be &s;ome fine Buildings, it is certain that the Hou&s;es in general are very low and unequal. The greate&s;t part of the Balconies are of Wood,
<PB N="116" REF="78">
&s;o loaded with little Gardens in Pots and Ca&s;es, that it &s;eems dangerous to pa&s;s un|der them: The Streets are dirty, and al|mo&s;t all narrow. In a Word, This City is not at all fit to plea&s;e the Eyes of a Travel|ler. Neverthele&s;s it is very great, in a good Air, and its Situation is admirable. As it yields but little &s;atisfaction when you be|hold it near, and take a particular view of it; &s;o much the more will you admire it, when you look upon it from &s;ome eminency. We went up to the Ca&s;tle of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> which is on a ri&s;ing ground, within the Compa&s;s of the Walls, and we could not give over view|ing it from this Place; where we had a full pro&s;pect of it, and were charm'd to behold that admirable Garden of Plea&s;ure, in the mid&s;t of which it is &s;eated. The <HI>Adige</HI> cro&s;&s;es it, and Four fair Stone Bridges make the Communication between the two Parts, into which the River divides it. The Ca|&s;tle of St. <HI>Felix</HI> is behind that of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> and both together command the City. The other Fortifications of this place are much neglected, and very irregular.</P>
<P>The <HI>Amphitheatre</HI> of <HI>Verona</HI> is a thing &s;o much the more &s;urpri&s;ing, becau&s;e we do not frequently meet with &s;uch Monuments of antiquity.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The outward Wall or Front.</NOTE> The Inclo&s;ure is all de&s;troy'd, but they have taken care to repair the Benches, according as they fell to decay; there are Four and forty of them, and I counted Five hundred and thirty Paces in the highe&s;t round, and Two hundred and fifty on the lowe&s;t. Every Step is near a Foot and a

At every end of the <HI>Arena,</HI> between the Benches, there is a Portal of Twenty eight Foot high, by which the Entrance is to the <HI>Arena</HI> out of the Street; and a|bove every Portal a kind of Tribune or Platform of Twenty Foot long, and Ten broad, clo&s;ed before and on the &s;ides with a Balcony of Marble.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">Others at|tribute it to the Emperour <HI>Maximin.

<P>The Cathedral is a little dark Church. Pope <HI>Lucius</HI> III. is interr'd there; and they have written for an Epitaph on his Tomb-Stone, <HI>O&s;&s;a Lucii</HI> III. <HI>Rom&acirc; pul&s;us invidi&acirc;.</HI> I expected to have found another, which is more ingenious, which I remember I have read &s;omewhere:

<PB N="118" REF="79">
You know this Pope had great Broils with <HI>Frederick Barbaro&s;&s;a,</HI> as well as <HI>Alexander</HI> III. his Predece&s;&s;or. But the&s;e were not the only Cau&s;e of his leaving <HI>Rome:</HI> He was driven out by the Magi&s;trates, and by the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><L>Lucius e&s;t pi&s;cis rex, atque Tyrannus aquarum</L>

<P>It is &s;aid that <HI>Pepin</HI> the Son of <HI>Charle|main,</HI> and King of <HI>Italy,</HI> built the Church of St. <HI>Zeno</HI> at <HI>Verona.</HI> It mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd the Carvers of that time were mi&s;erable Ar|ti&s;ts. Never were there &s;een &s;uch wretch|ed Figures as the&s;e in the Front of this Church. I ob&s;erv'd in rhe Fronti&s;piece of the great Portal, two kind of Birds, which by their Combs &s;omewhat re&s;embled Cocks. They hold an Animal with a long Tail, be|tween them, which we &s;u&s;pected was de&s;ign'd to repre&s;ent a Fox; this poor Bea&s;t had his Feet tied together, and hung over a Pole, the ends of which were &s;upported by the Cocks. I cannot forbear &s;earching into the meaning of this little My&s;tery; and if you plea&s;e, I will adventure to tell you my Thoughts of it. The allu&s;ion of <HI>Gallus</HI> a Cock, to <HI>Gallus</HI> a <HI>French</HI>-man, is a thing &s;o familiar, that I fan&s;ie the two Cocks may &s;ignifie two <HI>French</HI>-men, and the Animal thus bound, mu&s;t be &s;ome crafty Fellow,
<PB N="119" REF="79">
cheated neverthele&s;s, and &s;upplanted by the Cocks. The <HI>Crane</HI> hath formerly been too hard for <HI>Renard.</HI> But to apply this Em|blem to &s;ome particular Event: Suppo&s;ing it to be true, that this Chuch was built under <HI>Pepin,</HI> as it &s;eems very probable, it may be conjectur'd, that his Father <HI>Charle|main</HI> and he were the two Cocks, and that the unfortunate <HI>Didier,</HI> the la&s;t King of the <HI>Lombards,</HI> was the Fox: You know <HI>Charlemain</HI> caus'd him&s;elf to be crown'd King of the <HI>Lombards,</HI> after he had di&s;po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed <HI>Didier,</HI> and <HI>Pepin</HI> was crown'd King of <HI>Italy</HI> &s;ome Years after: <HI>Didier</HI> then van|qui&s;h'd, &s;tripp'd, &s;haven, and put into a Convent; too nearly re&s;embles the Fox: Except you had rather it &s;hould be his Son, who&s;e Name, I think, was <HI>Adalgi&s;e;</HI> who in the end was taken and kill'd, af|ter he had vainly employ'd all his Wit and Force to regain the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Fa|ther's Dominions. I will not &s;ay that <HI>Pe|pin</HI> amus'd him&s;elf with &s;uch a Trifle, but it was perhaps the Fancy of the Carver. On the &s;ide of the &s;ame Portal they have put this fine Hieroglyphick. There is a Man on Hor&s;e-back in <HI>ba&s;&s;o relievo,</HI> over whom the&s;e Three Ver&s;es are written in Characters, half <HI>Roman,</HI> half <HI>Gothick:</HI>
<Q><L>O Regem &s;tultum, petit infernale tributum.</L>
<L>M&oacute;x&abque; paratur equus quem mi&s;it Daemon iniquus.</L>
<L>Exit aqu&acirc; nudus, petit infera not rediturus.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="80">Tho' I have given you &s;ome Conjectures concerning the Fox, I confe&s;s I can make nothing of this Divel's Hor&s;e; you may think of both as you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Returning from thence, we pa&s;s'd by the little Church of St. <HI>Mary the Old,</HI> near which are to be &s;een many magnificent Tombs of the <HI>Scaligers,</HI> who, as you know, were Princes of <HI>Verona,</HI> before that City belong'd to the Republick of <HI>Venice.</HI></P>
<P>The Rarities which we &s;aw in the Cabi|net of the Count <HI>Ma&s;cardo,</HI> de&s;erve that &s;ome learned Man &s;hould undertake their De&s;cription: And it may be cau&s;e of Admiration, that tho&s;e who have had the Curio&s;ity, and the Means to ama&s;s &s;o many fine things together, &s;hould not have had the care to procure Stamps of them, and to add Explanatory Remarks on &s;uch as are mo&s;t con&s;iderable; &s;carce any thing more remarkable can fall within the Ob&s;ervati|on of a Traveller, nor any thing that de|&s;erves better to be &s;tudied and de&s;crib'd. There you find a Gallery, and Six Cham|bers, all fill'd with the mo&s;t admira|ble Productions of Art or Nature. But as it is not po&s;&s;ible for me to give you a par|ticular Account of &s;o many things, &s;o will I not engage my &s;elf in &s;uch a Task, nei|ther at pre&s;ent, nor for the future: You need but call to mind all that you have alrea|dy &s;een in my Letters, and particularly that which I writ from <HI>In&s;pruck.</HI> Of Pictures, Books,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Roman Rods or Fa&s;ces.</NOTE> Rings, Animals, Plants, Metals, mon&s;trous or Extravagant Productions, and

Works of all Fa&s;hions; and, in a Word, all that can be imagin'd curious, or worth in|quiry, whether for Antiquity or Rarity, or for the Delicacy and Excellency of the Workman&s;hip; the Catalogue of them would alone amount to a Volume; only to &s;atisfie you in &s;ome mea&s;ure, I a&s;&s;ure you, that when-ever I &s;hall meet with any thing that I have not taken Notice of be|fore, and which &s;hall &s;eem worthy of par|ticular Ob&s;ervation, I &s;hall take care to communicate it to you.</P>
<P>There are here many<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The Ve&s;&s;els which they name are, <HI>en|clabria, pate|rae, prefericu|la, ollae &s;ym|pullae.</HI> Many &s;orts of Knives, <HI>dola|bra, cultri, &s;eva, &s;ece&s;pita.</HI> Axes, Mallets, Candle&s;ticks.</NOTE> In&s;truments and Uten&s;ils, which were u&s;ed in the <HI>Pagan</HI> Sacrifices.

<P>We &s;aw al&s;o many pieces of Workman|&s;hip, fram'd out of the Stone <HI>Amianthos,</HI> which is the <GAP DESC="foreign">, &s;o famous among the Natura|li&s;ts; this Stone, as hard and weighty as it is, is ea&s;ily divided into Fibres or Threads, which are &s;o &s;trong and flexible, that they may be &s;pun like Cotton. Before I leave this Head, I mu&s;t acquaint you with this Remark concerning the In&s;tances of Petrefaction, which I have ob&s;erv'd either here or el&s;e|where; that there is many times a great deal of Errour and Uncertainty in them, and that there are &s;everal Per&s;ons who &s;cru|ple not to u&s;e a little Artifice to multiply
<PB N="122" REF="81">
and diver&s;itie the Rarities with which they de&s;ign to fill a Cabinet. It cannot be de|ny'd that Nature &s;eems to divert her&s;elf &s;ometimes, with &s;uch fanta&s;tical Changes; but it mu&s;t al&s;o be confe&s;s'd, that they are often counterfeited by Art. I know not whether you ever &s;aw any of tho&s;e pre|tended Animals, call'd <HI>Ba&s;ilisks,</HI> which have a little re&s;emblance of a Dragon. The Invention is prettily contriv'd, and has cheated many; for they take a &s;mall <HI>Ray,</HI> and having turn'd it after a certain man|ner, and rais'd up the Fins in form of Wings, they fit a little Tongue to it, &s;ha|ped like a Dart, and add Claws and Eyes of Enammel, with other little Knacks, cu|riou&s;ly order'd; and this is the whole Se|crecy of making Ba&s;ilisks. I am not igno|rant that &s;ome Authors mention another &s;ort of Ba&s;ilisk, without either Feet or Wings, which they repre&s;ent like a crown'd Serpent, and many Naturali&s;ts affirm that it kills with its Breath and Looks. <HI>Galen</HI> takes notice of it as the mo&s;t Venemous of all Serpents, and tells us that the We|zel only fears not its Poi&s;on, but on the contrary, poi&s;ons it with its Breath. But I believe this Serpent is found only in the Land of <HI>Phoenixes</HI> and <HI>Uni|corns.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Curious may learn in <HI>Matthiolus</HI> how they make the Mandrakes.</NOTE>I might alledge to you many other lit|tle Cheats, like that of the fir&s;t Ba&s;ilisk; but to return to our Account of Petrefa|ction, I &s;hall fix only on one of all tho&s;e Ob&s;ervations that might be brought to Il|lu&s;trate

this Subject. There is a certain natural Production, according to &s;ome, a kind of imperfect Plant, or a Coralline Matter, which extreamly re&s;embles a Mu&s;h|room. I know not whether they do not &s;ome|times cheat them&s;elves, or are willing to cheat others. Be it as it will, this is that which they call <HI>Petrify'd Mu&s;hrooms,</HI> which indeed were never Mu&s;hrooms. The Que&s;tion de|pends on the matter of Fact; but one may yet &s;ay, that the little &s;olidity, and the little hardne&s;s of a Mu&s;hroom, makes it a thing the lea&s;t in the World Petrifiable, the Meta|morpho&s;is mu&s;t be done in a trice.</P>
<P>I remember I ob&s;erv'd in this Cabinet many of tho&s;e Barks of Trees, on which the Ancients wrote, before they knew the u&s;e of Paper; two Trees of black Coral, three Foot high each; a Hen's Egg

which was of this Figure; a Knife of Stone extreamly &s;harp, which &s;ome <HI>Jews</HI> made u&s;e of for the Circumci&s;ion of Children who died before the Eighth Day.

<P>We &s;aw a Burial lately, of which I mu&s;t give you &s;ome Account: The Body was dre&s;s'd in Black, with a White Linen Cloak, a fine Peruke, on the Head a Hat, and above that a Garland of Flowers. The Corps was laid on a Quilt, with a Counterpane of Flower'd Silk, Yellow and Red, and &s;upported with a Pillow of the &s;ame Stuff. Four Men carry'd it thus all open, and the Company follow'd Two and Two, of which only tho&s;e wore Garlands who were never Married. This was al&s;o the Cu&s;tom of the Ancients, and they call'd it <HI>Corona pudicitiae,</HI> The Crown of Cha&s;tity. Some Hours before, we had another Ren|counter: It was a Woman richly dre&s;s'd, who walk'd thro' the City between two Nuns, and was going to take the Habit. It is ordinary in this Country to go thus in publick, whereas in <HI>France,</HI> and many other places, this Ceremony is perform'd in the Convent.<NOTE PLACE="marg">M.

After he had vi&s;ited the I&s;lands of <HI>Cyprus, Rhodes, Candie, Malta,</HI> and <HI>Sicily,</HI> he pa&s;s'd over the Gulf of <HI>Venice,</HI> and &s;taid &s;ome days in the place where that famous City was &s;ince built: But the Air &s;eeming to him to be un|healthful, and the Pa&s;turage bad among the Salt and Mari&s;h I&s;les, <HI>Martin</HI> conti|nu'd his Voyage, and mounted the Ri|ver of <HI>Adige</HI> dry-&s;hod, and coming up to <HI>Ve|rona,</HI> he made choice of that for his la&s;t Re&s;idence.

<P>THE Country between <HI>Verona</HI> and <HI>Vi|cenza</HI> is fruitful, well manur'd, and al|mo&s;t every where level: The Trees are planted in Chequers, on which the Vines are rais'd, and &s;pread them&s;elves among the Branches; and the Ground is carefully till'd. We din'd at a little Village call'd <HI>La Torre,</HI> where are the Bounds between the <HI>Verone&s;e</HI> and <HI>Vicentin.</HI> The Wine of this Country is of &s;o faint a Sweetne&s;s, that it is noxious to
<PB N="127" REF="83">
the Stomach. Yet there are Wines at <HI>Verona</HI> that are much e&s;teem'd, and I think I have read in <HI>Suetonius,</HI> that <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> made them his ordinary Drink. The Bread is as if it were Earth, tho' very white and excellent Flower; it is becau&s;e they know not how to make it: Together with this, they treat|ed us with a Di&s;h of grey Pea&s;e, fried in Oil, and this was all our Fea&s;t. Is it not ve|ry &s;trange that we &s;hould be in danger to die of Hunger in a good Country, after we had fed plentifully among the Rocks and Mountains? The Soil is fat, and con&s;equently the Ways bad; in&s;o|much that at this Sea&s;on, there was need of Seven or Eight Hor&s;es to draw the Waggon-Coaches; they put them all to|gether under the Coachman's Whip, that he may drive them without a Po&s;tili|on.</P>
<P><HI>Vicenza</HI> is le&s;s by half than <HI>Verona,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">VICENZA.</NOTE> and is only encompa&s;s'd with tottering Walls. Three or Four little Rivers meet there, by which divers Commodities are im|ported, but none of them are Navigable. Our Guide carried us to &s;ome of the Churches: The <HI>Coronata</HI> is well paved and wain&s;cotted: That of the Religious of St. <HI>Catharines,</HI> hath Three fair Altars. There are &s;ome good Pictures in the Cathedral; and they &s;how us, likewi&s;e, in the Choir a Work of carv'd Stones, which the Sex|ton prais'd very much, tho' the matter be of little value; the Performance is better than the De&s;ign. The Town-Hou&s;e is

&s;urprized with their <HI>Palaces,</HI> nor their mo&s;t <HI>Sumptuous.</HI> I know not very well what the Word <HI>Palace</HI> &s;ignifies in your Tongue; but tho&s;e who are &s;omewhat ver&s;ed in our Language, ought to have no regard to the re&s;emblance of the Word <HI>Palais,</HI> to that of <HI>Palazzo,</HI> as if they &s;ignified the &s;ame thing. The Word <HI>Palais</HI> is not u&s;ed &s;o prodigally among&s;t us, as that of <HI>Palazzo</HI> is among&s;t the <HI>Italians;</HI> it imports a great deal more, and excites another <HI>Idea</HI> in the Hearer. In a Word, I find that they give the Name of <HI>Palazzi</HI> to an infinite Number of ordinary Hou&s;es, to which that of <HI>Palais</HI> does not at all belong. And to apply all that has been &s;aid to the lofty Palaces of <HI>Vicenza.</HI> I maintain in general, that they may be call'd hand&s;ome Hou&s;es, and no more. Perhaps there are Three or Four for which that Name might &s;eem too mean; but I cannot tell how they can be term'd <HI>very fine;</HI> for to &s;peak properly, they are but well-di&s;guis'd, not fine Hou&s;es: That is to &s;ay, there is nothing fair but the Fronti&s;piece, and that is no more than indifferent, for they are often built with Plai&s;ter in&s;tead of hewn Stone. I in&s;i&s;t the more on this, becau&s;e it is hard to root out the old Mi&s;take, with which many People are po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, about the multitude of Palaces in <HI>Italy;</HI> and I would endea|vour always to repre&s;ent things as they are.</P>
<P>Our Guide finding that we were no great Admirers of his Palaces, fan&s;i'd however,
<PB N="130" REF="85">
that he knew a way to &s;urprize us; and having in&s;en&s;ibly oblig'd us to follow him, he drew us on through the Dirt, a good half League from the City, to &s;hew us a little Country-Hou&s;e, which belonged to the Marque&s;s of <HI>Capra.</HI> It is a &s;quare Building, in the mid&s;t whereof is a little Hall, under a &s;mall Dome, and at each Angle of the &s;quare two Chambers and a Clo&s;et. There are &s;ome good Pictures in it; and the &s;ituation being on a little a&s;cent, contributes to render the place very agreeable.</P>
<P>Coming back from this Hou&s;e, he car|ry'd us to our Lady of <HI>Montheric.</HI> It is fa|mous in this Country, and the Prior told us the whole Story of it very &s;eriou&s;ly. You are to know only that this Image of our Lady came out of the Earth, in the very place where you &s;ee her: And that they have often in vain endeavoured to tran&s;port her to <HI>Vicenza;</HI> Ten thou&s;and Men together, as the Prior told us, were not able to carry her. The Picture by <HI>Paul</HI> of <HI>Verona,</HI> which is in their Dining-Room, is the be&s;t Piece in the Convent, it repre&s;ents St. <HI>Gregory</HI> at Table with &s;ome Pilgrims.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome Ruines of an ancient Amphitheatre at <HI>Vicenza,</HI> but they told us, they were almo&s;t all hid under new Buil|dings. The Theatre which is in the Aca|demy of the Olympicks, is of the famous <HI>Palladio.</HI> The Fabrick is none of the large&s;t, and they u&s;e it but on certain occa&s;ions, which rarely happen. The Triumphal-Arch,

which is without the Gates, at the entrance of the Plain, which is called the <HI>Field of Mars,</HI> is in imitation of the An|tick way of Building, by the &s;ame <HI>Palla|dio.</HI></P>
<P>The Garden of the Count of <HI>Valmanara,</HI> is a thing much boa&s;ted of in this City, and the In&s;cription which we read over the Garden-Gate, put us in great expectations. You have here the Contents of it:
<Q>Stop, dear Traveller, thou, who &s;earche&s;t for rare things, and enchanted places, for here thou may&s;t find &s;atisfaction. Enter into this deli|cious Garden, and ta&s;te abundantly of all &s;orts of Plea&s;ures: The Count of <HI>Valmanara</HI> gives thee leave, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
In effect, they once de&s;ign'd to have made this a very agreeable place. There is a Canal, Divi&s;ions or Knots, and Clo&s;ets; be|&s;ides an Alley of Citrons and Oranges, which is indeed a fine thing.</P>
<P>This Moun&s;ieur the Count puts me in mind of a plea&s;ant Story, which I have read in &s;everal Authors. They &s;ay that <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth being at <HI>Vicenza,</HI> a great number of Gentlemen and rich Burge&s;&s;es of that place, pre&s;&s;ed him very much to grant them the Title of Counts: <HI>Charles</HI> &s;till drew back, but in the end, to be rid of the&s;e trouble&s;ome People, &s;aid aloud, <HI>Well, well, I make you all Counts, both the City and Suburbs.</HI> From this time, &s;aith the Hi&s;tory,
<PB N="132" REF="86">
nothing is more common than the Counts of <HI>Vicenza.</HI></P>
<P>The way from <HI>Vicenza</HI> to <HI>Padua</HI> is not unlike to that between <HI>Verona</HI> and <HI>Vicenza.</HI> We pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Tezenza</HI> about three quarters of an hour from <HI>Vicenza,</HI> and the <HI>Brenta</HI> an hour from <HI>Padua.</HI> I know not whether the Antiquaries are agreed concerning this <HI>Brenta:</HI> Some pretend it was the <HI>Timavus,</HI> and others, that it is one of the <HI>Medoacus</HI>'s: The fir&s;t opinion &s;eems lea&s;t probable, be|cau&s;e of the River <HI>Timavus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bologna la gra&s;&s;a venetia la gua&s;ta, ma Padoa la Pa&s;&s;a.</NOTE> which pa&s;&s;eth by <HI>Friuli,</HI> and which is apparently the true one; but let us leave them to end their difference, and come to <HI>Padua.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Paduan</HI> is a level Country, and ex|treamly fruitful, yet <HI>Padua</HI> is a poor and ill-peopled City. The Circuit of it is great: but there are large places in it that are void of Buildings, and many Hou&s;es void of In|habitants.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>PADUA,</HI> called the Learned. This City was &s;ubjected to the <HI>Venetians,</HI> in the Year <HI>1406.</HI> In <HI>1519.</HI> they pulled down the Suburbs, in which were <HI>10</HI> Mona&s;teries, <HI>6</HI> Churches, <HI>7</HI> Ho&s;pitals, and about <HI>3000</HI> Hou&s;es. <HI>Schrad.</HI></NOTE> The ancient <HI>Padua</HI> hath &s;till re|tain'd its fir&s;t Walls; but &s;ince it fell into the hands of the <HI>Venetians,</HI> they have com|prized the Suburbs in the City, and com|pa&s;&s;ed it with a Fortification, which was never good, and is at pre&s;ent ready to fall.</P>
<P>There are Porches or Piazza's, almo&s;t throughout the whole City, which are very convenient to &s;helter People from Rain, but otherwi&s;e make the Streets narrow and dark, and give opportunity for tho&s;e fre|quent
<PB N="133" REF="86">
Robberies and Murders, which they call at <HI>Padua,</HI> the <HI>Qui va li?</HI> What can be more &s;trange, than that the Scholars of <HI>Padua,</HI> &s;hould be priviledg'd to knock down tho&s;e whom they meet, and to break Legs and Arms, without any hope of Ju&s;tice? For, as &s;oon as Night falls, they arm them|&s;elves, and going out in Companies, hide them&s;elves between the Pillars of the Porches; and while the poor Pa&s;&s;enger is &s;truck with terror at the hearing of the Que&s;tion, <HI>Qui va li?</HI> without perceiving who makes it; another at the &s;ame time cries, <HI>Qui va la?</HI> without giving a Man an opportunity to go forward or backward; the unhappy Creature mu&s;t peri&s;h between the <HI>Qui va li,</HI> and the <HI>Qui va la:</HI> of which the&s;e Sparks make but a Sport. This is what they call the <HI>Qui va li</HI> of <HI>Padua.</HI></P>
<P>It often happens that the&s;e Scholars kill unknown Per&s;ons, or &s;ome of them&s;elves, to maintain the privilege that they have a&s;&s;um'd. 'Tis true, the&s;e Indignities are not daily committed, for People keep them&s;elves as clo&s;e as they can out of harms way. But it may be &s;aid, without exaggeration, that not a Month pa&s;&s;eth, in which two or three Mi&s;chances do not happen. Not but that this unbridled Licence might be ea&s;ily re&s;train'd; but <HI>Venice,</HI> which in&s;i&s;ts on the finene&s;s of her Politicks, and pu&s;hes them to the utmo&s;t, would have this Scourge for the <HI>Paduans,</HI> and this Petrolle which co&s;ts nothing. I will tell you the re&s;t another time.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="87">I had ye&s;terday a long di&s;cour&s;e with &s;ome Per&s;ons, who believe that <HI>Padua</HI> was formerly a Sea-Port, both becau&s;e the An|cients &s;peak of it, as a very rich Place, and becau&s;e when they dig Wells or Foundations of Hou&s;es, they find in divers places Anchors and Ma&s;ts. I know not if this Opinion may &s;eem rea&s;onable to you; but &s;ince Hi&s;tory hath given us no account of it, I &s;hould rather have recour&s;e to a more ea&s;ie way, to explain how Ve&s;&s;els come up to <HI>Padua,</HI> which is, that there was formerly &s;ome great Canal.</P>
<P>They affirm al&s;o, that <HI>Padua</HI> was built by <HI>Antenor,</HI> and they &s;how there a great repo&s;itory for Bones, in which they have placed the pretended Bones of this old <HI>Trojan,</HI> and it is commonly called <HI>Antenor</HI>'s Tomb.

<P>As for the Tomb it is a meer Bauble. It is about four hundred and odd Years, that they were working on the Foundations of an Ho&s;pital, and dug up a Leaden-Coffin, near which they found a Sword. The
<PB N="135" REF="87">
Coffin had no In&s;cription, and upon the Sword were &s;ome <HI>Leonin</HI> Ver&s;es of barba|rous <HI>Latin.</HI> Judge, I pray you, whether this may not as well agree with the <HI>Trojan</HI> Hor&s;e as <HI>Antenor.</HI> In the mean time the immoderate love which &s;ome People have for every thing that bears the Stamp of An|tiquity, has made &s;ome Per&s;ons dream, that they had found the Tomb of <HI>Antenor.</HI> A certain Man called <HI>Lupatus,</HI> who was then Magi&s;trate, and a Man of &s;ome Learning, had al&s;o his Rea&s;ons or Prejudices in favour of the&s;e Bones: And he it was, who &s;ome Years after, put them in that renowned Tomb, which they call at this day the Tomb of <HI>Antenor,</HI> and which is to be &s;een at the entrance of St. <HI>Laurence</HI>'s-&s;treet. He cau&s;ed four Ver&s;es to be Engraved on it, and which, as you may believe are in <HI>Gothick</HI> Characters:

There are &s;ome who read, <HI>Patriae vox,</HI> and others, <HI>Patriam.</HI> But they are both in the wrong, for the <HI>ae</HI> of the word <HI>Patriae</HI> is plain; and if one would joyn the <HI>m,</HI> which follows with <HI>Patriae,</HI> it mu&s;t be read <HI>Pa|triaem.</HI> This <HI>m</HI> is nearer to <HI>vox</HI> than <HI>Patriae,</HI> nor can it be doubted to be an <HI>m,</HI> becau&s;e the &s;ame Character is found in divers words which follow.

<P>From this Church we went to that of St. <HI>Ju&s;tina,</HI> which is very great and beau|tiful, though it be far from the Per|fection to which they de&s;ign to advance it.

When the noi&s;e of this di&s;|covery was &s;pread abroad, all the City run thither, with tran&s;ports of an inexpre&s;&s;ible Joy and Zeal.

In fine, <HI>Titus Livius,</HI> after he had been robb'd of his Jaws by a People greedy of Relicks, was put into a Coffin of
<PB N="140" REF="90">
Wood, that he might more ea&s;ily be carried. They loaded it with Branches of Laurel, and the be&s;t of the City carried it in Tri|umph to the Palace of Ju&s;tice; in which place, after many Deliberations and Cere|monies, they erected the Monument which is now to be &s;een, and to which they after|ward added this In&s;cription, which was found in the Neighbourhood of the place where the Temple of Concord formerly &s;tood.</P>

<P>When the Marchione&s;s was &s;urprized in her Bed, her only Son, about five Years old was with her; but the Murtherer ha|ving carried him into a Neighbouring Cham|ber, before he perpetrated his horrid Vil|lany, the Child could not &s;ee all that pa&s;|&s;ed.

The Child gave &s;ome Information; &s;ome Neigh|bours affirm'd, they had &s;een the Gentle|man in that Quarter: They found a Button of his Sleeve on the Bed, fellow to that which he &s;till wore; and the&s;e things were &s;trong Arguments of his Guilt. They put him to the Torture, both ordinary and ex|traordinary, but he &s;till denied the Fact; and after fifteen Years Impri&s;onment, his Friends wrought &s;o hard, that they &s;aved him, and even, as I &s;uppo&s;e, obtained his Liberty; which yet he enjoyed not long, for &s;ome Months after his Deliverance, the young Marque&s;s, which was the Child I &s;poke of, &s;hot him with a Pi&s;tol in the Head, and &s;o revenged the Death of his Mother.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT was an extraordinary &s;atisfaction to me to meet with your Letters in this place; be&s;ides the plea&s;ure I had to learn
<PB N="144" REF="92">
good news of you; you have done me a &s;ingular kindne&s;s, in propo&s;ing Que&s;tions to me, about tho&s;e things concerning which you de&s;ire to be mo&s;t particularly inform'd. A&s;&s;ure your &s;elf, Sir, my be&s;t endeavours &s;hall not be wanting to an&s;wer your Demands exactly: I entreat you to continue the &s;ame Method hereafter, that I may be better enabl'd to &s;end you &s;uch Accounts as may be acceptable to your &s;elf, and tho&s;e of our Friends, to whom you communicate them.</P>
<P>You de&s;ire me to tell you &s;incerely, whe|ther our pre&s;ent Travels be really plea&s;ant to us, or at lea&s;t whether the plea&s;ure we take in them be not over-balanced by the trouble which they give us. I am not at all &s;urpri&s;ed that you &s;hould entertain &s;uch a doubt of it; for though we are not a|mong Wild Bears, or in the De&s;arts of <HI>Arabia,</HI> yet are we not without &s;ome diffi|culties. The Weather is very rough; the way of Travelling ordinarily unplea&s;ant, and the days &s;o &s;hort, that we get late in at Night, and ri&s;e very early: We oftentimes meet with hard Lodging, and wor&s;e Diet; and be&s;ides, we are expo&s;ed to many dan|gers. Neverthele&s;s, with a good Stock of Health, Money, Chearfulne&s;s and Patience, we have &s;urmounted the&s;e difficulties, even almo&s;t without taking notice of them. Cu&s;tom makes all things ea&s;ie, and is a &s;o|vereign and univer&s;al Remedy. We take &s;ome days of re&s;t when we think we want it: The variety and perpetual Novelty of
<PB N="145" REF="92">
Objects recreates the Spirits as well as the Eyes. A little wearine&s;s &s;upplies the want of a Bed, and Exerci&s;e &s;harpens our Ap|petites. <HI>Offa &amp; torus herbaceus, famis &amp; la|boris dulci&s;&s;imae medullae &s;unt.</HI> With good Furrs we defended our &s;elves again&s;t the Cold, in &s;pite of all the Fro&s;ts and Snows of the <HI>Alps:</HI> In fine, without alledging tho&s;e general Rea&s;ons, which render Tra|vels profitable and plea&s;ant, I will po&s;itively tell you, that the tendere&s;t and mo&s;t deli|cate Per&s;ons of our Company, have ea&s;ily overcome all tho&s;e Ob&s;tacles, which might hinder the &s;atisfaction which we expected. Our &s;tay at <HI>Venice</HI> will perfectly recruit us, and when we &s;hall proceed on our Travels, the &s;weetne&s;s of the Spring will in&s;en&s;ibly begin to &s;ucceed the rigours of the Win|ter.</P>
<P>As to the re&s;t, I have let a whole Month pa&s;s without writing to you, &s;ince we arrived in this City, that I might more cer|tainly inform my &s;elf of the things with which I intend to entertain you. I will tell you nothing but what I have &s;een my &s;elf, or of which I have had particular Information. You are in the right to con|clude, that I will not undertake to give you a de&s;cription of <HI>Venice;</HI> that would be a work too tedious, and foreign to my de|&s;ign. Yet I will not affect to tell you only &s;uch new and &s;ingular things as were never mention'd by any other. Being willing to be ignorant what others have written; I will &s;peak as an Eye-witne&s;s, and repre&s;ent
<PB N="146" REF="93">
to you, as naturally as I can, the principal part of &s;uch things as I &s;hall judge worthy of ob&s;ervation, without giving any heed to what others have &s;aid. You will per|ceive, that I take care throughout to an&s;wer your particular Que&s;tions: If you have forgotten any thing, you may acquaint me with it in your next Letters. <HI>Venice</HI> is &s;o &s;ingular a place, look on it which way you plea&s;e, that I have propo&s;ed to my &s;elf to con&s;ider it with care: I have filled all my Memorials; and I hope I &s;hall be able to give a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer to mo&s;t of your Que&s;tions. But I mu&s;t adverti&s;e you of two things, before I put an end to this little Preface. The fir&s;t is, that I re&s;erve &s;ome of the mo&s;t notable Ob&s;ervations, to be com|municated to you on &s;ome other occa&s;ion. The other is, that I will not oblige my &s;elf to any order in my Ob&s;ervations, but re|late things as I chanc'd to meet with them, as I have already intimated to you in ano|ther place.</P>
<P>We parted from <HI>Padua</HI> on the twentieth of the la&s;t Month, and came hither betimes that Evening: There are many good Vil|lages on the way, and a great many Hou&s;es of Plea&s;ure, which belong to noble <HI>Vene|tians,</HI> and were built by <HI>Palladio.</HI> The <HI>Ausbourg</HI>-Po&s;t brought us to <HI>Me&s;tr&eacute;,</HI> which is a little City on the Bank of the <HI>Gulf,</HI> Five Miles from <HI>Venice.</HI> I have read &s;ome|where in <HI>Mezeray</HI>'s Hi&s;tory, that the <HI>Adriatick</HI>-Sea was frozen in the Year<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Others &s;ay in <HI>859.</HI></NOTE> 860, and that they went in a Coach from the
<PB N="147" REF="93">
main Land to <HI>Venice.</HI> As for us, we were oblig'd to take <HI>Gondola's</HI> at <HI>Me&s;tr&eacute;,</HI> and were about an Hour and an half on the Water.</P>
<P>That I may give you a true <HI>Idea</HI> of <HI>Ve|nice,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>VENICE,</HI> call'd the Rich.</NOTE> I mu&s;t in the fir&s;t place de&s;cribe tho&s;e Waters in the mid&s;t of which it is &s;eated. The general Opinion of Geographers is, That <HI>Venice</HI> is built in the Sea, and this in &s;ome mea&s;ure is true; neverthele&s;s it re|quires Explication: It is certain it is not the Main Sea, but drown'd Lands, yet &s;uch as were drown'd before the Building of <HI>Venice;</HI> that is, at the lea&s;t Thirteen or Fourteen Hundred Years ago. The great|e&s;t Ve&s;&s;els float in &s;ome places on tho&s;e Waters, and there are Chanels by which tho&s;e that are of no greater Burden than Two Hundred Tuns, can go up to <HI>Venice</HI> it &s;elf. The Sea there hath a free Com|munication with the Main Sea, by the Ebbing and Flowing Tides. The Oy&s;ters and other Shell-Fi&s;h &s;tick to the Foundati|ons of the Hou&s;es of <HI>Venice</HI> and <HI>Murano,</HI> as they do in other places to the Rocks; &s;o that I think it may be truly &s;aid, that <HI>Venice</HI> is in the Sea. Yet &s;ince 'tis plain that this drown'd Country was formerly a Mari&s;h; the&s;e Waters have but very little depth, and after all, this is not the true and ancient Sea: This Extent of Water is at <HI>Venice</HI> call'd only the Lake or Mari&s;h, and they gave it the Name of <HI>Lacuna;</HI> I ob&s;erve that the greate&s;t part of Strangers adopt this Word, every one di&s;gui&s;ing
<PB N="148" REF="94">
it according to his own Language, for want of a fit term to expre&s;s it. <HI>Lacune</HI> hath another &s;ignification in <HI>French,</HI> which perhaps is the rea&s;on that they change here the C into G and call it <HI>Lagune.</HI> Tho' this be a barba|rous Word, and newly invented, yet I am re&s;olv'd to make u&s;e of it, &s;uch as it is, rather than give my &s;elf the trouble to frame a better.</P>
<P>They have Mills, and other Machines, to empty the Mud and Ou&s;e, which ga|ther continually, and di&s;cover them&s;elves in &s;everal places, when the Sea is at the lowe&s;t Ebb: They have turn'd the Mouth of the <HI>Brent,</HI> and &s;ome other Rivers, to prevent their throwing of Mud and Sand into the <HI>Lagunes;</HI> and that the Earth may not regain from the Sea, which would be very prejudicial to <HI>Venice,</HI> who&s;e Strength and Security con&s;i&s;ts in its Situation. It is true, that if this City is oblig'd to labour ince&s;&s;antly, to keep the Waters which en|viron it at a certain depth, to prevent its being re-united to the Continent; &s;o it would not be for its advantage in every re|&s;pect, that the&s;e Waters &s;hould have a great and general depth; becau&s;e while things remain in or near the &s;ame Po&s;ture they are now in, it, is, in a manner, impo&s;&s;ible to approach to <HI>Venice,</HI> either by Sea or Land. When <HI>Pepin,</HI> of whom we &s;pake not long &s;ince, undertook to expel the Doge <HI>Mau|rice,</HI> and his Son <HI>John,</HI> who was his A&s;&s;o|ciate. He parted from <HI>Ravenna</HI> with his Fleet, imagining with full Sails, to pa&s;s
<PB N="149" REF="94">
every-where. But whil&s;t the Doge's Ships &s;teer'd their Cour&s;e through the navigable Chanels, without meeting with any Mi&s;|fortunes, <HI>Pepin</HI>'s Ve&s;&s;els &s;tuck, and &s;unk in the Mud on all &s;ides; &s;o that after a great lo&s;s, he was con&s;train'd to fly with the Re|mainders of his wreck'd Fleet. It is mani|fe&s;t, that could this Fleet have pa&s;&s;ed eve|ry where with full Sails, this Expedition had &s;ucceeded better. It is about Three hundred and odd Years &s;ince the <HI>Genoe&s;es</HI> receiv'd the like treatment.</P>
<P>I believe you do by this time &s;ufficient|ly comprehend what is meant by the&s;e <HI>La|gunes</HI> of <HI>Venice:</HI> Repre&s;ent then al&s;o to your &s;elf the City of <HI>Venice,</HI> which ri&s;es out of the mid&s;t of the&s;e Waters, with Thirty or Forty large Steeples, and is at lea&s;t a League and an a half di&s;tant from the Land. It is certainly a very &s;urpri&s;ing Object to &s;ee this great City without any Walls, or Ramparts, to be beaten on every &s;ide with the Waves, and yet to remain on its Piles as firm as on a Rock.</P>
<P>I know very well that all Geographers have written, that <HI>Venice</HI> is compos'd of Seventy two I&s;les; I will not controvert &s;o generally receiv'd an Opinion: But I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that I can by no means conceive what the&s;e I&s;les &s;hould be; and I dare a&s;|&s;ure you, that this Account gives a fal&s;e Notion of the Platform and Situation of this City. It would &s;eem by this De&s;cri|ption, that there were Seventy two little Hills, one near the other, and that the&s;e
<PB N="150" REF="95">
little Eminencies being all inhabited, had at la&s;t form'd the City of <HI>Venice,</HI> which is not at all probable. <HI>Venice</HI> is all flat, and built on Piles in the Water. The Water wa&s;hes the Foundations of almo&s;t all the Hou&s;es, to the height of Four or Five Feet, and the Canals are always of equal breadth. 'Tis true, they have made the be&s;t u&s;e of &s;everal &s;paces, of a rea&s;onable bigne&s;s, which may, indeed, give occa&s;ion to be|lieve, that there was formerly &s;ome Land there, but not Seventy two I&s;les.</P>
<P>For the Streets, they are very narrow, and &s;eem to have been fill'd and rais'd with Mud and Rubbi&s;h; for it is not at all probable that they have natural Founda|tions; and be&s;ides, if all the Divi&s;ions which the Canals make, were reckon'd for I&s;les, we &s;hould find near Two hundred in&s;tead of Seventy two. It might be far|ther ob&s;erv'd, that the number of the&s;e I&s;les might be infinitely increas'd, and new ones made in any place, by fixing Poles, and building Hou&s;es upon them. There are Eighteen, or Twenty &s;uch like I&s;lands &s;catter'd up and down in the <HI>Lagunes,</HI> without counting <HI>Pale&s;trina, Ma|malocco,</HI> and Eight or Ten others, which con&s;i&s;t of &s;olid Earth, and are truly I&s;les.</P>
<P>We are not to take notice of what is commonly &s;aid of the greatne&s;s of <HI>Venice;</HI> &s;ome give it Eight Miles circuit, others allow but Seven. As for me, I a&s;&s;ure you <HI>Venice</HI> is neither Eight nor Seven Miles in
<PB N="151" REF="95">
compa&s;s. They reckon Five Miles from <HI>Me&s;tr&eacute;</HI> to <HI>Venice,</HI> which way we came in an Hour and an half, with Two Rowers; and we &s;ail'd round <HI>Venice</HI> in the &s;ame &s;pace of time, with Two other Rowers, who made neither more nor le&s;s ha&s;te than tho&s;e of <HI>Me&s;tr&eacute;.</HI> Judge then by this, of the Circuit of that City: Con&s;ider too, that our <HI>Gondola,</HI> was many times obliged to fetch a Compa&s;s, to avoid the little Capes which the City makes in &s;everal places, and by con&s;equence the Line that it made was greater than the true Circuit of the City. Be&s;ides, to mark the Circumference of a City, without con&s;idering its Figure, is not a competent way to determine the largene&s;s of its Content.<NOTE PLACE="marg">This is what made <HI>Polybi|us</HI> &s;ay, That <HI>Sparta,</HI> which had but Forty eight <HI>Stades</HI> in compa&s;s, was twice as big as <HI>Megalopolis,</HI> which had Fifty. [A <HI>Stade</HI> contain'd <HI>125</HI> Geometri|cal Paces.]</NOTE> A very indiffe|rent Mathematician may demon&s;trate clear|ly, that a City which is near Eight Miles in compa&s;s, for Example, may contain a le&s;s number of Hou&s;es, than another City which is only Four Miles, or le&s;s if you plea&s;e. This depends upon the regularity or irregularity of the Figure. This Truth, which is undeniable, is the rea&s;on that I never will never pretend to repre&s;ent the bigne&s;s of Cities by the mea&s;ure of their Circuit, for that might betray you into ve|ry con&s;iderable Errors. I &s;hall ordinarily content my &s;elf with telling you, that a City is Great, or very Great; Little, or very Little: And I am per&s;uaded that &s;uch Expre&s;&s;ions as the&s;e, may give you a &s;uffi|cient <HI>Idea</HI> of its Greatne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="96">The number of Inhabitants is another thing which is ha&s;tily determined, but &s;el|dom well examin'd. It is commonly re|ported at <HI>Venice,</HI> that there are Two or three hundred thou&s;and Souls in the City, and &s;ome have advanc'd the number to Four hundred thou&s;and; but we mu&s;t not rely upon the&s;e Computations. When the Trade of <HI>Venice</HI> flouri&s;h'd, 'tis probable that the number of its Inhabitants was much greater than it is at pre&s;ent: But if we may give credit to the Report of a Per&s;on who hath been &s;ettled here for a long time, and a&s;&s;ur'd me, that his Calculation is very exact; <HI>Venice</HI> doth not at pre&s;ent contain more than an Hundred and forty thou|&s;and Souls, comprehending therein the I&s;le of <HI>Giudeca.</HI></P>
<P>Tho&s;e who plea&s;e them&s;elves to repre&s;ent <HI>Venice</HI> as a very populous City, take great care to inculcate, that it hath neither Gar|dens, nor void Places, nor Church-yards, and that the Streets are very Narrow: But when, on the other hand, they would de&s;cribe the Beauty of <HI>Venice,</HI> they mag|nifie its Gardens, its Places, and the breadth and number of its Canals. I read the other Day in a <HI>Venetian</HI> Author, that he counted in <HI>Venice</HI> Fifty three Publick Places, and Three hundred and thirty five Gardens. Thus you may &s;ee how variou|&s;ly things are pre&s;ented. But to &s;peak the Truth, there is both Truth and Fal&s;hood in either of the&s;e Reports; I will not di|&s;pute but that there may be Fifty three
<PB N="153" REF="96">
Spaces, great and &s;mall, to which this Au|thor hath thought fit to give the name of <HI>Places;</HI> and the &s;ame may be &s;aid of his Gar|dens. But if we con&s;ider the&s;e <HI>Places</HI> and <HI>Gardens</HI> particularly, we mu&s;t conclude him too prodigal of his honourable Titles. To &s;peak properly, there is but one <HI>Place</HI> at <HI>Ve|nice,</HI> the famous and magnificent <HI>Place</HI> of St. <HI>Mark.</HI> But let us allow him the liber|ty to be&s;tow that Name on Five or Six void Spaces more, which have &s;ome &s;mall Extent; yet all this comes far &s;hort of Fifty three <HI>Places.</HI> There are al&s;o &s;ome Gardens here and there, particularly on the &s;ide of <HI>Santa Maria del' Orto;</HI> but if we &s;et a&s;ide Fifteen or Twenty, or &s;hould allow Thirty, or Thirty five, to de&s;erve to be &s;o call'd, I can po&s;itively averr, that the Three hundred which remain, would not, one with another, be Ten Foot &s;quare; and are not the&s;e very noble Gardens? Nor is the other Account exactly true; for be&s;ides that <HI>Venice</HI> may have Gardens and void Spaces, there are many parts of it very &s;lenderly inhabited. It is true, in|deed, there are no Church-yards: And as for the Argument that is brought from the narrowne&s;s of the Streets, it is a petty Sophi&s;m, that may be ea&s;ily refuted, by &s;aying, that it is nothing but a bare A&s;&s;er|tion. The Streets are &s;treight and narrow, I confe&s;s, and &s;o narrow, that the jo&s;tling of Elbows in the mo&s;t frequented Places, is a great inconvenience; but I am of O|pinion, that the Canals ought to be rec|koned
<PB N="154" REF="97">
in&s;tead of Streets; and if the Ca|nals were fill'd and pav'd, there would be no rea&s;on to complain of narrow Streets in <HI>Venice.</HI></P>
<P>But I mu&s;t tell you, &s;ince we are on this Subject, that all the City is &s;o mangled with the&s;e Canals and Streets, that there are almo&s;t no Hou&s;es but what you may go to by Water as well as by Land. Not that every Canal is border'd with a double Quay, as in <HI>Holland,</HI> for the conveniency of tho&s;e who go on Foot: There are, in|deed, &s;ome of the&s;e; but very often the Canal occupies all the Space from one Range of Buildings to another. The Streets are in the little I&s;les that are form'd by the Canals; &s;o that there is not any part of the City, to which one may not go either with or without a <HI>Gondola.</HI> 'Tis true, all the&s;e little Pa&s;&s;ages, and all the Turns that mu&s;t be made to find the Bridges, do make <HI>Ve|nice</HI> a true Labyrinth.</P>
<P>The famous Place of St. <HI>Mark</HI> was the fir&s;t Place which our Curio&s;ity prompted us to vi&s;it, after our Arrival at <HI>Venice;</HI> and it is really the Soul and Glory of that City. The Church of St. <HI>Mark</HI> fronts one of the Ends of this Place, and that of St. <HI>Geminian</HI> the other; and the <HI>Procuraties</HI> or Lawyer's Offices and Lodgings, which are built with Marble, and are both very fine and regular, border the two &s;ides of it with great Piazza's; which much en|large the <HI>Place,</HI> and at the &s;ame time con|tribute to its convenience. This <HI>Place</HI> is
<PB N="155" REF="97">
Two hundred and four&s;core Foot long, and One hundred and ten broad. When you come from the Church of St. <HI>Gemi|nian</HI> towards that of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> and in|&s;tead of entring there, turn to the Right|hand; the <HI>Place</HI> turns al&s;o in form of a Square; and this Second <HI>Place,</HI> who&s;e ex|tremity reaches to the Sea, is Two hun|dred and fifty Paces long, and Four&s;core broad: This is that which they call the <HI>Broglio.</HI> The Palace of the Doge is on one &s;ide of it, and the <HI>Procuraties</HI> are continu|ed on the other. All this con&s;ider'd toge|ther, makes an admirable Show, and may pa&s;s for a mo&s;t magnificent <HI>Place.</HI></P>
<P>The Tower of St. <HI>Mark</HI> is near the An|gle of the Square within, and does in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;poil the Symmetry of the place: This Tower is Three hundred and &s;ixty Foot high, comprehending the An|gel, which &s;erves for the Weather-Cock. It was formerly all over gilt, and when the Sun &s;hined upon it, tho&s;e at Sea might perceive it at Thirty Miles di&s;tance; but now the Gold being gone, it &s;carcely ap|pears. You a&s;cend this Tower by Stairs, without Steps, like the&s;e which I have el&s;e|where de&s;crib'd; which is to be &s;een at <HI>Ge|neva.</HI> You may ea&s;ily judge of the Beau|ty, Variety, and Rarity of the Landskip, which is di&s;cover'd from thence.</P>
<P>The <HI>Broglio</HI> is the Walk of the Nobles: they take up always one &s;ide of the Place; &s;ometimes for the Sun, and &s;ometimes for the Shade, according to the Sea&s;on. As their
<PB N="156" REF="98">
Number is great, and they are ordinarily to be &s;een no where el&s;e, the <HI>Broglio</HI> is the general Rendezvous, where Vi&s;its are made, and mo&s;t Affairs treated of. It is not per|mitted to mingle among&s;t them on that that &s;ide of the <HI>Promenade</HI> which they oc|cupy; but the other &s;ide is free. This place is &s;o particularly de&s;tin'd, and &s;et apart for them, that when a young Noble-man is come to the Age required for admittance into the Council, and to take the Robe, the fir&s;t Day he puts it on, Four Noble-men of his Friends do ceremoniou&s;ly in|troduce him into the <HI>Broglio;</HI> and when a|ny of them are bani&s;h'd the Council, the entrance into the <HI>Broglio</HI> is likewi&s;e for|bidden to them.</P>
<P>It was about the beginning of the Ninth Age, that the Merchants of <HI>Venice</HI> brought the Corps of St. <HI>Mark</HI> thither; they had, as is &s;aid, by I know not what chance, dug it out of the Earth, in the City of <HI>Alexandria</HI> in <HI>Egypt.</HI> And as there is a cer|tain Tradition, which tells us, that this E|vangeli&s;t being in Pri&s;on, Chri&s;t appeared to him, and &s;aluted him in the&s;e Words; <HI>Peace be to thee, Mark, my Evangeli&s;t.</HI> The Senate of <HI>Venice</HI> receiv'd al&s;o the Body of the Saint with the &s;ame Words, when it was brought to their City: It is for this that you &s;ee them written upon the open Book, held by the Lion of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> in the Arms of <HI>Venice.</HI> You may imagine, there was great rejoycing for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on of the Relicks of this Evangeli&s;t; which

it &s;eems they could give no greater Te&s;ti|mony of, than by preferring him, as they did, to poor St. <HI>Theodore,</HI> the ancient Pa|tron of the Republick, who had not given them the lea&s;t cau&s;e of Complaint. But they &s;topt not here; for be&s;ides divers o|ther Honours which they paid to the Bones of the New-comer, they built the above|mention'd Church to his Honour, where they placed that Sacred Trea&s;ure. It is true, they took &s;o little care to di&s;tingui&s;h the Shrine or Tomb, that they know not at pre&s;ent preci&s;ely where it is; which is no &s;mall Affliction to tho&s;e who bear an extraordinary Devotion to this Saint.</P>
<P>I will not &s;top to tell you the Hi&s;tory of his Apparition, (which, &s;ay they, happen'd Two Hundred and &s;eventy Years after they had brought him to <HI>Venice</HI>) when he &s;hew|ed his Arm to the Doge, and gave him a Ring of Gold, which is carried every Year in Proce&s;&s;ion, on the Twenty fifth Day of <HI>June.</HI> Nor will I tell you an infinite number of other Stories, which are made on this Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Patriarchal Church is dedicated to St. <HI>Peter;</HI> and that of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> as rich as it is, is but a Chapel; it is the Doge's Chapel. The <HI>Primicerio,</HI> who is the Dean of the Canons of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> wears a Mi|ter and Rochet, as Bi&s;hops do, and de|pends not on the Patriarch. I have &s;een him officiate on <HI>Chri&s;tmas-day</HI> in great Ce|remony; the Altar being adorn'd with mo&s;t rich Pieces of the Trea&s;ury: He is

always a noble <HI>Venetian,</HI> and his Yearly Revenue amounts to almo&s;t a Thou&s;and Pounds Sterling.</P>
<P>The Church of St. <HI>Mark</HI> de&s;erves an exact De&s;cription; but that is too great a Work for a Traveller: I &s;hall therefore content my &s;elf with giving you &s;ome general Account of it. It is a Building Square, or almo&s;t Square, of a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The Church is a Cro&s;s &s;hortned, <HI>Greek</HI>-wi&s;e. There are ma|ny <HI>Gothick</HI> Ornaments.</NOTE> <HI>Greek</HI> Structure, ob&s;cure, and indifferent high, but extraordinarily enrich'd with Marble, and <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Work. The Roof con&s;i&s;ts of &s;everal Domes, and that in the mid&s;t ex|ceeds the re&s;t in greatne&s;s. Of all the Sta|tues which are on the out&s;ide of the Church, there are but Two good ones; The <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> by <HI>Riccio,</HI> which you &s;ee when you de&s;cend the great Stairs of the Palace. I &s;peak not of the Four Brazen Hor&s;es which are over the great Portal, becau&s;e they are foreign Pieces which came thither accidentally. I learn|ed from one skilled in Antiquity, that the&s;e Hor&s;es belong'd to a Chariot of the Sun, that &s;erv'd for Ornament to a Trium|phal-Arch, which the Senate of <HI>Rome</HI> erected for <HI>Nero,</HI> after the Victory of that Prince over the <HI>Parthians;</HI> which may be &s;till &s;een, &s;aith he, on the Rever&s;e of &s;ome of his Medals. <HI>Con&s;tantine the Great</HI> carried them from <HI>Rome</HI> to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> where he plac'd them in the <HI>Hippodrome;</HI> and at la&s;t the <HI>Venetians</HI> having made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of that City, brought hither ma|ny of its rich Spoils, of which number
<PB N="159" REF="99">
were the&s;e Hor&s;es. One may &s;till perceive in &s;ome places that they were gilded.</P>
<P>One of the things which &s;eems to me mo&s;t remarkable in the Church of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> is the va&s;t quantity of <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Work, with which it is adorn'd. All the Pavement is made of it, and all its ar|ched Roofs are cover'd with it. Becau&s;e you have not &s;een this kind of Work, and would have me to &s;ay &s;omething of it, I will explain it to you as well as I can. <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Work came from <HI>Greece,</HI> but they tell us that the u&s;e of it hath been in <HI>Italy</HI> for near Two Thou&s;and Years pa&s;t. <HI>Vitruvius</HI> who lived in the time of <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> &s;peaks of it under the terms of <HI>opus &s;ectile, pavimenta &s;ectilia, opera mu&s;aea &amp; mu&s;iva:</HI> It was likewi&s;e called <HI>te&s;|&s;ellatum &amp; vermiculatum opus.</HI></P>
<P>All Works compos'd of little inlaid Pieces, whether they be of Stone, Wood, Ivory, Enamel, or any other Matter; or whether they be Repre&s;entations of Things Natural, or only <HI>Morisk</HI> or <HI>Ja|pan</HI> Figures; all the&s;e are comprehended under the name of <HI>Mo&s;aick:</HI> So that there are many fa&s;hions of it. You know what Inlaid Work is; you have al&s;o &s;een the fine Works of <HI>Florence</HI> Stone; and to &s;peak after a loo&s;er manner, all the&s;e are <HI>Mo&s;aick.</HI> And that which makes the great|e&s;t Ornament of the Church of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> is, that almo&s;t all the Work is of this nature. For want of Natural Stones, which would be hard to find for a Work
<PB N="160" REF="100">
&s;o va&s;t, and which would take up an im|men&s;e time to poli&s;h and prepare; They have recour&s;e to Pa&s;tes, and compo&s;iti|ons of Gla&s;s and Enamel, which they make in a Crucible or Melting-Pot; this takes a mo&s;t lively and &s;hining Co|lour, which never wears nor &s;tains. E|very Piece of the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> of St. <HI>Mark</HI> is a little Cube, which is not above Three Lines thick, or Four at the mo&s;t. All the Field is of <HI>Mo&s;aick,</HI> gilded with mo&s;t bright Gold, and incorporated in the Fire, upon the Superficies of one of the Faces of the Square: And all the&s;e Figures with their Draperies and Ornaments, are co|loured according to nature, by the due lay|ing together of all the Pieces of the Work. All the&s;e little bits are di&s;po&s;ed according to the De&s;ign which the Workman, has in view, and are &s;trictly adju&s;ted together in the compound Matter, or Plai&s;ter pre|par'd to receive them; which pre&s;ently after becomes hard. The be&s;t of this Work is its &s;olidity. It is more than Eight hundred and fifty Years that it hath la&s;ted, without the lea&s;t diminution of its Beauty.</P>
<P>The Pavement of the Church is al&s;o exceedingly Curious; and tho' it hath been in many places very much &s;poil'd, and in &s;ome places worn, it may be thought a kind of Miracle that &s;uch great pieces remain &s;till entire, after they have been trod under Foot for &s;o many Ages. They are little pieces of <HI>Ja&s;par,</HI>
<PB N="161" REF="100">
of <HI>Porphyrie,</HI> &s;potted green <HI>Marble,</HI> and <HI>Marble</HI> of divers Colours, which make al|&s;o Compartiments different from each o|ther.</P>
<P>I pa&s;s by the Relicks, the miraculous Images, and the other Holy Rarities which are in this Church; only I &s;hall menti|tion one of them, which &s;eems to me the mo&s;t curious, <HI>viz.</HI> the Rock which <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;truck in the Wilderne&s;s; It is in the Chapel of&mdash;at the end of the Font; it is a kind of greyi&s;h Marble: No|thing is more plea&s;ant than the Three little Holes out of which they affirm the Water i&s;&s;ued: They are plac'd Triangular|wi&s;e, about Two Fingers from each other, and the Bore of each hole is no bigger than the hollow of a Goo&s;e-Quill. I a&s;|&s;ure you, it is a double Miracle, that &s;o much Water, in &s;o little Time, &s;hould i&s;|&s;ue out of &s;uch narrow Holes, as &s;hould &s;uffice to quench the thir&s;t of an Army of Six hundred thou&s;and Men, with all their Wives, Children, and Cattle.</P>
<P>They made us ob&s;erve a Piece of <HI>Por|phyrie,</HI> enchas'd in the Pavement, in the middle of the Portico of the Church, over|again&s;t the great Door; it is to mark out the Place wherein Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> III. &s;et his Foot, as they &s;ay, on the Neck of the Emperor <HI>Frederick Barbaro&s;&s;a,</HI> when that Prince came to &s;ubmit to him for the ob|taining of a Peace. I am not ignorant that <HI>Baronius</HI> and &s;ome others, have criti|cized this Hi&s;tory, and rejected it as a Fa|ble:
<PB N="162" REF="101">
But I mu&s;t tell you, by the by, &s;ince Opportunity pre&s;ents, that what-ever probability may &s;eem to be in the Rea&s;ons, they alledge, they cannot pa&s;s for more than Su&s;picions and Conjectures, and can never amount to a convincing Refutation of a Story atte&s;ted by &s;o great a number of Authors.</P>
<P><HI>Alexander</HI> III. was a haughty Man, his Enemies had provoked him, and he at la&s;t had the Plea&s;ure to Triumph over an Em|perour, and Four Anti-Popes. At the ve|ry time of his flight into <HI>France,</HI> he was &s;o proud as to &s;uffer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Louys</HI> the young King of <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Henry II.</HI> King of <HI>Eng|land.</HI></NOTE> Two Kings who met him, to alight, and both to take the Reins of his Bridle, and lead his Hor&s;e to the Lodging prepared for him.

<P>The Palace of St. <HI>Mark</HI> joins to the Church: It is a great Building, after the <HI>Gothick</HI> manner, yet 'tis very Magnificent: It hath been burned four or five times; and the various Reparations of it have &s;poiled the Uniformity of the Structure. The &s;ide which is on the Canal, is built
<PB N="166" REF="103">
of a kind of hard Stone, brought from <HI>I&s;tria,</HI> and the Architecture of it is highly e&s;teem'd: Were the re&s;t of the Building &s;uitable, it would be a mo&s;t excellent Piece. The Duke is lodg'd in this Palace; and here it is that the Council of State and all the Magi|&s;tracy do meet. The Apartments are large, lofty, and well wain&s;cotted, but dark in compari&s;on of the Light now a-days requi|red in Buildings. The Hall where the Bo|dy of the Nobles a&s;&s;emble, which, as you know, compo&s;es the <HI>Grand Council,</HI> in which the Sovereignty of the State re&s;ides, is extraordinary large, and adorn'd with Pictures; among which are the Portraitures of the Dukes; the Hi&s;tory of the Con|que&s;t of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> which was taken in the Year 1192, and lo&s;t about Three&s;core Years after; the Picture of <HI>Frederick</HI> and <HI>Alexander</HI> is there al&s;o, of the large&s;t &s;ize, and they have not forgot the Circum&s;tance of the Foot on the Neck. What I ob|&s;erv'd on this Picture, gives me opportunity to add &s;omething to what I have already told you on the &s;ame Subject. I think we ought not to take it in a rigorous and &s;trictly literal Sence, what is commonly &s;aid; That the Pope &s;et <HI>his</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">His Cloaths of Gold being laid down at the Feet of <HI>A|lexander,</HI> he begg'd Pardon, and the Pope putting his Right Foot on his Neck, &s;aid the Words of the P&s;alm, <HI>Super A&s;pidem &amp; Ba&s;ili&s;cum am|bulabis, &amp; conculcabis Leonem &amp; Draconem:</HI> At which Provocation the Emperour an&s;wer'd, <HI>Non tibi, &s;ed Petro.</HI> And the Pope treading harder, &s;aid, <HI>Et mihi, &amp; Petro.

<PB N="167" REF="103">
it &s;hall be compared to what is repre&s;ent|ed in this ancient Picture. The Pope therein appears to put his Foot lightly on the Shoulder of the Emperour, without &s;howing any Motion of Pa&s;&s;ion: And tho' the Hi&s;tory of the Popes mentions a great Number of 'em as outragious in their Pride, Bruti&s;hne&s;s, and Rage; and tho' this <HI>Alexander,</HI> Proud as he was, and of a revengeful Spirit, might then be guilty of any thing; neverthele&s;s an act of Violence on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion, among&s;t Strangers, in a Publick Place, and in the &s;ight of all the People, would have been, if well weigh'd, contrary to the Policy, as well as the Gravity of God's Vicar; whereas, it was not only a noble Briskne&s;s, but al&s;o the Duty of him who &s;upplies the Place of the Ma&s;ter of the Univer&s;e, and who&s;e Government extends it &s;elf over all the Kings of the World, on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion to maintain the Dignity of his Character. It is true, that the Submi&s;&s;ion and Repentance of the Va&s;&s;al, ought to have been receiv'd with a Spirit of Meekne&s;s; but it was ju&s;t that he &s;hould not be acquitted for a &s;in|gle Reverence. It was requi&s;ite, as I have &s;aid, that the Lieutenant of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> &s;hould maintain the Intere&s;t of his Ma&s;ter, and that, at lea&s;t, he &s;hould make his Power be known at the &s;ame time that he granted his Pardon. And if it be obje|cted, that all this Di&s;cour&s;e is founded on|ly on the Fancy of a Painter, who hath repre&s;ented this Story as he thought fit; I
<PB N="168" REF="104">
will an&s;wer fir&s;t, that this is a meer preca|rious a&s;&s;ertion. Painters do not always give them&s;elves a latitude, nor do they or|dinarily do it to the prejudice of an impor|tant circum&s;tance. And I mu&s;t tell you in the &s;econd place, that it is more rea&s;onable to believe this Picture, than to form chime|rical Notions to contradict it.</P>
<P>Some will perhaps alledge, that the Shoulder is not the Neck, but It hink it not worth the while to reply to &s;o frivolous an Objection. I hope you will pardon this little digre&s;&s;ion, to which I have been in|&s;en&s;ibly engaged, by rea&s;on of the di&s;cour&s;e we had on this Subject.</P>
<P>I have yet two things to relate to you, of the Palace of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> which, among&s;t others, &s;eem very remarkable.

it is adorn'd with Pictures, by <HI>Titian,</HI> and &s;ome other famous Ma&s;ters, which are in|finitely e&s;teemed.

<P>I &s;hall an&s;wer in a few words your Que|&s;tion concerning the Flux and Reflux, by confirming, without doubt, what you have learned el&s;ewhere. The Sea flows &s;ix hours, and ebbs as much: It is later
<PB N="172" REF="106">
every day by three quarters of an hour, or thereabouts, as upon the Coa&s;ts of the Sea you are acquainted with; and the Tide ri&s;es ordinarily at <HI>Venice</HI> four foot, or four foot and an half. But it is &s;ometimes more, and &s;ometimes le&s;s, as in all other places; and it agrees with the Moon, after the u|&s;ual manner: I &s;hall take care to impart to you the Ob&s;ervations I made all along the Gulf from <HI>Ravenna</HI> to <HI>Loretto.</HI></P>
<P>The Shore is extreamly plea&s;ant beyond tho&s;e long and narrow I&s;les, which make as it were Banks on the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> &s;ide, and which form a kind of Semicircle from <HI>North</HI> to <HI>South,</HI> round about <HI>Venice.</HI> This is properly called the main Sea: There you find Shell-fi&s;h, and the Walk is very diver|ti&s;ing when the Weather is Calm. They get &s;tore of Oy&s;ters there, but they want the excellent &s;avour of ours. They are looked upon as hurtful, and Strangers ab|&s;tain from eating &s;o many as in other places.</P>
<P>You have rea&s;on to &s;ay, that Policy and Liberty are two Words, which are in high e&s;teem at <HI>Venice.</HI> But it mu&s;t be allowed, that it is not the <HI>Venetians</HI> only who mag|nifie their own Policy. All the World, in my Opinion, doth acknowledge, that they endeavour'd to refine this Study, and have gained the point. This is an Opinion which I neither can nor will conte&s;t; I &s;hall only offer two Ob&s;ervations touch|ing this Subject: The fir&s;t is, that when we &s;peak generally of the Policy of <HI>Venice,</HI>
<PB N="173" REF="106">
we run immediately to a con&s;ideration which fills our Minds with Prejudices. Be|fore we proceed to take a nearer and more exact view of this boa&s;ted Policy, we judge of it by a deceitful appearance of a fal&s;e and ill-grounded Experience. The Re|publick of <HI>Venice,</HI> &s;ay they, hath main|tained it &s;elf for the&s;e twelve or thirteen hundred Years. What a wonderful thing is this, add they, and what greater proof can be de&s;ired of the Excellency of its Go|vernment? I &s;ay, that by re&s;ting here, without further &s;crutiny, they draw a fal&s;e Con&s;equence from an ill-grounded Princi|ple. To rea&s;on ju&s;tly, after this manner of &s;peaking, the Republick of <HI>Venice</HI> mu&s;t really have always maintain'd it &s;elf under one and the &s;ame Government: One might then admire the wi&s;e and happy Conduct of its Coun&s;els, which, by the various re|&s;ults of their Prudence, had pre&s;erved their State for &s;o long a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Ages. But the bu&s;ine&s;s will not go that way. To what purpo&s;e is it to di&s;&s;emble, what is obvious to the &s;ight and knowledge of all the World? The truth is, that the Govern|ment of <HI>Venice</HI> hath often changed its Con|&s;titution, without affirming what &s;ome maintain, that this Republick hath rendred Homage to the Kings of <HI>Italy.</HI> It is in vain to deny, that the Dukes were for a long time ab&s;olute Sovereigns; whether by Right or U&s;urpation, it matters not. The Republick of <HI>Venice</HI> was no more a Republick, when their Dukes commanded
<PB N="174" REF="107">
there with an Arbitrary Power, than the Commonwealth of <HI>Rome</HI> was a Common|wealth, under the fir&s;t <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s, or during the Triumvirate. And therefore we mu&s;t carefully ob&s;erve the differerence between the&s;e two Propo&s;itions: <HI>The Republick of</HI> Venice <HI>maintained it &s;elf for twelve hundred Years; or,</HI> Venice <HI>was a State, or the Head of a State for twelve hundred Years.</HI> The fir&s;t of the&s;e Propo&s;itions, in a &s;trict &s;en&s;e, is really fal&s;e; for the Rea&s;ons I alledged. The &s;econd is true; but nothing can be concluded from it. One might as well &s;ay, that <HI>Rome</HI> has been the Head of a State, for above two thou&s;and four hundred Years, but could not from thence conclude, that the State of <HI>Rome</HI> had maintained it &s;elf during all that time; for to change its face and con&s;titution, is not to maintain it &s;elf.</P>
<P>My &s;econd Remark upon this Policy, which makes &s;o much noi&s;e, is, that the Signiory of <HI>Venice</HI> being confin'd within &s;o narrow limits, in compari&s;on of the great States of the World, and all the am|bition of this Republick; I &s;peak princi|pally as it &s;tands at pre&s;ent, being only to live quietly and peaceably with all the World; I &s;ee no nece&s;&s;ity it hath of &s;uch great activity of Spirit, or high efforts of Wit, to maintain it &s;elf in quiet. When the Republick of <HI>Rome</HI> a&s;pired to the Em|pire of the Univer&s;e, when it endeavoured to fill the World with its Colonies, and had already made &s;o many Kings its Tri|butaries,
<PB N="175" REF="107">
and was to find out the Secret, to make it &s;elf both feared and loved by the Provinces it had newly &s;ubdued; then it was that Policy was nece&s;&s;arily required. But there is no &s;uch occa&s;ion for it at <HI>Venice.</HI> If the little Republick of St. <HI>Marin</HI> &s;hould make Rhodomontades of its Policy on the <HI>Broglio,</HI> do you not think it would ju&s;tly be laugh'd at? And, without derogating from the Glory and Power that <HI>Venice</HI> hath &s;everal times acquired; it is certainly true, that <HI>Venice</HI> is no more to be compared to old <HI>Rome,</HI> than St. <HI>Marin</HI> can come in competition with <HI>Venice.</HI></P>
<P>I might add, for a third Remark, that the wonderful Policy of <HI>Venice</HI> hath not hindred the many declen&s;ions into which that Republick hath fallen.</P>
<P>The Commonwealth's-men talk of no|thing but their Liberty; yet the&s;e poor People are Slaves to their Ma&s;ters, as all other People are, under what Government &s;oever they live: And, in the mean time, they &s;tuff their Heads, with I know not what pretended notions of Liberty, as if every one of them were a little Prince. But it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that the Inhabi|tants of <HI>Venice,</HI> have more rea&s;on than any to boa&s;t of theirs. I will tell you in two words, what that Liberty is: You mu&s;t never in the lea&s;t meddle with the Affairs of State: You mu&s;t commit no enormous Crimes puni&s;hable by Ju&s;tice, which may render you, by their notoriety &s;ubject to be taken notice of; and for the re&s;t, you
<PB N="176" REF="108">
may do what you plea&s;e, without troubling your Head with what People talk of you. This is the &s;umm of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Liberty. I might tell you many things on this Sub|ject, very particular and &s;carcely to be be|lieved: But the&s;e reflections having already carried me too far, we will deferr the fur|ther con&s;ideration of 'em to another oppor|tunity.</P>
<P>To an&s;wer your Que&s;tions about the to|leration of Religions, I can tell you, that the <HI>Greeks,</HI> the <HI>Armenians,</HI> and the <HI>Jews,</HI> are allow'd the publick Exerci&s;e of their Religions; all other Sects are &s;uffer'd or conniv'd at, but they order their Meetings after &s;o &s;ecret and prudent a manner, that the Senate hath no rea&s;on to complain of the Abu&s;es or Indi&s;cretion of any Per&s;on.</P>
<P>Moreover, though the Wor&s;hipping of Images and Reliques, and many other Su|per&s;titions reign at <HI>Venice,</HI> it is only among&s;t the common People, to whom they are willing to grant the&s;e amu&s;ements. The eminent Wits care neither for this, nor any thing el&s;e. Formerly the <HI>Venetians</HI> were as &s;imple as the re&s;t of the Popi&s;h World. The Excommunications of the Pope &s;cared them, and &s;ometimes did them a great deal of Mi&s;chief. That of <HI>Clement</HI> V. for example, made a terrible pother among 'em, and &s;poiled all their Trade: But now they trouble not them&s;elves about 'em, and the Liberties of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Church are at pre&s;ent as great as tho&s;e of the <HI>Gallican.</HI> They take notice of the Pope as a Prince, but do
<PB N="177" REF="108">
not much regard him as Pope. When the Je&s;uites, who are the mo&s;t potent &s;upport of that which they call the Holy See, would have &s;ubmitted them&s;elves to the order of Su&s;pen&s;ion, which all the Clergy of <HI>Venice</HI> had from Pope <HI>Paul</HI> the Fifth, they were drawn out as Enemies and Di&s;turbers of the State. And tho' for &s;ome Rea&s;ons at the in&s;tant &s;ollicitations of the Court of <HI>Rome,</HI> they were afterwards recalled; it was on condition that they &s;hould not rai&s;e Sedi|tions as they formerly had done. And even tho' they continu'd &s;till to entertain &s;uch de&s;igns, the Republick knows how to order them: but con&s;idering the Precautions that are u&s;ed, the toleration of the Je&s;uites at <HI>Venice</HI> can produce no ill Con&s;equences: For, as I am told, they &s;uffer none there but &s;uch as are born &s;ubjects to the State; and they a&s;&s;ure me, that the Superiour mu&s;t be a Native of the City. In a word, it is cer|tain that Me&s;&s;ieurs of <HI>Venice</HI> &s;uffer them|&s;elves to be Governed neither by the Prie&s;ts nor the Monks. Tho&s;e Fathers are per|mitted to wear Masks during the Carnival, to treat their Concubines, &s;ing on the Stages, and do what they plea&s;e, but they dare not thru&s;t their No&s;es into the Affairs of State. The Senate is wi&s;e enough to be &s;en&s;ible of the di&s;orders which happen when they are permitted to meddle with the Government: Nor do they con&s;ult them when any thing comes under deliberation.</P>
<P>I have taken particular care to examine the Creed of the <HI>Greeks</HI> which are here,
<PB N="178" REF="109">
touching the Articles of which you write. But to &s;peak freely, though I find them profe&s;&s;ed Enemies of the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion, and that they declaim furiou&s;ly again&s;t the U&s;urpations of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Rome,</HI> when they &s;peak with freedom: I perceive by their Di&s;cour&s;e, that whether by Contagi|on, or by &s;ome other rea&s;on they differ very much in many points from the other <HI>Greek</HI> Churches, which are at pre&s;ent under the Dominion of the <HI>Turk;</HI> at lea&s;t if we may believe the relations of tho&s;e Countries. So that the Opinions of the&s;e ought not to make us conclude any thing concerning the belief of the <HI>Greeks</HI> in general. To deal plainly with you, they declare that they believe Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, which is not enough to determine the Que&s;tion, which has made &s;o much noi&s;e, and at the bottom makes nothing again&s;t tho&s;e who will not admit that Doctrine. They make u&s;e of common Bread, they mingle Water with the Wine, and communicate under both kinds. There are two Altars in their Church, one which they call the Altar of <HI>Preparation,</HI> and the other of <HI>Con&s;ecration.</HI> On the fir&s;t they cut the Bread with a Knife, like the Steel head of a Spear. There al&s;o they mingle the Water with the Wine, and the Prie&s;t takes it with a Sponge out of the Ve&s;&s;el in which it was fir&s;t mixed, and afterwards &s;queezes it out into the Chalice. They embrace one another before they receive the Sacrament: And the Commu|nicants receive the Bread &s;teeped in the
<PB N="179" REF="109">
Wine, the Prie&s;t putting it with a Spoon into their Mouths: All this we &s;aw. The Arch-Bi&s;hop who officiated, had a Mitre fa&s;hioned like an Imperial Crown, and all his other Ornaments were magnificent; and they were changed from time to time, ac|cording to the &s;everal parts of the Service.</P>
<P>There are among&s;t them an infinite num|ber of Ceremonies and My&s;teries. When the Bi&s;hop ble&s;&s;es the People, he holdeth in his Right-hand a Candle&s;tick of three branches, with the Tapers lighted, which is as an Emblem of the Per&s;ons of the Trinity. The Candle&s;tick which he holds in his Left|hand, hath two Branches, to denote the two Natures of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> I will not en|gage further into the confu&s;ed number of the&s;e my&s;terious Repre&s;entations. Their Churches are divided into four Parts; the Altars are in the place which they call Holy, at one end of the Church. There are none but he who officiates, and tho&s;e who &s;erve him who commonly enter there. The &s;e|cond place is appointed for the other parts of the Service: The Men are in the third place, which is &s;eparated only from the &s;e|cond by little Bali&s;ters, and the Women are behind a Lettice, at the other end of the Church, or in the Galleries. All the Ser|vice is perform'd in vulgar <HI>Greek,</HI> which is their natural Language, and under&s;tood by the People. They highly condemn the u&s;e of unknown Languages in the Church: They wor&s;hip &s;tanding, bowing the Head, and putting their Hands on their Brea&s;t.
<PB N="180" REF="110">
Tho&s;e who are married, may come to Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tial Preferments without quitting their Wives: But tho&s;e that are received before Marriage, are not afterwards &s;uf|fered to marry. They &s;ay decency permits not a Per&s;on to marry above thrice; &s;o that they forbid fourth Marriages. They deny Purgatory, and you know by what Principles: They pray for the Dead. There are very few here who believe a Temporary Hell from which the Elect are delivered; but they pray for the Souls which they &s;ay are in a &s;eparate State, expecting the la&s;t Judgment. The u&s;e of Confe&s;&s;ion is much practi&s;ed among&s;t them, but not after the <HI>Roman</HI> manner. The Article of the pro|ceeding of the Holy Gho&s;t, they put in the rank of tho&s;e which are more curious than edifying; in&s;omuch that it is now pa&s;&s;ed over with as much &s;ilence as former|ly it made noi&s;e. They keep certain Re|licks as precious and &s;acred Memorials, but render no Wor&s;hip to them. I remember I have read in <HI>Thevet,</HI> That the <HI>Greeks</HI> of <HI>Athens</HI> &s;olemnly excommunicate the Pope on <HI>Good-Friday.</HI> And the Monk <HI>Surras</HI> re|ports, That at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> they pray to God every day in a certain part of the Publick Service, that he would keep them &s;till un|der the Dominion of the <HI>Turk,</HI> rather than &s;uffer them to fall under that of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>I have u&s;ed all my endeavours to obtain &s;ome particular Information, concerning the Creed and Wor&s;hip of the <HI>Armenians,</HI> that I might know it from the fir&s;t hand;
<PB N="181" REF="110">
but I have not hitherto had an opportunity to get acquaintance with any of them, nor have I yet been pre&s;ent at their Publick Wor|&s;hip, becau&s;e they are at pre&s;ent at Work in the repair of their Church, and &s;o cannot yet a&s;&s;emble there. One of my Friends, among other things, a&s;&s;ur'd me of the&s;e four or five Articles. That they Communicate under both kinds: That they give the Sa|crament to little Children: That they be|lieve the &s;eque&s;tration of Souls as the <HI>Greeks</HI> do: That they give a Bill of Divorce: That they believe there will be no difference of Sexes after the Re&s;urrection. And after all, there are &s;o many particular Opinions a|mong all the&s;e People, that it is not ea&s;ie to tell po&s;itively what they believe.</P>
<P>There are yet many particulars in my Journal, with which I might entertain you at pre&s;ent; but I had rather joyn them to tho&s;e other Ob&s;ervations which I &s;hall make hereafter, that I may have occa&s;ion to add al&s;o &s;uch new In&s;tructions as I hope to receive.</P>
<P>I was ju&s;t now with the Abbot <HI>Lith,</HI> whom I mention'd before; and it comes into my Mind to inform you, before I fi|ni&s;h my Letter, of a thing which he a&s;&s;ured me of, and I &s;hould have been &s;orry to have forgotten, though it hath no relation to <HI>Venice.</HI> We were di&s;cour&s;ing of the few numerous Families which are taken notice of here, in compari&s;on to other places; and he told me, on this occa&s;ion, that one of his Kindred had twenty four Sons by one Wife, who were all marri'd; and that all
<PB N="182" REF="111">
the twenty four with their &s;everal Wives, had been &s;een in a Company together: Though there is nothing in this but what is very po&s;&s;ible, yet is it a thing extreamly rare.</P>

Bridge hath but one Arch, and all the Miracle con&s;i&s;ts in the Greatne&s;s of this Arch. I took care to mea&s;ure it, that I might give you a certain Account of it. The Compa&s;s of the Arch makes exactly the third part of a Circle, and there are Ninety Foot from one End, or one Ex|tremity of the Arch to the other, on the level of the Canal: from which we may gather, that the Arch is near Twenty four Foot high. No Per&s;on will deny, as I conceive, that a great Building of any kind &s;oever, de&s;erves more con&s;iderati|on than an indifferent one; but in my Opinion, it mu&s;t al&s;o be confe&s;s'd, that when they are both of the &s;ame nature, and there is not a very remarkable diffe|rence in their Greatne&s;s, there is nothing more incomprehen&s;ible in the one, than in the other. This here ought not to &s;tand in Compari&s;on with tho&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The Bridge of <HI>Civenchu</HI> in <HI>Japan</HI> is Three hundred and &s;ixty Fa|thom long, and Six and a half broad.

The Bridge of <HI>Tin&s;em</HI> is not &s;o long, but is more curious, as con&s;i&s;ting but of one only Stone. <HI>Dutch Emba&s;&s;y to the Emp. of Japan.</HI> Part <HI>I.</HI></NOTE> great Works, of which the bare undertaking, is, in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;urprizing: It is an Arch of a Bridge, which is &s;omewhat bigger than tho&s;e that are u&s;ually made; and this is all the Miracle. I might al&s;o put you in mind of a Fault in the Structure of this Bridge, according to that Maxim in Ar|chitecture, That to give the greater &s;trength to an Arch, it is nece&s;&s;ary that its Com|pa&s;s make an entire Semi-Circle, whereas
<PB N="184" REF="114">
this makes but a Third part of a Circle, as I have already told you. But to &s;peak freely, I cannot find any &s;olidity in the Rea&s;oning of tho&s;e who e&s;tabli&s;h'd this Principle. And I conceive clearly, that when an Arch makes any part of a Cir|cle, let the Portion be never &s;o little, if the Semi-Circle do not wholly appear, yet it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed, and really is, in the Piles or other Foundations which re|&s;i&s;t the Weight or Bearing of the Arch; and &s;o comes to the &s;ame thing. To be fully convinc'd of what I &s;ay, one need but con&s;ider, that if an Arch which would de&s;cribe an entire Semi-Circle, were wal|led up, and fill'd to &s;uch a height, that only the Sixth Part of its Circumference &s;hould appear; or if you will, a Sixth part of a Circle, this top of the Arch would loo&s;e nothing of the force it had before. The Bridge of the <HI>Rialto</HI> is very &s;olidly built, with great pieces of a kind of white Marble; there are two Ranges of Shops which divide it into Three Streets, the great one in the mid&s;t, and the little ones between the Rails and the back-&s;ides of the Shops. Generally the other Bridges have no Buttre&s;&s;es; they are &s;ingle Arches. You go up to them by Steps, which are almo&s;t all of a certain white Stone, hard and &s;lippery; which partly gave occa&s;ion for the Proverb that advi&s;es to beware of the Four <HI>P's</HI> of <HI>Venice, Pietra Bianca, Putana, Prete, Pantalone;</HI> the white Stones, Whores, Prie&s;ts, and Pantaloons.</P>

Of more than One hundred and fifty Wells which are here, there are but Two or Three good for any thing; and the be&s;t Water is the Rain-Water which &s;ome private Per&s;ons re&s;erve in Ci&s;terns.

<P>Strangers have &s;o little Commerce with the Natives of this Country, that it is dif|ficult to learn their Cu&s;toms, and Manners of Hou&s;e-keeping: Wherefore I can &s;ay very little concerning the&s;e things. I read the other day in a Preface of <HI>Henry Ste|phens,</HI> that in his time, they had an ill O|pinion in <HI>France,</HI> of a Woman who went Bare-Neck'd; whereas in <HI>Italy,</HI> and particu|larly at <HI>Venice,</HI> every old Hag expos'd her wither'd and &s;wagging Brea&s;ts to view. But things are much<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">There are none but pro|fe&s;&s;ed Whores who &s;hew their Necks bare.</NOTE> chang'd &s;ince his time. At pre&s;ent the Women of Quali|ty are &s;hut up &s;o clo&s;e, that you can &s;carcely &s;ee their Face; not even in the Churches, which are the only places where they appear in Publick. When they go abroad, they are &s;hut up in their <HI>Gondo|la</HI>'s, and accompanied with Two or Three old Women, who never leave them. The ordinary Women cover them&s;elves with a great Scarf, which opens only a little before their Eyes; and they go abroad but rarely, becau&s;e the Men make Pro|vi&s;ion, and take care of all Bu&s;ine&s;s with|out Doors.</P>
<P>They &s;end the Girls to the Convent in their tendere&s;t Infancy; and when grown up, they conclude their Marriages without their Knowledge; nay often with|out letting them &s;ee their future Husbands.
<PB N="187" REF="115">
That you may not be &s;urprized at this, you are to know that they make not Marriages here on the &s;ame Accounts they do in other places. They never trou|ble them&s;elves with Love, Affection, or E&s;teem. If any of tho&s;e things happen, it is good luck; but they mind nothing but Kindred and Riches, not regarding the Per&s;on. The u&s;e of Concubines is &s;o generally receiv'd, that the greate&s;t part of the Wives live in good Corre&s;pon|dence with their Rivals; and that way the Men remedy the per&s;onal Faults of the Women which they marry. There is al&s;o another &s;ort of keeping Concubines, very much u&s;ed by tho&s;e of tender Con|&s;ciences; a thing in truth very rare at <HI>Ve|nice.</HI> It is a kind of clande&s;tine Marriage, the Ceremony whereof is not perform'd a long time after the Con&s;ummation; and commonly &s;ome Days, or &s;ome Hours perhaps, only before the death of one of the Parties. The Men find this Method convenient, becau&s;e it keeps the Women in perpetual awe, and con&s;tant complai|&s;ance, being in daily fear of being turn'd off. I know a rich Merchant who hath lived thus for above Twenty Years with his Female Companion; when he is in a good Humour, he will promi&s;e to marry her before he dies, and make their Chil|dren his Heirs. But the mo&s;t u&s;ual pra|ctice is, to live on the Common, at &s;o long kept, &s;o much paid, until the fir&s;t de&s;ire of change, without fixing on any

certain Per&s;on either for Wife or Concu|bine. Tho&s;e who have not the Means &s;ingly to keep a Whore, join with Two or Three Friends; and this Plurality, which would in other places be in&s;up|portable, does here make the Knot of Friend&s;hip firmer between Companions of equal Fortunes. Libertini&s;m, in re&s;pect of Women, is turn'd to &s;o common and gene|ral a Cu&s;tom, that, to &s;peak truly, it takes away all &s;ence and remembrance of the Sin. As one of their fine&s;t Stroaks of Po|licy here, is to bring up all Per&s;ons in Ef|feminacy, and e&s;pecially the young Nobi|lity: The Mothers are the fir&s;t who find out Courte&s;ans for their Sons, that they may be &s;ure to hinder them from falling into Contagious Pits; and when they have agreed with the Father and Mother for &s;ome young poor Maiden; all her Kindred come, and in cold Blood, wi&s;h her Joy, as if it were for a Marriage lawfully con|tracted. You would be &s;urprized to &s;ee a Mother deliver up her Daughter, for a cer|tain Summ of Money, Monthly or Year|ly paid; and &s;wear &s;olemly by God, and her own Soul, that &s;he cannot afford it for le&s;s. We mu&s;t not &s;ay that all Mothers will do the &s;ame, but certainly it is a thing commonly practi&s;ed. I was infor|med by a good Catholick, that the Con|fe&s;&s;ors will not trouble them&s;elves with lit|tle Stories of this Work, they will not hear &s;uch Trifles, but ask pre&s;ently, <HI>quatite altra co&s;a, &s;omething el&s;e.</HI> Be&s;ides, there are
<PB N="189" REF="116">
none but &s;ome Fools of Foreign Courte&s;ans, who by a kind of nice Scruple which they bring from their own Country, have ac|cu&s;tom'd them&s;elves from time to time to hear a Ma&s;s. It is true, this co&s;ts them but little, becau&s;e tho&s;e they employ have re|ciprocally need of their A&s;&s;i&s;tance; they are not unkind to each other; and it is not difficult &s;o to order Affairs, that they may have no occa&s;ion to be out of Poc|ket. There are whole Streets of Ladies of Plea&s;ure, who entertain all Comers; and whereas the Habits of other Per&s;ons are black and melancholy, the&s;e are cloathed in red and yellow, like Tulips; with their Brea&s;ts open, their Faces painted foot deep, and always a No&s;egay above their Ears: you may &s;ee them by Dozens at the Gates or Windows; and the Pa&s;&s;ers by &s;eldom '&s;cape them without a torn Sleeves.</P>
<P>The Carnival always begins the &s;econd Holiday in <HI>Chri&s;tmas;</HI> that is to &s;ay, from thence they are permitted to wear Masks, and to open the Play-Hou&s;es and Gaming-Hou&s;es: Then they are not &s;atisfied with the ordinary Libertini&s;m, they improve all their Plea&s;ures, and plunge into them up to the Neck. All the City is di&s;guis'd; Vice and Vertue were never &s;o well coun|terfeited, and ab&s;olutely change both Names and Cu&s;toms.

You would &s;wear, that all the World were turn'd Fools in an In&s;tant. It is true, that the fury of the&s;e Baccha|nals comes not pre&s;ently to the height; there is &s;ome moderation in the beginning. But when they begin to be &s;en&s;ible of the dreaded Approach of the fatal <HI>Wedne&s;day,</HI> which impo&s;es an univer&s;al Silence, then it is that they celebrate their great Fea&s;ts, and all without revel on <HI>Shrove-Tue&s;day</HI> Ma&s;|querade.

I &s;hall in|timate Two things which come into my Head on this Occa&s;ion: The common Peo|ple always love Sports and other Diverti&s;e|ments. As abominable as that Mon&s;ter <HI>Nero</HI> was, he was lamented by the Mobb, becau&s;e of his Shows. I imagine then, that the Nobility, who otherwi&s;e are not well beloved, are very glad to find &s;ome cunning ways to plea&s;e and amu&s;e the People. There is yet another thing which &s;eems to me of &s;ome moment. I am credibly inform'd, that at the la&s;t Car|nival, there was an account of Seven So|vereign Princes, and Thirty thou&s;and other Foreigners. Con&s;ider how much Money all this Multitude mu&s;t have brought to <HI>Venice.</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t, according to your de&s;ire, give you my Sentiment of the Opera's and Co|medies

acted here; tho' in the mean time, I mu&s;t confe&s;s my aver&s;ene&s;s to meddle with this particular; becau&s;e I fear I &s;hall in your Opinion be e&s;teem'd too &s;ingular in mine. You &s;eem to me to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with great Prejudices in favour of the&s;e fa|mous Shows; and I fan&s;ie you expect &s;omething which may exceed the <HI>Idea</HI> you have already &s;een of them. I entreat you then, to &s;et a&s;ide all your Prejudices, and to believe I will do as much; that I may be able to give you an impartial Ac|count of things as I found them. I will do it in few Words, without critici&s;ing on Opera's in general, in which I have al|ways been offended at &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages which &s;eem contrary both to Probability and Rea&s;on. But &s;ince you will have it &s;o, we will &s;uppo&s;e that all the Repre&s;en|tation of an Opera, is the be&s;t contrived thing in the World; and I will keep my &s;elf within the Bounds you have pre&s;cri|bed me, which is to &s;peak to you with relation to Opera's which you have &s;een at <HI>Paris:</HI> It is undeniable matter of Fact, that the Ornaments of tho&s;e here fall ex|treamly &s;hort of the&s;e; the Habits are poor, no Dances, and commonly no Ma|chines, nor any Illuminations, only &s;ome Candles here and there, which de&s;erve not to be mentioned. 'Tis dangerous not to magnifie the <HI>Italian</HI> Mu&s;ick, or to &s;ay, at lea&s;t, any thing again&s;t it. Neither will I in&s;i&s;t on this Subject, but confe&s;s, in the general, that they have mo&s;t excellent
<PB N="192" REF="118">
Ayres, and that there are &s;ome good Voi|ces among&s;t them. Thus, for Example, the <HI>Vicentin</HI> Song&s;ter of the <HI>Ho&s;pitalettes</HI> is a little charming Creature. But I cannot forbear telling you, that I find I know not what Confu&s;ion and Unplea&s;antne&s;s in &s;everal Parts of the Songs in their Ope|ra's: They dwell many times longer on one Quavering, than in &s;inging Four whole Lines; and often they run &s;o fa&s;t, that it is hard to tell whether they Sing or Speak, or whether they do either or both to|gether. Every one has his Humour for me; I confe&s;s, among&s;t other things, the over-&s;train'd Shrill agrees not with me, tho' there be much trouble to reach it, and it be wonderfully grateful to the Ears of tho&s;e People. The Concert is much le&s;s than at <HI>Paris,</HI> but perhaps it is never the wor&s;e for that. There is al&s;o one thing which charms them, which I be|lieve would not plea&s;e you; I mean tho&s;e unhappy Men who ba&s;ely &s;uffer them&s;elves to be maimed, that they may have the finer Voices. The &s;illy Figure, which in my Opinion, &s;uch a mutilated Fellow makes, who one time acts the Bully, and &s;ometimes the Pa&s;&s;ionate Lo|ver, with his Effeminate Voice, and wrinkled Face, is not to be endured. It is impo&s;&s;ible that Fellows of this Make can have Spirits nece&s;&s;ary for the Beauty of Action; and indeed there is nothing more cold and feeble than the manner after which they act their Parts.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="118">There are at pre&s;ent Seven &s;everal O|pera's at <HI>Venice;</HI> and one cannot choo&s;e but be there every Evening, if it were only but to find Company: But &s;ince you would have me &s;peak ingenuou&s;ly, I I mu&s;t tell you, that we impatiently ex|pect the end of the Piece, before we have heard a quarter of it. You mu&s;t know there is a Buffoon in every Opera: You may imagine what a Figure this Actor makes with his Fooleries in the mo&s;t Serious, and even &s;ometimes mo&s;t Tragi|cal part of the Play.

Neverthele&s;s, let them be never &s;o &s;illy, there is always &s;ome Grimace, with &s;ome Po&s;ture or Trick of <HI>Harlequin,</HI> that makes the Spectators laugh; the mo&s;t lu&s;cious Bawdy is pronounced in the mo&s;t ex|pre&s;&s;ive terms, and the little Dam&s;els of tho&s;e Societies never mince the matter.

<P>The places which they call <HI>Ridetti,</HI> are properly the Academies of <HI>Ba&s;&s;et:</HI> They are open'd at the &s;ame time with the Theaters; there are none but Noble-men who cut. They di&s;mi&s;s the Game&s;ters when they plea&s;e; and they have &s;o much good Fortune joyn'd to their Privileges, and good Play, that the Bank is almo&s;t always Fortunate. There are Ten or Twelve Chambers on a Floor, with Ga|ming-Tables in all of them. You can &s;carcely turn your &s;elf in them; but tho' the Throng is &s;o great, yet is there a profound Silence. To come into the&s;e places you mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be mask'd. The Courte&s;ans come thither in Shoals; and the other Ladies al&s;o, who under their Masks may enjoy all the publick Plea&s;ures of the Carnival; but they &s;till are follow'd by Spies, or by their Hus|bands. Be&s;ides the Chambers of Play, there are &s;ome for Conver&s;ation, where they al&s;o &s;ell Liquors, Sweet-meats, and &s;uch like things. They put not off their Masks; and by the Privilege of this Di&s;|gui&s;e, provided they be in good Cloaths, they may &s;peak to the Ladies, even to tho&s;e whom they may &s;uppo&s;e of the high|e&s;t Quality: But you mu&s;t injure no Bo|dy.

as well as el&s;ewhere, that which they call Nobility, according to the common Ex|pre&s;&s;ion, con&s;i&s;ts but in Fancy and Opini|on, as all other things in the World do. It is true, that the Noble <HI>Venetians</HI> are born with &s;ome Character of Sovereignty; be|cau&s;e they compo&s;e the Grand Council, which forms and animates all the other Councils; and on this &s;core they de&s;erve &s;ome con&s;ideration. But after all, this rea&s;on is not &s;atisfactory; for the Nobles of <HI>Genoua</HI> may boa&s;t of the &s;ame Priviledge; Things become of Worth, by the value which is put upon them: And the Noble <HI>Venetians</HI> are di&s;tingui&s;hed, becau&s;e they knew how to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves. They have found it worth their wile, to pu&s;h on the value and honour of their Nobility, be|yond all e&s;timation. They have &s;ometimes compar'd it with that of Princes of Royal Blood. They pretend that it &s;wallows up all the Titles that are a&s;&s;um'd by others:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Henry III.</HI> of <HI>France</HI> recei|ved the Qua|lity of a Noble <HI>Venetian.

See by what methods they arrived to this degree of Honour. Moreover, though there are not two &s;orts of Noblemen at <HI>Venice,</HI> yet they bear not all equally the <HI>Grande &s;up&eacute;rcilium,</HI> which <HI>Juvenal</HI> &s;peaks of; the Commands, the Offices, great Wealth, and ancient Extraction, make new di|&s;tinctions among them. And though, as I told you, they value their Nobility at an infinite rate, yet neverthele&s;s you mu&s;t not from hence conclude, that this Title may

not be communicated for a certain Summ, when the great nece&s;&s;ities of the Republick require it.</P>
<P>The Nobles never appear publickly at <HI>Venice,</HI> but in their Robes of black Cloth; the&s;e they wear at all times, and they ought to be lined with greyi&s;h Cloth in the Win|ter, and Ermins in the Summer. The Stole is of the &s;ame Cloath. The Girdle is black al&s;o, four Fingers broad, and gar|ni&s;hed with Plates and Buckles of Silver; and their Bonnet is only a kind of Cap of black Wor&s;ted, with a little Fringe of the &s;ame: But they wear great Perukes, and commonly carry their Cap in their hands. The Procurators of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> the <HI>Savii grandi,</HI> and the others, who are po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of the highe&s;t Offices, have Habits to di&s;tin|gui&s;h them. Tho&s;e among&s;t the Nobles, who have been Amba&s;&s;adors may wear a Stole of Cloath of Gold, and put Buckles of Gold to their Girdles: But ordinarily they only adorn their black Stoles with a little Gold Galloom. The Phy&s;icians, Ad|vocates, Notaries, and all tho&s;e which are called <HI>Cittadini,</HI> are habited like the Nobles, without any di&s;tinction. It would not al|ways be plea&s;ing to the&s;e to be known by their Habits; for &s;uch a di&s;tinction might expo&s;e them to great dangers, &s;hould any di&s;order happen. They cau&s;e them&s;elves to be treated with <HI>Excellency,</HI> and the man|ner to &s;alute them with great &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion is to ki&s;s their Sleeve. The Elbow of this Sleeve is like a great Sack, and into that,
<PB N="203" REF="127">
tho&s;e who go to Market put their Provi&s;ion. They are not followed by any Servant, and no Per&s;on &s;alutes them, but he who knows them, except tho&s;e who wear the &s;ame Robe. The People fear them and love them but little; but I will not &s;ay that this proceeds from any ill Treatment they re|ceive from them. Friend&s;hip grows com|monly from Conver&s;e; we may then &s;up|po&s;e it is becau&s;e the Nobles make them|&s;elves familiar with no body. They dare not make them&s;elves popular, for fear le&s;t they &s;hould be accu&s;ed of Caballing again&s;t the State. This &s;ame rea&s;on hinders them to vi&s;it each other; and renders them inac|ce&s;&s;ible to Foreigners. You mu&s;t confe&s;s, that this &s;avage and &s;ower Policy is very trouble&s;ome. It is hard that a Govern|ment cannot be happy without de&s;troying the bands and communications of Society, which are the chief Plea&s;ures of this Life! I mu&s;t further tell you, on this Article, that the Nobility is not entail'd to the El|der Sons only, as in <HI>England.</HI> They are not permitted to Trade, nor to marry with Foreigners.</P>
<P>I am not &s;urpris'd at the trouble tho&s;e Titles of Marque&s;&s;es and Counts give you, which you hear &s;poken of in the Countries depending on <HI>Venice.</HI> I will explain the matter to you. The Noble <HI>Venetians</HI> pre|tend to be equal to Princes, but never qua|lifie them&s;elves by any particular Title: And the Marque&s;&s;es and Counts which you tell me of, are no Noblemen of <HI>Venice.</HI>
<PB N="204" REF="128">
The&s;e Gentlemen are of three &s;orts; Some of them really enjoy'd the&s;e Dignities, be|fore they became Subjects to this State, but they have lo&s;t the Priviledges of their Titles, and keep only the Name. They have al|ways taken care at <HI>Venice</HI> to humble them, and to take from them all means of think|ing to &s;hake off the Yoke, or return under the Dominion of their ancient Ma&s;ters; and one of the ways which they have ob|&s;erved for this, hath been to create Counts of a new Stamp, who make head again&s;t the others, and &s;o take away the di&s;tinction by a confu&s;ion of Titles, which have the &s;ame &s;ound. The other advantages which <HI>Venice</HI> draws from this Invention, would make here too long a digre&s;&s;ion; only I have inform'd you what are the Mar|que&s;&s;es and Counts of the &s;econd Order. Tho&s;e of the third are founded on &s;ome Preten&s;ions of their Ance&s;tors. If they were not altogether Counts, in the time of the ancient Government, they had at lea&s;t a great de&s;ire to be &s;o. And when the face of Affairs was chang'd, they made them&s;elves Counts, I know not how, with|out any endeavours u&s;ed to hinder them, becau&s;e they got no real advantage by it.</P>
<P>I find that you are misinform'd in &s;ome particulars relating to the Duke. You mu&s;t conceive, that the Duke, con&s;i|dered as Duke, is but a meer Figure of a Prince, an animated Statue, and a Chi|mera of Greatne&s;s. It puts me in mind of tho&s;e Two Per&s;ons which at the Co|ronation

of your Kings, bear the Name of the Dukes of <HI>Aquitain</HI> and <HI>Normandy.</HI> It is &s;o far out of the Duke's Power to Par|don any Criminal, as you have been per|&s;uaded, that you may a&s;&s;ure your &s;elf his new Quality dimini&s;heth his Credit very much, if it doth not ab&s;olutely reduce it to nothing. It is true, that the Duke is encompa&s;&s;ed with many Marks of Honour, but none of tho&s;e properly relate to him: They belong only to his Repre&s;entative Quality, like the Privilege which Amba&s;|&s;adors have to be cover'd when they &s;peak to Kings to whom they are &s;ent. The Duke is the Repre&s;entative of the Repub|lick, who&s;e plea&s;ure it is to reflect its Glory upon him, as it were to ea&s;e it &s;elf of the trouble of it; yet appropriating to it &s;elf all the Honours he receives. And tho&s;e Honours which the Quality of Duke brings with it, fall not upon him who is in|ve&s;ted with it, but to be immediately transfer'd to the State, which &s;eems to have only &s;et him up for this Purpo&s;e. This is &s;o true, that to hinder the Duke from abu|&s;ing tho&s;e Honours which are only to pa&s;s from him, as through a Canal, they give him Coun&s;ellors, who have a con&s;tant Eye over him, and can vi&s;it his Clo&s;et every Hour. He cannot take a Journey to the Continent, without permi&s;&s;ion of the State; and when he goes, tho' with leave, all his Honours vani&s;h there, and he hath no more Authority than another Noble-man. From the fir&s;t Moment of his Election,
<PB N="206" REF="130">
all his Kindred who were in Offices are immediately turn'd out: And when he dies, the State wears no Mourning. See, Sir, what <HI>Idea</HI> you ought to have of the Duke of <HI>Venice.</HI> I will farther add, that if, maugre all the Care they take to curb his Power, he &s;hould endeavour to break out beyond his Sphere, &s;uch Orders are ta|ken as would pre&s;ently re&s;train him. The Duke is as much &s;ubject to the Laws, as the meane&s;t Per&s;on; and the Inqui&s;ition of the State is a Scourge, which &s;eems to threaten him more particularly than o|thers. I &s;uppo&s;e you are acquainted with the unlimited Power of this Tribunal, which you mu&s;t reckon to be as rigorous and &s;evere, as the other Inqui&s;ition at <HI>Ve|nice</HI> is patient, and free from rigour and &s;everity.</P>
<P>To return to the Duke: You mu&s;t know, that notwith&s;tanding all his Slave|ry, and his little Authority, his Quality of Duke allows him two or Three &s;mall Pri|vileges. He hath two Voices in the great Council: He be&s;tows the little Offices of the Palace; and he hath the Nomination of the <HI>Primicerio,</HI> and Canons of St. <HI>Mark.</HI> As for his other Honours, they are given to the Republick, in the Per&s;on of the Duke. In this &s;ence he is call'd <HI>Prince,</HI> and treated with <HI>Serenity,</HI> which is a term of Honour above that of <HI>Highne&s;s,</HI> according to their Interpretation. There are &s;ome Marks of Royalty in his Apparel. When he marches in State, they carry a Torch
<PB N="207" REF="130">
before him,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">This Chair hath two Arms, and no Back.</NOTE> a Folding Chair, the Cu&s;hi|on which belongs to it, and Eight Silver Trumpets, &s;ome Hoboys, and Eight Stan|dards, on which are the Arms of <HI>Venice:</HI> There are Two White, Two Red, Two Violet, and Two Blue, which, 'tis &s;aid, &s;ignifie Peace, War, Truce, and the League. They made us take notice, that the Two Red ones marched fir&s;t; be|cau&s;e the Republick was at pre&s;ent in War. When it was at Peace, the White ones have the precedency; and &s;o the re&s;t in order. They carry al&s;o near the Duke, a kind of Cloth of State, made like an Um|brello. The Duke is ordinarily accompa|nied with the <HI>Nuncio,</HI> and the other Am|ba&s;&s;adors which are at <HI>Venice,</HI> except the Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>Spain,</HI> who never a&s;&s;i&s;ts at any publick Ceremony, &s;ince this State gave the Precedency to the Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>France.</HI> The&s;e Mini&s;ters have their Hats on their Heads. As for the Duke, he never pulls off his Coronet but on one of the&s;e two Oc|ca&s;ions; either at the moment when the Ho&s;t is elevated, or when he receives a Vi&s;it from a Prince of Royal Blood, or from a Cardinal. I mu&s;t tell you, that the Cardinal &s;its in the &s;ame great Chair with the Duke; this Chair having a Spring and Machine made on purpo&s;e to let it out &s;o as Two may &s;it together: The Duke gives the Right-hand to the Cardinal. But to return to the Proce&s;&s;ion: The Principal Senators march after, and the Sword of State is carried before them, to
<PB N="208" REF="131">
denote that the Authority re&s;ides in the Council, not in the Duke. I am not well enough inform'd of the particulars of the re&s;t of this Proce&s;&s;ion, to give you an exact De&s;cription of it; but it is not very material. I mu&s;t farther acquaint you, that the Money bears the Name of the Duke: That the Letters of the Confede|rate Princes and States are addre&s;&s;ed to him: That he gives Audience to Amba&s;|&s;adors, and that Declarations are publi&s;h'd in his Name. The&s;e la&s;t Particulars need &s;ome Explanation: The Name of the Duke is, in truth, on the Money, but his Arms are not; and his Image is there only Hi&s;torically. This Money is pro|perly the Coin of <HI>Venice.</HI> On the Rever&s;e is the Duke on his Knees, at the Foot of the <HI>Primicerio,</HI> who &s;its and repre&s;ents St. <HI>Mark.</HI> The Duke takes an Oath of Fidelity to him, having one Hand on the Ma&s;s-Book, and with the other re|ceiving the Banner of the State. By this you may perceive that this is no Honour to the Duke; and that his Image has no more Marks of Authority than that of the <HI>Primicerio.</HI> As for the Letters of Princes, the truth is, they are directed and pre&s;ented to the Duke; but it be|longs not to him to open them, with|out fir&s;t communicating them to the Coun|cil; that is to &s;ay, the Council receives them by his Hands. And it is much the &s;ame thing with re&s;pect to Amba&s;&s;adors; For the Affair is con&s;ulted before, and the
<PB N="209" REF="131">
An&s;wer is &s;o well put, Word for Word, into the Mouth of the Duke, that if any of them happen to forget, or perhaps to make a willing Mi&s;take, they are a&s;toni|&s;hed to find them&s;elves corrected on the Spot. As to what concerns Acts of State, he is but tht Herald; the Senate enacts, and the Duke publi&s;hes.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t then be confe&s;&s;ed, that if in any ca&s;e Gold and Purple are but glaring Page|ants; and if the Grandeurs of the World are but Chimera's and &s;tately Yokes; the Duke of <HI>Venice</HI> is an Eminent In&s;tance of the&s;e Truths.</P>
<P>I have, in obedience to your De&s;ire, in&s;i&s;ted the longer on this Particular: Do not think that I have reveal'd to you any My&s;tery, in the things which I have &s;aid of the Duke: Though they are not conformable to the <HI>Idea's</HI> you had conceiv'd, nor, perhaps, to tho&s;e of the greate&s;t part of the World; they are all generally known here.<NOTE PLACE="marg">See what Mr. <HI>Amelot</HI> hath written of it.</NOTE> I will not med|dle with the Article of Government, that would be too tedious and difficult a Subject for me to undertake; who nei|ther have Time, nor Intelligence &s;uffi|cient to be fully in&s;tructed in &s;o many things.</P>
<P>I will briefly an&s;wer your Que&s;tions concerning the Patriarch. He is elected by the Senate, and confirmed by the Pope; and his Quality gives him, as you may believe, a very eminent Rank; but his Authority is extreamly bounded. The

It is al|&s;o incredible how much Ignorance and Di&s;|order reigns in this Country, among all tho&s;e who call them&s;elves Clergy-men. The Cardinal <HI>Barberigo,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Padua,</HI> who is a venerable Old Man, and a wi&s;e Per&s;on, &s;ometimes take the Pains, as they &s;ay at <HI>Padua,</HI> to preach him&s;elf again&s;t the&s;e Abu&s;es. He introduces as much as he can, the Cu&s;tom to make the Prie&s;ts under&s;tand a little <HI>Latin.</HI> And his Zeal hath extended &s;o far as to double the Grates of &s;ome Nunneries in his Dioce&s;s,

<P>THere is not any thing worth Ob|&s;ervation between <HI>Padua</HI> and <HI>Rovi|go,</HI> only that the Country is Plain and Fruitful, watered with many Rivers, and well cultivated. It is every where full of Meadows, Groves, Vineyards, and well|till'd Spots of Ground. The <HI>Venetians</HI> have there &s;ome Hou&s;es of Plea&s;ure; but the common Habitations, when you draw

near to <HI>Rovigo,</HI> are but Huts made of Reeds, which a Fire would reduce to A&s;hes in le&s;s than an Hour; yet are they as merry there as in a Palace. We &s;aw often come out of the&s;e Cabbins, whole Troops of Maskers, dancing Gambols to the Tunes of the Violin and Bagpipe. The&s;e Country Crews perhaps are to be preferred before the Rabble of <HI>Venice.</HI></P>

the&s;e old Princes are con&s;trained to do a great deal of Work in a little time, to en|rich their Families; they care little what becomes of the E&s;tate after their Death. When <HI>Ferrara</HI> was united to their Deme&s;nes, under the Pontificat of <HI>Clement</HI> VIII. that Pope built a very &s;trong<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Du Val</HI> writes, that this Cita|del co&s;t Two Millions of Crowns of Gold.</NOTE> Citadel, which is &s;till in good Order. As for the other Fortifications, they are wholly &s;lighted. The ancient Univer&s;ity of <HI>Ferrara</HI> is at pre|&s;ent reduced to a paltry College of the <HI>Je|&s;uits.</HI></P>
<P>Near the Cathedral, there are &s;ome Sta|tues on Hor&s;e-back, of Bra&s;s, of which one, they &s;ay, repre&s;ents a Duke of <HI>Boz|zolo.</HI> Over-again&s;t the Palace of the No|bility, you &s;ee al&s;o the Statue of Duke <HI>Her|cules</HI> II. on Hor&s;e-back; on the Pede&s;tal of which, there is a Decree engraved, which grants a Refuge or Sanctuary to Crimi|nals for Twenty Paces round about.</P>
<P>They carried us to the Ducal Palace, to the Marquis <HI>de Villa</HI>'s Hou&s;e, to the Ca|thedral, and many other Churches and Convents. But tho' all the&s;e places have their own Beauties, I believe the De&s;cripti|on of 'em would not be very plea&s;ant to you; yet will I not forget to &s;end you the Epitaph of poor <HI>Ario&s;to:</HI> They have lately repaired his Tomb in the Church of the <HI>Benedictines.</HI></P>

<P>They carried us al&s;o to the Opera, where we &s;aw nothing extraordinary. The prin|cipal Actre&s;s was a little pretty Song&s;tre&s;s, of Twelve or Thirteen Years old; who that day was to make the fir&s;t E&s;&s;ay on the Theatre; and according to common Report, was that Evening to enter into the Service of one of the principal Gentle|men of the City.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">RAVENNA.</NOTE>It is fifty Miles from <HI>Ferrara</HI> to <HI>Raven|na;</HI> the Way continues good for the fir&s;t Day's Journey, but afterwards becomes low, and full of Water, between the &s;e|veral Branches of the <HI>Adige</HI> and the <HI>Po.</HI> The Towns and Villages which we &s;aw on the Road, de&s;erve not to be mentio|ned. <HI>Ravenna</HI> is but half as big as <HI>Ferrara,</HI> yet it appears at a great di&s;tance, being &s;i|tuated in a flat and open Champion Coun|try. You are not ignorant that the anci|ent Geographers repre&s;ent its Situation like to that of <HI>Venice,</HI> upon Piles in the mid&s;t of Waters. And all the World knows that it was formerly<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Cla&s;&s;em My|&s;eni alterum Ravennae ad tutelam &s;uperi &amp; inferi ma|ris. <HI>Suet. in Octav. c.</HI> 49.</NOTE> the Principal Haven which the <HI>Romans</HI> had on the <HI>Adriatick</HI> Gulf: But this Place hath &s;uffer'd great Alterations &s;ince tho&s;e times; for not only the <HI>Lagunes</HI> are dried up, but the Sea is al&s;o retired
<PB N="217" REF="135">
Three Miles from it; and the&s;e Plains, formerly drown'd and barren, are at pre|&s;ent the mo&s;t fruitful Fields in <HI>Italy.</HI> It is not to be doubted but that the pre&s;ent <HI>Ravenna</HI> is in the place of the ancient <HI>Ra|venna;</HI> as it appears evidently from &s;everal ancient Monuments. There are in the Walls towards the Sea-&s;ide, many great Rings of Iron, which formerly &s;er|ved to fa&s;ten the Ve&s;&s;els: And you may yet &s;ee the remainders of the Beacon. This City hath been &s;o often ruin'd by the Wars, that there are but few Marks left of its fir&s;t Antiquity: It is at pre&s;ent poorly built, and very thinly peopled, as well as <HI>Ferrara;</HI> neverthele&s;s I found it in many things worthy of Ob&s;ervation. Its Situation alone, in re&s;pect of the wonder|ful Change which hath happen'd in its Ter|ritory, I think de&s;erves a Man's travelling this way.</P>
<P>Without the Walls, near the ancient Haven, there is a <HI>Mau&s;olaeum,</HI> which <HI>Amu|la&s;untha</HI> erected for her Father <HI>Theodoric,</HI> King of the <HI>O&s;trogoths;</HI> who, as you know, made his Re&s;idence at <HI>Ravenna.</HI> They have turned this Building into a little Church, which they call the <HI>Rotonda.</HI> The mo&s;t remarkable thing about it is, the hewn Stone with which this Church is cover'd: I mea&s;ured this Stone, and found it to be thirty eight Foot in Diameter, and fifteen in Thickne&s;s. The Tomb of <HI>Theo|doric</HI> was on the top, in the mid&s;t of this little Dome, between the Statues of the
<PB N="218" REF="136">
Twelve Apo&s;tles, which were placed on the &s;ides round about. The&s;e Statues were broken during the la&s;t Wars of <HI>Louis</HI> XII. and the Tomb which is of <HI>Porphyrie,</HI> was al&s;o over-thrown: They have &s;ince &s;et it in the Wall of an Ancient Palace in the City, where we &s;aw it.</P>
<P>The Cathedral is an old Church, the Body of which is &s;upported by fifty &s;ix Pil|lars of Marble, of the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> which make a double Range on each &s;ide. The Choir is vaulted with fine <HI>Mo&s;aick;</HI> and they keep there in great Veneration, one of the Stones with which St. <HI>Stephen</HI> was &s;toned. But the greate&s;t Curio&s;ity in this Church is the great Door: It is made of Planks of Vines, &s;ome whereof are twelve Foot high, and fourteen or fifteen Inches broad. The Ground hereabouts is &s;o a|greeable to the Vines, in that very place which the Sea formerly covered, that it makes them grow prodigiou&s;ly big. I have read, as I remember, in the Voyage of <HI>Olearius,</HI> that he found near the <HI>Ca&s;pi|an</HI> Sea, the Bodies of Vines of the thick|ne&s;s of a Man.</P>
<P>They &s;hew in the Church of the <HI>Thea|tines,</HI> a little Window over the great Al|tar, in the mid&s;t of which is the Figure of a White Pigeon, which is placed there for a Memorial; that after the death of St. <HI>Apollinarius,</HI> fir&s;t Bi&s;hop of <HI>Ravenna,</HI> the Prie&s;ts being a&s;&s;embled to choo&s;e his Suc|ce&s;&s;or, the Holy Gho&s;t, as they &s;ay, came in at that Window in the Shape of a
<PB N="219" REF="136">
Dove, and perch'd upon him who was to be Elected: They add, that the &s;ame thing happen'd Eleven times after, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively; but &s;ince that time, they have done their Bu&s;ine&s;s without &s;uper-natural a&s;&s;i&s;tance. <HI>Platina</HI> after <HI>Eu&s;ebius,</HI> tells the like Story of the Election of Pope <HI>Fabian.</HI></P>
<P>There are very fine Pieces of <HI>Marble</HI> and <HI>Porphyrie</HI> in the Churches of St. <HI>Vital,</HI> St. <HI>Apollinarius,</HI> St. <HI>Romualdus,</HI> and St. <HI>An|drew;</HI> all the&s;e were brought from <HI>Greece,</HI> and probably during the time of the <HI>Ex|archie.</HI></P>

<P>There is in the grand <HI>Place</HI> a very fair Brazen Statue of Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> VII.

<P>A good Hour from <HI>Ravenna</HI> we entred into a Fore&s;t of Pines, which is Four Miles long, and who&s;e Pine-Apples, they told us, are di&s;tributed all over <HI>Italy.</HI> The Sea is not far off, on the Left-hand; and on the Right are tho&s;e Mar&s;hes, which reach out of &s;ight towards the <HI>Ap|pennine.</HI> After we had pa&s;&s;ed the River
<PB N="221" REF="137">
<HI>Savio</HI> in a Ferry-Boat, we travers'd the little City of <HI>Cervia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CERVIA.</NOTE> which is in the mid&s;t of a mi&s;erable Boggy Country, where they make nothing but Salt. We &s;topp'd to Dine at <HI>Ce&s;enate,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ce&s;enate.</NOTE> on the Sea-&s;ide; and Three Miles from thence we found our &s;elves on the Banks of the <HI>Ru|bicon,</HI> which they al&s;o call<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Others &s;ay this is the <HI>Frumicino,</HI> about Two hun|dred Paces from the <HI>Pi&s;a|tello.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Pi&s;atello.</HI> I confe&s;s I was not a little &s;urpri&s;ed when I &s;aw our Coach pa&s;s that famous Brook without any &s;top; tho' I had learned al&s;o from <HI>Lucan,</HI> that it was no great River.</P>
<Q>Fonte cadit modico, parvi&s;&abque; impellitur undis.</Q>
<P>An Hour after we took our way by the Sea-&s;ide. The Sand is firm and even, without any Rocks or Shells: We pur&s;u'd this Way till within a Mile of <HI>Rimini;</HI> where we were oblig'd to go within Land, that we might pa&s;s the River formerly called <HI>Ariminum,</HI> of the &s;ame Name with the City who&s;e Walls it wa&s;hes: But at pre&s;ent it bears the name of <HI>Marechia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rimini</HI> is a little poor City;<NOTE PLACE="marg">RIMINI.</NOTE> yet the Country is rich, and well till'd. <HI>Sigi&s;mond Pandolphus Malate&s;ta</HI> formerly fortified it; but its Wall is at pre&s;ent in great di&s;or|der. You know the <HI>Malate&s;ti's</HI> were for|merly Lords of many places in this Pro|vince. The Bridge of Marble, on which there are two very entire In&s;criptions, by which it appears that it was built by <HI>Au|gu&s;tus</HI> and <HI>Tiberius,</HI> and the Triumphal-Arch erected by <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> are the two principal
<PB N="222" REF="138">
Monuments of this City. There are al&s;o to be &s;een the Ruiues of an Amphithea|tre, behind the Gardens of the <HI>Capuchins.</HI> And Five hundred Paces farther, with|out the City, there is a Tower of Brick, which was the <HI>Pharos</HI> of the ancient Ha|ven; but the Sea is fallen back half a Mile from this Place, and the <HI>Pharos</HI> is at pre|&s;ent encompa&s;&s;ed with Gardens. <HI>P. Ma|late&s;ta</HI> fini&s;hed the De&s;truction of the Har|bour, which was once accounted one of the be&s;t in <HI>Italy,</HI> to build the Church of St. <HI>Francis,</HI> with the Pieces of Marble which he took from thence. This Church, were it fini&s;h'd, might pa&s;s for a fine Structure. They keep there a <HI>No&s;tre-dame,</HI> which &s;erves for nothing but to bring Rain, or &s;top it, when there is either too much or too lit|tle. She never is asked any thing but on one of the&s;e two Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>The Library of the Count <HI>de Gambalon|ga</HI> is very numerous, but there are no Ra|rities in it, if we may give credit to him who &s;howed it to us. They made us ob|&s;erve in the mid&s;t of the Market, a kind of Marble Pede&s;tal, on which the&s;e words are engraved: <HI>Caius Cae&s;ar Dict. Rubicone &s;u|perato civili bell. Commilit. &s;uos hic in foro Ar. adlocutus.</HI> The Statue of <HI>Paul</HI> V. in Bra&s;s, is in another Place; and near to that a Fountain of Marble of excellent Workman|&s;hip.</P>
<P>Departing from <HI>Rimini,</HI> we march'd on the Downs for Fifteen Miles, between the Sea and the Fields. I ob&s;erv'd as we pa&s;|&s;ed
<PB N="223" REF="138">
thro' the Village <HI>Catholica,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Catholica.</NOTE> over the Portal of the great Church, an In&s;cripti|on, which &s;ays, That a Council of Bi|&s;hops, almo&s;t all <HI>Arrians,</HI> being a&s;&s;embled at <HI>Rimini,</HI> in the Year 359, the Ortho|dox perform'd their Devotions in this Vil|lage, which hath ever &s;ince born the Name of <HI>Catholica.</HI> You know the Hi&s;tory of this Council, if it may be properly &s;o call'd. We perceived Ten or Twelve Miles from thence, towards the <HI>Appennine,</HI> the City and Republick of <HI>Marin;</HI> on the top of a Mountain, at the Foot of which are the Limits of that State. This little Swarm of Bees hath maintained it &s;elf very happily for many Ages; not be|ing expos'd to the Envy or Jealou&s;ie of any of its Neighbours. It is about Six or Seven Miles from <HI>Catholica</HI> to <HI>Pe&s;aro:</HI> All this Country is &s;trewed with fine Hou&s;es, and is very plea&s;antly cultivated.</P>
<P><HI>Pe&s;aro</HI> is greater, better built,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PESARO.</NOTE> neater and plea&s;anter than <HI>Rimini:</HI> Its Situation is up|on a &s;mall A&s;cent, which gives it a purer Air, and better Light: Nothing can be more plea&s;ant than the little Hills which &s;urround it: It is a delicate Mixture of Pa&s;tures, Vineyards, and Orchards: The Olives are admirable; but the Figs in good|ne&s;s and e&s;teem &s;urpa&s;s all other Fruits: The Figs of <HI>Pe&s;aro</HI> are famous over all <HI>Italy.</HI> The be&s;t Meat co&s;ts not above three <HI>Bayoques</HI> the Pound, which is Eigh|teen Ounces; that is to &s;ay, &s;omewhat le&s;s than two Farthings. The Bread and the
<PB N="224" REF="139">
Wine are proportionably cheaper; and &s;o of the re&s;t. The Sea and the Rivers furni&s;h it al&s;o with all &s;orts of excellent Fi&s;h; &s;o that in all re&s;pects this City is excellently pro|vided with all things nece&s;&s;ary for Life. It is tolerably well fortified, tho' &s;omething after the old fa&s;hion; and the Hou&s;es are generally hand&s;ome. We found no old Monuments in it. There is a very fair Fountain in the great <HI>Place;</HI> and a Statue of Pope <HI>Urban</HI> VIII. under who&s;e Pontifi|cat, this City, and all the Dutchy of <HI>Urbin,</HI> were re-united to the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical State.</P>
<P>At our departure from <HI>Pe&s;aro,</HI> we coa&s;t|ed along the Shore for Seven Miles, as far as <HI>Fano:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">FANO.</NOTE> It continues, &s;till as I repre&s;ented it on the other &s;ide of <HI>Rimini,</HI> excepting that the Sea brings thither great Heaps of Walnuts, Che&s;nuts, Ru&s;hes, Leaves, and divers other things which probably come from the Rivers, and are driven back from time to time by the Wind. One of our Company found on the <HI>Strand</HI> one of tho&s;e little Fi&s;hes which they call in this Coun|try <HI>Cavaletto;</HI> &s;ome call it in <HI>France, Che|val Marin,</HI> or the Sea-Hor&s;e; and others the <HI>Little Dragon.</HI> I have often &s;een it in the Cabinets of Curio&s;ities; and I believe you al&s;o know it. It becomes drie in a little time, by which means it is ea&s;ily pre|&s;erved, without farther trouble. It is cer|tain this little Creature hath &s;omething of the Head and Neck of a Hor&s;e. They at|tribute many Properties to it; and they
<PB N="225" REF="139">
a&s;&s;ured us, among&s;t other things, that it cures Madne&s;s from biting by a Mad-Dog, being eaten roa&s;ted, and applied to the bitten place, skinned and beaten with Honey and Vinegar.</P>
<P><HI>Fano</HI> is a pretty little City: We found nothing remarkable in it but one Trium|phal-Arch; the In&s;criptions of which are almo&s;t quite defaced. This Arch hath Three Gates, whereas that of <HI>Rimini</HI> is on|ly a &s;ingle Arch. They boa&s;t of the Pig|nuts of <HI>Fano;</HI> and pretend that the Wo|men there are the hand&s;ome&s;t of all the Country; but I fan&s;ie this pretended dif|ference may be a little &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>A Mile from hence, we pa&s;&s;ed on a Wooden Bridge, about Five or Six hun|dred Paces long, over the &s;everal Branches of the <HI>Pongio,</HI> which drowns all this Ex|tent, when the Snow on the <HI>Appennine</HI> begins to melt: And afterwards we took the Way on the Sea &s;ide, for Fifteen Miles, to <HI>Senegallia.</HI> Tho' this be an old City,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SENEGAL|LIA.</NOTE> yet could we find no Marks of its Anti|quity; it is enclo&s;ed with good Walls, which are defended by &s;ome Ba&s;tions, but all very irregular.</P>
<P>By good fortune, and rather becau&s;e of our wearine&s;s than any thing el&s;e, we re|fu&s;ed to go to &s;ee a Play, which was act|ed at the Governour's Hou&s;e. The next Morning, which was the Day before Ye|&s;terday, they came to tell us, that a little before the end of the Play, the Arch which &s;upported the Theatre, with part of
<PB N="226" REF="140">
the Stage, and the fir&s;t Seats, fell under the weight with which it was over-loaded: That thirty Per&s;ons were killed on the &s;pot, and a great many others wounded; and all that little City was in a great di&s;order, and un&s;peakable affliction on this occa&s;ion: There &s;carcely being any con&s;iderable Fa|mily which had not its &s;hare of this mis|fortune.</P>
<P>Departing from <HI>Senegallia,</HI> we entred a|gain on the Shore, and travelled &s;eventeen Miles, without finding any Hou&s;es but an old Ca&s;tle, and &s;ome Taverns about an hundred paces from the Sea. Near the little Village called the Turret, we fell back into the Land-way for three Miles to <HI>Ancona,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ANCONA.</NOTE> where we now are. This City is &s;eated on a double Hillock, at the point of the Pro|montory. It is bigger than any one of the four or five Towns la&s;t mention'd, but not much richer; though its Haven be very good,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Traders of all Religions may dwell at <HI>An|cona,</HI> provided they make no publick Exerci&s;e of any, be&s;ides the Religion of the Country.

<P>'Tis true, that after the like example of <HI>Antwerp,</HI> we ought not to be &s;urpris'd at any accidents of this nature.

it very inconvenient. The Citadel, which is on the fir&s;t a&s;cent you come to, commands both the City and the Haven. And on the other Hill which makes the point of the Cape, is the Church of St. <HI>Cy|riack,</HI> to which we a&s;cended with a great deal of trouble and little &s;atisfaction. It is a low and dark Edifice, of which the Front is cover'd indeed with fine Marble, but without any order or ornament of Archi|tecture. That which is principally e&s;teem'd in this Church by the People of the Coun|try, are the Bodies of the pretended Saints, and the number of Relicks. They boa&s;t they have St. <HI>Ur&s;ula,</HI> as well as tho&s;e of <HI>Cologne.</HI> As for us, what plea&s;ed us be&s;t, was the pro&s;pect which we had of the Sea, of the City, and of a plea&s;ant Country. At the entrance of the Mote there is a Tri|umphal-Arch of very fine white Marble. This Arch was erected for <HI>Trajan,</HI> by order of the Senate. The In&s;cription, which is &s;till very entire, let us know, that it was in acknowledgment of this, that that Prince repair'd the Harbour at his own charge. They told us, whil&s;t we were con&s;idering this Monument, that, I know not what Monks had oftentimes earne&s;tly reque&s;ted, that they might employ the Materials for &s;ome u&s;e in their Convent: And that at la&s;t they were fain to drive them away with Threats, to be rid of their Impor|tunity.</P>

<P>I cannot forbear giving you &s;ome ac|count of the Habits, which, thanks to the Holy-day, we &s;aw here to day. The prin|cipal Burge&s;&s;es u&s;ually wear a black Cloak, lined with green; blue or fillamott Stock|ings, Shoes whited with Chalk, and tied with coloured Ribbon; the Doublets un|button'd, adorn'd with Embroidery of &s;e|veral Colours, and great Sleeves to their Shirts, which hang down to their Fingers ends. The ordinary Citizens Wives and Daughters wear a kind of Coif on their Heads, with a long Fringe which covers their Faces, and drives away the Flies like Hor&s;e-trappings. The body of their Gown is red or yellow, fa&s;tned on four &s;ides with Laces, and all overlaid with coloured Ga|loon: The Wa&s;tcoat &s;hort, their Petticoats of the &s;ame &s;ize, and all of fifty Colours: The great Madams are deck'd and trimm'd up as much as they can after the <HI>French</HI> Mode: But to &s;ay truth, their Api&s;hne&s;s is more ridiculous than the others natural Dre&s;&s;ing. All this does neither good nor hurt; but there is another Cu&s;tom which, as we were inform'd, runs from <HI>Ferrara</HI> al|mo&s;t all over <HI>Italy,</HI> and is very inconvenient, e&s;pecially at this time of the Year.

Mile further to the &s;ame Hill, on which it now &s;tands: but it was no &s;ooner come thither, than a Controver&s;ie aro&s;e between two Brothers to whom the Land belonged, each being willing to have it in his Lot. This was the cau&s;e, that four Months af|terwards the Angels lifted it up the fourth time, and placed it &s;ome paces from thence, in the very mid&s;t of the Road-way; from whence it hath never &s;tirred &s;ince. It is true, to prevent the inconveniencies to which this place, as well as the others, ex|po&s;ed it, and perhaps al&s;o to prevent the misfortune of a new change: They built in this very place a magnificent Church, in the mid&s;t whereof it remains free from all manner of In&s;ults or Injury. And for its better pre&s;ervation, they have &s;ince e|rected four Walls, which encompa&s;s it, and clo&s;e it up as in a Box, without touch|ing it at all, for fear, le&s;t the two Walls being united, they &s;hould one day be con|founded together. Some alledge another rea&s;on of this Seperation; and &s;ay, That the Stones recoiled with violence, and woun|ded the Work-men, when they would have joined it to this Holy Building; &s;o that they were con&s;trained to leave &s;ome &s;pace between them. All the beauties of Pain|tings, Sculpture, and Architecture, were di&s;play'd on that occa&s;ion; or at lea&s;t all the mo&s;t curious Workmen in the begin|ning of the la&s;t Age, were employed in this Work. It is of <HI>Corinthian</HI> Order, and of white Marble of <HI>Carrara,</HI> with extraordi|nary
<PB N="233" REF="143">
fine <HI>Ba&s;&s;o relievo's,</HI> in which all the Hi&s;tory of the Virgin is repre&s;ented: There are al&s;o two Niches, the one above the other, between the double Columns. In the ten Niches below, are the Statues of the ten Prophets, and in the Niches above, the ten <HI>Sybils.</HI></P>
<P>It is within this that the <HI>Santa Ca&s;a</HI> is enclos'd, which con&s;i&s;ts of one only Cham|ber, or rather one &s;ingle Hall. It is forty four Palms long within, eighteen broad, and thirteen high; a Palm and an half making ju&s;t thirteen Inches, <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> mea|&s;ure.</P>
<P>They would have tho&s;e very People who live on the place, believe, that this Hou&s;e is built of &s;ome unknown Stones, to make its Voyages &s;eem more probable; but this is an ab&s;urdity that can only be &s;wallow'd by &s;uch as are willing to be deceiv'd. I ex|amin'd the thing twice very nearly, and at lei&s;ure. 'Tis true, they have purpo&s;ely made choice of Bricks of different &s;hapes and unequal bigne&s;s, yet I perceiv'd very di&s;tinctly, that the&s;e Walls are made of Brick, and true Brick; together with &s;ome flat and greyi&s;h or reddi&s;h Stones, which are all common. The whole is built with Lime and Sand, as our ordinary Hou&s;es, but the Pieces are ill joyned, and ill ranged, which &s;eems to evince, that this work was done in ha&s;te.</P>
<P>I will here make a little digre&s;&s;ion, to acquaint you with a thought which comes in my Head concerning it. It was under

the Popedom of <HI>Boniface</HI> VIII. that this pretended Miracle happen'd<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><P>It is he who, they &s;ay, rais'd him&s;elf to the Papal Dignity like a Fox, liv'd like a Lion, and dy'd like a Dog.</P>
<P>It was he who invented, and fir&s;t wore the Triple Crown. <HI>Intravit ut vulpes, reg|navit ut leo, mortuus ut canis.</HI></P></NOTE>. And if you make any reflection on the Life of that famous <HI>Fox,</HI> which all Hi&s;tories repre&s;ent to us as the mo&s;t Cunning, the mo&s;t Am|bitious, and mo&s;t Covetous of all the Men in the World, and add to the&s;e Con&s;idera|tions, that of his Power and Authority, you will grant, without difficulty, that he was a Man fit to undertake &s;uch a Cheat as this: After he had feigned Angels who frighted the good Man <HI>Cele&s;tin,</HI> his Prede|ce&s;&s;or, and obliged him to return to his Hermitage, after his Abdication of the Popedom: And it is not at all improbable, that he made u&s;e of the &s;ame Angels for the Expedition of <HI>Loretto.</HI> But let us re|turn to the <HI>Santa Ca&s;a.</HI></P>
<P>You may comprehend, by what I have &s;aid, that you cannot &s;ee the out&s;ide; and con&s;equently what I &s;peak of mu&s;t be within. The Ma&s;on's Work is almo&s;t all open to view, but there are &s;ome frag|ments of Plai&s;ter covered with Painting, which might make one gue&s;s, that all the Walls were cover'd with it. The Image of the Virgin holding the little <HI>Je&s;us</HI> between her Arms, appear in five or &s;ix places in the remainders of the Painting. This Holy Tabernacle is &s;ituated from <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> to <HI>We&s;t,</HI> though this manner of building Churches is but little in fa&s;hion in <HI>Italy:</HI> Towards the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> is the little Chimney of the Chamber, and over it, in a Nich, is the great Lady of <HI>Loretto.</HI> They &s;ay this Image of our

<P>On each &s;ide of the Niche, there are Pre&s;&s;es full of ancient Ornaments of the Statue; and in the other little Window, which is made in the Wall on the <HI>South</HI> &s;ide, they pre&s;erve &s;ome earthen Di&s;hes, which &s;erv'd for the u&s;e of the Holy Family. There are many of the&s;e Ve&s;&s;els which have been &s;ince cover'd with Plates of Gold; but we could &s;ee but one of 'em, which is cover'd underneath with Silver. They would make us believe, that this Porringer, which might have been di&s;cover'd by the bottom, is made of &s;trange Earth, but it is Potter's-Ware, the Enamel of which is not &s;o carefully par'd off, but that it appears &s;till in &s;ome parts. Over again&s;t our Lady, at the end which looks <HI>We&s;tward,</HI> is the Window at which they &s;ay the Angel entred. This Window &s;eemed to me about three foot in heighth, and a little le&s;s in breadth.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="146">They could not tell me what was be|come of the old Roof, nor the little Bell, which hath been ob&s;erved in the ancient Pictures which repre&s;ent this Hou&s;e: For the pre&s;ent Arch is of a later Fabrick.

<P>I mu&s;t not forget two con&s;iderable things, which, they &s;ay, were tran&s;ported at the &s;ame time with the Hou&s;e: the Altar made by the hands of the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves, and the Stone on which St. <HI>Peter</HI> celebrated his fir&s;t Ma&s;s. This is covered with Silver, and hath place among the Relicks, under the Altar where they u&s;ually officiate. The Pavement is of &s;quares of white and red Marble. This is not the old Floor, for, they &s;ay, the Angels left that at <HI>Nazareth,</HI> with the Foundations of the Hou&s;e. To prove this Hi&s;tory of the Tran&s;lation, they in&s;i&s;t on this Argument, that, as they af|firm, it appears, that it really hath no Foundation, but was fixed on the Earth, ju&s;t as it fell from Heaven.</P>

<P>I will not undertake to repre&s;ent to you the Riches which are in this place: For that would be a thing too tedious and diffi|cult. I will only tell you, that it is an a|mazing &s;ight to behold the infinite number of precious Stones, with which the Mantle of the Statue is adorn'd; there is nothing all about but Lamps, Statues, Bu&s;ts, and other Figures of Gold and Silver: without mentioning the Candle&s;ticks of Silver and Vermillion, which are eight and twenty in number, there are twelve of ma&s;&s;ie Gold, of &s;even and thirty pound weight each. The la&s;t rich Offering is always left for &s;ome time in a place fram'd on purpo&s;e, before the Eyes of our Lady: That which at pre&s;ent occupies that honourable place, is an Angel of Gold, holding a Heart bigger than an Egg, all covered over with Dia|monds of great value.

He &s;aid, the Son was not yet born, and therefore ought not be called <HI>Natum:</HI> And that he could not think it po&s;&s;ible, the Name <HI>Natus</HI> or <HI>Filius</HI> &s;hould be given to an Embryo of half a Minute, or at lea&s;t to the informed matter of a <HI>Foetus.</HI> But the Fa|ther-Poet laugh'd at him for this, and told him, that the Word of the mo&s;t Holy Lady was a &s;ure Word; that <HI>Born</HI> or <HI>to be Born,</HI> &s;ignified the &s;ame thing on this occa&s;ion; that it was properly a Que&s;tion of the Gen|der, and that we may &s;peak of things that will infallibly happen, as of tho&s;e that are

already in Being. The Fryar had yet ano|ther Objection to make again&s;t <HI>Natum ma|rem,</HI> but he only mutter'd a little, &s;aying, there never was <HI>Natus foemina,</HI> for he was afraid of giving Offence: And thus ended our Conference.</P>
<P>There are a great number of Candle|&s;ticks, with Branches and other Luminaries, all round the Hou&s;e without, that is, round the Walls which enclo&s;e it. But one of the greate&s;t Rarities we ob&s;erv'd, was the Proce&s;&s;ions of tho&s;e who &s;urround this Hou&s;e on their Knees, &s;ome compa&s;s it five times, others &s;even, and &s;ome twelve, according to the My&s;tery they &s;earch for in the number. Repre&s;ent to your &s;elf forty or fifty Per&s;ons, Men, Women, and little Children, all creeping on their Knees, as they turn from one &s;ide, and a like num|ber meeting them, as they go to the other; every one is furni&s;h'd with Beads, and mum|bles <HI>Pater-no&s;ters:</HI> in the mean time they all &s;trive to creep next the Wall, both to &s;hor|ten their way, and to be neare&s;t to the <HI>Holy Place;</HI> which makes them jo&s;tle each other, and cau&s;es no &s;mall confu&s;ion. This is never done, but when there is but a little Company there. The great re&s;ort of Pil|grims is at <HI>Ea&s;ter,</HI> and about the Fe&s;tival of the Virgin's Nativity, which they &s;olem|nize in the Month of <HI>September;</HI> at which times they are obliged to take other Mea|&s;ures. I cannot, without reluctancy, men|tion a thing, which may &s;eem incredible, yet is affirmed by them for a certain Truth;
<PB N="242" REF="149">
which is, That in the Years of the greate&s;t Concour&s;e, they have &s;everal times count|ed two hundred thou&s;and Pilgrims and upwards, during the&s;e two Fea&s;ts.</P>
<P>One can &s;carcely imagine a plea&s;anter &s;ight, than the Caravans of He and She Pilgrims, when the&s;e Caravans come toge|ther, as bodies of Confraternities: Many Societies of <HI>Bologna,</HI> for Example, join to|gether to go on Pilgrimage in Company. Each Society have their<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Saccola.</NOTE> Frocks of ordi|nary Linen-Cloth, with a Cowl of the &s;ame Linen, made like a Strainer for <HI>Hip|pocras,</HI> which quite covers their Heads, and leaves only three Holes for their Eyes and Mouth. There are Fraternities of all Colours: They forget not their Beads, Girdles, Pilgrims Staves, and the Arms of the Society, which are painted, or em|broidered, before and behind, on the Back and Brea&s;t of every Brother. The&s;e Pil|grims thus equipped, ride upon A&s;&s;es, which are reputed to have &s;ome &s;mack of Sanctity, by often going on Pilgrimage. They &s;eldom fall; and if they happen to do &s;o, they &s;ay 'tis without danger to the Pilgrim. So much for the Men. The Womens Habits are as rich as po&s;&s;ibly they can procure: And they fix to the Body of their Gowns, a little Pilgrim's Staff, of the length of a Hand<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">Some are of Gold, Silver, Ebony, Ivory, Artificial Flowers, and many are enriched with Pearls, and Precious Stones, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> A Staff, which gives occa&s;ion for many plea&s;ant Thoughts, and &s;erves for Diver&s;ion to

all the Company on the Way. The&s;e So|cieties of Ladies ride in Cala&s;hes, &s;urroun|ded with whole Squadrons of A&s;s-Troopers. Is it not pretty to &s;ee the&s;e Morrice-Dan|cers thus mounted and dre&s;&s;ed, make an hundred Rounds, and Antick Po&s;tures, accompanied with fooli&s;h Songs to divert the Lady Pilgrims? Let not this Liberty of the Women &s;urprize you. The Pre|tence of Devotion to our mo&s;t holy Lady, is a Rea&s;on &s;ufficient to relea&s;e them from their u&s;ual Pri&s;ons: And be&s;ides, I doubt not but every one hath a Brother, or &s;ome other Spy near her.</P>
<P>I might tell you a great many things of the Church, but I fear you are cloy'd with &s;uch Stories: Only you mu&s;t know, that all that is rich in the Hou&s;e is but of &s;mall value, in compari&s;on of what we &s;aw in the Trea&s;ury-Chamber. This Chamber is a &s;pacious place: Ten great Pre&s;&s;es, with folding-Doors, &s;erve as Wain|&s;cot to the Walls; the vaulted Roof is of a fine &s;ort of Plai&s;ter, with gilded Com|partments, adorn'd with fine Pictures. The Silver-work is not thought worthy of ad|mittance into the Pre&s;&s;es; it was allowed at the fir&s;t, but at pre&s;ent it is confu|&s;edly heaped up in private places, till they have occa&s;ion to u&s;e it.

They have built a Church, and a mo&s;t magnificent Palace. They have &s;ettled Revenues, and purcha&s;ed Lands beyond all view; and it is not to be doubted but they have Che&s;ts full of Money. This is not all; the Boxes furni&s;h them with prodigious Sums, and one of the Secrets they make u&s;e of, to &s;tir up the Devotees to fill them, I think very well de&s;erves a Relation. They di&s;tribute a Printed Paper, by which they endeavour to per&s;wade the People, that the <HI>Holy Hou&s;e</HI> hath no more than twenty &s;even thou&s;and Crowns in Reve|nue;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Crown is worth near Five Shillings Six Pence <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> Money.</NOTE> and by another Computation which they annex to the former, they &s;how, that they are obliged to disbur&s;e thirty eight thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and thirty four Crowns, to pay the Officers Salaries, and other Annual Expences. See then above eleven thou&s;and Crowns, which according to this pretended Account, they fall &s;hort every Year. This is a ready way to take Opportunity to make pathetick Repre&s;en|tations

of their Poverty, and to move the Compa&s;&s;ion of devout Pilgrims, in favour of our good Lady, who, &s;ay they, loves nothing more than the Vertue of Libe|rality.</P>
<P>As we left the Trea&s;ury, they carried us to the Ar&s;enal, which is not con&s;ide|rable: There they &s;hewed us &s;ome Arms taken from the <HI>Turks,</HI> and relate, that the&s;e Barbarians having made a De&s;cent to plunder the Trea&s;ury,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mahomet II.</HI> and after him <HI>Selim</HI> his Ne|phew.</NOTE> about fifty Years ago, our Lady &s;truck them all blind ju&s;t at the very Entrance; at which time they &s;eized on part of their Arms. From the Windows of this Ar&s;enal, you behold the part of the Sea, over which, as they &s;ay, the Hou&s;e was brought: They add, that ever &s;ince, there is a certain White Way on the Water; and our Je&s;uit made u&s;e of the highe&s;t A&s;&s;everations, to prote&s;t to us, that he had often &s;een it.

There mu&s;t be as well Impudence on one &s;ide, on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, as there is a great deal of Prejudice and Stupidity on the other.</P>
<P>After we had &s;een &s;ome Apartments of the Palace, they led us into the Cel|lar, where we found one hundred and

forty great Tuns, full of good Wine. From thence we went to the place where the Drugs were kept; where they &s;hew'd us three hundred and forty five Ve&s;&s;els of Earthen-Ware, which they &s;aid were painted by <HI>Raphael,</HI> and are infinitely e&s;teemed. On five of the large&s;t, are St. <HI>Paul,</HI> and the four Evangeli&s;ts; and on the others, the Hi&s;tory of the Saints, the Metamorpho&s;es of <HI>Ovid,</HI> and Plays of Children.</P>

<P>AS we pa&s;s'd thro' <HI>Recanati,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">RECANATI.</NOTE> which is a little City on the top of a Hill, three Miles from <HI>Loretto,</HI> I alighted for a while to &s;ee the great Church: I di&s;cover|ed nothing there worthy of Ob&s;ervation, but the Tomb of poor <HI>Gregory</HI> XII. Pope of <HI>Rome;</HI> who, as you know, was depo&s;ed from the Pontificate by the Council of <HI>Pi|&s;a;</HI> together with <HI>Peter de Luna,</HI> who a&s;|&s;um'd the Name of <HI>Benedict</HI> XIII. and was Pope of <HI>Avignon.</HI></P>
<P>Ten Miles from thence, in a mo&s;t fruit|ful Country, on the Bank of the <HI>Potenza,</HI> we pa&s;t thro' the Ruines of the City for|merly called <HI>Helvia Ricina,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">HELVIA RICINA.</NOTE> where there are yet to be &s;een great Fragments of an Amphitheatre, which was built of Stone
<PB N="248" REF="152">
and Brick mingled together, like that of <HI>Rimini.</HI> On this &s;ide the River, we were enclo&s;ed among Hills for two Miles, after which we arrived at <HI>Macerata,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">MACERATA</NOTE> where we lay. They told us this City was indiffe|rently large, and very plea&s;ant; but it was late, and be&s;ides foul Weather, &s;o that we walked not abroad. Between <HI>Macerata</HI> and <HI>Tolentino,</HI> there is a fat, and well cultivated Plain, though the Country be &s;lenderly inhabited: They plant great Reeds, to prop up the Vines,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Buffalo's <HI>were brought to</HI> Italy, An. 595. Ciacon.</NOTE> and make u&s;e of <HI>Buf|falo's</HI> to draw their Ploughs: The&s;e Animals are far &s;tronger than Oxen, and eat much le&s;s.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">TOLEN|TINO.</NOTE><HI>Tolentino</HI> is &s;eated on a Ri&s;ing Ground; I could not learn there was any thing re|markable there, but &s;ome Relicks, which are things that we take little notice of. From thence we came to the Town of <HI>Belfort,</HI> which I may tell you, by the bye, is the fir&s;t place built with Stone which we had &s;een in Italy. A good Mile on this &s;ide, we came into the Province of <HI>Umbria,</HI> where we began to enter into the Confines of the <HI>Appennine.</HI></P>
<P>A Gentleman of the Neighbourhood, who was going to <HI>Foligno,</HI> our way, ac|co&s;ted us near to <HI>Macerata.</HI> I was glad of his Company, hoping to get information of &s;everal things relating to the Country; we pre&s;ently di&s;cour&s;ed of our famous La|dy, of whom he related a hundred Sto|ries. The Di&s;cour&s;e being turned to Reli|gion, he told me, among&s;t other things,
<PB N="249" REF="152">
that there was great rejoycing in <HI>Italy,</HI> that our King was become a Chri&s;tian: when I de&s;ired him to explain his mean|ing; I found he had &s;o many &s;trange Notions, as I thought it impo&s;&s;ible for a|ny Per&s;on to conceive. The Extravagan|cies he accu&s;ed us of, were no le&s;s than tho&s;e which the <HI>Pagans</HI> laid to the charge of the <HI>Primitive Chri&s;tians.</HI> He would &s;ometimes look upon me with &s;ome &s;ati&s;|faction, when I &s;aid any thing which plea|&s;ed him: but he &s;till &s;u&s;pected that I di&s;|&s;embled; and all my Rhetorick could not per&s;uade him we were chri&s;tned.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know that this is the gene|ral Opinion of this Country. They know no more of our Religion than they who live among the <HI>Tobinambouz.</HI> But tho&s;e Gentlemen of the Frock, who are be&s;t acquainted with News, think it meritori|ous to &s;candalize us, and render us odi|ous, by the Follies and Impieties they im|pute to us.</P>
<P>Between <HI>Tolentino</HI> and <HI>Foligno,</HI> for near forty Miles, we were almo&s;t always a|mong&s;t the Rocks, which made the ways often difficult. The principal Villages which we &s;aw in our Pa&s;&s;age, are <HI>Valcima|ra, Ponte di trava, Mutia, Dignano, Colfiorito,</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;a Nuova.</HI> At our leaving the Moun|tains, near to a little Village called <HI>Pala,</HI> we di&s;covered from a height, the Plain of <HI>Foligno,</HI> which from thence makes one of the fine&s;t Pro&s;pects in the World.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hic ver A&s;&s;i|duum. Virg.</NOTE> This great Bottom is encompa&s;&s;ed with rich Hillocks, watered
<PB N="250" REF="153">
with many Rivers, &s;trewed with many plea&s;ant Hou&s;es, and extraordinarily im|proved. We had &s;carcely e&s;caped from the Snows, the Rocks, and the cold and piercing Winds, but on a &s;udden we found our &s;elves fanned by the Air of a &s;weet Climate. The Almond-Trees were alrea|dy blo&s;&s;om'd, which in a moment &s;uc|ceeded to the Fro&s;ts of the Mountains: This, added to the Beauty of a fair and calm Day, gave us the delicious Pro&s;pect of a fine Summer. We could not give o|ver contemplating this delicate Garden, who&s;e extraordinary Charms de&s;erved the highe&s;t Prai&s;es.</P>
<P>After we had in&s;en&s;ibly jogged on three or four Miles in a continual de&s;cent, we came into a &s;treight and level Way, on the &s;ide whereof runs a &s;mall River ex|ceedingly clear;<NOTE PLACE="marg">FOLIGNO.</NOTE> and we arrived at <HI>Folig|no,</HI> which is but a Mile farther, at the end of this way. Though this City be &s;eated in a Terre&s;trial Paradi&s;e, it has nothing el&s;e con&s;iderable: Yet they &s;ay, that Trade flows thither more abundantly than to mo&s;t of the other Cities of the Eccle&s;ia|&s;tical State which we have &s;een. Their Trade con&s;i&s;ts in Draperies, Gold and Silver Lace, &s;ome Silks, and Spicery. The <HI>Goths</HI> plunder'd it &s;everal times; and there are no old Monuments remaining.</P>
<P>A little while after we left <HI>Foligno,</HI> we &s;aw on the other &s;ide of the Plain, upon an Eminence, the Town of <HI>Montefalco,</HI> where the miraculous <HI>S. Clara</HI> lies enterred.
<PB N="251" REF="153">
They &s;how there, as they told us, three Stones about the bigne&s;s of &s;mall Nuts, which were found in the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">They &s;how all the In&s;truments of the Pa&s;&s;ion, which are found there with the Stones.</NOTE> Heart of that Saint, and upon which the Hi&s;tory of the Pa&s;&s;ion is engraved. But that which is mo&s;t admirable, is, that all the three Stones together, weigh no more than one of 'em &s;ingly; and con&s;equently one weighs as much as all the three:</P>
<P>Not far from thence is the City of <HI>A&s;|&s;i&s;a,</HI> where they keep the Bones of that Saint, who preached to the Swallows, and made him&s;elf a Wife and whole Family of Snow; and who&s;e Legend is &s;tored with Fables.

It is &s;aid, that a certain Bi|&s;hop of the I&s;le of <HI>Cor&s;ica,</HI> who believed him&s;elf to have a greater Privilege than o|thers, about &s;ixty Years ago, ob&s;tinately re&s;olved to &s;ee them, and that by Divine Permi&s;&s;ion, he was pre&s;ently &s;truck with &s;udden Death. It is true, &s;o much inter|ce&s;&s;ion was made to this Saint, that a lit|tle after the Prelate came to life again.</P>
<P>Near the Village of <HI>Pe&s;ignano,</HI> be|tween <HI>Foligno</HI> and <HI>Spoletto,</HI> and at the Foot of the Hill which &s;urrounds the Plain, a plentiful Spring runs out of four Outlets under a Rock, and in&s;tantly
<PB N="252" REF="154">
makes a little Lake. There the four Ri|vulets being united, make from thence a plea&s;ant River, which afterwards forms an infinity of Meanders; which, without doubt, contribute very much to the fruit|fulne&s;s as well as Ornament of the Coun|try it waters. About two hundred Paces from this Spring, there is on the Way-&s;ide, a very little Temple of <HI>Corinthian</HI> Or|der. One who &s;eem'd to have &s;ome skill in Antiquity, told me at <HI>Spoletto,</HI> that this little River is the <HI>Clitumnus,</HI> &s;poken of by &s;ome ancient Authors, and among o|thers, by <HI>Virgil</HI> in the Second Book of his <HI>Georgicks:</HI> and the Rea&s;ons alledged for this Opinion &s;eem very probable. But that which the vulgar Opinion adds, that the little Temple, con&s;ecrated to <HI>Clitumnus,</HI> was made a Deity, is a Story without any appearance of Truth. For be&s;ides that this Temple is built Cro&s;s-wi&s;e, and <HI>Ea&s;tward,</HI> as the mo&s;t part of the Chri&s;tian Churches are; and that there are Cro&s;&s;es carved in divers places of the Pediments, which agrees not with the fa&s;hi|ons of <HI>Pagani&s;m:</HI> The three following In|&s;criptions are engraved on the Fri&s;es of the Front, and on both &s;ides. (1) &cross; <HI>S C S Deus Profetarum qui fecit Redimptionem.</HI> (2) <HI>Deus Angelorum qui fecit Re&s;urrectionem.</HI> (3) &cross; <HI>S C S Deus Apo&s;to</HI> * * * *, the re&s;t is broken off. The Characters are not in the lea&s;t <HI>Gothick,</HI> nor any other part of the Architecture. Perhaps this Temple was built out of the Ruines of that of <HI>Clitum|nus.</HI>
<PB N="253" REF="154">
It is now call'd <HI>S. Salvatore;</HI> and the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Spoletto</HI> &s;ays Ma&s;s there once a year.</P>
<P>From <HI>Pe&s;ignano</HI> to <HI>Spoletto,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">SPOLETTO.</NOTE> which is but &s;even Miles, you coa&s;t the plain Country at the foot of the Hills; there are in all the&s;e Parts a con&s;iderable number of Vil|lages and Hou&s;es, &s;catter'd here and there. <HI>Spoletto</HI> lies within the Mountain, over the rich Plain which I de&s;crib'd before. It is a poor City, thinly peopled, ill built, and in a very uneven Situation. They carried us to the Cathedral, after they had boa&s;t|ed much of the height of the Body of the Church; but after all, we found nothing extraordinary in its height. The Pave|ment is made of little Pieces of Marble, inlaid, like the Church of St. <HI>Mark</HI> at <HI>Ve|nice;</HI> and all the Pediment of the great Portal, is fine <HI>Mo&s;aick,</HI> on a Golden Ground. From thence we went to the Ca&s;tle, which is in the highe&s;t place of the City. It is only &s;trong by its Situa|tion; but we found nothing in it to re|compen&s;e the trouble we had in going up to it. They &s;hewed us from this height, about five hundred Paces from the City, a Church which had been con&s;ecra|ted to <HI>Concord,</HI> and is now call'd <HI>The Chapel of the Crucifix.</HI> There are at <HI>Spoletto</HI> &s;ome other old Fragments, a Triumphal-Arch half ruined, &s;ome Remainders of an Am|phitheatre, and divers loo&s;e Marble Stones, but without any In&s;criptions, except the Arch, on which we may yet di&s;tingui&s;h &s;ome Characters. The Aqueduct which
<PB N="254" REF="155">
joyns the Mountain of St. <HI>Francis</HI> to that of <HI>Spoletto,</HI> is the more con&s;iderable, in that it is entire, and hath always been in u&s;e &s;ince it was fir&s;t made: But this is a <HI>Gothick</HI> Work; it is three hundred and fifty Paces in length, and two hun|dred and thirty Foot high, mea&s;uring from the top of it to the bottom of the Valley.</P>
<P>Three Miles on this &s;ide <HI>Spoletto,</HI> we pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Somma,</HI> which is the highe&s;t Mountain on this Road. And after we had been for five or &s;ix Miles among&s;t the dry and de&s;art Rocks; tho&s;e Rocks were on a &s;udden changed into Embel|li&s;hments. During the &s;pace of four Miles, we found Nature had employed all its endeavours to cover the&s;e Mountains en|tirely with Laurels, wild Olive-Trees, Ta|marinds, Junipers, Ever-green Oaks, and a wonderful variety of other Trees or Shrubs, which pre&s;erve their Verdure all the Winter. If you pa&s;s that way in <HI>Ja|nuary,</HI> or <HI>July,</HI> you find it &s;till almo&s;t the &s;ame.

At our approach to <HI>Terni,</HI> tho&s;e Mountains which had always confined us in a &s;treight Pa&s;&s;age, on the Brink of the Torrent, which runs at the bottom of the Valley, left us by degrees, and we found our &s;elves in a great Fore&s;t of Olive-Trees. The&s;e Trees were loaden with Fruits, it being the Cu&s;tom to let them ripen till
<PB N="255" REF="155">
they fall off them&s;elves, or with the lea&s;t &s;haking. The green Olives which they pre&s;erve in Pickle, are gathered before they are ripe, and they take away their bitterne&s;s by Art. Tho&s;e which are ripe have no le&s;s bitterne&s;s than the green ones. And it is very &s;trange that the bittere&s;t of Fruits &s;hould produce the &s;weete&s;t Li|quor. As we left this Wood of Olives, we travelled about a Mile in a Plain, who&s;e agreeable Air, and Fruitfulne&s;s, was little inferiour to that of <HI>Foligno;</HI> and then came to <HI>Terni,</HI> which is on the River <HI>Nera,</HI> in the mid&s;t of this excellent Coun|try.</P>

<P>We went- to &s;ee the famous Water-fall of Mount <HI>del Marmore,</HI> which is three Miles from <HI>Terni.</HI> The Way is rough and plea&s;ant both together.

<P>IT is &s;o plea&s;ant to travel in good Com|pany, that for this rea&s;on we readily engaged in a Journey to <HI>Naples,</HI> &s;ome|what &s;ooner than we had de&s;ign'd. There are many &s;urprizing Rarities in this excellent Country, which may be ob&s;erv'd by tho&s;e who have the Patience to wait till the Spring is a little advanc'd. Be&s;ides,
<PB N="261" REF="158">
in this Sea&s;on the Fields begin to put on a more &s;miling Countenance; and all the Journey is extreamly plea&s;ant. 'Tis true, it hath been &s;o hard a Winter, that we could not expect a forward Spring; and we now find, that tho' we had taken their Coun&s;el, who advi&s;ed us to put off our Journey till <HI>April,</HI> we could not have ex|pected any con&s;iderable Advantage by &s;o long a delay, by rea&s;on of the continu|ance of the Cold. And be&s;ides, this would have &s;poiled all our Mea&s;ures at <HI>Rome,</HI> where we intend to remain without in|terruption, &s;ince we de&s;ign not to make a|ny long &s;tay there.</P>
<P>They commonly account it five Days Journey from <HI>Rome</HI> to <HI>Naples:</HI> The Road is bad, and we met with but few things worthy of Ob&s;ervation in it: But we find what may make us amends at <HI>Naples,</HI> at the Mountain of <HI>Ve&s;uvius,</HI> and among&s;t the Rareties of <HI>Bayae, Puzzolo,</HI> and other neighbouring places.</P>
<P>Wherefore after we had rambled about <HI>Rome</HI> for two or three Days, and run o|ver the principal things which our Curio|&s;ity thir&s;ted after, we left it in order to our Journey for <HI>Naples.</HI> Twelve Miles from <HI>Rome,</HI> we came to <HI>Marino,</HI> a great Town belonging to the Prince <HI>Colonna,</HI> former|ly known by the Name of the <HI>Villa Maria|na.</HI> Here we left the level Country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marino, <HI>or</HI> Villa Marii.</NOTE> and de|parting from <HI>Marino,</HI> a&s;cended a &s;tony Moun|tain, where are nothing to be found but Wood and <HI>Buffalo's.</HI> I &s;hall &s;ay nothing

<P>As we de&s;cended the Mountain four or five Miles on this &s;ide the Lake, we di&s;covered the Sea, and &s;aw on a little Hillock on the Right-hand, the City cal|led <HI>Citta de la Vigna,</HI> which is the ancient <HI>Lanuvium;</HI> a Municipal City, and the place where <HI>Antoninus Pius</HI> was born; and not the <HI>Lavinium</HI> of <HI>Aeneas,</HI> as the vulgar Opinion is. <HI>Lavina Litora</HI> are ten or twelve Miles from thence, towards that part where <HI>Prattica</HI> is now &s;eated.</P>

<P>'Tis the general Opinion here, and even the Servants at the Inn inform'd us at our Arrival, that the City of <HI>Velitri</HI> was honoured with the birth of <HI>Augu&s;tus.</HI> Some one of our Company asked who that <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> was, and were an&s;wer'd, that he was the fir&s;t Chri&s;tian Emperour.

<P>In the mid&s;t of the great Place of <HI>Ve|litri,</HI> there is a very fine Statue of Bra&s;s of Pope <HI>Urban</HI> VIII.

They carried us to the Marqui&s;s <HI>Ginetti</HI>'s Hou&s;e; the &s;i|tuation of which is very agreeable, and the Apartments adorn'd with a great num|ber of Antiquities.</P>
<P>Coming down the Hill of <HI>Velitri,</HI> we ob&s;erved a great number of Caves, and Cellars dug, under the Rocks, to pre&s;erve the Wines cool.

'Tis certain, that by Winds, Rains, great Floods,
<PB N="269" REF="162">
Earthquakes, and other Accidents, Plains are rai&s;ed up, and Hills fall down; Val|leys are filled up; the Earth gains upon the Sea, and the Sea on the Earth; the Sea makes the Earth Lakes, and the Earth turns the Sea to I&s;lands; Rivers are dried up, and change their Cour&s;e; Mountains &s;well, and become level; and the Figure of the Globe is in perpetual variation. I could produce Examples of all this. It is true, the&s;e Changes are not univer&s;al. The length of the Pavement, for Example, which continues for two Miles or there|abouts, to <HI>Terracina,</HI> is exactly level with the circumjacent Lands.</P>
<P>Of all the Antique Monuments I have &s;een hitherto, there is nothing in my mind de&s;erves &s;o much to be admir'd, as the&s;e famous Roads. The Buildings which are pre&s;erved, have been expo&s;ed to few Ac|cidents; and all things being well con&s;i|dered, it is rather matter of A&s;toni&s;hment, that Edifices &s;o exceedingly &s;olid, were &s;o &s;oon ruined, than to &s;ee them &s;till remain|ing. But that an innumerable Number of Pa&s;&s;engers, Hor&s;es, and Chariots, &s;hould ince&s;&s;antly tread on a Pavement for &s;o many Ages, and yet &s;o con&s;iderable Frag|ments of it &s;hould &s;till be found entire, is a thing which &s;eems incredible. The<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Procopius</HI> &s;aith they were all Square, but he was mi&s;ta|ken.</NOTE> Stones of this Pavement are of unequal bigne&s;s; their Colour Greyi&s;h and Red|di&s;h, almo&s;t like ru&s;ty Iron, extreamly hard, and ten or twelve Inches thick.

Though the &s;hape of the&s;e Stones be irre|gular, they are all &s;o exactly join'd, and clo&s;ely united, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to thru&s;t a Sword's Point between them, in tho&s;e places which have &s;till kept their old &s;i|tuation. I have mea&s;ured the breadth of the&s;e two Ways, <HI>Via Appia,</HI> and <HI>Via Fla|minia,</HI> and I found them throughout twen|ty <HI>Roman</HI> Palms broad, with very little dif|ference; which makes fourteen Foot, le&s;s by four Inches, <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mea&s;ure: This is not too much for the meeting of two Chariots. The&s;e Ways which they call <HI>Viae Con&s;ulares,</HI> had on each &s;ide Borders of the &s;ame Stone with the Pavement; and the&s;e Borders &s;tood up two Foot, or there|abouts: I have &s;een them in &s;ome places very well pre&s;erved.

The Chari|ot Wheels have in &s;ome places made deep Ruts, at the mo&s;t three or four Inches; and the manner after which the Canal of this Rut is followed from one Pavement to another, is one of the Proofs of its ancient &s;ituation. The re&s;t of the Pave|ment is even and whole, without any ap|pearance that the Hor&s;e-&s;hooes have worn it in the lea&s;t. They told me, that there is another very thick Lay of Stone, placed on a Bed of Sand, which &s;erves for

After all if on the one &s;ide the&s;e Ways were beautiful and advantageous; on the other &s;o hard and &s;lippery a Pavement, was not with|out its inconveniencies: and we took care to avoid it, at the &s;ame time we admired it.</P>

Others believe that every Di&s;tance is the Work of ten Days; and that the inequa|lity of the di&s;tances was cau&s;ed by the more or le&s;s ea&s;e the Workmen found in cutting the Rock. And that which gave occa&s;ion for this Thought is, that the di|&s;tances above are greater than tho&s;e below, the Rock &s;till growing narrower towards the top. But I find one main Objection again&s;t this Sentiment; for probably they began to work at the top of the Rock; &s;o that the fir&s;t Tenth &s;hould have been marked above, and the Number CXX. found below; all this &s;eems to me not ea&s;ie to be under&s;tood.</P>

<P><HI>Fondi</HI> is all paved with Stones of the <HI>Via Appia,</HI> but we do not find that they are joined &s;o well as heretofore.

<PB N="274" REF="165">
1273, or according to the old Legend, 1274; by which you may judge of the Age of this Tree. There is a Story of a certain Tree of <HI>Cochin-China,</HI> which lived two thou&s;and Years; and we have a Re|lation of <HI>China,</HI> which tells us of a Tree &s;o old and &s;o big, that twenty Men could &s;carcely embrace it: But Orange-Trees are not of &s;o long continuance. It is an incredible thing, for every body a&s;|&s;ures me here, that never any of the&s;e Trees attained to the Age of four hun|dred Years. It was nece&s;&s;ary the <HI>Domi|nicans</HI> &s;hould have &s;ome miraculous me|morial of the Angelical St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> as well as of their great Patriarch St. <HI>Dominick,</HI> of whom they have another Orange-Tree, at St. <HI>Sabina,</HI> on Mount <HI>Aventin:</HI> But what may not a Man believe on this Sub|ject, after what <HI>Surius</HI> relates of the old Olive-Trees of <HI>Nazareth,</HI> and of the ac|cur&s;ed Fig-Tree, which was to be &s;een within the&s;e two and thirty Years? That this Trunk hath la&s;ted &s;o long, after the Cur&s;e it received, is a thing not ea&s;ie to be under&s;tood, without taking notice of the nature of the Tree, which allows it not &s;o long a Life.</P>
<P>They would per&s;uade us at <HI>Terracina,</HI> that we &s;hould find the Leaves of the O|range-Tree of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> of another &s;hape than tho&s;e of other Orange-Trees; as they talk of the Almond-Tree of St. <HI>Francis,</HI> which is yet to be &s;een on Mount <HI>Luco,</HI> and of which the Leaves grow, as they

&s;ay, with Cro&s;&s;es well &s;haped. But we could not perceive this pretended difference; nor could we find that the Winter had been more favourable to the Oranges of this venerable Tree; for they were all frozen, as well as tho&s;e of the Garden of <HI>Cicero,</HI> who, I may tell you by the bye, pa&s;&s;es at <HI>Fondi</HI> for a kind of Saint, as well as <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> at <HI>Velitri:</HI> When this Tree &s;hall die, if at lea&s;t it ever mu&s;t, they propo&s;e to them|&s;elves to make a Shrine of it, to contain &s;ome Relicks of the Saint who planted it. This is no ill Thought.

It is paved through|out with great &s;quare Stones, cut to a Pattern. The Streets are &s;trait, and mo&s;t of them broad. The Hou&s;es are high, with flat Roofs, and uniform Building. <HI>London, Paris, Rome, Venice,</HI> and a great number of other Cities, have, in truth, fine No|blemens Hou&s;es; but the&s;e Hou&s;es are mixed with great a number of ordinary ones, whereas <HI>Naples</HI> is generally all very fair.

with three Orders of Architecture.

There are many Fountains, which contribute as well to the great Conveniency, as Embelli&s;h|ment of the City: And three of the&s;e Fountains are of an incomparable gran|deur and beauty. But that which &s;eem|ed to us mo&s;t extraordinary at <HI>Naples</HI> was the Number and Magnificence of the Churches. It may be ju&s;tly &s;aid, that in this re&s;pect it &s;urpa&s;&s;es Imagination. If one would take a view of the fine Pie|ces of Architecture, the Churches mu&s;t be vi&s;ited, you mu&s;t behold the Fronti&s;piece, the Portals, the Chapels, the Altars, and the Tombs. If you would look upon rare Pictures, Sculptures, and the rarety of Ve&s;&s;els of Gold and Silver, you need but go to the Churches; the Arches, the Wain&s;cots, the Walls are all covered with pieces of precious Marble, mo&s;t artificially laid together, or with Compartiments of <HI>Ba&s;&s;o Relievo,</HI> or of Joyners-work gilded, and enriched with the Works of the mo&s;t famous Painters. There is nothing to be &s;een but <HI>Ja&s;per, Porphyrie, Mo&s;aick</HI> of all fa&s;hions, and the Quinte&s;cence of Art.
<PB N="287" REF="171">
I vi&s;ited five and twenty, or thirty of the&s;e &s;tately Edifices, where one &s;till finds him &s;elf &s;urprized afre&s;h. If it were po&s;&s;ible to unite eight or ten together, and make a regular Compo&s;ition out of 'em all, I believe it would be the mo&s;t magnificent Structure in the World.</P>
<P>I dare not venture on an exact De&s;cri|ption of &s;o many Particulars, yet cannot forbear to mention at lea&s;t &s;ome of the&s;e Churches, which we found mo&s;t remark|able, &s;ince perhaps it may be of u&s;e to you hereafter. The Church of the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> is an admirable Piece: The <HI>Dome</HI> was paint|ed by the Chevalier <HI>Lanfranc;</HI> and which way &s;oever you turn in this &s;tately Tem|ple, all parts are enriched with mo&s;t co&s;t|ly Ornaments, from the Pavement to the Roof.

Burnet.</HI></NOTE> There you may &s;ee al&s;o that famous Ho&s;pital, who&s;e Revenue amounts to above two hundred thou&s;and Ducats of Gold. All is very rich and &s;ur|prizing; St. <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Neri, Santa Maria la Nuovo,</HI> St. <HI>Severin</HI>'s, St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s, St. <HI>Domi|nick</HI>'s, the Church and Mona&s;tery of <HI>Mount Olivet;</HI> at the Church of the <HI>Holy Apo&s;tles,</HI> St. <HI>John Carbonare,</HI> the Cathedral, the lit|tle Ho&s;pital, and St. <HI>Mary's of Health.</HI> I omit above three hundred others to a|void a tedious prolixity: Nor will I take notice of their Trea&s;ures and Ve&s;tries, which are repleni&s;hed with prodigious Ri|ches. Two of the <HI>Theatines</HI> having led

us into their Church of the <HI>Holy Apo&s;tles,</HI> tho&s;e good Fathers declared to us by the manner of their Di&s;cour&s;e, the poor condition of their Order, who have, &s;ay they, more rea&s;on than any others to complain: For if the <HI>Mendicants,</HI> for Exam|ple, have no proper Goods, yet, at lea&s;t, they have liberty to beg: Whereas, the poor and unhappy <HI>Theatines</HI> live only on God's Providence, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing nothing, and not da|ring to ask any thing. Arguing after this manner, after they had made us ob&s;erve the various Magnificencies of their Church, they brought us into the Ve&s;try; where we found fourteen great Cupboards, with double Doors, all filled with Ve&s;&s;els of Gold and Silver, and other precious Or|naments: A Trea&s;ure of poor People, &s;ufficient to &s;atisfie the mo&s;t inordinate Ambition.</P>
<P>The great Convent of the <HI>Chartreux</HI> at St. <HI>Martin's,</HI> is extraordinary full of rare and magnificent things: The Monks who conducted us thither, affirmed to us, that under one Priorate, there were laid out among&s;t them five hundred thou&s;and Du|cats in Silver Plate, Pictures, and Scul|ptures only. Their Church is none of the greate&s;t; but every part of it de&s;erves Admiration: Nothing can be added either to the value of the Matter, or excellence of the Workman&s;hip; all is compleat, and exqui&s;itely beautiful. The Nativity of Chri&s;t, by <HI>Guido,</HI> is an excellent Piece: The four Pictures of the la&s;t Supper,

which are to be &s;een in the &s;ame place, were done by <HI>E&s;pagnolet, Ann.

There are a great many other Pieces highly valued, too many to be here re|cited.</P>
<P>The Cloy&s;ter is one hundred Paces &s;quare: All the Pavement is of Marble, inlaid, repre&s;enting Boughs, and other Or|naments of the like nature; and the four Galleries are &s;upported by &s;ixty Pillars each, of one entire piece, of fine White Marble of <HI>Carrara.</HI> The Monks are plea&s;antly lodged; every one hath his Chamber, his Clo&s;et, his Library, and his little Garden. The Prior's Apartment might well befit a Prince: There, among&s;t other things, you may &s;ee the famous Crucifix of <HI>Michael Ange|lo,</HI> drawn, as is &s;aid, from Nature to the Life, by a certain Pea&s;ant, whom that Painter crucified for that purpo&s;e: This &s;mells like a Fable; but here it goes current for a great Truth. This Picture is of Wood, and is not above half a Foot high. I ob&s;erved that the Crucifix holds his Head exactly &s;treight, which agrees not very well with the Po&s;ture of a Man expiring on a Cro&s;s. They have al&s;o a Saint <HI>Laurence</HI> by <HI>Titian,</HI> and &s;ome De&s;igns of <HI>Ruben's</HI> and <HI>Albert Durer,</HI> which they prize very highly.</P>

<P>They reckon it eight Miles from <HI>Naples</HI> to the top of <HI>Ve&s;uvius.</HI> During the fir&s;t four Miles, we pa&s;t through many good Villages, following the Sea-Coa&s;t: The&s;e places are well till'd, and &s;eem to have re|ceived no damages from the Eruptions of the Mountain, notwith&s;tanding they have happen'd &s;o frequently. There are only from place to place great Stones, which have been rolled thither.</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="183">Going out of this la&s;t Village, called <HI>Re|&s;ina,</HI> we turn'd to the Left, and began to a&s;cend; and you may &s;till travel on Hor&s;e-back two large Miles, or two Miles and an half further, among&s;t loo&s;e Stones, and heaps of baked Earth, which the Vomitings of the Mountain have &s;pread all about. The more you advance, the more you find the Soil cracked, dry, burned, and covered with &s;everal &s;orts of calcined Stones, which are &s;o many Monuments of tho&s;e furious Eruptions. You may al&s;o ob&s;erve in &s;eve|ral places, the Chanels of the Torrents of Sulphur and Bitumen, which have run down from the Mountain. In fine, the A&s;cent be|comes &s;o rough and difficult, that you mu&s;t be forced to go on Foot; you may believe there are neither Taverns, nor other Hou&s;es, nor Boys to hold the Hor&s;es.</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ure you there is a great deal of Pains and Trouble, which mu&s;t be endured be|fore you can mount to this prodigious Fur|nace. You are for the mo&s;t part plunged among&s;t the A&s;hes, if one may properly give that the name of A&s;hes, which rather re&s;embles Brick-du&s;t. Sometimes you fall back in&s;tead of advancing, becau&s;e the A&s;hes give way under your Feet; and at la&s;t, after divers little re&s;tings, you come to the brim of the ancient Gulf; I &s;ay the ancient Gulf, becau&s;e you will per|ceive by and by that things have &s;ome time &s;ince &s;uffered great Alterations.</P>
<P>This fir&s;t height on which we now are, makes a Circle round the Gulf: The top
<PB N="311" REF="183">
of the Mountain having been worn, you may ea&s;ily conceive what kind of Horns and rugged Elevations have been made in the circuit of its height. As near as we could gue&s;s, this va&s;t melting Pot hath near a Mile Diameter; you may go down into it &s;everal ways, about an hundred Paces be|low the &s;teep Circle of the brim of the Mountain, which is all the depth of this old Mouth.</P>
<P>By an extraordinary Eruption, this va&s;t Aby&s;s was almo&s;t quite fill'd, in one of its la&s;t breakings out, with a mixture of Sulphur, of Bitumen, of Minerals, of Al|lom, of Nitre, of Salt-petre, and of Earth melted, or vitrified; all the&s;e matters gi|ving over boiling, have form'd a kind of thick Cru&s;t, or harden'd Scum, which made a level in the Gulf, an Hundred Paces be|low its Brims. A furious &s;haking of the Mountain did afterward break this Cru&s;t, or thickne&s;s of harden'd Matter, and tum|bled the pieces one upon another, as when after you have broken the Ice of a Pond, a &s;udden Fro&s;t pre&s;ently cements all the pieces together. This rugged Superficies is every where equally uneven; and there are here and there burning Funnels; from whence the Fumes continually exhale: In &s;ome places you feel the Heat through your Shooes, only walking over it.</P>
<P>This is not all: Ju&s;t in the middle of this Extent of the Mountain, which, you mu&s;t know, is almo&s;t round; a furious E|ruption hath forced its Pa&s;&s;age, and form'd
<PB N="112" REF="184">
a new Mountain. This Mountain is al&s;o round, and is about a quarter of a Mile in height. I could not count the Paces, be|cau&s;e it was impo&s;&s;ible to make them e|qual, by rea&s;on the A&s;hes hinder it; which, as I have already told you, make one &s;ometimes &s;lide back.</P>
<P>After we had traver&s;ed that rough &s;pace, which is like a low Trench, about Three hundred Paces broad between the Bounds of the greater and le&s;&s;er Mountains, as I have already de&s;cribed them. You mount the la&s;t with as much pains as you did the fir&s;t. It is all full of &s;moaking Chinks. In many places you &s;ee Sulphur almo&s;t pure, with a kind of <HI>Sal Armoniack,</HI> which is almo&s;t of a Citron Colour. In others, there is a reddi&s;h and porous Matter, like the Scum of Iron, which comes from Smiths Forges: There are pieces of all Colours, Fa&s;hions, and Weights: All this having been baked and re-baked by &s;o vehement a Fire, and this Compo&s;ition of &s;o many different Matters, having been melted and incorporated together, you may ea&s;ily i|magine what it is.</P>
<P>The top of the little Mountain hath its opening as well as the great one, which at pre&s;ent is the Throat of this va&s;t Aby&s;s; we gue&s;&s;ed it to be about an hundred Pa|ces in breadth. There i&s;&s;ues out a flood of Smoak, which almo&s;t fills its Capacity; but there come &s;ometimes Gu&s;ts of Wind from above, which drive away this Smoak, &s;ometimes one way, and &s;ometimes another,
<PB N="313" REF="184">
which permitted us to view clearly the height of the Mouth, though at &s;everal times.</P>
<P>The Brink is perpendicular within, ex|cept in one place, where it is &s;loping enough to de&s;cend into it. Our Guide going fir&s;t down, three or four&s;core Paces before, we follow'd him; which (I mu&s;t tell you by the bye) was unnece&s;&s;arily done, and which I would not advi&s;e any body to do. We were then on the Brink of this dreadful Precipice, and we rolled down many Stones, or hard Ma&s;&s;es, which we loo&s;ened about us: Sometimes they &s;topped at the fir&s;t or &s;econd falling; at other times they made a long continuation of boundings with a great noi&s;e. It had been to no purpo&s;e to have computed the time the&s;e Stones took up in their leaps or de&s;cents, becau&s;e there is no bottom can be gue&s;&s;ed at where they mu&s;t &s;top at la&s;t; the noi&s;e cea&s;ing &s;ome|times, only in re&s;pect of tho&s;e who heard it, the di&s;tance alone rendring it in&s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P>We could not perceive that what we tumbled into this Gulf did any way en|crea&s;e its Smoak. It is true, greater Ma&s;|&s;es were nece&s;&s;ary for &s;uch an Experiment; and yet it would have been very uncertain whether they would have produc'd any ef|fect; there being nothing to oblige us to be|lieve that there is a Lake of of boiling mat|ters, which perpendicularly an&s;wers to the Mouth of the Mountain.</P>
<P>Some bring with them Gunpowder, and make Mines, to have the plea&s;ure to blow

up great Rocks: But to &s;peak freely, I think it a great folly to carry their Curio&s;ity &s;o far, in &s;o dangerous a place; and I think it wi&s;ely done not to &s;tay there too long. The &s;udden di&s;gorging of the Flames, is not what is to be mo&s;t feared: But the quaking of the Mountain always pre|cedes the great Claps, and always comes very &s;uddenly.

<P>It is daily found, that Travellers are obliged to march up more difficult A|&s;cents than this; which naturally was on|ly an ea&s;ie &s;loping A&s;cent, and might have been made almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible, by fil|ling up the Ways with Earth, &s;upported by Walls: But out of an extravagant Humour, they pierced the Mountain, and through this Hole, made indeed a &s;horter Way, and of a more extraordinary Stru|cture, but an hundred times more trouble|&s;ome than the A&s;cent of the Hill: This Cave is commonly called,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Grotta <HI>of</HI> Puzzoli, <HI>or</HI> Pau&s;ilypus.</NOTE> <HI>The Grotta of Puzzoli:</HI> It is cut in &s;ome places through the Rock, and in other places through the Sand.

<P>In the Night, between the 19th and 20th of <HI>September,</HI> in the Year 1538. the Earth was brought to Bed of a Mountain, which hath ever &s;ince been called the <HI>New Moun|tain:</HI> Tho&s;e who have mea&s;ured it affirm,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monte Nuo|vo, <HI>or</HI> di Cencre.</NOTE> That it is Four hundred Toi&s;es high per|pendicularly, and three Miles and &s;ome|thing more in Circuit.

<P>The difference between what we now &s;ee of this place, and the De&s;cription which the Ancients make of it to us, cau&s;es &s;ome to tax them commonly for Cheats, with|out any deliberation; particularly <HI>Pliny,</HI> who&s;e Credit being crack'd on a great many other occa&s;ions, is on this, looked upon as a great Lyar. Without undertaking here to make an ab&s;olute Apology for him, I mu&s;t defend him in this particular, and boldly affirm, That he is no Lyar in what he &s;aith of the Lake of <HI>Averno.</HI> He quotes <HI>Varro,</HI> as relating a thing which for|merly was, but &s;aith of him&s;elf nothing po|&s;itively.
<PB N="331" REF="193">
<HI>Pliny,</HI> a mo&s;t curious Man, with|out doubt had many times vi&s;ited this place. I think he was at <HI>Cumae,</HI> not far from thence, when <HI>Ve&s;uvius</HI> burnt &s;o terribly under the Empire of <HI>Titus;</HI> and that going towards that raging Mountain, he was &s;o unfortunate as to lo&s;e his Life. It is then probable enough that <HI>Pliny</HI> would have &s;poken po&s;itively, and as an Eye-wit|ne&s;s of the Birds of <HI>Averno,</HI> if in his time the Air of the Lake had been &s;o fatal to them: But he &s;aith nothing like it. In his Di&s;cour&s;es of the Lakes which have extra|ordinary Qualities, he cites <HI>Cle&s;ias</HI> the <HI>Greek</HI> Hi&s;torian, who &s;peaks of a Lake of the <HI>In|dies,</HI> on which nothing &s;wims; and after|wards produces the Te&s;tiomony of <HI>Varro</HI> touching the <HI>Averno. Strabo</HI> relates, that the Stench of this Lake was partly cau&s;ed by the Trees that hung over its Sides, which covered and compa&s;&s;ed it round a|bout; and he adds, that the&s;e Woods being cut down by <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI>'s Order, the Air be|came pure, and left off producing its u&s;ual effects.</P>
<P>If this matter be true, as it cannot ju&s;t|ly be doubted, &s;ince this Author was Con|temporary to <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> and &s;poke without que&s;tion, as a knowing Witne&s;s, we are not to admire at the po&s;itive te&s;timony of <HI>Varro,</HI> or the Quotation of him by <HI>Pli|ny,</HI> &s;ince the one lived both before, and in the &s;ame time with <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> and others came not till &s;ome time afterwards. With|out being too ready to believe the&s;e Writers,
<PB N="332" REF="194">
we may ea&s;ily conceive, that things may have received Alterations &s;ince their times. <HI>Boccace,</HI> who lived three hundred years &s;ince, relates in his Treati&s;e of Lakes, That &s;ome &s;ubterraneous &s;tream of Sulphur, mixing with the <HI>Averno,</HI> the Waters of that Lake became &s;tinking, and killed a great many of the Fi&s;h; which, he &s;aith, he &s;aw with his own Eyes. This makes it plainly appear, that this Lake hath not been always in the the &s;ame Condition: And the thing may be ea&s;ily explain'd, if we will but a little reflect on the bituminous and &s;ulphureous Matters, of which the adjacent Country is full. Some Earthquake may have ob&s;tructed the Canals of Communication, by which they &s;pread them&s;elves into the Lake <HI>A|verno,</HI> which formerly poi&s;on'd its Waters, and cau&s;ed it to exhale a &s;ubtil Matter, and the more dangerous becau&s;e the Source was &s;hut up under the &s;helter of tho&s;e great Trees which inviron'd it. To imagine that the Birds which fly in the middle Region of the Air over the Lake, &s;hould be of|fended with its Exhalations, would be to frame a Chimera to ones &s;elf, and make the Hi&s;torians &s;ay what they never intended. There is a great deal of Appearance, or ra|ther 'tis plain and certain, that if the Grotto of the <HI>Dog</HI> were but four or five times bigger than it is, a Swallow which &s;hould fly there, &s;weeping the Earth, could never ri&s;e again: And why mu&s;t it be reckoned impo&s;&s;ible, that &s;ome &s;uch thing might for|merly happen on the Lake of <HI>Averno?</HI> One
<PB N="333" REF="194">
of tho&s;e places is greater than the other; but that alters not the Matter of Fact. If you would have another &s;omewhat like this, and not &s;o ea&s;ie to be believed, I will quote your <HI>Natural Hi&s;tory of England,</HI> where it is related, that the Wild Gee&s;e fall dead, when they fly directly over a certain place of the Plain of <HI>Withay</HI> in <HI>York&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>Furthermore, I will here repeat what I have often &s;aid, that let things appear to be never &s;o improbable, provided they im|ply no Contradiction, they ought not ha|&s;tily to be condemned for fal&s;e, without due examination. It mu&s;t be acknowledged, that the Ignorance of Men conceals more things than their Knowledge could ever di&s;cover. We may plea&s;e our &s;elves with acting the Philo&s;ophers, and laugh at occult Qualities, but the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of Nature, to &s;peak &s;incerely, are almo&s;t all incomprehen&s;ible. We pretend to under|&s;tand, and to be able to explain the Ab|&s;tru&s;e&s;t Appearances that happen before our own Eyes, and would be a&s;hamed to own our Ignorance: But if we are told of a|ny thing which &s;urpa&s;&s;es our Under|&s;tanding, or we have not before heard of, we immediately conclude it to be either a Miracle or a Lye.</P>
<P>Though the Word <HI>Avernus</HI> comes from <GAP DESC="foreign">, as <HI>Virgil</HI> &s;aid; there are &s;o many Lakes which bear this Name, that we may look upon it as a general Appella|tion for tho&s;e Sulphurous Gulphs, which

the Ancients call the Gates or Throats of Hell; <HI>O&s;tia Ditis; Orci Janua; Inferni Ja|nua Regis,</HI> as <HI>Virgil</HI> calls them. I fan&s;ie one might &s;ay the &s;ame thing of another Lake not far from this, which is one of the <HI>Acherons.</HI> And it is apparent that this made <HI>Lucretius</HI> call the&s;e kinds of Pools <HI>Averna Loca. Silius</HI> confounds our <HI>Averno</HI> with <HI>Styx</HI> and <HI>Cocytus,</HI> and the other Ri|vers of Hell; which may contribute to our believing, that the&s;e Names became common to many Lakes or Rivers of the like Nature.</P>
<P>The Ruines which appear in many pla|ces on the &s;ide of the Hills about the <HI>A|verno,</HI> &s;hew that this place was extremely well cultivated, after they had cut down the Wood of tall Trees which &s;urround|ed it.</P>
<P>It is uncertain whether the Ruines which are next to the Lake, are of a Temple of <HI>Mercury,</HI> or of <HI>Neptune;</HI> but Antiqua|ries agree, that it was not of a Tem|ple of <HI>Apollo,</HI> as the Vulgar &s;uppo&s;e.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not forget to tell you, that when one comes near the <HI>Averno,</HI> he is &s;ud|denly a&s;&s;aulted by a noi&s;ome Smell; but am not &s;ure that it proceeds from the Lake; for its Waters are fre&s;h, and clear enough, though they encline &s;omething to a dark Blue.

<P>I remember that after I had read the learned Treati&s;e of Mr. <HI>Blondel,</HI> concerning the pretended <HI>Sibyls,</HI> and their &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>Si|bylline</HI> Writings, I ea&s;ily freed my &s;elf from the power of vulgar Prejudices, and was fully per&s;uaded that all was chimerical and &s;uppo&s;ititious: What&s;oever a con&s;iderable number of learned Men had formerly &s;aid, or &s;ome of tho&s;e hone&s;t Doctors of Antiqui|ty, whom we u&s;ually call <HI>Fathers.</HI> I was afterwards confirmed in this Opinion, by &s;tudying this Matter with a competent de|gree
<PB N="336" REF="196">
of Application; and therefore you may ea&s;ily think,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some pretend that the Cave of the <HI>Sibyl</HI> was at <HI>Cumae,</HI> and they cite the de|&s;cription <HI>Ju&s;tin Martyr</HI> makes of it. What he &s;aid has &s;ome relation to what <HI>Virgil</HI> &s;peaks. But at the bot|tom, the opinion of <HI>Ju&s;tin Mar|tyr</HI> is no proof; he tells you what he heard &s;aid, which &s;ig|nifies nothing.</NOTE> that I give little credit to what they talk here of this <HI>Sibyl</HI>'s Grotto. Many ancient Authors have &s;poken of a <HI>Sibylla Cumaea,</HI> and of a Den to which &s;he retired; and People have imagin'd that this may agree with it, and have con&s;ecrated it to her without any other rea&s;on than bare imagination, and without alledging any tolerable Arguments. The Pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Vir|gil, Exci&s;um Euboicae,</HI> &amp;c. &s;ignifies nothing at all: For be&s;ides, that in <HI>Virgil</HI>'s time, the Fable of the <HI>Sibyl</HI> was accounted an old Er|rour; of which that Author &s;poke only by Tradition: I cannot &s;ee that what he &s;aid hath any relation to this Cavern.</P>
<Q><L>Quo lati ducunt aditus centum, o&s;tia centum,</L>
<L>Unde ruunt totidem voces, &amp;c.</L></Q>
<P>There is no appearance that this Cave ever had <HI>centum aditus,</HI> or <HI>centum o&s;tia;</HI> but why, I pray, mu&s;t there be a Cave above a League in length, for the lodging a <HI>Sibyl?</HI> And what Workmen had &s;he to employ in &s;o prodigious a Task? It is al&s;o ridiculous to think that &s;he had her Chamber wain|&s;cotted with Mo&s;aick; a deep and dark Den, hanged with Bats and Cobwebs, is what more properly belonged to this pre|tended mad Woman, than Chambers a|dorned with Painting and Mo&s;aick,</P>
<P>If you will know what is my Opinion of this Den, I mu&s;t an&s;wer you, That per|haps it was a Pa&s;&s;age like the Grotto of <HI>Pau&s;i|lypus,</HI>
<PB N="337" REF="196">
and perhaps al&s;o the Painted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">One may al&s;o &s;uppo&s;e that there were Baths there for &s;ome great Lord.</NOTE> Cham|ber was for &s;ome Deity, as the Chapel of the &s;ame Grotto of <HI>Pau&s;ilypus</HI> is for a cer|tain Image of <HI>our Lady. Strabo</HI> relates upon the Te&s;timony of <HI>Ephorus,</HI> an ancient Hi&s;to|rian and Geographer of <HI>Cumae,</HI> That the <HI>Cimmerians</HI> of <HI>Italy</HI> (I call them &s;o, that I may not confound them with tho&s;e of the <HI>Bo&s;phorus</HI>) did inhabit between <HI>Bayae</HI> and the Lake of <HI>Averno;</HI> that they had no other Dwellings than &s;ubterraneous Dens, where they hid them&s;elves all Day, and at Night i&s;&s;ued out to perpetrate their Robberies and Murders. We will, if you plea&s;e, attri|bute the digging of this Cave to them; on|ly the Mo&s;aick agrees little better with them than with the <HI>Sibyl.</HI> To conclude, though I &s;hould tell you, that I neither know the u&s;e of this Grotto, nor when it was made, nor who were the Workmen, it would by no means follow that it was the <HI>Sibyl</HI>'s Grotto. Without going further than<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">near to <HI>Mire|mont</HI> in <HI>Peri|gort,</HI> there is a great and fa|mous Cave, called the <HI>Clou&s;eau;</HI> of which the Country People tell divers Stories: They &s;ay, that there are great Halls, Pictures, and Altars, and are per|&s;uaded, that the Pagans there &s;acrificed to <HI>Venus,</HI> and the infernal Gods. <HI>Moreri.</HI></NOTE> <HI>France</HI> or <HI>England,</HI> I might name you a great many &s;uch like Caverns, where a <HI>Sibyl</HI> never was.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIII.</HEAD>
<P>I Cannot expre&s;s the Plea&s;ure with which I read your long Letter, that part of it e&s;pecially which a&s;&s;ures me that my Letters have given you &s;ome Satis|faction.</P>
<P>I do not intend to trouble you with Reflexi|ons on the pre&s;ent Occurrences in your Coun|try, of which you have given me an Account: For be&s;ides, that &s;uch a De&s;ign would engage me into long and u&s;ele&s;s Digre&s;&s;ions, I am per|&s;waded, that an An&s;wer to tho&s;e new Que&s;tions
<PB N="2" REF="218">
which you propo&s;e concerning <HI>Venice,</HI> will be more acceptable to you. I will endeavour then to an&s;wer them &s;uccinctly, and in the &s;ame or|der in which you have rank'd them; and after|wards proceed to entertain you with my Ob&s;er|vations concerning <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. Your <HI>Venetian Gentleman</HI> may affirm as po&s;itively as he plea&s;es, That <HI>Venice</HI> contains <HI>Two hundred and fifty thou&s;and</HI> Souls; but you mu&s;t not imagine, that becau&s;e he is a Citizen of <HI>Venice,</HI> he mu&s;t be a competent Judge of the number of its Inhabitants; that is a thing which neither his Eyes nor mine can ever be able to determine, nor can it be known without a very diligent and nice Enquiry: And therefore I am &s;till of the opinion, that this Controver&s;ie ought to be decided by the Authority of tho&s;e who have grounded their Calculations on a careful and particular Examination. I told you, that the Computation which I follow, comprehends the Inhabitants of <HI>la Giudeca,</HI> for I look upon that I&s;land as a part of the City of <HI>Venice;</HI> but I do not include the I&s;le of <HI>Murana.</HI> In the mean time you mu&s;t give me leave to tell you, that you carry the point too far, when you pretend, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to make a judgment of the number of the Inhabitants of a great City; for, if you con&s;ider what has been done by Sir <HI>William Petty,</HI> you will be convinc'd, that there are rational methods to make &s;uch a computation, without any con&s;ide|rable Error.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="3" REF="218">II. The two great Columns of <HI>Granite,</HI> which are near the Sea, at the end of the place call'd the <HI>Broglio,</HI> were brought from<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><P>They might have been brought from <HI>Egypt</HI> to <HI>Con|&s;tantinople,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Venice.</HI></P>
<P>It was one <HI>Nic. Baratier</HI> who undertook to fix them in the place where they &s;till remain. He ask'd no other Recompence, but that he might have leave to &s;et up a Priviledg'd Gaming-hou&s;e between the two Columns; which was granted him.</P></NOTE> <HI>Egypt,</HI> or, as &s;ome &s;ay, from <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> The Lyon of St. <HI>Mark</HI> holding an open Book, with the In&s;cri+ption of <HI>Pax tibi, Marce,</HI> &amp;c. is upon one of the&s;e Columns; and tho&s;e are the Arms of <HI>Ve|nice.</HI> The Statue of S. <HI>Theodore</HI> is on the other Pillar. I think I told you, that 'tis the Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Signiory</HI> to erect &s;uch Columns in all the Cities under its Dominion.</P>
<P>Your Friend has mi&s;inform'd you, who told you, that the three great Banners, which on Fe&s;ti|val days are &s;et up on the Brazen Pede&s;tals over again&s;t S. <HI>Mark</HI>'s Church, repre&s;ent the State of <HI>Venice</HI> and the two Kingdoms of <HI>Cyprus</HI> and <HI>Candia.</HI> This, I confe&s;s, is the generally-receiv'd Opinion, but 'tis as fal&s;e as common; for the Republic's Arms are to be &s;een, without the lea&s;t difference, on all the three Banners; nor is there any De&s;ign to repre&s;ent either <HI>Cyprus</HI> or <HI>Candia,</HI> which are not &s;o much as nam'd. I cannot comprehend the meaning of tho&s;e who have a&s;&s;ur'd you, that the Republick has no Coat of Arms, and that the above-mention'd Lyon is too highly re&s;pected at <HI>Venice</HI> to be put in a Scutcheon. That &s;ame Lyon is to be &s;een in all tho&s;e places where the Arms of the State ought to be: And it is no le&s;s ridiculous to &s;ay, that it &s;erves in&s;tead of Arms, but really is no &s;uch thing, than it would be to pretend that the <HI>Venetians</HI> wear no Shirts, but that they make
<PB N="4" REF="219">
u&s;e of certain pieces of Linnen, that are cut and &s;ew'd exactly like our Shirts, which only &s;erve them in&s;tead of Shirts. It cannot be rea&s;onably &s;uppos'd, that the Re&s;pect they have for their Lyon &s;hould hinder them from u&s;ing it for their Arms, &s;ince we commonly &s;ee <HI>Saints</HI> and <HI>Cruci|fixes</HI> apply'd to the &s;ame u&s;e. And you know the &s;tory of a <HI>Venetian</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, who told an Emperor that ask'd him, in what part of the World the Republick had found tho&s;e <HI>wing'd Lyons</HI> which are to be &s;een in its Coat of Arms, That he believ'd they found them in a certain Country where all the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Alluding to the Arms of the Empire.</NOTE> <HI>Eagles</HI> have <HI>two Heads.</HI> Moreover, the Lyon of St. <HI>Mark</HI> derives its original from <HI>Ezekiel</HI>'s Vi&s;ion<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">See Vol. <HI>1.</HI></NOTE>, which I have already mention'd in another place, and not, as you have been inform'd, from a pretended Me|tamorpho&s;is of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> who was turn'd to a Lyon, to extingui&s;h the ince&s;tuous Love of his Si&s;ter.</P>
<P N="3">III. I remember I told you, that the <HI>Air</HI> of <HI>Venice</HI> is good; but I mu&s;t confe&s;s that 'tis very bad in the <HI>Lagunas.</HI> And even I am credibly inform'd, that the Inhabitants of the little I&s;les are forc'd to leave their Habitations during the great Heats.</P>
<P N="4">IV. 'Tis &s;o univer&s;ally known, that the <HI>Doge</HI> of <HI>Venice</HI> continues for Life, whereas the <HI>Doge</HI> of <HI>Genoua</HI> is chang'd every two years, that I thought it needle&s;s to inform you of a thing which I pre&s;um'd you knew as well as I.</P>
<P>The Revenue of the <HI>Doge</HI> of <HI>Venice</HI> amounts to near<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Near Forty thou&s;and <HI>Livres Tournois.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Three thou&s;and Pounds Sterl.</HI> according
<PB N="5" REF="219">
to my be&s;t information. The pre&s;ent <HI>Doge</HI> is not marry'd. The <HI>Doge&s;&s;es</HI> are excluded from having any &s;hare in tho&s;e &s;hadows of Honour which are paid to their Husbands, which is an Effect of the Frugality of the Government; and indeed, the Republick has no need of two Mock-Soveraigns.</P>
<P N="5">V. In my former Letters I &s;aid nothing, or very little, concerning the <HI>Libertini&s;m</HI> and <HI>De|bauchery</HI> that reigns in the Mona&s;teries, becau&s;e I am not particularly acquainted with the Fa&s;hi|ons of tho&s;e places. I can only tell you what is generally known and acknowledg'd, That the Nuns receive Per&s;ons in Ma&s;querade at the Grate; that they put them&s;elves into all man|ner of Di&s;gui&s;es, that they go <HI>incognito</HI> to &s;ee Plays, and el&s;ewhere; that they joyn in publick Fea&s;ts, and have Tables made for that purpo&s;e, of which one half is within and the other with|out the Grate; that they are concern'd in a thou&s;and Intrigues, and are often the Principal Actors in them. I leave you to judge of their private Employments, for I am re&s;olv'd not to pry into them. As for the bouncing <HI>Brothers of the Cowle,</HI> they are &s;uch horrible Debauchees, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to fancy any Exce&s;s of which they are not guilty.</P>
<P N="6">VI. I am not at all &s;urpriz'd at your Friend's Exclamations again&s;t the Account that I gave you of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Government, and parti|cularly again&s;t the Soveraignty of the ancient <HI>Doges;</HI> but let him &s;trut and &s;wagger as he plea&s;es, 'tis folly either to deny or &s;trive to
<PB N="6" REF="220">
conceal a thing which is known to all the World.</P>
<P N="7">VII. According to the E&s;timate which &s;ome judicious and well inform'd Per&s;ons have made of the Revenues of this Republick, it has been computed, that reckoning one year with ano|ther, the total &s;um of all their Revenues, com|prehending al&s;o the &s;ale of <HI>Offices,</HI> and of <HI>Nobili|ty,</HI> Confi&s;cation of <HI>E&s;tates,</HI> and all other ca&s;ual Profits, amounts to no more than <HI>Six millions of Crowns.</HI> I will not undertake to warrant the exactne&s;s of this Calculation, but when you propo&s;e a Que&s;tion, you mu&s;t content your &s;elf with &s;uch an An&s;wer as I am able to re|turn.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. There are &s;ome <HI>Jews</HI> as <HI>Venice</HI> who drive a great Trade, e&s;pecially the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> who are very rich here, as well as at <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> and el&s;ewhere. That part of the City which is allotted to them is call'd <HI>il Ghetto,</HI> or the <HI>Jewry.</HI> They wear Hats cover'd with Scarlet, doubl'd and edg'd with Black; but the poorer &s;ort u&s;e wax'd Linnen in&s;tead of Cloth.</P>
<P N="9">IX. The number of tho&s;e <HI>Noblemen</HI> who are capacitated by their Age to be Members of the <HI>Great Council,</HI> may, as I am inform'd, amount to about <HI>One thou&s;and and Three hundred;</HI> but al|mo&s;t one half of them re&s;ide in other places, being employ'd either in Civil and Military Offices, or on Emba&s;&s;ies to foreign States; &s;o that the <HI>Great Council</HI> is u&s;ually compos'd of <HI>Six</HI> or <HI>Seven hundred</HI> Per&s;ons at mo&s;t: Yet even the&s;e
<PB N="7" REF="220">
are too many, and 'tis partly the numerou&s;ne&s;s of this A&s;&s;embly that has given occa&s;ion to this Proverb concerning <HI>Venice, Troppo Te&s;te, troppo Fe&s;te, troppo Tempe&s;te; Too many Heads, too many Fe&s;tivals, and too many Tempe&s;ts.</HI> Nor are the two la&s;t parts of this Apophthegm le&s;s true than the fir&s;t; for the number of <HI>Fe&s;tivals</HI> in <HI>Venice</HI> exceeds tho&s;e that are ob&s;erv'd in <HI>France</HI> by above a third part; and I am a&s;&s;ur'd that <HI>Storms</HI> happen very frequently here in the Summer.</P>
<P N="10">X.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Great Coun|cil was e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd in the Year <HI>1289.</HI> and all the Noblemen were regi&s;ter'd in that Li&s;t.</NOTE> The <HI>Golden Book</HI> which you mention is a bare Catalogue of Names, in which all the Sons of the Noblemen are enroll'd as &s;oon as they are born. All the Brothers have an equal Title to Nobility, and enjoy the &s;ame Privi|leges.</P>
<P>Before I leave this Head, I mu&s;t an&s;wer the Objection that was propos'd to you again&s;t the account that I gave you of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Noble|men, in which I repre&s;ented them as very haughty and almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible per&s;ons. Ju&s;tice obliges us to give a rea&s;onable Interpretation to every thing, and 'tis a ridiculous Victory that is obtain'd over imaginary Foes. 'Tis certain, that the Noblemen of <HI>Venice</HI> are extreamly con|ceited of their Nobility; nor will the Politicks of that Country permit them to be very affa|ble. 'Tis not an ea&s;ie matter for a <HI>Stranger,</HI> who&s;e Quality di&s;tingui&s;hes him from the Vul|gar, to get acce&s;s to them at their Hou&s;es, for they are only willing to be &s;een at the <HI>Broglio:</HI> Be&s;ides, tho' they cannot be accus'd of &s;pa|ringne&s;s in their <HI>Salutations,</HI> yet they u&s;ually treat the Citizens with a great deal of coldne&s;s,
<PB N="8" REF="221">
and appear always very re&s;erv'd in their com|pany: Neither are they wont to give and re|ceive Vi&s;its, even among them&s;elves. Thus you &s;ee that the Character that I gave of them was not &s;o injurious to them as &s;ome per&s;ons would have per&s;waded you; for all the&s;e are &s;hrewd &s;igns that they do not abound in Courte&s;ie: Neverthele&s;s it mu&s;t be acknowledg'd, that in private, when their Conveniency permits them, or at lea&s;t when their Intere&s;t obliges them, they can be as kind and civil as any Men what&s;oever. Neither is it altogether impo&s;&s;ible for a <HI>Stranger</HI> to obtain the Favour of a familiar Conver&s;a|tion with them, e&s;pecially when both the No|bleman and the Foreigner are per&s;ons of no great note. Moreover, I would not have you imagin that I de&s;ign'd only to break a Je&s;t when I told you that the <HI>great Sleeve</HI> does &s;ometimes &s;erve in&s;tead of a Basket, when a Nobleman goes to the Market; for I once &s;aw a large Sallad, and at another time a delicate Tail of a Cod thus honourably lodg'd. I know not whether I did not forget to tell you, that there are Two or Three hundred poor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">They are cal|led <HI>Barnabotes</HI> from the name of the place where they live, which is in a re|mote corner of the City, where the Hou&s;es are to be let at low rates.</NOTE> <HI>Barnabotes,</HI> who beg about the Streets, and in&s;tead of being at the charge of a <HI>Penny</HI> for the carriage of their &s;mall <HI>Provi&s;ions,</HI> would willingly turn <HI>Porters</HI> them|&s;elves, and earn a <HI>Penny</HI> by carrying the <HI>Provi|&s;ions</HI> of others. The&s;e poor Gentlemen &s;erve for a Foil to the rich Noblemen.</P>
<P>It is true, that in the Summer the Noblemen take away the Furs from that which you call the Ve&s;t, and we in French <HI>la Robe;</HI> but the Edges, and that part which is turn'd up, re|main &s;till furr'd.</P>

And is not their Condition more tole|rable, when they are &s;uffer'd to walk without di&s;turbance from one end of their Chamber to the other?

<P>In the year 1339. the Sea being furiou&s;ly agitated, three Men acco&s;ted a Gondolier, who was endeavourieg to pre&s;erve his Boat from the extraordinary Violence of the Waves; they con&s;train'd him to carry them two miles from

<P>Give me leave to trip from the <HI>Minerva</HI> to the <HI>Borghe&s;e</HI> Palace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">You mu&s;t &s;ee at the <HI>Minerva</HI> that famous Statue of Chri&s;t embracing the Cro&s;s, by <HI>Michael Angelo.</HI></NOTE> without obliging me to give you any other rea&s;on why I do &s;o, than that I mu&s;t follow my Journal thither. This Palace is very beautiful, and contains many Rarities. The Portico's are &s;upported by four&s;core and &s;ixteen Antique Pillars of <HI>Egyptian</HI> Granite. A|mong the Pictures in the lower Apart|ments, there are &s;eventeen hundred Ori|ginals by the mo&s;t celebrated Ma&s;ters: The <HI>Venus</HI> blindfolding <HI>Cupid,</HI> while the <HI>Graces</HI> bring him his Arms, is <HI>Titian</HI>'s, and is e&s;teem'd the be&s;t. <HI>Paul</HI> the Fifth, who was of this Family, is painted in &s;uch fine <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> Work, that his Picture is &s;aid to contain above a million of Pieces: My Calculation a&s;&s;ures me, that this cannot be true, but, without Critici&s;ing upon a Trifle, it mu&s;t be acknowledg'd that 'tis an excellent Picture. Here they &s;hew'd us a Crucifix of the &s;ame bigne&s;s with that of the <HI>Carthu&s;ians</HI> at <HI>Naples,</HI> and a&s;&s;ur'd us, that this is that famous Original of <HI>Michael Angelo,</HI> which I mention'd before. To reconcile this Difference, I think I may affirm, without any &s;cruple, that the whole &s;tory is a meer Fable.</P>
<P>It was the common <HI>People</HI> that gave the name of <HI>Rotonda</HI> to the <HI>Pantheon,</HI> becau&s;e of the roundne&s;s of its Figure. When <HI>Boniface</HI> the Fourth dedi|cated this ancient Temple to the <HI>Virgin</HI> and all
<PB N="22" REF="228">
the <HI>Martyrs,</HI> he nam'd it <HI>S. Maria ad Martyres.</HI> Afterwards &s;ome other <HI>Pope</HI> would have all the <HI>Saints</HI> in general comprehended with the <HI>Mar|tyrs.</HI> I mu&s;t ingenuou&s;ly acknowledge, that I cannot give you the &s;atisfaction you de&s;ire concerning the true rea&s;on why this Temple was of old call'd the <HI>Pantheon.</HI> Some &s;ay, that it had that name from the re&s;emblance between its Figure and that of the Heavens, <HI>Quod forma ejus convexa fa&s;tigiatam Coeli &s;imilitudinem o&s;tenderet.</HI> Others think that it was con&s;ecrated by <HI>Agrippa</HI> to <HI>Jupiter</HI> and all the Gods; or, perhaps to <HI>Ju|piter</HI> only, and to <HI>Cybele</HI> the Mother of the Gods: but after all, my opinion is, that this Contro|ver&s;ie is not well decided.</P>
<P>'Tis true, there are Niches all round the in&s;ide of the Temple, and I think we may rea|&s;onably conjecture, that the&s;e Niches were for|merly full of Idols, but this is the only Infe|rence that we can draw from them. <HI>Varro</HI> tells us of Thirty thou&s;and Deities that were wor&s;hip'd at <HI>Rome;</HI> and the Philo&s;opher <HI>Bruxil|lus,</HI> in his dying Speech to the <HI>Senate,</HI> a&s;&s;ur'd them, that he had left Two hundred and Eighty thou&s;and; &s;o that there mu&s;t have been a great number of Niches indeed to ac|commodate all tho&s;e Deities. Your Niches then will not furni&s;h you with one Argument to prove that the <HI>Pantheon</HI> was con&s;ecrated to all that multitude of Gods that were ador'd at <HI>Rome.</HI> Tho' this Temple hath lo&s;t its faire&s;t Ornaments, it is &s;till one of the mo&s;t beautiful and entire antique Edifices in <HI>Italy.</HI> There is to be &s;een at <HI>Ca&s;tle St. Angelo,</HI> of which I &s;hall quickly give you &s;ome account, a Cannon which

F. Nardin.</HI></NOTE> The Columns of this <HI>Portico</HI> are of Granite, of the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Order, and all of one piece. I mea&s;ur'd them with as much exactne&s;s as you could de&s;ire: they are not all equally big, but I found that they were fifteen foot in compa&s;s, within a few inches more or le&s;s: I give you the mea&s;ure of them in Engli&s;h feet, and you may judge of the re&s;t by the proportion that is between each part. That piece of Granite, in which the opening of the great Gate is cut, is al&s;o of a very con|&s;iderable bigne&s;s; for it is forty foot high, and very near twenty broad.</P>

will not exerci&s;e your patience with tedious de|&s;criptions of Churches, but &s;hall content my &s;elf to communicate to you &s;ome particular Ob|&s;ervations concerning them, as occa&s;ion &s;hall offer. That of St. <HI>Peter</HI> is generally e&s;teem'd to be the large&s;t and mo&s;t magnificent Temple in the World: He that would make a right judgment of it, mu&s;t go thither often; he mu&s;t even walk on the top of the Arches, and into the very Ball which is over the Dome, and mu&s;t al&s;o view the Church which is under Ground. At your fir&s;t entrance you &s;ee no &s;urprizing Objects; the harmony and proporti|ons of Architecture are &s;o judiciou&s;ly ob&s;erv'd, and every thing is plac'd &s;o exactly where it ought to be, that this unparallel'd Order does rather compo&s;e the Mind than di&s;turb its tran|quillity; but the longer you con&s;ider this va&s;t Structure, the more indi&s;pen&s;ably you will find your &s;elf oblig'd to admire it. Since you are willing to rely on my Fidelity and Diligence, rather than on tho&s;e who have already given you &s;ome dimen&s;ions of this Edifice, I will &s;end you the principal of them, as I mea&s;ur'd 'em my &s;elf more than once, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of skil|ful and experienc'd per&s;ons.

<P>If on one &s;ide the Pope may de&s;cend from this Palace to S. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Church, on the other he may e&s;cape un&s;een to the Ca&s;tle of St. <HI>Angelo. Alexander</HI> the Sixth built a Gallery of Commu|nication for this very purpo&s;e: and indeed, &s;uch a wicked man as that Pope was, had rea&s;on to provide for his &s;ecurity. <HI>&V;rban</HI> VIII. fortified the Ca&s;tle with four <HI>Ba&s;tions,</HI> and gave 'em the Names of the four <HI>Evangeli&s;ts.</HI> There is a Picture in the Chapel, which repre&s;ents <HI>Gregory</HI> the Fir&s;t with his triple Crown pro&s;trating him|&s;elf before an Angel that appears to him on the top of <HI>Adrian</HI>'s <HI>Mau&s;oleum,</HI> and puts up his Sword into its Sheath.

put to death. Among the re&s;t, they &s;how'd us <HI>Ranuccio Farne&s;e</HI>'s Pi&s;tols; I believe the Story of 'em will not be unwelcome to you, of which you may take the following brief Account, as I have heard it related by &s;everal per&s;ons here.</P>
<P><HI>Sixtus</HI> the Fifth having by repeated Orders expre&s;ly prohibited the carrying of &s;ecret Arms, was inform'd; that the young Prince <HI>Ranuccio,</HI> Son and Heir of <HI>Alexander Farne&s;e</HI> Duke of <HI>Par|ma</HI> and Governor of the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> went u&s;ually arm'd with Pocket-pi&s;tols.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A&s;perius nihil e&s;t humili qui &s;urgit in altum.</NOTE> The Pope, who was naturally the mo&s;t rigid and &s;evere man in the World, joyfully embrac'd all occa&s;ions to di&s;play the greatne&s;s of his Power, without re|garding who might be &s;ufferers by it. Be&s;ides, the Dutchy of <HI>Parma</HI> being a Fief of his De|means, he look'd on that Prince as his Va&s;&s;al: He commanded <HI>Ranuccio</HI> to be arre&s;ted, and to aggravate his Guilt, order'd his Pi&s;tols to be taken from him in one of the Chambers of the <HI>Pope</HI>'s Palace, as that Prince was going to de&s;ire an Audience of his Holine&s;s. <HI>Ranuccio</HI> was im|mediately carried to the Ca&s;tle of S. <HI>Angelo,</HI> and the Cardinal <HI>Farne&s;e</HI> his Uncle left no means une&s;&s;ay'd to procure his Liberty, but all in vain. Whether the <HI>Pope</HI> had re&s;olv'd on the Death of that poor <HI>Prince,</HI> or only intended to terrifie him, is a Que&s;tion which I cannot determine. How|ever, about Ten o'th' clock at night, at the &s;ame time that the Cardinal was return'd to re|new his &s;ollicitations, <HI>Sixtus</HI> &s;ent an expre&s;s Command to the Governor of the Ca&s;tle to cau&s;e <HI>Ranuccio</HI> to be beheaded; and not doubt|ing but that his Orders had been in&s;tantly exe|cuted, he rid him&s;elf of the Cardinal, by grant|ing
<PB N="35" REF="238">
him a new Order to the Governor, by which he commanded him to &s;et <HI>Ranuccio</HI> (whom he concluded to be already dead) at liberty at Ele|ven o'th' clock. The Cardinal, who was ig|norant of the fir&s;t Order, ran to the Ca&s;tle with|out lo&s;ing a moment, and was extreamly &s;ur|priz'd to find his Nephew all in Tears, in the Arms of a Confe&s;&s;or, and to hear that his Death had been only delay'd, becau&s;e he had begg'd a little time to prepare him&s;elf for it. The Governor &s;eeing this new Order, and conclu|ding that the Pope had at la&s;t yielded to the im|portunate &s;ollicitations of the Cardinal, deliver'd up his Pri&s;oner, who, by his Uncle's Command, immediately took po&s;t, and &s;o e&s;cap'd from the very Jaws of Death.</P>
<P>The Cavalier <HI>Borri,</HI> a <HI>Milane&s;e</HI> Gentleman, who is a great Chymi&s;t, and expert Phy&s;ician, is at pre&s;ent a Pri&s;oner in the Ca&s;tle of St. <HI>An|gelo;</HI> he is accus'd of &s;ome Heretical Opinions, but at the &s;ame time 'tis believ'd, that he is not perfectly Ma&s;ter of his Rea&s;on, which is the cau&s;e that he is not kept under a very clo&s;e confinement, and even is &s;ometimes permitted to vi&s;it per&s;ons of Quality in the City, who de&s;ire his a&s;&s;i&s;tance for the cure of their Di&s;tempers. We were inform'd, that he pretends to revive the Errors of the <HI>Collyridians</HI> in the Fourth Age, who paid a &s;ort of Adoration to the <HI>Virgin;</HI> and 'tis even reported, that he makes her a fourth per&s;on in the Godhead.</P>
<P>This man puts me in mind of Dr. <HI>Molinos,</HI> of whom you de&s;ire me to &s;end you &s;ome certain News, which 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for me to do. 'Tis true, I have &s;een tho&s;e Propo&s;itions that are
<PB N="36" REF="239">
either heretical, or pretended to be &s;o, of which he is &s;aid to be the Author; nor would it be very difficult to obtain a Copy of his Accu&s;a|tion; but all this &s;ignifies nothing. I mu&s;t hear <HI>Molinos</HI> him&s;elf, before I can judge of the merit of his cau&s;e: for, 'tis certain, that all the ac|counts that we have of him are guilty either of Aggravation or Alleviation. Of the&s;e Propo&s;i|tions, which I mention'd, &s;ome are dangerous, &s;everal are ambiguous, many indifferent, and others very rea&s;onable and orthodox. How|ever, I can a&s;&s;ure you, that his Reputation is generally very bad in this place: He is e&s;teem'd a Villain, a lewd Fellow, and a Seducer, who has &s;o cunningly in&s;inuated him&s;elf into Nunne|ries by his Cant of <HI>In&s;en&s;ibility, Exta&s;ie, &amp;c.</HI> that a great number of the&s;e poor Creatures have been deluded by him. They relate a thou&s;and Stories to confirm the Opinion they have of him, but I mu&s;t tell you once more that they are of doubtful Credit. We may ea&s;ily perceive that 'tis their Intere&s;t to blacken the Character of that unhappy Man, and to load him with Reproa|ches, &s;ince they have condemn'd him in &s;o igno|minious a manner to pa&s;s the re&s;t of his days in a Cell. Be&s;ides, I ob&s;erv'd, that even his bitte|re&s;t Enemies are wont to make a di&s;tinction be|tween him and his Followers. <HI>Molinos,</HI> they &s;ay, is void of all Religion and Virtue; he is a man of no Principles, and believes nothing at all, but there are &s;ome well-meaning <HI>Molini&s;ts,</HI> who are unacquainted with their Ma&s;ter's Heart, and are &s;incere Profe&s;&s;ors of that <HI>Quieti&s;m,</HI> and tho&s;e other Opinions, which you have heard &s;o often mention'd&punc;</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIV.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THAT I may ob&s;erve &s;ome Order in that variety of Matter which is the Subject of my Letters, I follow &s;ometimes my own Journal, and &s;ometimes yours. Some days ago <HI>M. B.</HI> made his Court to the Heroin, whom you mention, and was receiv'd with a great deal of Civility and Re&s;pect. The Company began immediately to talk of <HI>England,</HI> of its Court, the Excellency of the Country, the various Cu|&s;toms of the Inhabitants, and particularly the Liberty that is allow'd to the Women; the op|po&s;ition of their ea&s;ie and plea&s;ant manner of living in that Country to the perpetual con|finement of the poor <HI>Italian</HI> Ladies, made the condition of the&s;e la&s;t &s;eem doubly mi&s;erable. It was however alledg'd, That this Cu&s;tom which appears to be &s;o injurious to the beauti|ful Sex, is a nece&s;&s;ary piece of Caution in <HI>Italy,</HI> where three quarters of the Men living under the in&s;upportable re&s;traint of a forc'd Celibacy, would make a dreadful havock of their Neighbor's Property, if &s;ome means were not us'd to prevent &s;uch Di&s;orders. Why do we not then take St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Advice, reply'd one of the company, who exhorts every Man to have his own Wife, and every Woman her
<PB N="38" REF="240">
own Husband? But le&s;t we &s;hould have been in&s;en&s;ibly engag'd in <HI>Controver&s;ie,</HI> by continuing to talk on that Subject, the Di&s;cour&s;e was dex|terou&s;ly charg'd: And the Queen being in|form'd, that there was a <HI>French</HI> Gentleman in the company, ask'd News concerning the late Mi&s;&s;ion of Dragoons; and after &s;he had atten|tively heard his An&s;wer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">You may &s;ee the Letter which that Prince&s;s wrote on this Subject to the Chevalier <HI>de Terlon.</HI> It is in&s;erted in the <HI>Nouvelles de la Republique des Lettres,</HI> May <HI>1686.</HI></NOTE>, <Q>I knew all that you have told me, &s;aid &s;he, and have learn'd much more from the Mouths of Eye-witne&s;&s;es; and even <HI>Je&s;uites</HI> them&s;elves have given me an ac|count of<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">Not many months ago &s;ome <HI>German Je&s;uits</HI> told me, &s;aid the Queen, that they had &s;een Dragoons, <HI>Priapos &s;uos immanes in os faeminarum intromittentes, ibique urinam fundentes.</HI> I chid 'em &s;everely, added &s;he, for &s;uffering &s;uch horrible In&s;olency, but they only laugh'd at it.</NOTE> infamous Villanies; <HI>They have added Scoffing and In&s;olency to Treachery and Barbarity.</HI></Q>
After the&s;e words, and &s;ome particular Stories relating to the &s;ame Subject, we di&s;cours'd of the Pope, of his Health, and of his famous Dif|ference with the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>France</HI> about the <HI>Immu|nities,</HI> and at length the Queen withdrew.</P>
<P>You are not ignorant of the Learning and Merit of this Prince&s;s, but &s;ince you de&s;ire me to give you &s;ome account of her Per&s;on, I will make her Picture in few words. She is above &s;ixty years of age, of a very low &s;tature, extreme fat and thick: her Complexion, Voice, and Countenance are ma&s;culine, her No&s;e is great, her Eyes are large and blew, and her Eyebrows yellow; &s;he has a double Chin &s;trew'd with &s;ome long Hairs of a Beard, and her un|der Lip &s;ticks out a little. Her Hair is of a bright Che&s;nut colour, about a hand-breadth long, powder'd and bri&s;tl'd up, without any
<PB N="39" REF="240">
Head-dre&s;s; &s;he has a &s;miling Air, and is very obliging. As for her Habit, imagine a Man's <HI>Ju&s;taucor</HI> of black Sattin, reaching to the Knee, and button'd quite down; a very &s;hort black Coat, which di&s;covers a Man's Shoe; a great knot of black Ribbon in&s;tead of a Cravat, and a Girdle above the <HI>Ju&s;taucor,</HI> which keeps up her Belly, and makes its roundne&s;s fully ap|pear.</P>
<P>After the Queen had left us, we vi&s;ited the principal Apartments of her<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">She lives in the Palace <HI>Riari.</HI></NOTE> Palace, where we found a great number of Pictures and other Antique Pieces of rare and exqui&s;ite beauty; I &s;hall only name &s;ome part of 'em to you at pre&s;ent; as, the <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> of Oriental Alaba&s;ter, tran&s;parent as Amber; the Head and Feet are additional Pieces, of Bra&s;s gilt, but the re&s;t is very entire. The &s;ixteen ancient Columns of <HI>Giallo,</HI> with two Pillars of Oriental Alaba&s;ter &s;e|ven foot high, the fine&s;t Agat cannot look fairer. The <HI>Venus,</HI> which might contend for the Golden Apple with that at <HI>Florence,</HI> if her Legs had not been mangl'd by that general Devourer, Time. 'Tis true, they have &s;upply'd the&s;e Defects by the addition of new pieces, which are &s;o admirably well fitted to the re&s;t, that 'tis almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to perceive that they have been added. The <HI>Ca&s;tor and Pollux</HI> on each &s;ide of their Mother <HI>Leda,</HI> all of one piece of Marble; the Sons are bigger than the Mo|ther, and &s;he has but one of her <HI>Eggs.</HI> The Altar of <HI>Bacchus</HI> of fine white Marble, and adorn'd with excellent Sculptures in <HI>Ba&s;&s;o relievo.</HI> I took notice of the old <HI>Silenus,</HI> who has carous'd &s;o briskly at the Fe&s;tival of his Fo&s;ter-child, that

<P>It would be an endle&s;s Labour to de&s;cribe all the rare <HI>Medals</HI> that we &s;aw in this Palace, but &s;ince I promis'd to leave no &s;ubject wholly un|touch'd, I &s;hall only name the <HI>Otho</HI> of Bra&s;s an <HI>Egyptian</HI> Medal, which has on the rever&s;e the Image of <HI>Serapis;</HI> the <HI>Pertinax,</HI> a little <HI>Latin</HI> Medal, on the rever&s;e of which that Emperor is repre&s;ented offering a Sacrifice; the <HI>Antoninus Pius,</HI> having on the rever&s;e <HI>Hercules</HI> &s;itting and <HI>Diana</HI> &s;tanding; another <HI>Antoninus Pius,</HI> being a little <HI>Latin</HI> Medal, which has on the rever&s;e the &s;ame Emperor crown'd by <HI>Victory</HI> and <HI>Abundance,</HI> bringing him Fruit: this Medal has been well kept, and is in very good condition, in which its value principally con&s;i&s;ts: a third little <HI>Latin</HI>

I cannot forbear giving you &s;ome ac|count of it. The Pyramid is &s;quare, and ends in a very &s;harp point; it is a hundred and twenty foot high, and ninety four foot broad at the Ba&s;e. The Body of the Monument is of Brick, but cover'd over with &s;quare pieces of white Marble.

This Chamber is plai&s;ter'd over with a certain white and poli&s;h'd Mortar, on which there are &s;till &s;een &s;everal Figures of Women, Ve&s;&s;els, and other Ornaments. I will not undertake to de|&s;cribe all the&s;e things particularly; much le&s;s will I attempt to write a Di&s;&s;ertation on &s;o diffi|cult a &s;ubject; I will only tell you, that ha|ving had the fortune to di&s;cour&s;e &s;everal times with learned Antiquaries concerning the&s;e Pi|ctures, I found their Opinions very different: &s;ome pretend, that in re&s;pect to the Monument they repre&s;ent the Preparatives for a Funeral Show; and others think, that they contain a repre&s;entation of a Banquet, as a Memorial al|luding to the Office of the Deceas'd. One of the Figures holds a Ve&s;&s;el, in which &s;ome pour Lu&s;tral Water, and others Wine Another Figure
<PB N="51" REF="246">
bears great Pipes, which, according to the fir&s;t Opinion, were de&s;ign'd for Mirth, and accor|ding to the la&s;t, for Mourning; and both the di&s;agreeing Parties pretend, with equal proba|bility, to confirm their Suppo&s;itions by this Di|&s;tick in <HI>Ovid</HI>'s <HI>Fa&s;ts:</HI>

<P>But one thing e&s;pecially &s;eems to confirm the latter Opinion, if I may be permitted to declare my Thoughts on this &s;ubject, namely, That the Habits of the Figures are of &s;everal colours, which does not at all agree with the Funeral Ceremonies that were us'd in tho&s;e times. It appears by the In&s;cription of a Pede&s;tal that was dug up near the Pyramid, and on which a Statue of <HI>Ce&s;tius</HI> &s;eems to have been plac'd, that this <HI>Roman</HI> dy'd in the beginning of <HI>Augu|&s;tus</HI>'s Reign; and tho&s;e who have enquir'd in|to the Cu&s;toms of that Age, a&s;&s;ure us, that the Women who a&s;&s;i&s;ted at Burials were cloth'd in white, and that the Fa&s;hion of Mourning in black was aboli&s;h'd about the beginning of <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s Dictator&s;hip. Be&s;ides, I know not what &s;hould hinder me from adventuring to main|tain that the&s;e Pictures were only de&s;ign'd for an Ornament of the Tomb, without regard ei|ther

to Fea&s;t or Funeral. The Sepulchre of the <HI>Na&s;e</HI>'s, &s;o exactly de&s;crib'd by Mr. <HI>Bellori,</HI> is al&s;o full of Hi&s;tories and other Ornaments, which are the meer product of the <HI>Painter</HI>'s Fancy.

<P>This Pyramid is Two hundred paces di&s;tant from the little Hill commonly call'd <HI>il Doliolo,</HI> or <HI>Monte Te&s;tacio,</HI> that is, <HI>The Hill of Pot&s;heards.</HI> This Hillock is about half a mile in compa&s;s, and a hundred and fifty foot in perpendicular heighth. Tho&s;e who treat of &s;uch Curio&s;ities differ much in their &s;uppo&s;itions concerning this great heap of broken Pots, but the mo&s;t general Opinion is this: The Hillock being near the <HI>Tiber,</HI> 'tis &s;uppos'd that all the Potters wrought in this place, both for the nearne&s;s of the Wa|ter, which is of nece&s;&s;ary u&s;e in their Employ|ment, and for the conveniency of tran&s;porting their Ware. 'Tis al&s;o believ'd that they threw all the broken pieces of their Ve&s;&s;els into one place; and this &s;uppo&s;ition is confirm'd by ano|ther Conjecture, That they might have an
<PB N="53" REF="247">
expre&s;s Order for &s;o doing, to prevent the inun|dation of the River on that &s;ide. And they conclude, that if we con&s;ider the va&s;t number of Idols, Ornaments of Temples, Bathing-tubs, Statues, Vats, Tyles, and all &s;orts of Ve&s;&s;els that were made in the great City of <HI>Rome,</HI> it will not appear &s;trange, that the above|mention'd Hillock was rais'd out of their Frag|ments. This &s;uppo&s;ition &s;eems rea&s;onable at the fir&s;t view, but, in my opinon, it is not well grounded, becau&s;e the Authors of it have not examin'd the matter with due attention.</P>
<P>Some Wine-Merchants have thought fit to dig Cellars under this Hill, to pre&s;erve their Wines cool: and I have been pre&s;ent &s;everal times, and in &s;everal places, when they were at work in digging the&s;e Caves, &s;o that I had both Time and Opportunity to con&s;ider all that they drew out of them, yet I could never find any Fragments of Images, Tyles, or Orna|ments, nor any Remainder, or the lea&s;t appea|rance of tho&s;e things that I mention'd. And in more than twenty Cartloads of the&s;e broken pieces, I ob&s;erv'd only Fragments of Urns, or at the lea&s;t of Ve&s;&s;els that &s;eem'd to have been Urns; which being &s;uppos'd, we mu&s;t proceed to e&s;tabli&s;h more probable Conjectures.</P>
<P>'Tis well known, that in ancient times only the poore&s;t &s;ort of People were buried with|out the City, in certain Pits call'd <HI>Puticuli.</HI> The Cu&s;tom of burning dead Bodies continu'd very long, during which time there was made a prodigious quantity of Earthen Urns for the ordinary &s;ort of people; and 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to conceive that all the care that was taken to pre|&s;erve
<PB N="54" REF="248">
'em could prevent their being frequently broken. May it not then be &s;uppos'd, that out of reverence to tho&s;e Ve&s;&s;els, which had been employ'd to &s;o &s;acred an u&s;e, and might &s;till contain &s;ome part of the A&s;hes of the Dead, that &s;uper&s;titious people e&s;teem'd it a Duty of Religion to gather all the&s;e Fragments, and lay 'em in heaps together?

<P>I'm &s;orry that I cannot relate to you &s;o many Wonders of <HI>Tivoli</HI> and <HI>Fre&s;cati</HI> as you &s;eem to expect. They are indeed very <HI>plea&s;ant</HI> places, and rather than give offence, I will e'en adven|ture to call 'em <HI>fine places.</HI> But, if once this Maxim be e&s;tabli&s;h'd, That when we con&s;ider things which are reputed beautiful, we ought
<PB N="59" REF="253">
to proportion the E&s;teem that we have for 'em, by comparing 'em one with another; as, the beauty of Ro&s;es and Gilliflowers does &s;o darken the fainter lu&s;tre of a Field-Dai&s;ie, that we pa&s;s by it without reflexion. If, I &s;ay, this Principle be laid down, I mu&s;t &s;incerely ac|knowledge, that if we compare <HI>Fre&s;cati</HI> to <HI>Ver|&s;ailles,</HI> or even to &s;everal other plea&s;ant Seats in <HI>France,</HI> that are not Royal Hou&s;es, I am per|&s;waded, and dare po&s;itively affirm, that the ce|lebrated Wonders not only of <HI>Fre&s;cati,</HI> but al&s;o of <HI>Tivoli,</HI> and all the mo&s;t beautiful places about <HI>Rome,</HI> I mean as to Gardens and Water-works, de&s;erve no higher Title than that of <HI>Pretty Toys.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fre&s;cati</HI> is a very &s;mall Town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">FRESCATI, <HI>anciently call'd</HI> Tu&s;culum.</NOTE> &s;eated on the Brow of a Hill, twelve miles from <HI>Rome.</HI> There are &s;everal Hou&s;es of Plea&s;ure in it, of which the three principal are <HI>Monte-dracone,</HI> belonging to the Prince <HI>Borghe&s;e, Belvedere</HI> to the Prince <HI>Pamphilio,</HI> and the <HI>Villa Ludovi&s;ia</HI> to the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Guadagnola</HI> the Con&s;table <HI>Colonna</HI>'s Si&s;ter; and all de&s;erve no more to be compar'd to <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> than <HI>Fre&s;cati</HI> to <HI>Rome,</HI> or two or three Trees to a fine Landskip.</P>
<P><HI>Monte-dracone</HI> is a large Structure, &s;ituated on a ri&s;ing Ground, from which you may di&s;|cover <HI>Rome</HI> and the whole extent of the inter|jacent Plain; but that City is at too great a di&s;tance to be &s;een from hence with plea&s;ure, and the Verdure of the Plain is too uniform and unadorn'd with that variety of Beauties with which a Landskip ought to be embelli&s;h'd. The view of <HI>Paris</HI> from <HI>S. Clou</HI> is infinitely
<PB N="60" REF="254">
more charming. 'Tis true, the Pro&s;pect is more diver&s;ify'd on the &s;ide of <HI>Monte-Porcio,</HI> but 'tis al&s;o much more limited. The Avenues of this Hou&s;e are very difficult; and, to &s;peak plainly, there are at pre&s;ent neither Fountains nor Gardens about it, that merit a particular de|&s;cription.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of <HI>Belvedere</HI> is not unlike to that of <HI>Monte-dracone.</HI> There is a pretty Ca&s;|cade in it, and a Grotto, where you may &s;ee <HI>Apollo</HI> with the <HI>Nine Mu&s;es</HI> on Mount <HI>Parna&s;&s;us.</HI> We were inform'd, that all the&s;e Statues play'd on Pipes, when the Machins were in order.</P>

'Twould be certainly very unju&s;t to refu&s;e the Prai&s;es that are due to a place, which if it be con&s;ider'd &s;ingly and by its &s;elf, mu&s;t be acknowledg'd to have a great many Charms, and to contain a great number of Curio&s;ities: Neither do I pre|tend in the lea&s;t to derogate from its true value: My de&s;ign is only to give a ju&s;t Idea of it, and to remove tho&s;e Prejudices with which ma|ny per&s;ons are po&s;&s;e&s;s'd concerning it.

<P>The Hill of <HI>Tivoli</HI> has furni&s;h'd, Time out of Mind, the greate&s;t part of the Stones that are us'd at <HI>Rome.</HI> This Stone is u&s;ually call'd <HI>Travertin,</HI> by corruption of the word <HI>Tyburtin.</HI> The <HI>Colli&s;ea</HI> was cover'd all over with it, and the Front of <HI>S.

<P>Three miles from <HI>Tivoli,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lacus Albuneus.</NOTE> in our way home|wards, we pa&s;s'd by a little Lake call'd <HI>Lago de Bagni,</HI> or <HI>Solfatara,</HI> and by the People nam'd the <HI>Sixteen Barges,</HI> becau&s;e of a like number of floating I&s;lands that are upon it. It re&s;embles a Pond, being almo&s;t round, and Two hundred paces in diameter: its Water is extream clear, and &s;eems to be of a very blew colour. It &s;ends forth a pretty large Brook, which, after a &s;hort and rapid cour&s;e, lo&s;es it &s;elf in the <HI>Anieno.</HI> Both the Lake and Rivulet exhale a &s;ulphureous odour, which is very &s;trong,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They pretend that the Water of the <HI>Anieno</HI> is endow'd with a &s;ingular Vertue to whiten the Teeth, and Ivory. <HI>Schrad.</HI></NOTE> and is &s;melt at a great di&s;tance. The late Cardinal <HI>d' E&s;te</HI> having in vain attempted to &s;ound the depth of this Lake, per&s;waded two Divers to enter into it, one of whom was never after|wards &s;een, and the other related, that he found the Water &s;o hot, tho' at the &s;urface it is cold, that he was not able to de&s;cend to any con&s;i|derable depth. The Land is dry and hollow underneath about the Banks of the Lake, as it appears by the deaf &s;ound made by the tread|ing of Hor&s;es upon it. 'Tis probable that the vi&s;ible part of the Lake is only a narrow Mouth of a va&s;t Aby&s;s, which widens and extends it &s;elf under Ground very far on both &s;ides. And I think it may be conjectur'd concerning the fir&s;t Diver, that either he ventur'd too deep, and was &s;urpriz'd by the heat of the Water, or that having wander'd into &s;ome &s;ubterraneous Gulf, he &s;truck his Head again&s;t the impend|ing Arch, in&s;tead of ri&s;ing at the Mouth of
<PB N="64" REF="256">
the Lake. But not to in&s;i&s;t upon the fir&s;t con|jecture, we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily conclude, that the Body was carried into &s;ome &s;ubterraneal Vault, &s;ince it never afterwards appear'd on the &s;urface of the Water.</P>
<P>On the Bank of this Lake we &s;aw certain old Ruins, which Antiquaries call the Baths of <HI>Agrippa.</HI> The large&s;t of the floating I&s;lands makes a perfect Oval, and is about fifteen foot long; they are &s;till crowded together on that &s;ide whither the Wind drives 'em; and the lea&s;t touch puts 'em in motion. Two of our Company went into one of the &s;malle&s;t of 'em, and pu&s;h'd it from the Land only by thru&s;ting again&s;t the Bank with the points of their Swords.</P>
<P>I have &s;everal other Ob&s;ervations to commu|nicate to you concerning the principal Hou&s;es of Plea&s;ure in <HI>Rome,</HI> tho' I do not de&s;ign to de&s;cribe 'em particularly, as I intimated to you before.</P>
<P>The <HI>Villa Borghe&s;e</HI> is, in my Opinion, kept in better order than any that I have hitherto &s;een. 'Tis certainly a very plea&s;ant place, and fit for a great Prince.

and a more regular di&s;po&s;ition of all the Parts than any where el&s;e. The Hou&s;e is adorn'd on the out&s;ide with fine Antique <HI>Ba&s;&s;o relievo's,</HI> like that of the <HI>Villa Borghe&s;e,</HI> and it is no le&s;s repleni&s;h'd within; but the be&s;t Statues were very much di&s;order'd by an Accident which I &s;hall relate to you. The Prince <HI>Pam|philio,</HI> while he was yet very young, was im|portunately &s;ollicited by the Je&s;uites to enter into their Society. He was not altogether aver&s;e to this motion, and tho&s;e de&s;igning Fathers em|ploy'd all their Cunning to gain him under a Pretext of Devotion, to which they knew he was very much enclin'd. Among other Strata|gems which they us'd, they exclaim'd loudly again&s;t the Indecency of tho&s;e naked Marble Figures which he kept in this Palace; and the tender Con&s;ciences of the&s;e rigid Ca&s;ui&s;ts oblig'd him at length to order &s;everal parts of the&s;e Statues to be cover'd. This poor young Prince, to humour his gho&s;tly Fathers, caus'd Shirts of Pla&s;ter to be put on all his Marble Subjects, Men, Women, and Children. This Reformation was very grievous to &s;ome per&s;ons, e&s;pecially to Painters, Sculptors, and Antiquaries, but no humane Con&s;ideration could prevail with the Prie&s;t-ridden Prince to de&s;i&s;t from his pious de|&s;ign to hide &s;o many tempting and dangerous Objects. They were all daub'd and pla&s;ter'd over without mercy, &s;ave one little <HI>Bacchus,</HI> who had the good fortune to e&s;cape this holy Fury as the young<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">He was after|wards made a Duke.</NOTE> Lord of <HI>Force</HI> was pre&s;erv'd from that of the <HI>Pari&s;ian</HI> Ma&s;&s;acre.

and transform'd into I know not how many Fi|gures, which fill at pre&s;ent the corner of a Pi|cture of which &s;he was formerly the faire&s;t Ornament.</P>
<P>But the Prince having at la&s;t chang'd his Mind, and being re&s;olv'd to prefer the Com|pany of his Prince&s;s to that of the <HI>Society,</HI> was de&s;irous to redre&s;s all the&s;e Di&s;orders, and to re&s;tore his good People to their ancient Privi|leges. In pur&s;uance of this de&s;ign, he order'd the na&s;ty Clay with which they were cover'd to be taken off; but the clum&s;y-fi&s;ted Ma&s;ons had unfortunately mangl'd &s;everal parts of the Mar|ble to make their Pla&s;ter &s;tick the better; &s;o that the greate&s;t part of the&s;e curious Pieces were very much damag'd.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not forget to tell you, that I ob&s;erv'd at the <HI>Villa Savelli,</HI> an unu&s;ual Figure of <HI>Abra|ham</HI>'s <HI>Sacrifice</HI> by <HI>l'E&s;pagnolet;</HI> for, whereas <HI>I&s;aac</HI> is commonly painted on his Knees, and blind-folded, and his Father with a &s;hort two-handed Sword, like a <HI>Switzer</HI>'s, or with a Turki&s;h Sci|mitar, ready to cut off his Son's Head like a <HI>Frenchman; L'E&s;pagnolet</HI> has only given him a plain &s;acrificing Knife, as if he were going to cut <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s Throat; which certainly agrees better with the Truth of the Hi&s;tory.</P>

<P>I &s;hall begin this Letter by an&s;wering the Que&s;tions you Propo&s;e concerning the <HI>Tiber.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Tiber</HI> was formerly call'd <HI>Rumon, Teren|tus,</HI> and <HI>Albula.</HI> It receives forty Rivers before its arrival at <HI>Rome, Martian.</HI></NOTE> 'Tis certain that this River has nothing in its &s;elf that could have render'd it &s;o famous as it has been; and without doubt it ows the Honour it has to be &s;o generally known, to the Reputa|tion of that Noble City which it waters, unle&s;s per|haps &s;ome part of its Fame may be a&s;crib'd to the noi&s;e which its frequent Inundations have made in the World: Neverthele&s;s it mu&s;t be acknow|ledg'd that it has been often treated with too much contempt; the great Rivers are jealous of its Glory, and would have it pa&s;s for a muddy Brook, &s;uch as I perceive it has been repre&s;en|ted to you. But you may rec|kon that,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bridg of <HI>S. Angelo</HI> is <HI>330</HI> foot long; and that of <HI>Sixtus 300.</HI> Some Antiquaries affirm that it was not lawful to build Hou&s;es on the Banks of the <HI>Tiber,</HI> out of re|&s;pect to that &s;acred River. But this is an Error, which might be ea&s;ily refuted. <HI>Clandian</HI> and &s;eve|ral other Authors have left po&s;i|tive accounts of the great number of noble Structures that were erect|ed on the Banks of this River. The greate&s;t Inundation happen'd under <HI>Clement VIII.</HI> in the Month of <HI>December 1598.</HI></NOTE> by a general Compu|tation, the breadth of the <HI>Tiber</HI> at <HI>Rome</HI> amounts to about three hundred Feet; and be&s;ides it is rapid and of a great depth. <HI>Sue|tonius</HI> relates, that <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> caus'd it to be cleans'd, and &s;omewhat enlarg'd it's Chanel to facilitate it's Cour&s;e. Other Princes have al&s;o endeavour'd to prevent the Di&s;orders that attend it's Inun|dations, but with little or no Succe&s;s. The <HI>Sirocco
<PB N="72" REF="261">
Levante,</HI> which is the <HI>South-Ea&s;t</HI> of the <HI>Mediterra|nean,</HI> and is here call'd the <HI>Sea Wind,</HI> does &s;ome|times blow with &s;o terrible an Impetuo&s;ity, that it drives back, or at lea&s;t &s;tops, the Waters of the <HI>Tiber</HI> at it's Mouth. And when it happens at the &s;ame time, that the melted Snow of the <HI>A|pennins</HI> &s;wells the Torrents, which fall into that River, or the &s;ame effect is produc'd by continu|al Rains; the Conjunction of the&s;e various Ac|cidents mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily increa&s;e its Waters, and cau&s;e tho&s;e Inundations, which may be term'd the Scourge of <HI>Rome,</HI> as the fiery Eruptions of <HI>Ve&s;uvius</HI> are call'd the Scourge of <HI>Naples.</HI> There are In&s;criptions fa&s;ten'd in &s;everal Places again&s;t the Walls to denote the Year and Height of the Inundations.</P>
<P>The Water of this River is always thick and yellowi&s;h; but if it be &s;uffer'd to &s;tand a whole night it grows clear and limpid, and they a&s;&s;ur'd us al&s;o that 'tis very good. Neverthele&s;s I per|ceive that &s;ome Per&s;ons in all Ages have been at prodigious charge to bring other Waters to <HI>Rome,</HI> in order to which they have diverted the cour&s;e of Rivers, pierc'd Mountains, and built great Aqueducts. And they continue &s;till to make new Attempts to compa&s;s the &s;ame de|&s;ign. The <HI>Aqua Felice</HI> was twenty Miles di|&s;tant from <HI>Rome,</HI> and co&s;t Pope <HI>Sixtus the</HI> V. near four hundred thou&s;and Crowns to bring it thither.

In the middle of this Chappel they have made a deep hole where they affirm the Cro&s;s was fixt. You know what <HI>Platina</HI> and others have related that St. <HI>Peter</HI> de&s;ir'd to be crucify'd with his Head down-ward, not e&s;teeming him&s;elf worthy to &s;uffer in the &s;ame manner with <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> The Picture of this Crucifixion is to be &s;een at St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>at the three Fountains,</HI> by the hand of <HI>Guido:</HI> And in the &s;ame Church they &s;how the Pillar, on which they pretend St. <HI>Paul</HI> was beheaded.

by a Ho&s;t which flew out of the Hands of an Incredulous Per&s;on, nor of the other Curio&s;ities that are to be &s;een under the Portico's of this Cloy&s;ter.

'Tis a kind of arm'd Chair of one &s;ingle Piece of Porphy|ry.</P>
<P>Whether the Rea&s;on and End of that &s;earch gave occa&s;ion to the ancient u&s;e of this Chair; or it was made only to put the Popes in mind that they were not Gods, but Men, and &s;ubject to all human infirmities; or whether that Cere|mony was ordain'd for both the&s;e ends together, as <HI>Platina</HI> &s;eems to think, who &s;peaks very ob&s;cure|ly on this occa&s;ion, is a Controver&s;y which I am as willing as you, to leave undecided. But as for the <HI>She-Pope</HI> I am re&s;olv'd to take another Cour&s;e, and &s;ince you have given me a fair oc|ca&s;ion to add &s;ome Reflexions to all that has been &s;aid, by &s;o many different Per&s;ons on this &s;ubject, I mu&s;t tell you freely, that I find not the lea&s;t &s;olidity either in your Objections, or any of tho&s;e that have been rais'd by others again&s;t the Truth of this Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="262">'Tis true, &s;ome <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Authors have reje|cted it as a Fable, as well as the <HI>Roman Catholic</HI> Doctors of the&s;e la&s;t Ages: Whether the For|mer did really e&s;teem it to be &s;uch, or were acted by a Spirit of Singularity, or a certain &s;ort of Complai&s;ance which might have been very well &s;par'd, I will not pretend to determine; but e|very Man will have his humor: And you mu&s;t not blame me, if I am re&s;olv'd to believe my own Eyes. Let us con&s;ider the matter of Fact then, and examin the Arguments on both &s;ides, with all po&s;&s;ible Brevity.</P>
<P>I cannot perceive the lea&s;t &s;hadow of a Rea|&s;on, that &s;hould hinder us from ranking this Ad|venture among an infinite number of other ex|traordinary Events recorded in Hi&s;tory, to which we cannot without Inju&s;tice refu&s;e to give credit. We find<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Blondel ac|knowledges <HI>Se|venty one Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin,</HI> Cano|niz'd Writers and others.</NOTE> Seventy or Eighty Authors, who have at &s;everal times related the &s;ame thing. The&s;e Authors are Men of Sen&s;e, whom no con&s;ide|ration, either of Profit or Honour, could have prompted to make &s;uch a Declaration: Quite the contrary, the Intere&s;t of their Religion, and Fear of Puni&s;hment might have deter'd 'em from publi&s;hing that Adventure. What Folly then, or rather Madne&s;s mu&s;t we &s;uppo&s;e &s;o many grave Authors to have been &s;eiz'd with, which could intice 'em to invent a Fable of this na|ture, with all the Circum&s;tances that attend it: And what Evidence or Authority can henceforth per&s;wade us to believe that which we never &s;aw.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t acknowledg it to be my Opinion, that the aiery and humorous Wit of Incredulity ne|ver made a wor&s;e Figure than on this occa&s;ion.<PB N="76" REF="263">
But you will perhaps tell me that they do not in|&s;i&s;t upon a bare Negation of the matter of Fact, but that they alledge &s;everal weighty Arguments to confirm their Opinion, which de&s;erve to be con&s;idered, and that after a careful and &s;erious Examination of the whole Controver&s;ie, they find rea&s;on to conclude that the Hi&s;tory of the pretended <HI>She-Pope</HI> is an ill-contriv'd Fable.</P>
<P>Very well, Sir, I will hear the&s;e boa&s;ted Argu|ments, immediatly, and perhaps confute 'em too; but fir&s;t give me leave to tell you, that when a matter of Fact which does not imply a Con|tradiction, is po&s;itively atte&s;ted by &s;ufficient Au|thority; we mu&s;t not pretend to call the Truth of the Hi&s;tory in que&s;tion, meerly on the Score of certain Critici&s;ms, on &s;ome intricate and not com|mon Pa&s;&s;ages in it. In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e we pro|duce a multitude of Authors of undoubted Cre|dit, who confirm the Truth of our A&s;&s;ertion; and all your halfdifficulties can never invalidate the Te&s;timony of &s;o many credible Witne&s;&s;es.

In&s;tances of &s;uch Variations.

<P>During our &s;hort &s;tay at this place, we took &s;everal turns into the adjacent Country: About a mile from the Ca&s;tle we vi&s;ited the little Town of <HI>Albano,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ALBANO.</NOTE> where the famous City of <HI>Alba</HI> was formerly &s;eated, extending, accord|ing to the common Belief, from the brink of the Lake of <HI>Ca&s;tle Gandolfo</HI> to the new Town of <HI>Albano;</HI> but this Opinion is controverted, and I will not undertake to decide the Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>We &s;aw at <HI>Albano</HI> a kind of Tower or ruin'd <HI>Mau&s;oleum,</HI> commonly call'd the <HI>Tomb of A&s;canius;</HI> but this Opinion &s;eems only to be grounded on a very uncertain Tradition.</P>
<P>But <HI>I</HI> may &s;peak more po&s;itively of another ancient Tomb near <HI>Albano,</HI> which is generally believ'd to be the Sepulchre of the <HI>Two Horatii,</HI>
<PB N="89" REF="269">
and the <HI>Three Curiatii.</HI> 'Tis plain, that the <HI>Five Pyramids</HI> which are on the Tomb have given occa&s;ion to this Opinion; but this Rea&s;on is of no force, for <HI>Titus Livius</HI> expre&s;ly affirms, That the Sepulchres of the&s;e <HI>Heroes</HI> were erected in the &s;ame places where each of 'em expir'd; tho&s;e of the <HI>Horatii</HI> towards <HI>Alba,</HI> and tho&s;e of the <HI>Curiatii</HI> nearer <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Lake</HI> of <HI>Ca&s;tel Gandolfo</HI> is, as we were inform'd, &s;ix or &s;even miles in compa&s;s; and the ri&s;ing Grounds which environ it form an exact <HI>Amphitheater.</HI> There are two parts where the depth of the Lake cannot be &s;ounded; but, which is more wonderful, its Waters do from time to time &s;uddenly &s;well, and ri&s;e to the very top of the Banks, which doubtle&s;s proceeds from its communication with &s;ubterraneous Gulfs, that di&s;gorge them&s;elves into it.</P>

<P>Between <HI>Albano</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;tel-Gandolfo,</HI> we ob|&s;erv'd the Ruins of an <HI>Amphitheater,</HI> and were &s;urpriz'd to behold certain great Trees among 'em, that had formerly taken root, and, in a wonderful manner, wrought a pa&s;&s;age for them|&s;elves between the be&s;t cemented Stones and Bricks, which they have cleft a&s;under, and pierc'd the Walls, where they are grown great in &s;pite of all oppo&s;ition.</P>

<P>Perhaps I &s;hould not have had the Courage &s;ingly to attack that common Prejudice that puts the Reputation of <HI>Raphael</HI> in a <HI>Threepenny Di&s;h,</HI> which he never &s;aw or touch'd; tho' I am pretty well acquainted with the Hi&s;tory of that Arti&s;t, and had &s;everal good Arguments to confute that Opinion.

<P>The other Palace <HI>Barberini</HI> towards the <HI>four Fountains,</HI> is a heap of Rarities, Antiquities, and all &s;orts of Curio&s;ities. They a&s;&s;ur'd us, that its Library contains Forty thou&s;and Volumes.</P>

<P>I will not in&s;i&s;t upon the Architecture of the&s;e <HI>Palaces,</HI> for I'm per&s;waded I cannot inform you of any thing of that nature, with which you are not already acquainted. I think I told you before, that 'tis much more u&s;ual in this place to cover the Hou&s;es with ridg'd than flat Roofs, tho' people generally differ much in their Opinions concerning the&s;e two ways of building. Tho&s;e &s;harp-pointed Roofs that are almo&s;t equal in heighth to the Body of the Edifice, are in &s;ome mea&s;ure contrary to Rea|&s;on, by de&s;troying the &s;ymmetry and decent proportion that ought to be between the whole, or at lea&s;t the main body, and the other le&s;s remarkable parts of a Building. But, &s;ince you are de&s;irous to know my Opinion, I mu&s;t
<PB N="94" REF="272">
tell you, that I prefer the middle way found out by our famous <HI>Man&s;ard</HI> before your flat Roofs.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, you mu&s;t give me leave to entreat you to lay a&s;ide that partial Opinion you &s;eem to have of the <HI>Roman Architecture</HI> in gene|ral. It mu&s;t be acknowledg'd, that there are in this place very beautiful Structures, both ancient and modern, but you mu&s;t not imagine that every thing is in perfection; for here, as well as in other places, there are certain modes of Building peculiar to the Age and Country, and not at all conformable either to the Regu|larity or Magnificence of Architecture.</P>
<P>I thank you for your excellent Remarks on tho&s;e admirable <HI>Egyptian Obelisks,</HI> which are at pre&s;ent to be &s;een in this City, and ought, in my Opinion, to be reckon'd among its noble&s;t Ornaments. I have learn'd many cu|rious things from what you have written on this &s;ubject, and therefore am oblig'd in Ju&s;tice to an&s;wer the Que&s;tions you propo&s;e, and at the &s;ame time to give the be&s;t &s;olution I can of &s;ome of your Doubts concerning tho&s;e rare Mo|numents.</P>
<P>All the <HI>Obelisks</HI> in <HI>Rome</HI> are quadrangular, and end in a &s;harp point. They re&s;embl'd the Rays of the <HI>Sun,</HI> that great <HI>Divinity</HI> ador'd by the <HI>Egyptians</HI> under the name of <HI>O&s;iris,</HI> and e&s;teem'd by 'em to be the Habitation of <HI>Beings, Genius's,</HI> and the <HI>Souls of the &V;niver&s;e.</HI> Their Angles re&s;pected the four Corners of the World, and denoted the four Elements.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="272">The <HI>Hieroglyphic</HI> Characters on the&s;e Obelisks have been &s;uppos'd by &s;ome to contain the Elogies of &s;ome <HI>Princes,</HI> or Hi&s;tories of certain memorable Tran&s;actions; and they believe that the&s;e Monuments were erected by the <HI>Egypti|ans,</HI> both to &s;erve for Ornaments, and to ho|nour the Heroes of their Nation: but tho&s;e who have penetrated furthe&s;t into the&s;e My&s;te|ries, have, in my opinion, demon&s;trated clearly, that the&s;e were open Books, which expos'd to the Eyes of the publick the Secrets of their <HI>Divinity, A&s;trology, Metaphy&s;ics, Magic,</HI> and all the other Sciences that were cultivated by the <HI>Egyptians.</HI> 'Tis certain, that the Vulgar was not capable of unriddling the My&s;teries of the&s;e <HI>Oracles;</HI> but then, as well as now, the unthink|ing part of Mankind amus'd them&s;elves with <HI>Shadows</HI> and <HI>Ob&s;curities.</HI></P>

M. <HI>Chevreau</HI> calls him a &s;illy Monk, and alledges three or four poor Rea&s;ons to prove his Simplicity. <HI>Since that Monk,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>in his Treati&s;e of the Wonders of</HI> Rome, <HI>mi&s;takes the Gate of</HI> O&s;tia, <HI>or of St.</HI> Paul, <HI>and of</HI> Capena, <HI>and St.</HI> Seba&s;tian, <HI>for another which he calls</HI> Collina, <HI>in&s;tead (as we may probably &s;uppo&s;e) of</HI> Collatina <HI>or</HI> Pinciana, <HI>the</HI> Pantheon <HI>for a Temple of</HI> Cybele, <HI>and the</HI> Am|phitheater <HI>for a Temple of the</HI> Sun, <HI>we may the more ea&s;ily forgive that Blunder in his Hi&s;tory, where he mi&s;takes a</HI> Pope <HI>for a</HI> Pope&s;s. In an&s;wer to the&s;e Reflexions, I &s;ay in the general, That tho' <HI>M. Polonus</HI> were really guilty of &s;ome Errors in giving an account of things of little impor|tance, or in explaining &s;ome hard and ob&s;cure Que&s;tions, we could not from thence infer, that he had given us a fal&s;e Relation of the <HI>Fe|male Pontiff. He took one</HI> Gate <HI>for another, and therefore he took a</HI> Pope <HI>for a</HI> Pope&s;s, is rather a
<PB N="99" REF="274">
<HI>Je&s;t</HI> than an <HI>Argument;</HI> or, if it mu&s;t pa&s;s for an Argument, it may be ea&s;ily retorted upon its Author; for, I may with equal rea&s;on affirm, that if Mr. <HI>Chevreau</HI>'s Reflexions on <HI>M. Polonus</HI> be fal&s;e and groundle&s;s, therefore all his Argu|ments again&s;t the Story that is the &s;ubject of our Controver&s;ie are meer Sophi&s;ms, and he mistakes a <HI>Pope&s;s</HI> for a <HI>Pope.</HI> That the Antece|dent is certainly true, will appear from the fol|lowing Con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>(1.) 'Tis plain, that Mr. <HI>Chevreau</HI> knew not that there was a <HI>Gate</HI> call'd <HI>Collina,</HI> when he wrote, That <HI>Polonus takes the Gate of</HI> O&s;tia, <HI>and the Gate</HI> Capena <HI>for another which he call'd</HI> Collina&punc; <HI>in&s;tead of</HI> Collatina <HI>or</HI> Pinciana. But 'tis certain that <HI>Collina</HI> was the name of a Gate as well as <HI>Collatina;</HI> it took its name <HI>&agrave; Colle Quirinali,</HI> and is mention'd by <HI>Ovid;</HI>
<Q><L>Templa frequentari <HI>Collinae</HI> proxima portae</L>
<L>Nunc decet; &mdash;</L>
<P>Fa&s;t. 4.</P></Q>
This Gate is now call'd <HI>Salara.</HI></P>
<P>(2.) The Gate <HI>Collatina,</HI> &s;o call'd from the Town of <HI>Collatium,</HI> is different from the <HI>Pinciana,</HI> as <HI>F. Nardin</HI> has clearly demon&s;trated.</P>
<P>(3.) Mr. <HI>Chevreau</HI> had no rea&s;on to find fault with <HI>Martinus Polonus,</HI> for calling the <HI>Pantheon</HI> a Temple of <HI>Cybele,</HI> &s;ince &s;everal learned Anti|quaries are of the &s;ame opinion. 'Tis true in|deed, and I think I have already told you, that Authors are not agreed in their Conjectures concerning the Denomination of the <HI>Pantheon:</HI>
<PB N="100" REF="275">
But there are many who believe that it was &s;o call'd becau&s;e it was con&s;ecrated by <HI>Agrippa</HI> to <HI>Jupiter</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Jupiter <HI>the</HI> Avenger.</NOTE>, and to<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">'Tis not alto|gether improba|ble that <HI>Cybele</HI> her &s;elf was a multiply'd Dei|ty: for &s;he was wor&s;hip'd under the &s;everal Names of <HI>Ops, Rhea, Ve&s;ta, Berecynthia, Dindymena, Tellus, Magna Pales,</HI> and <HI>Magna Mater.</HI> She was al&s;o call'd <HI>Natura rorum Parens.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Cybele</HI> the Mother of <HI>all the Gods.</HI> However, &s;ince Opinions are divided, and the Que&s;tion is at the be&s;t problematical, <HI>Polonus</HI> cannot without Inju&s;tice be accus'd of an Error, for what he has written on this &s;ub|ject.</P>
<P>(4) Mr. <HI>Chevreau</HI> is not ea&s;ily to be under|&s;tood, when he talks of the <HI>Roman Amphitheater,</HI> for there were &s;everal <HI>Amphitheaters</HI> in that City, and the Ruins of &s;ome of 'em are &s;till remaining. I &s;uppo&s;e he meant the great Amphitheater call'd <HI>Colli&s;eum,</HI> which was built by <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian,</HI> and dedicated by <HI>Titus.</HI></P>
<P>(5.) I confe&s;s I have not read <HI>Polonus</HI>'s Trea|ti&s;e concerning <HI>Rome,</HI> but 'tis very improbable that he took the <HI>Colli&s;eum</HI> for a Temple. This is certainly too great an Ab&s;urdity to be be|liev'd, and I vehemently &s;u&s;pect that &s;ome of his Expre&s;&s;ions are mi&s;under&s;tood. He might indeed &s;peak of a <HI>Temple of the Sun</HI> near that <HI>Amphitheater,</HI> but he could not po&s;&s;ibly imagin, that the <HI>Colli&s;eum</HI> was its &s;elf a <HI>Temple.</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t further tell you, that what you relate concerning a <HI>Manu&s;cript Polonus</HI> which you have &s;een, where this Story is written on the margin, and by another Hand, does not at all reach the bottom of our Controver&s;ie. You may ea&s;ily conceive that &s;ome intere&s;s'd Per&s;on having geld|ed our Author, that Defect was afterwards &s;up|ply'd
<PB N="101" REF="275">
by a more equitable Hand: And thus your <HI>Manu&s;cript</HI> is only a particular In&s;tance, from which nothing can be concluded again&s;t the Credit of other Copies. If &s;ome per&s;on &s;hould think fit to re&s;tore the Hi&s;tory of our <HI>Pope&s;s,</HI> by way of a marginal Note, in the mu|tilated Copies of <HI>Ana&s;ta&s;ius,</HI> this could not de|&s;troy the Authority of tho&s;e Originals where the &s;ame Relation is to be found in the Text. Thus we may rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e, that the Story of Pope <HI>Joan</HI> was left out in your Manu&s;cript, and afterwards re&s;tor'd by another Hand: And even <HI>Bellarmin</HI> confe&s;&s;es, that <HI>Martinus Polonus</HI> wrote the Hi&s;tory of our <HI>Pope&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>But to return to Mr. <HI>Chevreau.</HI> You may ob&s;erve how much he was puzzl'd to give &s;ome probable account of the fir&s;t occa&s;ion of that Controver&s;ie, &s;ince he is forc'd to have recour&s;e to the Opinion, or rather Eva&s;ion, of <HI>Onuphrius,</HI> tho' he conceals the Name of the Author. He pretends that Pope <HI>John</HI> the Twelfth had a Con|cubine call'd <HI>Joan,</HI> who was his Favourite, and govern'd him &s;o ab&s;olutely, that he was u&s;ually nick-nam'd <HI>Joan.</HI> Be&s;ides, he goes further than <HI>Onuphrius;</HI> for whereas that Author &s;peaks only conjecturally, Mr. <HI>Chevreau</HI> a&s;&s;erts po&s;itively, <HI>That</HI> John <HI>the Twelfth was call'd</HI> Pope Joan, <HI>becau&s;e of the blind Complai&s;ance that he had for his Concu|bine. Onuphrius</HI>'s Conjectures are meer airy No|tions and groundle&s;s Su&s;picions: and Mr. <HI>Chev|reau</HI>'s A&s;&s;ertion is ra&s;h and precarious; he can produce no other Argument to prove, that <HI>John</HI> the Twelfth was call'd <HI>Pope Joan,</HI> but his own bare Authority; and neither <HI>Onuphrius</HI> nor he
<PB N="102" REF="276">
can make it appear, that<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Platina</HI> calls him the mo&s;t pernicious and infamous of all the Popes that preceeded him. Some Writers relate, adds that Author, That he was &s;lain in the act of Adultery.</NOTE> ever <HI>Pope John</HI> had &s;uch a Concubine. 'Tis true, they both cite <HI>Luitprand</HI> to confirm their Hypothe&s;is, but they cite him fal&s;ly. The Name of the Widow men|tion'd by Mr. <HI>Chevreau</HI> was <HI>Ann,</HI> not <HI>Joan;</HI> and without doubt he was ignorant that our illu&s;tri|ous<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg"><HI>M</HI> du Ple&s;&s;is Mornay.</NOTE> <HI>Du Ple&s;&s;is</HI> had already di&s;cover'd the For|gery which <HI>Onuphrius</HI> made u&s;e of to &s;trengthen his Conjecture. Be&s;ides, it may be ob&s;erv'd, that this Pope <HI>John</HI> was advanc'd to the Papal Chair a hundred years after Pope <HI>Joan,</HI> which is another Ab&s;urdity that attends Mr. <HI>Chevreau</HI>'s Opinion.</P>
<P>He adds, That <HI>the Story of the pretended bor'd Chair is not better grounded, and that the Chair is not bor'd.</HI> But, by his leave, I have &s;een it more than once, and if I may believe my own Eyes, it is bor'd, and that after the u&s;ual manner of Clo&s;e &s;tools. I have already told you that it is of Porphyry; but there are two of 'em, one broken and the other entire, and they are both made of the &s;ame matter, and after the &s;ame fa&s;hion.</P>
<P><HI>Platina</HI> affirms po&s;itively, after<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Laonicus Chalcondylas</HI> an <HI>Athenian,</HI> who flouri&s;h'd about the middle of the Fifteenth Age.</NOTE> <HI>Chalcondylas</HI> and other approv'd Authors, That the new elected Pope is plac'd on the bor'd Chair, and that the younge&s;t Deacon thru&s;ts his Hand thro' the hole, to feel whether he has the &s;ure&s;t marks of Virility. Such, probably, was the primitive u&s;e of this Chair; for, what Rea&s;on could have prompted the&s;e Authors to invent &s;uch a Fable? 'Tis true, this Cu&s;tom was by degrees laid a&s;ide, but they continu'd for &s;ome time to &s;et the Popes on the &s;ame Chair, to put 'em in mind,

as Mr. <HI>Chevreau</HI> affirms after <HI>Fauchet,</HI> that they were &s;till &s;ubject to the common Infirmities of Humane Nature. However, I will not in&s;i&s;t longer upon this &s;ubject, &s;ince 'tis altogether foreign to our Controver&s;ie.</P>
<P>To proceed to Mr. <HI>Chevreau</HI>'s la&s;t Argument, he tells us, That <HI>the Fathers of the Council of</HI> Soi&s;&s;ons <HI>having written to Pope</HI> Leo <HI>the Fourth, to de&s;ire his Approbation, their Deputies found that he was deceas'd before their arrival, and return'd the &s;ame year from</HI> Rome <HI>to</HI> France, <HI>with the Sub&s;cri|ption of his Succe&s;&s;or</HI> Benedict <HI>III.</HI> You have &s;een with how little certainty this Author has pro|ceeded hitherto; and his End is &s;uitable to his Beginning, He mentions a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">It was the &s;e|cond Council or Conventicle held at that place, which <HI>Nicholas</HI> the First would never be per|&s;waded to ap|prove.</NOTE> Council of <HI>Soi&s;&s;ons,</HI> without any other Mark of Di&s;tinction: He tells us a Story without the lea&s;t proof, and, which is wor&s;e, he cannot prove it; for we mu&s;t not rely upon the Te&s;timonies of <HI>Sirmond</HI> and <HI>Binius,</HI> or on the Authority of the late Editions of the Councils. To prove his A&s;&s;er|tion, e&s;pecially in &s;uch a doubtful Ca&s;e as this, he ought to produce <HI>Manu&s;cripts</HI> of <HI>uncontroverted</HI> Antiquity and Credit; but we mu&s;t excu&s;e him, &s;ince his Story is not to be found in &s;uch au|thentick Originals. If he could certainly fix the time of the departure of that Council's Envoys to Pope <HI>Leo,</HI> and of their return after his death, the duration of his Pontificate might be al&s;o determin'd, which none of all tho&s;e who deny the Story of Pope <HI>Joan</HI> have hitherto been able to do. This is an important Remark, and de&s;erves to be con&s;ider'd with attention. <HI>Onu|phrius,</HI> and the re&s;t of his Party, are forc'd to lengthen the Lives of the Popes that preceeded
<PB N="104" REF="278">
and follow'd our Pope&s;s, and by confounding the order of their &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, have thrown them&s;elves into inextricable Labyrinths. <HI>Bellar|min,</HI> one of the mo&s;t &s;ubtle and dextrous of all the&s;e Chronologers, in his Treati&s;e of <HI>Eccle&s;ia|&s;tical Writers,</HI> extends the time of <HI>Nicholas</HI> the Fir&s;t's Pontificate to<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg"><HI>Platina</HI> com|putes Seven years, Nine months, and Thirteen days.</NOTE> Ten years, which in his <HI>Chronology</HI> he reduces to Nine years and a half. Examine all the&s;e Authors, and you &s;hall not find one who does not contradict him&s;elf, &s;o difficult a Task it is to counterfeit the Truth. <HI>Bellarmin</HI> has not forgot to calculate the time of the Pontificate of any one Pope, but only of <HI>Leo</HI> IV, which is a &s;hrewd &s;ign that he was &s;trangely puzzl'd how to di&s;po&s;e of the Two years during which the Papal Throne was fill'd by <HI>Joan, ali&agrave;s John</HI> VIII. But this is not the only Inconvenience with which his Opinion is clogg'd; for he and his Companions, by ex|punging that Woman out of the Catalogue of Popes, have entangl'd them&s;elves in new Diffi|culties. And whereas they who make Truth the Standard of their Relations reckon four and twenty Popes that bore the Name of <HI>John,</HI> the re&s;t count only twenty three, and by &s;o doing confound the whole Hi&s;tory. Thus their <HI>John the Twelfth,</HI> whom we mention'd before, is <HI>John the Thirteenth,</HI> according to <HI>Platina,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Or</HI> Bartholo|mew Caranza, <HI>call'd al&s;o</HI> Mi|randa, <HI>Archbi|&s;hop of</HI> Toledo, <HI>in his</HI> Abridg|ment of the Councils.</NOTE> <HI>Ga|renza,</HI> and all faithful and unbya&s;s'd Hi&s;to|rians.</P>
<P>I have nothing more to add concerning Mr. <HI>Chevreau,</HI> for I will not trouble you with an account of all the Faults that I have ob|&s;erv'd in his Hi&s;tory. And indeed, it is no great wonder that he was not able to carry on &s;o va&s;t

and general a Work without falling into &s;ome Errors.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only &s;ubjoin three or four &s;hort Re|marks for a further illu&s;tration of our pre&s;ent Controver&s;ie.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t not be &s;urpriz'd to find our <HI>Pope&s;s</HI> call'd both <HI>Anglicus</HI> and <HI>Moguntinus,</HI> as if that were a plain Contradiction; the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Werner Rool|winck <HI>a</HI> We&s;t|phalian.</NOTE> Author of <HI>Fa&s;ciculus Temporum</HI> has unriddl'd the whole My&s;tery in the&s;e words, <HI>Joannes Anglicus cognomine, &s;ed na|tione Moguntinus.</HI> Her Name was <HI>Joan Engli&s;h,</HI> and &s;he was born at <HI>Mentz.</HI></P>
<P>The Variations that are ob&s;erv'd in <HI>Manu|&s;cripts</HI> ought not to trouble you. I acknow|ledge, that this Story is to be found in &s;ome of 'em, and not in others; but you are not ignorant of the Forgeries of Tran&s;cribers, or how they were wont to mangle the Books with which they were intru&s;ted. I might ea&s;i|ly fill a large Volume with In&s;tances of their Impo&s;tures.</P>
<P>I &s;ee no rea&s;on why it &s;hould appear &s;trange that &s;ome of tho&s;e who relate this Hi&s;tory &s;eem to &s;peak doubtfully of it; for, be&s;ides that it &s;eems at fir&s;t view to be encumber'd with &s;ome odd and intricate circum&s;tances; 'tis certain that they could not expre&s;s much Zeal in de|fending the Truth of &s;uch a Relation, without expo&s;ing them&s;elves to vi&s;ible Dangers. The Force of Truth prompted and compell'd 'em to &s;peak; and the Fear of giving Offence to the Court of <HI>Rome</HI> was a Bridle to re&s;train 'em. All this may be ea&s;ily conceiv'd; however, we &s;ee &s;everal Authors have broken thro' all the&s;e Difficulties, and have given us &s;uch clear and
<PB N="106" REF="279">
exact accounts of that Event, that we could not have de&s;erv'd a more po&s;itive confirmation of it.</P>
<P>Two or three &s;uch Te&s;timonies as the&s;e would be &s;ufficient to convince any rea&s;onable Per&s;on of the truth of our A&s;&s;ertion. And, what tho' they are contradicted by Hundreds, and by Millions? Truth can never be over|power'd by the numbers of its Enemies&punc; The Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Pope&s;s</HI> does not imply the lea&s;t contradiction; it is atte&s;ted by &s;everal Men of Honour, who were con&s;train'd by the Evidence of Truth to &s;peak again&s;t the Intere&s;t of their own Party; our Adver&s;aries them&s;elves cannot pretend that it was foi&s;ted into the Writings of the&s;e Authors by the Enemies of Popery; and it was receiv'd without contradiction during the &s;pace of Five hundred years, by the confe&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e very per&s;ons who call it a Fable. 'Tis plain then, that all the <HI>Negative Authorities</HI> in the World are not capable of <HI>invalidating</HI> the Credit of &s;o many <HI>Authentick Witne&s;&s;es,</HI> and of a Relation &s;o &s;olidly and generally atte&s;ted.</P>
<P>I have already given you an account of my Thoughts, in an&s;wer to that part of your Letter where you mention &s;ome of our Doctors, who deny the Story of <HI>Pope Joan;</HI> but &s;ince I perceive you in&s;i&s;t on this Argument, I mu&s;t tell you plainly, that it is a very unwarrantable piece of Partiality, not to give it a wor&s;e name, blindly to embrace the Opinions of any Man not divinely in&s;pir'd, whatever figure he may make in the World. A Man of Sence will never &s;uffer his Judgment to be bya&s;s'd either by the Voice of the Publick, or by the Numbers

Three quarters of the Chri&s;tian World are meer Slaves to tho&s;e ancient Writers whom they call <HI>The Fathers;</HI> tho', 'tis certain, the good In&s;tructions they have left us are mix'd with a great number of dangerous, fal&s;e, in&s;ipid, and ridiculous Opi|nions.</P>
<P>I thought to have ended our Controver&s;ie here, but I believe it will not be improper to remove another Difficulty before I leave this Subject. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I was &s;omewhat &s;ur|priz'd to find that, in&s;tead of Mr. <HI>Chevreau,</HI> you had conjur'd up again&s;t me &s;o terrible an Adver&s;ary as the famous<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">David Blon|del.</NOTE> <HI>Blondel,</HI> who is the Pillar and Bulwark of <HI>Antipope&s;&s;i&s;m,</HI> and who&s;e bare Name has gain'd abundance of Pro&s;elytes to his Opinions.

The Name of the Author is the &s;tronge&s;t Argument in his Book, and it is that alone which has given the greate&s;t Blow to his Enemies.</P>
<P>I have read this Piece over and over with at|tention, and can a&s;&s;ure you it is written after a manner very proper to blind the Eyes and con|found the Judgments of the generality of Rea|ders. But tho&s;e who will not &s;uffer them&s;elves to be impos'd upon, and &s;till look for &s;omething that is &s;olid and material, will not find any

<P>I could fill a Volume with Ob&s;ervations and Critici&s;ms on this Work, for I have made &s;ome Reflexions on every Page, and perhaps every Period in it. This is not a proper place for 'em; but I may find an opportunity hereafter to communicate 'em to you; in the mean time I &s;hall content my &s;elf with giving you a general Idea of it, accompanied with a few particular Remarks, according to the method by which I have anatomiz'd it.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Blondel</HI> begins with a Declaration that gives a wound to his Cau&s;e, which all his Arti|fices can never palliate. The Force of Truth and of authentick Te&s;timonies, which he re|ceiv'd from<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">He means <HI>Salma&s;ius.</HI></NOTE> tho&s;e to whom he neither would nor dur&s;t refu&s;e to give credit, extorted this in|genuous Confe&s;&s;ion from him, That <HI>the Hi&s;tory of the Female Pope is contain'd in the</HI> Augsburg <HI>Copies of</HI> Ana&s;ta&s;ius; which I mention'd before. You &s;ee what Advantage he has given to his Enemies; and, what Stratagem d' ye think he u&s;es to recover his Ground? Could you ima|gine that a man of his parts would have recour&s;e to the poore&s;t Eva&s;ion that ever baffl'd Au|thor was guilty of? or, that he would &s;tart an imaginary Difficulty, that he might afterwards the more ea&s;ily grapple with this Wind-mill in his own Brain? He is &s;en&s;ible there is no|thing but dry Blows to be got by meddling with the&s;e original Manu&s;cripts, and that they would be too hard for all his Rhetoric, and therefore he e'en very fairly leaves 'em as he found 'em, without ever mentioning 'em after|wards,
<PB N="109" REF="281">
and finds out another <HI>Ana&s;ta&s;ius</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> written about Two hundred years ago, which contains al&s;o the &s;ame Hi&s;tory, but accompa|nied with &s;ome circum&s;tances which, he a&s;&s;ures us, imply &s;everal Contradictions. And, <HI>It &s;eems,</HI> adds he, <HI>that the</HI> Pari&s;ian Ana&s;ta&s;ius <HI>&s;hould give light to tho&s;e of</HI> Augsburg. At fir&s;t he dares not advance &s;uch a Paradox, but with an <HI>it &s;eems,</HI> and without con&s;idering whether that which <HI>&s;eems</HI> to him does al&s;o <HI>&s;eem</HI> &s;o to others; he builds his Di&s;cour&s;e on this uncertain Foundation, and at the &s;ame time, tho' tacitely, e&s;tabli&s;hes his Suppo&s;ition for a certain Truth. Thus, with his <HI>Ana&s;ta&s;ius</HI> of Two hundred years, he has found the Secret to confute all the other Copies of that Author, without citing one of 'em.</P>
<P>But, what is &s;till wor&s;e, his <HI>Ana&s;ta&s;ius</HI> is a private Piece, which he &s;hews only by Shreds, and dares not produce. If I were not re&s;train'd by fear of injuring Mr. <HI>Blondel</HI>'s Sincerity, I &s;hould be &s;trongly tempted to &s;u&s;pect that his <HI>Manu&s;cript</HI> was never &s;een by any Man but him|&s;elf: and at lea&s;t I think I may be allow'd to &s;up|po&s;e that he dur&s;t not quote the whole pa&s;&s;age, le&s;t it might furni&s;h his Adver&s;aries with Wea|pons again&s;t him&s;elf.</P>

<P>Secondly, After we have blindly believ'd all that this Author is pleas'd to tell us concerning his pretended <HI>Ana&s;ta&s;ius,</HI> we mu&s;t extend our Com|plai&s;ance further, and, upon the credit of his bare <HI>it &s;eems,</HI> either believe or &s;uppo&s;e his tacite Infe|rence, that this <HI>Manu&s;cript</HI> not only may &s;erve to illu&s;trate the <HI>Ana&s;ta&s;ius's</HI> of <HI>Augsburg,</HI> as he pretends at fir&s;t, but is a true Copy of the&s;e, and even of the mo&s;t ancient and exact <HI>Ana&s;ta|&s;ius's;</HI> for, if this &s;uppo&s;ition be fal&s;e, all his Arguments mu&s;t fall to the Ground.</P>
<P>I may venture to affirm, that this Con&s;ide|ration alone is &s;ufficient to di&s;credit Mr. <HI>Blon|del</HI>'s famous Book, the main de&s;ign of which &s;hould have been to de&s;troy and confute, by clear and &s;olid Rea&s;ons, the po&s;itive Te&s;timony of &s;uch a learn'd and unintere&s;s'd <HI>Eye-witne&s;s</HI> as <HI>Ana&s;ta&s;ius.</HI></P>
<P>Before I proceed to communicate to you &s;ome other Remarks on Mr. <HI>Blondel</HI>'s Treati&s;e, I mu&s;t de&s;ire you not to expect to find 'em all accompanied with Demon&s;trations; I may per|haps, for brevity's &s;ake, omit the Proofs of &s;ome of my A&s;&s;ertions, but I &s;hall be ready to &s;upply that Defect when you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>In the general 'tis certain, that <HI>this Book may be entirely and unan&s;werably confuted out of it &s;elf;</HI> and that <HI>far from de&s;troying the Hi&s;tory of the Pope&s;s, the Truth of that Event may be &s;olidly demon&s;trated by Rea&s;ons drawn from this very Treati&s;e.</HI> The&s;e are two Po&s;itions which I dare confidently a&s;&s;ert, and undertake to maintain.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="282">Among all the Contradictions with which this Di&s;cour&s;e is &s;tuff'd, I &s;hall only de&s;ire you to ob&s;erve, that two thirds of it are &s;pent in litigious <HI>Chronological</HI> Cavils, and vain Rhodo|montadoes again&s;t the Authors of our Hi&s;tory. After which he forgets him&s;elf &s;o far,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Above all, the Chronology of the Bi&s;hops or Popes of <HI>Rome</HI> is a dreadful Labyrinth.</NOTE> as to make a long Harangue to demon&s;trate the un|certainty of <HI>Chronology,</HI> and the weakne&s;s of tho&s;e Arguments that are drawn from it, either to confirm or invalidate the Truth of a Relation. When he finds that <HI>Chronology</HI> may be accom|modated to his Hypothe&s;is, he flies at it greedi|ly, and triumphs as in the Te&s;timony of an Oracle; but every thing that looks a skew up|on his Calculation, is a Trifle or Mi&s;take.</P>
<P>There is a certain Air of O&s;tentation &s;pread over all his Book, which makes him on all occa&s;ions leave the &s;ubject of his Di&s;cour&s;e, that he may at any rate make a vain Show of his Reading. And even, not unfrequently, this itching De&s;ire to &s;how his Learning makes him utter things extreamly di&s;advantageous to the Intere&s;t of his Opinion; but he mu&s;t di&s;play all that he knows, what&s;oever it may co&s;t him.</P>
<P>He heaps up a multitude of needle&s;s and impertinent Quotations, not only to &s;atisfie his Vanity, but al&s;o to confound his Readers, and to &s;tun 'em with a multitude of noi&s;ie Au|thorities? 'Tis plain, that he endeavours to weary People, and to bar the acce&s;s to his Book with heaps of u&s;ele&s;s Digre&s;&s;ions and empty Cavils, which &s;erve only to encrea&s;e the Ob&s;curity and Intricacy of the controverted Que&s;tion. He very &s;eldom pur&s;ues his De|&s;ign
<PB N="112" REF="283">
clo&s;ely, and oftentimes picks up &s;ome tri|vial Story which Chance throws in his way, and makes as great a noi&s;e with it, as if it were tne main Point for which he contends. He triumphs out of &s;ea&s;on, and confutes petty Circum&s;tances with a great deal of Solemnity, to amu&s;e his Readers. He exaggerates Diffi|culties, and when he meets with one that plea|&s;es him, &s;plits it perhaps into half a &s;core. He fills his Refutations with &s;currilous and injuri|ous Reflexions. He commonly gives the Lye to his Adver&s;aries, and upbraids 'em with Im|po&s;tures and Blunders, that he may in&s;en&s;ibly accu&s;tom tho&s;e that will &s;uffer them&s;elves to be influenc'd by &s;o bad an Example, to rail per|petually again&s;t the A&s;&s;erters of the oppo&s;ite Opinion. His Je&s;ts are al&s;o too &s;piteful and biting, and he lays about him on all hands without Mercy. This Peevi&s;hne&s;s and ill Humour is an evident &s;ign that he was non-plu&s;s'd; and &s;ometimes he vi&s;ibly bewrays a great deal of Fear and He&s;itancy in the ma|nagement of his Attacks: Neither is he very &s;ollicitous to be under&s;tood, if he can but hoodwink his Readers, and draw 'em after him into the Labyrinth in which he has engag'd him&s;elf.</P>
<P>'Tis certainly very plea&s;ant to ob&s;erve how the&s;e doughty Critics, after they have exhau&s;t|ed their Wit in Reflexions on the Hi&s;tory of our <HI>Pope&s;s,</HI> are puzzl'd to divine the original occa&s;ion of that pretended Fable.

the probability of <HI>Pope Joan</HI>'s Adventure. O|thers, as <HI>Onuphrius</HI> and Mr. <HI>Chevreau,</HI> transform an <HI>Ann</HI> to a <HI>Joan,</HI> as I intimated before, and by a &s;econd <HI>Metamorpho&s;is</HI> turn this <HI>Joan</HI> into a <HI>Maud,</HI> or an <HI>Olympia,</HI> who govern'd Pope <HI>John</HI> the Twelfth; and at la&s;t they &s;queeze a &s;ort of a Pope&s;s out of this Concubine, whom, after all, they are forc'd to bury a hundred years before &s;he was born, that they may bring her again upon the Stage in time and place conve|nient. <HI>Allatius</HI> has al&s;o forg'd a certain <HI>Thiota,</HI> a pretended Prophete&s;s of <HI>Mentz,</HI> whom he transfigures as dexterou&s;ly as he can into a <HI>Fe|male Pontife.</HI> Mr. <HI>Blondel</HI> relates &s;everal other Conjectures, and confutes 'em all; he is won|derfully mode&s;t on this occa&s;ion, and acknow|ledges that this is a My&s;tery which he is not able to unriddle. But this is not the only place where he di&s;plays his Candour; for he imploys fourteen or fifteen Pages of his Pamphlet in a Panegyric on Truth and Ju&s;tice; and while the Fit of Genero&s;ity is upon him, he cannot &s;uffer tho&s;e unju&s;t Calumniators of the Papal See to e&s;cape unpuni&s;h'd; which, he a&s;&s;ures us, was the only Motive that oblig'd him to draw his Pen.

<P>Whether there ever was a <HI>Woman-Pope,</HI> or not, 'tis certain things are otherwi&s;e in &s;uch a po&s;ture, that this Circum&s;tance &s;ingly con&s;i|der'd can neither be advantageous nor prejudi|cial to the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Church of Rome.</HI> I never could endure to in&s;ult over 'em upon this account, as &s;ome among us are wont to do,
<PB N="114" REF="284">
for I'm per&s;waded that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to draw any Inferences from this Adventure more to the di&s;advantage of that Party, than tho&s;e that may ea&s;ily be deduc'd from the Stories of &s;everal <HI>Popes</HI> who were far wor&s;e than our <HI>Pope&s;s.</HI> If, excepting only this Creature, all the re&s;t of the Popes had been Men of Probity, good Chri|&s;tians, and vigilant and faithful Pa&s;tors; had their Lives and Morals been unblemi&s;h'd, and their Doctrine pure and uncorrupted, I &s;hould not be &s;urpriz'd that tho&s;e of that Profe&s;&s;ion could not bear &s;o &s;candalous a Reproach. But &s;ince the mo&s;t bigotted Authors of the <HI>Roman</HI> Communion acknowledge that there has been a prodigious number of abominable Popes, why &s;hould our <HI>She-Pontife</HI> be e&s;teem'd a more hide|ous Mon&s;ter than the re&s;t, meerly becau&s;e &s;he was of another Sex? The <HI>Church of Rome</HI> then ought not to make &s;uch a terrible pother about an affair of &s;o little con&s;equence: and certain|ly Mr. <HI>Blondel</HI> had much le&s;s rea&s;on to take Pep|per in the No&s;e on the &s;ame occa&s;ion: his Zeal is at be&s;t but impertinent, and his Charity un|profitable. Such an in&s;ignificant <HI>Remedy</HI> as that which he admini&s;ters can never <HI>purifie</HI> the whole <HI>Ma&s;s</HI> of the <HI>Papal Blood,</HI> which, by the unani|mous confe&s;&s;ion of Hi&s;torians of all Religions, is extreamly <HI>foul</HI> and <HI>corrupted.</HI> And it mu&s;t be acknowledg'd, that Mr. <HI>Blondel</HI>'s Harangue on tho&s;e Principles of Genero&s;ity that prompted him to undertake this Work, is too tedious and full of Affectation, to per&s;wade a judicious and unbya&s;s'd Reader of the Author's Sincerity.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="284">But I mu&s;t at la&s;t conclude this Subject, by telling you all I think, and even all that I know of my Adver&s;ary.

A Man of Honour who liv'd at <HI>Paris,</HI> and knew that Writer particularly, inform'd me, that he learn'd from the fir&s;t hand that he was <HI>hir'd</HI> to write a Treati&s;e again&s;t the Story of <HI>Pope Joan.</HI> My Author is in all re&s;pects worthy of Credit; nor is Mr. <HI>Blondel</HI> the only Man in the World who has been per&s;waded by <HI>Silver Ar|guments</HI> to act &s;uch a part.</P>
<P>'Tis not without Reluctancy I mention any thing that may be made u&s;e of to blacken the Character of a Man, who, to take him in the general, was certainly a Per&s;on of Merit; and you mu&s;t give me leave to &s;ay in his ju&s;tificati|on, that perhaps he really believ'd the Story to be doubtful: Be&s;ides that, all things con&s;ider'd, he did a Favour to the <HI>Church of Rome,</HI> by writing again&s;t the <HI>Pope&s;s,</HI> without doing the lea&s;t Injury to <HI>Ours.</HI> Our Religious Differences do not at all depend on the Truth or Fal&s;hood of that Story; and therefore Mr. <HI>Blondel</HI> might look upon it as a matter of Indifference.</P>

<P>The <HI>Jews</HI> at <HI>Rome</HI> enjoy'd &s;ome mea&s;ure of Liberty, and liv'd &s;omewhat ea&s;ily before the Pontificate of <HI>Paul</HI> the Fourth; but that Pope was a terrible Enemy to 'em: For whereas be|fore they were permitted to live in any part of the City, he confin'd 'em to one corner of it, whither he order'd 'em to retire at the clo&s;e of the Evening. He forc'd 'em to &s;ell their Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions, and &s;uffer'd 'em only to trade in old Clothes. He commanded 'em, for a mark of di&s;tinction, to wear yellow Hats, and i&s;&s;u'd out an expre&s;s prohibition, That no Chri&s;tians &s;hould either eat or conver&s;e with 'em. <HI>I</HI> am inform'd, that by a Decree of <HI>Gregory</HI> XIII, they were oblig'd, or at lea&s;t a certain number of 'em, to hear a Chri&s;tian Sermon every <HI>Saturday</HI> in the Afternoon, but I have not yet had an opportunity to &s;ee that A&s;&s;embly.

believe, <HI>Con&s;tantine the Great</HI> was baptiz'd. We &s;aw &s;ix <HI>Turks</HI> baptiz'd in this Church; they wore a Cloak of white Damask, and a Lawn|band, with a Silver Cro&s;s hanging at their Neck. The Cardinal that was to officiate be|ing come with the Canons of that Church, the Ceremony was begun with ble&s;&s;ing the Wa|ter; after which the Pro&s;elytes, pre&s;ented by their Godfathers, advanc'd, every one in his turn, and declar'd their de&s;ire to be baptiz'd; then they lean'd over the Font, and the Cardinal baptiz'd 'em, and gave 'em their Names, by pouring Water on their Heads out of a large Silver Spoon; afterwards taking Wax Tapers in their Hands, they were confirm'd in the Cha|pel of the Bapti&s;tery, and from thence went to hear Ma&s;s in the &s;ame Church.</P>
<P>We were pre&s;ent al&s;o, the <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> before, at the Ceremony of <HI>wa&s;hing the Feet of Thirteen Pilgrims,</HI> in one of the Chapels of the <HI>Vatican;</HI> they were likewi&s;e cloth'd in white, and be&s;ides had a kind of Hood, with a &s;quare Cap.

<P>I will not trouble you with a particular Ac|count of the re&s;t of the Ceremonies that we &s;aw during the <HI>Holy Week,</HI> &s;ince they have been exactly de&s;crib'd by others.</P>
<P>The<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Innocent <HI>XI.</HI></NOTE> Pope is really old and infirm; but, 'tis plain, that he makes his want of Health &s;erve for a Pretext to excu&s;e his ab&s;ence at all tho&s;e numerous Ceremonies.

The Mini&s;ter that was entru&s;ted with the manage|ment of that Affair could never obtain a po&s;i|tive An&s;wer to his Propo&s;als, nor &s;o much as a free Audience.</P>
<P>The extream Privacy of that Retirement in which this Pontife &s;pends his days, not only hides him from the Eyes of Strangers, but they are even hardly able to perceive that he is in Town; for they never meet with any Lac|queys, Coaches, or Retinue that belong to him: when he goes abroad, which he does very rarely, he is carry'd in a Litter. The&s;e Litters are very large, lin'd with crim&s;on Velvet with|out and within, with Gold Galoons and Fringes; and the Harne&s;s of the Mules are adorn'd after the &s;ame manner. The Pope is always alone in his Litter, in the fore-part of which there is a little Table in&s;tead of a Seat. All Popes have the &s;ame Livery, which is &s;carlet, with a double Velvet-Galoon of the &s;ame colour. Almo&s;t all

<P>The two other Hor&s;es of Marble, that are to be &s;een in the Court of the <HI>Capitol,</HI> were taken from <HI>Pompey</HI>'s <HI>Theatre;</HI> and the Statue on Hor&s;e|back of Bra&s;s which &s;tands in the &s;ame place, was erected there by <HI>Paul</HI> III.

The common Opinion is, That this <HI>Column</HI> is in the <HI>Center</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> and that from hence they began to compute the di&s;tances from that City, which were divided into <HI>Miles</HI> by other Pillars that were erected on all the great Roads in <HI>Italy;</HI> but there are two or three Dif|ficulties that de&s;troy the probability of this &s;uppo&s;ition. The Column in the <HI>Forum Romanum</HI> mention'd by <HI>Suetonius, Tacitus,</HI> and &s;ome other ancient Authors, was, according to their Re|pre&s;entation of it, of Bra&s;s, or Bra&s;s gilt, and the Names of the great Roads were engrav'd upon it, with the computed di&s;tances of the principal Cities; but no &s;uch thing appears on the <HI>Milliarium</HI> in the <HI>Capitol.</HI> You will perhaps tell me, that the brazen Column might be lo&s;t, and the <HI>Milliarium</HI> &s;et up in its place; but you do not con&s;ider that this la&s;t was found adjoin|ing to the <HI>Appian</HI> Road, as it appears by the<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">Columnam <HI>Milliariam</HI> pri|mi ab urbe La|pidis Indicem, ab Imperatore <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;iano</HI> &amp; <HI>Nerva</HI> re&s;titu|tam, de Ruinis &s;uburbanis <HI>Viae Appiae</HI> in <HI>Capito|lium</HI> tran&s;tulit.</NOTE> mo|dern In&s;cription engrav'd on one of the Faces of its Pede&s;tal: nor is it at all probable that this Pillar was tran&s;ported from the middle of the City to a mile's di&s;tance from the Walls.

of 'em remaining.

<P>The <HI>Roman Catacombs</HI> &s;pread them&s;elves un|der all the <HI>Suburbs,</HI> but at <HI>Naples</HI> they are found only under one part of the City. The&s;e Caves are dug out of the Rocks, and extend very far on every &s;ide; each Vault is commonly about fifteen or eighteen foot wide, and the heighth of the Arch amounts to twelve or fifteen feet: on each &s;ide there are hollow Niches in the Walls, fram'd like Che&s;ts of all &s;izes, plac'd in rows above one another, without any regular Symmetry, where the Bodies were laid without Coffins, and cover'd with flat Stones or large Tyles, cemented with Chalk and Sand, as it appears di&s;tinctly in &s;ome places to this very day. Be&s;ides the Niches in the Catacombs of <HI>Naples,</HI> there are &s;ome Tombs of a rea&s;onable bigne&s;s, adorn'd with diver&s;e Pictures, among which there are many Figures of Heads and half-Bodies, with the Names of the Per&s;ons, <HI>Paulus, Nicolaus, Proculus, &amp;c.</HI> and &s;ometimes a

<P>Of all the <HI>Catacombs</HI> we view'd at <HI>Rome,</HI> tho&s;e of St. <HI>Seba&s;tian</HI> are the greare&s;t; the Ar|ches are commonly as high as tho&s;e of <HI>Naples,</HI> but the Vaults are but about two foot and a half broad. In &s;everal places we &s;aw a great number of cover'd Niches in the higher rows. A Prie&s;t, whom we happen'd one day to meet there, had the Curio&s;ity to open one of 'em, in which we found a <HI>Skeleton</HI> almo&s;t moulder'd away into whiti&s;h A&s;hes, yet we might perceive
<PB N="130" REF="292">
that the Body had been laid on its Back. The rea&s;on why the&s;e <HI>Catacombs</HI> were not made wider, is becau&s;e the Ground is &s;andy, and could not be underpropp'd, whereas tho&s;e of <HI>Naples</HI> are hewn out of the &s;olid Rock.</P>
<P>They pretend here, that <HI>the&s;e Vaults were dug by the Chri&s;tians; that during the Fir&s;t Ages of Chri&s;tianity, Divine Service was perform'd in 'em; that the&s;e burying-places were peculiar to the Chri&s;ti|ans, and never us'd by the Heathens; that a great number of Saints and Martyrs were interr'd in 'em; and con&s;equently,</HI> which is the Cream of the Story, <HI>that they are inexhau&s;tible Store-hou&s;es of Re|licks.</HI></P>
<P>Tho' the&s;e Suppo&s;itions were true, they could not ju&s;tifie the Practice of tho&s;e who pick up every Bone they meet with in a <HI>Catacomb,</HI> and meerly becau&s;e they found it there, conclude that it ought to be rank'd among tho&s;e things call'd <HI>Relicks.</HI> But this Con&s;ideration would lead me into a Controver&s;ie which I am not willing to examine at this time; neither will I undertake to write a long Di&s;&s;ertation con|cerning the fir&s;t part of the above-mention'd Hypothe&s;is, which would require more time and Books than I am Ma&s;ter of at pre&s;ent; on|ly in obedienee to your de&s;ire, I &s;hall make a few &s;hort Remarks on the&s;e Propo&s;itions.</P>
<P>Since we are not oblig'd to give credit to the &s;ingle Te&s;timony of any man in his own Cau&s;e, <HI>'Tis a general Rule that admits of no Excepti|ons,</HI> that every Man that expects to be believ'd mu&s;t prove what he affirms.

<PB N="131" REF="292">
u&s;e,</HI> ought to demon&s;trate the Truth of their A&s;&s;ertion.

famous an Antiquary than Mr. <HI>Spon;</HI> for you may ob&s;erve in the Collection of ancient In&s;cri|ptions with which he has enrich'd the account of his <HI>Voyage to Greece,</HI> that he could not be per&s;waded to believe that the <HI>Epitaph</HI> on a Tomb at <HI>Thebes,</HI> which they a&s;&s;ur'd him was St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s Sepulchre, was made by a <HI>Christian,</HI> meerly be|cau&s;e of the word MOIPHC, which he found in it, tho' it al&s;o mention'd the Immortality of the Soul. The &s;ame Author &s;peaks more po&s;itively to this purpo&s;e, when he refutes the common Opinion concerning the pretended Tomb of a Saint near <HI>Valentia.</HI> He &s;ays expre&s;ly, that the words <HI>Aethera</HI> and <HI>Superis</HI> mention'd in the In|&s;cription are, in his opinion, &s;ufficient Argu|ments to prove that it is the Tomb of a Heathen, and &s;ubjoins this Maxim, That the Stile of <HI>Epitaphs</HI> ought to be di&s;tingui&s;h'd from that of <HI>Poe&s;ie,</HI> by rea&s;on of the liberty claim'd by Poets of all Religions; whereas he a&s;&s;ures us that he has always di&s;cover'd evident marks of the Pie|ty and Simplicity of the Primitive Church in the In&s;criptions on ancient Tombs.

<P N="3">(3.)

<PB N="133" REF="293">
&s;uch as the Heathens were wont to put both in|to their Urns and Tombs. You know that they were not only de&s;irous to be lamented, which made 'em hire Women to weep at their Fu|nerals, but al&s;o took care to gather the&s;e <HI>Tears,</HI> and to pre&s;erve 'em with their A&s;hes or Bones.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, this Rea&s;on alone could not have convinc'd me, &s;ince 'tis certain, as I intimated before, that the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> borrow'd &s;everal le&s;s innocent Cu&s;toms from the Heathens. But this Ob&s;ervation may &s;erve to illu&s;trate and confirm the fir&s;t.</P>
<P N="4">(4.)

<P N="5">(5.)

<P>And as for the Nick-name of <HI>Arenarii,</HI> it may be ob&s;erv'd, that this Deri&s;ion of the Mi|&s;ery and Poverty of the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> does not prove that they were the only Per&s;ons in <HI>Rome</HI> who were reduc'd to trade in <HI>Sand,</HI> which is the thing that ought to have been demon&s;tra|ted, to remove the Difficulty which may ari&s;e from our &s;uppo&s;ing that other per&s;ons be&s;ides the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> were employ'd in digging the&s;e Holes. Tho' the <HI>Jews</HI> of <HI>Frankfort,</HI> for exam|ple, are oblig'd to run to any part of the City where a Fire happens to break forth, and to carry Water to quench it; it does not fol|low, that the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Inhabitants of that City remain idle Spectators of their Labours.</P>

The <HI>Cyphers of the Name of Chri&s;t, Palm branches, Doves of Peace, Cro&s;&s;es, Crowns,</HI> and other marks of <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> that are found on the Stones which cover the&s;e Sepulchres, in&s;tead of proving what our Adver&s;aries pretend, That the&s;e Burying places were peculiar to the <HI>Chri|&s;tians,</HI> &s;eem rather to evince, that they made u&s;e of &s;uch <HI>Symbols</HI> for Marks of di&s;tinction, to prevent their being confounded with the <HI>In|fidels.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis the common Opinion here, That the&s;e Cyphers repre&s;ented in the Margin are com|pos'd of a Latin P, for <HI>Pro</HI> or <HI>For,</HI> and a Cro&s;s, which &s;ignifies <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> &s;o that the&s;e Cha|racters
<PB N="135" REF="294">
are call'd <HI>Pro Chri&s;to's.</HI> They conclude from hence, that &s;uch Figures are the &s;ure Marks of the Tomb of a Martyr, or of one that &s;uffer'd <HI>Pro Chri&s;to,</HI> for the Name of Chri&s;t, and accordingly rai&s;e the price of the Relicks. But 'tis plain, that the&s;e Cyphers con&s;i&s;t of a X, <HI>Chi,</HI> and a P. <HI>Rho,</HI> which are the two fir&s;t Letters of &KHgr;&Rgr;&Igr;&Sgr;&Tgr;&Ogr;&Sgr;; as &Mgr;&Agr; and &THgr;&Ugr; &s;ignifie &Mgr;&Agr;&Rgr;&Igr;&Agr; &THgr;&Ugr;&Ggr;&Agr;&Tgr;&EEgr;&Rgr;, as I ob&s;erv'd in the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> Work on the Front of St. <HI>Mary major,</HI> and in &s;everal other places.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chri&s;tian Epitaphs</HI> that are found here &s;erve as little to confirm the adver&s;e Opinion as the above mention'd <HI>Symbols;</HI> for the Que&s;tion is not, whether the Bodies of &s;ome Chri&s;tians were buried in the <HI>Catacombs,</HI> which is a certain and undoubted Truth. Not only <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> and <HI>Miltiades</HI> Bi&s;hops of <HI>Rome</HI> under the Empire of <HI>Con&s;tantine,</HI> but <HI>Cains</HI> and <HI>Marcellus</HI> their Prede|ce&s;&s;ors, who &s;uffer'd Martyrdom with &s;ome other Chri&s;tians, by the expre&s;s Order of <HI>Diocle&s;ian,</HI> were all interr'd in the&s;e Vaults, if we may believe <HI>Platina.</HI> Be&s;ides, it appears by the dates of a great number of Epitaphs, that &s;everal Chri&s;tians were buried here during the Fir&s;t Ages: And I have &s;ufficient ground to believe they appropriated the&s;e Sepulchres entirely to them&s;elves in the &s;ucceeding times of Peace and Liberty.</P>
<P>Thus we may ea&s;ily comprehend how tho&s;e <HI>Chri&s;tian Epitaphs</HI> are to be found in the&s;e Cells, but after all the Controver&s;ie remains untouch'd; for the burying of Chri&s;tians here, is not a Rea|&s;on to exclude others from being interr'd in tho&s;e

<P>The Pictures of diver&s;e &s;orts and ages in the <HI>Catacombs</HI> at <HI>Naples,</HI> the Fa&s;hions of the <HI>Altars</HI> both there and at <HI>Rome,</HI> and &s;everal other Cir|cum&s;tances from which &s;ome pretend to draw Inferences, give no light to the Controver&s;ie, and de&s;erve not to be con&s;ider'd. The rea&s;on of which is, becau&s;e the Popes of the&s;e la&s;t Ages having always look'd upon their <HI>Catacombs</HI> as a profitable Source and Magazine of Relicks, have repair'd 'em in &s;everal places, and made &s;uch alterations as they thought mo&s;t proper to &s;trengthen the Opinion of the People, and e&s;pecially of the Pilgrims, who come from all parts to vi&s;it the&s;e Holy Places. <HI>Panciroli</HI> makes a long de&s;cription of the&s;e Reparations, by the help of which we may ea&s;ily re&s;olve the Diffi|culties that might ari&s;e from &s;everal things that are ob&s;erv'd in the&s;e <HI>Catacombs.</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t not forget to tell you, that during the time of the <HI>Plague</HI> which rag'd at <HI>Naples,</HI> about forty years ago, the <HI>Catacombs</HI> were the mo&s;t u&s;ual places of burial; and all the Bodies that are to be &s;een there at pre&s;ent, are &s;uch as were interr'd on that occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Near the Church and Catacombs of St. <HI>Agnes</HI> there is an old round Temple, which &s;ome think was a Temple of <HI>Bacchus.</HI> This Conceit is grounded only on certain ancient Repre&s;enta|tions of Vines and Vintages which are on the Roof, and on the Figures of Grapes, Vine|branches, little <HI>Cupids</HI> gathering and pre&s;&s;ing the Grapes, Ve&s;&s;els, Tuns, Panniers, and &s;uch
<PB N="137" REF="295">
other Appurtenances of <HI>Bacchus</HI> that are to be &s;een on a Tomb of Porphyry in the &s;ame Temple. But all the&s;e Circum&s;tances are not &s;ufficient to prove, that this Temple was con|&s;ecrated to him, or that the above-mention'd Tomb is his Sepulchre, e&s;pecially if we call to mind that <HI>Bacchus</HI> dy'd not at <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>Since this Temple is but a hundred or &s;ix&s;core paces di&s;tant from St. <HI>Agnes</HI> Church, which was undoubtedly built by <HI>Constantine,</HI> it may with much greater probability be conjectur'd, that the former was built at the &s;ame time to &s;erve for a <HI>Bapti&s;tery</HI> to the latter, according to the general Cu&s;tom of tho&s;e times; and there is al&s;o another like Building, which was erected by the &s;ame Emperor for a <HI>Bapti&s;tery</HI> to S. <HI>John de Lateran.</HI> Neither the Ornaments of the Roof, nor tho&s;e of the Tomb, are incon&s;i&s;tent with this Opinion, &s;ince they are al&s;o <HI>Symbols</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;tianity.</HI></P>
<P>But I need not in&s;i&s;t longer on the&s;e Conje|ctures, &s;ince the Controver&s;ie was decided long ago by Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> the Fourth, who taking it for granted, that the Bones of <HI>Con&s;tantia</HI> Daughter to <HI>Con&s;tantin,</HI> were enclos'd here,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ann.</HI> 1255.</NOTE> took 'em out, and having plac'd 'em as Relicks un|der the Altar which he built in this little Tem|ple, dedicated both to St. <HI>Con&s;tantia.</HI></P>
<P>The Tabernacle of the high Altar of St. <HI>Ag|nes</HI> is &s;upported by four pretty large and ex|treamly-well poli&s;h'd Pillars of Porphyry. We were inform'd, that the little Statue we &s;aw there, was formerly the Statue of a <HI>Pagan Deity,</HI> but has &s;ince been adopted, and con&s;ecrated to be for the future the Statue of St. <HI>Agnes.</HI> Its

<P>I might entertain you with an account of many other Antiquities which I ob&s;erv'd in the Cabinets we have vi&s;ited, and particularly in that of the Cavalier <HI>Pietro Paulo Manini,</HI> but my Letters are already &s;o &s;tuff'd with &s;uch De&s;cri|ptions, that I &s;hall content my &s;elf with men|tioning &s;ome of tho&s;e that I had time to con&s;ider in the Cabinet of Mr. <HI>Bellori.</HI> The Curio&s;ities it contains are not extraordinarily numerous, but they are all well cho&s;en, and every thing in it is ab&s;olutely rare and perfect. His <HI>Fortuna Pan|thea</HI> is a little <HI>Signum</HI> of Bra&s;s half a foot high, and extreamly well pre&s;erv'd. How odd were the Imaginations of the Heathens! The Gods govern'd the World, while they them&s;elves were &s;ubject to the fanta&s;tical Humours of <HI>For|tune!</HI> This little <HI>Godde&s;s</HI> is &s;urrounded with, or to &s;peak more properly, compos'd of all the Marks and Characters of Divinity that were proper to other Deities; She has the Beauty of <HI>Venus, Juno</HI>'s Crown, <HI>Diana</HI>'s Cre&s;cent, the Miter of <HI>I&s;is, Ceres</HI>'s Horn of Abundance, <HI>Minerva</HI>'s Robe, the Wings of <HI>Fame</HI> or of <HI>Victory, Cupid</HI>'s Quiver, the Goats-skin of <HI>Bacchus, E&s;culapius</HI>'s Serpent, <HI>Fortune</HI>'s Rudder, and &s;everal other marks of Gods and Godde&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erv'd al&s;o the Deify'd <HI>Fau&s;tina,</HI> with her blown-up Veil &s;trew'd with Stars; the <HI>Magna Mater,</HI> or <HI>Natura rerum parens,</HI> who &s;uckles diffe|rent Animals at all her Brea&s;ts; the Godde&s;s <HI>Fortune,</HI> holding in one Hand the Horn of Abun|dance, and in the other the Nail of Nece&s;&s;ity; the <HI>Bu&s;t</HI> of a young <HI>Roman</HI> Nobleman, with his <HI>Bulla aurea</HI> hanging at his Neck; the <HI>Ci&s;trum,</HI>

<P>The ancient Ve&s;&s;el of brown Earth, but fine, and &s;ounding like Porcelane, is another of the Rarities in this Cabinet.

<P>Father <HI>Kircher</HI>'s Cabinet in the <HI>Roman</HI> Col|lege was formerly one of the mo&s;t curious in <HI>Europe,</HI> but it has been very much mangl'd and di&s;member'd: yet there remains &s;till a con&s;ide|rable collection of natural Rarities, with &s;everal mechanical Engines.</P>
<P>It may be ju&s;tly &s;aid, That the <HI>Roman</HI> Col|lege, which is the great College, and principal Hou&s;e of the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> is one of the fine&s;t Palaces in the City; the <HI>Library</HI> is good and nu|merous, but there are no ancient Manu&s;cripts, nor other con&s;iderable Rarities in it.</P>
<P>In a great Hall, which is adorn'd with the Pictures of the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> that have &s;uffer'd <HI>Martyr|dom,</HI> we took notice of the famous <HI>Garnet,</HI> that bold Servant of the <HI>Society,</HI> who was drawn,

hang'd, and quarter'd for the <HI>Gun-Powder Trea&s;on.</HI> At his &s;ide there is the Figure of an <HI>Angel,</HI> who encourages him, and &s;hews him the Heavens open'd.</P>
<P>During the three la&s;t days of the <HI>Holy Week,</HI> we met with almo&s;t nothing el&s;e in the Streets of <HI>Rome</HI> but <HI>Proce&s;&s;ions</HI> of <HI>Penitents</HI> of all &s;orts, and in all &s;hapes, who were &s;eeking after Pa|radi&s;e by another way than that of <HI>Garnet.</HI> They had tapering Hoods which cover'd their Heads, leaving only two holes directly oppo&s;ite to their Eyes: &s;ome of the&s;e Penitents were cloath'd in white, others in Violet colour, blew, yellow, and &s;everal other colours; &s;ome<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">'Tis well known that &s;e|veral of 'em are hir'd to play the&s;e Tricks.</NOTE> la&s;h'd their own naked Backs with Whips of &s;mall twi&s;ted Cords, which made more noi&s;e than they did execution: the&s;e are only the puny Scholars of the <HI>Druids</HI> and <HI>Brachman</HI>'s, or, if you will, of the <HI>Indian Faquirs;</HI> but they come very far &s;hort of the <HI>Scotopitae</HI> or <HI>Circumcelliones</HI> of the Fourth Age, who were wont to burn them&s;elves, to cut their own Throats, or to break their Necks for the love of God. There are, and always have been, Fools of all Pro|fe&s;&s;ions; This puts me in mind of an Accident that I cannot forbear relating to you, and of which I was an Eye-witne&s;s.

Town. He went &s;traight up to the top of the Ladder, which was not yet taken away, and untying the Rope that &s;erv'd him for a Girdle, he put it about his Neck with a running Knot, and fa&s;ten'd it to the Gibbet: after which he began very gravely to harangue the Specta|tors, alledging &s;everal Rea&s;ons to excu&s;e the dead Wench, for who&s;e Ran&s;om he &s;aid he had offer'd his Life. He added, That his Crimes exceeded hers, and that he was re&s;olv'd to ex|piate 'em by a &s;udden and voluntary Death: in the mean time the People laugh'd at him, not imagining that he was Fool enough to hang him&s;elf; for he was generally known, and the Bigots had a good opinion of him. However, he ventur'd on the fatal leap, and his Tongue hung out of his Mouth a large minute before any per&s;on came to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but at la&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Bourdin</HI> a Turner, and Keeper of a Bil|liard Table on the Ca&s;tle-ditch.</NOTE> one of the Company, more charitable than the red, cut the Cord, and, tho' not without &s;ome difficulty, &s;av'd the extravagant Wretch.

<P>There was not &s;o numerous a concour&s;e of Pilgrims this year as has been formerly.

<P>I mu&s;t not forget to tell you, that we never yet met the <HI>Sacrament</HI> in <HI>Rome,</HI> nor in any other Town in <HI>Italy,</HI> &s;ave only at <HI>Venice,</HI> where we &s;aw it twice, under a magnificent Canopy not unlike to the Doge's <HI>Ombrella,</HI> and &s;urrounded with a great number of Torches.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Would not neglect the occa&s;ion of writing to you the day after our arrival at <HI>Florence,</HI> tho' I could not then give you any account of this lovely City. We have &s;een &s;o many things in it &s;ince, that my Journal would furni&s;h me with &s;ufficient matter for a Volume. But, in pur&s;uance of my wonted method, I &s;hall in the fir&s;t place give you a brief de&s;cription of it, and afterwards proceed to communicate &s;ome particular Ob&s;ervations, which perhaps will be new to you.</P>
<P><HI>Florence,</HI> the chief City of <HI>Tu&s;cany,</HI> Seat of an Archbi&s;hop, and Re&s;idence of the <HI>Great Duke,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>FLORENCE</HI> the Fair.</NOTE> is &s;ituated on the River <HI>Arno,</HI> as it were in the middle of the <HI>Arena</HI> or bottom of an Amphi|theater. At the di&s;tance of four or five miles, excepting only the &s;ide that looks towards <HI>Pi|&s;toya,</HI> it is &s;urrounded with very fertile Hillocks, which ri&s;e in&s;en&s;ibly, and by degrees unite them&s;elves to the high Mountains. The va&s;t number of Hou&s;es which cover both the little Hills, and the interjacent Plain, make a very delightful and admirable Pro&s;pect. If from one of the Towers of <HI>Florence</HI> you took a view of this large Bottom, &s;o full of Villages and Hou|&s;es
<PB N="170" REF="312">
of Plea&s;ure, you would think it were an al|mo&s;t infinite continuation of the Suburbs of the Town; and it may be ju&s;tly &s;aid, that this rich and delicious Valley is the be&s;t inhabited place in the World.</P>
<P>I was inform'd by a curious and exact Per|&s;on, that the Walls of this City are ju&s;t Fifteen thou&s;and Two hundred and forty <HI>Bra&s;&s;es</HI> or Fathoms in compa&s;s; and that the River <HI>Arno,</HI> which runs thro' it, is Five hundred Fathoms broad; &s;o that reckoning the double breadth of the River, with the circumference of the Walls, the Circuit of <HI>Florence</HI> amounts in all to Sixteen thou&s;and Two hundred and forty fa|thoms. Three of the&s;e Fathoms make exactly five Feet and eight Inches <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> mea&s;ure; and con&s;equently 16240 Fathoms amount to Thirty thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and &s;eventy five Feet, which you may reduce as you think fit. The City is pretty round.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Per&s;on a&s;&s;ur'd me, that <HI>Florence</HI> contains within its Walls Eight thou&s;and and eight hundred Hou&s;es, Sixty thou&s;and Souls, Two and twenty Ho&s;pitals, Eighty and nine Convents, Four&s;core and four Fraternities, a Hundred fifty and two Churches, Eighteen Halls or Galleries belonging to Merchants, Seventy and two Courts of Ju&s;tice, &s;ix Columns, two Pyramids, four Bridges, &s;even Fountains, &s;eventeen <HI>Places</HI> or <HI>Courts,</HI> and a Hundred and &s;ixty public Statues. The Streets are pav'd with large pieces of a greyi&s;h Stone, call'd <HI>Pietra forte,</HI> which is brought from the neigh|bouring Quarries. A good number of the Hou&s;es are built with the &s;ame Stone, and
<PB N="171" REF="312">
many of 'em are extraordinarily large and beautiful. And even there are &s;ome who pre|tend that the <HI>Florentine Palaces,</HI> to &s;peak after the <HI>Italian</HI> manner are the hand&s;ome&s;t Structures in <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>The<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Near the great Gate of this Palace there is a large Magnet, which was &s;poil'd by the Fire. <HI>Spon</HI> &s;ays, that it weighs <HI>5000</HI> pounds.</NOTE> Palace <HI>Pitti,</HI> where the <HI>Great Duke</HI> lodges, is a magnificent Building, and extoll'd beyond mea&s;ure by the People of the Country. Yet I ob&s;erv'd one fault in it, which is the lit|tlene&s;s of the Court with re&s;pect to the Build|ing: you will be of the &s;ame opinion after I have told you, that the heighth of the Palace to the Corni&s;h of the third Order amounts to a hundred and twenty two feet, and yet the Court is but a hundred and &s;ixty foot long, and a hun|dred and forty broad: &s;o that you cannot chu&s;e a place in all the Court to view the Palace, with|out lifting up your Head in a very trouble&s;ome manner.</P>
<P>Before we enter'd into the old Ducal Palace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The four Statues of white Marble on the Bridge of the <HI>Trinity</HI> re|pre&s;ent the four <HI>Sea&s;ons.</HI> They were made by <HI>Michael Angelo.</HI></NOTE> where all tho&s;e rare and precious things are to be &s;een that make &s;o great a noi&s;e in the World, we took a view of the Statues in the <HI>Place</HI> or Court.

<P>The great Gallery of the Palace is almo&s;t Four hundred foot long; the underfretting of the Roof is painted; and we walk'd between two Ranks of Statues and Bu&s;ts, which are al|mo&s;t all Antique Pieces. On the top, again&s;t the Wall, are the Portraictures of the ancient Philo&s;ophers on one &s;ide, and tho&s;e of famous Captains on the other.</P>

<P>From this Gallery we pa&s;s'd thro' &s;everal Chambers full of Rarities. I ob&s;erv'd in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> a branch'd <HI>Candle&s;tick</HI> of great pieces of <HI>Amber,</HI> a fair <HI>Column</HI> of Oriental <HI>Alaba&s;ter,</HI> a <HI>Rhinoceros</HI>'s Horn of an unu&s;ual bigne&s;s, many <HI>Ba&s;&s;o-relievo's,</HI> and other antique Sculptures; Me|dals, Idols, and Sepulchral Lamps; Stones, Mi|nerals, and other natural Curio&s;ities.</P>

And, after all, it would not be a very difficult task to build an enclining Tower; you are not ignorant of the Rea&s;ons on which &s;uch an Operation might be ground|ed, and you may try the Experiment when you plea&s;e, by making a pile of the Men on your Tables. This Tower puts me in mind of a Story related by <HI>Childrey,</HI> one of your <HI>Engli&s;h Naturali&s;ts,</HI> that there is a Steeple in <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> which is variou&s;ly agitated, according to the motion of the Bells.</P>

<P>The Inhabitants of our <HI>Regio</HI> &s;tile their Prince Duke of <HI>Regio</HI> and <HI>Modena;</HI> as, you know, the <HI>Scots</HI> put the name of their Country before that of <HI>England,</HI> in the Title of the King.</P>
<P>Eight miles from <HI>Regio</HI> we pa&s;s'd over the River <HI>En&s;a</HI> on a Bridge, and enter'd, on the other &s;ide, into the Dutchy of <HI>Parma.</HI> The Country is &s;till plain, but we meet with many Pa&s;tures; whereas about <HI>Bologna</HI> and <HI>Modena</HI> al|mo&s;t all the Grounds are till'd.</P>
<P><HI>Parma</HI> is &s;eventeen miles from the Bridge of <HI>En&s;a;</HI> we perceiv'd the City at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, becau&s;e of the breadth and &s;treight|ne&s;s of the Road that leads to it, which di&s;co|vers its highe&s;t Spires. The entry into it is very plea&s;ant, and the City it &s;elf de&s;erves the &s;ame Character. Over the Gate thro' which we enter'd we &s;aw the Arms of Pope <HI>Paul</HI> III. You know that Pontife created his Ba&s;tard Son <HI>Lewis,</HI> Duke of <HI>Parma</HI> and <HI>Placenza,</HI> the&s;e Terri|tories having been before united to the <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal State.</HI> The Citadel of <HI>Parma</HI> was built on the Model of that of <HI>Antwerp;</HI> and the Fortifi|cations of the City are al&s;o very good. It is divided by the River of <HI>Parma,</HI> which runs thro' the middle of it; but this River is not navigable.</P>
<P>There is nothing extraordinary in the Ducal Palace, but they are building another which will be larger and more regular. The Stables are hand&s;om, the Coaches very rich, and the Wardrobe well furni&s;h'd. The great Theater
<PB N="197" REF="325">
is a very rare Structure, and neither <HI>Paris</HI> nor <HI>Venice</HI> can boa&s;t of the like. It is extreamly large, and yet the &s;ofte&s;t Whi&s;per may be heard thro' all the parts of it. In&s;tead of Boxes, the Floor is &s;urrounded with Benches, rais'd after the manner of an Amphitheater: It is al&s;o much larger than the Floors of Theaters are u&s;ually made, and may be fill'd with Water to the heighth of above three feet. This little Lake is cover'd with gilt Boats, which make a very charming Spectacle, by the help of a fine illumination.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the ordinary Schools of the Univer&s;i|ty, there is a large and fair College, call'd the College of the Nobility. They receive Scholars of all Nations, who are capable of being ad|mitted Knights of <HI>Malta.</HI> Not only the Scien|ces, but all manner of Exerci&s;es are taught here; and the Pen&s;ions are different, according to the variety of the Studies. The Scholars eat toge|ther in a Refectory, and their number at pre&s;ent amounts to Two hundred and thirty.</P>
<P>The Dome of the Cathedral was painted by <HI>Corregio;</HI> and there are &s;everal good Pictures in the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">At St. <HI>John</HI>'s and St. <HI>Antho|ny</HI>'s.</NOTE> Principal Churches.</P>

<P>The &s;ituation of <HI>Mantua</HI> is not unlike to that of <HI>Peronne,</HI> but with this difference, that the la&s;t, be&s;ides its Mari&s;h, is well fortified; whereas <HI>Mantua</HI> is enclos'd only with a Wall, tho' 'tis al&s;o defended by a &s;trong Citadel.</P>

<P><PB N="226" REF="340">'Tis true, there are &s;ome Hou&s;es in the <HI>Strada nu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">va</HI> that are richly adorn'd with Marble, and even the Fronts of four or five of 'em are al|mo&s;t wholly built of it, but the&s;e are all the Marble Hou&s;es in <HI>Genoa;</HI> and I leave you to judge whether this be a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on to pretend that the <HI>whole City is built of Marble,</HI> or whether it might not be affirm'd on better grounds, That <HI>London</HI> is wholly built of <HI>Stone,</HI> or <HI>Paris</HI> of <HI>Brick.</HI></P>
<P>But tho' <HI>Genoa</HI> is not wholly built of Marble it may ju&s;tly boa&s;t of &s;ome very beautiful Stru|ctures; for the Hou&s;es are extreamly large and fair in the five or &s;ix Streets that are of a con&s;iderable breadth, and in the magnificent Suburb of <HI>S. Pietro d'Arena.</HI> And be&s;ides, Slate and Gla&s;s are as common here, as they are rare in mo&s;t other parts of <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>I have heard &s;o often of the <HI>Gardens in the Air,</HI> that are to be &s;een in this City, that I think my &s;elf oblig'd to give you &s;ome account of 'em. If the Relations of Travellers were exact|ly true, and things were call'd by their own proper Names, tho&s;e who never &s;aw <HI>Genoa</HI> would not form &s;uch lofty Ideas of the&s;e pre|tended Gardens in the Air, as if they were Machins of an <HI>Opera,</HI> or Imitations of the fa|mous Gardens of <HI>Semiramis.</HI> There is &s;o lit|tle even Ground in this City, that, as I inti|mated before, they are oblig'd to make the Streets narrow, and the Hou&s;es very high, from whence you may rea&s;onably conclude, that there is not much &s;pare room for Gardens. To &s;upply that Defect, &s;everal Per&s;ons adorn the Balconies of their Hou&s;es with Flower-pots,

and &s;ome perhaps cover 'em with Earth, when the Buildings are all to bear the weight of it; the&s;e are the <HI>Gardens in the Air</HI> that make &s;o great a noi&s;e in the World, tho' there are many other things that are not &s;o much as heeded, which in this &s;ence may be &s;aid to be <HI>in the Air.</HI></P>
<P>The mo&s;t beautiful Edifices receiv'd no hurt by the <HI>French Bombs,</HI> which were level'd direct|ly at the Heart of the City, where the Hou&s;es were thicke&s;t; and 'tis but too apparent they were not thrown there in vain; for notwith|&s;tanding all the Reparations that have been made &s;ince, there are at pre&s;ent above Five hundred ruinous Hou&s;es in one part of the City. And mo&s;t of the private Sufferers in that gene|ral Calamity had the double misfortune to lo&s;e all that they had, by lo&s;ing their Habitations; &s;o that they were not only incapacitated to re|build 'em, but even were not able to pay the charge of removing the Rubbi&s;h. 'Tis plain then, that they who have a mind to &s;ee <HI>Genoa the Proud,</HI> mu&s;t not look for it here.</P>
<P>In the Church of <HI>Our Lady of the Vineyards</HI> they &s;how'd us a Bomb which fell there with|out doing the lea&s;t execution, and I believe would gladly have told us, that this was an Effect of its Reverence to &s;o &s;acred a place, if &s;ome le&s;s re&s;pectful Bombs had not thrown down four or five other Churches, and as many Convents.</P>
<P>During that fatal &s;howre of Fire and Brim|&s;tone, the Doge, with thirty Per&s;ons more, took &s;helter in the great Ho&s;pital call'd the <HI>Albergo,</HI> which being very high and large, not only

<P>The Haven of <HI>Genoa</HI> is large, and of a con|venient depth, but it lies open to the <HI>Lubeccio</HI> or <HI>African</HI> Wind, which is almo&s;t South We&s;t, and is the mo&s;t dangerous Wind that reigns in in this part of the <HI>Mediterranean.</HI> So that they were forc'd to make a little &s;ecure Harbour within the Port for their Galleys, of which at pre&s;ent they have only &s;ix; to &s;o &s;mall a num|ber are the once formidable Navies of <HI>Genoa</HI> now reduc'd.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN our Journey from <HI>Genoa</HI> to <HI>Cazal</HI> we were oblig'd to return by the way we came, to <HI>Novi,</HI> where we hir'd a Coach to <HI>Turin,</HI> and the next day din'd at the little City of <HI>Alexan|dria.</HI></P>
<P>The Art of be&s;ieging Towns was hardly known when <HI>Frederic Barbaro&s;&s;a</HI>'s Army lay &s;ix months before <HI>Alexandria,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ALEXAN|DRIA.</NOTE> without being able to take it. The Fortifications of this place are very mean.</P>
<P>That Emperor call'd it <HI>Cae&s;area,</HI> but Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> III. would have it nam'd <HI>Alexandria.</HI> 'Tis fal&s;e that ever any Emperors were crown'd in this City with a Crown of <HI>Straw:</HI> and I be|lieve 'tis hard to prove the Truth of another Story, which &s;ays, that <HI>Frederic</HI> in deri&s;ion call'd it <HI>Alexandria of Straw.</HI> However, it re|tains that name to this very day.</P>
<P><HI>Cazal</HI> is a well fortified City,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CAZAL</NOTE> &s;eated on the right Bank of the <HI>Po.</HI> The old Ca&s;tle is not u&s;ele&s;s, but the new Citadel is a very impor|tant place. It has &s;ix great Royal Ba&s;tions, Half-Moons before the Curtains, a broad and
<PB N="234" REF="345">
deep Ditch full of Water, and an Ar&s;enal fur|ni&s;h'd with Arms for Ten thou&s;and Men. There were formerly &s;ome Irregularities in the Fortifications, but the <HI>French</HI> have put all things in order. I mu&s;t not forget to tell you, that they have doubl'd all the Ba&s;tions; for the old Ba&s;tions were &s;o large, that there was room enough within 'em to make a &s;econd Rampart, which without the lea&s;t confu&s;ion forms a new Ba&s;tion in the middle of the former. The Town belongs &s;till to the Duke of <HI>Mantua,</HI> who receives &s;ome incon&s;iderable Duties from it, and the <HI>French</HI> Garri&s;on keeps it for him.</P>
<P>Leaving <HI>Cazal,</HI> we pa&s;s'd a fourth time over the famous<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Po.</NOTE> <HI>Eridanus,</HI> and our Coach for a long time after follow'd the Banks of that Ri|ver. We pa&s;s'd by the Gate of <HI>Trin,</HI> a little fortified Town, in that part of <HI>Montferrat</HI> which belongs to the Duke of <HI>Savoy. Verrua</HI> is a much &s;tronger place, on a ri&s;ing Ground, on the right &s;ide of the <HI>Po.</HI></P>
<P>Eight miles from <HI>Cazal</HI> we enter'd into <HI>Pied|mont,</HI> the Land being &s;till level. As we ad|vanc'd further, we found our &s;elves engag'd among the Mountains, in a large and flat Valley almo&s;t entirely &s;urrounded with the highe&s;t <HI>Alps.</HI> Where this Plain is good, no|thing can be better, but there are &s;ome places in it that do not at all merit that Character.</P>
<P>Hail is the Scourge of <HI>Piedmont.</HI> As we pa&s;s'd along we took notice of two or three large &s;pots of Ground, where but two days be|fore it had made a prodigious havock on the fine&s;t Corn-fields in the World. The Straw
<PB N="235" REF="345">
was chop'd and driven into the Ground; and even the Walnut-trees, Vines, and other Trees were half broken.</P>
<P>They reckon but Five and forty miles from <HI>Cazal</HI> to <HI>Turin,</HI> but the miles in <HI>Piedmont</HI> and <HI>Montferrat</HI> are much larger than the common miles of <HI>Lombardy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Turin</HI> is &s;ituated in a Plain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">TURIN.</NOTE> on the River <HI>Doire,</HI> Three hundred paces from the <HI>Po.</HI> 'Tis a very plea&s;ant Town, all its Avenues are chearful and delicious; and that which makes us more &s;en&s;ibly charm'd with the free and agree|able Humour of the Inhabitants, is our Abhor|rence and late Experience of that intolerable Sowrene&s;s and Un&s;ociablene&s;s that reigns over all the re&s;t of <HI>Italy,</HI> where we convers'd more with Statues than Men. With re&s;pect to the manner of living, <HI>Turin</HI> is not inferiour to the polite&s;t Cities in <HI>France:</HI> the Language of that Kingdom is as commonly &s;poken here as the <HI>Italian;</HI> the People are generally well bred and hand&s;om, and there is not a Court in <HI>Europe</HI> more &s;prightly and gay than that of the Duke of <HI>Savoy.</HI></P>
<P>The old part of <HI>Turin</HI> cannot boa&s;t of much Beauty, but the new half is built after a quite different manner. The Streets are broad, and &s;treight as a Line, the Hou&s;es large, high, and almo&s;t all uniform. There cannot be a finer Street than that which pa&s;&s;es thro' the two open <HI>Places,</HI> and reaches from the Ca&s;tle to the new Gate. Both the&s;e <HI>Places</HI> are large, and of a re|gular Figure; but the new one is encompa&s;s'd
<PB N="236" REF="346">
with Hou&s;es in exact Symmetry, and a large Portico runs all about it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">There is the old and new Palace.</NOTE>The Duke's Palace makes not &s;o fine an ap|pearance on the out-&s;ide as the Apartments within it are beautiful.

<P>Tho' this City was almo&s;t doubl'd under the late Duke, 'tis &s;till of a very indifferent large|ne&s;s: the &s;ame Prince enclos'd it with a regular and well-lin'd Fortification, The Citadel is very &s;trong and hand&s;om, tho' not yet quite fini&s;h'd; 'tis countermin'd throughout, and has the conveniency of a good Well, where Hor&s;es go down and come up without meeting, by a &s;ort of double Stairs without Steps, which wind about &s;o often, that the De&s;cent is very ea&s;ie.</P>
<P>The Rows of Oaks on the Ramparts of the Town make a very plea&s;ant Walk, which has al&s;o the advantage of a very fine Pro&s;pect, e&s;pecially towards the Rivers; but the greate&s;t Concour&s;e of People is u&s;ually about <HI>Valentin,</HI> a Hou&s;e of Plea&s;ure on the Banks of the <HI>Po,</HI> about a mile from <HI>Turin.</HI> The Duke has &s;e|ven or eight others, all well furni&s;h'd, and kept in good order.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not forget to give you &s;ome account of the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Of <HI>Guarini</HI>'s Architecture.</NOTE> Chapel that is almo&s;t fini&s;h'd at the Cathedral, to the honour of the <HI>Holy Handker|chief.</HI> 'Tis certainly very magnificent; but, in&s;tead of telling you as &s;ome have done, that
<PB N="237" REF="346">
it excels the Chapel of St. <HI>Laurence</HI> at <HI>Florence,</HI> I can a&s;&s;ure you 'tis not at all comparable to that noble Structure. If you have not forgot the De&s;cription of that <HI>Florentin</HI> Chapel in one of my former Letters, you may ea&s;ily make the parallel between that and this of <HI>Turin:</HI> af|ter I have told you that they are both of al|mo&s;t the &s;ame figure, but that the la&s;t is le&s;s than the former, and will be only embelli&s;h'd with black Marble.</P>
<P>The<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI>Reiskius</HI> has written a Di&s;&s;ertation <HI>de Imaginibus Chri|&s;ti,</HI> where you may find many curious Remarks on this Relick: He demon&s;trates, that neither this nor &s;everal others were ever heard of, till Venerable <HI>Beda</HI> publi&s;h'd his vain Imaginations in his Treati&s;e <HI>de locis Sanctis.</HI> This Reverend <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prie&s;t died about the middle of the Eighth Age.</NOTE> pretended <HI>Holy Handker|chief</HI> is the mo&s;t important and valu'd Relic in <HI>Turin,</HI> as you may judge by the honour that is &s;hown to it.

There are, I think, two of 'em at <HI>Rome,</HI> at St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s and St. <HI>John de Lateran,</HI> one at <HI>Cadoin</HI> in <HI>Perigort,</HI> one at <HI>Be&s;ancon,</HI> one at <HI>Compeigne,</HI> one at <HI>Milan,</HI> and another at <HI>Aix la Chapelle.</HI> I can't imagin how the Controver&s;ie between the&s;e Competi|tors can be decided, &s;ince they all produce Pa|pal Bulls to confirm their Titles; but the <HI>Handkerchief</HI> of <HI>Cadoin</HI> &s;eems to have the advan|tage over the re&s;t, as being authoriz'd by four|teen Bulls, whereas that of <HI>Turin</HI> can only &s;hew four.</P>
<P>Since we are ju&s;t going to take leave of <HI>Italy,</HI> I &s;hall take this occa&s;ion to entertain you with &s;ome Ob&s;ervations which I either forgot or had not opportunity to in&s;ert in my former Letters.
<PB N="238" REF="347">
Our &s;hort &s;tay in the places thro' which we pa&s;s'd would not &s;uffer us to &s;pend much time in making acquaintance with the People of the Country, and con&s;equently we could not be very particularly inform'd of their Cu&s;toms: neither do I intend to enter on that Subject, but only to communicate &s;ome Remarks to you without any other order, than as they &s;hall offer them&s;elves to my Memory.</P>

<P>To return to our Game; it mu&s;t be ac|knowledg'd, that <HI>Quails</HI> are not &s;o great Rarities here as <HI>Partridges,</HI> for when the Spring approa|ches they come in Flocks from <HI>Afric,</HI> and cover the whole Country.

They may be caught in heaps without the lea&s;t trouble, but &s;ince they are extreamly lean, tho&s;e who take 'em u&s;ually feed 'em for &s;ome time before they eat 'em. I believe 'tis uncertain whether the&s;e Birds fly over the Sea, or whether they do not &s;ometimes &s;wim to take breath: 'tis indeed hard to conceive that the <HI>Quail</HI> which has not a &s;trong Wing, and flies heavily, &s;hould be able to continue its flight &s;o long. But, on the other &s;ide, I'm inclin'd to believe that the Water would &s;o moi&s;ten and drench its Fea|thers, that it could never &s;pread its Wings again. And, be&s;ides its leanne&s;s and wearine&s;s, the Dangers to which it expo&s;es its &s;elf, and its ea|gerne&s;s to find a re&s;ting place, are, in my opi|nion, convincing Arguments that it flies all the way without intermi&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Veillana.</NOTE>WE lay at <HI>Veillana</HI> the fir&s;t night after our departure from <HI>Turin,</HI> next morning we pa&s;s'd by the Gate of <HI>Su&s;a,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">SUSA.</NOTE> a little City, &s;eated among the Mountains, by which 'tis commanded almo&s;t on every &s;ide, and din'd at <HI>Novale&s;a,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Novale&s;a. Mount Cenis.</NOTE> at the foot of <HI>Mount Cenis.</HI></P>
<P>This is the highe&s;t Mountain of the <HI>Alps,</HI> over which there is a Pa&s;&s;age; but you mu&s;t not conclude from thence that it is another <HI>Cauca&s;us</HI> or <HI>Tenerif;</HI> neither mu&s;t you fancy it to be a &s;ingle Hill, or that the Way lies over the top of it. For when a Traveller comes to the highe&s;t part of the Pa&s;&s;age, he finds him|&s;elf in a Plain, or a new Valley, with re&s;pect to the lofty Mountains that &s;urround it.</P>
<P>At <HI>Novale&s;a</HI> we took Mules to a&s;cend the Hill. The Way is pretty broad, and free from Precipices, but uneven and full of Stones. On the highe&s;t acce&s;&s;ible part of it there is a Cro&s;s that divides <HI>Piedmont</HI> from <HI>Savoy,</HI> and con&s;e|quently is one of the Boundaries of <HI>Italy.</HI> In the middle of the Plain there is a Lake of &s;o great a depth, that, if we may believe the com|mon Report, its Bottom could never be reach'd by &s;ounding; it is a large mile in compa&s;s, and
<PB N="255" REF="355">
&s;ends forth a great Brook, which falls into the little <HI>Doire</HI> near <HI>Su&s;a.</HI></P>
<P>The Snow was almo&s;t all melted on the Hill; 'tis true, the highe&s;t tops of the Mountain on both &s;ides were cover'd with it, but there were only &s;ome Heaps left here and there in the pa&s;|&s;age. The tumbling of the Snow makes the pa&s;&s;age dangerous in &s;ome places, and in &s;ome Sea&s;ons of the Year, otherwi&s;e there is no dan|ger at all in it.</P>
<P>The &s;ide of the Hill towards <HI>Savoy</HI> is much rougher than the other, and Travellers are u&s;ually carried this part of the way by Men, tho' they might pa&s;s it on Hor&s;eback, as <HI>Char|lemain</HI>'s Army did heretofore. They made us &s;it down in ordinary Chairs, to which they had fa&s;ten'd Arms like the Shafts of a Litter. We were each of us attended by four Men, two who bore the Chair, and two more to relieve their Fellows.</P>
<P>At the foot of the Hill we pa&s;s'd the little River <HI>Arche,</HI> on a Bridge of Wood, to the Village of <HI>La&s;neburg.</HI></P>
<P>I have almo&s;t nothing to relate concerning <HI>Savoy.</HI> The Country is generally mountainous, and we found hardly any thing remarkable in that part of it thro' which we pa&s;s'd.</P>
<P><HI>Chambery,</HI> the Metropolis of the Dutchy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAMBERY.</NOTE> formerly the Re&s;idence of the Dukes, and now the Seat of a Parliament, is a very &s;mall and unfortified City, &s;eated at the foot of the Mountains near the Confluence of the <HI>Le&s;&s;a</HI> and <HI>Orbana,</HI> neither of which is navigable.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">MONTME|LIAN.</NOTE>Neither did we &s;top at <HI>Montmelian,</HI> which is a little City on the right Bank of the <HI>I&s;era,</HI> defen|ded by a Citadel indifferently &s;trong.</P>

<P>About <HI>Annecy</HI> we found the whole Country in a general Con&s;ternation for fear of the <HI>Vau|dois;</HI> there was a Report, That above Two thou&s;and of the&s;e poor Exiles were enter'd into <HI>Savoy,</HI> towards <HI>Evian,</HI> and had already burnt five or &s;ix Villages: but there was not the lea&s;t Ground for &s;uch an Alarm.</P>
<P>The Dutchy of <HI>Savoy</HI> is &s;eparated from the Territory of <HI>Geneva</HI> by the River <HI>Arve,</HI> over which there is a Bridge of Wood that leads al|mo&s;t to the Gates of <HI>Geneva.</HI> The <HI>Arve</HI> is a great Torrent, which falls from the Mountains, and always brings &s;ome Gold-du&s;t along with it,
<PB N="257" REF="356">
but it happens very rarely that a Man is able to refine &s;o much of it in a day, as he might earn at &s;ome other Work; and therefore this Gold is almo&s;t wholly neglected.</P>
<P>I will not undertake to give you an account of the Antiquity, Government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">GENEVA.</NOTE> or Hi&s;tory of <HI>Geneva,</HI> of which we have had &s;o many De|&s;criptions. I &s;hall content my &s;elf with giving you a general Idea of this City, to which (&s;ince I had occa&s;ion formerly to be pretty well ac|quainted with it) I &s;hall add &s;ome particular Ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>The <HI>Rhone,</HI> at its coming out of the Lake, forms a little I&s;land. On the right Bank of the River, or rather toward its right Channel, the Land is low and even, but on the other &s;ide there is a Hillock that ri&s;es in&s;en&s;ibly. The principal part of the City is &s;eated on this Hil|lock, the re&s;t of it is in the I&s;land, and beyond the <HI>Rhone;</HI> and the whole is encompa&s;s'd with a Fortification.</P>
<P>The Republic of <HI>Geneva</HI> is in League with the <HI>Switzers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Republic of <HI>Geneva</HI> enter'd into a perpetual League with that of <HI>Bern, An. 1536,</HI> which has been fre|quently renew'd &s;ince. <HI>J. Simler.</HI></NOTE> particularly with the Cantons of <HI>Zurich</HI> and <HI>Bern,</HI> and in this their great Strength con&s;i&s;ts. Their Ramparts may pre&s;erve 'em from a &s;udden Surpri&s;al, and might perhaps protect 'em again&s;t all the Force of <HI>Savoy.</HI> But tho' the&s;e Fortifications are not contemptible, they could not long re&s;i&s;t a more potent Ene|my, if the State had nothing el&s;e to depend on.</P>
<P>They have good &s;tore of Cannon, and a well-furni&s;h'd Ar&s;enal, where they pre&s;erve the famous <HI>Ladders</HI> that were made u&s;e of by the <HI>Savoyards</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">In the year <HI>1602.</HI></NOTE> in the <HI>Scalado</HI> of which you have
<PB N="258" REF="357">
doubtle&s;s read an account. In the &s;ame place they keep the <HI>Petard</HI> that was de&s;ign'd to bur&s;t open the new Gate. The&s;e are two la&s;ting Monuments of their Deliverance, in memory of which they &s;till continue to &s;olemnize a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Decemb.</HI> 12/22.</NOTE> Fe|&s;tival, with Thank&s;giving, and extraordinary Sermons &s;uitable to the occa&s;ion, and al&s;o with little Fea&s;ts, or rather with joining the Meals of &s;everal Families, according to the various Tyes of Relation and Friend&s;hip, by which they are united: They never part without &s;ing|ing a Song that was made about the time of that Action, of which it comprehends the prin|cipal Circum&s;tances, and is now become an e&s;&s;en|tial part of the public rejoicing.</P>
<P>The Republic keeps &s;ome Gallies on its Lake, and there are al&s;o others belonging to the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> and the <HI>Switzers.</HI> I &s;ay <HI>its Lake,</HI> for the Lake was given to the City by its Ma&s;ters when it was a <HI>Roman</HI> Colony, and the common way of Expre&s;&s;ion at pre&s;ent &s;eems to confirm that Donation.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> keeps a<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">Belle-rive.</NOTE> Fort on the Bank of the Lake, at the di&s;tance of a large league from <HI>Geneva,</HI> contrary to the Treaty of St. <HI>Julian,</HI> in which, among &s;everal other Arti|cles, it was concluded and ratified, That the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> &s;hould neither draw any Forces together, nor make Fortifications, nor keep a Garri&s;on within four leagues of <HI>Geneva.</HI></P>
<P>The Opinion of &s;ome ancient Authors, that the <HI>Rhone</HI> pa&s;&s;es thro' the Lake without min|gling with its Water, is not only fabulous, but ab&s;urd and impo&s;&s;ible, con&s;idering the length

and crooked figure of the Lake. <HI>C. Frey</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">After <HI>Polybus.

<P>The Water of this Lake is extreamly pure and limpid; it affords &s;everal kinds of excellent Fi&s;hes, but its <HI>Trouts</HI> are mo&s;t famous:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>The <HI>pound</HI> of <HI>Geneva</HI> contains <HI>Eighteen Oun|ces.</HI></P>
<P>The Lake is well &s;tock'd with ex|cellent Fi&s;h, but their numbers do &s;en&s;ibly de|crea&s;e, and one &s;ort is quite lo&s;t, it is not only to be a&s;crib'd to the ravenou&s;ne&s;s of the Pikes that abound in it, but to another &s;ort of Fi&s;h, that they call <HI>Mou|tails,</HI> which were never taken in the Lake till within the&s;e &s;ix years la&s;t pa&s;t; they are in the Lake of <HI>Neufcha&s;tel,</HI> and &s;ome other Lakes of <HI>Switzer|land,</HI> and 'tis likely that by &s;ome convcyance under ground they may have come into Channels that fall into this Lake. <HI>G. Burnet.</HI></P></NOTE> I have &s;een &s;everal of 'em that weigh'd Fifty pounds each,and I know there have been &s;ome found bigger than the&s;e by a third part. The&s;e Fi&s;hes are &s;eldom found &s;o big in other places; but this is not a thing without Example, as &s;ome imagin. In one of the Halls of the Ar&s;enal at <HI>Munick</HI> I &s;aw a Figure of a Trout that was taken out of a little Lake in that Country, and weigh'd Seventy three pounds.</P>
<P>Perhaps an account of the u&s;ual way of catching Trouts at <HI>Geneva</HI> will not be unplea|&s;ant to you. You mu&s;t know, that at a certain time of the year that Fi&s;h de&s;cends from the Lake to the <HI>Rhone,</HI> and at other times returns back to the Lake: now, to take advantage of the&s;e Comings and Goings, which con&s;tantly happen at the u&s;ual times, they have planted Piles cro&s;s the River, where it comes out of the Lake, at &s;uch a di&s;tance, that the great Fi&s;hes, whether a&s;cending or de&s;cending, cannot pa&s;s thro' 'em, unle&s;s at certain open places which are
<PB N="260" REF="358">
the Mouths of great Weels of Wire, where they remain till they are taken out. This Fi&s;hery is let out to Farmers by the State, and makes a part of its Revenue. The Piles are thus di&s;pos'd:</P>

'Tis impo&s;&s;ible for a Stranger that has &s;taid &s;ome time in it to leave it without reluctancy. It has the advantage of plea&s;ant Walks; and the Conver&s;ation of the Inhabitants is very familiar and ea&s;ie.

<P>Their Academy is furni&s;h'd with able Profe&s;|&s;ors, and they have al&s;o &s;everal learned Mini|&s;ters.

<P>I told you before, that at <HI>Rome,</HI> and in &s;ome other Towns of <HI>Italy,</HI> the Men never enter into the &s;ame Coach with Women; and the &s;ame cu&s;tom is al&s;o generally ob&s;erv'd here when they go to take the Air.

Thus their divi&s;ion occa&s;ions a more general So|ciety, which would be very diverting, if every one were not oblig'd to &s;alute all that pa&s;s by, and to repeat his Salutations as often as he meets another <HI>Coach.</HI></P>

I cannot give you a po&s;itive account of the Original of this Cu&s;tom, but I had the fortune to be in a company where there were two different Rea&s;ons given for it, and both the oppo&s;ite Parties per&s;i&s;ted ob&s;tinately in their &s;everal Opinions.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="372">Some alledg'd, that on a certain time (which they did not think fit to mention more particu|larly) the City being reduc'd to Extremity after a long Siege, at la&s;t &s;urrender'd on Condition, that the Women &s;hould be &s;uffer'd to depart unmole&s;ted with their little Children, and all that they could carry with 'em be&s;ides; and that in|&s;tead of packing up their Toilettes, every one march'd out with her <HI>Be&s;t-beloved</HI> between her Shoulders, and &s;o cheated their Enemies.</P>
<P>Others, who laugh'd at this Story and call'd it a Fable, a&s;&s;ur'd us, that a con&s;iderable num|ber of the Inhabitants of <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> follow'd St. <HI>Lewis</HI> in his fir&s;t <HI>Croi&s;ado,</HI> and had the good fortune to &s;uffer le&s;s than mo&s;t other Troops which compos'd that numerous Army when it was totally routed: For, continu'd our Infor|mers, the greate&s;t part of 'em either e&s;cap'd or were redeem'd, and afterwards they join'd in a Body to return home. Now their Wives hear|ing of their approach, ran to meet 'em, and in a Tran&s;port of Joy caught 'em up, and carried 'em home in their Arms. But, if I dur&s;t pre|&s;ume to mend the Story, in&s;tead of overloading the Women with &s;o unrea&s;onable a Burden, I would content my &s;elf with making 'em undre&s;s their Husbands the fir&s;t night after their return, by rea&s;on of the good Humour of the former, and the Wearine&s;s of the latter.</P>

his Countrymen, on the following occa&s;ion. When the People of <HI>Ghent</HI> revolted under the Government of the Queen Dowager of <HI>Hunga|ry, Charles</HI> the Fifth's Si&s;ter, and came to &s;ur|prize and plunder this City, the Rabble of the Town &s;allied out of the above-mention'd Gate, arm'd with Spits and Pitchforks, and bravely repuls'd the Enemy.</P>
<P>The fine&s;t Churches in <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> are tho&s;e of St. <HI>Gudula</HI> and of the <HI>Je&s;uits.</HI> The&s;e Fathers have great Bells, &s;uch as are us'd in Pari&s;h Churches, contrary to the u&s;ual Cu&s;tom. They made u&s;e of the Pretext of certain extraordinary Catechi|zings, to obtain leave to ring a &s;mall Bell; but by degrees they left off that trouble&s;om Exer|ci&s;e, and in the mean time augmented their * Bell. This piece of boldne&s;s &s;tirs up the Jealou&s;ie of the other Monks, who were not over-fond of the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> before.</P>
<P>The Chapel of the <HI>Holy Sacrament of Miracles</HI> is particularly taken notice of at St. <HI>Gudula</HI>'s, be|cau&s;e of the Relicks that are kept in it.

<P>One <HI>John Daens,</HI> a Merchant, lent a million of Gold to <HI>Charles</HI> V, (I think) toward the pro&s;ecution of the War of <HI>Hungary:</HI> the Em|peror, at his return from that Expedition, came to <HI>Antwerp,</HI> and was invited to Dinner by his Creditor; he accepted the Invitation, and was &s;plendidly entertain'd; and the Merchant, af|ter he had burnt a Fire of Cinnamon all the while, at la&s;t, to crown the Treat, threw the Emperor's Obligation into the mid&s;t of it.</P>
<P>I need not tell you, that there have happen'd great Alterations &s;ince that time. The Port of <HI>Antwerp</HI> is de&s;titute of Ships; the Exchange is de&s;olate and unfrequented, and the City, tho' &s;till beautiful, enjoys a &s;ad Tranquillity, yet there are many rich Families in it.</P>

It was built in the year 1531, and took its Name from a Hou&s;e that &s;tood former|ly in the &s;ame place, on which there was a Scutcheon charg'd with three<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">Bour&s;es <HI>in</HI> French.</NOTE> <HI>Pur&s;es,</HI> and from that time the public places appointed for the meeting of Merchants have almo&s;t every where retain'd the Name of <HI>Bour&s;e.</HI> The <HI>Town hou&s;e</HI> is al&s;o a very fine Structure.</P>

<P>The Rate of Places in the Stage-Coaches and Boats in <HI>Holland</HI> is fix'd, &s;o that there is no oc|ca&s;ion for contending about the Price, and there|fore it would be needle&s;s to give a particular ac|count of the Rates, which are various, accord|ing to the difference of Places and Di&s;tances.</P>
<P>The Carriage of Baggage mu&s;t be paid apart when a Pa&s;&s;enger has more than a &s;ingle Port|mantle.

'Tis in vain to contend with the Dutch Boat-men, and you mu&s;t either agree on a price for the carriage of your Goods before you put 'em in the Boat, or re&s;olve to give 'em whatever they plea&s;e to ask.</P>
<P>In &s;ome places, as at <HI>Roterdam, Delft,</HI> and the <HI>Hague,</HI> the Boats go off every half-hour; in other parts they ob&s;erve different times of &s;et|ting out, but none of 'em ever &s;tay a moment after the Clock &s;trikes the appointed time of their departure.

<P>At the u&s;ual places of changing the Boats, you always find Men with Wheelbarrows to carry your Baggage; their Rates are &s;o &s;mall that they de&s;erve not to be mention'd.</P>
<P>Our fir&s;t de&s;ign being to vi&s;it <HI>Germany</HI> in our return, and afterwards to repa&s;s thro' <HI>Holland,</HI> we re&s;olv'd at the &s;ame time to &s;ee <HI>North Holland,</HI> but we came another way, and had not time to put that de&s;ign in execution.

But not to retard the pa&s;&s;age, which &s;eems tedious enough other|wi&s;e to tho&s;e who are not furni&s;h'd with a good &s;tock of Patience, the be&s;t way is, to order the provi&s;ions for dinner to be brought in the morn|ing.</P>

The be&s;t way is to make &s;uffi|cient provi&s;ion in <HI>Holland,</HI> of Gold Ducats, and Silver Money of the Emperor's Coin, which are current every where, without any abatement, but &s;omething mu&s;t be allow'd for the exchange of tho&s;e pieces. At <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> for example, you mu&s;t give two or three pence more than the real value of a Ducat, and proportionably as much for the <HI>Pi&s;toles.</HI> But the Exchange of Money ri&s;es or falls, according to the various Junctures of Trade and of the Times.</P>
<P>When Travellers meet together they may exchange the Money they have about 'em; but we mu&s;t not depend on &s;uch accidental Ren|counters, which happen &s;eldom.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Pi&s;tols of full weight are the be&s;t Pieces that can be carried to <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>The Bankers of <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> directed us to the <HI>Neuville</HI>'s their Corre&s;pondents at <HI>Frankfort,</HI> who are very hone&s;t per&s;ons, and us'd us very kindly.</P>
<P>Travellers ought always to procure Letters of Recommendations for &s;ome Per&s;ons of note in tho&s;e Towns where they intend to &s;tay any con&s;iderable time, not only from their own Country, but al&s;o from the places where they &s;top on the Road; for, if any Accident &s;hould
<PB N="309" REF="382">
happen, they will be glad to know where they may find A&s;&s;i&s;tance; and be&s;ides, the Per&s;ons to whom they are recommended may be of u&s;e to &s;hew 'em the Rarities of the Country, to introduce 'em into Acquaintance, and to give 'em nece&s;&s;ary In&s;tructions. The Recommen|dations of Bankers are none of the lea&s;t effe|ctual.</P>
<P>Neither mu&s;t a Traveller forget to take a Pa&s;s-port from the Prince or State who&s;e Subject he is: 'Tis true, the&s;e Pa&s;s-ports are not nece&s;|&s;ary, but they may be u&s;eful, and we were ask'd for ours in &s;ome parts of <HI>Italy;</HI> be&s;ides, &s;uch a Pa&s;s, on &s;ome occa&s;ions, procures Re&s;pect to a Stranger, and an Accident may happen which may make a man repent his neglect of this piece of Caution.</P>
<P>'Tis better to undergo the Lo&s;s that is a ne|ce&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of Bills of Exchange, than to be troubl'd with carrying about a Load of Money. And be&s;ides, one ought not to take more Money along with him, than will be ju&s;t &s;ufficient to defray his Charge from one place to another; for there are a hundred Accidents which may make it very inconvenient for a Stranger to have his Pockets full of &s;uperfluous Ca&s;h.</P>
<P>'Tis a general Rule,<NOTE PLACE="marg">&mdash;Cantabit vacuus coram latrone viator.</NOTE> That a Traveller ought never to make a di&s;covery of his Jewels or Money, e&s;pecially in the Inns; for almo&s;t all the Robberies and Murders that are committed on Pa&s;&s;engers are occa&s;ion'd by their Imprudence in betraying them&s;elves.</P>
<P>At <HI>Francfort</HI> we bought &s;ome Boxes of <HI>Treacle</HI> from Dr. <HI>Peters,</HI> and be&s;ides, we had furni&s;h'd
<PB N="310" REF="383">
our &s;elves with &s;ome &s;uch Provi&s;ions at <HI>London.</HI> Health is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary a Companion to a Tra|veller, that he cannot be too careful of its pre|&s;ervation.</P>
<P>If we had re&s;olv'd to go &s;treight from <HI>Frank|fort</HI> to <HI>Heidelberg,</HI> we might have been accommo|dated, as we were inform'd by our Friends, with the choice of two or three &s;orts of pa&s;|&s;age; but &s;ince we travell'd only to &s;ee the Country, we hir'd a Coach with &s;ix Hor&s;es, to carry us and our Baggage whither&s;oever we pleas'd, for three Crowns a day, paying the &s;ame rate for the return: So that if we had gone directly from <HI>Francfort,</HI> the charge of our Coach would have amounted to &s;ix Crowns a day; but after we had &s;pent four days in tra|ver&s;ing the Country, we left the Coach at <HI>Hey|delberg,</HI> reckoning only two days for its return to <HI>Francfort.</HI></P>
<P>We were forc'd to make another bargain from <HI>Heydelberg</HI> to <HI>Nuremberg,</HI> which, in that Sea&s;on of the year, is &s;ix days Journey: We gave, as I remember, thirty Crowns for the car|riage of our Per&s;ons and Goods, and twenty Crowns for a whole Coach from <HI>Nuremberg</HI> to <HI>Aug&s;purg,</HI> on condition that we &s;hould take <HI>In|gol&s;tat</HI> and <HI>Newburg</HI> in our way. They who go by <HI>Dunavert</HI> make a whole day's Journey le&s;s; but we were re&s;olv'd to &s;ee <HI>Ingol&s;tat,</HI> which is the &s;tronge&s;t place in <HI>Bavaria.</HI></P>
<P>There are Stage Coaches that go from <HI>Aug|&s;purg</HI> to <HI>Venice,</HI> or at lea&s;t to <HI>Me&s;tr&eacute;</HI> near <HI>Venice,</HI> and the Rates of the Places are regulated, but they do not pa&s;s by <HI>Munick,</HI> which we were de&s;irous to &s;ee for &s;everal Rea&s;ons; and be&s;ides,
<PB N="311" REF="383">
the Country is extreamly rough for Coaches, they are very apt to overturn, and the Pa&s;&s;en|gers are often con&s;train'd to alight, by rea&s;on of the continual a&s;cending and de&s;cending among the Mountains.</P>
<P>And therefore we agreed to be carried on Hor&s;eback, and our Charges born from <HI>Aug&s;purg</HI> to <HI>Venice,</HI> by the way of <HI>Munick, In&s;pruck, Bol|&s;ana, Trent, Verona, Vincenza,</HI> and <HI>Padua,</HI> at the rate of twenty Ducats of Gold a head. We made this Bargain by the Advice of an intere&s;s'd per&s;on, but we were inform'd afterwards that we paid too dear by a fifth or &s;ixth part. I thought fit to acquaint the Reader with this pa&s;&s;age, not that he may imitate our Exam|ple, but that he may draw &s;ome Advantage even from our Blunders.</P>
<P>We were de&s;irous to arrive at <HI>Venice</HI> before the <HI>Carnaval,</HI> which was not nece&s;&s;ary, for 'tis &s;ufficient to &s;ee the three la&s;t weeks of it, e&s;pe|cially for tho&s;e who intend not to &s;pend more time in travelling than we determin'd to do.</P>
<P>I advi&s;e tho&s;e who may happen to be at <HI>Aug|&s;purg</HI> at the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on when we were there, and de&s;ign al&s;o to be at <HI>Venice</HI> during the <HI>Car|naval,</HI> to make a particular Bargain for <HI>Munick;</HI> and from thence to go to <HI>Ratisbon,</HI> where they may embark on the <HI>Danube</HI> for <HI>Vienna,</HI> and re|turn to <HI>Venice</HI> by <HI>Saltzburg</HI> and <HI>Palma nuova;</HI> and even they may make a little excur&s;ion from <HI>Vienna</HI> to <HI>Presburg,</HI> that they may be able to &s;ay they have &s;een &s;ome part of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and after all, come in time enough to <HI>Venice.</HI> They may afterwards take occa&s;ion to &s;ee <HI>Padua, Verona,</HI> and <HI>Vincenza.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="312" REF="384">Tho&s;e who are of a tender Con&s;titution will do well to provide good Furs at <HI>Munick,</HI> before they engage in the <HI>Alps,</HI> if they are to pa&s;s 'em in the Winter; for be&s;ides, that they will be in a manner overwhelm'd with Snow; the Cold is very piercing among tho&s;e Mountains.</P>
<P>When one is at <HI>In&s;pruck,</HI> he ought by all means to vi&s;it the Cabinet of Curio&s;ities and other Rarities in the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Amras,</HI> for which little Journey he may hire a Coach of the Inn-keepers. And that he may have time to &s;atisfie his Curio&s;ity, he ought &s;o to contrive his Jour|ney, that he may have half a day to &s;pend in this place.</P>
<P>At <HI>Stertzlinghen,</HI> between <HI>In&s;pruck</HI> and <HI>Trent,</HI> 'tis convenient to leave the direct Road which leads to <HI>Trent,</HI> by the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Tirol,</HI> and to take that of <HI>Brixen.</HI> 'Tis true, the fir&s;t way is &s;horter, but 'tis dangerous by rea&s;on of its Pre|cipices: and for this Rea&s;on the Guide ought to have timely warning to take the Road of <HI>Brixen.</HI></P>
<P>There are &s;ome good Inns at <HI>Venice,</HI> &s;uch as the <HI>Louvre,</HI> the <HI>White Lyon,</HI> and the <HI>French Arms;</HI> but when one intends to &s;pend &s;ome months in that City, the be&s;t way is, to hire a furni&s;h'd Hou&s;e. There are always &s;ome Apartments to be let in the <HI>Procuraties,</HI> which, as it is the dea|re&s;t, is al&s;o the fine&s;t part of the Town. At the <HI>Louvre</HI> you are entertain'd for eight Livres a day, and the <HI>White Lyon</HI> and <HI>French Arms</HI> are &s;ome|what cheaper, but you mu&s;t always remember to make your Bargain for every thing before you go into the Hou&s;e, to avoid after-Debates.</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="384">For &s;even or eight Livres a day, you may hire one of the prettie&s;t Gondola's with two Rowers, whom you may put into Livery, and employ in what &s;ervice you plea&s;e. The ordi|nary Gondola's co&s;t fifteen pence an hour. Twenty pence make a <HI>Livre,</HI> and a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Pi&s;tol contains nine and twenty Livres.</P>
<P>I have already &s;poken of the <HI>Ridotti</HI> at <HI>Venice,</HI> which are Gaming-hou&s;es or Academies of Ba&s;|&s;et, where the Noblemen cut, and Fools lo&s;e their Money.</P>
<P>Here we receiv'd the fir&s;t Letters we had from <HI>England.</HI> A Traveller ought always to acquaint his Corre&s;pondents where he intends to &s;tay for &s;ome time, that they may &s;end their Letters thither, which for the greater Security may be directed to &s;ome Banker. 'Tis true, a Man may make a &s;hift to live without News, but Bills of Exchange are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in a &s;trange Country, and great care mu&s;t be taken to prevent their mi&s;carrying; the &s;ure&s;t way is, to get a Letter of Credit, which is cur|rent every where.</P>
<P>Travellers are not &s;top'd on the account of Cu&s;toms or Imports, either in <HI>Holland</HI> or <HI>Germa|ny,</HI> and rarely in the State of <HI>Venice.</HI> The Toll-gatherers &s;aw us enter into the <HI>Laguna's</HI> without &s;peaking one word to us, tho' we had a con&s;i|derable quantity of Baggage, but in other parts of <HI>Italy</HI> the Tolls are very frequent and trouble|&s;om. Neverthele&s;s you may u&s;ually buy your peace at the rate of a few<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">A Piece of Money about the value of <HI>6</HI> d.</NOTE> <HI>Julio's;</HI> and we ne|ver met with any of tho&s;e Officers &s;o ob&s;tinate as to open our Portmantles, &s;ave only at our arrival at <HI>Rome,</HI> at <HI>Pi&s;a,</HI> as we came from <HI>Leghorn,</HI>
<PB N="314" REF="385">
and at our departure from <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Ber|gamo.</HI></P>
<P>It froze, without intermi&s;&s;ion all the while we &s;taid at <HI>Venice;</HI> and, generally &s;peaking, we found the Winter very &s;harp all over <HI>Italy.</HI> Mo&s;t People are per&s;waded that there is hardly any Winter at all in this Country, and therefore they u&s;ually chu&s;e that Sea&s;on to travel thither: But I can produce &s;everal Rea&s;ons again&s;t the <HI>Winter,</HI> and I know no more than one again&s;t the <HI>Summer.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Winter</HI> the Ways are unea&s;ie and dange|rous, e&s;pecially in the Mountains, by rea&s;on of the Snow and Ice. The Days are &s;hort; a Traveller comes late to his Lodging, and is of|ten forc'd to prevent the Sun in the Morning; be&s;ides, the Country looks di&s;mally, Nature is in a manner half dead, and neither Fruits nor Flowers are any where to be &s;een.</P>
<P>The <HI>Summer</HI> corrects all tho&s;e Inconvenien|cies; 'tis hot, I confe&s;s, but that trouble may be ea&s;ily avoided, by repo&s;ing during the heat of the Day: and be&s;ides, the coldne&s;s of the Winter does &s;ufficiently counterballance the heat of the Summer.</P>
<P>At <HI>Venice</HI> we hir'd a Boat to <HI>Padua</HI> for Four and twenty Livres; but we might have taken places in the common Boat for two Livres a-piece.</P>
<P>At <HI>Padua</HI> we found by chance a Coach which had brought &s;ome Pa&s;&s;engers from <HI>Loretto,</HI> and &s;tay'd for Company to return thither. We hir'd the whole Coach for Fourteen <HI>Spani&s;h Pi&s;tols,</HI> on condition that we &s;hould al&s;o have the u&s;e of a Saddle-hor&s;e, that we might &s;tay
<PB N="315" REF="385">
three days at &s;uch places on the Road as we &s;hould think fit to chu&s;e, that the Ma&s;ter of the Coach &s;hould pay for our pa&s;&s;age over Bridges and Rivers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and carry us by the way of <HI>Ra|venna.</HI></P>
<P>The Charge of the pa&s;&s;age over Rivers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is not very con&s;iderable, but we found it very convenient to ea&s;e our &s;elves of the trouble of it.</P>
<P>'Tis always worth the while to make enquiry whether there are any Coaches, or what other &s;ort of pa&s;&s;age the Traveller intends to make u&s;e of, returning to the place whither he de&s;igns to go, for by &s;o doing he may &s;ave Money con&s;iderably.</P>
<P>Some embark for <HI>Ancona</HI> at <HI>Rimini,</HI> and even at <HI>Venice,</HI> coa&s;ting along the Shore of the Gulf. But when the pa&s;&s;age by Land is ea&s;ie, a curious and judicious Traveller will never chu&s;e to go by Sea.</P>
<P>In many parts of <HI>Italy</HI> you may have Stage-Hor&s;es or Cala&s;hes, the Rates of which are fix'd. The greate&s;t conveniency of this way of travel|ling is, that you may &s;top where you plea&s;e, and change your Hor&s;es or Cala&s;h at every Stage, without being oblig'd to pay for their return; and be&s;ides, you may take what time you plea&s;e to &s;atisfie your Curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>There is conveniency for two Per&s;ons in a Cala&s;h, which I prefer before Hor&s;es for &s;eve|ral Rea&s;ons; in Summer you have the advan|tage of the Shade; they are warmer in Win|ter, and more commodious in all re&s;pects; be|&s;ides, the Pa&s;&s;engers may have their Portman|tles ty'd behind, tho' they &s;hould amount to 200
<PB N="316" REF="386">
weight for each Cala&s;h; but 'tis convenient to look to 'em from time to time, or to make a Servant follow the Cala&s;h on Hor&s;eback, to take care of the Baggage.</P>
<P>The tying and untying of the Portmantles at every Stage is a nece&s;&s;ary piece of trouble that attends this way of travelling; and therefore the be&s;t way for tho&s;e who have a long Journey to make, and intend not to &s;top on the Road, or only to make a &s;hort &s;tay, is, to agree with one Per&s;on for the whole Pa&s;&s;age; and they may ea&s;ily calculate whether the Charge will amount to more than if they &s;hould change their Hor&s;es or Cala&s;hes at every Stage.</P>
<P><HI>Ferrara</HI> was the fir&s;t place where they took our Pi&s;tols from us; they re&s;tor'd 'em at the Gate by which we went out, but we were forc'd to give 'em a little Money.</P>
<P>When you come over again&s;t <HI>Catholica,</HI> be|tween <HI>Rimini</HI> and <HI>Pe&s;aro,</HI> it will not be improper to leave the direct way to &s;ee the little Town and Republic of St. <HI>Marin,</HI> which is ten or twelve miles further, on the right hand; for which Rea&s;on, in&s;tead of agreeing with one man for the whole Pa&s;&s;age between <HI>Padua</HI> and <HI>Loret|to,</HI> you may make your Bargain to be carried only to <HI>Rimini,</HI> where you may take Hor&s;es for St. <HI>Marin,</HI> and return the &s;ame way back to <HI>Ri|mini,</HI> to continue your Journey. But if you are not &s;ure to find a new pa&s;&s;age at <HI>Rimini</HI> for <HI>Lo|retto,</HI> you may oblige the Per&s;on with whom you agree for your pa&s;&s;age to carry you by the way of St. <HI>Marin.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Loretto,</HI> being eight Per&s;ons in company, we gave twelve <HI>Italian</HI> Pi&s;tols for three Cala&s;hes
<PB N="317" REF="386">
and two Hor&s;es, on condition that we &s;hould arrive at <HI>Rome</HI> on the &s;ixth day. The Hurry of <HI>Loretto</HI> will not give a Traveller time to take exact mea&s;ures for the re&s;t of his Journey, and therefore he mu&s;t depend almo&s;t wholly on his Guide, for the choice of the Way.</P>
<P>You ought not to forget, when you are at <HI>Terni,</HI> to vi&s;it the Ca&s;cade or Waterfal <HI>del Mar|more,</HI> which is but three miles di&s;tant from the Town, tho' tho&s;e who let Hor&s;es thither will tell you 'tis five miles, that they may cheat you of a little Money. You mu&s;t not give above two <HI>Julio's</HI> and a half, or three at mo&s;t, for each Hor&s;e, and you may &s;atisfie the Man who brought you from <HI>Loretto</HI> for the half-day you make him wait at <HI>Terni,</HI> if you did not agree to the contrary at <HI>Loretto.</HI></P>
<P>But, to avoid all this trouble, you may com|prehend that little Journey in the Bargain you make at <HI>Loretto;</HI> and, I advi&s;e you al&s;o to oblige your Guide to carry you to <HI>Mount-Aeolus,</HI> near the little Town of <HI>Ce&s;is,</HI> eight miles from <HI>Terni.</HI> Here you may have the plea&s;ure of viewing a very &s;ingular Rarity; for the Holes and Crevi|ces in this Mountain &s;end forth perpetually, but e&s;pecially in Summer, certain cool Briezes, which the Inhabitants of <HI>Ce&s;is</HI> bring in Pipes to their Cellars and Hou&s;es, to cool their Wines and them&s;elves al&s;o during the great Heats<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> Kircher's Mundus Subter|raneus.</NOTE>; and be&s;ides, they have this Advantage, that they may open the Pipes more or le&s;s, and let out what quantity of Coolne&s;s they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>As you draw near to <HI>Narni,</HI> you may turn a&s;ide to the right hand, to &s;ee the old Bridge
<PB N="318" REF="387">
mention'd in one of my Letters, it will not co&s;t you above half an hour to &s;atisfie your Curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>At our fir&s;t arrival at <HI>Rome</HI> we lodg'd in an Inn, but after our return from <HI>Naples</HI> we took a <HI>Palazzo,</HI> which in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> is no more than a <HI>furni&s;h'd Hou&s;e,</HI> where we were very honourably accommodated for<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>About</HI> 6 l. Sterling.</NOTE> twenty <HI>Pia&s;ters</HI> by the month,</P>
<P>When a Stranger arrives at <HI>Rome,</HI> he is im|mediately pe&s;ter'd with a multitude of Lackeys who come to offer their Service to him, but they are generally a company of treacherous Rogues, who are by no means to be tru&s;ted.</P>
<P>There are two things which a Traveller ought principally to ob&s;erve, with re&s;pect to Servants, when he re&s;olves to encrea&s;e his Train. In the fir&s;t place, he ought to take &s;uch as are of the Country, and even of the place where he re&s;ides at pre&s;ent, for they are acquainted with the Inhabitants and their Cu&s;toms, &s;peak the Language, and are under an Obligation to per|form their Duty better than if they were Stran|gers. Secondly, he ought to receive 'em on the Recommendation of a Friend who knows 'em particularly, and can a&s;&s;ure him of their Fideli|ty; and be&s;ides, he may carry &s;ome &s;pare Coats along with him, that he may put his whole Re|tinue in the &s;ame Livery.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual Wages for Footmen or <HI>Staffieri,</HI> as they are call'd at <HI>Rome,</HI> is two and a half or three <HI>Julio's</HI> by the day; and Servants for the Kitchin may be hir'd at the &s;ame rate.</P>
<P>We gave fourteen Pi&s;tols by the month for a hand&s;om Coach with two good Hor&s;es, tho' in another Sea&s;on we might have had one for
<PB N="319" REF="387">
twelve, and even &s;ometimes for ten; but the greate&s;t concour&s;e of Strangers at <HI>Rome</HI> is in the time of <HI>Lent,</HI> and at <HI>Ea&s;ter,</HI> which enhances the price of many Conveniencies.</P>
<P>They who are at <HI>Rome</HI> in <HI>Lent</HI> may ea&s;ily obtain a permi&s;&s;ion to eat Fle&s;h; and even the Inn-keepers on the Roads will accommodate you with it, but you mu&s;t not ask it too openly, le&s;t you expo&s;e 'em to Cen&s;ure. I have &s;een &s;ome Pa&s;&s;engers quickly &s;atisfie the Scruples of their Landlords, by threatening to go to another Lodging. But generally the <HI>lean</HI> days de&s;erve that name with a witne&s;s almo&s;t every where in <HI>Italy,</HI> and 'tis hardly po&s;&s;ible for a Stranger to accu&s;tom him&s;elf to tho&s;e Severities.</P>
<P>A Traveller who intends not to &s;tay above two or three months at <HI>Rome</HI> &s;hould immediate|ly after his arrival agree with a skilful Antiqua|ry, and fix certain times to vi&s;it with him the principal Rarities of that famous City; for tho' &s;everal Authors have attempted to de&s;cribe 'em, a curious and inqui&s;itive Per&s;on, who examines things upon the &s;pot, and with his own Eyes, will always be able to make &s;ome new Ob&s;erva|tions: and therefore, without con&s;ulting Books, unle&s;s as Helps and Guides, he ought to take a particular view of every thing that is remarka|ble, and &s;et down all that he &s;ees in his Journal; for it happens not unfrequently, that a Travel|ler finds a very con&s;iderable difference between his own Ob&s;ervations and the De&s;criptions of others, when he compares 'em together. And to make his Indu&s;try the more &s;ucce&s;sful, he ought always to carry a Note book about him, and every Evening to examin and tran&s;cribe the
<PB N="320" REF="388">
Ob&s;ervations of the Day; nor will it be impro|per to u&s;e this method every where el&s;e, as well as at <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>To ea&s;e my Memory, and that I might be able on all occa&s;ions to gratifie my Curio&s;ity by an exact enquiry into what was mo&s;t remarka|ble in every City and Country thro' which we pa&s;s'd, I drew up the following Catalogue, which always furni&s;h'd me with a &s;ufficient number of u&s;eful Que&s;tions.</P>

<P><PB N="321" REF="388">D. <HI>Pietro Ro&s;ini</HI> was our Antiquary at <HI>Rome;</HI> he is well acquainted with Medals, and trades in 'em. I think we gave him three Pi&s;tols a month.</P>
<P>'Tis convenient for a Traveller to view the Curio&s;ities of <HI>Rome</HI> in the company of other Strangers; for &s;o his Plea&s;ure is encreas'd by the conver&s;e of his Companions, and many Eyes &s;ee better than one.</P>
<P>No man ought to undertake a Voyage with|out making Provi&s;ion of &s;everal &s;orts of Mea|&s;ures, Geographical Charts, a Watch, Pro&s;pe|ctive-Gla&s;&s;es, a Mariner's Compa&s;s, and Qua|drant. And as far as he is able he ought to take the dimen&s;ions of every thing; in order to which he may ea&s;ily carry along with him a Cane divided into &s;everal Mea&s;ures. And be|&s;ides, I took care to furni&s;h my &s;elf with a piece of Packthread well twin'd and wax'd, fifty fathom long, and divided into feet by Knots, by the help of which I could in a mo|ment mea&s;ure long Di&s;tances, the heighth of Towers, bigne&s;s of Pillars, and what el&s;e I thought fit to ob&s;erve.</P>

<P>A Traveller finds &s;o much Plea&s;ure in con|&s;ulting the Maps of the Countries thro' which he pa&s;&s;es, that he can hardly forbear wi&s;hing he had compleat Setts of all that are extant; there are three things which ought to be ob&s;erv'd on
<PB N="322" REF="389">
this occa&s;ion by tho&s;e who de&s;ign to travel; fir&s;t, they ought not to content them&s;elves with re&s;olving to buy Maps in the Countries whither they intend to go, but make &s;ufficient provi&s;ion of 'em before their departure, and even take &s;ome of all Authors, for we enquir'd for 'em in vain in &s;everal great Cities; and it happens not unfrequently that the lea&s;t e&s;teem'd are upon tryal found to be the mo&s;t exact. Secondly, their Maps ought to be pa&s;ted on Linnen or Canvas, and roll'd up on Sticks. And in the la&s;t place, every judicious and curious Traveller ought to note down all the Errors he perceives in 'em, and communicate his Ob&s;ervations to tho&s;e who make 'em; for, if every ingenious Per&s;on would endeavour to promote &s;o u&s;eful a De&s;ign, in a little time we &s;hould have no rea|&s;on to complain of the Uncorrectne&s;s of Maps.</P>
<P>The Pro&s;pective-Gla&s;&s;es ought to be of &s;e|veral &s;orts, and adapted both to great and &s;mall Di&s;tances; they are u&s;eful for tho&s;e who are de|&s;irous to take a di&s;tinct view of In&s;criptions, Pi|ctures, Statues, Ornaments of Architecture, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>To return to <HI>Rome;</HI> the Curious may fur|ni&s;h them&s;elves with Prints of all its Antiquities, and other remarkable things that are to be &s;een in and about the City, of almo&s;t all which they may have compleat Setts for a hundred Pi&s;tols.</P>
<P>Not only in that City, but every where el&s;e, 'tis convenient for a Traveller to make a Col|lection of &s;uch Prints, which will be of u&s;e to refre&s;h and rectifie his Ideas of the places he has &s;een; and they who are mo&s;t curious may car|ry a skilful De&s;igner along with 'em.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="389">I thought to have &s;ubjoin'd a Catalogue of about Three hundred of the fine&s;t Pictures we &s;aw at <HI>Rome,</HI> but I'm inform'd there is an entire Collection of all tho&s;e Pieces already communi|cated to the Public.</P>
<P>The <HI>Roman</HI> Cala&s;hes are very pretty, and fit for taking the Air in a level Country, but not at all convenient for travelling; in the mean time, &s;ince &s;everal per&s;ons are very fond of 'em, I advi&s;e tho&s;e who de&s;ign to make u&s;e of 'em for a Journey, to take care that they be bound more &s;ecurely with Iron than u&s;ually they are; to chu&s;e &s;uch as are cover'd with Wax'd Cloth ra|ther than with Leather, which grows hard, cracks, and is too heavy; and to place the Body of the Cala&s;h immediately upon the Shafts, in|&s;tead of hanging it, for &s;o it will be le&s;s apt to overturn.</P>
<P>But the be&s;t way is, not to meddle with the&s;e Cala&s;hes, which occa&s;ion &s;o much trouble to tho&s;e who u&s;e 'em; for they mu&s;t buy Hor&s;es, and hire new Servants, both which are &s;ubject to a thou&s;and Accidents, and &s;o many different Cares &s;poil the plea&s;ure of Travelling. And even &s;ometimes the Grooms prick the Hor&s;es Feet in &s;hoeing 'em, when Gentlemen travel on their own Hor&s;es, to oblige 'em either to buy others, or &s;tay till their own are recover'd.</P>
<P>After all, Money makes every thing ea&s;ie, and there is no difficulty &s;o great that may not be ea+&s;ily &s;urmounted by tho&s;e who&s;e Pockets are well lin'd with Gold.</P>
<P>They who happen to be at <HI>Rome</HI> at the time of the arrival of the <HI>Quails,</HI> will do well to leave the City for two or three days, and take a
<PB N="324" REF="390">
Journey towards <HI>O&s;tia</HI> or <HI>Prattica</HI> on the Sea-coa&s;t.</P>
<P>The Journey from <HI>Rome</HI> to <HI>Naples</HI> is u&s;ually perform'd thus: The Travellers hire either Hor&s;es or Cala&s;hes, or both together, that they may have the advantage of ea&s;ing them&s;elves by change. And the Per&s;on with whom they agree at <HI>Rome,</HI> every Pa&s;&s;enger paying <HI>Fifteen Pia&s;ters,</HI> obliges him&s;elf to give 'em eight Meals in their Journey outwards, and as many in their return, to &s;tay five whole days at <HI>Naples,</HI> to pay the Boat at <HI>Cajeta,</HI> to lend his Hor&s;es one day to <HI>Ve&s;uvius,</HI> and another to <HI>Puzzolo,</HI> both which are comprehended in the five to be &s;pent at <HI>Naples.</HI> Thus the whole Journey is perform'd in fifteen days, on the la&s;t of which they return to <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>This way of Travelling is not altogether in|convenient for tho&s;e who are oblig'd to make ha&s;te, but they who are Ma&s;ters of their own time ought to take other mea&s;ures; for a cu|rious Per&s;on may find Employment enough at <HI>Naples</HI> for twelve or fifteen days at lea&s;t, and 'tis almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible in the narrow &s;pace of one day to take a view of all the Antiquities and other Rarities that are to be &s;een about <HI>Puz|zolo,</HI></P>
<P>And therefore they who have lei&s;ure to &s;atisfie their Curio&s;ity, may make u&s;e of the <HI>Procaccio</HI> or ordinary Po&s;t from <HI>Rome</HI> to <HI>Naples,</HI> where they may &s;tay as long as they plea&s;e, and return by the &s;ame way. I could not hear of any Stage-Pa&s;&s;ages, or &s;uch as may be chang'd from time to time, in this part of the Country.</P>
<P>They who chu&s;e the fir&s;t method of perform|ing this Journey are forc'd to return by the &s;ame
<PB N="325" REF="390">
way they came, which cannot but be extream|ly unplea&s;ant to an inqui&s;itive Traveller; but when one is at <HI>Naples,</HI> without any Obligation to make u&s;e of a particular kind of Pa&s;&s;age, he may in his return leave the direct Road, and travel further within the Land on the right &s;ide of it, hiring Hor&s;es from Town to Town. I know &s;ome Per&s;ons who took this way, but 'tis not frequented, and therefore I only give this Advice to tho&s;e who are willing to purcha&s;e the Satisfaction of their Curio&s;ity, and the Plea|&s;ure of Novelty, at the expence of a little Trouble.</P>
<P>At <HI>Naples</HI> we lodg'd at the <HI>Golden Dove,</HI> where we pay'd ten <HI>Carlins</HI> each. The <HI>Dove</HI> and <HI>Three Kings</HI> are the only good Inns in this City. Our Coach co&s;t us no more than twelve <HI>Carlins</HI> a day. At <HI>Rome</HI> you pay but &s;even <HI>Julio's</HI> in the be&s;t Inns, and if you make a Bargain for a con|&s;iderable time, they will content them&s;elves with &s;ix.</P>
<P>They trade much here in Silk Stockins, Ve&s;ts, and other Wor&s;ted Clothes, which are not comparable to tho&s;e that are made at <HI>London.</HI> The Merchants of this place over-rate their Commodities extreamly.</P>
<P>I never heard that there was any Catalogue made of the chief Pictures that are to be &s;een at <HI>Naples;</HI> and therefore, be&s;ides tho&s;e mention'd in my Letters, I &s;hall name &s;ome others for the conveniency of young Painters, who travel in|to <HI>Italy.</HI> I &s;peak only of &s;uch as are in Chur|ches, Convents, or other places, where a Tra|veller may be ea&s;ily admitted to take a view of 'em.</P>

<P>Between <HI>Pavia</HI> and <HI>Milan</HI> you mu&s;t turn a little out of the way, and &s;pend an hour in vi&s;i|ting the Mona&s;tery of the <HI>Chartreux</HI> Fryars.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t pa&s;s the Mountains between <HI>Novi</HI> and <HI>Genoa</HI> on Hor&s;eback; the Rates vary accor|ding to the Sea&s;ons.</P>
<P><PB N="333" REF="394">We gather'd a great deal of Baggage during our Voyage, and the number of our Trunks was encreas'd by one half; but to rid our &s;elves of that Encumbrance, we embark'd the greate&s;t part of 'em at <HI>Genoa.</HI> They who buy a great number of Curio&s;ities will do well to follow our Example: they will find at all the Sea-ports Con&s;uls of their own Nations, who will help 'em to make a &s;ure Bargain with the Ma&s;ters of Ships, and give 'em all manner of a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>At our return from <HI>Genoa</HI> to <HI>Novi</HI> we hir'd a Coach with four Hor&s;es for <HI>Turin,</HI> to go by the way of <HI>Ca&s;al.</HI> At <HI>Turin</HI> we took Hor&s;es for <HI>Ge|neva,</HI> where we hir'd others for <HI>Ba&s;il,</HI> and from thence took fre&s;h Hor&s;es for <HI>Strasburg,</HI> agreeing to pa&s;s by <HI>Hunninghen, Friburg, Bri&s;ack,</HI> and <HI>Sche|le&s;tat.</HI> 'Tis to be ob&s;erv'd that a Traveller &s;aves him&s;elf a great deal of trouble, by making it a part of his Bargain, that his Charge &s;hall be defray'd on the Road. 'Twould be needle&s;s to mention what our pa&s;&s;age thro' the&s;e places co&s;t us, &s;ince the Rates vary perpetually; the length or &s;hortne&s;s of the Days, ea&s;ine&s;s or badne&s;s of the Roads, and greater or le&s;s concour&s;e of Tra|vellers occa&s;ion the&s;e variations.</P>
<P>While you are at <HI>Geneva,</HI> you may hire Hor|&s;es, to &s;ee the fall of the <HI>Rhone,</HI> and at the &s;ame time take a view of the Fort <HI>l'Eclu&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Strasburg</HI> we embark'd on the <HI>Rhine</HI> to <HI>Cologn,</HI> the charge of the pa&s;&s;age is incon&s;ide|rable. There are &s;ome large and well-cover'd Boats, which a Traveller ought to chu&s;e rather than tho&s;e little Wherries, that con&s;i&s;t only of four or five Boards nail'd together. You may embark on the <HI>Rhine</HI> at <HI>Ba&s;il.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="395">We hir'd a whole Coach from <HI>Cologn</HI> to <HI>Bru&s;|&s;els,</HI> where we took another for <HI>Ghent,</HI> and from thence continu'd our Journey to <HI>O&s;tend</HI> by &s;everal Canals; the price of places in the Boats is fix'd, and at <HI>O&s;tend</HI> we hir'd a Coach, that we might arrive the &s;ooner at <HI>Newport,</HI> tho' there is al&s;o a Canal between the&s;e two Cities.</P>
<P>The Boat that pa&s;&s;es between <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> and <HI>Villebroeck</HI> is extreamly commodious: The Pa&s;|&s;engers may be accommodated with Meat and Drink; and in the be&s;t Chamber, call'd the <HI>Roufle,</HI> there is a Chimney, and a little compleat Set of Furniture: You mu&s;t pay &s;omewhat ex|traordinary to be in this Chamber.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the things which I either de&s;crib'd or mention'd in the account of <HI>Antwerp,</HI> Travel|lers may vi&s;it the Abby of St. <HI>Michael,</HI> and e&s;pe|cially the Refectory, and the Pictures in the Abbot's Apartment, the Churches of the <HI>Carme|lites,</HI> St. <HI>James,</HI> and the <HI>Dominicans,</HI> and the Ma|gazines of Tape&s;try.</P>
<P>At <HI>Antwerp</HI> you may be well accommodated at <HI>Laboreur</HI>'s; and in <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> at Sieur <HI>Drou&iuml;n</HI>'s at the Sign of the Golden Fountain.</P>
<P>They who have not the conveniency of a <HI>Yacht</HI> for their pa&s;&s;age to <HI>England,</HI> need not &s;cru|ple to go by the <HI>Pacquet-boat,</HI> which, tho' not &s;o honourable, is both as &s;afe and as good a Sailer as the other.</P>
<P>D. <HI>Antonio de Guevara</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Mondonedo,</HI> and Preacher to <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth, relates, That the application of a Bag of <HI>Saffron</HI> to the Re|gion of the Heart, is an effectua l Remedy again&s;t the Sickne&s;s and Vomiting with which
<PB N="335" REF="395">
tho&s;e that are not<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">I'm inform'd by &s;ome Per&s;ons that they have receiv'd great Benefit on &s;uch occa&s;ions, by applying a Bag &s;tuff'd with grey <HI>Salt</HI> heaten &s;mall, to the Stomack. And others a&s;&s;ure me, That the be&s;t Remedy is, to keep always, night and day, a piece of <HI>Earth</HI> under the No&s;e; for which purpo&s;e they provide a &s;ufficient quantity of Earth, and pre&s;erve it fre&s;h in a Pot of Clay; and when they have us'd a piece &s;o long till it begins to grow dry, they put it in again into the Pot, and take out &s;ome fre&s;h Earth.</NOTE> accu&s;tom'd to the Sea are u&s;ually troubl'd. And he adds, That he try'd the Experiment with very good &s;ucce&s;s, when he follow'd his Ma&s;ter to <HI>Afric,</HI> in his Expedition again&s;t <HI>Tunis.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to give Directions con|cerning the Road that ought to be taken by tho&s;e who de&s;ign to travel to <HI>Italy,</HI> &s;ince the choice of that depends on the place where they intend to enter the Country, and the time they re&s;olve to &s;pend in it. Only, in the general, they ought to con&s;ult the Map, and &s;o to take their Mea&s;ures, that they may &s;ee the la&s;t days of the <HI>Carnaval</HI> at <HI>Venice,</HI> the <HI>Holy Week</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> and the <HI>Octave</HI> of the Sacrament at <HI>Bologna;</HI> to avoid being at <HI>Rome</HI> during the great Heats; to traver&s;e the Country, to &s;ee as much of it as they can; and to endeavour not to pa&s;s twice by the &s;ame way. If they cannot be at <HI>Venice</HI> during the <HI>Carnaval,</HI> they ought at lea&s;t to be there on <HI>A&s;cen&s;ion-day.</HI></P>
<P>It may perhaps be convenient for two or three Strangers to travel in company together; their Fellow&s;hip &s;ometimes makes 'em pa&s;s their hours more cheerfully, and employ the time they be|&s;tow in making Ob&s;ervations with better Succe&s;s and greater Plea&s;ure, e&s;pecially when they are all Men of Probity, and of one Humour.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="396">But the&s;e Societies are obnoxious to the &s;ame Inconveniencies with which Marriage is attend|ed; for when their Humors do not agree, it had been better for 'em they had never come together. Some are curious, de&s;irous to &s;ee and examin every thing with care, and never &s;cruple to expo&s;e them&s;elves to a &s;hower of Rain, or to find their Dinner cold at the Inn, if they can but make &s;ome new Di&s;covery or important Ob&s;ervation: whereas there are others who tra|vel like Po&s;t-hor&s;es, and neither mind In&s;cripti|ons nor Libraries, provided they can find a good Bed at night, and good Victuals when they are hungry. And therefore a prudent Per&s;on ought never to enter into a Society, till he has fir&s;t throughly &s;tudied the Humors of his intended Companions.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, 'tis by no means convenient to travel in Companies in <HI>Italy;</HI> the Inns are &s;o mi&s;erable that oftentimes they can neither accommodate their Gue&s;ts with Meat nor Beds, when they are too numerous.</P>
<P>A Stranger ought always to be furni&s;h'd with &s;ome Iron Machin, to &s;hut his Door on the in&s;ide, which may be ea&s;ily contriv'd, and made of &s;e|veral &s;orts; for it happens not unfrequently, that the Doors of the Lodging-rooms have nei|ther Lock nor Bolt; and 'tis commonly ob&s;erv'd, that <HI>Opportunity makes a Thief.</HI></P>
<P>The Curio&s;ity of a Traveller, e&s;pecially of a young man, who goes to &s;ee the World that he may learn to live in it, &s;hould not be confin'd barely to Enquiries after inanimate Curio&s;ities. They who&s;e Quality can procure 'em admittance in the Courts of Princes, ought never to pa&s;s
<PB N="337" REF="396">
by &s;uch places without vi&s;iting 'em. They ought al&s;o to &s;ee good Company, to enquire af|ter tho&s;e Per&s;ons that are famous for their Skill in Arts and Sciences, and to di&s;cour&s;e with 'em, for 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to receive certain Informati|on of any thing, but from Per&s;ons of that Cha|racter, and their Conver&s;e is in all re&s;pects u&s;e|ful.</P>
<P>To prevent the Inconveniencies of a bad Lodging, they who do not carry a compleat Bed about with 'em ought at lea&s;t to make pro|vi&s;ion of Bed-cloaths and Coverlets. I do not propo&s;e this piece of Caution to comply with the over-nicene&s;s of &s;ome Per&s;ons, but to guard again&s;t the ill con&s;equences of an incommodious Bed, that may be very prejudicial to Health, which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary a Ble&s;&s;ing, that if it were only for the pre&s;ervation of that, a Traveller ought to avoid all manner of Exce&s;s.</P>
<P>To conclude, if we call to mind that a Tra|veller is more obnoxious than other Per&s;ons to Accidents that may di&s;turb the Repo&s;e of his Life, this Reflexion ought to be a new and powerful Motive to engage him not to forget the principal Duties of it.</P>
