<P>_AUgu&s;t 27. 1650. <HI>The Right Honorable Sir</HI> W. Berkly, <HI>Kt. being Governour and Cap|taine Generall of</HI> Virginia, Edw.

<P>This day wee pa&s;&s;ed over a branch belonging to <HI>Blackwater</HI> lake, running South ea&s;t into <HI>Chawan</HI> River; at that place wee were forced to unlade our Carria|ges by rea&s;on of the great raines lately fallen, which otherwi&s;e is very pa&s;&s;able for foot, being firm gravelly ground in the bottome, and lieth from Fort <HI>Henry</HI> 20. miles, and &s;ome 12. miles from this place we travelled unto a deepe River called the <HI>Nottaway</HI> Creeke &s;ome 100. paces over &s;andy bottomes (&amp; with a little labour may be made pa&s;&s;eable) unto a <HI>Nottaway</HI> Town liyng &s;ome two miles from the River. Hither we came within night, and by rea&s;on of our &s;uddaine approach and hallowing of <HI>Robert Farmer</HI> &s;ervant to Mr. <HI>Bland,</HI> the Inhabitants ran all away into the Woods, with their Women and Children; therefore by us it was named <HI>Farmers</HI> Cha&s;e. After our arrivall there with|in a &s;mall &s;pace of time one <HI>Indian</HI> man appeared, and finding of us peaceable, and the white flag bore be|fore us by our Guide whom they knew, he made a
<PB N="2" REF="6">
hallow and the re&s;t came in from their &s;culking holes like &s;o many timerous Hares, and &s;hewed us what curte&s;ie they could. About two houres after came to us <HI>Oyeocker</HI> elder brother to <HI>Chounterounte</HI> one of the <HI>Nottaway</HI> Kings, who told us that his brother <HI>Chounte|rounte,</HI> and other of the <HI>Nottaway</HI> Kings would come to us next day by Noone, and that the day before <HI>Chounterounte</HI> and all his men had been a hunting, and it hapned that <HI>Chounterounte</HI> had &s;hot one of his bro|thers in the leg, and that thereupon he was gone downewards. We &s;tayed untill next day at Noone but he came not, and then we journyed unto the Towne belonging unto <HI>Oyeocker,</HI> who kindly invited us thither, and told us he thought that <HI>Chounterounte</HI> would meet us there, and al&s;o of his owne accord proffered us to be our guide whither&s;oever we went. The Land generally to this Towne is Champion, ve|ry rich, and the Towne &s;cituate in a rich levell, well timbered, watered, and very convenient for Hogs and Cattle.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 28.

<PB N="3" REF="6">
or pentater with &s;mall Boats, and &s;ome two miles higher there is a &s;ound pa&s;&s;age no deeper then a mans anckle: Within night came <HI>Chounterounte</HI> unto our Quarters frowning, and with a countenance noting much di&s;content, downe he &s;ets, and lookes about him, &s;alutes the Engli&s;h with a &s;cornefull po&s;ture, and then our Appamattack Guide, and tels him, I am &s;orry for thee friend, thou wilt be knockt on the head; after this &s;ome pau&s;e was made before any di&s;cour&s;e, expecting the Engli&s;h would begin, but finding us &s;low, he thus &s;pake: There was a <HI>Wainoake Indian</HI> told him that there was an Engli&s;hman a <HI>Cockarous</HI> hard by Captaine <HI>Floods,</HI> gave this Indian Bells, and other petty truck to lay downe to the <HI>Tus|karood</HI> King, and would have hired him to have gone with him, but the <HI>Wainoakes</HI> being doubtfull what to doe, went to Captaine <HI>Flood</HI> for advice, who advi&s;ed them not to go, for that the Governour would give no licence to go thither; heereupon <HI>Chounterounte</HI> was by us que&s;tioned, when and who it was that had told him &s;o, &amp; if he did know that <HI>Wainoake</HI> Indian, to which he an&s;wered doubtfully, and demanded of us whither we did intend to go; we told him the <HI>Tuska|rood</HI> King had envited us to trade, and our Governour had ordered us to go, and &s;peake with an Engli&s;hman among&s;t them, and to enquire for an Engli&s;h woman ca&s;t away long &s;ince, and was among&s;t tho&s;e Nations. <HI>Chounterounte</HI> per&s;waded us to go no further, alleadg|ing there was no Engli&s;h there, that the way was long, for pa&s;&s;age very bad by rea&s;on of much raine that had lately fallen, and many rotten Marri&s;hes and Swampps there was to pa&s;&s;e over, <HI>in fine</HI> we
<PB N="4" REF="7">
found him, and all his men very unwilling we &s;hould go any further; but we told them, that let the waies and pa&s;&s;ages be never &s;o bad, we were re&s;olved to go through, and that we were not afraid of him nor his Nation, nor any other, for we intended no injury, and that we mu&s;t go, for we were commanded by our King; the&s;e words cau&s;ed <HI>Chounterounte</HI> to a&s;&s;imulate a feare in his countenance, and after delivery of him|&s;elfe, at our going away next day, when we had moun|ted our Hor&s;es, <HI>Chounterounte</HI> came privately unto us, and in a mo&s;t &s;erious manner intimating unto us, that he loved us, and our Nation, and that he lively ap|prehended our danger, and that our &s;afety concerned him, for if any accident hapned otherwi&s;e then good to us, he &s;hould be &s;u&s;pected to have a hand in it, and withall wi&s;hed us to go no further, for that he cer|tainly knew that the Nations we were to go through would make us away by treachery; we an&s;wered him, that we were not afraid to be killed, for that any one of us were able to deale with forty through the pro|tection of our great God, for we were commanded by our King.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 29. We travelled from this &s;econd Town to <HI>Maharineck,</HI> eight miles upon barren Champion Lands, and &s;ix miles further is a branch that runnes South we&s;t, with rich Lands upon it; and from thence &s;ome &s;ixe miles further, is a Brooke &s;ome hundred paces over, and runnes South and a little to the We&s;t, on both &s;ides of the Creek: for fowre miles or there|abouts, is very rich Lands, well Timbered and Wate|red, and large dry Meadowes, South and by We&s;t: From this Creeke is another, &s;ome eight miles off,

that opens it &s;elfe into divers &s;mall Guts, made by the inundation of Fre&s;hes of Waters; and the pa&s;|&s;age lies &s;ome two hundred paces from the Path, and this Creek is &s;ome ten miles from <HI>Maharinecke</HI> Towne, and was by us named <HI>Newcombs Forre&s;t.</HI> It was night when we entred into <HI>Maharineck,</HI> where we found a Hou&s;e ready made for us of Matts; and Corne &s;talkes layd in &s;everall places for our Hor&s;es, the Inhabitants &s;tanding, according to their cu&s;tome, to greet us: and after &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e with their <HI>Wer|rowance,</HI> a Youth, to whom wee pre&s;ented &s;everall gifts, we certified them the cau&s;e of our comming was to Trade in way of friend&s;hip, and de&s;ired the great men that what Wares or Skins the Town did afford, might be brought to our Quarters next mor|ning; and al&s;o a mea&s;ure for <HI>Roanoak,</HI> which they promi&s;ed &s;hould be done, and &s;o left us to our &s;elves a while, untill wee had refre&s;hed our &s;elves with &s;uch provi&s;ions as they had &s;et before us, in mo&s;t plenti|full maner; and afterwards the great men and Inha+bitants came, and performed divers Ceremonies, and Dancings before us, as they u&s;e to doe to their grea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> Emperour <HI>Apachancano,</HI> when they entertain him in mo&s;t &s;olemne maner and friend&s;hip.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 30. Being wearied with our la&s;t dayes tra|vell, we continued at <HI>Maharineck,</HI> and this day &s;pake with a Tuskarood Indian, who told us that the Eng|li&s;hman was a great way off at the further Tuskarood Towne, and wee hired this Turkarood Indian to run before, and tell his <HI>Werrowance</HI> wee intended to lay him downe a pre&s;ent at <HI>Hocomowananck,</HI> and de&s;ired to have him meete us there, and al&s;o wrote to that

effect to the Engli&s;hman in Engli&s;h, Latine, Spani&s;h, French and Dutch, the <HI>Tuskarood</HI> promi&s;ed in three dayes to meete us at <HI>Hocomawananck.</HI> In the after|noone came two Indians to our Quarters, one of whom the <HI>Maharinecks</HI> told us was the <HI>Werrowance</HI> of <HI>Hocomawananck</HI> River, &s;eemed very joyfull that wee could goe thither, and told us the <HI>Tuskarood</HI> would have come to us to trade, but that the <HI>Wainoakes</HI> had &s;poken much to di&s;hearten them from having any trade with the Engli&s;h, and that they intended divers times to have come in, but were afraid, for the <HI>Wai|noakes</HI> had told them that the Engli&s;h would kill them, or detaine them, and would not let them goe without a great heape of <HI>Roanoake</HI> middle high, to which we an&s;wered that the <HI>Wainoakes</HI> dur&s;t nor af|firme any &s;uch thing to our faces, and that they had likewi&s;e &s;poken much again&s;t the <HI>Tuskarood</HI> to the Engli&s;h, it being a common thing among&s;t them to villefie one another, and tell nothing but lies to the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>This day in the morning the <HI>Maharineck</HI> great men &s;pake to heare &s;ome of our guns go off: Whereupon we &s;hot two guns at a &s;mall marke, both hitting it, and at &s;o great a di&s;tance of a hundred paces, or more, that the Indians admired at it: And a little before night the old King of <HI>Maharineck</HI> came to us, and told us, that the people in the Towne were afraid when the guns went off, and ran all away into the Woods. This night al&s;o we had much Dancing.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 31. Wee went away from <HI>Maharineck</HI> South Ea&s;t two miles to goe over <HI>Maharineck</HI> River, which hath a bottome betweene two high land &s;ides
<PB N="7" REF="8" MS="y">
through which you mu&s;t pa&s;&s;e to get over, which River is about two hundred paces broad, and hath a high water marke after a fre&s;h of at lea&s;t twenty foot perpendicular by the trees in the breaches be|tweene the River, and the high land of the old fields. This River is the Southerly la&s;t and maine branch of <HI>Chawan</HI> River, and was by us named <HI>Woodford</HI> River, and runs to the Ea&s;tward of the South. On both &s;ides of <HI>Woodford</HI> River is very much exceeding rich Land, but e&s;pecially on the further &s;ide towards <HI>Ho|comawananck.</HI> Imediately after the pa&s;&s;age over this River, are old Indian fields of exceeding rich Land, that beare two Crops of Indian Corne a yeare, and hath timber trees above five foot over, who&s;e truncks are a hundred foot in cleare timber, which will make twenty Cuts of Board timber a piece, and of the&s;e there is abundance.</P>
<P>As al&s;o exceeding rich Land, full of great Reeds thrice as big as the large&s;t Arrow Reeds we have a|bout our Plantations; this good Land continues for &s;ome &s;ix miles together unto a great Swampp, and then begins a pyny barren Champion Land with di|vers Branches and Peco&s;ans, yet very pa&s;&s;eable, run|ning South and by We&s;t, unto a deepe River &s;ome a hundred paces over, running South, and a little to the Ea&s;t, which River inclo&s;es a &s;mall I&s;land which wee named <HI>Brew&s;ters</HI> I&s;land, &s;ome eighteene miles from <HI>Woodford</HI> River due South, and by We&s;t, with very ex|ceeding rich Land on both &s;ides of it for &s;ome &s;ixe miles together, and this River we al&s;o named <HI>Brew|&s;ters</HI> River, it being the fir&s;t branch of <HI>Hocomawananck</HI> River: and a little lower downe as the River runs, is
<PB N="8" REF="9">
&s;uch another River as <HI>Chickahamine</HI> River (which is a mile broad.)</P>
<P>After we had pa&s;&s;ed over this River we travelled &s;ome twenty miles further upon a pyny barren Champion Land to <HI>Hocomawananck</HI> River, South, and by We&s;t: &s;ome twelve miles from <HI>Brew&s;ters</HI> River we came unto a path running cro&s;&s;e &s;ome twenty yards on each &s;ide unto two remarkeable Trees; at this path our Appamattuck Guide made a &s;top, and cleared the We&s;terly end of the path with his foote, being demanded the meaning of it, he &s;hewed an un|willingne&s;&s;e to relate it, &s;ighing very much: Where|upon we made a &s;top untill <HI>Oyeocker</HI> our other Guide came up, and then our Appamattuck Guide journied on; but <HI>Oyeocker</HI> at his comming up cleared the o|ther end of the path, and prepared him&s;elfe in a mo&s;t &s;erious manner to require our attentions, and told us that many yeares &s;ince their late great Emperour <HI>Appachancano</HI> came thither to make a War upon the <HI>Tuskarood,</HI> in revenge of three of his men killed, and one wounded, who e&s;caped, and brought him word of the other three murthered by the <HI>Hocomawananck</HI> Indians for lucre of the <HI>Roanoake</HI> they brought with them to trade for Otter skins. There accompanyed <HI>Appachancano</HI> &s;everall petty Kings that were under him, among&s;t which there was one King of a Towne called <HI>Pawhatan,</HI> which had long time harboured a grudge again&s;t the King of <HI>Chawan,</HI> about a yong wo|man that the King of <HI>Chawan</HI> had detayned of the King of <HI>Pawhatan:</HI> Now it hapned that the King of <HI>Chawan</HI> was invited by the King of <HI>Pawhatan</HI> to this place under pretence to pre&s;ent him with a Guift of
<PB N="9" REF="9">
&s;ome great vallew, and there they met accordingly, and the King of <HI>Pawhatan</HI> went to &s;alute and embrace the King of <HI>Chawan,</HI> and &s;troaking of him after their u&s;uall manner, he whipt a bow &s;tring about the King of <HI>Chawans</HI> neck, and &s;trangled him; and how that in memoriall of this, the path is continued unto this day, and the friends of the <HI>Pawhatans</HI> when they pa&s;&s;e that way, clean&s;e the We&s;terly end of the path, and the friends of the <HI>Chawans</HI> the other. And &s;ome two miles from this path we came unto an Indian Grave upon the Ea&s;t &s;ide of the path: Upon which Grave there lay a great heape of &s;ticks covered with greene boughs, we demanded the rea&s;on of it, <HI>Oyeoc|ker</HI> told us, that there lay a great man of the <HI>Chawans</HI> that dyed in the &s;ame quarrell, and in honour of his maemory they continue greene boughs over his Grave to this day, and ever when they goe forth to Warre they relate his, and others valorous, loyall Acts, to their yong men, to annimate them to doe the like when occa&s;ion requires. Some foure miles from <HI>Ho|comawananck</HI> is very rich Champian Land: It was night when we came to <HI>Hocomawananck</HI> River, and the Indian that came with us from <HI>Woodford</HI> River, and belonged to <HI>Hocomawananck,</HI> would have had us quar|tered upon the &s;ide of a great Swampp that had the advantage of &s;everall bottomes of the Swampp on both &s;ides of us, but we removed to take our advan|tage for &s;afety, and retreate, in ca&s;e any accident &s;hould happen, which at that time promi&s;ed nothing but danger, for our Guides began to be doubtfull, and told us, that the <HI>Hocomawananck</HI> Indians were very treacherous, and that they did not like their counte|nances,

and &s;hape well; this place we named <HI>Py|anchas</HI> Parke: about three houres after we had taken up our Quarters, &s;ome of the Inhabitants came, and brought us roa&s;ting cares, and Sturgeon, and the <HI>Ho|comawananck</HI> Indian that came with us from <HI>Woodford</HI> River, came not unto us untill next day, but his <HI>War|rowance</HI> told us before wee came from <HI>Woodford,</HI> hee could not come untill that day at night. The next day morning after our comming to <HI>Hocomawananck</HI> the In|habitants &s;eemed to prepare us a hou&s;e: But we a|bout eight of the clock &s;et forward to goe view the place where they killed Sturgeon, which was &s;ome &s;ix miles from the place where we quartered by <HI>Pyan|chas</HI> Parke, where there is a River Running very deep South, exceeding deepe, and foure hundred paces broad. The high water marke of this River between both &s;ides of the River perpendicular, from the top of the Banck to the River, is forty five foot upon a fre&s;h; this River was by us named <HI>Blandina</HI> River: from <HI>Py|anchas</HI> Parke to the place where they kill Sturgeon is &s;ix miles up the River running Northerly, and all ex|ceeding rich Land: Both upwards and downewards upon the River, at this place where they kill Sturge|on al&s;o are the Falls, and at the foot of the&s;e Falls al|&s;o lies two I&s;lands in a great Bay, the uppermo&s;t whereof Mr. <HI>Blande</HI> named <HI>Charles</HI> I&s;land, and the lowermo&s;t Captaine <HI>Wood</HI> named <HI>Berkeley</HI> I&s;land: on the further &s;ide of the&s;e I&s;lands the Bay runs naviga|ble by the two I&s;lands &s;ides: <HI>Charles</HI> I&s;land is three miles broad, and foure miles long, and <HI>Berkeley</HI> I&s;land almo&s;t as big, both in a manner impregnable, by na|ture being fortified with high Clefts of Rocky Stone,

The Land over again&s;t <HI>Charles</HI> I&s;land we named <HI>Blands</HI> Di&s;covery, and the Land over again&s;t <HI>Berkeley</HI> I&s;land we named <HI>Woods</HI> journy, and at the lower end of <HI>Charles</HI> I&s;land lies a Bay due South from the &s;aid I&s;land, &s;o &s;patious that we could not &s;ee the other &s;ide of it: this bay we name|ed <HI>Pennants</HI> Bay, and in the River between <HI>Charles</HI> I|&s;land, and the maine Land lies a Rocky Point in the River, which Point comes out of <HI>Charles</HI> I&s;land, and runs into the middle of the River: this Point we name|ed <HI>Brew&s;ters</HI> Point, and at this Point only, and no o|ther is there any place pa&s;&s;eable into <HI>Charles</HI> I&s;land, and this <HI>Brew&s;ters</HI> Point runs not quite from <HI>Charles</HI> I&s;land to the maine Land, but when you come off the maine Land to the Rivers &s;ide, you mu&s;t wade about fifty paces to come upon the Point, and if you mi&s;&s;e the Point on either &s;ide, up or downe the River, you mu&s;t &s;wim, and the River runs very &s;wift.

At <HI>Blandina</HI> River we had &s;ome di&s;|cour&s;e with our Appamattuck Guide concerning that River, who told us that that Branch of <HI>Blandina</HI> River ran a great way up into the Country; and that about three dayes journy further to the South-We&s;t, there was a far greater Branch &s;o broad that a man could hardly &s;ee over it, and bended it &s;elfe to the North|ward above the head of <HI>James</HI> River, unto the foot of the great Mountaines, on which River there lived many people upwards, being the <HI>Occonacheans</HI> and the <HI>Ne&s;&s;oneicks,</HI> and that where &s;ome of the <HI>Occonacheans</HI>

<P><HI>September</HI> 1. About noone from Woods Journey wee travelled &s;ome &s;ixe miles North Ea&s;t, unto the old Path that leads to <HI>Brew&s;ters</HI> River: within night we quartered on the other &s;ide of it, and kept good watch: this Path runnes from Woods Journey north and by Ea&s;t, and due North.</P>

This day about Noone we came to <HI>Woodford</HI> River Towne, and tarried there that night, we found the old <HI>Werrowance,</HI> and all his great men gone, yet had courteous quarter; but not without great grounds of &s;u&s;pition, and &s;ignes that they were angry at us: at our coming back to <HI>Woodford</HI> River we had informa|tion that &s;ome Spies of <HI>Wainoake</HI> had been there a lit|tle before we came, and that the King of <HI>Wainoake</HI> and <HI>Chounterounte</HI> had &s;ent Runners to all the Nations thereabouts, informing them that the Engli&s;h were come to cut them off, which we &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;ome greater Polititians then Indian Con&s;ultations, who had &s;ome private ends to them&s;elves, and minded no|thing le&s;&s;e then a publick good; for we found that the Runner whom we imployed to carry our me&s;&s;age to

<P><HI>September</HI> 3. By breake of day we journied from <HI>Woodford</HI> River to a path &s;ome eight miles above <HI>Pen|nants</HI> Mount running North, and by Ea&s;t and North, North, Ea&s;t, which was done by the advice of our Appamattuck Guide, who told us that he was infor|med that &s;ome plots might be acted again&s;t us, if we returned the way that we came, for we told <HI>Chounte|rounte</HI> we would returne the &s;ame way againe: And this information our Guide told us he had from a wo|man that was his Sweet-heart belonging to <HI>Woodford</HI> River. This day we pa&s;&s;ed over very much rich, red, fat, marle Land, betweene <HI>Woodford</HI> River Towne, and the head of <HI>Pennants</HI> Mount, with divers Indian fields; the head of which River abounds much with great Rocks of Stone, and is two hundred paces over, and hath a &s;mall I&s;land in it named <HI>Sackfords</HI> I&s;land. Betweene <HI>Pennants</HI> Mount River head, and the head of <HI>Farmers</HI> Cha&s;e River is very much exceeding rich, red, fat, marle Land, and <HI>Nottaway</HI> and <HI>Schockoores</HI> old fields, for a matter of &s;ixe miles together all the trees are blowne up or dead: Heere it began to raine, and &s;ome &s;ix miles further we tooke up our quarters, and it proved a very wet night. At the fir&s;t other <HI>Notta|way</HI> old fields, we found the Inhabitants much per|plexed about a gun that went off to the We&s;tward of them, the night before wee came thither, which

About 8 of the Clock we travelled North, North-Ea&s;t &s;ome &s;ix miles, unto the head of Farmers Cha&s;e River, where we were forced to &s;wimm our hor&s;es over, by rea&s;on of the great rain that fell that night, which otherwi&s;e with a little labour may be made very pa&s;&s;able. At this place is very great Rocky &s;tones, fit to make Mill-&s;tones with very rich tracks of Land, and in &s;ome places between the head of Farmers Cha&s;e River and Black water Lake, is ground that gives very probable proofe of an Iron, or &s;ome other rich Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">e.
