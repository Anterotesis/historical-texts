<HEAD>A TRVE DISCOVRSE, WHEREIN IS &s;et downe the wonderfull mercy of God, &s;hewed to|wardes the Chri&s;tians, on the two and twentie of Iune. 1593. again&s;t the Turke, before Sy&s;&s;ek in Croatia.</HEAD>
<P>_VPon the 14. day of Iune, that Chri|&s;tian enemie, and Common violator of peace <HI>Ha&s;&s;am Ba&s;&s;a</HI> of <HI>Bo&s;&s;na,</HI> with the re&s;t of his Lordes and &s;ouldiers, to the nomber of thyrtie eight thou|&s;and and two hundred, &s;urpri&s;ed the ca&s;tle and towre of <HI>Trent&s;china,</HI> &s;om|times belonging to the Bi&s;hopricke of <HI>Agram.</HI></P>
<P>From thence, vppon the 15. following, he marched before <HI>Sy&s;&s;ek,</HI> and played vpon it with his artillerie, vntill the eightenth day, with &s;uch force, that he ouer|threw euen to the ground, the towre thereof, and two peeces of ordinance, together with the ma&s;ter gunners which were appointed, for among &s;uch field peeces as he there v&s;ed, he had three in chief, which &s;hot bollets of fortie, four and fortie, &amp; fiue and fortie pound weight.</P>
<P>Vpon this the borderers of the Empire, drawen thereunto partly by nece&s;&s;itie, and partly through de|&s;ire to relieue <HI>Sy&s;&s;ek</HI> afore&s;aid, a&s;&s;embled their forces together ouer again&s;t <HI>Agram</HI> as namely <HI>Rupertus</HI> Ba|ron of <HI>Eckhenberg</HI> generall of the field: <HI>Andrea Awer|&s;perg</HI> chief commander in <HI>Croatia: Erdody Baan</HI> Lord of <HI>Carl&s;tat</HI> in <HI>Windi&s;marke,</HI> the Lord of <HI>Gra&s;wein,</HI> Co|ronell of the hor&s;emen of <HI>Styria</HI> and <HI>Carniola,</HI> and <HI>Mel|chior</HI>

<P>Vpon the ninetenth following, the Turks a&s;&s;aulted it: but effectuated nothing, onely they lo&s;t &s;ome three &s;core Turkes: at which in&s;tant, our men behaued them&s;elues manfully.</P>
<P>Vpon the 20. day <HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI> &s;ent out three hundred men, to &s;ee if they could intercept any per&s;on, by whom they might be enformed of the &s;tate of our Campe: again&s;t whom the Baron of <HI>Ecke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">berg</HI> made out &s;ome foure hundred hor&s;es, who pre&s;e~tly put the Turkes to flight, of whom, they &s;lewe &s;ome, &s;ome other were take~ pri&s;o|ners, and brought home about &s;ome fortie hor&s;e.</P>
<P>Vpon the 21. day, there i&s;&s;ued out agayne on th'other &s;ide of the water, &s;ome foure hundred of the enemy, likewi&s;e to learne and harken of our precee|dings, who were in like manner beaten backe, and for|ced to retire to their Campe.</P>
<P>Who becau&s;e they could not pa&s;&s;e the water, with conuenient &s;peede, lo&s;t many of their companie, <HI>viz:</HI> two &s;hippefulls in the water, which were drowned, at which time our men tooke two en&s;eignes, and one <HI>Agga,</HI> or Coronell, (who had the leading of &s;euen en|&s;eignes).</P>
<P>Vpon the two and twentith of Iune, our men mar|ched

But the Baron of <HI>Eckenberg,</HI> with certaine other of the Lordes and Chiefe Commaunders, were of a contrary adui&s;e, and thought it more conuenient (in Gods name) to try the fortune of the Battaile, e&s;pecially, becau&s;e the ne|ce&s;&s;itie vrged, &amp; they of <HI>Sy&s;&s;ek</HI> were not able one howre lo~ger to endure the &s;iege. Be&s;ides, it was to be feared, le&s;t th'enemy, in making their retraicte, would vn|doubtedly &s;et vpon them. Which adui&s;e allowed and approued of the re&s;t, they put them&s;elues in order of battaile. The enemy did the like. And as <HI>Ha&s;&s;am Ba&s;&s;a</HI> of <HI>Bo&s;sna</HI> made head again&s;t our men, with &s;ome ten thou&s;and hor&s;e and more, and was now entred the I&s;|land and brought all his Ruitters before <HI>Sy&s;sek,</HI> he cau|&s;ed his Turki&s;h footemen to be placed vpon th'other &s;ide of the Riuer (where a bridge was made of &s;hippes) and the greater part of the Armie kept it &s;elfe clo&s;e in a Troupe.</P>
<P>The fight began about eleue~ or twelue of the clock: And the L. <HI>Baan</HI> with his <HI>Hungarians,</HI> and the people of <HI>Windi&s;marke</HI> gaue the fir&s;t a&s;&s;ault: who through the force and multitude of th'enemy, and namely of the <HI>Ianizaries,</HI> who were placed next the riuer, i&s;&s;ued out vpon them &s;o forcibly, that they were fayne to retire, who neuerthele&s;&s;e were re&s;cued and relieued by the Lord <HI>Graffen</HI> of <HI>Monte Kukulle,</HI> and the harquebu&s;i|ers of <HI>Carniola.</HI></P>
<PB N="4" REF="4">
<P>Vpon th'other &s;ide the <HI>Koppreunitzers,</HI> they of <HI>Carle|&s;tat,</HI> the <HI>Stirians,</HI> and <HI>Carniolans,</HI> to the number of three hundred hor&s;e, brake vpon th'enemy: emong&s;t whom was the L. Generall of <HI>Eckenberg,</HI> with the Lordes of <HI>Roderne</HI> and <HI>Sile&s;ian</HI> Ruitters, and the Cheefe Com|maunders of the hor&s;e, who likewi&s;e made their fight.</P>
<P>Now as &s;one as the Turkes e&s;pied them, and found them by their manner of riding, to be of <HI>Carl&s;tat,</HI> High Almaines, and of the Confines (for they were at the fir&s;t per&s;uaded, that they had beene, as in times pa&s;t, but Boures and Pe&s;ants) they tooke their flight to|wardes the Bridge, right ouer again&s;t their Leaguer on the other &s;ide of the Riuer of <HI>Kulpa:</HI> among&s;t whom our people brake in with a great fury. As &s;oone as the <HI>Ha&s;&s;am Ba&s;&s;a</HI> e&s;pied this he ran in all ha&s;t to the Bridge made vpon the Riuer <HI>Kulpa,</HI> hoping there to make his people (who were now in Flight) pre&s;ently to retourne to the Fight, but all in vaine: for there were about two En&s;ignes, or fiue hundred Turkes, which had allrea|dy pa&s;t the Bridge, vnto the Footemen there, and the re&s;t endeuoured to follow with all their might and maine: who were intercepted by them of <HI>Carl&s;tat</HI> and the <HI>Koppreunitzers,</HI> &amp; forced them to leaue the Bridge: And the Turkes, which were on the other &s;hoare, la|bored in the meane while to breake down the Bridge, whome our people with their &s;hott forced to retire.</P>
<P>When the Turkes perceiued, that the Bridge was taken from them, they tooke the water, which at that tyme was great, and ranne &s;o &s;till, as if it had bene a &s;tanding lake. In which many a &s;tately, worthy and renowned Turke and hor&s;e, lo&s;t his lyfe; for they no &s;ooner entred it, but were pre&s;ently drowned.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="4">
<P>Of all the&s;e Turkes, very fewe or none e&s;caped the water, by rea&s;on of the &s;hot which continually plaid vpon them, all that day and night.</P>
<P><HI>Ha&s;&s;am Ba&s;&s;a</HI> of <HI>Bo&s;&s;na,</HI> him &s;elfe with certayne o|ther <HI>Beegen, Aggen, Spahyen, Sayen,</HI> al&s;o other renow|ned Turkes, were forced to take the water euen vn|der <HI>Sy&s;&s;ek,</HI> and were there drowned.</P>
<P>The high Almains would not take any Turke pri|&s;oner, but &s;lewe them all: but they of <HI>Winde&s;marke,</HI> tooke &s;ome and brought them from thence.</P>
<P>The Turkes which were on thother &s;yde of the wa|ter greatly lamented, and entreated that if their <HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI> were taken pri&s;oner, they would not touch his life, but rather honorably entertaine him, for their Emperour would a&s;&s;uredly ran&s;ome him.</P>
<P>The Turki&s;h Emperoures &s;i&s;ters &s;onne, called <HI>Me|hemet Beeg,</HI> &s;tretched forth his hand in the water (cra|uinge as it were to be relieued) but he was pre&s;ently &s;layne with a &s;hott.</P>
<P>The bodyes of <HI>Ba&s;&s;a, Ernot Beeg: Rhu&s;tan Beeg: and Mehemet Beeg:</HI> who was cheefe Generall of the Tur|ki&s;h Cauallerie, were taken out of the water, and the &s;aid <HI>Mehemet</HI> had his head pre&s;ently &s;trooke of.</P>
<P>The Almaine footemen, &amp; &s;uch as were vnder the conduct and leading of <HI>Ferdinand Werdners,</HI> were not pre&s;ent at this encounter: but were left behinde to guarde th'Artillery: who forced th'ennemie to leaue eight Field peeces vpon carriages (which were vnder the charge of the <HI>Kazianerins,</HI> and taken from vs by th'ennemy <HI>Anno</HI> 33. before <HI>E&s;&s;ek</HI>) and al&s;o certaine f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> conetes, with thirty &s;hippes of Victual: they tooke &s;poyle likewi&s;e of the whole Campe and riffled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">
