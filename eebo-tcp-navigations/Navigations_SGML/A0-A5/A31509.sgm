<HEAD><HI>Certain Propo&s;itions</HI> Relating to the <HI>Scots</HI> Plantation of <HI>CALEDONIA,</HI> and the National Addre&s;s for &s;upporting thereof, breifly offered to Publick View, for removing of Mistakes and Prejudices.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. THAT the <HI>Scotch</HI> Planters have entered upon <HI>Caledonia</HI> by Warrant, and un|der Security of an Act of Parliament, and Letters patent from his Maje&s;ty under the Great Seal, and mo&s;t &s;trictly within the Terms and Conditions thereof; otherwi&s;e there had needed no more to Ruine them, than a De|claration of their having Forfeited their Act and Charter.</P>
<P N="2">II. That their Right is confirmed by Invitation from, and League with the original free Natives of that Country, who only can have the primary Natural Right to the Soil, and from whom the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have, contrary to all Ju&s;tice, Faith, and Contract, u|&s;urp'd what they now pro&s;&s;e&s;s in <HI>America,</HI> having obtain'd their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by Fraud and Force and Barbarous Cruelty, and by the Popes Donation upon certain Condi|tions, which they have not in the lea&s;t ob&s;erved, as is fully made appear by <HI>Bartholo|mew de las Ca&s;as</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Chiapa,</HI> one of there own Mi&s;&s;ionaries.</P>
<P N="3">III. That the place cho&s;en by the <HI>Scots</HI> was never inhabited by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> or any other <HI>European,</HI> and con&s;equently the <HI>Scots</HI> have the &s;ame freedom to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to po&s;&s;e&s;s any part of the Coa&s;t from <HI>New-England</HI> to <HI>Florida,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> in <HI>Canada</HI> and <HI>Me&s;&s;a&s;ippy,</HI> the <HI>Portuguez</HI> in <HI>Bra&s;il,</HI> and the <HI>Dutch</HI> in <HI>Suranam,</HI> being all upon the &s;ame Continent, which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> from <HI>Columbus's</HI> di&s;covery, do chal|lenge to them&s;elves. And indeed it is evident, That the Crown and Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> hath not a better Title, nor a more ju&s;t Right to any <HI>Scots</HI> Territory from the <HI>Mule</HI> of <HI>Galloway</HI> to the <HI>Week</HI> of <HI>Cathnes</HI> then to <HI>Caledonia</HI> in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. That not only have the <HI>Scots</HI> the &s;ole unque&s;tionable Right to this Important Place: But likewi&s;e, albeit they have been hitherto debarr'd from all Benefit of free Trading in other Plantations, yet they have very frankly offered both to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> their Prote&s;tant Neighbours, a rea&s;onable Share in all the Advantages of <HI>Caledonia,</HI> which for Natural Wealth and Strength, and conveniency of Trading, is without Di&s;pute, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable in the whole World.</P>
<P N="5">V. That if the <HI>Scots</HI> be forced to abandon their Plantation, the <HI>French</HI> will undoubt|edly &s;eize upon it, not only for the &s;ake of Trade, Gain, and Empire; But likewi&s;e in Zeal for rooting out the Northern Here&s;y, both from <HI>America</HI> and <HI>Europe,</HI> which may be ea&s;ily fore&s;een, both by the va&s;t occa&s;ion of Power and Wealth, that &s;o impor|rant a Po&s;t will bring to the <HI>French</HI> Greatne&s;s, and by the keen Re&s;entment that all the Popi&s;h Courts, and particularly the Court of <HI>Rome</HI> have te&s;tified again&s;t the <HI>Scots</HI> po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing thereof, and by the no le&s;s unpolitick than cruel Per&s;ecution that, at this day rages in <HI>France</HI> again&s;t the poor Remnant of Prote&s;tants, who cannot comply with their Super&s;tition and Idolatry.</P>
<P N="6">VI. That there is &s;uch an hopeful appearance of propagating the pure Go&s;pel a|mong&s;t an Harmle&s;s, good Natur'd People in the Neighbourhood of <HI>Caledonia,</HI> who &s;eem well di&s;po&s;ed to receive it, as ought to excite Reformed Prote&s;tants to contri|bute thereto with the greate&s;t Vigor; and to &s;trengthen them&s;elves again&s;t the Ro|mi&s;h Power; e&s;pecially when Popery prevails &s;o mightily over all <HI>Europe,</HI> and the Papi&s;ts compa&s;s Sea and Land to gain Pro&s;elites; Nor doth the Remotne&s;s, Danger and Barbarities of <HI>China, Japan, Tartary,</HI> and all the back parts of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plantations di&s;courage or faint their Zeal.</P>
<P N="7">VII. That therefore, it is the undoubted Intere&s;t and Duty of all Prote&s;tants, to &s;up|port this Colony in the <HI>Scots</HI> hands, who have the only ju&s;t Right thereto; and in who&s;e Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, it mu&s;t certainly prove more beneficial to all other Prote&s;tant King|dom and States, than any other more wealthy and powerful Kingdom or State would &s;uffer it to be unto the re&s;t, if they did po&s;&s;e&s;s it alone. And it mu&s;t be the unque&s;tion|able duty of all true hearted <HI>Scots</HI> Men to endeavour by all Ju&s;t, Legal, and orderly ways, the Pre&s;ervation of their own Colony.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. That whatever has been the Cau&s;e of the late Di&s;a&s;ter of <HI>Caledonia,</HI> yet mo&s;t Evident it is, that the Colony cannot now be pre&s;erved to <HI>Scotland,</HI>
