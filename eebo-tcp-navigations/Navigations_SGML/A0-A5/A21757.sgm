<P>_WHereas certayne ob&s;tinate and irrepentant traytours, after theyr notorious rebellions made again&s;t this theyr naturall countrey, haue fledde out of the &s;ame, and haue remayned in forraigne partes, with a continual &amp; wylful de|termination (as it appeareth) to contriue al the mi&s;cheefe that they can ima|gine, to impeache and &s;ubuerte the vniuer&s;all quietne&s;&s;e and peace of this Realme, whereof they do behold with deadly enuie this theyr natural coun|trey, by Gods &s;peciall grace directyng her Maie&s;tie in her gouernment, to haue ben of long tyme mo&s;te comfortably po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, both inwardly at home, and with al outwarde countreyes next adioynyng: and that nowe &s;ynce they haue wa&s;ted theyr whole tyme for the pro&s;ecutyng of theyr rooted malice, by congregatyng them&s;elues to|gether in routes, with &s;hewes of conuenticles, and of forces, (wherin they haue condemned and de&s;pi&s;ed &s;uch of their former companions, as haue duetifully &s;ought for mercy for their offences) and by combination with others of this countrey byrth, of lyke di&s;po&s;ition, beyng founde as per&s;ons vagarant and wylful fugitiues, they haue &s;ought by and with them to excite by al kinde of &s;ini&s;ter meanes, diuers e&s;tates and gouernours a|broade, to mi&s;lyke, and to enter into enimitie agayn&s;t the Queenes Maie&s;tie, her Realme, and people: and that notwith&s;tandyng the&s;e theyr labours and practi&s;es, they &s;ee that neyther they haue nor coulde preuaile as they de&s;yred, by rea&s;on of the great wy&s;dome, honour, and graue con&s;yderation of the &s;ayde per&s;ons of e&s;tate, whom they haue muche troubled and annoyed with theyr importunate &s;uites and clamours, and &s;pe|cially with theyr fal&s;e, malitious, and traiterous &s;ugge&s;tions, and calumniations again&s;t the Queenes Ma|ie&s;tie, her gouernment, and this Realme: Therefore at the la&s;t beyng de&s;perate of tho&s;e theyr former tra|uayles and practi&s;es, and fyndyng her Maie&s;ties amitie is had in good e&s;timation with other the greate prynces and e&s;tates her neyghbours, and the amitie al&s;o of the &s;ame princes reciprocquely imbraced by her Maie&s;tie, to the honour and benefite both of her Maie&s;tie, and her alies and confederates, and their coun|treyes and &s;ubiectes, they are fallen into another crooked cour&s;e of malitious per&s;ecutyng the happy e&s;tate of this countrey and gouernment, by choo&s;yng out of certayne &s;hamele&s;&s;e, &s;piteful, and furious braynes, ha|uyng a trade in pennyng of infamous libelles, not only in the Engli&s;he, but al&s;o in Latine, &amp; other &s;trange languages. And by the&s;e meanes they haue lately cau&s;ed certayne &s;editious bookes and libelles to be compi|led, and printed in diuers languages, wherein theyr final intention appeareth to be to bla&s;pheme, and as it were to accur&s;e theyr natiue countrey, with al manner of reprocheful tearmes, agayn&s;t the peaceable go|uernment thereof, condemnyng generally the whole pollicie of the pre&s;ent e&s;tate, as hauing no religion, nor pietie, nor iu&s;tice, nor order, no good mini&s;ters at al, either for diuine or humane cau&s;es: &amp; yet to abu&s;e &s;uch as are &s;trangers to the &s;tate, they haue glo&s;ed &s;ome of theyr late libelled bookes with argumentes of di&s;coueries of trea&s;ons, intended, as they do craftily alleage, by &s;ome &s;pecial per&s;ons beyng coun&s;aylers, agayn&s;t her Maie&s;tie, and the &s;tate of this crowne and Realme, with reprocheful tearmes of mo&s;t notorious fal&s;e a&s;|&s;ertions and allegations: bendyng theyr mallice mo&s;te &s;pecially agayn&s;t two, who be certaynely knowen to haue alwayes ben mo&s;te &s;tudiou&s;ly and faythfully careful of her Maie&s;ties pro&s;perous e&s;tate, and vertuous gouernment, employing therto al theyr cares, trauayles, diligence, and watchyng, with the manife&s;t lo&s;&s;e and hynderaunce of theyr owne health, that no trea&s;on myght approche to hurte her hyghne&s;&s;e, nor trayte|rous malice to di&s;turbe the quiet of her pro&s;perous raigne. The&s;e cheefely, be&s;yde theyr general reproouing of al other, hauyng charge in this gouernment, they &s;tudie by theyr venemous and lying bookes, to haue &s;pe|cially my&s;lyked of her Maie&s;tie, contrary to theyr manyfolde de&s;ertes, &s;o approoued by long and manife&s;t ex|perience, whiche both her Maie&s;tie, and al the re&s;t of her good coun&s;aylours and nobilitie, with other the &s;tates of the Realme, haue had, and dayly haue of the very &s;ame coun&s;aylours, who al&s;o are the more to be allowed of her Maie&s;tie, in that &s;he &s;eeth, and of her owne meere knowledge truely vnder&s;tandeth, that al the perticuler matters wherewith the &s;ayde libellers labour to charge the &s;ayd coun&s;aylours, as offences, be vt|terly improbable &amp; fal&s;e, as in like maner generally, al others her Maie&s;ties coun&s;ellours, mini&s;ters, and &s;ub|iectes of vnder&s;tandyng, in euery degree, do repute, accept, &amp; know the &s;ame to be: &s;o as both of her Maie&s;tie, &amp; of al other her good coun&s;aylers and noble men, this theyr attempt is vnder&s;tanded to be the worke of canck|red enuie and malice, and the accu&s;tomed wont of &s;uche men as be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with tho&s;e &s;pirites, when they
<PB REF="2"> can not, ne dare not openly a&s;&s;ayle her princely Maie&s;tie by force or open doynges, then to goe about to pull from her Maie&s;tie her faythful and tru&s;tie coun&s;aylours, by fal&s;e calumnies, or with faigned and &s;urmi&s;ed tales, to make variance, yf they coulde, gelou&s;ie, and di&s;corde amonges her highne&s;&s;e coun&s;aylours, who hy|therto with muche concorde and good agreement, haue, as it is wel &s;eene, &s;erued pro&s;perou&s;ly her hyghne&s;&s;e. And therefore her Maie&s;tie hauyng regarde to be thankeful to almyghtie God for his ble&s;&s;yng of her with his protection in her gouernment the&s;e many yeeres, and for that cau&s;e my&s;lykyng to &s;uffer the &s;ame to be in this &s;orte by &s;uche infamous libelles ob&s;cured, defamed, and bla&s;phemed, eyther pre&s;ently, or in time to come, by the &s;ecrete di&s;pear&s;yng of the &s;ame bookes and libelles, eyther within her Realme, or abroade in forraigne language: and in lyke manner, beyng vnwyllyng to haue &s;uche as be her wel tryed and approoued faythful &s;eruauntes and coun&s;aylours to be thereby taxed, altogeather with manyfe&s;t vntruethes impudently vtte|red, to the di&s;honour of her Maie&s;tie, to whom they are coun&s;ailours: hath therfore thought nece&s;&s;ary, and &s;o by aduice of others of her coun&s;ayle and nobilitie, who&s;e reputation is al&s;o mo&s;te certainely taxed by the &s;aid manyfe&s;t &s;launders and vntruethes, &s;he willeth that by this her Maie&s;ties publique declaration, it be know|en, that the &s;ayde bookes and libelles be of her Maie&s;tie, and of her coun&s;ayle, e&s;teemed, iudged, and condem|ned, to be the workes of de&s;pi&s;ers of Gods true religion, of ob&s;tinate traytours again&s;t her Maie&s;ties per&s;on, e&s;tate, and dignitie, &amp; of vnnatural and malignant enuiers of the common good tranquilitie of her Realme, who the more to abu&s;e &s;ome &s;ympler &s;ort of people, do delyuer a &s;hewe of certayne thynges pretended for the &s;afetie of her Maie&s;ties per&s;on and e&s;tate, the &s;ame beyng in deede mo&s;te manyfe&s;t and direct practi&s;es to ruine her per&s;on, and to ouerthrowe her e&s;tate: And therewith chargeth al manner of per&s;ons, to de&s;pi&s;e, re|iect, and de&s;troy &s;uche bookes and libelles, when&s;oeuer they &s;hal come to theyr handes, for the malitious &s;launders and vntruethes conteyned in them, and that no man wyllyngly do bryng into this Realme, di&s;|pear&s;e, di&s;po&s;e, or delyuer to any other, or keepe any of the &s;ayde bookes or libelles without de&s;troying, excepte the &s;ame per&s;on be one of her Maie&s;ties priuie coun&s;ayle, or otherwy&s;e for rea&s;onable re&s;pectes, be duely li|cen&s;ed to haue the &s;ame to peru&s;e, and to reprooue, accordyng to the qualitie thereof, vpon payne to be by any publique officer, who may haue notice thereof, apprehended, and thereupon to be puni&s;hed as &s;owers of &s;e|dition, and abbettours to the trea&s;ons vttered in the &s;ame <HI>.xxviij. die Septembr. 1573.</HI></P>
