<P>THe confirmation of the unhappy encounter of Generall <HI>Lamboy</HI> with the Weymari&s;h Armie, I have under&s;tood out of your la&s;t Letter; and upon the con&s;ideration of many circum&s;tan|ces, I can conclude nothing el&s;e, but that this defeat and overthrow was for the mo&s;t part over|&s;eene, and proceeded out of a meere ambition, becau&s;e he had under his command good old beaten &s;ouldiers, and Field-mar&s;hall <HI>Hatsfeld</HI> with
<PB N="2" REF="4">his Troops was not above a dayes marching from him, with whom he &s;hould have joyned. Without this overthrow we had been ma&s;ters in the field every where, but God intended to vi&s;it and humble us. Upon the receipt of this unplea|&s;ant news, Arch-Duke <HI>Leopold William</HI> was con|firmed the more in his heroicall re&s;olution, and furthered the marching of the Armies hither|wards, and again&s;t the Swedes, and ye&s;terday ar|rived hereabouts about Weidel &amp; Tangermund: Whereupon the Swedes hearing of our com|ming, moved likewi&s;e their former quarters, and marched with their maine &s;trength and power towards Saltzwedel, where they ly now. We &s;eek nothing el&s;e, but to meet them in the&s;e eaven and flat fields, and to force them to a battaile, being confident, that with our Cavallerie, which is in a good ca&s;e, we &s;hall over-match them, and within three or foure dayes we &s;hall lay a Ship-bridge over the river of Elve, either here or &s;omewhat lower, that in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity we may the better draw the Sile&s;ian Armie to us.
