<P>What&s;oever dangers are threatned or feared, either by the great perplexity I am at this pre&s;ent in (or by rea&s;on of my manifold &s;ins that now in my weakne&s;s lie heavy upon my Con&s;cience,) yet I have a&s;&s;urance, that if I confe&s;s and for&s;ake them <HI>(as I have no &s;uch inten|tion)</HI> I &s;hall find mercy.</P>
<P>Therefore I confe&s;s and acknowledge (but not from the bottom of my heart) that for the &s;pace of the&s;e 12 years I have been a mo&s;t cruel murderer, not onely of Bodies, but of Souls; that I have perjur'd my &s;elf, Fir&s;t by my Oath of All giance, and &s;econdly by my Solemn <HI>Covenant,</HI> wherein (as in <HI>Ho&s;.</HI> 1.9,) I have &s;poken words, &s;wearing fal&s;ly in making a Covenant; &s;pringeth up again&s;t me) like Hemlock in the furrows of the field: That I have mo&s;t Trayterou&s;ly betrayed, and murdered my lawful King, the Anointed of the Lord, that I have made Gods Hou&s;e and the Kings hou&s;e a <HI>Den of Thieves:</HI> that I have loved wickedne&s;s, and practi&s;ed it; that no fear hath dehorted me from doing any thing <HI>(but Ju&s;tice)</HI> that I have robbed both God &amp; the King, and have not feared the one nor honored the other: that I have u&s;ed all manner of jugglings, Cou&s;enage, contradictions and Equivoca|tions, that my Religion hath been Railing, Bla&s;phemy; Trea&s;on and Tautalogies,</P>
