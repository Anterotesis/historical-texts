<P>AS God by his Grace having inclined my Heart to be Merciful, and I have had the Comfort of doing Good; whil&s;t I had an opportunity, in the things as he in this Life is plea&s;ed to commit to my Care: I have, as in his &s;ight, walked in the uprightne&s;s of my Heart, and as in tho&s;e things partaining to this Life, I have endeavoured to keep a good Con&s;cience. So in Love to all that may have the Read|ing of this &s;mall Book, I am willing to give them an under&s;tanding, as I have found where it is to be attained; as Chri&s;t &s;aid, <HI>There is but one good, and that is God;</HI> and as we come be guided by his good Spirit, it will lead us into all things that are good; without which we cannot in|herit <HI>Eternal Life.</HI> And whatever any may think of me, who look with an evil Eye, yet to my <HI>Friends</HI> that looks with an Im|partial Eye, it will be received, as it is intended good will to all; and to tho&s;e re|main a Friend.</P>

<P>Thus have I given a &s;hort but true Account as I have pa&s;&s;ed through the Wilderne&s;s of this World, and have &s;een many fall on the Right Hand, and on the Left, where al&s;o I might but have had for my pre&s;ervation, the cloud over me by day to keep me low, that I might not be exalted, neither by Vi&s;ions, Sights, nor Revelations; many have been hurt thereby, and ca&s;t that on others, which concerned them&s;elves: And as the cloud &s;tood over me, it kept me low from &s;elf-exaltation, to know my &s;elf nothing, but what I received from the God of all my Mercies: and as I &s;ee the <HI>Cloud by day,</HI> I al&s;o &s;ee the <HI>Pillar of Fire by Night,</HI> which cau&s;ed me to &s;tand &s;till, and &s;ee the Sal|vation of God, and the bright appea|rance of his Glory.

<PB N="13" REF="8">the God of <HI>Jacob,</HI> that you &s;hould depart from him? But let all the &s;trong will'd, know little <HI>David,</HI> who tru&s;ts not in Bow nor Sword, but in the living God; he by his Sling and &s;mooth <HI>Stone,</HI> &s;hall hit the Head of tho&s;e that defies the Armies of <HI>I&s;rael</HI>'s God.</P>
<P>And to all you workers of Iniquity, who have charged us that we deny <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us</HI> come in the <HI>Fle&s;h,</HI> the Holy <HI>Scrip|tures</HI> and the <HI>Re&s;urrection,</HI> and &s;ay we are <HI>Heathens,</HI> and <HI>Hereticks,</HI> all which we know to be fal&s;e, and can appeal to God in the integrity of our Hearts therein, and with him we can with Joy leave our Cau&s;e, as well-knowing he is able in his time to plead it, tho' there may be evil doers among&s;t us. If <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> had one in twelve, that was not enough for the Jews and &s;ome that followed him, to &s;ay he was not in the Truth, becau&s;e <HI>Judas</HI> be|trayed him, and <HI>Peter</HI> deny'd him, and he in that Agony bearing our griefs, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 53. to cry out, <HI>My God my God why ha&s;t thou for&s;aken me,</HI> all this mu&s;t needs &s;tum|ble the Eye that looked out, but they remembred his promi&s;e, and waited at <HI>Je|ru&s;alem</HI> for the fulfilling of it, who &s;aid, he would come, and he did come, which
<PB N="14" REF="9">confirmed them, and &s;o it hath done us.</P>
<P>And now &s;omething to you my dear Children, whom I never deck'd in the extreams of formality, to make my &s;elf, or you &s;eem what you were not; but this was, and is my de&s;ire for you, &s;eek fir&s;t the Kingdom of Heaven, and the Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s thereof, and all other things &s;hall be added unto you, be &s;ure to <HI>Remember your Creator in the days of your Youth,</HI> and you &s;hall find the Comfort of it in your Old Age, or at your Death, when all the Glory of this World will &s;tand you in no &s;tead: And though &s;ome of you have met with &s;ome Di&s;appointments, yet you &s;hall find (as I have done) all things work to|gether for good, and bring you nearer to God, which I have ever de&s;ired for you, more than for Silver or Gold, tho' there|in &s;ome of you have had a ble&s;&s;ing beyond my de&s;ire, and my comfort is, you all &s;et your Faces <HI>Sion-ward,</HI> and to your Pa|rents have been Dutiful, Loving and O|bedient, for which God will ble&s;s you, as you continue in his Grace.</P>
<P>This is written by one that hath been called a <HI>Di&s;&s;enting Quaker,</HI> which I de|&s;ire not to be from faithful Friends, for
<PB N="15" REF="9">I never knowingly di&s;&s;ented from the Truth, but loved it, and though in &s;ome things was not &s;atisfied, yet kept as near as I could in Word and Deed to hurt no <HI>one,</HI> but endeavoured to an&s;wer a good Con&s;cience towards God and all Men, in which I have found him near to help me, and the ble&s;&s;ing to my Soul and Body, and have a true Love to all the &s;incere in Heart, by what name &s;oever called.</P>
<P>And as through Di&s;pen&s;ations and Ad|mini&s;trations and Gifts, (which are all by the &s;ame Spirit) God is plea&s;ed to give a further manife&s;tation of Him&s;elf, who is a Spirit, in that way &s;hews Him&s;elf to Man as he can receive him, which was, and is his great Love, knowing how hap|py he is made by it, and unhappy with|out it, and God's great Conde&s;cen&s;ion therein, who &s;eeks Man, before Man &s;eeks Him, becau&s;e he is good, and would have Us be like unto Him, and take delight in Us, and we in Him: and in this way he led all his faithful People, before the <HI>Law</HI> and after, which <HI>Law</HI> was given by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> by Divine In&s;piration, many Years after &s;ome of tho&s;e things were done, which all had their &s;ignification, and pointed at <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us</HI> coming in the
